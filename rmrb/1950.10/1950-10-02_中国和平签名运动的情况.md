The Secretariat of the Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace accepted the Peace Declaration of the Stockholm Conference of the World Peace Congress Committee and issued a circular to all regions, people's organizations, and democratic parties throughout the country on April 28, calling on the people of the whole country to actively participate in the peace signature campaign. Over the past five months, 34 large and small branches and sub-branches have been established across the country, and the peace signature campaign has spread to every village in the six major administrative regions, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, 12 major cities, nine administrative offices, and 29 provinces of the country. The work of opposing aggressive war and defending world peace has become a movement enthusiastically supported by the broad masses in China. The Chinese people have already made a significant contribution to world peace with their great revolutionary victory, and now they are contributing their strength to the sacred cause of defending world peace with more than 138 million peace signatures.

Three Stages

The process of the Chinese people's peace signature campaign can be divided into three stages.

In the first stage of the peace signature campaign (mid-May to the end of June), the organized masses in general cities were mobilized and preparations were made to carry out the peace signature campaign in depth and extensively. During this period, major cities across the country established large and small branches of the peace committees, and united local people's organizations, democratic parties, and government agencies to organize publicity and launch signatures, so that 90% to 100% of the organized masses signed their names. In larger cities, such as Beijing and Tianjin, the number of signatures quickly exceeded one-half or even two-thirds of the total population of the respective regions. In this stage, the total number of signatures was nearly 30 million, accounting for 6% of the country's population. At the same time, due to the gradual increase in the understanding of defending world peace, a large number of activists emerged in the signature collection work. The Chinese Peace Committee organized a propaganda group for the defense of world peace, led by Xiao San, to go to various places to further expand the scope of the peace signature campaign.

The second stage (early July to mid-August) was after the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea by US imperialism. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference had already issued a call for a week of peace signature campaign from July 1 to July 7, which made the movement against US aggression against Taiwan and Korea more closely integrated with the peace signature campaign. The peace signature campaign began to develop from organized masses to unorganized masses. The brutal aggressive face of US imperialism was once again exposed to the Chinese people. Our education combining internationalism and patriotism not only increased the number of signatures from nearly 30 million to more than 50 million during this period, but more importantly, it also enabled the broad masses of unorganized people to begin to organize. Everyone saw the victory of the Korean people and further recognized that although US imperialism is brutal, it is essentially a paper tiger. As long as we unite, any conspiracy of US imperialism can be defeated.

The third stage (after mid-August) was when US imperialism continued to expand its Far East aggression conspiracy despite the opposition of the people of the world. The Chinese Peace Committee issued a call on August 13 to "expand the peace signature campaign and strive for 200 million people to participate in the signature." It adopted the policy of closely integrating the peace signature campaign with the struggle against US aggression and vigorously promoted the peace signature campaign to small and medium-sized cities and rural areas. At the same time, at the request of the broad masses of the people, various people's organizations formed a Chinese people's delegation to visit the Korean people. After returning to China, the delegation conveyed to the Chinese people the heroic patriotic spirit of the Korean people that they had witnessed and the extremely shameless and brutal behavior of the US imperialists in contrast. The people of our country knew that the brutal US imperialism was obstructing our liberation of Taiwan, so they naturally realized that the interests of the Korean people and the interests of the Chinese people were consistent. Therefore, when signing their names enthusiastically, everyone expressed infinite indignation at the aggression of US imperialism. For example, an artilleryman from the North China Military Region said when signing his name: "Tell the US imperialists that we have seized American-made cannons. If you dare to launch a war, we will eliminate you." Comrade Liu Zhengmin, who had participated in the revolution for 22 years and lost his right hand in the war, said after signing his name with his left hand: "If the warmongers dare to launch a war, I will dedicate my only remaining left hand to the battle to defend the motherland." Under the agitation of such patriotic emotions, the number of signatures rose sharply. The number of condolence letters sent to the Korean People's Army from all over the country also increased sharply. By "August 15," the "Chinese People's Committee Against US Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea" alone had received more than 7,000 such letters. At the end of August, the planes of the US aggressive forces in Korea unreasonably shot and killed our people on the northeastern border, so the anti-aggression rage was even more magnificent and magnificent, and the broad masses of the people affirmed that the US imperialists are our mortal enemies. The number of peace signatures jumped from more than 50 million to more than 130 million in this stage.

Three Characteristics

China's peace signature campaign showed three characteristics.

First, China's peace signature campaign is combined with the high political consciousness of the Chinese people. As the conspiracy of US imperialism to expand its aggression in Asia was fully exposed, Chinese peace signatories deeply realized that supporting the patriotic spirit of the Korean people and opposing the aggressive actions of US imperialism are inseparable from the cause of defending world peace. Everyone knows that the most effective contribution to the cause of peace is to further consolidate the fruits of revolutionary victory. For example, the commanders and fighters of a certain company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Fujian unanimously stated: "Our peace signature is not to seek peace from the enemy or fear war, but it is a major demonstration to the imperialist warmongers. We must resolutely take Taiwan and Jinmen to answer the armed intervention of US imperialism and strive for lasting peace." The commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Northwest Military Region wrote in their resolution: "Although we are holding weapons, we love peace very much. At the same time, we are not afraid of war. If US imperialism dares to invade our motherland, we will resolutely eliminate it." Fu Guobin, a labor model from Miyun County, Hebei Province, said: "If the US imperialists dare to launch a war, I will fight them with my old life!" Workers in the carbon field of the Andong State-owned Machine Factory spontaneously launched a peace signature campaign. In the past, the daily production of carbon rods could only reach about seven or eight, but in July, the daily output reached 15 to 16, and the task of producing 1,600 carbon rods in ten months was completed five months and eight days ahead of schedule. Shi Haijun, a student at Renmin University of China, said: "We must use practical actions to express our desire for peace, earnestly learn all kinds of knowledge to build the motherland. The stronger the new China is built, the more it will strengthen the forces of peace, and the more US imperialism will not dare to launch a new war."

Second, the Chinese people have undergone a long period of war testing and know how to fight for justice. Therefore, they have shown great determination in the movement to defend world peace. Chai Xuejiu, a one-armed blasting hero of the People's Liberation Army and battalion commander of a certain engineering battalion, wrote his name with his left arm and said: "Although I have lost an arm, my remaining arm has defeated countless enemies in the past eight or nine years. It will join the thousands upon thousands of powerful arms of the entire Chinese people to jointly eliminate the aggressive behavior of US imperialism." The powerful words expressed the determination to defend the motherland and defend world peace. This love for peace has also made the Chinese people express it in various different forms, but also in the forms they consider most determined. In the signatures of the peasants, they all pressed their fingerprints on the signature book according to rural customs, and some sealed it with red paper and wrote on it: "We want peace and demand the prohibition of atomic bombs." Some drew a cross under their names to indicate an oath. For example, the nuns in Wuhan signed their names in a circle on yellow paper. They said that the circle represents unity, and there must be unity to have strength.

Third, the development of the peace signature campaign is comprehensive and in-depth. From the Central People's Government to the people's governments at all levels, from the members of the National Committee of the CPPCC to the various parties, people's organizations, large, medium, and small cities and villages, and people of all strata, men and women, old and young of different beliefs and occupations have participated in this peace signature campaign. Therefore, it is no accident that the number of peace signatures across the country exceeded 130 million by the end of September.

Work Experience

The work of collecting peace signatures in the past five months has created many experiences. The main points are as follows:

First, boldly mobilizing the masses is the main link for the vigorous development of peace signatures, because first of all, our movement is based on the universal desire of the broad masses of the people. For example, during the Peace Signature Week in Shanghai, due to boldly mobilizing and reaching the masses, relying on the masses, more than 20,000 people were mobilized to publicize in a very short period of time, applying more than 20 kinds of propaganda methods, forming a signature boom, and more than 3 million people signed their names in one week.

Second, a wide-ranging mass movement must have unified leadership. The movement can be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. The effective ways to organize signature propaganda work are mainly three: one is like what Tianjin has adopted. The various groups and units jointly promote it, and the various groups and units implement it to the grassroots organized masses, and then further popularize it to the general residents who are not yet organized. The second is like what Tangshan, Hebei Province, has adopted. The city is divided into seven districts, established the Peace Movement District Committee, and established 180 signature stations, forming a comprehensive signature network (at the same time, it is also a propaganda network), and a propaganda team composed of more than 20,000 workers, students, teachers, and government cadres to conduct in-depth propaganda. The third is like what Chongqing has adopted, combining the first two methods, crisscrossing, and establishing a daily telephone reporting system, with special personnel in charge of liaison work, which has received great results.

Third, when carrying out peace signature propaganda, it is necessary to combine it with the current situation, the actual local situation, and the specific business of various departments. In various places, at the memorial gatherings of Labor Day, Children's Day, "July 1," and "July 7," they were combined with these memorial festivals, and the slogan of defending world peace was put forward, which achieved remarkable results. Combining the signature movement with the actual local situation and the specific business of various departments also has the effect of actively carrying out the movement. All more than 6,000 miners of the Fengfeng Coal Mine signed their names in the workplace, and all signed their names within three days. On the one hand, Shandong Peixian cadres explained to the peasants that the disaster was the root of the evil left by the past imperialism and reactionary rule. On the other hand, they also cooperated with the current central work of disaster relief, loan seeds, preventing summer famine, and repairing dikes to carry out propaganda and education on defending world peace. The peasants' awareness of signing their names in the local area has therefore greatly increased. Seven mosques in Chahar conducted a worship to spread the truth of peace, so that the Hui women who had never been willing to tell their names this time rushed to sign their names and solemnly pressed their fingerprints.

Fourth, during the movement, we should collect the feedback from the masses at any time, and conduct propaganda and education in a timely manner in response to their ideological concerns. The most common is to doubt the role of signatures. We should let every signatory know that the people represented by thousands of signatures are the great force that effectively stops war.

Fifth, we should make full use of various propaganda tools, and the methods should be as flexible as possible. For example, in rural areas, the peace signature movement must take peasant association members and primary school teachers as the backbone. The propaganda methods should be lively and festive. Such as yangko opera, waist drum, martial arts, drum lyrics, peep shows, cartoons, rooftop broadcasts, etc., which are popular with the masses, can be used. The content should be simple and clear, easy to understand, and popular, and must be combined with the masses' personal experience for propaganda. For example, combined with the preparatory work for land reform, from the oppression of peasants by landlords to the fact that imperialism and landlords are in the same family and are the enemies of the peasants. For the peasants who have already been turned over, it is necessary to explain to them how the land was obtained and how life is gradually getting better. To maintain all this, the enemy must never be allowed to launch another war of aggression. Liu Zhenqing, a turned-over peasant in the suburbs of Beijing, said when signing his name: "I just knocked down his (imperialism's) running dog—the landlord—and he wants to fight again, not allowing us to live a good life." This is clear evidence that this kind of propaganda is effective.

Sixth, in villages and towns, written propaganda is generally not applicable, and other propaganda methods besides writing should be used more. When the Beijing Youth Service Department Propaganda Team went to the countryside, it distributed many "peace window decorations," mainly in the form of pattern paintings, with simple slogans written on the leaflets, which achieved better propaganda results. Laiyang, Shandong, used chat to talk about the great truth of peace and prosperity in the world when the peasants were cooling off in the evening. Datong City, Chahar, used the Hengshan Temple Fair to carry out propaganda. These methods mobilized many peasants to participate in the signature campaign.

Seventh, an important link in the peace signature movement is to generally set up signature stations, which should be decorated solemnly and have someone in charge of explaining, otherwise it will become a cold stall.

Political Gains

As of the end of September, China's peace signature campaign has collected more than 138 million signatures. It is still in progress, striving to reach the goal of 200 million people before the opening of the Second World Peace Congress. This is a great contribution to the cause of world peace. At the same time, this solemn and great movement has also brought some important political gains, which are listed as follows:

First, the broad masses of the people have taken a major political lesson from this peace signature movement and cultivated an internationalist viewpoint. Ordinary people are more concerned about international affairs. Everyone regards the struggles of the people of all countries as the same as their own affairs. Here is an example. An old lady named Gao Yuquan in Beijing met a Korean woman when collecting peace signatures in Zhongshan Park, and expressed to her her anger at the bloody crimes of the United States in Korea and her respect for the Korean people who are fighting heroically. The Korean woman said: "I am very grateful that you are conducting a peace signature to help our country fight against US aggression." At that time, the two of them were so excited that they hugged each other and shed tears.

Second, in the peace signature movement, the people of the whole country reviewed their own powerful strength, thereby strengthening their confidence and determination to defend world peace. On the other hand, they have a deeper understanding of the aggressive nature of US imperialism. After the US plane shot and killed our northeastern worker compatriots on August 27, a shoemaker in the suburbs of Beijing who signed the peace declaration said: "Now I understand. The fighting in Korea is also caused by the old American devils."

Third, through the signature movement, governments at all levels throughout the country have further established close contact with the local people. Local governments often combine the peace signature movement with policy propaganda and work review.

Fourth, in the peace signature movement, mass organizations in various parts of the country have greatly developed, and the work of various departments has also been promoted. For example: (A) The local branches and sub-branches of the Chinese Peace Committee and the Peace Signature Committee have greatly increased (from the original 11 branches to 34). (B) The members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have expanded. Since the launch of the peace signature campaign in Jilin Province, by the end of August, a total of more than 12,000 members of the Friendship Association have been developed. (C) The members of the Shanghai Family Women's Federation have expanded. After the Shanghai Family Women's Federation carried out peace signature propaganda in the form of symposiums, many women immediately requested to join the Women's Federation and formed groups on the spot to express their desire to take action. Other examples are too numerous to mention.

Fifth, a large number of activists have emerged in the movement, laying the foundation for future work.

Sixth, a propaganda network has been generally established in various units throughout the country, and a large number of propaganda cadres have been trained.

Welcoming the Second World Peace Congress

The Standing Committee Executive Bureau of the World Peace Congress has decided to hold the Second World Peace Congress in the United Kingdom from November 13 to 19 this year. Now there is less than a month and a half before the congress date. We want to welcome the Second World Peace Congress with the peace signatures of 200 million people across the country. We must intensify our efforts to collect 62 million new signatures in this short period of time to achieve our goal. At the same time, in accordance with the resolution of the World Peace Congress Executive Bureau, we must actively take the following four actions: (1) Resolutely prohibit atomic weapons; (2) Demand universal disarmament under international control; (3) Prohibit any country from using various means to promote war; (4) Expose aggression wherever it occurs and condemn armed intervention in the internal affairs of any country. In accordance with the same spirit, we must strive for the United Nations General Assembly to adopt the Soviet Union's program for establishing lasting peace. Only such concerted efforts can contribute to the victory of the Second World Peace Congress. (September 30) (Attached chart)

### 中国和平签名运动的情况

　　中国和平签名运动的情况
    中国保卫世界和平大会委员会接受了世界保卫和平大会委员会斯德哥尔摩会议的和平宣言以后，即于四月二十八日对全国各地区、各人民团体、各民主党派发出通告，号召全国人民积极参加和平签名运动。五个月来，全国各地成立了三十四个和大分、支会，和平签名运动遍及于全国六大行政区和内蒙自治区、十二个大城市、九个行署、二十九个行省和二千零八十五县的每一个乡村。反对侵略战争保卫世界和平的工作，在中国已经成为广大群众所热烈支持的运动。中国人民，已经以伟大的革命胜利对世界和平作了重大贡献，现在又以一亿三千八百多万的和平签名对保卫世界和平的神圣事业贡献出了自己的力量。
    三个阶段
    中国人民进行和平签名运动的过程，可分三个阶段来说。
    在和平签名运动第一阶段中（五月中旬至六月底），一般城市中有组织的群众都动员起来，并做好了深入和广泛的开展和平签名运动的准备工作。在这段期间内，全国各主要城市都成立了和大的分支会，并联合了当地各人民团体、民主党派及政府机关，部队组织宣传、发动签名，使有组织的群众的百分之九十到一百都签了名。在较大的城市，如北京、天津等地的签名人数很快就超过了各该地区全人口的二分之一乃至三分之二。这阶段总计签名人数近三千万，占全国人口百分之六。同时，由于对保卫世界和平认识的逐渐提高，在征集签名工作中涌现了大批积极分子。中国和大委员会组织了保卫世界和平宣传团由萧三率领分赴各地，再进一步扩展了和平签名运动的范围。
    第二阶段（七月初至八月中旬）是在美帝侵略朝鲜的战争发生以后，中国人民政协全国委员会已经发出了七月一日至七日和平签名运动周的号召，这就使反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动与和平签名运动更密切的结合起来，和平签名运动开始由有组织的群众发展到无组织的群众。美帝国主义凶残的侵略面目再一次在中国人民面前暴露出来，我们所进行的国际主义和爱国主义相结合的教育，在这一期间不仅使签名人数由近三千万增至五千万以上，而更重要的是使广大的无组织群众也开始组织起来。大家看到了朝鲜人民的胜利，更认清了美帝国主义尽管残暴，但本质上是纸老虎，只要我们团结起来，美帝国主义的任何阴谋，都是可以击败的。
    第三阶段（八月中旬以后）正值美帝国主义不顾世界人民的反对，继续扩大远东侵略阴谋之际。中国和大委员会于八月十三日发出了“扩大和平签名运动、争取两万万人参加签名”的号召，采取和平签名运动和反对美国侵略的斗争密切结合起来的方针，向中小城市农村大力推进和平签名运动。同时，在广大人民的要求下，各人民团体组成了慰问朝鲜人民的中国人民代表团。代表团归国后，向全中国人民传达了他们亲眼目睹的朝鲜人民的英勇爱国精神和相对之下美帝国主义者的极端无耻的残暴行为。我国人民知道残暴的美帝正在阻挠我国解放台湾，也就很自然地认识到朝鲜人民的利益和中国人民的利益是一致的。因此在踊跃签名的时候，大家对美国帝国主义的侵略表示了无限的愤慨。例如华北军区一位炮兵在签名时说：“告诉美帝，我们缴获了美制大炮，如果你敢发动战争，我们就要把你消灭”。一位参加革命二十二年，在战争中失去了右手的刘正民同志，用左手签名之后说：“如果战争贩子们敢于发动战争，我将以仅存的左手供献给保卫祖国的战斗”。在这样的爱国情绪的激动之下，签名人数直线上升。全国各地寄给朝鲜人民军的慰问信也急剧增加，至“八·一五”为止，仅“中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜委员会”一处就收到此类信件七千件之多。八月底美国侵略朝鲜部队的飞机竟在我东北边境无理射杀我国人民，于是反侵略的怒涛更为雄伟壮阔，广大群众都肯定了美帝是我们的死敌。和平签名人数，在这一阶段由五千多万跃进至一亿三千万以上了。
    三个特点
    我国和平签名运动表现了三个特点。
    第一，我国的和平签名运动是和我国人民高度的政治觉悟结合起来的。由于美帝在亚洲扩大侵略的阴谋原形毕露，中国的和平签名者深切地体会到支持朝鲜人民的爱国主义精神，反对美帝的侵略行动是和保卫世界和平事业不可分的。大家知道，对和平事业的最有效的贡献，就是进一步巩固革命胜利的果实。例如驻防福建的人民解放军某部某连的指战员一致表示：“我们和平签名，并不是向敌人求和，怕战争，而是我们向帝国主义战争贩子大示威，我们要坚决打下台湾、金门来回答美帝国主义的武装干涉，争取持久和平。”西北军区某部指战员在决心书上写道：“虽然我们握着武器，但是我们万分热爱和平。同时，我们决不怕战争，如果美帝国主义胆敢侵略我们的祖国，那我们就要坚决地消灭它”。河北省密云县的劳动模范傅国彬说：“美帝胆敢发动战争，我拚这条老命跟它干！”安东国营机器工厂炭素场工人自发起和平签名运动后，过去每日生产炭精棒只能达到七、八根左右，到七月份，日产量已达到十五根至十六根，并提前五个月零八天完成了十个月生产炭精棒一千六百根的任务。中国人民大学石海君同学说：“我们要用实际行动来表现和平的愿望，认真地学习建设祖国的各种知识，新中国建设得愈强大，就愈增强和平力量，美帝就愈不敢发动新的战争。”
    第二，中国人民经过了长期的战争考验，懂得怎样为正义而战，因此在保卫世界和平运动中间表现了非常的坚决性。人民解放军独臂爆破英雄、某部工兵营长柴学久，用他的左臂写下了自己的名字，他说：“我虽然失掉了一条手臂，但是我剩下的一条手臂，八九年来战胜了无数的敌人，它将和全中国千千万万有力的手臂，共同消灭美帝国主义的侵略行为。”有力的语句表示出保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的决心。这种对和平的热爱也使得中国人民以各种不同的，但又是他们认为最坚决的形式表示出来。在农民的签名中，他们都按照农村习惯，在签名册上捺下了指印，有的并用红纸封上，在上面写着：“我们要和平、要求禁用原子弹”。有的在自己的名字下画个十字，表示宣誓的意思。又如武汉市的尼姑在黄纸上把她们的名字签成一个圆圈，她们说圆圈是表示团结，要团结才有力量。
    第三，和平签名运动的发展是全面性与深入的。从中央人民政府到各地各级人民政府，从政协全国委员会委员到各党派、各人民团体、各大中小城市乡村以及各阶层，各种不同信仰、不同职业的男女老少都参加了这一和平签名运动。因此，全国和平签名人数到九月底超过了一亿三千万，决不是偶然的。
    工作经验
    五个月来征集和平签名的工作，创造了许多经验，主要的几点如下：
    第一，大胆放手发动群众是和平签名蓬勃开展的主要的一环，因为首先我们这个运动是基于广大人民的普遍愿望的。例如上海市在和平签名运动周内，由于大胆放手深入群众，依靠群众，就在很短期内动员了二万多人来宣传，应用二十几种宣传办法，汇成签名热潮，一周内签名者就达三百多万人。
    第二，广泛的群众性运动，必须有统一领导。运动才能有计划、有步骤地进行。组织签名宣传工作的有效方式，主要有三种：一种是像天津所采取的。由各团体、单位联合推动，由各团体、单位分别贯彻到基层有组织群众，再进一步普及于一般尚无组织的居民。另一种是像河北省的唐山所采取的，将全市划分为七个区、建立了和运区委会，并设立了一百八十处签名站，组成了一个全面的签名网（同时又是宣传网），由工人、学生、教员、机关干部等二万余人组成的宣传队，进行深入宣传。第三种是像重庆所采取的，把前两种方式兼用，纵横交织，并且建立了每日电话汇报制，专人掌握联系工作，收到很大的效果。
    第三，在进行和平签名宣传时，要与当前的形势、当地的实际情况和各部门的具体业务相结合。各地在劳动节、儿童节、“七一”、“七七”的纪念集会上，都与这些纪念节日结合起来，提出了保卫世界和平的口号，获得了显著成绩。签名运动和当地的实际情况和各部门的具体业务结合起来，也有积极开展的功效。峰峰煤矿全体矿工六千余人，在工作场所进行签名，三天以内都签了名。山东沛县干部一方面向农民说明灾荒是过去帝国主义和反动统治留下的祸根，另一方面并配合当前救灾、贷种、防夏荒、修堤等中心工作，进行保卫世界和平的宣传教育。当地农民签名的自觉性因而大为增加。察哈尔七个清真寺作了传布和平真理的礼拜，使得从来不肯将名字告诉别人的回教妇女，这回都赶着签名，还郑重地捺上了手印。
    第四，在运动中应随时收集群众反映，针对其思想顾虑，及时地进行宣传教育。最普遍的是怀疑签名的作用，我们应该使每一个签名的人都知道千千万万签名所代表的人民，就是有效地制止战争的伟大力量。
    第五，应充分运用各种宣传工具，方式应力求灵活。例如在农村中，和平签名运动必须以农会会员，小学教员为骨干。宣传方式应求活泼热闹。如群众所喜闻乐见的秧歌剧、腰鼓、武术、鼓词、拉洋片、漫画、屋顶广播等方式都可采用。内容要简单明了、浅显通俗，并须联系群众切身经验进行宣传。例如结合土地改革的准备工作，从地主对农民的压迫说到帝国主义和地主是一家，是农民的敌人。对于业已翻了身的农民，要向他们说明田地是怎样得到的，日子又是怎样逐渐好起来的，要保持这一切，就绝对不允许敌人再来发动侵略战争。北京郊区的翻身农民刘振清在签名时说：“刚把他（帝国主义）的走狗——地主——打倒，他又想打仗，不叫咱过好日子。”就是这种宣传发生效果的明证。
    第六，在村镇中一般地不适用文字宣传，应多用文字以外的其他宣传方式。北京青年服务部宣传队下乡时，散发了许多“和平窗花”，以图案画为主，写着一些简单口号的传单，得到了较好的宣传效果。山东莱阳在农民傍晚纳凉时，用闲谈的方式讲述天下太平的大道理。察哈尔大同市利用恒山庙会来进行宣传。这些方式都动员了许多农民参加签名运动。
    第七，和平签名运动的一个重要环节，就是普遍设立签名站，要布置得很隆重，有专人负责讲解，否则就会变成冷摊子了。
    政治上的收获
    中国和平签名运动截至九月底止，已经征集到一亿三千八百多万人的签名。目前还在继续进行，以求在第二次世界保卫和平大会开幕以前，达到二亿人的目标。这是对于世界和平事业的伟大贡献。同时这一庄严伟大的运动还带来了一些重要的政治收获，列举如下：
    第一，广大的人民大众从这一次和平签名运动中间，上了政治大课，培养了国际主义观点。普通的人们对国际事务更关心了。大家把各国人民的斗争，看得正同自己的事情一样。这儿举个例吧。北京有一个老太太高玉泉在中山公园征集和平签名时，遇到了一个朝鲜妇女，便向她表示对于美国在朝鲜的血腥罪行的愤怒，以及对于英勇抗战的朝鲜人民的敬意。那朝鲜妇女说：“你们为了帮助我们的国家反对美国侵略，进行和平签名，我非常感激。”当时她们两人激动得互相拥抱，淌下泪来。
    第二，在和平签名运动中，全国人民检阅了自己的强大力量，从而加强了对保卫世界和平的信心与决心。在另一方面则更深刻地认清了美帝国主义的侵略本质。八月二十七日美机射杀我东北工人同胞后，北京郊区有一个在和平宣言上签了名的鞋匠说：“这一下我可明白了。朝鲜的打仗又是老美鬼子在捣鬼”。
    第三，通过了签名运动，全国各地各级政府进一步与当地人民取得了密切的联系。各地政府往往有结合着和平签名运动，进行政策宣传和工作检讨的。
    第四，在和平签名运动中间，全国各地群众组织大有发展，各部门工作也推进一步。例如：（甲）中国和大各地分会、支会、和平签名委员会大大的增加了（从原定的十一个分会扩展到三十四个）。（乙）中苏友好协会会员扩大了。吉林省自开展和平签名运动，至八月底为止，共发展了友协会员达一万二千余人。（丙）上海家庭妇联会员扩大了。上海家庭妇联以座谈会等方式进行和平签名宣传以后，有许多妇女立即要求加入妇联，并当场成立小组表示要行动起来。其他例子，不胜枚举。
    第五，在运动中涌现了大批积极分子，打下今后工作开展的基础。
    第六，全国各地各单位普遍地建立了宣传网，培养了大批的宣传干部。
  迎接第二次世界保卫和平大会
    世界保卫和平大会常设委员会执行局定于今年十一月十三日至十九日在英国召开第二次世界保卫和平大会。现在距大会日期，不到一个月半了。我们要以全国两亿人的和平签名来迎接第二次世界保卫和平大会。我们必须加紧努力，再在这短短的期间内，征集六千二百万人的新签名者，以达我们的目标。同时我们依照世界和大执行局的决议，必须积极采取下列四项行动：（一）坚决禁止原子武器；（二）要求在国际管制下，普遍裁减军备；（三）禁止任何国家采用各种方式宣传战争；（四）揭露任何地方发生的侵略，并谴责对任何国家内部事务的武装干涉。依照这同一的精神，我们要为争取联合国大会通过苏联的建立持久和平方案而进行斗争。只有这样的一致努力，才能促成第二次世界保卫和平大会的胜利。（九月三十日）（附图表）
