Amidst the national celebration of National Day, railway workers and factory employees across the country have successively completed their production plans as gifts for National Day. In the railway system, for example, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's train section launched a campaign to travel one million kilometers starting at midnight on March 24th. After more than 170 days of hard work, having taken 8,405 trains, by 2:00 AM on September 19th, they had completed 1,000,351 kilometers, setting a new record for the bureau. Despite unfortunately experiencing two accidents of responsibility during this period, they finally completed and exceeded the original plan to finish by October 1st ahead of schedule. The Luoyang Station's Operations Team A, from November 21st of last year to September 17th of this year, through the active efforts of all team members and the help of all comrades, overcame the imperfections of supplementary equipment with manpower, implemented joint labor, and successfully completed 300 days of accident-free operation. They also achieved 95% or better on-time departure for freight trains and 100% on-time departure for passenger trains. The Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot, thanks to the correct leadership of higher authorities, close cooperation from the Party, government, and labor union, and the hard work of all employees, launched a mass-based economy drive in January, February, and March, enabling the depot to basically complete this year's transportation and production tasks. The Northeast China Changchun Railway's Suihua Engineering Section proposed before National Day to safely achieve 953 days without accidents and to complete the annual road maintenance tasks half a month ahead of schedule. By September 15th, the road maintenance tasks had been completed ahead of schedule, and the guarantee of 953 days without accidents by October 1st could also be realized. The workers also proposed striving for the goal of 1,000 days without accidents. The Zhengjiatun Station also had no accidents from May to September, and saved over 702.5 million Northeast Yuan in material collection expenses. In addition, the workers of the Baichengzi Engineering Team paid attention to saving materials during construction, and their original production tasks were also completed more than ten days ahead of schedule. Workers repairing the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway in the Southwest region, in order to strive for a trial run of locomotives on the Jiulongpo to Dadukou section on National Day, worked overtime for days to repair the tracks and race against the rain to repair locomotives. The first locomotive finally ran on that section of railway on National Day. A certain unit of the Northwest region repairing the Tianbao Road also enthusiastically launched a new record campaign.

In addition, in the Northeast and other parts of the country, many factory workers, in the production competition to welcome National Day, completed their glorious tasks ahead of schedule or on time. For example, the Fushun Mining Bureau's Vehicle Factory completed its annual vehicle repair tasks one quarter and three days ahead of schedule. The last vehicle was completed and driven out on September 27th. All the workers were overjoyed, and they decided to name locomotive No. 1140 "National Day" and officially deploy it on the production front on October 1st. The vehicle repair project was carried out under difficult conditions in terms of both materials and technology. However, with the concerted efforts of all the factory's workers and the unity of technical personnel and workers, not only was the repair and assembly task completed on time, ensuring the transportation of the entire bureau, but also the annual production plan was completed within the third quarter. This was the first time this had happened in the Fushun Mining Bureau. State-owned and publicly-operated factories in Jilin City also established various systems under almost the same circumstances, united technical personnel and brought their enthusiasm into play, and completed their production plans ahead of schedule. The State-owned Jilin Chemical Plant's calcium carbide furnace created an unprecedented safety record since it was put into operation, completing the annual production task three months ahead of schedule on September 22nd. The employees of the plant's phosphorus production plant's lime kiln also completed their annual production tasks according to plan on September 16th and August 16th respectively. Other factories, such as State-owned Factory No. 41, Jiangnan Chemical Plant, and State-owned Paper Mill, also completed their production plans ahead of schedule. The Mudanjiang Enterprise Company's oil mill created a new record for oil production in the movement to promote the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group. For example, on September 18th, thanks to the leadership of the Fu Guo Group, the average oil production of Shifts B, C, and D (the entire factory is divided into four shifts) was 70 jin more than in the past; among them, Shift D was able to produce more than 200 jin more. The State-owned Andong Paper Mill also completed its third-quarter task five days ahead of schedule.

In other regions of the country, for example, the Datong Chemical Plant in Datong City, in the production plan to welcome National Day, adopted mutual challenge competitions, paying particular attention to the combination of technical personnel and workers, so that most of the plans for September exceeded the tasks. They also saved a lot in terms of coal consumption. The Anyang City Zhenyu Match Factory also achieved great results in production in September, especially with the factory's rack-arranging group achieving a daily output of 19 boxes; while the highest record in the first half of the year was only more than 16 boxes.

The number of smelting times in the No. 2 open hearth furnace of a certain steel plant in Chongqing reached a record high of 279 furnaces on the night of National Day. The workers happily sent a telegram to Chairman Mao to report the good news.

The production volume of each workshop of the Hubei Machinery Factory's Agricultural Reclamation Department exceeded the production plan by 6% to 29% in September. The workers continued to launch competitions to ensure the completion of the October production plan.

The yarn spindle production rate of Wuhan Shenxin Textile Factory increased by an average of 2.4%, and cotton yarn production also exceeded the predetermined competition target by 7.3%.

The two yarn factories in Chengdu, Dajing and Dachang, produced 111 cars of yarn per shift every ten hours, breaking the record since the establishment of the two factories.

In terms of transportation, the workers of the Wuhan Public Automobile Company completed the production plan of retrofitting 30 charcoal cars to welcome National Day as scheduled. On the morning of National Day, the workers excitedly drove the newly installed cars onto the streets.

In addition, some factories saw a large number of model deeds of saving materials and improving tools during the competition. The power consumption rate of the Enan Electric Power Company has dropped to 9.99%, saving 15.3% compared to July. Workers at the Hankou Power Plant used grinding wheel oilstones to sharpen scissors and cars, solving production needs and saving costs.

　　全国人民欢度国庆佳节声中
    各地职工频传生产捷报
    【本报讯】全国人民欢庆国庆节声中，各地铁路员工与工厂职工纷纷完成了生产计划，作为国庆献礼。在铁路系统中，如郑州铁路局列车段从三月二十四日零点开始的行走百万公里运动，经过一百七十余天的艰苦努力，乘了八千四百零五次列车，到九月十九日二时，即已完成一百万又三百五十一公里，创造了全局的新纪录。其间虽不幸出了两次责任事故，终于提前完成并超过了原定“十、一”完成的计划。洛阳车站运转甲班则自去年十一月二十一日起，截至本年九月十七日止，在全班职工积极努力及全体同志的帮助下，以人力克服补充设备的不健全，贯彻联合劳动，胜利完成了三百天运转无事故；并达到货物列车百分之九十五强、旅客车百分之百的正点开出。张家口机务段，由于上级的领导正确，以及党、政、工等各方面的密切配合与全体职工的努力工作，在一、二、三月份开展了群众性的节约大检查，使得该段把今年的运输与生产任务已在基本上完成。东北中长路绥工全体工友在国庆前曾提出要安全达成九百五十三天无事故，并提前半月完成全年养路补修任务。到九月十五日，养路补修任务已提前完成，到十月一日九百五十三日无责任事故的保证亦可实现。工友们并提出向一千日无事故的目标奋斗。郑家屯车站，从五月到九月亦未发生任何事故，并在收集材料上节省了开支东北币七亿零二千五百余万元。又白城子工务工程队的工友们在修建工作中，注意节省材料，其原定的生产任务亦按原定时间提前完成了十几天。西南区修筑成渝路的工人，为着争取国庆日在九龙坡到大渡口段试行机车，曾连日加班整修轨道，冒雨抢修机车，第一辆机车终于在国庆日行驶在该段铁路线上。西北整修天宝路的某军，亦热烈展开了新纪录运动。
    另外，在东北与关内各地，均有不少工厂职工，在迎接国庆的生产竞赛中，提前或按时完成了光荣的任务。如抚顺矿务局车辆厂即提前一季又三天完成了全年修车任务。最后一台车是在九月二十七日修竣驶出。全体工友欢欣鼓舞，他们并决定将该一一四○号电机车命名为“国庆号”，于十月一日正式出动在生产战线上。该厂的修车工程是在材料与技术均感受困难的情况下进行的。但在全厂工友一致努力、技术人员与工人团结一致的情况下，不但按时完成修配任务，保证了全局的运输，而且在第三季内即完成了全年的生产计划。这样的事情，在抚顺矿务局还是第一次。吉林市国公营工厂亦在差不多同样的情况下，建立了各种制度，团结了技术人员并发挥其积极性提前完成了生产计划。国营吉林化工厂电石炉创造了开炉以来前所未有的安全新纪录，提前三个月，于九月二十二日完成了全年的生产任务。该厂制磷厂石灰炉等职工亦按计划分别于九月十六日，八月十六日完成了全年的生产任务。其他如国营四一工厂、江南化学厂、国营造纸厂等亦提前完成了生产计划。牡丹江企业公司制油厂在推行马恒昌小组经验的运动中，创造了多出油的新纪录。如在九月十八日，由于傅国小组的带头，使乙、丙、丁三班（全厂分四班）的产油量，每班平均比过去多出七十斤；其中四班能多出二百多斤。国营安东造纸厂亦提前五天完成了第三季度的任务。
    关内则如大同市大同化学厂，在迎接国庆的生产计划中，曾采取了互相间的挑战竞赛，特别是注意了技术人员与工人的结合，使九月份的计划大部都超过任务。在用煤方面亦节省不少。安阳市振裕火柴厂在九月份内的生产亦有很大成绩，尤其是本厂的排杆组日产量达到十九箱；而上半年最高纪录仅为十六箱多。
    重庆某工厂炼钢场二号平炉冶炼次数，到国庆日之夜，达到了二百七十九炉的最高纪录，工人们高兴地打电报给毛主席报喜。
    湖北机械厂农垦处各车间九月份的生产量超过了生产计划百分之六到百分之二十九，工友们继续展开竞赛，以保证完成十月份的生产计划。
    武汉申新纱厂纱锭生产率平均提高了百分之二点四，棉纱产量也超过预定竞赛目标的百分之七点三。
    成都市大经和大昌两纱厂每班每十小时出纱达到一百一十一车，已打破了两厂创办以来的纪录。
    在交通事业方面，武汉市公用汽车公司的工人们如期完成了为迎接国庆节改装三十部木炭车的生产计划。在国庆节早晨，工人们兴奋地把新装好的汽车开上街去。
    此外，有些工厂在竞赛期间出现了大批节约材料、改进工具的模范事迹。鄂南电力公司用电率已降到百分之九点九九，比七月份节省了百分之十五点三。汉口电厂工人利用砂轮油石磨剪刀车，解决了生产上的需要，并节省了成本。
