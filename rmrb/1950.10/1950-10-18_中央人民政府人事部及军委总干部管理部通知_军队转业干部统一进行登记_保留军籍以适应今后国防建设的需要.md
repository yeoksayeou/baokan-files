Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government and the General Cadre Management Department of the Central People's Revolutionary Military Commission, in order to understand the situation of transferred military cadres, issued the "Notice on the Registration of Transferred Military Cadres," the full text of which is as follows:

　　Due to the development of the revolutionary situation and the needs of various national constructions, the People's Liberation Army has transferred a large number of cadres in recent years to work in local party, government, people's, financial and economic, cultural and educational, and foreign affairs departments; however, there has been no unified registration work. Now, in order to understand the situation of transferred cadres and retain their military status to meet the needs of future national defense construction, the following decisions are made:

　　(1) All cadres above the rank of platoon leader in the original People's Liberation Army who have been transferred to work in various local departments shall retain their military status and be reserve cadres of the People's Liberation Army. When major strategic regions issue Liberation Medals, they should be issued to all cadres who originally served in the armies of each region and have now been transferred, as well as to demobilized cadres and soldiers.

　　(2) All transferred cadres must fill out two copies of the military transfer cadre registration form (forms will be issued separately), which will be kept separately by the provincial military region in the area where they are located, or the cadre management department of the major military region and the General Cadre Management Department of the Military Commission.

　　(3) The scope of registration for transferred military cadres is tentatively set as those transferred after January 1949. In order to facilitate the registration work, the following provisions are now stipulated:

　　(1) The first-level departments directly under the Central People's Government system and the departments directly under the provincial and municipal level systems shall be responsible for investigation and registration by the General Cadre Management Department of the Military Commission in coordination with the Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government.

　　(2) The first-level departments directly under the major administrative region military and political committees and the Northeast People's Government, and the departments directly under their municipal-level systems, shall be responsible for investigation and registration by the cadre management department of the major military region in coordination with the military and political committee and the personnel department of the Northeast People's Government of each region.

　　(3) At all levels under the jurisdiction of the provincial people's governments, the cadre management department of each provincial military region shall be responsible for investigation and registration in coordination with the personnel departments under the provincial and municipal people's governments.

　　(4) In the future, if cadres who have undergone transfer registration are transferred, the agency that transfers the cadres shall be responsible for notifying the provincial military region, major military region cadre management department, or General Cadre Management Department of the Military Commission in the area where they are located for registration and record.

    （二）凡转业干部，必须填写军队转业干部登记表二份（表册另发），分存各所在区之省军区，或大军区干部管理部及军委总干部管理部。
    （三）军队转业干部登记范围，暂定为自一九四九年一月后转业者。为了便利登记工作之进行，兹规定：

    （２）各大行政区军政委员会，及东北人民政府直属一级系统各部门及其直属市级系统各部门，由各大军区干部管理部协同各该区军政委员会及东北人民政府人事部门负责调查登记。
