The Progress of Sino-Soviet Friendship in the Past Year
　　Shi Liang
    The victory of the Chinese revolution is inseparable from the sympathy and help of the Soviet Union. As Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "If there were no Soviet Union, if there were no victory of the anti-fascist Second World War, if Japanese imperialism had not been defeated, if no new democratic countries had emerged, if the oppressed nations in the East were not rising up to fight, if there were no struggles between the masses of people and the reactionary rulers in capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan, if there were no synthesis of all these factors, then the international reactionary forces pressing down on us would inevitably be many times greater than they are now. In this situation, could we have achieved victory? Obviously not. Even if we had won, it would have been impossible to consolidate it." Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, we leaned to one side. The All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was established under this correct one-sided instruction and has now been one year.
    Looking back on the progress of Sino-Soviet friendship in the past year, we feel infinitely excited: The Central People's Government was established, and the first to recognize us was the Soviet Union. Then, on February 14 of this year, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance was signed. It provides great assistance to our peaceful construction and economic prosperity and consolidates the peace in the Far East and the democratic camp of world peace. The signing of the agreement to develop rare and non-ferrous metals and oil mines in Xinjiang Province provides a bright prospect for the development of heavy industry in New China. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Navigation Agreement helps us develop air transport. In the Security Council, in order to support the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek gang's representatives and our request to send representatives to attend, from withdrawing from the Security Council to resuming the presidency on August 1, and recently our protest against US imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and our protest against the US Air Force's atrocities against our Northeast have all received the support and solidarity of the Soviet representative to the Security Council. All this makes it very clear: who are our friends in international diplomacy and in the sacred cause of defending world peace? Who are our enemies? It can further prove the correctness of Chairman Mao's one-sided instructions.
    In a short period of one year, our New China, due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party, the unity and cooperation of the democratic parties, people's organizations, and nationalities, and hard work, has achieved brilliant victories and achievements in military, political, economic, cultural, and educational fields. In order to consolidate our gains, we must strengthen our ties with our Soviet friends, exchange culture between the two countries, and increase mutual understanding under the correct instructions of Chairman Mao, so that the masses of the people of the two great countries can unite as one, and let the warmongers of the aggressive camp tremble before our people, and guarantee lasting world peace. We must also learn more from our Soviet friends and absorb the advanced experience of Soviet national construction, so that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we can steadily move from a new democratic society to a socialist society.

　　一年来中苏友谊的进展
    史良
    中国革命的胜利，和苏联的同情与帮助是分不开的，正如毛主席论人民民主专政里所指示：“假如没有苏联的存在，假如没有反法西斯的第二次世界大战的胜利，假如没有打倒日本帝国主义，假如没有各新民主国家的出现，假如没有东方各被压迫民族正在起来斗争，假如没有美国、英国、法国、德国、意大利、日本等等资本主义国家内部的人民大众和统治他们反动派之间的斗争，假如没有这一切的综合，那末，堆在我们头上的国际反动势力必定比现在不知要大多少倍，在这种情形下，我们能胜利么？显然是不能的。胜利了，要巩固，也不可能。”在毛主席的正确领导下，我们一面倒，中苏友好协会总会是在这一面倒正确指示下成立的，到现在已一周年了。
    回顾一年来中苏友谊的进展，我们感到无限的兴奋：中央人民政府成立，首先承认我们的是苏联。接着在本年二月十四日，签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约。对我们的和平建设与经济繁荣方面，给予很大的助力，并巩固了远东和平与世界和平民主阵营。签订开发新疆省稀有金属和有色金属及石油矿的协定，使新中国发展重工业有了美好的远景。签订中苏通航协定，帮助我们发展航空运输事业。在安理会方面，为了支持驱逐蒋匪帮代表和我方要求派代表出席，从退出安理会到八月一日的重返安理会执行主席职务，最近我们抗议美帝侵略台湾和抗议美帝空军对我东北的暴行，都得到安理会苏联代表的支持和声援，这一切，可以很明白的认识到：在国际外交方面，在保卫世界和平的神圣事业方面，谁是我们的朋友？谁是我们的敌人？更可证明毛主席一面倒指示的正确。
    在一年的短时期内，我们新中国，由于共产党的正确领导，各民主党派、各人民团体、各民族的团结合作艰苦奋斗，已在军事、政治、经济、文化、教育各方面，获得了辉煌的胜利和成就，为了巩固我们的收获，更要在毛主席一面倒的正确指示下，加强我们和苏联朋友的联系，交流两国间的文化，增进彼此间的了解，使两大国的人民群众，打成一片，让侵略阵营的战争贩子们在我们人民面前发抖，保障世界的持久和平。我们并要多多向苏联朋友学习，吸取苏联建国的先进经验，好在毛主席领导下，稳步地由新民主主义社会跨进社会主义社会。
