Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 10th: TASS, New York, October 10th – The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began discussing the second item on its agenda on October 9th, entitled "Uniting for Peace."

The first speaker was Dulles, a member of the US delegation, who presented a "joint" proposal on behalf of seven countries – Canada, France, the Philippines, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay – the various recommendations of which had been clarified by US Secretary of State Acheson in his speech to the General Assembly plenary session. The main points of this proposal are as follows:

If the Security Council, "because of the lack of unanimity among the permanent members of the Security Council," fails to exercise its power in maintaining international peace and security, and if the General Assembly is not in session at that time, then whenever peace is threatened, peace is breached, or an act of aggression occurs, the General Assembly must be convened within twenty-four hours at the request of any seven members of the Security Council to immediately discuss the situation and make appropriate recommendations regarding collective measures to the members of the United Nations, including the use of armed forces if necessary, in order to maintain or restore peace and security. The proposal also stipulates the establishment of a committee composed of nine to fourteen members to examine the maintenance of peace. According to Dulles's explanation, these members should be representatives of small countries. This committee should conduct investigations and report to the General Assembly or the so-called Interim Committee of the General Assembly (i.e., the illegal small General Assembly) on the situation in any area where there are tense international situations. The General Assembly and the Interim Committee of the General Assembly can utilize this committee when "the Security Council cannot fulfill the functions entrusted to it by the Charter."

Another provision of the proposal stipulates that the member states of the United Nations should maintain some forces within their own armed forces to serve as United Nations armed forces at the suggestion of the Security Council or the General Assembly. The proposal also suggests the establishment of a group of military experts who can provide advice on the training of the aforementioned forces "at the request of the member states of the United Nations." Finally, the proposal stipulates the establishment of a Collective Action Committee to study the methods and means of the member states of the United Nations for maintaining international peace and security.

In his speech, Dulles praised the illegal actions of the United States in Korea. However, he pointed out that the decisions of some members of the Security Council on the Korean issue were adopted in the absence of one of the permanent members of the Security Council, which in fact is an admission of the illegality of these actions. Dulles again made a routine attack on the principle of great power unanimity in the Security Council. He further said that the Korean War exposed the weakness of the United Nations, which must be urgently corrected. At the same time, the American representative indirectly expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that other countries had only sent very few troops to participate in the military operations in Korea.

When mentioning the reasons for the above proposal, Dulles attempted to prove that this proposal does not violate the United Nations Charter. But at the same time, he had to admit that some points of this proposal may cause people to have doubts.

Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky made a brief speech on this issue. Vyshinsky pointed out the situation: the seven-nation proposal and the previous speech by US Secretary of State Acheson at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly both contain four points, which are called "Uniting for Peace." Vyshinsky declared that the Soviet delegation agreed with some points of this proposal, and on the other hand, he would propose revisions and objections to other points. Proceeding from the above premise and wishing to focus attention on the main issues, Vyshinsky proposed that each of the four points of the proposal by the United States and the other six countries should be discussed separately.

Vyshinsky explained the reason for his suggestion by saying: We need to focus our attention on and discuss these four main points that have been clarified here, so that the issue can be fully understood and the greatest possible mutual understanding can be achieved. He further said: I suggest that these points should not be buried in a large pile of various issues that are often caused by the so-called general discussion, but each of these most important points should be discussed specifically and seriously.

Vyshinsky explained that if anyone wishes to express his general considerations during the discussion, he can do so when discussing any paragraph.

Vyshinsky continued: "Naturally, we can also choose the method we often use, but, in my opinion, doing so will be more convenient in practice and will make this complicated issue clearer. As someone has already mentioned before I spoke, this issue, although undoubtedly the case in some situations, raises doubts in many situations, and it will be more convenient to take this approach."

After a brief discussion of the Soviet proposal, the committee decided to adopt the procedure proposed by the committee chairman, namely: first, conduct a general discussion on the seven-nation proposal, and then conduct a point-by-point discussion of the proposal.

British representative Younger was the first speaker in the general discussion. Like the American representative, he tried his best to defend the legitimacy of the proposal, insisting that it was based on the principles of the United Nations. Younger further claimed that the principle of great power unanimity in the Security Council prevents the Security Council from normally exercising its functions. The British representative claimed that adopting the American proposal would strengthen collective security.

The last speaker at the morning session was Chilean representative Santa Cruz, who declared that the proposal put forward by his delegation and the proposal put forward by the United States and the other six countries were for the same purpose and mission. As previously reported, the proposal stipulates that the member states of the United Nations sign a convention according to which they will assume many obligations, including fulfilling the important resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations regarding supporting peace and security.

The morning session adjourned after the Chilean representative spoke.

At the afternoon session, representatives from Turkey, Uruguay, Greece, the Philippines, and Belgium repeated the arguments of Dulles and Younger at the meeting to support the American proposal.

The last speaker was French representative Schuman, who said that France considers itself one of the initiators of this proposal.

　　联大政治委员会讨论七国“联合”提案
    苏联建议提案四点应分别讨论
    杜勒斯演说又企图破坏安理会大国一致原则
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社纽约十日讯：联合国大会政治委员会十月九日开始讨论议程上的第二个议案，名为“为和平而统一行动”。
    第一个发言人为美国代表团团员杜勒斯，他代表七个国家——加拿大、法国、菲律宾、土耳其、英国、美国及乌拉圭——提出一个“联合”提案，其中的各项建议都已由美国国务卿艾奇逊在大会全体会议发言时加以阐明。这个提案的要点如下：
    如果安理会“由于安理会各常任理事国间缺乏一致意见”，不能在维护国际和平与安全方面行使其权力，又如果大会当时未举行会议，则凡在和平受到威胁、和平遭到破坏或发生侵略行动时，在安理会任何七个理事国提出要求的二十四小时以内，必须召开大会，立即讨论发生的局势，以向联合国会员国提出关于集体措施的相应建议，必要时并得使用武装部队，以便维持或恢复和平与安全。这个提案并规定成立一个由九名至十四名委员组成的委员会，考察和平的维持。据杜勒斯解释，这些委员应为小国的代表。这个委员会应进行考察并向大会或所谓大会临时委员会（即非法的小型联大）报告有紧张国际局势的任何地区的情况。大会及大会临时委员会遇“安理会不能完成宪章赋予它的职权时”，可以利用这个委员会。
    提案另一条规定联合国各会员国应在本国武装部队中维持一些部队，以便应安理会或大会的建议而充作联合国武装部队。提案并提议成立军事专家团，这些专家得“应联合国会员国的要求”而在训练上述部队方面提供意见。最后，提案规定成立一个集体行动委员会，来为维护国际和平与安全而研究联合国会员国的办法与手段。
    杜勒斯在演说中盛赞美国在朝鲜的非法行为。但是他指出：安理会一些理事国关于朝鲜问题的决定，是在安理会常任理事国之一未出席的情况下通过的，这事实上就是承认了这些行动的非法。杜勒斯再次对安理会中大国一致的原则作例行的攻击。他进一步说：朝鲜战争暴露了联合国的弱点，这个弱点必须迫切地加以纠正。同时，这个美国代表对于其他国家只派遣非常少的军队去参加朝鲜的军事行动一事，间接地表示了不满。
    杜勒斯在提到上述提案的理由时企图证明：这个提案并不违反联合国宪章。但是同时他不得不承认：这个提案的某些点可能会引起人们的怀疑。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基就这个问题发表简短的演说。维辛斯基指出这种情况：七国提案和美国国务卿艾奇逊前次在联合国大会全体会议上的演说，都包含四点内容，这四点就被叫作“为和平而统一行动”。维辛斯基宣称：苏联代表团同意这个提案的某些点，另一方面，他对其他几点要提出修正和反对。从上述前提出发，并愿集中注意于主要问题。维辛斯基提议：美国和其他六国的四点提案每一点应分别加以讨论。
    维辛斯基解释他这个建议的理由说：我们有必要来集中注意并讨论这四个已在这里被阐明的主要论点，以便使问题能充分明白，并能取得最大可能的相互谅解，他进一步说：我建议不应该使这几点埋没在所谓一般讨论时经常引起的一大堆各式各样的问题中，而对每一个这种最重要的论点，都应加以具体和认真的讨论。
    维辛斯基说明：如果在讨论时，任何人愿意表示他一般的考虑，那么他在讨论任何一段的时候都可以这样作。
    维辛斯基接着说：“自然，也可以选择我们经常使用的方法，但是，据我看来，这样做会在实际上更加便利，会使这个错综复杂的问题更加明白。正如在我说话以前就有人已提到的那样，这个问题虽然在有些情形下勿庸怀疑，但是却在许多情形下引起人们怀疑，采取这种方法会更加便利。”
    委员会在稍事讨论苏联提议以后，决定采纳委员会主席所提出的程序，即：首先对七国提案进行一般讨论，然后对提案进行逐点讨论。
    英国代表杨格是一般讨论中的第一个发言人。他和美国代表一样竭力为提案的合法性辩护，硬说这个提案是以联合国的原则为根据的。杨格进一步声称：安理会的大国一致原则妨碍安理会正常地行使职权。英国代表称：采纳美国的提案将加强集体安全。
    上午会议的最后一个发言人是智利代表圣大克鲁兹，他宣称：他的代表团所提出的提案以及美国和其他六国所提出的提案，是为了达成同一目的和任务。如前所报道该提案规定联合国会员国签订一项公约，按照这个公约，它们将承担许多义务，包括履行安理会和联合国大会关于支持和平及安全的重要决议的义务在内。
    上午会议在智利代表发言后，即行休会。
    在下午会议上，土耳其、乌拉圭、希腊、菲律宾和比利时代表把杜勒斯和杨格的论调重复在会上说了一遍，以支持美国提案。
    最后一个发言的是法国代表舒曼，他说：法国认为它自己是这个提案的发起人之一。
