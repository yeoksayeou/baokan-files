　　New Book Introductions
  *Labor Bulletin* Fourth Issue
    The fourth issue of *Labor Bulletin* was published on the 17th of this month. This issue focuses on the relevant documents of the "Conference of Representatives of Combat Heroes and Model Workers," and combines the "Decision of the Government Administration Council on Rewarding Inventions, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals Related to Production" with the two laws, "Provisional Regulations on Protecting Invention Rights and Patent Rights," pointing out that heroes and model workers will achieve greater successes in national defense construction and economic construction in the future. In response to the important tasks of protecting labor and providing relief to unemployed workers, this journal publishes two investigation reports, "Shenyang Smelting Plant" and "Qingdao No. 2 and No. 8 Textile Factories," as well as the "Summary Report on Labor Protection Work in Northeast China" and "Summary and Opinions of the Henan Provincial Labor Bureau on the Work of Providing Relief to Unemployed Workers," explaining the specific methods of "protecting labor" and "providing relief to unemployed workers." This issue also contains "Typical Introductions of Several Labor-Management Consultation Meetings," "Summary Report on Labor-Management Relations in Private Enterprises in Northeast China," and "Achievements and Experiences in Establishing Labor-Management Consultation Meetings in Wuhan in the Past Four Months," proving that the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings is one of the important factors for the improvement of industry and commerce.
  *Translation Bulletin* Fourth Issue
    The fourth issue of *Translation Bulletin* was published on the 15th of this month. In order to celebrate National Day and commemorate Mr. Lu Xun, this issue has been expanded to seventy-two pages, totaling about 140,000 words. In the Theory and Experience section, Dong Qiushi's article, "The Standards and Focus of Translation Criticism," focuses on current translation criticism, emphasizing that "our criticism should be constructive and typical, not criticism for the sake of criticism," and therefore "our translation community should also have professional translation critics." Hu Zhongchi's "On Lu Xun's Translation" is an original and important paper to commemorate the 14th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death. In terms of book reviews, there is Luo Shusi's "On the Chinese Translation of *Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism*," Zhao Shaohou's "The Chinese Translation of *History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course*," Zhao Lisheng's "A Brief Review of Ke's Translation of *The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte*," Liu Qun's "On Marxism in Linguistics," Huang Fei's "Review of Xue's Translation of *General Chemistry*," and Li Lu's "On Lei Ran's Translation of *The Real Man* (with reply)." There are four papers specifically discussing translation problems and translation experiences by Liu Sixun, Lei Haizong, etc. The "Translation Short Essays" include ten works by Yang Yanqiu, Liu Liaoyi, etc. This issue also includes the Russian-Chinese comparison article "Sanctions Against American Interventionists," translated by Chen Bingyi. In addition, there are discussions on unified translation names, including important terms in the legal field. Translation community dynamics, translation news, translation plans, translation work panel discussions, mailboxes, and other items specifically reflect the recent situation of the national translation community. This issue is still not for sale, and translators from all over are welcome to request and submit contributions.
