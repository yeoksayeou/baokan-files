　　Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Established for One Year
    Membership Nears 200,000
    Sino-Soviet Friendship Activities Organized and Launched
    [Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, since its establishment on October 9th of last year, has established 826 branch associations by the end of September, with a total of 195,663 members. Among the members, workers account for 28.8 percent, students account for 20.7 percent, staff account for 19.6 percent, and farmers account for 11.1 percent.
    Over the past year, the work of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association can be roughly divided into two stages. The first stage was before February of this year, with the focus on developing membership and establishing organizations. After February, it was clearly proposed to focus on members, carry out branch work, and center on propaganda and education work. Due to the close combination of organizational work and propaganda and education work, Sino-Soviet friendship has become a mass activity, and branch work has begun to penetrate into the masses of members. For example, in February, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, in conjunction with the universal study movement of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, not only strengthened members' understanding of the brotherly relationship between China and the Soviet Union, but also developed 50,000 new members during the movement.
    In order to promote propaganda and education services, the City Friendship Association began in April by first organizing 88 school branch associations into 19 service stations, and organizing the branch associations under the 16 district general branch associations into 16 service stations according to system regions. Then, activities such as movies, pictures, and lectures were launched through service stations. In this way, branch propaganda and education activities gradually transitioned from a scattered and unplanned state to an organized and leadership-driven state.
    Specific work includes: screening movies, picture exhibitions, lectures, publishing books and periodicals, broadcasting Russian language lectures, library reading, "Sino-Soviet Friendship Voice" broadcasting, and promoting the peace signature movement. Each work has been welcomed by the majority of citizens. According to statistics, 520 movies were screened, with a total audience of more than 600,000 people; the first phase of Russian language lectures had more than 2,400 graduates; the small reading rooms of 31 branch associations had an average of more than 2,100 people visiting each day. The City Friendship Association also joined forces with various people's organizations in Beijing to launch the Beijing Peace Signature Movement. The signature work led by the general branch associations of the Friendship Association in each district, in the nine districts within the city alone, had more than 800,000 people signing the peace declaration. Over the past year, the smooth development of these many tasks has specifically demonstrated the concern of the people of Beijing for Sino-Soviet friendship.

　　京市中苏友协成立一年
    会员已近二十万人
    中苏友好活动有组织地展开
    【本报讯】北京市中苏友好协会自去年十月九日成立一年来，截至九月底止，已建立支会八百二十六个，共有会员十九万五千六百六十三名。会员中，工人成份占百分之二十八点八，学生占百分之二十点七，职员占百分之十九点六，农民占百分之十一点一。
    一年来，北京市中苏友好协会的工作大致可分为两个阶段。今年二月以前是第一阶段，工作着重在发展会员和建立组织；二月之后，明确地提出了面向会员，开展支会工作，并以宣教工作为中心。由于组织工作与宣教工作的密切结合，中苏友好成了群众性的活动，支会工作开始深入到会员群众中去。如二月间，北京市中苏友协结合着普遍学习中苏友好同盟互助条约的运动，不仅加强了会员对中苏两国兄弟般的关系的认识，而且在运动中发展了新会员五万人。
    为了推动宣教服务工作，市友协从四月份开始，首先把八十八个学校支会组织成十九个服务站，把十六个区总支会所属的支会，按系统地域组成了十六个服务站。然后，通过服务站展开了电影、图片、讲演等活动。这样，使支会宣教等活动由零星无计划的状态，逐渐进入到有组织、有领导的地步。
    具体的工作有：放映电影、图片展览、讲演会、出版书刊、广播俄语讲座、图书阅览、“中苏友声”广播、以及推动和平签名运动等。每一项工作都受到广大市民的欢迎。据统计，放映了五百二十场电影，共有观众六十余万人；广播俄语讲座的第一期毕业听众就有二千四百多人；三十一个支会的小型阅览室，每天平均有二千一百多人前往阅览。市友协并曾联合京市各人民团体发动北京市的和平签名运动。各区友协总支会领导的签名工作，只城内九个区就有八十余万人在和平宣言上签了名。一年来，这许多工作的顺利开展，也就具体地表现了北京市人民对于中苏友好的关切。
