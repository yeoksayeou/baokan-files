Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 20th: The Administrative Committee of the Miners' Trade Unions International, one of the industrial departments of the World Federation of Trade Unions, held a meeting in Budapest from the 10th to the 14th. Representatives from miners' unions of thirteen countries, including the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, France, Sweden, and Belgium, attended the meeting.

The meeting heard a report by Soviet representative Sherashin on "The Activities and Tasks of the Miners' Trade Unions International in the Struggle to Defend Peace," and adopted a resolution on this report, calling on miners around the world to fight resolutely for the prohibition of atomic weapons, the reduction and control of armaments, and against preparations for new wars. The resolution also guaranteed full support for all miners' unions engaged in opposing aggression and colonial wars, whether or not they have joined the Miners' Trade Unions International.

The meeting heard reports by Ma De on "The Activities and Tasks of Miners' Trade Unions" and Duller on "The Crisis in the Mining Industry in Capitalist Countries," and discussed the two reports. The speakers from both reports, as well as representatives from Belgian and West German miners, cited facts to illustrate that miners in capitalist countries such as France and Italy, as well as in colonial countries such as Nigeria and North Africa, are waging an increasingly broad struggle to defend peace and their own rights. French miners are enthusiastically responding to the slogan put forward by Duclos: "Not to produce even one centimeter of fuel or metal for imperialist wars."

The speeches of the representatives of Poland and Czechoslovakia illustrated the gradual improvement of the lives of miners and the increasing improvement of mining production in the two countries. This is in stark contrast to the situation in capitalist countries.

On the 11th, the meeting passed a resolution protesting against the American armed aggression against Korea and demanding that the US military withdraw from Korea to ensure peace.
