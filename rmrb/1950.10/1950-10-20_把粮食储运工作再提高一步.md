　　Take Grain Storage and Transportation to the Next Level
　　Liang Zhu Hang
　　In the past year, the largest portion of the national agricultural tax grain has been used for rations; the second largest portion has been used to supply cities to stabilize prices; and the third largest portion has been used for public services, especially for water conservancy and social relief. In addition to the above three items, there is still a slight surplus.
　　Due to victories in military, political, and economic aspects, the allocation of public grain in the next year will also undergo significant changes. In addition to rations, public service grain, supplying cities, and adjusting grain in disaster areas, a large portion will be used as national strategic grain reserves to take care of shortages and other needs. This is, on the one hand, one of the results of our country's victories in all aspects over the past year, and on the other hand, an important regulatory measure that the country should take during a bumper harvest to avoid "low grain prices hurting farmers."
　　Due to changes in the objective situation, grain storage and transportation work also needs to be improved accordingly. The specific tasks are as follows:
　　(1) Change the Transportation Method
　　In terms of transportation, when the War of Liberation was still in full swing, the biggest task of grain work was to ensure supply. In order to supply military needs, a large amount of grain was transported to the front lines regardless of cost, and a large-scale compulsory mobilization system was adopted. Therefore, grain losses and transportation costs were very high, accounting for 10% to 30% of the total grain amount, or even more. With the change of the situation, the first thing to do is to change the compulsory mobilization system. Except for the 50-li free transportation stipulated by the state when grain is put into storage, and 100-li free transportation in special areas, other transportation should be compensated at market prices. The result of implementing this over the past year is that both public and private transportation agencies and the working people welcome it, and the transportation cost is actually less than that of the compulsory mobilization system. Therefore, we have learned from experience that, in addition to the free transportation for putting grain into storage, we should resolutely adopt the method of hiring laborers, and take into account the interests of both parties. In this way, after economic accounting, improving transportation organization and receiving methods, efficiency will be further improved. In the process of grain transportation and concentration, we must especially point out that before receiving and putting grain into storage, a large number of temporary storage warehouses must be quickly set up to facilitate the delivery of grain by the masses and to facilitate the organization of transportation. The principle for setting them up is that the distance between storage warehouses should generally not exceed 100 li, to comply with the regulations for 50-li free transportation. It would be more appropriate if the grain-delivering masses can make a round trip within one day. At present, the autumn grain collection work is about to begin on a large scale, and 70 to 80 million households across the country will simultaneously send grain over long distances. This is an extremely arduous organizational task. If it is not planned properly and deployed quickly, it will increase confusion and lead to accidents. Experience has proved that the method of short-distance entry into storage, followed by concentration in storage warehouses, is relatively easy to organize and does not increase expenses.
　　(2) Increase the Construction of New Warehouses
　　The shortage of warehouses and poor equipment is an urgent problem to be solved in the current grain storage work. According to statistics, the total warehouse capacity in the country (excluding Northeast China) is only more than 2 billion jin, and most of them are not suitable. Therefore, 90% of the public grain has to be stored in civilian houses, temples, ancestral halls, and open-air warehouses. In the past, public grain was collected and used immediately, so the problem was not prominent. In the future, the situation will change, and a large amount of grain will be concentrated and stored for a long time. Moreover, the varieties, moisture content, and ash content of the grain delivered by the masses are difficult to standardize in a short period of time. Therefore, if new warehouses are not built and the equipment of existing warehouses is not improved, the phenomena of grain heating, insect infestation, and mold will become increasingly serious.
　　The state will allocate a special fund to increase the construction of warehouses. However, because we do not yet have a mature experience in building warehouses, the agencies responsible for the specific work must proceed from reality and carry out the work carefully and step by step in accordance with the guidelines for grain warehouse construction. In general, the following should be noted:
　　(1) Expand Warehouse Capacity: The construction of grain warehouses is different from the requirements of general houses, and it is also different from the requirements of general warehouses. First of all, we should pay attention to expanding the warehouse capacity as much as possible. Therefore, the construction cost of housing, offices, and other auxiliary buildings should not exceed 5% of the total construction cost as the standard.
　　(2) Be Strong and Durable: Therefore, the selection of materials, the location of the warehouse, the site, the geology, the waterway, especially the construction of the warehouse foundation, must be given the most meticulous survey and research.
　　(3) Reduce Expenditure: The larger the warehouse capacity and the better the building materials, the higher the construction cost will naturally be, which is not uneconomical; but sometimes spending more money does not necessarily result in a good warehouse. According to reports from various places, the construction cost of some warehouses is more than 40% of the value of the grain storage capacity, while some are less than 20%, and the function of the warehouse is actually inferior in some cases. This is worth vigilance.
　　(4) The design of the warehouse should be determined according to the actual situation: We should use local materials and adapt to local conditions. We should emphasize taking care of local financial resources, material resources, and technical conditions, and adopt more folk forms, such as cave dwellings in the Northwest, warehouses in the Yellow River Basin, and bamboo and wood barns in the Yangtze River Basin. We cannot blindly indulge in modernization. In terms of structure, we should consciously pay attention to the performance of ventilation and airtightness, and have facilities for heat prevention, moisture prevention, insect prevention, rat prevention, bird prevention, fire prevention, water prevention, and theft prevention. Ventilation and moisture prevention should be especially noted in South China.
　　(5) The construction method can be self-construction, entrusted construction, or contracting. It should also be selected according to the subjective and objective conditions. If it is self-built, the engineering personnel should be carefully selected. If it is entrusted or contracted, the contractor's ability and credit must be thoroughly investigated in advance. Regardless of the construction method, we should generally pay attention to strengthening supervision and preventing the bad habit of cutting corners. It should be pointed out that, regardless of whether it is self-built or contracted, the act of cutting corners is a criminal act in national construction, which must be consciously stopped. Otherwise, in addition to being liable for compensation under the contract, legal liability should also be borne.
　　In short, grain management agencies at all levels should regard warehouse construction as a major event, and should be conscientious and conduct it in accordance with the principles of economic accounting and applicability. They must not be careless, resulting in waste of national financial and material resources.
　　(3) Improve the Equipment of Existing Warehouses
　　In addition to increasing the construction of new warehouses, it is also very necessary to improve the equipment of existing warehouses. This year, insect pests have been generally found in warehouses in various places. In severe cases, at least 2% to 3% is lost, and some individual warehouses have lost 30%. This is the result of not having insect prevention equipment. Moreover, some warehouses do not pay attention to bird prevention, and most warehouses have not yet come up with effective ways to prevent warehouse rats and termites. This loss is very serious. Especially because it is a loss of quality, it is usually not easily detected, and when a large amount is discovered, it seems helpless. In the past, some people estimated that if no attention is paid to prevention and control after grain enters the warehouse, then the actual loss may be equal to the total amount of foreign grain imported during the Kuomintang reactionary government era. Now it seems that this is not without basis. This grain conference has taken a series of measures in this regard, such as collecting raw grain (grain with skin); calling on the masses to deliver dry and clean grain; conducting standard inspections based on the actual grain situation in the local area that year; stipulating that grain should be exposed to the sun, ventilated, and dried after entering the warehouse; and stipulating that after passing the inspection, if the total amount of grain is indeed reduced in order to reduce the moisture and ash content of the grain, registration is allowed. This can reverse the past idea of being afraid of grain loss and not being able to get reimbursement and dare not expose it to the sun for ventilation (but it must be noted that this must not allow corrupt people to take advantage of loopholes). In addition, it is also stipulated that warehouses should be equipped with bird-proof nets, raise cats, add rat traps, stipulate a regular door and window opening and closing system, pay attention to warehouse cleaning, use a large number of scientific medicines and equipment, establish inspection and prevention and control agencies, organize a control network, and combine with academic institutions to open training courses to prepare forces for sudden rescue. These methods are all necessary, need to be resolutely promoted, and continue to be studied and developed.
　　(4) Improve Professional Knowledge and Correct Work Deviations
　　In the past year, among the losses of public grain, in addition to the part looted by bandits and special agents in the newly liberated areas, the storage loss was about 81.1 million jin. Under adverse objective conditions, this number is still very difficult to achieve. It is a concrete manifestation of the spirit of grain management comrades at all levels to cherish the property of the people and the country and overcome difficulties. Therefore, it should be said that our grain storage work has achieved results. However, there are still the following non-negligible shortcomings and deviations that must be corrected.
　　(1) Lack of Scientific Storage Knowledge: Because the country's public grain needs to be concentrated and stored for a long time at present and in the future, grain storage has become a specialized business. Simple past experience is definitely not enough. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize experience from practical work, study scientific management methods hard, and absorb mature experience in grain management at home and abroad in order to promote and improve this work. In the past, this point was not clearly stated or loud enough. Some comrades are not content with grain work, and the leadership is responsible for this.
　　(2) Being Penny Wise and Pound Foolish in Calculation: This is not only reflected in the allocation of funds, but also in the allocation of personnel and even the storage policy. Because in the past, we did not know the standards and could not find the rules, the financial calculation may have been biased, which caused difficulties in the work and increased unnecessary losses. Some people reflect that "saving salt blinds the sauce" and "picking up sesame seeds and losing watermelons." This is worthy of review and must be corrected, which is not difficult to correct; but the main problem is still to determine the standards, master the rules, and be familiar with the situation, so as to ensure the work on the one hand and implement the spirit of the economic accounting system on the other hand, so as not to cause waste and abuse of expenses.
　　(3) More Criticism than Encouragement for Lower-Level Cadres: Due to the existence of accidents such as grain heating, insect infestation, mold, theft, corruption, and embezzlement, the leadership is blamed by public opinion. Starting from the responsibility, it is inevitable to be anxious, so various measures are taken to prevent it. As a result, most of the grain is difficult to preserve, but sometimes because more punishment measures are taken, some cadres with less methods and weaker politics quite universally exist with the ideas of "fear of beheading," "fear of going to jail," and "fear of being punished." The leading organs should be responsible for this. In the future, the leading organs should understand the situation more, strengthen guidance, assist in solving the difficulties of the lower levels, encourage their spirit of actively taking responsibility, correct their mistakes in a timely manner, and strictly distinguish between the subjective problems of criminal behavior and objective difficulties, so as to promote the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the cadres.
　　(4) Non-Uniform Staffing, Inappropriate Division of Labor, and Bureaucratic and Administrative Style: Staffing and division of labor were not done well in the past. Now a draft of the provisional organizational regulations for national public grain management agencies has been formulated, and there are new algorithms for fixed personnel and quotas. Once approved by the State Council, it can be announced and implemented, and the past mistakes can be gradually corrected. After a preliminary review of bureaucracy and administrative work, we should pay close attention and resolutely overcome the past problem of being busy with office affairs and not going deep into actual work. We must make cadres go down to the lower levels step by step, face the warehouses, and pay more attention to the situation of rural warehouses. This is very necessary and must be done. In addition, we should also pay attention to implementing the system of personal responsibility, stipulating detailed work rules, strictly implementing the performance appraisal system, and launching a model creation campaign to further promote the creativity and enthusiasm of lower-level cadres.

　　把粮食储运工作再提高一步
    梁竹航
    一年来国家公粮的支配，最大部分是口粮；其次是用于供应城市稳定物价的粮食；第三是事业用粮，其中尤以用于水利与社会救济者为最多。除以上三项以外，仍略有剩余。
    由于军事、政治、经济各方面的胜利，下年度公粮支配情况亦将有显著改变。即除了口粮、事业粮供应城市和调剂灾区的粮食以外，有大部分作为国家总储备粮，以照顾荒歉和其他需要。这，一方面是我们国家一年来在各方面胜利的成果之一，另一方面也是国家在丰收的时候为了免除“谷贱伤农”所应该采取的重要的调节措施。
    由于客观形势的变动，粮食储运工作，也需要随之更提高一步，其具体工作，有下列几项。
    （一）改变调运办法
    在调运方面，当解放战争尚在大规模进行的时候，粮食工作以保证供给为最大任务。为供应军事需要，大量粮食之运往前线是不计成本，而且是采取大规模义务动员制度的。因此粮食的损失和运费都很大，均占粮食数字的百分之十到三十，甚至还要多。随着情况的变动，首先便需要改变义务动员制，除粮食入仓时国家规定的五十里义运，特殊地区一百里义运外，其他均应采取照市价给资的办法。一年来这样执行的结果，公私运输机关和劳动人民都是欢迎的，而且运费支出反比义务动员制为少。因此我们得出经验：除入仓义运外，应该坚决采用雇脚的办法，并应兼顾双方利益。这样再经过经济核算、改善运输组织和接运办法，其效率当更会提高。在粮食运输、集中的过程上，我们要特别指出：接收入仓之前，必须迅速设置大量的临时收纳仓库，以便利群众送粮，便利组织运输。其设置原则，即收纳仓库相互间的距离一般应不超过一百里，以符合五十里义运的规定，如果能使送粮群众在一天之内来回，则更妥善。目前秋征工作即将大规模开始，全国七八千万户的交粮人民，将同时出动作远距离的送粮。这是一件极繁重的组织工作，如不计划妥善，迅速布置，是会增加混乱，酿成事故的。经验证明短距离入仓之后，再由收纳仓库集中的办法，是比较容易组织而且不会增多开支的。
    （二）增建新库
    仓库少，设备差，是当前粮食储存工作上一个极待解决的问题。据统计全国（东北除外）仅有二十多亿斤容量的仓库，大部分且不适用，因此十分之九的公粮要储存在民房、庙宇、祠堂和露天仓囤中，过去公粮随征随用，问题还不显得突出，今后情况转变，粮食要大量集中，长期保管，而群众交来的粮食，品种、水份与灰杂等，短期间又难求标准化，所以如果不增建新仓与改善现有仓库的设备，则粮食发热、生虫、发霉等现象必将日趋严重。
    国家为了增建仓库，将特别拿出一笔经费来进行。可是因为我们还没有一套成熟的建仓经验，故负具体责任的机关必须从实际出发，按照粮食仓库建设方针，慎重的、有步骤的去做，一般应注意：
    （一）要扩大仓容：粮仓的建筑，与一般房屋的要求不同，与一般仓房的要求亦不同，首先便应该注意尽可能的扩大仓容，因此住房、办公室及其他附属建筑的建造费，以不超过总建造费的百分之五为标准。
    （二）要坚固耐久：因此工料的选择，仓库位置、地盘、地质、水路、特别是仓基的构造，均须予以最缜密的勘察和研究。
    （三）要减省支出：仓库容量大，建筑材料好，建造费用自然要高，这并不是不合算的；但有时花钱多，却不一定能造出好仓。据各地反映，有的仓库，建造费用合仓容粮折价的百分之四十以上，有的只合百分之二十还不到，而仓库的功用，居然有些是前者不如后者。这是值得警惕的。
    （四）仓库设计应根据实际情况来决定：要就地取材，因地制宜，应该强调照顾当地财力、物力与技术条件，多采用民间的形式，如西北的窑洞，黄河流域的仓囤，长江流域多用竹木廒间等，不能盲目地醉心于现代化。构造方面要有意识地注意通风与密闭的性能，要有防热、防潮、防虫、防鼠、防雀、防火、防水与防盗的设备。华南地区尤其要注意通风与防潮。
    （五）营造方式，可采用自造、委托、或包工，亦应看主、客观条件来选择；假使是自己建造，应慎重选择工程人员，假使委托或包工，则事先必须详细调查承包者的能力与信用，且无论建造方式如何，一般都要注意加强监工与防止偷工减料的恶习。应指出无论自造与承造，偷工减料的行为都是国家建设中的罪恶行为，必须自觉地停止，否则除应按合同负赔偿责任外，并应负法律责任。
    总之，各级粮食管理机构，应该把建仓工作看成一件大事，应该兢兢业业，本着经济核算与适用的原则去进行，绝不能粗心大意，致浪费国家的财力物力。
    （三）改善现有仓库的设备
    除了增建新仓之外，改善现有仓库的设备也是非常必要的。今年各地仓库开始普遍的发现虫害，较为严重者最少的蚀去百分之二、三，个别仓库有蚀去百分之三十的，这就是没有防虫设备的结果。而且，有的仓库对于防雀不注意，大部仓库对于仓鼠和白蚁还没有想出有效制止的办法，这种损失是很严重的。特别由于它是质量上的损失，平常不易为人所发现，及至大量发现以后，又表现束手无策。过去有人估计，粮食进仓后，如果不注意防治，则其实际损失，可能等于国民党反动政府时代外粮进口的总数，现在看来不是没有根据的。此次粮食会议对这方面曾采取一系列的措施，如征收原粮（带皮粮）；号召群众交干交净；根据当地当年粮食实际情况，进行标准检查；粮食进仓之后规定要曝晒，要通风、干燥；并规定通过检查之后，如确实为了减除粮食的水份与灰杂而使粮食总量有所减少时，准予登记，这就可以扭转过去怕粮食损耗不能报销而不敢进行曝晒通风的思想（但必须注意不要因此而使贪污舞弊者有隙可乘）。此外又规定仓库要设置防雀网、养猫、添设捕鼠器，规定门窗定时启闭制度，要注意仓库清洁工作，大量使用科学药械，建立检验、防治机构，组织控制网，并与学术机关结合，开设训练班，准备力量，以便突击扑救。这些办法都是必要的，需要坚决推行并继续研究与发扬的。
    （四）提高业务知识，纠正工作偏向
    过去一年来公粮的损失，其中除在新解放区为匪特所抢掠的一部分以外，保管损失约有八千一百万斤稍强。在恶劣的客观条件下，这个数字也算是很不容易的，它是各级粮食管理同志爱护人民国家财产与克服困难精神的具体表现，因此，应该说我们的粮食保管工作是有成绩的。但仍有以下不可忽视的缺点和偏向，必须加以纠正。
    （１）缺少科学保管知识：由于国家的公粮在目前和今后已需要大量集中和长期储存，故粮食保管在目前已成了专门的业务，单靠过去简单的经验是绝不够用的，因此就必须从实际工作中总结经验，用功学习科学的管理方法，吸收中外管理粮食的成熟经验，才能将这一工作推进提高一步。过去这一点提的不够明确，也不够响亮，有些同志不安心于粮食工作，这在领导上是要负责的。
    （２）计算上的因小失大：这不仅表现在经费的分配上，而且也表现在人员的配备、甚至连保管的方针上。由于过去不知道标准，摸不着规律，在财政计算上可能偏了一些，因此造成了工作上的困难，增加了不必要的损失，有的反映说：“省了盐，瞎了酱”，“拣起芝麻，丢了西瓜”，这是值得检讨的，也是必须改正并不难改正的；但主要问题还在于确定标准，掌握规律，熟习情况，一方面保证工作，一方面贯彻经济核算制的精神，才不致发生浪费与滥支现象。
    （３）对于下层干部的批评多于鼓励：由于粮食发热、生虫、霉烂、偷盗、贪污、挪用等事故的存在，领导方面受舆论指责，从责任上出发，难免着急，因而采取各种措施，以谋防止，结果绝大部分的粮食难得保存，但有时因为多采取了一些处分办法，使办法少、政治弱的一些干部，相当普遍地存在了“怕杀头”、“怕坐大狱”、“怕受处分”的思想，这是领导机关应该负责的。今后领导机关应多了解情况，加强指导，协助解决下级的困难，鼓励其积极负责的精神，及时纠正其错误，并将犯罪行为上的主观问题与客观困难严格分别处理，这样才能发扬干部的积极性与责任感。
    （４）编制不划一、分工不适当与官僚主义事务主义的作风：编制与分工，过去并没有做好，现在已制定了全国公粮管理机构暂行组织规程草案，定员定额也有了新的算法，一俟政务院核准，即可公布实施，过去的错误当可逐步纠正。官僚主义事务主义既经初步检讨，即应严加注意，坚决克服过去忙于机关事务、不深入实际工作的毛病，务使干部逐级向下，面向仓库，以更大的注意力注意农村仓库的情况，这是十分必要而且必须这样做的。此外还要注意贯彻专人负责制，规定精细的工作守则，严格实行考绩制，开展创模运动，以进一步发挥下层干部的创造性和积极性。
