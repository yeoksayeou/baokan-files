　　Beijing Postal Branches Change Mail Delivery Times
    Due to the shortening days, and to avoid difficulties with evening mail delivery, Beijing's postal branches have, starting October 4th, moved the fourth delivery time for regular mail and registered mail forward by one hour. Ordinary letters mailed within the city that are dropped into mailboxes before 3:00 PM will be delivered the same day; those dropped in after 3:00 PM will be delivered on the first delivery run the next day.

　　京市各邮政支局变更投递邮件时间
    现因天气渐短，为了避免晚间投递邮件的困难，京市各邮政支局已自十月四日起，将平常邮件和挂号邮件的第四次投递时刻提前一小时，本市互寄的平信，在下午三点以前投进筒信箱的，都赶得上当天投递，下午三点以后投进的，次日第一班投出。
