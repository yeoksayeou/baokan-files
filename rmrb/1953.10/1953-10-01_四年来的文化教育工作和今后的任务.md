Four Years of Cultural and Educational Work and Future Tasks
By Guo Moruo, Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council

In the past four years, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the cultural and educational work of New China, in coordination with various social reform movements and economic recovery work, has made considerable achievements in restoration, reform, and development.

First, in education: Higher education nationwide has undergone initial rectification and reform, with significant development. More than 90 percent of teachers in higher education institutions have participated in ideological remolding studies. Three-quarters of higher education institutions have carried out departmental and specialization adjustments, and on this basis, have universally begun teaching reform, with significant improvements in teaching content, methods, organization, and systems. The old era's situation of complex departments and irrelevant learning has been fundamentally changed. Ordinary middle schools, secondary normal schools, and secondary technical schools have also undergone preliminary rectification and have seen significant development. Since the founding of New China, to cultivate new intellectuals from worker and peasant backgrounds, the Renmin University of China and dozens of worker-peasant rapid middle schools have been established. Currently, there are over 50 million primary school students nationwide, more than double the highest number of primary school students during the Kuomintang rule (1946). Teachers in various types of schools have generally participated in various social reforms and ideological remolding studies, and the content and methods of teaching have been preliminarily reformed. The level of students is gradually improving.

In the past four years, the education of workers and peasants and the work of eliminating illiteracy have also seen considerable development. First, in the People's Liberation Army, the rapid literacy method of Qi Jianhua was promoted, achieving great success. The work of eliminating illiteracy has also seen significant gains among worker and peasant cadres and industrial workers. Large numbers of workers participate in vocational spare-time schools, and tens of millions of farmers participate in winter schools and regular people's schools, many of whom have escaped illiteracy.

Second, in health and sports: First, a mass patriotic health campaign was launched, initially implementing the principle of prevention first and combining health work with mass movements, significantly reducing the prevalence of epidemics and achieving a great victory in crushing the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism. During the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, many volunteer medical surgery teams and health work teams were organized and sent to work on the Korean front. Hospitals, clinics, county health centers, district health stations, joint clinics, and various epidemic prevention institutions have seen significant development. Due to the implementation of universal epidemic prevention work, the incidence and mortality rates of the national population have decreased in recent years, especially the disease mortality of pregnant women and infants has been greatly reduced. The Central Ministry of Health has organized a large number of health workers to go to various minority areas to carry out prevention and treatment work, and has established medical institutions in minority areas and trained ethnic health work cadres, laying a preliminary foundation for health work in various minority areas.

The People's Government attaches great importance to the sports activities of the people. At present, many schools, government agencies, and factories across the country have implemented the method of broadcast exercises, which has had considerable success in enhancing physical fitness and improving the efficiency of production, work, and study. Various sports competitions have been held throughout the country. The Central Government and major administrative regions have established sports colleges to train sports work cadres.

Third, in scientific research: In the past few years, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has vigorously rectified its organization, earnestly conducted ideological and political education among scientific researchers, and has begun to cooperate with economic and national defense construction to carry out effective research work. The year before last, following the peaceful liberation of Tibet, a Tibetan scientific work team was sent, and it continues to work. Last year and this year, many investigation teams were sent to various parts of the country to study various resources and natural conditions. Up to now, considerable progress has been made in the investigation and research work on nodular cast iron, synthetic rubber, liquid fuel, weather forecasting, soil and water conservation, soil improvement, prevention and control of crop pests and diseases, aquaculture, geological and mineral exploration. To ensure the safety of basic industrial and mining construction, the Academy of Sciences is planning to establish seismic stations and has begun to run earthquake training courses. In February of this year, at the invitation of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the academy sent a delegation to the Soviet Union for a three-month visit and study, returning to China in May. Now, they are drawing on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and are beginning to rectify and further develop China's scientific research work.

Fourth, in cultural and artistic work: New people's culture and art have replaced the old imperialist, feudal, and bourgeois culture and art in a wide range. In the film industry, films produced by state-owned film studios and films translated from the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries have been welcomed by the masses. Cinemas, especially film projection teams, have seen significant development. In the field of drama, preliminary reforms have been made in the content and performance of old operas. In particular, the observation and performance conferences of local operas and folk music and dance held last autumn and this spring greatly promoted the improvement of local operas and the development of folk art activities. In addition, new music, dance, New Year pictures, comic strips, and slides have been greatly developed. Among literary and art workers, the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and the literary and art rectification study were carried out, further consolidating the leadership of the working class ideology in literary and art work. Cultural centers and cultural stations have been established quite universally throughout the country and are currently being rectified in order to better play the role of grassroots cultural organizations.

Fifth, in news and publishing: In the past four years, the national people's publishing industry, the People's Broadcasting Station, and the Xinhua News Agency have made great progress and improvement. In terms of book and journal publishing, state-owned publishing enterprises at all levels have been established, the book and journal distribution network has been developed, professional division of labor in publishing, printing, and distribution has been implemented, and the adjustment of private publishing has been partially carried out. The number of various publishing houses and branches of Xinhua Bookstore nationwide has increased. The content of all books, journals, pictures, and albums has been improved, and the number of copies issued has increased. The domestic and international organizational structure of Xinhua News Agency has been completely unified, and the propaganda effectiveness of the national news agency is increasing day by day. The People's Broadcasting Station has added some foreign languages and domestic minority languages, as well as individual local dialect broadcasts, and the effectiveness of domestic and foreign broadcasts has also been greatly improved. The editing work of newspapers at all levels has gradually improved, and newspapers in large administrative regions, provinces, cities, and some special regions, counties, and industrial and mining areas have been developed, which has played a great role in connecting with the masses, promoting work, and developing criticism and self-criticism.

Sixth, in foreign cultural liaison work: In the past four years, China has sent many cultural delegations abroad and held many exhibitions abroad; many countries have also sent cultural delegations, performing arts troupes, song and dance troupes, and art troupes to China, and held various exhibitions in China. In addition, work such as mutual sending of students and exchange of books, journals, and movies has also been carried out. These efforts have greatly helped China learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, as well as cultural exchanges between China and other countries.

The above-mentioned achievements in cultural and educational work have improved the political awareness and cultural level of the people across the country and have effectively helped the economic recovery and development. These achievements are inseparable from the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and are also inseparable from the hard work of all cultural, educational, scientific, health, news, and publishing workers and the people of the country.

However, there are still many problems and difficulties, many shortcomings and errors in our work.

What are the main problems and difficulties in our work? Our main problems and difficulties lie in the fact that our subjective conditions (including human, material and financial resources) are not adapted to the requirements of national construction (especially the requirements of training cadres) and the growing cultural demands of the people, and our subjective strength is far behind the needs of the country and the people. For example, the number of graduates from universities and colleges is far from sufficient to meet the needs of national construction, and the number of secondary school graduates is not sufficient to meet the needs of university and college enrolment; due to the rise of the people's economy and the improvement of cultural requirements, the number of secondary and primary schools cannot meet the requirements of graduates from senior primary schools entering higher education and children of school age entering schools. For example, the supply of medical resources and films and dramas is also far from meeting the needs of urban and rural residents. All of these are major problems and difficulties in cultural and educational work that have come with the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. These problems and difficulties can only be gradually solved and overcome over a considerable period of time, on the condition that economic construction has a certain foundation, plus our great efforts.

What are the main shortcomings and errors in our work? Our main shortcomings and errors lie in the fact that we have shown a tendency to blindly advance in cultural and educational work. Some leading organs and leading comrades in cultural and educational work often do not correctly combine needs and possibilities based on subjective and objective conditions, but only take care of needs and disregard possibilities, pursue quantity, ignore quality, only see today, do not see tomorrow, and carry out work greedily, quickly, and impetuously. This tendency of blind advance is the most important manifestation of subjectivism in our work over the past three years. It is precisely because we have committed this error of subjectivism that we have produced our serious style of bureaucracy that is divorced from reality and the masses.

One of the reasons for our subjective ideological errors is that we often have an incorrect understanding of the relationship between economy, politics and culture. Chairman Mao said: "With the arrival of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear." This means that cultural construction follows economic construction, not runs ahead of economic construction. But the subjectivism of some of our workers directly violates the above law, does not develop cultural and educational undertakings according to the correct proportion, and as a result, many of our undertakings are in a passive, difficult or even chaotic state; some of the work is of poor quality, very unconsolidated, and has a very unfavorable impact on future development; while on the other hand, it has created the phenomenon of too many tasks and forced commands in the work below, which is seriously divorced from the masses and turns some good things into bad things.

In order to correct errors and improve work, the Government Administration Council's Cultural and Educational Committee convened a meeting of directors of major administrative region cultural committees in January of this year. At this meeting, we reviewed the cultural and educational work of the past three years, affirmed the achievements, and at the same time strictly pointed out that blind advance was the main shortcoming in our cultural and educational work. In response to this situation, in order to enable national cultural and educational work to be more closely integrated with national economic construction in the first year of our implementation of the Five-Year Construction Plan, and to better serve economic construction, we proposed "rectification and consolidation, key development, improvement of quality, and steady progress" as the general guideline for improving cultural and educational work in the future. In order to correctly implement this policy, we also pointed out that we must oppose the tendency of blind advance, and at the same time prevent the conservative tendency of fearing difficulties and being satisfied with the status quo.

Following the general line of the transition period of gradually realizing socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, and according to the above-mentioned general guideline for improving cultural and educational work, we propose the following main tasks for national cultural and educational work this year and in the coming period:

I. Vigorously rectify and run well universities and colleges (especially higher industrial schools) and secondary technical schools, and effectively train talents for national economic construction. Continue to complete the adjustment of departments and specializations in universities and colleges nationwide and the adjustment of secondary technical schools, and steadily carry out teaching reform in various types of schools. Appropriately develop secondary schools to guarantee the source of freshmen in universities and colleges in terms of quantity and quality. Vigorously run senior and intermediate normal schools, and train existing teachers in rotation to improve quality and guarantee quantity.

II. Vigorously rectify and improve primary school education, overcome the current chaotic phenomenon in primary school education to some extent, and improve quality. Promote private primary schools (including complete primary schools), encourage private schools, and assist enterprises, institutions, and organizations to run schools to appropriately meet the requirements of school-age children to enter schools. Actively find ways to solve the problem of graduates from primary schools entering higher education and being trained to become skilled workers. Rectify the work of eliminating illiteracy, adopt the mass line, rely on mass teachers, adopt rapid literacy methods and all other effective methods, and steadily carry out the work of eliminating illiteracy.

III. Continue to carry out mass patriotic health campaigns, prevent and control the spread of epidemics, strengthen medical and health work in industrial and mining areas, better unite Chinese and Western medicine, improve public medical care, first improve medical prevention work in large cities, and vigorously rectify the work of county and district health centers and stations. Continue to carry out mass sports activities, establish sports colleges, and plan to train sports cadres.

IV. Strengthen scientific research institutions, focus on training scientific workers and continue to educate and unite scientific workers to improve the level of scientific research work, so that scientific research is closely integrated with national economic construction, and serve national economic construction, and carry out surveys and research work related to national economic construction and national defense construction in a planned manner.

V. In order to gradually adapt to the growing cultural demands of the people, continue to develop the film industry, pay attention to improving the quality of films, focus on developing domestic films and science and technology education films, and enrich and develop film projection teams. Strengthen the leadership of the work of theater troupes nationwide, focusing on rectifying state-owned theater troupes nationwide. Strengthen literary and artistic creation activities. Rectify county and district cultural centers and stations. Strengthen the editing and distribution of newspapers, periodicals, and popular reading materials. Rectify and improve the organization and work of radio listening networks in various places.

According to the above-mentioned guidelines and tasks, we began to compile the 1953 cultural and educational work plan as the first annual plan of the first five-year plan at the end of last year. According to our experience, the process of compiling this plan is also a process of gradually clarifying the situation, studying and determining the specific guidelines for various undertakings, and at the same time a process of in-depth inspection of work. The results of our implementation of the plan for eight months have proved that the 1953 cultural and educational work plan we formulated is basically in line with reality. Of course, because we started to formulate the plan, we lacked experience, so the content of the plan was not complete enough, and in the process of implementation, the plan itself was supplemented and revised due to further understanding of the situation. This is indeed a very good learning for us.

In order to correctly implement the 1953 cultural and educational work plan, and to improve leadership and improve work, we followed Chairman Mao's instructions and carried out the struggle against subjectivism, bureaucratism, and decentralism, and carried out inspections of the work of various cultural and educational departments. The steps were to first inspect the leading organs at the central level, launch criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from the bottom up, from discovering problems to solving problems, and especially paying attention to solving key problems. In this way, we set an example, and then promoted the leading organs at all levels below to also conduct in-depth inspections of their own work. As it stands now, the effect of doing so is very great, and the work of various cultural and educational departments has generally improved. The tendency of blind advance has been basically corrected.

In order to ensure that cultural and educational work follows the general line of the state's transition period, implements and realizes the established guidelines and tasks, and in order to successfully complete our plan, we believe that it is very important to do the following things well:

First, strengthen learning, which is an important key to improving work and improving ourselves. Chairman Mao said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "We must overcome difficulties, we must learn what we do not understand." All cultural and educational workers should first, on the existing basis, continue to carry out ideological remolding studies, combine with their own practical work, and systematically and seriously study Marxism-Leninism and current affairs and policies, and study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, in order to improve their own political level and professional level. For one's own profession, one should delve into it in depth, and strive to gradually become proficient. Study time should be appropriately allocated, not too much, so as not to overburden oneself, make it difficult to digest, and affect health. More attention should be paid to individual specific conditions, and the enthusiasm of each person should be brought into play on the basis of self-consciousness and voluntariness, and uniformity should not be forced, let alone any coercion.

Second, continue to strengthen the united front work in cultural and educational fields and consolidate our unity. All our cultural and educational workers are a broad united front team, including intellectuals in education, science, medicine, literature and art, news, and publishing, including Communist Party members, various democratic parties, and non-party people. It should be affirmed that our team is united. In order to complete our more arduous and glorious tasks, we should unite more firmly, help each other, and strive for progress. Any discrimination and exclusion against old intellectuals, old artists, traditional Chinese medicine doctors, or people who are slower to progress is wrong. Of course, it is equally wrong to blindly indulge them without education and transformation. Many old intellectuals, old artists, etc. have been encouraged by their own experience and their vision of the future of the country, and have gradually strengthened their sense of ownership. If in the past they were satisfied with mutual "politeness," then today merely having "politeness" would become the root of disunity. Everyone is the master, so what politeness is there? In the future, we must do more concrete work more patiently, and help everyone give full play to his talents, experience, and professional expertise according to different situations. Our unity will continue to be more consolidated, and our strength will be inexhaustible.

Third, conscientiously follow Chairman Mao's instructions and resolutely overcome subjectivism, bureaucratism, and decentralism. In the past, it was because our cultural and educational leading organs at all levels had these tendencies that our work had serious shortcomings. Now our country has begun the first five-year plan construction, and the roots of our entire transition period work must be more firmly rooted in the first and second years of the first five-year plan. The key to this lies in the fact that our leading organs and leading comrades strictly abide by Chairman Mao's teachings, are modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, work diligently and practically, study honestly, earnestly improve their own leadership style and leadership methods, proceed from the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government in everything, and according to the national plan, and according to the actual situation, do our own work with focus and center, and complete the tasks assigned to us by the country and the people.

    四年来的文化教育工作和今后的任务
    中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会主任  郭沫若
    四年来，新中国的文化教育工作，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导下，配合着各项社会改革运动和经济恢复工作，在恢复、改革和发展方面有了不少的成绩。
    第一、在教育工作方面：全国高等教育业已经过了初步的整顿和改革，并有了大的发展。在百分之九十以上的高等学校教师中，进行了思想改造的学习。在四分之三的高等学校中，进行了院系调整和专业设置工作，并在这个基础上开始普遍地进行着教学改革的工作，在教学内容、方法、组织和制度等方面有了很大的改进。旧时代的院系庞杂，学非所用的情况已经根本改变。普通中学、中等师范学校和中等技术学校也作了初步整顿，并有大的发展。新中国成立后，为培养工农出身的新知识分子，先后创办了中国人民大学和几十所工农速成中学。现在全国小学学生共有五千余万人，超过国民党统治时期小学生人数的最高年份（一九四六年）一倍以上。各类学校的教师一般都参加过各种社会改革和思想改造学习，教学内容和方法都作了初步的改革。学生的程度正在逐步提高。
    四年来，工农群众的教育和扫除文盲的工作也有了相当大的发展。首先在人民解放军中，推广了祁建华的速成识字法，获得了很大成绩。扫除文盲工作在工农干部和产业工人中也有显著收获。大批工人参加职工业余学校学习，几千万农民参加冬学和常年民校学习，其中已有很多人脱离了文盲状态。
    第二、在卫生体育工作方面：首先是开展了群众性的爱国卫生运动，初步地执行了以预防为主和卫生工作与群众运动相结合的方针，显著地减少了疫病的流行，并取得了粉碎美帝国主义细菌战的伟大胜利。在抗美援朝运动中，组织了许多志愿医疗手术队和卫生工作队，分赴朝鲜前线工作。医院、诊所、县卫生院、区卫生所、联合诊所和各种防疫机构都有了大的发展。由于实施了普遍的防疫工作，几年来全国人民的疾病发生率和死亡率已见减低，特别是产妇和婴儿的疾病死亡大大减少了。中央卫生部曾组织大批卫生工作人员分赴各少数民族地区，进行预防治疗工作，并在少数民族地区创设医疗机构，培养民族卫生工作干部，为各少数民族地区的卫生工作打下了初步的基础。
    人民政府很重视人民群众的体育运动。目前全国很多学校、机关、工厂都已经实行广播体操的办法，这对于增强体质，提高生产、工作和学习的效率方面已经收到相当的成效。全国各地大都举行了各项体育竞赛。中央和各大区并成立了体育学院，以培养体育工作干部。
    第三、在科学研究工作方面：中国科学院几年来大力整顿组织，在科学研究人员中认真地进行了思想政治教育，并开始配合经济和国防建设，进行有效的研究工作。前年，跟着西藏的和平解放，曾经派出了西藏科学工作队，目前仍在继续工作；去年和今年派出过不少次调查组到全国各地研究各种资源和自然条件。截至目前止，在关于球墨铸铁、合成橡胶、液体燃料、天气预报、水土保持、土壤改良、农作物病虫害防治、水产繁殖、地质矿产勘察等调查研究工作方面已经有了相当的成绩。为保证工矿基本建设的安全，科学院正筹划设立地震台，并已开始举办了地震训练班。今年二月该院应苏联科学院的邀请，派遣了一个代表团，到苏联去访问学习了三个月，已于五月回国。现在他们正参考着苏联的先进经验，着手整顿和进一步开展我国的科学研究工作。
    第四、在文化艺术工作方面：新的人民的文化艺术在广大范围内代替了旧的帝国主义的、封建主义的和资产阶级的文化艺术。在电影事业方面，国家制片厂制作的影片和翻译的苏联和各人民民主国家的影片已受到广大群众的欢迎。电影院、特别是电影放映队有了大的发展。在戏剧方面，对旧有戏曲在内容和演出方面都作了初步改革，特别是在去年秋天和今年春天举行了地方戏剧和民间音乐舞蹈的观摩会演，大大推动了地方戏剧的改进和民间文艺活动的开展。此外，新的音乐、舞蹈、年画、连环画、幻灯都有很大发展。在文艺工作者中曾进行了电影“武训传”的批判和文艺整风学习，进一步地巩固了工人阶级思想在文艺工作中的领导。全国各地相当普遍地设立了文化馆和文化站，目前正开始进行整顿，以便更大地发挥其基层文化组织的作用。
    第五、在新闻出版工作方面：四年来，全国人民出版事业、人民广播电台和新华通讯社的工作，都有了很大的发展和改进。在书刊出版方面，建立了国营各级出版事业，发展了书刊发行网，实行了出版、印刷、发行的专业分工，并局部进行了私营出版业的调整。全国各种出版社和新华书店的分支店都有增加。所有书刊、杂志、图片、画册的内容已有改进，发行数量已有增加。新华通讯社的国内外组织机构，已作到完全统一，国家通讯社的宣传效能正日益加强。人民广播电台增加了一些外国语和国内少数民族语言以及个别的地方方言的广播节目，对国内外广播的效力也大大提高。各级报纸的编辑工作已渐见改进，并发展了大行政区、省、市和部分专区、县和工矿区的报纸，在联系群众，推进工作，开展批评和自我批评方面，起了很大的作用。
    第六、在对外文化联络工作方面：四年来，我国派了许多文化性代表团出国，在国外举办了很多次的展览会；各国也派了不少的文化代表团、文工团、歌舞团、艺术团来我国，并在我国举办了各项展览会。此外如相互派遣留学生，交换书刊、电影等工作也都有开展。这些工作对我国学习苏联和各人民民主国家的先进经验以及我国和其他国家的文化交流上，有很大的帮助。
    上述的文教工作方面的成就，提高了全国人民群众的政治觉悟和文化水平，有效地帮助了经济的恢复和发展。这些成就是同中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导分不开的，同时也是同全体文化教育、科学卫生、新闻出版工作者和全国人民的努力奋斗分不开的。
    但是，在我们的工作中还有很多的问题和困难，很多的缺点和错误。
    什么是我们工作中的主要问题和困难呢？我们的主要问题和困难就在于：我们的主观条件（包括人力、物力和财力）跟国家建设的要求（特别是培养干部的要求）和人民日益增长的文化要求不相适应，我们的主观力量还远远地赶不上国家和人民的需要。例如高等学校的毕业生还远不足供应国家建设方面的需要，中学毕业生还不足供应高等学校招生的需要；由于人民经济的上升，文化要求的提高，中学小学的数量也不能满足高小毕业生升学和学龄儿童入学的要求。又如医疗力量和电影戏剧的供应，也都远不够适应城乡居民的需要。所有这些都是伴随着我国人民革命胜利而来的在文教工作中的主要问题和困难。这些问题和困难，是要在相当长的时期内，在经济建设有了一定基础的条件下，加上我们极大的努力，才能逐步地加以解决和克服的。
    什么是我们工作中的主要缺点和错误呢？我们的主要缺点和错误就在于：我们在文教工作中，表现了盲目冒进的倾向。一部分文教工作的领导机关和领导同志，常常不根据主客观条件，正确地结合需要和可能，而只顾需要，不顾可能，追求数量，忽视质量，只看到今天，不看到明天，贪多、图快、急躁地进行工作。这种盲目冒进的倾向就是三年多来我们工作中的主观主义的最主要的表现。正因为我们犯了这种主观主义的错误，所以才产生了我们严重地脱离实际和脱离群众的官僚主义的作风。
    我们的主观主义的错误思想的原因之一是我们对经济、政治与文化的关系往往有不正确的认识。毛主席说：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”这是说文化建设跟随着经济建设，而不是跑到经济建设的前头。但我们有些工作人员的主观主义却直接违反了上述的规律，不按正确的比例来发展文教事业，其结果就使得我们的许多事业陷于被动、困难甚至混乱；有些工作质量很差，很不巩固，给未来的发展以很不利的影响；而在另一方面又造成了下面工作中的任务过多和强迫命令的现象，严重地脱离群众，把某些好事办成了坏事。
    为了纠正错误并改进工作，今年一月间政务院文教委员会召开了大区文委主任会议。在这个会议上，我们检讨了过去三年来的文教工作，肯定了成绩，同时严格地指出了盲目冒进是我们文教工作中的主要缺点。针对这种状况，为使全国文教工作，在我国实行五年建设计划的第一年，更能密切地结合国家经济建设，并很好地为经济建设服务，我们提出了“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”作为今后改进文教工作的总方针。为要正确地贯彻这个方针，我们同时又指出，既要反对盲目冒进倾向，又要防止害怕困难、满足于现状的保守主义倾向。
    遵循着逐步实现社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的过渡时期的总路线，并根据上述改进文教工作的总方针，我们提出今年和今后一个时期内全国文教工作的主要任务如下：
      一、大力整顿和办好高等学校（特别是高等工业学校）和中等技术学校，有效地为国家培养经济建设人才。继续完成全国高等学校的院系调整和中等技术学校的调整，稳步地进行各类学校的教学改革。适当发展中学，在数量和质量上保证高等学校的新生来源。大力办好高级和中级师范学校，轮训现有师资，以提高质量、保证数量。
    二、大力整顿和改进小学教育，克服目前小学教育中的某种程度的混乱现象，提高质量。提倡民办小学（包括完小），鼓励私人办学，协助企业、机关、团体办学，以适当满足学龄儿童入学的要求。积极设法解决小学毕业生的升学与培养成为技术工人问题。整顿扫除文盲工作，采用群众路线，依靠群众教师，采用速成识字法及其他一切有效方法，稳步地开展扫盲工作。
    三、继续开展群众爱国卫生运动，防止和控制疫病的流行，加强工矿医疗卫生工作，更好地团结中西医，改进公费医疗，首先改进大城市的医疗预防工作，并大力整顿县、区卫生院、所的工作。继续开展群众性的体育活动，设立体育学院，有计划地培养体育干部。
    四、加强科学研究机构，着重培养科学工作干部和继续教育团结科学工作者，以提高科学研究工作的水平，使科学研究与国家经济建设密切结合，并为国家经济建设服务，有步骤地开展有关国家经济建设和国防建设的勘察与研究工作。
    五、为逐步适应人民群众日益增长的文化要求，继续发展电影事业，注意提高影片质量，注重发展国产影片和科学技术教育影片，充实并发展电影放映队。加强对全国剧团工作的领导，着重整顿全国国营剧团。加强文艺创作活动。整顿县、区文化馆、站。加强报纸、刊物和通俗读物的编辑发行。整理和提高各地广播收音网的组织和工作。
    根据上述方针和任务，我们从去年年底就着手编制一九五三年的文教工作计划，作为第一个五年计划的第一年度计划。依据我们的经验，这个编制计划的过程，也就是逐渐明了情况、研究和确定各项事业具体方针的过程，同时也是深入检查工作的过程。八个月来我们执行计划的结果证明，我们所制订的一九五三年文教工作计划，大体上是切合实际的。当然由于我们开始制订计划，缺乏经验，因而计划的内容是不够完备的，而在执行过程中由于进一步了解情况，计划本身也得到了补充和修正。这在我们确实是一个很好的学习。
    为了正确地执行一九五三年文教工作的计划，和提高领导，改进工作，我们遵照毛主席的指示，进行了反对主观主义、官僚主义和分散主义的斗争，进行了各文教部门工作的检查。其步骤是先检查中央一级的领导机关，展开批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，从发现问题到解决问题，特别是注意解决关键性的问题。这样作出榜样，然后推动下面各级领导机关也能深入地检查自己的工作。以现在情形看，这样做的效果是很大的，各文教部门的工作一般地都有了改进。盲目冒进的倾向基本上已得到纠正。
    为了保证文教工作遵循着国家过渡时期的总路线、贯彻和实现既定的方针任务，为了胜利地完成我们的计划，我们认为做好以下几件事情是很关重要的：
    第一、加强学习，这是改进工作、提高自己的重要关键。毛主席在“论人民民主专政”一文中说：“我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。”全体文教工作人员首先应在已有的基础上，继续进行思想改造的学习，结合自己的实际工作，有计划地、认真地学习马克思列宁主义和时事政策，学习苏联先进经验，以提高自己的政治水平和业务水平。对于自己的业务，应该深入钻研，务求逐步精通。学习时间，应予适当支配，不要过多，以免负担过重，不易消化，并影响健康。更应照顾各人具体条件，在自觉自愿的基础上，发挥各人的积极性，不应强求一律，更不得有所强迫。
    第二、继续加强文教方面的统一战线工作，巩固我们的团结。我们全体文教工作者，是一支广大的统一战线的队伍，其中包括教育、科学、医药、文艺、新闻、出版各方面的知识分子，包括共产党员、各民主党派和无党无派人士。应该肯定，我们的队伍是团结的。为了完成我们更加艰巨光荣的任务，我们就应该更加巩固地团结起来，互相帮助，力求进步。对于旧知识分子、旧艺人、中医或进步较慢的人加以任何的歧视和排斥，都是错误的。当然，对他们一味迁就，不加教育和改造，也同样是错误的。许多旧知识分子、旧艺人等从自身的体验和对国家前途的瞻望中得到了鼓舞，逐渐加强了主人翁的感觉。假如过去还满足于相互间的“客气”，那么在今天仅有“客气”就会成为涣散团结的根源了。大家都是主人，何客之有？我们今后要更加耐心地做更多的具体工作，根据不同情况帮助每一个人发挥他的才智、经验和业务专长。我们的团结将会不断地更加巩固，我们的力量将会是无穷尽的。
    第三、切实遵照毛主席的指示，坚决克服主观主义、官僚主义和分散主义。过去就因为我们各级文教领导机关有了这些倾向，致使我们的工作有严重的缺点。现在我们的国家已经开始第一个五年计划建设，我们整个过渡时期工作的根必须在第一个五年计划的第一、第二年度内更加扎稳。这里决定的关键，在于我们的领导机关和领导同志严格遵守毛主席的教导，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，踏踏实实地工作，老老实实地学习，切实改进自己的领导作风和领导方法，一切从中国共产党和中央人民政府的政策出发，按照国家计划，根据实际情况，有重点、有中心地做好自己的工作，完成国家和人民所交给我们的任务。
