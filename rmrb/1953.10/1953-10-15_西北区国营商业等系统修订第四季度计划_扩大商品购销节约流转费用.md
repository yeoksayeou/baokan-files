The Northwest Region State-Owned Commercial, Foreign Trade, and Salt Industry systems recently revised and expanded their commodity circulation plans for the fourth quarter, while also adding new conservation plans.

In terms of commodity circulation, the revised fourth-quarter purchase plan for the Northwest Region State-Owned Commercial System increased by 21.52% compared to the actual performance of the same period last year. The sales plan increased by 44.56% compared to the actual performance of the same period last year. The revised sales plan for the Foreign Trade System increased by 51% compared to the actual performance of the same period last year. The Salt Industry System also increased by 5.73% compared to the actual performance of the same period last year. In terms of profit delivery in the fourth quarter, the State-Owned Commercial System plans to overfulfill the target by 8.39%, and the Foreign Trade System plans to overfulfill the target by 22.36%. To rationally use funds and reduce cash hoarding, the capital turnover rate of the commercial system in the fourth quarter is planned to accelerate by 0.01 times compared to last year. Due to the expansion of commodity circulation and increased work efficiency, the Northwest State-Owned Commercial System plans to save 10.7 billion yuan in commodity circulation costs in the fourth quarter. The Salt Industry System also plans to save 3 billion yuan in costs, accumulating more funds for the country.

In order to ensure the completion of the aforementioned production increase and conservation tasks, and to strive for overfulfillment, the Northwest Commercial Administration Bureau, the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Trade stationed in the Northwest, and the Northwest Salt Affairs Administration Bureau, based on their own business situations, require their subordinate units to take the following measures: 1. Close contact should be maintained between upper and lower levels of each business department, and political leadership should be strengthened to mobilize and rely on all employees to find shortcuts, tap potential, and launch a production increase and conservation competition to strive for the overfulfillment of this year's purchase and sales plans and the fourth quarter's production increase and conservation plans. 2. Rapidly resolve difficulties in transportation work. The fourth quarter is the peak season for commerce, and with the development of national construction, transportation capacity will be even more inadequate. To ensure market supply, meet the needs of the people, and complete purchase and sales tasks, transportation problems must be resolved quickly and effectively. Each business department must prepare transportation plans, actively contact relevant transportation departments, use various transportation tools, and strive to transport materials to various supply points in a timely manner. 3. Correctly grasp price policies. At present, regional price differences for certain commodities are not appropriately wide or narrow, and some wholesale-retail price differences and quality price differences are not reasonable enough. In addition to the Provincial and Municipal Commercial Departments and Bureaus conducting a comprehensive inspection of existing urban-rural price differences and making appropriate adjustments to unreasonable ones, each business unit is also required to study existing problems in prices at any time and promptly report them to higher-level leaders for research and handling. 4. Based on the continuous development of industrial and agricultural production and the need to expand urban-rural material exchange, state-owned commerce should strengthen its leadership over the market, expand and consolidate the wholesale position. In retail, state-owned commerce should lead private merchants to work together to expand urban-rural material exchange while ensuring the stability of retail prices.

    西北区国营商业等系统修订第四季度计划
    扩大商品购销节约流转费用
    西北区国营商业、对外贸易和盐业等系统，于最近修订扩大了第四季度的商品流转计划，同时并增订了节约计划。
    在商品流转方面，西北区国营商业系统修改后的第四季度购进计划，比去年同期实绩增加了百分之二十一点五二；销售计划比去年同期实绩增加百分之四十四点五六；对外贸易系统修改后的销售计划，较去年同期实绩增加了百分之五十一；盐业系统也比去年同期实绩增加百分之五点七三。第四季度在上缴利润方面，国营商业系统计划超额完成百分之八点三九；对外贸易系统计划超额完成百分之二十二点三六。为合理使用资金，减少现金积压，第四季度商业系统的资金周转率，计划要比去年加速点零一次，由于扩大了商品流转，提高了工作效率，西北国营商业系统在第四季度计划节约商品流转费用一百零七亿元；盐业系统也计划节省费用三十亿元，为国家积累更多的资金。
    为了保证上述增产节约任务的完成，并争取超额完成，西北商业管理局、中央对外贸易部驻西北特派员办事处与西北盐务管理局根据本身业务情况，要求所属单位必须采取如下措施：一、各级业务部门上下间要密切联系，并加强政治领导，动员和依靠全体职工，找窍门、挖潜力、展开增产节约竞赛，争取今年购销计划和第四季度增产节约计划的超额完成。二、迅速解决运输工作中的困难。第四季度是商业旺季，加以国家建设事业的发展，运输力量将更感不足，为保证市场供应，满足人民需要，完成购销任务，必须迅速而切实地解决运输工作中的问题。各业务部门必须作好运输计划，主动联系有关运输部门，利用各种运输工具，争取及时把物资运输到各供应地点。三、正确掌握价格政策。目前某些商品的地区差价宽紧不当，部分批零差价、品质差价还不够合理。除各省、市商业厅、局必须对现行城乡差价等进行一次全面检查，对不合理的进行适当调整外，并要求各业务单位随时研究价格上存在的问题，及时反映给上级领导，以便研究处理。四、根据工、农业生产不断发展，城乡物资交流必须扩大的情况，国营商业应加强对市场的领导，扩大和巩固批发阵地；在零售方面，国营商业应在保证零售价格稳定的条件下，领导私商共同为扩大城乡物资交流而努力。
