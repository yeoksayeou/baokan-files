    Kangding is located on the Kang-Tibet Plateau, between the Erlang Mountains and the Zheduo Mountains. Surrounded by mountains, its terrain is strategic, serving as the throat of communication between Kang and Tibet. It is one of the three major cities in Xikang Province, along with Ya'an and Xichang, and is now the location of the Tibetan Autonomous Region government.

    Since the Kangxi era of the Qing Dynasty, Kangding has been a distribution market for Tibetan-Han trade. Tibetan merchants dealing in Tibetan specialties such as cordyceps, musk, furs, and medicinal materials, travel from Litang, Dege, and Ganzi, crossing the Zheduo Mountains, which are over 4,000 meters high, to Kangding. Simultaneously, Han merchants dealing in tea, salt, and some general merchandise, cross the Erlang Mountains and the Daxiangling Mountains, which are over 3,000 meters high, to meet in Kangding for centralized transactions.

    After liberation, the People's Government correctly implemented the national trade policy, vigorously developing production and national trade. With the active support of the state-owned economy, Kangding's transactions have become more and more active.

    The development of state-owned commerce in Kangding has had a significant impact on improving the lives of the Tibetan people. In 1950, there was only one local product company in the area. To further meet the needs of the vast Tibetan people, a department store was added in 1951, and three companies for grain, tea, and animal husbandry were added in 1952. As a result, the proportion of state-owned commerce in local public and private sales has also increased (from 15.73% to 46.38%). Tea bricks, the main commodity in market transactions, have been completely controlled by state-owned trade for supply and marketing since 1951. The state-owned company's supply of tea to Tibetans increased from 18,148 dan in 1950 to 73,205 dan in 1952, exceeding the highest historical record. The total supply and sale of other daily necessities needed by Tibetans, including tea, grain, and salt, totaled 102.94 billion yuan in the past three years. At the same time, state-owned companies have also actively carried out the purchase of local specialties such as musk, anemarrhena, and cordyceps from Tibetan areas, with a purchase amount of 49.8 billion yuan. Due to the development of purchase and sales business by state-owned commerce, the prices of local specialties in Tibetan areas have gradually become more reasonable. Before liberation, each dan of Kangding wool could only be exchanged for three packages of border tea, but after liberation, each dan could be exchanged for eight and a half packages. Before liberation, every 100 jin of anemarrhena could be exchanged for 22 packages of border tea, but after 1952, it could be exchanged for 44 packages. At the same time, the prices of daily necessities such as tea, oil, cloth, and salt required by Tibetans have decreased year by year. In 1952, the prices of daily necessities decreased by 13% to 32% compared to 1950. This has greatly improved the lives of the Tibetan people.

    Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, private industry and commerce in Kangding have also developed rapidly in the past three years. The total number of private industrial and commercial enterprises in the county was 666 in 1950, with a total capital of 8.47 billion yuan; 769 in 1951, with a capital of 10.15 billion yuan; and by 1952, it had increased to 926, with a capital of 10.86 billion yuan. Among the private industrial and commercial enterprises, there were more than 660 private commercial enterprises, with a capital of 9.48 billion yuan; among them, 48 were Tibetan merchants (mostly engaged in "Guozhuang" businesses), with funds accounting for 43.7% of the total capital of all private merchants.

    With the strengthening of national unity and the development of transportation in Tibetan areas, commerce has been enlivened, stimulating agricultural and animal husbandry production, and the purchasing power of the vast Tibetan people has also increased accordingly. In the past, it was difficult for Tibetans to eat tea, often using wild leaves as a substitute. Even if they had real tea, they would boil it many times, "rich people boil it three times, and poor people boil it seven times." Now everyone can buy tea to drink. In the past, ordinary Tibetans could not afford cloth, and herdsmen often did not wear pants. Now most herdsmen buy cloth to make clothes. According to a typical survey of three bao in the Muya District of Kangding: the income of Tibetan farmers and herdsmen from agriculture, animal husbandry, local specialties, and other sideline industries has been increasing year by year. The income in 1952 increased by 19.6% compared to 1950. The average purchasing power per capita of Tibetans was 252,919 yuan in 1950, 280,000 yuan in 1951, and rose to 328,271 yuan in 1952, an increase of more than 29% compared to 1950. Before liberation, the Tibetan Bai Gai Xiruo guarded temples in the lama temple, had no land or houses, and his family of four could not eat tea all year round. After liberation, he opened nearly 20 mu of wasteland, built new houses, increased his income, and improved his life. In 1951, his family ate 81 jin of tea, but in 1952, the tea consumption increased to 117 jin.

### 藏族自治区康定县商业日益繁荣

    藏族自治区康定县商业日益繁荣
    康定位置在康藏高原上，在二郎山和折多山中间，周围群山环抱，形势险要，是康藏交通的咽喉。它和雅安、西昌同为西康省三大城市之一，现今是藏族自治区政府所在地。
    康定自清朝康熙年代起，就是藏汉贸易的集散市场。经营藏区虫草、麝香、皮毛、药材等土特产的藏商，经过理塘、德格、甘孜一线，翻越四千多公尺的折多山前来康定，与翻越三千多公尺的二郎山、大象岭前往藏区经营茶叶、食盐及部分百货的汉商，每年在康定会合进行集中交易。
    解放后，人民政府正确执行了民族贸易政策，大力发展生产和民族贸易，在国营经济积极扶助下，康定的交易一天比一天地活跃起来了。
    康定国营商业的发展，对改善藏族人民生活具有重大影响。一九五○年该地只有一个土产公司。为进一步满足广大藏区人民需要，一九五一年增设了百货公司，一九五二年又增设了粮食、茶叶、畜业三个公司。因此，国营商业在当地公私销货额的比重也随之增长（由百分之十五点七三增至百分之四十六点三八）。市场交易中的主要货品——茶包，自一九五一年开始，已全部由国营贸易掌握供销。国营公司对藏民茶叶的供应，一九五○年为一万八千一百四十八市担，一九五二年就增至七万三千二百零五市担，超过了历史上的最高纪录。藏民所需的其他百货、粮食、食盐等生活必需品，连茶叶在内，三年来总计供销一千零二十九亿四千余万元。同时，对藏区的麝香、知母、虫草等土特产，国营公司亦积极展开收购工作，收购额达四百九十八亿元。由于国营商业购销业务的发展，藏区的土特产价格也逐步趋于合理，解放前康定羊毛每担仅能换边茶三包，解放后每担则能换边茶八包半，解放前每百斤知母换边茶二十二包，解放后，到一九五二年即可换边茶四十四包。与此同时，藏民所需的茶、油、布、食盐等日用必需品价格则逐年降低，一九五二年日用品较一九五○年降低百分之十三到百分之三十二。这样就使藏族人民的生活大大得到改善。
    康定私营工商业，在国营经济的领导下，三年来也获得迅速的发展。全县私营工商业，一九五○年有六百六十六户，资本总额为八十四亿七千万元；一九五一年为七百六十九户，资本为一百零一亿五千万元；到一九五二年已增至九百二十六户，资本为一百零八亿六千余万元。私营工商业中，私营商业有六百六十余户，资本为九十四亿八千万元；其中藏商四十八户（多经营“锅庄”业），拥有资金占全部私商资本总额的百分之四十三点七。
    随着民族团结的加强和藏区交通的发展，活跃了商业，刺激了农牧业生产，广大藏民的购买力也相应提高了。过去藏民很难吃到茶叶，常以野叶代替，即或有了真茶也煮熬多次，“有钱人煮三次，无钱人熬七道”，现在人人都可以买到茶叶吃了。过去一般藏民买不起布，牧民经常不穿裤子，现在大部分牧民都买布做衣服穿了。根据康定木雅区三个保的典型调查：藏民农牧业、土特产业及其他副业的收入，逐年都在增加，一九五二年收入较一九五○年增加百分之十九点六。藏民每人平均购买力，一九五○年为二十五万二千九百一十九元，一九五一年为二十八万元，一九五二年则上升为三十二万八千二百七十一元，比一九五○年提高了百分之二十九多。藏民白丐喜若，解放前在喇嘛寺看守庙宇，无土地房屋，一家四口，终年吃不到茶叶，解放后开了将近二十亩荒地，新盖了房屋，收入增多，生活改善，一九五一年一家吃茶叶八十一斤，但到一九五二年吃茶叶就增加到一百一十七斤了。
