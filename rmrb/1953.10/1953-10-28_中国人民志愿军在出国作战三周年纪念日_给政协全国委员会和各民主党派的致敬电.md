To the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, various democratic parties, and the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea:

    On the occasion of commemorating the third anniversary of our army's participation in the war abroad, we extend our highest respect and heartfelt gratitude to the great people of the motherland and the great leader Chairman Mao. The victory achieved by our army in the past three years of fighting abroad is the result of the full support of the people of the motherland under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao. The victory and glory should belong to the great people of the motherland and the great leader Chairman Mao.

    Currently, the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang are unwilling to accept their defeat and are trying every possible means to undermine the prisoner of war repatriation agreement, obstruct and sabotage the convening of the political conference, and constantly violate the armistice agreement. All commanders and combatants of our army have seriously noted the enemy's conspiracy and are guarding their positions with high vigilance, strengthening their defenses, and determined to prevent all possible aggression and provocation from the other side. All commanders and combatants of our army will live up to the expectations of the people of the motherland, continue to strengthen the fighting solidarity with the heroic Korean people, continue to ensure the accurate implementation of the armistice agreement, strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, safeguard the security and construction of the motherland, and defend peace in the Far East and the world!

    All commanders and combatants of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    October 25th

    中国人民志愿军在出国作战三周年纪念日
    给政协全国委员会和各民主党派的致敬电中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会、各民主党派、中国人民抗美援朝总会：
    在纪念我军出国作战三周年的时候，谨向伟大的祖国人民和伟大的领袖毛主席致崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢。我军出国作战三年来所取得的胜利，是在伟大领袖毛主席英明领导下的祖国人民全力支援的结果，胜利与光荣应该属于伟大的祖国人民和伟大的领袖毛主席。
    目前，美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮不甘心于它们的失败，正在千方百计地破坏遣俘协议，阻挠和破坏政治会议的召开，并不断破坏停战协定。我军全体指挥员、战斗员已经严重地注意了敌人的这种阴谋，正在以高度的警惕坚守阵地，加强戒备，决心阻止来自对方的一切可能的侵袭和挑衅行动。我军全体指挥员、战斗员定将不负祖国人民的期望，继续加强和英雄的朝鲜人民的战斗团结，继续为保障停战协定的确切实施，为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，为保卫祖国的安全与建设，为保卫远东与世界和平而奋斗不懈！
    中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员  十月二十五日
