(Xinhua News Agency, October 10th) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China received three notifications from the U.S. government via the Swedish Embassy in China, concerning the political conference, delivered through the Swedish government on September 19, 24, and October 9, 1953, respectively. Zhou Enlai, Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, issued a response statement to the aforementioned three notifications on October 10, 1953. On the same afternoon, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government sent Minister Zhou Enlai's statement to the Swedish Embassy, requesting its transmission to the Swedish government and then to the U.S. government. It also hoped to receive a response from the U.S. government through the Swedish government. On the same evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government telegraphed Minister Zhou Enlai's statement to Mr. Hammarskjöld, Secretary-General of the United Nations, requesting its transmission to Mrs. Pandit, President of the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

    At the same time, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea received the aforementioned three notifications from the U.S. government, transmitted by the Swedish government, regarding the political conference. Nam Il, Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, also issued a similar response statement on October 10, 1953, and entrusted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to transmit the aforementioned statement to the Swedish government and then to the U.S. government, hoping to receive a response from the U.S. government through the Swedish government. On the same day, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government forwarded Foreign Minister Nam Il's statement to the Swedish Embassy.

    The full text of Minister Zhou Enlai's statement is as follows:

    The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has taken note of, and jointly studied with the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the three notifications from the U.S. government, transmitted through the Swedish government on September 19, 24, and October 9, respectively.

    I am now authorized to state on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China as follows:

    1.  On September 13 and 14, 1953, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in their respective telegrams to Mr. Hammarskjöld, Secretary-General of the United Nations, proposed four suggestions regarding the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly taking prompt steps to expand the membership of the political conference so that this conference could be convened quickly. These suggestions have been formally notified to the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Mr. Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations, proposed in a letter to the President of the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 18 that the aforementioned suggestions of the Chinese and Korean governments be included in the agenda. However, the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly refused to include it in the agenda. The Central People's Government considers this an unreasonable manifestation of the United Nations General Assembly's violation of the principle of peaceful negotiation of international disputes and expresses deep regret over this.

    2.  The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has always believed that the political conference should not be a repetition of the Panmunjom negotiation format, but should have the participation of other relevant neutral countries in addition to the belligerent parties in Korea, in order to facilitate the smooth progress of the conference, so as to seek solutions to issues such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the peaceful settlement of the Korean question. However, the United Nations General Assembly has abandoned the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, positioned itself as a hostile party in the Korean conflict, and complied with the opinions of a few countries opposing India's participation in the political conference, depriving the vast majority of member states of the United Nations of their right to resolve international disputes by peaceful means in accordance with the Charter. The Central People's Government believes that this action by the United Nations General Assembly further diminishes the already almost completely lost prestige of the United Nations, and it makes it increasingly clear that the United Nations is continuing to serve the interests of creating international tensions for the aggressors.

    3.  Nevertheless, in order to uphold the policy of peaceful settlement of the Korean question in order to consolidate peace in Asia and the world, and in order to promote the rapid convening of the political conference, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, after consultation with the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, agrees that the governments of Korea and China will appoint representatives to hold talks with U.S. representatives on issues concerning the political conference.

    4.  This meeting should not only resolve the issues of the location and time of the political conference, but more importantly, should resolve the issue of the membership of the political conference.

    5.  Since this meeting is limited to the belligerent parties in Korea, the venue for the meeting should preferably be at Panmunjom in Korea.

    Zhou Enlai

    对美国关于政治会议的三个通知
    周恩来外长提出答复声明
    朝鲜外务相南日向美国提出同样的答复
    【新华社十日讯】    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部在一九五三年九月十九日、二十四日和十月九日，先后接到驻我国的瑞典大使馆交来的美国政府经由瑞典政府致送的关于政治会议的三个通知。我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长在一九五三年十月十日对上述三个通知提出了答复声明。同日下午，我中央人民政府外交部已将周恩来部长的上述声明送致瑞典大使馆，请其转致瑞典政府然后转致美国政府。并望经过瑞典政府得到美国政府的回答。同日晚，我中央人民政府外交部并已将周恩来部长的上述声明用电报拍给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德先生，请其转致联合国第八届大会主席潘迪特夫人。
    与此同时，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府接到了瑞典政府转交的上述美国政府关于政治会议的三个通知。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府外务相南日也已在一九五三年十月十日提出了同样的答复声明，并委托中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部将上述声明转致瑞典政府然后转致美国政府，并望经过瑞典政府得到美国政府的回答。同日，我中央人民政府外交部已将南日外务相的上述声明转致瑞典大使馆。
    周恩来外长的声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府已经注意到了、并已与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府共同研究了美国政府经由瑞典政府于九月十九日、二十四日和十月九日先后转来的三个通知。
    我现在受权代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府声明如下：
    一、一九五三年九月十三日、十四日，中华人民共和国中央人民政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在其先后答复联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德先生的电文中，曾经提出了关于第八届联合国大会应尽速采取步骤来扩大政治会议成员、使这个会议得以迅速召开的四项建议。这些建议已经由联合国秘书长正式通知了第八届联合国大会。苏联驻联合国代表团维辛斯基团长在九月十八日致联合国第八届大会主席函中曾提出将中、朝两国政府的上述建议列入议程。但是，第八届联合国大会竟拒不列入议程。中央人民政府认为这是联合国大会违背和平协商国际争端的原则的无理表现，并对此深表遗憾。
    二、中华人民共和国中央人民政府始终认为，政治会议不应该是板门店谈判形式的重复，而应该有除朝鲜交战双方之外的其他有关中立国家参加，以利会议的顺利进行，从而谋求撤退一切外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题等问题的解决。但联合国大会竟抛弃联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，自居于朝鲜交战中的敌对一方，并顺从少数国家反对印度参加政治会议的意见，剥夺联合国绝大多数会员国根据宪章以和平方法解决国际争端的权利。中央人民政府认为，联合国大会的这种行动使联合国几近完全丧失的威信更加丧失，它使人们日益看清联合国正在继续为侵略者制造国际紧张局势的利益而服务。
    三、虽然如此，中华人民共和国中央人民政府为了坚持和平解决朝鲜问题以利巩固亚洲及世界和平的政策，为了推动政治会议的迅速召开，经过与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府协商之后，同意由朝、中两国政府指派代表与美国代表进行关于政治会议问题的会谈。
    四、这一会谈不仅应当解决政治会议的地点和时间问题，而且更主要的是应当解决政治会议的成员问题。
    五、由于这一会谈仅限于朝鲜交战双方，所以会谈的地点以在朝鲜板门店为宜。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来
    一九五三年十月十日于北京
