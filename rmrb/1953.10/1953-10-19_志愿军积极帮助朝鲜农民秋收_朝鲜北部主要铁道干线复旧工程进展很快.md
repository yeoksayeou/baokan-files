Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 18th: The autumn crops in northern Korea have ripened, and the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) are actively helping the Korean people with the harvest.

Since late September, various units of the Chinese People's Volunteers have been helping the Korean people with the autumn harvest. In the first few days of October, a certain unit on the eastern front helped local families of revolutionary martyrs, families of military personnel, and residents affected by the war harvest more than 145,670 mu of crops. A certain unit formed a harvesting team of over 300 people to help residents harvest in more distant harvesting areas, working during the day and living in tents they brought with them at night. A certain unit on the front lines of Shangganling also organized a harvesting brigade, helping nearby residents harvest more than 60 mu of rice, and dispatched eight trucks to transport the harvested rice and straw from the fields to the residents' homes. Cadres and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers leading organs also used their spare time to help residents in the area with the autumn harvest. On October 4th alone, they harvested more than 30 mu of crops.

In helping the Korean people with the autumn harvest, the Chinese People's Volunteers soldiers displayed a high degree of internationalist labor enthusiasm. Some units' blacksmith shops specially forged many sickles from scrap iron before the autumn harvest. Many units used their entertainment time and Sunday holidays to help residents with the harvest. They worked hard from early morning to late at night, completing the harvest tasks ahead of schedule. The 8th Company of a certain unit on the "Dingzishan" front used their rest time to cross mountains and ridges to help residents harvest in remote mountainous areas, harvesting more than 8 mu of crops in one day, and also delivered the threshed grain to the residents' homes. During the harvest, the soldiers ensured gentle cutting and placing, avoiding any waste of grain. They said: We must cherish the Korean people's grain as we cherish our motherland's grain, and ensure that the Korean people are satisfied.

The Korean people are extremely grateful for the enthusiastic help of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Elementary school students organized song and dance troupes to perform and express their appreciation in the fields. Korean women brought trays of apples and chestnuts to offer to the soldiers, but they were all declined by the soldiers. A Korean woman said emotionally: "How can I express the gratitude of my family? I can only respond with practical actions by actively participating in the work of restoration and construction!"

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 16th: With the vigorous assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers Railway Corps, the restoration project of major railway trunk lines in northern Korea is progressing very rapidly. From August to date, the Chinese People's Volunteers Railway Corps, in coordination with Korean railway workers, has reinforced all the lines already in operation and the abandoned tracks that are not yet open to traffic, increased the number of station tracks and water supply equipment, and completed more than two-thirds of the bridge and culvert construction projects.

In carrying out the restoration project, the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers Railway Corps displayed internationalist labor enthusiasm. The famous "Yang Liandi Company" completed the engineering task ahead of schedule when rebuilding a certain bridge on the Qingchuan River. When a certain unit was building a large river bridge, the soldiers soaked in the water day and night, trying to use cranes to salvage several steel beams, weighing about 200 tons, that had sunk into the mud in the river. On another large river bridge, a steel beam weighing about 200 tons and spanning 60 meters was displaced by 2.5 meters due to the impact of enemy aircraft bombing. The soldiers created a new method and pulled it back into position in just twelve minutes.

The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers Railway Corps paid close attention to saving the Korean people's resources. Under the principle of ensuring project quality, they tried their best to collect or utilize the original old materials and waste materials. The water supply equipment of thirty-two stations were all repaired by using local materials and waste materials. All the steel beams and other materials for the two hundred large and small bridges that have been repaired have also been remade using old and waste materials. Some steel beams were damaged and could not be used, so the soldiers dismantled them all for repair or reduction, and then welded them together.

When repairing several river bridges, the engineering team of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers Railway Corps learned from the advanced methods of the Soviet Union in repairing bridges, mechanically pulling the bridge piers, which had been shaken several meters away from their original positions by enemy bombing, back into position, and then carrying out reinforcement work around them, saving 350 tons of cement. In the reinforcement project of the lines, the soldiers collected many damaged steel rails, reduced them for use as spare materials, and used the sleepers replaced from the pontoon bridges as much as possible to support the rails, so that some lines that were not open to traffic during the war could also be quickly opened to traffic.

    志愿军积极帮助朝鲜农民秋收
    朝鲜北部主要铁道干线复旧工程进展很快
    【新华社平壤十八日电】朝鲜北部的秋季农作物已经成熟，中国人民志愿军各部队正积极地帮助朝鲜人民收割。
    中国人民志愿军各部从九月下旬起就帮助朝鲜人民进行秋收。东线某部在十月份的头几天中，就帮助当地的烈属、军属以及遭受战争灾害的居民收割了十四万五千六百七十多亩庄稼。某部组成了一支三百多人的收割队，到较远的收割区去帮助居民收割，他们白天劳作，晚上就住在自己带去的帐篷里。上甘岭前线的某部也组织了收割大队，帮助附近居民收割了六十多亩稻子，并且派了八辆汽车把收下来的稻子和稻草从田里送到居民家里。中国人民志愿军领导机关的干部和战士也利用工作的空隙时间，帮助驻地居民秋收。他们在十月四日一天中就收割了三十多亩庄稼。
    在帮助朝鲜人民秋收中，中国人民志愿军战士发挥了高度的国际主义劳动热情。有些部队的铁匠炉在秋收前专门用废铁打了许多镰刀。许多部队利用娱乐时间和星期日假期来帮助居民收割。他们起早带晚努力劳动，提前完成收割任务。“丁字山”前线的某部第八连利用休息时间翻山越岭到偏僻的山区去帮助居民收割，在一天内收割了八亩多庄稼，并且还把打好的粮食送到居民家里。在收割时，战士们做到轻割轻放，不轻易浪费一粒粮食。他们说：我们要像爱护祖国的粮食一样爱护朝鲜人民的粮食，要保证朝鲜人民满意。
    朝鲜人民对中国人民志愿军的热情帮助极为感谢。小学生们组织了歌舞队到田间去表演和慰问。朝鲜妇女们将一盆盆苹果和栗子送去要战士们吃，但都被战士们谢绝了。一个朝鲜妇女感动地说：“用什么来表达我一家人的感激呢？我只好用积极参加恢复建设工作的实际行动来回答你们！”
    【新华社平壤十六日电】在中国人民志愿军铁道部队的大力帮助下，朝鲜北部各主要铁道干线的复旧工程，进展十分迅速。自八月份到目前为止，中国人民志愿军铁道部队配合朝鲜铁路员工，已加固了全部已经通车的线路和未通车的废道，增加了车站股道和给水设备，桥梁和涵洞的修建工程也已经完成了三分之二以上。
    在进行复旧工程中，中国人民志愿军铁道部队的指挥员、战斗员们发挥了国际主义的劳动热情。著名的“杨连第连”在重建清川江某座桥梁时，提前完成了工程任务。某部在修建一座大江桥时，战士们日夜浸在水里，设法用起重机把几孔沉在江中淤泥里的重约二百吨的钢梁打捞上来。另一座大江桥上有一孔重约二百吨、跨渡六十公尺的钢梁在敌机轰炸时，受到震动，错位了二公尺半。战士们创造了新的方法，只用十二分钟时间就把它拉回正位。
    中国人民志愿军铁道部队的指挥员、战斗员们十分注意节约朝鲜人民的资材。他们在保证工程质量的原则下，尽量搜集或利用原有的旧料和废料。有三十二个车站的给水设备都是就地取材和利用了废料修复的。已经修好的二百座大小桥梁的全部钢梁和其他材料，也都利用旧料、废料重新做成。有些钢梁损坏后不能用了，战士们就将它全部拆卸下来另行修补或者还原，然后再焊接在一起。
    中国人民志愿军铁道部队某部工程大队在修复几处江桥时，学习苏联修复桥梁的先进方法，把被敌机轰炸时震离位置好几公尺的桥墩，用机械拉回正位，然后在周围进行加固工程，节省了三百五十吨水泥。在线路的加固工程中，战士们搜集了很多炸坏了的钢轨，把它还原后作为备料，又把从便桥上换下来的枕木尽量用作架轨，使一些战时没有通车的线路也能迅速通车。
