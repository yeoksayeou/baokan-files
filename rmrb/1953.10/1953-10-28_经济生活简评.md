Brief Economic Commentary
    
    Resolutely Change the Situation Where Afforestation Cannot Keep Up with Logging
    
    With the large-scale development of national economic construction and the continuous improvement of people's production and life, the demand for timber is increasing day by day, and the area of forest logging has to be expanded year by year. However, many logged forest lands have not been reforested in time, and afforestation work cannot keep up with forest logging, which puts large areas of forest land at risk of becoming barren. For the long-term interests of national construction, this situation must be changed rapidly and effectively.
    
    In the past four years, under the correct leadership of the People's Government and the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, some areas have begun to implement the policy of rational logging, reversing the past predatory logging methods, and have initially carried out afforestation work. Since 1952, the Northeast region has begun to set up forest nurseries to cultivate seedlings, reduce seedling costs, increase seedling emergence rates, and solve the problem of mountain rodents harming direct seeding of Korean pine. Forest workers in the Southwest Branch of the Linjiang County in Liaodong Province created a method of planting larch in swamps, overcoming the difficulty of forest regeneration in swamps. Workers at the Sihaidian Forest Tending Station in Suiling County, Heilongjiang Province, created a three-person eye-to-eye manual planting method, which simplified work procedures, improved work quality, and reduced production costs. The Northeast provinces have all carried out forest farm cleanup work, not only clearing out a lot of usable timber (when the Japanese and puppets felled forests, they only picked the big and good ones to cut, and many usable trees were still left in the forest farm), but also cutting down and clearing diseased, rotten, dead, old trees, and branches and wastes left after logging that hinder the growth of young trees and the progress of regeneration, which can promote the natural regeneration of forests. According to a survey in Xiaodonggou, Wangqing County, Jilin Province: In the cleared forest land, 60 to 340 Korean pine saplings have grown in every 1,000 square meters of area.
    
    However, the afforestation work in various places, both in terms of quality and quantity, is far from meeting the objective requirements. Moreover, many areas did not thoroughly remove diseased and rotten trees in the forest when cleaning up the forest farm, and rarely carried out regeneration operations after cleaning up the forest farm. In addition, some fire-damaged areas have not been regenerated, and there are more barren forest lands.
    
    In addition, some forest industry departments have not effectively implemented the policy of rational logging. For example, the Liu Maohe forest area in Liaodong Province still implements "clear-cutting" logging. The logging rate in this forest area averages as high as 85 percent (according to regulations, it should not exceed 60 percent). They also leave diseased, rotten trees and mechanically damaged trees with low utilization value in the forest. These are all detrimental to forest regeneration.
    
    In the future, forest industry departments in various places must effectively implement the policy of rational logging, and clean up forest farms in conjunction with logging operations to promote natural forest regeneration and create favorable conditions for artificial regeneration.

    经济生活简评
    切实改变育林赶不上采伐的情况
    国家经济建设的大规模发展和人民生产和生活的不断上升，木材的需要量日益增加，采伐森林面积不能不逐年扩大。但采伐过的许多林地上未能及时培育新林，育林工作赶不上森林采伐工作，就使大面积的林地有荒芜的危险。为了国家建设的长远利益，必须迅速地切实地改变这种情况。
    四年来，在人民政府的正确领导和苏联专家的热情帮助下，有些地区已开始执行合理采伐的方针，扭转了过去掠夺性的采伐方式，并初步展开了育林工作。东北区从一九五二年起开始设置了林间苗圃培养树苗，降低了育苗成本，提高了出苗率，解决了红松直播招致山鼠危害的问题。辽东省临江县西南岔林业工人创造了在沼泽地播植落叶松的方法，克服了沼泽地森林更新的困难。黑龙江省绥棱县四海店森林抚育站工人创造了三人目比人工播植法，简化了工作手续，提高了工作质量，并降低了生产成本。东北各省都进行了清理林场工作，不但清理出来不少可以利用的木材（日伪时砍伐森林是专挑大的、好的砍，林场内仍留下很多尚可利用的林木），而且对有碍于幼树生长和进行更新的病腐树、枯死树、老龄树和采伐后剩下的枝梢废材也已砍伐清除，可以促进森林的天然更新。据在吉林省汪清县小东沟调查：在经过清理的林地上，每一千平方公尺面积内，已长出红松幼树六十至三百四十株。
    但是，各地的育林工作，不论在质和量方面，都远赶不上客观的要求。并且许多地区在清理林场时，并未将林内病腐树等彻底清除，清理林场后也很少接着进行更新作业。加以有些火灾迹地也没有进行更新，荒芜的林地就更多了。
    此外，部分森林工业部门，也没有切实地贯彻合理采伐的方针，如辽东省柳毛河林区，目前仍然实行“剃光头”式的采伐。这个林区的采伐率平均高达百分之八十五（按规定不得超过百分之六十）。对于利用价值较低的病腐树、机械损伤树等，也任其留在林子里。这些对于森林更新都是不利的。
    各地森林工业部门，今后必须切实执行合理采伐的方针，结合采伐作业，随即清理林场，以促进森林天然更新，并为人工更新创造有利条件。
