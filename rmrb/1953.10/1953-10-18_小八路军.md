"Little Eighth Route Army"
　　　Lu Zhenying
That was during the time of fighting the Japanese devils. My home was not far from the area occupied by the enemy.

One day, the district chief held a meeting and had dinner at my house. I climbed on his shoulders and rode him like a horse, wanting him to take me to join the Eighth Route Army. He said I wasn't grown up yet, and that I was too timid, so the Eighth Route Army wouldn't want me. He said it was okay that I wasn't grown up yet, but saying I was timid really angered me. I didn't say a word, slid off him, and lay listlessly on the kang, unable to sleep. I kept thinking, "Am I really that timid?"

Just as the sky was beginning to brighten, my mother got up. I heard a commotion in the street. She opened the door and saw people everywhere, some hiding things, some penning up cattle and sheep, and some going into dugouts. It turned out the village was surrounded by the Japanese devils. Then she remembered something: "Last night the district chief and a comrade didn't leave, and they stayed at Second Aunt's house in the backyard. They must not know the village is surrounded." She ran back into the house in three strides, and seeing me still sleeping on the kang, not moving, she pulled and shook me, shouting, "Get up! Get up! The village is surrounded by the Japanese devils!" I woke up from my dream and quickly got dressed upon hearing the Japanese devils were here. "Xiao Shuan! Quickly go to Second Aunt's house in the backyard and tell the district chief to come to our house to hide." I quickly ran to Second Aunt's house. Seeing the district chief and his comrade still sleeping, I pulled them up and went to my house. When my mother saw them coming, she quickly took out a set of civilian clothes from the wardrobe and had the district chief change into them.

Outside, the dogs barked louder and louder as the Japanese devils entered the village. They searched every house. There was no sound on the street, only the heavy sound of leather shoes. Suddenly, the door opened, and a group of Japanese soldiers and puppet police walked in. They stood angrily in front of my mother and said, "Everyone out!" The district chief pretended to be sick and lay on the kang. The Japanese devils lifted the quilt, and my mother pleaded with them, "Let him stay at home! He's sick and can't walk." The puppet soldier said, "Even if he's sick, he has to go out. Not one person can stay!"

All the men, women, and children in the village were driven to a large temple in the west of the village. It was surrounded by sentries, holding shining bayonets, standing there. On the left and right sides were machine guns, the blockade was virtually airtight. The Japanese devils lined up the men on one side, the women on one side, and the children in a line on another side. I was also pulled there to stand. My heart was pounding. Then, one of the Japanese devils took out a handful of candy from his pocket and gave it to us, wanting us to say who was the Eighth Route Army cadre. Some took the candy, some didn't, but no one said a word. Then the Japanese devil giving out candy came to me, grabbed a handful of candy and handed it to me. I glanced at him and didn't take it. The Japanese devil forced it into my hand. I was so angry that I threw the candy he put in my hand on the ground. The Japanese devil slapped me hard, making my ears ring, and gritting his teeth, he said, "You don't know what's good for you." At this time, another Japanese devil with glasses shouted loudly on the square, "Now take your fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters-in-law back. Whoever misidentifies will be killed."

Da Shui's father was taken away by him, and Haiwa also called his mother out. In the end, there were only a few people left. Originally, very few people in the village knew the district chief. Seeing that no one was taking the district chief away, my heart was in a chaotic mess, not knowing what to do. At this time, I saw my mother look at me, then at the district chief. My heart lit up, I straightened my chest, and walked to the district chief. When I got to him, I shouted, "Dad! Let's go home!" I pulled him, and then walked to the comrade and called him, "Uncle, let's go!" Finally, I grabbed my mother's clothes and said, "Mom! Let's go back!" As we were about to go back, a Japanese devil stopped us and asked, "Do you know them?" I said loudly, "I can't even recognize my dad! My mom! My uncle! If I'm wrong, kill me." In this way, we returned home safely. When I got home, I asked the district chief, "Can I join the Eighth Route Army now?" He touched my head and said with a smile, "You really are a little Eighth Route Army!"

    “小八路军”　　　
    陆振英
    那还是打日本鬼子的时期。我家离开敌人占领的地方不远。
    一天，区长开罢会，在我家吃晚饭。我爬在他肩上骑着耍，我要他带我去当八路军。他说我还没长大，胆子小，八路军不要我。他说我没长大还没啥，说我胆子小可把我气坏了。我一句话也没说，从他身上溜下来，没精打采地躺在炕上，怎也睡不着。老想：“我真胆小吗？”
    天刚麻麻亮，娘就爬起来了。听见街上闹哄哄的。她开开大门一看，到处是人，有的藏东西，有的圈牛羊，还有的钻地洞。原来村子被鬼子包围了。这时她想起一件事情：“昨晚上区长和一个工作同志没有走，住在后院二婶子家里。他们一定不知道鬼子包围村子啦。”她三步并成两步往屋里跑，进了房子，看见我还睡在炕上，动也不动。她连拉带摇的喊：“快起来！快起来，村子被鬼子包围住了！”我从梦中惊醒过来，听说鬼子来了，就赶快穿好衣服。“小拴！快去后院二婶子家告诉区长，叫他们来咱家躲躲。”我连忙拔腿就跑到二婶家。一见区长他们还在睡着，我把他们拉起来，就往我家里走。娘见他们来了，很快从衣柜里拿出一身便衣，让区长换上。
    外面狗汪汪汪地叫得越来越近，鬼子进村了。挨家挨户的在搜查。街上没有一点动静，只听见沉重的皮鞋声。忽然大门开了，走进来一群鬼子兵和伪警察。怒气冲冲的站在娘面前说：“统统都出去！”区长装了个病人躺在炕上。鬼子掀开被子，娘向他们央求说：“让他在家吧！有病不能走路。”伪军说：“有病也要出去，一个也不能留！”
    全村的男女老幼都被赶在村西的一个大庙里，四周布满了哨兵，端着明晃晃的刺刀，站在那里，左右两边是机关枪，封锁的简直是风雨不透。鬼子们把男人排在一边，女人排在一边，儿童也排成一队，站在一边。我也被拉到那里站着。我心里蹦蹦直跳，这时，有一个鬼子从衣袋里抓出一把糖来发给我们，想要我们说出那个人是八路军的干部。有的接了糖，有的没接，可是谁也没啃气。这时发糖的鬼子已走到我跟前，抓了一把糖递给我，我瞅了他一眼，没接他的，那个鬼子就硬往我手里塞，我心里直冒火，顺手就把他塞进来的糖摔在地上了。那鬼子狠狠地给了我一个耳光，打得我耳朵嗡嗡直叫，还咬着牙说：“不识好歹的东西。”这时，广场上另一个带眼镜的鬼子高声喊道：“现在把你们的父亲、母亲、哥哥、嫂嫂都领回去，谁要乱认，就杀谁的头。”
    大水把他爹认走了，海娃把他娘也叫出去了，最后剩下没有几个人了。本来村里认得区长的人就很少，我见区长没有人领，心里乱糟糟的搅成一团，不知怎样是好。这时，我见娘看看我，又看看区长，我心里一亮，把胸口一挺，就往区长跟前走，走到他面前就叫：“爹！跟我回去！”拉着他，又走到那个工作同志面前叫：“舅舅，走吧！”最后，抓住娘的衣服说：“娘！咱们回去吧！”我们正要往回走，一个鬼子拦住问我：“你认识他们吗？”我大声说：“我爹！我娘！我舅舅还认不得！要是错了杀我的头。”这样，我们就安全地回去了。回到家，我问区长：“我可以当八路军了吗？”他摸着我的头笑着说：“你真是个小八路军！”
