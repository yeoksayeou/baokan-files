Xinhua News Agency, October 13th:

    The granite stele stone, weighing hundreds of tons, required for the construction of the capital's "Monument to the People's Heroes," arrived in Beijing from Qingdao at 10:30 AM on the 13th. Over a hundred staff members of the Capital People's Heroes Monument Construction Committee and railway workers held a simple and warm ceremony at the station to welcome all the staff who escorted the large stone to Beijing.

    This large stone, weighing hundreds of tons, was transported to Beijing on a special train with a specially made flatcar capable of carrying ninety tons. During the transportation process, the workers displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, using "oil jacks," pulleys, rollers, iron frames, steel rails, sleepers, and tractors to move the stone from the mountainside to flat ground, and then from the mountain area to Qingdao Railway Station, which was thirty *hua li* away, before loading it onto the flatcar. The large stone was shipped on October 6th at 5:00 PM and safely arrived in Beijing on October 13th.

    Currently, the Capital People's Heroes Monument Construction Committee is finding ways to transport the large stone from the station to the construction site in Tiananmen Square. (Picture attached)

    首都“人民英雄纪念碑”碑身石料运到北京
    【新华社十三日讯】兴建首都“人民英雄纪念碑”所需的重达百吨的花岗石碑身石料，已于十三日上午十时半由青岛运抵北京。首都人民英雄纪念碑兴建委员会所属职工及铁路工作人员百余人，在车站上举行了简单热烈的仪式，欢迎护送大石料来京的全体工作人员。
    这块重达百吨的大石料是由特制的载重九十吨的大车皮专车运送来北京的。在搬运中，职工们曾发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，利用“油千斤”、滑轮、滚杠、铁架、钢轨、枕木以及拖拉机等工具，把石料从山上下落平地，又从山场运到相距三十华里的青岛车站，再装上车皮。大石料从十月六日下午五时启运，到十月十三日安全运抵北京。
    目前，首都人民英雄纪念碑兴建委员会正设法将大石料从车站运往天安门前广场工地。（附图片）
