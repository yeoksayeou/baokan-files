    Initial Successes in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
    Many Factories, Mines, and Transportation Departments Across the Country Overfulfill Their Plans
    [This Newspaper's Report] The increase production and practice economy campaign carried out by state-owned and local state-owned factories, mines, and railway transportation departments in various regions has achieved initial results. Many units have overfulfilled their plans for September or the third quarter.
    In September, national state-owned coal mines completed 115.8 percent of the state coal production plan. Total coal production increased by 10.1 percent compared to August, and average labor productivity increased by 10 percent compared to the plan. In the national iron and steel industry, most of the factories and mines under the Anshan Iron and Steel Company overfulfilled the production increase plans for September. Among the fourteen major products produced by the Iron Smelting Plant, Medium Rolling Mill, Small Rolling Mill, and Steel Pipe Plant, ten products overfulfilled the production increase plans. The largest increase was in medium steel. The excess portion of this steel reached 16 percent of the production increase plan. The Medium Rolling Mill, Small Rolling Mill, Medium Plate Plant, Ore Dressing Plant, First Thin Plate Plant, and Metal Products Plant also completed the third quarter national production plans six to ten days ahead of schedule. Benxi Iron and Steel Company also overfulfilled the September production plans for thirteen major products, including pig iron, steel, steel products, and coke. The eight factories of the East China Iron and Steel Company completed the third quarter steel and steel production plans ahead of schedule. The total steel production in September exceeded the plan by 9.06 percent, and steel products exceeded the plan by 11.59 percent. Among them, the Shanghai Steel Plant's wheels, steel, horseshoe iron, and other five products all exceeded the plan by 20 percent. The plant completed the original annual production value plan ahead of schedule on September 27. The various factories and mines under the Shandong Mining and Metallurgical Office of the Central Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau all overfulfilled their September product plans. Tangshan Steel Plant completed the third quarter national plan three days ahead of schedule. The quality of major products such as steel ingots and steel products all reached quality indicators, and the consumption of major raw materials was lower than the quota. Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant overfulfilled the September production plan, and the electric furnace steelmaking department completed the September national plan seven days ahead of schedule. Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant also overfulfilled the third quarter plan at the end of September, and No. 2 blast furnace created the highest daily output record of pig iron since the plant was built. The national railway system completed 105.2 percent of the loading task in September, and the transportation quality was also good. The planned material transportation increased by 3.8 percent compared to August, and the vehicle turnaround rate was shortened by 0.03 days compared to the plan. The yarn and cloth production of the state-owned textile industry in the third quarter exceeded the plan, changing the situation that yarn and cloth production had to decline in the summer in previous years. In the third quarter of this year, the cotton yarn production of state-owned and joint state-private cotton textile mills exceeded the plan by 2.46 percent, and cotton cloth production exceeded the plan by 1.25 percent, producing approximately 68.28 million meters more cloth than in the third quarter of last year. The quality of yarn and cloth has also remained stable. Most textile factories have been able to complete their production plans on a ten-day and monthly basis.
    Since the launch of the increase production and practice economy campaign, the production situation of many factories and mines has been good, and the number of units completing plans in various regions is increasing day by day. The main products of state-owned factories and mines in Fushun City, such as raw coal, steel ingots, rolled steel products, cement, electrical porcelain, oil shale, crude oil, gasoline, paraffin wax, metallurgical coke, sulfuric acid, and ammonium sulfate, all overfulfilled the September production plan. Except for steel ingots and steel products, other products completed the third quarter plan one to twelve days ahead of schedule. In Tianjin, 74 state-owned and local state-owned factories completed their production plans in September. This is the best month for industrial production in Tianjin this year. In Shanxi Province, 40 factories and mining enterprises overfulfilled the September plan, including power plants in Datong and Yangquan, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, Shanxi Machinery Factory, Taiyuan Cement Plant, and eleven light industrial factories such as knitting, woolen, leather, flour, and match factories. In September, most factories in Shanghai overfulfilled their production plans. According to statistics from 116 factories, 100 factories overfulfilled the September production value plan or output plan. The major industrial sectors of the Northwest region, such as textiles, electricity, and petroleum, all overfulfilled their original production increase and practice economy plans in September. Twenty-five larger factories in Xi'an completed or overfulfilled the September production plan, of which ten factories comprehensively completed the plan in terms of output, quality, and cost. The transportation department in Xi'an also overfulfilled the September plan by 3 percent. In Tangshan, in addition to Tangshan Steel Plant, 15 other major factories and mines completed or overfulfilled the plan. Enterprises in Jiangxi Province that completed the September or third quarter plans ahead of schedule include more than ten units such as the Nanchang Transportation Sub-bureau of the Guangzhou Railway Administration, Jiangxi Chemical Plant, Jiangxi Match Factory, and Zhonglian Tobacco Factory. Factories and mines that completed the September or third quarter national production plans ahead of schedule also include Benxi Ore Dressing Plant, Longyan Iron Mine Mining Department, Chongqing 102 Plant Forging Workshop, Huaibei Salt Field, and Acheng Instrument Factory.
    The achievement of these results is inseparable from the increase production and practice economy campaign. In September, factories and mines across the country successively launched labor competitions. Workers actively sought out tricks, improved equipment, and improved operating methods, thereby breaking through the original production quotas. Some units seized the central link of improving enterprise management and launched mass competitions, which played a role in promoting the early completion of the September or third quarter production plans. For example, the electric furnace steelmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, focusing on establishing a responsibility system, learning from Soviet advanced experience, and strengthening maintenance, proposed the slogan of "comprehensively, evenly, and safely completing the production plan on a daily basis" to achieve "daily red" throughout the month and overfulfill the national plan. After the start of the competition, the smelting time of a certain furnace was shortened from 6 hours and 42 minutes to less than 6 hours and 30 minutes, and on September 22, a new melting record of 2 hours and 25 minutes and a new record for the highest daily output since the start of the furnace (exceeding the highest daily output record in August by 1.59 percent) were created. Starting from September 1, the department completely achieved the goal of completing the work plan evenly on a daily basis, and the qualified rate of steel ingots increased by 2.4 percent compared to the national standard.

    增产节约运动获初步成效
    全国许多厂矿和运输部门超额完成计划
    【本报讯】各地国营和地方国营厂矿及铁道运输部门开展的增产节约运动已获初步成效，许多单位超额完成了九月份或第三季度计划。
    九月份全国国营煤矿完成国家产煤计划百分之一百一十五点八，煤炭总产量比八月份实际增加了百分之十点一，平均劳动生产率比计划提高了百分之十。在全国钢铁工业中，鞍山钢铁公司所属大部分厂矿超额完成了九月份的增产计划。其中炼铁厂、中型轧钢厂、小型轧钢厂、钢管厂等生产的十四种主要产品中，有十种产品超额完成了增产计划。增产最多的是中型钢材。这种钢材的超额部分达到了增产计划的百分之十六。中型轧钢厂、小型轧钢厂、中板厂、选矿厂、第一薄板厂及金属制品厂并提前六至十一天完成了第三季度国家生产计划。本溪钢铁公司的生铁、钢、钢材、焦炭等十三种主要产品也都超额完成了九月份生产计划。华东钢铁公司八个厂，第三季度钢和钢材的产量计划都已提前完成。九月份钢的总产量超额百分之九点零六，钢材超额百分之十一点五九。其中新沪钢铁厂车轮、钢材、马铁等五种产品都超额百分之二十完成了计划。该厂在九月二十七日已提前完成了原订的全年生产总值计划。中央钢铁工业管理局山东矿冶办事处所属各厂矿，九月份各项产品计划都超额完成。唐山钢厂提前三天完成了第三季度国家计划，主要产品质量如钢锭、钢材都达到了质量指标，主要原材料消耗都低于定额。太原钢铁厂超额完成了九月份生产计划，电炉炼钢部提前七天完成了九月份国家计划。石景山钢铁厂在九月底也超额完成了第三季度计划，二号高炉创造了建厂以来的生铁日产量最高纪录。全国铁路系统，九月份完成装车任务百分之一百零五点二，运输质量也较好，计划内的物资运输比八月份提高百分之三点八，车辆周转率比计划缩短零点零三天。国营纺织工业第三季度的纱布产量都超过计划，改变了历年来夏季纱布生产都要下降的状况。今年第三季度国营和公私合营棉纺织厂的棉纱产量超额百分之二点四六，棉布产量超额百分之一点二五，比去年第三季度大约多生产了六千八百二十八万公尺的布。纱布质量也保持稳定。大多数纺织工厂已能做到按旬、按月地完成生产计划。
    增产节约运动展开以来，许多厂矿的生产情况良好，各地完成计划的单位日益增加。抚顺市国营厂矿的原煤、钢锭、钢压延品、水泥、电瓷、油页岩、原油、汽油、石蜡、冶金焦、硫酸，硫铵等主要产品都超额完成了九月份生产计划，除钢锭和钢材外，其他产品都提前一天到十二天完成了第三季度计划。天津市九月份有七十四个国营和地方国营工厂完成了生产计划。这是天津今年以来工业生产情况最好的一个月。山西省超额完成九月份计划的有四十个厂矿企业，其中包括大同、阳泉等地的发电厂、太原矿山机器厂、山西机器厂、太原水泥厂等单位和针织、毛织、皮革、面粉、火柴等十一个轻工业工厂。九月份，上海市大部分工厂都超额完成了生产计划。根据一百十六个工厂的统计，其中超额完成九月份生产总值计划或产量计划的，就有一百个工厂。西北区纺织、电业、石油等主要产业部门九月份都超额完成了原订增产节约计划。西安市有二十五个较大工厂完成或超额完成了九月份生产计划，其中有十个工厂在产量、质量、成本方面全面完成了计划。西安市的交通运输部门也超额完成九月份计划百分之三。唐山市除唐山钢厂外，还有十五个主要厂矿完成或超额完成了计划。江西省提前完成九月份或第三季度计划的企业，计有广州铁路管理局南昌运输分局、江西化工厂、江西火柴厂、中联烟厂等十多个单位。提前完成九月份或第三季度国家生产计划的厂矿，还有本溪选矿厂、龙烟铁矿采矿部、重庆一○二厂煅造场、淮北盐场、阿城仪表厂等单位。
    这些成绩的取得是与增产节约运动分不开的。九月里，全国各地厂矿陆续展开劳动竞赛，职工们纷纷找窍门，改善设备，改进操作方法，从而突破了原来的生产定额。有些单位抓住了改进企业经营管理的中心环节，发动群众展开竞赛，对于提前完成九月份或第三季度生产计划起了推动作用。如太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部以建立责任制、学习苏联先进经验、加强维护等工作为中心，提出了“全面地、均衡地、安全地按日完成生产计划”，做到全月
    “日日红”，超额完成国家计划的口号。竞赛开始后，某号炉的冶炼时间由六时四十二分钟缩短到六时三十分钟以下，并在九月二十二日创造了二点二十五分钟的熔化新纪录和开炉以来的最高日产新纪录（超过八月份最高日产纪录百分之一点五九）。从九月一日开始，该部完全做到了按日均衡地完成作业计划，钢锭合格率比国家规定指标提高了百分之二点四。
