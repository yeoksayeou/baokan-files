Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 12th. “Rodong Sinmun” and “Minju Choson” here both published editorials on the 12th, supporting the two statements issued by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on the notification from the U.S. government regarding the Korean political conference issue.

“Rodong Sinmun” published an editorial entitled “A Just Proposal for the Prompt Convocation of the Korean Political Conference,” stating: The two statements issued by the Korean and Chinese sides are the most appropriate measures to seek the prompt convocation of the Korean political conference. This once again clarifies the consistent peaceful policy and position of the Korean and Chinese governments and clearly demonstrates the firm will to ensure the success of the Korean political conference. The Korean people fully support these two statements.

The editorial emphasized: The U.S. government must, based on the specific proposals put forward by the Korean and Chinese governments, promptly conduct talks with representatives appointed by the Korean and Chinese governments on the issue of the Korean political conference to resolve the venue and time of the Korean political conference, especially the issue of conference membership. The issue of the composition of the political conference is the most important issue to ensure the success of the conference and must be resolved. If, as the U.S. intends, the members of the political conference are limited to the belligerent parties, then this will be a repetition of the Panmunjom armistice negotiations and can only lead to a situation where the aggressors can unilaterally undermine the political conference. In particular, because the Korean political conference will resolve important issues directly related to consolidating peace in Asia and the world, such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea, the Soviet Union and all Asian countries concerned with the political conference must be widely allowed to participate. The U.S. side has no basis or excuse to oppose and obstruct this. All the Korean people, together with the people of the world, unanimously demand that the U.S. government fully accept the propositions stated in the statements of Foreign Minister Nam Il and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and promptly conduct talks on the issue of the political conference based on them.

“Minju Choson” published an editorial entitled “The Sincere Efforts of the Korean and Chinese Peoples for the Prompt Convocation of the Korean Political Conference,” stating: More than seventy days have passed since the Korean armistice was realized, and the date for the convocation of the political conference is imminent. However, the necessary conditions for convening the political conference have not yet been met, and the issue of conference membership has not been reasonably resolved. The various activities of the United States at the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly have made it even clearer that the United States lacks sincerity in convening a political conference. The editorial pointed out: Regardless of the lack of sincerity on the part of the United States, the Korean and Chinese governments have issued statements, agreeing to hold talks with U.S. representatives in Panmunjom on the issue of the political conference. These two statements further put forward constructive proposals, which will surely be warmly supported by peace-loving people all over the world. If the U.S. side truly wants a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, it must show its sincerity in promptly convening a political conference and accept our proposal as soon as possible.

### 朝鲜“劳动新闻”和“民主朝鲜报”发表社论  支持周恩来外长和南日外务相的声明

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”和“民主朝鲜报”发表社论
    支持周恩来外长和南日外务相的声明
    【新华社平壤十二日电】此间“劳动新闻”和“民主朝鲜报”都在十二日发表社论，支持中华人民共和国中央人民政府周恩来外交部长和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府南日外务相就美国政府关于朝鲜政治会议问题的通知所发表的两个声明。
    “劳动新闻”以“为了迅速召开朝鲜政治会议的正当提案”为题发表社论说：朝中方面发表的两个声明，是谋求朝鲜政治会议迅速召开的最适当的措施。这再一次阐明了朝中两国政府一贯的和平政策与立场，并清楚地显示了促使朝鲜政治会议取得成功的坚韧意志。朝鲜人民完全支持这两个声明。
    社论着重说：美国政府必须根据朝中两国政府所提出的具体建议，与朝、中两国政府指派的代表一起迅速进行关于朝鲜政治会议问题的会谈，来解决召开朝鲜政治会议的地点和时间，特别是会议成员的问题。政治会议的成员问题，是保证会议成功的最重要的问题，必须获得解决。如果，仍按照美国的企图，把政治会议的成员局限于交战双方，那么，这就是板门店停战谈判的重复，只能招致使侵略者得以片面地破坏政治会议的结果。特别是因为朝鲜政治会议将要解决从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队问题、和平统一朝鲜问题等与巩固亚洲及世界和平有着直接关联的重要问题，所以必须广泛地让苏联及亚洲所有关心政治会议的国家参加。美方没有任何根据和藉口可以加以反对和阻挠。全体朝鲜人民和全世界人民一道，一致要求美国政府全部接受南日外务相和周恩来外交部长声明中所述的主张，并以它为基础迅速进行关于政治会议问题的会谈。
    “民主朝鲜报”以“朝中两国人民为迅速召开朝鲜政治会议的诚挚努力”为题发表社论说：朝鲜停战实现到现在已有七十多天了，召开朝鲜政治会议的日期近在眼前。但是，召开政治会议的必要条件到今天还没有具备，首先是会议成员问题没有获得合理解决。而美国在联合国第八届大会上的种种活动却更加清楚地表明了美国对召开政治会议缺乏诚意。社论指出：朝中两国政府不顾美国的缺乏诚意，已分别发表声明，同意在板门店和美国代表举行关于政治会议问题的会谈。这两个声明进一步提出了建设性的提议，必将受到全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持。美方如果真正愿意和平解决朝鲜问题，那就必须表明迅速召开政治会议的诚意，早日接受我方的提议。
