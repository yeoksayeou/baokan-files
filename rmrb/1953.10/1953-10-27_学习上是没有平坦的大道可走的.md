    Learning has no smooth road.
    Lu Yaodong
    The motherland is like the sunshine of spring, warming people's hearts. Tens of thousands of young people are growing up under its illumination.
    In the old society, if a poor peasant's child could recognize a few characters and remember the accounts, that was already a very high ideal. Comrade Li Jimin was born in such a poor family. In 1943, he had just finished the first semester of junior high school when he dropped out of school because he had no money. It was hard for him to get through those days of half-starvation. After liberation, he seemed like grass that had been broken by the severe cold, growing vigorously under the sunshine of spring. In 1947, he joined the revolutionary work.
    The motherland is facing a new historical task - large-scale economic construction. In order to cultivate Comrade Li Jimin, the leadership decided to transfer him to Wuhan University to study. For Comrade Li Jimin, this was an arduous task.
    In class, the teacher lectured for a long time, but he didn't understand anything, even what the plus and minus signs in mathematics were. In the first test, his scores in mathematics, physics, and chemistry were all zero. After class, when he picked up the book to review, he often encountered great difficulties. He had no choice but to ask his classmates and teachers for help. Once, a classmate explained the structural formula of water in chemistry to him, and he explained it several times in one breath, but Comrade Li Jimin still didn't understand. He asked, "What exactly is 'H'? What is 'O'?" The classmate said in surprise, "Comrade! You are at this level!" The implication was: "How can you learn?" At that time, Comrade Li Jimin was very sad, his face turning red and white. He thought: although he had encountered some difficulties in his work, it was never so frustrating. Should he go back to his original agency? This was a cowardly and wrong idea. At this time, he thought of what a comrade had said to him when he left the agency: "Don't come back because you can't keep up!" Yes, "coming back" was a disgraceful thing, it was like a soldier falling behind on the battlefield for no reason. He dared not, and did not want to think about it any further. He also remembered the speech of the leader when he left, thought of the story of Maksim, and thought of the inscriptions of comrades on his diary: "Dear comrade, tomorrow will be better than today, the happy and beautiful future is not far away, but without our efforts, all this will become an illusion. There are many difficulties in front of you, I hope you will not be intimidated by the difficulties, you must find a way to overcome it!" This was not only the hope of a few comrades for him, but also the hope of the motherland and the people for him. He thought: Zhang Jihui and Zhao Baotong had not read much when they were young, but after hard study, they mastered modern technology and became combat heroes. Countless young people from workers and peasants use their spare time to study cultural knowledge, and can recognize two or three thousand characters in one or two months, can read popular books and newspapers, and can write letters to Chairman Mao. Did they encounter fewer difficulties than me? In his diary that day, he wrote: "Learning is not only my personal problem, but also a task assigned to me by the organization. Difficulties are a test for me. I will never shrink back in the face of difficulties, I will persevere in learning."
    Although there were many things he could not understand in class, Comrade Li Jimin never let it go lightly. If there was anything he didn't understand, he would write it down and ask his classmates after class. For example, when studying the three basic formulas of motion in physics, he felt great difficulty, so he asked his classmates and teachers again and again to thoroughly understand them. He understood that there is no smooth road in learning, only those who are not afraid of hardship and danger can reach the brilliant peak. In learning, he tried to connect theoretical knowledge with the phenomena of daily life to help him remember. In this way, after a short period of time, he gradually caught up. Although he still had great difficulty in previewing before class, he could concentrate on listening to the lectures, and after class, he studied according to every bit of what the teacher said. In this way, he made steady progress. From the beginning of last semester, he was able to preview before class, and he was able to grasp the key points in listening to the lectures; in the final exam, his scores in physics, analytic geometry, and trigonometry were all above ninety, and his average score reached eighty-seven. He said to his classmates: "Now, I have developed a strong interest in learning." Indeed, this was a huge gain for him in learning, but this gain was achieved after a long period of patient cultivation.

    学习上是没有平坦的大道可走的
    陆耀东
    祖国像春天的阳光，温暖着人们的心。成千成万的青年在它的照耀下成长起来。
    在旧社会里，一个贫农的孩子，如果能识得几个字，记得上账，那已是很高的理想了。李济民同学就是在这样的贫困家庭里生长的。一九四三年他刚念完初中二上，就因没钱上学而失了学，好容易才熬过了那些半饥半饱的日子。解放以后，他好像是曾被严寒摧折了的草，在春天阳光的照耀下，蓬蓬勃勃地茁长起来。一九四七年他参加了革命工作。
    祖国面临着新的历史任务——大规模经济建设，领导方面为了培养李济民同学，决定调他到武汉大学学习。对于李济民同学来说，这是一个艰巨的任务。
    上课时，老师讲了半天，他一点也不懂，甚至连什么是数学上的正负号也说不出来。第一次测验，数学、物理、化学的成绩都是零分。下课后，他拿起书来温习时，也往往碰到很大困难。他没有办法，就只好请教同学和老师。一次，一个同学给他讲化学上水的构造方程式，一口气就讲了几遍，李济民同学还是不明白。他问：“到底‘H’是什么？‘O’是什么？”那位同学惊奇地说：“同志！你是这样的程度呀！”意思就是说：“你怎么能学得下去啊！”当时李济民同学十分难过，脸上一阵红，一阵白。他想：在工作中虽然也遇到过某些困难，但总没有这样令人恼火。回原机关去吗？这是一种懦弱的错误的想法。这时，他想到在离开机关时一位同志对他说过的话：“你可不要因为赶不上班而退回来！”是的，“退回来”是一件不光彩的事，那等于一个战士在战场上无故掉了队。他不敢、也不愿再往这里想下去。他也记起了首长在离开时的讲话，想到马克辛的故事，想到同志们在他的日记本上的题字：“亲爱的同志，明天一定比今天好，幸福美好的将来并不遥远，但是如果没有我们的努力奋斗，这一切都会成为幻影。在你面前有着许多的困难，希望你不要被困难所吓倒，一定要设法克服它！”这不仅是几个同志对他的希望，而且是祖国、人民对他的希望。他想到：张积慧、赵宝桐小时没念过多少书，但经过努力学习，掌握了现代化的技术，并且成了战斗英雄。无数工农出身的青年利用业余时间学习文化知识，在一、二个月内就能认识二、三千字，会读通俗书报，会写信给毛主席。难道他们遇到的困难比我少吗？在当天的日记上，他这样地写着：“学习不单是我个人的问题，而是组织方面给我的任务。困难就是对我的考验。我决不在困难面前退缩，我要坚持学习下去。”
    虽然在课堂上有很多的东西听不懂，但李济民同学决不轻轻地把它放过去。有不懂的地方，他就把它记下来，下课后再去问同学。例如在学习物理学中关于运动的三个基本公式时，他感到很大的困难，他就一次再次地问同学，问老师，彻底把它们搞清楚。他懂得在学习上是没有平坦的大道可走的，只有不畏劳苦、不畏险阻的人，才能达到光辉的顶点。在学习中，他尽可能地把理论知识和日常生活中的现象联系起来考虑，借以帮助记忆。这样，经过一个短时期后，他逐渐赶上了。虽然在课前预习中仍有很大困难，但他能专心听讲，在课后并根据老师讲的一点一滴地进行学习。这样，他便稳步地前进了。从上学期开始，他在课前也能作预习了，听课也能抓住重心；期终考试，物理、解析几何、三角等科成绩都在九十分以上，平均分数达八十七分。他对同学们说：“现在，我已对学习发生了浓厚的兴趣。”的确，这是他在学习上的一个巨大收获，但这个收获是经过长时期的耐心耕耘才取得的。
