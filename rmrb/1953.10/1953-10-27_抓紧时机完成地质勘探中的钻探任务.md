In the past six months, the drilling teams in geological exploration have grown rapidly. Under the call of the motherland, all employees, in order to provide the country's economic construction with accurate resource data, have overcome various difficulties such as inconvenient transportation and lack of water sources and housing. They have simultaneously prepared for construction and rapidly organized construction. In the past six months, the number of operating drilling rigs has increased nearly fourfold compared to the end of last year, and the number of drilling employees has increased more than eightfold, with some units increasing more than tenfold. In the intense construction, the average completion rate of drilling footage tasks in the first half of the year was 80%. Some key teams exceeded their footage tasks in both the first and second quarters. The average core recovery rate in the second quarter reached 63.95%, with some key teams averaging 73.3%. The average net drilling time utilization rate was 19.12% in the first quarter and 21.46% in the second quarter, with some key teams reaching 29.77%. All field teams have achieved certain successes and gained experience in promoting advanced experiences, improving technology, establishing production management systems, and improving operations. Judging from the current situation, several key teams can basically complete the state's drilling tasks on schedule and deliver the resource data necessary for economic construction.

1953 is a year of great development for drilling work. Looking back on the past six months, we have traveled a difficult road. At the beginning of the first quarter, except for Team 321 and Team 429, other key teams of the Central Geological Department, such as Team 241 and the Chaling Geological Exploration Team of the Central South Geological Bureau, were expanded from the basis of three drilling rigs last year. At that time, it was necessary to prepare for construction and rapidly organize construction, absorbing many employees to participate in the establishment of organizations, construction, material preparation, transportation, installation, and other work. It was not until the beginning of the second quarter that the organizational and material equipment foundation commensurate with the national task was largely established. At this time, the main problem was the lack of experience and systems in production management. On the other hand, the vast majority of workers were newly recruited apprentices. Some teams, apart from the machine chiefs and squad leaders, could not find a single skilled worker, and more than 90% of the machine chiefs and squad leaders had never operated the new Soviet-style drilling rigs. These two situations caused chaos in production, resulting in poor efficiency, low quality, and frequent accidents. The Central Geological Department, the major regional geological bureaus, and the local geological exploration teams sent people to the construction sites to inspect and assist in the work, enabling the leadership to grasp the situation more thoroughly, summarize and absorb some experiences, and make preliminary regulations on certain production management and various systems, pushing the drilling work forward. The Central Geological Department also initially summarized the situation of the teams and formulated drilling technical operating procedures and systems such as shift handover system, responsibility system, reward and punishment system, and safety regulations, initially forming a set of norms in production management and technical operation. Currently, all field teams are vigorously implementing these regulations and systems, and making necessary revisions in light of local conditions to guide drilling work more practically.

After the beginning of the second quarter, the teams focused on promoting advanced Soviet experiences such as mud drilling, single sand injection, and rapid drilling to improve drilling efficiency, ensure quality, and reduce accidents. However, due to the lack of professional knowledge among the leadership and insufficient understanding and appreciation of advanced Soviet experiences, there was great blindness in the promotion, limited to general verbal appeals, without systematically mobilizing and educating employees to break the old set of one-on-one teaching methods, and without drawing experience from key promotions, a universal promotion was launched at once, resulting in many problems. Due to insufficient understanding of advanced experience, some adopted a perfunctory attitude, using mud during the day and clear water at night. Some understood single sand injection as a large amount of sand injection, the more the better, regardless of rock hardness and drill bit diameter. Team 241, Hole 22, injected 30 to 35 kilograms of sand at one time in grade 7 rock, resulting in a large consumption of materials and wear of drilling tools. At the beginning of using mud drilling, the vast majority was also substandard. The workers said: "This is not yellow mud, it is yellow mud soup." Many teams did not select the appropriate clay quality, and the equipment was not up to standard. Team 241 had four boreholes with stuck drill accidents due to this. The occurrence of such problems in the promotion of advanced experience has further caused some employees to resist advanced experience. In June and July, after inspection and instructions from Soviet experts, the team leaders took the necessary measures to overcome the chaotic phenomenon caused by the blind promotion of advanced experience, and achieved certain results. Team 641 used standard mud and three drilling rigs successfully passed through the complex oxidation zone formation. The 20-meter collapse of Hole 9 in Team 321, the 40-meter collapse of Hole 12 in Team 241, and the quicksand layer of Hole 44 were safely passed through due to the mud. The Chaling team used single sand injection more accurately based on the rock hardness and drill bit diameter, and the drilling efficiency was greatly improved, and it has been steadily rising for several months. The leadership has also gained certain experience in promoting advanced experience.

Although the drilling work in geological exploration has achieved certain results, we must not relax the leadership of the drilling work because of this. We must grasp the main links at any time to check and supervise, and we should not ignore the current situation of many accidents, low quality, and therefore low efficiency in drilling work. In particular, we must fully estimate that the time to complete this year's task is very tight. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, some drilling units will enter winter operation, which will add new difficulties to the work. In order to complete this year's task, especially to complete the key tasks, we must be consistent from top to bottom and rely on the unremitting efforts of all employees. Otherwise, if the leadership is relaxed or complacent and thinks that the problem is not big, even if there is an existing foundation and conditions for completing the task, there is still a risk of not completing the task on schedule. In the past, it was necessary and correct to grasp the drilling work from top to bottom. In the future, we must not relax the leadership of the drilling work because we want to strengthen the leadership of geological work.

In order to complete the drilling task in 1953, in the next few months, we should closely rely on employees, strengthen production management and technical management, improve quality, improve efficiency, promote advanced experience step by step, and reduce accidents. The specific methods are: First, mobilize employees to adjust the allocation of labor force, put the main force in the drilling teams that must be completed and some important drilling rigs, and further explain to them the tasks that must be completed in these months, help them formulate specific implementation plans, point out the key to completing the task, and predict the difficulties after entering winter to prepare early. Second, strictly implement production management, and earnestly implement the division of labor system, responsibility system, and inspection system. Third, combine with the actual situation in operation, implement technical operating procedures in stages, overcome empiricism and the erroneous ideas of not operating according to regulations, pursuing footage, and ignoring quality. Fourth, promote the advanced experience of mud drilling with preparation, step by step, and resolutely; implement the single sand injection method according to rock properties and drill bit specifications. Oppose blindness in promoting advanced experience. Fifth, organize experience exchange, and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of employees in production management and technical operation.

    抓紧时机完成地质勘探中的钻探任务
    中央地质部探矿工程司副司长  李轩
    半年多来，地质勘探中的钻探队伍迅速成长起来。全体职工在祖国的号召下，为供给国家的经济建设以准确的资源资料，克服了交通不便，缺乏水源与住房等各种困难，一面筹备工地建设，一面迅速组织施工。半年来，开动的钻机比去年年底增加了将近四倍，钻探职工增加到八倍以上，有些单位的职工增加到十倍以上。在紧张的施工中，上半年平均完成钻探进尺任务百分之八十，某些重点队第一季度和第二季度都超额完成了进尺任务。岩心采取率第二季度平均达到百分之六十三点九五，某些重点队平均达到百分之七十三点三，纯钻进时间利用率第一季度平均为百分之十九点十二，第二季度平均为百分之二十一点四六，某些重点队达到百分之二十九点七七，各野外队在推广先进经验，提高技术，建立生产管理制度，改善操作等问题上都取得一定的成绩和经验。从目前情况看，几个重点队基本上都可按期完成国家的钻探任务，交出经济建设所必要的资源资料。
    一九五三年是钻探工作大发展的一年。回顾这半年多来，我们走过一条艰难的道路。第一季度开始时，除三二一队、四二九队外，其他中央地质部二四一队，中南地质局茶陵地质勘探队等重点队，都是由去年三台钻机的基础上扩大起来的。当时一面要筹备工地建设，一面要迅速组织施工，吸收了许多职工参加建立组织，工地建设，备料，运输，安装等工作。直到第二季度开始时，才大体上建立了与国家任务相适应的组织与物质设备的基础。这时主要的问题是缺乏生产管理的经验和制度；另一方面工人绝大部分是新吸收的学工，有些队除了机长和班长以外，找不出一个熟练工，而机长和班长中有百分之九十以上从来没有操作过苏联的新式钻机。这两种情况便造成生产中的混乱，以致效率差，质量低，事故多。中央地质部，各大区地质局和各地质勘探队根据这个情况，曾分别派人赴各工地检查与协助工作，使领导方面更多的掌握情况，总结与吸取了一些经验，作了某些生产管理和各种制度的初步规定，把钻探工作向前推进了一步。中央地质部并初步总结了各队的情况，订出钻探技术操作规程与交接班制、责任制、奖惩制、保安条例等制度，在生产管理上和技术操作上初步形成了一套规范。目前各野外队正大力贯彻这些规程和制度，并结合各地情况进行必要的修正，使其更切合实际地指导钻探工作。
    第二季度开始后，各队曾着重推广了泥浆钻进，一次投砂，快速钻进等苏联先进经验，以提高钻进效率，保证质量和减少事故。但由于领导上缺乏业务知识，对苏联先进经验认识与体会不够，在推广中存在很大的盲目性，只限于口头上的一般号召，没有系统地动员和教育职工，打破一个师傅一个传授的老一套的操作方法，也没有从重点推广中去吸取经验，一下子就普遍推广，以致发生许多问题。由于对先进经验认识不足，有的就采取应付态度，白天用泥浆，夜晚用清水。有的把一次投砂理解为大量投砂，越多越好，就不管岩石硬度与钻头直径大小。二四一队二十二孔在七级岩石中一次投砂三十公斤至三十五公斤，造成材料的大量消耗与钻具的磨损。开始使用泥浆钻进时，绝大部分也是不合规格的，工人说：“这不是黄泥浆，是黄泥汤。”许多队粘土质量选择不当，设备不合规格，
    二四一队有四个钻孔因此发生卡钻事故。由于推广先进经验中发生这样一些问题，更造成一些职工对先进经验的抵触。到六、七月份，经过检查和苏联专家的指示，各队领导上采取了必要的措施，才克服了盲目推广先进经验所造成的混乱现象，并取得一定成绩。六四一队使用了合乎标准的泥浆，有三台钻机都顺利穿过了复杂的氧化带地层，三二一队九号孔二十多公尺的坍陷，二四一队十二号孔四十多公尺的坍陷和四十四孔的流砂层，都因泥浆作用而安全穿过，茶陵队根据岩石硬度和钻头直径大小，较正确地采用了一次投砂，钻进效率大大提高，而且几个月来一直平稳上升。领导方面对推广先进经验也已取得一定经验。
    地质勘探中的钻探工作虽已取得一定成绩，但绝不能因此而松懈对钻探工作的领导，要随时抓紧主要环节加以检查督促，而且更不应该忽视当前钻探工作中事故多，质量低，因而效率不高的情况，特别是要充分估计到完成今年任务的时间已经十分紧迫，第四季度开始，某些钻探单位将进入冬季操作，更增加了工作中的新的困难。为完成今年的任务，特别是要完成重点任务，还必须上下一致，依靠全体职工作毫不松懈的努力。否则，领导松弛或认为问题不大而麻痹自满，那么即使有现成的基础和完成任务的条件，仍有不能按期完成任务的危险。过去，从上到下的抓紧钻探工作是必要的、正确的，今后，也决不能因为要加强对地质工作的领导，而放松对钻探工作的领导。
    为完成一九五三年的钻探任务，今后几个月中应紧紧依靠职工，加强生产管理与技术管理，提高质量，提高效率，有步骤地推广先进经验，减少事故。具体作法是：第一、动员职工调整劳动力的配备，把主力放在必须完成的钻探分队和某些重要钻机上去，并进一步向他们说明这几个月中必须完成的任务，帮助他们订出具体执行计划，指出完成任务的关键，预察入冬后的困难以早作准备。第二、严格生产管理，切实执行分工制、责任制与检查制。第三、结合操作中的实际情况，分段贯彻技术操作规程，克服经验主义与不按规章操作和追求进尺，忽视质量的错误思想。第四、有准备、有步骤地，并坚决地推广泥浆钻进先进经验；按岩石性质，钻头规格施行一次投砂法。反对推广先进经验中的盲目性。第五、组织经验交流，发挥职工在生产管理与技术操作上的积极性和创造性。
