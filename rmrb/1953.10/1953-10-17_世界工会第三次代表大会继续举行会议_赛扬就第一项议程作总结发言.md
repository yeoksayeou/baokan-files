Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, October 16th: The Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions continued its discussion of Saillant's report at the morning session on the 14th. The meeting was chaired by Indian representative Dange.

Lebanese representative Elias Habr spoke about the difficult living conditions of Lebanese workers. He pointed out that the main reason was that the Lebanese economy was controlled by foreign monopoly capital. Truman's "Point Four" program enabled American imperialism to intervene in Lebanese government agencies, and Americans interfered in the internal affairs of trade unions under the pretext of "teaching the working people how to work in trade unions."

Habr said that despite various repressions and persecutions, the Lebanese working people are uniting to actively fight for improved living conditions.

Delanoue, General Secretary of the International Federation of Teachers' Unions (Industrial Department of the World Federation of Trade Unions), pointed out that in capitalist, colonial, and semi-colonial countries, millions of children do not receive even the most basic education, and teachers live in very difficult conditions. He said that only by maintaining the unity between mental and manual laborers can the struggle for peace, for the development of economic and cultural ties, and for improved living conditions be victorious. Delanoue called on the delegates to support the teachers' struggle for the right of all young people to education, for democratic education, and for peace and friendship among the peoples of all countries.

Fagbami, the trade union representative from Dahomey (Black Africa), spoke about the struggle of the working people of Black Africa. He said that the trade unions of Black Africa have adopted various forms of struggle, which resulted in the French colonial authorities passing a labor law in 1952. He said that the working people of Black Africa are intensifying their struggle and strengthening their ties with their brothers, the French working people, because only unity can make the struggle victorious.

Mitsuo Nakamura, a representative of the Japanese working people, said that most of the seventeen Japanese delegates attending the congress were sent by trade union organizations that have not yet joined the World Federation of Trade Unions. He spoke about the various struggles of Japanese workers to increase wages, oppose the Korean War, oppose American occupation, and strive for national freedom and independence. He said that in the past year, many large-scale strikes have taken place in Japan. In August of this year, the strike of more than 150,000 workers working in military camps and arsenals was the first in Japanese history. The Japanese working class is also at the forefront of the nationwide struggle against requisitioning farmers' land to build American military airports, shooting ranges, barracks, and ammunition depots. The nationwide movement to develop trade and cultural relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China has recently been particularly widespread. He said that Japanese workers are following the line of the World Federation of Trade Unions, expanding and strengthening the unity of the working class.

Manuel Rivas, a non-voting delegate and former General Secretary of the Spanish National Confederation of Labor, expressed the hope that the congress would pass some resolutions to strengthen the struggle against Spanish fascism and international fascism.

Rossi, Assistant Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, assured the congress on behalf of the Catholic worker members of the General Confederation of Labor that Catholics will continue to fight alongside all Italian working people to improve living conditions. Rossi said that Catholic trade unions engaged in divisive activities are sparing no effort to create hatred among working people of different religious beliefs, while the Italian General Confederation of Labor unites working people with various views in order to carry out effective struggles and crush the capitalists' attacks on the people's vital rights. He called on the delegates to intensify the struggle to win the unity of working people with different worldviews and different religious beliefs.

Representatives of the Veracruz dockworkers' independent union and the International Organization of Journalists also spoke at the meeting.

Finally, Saillant made concluding remarks. He summarized the discussion of his report, saying that the delegates' speeches proved the growth and maturity of the international trade union movement. He said that the World Federation of Trade Unions supports the proposal to set a day for international struggle in solidarity with the Vietnamese people and to strive for an end to the world's colonial wars. Saillant asked the West German trade union representatives to tell the German workers and the entire German people that the World Federation of Trade Unions firmly opposes the Bonn and Paris military treaties. He said that the struggle of the German working people is not isolated, and he also asked the British trade unions to participate in the struggle against the revival of German fascism and against turning West Germany into a base for aggression.

Saillant said that this congress should send an open letter to trade unions that have not joined the World Federation of Trade Unions, asking them to take concerted action. The conference will continue to discuss this important issue and methods for achieving concerted action.

The majority of Saillant's concluding remarks concerned the struggle for concerted action in capitalist, colonial, and semi-colonial countries. He sharply criticized the splitting activities of the reactionary

    世界工会第三次代表大会继续举行会议
    赛扬就第一项议程作总结发言
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社维也纳十五日讯：世界工会第三次代表大会十四日上午会议继续讨论赛扬的报告。会议由印度代表丹吉担任主席。
    黎巴嫩代表埃利亚斯·哈布尔在发言中谈到黎巴嫩工人的艰苦生活。他指出主要原因是黎巴嫩经济受到外国垄断资本的控制。杜鲁门“第四点”计划，使美帝国主义能够插足于黎巴嫩的政府机构，美国人藉口“教劳动人民学会工会工作方法”对工会的内部事务进行干涉。
    哈布尔说，尽管受到各种镇压和迫害，黎巴嫩劳动人民正团结起来积极进行争取改善生活状况的斗争。
    教育工会国际（世界工联产业部）总书记德拉努指出，在资本主义、殖民地和半殖民地国家，千百万儿童得不到最起码的教育，教员过着很苦的生活。他说，只有保持脑力与体力劳动者之间的团结，争取和平、争取发展经济文化联系和改善生活条件的斗争才会取得胜利。德拉努要求代表们支持教员争取所有青年人受教育的权利、争取民主教育、争取各国人民之间的和平与友谊的斗争。
    达荷美（黑非洲）的工会代表法格巴米布谈到黑非洲劳动人民的斗争情况，他说，黑非洲各工会采取了各种形式进行斗争，结果迫使法国殖民当局在一九五二年通过了劳工法。他说，黑非洲的劳动人民正加紧进行斗争，加强与他们的兄弟——法国劳动人民的联系，因为只有团结，才能使斗争得到胜利。
    日本劳动人民的代表中村满夫说，出席大会的十七位日本代表，大多数是还没有参加世界工联的工会组织派来的。他谈到了日本工人为争取增加工资、反对朝鲜战争、反对美国占领、争取国家自由与独立而进行的各种斗争。他说，过去一年，日本发生了许多大规模罢工。今年八月，在军营和兵工厂工作的十五万以上工人的罢工，在日本历史上还是第一次。在反对征用农民土地修建美军机场、靶场、兵营和弹药库的全国性的斗争中，日本工人阶级也是站在最前面的。争取发展与苏联和中华人民共和国的贸易和文化关系的全国性运动，近来有了特别广泛的开展。他说，日本工人正遵循世界工联的路线，扩大并加强工人阶级队伍的团结。
    列席代表、前西班牙全国劳工联合会总书记曼努埃尔·里瓦斯表示希望大会通过一些决定，加强反对西班牙法西斯主义与国际法西斯主义的斗争。
    意大利总工会助理书记罗西代表总工会天主教工人会员向大会保证：天主教徒将和意大利全体劳动人民一同继续为改善生活条件而斗争。罗西说，从事分裂活动的天主教工会正不遗余力制造不同宗教信仰的劳动人民之间的仇恨，而意大利总工会则团结了抱各种见解的劳动人民，以便进行有效的斗争，粉碎资本家对人民切身权利的进攻。他要求与会代表加紧斗争，争取抱不同世界观与不同宗教信仰的劳动人民之间的团结。
    在会上发言的还有委拉克路斯码头工人独立工会代表和国际新闻工作者协会代表。
    最后，赛扬作了总结发言。他总结关于他的报告的讨论说，代表们的发言证明了国际工会运动的壮大和成熟。他说，世界工联支持关于定出一个声援越南人民和争取结束世界殖民战争国际斗争日的建议。赛扬要求西德工会代表告诉德国工人和全体德国人民，世界工联坚决反对波恩和巴黎军事条约。他说，德国劳动人民的斗争不是孤立的，他还要求英国工会参加反对德国法西斯主义复活，反对变西德为侵略基地的斗争。
    赛扬说，这次大会应向没有参加世界工联的工会发出一封公开信，要求他们采取一致行动。大会将继续讨论这一重要问题以及取得一致行动的方法。
    赛扬总结发言的大部分讲到在资本主义、殖民地和半殖民地国家争取一致行动的斗争。他尖锐地批评“国际自由工会联合会”、美国劳工联合会和产业工会联合会反动领袖的分裂活动。
    下一次会议将在十五日举行，首先将由维多里奥就第二项议程作报告。
