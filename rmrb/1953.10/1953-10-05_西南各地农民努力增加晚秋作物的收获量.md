    Farmers in various parts of Southwest China are striving to increase the harvest of late autumn crops. Sichuan Province has reported bumper harvests of various major crops, but Fengdu, Fuling, Changshou, Tongliang, and other counties have been affected by autumn drought, which has impacted the normal growth of sweet potatoes and other late autumn miscellaneous grain crops. Farmers in drought-stricken areas have immediately been抢水贮水 (rushed to seize water and store water) and using manual labor to irrigate crops. The sweet potatoes in the plains have been rescued and are mostly growing well. In Changshou County, some sweet potatoes in the drought-affected mountainous areas were missing plants. The replanting of turnips and vegetables by farmers has been largely completed. In Tongliang County, under the slogan of "Save one seedling and get one, save one piece of land and get one," farmers are vigorously rescuing sweet potatoes, peanuts, and other late autumn crops. In the eighth district of the county, more than one hundred district cadres and school teachers are helping the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, as well as farmers lacking labor, to fight the drought and protect the seedlings, so that sweet potatoes and other crops can grow normally. In parts of Yunnan, Xikang, and Guizhou provinces where late rice has not yet been harvested, farmers are actively preventing floods and waterlogging to ensure a good harvest. After correcting the slack and 麻痹 (numbing) thoughts of some farmers who believed that "good seedlings mean good harvests," Qujing, Yiliang, Hexi, and other counties in Yunnan Province put forward the slogan of "Do not easily lose a single grain of food" and actively repaired dikes and weirs to prevent floods and protect the autumn harvest. After thorough inspection, the fourth district of Hexi County used 2,445 laborers to renovate all 41 small rivers in the district and newly built and renovated 50 river dams, thereby strengthening flood prevention in mountainous areas and ensuring a good autumn grain harvest. Farmers in Suiyang County, Guizhou Province, have been fighting various disasters from spring plowing to autumn harvest. Now, the autumn rice is growing well. According to typical surveys, it is estimated that production can increase by 8% compared to last year.

    西南各地农民努力增加晚秋作物的收获量
    西南各地农民正为增加晚秋作物的收获量而努力。四川省各种主要作物都告丰收，但酆都、涪陵、长寿、铜梁等县因秋旱影响红苕（甘藷）和其他晚秋杂粮作物的正常生长。受秋旱地区的农民都立即抢水贮水和用人力浇灌作物，平坝地区的红苕已抢救过来，大部生长良好。长寿县部分受旱的山区红苕缺窝，农民补种萝卜、蔬菜已大体完成。铜梁县农民在“救一窝得一窝，救一块得一块”的保苗口号下，大力抢救红苕、花生等晚秋作物。该县第八区即有区干部、学校教员一百余人，帮助革命烈士和革命军人的家属及缺乏劳动力的农民抗旱保苗，使红苕等作物得到正常生长。云南、西康、贵州等省晚稻尚未收完的部分地区，农民正积极防洪、防涝，以保证丰收。云南省曲靖、宜良、河西等县纠正部分农民“苗好收成好”的松劲麻痹思想后，提出“不轻易损失一颗粮食”的口号，积极修补堤、堰，防洪保秋。河西县第四区经过深入检查，用二千四百四十五个人工，重新整修全区四十一条小河，并新修和整修拦河坝五十座，从而加强了山区防洪，保证秋粮丰收。贵州省绥阳县农民从春耕到秋收一直和各种灾害作斗争，现在秋禾生长良好，据典型调查，估计可比去年增产百分之八。
