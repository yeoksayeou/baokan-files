Štejnar, Director of the Czechoslovak State Film Bureau O. Machaček, heads of various government ministries, representatives of people's organizations, and many cultural workers.

Ye Yiqun, head of the Chinese film delegation, and all members of the delegation were also invited to attend.
    Machaček delivered a speech at the meeting, pointing out that new Chinese films screened in Czechoslovakia in the past were widely welcomed by the Czechoslovak people. They provided much inspiration to Czechoslovak filmmakers in creating new types of characters. He said that the new Chinese films screened during this film week will allow the Czechoslovak people to see the new life of the Chinese people, thereby enriching their own cultural life and further enhancing the friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak people.
    Ye Yiqun then delivered a speech, introducing the recent situation of the new Chinese film industry and the growing cultural exchanges between the two countries since the signing of the Sino-Czechoslovak Cultural Cooperation Agreement. He said that Chinese filmmakers participating in this film week will have the opportunity to learn valuable experience from Czechoslovak filmmakers.
    After the opening ceremony, the Chinese film "South and North" with Czech subtitles was screened and was warmly welcomed by the audience.
