State-owned coal mines in North China overfulfilled the national production task for the entire month of September three days ahead of schedule. As of the 27th, the mines in the entire region had completed 102% of the September production plan. Among them, Datong Mine completed 125%; Yangquan Mine completed 113%; Fengfeng Mine completed 101%; Luan Mine completed 100%; and Jingxi Mine completed 101%. In addition, Kailuan Mine completed 96%; Jingxing Mine completed 94%, and it is estimated that the task can be completed one day ahead of schedule.

Now, under the leadership of the Party, coal mine workers in the entire region have launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy, striving to complete the goal of increasing raw coal production by 400,000 tons and saving 95 billion yuan.

Xinhua News Agency: Major workshops of Tangshan Steel Plant, Zhaogezhuang Coal Mine, and Qixin Cement Plant in Tangshan City have completed their September production plans ahead of schedule. The output of major workshops such as steelmaking, rolling, and casting at Tangshan Steel Plant all exceeded the national plan. The pass rate of steel ingots reached 99.77%, exceeding the quota by 0.87 points, and the pass rate of steel products reached 99.93%, exceeding the quota by 0.63 points. The consumption of pig iron was 2.65% lower than the quota. Qixin Cement Plant completed the competition plan for August and September two days ahead of schedule. The quality of cement in September increased by 51.9% compared to the previous month.

Since September, the workers of these factories and mines, combined with checking the production situation in August, have formulated team and workshop guarantee plans and launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy. After the workers in the Rolling Department of Tangshan Steel Plant launched small-scale competitions within the teams, the average hourly output of various steel products increased by 11% compared to August. Cai Liancheng, a worker in the Steelmaking Department, after research, created a set of converter operation methods, which reduced blowing loss by 36% and reduced pig iron consumption to 6.2%. The grinding workshop of Qixin Cement Plant established a patrol inspection system and launched a "three diligence" movement of "diligent touching, diligent watching, and diligent oiling," ensuring the safe operation of the machines, and the output exceeded the factory's historical record. After Zhaogezhuang Coal Mine implemented the circulating operation chart, the daily output of coal in mid-September increased by 5.48% compared with the beginning of the month, and the coal truck operation rate increased by 25%. In addition, these factories and mines also paid attention to promoting various advanced experiences in the competition.

    唐山市唐山钢厂主要车间、赵各庄煤矿和启新水泥厂，提前完成了九月份的生产计划。唐山钢厂炼钢、轧钢、铸造等主要车间的产量都超额完成国家计划，钢锭的合格率达到百分之九十九点七七，超过定额零点八七，钢材合格率达到百分之九十九点九三，超过定额零点六三，生铁消耗低于定额百分之二点六五。启新水泥厂提前两天完成了八、九两月的竞赛计划。九月份水泥质量比上月提高百分之五十一点九。
    九月以来，这些厂矿职工结合检查八月份生产情况，订出了小组、车间保证计划，并展开了增产节约竞赛。唐山钢厂轧钢部职工开展组内小型竞赛以后，各种钢材每小时的产量平均比八月份提高了百分之十一。炼钢部工人蔡连成经过钻研，创造出一套转炉操作法，使吹损降低百分之三十六，生铁消耗降到百分之六点二。启新水泥厂磨灰车间建立了巡回检查制，并开展勤摸、勤看、勤浇油等三勤运动，保证了机器安全运转，产量超过该厂历史上的最高纪录。赵各庄煤矿实行循环作业指示图表后，九月中旬煤的日产量比月初提高百分之五点四八，煤车运转率提高了百分之二十五。比外，这些厂矿在竞赛中还注意了推广各种先进经验。
