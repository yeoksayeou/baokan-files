Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 24th - The Polish member of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, General Unglowsky, sent a letter to the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, Hull, on the 15th, declaring the reservation of the right to re-raise the issues he raised in his letters of protest to Clark on September 10th and 21st. General Unglowsky sent a letter to the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, Clark, on September 10th, strongly protesting the violation by the United States armed forces of the rights guaranteed to the neutral nation inspection teams of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission by the Armistice Agreement, the abduction of the Polish interpreter of the Kangnung neutral nation inspection team on September 9th, and demanding the return of the abducted Polish interpreter. On September 21st, General Unglowsky once again lodged a strong protest to Clark on this issue, and protested against the U.S. side's threats, obstruction, and attempted bribery of other Polish personnel of the neutral nation inspection teams. However, Clark ignored these two protests. The U.S. Chief Commissioner of the Military Armistice Commission, Brigadier General Bryan, had twice written letters distorting the facts in an attempt to shirk the responsibility that the U.S. side should bear. The full text of General Unglowsky's letter of the 15th is as follows: Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, General John Hull, U.S. Army.
    Regarding Brigadier General Bryan's reply of September 28th to my letter of September 21st to General Clark, I declare: Because the reply provides an entirely unfounded answer to the questions I raised, I will not recognize it and reserve the right to re-raise the issues I raised in my letters of September 10th and 21st, 1953.
    Member of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission
    Major General Unglowsky

    中立国监察委员会波兰委员致函联合国军总司令赫尔
    声明保留对美方重提抗议的权利
    【新华社开城二十四日电】中立国监察委员会波兰委员翁格洛夫斯基将军十五日致函联合国军总司令赫尔，声明保留权利重提他在九月十日和二十一日致克拉克的抗议信中提出的问题。翁格洛夫斯基将军曾于九月十日致函联合国军总司令克拉克，严重抗议美国武装部队侵犯停战协定所保证给予中立国监察委员会中立国视察小组的权利，在九月九日劫持江陵中立国视察小组的波兰译员，并要求将被劫持的波兰译员送回。九月二十一日，翁格洛夫斯基将军就这一问题再度向克拉克提出严重抗议，并抗议美方威胁、阻挠和企图贿买其他中立国视察小组波兰人员的事件。但是克拉克对这两次抗议不加理会。军事停战委员会美方首席委员勃里安曾在两次来信中歪曲事实，企图推卸美方对此应负的责任。翁格洛夫斯基将军十五日信件的全文如下：联合国军总司令美国陆军上将约翰·赫尔
    关于勃里安少将九月二十八日对我在九月二十一日致克拉克上将函的复信，我声明：由于该复信对我提出的责问所作答复全无根据，我将不承认它，并保留权利重提我一九五三年九月十日与二十一日信中所曾提出过的问题。
