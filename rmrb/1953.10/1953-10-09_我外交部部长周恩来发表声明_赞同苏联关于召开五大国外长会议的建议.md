    My Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai Issues Statement
    Endorsing Soviet Proposal for Five-Power Foreign Ministers Meeting

    [Xinhua News Agency, October 8th] Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, issued a statement on the 8th endorsing the Soviet government's note to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States regarding the proposal to convene a meeting of the five foreign ministers. The full text is as follows:

    Statement by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Regarding Endorsement of the Soviet Government's Note to the Governments of France, Britain, and the United States Regarding the Proposal to Convene a Meeting of the Five Foreign Ministers

    On September 28, 1953, the Soviet government sent a note to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States, proposing to convene a meeting of foreign ministers to begin work on the following: 1. Reviewing measures to ease international tensions at a meeting attended by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of France, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China; 2. Discussing the German question at a meeting attended by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, including all proposals made during the preparatory period of the meeting. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China hereby authorizes me to express its complete endorsement of this proposal by the Soviet government.

    The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the realization of the Korean armistice has created favorable conditions for easing international tensions and has proven that all international disputes can be resolved through peaceful consultation. The urgent task at present is to resolutely ensure the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, strictly prevent the recurrence of aggressive war, stop all conspiracies to obstruct and undermine the political conference, and promote the prompt convening of the political conference with the participation of neutral nations to discuss issues such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the peaceful resolution of the Korean question.

    The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the United Nations should be an organization to safeguard world peace and international security, and should not be an instrument for the United States to carry out aggression. Because the Chinese people have chosen a people's democratic system that suits the needs of the Chinese people but does not suit the taste of the authorities in Washington, the United States government is obstructing the People's Republic of China from obtaining its rightful place in the United Nations. However, many major international issues, especially Asian issues, cannot be resolved without the participation of the People's Republic of China. Therefore, if the United Nations is to truly and effectively fulfill its responsibility of safeguarding world peace and international security, it must first restore the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

    The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has always adhered to the peaceful policy of resolving all international disputes through consultation and peaceful coexistence with countries with different systems, and has always strived to comprehensively ease international tensions in order to consolidate peace in the Far East and the world. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China fully supports the Soviet government's proposal to convene a meeting of the five foreign ministers, because after the Second World War, the five major powers of France, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China bear a particularly important responsibility for resolving major issues of peace and international security. Therefore, convening a meeting of the foreign ministers of these five major powers to review measures to ease international tensions is in line with the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world.

    我外交部部长周恩来发表声明
    赞同苏联关于召开五大国外长会议的建议
    【新华社八日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来在八日发表关于赞同苏联政府照会法英美三国政府关于召开五大国外长会议的建议的声明。全文如下：
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来关于赞同苏联政府照会法英美三国政府关于召开五大国外长会议的建议的声明
    一九五三年九月二十八日，苏联政府照会法、英、美三国政府，建议召开外长会议，从下列工作着手：一、在由法国、英国、美国、苏联和中华人民共和国的外交部部长参加的会议上审查缓和国际紧张局势的措施；二、在由法国、英国、美国和苏联外交部部长参加的会议上讨论德国问题，包括在会议筹备期间所提出的一切建议。中华人民共和国中央人民政府兹特授权本人对苏联政府这一建议，表示完全赞同。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为，朝鲜停战的实现，已为缓和国际紧张局势创造了有利的条件，并已证明一切国际争端是可以用和平协商的方法求得解决的。当前的迫切的任务是坚决保证朝鲜停战协定的实施，严防侵略战争的再起，制止一切阻挠和破坏政治会议的阴谋，促成政治会议能够在有中立国参加的条件下的迅速召开，以便协商撤退一切外国军队与和平解决朝鲜问题等问题。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为，联合国应当成为保障世界和平及国际安全的组织，而不应当成为美国进行侵略的工具。美国政府因为中国人民选择了合乎中国人民的需要而不合乎华盛顿当局口味的人民民主制度，竟阻挠中华人民共和国得到它在联合国中应有的地位。但是许多重大国际问题，首先是亚洲问题，如果没有中华人民共和国参加，是不能解决的。因此，联合国要真正有效地履行保障世界和平及国际安全的职责，就必须首先恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利。
   中华人民共和国中央人民政府一贯坚持协商解决一切国际纠纷及与不同制度国家和平共处的和平政策，始终为争取全面缓和国际紧张局势以巩固远东和世界和平而努力。中华人民共和国中央人民政府完全赞成苏联政府关于召开五大国外长会议的建议，因为在第二次世界大战之后，法、英、美、苏联和中华人民共和国五大国，对于解决和平与国际安全的重大问题，负有特别重要的责任。因此，召开这五大国的外长会议来审查缓和国际紧张局势的措施，是符合全世界爱好和平人民的愿望的。　　　　　　　　一九五三年十月八日于北京
