The progress of basic construction projects in various parts of the country has accelerated. Through the efforts of construction in the third quarter and the current increase production and practice economy movement, the progress of basic construction projects in many regions of the country has been greatly accelerated, and it is estimated that this year's construction tasks of many major projects can be completed on schedule within the year.

Looking at the situation in several important regions: In East China, most of the projects of the East China Construction Engineering Company of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry of the Central People's Government started late this year due to insufficient preparation. In July and August, only about 77% of the monthly progress plan was completed. By September, the company concentrated all its efforts on implementing construction operation plans and promoting advanced experience on various construction sites, ensuring the progress and quality of the project, and exceeding the project plan by 12% for the entire month. For example, among the 43 construction sites that have started in Shanghai and Nanjing, 39 construction sites have overfulfilled the progress plan. In the Central and South China region, the workload completed in the main industrial systems of iron and steel, coal, electricity, non-ferrous metals, and machinery in June, July, and August also exceeded the workload completed in the previous five months. According to this increasingly improving speed, the major projects in the Central and South China region, which account for more than three-quarters of the total basic construction workload this year, can be guaranteed to be completed on schedule within the year. By the end of September, the key construction sites of various construction engineering companies in Shenyang had completed 78% of the annual project progress plan, and 43% of the projects had been completed ahead of schedule, and the quality had reached more than 90% of the specified standards. The progress of basic construction in Harbin in September was twice as fast as in August. It is estimated that Shanxi Province will complete 95% of this year's basic construction tasks, and the key projects of great significance to national construction can be guaranteed to be completed. The workload completed in September by the various construction sites of the Engineering Company of the Xi'an Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau exceeded one and a half times that of August, equivalent to 70% of the workload completed in the past eight months.

Since entering the third quarter, the Party committees at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party and the leading organs of relevant financial and economic departments have further strengthened their leadership over basic construction. In the Central and South China region, since the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a basic construction work conference in late July, the Party committees of all provinces and cities have specifically organized forces to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the basic construction projects in their regions, and have ranked them according to the importance and urgency of the projects, and have planned to postpone and reduce some secondary projects, so as to concentrate efforts to complete major projects. For example, after the project ranking in Henan Province, 88% of the major projects accounting for the total basic construction workload of the province can be completed within the year. In other regions such as Wuhan and Jiangxi and Hunan provinces, where the basic construction tasks are relatively large, after the project ranking, it can also be guaranteed to complete 73% to 80% of the major projects accounting for the total workload within the year. The Central and South China Financial and Economic Committee has also organized the site directors of major projects in the entire region twice to concentrate on learning the business knowledge and experience of planning management, which has played a significant role in changing the chaotic management phenomena of many construction sites in the past and accelerating the progress of the project. After September, the Urban Work Department of the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and other relevant departments also dispatched seven working groups to key construction sites such as the Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, the Guangdong Zini Sugar Factory, and the Hunan Xiashesi Power Plant to inspect and assist in their work. Local people's governments have also actively organized the forces of various departments to support basic construction. The various construction units under the Shanxi Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau launched a quality inspection campaign in August, tightened the management organizations at the company and work area levels, concentrated more than 50% of the technical and management personnel on the construction sites, and established a division of labor and responsibility system for technical personnel. Therefore, the quality of the project has been generally improved, especially the quality of the reinforced concrete project, which is the largest and most important, is the best, and no quality rework accidents have occurred in August and September. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government has also specifically organized the supply of hardware and equipment. Many basic construction units have further improved construction management in the third quarter. The Tianjin Municipal People's Government issued instructions on strengthening transportation work on September 23 to ensure the timely supply of basic construction materials. The city's transportation company has transferred more than 2,000 large trucks to transport a large number of basic construction materials to various construction sites in a timely manner. In the past, the construction sites of the Engineering Company of the Xi'an Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau separated bricklayers and ordinary workers into separate groups, and the coordination was not close. Bricklayers often felt that the supply of materials was not timely, while ordinary workers often "idled". Now, bricklayers and ordinary workers are mixed into groups, and the division of labor is clear, eliminating the chaos in construction. The efficiency of construction sites implementing planned management in Wuhan is generally 20% to 30% higher than in the past.

At present, the employees of many basic construction sites are enthusiastically carrying out the increase production and practice economy competition, and are striving to complete the annual construction tasks in the fourth quarter. The various construction engineering companies in Shenyang have transferred more than two-thirds of their cadres to the construction sites to strengthen specific leadership on the site, and strive to comprehensively complete the national plan before the freeze. From October, the employees of the construction sites under the East China Construction Engineering Company of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry of the Central People's Government responded to the call to increase production and practice economy with practical actions such as learning to use advanced tools, advanced operating methods, and saving materials. Advanced tools such as ash spreaders and plastering machines have been widely used on various construction sites, further improving work efficiency. After the Qiu Genxiang mud worker team of the 801 construction site used the ash spreader, they achieved a new record of laying 14,355 unified bricks per day for clear water wall bricklaying. After the mud workers of the 203 construction site used the plastering machine, the efficiency of plastering walls was three times higher than in the past. In order to overcome the slackening mentality of some construction sites due to the imminent completion of the project, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the CPC specially convened a cadre meeting of basic construction units and relevant departments of the city on October 13, calling on them to make persistent efforts and strive to comprehensively complete this year's tasks.

    全国各地基本建设工程的进度加快了
    许多主要工程任务可在年内完成
    经过第三季度的努力施工和目前的增产节约运动，全国许多地区基本建设工程的进展速度已大大加快，许多主要工程今年的建设任务估计可以在年内按期完成。
    从几个重要地区的情况来看：在华东地区，中央人民政府第一机械工业部华东建筑工程公司的大部分工程，今年因准备不够，开工较迟，七、八月份都只完成月进度计划百分之七十七左右，到九月份，该公司集中全力在各工地贯彻施工作业计划和推广先进经验，保证了工程进度和质量，全月超额百分之十二完成了工程计划。如上海、南京已开工的四十三个工地中，就有三十九个工地超额完成了进度计划。中南区钢铁、煤、电、有色金属、机械等主要工业系统的基本建设工程，六、七、八三个月内完成的工作量，也超过了以前五个月完成的工作量。按照这个日益提高的速度进行，今年中南区占全部基本建设工作量四分之三以上的主要工程，可以保证在年内按期完成。沈阳市各建筑工程公司的重点工地，九月底已完成全年工程进度计划百分之七十八，有百分之四十三的工程已提前竣工，质量也达到了规定标准百分之九十以上。哈尔滨市基本建设的工程进度，九月份比八月份加快一倍。山西省今年的基本建设任务估计可完成百分之九十五，其中对国家建设具有重要意义的重点工程，可保证全部完成。西安市建筑工程局工程公司所属各工地九月份完成的工作量，超过八月份一倍半，相当于过去八个月内完成的工作量的百分之七十。
    进入第三季度以来，中国共产党各级党委和有关财经部门领导机关都进一步加强了对基本建设的领导。中南区自七月下旬中共中央中南局召开基本建设工作会议以后，各省、市党委都曾专门组织力量，对本地区内的基本建设工程作了全面检查，并按工程的轻重缓急加以排队，有计划地推迟和削减了一些次要工程，因而得以集中力量完成主要工程项目。如河南省经过工程排队以后，占全省基本建设工作量百分之八十八的主要工程都可在年内完成。其他如武汉市和江西、湖南等省基本建设任务较大的地区，经工程排队以后，也都可以保证在年内完成占工作总量百分之七十三到百分之八十的主要工程。中南财政经济委员会也曾先后两次组织全区各主要工程的工地主任，集中学习计划管理的业务知识和经验，这对于改变过去许多工地管理的混乱现象、加速工程进度起了很大作用。九月份以后，中共中央中南局城市工作部和其他有关部门还分别派出了七个工作组，到国营郑州第一棉纺织厂、广东紫坭糖厂、湖南下摄司电厂等重点工地检查和协助工作。各地人民政府也积极组织各部门力量来支援基本建设。山西省建筑工程局所属各施工单位，八月份开始展开了质量检查运动，紧缩了各个公司和工区一级的管理机构，把百分之五十以上的技术人员和管理人员集中到工地，并建立了技术人员的分工专责制度，因此工程质量普遍提高，特别是数量最大最重要的钢筋混凝土工程，质量最好，八、九月份没有发生过质量返工事故。北京市人民政府财政经济委员会也专门组织了五金器材的供应。许多基本建设单位在第三季度中都进一步改善了施工管理。天津市人民政府为保证基本建设材料及时供应。在九月二十三日发出了关于加强运输工作的指示。该市运输公司已增调出两千多辆大车，把大批基本建设材料及时运到了各个工地。西安市建筑工程局工程公司所属工地，过去由于瓦工和普通工分开编组，配合不紧密，瓦工常感材料供应不上，普通工却经常“窝工”。现在，瓦工和普通工混合编组，分工明确，消灭了施工中的混乱现象。武汉市实行计划管理的工地，效率一般都比过去提高百分之二十到三十。
    目前，许多基本建设工地职工正热烈展开增产节约竞赛，为在第四季度内争取完成全年建设任务而努力。沈阳市各建筑工程公司已抽调了三分之二以上的干部深入工地，加强对现场的具体领导，争取在封冻之前全面完成国家计划。中央人民政府第一机械工业部华东建筑工程公司所属工地的职工，从十月份起，以学会使用先进工具、先进操作法、节省材料等实际行动来响应增产节约号召。先进工具铺灰器、抹灰器等已普遍在各工地推广使用，进一步提高了工作效率。八零一工地邱根祥泥工三人小组使用铺灰器后，清水墙砌砖达到一天砌一万四千三百五十五块统一砖的新纪录。二零三工地泥工使用抹灰器后，粉墙的效率比过去提高了三倍。中共哈尔滨市委员会为了克服有些工地因工程结束在即而产生的松劲思想，特于十月十三日召开全市基本建设单位及有关部门干部大会，号召再接再厉，争取全面完成今年任务。（新华社）
