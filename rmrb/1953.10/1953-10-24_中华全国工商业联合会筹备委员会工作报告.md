    Work Report of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce
    Sha Qianli
    Since its establishment, the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, under the concern and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and through the efforts of the preparatory members and the hard work of the staff, has finally successfully completed the preparatory work. Now, I would like to report to the conference on several major tasks as follows:
    First, promoting the establishment and rectification of industry and commerce federations at all levels: Promoting the establishment and rectification of industry and commerce federations at all levels is one of the main tasks of the Preparatory Committee. Over the past year or so, this work has made some achievements. Up to now, there are 28 provincial-level organizations, 14 organizations directly under the central government, and 1,913 organizations in cities under the jurisdiction of provinces, cities under the jurisdiction of special districts, and counties. At the same time, the reorganization of industry and commerce federations in cities directly under the central government, most cities under the jurisdiction of provinces, and some counties has been carried out. Most major cities have established district industry and commerce federations or branches, which have played a considerable role in reflecting the opinions of small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen, promoting learning, and participating in various patriotic movements. In order to eliminate the feudal guild nature of trade association organizations and enable them to play their due role, the reorganization of trade associations in various places is also progressing steadily. State-owned enterprises and cooperatives have generally joined the industry and commerce federations and assumed certain responsibilities, strengthening the leadership and connection with private industry and commerce.
    Over the past year, the smooth development of organizational work has been based on the "Organizational Regulations of the Federation of Industry and Commerce" promulgated by the Government Administration Council. Experience has proved that wherever local industry and commerce federations correctly implement the spirit of the "Organizational Regulations," they have achieved significant achievements in establishing organizations and improving institutions. However, the rectification and reorganization work of industry and commerce federations at all levels cannot be fully completed in the short period of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce's preparatory work. Greater efforts will be needed after the official establishment of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce to continue.
    Second, promoting self-education and self-transformation among industrialists and businessmen: The earnest and effective self-education and self-transformation of industrialists and businessmen are closely related to national construction and the future of every industrialist, businessman and their enterprises. Since its establishment, the Preparatory Committee has attached great importance to this work. First, we promoted the study of the documents and resolutions of the preparatory representative meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce throughout the country. According to the requirements and arrangements of the federation, various local industry and commerce federations, preparatory members, and preparatory representatives adopted various methods to convey the resolutions and spirit of the meeting, enabling the majority of industrialists and businessmen to further understand the great significance of the "Five-Anti" movement, clarify the role of private industry and commerce, and understand the state's policies towards private industry and commerce, thereby clarifying the confusion of thought in the industrial and commercial circles after the "Five-Anti" movement. After the end of the transmission and study, we responded to the call of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and promoted the study of the Common Program among the industrial and commercial circles in various places, and successively arranged the study of various policies and current events in the process of study. Industrialists and businessmen in cities all over the country, and even in many counties and market towns, have carried out studies. The enthusiasm for learning is generally very high, and some regions have gradually established a regular learning system. From the extensiveness of the region and the number of people studying, as well as the persistence of time, it has never happened in the industrial and commercial circles. The effect of learning is also obvious. Many industrialists and businessmen have realized in the study the position and role of the Chinese national bourgeoisie in the new democratic society, and have increased their confidence in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and economic construction. This kind of learning has played a considerable role in correctly giving play to the enthusiasm of private industrialists and businessmen.
    Third, guiding private industrialists and businessmen to improve production management and rectify business style: Our work in this area is primarily to exchange advanced experience in improving production and operation. With the strong help of various departments of the state-owned economy, and according to the requirements of local industry and commerce federations and manufacturers, we had introduced 124 pieces of advanced experience of state-owned industry by the end of September this year, of which 70 percent were in technology and 30 percent in management, partially meeting the needs of the industrial and commercial circles. At the same time, we collected and introduced various experiences of private industrialists and businessmen in various places related to improving production and operation, including those related to industrial production, such as increasing production and practicing economy, carrying out business competitions, production competitions, and improving product quality; those related to commercial circulation, such as the experience of material exchange meetings of various types in markets at all levels; those related to improving production and sales, such as convening professional meetings and handicraft meetings. The introduction of these experiences has played a role in exchange and promotion. Secondly, in order to help private industrialists and businessmen strengthen financial management and improve the accounting system, the Standing Committee decided to establish an accounting committee, hiring specialists to conduct a general survey of the current accounting situation of private industrialists and businessmen; initially, nine different types and accounting methods of accounting systems were designed for the three major categories of industry, commerce, and service industries, and are now being sent to relevant departments of the central and local governments and local industry and commerce federations to widely solicit opinions, and will be gradually implemented in a key pilot manner after modification. Detailed information is provided in a separate written report. Again, improving labor-capital relations is an important link in doing a good job in production and operation. After the "Five-Anti" movement, although labor-capital relations in industry and commerce have been partially improved, they were often not normal for a period of time, thus hindering the development of production and operation. Based on this situation, we called on the industrial and commercial circles to launch a new study of labor-capital relations, and required industry and commerce federations at all levels to continue to strengthen education for industrialists and businessmen, actively cooperate with the trade union's movement to consolidate labor discipline, and conscientiously accept the supervision of the worker masses, listing the work of improving labor-capital relations as one of the important tasks in 1953. In addition to providing learning materials, we have successively introduced experiences in doing a good job in labor-capital relations, master-apprentice relations, holding good labor-capital consultation meetings, and signing good labor-capital contracts and master-apprentice contracts. At present, under the leadership of the People's Government and inspired by the selfless spirit of the working class, industry and commerce in many large and medium-sized cities have successively signed labor-capital contracts, and some have conducted inspections and revisions after the contracts have expired; industry and commerce in many cities have either implemented democratic reforms and production reforms, or launched campaigns to increase production and practice economy, generally improving labor-capital relations and improving production and operation.
    With the increasing prosperity of the market, some industrialists and businessmen have again engaged in illegal acts in violation of the Common Program, such as speculative purchases, tax evasion, shoddy manufacturing, and cutting corners, and even refusing the leadership of the state-owned economy. In order to correct business practices and prevent a recurrence of the "five poisons," in addition to continuously exposing and strictly criticizing the illegal acts that have been discovered in various places, we also required industry and commerce federations in various places to solemnly conduct an ideological education on patriotism and law-abiding to consolidate the achievements of the "Five-Anti" movement. Through the efforts of industry and commerce federations in various places, industrialists and businessmen in many regions have conscientiously conducted self-examination and supplementary reporting of income tax and business tax, achieving certain achievements.
    Fourth, reflecting opinions and making suggestions to the People's Government and relevant authorities: First, the 320 proposals of the preparatory representative meeting last year were carefully and meticulously handled according to the meeting's review opinions. In addition to those handled by this association with reference, they were promptly sent to 30 relevant central departments and 26 relevant local departments. After many contacts, these proposals have basically been explained. Secondly, we often collect materials from industry and commerce in various places on issues such as processing orders, profits, funds, taxes, and labor-capital relations, and conduct comprehensive analysis based on the reports of industry and commerce federations at all levels; at the same time, we investigate and understand the situation of industry and commerce by convening forums, briefings, or sending people to various places to collect the opinions of industrialists and businessmen, some of which are compiled into reference materials, and some are made into special reports, which are reported to the relevant government departments separately. It has played a certain role in improving public-private relations, labor-capital relations, and production and operation.
    Fifth, publishing the "Industry and Commerce Circles" monthly magazine: In order to conduct ideological education for private industrialists and businessmen, exchange production experience, and publicize policies and regulations, the "Industry and Commerce Circles" monthly magazine was launched in May this year, and has now been published to the sixth issue, with a circulation of 43,000 copies, covering all parts of the country. However, this publication still has many shortcomings in content and form. We ask the national industrial and commercial circles to improve it and support it so that it can play its due role. In addition, in order to exchange the experience of the work of industry and commerce federations in various places and closely connect the work, we published the internal publication "Work Briefing" at the beginning of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee, which has now become an important reference material for the work of the industry and commerce federations.
    Sixth, preparing for the convening of the member representative conference: In order to convene the member representative conference, we drafted the method for generating representatives and the organizational regulations of the conference, and drafted the articles of association of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and other related documents, which were discussed in detail by the Standing Committee and decisions were made. Based on the decisions, we launched preparatory work such as consultation and election of representatives. According to the method for generating representatives, there are a total of 640 representatives, including regional representatives, representatives of national state-owned enterprises, general institutions of cooperatives, general institutions of joint state-private enterprises, and specially invited representatives. The allocation of the number of regional representatives among the units in various regions is based on the specific conditions of the regions, taking into account the key points, the overall situation, industry and commerce, state-owned and private, large, medium, and small enterprises, and ethnic minorities. The number of specially invited representatives is used to invite relevant people from the central and local governments related to industry and commerce, overseas Chinese representatives, and representatives from the industrial and commercial circles in Hong Kong and Macao. The above representatives have been carefully studied by all parties and democratically consulted and elected by various regions. Therefore, this representative conference has a wider representation. As the conference date approaches, we have organized the conference working committee, and with the assistance of relevant departments, the heavy administrative work has been carried out smoothly.
    In addition, at the beginning of the establishment of this association, there was a lack of cadres and the organization was very unsound. Through continuous efforts and the help of all parties over the past year, it has gradually improved, creating favorable conditions for the development of future work. Although the income and expenditure of this association's funds have not met the requirement of accumulating 100 million yuan per month as decided by the preparatory representative meeting due to the support of all members, we have been operating in accordance with the principle of strictly practicing economy and tightening expenditures, and we are still able to maintain a balance. A detailed report on the financial income and expenditure situation will be submitted separately for review by the conference.
    Over the past year or so, the Preparatory Committee has undertaken heavy tasks with insufficient cadres and lack of experience, and has successfully completed the preparatory work. However, there are many shortcomings. First, in terms of establishing and rectifying organizations, we lack specific guidance and assistance to the work of local organizations, especially to provincial industry and commerce federations. Secondly, in terms of promoting learning and ideological education among industrialists and businessmen, there are only general calls, lacking specific guidance and inspection, especially for the growth of new illegal acts of some private industrialists and businessmen, there is insufficient vigilance, and we have failed to provide timely education and prevention. Again, due to the lack of in-depth investigation and research on the actual production and operation of private enterprises, we have not provided due assistance to private industrialists and businessmen in guiding production and improving operation, and have not even been able to promote other tasks with the guidance of production and operation as the center. Finally, it is manifested in the insufficient close contact with all parties, and the insufficient comprehensive and timely reflection and suggestions to the government. On some important issues, we still cannot consider it from the height of principle, and generally, there are more reflections and fewer suggestions.
    Although the preparatory work over the past year has many shortcomings, it has basically completed the tasks stipulated by the preparatory representative meeting last year. This is the result of the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the joint efforts of the preparatory members, preparatory representatives, and local industry and commerce federations, and the unanimous support of industrialists and businessmen across the country. Now that the preparatory period has come to an end, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is about to be officially established. With the progress of national industrialization, the responsibilities of industrialists and businessmen across the country will become increasingly heavy. We believe that the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce will be able to lead industrialists and businessmen across the country to unite and progress more closely, exert greater strength, and assume our glorious mission in the economic construction of our great motherland.

    中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会工作报告
    沙千里
    中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会自成立以来，在中国共产党和人民政府的关切、领导下，经过筹备委员的努力和工作同志的辛勤，终于胜利地完成了筹备任务。现在把几项主要工作，向大会报告如下：
    第一、推动各级工商业联合会组织的建立和整顿：推动建立和整顿各级工商业联合会的组织，是筹备委员会的主要任务之一。一年多来，这项工作已经有所成就。迄目前止，全国已有省级组织二十八个，中央直辖市组织十四个，省辖市、专区辖市和县的组织一千九百一十三个。同时，中央各直辖市、大部分省辖市及一部分县级的工商业联合会组织已经进行了改组。各大城市大部分已建立了区工商业联合会或区分会，在反映中小工商业者的意见、推动学习和参加各项爱国运动等方面，都起了相当的作用。为了清除同业公会组织的封建行会性，使之发挥其应有的作用，各地同业公会的改组工作亦在稳步进行中，国营企业及合作社一般地都已参加了工商业联合会，并负担了一定的责任，加强了对私营工商业的领导和联系。
    一年来，组织工作的顺利展开，是以政务院所颁布的“工商业联合会组织通则”为依据的。经验证明，凡各地工商业联合会正确地贯彻了“组织通则”精神的，在建立组织、健全机构方面都获得了重大的成就。但各级工商业联合会组织遍及全国，其整顿改组工作不可能在全国工商业联合会进行筹备工作的短时期中全部完成，还需要在全国工商业联合会正式成立以后，继续作更大的努力。
    第二、推动工商界进行自我教育和自我改造：工商界认真地和有效地进行自我教育和自我改造，是与国家建设和每个工商业者及其事业的前途有密切的关系的。筹备委员会自成立之日起，就十分重视这一工作。我们首先在全国范围内推动工商业者学习全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议的文件与决议。各地各级工商业联合会、各筹备委员、筹备代表根据本会的要求与布置，采取了各种不同方式，进行了关于会议决议和精神的传达，使广大工商业者进一步认识到“五反”运动的伟大意义，明确了私营工商业的作用，体会了国家对私营工商业的方针政策，从而澄清了工商界在“五反”运动后的混乱思想。在传达学习结束以后，我们响应中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会的号召，推动各地工商界学习共同纲领，并在学习过程中，先后布置了各项政策与时事的学习。全国各地城市以至很多县和集镇的工商业者都进行了学习，学习情绪一般都很热烈，有的地区并已逐渐建立了经常性的学习制度。从地区和学习人数的广泛性及时间的持久性上说，在工商界是从来没有的。从学习的效果上说，也是明显的。不少工商业者在学习中认识到中国民族资产阶级在新民主主义社会中的地位和作用，提高了对抗美援朝和经济建设的信心。这种学习对于正确地发挥私营工商业者的积极性是起了相当作用的。
    第三、指导私营工商业者改善生产管理，端正经营作风：我们在这方面的工作，首先是交流改善生产经营的先进经验。根据各地工商业联合会及厂商的要求，经过国营经济各部门的大力帮助，到今年九月底止，我们已介绍了国营工业先进经验一百二十四件，其中技术方面占百分之七十，管理方面占百分之三十，部分地满足了工商界的需要。同时，我们分别搜集并介绍了各地私营工商业有关改善生产经营的各种经验，其中有关工业生产方面的，如增产节约、开展业务竞赛、生产竞赛、改进产品品质等经验；有关商业流转方面的，如各级市场各种类型物资交流会的经验；有关改善产销方面的，如召开专业会议和手工业会议的经验。这些经验的介绍，都起了交流推广的作用。其次，为了帮助私营工商业加强财务管理，健全会计制度，经常务委员会决议设立了建帐委员会，聘请专人，对目前私营工商业会计情况作了一般性调查；初步就工业、商业、服务业三大类别，分别设计了九种不同类型和不同记帐方法的会计制度，现在正分送中央及地方有关部门和各地工商业联合会，广泛征求意见，待加以修改后，即将采用重点试验方式逐步推行。详细情况另有书面报告。再次，改善劳资关系是搞好生产经营的重要环节。“五反”以后，工商业的劳资关系，虽然部分地有了改善，但在一个时期内多不够正常，因而阻碍了生产经营的发展。我们根据这种情况，号召工商界展开新的劳资关系的学习，并要求各级工商业联合会继续加强对工商业者的教育，积极配合工会巩固劳动纪律的运动，认真地接受工人群众的监督，将改善劳资关系的工作列为一九五三年重要任务之一。我们除提供学习资料以外，陆续介绍了关于搞好劳资关系、师徒关系、开好劳资协商会议、订好劳资合同和师徒合同的经验。目前许多大中城市的工商业在人民政府领导下，在工人阶级大公无私的精神感召下，先后签订了劳资合同，有的并在合同满期以后作了检查和修订；不少城市的工商业，有的实行了民主改革、生产改革，有的开展了增产节约，一般地改善了劳资关系，改善了生产经营。
    随着市场的日趋繁荣，部分工商业者又发生了投机套购、偷税漏税、粗制滥造、偷工减料等违反共同纲领的不法行为，甚至拒绝国营经济领导。为了端正经营作风，防止重犯“五毒”，我们除将各地已发现的违法行为，陆续揭露，严格批判外，并要求各地工商业联合会严肃地进行一次爱国守法的思想教育工作，以巩固“五反”运动的成果。通过各地工商业联合会的努力，许多地区的工商业者认真地进行所得税、营业税自查补报工作，获得了一定的成就。
    第四、向人民政府及有关机关反映意见，提出建议：首先对去年筹备代表会议的三百二十件提案，根据会议审查意见，进行了慎重细致的处理。除由本会参酌办理者外，均及时地分别送致三十个中央有关部门和二十六处地方有关部门。经过多次的联系，这些提案基本上均有了交代。其次，我们经常搜集各地工商业有关加工订货、利润、资金、税收以及劳资等问题的材料，并根据各级工商业联合会的报告加以综合分析；同时，用召集座谈会、汇报会或派人到各地去等方法调查了解工商业情况，征集工商业者的意见，有的编为参考资料，有的作成专题报告，分别向政府有关部门反映。对于改善公私关系、劳资关系和生产经营起了一定作用。
    第五、出版“工商界”月刊：为了对于私营工商业者进行思想教育、交流生产经验和宣传政策法令，今年五月创刊了“工商界”月刊，现已出至第六期，发行数字已达四万三千份，普及全国各地。但这个刊物在内容和形式上还存在着许多缺点，我们要求全国工商界来改进它并支持它，使其能发挥应有的作用。此外为着交流各地工商业联合会工作的经验，密切工作联系，我们在筹备委员会成立之初，就出版了内部刊物“工作简讯”，目前已成为工商业联合会工作上重要的参考材料。
    第六、筹备会员代表大会的召开：为了召开会员代表大会，我们拟定了代表产生办法及大会组织条例，起草了中华全国工商业联合会章程及其他多种有关文件，经过常务委员会详细的讨论，并作出了决定。我们根据决定，展开了协商和推选代表等筹备工作。按照代表产生办法，全体代表共六百四十人，计分地区代表，全国性国营企业、合作社总机构、公私合营企业全国性总机构代表及特邀代表。地区代表名额在各地区单位间的分配，是斟酌各地区的具体情况，照顾重点，照顾全面，照顾工业与商业，国营与私营，大、中、小企业和少数民族的。特邀代表名额是用以邀请中央及地方上与工商界有关人士、华侨代表、和港澳工商界代表的。以上代表都是经过各方面慎重研究，又经过各地区民主协商和推选所产生的。因此，这次代表大会更具有广泛的代表性。随着会期的临近，我们组织了大会工作委员会，由于获得了各有关部门的协助，使繁重的事务工作得以顺利进行。
    此外，本会成立之初，干部缺乏，机构很不健全，经过一年来不断的努力和各方面的帮助，已逐渐有所改进，为此后工作的开展，创造了有利的条件。本会经费收支，由于全体会员的支持，虽未能符合筹备代表会议所决定的每月积存一亿元的要求，但本厉行节约紧缩开支的原则办事，尚能保持平衡。关于财务收支情况，另有详细报告，请大会审核。
    一年多来，筹备委员会在干部不足经验缺乏的情况下，负担了繁重的任务，并胜利地完成了筹备工作。但是缺点是很多的。首先，表现在建立与整顿组织方面，我们对各地组织，特别是对省级工商业联合会的工作缺乏具体的指导和帮助。其次，表现在推动工商界学习和思想教育工作方面，也只有一般号召，缺乏具体的辅导与检查，尤其是对于一部分私营工商业者新的违法行为的滋长，警惕不足，未能及时地加以教育和防止。再次，由于对私营企业的实际生产经营情况，缺乏深入的调查和研究，因而在指导生产和改善经营等方面，对私营工商业者没有给予应有的帮助，更未做到以指导生产和经营为中心来推动其他各项工作。最后，表现在对各方面联系不够密切，对政府的反映建议不够全面及时。在某些重要问题上，我们还不能提到高度的原则性来考虑，而一般又是反映多建议少。
    一年来的筹备工作虽然存在着许多缺点，但基本上是完成了去年筹备代表会议所规定的任务。这是由于中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导，各筹备委员、筹备代表以及各地工商业联合会的共同努力和全国工商业者的一致支持的结果。现在筹备时期已届结束，中华全国工商业联合会即将正式成立，随着国家工业化的进展，全国工商业者的责任将日益加重，我们相信今后全国工商业联合会必能领导全国工商业者更加团结进步，发挥更大的力量，在我们伟大祖国的经济建设中，担负起我们的光荣任务。
