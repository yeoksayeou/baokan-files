    The Chinese People Have Begun the Struggle for National Industrialization
    Zhang Wentian, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    The People's Republic of China has been established for four years. During these four years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have waged resolute struggles against enemies at home and abroad, consolidated the independence and unity of the country, completed a series of democratic reforms, and consolidated the foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship. They have also made painstaking efforts on the production front to restore the economy damaged in the long war. Starting this year, we have begun planned economic construction, the purpose of which is to gradually realize the industrialization of the country and gradually transition to socialism.
    The founding of the People's Republic of China ended the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China. As soon as the People's Republic of China was founded, the Communist Party of China concentrated its efforts on land reform and other democratic reforms to create the necessary conditions for our country to begin planned economic construction, gradually realize national industrialization, and gradually transition to socialism. The great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, which began in the winter of 1950, not only repelled the attack of U.S. imperialism against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but also repelled its direct threat to the People's Republic of China.
    In the process of democratic reform and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, great achievements have been made in the work of restoring the national economy. From 1949 to 1952, the output of major industrial and agricultural products, taking 1949 as 100, the 1952 index for pig iron was 764, steel was 846, steel products were 848, electricity was 164, raw coal was 202, crude oil was 358, metal-cutting machine tools were 650, cement was 433, cotton yarn was 201, cotton cloth was 287, paper was 331, flour was 220, sugar was 199, matches were 129, cigarettes were 151, grain was 145, and cotton was 291.
    By 1952, the output of major industrial and agricultural products had exceeded the highest annual output in Chinese history. With the restoration and development of production, material exchanges have expanded, urban and rural economies have become increasingly prosperous, and foreign trade, especially trade with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, has continued to grow significantly. People's lives have also improved accordingly.
    In the restoration of the national economy, the strength and proportion of the socialist state-owned economy have greatly developed. In 1952, state-owned industry accounted for about 60 percent of the total output value of modern industry, of which about 80 percent was in heavy industry and about 50 percent was in light industry. In the wholesale business of commercial operations, the main commodities related to the national economy and the people's livelihood have basically been controlled by the state. At the same time, the semi-socialist cooperative economy, as a reliable assistant to the state-owned economy, has greatly developed; the state-capitalist economy, in which private enterprises are linked and combined with the state-owned economy in various forms, has also developed.
    After creating the necessary conditions in politics, economy, and other aspects, our country began its first five-year construction plan this year. The basic task of our country's first five-year construction plan is: first of all, to concentrate major forces on developing heavy industry and establish the foundation for national industrialization and national defense modernization; correspondingly, to cultivate construction talents, develop transportation, light industry, agriculture, and expand commerce; to promote the cooperativization of agriculture and handicrafts and to transform private industry and commerce in a planned way, and to correctly bring into play the role of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. All of these are to ensure the steady growth of the proportion of socialist components in the national economy, and to ensure the gradual improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards on the basis of developing production. Focusing on the development of heavy industry as the focus of economic construction is the road to socialist industrialization that the Soviet people have already taken and succeeded in, and it is the only correct road to China's socialist industrialization.
    According to the annual plan for 1953, the total industrial output value in 1953 will increase by about 23 percent compared with 1952, of which state-owned industry will increase by about 32 percent. Compared with 1952, the planned growth targets for various major products are: pig iron 13.3 percent, steel ingots 22.1 percent, copper 28.6 percent, lead 34.6 percent, zinc 32 percent, metal-cutting machine tools 4.6 percent, generators 190.9 percent, electricity generation 18.3 percent, crude oil 29.1 percent, cement 29.7 percent, timber 38 percent, cotton yarn 9.4 percent, cotton cloth 10.5 percent, and paper 7.9 percent.
    Before liberation, China was originally an economically extremely backward semi-colonial and semi-feudal country, and the plunder of the Kuomintang reactionary rule and the long-term war caused serious damage to the national economy. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, although significant achievements have been made in restoring the national economy by relying on the high political enthusiasm and creative labor of the masses, the industrial base is still very weak, the technology is still very backward, and the funds needed to develop heavy industry, the cadres familiar with industrial construction, and skilled workers are very lacking when the first five-year construction plan is started. Therefore, to complete these tasks, various difficulties will inevitably be encountered. The Communist Party of China, estimating the complex conditions for realizing industrialization and socialist transformation in such a vast and backward country as China, decided to adopt the basic policy of steady advancement, and at the same time, estimating the various favorable conditions at home and abroad, especially the people's awareness and the assistance of the Soviet Union, has full confidence in overcoming any difficulties on the road ahead.
    The Soviet Union's assistance to the economic recovery and economic construction of the People's Republic of China is of paramount importance. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed in February 1950 not only powerfully guaranteed China's independence and security, but also greatly helped China's economic development. The treaty stipulates: "The two contracting parties guarantee to develop and consolidate the economic and cultural relations between China and the Soviet Union in the spirit of friendly cooperation and in accordance with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, to provide each other with all possible economic assistance, and to conduct necessary economic cooperation." The rapid recovery of our national economy is inseparable from the economic and technical assistance provided by the great Soviet government. When our country began planned economic construction, the Soviet government agreed to provide huge, comprehensive, and systematic economic and technical assistance to the 91 new enterprises that our country started to build and rebuild this year and the 50 enterprises that have been under construction and reconstruction in the past three years. Thanks to the Soviet Union's great and selfless assistance, as Comrade Mao Zedong said in his telegram to Comrade Malenkov, "The Chinese people will be able to gradually establish their own powerful heavy industry under the effort of learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and the latest technological achievements, which is of extremely great significance for China's industrialization, the gradual transition of China to socialism, and the strengthening of the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union." Comrade Mao Zedong, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, expressed heartfelt thanks to the Soviet people and the Soviet government for this great, long-term, comprehensive, and selfless assistance. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The Chinese government and the Chinese people are willing to strengthen the economic cooperation and friendly alliance between the Soviet Union and China with their unremitting efforts in order to jointly strive for the cause of world peace."
    The rich experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism is also of paramount importance to our country's economic construction. In order to meet the needs of the whole Party in entering the period of economic construction, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions in April this year on the theoretical education of cadres in 1953-1954, requiring all Party cadres to systematically study Lenin's and Stalin's theories on Soviet socialist construction, and to seriously understand the historical experience of the Soviet Union in implementing the New Economic Policy, realizing national industrialization, agricultural cooperativization, and completing socialist construction, so as to correctly utilize the Soviet Union's experience in the process of our country's economic construction based on our country's specific conditions.
    As the first year of our country's first five-year construction plan is coming to an end, the people of the whole country are displaying high enthusiasm and initiative, carrying out a patriotic movement to increase production and practice economy, and striving to complete and overfulfill the national plan. The working people of China understand that completing the annual plan for 1953 is to take a step forward towards the country's prosperity and their own happiness, it is the growth of the proportion of socialist components in the national economy, and it is also a new blow to the imperialist aggressors.

    中国人民开始了为国家工业化的斗争
    中国共产党中央政治局委员  张闻天
    中华人民共和国成立已经四年了。在这四年中间，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，向国内外敌人进行了坚决的斗争，巩固了国家的独立和统一；完成了一系列的民主改革工作，使人民民主专政获得了巩固的基础；在生产战线上作了辛勤的努力，恢复了在长期战争中受到破坏的经济。从今年起，我们开始了有计划的经济建设，其目的是逐步实现国家的工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义。
    中华人民共和国的成立，结束了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国的统治。中华人民共和国一成立，中国共产党就集中力量来进行土地改革和其他各种民主改革，以创设必要的条件，使我国有可能开始进行有计划的经济建设，逐步实现国家的工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义。从一九五○年冬季开始的伟大的抗美援朝斗争，不但打退了美帝国主义对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的进攻，也打退了它对中华人民共和国的直接威胁。
    在民主改革和抗美援朝斗争的过程中，恢复国民经济的工作获得了很大的成就。从一九四九年到一九五二年，工农业各项主要产品的产量，如以一九四九年作为一○○，一九五二年的指数生铁为七六四，钢为八四六，钢材为八四八，电为一六四，原煤为二○二，原油为三五八，金属切削机床为六五○，水泥为四三三，棉纱为二○一，棉布为二八七，纸为三三一，面粉为二二○，糖为一九九，火柴为一二九，卷烟为一五一，粮食为一四五，棉花为二九一。
    到一九五二年，工农业主要产品的产量已超过中国历史上的最高年产量。随着生产的恢复和发展，物资交流日益扩大，城乡经济日趋繁荣，对外贸易，特别是对苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易，继续有巨大的增长。人民的生活也有相应的改善。
    在国民经济的恢复中，社会主义性质的国营经济的力量和比重有了很大的发展。一九五二年，国营工业在现代性的工业总产值中约占百分之六十，其中在重工业方面占百分之八十左右，在轻工业方面占百分之五十左右。在商业经营的批发业务方面，有关国计民生的主要商品已基本上由国家掌握。同时，作为国营经济可靠助手的半社会主义性质的合作社经济有了很大的发展；私营企业中经各种形式与国营经济相联系相结合的国家资本主义性质的经济也有了发展。
    在政治、经济等各方面创立了必要的条件之后，我国从今年起开始了第一个五年建设计划。我国第一个五年建设计划的基本任务是：首先集中主要力量发展重工业，建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础；相应地培养建设人材，发展交通运输业、轻工业、农业和扩大商业；有步骤地促进农业和手工业的合作化和进行对私营工商业的改造，并正确地发挥个体农业、手工业和私营工商业的作用。所有这些，都是为了保证国民经济中社会主义成份的比重的稳步增长，为了保证在发展生产的基础上逐步提高人民物质生活和文化生活的水平。以发展重工业为经济建设的重点，这是苏联人民所已经走过和得到成功的社会主义工业化的道路，这是中国的社会主义工业化的唯一正确的道路。
    按照一九五三年的年度计划，一九五三年的工业总产值比一九五二年将增长百分之二十三左右，其中国营工业将增长百分之三十二左右。各种主要产品和一九五二年比较，计划所规定的增长指标为：生铁百分之一三·三，钢锭百分之二二·一，铜百分之二八·六，铅百分之三四·六，锌百分之三二，金属切削机床百分之四·六，发电机百分之一九○·九，发电量百分之一八·三，原油百分之二九·一，水泥百分之二九·七，木材百分之三八，棉纱百分之九·四，棉布百分之一○·五，纸百分之七·九。
    解放前的中国，本来是一个经济上极其落后的半殖民地半封建的国家，国民党反动统治的掠夺和长期的战争，更使国民经济受到严重的破坏。中华人民共和国成立以来，虽然依靠人民群众高度的政治积极性和创造性的劳动，在恢复国民经济方面获得了显著的成就，但在开始第一个五年建设计划的时候，毕竟工业基础还很薄弱，技术还很落后，发展重工业所需要的资金，熟悉工业建设的干部和熟练工人都很缺乏。因此，要完成这些任务，不可免地会遇到各种各样的困难。中国共产党估计到在中国这样广大和落后的国家中实现工业化和社会主义改造的复杂条件，决定采取稳步前进的基本方针，同时估计到我国国内外的各种有利条件，首先是人民的觉悟和苏联的援助，有充分的信心克服前进道路上的任何困难。
    对于中华人民共和国的经济恢复和经济建设，苏联的援助都具有头等重要的意义。一九五○年二月签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约不但有力地保障了中国的独立和安全，而且大大地帮助了中国经济的发展。条约规定：“缔约国双方保证以友好合作的精神，并遵照平等、互利、互相尊重国家主权与领土完整及不干涉对方内政的原则，发展和巩固中苏两国之间的经济与文化关系，彼此给予一切可能的经济援助，并进行必要的经济合作。”我国国民经济的迅速恢复，是和伟大的苏联政府所给予的经济的和技术的援助分不开的。在我国开始进行有计划的经济建设的时候，苏联政府同意在我国从今年起着手建设和改建的九十一个新的企业以及过去三年中已在建设和改建的五十个企业中给予巨大的全面的有系统的经济的和技术的援助。由于苏联的巨大的慷慨无私的援助，正如毛泽东同志在给马林科夫同志的电文中所说，“中国人民将能够在学习苏联的先进经验和最新技术成就的努力之下，逐步地建立起自己的强大的重工业，这对于中国工业化、使中国逐步地过渡到社会主义和壮大以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，都具有极其重大的作用”。毛泽东同志代表中国人民和中国政府，对于苏联人民和苏联政府这种伟大的、长期的、全面的、无私的援助，表示了衷心的感谢。毛泽东同志指出：“中国政府和中国人民愿以自己的不懈的努力来加强苏中两国的经济合作和友好同盟，以利为世界和平事业的共同奋斗。”
    苏联建设社会主义的丰富经验，对我国的经济建设同样有头等重要的意义。为了适应全党在进入经济建设时期的需要，中国共产党中央委员会今年四月发出了关于一九五三—一九五四年干部理论教育的指示，要求全党干部，都能有系统地研究列宁、斯大林关于苏联社会主义建设的学说，认真地了解苏联执行新经济政策、实现国家工业化、农业合作化和完成社会主义建设的历史经验，以便在我国经济建设过程中根据我国具体条件正确地利用苏联的经验。
    当我国第一个五年建设计划的第一年快要结束的时候，全国人民正在发挥高度的热情和积极性，开展增加生产、厉行节约的爱国运动，为完成和超额完成国家计划而努力。中国的劳动人民了解：完成一九五三年的年度计划，这就是向国家的富强和自己的幸福前进一步，这就是国民经济中社会主义成份的比重的增长，这也就是给帝国主义侵略分子一个新的打击。
