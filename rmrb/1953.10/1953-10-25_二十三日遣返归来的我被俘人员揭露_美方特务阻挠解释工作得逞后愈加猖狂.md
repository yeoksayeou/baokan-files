    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 23rd: The three Korean People's Army POWs who returned today at Panmunjom said: When the Indian Custodial Forces did not come to take us out to listen to explanations, there was no other way to achieve the desire to return home except to jump over the barbed wire.
    Also repatriated with them today were three Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs, two of whom also escaped by jumping over the barbed wire. The other one was Yue Heidan, who stayed in the explanation tent for three hours six days ago but was not repatriated.
    Korean People's Army returnee Kim Ying-soo escaped from Camp 50, one of the Korean People's Army POW camps that our side has requested to be subject to explanation. Kim Ying-soo said that since the special agents in Camp 48 prevented the POWs from listening to explanations on the 16th, the special agents in Camp 50 happily said: "We must also resolutely prevent the POWs from listening to explanations. The Indian troops dare not enter the camp. If we delay one camp for a few days, once the 90-day explanation period is over, President Syngman Rhee can take us out." Kim Ying-soo said that he was prepared to request repatriation on the 19th when he listened to the explanation, but the Indian soldiers did not enter the camp, so he had to risk running over the barbed wire to escape. He said: The special agent elements forced the POWs to take off all their tops, arm in arm, to prevent anyone from going to listen to the explanation. As long as the Indian troops go in, they can take the POWs out to listen to the explanation.
    Korean People's Army returnees all said that since the explanation work was interrupted, the special agents in the camps had tightened their violent rule. The special agent armed "Guard Team" set up posts every few meters around the barbed wire to monitor the actions of the POWs. In addition, a "Patrol Team" was specially dispatched to patrol day and night to prevent the POWs from escaping. Many people were hung up and severely beaten at night by special agent elements for expressing their willingness to listen to explanations.
    Volunteer Army returnees Wang Xiang and Wang Xianzhang both escaped from the "hospital" of the POW camp. After Wang Xianzhang's friend Wang Xiang escaped, he was hung up and severely beaten by special agent elements. However, he said: "I would rather die outside the barbed wire than die in the hands of special agents." He finally endured the pain and climbed over four barbed wire fences to escape.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 23rd: Today, the Korean-Chinese side once again failed to carry out explanation work. Kim Ying-soo, the Korean People's Army POW who returned this morning, escaped from Camp 50, which the Korean-Chinese side had proposed for explanation.
    Kim Ying-soo said that on the 18th and 19th, when the special agent elements coerced the POWs to hold "anti-explanation demonstrations," the special agent elements estimated that the Indian troops would at least surround the camp as they had dealt with Camp 48 two days earlier, so they prepared delay tactics. They did not expect the Indian troops to stand far outside the two layers of barbed wire and watch, as usual. During the "march" on the 19th, Kim Ying-soo only saw an Indian officer approach the barbed wire and say a few words to a Syngman Rhee special agent "battalion commander" before leaving. The special agent elements in the camp then told the POWs that the Indian soldiers were no longer prepared to make the POWs listen to the explanation. The special agent "battalion commander" of Camp 50 even said: "We received a notice from Seoul saying that the Indian Custodial Forces have been ordered not to use force to compel POWs to listen to explanations, so as long as we delay day by day, the 90-day deadline will pass, and we can go to South Korea."
    Another returnee, Che Yisan, said that when Camp 48 was surrounded, the special agents of Camp 51 thought that it would soon be their turn to listen to the explanation, and they were very panicked. They ordered every eight POWs to make a yellow flag, ready to use it when going out to listen to the explanation. Later, seeing that the Indian troops surrounding the camp had withdrawn, the special agent elements ordered the POWs to throw away the flags and decided to resist.
    Returnees revealed that after the explanation work was interrupted, the activities of the special agents became even more rampant. All special agents in the People's Army POW camps under the custody of the Indian troops were ordered to establish "Kill-Communists Teams" and "Anti-Explanation Classes." The "Kill-Communists Teams" specialized in investigating and monitoring the POWs' thoughts and actions. Some POWs who expressed concern about the explanation work were arrested and severely beaten in the "Guard Team" tents. A pit was dug in the "Guard Team" tent of Camp 50, and the person being tortured was tied up and thrown into the pit to be severely beaten, so that his shouts would not be easily heard. Two days before Kim Ying-soo escaped, he saw a POW being carried out to the toilet by two "Guard Team members." This person had been beaten so badly that blood was flowing from his mouth and nose, and he could not even squat down when defecating. In addition to the original "Guard Team" working overtime, the special agent armed forces in the camp also added "Patrol Teams." The special agent leaders ordered: POWs are not allowed to go to a place two meters away from the barbed wire during the day, and are not allowed to approach a place three meters away from the barbed wire at night. Many POWs who inadvertently walked into the "restricted area" were severely beaten.
    Kim Ying-soo said: "I had been hoping for the explanation work to start soon so that I could freely express my will and safely return to the embrace of the Republic. However, the Syngman Rhee special agents are stepping up their sabotage of the explanation work, and the Indian troops have not taken action quickly, so I decided to risk climbing out of the barbed wire and running back."

### 二十三日遣返归来的我被俘人员揭露  美方特务阻挠解释工作得逞后愈加猖狂

    二十三日遣返归来的我被俘人员揭露
    美方特务阻挠解释工作得逞后愈加猖狂
    【新华社开城二十三日电】今天遣返归来的三名朝鲜人民军被俘人员在板门店说：当印度看管部队还不来带我们出去听解释的时候，除了跳铁丝网出来要求遣返外，没有别的办法可以达到回家的愿望。
    今天和他们一同被遣返回来的还有三名中国人民志愿军被俘人员，其中两人也是跳铁丝网跑出来的，另外一名就是六天前在解释帐篷中停留了三小时而未被遣返的岳黑旦。
    朝鲜人民军归来人员金应洙是从五十号营场逃出来的，这个营场是我方已提出要进行解释的朝鲜人民军被俘人员营场之一。金应洙说，自从十六日四十八号营场特务阻止战俘听取解释以后，五十号营场的特务就兴高采烈地说：“我们也要坚决阻止战俘去听解释，印度部队不敢进营场来。一个营场拖几天，九十天的解释期一过去，李承晚总统就可以接我们出去了。”金应洙说，他准备在十九日那天听解释时要求遣返，但印度兵没有进营场来，他只得冒着危险翻铁丝网跑出来。他说：特务分子强迫战俘全部脱去上衣，胳膊挽胳膊，不让一个人去听解释。只要印度部队进去，就能把战俘们带出来听解释。
    朝鲜人民军归来人员都说，自从解释工作中断后，营场里的特务更加紧了暴力统治。特务武装“警备队”绕着铁丝网每隔几公尺就设一个岗哨，监视战俘行动。另外还专门派出“巡逻队”，日夜巡逻，防止战俘逃跑。有许多人因为表示愿意听解释，被特务分子在夜间吊起来毒打。
    志愿军归来人员王祥和王宪章都是从战俘营的“医院”里逃出来的。王宪章在他的朋友王祥逃走后，就被特务分子吊起来毒打。但是，他说：“我宁愿死在铁丝网外面，也不愿死在特务手中。”他终于忍着创痛，爬过四道铁丝网跑了出来。
    【新华社开城二十三日电】今天朝中方面又未能进行解释工作，上午归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员金应洙就是从朝中方面曾提出要进行解释的第五十号营场逃出来的。
    金应洙说，十八、十九两日，当特务分子胁迫战俘举行“反对解释游行示威”时，特务分子估计印度部队至少会像两天以前对付四十八号营场一样，把营场包围起来，因此曾准备了拖延的办法，没有想到印度部队和平时一样，远远地站在两层铁丝网外面看看。金应洙在十九日“游行”时，只看见一个印度军官走近铁丝网和一个李承晚特务“大队长”讲了几句话就走开了。营场里的特务分子就对战俘说，印度兵已经不准备使战俘去听取解释了。五十号营场的特务“大队长”甚至说：“我们接到汉城来的通知说，印度看管部队已奉命不得使用武力强迫战俘去听解释，因此只要我们一天天地拖下去，九十天的期限过去，就可以到南朝鲜去了。”
    另一位归来人员车益三说，当四十八号营场被包围时，五十一号营场的特务以为很快就要临到他们去听解释了，都非常惊慌，并曾命令每八名战俘赶制一面黄旗，准备在出去听解释时使用。后来，看到包围营场的印度部队撤走了，特务分子就命令战俘把旗子丢掉，决心抗拒了。
    归来人员揭露说，解释工作中断后，特务们的活动更加猖狂了。所有在印度部队看管下的人民军被俘人员营场中的特务都得到命令，要成立“灭共队”和“反对解释班”。“灭共队”专门调查和监视被俘人员的思想行动。有些被俘人员表示了对解释工作的关心，就被抓到“警备队”的帐篷里毒打。五十号营场“警备队”的帐篷里挖有一个土坑，受刑的人被捆起来丢到土坑里毒打，这样他的呼喊声就不容易传出来。金应洙在逃出来的前两天看见一个战俘被两个“警备队员”架着出来上厕所，这个人已经被打得口鼻流血，大便时都不能蹲下去。此外，营场里的特务武装除了原来的“警备队”加班站岗外，又增加了“巡查队”。特务头子下令：白天不准战俘到距铁丝网二公尺的地方，夜晚不准走近距铁丝网三公尺的地方。许多无意走进“禁区”的战俘都要遭到毒打。
    金应洙说：“我在很早以前就盼望解释工作赶快开始，以便能够自由表达意愿，安全地回到共和国怀抱。但是李承晚特务正在加紧破坏解释工作，印度军队也没有很快采取行动，所以我才决定冒险爬出铁丝网跑回来。”
