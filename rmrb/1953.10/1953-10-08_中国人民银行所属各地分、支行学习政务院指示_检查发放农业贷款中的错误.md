Following the Central People's Government State Council's promulgation of the "Instructions on Issuing Agricultural Loans" on September 2, the branches, sub-branches, and business offices of the People's Bank of China in various regions have conscientiously studied it under the leadership of local Party committees and governments.

During the study, various localities universally examined many erroneous ideas and practices in past agricultural loan work. The Fuqing sub-branch in Fujian Province, fearing that loans would not be recovered, only lent to wealthy farmers, and lent little or nothing to poor farmers. Parts of the county suffered severe drought this summer, but some people dared not lend agricultural loans to disaster victims. The Tongxian and Xianghe branches in Hebei Province, failing to proceed from the actual needs of poor farmers, held the idea that the shorter the loan term, the better. Summer topdressing loans, issued before wheat planting, were even stipulated to be repaid after wheat harvesting. Equipment loans were originally stipulated to be repaid in one to three years, but the Huairou sub-branch mostly stipulated that they be repaid within one year. Some cadres of the Echeng sub-branch in Hubei Province mechanically interpreted that loans should be used for production and did not lend livelihood loans to poor farmers. According to a typical survey of eight villages in six townships in the Fifth District, at least seventy poor farmers did not receive loans during the spring famine this year, and borrowed green seedling money at high interest rates of twenty percent per month. Zhai Jinmao, a poor peasant in Xuetangxia Township, Huangmei County, had his mother die and his wife fall ill. Unable to borrow money from the bank, he had no choice but to sell two dou and five sheng of land and borrow 200,000 yuan at high interest.

Subjectivism in agricultural loan work was also relatively serious. Agricultural loan plans were not based on the actual needs of farmers. As a result, what farmers urgently needed was not loaned or loaned very little, while what farmers did not need was loaned a lot. Due to the emphasis on earmarked funds and the use of lending physical objects or transfers to restrict farmers from "random" use, forced orders were fostered, increasing the burden on the masses. Farmers in Wuwei County, Gansu Province, requested hemp seed loans, but the county bank had no such loan in its plan, only livestock loans, and stipulated that payment would only be made with a tax receipt. Because farmers urgently needed hemp seeds for planting, some borrowed livestock from relatives, paid taxes, and bought hemp seeds after borrowing money with the tax receipt. In Hexi District, Jiuquan County, the province forbade farmers who were loaned money to buy iron shovels to buy ploughshares. In the past, it was also common to emphasize lending to mutual aid and cooperative organizations and not to individual farmers, wanting to use loans to promote the organization of farmers. In some areas, loans were only allowed to be used to buy public property, resulting in public livestock being used by people but not fed, becoming thin and uncared for. In some areas, loans were blindly concentrated on organized farmers, and because they exceeded their income, they were too heavily indebted to repay, and the morale of the members was low. This, on the one hand, affected the production enthusiasm of individual farmers, and on the other hand, violated the principles of voluntary mutual benefit and steady development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Resolution on the Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement" in March, cadres in various localities have somewhat changed these practices. Through this study, they have clearly realized ideologically that the issuance and recovery of agricultural loans in the future must proceed from the principles of assisting poor peasants, developing agricultural production, combating usury, and consolidating middle peasants, overcome subjectivism, and proceed from the actual conditions of the local area. Many regions have also proposed to strengthen research work, frequently understand and grasp the rural production and farmers' living conditions, not miss the agricultural season, be realistic, and correctly implement the State Council's instructions, so as not to turn good deeds into bad deeds. Cadres of the Zhangyan business office in Jinshan, Jiangsu, criticized the erroneous view that financial work had nothing to do, just running errands, and reversed the mood of not being at ease with their work. The Jiangjin sub-branch in Sichuan is discussing and studying how to simplify agricultural loan procedures.

At present, banks in various regions are beginning to study and improve working methods, and implement the spirit of the State Council's instructions into autumn loan collection, autumn ploughing and planting, and disaster relief and production in disaster areas. (Hao Risheng)

    中国人民银行所属各地分、支行学习政务院指示
    检查发放农业贷款中的错误
    中央人民政府政务院于九月二日公布了“关于发放农业贷款的指示”以后，中国人民银行所属各地分、支行，营业所，在当地党、政府领导下，都认真地进行了学习。
    在学习中，各地普遍地检查了过去对农贷工作的许多错误思想和作法。福建省福清支行，怕贷了收不回来，只贷给富裕的农民，不贷给或少贷给贫困的农民，该县部分地区今夏旱灾较重，有些人却不敢把农贷贷给灾民。河北通县、香河两行，不从贫困农民实际需要出发，存在着贷款期限越短越好的思想，夏季追肥贷款，麦前贷出，竟规定麦后归还。设备性贷款本来规定一年至三年偿还，怀柔支行却大部分规定为一年还清。湖北鄂城支行有些干部机械地理解贷款应用于生产，不贷给贫困农民生活贷款，据五区六个乡八个村的典型调查，今年春荒时至少有七十户贫苦农民没有得到贷款，曾以月息二十分的高利贷借青苗钱。黄梅县学堂下乡贫农翟金茂母死妻病，没有向银行借到钱，没有办法卖田二斗五升，并借高利贷二十万元。
    在农贷工作方面的主观主义作风也是比较严重的。农贷计划不是根据农民实际需要编制的，结果，农民普遍迫切需要的却没有贷款或贷得很少；农民不需要的反而贷得很多。由于强调专款专用，和用贷放实物或转账的办法来限制农民“乱”用，也助长了强迫命令的发生，加重了群众的负担。甘肃武威县农民要求麻籽贷款，但该县银行计划上没有此项贷款，只有耕畜贷款，并规定必须有税票才付款。农民因急需麻籽种地，有的把亲戚的牲口借来上了税，凭税票借到款后买了麻籽。该省酒泉县河西区贷给群众买铁锨的钱不准买犁铧。过去并普遍地强调贷给互助合作组织，不贷给个体农民，想以贷款促使农民组织起来。有些地区的贷款只准用来买公共财产，结果公共牲口只有人用，没有人喂，饿瘦了没有人管。有些地区盲目地把贷款集中贷给组织起来的农民，因超过了他们的收入，负债过重无法归还，组员情绪低落。这样一方面影响了个体农民的生产积极性，另一方面也违反了互助合作运动的自愿互利原则及稳步发展的方针。在三月份中共中央发布了“关于农业生产互助合作运动的决议”后，各地干部对这些作法已有所转变，通过这次学习，思想上明确认识到今后农贷工作的发放与收回，必须从扶助贫农，发展农业生产和打击高利贷，巩固中农的方针出发，克服主观主义作风，作到从当地实际情况出发。很多地区还提出要加强研究工作，经常了解掌握农村生产与农民生活情况，要不误农时，切合实际，正确贯彻政务院指示，不把好事办成坏事。江苏金山张堰营业所干部，批判了过去认为金融工作没有什么作头，只是跑跑腿的错误看法，扭转了不安心工作的情绪。四川江津支行正在讨论研究如何简化农贷手续。
    现在各地银行，正在开始研究改进工作方法，将政务院指示的精神贯彻到秋季收贷、秋耕秋种及灾区生产救灾等工作中去。　（蒿日升）
