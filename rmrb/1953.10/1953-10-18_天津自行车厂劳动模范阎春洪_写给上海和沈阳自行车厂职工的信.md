    Labor Model of Tianjin Bicycle Factory, Yan Chunhong, Writes a Letter to Workers of Shanghai and Shenyang Bicycle Factories
    Comrades of the Shanghai Bicycle Factory and Shenyang Bicycle Factory:
    Every day when we go to and from work, we see thousands of cadres, workers, and students riding bicycles to their offices, factories, schools, or homes. On Sundays, how many people ride bicycles freely to the places they want to go? At present, the production capacity of our bicycle factory still cannot keep up with the needs of the people. The people are asking us to produce more lightweight, durable, and beautiful bicycles for them.
    In order to meet the people's ardent hopes, and in order to respond to the country's call for increasing production and practicing economy, the workers in our factory have proposed: resolutely complete the task of increasing production of 12,000 "Flying Pigeon" brand bicycles for the country in the fourth quarter. Now every workshop and work team in the factory has formulated its own specific action plan. Everyone guarantees to give full play to their high enthusiasm and the wisdom of the working class to successfully and over-fulfill our task of increasing production and practicing economy.
    In the past, in our workshop, all the dull work (referring to the work that needs to be punched and pressed – editor's note) had to be fed manually. This not only could not guarantee safe production, but also prevented the machine's operating speed from being fully utilized, and the output was greatly limited. Our bicycle production process has more than 2,000 large and small procedures (our second workshop alone has more than 400 procedures), and many molds are required for production. To increase production, we must start by transforming the original equipment and shortening the original processes as much as possible.
    Last May, with the assistance of comrades Gao Futong and others, I overcame many difficulties and made the first automatic punching machine and other molds for punching front and rear axle cups, simplifying the operation process, ensuring product quality, eliminating accidents, and increasing output by 95 percent. In March this year, Soviet expert Comrade Ivanov came to our factory for the second time and reminded us to convert a large number of original equipment into automated molds, and asked us to trial-produce automatic rotary table molds and multi-head molds to ensure safe production, implement multi-machine management, and further improve production efficiency. We felt that the Soviet expert's suggestions were exactly what we had in mind. However, because he did not stay in the factory for a long time, we had to figure out some specific technical problems ourselves, which was difficult. But because we already had the experience of trial-producing relatively simple automatic molds last year, we had great confidence. In May, I learned that a comrade was passing through Tianjin and brought a Soviet "Mold Drawing," so I borrowed it overnight and looked at it carefully for a day, and my mind suddenly opened up. Then, I worked with the workers, working day and night, and not even resting on Tuesdays (we rest on Tuesdays), designing and trying to make complex automatic molds. Through everyone's efforts, in August, we made a multi-head automatic punching machine and an automatic rotary table mold for manufacturing front fork cups. In this way, parts that need to be punched with several holes can be punched out at once; parts that need to be bent several times can be bent at once; some molds that cannot be "automated" can be made with automatic rotary table molds. And some processes were merged. Our output has been greatly increased. For example, mudguard struts used to require two processes to bend, and each process only produced one piece; now the processes are merged into one, and nine pieces can be bent at a time, increasing production efficiency by 449.9 percent. After the front and rear brake clips were changed to automatic bending, production efficiency increased by 200 percent.
    We know that the degree of automation in our production is still far from enough, and many molds that can be transformed have not been transformed. Although the work of feeding the punching machine is no longer done by hand, as long as the material is placed in the vertical tube on the machine tool, it will automatically slide to the punch head and automatically come out; but the work of adding material to the vertical tube still requires manual labor. In order to save more manpower and create more wealth for the country, we must further promote the experience we have gained in production automation.
    Now, we put forward the following guarantees: First, we will continue to work hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and in the fourth quarter labor competition, we will transform the two molds for making pedal cups and bottom bracket washers into multi-head automatic molds; we will transform the four molds for making saddle inner pads, outer pads, pedal shafts, etc. into automatic molds; we will install automatic feeding slides on the automatic molds for making front and rear axle cups; and we will gradually implement multi-machine management. Second, we will try to shorten the occupancy of nine kinds of parts as much as possible within October, accelerate the production process, and save the country more than 579 million yuan of wealth. Our workshop will also strive to improve operating techniques and use waste materials to make small parts, saving the country more than 87 million yuan of materials in October. Finally, in order to ensure the completion of the above plan, we have and will continue to deeply mobilize the masses to establish and improve various related systems, such as implementing group specialization and responsibility system, and weekly inspection, summary and regular reporting system.
    Comrades, our working conditions and equipment may not be completely the same; our plans for increasing production and practicing economy may not be as high as yours; our achievements and experience in production may not be as much as yours. However, we are willing to tell you our plans, tell them to the people of the whole country, so that everyone can supervise us in implementing the plans; and we are willing to know your plans and methods for increasing production and practicing economy, so as to humbly learn from your advanced experience and improve our work. At the end of the year, we will also report on the completion of the plan. Let us join hands and move forward together to complete and over-fulfill the country's plan!
    Yan Chunhong, Special-Class Labor Model of Tianjin City, Deputy Director of the Second Workshop of Tianjin Bicycle Factory

    天津自行车厂劳动模范阎春洪
    写给上海和沈阳自行车厂职工的信上海自行车厂沈阳自行车厂职工同志们：
    每天我们上下班的时候，都看到成千成百的干部、工人、学生骑着自行车上机关、工厂、学校或者回家去。星期天，又有多少人骑着自行车，自由自在地向自己要去的地方去。目前，我们自行车厂的生产能力，还是赶不上人民的需要。人民要求我们为他们生产更多的轻巧、耐用、美观的自行车。
    为了满足人民殷切的希望，为了响应祖国增产节约的号召，我们厂里的职工提出：坚决完成第四季度为国家增产一万二千辆“飞鸽”牌自行车的任务。现在厂里每个车间和工班都订出了自己具体的行动计划。大家保证要发挥高度的热情和工人阶级的智慧，胜利地并超额地完成我们增产节约的任务。
    从前，我们这个车间，一切闷工活（指需要冲、压的活——编者）都要用手去喂料。这不但不能保证安全生产，而且还使机器的运转速度不能高度发挥，产量受到很大限制。咱们生产自行车的过程大小工序有两千来道（仅仅我们第二车间的工序就有四百多道），生产需用的模具繁多。要提高产量，也就必须从改造原有设备、尽可能地缩短原有工序入手。
    去年五月，我在工人高富桐等同志的协助下，克服了很多困难，制出了第一部冲制前后轴碗自动冲床等模具，简化了操作过程，保证了产品质量，杜绝了事故，提高了产量百分之九十五。今年三月间，苏联专家伊凡诺夫同志第二次来到我厂，提醒我们要把原有设备大量改装为自动化模具，要我们试制自动转盘式冲模和多头冲模，保证安全生产，实行多机床管理，进一步提高生产效率。我们觉得苏联专家的建议完全说到了我们的心坎里。可是因为他没有在厂久停，一些具体的技术问题要靠我们自己去揣摩，这是有困难的。但是因为我们已经有了去年试制比较简单的自动冲模的经验，信心很高。五月间，我知道有一位同志路过天津，带了一本苏联“冲模图样”，就连夜去借来，细细看了一天，脑子豁朗一下开了窍。接着，我和工人们一起，熬夜打黄昏，星期二（我们是星期二休息）也不休息，一面设计，一面试作复杂的自动模具。经过大家的努力，到了八月份，我们做出了制造前叉碗的多头自动冲床和自动转盘冲模。这样，需要冲几种孔眼的零件，就可以一次冲出；需要几次压弯的零件，就可以一次压弯；有些冲模不能“自动化”的，就用自动转盘冲模去作。并把有些工序合并了起来。我们的产量大大提高了，如挡泥板支棍，过去需要经过两道工序才能压弯，而且每道工序只出一根活；现在把工序合并成了一道，一次能压九根，生产效率提高了百分之四百四十九点九。前后闸卡子改成自动压弯后，生产效率提高了百分之二百。
    我们知道，现在我们生产中自动化的程度还很不够，很多可以改装的模具还没改装过来。给冲床喂活的工作虽不再用手了，只要把材料放在机床上的立筒里，它就会自动溜到冲头下，又自动跑出来；但是向立筒加料的工作还要靠人工去作。为了节省更多的人力，为了给国家创造更多的财富，我们要把过去在生产自动化方面摸索到的经验，进一步加以推广。
    现在，我们提出以下保证：首先，继续努力学习苏联先进经验，在第四季度劳动竞赛中，把制脚蹬碗、中轴垫圈的两种模具改造成多头自动冲模；把制鞍子内垫、外垫、脚蹬轴等的冲模四件改成自动冲模；把制前、后轴碗的自动冲模上装设起自动送料的滑道；并逐步实行多机床管理。其次，在十月份内把九种零件的占用量尽量缩短，加速生产过程，为国家节约五亿七千九百余万元的财富。我们车间还要努力改进操作技术，利用废料作小零件，在十月份内给国家节约八千七百余万元的材料。最后，为了保证上述计划的完成，我们已经并将继续深入发动群众，建立与健全各种有关制度，如实行小组专业化和专责制，和每周的检查、总结与经常的汇报制度等。
    同志们，咱们的工作情况和设备条件也许不完全相同；我们的增产节约计划也许没有你们的高；我们生产中的成就和经验也许没有你们的多。但是，我们愿意把我们的计划告诉你们，告诉给全国人民，让大家来监督我们执行计划；并愿意知道你们增产节约的计划和办法，以便虚心学习你们的先进经验，提高我们的工作。到了年底，我们还要报告计划的完成情况。让我们携起手来，共同为完成和超额完成国家的计划而前进吧！
