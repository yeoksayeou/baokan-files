Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 10th. With the support and assistance of the U.S. military authorities, the Chiang Kai-shek gang has already abducted more than sixty captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers to Taiwan on the 8th. These soldiers were previously kidnapped from POW camps in June this year through a conspiracy between the Chiang and Li gangs. News from the Chiang gang's news agency revealed that these captured personnel from our side were transported by plane from the U.S. military-controlled Busan airport to Taiwan under the escort of Chiang gang special agents, who were mixed among the POWs and dispatched by the U.S. side. The news also revealed that one of the Chiang gang special agents escorting our captured personnel was Fei Yulin, who had already been exposed by our returning personnel as having participated in the conspiracy to abduct these captured personnel from our side. According to Li Honggen, a returned captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, on June 21st this year, at 4:00 PM, in order to assist Chiang gang special agents in abducting captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers detained in the Dongnae POW camp in Busan, the U.S. military authorities dispatched U.S. troops to throw many poison gas bombs into the camp. Fei Yulin and other Chiang gang special agents took advantage of the POWs scattering to avoid the poison gas to abduct a large number of POWs and escort them to the Li gang's police station in Dongnae. The next day, the Chiang gang's "embassy" in South Korea sent many plainclothes agents to force the POWs to change clothes and then imprison them separately in Busan.

    The Chiang gang's criminal act of abducting POWs to Taiwan is related to the recent trip to South Korea by U.S. "Ambassador" to the Chiang gang, Rankin. According to news obtained here, Rankin's mission was to facilitate the transportation of these sixty-plus POWs to Taiwan and to further plan the abduction of Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs who are not directly repatriated to Taiwan and Okinawa. The news also said that the U.S. side is preparing to first abduct Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs who are not directly repatriated to Okinawa, conduct "screening," and then transport some of the POWs to Taiwan to be handed over to the Chiang gang to serve as cannon fodder, while the other part will remain in Okinawa where the U.S. military will forcibly conduct military training. Rankin traveled from Taipei to Tokyo, and then from Tokyo to Seoul and Munsan in order to plan this major conspiracy. The Chiang gang also dispatched special agent chief Lin Wei to accompany Rankin to Tokyo for activities. Rankin's criminal activities fully confirm that the U.S. side is supporting and assisting the Chiang and Li gangs in abducting POWs under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Recently, Chiang and Li special agents mixed in the Neutral Nations supervision camp have repeatedly created riot incidents and attacked Indian troops. The Chiang and Li gangs have openly clamored to "liberate" the POWs under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, taking advantage of these incidents. These facts clearly show that the large-scale conspiracy being planned by the Chiang and Li gangs to abduct POWs is underway. Hamblen, the U.S. repatriation group leader, recently issued a letter to the POWs, hypocritically advising them not to "riot" or "escape," which is obviously a pre-emptive attempt by the U.S. side to shirk responsibility for this serious act of sabotage of the armistice agreement being arranged by the Chiang and Li gangs.

    People here pointed out that the Korean and Chinese side reserves the full right to demand that the U.S. side retrieve the more than 27,000 Korean and Chinese POWs abducted by the Syngman Rhee gang in June of this year. The U.S. side must not evade the responsibility of retrieving the more than sixty Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs who were transported to Taiwan. At the same time, the U.S. side must bear full responsibility for any "escape" incidents of POWs currently under the supervision of Indian troops and bear the serious consequences arising therefrom.

    六十多名志愿军被俘人员被蒋匪帮劫往台湾
    开城我方人士指出美方逃避不了应负责任
    【新华社开城十日电】    在美军当局的支持和协助下，蒋匪帮已在八日把在今年六月间被蒋李匪帮合谋从战俘营架走的六十多名中国人民志愿军被俘人员劫往台湾。蒋匪帮通讯社的消息透露，这些我方被俘人员是在美方派遣的混在战俘中间的蒋匪特务押解之下，被用飞机从美军当局控制的釜山飞机场运往台湾的。这个消息还透露，押解我方被俘人员的蒋匪特务之一，就是早已被我方归来人员所揭露的参预劫走这些我方被俘人员阴谋的蒋匪特务费玉林。据遣返归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员李洪根揭露：今年六月二十一日下午四时，美军当局为了协助蒋匪特务劫走拘禁在釜山东莱战俘营内的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，派遣美军部队向营场里投掷许多毒气弹，费玉林与其他蒋匪特务就乘着战俘四散躲避毒气之际把大批战俘架走，并将他们押到东莱的李匪警察局内。第二天，蒋匪驻南朝鲜“大使馆”就送去许多便衣，强迫战俘改装后把他们分散囚禁在釜山市内。
    蒋匪帮将战俘劫往台湾的罪恶行动，是与美国驻蒋匪帮“大使”兰金最近的南朝鲜之行有关的。据此间获得的消息说，兰金的任务是促成将这六十多名战俘运往台湾，并进一步策划将不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员劫往台湾和冲绳岛。消息还说，美方准备把不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员先劫往冲绳岛，进行“甄别”以后再把一部分战俘运往台湾移交给蒋匪帮充当炮灰，另一部分留在冲绳岛由美军强迫进行军事训练。兰金从台北到东京，再从东京到汉城和汶山就是为了策划这个重大的阴谋。蒋匪帮也派遣特务头子林蔚陪同兰金到达东京进行活动。兰金的这种罪恶活动，完全证实了美方正在支持和协助蒋李匪帮劫走中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘的阴谋。最近以来，混在中立国看管营场里的蒋李特务一再制造暴乱事件，袭击印度部队，蒋李匪帮利用这些事件公然叫嚣要“解放”中立国遣返委员会看管的战俘，这些事实清楚地表明蒋李匪帮正在策划的大规模劫走战俘的阴谋正在进行中。美方遣返组组长汉布伦最近发表致战俘信中，假惺惺地劝告战俘不要“骚动”或“逃跑”，显然是为美方对蒋李匪帮正在布置的这个严重破坏停战协定的行动预先推卸责任。
    此间人士指出：朝中方面保留着要求美方追回今年六月间被李承晚匪帮架走的两万七千多名朝中战俘的完全权利。对于被运往台湾的六十多名中国人民志愿军战俘，美方绝不能逃避追回他们的责任。同时，对于现在印度部队看管下的战俘的任何“逃跑”事件，美方必须负完全责任，并承担由此而引起的严重后果。
