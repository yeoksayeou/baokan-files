Construction of China's largest brick and tile factory—the Beijing Municipal State-owned Dou Dian Brick and Tile Factory—has been basically completed and partially put into production. According to the current production situation, after the factory is fully completed, the annual output of bricks alone can reach 140 million, which can be used to build 195 three-story buildings, each 15 meters wide and 40 meters long. Next year, the bricks and tiles produced by the factory will be supplied in large quantities to meet the needs of the capital's basic construction.

The Dou Dian Brick and Tile Factory is built in Liangxiang County, Hebei Province, fifty kilometers away from the capital, covering an area of more than 7,000 mu. The entire factory has two sixty-door and two fifty-four-door ring kilns, nine brick-making machines, two tile-making machines, two power distribution rooms, and a dedicated railway line within the factory, as well as a drying room that no other brick and tile factory in the country has. Among them, four ring kilns, five brick-making machines and part of the dedicated railway lines have been built, and the drying room has also been completed. With this drying room, brick and tile blanks do not need to be dried in the open air, and production can continue even on rainy days, so that annual production is not affected by the seasons.

    我国最大的窦店砖瓦厂建筑工程基本完成
    我国新建最大的砖瓦厂——北京市地方国营窦店砖瓦厂的建筑工程已经基本完成，并局部投入生产。根据现在的生产情况来看，这个厂全部建成后，仅是砖一项产品每年就能出产一亿四千万块，能用来建造十五公尺宽、四十公尺长的三层建筑物一百九十五幢。明年，该厂生产的砖瓦就将大量供应首都基本建设的需要。
    窦店砖瓦厂建设在离首都五十公里的河北省良乡县境内，占地约七千多亩。全厂拥有两座六十个门和两座五十四个门的轮窑、九台制砖机、两台制瓦机、两个配电室和厂内专用铁路线等设备，另外还有一个全国各砖瓦厂所没有的干燥室。其中四座轮窑、五台制砖机和部分专用铁路线已经建好，干燥室也已完成。有了这个干燥室，砖坯、瓦坯都不必放在露天里干燥，下雨天也能生产，这样，全年生产就不受季节影响。    （新华社）
