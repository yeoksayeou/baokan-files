Celebrating the Great National Day
Zhang Bojun, Chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party

Our people across the country are greeting the glorious National Day of our motherland with increasingly excited, joyful, and enthusiastic feelings. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of our great and wise leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, uniting all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, patriotic democratic individuals, and overseas Chinese, we have won extremely brilliant victories on all fronts through four years of continuous efforts and resolute struggle against enemies at home and abroad. This has brought about fundamental changes in the entire Chinese society. Our country has achieved unprecedented great unity of the people. People of all ethnic groups and strata have entered a new historical period of people's democracy and national equality. The lives of people of all strata across the country have gradually improved significantly, opening up a broad road of unlimited brightness. At the same time, the conspiracy of American imperialism to launch a war of aggression against Korea three years ago and to further invade our People's Republic of China has been crushed by the heroic Korean and Chinese people. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement in July this year is a great victory for the Korean and Chinese people, a great victory for the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and a great victory for the world's peace-loving forces.

China's independence, unity, and prosperity have not only changed the situation in Asia but also changed the situation in the world. As Malenkov said: "Now the People's Republic of China appears as a powerful stabilizing factor in Asia and the Pacific region... Another great power has emerged in the world, which, together with all peace-loving forces, is working to consolidate peace and international security. This is indeed one of the most important historical results in the international situation in recent decades, which not only illuminates the path that has been traveled but also illuminates the future."

Beginning in 1953, our motherland has entered a new historical period, and a new historical task has unfolded before the people of the whole country, which is the task of gradually realizing national industrialization and gradually transitioning to socialism. Chairman Mao instructed us: "Without industry, there will be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." The current construction of our country is to develop industry. The basic task of the first Five-Year Plan, which begins this year, is to first concentrate major efforts on developing heavy industry to lay the foundation for national industrialization and defense modernization, correspondingly cultivate construction talents, develop transportation, light industry, agriculture, and expand commerce, promote the collectivization of agriculture and handicrafts in a planned way, and transform private industry and commerce, and correctly leverage the role of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. The basic purpose is that, in the process of economic construction, the proportion of socialist components must continue to grow, the positive aspects of capitalist economy must be correctly utilized, and the worker-peasant alliance must be further consolidated.

This is a great and glorious task, and we have full confidence and conditions to achieve it. Because we have the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, we have the intelligent and brave working people, the unity and cooperation of all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations, the sincere assistance of the great Soviet Union, and the support of progressive people all over the world. These are the guarantees of the inevitable victory of our national construction.

Now, when the country is carrying out planned and large-scale construction, our democratic parties should promptly shift the focus of their work to promoting the active participation of members in national construction. Most of the members of the democratic parties and the masses they connect with have a certain level of cultural and technical expertise and shoulder important work in political and legal affairs, culture and education, and financial and economic construction. We must be good at inspiring and organizing their enthusiasm and creativity, and give play to their active and exemplary roles in practical work, to ensure the completion of national plans.

What is worth noting now is that, under the new era tasks, some people are still not good at combining politics and professional work in specific work. Because the past work of the democratic parties was accustomed to general political movements, they feel unfamiliar when transitioning to planned construction work. In fact, as the Guangming Daily editorial on August 30 pointed out, this is because "they do not know that economic construction with national industrialization as the goal and the cultural and educational construction that cooperates with it are the most important political tasks of the people of the whole country at present." Politics and professional work are inseparable. Political tasks are embodied through specific professional work, and specific professional work can only be done well with political leadership. In the future, our democratic parties must further face reality, face professional work, and use the strength of grassroots organizations to help members do a good job in their positions in professional departments. It can be affirmed that ensuring the completion of one's position work is specifically completing political tasks. Therefore, in the future, we should change the erroneous tendency of not studying professional work, being accustomed to empty talk of politics, and being divorced from reality, and at the same time, we should correct the purely professional viewpoint of being divorced from politics.

How can members of democratic parties ensure the completion of their position work? Experience has proven that: First, we must work in unity with the Communist Youth League and the trade union under the unified leadership of the Party committees and administrative organs at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party in order to successfully complete the tasks. Because national construction is carried out in a led and step-by-step manner, the leaders are the Communist Party and the People's Government, so our work must be carried out under the unified leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government. Second, it is necessary to continuously carry out the transformation and improvement of political thought, because the work attitude and work method of each person are determined by the domination of political thought. What we mean by using politics to guide professional work is to learn to use the stand, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism to carry out professional work. Whoever values ​​this aspect will be able to establish a master's attitude towards labor, consciously abide by national discipline, and do a good job in professional work. Conversely, he will easily develop bureaucracy, subjectivism and other erroneous phenomena in his work.

Political and ideological education is the central content of the democratic parties' own work in the future. We should use this as the center to enrich the content of organizational life, give specific help to members based on the ideological problems they show in their professional practice, and remove their ideological obstacles, so as to give play to their enthusiasm in their work. We can only use this as the content to better coordinate the professional work of our democratic parties with the work of the organs. Today, talking about political and ideological education is inseparable from learning from the Soviet Union. Chairman Mao once instructed us: "We are going to carry out great national construction. The work before us is arduous and our experience is insufficient. Therefore, we must earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Whether it is within the Communist Party, outside the Communist Party, veteran cadres, new cadres, technical personnel, intellectuals, and workers and peasant masses, they must sincerely learn from the Soviet Union. We must not only learn the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, but also learn the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union." We have achieved preliminary results in learning the Common Program and learning Marxism-Leninism Mao Zedong Thought in the past, and we should continue to adhere to it now. Undeniably, some members of the democratic parties still have vague thoughts, incorrect views, and rigid work methods. This shows the necessity of political and ideological education in the work of democratic parties.

The People's Daily editorial on September 6 pointed out: "This year is the first year of my country's first Five-Year Plan. Completing this year's plan is of extremely great significance to my country's current and long-term construction undertakings, and to its domestic and foreign influence. Therefore, we must increase production, increase income, practice strict economy, and tighten expenditures to ensure the victorious and over-fulfilled completion of the national plan." This requirement must also be implemented for all democratic parties. National construction is inseparable from practicing streamlining and economy. Today, although we have the sincere help of the great Soviet Union, we mainly rely on our own strength. Therefore, democratic parties should require their members and the masses they contact to unanimously implement the requirements of streamlining and economy in accordance with the country's current situation.

Now, our people across the country are cheering and applauding for the gradual realization of industrialization, the gradual socialist transformation, and the gradual transition to a socialist society in our great motherland. An infinitely magnificent prospect has unfolded before our motherland. We should unite closely, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, actively participate in national construction, strive to over-fulfill the plan, and march towards a glorious future.

    庆祝伟大的国庆节
    中国农工民主党主席  章伯钧
    我们全国人民是以一次比一次更为兴奋、愉快、热烈的心情来迎接祖国的光荣的国庆节。中华人民共和国建国后，在我们伟大英明的领袖毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，团结了全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体和爱国民主分子与海外侨胞，经过了四年来的不断努力和对国内外敌人的坚决斗争，不论在各个战线上都赢得了极辉煌的胜利，使中国整个社会都起了根本的改变，我们国家已经实现了史无前例的人民的伟大统一，各民族各阶层人民已经一齐进入了人民民主和民族平等的新的历史时期，全国各阶层人民的生活都已逐步地有了显著的提高和改进，开展了无限光明的广阔道路。同时美帝国主义于三年前发动侵略朝鲜的战争，并企图进一步侵犯我中华人民共和国的阴谋已经被英雄的朝中人民所击毁了。今年七月朝鲜停战协定的签订，就是朝中人民的伟大胜利，就是以苏联为首的民主阵营的伟大胜利，就是世界爱好和平力量的伟大胜利。
    中国的独立、统一和富强不仅改变了亚洲的形势，而且也改变了世界的形势。正如马林科夫所说的：“现在中华人民共和国以强大的稳定因素出现于亚洲和太平洋区域。……世界上出现了又一个大国，这个大国跟一切爱好和平的力量在一起，共同为巩固和平与国际安全而努力。这确实是近数十年来国际局势中的一个最重要的历史结果，这个结果不仅照亮了已经走过了的道路，而且也照亮了未来的前程。”
    从一九五三年开始，我们的祖国已经进入了一个新的历史时期，在全国人民面前展开了新的历史任务，这就是逐步实现国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义的任务。毛主席指示我们：“没有工业，就没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”当前我们国家的建设，就是发展工业。从今年开始的第一个五年计划的基本任务，就是首先集中主要力量发展重工业，以建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础，相应地培养建设人材，发展交通运输业、轻工业、农业和扩大商业，有步骤地促进农业和手工业的合作化和进行对私营工商业的改造，并正确地发挥个体农业、手工业和私营工商业的作用。其基本目的，就是在经济建设的过程中，必须使社会主义成份的比重不断增长，正确地利用资本主义经济的积极性，进一步巩固工农联盟。
    这是一个伟大的光荣的任务，我们完全有充分的信心和条件去实现它。因为我们有伟大领袖毛主席和中国共产党的领导，有聪明勇敢的劳动人民，有全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的团结和合作，有伟大的苏联的真诚援助，有全世界进步人类的支持。这些就是我们国家建设必然胜利的保证。
    现在，当国家进行有计划的、大规模建设的时候，我们民主党派应该及时地把自己的工作重心转移到推动成员积极参加国家建设上来。民主党派的成员和所联系的群众，多数具有一定的文化技术水平，在政法、文教、财经建设中担负着重要的工作；必须善于启发和组织他们的积极性、创造性，发挥他们在实际工作中的积极作用和模范作用，保证国家计划的完成。
    现在值得注意的，是在新的时代任务下，有些人还不善于在具体工作上把政治与业务结合起来。因为民主党派过去的工作，都是习惯于一般性的政治运动，现在转入到有计划的建设工作时，便感到了生疏。其实这正如光明日报八月三十日社论中所指出的都是由于“他们不知道以国家工业化为奋斗目标的经济建设和与之配合的文教建设，是全国人民当前最重大的政治任务”。政治与业务是分不开的，政治任务是通过具体业务来体现的，而具体业务又是靠政治的领导才能做好的。我们民主党派今后须要进一步地面向实际，面向业务，通过基层组织的力量以帮助成员搞好业务机关的岗位工作。可以肯定地说，保证完成自己的岗位工作，就是具体地完成政治任务。因此，今后应该改变不钻研业务，习惯于空谈政治，脱离实际的错误倾向，同时也应该纠正脱离政治的单纯的业务观点。
    民主党派的成员又如何才能保证完成自己的岗位工作呢？从已往的经验证明：第一，必须在中国共产党的各级党委和行政机关的统一领导下，与青年团、工会团结一起进行工作才能胜利完成任务。因为国家建设是有领导地有步骤地进行的，领导者就是共产党和人民政府，所以我们的工作必须在共产党和人民政府的统一领导下进行。第二，就是不间断地进行政治思想的改造与提高，因为每个人的工作态度与工作方法如何，都是决定于政治思想的支配。我们所谓用政治指导业务，就是要学习用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法来进行业务。凡是在这方面重视了的，他就能建立主人翁的劳动态度，自觉地遵守国家纪律，搞好业务。反之，他在工作上就会容易发生官僚主义、主观主义和其他错误现象。
    政治思想教育工作，是今后民主党派本身业务的中心内容。我们应该以此为中心来充实组织生活的内容，根据成员在业务实践中所表现的思想问题给予具体帮助，扫除他们的思想障碍，以发挥其工作上的积极性。我们也只能以此为内容，才能使我们民主党派的业务工作更好的与机关工作配合起来。今天，谈政治思想教育工作与学习苏联是分不开的。毛主席曾经指示我们：“我们要进行伟大的国家建设，我们面前的工作是艰苦的，我们的经验是不够的，因此，要认真学习苏联的先进经验。无论共产党内、共产党外、老干部、新干部、技术人员、知识分子以及工人群众和农民群众，都必须诚心诚意地向苏联学习。我们不仅要学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，而且要学习苏联先进的科学技术。”我们过去学习共同纲领，学习马列主义毛泽东思想曾经获得初步的成绩，现在应该继续坚持下去。无可否认的，在民主党派的成员中，思想模糊，观点不正，工作方法生硬的还是有的。这就说明了政治思想教育在民主党派工作中的必要性。
    今年九月六日人民日报的社论中指出：“今年是我国第一个五年计划的头一个年度。完成今年的计划，无论对于我国当前的和长远的建设事业来说，无论对于国内外的影响来说，都是有极其重大的意义的。因此，必须增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支，以保证国家计划胜利地、超额地完成。”这一要求，对各民主党派同样是要贯彻实施的。进行国家建设与厉行精简节约分不开的，今天，我们虽然有伟大的苏联的真诚帮助，但主要还靠自己的力量。所以民主党派应该根据国家当前的情况，要所属成员和所联系的群众一致地贯彻执行精简节约的要求。
    现在，我们全国人民正为伟大的祖国逐步实现工业化，逐步进行社会主义的改造，逐步过渡到社会主义的社会而欢呼鼓舞。在我们祖国的面前展开了无限壮丽的前景。我们应该紧密地团结起来，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，积极地参加国家建设，争取超额完成计划，迈进光荣的前途。
