    Chen Jinyu and other farmers from Binkou Township, Jianyang County, rescue state property in the flood
    Readers Ge Degui and Kang Zhenqin wrote: On August 16th and 17th, heavy rain fell continuously in Binkou Township, Jianyang County, Fujian Province, and the Binkou River flooded. The Fujian Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau had more than 1,200 fir logs piled on the bank of the Binkou River. On the morning of the 17th, Chen Jinyu, the militia captain of Binkou Township, and Hong Bingquan, the head of the mutual aid team, discovered that more than 400 fir logs on the pile had been washed away by the flood. They did not bother to check the crops in their fields, and immediately mobilized 30 farmers to rescue the state's timber in the flood. They drove the ferry boat into the river and used thick coir ropes to block the fir logs floating in the river to the shore. As a result of their brave rescue, a total of more than 300 fir logs were rescued, reducing losses to the state. This spirit of cherishing state property is worthy of praise.

    建阳县滨口乡农民陈金玉等在洪水中抢救国家财产
    读者葛德贵、康振钦来信：八月十六、十七两日，福建省建阳县滨口乡连下大雨，滨口河洪水暴涨。福建省森林工业局有一千二百多根杉木堆在滨口河边堆栈上。十七日早晨，滨口乡民兵中队长陈金玉和互助组长洪炳泉发现堆栈上的杉木已被洪水冲走了四百多根，他们顾不得去看自己田地里的庄稼，马上发动了三十个农民到洪水中去抢救国家的木材。他们把渡船赶到河中，用粗大的棕绳把在河里漂流的杉木拦到靠岸边来。由于他们奋勇抢救的结果，总共抢救起三百多根杉木，使国家减少了损失。这种爱护国家财产的精神是值得表扬的。
