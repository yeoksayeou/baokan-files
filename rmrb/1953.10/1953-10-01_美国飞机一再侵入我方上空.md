Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 29th: Secretary-General Zhu Ran of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, a Senior Colonel, demanded on September 29th that the U.S. side seriously address the incident of U.S. military aircraft violating the armistice agreement by intruding into the airspace over Kaesong on the evening of the 28th. He also requested that the U.S. side immediately take measures to prevent such incidents from happening again. At approximately 7:30 PM on the evening of the 28th, a U.S. military twin-engine aircraft crossed the Han River from the southeast and intruded into the brightly lit Kaesong. It flew low over the city, and the sound of the engine could be heard throughout the city, reminding people of the situation before the signing of the armistice agreement when U.S. military aircraft intruded into the airspace over Kaesong. After circling over Kaesong and Tuchengli southwest of Kaesong, the aircraft flew back to the U.S. side. On the same day, the U.S. side admitted at the meeting of the secretaries of both sides of the Military Armistice Commission to two incidents of U.S. military aircraft violating the armistice agreement by intruding into the airspace over our area and expressed regret. However, that evening, this obvious and deliberate violation of the armistice agreement occurred again.
	On the same day, Secretary-General Zhu Ran of the Korean-Chinese side also raised another incident of U.S. military aircraft violating the armistice agreement by intruding into the airspace over our area, requesting the U.S. side to pay attention to it. At approximately 7:20 AM on the 27th, a U.S. military aircraft flew across the military demarcation line from due south and intruded into the airspace over Chianhyon south of Kimhwa, circling in the vicinity before flying back to the U.S. side from due south.
      Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 30th: At the meeting of the secretaries of both sides of the Military Armistice Commission on September 30th, our Secretary-General Zhu Ran raised the issue of three incidents of U.S. military aircraft violating the armistice agreement by intruding into the airspace over our area on the 27th, requesting the U.S. side to pay attention to it.
