    Over the past three years, Shanghai's joint state-private enterprises have developed considerably. Currently, nearly sixty large-scale steel, machinery, chemical, electric power, textile, cigarette, and pharmaceutical factories are being operated jointly by the state and private industrialists. The proportion of these new types of enterprises in Shanghai's total industrial output value is gradually increasing.

    In Shanghai, some of the joint state-private factories were formed after the People's Government confiscated the bureaucratic capital of enterprises or the property of traitors and counter-revolutionaries, turning them into joint state-private ventures. However, most were established in the past two or three years under the encouragement of the People's Government, with far-sighted private industrialists voluntarily joining forces with the state. After these enterprises were converted into joint state-private ventures, their production direction was determined, and their business operations have shown significant progress. Production has been incorporated into the national planning track, and they no longer engage in blind production or activities detrimental to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The Huadong Steel Construction Factory, which started its joint operation this year, was originally a Baofuji Cold-Working Factory riddled with all sorts of evils. This factory had caused the state a lot of losses in contracting projects such as the Huai River闸门 (sluice gate); After the joint state-private venture was established, the state sent cadres to participate in management and added many workers and equipment. Now, it has become a specialized steel construction team under the unified allocation of the state. This year, it has undertaken the task of constructing factory buildings for key construction units in China, such as the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant. The Sino-Western Pharmacy, which used to mainly engage in the sale of domestic and foreign patent medicines, destroyed more than one hundred kinds of deceptive and ineffective drugs after the joint venture was established, and built a new pharmaceutical factory, transforming from a mainly commercial enterprise to mainly engage in the manufacture of medicines. The Tianshan Chemical Factory, which used to mainly rely on imported plastics to manufacture consumer goods such as soap boxes before liberation, now specializes in the production of high-grade insulated Bakelite powder and Bakelite products, which are important raw materials for the electrical industry. The former private Huatong Electric Motor Factory and Xinzhong Engineering Co., Ltd. have been converted into specialized manufacturers of electrical switches and power machines, respectively, after the joint venture.

    On the track of national planning, the procurement of raw materials and the sales of products are uniformly distributed and allocated by the state. Therefore, the production capacity and the enterprises themselves have expanded several times or even dozens of times compared to before the joint venture. The three factories under the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company have increased their workers by seven times, and this year's steel output will reach thirty-one times the highest annual output before liberation. The output of six main products of Tianyuan and Tianli Chemical Plants, such as liquid alkali, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and bleaching powder, in 1952 increased to more than three times or nine times respectively compared to 1949. The output of insulated Bakelite powder from Tianshan Chemical Plant this year will reach fifty-eight times that of 1949. The Zhabei Hydroelectric Power Company, which was recently converted into a joint state-private venture, has decided to add a large generator, which will greatly increase the power supply in the northern district of Shanghai.

    After the joint state-private ventures were established, democratic reforms were carried out, and the management institutions and production management systems were also initially reformed, which greatly increased the enthusiasm of the employees for production. These are important factors for the rapid growth of production in joint state-private enterprises. Under the leadership of relevant state departments and the guidance of Soviet experts, the employees of Tianyuan and Tianli Chemical Plants broke with conservative ideas and brought their production potential into full play. The unit output of the plant's main products has increased year by year, and in April of this year, it increased to more than two or three times compared to before liberation. The production spindle pull of Xinyi Cotton Mill in the first quarter of this year has reached 0.96 pounds to 1 pound (originally approved at 0.94 pounds), and the quality of the yarn has also reached Grade A.

    With the development of production and the gradual improvement of business management, the financial situation of these joint state-private enterprises has completely changed. Many enterprises that suffered huge losses before the joint venture now have large surpluses.

    Due to the greater surpluses of the enterprises, the enterprises' public accumulation fund, safety and health equipment, employee benefits, and shareholders' dividends and bonuses are guaranteed. Several enterprises have allocated a portion of the public accumulation fund to engage in factory expansion and the purchase of production equipment. Safety and health equipment and workers' welfare have also been improved.

    上海市公私合营企业稳步发展
    生产纳入国家计划轨道生产能力迅速增长
    三年来，上海市公私合营的企业有了相当的发展，目前已经有将近六十家规模较大的钢铁、机械、化工、电力和纺织、卷烟、制药工厂，是由国家与私营工业家合作经营的。这些新型的企业，在上海市工业生产总值中所占的比重，正在逐步增长中。
    上海市的公私合营工厂除了一部分是人民政府没收了企业中的官僚资本或汉奸、反革命分子的财产变为公私合营者外，大部分是最近两三年中在人民政府的鼓励下，有远见的私营工业家自愿与国家合营的。这些企业改由公私合营后，确定了生产的方向，经营情况都有显著的进步，生产已纳入国家计划的轨道，不再盲目的生产或从事不利于国计民生的活动。今年开始合营的华东钢铁建筑厂，原是一家“五毒”俱全的包福记冷作厂，这个厂过去在承包淮河闸门等工程中曾使国家遭受很多损失；公私合营后，国家派干部参加管理，增添了很多工人和设备，现已成为国家统一调配的一支专业的钢铁建筑队伍，今年已担负了第一汽车制造厂和太原重型机器厂等我国重点建设单位的厂房构造任务。过去主要从事国内外成药买卖的中西大药房，合营后销毁了一百多种欺骗性的无效药品，并新建了制药工厂，由主要从事商业性的企业转变为主要从事药品的制造。解放以前依赖进口塑胶制造肥皂盒等消费品为主的天山化工厂，合营后专制电器工业的重要原料——高级绝缘电木粉和电木成品。原私营华通电机厂和新中工程股份有限公司，合营后已分别改为专业的电器开关和动力机的制造厂。
    在国家计划的轨道上，原料的采购和产品的销售都由国家统一分配和调拨，因而这些厂的生产能力和企业的本身，都比合营以前有几倍甚至几十倍的扩展。上海钢铁公司所属三个厂，工人增加了七倍，今年钢的产量将达到解放前最高年产量的三十一倍。天原、天利电化厂液碱、盐酸、硝酸、漂白粉等六种主要产品，一九五二年的产量比一九四九年分别增加到三倍或九倍以上。天山化工厂今年绝缘电木粉的产量将达一九四九年时的五十八倍。不久前改由公私合营的闸北水电公司，已决定增加一部大的发电机，这将使上海北区的供电量大大增加。
    公私合营后的企业，都已进行了民主改革，管理机构和生产管理制度也作了初步的改革，职工生产积极性因此大大提高。这些都是公私合营企业生产迅速增长的一个重要因素。天原、天利电化厂职工们在国家有关部门的领导和苏联专家的指导下，打破了保守思想，发挥了生产潜力。该厂主要产品的单位产量逐年提高，今年四月比解放以前，提高到两倍或三倍以上。信和纱厂今年第一季度的生产锭扯已达到零点九六磅到一磅（原核定为零点九四磅），纱的品级也达到了甲级。
    随着生产的发展和经营管理的逐步改善，这些公私合营企业的财务情况完全改观了。许多合营前亏损巨大的企业，目前都有了较大的盈余。
    由于企业有了较多的盈余，企业的公积金、安全卫生设备、职工福利和股东的股息、红利都有了保证。若干企业已拨出一部分公积金从事工厂的扩建和添置生产设备。安全卫生设备和工人的福利也有了改善。    （新华社）
