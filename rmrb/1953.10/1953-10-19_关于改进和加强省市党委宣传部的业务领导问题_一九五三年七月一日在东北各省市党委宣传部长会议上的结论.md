    On Improving and Strengthening the Business Leadership of Provincial and Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Departments
    —Conclusion at the Northeast Provincial and Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Ministers Conference on July 1, 1953
    Lǐ Zhuōrán
    Editor's Note: Currently, Party Committee Propaganda Departments in various regions are studying how to strengthen mass propaganda work during the period of national construction. Our newspaper is publishing two articles by Comrade Li Zhuoran, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Comrade Shu Tong, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, for reference. Comrades!
    The convocation of our conference is timely. Although the discussion involved many issues, they all tended toward a central issue: how to improve and strengthen the business leadership of the Party Committee Propaganda Department to meet the needs of the new period of national construction. Through group and plenary discussions, everyone put forward many important situations and methods for improving future work. At the same time, with the help of comrades from the Central Propaganda Department and the East China Bureau Propaganda Department, we studied some important issues, and the conference has basically completed its task.
    Due to time constraints, the discussion of some issues was not deep or specific enough; some issues involve important questions such as the leadership methods and organizational forms of the Party in the new period of national construction, which cannot be completely resolved by our conference. However, the comrades' opinions can be provided to the Northeast Bureau for consideration and necessary regulations.
    Now, I will make a comprehensive supplementary explanation on the following two issues.
    First, what are the main tasks (or main work) of the provincial and municipal Party Committee Propaganda Departments at present?
    I believe that its main tasks include the following:
    (1) In conjunction with the central tasks of economic construction in each period, do a good job in the Party's propaganda and mobilization work. To this end:
    1. The ministers and relevant responsible cadres of the provincial and municipal Party Committee Propaganda Departments should always pay attention to the central tasks of each period, study the Party's instructions, and participate in the Party Committee's discussions and arrangements for each period's central work.
    2. When the provincial and municipal Party Committee's Industrial Department, Basic Construction Department, Commercial Department, Rural Work Department, and other departments are arranging the central work of each period according to the instructions of the provincial and municipal Party Committees, they should simultaneously propose and arrange the propaganda work tasks to complete this central work in coordination with the Party Committee Propaganda Department. The Party Committee Propaganda Department should establish close contact and cooperation with the aforementioned financial departments of the same level Party Committee in order to discuss such propaganda work plans in a timely manner. To this end, the existing organizational structure of the Propaganda Section of the provincial and municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department should be appropriately expanded in order to establish close contact with the aforementioned financial departments and understand the work situation in a timely manner.
    3. After formulating a propaganda work plan to ensure the completion of the central task of current production or basic construction, the aforementioned Party competent departments and the Party Committee Propaganda Department should jointly conduct inspections, promptly understand the ideological situation of workers, peasants, and engineering and technical personnel in the movement, grasp the advanced experiences and advanced figures in the movement for effective propaganda, and continuously overcome various conservative and backward ideological viewpoints to ensure the successful completion of the central task.
    4. In completing the task of national economic construction, the propaganda work of the Party's grassroots organizations is particularly important. The Party Committee Propaganda Department must always pay attention to improving the education work of branches in production units (including the education of grassroots cadres in factories, mines, and rural areas), and strengthen the political and ideological education of workers and engineering and technical personnel. The plan for branch education and worker political education should be studied and formulated into a unified plan, which will be directly led by the Party organization, but this should not weaken the responsibility of the trade union to conduct political education for the working masses.
    Cultural, technical, and professional education for cadres and employees in factories and mines can be organized and carried out separately by trade unions and administrative organs of factories and mines.
    (2) Theoretical education and current affairs policy education for cadres in service.
    The Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau have clear instructions on cadre theory education. The provincial and municipal Party Committee Propaganda Departments should actively assume the responsibility of organization and leadership, and focus on the following two aspects:
    1. Do a good job in the theoretical study of cadres in service, especially the theoretical study of senior core groups. This can relatively smoothly solve the problem of study guidance and the problem of combining theory with practice in learning.
    2. According to the recent instructions issued by the Northeast Bureau, do a good job in spare-time political schools; and pay attention to improving current affairs policy education among cadres in service.
    (3) Strengthen the leadership of cultural and educational work (including national education, mass culture, literary and artistic creation, health work, elimination of illiteracy, sports, etc.).
    Implement the Party's actual leadership over cultural and educational work through the Party organizations in the government's cultural and educational committees and the Communist Party members and cadres in the cultural and educational work organs. The Communist Party members in the cultural and educational work departments should unite all cultural and educational workers well, conscientiously study the Party and state policies and laws, develop a pragmatic work style, and implement the Central Committee's policies, guidelines, and plans for cultural and educational work.
    (4) Cultivate and manage propaganda and cultural work cadres
    Cultivation methods: do a good job in the study of cadres in service; set up necessary deputy positions; the Party school should plan to transfer propaganda cadres for training; and hold various short-term training courses as needed and possible.
    Sources of cadres: Coordinate with relevant departments to appropriately transfer, train, or gradually promote from workers, grassroots cadres, and young intellectuals to work positions in a planned manner.
    At present, the main task of the cadre management department of the provincial and municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department is to coordinate with relevant work units to understand and familiarize themselves with the cadres under their management through inspection work. Establish the necessary system for managing cultural and educational work cadres.
    (5) Strengthen specific leadership over newspaper work and other propaganda weapons.
    Implement the Central Committee's decision to launch criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals. Strengthen the ideological leadership of newspaper cadres, improve the quality of interviews, and check the improvement after the Northeast Region Newspaper Work Conference in February this year. In addition, propaganda organizations and propaganda weapons such as propaganda networks, education networks, lecturers' groups, cultural work groups, and cultural centers should be regularly inspected, summarized their experiences, and continuously improve their work quality.
    Second, the issue of improving leadership style and working methods.
    In recent years, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the Party's propaganda work in various parts of the Northeast has been successful. After the struggle against bureaucracy, the leadership style has also been significantly improved, and some good work experience has been accumulated. However, it must be admitted that our progress is far from meeting the needs of the development of the objective situation, and our leadership style and leadership methods still have many shortcomings. Among them, the more common and serious problems are formalism (which is a bad result of bureaucratic leadership). The main characteristic of this formalism is not that there are too many forms of propaganda work, but that the work is generalized and lacks specific guidance and practical inspection. Some organizations are merely in form and have little or no practical content. Secondly, in the work, we cannot grasp or tighten the center. Some do not distinguish between priorities and are passively coping with situations, and the quality of work is very poor. The root cause of these problems is the subjective ideological method and the lack of scientific and systematic working methods. In addition, some manifestations of decentralism or blind activism have been criticized in the comrades' speeches, and they should be earnestly inspected and corrected.
    In order to improve and strengthen the Party's propaganda work, it is necessary to:
    (1) Continue to deepen the struggle against bureaucracy, systematically and practically inspect our various tasks, listen to the demands and opinions of the masses, understand the suffering of the masses, and check the actual effect of our work and its reflection among the masses. Bring the serious events that occur below to our leadership responsibilities for inspection and improvement.
    (2) Seize typical examples, establish models, carry out positive propaganda and promotion, and criticize various conservative, backward, and other erroneous views and practices. When summarizing advanced typical experiences, there should be specific analysis, and the central link of the problem and the basic key to solving the problem should be grasped. Do not list a large number of phenomena so that learners cannot get the gist.
    In short, in our work, we must always abide by Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, so that the leadership of our Communists is closely combined with the demands of the broad masses, and our general appeals are closely combined with individual guidance, and thoroughly shatter the subjective and bureaucratic leadership methods.
    (3) Report the important situations or new problems learned in actual work to the Party Secretary and other responsible comrades and put forward opinions on how to carry out propaganda work in response to this situation. If the above two tasks are done well, plus this one, the Party's propaganda department can better obtain the close guidance of the Party committee and promote the entire Party to do propaganda work.
    (4) Propaganda work cadres, especially the comrades of the Party Committee Propaganda Department, must take the lead in studying the Party's theory and policies, learn to do ideological criticism work, and constantly improve their ideological level and professional ability, and strive to become experts in the Party's propaganda work, in order to strengthen the Party's ideological work in the new period of national construction and ensure the completion of the central tasks of the Party and the state; and strive for our motherland to gradually realize national industrialization and gradually transition to a socialist society.

    关于改进和加强省市党委宣传部的业务领导问题
    ——一九五三年七月一日在东北各省市党委宣传部长会议上的结论
    李卓然
    编者按：目前各地党委宣传部正研究如何加强国家建设时期的群众宣传工作，本报特于今明两日刊载中共中央东北局宣传部部长李卓然同志和中共中央华东局宣传部部长舒同同志关于
    这方面的两篇文章，供各地参考。同志们！
    我们这次会议的召开是适时的，讨论中牵涉到的问题虽然很多，但都趋向于一个中心问题，就是如何改进和加强党委宣传部的业务领导以适应国家新的建设时期的需要。经过小组和大会的讨论，大家提出了不少重要的情况和改进今后工作的办法，同时又有中央宣传部和华东局宣传部的同志帮助，我们研究了一些重要问题，会议已基本上完成了它的任务。
    因时间的限制，有些问题的讨论还不够深入、具体；有些问题牵涉到在新的国家建设时期党委的领导方法和组织形式等重要问题，虽不是我们这次会议所能完全解决的，但同志们的意见是可以提供东北局考虑后作出必要的规定的。
    我现在再就下面的两个问题综合补充说明一下。
    第一，目前省市党委宣传部的主要业务（或主要工作）是什么？
    我认为它的主要业务有下列各项：
    （一）结合各个时期经济建设的中心任务，作好党的宣传鼓动工作。为此：
    一、省市委宣传部部长及有关负责干部要经常注意各个时期的中心工作，研究党的指示，参加党委讨论与布置每个时期中心工作的会议。
    二、省市委工业部、基本建设部、商业部、农村工作部等部门，在根据省市委的指示布置每个时期的中心工作时，应协同党委宣传部同时提出并布置为完成这一中心工作的宣传工作任务。党委宣传部应与同级党委上述各财经部门取得密切的联系和配合，以便商订这种宣传工作计划。为此，省市委宣传部现有宣传处的编制应适当扩大，以便与上述各财经部门取得密切的联系及时了解工作情况。
    三、根据当前生产或基本建设的中心任务制订了保证完成这一中心任务的宣传工作计划后，上述党委主管部门和党委宣传部应协同进行检查，及时了解运动中工人、农民和工程技术人员的思想情况，抓住运动中的先进经验和先进人物进行有效的宣传，不断克服各种保守的和落后的思想观点，以保证中心任务的胜利完成。
    四、在完成国家经济建设任务中，党的基层组织的宣传工作特别重要，党委宣传部必须经常注意改进生产单位中的支部教育工作（包括对厂矿及农村基层干部的教育），加强在工人及工程技术人员中的政治思想教育。关于支部教育和工人政治教育的计划，应即研究并制定一个统一的方案，由党的组织直接领导进行，但不应因此减弱工会对工人群众进行政治教育的责任。
    工矿中干部和职工的文化、技术、业务教育可分别由工会、厂矿行政机关去组织进行。
    （二）在职干部的理论教育与时事政策教育。
    干部理论教育，中央、东北局已有明确指示。省市委宣传部应积极负起组织领导的责任，并抓住以下两个环节：
    一、搞好在职干部的理论学习，特别是要搞好高级核心组的理论学习。这样就可以比较顺利的解决学习指导力量问题和在学习中理论联系实际的问题。
    二、根据东北局最近发布的指示，搞好业余政治学校；并注意改进在职干部中的时事政策教育。
    （三）加强对文教工作（包括国民教育、群众文化、文艺创作、卫生工作、扫除文盲、体育等等）的领导。
    通过政府文化教育委员会中的党组织及文教工作机关的党员干部来实行党对文教工作的实际领导，文教工作部门的共产党员应很好的团结全体文教工作人员，认真学习党和国家的政策、法令，养成实事求是的工作作风，贯彻执行中央关于文教工作的政策、方针和计划。
    （四）培养与管理宣传文教工作干部
    培养方法：搞好在职干部学习；设置必要的工作副职；在党校应有计划抽调宣传干部加以训练；根据需要与可能条件，举办各种短期训练班等。
    干部来源：协同有关部门有计划地从工人中、基层干部中及青年知识分子中适当抽调、训练或逐级提拔到工作岗位上来。
    目前省市委宣传部干部管理处的主要任务是协同各有关工作单位，从检查工作中去了解与熟悉所管干部。建立管理文教工作干部的必要制度。
    （五）加强对报纸工作及其他宣传武器的具体领导。
    贯彻执行中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定。加强对报社干部的思想领导，提高采访质量，检查今年二月东北区报纸工作会议后的改进情况。此外，宣传网、教育网、讲师团、文工团、文化馆站等宣传组织与宣传武器，均应分别进行定期的检查，总结经验，不断提高其工作质量。
    第二，改进领导作风与工作方法问题。
    近年来，东北各地党的宣传工作在各级党委的领导下都是有成绩的，经过反官僚主义的斗争，领导作风亦有显著的改进，并已积累了一些好的工作经验。但应该承认我们的进步还远赶不上客观形势发展的需要，我们的领导作风和领导方法仍然存在着许多缺点，其中较为普遍、较为严重的毛病，就是形式主义（这是官僚主义领导所产生的一种恶果），这种形式主义的主要特点还不在于宣传工作的形式过多，而是在于工作的一般化，缺乏具体的指导和切实的检查，有些组织徒具形式，没有或很少有实际内容。其次，就是在工作中抓不住或抓不紧中心，有的不分轻重缓急，被动应付，工作质量很差。产生这些毛病的根源，就是主观主义的思想方法与缺乏科学条理性的工作方法。此外，如分散主义或盲目积极性的某些表现，在同志们的发言中已经批判到了，均应切实检查纠正。
    为了改进和加强党的宣传工作必须：
    （一）继续深入反官僚主义斗争，有系统地、切实地检查我们的各种工作，倾听群众的要求和意见，了解群众中的疾苦，检查我们工作的实际效果和在群众中的反映。把在下边发生的严重事件提到我们的领导责任上来加以检查和改进。
    （二）抓住典型、树立样子，进行正面的宣传推广，批判各种保守的、落后的及其他错误的观点和作法。在总结先进的典型经验时，要有具体分析，要抓住问题的中心环节和解决问题的基本关键，不要罗列一大堆现象，使学的人得不到要领。
    总之，我们在工作中要经常遵守着毛泽东同志的指示，使我们共产党人的领导和广大群众的要求密切地相结合，使我们的一般号召和个别指导密切地相结合，而彻底粉碎主观主义的和官僚主义的领导方法。
    （三）把在实际工作中所了解的重要情况或新的问题经常向党委书记及其他负责同志报告并提出针对着这种情况如何进行宣传工作的意见，做好了以上两项工作，再加上这一条，党的宣传部门就可以更好的取得党委的密切指导，推动全党作宣传工作。
    （四）宣传工作干部，首先是党委宣传部的同志均要以身作则的努力学习党的理论和政策，学会作思想批判工作，不断提高自己的思想水平和业务能力，努力使自己成为党的宣传工作的内行，为加强党在国家建设新时期的思想工作，保证完成党和国家的中心任务而奋斗；为我们祖国逐步实现国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗。
