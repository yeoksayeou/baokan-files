    National railway transportation actively supports basic construction. With the start of the country's first five-year construction plan, the railway is undertaking greater transportation tasks. From January to September this year, the volume of freight transport increased by 22.8 percent compared with the same period last year. April, which used to be called a "slow month," was no longer "slow" in terms of freight, and the transport volume surged instead. The proportion of various transported materials has changed significantly: the transport volume of mineral building materials in the first half of this year exceeded twelve times the total for the entire year of 1950, already surpassing many types of goods and jumping to second place; the amount of steel transported in the first half of this year was 66.2 percent more than the entire year of 1950; the transport volume of cement in the first eight months of this year increased by 39.9 percent compared with the same period last year; the continuous inflow of Northeast timber, the large northward movement of Hunan fir poles, and the Shanghai machinery transported to the inland areas have all increased significantly compared to previous years. The volume of materials passing through the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, which is undergoing large-scale construction, is more than double that of 1950. The materials supplied by various places for the construction of the capital have resulted in a 61 percent increase in the unloading volume at the sixteen stations around Beijing compared to last year. Due to the large-scale mobilization of labor and the improvement of people's lives, the number of passengers traveling by train in the first half of this year was also 40.3 percent more than in the same period last year.
    In order to support basic construction in various places, appropriate consideration is given to the materials needed for basic construction in terms of freight rates and priority transportation. At present, railway freight rates are divided into 30 classes according to the nature of the goods. Stone freight is classified as 27th class, bricks and tiles as 26th class, and steel and wood as 24th class. A large number of imported machinery, oil and other industrial construction equipment and materials can generally be transported to the inland areas first after arriving at the border stations and port stations. The Ministry of Railways has special freight dispatch personnel to manage the transportation of Anshan Iron and Steel, so that the materials from all over the country supporting Anshan Iron and Steel can be loaded in a balanced manner according to the production situation and unloading capacity of Anshan Iron and Steel. In August, floods occurred west and north of Shenyang, and the railway line directly connecting to Anshan Iron and Steel from inside Shanhaiguan was interrupted. In order not to affect the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, the railway rerouted a large number of materials supporting Anshan Iron and Steel from inside Shanhaiguan to Jilin. From January to September this year, the important materials needed for basic construction, such as steel, steel products, cement, and mineral building materials, all exceeded the monthly planned targets. On the railway transport lines, a large number of new line construction materials are transported to various construction sites every day. For example, the steel rails, sleepers, and cement currently transported to Tiancheng Road account for a quarter of the transport volume of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway.

    全国铁路运输积极支援基本建设
    全国铁路运输积极支援基本建设。随着国家第一个五年建设计划的开始，铁路担负着更大的运输任务。今年一月到九月，货物运输量比去年同一时期增加了百分之二十二点八，一向被称为“淡月”的四月，货运不再“清淡”，运输量反而激增。各项运输物资的比重，有了显著的改变：矿物性建筑材料今年上半年的运输量超过一九五○年全年的十二倍，已经超过多种货物，跃居为第二位；今年上半年所运的钢铁，比一九五○年全年多了百分之六十六点二；今年前八个月水泥的运输量，比去年同一时期增加了百分之三十九点九；源源进关的东北木材，大量北上的湖南杉杆，运往内地的上海的机器，都比往年显著增加。大规模建设中的鞍山钢铁公司，经由铁路吞吐的物资，比一九五○年多了一倍以上。各地供应首都建设的物资，使北京环城十六个车站卸车量比去年增加百分之六十一。由于大量劳动力的调动和人民生活的改善，今年上半年坐火车的旅客，也比去年同一时期多了百分之四十点三。
    为了支援各地基本建设，对于基本建设所需要的物资，在运价方面和优先运输方面，都有适当的照顾。目前铁路的货物运价，按照货物性质规定，分为三十等。石料运价列为二十七等，砖瓦二十六等，钢铁、木材二十四等。大量进口的机器、油类等工业建设器材和物资，到国境站、口岸站后，一般都可首先被运送到内地。铁道部设有专门的货运调度人员掌握鞍钢的运输，使全国各地支援鞍钢的物资，能够根据鞍钢的生产情况和卸车能力做到平衡装车。八月间，沈阳以西、以北发生水灾，从关内直接通往鞍钢的铁路线间断，为了不使鞍钢建设受到影响，铁路把关内大量支援鞍钢的物资，绕道吉林运去。今年一月到九月，基本建设所需要的重要物资钢铁、钢铁制品、水泥、矿物性建筑材料，按月间计划都超额完成了计划。在铁路运输线上，每天有大批的新线建筑器材，被运送到各施工地点，如目前运往天成路的钢轨、枕木和水泥，就占成渝路运输量的四分之一。
