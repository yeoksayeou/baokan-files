    The Central Ministry of Commerce Issues Instructions on Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
    Calling on National State-Owned Commercial Departments to Overfulfill Purchasing and Marketing Plans
    [By this newspaper] The Central People's Government Ministry of Commerce recently issued instructions, calling on national state-owned commercial departments to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy, striving to overfulfill purchasing and marketing plans.
    In early September, after inspecting the execution of the third quarter plan and studying the work for the fourth quarter, and in conjunction with estimates of market development after the autumn harvest, the Central Ministry of Commerce determined that the central task for the fourth quarter would be to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy, complete and overfulfill purchasing and marketing plans, combat speculation, stabilize the market, and especially closely coordinate with the purchase of agricultural products to strive to overfulfill total sales.
    The Central Ministry of Commerce's instructions first pointed out that since July and August, under the leadership and support of the central and local Party and government organizations, state-owned commerce has reversed the situation of insufficient market estimates and inappropriate measures in the first half of the year. In the past two months, significant achievements have been made in expanding processing orders and actively organizing sources of goods in various regions. Commodity inventories have generally increased, and out-of-stock situations have improved. Procurement is continuing according to plan, and the supply of the vast majority of commodities needed by the people during the peak season after the autumn harvest can be guaranteed. For the few commodities that still have problems, basic solutions or improvements may be achieved due to increased production by industrial departments.
    The instructions pointed out that state-owned commerce must take the campaign to increase production and practice economy, complete and overfulfill purchasing and marketing plans, combat speculation, stabilize the market, and especially closely coordinate with the purchase of agricultural products to strive to overfulfill sales targets as the central task of its work after the autumn harvest. Moreover, only by selling more can state-owned commerce further lead the market, stabilize prices, promote industrial production, and increase state tax revenue. Only by completing the purchasing plan for agricultural products can the supply of raw materials for industrial production and the needs of cities and exports be effectively ensured. Only by expanding sales can capital turnover be accelerated and the regular operation and development of profit submission and processing order work be guaranteed. At the same time, active sales promotion can improve the operation and management of state-owned commercial departments and raise the awareness of employees.
    The instructions emphasized that the tasks of state-owned commerce in the fourth quarter are arduous and heavy, but they can be completed. To this end, the following work must be done: (1) Mobilize all employees to launch campaigns, especially sales promotion campaigns. All employees must understand that overfulfilling the purchasing and marketing plan is the central task of increasing production and practicing economy in state-owned commerce, as well as the important significance of coordinating with the purchase of agricultural products to stabilize the market. Employees must clearly understand the market and sources of goods, prevent any possible conservative reluctance to sell and deviations from policy implementation. Based on past experience, it is advisable for state-owned commercial departments to launch competitions among enterprises in the same region and within a single enterprise. In regions with a better work foundation, in addition to launching competitions to complete purchasing and marketing plans, competitions on financial indicators should also be launched. In the competition, there should be not only quantitative indicators but also qualitative indicators. Attention should be paid to timely rewards. In addition to rewarding individuals with inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals, attention should generally be paid to rewarding collectives more. (2) Improve the distribution, transportation, and adjustment of commodities, strengthen the connection between enterprises from top to bottom and internally and externally, and overcome the phenomenon of stockpiling in one place and out-of-stock in another in commodity distribution. The integrity of state-owned commerce must be emphasized, mutual support and communication of information should be promoted, and a correspondent system should be established to exchange information on prices, markets, and illegal private merchant reselling at any time. General companies and provincial and municipal companies must strengthen their grasp of commodity purchase, sale, and inventory situations. Internal connections within enterprises must be strengthened and closely integrated so that state-owned commerce can truly form a unified leadership, strong and consolidated combat force. (3) Closely combine with cooperatives. It must be recognized that helping cooperatives develop is a basic task of state-owned commerce already stipulated in the Common Program. The preferential rates and priority purchasing rights for cooperatives must be conscientiously implemented. Certain commodities, certain quantities, can be sold to cooperatives on credit (generally not exceeding ten days). In business operations, active assistance should be given. (4) Continue to organize sources of goods, especially sources of insufficient commodities. Improve transportation, advance procurement, and try to ensure that domestic and foreign commodities meet the needs of the people in terms of quality, quantity, and time, and pay attention to studying the organization of production for the first quarter of next year, and strengthen the operation of industrial equipment. (5) Strengthen the supply of non-staple foods to large cities and industrial and mining areas. Native product companies must also pay attention to purchasing native and sideline products in disaster areas to help disaster victims produce for self-relief. (6) Prepare for the various planning tasks for 1954. First of all, the situation of production and consumption must be deeply studied, and attention should be paid to accepting the lessons of this year's insufficient market estimates, laying the foundation for next year's planning work. (7) Political education and ideological leadership for employees must be strengthened. A strong inspection team should be organized, focusing on inspecting the execution of commodity circulation plans and financial plans, solving problems in a timely and appropriate manner, and exchanging experiences to improve and promote work.

    中央商业部发出增产节约的指示
    号召全国国营商业部门超额完成购销计划
    【本报讯】中央人民政府商业部日前发出指示，号召全国国营商业部门开展增产节约竞赛，争取超额完成购销计划。
    中央商业部九月初旬在检查第三季度计划执行情况和研究第四季度工作以后，结合对秋后市场发展的估计，确定以开展增产节约竞赛，完成与超额完成购销计划，打击投机，稳定市场，特别是密切配合农产品收购，争取超额完成销售总额为第四季度的中心任务。
    中央商业部的指示首先指出：自七、八月份以来，在中央与各地党政的领导与支持下，国营商业已扭转上半年对市场估计不足、措施失当的情况；两个月来，各地在扩大加工订货、积极组织货源方面已有显著成绩。商品库存普遍增加，脱销情况已有改善，现在并在继续按计划进货，对秋后旺季人民需要的绝大多数商品，可以保证供应；对尚有问题的少数商品，由于工业部门的增产，也可能获得基本解决或改善。
    指示指出：国营商业必须以开展增产节约竞赛，完成与超额完成购销计划，打击投机、稳定市场，特别是密切配合农产品收购，争取超额完成销售任务为秋后工作的中心任务。而且，也只有多卖，国营商业才能够进一步领导市场，稳定物价，促进工业生产，增加国家税收；只有完成农产品的收购计划，才能有效地供应工业生产原料及城市与出口的需要；只有扩大销售，才能加速资金周转，保证上缴利润与加工订货工作的经常进行与发展；同时积极推销，才能改善国营商业部门的经营管理，提高职工的觉悟程度。
    指示着重指出：国营商业第四季度的任务是艰巨和繁重的，但是可以完成的。为此，必须做好以
  下工作：（一）动员全体职工，开展竞赛，尤其是开展推销竞赛。要使全体职工了解超额完成购销计划是国营商业增产节约的中心任务，以及配合农产品收购，稳定市场的重要意义。要使职工认清市场与货源情况，防止任何可能发生的保守惜售思想与不执行政策的偏向。根据以往经验，国营商业部门开展竞赛以在同一地区的企业之间与一个企业的内部为宜。在工作基础较好的地区，除开展完成购销计划的竞赛外，还应开展财务指标的竞赛。在竞赛中，不仅要有数量指标，而且要有质量指标。要注意及时进行奖励，除应奖励有发明创造与合理化建议的个人外，一般要注意多奖励集体。（二）改善商品的分配、运输与调剂工作，加强企业上下、内外的联系，克服商品分配中此地积压、彼地脱销的现象。要强调国营商业的整体性，提倡互相支援沟通情况，建立通讯员制度，随时交换物价、市场以及不法私商倒运等情况。总公司与省、市公司要加强对商品购、销、存情况的掌握，企业内部要加强联系，密切结合，使国营商业真正结成一支统一领导，坚强巩固的战斗力量。（三）密切与合作社的结合。必须认识：帮助合作社发展，是共同纲领已经规定的国营商业的基本任务。必须切实贯彻对合作社的优待率与购货优先权，一定的商品、一定的数量，对合作社可以赊销（一般不超过十天）。在业务经营上，应大力予以协助。（四）继续组织货源，特别是组织不足的商品货源。改进运输、提前进货，尽量使国内外商品在品质与数量时间上适合人民需要，并注意研究明年第一季度生产的组织，加强对工业器材的经营。（五）加强对大城市及工矿区的副食品供应工作，土产公司并须注意在灾区收购土、副产品，帮助灾民生产自救。（六）要做好一九五四年的各项计划工作。首先必须深入地研究生产与消费情况，并注意接受今年对市场估计不足的教训，为明年计划工作打下基础。（七）必须加强对职工的政治教育与思想领导，组织强有力的检查组，以检查商品流转计划与财务计划的执行情况为中心，及时、恰当地解决问题，并交流经验，以改进和推动工作。
