Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 19th: The Third World Federation of Trade Unions Congress continued its discussion of Vittorio's report at its meeting on the 17th.

	The representative of the working people of the Netherlands, Wessel Hartogh, was the first to speak. He said: The Dutch delegation agrees with Vittorio's proposal to formulate a charter on the trade union rights of the working people of all countries.

	The Indian representative, Dange, congratulated the congress on behalf of the All-India Trade Union Congress. He expressed his agreement with the reports of Saillant and Vittorio, and pointed out that the situation analyzed in these two reports is very important to the Indian trade union movement. Dange pointed out that in India, many workers belonging to different trade unions have taken concerted action in their struggles. Facts have proved that the splitters of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" cannot undermine the unity of action of Indian workers. The unity of action of Indian workers has enabled the Indian trade unions to achieve some success in the movement for organizational unity. For example, unified organizations have been established in the cement industry, aviation industry, oil refining industry, banking industry, and other industrial sectors.

	Jack Litton, a British representative attending the congress, spoke and read out a speech by another British attending representative, Mahoney. In his speech, Mahoney said: The British delegation attending the congress was elected and sent by the employees of our factory. He said that war preparations and the continued presence of American occupation forces in Britain are a heavy burden on the British working people, and their living standards and social rights are constantly under attack. The British working class cannot tolerate this situation. A broad movement demanding higher wages is unfolding across the country. This movement has united more than six million workers, and more British workers have realized the great importance of trade with the East for the British economy.

	Mahoney then described the growing movement of British workers to strive for united action. He said: Under the current circumstances, British workers need international trade union solidarity more than workers in any other country.

	Lecoeur, the representative of the French General Confederation of Labor, said that the French workers' delegation fully agrees with the reports of Saillant and Vittorio. He pointed out that while safeguarding their own interests, the working people must oppose war and war propaganda, and defend peace. He said that the French working people are fighting for the development of a peaceful economy, against the Vietnam War, against France becoming a vassal state of the United States, and demanding that the people of Vietnam, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and other colonies be granted freedom.

	Representatives from Colombia, Italy, Switzerland, and Canada also spoke at the meeting.

	The meeting passed a declaration on the Tunisian issue, protesting against the French government's policy of using force to suppress the people in Tunisia.

    荷兰劳动人民的代表维塞尔·哈托赫第一个发言。他说：荷兰代表团同意维多里奥提出的制订一个关于各国劳动人民的工会权利的宪章的建议。
    印度代表丹吉代表全印总工会向大会致贺，他表示同意赛扬和维多里奥的报告，并指出：这二个报告所分析的情况对印度的工会运动非常重要。丹吉指出，在印度，已有许多属于不同工会的工人在斗争中采取了一致行动。事实证明，“国际自由工会联合会”的分裂分子是无法破坏印度工人的行动一致的。印度工人的行动一致，已使印度工会在组织上争取统一的运动得到了一些成就。例如，在水泥工业中，在航空业、炼油业、银行业及其他产业部门中，都已成立了统一组织。
    列席大会的英国代表杰克·利顿发言，他宣读了另一个英国列席代表马霍尼的演说。马霍尼在演说中说：参加大会的英国代表团是我们工厂的职工选举并派遣来的。他说：战争准备和美国占领军继续留在英国，是英国劳动人民沉重的负担，劳动人民的生活水准和他们的社会权利遭受到不断的进攻。英国工人阶级不能忍受这个情况，一个广泛的要求较高工资的运动正在全国展开，这个运动已团结了六百万以上的工人，更多的英国工人已明白了与东方贸易对英国经济的巨大重要性。
    马霍尼接着叙述了英国工人争取统一行动的运动正在日益增长的情形。他说：在目前情况下，英国工人比其他任何国家的工人更需要国际的工会团结。
    法国总工会代表勒歇尔发言说：法国工人代表团完全赞成赛扬和维多里奥的报告。他指出：劳动人民在保卫切身利益的同时，必须反对战争和战争宣传，保卫和平。他说：法国劳动人民正在为和平经济的发展，反对越南战争，反对法国成为美国的附属国，要求允许给越南、阿尔及利亚、突尼斯、摩洛哥和其他殖民地人民以自由而斗争。
    在会议上发言的还有哥伦比亚、意大利、瑞士和加拿大的代表。
    会议通过了关于突尼斯问题的宣言，抗议法国政府在突尼斯采取武力镇压的政策。
