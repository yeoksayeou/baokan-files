We Must Attach Great Importance to Higher Normal Education

The recent National Higher Normal Education Conference summarized the work experience of the past four years, discussed some basic issues of current higher normal education, and based on the general line of the state during the transition period and the basic tasks of the first five-year plan, and according to the existing foundation of higher normal schools and the preliminary indicators of the development of secondary schools in the next five years, after comprehensive and realistic repeated consideration, finally determined the guidelines, tasks and implementation methods of higher normal education in the future, and formulated a work program for higher normal education in the next few years. This will have a significant impact on national construction and education construction in the future.

The future tasks of higher normal education are very heavy and arduous. In the past four years, higher normal education has undergone rapid recovery and has developed greatly. The number of students has more than doubled that of the highest year in old China (1946), supplying a part of the teachers needed for the development of secondary schools in recent years. At the same time, a series of reforms have been carried out, such as the ideological transformation of teachers, the adjustment of departments and schools, and school reforms (including teaching reforms), and considerable achievements have been made. However, due to the weak original foundation and the shortage of teachers, equipment, and school buildings in higher normal schools themselves, it is no longer compatible with the development of secondary schools in recent years. In the next five years, the number of teachers needed by secondary schools, according to the minimum estimate of the Central Ministry of Education, will also be about 100,000. This shows that the scale of today's higher normal schools is far from meeting the needs of secondary schools. This is a major contradiction in the current education work. This contradiction must be resolved.

Running and developing higher normal education well is the key to running and developing general education well. We must seize this link. If higher normal education is not appropriately developed in the future, and its education quality is not improved, it will not only directly affect the quality of secondary education and prevent secondary schools from developing, but also affect national construction work. Therefore, higher normal education must do its best to implement the policy of "vigorously developing existing higher normal education in a planned and prepared manner based on needs and possibilities, on the basis of consolidating and consolidating existing higher normal education" as stipulated by this conference.

According to the above policy, the first is to expand existing higher normal schools, and the second is to develop new schools according to needs and possibilities. In order to solve the problem of teachers in secondary schools, on the one hand, qualified teachers are trained according to the regular academic system, and on the other hand, various forms of temporary transitional measures are adopted, such as running short-term training classes and using early graduation methods, to appropriately meet the current urgent needs. At the same time, in the process of development, higher normal education should pay attention to improving quality, conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, closely integrate with China's actual situation, steadily carry out teaching reforms, and pay attention to uniting and improving existing teachers and vigorously training new teachers. The problems existing in higher normal schools today are very complex. There are many specific problems, such as the specific methods of higher normal schools in various places in terms of consolidation and consolidation, and teaching reform. In addition to the Central Ministry of Education grasping the time to study and formulate according to the decisions of this conference, and assisting in the work below, the party committees at all levels should attach great importance to the higher normal schools in their localities and actually lead them.

In the past few years, although party committees and governments at all levels have made great efforts in the recovery and development of higher normal schools, it must be admitted that we have not given them the attention they deserve. The social psychology of belittling normal education left over from old China has not been transformed as it should be. At present, the psychology among young people who are unwilling to study normal education and teachers who are unwilling to teach in normal schools still exists quite universally. This has become a major obstacle to the development of the current normal education undertaking. Although there are extremely complex reasons here, this is inseparable from the fact that we have not run the existing schools well, many problems existing in the existing schools have not been resolved in time, and we have not given enough care to them, especially lack of leadership. While we must wage a tenacious struggle against this harmful psychology of belittling normal education left over from old China, the most important thing is to gradually change the status of the existing normal schools at all levels and embody our attention to them in fact. This requires party committees at all levels to strengthen their leadership over higher normal schools and improve the leadership of education departments and schools themselves. Many experiences have proved that wherever the party committee of a place pays more attention to the school, and the school leaders know how to rely on the leadership of the party, the school will be run better, there will be fewer problems, and the emotions of teachers and students will be more stable.

In the future, in accordance with the principle of unified leadership and hierarchical management, the party committees in various places should, in accordance with the central government's policies, give strong leadership to higher normal schools from the political, ideological, and organizational aspects, and constantly improve the leadership of education administrative departments and schools themselves, help solve all major problems, and enable higher normal schools to receive the party's regular care, leadership, and strict supervision. The party committees in various places should include the work of local higher normal schools on their agenda, strengthen leadership and inspection. At present, the political and ideological leadership of various schools must be strengthened. The party committees at all levels must first take the lead in the political theory study of college teachers. Secondly, they must assist the education administrative departments in solving the urgent needs of the school's main leading cadres and the backbone teachers of political theory courses. They must lead and supervise the party organizations and political counseling offices in the school to correctly carry out political and ideological work. We must correct the abnormal relationships between the party and the masses, between teachers and students, and between new and old teachers, as well as the lack of a strong political atmosphere in the school. We must correct the decentralism of education administrative departments and school leaders who do not ask the party committee and superiors for instructions and reports on many major issues and make their own decisions. This is the most basic link in consolidating the existing school work.

Each major administrative region, each province and city, must further find out the situation of teachers in secondary schools in its subordinate areas, the situation and potential of existing higher normal schools, and must correctly estimate the number of teachers needed for the development of secondary schools in the next few years (not only general total figures, but also classified figures for teachers of various subjects and various specialties), both taking into account the necessary quantity and ensuring a certain quality. This requires calculating detailed accounts in a realistic manner, and then referring to the development indicators proposed by the Central Ministry of Education, to make its own development plan. Otherwise, the five-year plan cannot be put forward, and the plan for 1954 will be incorrect. If this work is not done well, the education work will be in a passive state of no plan for a long time.

The National Higher Normal Education Conference has drawn conclusions on many fundamental issues. Higher normal schools in various places should implement the principles determined by this conference, implement its policies, and fulfill the tasks assigned to them. On the one hand, each school should give full play to its potential, actively create conditions, formulate its own development plan, and implement it conscientiously; on the other hand, it should conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, closely integrate with China's actual situation, move forward steadily, and seize the teaching reform, overcome the impatient mood of being too high and too hasty in the teaching reform, and at the same time correct or prevent the conservative thinking of being content with the status quo and delaying change. Recently, we must grasp the central link of teaching reform, solve the problems of teaching plans, teaching outlines, and lecture notes, and at the same time solve the problems of teaching organization and teaching methods accordingly. We must organize teachers through teaching research groups or teaching groups, give play to the spirit of collectivism, unite and cooperate, and work together to improve teachers' research atmosphere on political theory and education science, and solve teaching problems. Each school should improve its work on the basis of summarizing the experience of past teaching reforms, formulate a plan that is in line with the actual situation of the school, and move forward steadily. The school should strengthen the leadership of teaching work, strengthen the unity of teachers, correct the abnormal phenomena between new and old teachers, between teachers and students, and give full play to the enthusiasm and mutual assistance spirit of teachers, so that teaching reform and all other work of the school will gradually advance.

The Party and the People's Government are very concerned about the national normal education, attach importance to the work of normal schools at all levels, and care about the lives of the people's teachers. The important position of normal education and people's teachers in our national construction is affirmed. The history of the Soviet Union has pointed out the prospect for us. Those who are people's teachers should recognize their glorious position in the cause of national construction. To make the society respect normal education and to cultivate students' professional thinking of being a people's teacher, first of all, it is required that the teachers of higher normal schools and normal schools set an example for students, and first of all establish a firm will and determination to fight to the end for the people's education cause. There is no doubt that our country's normal education will achieve a lofty position and be respected by all the people.

    必须十分重视高等师范教育
    最近举行的全国高等师范教育会议，总结了四年以来的工作经验，讨论了当前高等师范教育的一些基本问题，并根据过渡时期国家总路线和第一个五年计划的基本任务，依据高等师范学校现有的基础和五年内中等学校发展初步拟出的指标，经过全面地、实事求是地反复考虑，最后确定了今后高等师范教育的方针、任务及实施办法，为今后几年高等师范教育拟制了一个工作纲领。这对今后国家建设和教育建设，将会发生重大的影响。
    高等师范教育今后的任务是非常沉重和艰巨的。四年来，高等师范教育经过迅速恢复，有了很大的发展，学生数目已比旧中国历史上最高的一年
    （一九四六年）增加一倍以上，供应了几年来中等学校发展所需要的一部分教师，同时进行了教师思想改造，院系调整、学校改革（包括教学改革）等一系列的改革工作，取得了相当大的成绩。但由于原有基础薄弱，高等师范学校本身师资不足，设备、校舍不足，已和近年中等学校的发展不相适应。今后五年中等学校需要的师资，按中央教育部最低的估计，也需十万人左右。这说明今天高等师范学校的规模是远不足以适应中等学校的需要。这是当前教育工作中的一个极大的矛盾。这个矛盾必须解决。
    办好和发展高等师范教育，是办好和发展普通教育的关键。我们必须抓紧这一环节。如果今后高等师范教育不作适当发展，它的教育质量不提高，不仅会直接影响中等教育的质量，使中等学校不能发展，而且会影响国家建设工作。因此高等师范教育必须尽力贯彻这次会议所规定的“在整顿巩固现有高等师范教育的基础上，根据需要与可能，有计划、有准备地予以大力发展”的方针。
    根据上述方针，首先要扩充现有高等师范学校，其次是根据需要与可能，发展新的学校。为了解决中等学校师资问题，一面按正规学制培养合乎规格的师资，一面采取多种形式的临时过渡办法，如办短期训练班和用提前毕业办法等，以适当满足当前的迫切需要。同时要使今后高等师范教育，在发展过程中，注意提高质量，认真学习苏联的先进经验，密切结合中国的实际情况，稳步地进行教学改革，并注意团结提高现有教师和大力培养新师资。高等师范学校今天存在的问题是十分复杂的，有许多具体问题，如各地高等师范学校在整顿巩固方面、在教学改革方面的具体办法，除了中央教育部要根据这一次会议的决定，抓紧时间研究和拟订，并到下边协助工作以外，各级党委应对所在地的高等师范学校给以十分重视并实际地领导起来。
    过去几年，虽然各级党委和政府对于高等师范学校在恢复和发展方面作了很大努力，但要承认，我们仍未给以应有的重视。旧中国遗留下来的社会轻视师范教育的心理，未能得到应有的转变，目前青年中不愿学习师范，教师中不愿在师范性质的学校任教的心理，还相当普遍地存在。这成了当前师范教育事业发展上极大的阻力。虽然这里包含有极复杂的原因，但这是和我们没有把现有学校办好，对现有学校存在的许多问题没有及时地解决，对他们关心不够，尤其领导不够分不开的。我们固然要和这种有害的、旧中国遗留下来的轻视师范教育的心理作顽强的斗争，但最重要的是逐渐改变现有各级师范学校的状况，在事实上体现我们对它的重视。这就要求各级党委加强对高等师范学校的领导和改善教育部门及学校本身的领导状况。许多经验证明，凡一个地方的党委对学校注意多一些，学校领导懂得如何依靠党的领导，那个学校就办得好些，问题就少些，教师学生的情绪就安定些。
    今后按照统一领导、分层管理的原则，各地党委要按照中央的方针，从政治上、思想上和组织上给高等师范学校以强有力的领导，并不断改进教育行政部门和学校本身的领导，帮助解决一切重大问题，使高等师范学校受到党的经常的关怀、领导和严格的监督。各地党委要把当地高等师范学校工作，列入自己的议事日程，加强领导和检查。目前各学校的政治思想领导必须加强。各级党委首先要把高等学校教师的政治理论学习负责领导起来。其次必须协助教育行政部门解决学校急需的主要领导干部和政治理论课的骨干教师。必须领导、监督学校的党组织和政治辅导处在学校正确进行政治、思想工作。必须纠正有些学校中存在的党和群众间、教师学生间、新老教师间的不正常的关系以及学校缺乏浓厚的政治空气等不良现象。必须纠正教育行政部门和学校领导方面不向党委和上级请示报告，对许多重大问题自作主张的分散主义现象。这是整顿现有学校工作的最基本的环节。
    每一大行政区、每一省市，还须进一步摸清所属地区中等学校师资的情况，现有高等师范学校的情况和潜力，又要正确估计今后数年中等学校发展需要师资的数字（不仅一般的总的数字，还要分别学科性质、各种专业师资分类的数字），既要顾到必需的数量，又要保证一定的质量。这就需要实事求是地算出细账，再参照中央教育部提出的发展指标，作出自己的发展计划。否则五年计划是提不出的，一九五四年的计划作出来也会是不正确的。这一工作搞不好，就会使教育工作长期陷于无计划的被动状态。
    全国高等师范教育会议在许多根本问题上作出了结论，各地高等师范学校应该执行这次会议所确定的原则，贯彻其方针，履行所分担的任务。各校应一面充分发挥潜力，积极创造条件，拟订自己的发展计划，并切实执行；另方面应认真学习苏联的先进经验、密切结合中国实际情况、稳步前进，抓紧进行教学改革，克服在教学改革中偏高偏急的急躁情绪，同时纠正或防止安于现状、拖延不改的保守思想。最近这一时期，必须掌握教学改革的中心一环，解决教学计划、教学大纲和讲稿的问题，同时相应地解决教学组织和教学方法问题。必须通过教学研究组或教学小组，将教师组织起来，发挥集体主义的精神，团结合作，共同协力，提高教师对政治理论、教育科学的研究空气，解决教学上的问题。各校应在总结过去教学改革经验的基础上，改进自己的工作，定出切合学校实际的计划，稳步前进。学校要加强对教学工作的领导，加强教师的团结，纠正新老教师间，教师学生间的不正常的现象，充分发挥教师的积极性和互助精神，使教学改革和学校其他一切工作逐步前进。
    党和人民政府十分关心全国师范教育，重视各级师范学校的工作，关心人民教师的生活。师范教育和人民教师在我们国家建设中所占的重要地位是肯定了的。苏联的历史就为我们指出了前景。作人民教师的人，应认识到自己在国家建设事业中的光荣地位。要使社会尊重师范教育，要学生树立为人民教师的专业思想，首先就要求高等师范、师范学校的教师们为学生树立楷模，自己首先树立坚定的意志和为人民教育事业奋斗到底的决心。毫无疑义，我国师范教育必将取得崇高的地位而为全体人民所尊重。
