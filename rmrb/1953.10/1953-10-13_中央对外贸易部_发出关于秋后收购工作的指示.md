The Central Ministry of Foreign Trade issued instructions to the foreign trade commissioners at the ports and to the various export corporations regarding the autumn procurement work.

The instructions, after explaining the importance of the autumn procurement work, pointed out: In order to do this work well, it is necessary to formulate mutually connected procurement, domestic sales, and export plans for relevant export agricultural and sideline products from top to bottom, based on production conditions and domestic and foreign sales needs. Then, under the unified leadership of the local financial committee, actively organize procurement and resolutely prevent the occurrence of panic buying. For commodities that are selling well, the plan can be appropriately expanded for procurement, but this must be approved by the local financial committee to prevent indiscriminate grabbing; for certain slow-selling export commodities, procurement should be actively carried out according to the plan approved by the ministry, and it is not allowed to tighten or expand it without authorization, so as to both take care of farmers' sales needs and avoid creating national backlog; for some export commodities that farmers request to sell but there is currently no market abroad, in addition to local native produce companies and cooperatives organizing material exchanges and vigorously developing domestic sales, relevant export companies must also actively seek sales channels and find ways to export; for certain special circumstances such as supporting production and disaster relief that require procurement, commodities can be appropriately selected for procurement, but it must be reported to the ministry for approval in advance; for certain commodities that are not yet in peak season but are needed for both domestic and foreign sales, procurement should continue.

The instructions pointed out: All relevant export companies must fully rely on cooperatives, proactively sign procurement contracts with cooperatives, explain procurement and export policies and the specifications of export commodities to cooperative cadres, allocate funds in a timely manner as required, provide necessary and possible assistance to cooperatives in terms of technology, and ensure that cooperatives have a certain profit, but also require cooperatives to accurately execute the contract.

In order to stop illegal activities of private merchants speculating and disrupting the state's price policy, so as to stabilize the market and ensure the completion of the state-owned export commodity procurement tasks, foreign trade units must proactively cooperate with relevant departments to strengthen market management, regulate market supply, and appropriately adjust regional price differences; customs at ports must strictly examine and approve exports by importers and exporters in accordance with plans and laws. At the same time, for agricultural and sideline products related to exports that the state does not manage or cannot fully manage, private merchants should be allowed to actively operate under state policies and laws, and be given reasonable profits, in order to benefit production and increase national foreign exchange income.

The instructions finally pointed out: In terms of procurement methods, buying and selling must be fair, and acceptance procedures must be simple, in order to save farmers' time. It is also necessary to regularly report to local Party and government organizations, and rely on local Party and government organizations and cooperatives to conduct widespread and in-depth publicity and explanation to the masses regarding the procurement prices, commodity specifications, and procurement methods of state-owned export companies. Illegal acts of private merchants raising prices for panic buying should be exposed in a timely manner and stopped by the industrial and commercial administrative departments, and those whose illegal acts are serious should be punished according to law. In terms of business management, it is necessary to focus on the three links of storage, transportation, and processing, and vigorously improve them, and attention should be paid to theft prevention, fire prevention, temperature control, and moisture prevention. In short, it is necessary to save costs in all aspects, reduce losses, ensure commodity quality, and organize exports in a timely manner, thereby effectively accelerating commodity circulation, reducing export costs, and ensuring the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's profit delivery task.

    中央对外贸易部
    发出关于秋后收购工作的指示
    中央人民政府对外贸易部对口岸对外贸易特派员和各出口专业公司发出了关于秋后收购工作的指示。
    指示在说明秋后收购工作的重要意义后指出：为了作好这一工作，必须根据生产情况及内外销需要，对有关出口的农副产品自上而下作出相互衔接的收购、内销与出口计划，然后在当地财委统一领导下积极组织收购，坚决防止抢购现象的发生。对旺销顺销的商品，可适当扩大计划去收购，但须经当地财委批准，以防止乱抓；对若干滞销的出口商品，应按该部批准的计划积极去收购，不许擅自紧缩或扩大，以便既照顾农民销售要求，又不至造成国家积压；对有些出口商品农民要求销售而国外现无销路者，除各地土产公司与合作社组织物资交流，大力开展内销外，有关出口公司还必须积极寻找销路，设法外销；对某些为支持生产救灾等特殊情况而需要收购者，可适当选择商品予以收购，但须事先报部批准；对若干现在虽还不是旺季但内外销均需要的商品仍应继续进行收购。
    指示指出：各有关出口公司必须充分依靠合作社，主动地和合作社签订好收购合同，向合作社干部讲清收购、出口政策和出口商品的规格，在资金上要按规定及时拨付，在技术上也要给合作社以必要与可能的帮助，并使合作社有一定利润，但也应要求合作社准确执行合同。
    为了制止私商投机抢购和破坏国家价格政策的非法行为，以便稳定市场，保证国营出口商品收购任务的完成，对外贸易各单位必须主动地配合有关部门，加强市场管理，调剂市场供应，适当地调整地区差价；口岸海关对进出口商必须严格按照计划和法令审批出口。同时，凡国家不经营或不能全部经营的有关出口的农副产品，应允许私商在国家政策法令下积极经营，并予以合理利润，以利生产并增加国家外汇收入。
    指示最后指出：在收购方式上，买卖要公平，验收手续要简便，以节省农民的时间。并要向地方党政组织经常作报告，依靠地方党政组织及合作社将国营出口公司的收购价格、商品规格及收购办法，向广大群众进行普遍深入的宣传解释。对私商抬价抢购的违法行为，应及时予以揭露，并通过工商行政部门予以制止，其中违法行为严重者，应依法予以惩处。在经营管理上，必须抓紧保管、运输、加工三个环节，大力予以改进，并应注意防盗、防火、防温、防潮。总之，要从各方面节省费用，减少损耗，保证商品质量，及时组织出口，从而有效地加速商品流转，降低出口成本，保证完成和超额完成今年的上缴利润任务。
