Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, October 25th: Just as French and American news agencies were greatly exaggerating the recent invasion of the Ninh Binh and Thanh Hoa regions by French troops in Vietnam as "the largest offensive in the eight-year Indochina War," the French invading forces have once again suffered blows in actual combat with the Vietnamese People's Army.

In order to invade the liberated areas of Ninh Binh and Thanh Hoa provinces southwest of Hanoi, the French invading army headquarters actively gathered troops in early October and sent aircraft to frequently harass the areas slated for invasion and various parts of the Viet Bac liberated zone. By mid-October, the French invading army had amassed five mobile infantry regiments, an armored detachment, and three inland river flotillas along a line of less than 22 kilometers from Hoang Dan (formerly Huangtan) in northern Ninh Binh province to Dieu Cong in southern Ninh Binh province; and had concentrated eleven warships of various sizes and a large number of marines on the sea east of Thanh Hoa province. At the same time, the French invading army's paratrooper battalions in North Vietnam were also assembled in Hanoi, ready to support the invading French forces at any time.

On October 15th, the French invading army launched a large-scale invasion of the liberated areas of Ninh Binh and Thanh Hoa provinces. In the north, five mobile infantry regiments and three inland river flotillas of the French army, under the cover of armored units and aircraft, invaded Nho Quan district (i.e., Phu Nho Quan) west of Ninh Binh in three directions. In the south, several hundred French troops landed in the direction of Ngoc Trac, southeast of Thanh Hoa provincial capital, on the 16th. The enemy forces in the north and south formed an encirclement of the plain area connecting the third and fourth inter-zones of the liberated area. At this time, the French invading army headquarters declared triumphantly that their purpose was to "eliminate" the two main divisions of the Vietnamese People's Army in this area.

However, the brave and battle-hardened Vietnamese People's Army lured the French invading army into the area of Ly Nhan, Khoai Lao, and Lai Kha, more than ten kilometers southeast of Nho Quan district. On the night of October 18th, the People's Army suddenly launched an attack, severely damaging the invading French forces and capturing many spoils of war. Another People's Army unit launched an attack in Trai Ngoc, inflicting many casualties on the enemy. Prior to this, the enemy troops who landed on the coast of Thanh Hoa province had already been repelled on the 16th.

At the same time, the local forces and guerrillas of the Vietnamese People's Army operating behind enemy lines in the Red River Delta also actively launched attacks, seriously threatening the rear of the French invading army. The local forces of Thai Binh province, in coordination with the guerrillas, on October 17th, removed the enemy stronghold in Hau Dai, ten kilometers northwest of Thai Binh provincial capital, annihilating the puppet army's 400th and 403rd battalions. On the 18th, they ambushed the enemy along the Phu Thai and Dinh Thuong line, annihilating most of the first and third companies of the puppet army's second battalion. The local forces of Nam Dinh province attacked the enemy's Van Ly stronghold in the coastal area of Hai Hau district, annihilating the puppet army's 703rd and 707th light battalions.

The French invading army, attacked from the front and rear by the Vietnamese People's Army and guerrillas on the main battlefield and behind enemy lines, is bound to suffer even heavier blows.

Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: According to Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam: The General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army announced in a communique on the 23rd that in the five days of fighting since the enemy's invasion of southwestern Ninh Binh on October 15th, a total of fourteen enemy battalions, including two puppet army light battalions, were annihilated.

On the night of October 18th, the People's Army attacked two enemy strongholds in Ly Nhan, 22 kilometers from the capital of Ninh Binh province, killing 400 enemy soldiers, capturing 53, and seizing a 57mm cannon, three mortars, ten light and heavy machine guns, and many submachine guns and rifles. According to French prisoners of war, the enemy troops who suffered these casualties were all French troops. They had invaded Phu Giai, bordering Thanh Hoa and Ninh Binh, on October 18th. Now, the two enemy forces advancing towards Phu Giai and Dong Giao along Highway 1 have been repelled by the People's Army.

At the same time, the enemy troops landed in villages along the coast in southern Thanh Hoa province on October 16th, and were immediately blocked by guerrillas. The enemy suffered heavy casualties that evening and retreated in panic. The enemy in the northern and eastern regions of Thanh Hoa province, located between Ninh Binh province and the coast, was also repelled.

The People's Army of Nam Dinh province also annihilated three French battalions advancing southwest towards Ninh Binh province on October 18th. At the same time, the People's Army behind enemy lines in Nam Dinh province also intensified their activities. On the same day, 20 kilometers south of the Bui Chu area in Nam Dinh province, they annihilated the puppet army's 703rd and 707th light battalions, in which almost all of the enemy's staff officers were killed, wounded, and captured; seized four enemy mortars, 36 machine guns, 80 submachine guns and pistols, 140 carbines and rifles, and 20 radio transceivers. These military supplies were all made in the United States. In addition, two platoons of the puppet army's 710th light battalion were also defeated by the People's Army here four days ago.

In Thai Binh province, on October 18th, the People's Army intercepted the puppet army's second battalion on Highway 39, killing and capturing 166 enemy soldiers, including two captains.

The communique stated that the People's Army units that made contributions in the Ly Nhan campaign and the People's Army units that successfully conducted this battle in Nam Dinh province were awarded the Third Class Military Merit Medal by the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army.

    越南人民军五天歼敌十四个连
    进犯宁平清化地区的法军遭到沉重打击
    【新华社北越二十五日电】正当法国和美国通讯社把最近侵越法军对宁平、清化地区的进犯大事吹嘘为“印度支那八年战争中最大的一次攻势”的时候，法国侵略军队在实际战斗中又遭到越南人民军的打击。
    为了进犯河内西南的宁平省和清化省解放区，法国侵略军司令部在十月初旬就积极调集兵力，并派飞机到准备进犯的地区和越北解放区各地频繁骚扰。到十月中旬，法国侵略军在从宁平省北部的黄丹（前译黄檀）到宁平省南部的酉工这不到二十二公里一线上，再集结了五个机动步兵团、一个装甲支队和三队内河战舰；并在清化省以东的海面上，集结了十一艘大小军舰和大批海军陆战队。同时，法国侵略军在北越的伞兵营也都集结在河内，准备随时支援进犯的法军。
    十月十五日，法国侵略军开始向宁平省和清化省解放区大举进犯。在北面，法军五个机动步兵团、三队内河战舰，在装甲部队和飞机掩护下，分三路进犯宁平以西的儒关府（即府儒关）。在南面，法军数百名，十六日在清化省会东南的玉堂方向登陆。南、北两个方向的敌军，形成对解放区第三和第四联区衔接的平原地带的包围形势。这时候，法国侵略军司令部得意忘形地宣布：他们的目的在于“消灭”在这个地区内越南人民军的两个主力师。
    但是，英勇善战的越南人民军，把法国侵略军引进儒关府东南十多公里的里亚地方寅老、来卡一带。十月十八日晚，人民军突然发起攻击，重创进犯的法军，并缴获许多战利品；另一路人民军在寨玉发起攻击，使敌军遭受许多伤亡。在此以前，在清化省海岸登陆的敌军，早在十六日当天就被击退。
    同时，在红河三角洲敌后作战的越南人民军地方部队和游击队也积极出击，严重地威胁了法国侵略军的后方。太平省地方部队在游击队配合下，十月十七日拔除太平省会西北十公里处的后台地方的敌人据点，歼灭伪军第四○○、第四○三两个连。十八日，又在铺太、亭上一线设伏，歼灭伪军第二营第一连和第三连的大部。南定省地方部队在海后县滨海地区袭击敌军文里据点。歼灭伪军第七○三、第七○七两个轻装营。
    遭到越南人民军、游击队在正面战场和敌后战场的夹击而腹背受敌的法国侵略军，势将遭受更沉重的打击。
    【新华社二十四日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：越南人民军总司令部在二十三日发表公报说：自十月十五日敌人进犯宁平西南以来的五天战斗中，共歼灭敌人十四个连，其中包括两个伪军轻装营。
    人民军在十月十八日夜袭击了敌人在距宁平省会二十二公里处的里亚的两个据点。击毙敌军四百名，俘掳五十三名，缴获五十七公厘口径大炮一门、迫击炮三门、轻、重机枪十挺和手提机枪、步枪多支。据法国战俘说，这些遭受伤亡的敌军都是法国军队。他们在十月十八日曾向清化和宁平交界的普吉进犯。现在，沿着第一号公路向普吉和同交进犯的两路敌军已为人民军击退。
    同时，敌军在十月十六日在清化省南部的海岸一带村庄登陆，当即遭到游击队的阻击，敌军在当天晚上受到严重伤亡后，狼狈退走。介于宁平省和海岸之间的清化省北部和东部地区的敌军也被击退。
    南定省的人民军也在十月十八日歼灭了向宁平省西南推进的法军三个连。同时，南定省敌后的人民军也加紧活动，在同一天，在距南定省裴朱地区以南二十公里的地方，歼灭伪军第七零三和第七零七两个轻装营，其中敌军参谋军官差不多都被击毙、击伤和俘掳；缴获敌军迫击炮四门、机枪三十六挺、手提机枪和手枪八十挺（支）、卡宾枪和步枪一百四十支和无线电收发报机二十台。这些军用品都是美国造的。此外，在四天以前，伪军第七一零轻装营的两排敌军也在这里被人民军击溃。
    在太平省，十月十八日人民军在第三十九号公路上截击了伪军第二营，毙、俘敌军一百六十六名，其中有上尉两名。
    公报说：在里亚战役中立了功的人民军部队和在南定省胜利地进行这次战斗的人民军部队，都荣获了越南人民军总司令部奖给的三级军功章。
