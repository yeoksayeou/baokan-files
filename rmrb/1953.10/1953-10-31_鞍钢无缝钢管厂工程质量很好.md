The following was transmitted by Xinhua News Agency.

After a rigorous completion inspection, it was proven that the quality of the newly built seamless steel tube plant of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company is very good. It not only meets the design standards, but also exceeds them in many aspects. This lays a solid foundation for smooth production in the future.

The seamless steel tube plant is an automated and mechanized factory designed for China by the Soviet Union. The factory is large in scale, technologically complex, and requires very strict quality. For example, whether the center lines, elevations, and levels of mechanical and electrical equipment meet the design standards is crucial to the smooth operation of the entire factory. The design stipulates that the center line of general equipment cannot deviate by more than 50 dao (the thickness of a human hair is equal to 8 dao), the elevation cannot deviate by more than 100 dao, and the level cannot deviate by more than 2 dao per meter. However, according to the results of the completion inspection using the latest instruments, almost all of these deviations did not exceed the regulations. Generally, the elevation deviated by only about 30 dao, and most of the center lines did not deviate by even one dao. The clearances of equipment components also meet the requirements of the construction drawings. Therefore, when the final commissioning tests of all equipment in the factory were carried out, there were no abnormal noises, overheating, vibration, or other phenomena. The six major units of piercing, rolling, sizing, reducing, sizing, and straightening, known as the heart of the entire factory, reached zero point (i.e., no deviation) in terms of center line, elevation, and level, except for individual parts. During the final commissioning of the rolling mill, which has gears weighing more than 20 tons, it ran continuously for three hours at the highest speed of 750 revolutions per minute. The sound was low and uniform, and there was no vibration or overheating when touching the machine. Everyone present praised it. The Soviet expert who guided the operation tightly grasped the hands of the station chief of the technical inspection station of the technical supervision department and said happily, "Excellent! Excellent!" The installation quality of various electrical equipment in the factory is also very good. The largest DC generator in the main power room ran at a high speed of 750 revolutions per minute for eight hours. The temperature of the shaft only reached two-thirds of the allowable limit, and there was no noise at all. The vibration of the machine was also very small, and the pointer of the vibration meter only swayed two grids (four grids are allowed). If a bowl of water is placed on the machine, the water surface will not fluctuate. The Soviet electrical expert said, "Such installation quality is considered excellent even in the Soviet Union!"

The massive metal plant structure of the seamless steel tube plant, which bears the load of fifteen layers of roof, and the more than one hundred concrete foundations that bear the load of five to six thousand tons of mechanical and electrical equipment, are also very solid. During the trial operation of all mechanical and electrical equipment in the factory, no sinking, cracks, tilting, or other phenomena were found. Due to the uniform mixing of concrete and continuous pouring, the firmness of most of the concrete foundations of the factory building columns and mechanical equipment exceeds the design standard by more than 15%. The thousands of pipes that crisscross the entire factory are installed correctly, the joints of the pipe ends are welded firmly and tightly, and protective devices are installed, so there are no leaks; the water supply, oil supply, ventilation, and gas supply are all normal. The waterproof layer project of the cable trench, which is used to protect the total power supply and cable lines of the entire factory, is so sturdy that although it was completely submerged in water for two weeks during the heavy rain in September this year, not a drop of water渗入過.

The Soviet experts who helped Anshan Iron and Steel construction played a major and decisive role in ensuring the quality of the seamless steel tube plant project. Throughout the construction process, the Soviet experts not only helped the construction site establish many technical management systems, formulate technical operating procedures, and introduce many advanced experiences to ensure project quality and accelerate project progress, but also frequently went deep into the construction site to guide and inspect each major project, demonstrating a high degree of internationalism and a serious and responsible work style. Once, when some water was found in the flue of the heating furnace, the Soviet experts inspected and studied it for a whole week, and finally found the cause of the water seepage, ensuring the quality of the foundation waterproof layer. During the trial run of the sizing machine, there was some slight noise in the bearing. The inspectors believed that it could be considered qualified, but the experts suggested disassembling it for inspection and repair until no noise could be heard at all.

The leadership and the vast number of employees involved in the construction of the seamless steel tube plant also attached great importance to the quality of the project. When the seamless steel tube plant project entered the completion stage, Anshan Iron and Steel Company organized an acceptance committee composed of design, construction, production, and technical supervision departments, as well as thirteen professional acceptance groups, to repeatedly and carefully inspect the project quality for nearly two months. All projects that did not meet the design standards were repaired one by one. For example, the oil placement station No. 3 of the lubrication system was pressure tested seven or eight times until not a single drop of oil leaked from the oil pipe before the acceptance personnel signed off. During the construction process, the project leadership strictly implemented the principle of constructing according to the design drawings, and under the guidance of Soviet experts, adopted various technical measures to ensure the quality of the project. The workers, after the ideological education of "a century-old plan, quality first," have a strong sense of quality. They not only consciously abide by the operating procedures and construct according to the drawings, but also actively check the construction quality of others. When pouring concrete foundations, cement workers put forward the moving slogan "Mud is like flesh and blood, steel bars are like bones. To industrialize the country, we must not let the foundation get rickets," and ensured the quality of more than one hundred concrete foundation projects under difficult construction conditions. In August this year, industrial pipeline workers found some cracks in the welded joint of a ventilation pipe buried in the foundation. They endured the smoke and the danger of electric shock, and took turns drilling into the 30-meter-long pipeline to weld, finally making the quality of the pipeline meet the design standards.

    鞍钢无缝钢管厂工程质量很好
    经过严格的竣工验收证明：国营鞍山钢铁公司新建无缝钢管厂的工程质量很好，不但达到了设计标准，而且在许多方面还超过了设计标准。这就为今后顺利地进行生产打下了稳固的基础。
    无缝钢管厂是苏联为我国设计的一座自动化、机械化工厂。工厂的规模巨大，技术复杂，质量要求非常严格。如机械和电气设备的中心线、标高、水平等是否合乎设计标准，关系着全厂的生产能否顺利进行。设计规定：一般设备中心线不能差五十道（一根头发丝粗细等于八道），标高不能差一百道，水平每公尺不能差两道。但根据竣工验收中用最新式的仪器测量的结果，所有这些几乎都没有超过规定，其中标高一般都只差三十道左右，大部分中心线一道都不差。设备部件的间隙也都符合施工图纸的要求。因此，当全厂各项设备最后交工试车时，就没有发生过不正常的杂音、发热、震动等现象。被称为全厂心脏的穿孔、轧管、整径、减径、定径、矫正六大机组设备，除个别部分外，中心线、标高、水平都达到零点（即没有差一道）。其中带有二十多吨重齿轮的轧管机最后交工运转时，曾用每分钟七百五十转的最高速度连续运转了三个小时，声音又小又均匀，用手摸机器，既感不到震动，也感不到发热，在场的人莫不称好。指导运转的苏联专家紧紧地握着技术监督处技术检查站站长的双手，高兴地说：“太好了！太好了！”厂内各种电气设备的安装质量也非常好。主电室中最大的一台直流发电机，曾用每分钟七百五十转的高速运转八个小时，轴的温度只达到允许限度的三分之二，没有丝毫杂音。机器的震动也很小，震动仪的指针只摆动了两格（允许摆动四格）。如果机器上放一碗水，水面也不会波动。苏联电气专家说：“像这样的安装质量，在苏联也算是优等的！”
    无缝钢管厂负荷着十五层房盖的庞大金属厂房结构，负荷着五、六千吨重的机械和电气设备的一百多个混凝土基础，也都非常坚固。在全厂机械和电气设备试运转时，没有发现任何下沉、裂纹、倾斜等现象。由于混凝土搅拌得均匀并且作了连续浇灌，全厂厂房房柱和机械设备的混凝土基础的坚固程度，大部分都超过设计标准百分之十五以上。纵横密布在全厂的成千根管道，由于安装得正确，管头的接合缝焊接得牢实、严密，并设有保护装置，所以都没有漏泄现象；送水、送油、通风、通气等都很正常。用来保护全厂总电源供电和电缆线的电缆沟防水层工程，因为做得坚固，今年九月大雨期间虽然全部浸在水里两个星期，可是一滴水也没有渗入过。
    帮助鞍钢建设的苏联专家对保证无缝钢管厂工程质量，起了重大的决定性的作用。在整个施工过程中，苏联专家不但帮助工地建立起许多技术管理制度，制订技术操作规程，介绍许多保证工程质量和加快工程进度的先进经验，并且还经常深入工地，指导和检查每个主要工程，表现了高度的国际主义精神和认真负责的工作作风。有一次发现加热炉烟道中有些水，苏联专家就整整检查和研究了一个星期，终于找到了渗水的原因，保证了基础防水层的质量。整径机试车时，轴承有些微杂音，检查人员认为可以算合格，但专家却建议卸开来加以检查修理，直到听不到一点杂音为止。
    建设无缝钢管厂的领导方面和广大职工对工程质量也都非常重视。在无缝钢管厂工程进入竣工阶段时，鞍山钢铁公司方面就组织了一个由设计、施工、生产、技术监督等部门参加的验收委员会和十三个专业验收小组，对工程质量反复、细致地作了近两个月的检验。凡是不合设计标准的工程，都一一进行了补修。例如润滑系统三号置油站，曾试压七、八次，直到油管里一点油星都不渗出，验收人员才签字。在施工过程中，工地领导方面严格地执行了按照设计图纸施工的原则，并在苏联专家帮助下，采取了各种技术措施来保证工程质量。工人们经过“百年大计，质量第一”的思想教育，质量观念很强。他们不但自觉地遵守操作规程，按照图纸进行施工，并且还主动检查别人的施工质量。水泥工人在浇灌混凝土基础时，提出“泥浆如血肉，钢筋如骨头，要使国家工业化，不叫基础得软骨病”的动人口号，在困难的施工条件下，保证了一百多个混凝土基础工程的质量。今年八月，工业管道工人发现一个埋在基础里的通风管焊口有一些裂缝，他们就忍着烟呛，冒着传电的危险，轮流钻到三十公尺长的管道里去焊接，终于使管道的质量达到了设计的标准。  （新华社）
