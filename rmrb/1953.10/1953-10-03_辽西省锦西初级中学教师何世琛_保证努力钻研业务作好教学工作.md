Guarantees to Diligently Study Professional Skills and Do a Good Job in Teaching
Respected Chairman Mao:

	Our great People's Republic of China has been established for four years, and the construction of the motherland is progressing by leaps and bounds. The material and cultural life of the people is generally improving. This is inseparable from your wise leadership. On this National Day, let me report to you what is in my heart.

	I am from a poor peasant family and am over forty years old this year. The exploitation and oppression I suffered in the old society are hard to describe in words. After the liberation of Northeast China, my family of eight was allocated more than one *qing* of good land, and the poor days are gone forever. I went from teaching elementary school to teaching middle school. Because my cultural level is low and my professional knowledge is insufficient, the school leaders have arranged for me to participate in the Chinese Language Correspondence Specialization Class at Northeast Normal University this year. I am very happy. I never dreamed that a person in his forties would become a university student again. The Party and the People's Government are so concerned about cultivating me, I will definitely study hard and do a good job in teaching. My two daughters are now studying in middle school, and one son is in elementary school, enjoying the benefits of people's grants. They all deeply realize the care of the People's Government and are determined to respond to your great call to "study well, work well, and stay healthy," to be well-rounded students, and to become defenders and builders of the motherland in the future.

	I assure you: I will study hard, delve into professional skills, improve teaching quality, teach students well, and complete the teaching tasks assigned to me by the motherland.

    保证努力钻研业务作好教学工作敬爱的毛主席：
    我们伟大的中华人民共和国成立已经四周年了，祖国建设事业飞跃地进展着，人民的物质和文化生活普遍地在提高，这是和您的英明领导分不开的。在这国庆节的时候，让我向您报告一下我心里的话。
    我是贫农成分，今年四十多岁。在旧社会所受的剥削和压迫真是一言难尽。东北解放后，我家八口人分到一垧多好地，穷苦的日子一去不复返了。我由教小学而教上了中学。因为我文化水平较低，专业知识不足，今年学校领导方面又让我参加东北师范大学中国语文函授专修班学习。我感到万分高兴，做梦也没想到四十多岁的人又当大学的学生了。党和人民政府这样关心地培养我，我一定好好学习，做好教学工作。我的两个女孩子现在都在中学学习，一个男孩子在小学念书，享受着人民助学金的待遇。他们都深切认识到人民政府的关怀，决心响应您的伟大号召：“学习好，工作好，身体好”，做个全面发展的学生，将来成为祖国的保卫者和建设者。
    我向您保证：努力学习，钻研业务，提高教学质量，教好学生，完成祖国交给我的教学任务。
