Xinhua News Agency, 6th. According to the Vietnam News Agency: Guerrilla warfare in Laos has become increasingly fierce in the past few months.

　　Since the French aggressors suffered a disastrous defeat in northern Laos this spring, they have been intensifying their recruitment of puppet troops by various means, and at the same time concentrating their forces to launch many sweeps against the guerrilla bases and areas surrounding the newly liberated areas in northern and central Laos. However, they were countered by the Lao People's Liberation Army.

　　In early June, the Lao People's Liberation Army annihilated a company of European and African mercenaries north of Luang Prabang; on June 19, it ambushed two companies of enemy troops near Meng Song, killing and wounding more than 30 enemy troops, including two lieutenants and one second lieutenant; on July 11, it killed or wounded 20 enemy troops near Bang Bang area of Xieng Khouang province.

　　On August 8, the French army advanced on the newly liberated areas in northern Laos in two routes. The Lao People's Liberation Army ambushed one enemy route advancing along the Nam Ou River, immediately sinking four enemy troop carriers and killing more than 40 enemy troops; at the same time, it intercepted another enemy route, forcing them to flee back to the North Hu area.

　　In central Laos, the Lao People's Liberation Army successfully crushed many enemy sweeps in June and July, and on July 19, it uprooted an enemy stronghold seven kilometers from North Thuan. It burned and destroyed eight enemy trucks, one armored vehicle, and many machine guns; it seized many weapons.

    寮国人民游击战广泛展开
    【新华社六日讯】据越南通讯社讯：寮国的游击战在过去几个月中愈来愈激烈。
    法国侵略军自今年春天在寮国北部惨败以后，就一面使用各种手段加紧征募伪军，一面集中兵力向寮国北部和中部的游击根据地以及新解放区周围的地区发动了多次扫荡。但是，他们遭到寮国人民解放军的反击。
    寮国人民解放军六月初在琅勃刺邦以北歼灭欧非籍雇佣军一个连；六月十九日，在孟孙附近截击两连敌军，毙伤敌军三十多名，其中有中尉两名、少尉一名；七月十一日，在川圹省邦邦地区附近又杀伤敌军二十名。
    八月八日，法军分两路向寮国北部新解放区进犯。寮国人民解放军一面伏击沿南乌江进犯的一路敌军，当即击沉敌军运兵船四艘，击毙敌军四十多名；一面截击另一路敌军，迫使他们窜回北湖地区。
    在寮国中部，寮国人民解放军于六、七两月胜利地粉碎了敌军的多次扫荡战，并在七月十九日拔除距北顺七公里的一个敌军据点。焚毁和击毁敌军卡车八辆、装甲车一辆及机枪多挺；缴获许多军火。
