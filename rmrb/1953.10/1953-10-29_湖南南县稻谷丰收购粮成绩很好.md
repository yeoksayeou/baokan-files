Hunan's Nanxian County, located by Dongting Lake, has reaped a bumper rice harvest this year. The county's grain departments and cooperatives have emphasized grain procurement work and achieved remarkable results. Based on farmers' continued requests to sell grain, the county's leading organs criticized the complacency of cadres and continued to actively promote procurement work.

Nanxian began purchasing rice in early July this year. Before the start of procurement, the Nanxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Government convened a series of meetings with cadres from districts, townships, grain bureaus, banks, and cooperatives. A grain procurement work committee was established, personally led by Xu Shiwu, the county magistrate, and full preparations were made for the allocation of warehouses, procurement personnel, and procurement equipment. In July and August, the Nanxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held four county committee meetings specifically to discuss grain procurement work, promptly resolving difficulties in the procurement process. Local state-owned trading departments and cooperatives coordinated with grain procurement, strengthening the supply of materials. The supply plan of the county's cooperative headquarters for the third quarter was greatly expanded compared to last year, and after early rice came on the market, the original supply plan was nearly doubled. For example, the supply plan for fertilizers increased by more than double the actual sales volume in the same period last year. The supply plan of the China National Cotton Yarn & Piece Goods Corporation's Nanxian store for the third quarter was more than four times the actual sales volume in the same period last year. The county's cooperative headquarters also organized seven mobile supply and marketing teams to deliver a large number of industrial products to more remote rural market towns. Various purchasing stations improved their working methods, simplified purchasing procedures, and facilitated farmers' grain sales. More than sixty grain purchasing stations in the county generally achieved "fast inspection, fast weighing, fast ticketing, and fast payment." The purchasing stations prepared samples of rice grades, and during procurement, grades could be determined simply by comparing the samples, which was not only fast but also fair and reasonable, satisfying the masses. At the payment counter, the cashier first stacked the banknotes in denominations of 100,000, 50,000, and 10,000, and also calculated the price per two, per jin, and ten jin of grain according to the posted price and created a "price and quantity comparison table," so that pricing and payment were very fast during procurement and no errors occurred. The purchasing stations also set up awnings and prepared tea to entertain farmers selling grain. On July 28, the county saw an unprecedented record of purchasing 3.79 million jin of grain in one day. From the time early rice came on the market, the amount of grain purchased in the three months of July, August, and September increased by 47.6 percent compared to the same period last year.

When the county's procurement work achieved significant results, some cadres developed complacency and a relaxing mentality, unwilling to further find ways to continue procurement work. The county leadership promptly convened a meeting of responsible cadres from the County Grain Bureau, the County Cooperative Headquarters, and other relevant departments, criticizing the cadres' complacency and relaxing mentality, and analyzed and studied the current procurement situation. The meeting considered that, due to the county's emphasis on grain procurement and the adoption of a series of effective measures, great achievements had been made, but the original plan was not entirely realistic, and farmers still needed to sell a lot of grain, so it was necessary to further actively promote procurement work. After the meeting, the Nanxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County Grain Procurement Work Committee jointly organized a working group to investigate farmers' grain sales in Yanzhou Township, the first district. The results of the investigation showed that farmers still needed and were able to sell a lot of grain. For example, in Dongkang Village, out of the 55 farmer households in the entire village, 47 households were prepared to continue selling grain after the autumn tax or the late rice harvest. According to preliminary statistics, these 47 households needed to continue selling a total of 304 shi of grain (before the investigation, they had already sold 523 shi and 7 dou). The investigation also revealed that after selling grain, farmers needed to buy a batch of means of production and means of livelihood, especially cake fertilizer. If the cooperative did not have a guaranteed supply of cake fertilizer, some farmers would not plan to sell grain. The county's cooperative headquarters is now actively purchasing various materials according to the needs of farmers.

### 湖南南县稻谷丰收购粮成绩很好

    湖南南县稻谷丰收购粮成绩很好
    湖南省洞庭湖滨的南县，今年稻谷丰收。该县粮食部门和合作社重视购粮工作，获得显著成绩。该县领导机关根据农民继续售粮的要求，批判了干部自满情绪，继续积极开展收购工作。
    南县在今年七月初开始收购稻谷。在开始收购前，中共南县县委和县人民政府曾召开了一系列的区、乡干部、粮食、银行、合作社等单位的干部会议，成立了购粮工作委员会，由该县县长徐士武亲自领导这一工作，并对仓库、收购工作干部的配备和收购用的器材都作了充分准备。七、八两月内，中共南县县委会曾召开四次县委会议专门讨论粮食收购工作，及时解决收购工作中的困难。当地国营贸易部门和合作社配合粮食收购，加强了物资的供应工作。该县合作总社第三季度供应计划较去年扩大了很多，早稻上市后，又将原订供应计划扩大了近一倍。如肥料的供应计划比去年同期实销数增加了一倍多。中国花纱布公司南县商店第三季度的供应计划为去年同期实销数的四倍多。该县合作总社还组织了七个流动供应推销组，把大量工业品送到较偏僻的农村集镇。各收购站改进了工作方法，简化收购手续，便利农民售粮。该县六十多个粮食收购站一般都做到“验收快、过秤快、开票快、付款快”。收购站准备了稻谷等级的样品，收购时只要拿样品一对，便可确定等级，不但手续快，而且公平合理，群众满意。在付款处，出纳员先将钞票按十万、五万、一万叠好，又将每两、每斤、十斤谷的价钱，按牌价计算制成一张“金额数量对照表”，这样在收购时计价付款就很快，且不出差错。各收购站还搭设凉篷，预备茶水，招待售粮农民。七月二十八日，该县就出现了一天收粮三百七十九万斤的空前纪录。从早稻上市以来，七、八、九三个月内，该县购粮数量比去年同时期增加百分之四十七点六。
    当全县收购工作获得显著成绩时，部分干部产生了自满情绪和松气思想，不愿意进一步想办法继续开展收购工作。该县领导方面及时召集县粮食局、县合作总社等有关部门负责干部开会，批判了干部中的自满情绪和松气思想，分析研究了当时的收购情况。会上认为：该县由于重视购粮工作，采取了一系列的有效措施，做出了很大成绩，但原定计划不完全切合实际，农民需要卖出的粮食仍然很多，必须进一步积极开展收购工作。会后，中共南县县委会和县购粮工作委员会联合组织了一个工作组，到第一区滟洲乡调查农民的卖粮情况。调查的结果说明，农民需要和可能卖出的粮食仍然很多。如东康村全村五十五户农民，有四十七户准备在秋征或晚稻收割后继续出卖粮食。据初步统计，这四十七户共需要继续出卖粮食三百零四石（在调查以前，已经卖出五百二十三石七斗）。调查中同时了解到，农民出卖粮食后，都需要买进一批生产资料和生活资料，特别是需要买进饼肥。如果合作社没有饼肥等保证供应，有的农民就不打算卖粮。该县合作总社现正根据农民需要，积极采购各种物资。
