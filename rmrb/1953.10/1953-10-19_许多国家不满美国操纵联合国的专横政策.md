Xinhua News Agency, October 18th: At the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the United States' hegemonic policy of attempting to completely turn the United Nations into its tool has aroused dissatisfaction and opposition from representatives of many capitalist countries and some national bourgeois public opinion.

This phenomenon is clearly reflected in the recently concluded discussion by the Special Political Committee of the General Assembly on the issue of admitting new member states to the United Nations. In the discussion, the United States continued to violate the United Nations Charter, insisting on only allowing countries that meet the US's liking to join the United Nations, while unreasonably excluding some people's democratic countries from joining the United Nations. Representatives of many capitalist countries opposed the US's attitude in the discussion in one form or another. The Syrian representative said: "The United Nations is a global organization. It must not become the patent of privileged countries to sacrifice and harm other countries. … The purpose of drafting the (United Nations) Charter was to tolerate the peaceful coexistence of various economic, political and social systems in the world. … We must not deviate the United Nations from its normal direction, and refuse these countries to participate in our organization on the pretext that the systems of certain countries are not suitable for the tastes of a few members of our organization." The Norwegian representative also pointed out that on the issue of admitting new member states to the United Nations, member states of the United Nations should not adopt different positions based on their likes and dislikes of the social and political systems of these countries. The Indonesian representative said that this attitude damages the reputation of the United Nations. Representatives of Pakistan, Sweden, Norway, Burma, Indonesia, Denmark, Egypt and other countries expressed their support for the Soviet proposal to allow fourteen countries to join the United Nations at the same time.

The United States also adopted the same hegemonic policy when re-electing non-permanent members of the Security Council at this session of the General Assembly. According to the provisions of the United Nations Charter and the London Agreement, one of the non-permanent seats to be re-elected this time should be allocated to Eastern European countries, and Eastern European countries have supported Poland as a candidate for the Eastern European region this time. However, the United States disregarded all this and forcibly elected Turkey to the Security Council to occupy the seat of the Eastern European countries, even though Turkey had previously served as a candidate for the Middle East region. The voting record of the General Assembly shows that this practice of the United States is unpopular. A total of eight votes were held before the United States managed to gather enough votes to barely elect Turkey. Poland received the support of up to twenty-three votes in the voting. Even the British "Times" expressed dissatisfaction with this practice of the United States, saying that this was "forcing the General Assembly to make this far-fetched decision," which made it more difficult for the "United Nations to establish and maintain its worldliness."

The United States not only violates the United Nations Charter on many issues, but is also actively attempting to launch a full-scale attack directly on the United Nations Charter in order to completely transform the United Nations into an appendage of the US State Department. The United States has forcibly included the issue of amending the United Nations Charter on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. This conspiracy of the United States has caused unease in some national bourgeois public opinion. Many bourgeois newspapers in Western Europe pointed out that the purpose of the United States in attacking the United Nations Charter is to turn the United Nations organization into an anti-communist alliance and a tool of American policy. These newspapers said that if this attempt by the United States is not stopped, the United Nations organization may lose its world nature. The British "Daily Herald" accused that some Americans are trying to turn the United Nations into an anti-communist alliance, but the United Nations was established to unite countries to seek peaceful solutions to international problems, not to oppose some countries to other countries.

### 许多国家不满美国操纵联合国的专横政策

    许多国家不满美国操纵联合国的专横政策
    【新华社十八日讯】在联合国第八届大会上，美国企图彻底把联合国变为其御用工具的专横政策，引起许多资本主义国家代表和若干国家资产阶级舆论的不满和反对。
    这种现象明显地反映在大会特别政治委员会刚结束的关于准许新会员国加入联合国问题的讨论中。美国在讨论中继续违反联合国宪章，主张只让合乎美国心意的国家加入联合国，而无理排斥一些人民民主国家加入联合国。许多资本主义国家代表在讨论中用这种或那种形式反对美国的态度。叙利亚代表说：“联合国是一个世界性组织。它决不能成为特权国家的专利品来牺牲和损害其他国家。……起草（联合国）宪章时的目的就是容忍全世界各种经济、政治及社会制度和平共处。……我们不能使联合国脱离它的正常的方向，藉口某些国家的制度不适合我们这个组织的少数会员国的胃口，就拒绝这些国家参加到我们组织中来。”挪威代表也指出，在准许新会员国加入联合国问题上，联合国会员国不应该凭它们对这些国家社会和政治制度的好恶，而采取不同的立场。印尼代表说，这种态度损害了联合国的声誉。巴基斯坦、瑞典、挪威、缅甸、印尼、丹麦、埃及等国代表都表示支持苏联提案，同时准许十四个国家加入联合国。
    在这次大会改选安全理事会非常任理事国时，美国也采取同样的专横政策。按照联合国宪章及伦敦协定的规定，这次改选的非常任理事国中有一席应分配给东欧国家，而且东欧国家这次已支持波兰为东欧地区的候选国。然而，美国却不顾这一切，硬把土耳其选入安理会占据东欧国家的席位，尽管土耳其过去已曾充当过中东地区的候选国。大会投票记录表明，美国这种做法是不得人心的。一共举行了八次投票，美国才凑够票数勉强使土耳其当选。波兰在投票中最多一次曾获得二十三票的支持。甚至英国“泰晤士报”也对美国这一做法表示不满说，这是“强迫大会作出这个牵强附会的决定”，这使“联合国在建立和保持它的世界性”上更加困难。
    美国不仅在许多问题上破坏联合国宪章，而且还在积极企图直接向联合国宪章发动全面进攻，以彻底变联合国为美国国务院的附属机构。美国硬把修改联合国宪章问题列入了这届大会的议程。美国这种阴谋在一些国家资产阶级舆论中引起了不安。西欧不少资产阶级报纸指出，美国攻击联合国宪章的目的在使联合国组织沦为一个反共联盟，变为一个美国政策的工具。这些报纸说，如果不制止美国这种企图，联合国组织可能失去其世界性质。英国“每日先驱报”指责说，有些美国人企图把联合国变为一个反共联盟，但是联合国成立的目的是为了团结各国以求和平解决国际问题，而不是在使一些国家与另一些国家对立起来。
