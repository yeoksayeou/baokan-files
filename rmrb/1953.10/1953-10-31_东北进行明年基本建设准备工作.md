The Northeast region is actively preparing for basic construction in 1954. Currently, the relevant basic construction departments are diligently formulating the 1954 basic construction plan based on the basic construction control targets issued by the central government, or carrying out various preparatory work before the formulation. When issuing control targets at each level, all departments generally pay attention to resolutely implementing the principle of "concentrating forces to complete major projects." In order to avoid dispersing the use of forces, units are required to reduce certain projects and equipment items that are not urgently needed to ensure key construction. The Northeast Financial and Economic Committee has already balanced the design and construction forces and local building materials organizations in the entire region to meet the requirements of next year's plan.

In terms of the deployment of construction forces, the existing construction and installation forces in the region this year can generally meet the needs of next year's projects. For individual special projects, the competent department will set up professional construction organizations, and workers of certain special types of work will also be trained according to project needs. At present, the competent construction departments have begun preparing for winter training.

In order to ensure that projects can start on time after the thaw next year, material preparation has also begun. The total number of red bricks in reserve in the region can reach 1.3 billion, and each region will store them separately according to next year's project tasks. The Northeast Financial and Economic Committee has issued instructions, requiring not only the completion of the reserve task in quantity, but also ensuring that quality standards are met, and making full use of the city's transportation capacity in winter. Provinces and cities are also planning for the supply of sand and gravel. Key construction units are also actively carrying out the work of clearing up and ordering domestic and foreign equipment.

After completing the design tasks for this year's projects, the design departments are all learning through summarizing their work. The standard dormitory design and design budget quotas will be appropriately modified based on the problems found in this year's construction. The Northeast Construction Engineering Bureau is working with relevant departments to collect data and organize personnel to actively carry it out.

The task of engineering geological exploration is very large. Next year, preliminary estimates show that geological and hydrological drilling for housing construction alone will reach more than 20,000 meters in depth. However, the existing scattered exploration forces are difficult to complete this arduous task; at the same time, there is also a shortage of personnel for testing and geological conclusions. Relevant departments are studying how to cultivate and adjust forces.

### 东北进行明年基本建设准备工作

    东北进行明年基本建设准备工作
    东北区一九五四年度基本建设准备工作，现正积极进行。目前，各基本建设主管部门正在根据中央颁发的基本建设控制指标，紧张地编制一九五四年度的基本建设计划，或进行编制前的各项准备工作。各部门在逐级颁发控制指标时，一般都注意坚决贯彻“集中力量完成主要工程”的方针，为了避免分散使用力量，要求各单位削减某些不是迫切需要的工程和设备项目，以保证重点建设。东北财政经济委员会已就全区的设计、施工力量及地方建筑材料组织平衡工作，以适应明年计划的要求。
    在施工力量的部署方面，今年全区已有的建筑、安装力量，大体上可以满足明年工程的需要，个别特殊工程，主管部门将筹设专业施工机构，某些特殊工种的工人也将根据工程需要进行培养。目前各主管施工部门已开始为冬季训练做准备工作。
    为保证明年解冻后工程能按时开工，材料准备工作也已着手进行。全区红砖储备数量可达十三亿块，各地区将按照明年工程任务分别储存。东北财政经济委员会已发出指示，不仅要求在数量上完成储备任务，特别要求保证达到质量标准，并充分利用冬季的市内运输力量。砂石供应，各省市也在筹划。各重点建设单位对国内外设备定货的清理、订制工作，也在积极进行。
    设计部门在完成今年工程的设计任务后，都通过总结工作进行学习。关于标准宿舍设计及设计预算定额，均将根据今年施工中所发现的问题进行适当修改，东北建筑工程局正会同有关部门搜集资料，组织人员积极进行中。
    工程地质勘察的任务甚大，明年仅房屋建筑所需地质、水文钻孔，初步估计就深达两万多公尺。而现有的分散的勘察力量是难以完成这一艰巨任务的；同时化验、地质结论人员也感不足。各有关部门正在研究如何培养与调整力量。
