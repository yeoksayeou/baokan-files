    The 1953 National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Championships began on the afternoon of October 2nd.
    The afternoon's program included Labor Defense Exercises, group calisthenics performances, and preliminary and final rounds of track and field and cycling events.
    One thousand female students from various girls' middle schools in Beijing and one thousand male students from Tsinghua University and various middle schools in Beijing performed Labor Defense Exercises. Their lively and skilled movements earned enthusiastic applause from more than 20,000 spectators in the stands.
    The group calisthenics performed by 500 soldiers from the Public Security Forces left a deep impression on people. The audience intently watched their every neat and robust movement. When the performers rapidly formed a giant red five-pointed star and the words "Defend the Motherland," and formed a peace dove and the words "Defend Peace," enthusiastic applause repeatedly resounded throughout the venue.
    A total of five preliminary and final events were held in the afternoon, among which the women's hand grenade throw preliminary and final rounds and the men's 400-meter relay preliminary round broke national records.
    Seventeen female athletes participated in the women's hand grenade throw competition. The preliminary round resulted in six athletes qualifying for the final round. The final results were: first place, Liu Fu (North China), with a score of 45.21 meters; second place, Yang Yizhuang (People's Liberation Army), with a score of 44.76 meters; third place, Zhang Jiaqi (People's Liberation Army), with a score of 43.80 meters; fourth place, Ma Shuchun (Northeast), with a score of 42.87 meters. The scores of the top three all broke the national record of 43.60 meters.
    The men's 400-meter relay race fully demonstrated the athletes' resourcefulness and cooperative spirit. The preliminary round resulted in the East China, North China, Northwest, Northeast, Central South, and Southwest teams qualifying for the final. The East China team's score of 44.2 seconds broke the national record of 44.4 seconds.
    The men's 1,500-meter cycling final began. National cycling competitions are still a first in our country. When the People's Liberation Army athletes wearing red sportswear took the lead and sped along the track, the audience applauded and cheered for their skilled driving. Because the People's Liberation Army athletes had good physical strength and endurance, they won first place – Qian Huaiyu – and second place – Jiang Defu. Their scores were 2 minutes 27.3 seconds and 2 minutes 28.1 seconds, respectively; third place, Sun Wensheng (Northeast), with a score of 2 minutes 31.1 seconds.
    The women's 800-meter middle-distance race did not exist before liberation. The preliminary round results on the same day were also very good, with the highest being Wen Liping (People's Liberation Army) with 2 minutes 35.1 seconds.
    The men's 100-meter preliminary round was held in four groups. The preliminary round resulted in twelve athletes qualifying for the next round, many of whom broke their past scores.
