    Strengthen Tax Collection During Peak Season to Ensure Completion of National Tax Revenue Tasks
    Based on the tax revenue patterns of previous years and the national tax revenue situation from January to September this year, the fourth quarter is the season with the heaviest tax revenue tasks. This year, more than one-third of the national tax revenue plan's recurring tax revenue tasks will be concentrated in the fourth quarter, among which the income tax of private industrial and commercial enterprises must be seized and fully deposited into the treasury in November. Whether this task can be completed successfully is related to the balance of national fiscal revenue and expenditure, the stability of finance and prices, and the progress of national economic construction. Therefore, completing and over-completing this year's tax revenue plan is a very important task. Tax authorities at all levels must, under the guidance of local Party and government leading bodies, seize the opportunity, implement policies, act according to the law, prevent deviations, and earnestly do this work well.
    To complete this year's tax revenue task, we must grasp the current key points of tax work. In October and November, while not relaxing the routine tax revenue in the slightest, we should vigorously carry out the estimated tax assessment of industrial and commercial income tax. Because the total amount of income tax assessed from January to September accounts for a large proportion of the total industrial and commercial tax revenue in the fourth quarter, the success or failure of the estimated income tax assessment work directly determines whether the national tax revenue plan for this year can be completed. Thanks to the state's large investment in economic construction this year, increased industrial and agricultural production, increased people's purchasing power, and the results of adjusting commerce and expanding processing, ordering, sales, and procurement, the national market has experienced a more prosperous scene than in the past, with the off-season not being so off and the peak season arriving early. For example, in large cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shenyang, Harbin, Dalian, Chongqing, and Xi'an, the business volume of private industrial and commercial enterprises in the first half of this year has increased significantly compared with the same period last year. The business volume of private industrial and commercial enterprises in various small and medium-sized cities has also increased to varying degrees. And the third quarter was even better than the first and second quarters. Therefore, with the increase in the business volume of private industrial and commercial enterprises, the decrease in the expense ratio, and the increase in the profit rate, it is advantageous and fully possible to successfully complete this year's estimated income tax assessment work.
    In order to do a good job in the estimated income tax assessment work, Party and government organs in various localities should strengthen their leadership over this work, and leading cadres of tax authorities at all levels must personally get involved, find out the real situation of key households, and gain experience in tax collection work to promote the overall work. When carrying out the estimated income tax assessment, although the time should not be dragged on for too long, we should also prevent the practice of simply pursuing speed and doing things hastily. For example, it is inappropriate to simply adopt the pure profit rate or gross profit rate standards of the previous year for estimated assessment without starting from the actual business situation this year. Adopting this method will not only fail to complete this year's national tax revenue task, but may also produce phenomena of excessive or insufficient assessment. To this end, tax authorities at all levels should conduct more investigation and consultation, and conduct estimated assessment based on the actual business conditions of private industrial and commercial enterprises, neither underestimating nor overestimating, and seeking truth from facts.
    The commodity circulation tax and goods tax also account for a large proportion of the industrial and commercial tax tasks. In the fourth quarter, we must also seize the tax collection work of commodity circulation tax and goods tax. Some tax cadres believe that these two taxes are "managed by special personnel in large factories" and "the proportion of tax evasion in small factories is not large"; or they believe that these two taxes are "door-to-door taxes" and it is enough to guard the "gate"; some people even believe that there is no tax evasion at all in these two taxes, thus neglecting the audit and management work, giving lawless capitalists the opportunity to take advantage of loopholes. These views that are divorced from reality must be corrected. Facts have proved that in areas where in-depth inspections have been carried out, serious tax evasion has been found in these two taxes, and even tax-evading households that have never paid taxes have been discovered. According to the results of random checks by the tax bureaus of major and medium-sized cities, it has been proven that tax evasion is very serious. From January to August this year, the total amount of tax arrears of private industrial and commercial enterprises nationwide reached more than 448 billion yuan. Moreover, since the tax payment procedures have been simplified and the tax sources have been concentrated, a single tax evasion of commodity circulation tax and goods tax by lawless capitalists is equivalent to tax evasion of multiple taxes and multiple times in the past. This not only seriously affects the national fiscal revenue and national economic development, but also is not conducive to the operation of legitimate industrialists and businessmen. Therefore, tax authorities at all levels must strengthen the audit and management of commodity circulation tax, goods tax, and other taxes, and, under the leadership of local Party and government leaders, carry out the struggle against tax evasion and tax evasion and the work of clearing up tax arrears in a planned and focused manner.
    According to local experience, methods such as self-inspection and supplementary reporting by industrial and commercial households, mass supervision, and reporting can be adopted to combat tax evasion. When carrying out self-inspection and supplementary reporting, industrial and commercial households should be informed that the government may not punish industrial and commercial households who voluntarily conduct self-inspection and supplementary reporting, and those who are reported or found will be punished according to the severity of the circumstances, but those who are stubborn and serious tax evaders will be resolutely cracked down on. When carrying out this work, we must also rely on the assistance of employees and shop assistants. Employees and shop assistants of private enterprises have the responsibility to supervise capitalists to no longer commit the "five poisons". Tax cadres relying on employees and shop assistants to protect taxes is a problem that must be paid attention to in the concrete implementation of the mass line in the people's tax work. Since liberation, thanks to the high degree of enthusiasm of employees and shop assistants in protecting taxes, under the leadership of local trade union organizations, many cities have achieved success in the tax assistance work of employees. Recently, in the self-inspection and supplementary reporting campaign in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles, thanks to the active supervision of the vast number of employees and shop assistants, helping capitalists to improve their understanding, or making reports, the smooth progress of the self-inspection and supplementary reporting struggle has been promoted. These experiences should be summarized and widely promoted. At present, some tax cadres do not pay enough attention to the tax protection work of employees and shop assistants, or do not cooperate properly; a small number of shop assistants are blinded by lawless capitalists, cover up for them, and condone tax evasion, which must be educated and corrected.
    It is the glorious duty of tax cadres to collect all taxes that should be collected in full according to the actual tax sources and in accordance with tax laws and regulations. In the past nine months, under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, all tax cadres have worked hard, continuously improved and improved their working methods, and corrected the erroneous views and practices of only caring about tasks and not policies, and have achieved many results. However, at present, some tax cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the situation of national economic development and are satisfied with the achievements they have already made; or because they have corrected forced orders, they have produced phenomena of shrinking back, no longer paying attention to improving and strengthening audit and management work, and relaxing the management of industrial and commercial households; some cadres even believe that "tax refunds are the implementation of policies, and tax investigations are task-oriented," and "collecting as much as you can is implementing policies," which are all harmful misunderstandings of tax work and must be quickly corrected. However, while correcting the phenomenon of shrinking back, it is also necessary to strictly prevent the practice of adopting inappropriate methods to complete tasks without following policies. All tax cadres should recognize the consistency of national tax policies and tasks. It is certainly wrong to complete tasks beyond the limits allowed by policies; but it is also wrong to oppose policies and tasks, so that the taxes that should be collected are not fully collected or undercollected. Only by correctly implementing tax policies, seeking truth from facts, and acting according to law can we achieve "resolutely collecting all that should be collected, and resolutely not collecting all that should not be collected."
    There are only two months left in 1953, tax authorities in various localities should concentrate their efforts, organize revenue, and ensure the completion of the tax revenue plan. Industrial and commercial circles across the country must correctly understand that the responsibility of paying taxes to the state is a glorious obligation, enthusiastically pay taxes, oppose tax evasion, and support the large-scale construction of our great motherland with concrete actions of patriotic tax payment.

### 加强旺季征收工作，保证完成国家税收任务

    加强旺季征收工作，保证完成国家税收任务
    根据历年税收的规律和今年一至九月份全国税收的情况，都说明第四季度是税收任务最繁重的季节。今年占国家税收计划三分之一以上的经常性税收任务将集中在第四季度完成，其中私营工商业的所得税更须抓紧在十一月份完全入库。这一任务的能否圆满完成，关系着国家财政收支的平衡、金融物价的稳定和国家经济建设的进行。因此，完成与超额完成今年税收计划是一项十分重要的任务。各级税收部门必须在当地党政领导机关指导下，抓紧时机、贯彻政策、依法办事、防止偏差，认真作好这一工作。
    完成今年税收任务，必须抓住当前的税收工作重点。十月十一月两个月税收重点应在经常税收丝毫不能放松的基础上，大力作好工商业所得税估征工作。因为一至九月份所得税估征总数在第四季度工商税收入总额中占着很大的比重，所得税估征工作做的好坏，直接决定着今年国家税收计划的能否完成。由于国家今年对经济建设的大量投资，工业、农业的增产，人民购买力的提高，以及调整商业，扩大加工、订货、包销、收购的结果，今年全国市场淡季不淡，旺季早临，出现了较之过去更为繁荣的景象。如上海、天津、北京、广州、武汉、沈阳、哈尔滨、旅大、重庆、西安等大城市今年上半年私营工商业营业额较去年同期增加很多。各中小城市私营工商业的营业额也有程度不同的增加。而第三季度又比一、二季度更好。因此，在私营工商业营业额增大、费用率降低、利润率提高的情况下，胜利完成今年所得税估征工作是具备有利条件与充分可能的。
    为了作好所得税估征工作，各地党政机关应加强对这一工作的领导，各级税务机关领导干部必须亲自动手，摸清重点户的真实情况，取得征收工作的经验，用以推动全面。在进行所得税估征时，时间虽不宜拖得很长，但也应防止单纯图快、潦草从事的做法。例如不从今年营业实际情况出发，简单地采用上年度的纯益率或毛利率标准进行估征，这是很不妥当的。采用这种办法，不仅不能完成今年国家税收任务，而且还可能产生畸轻畸重的现象。为此，各级税务机关应作到多调查多协商，根据私营工商业的实际营业情况，既不少估，也不多估，实事求是地进行估征。
    商品流通税、货物税在工商各税任务中所占的比重也是很大的。在第四季度，也必须抓紧商品流通税、货物税的征收工作。有些税务干部认为这两种税“大厂有人专管”、“小厂偷漏税款所占比重不大”；或认为这两种税是“上门税”，把住“大门”就行了；甚至有些人认为这两种税根本没有什么偷漏现象，因而忽视稽征管理工作，给不法资本家以钻空取巧的机会。这些脱离实际的看法，必须加以纠正。事实证明：凡是经过深入检查的地区，都发现了这两种税的偷漏现象是严重的，甚至还发现了从未纳税的漏户。根据各大中城市税务局抽查结果，证明偷漏现象是十分严重的。今年一至八月份全国私营工商业拖欠税款达人民币四千四百八十余亿元之多。而且由于纳税手续简化了，税源集中了，不法资本家偷漏一次商品流通税、货物税，就等于偷漏了过去的多种税、多次税。这不但严重地影响了国家财政收入和国家经济发展，同时也不利于正当工商业者的经营。因此，各级税收部门必须加强商品流通税、货物税和其他各税的稽征管理工作，在当地党政领导下，有计划、有重点地进行反偷税、漏税的斗争和清理欠税的工作。
    根据各地经验，反对偷税漏税可以采取工商户自查补报，群众监督和检举的办法。在开展自查补报时，应向工商户说明：政府对于自动进行自查补报的工商户可不处罚，对被检举或被查出的工商户按情节轻重分别予以处罚，但要坚决地打击顽固而又严重的偷漏户。在进行这项工作时，还要依靠职工店员的协助。私营企业的职工店员有监督资本家不再重犯“五毒”的责任。税务干部依靠职工店员护税，这是人民税务工作具体贯彻群众路线必须注意的问题。解放以来，由于职工店员高度发挥了护税的积极性，在当地工会组织的领导下，很多城市职工的协税工作是有成绩的。最近，上海工商业界在开展自查补报中，由于广大职工店员主动监督，帮助资方提高认识，或进行检举，从而推进了自查补报斗争的顺利进行，这些经验，应该加以总结并广泛推行。目前有一些税收干部，对职工店员护税工作重视不够，或配合得不恰当；少数店员为不法资本家所蒙蔽，替他们打掩护，纵容偷税，这是必须加以教育和改正的。
    根据实际税源、依照税法规定把应收的税十足收齐，这是税务干部的光荣职责。过去九个多月当中，全体税务干部在各级党委和政府领导下，艰苦努力，不断提高和改进工作方法，纠正那些只顾任务不顾政策的错误观点和错误做法，曾经取得了不少成绩。但目前尚有部分税务干部对国家经济发展的形势认识不足，满足于已有成绩；或者由于纠正强迫命令，又产生了缩手缩脚的现象，不再注意改进和加强稽征管理工作，放松了对工商户的管理；甚至有的干部认为“退税是贯彻政策，查补是任务观点”、“收多少算多少，就是执行政策”，这都是对税收工作有害的错误认识，必须迅速纠正。但纠正缩手缩脚的现象，也必须严格防止那种不根据政策，而采取不适当的方法去完成任务的做法。全体税务干部应该认识到国家税收政策与任务的一致性。超过政策所允许的界限去完成任务，固然是错误的；但如果把政策与任务对立起来，以致应收的税收不齐，或少收了，那也是错误的。只有正确地贯彻税收政策，实事求是，依法办事，才能作到“应收的坚决收齐，不应收的坚决不收”。
    一九五三年度只有两个多月了，各地税务机关应集中力量，组织收入，保证完成税收计划。全国工商界必须正确认识向国家纳税责任是光荣义务，踊跃缴纳税款，反对偷税漏税行为，以爱国纳税的具体行动，支持我们伟大祖国的大规模建设。
