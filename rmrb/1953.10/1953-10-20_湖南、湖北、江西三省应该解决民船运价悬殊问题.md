    The Provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Should Resolve the Disparity in Civil Boat Freight Rates
    Ding Qi of the Hunan Provincial People's Government Grain Bureau writes: The provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi have crisscrossing rivers and lakes, and a large proportion of goods rely on civil boat transportation. However, the freight rates for civil boats stipulated by these three adjacent provinces differ greatly, causing many difficulties in the management of civil boats.
    In February of this year, the transportation departments of Hunan Province, together with various consigning units within the province, the Civil Boat Joint Transportation Cooperative, and the Steamship Industry Association, formed a freight rate office to jointly and meticulously calculate the cost of civil boat transportation and set the freight rates for major rivers. However, because the civil boat freight rates in Jiangxi and Hubei provinces exceeded those in Hunan Province by nearly double, a large number of Hunan civil boats flowed out, affecting the transportation of urgently needed materials. On the other hand, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other places experienced a surplus of civil boats. Recently, in order to complete urgent transportation tasks, the Hunan Provincial Transportation Department had to send cadres to Hubei to mobilize 10,000 tons of boats to return.
    This unreasonable phenomenon of freight rate disparities in neighboring areas has existed for a long time and has not yet been resolved. It is recommended that the relevant departments in the Central and South China region should consider and resolve this issue in a comprehensive manner, and improve and strengthen the management of civil boats to facilitate the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.
    Editor's note: For a long period to come, leveraging the role of civil boats in water transportation will be of great significance to the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. The disparity in civil boat freight rates in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other places is obviously detrimental to the development of inland waterway transportation. Of course, due to different specific conditions in various places, it is not possible to rigidly unify civil boat freight rates, but it is possible to make them roughly similar. It is hoped that the relevant departments in the Central and South China region and the transportation departments of various provinces will jointly study and resolve this issue.

### 湖南、湖北、江西三省应该解决民船运价悬殊问题

专栏：读者来信摘要

    湖南、湖北、江西三省应该解决民船运价悬殊问题
    湖南省人民政府粮食厅丁琦来信：湖南、湖北、江西三省河道纵横，湖港交错，很大一部分货物依靠民船运输。但是，这三个毗连的省规定的民船运价相差悬殊，使民船管理工作发生很多困难。
    湖南省的交通运输部门在今年二月份曾会同省内各托运单位及民船联运社、轮船业公会组成运价办公室，共同详细核算了民船运输的成本，并订出了大河运价。但由于江西和湖北两省的民船运价超过湖南省将近一倍，以致湖南民船大量外流，影响到急运物资的运输。而湖北、江西等地却呈现了民船过剩的现象。最近湖南省交通部门为了完成紧急运输任务，不得不派干部至湖北动员了一万吨船只回来。
    这种邻近地区运价悬殊的不合理现象已存在很久，直到现在还没有得到解决。建议中南区有关主管部门应统盘考虑和解决这一问题，改进与加强对民船的管理工作，以利城乡物资交流。
    编者按：在今后一个很长的时间内，发挥民船在水上运输中的作用，对城乡物资交流有重大意义。湖南、湖北、江西等地民船运价悬殊的现象，对内河航运事业的发展，显然是不利的。固然，由于各地具体情况不同，对民船运价不能硬性地统一规定，但作到大体上接近还是可以的。希望中南区有关主管部门和各省交通运输部门，共同研究解决这个问题。
