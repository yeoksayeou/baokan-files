    Central and Local Professional Departments Actively Carry Out Table Clearing Work
    The Phenomenon of Indiscriminate Issuance of Statistical Tables Has Begun to Be Overcome
    Since the State Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Clearing Existing Survey and Statistical Tables and Prohibiting the Indiscriminate Issuance of Survey and Statistical Tables," table clearing work has gradually begun throughout the country.
    The State Statistical Bureau of the Central People's Government convened a meeting of central ministries to clear report forms and established a "Report Form Clearing Office" responsible for inspecting and supervising table clearing work nationwide. Most central ministries, under the personal leadership of the minister and the specific leadership of the director of the general office or the director of the planning department, established dedicated agencies to carry out the clearing work. The Ministry of Railways, with Vice Minister Wu Jingtian as the head, established the "Ministry of Railways Report Form Review and Streamlining Committee."
    East China, Northeast China, Southwest China, and Northwest China have also successively begun clearing work. For example, the East China region, under the leadership of Vice Chairman Tan Zhenlin of the East China Administrative Committee, established a "Report Form Clearing Office." Currently, the report form clearing work in major administrative regions, provinces, and cities has basically transitioned to the review and processing stage.
    Due to the unfolding of the clearing work, phenomena such as the indiscriminate issuance of forms, impractical report content, and excessive volume have begun to be overcome.
    The phenomenon of central and local professional departments indiscriminately issuing statistical reports to their affiliated enterprises has also begun to be corrected after the clearing, reducing unnecessary burdens on enterprises. For example, the East China Branch of the People's Bank of China issued and forwarded as many as 150 kinds of reports last year. After the clearing, it retained seven kinds of self-issued reports and eighteen kinds of reports forwarded to the central government, totaling twenty-five kinds, which is only one-sixth of the previous number. The vehicle, locomotive, and commerce departments of the Central Ministry of Railways used to issue a total of 1,440 kinds of forms, leaving 499 kinds, accounting for slightly more than one-third of the original number. In rural areas, the number of forms has generally been greatly reduced. Taking Chenliu County, Henan Province, as an example, under the active leadership of party and government organs, an enlarged county-wide statistical meeting was convened, and the cadres attending the meeting were organized to study the instructions of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Government on clearing forms. This made everyone aware of the significance of clearing report forms and understood the clearing methods. After the clearing, out of the 375 kinds of report forms currently in use in the county, 110 kinds were retained (this number is still too large and should continue to be streamlined). Through the inspection and clearing of forms, the leading departments further examined the subjectivism, decentralism, and bureaucratism in their work, which also played a certain role in improving leadership style and working methods.
    However, there are still a few departments that are taking a perfunctory attitude towards the work of clearing report forms, and they still do not know how many forms their departments have issued; the clearing work has not been carried out well. According to the instructions of the State Council, the clearing work should be completed in November. Departments that have not yet seriously carried out this work must quickly seize the time to do so.

    中央及地方各专业部门积极进行清理表格工作
    滥发统计表格现象已开始克服
    自中央人民政府政务院“关于清理现行调查统计表格及禁止乱发调查统计表格的指示”发出以后，全国各地逐步开始了清理表格的工作。
    中央人民政府国家统计局曾召集了中央各部的清理报表会议，并成立了“清理报表办公室”，负责检查督促全国范围内的表格清理工作。中央各部多在部长亲自领导下，由办公厅主任或计划司司长具体领导，设立了专责机构，进行了清理工作。中央铁道部以武竞天副部长为主，成立了“铁道部报表审查精简委员会”。
    华东、东北、西南、西北等地也先后开始了清理工作。例如，华东区在华东行政委员会谭震林副主席的领导下成立了“清理报表办公室”。目前各大行政区、各省市清理报表的工作基本上已转入复查和处理阶段。
    由于清理工作的展开，乱发表格以及报表内容不切实际和份量过重等现象已开始克服。
    中央及地方各专业部门对所属企业单位滥发统计报表的现象，经过清理后也开始纠正，减轻了企业单位的不必要的负担。如人民银行华东区行去年自颁与转颁的报表达一百五十种之多，经过清理以后，保留了自颁的报表七种、转颁中央的报表十八种共二十五种，仅及过去的六分之一。中央铁道部车辆、机务、商务三个部门，过去颁发各种表格共一千四百四十种，留下四百九十九种，占原有数三分之一强。在农村中，表格一般的都大为减少。以河南陈留县为例，在党、政机关积极领导下，召开了全县扩大统计会议，组织到会干部学习了中共河南省委及省人民政府关于清理表格的指示。这样就使大家认识了清理报表的意义，并了解了清理的办法。经过清理以后，在全县现行三百七十五种报表中，保留了一百一十种（此数仍然太多，应继续精简）。通过表格的检查和清理，各领导部门进一步检查了工作中的主观主义、分散主义和官僚主义，对改进领导作风和工作方法也起了一定的作用。
    但目前还有少数部门对清理报表工作采取敷衍了事的态度，直到现在还不知道本部门究竟发了多少表格；清理工作也没有很好地进行。根据政务院的指示，清理工作应在十一月份完成，目前凡未认真进行这一工作的部门必须迅速抓紧时间进行。
