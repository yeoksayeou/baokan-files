    For a Common Purpose

    In the play "Dawn Shines on Moscow," agricultural team leader A.S. Ryzhov of the Agricultural City Collective Farm proposed to Sanya, an advanced worker at the Moskvichka Textile Factory, to implement a liaison system so that "everyone working in this liaison system understands the importance of their work and knows they are producing the best and most beautiful products." Here, between the Taiyuan Paper Mill and the Shanxi Provincial Department Store, we see an example of good results achieved through the initial implementation of a production-sales liaison system. The Shanxi Daily introduced this liaison system to its readers and gave it high praise.

    According to a report in the Shanxi Daily on September 9, the Taiyuan Paper Mill's products in 1952 were difficult to sell due to poor quality, and the vast majority of the products were stockpiled. As a result, not only did the factory face serious production difficulties, and wages could not be paid on time, but it also affected the implementation of the economic accounting system of the Shanxi Provincial Department Store, which sold the factory's paper. According to the Taiyuan Department Store wholesale station, the value of the Taiyuan Paper Mill's paper stockpiled at the station was more than double the approved total commodity funds. However, due to the factory's active efforts to improve product quality this year, the situation has completely changed. The factory's new products in 1953 enjoy a high reputation in the market and have become fast-selling items in short supply. For example, the sales volume in Taiyuan in July was more than three times greater than in March before the new products were launched. Department store wholesale stations and some factory users in Hankou, Jinan, Xuzhou, and other places have sent letters requesting to order the factory's paper. The Ministry of Foreign Trade has also selected Taiyuan typing paper as a standard product to participate in exhibitions.

    How was the product quality of the Taiyuan Paper Mill able to be improved so rapidly and significantly? The Shanxi Daily pointed out in its report that the production-sales liaison system established between the factory and the Shanxi Provincial Department Store played a significant role in this regard. When a large number of the factory's inferior products were stockpiled, both the producer and seller urgently demanded a solution to the problem, so they held two production-sales joint meetings. At the meetings, the department store put forward suggestions for improving the quality of the paper based on the needs and requirements of consumers. The leading cadres of the Taiyuan Paper Mill humbly accepted these opinions, deeply felt that "quality is the first life of a paper mill," and conveyed these opinions to the workers. Later, they also read the users' critical letters to the workers. Consumers' criticisms and opinions were a realistic and vivid education for all employees of the factory. For example, female worker Wang Xiuying said sadly: "We work in the workshop all day long, but we produce bad things that are not popular!" After everyone realized that production was to serve consumers, they struggled to improve quality with a sense of ownership. Through vivid examples such as the workers in the preparation workshop taking the initiative to improve the selection of materials and labor model Hou Xiaoxian painstakingly searching for the reasons affecting product quality, the Shanxi Daily introduced the situation of the factory's workers using their brains, finding ways, actively putting forward rationalization proposals, and promoting advanced experience in order to improve quality. After several months of continuous efforts and continuous improvement by all the factory's employees, the black spots on the paper were greatly reduced, and the whiteness, tightness, uniformity, and water resistance of the paper were improved… The factory's products changed from being unpopular with consumers to being very popular.

    The production-sales liaison system between the Taiyuan Paper Mill and the Shanxi Provincial Department Store not only helped the paper mill's employees establish a high sense of responsibility for product quality but also greatly encouraged the work enthusiasm of the department store's salespersons. The Shanxi Daily did not neglect this important aspect in its report. The report said that the department store's paper salespersons were extremely happy after the Taiyuan Paper Mill's new products were launched in 1953. Model salesperson Wang Jinkang said: "What we say is really effective. We made suggestions in March, and the paper mill produced excellent paper in May." Encouraged by the paper mill workers' actions to rapidly improve product quality, many salespersons also came up with many sales methods and expanded the turnover. Model salesperson Wang Jinkang also hoped to establish regular contact with the paper mill's workers and promptly reflect consumers' opinions to them. For this purpose, Wang Jinkang wrote a letter to Hou Xiaoxian, a labor model at the Taiyuan Paper Mill, and received a reply from Hou Xiaoxian. In the letter, both sides reported on their sales and production situations and expressed their intention to make this contact regular in order to encourage and promote each other and strive for the common purpose of better meeting the needs of the people. This is an advanced initiative. The Shanxi Daily supported their initiative, prominently published their correspondence, and published their photos.

    Naturally, the liaison system between the Taiyuan Paper Mill and the Shanxi Provincial Department Store is only a budding one and has not yet consciously formed into a regular system. However, the Shanxi Daily paid great attention to this budding new thing and published a commentary, which clarified the economic and political significance of this production-sales liaison system. It pointed out that establishing a production-sales liaison system between state-owned industrial departments and state-owned trade departments will play a certain role in improving the quality of industrial products, meeting the growing material needs of the vast number of consumers, further strengthening urban-rural relations, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The Shanxi Daily also proposed the main contents of this production-sales liaison system based on the practice of the Taiyuan Paper Mill and the Shanxi Provincial Department Store, that is, on the one hand, the leaders of both sides should establish a regular liaison system, exchange production and sales information through meetings, correspondence, and other methods, and sign and revise production and sales contracts based on consumer opinions and industrial production conditions to promote the development of both sides' businesses; on the other hand, mobilize the advanced workers of both production and sales sides to directly contact, communicate, hold forums, visit, and exchange opinions, encourage each other, and jointly do a good job in production and sales. As for the promotion of this system, the Shanxi Daily pointed out that it can be piloted first with emphasis based on the work needs of industrial and trade departments, and then gradually promoted; this is correct.

  Turning Low-lying Land into Paddy Fields

    The Anhui Daily published reports on changing low-lying areas north of the Huai River to rice cultivation in a relatively concentrated manner on the first and second pages on September 15. In many low-lying areas in northern Anhui Province, farmers never grow rice and are accustomed to growing crops such as sorghum, soybeans, and sesame. Low-lying areas often suffer from waterlogging, and sometimes there is even no harvest, making them unsuitable for growing these miscellaneous grain crops. In order to turn water disasters into water conservancy, the Huai River Harnessing Committee, in conjunction with drainage and irrigation projects, selected Xujiagang, which is representative in terms of soil and terrain, to start a trial planting of rice this spring. The working group of the Farmland Water Conservancy Department of the Huai River Harnessing Committee also conducted typical experiments on the Cui Beiping and Song Zaiyi mutual aid groups in Baoji District and Xinmaqiao District of Huaiyuan County. It has now been proven that the yield of rice is more than double that of miscellaneous grains. As the newspaper said in its report "The Xujiagang Rice Cultivation Experimental Farm in the Lower Reaches of the North Fei River Achieves a Bumper Harvest by Converting Dry Land to Rice Cultivation": The North Fei River Rice Cultivation Experimental Farm planted 49 mu of rice this year. According to the 41 mu of early rice and mid-season rice that have been harvested, the average yield is 500 jin of rice per mu (air-dried and winnowed). According to local farmers, this is equivalent to two seasons of soybeans. The result of changing to rice cultivation not only educated farmers to realize that the harvest of rice cultivation is more than that of miscellaneous grain cultivation but also reversed the farmers' perception that "leaky soil" cannot be used to grow rice. The newspaper specifically described this change in farmers in the reports "Preliminary Experience of Successful Trial Planting of Rice in Xujiagang Rice Cultivation Experimental Farm in North Fei River," "From Doubt to Belief," and "Farmers' Representatives from Fuyang and Su County Visit North Fei River Rice Cultivation Experimental Farm." For example, when the "Rice Cultivation Experimental Farm" in North Fei River was first established, the farmers in the surrounding villages always believed that Xujiagang suffered from water disasters every year, and the soil was "leaky soil" that could not retain water. Planting rice here was a thankless task. However, when the rice in the "Rice Cultivation Experimental Farm" was about to be harvested in August, this perception quickly changed after the surrounding farmers visited. After visiting the North Fei River Rice Cultivation Experimental Farm, the farmers' representatives from Fuyang and Su County all expressed that they must grow some rice after returning and do a good job in publicizing the promotion of rice cultivation. The newspaper also published seven photos to match this report, which further increased its persuasiveness.

        The Anhui Daily also published a short commentary entitled "Successful Experiment, Good Start!" to match this report. The commentary pointed out that there are many benefits to converting low-lying dry land into paddy fields. It can not only make crops adapt to the environment where waterlogging often occurs and ensure a better harvest but also store a large amount of water and reduce runoff, which is also very helpful for completely eliminating the Huai River flood disaster.

    The result of turning low-lying land into paddy fields will bring great happiness to the farmers in northern Anhui. In the near future, the low-lying areas along the banks of the North Fei River will no longer be areas with poor harvests every year but will be places where rice flowers fragrance for hundreds of miles.

### 为了共同的目的

    为了共同的目的
    在“曙光照耀着莫斯科”一剧中，农业城集体农庄耕作组长阿·西·里灼夫曾向莫斯科维奇卡纺织厂的先进工人桑妮亚提出实行联系制度，使得“每个在这个联系制度里工作的人，都认识他自己工作的重要性，而且都知道生产最好的最美丽的产品”。在我们这里，在太原造纸厂和山西省百货公司之间，我们看到了由于初步实行一种产销联系制度而获得良好效果的例子。山西日报向读者介绍了这种联系制度，并给予它很高的评价。
    据山西日报九月九日报道，太原造纸厂一九五二年的产品因质量低劣，不易推销，绝大多数的产品都积压下来。其结果，不仅使得该厂生产面临着严重的困难，连工资也不能按时发放；而且影响了销售该厂纸张的山西省百货公司经济核算制度的实行。据太原百货批发站计算，该站积压的太原造纸厂纸张所值金额，比核定的全部商品资金还大一倍多。但是由于今年该厂积极提高产品质量，目前已完全改变了这种情况。该厂一九五三年的新产品在市场上享有很高的信誉，已经成了供不应求的快货。如七月份在太原市的销售额就比新产品上市前的三月份大三倍多。汉口、济南、徐州等地的百货批发站和一些工厂用户纷纷来信要求订购该厂纸张。中央对外贸易部还把太原打字纸选为参加展览的标准产品。
    太原造纸厂的产品质量何以能得到迅速而显著的提高？山西日报在报道中指出，该厂和山西省百货公司建立的产销联系制度在这方面发挥了很大的作用。当该厂劣等产品大量积压的时候，产方和销方都急迫地要求解决这个问题，因此先后召开了两次产销联席会议。在会议上，百货公司根据消费者的需要和要求，提出了改进纸张质量的意见；太原造纸厂的领导干部虚心地接受了这些意见，深切地感到“质量是纸厂的第一生命”，并将这些意见传达给职工群众，后来又将用户的批评信念给工人听。消费者的批评和意见，对于该厂全体职工是一种现实而生动的教育。例如女工王秀英就沉痛地说：“咱成天价钻在车间里劳动，生产出来的却是不受人欢迎的坏东西！”大家认识到生产是为消费者服务后，便以主人翁的自觉态度，为提高质量而奋斗。山西日报通过备料车间工友主动改进选料和劳动模范侯效贤苦心寻找影响产品质量的原因等生动事例，介绍了该厂职工群众为提高质量而动脑筋，想办法，积极提出合理化建议和推广先进经验的情况。经过全厂职工几个月的不断努力不断改进，终于大大减少了纸张的黑点，提高了纸张的白度、紧度、匀度、抗水度……，使得该厂出品由不受消费者欢迎一变而为大受消费者欢迎。
    太原造纸厂与山西省百货公司间的产销联系制度，不仅帮助造纸厂职工树立起对产品质量的高度责任感，而且大大鼓舞了百货公司推销员的工作积极性。山西日报在报道中并没有忽略这一个重要的方面。报道中说，太原造纸厂一九五三年的新产品上市后，百货公司的纸张推销员们简直高兴极了。模范推销员王锦康说：“咱说的话真顶事，三月提了意见，五月造纸厂就生产出呱呱叫的好纸了。”许多推销员在造纸厂工人这种迅速提高产品质量行动的鼓舞下，也想出了许多推销办法，扩大了营业额。模范推销员王锦康并且希望和造纸厂的工人建立经常的联系，向他们及时反映消费者的意见。为了这个目的，王锦康写了一封信给太原造纸厂的劳动模范侯效贤，并得到侯效贤的复信。在信中双方互相报告自己的推销和生产情况，并表示要使这种联系经常化，以相互鼓励相互推动，为更好地满足人民的需要这一共同的目的而努力。这是一种先进的倡议，山西日报支持了他们的倡议，显著地发表了他们的通信，并刊出了他们的照片。
    自然，太原造纸厂和山西省百货公司间的联系制度，还仅仅是一个萌芽，还没有有意识地形成为经常性的制度。但是山西日报对于这种萌芽状态的新鲜事物给予了很大的注意，并发表了时评，在时评中阐明了这种产销联系制度的经济意义和政治意义，指出在国营工业部门和国营贸易部门之间建立一种产销联系制度，对于提高工业品质量，满足广大消费者日益增长的物质要求，对于进一步密切城乡关系，巩固工农联盟，都将有一定的作用。山西日报并且根据太原造纸厂和山西省百货公司的实践，提出了这种产销联系制度的主要内容，即一方面，双方领导上建立定期联系制度，通过开会、通信等方式相互交换产销情况，根据消费者的意见与工业生产情况，签订与修订产销合同，以促进双方业务的发展；另一方面，发动产销双方的先进工作者直接联系，通过通信、座谈、参观，相互提意见、相互鼓励，共同做好生产、推销工作。至于推广这一制度，山西日报指出可根据工业部门与贸易部门的工作需要，先行重点试办，然后再逐步推广；这是正确的。
  变洼地为稻田
    安徽日报在九月十五日以一、二版的大部地位，比较集中地刊登了淮河以北低洼地区改种水稻的报道。安徽省淮北很多低洼地区，农民从来不种水稻，习惯于种高粱、?豆、芝麻等作物。低洼地区经常发生内涝，有时甚至棵粒不收，因而不适于种植这些杂粮作物。为了变水害为水利，今春治淮委员会结合排涝灌溉工程，选择了土壤、地形均有代表性的徐家港，开始试种水稻。治淮委员会农田水利处工作组，也在怀远县鲍集区、新马桥区的崔北平、宋在义两个互助组作了典型试验。现在已证明改种水稻的结果，收获量要比种植杂粮多一倍。如该报在“北淝河下游徐家港稻作试验场，旱地改种水稻获得丰收”的报道中所说的：北淝河稻作试验场，今年种了四十九亩水稻，按照已割的四十一亩多早稻和中稻计算，平均每亩收五百斤稻
  （风干扬净），据当地农民说，这可抵两季黄豆。改种水稻的结果，不仅教育农民认识了种植水稻比种植杂粮的收获量要多，而且扭转了农民对“漏风土”不能种植水稻的认识。该报在“北淝河徐家港稻作试验场试种水稻成功的初步经验”、“从怀疑到相信”和“阜阳、宿县两专区农民代表，参观北淝河稻作试验场”的报道中，就曾具体地描绘了农民的这种转变。例如北淝河“稻作试验场”刚建立时，附近一带村庄的农民，总认为徐家港年年有水灾，土又是“漏风土”，存不住水，在这里种水稻，是吃力不讨好。可是，到八月“稻作试验场”的稻子快要收割时，附近农民参观后，这种认识便很快转变了。阜阳、宿县两专区农民代表，参观北淝河稻作试验场后，更纷纷表示，回去以后一定要种些水稻，做好推广种植水稻的宣传工作。该报配合这一报道，还刊出了七幅照片，这就更增加它的说服力。
        安徽日报配合这一报道，还发表了题为“成功的试验，良好的开端！”的短评。短评中指出，将低洼的旱地改成水田的好处很多，它不但可以使作物适应经常发生内涝的环境，保证有较好的收成，而且可以大量蓄水，减少径流，对彻底消除淮河水灾也是极有帮助的。
    变洼地为稻田的结果，将给淮北农民带来很大的幸福。不久的将来，沿北淝河两岸低洼地区，将不再是年年歉收，而是平畴百里稻花香的地方了。
