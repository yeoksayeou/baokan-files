    Old Boatman Wang Guiyun Actively Rescues Disaster-Stricken Peasants
    Reader Gan Yugui writes: Wang Guiyun of Qiujiatun, Ninth District, Yongji County, Jilin Province, is an old boatman who has been ferrying boats for more than twenty years. In late August of this year, there was heavy rain in the area, and the water level of the Chalu River, not far behind Wang Guiyun's house, rose sharply. One day, just as it was getting light, Wang Guiyun got up and went outside and saw that the river water had reached not far from the gate. He rushed to pull his small boat, but the boat had already been washed away by the water. He was very anxious, and without even telling his wife, he rolled up his trouser legs and went downstream along the riverbank to find the boat.
    When he found his small boat near Hulutou Village, about half a kilometer from his home, the water was still rising, and the water depth on the flat ground was already three or four feet. Thinking about the safety of his family, he rushed to row the boat back. At this moment, he suddenly heard cries for help from behind him. He thought: Hulutou Village must have been flooded. He hesitated for a moment and finally decided not to go home first, but immediately turned the boat around and rowed towards Hulutou Village, which was submerged by the flood.
    In the vast expanse of water, he found a person floating on the water holding a piece of wood, in critical condition. He quickly caught up and rescued the person onto the boat, transferring them to a safe area.
    The sun had risen more than a pole's height, it was time for breakfast, and the flood had already rushed into Wang Guiyun's yard. Wang Guiyun's wife did not see him come home and rushed around to inquire about him. But at that time, Wang Guiyun was anxious to save people and did not think about his own home at all. He spent two days and one night on the small boat, finally rescuing more than thirty people from Hulutou Village and a lot of grain and utensils. Afterwards, someone asked him: "You left your own home to rescue others, how could you not worry?" He said: "In New China, if my children and wife are in danger, someone will also save them."

    老船工王贵云积极抢救受灾农民
    读者甘雨贵来信：吉林省永吉县第九区邱家屯王贵云是一个摆了二十多年渡船的老船工。今年八月下旬，当地下大雨，王贵云家后边不远的岔路河水位暴涨。一天，天刚放亮时，王贵云起来到外边一看，发现河水已来到离大门口不远了。他急忙去拉自己的小船；可是船已被水冲走了。他非常着急，没顾得告诉老婆一声，挽起裤腿就沿着河岸到下游去找船。
    当他在离家一里左右的葫芦头屯附近找到自己的小船时，水势正在上涨，平地水深已有三、四尺。他惦记着家里人的安全，就急着划船回去。这时，他猛听得背后传来了呼救声。他想：一定是葫芦头屯被洪水冲了。他犹豫了片刻，终于决定先不回家，马上掉转船头向被洪水淹没的葫芦头屯划过去。
    在一片汪洋的大水里，他发现一个人抱着木头飘浮在水面上，危急万分，就急忙赶上，把那个人救到船上，转移到安全地带。
    太阳上升出一竿子多高了，正是吃早饭的时候，洪水已冲进王贵云家的院子。王贵云的老婆不见他回家，急得跑到各处打听。但那时王贵云却急于救人，一点也没想到自己的家。他在小船上整整两天一夜，终于把葫芦头屯三十多口人和许多粮食、用具抢救了出来。事后有人问他：“你放下自己的家去抢救别人，怎么放心得下呢？”他说：“在新中国，如果我的孩子、老婆遭到了危险，同样也会有人救她们的。”
