    Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government
    Actively Prepares for Next Year's Capital Construction

    The Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government is stepping up preparations for capital construction in 1954. Based on this year's capital construction situation, the ministry believes that the quality of preparation is of utmost importance for fulfilling the 1954 capital construction plan. Therefore, in order to prepare the 1954 capital construction plan well, the ministry organized more than 30 technical personnel and others from various bureaus and key construction units in late May to start compiling the 1954 capital construction project budget quota (the project budget quota is the main accounting basis for determining the annual engineering investment amount and the materials and labor required). As of now, all project budget quotas, totaling 17 chapters, have been completed, one month ahead of 1953. The types of quotas have increased significantly compared to last year, and the content is more detailed. The early completion of this work not only facilitates the preparation of plans but also allows construction and installation enterprises to consider and prepare labor, tools, materials, construction machinery, and construction subsidiary enterprises as early as possible. As for the 1954 project construction quota, it is currently under investigation and materials are being collected. Secondly, the ministry has formulated a general table for the annual capital construction plan bureau based on the forms issued by the State Planning Commission, and the form for factories and mines will also be issued soon. The forms for relevant equipment, finance, construction, and installation enterprises are also being drafted. Third, the ministry is starting to organize various factories and mines to prepare plans and is organizing a balance in design, equipment, materials, labor, and finance. In terms of approach, this year the ministry is issuing control figures from top to bottom, layer by layer, and has decided to adopt a method of regional concentration, with factories and mines doing the work first, reporting upwards level by level for review and summary. In the various balances, special attention will be paid to the balance in the arrangement of construction progress. To strengthen the leadership of this work, the ministry has formed a central group. In the process of preparing and reviewing plans, it has been decided to pay attention to tapping potential strengths and grasping the progress of key projects while opposing "blind advancement."

    In terms of the deployment of construction forces, the ministry will start preparing to set up additional construction organizations and train a large number of installation and special technical workers according to engineering needs. The ministry has now determined the contracting enterprises for all engineering tasks next year and will distribute the tasks before the end of September. Among them, the engineering company responsible for the construction of important new factories has sent a group of cadres to Anshan Iron and Steel to learn construction experience. Secondly, the ministry is preparing to formulate a plan for winter training of workers. Under the principle of not disrupting the original grassroots organizations, no less than 60% of the trainees will be trained, and the compilation of winter training materials has begun. In addition, the ministry is preparing to establish a capital construction management cadre school to concentrate on the rotating training of middle-level cadres in capital construction. This school will open in January next year, with a planned training of 300 people per class, with a duration of four months. Teaching plans are currently being drafted and teaching materials are being compiled.

    In terms of preparing for equipment orders, the ministry organized more than 60 people to carry out this work from May this year, and by the end of July, all foreign general equipment orders had been submitted. The draft domestic equipment orders are being reviewed and are expected to be submitted in mid-October. Currently, the bureaus are considering the overall equipment balance.

    In terms of construction preparation, the ministry is currently carrying out the compilation of construction organization design for several key projects next year. The construction organization design fully considers the construction of subsidiary factories for capital construction in order to improve engineering quality and accelerate engineering progress. The design of these subsidiary factories has begun. Preparations have also begun for bulk materials, which are planned to be transported to the site before winter according to the construction organization design, in order to start construction early after the thaw next year. In addition, in order to strengthen the management of construction enterprises, various existing management systems are being revised. In order to strengthen the construction plan management of construction and installation enterprises, the method of construction organization design and the implementation rules for the planning work of construction and installation enterprises are being formulated.

    In terms of design work, the design tasks of the design companies under the ministry for 1953 were completed at the end of July. As early as mid-July, the ministry convened a meeting of the directors of the design departments of various bureaus and the managers of various design companies to arrange the compilation of the 1954 design plan. Currently, the bureaus have arranged the design progress according to the design strength and tasks. The design tasks that have been determined are being compiled into planned task books. Recently, the ministry held a design budget quota meeting to revise the design quota for 1953 and add new quotas. In order to provide the necessary information for foreign design in a timely manner, a surveying and mapping meeting was recently held to adjust the surveying and mapping forces. In response to the weak links in the design work, the ministry held an economic engineer training class so that special personnel would be responsible for considering whether it is economically reasonable in the selection of factory sites, preliminary design, and technical design. In addition, construction organization design training classes, as well as training classes for personnel in water supply and drainage, heating, heating, and ventilation design were held. While preparing plans and cultivating forces, the ministry attached great importance to improving the ideological level of design personnel. As early as late July, the ministry convened a meeting of design cadres to summarize the achievements of the design personnel in carrying out studies this year, focusing on criticizing bourgeois design ideas and putting forward the clear goal of establishing socialist design ideas. Currently, the design units are studying and discussing documents, and will carry out criticism and self-criticism from the summary of key projects designed in 1953, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and improve design ideas.

    In terms of geological work, the ministry is compiling the 1954 geological exploration work plan and carrying out the balance of labor, equipment, materials, and finance. In response to the weak links in geological exploration work, the geological exploration departments under the ministry are preparing to establish a specialized testing and appraisal institution, striving to undertake most of the testing and appraisal work themselves next year. In order to train testing personnel, two training classes are being prepared in Harbin and Kunming. Preparations are also being made to train a group of management cadres for geological exploration. This winter, workers will be rectified and trained in Northeast China, North China, and Northwest China. Accepting this year's experience and lessons in exploration and construction, the ministry is stepping up preparations for next year's exploration and construction, such as exploration design, transportation roads, pipes, water and electricity equipment, etc., striving to make preparations as early as possible to facilitate early construction and prevent confusion during construction. In order to strengthen geological exploration work and do a good job in next year's preparations, the ministry recently sent a working group headed by the deputy director of the Geological Bureau to go deep into key work locations to inspect the work.

    中央人民政府重工业部
    积极准备明年基本建设
    中央重工业部正加紧进行一九五四年度基本建设的准备工作。该部根据今年基本建设情况，认为准备工作的好坏，对于完成一九五四年度基本建设计划有着极大关系。因此，该部为编好明年基本建设计划，早在今年五月下旬即组织各局及重点建设单位的技术人员等三十余人，着手编制一九五四年基本建设工程概算定额（工程概算定额是确定全年工程投资数量和需用材料、劳动力的主要核算基础）。到目前为止，全部工程概算定额计十七章已全部编制完毕，比一九五三年提前了一个月。定额种类比去年增加许多，内容更加细致。这一工作提早完成，不但便于编制计划，而且可供建筑安装企业及早考虑和准备劳动力、工具、材料、施工机械以及建设附属企业。至于一九五四年工程施工定额正在调查和搜集材料中。其次，该部已根据国家计划委员会颁发的表格制定了基本建设年度计划局用总表，厂矿企业用表也将于最近颁发，有关设备、财务、建筑安装企业的表格亦正在拟定中。第三，该部正着手组织各厂矿编制计划，并在设计、设备、材料、劳动力及财务等方面组织平衡。在作法上，今年该部由上而下层层颁发控制数字，决定采用地区集中的办法，厂矿先做，逐级上报审核汇总。在各项平衡中将特别注意施工进度排列上的平衡。为加强这一工作的领导，该部已组成中心组。在编制与审核计划过程中，决定在反对“盲目冒进”的同时，注意挖掘潜在力量，抓紧重点工程的进度。
    在施工力量的部署方面，该部根据工程需要将着手筹备增设施工机构，大批培养安装和特殊技术工人。现在该部已将明年全部工程任务确定了承包企业，将在九月底以前把任务分配出去。其中担任重要新厂建设的工程公司已派出一批干部去鞍钢学习施工经验。其次，该部正着手编制冬季训练工人的计划，在不打乱原来基层组织的原则下，受训人员将不少于百分之六十，并已开始编著冬训教材。另外，该部正筹办一个基本建设管理干部学校，集中基本建设中层干部轮流训练。这个学校将在明年一月开学，预定每期训练三百人，时间为四个月。现正草拟教学计划，编制教材。
    在设备定货的准备工作方面，该部从今年五月开始即组织六十余人进行此项工作，到七月底已将国外的一般设备订货全部提出。国内设备订货草案正在审核，预计十月中旬可以提出。目前各局正考虑整个设备的平衡问题。
    在施工准备工作方面，目前该部已为明年的几个重点工程的施工组织设计进行编制工作。在施工组织设计中充分考虑了基本建设的附属工厂的建设问题，以便提高工程质量，加速工程进度。这些附属工厂已开始进行设计。并已着手筹备大宗材料，准备在冬前按施工组织设计运抵现场，以备明年解冻后提前开工。此外，为加强施工企业管理，正着手修订现有的各种管理制度。为加强建筑安装企业的施工计划管理，正制订施工组织设计办法和建筑安装企业计划工作实施细则。
    在设计工作方面，该部所属各设计公司一九五三年度设计任务已于七月底完成。早在七月中旬该部即召集各局设计处处长、各设计公司经理开会，布置了一九五四年设计计划的编制工作，目前各局已根据设计力量与任务编排了设计进度。已经确定了的设计任务，正编制计划任务书。最近该部召开了设计预算定额会议，修改一九五三年度的设计定额，增加新的定额。为及时地供给国外设计所需要的资料，最近又召开了勘测会议，调整了勘测力量。针对设计工作中的薄弱环节，该部举办了经济工程师训练班，以便在选择厂址、初步设计、技术设计等项工作中，有专人负责考虑是否经济合理。此外还举办了施工组织设计训练班，以及上下水道、热力、采暖、通风设计人员训练班。与编制计划、培养力量的同时，该部极大地重视了提高设计人员的思想水平。该部早在七月下旬就召开了设计干部会议，总结了今年设计人员开展学习的成绩，着重地批判了资产阶级设计思想，并提出树立社会主义设计思想的明确目标。目前各设计单位正学习与讨论文件，并将从总结一九五三年设计的重点工程中，开展批评与自我批评，学习苏联先进经验，把设计思想提高一步。
    在地质工作方面，该部正在编制一九五四年地质勘探工作计划，进行劳动力、设备、材料、财务等平衡工作。针对地质勘探工作中的薄弱环节，该部所属地质勘探部门正筹备成立专业化验鉴定机构，争取明年大部化验鉴定工作由自己担负起来。为培养化验人员，正在哈尔滨、昆明筹办两个训练班。并准备训练一批地质勘探的管理干部。今年冬季将在东北、华北、西北进行工人整训。接受今年勘探施工中的经验教训，该部正加紧进行明年勘探施工的准备工作，如勘探设计、运输道路、管材、水电设备等，争取及早作好准备，便于早日施工，防止施工中发生混乱现象。为加强地质勘探工作及做好明年的准备工作，最近该部派出以地质司副司长为首的工作组，深入各重点工作地点检查工作。
