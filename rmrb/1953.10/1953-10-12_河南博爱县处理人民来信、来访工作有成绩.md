After the "Three-Anti" Movement, the People's Supervision Committee and other departments in Boai County, Henan Province, began handling people's letters and visits. After the launch of the struggle against bureaucratism, commandism, and violations of law and discipline this year, the county further strengthened this work and achieved certain results.

From the beginning of handling people's letters to the end of last year, Boai County only received 303 letters from the people (including visits). Starting this year, due to the attention paid by the county's leading organs to the issues raised by the people and their timely and proper resolution, the number of letters from the people has increased. In the first quarter alone, 385 letters from the people were received, exceeding the total number for the entire last year. In the first half of this year, a total of 608 letters from the people were received. As of mid-July, 566 cases had been processed and closed, with replies given to the letter writers, accounting for over 93 percent. According to the Xinxiang Prefectural Supervision Office, very few people from Boai County complained to the Prefectural Office (six cases in half a year), because most of the problems were resolved in the county. In the past six months, county-level agencies have used letters from the people to specifically investigate and deal with more than ten major incidents. For example, Yan Chonggui, a militia cadre in Sujiazuo Village, Fourth District of the county, stole, embezzled, framed others, and extorted money from the masses, but the leadership was long deceived and considered him a good cadre. This spring, the masses exposed his crimes, and the county People's Government sent people to investigate and confirm them. He was sentenced to imprisonment by the judicial organs, which pleased the masses. Through handling such major incidents, the county has promoted democracy, improved the relationship between the Party and the People's Government and the masses, and promoted production. The masses are generally satisfied with the problems that have been handled. Many parties involved wrote letters to the county magistrate or the county People's Supervision Committee to express their gratitude after the incidents were resolved.

The key to the success of the People's Supervision Committee and other agencies in Boai County in handling people's letters lies in the importance attached to it by the county committee and the county People's Government. Originally, in the second half of last year, no department in Boai County had a dedicated person responsible for receiving visiting masses, and no one was in charge of managing people's letters. Although four people's suggestion boxes were set up, two of them received letters that were damaged by wind and rain because no one was responsible. At the end of last year, the Minister of the County Party Committee's Organization Department convened a meeting of relevant departments to arrange the work of handling people's letters. Later, the county magistrate made a report on supervision work and strengthening the handling of people's letters at the county People's Representative Conference. In particular, after the problem of no one being responsible for the people's suggestion boxes was resolved, all departments attached importance to the work of handling people's letters as the leadership attached importance to it.

Secondly, the people's supervision correspondents have played a significant role in contacting the masses and reflecting their opinions, which is also a major reason for the county's success in handling people's letters. Many people are willing to report to the supervision correspondents, whether the problems are big or small. In the past six months, the problems reported by the supervision correspondents accounted for one-third of all the letters from the people, including many major problems. For example, the issue of the new sulfur furnace promoted by the county's native products company, as well as the collective gambling case in Dongwanghe Township, and the problem of bureaucratism in the leadership of state-owned farms were all reported by supervision correspondents. The supervision correspondent Li Fazheng did not forget to promote supervision work while staying in a hotel on the way to visit his mother in Yuanyang County. After listening to the publicity, the people in the hotel reported to him that the deputy director of the People's Supervision Committee of Yuanyang County had shielded cadres' corruption when he was the district chief. Li Fazheng immediately reported this issue to the Yuanyang County People's Government. When Wang Jibin, a cadre of the County People's Supervision Committee, was irresponsible in his work in the countryside, the supervision correspondent reported it to the higher authorities. The supervision correspondents have become a bridge connecting the People's Government and the people in the countryside. They not only reflect the opinions of the masses to the County People's Supervision Committee, but also copy the relevant circulars and letters issued by the County People's Supervision Committee on blackboard newspapers or explain them to the masses orally.

Why can the supervision correspondents in the county maintain such close contact with the masses and play a significant role? First, the County People's Supervision Committee attaches importance to the establishment of the supervision correspondents' work. In mid-October last year, after the county magistrate made a report on supervision work at the County People's Representative Conference, 67 people were selected from more than 200 people's representatives to serve as supervision correspondents. Later, through the County Educational Workers' Representative Conference, mass meetings and Party rectification work were used to elect 104 supervision correspondents in key villages. At present, there are a total of 189 supervision correspondents in the county. Most of these supervision correspondents have close ties with the masses and have prestige among the masses. Second, the leadership of the County People's Supervision Committee over the supervision correspondents is very specific. In December last year, the Committee convened a county-wide conference of supervision correspondents, which resolved some ideological problems of the supervision correspondents and enhanced their awareness of being masters of their own affairs. Since the beginning of this year, the County People's Supervision Committee has issued instructions to the supervision correspondents every time it carries out central work, explaining the policies, guidelines, and work methods related to the central work, and proposing the focus of reflecting the situation. The County People's Supervision Committee has reported the handling of the problems reflected by the supervision correspondents to them one by one, and at the same time, it has circulated commendations for the active and responsible supervision correspondents. The supervision correspondents and the County People's Supervision Committee have maintained close contact. When supervision correspondents go to the county seat for other matters, they often go to the County People's Supervision Committee to talk about their work. When cadres of the County People's Supervision Committee go to the countryside to investigate problems, the supervision correspondents actively assist them and naturally become assistants of the Supervision Committee.

Another experience in handling people's letters in Boai County is that the County People's Supervision Committee is good at actively cooperating with relevant departments to solve problems. The County People's Supervision Committee and relevant agencies such as the County People's Court jointly agreed that the main cadres of each department would work together every Saturday to study the main existing problems in each department and district and township, or to study the handling methods of major incidents. Doing so can improve the speed and quality of handling cases, and also help improve the policy level and ideological level of staff. In addition, through joint office work, the County People's Supervision Committee has also played a supervisory role in the work of handling people's letters in various departments, criticizing or otherwise punishing those who do not attach importance to handling people's letters, and commending those who are responsible and quick in handling people's letters.

Another experience in handling people's letters in Boai County is that it is good at publicly handling major typical events to achieve the purpose of universally educating cadres and educating the masses. The county generally uses enlarged cadre meetings, People's Representative Conferences, or mass rallies to deal with major events, and some also issue circulars. When dealing with the violations of law and discipline by cadres in Shuangmiao Village, a mass rally of hundreds of people was convened to allow the masses to discuss the handling. At the meeting, the masses were in high spirits, confronting each other, and making suggestions. The county has also established some feasible systems for handling general letters from the people.

The People's Supervision Committee of the Central South Administrative Council believes that in addition to adhering to and implementing the existing system, Boai County should further conduct some research work on the handling of people's letters and visits, and comprehensively study cases of similar nature - such as the recent water conservancy disputes, marriage disputes of revolutionary soldiers, etc. - to provide reference for relevant leading organs, so as to take appropriate measures to reduce the occurrence of similar incidents.

### 河南博爱县处理人民来信、来访工作有成绩

    河南博爱县处理人民来信、来访工作有成绩
    “三反”运动后，河南省博爱县人民监察委员会和其他部门开始作处理人民来信、来访的工作；今年开展反官僚主义、反强迫命令和反违法乱纪斗争以后，该县进一步加强了这一工作，并且取得了一定成绩。
    博爱县从开始处理人民来信的工作到去年年底，仅收到人民来信（包括来访，下同）三百零三件。今年起，由于人民群众提出的问题受到该县领导机关的重视并且得到及时妥善的处理，所以人民来信增加了。第一季度便收到人民来信三百八十五件，超过去年全年总数。今年上半年共收到人民来信六百零八件。现已经处理结案并答复了来信人的，据七月中旬统计，共五百六十六件，占百分之九十三强。据新乡专署监察处反映，博爱县群众到专署控告的很少（半年中有六件），就是因为大部分问题在县里解决了。半年来，该县县一级机关通过人民来信，特别检查处理了较重大的事件十多起。该县第四区苏家作村民兵干部阎崇贵，偷盗贪污并嫁祸于人，向群众敲诈勒索等，领导上却长期被蒙蔽，认为他是好干部。今年春，群众揭发了他的罪恶，县人民政府派人检查证实，由司法机关判处徒刑，群众莫不称快。该县通过处理这样一些较重大的事件，发扬了民主，改善了党和人民政府与群众的关系，也推动了生产。所处理过的问题，群众一般都感到满意。不少当事人在事件处理后，写信给县长或县人民监察委员会表示感谢。
    博爱县人民监察委员会和其他机关处理人民来信工作所以取得了成绩，关键就在于县委会和县人民政府领导的重视。本来去年下半年，博爱县各部门都还没有专人负责接待来访群众，对人民来信也没有专人管理。虽然设立了四个人民意见箱，由于无人负责，其中两个箱收到的信件，已被风吹雨打，受到损坏。去年年底县委组织部长召集有关部门开会，布置了处理人民来信工作，以后县长在县各界人民代表会议上，又作了关于监察工作和加强处理人民来信工作的报告，特别从解决了人民意见箱无人负责的问题后，各部门对处理人民来信工作都随着领导的重视而重视起来。
    其次，人民监察通讯员在联系群众，反映群众意见上起了很大作用，也是该县处理人民来信获得成绩的主要原因。许多群众，不论大小问题，他们都乐意向监察通讯员反映。半年来，由监察通讯员反映的问题，占全部人民来信的三分之一，其中包括许多重大问题。如该县土产公司推行新式硫磺炉问题，以及东王贺乡集体赌博案，国营农场领导上的官僚主义问题等，都是由监察通讯员反映的。监察通讯员李法正到原阳县探望母亲，途中住旅店也不忘宣传监察工作。旅店的人听了宣传，向他反映了原阳县人民监察委员会副主任在当地任区长时，曾经包庇干部贪污的情况。李法正立即到原阳县人民政府反映了这一问题。县人民监察委员会干部王继彬在乡下工作不负责任，监察通讯员便向上级作了反映。监察通讯员在乡村中成了人民政府和人民群众联系的一个桥梁，他们不仅把群众的意见反映给县人民监察委员会，同时也把县人民监察委员会发的有关通报、信件抄在黑板报上或口头向群众讲解。
    该县监察通讯员为什么能这样密切地联系群众，并且发挥了很大的作用？第一，县人民监察委员会重视建立监察通讯员的工作。去年十月中旬，县各界人民代表会议上，县长作了关于监察工作的报告后，遂即在二百多个人民代表中推出六十七个人任监察通讯员。以后又通过该县教育工作者代表会议，在重点村通过群众大会和整党工作，选举了一百零四个监察通讯员。现在该县共有一百八十九个监察通讯员。这些监察通讯员大多和群众有着密切的联系，在群众中有威信。第二，县人民监察委员会对监察通讯员的领导很具体。去年十二月，该会曾经召开全县监察通讯员大会，解决了监察通讯员思想上的一些问题。提高了他们当家作主的思想。今年以来，每一次开展中心工作时，县人民监察委员会对监察通讯员都发出指示，说明与中心工作有关的政策、方针和工作方法，并提出反映情况的重点。县人民监察委员会对监察通讯员反映的问题，都一一向他们交代处理情况，同时对积极负责的监察通讯员还通报表扬。监察通讯员和县人民监察委员会一直保持着密切的联系。监察通讯员因其他事到县城时，往往要到县人民监察委员会去谈工作情况；县人民监察委员会的干部下乡调查问题，监察通讯员便积极协助，很自然地成为监察委员会的助手。
    博爱县处理人民来信工作的另一个经验是：县人民监察委员会善于主动地配合有关部门解决问题。该县人民监察委员会和县人民法院等有关机关，共同约定每星期六各部门的主要干部联合办公，研究各部门和各区乡现存的主要问题，或研究重大事件的处理办法等。这样做，可以提高处理案件的速度和质量，也有助于提高工作人员的政策水平和思想水平。另外，通过联合办公，县人民监察委员会对各部门处理人民来信的工作还起了督促的作用，对某些不重视处理人民来信的人员，给以批评或其他处分；对处理人民来信负责迅速的，给以表扬。
    博爱县处理人民来信的工作还有一个经验就是：善于公开处理重大的典型事件，以达到普遍教育干部教育群众的目的。该县对重大事件，一般采用扩大干部会议、人民代表会议或群众大会进行处理，有的还发了通报。处理双庙村干部违法乱纪事件时，即曾经召开了数百人的群众大会，让群众讨论处理。会上，群众情绪很高，当面对证，提意见。对处理一般的人民来信，该县也订立了一些可行的制度。
    中南行政委员会人民监察委员会认为，博爱县处理人民来信、来访的工作，除了应该坚持贯彻已有的制度以外，还应该进一步作些研究工作，把同类性质的案件——如最近的水利纠纷、革命军人婚姻纠纷等——综合研究，提供有关领导机关参考，以便采取适当措施，减少同类事件的发生。
