“Now This Feels Like a Real Family!”
    Tu Chenye
    East of Chenliang Fort in Guizhu County, Guizhou Province, there's a small mountain hollow, and within that hollow lies a village called Xiaowo Village. Although it only has forty-seven households, it's home to people from the Han, Yi, and Miao ethnic groups. Two households belong to the Han ethnicity and were invited as artisans this year to engage in sideline businesses and fire bricks and tiles in the mutual aid group. These two households live on the hillside outside the village and don't often enter the village itself. The Yi and Miao people, despite living together for over a hundred years, harbored certain prejudices against each other due to some past grudges. Over the past three years, under the education of the Communist Party and the People's Government, everyone's awareness has improved, and they have generally lived in peace. However, because the roots of prejudice hadn't been dug out, and the divisions hadn't been completely eliminated, issues involving both ethnic groups would still spark some gossip. Consequently, problems arose during this year's general election.

    Not a "Small Problem"
    In the upper courtyard of Xiaowo Village, there's a rectangular courtyard with a row of tile-roofed houses housing five families (these tile-roofed houses originally belonged to the landlord and have now been distributed to the peasants). Only Wang Ziyi's family is Miao. Wang Ziyi is a liberated poor peasant. He received houses and land in the land reform the year before last, bought livestock last year, and in May of this year, his young wife gave birth to a fair and plump baby. Wang Ziyi felt unspeakable joy.

    According to the local custom, women in postpartum confinement don't need to stay confined for the entire month; after just over twenty days, they can do some light work. That day, Wang Ziyi's wife ate breakfast and, carrying a basket and sickle, prepared to cut some green grass to feed the livestock. Unexpectedly, as she approached the main gate, she saw several Yi women rushing out, holding hands and forming a line. The leading one, named Wei Sufen, blocked her path. An argument immediately ensued between the two sides. Wang Ziyi's wife questioned Wei Sufen about why she wasn't allowed to leave, and the Yi women said in unison, "According to our Yi customs, women in postpartum confinement are not allowed to use the main gate. As you live in this courtyard, you are no exception." Wang Ziyi's wife argued with them for a long time without success, and she had to return home in anger.

    It was mid-May at that time, and the general election work team had already come to the village. Wang Ziyi went to the work team and reported this matter. The work team thought this was a small problem and sent a comrade down to mediate it. After investigating, it was found that the Yi people didn't have a custom of not allowing women in postpartum confinement to use the main gate; this was just an excuse, and there might be other underlying issues. During the mediation, the Yi women refused to concede in the slightest, insisting that this was a custom. The comrade from the work team felt that they couldn't force it and should persuade them slowly. As time dragged on, Wang Ziyi's wife's confinement period ended. The problem was thus left unresolved.

    Not many days later, disputes arose again during the population survey and voter registration.

    On the day of voter registration, a large crowd gathered in front of the voter registration station, including people from various ethnic groups, all happily coming to receive their voter certificates. At this time, an elderly woman in her sixties came with her son to register. The cadre in charge of registration asked her what her name was. Her son answered for her, saying, "Her name is Luo Yadai." Originally, "Yadai" was a Yi word, and there was no way to write it in Chinese characters. The cadre scratched his head and, unable to do anything else, had to find Chinese characters with similar sounds to replace it. Unexpectedly, this caused a stir among the Miao people, and everyone began to whisper to each other. After a while, a Miao youth in his twenties also came to register, saying his name was "Chen Zhaolu." The words "Zhaolu" were also Miao, and there was no way to write them either. The cadre followed the previous example and found two Chinese characters with similar sounds to replace them and issued the voter certificate. This similarly caused a stir among the Yi people.

    The registration of more than forty households was quickly completed, and the masses returned home to production. However, that evening, people from both ethnic groups raised objections. Some Miao people said, "Luo Yadai originally had a name, why didn't her son report the original name? 'Yadai' in Yi means great-grandmother. It's fine if she's the Yi people's great-grandmother, but when we call her name during meetings, are we supposed to call her great-grandmother too? This doesn't make sense." The Yi people also had grievances, saying, "Chen Zhaolu was originally called Chen Juren, why didn't he report his original name? 'Zhaolu' in Miao means great-grandfather. He's so young, are we supposed to call him great-grandfather?" At the time, opinions were divided and the situation became very tense. Clearly, this was caused by the divisions between the ethnic groups.

    From Mutual Distrust to Sincere Treatment
    Events developed quickly, and before the "name" dispute was fully resolved, another incident occurred during the deliberation and discussion of representative candidates.

    The Miao representative, Tang Youde, was a young man of twenty-two or three years old who had served as a militiaman and was very active in the land reform. Among the dozen or so Miao households in Xiaowo Village, he was a significant figure. In the joint nomination by various ethnic groups and people's organizations, he was nominated as the Miao representative. At that time, some Yi people in Xiaowo Village also participated in the nomination and had no objections. However, after these two incidents occurred in succession, the Yi people had objections during the voter group discussions, saying that Tang Youde was young, impatient, and narrow-minded, and he remembered anyone who said something wrong to him. They didn't agree with him being a representative and instead nominated Chen Faguai as the Miao representative. As a result, the Miao people also disagreed with the Yi candidate Chen Xingkai, saying that Chen Xingkai was sluggish and always procrastinated in his work. Tang Jigang, who raised the objection, also cited an example, saying that once he had Chen Xingkai take 100,000 yuan in loan repayments to the bank, but Chen Xingkai had given the money to the women's committee member of Fuguan Village. Later, the bank's comrades came to him again to demand payment, and he asked Chen Xingkai to clear it up, but he hadn't done it after a month or two. Therefore, he concluded that such a person couldn't be a representative and instead nominated Chen Lizhou as the Yi representative. In fact, the course of this matter was as follows: Chen Xingkai had made several trips for this matter, only because he had carelessly given the money to the wrong person, who had misappropriated it. He had told Tang Jigang the details, and Tang Jigang didn't say anything at the time, but now he was bringing up old scores.

    At this critical juncture, the work team, after several days of investigation, had largely figured out the situation. It turned out that:

    Tang Youde's father was called Tang Jiming. During his lifetime, he rented land from the landlord Chen Shundi (Han ethnicity) and made a contract to pay fifteen shi of grain in rent each year. Later, Tang Jiming died. At that time, Tang Youde and his brother were not very old. The landlord said that his family had few people and was afraid that they would not be able to pay the rent in the future. He also claimed that the Yi person Chen Liangzhi wanted to cultivate the land, and took the land back and sublet it to Chen Liangzhi. That year, Tang Youde's family suffered one misfortune after another. The whole family was worried about how they would live after the land was taken away, and the head of the village colluded with the head of the district to force Tang Youde's brother into the army. The removal of the land and the forced conscription caused the Tang family to live a hard life for several years. Therefore, in Tang Youde's heart, the impression was deeply ingrained that the Yi people relied on having more households and specially oppressed the Miao people. After liberation, Tang Youde became a militiaman and had great enthusiasm. In all kinds of work, he could actively take the lead. However, young people always have shortcomings in their work, such as sometimes having a somewhat rigid attitude; if he suffered a little loss, he would think he had been wronged and was being bullied. In addition, the previous "knot" had not been untied, so he inevitably had prejudices in understanding problems. And he had prestige among the Miao people. The work team understood this and decided to focus on educating him.

    Among the Yi people, they also didn't fully understand the meaning of ethnic unity, and there always seemed to be something separating them. For example, during summer nights to cool off, if there were Miao people in the courtyard, the Yi people would not go there much. Last autumn harvest, when organizing mutual aid groups to rush to harvest, they also forgot to invite the Miao people to participate. The work team held several talks with Chen Xingkai and other representative figures. They also invited both sides to hold talks.

    After a day of talks, Tang Youde's mind cleared up. He complained that his brain was so simple and couldn't figure out such a small thing. It turned out that it wasn't Chen Liangzhi who seized the land at the time, but the landlord who was playing tricks inside. The landlord told Chen Liangzhi, "The Tang family has died, and they're not farming the land anymore. I'll rent it to you, the Tang family pays 17.5 shi of rent each year, I'll give you a discount of 0.5 shi, just 17 shi will do." Chen Liangzhi thought, since their family isn't farming it anymore, I'll take it over. With one turn of the hand, the landlord made two shi of rent and put the blame on others. Besides, forcing people into the army, wasn't it just forcing Miao people? The Yi people were also forced in the same way. Under the enlightenment and help of the work team, the people of both ethnic groups fully saw through the essence of the problem: It was the Kuomintang reactionaries who were forcing people into the army, not any one ethnic group; the prejudices between each other were also provoked by the landlord. Everyone's minds were suddenly enlightened, and they began to treat each other with sincerity.

    The Feelings Between the Two Ethnic Groups Harmonized
    Next, the work team convened a small consultative meeting, inviting the elders, village cadres, and representative figures from both sides to participate. First, Tang Youde reviewed his own erroneous understanding, and also reviewed some shortcomings in his work. Then Chen Xingkai also made a review, and told everyone the conclusions they had reached. Everyone thought, that's right, things were indeed like this, so they could all understand each other. At the meeting, not only did they agree to both sides' nominations, but they also resolved the aforementioned disputes.

    As a result, everyone spoke enthusiastically, and the meeting was filled with an atmosphere of friendship and unity. One Yi woman said, "In the past, the landlord provoked discord between your two families. During the land reform, your two families divided that piece of land (referring to the land Tang Youde and Chen Liangzhi jointly received from the landlord Chen Shundi). What's there to be angry about? We should thank Chairman Mao and unite like a family in the future." These words were deeply engraved in everyone's hearts, and everyone nodded in agreement.

    The people who participated in the consultative meeting went back and promoted it to their neighbors, and the masses were very excited. In the deliberation and discussion of the voter groups, the representative candidates of the Miao and Yi ethnic groups were smoothly passed. The feelings between the ethnic groups became very harmonious, and they became closer and had more frequent interactions. For example, in the past, even if the Yi people lacked a bowl, they would rather take a few more steps to borrow from a member of their own ethnicity than borrow from the Miao family next door. Now, it's different. When the Yi people dry grain, if it rains, the Miao family also helps to rush the harvest, just like a family.

    On June 22nd, as soon as it dawned, people from both ethnic groups called each other to get up, gathered their teams, and went to Dawo Village to participate in the election meeting. That day, the women all wore floral cloth clothes and embroidered waistbands; the men were also in new clothes from top to bottom, glowing with joy, talking and laughing. Some people in the team were playing the suona and pulling the huqin, even more lively than celebrating a festival.

    At the meeting place, two young Yi girls had already boiled hot tea and were diligently entertaining the Miao people. When Tang Youde and Chen Xingkai were elected, everyone raised their hands.

    Tang Youde spoke at the meeting, expressing that he would strengthen ethnic unity. After the meeting, on the way home, Tang Youde and Chen Xingkai talked and walked, even more intimate than real brothers. People of all ethnic groups happily said, "Now this feels like a real family!"

    “这才真正像一家人呀！”
    涂尘野
    贵州省贵筑县陈亮堡东边，有个小山窝，山窝里有个村庄叫小窝寨。这里虽然只有四十七户人家，却有汉、彝、苗三族人民。两户属汉族，是在今年互助组里搞副业、开窑烧砖瓦时请来的工匠。这两户住在寨外山坡上，没事不大进寨。彝、苗两族人民，虽同居了百余年，却因为以前留下的一些嫌隙，彼此之间存有某些成见。三年来，在共产党和人民政府教育下，大家的觉悟都有所提高，一向相安无事。可是由于成见的根子没有挖出来，隔阂没有完全消除，一接触到牵涉两族间的问题，又不免有些闲言闲语，所以在今年普选当中，又发生了问题。
    不是“小问题”
    小窝寨上院，有一个长方形的大院落，一排瓦房里住了五家人家（这瓦房原本是地主的，现在已分给农民）。其中只王子意一家是苗族。王子意是翻身的贫农。前年分得房屋田地，去年买了牲口，今年五月间，他年轻的妻子又生了个又白又胖的娃娃。王子意心中有说不出的欢喜。
    照那里的习惯，坐月子的妇女不用满月，二十多天后，便可做一些轻巧活。那天，王子意的妻子吃了早饭，背着箩筐、镰刀，预备去割点青草喂牲口；不料刚走近大门，便见几个彝族妇女冲出来，她们手拉手排成一条线。为首的一个叫韦素芬，她挡住对方的去路。当下双方便争吵起来。王子意妻子质问韦素芬为什么不让她走，那几个彝族妇女异口同声地说：“按照我们彝族的风俗习惯，月子婆不准走大门，你住在这个院子也不能例外。”王子意的妻子和她们争吵了好半天，毫无结果，她只好气忿忿地回去了。
    那时是五月中旬，普选工作组已下到村子里。王子意就到工作组那里，报告了这件事情。工作组以为这是小问题，就派了个同志下去，要他调解一下就算了。下去一了解，彝族并没有月子婆不准走大门的习惯，这只是藉口而已，其中可能还有其他问题。而在调解中，那几个彝族妇女也丝毫不肯让步，硬说这是风俗习惯。工作组的同志认为，这不能强迫，慢慢劝说吧。时间一拖，王子意妻子的月子已经满了。这个问题也就这样不了了之。
    没有几天，在人口调查和选民登记中，纠纷又发生了。
    进行选民登记的那天，在选民登记站前，围了一大群人，各族人民都有，大家都欢天喜地的来领选民证。这时，一个六十多岁的老太婆陪着儿子来登记了。负责登记工作的干部问她叫什么名字。她儿子代答道：“叫罗雅带。”本来，“雅带”是彝语，汉字没法写。那个干部抓了一下头皮，没法，只好找个音近似的汉字来代替。不料这一下却在苗族群众中引起了波动，大家纷纷低声地议论开了。片刻，有个二十多岁的苗族青年也来登记，说叫“陈照禄”。“照禄”两个字是苗语，也没法写，那个干部就援引上例，也找了两个音近似的汉字来代替，把选民证发了。这一来同样在彝族群众中引起波动。
    四十多户人家，很快就登记完毕，群众也各自回家生产。但在当天晚上，两族人民提出意见了。苗族中有人说：“罗雅带原来有名字，她儿子为什么不报原来的名字呢？‘雅带’彝语是老祖太的意思，她做彝族的老祖太也还罢了，但是开会时要喊名字，难道也叫我们苗族喊她做老祖太？这不合道理。”彝族中同样也有人不平，说：“陈照禄原来叫陈居仁，他为什么不报原来的名字呢？‘照禄’苗语是老祖公。他年纪轻轻，难道还要我们去叫他老祖公？”当时意见纷纷，闹得很僵。很明显，这是由民族之间的隔阂所引起的。
    从互不信任到以诚相待
    事件发展得很快，“名字”纠纷还没完全解决，在酝酿讨论代表候选人中又出了事情。
    苗族代表唐有德，是个二十二、三岁的青年小伙子，当过民兵，在土地改革中工作也很积极。在小窝寨十多户苗族当中，他算个人物。在各民族各人民团体联合提名中，他被提为苗族代表。当时，小窝寨彝族中也有人参加提名，没有什么意见。可是接连发生这两件事后，在选民小组讨论中，彝族却有意见了，说唐有德年青，性子急躁，气量又小，谁说错了一句话他都记在心里，不同意他当代表，并代苗族提陈发贵当代表。这样一来，苗族也不同意彝族的代表候选人陈兴开了，说陈兴开疲，办事总是拖拖拉拉的。提意见的唐继纲还举了个例子，说是某次他把还给银行的拾万元贷款，交陈兴开带去偿还，陈兴开却把钱交给了付官村的妇女委员。后来，银行的工作同志又来向他要，叫陈兴开去清理，可是他拖了一两个月还没办好。因此，就下了个结论，说这样的人不能当代表，也代替彝族提陈礼州当代表。其实，这件事情的经过是这样的：陈兴开为了这件事曾跑了好几趟，只为他一时不小心，把款子交错了人，被人家挪用了。他曾把详细情形告诉过唐继纲，当时唐继纲没说什么，现在却翻起旧账来了。
    正在这紧要关头，工作组经过几天的了解，大体上已把情况摸清楚，原来事情是这样的：
    唐有德的父亲叫唐继明。生前租种了地主陈顺弟（汉族）的田，立了契约每年交租十五石谷子。后来唐继明死了。当时，唐有德和他哥哥的年纪都不大。地主便说他家人手少，怕以后交不起租。又推说彝族人陈亮之要种，把田抽回去转佃给陈亮之了。这年唐有德家是祸不单行，全家人正在发愁田抽走了怎么过日子，甲长又串通保长，把唐有德的哥哥拉去当兵。抽田又被拉兵，唐家以后着实过了几年苦日子。因此在唐有德心中，就深深地留下个印象，以为彝族仗着户多，专门压迫苗族。解放后，唐有德当了民兵，劲头挺大。在各项工作中，他都能积极带头。可是，年青人办事总有缺点，例如有时态度不免生硬了点；吃一点亏，就认为受了屈，又受人家欺侮了。加之，以前那个“结”没有解开，所以在理解问题上就不免带有成见。而他在苗族中有威信。工作组了解了这点，便决定着重对他进行教育。
    在彝族中，也并不完全了解民族团结的意义，彼此间总好像隔着层什么似的。比方说，夏夜歇凉，院子里有苗族人，彝族人就不大去。去年秋收，组织互助组抢收，也忘了约苗族人参加。工作组就和陈兴开及其他几个有代表性的人物进行了几次谈话。又约他们双方进行了会谈。
    经过一天的会谈，唐有德的心豁亮了。他埋怨自己的脑筋竟那样简单，这么点事都想不透。原来当时不是陈亮之夺佃，而是地主在里头耍了诡计。地主对陈亮之说：“唐家死了人，不种田了，我租给你种吧，唐家每年交租十七石五，我让你五斗，只要十七石算了。”陈亮之一想，既然他家不种了，我就接下来?。地主一转手，干得了两石租子，还把罪名加在别人身上。再说拉兵吧，又何尝是光拉苗族人呢？彝族人还不是一样被拉。在工作组的启发和帮助下，两族人民才完全看透了问题的本质：拉兵的是国民党反动派，不是那一族；彼此之间的成见，也是地主从中挑拨起来的。大家的心都豁然开朗，开始以诚相待。
    两族之间的感情融洽起来了
    接着，工作组召开了一个小型的协商会议，邀集双方的父老、村干部，以及有代表性的人物参加。首先，唐有德检讨了自己的错误认识，同时又检讨了自己工作中的一些缺点。随即陈兴开也作了检讨，并把他们得出的结论讲给大家听。大家一想，不错哇，事情确实是这样的，因此都能够互相谅解。在会上不但同意双方的提名，并且连带把前述的纠纷也解决了。
    于是，大家都踊跃发言，会上充满了友好团结的气氛。有一个彝族妇女说：“以前地主从中挑拨你两家不和，土地改革中，你们两家分了那块田
    （指唐有德和陈亮之共同分得地主陈顺弟的田）还有什么气呢？我们应该感谢毛主席，今后要团结得像一家人才对。”这些话一字一句都深深刻在大家心坎上，人人都点头赞成。
    参加协商会议的人，回去向邻居一宣传，群众都很兴奋。在选民小组酝酿讨论中，顺利地通过了苗、彝两族的代表候选人。民族之间的感情变得很融洽，彼此更亲密了，相互来往也更频繁了。举个例说，以前彝族人即使缺一个碗，宁肯多走几步，到本族的人家去借，而不肯就近到隔壁的苗族人家那里去借。现在，就不同了。彝族人晒谷子，逢到天雨，苗家也去帮着抢收，像一家人一样。
    六月二十二日，天刚亮，两族人民就互相呼唤着起床，集队前往大窝寨，参加选举大会。那天，妇女们都穿上花布衣裳，系着绣花腰带；男子汉也上下一身新，容光焕发，有说有笑。队伍中还有人吹着唢呐，拉着胡琴，真比过节还热闹。
    在会场上，早有两个年轻的彝族姑娘，烧了热茶水，殷勤招待苗族人民。当选举唐有德和陈兴开时，大家都举了手。
    会上唐有德讲了话，表示要加强民族团结。散会后在回家的路上，唐有德和陈兴开两人边走边谈，比亲兄弟还亲热。各族人民都高兴地说：“这才真正像一家人呀！”
