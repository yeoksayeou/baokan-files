The construction of the project to divert water from the Yellow River to irrigate and aid the Wei River has enabled more than 700,000 mu of water-deficient farmland in six counties, including Xinxiang and Huojia, on both sides of the Beijing-Hankou Railway in Henan Province to receive timely irrigation, and the 900-kilometer Wei River waterway from Xinxiang to Tianjin has been opened.

The project to divert water from the Yellow River to irrigate and aid the Wei River involves opening a main canal near the Beijing-Hankou Railway bridge on the north bank of the Yellow River, diverting a portion of the Yellow River water into the Wei River near Xinxiang. Main canals and branch canals are then dug on both sides of the main canal to divert water to irrigate the vast farmland in Huojia, Xinxiang, Wuzhi, Yuanyang, Ji County, and Yanjin counties that do not receive timely rainfall. Due to the poor natural conditions of the Yellow River itself, coupled with the Kuomintang reactionary rule's failure to repair dikes and destruction of forests, this area frequently suffered from floods and droughts, making it impossible for farmers to live, and a large number fled to other places to escape famine. After liberation, under Chairman Mao's principle of giving equal importance to harnessing and eliminating harm in controlling the Yellow River, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission proposed a plan for the project to divert water from the Yellow River to irrigate and aid the Wei River in the winter of 1949. After full preparation, the project officially started in March 1951, constructing main projects such as the main canal, the West Main Canal, the East First Main Canal, as well as sluice gates and bridges. The first phase of the project was completed ahead of schedule at the end of December. In April 1952, water was officially released, and in addition to aiding the Wei River, the East One and West One irrigation areas also began irrigation. The second phase, including the sedimentation area and the East Three, East Two, Xinci, and Xiaoji irrigation area projects, began in June 1952 and was completed in December. The third phase involved the reinforcement and renovation of some projects and the construction of buildings in the sedimentation area, which began in February of this year and was completed in August. The entire irrigation area project was basically completed by this point. A total of 12,176 canals at all levels were completed, with a total length of 5,726 kilometers, including four main canals and fourteen branch canals, totaling 263 kilometers in length, and drainage canals at all levels totaling more than 2,100 kilometers in length. The total earthwork was approximately 16 million cubic meters. A total of 1,499 various buildings were completed, including water intake gates, diversion gates, control gates, waterfalls, aqueducts, inverted siphons, bridges, and sluice gates, using 130,700 metric tons of materials. The construction alone mobilized 244,400 man-days of labor.

The project to divert water from the Yellow River to irrigate and aid the Wei River has achieved tremendous benefits. During the sowing of major autumn crops in June 1952, northern Henan Province experienced a drought, and there was no rainfall from July to September when crops urgently needed water. However, due to the completion of the first phase of the project to divert water from the Yellow River, timely irrigation of 284,000 mu of farmland in the East One and West One irrigation areas was ensured. Irrigated cotton, corn, and millet yielded one to four or five times more per mu than non-irrigated crops, with a total increased output value of more than 57 billion yuan. Due to sufficient soil moisture from autumn irrigation that year, wheat was sown in a timely manner. This spring, when wheat turned green, irrigation was carried out in all areas lacking moisture, resulting in sufficient moisture, high soil temperatures, vigorous wheat seedlings, and strong disaster resistance. Although there was widespread frost in April, the wheat seedlings in the irrigation area suffered very little damage, and quickly recovered to their original state after timely irrigation and rescue. Irrigation was also carried out during wheat grain filling. Therefore, this year, wheat that has been irrigated generally yields 60 to 70 jin more per mu than in normal years. More than 200 mu in the East One irrigation area yielded as much as 300 to 400 jin. This year, after the headworks were reinforced, the water intake at the headworks gate increased from 40 cubic meters per second to 50 cubic meters per second, with 23 cubic meters per second aiding the Wei River and 27 cubic meters per second for irrigation. The irrigation area was expanded from the original planned 360,000 mu to 720,000 mu. The Wei River previously had insufficient water, and ordinary wooden boats could only load 50% to 70% of their capacity. Especially in the Xinxiang to Linqing section, the riverbed was shallow and narrow, and navigation was suspended during the dry season. Since the diversion of the Yellow River, the smooth navigation of the Wei River has been ensured, and wooden boats of 100 tons can be fully loaded. In 1952, the ton-kilometers of freight transport on the Wei River completed were approximately 162% of those in 1951, increasing freight revenue by 20 billion yuan. This year, the planned ton-kilometers of freight transport are 20% higher than last year, and the first quarter alone has completed 35.9% of the annual plan. (Liu Zaoyu)

Also reported: On the basis of the victory of harnessing the Huai River in the past three years, Henan Province has mobilized and relied on the broad masses to overcome the floods during the flood season, and autumn crops in the main and branch river basins of the Honghe and Huaihe rivers have generally achieved bumper harvests.

During this year's flood season, the rainfall in the Huai River plain was heavy and concentrated. From June to August, the rainfall in Baisha in the upper reaches of the Ying River reached 570 mm, and the rainfall in Shimantan in the upper reaches of the Hong River reached 540 mm, accounting for about 70% of the total annual rainfall in normal years. However, due to the repairs and dredging of the main and branch rivers of the Hong and Huai rivers in the past three years, and the general heightening and reinforcement of the dikes, the threat of floods along the rivers has been greatly reduced. In particular, the construction of the Shimantan Reservoir in Wuyang in the upper reaches of the Hong River, the Banqiao Reservoir in Biyang County in the upper reaches of the Ru River, and the Baisha Reservoir in Yuxian County in the upper reaches of the Ying River has resulted in the three reservoirs impounding a total of more than 179 million cubic meters of floodwater, which not only directly lowered the water levels of the Hong, Ru, and Ying rivers, but also played a significant role in eliminating waterlogging in the Huai River basin. The river channel improvement projects of the Ying River, Bao River, and Hei River completed this spring have also spared more than 4 million mu of farmland from flood disasters this year. At the same time, the Hong River, which has caused the greatest damage in Henan, for the longest time, and has a main stem of more than 800 li, was again subjected to cut-off and dredging projects involving 14.4 million cubic meters of earthwork completed by 330,000 laborers this spring. More than 400,000 cubic meters of earthwork left over from the spring project were completed before the summer flood. Therefore, when the Hong River's Bantai flow reached 757 cubic meters per second in early August, no overflow or breach occurred in the dikes along the river (last year, when the Bantai flow was 640 cubic meters per second, the disaster area on both sides of the Hong River's main stream reached more than 2 million mu).

In the process of flood prevention, relying on and mobilizing the broad masses to actively rescue has also turned many rivers from danger to safety. This year, all localities have formed large numbers of mass flood prevention teams and prepared sufficient flood prevention materials. During rescue operations, party and government leading organs at all levels also dispatched a large number of cadres to help and organize the masses to fight against the flood. In one rescue operation in Puyang Prefecture, more than 800 cadres participated, leading the masses to continuously rescue for five days and nights, ensuring that 147 kilometers of dikes did not breach. In July and August, the Ying and Quan rivers, tributaries of the Huai River, exceeded the warning water level. Due to the masses actively repairing the dikes and rescuing the dangerous works, most of them did not experience accidents. The maximum flow of the Zhang River in Anyang Prefecture reached 1,959 cubic meters per second, exceeding the guarantee of 400 cubic meters per second. The Changshui Town in Luoning, Luoyang Prefecture, exceeded the safe water level by 1.1 meters, and Luoyang by 1.4 meters, and the flow also exceeded 400 cubic meters per second. Thanks to hard work in guarding and timely rescue, accidents were ultimately avoided.

Due to the mobilization of the masses to overcome the floods on the basis of the victory in harnessing the Huai River in Henan Province, tens of millions of mu of autumn crops in the entire Huai River Plain and the Hong River banks in the northwest have achieved bumper harvests unseen for many years, except for some areas suffering from waterlogging. The yields of harvested crops are higher than in previous years. The yield of sorghum is generally more than 200 jin per mu, and the highest yield in Runan reaches 280 jin.

    引黄灌溉济卫工程效益显著
    河南省治淮后数千万亩秋田获丰收
    引黄灌溉济卫工程的兴修，已使河南省京汉铁路两侧新乡、获嘉等六县七十余万亩缺水农田获得及时灌溉，新乡到天津九百多公里的卫河航运得以畅通。
    引黄灌溉济卫工程是在黄河北岸京汉路铁桥附近开一总干渠，将黄河的水引出一部，使在新乡附近流入卫河。再在总干渠两侧开掘干渠和支渠，引水灌溉附近获嘉、新乡、武陟、原阳、汲县、延津等县雨水不及时的广大农田。由于黄河本身自然条件不好，又加以国民党反动统治时不修堤防、破坏山林，这一带经常遭受水、旱灾害的侵袭，农民无法生活，大批出外逃荒。解放后，在毛主席兴利与除害并重的治黄方针下，黄河水利委员会在一九四九年冬提出引黄灌溉济卫工程的方案，经过充分准备于一九五一年三月正式开工，修筑总干渠、西干渠、东一干渠以及水闸、桥梁等主要工程，十二月底第一期工程提前完工。一九五二年四月正式放水，除济卫外，东一、西一两个灌区也开始灌溉。第二阶段包括沉淀区及东三、东二、新磁、小冀四个灌区工程，于一九五二年六月开始，十二月完成。第三阶段为部分工程的加固和整修及沉淀区的建筑物工程，今年二月开始，八月完成，灌区全部工程至此基本结束。共计完成各级渠道一万二千一百七十六条，全长五千七百二十六公里，其中干渠四条，支渠十四条，计长二百六十三公里，各级排水渠计长二千一百余公里。全部土方约计一千六百余万公方。完成进水闸、分水闸、节制闸、跌水、渡槽、倒虹管、桥梁、斗门等各种建筑物一千四百九十九座，使用料物十三万零七百公吨。仅建筑施工即动员人工二十四万四千个日工。
    引黄灌溉济卫工程已获得了巨大效益。一九五二年六月间大秋作物下种时，河南北部适逢干旱，七月至九月作物迫切需水时又一直没有下雨，但由于引黄第一期工程的完工，保证了东一、西一两个灌区二十八万四千亩农田的及时灌溉。浇过水的棉花、玉米、谷子比没浇水的每亩要多收一倍至四、五倍，增产总值在五百七十多亿元。由于当年秋季灌溉底墒足，小麦下种及时，今春小麦返青时，凡缺墒的又都进行了灌溉，因而水分足，地温高，麦苗旺盛，抗灾力强，四月间虽普降寒霜，灌区麦苗受灾很轻，而且经及时浇水抢救，又很快恢复原状。小麦灌浆时又进行了灌溉。因此，今年凡是经过灌溉的小麦，一般每亩比常年产量增加六、七十斤。东一灌区有二百多亩产量高达三、四百斤。今年，渠首加固后，渠首闸引水量由四十个秒公方提高到五十个秒公方，其中二十三个秒公方济卫，二十七个秒公方灌溉，灌溉面积从原计划三十六万亩扩大到七十二万亩。卫河从前水量不足，平时一般木船只能装载五成至七成，尤其新乡至临清段，河床浅窄，枯水季节，航运停顿。自引黄以来，就保证了卫河航运的畅通，一百吨的木船可满载。一九五二年完成卫河货物航运吨公里数约为一九五一年的百分之一六二，增加运费收入二百亿元。今年计划货运吨公里数较去年扩大了百分之二十，单是第一季度已完成全年计划百分之三十五点九。（刘造宇）
    又讯：河南省在三年来治淮胜利的基础上，发动和依靠广大群众战胜了汛期洪水，洪河淮河干支流域秋季作物普遍获得丰收。
    今年汛期中，淮河平原雨量大而集中。六月到八月，颍河上游白沙一带降雨量达五百七十公厘，洪河上游石漫滩一带达五百四十公厘，都占平常年份全年总雨量百分之七十左右。但由于洪、淮干支河流经过三年来的整修、疏浚，堤防普遍加高加固，大大减轻了沿河两岸水灾威胁。特别是修好了洪河上游舞阳的石漫滩水库、汝河上游泌阳县的板桥水库、颍河上游禹县的白沙水库，三座水库共拦蓄洪水一亿七千九百多万立方公尺，不但直接降低洪、汝、颍三河的水位，对消除淮河流域水涝也起着重大作用。今春完成的颍河、包河、黑河等河道整理工程，也给今年汛期免除了四百余万亩耕地的洪水灾害。同时在河南为害最大、时间最长、主干长达八百余华里的洪河，今春又经三十三万民工完成了一千四百余万土方的裁湾、疏浚工程，夏汛前又突击完成春工遗留的四十多万土方，因而在八月初洪河班台流量达七百五十七个秒公方时，沿河堤防也没有发生漫溢和溃决（去年班台流量六百四十秒公方时，洪河干流两侧受灾面积即达二百余万亩）。
    在防汛过程中，由于依靠和发动广大群众积极抢救，也使很多河流转危为安。今年各地都组成了大批群众性的防汛队伍，并准备了足够的防汛器材。在抢险时，各级党、政领导机关又抽出大批干部，帮助和组织群众和洪水作斗争。濮阳专区在一次抢险中，参加的干部有八百余人，领导群众连续抢救了五昼夜，保证了一百四十七公里长的堤防没决口。七、八月间，淮河支流颍河、泉河都超过警戒水位，由于群众积极抢修了堤防、抢救了险工，大部没有出险。安阳专区漳河最大流量达一千九百五十九个秒公方，超过保证四百个秒公方。洛阳专区洛宁长水镇超过安全水位一点一公尺，洛阳一点四公尺，流量也超过四百秒公方，也因守护努力、抢救及时，终免出险。
    河南省由于在治淮胜利基础上发动群众战胜了洪水，使整个淮河平原和西北的洪河两岸，除部分内涝外，数千万亩秋季作物获得多年未有的丰收。现已收完的庄稼产量都比往年高，高粱产量一般每亩二百多斤，汝南最高产量达二百八十斤。
