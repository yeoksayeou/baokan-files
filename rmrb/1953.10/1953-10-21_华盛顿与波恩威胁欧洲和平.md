    Washington and Bonn Threaten European Peace
    Tan Wenrui

    In its note to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States on September 28, the Soviet government pointed out: "Regarding Europe, the recent political developments in West Germany have caused greater alarm in peace-loving countries. In West Germany, particularly due to the pressure exerted by foreign groups relying on German monopoly capital, the forces of revanchism have grown, and they have once again begun to propose the 'eastward advance' policy that once brought infinite disasters to the peoples of all countries and even the German people themselves. Although this policy is ultimately doomed to failure, the peace-loving countries of Europe, especially West Germany's neighbors, cannot ignore the negative facts in the aforementioned West German political developments, because in the heart of Europe, yesterday's Hitlerites are becoming increasingly rampant, and the threat of establishing a dangerous new hotbed of aggression is growing."

    This is indeed the case. After Adenauer, relying on the shameless interference of his American masters and fascist violence, continued to maintain his puppet regime in the September 6 election, he arrogantly clamored to rely on "strength" and "Western friends" to "liberate the eastern territories." In other words, he wants to use force to conquer the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Poland. At the same time, he brazenly acted as the American gendarme in Western Europe, trying his best to promote the establishment of the Western European aggressive bloc within this year, so that West Germany can be armed as soon as possible and become the backbone of the so-called "European Army," so as to realize the plan of "unifying Europe." In order to step up the reconstruction of Hitler's Wehrmacht and incite war, Adenauer is also preparing to formally establish an army ministry and a Goebbels-style "propaganda ministry" in his Bonn government. This unbridled behavior more clearly exposes the sinister faces of the Adenauer group, a small group of revanchists.

    In fact, Adenauer's actions are not surprising at all. The Adenauer group was originally a tool for the United States to split Germany and prepare for war in Europe. The Adenauer group wholeheartedly pursues the American policy of deepening the division of Germany and turning Germany into a new hotbed of war in Europe, attempting to rebuild West Germany's military power by submitting to the United States, and dragging Germany into the new war that the United States is preparing, so as to restore the status of German imperialism in future military adventures. Adenauer's recent clamoring for "liberating the east" and "unifying Europe" is part of this plan.

    The Adenauer group pins its sinister dreams on the Bonn and Paris war treaties. These two treaties not only make the peaceful unification of Germany impossible, but will ultimately lead West Germany onto the road to war. After the signing of these two treaties last year, the British "Manchester Guardian" pointed out: "These treaties have deepened the division of Germany. The eastern border of the Federal Republic (i.e., West Germany) is no longer merely the dividing line of the military occupation zones, but has become a defense frontier of a country participating in the anti-Soviet Atlantic alliance." In particular, the "European Defense Community" treaty stipulates that West Germany will provide twelve divisions of mercenaries to the "European Army." Once this treaty is implemented, West Germany's activities to rebuild the Nazi "Wehrmacht" can be carried out openly, instead of secretly under the guise of "police reserve teams" and "labor battalions" as in the past. General Heusinger, who served as the operations director of Hitler's General Staff and is now Adenauer's military advisor, once said: "Merging a part of the German army into the 'European Army' can enable Germany to rebuild its military strength in its heyday." This general recently announced in his capacity as the director of the military department of the Bonn Ministry of Defense: West Germany plans to establish a "Wehrmacht" with 450,000 people. This is undoubtedly the "strength" that the Adenauer group wants to rely on to achieve the goals of "liberating the east" and "unifying Europe." Adenauer himself does not shy away from his revanchist intentions, saying: "Only by joining the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty can it be possible to regain Germany's east." He also publicly clamored: The Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty must become the starting point for the "new order" in Europe and the world. Regarding the meaning of this "new order," one of Adenauer's ministers explained: "It is not that Germany should join Europe, but that Europe should join Germany."

    All of this shows that the Adenauer group is following Hitler's old path. Their sinister conspiracy will not only drive the German people into the abyss of destruction once again, but also increasingly seriously threaten the security of Germany's neighbors. Adenauer's public announcement of his revanchist plan after the election cannot but arouse shock and indignation in public opinion in Western European countries. The Dutch "De Waarheid" pointed out that Adenauer's clamoring is "a call to a war of aggression," the British "Daily Express" believes that this is "the prelude to the use of force," and the Swedish "Morgontidningen" more fully expresses the anxiety of the Western European bourgeoisie. This newspaper said: In Adenauer's speech, "We heard the sound of German troops advancing again."

    Adenauer's crazy clamoring to provoke European peace and security has been applauded by Washington. In a telegram to Adenauer, US President Eisenhower said that the US government "will be happy to cooperate with the Federal Republic" in implementing these plans. It is not difficult to see from this that Adenauer is so arrogant precisely because he has received encouragement from across the Atlantic.

    The American reactionary forces have placed their bet on the Adenauer government to maintain tension and create a new war in Europe.

    Recently, the Soviet Union and the entire peace and democracy camp have made significant achievements in striving for peace, which has eased international tensions somewhat. In order to promote the peaceful settlement of the German question as soon as possible, the Soviet Union has put forward reasonable proposals for resolving the German question. This just action of the Soviet Union is fully in line with the sincere peace aspirations of the German people and the people of Western European countries, and points out a clear path for Germany to restore itself as a unified, independent, peace-loving and democratic country.

    However, peace is not to the taste of the American reactionary forces. They are colluding with the Adenauer group to pursue an adventurous policy in Europe. Therefore, on the day the West German election results were announced, Washington's diplomatic officials hinted: "After this incident, the United States will adopt a 'take it or leave it' policy when dealing with the Soviet Union on the German question." Adenauer also publicly echoed on September 15: "The Western countries must continue to adopt a policy of strength towards the East." It can be seen that the American reactionary forces are relying on Adenauer's traitorous actions to further obstruct the peaceful resolution of the German question.

    According to the American "New York Times": The United States has assured Adenauer that it will supply the entire equipment used by the 100,000-man officer corps of the West German mercenary army, including 2,360 tanks, to ensure that West Germany "rearms in the shortest possible time." At the same time, the United States is openly intimidating Western European countries with the specter of rebuilding the Nazi Wehrmacht. The "New York Times" warned France in an editorial on September 9: "Unless France is determined and approves this treaty (referring to the 'European Army' treaty), France's leadership in Europe will be in danger of losing to the 'New Germany,' and there is a danger of causing individual solutions to problems, such as establishing a separate German army under the leadership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." In order to further exert pressure on France and other Western European countries, the United States has arranged for French Prime Minister Laniel to hold talks with Eisenhower recently. US Assistant Secretary of State Merchant convened a meeting of US ambassadors to Western European countries in Luxembourg, actively making arrangements to force the parliaments of various countries to quickly approve the "European Army" treaty. It is said that this meeting has decided to give France a final deadline of three months. This increasingly frequent activity of the United States fully exposes the urgent desire of the American reactionary forces to accelerate the revival of West Germany's aggressive military forces under the cloak of the "European Army."

    Therefore, it is very clear that Adenauer's clamoring is in fact a clumsy double act sung by Bonn and Washington. Adenauer's words and deeds reflect the position of the American reactionary forces in obstructing and undermining German unification and European peace.

    However, the peace-loving forces in Germany and Western European countries will not allow the American reactionary forces and the Adenauer group to act arbitrarily. German Democratic Republic President Pieck, at a recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, called on the entire German working class to unite, saying: "The entire German working class forming a united front to struggle outside the parliament can smash Adenauer's policy of preparing for war and military adventure." The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party also issued a statement on September 7, calling on all those in West Germany who oppose Adenauer to unite to stop him from implementing policies that endanger Germany.

    Some political figures in Western European countries have also expressed dissatisfaction with the Adenauer group's clamoring and the United States' arrogant practice of forcing countries to ratify the "European Army" treaty. At the recent meeting of the "European Consultative Assembly," the issue of rearming West Germany also caused fierce disputes. Representatives of parliaments in Western European countries are afraid of the resurgence of West German militarism. In particular, the Soviet Union's note to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States at the end of last month reiterated its proposal to discuss measures to comprehensively ease international tensions and restore German unification and conclude a peace treaty with Germany, which aroused widespread reaction in Western Europe. The New York "Herald Tribune" had to admit: "State Department officials seem to be worried that the Soviet note will arouse greater interest in London and Paris than in Washington. The United States has long been lukewarm to proposals for holding four-power talks on the German question or on any issue outside the most limited agenda. ... But in London and Paris, a considerable proportion of the public and political figures have long yearned for any high-level meeting, as long as it has the possibility of easing the Cold War."

    These facts clearly demonstrate the firm will of the German people to oppose the Adenauer group's traitorous policy and the legitimate desire of the public in Western European countries to resolve the German question through consultation. This once again irrefutably proves that the German question can only be resolved through consultation; the unification of Germany can only be achieved on the basis of agreement between East and West Germany. The practice of the American reactionary forces and the Adenauer group colluding with each other in an attempt to turn West Germany into a hotbed of war again will make them even more isolated among the German people and the people of Western European countries. As President Pieck recently pointed out: "Among the peace-loving people, a sentiment of aversion and hatred towards fascist militarist West Germany will regrow. The crisis of West Germany's domestic and foreign policies will be inevitable."

    华盛顿与波恩威胁欧洲和平
    谭文瑞
    苏联政府九月二十八日给法、英、美三国政府的照会中指出：“关于欧洲，西德最近的政治局势发展在爱好和平的国家里引起了更大的惊恐。在西德，特别是由于外国集团倚靠德国大垄断资本所施行的压力，报复主义分子的势力有了增长，他们又再次开始提出那个曾经带给各国人民以至德国人民本身无限灾难的‘东进’政策。虽然这个政策终归免不了要失败，欧洲爱好和平的国家，特别是西德的邻国却不能忽视上述西德政治局势发展中的消极事实，因为在这欧洲的心脏地区，昨日的希特勒分子正愈来愈嚣张，建立危险的新侵略温床的威胁正在增长。”
    事实正是这样。阿登纳依赖它的美国主子的无耻干涉以及法西斯的暴力手段在九月六日的选举中继续维持了他的傀儡政权之后，就狂妄地叫嚣要靠
    “实力”和“西方的朋友”来“解放东部领土”。换句话说，就是要用武力征服德意志民主共和国和波兰人民共和国。同时，他又俨然以美国在西欧的宪兵身分，竭力鼓吹要在今年之内成立西欧侵略集团，使西德能够尽速武装起来，成为所谓“欧洲军”的骨干，从而实现“统一欧洲”的计划。为了加紧进行重建希特勒国防军并鼓动战争，阿登纳还准备在他的波恩政府中正式成立陆军部和戈培尔式的“宣传部”。这种肆无忌惮的行径使阿登纳集团这一小撮复仇主义者的凶恶面目更清楚地暴露出来了。
    其实，阿登纳的这种举动是毫不足怪的。阿登纳集团原是美国分裂德国并在欧洲准备战争的工具。阿登纳集团死心塌地奉行美国加深德国分裂以及变德国为欧洲新的战争温床的政策，企图以对美国的臣服来重建西德的军事力量，并把德国卷入美国正在准备的新战争之中，以便在未来的军事冒险中恢复德国帝国主义的地位。阿登纳最近叫嚣的“解放东部”和“统一欧洲”，正是这个计划的一部分。
    阿登纳集团把他们的罪恶梦想寄托在波恩和巴黎两个战争条约上。这两个条约不仅使德国的和平统一成为不可能，而且最后必将使西德走上战争的道路。在去年这两个条约签订后，英国的“曼彻斯特卫报”就曾指出：“这些条约加深了德国的分裂。联邦共和国（即西德）的东部边界不再仅是各军事占领区的分界线，而已成为一个参加反苏的大西洋联盟的国家的国防前线了。”特别是“欧洲防务集团”条约，规定了西德向“欧洲军”提供十二个师的雇佣军。这个条约一旦付诸实施，西德重建纳粹“国防军”的活动就可以不再像过去那样在“警察后备队”、“劳动大队”等名目的掩盖下偷偷摸摸地进行，而可以公开从事了。曾经充当希特勒参谋总部作战部长、现任阿登纳军事顾问的许辛格将军曾经说过：“把德国军队的一部分合并到‘欧洲军’里去，可以使德国重建以前全盛时代的军力。”这位将军最近已以波恩国防部军事司长的身分公开宣布：西德计划成立一支拥有四十五万人的“国防军”。这无疑就是阿登纳集团要依靠来达到“解放东部”和“统一欧洲”的目的的“实力”。阿登纳自己也不讳言他的复仇主义的意图，他说过：
    “只有加入欧洲联盟和北大西洋公约去，才有可能重新获得德国的东方。”他并且公开叫嚣：波恩条约和巴黎条约必须成为欧洲和全世界“新秩序”的起点。关于这种“新秩序”的含义，阿登纳的一个部长曾解释说：“不是德国应加入欧洲，而是欧洲应当加入德国。”
    这一切都说明了，阿登纳集团正在走着希特勒的老路。他们的罪恶图谋，不仅将把德国人民再一次驱向毁灭的深渊，而且日益严重地威胁着德国邻国的安全。阿登纳在选举后公然宣布他的复仇主义计划，这就不能不激起西欧各国舆论的震惊和愤懑。荷兰“真理报”指出，阿登纳的叫嚣是“侵略战争的号召”，英国“每日快报”认为这是“动武的先声”，而瑞典“晨报”的言论更充分表现了西欧资产阶级的忧虑情绪，这个报纸说：在阿登纳的演说中，“我们又听到了德国军队前进的声音了”。
    阿登纳对欧洲的和平与安全进行挑衅的疯狂叫嚣，得到了华盛顿的喝采。美国总统艾森豪威尔在给阿登纳的电报中说，阿登纳在执行这些计划时美国政府“将乐于与联邦共和国合作。”人们不难由此看出，阿登纳之所以如此嚣张，正是因为他得到了大西洋彼岸的鼓励。
    美国反动势力已把他们在欧洲保持紧张局势和制造新战争的赌注，压在阿登纳政府的身上了。
    最近以来，苏联和整个和平民主阵营争取和平的努力取得了重大的成就，使国际紧张局势有了一些缓和；为了早日促成德国问题的和平解决，苏联并提出了解决德国问题的合理建议。苏联的这种正义行动是完全符合于德国人民和西欧各国人民深切的和平愿望的，并为德国恢复成为一个统一、独立、爱好和平与民主的国家指出了明确的道路。
    但是，和平是不合乎美国反动势力的口味的。他们正与阿登纳集团串通一气，在欧洲推行冒险政策。因而在西德选举揭晓的当天，华盛顿的外交官员就暗示：“美国在这次事件以后与苏联在德国问题上打交道时将采用一个‘要就要，不要就拉倒’的政策”。阿登纳在九月十五日也公然唱和说：“西方国家对东方就必须继续采取实力政策。”由此可见，美国反动势力正依靠着阿登纳的卖国行为来进一步阻挠德国问题的和平解决。
    据美国“纽约时报”的透露：美国已向阿登纳保证，供给西德雇佣军的十万人军官团使用的全副装备，包括二千三百六十辆坦克，以保证西德“在最短期间内重新武装起来。”同时，美国却又以重建纳粹国防军的魔影，公开向西欧各国施行恫吓。“纽约时报”在九月九日的社论中曾向法国威吓说：“除非法国下定决心并批准这个条约（指“欧洲军”条约），否则法国对欧洲的领导权将有失给‘新德国’的危险，并且有引起问题的个别解决的危险，譬如在北大西洋公约组织领导下建立一支单独的德国军队。”为了对法国及西欧其他国家进一步施行压力，美国已安排了法国总理拉尼埃与艾森豪威尔在最近举行会谈；美国助理国务卿麦钱特并在卢森堡召集美国驻西欧国家的使节开会，积极进行布置，以迫使各国议会迅速批准“欧洲军”条约。据说这个会议已决定给予法国三个月的最后期限。美国这种日益频繁的活动，充分暴露了美国反动势力企图在“欧洲军”的外衣下加速复活西德侵略军事力量的急迫心情。
    因此，事情很明白，阿登纳的叫嚣事实上是波恩与华盛顿合唱的一幕拙劣的双簧。阿登纳的言行反映了美国反动势力阻挠和破坏德国统一与欧洲和平的立场。
    但是，德国和西欧各国爱好和平的力量是不会容许美国反动势力及阿登纳集团任意猖狂行事的。德意志民主共和国总统皮克在最近举行的德国统一社会党中央委员会全体会议上号召全德工人阶级团结一致，他说：“全德工人阶级结成统一阵线在议会外进行斗争，就可以粉碎阿登纳准备战争和军事冒险的方针。”德国共产党中央委员会书记处也于九月七日发表声明，号召西德一切反对阿登纳的人联合起来，阻止他实行危害德国的政策。
    西欧各国的某些政界人士对阿登纳集团的叫嚣和美国迫使各国批准“欧洲军”条约的蛮横作法也表示不满。在最近举行的“欧洲谘询议会”会议上，重新武装西德问题也引起了激烈的争吵，西欧各国议会代表都害怕西德军国主义的再起。特别是苏联上月底照会法、英、美三国政府重申讨论使国际紧张局势全面缓和的措施及恢复德国统一和缔结对德和约问题的主张，在西欧引起了广泛反应。纽约“先驱论坛报”也不得不承认：“国务院官员似乎忧虑苏联的照会在伦敦和巴黎会比在华盛顿引起更大的兴趣。对于举行四国会议讨论德国问题或讨论最有限的议程以外的任何问题的主张，美国很久以来一直是冷淡的。……但是在伦敦和巴黎，长期以来就有相当大一部分公众和政界人士渴望举行任何高级会议，只要它有缓和冷战的可能。”
    这些事实清楚地表现了德国人民反对阿登纳集团卖国政策的坚决意志和西欧各国公众主张以协商方式解决德国问题的正当愿望。这再一次无可辩驳地证明，德国问题只有通过协商方式才能获得解决；德国的统一只有在东西德协议的基础上才能实现。美国反动势力与阿登纳集团相互勾结，企图将西德重新变为战争温床的做法，将会使他们在德国人民和西欧各国人民当中更加陷于孤立的地位。正如皮克总统最近所指出的：“在爱好和平的人民中将重新滋长一种厌恶痛恨法西斯军国主义西德的情绪。西德对内对外政策的危机将不可避免。”
