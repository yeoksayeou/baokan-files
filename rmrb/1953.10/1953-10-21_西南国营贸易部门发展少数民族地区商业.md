    Southwest state-owned trading departments, since expanding trade work in ethnic minority areas, have seen the commerce of ethnic minorities develop daily, and the production and living standards of all ethnic groups are gradually improving.
    In the first half of this year, state-owned trading departments invested a total of 174.4 billion yuan, purchasing large quantities of local and special products from ethnic minority areas. In Sichuan, Xikang, and Guizhou provinces, the value of various local and special products purchased reached 61.3 billion yuan. Guizhou Province held 95 primary market material exchange meetings in the first half of the year, and held local and special product exhibitions at the meetings to introduce the sales channels and uses of local and special products to the ethnic minority people, and to inspire ethnic minorities to actively engage in local and special product operations.
    Simultaneous with the purchases, trade departments in various places supplied large quantities of means of production and consumer goods needed by ethnic minorities. In the first half of the year, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Xikang provinces transported 6.09 million catties of edible salt and more than 500,000 bolts of homespun cloth to ethnic minority areas. The Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang sent local Tibetan cadres to investigate the needs of the people in the region for materials and to formulate a procurement plan. In the first half of this year, more than 33,000 pieces of various agricultural tools and wool shears, and 6,932 iron pots for boiling tea and stir-frying qingke (highland barley), were supplied. The Grain Company transferred a large amount of grain to the pastoral areas, and the department store allocated a large quantity of crimson fabrics favored by the Tibetan people from Shanghai. In the transactions, in addition to conscientiously implementing the policy of equivalent exchange, the prices of daily necessities were reduced in a planned manner and the prices of local and special products were increased. In Aba Tibetan Autonomous Region in northwestern Sichuan, before liberation, one hundred catties of wool could be exchanged for three bricks of tea, but now it can be exchanged for fourteen bricks; in Liping and Congjiang counties in Guizhou, before liberation, forty catties of rice could be exchanged for one catty of salt, but now it can be exchanged for ten catties of salt.
    Due to the strengthening of ethnic trade work, agricultural and sideline production of ethnic minorities has also developed. The state-owned trading company of Dali Prefecture, Yunnan Province, signed many purchase, processing, and ordering contracts with Bai and Hui ethnic minority handicraft workers in Dali, Dengchuan, Menghua, and Xiaguan starting in January of this year. The number of Bai ethnic minority looms in Dali has developed to 5,000, an increase of 60% compared with last year; the vermicelli production of the Bai ethnic minority in Dengchuan reached 100,000 catties per month, an increase of 30% compared with last year. State-owned trade departments in various places have also cooperated with cooperatives to supply a large number of agricultural tools to ethnic minorities. The state-owned trade store in the Miao Autonomous Region of Lushan County, Guizhou Province, specially processed and manufactured agricultural tools suitable for the habits of Miao farmers.
    State-owned trade organizations in ethnic minority areas in Southwest China are expanding day by day, and the number of cadres is constantly increasing. According to statistics in July this year, there are 557 state-owned trade branches, sub-companies, stores, and trade teams scattered in ethnic minority areas, with more than 5,000 cadres, of which 886 ethnic minority trade cadres have been trained. State-owned trade departments in various places also help ethnic minorities learn business operations and establish and restore markets. For example, in Ceheng and Wangmo counties, the southernmost part of Guizhou Province, where ethnic minorities did not engage in business in the past, there are now 14 industries such as local products and department stores. Sanri Street in Dali County, Yunnan Province, was originally a market for Tibetan, Lisu, Yi, Moxi, Hui, and Tujia ethnic groups in western Yunnan. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, ethnic minorities did not dare to go to the market, and it was deserted for many years. It has now been restored. In the past, the Aini and Lahu ethnic groups in Lancang County had to go to Cheli, Fohai, and other counties to exchange red sugar, edible salt, and daily necessities for tea they picked, but now they can exchange them at the newly built markets nearby. Maoxian and Aba in Sichuan Province, where there were no markets in the past, have now established markets.
    Due to the correct implementation of ethnic trade policies in various places, the business enthusiasm of ethnic minority merchants has increased day by day, and the number of merchants has continued to increase. There are a total of 170 merchants in Ganzi County, Xikang Province, of which 144 have newly opened this year, including as many as 42 Tibetan merchants. After the Kangzang Highway opened to traffic in Qamdo, many lamaseries along the line also began to engage in business. Originally, only four Ganzi Lamasery had storefronts in the market, but now it has increased to ten. Kasa Lamasery has newly opened four stores, and Dege Lamasery has selected more than 30 heads to manage the business. Tibetan merchants in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Maoxian County, Sichuan Province, have been continuously increasing the number of people who go to Chengdu to sell local and special products and bring back industrial products.

    西南国营贸易部门发展少数民族地区商业
    西南国营贸易部门自扩大对少数民族地区的贸易工作后，少数民族的商业日益发展，各族人民生产和生活水平正逐渐提高。
    今年上半年，国营贸易部门共投放了资金一千七百四十四亿元，大量收购少数民族地区的土、特产。在四川、西康、贵州三省收购各种土、特产的价值达六百十三亿元。贵州省上半年召开了九十五次初级市场物资交流会，在会上并举办土、特产展览，向少数民族人民介绍当地土、特产的销路和用途，启发少数民族积极经营土、特产。
    与收购同时，各地贸易部门大批供应了少数民族需要的生产资料和生活资料。四川、云南、西康三省上半年运到少数民族地区的食盐六百零九万斤，土布五十多万匹。西康藏族自治区曾派出当地藏族干部调查区内人民对物资需要的情况，订出采购计划。今年上半年供应了各种农具和羊毛剪等三万三千多件，熬茶和炒青稞的铁锅六千九百三十二口。粮食公司给牧区人民调来大批粮食，百货公司由上海拨来大批藏族人民所喜爱的绛色布料。交易中各地除认真贯彻等价交换政策外，并有计划地降低日用品价格提高土、特产价格。四川西北部阿坝藏族自治区解放前一百斤羊毛换三块茶砖，现在可换十四块；贵州黎平、从江等县，解放前四十斤米换一斤盐，现在可换十斤盐。
    由于民族贸易工作的加强，少数民族农、副业生产也有了发展，云南省大理专区国营贸易公司，今年一月份起，在大理、邓川、蒙化和下关等地和民家族、回族手工业者，签订了许多收购、加工、订货的合同，大理民家族的织布机已发展至五千架，比去年增加百分之六十；邓川民家族的粉丝生产，每月达十万斤，较去年增加百分之三十。各地国营贸易部门并配合合作社为少数民族供应了大批农具。贵州省炉山县苗族自治区国营贸易商店，特别加工制造适于苗族农民习惯的农具。
    西南少数民族地区国营贸易机构日益扩大，干部不断增加。今年七月份统计，散布在少数民族地区的国营贸易分、支公司、商店和贸易小组有五百五十七个，干部五千多人，其中培养了少数民族贸易干部八百八十六人。各地国营贸易部门并帮助少数民族学习经营，建立和恢复集市。例如，贵州省最南端册亨、望谟两县，过去少数民族没有经商的，现在已有土产、百货等十四个行业。云南省大理县三日街，原是云南西部藏、傈僳、彝、摩西、回、土家等民族的集市，国民党反动派统治时期，少数民族不敢赶集，冷落多年，现已恢复。澜沧县境内的爱尼族、拉祜族过去采了茶要到车里、佛海等县才能换到红糖、食盐和日用品，如今却能在附近新建的集市上换到了。过去没有集市的四川省茂县、阿坝等地如今也都建立了集市。
    由于各地正确贯彻民族贸易政策，少数民族商人的经营积极性日益提高，商户不断增加。西康省甘孜县共有商人一百七十户，今年新开业的就有一百四十四户，其中藏族商人有四十二户之多。康藏公路通车昌都后，沿线不少喇嘛寺也开始经商。甘孜喇嘛寺原在市场开门面的只有四家，现已增为十家，喀萨喇嘛寺新开商店四家，德格喇嘛寺已选了三十多个会首来经营商业。四川省茂县藏族自治区藏族商人到成都销售土、特产，贩回工业品的已不断增加。    （本报西南记者站李策）
