    The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Member Representative Conference has opened today. On behalf of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, I congratulate the conference on its success!
    I think the convening of this conference is very timely. After the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference released the slogans celebrating National Day, the people of the whole country responded enthusiastically to the call to strive to realize the general line of the state during the transition period and the basic tasks of the first five-year plan. The general line of the transition period is like a lighthouse, illuminating the way forward for the Chinese people.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have made great achievements in the past few years in their efforts to realize the general line of the transition period. From this year, our country has entered a new period of planned national economic construction. The state's first five-year construction plan is a major step towards realizing the general line of the transition period. The Central People's Government has approved and promulgated the basic tasks of the first five-year plan. Its central task is to focus on developing heavy industry with the state-owned economy as the main body, so as to establish the foundation for the country's socialist industrialization and the modernization of national defense. We must build a strong heavy industry in order to consolidate national defense, guarantee our country's economic independence, and provide a material and technological basis for the development of light industry and the transformation of agriculture. Our economic construction must also take the state-owned economy as the main body. The state-owned economy "is the main material basis for the development of production and the prosperity of the economy of the People's Republic and the leading force of the entire social economy." (Article 28 of the Common Program) Only the strong development of the state-owned economy can ensure the high tide of the entire national economy, meet the gradually increasing needs of the people's livelihood, promote the transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, and correctly exert the role of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, so as to ensure the country's gradual transition to a socialist society. We must rely on the concerted efforts of the people of the whole country and the upsurge of the increase production and practice economy campaign to strive to complete and overfulfill this year's plan, and lay a solid foundation for the completion of the second year's plan and the entire five-year plan.
    In the past few years, the private industrial and commercial sector has made certain contributions to the restoration of the national economy. In the planned national economic construction during the transition period, under the conditions of following the state's guidelines and policies, they can continue to give play to their initiative, provide products, accumulate funds, train cadres, and assist in urban and rural exchanges for the country, and make greater contributions to the country. In the past few years, private industry and commerce have undergone varying degrees of transformation. Experience has proved that completing the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce through state capitalism is a relatively sound guideline and method. The state will continue to guide private industry and commerce onto the path of state capitalism step by step and with differentiation, according to needs, possibilities, and voluntariness. To this end, state economic workers and trade union workers are required to strive to make their work conform to the requirements of the state's guidelines and policies; private industrialists and businessmen are required to love the country, abide by the law, eliminate the "five evils," and correct the ideas and practices of prioritizing profit-seeking. It is hoped that representatives of the industrial and commercial circles will make active efforts in this regard.
    After this meeting, after everyone has discussed and clarified the general line of the transition period, the basic tasks of the five-year plan, and the direction of efforts for private industry and commerce, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce will surely be able to unite and educate the vast number of industrialists and businessmen under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and strive to realize the general line of the transition period and correctly exert the active role of private industry and commerce!

    中央人民政府政务院副总理董必武的致词（摘要）
    中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会今天开幕了，我代表中央人民政府政务院祝贺大会的成功！
    这次大会的召开，我认为是很合时宜的。在中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会庆祝国庆节口号发布之后，全国人民都纷纷热烈地响应为实现国家在过渡时期的总路线和第一个五年计划基本任务而奋斗的号召。过渡时期的总路线像一座灯塔，照亮了中国人民前进的道路。
    中国人民在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导之下，为实现过渡时期的总路线而努力，在过去几年中已取得伟大的成就。从今年起，我们国家开始进入有计划的国民经济建设的新时期。国家的第一个五年建设计划，是实现过渡时期的总路线的重大步骤。中央人民政府已经通过了第一个五年计划的基本任务，并且已经公布了。其中心任务则是要以国营经济为主体，集中主要力量发展重工业，以建立国家的社会主义工业化和国防现代化的基础。我们必须建设强大的重工业，才能巩固国防，才能保证我们国家在经济上的独立，才能给轻工业的发展和农业的改造提供物质和技术的基础。我们的经济建设又必须以国营经济为主体。国营经济“为人民共和国发展生产、繁荣经济的主要物质基础和整个社会经济的领导力量。”（共同纲领第二十八条）只有国营经济的强大发展，才能保证整个国民经济的高涨，满足逐步增长着的人民生活需要，才能促进对农业、对手工业和对私营工商业的改造，并正确地发挥个体农业、手工业和私营工商业的作用，才能保证国家逐步过渡到社会主义社会。我们必须依靠全国人民的一致努力，增产节约运动的高涨，争取完成和超额完成本年度的计划，为第二年度的计划和整个五年计划的完成打下稳固的基础。
    私营工商业界，在过去几年中，对于国家经济的恢复，有其一定的贡献。在过渡时期有计划的国民经济建设中，在遵循国家的方针和政策的条件下，他们可以继续发挥其积极性，为国家供给产品、积累资金、训练干部、协助城乡交流，对国家作更大的贡献。在过去几年中，私营工商业已经经历了不同程度的改造。经验证明：经过国家资本主义完成对私营工商业的社会主义改造，是比较健全的方针和办法。国家将根据需要、可能和自愿，继续有步骤地、有区别地引导私营工商业走上国家资本主义的轨道。为此，要求国家经济工作人员和工会工作人员努力使自己的工作符合于国家的方针政策的要求；要求私营工商业者爱国守法，清除五毒，纠正唯利是图的思想和作风，希望工商界的代表人物，对此作积极的努力。
    经过这次会议，大家讨论和明确了过渡时期总路线、五年计划基本任务及私营工商界努力方向之后，中华全国工商业联合会今后定能在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，团结和教育广大工商业者，为实现过渡时期总路线、正确地发挥私营工商业的积极作用而努力！
