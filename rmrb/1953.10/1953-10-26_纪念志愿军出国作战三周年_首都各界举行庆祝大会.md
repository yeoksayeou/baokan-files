He first extended warm congratulations to all members of the Chinese People's Volunteers on behalf of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, all democratic parties, and all democratic strata.

He went on to say: It should be clearly understood that our great task of resisting America and aiding Korea has not yet been finally completed. We must continue to deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea, strengthen economic construction and national defense, to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in striving for the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, so as to defend lasting peace in the Far East and the world.
