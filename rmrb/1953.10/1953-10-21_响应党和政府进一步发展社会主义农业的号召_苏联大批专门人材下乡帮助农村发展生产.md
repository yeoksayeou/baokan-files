Responding to the call of the Soviet Communist Party and the government to further develop socialist agriculture, specialized personnel from all over the Soviet Union are successively going to the countryside to support the work of further developing socialist agriculture.
In the Stavropol Territory, 2,076 engineers, mechanics, agronomists, livestock specialists, and veterinarians have already gone to the countryside. Every machine tractor station and collective farm in the Ipatovo District of this territory now has a large number of skilled cadres. I. Dovrikov, who won the Stalin Prize for improving the Stavropol fine-wool sheep, worked in the District Agricultural Bureau for a long time and is now a livestock specialist at a machine tractor station in the district. The district has recently added nearly 400 tractor drivers and combine operators. In the Altai Territory, more than 2,000 engineers, agronomists, and livestock specialists from various district central cities have gone to work at machine tractor stations and collective farms. Among the 959 collective farms in the Chkalov Oblast, 756 have full-time agronomists and 203 have full-time livestock specialists. In 27 large collective farms, each farm has two agricultural specialists. In the Chkalov Oblast, 344 tractor drivers and 65 combine operators have returned to work at tractor stations. Dozens of engineers and technicians from factories in the city of Tula have also gone to work in the countryside. In the agricultural organs of various districts in the Tula Oblast, 670 people have been transferred to collective farms to serve as agronomists, livestock specialists, and veterinarians. In the Pskov Oblast, 560 agronomists, livestock specialists, and veterinarians from agricultural and other organs in various districts have gone to work at tractor stations. In the Kuibyshev Oblast, 111 former tractor drivers, combine operators, and fitters have returned to work at tractor stations; 116 engineers and technicians have been transferred from urban industrial enterprises to work at tractor stations.
Non-commissioned officers of the Soviet army who have completed their military service are also asking to go to the countryside. In their letters to "Red Star," they all expressed their willingness to contribute their strength to the work of further developing socialist agriculture. Soldier Rizhula said that the discipline and collectivist education they received in the Soviet army will be of great benefit to their future work in machine tractor stations.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 20th:
Agricultural science research and educational institutions and factory workers in the city of Leningrad are vigorously supporting the countryside to help further develop agricultural production. According to the "Labor Daily," the entire staff of the Agricultural and Animal Physiology Research Office of the Pavlov Institute of Physiology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, under the leadership of Dr. Balishnikov, is expanding the research work on the physiological characteristics of agricultural animals. Scientific staff often go to collective farms and state farms to conduct specific research and help solve problems. The staff of the Agricultural Research Institute of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences are studying ways to increase crop yields in the Northwest. Professor Kolyashev recently proposed a new method of cultivating vegetables with granular fertilizers. This granular fertilizer can be made by any collective farm using a mixture of peat, humus, and mineral fertilizers. The institute has also compiled and published pamphlets to guide collective farms in making this fertilizer. The institute also proposed a wide-tooth row planting method for potatoes and vegetables. This method is of great significance for planting potatoes on peat soils and soils with groundwater, and it is also conducive to the growth of early-maturing vegetables and potatoes. The Institute of Botany of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has twelve experimental stations distributed throughout the country. Collective farms in the Leningrad Oblast have planted new varieties of barley, potatoes, forage grass, eggplant, and cucumber bred by the institute. The Leningrad Agricultural Mechanization Institute is currently training 1,300 mechanical workers for the countryside. In October, a group of mechanics from tractor stations and state farms will graduate from the institute. The Northwest National Machinery Experimental Station in the Volosovo District of the Leningrad Oblast is testing a combine harvester manufactured by the staff of the Leningrad Branch of the All-Union Scientific Research Institute. This combine can harvest wet, large-stalked, and lodged grains. Dozens of machine-building factories in Leningrad are producing tractor parts for the countryside. The "Economist" factory, the "Volcano" factory, and the "Red Metalworker" factory have completed their annual production plan for tractor parts. The Stalin Factory, the Kuibyshev Factory, and the Kotlyakov Factory have produced thousands of parts.
The "Electrical Worker" factory has manufactured 30 welding machines for agricultural machinery personnel in various places. Employees of the Nevsky Chemical Factory have increased the production of superphosphate fertilizer needed throughout the country.

    响应党和政府进一步发展社会主义农业的号召
    苏联大批专门人材下乡帮助农村发展生产
    【新华社莫斯科二十日电】苏联各地专门人材陆续响应苏联共产党和政府的号召，下乡支援进一步发展社会主义农业的工作。
    在斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区，已有两千零七十六个工程师、机械师、农艺师、饲畜师和兽医到农村去。这个边疆区的伊帕托夫区的每个机器拖拉机站和集体农庄，现在差不多都有了大批的熟练干部。曾因改良斯塔夫罗波尔细毛绵羊而获得斯大林奖金的伊·多夫里科夫，在区农业局工作了很久，现在又当了这个区的一个机器拖拉机站的饲畜师。这个区近来增加了近四百名拖拉机手和收割联合机手。阿尔泰边疆区的各区中心城市已有两千个以上的工程师、农艺师和饲畜师等到机器拖拉机站和集体农庄去工作。在契卡洛夫州的九百五十九个集体农庄中，已有七百五十六个农庄有专任的农艺师，有二百零三个农庄有专任的饲畜师。在二十七个大集体农庄中，每个农庄都有两个农业专门人材。契卡洛夫州有三百四十四个拖拉机手和六十五个收割联合机手回到拖拉机站工作。图拉城也有几十个工程师和技师从各工厂去农村工作。图拉州各区的农业机关中已有六百七十人转到集体农庄，担任了农艺师、饲畜师和兽医等。普斯科夫州各区的农业和其他机关有五百六十个农艺师、饲畜师和兽医到拖拉机站去工作。古比雪夫州有一百一十一个以前的拖拉机手、收割联合机手、钳工回到拖拉机站工作；有一百一十六个工程师和技师从城市工业企业中转到拖拉机站工作。
    服军役满期的苏军士官们也纷纷要求到农村去。他们在给“红星报”的信中，都表示愿在更进
    一步发展社会主义农业的工作中贡献自己的力量。战士日茹拉说：在苏军部队中所受到的纪律教育和集体性教育，对他们今后在机器拖拉机站担任工作是有很大好处的。
    【新华社莫斯科二十日电】列宁格勒市内的农业科学研究和教育机构及工厂工作人员，大力展开对农村的支援，帮助进一步发展农业生产。据“劳动报”消息，苏联科学院巴甫洛夫生理学研究所农畜生理研究室的全体人员，在生物学博士巴里希尼科夫的领导下，正在扩大农畜生理特性的研究工作。科学工作人员时常到集体农庄和国营农场去进行具体的研究，帮助解决问题。全苏列宁农业科学院的农业研究所人员，正在研究在西北地区提高农作物收获量的办法。科利雅雪夫教授最近提出了用颗粒肥料来培植蔬菜的新方法。这种颗粒肥料可以由任何集体农庄用泥炭、腐植土和矿质肥料的混合物制成。研究所并为此编写和出版小册子，以便指导集体农庄制造这种肥料。研究所还提出了宽齿条播种马铃薯和蔬菜法。这种方法对于在泥炭土壤和有地下水的土壤上面种植马铃薯有很大意义，而且也有利于早熟蔬菜和马铃薯的生长。苏联科学院植物学研究所有十二个实验站分布在全国各地。列宁格勒州集体农庄中，都种有这个研究所培育的新品种的大麦、马铃薯、牧草、茄子、黄瓜。列宁农业机械化学院现在正为农村培养一千三百个机械工作人员。在十月间，将有一批拖拉机站和国营农场的机械士从这个学院毕业。列宁格勒州沃洛索夫区的西北国立机器实验站，试验着全苏科学研究所列宁格勒分所人员制造的收割联合机。这种联合机能收割潮湿、大秆和倒伏的谷物。列宁格勒有几十个机器制造厂为农村生产着拖拉机零件。“节约者”工厂、“火山”工厂、“红色金属工人”工厂已完成生产拖拉机零件的一年生产计划。斯大林工厂、古
    比雪夫工厂、科特里亚科夫工厂出产了几千种零件。
    “电气工人”工厂为各地农业机械人员制造了三十个焊接机。涅夫斯基化学工厂的职工提高了供应全国各地需要的过磷酸盐肥料的生产。
