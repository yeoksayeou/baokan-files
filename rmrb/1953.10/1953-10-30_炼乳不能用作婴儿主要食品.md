    Condensed Milk Should Not Be Used as the Main Food for Infants
    Editor's Note: Reader Tian Zu'en wrote, pointing out that condensed milk should not be used as the main food for infants and that it is wrong for some condensed milk manufacturers to make false claims on their products. After we contacted the Central Ministry of Health, they agreed with Comrade Tian Zu'en's opinion. Reader Tian Zu'en's letter and the opinion of the Central Ministry of Health are published below:
    Reader Tian Zu'en's Letter
    Tian Zu'en of Peking University Medical College wrote: Condensed milk is not a good milk product, and it is not suitable to feed infants with condensed milk for a long time. Because the sugar content in condensed milk is too high, the protein and fat content are relatively too low. Long-term feeding of infants with condensed milk will inevitably lead to poor growth and development and malnutrition. However, some condensed milk manufacturers often write on their products that condensed milk is "the supreme treasure to replace breast milk, so feeding infants will surely lead to healthy development, strong body and fat body" (White Pigeon brand condensed milk); and even say that condensed milk "can be used to feed children and can indeed replace breast milk... chemists have proved that its growth power is no different from human milk... babies who eat it are very strong and develop quickly, and it is indeed an excellent product for raising children" (Three Sheep condensed milk). Obviously, this kind of propaganda is false; especially for parents with less general knowledge of childcare, the harm of this kind of propaganda is even greater. Of course, it is acceptable to sell condensed milk as a general food; but there should be no such false propaganda. It is hoped that condensed milk manufacturers will make realistic statements about the use of condensed milk on their products in the future, and indicate that it is not suitable for long-term consumption by infants.
    Opinion of the Central Ministry of Health
    A letter from the Central People's Government Ministry of Health: In general condensed milk, a high proportion of sucrose is added during the manufacturing process (often more than 40 percent), so when diluted into usable milk, the fat and protein content is very low and cannot meet the nutritional needs of infants. Although this food is relatively easy to digest and may even cause the consumer to gain weight, it is not suitable for use as a staple food for infants and should never be treated in the same way as unsweetened evaporated milk. If infants consume condensed milk for a long time, they will inevitably develop flaccid, weak muscles and lack of resistance, and are prone to various vitamin deficiencies such as rickets. Therefore, we agree with Reader Tian Zu'en's opinion. In order to protect the health of the second generation, we suggest that the administrative departments of industry and commerce educate condensed milk manufacturers to correct all false and deceptive propaganda marks on condensed milk.

### 炼乳不能用作婴儿主要食品

专栏：读者来信摘要

    炼乳不能用作婴儿主要食品
    编者按：读者田祖恩来信，指出炼乳不能用作婴儿主要食品，目前某些炼乳制造商在制品上作虚伪宣传是不对的。经我们和中央卫生部联系，他们同意田祖恩同志的意见。现将读者田祖恩来信和中央卫生部的意见一并发表在下面：
    读者田祖恩的来信
    北京大学医学院田祖恩来信：炼乳不是一种好乳品，长期用炼乳喂养婴儿是不适宜的。因为炼乳中糖的含量过多，相对地说来，蛋白质与脂肪的含量就过少。长期用炼乳喂养婴儿，就必然会使婴儿的生长发育不佳，营养不良。但是，目前有些炼乳制造商们却常常在自己的制品上写着炼乳“为代替母乳之无上珍品，因此哺喂婴儿定能发育健全，体壮身肥”（百鸽牌炼乳）；甚至说炼乳“用之以哺儿，确能代替母乳……经化学家证明其滋长力与人乳无异……。婴儿食之强健非常，发育亦速，诚为育儿优良之出品”（三羊炼乳）。显然这种宣传是虚伪的；特别是对于一般育儿知识较少的家长来说，这种宣传的危害性就更大了。当然，把炼乳作为一种一般食品而出售是可以的；但是不应该有这种虚伪的宣传。希望炼乳制造商们今后在制品上对炼乳的用途作实事求是的说明，并标明它是不适于婴儿长期食用的。
    中央卫生部的意见
    中央人民政府卫生部来信：一般炼乳在制造过程中，加入了很高成分的蔗糖（往往在百分之四十以上），因而稀释成可用之乳汁时，所含脂肪及蛋白质的成分就非常低，不能满足婴儿营养的需要。虽然这种食品比较容易消化，甚至可使食用者体重增加；但用作婴儿的主要食品是不相宜的，决不能与无糖蒸发乳同样看待。如果婴儿长期食用炼乳，必致肌肉松弛、软弱而缺乏抵抗力，并易得各种维生素缺乏症如佝偻病等。因此，我们同意读者田祖恩的意见。为了保障第二代的健康，我们建议工商行政管理部门教育炼乳制造商，凡炼乳有虚伪欺骗的宣传标记者，应一律加以修正。
