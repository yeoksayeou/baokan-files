Letters from the 12th and 9th Groups of the Chengzi Mine, Jingxi Mining Bureau

Letter from all the workers of the 12th and 9th Groups of the Chengzi Mine, Jingxi Mining Bureau: The letter from the Ma Liuhai and Lian Wanlu rapid tunneling groups of the Datong Coal Mine challenging fraternal tunneling groups (teams) across the country on increasing production and practicing economy has greatly inspired all employees of the Chengzi Mine, Jingxi Mining Bureau. All workers in our 9th and 12th groups are full of confidence and willing to accept their challenge. Last year, we went to the Datong Coal Mine to learn the advanced working methods of the Ma Liuhai group, and after returning, we promoted them within the mine for the first time, achieving great results. Now, based on our existing work, and according to the specific conditions of our mine, we have formulated a plan for increasing production and practicing economy in the fourth quarter of this year as the terms of our challenge. We eagerly hope to continuously encourage each other in the future, improve technology and operation methods, and complete and overfulfill the glorious task assigned to coal mine workers by the state this year, and lay the foundation for producing more raw coal in 1954.

The 12th group's challenge conditions are: Guarantee a monthly tunneling progress of 500 meters (the existing coal seam thickness is 1.3 to 1.8 meters), which is 248 meters higher than the national plan, and strive for 550 meters. Guarantee a monthly output increase of 1,130 tons compared to the national plan. Guarantee a saving of two firecrackers and two detonators per meter of tunneling, and make full use of waste materials to save 5.4 million yuan per month. Guarantee the elimination of all personal accidents.

The 9th group's challenge conditions are: Under the conditions of more rock and less coal (coal seam thickness 0.4 meters to 1.3 meters), achieve a monthly tunneling progress of 315 meters, which is 100 meters higher than the national plan; save two firecrackers per meter of tunneling. Eliminate all work-related injuries.

In order to achieve the above conditions, our two groups have decided to take the following measures:

One, Consolidate and improve the achievements of learning from Ma Liuhai's advanced experience in multi-hole cycle tunneling. Use the single-eye slotting and cracking method for drilling and blasting, and load explosives during the hollow blasting stage. Use pneumatic picks and give full play to their role to greatly reduce the consumption of explosives.

Two, Learn and continue to study the deep-hole operation method, increasing it from 2.2 meters to 2.5 meters.

Three, The various types of work in the group should have a clear division of labor, and mutual guarantee conditions should be established. Operate in strict accordance with the regular cycle chart, and each shift should guarantee three rounds of blasting to achieve balanced production.

Four, Conscientiously implement safety regulations and operating procedures, and strictly implement the shift handover system to ensure that the roadway meets specifications and the quality meets standards.

Five, Strictly implement the rotation system, and never be absent from work without a valid reason. Ensure that the number of staff reaches 100 percent of the established quota.

Six, Before the No. 46 inclined slope is repaired, in order to overcome the difficulty of transporting timber to the working face, ensure that everyone carries a piece of timber on their back during work hours to ensure the supply of timber required for the working face.

Seven, Sign contracts with the administrative department to ensure that production is not affected by problems with tools, ventilation, transportation, and maintenance.

    京西矿务局城子矿第十二组、第九组来信
    京西矿务局城子矿第十二组、第九组全体工人来信：大同煤矿马六孩、连万禄快速掘进组关于增产节约向全国各兄弟矿掘进组（队）挑战的来信在人民日报上发表后，有力地鼓舞了我们京西矿务局城子矿的全体职工。我们第九组和第十二组全体工人都充满信心地愿向他们应战。去年我们曾到大同煤矿学习马六孩组的先进工作方法，回来后第一次在矿内推广，获得了很大的成绩。现在，我们在现有的工作基础上，根据本矿的具体条件，订出了今年第四季度的增产节约计划作为应战条件。我们热望在今后不断互相鼓励，提高技术和改进操作方法，完成并超额地完成今年国家给我们煤矿职工的光荣任务。并为一九五四年生产更多的原煤打下基础。
    第十二组的应战条件是：保证每月掘进五百公尺（现有煤层厚度为一点三至一点八公尺），较国家计划提高二百四十八公尺，争取掘进五百五十公尺。保证月产量较国家计划提高一千一百三十吨。保证掘进每公尺节省两个火药和两个雷管，并尽量利用废料，每月节约五百四十万元。保证消灭一切人身事故。
    第九组的应战条件是：在多岩少煤的条件下（煤层厚度零点四公尺至一点三公尺）作到每月掘进三百一十五公尺，较国家计划提高一百公尺；每掘进一公尺节约二个火药。消灭一切工伤事故。
    为实现上述条件，我们两组决定采取以下措施：
    一、巩固和提高学习马六孩多孔道循环掘进先进经验的成绩。打眼放炮使用独眼拉槽龟裂法，在空心爆破阶段装药。使用风镐，并发挥它的作用，大量减低火药消耗。
    二、学习并继续研究深空作业法，由二点二公尺提高到二点五公尺。
    三、小组各工种明确分工，并订出互相保证条件，认真按照正规循环图表作业进行操作，每小班保证打三茬炮，达到均衡生产。
    四、认真执行保安规程和操作规程，并严格执行交接班制度，保证巷道合规格，质量合标准。
    五、严格执行轮休制度，绝不无故旷工。定员人数保证达到百分之百。
    六、在四十六号斜坡修好前，为了克服向工作面运木材的困难，保证在上班时每人背一根木材，以保证供应工作面需用的木材。
    七、和行政互订合同，保证不因工具、通风、运输、检修等出漏子而影响生产。
