    Northeast China's Factories, Mines, and Transportation Enterprises Plan to Increase Production and Practice Economy by Four Trillion Yuan
    Enterprises Launch Competitions Centered on Improving Business Management
    [Our Dispatch] State-owned industrial enterprises, local state-owned industrial enterprises, and transportation enterprises in Northeast China have all formulated specific plans for increasing production and practicing economy, and launched mass campaigns for increasing production and practicing economy. As of now, state-owned industrial enterprises across the region plan to increase production and practice economy for the state by a total of over 2.4 trillion yuan this year. The main product increase plans are as follows: 320,000 tons of raw coal, 14,000 tons of gasoline, 110,000 tons of pig iron, 36,000 tons of steel ingots, 60,000 tons of steel, 560 tons of electrolytic copper, over 200 tons each of electrolytic zinc and electrolytic lead, 80,000 tons of cement, 4,500 bales of cotton yarn, 100,000 bolts of cotton cloth, and 19,000 automobile tires. Local state-owned industrial enterprises also plan to increase production and practice economy for the state by over 600 billion yuan. Railway, postal and telecommunications, highway and other transportation enterprises plan to increase production and practice economy for the state by about 1 trillion yuan. In addition, basic construction units have also put forward specific plans. Currently, the widespread and in-depth development of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, comprehensively overfulfilling this year's national plan, and preparing for next year's production and basic construction have become the overriding central tasks in Northeast China. To achieve the requirements of increasing production and practicing economy, Northeast China has decided to take the following important measures in industrial and mining enterprises and the transportation industry:
    First, all enterprises must increase production and practice economy on the basis of existing planned management and the establishment of a responsibility system, and continue to strengthen planned management and various responsibility systems. Therefore, all factories and mining enterprises should, in accordance with the state-approved plan and the requirements of increasing production and practicing economy, combined with the specific circumstances of their subordinate units, compile monthly, ten-day, and daily work plans for enterprises, workshops, and pitheads, and formulate technical measures plans, equipment maintenance plans, and raw materials, fuel, and power supply plans that are adapted to the work plans. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the original records and basic statistics work of factories and mines and workshops in order to improve quota management and improve cost and financial management. In addition, we should earnestly prepare for the next period's production, and prevent tendencies that disrupt normal production procedures. Second, increasing production and practicing economy must be combined with strengthening technical management to ensure product quality and production safety. To this end, it is necessary to strictly implement product quality standards and operating technical standards, strengthen the product quality inspection responsibility system, revise technical operating procedures, and constantly educate workers to strictly abide by operating procedures to reduce personal and equipment accidents, improve quality, reduce waste products, and save raw materials. Third, to avoid generalizing the approach to increasing production and practicing economy, each enterprise system must analyze the specific situation of its own unit, combine it with the promotion of advanced experience, and propose different key issues, and then formulate specific implementation measures plans for increasing production and practicing economy accordingly. For example, the non-ferrous metal system should mainly focus on safe production and improving efficiency (including rock drilling and recycling); the coal mine system should continue to focus on tunneling, improving coal mining methods, adjusting the labor force, and improving labor organization; the power system should mainly focus on ensuring safe power supply, burning low-quality coal for power generation, and increasing hydropower generation; the machinery industry should mainly focus on doing a good job in new product trial production and organizing balanced production. All factories and mines should further grasp and solve the key problems of their own units in order to improve and increase output, quality, and production management level. Fourth, under the conditions of available raw materials and sales channels, equipment capacity should be fully utilized, and necessary equipment should be adjusted and supplemented. All enterprises should do a good job in equipment maintenance, establish a regular maintenance system for machinery and equipment, and ensure that maintenance is carried out according to plan and the quality of maintenance is guaranteed. Fifth, consolidate labor discipline and improve worker attendance. Strengthen education for employees, improve their class consciousness and conscious discipline, and care for the lives and welfare of employees; Sixth, the leading cadres of many enterprises pay more attention to increasing production targets, but have not paid due attention to the savings of raw materials, fuel, and power, the planned supply, the timely sale of products, the clearing of funds occupied by creditor's rights and debts, and the reduction of various fund backlogs. Therefore, in increasing production and practicing economy, it is necessary to earnestly combine it with improving the business management of enterprises and vigorously improving financial management in order to further reduce product costs and save funds.
    In order to smoothly achieve the above requirements, the main cadres of each administration bureau must quickly go deep into the factories and mines, paying special attention to the units with weak work. Factory directors (especially production factory directors) and staff members of various sections must go deep into workshops, pitheads, and even work sections and groups to specifically help analyze the situation, study methods, and solve specific problems; and they must also earnestly reduce the unnecessary meetings, documents, tables, reports, and other burdens of grassroots units below the factory and mine level, so that the leading cadres and technicians of factories, mines, and workshops can devote themselves to leading production and improving production management.
    In terms of basic construction, in order to implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, first, it is necessary to vigorously promote advanced experience, speed up project progress, and reduce project costs on the premise of ensuring project quality. The progress of basic construction projects in the entire region should strive to reach 85% to 90% of the annual plan by the end of October, that is, the average daily construction progress should reach about 1%. It is required that North Manchuria complete outdoor operations and connect heating before mid-October, and South Manchuria complete outdoor operations by the end of October, so that indoor operations can continue in November to complete the annual project. To this end, it is necessary to mobilize all employees to carry out labor competitions, universally set the goals of work sections and groups to complete the plan on time or ahead of schedule, and supervise and inspect on a daily and ten-day basis to ensure completion. Second, continue to strengthen planned management, mainly to implement construction operation plans, improve and consolidate the responsibility system, and vigorously promote advanced experience. At present, we should mainly promote the segmented parallel assembly line operation method and various advanced experiences of plasterers, plumbing workers, and electromechanical installation workers. Third, earnestly strengthen technical supply work. Quickly allocate and transport various plumbing, electromechanical equipment, and materials, and deploy workers in trades such as plasterers, plumbing workers, and electromechanical installation workers. Overcome the departmentalism of various units, and rationally adjust surplus or insufficient resources to vigorously support units with difficulties or weak work. In addition, for completed units, in addition to the relevant parties earnestly implementing the project acceptance system, attention should also be paid to financial settlement, as well as the recovery and maintenance of remaining materials, machinery and equipment, and construction tools; labor should be rationally organized and new tasks should be assigned in a timely manner to prevent all possible waste and losses.
    In order to achieve the above-mentioned measures for increasing production and practicing economy, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party and political work, so that the ideological mobilization and propaganda and education of increasing production and practicing economy can penetrate into all enterprises and units and into all employees and the broad masses; give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of Party and non-Party masses. After the action plan is determined, inspections should be continuously organized to correctly implement the Party's guidelines and policies, support advanced creations and suggestions, strengthen weak links, and overcome specific difficulties in the work.

    东北全区各厂矿、交通运输等企业
    计划增产节约四万亿元
    各企业以改善经营管理为中心展开竞赛
    【本报讯】东北全区国营工业、地方国营工业各厂矿、交通运输业等，都已制订了增产节约的具体计划，开展了群众性的增产节约竞赛。到目前为止，全区国营工业今年计划为国家增产、节约共计两万四千余亿元，主要产品增产计划为：原煤三十二万吨，汽油一万四千吨，生铁十一万吨，钢锭三万六千吨，钢材六万吨，电铜五百六十吨，电铅、电锌各二百余吨，水泥八万吨，棉纱四千五百件，棉布十万疋，汽车外胎一万九千只。地方国营工业也计划为国家增产节约六千余亿元。铁路、邮电、公路等运输企业，计划为国家增产节约一万亿元左右。此外，基本建设各单位也提出了具体计划。目前，广泛深入地开展增产节约竞赛，全面地超额完成今年国家计划，并做好明年生产与基本建设的准备工作，已成为东北区压倒一切的中心任务。为实现增产节约的要求，东北区决定在各工矿企业和交通运输业中采取以下几项重要措施：
    第一，各企业必须在已有的计划管理与建立责任制的基础上进行增产节约，并继续加强计划管理与各种责任制。因此，各厂矿企业都应根据国家批准的计划与增产节约的要求，结合所属各单位的具体情况，编制企业、车间、坑口的月、旬、日作业计划，并制订与作业计划相适应的技术措施计划、设备检修计划、原材料、燃料、电力供应等计划。同时，必须加强厂矿、车间的原始记录和基层统计工作，以便改进定额管理和健全成本财务管理。此外，并应认真做好下期的生产准备工作，防止破坏正常生产程序的偏向。第二、增产节约必须与加强技术管理相结合，保证产品质量与生产安全。为此，必须严格贯彻产品质量标准和作业技术标准，加强产品质量检查责任制，并修订技术操作规程，经常教育工人严格遵守操作规程，以减少人身和设备事故，提高质量，减少废品和节约原材料。第三、避免对增产节约的一般化的做法，各企业系统必须分析本单位的具体情况，结合推广先进经验，分别提出不同的关键性问题，再据此制订增产节约的具体执行措施计划。如有色金属系统主要应掌握安全生产与提高效率（包括凿岩与回收）；煤矿系统主要应继续抓紧掘进，改进采煤方法，调整劳动力，改善劳动组织；电业系统主要应做好安全供电，燃烧劣煤发电与增发水电；机械工业主要应做好新产品试制工作与组织均衡生产。各厂矿都应再进一步掌握与解决本单位的关键性的问题，以改进和提高产量、质量与生产管理水平。第四、在有原材料、有销路的条件下，应充分发挥设备能力，并调整与补充必要的设备。一切企业均应做好设备的维护与检修工作，建立经常性的机械设备的维护与检修制度，保证按计划检修及检修的质量。第五、巩固劳动纪律，提高工人出勤率。加强对职工的教育，提高其阶级觉悟和自觉的纪律性，并关心职工生活福利；第六、许多企业的领导干部对于增加产量的指标都比较重视，但对原材料、燃料动力的节省与有计划的供应、及时推销产品、清理债权债务占用的资金，以及减少各项资金积压的情况，还没有加以应有的重视。因此，在增产节约中必须认真结合改进企业的经营管理工作，大力改进财务经理工作，以进一步降低产品成本和节约资金。
    为顺利实现以上要求，各管理局主要干部必须迅速深入厂矿，特别注意工作薄弱的单位。厂矿长（特别是生产厂矿长）以及科室人员，必须深入车间、坑口直至工段班组，具体帮助分析情况，研究办法，解决具体问题；并须认真减少厂矿以下基层单位不必要的会议、文件、表报、报告等负担，以便使厂矿、车间、坑口的领导干部和技术人员能全力领导生产，改进生产管理。
    在基本建设方面，为贯彻增产节约的精神，第一、必须在保证工程质量的前提下，大力推广先进经验，加快工程进度，降低工程成本。全区基本建设工程进度，十月底要努力争取达到全年计划的百分之八十五到百分之九十，即每日施工进度平均要达百分之一左右。要求作到北满在十月半以前、南满在十月底以前完成室外作业，接通暖气，以便在十一月份继续室内作业，完成全年工程。为此，要动员全体职工开展劳动竞赛，普遍订出工段、班组按期或提前完成计划的奋斗目标，按日按旬督促、检查，保证完成。第二、继续加强计划管理，主要是贯彻施工作业计划，健全与巩固责任制，大力推广先进经验，目前主要应推广分段平行流水作业法以及抹灰工、水暖工、机电安装工的各种先进经验。第三、认真加强技术供应工作。迅速调拨与运输各种水暖、机电设备器材，调配抹灰工、水暖工、机电安装工等工种工人，克服各单位的本位主义，多余或不足的要合理调剂，大力支援有困难的或工作薄弱的单位。此外，对已竣工的单位，除由有关方面认真执行工程验收制度外，并应注意财务结算，以及剩余材料、机械设备、施工器具的回收与维护工作；劳动力要合理组织，及时分配新的任务，防止一切可能发生的浪费损失。
    为了实现上述增产节约的各种措施，必须加强党的领导与政治工作，使增产节约的思想动员与宣传教育，深入到各个企业单位，深入到全体职工与广大群众中去；充分发挥党与非党群众的积极性与创造性。在行动计划确定后，即应不断组织检查，借以正确贯彻党的方针、政策，支持先进的创造与建议，加强薄弱环节，克服工作中的具体困难。
