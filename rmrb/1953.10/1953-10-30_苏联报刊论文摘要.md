    Improving Commerce, Reducing Circulation Costs
    The "Izvestia" published an article by P. Bekov, Director of the Finance Bureau of the Molotov Oblast Soviet of Working People's Deputies, on September 8th, discussing the improvement of local commercial work. The abstract is as follows:
    Due to the further development of consumer goods production and the upswing in agriculture, it has become particularly important to comprehensively expand commodity circulation and improve the work of state-owned, cooperative, and collective farm trade. Soviet commercial organizations should be familiar with the needs of residents and deliver the growing stream of consumer goods to consumers in a timely manner.
    However, the experience of Molotov Oblast indicates that the commercial situation in our oblast is far from meeting this requirement.
    Molotov Oblast has failed to fulfill its commodity circulation plan for many years, and the commodity circulation plan for the first half of this year was also not fulfilled. This cannot be excused by a shortage of goods in warehouses, especially not by a lack of demand from residents. In our oblast, the phenomenon of stockpiled goods and goods stored in stacks and warehouses is commonplace. By the middle of this year, the value of excess inventory in the trade organizations of our oblast had reached a huge figure of several hundred million rubles.
    The main reason for the stockpiling of goods and the failure to fulfill the commodity circulation plan is the poor organization of trade. For example, among the stockpiled goods, there are many that can find a market in our oblast. The worst thing is that some goods are often piled up in warehouses for no reason, or they are blindly transported to some cities and districts without considering the needs of residents.
    The basic operational level of our trade is also very low. At the counters, you often encounter rude and neglectful salespeople who do not consider it necessary to talk to customers or tell them the advantages of the goods. In some local stores, goods are often piled up "like mountains," buried in dust, or damaged beyond recognition, so that even the least picky customers refuse them. Most commonly, some district and village consumer cooperative stores open or close at the convenience of the staff, completely ignoring the interests of customers.
    The sluggishness, mismanagement, and lack of careful calculation on the part of the leaders of the commercial organizations in our oblast have cost the state dearly. They have failed to fulfill the plans for capital accumulation and profit submission, and have tolerated large overspending on commodity circulation costs and so-called "unplanned losses."
    Commodity circulation costs refer to the expenses incurred in delivering finished goods to consumers. The faster the goods reach the consumers, the lower the commodity circulation costs. But our work in this area is still very poor.
    The joint consumer cooperative of the oblast is slow to learn about the uneven distribution of goods, and often only knows about the situation after the local authorities raise their concerns. The repeated transportation of goods between districts increases transportation costs, increases commodity circulation costs, delays the sale of goods, and increases unreasonable expenses. At the same time, excess inventory freezes the working capital. As a result, some trade organizations lose their solvency and have to borrow from banks.
    In order to sell goods quickly and reduce commodity circulation costs, it is necessary to constantly study the needs of residents and supply the planned consumer goods in a timely manner. When allocating goods, it should be done precisely in accordance with the shipping orders, which must be based on the actual demand for goods in these or those cities or districts.
    Shops in some districts and large villages located near railways or highways should have goods delivered directly from the oblast's warehouses, without going through the district's warehouses. This will reduce the time it takes for goods to reach consumers and reduce various handling fees. At the same time, it can enable district and village stores that have their own accounts in the National Bank to better utilize their working capital.
    Self-flow and unplanned phenomena should not be allowed in commercial work. Local Soviets should conduct regular supervision and planned guidance of this very important work.
    In order to lead correctly, it is necessary to be familiar with the business.
    The "Labor Daily" published an editorial on September 25th, elaborating on the importance of economic workers and trade union workers constantly improving their production and business knowledge. The abstract is as follows:
    Among economic workers and trade union workers, the Communist Party has cultivated and trained many experienced cadres who can fully master their own business and successfully complete the tasks they face. Among the leaders of our enterprises, there are more and more experts who are familiar with technology and production economics, and who are also capable organizers who work with a true sense of ownership. At present, it is rare for someone without an engineering education to lead a factory.
    Now, as our enterprises are equipped with new machines and factory employees are completing increasingly complex tasks, the requirements for economic and trade union workers are also greatly increased. In order to lead correctly, it is necessary to be familiar with the business - this is a definite rule. Production commanders must be fully familiar with the machines and technical operating procedures of their enterprises, and deeply study the economy, otherwise, work achievements will be inconceivable.
    The vast majority of production leaders and trade union workers in our country can successfully undertake the work entrusted to them. However, there are also some leaders who do not have enough knowledge, do not study production issues well, and make many mistakes in their work. This is the reason why we still have some backward enterprises that consistently fail to meet the state plan.
    But some people have the view that trade union work is nothing special, and does not require specialized knowledge and training. This is an incorrect view. If trade union workers only have a superficial understanding of production and economic issues, how can they correctly lead production competitions? In this case, how can they correctly organize production meetings and discuss truly pressing issues at the meetings? Of course not! Trade union workers must be familiar with production, be proficient in economics and labor law.
    Unfortunately, some trade union leaders clearly disregard these requirements. Bureaucracy in resolving labor disputes can only be explained by ignorance of labor law. For example, recently, several labor dispute cases occurred at the Tula Motor Vehicle Station, which belongs to the "All-Union Commercial Transportation" Trust, most of which were caused by the administration and the local trade union committee not being familiar with labor law. In addition, a lack of understanding of the foundations of trade union work often leads to the crude violation of the democratic system of the trade union.
    Study! Study tenaciously - this is the requirement made to every economic worker and trade union leader.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    改进商业，降低周转费
    “消息报”九月八日刊载了苏联莫洛托夫州劳动
    人民代表苏维埃执行委员会财政局局长普·贝柯夫论
    改进地方商业工作的论文，摘要如下：
    由于消费品生产的进一步发展和农业的高涨，全面开展商品流通，改进国营、合作社和集体农庄贸易的工作已变得特别重要。苏维埃的商业机构应当熟悉居民的需求，并把增长着的源源不绝的消费品，及时地送达消费者手中。
    但是莫洛托夫州的经验指出，本州商业情况还远不能满足这个要求。
    莫洛托夫州许多年来都没有完成商品流通计划，今年上半年的商品流通计划也没有完成。这绝不能用仓库缺货，尤其不能用居民没有需求来辩解。在我们州里，积压商品和货物在堆栈和仓库中堆存的现象已是司空见惯。到本年年中，本州各贸易机构中超过定额的存货其价值已达数亿卢布的巨大数字。
    积压商品和完不成商品流通计划的主要原因是没有做好贸易组织工作。例如，在积压的货物中，有不少是可以在本州找到销路的。最坏的是，一些货物常毫无理由地在仓库中堆积，或是不估计居民需求盲目地向一些城市和区里运送。
    我们贸易的基本业务水平也很低。在柜台上常会遇到粗暴和怠慢的售货员，他们认为没有必要和顾客攀谈，或是告诉他货物的优点。在一些地方商店中，货品常堆积“如山”，埋在灰尘里，或是揉损得不成样子，甚至最不挑剔的顾客都要对之谢绝。最常见的是一些区的和村的消费合作社商店竟按工作人员的方便开门或关门，完全漠视顾客的利益。
    本州商业组织领导人的迟钝、管理不善和缺乏精打细算，使国家付出了大的代价。他们没有完成资金积累和上缴利润计划，容忍商品周转费的大量超额支出和所谓“计划外的损失”。
    商品周转费乃是指把制成的商品送达消费者手中所用的花费。商品到达消费者手中愈快，商品周转费也愈低。但我们在这方面的工作还做得很差。
    州的联合消费合作社对商品分配不均匀的现象知道得很迟，而且往往是在当地提出意见后才知道这种情况。发出的货物在区与区之间的辗转运送增加了运费开支，加大了商品周转费，延迟了货物的销售，增加了不合理的开支。同时超额的存货又使周转基金被冻结。于是一些贸易机关便失掉支付能力而不得不向银行借款。
    为使货物能迅速售出，并减缩商品周转费，就必须经常研究居民的需要，并及时供应预定的消费品。在拨运货物时则应精确地依照发货单办理，这些发货单的编制必须是以这些或那些市或区对商品的实际需求为基础。
    位于铁路或公路附近的一些区的和大村庄的商店，应当不经区的仓库，迳直由州的仓库拨运货物。这样就可以减少货物运达消费者手中的时间和各项搬运杂费。同时，并可以使在国家银行中有自己帐户的区的和村的商店更好地利用自己的周转资金。
    在商业工作中不应容许有自流和无计划现象。地方苏维埃应当对这一非常重要的工作进行经常的监督和有计划的指导。
    为了正确地领导，必须熟悉业务
    “劳动报”九月二十五日发表社论，阐述经济工作人员和工会工作者不断提高生产业务知识的重要，摘要如下：
    在经济工作者和工会工作人员中，共产党培育和锻炼了不少有经验的干部能完全掌握自己的业务，并能成功地完成自己所面临的任务。在我国企业的领导者之间，熟悉技术和生产经济的专家，同时是真正以主人翁态度进行工作的有能力的组织家，已愈来愈多了。目前，没有受过工程师教育的人来领导工厂的事，已很少了。
    现在，当我国的企业装有新式机器，工厂员工们正在完成日益复杂的任务时，对经济和工会工作人员的要求也无比地提高起来。为了要正确地领导，就必须熟悉业务——这乃是一个确定不移的法则。生产指挥员必须完全熟悉本企业的机器和技术操作规程，深刻研究经济，否则，工作成就将是不可思议的。
    我国绝大多数的生产领导者和工会工作人员都能成功地担负起委托给他们的工作。但是也有一些领导人，他们没有具备足够的知识，没有好好研究生产问题，工作中的错失很多。这就是我们仍有一些一贯完不成国家计划的落后企业的原因。
    但有些人有这样的看法：工会工作没有什么了不起，不需要专门的知识和修养。这是一种不正确的观点。如果工会工作者只是肤浅地懂得生产和经济问题，他们怎能正确领导生产竞赛呢？在这种情况下，他们怎能正确地组织生产会议，并在会上讨论真正迫切的问题呢？当然不能！工会工作者必须熟悉生产，通晓经济和劳动法。
    可惜，一些工会领导人显然漠视这些要求。在解决劳动争执问题方面的官僚主义，只能用对劳动法的无知来说明。例如最近“全苏商运”托辣斯所属土拉汽车站发生了几件劳动冲突案件，其中大多数都是由于行政和地方工会委员会不熟悉劳动法所引起的。此外，不懂得工会工作的基础，时常会使工会的民主制度遭到粗暴的破坏。
    学习！顽强地学习——这就是向每一个经济工作者和工会领导人所提的要求。
