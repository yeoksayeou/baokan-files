The Transformation of Cadre Work Style in Jiangshan District, Laiyang County
Zhang Ma

Laiyang County, Shandong, which produces "Laiyang Pears," does not have pear orchards bearing sweet pears everywhere. Jiangshan District in the south of the county has low-lying terrain and often suffers from floods in summer and autumn. In the past, farmers often said that the land here was "barren nine years out of ten."

This year, before the wheat had ripened, Jiangshan District was hit by a major flood, and 30,000 mu of land immediately turned into a vast expanse of water... However, after the district cadres mobilized the masses to actively rescue the situation, all the water in the fields was drained within three days. The masses reflected, "If this flood hadn't been managed by the district leaders, many more crops would have been drowned!" As a result, Jiangshan District received a commendation from the Laiyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for the second time.

The first time Jiangshan District received a commendation was for its production and disaster relief work this spring. At that time, under the leadership and specific assistance of the county committee, the Jiangshan District Committee went deep into the masses to understand the situation, grasped the key point of Lingqian Township, learned from experience, and guided the production and disaster relief work in various townships. As a result, the entire district stopped the spring famine, prevented the summer famine, and greatly promoted production. The masses all said, "The government is really thoughtful for the people." "This year is different from previous years, the cadres are concerned about the people's affairs and are focusing on production work." The transformation of the cadre work style in Jiangshan District is the main gain of the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline in this district. So, what was the work style of the cadres in this district like before, and how did they transform it?

"The Problem is Serious!"

Jiangshan District is one of the districts in the Laiyang area that was liberated relatively late. The main cadres at the district, township, and village levels mostly joined the work after the liberation in 1945. In the past seven or eight years, these cadres have led the farmers in a series of struggles against feudal forces, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and various natural disasters. The achievements are certain. However, their style of not proceeding from reality, making a great show, and "acting in a rush" was serious. Taking 1952 as an example, in the spring, District Committee Secretary Li Ruizhong wanted to "take the initiative," so he disregarded the characteristics of "Jiangshan Depression" and blindly arranged the promotion of waterwheels. After the county committee made unified arrangements for drought resistance and prevention, it even "acted in a rush" by convening a thousand-person meeting, forcing various townships to dig wells and borrow waterwheels on a large scale for drought resistance and prevention. What was the actual effect a month later? Most of the borrowed waterwheels became "sleeping wheels," and most of the wells dug were just earthen pits. In the autumn, just when it was time for harvesting, the task of building the Qingdao-Yantai highway came, and Jiangshan District had to send 1,300 laborers every day. The Highway Bureau of the Shandong Provincial People's Government Transportation Department did not have a thorough plan for mobilizing laborers for such a huge project; the leading organs of the special zone and the county did not pay attention to it and did not send main cadres to lead it. The district committee only assigned this task to District Chief Yu Zhenhu (member of the district committee) to be responsible for alone, and did not inquire about it any further. The production problems in the laborers' homes were not properly resolved, so that many laborers were "physically away but mentally at home," and they did not work wholeheartedly. It took only seven days to transport 325 cubic meters of stones for the first time, but it took more than a month the second time. This delayed production, and many late autumn crops were not harvested in time, and many sweet potatoes rotted before they could be stored.

In January this year, the Party Central Committee issued instructions on carrying out the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline. In early February, in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions, Laiyang County convened the first conference of county, district, and township cadres. At the meeting, the county committee secretary, by summarizing the work in 1952, especially the work of digging wells, borrowing waterwheels, and quarrying stones, exposed and reviewed the county committee's serious bureaucracy and commandism in not proceeding from reality. The serious facts and the county committee's self-criticism educated every cadre who attended the meeting. Li Ruizhong, secretary of the Jiangshan District Committee, began to realize that forcing the masses to borrow waterwheels and quarry stones last year seriously damaged the interests of the masses and that his own coercive and commanding style was serious. He thought: How can such a big loss to the masses be made up for? He should be punished. But he also thought: It is right for us to be responsible for forcing the masses to borrow waterwheels, but we cannot be solely responsible for quarrying stones... Thousands of thoughts ran through his mind; he also thought that many sweet potatoes had rotted in the masses' fields, which would cause a famine, and the problem was really serious.

In the district group discussions, Li Ruizhong made a self-criticism to the district and township cadres. At the general meeting, many cadres reviewed their own commandism, and the township head of Jiudian Township in Bailong District reported his experience in patiently mobilizing the masses to dig wells. This formed a strong contrast with bureaucracy and commandism that did not care about the suffering of the masses, making everyone begin to understand what methods should be used to work. Although Li Ruizhong's fear of being punished was not resolved, he also felt that the previous work style was very bad and must be completely changed.

The Key to Success and Failure

At the enlarged cadre meeting of Jiangshan District, Li Ruizhong once again reviewed the mistakes and shortcomings in last year's work. When arranging work, District Cadre Ying Shanshan raised an opinion to Li Ruizhong: "We are just talking about changing our work style, but how is this work arrangement different from the past? What is the key to increasing production in our district? You haven't explained it." Li Ruizhong felt that what he said made sense and agreed. But what is the key to increasing production? So he thought about it, and finally he remembered the working method of Ren Guodong, secretary of the Zhaoyuan County Committee, which was to go to the masses to find out the "bottom line" of production.

Therefore, Li Ruizhong and Jiang Bojia, deputy secretary of the district committee, organized the cadres and separately convened symposiums in the villages of Lingqian Township. Li Ruizhong and Song Kekuan went to Xilinghou Village to hold a symposium for old farmers. The symposium started with the harvest of crops last year, first talking about flax, then about millet and sorghum. Li Ruizhong asked:

"What kind of millet seed is good?" Old farmer Gong Huanzhen said, "The 'Sanbianqing' millet I planted is not bad!" Someone said, "Hongsheng millet is also good." "There's also Huangxian Caogu"... Several people argued with each other. Although Li Ruizhong was a local, he joined the work after graduating from school, and he had not been working deeply in the past few years, so he didn't know that there were so many kinds of millet. If you want to lead the masses, you must first learn from the masses.

"Let's bring the millet ears for everyone to see!" At Li Ruizhong's suggestion, the old farmers immediately went home to bring the millet ears, and they also brought scales. "Let me weigh them." Gong Huanzhen took the scales and weighed the various millet ears separately. Sanbianqing millet weighed 1 liang and 1.7 qian per ear, Hongsheng millet weighed 1 liang per ear, Huangxian Caogu... These ears that were weighed were all the biggest ones that were picked. If they were medium-sized ears, Sanbianqing millet would weigh 4.5 qian per ear, and Huangxian Caogu would weigh 4 qian per ear. In the face of facts, everyone affirmed that the "Sanbianqing" millet seed was good.

"How many millet plants are planted per mu?" Gong Huanzhen estimated and said, "About 40,000 millet plants per old mu (equivalent to 2 city mu)!" 40,000 plants, 4.5 qian per plant, more than 1,100 jin per old mu! "Ah!" Everyone was very surprised! Wang Guanglin, who had experience in growing millet, said, "It's impossible. My millet is not bad, but I didn't even get half of that."

"What's going on?" Several people looked for the reason, one saying, "The crops are planted too roughly, there are too few seedlings, and there are broken rows." Someone said, "There are also diseases and insect pests. Taking 'gun stalks' (white hair disease) as an example, at least 30 out of 100 plants have it. Even if we count 10 out of 100 plants, there are 4,000 plants per old mu." Everyone said in unison, "The yield is reduced a lot!" Li Ruizhong and Song Kekuan also felt for the first time the severity of the damage caused by diseases and insect pests to crops.

What to do? Everyone believed that seeds must be soaked, and seedlings must be even and full. Even and full seedlings require two rounds of thinning. The first round is to keep dense seedlings, and the second round is to remove diseased and small plants. In addition, some "listener seedlings" should be left on the edges of the fields, and they should be used to replant where there are missing seedlings.

The symposium continued, and several old farmers talked enthusiastically about good varieties of sorghum, good varieties of sweet potatoes, and how to increase production. They talked for a long time. Finally, they all suddenly realized and said, "It turns out that planting crops is not just about applying fertilizer, you also have to have a set of methods! In the past, we just talked about increasing production, and we didn't think much about methods."

Because there was no experience in this symposium, the number of plants per mu of crops was not calculated accurately, but Li Ruizhong had indeed learned some ways to increase production from the old farmers' conversations, and he had also practiced the mass line once. However, Li Ruizhong therefore regarded the matter of establishing a correct ideological work style as too easy. He thought that he had learned the methods of increasing production and could pass them on to the masses. As a result, Li Ruizhong hit a big nail. The next night, Li Ruizhong and others held a symposium for old farmers in Jiangshan Town. At the beginning of the meeting, they introduced methods of increasing production to the old farmers, weighing ears, calculating yield, checking the number of plants... They were very busy, but the old farmers who were called in sat there blankly watching the excitement, and some whispered, not believing it. Later, Li Ruizhong realized that this approach was not right, but it was too late, and the symposium ended without results. At this time, Li Ruizhong recalled the scene of the old farmers' enthusiastic debate and calculation at yesterday's symposium, which was not forced at all. Success and failure formed a contrast in his mind, making him more deeply understand a truth: violating the principle of the masses' conscious and voluntary participation will cause dissatisfaction among the masses, and all work will fail.

The four cadres who participated in the symposium returned and reviewed the mistake of taking over everything. They also took out the newspaper with the article "Ren Guodong, winner of the Gold Star Medal," and studied it repeatedly until late at night.

After learning the lesson, Li Ruizhong, secretary of the district committee, again led the district cadres to convene a meeting of party members and youth league members in the five villages of Jiangshan Town. By enlightening everyone's consciousness and using methods such as weighing ears, calculating output, and checking the number of plants, he implemented the guidance of production technology. This meeting was very enthusiastic and successful. Everyone reflected, "This year, the leaders' guidance on production is really different from the past," "Using facts to educate people really solves problems."

The cadres of various villages in Jiangshan Town learned from the experience of the meeting of party members and youth league members in the five villages and separately convened mutual aid groups and electoral district meetings to implement it. The use of improved varieties, seed soaking, and other advanced methods was quickly promoted in Jiangshan Town.

Li Ruizhong convened a meeting of district cadres, reported the success and failure of the three symposiums, and pointed out that the key to success and failure lies in whether or not to patiently enlighten and educate the masses and carry out work through the masses' conscious participation. Finally, he called on everyone to use small-scale symposiums and use facts to enlighten and educate the masses to implement the guidance of production technology.

Learned the Correct Working Method

Although Jiangshan District had two consecutive years of good harvests after 1950, it suffered a heavy blow from the looting by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in 1947 - 608 people were killed in the entire district, and grain, clothing, farm implements, and livestock were looted. Therefore, it was not easy to restore the vitality of the masses for a while. In particular, the lives of widowers, widows, orphans, and the elderly were even more difficult. This spring, under the instructions of the higher-level party committee, the Jiangshan District Committee decided to make production and disaster relief the central work of the entire district. Under the unified leadership of the party committee, all departments in the district unified and organized their forces and grasped the work at three key points. Li Ruizhong personally grasped Lingqian Key Point Township.

Although no one formally expressed opinions on the practice of serving production and disaster relief and unifying the organization of forces, some people were discussing it. Song Kekuan, the civil affairs assistant of the District People's Government, asked Deputy District Chief Li Zhensong: "Is it okay not to leave anyone in the office?" Based on past experience, Li replied, "What's okay? If the county government needs materials and we can't send them, they'll point their noses at us and scold us!" Asked, "What should we do?" Answered, "What can we do!" The district's cooperative also clamored, "We can't do business work." But facts will prove everything.

Li Ruizhong went to Lingqian Key Point Township, first divided the work with the party branch committee in the township, and then the district cadres went to the masses to find out the situation. Li Ruizhong and Jiang Bojia went to the homes of Ma Yangshi in Donglinghou Village and Gong Zhangshi in Xilinghou Village. Both families had only one lonely old person, and their lives were very difficult. When Gong Zhangshi saw the cadres coming to express their condolences, they told about their son being brutally killed by the Kuomintang homecoming corps. The two district committee secretaries felt very sad after hearing this. In the evening, the district cadres at the key point reported the situation to the township party branch with the same heavy heart, and the township and village cadres were also greatly educated. They jointly studied ways to provide relief to 15 households in difficulty. When distributing relief grain, they first convened a meeting of households in difficulty to specifically help them plan production. On the one hand, this directly linked disaster relief with production, avoiding waste; on the other hand, it could also verify the amount of relief money. It was originally decided to provide 150,000 yuan of relief to Ma Mingzhi's family. After the meeting planned it, only 40,000 to 50,000 yuan was enough for relief. At the same time, the district cadres continued to go deep into households in difficulty to investigate and understand the situation and ranked the households in difficulty. The situation of households in difficulty in Lingqian Township was quickly grasped, and the relief funds were distributed in a timely manner.

At this time, Liang County Chief of Laiyang County came with a work team to help with the work, and the cadres and the masses were greatly encouraged. After listening to the report, County Chief Liang instructed: We should mobilize the masses to plant more early-maturing grains and vegetables to prevent summer famine. One night, after Li Ruizhong reported the work of the third-category township to County Chief Liang, who was also a member of the county committee, he said, "I have a question." The county chief said kindly, "Tell me about it!" Li Ruizhong spoke in one breath about the "series of mistakes he made in his work last year, and that he would be punished if he made any more mistakes" which had been on his mind for a long time. The county chief smiled and said to him gently: "Last year, many cadres were transferred from this district in the second half of the year. There were many things and a lot of loose ends, and there were certain objective reasons for the problems. Of course, the district committee is responsible for last year's problems, but the county committee is mainly responsible. The county committee has also exchanged opinions and cannot punish you. Your work has always been active, but there are some problems with your work style. The important thing is that you must change your work style and do your job well in the future." County Chief Liang also talked with him for a long time. These words were like a good medicine, curing Li Ruizhong's ideological illness.

From then on, Li Ruizhong worked even more actively and led the masses in Lingqian Township to carry out the production and disaster relief movement. For households in difficulty with labor, the mutual aid group helped to solve the difficulties. Ma Mingyue's family in Donglinghou Village had five people and an ox, and they encountered difficulties in the spring. Ma Mingyue was so worried that he had no intention of producing. The mutual aid group helped him plan: First, help him sell the wood that he didn't need for the time being, buy sweet potato jerky to feed his family, and borrow some fodder to feed the cattle. The old lady looked after the children at home, his wife went to herd cattle, and they planted some pumpkins, peanuts, and small vegetables to overcome the difficulties. In this way, Ma Mingyue's difficulties were resolved, and the whole family was very happy. For households with no labor, under the slogan of "close neighbors help each other to do a good job in production," methods such as separate planting and contract planting were used to plant the land in a timely manner. In addition, the district cadres also addressed the ideological concerns of wealthy households in lending and proposed the slogan of "borrowing and repaying," and carried out free lending among the masses.

After Jiangshan District gained experience at the key point, it adopted two methods to promote it: one was to "pull it back," and the other was to "jump out." "Pull it back" meant that the district committee, based on the situation and experience of the key point township, convened district cadres working in various townships to check their work and provide specific guidance. At the first meeting, the district committee called on various townships to learn from the experience of Lingqian Township and first clarify the real situation. Sure enough, with a model, there was a way, and most townships quickly grasped the disaster situation. Then the district committee used the second method of "jumping out," and district cadres from the key point township went to various townships to check and guide the work. Li Ruizhong went to Sandu Township and found that the relief work in this township was not done well. In the evening, he convened a meeting of township and village cadres. Before the meeting, Li Ruizhong thought: How should I talk to the township cadres, scold them, or use facts to educate them? He couldn't help but recall an past event. Last autumn, he came to inspect the work of catching insects. At that time, when he saw that this township was not doing well, he was furious and immediately convened a meeting of cadres and gave them a big scolding. Township Branch Secretary Xiao Lixian made a self-criticism and immediately ordered three villages to eliminate insect pests in three days, forcing everyone to make plans on the spot. Now, he must change this work style. The meeting began, and Li Ruizhong first listened to the reports of the village cadres. Everyone talked about the same old situations. Li Ruizhong asked, "Have you discovered any new households in difficulty?" Zhang Zhongxiu, branch secretary of Zhongsanduhe Village, said, "Our village guarantees that there are none." Li Ruizhong calmly presented the situation he had learned to everyone. The scene deeply moved everyone. Township Branch Secretary Xiao Lixian thought: The district committee secretary's work style has really changed, and we should do the same. This time, Xiao Lixian sincerely made a self-criticism. Then everyone made a detailed study and division of labor and went down to the villages.

The change in the work style of the district cadres set a living example for the township and village cadres. The ideological consciousness of the township and village cadres gradually improved, and their work style also began to change. Xiao Lixian was responsible for grasping the situation of the sixth electoral district of Xisanduhe Village. He visited six households in a row and helped the masses plan everything from production to food and clothing. Gao Qingyun, branch secretary of Dongsanduhe, didn't take a nap for several days in a row, talking to the masses everywhere, and distributed the first relief fund based on the actual situation. The masses reflected, "This time, the relief fund was distributed fairly." Gao Qingyun said with emotion, "The earlier work was really done blindly. The superiors said to provide relief, and several cadres held a meeting and decided on it."

The transformation of the work style of township and village cadres in Jiangshan District was not in one or two townships, but in most villages and townships! Once, Jiangshan Town held a symposium for military dependents to discuss the issue of relief. At the beginning of the meeting, military dependent Su Shirong (women's representative) emphasized that she had difficulties, but everyone knew that her family was raising a pair of fat pigs and had recently bought a big donkey. Su Changtai, the village branch secretary of the fifth village who presided over the meeting, became impatient and sarcastically said to her, "I'm also going to buy a big donkey, anyway, I can't make it difficult!" As a result, the meeting did not produce any results. The military dependents did not go to the meeting again the next day. Su Yutian, the general branch secretary of Jiangshan Town, was very worried. He thought: If Su Shirong's problem is not solved, this work will not be able to be carried out. But everyone is a cadre, and Su Shirong is older than him, so what should he do? The more he thought about it, the more difficult it became, but he also thought of the county and district cadres sent by the superiors to help with the work. These people's work style has changed, and they work so patiently and so deeply. Why shouldn't he learn from them! So Su Yutian went to find Su Shirong. After exchanging a few pleasantries, Su Yutian said, "Sister, doesn't everyone have big difficulties, small difficulties, and no difficulties in the spring! Sister-in-law is not at home, so our family's plan for earning a living is not easy to plan." Su Shirong took over and said, "Yes, Yutian, I like to hear you say that. That day at the meeting, Changtai provoked me to sell the donkey as soon as he opened his mouth, and I got angry!" Asked, "Do you have any opinions on that day's meeting?" Answered, "It doesn't matter whether I get relief or not, but I don't agree with unfair relief." Su Yutian saw that the problem was out in the open, and he immediately said, "Sister, you are right. We cadres are responsible for the unfair relief in the past. Now we must change our work style and handle things fairly. I'll give you an example of who gets relief and who doesn't. Let's say we have three people who all have difficulties, but I have the most difficulties; the government gives 30,000 yuan. If the three of us divide it equally, no one will solve a big problem. If you give it all to me, my difficulties will be solved, and you two can overcome it." Su Shirong listened and said, "Yes, if you don't have difficulties, you have to secretly buy something to eat with the relief money." Su Yutian proposed a way to solve the problem of livestock fodder for Su Shirong, step by step. Su Shirong was very happy when she heard this. She said, "Yutian, let's do it this way!" When the military dependents' symposium was held again, Su Yutian first asked Su Shirong to report her plan. Everyone listened and said, "Yes!" They also made detailed plans. Finally, among the 31 military dependents, seven households who needed relief were democratically selected, and the relief funds were distributed immediately, and everyone was very satisfied.

In production and disaster relief, Jiangshan District also strengthened the guidance of agricultural production technology to farmers. Therefore, 70% of the households in the entire district were able to change varieties and soak seeds, and they all sowed in a timely manner. Before sowing, farmers plowed the land one inch deeper than last year. When the crops grew out, the farmers said happily, "Crops have never grown so well in generations!" All kinds of crops grew lush and green, which was really pleasing.

A Severe Test

On the night of May 27, it rained. Although the rain was not too heavy, it came very quickly. The cadres of the key point township couldn't sleep because they were worried about the rain damaging the crops. The next morning, someone ran to the west of the village to see if the crops had been damaged. They were relieved when they saw that the crops had not been damaged. But as soon as they came back, Ma Tongdeng, secretary of the Youth League branch of Donglinghou Village, ran to report: "The water on the southeast slope is full!" Suddenly, people became nervous: "So many good seedlings on the full slope, isn't that terrible?" "It didn't rain that much, where did the water come from?" Li Ruizhong immediately went to the east of the village with district cadres Ying Shanshan and Sun Tongli. From a distance, they saw a white expanse of water in the wheat field. The three of them turned to the west of the village to see the high-yielding land. At this time, Song Kekuan ran to find them breathlessly and said, "The water on the east slope and south slope is high, half a trough deep!" Li Ruizhong thought: We should quickly organize the masses to drain the water to protect the wheat and autumn seedlings. So Li Ruizhong led everyone to divide the work to understand the water situation and lead the drainage.

Old District Chief Yu Zhenhu and Song Kekuan went to Lingqian Village and, together with Deputy Township Head Li Changjing, yelled at a group of people to drain the water. A foot-long opening had been made in the river bank. But the water was too strong, and the opening could not be filled. What should we do? Song Kekuan came up with a way: first build a semi-circular small dam around the breach to block the water for a while, and then block it inside. The experiment was successful.

In order to understand the water situation, Li Ruizhong, Ying Shanshan, and Sun Tongli braved the flood and went south towards Lijiazhuang. The water on the south slope of Lijiazhuang was very high, and the villagers all said that the township head had seen it and "couldn't do anything about it." Li Ruizhong sent Sun Tongli to find the township head to mobilize the masses, and he and Ying Shanshan and others went to the south slope first. When they arrived at the river, there were several breaches. Before the masses had arrived, Ying Shanshan saw that two places on the river bank were about to collapse, so he jumped into the water and used his hands to block the river bank that was about to collapse. At this time, Song Kekuan also came. He saw at a glance that the river bank of Zhangjiazhuang on the opposite side of the river had also been breached, and the flood was pouring into the fields, and the fruits of the farmers' hard work were about to be swallowed by the flood. He braved the chest-high water to cross the river to Zhangjiazhuang to mobilize the masses to block the breach. The masses in Zhangjiazhuang were very moved and quickly gathered to repair the breach.

When the district cadres who had led the masses to drain the water returned to Lingqian Township, it was already three or four o'clock in the afternoon. Fighting against the flood had made everyone forget that they had not eaten all day. The water situation in the entire district had been basically understood, and the source of the water - the various breaches in the river bank - had also been found, and the breaches had been blocked, and more than 10,000 mu of land had been drained. Even so, the farmers still had many ideological concerns, especially some elderly people who said, "We haven't seen such a big flood in decades, we can't drain it!" In the evening, Jiang Bojia led the cadres of the key point township to convene small-scale mass meetings. Jiang Bojia started by empathizing with the suffering of the masses and emphasized that the grain that was already in their mouths must not be taken away by the flood. With the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, everyone would definitely be able to drain the water and take back the grain. In this way, the morale of the vast majority of the masses was raised, and the next day, all the young and middle-aged people in the township went to the slope to dig ditches and drain water. The village cadres of Xilinghou Village, which was not flooded, also led the masses of their village to support the eastern village.

On the 29th, the district committee held a meeting to systematically study the water situation and analyze the thoughts of cadres and the masses. Everyone believed that the reason why the masses' thoughts were fluctuating was because the masses did not know how to drain the water. As long as we can lead the masses to drain the flood and rescue the crops, the morale of the masses will stabilize. In the evening, the key point township convened a meeting of old farmers to study the drainage problem. The old farmers proposed that if the district committee wanted to drain the water, it had to lead everyone to take unified action. Jiang Bojia accepted this opinion on behalf of the district committee. Then everyone talked about how the flood should be drained. The consensus was: first block the breaches and then drain the water accumulated in the fields, uniformly dredge the channels from top to bottom, open the upper channels and do not block the lower ones. Divert water from basin-shaped land into small ditches, small ditches follow the water into large rivers, small pieces of water are drained separately, and large pieces of water are organized by neighbors to drain. If there are any opinions during drainage, everyone can discuss and resolve them. When talking about what to do if the seedlings are drowned, everyone said they could transplant seedlings. More than 20 years ago, old farmer Liu Tingfu transplanted two mu of sorghum when he worked for the landlord, and it grew very well, yielding ten bags per two old mu. Wang Shuchun also transplanted millet last year, and it grew well. Sorghum can be replanted, and if there are no seedlings, flax can be replanted.

After the district committee led everyone to discuss the solution, they divided the work to lead the drainage in various townships. Jiang Bojia went to Zhangjiazhuang in the south, Li Ruizhong and Song Kekuan went to Lishuangzhuang in the east again, and Ying Shanshan stayed in Donglinghou Village. At this time, the county committee also instructed that Jiangshan District should take drainage as the current urgent task. The county committee's organization minister, agricultural committee secretary, and deputy director of the county cooperative union were sent to help with the work.

The farmers in Jiangshan District knew the benefits of drainage, but because they had observed the old rules of "not opening the upper channel and not blocking the lower channel" for generations (that is, if the water is in your field, you are not allowed to let it out, and if the water flows into my field, I am not allowed to block it), they had never drained the water well. Now they had to change this old rule. There was a piece of water in the southeast of "Laoyingqian" in Village Three of Jiangshan Town, which was high on all sides and low in the middle. Some people remembered the old rules and said, "This pond of water can't be drained." Xiu Keyi, the district committee's organization committee member, heard about it and ran to the field and turned around this piece of land several times. Finally, he found a way: as long as he dug a ditch in one piece of land, the water could be drained out. He went to find the village branch secretary, Chi Fengzhu. Chi Fengzhu said, "This piece of land belongs to Chi Zhongxun, so let's mobilize him first." Chi Zhongxun refused when he heard that he was going to dig a ditch in his land. The next day, the water from this hundred-plus mu of basin-shaped land was drained. The water from the four hundred mu of basin-shaped land in the southeast of "Sanmu San", Houziwan (place name), and Liquanzhuang in Donglinghou Village was drained in this way. "The basin was broken and the water flowed away, thanks to the Jiangshan District Committee!" "This is really a good thing that has never happened in Jiangshan District!" The farmers praised the work of the district committee happily.

After three days of intense fighting, the flood was completely drained. Jiangshan District then convened an enlarged district cadre meeting, township and village branch meetings, and mutual aid group meetings. It summarized and compared the progress from the Party to the outside and from top to bottom and praised the models who actively led the drainage. Chi Mingzu, member of the general branch of Lingqian Township, and Li Wenren, secretary of the branch of Lingqian Village, both made self-criticisms comparing their failure to actively lead the masses to drain the flood. After the meeting, the township and village cadres became more active. They led the masses to transplant seedlings, cultivate, and rotate planting. They also re-inspected and repaired dangerous projects. Each village also established flood prevention organizations to closely protect their crops.

× × ×

"The work style of the cadres in Jiangshan District has changed." This is a conclusion summarized by the masses from many specific facts. But this is only a good start. The leading cadres in Jiangshan District know that the change in the work style of some cadres is not conscious enough, and the development of democracy inside and outside the Party and the development of criticism and self-criticism are not sufficient. Therefore, we must continue to work hard to improve our work style and our working methods.

    莱阳县姜山区干部作风的转变
    张马
    出产“莱阳梨”的山东莱阳县，并不是到处都有结着甘美梨子的梨树林。县南部的姜山区，地势低洼，夏天和秋天，常闹水灾。过去农民常说这里的地是“十年九不收”。
    今年，麦子还没成熟，姜山区就来了大水，三万亩土地，立即变成了一片汪洋……但是经区干部发动群众积极抢救，三天就把地里的水全部排出去了。群众反映：“这场水不是区里领导着放，涝死庄稼就多了！”因此，姜山区第二次受到中共莱阳县委的表扬。
    姜山区第一次受到表扬，是今春的生产救灾工作。当时姜山区区委在县委的领导和具体帮助下，深入群众了解情况，掌握岭前乡基点，摸出经验，指导各乡生产救灾工作。于是全区制止了春荒，预防了夏荒，大大地推动了生产。群众都说：“政府给老百姓打算的真周到。”“今年不同于往年，干部对群众的事关心了，对生产工作抓紧了。”姜山区干部作风的转变，是这个区开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪斗争的主要收获。那么，以前这个区的干部的作风怎样、他们又是怎样转变的呢？
    “问题严重！”
    姜山区是莱阳专区中解放较晚的一个区。区、乡、村的主要干部，大都是一九四五年解放后参加工作的。七八年来这些干部领导着农民向封建势力、向蒋匪帮和各种自然灾害进行了一系列的斗争，成绩是肯定的。但是他们不善于从实际出发、大捶大擂、“大呼隆”的作风是严重的。以一九五二年为例，春天，区委书记李瑞忠想“争取主动”，就不顾“姜山洼”的特点，盲目地布置推广水车。县委统一布置抗旱防旱后，更“大呼隆”地召开千人大会，强迫各乡大量打井、贷水车抗旱防旱。一个月后，全区贷出水车一百零五部，打井二百来眼。实际效果如何呢？贷的水车大部分成了“睡车”，打的井大部分是土坑。秋天，正当收割的时候，又来了修筑青（岛）烟（台）公路的任务，姜山区每天要出一千三百个民工。对于这样巨大的工程，山东省人民政府交通厅公路局却没有周密的动用民工计划；专区和县的领导机关也没有予以重视，没有派主要干部去领导。区委也只把这项任务分给区长于振湖（区委委员）一人负责，再没有过问。对于民工家里的生产问题，没有妥善解决，使得不少民工“人在外，心在家”，没心作活，同样运三百二十五方石子，第一次只用七天，而第二次就运了一个多月。这样就耽误了生产，不少晚秋庄稼没来得及收割，不少地瓜没来得及收藏霉烂了。
    今年一月，党中央发出了关于开展反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪斗争的指示。二月初，莱阳县依照中央指示的精神，召开了第一次县、区、乡三级干部会议。会上县委书记通过总结一九五二年的工作，特别是打井、贷水车、打石子等工作，揭发与检讨了县委不从实际出发的严重官僚主义与命令主义。严重的事实与县委的自我检讨教育了参加会议的每一个干部。姜山区区委书记李瑞忠开始认识到去年强迫群众贷水车、打石子是严重地损害了群众利益，自己强迫命令作风的严重。他想：给群众造成这样大的损失怎么弥补呢？应该受处分。但他又想：强迫群众贷水车的事情要我们负责是应该的，但是打石子就不能光让我们负责……脑子里千头万绪；又想到：群众烂了不少地瓜，就会造成灾荒，问题实在严重。
    各区分组讨论，李瑞忠向区乡干部作了检讨。大会发言时，不少干部检讨了自己的强迫命令作风，白龙区旧店乡乡长报告了耐心发动群众打井的经验，这与不关心群众疾苦的官僚主义、命令主义形成了强烈的对比，使大家开始懂得应该用什么方法去工作。李瑞忠怕受处分的思想虽然没有解决，但也感到过去的工作作风很坏，必须彻底转变。
    　成功和失败的关键
    在姜山区的扩大干部会议上，李瑞忠就去年工作中的错误和缺点，再次作了检讨。布置工作时，区干部应时珊向李瑞忠提出了一个意见：“咱们光说转变作风，可是这回布置工作与过去有什么不同呢？咱区的增产关键究竟是什么？都没有交代。”李瑞忠觉得他说得有道理，表示同意。但增产关键是什么呢？于是他思索起来，最后想起了肇源县县委书记任国栋的工作方法，要到群众中去摸生产的“底”。
    于是，李瑞忠和区委副书记姜泊甲把干部组织了一下，分头在岭前乡的各村召集座谈会。李瑞忠和宋克宽到西岭后村召开老农座谈会。座谈会是从去年庄稼的收成开始谈起的，先说到胡麻，又说到谷子和高粱。李瑞忠问：
    “什么谷种好呢？”老农宫焕珍说：“我种的三遍青谷就不孬！”有人说：“红绳谷也不错”“还有黄县草谷”……几个人各不相让。李瑞忠虽然是本地人，可是从学校出来就参加了工作，几年来工作又不深入，就不知道谷子还有这么多种。真是要领导群众，就得先向群众学习。
    “把谷穗拿来大家看看吧！”李瑞忠一提议，老农们马上回家把谷穗拿来了，秤也捎来了。“我来称称。”宫焕珍接过秤来，把各种谷穗分别称称。三遍青谷一穗重一两一钱七，红绳谷每穗重一两，黄县草谷……。称的这些穗头都是挑得最大的，如果是中等穗，三遍青谷每穗也重四钱半，黄县草谷每穗重四钱。大家在事实面前都肯定了“三遍青”谷种好。
    “一亩地种多少棵谷？”宫焕珍约摸着说：“一老亩（合二市亩）照着四万棵谷算吧！”四万棵，一棵四钱半，一老亩打一千一百多斤！“啊！”大家很惊讶！种谷有经验的王光林说：“打不了，我的谷不错了，连一半也没打上。”
    “怎么回事呢？”几个人找原因，你一言，我一语，有的说：庄稼种的太粗拉，缺苗，断条。有的说：还有病虫害，光拿“枪杆”（白发病）一项来说吧，一百棵里少说也有三十棵，就按一百棵十棵算，一老亩就四千棵。大家异口同声地说：“减产‘老鼻子’啦！”李瑞忠和宋可宽也是头一次感到病虫害对庄稼侵害的严重。
    怎么办呢？大家都认为必须浸种、齐苗、全苗。齐苗、全苗要两遍定苗，头一遍密留苗，第二遍去病株、小株。另外在地头上留些“听差苗”，那里缺苗，那里用它们去栽补。
    座谈继续着，几位老农热烈地谈着高粱的良种，地瓜的良种，怎么增产，一谈谈了一大晌。最后都恍然大悟地说：“原来种庄稼光上粪不行，还得有一套办法！以前咱光说增产，就没有多想办法。”
    这次座谈由于没有经验，每亩庄稼的棵数计算得不准确，不过李瑞忠确已从老农谈话中摸到了一些增产的门路，并作了一次走群众路线的实习。但是李瑞忠却因此把树立正确思想作风的事情看得太容易了。他以为已经学到了增产的方法，可以向群众传授了。结果，李瑞忠碰了一个大钉子。第二天晚上，李瑞忠等在姜山镇召开老农座谈会，会议一开始，他们就向老农们介绍增产方法，秤穗头、算棵数……忙得不亦乐乎，召集来的老农却呆呆地坐在旁边看热闹，有的小声唧咕着，不相信。后来李瑞忠发现这种作法不对头，可是已晚了，座谈会无结果而散。这时，李瑞忠就回忆起昨天座谈会上老农们热烈地争论和计算的情形，真是半点也不勉强。成功和失败在他脑子里形成对比，使他较深切地懂得了一条真理：违反群众自觉自愿原则，就会引起群众不满，一切工作就会失败。
    参加座谈会的四个干部回来，就检讨起包办代替的错误，他们又把登着“金星奖章获得者——任国栋”的报纸拿出来，反覆地学习，一直到深夜。
    接受了教训之后，区委书记李瑞忠再次领导着区干部在姜山镇五村召开党团员会议，通过启发大家自觉，用秤穗头、算产量、查棵数的办法，贯彻了生产技术指导。这次会议开得很热烈很成功。大家反映：“今年上级领导生产真和往年不同了”，“用事实教育人，真解决问题”。
    姜山镇各村干部学习了五村党团员会议的经验，分头召集互助组和选区会议进行贯彻。选用优良品种、浸种等先进方法很快地在姜山镇推广了。
    李瑞忠召开区干部会议，报告了三个座谈会的成功、失败的经过，并指出成功失败的关键就在于能否耐心地启发教育群众，通过群众自觉进行工作。最后号召大家要通过小型座谈会，用事实启发教育群众，以贯彻生产技术的指导。
    　学会了正确的工作方法
    姜山区虽在一九五○年以后连着收成了两年，但因一九四七年遭受了蒋匪帮的洗劫——全区被杀六百零八人，粮食、衣物、农具和牲口被抢劫一空，创伤很重，因此群众的元气一时不易恢复。特别是鳏寡孤独户的生活更困难。今年春天，姜山区委在上级党委的指示下，决定以生产救灾为全区的中心工作。在党委统一领导下，全区各部门统一组织了力量，分三个基点掌握工作，李瑞忠亲自掌握岭前基点乡。
    对一切服务于生产救灾和统一组织力量的作法，虽然没人正式提出意见，但却有人在议论。区人民政府民政助理员宋克宽问副区长李振松：“机关里不留什么人行吗？”李根据过去的经验回答：“行什么，县政府要材料送不上，该指着咱们鼻子‘熊’啦！”问：“怎么办？”答：“有什么办法呢！”区的合作社也嚷嚷着：“业务工作没法搞了。”但是事实是会来证明一切的。
    李瑞忠到岭前乡基点，先和乡里党总支委员分了工，之后，区干部就分头深入群众摸情况。李瑞忠和姜泊甲一起到东岭后村麻杨氏家和西岭后村宫张氏家，两家都只有一位孤独的老人，生活很困难。宫张氏一见干部来慰问，便诉说她儿子被国民党还乡团残杀的情形，两位区委书记听了非常难过。晚上，基点的区干部怀着同样沉重的心情，向乡党总支汇报了情况，乡干部、村干部也受到很大教育。他们共同研究对十五户困难户进行救济的办法。发放救济粮时，先召集困难户开会，具体帮助他们打谱生产。这一方面使救灾与生产直接联系起来，避免浪费；一面还可对证救济的钱数。本来决定救济麻明智家十五万元，经过会议打谱，只救济四、五万元就够了。同时区干部继续深入困难户，调查了解情况，并将困难户进行排队。岭前乡困难户的情况很快掌握了，救济款也及时发放下去了。
    这时，莱阳县梁县长带着工作队来帮助工作，干部、群众受到了很大鼓舞。听取汇报后，梁县长指示：应该发动群众多种早熟粮菜，预防夏荒。一天晚上，李瑞忠向兼任县委委员的梁县长汇报三类乡工作以后说：“我有一个问题。”县长亲切地说：“你说说吧！”李瑞忠一口气把在脑子里想了好久的“去年工作中犯了一系列错误，再犯一点错误就会受处分”的顾虑说出来。县长笑了笑，温和地对他说：“去年下半年这个区调走很多干部，事情多，头绪乱，出问题有一定的客观原因。去年的问题区委当然要负责，主要的还是县委负责。县委也交换过意见，不能给你处分，你工作一贯积极，只是作风上有些问题，要紧的是今后必须转变作风作好工作。”梁县长又和他谈了很长时间，这些话像一付良药，医治了李瑞忠的思想病。
    从此，李瑞忠更加积极工作了，在岭前乡领导群众开展了生产救灾运动。对有劳力的困难户，通过互助组帮助打谱解决困难。东岭后村麻明月家有五口人，一头牛，春天就发生了困难，麻明月愁的没心生产。互助组就帮助他打谱：先帮他把暂时用不着的木料卖了，买地瓜干糊口，又借一部分草料给他喂牛，老太太在家看孩子，老婆去放牛，再种些方瓜、地豆、小菜渡困难。这样，麻明月的困难解决了，全家都很高兴。对没劳力户在“亲邻相助搞好生产”的口号下，采用分种、包种等办法及时种上了地。此外，区干部还针对着富裕户在借贷问题上的思想顾虑，提出了“有借有还”的口号，在群众中开展了自由借贷。
    姜山区在基点取得了经验之后，便采用两种办法来推广：一是“拉回来”，二是“跳出去”。“拉回来”是区委依据基点乡情况和经验，召开在各乡工作的区干部检查工作，进行具体指导。第一次会上，区委号召各乡要学习岭前乡的经验，首先把真实情况弄清楚。果然，有了样子就有了办法，大多数乡的灾情很快掌握起来了。接着区委又运用了第二种办法“跳出去”，基点乡区干部到各乡检查工作、指导工作。李瑞忠到三都乡发现这个乡的救济工作作得很不好。晚上，召集乡、村干部会议。会前，李瑞忠寻思着：怎样向乡干部讲呢，训斥他们，还是摆出事实来教育他们呢？不由的记起一件往事，去年秋天他来检查捕虫工作。当时，一见这乡作得不好，就火气冲天，马上召集起干部开会，大训一通。乡总支书记萧理贤作了检讨，并马上命令三个村三天消灭虫害，逼大家当场作出计划。现在呢，要转变这种作风了。开会了，李瑞忠首先听取了各村干部的汇报，大家讲来讲去还是些老情况。李瑞忠钉了一句：“发现新的困难户没有？”中三都河村分支书记张中秀说：“我村保证没有。”李瑞忠平静地把他所了解的情况向大家摆了出来，这些情景深深地感动大家，乡总支书记萧理贤想：区委书记的作风真是转变了，咱也应该这样作。这回，萧理贤诚心诚意地作了检讨。接着大家作了详细研究、分工，就都下去了。
    区干部作风的转变，给乡、村干部树立了活的榜样，乡、村干部思想觉悟逐步提高，作风也开始转变了。萧理贤负责掌握西三都河村六选区情况，他一连访问了六户，从生产到吃用，都帮助群众作了打算。东三都河分支书记高清云接连好些天不歇晌，到处找群众谈话，并根据实际情况发放了第一次救济款。群众反映：“这回救济款发的公平。”高清云感慨地说：“早先的工作真是瞎干，上级说要救济，几个干部开个会，就决定了。”
    姜山区乡、村干部作风转变，不是一乡或两乡，大部分乡村都有转变！有一回，姜山镇开军属座谈会讨论救济问题，会议一开始，军属苏世荣（妇女代表）就强调自己有困难，但是谁不知道她家里喂着一对肥猪，新近又买了一头大驴。主持会议的五村支部书记苏长泰听了就发了急，讽刺了她一句：“我也去买大驴，反正作不了难！”这一来，会议没开出结果来。第二天再召集会，军属都不去了。姜山镇总支书记苏玉田很发愁，他想：苏世荣的问题不解决，这工作搞不下去。可是大家都是干部，苏世荣又比自己年长，怎么办？越想越觉得不好办，可是他又想到上级派到镇上来帮助工作的县、区干部，这些人作风转变了，工作起来那么耐心，那么深入，自己怎么不应该学习学习呢！于是苏玉田去找苏世荣。坐下来叙了两句家常，苏玉田就说：“大姐，春天各家大困难小困难还有不困难的吗！大姐夫又不在家，咱家打算营生也不好打算。”苏世荣接过来说：“是呵，玉田，你说这话我爱听。那天开会，长泰一张嘴就激着我卖驴，我生气啦！”问：“你对那天的会有什么意见吗？”答：“没有什么，救济不救济没有什么，救济不公可不同意。”苏玉田见问题摊出来了，就紧跟着说：“大姐，你说的对，过去救济不公咱当干部的都有责任，现在咱们就要改变作风，把事办公平。救济谁不救济谁，我打一个比方：咱们有三个人都有困难，可是我最困难；公家给三万元，如果咱三人平分，谁也没解决多大问题，要是都给我一人，我的困难解决了，你们两人抗抗也能过去。”苏世荣听了说：“是呵，不困难，拿着救济款上集买嘴吃也得偷偷摸摸的。”苏玉田一步紧跟一步地给苏世荣提出了解决牲口缺草料的办法。苏世荣一听很高兴，她说：“玉田，就这么办！”再开军属座谈会时，苏玉田先让苏世荣报告了自己的打谱计划。大家一听，对！也都具体打了长谱。最后在三十一户军属中，民主评定出七户需要救济的，救济款紧跟着发放下去，大家都很满意。
    在生产救灾中，姜山区还加强了对农民生产技术指导。因此，全区有百分之七十的户数作到换种、浸种，普遍作到适时播种。播种前，农民耕地都比去年深耕一寸。庄稼长出来了，农民都高兴地说：“多少辈子庄稼也没有长得这样齐全！”各种庄稼长得绿油油的，真惹人欢喜。
    严重的考验
    五月二十七日的夜晚，下了一场雨。雨虽不太大，可是来得很急。基点乡的干部因此睡不着觉，耽心着急雨冲坏庄稼。第二天一早，就有人跑到村西去探望，见到没有冲坏庄稼，才放下心来。可是一回来，东岭后村团支部书记麻同登跑来报告：“东南坡水满啦！”顿时，人们紧张起来：“满坡多么好的小苗，这不糟了吗？”“没下多大的雨，水是从那里来的呢？”李瑞忠当即和区干部应时珊、孙桐礼一起去村东，远远就看见麦地里白茫茫地一片大水，三个人又转到村西去看丰产地。这时宋克宽跑得气喘喘地来找他们，说：“东坡、南坡水大啦，有半槽子深！”李瑞忠想：应当赶快组织群众排水，保卫麦子和秋苗。于是李瑞忠领导大家分工下去了解水情和领导排水。
    老区长于振湖和宋克宽到岭前村，和副乡长李昌景，吆唤着一群人去排水。河堤开了丈八长的口子。但是水太猛了，口子填不住。怎么办？宋克宽想出了一个办法：在决口外围先打一道半圆小坝，先挡一下水，然后再在里面堵。一试验，果然行通了。
    为了摸清水情，李瑞忠和应时珊、孙桐礼?着大水向南面李家庄方向去了。李家庄南坡水很大，村里人都说乡长去看过，“没法治”。李瑞忠派孙桐礼去找乡长发动群众，他和应时珊等先到南坡去了。到河上一看，决口有好几处。在群众还没有来到的时候，应时珊看到河堤有两处就要塌下来，便跳到水里去用手堵住快要塌的河堤。这时，宋克宽也来了，他一眼看到河对面的张家庄河堤也已决口，大水正向地里灌，农民辛劳的果实快要被大水吞没，就冒着齐胸大水，渡河到张家庄去动员群众堵口。张家庄的群众非常感动，很快集合起来修补好决口。
    分头领导群众放水的区干部回到岭前乡的时候，已是下午三、四点钟，因为和大水作战使大家忘记了一天没有吃饭。全区的水情已基本上了解了，水的来源——河堤的各决口也找到了，而且已堵住了决口，大水已渗下去一万多亩。虽然如此，农民的思想顾虑还是很多，特别是有些老年人说：“这么大的水，几十年来都没有见过，放不出去！”晚上，姜泊甲领导基点乡干部召开小型的群众会。姜泊甲从体贴群众疾苦说起，强调指出决不能叫已到嘴边的粮食，让水抢走，有共产党和人民政府领导，大家一定可以把水排出去，把粮食夺回来。这样，绝大部分群众的情绪高了，第二天全乡的青壮年都上坡挖沟排水。没发水的西岭后村的村干部也带领着本村群众到东村去支援。
    二十九日区委召开会议，较系统地研究了水情，分析了干部和群众的思想。大家认为群众思想所以波动，这是因为群众不知道排水的办法，只要我们能领导群众排除大水，抢救庄稼，群众情绪会稳定下来的。晚上，基点乡召开了老农会，研究排水问题。老农提出了要放水，区委就要把大家领导起来，统一行动。姜泊甲代表区委接受了这个意见。接着大家就谈大水究竟应该怎么放？综合起大家的意见是：先堵决口后排地阡积水，由上而下统一疏渠，上开下不堵。盆洼地引水入小沟，小沟顺水入大河，小片水分散排，大片水由地邻组织起来排。排水中有意见大家商量解决。谈到涝死小苗怎么办？大家都说可以栽苗。二十多年前，老农刘廷甫给地主扛活时栽过二亩糁子，长得很好，二老亩打了十口袋。王树春去年栽的谷子，也长得不错，高粱可以补种，没苗的可以改种葫麻。
    区委领导大家讨论出办法后，分工到各乡领导排水，姜泊甲到南面张家庄，李瑞忠、宋克宽再到东面李双庄、应时珊留在东岭后村。这时，县委也指示姜山区应以排水为当前的紧急任务。并派县委组织部长、农委书记、县合作社总社副主任来具体帮助工作。
    姜山区的农民是知道排水好处的，但因辈辈遵守着“上不开、下不挡”的老规矩（这就是说水在你地里你就不许向外放，水流到我地里我也不许挡），一直没有很好地排过水。现在就要改变这个旧规矩。姜山镇三村东南“老营前”有一片水，四面高，中间洼。有些群众想起了老规矩就说：“这洼水就没法放。”区委组织委员修克义听说后，就跑到地里，围着这片地转了好几转，最后找到门道：只要在一块地里挖道沟，水就可以放出去。他去找村支部书记，村支部书记迟凤珠说：“这块地是迟中训的，先去动员动员他。”迟中训听了要在他地里挖沟，一口回说“可以”。第二天这一百多亩盆洼地的水就放出去了。东岭后村东南的“三亩三”、猴子湾（地名）和李权庄四百多亩盆洼的水都这样放出去了。“砸了盆流了水，幸亏姜山分区委！”“这真是姜山区从来没有的好事情！”农民们高兴地赞扬着区委的工作。
    经过三天紧张战斗，大水全部排出去了，姜山区紧接着召开了扩大区干部会、乡、村支部会、互助组会，从党内到党外，自上而下进行了总结和评比，表扬了积极领导排水的模范。岭前乡总支委员迟明祖、岭前村支部书记李文仁都对比检讨了自己没有积极领导群众排水的错误。会议开过之后，各乡、村干部更积极起来了，一面领导群众栽苗、修锄、转种；一面重新检查、修补险工，各村并普遍建立起防汛组织，紧紧保卫着自己的庄稼。
    　　　×　　×　　×
    姜山区“干部作风转变了”，这是群众从很多具体事实中概括起来的结论。但这只是一个良好的开端，姜山区领导干部知道，有些干部作风的转变还不够自觉，党内外民主的发扬和批评自我批评的开展还不充分。因此还要继续努力改进自己的作风，改进自己的工作方法。
