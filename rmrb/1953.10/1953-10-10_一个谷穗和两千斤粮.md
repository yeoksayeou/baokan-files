    One Grain Ear and Two Thousand Jin of Grain
    By our reporter Lu Sheng
    "Who cares about one grain ear!"
    Five days before National Day, a light rain fell on the Jinzhong Plain. After the rain, the sky cleared, the air was cool, and the ripe crops emitted bursts of fragrance. The harvest season had arrived.
    Zhang Shuanbao, the director of the South Shahe Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Taigu County, Shanxi Province, led his production team leaders from this cornfield to that sorghum field, and from that sorghum field to this millet field, carefully observing the degree of ripeness of the crops. When they observed the last field, everyone said: The crops are all ripe and we should quickly mobilize all the members to harvest. A simple mobilization meeting was held in the evening, dividing all forty-odd laborers in the cooperative into four production teams. They sharpened their sickles overnight, and before dawn the next day, all the members, led by the production team leaders, entered the cornfields. The cooperative planted a total of twenty-one mu, four fen, and six li of corn. In less than a day, all the corn was laid down in the fields, and the corn ears were carried to the threshing ground. Under the slogan of "harvest quickly, thresh quickly, distribute quickly," the corn cobs were divided by share and by weight to each member's home by the second day.
    A bountiful harvest most easily deceives people. Everyone only paid attention to "quick," but forgot the accidental loss of grain. That afternoon, district cadre Zhang Duokui and agricultural production cooperative cadre Zhao Laiyi returned from a meeting in the county. Passing by the threshing ground, they saw the whole field of golden corn kernels unattended. Before the harvest, they had conveyed the instructions of "increase production, practice strict economy," and had also proposed to the farmers the call to "harvest carefully, thresh carefully, and strive to harvest more grain," but as soon as the harvest began, people forgot everything. In the evening, the district cadres raised the issue of wasting corn to everyone. Not to mention the members, even cooperative director Guo Shuanbao said:
    "The big and good ones have been divided, who cares about half a corn kernel!"
    Farmers act according to facts. The next day, each production team went to the millet fields to cut millet. Zhang Duokui and Zhao Laiyi, however, took brooms to sweep the corn on the threshing ground. They quickly swept up a large pile, which weighed forty-two jin on the scale. After carrying the corn back, they went to the millet fields to see. The members were all very enthusiastic, cutting forward with great energy. But no one paid attention to the large and small millet ears left behind in the cut millet fields. The district cadres picked up millet ears to show them, but the old members said: "If crops aren't lost, the five grains aren't harvested, how can a grain ear not be lost!" The members also said:
    "Who cares about one grain ear!" A girl named Yuan Gaize, who lived next door to Zhang Shuanbao, saw this and quickly went home to get a basket to pick up the millet ears. When they finished cutting one mu of millet and turned back to look, Yuan Gaize had already filled a basket with millet ears, estimating that it could yield at least five or six jin of millet. The Fourth Team cut millet on the edge of the wall, and their enthusiasm was no weaker than that of the First Team. The men cut in front, and the women cut the millet ears behind. Zhao Laiyi selected one and a half fen of millet straw and picked up a bundle of millet ears, threshing one jin and six li of millet at home.
    In the evening, most of the members knew about the loss of grain due to rough harvesting. The First Team leader said: "We cut one mu of millet, and Yuan Gaize picked up five or six jin." The Fourth Team leader Bai Maolin said: "We lost one jin and six li of millet in one and a half fen of land, don't you think that's nine jin lost per mu?" Member Bai Houxiao also said: "I turned over the sorghum stalks in four mu of sorghum fields and carried back a bundle of sorghum ears, which can yield at least one dou of sorghum." Zhang Duokui and Zhao Laiyi also took out the corn they had swept back and said: "Look, this is what you call 'half a corn kernel' swept up, no more, no less, exactly forty-two jin."
    Faced with the ironclad facts of the lost corn, sorghum, and millet, from the director to every member, no one said again: "Who cares about this one grain ear." Everyone unanimously proposed: "We must carefully calculate the accounts."
    "A careful calculation reveals that almost a thousand jin of grain was lost"
    After such a twist, the call for "harvest carefully, thresh carefully, and return every grain to the house" was accepted by the cooperative's cadres. The district cadres stationed in the cooperative and all the cooperative committee members and production team leaders began to calculate the accounts carefully overnight.
    The cooperative planted a total of twenty-one mu, four fen, and six li of cornfields. Not counting what was lost in the fields, just the "half a corn kernel" swept up on the threshing ground was forty-two jin, an average loss of two jin per mu.
    The cooperative planted a total of seventy-five mu, four fen, and four li of millet fields, both large and small. According to the inspection of one and a half fen of land losing one jin and six li of millet, one mu of land would lose nine jin. Not counting the odd amounts, seventy-five mu of land would lose six hundred and seventy-five jin of millet.
    The cooperative planted a total of seventy-four mu, six fen, and five li of sorghum fields. According to the inspection of four mu of land losing one dou (equivalent to thirteen jin) of sorghum, more than two hundred and forty-two jin of grain would be lost.
    There were also broomcorn millet fields, mung bean fields, sesame fields... They carefully calculated each item, and the final total added up to a loss of one thousand jin of grain.
    Farmers can't see one grain ear, but a thousand jin of grain startled everyone. Third Team Leader Wang Liuze said: "This is not a small matter. Without calculating the accounts carefully, we didn't know. A careful calculation reveals that almost a thousand jin of grain was lost." Fourth Team Leader Bai Maolin also said: "'If crops aren't lost, the five grains aren't harvested' is what we used to say when we harvested for the landlords. Now we are harvesting for ourselves. If we lose a grain ear, we will divide a few less handfuls of millet; if we lose a corn ear, we will divide a few less kernels of corn. We can never say 'If crops aren't lost, the five grains aren't harvested' again."
    A thousand jin of grain opened everyone's minds. One person said: "This is not a small matter, a thousand jin of grain can buy a good donkey." Another person said: "A thousand jin of grain is enough for three people to eat for a year." At this time, Comrade Zhao Laiyi enlightened everyone, saying: "Our cooperative was established on a trial basis last year. Last year, because of poor management and careless work, the autumn harvest was poor, and everyone was very 'disappointed' at that time. This year, we have learned from last year's lessons, managed well, and worked carefully. In the spring, we overcame wind and frost disasters, ensuring full seedlings; in the summer, we overcame flood disasters, weeded out weeds, and did not delay crop growth; in the autumn, we overcame drought disasters, ensuring that the grains were full. Now the ripe crops are already at our mouths. Are we going to harvest carefully, thresh carefully, and return every grain to the house, striving to harvest more grain, or are we going to be careless and lose a thousand jin of grain?"
    Comrade Zhao Laiyi's words touched everyone's heart. Member Wu Wenxiu said: "Everyone think about it: How difficult is it for us to get this one grain ear! Leaving aside fertilization, plowing, and harrowing, just talking about planting a grain of millet in the soil, from its germination to its growth and ripening, we have worked hard enough! The millet seedlings emerge from the soil only as big as a needle tip, afraid of wind, afraid of frost, and afraid of drought. We worked from one leaf to two leaves, three leaves... until it ripened. Now that this grain ear is ripe, are we going to throw it away? Are we worthy of our own labor?" Finally, he proposed to quickly formulate a plan for increasing production and saving during the autumn harvest. He said: "This plan should not only carefully harvest and thresh to harvest an extra thousand jin of grain, but also apply topdressing fertilizer to late autumn crops, striving to harvest another thousand jin of grain."
    All the cooperative committee members and production team leaders agreed with this opinion, so everyone began to formulate a plan for increasing production and saving during the autumn harvest.
    Careful Harvesting, Careful Threshing, and Applying Topdressing Fertilizer to Guarantee an Increase of Two Thousand Jin of Grain
    With everyone's thinking straightened out, their energy was high. The cooperative's cadres concentrated on studying: How to achieve clean fields and threshing grounds from now on, striving to increase production by two thousand jin of grain. It was already late at night, but no one showed the slightest sign of fatigue. Finally, everyone came up with four measures:
    (1) In order to achieve "careful harvesting, careful threshing, and returning every grain to the house," in addition to mobilizing each member to harvest carefully and meticulously, four inspectors and four custodians should be added to the cooperative. The inspectors are responsible for inspecting the harvested crop fields and constantly paying attention to investigating the degree of ripeness of each millet and sorghum to ensure timely harvesting to avoid wind disasters. The custodians are responsible for ensuring that not a single grain of grain is lost when it enters the warehouse.
    (2) Pay attention to technique during harvesting. The harvested millet and sorghum should be placed lightly and thinly, and the ears should be placed neatly, which will facilitate the women to cut the ears quickly and avoid losing the ears.
    (3) The millet and sorghum pulled to the threshing ground should be well cared for, so that chickens and sparrows do not eat a single grain. The threshing should be careful and should be threshed several times to ensure that it is threshed cleanly, dried in the sun, and no grains are left behind.
    (4) Quickly repair the furniture and warehouses for storing grain, and do a good job in preventing moisture, preventing special agents, and preventing mice.
    After all four measures are implemented, when the main crops of the cooperative achieve clean fields and threshing grounds, a total of two thousand two hundred and sixty-seven jin of grain can be increased.
    Now the plan of "careful harvesting and careful threshing to strive for an extra two thousand jin of grain" has become the actual action of all the members. In the millet fields, when member Zhang Houji was pushing a small cart of millet ears towards the threshing ground, when he was walking on the road and saw a small millet ear under his feet, he quickly stopped the cart and picked it up. An old man behind him smiled and said he "can even see the small millet ear," but he said: "Hey! I dare not underestimate this small millet ear, two thousand jin of grain is accumulated from these small millet ears." On the threshing ground, several members were whipping mules to thresh bean stalks. One member said: "This is already the third threshing. In the past, one threshing would have been enough." A few days ago, the old members were still repeating an old saying: "Poor bean stalks, rich millet ears, there is dry food in wheat stalks." Now they don't dislike the bean stalks being poor anymore, because after just one threshing, there were many bean kernels under the bean stalks.
    Now no one goes to the cooperative's millet fields to pick up millet ears anymore. Because every member has recognized and believed in the fact that careful harvesting and threshing can yield more grain in their minds, they are particularly serious and careful when harvesting. The inspectors of the Fourth Team inspected the millet straw for a day and could not find a single millet ear.

    一个谷穗和两千斤粮

    “哪在乎这一个谷穗！”
    国庆节前五天，晋中平原上落了一阵小雨。雨过天晴，空气凉爽，成熟了的庄稼，发出了阵阵的香味。收获的季节到了。
    山西省太谷县南沙河村农业生产合作社主任张拴保，引着他的生产小队长们，从这块玉茭地走到那块高粱田，又从那块高粱田走到这块谷子地，细心观察庄稼成熟的程度。当他们观察到最后一块田时，大家都说：庄稼全成熟了，应该赶快动员全体社员们来收割。晚间开了个简单的动员会，把全社四十多个劳动力分成四个生产小队，连夜磨好了镰刀，第二天天还没亮，全体社员就在生产小队长的率领下进入了玉茭田。全社共种二十一亩四分六厘玉茭田，不上一天功夫就把玉茭全部放倒在地里，并把玉米穗都担到了场上。大家在“快收、快打、快分”的口号下，到第二天就按分按斤把玉米棒子分到了每个社员的家里。
    丰收最容易迷住人们的心眼。大家只注意了“快”，却忘记了粮食的意外损失。这天下午区干部张夺魁和住农业生产合作社干部赵来义从县里开会回来，路过打谷场一看，只见满场金黄色的玉米粒没人管。在收割前他们传达过“增加生产、厉行节约”的指示，也曾向农民们提出过“细收细打，争取多收粮食”的号召，但一开始收割，人们却又全忘记了。晚间区干部们把糟踏玉米的事实向大家提出来，不说社员们，连合作社主任郭拴保都说：
  “大的好的都分了，哪在乎那一半颗玉米！”
    农民行事要看事实。第二天各生产小队都到谷子地里去割谷了，张夺魁和赵来义却拿着扫帚到场上去扫玉米。他们很快扫起了一大堆，用秤一称是四十二斤。背回玉米后，他们又到谷子地里去看。社员们劲头都很大，一股劲儿向前割。但是割过去的谷地里丢下的大大小小的谷穗却没人注意。区干部拾着谷穗给他们看，老社员们却说：“庄稼不丢，五谷不收，哪还能不丢一个穗！”社员们也都说：
  “哪在乎这一个谷穗！”住在张拴保隔壁院一个名叫袁改则的姑娘看见了，连忙回家拿了筐子来拾谷穗。当他们割完一亩谷子转回头来看时，袁改则已拾满了一筐谷穗，估计至少可打五、六斤谷。四小队在墙头地割谷，他们的劲头也不比一小队弱，男人在前面割，妇女在后面切谷穗，赵来义选了一分半地的谷草就拣到一抱谷穗，回家搓了一斤六两谷。
    晚间，大部社员都知道因为收割粗糙丢掉粮食的事了。一小队长说：“我们割了一亩谷，就叫袁改则拾走了五、六斤。”四小队长白茂林说：“我们一分半地就丢了一斤六两谷，你算算还不是一亩丢九斤？”社员白候小也说：“我在四亩高粱地里翻了一下高粱秆，就扛回了一捆高粱穗，至少可打一斗高粱。”张夺魁和赵来义也把他们扫回的玉米拿出来说：“你们看，这就是你们说的‘一半颗玉米’扫起来的，不多不少四十二斤整。”
    在被丢掉的玉茭、高粱、谷子铁的事实面前，从主任到每个社员，没有一个人再说：“哪在乎这
  一个谷穗”的话了，大家一致提出：“我们可得细细算个账。”
  “一算细账才晓得几乎丢掉
      一千斤粮”
    经过这么一番曲折，“细收细打颗粒还家”的号召，合作社的干部们开始接受了。住社的区干部和全体社务委员、生产小队长们连夜算起细账来。
    全社共种二十一亩四分六厘玉茭田，地里丢掉的不算，光场上的“一半颗玉米”扫起来就是四十二斤，平均每亩田要少收二斤。
    全社共种大小谷田七十五亩四分四厘，按检查的一分半田丢掉一斤六两谷计算，一亩田就要丢掉九斤，除过零头不算，七十五亩地就要丢掉六百七十五斤谷。
    全社共种七十四亩六分五厘高粱田，按检查的四亩田丢掉一斗（合十三市斤）高粱计算，就要丢掉二百四十二斤多粮。
    还有黍子地、绿豆地、芝麻地……他们一宗一宗仔细算，算到最后加起来就要丢掉一千斤粮。
    农民对一个谷穗看不见，但是，一千斤粮就把大家吓得跳起来了。三小队队长王留则说：“这可不是个小事，不算细账不知道，一算细账才晓得几乎丢掉一千斤粮。”四小队长白茂林也说：“‘庄稼不丢五谷不收’，这是我们过去给地主收割时说的话，现在是给我们自己收割，丢掉了一个谷穗，我们就要少分几捏谷，丢掉了一个玉米穗，我们就要少分几颗玉米。‘庄稼不丢五谷不收’的话是再也不能说了。”
    一千斤粮打开了大家的脑筋。这个说：“这可不是个小事，一千斤粮能买一头好毛驴。”那个说：“一千斤粮够三个人吃一年。”这时赵来义同志启发大家说：“咱们这个社是去年试办的，去年因为经营不好，作务不周，到秋天歉收了，那时大家都很‘败兴’。今年我们接受了去年的教训，经营得好，作务得也周到，春天我们战胜了风灾霜灾，保证了全苗；夏天我们战胜了涝灾，锄净了杂草，没有误了庄稼生长；秋天我们又战胜了旱灾，保证了籽粒饱满。现在成熟的庄稼已经到嘴边了，我们是要细收细打颗粒还家，争取多收粮呢？还是要粗心大意丢掉一千斤粮呢？”
    赵来义同志的话，句句打动着每个人的心。社员武文秀说：“大家想想：我们能拿到这一个谷穗是多么不容易的呀！丢开施肥、犁、耙不说，单说把一粒谷子种到土里，从它发芽到长大结穗这一段劳动，我们是够辛苦的了！谷苗出土只有针尖那么大，怕风怕霜又怕旱，我们从一个叶作务到两个叶，三个叶……一直作务到结了穗。现在这个谷穗成熟了，我们要把它丢掉，对得住自己的劳动吗？”最后他提议迅速订个秋收增产节约计划。他说：“这个计划不光要细收细打多收一千斤粮，还要对晚秋作物多上追肥，争取再多收一千斤粮。”
    全体社务委员和生产小队长们都同意这个意见，于是大家就订起秋收增产节约计划来。
  细收细打施追肥保证增产
      两千斤粮
    大家思想通了，劲头很足。社里干部们聚精会神地研究着：如何从现在起，做到地净场光，争取再增产两千斤粮食。已经是深夜了，却没有一个人丝毫表现疲乏。最后大家得出了四条办法：
    （一）为了做到“细收细打颗粒还家”，除动员每个社员认真仔细收割外，要在社里增设四个检查员和四个保管员。检查员一面负责检查收割过的庄稼田，一面经常注意调查每块谷子、高粱的成熟程度，以便及时收割免受风灾。保管员负责入仓的粮食不受一粒损失。
      （二）收割时要注意技术，割起的谷子、高粱要放得轻和薄，穗子要放得整齐，一面便利妇女们切穗切得快，同时还可避免丢穗。
      （三）拉到场上的谷子、高粱要看护好，不让鸡、雀吃掉一粒粮。辗场时要仔细，要多辗几次，做到打净晒干颗粒不剩。
      （四）迅速修理好放粮的家俱和仓房，做好防潮湿防特务防老鼠的工作。
    四项办法都做到后，全社主要作物做到地净场光时，共可增产两千二百六十七斤粮。
    现在“细收细打争取多收两千斤粮”的计划已经变成全体社员的实际行动了。在谷田里，社员张厚基推着一小车谷穗往场走时，当他走在路上看到脚下有一个小谷穗时，他就连忙停住车，把它拾起来，跟在他后边一个老汉笑着说他“小谷穗你也看得见”，他却说：“嗨！可不敢小看这小谷穗，两千斤粮就是这小谷穗积起来的。”在打谷场上，几个社员正鞭打着骡子辗豆秸。一个社员说：“这已经是辗第三次了，要是在过去辗一次就算了。”前几天老社员们还在重复着一句老古话：“穷豆秸，富谷穗，麦秸里才有干粮。”现在他们也不嫌豆秸穷了，因为刚辗了一遍，豆秸下面就有了许多豆颗颗。
    现在也没有人再到合作社的谷田去拾谷穗了。因为每个社员都从思想上认识了和相信了细收细打能多收粮食的事实，所以他们在收割时特别认真仔细。四小队的检查员在谷草里检查了一天也没找出一个谷穗来。
