Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th. Since the start of the explanation work, the U.S. side and the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee secret agents under its command have exhausted all means to obstruct the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war from listening to explanations, disrupting the progress of the explanation work, and using force to threaten the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war not to apply for repatriation, thoroughly violating the letter and spirit of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work." In response, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, the chief member of the Korean and Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, lodged the strongest protest to the U.S. side at the commission meeting on October 19 and resolutely demanded that the U.S. side immediately cease all such blatant, illegal, and criminal acts that violate international law and agreements.

The full text of General Li Xiangchao's protest at the October 19 meeting is as follows:

    Due to your side's deliberate delay, the explanation work was not started until October 15. Since the explanation work began, the conspiracy long planned by your side to disrupt the explanation work has been exposed to the world. Your side not only dispatched a large number of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee secret agents to impersonate our prisoners of war and infiltrate the prisoner-of-war camps, but also issued instructions to them through various channels to disrupt the explanation work, using these agents to implement a reign of terror in the prisoner-of-war camps, threatening our prisoners of war not to apply for repatriation. This situation has been fully confirmed by our returning personnel who broke through the terrorist rule of your agents. Fearing that the threats and terror carried out by the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee agents under your command were not sufficient, your side sent military aircraft to circle over the detention areas on the first day of the explanation work, attempting to use this to cheer on your agents dispatched to the detention areas and increase the threat to our prisoners of war.

    Your side has also dispatched secret agents from the Kuomintang reactionary remnants who have long persecuted our prisoners of war in your prisoner-of-war camps to act as your representatives and interpreters, appearing inside the explanation tents, openly disrupting many provisions of the "Terms of Reference" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work," and openly and directly interfering with the explanation work, threatening our prisoners of war so that they dare not apply for repatriation. It must be emphasized that the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group does not belong to either of the warring parties in Korea. In the past, your side has used the secret agent saboteurs of this bandit remnant group to carry out various brutal persecutions against our prisoners of war in your prisoner-of-war camps in order to achieve the goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Now, your side openly dispatches these secret agent saboteurs to serve as your official representatives and enter the explanation venues to obstruct and disrupt the implementation of the explanation rules, threaten our prisoners of war, and use this as a means to forcibly detain them. This thoroughly proves that after your side's criminal conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war has been exposed to the world, you have not hesitated to completely destroy all principles of international law and openly use bandit secret agent saboteurs to carry out disruptive activities as the main means for your side to handle international affairs. This is intolerable to all just humanity.

    According to the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work," your representatives only have the right to observe and, at most, can only submit opinions to the chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission or its subsidiary bodies after each explanation. However, your so-called representatives constantly disrupt the progress of the explanation work, insult the members of the subsidiary bodies of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, resist the orders of the chairman of the subsidiary bodies of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and openly threaten our prisoners of war, making them afraid to apply for repatriation. Your side's disregard for the "Terms of Reference" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work" is further proven by another fact. The "Terms of Reference" clearly stipulates that only the explaining party has the right to carry communication equipment into the detention area, but your side openly carries radio stations into the explanation camp.

    The current situation is that your side, on the one hand, dispatches secret agents to infiltrate the detention area and directs them to disrupt the explanation work, and on the other hand, uses secret agents in the explanation tents to interfere with the explanation and threaten our prisoners of war. On October 17, when a secret agent mixed in with the prisoners of war beat our explanation representative in explanation tent No. 18 according to your side's prior instructions and was arrested by the Indian guard troops, he openly said to your representative: "You told me to do this, what am I going to do now?" This fact vividly proves that the current explanation work is being carried out under your side's indirect and direct control and manipulation. This situation thoroughly violates the letter and spirit of the "Terms of Reference" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work." In response, I lodge the strongest protest to your side and resolutely demand that your side immediately cease all the above-mentioned blatant, illegal, and criminal acts that violate international law and agreements!

    在军事停战委员会十九日会议上
    李相朝将军向美方提出的抗议全文
    【新华社开城二十日电】解释工作开始以来，美方及其指挥下的蒋李特务，正用尽各种方法，阻挠朝中被俘人员听取解释，破坏解释工作的进行，以武力威胁朝中被俘人员不得申请遣返，彻底违反了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”及“解释和访问工作细则”的文字与精神。对此，军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将，已于十月十九日在该委员会会议上向美方提出最强硬的抗议，并坚决要求美方立即停止这种明目张胆、破坏国际公法、违反协议的一切非法罪恶行为。
    李相朝中将在十月十九日会议上的抗议全文如下：
    由于你方蓄意拖延，解释工作迟至十月十五日才开始。自从解释工作开始以来，你方长期布置的破坏解释工作的阴谋已暴露于世。你方不但派遣了大批蒋李特务冒充我方被俘人员混入战俘看管地区，并且通过种种途径向他们发布破坏解释工作的指示，利用这些特务在战俘营中实行恐怖统治，威胁我方被俘人员不得申请遣返。此种情况已由突破你方特务恐怖统治的我方归来人员加以充分证实。你方唯恐蒋李特务在你方指挥下所进行的威胁与恐怖还不够充分，更在解释工作开始的第一天派军用飞机在看管地区的上空盘旋，企图借此为派入看管地区的你方特务助威，增加对我方被俘人员的威胁。
    你方更派遣了长期在你方战俘营中迫害我方被俘人员的国民党反动残余的特务充当你方的代表和译员，出现于解释帐篷之内，公然破坏“职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”的许多规定，对解释工作进行公开的和直接的干扰，以威胁我方被俘人员，使其不敢申请遣返。必须强调指出，国民党反动残余集团根本不属于朝鲜交战的一方。过去你方即已利用这个匪帮残余集团的特务破坏分子在你方战俘营中对我方被俘人员进行各种残暴的迫害，以便达到强迫扣留战俘的目的。现在你方更公然派遣这些特务破坏分子充当你方的正式代表进入解释场所，来阻挠破坏解释规则的实施，威胁我方被俘人员，并借此将他们强迫扣留。这彻底证明你方在你方强迫扣留战俘的罪恶阴谋已经大白于世之后，已不惜完全破坏一切国际公法的原则，公开以使用匪类特务破坏分子进行破坏活动作为你方处理国际事务的主要手段。这是全体正义人类所不能够容忍的。
    根据“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”，你方代表只有观察之权，最多也只能在每次解释结束后向中立国遣返委员会或其附属机构的主席提出意见。但你方的所谓代表却不断扰乱解释工作的进行，侮辱中立国遣返委员会附属机构的组员，抗拒中立国遣返委员会附属机构主席的命令，并公开威胁我方被俘人员，使其不敢申请遣返。你方无视“职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”的行为更从另一事实中得到证明。“职权范围”明白规定只有解释一方有权携带通讯设备进入看管地区，但你方却公然携带电台进入解释营场。
    目前的情况是：你方一方面派遣特务混入看管地区，并指挥他们破坏解释工作，另一方面利用特务在解释帐篷内干扰解释，威胁我方被俘人员。十月十七日，混入战俘中的一名特务按照你方事先的指示在十八号解释帐篷殴打我方解释代表而遭印度看管部队逮捕时，就公开向你方代表说：“就是你叫我这样做的，现在我怎么办呢？”这一事实生动地证明目前解释工作是在你方间接与直接的控制和操纵之下进行的。这种情况彻底违反了“职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”的文字与精神。对此，我向你方提出最强硬的抗议，并坚决要求你方立即停止上述明目张胆、破坏国际公法、违反协议的一切非法罪恶行为！
