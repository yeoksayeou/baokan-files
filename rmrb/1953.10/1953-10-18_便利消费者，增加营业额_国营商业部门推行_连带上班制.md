    To better serve production and consumers, expand commodity circulation, and ensure the fulfillment and over-fulfillment of the requirements for increasing the sales revenue of state-owned commercial enterprises, the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government has made a decision to implement the "Continuous Operation System" in state-owned commercial enterprises. The main points of the decision are as follows:
    1. Cancel the regulation of closing for one day each week and adopt the method of maintaining normal business hours every day while employees take turns resting, to further leverage the effectiveness of state-owned commercial enterprise facilities. Implementing this method can increase the number of business days by more than 16%, which not only meets the needs of the majority of consumers but also increases the turnover of commercial enterprises.
    2. According to feedback from various regions, many advanced units have already made some innovations in this regard. This proves that as long as the leadership pays attention and relies on all employees, this measure can be implemented and be effective. The advanced experience of the No. 2 Store of the Shenyang Department Store Company in implementing the "Continuous Operation System" is a good example.
    3. State-owned commercial enterprises across the country must earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the No. 2 Store of the Shenyang Department Store Company, and through specific examples and calculations, explain to all employees the important significance of this measure for facilitating production and consumers, and expanding the turnover of state-owned commerce. It should also be pointed out that this is also the glorious task of all state-owned commercial employees to better serve production and consumers, mobilizing everyone to improve labor organization and working methods.
    This measure basically requires organization and implementation without increasing personnel. To this end, the commercial departments/bureaus of each province and city must effectively review the labor utilization of each enterprise, and try to reduce the proportion of indirect business personnel (which is generally too large now and unreasonable) to increase direct business personnel. Within their respective jurisdictions, necessary and reasonable personnel adjustments can be made among different companies and enterprises.
    4. The commercial administrations of major administrative areas, and the commercial departments/bureaus of each province and city must earnestly implement this decision, requiring implementation in most, or even all, enterprises by the end of November.

    便利消费者，增加营业额
    国营商业部门推行“连带上班制”
    为了更好地为生产与消费者服务，扩大商品流转，保证完成与超额完成增加国营商业卖钱额的要求，中央人民政府商业部已作出在国营商业企业部门实行“连带上班制”的决定。决定要点如下：
    一、取消每周停止营业一天的规定，采取每天营业时间照常，而营业员轮流休息的办法，以进一步发挥国营商业企业设备的效能。实行这个办法，营业日数可增加百分之十六以上，既符合广大消费者的要求，也可增加商业企业部门的营业额。
    二、根据各地反映，不少先进单位在这方面已有若干创造。这证明了只要领导上重视，依靠全体职工，这一措施是可以实行并行之有效的。沈阳市百货公司第二商店，实行的“连带上班制”的先进经验就是一个很好的例子。
    三、全国国营商业企业，必须认真学习沈阳市百货公司第二商店的先进经验，通过具体事例与计算向全体职工讲清这一措施对于便利生产与消费者，以及扩大国营商业营业额的重要意义，并指出：这也是国营商业全体职工同志更好地为生产与消费者服务的光荣任务，动员大家改进劳动组织与工作方法。
    这一措施，基本上要求在不增加人员的条件下予以组织实现，为此，各省市商业厅、局必须切实审查各企业的劳动力使用情况，设法减少间接营业人员的比例（现在一般过大，是不合理的），以增加直接营业人员。在所辖区内，不同的公司企业中，可以进行必要的、合理的人员调剂。
    四、各大区商业管理局、各省市商业厅、局必须认真贯彻这一决定，要求十一月底在大部、以至全部企业中实行。
