After the private Minsheng Shipping Company was reorganized into a public-private partnership last September 1, and after enterprise reform and organizational adjustments, its business has seen significant development.

Minsheng Shipping Company was originally the largest private shipping company in China. In the past, it had a bloated and unwieldy organization, poor management, low production efficiency, and frequent accidents, with an average daily loss of 140 million yuan. In 1952, the board of directors of Minsheng Shipping Company submitted a request to the People's Government for a public-private partnership. After approval by the Central Ministry of Transportation, it was officially reorganized into a public-private partnership on September 1, 1952. After the reorganization, under the leadership of the public shares and with the strong support and assistance of the relevant departments of the People's Government, the company thoroughly carried out democratic reforms, cleared out special agents and feudal foremen who were entrenched in various departments of the company and continued to carry out sabotage activities and oppress employees. The company's leadership also clearly established the concept of relying on the masses of employees, implementing democratic management, and improving operation and management. Secondly, the organizational structure was reformed, reducing 35 percent of redundant personnel (by holding temporary training classes and training them), and various systems were established, such as a unified personnel management system, ship scheduling system, mechanical management system, treasury management and budget system, and supply system. Preliminary planned management was also implemented. At the same time, an employee representative meeting was convened to launch a full-load shipping and increased production and conservation movement. After the public-private partnership, the relations of production in the enterprise changed, the consciousness of employees increased, and they eagerly sought out skills, improved operating methods, promoted advanced experience, and cleared waste materials on ships to increase deadweight, thereby greatly exploiting the potential for production. The average deadweight of ships increased by 27 percent, with a maximum of 48 percent. In addition, many new records were created, such as in the past, it took eight days to travel from Hankou to Chongqing, but now, by utilizing moonlight for night navigation, it only takes four days. Port workers on shore also launched a competition for fast loading and unloading, increasing loading and unloading efficiency by 62 percent. In addition, a major safety and hygiene inspection campaign was launched, reducing navigation accidents and ensuring the safety of passengers.

After the public-private partnership, Minsheng Shipping Company criticized capitalist business ideology and established the business policy of serving national construction and the needs of the people in the shipping industry. In the past, Minsheng Shipping Company's business policy was highly speculative. For example, in the dry season, it scrambled for cargo everywhere, but when there was a lot of cargo or the state had urgent transportation tasks, it could not arrange and dispatch well. For example, during the eastward transportation of Sichuan grain in 1950, the export of Sichuan grain was affected due to poor arrangement and dispatch work, causing losses to the government and farmers. After the public-private partnership, the policy of low profits and high volume transportation was implemented to strive for the export of Sichuan grain, overcoming the waste phenomenon of only carrying 40 percent of capacity downstream for the past two years, and increasing the company's income; and also increasing the price of grain in Sichuan, thereby increasing the purchasing power of farmers and stimulating the massive import of industrial products, further enlivening the southwest market.

With the efforts of the employees, the deadweight of Minsheng Shipping Company's ships has increased from 22,000 tons before the public-private partnership to the current 34,000 tons, and it is striving to increase it to 44,000 tons by the end of this year. This year, it plans to transport 860,000 tons of cargo, more than double the highest annual record of 380,000 tons in the past. Costs have also been reduced by 30 percent. In the past, the cost per ton-kilometer was 410 yuan, but now it has been reduced to 289 yuan.

Because Minsheng Shipping Company's business has improved after the public-private partnership, it earned a surplus of more than 12 billion yuan from September to December last year alone. Shareholders all received a dividend of four percent on their shares. Private shareholders were very happy and regained confidence in their business. In the past, the board of directors did not play a significant role and was merely a formality. Many directors did not attend meetings. After the public-private partnership, because the company's major issues (such as the company's reform plan, the determination of the share value and the draft articles of association for the public-private partnership, etc.) were resolved through prior consultation and meeting resolutions each time a joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors was held, many directors who had not attended for a long time rushed to participate in the second joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors held in Hankou in March this year. The directors unanimously praised the superiority of the public-private partnership at the meeting. Director Kang Xinru said at the meeting: "The company has rarely distributed dividends since its establishment in 1925. Everyone has lost confidence in the stock. We were very happy to determine the share value after the public-private partnership, and we were overjoyed to receive dividends in a short period of time." Chairman Zhou Xiaohuai said that he has been a director of Minsheng Shipping Company for more than 20 years and has never attended a meeting. Now, although he is old, he must come to participate because the company has been reborn. After returning to Beijing from the meeting, Director He Beiheng wrote a letter to the Hankou headquarters saying that after returning to Beijing, he had reported to several shareholders in Beijing about the company's amazing achievements in recent months and the tasks that the company will undertake in the country's construction plan in the future. His letter said, "Those who heard it were happy and excited, with smiles on their faces, and all thought it was a very happy event worth celebrating."

At the end of May this year, Minsheng Shipping Company held its 1953 annual shareholders meeting in Chongqing. The board of directors and the deputy general manager reported on the achievements after the public-private partnership, and all shareholders were very excited. The meeting announced that the Central Ministry of Transportation had appointed Li Yiqing, Liu Huinong and 13 others as public shareholders' directors, and Tao Qi, Jiang Dong and 6 others as public shareholders' supervisors. Private shareholders also elected Zhou Xiaohuai, Wu Jinhang, Huang Renzhi, Kang Xinru, Qian Xinzhi and 5 others as private shareholders' directors, and Zhou Zuomin and 3 others as private shareholders' supervisors, forming a board of directors including representatives of public and private shares. The board of directors also elected Zhang Pingzhi, Ouyang Ping, Zhang Wenang, Kang Xinru and 5 others as standing directors, Zhou Xiaohuai as chairman, Li Yiqing, Liu Huinong, Zheng Dongqin, and Wu Jinhang as vice chairmen, and also decided that Tao Qi would be the standing supervisor and Zhou Zuomin would be the deputy standing supervisor.

In order to better cooperate with the state-owned transportation forces to serve production and construction, Minsheng Shipping Company has determined that the funds for capital construction for the whole year are 11.14 billion yuan, building ten new barges, one fast passenger ship, and three derrick ships, renovating fifteen old barges, and also plans to build cable cars and warehouses, and at the same time allocate 15 billion to build dormitories and hospitals. These facts all powerfully demonstrate that after the company's public-private partnership, due to the correct implementation of the policy of taking into account both public and private interests, it is extremely beneficial to the country, to employees, and to private shareholders.

    公私合营后彻底进行了企业改革
    民生轮船公司业务有显著发展
    【本报讯】    私营民生轮船公司从去年九月一日改组为公私合营后，经过企业改革和调整机构，业务有了较显著的发展。
    民生轮船公司原是我国私营轮船业中最大的一家，过去机构臃肿庞大，经营不善，生产效率低，经常发生事故，平均每天要亏损一亿四千万元。一九五二年民生轮船公司董事会向人民政府提出公私合营的请求，经过中央交通部批准，从一九五二年九月一日起正式改组为公私合营。改组后，公司在公股的领导下和在人民政府有关部门的大力支持与扶助下，彻底进行了民主改革，清除了盘据在公司各部门继续进行破坏活动和压迫职工的特务与封建把头，该公司领导方面也明确树立了依靠职工群众，实行民主管理，改善经营管理的观念。其次改革了组织机构，减少百分之三十五的冗员（举办临时训练班，加以训练），并建立了各种制度，如统一的人事管理制度、船舶调度制度、机务管理制度、金库管理和预决算制度、供应制度，还初步推行了计划管理。同时又召开了职工代表会，发动了满载赶航增产节约运动。公私合营后，企业中的生产关系有了改变，职工觉悟提高，争先恐后地寻找窍门，改善操作方法，推广先进经验，清理船上废料增加载重，因此大大地发挥了生产潜在力，船舶载重量平均提高了百分之二十七，最高达百分之四十八。此外，还创造了许多新纪录，如过去从汉口到重庆需八天时间，现在利用月色夜航，只要四天就成了。岸上港务职工也开展了快装快卸竞赛，提高装卸效率百分之六十二。此外，还开展了安全卫生大检查运动，减少了航行事故，保证了旅客的安全。
    民生轮船公司公私合营后，批判了资本主义经营思想，树立了航运事业为国家建设和人民需要服务的经营方针。过去，民生轮船公司的经营方针带有很大的投机性，如枯水季节四处抢夺货源，货多或国家有紧急运输任务时，却不能很好安排调度。如一九五○年川粮东运时，就因为安排调度工作作得不好，影响了川粮的出口，使政府和农民都受到损失。公私合营后，贯彻了低利多运政策，争取川粮出口，克服了两年来下水只载四成的浪费现象，增加了公司的收入；并使四川粮价提高，从而提高了农民购买力，刺激了工业品的大量进口，进一步活跃了西南市场。
    在职工的努力下，民生轮船公司的船舶载重量由公私合营前的二万二千吨，提高到现在的三万四千吨，并争取在今年年底提高到四万四千吨。今年计划可运八十六万吨货，比过去最高年纪录三十八万吨，提高了一倍多。成本也降低了百分之三十，过去每吨公里的成本是四一○元，现在已减为二八九元。
    民生轮船公司因为公私合营业务有了改善后，仅去年九月到十二月就获得盈余一百二十余亿元。股东都按股本额分到四厘股息。私股股东十分高兴，恢复了经营信心。过去董事会作用不大，流于形式，开起会来很多董事不参加；公私合营后，因为在每次召开董监联席会议时，都采取事先协商、会议决议的方式解决公司重大问题（如公司改革方案，确定股值和公私合营章程草案等），所以今年三月在汉口召开第二次董监联席会议时，许多久不出席的董事，都赶来参加。董事们在会上一致赞扬公私合营的优越性。康心如董事在会议上说：“公司从一九二五年成立到现在很少分股息红利，大家对股票已失去信心，公私合营后确定了股值就非常高兴，而短期内又分到股息真是喜出望外。”周孝怀董事长说，他当了民生轮船公司二十多年董事，从来没有参加过会议，现在虽然年老，也要来参加，因为公司新生了。何北衡董事开完会回北京后写信给汉口总公司说，他回京后已向在北京的数位股东报告了公司几月来的惊人成绩和公司今后在国家建设计划中所负担的任务，他的信中说，“闻者皆愉快兴奋，笑容满面，都认为是一件值得庆贺的大喜事”。
    今年五月底，民生轮船公司在重庆召开了一九五三年股东常会，由董事会及副总经理报告公私合营后的成绩，全体股东都很振奋。会上宣布了中央交通部委派李一清、刘惠农等十五人为公股董事，陶琦、江冬等八人为公股监察人，私股股东也在会上选举了周孝怀、吴晋航、黄任之、康心如、钱新之等十人为私股董事，周作民等四人为私股监察人，组成了包括公私股代表的董事会。董事会并选出张平之、欧阳平、张文昂、康心如等九人为常务董事，周孝怀为董事长，李一清、刘惠农、郑东琴、吴晋航为副董事长，又决定陶琦为常务监察人，周作民为副常务监察人。
    民生轮船公司为了更好地配合国营运输力量为生产和建设服务，确定了全年基本建设的资金为一一一四亿元，新造驳船十艘、快速客轮一艘、吊杆船三艘，改造旧驳十五艘，还打算修建缆车和仓库，同时拨一百五十亿修建宿舍和医院。这些事实都有力地说明了该公司公私合营后，由于正确地贯彻了公私兼顾的政策，对国家、对职工、对私股股东都是极其有利的。
