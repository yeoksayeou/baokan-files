Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Factories and mines under the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Heavy Industry Ministry completed their September production plans for five major products. Among these, iron ore exceeded the plan by 21.1 percent, coke by 2.1 percent, pig iron by 3.8 percent, steel by 7.2 percent, and steel products by 1.9 percent. Fifteen units, including Benxi Iron and Steel Company, Fushun Steel Plant, Tianjin Steel Plant, Tangshan Steel Plant, and Yangquan Iron Plant, completed all production plans for major products. This is the best month for the iron and steel industry to complete its production plans this year.

In September, state-owned iron and steel industry plants and mines focused on implementing work plans, strengthening production scheduling, and establishing and improving the responsibility system in the increase production and practice economy campaign. Through the work plans, the tasks of increasing production and practicing economy were specifically implemented into the daily work of each production unit and even each worker, so that the workers' enthusiasm for labor and scientific management were closely combined, the production balance rate was greatly improved, and unplanned downtime was greatly reduced, thereby increasing output. For example, at Tangshan Steel Plant, steelmaking in converters was carried out according to the indicated charts, the slagging and charging time was shortened, and the actual steel output per furnace increased by 0.34 tons compared with the plan. The actual increase in steel output per furnace in electric furnace steelmaking was also 0.448 tons. After the rolling steel Class C of Shanghai Xinhu Steel Plant produced according to the indicated chart, the daily production balance rate also reached 100%.

In September, various plants and mines also strengthened equipment maintenance, which generally reduced the number of equipment repairs and shortened the repair time. For example, Benxi Iron and Steel Company originally planned to repair electric furnaces three times in September, but only repaired them once. The repair time for the open hearth furnace at Tianjin Steel Plant was originally set at 144 hours, but it actually took only 123 hours.

In terms of technical operations, various plants and mines also implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts and promoted advanced experience. For example, after Fushun Steel Plant's electric furnace steelmaking switched to the "non-oxidation method," the boiling time of molten steel was shortened; Tianjin Steel Plant consolidated the results of rapid open hearth steelmaking, creating a new production record of refining one furnace of steel in five hours and forty-seven minutes in September.

    钢铁工业五种主要产品超额完成九月份计划
    【新华社十七日讯】中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属厂矿，九月份完成了五种主要产品的生产计划。其中铁矿超额百分之二十一点一，焦炭超额百分之二点一，生铁超额百分之三点八，钢超额百分之七点二，钢材超额百分之一点九。完成主要产品全部生产计划的有本溪钢铁公司、抚顺钢厂、天津钢厂、唐山钢厂、阳泉铁厂等十五个单位。这是今年以来钢铁工业完成生产计划最好的一个月。
    九月份，国营钢铁工业各厂矿在增产节约竞赛中，着重贯彻了作业计划、加强了生产调度工作，并建立和健全了责任制。通过作业计划，增产节约的任务就被具体地贯彻到每个生产单位以至每个职工的日常工作中去，使得职工的劳动热情和科学管理紧密地结合起来，生产的均衡率大大提高，非计划的停工时间大大减少，从而增加了产量。如唐山钢厂转炉炼钢由于按指示图表进行生产，扒渣、装料时间缩短了，每炉实际出钢吨数就比计划增加了零点三四吨。电炉炼钢每炉也实际增加了零点四四八吨。上海新沪钢厂轧钢丙班按指示图表生产后，每日生产均衡率也达到了百分之百。
    各厂矿在九月份又加强了设备维护工作，使得设备的修理次数普遍减少，修理时间也普遍缩短。如本溪钢铁公司九月份原计划修电炉三次，结果只修了一次。天津钢厂平炉的修理时间原订为一百四十四小时，而实际上只化了一百二十三小时。
    在技术操作方面，各厂矿也贯彻执行了苏联专家建议，推广了先进经验。如抚顺钢厂电炉炼钢改用“不氧化法”后，缩短了钢水沸腾时间；天津钢厂巩固平炉快速炼钢的成绩，九月份创造了五小时四十七分炼一炉钢的生产新纪录。
