    Congratulating Chinese Peasants on Chinese National Day
    Dimitar Kenev
    Vice Chairman of the Dimitrov Agricultural Production Cooperative, Bulgaria
    Dimitar Kenev
    Dear Chinese peasant brothers:
    On the occasion of the victory of the Chinese people and the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I extend warm greetings to you on behalf of the farmers of the Rezhovo Konare village cooperative in Bulgaria.
    Our two countries are thousands of kilometers apart. When the sun is about to set in your country, we are just about to greet the dawn. But this has no effect on our friendship; our friendship grows and is consolidated under the radiant sun of our common friendship with the great Soviet Union, because this friendship is equal, a friendship of builders of a new human life.
    I follow with great interest the great achievements you have made in agricultural production in China from newspapers and radio broadcasts, and rejoice in every victory of yours.
    The People's Republic of China has been a strong fortress of peace and democracy since the day it was founded. The Chinese People's Volunteers' cause of defeating the aggressors together with the Korean people is great. Therefore, when the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, the whole world warmly congratulated the great Chinese people.
    The Bulgarian people celebrated the ninth anniversary of our country's liberation from fascist and imperialist enslavement three weeks ago. The workers pointed out their production achievements last year with justifiable pride. The farmers of agricultural production cooperatives reported to the Communist Party and the government high agricultural harvests and the high degree of development of agricultural production cooperatives. Fundamental changes have taken place in the Bulgarian countryside. Six hundred thousand individual farmers have abandoned small-scale commodity production and embarked on the glorious road of socialist development. The most modern machines—tractors and combine harvesters—have replaced wooden plows. The average grain harvest has increased by more than one-third compared to the harvest of individual farmers.
    I would like to briefly tell you about the changes that have taken place in our village in the era of the people's regime, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party.
    In the past, a small number of landlords and usurers occupied more than one-third of the land in the village. More than 80 percent of the residents had only small plots of land of ten to fifty decares (each decare equals 0.2471 acres), while hired farmhands did not even have one decare of land. The whole village worked for the landlords. The labor was heavy, simply an unbearable burden. Women aged early and did not know what youth was. Children had to find their own bread. There was not even a hospital or a doctor in the village. But the Communist Party pointed out to us the social inequality and the road to fight against it. The peasants actively participated in the anti-fascist September Uprising in 1923. During the years of resistance against the enemy from 1941 to 1944, many people in the village joined the guerrillas, while others supported the guerrillas and supplied them with food, and many were imprisoned in concentration camps. After the Soviet army liberated our country, the Party instructed us on how to eliminate poverty and ignorance.
    In the spring of 1945, we organized an agricultural production cooperative. Now, except for the rich peasants, 90 percent of the farmers in the village are members of the cooperative. This cooperative owns more than 30,000 decares of land. The state-owned machine tractor station is our solid pillar for striving for a bumper harvest. With its help, the main work in our agriculture is mechanized: the degree of mechanization of tillage work reaches 100 percent, the degree of mechanization of sowing work also reaches 100 percent, and the degree of mechanization of harvesting grain with combine harvesters reaches 60 percent.... In terms of adopting agricultural technology and Soviet experience, the mechanics are our most important assistants. Although in the first year of the establishment of the cooperative farm, 1945, we only harvested 120 kilograms of wheat from each decare of land, this year the average harvest of wheat has reached an average of 250 kilograms. The productivity of livestock farms has also increased. This quickly promoted the increase of income of the members. This year, their income has never been reached by individual households. Each cooperative member has five decares of land for their own use, a cow, and several sheep, pigs, and poultry.
    Our members live in spacious and bright houses. In the past four or five years, more than 400 new houses have been built in the village. The village has been electrified and equipped with radios. We have established a new hospital with obstetrics and dental departments. Not long ago, we built a cultural palace, which has a movie theater that can accommodate 500 people, a library with a large collection of books, and a well-equipped reading room. Culture has become everyone's common property. Now there are no illiterate farmers. Former poor peasants are effectively studying Michurin's theory in agronomy groups under the leadership of agronomists. Women, along with men, participate in the study of political schools. All children are enrolled in local schools. In the village, it is rare to encounter young men and women who have not received secondary or specialized education. In the era of the people's regime, more than 100 people have completed higher and specialized colleges. The children of cooperative members, Tsinka Trifonova and Peter Kolev, are already doctors. The two sons of cooperative member Duncho Chakenov are studying mechanical engineering.
    New people are growing up in mutual friendly labor. Not long ago, the previously unknown peasant woman Gishka Intiva has become one of the best figures in the cooperative. The horticultural group she leads ranks first in the cooperative. Group leaders Kirili Trifanov, Vasily Kenov, and Nivena Ginkova graduated with excellent grades from vocational training classes. They are all children of hired farmhands. Many members have been rewarded by the government for their production achievements.
    The great ideas of Stalin's plan for transforming nature have also come to us. Young protective forest belts over 200 kilometers long surround the cooperative's fields. The water of the Struma River flows along the canals to our fields according to our wishes. We use electric pumps to draw water from underground. For many centuries, water has been two to three meters deep underground, but the crops have withered due to drought. The friendly labor of the People's Government and the cooperative members gives us the strength to use this water.
    But we are not satisfied with this. We have a beautiful prospect before us. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and our beloved Comrade Chervenkov, we will spare no effort to create a happy, prosperous, and happy future for our people.
    We will move forward hand in hand with you, in friendship with the Soviet people, and in the struggle against the enemies of peace and democracy, along the road of socialism.
    Long live the great Chinese people—the fearless warriors for peace and socialism!

    向中国农民祝贺中国国庆
    保加利亚季米特洛夫
    农业生产合作社副主席
    季米特·凯湼夫
    亲爱的中国农民兄弟们：
    当此中国人民获得胜利和中华人民共和国成立四周年之际，我代表保加利亚雷热沃·科纳列村合作社的农民们向你们热烈地敬礼。
    我们两国相隔有数千公里之遥，当你们那里太阳快落时，我们却正要迎接黎明。但是这对我们的友谊是没有影响的；我们的友谊在我们和伟大苏联的共同友谊的光辉太阳下增长着和巩固着，因为这种友谊是平等的，是人类新生活建设者的友谊。
    我以极大的兴趣从报纸上和无线电广播中注意你们在中国农业生产上所获得的伟大成就，并为你们的每一胜利而欢欣。
    中华人民共和国从成立的那一天起，就已成为和平和民主的坚强堡垒。中国人民志愿军在和朝鲜人民一道战胜侵略者的事业是伟大的。因此当朝鲜停战谈判签字时，全世界都热烈地祝贺伟大的中国人民。
    保加利亚人民在三个星期之前，曾庆祝了我国自法西斯主义和帝国主义奴役下解放的九周年。劳动者们怀着正当的自豪心情指出了去年自己的生产成就。农业生产合作社的农民们向共产党和政府报告了农业上的高额收获和农业生产合作社的高度发展情况。保加利亚的农村中已起了根本的变化。六十万个体农户抛弃了小商品生产而走上了向社会主义发展的光辉道路。最新式的机器——拖拉机和联合收割机——代替了木犁。谷物的平均收获量较个体农户的收获量增加了三分之一以上。
    我想简短地向你们谈一谈在人民政权年代、在保加利亚共产党领导之下我们村里所发生的变化。
    过去，为数不多的地主和高利贷者占有村里三分之一以上的土地。百分之八十以上的居民只有十到五十个达克（每一达克等于○·二四七一英亩）的小块土地，雇农则连一达克的土地都没有。全村都为地主工作。劳动很重，简直是一种不能胜任的负担。妇女很早就衰老，不知道所谓青春。小孩子们要自己想法找面包。村里连一所医院和一个医生都没有。但是共产党向我们指出社会不平等现象及和它进行斗争的道路。农民们积极地参加了一九二三年反法西斯的九月起义。在一九四一—一九四四年反抗敌人的年代中，村里有很多人参加了游击队，另一些人则支援游击队并供应他们粮食，很多人被关进了集中营。在苏军解放我国以后，党又指示我们怎样消灭贫困和愚昧。
    一九四五年春天，我们组织了农业生产合作社。现在除富农外，全村百分之九十的农民都是合作社的社员。这个合作社拥有三万多达克的土地。国营机器拖拉机站是我们争取丰收的稳固支柱。在它的帮助下，我们农业中的主要工作都用机器进行：耕地工作的机械化程度达百分之百，播种工作机械化的程度也达到百分之百，用联合收割机收割谷物的工作机械化程度达百分之六十……。在采用农业技术和苏联的经验方面，机械师们是我们的最主要的助手。虽然在成立合作社农场的第一年，一九四五年，我们从每一达克土地上只收了一百二十公斤小麦，但今年小麦的平均收获量已平均达到二百五十公斤。牲畜饲养场的产品生产率也提高了。这就很快地促进了社员们收入的增加。今年他们的收入已是个体户所从未达到过的。每户社员都有五达克供自己使用的土地，一头牛，若干只羊、猪和家禽。
    我们的社员都住着宽敞而明亮的房子。在最近四、五年中，村里建起了四百多所新房子。村子已电气化并装设了无线电。我们已建立了附有产科和牙科的新医院。不久前我们又修建了一所文化宫，其中有可容五百人的电影放映厅，一所藏书很多的图书馆和一个设备得很好的阅览室。文化已成为大家的公共所有物。现在已经没有不识字的农民了。以前的贫雇农在农学家的领导下正在农艺小组中有成效地研究米丘林的学说。妇女们和男子一道参加了政治学校的学习。所有儿童都入了当地的学校。在村里很少遇到没有受中等或专科教育的青年男女。在人民政权年代，已有一百多人读完了高等和专科学院。合作社社员的孩子，琴卡·特里法诺娃和彼德·科列夫，已是医生了。社员邓乔·查肯罗夫的两个儿子正在学习机械工程学。
    新的人在互相的友爱的劳动中成长起来。不久以前尚未为人所知的农妇吉什卡·英季娃已成为合作社中最优秀的人物之一。她所领导的园艺小组在合作社中占第一位。小组长基里利·特利法诺夫，瓦西里·肯诺夫和尼文娜·金科娃从专业训练班毕业时成绩优良，他们都是雇农的孩子。许多社员由于生产成绩而得到政府的奖励。
    斯大林改造自然计划的伟大思想也来到我们这里。长达二百多公里的幼年防护林带围绕着合作社的田地。斯特伦玛河的水，依照我们的意愿沿着水渠流向我们的田地。我们用电动唧筒汲取地面下的水。好多世纪以来水在地面下深达二——三公尺，但田禾却因受旱而枯萎。人民政府和合作社成员的友爱劳动，使我们有力量利用这些水。
    但我们并不以此为满足。在我们面前有着美丽的远景。在共产党和敬爱的契尔文科夫同志的英明领导下，我们将不遗余力地来创造我国人民的快乐、丰裕和幸福的未来。
    我们将同你们手携手地、在和苏联人民的友谊中，在同和平与民主的敌人进行斗争中，沿着社会主义的道路前进。
    伟大的中国人民——争取和平与社会主义的无畏战士万岁！
