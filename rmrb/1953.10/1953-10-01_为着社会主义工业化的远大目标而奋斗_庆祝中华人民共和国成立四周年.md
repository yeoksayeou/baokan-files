    The People's Republic of China has been founded for four years. In these four years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, our people have completely overthrown the bloody rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, transforming the dark old China into a bright new China with people's democracy. The workers have become the leading class of the country, the peasants have gained land and other significant economic and political benefits, intellectuals can now contribute their knowledge to the construction of the country, and the people's lives have been generally and gradually improved. Our country is now completely independent and unified, and all ethnic groups are united in a free and equal family. Our people's democratic system is becoming more and more complete day by day, and grassroots elections have already begun this year. We have formed a solid alliance with the great Soviet people, fought off the American imperialist aggression against Korea together with the heroic Korean people, and victoriously achieved an armistice. We completed the economic recovery work in 1952 and entered the first year of planned economic construction in 1953. Because of all this, how filled are our hearts with hatred for the old era and gratitude and love for the new era as we celebrate the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China! How are the hopes for a happy future life unfolding before our eyes, and how much hard work are we willing to put in to realize these hopes!
    On the eve of this year's National Day, there are two noteworthy and exciting things in our country's economic development: one is the communique issued by the State Statistical Bureau on the recovery and development of the national economy and cultural education in 1952, and the other is the discussions by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Central People's government on the general line of economic construction during the transition period in our country.
    According to the communique of the State Statistical Bureau, compared with 1951, the total output value of state-owned industries across the country increased by 45 percent, total grain output increased by 13 percent, cotton increased by 24 percent, the volume of freight sent by railway transport increased by 19 percent, the total value of domestic purchases by state-owned commercial enterprises increased by 56 percent, and the total sales value increased by 62 percent. The scale of national basic construction has also expanded, and the total investment completed by the six central industrial ministries last year increased by 210 percent compared with 1951. Along with the development of the national economy, cultural and educational undertakings have also grown significantly, and the lives of workers and farmers across the country have been further improved.
    The rapid recovery of our country's economy should first of all be attributed to the people's democratic system, various people's democratic reforms, and the sincere and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to our country. Facts have proved that Chairman Mao's instructions in 1949 were completely correct: "As long as we continue to maintain the style of hard struggle, as long as we unite as one, as long as we adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship and unite international friends, we will be able to achieve rapid victory on the economic front." The people's democratic economy is led by the socialist economy, and the rapid development of our country's socialist economy guarantees the rapid recovery of the national economy. In 1952, the total output value of large-scale state-owned and joint state-private industries accounted for 66 percent of the total output value of large-scale industries in the country, and state-owned and cooperative businesses accounted for more than 50 percent of the total domestic commodity sales. In agriculture, although the individual economy of farmers still accounts for a large proportion, the movement of mutual assistance and cooperation among farmers has greatly developed. In 1952, the proportion of farmers organized through labor mutual assistance organizations generally accounted for more than 65 percent of the total number of farmers in the old liberated areas, and about 25 percent in the newly liberated areas. They have played a significant leading role in promoting the development of agricultural economy. Of course, the rapid recovery of the national economy directly relies on the creative labor of workers and farmers across the country, and the people's democratic system enables them to give full play to their high level of enthusiasm in labor. In 1952, after completing the national plan, employees of state-owned enterprises also created huge amounts of wealth in the production increase and economy practice campaign, making significant contributions to the country.
    If the communique of the State Statistical Bureau strengthened the confidence of the people across the country on the economic front, then the discussions of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Central People's Government on economic construction issues enabled the people across the country to further understand the direction of our country's progress during the transition period.
    What is the general line of our country during the transition period? We got a clear answer to this question from the slogans of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in celebration of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China: "Gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country over a fairly long period of time, and gradually realize the socialist transformation of the country's agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce." The slogan also mentioned the basic tasks of our country's first five-year construction plan starting this year: "Concentrate major efforts on developing heavy industry, establish the foundation for national industrialization and modernization of national defense; correspondingly cultivate construction talent, develop transportation, light industry, agriculture, and commerce; promote the cooperation of agriculture and handicrafts in a step-by-step manner, continue to transform private industry and commerce, correctly give play to the role of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce; ensure the steady growth of the proportion of socialist components in the national economy, and ensure the gradual improvement of the people's material and cultural life on the basis of developing production." This is a great and glorious historical task. It is like a lighthouse, illuminating the road for our people to move forward.
    This great and glorious historical task already had principled provisions in the Common Program, but after four years of development in the actual life of our people, it is now more specific than in the past.
    Four years ago, the Common Program passed by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulated long ago that in our country under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, uniting all democratic classes and people of all ethnic groups in the country, it is necessary to develop the new democratic people's economy and steadily transform the agricultural country into an industrial country. The industrial country mentioned here is certainly not a capitalist industrial country, but a socialist industrial country. Because the new democratic people's economy is the transitional economy that gradually transitions to socialism. Therefore, our country's industrialization must be and can only be socialist industrialization.
    Under this goal, the Common Program also specifically stipulates that the socialist state-owned economy is the leading force of the entire social economy; under its leadership, assist the development of the semi-socialist cooperative economy; encourage private capital to cooperate with the state economy and develop towards state capitalism; guide farmers to gradually organize various forms of labor mutual assistance and production cooperation according to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit; and encourage and support the broad masses of working people to develop cooperative undertakings according to the principle of voluntariness. These provisions are essentially the content of socialist transformation.
    In the past four years, our country has not only undergone multiple large-scale mass struggles, basically completed the democratic social reform work in all aspects; but also started the work of socialist transformation in the process of national economic recovery, making important changes in various economic components, and creating favorable conditions for gradually realizing socialist industrialization and gradually realizing socialist transformation in the future.
    At the meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteers and Vice Chairman Li Fuchun of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council respectively gave reports on the work of resisting the United States and aiding Korea and the negotiations with the Soviet government on the issue of Soviet assistance to our country's economic construction. These two reports have also received the attention and support of the people across the country. Our people insist on the faithful execution of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The United States government, on the contrary, is using all means to obstruct the fair execution of the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war and the smooth convening of the political conference. The stubborn stance of the United States government of not being willing to resolve international disputes and ease the international situation through peaceful consultation has made it increasingly isolated; while the completely consistent and just stance of our country, Korea, and the Soviet Union, as well as all people's democratic countries on the Korean issue, has received increasingly broad sympathy. The close and friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union has shown great development, especially in the matter of the Soviet Union assisting our country in building and rebuilding 141 large-scale enterprises. The gratitude of our people to the Soviet government has been fully conveyed in the telegram sent by Comrade Mao Zedong to Comrade Malenkov on September 15:
    "Because the great Soviet government has agreed to give systematic economic and technical assistance in the construction and reconstruction of the ninety-one new enterprises in China as well as the fifty enterprises that are being built and rebuilt, the Chinese people will be able to gradually establish their own powerful heavy industry in the effort to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and the latest technological achievements, which is of extremely important significance to China's industrialization, the gradual transition to socialism, and the strengthening of the forces of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union."
    Our people across the country are working hard to learn from the Soviet Union with a hundredfold confidence, under increasingly favorable international and domestic conditions, according to Chairman Mao's words, and striving to realize the great historical task of our country's industrialization and gradual transition to socialism.
    We are implementing the first annual plan of the first five-year plan. The implementation situation in the first half of the year is generally satisfactory. However, several products in individual industrial production departments have not completed the plan, and some departments have not completed the profit delivery plan; most of the basic construction projects are crowded into the second half of the year, and time is tight; agricultural production in some areas may remain at last year's level due to disasters; commercial sales tasks have also become heavier with the expansion of the market; and more than half of the tax revenue tasks need to be completed in the second half of the year. Therefore, the people across the country must make significant efforts to complete this year's national plan; and only by striving to complete and overfulfill this year's plan can we lay a solid foundation for the completion of next year's plan and the entire five-year plan.
    There are only three months left in this year. To ensure the completion and strive to exceed the plan in the last quarter, it is necessary to intensify the campaign to increase production and practice economy. Our campaign to increase production and practice economy is not only necessary to solve current problems, but also necessary for long-term construction in the future. In order to realize industrialization and develop heavy industry, we need a large amount of continuously increasing funds; and in order to obtain this fund, we can only gradually accumulate it from the increase in production and the economy in finance and production. The experience of the Soviet Union's accumulation of funds for socialist industrialization fully proves this.
    In his article "On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Policy of the Party" in 1926, Comrade Stalin said: "People sometimes forget that without a certain minimum amount of funds, without a certain minimum amount of reserves, it is impossible to formulate any industrial plan or to build such or such 'large-scale' and 'all-encompassing' enterprises." This is also an extremely important instruction for us. We must have an increasing accumulation of wealth and sufficient reserves, and concentrate on using them, in order to carry out the construction of national socialist industrialization.
    Currently, state-owned enterprises and institutions in major administrative regions and most provinces and cities across the country have held meetings, put forward methods to increase production and practice economy, and stipulated specific figures for increasing production and practicing economy. For example, the national railway system has proposed to increase production and practice economy by 4.1 trillion yuan this year, industrial and mining enterprises in Beijing have formulated a plan to increase production and practice economy by 1.2 trillion yuan, Tianjin has planned to increase production and practice economy by 2 trillion yuan, state-owned factories in Shenyang City in the Northeast have planned to increase production and practice economy by 1.7 trillion yuan, Anshan Iron and Steel Company and other state-owned industries in Anshan have put forward a plan to increase production and practice economy by 900 billion yuan, and the Shanghai factories under the East China Textile Administration have decided to increase production by 320 billion yuan in the fourth quarter of this year. Other places have also put forward planned figures. The broad masses of workers, farmers, and staff members are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Party and the government and actively struggling to increase production, practice economy, and overfulfill the 1953 plan. The current task is to rapidly develop and deepen this movement and make it a lasting movement for the broader masses.
    In all public and private enterprises, we should combine increasing production and practicing economy with improving enterprise management. When launching and organizing labor emulation drives, we should not disrupt the original work arrangements, but rather further improve the operation and management of the enterprise in accordance with the original work arrangements. That is to say, we should not simply and hastily increase production and practice economy by means of overtime and shock production, but must start from strengthening management work, that is, from establishing and improving plan management, technical management, responsibility system, and economic accounting, etc., to improve labor productivity, reduce costs, and increase production. In state-owned enterprises, if labor productivity increases by 10 percent each year, then about 60 percent of the total value of products in five years will be due to the increase in labor productivity. If costs can be reduced by 1 percent each year, the funds accumulated in five years will be equivalent to the investment in building three factories with an annual output of 30,000 cars. How much are these funds needed for our country's new construction projects!
    Of course, when formulating production increase plans, we must also pay attention to maintaining a balance between the supply of raw materials, the sales of products, and the various parts of production, and not blindly increase production, so as to avoid wasting the country's wealth.
    All basic construction projects should currently concentrate efforts on major engineering projects and construction projects that are decisive for next year's production increase, ensuring that they are completed according to plan and ensuring the quality of construction. All secondary projects that should be postponed or reduced should be resolutely postponed or reduced after research and review. However, projects that have entered a tense stage of construction should not be hastily stopped to avoid waste; at the same time, proper measures should be taken to reduce the cost of construction and installation, and save funds for the country.
    The national finance and taxation departments have a major responsibility to grasp the budget, complete the tax revenue task, and prevent tax evasion; the commercial system must earnestly strive to complete the state's procurement plan, and systematically do a good job in sales work, accelerate capital turnover, reduce circulation costs, maintain reasonable reserves, and resolutely fight against the illegal activities of some private merchants who speculate and make illegal purchases.
    In rural areas, it is necessary to earnestly protect the interests of farmers, continuously consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, further closely connect with the broadest masses of farmers, gradually promote advanced agricultural technology, develop mutual assistance and cooperation, increase the yield of grain and other crops, and overcome natural disasters and difficulties in farmers' production, according to local conditions and mass experience. Currently, it is especially necessary to seize the leadership of autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing, and strive to increase the harvest of grain and cotton, and pay attention to saving grain consumption, and mobilize farmers to sell more surplus grain to the state to support the country's construction.
    All state organs and the army, as well as all staff members, must do their best to serve the needs of national construction, do their best to save manpower, materials, and financial resources, and earnestly realize one of the conditions for the fundamental improvement of our country's financial and economic situation instructed by Chairman Mao in June 1950, that is, "the massive reduction of expenses required by state organs."
    Everyone will understand that only under the condition that our people's current lives have been improved, can we do our best to increase production and practice economy to build our country's industry, especially heavy industry, in order to develop agriculture on a large scale, and fundamentally improve the lives of workers, farmers, and all the people. This is where the long-term interests lie; only by subordinating the partial interests of our current lives to the long-term interests of the country's socialist industrialization, is this the highest and fundamental interest of all the people. The great and glorious historical task is calling us, let us advance bravely for the lofty goal of socialist industrialization! (Attached picture)

    为着社会主义工业化的远大目标而奋斗
    ——庆祝中华人民共和国成立四周年
    中华人民共和国已经成立四年了。在这四年中，我国人民在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导之下，已经彻底打倒了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的血腥统治，使黑暗的旧中国变为光明的人民民主的新中国。工人成了国家的领导阶级，农民得到了土地和其他经济的政治的重大利益，知识分子已经可以把自己的知识贡献于国家的建设，人民的生活已经得到普遍的逐步的改善。我们的国家已经完全独立和统一，各民族人民都团结在自由平等的大家庭中间。我国人民民主制度一天比一天更加完备，基层的普选已经在今年开始了。我们和伟大的苏联人民结成了巩固的同盟，和英勇的朝鲜人民一起打退了美帝国主义对朝鲜的侵略，并且胜利地实现了停战。我们在一九五二年完成了经济恢复工作，在一九五三年进入了有计划的经济建设的第一年。由于这一切，在庆祝中华人民共和国成立第四周年的时候，在我们的心中是怎样充满着对于旧时代的痛恨，对于新时代的感激和热爱啊！在我们的眼前是怎样展开着对于将来的幸福生活的希望，为着实现这样的希望我们甘愿再付出多少辛苦的劳动啊！
    在今年国庆节的前夜，在我国经济发展方面有两件令人注意和兴奋的事：一件是国家统计局发表了一九五二年国民经济和文化教育恢复与发展情况的公报，一件是人民政协全国委员会和中央人民政府委员会讨论了我国过渡时期的经济建设的总路线。
    根据国家统计局的公报，以一九五二年和一九五一年相比，全国国营工业的总产值增加了百分之四十五，粮食总产量增加了百分之十三，棉花增加了百分之二十四，铁道运输发送货物吨数增加了百分之一十九，国营商业国内收购总值增加了百分之五十六，销售总值增加了百分之六十二。国家基本建设的规模也扩大了，去年中央六个工业部完成的投资总数，较一九五一年增加了百分之二百一十。随着国民经济的发展，文化教育事业也有显著的增长，全国职工和农民的生活也得到进一步的改善。
    我国经济的迅速恢复，首先应当归功于人民民主制度、各种人民民主的改革和苏联对我国的真诚无私的援助。事实证明了毛主席在一九四九年的指示的完全正确：“只要我们仍然保持艰苦奋斗的作风，只要我们团结一致，只要我们坚持人民民主专政和团结国际友人，我们就能在经济战线上迅速地获得胜利。”人民民主的经济是以社会主义经济为领导力量的，我国社会主义经济的迅速发展保障了国民经济的迅速恢复。一九五二年国营和公私合营的大型工业的总产值，占全国大型工业总产值的百分之六十六，国营和合作社商业在国内商品销售总额中约占百分之五十以上。在农业方面，虽然农民的个体经济还占极大成份，但是农民的互助合作运动已有很大发展。一九五二年通过劳动互助组织起来的农户，在老解放区，一般占农户总数的百分之六十五以上；在新解放区，一般占百分之二十五左右。在推动农业经济的发展方面，它们已起了显著的带头作用。当然，国民经济的迅速恢复直接地是依靠全国职工和农民的创造性劳动，人民民主制度使他们在劳动中发挥了高度的积极性。在一九五二年，国营企业职工在完成国家计划以后，还在增产节约运动中创造了巨量的财富，对国家作了重大的贡献。
    如果说国家统计局的公报坚定了全国人民在经济战线上的信心，那么，人民政协全国委员会和中央人民政府委员会关于经济建设问题的讨论就使得全国人民进一步了解了我国在过渡时期的前进方向。
    我国在过渡时期的总路线是什么呢？这个问题，我们从人民政协全国委员会在庆祝中华人民共和国成立四周年的口号中得到了明确的答复：“在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对私营工商业的社会主义改造”。口号中还说到了从今年开始的我国第一个五年建设计划的基本任务：“集中主要力量发展重工业，建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础；相应地培养建设人材，发展交通运输业、轻工业、农业和商业；有步骤地促进农业、手工业的合作化，继续进行对私营工商业的改造，正确地发挥个体农业、手工业和私营工商业的作用；保证国民经济中社会主义成份的比重稳步增长，保证在发展生产的基础上逐步提高人民物质生活和文化生活的水平。”这是一个伟大的光荣的历史任务。它像一座灯塔，照耀着我国人民前进的道路。
    这一伟大的光荣的历史任务在共同纲领中已经有了原则的规定，只是经过四年来我国人民实际生活的发展，现在它比过去更加具体了。
    四年以前，中国人民政治协商会议通过的共同纲领，早已规定了在工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的、团结各民主阶级和国内各民族的人民民主专政的我国，必须发展新民主主义的人民经济，稳步地变农业国为工业国。这里所说的工业国，当然不是资本主义的工业国，而是社会主义的工业国。因为新民主主义的人民经济，就是逐步过渡到社会主义的过渡经济。所以，我国工业化必须是也只能是社会主义的工业化。
    在这个目标之下，共同纲领还具体规定了社会主义性质的国营经济为整个社会经济的领导力量；在它的领导之下，扶助半社会主义性质的合作社经济的发展；鼓励私人资本和国家经济合作，向国家资本主义方向发展；引导农民逐步地按照自愿和互利的原则，组织各种形式的劳动互助和生产合作；并鼓励和扶助广大劳动人民，根据自愿原则，发展合作事业。这些规定实质上就是社会主义改造的内容。
    四年以来，我国不但经过了多次大规模的群众斗争，在各方面基本上完成了民主的社会改革工作；而且在国民经济恢复的过程中，已经开始了社会主义改造的工作，使各种经济成份发生了重要的变化，创造了今后逐步实现社会主义工业化和逐步实现社会主义改造的有利条件。
    在中央人民政府委员会的会议上，中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀同志和政务院财经委员会副主任李富春同志分别作了关于抗美援朝工作的报告和与苏联政府商谈苏联对我国经济建设援助问题的报告。这两个报告也受到了全国人民的注意和拥护。我国人民坚持朝鲜停战协定的忠实执行和朝鲜问题的和平解决。美国政府与我们相反，它正在用一切方法阻挠关于战俘遣返协议的公正执行和政治会议的顺利召开。美国政府不愿意以和平协商来解决国际争端、缓和国际局势的顽固立场已经使它愈来愈孤立了；而我国、朝鲜和苏联以及一切人民民主国家在朝鲜问题上的完全一致的正义立场，则得到了一天比一天广泛的同情。中苏两国的亲密的友好合作，在苏联援助我国新建和改建一百四十一项规模巨大的企业这件事上，特别表现了巨大的发展。我国人民对于苏联政府的感谢，在毛泽东同志九月十五日给马林科夫同志的电报中充分地传达出来了：
    “由于伟大的苏联政府同意在建设和改建中国的九十一个新的企业以及正在建设和改建的五十个企业中给以系统的经济的和技术的援助，中国人民将能够在学习苏联的先进经验和最新技术成就的努力之下，逐步地建立起自己的强大的重工业，这对于中国工业化、使中国逐步地过渡到社会主义和壮大以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，都具有极其重大的作用。”
    我们全国人民正以百倍的信心，在国际和国内的日益有利的条件下，照着毛主席的话，努力学习苏联，为实现我国工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义的伟大历史任务而奋斗。
    我们正在执行第一个五年计划的第一个年度计划。上半年的执行情况，一般说来是令人满意的。但在个别工业生产部门中有几种产品没有完成计划，也有些部门的利润上缴计划没有完成；基本建设工程大部分挤在下半年，时间很紧；农业生产方面有一部分地区因遭受灾害，收成可能还停留在去年的水平上；商业因市场扩大，销售任务也随着加重；税收任务有半数以上要在下半年内加紧完成。因此，全国人民必须做重大的努力，才能完成本年度的国家计划；而我们只有努力完成和超额完成本年度的计划，才能为明年的计划和整个五年计划的完成打下稳固的基础。
    本年度的时间只剩下三个月了。要在最后一个季度内保证完成并争取超过计划，就必须加紧开展增产节约运动。我们的增产节约运动不但是解决目前的问题所必需的，而且也是今后长期建设所必需的。为要实现工业化，为要发展重工业，我们需要有不断增加的大量资金；而为要得到这个资金，我们只能从生产的增加和财政上、生产上的节约来逐渐积累。苏联社会主义工业化资金积累的经验，完全证明了这一点。
    斯大林同志一九二六年在“论苏联经济状况和党的政策”一文中说：“人们有时忘记了，没有一定的最低限度的资金，没有一定的最低限度的后备，既不可能制订任何工业计划，也不能建设这样或那样‘规模宏大’和‘包罗万象’的企业。”这对于我们同样是极其重要的指示。我们必须要有日益增长的财富积累和充分的后备金，并集中地加以使用，才有可能进行国家社会主义工业化的建设。
    目前全国各大行政区和多数省、市的国营企业和机关都召开了会议，提出了增产节约的办法，规定了增产节约的具体数字。例如全国铁路系统提出在本年内增产节约四万一千亿元，北京市各工矿企业拟定了增产节约一万二千亿元的计划，天津市拟定增产节约两万亿元，东北沈阳市各国营工厂计划增产节约一万零七百亿元的财富，鞍山钢铁公司及鞍山市其他国营工业提出了增产节约九千亿元的计划，华东纺织管理局所属上海各厂决定在今年第四季度内增产三千二百亿元，其他各地也都纷纷提出计划数字。广大的工人、农民和机关工作人员踊跃地响应着党和政府的号召，积极地为增产节约、超额完成一九五三年计划而斗争。现在的任务是要把这个运动迅速开展起来和深入下去，使它成为更广大群众的持久的运动。
    在一切公私企业中，我们应该使增产节约和改善企业管理相结合。在发动和组织劳动竞赛的时候，不应打乱原来的工作部署，而要按照原来的工作部署，进一步改善企业的经营管理工作。这就是说，不应简单地草率地用加班加点突击生产的办法去增产节约，而必须从加强管理工作，即从建立和健全计划管理、技术管理、责任制度和经济核算等工作入手，来提高劳动生产率，降低成本，增加生产。在国营企业中，如果劳动生产率每年增加百分之十，那末，五年的产品总值就有百分之六十左右是由于提高劳动生产率得来的。如果每年能降低成本百分之一，五年中所积累的资金，就等于建造三个年产三万辆汽车的工厂的投资。这些资金对于我国新的建设工程是何等的需要啊！
    当然，在制订增产计划时，还必须注意使原材料的供应、产品的销路和各部分生产保持平衡，而不要盲目地增产，以免反而浪费国家的财富。
    各项基本建设目前应集中力量在主要的工程项目和对明年的增产有决定意义的建设项目上，保证它们按计划完成，并保证施工的质量。所有应该推迟的或应该削减的次要项目，经过研究审查之后，就要坚决予以推迟或削减。但施工已经进入紧张阶段的项目就不应该草率停工，以免造成浪费；同时要采取妥善的办法，降低建筑安装的成本，为国家节约资金。
    国家财政和税收部门负有重大的责任去掌握预算，完成税收任务，防止偷税漏税；商业系统要切实努力完成国家的收购计划，并有计划地做好销售工作，加速资金周转，降低流转费用，保持合理的储备，并向一部分私商投机套购的不法行为作坚决的斗争。
    在农村中要切实保护农民利益，不断地巩固工农联盟，进一步密切联系最广大的农民群众，根据当地的条件和群众经验，逐步地推广先进的农业技术，发展互助合作，提高粮食和其他农作物的产量，战胜自然灾害和农民生产中的困难。目前特别要抓紧领导秋收、秋耕、秋种工作，努力增加粮食和棉花的收获量，并注意节省粮食的消费，动员农民把更多的余粮卖给国家，以支援国家的建设。
    所有的国家机关和军队以及一切工作人员，都必须尽力服从国家建设的需要，尽力节约人力、物力和财力，认真实现毛主席在一九五○年六月所指示的我国财政经济根本好转的条件之一，即“国家机构所需经费的大量节减”。
    人人都会懂得，只有在我国人民现时生活已经有所改善的条件下，尽力增产节约，去建设我国的工业特别是重工业，才能大规模地发展农业，才能从根本上改善工人、农民和全体人民的生活，这是长远的利益所在；只有把我们眼前生活中的局部的利益，服从于国家社会主义工业化的长远的利益，这才是全体人民最高的根本的利益。伟大的光荣的历史任务正在召唤着我们，让我们为着社会主义工业化的远大目标而奋勇前进吧！（附图片）
