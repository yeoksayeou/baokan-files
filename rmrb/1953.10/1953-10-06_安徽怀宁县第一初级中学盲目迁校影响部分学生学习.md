    Anhui Huaining County No. 1 Junior High School's Blind Relocation Affects Some Students' Studies
    Ling Song of the Zhenghe District People's Government of Huaining County, Anhui Province, writes: The Department of Culture and Education of the Anhui Provincial People's Government rashly approved the relocation of Huaining County No. 1 Junior High School, wasting financial resources and affecting the studies of some students in the area.
    Huaining County No. 1 Junior High School is located in Gugeng Dam, Huangma Township, Zhenghe District of the county. The school building was converted from a ancestral hall and the school site is spacious. After several renovations since liberation, the construction cost for the second half of last year alone reached 100 million yuan; a new house was added near the school, and the school buildings are ample enough. However, Tang Zijing, the principal of the school, requested the special commissioner's office to approve the relocation on the grounds that "the wood is rotten, the walls are crooked, there are many termites," and "fearing collapse and misfortune." We and experienced people have personally examined the school building and found that the structure is strong and will not suffer any "misfortune" even if it is not repaired for five years. However, the Huaining County Culture and Education Section and the Anqing Special Commissioner's Office Culture and Education Section agreed with the school principal's opinion, and the Anhui Provincial Department of Culture and Education also approved the relocation of the school and allocated 26 million yuan for transportation costs. The school was moved to Jiangjiazui, Jiangzhen District, Huaining County on August 19. The new school site is very close to middle schools in Anqing, Huaining, Susong, and Wangjiang. We believe that it is meaningless to move Huaining County Junior High School to a place where schools are concentrated. Because the original location of the school was appropriate, east to Anqing, west to Qianshan, south to Huaining, and north to Tongcheng, within a radius of nearly a hundred miles, this was the only middle school. After the relocation, it is very difficult for rural students near Zhenghe District, especially children of poor and lower-middle peasants, to continue their studies. For example, Dong Yuren, a day student in the third grade, and Wang Guijun, a day student in the second grade, dropped out of school because they had no money to go to the new school. I hope the higher-level government will carefully study and deal with this matter.

### 安徽怀宁县第一初级中学盲目迁校影响部分学生学习

    安徽怀宁县第一初级中学盲目迁校影响部分学生学习
    安徽省怀宁县郑河区人民政府凌松来信：安徽省人民政府文教厅轻率批准怀宁县第一初级中学迁校，浪费了财力，并影响了该地部分学生的学习。
    怀宁县第一初级中学位于该县郑河区黄马乡古埂坝。校舍系由一个祠堂改建，校址宽大。解放后经过几次修建，仅去年下半年修建费即达一亿几千万元；学校附近并增添了一所新房，校舍充分够用。但该校校长唐子竟竟在“木朽壁歪，白蚁虫多”，“恐遇倒塌，将遭不幸”的藉口下，要求专署批准迁移。我们曾和有经验的人亲自看过，校舍结构坚固，即使五年不修也不会遭到什么“不幸”。可是怀宁县文教科和安庆专署文教科却同意了该校校长的意见，安徽省文教厅也批准该校移址，并支拨了二千六百万元的搬运费。该校于八月十九日已迁到怀宁县江镇区江家咀，新校址距离安庆、怀宁、宿松、望江等中学很近。我们认为把怀宁县立初级中学迁移到学校集中的地方去，是毫无意义的。因为该校原来地点适中，东至安庆，西到潜山，南至怀宁，北到桐城，方圆近百里范围之内，只有这一所中学。迁移以后，郑河区附近农村学生，尤其是贫雇农子女，要继续入学学习就有很大困难。如三年级走读生董玉仁、二年级走读生汪贵均等因无钱到新校舍去读书而失学。我希望上级政府对这件事慎重研究处理。
