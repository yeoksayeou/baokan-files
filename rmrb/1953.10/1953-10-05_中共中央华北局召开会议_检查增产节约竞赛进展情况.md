    The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau Holds Meeting to Review the Progress of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign

    [This newspaper reported] The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau convened a meeting on September 29th to review the progress of the increase production and practice economy movement in the industrial, capital construction, and railway transportation sectors.

    The meeting’s review indicated that the increase production and practice economy competition had fully unfolded in North China. In early September, the provinces and cities of North China held various meetings to deploy the increase production and practice economy movement and put forward specific requirements for increasing production and practicing economy. Preliminary statistics show that the industrial sector of the entire region can increase production and practice economy by 14,144.2 million yuan throughout the year. Currently, most factories, mines, workshops, and teams have formulated or are discussing their specific plans, and they are discussing, planning, and acting simultaneously, resulting in a steady improvement in production. According to statistics of ten products in early September, five exceeded the plan, and one was close to completing the plan. According to statistics of ten products in mid-September, six exceeded the plan, and four were close to completing the plan. At present, the increase production and practice economy competition is developing in depth throughout the region. The Tianjin Bicycle Factory, Shijingshan Power Plant, Qinghe Woolen Mill, Taiyuan Machinery Factory, and North China First Construction Company have carried out the movement relatively well. Their main features are: (1) The ideological mobilization is extensive, in-depth, practical, and timely; (2) The implementation of the national plan has been carefully checked, weak links have been discovered, key problems have been identified, and specific measures have been proposed. On this basis, a plan to over fulfill the national economic indicators has been formulated and specifically incorporated into the operational plan; (3) The spirit of mobilizing, discussing plans, and acting simultaneously is implemented, without mechanically dividing stages; (4) Attention is paid to mobilizing technical personnel and staff to participate in the competition, and attention is paid to promoting advanced experience and solving safety and quality issues; (5) Model figures and model deeds among employees are commended and rewarded at any time.

    Based on the above situation, the meeting emphasized that in October, the increase production and practice economy competition must be further heightened throughout the region. In order to guide the correct development of the movement, it is first necessary to continue to conduct extensive and in-depth ideological mobilization, mobilize all employees to participate in the increase production and practice economy competition; repeatedly explain to the masses of employees the important significance of increasing production and practicing economy for our country's economic construction, and promptly commend the advanced thinking and advanced deeds of advanced figures to stimulate the competitive enthusiasm of all employees. In the course of the competition, it is necessary to constantly overcome all conservative ideas (which are the main ones at present) and rash and reckless emotions.

    The meeting pointed out that local party committees should continue to review the increase production and practice economy plans of various grassroots units. Some plans that are set too low must be raised; plans that are difficult to complete even with effort must be revised; plans that do not have guarantee measures must be enriched; plans that have not been discussed by the masses must be submitted to the masses for discussion. In the review of the plan, attention should be paid to the balance of supply, production, and sales, and the supply and sales problems should be solved with a positive attitude.

    The meeting pointed out that the increase production and practice economy competition must tightly grasp the three links of improving enterprise management, promoting advanced experience, and improving product quality, and improve one step on the original basis, and never disrupt the original work deployment. At present, the most important thing is to introduce some advanced experience so that everyone can learn specific methods for conducting the competition correctly.

    The meeting pointed out that since August, accidents have been occurring continuously in various places. The problems of safe power supply in some power departments and the lack of flexible dispatching in the transportation departments directly affect the completion of the increase production and practice economy plans of various units. The meeting required all localities to take effective measures to prevent the occurrence of accidents. The meeting finally pointed out that in the leadership of increase production and practice economy, while strengthening the unified leadership of the Party, the due leadership role of various organizational systems should be strengthened to give play to the strength of all parties and establish a normal working order. The work of the Party Committee's Industrial Department should be strengthened, and a regular office meeting should be established with the Industrial Department as the main body, absorbing comrades from relevant departments to exchange information and solve problems in a timely manner. Each province and city can also issue publications to guide the competition.

    中共中央华北局召开会议
    检查增产节约竞赛进展情况
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局在九月二十九日召开会议，检查了工业、基本建设和铁路运输等部门的增产节约运动进展的情况。
    会议检查的情况说明：华北各地的增产节约竞赛已全面展开。九月初，华北各省、市召开了各种会议，布置增产节约运动，并提出了增产节约的具体要求。初步统计，全年全区工业部门可增产节约一万四千一百四十四点二亿元。目前大部厂矿、车间、小组已订出或正在讨论自己的具体计划，并且一边讨论，一边计划，一边行动，使生产情况日见好转。据九月上旬十种产品的统计，五种超额完成计划，一种接近完成计划。九月中旬十种产品统计，六种超额完成计划，四种接近完成计划。目前全区增产节约竞赛运动正在深入发展。天津自行车厂、石景山发电厂、清河制呢厂、太原机器厂、华北第一建筑公司等单位的运动开展得比较好，其主要特点是：（一）思想动员广泛深入，切实及时；（二）认真地检查了执行国家计划的情况，发现了薄弱环节，找到了关键问题，提出了具体措施；在这一基础上制订出超额完成国家各项经济指标的计划，并把它具体列入作业计划中；（三）贯彻了边动员、边讨论计划、边行动的精神，不机械划分阶段；（四）注意发动技术人员和职员参加竞赛，注意推广先进经验和解决安全质量问题；（五）随时对职工中的模范人物、模范事迹进行表扬奖励。
    会议根据以上情况，着重指出：十月份必须使全区增产节约竞赛运动进一步高涨起来。为着指导运动正确发展，首先要继续进行广泛深入的思想动员，发动全体职工参加增产节约竞赛；反复向职工群众说明增产节约对我国经济建设的重要意义，并及时表扬先进人物的先进思想和先进事迹，以激发所有职工的竞赛热情。在竞赛过程中要不断克服一切保守思想（目前这是主要的）和急躁蛮干情绪。
    会议指出，各地党委要继续审查各基层单位的增产节约计划。有些订得太低的计划必须提高；凡经过努力也难以完成的计划必须修改；凡没有保证措施的计划必须充实；凡未经群众讨论的计划必须交群众来讨论。在审查计划中，应注意供、产、销平衡，并以积极的态度解决供应和销售问题。
    会议指出，增产节约竞赛必须紧紧地抓住改善企业管理、推广先进经验和提高产品质量等三个环节，在原有基础上提高一步，绝不要打乱原工作部署。目前最主要的是介绍些先进经验，以使大家学到正确的进行竞赛的具体办法。
    会议指出，八月份以来各地事故不断发生，有些电业部门的安全供电和交通运输部门调度不灵的问题，直接影响着各单位增产节约计划的完成。会议要求各地采取有效措施防止事故的发生。会议最后指出，在增产节约的领导上，要在加强党的统一领导的同时，加强各组织系统应有的领导作用，以发挥各方面的力量，建立正常的工作秩序。党委工业部工作应当加强，并以工业部为主，吸收有关部门的同志建立定期的办公例会，及时交换情况，解决问题。各省市并可印发指导竞赛的刊物。
