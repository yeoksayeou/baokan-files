    Speed
    ——A Record of a Visit to Team 241 of the Central Geological Department, Part 3 Fan Rongkang
    Zhang Jianxun, an old drilling worker with more than twenty years of experience, once told me his story. More than twenty years ago, the coal city of Fushun was still called Qianjinzhai, and twenty-year-old Zhang Jianxun was a laborer in the mine. At that time, the method of digging wells was still used for drilling holes, and later a machine drill came, which people called a diamond drill. Soon, Zhang Jianxun transferred to the drilling machine as an apprentice. Year after year passed, he did odd jobs here and there, and learned very little technique. It wasn't until seven or eight years had passed that Zhang Jianxun became the head of a drilling team. Naturally, this was not because Zhang Jianxun didn't want to learn the technique, or learned it poorly, but because it was not easy to learn the technique in that old society, and even after mastering the technique, it was not easy to be appreciated by others.
    When Zhang Jianxun brought the first drilling machine to Team 241, several masters had estimated that it would take a year and a half to train an apprentice into a technician. The speed of one and a half years is naturally greatly shortened compared to Zhang Jianxun's experience. However, there was such a thing: the first batch of apprentices in Team 241 did not wait for a year and a half. Due to their proficiency in drilling machine operation, they not only became technicians, but also could be competent for the position of team leader.
    The people of Team 241 like to talk about their Jiang Peining. This nineteen-year-old drilling team leader came to Team 241 in July 1951, and was promoted to team leader in October of the following year. Jiang Peining was not more familiar with drilling machines than others. Before coming to Team 241, he was just an ordinary young farmer. He had never seen a drilling machine. When he first arrived at Team 241, he, like many others, lacked confidence in his work. However, once he made up his mind to learn, it didn't take him long to get the hang of it. Soon, Jiang Peining became a team leader.
    However, compared to the later batch of apprentices, Jiang Peining's speed was not the fastest. Now many drilling machine team leaders in Team 241 have only seen a drilling machine for a few months. Fu Rang, the leader of Team Fifteen, is one of them. Last year, Fu Rang was still an apprentice in a fur shop. When he came to Team 241 in August, he didn't even know what a drilling machine looked like. Soon, he was transferred to a drilling machine. The team leader entrusted many things to him and taught him. How intensely his heart beat when he first held the feed handle. He only saw the drill pipe drilling rapidly, and the drilling machine making a roaring sound, but he could not listen to the sound of the earth's heart from the feed handle, from the movement of the drilling machine. What changes were there in the rock? How much sand should be added? How much water should be given? At that time, he could not understand. The only reassuring thing was that the team leader stood beside him, taking the feed handle from his hand from time to time, and pointing out to him at any time how the underground situation was reflected. Later, the number of times Fu Rang held the feed handle gradually increased, and he began to discover that the team leader had stopped standing by his side at all times since he didn't know when. Soon after, Fu Rang was promoted to team leader. Now, it is Fu Rang's turn to stand by and teach the new apprentices the operation of the feed handle step by step, just like the old master taught him a few months ago.
    Not only did Fu Rang become a team leader quickly, but all the apprentices who came to Team 241 with Fu Rang also became team leaders quickly. We can explain it this way: the drilling business has developed too fast, and many team leaders need to be promoted; but we must also recognize that as long as we step up the training of them, the speed at which they master the technology can be adapted to the speed of the development of the drilling business.
    Speaking of speed, we cannot fail to mention the geophysical prospecting team. When a group of university physics graduates were assigned to the Ministry of Geology to do geophysical prospecting work last year, some geophysical prospecting workers believed that geophysical prospecting itself was not yet a very mature science, and could not yet serve the motherland, and had to be studied for a period, and what could university graduates study? Before that, when a university physics graduate participated in geophysical prospecting work, it took three months just to set up a tripod, and then he could operate a theodolite and a magnetometer. Now it seems that these are all jokes. Geophysical prospecting has played a significant role in geological exploration, and its own level is gradually improving in practice. The magnetometer has increased from more than 20 measurement points per day in the past to more than 400 measurement points. The university graduates who graduated last year are not only useful, but many have become team leaders. In particular, the work of setting up tripods is now done by ordinary workers. As for operating theodolites and magnetometers, they are not university physics graduates, but students with junior high school level, or even higher elementary school level. They are now the main force of geophysical prospecting. This is the case in the geophysical prospecting team of Team 241, and also in the geophysical prospecting teams of other geological exploration teams.
    The trainees of the geophysical prospecting team of Team 241 had no idea a few months ago that they would become so useful to the motherland.
    Among this group of trainees is a girl named Sheng Genyu. She is only nineteen years old this year and is from Shanghai. She originally did not know that there was a science called geophysical prospecting, nor did she know what geological work was. Except for climbing Kunshan when she went on an outing, she had never seen a mountain again. The reason why she applied for the training class of the Central Geological Department was only for a very simple reason: she felt that she had reached the time when she should not be sitting at home eating.
    A few months ago, during her study life in the training class, Sheng Genyu cried in her quilt because she had not seen her mother for a short time, and the organization did not approve her request for leave. When the training class ended, and the organization assigned her to Team 241, she was embarrassed to refuse the work assigned to her. She thought, why don't others raise opinions, but she has to raise opinions? In this way, she came to the grassland that she had never thought of. When she knew that her work was part of the entire economic construction undertaking, and when she understood some revolutionary truths, she settled down, and her work made great progress. Later, she became the deputy leader of the magnetometer group. And all of this happened in just a few months.
    Countless such ordinary, and still very immature people have mastered technology and improved technology at a rapid speed, so that the national economic construction undertaking can advance rapidly.
    However, the formation of such a speed has a process, and it is also tortuous. The geological department of Team 241 has had a tortuous process in training geological trainees.
    This year, the geological department of Team 241 has successively absorbed more than twenty trainees, most of whom are office cadres, demobilized soldiers, and unemployed intellectuals. These people are very enthusiastic, and they can't wait to become geological engineers in one morning. In this way, some trainees put learning and work in opposition, keen on learning, requiring large classes every day, learning theory, and unwilling to do practical operations. The leaders also lacked experience, and the direction of training trainees was not clear. At that time, it was stipulated that trainees should rotate a work project every week, in order to facilitate them to learn more things. As a result, they learned many things, but forgot as they learned, and the speed was very slow instead. On the one hand, the geological personnel thought that training trainees was a burden, and on the other hand, in the above situation, they had to train trainees for the sake of training trainees. At that time, there were already few geological personnel, and trainees were urgently needed to share some of the work, but because the direction was not right, it weakened the original technical strength even more. One geological team of three technical personnel drew one person specifically to explain the theory to the trainees.
    This situation obviously could not continue. The geological department of Team 241 accepted the lessons of this stage, clearly realized that learning and work must be combined, unified their thinking, and stipulated that trainees should rotate a work project every month. In the actual work, three methods were adopted: First, explain the purpose of each work item to the trainees. In the past, they would explain whatever they saw, so the explanation was fragmented, and they could not exert the trainees' understanding. Now, they explain the purpose of each work item clearly, for example, when filling in the geological map, they tell them why they want to fill in the geological map, and when they find an outcrop, they tell them the meaning of this outcrop and where there may be more outcrops. In this way, they improved their understanding and interest in the work. Second, assign some indoor work such as sorting specimens to the trainees, share the affairs of the technical personnel, and prevent the trainees from being idle when the field work is stopped. Third, after each field work is over, leave them homework, such as making a section, and then give them questions to make a section map, calculate the thickness of the rock formation, and when they encounter quartzite, give them questions to answer the role and genesis of quartzite. In this way, they have the opportunity to comprehensively, sort out and improve their daily perceptual knowledge.
    As a result of doing this, the trainees made rapid progress. They began to become familiar with their work and became assistants to the geological personnel. But this stage still has shortcomings, and has not resolutely arranged trainees from work. This is reflected in the fact that the trainees' work is still changed once a month and cannot be fixed. Hydrogeology is very important, and several trainees are needed to measure water wells, measure water levels, flow rates, flow directions, and make records, but in order to take care of the trainees' multi-faceted learning, they did not resolutely draw people to do it. Recently, after ideological summary, this situation was fundamentally reversed, and the trainees' work was completely allocated from the needs of the work, and no longer rotated. In addition, we must insist on doing a good job in the teaching of ordinary geology, combine with practical work, explain the basic common sense and theories of various geological work, so that trainees can not only be familiar with their own business, but also be familiar with the entire geological work step by step.
    Now, this group of trainees has become an indispensable force in the geological work of Team 241. Many of them already have the ability to work independently in one area.
    Everyone is progressing so fast, but people are not satisfied, they still have greater ambitions. Qian Ning, the deputy captain of the geophysical prospecting team of Team 241, told me that when she graduated from Tsinghua University last year, her classmates envied her for being able to catch up with the first year of the first five-year plan. Those students who had just entered the first grade, in addition to envy, also said: "Anyway, we can also catch up with the first five-year plan." But Qian Ning had her own ideas. She thought: "We don't want you to catch up - we want to complete the five-year plan in four years."
    I think, the five-year plan may be completed in four years, and the four-year study may also be completed in three years. Who is faster, remains to be concluded by the facts.

    速度
    ——中央地质部二四一队访问记之三  范荣康
    二十多年的老钻探工人张建勋曾告诉我他自己的故事。二十多年前，煤都抚顺还叫着千金寨，二十岁的张建勋就在矿山上当一名小工。当时，还沿用打水井的方法打钻眼，以后才来了一部机器钻机，人们称它为金刚钻。不久，张建勋转到钻机上当学工。一年一年地过去了，七零八碎地打杂，技术学得很少。一直过了七、八年，张建勋才当上钻机班长。自然，这并不是张建勋不想学技术，或学得很糟，而是在那个旧社会里不容易学到技术，在掌握了技术之后，也不容易得到别人的赏识。
    张建勋带着第一部钻机来到二四一队时，几个师傅曾核计过，打算一年半把学工培养成技工。一年半的速度和张建勋的经历比较起来，自然是大为缩短了。可是，就有这样的事情：二四一队最初的一批学工没有等到一年半的时间，由于对钻机操作的熟练，不仅使他们成为技工，而且可以胜任班长的职务。
    二四一队的人们喜欢谈到他们的姜培宁。这位十九岁的钻探班长是一九五一年七月来到二四一队的，第二年的十月就被提升为班长。姜培宁并不比其他人更熟悉钻机。在来到二四一队前，他只是一个普通的青年农民。他没有看见过钻机。当他初到二四一队的时候，正像其他许多人一样，对业务缺乏信心。可是，当他下了决心学习以后，并没有多久的时间就摸上门了。不久，姜培宁就当了班长。
    然而，比起后来的一批学工说来，姜培宁的速度又不是最快的了。现在二四一队许多钻机的班长，从他们第一次看到钻机到现在还只有几个月的时间。十五眼的班长傅让就是其中的一个。去年，傅让还是一家皮毛店里的学徒，八月里来到二四一队时，他还不知道钻机是什么样儿。不久，他被调到一部钻机上。班长把许多事情付托给他，教给他。当他第一次扶给进把的时候，心里跳动得多么厉害。只看见钻管飞快地钻动着，钻机发出轰轰的响声，可是却无法从给进把，从钻机的动静上来倾听土地心脏的声音。岩石有些什么变化？砂子应该投多少？水要给多少？那时，他都无法理解。唯一可以安心的是班长就站在身旁，不时把给进把从他的手中接过去，并且随时指点给他地下的情况是如何反映上来的。后来，傅让扶给进把的次数慢慢地增多了，并且他开始发现班长不知从什么时候起，不再寸步不离地站在身旁了。不久之后，傅让被提升为班长。现在，已经轮到傅让站在旁边，一步步地教那些新的学工掌握给进把的操作，就好像几个月前老师傅教他的时候一样。
    不仅是傅让很快地当了班长，和傅让一起到二四一队的所有的学工都很快地当了班长。我们可以这样来解释：钻探事业发展得太快了，需要提拔许多班长；但也不能不认识到：只要加紧培养他们，他们掌握技术的速度是可以和钻探事业发展的速度相适应的。
    提起速度，不能不提到物理探矿队。去年一批大学物理系的毕业生被分配到地质部做物理探矿工作时，有的物理探矿工作者认为物理探矿本身还是一门不很成熟的科学，还不能为祖国服务，先得研究一个时期，而大学毕业生能研究些什么呢？在那以前，一个大学物理系的毕业生参加物理探矿工作时，光摆三脚架就得摆三个月，然后才操作经纬仪和磁力仪。现在看来，这都是笑话了。物理探矿已经在地质勘探工作中发挥了显著的作用，它本身的水平也在实践中逐步提高。磁力仪已从过去一天做二十多测点提高到四百多测点，去年毕业的大学生不但有用，而且有许多当了队长。特别是摆三脚架的工作，现在是由普通的工人来做了，至于操作经纬仪和磁力仪的，也不是大学物理系的毕业生，而是初中程度，甚至是高小程度的学生。他们现在是物理探矿的主力。这在二四一队的物理探矿队是如此，在其他地质勘探队的物理探矿队里也是如此。
    二四一队物理探矿队的练习生们，在几个月以前是完全没有想到自己会成为对祖国这样有用的人的。
    在这批练习生里有一个叫盛根郁。她今年才十九岁，是上海人。她原不知道世界上有一种叫物理探矿的科学，也不知道什么是地质工作，除了在郊游的时候，她爬过崑山之外，再也没有见过山。她所以投考中央地质部的训练班，只因为一个很简单的理由：她觉得她已经到了不该坐在家里吃饭的时候了。
    几个月前，盛根郁在训练班的学习生活中，因很短的时间没有看见母亲，组织上没有批准她的请假要求，而睡在被窝里流泪。到了训练班结束，组织上分配她到二四一队时，她不好意思拒绝分配给她的工作。她想，为什么别人不提意见，她要提意见呢？这样，她来到从来没有想到过的草原上。当她知道她的工作是整个经济建设事业的一部分，当她懂得一些革命的道理之后，她安下心来，工作有了很大的进步。后来，她当了磁力仪组的副组长。而所有这一切事情，都发生在短短的几个月里。
    无数这样平凡的，在不久之前还很幼稚的人以迅速的速度掌握了技术，提高了技术，使国家经济建设事业得以迅速地前进。
    可是，形成这样的速度是有过程的，也是曲折的。二四一队地质科培养地质练习生就有过曲折的过程。
    二四一队地质科今年陆续吸收了二十多个练习生，他们大都是机关干部、转业军人和失业知识分子。这批人的热情很高，恨不得一个上午就变成地质工程师，这样有些练习生把学习和工作对立起来，热衷于学习，要求每天上大课，学理论，不愿意实际操作。领导上也没有经验，培养练习生的方向也不明确，当时规定的练习生每一星期轮换一个工作项目，以便于他们学到更多的东西，结果，学的样数不少，随学随忘，速度反而很慢。地质人员一方面认为培养练习生是负担，一方面在上述情况下不得不为培养练习生而培养练习生了。当时地质人员已够少了，迫切需要练习生分担一部分工作，但由于方向不对，反而更削弱了原有的技术力量。有一个地质小组三个技术人员就抽出一个人专门为练习生讲解理论。
    这种局面显然是不能继续下去的。二四一队地质科接受了这一阶段的教训，明确认识到必须把学习和工作结合起来，统一了思想，规定练习生每一个月轮换一个工作项目。在实际工作中采用了三个办法：第一，向练习生交代每一项工作的目的性，过去看见一样就讲一样，因而讲解得零碎，不能发挥练习生的理解力，现在把每一个工作的目的性交代清楚，例如填地质图时告诉他们为什么要填地质图，发现露头就告诉他们这个露头的意义和什么地方可能还有露头。这样，提高了他们对工作的认识和兴趣。第二，把一部分整理标本等室内工作交给练习生做，分担技术人员的事务，也不至让练习生在停止野外工作时闲着无事。第三，每一段野外工作结束后，给他们留作业，如作了剖面，就出题目让他们制剖面图，计算岩层厚度，遇到石英岩，就出题目让他们解答石英岩的作用及成因等问题。这样使他们对日常的感性认识有综合、整理和提高的机会。
    这样做的结果，练习生进步很快，他们开始熟悉自己的工作，成为地质人员的助手。但这一阶段还有缺点，还没有坚决从工作出发来安排练习生，这表现在练习生的工作还是一个月换一次，不能固定下来。水文地质很重要，需要几个练习生去量水井，测水位、流速、流向，作出记录，但为照顾练习生多方面的学习，没有坚决抽人去作。最近，经过思想总结，才根本扭转这个局面，完全从工作需要来分配练习生的工作，不再轮换。另外，坚持办好普通地质学的教授工作，结合实际工作，讲解各种地质工作的基本常识和理论，使练习生不仅能熟悉本身的业务，而且对整个地质工作，也有可能一步步地熟悉起来。
    现在，这批练习生已经成为二四一队地质工作中不可缺少的力量。其中许多人已经具备了在一个方面单独工作的能力。
    大家进步的速度这样快，但人们并不满足，他们还有更大的抱负。二四一队物理探矿队副队长钱宁告诉我说，她去年在清华大学毕业时，同学们都羡慕她能够赶上第一个五年计划的第一年。那些刚念一年级的同学在羡慕之余，又说：“反正我们也能赶上第一个五年计划。”但钱宁有她自己的想法。她想：“我们要不让你们赶上——我们要把五年计划四年完成”。
    我想，五年计划可能四年完成，四年学业也可能三年读完。究竟谁的速度更快些，还有待事实去作结论。
