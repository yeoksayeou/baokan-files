    Northwest District State-Owned Theaters Perform for Workers at Construction Sites
    The Northwest District state-owned theaters—Northwest People's Drama Troupe, Song and Dance Troupe, Qinqiang Opera Troupe, and Xi'an Yisu Society, Shaanxi Province Qinqiang Experimental Troupe, Meihu Opera Troupe, Gansu Province Qinqiang Experimental Troupe, Qinghai Province National Song and Dance Troupe, Ningxia Province Song and Dance Troupe, and Xinjiang Province Cultural Work Troupe—under the organization and leadership of the Northwest Cultural Bureau and cultural departments at all levels, successively gave a total of fifty-seven performances at factories, mines, and basic construction sites in the five cities of Xi'an, Lanzhou, Xining, Yinchuan, and Dihua, as well as in Xianyang, Tongchuan, Baqiao, and Baoji in Shaanxi Province, for an audience of more than 98,300 people.
    The troupes participating in this tour all set out after rectification, so the programs performed were also selected and rehearsed with relatively serious attention. The programs performed included: Qinqiang Opera "Touring Turtle Mountain," "Legend of the White Snake," "Mulan Joins the Army"; Meihu Opera "Twelve Sickles," "Everyone Likes It"; drama "Dawn Shines on Moscow," "The Embankment"; opera "Marriage." In addition, there were also short and pithy clapperdash, rhythmic storytelling, and dances of various ethnic minorities in the Northwest.

    西北区国营剧团——西北人民话剧团、歌舞剧团、秦腔剧团及西安市易俗社，陕西省秦腔实验剧团、郿鄠剧团，甘肃省秦腔实验剧团，青海省民族歌舞剧团，宁夏省歌舞剧团，新疆省文工团，在西北文化局及各级文化主管部门的组织与领导下，先后分别在西安、兰州、西宁、银川、迪化五市及陕西省咸阳、铜川、灞桥、宝鸡等地工、矿、基本建设工地，给工人巡回演出共计五十七场，观众达九万八千三百多人。
    这次巡回演出的剧团，都是在整顿以后出发演出的，因此演出的节目也是经过比较认真地选择与排演的。演出的节目有：秦腔“游龟山”、“白蛇传”、“木兰从军”；郿鄠“十二把镰刀”、“大家喜欢”；话剧“曙光照耀着莫斯科”、“堤”；歌剧“结婚”。此外，还有短小精悍的快板、数来宝及西北各少数民族的舞蹈等。
