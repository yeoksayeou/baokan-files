    Kailuan Coal Mine Must Strengthen
    Equipment Supply Management Work
    A letter from Yang Rui of the Kailuan Coal Mine Equipment Supply Department: The original plan for the Kailuan Coal Mine's equipment in the third quarter of this year included 2,705 items, but 488 items were added in July, 1,205 items were added in August, and 976 items were added in September (minor additions are not included in the statistics); the total number of added items reached more than 98% of the original planned items. The main reason for the large number of additions to the equipment plan is that many production units do not pay enough attention to accurately implementing the equipment plan. For example, the Linxi Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine added equipment plans ten times in July and August alone. Liu Guangqi, of the mine's supply section, said to the staff of the Equipment Supply Department: "It's the same whether there is an equipment plan or not. Anyway, you can't stop supplying us just because we don't have an equipment plan and stop us from producing coal." Tangjiazhuang Mine needs high-pressure rubber boots, electromagnets, and thin-diameter soft steel wire ropes, but it does not prepare an equipment plan in advance, and then just asks for them when needed. This situation is very common.
    The consumption of pit props and wood by the production departments exceeding the central quota is very serious. According to statistics for the first half of this year, the consumption of pit props and wood in the entire mining area exceeded the quota by 26.85%; among them, Linxi Mine exceeded by 48.89%, Tangshan Mine exceeded by 33.79%, and Zhaogezhuang Mine exceeded by 30.06%. This situation can be changed. The key lies in whether the leading cadres attach importance to this issue. For example, Tangjiazhuang Mine, due to its emphasis on the management of wood and the control of consumption figures, not only did not exceed the quota for pit props and wood, but also fell below the quota by 9.84%.
    Although the equipment supply management department of Kailuan Coal Mine has generally mastered the procurement and supply plans for major materials, it is completely clueless about auxiliary equipment. For example, the Equipment Supply Department of the mine does not know the types, newness, and other general conditions of the materials stored in the Linxi Mine's directly subordinate warehouse. Therefore, it cannot quickly dispose of stagnant materials and they are accumulated for a long time. A large batch of auxiliary equipment recently cleared in the warehouse, calculated according to the actual consumption figures of Linxi Mine in July, can supply the mine for one year and seven months.
    According to statistics, due to the inaccurate equipment plans of the production units and the cluelessness of the equipment supply management department, in the first half of this year alone, Kailuan Coal Mine purchased 800 extra coils of electric wire, 20 pieces of steel plates, safety wine lamps, spring steel, etc., totaling 7.26 billion yuan; the value of materials that the production departments could not use included one 500-horsepower motor, five electric locomotive heads, 200 coal cans, 85 tons of steel, 283 barrels of nails, and 30 sets of electric pole sticks... totaling more than 15.3 billion yuan; the amount of wood alone that exceeded the central government's prescribed reserve reached 9 billion yuan; the above items alone have accumulated state funds of more than 30 billion yuan. In addition, due to the serious conservatism and localism of some cadres, the disposal of stagnant equipment is not active enough. According to preliminary statistics, the stagnant equipment accumulated in the entire mine reached 32.9 billion yuan (excluding excess reserves of equipment and wood). In the first half of this year, only 4.9 billion yuan was disposed of.
  Equipment supply work is the material guarantee for completing the enterprise's production plan and is the first stage of production activities. If the supply is correct and reasonable, production can proceed smoothly; otherwise, it will affect production and cause waste. Kailuan Coal Mine is a large-scale production unit with many types of equipment used, and the turnover period of equipment supply is so long, and the average surplus of equipment in the warehouse is so large, which will inevitably affect the turnover of working capital and cause significant losses to state assets. In order to increase production and save, and to ensure the victorious and over-fulfilled completion of the state's production plan, I believe that vigorously improving and strengthening equipment plan management is a serious task for Kailuan Coal Mine at present.

### 开滦煤矿必须加强  器材供应管理工作

    开滦煤矿必须加强
    器材供应管理工作
    开滦煤矿器材供应处杨锐来信：开滦煤矿今年第三季度器材计划的项目原为二千七百零五项，但七月份就追加了四百八十八项，八月份追加了一千二百零五项，九月份又追加了九百七十六项（零星的追加还未统计在内）；追加项目总数达原计划项目的百分之九十八以上。许多生产单位对准确地执行器材计划重视不够，是造成器材计划项目大量追加的主要原因。仅开滦煤矿林西矿在七、八两月就追加了器材计划十次，该矿供应科刘光奇对器材供应处的工作人员说：“有器材计划和没器材计划都一样，反正你们不能因为我们没器材计划而停止供给，叫我们不出煤。”唐家庄矿需要高压胶皮靴、电磁和细径软钢丝绳，事前不编制器材计划，到时伸手就要。这种情况是很普遍的。
    生产部门坑木和木材的消耗量超过中央定额的情况很严重。根据今年上半年度的统计，全矿区坑木和木材的消耗共超过定额百分之二十六点八五；其中林西矿超过百分之四十八点八九，唐山矿超过百分之三十三点七九，赵各庄矿超过百分之三十点零六。这种情况是可以改变的，关键在于领导干部是否重视这个问题。如唐家庄矿由于重视了木材的管理和消耗数字的控制，因而坑木和木材的消耗不但没有超过定额，并且还低于定额百分之九点八四。
    开滦煤矿器材供应管理部门虽然大体上掌握了主要材料的采购和供应计划，但对辅助器材则是心中无数。如该矿器材供应处对林西矿直属仓库所存材料种类、新旧程度等一般情况都不知道，因此对于呆滞材料就无法迅速处理而长期积压着。最近在该库清查出的一大批辅助器材，按照七月份林西矿实际消耗数字来计算，可供该矿使用一年又七个月。
    据统计，由于生产单位的器材计划不准确和器材供应管理部门的心中无数，仅在今年上半年，开滦煤矿就多采购了电线八百盘，钢板、安全酒灯、弹簧钢等共二十件，折款七十二亿六千万元；所买生产部门不能用的物资有五百马力电动机一台、电车头五台、煤缶车二百辆、钢材八十五吨、钉子二百八十三桶、电柱棒三十套……，折款一百五十三亿余元；超过中央规定储备量的仅木材一项即达九十亿元；以上数项即积压国家资金达三百多亿元。此外，由于部分干部有着严重的保守思想和本位主义思想，对呆滞器材的处理不够积极，据初步统计，全矿积压的呆滞器材达三百二十九亿元（不包括超额储备的器材和木材），在今年上半年度仅处理了四十九亿元。
  器材供应工作是完成企业生产计划的物质保证，是生产活动的第一阶段。如供应得正确合理，生产就可以顺利进行；否则就会使生产受到影响和造成浪费。开滦煤矿是个大规模的生产单位，所用的器材种类很多，而器材供应周转期这样长，器材在仓库的平均剩余额这样大，就必然影响了流动资金的周转，使国家资财受到重大损失。为了增产节约，保证胜利地、超额地完成国家的生产计划，我认为大力改进和加强器材计划管理工作，是当前开滦煤矿的一个严重任务。
