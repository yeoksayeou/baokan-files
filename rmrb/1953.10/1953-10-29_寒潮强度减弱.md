    Cold Wave Intensity Weakens
    [Xinhua News Agency, October 28th] The Central Meteorological Observatory issued a cold wave message at 4:00 PM on the 28th:
    The main force of this year's first cold wave has crossed Inner Mongolia and entered Northeast China on the 28th and will continue to advance towards the Primorsky Krai of the Soviet Union. The intensity has been greatly reduced. In the next 24 hours, except for the Bohai Sea, the northern Yellow Sea, and the eastern coastal areas of the Shandong Peninsula, where there will still be winds of around force six, this cold wave will have no major impact on other areas.

    寒潮强度减弱
    【新华社二十八日讯】中央气象台二十八日下午四时发布寒潮消息：
    今年度第一次寒潮的主流，已经在二十八日越过我国内蒙进入东北，并将继续向苏联滨海省推进。强度已大为减弱。未来二十四小时内，除渤海海面、黄海北部海面及山东半岛东部沿海仍有六级左右大风外，此次寒潮对其他各地已无大影响。
