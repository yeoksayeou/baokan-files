    Regarding the Role of the Basic Economic Law of Socialism
    Soviet Union  Yi· Xizhelinikov
    Comrades Baomazijin, Mixiliangkov, Kunipov, and Xijikev, readers of Red Star Newspaper, wrote to request an explanation of the question concerning the role of the basic economic law of socialism.
    To correctly explain the emergence and function of the basic economic law of socialism, it is necessary to start from the principles of Marxist-Leninist science regarding the laws of social development and the laws of political economy.
    Marxism-Leninism teaches that the foundation for the emergence and operation of economic laws is the economic conditions and economic life of society, which are always in a state of constant development, movement, and change. If certain economic conditions change and disappear, then the economic laws generated by those economic conditions will also disappear and lose their effectiveness, and new economic laws will emerge and function on the basis of new economic conditions.
    When did the basic economic law of socialism begin to function?
    Some comrades assert that the basic economic law of socialism only emerged and began to function after the victory of socialism in our country; they also believe that the basic economic law of socialism cannot exist and cannot function during the transition period from capitalism to socialism.
    This view cannot be considered correct.
    As everyone knows, after the great October Socialist Revolution was completed under the leadership of the Communist Party, the working people of our country expropriated the factories, land, railways, and other major means of production from the bourgeoisie, and transformed them into social property, i.e., property of the whole people. On the basis of the public ownership of the major means of production, in the most important and decisive sector of the national economy – our industrial sector – from the first day of the existence of the Soviet regime, new, socialist relations of production were established, namely, relations of fraternal cooperation and mutual assistance among free workers who were liberated from exploitation.
    These economic conditions caused the basic economic law of modern capitalism – the law of ensuring maximum capitalist profit – to lose its effectiveness, because this law had lost its own foundation for existence – capitalist private ownership. And the purpose of socialist production, which is generated on the basis of public ownership, is to satisfy the constantly growing needs of the working people. With the change in the purpose of production, the means to achieve the purpose of production also change. This means is to continuously increase and improve socialist production on the basis of advanced technology. From this, it can be seen that the basic economic law of socialism emerged and began to function with the emergence of the socialist system in our country.
    However, the replacement of one mode of production by another, the transition from the old economic system to the new economic system, i.e., the transition from capitalism to socialism, cannot be regarded as a fleeting period, nor can it be regarded as a temporary movement. In our country, this transition took almost twenty years. This period was a period of fierce and intense struggle between socialism, which was developing, growing, and consolidating under the leadership of the Communist party, and capitalism, which had been overthrown but not finally defeated and was therefore still resisting violently. Naturally, under these conditions, during this period, the basic economic law of socialism could not yet obtain a broad place for its operation. While the socialist economic structure, which played a leading role, existed, there also existed small commodity economic structures and capitalist economic structures. Not only that, but at that time there was also economic and technological backwardness in the country. All of this limited the scope of the operation of the basic economic law of socialism during the transition period from capitalism to socialism.
    However, this cannot be arbitrarily asserted, for example, that the basic economic law of socialism, which directly operates within the scope of the socialist structure, cannot touch small commodity production in any way. It should be known that the products of small commodity production, i.e., small-scale peasant economy, are always exchanged with the products of socialist industry on an increasingly large scale. And this means that the basic economic law of socialism, which directly operates within the scope of the socialist structure, also indirectly plays a role in small commodity production.
    With the consolidation of the socialist position and the strengthening of the role of socialist factors in all sectors of the national economy, the scope of the operation of the basic economic law of socialism has expanded day by day.
    The industrialization of the country and the collectivization of agriculture are of decisive significance for the destiny of socialism, for the destiny of our motherland, and for the consolidation of our Soviet economic system. After the industrialization of the country and the collectivization of agriculture were realized, the Communist Party guaranteed the unreserved rule of the socialist economic system in both urban and rural areas, and thus guaranteed the victory of socialism. And this means that the basic economic law of socialism has obtained a broad place for its operation.
    Where is the Role of the Basic Economic Law of Socialism Reflected?
    In our socialist society, the development of production is realized in a planned way by relying on the conscious and creative labor of the masses of the people under the leadership of the Communist Party.
    But this, in any case, cannot be said that the Soviet people and the Soviet leadership organs can disregard the laws of economic development and the laws of economic life, can disregard objective possibilities, economic laws, especially the basic economic law of socialism, and arbitrarily stipulate certain purposes and tasks for themselves and compile certain plans.
    The basic economic law of socialism first determines the purpose of socialist production, namely, to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society. At the same time, the basic economic law of socialism also determines the means to achieve the purpose of socialist production: to continuously increase and improve production on the basis of advanced technology.
    The purpose of socialist production and the means to achieve it are not the result of arbitrary choices. They are all constrained by objective economic conditions and the nature of the socialist mode of production.
    The objective nature of the basic economic law of socialism lies here. However, the objective nature of the basic economic law, like the objective nature of other economic laws of socialism, cannot function on its own without being affected by society and people to some extent.
    The spontaneous destructive effect of economic laws is a characteristic of the modern capitalist system, because the foundation of this system is the private ownership of the means of production. Under the socialist system, however, the public ownership of the means of production ensures the public nature of the production process, and society and people have been freed from the situation of being subject to spontaneous laws, so that they are not only able to recognize these laws, but also able to consciously apply and utilize these laws for the welfare of society.
    After recognizing the basic economic law of socialism and studying its requirements, the Communist Party and the Soviet government rely on it and take it into account in their practical activities, thus creating economic conditions that ensure that this basic law can increasingly obtain a broad place for its operation. In organizing the continuous growth and improvement of socialist production on the basis of advanced technology, the Communist Party and the Soviet government are increasingly fully satisfying the material and cultural needs of the Soviet people.
    Below are some materials showing the growth of industrial products, as well as means of production and consumer goods, in our country from 1948 to 1951 (with 1940 as 100):

Item  1948  1949  1950  1951
Growth of total industrial products 118 141 173 202
Growth of means of production 130 163 205 239
Growth of consumer goods 99 107 123 143

(Attached graph)

    Industrial products produced in 1952 increased approximately 2.3 times compared with 1940. The production of means of production increased approximately 2.7 times compared with 1940. At the same time, the production of consumer goods has also greatly increased.
    These materials illustrating the role of the basic economic law of socialism convincingly demonstrate that the characteristic of the socialist economic system is the continuous growth of industrial production. In particular, the industrial sector that produces means of production is developing especially rapidly, which ensures the smooth expansion of socialist reproduction and ensures that all sectors of the national economy can obtain modern technical equipment. The socialist country is different from capitalist countries: in capitalist countries, there are periodic pauses in technological development, as well as the destruction of social productive forces accompanied by economic crises; in our socialist society, economic crises have been eliminated, and there is continuous technological progress and continuous improvement of production on the basis of advanced technology.
    The materials cited above also prove that, along with the continuous growth of all industrial products in the Soviet Union, the production of consumer goods is also consistently rising. And this is entirely inevitable. Because in our socialist society, the purpose of production is to satisfy people and their needs. In order to maximize the satisfaction of the constantly growing needs of the working people, the Communist Party and the Soviet government have taken all measures to further expand the production of daily necessities, expand commodity circulation, and expand and improve the Soviet trade cause.
    The results of the good functioning of the basic economic law of socialism are clearly manifested in the continuous growth of national income in the Soviet Union, the prosperity of socialist culture, the improvement of housing and living conditions of the working people, and the development of education and health care. The Communist Party consciously utilizes the basic economic law of socialism, which creates the material and spiritual prerequisites for the cause of gradually transitioning from socialism to communism.
    The requirements of the basic economic law of socialism are also reflected in the instructions of the 19th Party Congress on the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the Soviet Union. These instructions stipulate that, in five years, the level of industrial production will increase by approximately 70 percent compared with 1950. At the same time, the production of means of production will increase by approximately 80 percent, and the production of consumer goods will reach approximately 65 percent. The Party also wants to greatly increase the production of agricultural products, which is also one of the important conditions for creating abundant products in our country.
    From this, it can be seen that the basic economic law of socialism determines the essence of socialist production, its main direction, and the main development process of the socialist economic system. And all the special economic laws of socialist production and the entire process of expanded reproduction under the socialist system must be subject to the role of the basic economic law of socialism. The basic economic law of socialism determines the progress of our society towards communism.
    Our Party relies on the understanding of the objective laws of social and economic development, the understanding of the laws of socialist production, and thus determines the various tasks of communist construction and the practical activities of leading the national economy.
    The Soviet people are implementing the Party's policy and the various historical resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and are achieving new and more brilliant victories in the development of socialist economy and culture.

    关于社会主义基本经济法则的作用
    苏联  伊·西哲利尼柯夫
    红星报读者包玛兹金、密席梁柯夫、库尼波夫、西基柯夫等同志来信，要求解释有关社会主义基本经济法则的作用问题。
    为要正确地解释社会主义基本经济法则的产生及其作用这一问题，就必须从马克思列宁主义科学关于社会发展法则和政治经济学法则的原理出发。
    马克思列宁主义教导说：经济法则的产生及其发生作用的基础是社会的经济条件和经济生活，它始终是处在不断的发展、运动和变化之中。如果一定的经济条件变化和消失了，那么，由该经济条件所产生的经济法则也就随之消失和失去效力，新的经济法则便在新的经济条件的基础上产生出来并发生作用。
    社会主义基本经济法则是自何时起发生作用的
    有些同志断定说，社会主义基本经济法则只是当社会主义在我国胜利之后才产生出来并发生作用的；他们并且还认为，在由资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期内，社会主义基本经济法则是不能存在和不能发生作用的。
    这种说法不能认为是正确的。
    大家都知道，在共产党的领导下完成了伟大的十月社会主义革命以后，我国劳动人民剥夺了资产阶级的工厂、土地、铁路等主要生产资料，并把它们转变为社会财产即全民财产。在主要生产资料公有化的基础上，在作为国民经济最主要最有决定意义的部门—我国工业部门内，从苏维埃政权存在的第一天起，就奠定了新的、社会主义的生产关系，即友爱合作的关系和摆脱了剥削的自由工作者相互帮助的关系。
    这些经济条件，使现代资本主义基本经济法则—保证最大限度资本主义利润的法则—失去了效力，因为这法则已失去了自身存在的基础—资本主义私有制。而在公有财产制基础上产生的社会主义生产的目的，便是满足劳动人民经常增长的需要。随着生产目的的改变，也就改变了实现生产目的的办法。这个办法就是在高度技术基础上，使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善。由此可见，社会主义基本经济法则是随着社会主义制度在我国的产生而产生出来并发生作用的。
    但是，一种生产方式为另一种生产方式所更替，旧的经济制度向新的经济制度过渡，即由资本主义向社会主义的过渡，不能看作是一个转瞬即逝的时期，也不能看成是一时的举动。在我国，这一过渡几乎占了二十年左右的时间。这一时期曾是发展、增长和巩固着的社会主义与那已被推翻但未被最终击溃因而仍在狂暴反抗的资本主义进行残酷剧烈斗争的时期。自然，在这种条件之下，在这种时期内，社会主义基本经济法则还未能得到它发生作用的广阔场所。与起着主导作用的社会主义经济结构存在的同时，还存在着小商品经济结构和资本主义经济结构，不仅如此，当时在国内还存在着经济技术上的落后状态，所有这一切就使社会主义基本经济法则在由资本主义转变为社会主义的过渡时期中的发生作用的范围受到限制。
    然而由此并不能妄自断言，例如说在社会主义结构范围内直接发生作用的社会主义基本经济法则，无论如何也不能触及到小商品生产。要知道小商品生产即小农经济的产品总是规模愈来愈大地和社会主义工业的产品进行交换。而这就是说，直接在社会主义结构范围内发生作用的社会主义基本经济法则也间接地对小商品生产起着作用。
    随着社会主义阵地的稳固以及社会主义因素在一切国民经济部门内作用的加强，社会主义基本经济法则的发生作用范围就日益扩大了。
    国家的工业化和农业集体化对于社会主义的命运，对于我们祖国的命运，对于巩固我国苏维埃经济制度具有决定的意义。在实现了国家的工业化和农业集体化以后，共产党保证了社会主义经济体系在城市和乡村都一无例外的统治，也就保证了社会主义的胜利。而这也就是说，社会主义基本经济法则已经获得了广阔的发生作用场所。
    社会主义基本经济法则的作用表现在那里
    在我们社会主义社会里，生产的发展，是依靠在共产党领导下的人民群众自觉的和创造性的劳动有计划地实现的。
    但这无论如何也不能说，苏联人民和苏联的领导机关便可不必估计经济发展的规律和经济生活的规律，便可不必估计客观的可能性、经济法则尤其是社会主义基本经济法则而任意为自己规定某种目的和任务和编制某种计划了。
    社会主义基本经济法则首先决定了社会主义生产的目的，即保证最大限度地满足整个社会不断增长的物质与文化需要。与此同时，社会主义基本经济法则又决定了达到社会主义生产目的的手段：在高度技术基础上使生产不断增长和不断完善。
    社会主义生产的目的及其实现的办法都不是什么随意选择的结果。它们都是由客观的经济条件和社会主义生产方式的性质所制约的。
    社会主义基本经济法则的客观性质就在这里。但是基本经济法则的客观性质，正如社会主义其他经济法则的客观性质一样，不是不受社会和人对它所起的某种影响，便可自行发生作用。
    经济法则的自发破坏作用是现代资本主义制度的特质，因为这一制度的基础是生产资料私有制。而在社会主义制度下，生产资料公有制确保了生产过程的公有性质，社会和人都已摆脱了服从自发法则的状况，因而便不仅能够认识这些法则，而且能够自觉地运用和利用这些法则为社会谋求福利。
    认识了社会主义基本经济法则和研究了它的要求之后，共产党和苏联政府便依靠着它并在自己的实际活动中估计到它，因而造成了保障这一基本法则能够日益获得发生作用的广阔场所的经济条件。在以高度技术为基础组织社会主义生产的不断增长和完善时，共产党和苏联政府日益充分地满足着苏联人民的物质和文化需要。
    下面举出一些表明我国工业产品以及生产资料和消费品在一九四八到一九五一年内增长情况的材料（以一九四○年为一○○）：项目  一九四八年  一九四九年  一九五○年  一九五一年全部工业产品的增长  一一八  一四一  一七三  二○二生产资料的增长 一三○  一六三  二○五  二三九消费品的增长  九九  一○七  一二三  一四三（附图表）
    一九五二年生产的工业产品与一九四○年相比较，大约增加二点三倍。而生产资料的生产与一九四○年相比较，约增加到二点七倍。同时，消费品的生产也已大大增长了。
    这些说明社会主义基本经济法则作用的材料，令人信服地证明了社会主义经济制度的特征，就是工业生产不断的增长。尤其是生产生产资料的工业部门发展得特别迅速，这就保证了顺利地扩大社会主义再生产，保证了国民经济的一切部门都能获得新式的技术装备。社会主义国家与资本主义各国不同：在资本主义国家里有技术发展中的周期停顿，以及由于经济危机而伴随着的社会生产力破坏的现象；在我们社会主义社会里已经摆脱了经济危机，有的是不断的技术进步，在高度技术基础上生产的不断完善。
    上面所举的材料也证明了，与苏联全部工业产品不断增长的同时，消费品的生产也是一贯地向上高涨。而这也完全是必然的现象。因为在我们社会主义社会中，生产的目的是为了满足人及其需要。为了最大限度地满足劳动人民不断增长的需要，共产党和苏联政府采取了一切措施来进一步扩大日用品的生产，扩大商品流通，扩大并改善苏维埃贸易事业。
    社会主义基本经济法则发生良好作用的结果，明显地表现在苏联国民收入不断增长，社会主义文化的繁荣，劳动人民住宅和生活条件的改善以及教育事业和保健事业的发展等方面。共产党自觉地利用着社会主义基本经济法则，它为逐步地由社会主义过渡到共产主义的事业创造着物质和精神的前提。
    社会主义基本经济法则的要求也在第十九次党代表大会关于发展苏联的第五个五年计划的指示中得到了反映。这些指示预定，在五年间，工业生产的水平与一九五○年相比较，约增加百分之七十。同时，生产资料的生产将增加百分之八十左右，而消费品的生产将达到百分之六十五左右。党还要农产品大大地增产，而这也是造成我国获得丰富产品的重要条件之一。
    由此可见，社会主义基本经济法则决定了社会主义生产的实质，它的主要方向以及社会主义经济制度的主要发展过程。而社会主义生产一切特殊的经济法则以及社会主义制度下扩大再生产的整个过程都要服从于社会主义基本经济法则的作用。社会主义基本经济法则决定着我国社会过渡到共产主义的进展。
    我们的党倚靠着对社会经济发展的客观法则的了解，对于社会主义生产法则的了解，因而就决定了共产主义建设的各项任务以及领导国民经济的实际活动。
    苏联人民正在实现着党的政策和苏联共产党十九次代表大会的各项历史性的决议，正在社会主义经济与文化发展中获得更新的和更光辉的胜利。
