    Harvest
    ——A Visit to the Garzê Farm
    Zhou Langsheng
    The troops entering Tibet, with their unparalleled heroic fighting spirit, endured and overcame the harsh cold and logistical difficulties, selflessly battling against nature. In addition to rapidly constructing the Kangzang Highway to the Nujiang River basin, they also reclaimed tens of thousands of acres of virgin land beneath the majestic snow-capped mountains and on the vast grasslands, establishing numerous farms. The Garzê Farm is one of them.
    In September, the Kangzang Plateau enjoys a pleasant climate. Golden waves of highland barley ripple in the breeze, and the Tibetan people sing songs of harvest as they labor diligently and joyfully on their land. One morning, as the golden sunlight began to peek over the snow-capped peaks, I and other comrades were invited to visit the Garzê Farm.
    The Garzê Farm is located on the "river bend" plain of the Yalong River, with fertile land and convenient irrigation, covering a total area of more than 1,700 acres. The person in charge of the farm introduced to us: "As early as 1951, the troops entering Tibet chose this fertile land to establish a large-scale farm, tasked with cultivating agricultural talent for the plateau, selecting superior varieties, and promoting production experience." He said, "In the past two years, our abundant harvests have not only improved the lives of the troops stationed in Garzê but, more importantly, have opened up a brand new path for Tibetan compatriots in developing agricultural production; helping them break away from and improve their primitive and backward production methods and tools."
    The farm's periphery is a hundred-meter-wide field of peas, with mature pea vines drooping and reclining around the farm. Although the pea seeds came from the Chengdu Plain, they also thrived on the plateau: one pea seedling can produce more than forty pairs of pods, and each pod can grow eighteen large peas. As we walked into the pea field, the mature pods rustled under our feet. The labor force was happily harvesting their fruits of labor; comrades from the transportation team, humming cheerful tunes, drove livestock, transporting the peas to the drying ground, cart after cart.
    Just as we crossed the pea field, two vehicles suddenly sped over from the western end of the farm. It turned out that the Garzê County People's Government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region had organized Tibetan compatriots to visit, dressed in brightly colored clothing and dazzling jewelry, and brought "Hadas" as gifts to the farm comrades for their harvest. We merged with them to form a visiting team, and under the guidance of the farm leader, we entered the high-yield area together.
    First displayed in front of us was an undulating "sea of wheat" covering more than 400 acres. The golden wheat ears rose and fell in the breeze, as if bowing to the visitors. The tallest stalks, longest ears, and most eye-catching variety was the Soviet Volga winter wheat. After experiments by the comrades of the farm's variety research class last winter, this wheat can be harvested twice a year on the Kangzang Plateau. Tibetan compatriot Los Mei Tong, seeing the 1.7-meter-high wheat stalks and 30-centimeter-long ears, said to the farm leader: "The Soviet wheat you grow is like a yak's tail, and our highland barley is like a rat's tail. Give me a few ears of wheat for seeds." The farm comrades immediately helped him select more than a dozen ears with long and dense grains. The most robust plot in the middle of the wheat field was the Northern Mingjian winter wheat variety. Although it was only sown this year, its yield was no less than that of the inland areas. The local highland barley after seed selection has fully extended awns and plump grains, yielding an average of 200 jin of clean wheat per mu, exceeding the harvest of local Tibetans by five times. Other wheat varieties from various regions planted by the farm have matured, and more than 200 acres have already been harvested, with a huge mountain of wheat piled up on the drying ground.
    Crossing an irrigation ditch more than three feet wide, we reached the vegetable garden in the high-yield area. Yellow rapeseed flowers and white radish flowers were still in full bloom, with wild bees buzzing busily in the stamens. The person in charge of the farm pointed to the lush green vegetable garden and said to us: "This year, we have planted a total of 28 kinds of vegetables, including cabbage, amaranth, turnip, radish, potato, rapeseed, Chinese cabbage, lettuce, spinach, broad bean, yellow Chinese cabbage, green onion, and garlic sprouts. The supply of vegetables has already exceeded the demand for the troops stationed in Garzê, so we can also supply the needs of Tibetan compatriots and the market in large quantities." Cabbages have already started to form into spheres, with the largest weighing up to 20 jin each. Chinese cabbage and seedless spinach grown from Beijing seeds are the two most delightful vegetables. Due to the acidic sandy soil of the plateau, their branches and leaves are thick and large. Each Chinese cabbage can weigh 6 jin; spinach does not easily set seed, with leaves 20 centimeters long and stems more than 30 centimeters high. These two vegetables have already been harvested for one season, and now the seedlings are growing lush and lovely again in the vegetable garden. Fist-sized garlic has just been harvested. We curiously weighed one head, and each head weighed more than 6 liang net. Potatoes are still blooming with milky white flowers. The thick stalks cover the earth, symbolizing the autumn harvest. At the end of the vegetable garden is the radish field. The farm comrades are adding soil to avoid dryness and hollowness. At this time, the Tibetan woman Zha Ma took a radish given to her by the farm comrade, pulled out the saber from her waist, and said with emotion while peeling it: "I am personally eating a radish as big as a pig today. I never dreamed that it would grow on our plateau. In the past, people said that the plateau land was not fertile and the climate was not good, so vegetables could not be grown. The fate of the Tibetan people was destined to eat raw beef and bloody mutton, but today, seeing the vegetables grown on the farm with my own eyes, no one will believe that kind of statement. After I return to Tuoba, I will definitely tell my Tibetan compatriots to learn advanced production experience and methods from the People's Liberation Army, and grow big radishes on their own land as well."
    Finally, we also visited the variety cultivation area. Although the scope of the variety area is only 30 mu wide, it has selected more than 170 kinds of crop varieties from home and abroad that are suitable for cold and plateau climates for cultivation. Comrade Lei Yiqing of the Farm Variety Research Class pointed to various successfully cultivated varieties and introduced to us: "In addition to 38 kinds of Soviet Volga winter wheat, Beijing Chinese cabbage, seedless spinach, and general vegetables from the mainland, the successfully cultivated and harvested varieties also include the Soviet 'Xinlimei' (radish), which has a sweet taste and high moisture content; Northeast broad beans, which can grow 24 pairs of pods after topping, and can mature early, immune to severe cold attacks; Other varieties such as Korean Tangshan Red, Shijiazhuang cabbage, and Sichuan pumpkin can all be harvested on the Kangzang Plateau. Soviet purple alfalfa is also very suitable for growing on the plateau, as it can be used as feed for livestock and solves the difficulty of 'eight years of wasteland after one year of harvest' due to lack of fertilizer in the plateau. Finally, Comrade Lei Yiqing said: "Judging from the successfully cultivated varieties and this year's abundant harvest, we believe that the agriculture and animal husbandry of the Kangzang Plateau have a future."

    丰收
    ——参观甘孜农场
    周浪声
    进藏部队以无比英勇的战斗毅力，忍受和克服了天寒地冻及物资补给的困难，忘我地和大自然搏斗，除了把康藏公路已迅速地修筑到怒江流域外，并在雄伟的雪山底下，辽阔的草原上，开垦了成千成万亩的处女地，建立了许多农场。甘孜农场就是其中的一个。
    九月的康藏高原，气候宜人，金黄色的青稞麦浪，随着微风荡漾，藏族人民都唱着丰收之歌，辛勤愉快地在自己的土地上劳动着。一天早晨，金色的太阳光芒，刚透射在雪山顶上的时候，我和其他同志，被邀请到甘孜农场去参观。
    甘孜农场在雅砻江的“河套”平原上，土地肥沃，灌溉便利，面积共有一千七百多亩。农场负责同志给我们介绍说：“进藏部队远在一九五一年，就选择在这块肥美的土地上，开辟一个规模宏大的、负有培养高原农业人材、选择优良品种和推广生产经验使命的农场。”他说：“两年来，我们丰收的农作物，不但改善和提高了驻甘孜部队的生活，而更重要的是给藏族同胞在发展农业生产上开辟出一条崭新的道路；帮助他们摆脱和改进了原始落后的生产方式和生产工具。”
    农场的外围是一片一百公尺宽的豌豆地，成熟下坠的豌豆藤斜卧在农场四周。豌豆种籽虽然来自成都平原，但它在高原同样得到丰收：一根豌豆苗可以生四十多对豆荚，而每荚又可长十八颗大豌豆。当我们走进豌豆地时，成熟的豆荚被脚碰得啷啷作响。劳动大军正在这里愉快地收割着自己的劳动成果；运输队的同志，嘴里哼着轻快的小调，赶着牲口，一车车地把豌豆运到晒场上去。
    我们刚越过豌豆地时，农场的西尽头突然驰过来两辆汽车。原来这是藏族自治区甘孜县人民政府组织了藏胞来参观的，他们穿戴着艳色服装和眩目的首饰，而且带了“哈达”作为对农场同志们丰收的献礼。我们和他们汇合成一支参观的队伍，在农场负责同志的引导下，一块儿进入了丰产区。
    首先展示在面前的是一片四百多亩起伏不平的
    “麦海”，金黄色的麦穗，在微风里一起一伏，好像对参观者鞠躬。麦秆最高，穗子最长和最惹人注意的要算苏联的伏尔加冬性小麦。去冬经农场品种研究班的同志试验，这种麦子在康藏高原一年可以收种两次。藏胞罗斯美通，看到一公尺七高的麦秆和三十公分长的麦穗，就向农场负责同志说：“你们种的苏联麦像牦牛尾巴似的，我们的青稞麦像老鼠尾巴似的，给我几个麦穗做种籽吧。”农场同志立刻帮助他挑选了十几个穗子既长、颗粒又稠的品种。麦地中间长得最壮实的一片，是北方铭鉴冬小麦品种，虽然是今年刚开始播种，但产量同样不亚于内地。经过选种后的本地青稞麦，麦芒四展，颗粒丰满，每亩地平均可收净麦二百斤，超过当地藏胞收成的五倍。农场所种其他各地区和各品种的麦子，都已成熟，现在已收割了二百多亩，晒场上已堆起了一座庞大的麦山。
    越过一条三尺多宽的灌溉渠，就是丰产区的蔬菜地。黄色的油菜花和白色的萝卜花还盛开着，野蜜蜂嗡嗡地在花蕊里忙碌地钻进钻出。农场负责同志指着绿油油的菜圃对我们说：“今年我们共种有莲花白菜、苋菜、芜菁、萝卜、马铃薯、油菜、小白菜、莴苣、菠菜、葫豆、黄秧白、大葱、蒜苗等二十八种蔬菜。蔬菜对驻甘孜部队来说，已经供过于求，所以，我们还可以大量供应藏胞和市面上的需要。”莲花白菜已经开始包成球形，最大的每颗可有二十斤。北京的种籽生长起来的小白菜和无籽菠菜，是最逗人喜爱的两种菜蔬。由于高原多酸性砂质土壤，所以它们生长起来，枝叶淳厚而硕大，小白菜每棵可有六斤；菠菜不易结籽，叶长二十公分，茎高三十余公分。这两种菜已经收了一季，现在菜苗又青葱可爱地长满了菜圃。拳头般大的大蒜刚收好，我们好奇地用秤称了一下，每个蒜头净重有六两多。马铃薯还开着乳白色的花，粗壮的枝秆，盖蔽了大地，象征着秋后的丰收。蔬菜圃的尽头是萝卜地，农场的同志为了避免干燥空心，正在加土。这时，女藏胞札玛拿着农场同志给她的一个萝卜，拔出腰中的佩刀，一边削皮，一边感动地说：“像小猪一样的萝卜我今天亲口吃上了，过去连做梦也不会想到咱们高原的土地上会长出它来。以前人们都说，高原土地不肥，气候不好，不能种蔬菜，藏族人民的命注定就该吃生牛肉和带血的羊肉，可是，我今天亲眼看到农场种植的蔬菜，谁也不会相信他们那种说法。我回到妥坝后，一定叫藏族同胞好好地向解放军学习先进的生产经验和生产方法，在自己的土地上也长起大萝卜来。”
    最后，我们还参观了品种培养区。品种区的范畴虽然只有三十亩地宽，但这里选择了国内外的、适合寒带和高原气候的、一百七十多种农作物的品种在培养。农场品种研究班的雷益清同志，指着各种培养成功的品种给我们介绍说：“已经培养成功而得到丰收的，除了苏联伏尔加冬麦，北京小白菜、无籽菠菜和内地的一般蔬菜等三十八种外，还有苏联的“心里美”（萝卜），这种萝卜，滋味甘美，含水分多；东北的葫豆，剪头后可长二十四对豆荚，而且可以早熟，不受严寒的袭击；其它如朝鲜的唐山红，石家庄的白菜，四川的南瓜等，在康藏高原都可得到丰收。苏联的紫花苜蓿，也很适合在高原生长，它既能作为牲口的饲料，又解决了“一年收后八年荒”的高原有地没有肥料的困难。最后雷益清同志说：“从培养成功的品种上和今年丰收的成果上看，我们相信康藏高原的农牧业是有前途的。”
