    Seamless Steel Pipe Manufacturing Successfully
    By our reporters Zhu Bo and Chang Gong

    The day people had been eagerly and anxiously awaiting has finally arrived: the hot test rolling at the Angang Seamless Steel Pipe Plant has been successful!

    October 27th was the most tense day for all the workers at the Seamless Steel Pipe Plant. They inspected the machines again and again. Then, the male and female workers and Soviet experts responsible for the hot test rolling entered their positions, waiting for the order to begin the hot test rolling.

    At 2:30 PM, Yang Fangren, the director of the Seamless Steel Pipe Plant, issued the order to begin the hot test rolling. The whistle sounded, and all the machines in the plant started running. Wang Suzhen, a seventeen-year-old female worker on the No. 2 operating platform of the heating furnace, gently moved the No. 41 operating lever, and the blowing machine immediately blew the red-hot tube billet out of the heating furnace. The tube billet continued to roll automatically onto the turning machine. Wang Suzhen then moved the No. 43 and No. 45 operating levers, and the turning machine, like a few giant hands, gently sent the tube billet onto the conveyor track. Then, amidst the applause of the people in the plant, the tube billet climbed onto the piercing machine.

    The workers on the No. 3 operating platform of the piercing machine, seeing the signal light indicating that the piercing preparation work was complete, pressed the button to open and close the guide steel device to hold the tube billet; the blowing machine forcefully pushed the tube billet towards the rolls of the piercing machine, and as soon as the tube billet touched the mandrel, it flew quickly through the rolls with sparks. When it came out, it had become a steel pipe. The tube billet only spent seventeen seconds going through the piercing machine.

    Everyone present cheered in unison: Success! The Soviet experts smiled, the workers responsible for the operation smiled, and everyone smiled.

    The steel pipe continued to roll forward, passing through the tube rolling mill, the sizing mill, the reducing mill..., and undergoing layer upon layer of inspection. Every place it arrived at aroused cheers from the nearby crowd.

    On the inspection result statistical table of the technical supervision office's inspection station stationed at the Seamless Steel Pipe Plant, the inspectors filled in the inspection results of the first, and also the very first, steel pipe. The inspectors said excitedly: "Completely conforms to the original specified specifications."

    People seeing the production speed and automated and mechanized equipment of the new China's Seamless Steel Pipe Plant cannot help but think of the old Seamless Steel Pipe Plant during the puppet Manchurian regime. According to the old workers, "One is a clumsy ox, the other is a thoroughbred horse." The factory at that time was simply like hell, almost everything depended on heavy manual labor, and several workers were injured every day. Now, the workers steadily sit at the operating platform and manufacture steel pipes. Lan Zhenqi, an old worker who works at the heating furnace, used to be a furnace stoker at the old Seamless Steel Pipe Plant during the puppet Manchurian regime. He used to add coal to the heating furnace for more than ten hours a day; if he was a little slow, he would be brutally beaten by the Japanese. Now, standing beside the heating furnace, he said: "Now the important thing is not running around, but using your brain well. As long as you don't mess up those buttons, you can manufacture steel pipes." He also told the visitors about the equipment of the heating furnace in the old Seamless Steel Pipe Plant. At that time, the heating furnace had no automatic equipment at all, and even removing the tube billet was done by people using steel hooks to pull it out. He pointed to the female worker on the operating platform and said: "It wasn't as easy as it is for her; she moves her hand and the tube billet comes out!"

    Li Encui, a forty-year-old pipe cutter, has been smiling ever since he saw the first steel pipe come out. He pointed to the young workers and said: "Young lads are so lucky, work hard!" Li Encui used to wear out a pair of gloves in three days and tear a set of clothes in four or five days when he was a pipe cutter; because at that time, all parts of the pipe cutting machine were not automatic, the roller track was fixed, the steel pipe had to be pushed by people, there was no lifting platform and blowing machine, and people had to lift the steel pipe and push it into the pipe cutting machine, and then people had to move the cutting knife over. Now, as long as you follow the operating procedures and press the button, the problem is solved.

    However, when people see the success of the hot test rolling, they also think that this victory did not come easily. Everyone here thinks of the Soviet government sending the best experts to help us and providing us with the latest equipment. Look at those Soviet experts who helped build the Seamless Steel Pipe Plant! They and the capital construction workers building the Seamless Steel Pipe Plant installed thousands of tons of machines. Among them were large machines weighing hundreds of tons, and also small parts weighing only a few ounces. They accurately installed these tens of thousands of large and small parts into a whole. The workers who mastered the production also encountered many difficulties when learning modern industrial production technology, but these difficulties were overcome by these people who were dedicated to building the country's heavy industry, with the support and encouragement of the people of the whole country.

    无缝钢管制造成功了
    本报记者  朱波、常工
    人们兴奋、紧张地盼望着的一天终于到来了，鞍钢无缝钢管厂热试轧已经成功了。
    十月二十七日是无缝钢管厂全体职工最为紧张的一天，他们一次一次地对机器进行了检查。接着，负责热试轧的男女工人和苏联专家进入自己的岗位，等候着进行热试轧的命令。
    下午二时半，无缝钢管厂杨仿人厂长下达了开始热试轧的命令，汽笛响了，全厂的机器转动了。加热炉二号操作台上的十七岁的女工王素珍轻轻地把四十一号操作把一搬，吹料机立刻把红色的管坯从加热炉里吹出来。管坯继续自动滚到翻料机上。王素珍接着搬动了四十三、四十五号操作把，翻料机就像几只巨大的手一样，把管坯轻轻地送往输送轨道上，然后，管坯在全厂人们的掌声中，爬上了穿孔机。
    穿孔机三号操作台上的工人，看到标志穿孔准备工作已经完备的信号灯亮了，就揿动电钮，开闭导钢装置，把管坯扣住；吹料机有力地把管坯向着穿孔机的轧辊推去，管坯一接触顶心杆，就飞快地带着火花，从轧辊穿过去了。它出来时就变成了一根钢管。管坯经过穿孔机只要十七秒钟的时间。
    在场的人都不约而同地发出欢呼：成功了！苏联专家们笑了，负责操作的工人们笑了，所有的人都笑了。
    钢管继续向前滚去，经过了轧管机、均径机、定径机……，经过了层层的检查。它每到一处就引起附近人群的欢呼。
    在技术监督处驻无缝钢管厂检查站的检查结果统计表上，检查人员填写了第一次也是第一根钢管的检查结果。检查人员兴奋地说：“完全合乎原规定的规格。”
    人们看到新中国无缝钢管厂的生产速度和自动化机械化的设备，不免想起伪满时期的旧的无缝钢管厂。按老工人的说法：“一个是笨牛，一个是千里马。”那时的工厂简直和地狱一样，全厂差不多都靠繁重的体力劳动，那一天也要伤几个工人。现在呢，工人稳稳地坐在操作台上就把钢管制造出来了。在加热炉工作的老工人蓝振歧，过去是伪满时期旧无缝钢管厂的烧炉工人，每天一连十几个钟头向加热炉里添煤；稍微慢一点就遭到日本人的毒打。如今他站在加热炉旁说：“现在重要的不是跑腿，而是好好地用脑筋，只要把那些电钮搞不错，就能制造出钢管来。”他还向参观的人讲述旧无缝钢管厂加热炉的设备，那时候的加热炉甚么自动设备都没有，就是出管坯也是用人拿钢钩向外扒。他指了指操作台上的女工说：“那会像她那么轻松，手一动管坯就出来了！”
    四十多岁的切管工人李恩翠，从他看见第一根钢管出来的时候起，就一直笑得合不住嘴。他指着青年工人说：“小伙子多幸运啊，好好地干吧！”李恩翠过去当切管工人时，三天就用一付手套，四五天就磨破一套衣服；因为那时切管机的各个部分都不是自动的，辊道是死的，钢管来了要用人推，没有升降台和吹料机，要用人把钢管抬起来推进切管机，然后再由人把切刀搬过来。现在只要按照操作程序按电钮，问题就解决了。
    但是，人们看到热试轧成功的时候，也想到这个胜利不是容易得来的。在这里的人谁都会想到苏联政府派来最优秀的专家帮助我们，把最新型的设备供给我们。看一看那些帮助建设无缝钢管厂的苏联专家吧！他们和建筑无缝钢管厂的基本建设工人们在一起，把成千吨的机器安装起来。其中有数百吨重的大机器，也有小到几两重的小部件。他们准确地把这些成千成万的大大小小的机件安装成了一个整体。掌握生产的工人们在学习近代化工业生产技术时也遇到了许多困难，但这些困难都在全国人民的支援和鼓舞下，被这些为决心建设祖国重工业而献身的人们所战胜了。
