    Increasing Grain Harvests in Areas Where Early Rice Has Already Been Harvested
    Xu Shufang of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Zhenze County Committee in Jiangsu Province writes: Our county has many lakeside "dangtian" fields, all planted with early rice. In order to increase grain harvests, in addition to mobilizing farmers to do a good job in the autumn harvest, paying attention to preventing the loss of late rice grains, and planting more vegetables, our county has come up with two methods to increase grain income in the "dangtian" areas where early rice has already been harvested:

    First, thresh the rice a second time. When harvesting "dangtian" rice, it is the most intense time for drought resistance, and most people are careless when threshing the rice, leaving many rice ears on the already threshed rice straw. According to experiments conducted by the county party committee's work group in a mutual aid team in Ducun Township, if the already threshed rice is threshed again, one mu can yield an additional ten to twenty-five jin. If all the "dangtian" fields in the county are threshed a second time, calculating an additional ten jin of grain per mu, more than 540,000 jin of grain could be harvested. Therefore, our county has made this method a key experiment and will promote it universally.

    Second, protect regenerated rice (rice ears that grow again from the roots after the early rice is harvested). In the past, farmers in our county consistently fed regenerated rice to cattle and ducks, or plowed it under as green manure; no one ever thought of letting it grow and harvesting it a second time. According to my understanding in Muli Township, the early rice in the township's 1,600 mu of "dangtian" fields is generally harvested between the fifth day and the middle of the seventh lunar month, and the regenerated rice can be harvested again after a month and a half. Each regenerated rice ear has forty to eighty grains of rice. If protected well, fifty jin can be harvested per mu. This year, because the county people's government mobilized farmers to protect regenerated rice relatively late, and the masses had no habit of protecting regenerated rice, only a small portion was retained. In the Sanjiaojian Dike area, one-third of the 419 mu of fields retained regenerated rice, which is now mature, just like the first crop, appearing golden yellow, and is estimated to yield more than 7,500 jin. Many people regret wasting regenerated rice in the past and are determined to protect regenerated rice well next year and strive to harvest more grain.

### 在早稻已经收割的地区还可以增加粮食收获量

    在早稻已经收割的地区还可以增加粮食收获量
    中共江苏震泽县委宣传部徐漱芳来信：我县靠湖的荡田很多，种的全是早稻。为了提高粮食收获量，目前我县除了动员农民作好秋收，注意防止晚稻谷粒的散失及多种蔬菜以外，还想出了在早稻已经收割的荡田地区增加粮食收入的两个办法：
    一，掼二遍稻。荡田稻在收割时正是抗旱最紧张的时候，大部分群众掼稻很马虎，已掼的稻草上还留下很多稻穗。据县委工作组在渡村乡一个互助组内试验，如把已掼的稻再掼一遍，一亩可以多收十斤到二十五斤。如果全县所有的荡田都掼二遍稻，每亩以多收十斤谷子计算，就可以多收五十四万斤以上的粮食。因此，我县已将这个办法作了重点试验，并将普遍推广。
    二，保护再生稻（在早稻收割后从根上重又生出来的稻穗）。我县农民过去一贯把再生稻喂牛、喂鸭，或犁掉作为绿肥；从来没有人想到让它成长后再收割一次。据我在穆里乡了解，全乡一千六百亩荡田的早稻，一般在农历七月初五到月中都已收割完毕，隔一个半月光景再生稻又可以收割了。每支再生稻穗有四十粒到八十粒稻谷，如果保护得好，每亩收五十斤是不成问题的。今年由于县人民政府动员农民保护再生稻的时间较迟，群众对保护再生稻又无习惯，因此只保留了一小部分。三角尖圩子里四百十九亩田中留下三分之一的再生稻，现在已经成熟，与头遍稻一样，望过去一片金黄，估计可以收七千五百多斤。很多群众对过去随便糟蹋再生稻都觉得可惜，决心在明年一定要好好保护再生稻，争取多收粮食。
