New Military Adventure of US-French Aggression Against Vietnam
Feng Zhidan

The US and French governments' negotiations on the United States increasing military "aid" to France for its war of aggression against Vietnam concluded on September 30th, and a joint communiqué was issued formally announcing that the United States, in addition to the $400 million in military "aid" previously allocated to France, would allocate an additional $385 million to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. This communiqué once again illustrates that, in order to maintain the tense situation in the Far East after the Korean armistice, the US aggressive forces are stepping up their pressure on the French Laniel government through "US aid," forcing France to continue fighting in the East for the interests of Wall Street; and the Laniel government is succumbing to US pressure, engaging in new military adventures in Vietnam under even stricter US control.

Recently, the Associated Press revealed that after the United States increases its military "aid" to France, it will "supervise to ensure that military aid is used effectively, otherwise this aid will be equivalent to sending it down a rat hole." This means that the United States will more directly and blatantly interfere in the Vietnam War.

The joint communiqué particularly emphasized that France guarantees to "resolutely implement" the declaration granting "independence" to the three puppet regimes in Indochina. This means that the US aggressive forces will further squeeze out France and control Indochina.

All the facts prove that, under the pressure of the dollar, the French government has chosen to brazenly disregard the legitimate desire of the French people to peacefully resolve international issues, and to continue its war of aggression in Vietnam. The French government has announced that it will dispatch nine battalions of Moroccan and Algerian soldiers stationed in Western Europe to the Vietnamese battlefield, and will expand a French battalion that fought in Korea into a regiment and send it to Vietnam. At the same time, it will step up the expansion of the Bao Dai puppet army by 54 battalions and投入 them into the war. According to the intentions of the American interventionists, in recent months, the French aggressor troops in Vietnam have begun a so-called "mopping-up war" against the People's Army in the plains of North Vietnam, and妄想 to "militarily destroy" the Vietnamese People's Army.

The French government's adventurous policy of taking US dollars to fight for the United States runs counter to the French people's desire to end the war of aggression against Vietnam, and is also contrary to the statements made by some figures in the French ruling class who expressed their desire for a peaceful resolution of the Vietnam War. French Prime Minister Laniel, in his speech on September 26, expressed his willingness to conduct "peace negotiations" to end the Indochina War. French Deputy Foreign Minister Schuman also stated at the United Nations General Assembly that negotiations to end the Indochina War should begin during or after the Korean Political Conference. However, according to a report by International News Service on September 30, because the French government took the increased military "aid" from the United States, it had to assume an obligation: France would have no right to conduct negotiations to end the war without the consent of the United States. Therefore, a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry had to explain Schuman's vague peace remarks at the United Nations, saying that Schuman's speech did not refer to "immediate negotiations," but that France now wants to "vigorously wage war." Of course, Laniel's peace rhetoric is worthless.

Thus, the US and French imperialists are vigorously touting the "Navarre Military Plan," which embodies the new US-French conspiracy to expand the Vietnam War. They even disregard the facts to promote the "victory" of the French army's "mopping up" operations against the rear bases of the People's Army in the Red River Delta region. However, these poor propagandists cannot change the fact that the French aggressor army and the Bao Dai puppet army suffered惨重的失败 in this "mopping up" operation.

After the French colonial army's failed surprise attack on Lang Son with 5,000 paratroopers on July 17, it successively launched large-scale "mopping up" wars around Hanoi and in the provinces of Jian'an, Xing'an, and 南定. In each battle, the Vietnamese People's Army repelled the French army's offensive, which was covered by a large number of warships, aircraft, and artillery, and殲滅 a large number of enemy troops. In the counter-"mopping up" battles in Hai Hau County from August 1 to 18, the People's Army殲滅ed 1,344 enemy troops, and wounded the commander and chief of staff of the French Third Division at the Du She French military stronghold; the People's Army also smashed the enemy's "mopping up" operation by 17 battalions in the area north of Lục Giang on the left bank of the Red River from September 23 to 25,殲滅ing more than 630 enemy and puppet troops. The guerrilla base area on the left bank of the Red River has been expanding day by day, posing a major threat to the enemy's rear. In recent months, the guerrilla war has been developing victoriously on the plains of North Vietnam. The People's Army has not only拔除 many French military strongholds, but has also launched attacks on major cities in the enemy-occupied areas, such as Hai Phong and the provincial capitals of 建安 and 南定, and has constantly intercepted the transportation lines of the French army and the Bao Dai puppet army. In Central and South Vietnam, the People's Army has also launched active guerrilla warfare.

Navarre's "mopping up" plan has repeatedly suffered 可耻的失败, and the entire Red River Delta is still densely populated with People's Army guerrilla warfare bases around the cities occupied by the French army, which further proves that the French colonial authorities and the Bao Dai traitorous group are increasingly unable to overcome the crisis of insufficient troops and the continuous殲滅 of their forces. Since the great victory in the Northwest, the People's Army has殲滅ed more than 20,000 enemies from January to September 15 this year; now France is making great efforts to gather some French troops and expand tens of thousands of puppet troops, but it is still unable to change the situation of lack of troops. According to the Washington Post on August 19, Navarre originally requested 20,000 troops to be transferred from France proper; however, Laniel decided to reduce this number after "looking at the scant military reserves left." Insufficient troops is one aspect; and low morale is another, especially among the newly formed and forcibly conscripted Bao Dai puppet troops. According to United Press reports, French officials had to admit the fact that puppet troops were surrendering and rebelling, and there was "widespread anxiety" about the "new local troops." The French colonists' forced conscription in the occupied areas has met with increasingly strong resistance. At the same time, the people of Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and other places are engaged in heroic struggles against colonial rule, and it will be even more difficult for the French colonists to use the manpower of these colonial countries as cannon fodder.

The French people are increasingly dissatisfied with the Laniel government's卑鄙 behavior of succumbing to the United States and continuing the Indochina War. The French "Humanité" accused Laniel of "making France a supplier of mercenaries," and pointed out: "Only by negotiating with the true representatives of the Indochinese people, and thereby reaching agreements on economic and cultural issues, that is, agreements based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, can France escape the dead end of huge expenditure and heavy casualties." "Liberation" wrote: "French public opinion is almost unanimously demanding peace, but the government is no longer free to negotiate." "Paris-Normandy" said: "All French people hope that this wasteful war will end as soon as possible," and the newspaper asked the French government to "publicly explain its policy." Even the American "Washington Post" had to admit: "The obvious fact is that the Laniel-Navarre plan is directly contrary to the rising tide of sentiment in France." Recently, a group of social leaders, political leaders, and intellectuals in France issued a declaration deciding to convene a national conference to discuss ending France's dirty war of aggression in Indochina.

However, the US imperialists, regardless of the French people's demand for peace, are not only using dollars to force France to expand the flames of war in Indochina, but are also stepping up their conspiracies to actually plan this war. For example, US Vice President Nixon's recent trip to the Far East, as soon as he arrived in Honolulu, met with US Pacific Ground Forces Commander O'Daniel, who had just returned from an "Indochina trip," to discuss the so-called Indochina situation. US Ambassador to Thailand Donovan and the head of the US "Military Advisory Group" in Thailand, Gilmore, suspiciously went to Singapore to "visit" British High Commissioner Templer, which is said to be "another sign of close cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Malayan war"; at the same time, the reactionary government of Thailand, an American tool that has always been hostile to the Indochinese people's liberation war and has constantly provoked the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, also threatened to mobilize troops to prepare to "deal with the threat of foreign aggression at the end of the rainy season." Thai Air Force Brigadier General Rangsi Yakon even publicly made provocative war cries, and he, more肆无忌惮 than his master Dulles, talked about plans to attack the Asian continent.

The heroic Vietnamese People's Army and the Vietnamese people, who歼滅ed 280,000 French and Bao Dai puppet troops in the seven-year liberation war and made themselves increasingly strong, will surely continue to defeat the new military adventures of the US and French aggressors. The conspiracies and war cries of the US aggressive forces and their lackeys are proof that they are afraid of being completely defeated.

    美法侵略越南的新军事冒险
    冯之丹
    美、法政府关于美国增加对法国进行侵越战争的军事“援助”的谈判，已在九月三十日结束，并发表联合公报，正式宣布美国除前次拨给法国的四亿美元军事“援助”以外，再拨出三亿八千五百万美元的“额外款项”以扩大侵越战争。这个公报再度说明了美国侵略势力在朝鲜停战后为了维持远东紧张局势，正在加紧利用“美援”对法国拉尼埃政府施加压力，迫使法国为华尔街的利益在东方继续作战；而拉尼埃政府则屈从美国的压力，不惜在美国更加严密的控制下在越南从事新的军事冒险。
    最近美联社透露说：美国增加对法国的军事“援助”后，将要“监督使军事援助能够得到有效的利用，否则这种援助便只会等于是送到老鼠洞中。”这就是说：美国将更加直接和露骨地干涉越南战争。
    联合公报更特别强调：法国保证要“坚决实行”给印度支那三个傀儡政权以“独立”的宣言。这就意味着美国侵略势力将更进一步地排挤法国而控制印度支那。
    一切事实都证明着法国政府在美元的压力下，选择了悍然不顾法国人民要求和平解决国际问题的正当愿望，而在越南继续其侵略战争的道路。法国政府宣布将调遣驻在西欧的由摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚士兵编成的九个营到越南战场，并将侵朝的法军一个营扩大成为团调到越南。同时将加紧扩充保大伪军五十四个营，投入战争。按照美国干涉者的意图，近月以来，法国侵越军在北越平原的战场上已向人民军开始了所谓“扫荡战争”，而妄想“在军事上摧毁”越南人民军。
    法国政府拿了美元替美国作战的冒险政策，是与法国人民要求结束侵越战争的愿望背道而驰的，同时也是与法国统治阶级中某些人物表示愿望和平解决越南战争的声明相矛盾的。法国总理拉尼埃在他九月二十六日发表的演说中表示愿意进行关于结束印度支那战争的“和平谈判”。法国外交部次长舒曼也在联合国大会上表示，要在朝鲜政治会议举行期间或在政治会议以后，开始结束印度支那战争的谈判。但是，现在，根据国际新闻社九月三十日的消息说，由于法国政府拿了美国增加的军事“援助”就不得不承担了一个义务：如果没有美国的同意，法国将无权进行结束战争的谈判。因此，法国外交部发言人也不得不替舒曼在联大的含糊的和平言论解嘲，说舒曼的演说并不是指“马上举行谈判”，而是说法国现在要“大力进行战争”。当然，拉尼埃的和平论调也就一钱不值了。
    于是，美、法帝国主义正在大肆吹嘘体现美、法扩大越南战争新阴谋的“纳瓦尔军事计划”。它们甚至不顾事实地宣传法军向红河三角洲地区人民军的敌后根据地进行“扫荡”的“胜利”。然而，这些可怜的宣传家是无法改变事实的，法国侵略军及保大伪军在这次“扫荡”中遭受了惨重的失败。
    法国殖民军在七月十七日用五千伞兵部队偷袭谅山失败后，相继在河内市周围及建安、兴安、南定等省发动了大规模的“扫荡”战争。在各次战役中，越南人民军都击退了法军以大量军舰、飞机、大炮为掩护的进犯，歼灭了大量敌军。人民军自八月一日至十八日在海后县反“扫荡”战斗中，歼灭敌军一千三百四十四名，并在杜社法军据点打伤了法军第三师师长及参谋长；人民军又于九月二十三日至二十五日在红河左岸禄江以北地区粉碎了敌军十七个营的“扫荡”，歼灭敌伪军六百三十多名。红河左岸地区的游击根据地已日益扩大，使敌人后方受到重大威胁。近月以来，游击战争正在北越平原上胜利发展。人民军不仅拔除了许多法军据点，而且曾经向敌占区主要城市如海防市及建安、南定等省会进行袭击，并不断截击法军和保大伪军的交通线。在中越和南越，人民军也展开了活跃的游击战争。
    纳瓦尔的“扫荡”计划一再遭到可耻的失败，而整个红河三角洲以内法军占领的城市周围仍然密布着大片的人民军游击战根据地，这更证明了法国殖民当局及保大卖国集团已越来越无法克服其兵力不足及其有生力量不断被歼灭的危机了。人民军自西北大捷后，今年一月至九月十五日止，又歼灭了敌人两万人以上；现在法国费尽力气搜罗一些法军并扩充几万名伪军部队，是依然改变不了兵力缺乏的状况的。据八月十九日的华盛顿邮报透露，纳瓦尔本来要求从法国本部调去二万人的部队；但是拉尼埃在“看了一下所剩无几的军事储备力量以后”，就决定要削减这个数字。兵力不足这是一面；而士气低沉又是一面，特别是新编的强征来的保大伪军。据合众社报道，法国官员不得不承认伪军投降和起义的事实，并且对“新的当地人的部队”产生“广泛的焦虑了”。法国殖民者在占领区强迫征兵已遭到日益强烈的反抗。同时，摩洛哥、突尼斯、阿尔及利亚等地人民，正在进行反殖民统治的英勇斗争，法国殖民者要利用这些殖民地国家的人力作炮灰，将更加困难了。
    法国人民日益不满拉尼埃政府屈从美国继续进行印度支那战争的卑鄙行为。法国“人道报”指责拉尼埃“使法国成为雇佣军的供给者”，并指出：“只有与印度支那人民的真正代表进行谈判，并从而达成经济和文化问题上的协议，即以平等互利原则为基础的协议，才能使法国摆脱耗费巨大、死亡惨重的绝路。”“解放报”写道：“法国的舆论几乎一致要求和平，可是政府已没有自由进行谈判了。”“巴黎—诺曼底报”说：“所有的法国人都希望这个劳民伤财的战争尽快停止”，该报要求法国政府“公开说明它的政策”。甚至连美国的“华盛顿邮报”也不得不承认：“明显的事实是，拉尼埃—纳瓦尔计划与法国国内日益增长的情绪的浪潮是正面相抵触的。”最近，法国的一群社会领袖、政治领袖和知识分子发表宣言，决定召开一个全国性的会议，来讨论结束法国侵略印度支那的肮脏战争。
    可是，美帝国主义不顾法国人民的这种和平要求，不仅以美元迫使法国扩大印度支那的战火，而且正在加紧阴谋活动实际策划这个战争。譬如最近美国副总统尼克松的远东之行，一到檀香山就和才从印度支那“旅行归来”的美太平洋地面部队司令奥丹尼尔会谈所谓印度支那局势。美国驻泰国大使杜诺万和美国驻泰国的“军事顾问团”团长吉尔摩形迹可疑地前往新加坡“拜访”英国高级专员田普勒，据说这是“英、美在马来亚战争中紧密合作的又一迹象”；同时一贯敌视印度支那人民解放战争，并对越南、寮国和高棉人民不断进行挑衅的美国侵略工具泰国反动政府也扬言要调集军队准备所谓“对付在雨季结束时的外来的侵略威胁。”泰国空军准将兰格西雅康且公然进行挑衅性的战争叫嚣，他比他的主子杜勒斯更加肆无忌惮地谈起什么袭击亚洲大陆的计划来了。
    曾在七年解放战争中歼灭了法军和保大伪军二十八万人，并使自己日益壮大的英勇的越南人民军和越南人民，是一定可以继续打败美、法侵略者的新的军事冒险的。美国侵略势力及其喽囉们的阴谋活动和战争叫嚣正是它们害怕自己将被彻底击垮的明证。
