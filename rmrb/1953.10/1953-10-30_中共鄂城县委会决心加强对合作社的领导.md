    The Echeng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Resolves to Strengthen Leadership over Cooperatives

    A letter from the office of the Echeng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hubei Province: The "Reader's Letters in Brief" column on September 6th published a joint letter from Tang Tianpei, Xu Junmin, and 20 other members of the Echeng County Cooperative Federation, criticizing the County Production Office for frequently assigning tasks to cooperatives in a hasty manner. With the assistance of comrades from the Rural Work Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, our county convened a symposium of leaders from cooperatives, the County People's Government Construction Section, and the County Committee Office and other relevant departments to clarify the situation and study ways to improve our work in the future.

    In the past, the County Committee and the County Construction Section, due to insufficient understanding of the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy, blindly assigned tasks to cooperatives; or, after assigning tasks to cooperatives, the situation changed, but we did not assist the cooperatives in doing a good job of handling the aftermath. This resulted in cooperatives accumulating funds or incurring losses. In addition, some losses suffered by cooperatives were caused by their own poor management. Therefore, we have decided that the County Committee should strengthen its leadership over cooperatives in the future, designate a County Committee member to be specifically responsible for contacting cooperatives, and help cooperatives solve problems in their work; cooperatives should also regularly report their work to the County Committee. In addition, cooperatives should also educate cadres to clearly establish the principle of serving production and overcome the purely profit-oriented views of some cadres.

    中共鄂城县委会决心加强对合作社的领导
    中共湖北省鄂城县委会办公室来信：九月六日“读者来信摘要”栏发表了鄂城县合作总社唐天培、徐俊民等二十二人联名来信，对县生产办公室经常草率地给合作社布置任务的做法提出批评。在中共湖北省委农村工作部同志的协助下，我县召开了合作社、县人民政府建设科和县委办公室等有关部门负责人的座谈会，弄清了情况，并研究了今后改进工作的办法。
    过去县委会和县建设科曾因对小农经济特点认识不足，盲目给合作社布置工作；或者在向合作社布置任务后情况变化，而没有协助合作社做好善后工作。这样就使合作社积压资金或者亏本。此外，合作社所受的某些损失，是自己经营不善而造成的。因此，我们决定：今后县委应加强对合作社的领导，指定一个县委委员专门负责和合作社联系，并帮助合作社解决工作中的问题；合作社也该定期向县委汇报工作。此外，合作社也要教育干部明确树立合作社为生产服务的方针，克服某些干部的单纯营利观点。
