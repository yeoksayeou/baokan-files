Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 26th: The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic held a special meeting on the 24th and decided to reduce the prices of 12,000 kinds of food and consumer goods by 10 to 50 percent, effective October 26th. This is the largest price reduction since the implementation of the Republic's new policy. The successful completion of the economic plan, the increase in labor productivity, the development of daily consumer goods production, and the assistance of the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries have made this new price reduction possible. This price reduction will increase the people's purchasing power by 540 million marks by the end of 1953. At the same time, due to the recent reduction in income tax, it is estimated that the real wages of working people will increase by 350 million marks in the 1954 fiscal year.

Among the price reductions, meat prices were reduced by 10 percent, canned fish by 20 percent, animal fat by 22 percent, margarine by 25 percent, milk by 20 percent, cigarettes by 13 percent, textiles by 15 to 27.5 percent, cameras by 25 percent, and musical instruments by 25 percent.

The democratic republic's repeated price reductions are an important sign of peaceful construction and improvement of people's lives. At the Council of Ministers meeting that decided on this price reduction, Premier Grotewohl pointed out that this measure has far-reaching political and economic significance, and it is another important step towards abolishing the rationing system. He praised the working people of the German Democratic Republic for launching a broad labor emulation movement under the slogan "1954 is a year of great labor creativity," which will guarantee the victorious implementation of the new policy.

    德意志民主共和国减低一万多种物品价格
    【新华社柏林二十六日电】德意志民主共和国部长会议于二十四日举行特别会议，决定自十月二十六日起减低一万二千种食品及消费品的价格百分之十到五十。这是共和国实行新方针以来最大规模一次的减价。经济计划的顺利完成，劳动生产率的提高，日用消费品生产的发展以及苏联和各人民民主国家的帮助，使得这次新的减价成为可能。这次减价的结果将使人民的购买力，到一九五三年底，增加五亿四千万马克。同时，由于最近所得税的减低，估计在一九五四年度内，劳动人民的实际工资将增加三亿五千万马克。
    在这次降低物价中，肉类价格降低了百分之十，鱼罐头食品百分之二十，动物脂肪百分之二十二，人造牛油百分之二十五，牛奶百分之二十，纸烟百分之十三，纺织品百分之十五到二十七点五，照相机百分之二十五，乐器百分之二十五。
    民主共和国迭次减低物价，是和平建设和人民生活改善的重要标志。在决定这次减低物价的部长会议上，格罗提渥总理指出，这个措施具有远大的政治和经济意义，这是走向取消配给制的又一个重要步骤。他对德意志民主共和国劳动人民将在“一九五四年是伟大的劳动创造性的一年”的口号下展开广泛的劳动竞赛运动表示称许，这个运动将保证新方针的胜利实施。
