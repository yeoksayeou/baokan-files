Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th - The US side continues to refuse to provide the equipment needed for the explanation work, in order to delay the start of the explanation work, while insisting that the explanation period should not be extended accordingly due to the delayed start. The facts have increasingly shown that the US side plans to undermine the explanation work by delaying the start of the explanation work and shortening the ninety-day explanation period stipulated in the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission."

    According to the explanation location proposed by the US side and the US design, the Korean and Chinese sides have started to construct the explanation equipment used by the US side at the Indian Custodial Forces camp in Songgok-ri, north of the demilitarized zone. US military officers visited these explanation sites under construction on the 3rd.

    However, the US side is still delaying the construction of the explanation equipment for the Korean and Chinese sides. According to the news received by the Korean and Chinese sides today, the US side stated that it would not make any "commitments" as to whether it was willing to carry out the construction suggested by the Korean and Chinese sides. The US side also claimed that the construction of the temporary equipment for explanation could only be completed within seven days after the date of approval of the construction by the "United Nations Command," and the formal equipment separately located at the two locations suggested by the Korean and Chinese sides would take twenty and thirty days respectively to complete after the approval of the construction.

    The US side's delay in starting the explanation work has ulterior motives. As of today, one hundred and eleven Korean and Chinese prisoners of war have broken through the control of special agents and demanded repatriation without going through explanation. The US side is obviously afraid that a large number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war will demand repatriation after accepting explanation, thus completely exposing the US side's lie that Korean and Chinese prisoners of war "refuse repatriation."

    Coordinated with the US side's plan to delay and undermine the explanation work, and Hamblen's and Clark's threats and "protests" against the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, special agents in the Indian Custodial Forces camp are attempting to attack the Indian Custodial Forces and create "riots" and "mass escapes." After two recent riots created by special agents in the Indian Custodial Forces camp, US and Kuomintang news agencies hinted that more "bloodshed and riots" would occur in these camps. A message issued by the Kuomintang Central News Agency on the 3rd openly threatened that "when all the anti-communist prisoners of war launch a mass escape at the same time, it is believed that the Indian Custodial Forces will not have sufficient strength to stop the escape. All the prisoner of war camps are only surrounded by four barbed wire fences that are easy to pull out and push down." The Associated Press reported that there was "an upcoming hunger strike" in the Indian Custodial Forces camp. It is meaningful that the US and Kuomintang news agencies often know the news before the riots in the prisoner of war camps have even occurred.

    At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek's and Syngman Rhee's special agents are intensifying their reign of terror over the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. In a camp under the supervision of the Indian Custodial Forces, nine Korean People's Army prisoners of war are said to be "missing." A US news agency said, "These nine prisoners of war may have been killed, and other prisoners have buried the bodies." Returnees recently repatriated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission said that they saw special agents digging pits in the Indian Custodial Forces camp. Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war repatriated today witnessed Chiang Kai-shek's special agents kill a prisoner of war yesterday afternoon who revealed his desire to return to his motherland, dig out his heart, and then bury his body.

### 美方企图以拖延办法缩短解释工作的期限

    美方企图以拖延办法缩短解释工作的期限
    【新华社开城四日电】美方继续拒绝提供解释工作所需要的设备，以拖延解释工作的开始，同时又坚持解释期限不能因延期开始而相应地予以顺延。事实已越来越明显地说明，美方计划用拖延解释工作的开始，和缩短“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”中所规定的九十天的解释期限，来破坏解释工作。
    朝中方面已根据美方提出的解释地点和美方的设计，在非军事区北部松谷里印度看管部队营场开工修建美方使用的解释设备。美方军官已在三日前往参观了这些修建中的解释场所。
    但美方则仍然拖延供朝中方面使用的解释设备的修建，根据朝中方面今天所收到的消息，美方表示对是否愿意进行朝中方面所建议的修建不作任何
  “承诺”，美方并声称供解释用的临时设备的修建，在“联合国军”批准修建的日期后的七天内才能完成，分设在朝中方面建议的两处地点的正规设备，则需在批准修建后的二十天及三十天内完成。
    美方拖延解释工作的开始有其不可告人的原因。到今天为止，已经有一百十一名朝中被俘人员没有经过解释就突破特务的控制要求遣返，美方显然害怕大批朝中被俘人员在接受解释后，要求遣返，从而彻底揭穿美方所谓朝中被俘人员“拒绝遣返”的谎话。
    配合着美方拖延破坏解释工作的计划，及汉布伦和克拉克对中立国遣返委员会的威胁和“抗议”，在印度看管部队营场中的特务分子，正企图攻击印度看管部队，制造“暴乱”和“集体逃亡”事件。在印度看管部队营场中最近发生两次特务制造的骚乱之后，美国与国民党的通讯社暗示这些营场中将会发生更多的“流血和暴乱”。国民党中央社在三日发出的一条消息中公然威胁说，“在所有的反共战俘同时发动集体逃亡时，人们相信印度看管部队将没有充分力量制止逃亡。所有的战俘营场仅仅围着四道很容易拔掉和推倒的铁丝网。”合众社则报道印度看管部队营场中有“一次即将到来的绝食运动”。意味深长的是美国和国民党的通讯社，经常在战俘营的骚乱还没有发生以前，就已知道消息。
    同时，蒋介石和李承晚的特务分子，正在加紧对朝中被俘人员的恐怖统治。在印度看管部队看管下的一个营场里，有九个朝鲜人民军战俘据说是“失踪”了。一家美国通讯社说，“这九个战俘可能已被杀死，别的战俘埋掉了尸体”。最近由中立国遣返委员会遣返的归来人员说，他们看到特务在印度看管部队的营场挖坑。今天遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员在昨天下午目睹蒋介石特务杀掉一个流露了要回祖国的情绪的战俘，把他的心挖出来，然后埋掉了他的尸体。
