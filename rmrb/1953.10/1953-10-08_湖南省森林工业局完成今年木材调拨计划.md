The Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau completed its timber allocation plan for this year in the first half of September, supplying over 400,000 cubic meters of timber to more than 300 basic construction units across the country. This includes timber supplied to Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Central China Iron and Steel Company, the textile administration bureaus of the Northwest and Southwest, and various units under the Central People's Government's Ministry of Machine Building Industry, Ministry of Fuel Industry, Ministry of Railways, and Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. Ninety-five percent of this timber consists of raw fir and pine logs, mine props, and railway ties used for building factories and dormitories, laying tracks, installing utility poles, and supporting mine shafts.

This year, all cadres and workers of the Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm in timber production. To ensure the timely supply of timber for national basic construction, they completed the annual logging task ahead of schedule in May this year. They also overcame various difficulties in transporting timber. During the drought and shallow waters of July and August, timber was trapped in the mountains and unable to be transported. The Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau organized various transportation units to make every possible effort to rush the transport. Transport workers took advantage of the dry weather to complete mountain and land transport first. As soon as it rained and the water rose, they immediately bundled shallow-water rafts and adopted a segmented transport method, greatly improving transport efficiency. By the end of August, the province had completed 60% of the annual timber transport task. Loggers and timber transporters in various forest areas have also made great achievements in increasing production and practicing economy. Timber transporters in the Yuan River and Zi River basins used a method of bundling rafts without drilling water holes, and changed to using bamboo ropes to transport rafts. Workers in Jianghua and Lingling used uncut tow poles to transport rafts, saving the country timber worth over 15 billion yuan each year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    湖南省森林工业局完成今年木材调拨计划
    湖南省森林工业局在九月上半月，已完成今年供应全国三百多个基本建设单位的木材调拨计划。计供应鞍山钢铁公司、华中钢铁公司、西北和西南等地的纺织管理局以及中央人民政府机械工业部、燃料工业部、铁道部、邮电部等所属各单位的木材，共达四十多万立方公尺。这些木材有百分之九十五是建筑厂房、宿舍、铺设路轨、装置电杆及支撑矿洞用的杉松原条、坑木、枕木等。
    今年湖南省森林工业局的全体干部和工人，在木材生产中发挥了高度的积极性。为了如期供应国家基本建设用材，他们在今年五月就提前完成了全年的采伐任务。在运输木材中，他们又克服了各种困难。七、八月份天旱水浅，木材存在山里运不出；湖南省森林工业局便组织各运输单位利用一切可能设法抢运；运木工人趁天旱期间，先做好山运、陆运，一等下雨水涨，立刻扎成浅水木簰，采用分段运输法，使运输效率大大提高。到八月底，全省已完成全年木材运输任务百分之六十。各个林区的伐木工人、运木工人在增产节约方面也做出很大成绩，沅水、资水流域运木工人用不打水眼的方法编扎木簰，改用篾招运簰，江华、零陵两地工人用不砍口的招杆运簰，每年可为国家节约木材价值达一百五十多亿元。　（新华社）
