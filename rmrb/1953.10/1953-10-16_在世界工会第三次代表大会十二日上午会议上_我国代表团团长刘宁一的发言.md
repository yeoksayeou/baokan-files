(Continued from yesterday)

After liberation, female workers have achieved equal pay for equal work. The days of having no social status and being oppressed and insulted are gone forever.

Countless female workers have become active participants in industrial production and have mastered various complex production technologies. They are competently undertaking the glorious task of peaceful construction in various work positions of national construction. There are now female train drivers, car drivers, tram drivers, tractor drivers, welders, iron smelters, bricklayers, drillers, bulldozer operators, survey teams, etc. For example, female bulldozer operator Hu Youmei, at the foot of the snow-capped Wushaoling Mountains in Northwest China, dedicated her greatest energy and wisdom to building the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway to bring a happy life to the people of all ethnic groups in Northwest China. With unparalleled perseverance, she broke through wind and snow, driving a bulldozer and turning over sand and soil, bravely working for the cause of peaceful construction of the motherland.

Before liberation, labor for Chinese workers was enslaved, painful, and a heavy burden. Now, they labor for their own interests, for the prosperity of the country, and for the happiness of the people. Labor has become a glorious, happy, and heroic undertaking.

In terms of cultural life, trade union organizations, with the assistance of state-owned and private enterprise administrations, have established 16,277 spare-time cultural literacy schools, with 3,087,000 workers participating in learning nationwide. 535,000 illiterate workers have been eliminated. Various spare-time technical learning classes and technical research associations have been held, with 477,000 workers participating in such spare-time technical learning nationwide.

Among the 8,000 students at the nationally renowned Renmin University of China, 70 percent are revolutionary cadres and industrial workers. Model worker Li Fenglian, for example, is studying at this university. Countless workers and peasants are entering worker-peasant rapid middle schools and worker-peasant rapid elementary schools. In 1952, the number of students entering worker-peasant rapid middle schools was 411 percent of that in 1950, and the number of students entering worker-peasant rapid elementary schools increased by another 78 percent compared to 1951. Our new-type intellectuals with worker and peasant backgrounds are being rapidly cultivated.

For example, Li Xiuying, a female worker at the Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill, had been working since the age of eight and had never attended school. After liberation, she participated in a rapid literacy class and has now memorized more than 2,400 characters, can read general popular books and newspapers, and can also write short articles. Li Xiuying said, "With the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, I, an almost forty-year-old illiterate woman, can open my eyes and read!" She wrote a letter to Comrade Mao Zedong thanking him for leading the workers to turn over culturally. Another example is Sun Zhujun, a female bookbinder at the Beijing Workers' Daily Printing Factory, who had never studied since childhood. After studying for a year and a half after liberation, she can recognize more than 3,000 characters and can read newspapers and novels. The broad masses of workers, who were deprived of the right to learn culture in the old society, are now gradually becoming laborers with culture and knowledge in the new China, and they will contribute more wisdom to our country's construction.

Trade union organizations in various places have published various workers' newspapers and periodicals and a large number of workers' reading materials. With the support of the People's Government, they have also established 364 cultural palaces and clubs,开展了various mass spare-time cultural and sports activities, enlivening and improving the cultural life of the workers.

In our motherland's construction, trade unions play a huge role.

Under the unified leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, 180,000 grassroots organizations have been established, absorbing 10,200,000 members. In recent years, trade union cadre schools alone have trained 111,000 cadres. Trade union organizations have recommended 107,000 cadres to the leadership organs of the People's Government at all levels. A total of 124,000 workers have been promoted to engineering and technical personnel and management personnel, including 7,800 who have become factory directors and deputy factory directors. Our trade union organizations have become a strong social pillar of the people's democratic dictatorship.

The Chinese working class and the Chinese people are working with the greatest enthusiasm to complete the first Five-Year Plan and striving to gradually realize national industrialization and transition to a socialist society.

During China's first Five-Year Plan period, China's industry will have tremendous development. More iron, steel, coal, electricity, petroleum, non-ferrous metals, machines, building materials, chemical products, and light industrial products will be supplied to the needs of the country and the people; many kinds of industrial products that have never been manufactured in China's history will begin to be produced.

Taking the first year of China's Five-Year Construction Plan—1953—as an example, the total output value of industrial production will increase by about 23 percent compared to 1952. Among them, state-owned industry will increase by about 32 percent. The percentage increase of various major products nationwide compared to 1952 will be: pig iron 13.3, steel 34.8, copper 28.6, electricity 18.3, crude oil 29.1, generators 190.9, cement 29.7, cotton yarn 9.4, cotton cloth 10.5, timber 38. This year, many factories and mines have begun construction, including coal mines, oil wells, automobile manufacturing plants, heavy machinery manufacturing plants, electrical machinery manufacturing plants, machine tool manufacturing plants, shipbuilding plants, locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing plants, and textile machinery manufacturing plants. The level of industrial production in our country will greatly increase, which will further consolidate the national defense of our motherland, more powerfully guarantee peace in the Far East and the world, and also guarantee the further needs of the national laboring people's cultural and material life.

China's industrial construction tasks are very arduous, related to the safety of our country and the happiness of the people, and related to the cause of world peace. The Chinese workers bravely shoulder this glorious task.

Chinese men and women workers are launching patriotic labor emulation drives with full confidence. They are striving to increase labor productivity, improve product quality, reduce costs, and strive to complete the national plan ahead of schedule.

The Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, held on the occasion of this year's "May 1st" International Labor Day, was a mobilization meeting to organize and mobilize the broad masses of Chinese workers and staff to fight for the high tide of our country's economic construction. Patriotic labor emulation campaigns in all enterprises in our country have been launched enthusiastically.

China's vigorous development of production and continuous improvement of material and cultural standards more practically and concretely illustrate the peaceful direction of China's economic development than any words.

Our leader Comrade Mao Zedong said in 1949: "Our nation will henceforth be included in the big family of all nations in the world that love peace and freedom, working with a brave and diligent attitude, creating its own civilization and happiness, and also promoting world peace and freedom." Our people are realizing this brilliant instruction, devoting themselves to peaceful construction labor, and caring about the establishment of lasting world peace.

The interests of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people are completely consistent with the interests of the working class and peace-loving people of all countries in the world.

Our sacred duty is to defend and consolidate the peace and democracy camp and strengthen the unity of the people of all countries in the struggle for peace.

The Chinese working class and the Chinese people have supported the struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army against aggression with their practical actions. Now, Korea has finally achieved an armistice, which is a great victory for the entire peace and democracy camp and also a great victory for the world peace movement. However, the creators of war and adventurous actions, first of all, the American warmongers, do not stop because of their failures. Contrary to the ideas of the vast majority of peace-loving humanity around the world, they are continuing to intensify their "Cold War strategy" and carry out various international provocations, creating an atmosphere of international tension and attempting to undermine political conferences. We must be very vigilant about the plots and tricks of the enemies of peace. The Chinese working class and the Chinese people will make unremitting efforts to promote the smooth convening of political conferences on a sound and reasonable basis so that the upcoming political conferences can peacefully resolve the Korean issue and ease international tensions. We believe that all international disputes should be resolved by peaceful means.

Chinese trade union organizations have widely carried out signature campaigns in factories and mines across the country against the armed rearmament of West Germany and Japan and to defend world peace, as well as signature campaigns to demand the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. The Chinese working class regards defending peace in the Far East and the world as its sacred task.

The Chinese trade union is a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions. We faithfully implement the resolutions of the World Federation of Trade Unions and regard the development and consolidation of the unity of the world working class as our major international task.

One month after the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, that is, in November 1949, the World Federation of Trade Unions convened the Asian and Australian Trade Union Representatives Conference in Beijing. This conference promoted the development of the workers' movement in Asia and Australia and promoted the unity and unification of the workers' movement in Asia, Australia, and the world.

The Chinese working class has infinite sympathy for the suffering and persecution encountered by class brothers and sisters in capitalist countries and colonies and dependencies. We have a duty to assist them in their heroic struggles for national independence and people's democracy.

Chinese trade unions have established friendly ties with the working classes of many countries. In the past four years, we have sent various delegations to participate in international trade union activities organized by the World Federation of Trade Unions. At the same time, we have also invited representatives from 28 countries to visit China, exchange experiences in various fields, increase contacts in various fields, and increase mutual understanding and friendship.

The friendly ties between the Chinese working class and the working classes of various countries have strengthened the international solidarity of the working class in the Far East and the world, playing a positive role in further promoting peace in the Far East and the world.

The unbreakable great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is extremely helpful to the unity of the working class around the world. And the unity of the working class around the world is necessary for achieving lasting peace and universal security.

The Chinese trade union believes that its important task is to do its best to develop and strengthen friendship and close cooperation between the working people of China and the Soviet Union.

The truth pointed out by Comrade Stalin is: "If the people of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace and persevere in this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated." He also taught us: "The great friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's of Republic of China is a reliable guarantee against the threat of new aggression and a strong fortress for peace in the Far East and the world."

Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "The friendship between the great people of China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable because our friendship is based on the great internationalist principles of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union and the people of all people's democratic countries, and the friendship between all peace-loving, democratic, and just people in all countries of the world, is also based on such great internationalist principles, and therefore, it is also unbreakable.

Obviously, the power generated by our friendship is infinite and truly invincible."

The international task of the Chinese trade union is to, under the correct leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions, unswervingly fight to strengthen the unity and unification of the workers' movement in the Far East and the world and to strive for lasting peace.

The Chinese working class and the people of the whole country are more full of confidence in victory today than at any time in the past. We must support each other with the international working class and all peace-loving people and fight for the further unity and unification of the international workers' movement and the cause of defending world peace. In the new period of national construction, with the lofty friendly assistance of the great Soviet Union and with the support of the working classes of all countries around the world, we must fight to realize the instructions of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, to realize the work tasks of the Chinese working class mass organization—the Chinese trade union—in the construction period, that is, to realize the task of our country's industrialization and gradual transition to a socialist society.

Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions!
Long live the unity of the working class of the world!

    在世界工会第三次代表大会十二日上午会议上
    我国代表团团长刘宁一的发言
    　（续昨）
    女工在解放后取得了同工同酬的平等待遇。过去那样的没有社会地位，受压迫和侮辱的日子，已是一去不复返了。
    无数的女工已成为工业生产的积极分子，已能掌握各种复杂的生产技术，在国家建设事业的各种工作岗位上，都已胜任愉快地担负起和平建设的光荣任务。出现了女的火车司机、汽车司机、电车司机、拖拉机手、电焊工、炼铁炉工、瓦工、钻探工、推土机手、测量队等等。如女推土机手胡友梅在祖国西北终年积雪的乌鞘岭下，为了筑成兰新铁路，好给我国西北各族人民带来幸福的生活，胡友梅献出了自己最大的精力和智慧，用无比坚韧的精神，冲破风雪，驾驶着推土机，翻掀着沙土，为祖国和平建设事业而勇敢地劳动着。
    中国工人在解放前劳动是被奴役的、痛苦的、繁重的负担，现在却为自己的利益、为国家的富强和人民的幸福而劳动，劳动已成为光荣、愉快和英勇的事业了。
    在文化生活方面，工会组织协助国营的和私营的企业行政建立了一万六千二百七十七所业余文化补习学校，全国参加学习的工人有三百零八万七千人。在工人中扫除了五十三万五千名文盲。已举办了各种业余技术学习班和技术研究会，全国参加这种业余技术学习的工人有四十七万七千人。
    在全国著名的中国人民大学的八千个学员中，百分之七十是革命干部和产业工人。如劳动模范李凤莲等就在这个大学里读书。无数工人、农民进入工农速成中学和工农速成初等学校读书，一九五二年进工农速成中学的学员为一九五○年的百分之四百十一，进工农速成初等学校的学员比一九五一年又增加百分之七十八。我们的工农成份的新型知识分子正在迅速地培养中。
    如李秀英是武汉市第一纱厂的女工，从八岁做工，没有进过学校，解放后参加了速成识字学习班，现在已经记熟了两千四百多个字，能阅读一般通俗读物和报纸，也会写短文了。李秀英说：“有了毛主席的英明领导，我这快四十岁的瞎婆子，能睁开眼识得字了。”她写信给毛泽东同志感谢他领导工人在文化上翻了身。又如北京工人日报印刷厂的装订女工孙竹筠，从小没有读过书，在解放后学习了一年半，能认识三千多字，能看报，看小说。广大的工人群众被旧社会剥夺了学文化的权利，在新中国却已在逐步地变为有文化、有知识的劳动者，他们将在我国建设事业中，贡献出更多的智慧。
    各地工会组织刊行了各种工人报刊，出版了大量的工人读物。并在人民政府的支持下，举办了三百六十四所文化宫和俱乐部，开展了各种群众性的业余文化、体育活动，活跃与提高了工人群众的文化生活。
    在我们祖国建设事业中，工会起着巨大的作用。
    在中华全国总工会统一领导下，已建立了十八万个基层组织，吸收了一千零二十万会员。几年来仅工会干部学校即训练了干部十一万一千人。工会组织向人民政府的各级领导机关推荐了十万七千个干部，被提拔为工程技术人员和管理人员的工人共十二万四千人，其中做厂长和副厂长的共七千八百人。我国的工会组织已经成为人民民主专政的坚强的社会支柱。
    中国工人阶级与中国人民，正以最大的热情为完成第一个五年计划而努力，为逐步实现国家工业化与过渡到社会主义社会而斗争。
    在我国第一个五年计划时期内，我国的工业将有巨大的发展。将有更多的钢铁、煤、电力、石油、有色金属、机器、建筑材料、化学产品和轻工业品供给国家和人民的需要；将有许多种我国历史上从未制造过的工业产品开始生产出来。
    即以我国五年建设计划的头一年——一九五三年的建设规模来说，工业生产的总产值比一九五二年将增长百分之二十三左右。其中国营工业将增长百分之三十二左右。全国各种主要产品比一九五二年增长的百分数将为：生铁一三·三，钢材三四·八，铜二八·六，电力一八·三，原油二九·一，发电机一九○·九，水泥二九·七，棉纱九·四，棉布一○·五，木材三八。今年已有许多工厂、矿山开始建设了，有煤矿、油井、汽车制造厂、重型机械制造厂、电器机械制造厂、工作母机制造厂、船舶制造厂、机车车辆制造厂及纺织机械制造厂等。我国工业生产水平将有很大的增长，这将更加巩固我们祖国的国防，更有力地保证远东与世界的和平，也将保证全国劳动人民文化与物质生活进一步的需要。
    我国的工业建设任务是十分艰巨的，是关系着我国的安全和人民的幸福，关系着世界和平事业的。中国工人是勇敢地担当起这个光荣任务来了。
    中国男女工人正满怀信心地开展着爱国主义劳动竞赛。为提高劳动生产率、提高产品质量、降低成本，争取提前完成国家计划而斗争。
    在今年“五一”国际劳动节之际，召开的中国工会第七次全国代表大会，就是为了组织与动员我国广大职工群众迎接我国经济建设高潮而奋斗的动员大会。我国所有企业里的爱国主义劳动竞赛已经热烈地展开了。
    中国人民的大力发展生产，不断提高物质和文化水平，比任何言词都要切实地、具体地说明了中国经济发展的和平方向。
    我们的领袖毛泽东同志在一九四九年时说：“我们的民族将从此列入爱好和平自由的世界各民族的大家庭，以勇敢而勤劳的姿态工作着，创造自己的文明和幸福，同时也促进世界的和平和自由。”我国人民正实现着这个英明的指示，致力于和平建设劳动，关怀着建立持久的世界和平。
    中国工人阶级和中国人民的利益，和全世界工人阶级以及各国爱好和平人民的利益是完全一致的。
    我们的神圣职责就是要保卫和巩固和平、民主阵营，加强各国人民争取和平斗争中的团结。
    中国工人阶级和中国人民以自己的实际行动支持了中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军反对侵略的斗争。现在朝鲜终于实现了停战，这是整个和平、民主阵营的巨大胜利，也是世界和平运动的巨大胜利。但是战争和冒险行动的制造者首先是美国好战分子并不因为他们的失败而罢手，和全世界绝大多数爱好和平人类的想法相反，他们还在继续加紧进行“冷战战略”和进行各种国际挑衅，制造国际紧张空气和企图破坏政治会议。我们要十分警惕地注视着和平敌人的阴谋诡计。中国工人阶级和中国人民将以不懈的努力来促成政治会议在健全合理的基础上顺利召开，使即将召开的政治会议能够和平地解决朝鲜问题、缓和国际紧张局势。我们认为一切国际争端应该用和平方法解决。
    中国工会组织在全国各厂矿中曾广泛地开展了反对武装西德和日本重新军国主义化与保卫世界和平的签名运动及要求缔结五大国和平公约的签名运动。中国工人阶级把保卫远东和世界和平当作自己的神圣任务。
    中国工会是世界工会联合会的会员之一。我们忠实地执行世界工会联合会的决议把发展与巩固世界工人阶级的团结统一，作为自己重大的国际任务。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立一月后，即一九四九年十一月，世界工会联合会在北京召开了亚洲、澳洲工会代表会议，这次会议促进了亚洲、澳洲工人运动的发展，促进了亚洲、澳洲和世界工人运动的团结与统一。
    中国工人阶级对资本主义国家及殖民地与附属国的阶级兄弟所遭遇的痛苦与迫害，寄予无限的同情。我们对他们为民族独立与人民民主所进行的英勇斗争，是有援助的义务的。
    中国工会和许多国家的工人阶级建立了友谊的联系。在四年当中，我们曾派遣了各种代表团参加世界工会联合会所主持的国际工会活动。同时也邀请过二十八个国家的代表，先后来中国参观，交换了各方面的经验，增加了各方面的联系，增加了相互的了解与友谊。
    中国工人阶级与各国工人阶级的友谊联系，加强了远东以及世界工人阶级的国际团结，对于进一步促进远东和世界和平起了积极的作用。
    中苏两国人民的牢不可破的伟大友谊，是极有助于全世界工人阶级的团结的。而全世界工人阶级的团结，乃是争取持久和平与普遍安全所必需的。
    中国工会认为它的重要任务就是尽全力发展和加强中苏两国劳动人民之间的友谊与密切合作。
    斯大林同志指出的真理是：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业坚持到底，和平就能够保持和巩固”。他又教导我们说：“苏联和中华人民共和国之间的伟大友谊是反对新侵略威胁的可靠保证，是远东及全世界和平的坚强堡垒。”
    毛泽东同志教导我们说：“伟大的中苏两国人民的友谊之所以是牢不可破的，因为我们的友谊是根据马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大的国际主义的原则而建立起来的。中苏两国人民和各人民民主国家人民之间的友谊，和全世界各国一切爱好和平、民主及正义的人民之间的友谊，也正是建立在这样伟大的国际主义原则上，因此，也就是牢不可破的。
    显然，我们这种友谊所产生的力量是无穷无尽和真正无敌的。”
    中国工会的国际任务，就是要在世界工会联合会的正确领导之下，始终不渝地为加强远东和世界工人运动的团结和统一，争取持久和平而斗争。
    中国工人阶级和全国人民，今天比过去任何时候都更加充满胜利的信心。我们一定要和国际工人阶级及一切爱好和平的人士互相支持，为国际工人运动更进一步的团结与统一，和保卫世界和平的事业而斗争。我们在祖国建设的新时期中，在伟大苏联的崇高的友谊援助之下，在全世界各国工人阶级支持下，一定要为实现中国共产党和毛泽东同志的指示，为实现中国工人阶级群众组织——中国工会在建设时期的工作任务，即为实现我们国家工业化并逐步过渡到社会主义社会的任务而斗争。
    世界工会联合会万岁！
    全世界工人阶级团结万岁！
