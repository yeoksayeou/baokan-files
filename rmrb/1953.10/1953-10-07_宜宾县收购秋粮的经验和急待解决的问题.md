    Experiences and Problems to be Solved Urgently in the Autumn Grain Purchase in Yibin County
       Hu Wenying
    This year, Yibin County, Sichuan Province, achieved success in the autumn grain purchase work because, under the unified leadership of the County Finance and Economics Committee, the Grain Company fully relied on cooperatives and learned from the experience of last year's grain purchase work. The August monthly purchase plan was overfulfilled by 119.5 percent.

    Last year, Yibin County's grain purchase work started relatively late. In a few areas, private merchants took the opportunity to lower prices because the Grain Company did not purchase in time, and the market price was lower than the listed price by more than 30 percent, causing great losses to farmers. At the same time, too few purchase points were set up, making it very inconvenient for farmers to sell grain. The county has a radius of more than 400 li, with 72 market towns, but only 23 purchase points were set up. Some farmers had to carry grain 60 or 70 li to reach a purchase station. The purchase procedures were also very cumbersome. From quality inspection to payment, it took many procedures, and farmers had to spend half a day selling grain. In terms of "quality inspection and grading," the inspectors did not accurately grasp the standards, and there were cases of being too high or too low. In order to complete the purchase task, the Grain Company even forced farmers to sell grain, which caused farmers to doubt the government's purchase policy, thereby generating a reluctance to sell.

    This year, before the autumn grain purchase work began, the County Finance and Economics Committee of Yibin County, in order to improve the above shortcomings, convened the grain department and cooperatives to jointly study this year's purchase task and formulate a purchase plan. In order to improve the relationship between the grain department and the cooperatives, both parties reached an agreement on agency purchase and acceptance, and made specific arrangements for agency purchase, joint purchase procedures, and personnel organization. The number of purchase points was also increased from 23 last year to 45. There is now a purchase point in every area less than 30 li in the county, making it very convenient for farmers to sell grain. The purchase procedures have also been simplified as much as possible. Drawing on the experience of wheat purchase this year, the "assembly line operation method for purchase" was implemented, simplifying the five procedures for wheat purchase into three. The original purchase required four or five people, but now only three are needed, and 4,000 jin can be purchased per hour, increasing work efficiency by 30 percent, and also preventing phenomena such as "overweighting," "grain loss," and "altering receipts." In implementing the policy of "grading according to quality and pricing," each purchase point has set up yellow rice grade samples to facilitate farmers to check their grain grade according to the samples, reducing the deviation and disputes in quality inspection. In terms of fund allocation, in order to achieve "timely use of funds and prevent default purchases," in addition to the bank department organizing cash allocation according to the Grain Company's "five-day fund use plan," the grain, bank, and tax departments also closely liaised, exchanged fund use methods, and accelerated capital allocation. In areas where there is no bank, the purchase points can withdraw money from the tax department with the Grain Company's fund use documents, and the tax department can also remit to the bank with the Grain Company's fund use documents, avoiding the mutual transportation of cash and delays en route. In addition, the purchase cadres of the grain department and the cooperatives, under the leadership of the district finance and economics team, conducted publicity on the autumn grain purchase to farmers, strengthened education for farmers, and made farmers understand that selling surplus grain is a patriotic action to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, support cities, and develop urban-rural trade, thereby voluntarily selling surplus grain to the state, avoiding the mistakes of "coercive orders," "average apportionment," and "door-to-door purchase" in last year's autumn grain purchase work.

    In early August, when new grain came on the market, thanks to the above measures, farmers were very enthusiastic about selling grain, but a series of new and urgent problems also arose:

      1. The purchase plan is too small, far from meeting the farmers' demands for selling grain. Although the August plan was overfulfilled by more than 100 percent, the plan was supplemented and adjusted four times in terms of fund use. 84.6 percent of the September purchase funds have been used in advance, causing difficulties for the bank in capital allocation, and "default purchases" have occurred at Shuangshi, Guanyin and other purchase stations due to insufficient funds. The reason for the Grain Department's small purchase plan is that it underestimated the new situation of increased rice production this year, the early autumn harvest, and the general increase in farmers' demand for means of production and means of livelihood. Therefore, the plan must be re-compiled according to the actual situation in September and October. This is a very important issue and should be paid attention to.

    2. The supply of materials by relevant departments to cooperate with the autumn purchase is not good enough. At present, the Grain Company is releasing a large amount of goods in the county, but relevant units have not prepared the source of goods well and organized the recovery, and the means of production and means of livelihood cannot meet the needs of farmers. For example, the salt of Yongxing and Baihua cooperatives, the agricultural tools of the sixteenth district (such as bamboo baskets and drying mats), and the cotton yarn of the Juexi Department Store have all been out of stock, and the supply of cloth, batteries, and fertilizer in other regions is also not timely. Many farmers sell yellow rice in order to buy the production and livelihood materials they urgently need. Because they cannot buy what they need, they take the yellow rice back, which affects the farmers' enthusiasm for selling grain. The main reason for the shortage of materials is that state-owned trade and cooperatives underestimated the significant increase in farmers' purchasing power after the new grain was on the market. At the same time, the erroneous thinking of "fear of overstocking, not fear of stockout" and "rather stockout than overstocking" still exists seriously. Therefore, they do not maintain a reasonable inventory regularly, but rather sell as they go. This irresponsible business style should be quickly improved.

    3. The cadres of the grain department and the cooperatives do not have a sufficient understanding of the political significance of this year's autumn grain purchase, and do not understand that the autumn grain purchase is a concrete work to protect the interests of farmers, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and support urban construction. The cadres of the Grain Company have the idea of "heavy task, fear of not completing it," and the cadres of the cooperatives believe that in the implementation of agency purchase and joint purchase business, "the benefits are small and the troubles are many." For example, the cooperatives in Xujia, Baima and other places were initially unwilling to sign agency purchase contracts with the Grain Company. Some purchase cadres do not take into account the characteristics of farmers' small-scale economy, and do not follow farmers' habits and requirements, but unilaterally implement the so-called "office work system." Farmers carry grain from very far away, but the purchase cadres refuse to purchase because they think "the time has passed" or "the time has not arrived." For example, a farmer in the fourteenth district carried grain from more than 20 li away. Because it was late, the purchase cadre said: "We won't collect it today, bring it back tomorrow." The Zhenxi Township Cooperative only collects grain on market days, and does not collect it on "idle" days. In terms of inspecting the quality, some purchase cadres believe that the price of grain is high this year, and farmers sell a lot of grain, so there is a tendency to "rather high than low" and raise the quality for purchase. On the other hand, such as the Kongtan purchase team, they inspect and grade when there are few farmers selling grain, and uniformly suppress the grade for purchase when there are many farmers selling grain. According to the statistics of the team's report, in the purchase of grain, lower-grade yellow rice accounted for 97.4 percent, medium-grade only accounted for 2.6 percent, and there was no upper-grade at all. Farmers in the first district said: "This year's grain has not been damaged by insects or lodging, but the purchase team still thinks it is not up to standard, and no good grain can be collected in the whole district." There are also individual purchase cadres who "say different things to different people" when controlling prices, causing farmers' dissatisfaction. In some areas, the grading is too much and too complicated. In addition to the three grades of upper, middle and lower grades of yellow rice stipulated by the county, the sixth district also divides "inferior grade." At the same time, in the adjacent areas of each district, market, and town, the "grading and pricing" is not uniform. The same quality is divided into different grades due to different regions, which affects the mood of farmers to sell grain. In addition, the procedures in some areas are still not simplified enough, the management of the grain market is not well done, and the "assembly line operation method for purchase" has not been well promoted. For example, the purchase in Guanyin, Yuebo and other places is still crowded, and some farmers have waited for a long time but the grain has not been sold. In some areas, the purchase team has not even set up tea, and the service to the grain-selling farmers is not adequate. In addition, in a few townships and markets, because no purchase team has been established, private merchants take the opportunity to lower prices for purchase. For example, in Wanli, the fifteenth district, when new rice came on the market, each sheng (equivalent to 4.5 jin) was only 2,000 yuan, which was 48 percent lower than the listed price. However, the market management personnel complained that no purchase team was set up there.

    4. Some district party and government organs did not pay attention to this year's autumn purchase work. For example, some districts were afraid of repeating the mistake of forced purchase last year, and this year they did not even dare to publicize the political significance of the autumn purchase to farmers. When problems occurred in the purchase or when the grain and cooperation departments had disputes in signing agency purchase contracts, when they asked the district finance and economics team to solve the problem, the district finance and economics team said: "This is a business issue, you can solve it yourself." In many areas, a blindly optimistic and laissez-faire state has formed in the purchase.

    In addition, because the purchase of grain this year started more than last year, the preparation of storage capacity is not enough. The key to solving this problem is to accurately plan the local sales volume for the whole year, reserve enough grain for supply, and vigorously organize the transfer to avoid losses caused by the reverse transfer of grain. At the same time, we must fully rely on the local district and township administration to rent spacious empty houses such as private warehouses and temples for stacking, but we should pay attention to inspection and storage.

    The above-mentioned problems have aroused the serious attention of the County Finance and Economics Committee, and effective measures are being taken to improve them. The County Grain Company has accurately compiled the purchase and grain use plan for September based on the purchase situation in August, and convened a meeting of the grain directors of each district to specifically study the problems in the purchase. The County Cooperative also convened a meeting of grassroots cooperative directors at the end of August to discuss the supply of materials after the autumn. In the future, we must strengthen the leadership of the party and government organs over the autumn grain purchase, and strengthen the close connection between the various units, in order to complete the major task of purchasing autumn grain this year.

    宜宾县收购秋粮的经验和急待解决的问题
       胡文英
    四川省宜宾县今年收购秋粮工作，由于在县财政经济委员会统一领导下，粮食公司充分依靠合作社，并吸取了去年收购粮食工作的经验，因而收购工作获得了成绩，八月份超额完成月收购计划百分之一百一十九点五。
    去年，宜宾县收购粮食工作开始较迟，少数地区因粮食公司未及时收购，私商乘机压价，市价低于牌价百分之三十以上，农民损失很大。同时，收购点设得太少，农民卖粮很不方便。全县方圆达四百多里，七十二个场镇，仅设二十三个收购点，有的农民卖粮要挑到六、七十里地才有收购站。收购手续也很麻烦，从验级到付款，要经过很多手续，农民卖一次粮食得耽误半天。在“验级分等”上，验级人员也没有准确掌握，偏高偏低现象时有发生。粮食公司为了完成收购任务，甚至还有强迫农民卖粮的情形，致使农民对政府收购政策发生怀疑，从而产生了惜售思想。
    今年宜宾县在开始秋粮收购工作前，该县财政经济委员会为改进上述缺点，召集了粮食部门和合作社共同研究今年收购任务，制定了收购计划。粮食部门和合作社为了搞好相互关系，双方达成了代购与接收的协议，在代购、联购手续和人员组织方面都作了具体的安排。收购点也由去年的二十三个增至四十五个，全县不足三十里的地区即有一个收购点，农民出售粮食很便利。收购手续也尽量做到简化，并吸取今年收购小麦的经验，实行了“收购流水作业法”，将收购小麦时的五道手续简化为三道，原收购时需四、五人，现只需三人，每小时可收四千斤，提高了工作效率百分之三十，并且还防止了“重秤”、“掉谷”、“改据”等现象发生。在贯彻“分等论价”政策上，各收购点都设置了黄谷等级样品，便利农民根据样品核对自己的粮食等级，减少了验级的偏差和争执。在拨款方面，为了作到“用款及时、防止脱购”，除银行部门根据粮食公司“五日用款计划”组织现金调拨外，同时，粮食、银行、税务三个部门还密切联系，交换用款方法，加速资金调拨，在没有设银行的地区，收购点可凭粮食公司的用款单据向税务部门取款，税务部门亦可凭粮食公司用款单据向银行上解，避免现金的相向领运和在途中耽搁。此外，粮食部门和合作社的收购干部，在区财经小组领导下，向农民进行了秋粮收购的宣传，加强对农民的教育，使农民了解出售余粮是进一步巩固工农联盟、支援城市、发展城乡贸易的爱国行动，从而自愿将余粮卖给国家，避免了去年秋粮收购工作中“强迫命令”、“平均摊派”、“挨户搜购”的错误。
    八月初，新谷登场，由于采取了以上措施，农民卖粮很踊跃，但也产生了一连串新的并且急待解决的问题：
      一、收购计划偏小，远赶不上农民售粮的要求。八月份虽超额完成计划一倍余，但在用款上共追补和调整了四次计划，九月份收购资金已提前用了百分之八十四点六，造成银行在资金调拨上的困难，双石、观音等收购站还因资金不足造成“脱购”现象。粮食部门收购计划偏小的原因，是对今年水稻增产和秋收提早、以及农民对生产资料和生活资料要求普遍提高的新情况估计不足，因此，九、十月份必须根据实际情况，重新追编计划，这是一个极重要的问题，应切实加以注意。
    二、有关部门配合秋购的物资供应做得不够好。目前粮食公司在全县投放数额很大，有关单位没有很好地准备货源，组织回笼，生产资料和生活资料不能满足农民需要。如永兴、白花合作社的食盐、十六区的农具（如箩筐、晒垫）、蕨溪百货商店的棉纱都曾脱销，其他地区的布匹、电池、枯肥等也有供应不及时的情况。有许多农民是为了购买自己急需要的生产、生活资料而卖出黄谷的，由于买不到自己所需要的东西，便将黄谷挑回去，影响了农民卖粮的积极性。造成物资供应不足的主要原因是：国营贸易和合作社对新谷上市后，农民购买力显著提高估计不足，同时“怕积压、不怕脱销”“宁脱销、不积压”的错误思想还严重存在，因此不经常保持合理库存，而是随销随进，这种对市场不负责任的经营作风应该迅速改进的。
    三、粮食部门与合作社干部对今年收购秋粮的政治意义还认识不足，不明白收购秋粮是保护农民利益，巩固工农联盟、支援城市建设的具体工作。粮食公司干部存在“任务重、怕完不成”的思想，合作社干部在执行代购与联购业务上，认为
  “利益小、麻烦多”，如徐家、白马等地合作社开始时就不愿和粮食公司订立代购合同。有的收购干部不照顾农民小农经济的特点，不根据农民的习惯与要求，片面执行所谓“办公作息”制度。农民从很远地区挑来粮食，而收购干部认为“时间已过”或“时间未到”而拒绝收购。如十四区一个农民从二十余里路外挑来粮食，因时间迟了，收购干部却说：“今天不收，明天再挑来。”真溪乡合作社在逢场天才收粮，“闲”天便不收。在检验品质上，有的收购干部认为：今年粮价高，农民卖粮多，有“宁高毋低”、抬高品质收购的偏向，而另一方面，如孔滩收购组在农民卖粮人少时便验级分等，卖粮人多时便一律压级收购，根据该组报表统计，在购粮中，下等黄谷占百分之九十七点四，中等仅占百分之二点六，上等却一斤也没有。第一区农民说：“今年谷子一未遭虫害，二未倒伏，收购组还认为不够标准，全区便收不到什么好谷了。”也有个别收购干部在掌握价格时有“看人回话”的情况，引起农民不满；有的地区分等过多过繁，第六区在县规定的黄谷分为上、中、下三个等级外，还分“劣等”。同时，在各区、场、镇毗邻地区，“分等论价”不一，同一品质因地区不同，而分等不同，影响农民卖粮情绪。此外，有的地区手续仍不够简化，加强粮食市场管理作得不好，“收购流水作业法”没有很好推广，如观音、月波等地收购中仍然拥挤，有的农民等了半天而粮食仍未卖出，有的地区收购组连茶水也未设置，对售粮农民服务不周，另外，有少数乡、场因未设立收购组，私商乘机压价收购。如十五区万里在新米上市时，每升
  （合市斤四斤半）仅二千元，低于牌价百分之四十八。而市场管理人员却埋怨当地未设收购组。
    四、有的区党、政机关对今年秋购工作没有重视，如有的区怕再犯去年强迫收购的毛病，今年甚至不敢对农民进行秋购的政治意义的宣传，在收购中出了问题或在订立代购合同，粮食与合作部门双方发生争执，找区财经小组解决时，而区财经小组却说：“这是业务问题，你们自己解决。”不少地区在收购中，形成盲目乐观和自流的状态。
    此外，由于今年收购粮食一开始便比去年多，在仓容上准备不够。解决这一问题的关键在于精确计划全年当地销量，储备足够粮食以备供应，再大力组织调运，以免造成粮食倒运的损失。同时，必须充分依靠当地区、乡行政，租借民仓、庙宇等宽敞空屋堆积，但应注意检查与保管。
    上述存在问题，已引起县财政经济委员会的严重注意，正采取有效措施予以改进。县粮食公司已根据八月份收购情况，较精确地编制九月份收购与用谷计划，并召集各区粮食主任开会专门研究收购中的问题，县合作社于八月底亦召开了基层社主任会议，讨论了秋后物资供应工作。今后必须加强党、政机关对收购秋粮的领导，加强各单位间的密切联系，以完成今年收购秋粮的重大任务。
