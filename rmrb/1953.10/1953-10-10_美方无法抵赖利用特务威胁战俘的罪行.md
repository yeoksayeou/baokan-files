Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th—Our special correspondent Wu Min reports: While hypocritically talking about prisoners of war having "freedom of choice" on the repatriation issue, the U.S. side sent a large number of special agents into the neutral nations repatriation committee’s custodial camps, intensifying the reign of terror against the prisoners of war, coercing them not to request repatriation. This behavior of the U.S. side completely violates the provisions of the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission."

At the Military Armistice Commission meeting held on the 7th, Chief Korean-Chinese member Li Sang-cho severely warned the U.S. side that it must immediately stop this conspiracy of sending special agents to undermine the custodial work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and using violence to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war, and declared that the U.S. side must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom. U.S. member Brian tried his best at the meeting to deny the solemn accusations made by our side, and vaguely stated that "only" personnel needed by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission were sent to the prisoner of war camps. Brian pretended to be nonchalant, as if the fact that U.S. agents were coercing and persecuting prisoners of war did not exist in the prisoner of war camps.

However, the notorious crimes of U.S. agents are already known to the world, and any denial by the U.S. side is just a clumsy attempt to cover up the truth.

The brutal rule of U.S. agents in prisoner of war camps has now shocked even the representatives of neutral countries. In a statement issued on October 2 regarding the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, composed of five neutral nations, India, Sweden, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, it affirmed that prisoners of war were under great pressure. General Thimayya has also repeatedly pointed out that prisoners of war are under the threat of force. At the same time, Indian newspapers have also exposed the violent rule of U.S. agents over prisoners of war in camps guarded by Indian troops.

According to the statements of our captured personnel who have returned after repatriation, the prisoner of war camps under the rule of special agents are a scene of hell, which cannot but make everyone with a little conscience feel angry. More than one hundred and ten Korean-Chinese captured personnel who returned successively after breaking through the control of special agents before the explanation work began, unanimously accused U.S. agents of inflicting appalling physical and mental coercion on prisoners of war. Prisoners of war were beaten, abused, and forcibly tattooed for expressing their desire to be repatriated. Many prisoners of war were tortured to death by cutting flesh, gouging out hearts, and other unimaginable tortures for insisting on repatriation. These returnees provided a large amount of conclusive evidence. The facts they revealed proved that after the transfer of prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the U.S. agents not only maintained the original organizational form of controlling prisoners of war but also continued to do what they had done in the past in Jeju Island, Geoje Island, and other U.S. prisoner of war camps: torturing and killing prisoners of war to prevent repatriation. The special agents forced prisoners of war to sign joint guarantee systems, forced them to attend "lectures" by the special agents, and participate in "exercises" to sabotage the explanation work. The bloody tears of our returnees and the scars, wounds, and tattoos on their bodies prove to what extent the right of prisoners of war to be repatriated, which the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" stipulates must be respected, has been trampled upon under the reign of terror of U.S. agents.

The ugly facts that have been exposed show that no matter how the U.S. side denies it, it is the U.S. authorities that are undermining the agreement on the prisoner of war issue in the armistice agreement and directing and instigating a large number of special agents to inflict inhuman abuse on prisoners of war to prevent them from requesting repatriation.

### 美方无法抵赖利用特务威胁战俘的罪行

    美方无法抵赖利用特务威胁战俘的罪行
    【新华社开城九日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：美方一面伪善地谈论着战俘在遣返问题上有“选择的自由”，一面却派遣大批特务分子混入中立国遣返委员会看管营场，变本加厉地对战俘们实行恐怖统治，胁迫他们不得要求遣返。美方的这种行径完全违反了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定。
    朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在七日举行的军事停战委员会会议上，严厉警告美方必须立即停止这种派遣特务破坏中立国遣返委员会的看管工作和以暴力阻挠战俘遣返的阴谋活动，并声明美方必须对由此而引起的一切后果负完全责任。美方委员勃里安在会上竭力抵赖我方所提出的严正指责，支吾其词地表示“只有”中立国遣返委员会所需要的人员才被派到战俘营场里去。勃里安装作若无其事的样子，好像战俘营中并不存在着美方特务威逼和迫害战俘的事实。
    但是，美方特务的声名狼藉的罪行已经是举世周知的了，美方的任何否认只是欲盖弥彰而已。
    美方特务在战俘营中实行的残暴统治，现在连中立国家的代表都不能不感到震惊。由印度、瑞典、瑞士、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰五个中立国家组成的中立国遣返委员会在十月二日发表的关于该委员会工作情况的声明中肯定战俘受到很大压力。蒂迈雅中将也一再指出战俘处在武力的威胁之下。与此同时，印度报纸也揭发了美方特务在印度部队看管的营场中对战俘们进行暴力统治。
    根据遣返归来的我方被俘人员的陈述，特务统治下的战俘营中是一片地狱景象，每一个稍有良心的人对此都不能不感到愤怒。在解释工作开始以前突破特务控制陆续归来的一百一十多名朝中被俘人员，一致控诉美方特务对战俘们施行骇人听闻的肉体的残害和精神上的威逼。战俘们由于流露了要求遣返的愿望而遭到特务们的殴打、虐待和强迫刺字，许多战俘由于坚持遣返，受到割肉、挖心以及其他种种难以想像的酷刑残害致死。这些归来人员提供了大量的确凿不移的罪证。他们揭露的事实证明，美方特务在战俘移交中立国遣返委员会看管之后，不但保持着原有的控制战俘的组织形式并且继续干着他们过去在济州岛、巨济岛和其他美方战俘营中所干的虐杀战俘以阻止遣返的勾当。特务们强迫战俘订立连环保，强迫他们去听特务的“讲课”
  并参加破坏解释工作的“演习”。我方归来人员的血泪控诉和他们身上的伤疤、伤口和刺字，证明了在美方特务的恐怖统治下，“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”规定必须予以尊重的战俘被遣返的权
  利，已经被蹂躏到什么程度。
      已经暴露出来的丑恶事实说明：不管美方怎样
  矢口抵赖，破坏停战协定中关于战俘问题的协议、
  指挥和策动大批特务对战俘进行非人的虐待以阻止
  他们要求遣返的，正是美方当局。
