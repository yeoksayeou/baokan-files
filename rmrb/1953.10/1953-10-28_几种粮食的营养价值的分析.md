Analysis of the Nutritional Value of Several Grains
Shen Qizhen, President of the Central Institute of Hygiene

The normal development and health of the human body depend on food to provide sufficient and appropriate materials. The daily consumption of various cells needs to be replenished by food. Therefore, the selection of food, especially staple food—grains, should be based on the principle of being beneficial to human nutrition. However, there is a relatively common habit in our lives, that is, people love to eat refined grains and do not like to eat coarse grains, and regard eating refined white rice and refined white flour as the main requirement for improving life. In fact, this is unscientific. Eating only refined grains and not coarse grains, especially only eating refined white rice and refined white flour, will cause the occurrence of certain nutritional deficiencies, which is very harmful to people's health.

Grain is the main food providing heat energy in the diet. In China, it is generally customary to use grains as the staple food. The heat energy provided by various grains is roughly the same, but the nutrients they contain are significantly different. For example, rice does not contain carotene at all, while other miscellaneous grains contain carotene to a greater or lesser extent; millet contains more thiamine and riboflavin than other miscellaneous grains; all grains except fresh corn do not contain ascorbic acid; brown rice contains the most nicotinic acid; other nutrients such as protein, calcium, phosphorus, and iron also vary significantly among various grains. According to the analysis of food composition (see the table below), it can be affirmed that the nutritional value of coarse grains is generally higher than that of refined grains. (Attached table)

As for refined white rice and refined white flour, they have suffered serious losses of nutrients due to excessive processing. Because the germ and aleurone layer of grains contain much more nutrients than the endosperm, excessive processing will cause most or all of the germ and aleurone layer to be lost. Therefore, the higher the processing accuracy of rice and flour, the lower its nutritional value. Someone once conducted an experiment to prove that the content of several major vitamins in brown rice was lost after each milling during the three milling processes. (Attached table)

The above table shows that after three milling processes, thiamine loss reaches 80.9%, riboflavin loss reaches 60.6%, and nicotinic acid loss reaches 70.3%.

If the human body lacks necessary nutrients, the result will be nutritional deficiencies. However, many people think that diseases caused by malnutrition are chronic and not terrible. Therefore, the choice of grain varieties is based only on palatability, not on the amount of nutrients. This is incorrect. The diseases caused by the lack of several major nutrients are described as follows:

(1) When vitamin A (carotene can be converted into vitamin A in the body) is lacking, night blindness will occur. This disease does not seem as terrible as other infectious diseases at first glance, but if patients with vitamin A deficiency do not receive appropriate treatment, their eyes may gradually become blind.

(2) When thiamine (vitamin B1) is lacking, it will cause disorders in the patient's nerves, circulation, gastrointestinal tract, and metabolism. Therefore, there will be symptoms of neurasthenia such as loss of appetite, weakness in the lower limbs, reduced vital capacity, general fatigue, indigestion, constipation, insomnia, feeling of heartbeat and irregular heartbeat, or abnormal sensations, and inability to concentrate. Patients often have sensory disturbances in the soles of their feet first, followed by tenderness and cramps (itching) and muscle weakness in the gastrocnemius muscle (calf); then, there will be serious phenomena such as disappearance of the knee-jerk reflex, foot drop, and toe drop, which is the so-called dry beriberi (not athlete's foot). If the heart is involved and circulatory system disorders occur, edema will occur, which is the so-called wet beriberi.

(3) When riboflavin (vitamin B2) is lacking, there will be symptoms of cheilitis (angular cheilitis), lip inflammation (cheilitis), purple-red tongue color, tongue fissures, and enlarged taste buds, as well as seborrheic dermatitis of the scrotum and facial skin. This condition will reduce the body's resistance to other diseases.

(4) When nicotinic acid (niacin) is lacking, the main systems affected are the nervous, skin, and gastrointestinal systems. Severe neurological symptoms can lead to dementia. Skin symptoms include erythema, blisters, scabs, erosion, redness, or thickening, chapping, and pigmentation. Gastrointestinal symptoms are mainly diarrhea, with watery stools mixed with undigested food and a particularly foul odor.

The most important way to prevent nutritional deficiencies is to improve the diet, not to take pure vitamin preparations. According to scientific analysis, taking thiamine as an example, the minimum daily requirement for adults is 1.5 mg. However, refined white rice contains only 0.25 mg of thiamine per catty (approximately 500g); moderately processed white rice contains 1.6 mg per catty. Therefore, if each person eats one catty of moderately processed white rice per day, the thiamine content is sufficient for one day's needs; if they switch to refined white rice, eating 1.5 catties per day will not be enough to meet their needs. As for the nutrients contained in other miscellaneous grains, and the impact of excessive processing on nutrients, details are shown in the two attached tables above. Therefore, in order to promote people's health and normal development, we should advocate eating more coarse grains, and not advocate eating refined white rice and refined white flour. At the same time, doing so has another advantage, which will increase the rice yield and flour yield. According to our estimates, as long as the finished product rate of each 100 catties of grain is increased by two or three catties, the country will increase the production of rice and flour by hundreds of millions of catties every year. Therefore, avoiding excessive grain processing can not only directly improve people's nutrition, but also save a lot of wealth for the country to invest in the country's large-scale economic construction.

In order to improve people's nutrition, in the past year, we have studied the nutritional value of steamed paddy rice and the method of eating a mixture of coarse and refined grains. Experiments have proved that the method of processing rice by steaming paddy, which has been used in China for thousands of years, is very scientific. Rice grains made in this way can not only be stored for a long time, but also because the nutrients in the bran penetrate into the endosperm during the steaming process, the loss of vitamins can be avoided and the rice yield can be increased by 2% during bran removal and milling. The loss of several major vitamins during the three milling processes of steamed paddy rice is as follows: (Attached table)

The above table shows that after three millings of steamed brown rice, the loss of thiamine is only 12.5%, the loss of riboflavin is only 40.3%, and the loss of nicotinic acid is only 26.8%. Compared with the aforementioned ordinary processing method, the steamed paddy rice processing method can greatly reduce the loss of vitamin content.

As for eating a mixture of coarse and refined grains, it will increase the nutrient content of food. General miscellaneous grains such as yellow corn, white corn, sorghum, and millet contain more thiamine and riboflavin than No. 81 flour and No. 92 rice, and millet and yellow corn contain carotene that rice and flour do not have. Although the physiological value of protein in miscellaneous grains is slightly lower than that of rice, the difference is limited, and the protein content of rice is less than that of miscellaneous grains, so eating coarse grains will not affect protein nutrition. If grains and beans are eaten together, due to the complementary effect of proteins, the physiological value of protein in this mixed food can even exceed that of refined grains. For example, the mixed flour commonly used by people in North China has been repeatedly proven to increase the nutritional value of protein when corn and soybeans are mixed. We have conducted experiments with animals, using millet flour, No. 81 flour, and soybean flour to make mixed feed, which proved to promote the growth rate of animals. Therefore, if 90% sorghum rice and flour and 10% soybean flour are mixed to make bread, the protein digestibility can reach 80%. If 50% No. 81 flour is mixed with 50% millet flour (or corn flour) to make steamed buns, the protein content is about twice that of refined white flour steamed buns, and the calcium and iron content is also much higher. A 4.6-liang (approximately 230g) mixed steamed bun contains 0.19 mg of thiamine and 0.07 mg of riboflavin; a 3.5-liang (approximately 175g) refined white flour steamed bun contains 0.01 mg of thiamine and 0.03 mg of riboflavin; a 3.5-liang No. 81 flour steamed bun contains 0.12 mg of thiamine and 0.04 mg of riboflavin. The above facts prove that the nutritional value of mixed steamed buns is not only higher than that of refined white flour steamed buns, but also higher than that of No. 81 flour steamed buns. Therefore, eating a mixture of coarse and refined grains or eating a mixture of coarse grains is completely reasonable.

However, some people have a concern about eating coarse grains, thinking that coarse grains contain more crude fiber and are afraid of affecting the digestion and absorption of food. In fact, general grains contain crude fiber, and crude fiber has the effect of stimulating intestinal peristalsis. Except for barley and corn, which have a high crude fiber content, the crude fiber content of other miscellaneous grains is lower than that of No. 92 rice, so eating miscellaneous grains does not affect digestion.

Some people also think that although the nutrition of coarse grains is good, they are not as tasty as refined white rice and refined white flour. This is because refined white rice and refined white flour have created a conditioned reflex that promotes appetite, so when changing to coarse grains at the beginning, people feel a decrease in appetite. In fact, this is a conditioned reflex that can be changed, and it can be replaced by a new conditioned reflex. Recently, some agencies and units have created many methods of making coarse grains into fine foods, and the foods made from coarse grains are more delicious, more beautiful, and cheaper than the foods made from refined grains, and are very popular among the general public.

In addition, some people think that coarse grains contain more bran and sand particles, which are not as clean as refined grains. This problem is simple. As long as the processing department pays more attention, the impurities contained in coarse grains can be reduced.

In order to realize these methods, we believe that it is necessary to first vigorously publicize among the masses, dispel concerns about eating coarse grains, correct the incorrect view that the whiter and more refined the rice and flour, the higher the nutritional value, and thereby establish correct nutritional concepts, so that people can not only economically but also nutritionally recognize this problem.

    几种粮食的营养价值的分析
    中央卫生研究院院长  沈其震
    人体的正常发育和健康要靠食物来供给充分与适当的材料。各种细胞的日常消耗要靠食物来补充。因此，对于食物，特别是主食品——粮食的选用，应该以有益于人体的营养为原则。但在我们的生活中却有一种比较普遍的习惯，这就是爱吃细粮，不爱吃粗粮，以吃精白米精白面作为改善生活的主要要求。其实，这是不科学的。只吃细粮不吃粗粮，特别是只吃精白米和精白面，将会引起某些营养缺乏症的产生，对于人民健康是非常有害的。
    粮食是膳食中供给热能的主要食品。我国一般习惯以谷类作为主食，各种谷类所能供给的热能大致相等，但其所含营养成分则有显著的差别。例如稻米，是完全不含胡萝卜素的，其他杂粮则都或多或少地含有胡萝卜素；小米所含硫胺素及核黄素，远较其他杂粮为多；所有谷类中除新鲜玉米外均不含抗坏血酸；糙米所含尼克酸最多；其他如蛋白质及钙、磷、铁等含量，各种谷类均有极显著的差别。根据食物成分的分析（详见下表），可以肯定地说，粗粮的营养价值一般均较细粮为高。（附图表）
    至于精白米和精白面，则由于加工过度而造成了营养成分的严重损失。因为谷类胚芽及糊粉层所含营养素较胚乳部分高出甚多，加工过度会使胚芽及糊粉层大部或全部损失，因此米面加工精度愈高，它的营养价值愈低。曾经有人作过一次实验，证明糙米在三次碾磨过程中所含几种主要维生素在每次碾磨后都受到损失。（附图表）
    上表说明，糙米经过三次碾磨后，硫胺素损失达百分之八十点九，核黄素损失达百分之六十点六，尼克酸损失达百分之七十点三。
    人体如缺少必要的某种营养成分，其结果将引起营养缺乏症。但有很多人却认为：营养不良所引起的疾病是慢性的，没有什么可怕。因此对粮食品种的选择，只从可口出发，而不以营养成分多少为原则。这是不正确的。现将几种主要营养成分缺少时所产生的病症分述如下：
    （一）当甲种维生素（胡萝卜素在身体内可以转变为甲种维生素）缺乏的时候，便会发生夜盲症。这种疾病乍看起来不如其他传染病可怕，但如果甲种维生素缺乏的患者得不到适当的治疗，则患者的眼睛可能因此逐渐失明。
    （二）如硫胺素（一号乙种维生素）缺乏的时候，会使病人的神经、循环、肠胃以及新陈代谢方面发生紊乱，因此有食欲不振，下肢无力，肺活量减少，全身疲惫，消化不良、便秘、失眠、自觉心跳且不规律，或感觉异常、思想不能集中等神经衰弱症状。患者多先有足底知觉障碍，腓肠肌（小腿肚）压痛与抽筋（痛痒）及肌肉无力等现象；接着，有膝腱反射消失、足垂病和趾垂病等严重现象发生，这就是所谓干性脚气病（并非脚湿气）。如果心脏受累而发生循环系统障碍时，则有水肿现象发生，就是所谓湿性脚气病。
    （三）核黄素（二号乙种维生素）缺乏的时候，就有烂口角（口角炎）、烂口唇（唇炎）、舌色紫红、舌面裂隙和味蕾肥大等舌炎症状及阴囊与颜面皮肤的溢脂性皮炎等现象发生，这种病象会减低身体对其他疾病的抵抗力。
    （四）尼克酸（菸硷酸）缺乏时，主要是神经、皮肤、肠胃系统发生紊乱，神经症状严重的会使人发生痴呆，皮肤症状中会有红斑、水疱、结痂、糜烂发红、或肥厚、皴裂及色素沉着等。肠胃症状则主要是腹泻，粪便像水，混有未被消化的食物，气味特臭。
    对营养缺乏症的预防方法，最主要的是改善膳食，而不是服用纯维生素制剂。根据科学的分析，现以硫胺素一项为例，成人每天最低需要量为一点五毫克。但精白米每斤中所含的硫胺素只有零点二五毫克；而加工适度的白米，每斤可含一点六毫克。因此，如每人每天吃加工适度的白米一斤，其中所含硫胺素则足够一天的需要；如果改吃精白米，则每人每天吃一斤半还不够其需要量。至于其他各种杂粮所含营养成分，以及过度加工对营养成分的影响，详情已见以上两个附表。所以，为了促进人民的健康和正常发育，我们应该提倡多吃粗粮，而不提倡吃精白米和精白面。同时，这样做还有另一个好处，它将会提高出米率和出粉率。根据我们的估计，每百斤粮食只要提高两三斤成品率，全国每年就会增产米面十数亿斤。因此，尽量避免粮食过度加工，不仅可以直接改善人民的营养情况，而且还可以为国家节省大量财富，以投入祖国的大规模经济建设。
    为了改进人民的营养情况，在最近一年中，我们曾经研究了蒸谷米的营养价值以及粗细粮混合食用等方法。实验证明，我国数千年来沿用的蒸谷加工制米方法，是非常合乎科学的。用这种方法制成的米粒，不仅可以经久储藏，而且由于在蒸谷过程中，糠皮中的营养素浸入胚乳，因而在去糠和碾磨的过程中，不仅可以避免维生素的损失，而且可以提高出米率百分之二。蒸谷米在三次碾磨过程中所含几种主要维生素的损失情况如次：（附图表）
    上表说明蒸谷糙米经过三次碾磨后，硫胺素的损失仅达百分之十二点五，核黄素损失仅达百分之四十点三，尼克酸损失仅达百分之二十六点八。如与前述普通加工方法相较，蒸谷制米方法可以大大地减少维生素含量的损失。
    至于粗粮细粮混合食用，是会提高食物营养成分的含量的。一般的杂粮如黄玉米、白玉米、高粱、小米等，其所含硫胺素和核黄素都超过八一粉和九二米，而小米与黄玉米中更含有米面所没有的胡萝卜素。虽然杂粮蛋白质的生理价值比大米稍低，但相差有限，而且大米蛋白质含量比杂粮少，所以食用粗粮在蛋白质营养上不致发生什么影响。如以谷类与豆类混合食用，由于蛋白质的互补作用，这种混合食物蛋白质的生理价值甚至可以超过细粮。例如华北地区人民习用的杂合面，曾经多次实验证明其玉米和黄豆配制的方法能使蛋白质的营养价值增高。我们曾用动物作实验，即以小米面、八一面、黄豆粉作成混合饲料，证明可以促进动物的生长率。因此，如以高粱米面百分之九十与大豆面百分之十混合作成面包，其蛋白质消化率可达百分之八十。如以八一面百分之五十与小米面（或玉米面）百分之五十混合作成馒头，则蛋白质含量约为精白面馒头的两倍，而且钙和铁的含量也超过很多。四两六钱重的混合馒头含硫胺素零点一九毫克，核黄素零点零七毫克；三两五钱重的精白面馒头含硫胺素零点零一毫克，核黄素零点零三毫克；三两五钱重的八一粉馒头含硫胺素零点一二毫克，核黄素零点零四毫克。以上事实证明：混合馒头营养价值不仅比精白面馒头高，而且比八一面馒头高。因此粗细粮混合食用或粗粮混合食用是完全合理的。
    但有人对吃粗粮有一种顾虑，以为粗粮含粗纤维较多，怕影响食物的消化吸收。其实，一般粮食均含有粗纤维，粗纤维有刺激肠蠕动的作用。粮食中除大麦和玉米的粗纤维含量较高外，其他杂粮的粗纤维含量都比九二米低，因此食用杂粮并不影响消化。
    还有人认为，粗粮的营养虽然好，但不如精白米精白面好吃。这是由于精白米精白面已经造成了一种促进食欲的条件反射，所以当改食粗粮之初，感到食欲减低。其实，这是一种可以改变的条件反射，是可以用新的条件反射来代替它的。最近有些机关单位创造了许多粗粮细作的方法，用粗粮制出的食品比细粮制出的食品更好吃、更好看，而且价格便宜，很受一般人欢迎。
    此外，还有人认为，粗粮中含有谷皮、砂粒比较多，不如细粮干净。这个问题很简单，只要加工部门多加注意，粗粮中所含杂质就可以减少。
    为了要实现这些办法，我们认为必须首先在群众中大力展开宣传，打消食用粗粮的顾虑，纠正对于米面愈白愈精营养价值愈高的不正确的看法，从而树立正确的营养观点，使人民不仅从经济上而且从营养上认识这个问题。
