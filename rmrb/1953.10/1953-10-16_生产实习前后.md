Before and After Production Internship
　　Yang Yinmei
　　This summer vacation, a total of 106 students from the first year of the Electrical Engineering Department's Power Generation Specialization, the first year of the Power Machinery Department's Thermal Power Equipment Specialization, and the second year of undergraduate studies at Tsinghua University went to a power plant construction site in the Central and Southern District for their first production internship. Most of us participated in production labor as ordinary workers, assigned to more than ten different types of work crews; a small number of students also served as apprentice technicians. Because we participated in labor relatively deeply, the students gained a lot in terms of professional skills and understanding; and the students' enthusiasm for labor also inspired the worker comrades on the construction site. The students' spirit of hard work, endurance, and serious study was praised by the factory leadership and worker comrades.
　　Before arriving at the construction site, the students majoring in thermal power equipment thought that a boiler was simply a pot and a furnace; while the students majoring in power generation did not know what was in a power plant, and could not even distinguish between oil switches and transformers. However, after more than twenty days of internship, almost every student could eloquently tell you the entire production process and main systems of a power plant; they could also tell you how the part of the project they participated in was installed, as well as the technical and organizational issues in the installation. One student said: "Now I have a clear understanding, and I won't feel abstract when I study issues related to power plants in the future." In short, this internship not only consolidated the theoretical courses we have already learned, but also laid the foundation for future professional courses.
　　I remember that when the thermal power equipment specialization was divided into professional groups, some students thought that studying steam turbines was good because it was "clean" and the "theory was profound"; while boilers were "not machines, just a pot and a furnace, there is nothing to learn." Therefore, many students were willing to study steam turbines but not boilers. After visiting the factory, they changed their previous views. They realized that in a modern power plant, the boiler is extremely important, it is not just a pot and a furnace, but has extremely complex automatic control devices.
　　During this internship, everyone realized the importance of linking theory with practice, and deeply felt that to make a practical engineering design, a high level of technical and ideological understanding is needed; and to turn the design into reality requires even more outstanding construction technology. Therefore, a new type of technical cadre not only needs to master basic knowledge and professional theoretical knowledge, but also needs to be familiar with the actual production on site, have the viewpoint of relying on workers and linking with reality, and have the organizational ability to lead on-site production.
　　The working spirit of the Soviet experts gave the students a great education. Someone asked a Soviet expert: "Can the electric light on the design drawing be modified?" The expert's answer was: "The wires can be modified, but the position and angle of the light must not be changed." This means that an engineer must not only ensure the progress and quality of the project in the design, but also consider the safety of operation and the health of the workers. The idea of wholeheartedly serving the working class, and always caring about the lives and welfare of the workers, runs through the entire project designed by the expert. Whether in the roaring boiler room or the outdoor substation, the Soviet experts patiently and seriously guided the work all day long, explaining to everyone again and again. If you didn't understand, he would do it himself to show you.
　　During the internship, we saw that when installing electric wires, the joints must be completely smooth, and the gap cannot exceed 0.05 mm; and the operating lines in the main control room are no less than several thousand, and when connected to the electric board, each one must go through seven or eight procedures. If one is connected incorrectly, it may affect the entire factory. The worker comrades are carrying out this same vast and arduous labor. From this, we also realized the meaning of the saying "big things are accumulated from small things." Without such small and vast labor, the design drawings are ultimately just drawings. This requires a strong will, a high sense of responsibility for work, and creative labor.

    生产实习前后
    杨吟梅
    今年暑假，清华大学电机系发电专修科一年级、动力机械系热力发电设备专修科一年级及本科二年级同学共一百零六人到中南区某发电厂工地进行了第一次生产实习。我们大多数是以普通工人的身分，编入不同工种的十余个班参加生产劳动；少数同学并担任了见习技术员的工作。由于我们比较深入地参加了劳动，同学们在业务上和认识上有了很大的收获；而同学们的劳动热情也鼓舞了工地上的工人同志。同学们刻苦耐劳和认真学习的精神，受到了工厂领导方面和工人同志的赞扬。
    到工地以前，热力发电设备专修科的同学以为，锅炉就是简单的一个锅和一个炉；而发电专修科的同学，不懂得发电厂里有些什么东西，甚至分不清油开关和变压器。但是经过了二十多天的实习，几乎每个同学都能滔滔不绝地向你讲出一个发电厂的全部生产过程、主要系统等等；还会告诉你他所参加的那部分工程是如何安装起来的，以及安装中的技术、组织等问题。一个同学说：“现在心中有数了，以后学习有关发电厂的问题就不会觉得抽象了。”总之，这次实习不仅巩固了已学过的理论课，并为今后学习专业课打下了基础。
    记得热力发电设备专修科在分专业组的时候，有些同学认为，学汽机好，既“干净”，“理论又高深”；而锅炉呢，“不是机器，只不过是一个锅一个炉罢了，没什么可学的”。因此，很多同学都愿意学汽机而不愿意学锅炉。他们参观了工厂以后，改变了以前的看法。他们认识到，在一个近代化的发电厂中，锅炉是极为重要的，它并不只是一个锅一个炉，有着极为复杂的自动控制装置。
    在这次实习中，大家体会了理论联系实际的重要性，深切感到要作出一个切合实际的工程设计，需要高度的技术水平和思想水平；把设计变成现实，更需要卓越的施工技术。因此一个新型的技术干部，不仅需要掌握基础知识、专业理论知识，而且要熟悉现场的生产实际，具有依靠工人、联系实际的观点和领导现场生产的组织能力。
    苏联专家的工作精神给予同学们很大的教育。有人问苏联专家：“设计图纸上的电灯是否可以改装一下？”专家的回答是：“电线可以改装，但灯的位置和角度决不能改变。”这就是说，一个工程师在设计中不仅要保证工程的进度、质量，还要考虑到操作的安全和工人的健康。全心全意为工人阶级服务，时刻关心工人的生活和福利的思想，贯穿在专家所设计的整个工程中。不论在轰轰作响的锅炉房或是户外的变电站，苏联专家终日耐心而严肃地指导着工作，一遍两遍地给大家讲解，如果你听不懂，他就亲自动手作给你看。
    在实习中我们看到：在安装电线时，接头处必须完全平滑，间隙不能超过零点零五粍；而主控制室的操作线不下几千根，接到电板上时，每一根都要经过七八道程序，接错了一根，就可能影响到整个的工厂。工人同志们就是这样地进行着这同一的浩繁的劳动。从这里我们也体会了“大事情是由小事情积累起来的”这句话的意义，如果没有那么细小而浩繁的劳动，那末设计图纸终是图纸。这就需要坚强的意志，需要对工作的高度责任感和创造性的劳动。
