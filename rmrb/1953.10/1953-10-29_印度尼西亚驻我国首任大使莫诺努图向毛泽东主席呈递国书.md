Ambassador Mononutu's eulogy:
Your Excellency,

It is a great honor for me today to present to Your Excellency the Letter of Credence from the President and Government of the Republic of Indonesia appointing me as the first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Indonesia in the People's Republic of China.

The closest relationship between the peoples of Indonesia and China, so concretely demonstrated over centuries, has laid a solid foundation for the most sincere cooperation. In particular, the great commonality that both of our peoples have been liberated in modern times through mass revolutions will undoubtedly lay a solid foundation for understanding, goodwill, and cooperation.

Both of our countries have inherited a rich legacy of ancient cultures. But the new era has brought us new obligations to the peoples of both countries and other countries in the world, and by adapting to this new era, the relationship between our two countries has been further strengthened.

History presents our two peoples with a great task of construction, a huge work of reconstruction, which further strengthens our sincerity for world peace and our desire to develop relations in all aspects, especially economic aspects.

In this regard, the scope of cooperation between our two countries in developing our resources and developing national construction is broad.

Therefore, I am confident that with Your Excellency's support and the cooperation of officials of your government, my mission will be successful, and that such support and cooperation will prove our common desire to strengthen the ties of friendship between our two countries, especially in the economic and commercial fields.

Please allow me to convey the sincere wishes of the President, Government, and people of the Republic of Indonesia to Your Excellency for health and happiness, and to wish the good Chinese people peace and prosperity.

Chairman Mao Zedong's reply:
Your Excellency Ambassador,

I am very pleased to accept the Letter of Credence presented by Your Excellency the Ambassador from the President of the Republic of Indonesia, and I express my deep gratitude for the congratulations conveyed by Your Excellency the Ambassador from the President, Government, and people of the Republic of Indonesia.

The long-standing friendship between the peoples of China and Indonesia has been further developed in the three years since the establishment of new diplomatic relations between our two countries. I believe that in the future, with the efforts of Your Excellency the Ambassador, the friendly cooperative relations in economy and culture between China and Indonesia will become increasingly close, and that the enhancement of this friendly relationship will contribute to the peace of Asia and the world for which the peoples of all countries are striving.

I warmly welcome Your Excellency to serve the People's Republic of China as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Indonesia, and in the work of Your Excellency the Ambassador to strengthen friendly cooperation between the two countries, you will receive the assistance of myself and the Government of the People's Republic of China.

I wish Your Excellency success in your work.
