Xinhua News Agency, October 13th:

    The National Higher Normal Education Conference convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government concluded on the 13th. This is the first conference dedicated to the study of higher normal education since liberation. The conference clarified the important position of higher normal education in national construction, defined the development guidelines and tasks for higher normal schools for the next five years, clarified the requirements and methods for teaching reform, and revised the teaching plans for eight major specialties in higher normal schools, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, education, geography, history, and Chinese language and literature, specifying the implementation steps and methods for training teachers.

    The conference heard Minister of Education Zhang Xiruo's report on "The Basic Situation of National Higher Normal Education and Future Guidelines and Tasks," Vice Minister Liu Shi's report on "Teaching Reform in Higher Normal Schools," and Deputy Director of the Higher Normal Education Department Li Shi's report on "The Revision Process of Teaching Plans for Higher Normal Schools." During the conference, Deputy Director of the Culture and Education Committee of the Central People's Government, Xi Zhongxun, and Secretary-General Qian Junrui, both attended and delivered speeches, in which they gave important instructions on major issues such as the important position of higher normal education in national construction, the guidelines and tasks for higher normal education in the next five years, strengthening the leadership of schools, and political work in schools. The conference also invited Soviet expert Professor Chuikov to systematically introduce the experience of Soviet higher normal education. The representatives conducted in-depth and detailed discussions on the aforementioned reports. At the closing of the conference, Vice Minister of Education Dong Chuncai delivered a summary report.

    This conference, based on the general line and general policy of our country's gradual transition to a socialist society, and the task of the people's education undertaking to correspondingly cultivate construction talents for the country and gradually improve the people's cultural level, determined the important position of higher normal education in national construction and educational construction. The conference pointed out that in response to the needs of national construction, especially the needs of national industrialization, the focus of current educational construction is to develop higher education institutions to cultivate advanced specialized construction talents. To develop higher education institutions, it is necessary to develop secondary schools; to develop secondary schools, it is necessary to develop higher normal schools that train teachers for secondary schools. Therefore, higher normal schools and higher industrial schools have become important links in educational work for cultivating talents. At the same time, in order to appropriately meet the people's demands for elementary education, it is necessary to correspondingly develop secondary normal schools, and higher normal schools are responsible for training teachers for secondary normal schools. The conference pointed out: the quality and quantity of higher normal schools directly affect the quality and quantity of secondary schools, and indirectly affect the state's plan for cultivating construction cadres. Therefore, higher normal education is the focus of the entire general education and is the key to running and developing all educational work well. In the past four years, higher normal education has undergone rapid restoration and has greatly developed. It has also carried out a series of preliminary reform work such as opening doors to workers and peasants, ideological remoulding, departmental adjustments, and teaching reform, and has achieved successes. However, the foundation of higher normal schools inherited from the old China is very poor. At present, the number of higher normal schools is far from meeting the needs of the country and the people. The first five-year plan requires the supplement of about 100,000 secondary school teachers, and nearly 30,000 secondary school teachers need to be supplemented in the next year alone. Higher normal schools can only supply about 70,000 people in five years, excluding short-term training. The quality also needs to be greatly improved.

    Based on the above situation, the conference determined that the guideline for higher normal education in the next few years is "to vigorously develop higher normal education in a planned and prepared manner on the basis of consolidating and rectifying the existing higher normal education, according to needs and possibilities." This means paying attention to both needs and possibilities; paying attention to both improving quality and developing quantity. The conference also decided that in the next five years, the first step is to gradually expand the scale of the original higher normal schools with better conditions, and the second step is to build some new higher normal schools with conditions and preparations. The conference pointed out that from the Ministry of Education to local education administrative departments and schools at all levels, they should formulate development plans in the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and prevent two kinds of ideological deviations: one is the impetuous mood of only considering needs and ignoring conditions, and the other is only considering current conditions, failing to see the conditions that can be created, only considering the local and ignoring the overall, and unilaterally emphasizing quality while ignoring the current realistic needs. In order to solve the realistic problem of the large shortage of secondary school teachers in the next few years, in addition to the current higher normal school system (four years of study for undergraduate courses and two years for specialized courses) remaining unchanged, it is also necessary to adopt various temporary transitional measures to train secondary school teachers: such as graduating undergraduate students one year in advance; selecting some outstanding graduates from specialized courses to work as senior high school teachers; and running training courses to train selected junior high school teachers to become senior high school teachers. The need for teachers in junior secondary schools is even greater. In addition to expanding the enrollment of normal junior colleges and specialized courses attached to normal colleges, teachers in elementary schools can also be transferred and trained, and normal school graduates can be trained in short-term courses to supplement the shortage of existing teachers. In addition, comprehensive universities, higher sports schools, and higher art schools are required to cultivate some teachers in liberal arts, sports, music, art, and other fields for secondary schools.

    The conference also focused on discussing the issue of learning from the Soviet Union to carry out teaching reform. The conference believes that teaching reform must learn from the Soviet Union, and the advanced scientific achievements of the Soviet Union should be humbly understood and accepted. The paths and specific practices that the Soviet Union has experienced should be carefully analyzed and studied as important references in work. Under the current circumstances, teaching reform is the central link in running or improving higher normal education. Teaching reform is the central link in the transformation of higher normal education during the transition period. All schools should be good at mobilizing, organizing, and leading teachers to actively participate in teaching reform, so that teachers can transform their teaching ideas, absorb advanced scientific knowledge, and improve teaching methods in the process of teaching reform, thereby improving the quality of teaching. The conference requested that within the first five-year plan, efforts must be made to formulate teaching plans and teaching outlines suitable for higher normal schools in our country, and to translate the main textbooks of higher normal schools in the Soviet Union. In the process of compilation and translation, the principle of first solving the basic courses of each department should be followed. At the same time, on the basis of formulating teaching outlines, exchanging lecture notes and lecture scripts, and mastering Soviet textbooks, textbooks and reference books for higher normal schools should be gradually resolved. Currently, it is necessary to fully exchange existing textbooks among schools and oppose the practice of so-called "not sending them out if they are not mature."

    The conference specifically discussed the issue of improving existing teachers and training new teachers. Improving the political and ideological level and professional level of existing teachers is one of the determining factors in improving the quality of teaching. In order to improve existing teachers, the conference decided to strengthen the leadership of the systematic political theory learning of existing teachers, and organize teachers to conduct political theory learning in various forms under the principle of voluntariness; call on teachers to learn educational science, and through lesson preparation, compiling teaching outlines and textbooks, earnestly learn the advanced scientific achievements of the Soviet Union, in order to gradually improve the professional level of teachers and change old academic ideas and old teaching content; invite Soviet experts and outstanding Chinese teachers to give lectures and hold seminars in various places on a rotating basis in a planned manner; and regularly hold internal, regional, or national teaching experience exchange meetings and teaching demonstrations for professional courses. Specific methods were also prescribed for training teaching assistants and graduate students. In order to train new teachers, the staffing of teaching personnel should be appropriately relaxed, striving to achieve a standard of seven to one. The conference decided that undergraduate graduates of normal colleges should first satisfy the needs of higher normal schools for cultivating teaching assistants, graduate students, and supplementing teachers. If the quantity and quality of graduates cannot meet this need, local areas can transfer some senior high school teachers to supplement them. For teachers that each school cannot train on its own, the Ministry of Education will entrust the Renmin University of China and higher normal schools with better conditions to run research classes for training. The conference analyzed the phenomenon of disunity between new and old teachers that still exists in some schools, pointing out that young teachers must humbly learn from older teachers, and older teachers should recognize that they shoulder very important tasks for the country and the people, and are not only responsible for educating students, but also for cultivating new teachers for higher normal schools themselves. The conference also criticized some students in higher normal schools for disrespecting teachers, having poor discipline, and having extremist tendencies towards democratization, and advocated that students respect teachers and humbly learn from teachers.

    The conference also focused on discussing the issue of strengthening the leadership of higher normal education, and decided to implement hierarchical management under the unified leadership of the central government, in accordance with the principle of "unified leadership and hierarchical management," in order to strengthen leadership and give play to the enthusiasm of local schools. The conference also discussed how the principals of higher normal schools should lead and run higher normal schools well. The conference emphatically pointed out that in carrying out political and ideological work in schools, it is necessary to prevent two kinds of deviations: one is to separate political work from teaching work, and the other is to reduce political work to the level of administrative work. College presidents should lead the teaching work well and give play to the work enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of teachers. College presidents should seize the opportunity for teachers to study and improve their ideological level and professional ability, which is the determining factor for improving the quality of teaching.

    Vice Minister of Education of the Central People's Government Dong Chuncai called on workers in higher normal education across the country in his concluding remarks to continue to oppose subjectivism, oppose bureaucratism, and oppose decentralism, in order to achieve the goal of improving work and improving cadres. He asked everyone to implement the central government's instructions on increasing production and practicing economy, to streamline the staffing ratio of school administrative staff based on the principle of simplification, to practice strict economy, and to work together to run higher normal education well.

    高等师范教育会议闭幕
    确定了高等师范学校的发展方针和任务
    【新华社十三日讯】中央人民政府教育部召开的全国高等师范教育会议已在十三日闭幕。这是解放以来第一次专门研究高等师范教育的会议。会议明确了高等师范教育在国家建设中的重要地位，确定了高等师范学校今后五年内发展的方针和任务，明确了教学改革的要求和作法，并修订了高等师范学校的数学、物理、化学、生物、教育、地理、历史、和中国语文等八个主要专业的教学计划，规定了实施步骤和培养师资的办法。
    会议听取了中央教育部张奚若部长关于“全国高等师范教育的基本情况和今后方针任务”的报告，柳湜副部长关于“高等师范学校教学改革”的报告，高等师范教育司副司长李实关于“高等师范学校教学计划修订经过”的报告。会议期间，中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会习仲勋副主任、钱俊瑞秘书长都到会讲话，他们对高等师范教育在国家建设中的重要地位，高等师范教育今后五年内的方针、任务，加强学校的领导，以及学校中的政治工作等重大问题都作了重要指示。会议并请苏联专家崔可夫教授系统地介绍了苏联高等师范教育的经验。代表们对上述报告进行了深入细致的讨论。会议闭幕时，由中央教育部副部长董纯才作总结报告。
    这次会议根据我国逐步过渡到社会主义社会的总方针总路线，和人民教育事业为国家相应地培养建设人材、逐步地提高人民的文化水平的任务，确定了高等师范教育在国家建设和教育建设事业中的重要地位。会议指出，为了适应国家建设的需要，特别是适应国家工业化的需要，当前教育建设的重点是发展高等学校，以培养高级专门建设人材。而发展高等学校，就要发展中等学校，要发展中等学校，就要发展培养中等学校师资的高等师范学校，因此高等师范和高等工业学校就成为教育工作培养人材的重要环节。同时，为了适当地满足人民对初等教育的要求，就必须相应地发展中等师范学校，而高等师范学校就负有培养中等师范师资的任务。会议指出：高等师范学校办得好坏、数量的多少，直接影响到中等学校的质量和数量，间接影响到国家培养建设干部的计划。因此，高等师范教育是整个普通教育的重点，是办好和发展一切教育工作的重要关键。四年来，高等师范教育经过迅速恢复，并有很大发展，同时也进行了为工农开门、思想改造、院系调整、教学改革等一系列的初步改革工作，并获得了成就。但是，从旧中国继承下来的高等师范学校基础很差，目前高等师范学校在数量上还远不能适应国家和人民的需要，第一个五年计划要求补充中等学校师资十万人左右，单是明年就需要补充中等学校教师将近三万人，而高等师范学校除短期训练外五年内只能供应约七万人。在质量上也有待于大力提高。
    会议根据上述情况，确定高等师范教育在今后几年内的方针是“在整顿巩固现有高等师范教育的基础上，根据需要与可能，有计划、有准备地予以大力发展”。这就是要既注意到需要，又注意到可能；既注意到质量的提高，又注意到数量的发展。会议并决定今后五年内首先是把原来条件较好的高等师范学校逐步扩大规模，其次是有条件有准备地新建一些高等师范学校。会议指出：从中央教育部到地方各级教育行政部门和学校，都要本着实事求是的精神拟订发展计划，要防止两种思想偏向，一种是只顾需要，不顾条件的急躁情绪，另一种是只顾目前的条件，看不到可能创造的条件，只顾局部，不顾整体，片面强调质量，不顾当前现实需要的保守思想。为解决今后几年中等学校师资大量缺乏的现实问题，除了现行高等师范的学制（本科修业四年专修科二年）不变外，还必须采取多种临时过渡的办法来训练中等学校师资：如将本科毕业生提前一年毕业；选用一部分专修科优秀毕业生作高级中等学校教员；开办训练班，把选拔的初中教师训练成为高中教师。初级中等学校的师资需要更大，除扩大师范专科学校及附设师范学院的专修科的招生名额外，并可调训小学教师、短期训练师范毕业生等办法以补充现有师资的不足。此外，要求综合大学、高等体育学校、高等艺术学校为中等学校培养一部分文理各科、体育、音乐、美术等方面的师资。
    会议还着重地讨论了学习苏联进行教学改革的问题。会议认为：教学改革必须以苏联为师，苏联的先进科学成就应该虚心体会和接受。苏联曾经经历过的道路和具体做法应该仔细分析研究，作为工作中的重要参考。在当前情况下，教学改革为办好或提高高等师范教育的中心环节。教学改革是过渡时期对高等师范教育改造的中心环节。各校要善于动员、组织和领导教师积极参加教学改革，使教师在教学改革的过程中改造他们的教学思想，吸取先进的科学知识，并改进教学方法，从而提高教学质量。会议要求在第一个五年计划内必须争取拟出适合我国高等师范学校教学计划、教学大纲，译出苏联高等师范学校的主要教材，在编写和翻译的程序上，以首先解决各系的基础课程为原则。同时，在拟出教学大纲、交流讲稿讲义和掌握苏联教材的基础上，逐步解决高等师范学校的参考书和教科书。当前要充分交流各校现有教材，反对所谓“不成熟不外送”的作法。
    会议具体讨论了提高现有师资和培养新师资的问题。提高现有教师的政治思想水平和业务水平，是提高教学质量的决定因素之一。为了提高现有教师，会议决定：加强现有教师系统的政治理论学习的领导，组织教师在自愿原则下，用多种形式进行政治理论学习；号召教师学习教育科学，并通过备课、编写教学大纲和教材，认真学习苏联先进科学的成就，以逐步提高教师的业务水平，改变旧的学术思想和旧的教学内容；邀请苏联专家和中国优秀教师有计划地到各地轮回讲学和举行座谈；定期举行学校内部、地区性或全国性的专业课程的教学经验交流会和教学观摩。对培养助教和研究生也规定了具体办法。为了培养新的师资，在教学人员的编制上要适当放宽，争取做到七比一的标准。会议决定：师范学院的本科毕业生，应首先满足高等师范培养助教、研究生，补充师资的需要，如果毕业生的数量和质量，还不能满足这种需要，各地可抽调一部分高中教师补充。凡各校不能自己培养的师资，由中央教育部委托中国人民大学以及条件较好的高等师范学校举办研究班进行培养。会议分析了当前在有些学校中新老教师中还存在着的不团结现象，指出青年教师必须虚心向老年教师学习，老年教师应认识到自己对国家对人民肩负着很重要的任务，不仅负有教育学生的责任，同时还有培养高等师范本身新的师资的任务。会议还批判了高等师范学校中有些学生不尊敬教师，纪律不好，有极端民主化等偏向，提倡学生尊敬教师，虚心向教师学习。
    会议还着重讨论了加强高等师范教育的领导问题，决定根据“统一领导，分层管理”的原则，在中央统一领导下实行分级负责管理，以加强领导并发挥地方办学的积极性。对于高等师范学校校长如何领导办好高等师范学校的问题，会议也进行了讨论。会议着重指出：在进行学校的政治思想工作中，要防止两种偏向：一种是把政治工作与教学工作脱离开来，另一种是把政治工作降低到事务工作水平。院校长要把教学工作领导好，发挥教师的工作积极性、主动性和创造性。院校长应该抓紧教师学习，提高他们的思想水平和业务能力，这是提高教学质量的决定因素。
    中央人民政府教育部董纯才副部长在总结会上号召全国高等师范教育工作者继续进行反对主观主义、反对官僚主义和反对分散主义，以达到改进工作，提高干部的目的。他要求大家贯彻中央关于增产节约的指示，以精简的原则，紧缩学校行政勤杂人员编制比例，厉行节约，共同为办好高等师范教育而努力。
