    Cooperative in Cotton Producing Areas of Rugao County, Jiangsu Province Organizes Cotton Farmers to Sell Cotton in Batches and Turns Through Member Representatives
    In order to avoid congestion when cotton farmers sell cotton, cooperatives in cotton-producing areas of Rugao County, Jiangsu Province, organize cotton farmers to sell cotton in batches and turns through member representatives.
    Last year, when the Er'an Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Rugao County purchased cotton, it mobilized cotton farmers to organize themselves by township and village, scheduling dates to sell cotton in turn, which changed the past phenomenon of cotton farmers crowding to sell cotton, saving cotton farmers' time. The masses responded well. The vast majority of local cotton farmers hope that the cooperative will continue to adopt this method of cotton purchasing this year.
    This year, before the start of purchasing new cotton, grassroots cooperatives in cotton-producing areas of Rugao County successively held council meetings and member representative conferences to learn from the experience of the Er'an Supply and Marketing Cooperative in selling cotton in batches and turns. Member representatives welcomed this cotton purchasing method, believing that it could avoid the chaotic phenomenon of "squeezing to sell flowers, squeezing to issue tickets, squeezing to convert, squeezing to review, and squeezing to pay" when selling cotton. They said: In this way, the cooperative's funds will not be disconnected; we do not need to get up early and work in the dark to squeeze in to sell cotton, which can save a lot of time for production. As soon as the member representative conference ended, the member representatives went back to actively publicize the state's price policy and organize cotton farmers to sell cotton in an organized and phased manner.
    Since September 8, under the leadership of the local Party committee, grassroots cooperatives in cotton-producing areas of Rugao County have studied and arranged the time for each village to sell cotton, so that cotton farmers can sell cotton in an organized and orderly manner in batches and turns. Each cotton farmer generally spends only five minutes to sell the cotton and get the money. The Pingxi and Jiangyuan Supply and Marketing Cooperatives can weigh the cotton of 700 households per scale every day, without any congestion. Cotton farmers are very satisfied with this method. Chen Fengming, a cotton farmer in the seventh village of Liuba Township, said: "Last year, one time I waited from morning until 3:00 p.m., and my cotton had not been weighed yet, so I had to carry it back. This year, with this method, it is collected as soon as I arrive, and there is no crowding at all."
    While organizing cotton farmers to sell cotton in batches and turns, the Pingxi grassroots supply and marketing cooperative vigorously publicized the seasonal price difference of cotton through member representatives, and mobilized households that do not urgently need to sell cotton to sell less or sell slowly, making the cotton market more normal.

    江苏省如皋县各产棉区合作社
    通过社员代表组织棉农分期轮流售棉
    江苏省如皋县各产棉区合作社为了避免棉农售棉时拥挤，通过社员代表组织棉农分期轮流售棉。
    去年如皋县二案供销合作社收购棉花时，动员棉农按乡、按村组织起来，排定日期轮流售棉，改变了过去棉农售棉拥挤的现象，节省了棉农售棉时间，群众反映很好。当地绝大部分棉农今年都希望合作社继续采用这一办法收棉。
    今年如皋县各产棉区基层合作社在开始收购新棉以前，先后举行了理事会和社员代表大会，学习二案供销合作社分期轮流周转售棉的经验。社员代表都欢迎这一收棉办法，认为这样可以避免售棉时“卖花挤、开票挤、折算挤、复核挤、付款挤”的混乱现象。他们说：这样，合作社资金不会脱节；我们也不需要起早摸黑来挤着卖棉花，可以省出不少工夫去生产。社员代表大会一结束，社员代表们便回去积极宣传国家价格政策，组织棉农有组织地分期轮流售棉。
    从九月八日开始，如皋县各产棉区基层合作社在当地党委领导下，研究安排了各村卖棉花的时间，由棉农有组织、有秩序地分期轮流售棉。每户棉农一般只花五分钟就能卖完棉花，拿到款子。平西、姜元等供销合作社，一根秤每天可称七百户的棉花，一点也不拥挤。棉农对这个办法都很满意。刘坝乡第七村棉农陈凤明说：“去年有一次我从早上一直等到下午三点钟，还没有称到我的棉花，结果还是挑回去。今年用了这个办法，随到随收，一点都不挤。”
    平西基层供销合作社一面组织棉农分期轮流周转售棉，一面通过社员代表大力宣传棉花季节差价，动员不急需售棉户自动少卖或缓卖，棉花上市情况更加正常。
