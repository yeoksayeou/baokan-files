Editor's Note: The First Northeast Regional Drama, Music, and Dance Festival was held in Shenyang from July 25th to August 30th, lasting more than a month. It featured 94 performances, including 167 programs of Peking Opera, Ping Opera, Bangzi Opera, spoken drama, opera, music, and dance. On August 29th, Zhang Dongchuan, Deputy Director of the Cultural Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee, delivered a summary report of the conference. Based on the main content of this summary report, he wrote this article for this newspaper.

Several Issues Concerning Drama, Music, and Dance Work in the Northeast Region
Zhang Dongchuan

Continue to Deepen Immersion in Life, Reflect the Lives and Struggles of the People More Profoundly and Extensively

Nearly thirty plays reflecting modern life were presented at this Northeast Regional Drama, Music, and Dance Festival. From a thematic perspective, they depicted the contradictions between advanced and conservative ideas, individualism and patriotism, individual farming and mutual aid and cooperation. They relatively profoundly and extensively portrayed the real lives of the people in the new historical period of the nation. Not only in quantity, but also in quality, they can be said to be universally improved compared to the scripts seen in the previous two years. This is understandable. In recent years, especially since the Northeast Arts Creation Cadre Conference in January of this year, drama authors, directors, actors, etc., in various localities, with the specific assistance of responsible comrades, have relatively systematically gone deep into factories, basic construction sites, rural areas, forests, mines, battlefields, etc., to experience life and conduct diligent work, thus producing excellent award-winning plays such as "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River," "Women Representative," "Zhao Xiaolan," "Red Flag," "People Strive for Higher Ground," "Border Village," and "Female Teacher."

The spoken drama "In the Ranks of Construction" raised a major issue with universal significance in basic construction: when the nation enters a period of economic construction in a planned way, and a large number of farmers join the ranks of workers, it inevitably brings backward consciousness such as laxity, conservatism, and selfishness, and educating them in collectivism and labor discipline is a serious issue. After this play was performed, Shenyang, Anshan, and other places immediately requested public performances, indicating that basic construction work urgently needs works with such content. In addition, "Moon Bay" and "On Election Day," which reflect the general election movement, especially "Moon Bay," combined with production, reflected the people's enthusiastic participation in the general election as masters of the country. The author not only temporarily collected materials related to the general election but also used materials accumulated in daily life. This shows that as long as materials are constantly accumulated from life, it will not be difficult to express a certain political movement. We cannot set the task of cooperation against regular creation.

The spoken drama "Border Village" describes how the people in remote mountain villages changed the face of this desolate village along with the rapid development of the motherland's construction; the Ping Opera "Female Teacher" focuses on portraying a model rural female teacher with a distinct personality, wholeheartedly dedicated to the people's education, and with a strong sense of career; the Ping Opera "Husband and Wife Cooperation" describes mutual help, mutual respect, and the establishment of a correct and harmonious family and marital relationship, so that the husband can concentrate on production and increase greater wealth for the country. Although these works still have some shortcomings, they do not start from subjective wishes, but steadily start from life, from the extremely rich new life created by the people, thus avoiding the problem of generalization and giving people a fresh feeling.

In this festival, some works that successfully portrayed positive characters appeared. Such as Master Zhao in "Red Flag," Zhang Guirong in "Women Representative," especially the branch secretary Gao Zhenlin in "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River," all stood at the focus of contradictions and conflicts, and portrayed their spiritual outlook in the process of resolving contradictions and overcoming difficulties. The authors' treatment of these characters does not start from dogma or slogans, but from refinement and summarization from life. The characters' good qualities and noble morality are expressed through their characteristics, so they appear vivid and real. It must be seen that today, in various positions, there are already relatively mature positive characters, and some positive characters are growing. These characters are the main force in educating and encouraging the people to drive social progress, and they should stand on the dominant side of the contradiction at any time. If we examine the nearly two hundred scripts collected in the past two years, there are almost no works that successfully depict positive characters. Some authors are overly enthusiastic about seeing shortcomings and backwardness, and thus cannot keenly see the essential things that are growing and promoting social development. It is still meaningful to emphasize this issue again today.

Conceptualized and formulaic works cannot express the typicality of characters and environment. The Ping Opera "Shen Huiying" describes Wang Yukun, a slick and irresponsible manager of a private enterprise, pursuing Shen Huiying, a production expert in a state-owned factory who already has a happy partner. Shen's mother agreed to Shen's marriage with Wang only for the sake of rent, which caused a love entanglement. The author not only failed to realize the intention of satire but instead made people smell a kind of petty bourgeois vulgarity. The whole play starts from concepts and lacks life, and is a relatively unsuccessful work.

In order to improve the quality of works and continue to correct the problems of conceptualization and formularization in creation, we must study and apply the creative method of socialist realism well, strengthen theoretical and policy learning, combine creative activities, life practice, and self-transformation, and earnestly follow Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions: "China's revolutionary writers and artists, promising writers and artists, must go to the masses, must go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, wholeheartedly, to the most extensive and richest source, observe, experience, study, analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle, all original materials of literature and art, and then it is possible to enter the creative process."

Carefully Reform and Develop National Opera Art

In recent years, thanks to the joint efforts of comrades in opera work, some experiences have been explored in the reform of opera art, and some better works have also been produced, such as the excellent award-winning repertoires seen in this festival, such as "Tea Bottle Scheme," "Female Teacher," "Yang Ershe Asks for Alms" (above are Ping operas), "Three Unwillingnesses," "Anti-Xuzhou" (above are Peking operas), and many excellent performances. But it can be seen from the Peking and Ping opera programs performed that there are still many shortcomings in dealing with historical themes and portraying historical figures.

The Peking Opera "Anti-Xuzhou" absorbed nourishment from Qin Opera and other local operas, and relatively steadily and actively reformed the original fixed forms, deleted the terrifying images of court scenes, and relatively concisely and concentratedly expressed the theme thought and character characteristics. The author attempted to describe the ideological change process of intellectuals in feudal society participating in the people's uprising from hesitation to firmness through the character of Xu Da. But Xu Da is written as too weak, lacking the due knowledge and courage, and still hesitating and constantly faltering until disaster befalls him, which is not in line with the identity of Xu Da, who conquered the south and the north and laid the foundation for the founding of the Ming Dynasty. Secondly, "Anti-Xuzhou" consciously avoids the sharp national contradictions with foreign invasions, which cannot enable Xu Da to play a role at the focus of national contradictions, and inevitably places class contradictions above national contradictions, which is mainly caused by the adapter's failure to analyze historical figures in specific historical situations more specifically.

Some theaters wrote "Stealing the Tally to Rescue Zhao" to insinuate resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, idealizing Lord Xinling to be like a Communist Party member. Some theaters forcibly combined "Tears of a Poor Girl," which wrote about the struggle between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and "Liu Cuiping Cries at the Well," which wrote about despising the poor and loving the rich, with peasant uprisings, and regardless of the era, uniformly attached a bright tail of "joining the King Chuang," in order to insinuate land reform. This kind of anti-historical works has no educational significance. As Comrade Zhou Yang said in "Reforming and Developing National Opera Art," "The harm of anti-historicism lies in: it does not arm the people with the truth, but instills lies and absurd fabrications into the people; it does not guide the people to look forward, but guides the people to look backward; it does not cultivate the people's new patriotic ideas, but cultivates the people's narrow nationalist consciousness." We must study specific historical figures in specific historical environments, and cannot rigidly apply concepts and formulas. Opera workers should study history and political theory well, otherwise, they will not be able to correctly understand the historical environment and historical figures.

In dealing with myths and legends, a disrespectful attitude is often adopted. For example, the legend of "Zhang Yu Boils the Sea" expresses people's desire for freedom, happiness, and a reasonable life through the beautiful story of the love between Zhang Yu and the Dragon Girl. Although the organizers have made many efforts in this regard, when describing the character characteristics of Zhang Yu and the Dragon Girl, they even made them understand the ideas of the modern working class that labor creates the world, clearly establishing love on the basis of loving labor, and writing Zhang Yu as a working people. The Dragon Girl's maid went to mobilize the masses to fight against the Dragon King in order to help the marriage succeed and rigidly insinuated today's marriage law, which damaged the content of the original mythological drama.

Some people think that when writing mythological dramas, they can not have a historical point of view, not based on specific historical situations and historical conditions, and "fantasize casually" and "write freely" without any restrictions. This is a wrong understanding of myths and legends, and it is a crude subjective attitude. Using the love and marriage issues in mythological dramas to insinuate today's marriage law is a reflection of this incorrect thinking. But using it to express dissatisfaction with the feudal marriage system, such as "Liu Yi Delivers the Letter," which wrote about the unbearable painful life of the Dragon Girl after marrying the son of the Jingchuan Lord, forcing the Dragon Girl to come to the mortal world and marry Liu Yi, is precisely based on the life at that time, expressing the people's resistance to unreasonable marriage with rich imagination and beautiful images, and showing the pursuit of ideal marriage through mythological dramas. This point should be carried forward.

The work of sorting out and revising the original opera repertoire is an important work in the current reform of opera art. Through this work. On the one hand, we can better learn from the national opera art heritage, which is helpful to the creation of new opera works; on the other hand, we can promote the people's nature and realistic tradition, and use the excellent original repertoire as a traditional repertoire for circulation. This work is not only needed by the vast number of opera actors but also required by the vast number of people, so we must do it steadily and in a planned way. Some people think that "it is difficult to please" or "new is not as good as old," which is a specific manifestation of insufficient understanding of the importance of this work.

It can be seen from the festival that basically, the work of sorting out and revising opera is carried out with a cautious and serious attitude and has achieved results, but there are still not many good works like "Tea Bottle Scheme." At present, in the daily sorting and revision work, there are mainly two situations: one is that due to our lack of historical knowledge and artistic accomplishment and low level of political theory, despite taking a cautious attitude to carry out the work, some shortcomings or even errors are still inevitably generated. The above-mentioned handling of historical figures and treatment of mythological dramas is like this. Therefore, strengthening the study of political theory, history, and art has become an urgent task for opera workers.

Another situation is that a crude attitude of random editing and alteration is adopted towards the national opera art heritage. This error still occurs constantly in the Northeast. If it is not corrected in time, it will cause greater evil consequences. For example, the Ping Opera "Dream of the Red Chamber" performed by a troupe in Liaoxi Province is such a typical example. First, the author has never read the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber," but only transplanted it from Yue Opera, and at the same time added a few scenes, which were obviously added by the author based on subjective conjecture. This kind of random editing and alteration that deviates from the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber" not only damages the opera art but also spreads a bad influence on the Chinese literary masterpiece "Dream of the Red Chamber." Second, the correct tragedy can arouse people's resistance and hatred for the social system and classes that caused this tragedy. But the Ping Opera "Dream of the Red Chamber" conversely infects people with negative emotions. Some people feel pessimistic or even world-weary after watching it. Therefore, the Ping Opera "Dream of the Red Chamber" not only failed to reduce the shortcomings of Yue Opera but expanded its unhealthy part. Third, it inappropriately insinuated today's marriage law, making Lin Daiyu and Jia Baoyu jointly resist the family for the sake of fighting for freedom of marriage, and at the same time writing Lin Daiyu as a jealous woman who is jealous of love.

Others, such as some theaters do not distinguish between mythology and superstition, thinking that "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" is "promoting superstition in the new democratic society"; some theaters start from the characters' origin and composition, changing Li Jia into a poor man and turning the tragedy "Du Shiniang" into a comedy, allowing Li Jia to reunite with Du Shiniang; some theaters let Jiao Zhongqing and Liu Lanzhi escape together, attaching a bright tail to "Peacock Flies Southeast"; even some theaters use the hat of anti-superstition to publicly perform "Huang's Daughter Travels to the Underworld," and so on. This is mainly due to the past work of sorting out and revising, some of which emphasized quantity over quality, mechanically emphasized cooperating with tasks, and purely for business and other unsolemn and cautious erroneous views.

Continue to Deeply Learn from National Folk Music
Dance Art

In recent years, the music and dance, especially dance, in the Northeast region have made relatively significant progress, producing excellent programs such as "Red Silk Dance," "Fan Dance," and "Single Drum Dance." In this festival, we also saw two "Large Yangko" and dance programs such as "Farmers' Dance," "Oroqen Dance," "Red Scarf Dance," "Mongolian Dance," "Flower Cymbal Dance," "Lion Dance," and "Jianzi Dance." They expressed the healthy, joyful, and optimistic emotions of the people of all ethnic groups in the Northeast region creating a happy new life, and are fresh, lively, and full of strong national and folk colors. In terms of music, songs such as "People of the World Unite Tightly," "Flying Kites," "Living in One Family," "The Sun Comes Out and the Sky is Red," "Victory News," "A Small Red Flag," and "Daughter's Song" appeared, singing the fighting spirit and joyful mood in defending peace and production and construction. Folk storytelling Shandong Qinshu "Da Gang and Xiao Lan" and "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" were especially welcomed by the audience.

The reason why music and dance work has achieved these results is mainly because in recent years, especially since the First Northeast Music Work Conference in 1951, it has resolutely clarified the view of blindly worshiping the West, established the view of respecting and uninterruptedly diligently learning the national folk art tradition, and carried out relatively serious excavation, research, sorting, and creation work. The experience of recent years proves that the more national things are, the more popular they are with the masses, and the more international they are. The reason why the above-mentioned "Red Silk Dance" and other dances are widely loved by people at home and abroad proves that the direction we have adhered to is completely correct. However, these works are still relatively rough and need to be processed to make them more refined and complete. Further improve its ideological and artistic nature. Advocating learning from national folk art does not oppose learning from foreign countries, especially the advanced artistic experience of the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. Recently, art groups from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries have continuously come to China and the Northeast region to perform, which has had a good impact on the music and dance work in the Northeast region. For example, seeing the figurative performances of other people's chorus teams enlightened our chorus teams, changed the rigid performance methods, made them figurative, and thus more vividly and deeply expressed the ideological emotion of the songs. But we must learn and absorb foreign artistic nutrients on the basis of the national folk art tradition, and we must never copy them rigidly.

Learning from the national folk art tradition, in addition to better sorting out and revising the original programs of national folk art, the more important thing is to create music and dance works that can express modern life. Therefore, learning national folk art cannot be separated from life and can only focus on technology. Technology must be learned, but if you do not learn the life on which technology is based, you cannot truly learn technology well. For example, the "Kite Dance" performed this time attempted to express national style from clothing, performance, and other aspects, but lacked a deep life, and it did not look cordial enough. Therefore, our music and dance workers must go deep into the reality of life and combine life practice with self-transformation. We cannot think that this art form is not as complicated as drama and we can not go to life for hard study. Any work of art must express life, and music and dance are of course no exception.

There are especially few instrumental music creations with national style. In this festival, we heard the Suona performance "Celebrating Victory." Although it has not been able to better solve technical problems such as the orchestration and timbre coordination of Chinese and Western instruments, it healthily and beautifully expressed the heroic emotions of the people celebrating and dancing, and was loved by the audience. This creative attempt should be advocated.

In the festival, we saw dance dramas such as "For Eternal Peace and Happiness," "Fighting Friendship," and "The Boasting Wild Rooster," which all made us feel excited. This art form is just emerging in China. The outstanding dance drama "For Eternal Peace and Happiness" truly and healthily expressed the joyful emotions of the Korean people creating a happy life after liberation, gaining land, and under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The play vividly portrayed many characters and has a unique style. Music, dance, scenery, and other aspects are relatively complete. Although the latter part is not refined enough, the entire play can be said to be successful. The art form of dance drama will be welcomed by the vast number of people. We must cherish it, support it, and develop it.

Music is an indispensable and important part of opera. In the past, some music workers were unwilling to participate in drama music, especially opera music work. However, opera music has a close relationship with the vast audience. Starting from the needs of the masses and considering the development of music art, music workers have no reason to abandon this important position. In the past, they were unwilling to participate in this work because there were still some incorrect views on the national opera heritage. After the discussion of the issue of developing new opera, there have been great changes. We welcome this change, and opera workers welcome it even more warmly. Because opera art cannot be better developed without the participation of music workers. Music workers must first humbly study opera art, and music workers in opera departments should respect each other, learn from each other, cooperate sincerely, and steadily and actively enrich and develop opera music on the original basis. For example, the music arrangement of the Peking Opera "Broken Bridge" is an active attempt based on the original Peking Opera tunes and melodies. We saw that many Ping Opera repertoires were steadily processed and enriched on the basis of the original music. This creative attitude and preliminary achievements deserve our attention. There are many problems in opera music work, which need to be further studied and gradually solved in the future. (Attached pictures)

### 关于东北区戏剧、音乐、舞蹈工作的若干问题

专栏：

    编者按：东北区第一届戏剧、音乐、舞蹈观摩演出大会，自七月二十五日在沈阳举行，到八月三十日结束，历时一个多月，演出了九十四场，有京剧、评剧、梆子、话剧、歌剧、音乐、舞蹈等一百六十七个节目。八月二十九日，东北行政委员会文化局副局长张东川做了大会的总结报告。他根据这个总结报告的主要内容，给本报写了这篇文章。
    关于东北区戏剧、音乐、舞蹈工作的若干问题
    张东川
    继续深入生活，更深刻、广泛地反映人民的生活和斗争
    这次东北区戏剧音乐舞蹈会演，属于反映现代生活的剧作，将近三十个。从主题思想上看，它们描写了先进思想与保守思想，个人主义与爱国主义，单干与互助合作等等之间的矛盾。它们比较深刻而广泛地表现了国家新的历史时期人民的现实生活。不仅数量，即从质量上看，比前两年所看到的剧本，可以说是普遍地提高了。这是可以理解的。几年来，特别是自今年一月东北艺术创作干部会议以后，各地戏剧作者、导演、演员等在各地负责同志具体帮助下，比较有计划地深入工厂、基本建设工地、农村、森林、矿山、战场等体验生活，进行辛勤工作，因而产生了“春风吹到了诺敏河”“妇女代表”“赵小兰”“红旗”“人往高处走”“边外村”“女教师”等获奖的优秀剧作。
    话剧“在建设的行列里”提出了一个在基本建设中带有普遍性的重大问题：当国家有计划地进入经济建设时期，农民大批地投入工人的队伍里，不可免地带来散漫、保守、自私等落后意识，对他们进行集体主义、劳动纪律的教育是一个严重问题。这个剧演出之后，沈阳、鞍山等地马上要求公演，说明了基本建设工作迫切需要这样内容的作品。另外，反映普选运动的“月亮湾”和“在普选的日子里”，特别是“月亮湾”，结合生产，反映了人民热烈地以国家主人翁姿态参加普选的情况。作者不但临时搜集了有关普选的材料，而且运用了日常所积累的素材。这说明了只要日常不断地从生活里积累素材，要表现某一政治运动，也不会感到吃力。我们不能把配合任务和经常创作对立起来。
    话剧“边外村”写出了僻地山村的人民如何与祖国建设事业突飞猛进的发展同时，改变了这一荒凉乡村的面貌；评剧“女教师”集中地刻划了一位性格鲜明、专心致志于人民教育事业，有着坚强事业心的模范乡村女教师；评剧“夫妻合作”描写互相帮助，互相尊重，建立正确的和睦家庭和夫妻关系，使丈夫安心生产，给国家增加更大财富。这些作品虽然还有某些缺点，但他们不是从主观愿望出发，而是踏踏实实地从生活，从人民创造的极其丰富的新生活出发，因而避免了一般化的毛病，给人以新鲜的感觉。
    在这次会演中，出现了一些刻划正面人物比较成功的作品。如“红旗”中的赵师傅、“妇女代表”中的张桂蓉，特别是“春风吹到了诺敏河”中的支部书记高振林，都站在矛盾与冲突的焦点上，从解决矛盾、克服困难的过程中，刻划了他们的精神面貌。作者对这些人物的处理不是从教条，从口号出发，而是从生活中提炼、概括出来的。人物的优良品质和高尚道德，是通过他们的特性表现出来的，因此看来生动而真实。必须看到，今天在各个岗位上，已经有了较成熟的正面人物，有些正面人物正在成长着。这些人物是教育和鼓舞人民带动社会前进的主要力量，他们在任何时候都应站在矛盾的主导方面。如果把两年来所收集到的将近二百个剧本检查一下，写正面人物较成功的作品几乎没有。有些作者，过分热中于看缺点和落后面，因而不能锐敏地看到那些正在成长的推动社会发展的本质事物。今天再强调地提出这一问题仍是有意义的。
    概念化、公式化的作品表现不出人物和环境的典型性。评剧“沈慧英”是描写私营企业一个油腔滑调的甩手经理王玉坤追求一个有了美满对象的国营工厂生产能手沈慧英。沈母只是为了房钱，同意了沈与王的婚事，引起了一场恋爱纠葛。作者非但没有实现讽刺的意图，反而使人闻到一种小市民的庸俗气味。全剧从概念出发，缺乏生活，是一个比较失败的作品。
    为了提高作品质量，继续纠正创作中的概念化、公式化的毛病，我们必须很好地学习和运用社会主义现实主义的创作方法，必须加强理论和政策学习，把创作活动、生活实践与自我改造结合起来，切实遵循毛泽东同志的指示：“中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切文学和艺术的原始材料，然后才有可能进入创作过程。”
  审慎地改革和发展民族戏曲
      艺术
    几年来，由于戏曲工作的同志们共同努力的结果，在戏曲艺术改革工作上曾摸索出了一些经验，也产生了一些较好作品，如在这次会演中看到的“茶瓶计”“女教师”“杨二舍化缘”（以上评剧）“三不愿意”“反徐州”（以上京剧）等获奖的优秀剧目以及很多优秀的演出。但从演出的京、评剧的节目中可以看出，在处理历史题材，表现历史人物方面，还有不少缺点。
    京剧“反徐州”从秦腔等地方戏吸取了养料，比较稳步地积极地改革了原有固定形式，删除了公堂等场的恐怖形象，比较简炼集中地表现了主题思想和人物性格。作者企图通过徐达这一人物，来描写封建社会知识分子参加人民起义从动摇到坚定的思想变化过程。但把徐达写得过于懦弱，缺少应有的见识、胆略，直到祸临己身，还动摇得当机不断，这是不大符合于南征北战，为明朝开国奠基的徐达这一人物身分的。其次，“反徐州”一剧有意识地避开与异族侵略之间的尖锐的民族矛盾，这就不能使徐达这一人物在民族矛盾的焦点上发挥作用，也不可免地把阶级矛盾摆在民族矛盾之上，这主要是改编者未能更具体地分析具体历史情况中的历史人物所造成。
    有的剧院编写“窃符救赵”，用以影射抗美援朝，把信陵君理想化到像一个共产党员。有的剧院把写婆媳之间斗争的“贫女泪”，把写嫌贫爱富的“刘翠屏哭井”等，都生拉硬扯地与农民起义结合在一起，不管时代如何，一律按上“投奔闯王”的光明尾巴，以之影射土地改革。这一类反历史主义的作品是没有什么教育意义的。正如周扬同志在“改革和发展民族戏曲艺术”一文中所说，“反历史主义的害处就在：它不是以真理武装人民，而是把谎话和不伦不类的杜撰灌输给人民；它不是引导人民向前看，而是引导人民向后看；它不是培养人民的新的爱国主义的思想，而是培养人民狭隘民族主义的意识。”我们必须研究具体的历史环境中的具体的历史人物，不能以概念和公式来硬套。戏曲工作者应该很好地学习历史，学习政治理论，否则就无从正确地理解历史环境和历史人物。
    在对待神话传说上，也往往采取了不够尊重的态度。例如“张羽煮海”的传说，是通过张羽与龙女的爱情这一优美的故事，表现了人们对于自由、幸福、合理的生活的渴望。虽然整理者在这一方面做了不少努力，但对于描写张羽与龙女的人物性格时，甚至使他们懂得劳动创造世界这类现代工人阶级的思想，把爱情明确地建立在爱劳动的基础上，并把张羽写成劳动人民。龙女的丫环为了帮助婚姻能够成功而去发动群众，与龙王抗争，以及生硬地影射了今天的婚姻法，结果就损伤了原有神话剧的内容。
    有人以为编写神话剧，可以不要历史观点，不根据具体的历史情况和历史条件，不受任何限制地“随便幻想”，“自由编写”。这是对于神话传说的错误理解，是一种粗暴的主观态度。以神话剧中恋爱婚姻问题来影射今天的婚姻法，就是这种不正确思想的反映。但是以它来表现对封建社会婚姻制度的不满，如“柳毅传书”写了龙女与泾川君之子婚后难以忍受的痛苦生活，迫使龙女临凡与柳毅结为眷属，正是在当时的生活基础上，以丰富的想像和美丽的形象，表现了人民对于不合理婚姻的反抗，通过神话剧展示了对于理想婚姻的追求。这一点是应该加以发扬的。
    戏曲原有剧目的整理和修改工作，是目前戏曲艺术改革中的一项重要工作。通过这项工作。一方面可以更好地向民族戏曲艺术遗产学习，有助于新的戏曲作品的创作；另一方面可以发扬其中的人民性及现实主义传统，将优秀的原有剧目作为传统的保留剧目加以流传。这项工作，不但为广大戏曲演员所需要，而且也为广大人民所要求，所以我们必须稳步地，有计划地来做。有人认为“费力不讨好”或“新不如旧”，这是对这一工作的重要性认识不足的具体表现。
    从会演中看出基本上都是以慎重的严肃的态度来进行戏曲的整理和修改工作，而且获得了成绩，但像“茶瓶计”那样的好作品到底还不多。目前，在日常的整理修改工作上，主要地有两种情况：一种是由于我们的历史知识和艺术修养不足和政治理论水平不高，尽管采取慎重态度去进行工作，仍不免产生一些缺点甚至错误。像上述处理历史人物和对待神话剧的情况，就是这样。因此加强对于政治理论、历史、艺术的学习，就成为戏曲工作者的迫切任务。
    另外一种情况则是对待民族戏曲艺术遗产，采取了胡编滥改的粗暴态度。这种错误，在东北仍不断发生，如果不及时加以纠正，就会造成更大的恶果。比如辽西省有一剧团演出的评剧“红楼梦”，就是这样一个典型的例子。第一，作者根本没看过小说“红楼梦”，只是从越剧加以移植，同时又加进了几场，这几场显然是作者根据主观的臆造加进去的。这种脱离开小说“红楼梦”的胡编滥改，不但损伤了戏曲艺术，而且也给中国的文学巨著“红楼梦”散布了恶劣的影响。第二，正确的悲剧能够引起人们对于造成这一悲剧的社会制度、阶级的反抗和痛恨。而评剧“红楼梦”却相反地使人们感染了消极情绪，有人看了就感到悲观甚至厌世。因此，评剧“红楼梦”非但未能减少越剧的缺点，反而将它那种不健康的部分扩大了。第三，它不恰当地以之影射今天的婚姻法，使林黛玉同贾宝玉共同为争取婚姻自由而反抗家庭，同时把林黛玉写成了争风吃醋的妒妇。
    其他，比如有的剧院神话与迷信不分，认为“梁山伯与祝英台”是“在新民主主义社会里宣传迷信”；有的剧院从人物的出身成份出发，把李甲改成穷人，把悲剧“杜十娘”改成喜剧，让李甲同杜十娘团圆；有的剧院让焦仲卿与刘兰芝双双逃走，给“孔雀东南飞”按上了光明的尾巴；甚至有的剧院借反迷信的帽子，公演“黄氏女游阴”等等。这主要是由于过去整理修改工作有的是重量不重质，机械地强调配合任务，单纯为了营业等不够严肃、慎重的错误观点所致。
  继续深入地向民族民间音乐
      舞蹈艺术学习
    几年来，东北区的音乐、舞蹈，特别是舞蹈，有了比较显著的发展，产生了“红绸舞”“扇子舞”“单鼓舞”等优秀节目。在这次会演中又看到了两个“大秧歌”及“农乐舞”“鄂伦春舞”“红围舞”“蒙古舞”“花钹舞”“狮子舞”“毽子舞”等舞蹈节目。它们表现了东北区各民族人民创造幸福的新生活的健康、喜悦的乐观主义情绪，和新鲜、活泼、富有浓厚的民族民间的色彩。在音乐方面，出现了歌曲“全世界人民团结紧”“放风筝”“生活在一家”“太阳出来满天红”“胜利捷报”“一面小红旗”“闺女之歌”等，歌唱了保卫和平和生产建设中的战斗情绪和喜悦心情。民间说唱山东琴书“大刚与小兰”、“梁山伯与祝英台”等，特别受到了观众的欢迎。
    音乐舞蹈工作所以获得了这些成绩，主要是由于几年来特别是自从一九五一年东北第一届音乐工作会议以后，曾坚决地澄清了盲目崇拜西洋的观点，树立了尊重与不间断的刻苦学习民族民间艺术传统的观点，进行了比较认真的发掘、研究、整理与创造工作。几年来的经验证明：越是民族的东西，越受群众欢迎，也就越有国际性。上述“红绸舞”等之所以受到国内外人民广泛的爱戴，就证实了我们所坚持的方向是完全正确的。但，这些作品还比较粗糙，需要加工，使之更趋精炼、完整。进一步提高其思想性和艺术性。提倡向民族民间艺术学习，并不反对向外国，尤其是苏联以及人民民主国家的先进艺术经验学习。近来，苏联以及各人民民主国家的艺术团体不断到中国，到东北区来演出，对东北区的音乐舞蹈工作有了良好的影响。比如看到人家合唱队那种富于形象性的演出，就使我们的合唱队得到启发，改变了呆板的演出方法，使它形象化，因而就更活泼、更深刻地表达了歌曲的思想情感。但是我们必须在民族民间艺术传统的基础上来学习和吸收外国的艺术养分，决不能硬搬。
    向民族民间艺术传统学习，除为了更好地整理修改民族民间艺术的原有节目之外，更重要的是为了创作出能表现现代生活的音乐和舞蹈作品。因此，学习民族民间艺术，就不能脱离开生活，单纯从技术上着眼。技术要学，但不去学技术所依据的生活，就不能把技术真正学好。比如这次演出的
  “风筝舞”，企图从服装、表演等方面表现民族风格，但缺乏深厚的生活，看起来就不够亲切。因此我们音乐舞蹈工作者必须深入生活实际，使生活实践与自我改造结合起来。不能认为这种艺术形式不像戏剧那样复杂，就可以不去向生活进行刻苦的学习。任何艺术作品都要表达生活，音乐舞蹈当然也不能例外。
    在器乐方面富有民族风格的创作尤其少。这次会演中，我们听到了唢呐演奏“欢庆胜利”，它虽然在中国乐器与西洋乐器的配器、音色的调谐等技术问题上，还没能更好的解决，但它却健康、优美地表现了人民欢腾鼓舞的豪放情绪，为观众所喜爱。这种创造性的尝试，是应该提倡的。
    在会演中，我们看到了“为了永远的和平与幸福”“战斗的友谊”和“吹牛的野鸡先生”等舞剧，它们都使我们感到兴奋。这种艺术形式，在中国还刚刚兴起。“为了永远的和平与幸福”这一出色的舞剧，真实地健康地表现了朝鲜族人民在解放以后，获得了土地，在共产党、毛主席领导下，创造幸福生活的喜悦情绪。剧中生动地刻划了很多人物，有独特的风格。音乐、舞蹈、布景等方面，都比较完整。虽然后一部分不够精练，但整个剧说来是成功的。舞剧这种艺术形式将被广大人民所欢迎，我们要珍视它，扶植它，使之发展。
    音乐是歌剧不可缺少的重要的组成部分。过去，有些音乐工作者不愿意参加戏剧音乐，特别是戏曲音乐工作。但是，戏曲音乐同广大观众有着密切联系，从群众的需要出发，从音乐艺术的发展着想，音乐工作者没有任何理由放弃这一重要的阵地。过去不愿意参加这项工作，是因为对于民族戏曲遗产还存在着某些不正确的看法，经过发展新歌剧问题的讨论之后，已经有了很大改变。我们欢迎这种改变，戏曲工作者就更加热烈欢迎。因为戏曲艺术，如果没有音乐工作者参加，就不能更好地发展。音乐工作者首先必须向戏曲艺术虚心地进行研究，戏曲部门的音乐工作者应该互相尊重，互相学习，真诚合作，在原来基础上稳步地积极地加以丰富和发展戏曲音乐。比如京剧“断桥”的音乐配曲，就是在原有京剧曲调旋律的基础上进行了积极的尝试。看到很多评剧剧目，在原有音乐的基础上进行了稳步的加工和丰富。这种创作态度和初步的成就值得我们重视。戏曲音乐工作中有不少问题，以后尚需要进一步很好地研究并逐步求得解决。（附图片）
