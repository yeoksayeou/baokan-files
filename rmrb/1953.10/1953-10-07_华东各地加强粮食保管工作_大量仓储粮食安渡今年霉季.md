East China Strengthens Grain Storage Work
Large Quantities of Stored Grain Safely Weather This Year's Mildew Season

In the first half of this year, East China strengthened its grain storage work, and a large quantity of stored grain safely weathered the mildew season.

In the first half of this year, the stored grain in East China (including the requisitioned grain and purchased grain from the local autumn harvest last year, the purchased grain from this summer, and the disaster relief grain transferred from other regions) showed that the quality of the requisitioned grain was relatively good, generally with a moisture content of around 13 percent. The quality of the purchased grain was lower, generally with a moisture content of around 15 percent and more impurities. The disaster relief grain, because it came from various regions, was of uneven quality, generally with a higher moisture content than the requisitioned and purchased grain. Some of it had a high moisture content of 20 to 25 percent and showed varying degrees of mildew. In order to ensure that the stored grain did not become moldy or infested with insects, the East China Grain Bureau instructed all warehouses to clean and disinfect their warehouses each time they were empty, inspect the grain entering the warehouse, and store it separately according to its quality. Since the spring of this year, the bureau has been instructing all warehouses from top to bottom to strengthen their storage work. Various types of grain were ranked according to quality, and safe grain, semi-safe grain, unsafe grain, and dangerous grain were identified and treated with methods such as sunning, ventilation, cooling, sifting, and spraying pesticides. Anhui Province also experimented with using high-temperature drying to reduce the moisture content of grain and dangerous grain. During this process, various localities mobilized the grain depots to formulate grain protection plans, making grain protection work a regular practice. Since the beginning of the mildew season, all localities have closely monitored changes in the grain situation. In addition to sealing warehouses with better conditions and higher grain quality to prevent the intrusion of humid air, they have also adopted various methods, such as manual labor and pesticides, to effectively prevent the gradual increase in the mildew rate and insect infestation rate of grain during the mildew season. This has greatly reduced the grain loss rate. For example, the average mildew rate of stored grain in the entire region in January was 0.42 percent. After entering the mildew season, the mildew rate not only did not increase, but actually decreased to 0.4 percent in June. The insect infestation rate was 12.8 percent in March, but it dropped to 11.2 percent in June. In the past six months, warehouses in various localities have not only preserved the quality of good grain and reduced losses, but also safely preserved over 3.2 billion jin of unsafe grain. At the same time, various warehouses learned various rat-catching methods from the local masses and caught more than 573,000 rats in the past six months, which greatly reduced the loss of grain due to rats.

The grain storage work of warehouses in various parts of East China in the first half of this year still has shortcomings. This is mainly because some county and district leaders and warehouse directors have not done enough political education for the storage personnel, the technical guidance is poor, a few storage personnel do not fully understand the important significance of doing a good job in grain storage, they are not content with their work, and they have not fully发挥 their enthusiasm and creativity. Grain protection work has not been carried out in a balanced manner, and the business guidance and specific assistance to the cooperative's grain storage have been neglected, resulting in serious mildew accidents in the grain managed by the cooperative throughout the region. Accepting past lessons, the East China Grain Bureau is now actively strengthening the inspection and leadership of grain protection work to overcome the above shortcomings.

### 华东各地加强粮食保管工作  大量仓储粮食安渡今年霉季

    华东各地加强粮食保管工作
    大量仓储粮食安渡今年霉季
    今年上半年，华东各地加强粮食保管工作，大量仓储粮食安渡霉季。
    华东区今年上半年的仓储粮食（包括有本地去年秋季的征收粮、收购粮，今年夏季收购粮和由外区调进的救灾粮）中，征收粮质量较好，一般含水分在百分之十三上下，收购粮质量较低，含水分一般在百分之十五上下，含杂质也比较多；而救灾粮因为来自各地，粮色不齐，一般含水分较征收粮及收购粮为高，其中有部分含水分达百分之二十至二十五的高水分粮，且带有不同程度的霉变。华东粮食管理局为保证仓储粮食不霉坏、不生虫，在每次空仓时都布置各仓库进行清仓消毒，对进仓粮食加以检验，好坏分开储存；今年春季以来，又自上而下地布置各仓库加强保管工作，各种粮食按质量排队，鉴别出安全粮、半安全粮、不安全粮及危险粮，分别进行曝晒、过风、摊凉、过筛及喷射药剂等办法处理。安徽省还试创高温烘干水分粮及危险粮的办法。各地在这一工作过程中，发动各粮库制订了保粮计划，使保粮工作变为经常化。自进入霉季以后，各地都紧紧地掌握粮食的变化情况，除对仓房条件较好、粮质较高的仓库进行密闭，以防止湿空气侵入外，并根据霉季以后，气温和湿度的增加，对条件较差的粮库，按照粮食变化的情况，分别采取人工、药剂等各种方法，有效地防止了粮食在霉季逐月加大霉变率及虫害率的状况，大大地降低了粮食的损耗率，如一月份全区仓储粮食的平均霉变率为百分之零点四二，进入霉季以后，霉变率不但没有提高，相反的到六月份还下降为零点四；虫害率在三月份为百分之十二点八，而到六月份竟降为百分之十一点二。半年中，各地仓库不但保住了质量好的粮食减少损失，而且有部分数达三十二亿多斤的不安全粮，也得到安全的保证。同时，各仓库并吸取当地群众各种捕鼠的办法，先后在半年中共捕鼠达五十七万三千多只，也大大减低了老鼠对粮食的损耗。
    华东区各地仓库在今年上半年保粮工作中，仍然有缺点。这主要是有些县、区领导上及仓库的负责人，对保管人员的政治教育工作做得不够，技术指导差，少数保管人员对做好保粮工作的重要意义认识不足，不安心工作，没有充分发挥积极性和创造性，保粮工作还开展得不平衡，忽视了对基层合作社保管粮食的业务指导和具体帮助，致使在全区合作社的管理粮中，发生有严重的霉变事故。接受过去教训，华东粮食管理局，现正积极加强对保粮工作的检查和领导，克服以上缺点。
