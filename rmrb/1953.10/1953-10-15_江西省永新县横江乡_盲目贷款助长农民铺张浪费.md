In the past year, Hengjiang Township, Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, issued 77.99 million yuan in credit loans (through credit cooperatives), 22.74 million yuan in various agricultural loans, 3,000 jin of relief grain, and 8.3 million yuan in production subsidies for military families and revolutionary martyrs' families. These measures played a certain role in helping farmers solve difficulties with production and living materials, revitalizing rural finance, and combating usury. However, due to cadres' insufficient understanding of the significance of state loans and the policies and guidelines for credit lending, there were many deviations in the loan process, mainly:

First, there was a lack of investigation and research, and the loan recipients were not clearly understood, leading to a phenomenon of "accepting all comers and meeting every request" and blind, indiscriminate lending. Many farmers used the loans for speculative business, thinking that "the government's money is easy to borrow." For example, Peng Xuegou, a farmer in the township, used loans to transport timber several times, earning hundreds of millions of yuan in profits. As a result of such blind lending, loans could not be used for developing production. Many farmers gambled, indulged in excessive eating and drinking, and some even used loans to hire Taoist priests and worship gods. For example, farmers in Huangjia Village borrowed 2 million yuan to worship gods, resulting in significant waste. According to typical investigations in the township's Guoyuan and Changtang districts, only 25 percent of loans were used by farmers for agricultural production; 28.1 percent were used for weddings, funerals, and a small amount of food; and as much as 46.9 percent were used for speculative business operations, almost half of the total loans. This naturally fueled farmers' capitalist management ideas.

Second, the style of average apportionment and coercive orders was very serious. When Guoyuan Village distributed the first batch of fertilizer powder, it stipulated an average of 6.5 jin per household, regardless of whether the masses wanted it or not. After the second batch of fertilizer powder arrived, the farmers no longer wanted it. In order to complete the task of fertilizer lending, the cadres insisted on distributing it, even if the masses didn't want it, and weighed out 5.5 jin per household, personally carrying baskets to deliver it to their doorsteps, leaving the farmers both amused and annoyed. During the distribution of fertilizer loans in Dongli Village, all 73 households in the village were apportioned, with each person receiving two jin. Even landlords and rich peasants were given a share without exception.

Third, there was a phenomenon of cadres borrowing more for private gain in the lending and distribution of relief grain. This year, cadres accounted for three of the five households receiving relief in Guoyuan District. Last year, out of the 3,000 jin of relief grain distributed in the township, cadres from 16 households received 1,160 jin. According to investigations, only one of these households was genuinely in need of relief. As a result, the masses were very dissatisfied and said, "Relief grain is for relieving cadres, and subsidies are also for subsidizing cadres." Some even used their positions to distribute loans to relatives and friends. For example, Chen Huangduo, the leader of the loan group in Guoyuan District, did not lend to genuinely needy households but instead lent to his son-in-law (a middle peasant) for other purposes.

From the above situation, it is clear that the problems existing in the township's loan work are quite serious. The local leading authorities should pay sufficient attention to them and correct them in a timely manner.

    江西省永新县横江乡
    盲目贷款助长农民铺张浪费
    江西省永新县横江乡，一年来放出信用贷款（通过信用合作社）七千七百九十九万元，各种农贷二千二百七十四万元，救济粮三千斤，军属、烈属生产补助金八百三十万元。在帮助农民解决生产、生活资料困难、活跃农村金融以及打击高利贷上，都起了一定的作用。但由于干部对国家贷款的意义和信用放款的政策、方针认识不够，在贷款中有很多偏差，主要是：
    一、不调查不研究，对贷款的对象心中没底，形成“来者不拒、有求必应”盲目乱发的现象。不少农民由于“政府的钱好借”，用借款去作投机生意。如该乡农民彭雪狗用贷款贩运木材数次，获利数百万元。这样盲目贷放的结果，使贷款不能用于发展生产，有不少农民赌博、大吃大喝，甚至有的用借款请道士、敬神。如黄家村农民贷款二百万元用于敬神，造成很大的浪费。据该乡果园、长塘两区的典型调查，农民将借款用于农业生产者仅占百分之二十五；用于婚丧喜庆少数口粮上者占百分之二十八点一；用于经营生意投机牟利者竟达百分之四十六点九，几乎为贷款总数的一半。这自然助长了农民的资本主义经营思想。
    二、平均摊派、强迫命令的作风很严重。该乡果园村贷放第一批肥田粉时，不顾群众愿意与否，就规定每户平均六点五斤。第二批肥田粉运到后，农民就再也不要了。干部为了完成贷肥任务，群众不要也不行，即按每户五斤半称好，亲自提篮子挨户送上门来，弄得农民哭笑不得。东里村在发放肥贷中，全村七十三户，户户摊派，每人两斤，在发放中两户地主、富农也毫无例外的同样有一份。
    三、在贷款和发放救济粮中，存在着干部多借营私的现象。今年果园区被救济的五户中，干部占了三户。去年全乡发救济粮三千斤，干部十六户就得了一千一百六十斤，据调查其中只有一户是应该救济的。因此群众很不满意地说：“救济粮是救济干部，补助金也是补助干部。”有的还凭职权，将贷款分给亲戚朋友。如果园区贷款小组长陈荒朵，不贷给真正的困难户，却借给他女婿（中农）作别的事情。
    从以上情况看来，该乡在贷款工作中存在的问题是较严重的，当地的领导机关应引起足够的重视，并及时纠正。
