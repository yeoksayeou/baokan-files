    China Slide Company Checks Waste of Materials

    Letter from China Slide Company: The criticism made by reader Xing Difei in the "Summary of Readers' Letters" column on September 24th regarding our company's waste is basically correct; we sincerely accept it.

    In the past, our company did not pay enough attention to product quality, resulting in some films having poor image quality and outdated content, and some films having inaccurate registration and blurred lines during printing. In addition, our inspection system was not sound, so we could not detect shortcomings and remedy them in the production process in time. Therefore, after our inspection in April this year, including the films accumulated by the former Electro-Educational Tool Manufacturing Plant, a total of more than 560,000 slides could no longer be used, wasting a large amount of state property. In terms of sales, our company also accumulated a large amount of funds. The reasons for this, in addition to untimely products and poor quality, are also due to the serious passive "waiting for customers" mentality in our business operations. In addition, the disposal of old slide projectors as waste and the waste of iron sheets in the manufacture of slide projectors are also true.

    Now, the leadership of our company has reviewed the above-mentioned behavior of wasting state property and has conducted education for all cadres. We have taken new measures to strive to improve product quality and shorten the production process, and to improve business methods and actively contact various places to promote sales, in order to improve the past waste of slides. As for the defective products that have been created in the past, a team has been organized to be responsible for handling them.

### 中国幻灯公司检查浪费资材的情况

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中国幻灯公司检查浪费资材的情况
    中国幻灯公司来信：九月二十四日“读者来信摘要”栏所刊读者邢涤非对我公司浪费现象的批评，基本上是正确的；我们诚恳接受。
    我公司过去对产品质量不够重视，以致有的片子画面形象不好、内容过时，有的片子印制时套色不准、线条模糊；加上我们的检查制度也不健全，以致在生产过程中不能及早发现缺点，加以补救。因此，经我们在今年四月间检查，连前电化教育工具制造所积压下来的片子在内，不能再用的幻灯片共达五十六万多张，浪费了国家大批财产，在销售方面，我公司也积压了大量资金。其原因除产品不及时和质量不高外，还由于我们的经营工作中有着严重的等客上门的消极思想。此外，把旧幻灯机作废品处理和制幻灯机时浪费铁片等情况也都属实。
    现在，我公司领导方面对上述浪费国家财产的行为已作了检讨，并向全体干部进行了教育。我们已采取新的措施争取提高产品的质量与缩短制作的过程，并改善经营方法，主动与各地联系推销，以改善过去浪费幻灯片的情况。至于过去造成的废品，也已组织小组负责处理。
