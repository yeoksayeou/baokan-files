The repatriation of prisoners of war who should be directly repatriated took place between the enemy and us from August 5th to September 6th. Now, more than 6,000 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have returned to the embrace of the motherland, but approximately 14,000 are still unable to be directly repatriated. These are the prisoners of war so-called "unwilling to be repatriated" by the enemy. What exactly is going on with these approximately 14,000 so-called "unwilling to be repatriated" prisoners of war? This can be clearly seen from the accusatory materials of the returning captured personnel.

Before the enemy's "screening" massacre of prisoners of war in April 1952, the vast majority of captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army were imprisoned on Geoje Island—this "island of death" of less than 300 square kilometers. The imprisonment situation was roughly as follows: approximately 8,400 people in Concentration Camp No. 86, approximately 7,700 people in Concentration Camp No. 72, approximately 1,500 people in Concentration Camp No. 70, approximately 230 people in Concentration Camp No. 71, approximately 100 people in Concentration Camp No. 61 (the so-called concentration camp for war criminals); each concentration camp was called a regiment, under which were battalions, companies, and platoons. Other captured personnel were concentrated in Busan, Masan, and other places.

These concentration camps were all set up on open ground, surrounded by six high barbed wire fences with electric current running through them. Bunkers were lined up inside and outside the barbed wire, and American soldiers with live ammunition stood guard all around. Tanks and armored vehicles frequently patrolled back and forth, with extremely strict security. At night, the enemy's huge searchlights shone back and forth over the tents where our captured personnel lived, and blood-red tracer bullets occasionally swept over the heads of the captured personnel. Military hounds made horrifying howls. Within the barbed wire, there were also many enemy security guards, and our captured personnel were not allowed to move a single step at will. The screams and groans of torture could be heard everywhere, and every captured person could be pulled out for secret interrogation at any time. Terror enveloped this small island.

The captured personnel were crammed into rows of dirty and dark tin barracks, or five or sixty people squeezed into a tent. Inside, there was only rotten straw that was never changed, and it was extremely humid; it did not keep out the rain in summer or the wind in winter.

Each captured person could only eat two small military bowls of coarse sorghum or barley and a little salted radish soup per day. Before dawn, they were driven out to do hard labor. When there was no hard labor, they were ordered to smash rocks, which were smashed and filled into the sea. Or they went to dig pits, with people digging in the front and people filling in the back.

In a notification to U.S. Army Commander Raymond Lawday of the prisoner-of-war camp, on December 12, 1951, all captured personnel in Concentration Camp No. 71 wrote: "Since we were captured, we have never had a full meal. In this severe winter, we are still wearing only a few single layers of clothing and a single pair of pants. All captured personnel are suffering from severe malnutrition, and more than 80 percent of the people have frozen legs or are suffering from other diseases..."

The enemy often forced the captured personnel to listen to reactionary lessons. During the class, the surrounding area was full of enemy agents holding sticks and knives, and no one was allowed to move. If the captured personnel showed slight boredom with these reactionary lessons, they would be beaten severely. More than 50 people in the third platoon of the first battalion of the 72nd Regiment were beaten while "attending classes." Li Decai and Wei Lin of the fourth battalion were beaten more than 40 times and punished with "crawling" for two hours because they refused to make anti-communist remarks after the class.

After the Korean armistice negotiations began in July 1951, in order to forcibly detain our captured personnel, the enemy successively transferred more than 150 "experienced" Chiang Kai-shek bandits agents from Taiwan (sent through Wang Fei Dongyuan, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit ambassador to Busan), who served as "instructors" and other positions in the prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island. In late July, agents Wang Shunqing, Wang Futian, Wei Shixi, Wang Jiadi, and others who had returned from specialized training in Tokyo were assigned to serve as regimental commanders and battalion commanders in various concentration camps. The company and platoon commanders were also all agents. Special executioner P.G. (short for Prisoner of war guard) – guards were organized in each regiment and battalion to beat and kill people. The U.S. military gave the agents and P.G. members the right to beat, scold, punish, and even kill the prisoners of war. Each platoon also had a "reporter" who specialized in reporting the "ideological situation" of the prisoners of war. The prisoners of war were not allowed to talk to each other, and even urination and defecation had to be approved and a license was required.

In early September 1951, the U.S. Military Police Headquarters instigated agents Wei Shixi, Li Daan, Wang Youmin, and others to begin a "tattooing campaign," forcing prisoners of war to tattoo "anti-communist and anti-Russian" characters on their arms. The enemy claimed that those who had tattoos could eat "big bowls of rice" and would not be monitored...etc. But no one wanted to get a tattoo. In October, when the U.S. military police team came to inspect the tattoo results and take pictures, a U.S. military officer nicknamed "Pockmarked Face Captain" from the C.I.C. agency stationed on the island got very angry and ordered the agents in the prisoner-of-war camp to immediately take effective measures to achieve results. Since then, all those who expressed their unwillingness to get tattoos have been severely beaten one after another. Of the more than 6,000 people who were repatriated, none had not been tortured for refusing to get tattoos. Jiang Chengyuan (prisoner number 716219), who the enemy called Zhang Chengyuan, was beaten eleven times for refusing to get a tattoo. The enemy first called him to the battalion headquarters, where Dai Ruixiang, who claimed to have been a Chiang Kai-shek bandit major company commander, talked to him, asking him to "bow his head to the Three Principles of the People" and get a tattoo quickly. Jiang Chengyuan resolutely stated: "I am Chinese in life and a Chinese ghost in death. I will not be a traitor!" The agents immediately pushed him to the ground, and a beating with sticks knocked him unconscious. He was beaten for several days, but he always said: "My parents are in China, where else can I go if not back to China?" Finally, the enemy filled his mouth with a towel and beat him until he couldn't struggle anymore. Then the agents forcibly tattooed the four characters "anti-communist and anti-Russian" on his body. Jiang Chengyuan shouted hoarsely: "You tattooed my flesh, but you can't tattoo my heart!" The enemy slapped his face with a belt, swelling his entire face until his mouth could not open and he could not see. There are still scars all over his face. But he was still determined to return to the motherland and not go to Taiwan. Seeing that he was still not convinced after getting the tattoo, the enemy stripped him naked and hung him in a room with two other captured personnel who had suffered the same beating. He was only released after a week. After Jiang Chengyuan dragged his blood-stained body back, the first thing he did was find a razor blade to scrape off the tattooed characters on his body. His fellow prisoners saw that he was in poor health and advised him not to scrape it off for the time being, saying, "If you scrape it off, the enemy will tattoo it on you again." He said, "Having these characters on my body is more painful than anything else." He gritted his teeth and scraped it off himself. He fainted after scraping off only two characters. After his fellow prisoners woke him up, he continued to scrape and told the other fellow prisoners: "If you are my comrades, scrape it all off for me while I faint again." He also said: "I am prepared to endure more pain for my unchangeable will."

Li Jinchuan, who was 21 years old, was dragged to the torture chamber and beaten with tent poles because he insisted on not getting a tattoo. Eighteen tent poles were broken, and there was no good piece of meat on his body. He was tortured in this torture chamber for more than a month.

There are many more examples like Jiang Chengyuan and Li Jinchuan. The enemy tattooed the characters, and they scraped them off. After scraping, they tattooed them again, and then scraped them off again. Some were tattooed more than four times, and their arms were covered with scars. Some did not scrape them off, but cut open their own flesh and applied some medicinal powder to slowly rot the piece of meat with the characters.

"Scraping characters" was called "washing away shame" in the prisoner-of-war camp. Many people cursed the enemy while scraping. Many people sang the national anthem of the motherland to resist the pain.

On a rainy night, four prisoners of war from the 72nd Regiment who had been beaten half to death for refusing to get tattoos were dragged back to their tents. They were extremely angry and wrote "I am Chinese," "I want to return to the motherland," "Long live China," and "Long live Chairman Mao" in blood on a white shirt they had left behind when they were captured. These four comrades were strangled to death by the enemy that night. The next day, the enemy hung their bodies outside the tent and told all the prisoners of war that this was an example of those who firmly opposed getting tattoos.

Li Huaijin, who was detained in the ninth platoon of the second battalion of Concentration Camp No. 86, committed suicide by hanging himself on the night of December 21, 1951, because he could not bear the torture. After Jiang Guobin was beaten unconscious, the enemy tattooed characters on his body. After he woke up, he first used a razor blade to scrape off the characters, and then used the razor blade to cut his own throat and died.

Li Changshun (prisoner number 712046), who was captured on the battlefield because of a severe injury to his right hand, had his right hand sawed off by the enemy, but the wound was not stitched. The enemy said: "The wound will be stitched when you get the tattoo." He resolutely refused to get a tattoo, and the arm of the hand that was sawn off slowly ulcerated and eventually rotted away. There are many similar situations in the Busan concentration camp, which is known as a "prisoner-of-war sanatorium."

Nearly one-tenth of the seriously wounded and sick personnel of the Volunteer Army who were repatriated last time became seriously wounded, sick, or disabled because of this tattoo torture.

By January 1952, approximately 3,000 people in Concentration Camp No. 72 had been forcibly tattooed in this way. Nearly a thousand people in Concentration Camp No. 86 had also been tattooed. At this time, the enemy's shameless nonsense such as "voluntary repatriation" and "no forced repatriation" was shouted even louder at the negotiating table in Panmunjom.

However, the enemy was still not sure whether they could achieve the goal of forcibly detaining our captured personnel. Moran, a person in charge of the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp, told a reporter from the United Press on January 21st, "You can only split their (referring to the tattooed prisoners of war) heads open to know what they are thinking now."

Therefore, the enemy came up with another method, which was to force the prisoners of war to write blood oaths, dye blood flags, and "sign petitions" in the name of the prisoners of war, asking not to be "forcibly" repatriated and requesting to be sent to Taiwan. This was done in two ways.

First, the enemy dragged the prisoners of war to be severely tortured. If they were beaten unconscious, the agents would use their own fingers to dip into the victims' blood, write the characters, and apply blood fingerprints; or they would point a knife at your chest and force you to sign your name; but this method was still not effective quickly enough, so the enemy adopted another method: simply let the agents take care of everything. Gao Zhongen, an agent in the twelfth platoon of the fourth battalion of the 72nd Regiment, said himself that he signed thirteen people's names in one day. As a result, a petition written in blood with three hundred people's blood signatures and a blood flag appeared. They were handed over to the U.S. military police lieutenant colonel on Geoje Island, who then forwarded them to Li Qiqiai. Agents Wang Jiadi and Liu Chenghan, who participated in this criminal incident, also confessed to these facts after being captured by our army after parachuting behind enemy lines.

The brutal "tattooing campaign" continued until March 1952. Most of the prisoners of war detained in Concentration Camps No. 86 and No. 72 (approximately 15,000 people, accounting for the vast majority of captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army) under the control of agent violence were forced to get tattoos. By April, the enemy had no time to force the tattoos one by one, so they branded the characters on their arms with red-hot iron bars. The remaining small number of people who did not have tattoos had to be "jointly guaranteed." The enemy believed that if one person had a problem, the entire guarantee would suffer.

At this time, all the enemy's propaganda organs clamored that these people could not be repatriated and would be sent to Taiwan to be handed over to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Wang Shunqing, Ying Xiangyun, Wang Futian, and other agent leaders of the prisoner-of-war camp, under the instructions of the U.S. military authorities, also openly declared to our captured personnel in a smug manner: Tokyo has promised them that they will be company commanders if they take away (referring to taking to Taiwan) one hundred people, battalion commanders if they take away five hundred people, and division commanders if they take away ten thousand people.

The enemy further threatened the tattooed personnel, saying: "The United Nations Army hates fickle villains the most. You have all been tattooed, and if you change your mind again, you will never be tolerated." "You have all been tattooed and have become traitors to the Communist Party. If you return to the Communist Party, the Communist Party will definitely kill you!" "You have all been tattooed, what face do you have to see your family members? Go to Taiwan with us and counterattack the mainland in the future is the only way out!"

On April 5, 1952, the staff meeting of the fourth item on the agenda of the Panmunjom negotiations on the repatriation of prisoners of war was adjourned for two weeks.

On April 6, the spokesperson of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army and the Command of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army was ordered to issue an important statement on the issue of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the Korean armistice. This statement clearly pointed out that under the enemy's cruel persecution and massacre of prisoners of war, our captured personnel were forced to tattoo reactionary characters on their bodies or write reactionary blood oaths. These behaviors were not voluntary and they were not responsible for them; and expressed welcome to all captured personnel to return to participate in the cause of peaceful construction and live a peaceful life.

But on this April 6th, the U.S. aggressors took advantage of the two-week adjournment of the staff meeting of the fourth item on the agenda to begin illegal and more barbaric so-called "review and screening" of our captured personnel.

At about 1:00 p.m. that day, U.S. Colonel Bear represented Todd, the commander-in-chief of prisoners of war, at the 72nd Regiment headquarters to convene a meeting of representatives from various concentration camps on the island, claiming that the U.S. military would implement "review and screening" of all prisoners of war in the next two or three days. On the spot, Sun Zhenguan, the representative of Concentration Camp No. 71, immediately spoke out against this conspiracy. The enemy colonel simply ignored it, and the meeting was adjourned in less than twenty minutes.

In the afternoon, the enemy conducted deceptive propaganda in various concentration camps, saying that the U.S. military had allowed all prisoners of war to be sent to Taiwan, and those who did not want to go would still be detained in concentration camps. Everyone should be careful during the "screening"...

At the same time, all the military police, agents, and guards on Geoje Island were mobilized and formed a huge assassination group, each equipped with a sharp knife about one foot long with the letters "U.S." on the handle. The U.S. military also increased its troops and posts and brought in a large number of tanks. That night, U.S. military chaplain Woodbury came forward to convene a meeting of agents to arrange the "screening" and arrange the massacre of those who demanded repatriation. This agent chaplain Woodbury, who was called "Wild Mouse" by the prisoners of war, claimed to be the head of the U.S. Eighth Army chaplain, had "preached" in Qingdao, Shanghai, and other places in China for more than 20 years, and had "deep friendship" with the Chinese people; he left China for the United States in 1947, came to Korea with the U.S. military to invade Korea in 1950, spoke broken Chinese, was in his fifties, and had a mustache. When he came to "preach" to the prisoners of war, he would say: "You are all sinners of God, and God punishes you to suffer in concentration camps..." The prisoners of war hated him to the bone.

On April 7, the shocking "screening" massacre began. Before the individual "review," the enemy first divided all the prisoners of war into battalions (each battalion had approximately one thousand people) and took them away. The surrounding area was full of agents holding knives, and the outer circle had American soldiers with machine guns set up. The agents first intimidated them for a while, and then asked the prisoners of war to express their attitude. Whoever said they would not go to Taiwan would be beaten on the spot. There were 1,300 people in the third battalion of the 72nd Regiment, and 78 people were pulled out on the spot. The enemy asked them where they wanted to go, and they firmly stated that they wanted to return to the mainland. The enemy immediately tied them up and first said to 25 of them who had tattoos: "You were captured by the United Nations Army, and the Americans didn't kill you, but you are still thinking about the Communist Party..." As he spoke, he stripped a captured person named Qi of his shirt, grabbed his tattooed arm, and cut off a piece of flesh more than five inches long with a knife. Then, none of the 25 people were spared, and all of them had their flesh cut off. The agents strung the cut-off pieces of flesh together and paraded them in public. Those who did not have tattoos but insisted on returning to the motherland were beaten with sticks, and blood flowed all over the ground. At this time, ten of these 78 people did not dare to say that they wanted to return to the mainland. But the remaining 68 people still insisted on returning to the mainland. The enemy imprisoned them in the toilet. They were pulled out again to be beaten after dusk. Finally, 55 people remained who still firmly demanded repatriation and were tightly bound and imprisoned.

The situation in other battalions was similar. For example, more than 80 people were pulled out of the fifth battalion, and more than 30 people had their flesh cut off. More than 100 people were pulled out of the first battalion, and more than 10 people had their flesh cut off.

On the evening of April 7, Li Daan, a loyal lackey of the U.S. military and an agent, led a large number of agents to various battalions to inspect. When he arrived at the first battalion, without saying a word, he pulled out Liu Botao, who was 18 years old, and cut his arm with a knife, exposing the white bone. This young child fainted on the spot. At this time, Li Daan burned the piece of human flesh on a lamp and put it in his bloody mouth to eat it. While eating, he said: "The Americans and I will have a meal tomorrow and eat human flesh dumplings. The Americans said that you have eaten the United Nations Army's food for so long, and you have to leave your flesh behind before you leave."

On the same night, the enemy continued to torture those captured personnel on our side who firmly demanded repatriation, concentrating more than 700 prisoners of war in a tin house called the "Freedom Auditorium"—which was usually used by U.S. military chaplains to preach the "Bible" and Chiang Kai-shek "instructors" to teach reactionary lessons, but now it has become a killing field. It was drizzling outside, the sky was dark, and the lights in the auditorium were very dim. Hundreds of agents and guards with knives and sticks had already been deployed. A large number of U.S. military police patrolled outside the auditorium. More than 700 people were brought in batches, and they were not allowed to look up. Each batch that was brought in was beaten until they could not move. After they were all brought in, there was another collective beating. The ground was covered with blood, and the blood splattered on the images of Jesus and Truman hanging on the surrounding walls.

The agents pulled out Lin Xuefu, a prisoner of war from the second battalion, stripped him naked, and interrogated him personally by the agent leader Wang Shunqing. Every time he asked a question, he would stab Lin Xuefu with a knife, but Lin Xuefu's shouts became louder and louder: "Resolutely return to the motherland!" "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" After more than ten stabs, Lin Xuefu continued to shout. The bandits were furious and helpless, so they stabbed him randomly all over his body, stabbing him more than thirty times. Comrade Xuefu did not finish his last slogan and died tragically under the random knives of the agents. Then, Li Fei Daan went up and used a knife to dig out Lin Xuefu's heart and picked it on the tip of the knife and howled to the more than 700 victims: "See clearly? This is an example of those who want to return to the mainland. Tomorrow's screening, whoever says they want to return to the mainland again, I'll see if his heart is red or black first..."

In the fourth battalion, which was called the officer battalion, the enemy pulled out more than 120 people who firmly wanted to return to the motherland. They were tortured one by one. The torture site was the teacher's room of the enemy CIE school. Li Guohua, the representative of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits stationed in the concentration camp, and Lu Lu, the secretary-general of the Chiang Kai-shek Geoje Island "June 3" branch, personally interrogated them. Comrade Yang Wenhua was beaten by the agents from his heels upwards with iron rods. After more than one hundred blows, he died on the spot. Then, his heart was also dug out. At this time, the sky was already bright, and a U.S. military police captain and a major walked in, raised their thumbs, nodded, and said two "OKs" in unison! Several photos were taken.

That night, Geoje Island was filled with screams of torture. In Concentration Camp No. 86, more than 30 people were buried alive in sacks that night and buried under the barbed wire. Comrade Qi Zhongtang and others from the sixth battalion of this concentration camp were strangled to death in a tent called the drama class. Tortures that were difficult for humans to imagine, such as hanging upside down, stringing fingers together, pouring kerosene into the mouth and burning them alive, steaming them alive in steamers, boiling them to death with boiling water, and other American "civilized" tortures, were all used on those who firmly demanded to return to the motherland.

According to the statistics witnessed by the captured personnel (which are of course extremely incomplete), 97 people were killed in this massacre; more than 300 people had their flesh cut off; more than 340 people were seriously injured; and more than a thousand people were slightly injured.

After such a "demonstration" of suppression, the official individual "screening review" began early in the morning on the 8th.

First, all the captured personnel were concentrated outside the tents, and the human flesh and hearts that had been cut off the night before were put in basins, strung with ropes, and "exhibited" and "paraded" in front of all the captured personnel: "Look! These are the people who firmly demand to return to Communist China!"

Individual "review and screening" was conducted as follows. On the morning of April 8, the enemy deployed approximately two battalions of troops around the concentration camp, set up machine guns in front of each bunker, and brought in many tanks and armored vehicles, aiming their guns at the prisoners of war. A tall screen was set up in the concentrated square, divided into ten compartments, which were the interrogation rooms. The captured personnel were taken into the interrogation room one by one to be interrogated individually. At the exit of the screen, there were two roads: one leading to the gate, which was the road for those who insisted on repatriation; the other leading to the original barbed wire fence, which was the road for those who were so-called "refusing repatriation." At the intersection of the road leading to the gate, there were many agents and guards holding knives and sticks, plus a U.S. military police squad. Everyone who firmly demanded repatriation during the "review" had to break through this road.

The first batch to be screened and reviewed was the 86th Regiment. The first three captured personnel holding certificates with return symbols from the interrogation room were knocked down on the spot on this road. Later, none of those who rushed out were not stabbed or beaten with sticks. Many of those who were injured yesterday were unable to rush out and were dragged back into the original barbed wire fence. Under such individual "screening and review," of course, the vast majority of people had no way to rush out. In total, only more than 1,100 people rushed out of the 8,400 people in the 86th Regiment.

At 3:00 p.m. that day, all 230 people in the 71st Regiment collectively opposed the "screening" and all demanded repatriation to the motherland. American soldiers opened fire and injured Ren Guiquan, Sun Changqing, Wu Zhongxiao, and three others.

The next day (9th), the enemy used more cruel methods to "screen" the 72nd Regiment. Shi Zhenqing, the first person to walk on the road of firm repatriation, was stabbed to death at the intersection by the agents. On this day, only more than 700 people rushed out of the 7,700 people in the 72nd Regiment. When they rushed through that life-and-death road and got on the trucks, everyone clearly saw those who were forced back into the original barbed wire fence by violence, the so-called "refusing repatriation" people. They waved, cried, and screamed to those who got on the trucks, trying desperately to grab the barbed wire fence and rush out. But the agents' knives and sticks beat them back. The American military police nodded and grinned.

Those who escaped the tiger's mouth were detained by the enemy in Concentration Camp No. 602 on Geoje Island at that time. Later, after repeated protests, the U.S. side agreed to conduct a second "screening" on some of the people who remained in the original concentration camp on April 22. Before the second "screening," the people being "screened" were concentrated in the "Freedom Auditorium" where Lin Xuefu was killed. U.S. military chaplain Woodbury spread rumors to the public and warned: "Those who have been tattooed and firmly demand to leave here for repatriation, more than 300 people have been killed by a group of Communist activists who rushed out together, and more than 60 heads are hanging on the barbed wire. For the sake of God, those of you who have been tattooed, don't firmly demand repatriation again. Those who rush out will be shot to death by American machine guns in the future." The enemy's second "screening" of the prisoners of war was obviously conducted under the same terror. Therefore, only 600 people rushed out in total in the second time.

The U.S. invading army blocked the news of this massacre for forty-four days. It was not revealed by Reuters until May 20. But the number of people killed was greatly reduced, saying that less than 100 people were killed or injured in total.

Around May 20, the enemy also conducted the same screening massacre in the concentration camp in Busan called the "prisoner-of-war sanatorium." More than 120 of our captured personnel were killed.

Later, the enemy concentrated all the approximately 5,000 people who firmly demanded repatriation in Concentration Camp No. 602 and moved them to Jeju Island in early July last year, detaining them in Prisoner-of-War Camp No. 8. These are the people who have now been repatriated and returned.

Those who were unable to express their true will under the enemy's violence, approximately 14,000 people in total, were moved by the enemy to Jeju Island in late April and detained in Prisoner-of-War Camp No. 2. This is the concentration camp that the enemy calls "refusing repatriation."

    归来的我方被俘人员的控诉
    吴明
    八月五日到九月六日，敌我双方进行了应予直接遣返的战俘的遣返工作。现在，我志愿军被俘人员已有六千多名返回祖国怀抱，但仍有约一万四千名不能直接遣返。这就是敌人所谓“不愿遣返”的战俘。这一万四千名左右所谓“不愿遣返”的战俘究竟是怎么回事呢？这可以从归来的被俘人员的控诉材料中看得很明白。
    一九五二年四月敌人对战俘的“甄别”大屠杀前，我志愿军被俘人员绝大部分囚禁在巨济岛——这个不满三百平方公里的“死亡岛”上。其囚禁情形大致是这样：第八十六号集中营约八千四百余人，第七十二号集中营约七千七百余人，第七十号集中营约一千五百余人，第七十一号集中营约二百三十余人，第六十一号集中营（即所谓战犯集中营）约百余人；每一集中营被称做一个联队，下辖大、中、小队。其他被俘人员分别集中在釜山、马山等地。
    这些集中营都设置在空旷地上，周围有六道通有电流的高大铁丝网，铁丝网内外碉堡林立，四周站满了持枪实弹的美国兵，并经常有坦克、装甲车往返巡逻，戒备极其森严。入夜，敌人巨大的探照灯在我方被俘人员住的帐篷上来回照射，血红的曳光弹不时从被俘人员的头上掠过，军用狼犬发出骇人的嚎叫。在铁丝网内还密布着许多敌人的警备队员，我方被俘人员不得随便走动一步。到处都可以听到酷刑下的惨叫和呻吟，每个被俘人员随时都可以被拉出去秘密讯问。恐怖笼罩着这个小岛。
    被俘人员都挤在一排肮脏阴暗的铁皮营房，或五六十个人挤在一个帐篷里。里面仅铺有永远也不更换的腐烂了的稻草，潮湿异常；夏不遮雨，冬不挡风。
    被俘人员每人每天只能吃到两小军用碗粗糙的高粱米或大麦和一点盐水萝卜汤。天不明，就被赶起来做苦工。没有苦工时就勒令砸石块，砸碎了往海里填。或者去挖土坑，前边的人挖，后边的人填。
    第七十一号集中营全体被俘人员在一九五一年十二月十二日致该战俘营美军总管雷孟德·劳代大尉的通知书中曾这样写着：“我们被俘以来从没有吃过一顿饱饭。在这严寒的冬天，还让我们穿着几件单衣和一条单裤，全体被俘人员都患着严重的营养不良症，百分之八十以上的人冻坏了腿或患着其他的疾病……。”
    敌人经常把被俘人员押去听反动课。上课时四周站满了持棍提刀的敌方特务，任何人不准动。被俘人员对这反动课稍表厌倦即遭毒打，七十二联队一大队三小队的五十余人都在“听课”时挨过打。四大队的李德才及魏林，因听课后拒绝发表反共言论，被打四十余棍，罚“爬下”两个小时。
    一九五一年七月，朝鲜停战谈判开始后，敌人为了强迫扣留我被俘人员，曾从台湾陆续调来一百五十余名“具有经验”的蒋匪特务（通过蒋匪驻釜山大使馆大使王匪东原派来的），分别在巨济岛各战俘营担任“教官”和其他职务。七月下旬，从东京受专门训练回来的特务王顺清、王福田、魏世喜、王家悌等人，被指派担任各集中营的联队长、大队长。中、小队长也全部由特务担任。各联队、大队组织了专门打人杀人的刽子手P．G（即Prisonerof　war　guard之缩写）——警备队。各级特务队长及P．G队员由美军赋予对战俘实行打骂刑罚以至杀戮之权。各小队还设有“反映员”，专门反映战俘的“思想情况”。被俘人员个人之间不准谈话，连大小便都要经批准领牌。
    一九五一年九月初，美方宪兵司令部即唆使特务魏世喜、李大安、王有敏等开始进行“刺字运动”，强迫在战俘膀臂上刺“反共抗俄”等字样。敌人宣称：刻了字可以吃“大碗饭”，刻了字不受监视……等等。但没有人愿意刺字。十月间，美军宪兵队来检查刺字成绩并照相时，C．I．C驻岛上机关的一个外号“麻脸上尉”的美军军官大发脾气，限令战俘营的特务立刻采取有效措施弄出成绩来。此后，所有表示不愿刺字的人都先后遭到毒打。
    十一月末，板门店停战谈判快要进入战俘遣返问题的第四项议程时，美军总司令李奇微突然来到巨济岛“视察”战俘营。李奇微“视察”之后，巨济岛各战俘营的美军宪兵、特务、警备队马上忙乱起来。他们公开宣称，刻字要挨个进行，谁也不能避免。接着，每天都有成批的人被提往大队部、联队部或专门刑讯战俘的酷刑室去拷打刺字。被遣返归来的六千余人，没有一个不因拒绝刻字而受过酷刑。被敌人叫成张成元的姜成元（俘号七一六二一九），因拒绝刻字挨过十一次打。敌人最初把他叫到大队部，由一个自称当过蒋匪少校连长的戴瑞祥跟他谈话，要他“向三民主义低头”，赶快刺字。姜成元坚决表示：“我生是中国人，死是中国鬼，我不当叛徒！”特务马上将他按倒在地，一顿棍棒将他打得晕死过去。一连打了几天，但他始终表示：
  “我父母在中国，不回中国回那里？”最后敌人用手巾填上他的嘴，将他打得不能挣扎了，然后由特务们把“反共抗俄”四字强刺在他身上。姜成元声嘶力竭地喊着：“你们刺了我的肉，刺不了我的心！”敌人用皮带抽打他的脸，打得嘴张不开了，眼看不见了，全脸都肿了，至今仍伤痕斑斑。但他仍坚决要回祖国，不去台湾。敌人见刺了字他还不服，就把他剥光衣服，和另外两个遭受同样毒打的被俘人员悬在一间屋子里。一星期以后才被放回来。姜成元拖着沾满血的身体回来后，第一件事情就是找了个刀片刮身上被刺的字。难友们见他身体不好，劝他暂时不要刮，说：“你刮了敌人还要给你刺。”他说：“身上带着这些字，比什么都痛苦。”他咬着牙自己刮。才刮去两个字就晕倒了。难友们救醒他以后，他继续刮，并告诉其他难友：“是我的同志，就趁我再晕过去的时候替我全部刮去。”又说：“我为了我不可更改的意志，还准备忍受更多的痛苦。”
    二十一岁的李金川因坚持不让刺字，敌人把他拉到酷刑室用帐篷杆打他，打断十八根帐篷杆，全身没有一块好肉了。在这个酷刑室里，他受了一个多月的刑。
    像姜成元、李金川这样的例子还很多，敌人刺了字，他们刮，刮了再刺，刺了再刮，有的竟被刺字到四次以上，臂膀被刺得全是伤疤。有的不刮，就割开自己皮肉敷上些药粉，使那块带字的肉慢慢地烂掉。
    “刮字”在战俘营称为“洗辱”。许多人一边刮、一边痛骂敌人。许多人为了抗御疼痛，就高唱祖国国歌。
    在一个风雨交集的夜晚，七十二联队有四个因不肯刺字而被打得半死的被俘人员被拖回帐篷。他们愤怒极了，在自己被俘时所留下的一件白衬衣上用血写上了“我是中国人”、“我要回祖国”、“中国人万岁”、“毛主席万岁”。这四位同志当夜就被敌人勒死了。第二天，敌人把他们的尸体悬在帐篷外，告诉所有的战俘，说这就是坚决反对刺字的人的榜样。
    被拘禁在第八十六号集中营二大队九小队的李怀金，因不堪酷刑的折磨，于一九五一年十二月二十一日夜上吊自杀了。江国斌被打昏以后，敌人在他身上刺了字。他醒后首先用刀片将字刮去，然后就用这个刀片割断了自己的喉管死去了。
    在战场上因右手重伤而被俘的李昌顺（俘号七一二○四六），敌人将他的右手锯掉了，但不缝伤口。敌人说：“什么时候刺了字，什么时候缝伤口。”他坚决不刺，那只被锯掉手的臂就慢慢溃烂起来，一直好几个月，最后连右臂也烂掉了。这种情形，在被称为“战俘休养所”的釜山集中营还有很多。
    上次被遣返归来的志愿军重伤病人员，有将近十分之一是因为这种刺字的摧残而成为重伤病或残废的。
    到一九五二年一月，第七十二号集中营有三千左右的人就这样被强迫刺了字。第八十六号集中营也有近千的人被刺了字。这时，在板门店的谈判桌上，敌方的所谓“自愿遣返”、“不强迫遣返”等无耻滥言就叫喊得更厉害了。
    但是，敌人对于究竟能否达到强迫扣留我被俘人员的目的，仍然没有确切的把握。巨济岛战俘营的一个负责人摩兰一月二十一日苦恼地对合众社记者说：“你只有把他们（指刺了字的被俘人员）的脑袋劈开，才能知道他们现在是怎样想的。”
    于是，敌人又想出另一套办法，即强迫被俘人员写血书、染血旗，并假冒被俘人员的名义“签名呈请”不要“强迫”遣返，要求把他们送到台湾。这是采取两个办法进行的。
    首先，敌人把被俘人员拉去严刑拷打。打昏了，特务们就用自己的手指蘸着被害者的鲜血，写成字，涂上血指印；或者是用刀尖对着你的胸口，威逼你签上名字；但这种办法收效仍不迅速，敌人就采用另一种办法：干脆由特务包办代替。七十二联队四大队十二小队一个名叫高忠恩的特务，他自己说他一天之中就代签了十三个人名。于是，一份用血写成的有三百个人签了血名的呈请书和一面血旗就出现了。它们被交给巨济岛美军宪兵中校，再由他转呈李奇微。曾参与这次罪恶事件的特务王家悌、刘承汉等，后来在空降我军后方被俘后，也供认了这些事实。
    残暴的“刺字运动”一直进行到一九五二年三月。拘禁在特务暴力控制下的第八十六号及第七十二号集中营的被俘人员（约共一万五千余人，占中国人民志愿军被俘人员的绝大多数），大多数都被迫刺上了字。到四月份，敌人已来不及强迫一针一针的刻刺，便用烧红了的铁条在臂上烙字。剩下一少部分没有刺字的人，都必须“连环保”。敌人认为那一个人有问题，全保都遭殃。
    这时候，敌人所有的宣传机关都叫嚣起来，说这些人将不能被遣返，而要把他们送到台湾交给蒋匪。战俘营的特务头子王顺清、应祥云、王福田等，在美军当局的指示下，也得意忘形地公开向我被俘人员宣称：东京已许诺了他们：带走（指带到台湾）百人当连长，带走五百人当营长，带走万人当师长。
    敌人更进一步地威吓被刺了字的人员，说：“联合国军最忌恨反复无常的小人。你们都刺了字，要是再生二心，就绝不相容。”“你们都刺了字，都成了共产党的叛徒，要再回共产党，共产党一定要杀你们的头！”“你们都刺了字，现在有什么脸面去见你们家里的人？好好地跟我们去台湾，将来反攻大陆才是出路！”

    一九五二年四月五日起，板门店谈判战俘遣返的第四项议程参谋会议休会两周。
    四月六日，朝鲜人民军最高司令部及中国人民志愿军司令部发言人奉命对朝鲜停战后释放并遣返全部战俘问题发表了一个重要声明。这个声明明确地指出，在敌人对战俘残酷迫害与屠杀之下，我被俘人员曾被迫在身上刺下反动字样或被迫写下反动血书，这些行为并非出于战俘自愿，不能由他们负责；并表示欢迎全体被俘人员回来参加和平建设事业，过和平生活。
    但是就在这个四月六日，美国侵略者利用第四项议程参谋会议休会两周的时间，对我被俘人员开始了非法的更加野蛮残暴的所谓“审查甄别”。
    这一天的午后一时左右，美军百尔上校代表战俘总管杜德在七十二联队部召集岛上各集中营代表开会，宣称美军将于最近两三日内，对所有的战俘实行“审查甄别”。当场第七十一号集中营代表孙振冠即发言反对这个阴谋，敌上校根本不予理睬，会议开了不到二十分钟即宣布散会。
    下午，敌人在各集中营分别进行欺骗宣传，说美军已允许将所有的战俘送往台湾，不愿去的仍要拘禁在集中营，“甄别”时大家当心点……。
    同时，巨济岛上所有的宪兵、特务、警备队员全体总动员，组成了庞大的暗杀团，每人皆佩有一把柄上有“U．S．”字样、长约一尺的尖刀。美国军队也增兵加岗，并开来大批坦克。当晚由美军随军牧师伍伯里出面召集特务们开会布置“甄别”的进行，布置对要求遣返者的屠杀。这个被战俘们称为
  “野鼠”的特务牧师伍伯里自称是美第八军上校牧师头，曾在中国青岛、上海等地“传教”二十余年，和中国人民有“深厚的友谊”；一九四七年离华返美，一九五○年随侵朝美军来朝鲜，会讲不流利的中国话，五十余岁，八字胡。平时来向战俘们“传教”时就讲：“你们都是上帝的罪人，上帝罚你们在集中营受苦难……。”战俘们恨之入骨。
    四月七日，骇人听闻的“甄别”大屠杀开始了。在个别“审查”前，敌人先把所有被俘人员分成大队（每大队约有千余人）带开，周围布满了持刀的特务，外圈有架好机枪的美国兵。特务们先恫吓一阵，然后要战俘表示态度。谁表示不到台湾，就当场棒打。七十二联队三大队有一千三百人，当场拉出来七十八人。敌人问他们愿到那里，他们坚决表示要回祖国大陆。敌人马上将他们捆绑起来，首先对其中二十五个刺了字的人说：“你们被联合国军俘来，美国人不杀你们，你们还想着共产党……。”说着就将一个姓齐的被俘人员剥光了上衣，拖住他那刺了字的臂膀，一刀割下五寸多长的一块肉。接着，二十五人无一幸免，全被割了肉。特务们把割下的肉用绳子串起来示众。那些没有刺字而要求坚决回祖国的，都遭受了棒打，打得遍地血流。这时这七十八人中有十个不敢说要回大陆了。但其余六十八人仍坚持回大陆。敌人便把他们拘禁在厕所里。黄昏后又拉出来打。最后剩下五十五个人仍然坚决要求遣返，都被捆得紧紧地禁闭起来。
    其他各大队的情形也和这差不多。如五大队拉出来八十余人，被割肉的三十余人。一大队被拉出百余人，割肉的十余人。
    四月七日晚，美军忠实走狗、特务李大安率领大批特务去各大队检查。到一大队时，二话没说，就将十八岁的刘伯涛拉出来，一刀把臂膀上割得露出了白骨头。这个年青的孩子当时就晕倒了。李大安此时把那块人肉在灯上一烧，就放进自己的血嘴里吃起来。边吃边说：“美国人和我明天会餐，要吃人肉饺子。美国人说，你们吃了联合国军这样长时间的饭，要走得先把肉给留下。”
    同日晚，敌人继续摧残那些坚决要求遣返的我方被俘人员，把七百多名战俘集中在一个被称为“自由大礼堂”的铁皮房子里——平时这里是美军牧师讲“圣经”和蒋匪“教官”讲反动课的地方，现在这里成了杀人的屠场。外面下着细雨，天黑沉沉地，大礼堂内灯光很昏暗，早就布好了数百个持刀提棍的特务和警备队员。美国大批的宪兵巡逻在礼堂外面。七百多人被分批带了进来，都不准抬头。带进一批打一批，打到不能动弹为止。都带进来以后，又来了一阵集体乱打。地上流满了血，血溅在四围墙壁上挂着的耶稣像和杜鲁门像上。
      特务们把二大队的战俘林学甫拉了出来，剥光衣服，由特务头子王顺清亲自审问。每问一句就在林学甫身上刺一刀，但林学甫的喊声愈来愈高：“坚决要回祖国！”“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”刺到十余刀后，林学甫仍继续高呼。匪徒们气疯了也没办法，就狠命在他身上乱刺，直刺了三十余刀。学甫同志最后的一句口号没有喊完，就惨死在特务们的乱刀之下了。然后，李匪大安上去用刀剜出林学甫的心，挑在刀尖上向七百多个受难的人嚎叫：“看清了没有？这就是你们要回大陆的榜样。明天甄别，那个再表示要回大陆，我先看看他的心是红的还是黑的……。”
    被称为军官大队的四大队，敌人拉出来一百二十余个坚决要回祖国的人。逐个拷打。拷打的地点是敌CIE学校的教员室。由蒋匪派在集中营的代表李国华、蒋匪巨济岛“六三”支部书记长卢路等亲自审问。杨文华同志被特务们从脚根挨着向上用铁棍打。打了一百多棍，当场毙命。然后，也被挖了心。这时天已大明，美军一个宪兵上尉和一个少校走进来，伸起大拇指，点着头，同声说了两个“OK”！照了几张像。
    这一夜，巨济岛上到处都是酷刑下的惨叫声。在第八十六号集中营，当夜被装入麻袋活埋的有三十余人，埋在铁丝网下。这个集中营第六大队的戚忠堂等同志被勒死在一个被称为戏剧班的帐篷里。人类所难于想像的酷刑，像倒悬、串指、火油灌口活活烧死，用蒸笼活活蒸死，沸水煮死等等美国的“文明”刑法，全部用到那些坚决要求回祖国的人身上了。
    据被俘人员所亲眼看到的统计（当然极不完全）这次惨遭杀死的有九十七人；被割肉的有三百余人；被打成重伤的有三百四十余人；轻伤在千人以上。
    经过这样的“示范”镇压之后，正式的个别的“甄别审查”在八日一早就开始了。
    先是将所有的被俘人员都集中在帐篷外，把昨夜割下的人肉和人心用盆盛着，用绳串着，在所有被俘人员面前来回的“展览”“示众”：“看看吧！这就是坚决要求回共产党中国去的人！”
    个别“审查、甄别”是这样进行的。四月八日晨，敌人在集中营的周围布置了约两个营的兵力，每个碉堡前都架好机枪，并开来许多辆坦克和装甲车，把炮口对准战俘。在集中的广场上，搭好了的高大的围幕，分成十个格间，这就是审查室。被俘人员一个个被带进审查室个别受审。在围幕的出口处有两条路：一条通向大门，是坚持遣返者走的路；另一条通向原来的铁丝网，即所谓“拒绝遣返”者走的路。在通大门的那条路口，站满了持刀提棍的特务和警备队，外加美军一个宪兵班。每个在“审查”时坚决要求遣返的人，都必须冲出这条路。
    第一批被甄别审查的是八十六联队。头三个手持着划了归国符号的证件从审查室出来的被俘人员，都在这条路上被当场打倒了。后来所有冲出来的人没有一个不遭到刀刺或棒打。许多昨天被打伤的人无力冲出，就被硬拖入原铁丝网。在这样个别“审查甄别”下，当然绝大部分人没有办法冲出来。总计八十六联队的八千四百多人，只冲出来一千一百多人。
    当日下午三时，七十一联队全体二百三十余人集体反对“甄别”，全部要求遣返回祖国。美国兵开枪打伤了任贵全、孙长青、吴忠孝等三人。
    第二天（九日），敌人用更加残忍的办法来“甄别”七十二联队。第一个走上坚决遣返那条路的石振青，被特务们乱刀杀死在路口上了。这一天，七十二联队的七千七百余人中仅有七百余人冲出。当他们冲过那段生死攸关的道路，上了大卡车的时候，每个人都清楚地看见了那些被暴力威逼着走回原铁丝网里的所谓“拒绝遣返”的人。他们向上了卡车的人挥手、哭喊、狂叫，拚命地抓铁丝网，想冲出来。但是，特务们的刀棒把他们打回去了。美国宪兵点着头、狞笑着。
    冲出虎口的人，被敌人拘禁在巨济岛当时的六○二号集中营。后来，经他们一再抗议，美方答应于四月二十二日对那些留在原集中营的一部分人进行第二次“甄别”。二次“甄别”前，被“甄别”的人集中在那个杀死林学甫的“自由大礼堂”里，美军的特务牧师伍伯里向大众造谣并警告说：“那些已经刺了字而又坚决离开这里要求遣返的人，被一块冲出去的共产党激烈分子杀死了三百多人，有六十多颗人头挂在铁丝网上，看上帝的面，你们这些刺了字的人再不要坚决遣返了。冲出去的人，将来美军都要用机枪把他们扫射死的。”敌人对战俘的第二次“甄别”，显然是在同样的恐怖下进行的。所以，第二次冲出来的总共只有六百人。
    美国侵略军对这次大屠杀事件，封锁消息达四十四天之久。到五月二十日才被路透社透露出来。但是将杀人的数字大大地缩小了，说打死打伤总共不到百人。
    五月二十日前后，在釜山被称为“战俘休养所”的集中营里，敌人也进行了同样的甄别屠杀。我被俘人员被杀害达一百二十余人。
    后来，敌人将所有坚决要求遣返的约共五千人都集中在第六○二号集中营，于去年七月初迁往济州岛，拘禁在第八号战俘营。这些就是现在已遣返归来的人。
    那些在敌人暴力下没有能表达自己真正意志的人，约共一万四千人，于四月下旬被敌迁往济州岛拘禁在第二号战俘营。这就是被敌人称为“拒绝遣返”的集中营。
