    Zhuang Farmers in Pinglu Township, Wuming County, Convert Large Amounts of Single-Crop Rice Fields to Double-Crop
    Xie Shixue of the CPC Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of Guangxi Province writes: Zhuang farmers in Pinglu Township, Wuming County, have increased grain production this year by converting large amounts of paddy fields from single-crop to double-crop.
    When the local people's government advocated planting double-crop rice, many Zhuang farmers had concerns. They said: We have been farming this land for decades and have never seen double-crop rice. If the early rice harvest is good, the late rice will definitely fail. In addition, there were three specific difficulties in converting to double-crop rice: a shortage of fertilizer (requiring twice as much fertilizer); a shortage of grain (converting to double-crop rice makes it impossible to plant early-maturing crops); and a shortage of labor (requiring twice as much labor). The CPC Pinglu Township Party Branch used the examples of labor model Huang Jinguang and farmer Huang Chaoxian, who planted double-crop rice last year and produced more grain, to conduct extensive publicity. It also solved the practical difficulties of fertilizer, grain, and labor shortages by helping Zhuang farmers find sources of fertilizer, advocating free lending, and organizing seasonal mutual aid groups. As a result, Zhuang farmers throughout the township converted 1,420 mu of land to double-crop rice. The early rice harvest was very good, totaling more than 640,000 catties, and the late rice will also have a bumper harvest.

### 武鸣县平陆乡僮族农民把大量一糙稻田改种二糙

专栏：读者来信摘要

    武鸣县平陆乡僮族农民把大量一糙稻田改种二糙
    中共广西省桂西僮族自治区委员会谢世学来信：武鸣县平陆乡僮族农民今年把大量的水田由种一糙改种两糙，增产了粮食。
    当地人民政府提倡种两糙时，很多僮族农民有顾虑。他们说：耕了几十年的田，还没有见过种二糙的。种了二糙，要是早糙收成好，晚糙一定失收。此外，改种二糙田又有三个具体困难：缺肥（肥料多用一倍）；缺粮（改种二糙，无法种早熟作物）；缺人力（人工多一倍）。中共平陆乡党支部就用劳动模范黄锦光和农民黄朝献去年改种两糙、多打粮食的例子，广泛进行了宣传。并用帮助僮族农民找肥源，提倡自由借贷和组织季节性互助组的办法，解决了缺肥、缺粮、缺人力的实际困难。因此，全乡僮族农民改种两糙的田有一千四百二十亩。早糙收成很好，共收了六十四万多斤，晚糙也将得到丰收。
