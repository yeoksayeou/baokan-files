Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: After the armistice, the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee gang continued to send special agents into northern Korea to carry out sabotage activities. However, these special agents have been captured by the highly vigilant Korean people.

	On September 22nd, the People's Self-Defense Force of Xin Fengli, Jin Gang County, Jiangyuan Province, near the front line, wiped out nine armed special agents, including Zhao Mingcai, sent by the 3519th unit of the US military's Far East Command, and seized seven rifles, one submachine gun, nine grenades, drugs for espionage activities, and 170,000 won of counterfeit North Korean currency.

	According to the confessions of these special agents, they used to be "security members" of the American-Syngman Rhee bandit army, assisting the bandit army in massacring patriots and innocent people, and plundering people's property. Later, they served as intelligence personnel for the Syngman Rhee army, receiving two years of training at a spy training center in Zhenling, Seoul, with American military advisors as instructors. On September 15th of this year, they were ordered to sneak into northern Korea, their mission being to disrupt the Republic's peaceful reconstruction work, attack the Labor Party and the Republic's political organs, and spy on military intelligence, especially to sabotage factories under restoration and construction. However, due to the Korean people's strict self-defense organization, this group of special agents failed to carry out sabotage activities after sneaking into northern Korea and were captured.

    朝鲜人民自卫队捕获一批美李武装特务
    【新华社平壤讯】美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮在停战后继续派遣特务潜入朝鲜北部进行破坏活动。但是这些特务已被保持高度警惕的朝鲜人民捕获。
    九月二十二日，靠近前线的江原道金刚郡新丰里的人民自卫队，将美军远东司令部所属三五一九部队派来的武装特务赵明才等九人一网打尽，并缴获了步枪七支、冲锋枪一支、手榴弹九枚、进行特务活动用的药品和伪造的朝鲜币十七万元。
    据这批特务供述，他们过去是美李匪军的“治安队员”，曾协助匪军屠杀爱国者和无辜人民，掠夺人民财物；后来他们充当李伪军的谍报工作人员，在汉城贞陵的间谍养成所受训两年，训练者有美军顾问。今年九月十五日，他们奉命潜入朝鲜北部，任务是破坏共和国的和平恢复工作，袭击劳动党与共和国政权机关，刺探军事情报，特别是要破坏正在恢复和建设的工厂。但是，由于朝鲜人民有着严密的自卫组织，这批特务在潜入朝鲜北部以后未能进行破坏活动，就被捕获。
