    The People's Republic of China Embarks on the Road to Development and Prosperity
    —"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Editorial
    October 1st is the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The great Chinese people are celebrating this memorable day in an atmosphere of unprecedented political and labor enthusiasm. The people of the Soviet Union, the working people of the People's Democracies of Europe and Asia, and all progressive humanity are celebrating the victory of People's China together with the Chinese people.
    The past four years have demonstrated to the world the great vitality and strength of the People's Republic of China. One of its great achievements is that the social and state system of the people's democratic dictatorship and its unbreakable foundation—the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class—have been consolidated in China. The fraternal friendship among the various nationalities of this multi-ethnic country is growing. Under the banner of the People's Democratic United Front, all democratic patriotic parties and groups have united more closely around the Chinese Communist Party, the inspirer and organizer of the Chinese people's victory. The preconditions have been created for the victorious implementation of the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. Material welfare is constantly improving, and the people's cultural level is rising.
    The international prestige of the People's Republic of China has greatly increased. Great China will never again be the target of aggression by aggressive forces or the object of imperialist exploitation. For the first time in its history, it has gained genuine sovereignty. The People's Republic of China is a new major power, which, together with all peace-loving forces, safeguards and consolidates the interests of peace and international security. Today, it is impossible to resolve international issues in the East, Asia, and the world without the participation of Great China. The People's Republic of China has become an international force that constitutes a powerful stabilizing factor in the Asia-Pacific region, preventing imperialists from arbitrarily enslaving the people of Asia and from recklessly pursuing policies aimed at turning Asia into a center of another world war.
    The great resurgence of the peoples of the East has become one of the most important characteristics of our era, opening up encouraging prospects for the further development of modern civilization as a whole. This great trend, and the results of New China's development over the past four years, provide an inspiring example to the world, proving that the liberated non-European nations, drawn by the great October Socialist Revolution onto the road of fighting for freedom and independence, for democracy and socialism, are as capable of developing civilization and culture as the European nations; this is completely contrary to the racist theories of the apologists for imperialism.
    The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, who went to the aid of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at a critical moment, consolidated the fraternal alliance and friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples with their immortal achievements and blood, and vividly demonstrated the unbreakable ties of the peoples of Asia. This proves that a new era is unfolding in the East, an era in which the peoples of Asia are determined to win and maintain their national freedom and independence. The development of the situation in Korea proves that the Chinese people have become a powerful fortress for the oppressed nations of the East in their struggle for freedom and independence.
    The Chinese people, filled with enthusiasm for building a happy new life, are advancing along the road of their noble cause, with the comprehensive, selfless help and support of all the people of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Soviet-Chinese friendship, which is consolidated year by year, is based on the common interests of the Soviet and Chinese peoples, on mutual respect for national sovereignty and independence, and on the solid foundation of their willingness to serve the cause of consolidating peace and strengthening international security. The sacred friendship of the peace-loving Soviet Union and the peace-loving People's Republic of China serves the great cause of peace in the Far East and the world. The Chinese people are enthusiastically studying and widely applying the advanced experience and the latest technological achievements of the Soviet Union. The comprehensive, long-term, and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union is of great significance for the recovery of the Chinese economy. Today, this assistance plays a very important role in building China's powerful heavy industry, in industrializing China, and in gradually transitioning China to socialism.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which invariably takes the invincible doctrine of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin as its guide to action, and the Chinese Central People's Government headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have, in a short period of time, restored the national economy that was destroyed by long-term war and the rule of the imperialist plunderers and their Kuomintang reactionary agents, and have surpassed the highest pre-war levels in industrial and agricultural production. New factories, mines, and oil wells have begun production. Thanks to the great land reform, the peasants have obtained land and have been forever freed from the oppression of landlords, which has been passed down for generations. The elimination of feudal landlords has opened up broad prospects for increasing agricultural productivity. Farmers are voluntarily embarking on the road of mutual aid and cooperation. Last year, the total output of grain crops exceeded the highest pre-war level by 16.9 percent, while the extremely important technical crop, cotton, exceeded the highest pre-war level by 50 percent. The number of cattle and sheep has also increased significantly. The welfare of the working people has also improved. Due to social and economic transformation and the economic achievements made, the real wages of workers in state-owned industrial enterprises at the beginning of this year increased by an average of 75 percent compared to 1949. Farmers' incomes have increased significantly. Taxes are being systematically reduced. In 1951, the taxes paid by farmers accounted for 17 percent of their income; last year, they accounted for only 12 percent of their income. However, under the rule of the Kuomintang, the taxes and rents paid by farmers accounted for three-quarters of their income, sometimes even reaching 90 percent.
    The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Central People's Government, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, are making every effort to improve the living standards of the working people. Millions of unemployed people have now found jobs. For the first time in Chinese history, social insurance, fixed rest days, and paid annual leave have been established. Hundreds of thousands of workers' families have moved into comfortable housing. Huge amounts of funds have been allocated for irrigation and soil improvement work. Medical services in cities and villages have greatly improved. A real cultural revolution is underway.
    This year, the Chinese people are completing the complex and arduous tasks of the first year of the First Five-Year Plan. The purpose of this Five-Year Plan is to establish a solid foundation for national industrialization and to ensure the continuous growth of socialist components in the national economy. The national economy is developing on a broad power base—thermal power stations and hydropower stations that are now under construction. This year, the amount of capital construction in industry will be 40 percent more than last year. While concentrating on developing heavy industry, the Chinese people are continuing to develop agriculture, light industry, the food industry, and all sectors of the national economy, making them suitable for the requirements of the objective laws of planned and proportional development of the national economy.
    The international reactionaries, headed by the American ruling clique, are extremely angry at the achievements of People's China and its growing influence on peaceful foreign policy. The imperialists are unwilling to lose their right to enslave and plunder the Chinese people. The American reactionary clique, disguised as opponents of the old colonial policies, are in fact pursuing a policy of aggression against China and are trying to isolate the People's Republic of China. The American majority in the United Nations, acting on the direct orders of the American reactionary clique, is obstructing the legitimate representatives of the Chinese people from obtaining their place in the United Nations. At the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the American delegation did everything possible to oppose the Soviet delegation's proposal that representatives of the People's Republic of China should be invited to take their legitimate seats in the various bodies of the United Nations. The American imperialists are shamelessly interfering in the internal affairs of Eastern countries, blockading Asian countries, and instigating wars among the peoples of Asia. They are supporting puppets like Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee and attempting to obstruct the historical progress of the people.
    However, no reactionary force in the world can stop the progressive development of human society. The prosperity of People's China, the rapid development of the countries in the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the growth of national liberation movements and revolutionary democratic movements are convincing proof. The future of mankind belongs to democracy and socialism! On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries and all progressive humanity extend their heartfelt congratulations to the great Chinese people and the glorious Chinese Communist Party, and wish them new achievements in implementing their national industrialization plan, in developing agriculture and improving the people's welfare, and in further consolidating their people's democratic state in an all-round way.

    中华人民共和国走上发展和繁荣的道路
    ——“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”社论
    十月一日是中华人民共和国成立四周年纪念日。伟大的中国人民在政治和劳动热情空前高涨的气氛中庆祝这个值得纪念的日子。苏联人民、欧洲和亚洲各人民民主国家的劳动人民、全体进步人类，都和中国人民一道，共同庆祝人民中国的胜利。
    过去的四年，已经向全世界展示了中华人民共和国的伟大的生命力和力量。它的各种伟大成就之一，就是人民民主专政的社会和国家制度以及它的牢不可破的基础——以工人阶级为领导的工农联盟已经在中国巩固了。这个多民族国家的各民族的兄弟般的友谊正在日益发展。在人民民主统一战线的旗帜下，各民主爱国党派和团体已经更加紧密地团结在中国人民胜利的鼓舞者和组织者——中国共产党的周围。国内已经创造了胜利执行发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的先决条件。物质福利正在不断地改善，人民的文化水平也在提高。
    中华人民共和国的国际威望大大地提高了。伟大的中国永远不再是侵略势力的侵略目标和帝国主义剥削的对象了。它有史以来第一次地获得了真正的主权。中华人民共和国是一个新的大国，它和一切爱好和平的力量共同维护和巩固和平及国际安全的利益。今天，要解决东方、亚洲和全世界的国际问题而没有伟大的中国参加是不可能的。中华人民共和国已经成为一支构成亚洲和太平洋区域内一个强有力的稳定因素的国际力量，它使帝国主义者不能任意奴役亚洲人民，不能横行无忌地奉行旨在把亚洲变成另一次世界大战的中心的政策。
    东方各国人民的伟大的复兴的潮流成为我们这
  一时代最主要的特征之一，并为整个现代文明的进一步发展开辟了令人鼓舞的远景。这种伟大潮流，以及新中国四年来发展的结果，向全世界提供了一个令人鼓舞的范例，它证明：为伟大的十月社会主义革命吸引到为自由和独立、为民主和社会主义而斗争的道路上来的解放了的非欧洲的民族，是能和欧洲各国人民一样发展文明和文化的；这是和帝国主义的辩护者的种族主义的理论完全相反的。
    在紧要的关头前去援助朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的英勇的中国人民志愿军，以他们的不朽的业绩和鲜血巩固了中国和朝鲜两国人民的兄弟般的联盟和友谊，并且生动地证明了亚洲各国人民的牢不可破的联系。这证明东方正在展开一个新的纪元，一个亚洲各国人民坚决要赢得并且维护他们民族自由和独立的纪元。朝鲜局势的发展证明了中国人民已经成为东方被压迫民族在他们为争取自由和独立而斗争时的强有力的堡垒。
    中国人民充满建设幸福新生活的热情，在进行他们崇高事业的道路上向前迈进，他们有着以苏联为首的和平民主阵营全体人民的全面的、无私的帮助和支援。一年比一年巩固的苏中友谊是建立在苏中两国人民共同利益的基础上，建立在互相尊重国家主权和独立的基础上，建立在彼此愿意为巩固和平与加强国际安全的事业而服务的坚固基础上的。爱好和平的苏联和爱好和平的中华人民共和国的神圣的友谊，是为远东和全世界和平的伟大事业服务的。中国人民正在热烈地研究并大规模地应用苏联的先进经验和最新的技术成就。苏联的全面的、长期的和大公无私的援助对于中国经济的恢复具有重大的意义。今天，这种援助在建设中国强大的重工业中、在使中国工业化中和使中国逐渐过渡到社会主义中起着十分重要的作用。
    中国人民在始终不渝地以马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的百战百胜的学说作其行动南针的中国共产党的领导下，在短短的一段时间内恢复了为长期战争和帝国主义掠夺者及其国民党反动代理人的统治所破坏了的国民经济，并在工业和农业生产上超过了战前的最高水平。新的工厂、矿坑和油井已经开始生产。由于伟大的土地改革，农民已得到土地并永远摆脱了世代相传的地主的压迫。封建地主的消灭，为提高农业生产力开辟了广阔的前途。农民正自愿地走上互助合作的道路。去年粮食作物的总产量超过了战前最高水平百分之十六点九，而极为重要的技术作物棉花超过了战前最高水平百分之五十。牛羊的头数也大大增加了。劳动人民的福利也改善了。由于社会经济改造和所取得的经济成就，国营工业企业的工人在今年年初的实际工资平均比一九四九年增加了百分之七十五。农民收入已大大增多了。赋税正在有系统地降低。一九五一年，农民所纳的税为他收入的百分之十七，去年只占他收入的百分之十二。可是，在国民党统治下，农民所交纳的税和佃租为他收入的四分之三，有时甚至达到百分之九十。
    中国共产党和以毛泽东同志为首的中国中央人民政府正在尽力设法提高劳动人民的生活水平。千百万的失业者现在找到了工作。在中国历史上第一次建立了社会保险、固定的休息日和工资照付的年假。数十万工人的家庭已搬到舒适的住宅中去。巨额的款项拨来作灌溉和土壤改良工作。城市和乡村的医药服务大大地改善了。一个真正的文化革命正在进行中。
    今年，中国人民正在完成复杂的、繁重的第一个五年计划的第一年的任务。这个五年计划的目的是为国家工业化建立稳固的基础，保证国民经济中的社会主义成份不断地增长。国民经济正在广泛的动力基础——现在正在建筑中的火力发电站和水力发电站——上发展起来。今年，工业中的基本建设数量将比去年多百分之四十。在集中力量发展重工业的同时，中国人民正在继续发展农业、轻工业、食品工业和国民经济的所有部门，使其适合于国民经济有计划发展、按比例发展的客观法则的要求。
    以美国统治集团为首的国际反动派对人民中国的成就和它的爱好和平的外交政策的日益增长的影响是极其愤怒的。帝国主义者不甘心失去他们奴役和掠夺中国人民的权利。美国反动集团伪装为反对旧的殖民政策的人，而事实上，他们对中国执行的是侵略政策，并尽力想使中华人民共和国陷于孤立的地位。联合国内的美国多数正是奉美国反动集团的直接命令，阻挠中国人民的合法代表在联合国取得他们的地位。在第八届联合国大会会议上，美国代表团千方百计地反对苏联代表团提出的应该邀请中华人民共和国代表来占有他们在联合国各机构中的合法地位的要求。美帝国主义者正在厚颜无耻地干涉东方国家的内政，封锁亚洲国家并在亚洲各国人民中挑拨战争。他们正在支持像蒋介石和李承晚这样的傀儡并企图阻挠人民的历史进步的事业。
    但是，任何世界反动势力都不能阻挠人类社会的进步的发展。人民中国的繁荣、以苏联为首的民主阵营中各国的飞跃发展和民族解放运动和革命民主运动的增长，就是令人信服的证明。人类的未来是属于民主和社会主义的！在庆祝中华人民共和国成立四周年的时候，各国的共产党和工人党和全体进步人类都向伟大的中国人民和光荣的中国共产党致以衷心的祝贺，并希望他们在实行他们国家工业化的计划中。在发展农业和增进人民福利的工作中和在更进一步全面地巩固他们人民民主国家中取得新的成就。　（新华社）
