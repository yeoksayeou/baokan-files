The 1953 National Athletics, Gymnastics, and Cycling Games successfully concluded on the afternoon of the 7th, after six days of intense competition. The outstanding athletes from various regions and ethnic groups will take the new sporting spirit and sportsmanship demonstrated at this大会 back to their respective regions, further promoting the development of mass sports activities.

This sports meet was a review of the development of national sports over the past four years; it was also a大会 for outstanding athletes to respond to the care of the motherland with their excellent results and to demonstrate their sporting level. According to大会 statistics, a total of nineteen new national records were set at this sports meet.

This sports meet strongly demonstrated the spirit of the athletes from various regions and units, who were active, eager to learn, united and friendly, not arrogant or discouraged, and displayed a new sporting ethic. Athletes from different regions often practiced various movements together arduously and exchanged experiences. Even at the moment before the start of the competition, those with excellent results often sincerely told their competitors how to start calmly and quickly, how to maintain appropriate reserve strength to prepare for the final break through the finish line, how to pass the baton, and technical advice such as not rushing ahead when turning a bicycle. Thanks to this friendly assistance, the technical level of many athletes has improved rapidly.

Today, the young athletes are excited and thrilled. They reluctantly bid farewell to their comrades who have become familiar. In the lounge below the grandstand of the Xian Nong Tan stadium, athletes were constantly coming and going. Some were exchanging souvenirs, some were writing inscriptions for remembrance, and some were holding hands and asking photographers to take pictures of them. Everyone expressed that they would learn from the heroic athletes of the People's Liberation Army.

Before the closing ceremony, the finals of several events were held, including the men's 10,000 meters and the women's 400 meters. Female athletes performed on the balance beam and uneven bars, and male athletes performed on the rings and pommel horse. Next, students from the Aviation Model Working Group of the Central National Defense Sports Club, the Aviation Academy, and Beijing No. 25 Middle School held a variety of performances, including tethered model airplanes and jet model airplanes. When the model airplanes soared into the air, the whole audience cheered.

At exactly 4:00 PM, to the majestic sound of military music, all the athletes marched into the arena. Tens of thousands of spectators in the stands warmly applauded to congratulate the outstanding athletes from all over the country. Then, Tian Hui, the deputy commander-in-chief of the大会, reported the results of the several days of competition: The first place in the overall team score was the People's Liberation Army delegation, the second place was the Northeast Region delegation, the third place was the East China Region delegation, and the fourth place was the North China Region delegation. The individuals with the highest overall scores were: Liu Chengbang, a clerk from the Railway Bureau, Liu Yuying (female), a student from the Dalian Normal School, Li Bingcheng, a physical education teacher from Shandong Medical College, and Shi Qin, a squad leader from a unit of the People's Liberation Army. When Ma John, the chief judge of the大会, presented the silver cups one by one to the winners, applause was incessant, and cheers resounded throughout the venue. The Presidium of the大会 also presented a silver cup to the Burmese Chinese Overseas Chinese Sports Touring Group participating in the大会 as a souvenir, and distributed a souvenir to each of the six athletes from the delegation who participated in the sports meet.

Amid thunderous applause, the大会 passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao.

Finally, Rong Gaotang, Secretary-General of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, delivered the closing address.

At 5:30 PM, the flag-lowering ceremony was held, marking the successful conclusion of the sports meet. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    全国田径、体操、自行车运动大会胜利闭幕
    一九五三年全国田径、体操、自行车运动大会，经过六天的紧张竞赛，已于七日下午圆满闭幕。来自各地、各民族的优秀运动员们，将把这次大会所表现出来的新的体育精神和体育道德作风带回各个地区去，进一步推动群众性的体育运动的开展。
    这次运动大会，是检阅四年来全国体育运动开展情况的大会；也是优秀的运动员们以自己优异的成绩回答祖国对他们的关怀和显示自己体育水平的大会。据大会统计：这次运动大会共创造了十九项新的全国最高纪录。
    这次运动大会，强烈地表现出各地区、各单位代表队的运动员们，积极进取、虚心学习、团结友爱、不骄不馁的精神和新的体育道德作风。不同地区的运动员们，经常在一起艰苦地练习各种动作和交流经验。就是在开始比赛前一刻，成绩优异者也常常诚恳地告诉他的竞争者怎样沉着而又迅速地起第一步，怎样保持适当的余力准备最后冲破红线，怎样接棒以及自行车在转弯时不要抢先等技术。由于这种友谊的帮助，许多运动员的技术水平都迅速提高了。
    今天，年青的运动员们的心情是兴奋而激动的。他们依依不舍地和已经熟悉了的同志们告别。先农坛运动场看台下面的休息室，运动员们来往穿梭不停，有的在互相交换纪念物，有的在互相题字留念和手拉手地请摄影记者给他们拍照。大家纷纷表示：要向英雄的解放军运动员们学习。
    大会闭幕前，还进行了男子一万公尺、女子四百公尺等多项决赛。女运动员表演了平衡木、高低杠，男运动员表演了吊环、鞍马。接着，由中央国防体育俱乐部航空模型工作组、航空学院及北京市第二十五中学等学校学生，为大会举行了牵引模型飞机和喷气式模型飞机等多种多样的表演。当一只只模型飞机腾空而起时，全场欢呼。
    四时正，在雄壮的军乐声中，全体运动员列队入场，看台上的数万观众，热烈地鼓掌向来自各地的优秀的运动员们致贺。接着，大会副总指挥田辉报告了几天竞赛的结果：团体总分数第一名是人民解放军代表队，第二名是东北区代表队，第三名是华东区代表队，第四名是华北区代表队。个人总分数最多的有：铁路司镑员刘成邦、旅大师范学校学生刘玉英（女）、山东医学院体育教师李秉诚、人民解放军某部班长石勤等。当大会总裁判马约翰将银杯一个个分赠给优胜者时，掌声不绝，欢呼声响彻全场。大会主席团并发给参加大会竞赛的缅甸华侨归国体育观光团银杯一个，作为纪念，并分赠代表团中参加运动大会竞赛的六位运动员每人一份纪念物。
    在暴风雨般的掌声中，大会通过了向毛主席致敬电。
    最后，由中央人民政府体育运动委员会秘书长荣高棠致闭幕词。
    五时半，举行了降旗仪式，至此，运动大会圆满结束。　（据新华社讯）
