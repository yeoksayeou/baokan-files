The 38th issue of the Chinese edition of the Cominform's newspaper "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" for 1953 has been published.

This issue contains the communique on the plenary session held by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in September, and publishes in full the resolution on measures for the further development of agriculture in the Soviet Union adopted by the plenary session based on the report by Comrade N.S. Khrushchev. This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Great Program for the Further Development of Soviet Agriculture." The editorial points out that an important component of the great program of communist construction in the Soviet Union is to practically solve the task of producing abundant agricultural products on the basis of the great development of socialist industry—the leading force of the national economy. The resolution of the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee is a great program for the further development of agriculture in the Soviet state and the rapid increase in agricultural production. This resolution and Comrade Khrushchev's report profoundly elucidate the basic issues of further developing the various agricultural sectors of the Soviet Union and prescribe specific methods for completing these tasks. This resolution will be a great help to the people's democratic countries facing the task of comprehensively developing agriculture. The explanation of the significance of the resolution of the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee to the working people by the communist and workers' parties of various countries will be a new contribution to the cause of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and to the struggle for lasting peace, democracy and socialism.

Under the title "Steadily Developing the National Economy and Improving the Welfare of the Czechoslovak People," this issue contains excerpts from the report made by the Prime Minister of the Czechoslovak Republic and member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Viliam Široký, on behalf of the government at the session of the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic on September 15. The report summarizes the great achievements Czechoslovakia has made in implementing the first Five-Year Plan (1949 to 1953), and points out the Czechoslovak government's policy for further developing the national economy: the government believes that measures must be taken to ensure the coordinated development of all sectors of the national economy, and most importantly, to ensure that the raw material base of heavy industry can be developed on a large scale. The government will pay close attention to maintaining correct proportions between the production of means of production and the production of consumer goods, between the development of industry and agriculture, and between the various production sectors. The report also mentions the important measures that the Czechoslovak government is prepared to take in further developing agriculture and improving the living standards of the working people.

    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第三十八期中文版已经出版。
    本期刊载了关于苏联共产党中央委员会在九月间举行全体会议的公报，并全文发表了全体会议就尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的报告通过的关于进一步发展苏联农业的措施的决议。本期以“进一步发展苏联农业的伟大纲领”为题发表社论。社论指出，苏联的共产主义建设的伟大纲领中的一个重要组成部分，就是在社会主义工业——国民经济的主导力量——大大发展的基础上，实际地解决生产丰足的农产品的任务。苏共中央全体会议的决议，是进一步发展苏维埃国家的农业、迅速增加农产品产量的伟大纲领。这个决议和赫鲁晓夫同志的报告，深刻地阐明了进一步发展苏联各农业部门的基本问题，并规定了完成这些任务的具体办法。这个决议对于面临着全面发展农业的任务的人民民主国家将是一个巨大的帮助。各国共产党和工人党向劳动人民解释苏共中央全体会议的决议的意义，对于巩固工农联盟的事业，对于争取持久和平、民主和社会主义的斗争，将是一个新的贡献。
    本期在“稳步发展国民经济，提高捷克斯洛伐克人民的福利”的标题下，摘要刊载了捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府总理、捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会主席团委员威廉·西罗基九月十五日在捷克斯洛伐克共和国国民议会会议上代表政府所作的报告。报告中综述了捷克斯洛伐克在实行第一个五年计划
  （一九四九到一九五三年）中已经取得的伟大成就，并指出捷克斯洛伐克政府进一步发展国民经济的方针说：政府认为必须采取措施以保证国民经济各部门的协调发展，最重要的是首先保证重工业的原料基地能够大规模地发展。政府将密切注意，使生产资料生产和消费资料生产之间、工业和农业的发展之间以及各生产部门之间都保持着正确的比例。报告还谈到捷克斯洛伐克政府准备在进一步发展农业和提高劳动人民生活水平方面所采取的重要措施。　（新华社）
