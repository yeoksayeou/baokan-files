Every year, I treat National Day as a great day to celebrate and congratulate the country. I joyfully and sincerely celebrate the new and brilliant achievements that the country has achieved this year!

At this time last year, I came to Beijing with the Northeast China National Day Observation Group and met our great leader Chairman Mao. I still remember clearly the scene when Chairman Mao received us and his teachings to us. The last sentence of Chairman Mao's speech at the banquet was: We will do more work in the coming year. At that time, I thought: This more work includes strengthening national defense, continuing to strengthen the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea; it includes developing industrial and agricultural production; and it undoubtedly also includes doing a good job in state-owned commercial work, doing a good job in urban-rural exchange... After I came back, I followed Chairman Mao's instructions at all times and worked hard to do more work.

More than 90% of the population of our county is scattered in rural areas. If we do not give full play to the role of cooperatives in facilitating urban-rural trade, do not rely on cooperatives to supply the needs of farmers, expand commodity sales, and expand wholesale business, we will not be able to serve farmers and agricultural production well. Moreover, we cannot help cooperatives do a good job in supply and marketing work, so that farmers can be educated through supply and marketing cooperatives and gradually organized to take the road of cooperativization. But how can we specifically rely on cooperatives to expand commodity sales? This has been a problem that has not been solved for a long time.

One day, Qiu Zhiren, a salesperson in my department, went to the Henan Cooperative and found that the Henan Cooperative lacked more than a dozen kinds of commodities that were overstocked in my department. At that time, Qiu Zhiren introduced all the commodities in my department, and the Henan Cooperative immediately bought more than 6 million yuan worth of goods from us. The relationship between the Henan Cooperative and my department is one of the best among the 53 cooperatives in the county, but they still don’t understand each other so well. This problem aroused my great attention, and I immediately mobilized everyone to discuss and study how to improve the relationship with the cooperatives. So it was decided to select salesperson Wu Chunting as a liaison officer, who would be specifically responsible for contacting rural cooperatives and understanding the needs of farmers. Once, the liaison officer took commodity samples to various cooperatives to promote sales, and sold tens of millions of yuan worth of goods in one trip. After that, I came up with the idea of hiring a salesperson in each cooperative as a correspondent, who would often write letters to my department to reflect the sales situation of the cooperative, so that the contact surface between my department and the cooperatives could be expanded and maintained. Through this kind of contact, I discovered that the key to relying on cooperatives to expand commodity sales is to be frank with cooperatives and exchange information with each other. Therefore, it was stipulated that in addition to notifying the cooperatives of new goods at any time, a copy of the existing commodity catalog should be printed and distributed to the cooperatives every half month, so that the cooperatives would have a basis for purchasing goods. Later, a purchase registration card for cooperatives was established, according to which the purchase situation of cooperatives could be better grasped and the supply work could be done more accurately. In this way, the sales of state-owned products in rural areas were opened up, commodity sales were expanded, the backlog of inventory materials was reduced, commodity circulation was accelerated, the turnover was increased, and the needs of the people were better met. In the second quarter, our sales plan exceeded 27.9%, in addition to making up for the part of the plan that was not completed in the first quarter, it also exceeded 4.5% of the half-year plan. The August plan has also been exceeded, and we are now striving to exceed 5% of the third quarter plan in celebration of National Day.

    进一步巩固与合作社的联系制度
    沟通城乡贸易为工农业生产服务

    每年的国庆节，我都把它当作向国家庆功贺喜的大好日子来迎接。我怀着欢乐的心情衷心地庆贺国家在今年所获得新的辉煌成就！
    去年这个时候，我随东北区国庆观礼团到北京来，见到了我们的伟大领袖毛主席。我对毛主席接见我们当时的情景和毛主席对我们的教导，直到今天还都记得清清楚楚，毛主席在欢宴会上讲话最后的一句是说：今后的一年我们将作更多的工作。当时我想：这更多的工作，包括加强国防建设，继续加强抗美援朝斗争；包括发展工农业生产；无疑也包括着搞好国营商业工作，搞好城乡交流，……。我回来以后，时时刻刻遵照毛主席的指示，努力做更多的工作。
    我们全县百分之九十以上的人口分散在农村，如不充分发挥合作社沟通城乡贸易的作用，不依靠合作社来供应农民需要，扩大商品推销，扩大批发业务，就不能很好地为农民和农业生产服务，更不能做到帮助合作社做好供销工作，使农民通过供销合作社受到教育，逐渐组织起来走合作化的道路。但是究竟怎样才能具体地依靠合作社扩大商品推销？却是很久以来没有解决的问题。
    有一天我部营业员邱志仁到河南合作社去，发现我部积压的十余种商品，河南合作社里都缺少，当时邱志仁介绍了我部所有的商品，河南合作社马上就向我们买了六百多万元的货。河南合作社与我部的关系是全县五十三个合作社中最好的一个，可是相互还这样不了解，这个问题引起了我很大的注意，并立即发动大家讨论研究如何改进与合作社的关系。于是就决定抽出营业员吴春庭作联络员，专门负责和农村合作社联络，并了解农民需要。有一次联络员带着商品样子到各合作社去宣传推销，一次就卖了几千万元的货。此后，我又想出在各个合作社聘请一位营业员当通讯员，经常用写信的办法向我部反映合作社销售情况，使我部与合作社联系面扩大和经常保持下来。通过这种联系，使我发现了依靠合作社扩大商品推销的关键，是要向合作社交底，相互通气。因此就规定除来新货随时通知合作社外，每半个月把现有商品目录印发一份给合作社，使合作社有了进货依据。后来又建立了合作社购货登记卡片，根据它可以更好地掌握合作社进货情况，把供应工作做得更准确。这样就打开了国营产品在农村的销路，扩大了商品推销，减少了库存物资积压，加速了商品流转，增加了营业额，也更好地满足了人民需要。第二季度我们的销售计划超过了百分之二十七点九，除弥补上第一季度计划没完成部分外，还超过了半年计划的百分之四点五。八月份计划也超过了，现正为庆祝国庆节争取超额完成第三季度计划百分之五而努力。
