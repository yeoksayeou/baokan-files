    Demobilized Soldier Yang Laowu Actively Serves the People and is Elected Deputy Township Head
    Yao Jinglong of the Kaihua County People's Government, Zhejiang Province, writes: On September 12th, our county's Minglian Township held its first Township People's Congress, and demobilized soldier Yang Laowu was elected as Deputy Township Head by all the representatives.

    Yang Laowu is an excellent Communist Party member. He was a good soldier in the army and was successively named a work model, a study model, and a model of unity and fraternity. In June of this year, he was demobilized due to illness. When he returned to his hometown, the army leaders taught him: "You must be a good example on the production front as well." He did not let down the Party's education and the leaders' expectations. In the short three months since returning home, he has done many good things for the people.

    When he returned to Yangjia Village, the local people were busy repairing the Yaojia Dam. Although he was not in good health and lacked strength, he actively participated in the work of opening drainage ditches and carrying stones, and played a leading role in the work. After the ditch was repaired, there were several days of heavy rain, and a part of the dam collapsed, blocking the ditch. After the rain, there were many sunny days, and the rice fields suffered from drought. At the same time, hundreds of acres of June beans in the village urgently needed to be harvested. At that time, many people felt helpless. Yang Laowu took the initiative to discuss with the village cadres, actively educated the masses to establish the confidence of "man will conquer nature," and mobilized the masses to rush to harvest on the one hand, and took time to draw water and repair the dam on the other hand. In this way, the collapsed project was repaired ahead of schedule, and the harvesting work was completed on time. Although Yangjia Village encountered the serious difficulty of nearly seventy days without rain this year, due to timely rescue, most of the rice fields were still able to maintain or exceed last year's output. In addition to thanking the leadership of the People's Government, the masses all said: Laowu has contributed a lot since he came home.

    Not long after Yang Laowu arrived home, he joined the Yang Zhilong mutual aid team. He found that there were wage arrears in the team, and some members were therefore not very enthusiastic about production. He promptly promoted the settlement of wages for the team members and set a method for calculating work points in the future. This improved the team members' enthusiasm for production and consolidated the mutual aid team. He can often care about the sufferings of the people, and once helped Yang Fuqing's family through the summer famine and helped the military dependent Yang Chigu carry stones to make walls.

    These actions of Yang Laowu have won the warm support and respect of the masses. At the Township People's Congress, all the representatives elected him as Deputy Township Head.

### 复员军人杨老五积极为群众服务当选副乡长

    复员军人杨老五积极为群众服务当选副乡长
    浙江省开化县人民政府姚敬隆来信：九月十二日我县明廉乡召开第一次乡人民代表大会，复员军人杨老五被全体代表选举为副乡长。
    杨老五是一个优秀的共产党员。他在部队里是一个好战士，曾先后被评选为工作模范、学习模范和团结友爱模范。今年六月，他因病复员。回乡时，部队首长教导他：“到生产战线上要同样地做一个好榜样。”他没有辜负党的教育和首长的期望，在回乡后短短的三个多月中，就替人民办了很多好事情。
    他回到杨家村时，当地人民正在紧张地抢修姚家大坝。他虽然身体不好，气力不够，却积极地参加了开水沟、抬石块的工作，并在工作中起了领导作用。水沟修好后，连下大雨，水坝倒塌了一部分，沟道闭塞，雨后又晴了好多天，稻田发生旱象；同时村里数百亩地的六月豆也急需抢收。当时不少群众都感到没办法。杨老五就主动和村干部研究，积极教育群众树立“人定胜天”的信心，发动群众一方面突击抢收，一方面抽出时间车水、修坝。这样，既提前修好了倒塌的工程，又按时完成了抢收工作。杨家村今年虽然遇到了将近七十天没有下雨的严重困难，但由于抢救及时，大部分稻田仍能保持或超过去年产量。群众除了感谢人民政府的领导以外，都说：老五回家来出力可不少呀。
    杨老五到家不久，就加入了杨志龙互助组。他发现组里有工资拖欠现象，某些组员因而生产情绪不高，就及时推动组员们结算了工资，并订好以后计工算帐的办法。这就提高了组员的生产积极性，并使互助组趋于巩固。他能经常关心人民群众的疾苦，曾帮助杨富清家里渡过了夏荒，帮助军属杨痴古挑石块做墙。
    杨老五这些行动得到了群众的热烈拥护和尊敬。在乡人民代表大会上，全体代表选他为副乡长。
