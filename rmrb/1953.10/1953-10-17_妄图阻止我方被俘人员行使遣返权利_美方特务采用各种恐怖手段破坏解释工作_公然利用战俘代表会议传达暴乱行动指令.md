Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th -- The deception, fraud, and violent intimidation by US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents have caused our captured personnel to misunderstand their rights and the position of the neutral nations during the explanation process. They are also greatly affected by the terrifying memories of the illegal "screening" conducted by the US last year. This is the profound impression gained by reporters who interviewed ten志愿军 (Volunteer Army) captured personnel repatriated yesterday.

The ten captured personnel who returned yesterday were originally held in Camp 31. They said that on the eve of the explanation work starting on the 14th, they knew nothing. They only saw US-Chiang Kai-shek special agent leaders such as Ying Xiangyun and Liu Wenjie holding meetings all night. Then, the original twenty-odd special agent armed "security guards" were doubled, armed with sharp knives and wooden sticks, and patrolled the camp. The prisoners of war felt an unusual atmosphere of tension and terror. The special agents also used loudspeakers to contact special agents from other camps.

On the morning of the 15th, Chairman Thimayya of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission convened a meeting of Chinese prisoner of war representatives. Ying Xiangyun and Liu Wenjie, the heads of the special agents in Camp 31, impersonated prisoner of war representatives and went to participate. After they left, the remaining special agents locked the prisoners of war firmly in their tents, conducted intimidating "spiritual lectures," forced the prisoners of war to once again express their determination to "go to Taiwan," and on the spot dragged out a prisoner of war and stabbed the Kuomintang flag on his chest.

At noon on the 15th, after the US-Chiang Kai-shek special agent leaders Ying Xiangyun and Liu Wenjie returned from seeing the explanation site, they immediately convened a meeting of prisoners of war, forcing everyone to do the following: (1) When going to listen to the explanation, one person must monitor another. If the person in front "betrays," the person behind will be executed. The special agents also conducted strict grouping of the prisoners of war. (2) When entering the explanation camp, the ears must be plugged, and "Go to Taiwan" must be shouted repeatedly. The shouts must be heard by people in the adjacent explanation tent, otherwise they will also be executed. (3) The special agents bring bugles to the explanation site. If someone applies for repatriation, they will blow the charge horn, and everyone must shout "Indians are forcibly repatriating," rush over to kill the Indian, Czechoslovak, and Polish personnel and our explanation representatives, and take the opportunity to rush into the tent prepared for repatriation and kill the prisoners of war who have applied for repatriation. Jia Hongkun, one of the returned personnel, said: The special agent Liu Wenjie also drew a map of the explanation site for the prisoners of war on the spot, and threatened them, saying: The Indians have guaranteed that after the explanation, they will all return to the original camp to live, and those who apply for repatriation must pass through the road near the original camp to go out. We must grab them back and beat them to death!

The returned personnel all said: In this way, we were all confused, not knowing whether this "review" (referring to the explanation) could really get us out, or whether it would be like the bloody April 8th "review" last year (referring to the bloody "screening" conducted by the US in April last year)! They all saw that during the explanation, the special agent Liu Wenjie, in the name of a "prisoner of war representative," was also driving around in a jeep, fiercely warning the prisoners of war: "There are American representatives and Taiwan representatives in the tent to support us. Whoever dares to 'betray' will be executed on the spot!" He also directed the prisoners of war who had not yet listened to the explanation to squeeze close to the explanation tent, monitoring the person listening to the explanation in front of them one by one, and shouting reactionary slogans to urge him to come out quickly. Mu Xianzhang, one of the returned personnel, said: I had made up my mind to come back a long time ago, but I was very scared, not knowing whether the Indians would send me back. When I walked into the explanation tent, I kept chanting "Return to Taiwan, return to Taiwan..." like a scripture. After I heard clearly what our explanation representative and the neutral country personnel said, I bravely said "I want to return to my country" regardless of the Taiwan Kuomintang special agent monitoring me, and as a result, I really came back!

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 14th -- US special agents in the neutral nations' detention camps are taking advantage of the opportunity to hold prisoner of war representative meetings to secretly transmit instructions for sabotaging the explanation work and organizing riot actions. This new and serious situation was revealed on the 13th by two Korean People's Army captured personnel who were sent to our side by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

Kim Kwang-ho, one of the returning Korean People's Army personnel, escaped from Camp G55 under the supervision of Indian troops. He once served as the "propaganda section chief" in a special agent team in this camp. He said: In the beginning, the special agents often used the opportunity of Indian supervisory troops calling them to meetings to secretly transmit instructions and news. He said that on October 4th, Liu Laiyun, the special agent captain of Camp G55, was called to a meeting by the Indian officers. After Liu Laiyun returned, he said triumphantly: "Today I received an important instruction from my superiors (referring to the special agent leaders): When the explanation work starts in the future, we will hold demonstrations and marches. At that time, the food supply may not be able to keep up, so we must now store food, saving half of our lunch to prepare for future difficulties." Kim Kwang-ho said: Since October 9th, when the so-called "camp commanders" and "enclosure commanders," that is, the special agent leaders, of the prisoner of war camps were allowed to hold regular meetings in the presence of translators from the Indian supervisory troops, the special agents have been taking advantage of this opportunity to carry out activities on a large scale. The special agent Liu Laiyun said triumphantly: "In the future, communication will be easier! The captains can meet frequently, and if there are problems, in addition to written communication, they can also talk face to face." On October 9th, Liu Laiyun also sent five special agent personnel disguised as "patients" to the hospital to inquire about news. After these "patients" arrived at the hospital, they used signal flags to contact the camp. Liu Laiyun said disapprovingly: "Now we can communicate freely, why use signal flags?" Liu Laiyun also instructed the special agents present: "In the future, we generally don't need to use signal flags!"

Kim Kwang-ho said: He personally saw Wen Chonghao, the special agent leader and former head of the "Anti-Communist Youth Corps" of the Nonsan prisoner of war camp, wearing the armband of "enclosure commander," traveling between the camps. He had seen Wen Chonghao twice in Camp G55 and in the "hospital," and he knew that Wen Chonghao was originally in Camp 49. He said: "Wen Chonghao is obviously using the name of 'attending meetings' to arrange terrorist activities for the special agents. After Wen Chonghao came, the special agents in Camp G55 worked all night to make more than twenty sharp knives, saying that whoever wants to be repatriated will be killed!"

Kim Kwang-ho stole away when the special agent captain asked him to "stand guard" at the hospital.

Liu Yinglie, a member of the Korean People's Army who was repatriated with Kim Kwang-ho, had been described as a "mental patient" in the US hospital, but he returned in good spirits, talking and laughing. His words once again confirmed the various terrorist activities in the US "hospital" in the Indian troop-supervised camp. He said: "On October 10th, Li Dekui, who lived with me in the mental ward, had recovered from his illness. He excitedly found a Syngman Rhee gang doctor in the hospital and said: It looks like I can go out. But this doctor said sinisterly to others: Li Dekui's illness has relapsed and he needs to be given anesthesia and electrotherapy quickly. Subsequently, I heard this doctor say to Li Jibao, another Rhee bandit special agent disguised as a nurse: Li Dekui may 'change,' let's get rid of him. Sure enough, that afternoon, I saw two nurses giving Li Dekui an injection, and Li Dekui had become unconscious. I felt that I really couldn't wait any longer, so I pretended to be delivering food to the kitchen, preparing to escape. The special agents sent someone to follow me. As soon as I got to the kitchen, I saw that there was no one nearby, so I said loudly to him: I'm leaving, what are you going to do? He was so angry that he yelled and cursed, and picked up stones to hit me, but he couldn't catch up with me. I finally returned to the embrace of the Republic that I had longed for for so long."

As of the return of Kim Kwang-ho and others, 123 of our captured personnel have broken through the control of the special agents and been repatriated.

    妄图阻止我方被俘人员行使遣返权利
    美方特务采用各种恐怖手段破坏解释工作
    公然利用战俘代表会议传达暴乱行动指令
    【新华社开城十六日电】美蒋特务的蒙蔽、欺骗和暴力恫吓，使我方被俘人员在解释时对自己的权利和中立国的立场有误解。他们同时还受着去年美方进行非法“甄别”时恐怖记忆的巨大影响。这是记者访问昨天遣返的十名志愿军被俘人员所得到的深刻印象。
    昨天归来的十名被俘人员原来都在三十一号营场被看管，他们说：在十四日解释工作开始的前夕，他们还什么也不知道，只见美蒋特务头子应祥云、刘文杰等在连夜开会。然后，就将原有的二十几个特务武装“警备队员”增加了一倍，带上尖刀、木棒，全部出动在营场内巡逻，战俘都感到有一种不寻常的紧张的恐怖气氛。特务们还用喇叭筒和其他营场的特务分子联络。
    十五日清早，中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅召集中国战俘代表开会，三十一号营场的特务头目应祥云和刘文杰就冒充战俘代表前去参加。他们走后，其余的特务分子就把战俘们牢牢地关在帐篷里，进行恫吓性的“精神讲话”，强迫战俘再次表示“到台湾”的决心，并且当场拉出去一个战俘，在他的胸部刺上了国民党旗子。
    十五日中午，美蒋特务头子应祥云、刘文杰看过解释场所回来以后，就立即召集战俘开会，强迫大家要做到以下几点：（一）去听解释时要一个人监视一个人，如果前面的人“叛变”了，后面的人就要被处死。特务们并且把战俘进行了严密的编组。（二）进入解释营场时要把耳朵塞起来，连连喊“到台湾”，喊声必须要使隔壁解释帐篷里的人听到，否则也要处死。（三）特务带军号到解释场所去，有人申请遣返，就吹冲锋号，大家一定要喊“印度人强迫遣返”，冲过去打死印度、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰的人员和我方解释代表，并乘势冲进准备遣返的帐篷，打死已申请遣返的战俘。归来人员贾洪坤说：特务刘文杰还当场画出解释场所的地图给战俘看，并威胁他们说：印度人已经保证经过解释之后都要回原营场来住，申请遣返者也必须经过原营场附近的路出去，我们一定要把他抓回来打死！
    归来人员都说：这样，我们都被弄得糊里糊涂，不知这次“审查”（即指解释）是不是真能出来，还是像去年的四·八“审查”（按指美方在去年四月进行的血腥“甄别”）一样！他们都看到，在解释进行的时候，特务刘文杰还以“战俘代表”名义坐着吉普车到处恶狠狠地警告战俘：“帐篷里有美国代表和台湾代表给我们撑腰，谁敢‘叛变’就地处死！”他又指挥尚未听取解释的战俘挤近解释帐篷，一个一个监视前面正在听解释的人，并喊反动口号催他赶快出来。归来人员穆宪章说：我早就打定主意要回来，但非常害怕，不晓得印度人是不是会把我送回去。我走进解释帐篷时，也是连连念经似地喊着“回台湾，回台湾……”，当我听清了我们解释代表和中立国人员说的话以后，我不顾还有台湾国民党特务在一旁监视，就壮着胆子说“要回国”，结果真的回来了！
    【新华社开城十四日电】中立国看管营场中的美方特务正在利用开战俘代表会议的机会，秘密传达种种破坏解释工作和组织暴乱行动的指令。这个新的严重情况，是在十三日由中立国遣返委员会遣送给我方的二名朝鲜人民军被俘人员所揭露的。
    归来的朝鲜人民军人员金光浩是从印度部队看管下的G五十五号营场逃出来的，他曾经在这个营场里的一个特务队里当过“宣传系长”。他说：在最初，特务们往往利用印度看管部队召集他们开会的机会，秘密传递指令和消息。他说，十月四日，G五十五号营场的大队长特务柳来云被叫到印度军官那里开会。柳来云回来后，就得意地说：“今天我从上级（指特务头子）那里得到了一个重要指示：将来解释工作开始时，我们要举行示威、游行。到那时候，粮食可能供应不上，因此我们现在就要储存粮食，把中午饭省下一半，准备应付将来的困难情况。”金光浩说：自从十月九日战俘营的所谓“营场长官”与“围场长官”，即特务头子们被准许在印度看管部队翻译在场的条件下定期开会以后，特务们更利用这一机会大肆活动。特务柳来云曾得意忘形地说：“今后联络更容易了！大队长可以经常见面，有问题除了书面交流以外，还可当面会谈。”十月九日，柳来云并曾派了五个特务分子假装“病人”到医院里去探听消息，这些“病人”在到医院以后打旗语和营场联络，柳来云即大不以为然地说：“现在可以自由联络嘛，还打旗语干什么？”柳来云并吩咐在场的特务们说：“以后一般不用打旗语了！”
    金光浩说：他曾亲眼看见特务头子、原论山战俘营“反共青年团”总团长文重浩佩戴着“围场长官”的臂章，在各营场来往。他曾经在G五十五号营场和“医院”里两次看见文重浩，而他知道文重浩原是在第四十九号营场的。他说：“文重浩显然是在假‘开会’的名义向特务们布置恐怖活动。在文重浩来过以后，G五十五号营场的特务们已经连夜打好了二十多把尖刀，说谁要遣返就要杀掉他！”
    金光浩是在特务大队长要他去病院“放哨”时偷跑回来的。
    和金光浩一同被遣返的朝鲜人民军人员柳应烈，在美方的医院里一直被说成是“精神病患者”，但他回来后却精神良好，有说有笑。他的话又一次证实了在印度部队看管营地中的美方“医院”里的种种恐怖活动。他说：“十月十日，和我同住在精神病科的李德奎，他的病已经好了，他兴奋地找医院里的一个李承晚匪帮的医生说：看样子我可以出去了。但这个医生却阴险地对别人说：李德奎的病又发作了，需要赶快打麻醉针和施用电气治疗。随后，我却听到这个医生对另一个假装护士的李匪特务李基瀑说：李德奎可能要‘变’，把他搞掉算了。果然，当天下午，我便看到两个护士正在给李德奎打针，李德奎已经变得昏迷不醒。我感到实在不能再等待了，便假装着到厨房送饭，准备逃跑。特务们派了一个人跟着我。一到厨房，我看附近没有人，便大声对他说：我要走了，你怎么办？气得他又叫又骂，还拾起石子准备打我，但总追不上我。我终于回到我想望了好久的共和国怀抱了。”
    到金光浩等回来为止，冲破特务控制得到遣返的我方被俘人员已有一百二十三人。
