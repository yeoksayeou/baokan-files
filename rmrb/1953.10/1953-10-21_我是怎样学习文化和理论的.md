How I Learn Culture and Theory
Lü Junfeng, County Chief of Qinggang County, Heilongjiang Province

I.

I used to be a poor child. From the age of nine, I herded cattle and sheep. For two years, at eleven and twelve, I studied intermittently at a private school, but then dropped out. After that, I either farmed at home or worked as a laborer for landlords, and also worked in coal mines. In those years, life was very hard, often struggling to make ends meet, so there was no opportunity to study! Therefore, when I started working in 1947, I was basically illiterate.

The earliest revolutionary struggle I participated in was the land reform struggle. At that time, I relied solely on enthusiasm, thinking that being brave, willing to endure hardship, and having a firm stance was enough, and I didn't think about the importance of studying culture and theory. The Party's land reform policy at that time was very clear and written in the "Land Law Outline"; however, I couldn't understand the documents. I could only roughly remember the policy conveyed at the district committee meetings. As a result, there were many deviations in my work. For example, I didn't understand the policy of uniting with middle peasants very well, thinking that middle peasants had property, so it didn't matter if we went a bit overboard. As a result, in Tongxin Village, Eighth District, which I was in charge of, twelve middle-peasant households were wrongly struggled against, seriously undermining the Party's policy. In 1948, the Party proposed: organizing and leading peasants to restore and develop agricultural production, advocating and educating peasants to take the new road of organization. At that time, I didn't understand the Party's policy, and the future and direction of rural work were even more unclear, so I blindly organized "large bundles of green," "communal feeding of horses," "people eating together, horses feeding from the same trough." As a result, several groups I personally established collapsed before summer weeding. Afterwards, people told me that the newspapers criticized this practice, saying it was "agricultural socialist egalitarianism," but I was still "only hearing the creaking of the pulley, not knowing where the well was."

These two serious mistakes made me extremely sad. The instructions of the higher-level Party, the working experience of various places, and many things published in the newspapers, I couldn't understand. This made it difficult to avoid making mistakes in my work. Later, I felt more deeply that without culture and theory, work would become more and more difficult. At that time, many cadres from peasant backgrounds had this saying: "Illiterates can't make it." I also wavered. However, after the Party's education, especially after the criticism of pessimistic sentiments at the district committee meeting, I quickly realized that my past thinking was wrong. From then on, I was determined to first learn culture well, and then further study theory.

My cultural studies began in March 1948. When I started learning, there were many difficulties: the work was busy, I often had to go to the countryside, and there was no fixed teacher or study time. I would learn a few words today and forget them tomorrow, and I couldn't remember them. I consulted comrades with higher levels for learning methods, and the answer I got was the two words "perseverance" and "diligence." This was very enlightening to me. The comrades around me gave me a lot of enthusiastic encouragement, gradually dispelling my thoughts of "fear of trouble, no time, and poor memory for adults." I made a preliminary plan, determined to persevere in studying for two hours every day, recognize five new words, and use the "Heilongjiang Daily" and "New Farmer's Daily" as teaching materials. I also set a policy for my cultural studies: "Study diligently, ask diligently, and write diligently." In the past few years, I have resolutely followed this policy. The first step was to be able to recognize and speak. I asked a clerk from the district committee to be my teacher and teach me a few words every day; when I went to the countryside, I would ask primary school teachers; after I had a little foundation, I relied on dictionaries. During this stage, the first difficulty I encountered was: meetings day and night, my mind was muddled, but I still insisted on studying for two hours every day. In order to save time, sometimes I didn't ride a horse when I went to the countryside, but read while walking; read at night in winter, and read early in the morning in summer. But I still couldn't remember some words. Sometimes I asked about a word many times and still couldn't remember it. So I used a vocabulary book, noting down homophones next to the new words to help me remember, and I set aside two days a month to review the new words. This worked very well. Immediately afterwards, I picked up short stories such as "Xia Hongqiu" and "Livelihood" to read. When I encountered new words, I would put them aside first and look them up in the dictionary later. This helped me consolidate and recognize many more new words.

In the summer of 1948, I had recognized some single characters, but I could only recognize them, not write them, so I decided: I wanted to learn to write. When I started writing, the main difficulty was forgetting how to write the characters, forgetting them as soon as I wrote them. So I prepared a practice book and carried it with me, learning to write before and after meetings; writing on my belly before going to bed. When I had a certain foundation, I boldly wrote more notes, simple reports and summaries. If I couldn't write a new word, I would replace it with a homophone, not letting it "get stuck." If I really couldn't find a substitute, I would draw an "×" or leave a blank space, and then ask someone else to fill it in later. After fifteen months of hard work, I overcame the difficulties of the initial stage, and recognized about 1,500 single characters, equivalent to a higher primary school education. Then I started practicing writing articles. One month I wrote forty articles, and none of them were published. But I kept writing. Finally, after the Heilongjiang Daily revised it, they published one of my articles, titled "Same Land, Different Harvest." After that, the newspaper hired me as a correspondent, which greatly encouraged my interest and confidence in cultural studies. Now, I am a correspondent for the Northeast Daily, and I also maintain close contact with the People's Daily.

II.

After being transferred to work in the county in 1949, the work requirements were higher, but my culture also had a certain foundation, so I began to study theory and policy, continuing to consolidate and improve my culture in the study of theory. I consulted the county head at the time, Comrade Wen Yi, on learning methods, and he helped me overcome the lofty idea of "carrying big books." I also set a policy for my theoretical study, which was: from shallow to deep, advancing steadily. The first book I read was "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party."

When I first started learning, I encountered many difficulties again. First of all, I couldn't understand it. I didn't understand many nouns and terms, and some sentences, although I recognized all the words, I didn't understand the meaning. In addition, I often encountered some new words. But I thought that no matter what difficulties, as long as I had a firm will and attacked the difficulties tenaciously, I could always overcome them. I saw this sentence from Marx in the magazine "Learning Exchanges": "There is no smooth road in science, only those who climb the rough paths without fear of hardship have the hope of reaching the shining summit." This sentence gave me extremely profound education and made my will to study theory even more determined. In my studies, I realized that studying theory requires diligent inquiry. I diligently asked the leaders (mainly County Party Secretary Comrade Li Shenguang), and diligently asked the general comrades (engaging in discussions with comrades), and when I encountered unfamiliar terms, I looked them up in the dictionary. I also realized that learning theory is different from learning culture. It is not enough to just ask diligently, but more importantly to have a spirit of perseverance. Sometimes a paragraph is difficult to understand, and I often read it three or four times, thinking about it until I understand it. Another difficulty was that the work was busy, and I often had to go to the countryside, sometimes squeezing out study time. When I was learning culture, I overcame this difficulty. Now that I am studying theory, I think I should work harder to overcome this difficulty. I know that studying is like sailing against the current, if you don't advance, you will retreat. If I don't overcome this difficulty, the things I learned in the past cannot be consolidated and improved, then it will stagnate, and there is even a danger of regression. Therefore, I first determined that I must absolutely guarantee study time. During study time, unless there is a very urgent matter, I will definitely not work. I never sleep in late, whether in the office or in the countryside, I do not let go of the good time in the morning. In the morning, the mind is clear, and people are quiet, and the things I learn are remembered firmly. Sometimes I also take time in the evening to study on my own. Secondly, I must ensure that I complete the study plan and complete the reading tasks on time, only allowing myself to finish early, not to delay. For example, I originally planned to finish reading a book in two months, but in reality, I finished reading it in one month and six days. I take books with me when I go to the countryside, and I also take books with me when I go to the province for meetings. Facts have proved that there is definitely time to read books in the countryside. When I go to the province, the time on the train alone is very valuable. Every Sunday and holiday, I maintain at least half a day of study. I deeply realized that the ups and downs in learning are the most undesirable. Therefore, I must never go fishing for three days and dry the nets for two days. Because I squeezed all the time to read, I ensured the regularity of my studies.

However, later in my studies, I gradually developed a mood of greed and rashness. In this way, there were many clues to study, my energy was dispersed, I looked at flowers on horseback, and I gained little. In particular, my research spirit was still very poor. In order to overcome this problem, I streamlined the content of my studies. At the same time, I started taking notes, recording as I learned. In my studies, I linked my actual life and work problems, and tried to do concrete analysis, which helped me understand and deepened my memory. On the other hand, I also made my learning as combined with work as possible, learning what I do. For example, when I was doing Party organizational work, I studied books related to organizational work, such as Lenin's "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back," the Central Committee's Party Rectification documents, etc.; after I started doing government work in 1952, I studied compilations of laws and regulations, etc.; when I was doing rural work, I studied the Central Committee's documents on rural work. Because I persisted in theoretical study, in the past three years, I have read a total of fourteen theoretical books. Some books, such as "History of Social Development," "Introduction to Social Science," and "Political Economy," I read twice each. "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volumes 1, 2, and 3, I read once each, of which "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" I read four times each. In addition, I also read "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Malenkov's "Summary Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the CPSU(B) at the 19th Party Congress," "Reader on the Chinese Revolution," "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China," Lenin's "On Cooperation," and so on. Furthermore, I also read more than twenty novels such as "Virgin Soil Upturned," "Days and Nights," and "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River." These books have all played a great guiding role in my work.

III.

As a result of persisting in theoretical study for several years, I have developed a strong interest in theoretical study. Speaking of the benefits that theoretical study has given me, they are really great. First of all, it has strengthened my class viewpoint. For example, studying "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," "History of Social Development," "Introduction to Social Science," and "Political Economy" gave me a profound class education. Secondly, it enables me to initially use the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint to observe and analyze problems, so that I can make fewer mistakes in my work, and if I make mistakes, I can quickly correct them. After studying the three documents of the Central Committee on rural work in 1953 ("Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation," "Instructions of the CPC Central Committee to Party Committees at All Levels on Spring Plowing Production," and the People's Daily editorial "The Key to Leading Agricultural Production") and Lenin's "On Cooperation," I examined the subjectivism, lack of understanding of the situation, over-planning, and excessive demands that I had made in my work, and improved my work. For example, in promoting the experience of high yields in Zhaoyuan County, I had planned to establish 40,000 hectares of new record-breaking fields in the entire county (the entire county has only 170,000 hectares of fields); in leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement, I did not understand the general trend of national economic development and fantasized about achieving collectivization in the entire county within five years. After studying, I recognized the characteristics of the small-peasant economy, changed the plan according to the actual situation, determined to establish 12,000 hectares of new record-breaking fields in the entire county, and implemented the policy of "key promotion, universal publicity" in practical work. Strengthening theoretical study has also helped me change my leadership style. Now, the number of county-level meetings has been reduced. During the spring plowing and summer weeding this year, 200 office cadres were organized to go to the countryside. After studying "On Contradiction," I am learning to identify and solve the main contradictions in my work, and to focus the leadership's efforts mainly on this aspect. In the past, all documents from all departments were reviewed by the county head. If I didn't look at them for three days, more than 300 copies would accumulate, and as a result, I would be trapped in the circle of affairs, relatively weakening my initiative. Now I have corrected this all-encompassing working method. General documents are handled by each department themselves, and then filed uniformly by the secretariat. Major documents are reviewed by the county head, so that the county head and deputy heads can often go deep into the countryside and concentrate their efforts on studying agricultural problems.

IV.

Under the leadership of the Party, I have gone from a semi-illiterate peasant to being able to study Marxist-Leninist books on my own today. This is indeed a considerable progress. However, I know that my current cultural level and theoretical level are still very low. The revolutionary cause is developing rapidly, and the Party and the people are asking me to improve quickly, but my political and cultural level is still far from the requirements of the work. My theoretical study has just begun. I will continue to move forward steadily without complacency or impetuosity. I must firmly remember the provisions of the Party Constitution: learning is an obligation of Party members. I must also firmly remember the words of Comrade Stalin: "The higher the political level and the degree of Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the staff, the higher and more effective the work itself, and the more effective the results of the work; conversely, the lower the political level and the degree of Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the staff, the more delays and failures in the work." In the future, I will not only study well myself, but also promote the study of the entire county government. Now, in addition to listening to and discussing the "Economic Construction Reader" on time as required by the county party committee's propaganda department, I must also study well "A Short History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union" in order to better learn from the great socialist Soviet Union and strive to complete the historical task of our country's gradual transition to a socialist society.

    我是怎样学习文化和理论的
    黑龙江省青岗县人民政府县长  吕俊峰
    一
    我过去是个穷孩子。从九岁起就放牛、放羊，十一岁、十二岁这二年，在私塾里断断续续地念了一点书，以后就失学了。这以后，不是在家种地，就是给地主扛活，也到煤矿当过劳工。在那些年月里，生活是很苦的，连吃穿都常常顾不上，那有机会学习呢！所以，一九四七年我参加工作的时候，基本上是一个文盲。
    我最早参加的革命斗争是土地改革斗争。那时候，单凭热情工作，认为敢干，肯吃苦，立场稳就行，还没想到学习文化和理论的重要。当时党的土地改革政策是很明确的，都写在“土地法大纲”上了；但是我看不懂文件。区委会议上的政策传达，我也只能用脑子记个大概。这样，在工作中出了不少偏差。例如，对团结中农的政策就没有很好领会，认为中农有财产，过火点没啥。结果，光在我掌握的八区同心村，就错斗了十二户中农，严重地破坏了党的政策。一九四八年，党提出：组织领导农民恢复和发展农业生产，提倡和教育农民走组织起来的新道路。当时我对党的政策并没有弄通，农村工作的前途和方向更不明确，便盲目地组织“大把青”，“伙喂马”，“人在一起吃，马在一槽喂”，结果，经我亲身建立的几个小组，没到夏锄就垮台了。事后，大家告诉我，报纸上批判了这种做法，说这是“农业社会主义的平均主义思想”，但我还是“只听辘辘响，不知井在那”。
    这两次严重的错误，使我万分难过。上级党的指示，各地的工作经验，报上登的很多，可是我看不懂，这就难保工作上不犯错误。以后更深切地感到，没有文化，没有理论，工作愈来愈困难了。当时很多农民出身的干部都有这样的论调：“大老粗吃不开了。”我也曾经动摇过。但是，经过党的教育，特别是在区委会议上批判了悲观情绪之后，我很快地认识了过去的想法不对，从此，下定决心先学好文化，然后再进一步学习理论。
    我的文化学习是从一九四八年三月开始的。开始学习的时候，困难很多：工作忙，经常要下乡，没有固定的老师和学习时间。今天学几个字，明天就忘了，总是记不住。我向水平较高的同志们请教了学习方法，得到的回答是：“恒”“钻”两个字。这给我启发很大。周围的同志又给了我很多热情的鼓励，渐渐地打消了我的“怕麻烦、没时间、成年人记性不好”的想法。我订出了初步计划，决心每天坚持学习两小时，认五个生字，把“黑龙江日报”“新农报”作为教材。我还给自己的文化学习确定了方针：“勤学、勤问、勤写”。这几年来，我是坚决地按着这个方针来做的。第一步我要求做到能认能讲。我请了区委会一位文书做老师，请他每天教给我几个字；下乡的时候，就请教小学教师；有了一点基础，就依靠字典。这一阶段中，遇到的第一个困难是：日以继夜地开会，脑子昏，但我还是坚持了每天两小时的学习。为了争取时间，有时候下乡不骑马，边走边读；冬季夜间读，夏天起早读。但有些字还是记不住。有时一个字问好多遍还记不住。我就利用生字簿，生字旁边注上同音字，帮助记忆，每月有两天专门复习生字。这样做，效果很好。紧接着我便拿起短篇小说如“夏红秋”“活路”等书来读，遇到生字，先撇开，过后再查字典，这帮助我巩固和多认了许多生字。
    一九四八年夏季，单字认了一些了，可是光能认，不会写，我便确定：要学习写字。开始写字的时候，主要的困难是提笔忘字，随写随忘。我便预备好练字簿，随身带着，每逢开会前后，就学写字；睡觉前在肚皮上写。等到又有了一定的基础，我便大胆地多写便条、简单的报告和总结，写不出的生字，用同音字顶替，不让它“卡”住，实在顶不上，便划个“×”或留下空格，事后再请教别人补上。经过十五个月的苦钻苦学，克服了最初阶段的困难，共认识了一千五百个左右的单字，相当于高小文化程度了，紧接着便练习写稿。有一个月我曾写了四十篇稿子，一篇也没有登出。但我还是写。终于经过黑龙江日报社的修改，登了我的一篇稿子，题目是“一样地两样收成”。这以后，报社聘请我当通讯员，大大鼓舞了我的文化学习的兴趣和信心。现在，我已是东北日报的通讯员，并且和人民日报也保持着密切的联系。
    二
    一九四九年调县工作后，工作要求更高了，但我的文化也有了一定的基础，于是便开始了理论、政策的学习，在理论学习中继续巩固和提高文化。我向当时的县长温毅同志请教了学习方法，他帮助我克服了“搬大本子”的好高骛远的思想。我又为自己的理论学习确定了方针，便是：由浅而深、稳步前进。第一本我读的是“中国革命和中国共产党”。
    初学时，又遇到了很多困难，首先是看不懂。许多名词、术语不懂，有的句子，字倒都认得，可是意思不理解。另外，还常常碰到一些生字。但是我以为，不论什么困难，只要意志坚决，顽强地向困难进攻，总是可以克服的。我在“学习往来”这个杂志上，看到了马克思的这句话：“在科学上面是没有平安的大路可走的，只有那在崎岖小路的攀登上不畏劳苦的人，有希望到达光辉的顶点。”这句话给了我极为深刻的教育，使我学习理论的意志更坚定了。在学习中，我体会到，学习理论要勤问才行。我就勤问领导人（主要是问县委书记李深光同志），勤问一般同志（多和同志们展开讨论），遇着不懂得的名词，就翻辞典。我又体会到，学理论和学文化是不同的，光勤问还不行，更要紧的是有钻研精神，有时一段话不好懂，我常常三遍四遍地读它，想它，直到弄懂为止。另一个困难，就是工作忙，下乡多，有时要挤掉学习。学文化时，我克服了这个困难。现在学习理论了，我想更应该努力克服这个困难。我知道，学习好比逆水行舟，不进则退，如果不克服这个困难，过去学习的东西就不能巩固和提高，那便会停顿下来，甚至有倒退的危险。所以，我首先确定，要绝对保证学习时间。学习时间内，除非有十分紧急的事，一定不办公。我是从来不睡早觉的，无论在机关里或乡下，都不放过早晨的好时光。早晨，脑筋清楚，人静，学习的东西记得牢。有时还抽晚上的时间自修。其次，要保证完成学习计划，按时完成阅读任务，只许提前，不许拖延。例如有一本书原计划二个月读完，实际
    一个月零六天就读完了。下乡带着书，上省里开会也带着书。事实证明，下乡是完全有时间读书的。到省里去，光火车上的时间就很宝贵了。每到礼拜天和假日，我至少保持半天的学习。我深深地体会到，学习上的冷热病是最要不得的。所以决不能三天打鱼，两天晒网。由于我挤一切时间来读书，便保证了学习的经常性。
    但是，后来我在学习当中，逐渐产生了贪多冒进的情绪，这样，学习头绪多，精力分散，走马观花，收获不大。特别是钻研性还很差。为了克服这种毛病，我精简了学习内容。同时，开始记笔记，随学随记。在学习中，联系自己的实际生活、联系工作问题，试做具体分析，这既帮助了理解，又加深了记忆。另一方面，我还使自己的学习尽可能和工作结合起来，做什么学什么。比如我作党的组织工作时，就学习有关组织工作的书籍，如列宁的“进一步，退两步”、中央整党文件等；一九五二年作政府工作以后，就学习法令汇编等；在作农村工作时，就学习中央关于农村工作的文件。由于坚持了理论学习，三年多的时间内，我一共阅读了十四本理论书籍，有的书，像“社会发展史”、“社会科学概论”、“政治经济学”，各读了二遍，“毛泽东选集”第一、二、三卷，各读了一遍，其中“矛盾论”和“实践论”各读了四遍，此外还读了“苏联社会主义经济问题”、马林科夫“在十九次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告”、“中国革命读本”、“中国共产党的三十年”、列宁的“论合作制”等等。再，我还看了“被开垦的处女地”、“日日夜夜”、“太阳照在桑干河上”等二十几部小说。这些书籍，都对我的工作起了很大的指导作用。
    三    
    几年来坚持理论学习的结果，我对理论学习有了浓厚兴趣。说到理论学习给我的好处，实在是很大的。首先是加强了阶级观点。例如学习了“中国革命和中国共产党”、“社会发展史”、“社会科学概论”、“政治经济学”，就受到了深刻的阶级教育。其次，使我能初步运用马克思列宁主义的观点来观察和分析问题，使得工作可以少犯错误，有了错误可以迅速得到纠正。一九五三年学习中央关于农村工作的三个文件（“中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议”、“中共中央关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示”、人民日报社论“领导农业生产的关键所在”）和列宁的“论合作制”以后，我检查了自己在工作中所犯的主观主义、不了解下情、计划过大、要求过高等错误，改进了工作。例如，在推广肇源县丰产经验中，我曾计划全县搞四万垧新纪录田（全县仅十七万垧田）；在领导互助合作运动方面，不了解国家经济发展的总趋势，空想在五年内全县达到合作化。经过学习，我认识了小农经济特点，根据实际情况改变了计划，确定全县搞一万二千垧新纪录田，并在实际工作中贯彻了“重点推广、普遍宣传”的方针。加强了理论学习，也帮助我改变着领导作风。现在，县级会议减少了，今年春耕、夏锄期间，各组织了二百名机关干部下乡。学习“矛盾论”后，我正在学习找出和解决工作中的主要的矛盾，并把领导力量主要地放在这方面。过去各科所有文件都经过县长批示，三天不看，就积下三百多份，结果把自己陷于事务圈子，相对地削弱了主动性。现在我已改正了这种包揽的工作方法，一般文件各科自行处理，然后由秘书室统一备案，主要文件经过县长批示，这样正副县长可以经常深入农村，可以集中力量研究农业问题。
    四
    在党的领导下，我从一个半文盲的农民，到今天能够自修马克思列宁主义书籍了。这确实是一个不小的进步。但是，我知道，目前我的文化水平和理论水平还是很低很低的，革命事业一日千里地发展着，党和人民都要求自己迅速提高，而我的政治、文化水平距离工作的要求还很远哩。我的理论学习，还刚刚开始。我要既不自满、也不急躁地继续踏踏实实地前进。我要牢牢地记住党章的规定：学习是党员的一项义务。我也要牢牢地记着斯大林同志的话：“工作人员底政治水准和马克思列宁主义觉悟程度愈高，工作本身也愈高，愈有成效，工作底结果也愈有效力；反过来说，工作人员底政治水准和马克思列宁主义觉悟程度愈低，工作中的延误和失败也愈多”，今后我不但要自己学好，而且要推动整个县政府的学习。现在我除了按县委宣传部规定，按时听讲和讨论经济建设读本外，还要自修好“苏联共产党（布）历史简要读本”，以便更好地向伟大的社会主义苏联学习，为完成我国逐步过渡到社会主义社会的历史任务而努力。
