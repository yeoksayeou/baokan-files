Telling You My Heartfelt Thoughts
Wang Wenbin, Director of Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant

Dear Volunteer Army Comrades:

Every time I encounter a festival, I naturally think of you. Today, as you celebrate the third anniversary of your departure abroad, everything is different from the past: In Korea, you have stopped the slaughter of the American aggressors, the families in the motherland are happier, and more and more factories are being built every day. Also, the first year of our country's economic construction has begun! I want to tell you about the situation of my family and our factory.

I am the director of Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant. There are ten people in my family: my mother, wife, five children, a daughter-in-law, a grandson, and me. My eldest son, Zhiheng, is twenty-seven years old this year. He is a Communist Party member and a good technician. In August two years ago, our People's Government sent him to the Soviet Union to study! Zhiheng has loved reading since he was a child. However, in the old society, it was really difficult for us workers to support a student's education. We barely scraped together some money to support him through elementary school, but we couldn't afford it anymore, so he had to go to the factory as an apprentice. He was only twelve years old at that time. This child is very ambitious. He constantly studied mathematics and physics in the factory. Through his self-study, he became an electrical worker. Later, he approached our underground party organization, and under the education of the underground party, he also gained a clear political understanding. In 1945, he gloriously joined the Communist Party. After the liberation of Beijing, the child's vision became even brighter, and his work and study became more active. Soon, he was elected as the deputy secretary of the party's general branch in the factory.

He had only been married for four months when he went to study in the Soviet Union. At that time, his wife, Yuan Zhengyu, was still a member of the Youth League and worked as a secretary in the factory's trade union. Before leaving, Zhiheng said to her: "I hope that when I return to China, you will already be a Communist Party member!" Zhengyu accepted Zhiheng's entrustment with full confidence and asked him to study hard and not to disappoint the Party's cultivation and education. Good news came from Moscow one after another: In just over half a year, Zhiheng transferred to preparatory studies; soon, he advanced to undergraduate studies half a year ahead of schedule. His academic performance was excellent, with all subjects scoring five. Under the education of the Party and the help of comrades, coupled with Zhiheng's encouragement, Zhengyu's thinking, work, and study progressed rapidly. Finally, in August last year, she gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party.

The other children are also progressing like Zhiheng. My second son, Shuheng, joined the Party soon after liberation. Before graduating from middle school, the organization transferred him to work in the Xidan District Committee of Beijing because of the needs of the Party and the country. He completely obeyed the organization's assignment and happily took up his post. My third son, Maoheng, is studying at Beijing No. 9 Middle School and also joined the Party in April this year. His average score for the last semester was ninety-one. This child has asked to join the Volunteer Army several times, but the higher-ups did not approve it. He was a little unhappy at the time, but after explaining the reason to him, he devoted all his energy to studying. My fourth son, Huiheng, is only ten years old and is studying at the primary school for children of the power plant's employees. He is a member of the Young Pioneers. His personality is different from his older brothers; he loves to jump and is very naughty. But his studies are also good, with scores mostly around four or five. He naively said: "When my eldest brother comes back, and when the Volunteer Army uncles also come back, I will also be in middle school, and I guarantee I will be a member of the Youth League!"

Usually, the family is relatively quiet. But when Sunday comes, it's like a holiday, and the house becomes lively. The old grandmother is busy soliciting opinions, planning the meals according to everyone's wishes. The little grandson crawls around on the bed, playing with the toys Zhiheng sent back from Moscow. The children all talk about their work, study, and the new things they have seen. They talk about everything from school to the factory, from bookstores to cinemas, and sometimes they argue about the content of a novel. After dinner, the radio starts broadcasting beautiful music, and the children sing and dance along with the music. Sometimes, the old grandmother joins in with a few words. The old grandmother is already seventy-four years old, but she is old but not outdated. She likes to sing "The East is Red" and do the Yangko dance. Usually, she likes to ask Huiheng to tell her stories about your battles, but Huiheng, this child, always complains that his grandmother's ears are a bit deaf, and he gets impatient after only saying a few words. There is no other way, so the grandmother goes to the square in front of the door to listen to the factory's broadcast. Once, she went to the factory to see the movie "Resist America, Aid Korea." Your victory caused a long applause from the audience, but the old grandmother couldn't clap her hands loudly. From that time on, she always practiced clapping her hands at home while coaxing the child to play. She said: "Next time, I must clap louder!"

Dear comrades, seeing this, it is difficult for you to imagine my past situation! Thirty-four years ago, I was only sixteen years old, forced by life, and came to Shijingshan from the countryside. At that time, it was still a desolate graveyard, with only a few dilapidated earthen houses scattered at the foot of the mountain. On this desolate land, we built factory buildings and installed machines. However, at that time, the factory belonged to the British, Germans, Japanese, and Kuomintang reactionaries. The hard work of the workers was exchanged for days of hunger and starvation. Many old comrades lost their lives due to hunger and cold and were buried in that dark gully. In 1942, Zhiheng broke his arm, and I was also given a "crime" by the reactionaries and imprisoned. There was no other way, so the old mother took the whole family back to her hometown and started a life of begging.

But, you know, comrades, the working class will never succumb to the threats of the reactionaries. After I was released from prison, under the leadership of the underground party, Zhiheng and I continued to fight. We exposed the crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries to the workers and organized workers to strike. Zhiheng also risked danger to collect important information from the factory and supply it to our party. Only after liberation did I know that Zhiheng and I were not only father and son, but had been comrades for a long time!

After the working class became the masters of the factory, everyone was working and studying diligently. We overcame difficulties such as old machines, insufficient supplies, and lack of materials... We repaired the machines, established a scientific system of regular overhauls, and reduced coal consumption by three percent, which can save the country more than 4,000 tons of coal every year. Last year, the factory learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and successfully test-burned low-quality coal, which can save the country hundreds of billions of wealth every year. Now, in response to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, and to commemorate the third anniversary of your departure abroad to fight, all the employees of the factory are determined to accumulate funds and increase production and practice economy by 21 billion wealth for the country, and are determined to support the restoration and construction of the Korean people and support your efforts for the final peaceful settlement of the Korean issue!

### 给你们说一说心底话

    给你们说一说心底话
    北京市石景山发电厂厂长  王文斌亲爱的志愿军同志们：
    每次碰到个啥节日，我就很自然地想到你们。今天，当你们出国三周年的时候，一切和过去又不一样了：在朝鲜，你们已经制止了美国侵略者的屠杀，祖国的家庭更幸福了，工厂也一天天地多起来。还有，咱们国家的经济建设的第一年，已经开始了！我要告诉你们的，是我的家庭和我们工厂的一些情形。
    我是北京市石景山发电厂的厂长。家中共十口人：母亲、妻子、五个孩子、一个儿媳妇、孙子和我。大儿子志恒，今年二十七岁，是共产党员，又是一个不错的技术工人。前年八月，咱们的人民政府已经把他送到苏联去学习了！志恒从小就喜欢念书。可是，在旧社会，咱们工人供养一个学生读书可真不容易。勉强凑了几个钱，供他小学毕业后，就再也供不起了，只好进了工厂当学徒。那时他才十二岁。这个孩子很有志气，他在厂子里不断钻研数学和物理，就靠着他的自学，当上了电气工人。后来，他又接近了我们地下党的组织，在地下党的教育下，他在政治上也认识清楚了。一九四五年，他光荣地加入了共产党。北京解放后，孩子的眼光更亮了，工作、学习更积极。很快，就被选上了厂子里党总支的副书记。
    他去苏联学习时，刚刚结婚四个月。那时，他的妻子袁正宇还是一个青年团员，在厂子的工会里做秘书工作。临走，志恒对她说：“希望我回国时，你已经是个共产党员！”正宇满怀信心地接受了志恒的嘱托，并要他努力学习，不要辜负党的培养和教育。喜讯从莫斯科一次又一次地传来：半年多的功夫，志恒就转入了预科学习；很快，又提前半年到本科学习了。学习的成绩很好，每门功课都是五分。正宇在党的教育和同志们的帮助下，再加上志恒对她的鼓舞，使她的思想、工作和学习都飞快地进步，终于去年八月光荣地参加了中国共产党。
    别的孩子，也和志恒一样地前进着。二儿子恕恒，解放后不久就入了党。中学还没毕业，因为党和国家的需要，组织上便调他到北京西单区区委会去工作。他完全服从了组织上的分配，欢欢喜喜地走上了工作岗位。三儿子懋恒，在北京市立九中念书，今年四月间也入了党。上学期的学习成绩，平均分数是九十一分。这孩子，曾经好几次要求参加志愿军，上级没有批准，他当时有点不高兴，可是，一经和他说明道理后，他便把全副精力，都贯注到学习上了。四儿子惠恒，才十岁，在发电厂职工子弟小学校念书，是少年先锋队的队员。他的个性，和他的几个哥哥都不一样，爱蹦爱跳的，非常淘气。可是学习也还不错，成绩大都在四分、五分左右。他天真地说：“等我大哥回来了，那时志愿军叔叔也回来了，我也上了中学，还保证是个青年团员哩！”
    平常，家里比较寂静。可是一到星期天，真像过节一样，家中就热闹起来。老奶奶忙着征求意见，她要按着大家的心愿筹划饭菜。小孙孙在床上爬来爬去，玩着志恒从莫斯科寄回来的玩具。孩子们都交谈着自己的工作、学习和自己所看到的新鲜事儿。他们从学校谈到工厂，从书店谈到电影院，有时，就为一本小说的内容争吵起来。饭后，收音机开始播送着优美的音乐，孩子们随着音乐声，唱起来，跳起来。有时，老奶奶也和上几句。老奶奶已经七十四岁了，可是人老心不老。她最喜欢唱“东方红”，扭秧歌。平常，她老喜欢叫惠恒给她讲你们的战斗故事，可是惠恒这孩子，老嫌奶奶的耳朵有点聋，讲不上几句，就不耐烦了。没有办法，奶奶就到门前的广场上，去听厂子里的广播。有一次，她到工厂里去看“抗美援朝”的电影，你们的胜利，引起观众长久的掌声，可是老奶奶总是拍不响。打那时起，她在家哄孩子玩时，总是练习拍巴掌。她说：“再一次，我可要拍得响一点！”
    亲爱的同志们，看到这里，你们很难想像到我的过去情景吧！三十四年前，我才十六岁，受生活的逼迫，从乡下来到石景山。那时，这里还是一片荒凉的坟地，仅山脚下散落着几间破土房。就在这块荒凉的土地上，我们修起了厂房，安装了机器。可是，那时的工厂，是属于英国人、德国人、日本人和国民党反动派的，工人们的辛勤劳动，换来的是忍饥挨饿的日子。许多老同伴，都在饥寒交迫下丧失了自己的生命，埋葬在那阴暗的山沟里。一九四二年，志恒摔断了胳臂，我也叫反动派加上“罪名”，被捕入狱了。没有办法，老母亲又带着一家大小，返回了家乡，开始乞讨的生活。
    可是，你们知道，同志们，工人阶级绝不会在反动派的威胁下面屈服的。我出狱后，在地下党的领导下，和志恒仍然坚持着斗争。我们向工人们揭发国民党反动派的罪恶，组织工人怠工。志恒还冒着危险，汇集工厂里的重要情况，供给我们的党。解放后，我才知道：我和志恒不仅是父子，而且很早就是同志了！
    工人阶级做了工厂的主人后，大家都在紧张地劳动和学习着。我们克服了机器破旧、供应不足、材料缺乏……的困难，修起了机器，建立了定期大检修的科学制度，降低了煤耗百分之三，每年可给国家节省四千多吨煤的财富。去年，厂内学习了苏联的先进经验，试烧低质煤成功，每年又可给国家节省上百亿的财富。现在，为了响应毛主席增产节约的号召，为了纪念你们出国作战三周年，全厂职工决心为国家积累资金、增产节约二百一十亿的财富，决心支援朝鲜人民的恢复和建设，支援你们为朝鲜问题最后和平解决而作的努力！
