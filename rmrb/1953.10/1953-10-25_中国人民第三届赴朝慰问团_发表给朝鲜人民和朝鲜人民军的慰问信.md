Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 24th: The Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea has launched extensive慰问 activities in various parts of Korea and issued a letter of慰问 to the Korean people and all comrades of the Korean People's Army. The full text of the letter of慰问 is as follows:

Dear Korean people and all comrades of the Korean People's Army:

The Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, entrusted by all the people of our country, has come to heroic Korea after the signing of the armistice agreement to express to you, to the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army who have won glorious victory in the war to defend their motherland, the lofty respect and warm慰问 of the people of our country, feeling infinite excitement and joy.

More than three years ago, the most ferocious, cruel, and shameless American imperialist bandits and the Syngman Rhee gang launched a war of aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, ravaged your territory, and destroyed your peaceful and happy life. The heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army raised the banner of resistance against aggression and defense of the peaceful Fatherland Liberation War. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, together with the Chinese People's Volunteers in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and with the sympathy and support of the world's peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people around the world, they carried out a heroic struggle and finally defeated the enemy, forcing the arrogant American aggressors to accept the armistice. This is a great victory for the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, a great victory for the Korean and Chinese people against American aggression, and a great victory for the world peace and democracy camp. We extend our deepest congratulations to you.

The great victory of the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army over the American aggressors not only defended the independence and freedom of the Korean people but also defended peace in the Far East, disrupting the American imperialists' plan to expand their war of aggression. The heroic Korean people have written a glorious page in the history of liberation struggles, inspiring the liberation movements of all oppressed peoples and nations. Comrade Malenkov said: "Today, the word 'Korean' has become a symbol of the great and resolute national spirit, a symbol of lofty and selfless service for the freedom and independence of the motherland." The Chinese people feel deeply honored to have such heroic people as neighbors and friends.

The people of China and Korea are as close as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe. In the past, the people of the two countries fought heroically together against the Japanese aggressors. Now, in the struggle against the common enemy, the American aggressors, the people of the two countries have forged a close fighting friendship with blood. This friendship is eternal and unbreakable. The solid unity between the people of China and Korea is a strong fortress guaranteeing peace in the Far East. May this glorious friendship between our two peoples continue to develop.

Now, the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement has opened the road to a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. However, we deeply know that the enemy will not be reconciled to defeat. American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee gang are colluding with each other, systematically carrying out conspiracies to undermine the Korean armistice, and doing everything possible to obstruct and sabotage the convening of a political conference. Therefore, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies must be a hundred times more vigilant, strictly guard their positions, and be prepared to crush any sudden invasion by the enemy at any time, and fulfill the glorious task of defending peace. The Chinese people will continue to deepen the movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, in order to consolidate the Korean armistice, strictly prevent the resurgence of the war of aggression, until the Korean issue is resolved peacefully.

The Korean people have suffered deep war disasters in the war. The American aggressors inhumanly destroyed your homes and massacred your relatives. Now you are facing the urgent task of healing the wounds of war and restoring peaceful life. The great Soviet Union and the people's democratic brother countries have all decided to provide full assistance to the peaceful construction of the Korean people. In this regard, the Chinese people are willing to do their utmost.

The Chinese people firmly believe that the heroic Korean people, who have defeated the American imperialist aggressors, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, will be more united, heighten their vigilance, defeat all the conspiracies and sabotage activities of the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee gang, and build a peaceful, unified, and independent Korea. Comrades, work hard! We wish you greater achievements in the future.

Long live the great Fatherland Liberation War victory of the Korean people!
Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!
Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung, the respected leader of the Korean people!

    中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团
    发表给朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军的慰问信
    【新华社平壤二十四日电】中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团，已在朝鲜各地展开了广泛的慰问活动，并发表了给朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军全体同志的慰问信。慰问信全文如下：亲爱的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军全体同志们：
    中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团，这次受我国全体人民的委托，在停战协定签字之后来到英雄的朝鲜，向你们，向在保卫自己祖国的战争中获得了光辉胜利的英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，表达我国人民对你们的崇高的敬意和热烈的慰问，感到无限的兴奋和愉快。
    三年多以前，世界上最凶恶、最残酷、最无耻的美帝国主义强盗和李承晚匪帮发动了侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的战争，蹂躏了你们的国土，破坏了你们和平幸福的生活。英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，举起了反抗侵略、保卫和平的祖国解放战争的旗帜，在朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅领导下，与抗美援朝的中国人民志愿军一起，在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营以及全世界一切爱好和平人民的同情和支援下，进行了英勇的斗争，终于打败了敌人，使骄横不可一世的美国侵略者不得不接受停战。这是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的伟大胜利，是朝中人民反对美国侵略战争的伟大胜利，是世界和平民主阵营的伟大胜利。我们谨向你们致深切的祝贺。
    英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军战胜美国侵略者的伟大胜利，不仅保卫了朝鲜人民的独立和自由，并且保卫了远东的和平，打乱了美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的计划。英雄的朝鲜人民在解放斗争史上写下了光辉的一页，鼓舞了一切被压迫人民、民族的解放运动。马林科夫同志说：“今天，朝鲜人这个字眼已成为了伟大的刚毅的民族精神的象征，成为了为祖国的自由与独立而从事崇高的忘我的服务的象征。”中国人民深深以有这样英雄的人民为邻邦和朋友而感到光荣。
    中朝两国人民唇齿相依，休戚与共。在过去，两国人民曾在一起共同对日本侵略者作过英勇的斗争，现在在反对共同敌人美国侵略者的斗争中，两国人民更是以鲜血结成了亲密的战斗友谊，这个友谊是永远的，是牢不可破的。中朝两国人民之间的巩固团结，是保障远东和平的坚强堡垒。愿我们两国人民的这个光辉友谊不断地向前发展。
    现在，朝鲜停战协定签字已打开了和平解决朝鲜问题的道路。但是，我们深知：敌人是不会甘心于失败的。美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮正在狼狈为奸，有计划地进行破坏朝鲜停战的阴谋，并千方百计阻挠和破坏政治会议的召开。因此，朝中人民军队还必须百倍警惕，严守自己的阵地，准备随时粉碎敌人任何的突然侵犯，完成保卫和平的光荣任务。中国人民将继续深入地开展抗美援朝运动，支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，以巩固朝鲜停战，严防侵略战争的再起，直到朝鲜问题和平解决为止。
    朝鲜人民在战争中遭受了深重的战争灾难。美国侵略者灭绝人性地毁灭了你们的家园，屠杀了你们的亲人。现在你们正面临着医治战争创伤，恢复和平生活的迫切任务。伟大的苏联和各人民民主兄弟国家对于朝鲜人民的和平建设，都决定进行充分的援助。中国人民在这个方面，愿意尽自己的最大努力。
    中国人民完全相信，战胜了美帝国主义侵略者的英雄的朝鲜人民，在朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅领导下，一定会更加团结一致，提高警惕，击破美帝国主义者及李承晚匪帮的一切阴谋破坏活动，建立和平、统一、独立的朝鲜。同志们，努力吧！祝你们今后获得更伟大的成就。
    朝鲜人民伟大的祖国解放战争胜利万岁！
    中朝两国人民的牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
    朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅万岁！
    中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团
    一九五三年十月
