　　Chairman, fellow delegates, distinguished guests:

　　On behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions with its 10.2 million members, I extend my heartfelt and fraternal congratulations to the Third World Trade Union Congress. We warmly support Louis Saillant's report.

　　Our congress is being held at a time when the unity of the world's working class is constantly strengthening, the struggle to defend the interests of working people has achieved great victories, and the world peace movement is developing unprecedentedly.

　　Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese working class has carried out more than 30 years of heroic struggle, and in the revolutionary struggle established the closest alliance with the broad masses of peasants, gaining enormous assistance from the peasants. At the same time, it established a revolutionary united front with other democratic classes, thus forming a powerful revolutionary force, defeating foreign imperialism and domestic counter-revolution, winning the victory of the people's great revolution, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship after the victory of the revolution, supporting the victorious struggle against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and completing the restoration of the national economy. These are all great historical victories.

　　The victory of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people is the victory of the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin in China. Without Marxism-Leninism, without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, there would be no victory for the Chinese working class and the Chinese people. The great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party is the guarantee of our victory. The great Comrade Mao Zedong is the banner of victory for the Chinese working class and the Chinese people.

　　In the struggle of the great people's revolution, the broad masses of the Chinese working class demonstrated boundless courage and diligence, contributed their wisdom, and fulfilled the responsibilities they shouldered in history.

　　During the liberation of various cities across the country, the Chinese working class heroically carried out the struggle to protect factories and protect the people's property. After the liberation of the cities, the trade union organizations assisted the people's government in taking over the bureaucratic capitalist enterprises, transforming the bureaucratic capitalist enterprises into socialist enterprises, and quickly restoring production order.

　　Our trade union is no longer the organization of the oppressed and ruled class, but the mass organization of the leading class and the ruling class of the country. The most important task of the trade union is to unite and lead all workers, engineers, technicians, and staff members to consciously and actively struggle to improve labor productivity. Because improving labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important and primary condition for ensuring the victory of the new social system.

　　The Chinese working class, which has become the leading class of the country, is laboring for its own happy life for the first time ever, creating the possibility of truly large-scale and truly broad application of labor emulation. The broad masses of workers participated in the emulation, in which they demonstrated their great collective strength and firm will, gave play to their wisdom, and revealed the talents that had long been suppressed, ravaged, and suffocated under the dark rule of the old China. This wisdom and talent have become an inexhaustible source of power for peaceful construction in the new China. For example, Zhang Mingshan, an ordinary worker at the small rolling mill of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company, with the help of Soviet experts and the close cooperation of technical personnel, created a reverse collar on the finishing mill, automating the steel rolling production process.

　　Young female textile worker Hao Jianxiu created a fine spinning method, and the 1951 weaving method collectively created by weaving workers, after being promoted nationwide, due to the active efforts of workers across the country, the total output of yarn and cloth in 1952 exceeded the highest annual output in the history of China's textile industry by more than 50 percent.

　　The Chinese working class, which has become the leading class of the country, not only undertakes the glorious task of completing the national industrial plan, but also undertakes the important responsibility of helping agricultural production gradually implement socialist transformation.

　　In the past four years, we have achieved brilliant successes in restoring and developing industry, transportation, and agriculture. On the basis of the achievements in economic construction, the material and cultural living standards of the national working people have also been continuously improved and raised.

　　By 1952, in terms of industrial production: major products other than raw coal, such as pig iron, steel, steel products, electricity, crude oil, electrolytic copper, soda ash, cement, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, paper, sugar, etc., had all exceeded the highest annual output in our country's history. Taking the output of 1949 as the base, pig iron in 1952 was 7.5 times, steel was 9.4 times, steel products were 8.2 times, electricity was 1.8 times, coal was 2 times, crude oil was 3.1 times, electrolytic copper was 10.2 times, soda ash was 1.9 times, caustic soda was 5.2 times, cement was 3.5 times, and timber was 2.2 times, cotton cloth was 2.3 times.

　　In terms of agricultural production: the national grain output in 1952 reached 3.275 billion dan, exceeding the highest output in our country's history; the national cotton output reached 25.84 million dan, nearly double that of 1949, exceeding the highest annual output in history by about 50 percent; other technical crops have also increased. In line with the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, our country has also recovered and greatly developed in foreign and domestic trade and transportation. In 1952, foreign trade imports and exports had been balanced; the railway freight turnover increased by 48 percent compared with the highest level in history.

　　We have victoriously completed the task of restoring the national economy. The Chinese working class, with perseverance, overcame the various difficulties encountered in the process of our country's economic recovery and development. And with the sincere, selfless, brotherly assistance of our great ally – the Soviet government and the Soviet people – and the friendly support of various people's democratic countries, we completed the historical task during our country's economic recovery period. From this year, our country has begun to implement the first five-year construction plan that the people of the whole country have longed for.

　　On the basis of the rapid recovery and development of our national economy, the cultural education and material welfare of the Chinese working class and the Chinese working people are constantly being improved and raised. The miserable and impoverished life that the Chinese working class lived under the long-term cruel exploitation and oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism has disappeared forever.

　　In our country, after the working class seized power, the purpose of restoring and developing the national economy and expanding social production is to gradually meet the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the working people of the whole country.

　　The wages of state-owned enterprise employees increased by 60 to 120 percent in 1952 compared to 1949, and the wage levels and wage systems of private enterprise employees have also been improved and raised. The lives of the Chinese working people have been greatly improved. For example, Jing Xiuchuan, an inspector at the Changchun Locomotive Depot of the Harbin Railway Administration, starved to death his mother, brothers, and daughters before liberation. When he was first liberated, he had nothing but the clothes on his back. With the development of production in this section, he received five wage increases and is now well-fed and clothed. The living standards of workers across the country in the new China are generally improving day by day. Moreover, the improvement of workers' lives is not limited to wage increases. The stability of prices, the establishment of various social undertakings, and other measures to improve workers' welfare have all become important factors in improving workers' lives, and this factor is growing in our country's economic construction.

　　The improvement of the lives of Chinese workers is reflected in the continuous growth in the consumption of daily necessities. For example, Chengdu City in the southwest region, which was liberated later, taking the second half of 1949 as the base, the consumption of daily necessities in the same period in 1952 increased to 169 for food, 123 for fuel, and 410 for clothing. For example, in the first half of 1953, the sales volume of meat and eggs in the Northeast region increased by 67.2 percent compared with the same period last year, and the finished clothing increased by 127.7 percent. The continuous improvement of the consumption of daily necessities is a clear sign of the improvement of the lives of the Chinese people.

　　People's governments at all levels and trade union organizations are actively trying to improve the living conditions of workers. Large-scale worker residential areas have been built in many cities. In 1952 alone, the state paid more than 286 billion yuan to build dormitories for one million workers. Just before the May 1st Labor Day this year, more than 500 families of construction workers, electricity workers, and transportation workers in Chongqing moved into spacious new homes. In Guangzhou, more than 26,000 workers and their families moved into new homes. The Tianjin Workers' New Village will also be completed, and most of the public buildings in the new village have been completed: three primary schools have more than 1,700 workers' children studying, two kindergartens have been arranged, the health center has begun to provide medical services, and a health exhibition is being held. Many workers' families are visiting with their children. More than 5,000 households, more than 20,000 people, have already lived in the new village. Many workers are about to move in. For example, Yaoshui Lane in Putuo District, Shanghai, where about 10,000 workers' families live, was filled with garbage everywhere before liberation. There was no sewer system, and it was difficult to walk in the mud after a rainy day. The sanitary conditions were poor, and epidemics were rampant, resulting in a high mortality rate. After liberation, sewers were built, tap water faucets were installed, street lights were installed in large and small lanes, the worst roads were renovated, water storage ponds were added, and the living conditions of workers were improved.

　　The scope of labor insurance enjoyed by the Chinese working class is expanding day by day. Labor insurance was implemented in the Northeast region, which was liberated earlier, in 1949. In 1951, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the Labor Insurance Regulations. Employees of public and private factories and mines with more than 100 people nationwide have enjoyed labor insurance benefits, and most enterprises with fewer than 100 people have also signed labor insurance collective contracts. In 1952, the number of workers enjoying labor insurance increased to 4.9 times that of 1949, and the number of people enjoying recuperation and rest increased to 6 times that of 1950 in 1952. The labor insurance costs of our country are not borne by the workers themselves, but are entirely borne by the enterprise administration and the capitalists. The state's expenditure on labor insurance reached more than 160 billion yuan in 1952 alone. There are more than 3,000 collective welfare undertakings such as workers' sanatoriums, rest homes, nurseries, after-work sanatoriums, and nursing homes funded directly by the state, by enterprise bonus funds, and by labor insurance funds. Our country's beautiful cities have become areas for our working class to recuperate. The Chinese working class has experienced the boundless care and warmth of the motherland from their actual lives, which undeniably proves the superiority of the people's democratic social system.

　　While implementing the increase in production and thrift, we pay attention to the safety, health, and essential welfare undertakings of employees. Therefore, trade union organizations are always concerned with and try to improve the material and cultural lives of the working masses as much as possible.

　　During the Kuomintang reactionary rule, the Chinese working class was subjected to heavy oppression by imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic bourgeoisie. They had to work more than 12 hours a day under heavy and harsh working conditions. In the eyes of imperialists and capitalists, workers were simply regarded as cattle and horses. Their personality was insulted, their work was not guaranteed at all, and they were often subjected to their beatings, scoldings, insults, dismissals, killings, and other oppressions. Even entering and leaving the factory, they had to be searched all over. Even bowel movements were strictly restricted during work. Under these unbearable harsh working conditions, phenomena such as premature aging, injuries and illnesses, work-related disabilities, and deaths among working people were extremely serious. An old miner in the Hunan Tin Mine recalled the tragic situation in the past and said: "There were more than 300 people who worked with me, and now only 20 or so are left. The rest have died of illness; one family of six has only one left who is still suffering from lung disease." In the new China, this situation has been fundamentally changed.

　　In our country, the working hours of workers, in the state-owned enterprises nationwide, have implemented the eight-hour working system, and departments that are harmful to health have been shortened to six hours.

　　Chinese trade union organizations assist enterprise administrations in conducting technical safety education for the broad masses of workers on a regular basis. Workers can receive protective equipment such as masks, gloves, and work clothes on time according to their work needs. For workers working in departments that are harmful to health, enterprise administrations provide free health foods such as milk and eggs.

    在世界工会第三次代表大会十二日上午会议上
    我国代表团团长刘宁一的发言
    主席、各位代表、各位来宾：
    我代表中华全国总工会一千零二十万会员，向世界工会第三次代表大会致以衷心的、兄弟般的祝贺。我们热烈支持路易·赛扬的报告。
    我们的这次大会，是正当世界工人阶级的团结不断加强，为保卫劳动人民本身利益的斗争获得巨大胜利，世界和平运动空前发展的时候召开的。
    中国工人阶级在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下进行了三十余年英勇的斗争，并且在革命斗争中同广大的农民群众建立了最密切的联盟，从农民方面取得了极大的助力，同时，又同其他的民主阶级建立了革命的统一战线，因此，组成了强大的革命力量，战胜了外国帝国主义和国内反革命，赢得了人民大革命的胜利，在革命胜利之后，又巩固了人民民主专政，支持了抗美援朝的胜利斗争，完成了国民经济的恢复工作。这些都是伟大的历史性的胜利。
    中国工人阶级和中国人民的胜利，就是马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说在中国的胜利。没有马克思、列宁主义，没有中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导，就不会有中国工人阶级和中国人民的胜利。伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党是我们胜利的保证。伟大的毛泽东同志是中国工人阶级和中国人民胜利的旗帜。
    在伟大的人民大革命的斗争中，中国工人阶级的广大群众表现了无限的勇敢和勤劳，贡献了自己的智慧，尽了自己在历史上所应该担当的责任。
    中国工人阶级在全国各个城市的解放过程中，英勇地进行了护厂斗争，保护了人民的财产。在城市解放之后，工会组织协助人民政府接管了官僚资本的企业，把官僚资本主义性质的企业变成为社会主义性质的企业，并迅速地恢复了生产秩序。
    我们的工会，已经不是被压迫、被统治的阶级组织，而是国家的领导阶级、执政阶级的群众组织了。工会头等重要的任务就是团结和带领全体工人、工程技术人员和职员，自觉地、积极地为提高劳动生产率而斗争。因为提高劳动生产率，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的条件。
    已经成为国家领导阶级的中国工人阶级，破天荒第一次为自己的幸福生活而劳动，这样，造成真正大规模地、真正广阔地运用劳动竞赛的可能，广大工人群众参加了竞赛，在竞赛中，工人群众显现了自己伟大的集体力量和坚定的意志，发挥了自己的智慧，表露出在旧中国的黑暗统治下长期地被压抑、蹂躏和窒息了的才干，这种智慧和才干在新中国已成为和平建设力量的无穷尽的泉源。如国营鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂的一个普通工人张明山，在得到了苏联专家的帮助和技术人员的密切合作下，创造了精轧机上的反围盘，使轧钢生产过程自动化。
    青年纺织女工郝建秀创造了细纱工作法，和织布工人集体创造的一九五一织布工作法，在全国范围内推行以后，由于全国工人的积极努力，一九五二年纱布的总产量已超过了中国纺织工业历史上最高年产量百分之五十以上。
    已经成为国家领导阶级的中国工人阶级，不但担负着完成国家工业计划的光荣任务，同时也担负着帮助农业生产逐步实行社会主义改造的重大责任。
    四年来，我们在恢复与发展工业、交通运输和农业各方面获得了辉煌的成就，在经济建设的成就的基础上，全国劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平也得到不断的改善和提高。
    到一九五二年为止，在工业生产方面：主要产品除原煤以外，其他如生铁、钢、钢材、电力、原油、电铜、纯碱、水泥、棉纱、棉布、纸、糖等均已超过我国历史上最高年产量。如以一九四九年的产量为基数，则一九五二年生铁为七点五倍，钢为九点四倍，钢材为八点二倍，电力为一点八倍，煤为二倍，原油为三点一倍，电铜为一○点二倍，纯碱为一点九倍，烧碱为五点二倍，水泥为三点五倍，木材为二点二倍，棉布为二点三倍。
    在农业生产方面：一九五二年全国粮食产量已达三十二亿七千五百万担，超过了我国历史上最高产量；全国棉花产量已达二千五百八十四万担，将近一九四九年的两倍，约超过历史上最高年产量百分之五十左右；其他技术作物亦有增加。与工农业生产的恢复和发展相适应，我国在国内外贸易和交通运输等方面，也得到恢复，并有了很大发展。一九五二年国外贸易出入口已经平衡；铁路货运周转量比历史上最高水平增加了百分之四十八。
    我们已经胜利地完成了国民经济的恢复工作。中国工人阶级以坚忍不拔的毅力，克服了横在我国经济的恢复与发展过程中所遇到的各种困难。并在我们的伟大盟邦——苏联政府和苏联人民的真诚无私的兄弟般的援助之下，和各人民民主国家的友谊的支持之下，我们完成了在我国经济恢复时期的历史任务。从今年起，我国已开始执行为全国人民渴望已久的我国第一个五年建设计划。
    在我国国民经济迅速地恢复与发展的基础上，中国工人阶级和中国劳动人民的文化教育和物质福利，不断地获得改善与提高。过去在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的长期的残酷的剥削和压迫下中国工人阶级所过的那种悲惨贫困的生活，已经永远地消逝了。
    在我们国家，工人阶级取得政权之后，恢复与发展国民经济，扩大社会生产的目的，就是逐步地满足全国劳动人民经常增长的物质和文化的需要。
    国营企业职工的工资一九五二年比一九四九年增加了百分之六十到一百二十，私营企业职工的工资水平和工资制度也有改善和提高。中国劳动人民的生活已有了很大的改善，如哈尔滨铁路管理局长春机务段验收员靖秀川在解放前饿死了母亲、兄弟、女儿。刚解放时，他除了身上的衣服外，什么也没有。随着本段生产发展，他提高了五次工资，现在是丰衣足食。新中国全国工人的生活水平普遍地日益改善。而且工人生活的改善并不仅限于工资的提高。物价的稳定，各种社会事业的举办，以及其他增进工人福利的措施，都已成为改善工人生活的重要因素，而且这种因素在我国经济建设的过程中还在日益增长着。
    中国工人生活的改善，表现在生活日用品的消费量的不断增长。例如，西南地区的成都市，是解放较晚的一个城市，工人生活日用品的消费量以一九四九年下半年为基数，一九五二年同期的食物增加为一六九，燃料为一二三，衣著为四一○。又如东北地区一九五三年上半年肉蛋销售量较去年同期增加百分之六十七点二，衣著成品增加了百分之一二七点七。生活日用品的消费量的不断提高，是中国人民生活改善的明显的标志。
    各级人民政府和工会组织积极设法改善着工人的居住条件，在许多城市都大批地修建了工人住宅区，仅在一九五二年一年，国家就支付二万八千六百余亿元的款项，建造了可供一百万工人居住的宿舍。就在今年五一劳动节前夕，重庆已经有五百多户建筑工人、电业工人和运输工人的家庭迁入宽敞的新居。广州有两万六千多工人和他们的眷属住到新住宅去。天津的工人新村也将落成，新村的公共建筑已经大部修完：三个小学校有一千七百多个工人子弟在读书，两所幼儿院已经布置好，卫生所已开始应诊，卫生展览会正在举行，许多工人家属带着孩子在参观。新村里已住了五千多户，两万多人。还有许多工人正要搬去住。又如上海普陀区药水弄，住一万左右工人家属，解放前弄内到处堆积垃圾，无下水道，下一天雨泥泞难行，卫生条件恶劣，疫疠流行，死亡率很高。解放后，修了下水道，装上了自来水龙头，大小弄堂装上路灯，翻修了最坏的马路，增筑了蓄水池，改善了工人居住条件。
    中国工人阶级享受劳动保险的范围日益扩大了。解放较早的东北地区，在一九四九年即已实行劳动保险。一九五一年中央人民政府政务院颁布了劳动保险条例，在全国范围内，百人以上的公私厂矿企业的职工均已享受劳动保险的待遇，百人以下的企业亦多签订了劳动保险集体合同。一九五二年享受劳动保险的工人数已增加到一九四九年的四点九倍，享受疗养、休养的人数，一九五二年已增加为一九五○年的六倍。我们国家的劳动保险费，不是由工人自己负担的，而是完全由企业行政和资方负担的。国家用于劳动保险方面的经费，仅一九五二年即达一万六千余亿元。由国家直接投资及由企业奖励基金以及劳动保险基金举办的工人疗养院、休养所、托儿所、业余疗养所、养老院等集体福利事业，共有三千余处。我国风景美丽的城市已成为我们工人阶级疗养的地区。中国工人阶级从实际生活中体验到祖国的无限关怀与温暖，这也无庸争辩地证明了人民民主社会制度的优越性。
    我们在实施增产节约的同时，注意职工的安全、健康和必不可少的福利事业。因此，工会组织时刻地关心与尽可能地改善工人群众的物质生活和文化生活。
    中国工人阶级在国民党反动统治时期，受帝国主义、封建势力、官僚资产阶级的重重压迫，每天要在繁重的恶劣劳动条件下做十二小时以上的工作。在帝国主义者和资本家的心目中，工人简直被当作牛马一样看待，人格受侮辱，工作得不到丝毫保障，经常受他们的打骂，污辱，开除、残杀等压迫，甚至连平常出入工厂遍身都要受搜查，工作中连大小便都受到严格限制。在这种令人难于忍受的恶劣劳动条件之下，劳动人民早衰、伤病、因工残废、死亡等现象是极其严重的。湖南锡矿的一个老矿工在回忆过去的悲惨境况时说：“和我在一块做工的原来有三百多人，现在只剩下二十多人，其余的都病死了；有一家父子六人，现在只剩下一个还是患肺病的。”在新中国，已经把这种情况根本地加以改变了。
    在我们国家的工人工作时间，在全国范围内，国营企业方面，已实行了八小时工作制，有损健康的部门已缩短为六小时。
    中国工会组织协助企业行政经常对广大工人群众进行技术安全教育。工人们都能根据工作需要按时得到口罩、手套、工作服等防护用具。对于在有害健康部门工作的工人，企业行政免费供给牛奶，鸡蛋等健康食品。    （未完）
