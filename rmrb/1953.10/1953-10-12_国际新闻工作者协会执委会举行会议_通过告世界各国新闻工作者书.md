Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 11th: According to TASS, the Executive Committee of the International Organization of Journalists held a meeting in Prague from October 7th to 9th. Representatives of journalists from twelve countries participated in the meeting. The meeting heard reports on the work of the Executive Committee Secretariat and on the activities of the International Organization of Journalists.

    Those who spoke during the discussion included Erman (France), Simonov (Soviet Union), Liu Zunqi (China), Nguyen Thanh Le (Democratic Republic of Vietnam), Vilev (Bulgaria), Musale (Albania), and representatives from other countries. The speakers pointed out that the International Organization of Journalists had not done much to strengthen cooperation among journalists of various countries in the past two years, and had not provided sufficient support for the struggle of journalists in capitalist countries to improve their material conditions and working conditions.

    The meeting passed a resolution to strengthen the activities of the International Organization of Journalists. It was decided to hold the Fourth Congress of the International Organization of Journalists in the first half of 1954. It was also decided to publish the monthly magazine "Democratic Journalist" in five languages: Russian, English, French, German, and Spanish. In order to assist progressive journalists who are persecuted and suppressed for engaging in activities conducive to peace and international cooperation, it was decided to allocate funds from the membership fees paid by journalists' organizations and individual journalists from various countries to establish a mutual aid fund for solidarity.

    The meeting elected Czechoslovak journalist Jaroslav Knoblok as Secretary-General of the International Organization of Journalists. The Deputy Secretary-General will be represented by journalists' organizations from the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

    The meeting passed a letter to journalists of all countries. It pointed out that under the current international situation, journalists bear particularly important responsibilities. Their task is to support the people's best aspirations to live in peace, freedom, democracy, and national independence. Journalists must demand a peaceful solution to international disputes and strengthen economic and cultural ties between countries. To this end, journalists must conduct truthful, accurate, objective, and fair reporting, regardless of the different social systems of countries, based on respect for the peaceful and creative endeavors of the people. The International Organization of Journalists calls on journalists from all countries to cooperate in realizing these lofty principles in their professional activities. In order to promote truthful reporting on the lives of countries and their peoples, and to understand the lives and professional activities of journalists in various countries, mutual visits should be initiated. The International Organization of Journalists calls on journalists around the world to take resolute collective measures to protest against the persecution of journalists for making truthful reports that help maintain peace and ease international tensions. All journalists who strive to provide truthful and objective reporting should receive the support of their fellow journalists and the International Organization of Journalists.

    国际新闻工作者协会执委会举行会议
    通过告世界各国新闻工作者书
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社布拉格讯：国际新闻工作者协会执行委员会于十月七日到九日在布拉格举行会议。参加会议的有十二个国家的新闻工作者的代表。会议听取了关于执行委员会书记处工作的报告和国际新闻工作者协会活动的报告。
    在讨论中发言的有埃尔曼（法国）、西蒙诺夫（苏联）、刘尊棋（中国）、阮成理（越南民主共和国）、维列夫（保加利亚）、穆萨莱（阿尔巴尼亚）和其他国家的代表。发言的人指出，国际新闻工作者协会最近两年以来对于加强各国记者之间的合作所做事情不多，也没有对资本主义国家记者争取改善物质状况和工作条件的斗争给以足够的支持。
    会议通过加强国际新闻工作者协会的活动的决定。决定在一九五四年上半年举行国际新闻工作者协会第四次代表大会。还决定用俄、英、法、德、西班牙五种文字出版“民主记者”月刊。为了援助因从事有利于和平及国际合作的活动而遭到迫害和镇压的进步记者，决定从各国记者组织及个别记者交纳的会费中，拨款设立团结互助基金。
    会议选举捷克斯洛伐克记者雅罗斯拉夫·克诺布洛赫为国际新闻工作者协会总书记。副总书记将由苏联和中华人民共和国的记者组织的代表担任。
    会议通过了告世界各国新闻工作者书。其中指出：在目前的国际形势之下，新闻工作者所负的责任特别重大。他们的任务就是支持人民要求在和平、自由、民主与民族独立的条件下生活的最美好的愿望。新闻工作者必须要求和平解决国际争端，要求加强各国间经济与文化联系。为此，新闻工作者必须不问各国社会制度的不同，在尊重人民和平的创造性的努力的基础上，进行真实、正确、客观和公正的报道。国际新闻工作者协会要求各国新闻工作者为了在他们的职业活动中实现这些崇高的原则而进行合作。为了促进对各国与各国人民的生活作真实的报道，为了了解各国新闻工作者的生活与职业活动，应发起相互访问。国际新闻工作者协会要求全世界新闻工作者采取坚决的集体措施，对新闻工作者因作了有助于保持和平与缓和国际紧张局势的真实报道而遭到迫害提出抗议。凡是尽力提供真实的、客观的报道的新闻工作者，都应得到新闻同业和国际新闻工作者协会的支持。
