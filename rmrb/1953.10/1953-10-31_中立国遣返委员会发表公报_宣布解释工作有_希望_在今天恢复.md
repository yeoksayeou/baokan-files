Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 30th. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission issued a communiqué on the 30th stating that the explanation work for the Korean People's Army prisoners of war in the South Camp has a "hope" of resuming on the 31st after being interrupted for eleven days.

The long-term interruption of the explanation work was caused by American special agents who forcibly prevented the prisoners of war from leaving the camp to listen to the explanations. Shortly after the explanation work was interrupted, the Associated Press sent a telegram from New York on October 20th stating that even diplomatic circles in the United Nations were saying, "If the American troops stationed in Korea said a word, they could make them come out to listen to the Communist explanations." This clearly shows who is directing the special agents to sabotage the explanation work.

Obviously, if the Syngman Rhee special agents really let the prisoners of war come out to listen to the explanations tomorrow, it must be because they have received instructions from their American masters, and they must be prepared with new tricks to sabotage the explanation work. During this long period of delay, the Syngman Rhee special agents have obviously used terror to strengthen their control over the prisoners of war, making them even more afraid to express their desire for repatriation.

### 中立国遣返委员会发表公报  宣布解释工作有“希望”在今天恢复

    中立国遣返委员会发表公报
    宣布解释工作有“希望”在今天恢复
    【新华社开城三十日电】中立国遣返委员会三十日发表公报说，对南营的朝鲜人民军战俘进行的解释工作，在中断了十一天以后，有“希望”在三十一日恢复。
    解释工作的长期中断，是美方特务所造成的，他们强制地阻止战俘走出营场来听解释。在解释工作中断后不久，美联社在十月二十日从纽约发出一则电讯说，甚至联合国中的外交界人士也说，“如果驻朝鲜的美军说一句话，就可以使他们出来听共产党的解释。”这就很好地说明了特务分子破坏解释工作是由谁来指使的。
    很显然，如果李承晚特务明天真是让战俘出来听解释，那一定是他们已得到了他们美国主子的话，他们一定已准备好破坏解释工作的新花样。而在这一段长期拖延的期间，李承晚特务显然已使用恐怖手段，加强了他们对战俘的控制，使战俘更加不敢表示遣返的愿望。
