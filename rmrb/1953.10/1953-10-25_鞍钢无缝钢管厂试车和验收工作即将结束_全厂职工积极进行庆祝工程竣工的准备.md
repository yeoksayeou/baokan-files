    Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Plant Trial Run and Acceptance Work Nearing Completion
    All Factory Workers Actively Preparing to Celebrate the Project's Completion
    The trial run and acceptance work of the newly built seamless steel tube plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is nearing completion.

    Following the transfer of the rolling mill and its auxiliary equipment to the production department, in the past few days, two sizing machines and a piercing mill, along with their auxiliary equipment, have also undergone repeated trial runs and adjustments, and have successively completed "technical completion" acceptance signatures. At this point, only the sizing machine and reducing machine of the entire plant have not yet undergone "technical completion" acceptance. The sizing machine has been basically adjusted during trial operation and is about to undergo acceptance signature. The trial run and adjustment of the reducing machine are also proceeding smoothly. After it is properly adjusted, all the machines in the plant can be started simultaneously for no-load operation in preparation for hot test rolling.

    When the seamless steel tube plant is completed, a grand celebration and completion signing ceremony will be held. At present, the preparatory committee for the completion celebration meeting has been established. Many people in the factory are carrying out various preparatory work like they are handling a happy event. A large number of good news letters are being printed, and when completed, the workers will take these letters on floats to report the good news to the people of the city. Near the factory, the workers are arranging the venue for the celebration meeting. Female workers are also making various flowers, preparing to celebrate the completion of the seamless steel tube plant and their transformation from rural girls into workers in a modern factory. In the offices of the factory's trade union and the Communist Youth League, many people are busy drawing cartoons of the completion and pasting huge colorful slogans. At the same time, they are raising hundreds of colorful flags, preparing to dress up the venue and the new factory in grand attire upon completion.

    In preparing for the completion celebration activities, the workers feel unable to express their heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet experts. Therefore, they are asking people to rush-embroider a silk banner with the inscription "Sino-Soviet Friendship," preparing to present it to the Soviet experts at the celebration meeting. Many workers are enthusiastically writing letters of thanks to the Soviet experts amidst their busy schedules; workers and translators who understand Russian are also translating these letters into Russian.

    The artistic troupes participating in the Anshan city music and dance performance are selecting the most outstanding programs for the completion celebration meeting. Photographers from the Beijing Film Studio are also taking photos of the model workers who built the plant. The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and mass organizations such as the Anshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Communist Youth League are rushing to make a silk banner for the people who built the seamless steel tube plant. The banner reads: "Congratulations on your victorious completion of the glorious task of building the seamless steel tube plant. Make persistent efforts to welcome the new construction tasks of the country and strive to complete our country's first five-year construction plan." (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    鞍钢无缝钢管厂试车和验收工作即将结束
    全厂职工积极进行庆祝工程竣工的准备
    鞍山钢铁公司新建无缝钢管厂的试车和验收工作已近尾声。
    继轧管机及其附属设备移交给生产部门以后，在最近几天内，又有两部整径机和穿孔机及其附属设备，经过反复的试车和调整，已先后进行了“技术竣工”验收签字。至此，全厂只剩下定径机、减径机还没有进行“技术竣工”验收，其中的定径机在试运转中已基本上调整好，就要进行验收签字了。减径机的试车和调整也在顺利进行中，等它调整妥善以后，全厂所有机器就能同时开动，进行空运转，准备热试轧。
    无缝钢管厂竣工时，将要举行隆重的庆祝大会和竣工签字仪式。目前，庆祝竣工大会筹备委员会已经成立，工厂里的许多人员，正像办喜事一样地进行着各种筹备工作，大量的报喜信正在印制，竣工时职工们将拿着这些信乘着彩车向全市人民报喜。在工厂附近，职工们正在布置庆祝大会的会场。女工们也在扎制各种花朵，准备庆祝无缝钢管厂的竣工和自己由农村姑娘变成现代化工厂的工人。在工厂工会、青年团的办公室里，许多人正忙着画竣工的漫画，剪贴着巨幅的彩色标语。同时，他们又在筹集数百面彩旗，准备在竣工时给会场和新的工厂披上盛装。
    职工们在筹备庆祝竣工的活动中，都觉得无法表达他们对苏联专家衷心的感谢。因此他们正请人赶绣题词“中苏友谊”的锦旗，准备在庆祝大会上献给苏联专家。许多职工在百忙中热情地给苏联专家写致谢信；懂得俄文的职工和翻译们，还把这些信件译成俄文。
    正参加鞍山全市音乐舞蹈会演大会的文艺团体，已为庆祝竣工大会选定了最精彩的节目。从北京电影制片厂来的摄影师也在为建设该厂的劳动模范们拍摄照片。中共鞍山市委员会、鞍山钢铁公司和鞍山市工会、青年团等群众团体，正给建设无缝钢管厂的人们赶制一面锦旗。旗上写着：“庆祝你们胜利完成建设无缝钢管厂的光荣任务，再接再厉，迎接国家新的建设任务，为完成我国第一个五年建设计划而奋斗”。    （据新华社讯）
