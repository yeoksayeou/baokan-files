Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 25th: A grand rally was held in Pyongyang on the afternoon of the 24th with over 800 representatives from all circles to commemorate the third anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers entering Korea to fight.

    The attendees included: Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; Park Jung-ae and Kim Il, Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party; Choe Yong-gon, Vice Premier of the Cabinet and Minister of National Defense; Choe Chang-ik and Hong Myong-hui, Vice Premiers of the Cabinet; Li Young, representative of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland; Jung Yun-pyo, Chairman of the Pyongyang City People's Committee, and other party and government leaders; General Kim Kwang-hyup, Chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army; senior generals and combat heroes of the People's Army, representatives of various political parties and social organizations, and representatives from all walks of life in Pyongyang.

    Invited to participate were Gan Yetao, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Korea, and diplomatic envoys from the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries stationed in Korea.

    All members of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, headed by General Leader He Long, and the first sub-delegation, as well as the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers headed by General Li Da, Chief of Staff of the Volunteers, were invited to attend the conference.

    The conference began with the national anthems of China and Korea, followed by female soldiers of the Korean People's Army presenting flowers to the leaders of the delegation and the Volunteer delegation.

    General Kim Kwang-hyup, Chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army, delivered a report at the meeting. He first expressed his warm gratitude to all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers and heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and its great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong. He said: The power of the united Korean and Chinese peoples is indestructible by any aggressive forces in the world. He said: Now, the American aggressors are unwilling to accept defeat and are still frantically plotting war. Therefore, we, the Korean People's Army, must respond to the call of Marshal Kim Il-sung, continuously improve our combat effectiveness, actively participate in the post-war recovery and construction of the people's economy, and further strengthen our combat friendship with the Chinese People's Volunteers, consolidate our friendship and unity with the people of the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries, and strive for the peaceful reunification of the Fatherland.

    Li Young, representative of the Korean Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, then spoke. He said: The Korean people are determined to repay the assistance of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteers with actions that victoriously complete the task of recovery and construction.

    Park Kwang-hee, Vice Chairman of the Pyongyang City People's Committee, presented a flag to the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers on behalf of all the working people of Pyongyang, which was received by General Li Da.

    General Li Da spoke at the meeting. He said: After the Korean armistice was realized, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies abided by the terms of the armistice agreement and worked hard to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, American imperialism has continuously violated the terms of the armistice agreement, deliberately delayed and sabotaged the explanation work for prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated, obstructed the convening of political conferences, and attempted to station troops in Korea for a long time. Therefore, all comrades of our Chinese People's Volunteers will continue to adhere to the glorious struggle and strive to fight to the end for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. We also guarantee to do our best to help the Korean people carry out the work of recovery and construction.

    Zhang Bojun, Deputy General Leader of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, also spoke at the meeting. He first expressed warm congratulations and condolences to the heroic Korean people and the Korean and Chinese People's forces on behalf of the Chinese people. Zhang Bojun, Deputy General Leader, said: Today's festival marks the great victory of the Korean and Chinese people and the Korean and Chinese People's forces, and it also marks the shameful defeat of the American imperialist aggressors. He said: The Chinese people will unswervingly strengthen the unity and friendship between the Korean and Chinese people.

    The conference ended with the national anthems of China and Korea. After the meeting, the Korean People's Army Ensemble and the Choi Seung-hee Dance Research Institute and the Cultural Troupe of the Delegation performed wonderful programs.
