    Before the mid-season rice harvest, the Jian'ou County Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of working group cadres from three key townships, focusing on how to reduce the loss of rice grains during the harvesting process. Everyone believed this was an important task to increase grain yield and raise farmers' incomes.

    According to the investigation by the working group cadres, the losses caused from the rice harvest to the storage of grain are substantial in the local area.

    1. Losses caused during rice harvesting:

    1.  Solely pursuing speed, using excessive force, leaving rice stalks more than a foot long, and missing the reaping of broken and lodged rice ears. Furthermore, the masses do not have the habit of picking up fallen rice ears, so the missed rice ears are either eaten by birds or rot in the fields. Estimated from inspections in various places, an average of more than 50 grains of rice are lost per rice plant, resulting in a significant loss per mu.

    2.  For lush and lodged rice, the rice ears between plants are often intertwined. Pulling and shaking them haphazardly during harvesting causes many grains to fall off.

    3.  About half of the county has the habit of rushing to harvest rice at night, relying only on weak moonlight. Due to poor visibility during harvesting, coupled with the pursuit of speed, many grains are lost due to carelessness.

    4.  When transporting the harvested rice to the threshing floor (a tool for threshing), the rice bundles are often tied too large, causing grains to fall off. In some cases, children transport the rice, dragging it along the ground, resulting in significant losses.

    2. Losses caused during threshing:

    1.  Some areas thresh rice in the fields, threshing immediately after harvesting, moving the threshing floor to wherever the rice is cut. Grains flying out of the threshing floor cannot be picked up. According to farmers in Xin Village, at least five jin of rice are scattered outside the threshing floor for every hundred jin of rice threshed.

    2.  During threshing, there is only one strike up and one strike down, rarely shaking the rice again after the first strike, resulting in even more grains being left outside the threshing floor.

    3.  Some people focus solely on speed, only striking the rice bundle five times, often leaving many grains on the rice stalks. According to experiments conducted by farmers in Dikou Township, striking eight times instead of five can yield eighty to ninety more grains per rice bundle.

    3. Losses caused during sun-drying:

    1.  Grains are eaten by birds due to lack of supervision.

    2.  Farmers carelessly rake the rice, often raking the grains inside the bamboo mat onto the ground, making it impossible to sweep some of the grains back.

    3.  Each mat of rice needs to be raked three times. When farmers walk off the bamboo mat after raking, the grains sticking to the soles of their shoes also fall off.

    Adding up the grain losses in the above three processes of harvesting, threshing, and sun-drying, at least ten jin of grain are lost for every hundred jin of rice harvested. Of course, not all harvesting operations in the county are this crude, but this loss is significant.

    This type of loss is not unavoidable or impossible to reduce. For example, half of the county does not harvest rice at night. Farmers in some areas already have the habit of laying straw around the threshing floor. With straw laid down, the grains scattered around the threshing floor fall on the straw, preventing them from sticking to the wet soil and making them easier to collect. The problem is that most farmers, especially young farmers, do not attach enough importance to this issue. Therefore, to reduce grain losses during the harvesting process, the first step is to strengthen propaganda work and correct some erroneous ideas of cadres and the masses, such as "Some grains will always fall when eating, and some grains will inevitably be lost when harvesting," and "After three years of continuous bumper harvests, losing some grain doesn't matter," and so on. When conducting propaganda and education on increasing production and practicing economy among farmers, detailed accounting should be used to illustrate the severity of the losses and waste caused during harvesting, and to explain that saving grain increases income for farmers and also increases the state's ability to adjust and supply grain. Local experienced farmers should be invited to study methods for preventing the loss of rice grains, and typical examples should be used to organize the masses to observe on-site to educate the masses, so that they will voluntarily and actively improve harvesting methods and increase yields.

    Under normal autumn harvest conditions, one should prevent one-sided emphasis on "fast harvesting, fast threshing," and instead emphasize "harvesting well, threshing well, drying well, and storing well." In particular, competitions focused on "fast harvesting, fast threshing" within mutual aid teams should be prevented to reduce losses.

    In general, the following points should be noted during the rice harvesting process:

    1.  When harvesting rice, the movements should be steady, the rice stalks should be left shorter, and there should be no random shaking or pulling during cutting. In areas where it is customary to harvest rice at night, farmers should be patiently educated to change to harvesting during the day, and the old habit should be gradually changed on the basis of their self-awareness; if necessary, children can be organized to go to the fields to pick up missed rice ears.

    2.  The rice should not be bundled too large; if children are transporting it, they should be told to carry the rice ears on their shoulders and not drag them on the ground.

    3.  The threshing floor should be fixed in a relatively dry place and should not be moved around. It is best to lay straw around the threshing floor. When threshing, the movements should be steady and accurate, and the number of strikes per rice bundle should be increased from five or six to seven or eight. After threshing, the grains around the threshing floor should be collected.

    4.  Localities can organize children to watch over the rice when sun-drying; farmers should be careful when raking the rice; and the grains sticking to the soles of their shoes should be cleaned off before leaving.

    从福建省建瓯县三个乡的调查看改进收割方法的重要性
    李公宜　谢宝珠　叶辉  梁枫　翁联辉
    中共建瓯县委在中稻收割前，召开三个基点乡的工作组干部会议，着重研究了如何减少收割过程中稻子抛撒损失的问题。大家认为这是提高粮食收获量使农民增加收入的一项重要工作。
    根据工作组干部的调查，当地从收割稻子到谷子进仓的过程中所造成的损失是很大的。
    一、收割稻子时造成的损失
    一、单纯求快，出手太重，留下的稻秆，竟有一尺多长，折断和倒伏的稻穗就漏割了。群众又没有拾稻穗的习惯，因而漏割的稻穗，不是被鸟啄食，就是在田里霉烂掉。从各地方的检查来估计，一般每丛稻禾要丢失谷子五十多粒，每亩损失的数目就很大。
    二、茂盛和倒伏的稻子，株与株间的稻穗，往往相互扭结，收割时乱拉乱抖，不少谷子就脱落了。
    三、全县约有二分之一的地区有夜晚抢割稻子的习惯，只靠微弱的月光，收割时看不清楚，加上抢割时单纯求快，草率从事，丢失了很多谷粒。
    四、把割下的稻谷送到“打谷楻”（脱粒用的工具）附近时，往往因稻子捆得过大，谷粒被抖落；有的由小孩子送稻谷，挨地拖落，损失也不少。
    二、打稻子时造成的损失
    一、有些地区在田间打稻谷，随收随打，谷子割到那里，“打谷楻”就移到那里；飞出“打谷楻”的谷子，无法拾起来。根据新村乡农民反映：一般打一百斤谷子，撒在“打谷楻”外边的至少有五斤谷子。
    二、打谷时一上一下，很少在打了一下后再抖一抖，丢在“打谷楻”外边的谷子就更多。
    三、有些人单纯求快，一把稻禾只打五下，稻秆上往往还留着不少谷粒。根据迪口乡农民曾经作过的试验，打八下比打五下，每把稻禾可以多打八、九十粒谷子。
    三、晒谷时造成的损失
    一、无人看管，谷子被鸟啄食。
    二、农民翻耙谷子不小心，往往把竹席内的谷子耙到地上去，有些谷子便扫不回来。
    三、每席谷子要翻耙三次，农民翻耙后走出竹席时，粘带在鞋底上的谷子，也丢落了。
    把上述收割、打稻和晒谷三个过程中所损失的谷粒加起来计算，每收一百斤谷子至少要损失十斤。自然并不是全县在收割操作中都是这样粗糙，但是这一笔损失是很大的。
    这种损失并不是不能避免或减少的。如：全县有一半地区，就不是在夜间收割稻子的。部分地区农民已有在“打谷楻”周围铺稻草的习惯；铺了稻草，撒在“打谷楻”四周的谷子就落在稻草上，不致粘在湿的田土里，便于收拾。问题在于大部分农民、特别是青年农民对于这个问题还不够重视。因此，要减少粮食在收获过程中的损失，首先要加强宣传工作，纠正干部和群众的某些错误思想，如认为“吃饭还会掉饭粒，收谷子不能不掉粒”、“三年连续丰收，丢一些谷子没有什么关系”等等。向农民进行增产节约的宣传教育时，要通过算细账，说明收割中造成损失浪费的严重程度，说明节约粮食对农民来说是增加了收入，对国家来说也可以增加调剂供应粮食的力量。要邀集当地老农民研究防止稻谷抛撒损失的办法，通过典型事例，组织群众实地观摩来教育群众，使他们自愿地、积极地改进收割方法，提高收获量。
    在正常秋收的情况下，应防止片面强调“快收、快打”，而要强调“收好、打好、晒好、藏好”。特别要防止互助组中进行以“快收、快打”为主要内容的竞赛，以减少损失。
    一般地区在收割稻子的过程中，要注意以下几点：
    一、收割稻子时，出手要稳，稻秆要留得短一些，割时不要乱抖乱扯。习惯在夜间收割稻子的地区，应耐心教育农民改在白天割稻，并在其自觉的基础上，逐步改变旧习惯；必要时可以组织儿童下田拾漏割的稻穗。
    二、稻子不要捆得太大；如果是小孩搬运，要告诉他们要把稻穗背在肩上，不要满地拖。
    三、“打谷楻”应固定在一个较干燥的地方，不要搬东移西。“打谷楻”的周围，最好用稻草铺垫。打谷时要打得稳、打得准，每把稻穗应由打五、六下增至七、八下。打完后，将“打谷楻”周围的谷子收拾起来。
    四、各地在晒谷时，可组织儿童看管；农民翻耙谷子时，要小心；临走时要把粘在鞋底上的谷子拍干净。
