The entire staff of the state-owned Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant launched a production competition in September to comprehensively fulfill the state plan. From mid-September, the plant's workers proposed a friendly competition to the Shanghai Turbine Factory, with the conditions of guaranteeing the completion of the third quarter's tasks and improving product quality to 99 percent. In the past two weeks, great achievements have been made. For example, the single-piece pass rate of the stator section workers in the heavy motor workshop has reached 100 percent for ten consecutive days. The coil section completed all the third quarter's production tasks on September 25th. During the competition, engineers Fang Fulin, Mei Xianhao, and Wang Ming went to the workshop to cooperate with the workers in repairing a pipe bending machine, which enabled the completion of bending 1,400 steel pipes, which originally required three months of manual work, in just thirteen working days, ensuring the on-schedule completion of the plant's newly produced 15,000 kVA transformer on September 26th. They also researched and added a condenser to the vacuum chamber in the transformer drying room to strengthen the drying capacity of the drying room. This solved the problem of reduced transformer insulation affecting quality, which had not been completely resolved for a long time. This small factory, which had fewer than 200 workers before liberation and could only manufacture 10-horsepower motors, has produced 362 different specifications of generators, electric motors, and transformers in the past four years. These include 15,000 kVA giant transformers and 6,000 kW steam turbine generators, which have strongly supported construction throughout the country. In 1952, they completed the annual plan with a surplus of 9.15 percent, and in the first half of this year, they continuously completed the state plan. Now, they are actively responding to the call of the higher authorities to increase production and practice economy, and have set a goal of increasing production and saving 17 billion yuan on the basis of completing the state plan. This plan has been enthusiastically supported by all the plant's employees. Many workers in various workshops and sections have proposed specific measures to ensure the victorious completion of the production increase and economy plan. The rotor section of the heavy motor workshop, through "detailed accounting," improving ideological understanding, and improving working methods, can shorten more than 16,000 hours according to work quotas in the fourth quarter's production, which is equivalent to more than 20 days of work for the section. The rotor shaft team of the light motor workshop alone can shorten more than 2,290 working hours. (Ai Fang)

    上海电机厂开展生产竞赛获成绩
    国营上海电机厂的全体职工在九月间，展开了为全面完成国家计划的生产竞赛。九月中旬起，该厂工人以保证完成第三季度任务和提高产品质量到百分之九十九的条件，向上海汽轮机厂提出了友谊竞赛。两个星期以来，获得了很大的成就。如该厂重电机车间定子工段的工人连续十天的单件合格率都达到了百分之百。线圈工段九月二十五日就完成了第三季度全部生产任务。在竞赛中，工程人员方福林、梅贤豪及王明等下车间协同工人修造了一部弯管机，使原来用人工需要三个月才能完成的一千四百根钢管的弯管工作，仅仅十三个工作日就全部完成了，保证了该厂新出品一万五千千伏安的变压器，在九月二十六日按期完成。并研究在变压器烘房内的真空箱上增设了一部冷凝器，加强了烘房干燥能力，这样，使长期未能彻底解决的变压器绝缘下降影响品质的问题，得到了解决。这个在解放前不满两百工人、仅仅能制造十匹马力马达的小厂子，四年来它已生产出三百六十二种不同规格的发电机、电动机、变压器。其中包括一万五千千伏安巨型变压器和六千瓩的汽轮发电机，这些产品有力地支援了全国各地的建设。一九五二年他们曾以超额百分之九点一五的成绩完成了全年计划，今年上半年又连续完成了国家计划。现在他们又积极响应上级增产节约号召，在完成国家计划基础上，订出增产节约一百七十亿元的奋斗目标。这个计划已得到全厂职工热烈拥护。各车间、工段很多工人已提出了具体办法，以保证增产节约计划胜利完成。重电机车间转子工段通过“算细账”，提高思想认识，改进工作方法，在第四季度生产中按工时定额可以缩短一万六千多小时，等于该工段多作二十多天的工作。轻电机车间转轴班一个班就可以缩短二千二百九十多个工时。（艾方）
