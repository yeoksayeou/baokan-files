TASS reported from Moscow on the 17th: The Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union recently held its Thirteenth Plenary Session. The meeting discussed the resolutions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on measures for the further development of agriculture and the tasks of the Young Communist League in realizing these resolutions, as well as the issue of convening the Twelfth Congress of the Young Communist League.

    The plenary session believes that ensuring the active participation of Young Communist League members and all Soviet youth in the work of realizing the great plan for the further development of Soviet agriculture formulated by the CPSU Central Committee's plenary session is the most important task of the Young Communist League organizations. The Young Communist League should conduct extensive propaganda work to publicize the resolutions of the CPSU Central Committee's plenary session to Young Communist League members and all Soviet youth, as well as the resolutions of the Soviet Council of Ministers and the CPSU Central Committee on developing animal husbandry, increasing the production of potatoes and vegetables, and improving machine tractor stations.

The plenary session demanded that Young Communist League organizations at all levels make every effort to improve political work among young people and strive to raise the educational level of the masses. The resolution of the meeting pointed out that, in the current situation, every Young Communist League worker must be familiar with agricultural production and the work of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms. Young Communist League workers should study the basic knowledge and advanced experience of agricultural science and make every effort to promote this experience to agriculture. The plenary session also assured the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that Young Communist League members and all Soviet youth will demonstrate their creativity and initiative and spare no effort or labor in the struggle to complete the further development of Soviet agriculture and continuously improve the welfare of the Soviet people.

    The plenary session has passed a resolution to convene the Twelfth Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League in February 1954. The agenda of the congress is as follows: the summary report of the Central Committee of the Young Communist League; the summary report of the Central Auditing Commission of the Young Communist League; a report on the work of the Leninist Young Pioneers organization; revision of the League's Constitution; election of the central organs of the Young Communist League.
