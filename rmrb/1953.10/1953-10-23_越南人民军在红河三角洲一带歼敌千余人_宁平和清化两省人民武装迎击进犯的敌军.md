Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: According to Vietnam News Agency, the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army announced on the 20th that, according to preliminary statistics, the Vietnamese People's Army and guerrillas annihilated 1,200 enemy troops in the Red River Delta area of North Vietnam in the first ten days of October, including one major and many French military officers; sank and destroyed one large enemy gunboat and fifteen motorcycles; and captured a large number of enemy weapons and ammunition, including more than 200 machine guns.

The communiqué stated: After victoriously repulsing the large-scale "mopping-up operation" launched by the enemy north of Luc Giang, the Vietnamese People's Army in Xing'an and Haiyang provinces on the left bank of the Red River continued to closely cooperate with local guerrillas, using various combat methods to annihilate the enemy's active forces. In the ten days up to October 10th, they launched a total of eleven annihilation attacks, each time wiping out more than a platoon of enemy troops. On October 1st and 2nd, guerrillas destroyed seven enemy trucks in Fu Ju and Xian Lu counties in Xing'an province. On October 4th, the People's Army launched a surprise attack on the enemy in Qing Mian County, Haiyang Province, annihilating 87 enemy troops; and annihilated 130 enemy troops belonging to the 707th Light Infantry Battalion of the puppet army in Mi Shi, north of the Xing'an provincial capital. On October 5th, the People's Army annihilated 100 enemy troops in the anti-"mopping-up operation" in Gu Li, northeast of the Xing'an provincial capital. On October 6th, the People's Army sank a large enemy gunboat on the Luc Giang River, and on October 9th, it annihilated a company of enemy paratroopers in Tian Lu County, Xing'an Province. On October 5th and 10th, the People's Army also destroyed two enemy strongholds in Xing'an Province, He She and Fu Zao, each guarded by about a company of troops.

In the area on the right bank of the Red River, after the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated more than ten companies of puppet troops in the southern part of Nan Ding Province at the end of September, the enemy mobilized more mobile troops to "mop up" the area, attempting to preserve their puppet army light infantry battalions. However, they were intercepted by local People's Army units and guerrillas in many places, suffering heavy casualties. For example, in Da Tong and Jiao Shui counties in Nan Ding Province, the People's Army routed a puppet army light infantry battalion on October 6th, annihilating 340 enemy troops and capturing a total of 149 enemy machine guns and rifles.

Xinhua News Agency, October 21st: According to Vietnam News Agency on the 21st, the French army launched offensives in Ninh Binh and Thanh Hoa provinces last week, and were met with resistance from the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces.

On the morning of October 15th, a force of enemy troops advanced westward along Highway 59 from northern Ninh Binh Province towards the Phu Nho Quan liberated area. On the evening of the 17th, the enemy reached Ly A, 12 kilometers from the county seat of Phu Nho Quan. Along the way, they were attacked by Vietnamese guerrillas, and a platoon was annihilated.

On the same day, another French army force set out from Hoang Dan, another stronghold in northern Ninh Binh, and advanced westward. Vietnamese guerrillas intercepted the enemy at Lang Van, five kilometers from Hoang Dan, killing and wounding 53 enemy troops.

At 7:00 AM on the morning of the 16th, 400 enemy troops landed by motorboat in the villages of Ba Lang and Do Xuyen in southern Thanh Hoa Province. The enemy was again attacked by local guerrillas here, and hastily withdrew that evening.

In order to cooperate with the people's armed forces of Ninh Binh and Thanh Hoa provinces in repelling the invading enemy troops, the People's Army stepped up attacks in Bui Chu and Thai Binh on the evenings of the 15th and 16th, causing the enemy to suffer serious losses.

    越南人民军在红河三角洲一带歼敌千余人
    宁平和清化两省人民武装迎击进犯的敌军
    【新华社二十二日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总司令部在二十日发表公报说：据初步统计，越南人民军和游击队在十月的头十天中在北越红河三角洲一带歼灭敌军一千二百名，其中有一名少校和许多法军军官；击沉和击毁敌军大型炮艇一艘和摩托车十五辆；缴获敌军大批武器、弹药，其中有机枪二百多挺。
    公报说：红河左岸地区的兴安和海阳两省的越南人民军，在胜利反击了敌军在禄江以北发动的大规模“扫荡战”以后，继续和当地游击队密切配合，用各种战斗方式来歼灭敌军的有生力量。在到十月十日为止的十天内，他们一共发动了十一次歼灭性的袭击，每次袭击都歼灭敌军一排多人。十月一、二两日，游击队在兴安省府巨县和先旅县击毁敌军卡车七辆。十月四日，人民军向海阳省清冕县的敌军发动一次突击，歼灭敌军八十七名；并在兴安省省会以北的米市歼灭属于伪军第七百零七轻装营的敌军一百三十名。十月五日，人民军在兴安省省会东北固丽进行的反“扫荡战”中，歼灭敌军一百名。十月六日，人民军击沉了禄江上的一艘敌军大型炮艇，在十月九日，又歼灭在兴安省天旅县的一连敌军伞兵。十月五日和十日，人民军又在兴安省摧毁每个据点都有一连人左右守卫着的两个敌军据点——河舍、富早。
    在红河右岸地区，越南人民军九月底在南定省南部歼灭伪军十连多人以后，敌军又纠集更多的机动部队来“扫荡”这个地区，企图保存他们的伪军轻装营。但是，在许多地方都遭到人民军地方部队和游击队的截击，伤亡很大。例如，在南定省大同县和交水县，人民军在十月六日击溃了一个伪军轻装营，歼灭敌军三百四十名，缴获敌军机枪和步枪共一百四十九挺（支）。
    【新华社二十二日讯】据越南通讯社二十一日讯：法军上周在宁平省和清化省发动攻势，遭到越南人民武装的迎击。
    十月十五日晨，一支敌军从宁平省北部沿第五十九号公路往西向府儒关解放区进犯。十七日晚间，敌军到达距府儒关县城十二公里处的里亚。途中遭到越南游击队的袭击，被歼一个排。
    同一天，又有一支法军从宁平北部的另一据点黄檀出发，向西进犯。越南游击队在距黄檀五公里的朗云地方截击敌军，杀伤敌军五十三人。
    十六日晨七时，敌军四百名乘汽艇在清化省南部的巴浪村和都川村登陆。敌人在这里又受到当地游击队的攻击，当天晚上就慌忙撤走。
    为了配合宁平和清化两省的人民武装对进犯敌军的迎击，人民军在十五日、十六日晚间加紧在裴朱和太平两地出击，使敌军遭受了严重的损失。
