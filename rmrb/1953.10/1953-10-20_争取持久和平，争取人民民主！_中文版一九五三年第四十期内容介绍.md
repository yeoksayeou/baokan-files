The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese edition, 1953, Issue 40, has been published.

The central theme of this issue is the celebration of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This issue publishes the full texts of the congratulatory telegrams sent by G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and V.M. Molotov, Minister of Foreign Affairs, to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government and Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai, respectively. It also publishes an article by Lin Boqu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, entitled "The Beginning of a New Period of Planned National Economic Construction." This issue also published an editorial entitled "The People's Republic of China Embarks on the Road of Development and Prosperity." The editorial pointed out that in the past four years, the People's Republic of China has shown the world its great vitality and solidity. The social system and state system of the people's democratic dictatorship and its foundation—the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class—have been firmly established in China. The prerequisites for the victorious implementation of the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy have been created domestically. The international prestige of the People's Republic of China has been greatly enhanced. The Chinese people are full of enthusiasm for building a happy new life and are advancing on the road of their noble cause. Communist and Workers' parties of all countries and all progressive mankind extend their heartfelt congratulations to the great Chinese people and the glorious Communist Party of China.

Important articles published in this issue include: "Struggle for National Unity, for the Freedom and Happiness of the German People" by Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and "An Inexhaustible Source of Inspiration" by Luigi Longo, Deputy General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party.

Wilhelm Pieck's article was written to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic (October 7). In his article, he first analyzed the reactionary essence of the West German parliamentary elections on September 6 and described the facts that the reactionary forces of West Germany and US imperialism colluded with each other to revive militarism. He then pointed out that the German Democratic Republic has become, to a greater extent, a bulwark in the struggle for a peaceful solution to the German question. It must fulfill its historical task and pave the way for the German people to a unified, democratic, independent, and peace-loving Germany. Lu Longo's article pointed out that the resolutions and documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, held last October, are an inexhaustible source of inspiration for all Communist and Workers' parties. The events that have taken place in the past year have fully confirmed the correctness of the analysis of the international situation and the resolutions adopted by the Congress. The article said: Facts show that the new rulers of Italy are still unable to get rid of foreign pressure. Therefore, the Italian Communists have more resolutely raised the banner of democratic freedom, which has been abandoned by the bourgeoisie, and are continuing to move forward under it.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版
    一九五三年第四十期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第四十期已经出版。
    本期的中心内容是：庆祝中华人民共和国成立四周年。本期刊载了苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫和外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫分别致我中央人民政府毛泽东主席和政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来的贺电全文；发表了中国共产党中央委员会政治局委员林伯渠的文章：“有计划的国民经济建设的新时期的开始”。本期并以“中华人民共和国走上发展和繁荣的道路”为题发表社论。社论指出：过去的四年，中华人民共和国向全世界表明了它的伟大的生命力和强固性。人民民主专政的社会制度和国家制度及其基础——以工人阶级为领导的工农联盟，已经在中国巩固地建立起来。国内已经创造了胜利执行发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的先决条件。中华人民共和国的国际威望已大大地提高了。中国人民充满建设幸福新生活的热情，在进行他们崇高事业的道路上前进。各国共产党和工人党及全体进步人类，都向伟大的中国人民和光荣的中国共产党致以衷心的祝贺。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：德意志民主共和国总统、德国统一社会党中央委员会主席威廉·皮克的“为全国统一、为德国人民的自由和幸福而奋斗”，意大利共产党副总书记路易吉·隆哥的“永不枯竭的鼓舞源泉”。
    威廉·皮克的文章是为纪念德意志民主共和国成立四周年（十月七日）而作的。他在文章中首先分析了九月六日西德议会选举的反动本质，叙述了西德反动势力和美帝国主义的相互勾结引起军国主义复活的事实。他接着指出：德意志民主共和国已经在更大程度上成为争取和平解决德国问题的斗争中的堡垒。它一定要完成它的历史任务，并为德国人民铺平走向统一、民主、独立和爱好和平的德国的道路。路·隆哥的文章指出：去年十月召开的苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的决议和文件，对所有共产党和工人党来说，是一个永不枯竭的鼓舞源泉。在过去一年中所发生的事件，完全证实了代表大会所作的关于国际形势的分析和所通过的决议的正确性。文章说：事实表明，意大利的新的统治者仍不能摆脱外国的压力。因此，意大利共产党人已经比以前更坚决地举起被资产阶级抛在一边的民主自由的旗帜，并正打着它继续前进。（新华社）
