Hangzhou Local State-Owned and Joint State-Private Factories
    Breaking the Mindset That Production Cannot Be Increased, Launching a Production Increase and Economy Drive Competition
    More than twenty local state-owned and joint state-private factories in Hangzhou, included in the state plan, have deeply mobilized the masses to formulate plans and launch a production increase and economy drive competition after breaking the erroneous idea held by some leading cadres that "local industry is a dilapidated business and production cannot be increased or economies achieved."
    The Hangzhou Iron Factory, which manufactures electric choppers for national industrial construction, has implemented operation plans and concentrated experienced workers to solve the long-standing problem of high scrap rates in the foundry. The entire factory can guarantee the overall over-fulfillment of this year's production plan and ensure that all products in the fourth quarter meet Grade A standards. The Hangzhou Cement Factory, which originally believed that the potential of its machines had been fully exploited and was unsure about completing the fourth quarter production plan, has resolved the problem of the clinker kiln not keeping up with the cement mill after mobilizing the masses to study the issue. As a result, it can not only guarantee the completion of the original plan, but also increase production by more than 400 tons of cement. The Hangzhou Power Plant has grasped the key issues of reducing coal consumption and reducing accidents, and can increase production and save 5.2 billion yuan for the state in the fourth quarter. Employees of the Zhejiang Pharmaceutical Factory have found the trick to increase unit output and reduce raw material consumption, and can increase production and save 1.3 billion yuan in the fourth quarter. The joint state-private Hangjiang Yarn Factory, which had not completed its quality plan for the past nine months, has been deeply mobilized to focus on solving key issues such as reducing yarn breakage rates, increasing unit output, and reducing raw cotton consumption by three jin per piece of cotton yarn. In addition to ensuring that all cotton yarn reaches Grade A standards in the fourth quarter, it can also increase production and save 940 million yuan. (Xinhua News Agency)

    杭州市地方国营、公私合营工厂
    打破无法增产思想开展增产节约竞赛
    杭州市二十多个列入国家计划的地方国营、公私合营工厂，打破部分领导干部认为“地方工业是破烂摊子，无法增产节约”的错误思想后，已深入发动群众订出计划，展开了增产节约竞赛。
    给国家工业建设制造电动铡床的杭州铁工厂，由于推行作业计划，集中有经验的职工解决了长期存在的铸工场废品多的问题，全厂可保证全面超额完成今年生产计划，并保证第四季度全部出品都达到甲级标准。原来认为机器潜力已经挖尽，第四季度生产计划无把握完成的杭州水泥厂，经过发动群众研究，解决了熟料窑跟不上水泥磨的问题后，不仅保证完成原订计划，还可增产四百多吨水泥。杭州电厂抓住降低煤耗和减少事故的关键问题，第四季度可以给国家增产节约五十二亿元。浙江制药厂职工找到了提高了单位产量降低了原材料消耗的窍门，第四季度可以增产节约十三亿元。过去九个月一直没有完成质量计划的公私合营杭江纱厂，经过深入动员，抓紧解决降低细纱断头率、提高单位产量、每件棉纱降低原棉三斤等关键问题，第四季度除保证全部棉纱都达到甲级标准外，还可增产节约九亿四千万元。（新华社）
