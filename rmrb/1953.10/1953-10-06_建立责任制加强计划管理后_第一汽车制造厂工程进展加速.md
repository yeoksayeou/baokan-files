After establishing a responsibility system and strengthening planning management, the construction progress of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has accelerated. To ensure project quality, the plant is stepping up the establishment of a quality responsibility system and launching a production increase and economization campaign centered on it.

The construction project of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant officially started in July this year, and five major factory buildings have been successively started. From mid-August, a campaign to establish a responsibility system was launched on the construction site, starting with the establishment of a planning responsibility system. After more than a month of work, a relatively sound system has been established in terms of compiling plans, implementing plans, and checking the implementation of plans. The result of "establishing and implementing simultaneously" has accelerated the progress of the project. By mid-September, an average of more than 50% of the annual plan for the five factory buildings had been completed. Among them, the forging workshop started later, but completed 7.76% of the annual plan in just eight days after construction began. The actual working days for the above five factory building projects, except for the carpentry workshop, were only about one-third of the planned construction period, while the project progress reached more than half of the annual planned workload. Looking at the completion of the September project plan, as of September 20, two of the five factory buildings (the mechanical assembly workshop and the auxiliary workshop) had completed more than two-thirds of the monthly plan, and the other two factory buildings (the carpentry workshop and the non-ferrous metal workshop) had completed more than four-fifths of the monthly plan. By this month, not only is there confidence in completing the monthly plan, but it is also possible to exceed the monthly plan.

In terms of project quality, due to the initial establishment of the idea of "quality first for a century-long plan" by the plant's leading cadres and most employees, no major quality accidents have occurred since the start of construction. For example, the reinforced concrete foundation project of the carpentry workshop, due to thorough preparation, strict compliance with technical operating procedures, and conscientious implementation of the suggestions of Soviet experts, only three of the 256 column foundation projects were unqualified due to uneven water-cement ratio caused by rainy weather during pouring. However, there are still phenomena of no one being responsible or not being responsible in the construction technical management. For example, in the concrete column foundation project of the auxiliary workshop, six column foundations have been found to have exposed steel bars and honeycomb pitting. The precast concrete roof panels of the processing plant also have the problem of low quality. For example, in the ten days from September 1st to 10th, 18% of the products were unqualified. To strengthen technical management and ensure project quality, the plant has decided to further establish a quality responsibility system on the basis of the planning responsibility system and launch a production increase and economization campaign centered on it. At present, the plant is inspecting and exposing the problems existing in project quality, and at the same time organizing mutual visits between construction sites to promote the experience of the carpentry workshop in ensuring project quality. All the employees of the plant are in high spirits and have actively launched a competition to strive for the comprehensive completion and over-completion of the 1953 construction plan.

### 建立责任制加强计划管理后  第一汽车制造厂工程进展加速

    建立责任制加强计划管理后
    第一汽车制造厂工程进展加速
    第一汽车制造厂建筑工地自建立责任制、加强计划管理以来，加速了工程进度。为保证工程质量，该厂正加紧建立质量责任制，并以此为中心开展增产节约竞赛。
    第一汽车制造厂建筑工程在今年七月正式开工，到现在已有五个主要厂房陆续开工修建。八月中旬起，工地里展开了建立责任制运动，首先建立了计划责任制。经过一个多月的工作，在编制计划、贯彻计划以及检查计划执行情况等方面都有了比较健全的制度。“一面建立、一面贯彻”的结果，加速了工程进度。到九月中旬为止，平均已完成了五个厂房全年计划的百分之五十以上。其中锻工场开工较晚，但仅在开工后的八天时间内，即完成了年计划的百分之七点七六。上述五个厂房工程的实际工作日数，除木工场外，均仅及计划工期的三分之一左右，而工程进度却达到了全年计划工程量的一半以上。就九月份工程计划的完成情况来看，到九月二十日为止，五个厂房中有两个厂房（机械装配场及辅助工场）已完成了全月计划的三分之二以上，另两个厂房（木工场及有色金属场）已完成全月计划的五分之四以上。到本月为止，不但有把握完成全月计划，而且尚可超额完成全月计划。
    在工程质量方面，由于该厂领导干部和大部职工初步树立了“百年大计，质量第一”的思想，自开工到现在尚未发生重大的质量事故。如木工场钢筋混凝土基础工程，由于充分作好准备工作，切实遵守了技术操作规程，并认真地贯彻了苏联专家的建议，在全部二百五十六个柱基工程中，仅有三个柱基由于因天雨浇灌发生了水灰比重不均的现象外，其余的柱基全部合格。但在施工技术管理上还存在着无人负责或不负责任的现象。如辅助工场的混凝土柱基工程，已发现了六个柱基有露钢筋及蜂窝麻面的现象。加工厂预制混凝土屋面板也存在着质量不高的毛病，如九月一日至十日的十天当中，即有百分之十八的产品质量不合格。为加强技术管理，保证工程质量，该厂已决定在计划责任制运动的基础上，进一步建立质量责任制，并以此为中心开展增产节约竞赛。目前该厂正在检查和揭发工程质量中所存在的问题，同时组织各工地互相参观，推广木工场保证工程质量的经验。该厂全体职工情绪很高，已积极展开竞赛，争取全面完成和超额完成一九五三年的施工计划。
