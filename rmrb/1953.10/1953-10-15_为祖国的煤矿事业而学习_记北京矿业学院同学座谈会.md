    Studying for the Motherland's Coal Mining Industry
    ——A Record of a Symposium with Students from the Beijing Mining Institute
    Yang Zhixiu  Ma Lanying  Xu Shifan
    A few days before the start of the semester, the Beijing Mining Institute (formerly the China Mining Institute) held a symposium. The participants included students from various departments and majors, and their speeches were enthusiastic. It was clear that the students already had deep feelings for coal. They called the black coal "black gold." Ma Lanying, a first-year student in the coal mining department, Class A, said: "When I see coal, I feel that it is a treasure of the motherland, my dearest friend. I will live with coal forever." She talked about what happiness is. She said: "What is my happiness? It is today's study and tomorrow's work. When I master advanced coal mining technology and transport carts of coal to all parts of the motherland, bringing happiness, warmth, and light to the people of the motherland, I feel that this is the happiness of us coal mining workers."
    For many students, this love for the coal mining industry existed even before entering the China Mining Institute. He Yanan, a first-year student in the coal mining department, decided to study coal mining while in high school. At that time, like all progressive students, she often cared about the development of the motherland's construction in all aspects. The National Coal Mine Production Exhibition held at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace in April and May 1951 gave her a profound education. The charts and models at the exhibition showed her that our country has extremely rich mineral deposits. Our ancestors discovered coal in the Han Dynasty, but did not know how to mine it. Since the forces of imperialism invaded China, our country's mines have always been their objects of plunder; during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan alone, Japanese imperialism plundered nearly 400 million tons of coal from China. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang reactionaries ignored coal mine production and the lives of miners, and many coal mines were destroyed. However, after liberation, from 1949 to 1951, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, many mines were repaired, and production efficiency was greatly improved. What particularly excited her was that the production record of a pneumatic drill operator at that time had exceeded the level of the first new record created by the Soviet Stakhanov. But the chart also showed that at that time, our country's annual coal production was still far behind that of the Soviet Union. She did not understand why our coal production was so low, so she asked the guide. The guide was a student at the Beijing Mining Institute. He said: "In addition to the reasons such as the destruction of mines by imperialism and reactionaries, one of the reasons is that in the past, many young people thought that studying coal mining was 'unlucky' and did not want to study coal mining."
    After returning from the visit, the impression of the exhibition and the voice of the guide lingered in her mind for a long time. From then on, she deeply fell in love with the coal mining industry. After graduating from high school, she applied to the Beijing Mining Institute.
    Wang Zhenduo, a second-year student in the coal mining department, filled all five of his college application choices with "mining department." He loves geography, and since high school, he has had the ideal of developing the rich underground treasures of the great motherland. But when he first arrived at the Beijing Mining Institute, he heard some students talk about how hard coal mining work is, and how there is a risk of life due to gas explosions, which frightened him. He thought: Coal mining is simply risking your life. For a while, he was listless in his studies. But soon he understood that it was a product of a certain social system. In the past, the purpose of imperialism was to plunder our country's coal mine resources, and they did not make long-term plans at all. Moreover, at that time, our country had a large number of cheap laborers that could be exploited, and they did not pay attention to the use of machinery and safe production, so our country's coal mines suffered serious damage, and safety accidents occurred frequently. But all accidents should and can be avoided. He had been to Fushun, which was known as a super-gassy mine. There, during the period of the puppet Manchukuo and Kuomintang rule, the casualties caused by gas explosions were alarming. But now, under the leadership of the Party, engineers and workers have successfully solved the gas problem. They use the closed method to turn gas into an important industrial raw material, which is better in quality than imported goods and lower in cost; at the same time, another part of the gas is piped into the miners' homes for use as fuel for cooking and boiling water, which is both economical and clean.
    Xu Shifan, a graduate student in the open-pit mining major of the Mining and Electrical Engineering Department, introduced to the students the gains he had made during his internship at the Haizhou Open-pit Mine, my country’s first large open-pit coal mine, during the summer vacation this year. He said: "An open-pit mine is like a treasure house with its lid open. Countless black coal is exposed outside. As long as we have enough machines, we can dig as much as we want. I was very surprised when I first saw the open-pit mine. On such a huge construction site, you don't see thousands of people working there, but only rows of rails, some electric locomotives coming and going, several electric shovels and a small number of workers, engineers and technicians. A small house commands the production of the entire open-pit mine. I interned on an electric shovel for more than two weeks. Inside this large machine, which is like a small building, there are sixteen electric motors alone. The coal digging bucket is taller than a person, and its arms rotate on the working surface all day long, and it can dig three to five thousand cubic meters of coal in twenty-four hours. The highest record is more than seven thousand eight hundred cubic meters of coal in twenty-four hours. But such a huge machine only has four people per shift, and only three people actually operate it. It replaces the labor of about a thousand workers. Soviet experts once told us that during the Patriotic War, coal felt scarce; however, open-pit mines strongly supported the urgent needs of the defense industry and heavy industry at that time. Thinking of this, I deeply feel honored and proud of my major. There are many difficulties in the process of building open-pit mines in our country. We know very little about the theory of open-pit mining, and we still need to learn many complex new machines. I heard that the proportion of open-pit mining in the Soviet Union's coal mining industry has reached more than 45%, while we currently only have a countable number of open-pit mines. Thinking of this, I feel a greater sense of responsibility and strengthen my confidence and determination to study open-pit mines."
    Xie Xiuding, a student in the mine construction department, originally wanted to study civil engineering. In the first two years at the Beijing Mining Institute, he always yearned for the civil engineering department, which caused some damage to his studies. This year, he interned at the Fuxin Coal Mine and saw for the first time the huge vertical shaft inserted into the heart of the earth, absorbing endless coal reserves and spitting out five to six thousand tons of coal blocks every day. The eight- or nine-story buildings we see are only thirty meters high; but ordinary mine shafts are at least three or four hundred meters deep! When learning in class, hearing that the depth of the vertical shaft is "three or four hundred meters" does not matter. Now that the actual thing is in front of you, it really makes you feel how great the project is and how complex it is to build such a project! However, so far, our country still lacks new well-drilling talents. The call of the motherland's needs made Xie Xiuding love the mine construction major. He said: "Now, how much I love the term 'well drilling and tunnel excavation'! The motherland urgently needs more new mines, the people hope that the steel of Anshan Iron and Steel Company will flow out like a river, and hope to hear the roar of trains on the Kangzang Plateau and the Gobi Desert in Xinjiang, and the vast number of farmers hope for bright electric lights... All this is focused on the motherland's coal mines. The motherland is calling us to solve this problem, and our mine construction department is responsible for the task of building new mines for the motherland."
    Some students once regarded the coal mining industry as very simple. The most prominent is Nie Hengzhuang, a second-year student in the coal mining department. In the past, he always thought that surveying was not worth studying: "What kind of science is this, there is no theory to learn!" "Surveying work is extremely boring, is this still for college students to learn!" He had repeatedly published many arguments that belittled surveying. However, the surveying class and surveying practice educated him. In the first practice, his measurement error was more than 20 centimeters. The teacher told him: "The error cannot exceed 1.5 centimeters at most. If you use such measurement records for construction, it will cause huge waste of national resources!" Song Zhichun, Deputy Director of the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Department, once told the students some stories: In one mine, when excavating a tunnel, construction was carried out simultaneously at both ends. Due to measurement errors, the two ends differed by seven meters, and the tunnel could not be connected, causing great losses to the country. Before liberation, a mine in Shandong connected the mountain road and the river channel, resulting in the flooding of the entire mining area. The year before last, the miners of Jiaozuo Coal Mine were mining coal when they suddenly encountered a fault, and it took them half a year to find the coal seam. These were all caused by measurement errors. These facts educated Nie Hengzhuang and gave him a new understanding of the surveying profession. Now he not only loves coal mining, but also loves surveying. He is determined to be a surveying engineer.
    Coal preparation plays a very important role in the mining industry. Shan Zhongjian, a second-year student in the coal preparation department, quoted a report from a Soviet expert in his speech: If the ash content of Chinese coal is reduced by 1%, it means that under the current circumstances, 20,000 coal trucks with a load of 30 tons can be saved every year. She said: "This amazing figure tells us how important the coal preparation industry is! However, so far, the country's coal mines still lack formal coal preparation engineers. How urgently do people need us! I am determined to train myself to become a female coal preparation engineer with both moral integrity and ability. I want to dedicate my life to the coal preparation industry!" Tang Jiaqian, a first-year student, said: Coal is the food of industry, and coal preparation is to select the best food for industry. We deeply feel the importance of our responsibility. In his speech, he cited a report in the People's Daily in June, which exposed that in the first quarter of this year alone, the country wasted more than 10 billion yuan in train freight due to poor coal quality, hindering the metallurgical industry and other industrial production. He said: "This report shocked all the students in our class. We felt that the motherland urgently needs a batch of highly skilled coal preparation talents, so we are all determined to study hard and become the best coal preparation engineers."
    "Strive for the electrification of the motherland's mines!" This is the oath of the students in the electrical engineering department. Pan Dexiang, a first-year student, said: "I originally wanted to study power generation, but when I understood the unique and important significance of the electrification of coal mines, I fell in love with the mining and electrical engineering department. I have personally seen that a huge electric shovel can pick up several tons of coal at a time, and an electric automatic train can replace hundreds of laborers. I know that the automation of a mine can replace tens of thousands of laborers; and this great task is handed over to our electrical engineering department." Wu Xiaojun, who had interned in an open-pit mine, said: "In the Pingan Coal Mine pit, I saw how workers worked diligently in mine shafts that were only as tall as a person, using the light of the miner's lamp on their heads and clumsy tools. But on the pit surface, I saw the performance of the 'Donbass-1' combine like in the movie 'Donbass Miners': with the push of an electric button, the cutting disc, crushing disc and conveyor started at the same time, and coal cutting and loading were carried out simultaneously. I also saw the latest Soviet large-scale electric shovels and shifting machines working in the Haizhou Open-pit Mine. This made me deeply realize that our coal mining industry must take the road of automation and mechanization. And currently, our country lacks mining and electrical engineering talents. The new Soviet machine coal cutter is used to cut bottom grooves in the Fuxin Coal Mine, but cannot exert its full efficiency. In this internship, I deeply realized that having rich knowledge of coal mining, machinery and electrical engineering is a minimum requirement for being a mining and electrical engineering worker, and what our country's coal mines lack is such technical talents. I must study hard and become an electrical engineering cadre with knowledge of electrical engineering, machinery, and coal mining."
    The students love their majors, and they are grateful to the motherland for creating the conditions for them to master technology. Jiang Hanxin, a graduate student in the underground mining major of the coal mining department, said: "The country has created such good learning conditions for us: we study in newly built school buildings, and our school has all the new types of machines for coal mines. When we go to any factory or mine for practice, we are warmly welcomed and helped by the cadres, engineers and workers there. The miners also take out their bonuses to make models for us for practice. Our learning environment is so good, if we don't study hard, we will be too sorry for the motherland and the people!" Tang Jiaqian said: "One of the forces that encourages us to study well is the education of the new type of university. We love our school, it is our warm home."
    The students who participated in the symposium all expressed their determination and wishes. Their common will is: under the education and training of the Party, study hard, train themselves to become excellent coal mine engineers, and strive for the prosperity and development of the motherland's coal mining industry.

    为祖国的煤矿事业而学习
    ——记北京矿业学院同学座谈会
    杨芝秀  马兰英  许世范
    开学日的前几天，北京矿业学院（原中国矿业学院）举行了一个座谈会。参加这次座谈会的，包括各系、各专业的同学，他们在会上的发言是热烈的。可以看出，对于煤，同学们都已经有了比较深的感情了。他们把乌亮的煤称为“黑色的金子”。采煤系一年级甲班马兰英同学说：我一看到煤，就觉得这是祖国的瓌宝，是自己最亲爱的朋友，“我将和煤永远生活在一起”。她谈到了什么是幸福。她说：“什么是我的幸福呢？这就是今天的学习和明天的工作。当我掌握了先进的采煤技术，把一车车的煤运到祖国各地，带给祖国人民以幸福、温暖和光明的时候，我觉得这就是我们采煤工作者的幸福。”
    这种热爱煤矿事业的感情，对于许多同学来说，早在进入中国矿业学院以前就有了。采煤系一年级的何亚男同学，在高中读书时就确立了学习采煤的志愿。那时，她像一切前进的同学一样，经常关怀着祖国建设事业在各方面的发展。一九五一年四五月间在北京劳动人民文化宫举行的全国煤矿生产展览会给了她深刻的教育。展览会的图表和模型向她说明：我国有着极为丰富的矿藏。我们的祖先在汉朝就发现了煤，但不知开采。自从帝国主义的势力侵入中国，我国的矿山始终是他们的抢掠对象；光是在八年抗日战争中，日本帝国主义就从中国掠夺去了近四亿吨煤。抗日战争胜利以后，国民党反动派不管煤矿生产，不顾矿工死活，许多煤矿遭受破坏。但是，解放后从一九四九年到一九五一年的两年间，在中国共产党领导下，许多矿井都修复了，生产效率提高了很多。特别使她兴奋的是，当时有一位风镐手的生产纪录，已超过苏联斯大哈诺夫首创第一次新纪录时候的水平。但图表又说明：当时我国年产煤量与苏联的产煤量还相差很远。她不明白为什么我们的煤产量这样少，就去问讲解员。讲解员是北京矿业学院的学生。他说：“这除了帝国主义和反动派破坏矿山等等的原因以外，过去许多青年都认为学采煤是‘倒霉’的事，不想学采煤，也是原因之一。”
    参观回去，展览会的印象以及那位讲解员的声音，长久地在她脑海里回旋。从那时起，她便深深地爱上了煤矿事业。高中毕业后，她就投考了北京矿业学院。
    采煤系二年级王振铎同学，在投考大学时，把五个志愿都填了“采矿系”。他爱好地理，从中学时代起就有把伟大祖国丰富的地下宝藏开发出来的理想。但是到北京矿业学院之初，听到有些同学谈起，采煤工作很苦，而且由于瓦斯爆炸还有生命危险，这竟把他吓住了。他想：采煤，这简直是拼命。曾有一段时间，他在学习上表现得无精打彩。但是不久他懂得了，那是一定的社会制度的产物。过去，帝国主义的目的在掠夺我国的煤矿资源，根本不做长远打算，而且，那时我国有着大批可以榨取的廉价劳动力，他们也根本不注意利用机械和安全生产，因此我国的煤矿遭到了严重的破坏，安全事故层出不穷。但是一切事故是应该而且可以避免的。他曾到过被人称为超级瓦斯矿的抚顺，那里，在伪满和国民党统治时代，因瓦斯爆炸而发生的伤亡是惊人的。可是现在，在党的领导下，工程师们和工人们出色地解决了瓦斯问题。他们利用封闭方法，把瓦斯制造成为某项重要的工业原料，质量比进口货好，成本又低；同时，另一部分瓦斯用管导入矿工家中，利用它来做燃料，煮饭、烧水，既省钱，又干净。
    矿山电机系露天开采专业的研究生许世范同学向同学们介绍了今年暑假他在我国第一个露天大煤矿——海州露天矿实习的收获。他说：“露天矿，就像是揭开盖子的大宝库，无数乌黑的煤露在外面，只要我们有足够的机器，要挖多少就挖多少。我初次见到露天矿时，十分惊讶。在这样巨大面积的工地上，不是成千上万的人在那里劳动，看到的只是一条条铁轨、来来往往的一些电机车、若干座电铲和人数不多的工人、工程师和技术人员。一间小房子指挥着整个露天矿的生产。我曾经在电铲上实习过两个多礼拜，在这座像小楼房似的大机器里面，仅仅电机就有十六台，挖煤的斗比人还高，整天在工作面上转动着它的手臂，二十四小时可以挖煤三、五千立方公尺，最高纪录达到二十四小时挖煤七千八百多立方公尺。可是像这样庞大的机器每班只是四个人，实际操作的只有三人，它代替了约一千工人的劳动。苏联专家曾经告诉过我们，在卫国战争期间，煤感到了缺乏；但是，露天矿有力地支持了当时国防工业和重工业的急需。想到这些，我深深地为自己的专业感到光荣和骄傲。我国在建设露天矿过程中，是存在着许多困难的，关于露天开矿的理论，我们知道得还很少，许多复杂的新机器，我们还要学习。听说苏联目前露天开采在采煤事业中的比重已达到百分之四十五以上，而我们现在还只有可数的几个露天矿，想到这些，又使我感到责任的重大，使我愈加坚定了学习露天矿的信心和决心。”
    矿山建筑系解修定同学原先的志愿是学习土木建筑。到北京矿业学院的头二年，他始终向往着土木建筑系，这使他的学业受到了一些损失。今年他到阜新煤矿实习，第一次看到巨大的插入地球心脏的竖井，吸取着无尽的煤藏，每天就要吐出五六千吨煤块。我们所看到的八九层高的楼房，它的高度不过三十来公尺；可是普通的矿井，最浅的都有三四百公尺！在课堂学习时，听到竖井深度有“三四百公尺”并不在意，现在实际东西摆在眼前，真使人感到那是多么伟大的工程，建筑这种工程又该是多么的复杂！可是，到现在为止，我国还缺乏新型的凿井人材。祖国需要的感召，使解修定同学热爱了矿山建筑专业。他说：“现在，我是多么喜爱‘凿井开巷’这个名词啊！祖国迫切需要更多的新矿井，人民希望鞍钢的钢铁像河流一样的流出来，希望早日听到康藏高原和新疆大沙漠上有火车嘶吼，广大农民希望亮莹莹的电灯光……这一切都注视着祖国的煤井。祖国在召唤我们，要我们解决这个问题，我们矿山建筑系就担负了这一建设祖国新矿山的任务。”
    曾经有些同学把采煤事业看得十分简单。最突出的莫如采煤系二年级的聂恒庄同学了。他过去总认为测量不值一学：“这能算什么科学呢，毫无理论可学！”“测量工作无味极了，这还是给大学生学的！”他曾经接二连三地发表过许多轻视测量的论调。但是，测量课和测量实习教育了他。在第一次实习中，他的测量误差有二十几厘米。老师告诉他：“误差最多不能超过一点五厘米，如果用你这样的测量记录去施工，那会给国家浪费巨大的资财！”中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局宋之春副局长曾经给同学们讲过一些故事：有一个矿，在开掘巷道的时候，两端同时施工，由于测量错误，两端相差七公尺，巷道接不通，给国家造成了很大的损失。解放以前，山东某矿把山道和河道打通了，结果把整个矿区淹没了。前年，焦作煤矿的矿工正在采煤，突然遇见了断层，花了半年的功夫才找到煤层。这些都是测量错误所造成的。这些事实教育了聂恒庄同学，使他对测量专业有了新的认识。现在他不仅热爱着采煤，而且也热爱着测量了。他立志做一个测量工程师。
    选煤在采矿事业中，占有十分重要的地位。选煤系二年级的单忠健同学在发言中引述了苏联专家的报告：如果中国出煤的灰分降低百分之一，就意味着在现有情况下，每年能节约两万辆载重三十吨的煤车。她说：“这个惊人的数字告诉我们，选煤事业多么重要！可是，到目前为止，全国煤矿中还缺乏正式的选煤工程师，人民是多么迫切地需要我们！我立志要把自己锻炼成为一个德才兼备的女选煤工程师。我要把自己的一生献给选煤事业！”一年级的汤家骞同学说：煤是工业的粮食，选煤就是为工业选择最好的粮食。我们深深地感到自己责任的重大。他在发言中援引了人民日报六月份的一次报道，这个报道揭发了仅在今年第一季度，由于煤的质量不好，给国家浪费了一百多亿元的火车运费，妨碍了冶金工业和其他工业生产的事实。他说：“这个报道使我们全班同学都震动起来了，我们感到祖国是多么迫切需要一批有高度技术的选煤人材，因此都决心努力学习，做一个最优秀的选煤工程师。”
    “为祖国矿山的电气化而奋斗！”这是电机系同学们的誓言。一年级的潘德祥同学说：“我本来是想学发电的，但是当我懂得了煤矿的电气化有它独特的重大意义时，我就热爱了矿山电机系。我曾亲眼看见过，巨大的电铲一下可啃几吨煤，一列电气自动车可以替代几百个劳动力，我知道：一个矿山的自动化就能代替几万个劳动力；而这一伟大的任务就交给了我们电机系。”曾经到过露天矿实习的吴孝浚同学说：“在平安煤矿坑下，我看到了工人们如何在仅及人高的矿井里，借自己头上矿灯的光亮，用不太灵便的工具，辛勤地工作。但是在坑面，我看到了像‘顿巴斯矿工’电影里一样的‘顿巴斯——一型’康拜因的表演：电钮一按，割盘、破碎盘和运输机一齐开动，煤的采割、装运同时进行。我还在海州露天矿看到最新式的苏联大型电铲和移道机在工作。这使我深深地体会到，我们的煤矿工业必须走自动化和机械化的道路。而目前我国的煤矿电机人材太缺乏了，苏联新机器割煤机在阜新煤矿应用于割底槽，不能发挥它的全部效率。在这次实习中，我深刻地体会到，具备有采煤、机械和电机三方面的丰富知识，是做为一个矿山电机工作者的起码条件，而我国煤矿缺少的，正是这样的技术人材。我一定要努力学习，使自己成为一个具备电机、机械、采煤三方面知识的电机工程干部。”
    同学们热爱自己的专业，他们感激祖国给自己创造了掌握技术的条件。采煤系地下开采专业研究生姜汉信说：“国家给我们创造了多么好的学习条件：我们在新建的校舍里学习，所有关于煤矿的新型机器，我们学校都有。到任何工厂、矿山实习，都得到那里的干部、工程师和工人们的热情的欢迎和帮助，矿工同志们还把他们的奖金拿出来制成模型送给我们作实习之用。我们的学习环境这样好，要是再不好好学习，实在是太对不起祖国和人民了！”汤家骞同学说：“鼓舞我们学好功课的力量之一，是新型大学对我们的教育。我们爱自己的学校，它是我们温暖的家。”
    参加座谈会的同学都谈出了自己的决心和愿望，他们共同的意志是：在党的教育和培养下，努力学习，把自己锻炼成为一个优秀的煤矿工程师，为祖国煤矿事业的繁荣和发展而奋斗。
