    Xinjiang Textile Factory Does Not Cherish National Wealth
    Large Quantities of Machine Parts Left to Wind and Rain
    A letter from Chang Fuxing, Deputy Chief of the Finance Section, Chang Fengyi, Cost Accountant, and Chen Futang of the Xinjiang Textile Factory: The local state-owned Xinjiang Textile Factory in Shanxi Province has more than one hundred Fengtai-style hand looms. Because the parts were incomplete, they could not be installed and used. Most of the machine parts were piled up outside the factory's warehouse in the open air, exposed to wind, rain, sun, and dew for more than a year. Now the machines are covered in rust. Apart from the loom frames, 90% of the machine parts, some are no longer up to standard due to corrosion, and some, although up to standard, have shortened their service life. Some machine parts are also piled in the motor road. Because no one checks them, they have been exposed to moisture for years and have developed thick rust. The parts of the 324 looms that have been installed and started operating, such as picking sticks and picking bands, have also lost their proper function due to poor storage in the past and break soon after being installed on the machines. Therefore, downtime accidents occur frequently, and our factory's production has been greatly affected. The rate of second-class cloth is often above 30%. What is more noteworthy is that, according to our understanding, the Xinjiang Textile Factory's excess reserve materials and stagnant materials are worth about 5 billion yuan in total. Among them, dozens of tons of good water pipes and steam pipes have also rusted because they were left in the open air. This serious situation of stockpiling materials in large quantities and not taking good care of them urgently needs to attract the attention of relevant leading departments and management units.

### 新绛纺织厂不爱护国家财富  大批机件听任风吹雨淋

    新绛纺织厂不爱护国家财富
    大批机件听任风吹雨淋
    新绛纺织厂财务科副科长常复兴、成本会计员常凤移、陈富棠来信：山西省地方国营新绛纺织厂有一百多台丰台式的上打手织布机，因零件不全未能安装使用，大部分机件被堆在该厂仓库外面露天地里，风吹雨淋、日晒夜露已有年余。现在机器上已生满了锈，除了布机车架以外，百分之九十的机器零件中，有的因腐蚀已不合规格，有的虽合规格但缩短了耐用年限。还有一部分机件堆放在马达道内，也由于无人检查，经年受着潮气侵袭而生了很厚的锈。已经安装起来开始运转的三百二十四台布机的零件，如打梭棒和打梭皮带等，也由于过去保管不善而失去了应有的性能，安在机器上运转不久就要折断。因此，停车事故时常发生，我厂生产受到了很大影响，次布率经常在百分之三十以上。更值得注意的是，据我们了解，新绛纺织厂的超额储备物资和呆滞材料，共计价值约五十余亿元。其中有数十吨好水管和汽管也因放在露天而生了不少铁锈。这种既大量积压物资又不很好保管的严重情况，亟应引起有关领导部门和经管单位的注意。
