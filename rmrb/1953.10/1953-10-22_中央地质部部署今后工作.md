The Central Geological Department recently issued instructions on the current situation of geological work and future work arrangements. The instructions pointed out: Geological work is a preliminary step for industrial construction, especially heavy industrial construction. Whether it is the construction of iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, coal, petroleum, or some building materials and chemical industries, sufficient and reliable geological data must be available as a basis before design. Therefore, geological work should provide enough mineral resources according to the requirements of different industries and reasonable depreciation periods, and collect comprehensive technical and economic data for future mining, beneficiation, and smelting for industrial departments to use for design. However, due to the weak foundation of geological work in our country, there is a great contradiction between geological exploration forces and tasks. Therefore, the basic tasks of geological work in the future are: to rapidly grow and strengthen its forces on the existing basis according to the requirements of national construction, to build a strong geological work team, to first ensure the timely completion of the mineral resources required for important construction projects in the first five-year plan, and at the same time, to prepare for the needs of the second five-year plan in a step-by-step manner, and gradually change the current backward and passive state of geological work.

The instructions affirmed that geological work has made great achievements and progress in implementing the policy of great development and great transformation. This is mainly manifested in: First, it has implemented unified and centralized leadership, carried out the rational allocation and rational use of technical personnel, constructed and expanded geological, drilling, trenching, geophysical prospecting, geochemical prospecting, surveying, and testing exploration forces, and greatly strengthened the geological work team. Second, it has formulated and implemented geological exploration plans, and brought geological work into the orbit of the national plan. In order to guarantee the mineral quantity requirements of iron, copper, coal, lead, and zinc for heavy industrial construction and to find other resources, the work policy of focusing on key exploration and appropriately conducting general surveys was determined according to urgency. Each key exploration team already has the conditions and foundation to submit estimated mineral quantities and various data on schedule. Many general survey teams have also achieved certain results. Geological scientific research work has also closely combined resource exploration to carry out a lot of work. Third, it has mobilized the vast number of workers, technicians, and staff to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. For example, in geology, it has learned and adopted scientific exploration designs and exploration methods, methods for determining mineral quantity grades and calculating mineral quantities, geological observation point working methods, various map drawing methods, groove sampling, and heavy sand sampling methods. In drilling, the one-time sand injection method has been widely promoted, and the mud drilling method has been partially piloted. In testing, advanced analysis methods and fast-flowing operation methods have been adopted. In geophysical prospecting, methods such as magnetic, gravity, resistivity, and natural current have been used to closely cooperate with exploration and achieve results. Through learning and practice, technical personnel have undergone great changes and progress in technical viewpoints and methods, workers' technical levels have also been improved, and work quality has been improved. Fourth, the leadership has grasped the main links in the process of work development, convened planning meetings and geological meetings, and solved the problems of what to do and how to do it. It has carried out timely and continuous inspection work, revised exploration designs and plans, launched a struggle against bureaucracy, and initially established production management and responsibility systems, and initially overcame the chaotic situation. Leaders at all levels are exploring and advancing, and have found some ways in learning by doing.

The instructions pointed out that there are still many shortcomings and errors in the current geological work and leadership, which must be criticized and overcome:

First, in terms of geological work: First of all, there are still many problems in the exploration procedures and exploration designs. Many tasks have violated the exploration procedures. For example, some surface geological work is not sufficient, and the accuracy of geological maps is not enough. Exploration designs and construction are carried out based on this incomplete and inaccurate geological map, resulting in rework and waste. Many trench explorations or well explorations that should be carried out during geological surveys are squeezed together with drilling and trenching in mine exploration, resulting in heavy engineering and passive work. Some drill holes and tunnels are arranged mechanically and formalistically without considering the specific geological conditions and ore body conditions, so they cannot achieve the desired results. In the construction sequence of drilling and tunnels, efforts should first be placed on the most promising sections, from near to far, from shallow to deep, and advance sequentially according to the extension and change of the ore body (layer). However, some units carry out long-distance and deep drilling away from the ore body, and some units do not care about the changes in the ore body, but advance in parallel according to the already arranged drill hole sequence, pushing flat at one time.

Secondly, there is a lack of comprehensive research work in geological surveys and mine exploration. The work of data collation and map compilation is very poor, and the exploration results are not used in a timely and sufficient manner to conduct detailed research on the geological structure and ore body shape and quality of the mining area, so as to continuously supplement and correct the understanding and evaluation of the mining area. Therefore, some units, although they have carried out a lot of work, lack a clear and complete concept of the mining area, and some still stay at the stage of the early survey of the mining area. This affects the comprehensive understanding and mastery of the deposit, and also loses the close guidance of the prospecting project.

Thirdly, ore analysis, identification, and processing test work are lagging behind geological and prospecting work. Only 10% of the analysis tasks were completed in the first half of the year, and processing tests are still in the preparation stage. This is because: on the one hand, some construction sites do not pay attention to systematic sampling work, fail to sample in time or the sampling does not meet the standards, and fail to submit ore samples to the laboratory in time, in quantity, and according to the standards, so that most laboratories are in a state of suspension waiting for samples. On the other hand, some laboratories have not fully mastered advanced analysis methods, and the management system is not strict, resulting in many errors and frequent rework, and cannot produce analysis results in a timely and accurate manner. This reduces the indicative effect of analysis and identification work on geological work, and greatly affects the progress of exploration work and the mastery of ore quality indicators.

Fourth, the guidance of the entire exploration project is not enough. Many units have not provided ideal columnar diagrams or cross-sectional diagrams to drilling and trenching in time, have not strictly checked the quality of the project, and the contact between geology and construction departments is not close enough. Some units even geological personnel are unwilling to intervene in trenching and drilling. This puts the prospecting project in a state of blindness to some extent.

Fifth, hydrogeological surveys are not sufficient. Most geological personnel lack experience in carrying out this work, but at the same time, they have not paid enough attention to it.

The reasons for the above errors and shortcomings, in addition to the urgency of the task, the lack of manpower, and the lack of experience, are primarily due to an insufficient understanding of the purpose and comprehensiveness of geological work, an unclear concept of finding minerals and obtaining mineral quantities, a lack of necessary industrial technical knowledge, an unclear understanding of design requirements, and therefore a failure to fully grasp the work, collect comprehensive data according to design needs, and give economic and technical evaluations of mining and beneficiation. The spirit and essence of the Soviet Union's advanced experience has not been studied enough, understood deeply, and is not good at specific application. When implementing expert suggestions and operating specifications, they often do not understand the specific purpose, do not look at the effect, and do not work according to the actual situation, resulting in a rigid and formalistic approach. The leadership at all levels is not specific enough in leading geological work, lacks strict technical management and organizational work, and fails to grasp the work of various aspects of exploration in a unified manner, so that they can closely cooperate and develop in a balanced manner. In large-scale geological exploration work, many comrades still use handicraft-style working methods and leadership methods.

Second, in terms of drilling work: The main problems are low quality, many accidents, and low efficiency. The quality of teams and drilling rigs is extremely unbalanced, and production capacity has not been fully utilized. Most units failed to complete the quantity and quality tasks in the first and second quarters. The average core recovery rate in the first half of the year was only 58.4%, and most units did not meet the quality standards. Moreover, most of them did not calculate general rock and effective ore layers separately. Some of the cores taken out on the ore body were even lower than the cores of general rock taken out, and some drilling rigs even passed through the ore layer without taking out the cores. The result of drilling for the sake of drilling makes it impossible to understand the existence and thickness of the ore body, and it is impossible to analyze the ore grade and quality. It is a more serious loss and waste than slow footage. The average monthly footage per drilling rig in the first half of the year was only 68.68 meters, and the efficiency was very low. The main reason is that there are too many accidents. Almost one-third of the drilling rigs in each team are often dealing with accidents. In terms of time utilization, pure drilling time and accident time are almost equal (both accounting for more than 20%). In terms of accidents, mechanical accidents and downhole accidents are the most common, and most of them are responsibility accidents.

The above shortcomings and errors are caused by the sudden increase in new workers, low technical level, and too few technical personnel, in addition to objective reasons, mainly due to weak production management and technical management. First of all, the idea of emphasizing footage but not core has not been completely reversed, and the significant role of core taking in prospecting is not understood. Some teams have also paid attention to it, but lack effective measures. Secondly, the technical education of workers is not enough. Many workers have a strong tendency of empiricism, operate irregularly, each person has their own set, and one master passes on one method. Thirdly, there is a lack of strict production management and responsibility system. The leadership is not good at organizing production in a specific way. There are many phenomena of no one being responsible in production. Some of the established systems are also reduced to formalism due to the lack of inspection.

Third, in addition to the above problems, there is a lack of comprehensive exploration work. In the tasks undertaken by the Ministry of Geology, the following weak points must be seriously noted. The main ones are the exploration work for coking coal, flux (limestone, dolomite, etc.), and refractory materials (silica, refractory clay, etc.) that support the steel industry, which are in danger of falling behind the exploration of iron ore and design requirements. The general survey and exploration of manganese, chromium, nickel ore, etc. are also lagging behind.

Fourth, financial and supply work has basically guaranteed the needs of production and work, but due to the multiple changes in the plan and the insufficient normal production, financial and supply work has been quite passive, and the phenomenon of waiting for work to stop and waiting for funds has not been eliminated, and there is a serious phenomenon of backlog and waste. The reason is that the supply and demand situation cannot be specifically grasped, the plan is not thorough, the mechanical equipment is unbalanced, and the accessories are incomplete, which affects the production process; the material and financial management system and accounting system have not been seriously established, which prolongs the chaos and causes many man-made phenomena of supply falling short of demand.

The instructions pointed out that some of the above shortcomings and errors are inevitable in the process of great development, and most of them are caused by insufficient subjective efforts. In particular, it is inseparable from the lack of experience, low level, and insufficient attention to work on the part of the leadership. First of all, there is a lack of systematic and regular political and ideological leadership. The policy of great development and great transformation has been implemented, but the difficulties in the great development have been underestimated, and the initial requirements were a bit urgent. The central link of each period has been grasped, but there is still a lack of centrally coordinating and comprehensively and balanced work. The strengthening of weak links is very slow. The vast number of employees, technicians, and staff of the ministry, bureau, and team are not fully mobilized and not in-depth. Sufficient attention has not been paid to the material and cultural life of field teams. Secondly, the level of production management and business leadership is not high. The completion of the production plan of each team is not strictly checked, and the assistance to backward departments and units is not enough. The correct original records have not been established, and there is a lack of a complete and reasonable quota. The responsibility system has not been truly established. The ministry, bureau, and team still have different degrees of unclear division of labor, unclear responsibilities, no cooperation, no connection, and a bureaucratic style of slow handling and inefficient work.

In order to quickly eliminate the shortcomings in the work and complete the annual geological exploration tasks, the instructions finally pointed out: In the next few months, the most important issue is to ensure the completion of the exploration plans for various key projects on schedule, and at the same time strive to achieve certain results in the general survey. In guidance, it is necessary to ensure key points, improve quality, and develop in a balanced manner. To this end, the following work must be done well:

First, strengthen geological work and strengthen the leadership of geological work. Grasp the basic link of writing work reports on schedule to promote the work in all aspects. Each key team must submit reports on the expected mineral quantity and complete economic and technical data by the end of the year, and the general survey team must draw accurate geological maps and preliminary evaluation reports of the mining area on schedule. To this end, it is necessary to resolutely implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, creatively apply the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, understand its spirit and essence, and carry out work based on reality and seeking truth from facts. Strengthen the comprehensive geological research work in exploration, continuously collect, sort out, study, and correct various data, draw various maps in a timely manner, and calculate the mineral quantity once a month to keep abreast of the situation. Immediately check the sampling work, organize forces to carry out a blitz sampling, and those who have sampled but do not meet the standards should re-sample to ensure that they are sent to the laboratory for analysis on time and in quantity. At the same time, pay attention to the identification of rocks and minerals, and urge relevant departments to conduct processing tests. Establish a guidance and technical responsibility system for drilling and tunneling. The geological department should be responsible for the designation of drill (tunnel) hole sequence, hole location measurement, propose ideal columnar diagrams, indicate stratigraphic conditions and geological requirements, stop drilling midway or deepen excessively due to changes in geological conditions during drilling, core inspection and storage, and formulate methods for collecting and managing rock powder and rock mud; and should closely contact the construction department to jointly guide the project. Solve the problem of cooperation between geology and surveying, improve the quality of surveying, and strengthen mapping work. Correctly grasp the physical prospecting work so that it closely cooperates with the prospecting project.

Second, strengthen the production management of drilling work. In the future, it is necessary to complete the quality and quantity indicators by improving the core recovery rate and eliminating accidents. The instructions stipulate: The core taking should distinguish between general rock and effective ore layer for separate calculation. For general rock, the core rate shall not be less than 60%, and for effective ore bodies, the core rate shall be above 75%. In the methods of improving the core recovery rate, advanced experience should be summarized and promoted. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to collecting rock powder and rock mud to supplement the lack of core. In eliminating accidents, the main thing is to strengthen technical management and production management, implement operating procedures, and establish a responsibility system. Vigorously promote the mud drilling method to eliminate serious accidents such as downhole collapse and water leakage. Correctly use the one-time sand injection method, distinguish stratigraphic conditions, and prescribe a reasonable amount of sand injection. Establish a machine maintenance system, diligent inspection and maintenance, to avoid small accidents turning into big accidents. In the establishment of the responsibility system, the three main systems should be promoted on the drilling rig, namely the division of labor responsibility system, the shift handover system, and the technical security system. In the team and construction department, a production command and technical responsibility system should be established. Strengthen the original record work, requiring accuracy and timeliness, accumulate and formulate various economic and technical quotas. Strengthen the education of employees to cherish national property, mobilize the masses to cherish machines, and practice strict economy.

Third, quickly eliminate the backward phenomenon of testing work. Check and revise the liaison contracts between the teams and the laboratories, requiring each team to submit ore samples on schedule, and at the same time strengthen the political leadership and organizational leadership of the laboratories, assign more administrative leaders, strengthen management, improve analysis efficiency, reduce errors, and strictly conduct internal and external inspections to ensure quality and complete the quantity.

Fourth, continue to carry out scientific research work and the collation of national geological data, so as to study the national geological structure in a step-by-step manner, understand underground resources and their distribution, and better plan exploration work. Unify the registration and statistics of the geological exploration work carried out nationwide, collect data in a timely manner, and gradually compile a balance sheet of burial volume, so as to correctly calculate mineral quantities for the rational use of national construction.

Fifth, strengthen leadership, oppose decentralism, subjectivism, and bureaucracy. Strictly implement the request for instructions and reporting system, and continue to carry out inspection work, especially inspection and assistance to key teams. Pay attention to systematically summarizing experience and conducting special studies to improve the level of business leadership. Pay attention to carefully analyzing the situation, grasping the central link, and effectively eliminating backward links, so as to complete the task in a balanced and comprehensive manner. Strengthen ideological work, political work, and worker mass work, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of employees and technicians. In view of the fact that the geological exploration team is newly formed, cadres, technicians, and workers come from all sides, and their level of awareness and ideological style are different, and they lack experience, generally speaking, we should emphasize unity (unite around the Party and fight for the completion of national tasks), and emphasize improvement (including both ideological and political and business and technical aspects). We must learn from each other, respect each other, and carry out criticism and self-criticism to ensure unity. Establish a political work organization, under the leadership and supervision of the party committees at all levels, to ensure the completion of the national geological exploration tasks.

    中央地质部部署今后工作
    中央人民政府地质部最近发出目前地质工作情况与今后工作部署的指示。指示指出：地质工作是工业建设尤其是重工业建设的先行步骤。不论是钢铁、有色金属、煤炭、石油、以及一部分建筑材料和化学工业的建设，在设计之前，均必须要有充分可靠的地质资料作为依据。因此地质工作应根据不同产业的要求与合理的折旧年限，提供足够的矿量，并且搜集将来开采、选矿、冶炼时的全面技术经济资料，供工业部门设计之用。但由于我国地质工作的基础薄弱，地质勘探力量与任务存在着很大的矛盾，因此，地质工作今后的基本任务是：按照国家建设的要求，在现有基础上迅速生长与壮大力量，建设一支坚强的地质工作队伍，首先按时保证作出第一个五年计划中重要建设项目所需的矿产资源，同时有步骤地准备第二个五年计划的需要，逐渐改变目前地质工作的落后状态和被动局面。
    指示肯定地质工作在执行大发展大转变的方针中是有很大成绩和进步的。这主要表现为：第一、实行了统一集中的领导，进行了技术人员的合理调配与合理使用，建设和扩大了地质、钻探、坑探、地球物理探矿、地球化学探矿、测量、化验等勘探力量，大大加强了地质工作的队伍。第二、编制和执行了地质勘查计划，把地质工作纳入了国家计划的轨道。为保证重工业建设的铁、铜、煤、铅、锌的矿量要求及寻找其他资源，按缓急轻重，确定了重点勘探、适当地进行普查的工作方针。各重点勘探队已经有了按期交出预计矿量和各种资料的条件和基础。许多普查队也获得了一定的结果。地质科学研究工作，也密切地结合了资源勘探进行了许多工作。第三、发动广大工人、技术人员、职员学习了苏联先进经验，贯彻了苏联专家的建议。如在地质方面，学习和采用了科学的勘探设计和勘探方法、确定矿量等级和计算矿量的方法、地质观察点工作法、各种图件绘制法、刻槽取样和重砂取样法等。在钻探方面，普遍推广了一次投砂法，部分试行了泥浆作业法等。在化验方面，采取了先进的分析方法和快速流水作业法等。在地球物理探矿方面，采用磁力、重力、电阻、自然电流等方法，密切配合了勘探，取得了效果。经过学习和实践，技术人员在技术观点和方法上有了很大转变和进步，工人技术水平亦有所提高，工作质量已有改进。第四、领导上抓住了工作发展过程的主要环节，召集了计划会议、地质会议，解决了作什么和如何作的问题。及时地和不断地进行了检查工作，修正了勘探设计和计划，开展了反对官僚主义的斗争，开始建立了生产管理和责任制度，初步克服了混乱局面。各级领导都在摸索前进，且作且学中摸到了一些门路。
    指示指出，目前地质工作中和领导上还存在许多缺点和错误，必须加以批判与克服：
    第一、在地质工作方面：首先，是勘探程序及勘探设计上还存在不少问题。有不少工作是违反了勘探程序的。如有的地面地质工作作的不够充分，地质图的精度不够，就根据了这种不完全、不精确的地质图，进行了勘探设计与施工，结果与实际情况不符，造成返工浪费。许多在地质普查时应作的槽探或井探都与矿区勘探中的钻探、坑探挤在一起，形成工程繁重，工作被动。有的未根据具体的地质情况、矿体情况，机械地、形式主义地布置了钻眼和坑道，因而不能收到应有的效果。在钻探和坑道的施工顺序上，应该首先把力量放在最有把握的地段上，由近及远，由浅而深，根据矿体（层）延伸变化，循序前进，但有些单位则远离矿体进行远钻深钻，有些单位不管矿体变化，而按已经排定的钻眼顺序齐头并进，一次平推。
    其次，在地质普查和矿区勘探中，缺乏综合的研究工作。资料的整理和图件的编制工作作的很差，也没有随时地、充分地利用勘探结果，对矿区地质构造和矿体形状、质量进行详细研究，以不断地补充、修正对矿区的认识和评价。因此，有的单位，虽然进行了许多工作，但对于矿区缺乏一个明确完整的概念，有的对于矿区还停留于很早以前普查阶段的认识上。这样就影响了对于矿床的全面了解和掌握，也失掉了对探矿工程的密切指导。
    再次，矿石分析、鉴定工作和加工试验工作落后于地质、探矿工作。上半年只完成分析任务百分之十，加工试验目前尚处于筹备阶段。这是因为：一方面某些工地不重视系统采样工作，未能及时采样或采样不合标准，未能按时、按量、按标准送交矿样，使大部分化验室处于停工待样状态。另一方面有些化验室未能完全掌握先进的分析方法，管理制度不严，以致差错很多，经常返工，不能及时、正确地作出分析结果。这样就降低了分析、鉴定工作对地质工作的指示作用，大大影响到勘探工作的进行和对于矿石质量指数的掌握。
    第四、对整个勘探工程指导不够，许多单位未及时供给钻探、坑探以理想柱状图或剖面图，未严格检查工程的质量，地质与工务部门联系不够密切，甚至有的单位地质人员不愿过问坑探和钻探。这样就使探矿工程处于某种程度的盲目状态。
    第五、水文地质调查作的不够，大多数地质人员缺乏进行这个工作的经验，但同时也未予以足够的重视。
    产生上述错误、缺点的原因，除了任务急、人手少、缺乏经验以外，首先是由于对于地质工作的目的性、综合性认识不够，找矿和求得矿量的观念不明确，缺乏必要的工业技术知识，不明设计要求，因而不能全面掌握工作，按照设计需要，收集全面资料，并对矿山的开采选炼上给以经济的和技术的评价。对于苏联先进经验的精神实质研究不够、体会不深、不善于具体运用。在执行专家建议和操作规范时，往往不明具体目的、不看效果、不根据实际情况进行工作，产生了生搬硬套的形式主义。各级领导对于地质工作的具体领导不够，缺乏严密的技术管理和组织工作，未能将探勘各个方面的工作统一掌握，抓住关键，使之密切配合和均衡地发展。在大规模的地质勘探工作中不少同志还沿用着手工业式的工作方法和领导方法。
    第二、在钻探工作方面：主要是质量低、事故多、效率不高，队与队、钻机与钻机好坏极不平衡，生产能力还远远未发挥起来。一、二季度大多数单位皆未完成数量和质量任务，上半年岩心采取率平均只达到百分之五十八点四，大多数单位没有达到质量标准。而且多半没有把一般岩石与有效矿层分别计算，有的在矿体上取出的岩心较取出的一般岩石岩心还低，甚至有的钻机穿过矿层而没有取出岩心。这种为打钻而打钻的结果，就无法了解矿体的有无和厚度，无法分析矿石品位和质量，它是比进尺缓慢尤为严重的损失和浪费。上半年每台钻机月进尺平均只为六十八点六八公尺，效率是很低的。主要原因是事故太多，各队差不多经常有三分之一以上的钻机在处理事故，表现在时间利用率上，纯钻进时间与事故时间几乎相等（皆占百分之二十强）。在事故上，机械事故与孔内事故最多，并且大部属于责任事故。
    上述缺点、错误的产生，除了新工人突然增多，技术水平低，技术人员太少等客观原因外，主要是由于生产管理和技术管理薄弱所致。首先表现在重进尺不重岩心的思想还未完全扭转过来，不了解采取岩心在探矿上的重大作用。有的队虽然也提起注意，但缺乏有效的措施。其次是对工人的技术教育作的不够，许多工人存在着浓厚的经验主义，操作不正规，人各一套，一个师傅一个传授。再次是缺乏严密的生产管理和责任制度，领导上不善于深入具体地组织生产，生产中存在着许多无人负责现象，建立了的一些制度也因缺乏检查而流于形式。
    第三、除了上述问题以外，缺乏综合性的勘探工作。在地质部担负的任务中，有下列薄弱部分必须引起严重的注意。主要是配合钢铁工业的炼焦煤、熔剂（石灰石、白云石等），耐火材料（矽石、耐火粘土等）等的勘查工作，有落在铁矿勘探和设计要求之后的危险。锰、铬、镍矿等的普查和勘探也还落后。
    第四、财务、供应工作，基本上保证了生产和工作的需要，但由于计划多次变更和生产不够正常，财务、供应工作相当被动，停工待料，待款现象还未能消除，同时存在着严重的积压和浪费现象。其原因是供需情况不能具体掌握，计划不周密，机械设备不平衡，配件不齐全，影响着生产的进行；材料、财务管理制度和会计制度未认真建立，延长了混乱，造成很多人为的供不应求现象。
    指示指出：上述缺点和错误的发生和存在，有一些是大发展过程中不可避免的，而大部分则是由于主观努力不够所致。尤其是与领导上缺乏经验，水平不高，工作抓得还不够紧是分不开的。首先是系统的、经常的政治、思想领导不够。大发展大转变的方针是执行了，但对于大发展中的困难估计不足，开始要求急了些。各时期的中心环节是抓住了，但还缺乏有中心地统筹兼顾、全面均衡地进行工作，薄弱环节加强的很慢。部、局、队的广大职工技术人员发动的不充分、不深入。野外队的物质文化生活未引起足够的重视。其次是生产管理和业务领导的水平不高，对于各队的生产计划完成情况检查不严，对落后部门和单位帮助不够，正确的原始记录尚未建立，缺乏一套完整的合理的定额，责任制度还未真正建立起来，部、局、队还存在着程度不同的分工不清、职责不明、不配合、不衔接的现象，以及办事迟缓，效率不高的官僚主义作风。
    为了迅速消灭工作中的缺点，完成全年地质勘察任务，指示最后指出：今后几个月，最重要的问题是保证按期完成各项重点的勘探计划，同时力争普查有一定结果。在指导上必须确保重点，提高质量，平衡发展。为此必须作好下列工作：
    第一、加强地质工作，加强对地质工作的领导。抓住按期写出工作报告这一基本环节，推动各方面的工作，各重点队年底一定要交出预期矿量和完整的经济技术资料的报告，普查队一定按期绘制出准确的地质图和矿区初步评价的报告。为此，必须坚决贯彻苏联专家建议，创造性地运用苏联先进经验，领会其精神实质，从实际出发，实事求是地进行工作。加强勘探中的地质综合研究工作，不断地搜集、整理、研究、校正各种资料，及时绘制各种图件，每月计算一次矿量，以求心中有数。立即检查采样工作，组织力量突击采样，已采样但不合规格者应重新补采，保证按时按量送交化验室分析。同时注意岩石、矿物的鉴定工作，督促有关部门进行加工试验。建立对钻探、坑探的指导与技术责任制，地质部门应当负责钻（坑）孔顺序的指定，孔位测量，提出理想柱状图，指示地层情况及地质要求，在钻进中因地质情况变化而中途停钻或超额加深，岩心检验及保管，制定岩粉岩泥收集管理办法等；并应与工务部门密切联系，共同指导工程。解决地质与测量的配合问题，提高测量质量，加强绘图工作。正确掌握物理探矿工作，使之密切地配合探矿工程。
    第二、加强钻探工作的生产管理。今后必须以提高岩心采取率和消灭事故来完成质量和数量的指标。指示规定：岩心采取要区别一般岩石和有效矿层来分别计算，一般岩石，岩心率不得低于百分之六十，在有效矿体上，岩心率应当在百分之七十五以上。在提高岩心采取率的方法上，应当总结先进经验，加以推广。此外，还必须注意搜集岩粉岩泥，以补岩心之不足。在消灭事故上，主要是加强技术管理和生产管理，贯彻操作规程，建立责任制。大力推广泥浆作业法，消灭孔内坍塌掉块漏水等严重事故。正确运用一次投砂法，区别地层条件，规定合理投砂量。建立机器检修制度，勤检、勤修，以免小事故变成大事故。在建立责任制方面，钻机上主要推行三大制度，即分工负责制、交接班制、技术保安制。在队部和工务方面，应建立生产指挥与技术责任制。加强原始记录工作，要求作到准确及时，积累和制定各种经济、技术定额。对职工加强爱护国家财产的教育，发动群众爱护机器，厉行节约。
    第三、迅速消灭化验工作的落后现象。检查和重订各队与化验室的联系合同，要求各队按期送交矿样，同时加强化验室的政治领导与组织领导，加派行政领导干部，加强管理，提高分析效率，减少差错，严格进行内外检查，以确保质量，完成数量。
    第四、继续进行科学研究工作和全国地质资料的整理工作，以便有步骤地研究全国地质构造，了解地下资源及其分布情况，更好地计划勘探工作。统一登记与统计全国所进行的地质勘察工作，及时搜集资料，逐步编制埋藏量平衡表，以便正确计算矿量，供国家建设的合理使用。
    第五、加强领导，反对分散主义、主观主义和官僚主义。严格请示报告制度，继续进行检查工作——尤其是对重点队的检查帮助。注意系统地总结经验，进行专题研究，以提高业务领导水平。注意细密地分析情况，抓住中心环节，有效地消灭落后环节，以便均衡地全面地完成任务。加强思想工作政治工作和工人群众工作，发挥广大职工和技术人员的积极性、创造性。针对着地质勘探队伍是新组成，干部技术人员和工人来自各方，觉悟程度不同，思想作风不同，而又缺乏经验等情况，从总的方面说，应该强调团结（团结在党的周围，为完成国家任务而斗争），强调提高（包括思想政治和业务技术两方面）。要互相学习，互相尊重，开展批评与自我批评，以保证团结。建立政治工作机构，在各级党委的领导与监督下，保证国家地质勘探任务的完成。
