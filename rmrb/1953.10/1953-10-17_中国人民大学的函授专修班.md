    Correspondence Courses at the People's University of China
    China People's University Correspondence Department
    To meet the needs of large-scale national economic construction and solve the difficulties of the majority of on-the-job cadres who cannot leave their work to study full-time, correspondence education has even greater significance today. Correspondence education has a history of more than 20 years in the Soviet Union and has achieved significant results. The People's University of China has adopted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in this area. Under the guidance of many experienced Soviet experts, it began piloting correspondence courses for on-the-job cadres in February of this year.

    The purpose of correspondence education is to cultivate and improve the political and ideological level and professional theoretical knowledge of on-the-job cadres. We are working under the educational policy of "integrating Soviet experience with Chinese conditions, and combining theory with practice," and adopting the method of "self-study as the main focus, supplemented by lectures and guidance."

    According to our school's current subjective conditions and objective needs, we have initially set up ten specialized courses: National Economic Planning, Industrial Economics, Finance, Banking, Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, Domestic Trade, Foreign Trade, Industrial Statistics, Trade Statistics, and Industrial Accounting. The study period is two years in total (divided into four semesters), which is one year longer than our school's specialized courses. Each semester is approximately seventeen to twenty weeks, with eighteen hours of study time per week. Self-study time accounts for 70 percent, and lecture and guidance time accounts for 30 percent. There is a homework check once a month, a final exam each semester, and a graduation exam after the completion of the course. Those who pass will be issued a certificate of completion. The school is only responsible for the cultivation and education of correspondence students, not for assigning their work or solving their further education problems.

    The curriculum plan for the correspondence courses is roughly the same as that of the specialized courses in our school. Based on the characteristics of correspondence education, the political theory courses have been slightly streamlined, while the professional theory courses have been enriched as much as possible. The course content and its order are as follows: in principle, there are only two courses per semester, first a political theory course, then a professional theory and technical course.

    In February of this year, pilot programs were launched in three cities: Beijing, Tianjin, and Taiyuan. 2,765 on-the-job cadres recommended by financial departments, enterprises, factories, and mines were enrolled to participate in correspondence study.

    In order to effectively organize and lead the correspondence teaching work, a Correspondence Department has been established under the leadership of the principal. It has two sections, namely the Academic Affairs Section and the Secretariat, which manage academic affairs and administrative affairs respectively. At the same time, correspondence study guidance stations have been established in the cities mentioned above where correspondence students are enrolled to specifically organize and lead the students' study, understand their learning situation, and supervise them to complete their study plans.

    The departments and teaching and research sections related to the correspondence classes have a Deputy Director of Correspondence Education. The Deputy Director of Correspondence Education of the department is responsible for leading the correspondence work of the affiliated teaching and research sections. The responsibilities of the Deputy Director of Correspondence Education of each teaching and research section are: to determine the teaching progress, allocate teachers, organize lectures and guidance, compile "Study Method Instructions" for each course, and designate reference materials, etc.

    In order to ensure the correspondence teaching work, cultivate students' learning habits, and prevent the phenomenon of self-flow in learning, all on-the-job cadres participating in correspondence study are organized into study classes and study groups. The study classes and groups of correspondence students are a grass-roots organization for learning, and an indispensable bridge for the school to connect with students. The school uses it to lead the students. Without affecting their studies, certain tasks are assigned to the class and group leaders to strengthen self-management. In addition, various systems and disciplines suitable for the characteristics of correspondence study have been formulated, such as study system, examination system, leave application procedures, suspension and withdrawal procedures, etc., requiring on-the-job cadres participating in correspondence study to consciously implement them, so that they can overcome the misconception that "correspondence study is not a regular school education" and establish a correct learning attitude.

    For the past six months, the majority of on-the-job cadres participating in correspondence study have been able to overcome various difficulties and adhere to the self-study according to the plan.

    The coursework for the first semester has been completed as planned, and a semester exam has been held for the "History of the Chinese Revolution" course. The average examination score for the three stations was 3.2, of which "Excellent" accounted for 8.4 percent, "Good" accounted for 24.3 percent, "Medium" accounted for 58.1 percent, and "Poor" accounted for 9.2 percent. Judging from the above results, the gains of on-the-job cadres in correspondence study are not small, but compared with the school's teaching requirements, there is still a considerable distance.

    At present, the school has not yet compiled good textbooks, and the "Study Method Instructions" are not well written; there is still a lack of experience in lecturing, guiding, and managing correspondence students. These aspects must be improved and enhanced in the future.

    From the correspondence education work in the past six months, we have realized that: correspondence students must have a certain cultural level and theoretical foundation, otherwise they will encounter many difficulties when studying the courses of university specialized courses. This time, we did not pay enough attention to this point when recruiting students, and the level of the students is extremely inconsistent, which has increased the burden on teachers and affected the students' learning effect (some students have therefore dropped out halfway).

    In the environment of decentralized learning, correspondence students are often affected by various aspects. Therefore, the departments where they work should strengthen their ideological leadership, inspire their enthusiasm for learning, and check and supervise their learning. Only in this way can correspondence students give full play to their high degree of consciousness and initiative, overcome difficulties, and develop learning habits.

    中国人民大学的函授专修班
    中国人民大学函授部
    为适应国家大规模经济建设的需要，解决广大在职干部不能脱离工作专事学习的困难，函授教育在今天就更具有重要的意义。函授教育在苏联已有二十多年的历史，业经取得重大成绩。中国人民大学接受了苏联在这方面的先进经验，在许多有实际经验的苏联专家指导下，在今年二月间开始试办在职干部教育函授专修班。
    函授教育的目的是培养与提高在职干部的政治思想水平和业务理论知识。我们是在“苏联经验与中国情况相结合，理论与实践相结合”的教育方针下进行工作的，采取“以自学为主，辅之以讲授与辅导”的方式。
    按我校目前的主观条件和客观需要，先设国民经济计划、工业经济、财政、银行、供销与消费合作社、国内贸易、对外贸易、工业统计、贸易统计、工业会计等十个专修班。学习期限共两年（分四个学期），比我校专修科多一年。每学期约十七周到二十周，每周学习时间为十八小时。自学时间占百分之七十，讲授、辅导时数占百分之三十。每月进行一次作业检查，每学期有期考，修业期满后举行毕业考试，合格者发给修业证书。学校对函授生只负培养、教育的责任，不负责分配他们的工作，也不负责替他们解决升学问题。
    函授专修班的课程计划，大体上和本校专修科相同。根据函授教育的特点，对政治理论课稍进行了精简，而对业务理论课则力求加以充实。课程份量及其顺序为：每学期原则上只有两门课，先是政治理论课，后为业务理论和业务技术课。
    今年二月间在北京、天津、太原等三个城市开始进行了试办，招收了由财经部门、企业厂矿等组织保送的在职干部二千七百六十五人参加函授学习。
    为有效地组织和领导函授教学工作，在校长领导下设有函授部。下设教务、秘书两科，分别管理教务和行政事务工作。同时，在上述招收函授生的城市设立了函授学习辅导站，具体组织和领导函授生的学习，了解他们的学习情况，并督促他们完成学习计划。
    与函授各班有关的系、教研室，设函授教育副主任。系函授教育副主任负责领导所属教研室的函授工作。各教研室函授教育副主任的职责是：确定教学进度，配备教员，组织讲授和辅导，编写各课“学习方法指示”，指定参考资料等。
    为保证函授教学工作，培养学员的学习习惯，防止学习上的自流现象，凡参加函授学习的在职干部，均组成学习班和学习组。函授生的学习班、组，是一种学习方面的基层组织，是学校和学生联系时不可缺少的桥梁，学校通过它来对学员进行领导。在不影响其学习的原则下，给班、组长指定一定任务，以加强自我管理。另外，还制定了适合函授学习特点的各种制度和纪律，如学习制度、考试制度、请假办法、休、退学手续等，要求参加函授学习的在职干部都能自觉地执行，使他们克服“函授学习不是正规学校教育”的错误认识，树立正确的学习态度。
    半年来，参加函授学习的大多数在职干部，都能克服种种困难，坚持按计划进行自修。
    第一学期的课业已按计划完成，“中国革命史”课程举行了学期考试。三个站的平均考试成绩为三点二分，其中“优”占百分之八点四，“良”占百分之二十四点三，“中”占百分之五十八点一，“劣”占百分之九点二。从上述成绩看来，在职干部在函授学习中的收获是不小的，但和学校的教学要求比较起来，尚有相当距离。
    目前，学校还没有编写出好的教材，“学习方法指示”也编写得不够好；在讲授、辅导和对函授生的管理方面，还缺乏经验。今后在这些方面都要加以改善和提高。
    从半年来的函授教育工作中，我们认识到：函授生必须具备一定的文化水平和理论基础，否则在学习大学专修科的课程时会遇到不少的困难。这次招生，因对这一点注意得不够，学员的水平极不一致，这就加重了教师的负担，影响了学员的学习效果（一部分学员曾因而中途退学）。
    函授生在分散学习的环境下，常常会受到各方面的影响，因此，所在机关要对他们加强思想领导，启发他们的学习热情，检查和督促他们的学习。这样才能使函授生充分发挥高度的自觉性和积极性，克服困难，养成学习习惯。
