    In Memory of the Chinese Friend, German Writer Friedrich Wolf
    Xiāo Sān
    The famous playwright and novelist of the German Democratic Republic, Friedrich Wolf, passed away on October 5th of this year. This sad news caused me endless mourning.
    I remember, in the years when Hitler seized power, many progressive German writers went to the Soviet Union for refuge. One day, I received a call from Wolf, asking me to talk. I had seen his play "Sailors of Cattaro," translated by the famous Soviet playwright Vishnevsky, performed at a theater in Moscow, and I admired his plays. When we met, I saw that he was energetic, simple and sincere, an anti-fascist fighter, and a good comrade. He told me that he had written a play about the Chinese revolution, and it had been staged in Germany, titled "The Sun Awakens." It was about the Shanghai workers' revolutionary movement during the Chinese revolutionary war of 1925-1927. I was deeply moved by Wolf's passionate internationalism at that time. From then on, we had more and more contact, and I knew that his creative activities were constant and unremitting.
    In 1937, the film "Professor Mamlock" was shown in the Soviet Union and was very popular with audiences. I learned that this was originally an anti-fascist play written by Wolf, which had been performed in Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Warsaw, New York, London, Shanghai, Tokyo and other places. This play and film played a great role in the world's anti-Hitler fascist movement.
    One late autumn evening, I went to see Wolf off—he was leaving for Spain to participate in the anti-fascist war in Spain. But he did not make it. He was stopped at the French border and sent to a concentration camp. He suffered hardship and torture before he was able to return to the Soviet Union, and immediately joined the Soviet Union's Great Patriotic War against Hitler's Germany.
    In Yan'an in 1940 and 1941, I successively translated two of Wolf's plays: "Professor Mamen" (i.e., "Professor Mamlock") and "The New Trojan Horse." The former was performed by the students of the Yan'an Marxist-Leninist Academy, and Comrade Wang Dahua, who played Professor Mamen, showed his brilliant artistic talent in this play. The latter was performed by the Yan'an Cultural Club amateur theater troupe, and Director Chen Boer showed her spirit of hard work and outstanding artistic accomplishment. Unfortunately, both Comrade Wang Dahua and Comrade Chen Boer have also passed away.
    More than ten years after I parted with Wolf, we met again in Warsaw in the winter of 1950. At that time, we were there to attend the Second World Peace Congress, and Wolf was the first ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to the People's Republic of Poland. But he still did not forget and worked tirelessly in his creative career. At that time, the Warsaw Theater was staging his "The Sun Awakens." He accompanied us to see it. During the intermission, he led us backstage, introduced us to the famous actors who played the main roles, and talked with us. We saw that his script had been revised. Especially the last scene, when the Shanghai workers' masses appeared armed, the singing shook the sky, and a portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong was hanging high on the wall of the factory, the scene was very enthusiastic and won a lot of applause. We embraced in the box. I congratulated him on his success and thanked him and the Polish theater community for their love and sympathy for the Chinese people.
    After that, during the Third World Youth and Students Peace Festival in Berlin in 1951 and the special meeting of the World Peace Council in Berlin in 1952, I had the opportunity to meet and talk with Wolf and visit his home. He wrote new prefaces for the Chinese translations of "Professor Mamen" and "The New Trojan Horse." His creative desire was truly vigorous! He was writing plays and novels. The majority of the novel "Warning" (also known as "Flying Butterfly") was completed (Russian translation published in the "Banner" magazine). The historical play "Thomas Münzer" was in progress. He went to Dresden, to Leipzig, to see the premiere of his play, or to help rehearse, while revising his own script. He helped and encouraged the creation of young writers, and sometimes collaborated with young writers. Not long ago, the script of "Thomas Münzer" was completed. It is no exaggeration to say that Wolf was a prolific writer.
    Now this writer—soldier Friedrich Wolf, who, although having reached the age of sixty-five, looked very young and strong—has passed away. I, like all those who love him, mourn him and grieve for him. His literary works and his fighting spirit will always be loved and admired. In order to commemorate him, I will re-edit the two plays I translated so that they can be republished as soon as possible to serve our broad readership and audience, if they can be restaged—and that is very worthwhile.

    悼念中国的友人德国名作家弗·沃尔夫
    萧三
    德意志民主共和国名剧作家和小说家弗雷德里希·沃尔夫于今年十月五日逝世了。这一噩耗引起我无限的悼念。
    记得，那是在希特勒攫取了政权的年代，许多进步的德国作家们到了苏联避难。一天，我接了沃尔夫来的电话，约我谈谈。我看过他写的、由苏联名剧作家危史厄夫斯基翻译的“卡塔罗的水兵”在莫斯科某戏院的演出，对他的剧作是钦佩的。见面时，只见他精神焕发，朴素诚恳，是个反法西斯的战士，是一个好同志。他告诉我，他写过一个关于中国革命的剧本，并且在德国上演过，剧名“太阳觉醒了”。那是写一九二五—一九二七年中国革命战争时上海工人革命运动的。我当时为沃尔夫这种热情的国际主义所深深地感动。从此以后，我们来往过从的次数多了，知道他的创作活动是不断不懈的。
    一九三七年在苏联放映了“马姆洛克教授”的电影片子，大受观众欢迎。问知这原是沃尔夫写的一个反法西斯的剧本，在瑞士、挪威、瑞典、华沙、纽约、伦敦、上海、东京等地都曾演出过。这个剧和影片在世界反希特勒法西斯主义的运动中起了很大的作用。
    一个深秋的晚上，我去给沃尔夫送行——为了参加西班牙的反法西斯战争，他动身到西班牙去。但他没有去成，在法国的边境上被阻，被送入集中营。他受尽了艰苦折磨，好容易才又回到了苏联，立即又参加苏联反希特勒德国的伟大卫国战争。
    一九四○年、一九四一年在延安，我曾连续翻译了沃尔夫的两个剧本：“马门教授”（即“马姆洛克教授”）和“新木马计”。前者由延安马列学院的同学们演出，饰马门教授的王大化同志在这剧里显露了他的辉煌的艺术才能。后者由延安文化俱乐部业余剧团演出，导演陈波儿同志表现了她不畏艰苦的工作精神和卓越的艺术修养。不幸，王大化同志和陈波儿同志也都先后去世了。
    和沃尔夫离别十多年之后，一九五○年冬我们在华沙又得见面。那时我们在那里参加第二届世界保卫和平大会，沃尔夫是德意志民主共和国驻波兰人民共和国的首任大使。但他还是念念不忘和孜孜不倦地从事于他的创作事业。那时华沙戏院正在上演他的“太阳觉醒了”。他陪同我们去看。在休息时他引我们到后台，介绍和演主角的名演员认识，谈谈。我们看出，他的这个剧本已有了修改。特别是末一幕，上海工人群众武装出场，歌声震天，工场里墙上高处挂着毛泽东主席的肖像，场面非常热烈，博得不少的掌声。在包厢里我们拥抱了。我庆祝他的成功，感谢他和波兰戏剧界对中国人民的热爱和同情。
    之后，一九五一年在柏林举行第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节时，一九五二年在柏林举行世界和平理事会特别会议时，我和沃尔夫都得到见面畅谈的机会，并到过他的住宅。他为“马门教授”和“新木马计”的中译本写了新的序言。他的创作欲真是旺盛极了！他在写剧本，又在写小说。大部的小说“警告”（又名“飞蝶”）完成了（俄译发表在“旗帜”杂志上）。历史剧本“托马斯·门策尔”正在创作。他到德累斯顿去，到莱比锡去，为了看他的剧的首次公演；或帮助排演，一面修改自己的剧本。他帮助、鼓励青年作家的创作，有时就跟青年作家合作。不久以前，“托马斯·门策尔”剧本又完成了。可以毫不夸张地说，沃尔夫是一个多产的作家。
    现在这个年龄虽已到了六十五岁但看去还很年轻健壮的作家——战士弗雷德里希·沃尔夫去世了，我，和所有爱他的人们一样，哭他，哀悼他。他的文学著作，他的战斗精神，将永远被人热爱，受人景仰。为了纪念他，笔者当重校所译他的两个剧本，使其能从速再版，以饷我国广大的读者群，和观众，假如能重新排演的话，——而那是很值得的。（附图片）
