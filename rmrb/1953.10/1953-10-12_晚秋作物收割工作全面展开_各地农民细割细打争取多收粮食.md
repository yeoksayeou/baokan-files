    Late Autumn Crop Harvesting Work Fully Unfolded
    Farmers Everywhere Carefully Harvest and Thresh to Strive for More Grain
    [Our Newspaper's News] The harvesting of late autumn crops has fully unfolded across the country. Leadership organs and cadres at all levels are implementing the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, leading the broad masses, and employing various methods to strive to increase grain harvest.
    Many regions' leadership organs have set up targets for increasing grain production based on regional characteristics. According to calculations by the Agricultural Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee, if the Northeast can harvest in a timely manner, avoid various unexpected disasters, and carefully harvest and thresh, the loss of grain per hectare can be reduced by seventy or eighty jin. The autumn crops in the entire region can harvest an additional ten billion jin of grain. After research, Rehe Province proposed a goal of increasing production by five jin of grain per mu. Heilongjiang Province proposed increasing production by two dou of grain per hectare. After on-the-spot investigation, Jian'ou County in Fujian Province believes that if the entire county can carefully harvest and thresh, it can harvest an additional 13 million jin of grain.
    In order to specifically lead the movement to increase production and practice economy in rural areas, cadres from several large administrative regions and provinces have gone to the countryside to help with the work. The vast number of county, district, and township cadres are focusing on going deep into agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to help farmers improve harvesting methods, calculate meticulously, and break the thinking of some farmers who believe that "the autumn harvest is a foregone conclusion and cannot be increased." Farmers everywhere are generally paying attention to harvesting and gleaning thoroughly during the autumn harvest, and adopting various methods to improve crop harvest.
    The newly established agricultural production cooperative in Hongqiangzi Village, Yixian County, Liaoxi Province, is seething with an autumn harvest increase production and economy upsurge of "every grain returning home." This year's autumn harvest of the newly established agricultural production cooperative is completely different from previous years. In the past, people never considered whether it was better to harvest soybeans in the morning or afternoon; when harvesting, they would grab a large handful of soybean plants with a sickle, not caring about pods dropping, grains shattering, or branches falling. This year, the members researched that soybeans are not prone to shattering when the pods are damp, so they harvest in the morning when the dew has not dried; before using the knife, everyone accurately grabs two or three plants, bends over deeply, lays the knife flat, and cuts it close to the root, then gently puts it down; when encountering a fallen branch, they immediately pick it up and put it in a pile. Therefore, in the harvested fields, it is easy not to see a lost soybean branch or pod. When transporting the harvested crops back, in order to prevent soybean grains from shattering and falling during loading, the members spread burlap sacks under the cart to catch them; there were also people following behind the cart to pick up possible lost soybean plants or pods; the soybean plants were transported to the threshing floor and immediately spread out for threshing. In this way, all waste and losses in the past harvesting, transportation, and threshing processes are avoided, achieving "every grain returning home."
    Soybeans are being harvested everywhere in the Er District of Huachuan County, Songjiang Province. Yang Yuchun, secretary of the Er District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, found in the fields of the Mingxing Agricultural Production Cooperative that in a distance of two bows, there were eighty-nine soybean grains left on twenty-two of the forty-seven soybean stubbles. If the cooperative's forty hectares of soybeans were all like this, more than 9,000 jin of grain would be lost. However, the Zhao Haitao mutual aid team, which he personally led, only lost two soybean grains in each bow's worth of stubble because it improved harvesting techniques. Yang Yuchun used this fact to educate the village cadres in the entire district, driving the farmers in the entire district to carefully harvest and thresh, and harvest in a timely manner.
    In order to avoid accidental losses to mature autumn crops, many counties in Shanxi Province have carried out "crop lineups," separating the order of harvesting according to the degree of maturity of the autumn crops. The mutual aid team in Shijiazha Village, Datong County, not only resolved the internal contradictions of the team due to the "crop lineup," but also truly achieved quick harvesting and clean cutting, ensuring that no ear was lost. The Li Shunda Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingshun County proposed three cleans: threshing ground, field, and road. The amount harvested matched what was grown which reduced grain losses by about 1,000 jin compared to last year. Yuci, Changzhi, and three other special districts in the province have generally mobilized farmers to hunt mountain pests and prepare for frost prevention to avoid grain losses. According to statistics from Huguan and Lingchuan counties alone, farmers captured more than 36,000 wild animals of various kinds that harmed crops and more than 20,000 harmful birds during the autumn harvest. The Yuci Prefectural Commissioner's Office sent a work team deep into the fields to study methods for harvesting millet, sorghum, corn, and other crops. They found that when harvesting millet, cutting it from the root without taking care of the millet ears would cause the unevenly sized millet ears to be lost in the waist of the millet grass. When harvesting sorghum and corn, cutting the stalks before the ears would also cause a large amount of grain to be lost. They helped Zhao Jiehu and five other households in Dongyang Village, Yuci to make specific calculations and estimated that the entire village would lose more than 26,000 jin of grain in the autumn harvest as a result of this. If this money were used to buy foreign cloth, each farm household in the village could receive more than two zhang of cloth. After calculating carefully, they promoted the widespread improvement of harvesting techniques among the farmers in the entire village.
    In Shangqiu City Suburbs, Henan Province, the mutual aid teams of Dachenzhuang Township are harvesting soybeans in the fields at night when the weather is dry, loading the carts in the morning when there is dew, and organizing elderly women and children to pick up soybean grains in the fields, reducing the phenomenon of soybean pods bursting and grains falling off. The 1,700 mu of soybeans in the entire township have an average reduction in loss of five or six jin per mu, for a total increase of 8,500 jin of soybeans. Beiguanzhuang Township, Jiyuan County, organized children to pick up the missed ears of millet and corn cobs in the fields, increasing grain by more than 8,700 jin, which can feed 219 people for a month. Regarding wheat planting, the Zhao Heizhi Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Zhengzhou City plans to expand the wheat field from 140 mu last year to 180 mu, and pay attention to watering, preserving moisture, sowing in a timely manner, and implementing dense planting, striving to increase production by 15% next year on the basis of this year's bumper harvest. In order to ensure that the wheat planting area is not reduced and to strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year, the farmers in Gaofeng'an Township, Nanzhao County, actively renovated more than 200 mu of land that was damaged by rain this summer, achieving timely sowing. The farmers in Longtai Village, Qinyang County, came up with drought-resistant and moisture-preserving methods such as deep plowing and fine harrowing, and breaking up soil clods, so that more than 90% of the wheat fields in the entire village were sown in a timely manner.
    Farmers in the Seventh District of Minhou County, Fujian Province, actively responded to the state's call to increase production and conserve grain. At the end of September, they held a meeting of more than 100 people, including all mutual aid team leaders and representatives of individual farmers from nine townships in the rice-producing area, to discuss ways to increase the harvest of late rice and reduce losses. The late rice in the Seventh District of Minhou County is about to mature, but it has recently been discovered that hedgehogs, pheasants, field mice, and other animals are ruining crops, and some fields are also infested with rice borers. After criticizing the old view that "when the fields are ripe, there is no need to worry about birds," the meeting decided to launch a campaign to eliminate animals and insects. Some townships have decided to form hunting teams. The area also has sayings such as "fields near the village, half the harvest" and "fields by the road, the harvest is not complete," saying that rice near residences is easily eaten by livestock and poultry, and rice by the road is easily knocked off grains by picked firewood branches, and this loss is unavoidable. In response to these situations, the meeting proposed some effective methods to prevent losses. In addition, the meeting also specifically discussed how to prevent grain loss during the harvesting process. According to the attendees, in the past, from harvesting, threshing, transporting to drying and storing, one mu of rice would lose a total of about 20 jin of grain. If this loss can be avoided or reduced this year, the 40,000 mu of late rice in the entire district can increase rice production by 700,000 to 800,000 jin. This loss during the harvesting process has always been wrongly considered "insignificant." After this meeting, many people established the concept of saving by "accumulating small amounts to make a large amount."
    In addition, farmers everywhere this year have paid attention to making harvesting preparations in advance, mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives have implemented a reasonable division of labor and contracting, preventing livestock from ruining grain, and preventing losses during drying and storing grain, which have all played a significant role in increasing grain harvest. Many state-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and farmers in various places have formulated plans to increase production and practice economy under the education of typical examples.
    However, during the autumn harvest, some areas have not sufficiently promoted the significance of increasing production and practicing economy, and the understanding of some cadres and the masses is still very vague. For example, some cadres in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, simply asked farmers to save money, ignoring the mobilization of the masses to increase crop harvest. Some cadres and agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams put their attention on engaging in sideline income, and do not actively harvest and salvage the crops that have already matured in the fields and the crops affected by floods, hindering the autumn harvest work. Some cadres do not go deep into the masses to solve specific problems for them. The masses did not take active actions after listening to the cadres' speeches, so that the autumn harvest preparation work became a mere formality, affecting the progress of the autumn harvest work. Some cadres in Huangping, Fenggang, and Suiyang counties in Guizhou Province only held meetings to arrange work and were perfunctory to their superiors. When reporting to their superiors, they said that the autumn harvest preparation work of farmers in various places was well done, but in reality, many farmers lacked agricultural tools and animal power. Some places only paid attention to helping agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, while ignoring individual farmers and failing to help them solve their difficulties in the autumn harvest. In addition, some areas have not done a good job in supplying farmers with means of production, and some areas have frequent visits from work teams from various departments. They do not actually help farmers to do a good job in the autumn harvest, but instead call cadres to meetings every day and do their own thing, affecting the farmers' harvesting work. The above phenomena must be quickly improved and prevented in order to further mobilize the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, avoid losses in the autumn harvest, and strive to harvest more grain.

    晚秋作物收割工作全面展开
    各地农民细割细打争取多收粮食
    【本报讯】各地晚秋作物的收割工作已经全面展开。各级领导机关和干部贯彻增产节约的精神，带领广大群众，运用各种办法，争取增加粮食的收获量。
    许多地区的领导机关根据地区特点订出了增产粮食的奋斗目标。据东北行政委员会农业局计算，东北各地如能收割及时，避免各种意外灾害，细收细打，每垧地就可减少七、八十斤粮食的损失，全区秋季作物可多收粮食十亿斤。热河省经过研究后，提出每亩地多收五斤粮的奋斗目标。黑龙江省提出每垧地多收二斗粮食。福建省建瓯县经过实地考察，认为全县如能细收细打，可多收一千三百万斤粮食。
    为了具体领导农村增产节约运动，若干大行政区和省的干部已下乡帮助工作。广大县区乡干部更有重点地深入农业生产合作社和互助组，帮助农民改进收割方法，算细账，打破了某些农民认为“秋收已成定局，无法增产”的思想。各地农民在秋收中普遍注意收好割净，采取各种办法提高了作物的收获量。
    辽西省义县红墙子村新建农业生产合作社，正沸腾着“颗粒还家”的秋收增产节约热潮。新建农业生产合作社今年秋收全部过程都和往年大不相同。往年，人们收割大豆从不考虑午前割好，还是午后割好；割时用镰刀把豆棵揽过一大把，掉荚、炸粒和倒枝，谁也不去管它。今年，社员们研究出在豆荚潮时割不易炸粒，就都在露水未干的午前割；动刀前，大家准确地抓住两三棵，深深地弯下腰，放平刀，贴根割下，然后轻轻放好；遇见倒枝随即拣起放在堆里。因此，在割过的地里，轻易看不到一个丢失的豆枝或豆荚。割好往回运的时候，社员们为了防止装车时炸丢豆粒，在车下铺上麻袋接着；车后还有人跟随拣拾可能丢失的豆株或豆荚；豆株运到打谷场上，紧接着就铺场打。这样，就避免了以往收割、运输、打场过程中的一切浪费损失，做到“颗粒还家”。
    松江省桦川县二区大豆普遍收割。中共二区区委书记杨玉春在明星农业生产合作社的地里，发现两弓远的地方，四十七棵豆槎中就有二十二棵上留有八十九个豆粒，如果该社四十垧大豆都是这样，就会损失九千多斤粮食。而他亲自领导的赵海涛互助组，因为改进了收割技术，每弓远的豆槎中只损失两粒豆子。杨玉春用这一事实教育全区村干部，带动了全区农民细收细打，及时收割。
    山西省不少县份为避免成熟秋禾遭受意外损失，都进行了“庄稼站队”，按秋禾成熟程度分出收割先后。大同县石家砦村互助组由于做好了“庄稼站队”，不但使组内争活的矛盾得到解决，而且真正做到了收快割净，保证了一穗不丢。平顺县李顺达农业生产合作社在秋收中提出场、地、道三净，几成庄稼几成收后，约比去年减少粮食损失一千斤左右。该省榆次、长治等五个专区，普遍发动农民捕打山害和准备防霜，避免粮食损失。仅据壶关、陵川两县统计，秋收中农民捕打了各种为害庄稼的野兽三万六千多只，害鸟二万多头。榆次专署派工作组深入田间，研究收了割谷子、高粱、玉米等的方法，发现割谷时，从根上割而不注意照顾谷穗，会使长短不齐的谷穗夹在谷草腰间而丢失粮食；割高粱、玉米时先割秆后割穗，也会大量丢失粮食。他们帮助榆次东阳村赵杰货等五户作了具体的计算，并估计全村在秋收中要因此丢失粮食二万六千多斤，如用这笔钱买洋布，全村农户每户能分到两丈多布。经过算细账，推动全村农民普遍地改进了收割技术。
    河南省商邱市郊大陈庄乡各互助组在天气干旱的情况下，都在夜间下地收割大豆，早晨有露水时装车，并组织老年妇女和儿童下地拾豆粒，减少了大豆炸角脱粒现象。全乡一千七百多亩大豆平均每亩减少损耗五、六斤，共多收豆子八千五百斤。济源县北官庄乡组织儿童下地拾回漏掉的谷穗和玉米棒子，增加粮食八千七百多斤，可供二百一十九人吃一个月。在种麦方面，郑州市郊区赵黑字农业生产合作社计划要把麦田从去年的一百四十亩扩大到一百八十亩，并注意浇水、保墒，适时下种，实行密植，争取在今年丰收的基础上，明年增产一成半。南召县高峰庵乡农民为了保证不缩小种麦面积，争取明年小麦丰收，便积极整修今夏被雨水冲毁的二百多亩土地，做到了及时下种。沁阳县龙台村农民想出深耕细耙、打碎坷垃等抗旱保墒办法，使全村百分之九十以上的麦田适时下种。
    福建省闽侯县第七区农民积极响应国家增产节约粮食的号召，在九月底举行了水稻产区九个乡的全体互助组组长、单干农民代表等一百多人的会议，讨论提高晚稻收获量、减少损失的办法。闽侯县第七区晚稻即将成熟，但最近发现有刺猬、山鸡、田鼠等糟蹋庄稼，一部分田里又有螟虫为害。会议在批判了那种“田园大熟，何愁鸟雀”的陈旧观点以后，决定开展除兽除虫工作，有些乡已决定成立打猎队。该区还流传所谓“村边田、对半收”、“路边田、收不全”的俗语，说是靠近住宅的水稻易被家畜家禽吃掉，路旁的水稻易被挑过的柴枝等碰脱谷粒，这种损失无可避免。会议又针对这些情况，提出了一些有效的防止损失的办法。此外，会议还特别讨论了如何防止收获过程中损失谷子。据到会者说，过去一亩水稻从收割、打谷、搬运到晒存，总共要损失谷子二十斤左右，假若今年能设法避免或减少这种损失，全区四万亩晚稻就可增产谷子七八十万斤。这种收获过程中的损失，过去一贯被人错误地认为“微不足道”。经过这次会议，很多人树立了“积少成多”的节约观念。
    此外，各地农民今年在秋收中都注意了预先作好了收割准备，互助组、农业生产合作社实行了合理分工和包工，防止牲畜糟蹋粮食，防止晒粮、藏粮时的损失，对增加粮食收获量都起了很大作用。各地许多国营农场、农业生产合作社、互助组和农民，在典型事例的教育下，都已订出了增产节约计划。
    但是，在秋收中，有些地区对增产节约的意义还宣传得不够，有些干部和群众认识还很模糊。如黑龙江省克山县有些干部单纯要求农民节约，忽略发动群众增加农作物收获量。有的干部和农业生产合作社、互助组，把注意力放在搞副业收入方面，对地里已经成熟的庄稼和受水灾的庄稼，不积极进行收割和打捞，妨碍了秋收工作。有些干部不深入到群众中去，为群众解决具体问题，群众听了干部的讲话后也没有积极行动，以致秋收准备工作流于形式，影响到秋收工作的进展。贵州黄平、凤冈、绥阳等县的部分干部，只是开会布置工作，对上敷衍，在向上级汇报时说各地农民秋收准备工作做得好，而实际上却有许多农民缺乏农具和畜力。有的地方只注意帮助农业生产合作社和互助组，而忽略了个体农民，没有帮助他们解决秋收中的困难。此外，有的地区对农民生产资料的供应工作做得不好，有的地区各部门工作组来往频繁，他们不实际帮助农民搞好秋收，却天天召集干部开会，搞自己的一套，影响了农民的收割工作。以上现象，都必须迅速改进和防止，以进一步发挥干部和群众积极性，避免秋收中的损失，力争多收粮食。
