Learning From Scratch
    ——How Communist Party Member Di Shigong Learned to Manage the Forest Industry
    By Our Correspondent Chen Yongjin
    While the workers in the Songhua River Basin forest area are busily transporting timber, I visited Comrade Di Shigong, Director of the Jiamusi Forest Industry Bureau – a demobilized soldier who, from complete ignorance of the forest industry, has learned through arduous study to manage it very well.
    When the Fourth Field Army completed its historical mission of liberating Northeast China and was ordered to enter the customs, Di Shigong, an excellent soldier and Communist Party member of a certain division, was suffering from severe lung disease. When Di Shigong learned that the troops were going to enter the customs, he asked the division political commissar to allow him to stay in the army and follow the troops. The division political commissar knew that Di Shigong was no longer fit to work in the army, so he advised him to transfer to civilian work and recuperate.
    For a Communist Party member, a soldier who had grown up in battle, it was indeed very painful to have to leave the army when his troops were about to undertake even more serious combat missions. Di Shigong repeatedly ran to the troops to request approval for him to continue working in the army; when he ran to the troops for the sixth time, the division headquarters had to issue an order for him to transfer to civilian work with regret. At this time, he had to go to another place that needed him, to work in the great forest, leaning on crutches and with his weak body.

    Opening the Door to the Secrets of the Forest Industry
    A good leader does not lie in his inherent mastery of the work entrusted to him by the Party and the people, but in his ability to study and delve into it diligently, and do his job well. This is especially true for Communist Party members. From the first day he was assigned to the Hulonggou Sub-bureau of the Songjiang Provincial Forest Industry Bureau as the sub-bureau chief, Di Shigong was determined to learn and master this forest enterprise.
    Even before Di Shigong arrived at Hulonggou, the urgent production tasks had already been issued. The higher leading organs gave the Hulonggou Sub-bureau the urgent task of producing 100,000 railway sleepers. The sub-bureau had already contracted out the 100,000 railway sleepers to a private logging company, and everything was arranged, waiting only for the sub-bureau chief to sign. For Di Shigong, such an urgent production task, such a huge amount of property, requiring him to be responsible for signing a contract with a private logging company, was a very heavy responsibility. At that time, he could not eat or sleep well. Before signing, Di Shigong repeatedly held meetings with the technical personnel to study and inquire about all aspects of the situation until he had a solid grasp, and then he wrote his name on the contract.
    Di Shigong was determined to truly understand his forest, and knew that only in this way could he complete the serious task given by the state. So Di Shigong went to the great forest for the first time to survey it. In September, the forest area still often had rain. The investigators in the forest not only could not eat hot food, but also had to sleep in the damp wilderness at night, and hungry mosquitoes attacked them from time to time... For Di Shigong, who was suffering from severe lung and stomach diseases and had to rely on crutches to walk, it was undoubtedly very difficult. However, none of this frightened this young Communist Party member.
    Everything in the forest was unfamiliar and new to Di Shigong. When he saw so many trees, he excitedly said to the technical personnel: We must be able to complete our task. Look, these can all be felled! The technician asked him which trees could be felled, and he pointed out several tall trees. The technician told him, "This is a poplar, that is an elm, neither can be used as railway sleepers." He pointed out several red pines again, and the technician told him that there was "mushroom" on this tree, and there were holes in that tree, and they were all rotten inside and could not be felled either. They sawed down the trees to study the wood quality and growth conditions. Di Shigong greedily inquired about everything: What is this, what is that, what is this kind of tree suitable for, what is the use of that kind of tree, and how do they grow... He wanted to ask everything to the bottom. After this survey, Di Shigong knew why red pines grew on shady hillsides, why yellow pines grew on meadows... and how they grew up. The door to the secrets of the forest industry was opened by him. He also had a better understanding of whether the current task could be completed.

    Going to the Masses to Discover Problems
    The continuous rain in July this year brought worries and anxieties to the people on both sides of the Songhua River. The Lianjiangkou timber yard on the opposite bank of Jiamusi stored a large amount of timber. If the river water rose again, the timber would be washed away. The higher authorities ordered another responsible cadre and Di Shigong to jointly take charge of rushing the timber here. The timber rushing headquarters was located in a small wooden house on the bank of the Songhua River. However, it was difficult to find Di Shigong in the headquarters. Di Shigong spent all day walking around the site, regardless of the heavy rain or the hot sun, he could not be made to return to the room unless he himself thought it was necessary. Initially, the rush work was divided into day and night shifts. Di Shigong worked day and night. At that time, many lower-level cadres were busy running around from here to there, but there was no one responsible on the site, and some workers could not even find work to do. After Di Shigong discovered this situation, he immediately called on the cadres to study how to divide responsibilities to carry out the work.
    Although Di Shigong did not spend a long time in this timber yard, he was good at learning, so he knew exactly how long the railway line in this timber yard was, how many freight cars it could hold, how many freight cars the workers could load in an hour, and how the trains should be scheduled.
    The completion of a task depends on the efforts of the vast number of cadres and the masses. Di Shigong understood this, he went deep into the masses, discovered problems, and solved problems. Di Shigong also often went to the places that people paid the least attention to. In the timber yard, from the iron stamps that the scalers put on the timber, he discovered the unreasonable phenomenon of scaling: many scalers designated first-class timber as second-class, or second-class as third-class, and third-class as substandard. He immediately took out the timber specification table to prove a scaler's mistake. He gathered many scalers to jointly check and verify the errors, and at the same time convened a meeting of all scalers to educate them. At the meeting, he told everyone: "A slight negligence on our part will cause the state's property to suffer losses. If this iron stamp is stamped incorrectly, many good timbers will become waste products. If we continue to scale like this, we will cause losses of more than one billion yuan."

    Uniting Technical Personnel Around Oneself
    In the Jiamusi forest area, no one calls Di Shigong an expert, but everyone knows that Di Shigong can propose practical and feasible methods in logging, transport, forest railways and other businesses. The reason why Di Shigong is able to do this is largely due to his ability to unite technical personnel.
    Technical personnel are very willing to work with Di Shigong. In 1951, the Songjiang Administration arranged summer logging work, and the task was urgent. In order to understand the situation in the Baoshan forest area, Di Shigong was about to go to survey it again. At this time, it was during the Spring Festival, and according to Di Shigong's leg condition at the time, it was indeed not suitable to go to the deep mountains again. However, he was going to survey it again. He encouraged the technical personnel, saying: The Spring Festival should be a time for rest, but the country's tasks cannot wait for us any longer. It is even more interesting to go hunting in the mountains during the Spring Festival. Seeing that Di Shigong's body was so weak but he was so enthusiastic about his work, everyone felt the glory and joy of working during the festival, and happily set off with him. And Di Shigong learned a lot of things in this survey.
    When building the forest railway in the Huanan forest area, the route measured by the technical personnel had to pass through a section of grassland. In this area full of mud and water, they encountered even greater difficulties. Di Shigong immediately went to the mountains to re-select the route, and then discussed with the technical personnel how to change the route. During the discussion, Di Shigong put forward the reasons for choosing the new route, which made the technical personnel responsible for measuring the old route realize their mistakes, and automatically reviewed their mistakes at the meeting for only knowing how to mechanically adhere to the regulations and not proceeding from reality, and asked the leadership to give him punishment.

    Overcoming Difficulties and Moving Forward
    Victory belongs to those who dare to face difficulties.
    Arduous and urgent tasks followed one after another. Di Shigong often completed one task and immediately plunged into a new battle without even a short rest.
    In September, timber production in the forest area should be when everything is fully prepared. However, in September 1951, they had just received the task of felling and transporting 100,000 cubic meters of timber, and a large number of people had to go to the mountains immediately. Work began, and although the workers worked day and night, the efficiency was very low. Time was already late, and if the efficiency was low, how could the task be completed? In the snowstorm, he was with the workers, quietly observing and looking for the reasons for the low efficiency. The key was finally found by him. It turned out that the workers did not know the quota for the work, so their enthusiasm for work was not high. He immediately told the masses the truth, and the enthusiasm of the masses rose.
    As soon as the above task was completed, Di Shigong received the task of dismantling the railway line in the Hegang forest area, and had to rush to transport 100,000 cubic meters of timber in a very short time. The timber was stored very scattered, and time was so tight. His lung and stomach diseases were severe at this time. Sometimes he could not eat anything for one or two days. Even so, Di Shigong was still with the workers from morning till night, studying how to load more and pull faster. When the day shift workers went to work, they saw him working with the night shift workers; the night shift workers saw him still on the site during the day. This young man became thinner, and sometimes even coughed up blood, but he did not pay attention to it. He was just trying his best to complete the task assigned to him by the Party.
    When the Hegang rush transport task was nearing completion, Di Shigong, ignoring the torment of his illness, and without waiting for the ice and snow to melt, took people to survey the Dahuanggou forest area again. Because he knew that the country's need for timber would continue to increase day by day. They were victorious. In a few days, they discovered a forest area with a reserve of three million cubic meters of timber.
    Now Di Shigong is not as thin as he was when he first came to the forest area, and his weight has increased by more than 20 kilograms. Lung disease, stomach disease, and leg disease have slowly improved. Di Shigong's strong will has overcome the disease.

    从头学起
    ——记共产党员狄世功如何学会管理森林工业
    本报记者  陈勇进
    正当松花江流域林区职工紧张流送木材的时候，我访问了佳木斯森林工业管理局局长狄世功同志——一个由完全不懂森林工业，经过艰苦不拔的学习而能很好管理森林工业的复员军人。
    当第四野战军完成了解放东北的历史使命，奉命进关的时候，某师的优秀战士、共产党员狄世功同志正患着严重的肺病。当狄世功知道部队要进关时，就要求师政治委员允许他留在部队里随军进关。师政治委员知道狄世功已不适合在部队工作了，因此劝他转业和休养。
    一个共产党员，一个在战斗中成长起来的战士，当自己的部队将要担负起更为严重的战斗任务，而要自己离开部队的时候，的确是非常痛苦的。狄世功一次又一次地跑到部队里请求批准他继续留在部队里工作；当他第六次跑到部队的时候，师部不得不惋惜地下了让他转业的命令。这时他只得扶着拐杖带着病弱的身子到另一个需要他的地方去了，到大森林里工作去了。
    打开了森林工业的秘密之门
    一个好的领导者，不在于他本来就精通党和人民委托给自己的工作，而在于他能够刻苦地学习、钻研，作好自己的工作。这对共产党员来说更是如此。狄世功从被派到松江省森林工业管理局的火龙沟分局做分局长的第一天起，就决心学会和掌握这个森林企业。
    狄世功还没有来到火龙沟时，火急的生产任务就已经下来了。上级领导机关给了火龙沟分局生产十万根枕木的紧急任务，分局已把十万根枕木承包给一家私营伐木公司，一切都安排妥当了，只等分局长签字。这样紧急的生产任务，这样巨大的财产，要自己负责和私营伐木公司签订合同，在狄世功来说，责任是十分重大的，当时他吃不下饭也睡不好觉。狄世功在签字之前，和技术人员反复开会研究，探询了各方面的情形，直到有了确实把握后，才在合同上写上了自己的名字。
    狄世功决心要真正了解自己的森林，也知道只有这样，才能完成国家所给予的严重任务。于是狄世功第一次到大森林里去踏查了。九月的林区还时常有雨，在森林里的调查人员不用说吃不到热的东西，夜晚还得在阴湿的野地里露宿，饥饿的蚊虫还时时向人进攻……对于患着严重的肺病和胃病、走路还得靠拐杖的狄世功无疑是十分困难的。但是，这一切都没有吓倒这位年青的共产党员。
    森林里的一切对狄世功都是生疏的新鲜的。当他看到这么多的树木，便兴奋地向技术人员说：咱们的任务一定能够完成，你看，这不都可以采伐呀！技术员问他那些树能采，他指出了几棵高大的树木。技术员告诉他，“这是杨树，那是榆树，都不能当枕木。”他又指出了几棵红松，技术员又告诉他，这棵树上有“蘑菇”，那棵树上有窟窿，里面都坏了，也不能采伐。他们锯倒了树木研究木质和生长的情况。狄世功贪婪地追问着一切：这是什么，那是什么，这种树适合作什么，那种树有什么用处，以及它们怎样生长……他都要寻根究底地问个清楚。经过这一次踏查，狄世功知道了红松为什么长在背阴的山坡上，黄花松为什么长在草甸子上……以及他们是怎样生长起来的。森林工业的秘密之门被他打开了。对于当前的任务能否完成心里也有了底。
    到群众中去发现问题
    今年七月的连绵阴雨，给松花江两岸的人民带来了忧虑和焦急。佳木斯对岸的莲江口贮木厂贮放着大量的木材。江水如果再上涨，就要把木材冲跑。上级命令另外一位负责干部和狄世功共同负责抢运这里的木材。抢运木材的指挥部设在松花江边的一个小木房里。但是，在指挥部里你是很难找到狄世功的。狄世功整天穿行在现场里，不论大雨或炎热的太阳，除非他自己认为需要，都不能使他回到房里去。最初，抢运工作分成昼夜两班。狄世功却是昼夜不分地干下去。那时不少下层干部忙乱地从这里忙到那里，现场上却出现了无人负责现象，甚至有的工人找不到工作做。狄世功发现了这种情况后，马上召集干部研究如何分段负责来进行工作。
    狄世功在这个贮木厂的时间虽然不长，但因他善于学习，所以连这个贮木场的铁路线有多长，能放多少车皮，工人一点钟能装多少车皮，火车应当如何调度，都知道得清清楚楚。
    一个任务的完成是靠广大干部和群众的努力得来的。狄世功懂得这一点，他深入群众，发现问题，解决问题。狄世功还经常到人们最不注意的地方去。在贮木场里，从检尺员打在木材上的铁印中，他发现了检尺的不合理现象：不少的检尺员把一等材定成二等材，或者把二等的定成三等，三等的定成等外材。他马上拿出木材规格表来证实一个检尺员的错误。他召集了很多检尺人员共同检查，对证错误，同时召集了全体检尺人员会议，对他们进行教育。在会上，他告诉大家：“我们稍有疏忽，就会使国家的财产受到损失。这一个铁印打错了，很多好木材就变成了废品。照这样检尺下去，我们就会造成十多亿元的损失。”
    把技术人员团结在自己的周围
    在佳木斯林区，并没有什么人把狄世功喊作专家，但是，有一点大家都知道：狄世功在采伐、流送、森林铁路等业务上，都能提出切实可行的办法。狄世功所以能够这样，与他能够团结技术人员有很大关系。
    技术人员很愿意和狄世功一块出去工作。一九五一年松江管理局布置了夏季采伐工作，任务是紧急的。为了了解宝山林区的情况，狄世功马上又要去踏查。这时正当春节，按照狄世功当时腿病的情况，也确实是不宜再到深山里去了。但是，他又要去踏查。他鼓励技术人员说：春节是应当休息，但是，国家的任务不等我们再拖下去，春节到山里去打个猎更有趣味。大家看到狄世功身体这样瘦弱对工作还这么热情，也都感到节日里劳动的光荣和愉快，高高兴兴地和他一起出发了。而狄世功在这次踏查中，又学习到了很多东西。
    在桦南林区修建森林铁路的时候，技术人员测量的线路要经过一段草地，在这满是泥水的地带，他们碰到了更大的困难。狄世功马上到山里去重新选择了线路，然后和技术人员们研究如何改线。在研究中，狄世功提出了选择新线路的理由，使负责测量旧线路的技术人员认识了自己的错误，自动地在会议上检讨自己只会死啃规章，不从实际出发的错误，并要求领导方面给他以处分。
    克服困难不断前进
    胜利属于那些敢于迎接困难的人们。
    艰巨的紧急的任务一个连着一个。狄世功常常是完成一件任务后，连短暂的休息都没有，立即又愉快地投入新的战斗。
    九月里，林区的木材生产应该是一切都准备妥当的时候了。但是，一九五一年的九月，他们却刚刚接到采伐、运输十万立方公尺木材的任务，大批人马要立即上山。作业开始了，虽然工人们昼夜工作，但是效率却很低。时间本来已经迟了，效率再低，任务怎么能够完成呢？暴风雪里，他和工人们在一起，静静地观察、寻找效率低的原因。关键终于被他找到了。原来是工人们不知道工作的定额，因而干活情绪不高。他马上向群众交了底，群众的情绪高涨起来。
    上述的任务刚完成，狄世功又接到了拆除鹤岗林区的铁路线，并且要在很短的时间内抢运十万立方公尺木材。木材贮放得非常分散，时间又那么紧迫。偏偏他的肺病和胃病在这时厉害了。有时一、两天不能吃一点饭。即令如此，狄世功仍然是一天到晚和工人们在一起，研究如何装得多拉得快。白班工人上班时看到他和夜班的工人在一起工作；夜班工人在白天看到他仍然在现场上。这个年轻人瘦下来了，有时还吐血，但也没有引起他的注意。他只是在想尽一切办法来完成党交给他的任务。
    当鹤岗抢运任务接近完成的时候，狄世功不顾疾病的折磨，不等冰雪化完，又带着人踏查大荒沟林区去了。因为，他知道国家对木材的需要还要日益增加。他们胜利了。他们在几天里发现了积蓄三百万立方公尺木材的林区。
    现在狄世功已不像他刚来林区时那样瘦弱了，体重已增加了二十多公斤。肺病、胃病、腿病都慢慢好了，狄世功的坚强的意志战胜了病魔。
