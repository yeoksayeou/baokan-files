    Hamblen Has Failed
    Gu Ping
    One of the world's biggest scams, a scam built on a foundation of bloody violence—the American so-called "unwillingness to repatriate" of captured Chinese and Korean personnel—has completely gone bankrupt. The executioners who manufactured this scam are in a panic. Since the transfer of non-directly repatriated prisoners of war from the Chinese and Korean side to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) for custody, American reactionaries have been anxiously resorting to all sorts of vile and shameless means in an attempt to obstruct and sabotage the explanation and interview work with the prisoners of war. To achieve this sinister goal, they have also been arrogantly attacking, insulting, threatening, and interfering with the NNRC, which was nominated, agreed upon, and invited by both sides.
    When the NNRC invited representatives from both sides to observe the handover of prisoners of war, the U.S. side and the American propaganda machine clamored in opposition; when the NNRC issued a public letter to the prisoners of war on September 26, guaranteeing that the prisoners of war could freely exercise their right to be repatriated, the U.S. side again wantonly slandered and defamed it; Hamblen, the head of the U.S. repatriation group, even openly lodged a "protest." The U.S. side became even more infuriated when the NNRC announced the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work."
    Why is it that in the eyes of the American aggressors, every move of the NNRC is unacceptable? This is because these fair measures of the NNRC are not conducive to the U.S.'s despicable plot to forcibly detain prisoners of war.
    For a long time, the United States has used brutal methods such as forced "screening," tattooing, heart-digging, belly-slitting, eye-gouging, etc., to force a large number of captured Chinese and Korean personnel to "refuse repatriation," and after sending a large number of special agents into the prisoner-of-war camps to exert control over the prisoners of war, the executioners once smugly thought that their sinister purpose of detaining prisoners of war could be completely achieved. Hamblen, the head of the U.S. repatriation group, shamelessly said: If the United States detains "15,000" captured soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, then "we (the United States) will have won our psychological warfare of this era." However, the executioners' "wishful thinking" was completely wrong, and the bloody hands of sin will ultimately not be able to stifle the prisoners of war's desire to return home to live a peaceful life. As soon as they were transferred to the custody of the NNRC, more than a hundred people broke through the control of the special agents and demanded repatriation. The entire set of plans and steps for the United States to detain prisoners of war has also been exposed to the people of the world one by one. Therefore, the American jackals, who were ashamed into anger, simply became shameless and simply took out the old capital of playing a dead dog. For example, they once claimed to be "abiding by the agreement," but they closed their eyes and opposed the NNRC's invitation to representatives from both sides to observe the work of receiving prisoners of war in accordance with the provisions of Article 1 of the "Terms of Reference." They constantly repeated the sentence "no violence shall be inflicted in any manner or for any purpose on the person of prisoners of war or insult to their dignity or self-respect," but they opposed the NNRC's measures to prohibit Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents from inflicting violence on prisoners of war in accordance with this provision, and insisted that prisoners of war have the right to "collectively" accept or refuse to accept explanations, so that Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents could continue to control and coerce prisoners of war. They even openly admitted: "Other prisoners of war (referring to Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents) have sworn to kill any prisoner of war who attends even one explanation meeting" (United Press International, September 19). They have repeatedly stated that they have informed all prisoners of war of the contents of the Armistice Agreement, but according to Lieutenant General Thimayya, the U.S. side deliberately concealed and distorted certain important provisions of the "Terms of Reference" agreement from the prisoners of war. They pay lip service to respecting neutral countries, but when the NNRC refuses to accept their unreasonable demands, they roar wildly.
    The United States' domineering behavior is intolerable. The NNRC's rejection of Hamblen's absurd protest is entirely justified.
    The American aggressors' conspiracy to continue forcibly detaining prisoners of war has been further exposed. Hamblen has failed.

    汉布伦失败了

    世界上一个最大的骗局，一个建筑在血腥的暴力基础上的骗局——美国所谓中朝被俘人员“不愿遣返”的骗局，已经彻底破产了。制造这个骗局的刽子手们慌成了一团。自从中朝方面不直接遣返的被俘人员移交中立国遣返委员会看管以来，美国的反动分子就像热锅上的蚂蚁一样在急着使用种种卑鄙无耻的手段来企图阻挠、破坏对战俘的解释和访问工作。为了达到这个罪恶的目的，他们对经过双方提名、协议、邀请出来的中立国遣返委员会也在横蛮地进行攻击、侮辱、威胁和干涉。
    中立国遣返委员会邀请双方代表观察了移交战俘的工作，美方和美国宣传机器就叫嚣反对；中立国遣返委员会在九月二十六日向战俘发表了一封保证战俘可以自由地运用被遣返权利的公告信，美方又大肆加以诬蔑和诽谤；美方遣返组组长汉布伦还公然提出“抗议”来。中立国遣返委员会公布了“解释和访问工作细则”，美方更加恼怒了。
    为什么在美国侵略者的眼中，中立国遣返委员会的一举一动，竟是这也不行，那也不行呢？这是因为中立国遣返委员会的这些公正措施，不利于美方强迫扣留战俘的卑鄙计谋。
    很久以来，美国用强迫“甄别”、刺字、挖心、剖腹、挖眼睛等等凶残手段迫使大批的中朝被俘人员“拒绝遣返”、并且派遣大批特务混入战俘营中对战俘横加控制以后，刽子手们曾经洋洋得意地以为他们扣留战俘的罪恶目的完全可以达到了。美方遣返组组长汉布伦无耻地说：如果美国把“一万五千名”中国人民志愿军被俘人员扣留下来了，那末，“我们（美国）就赢得了我们这一时代的心理战”。可是，刽子手们这个“如意算盘”完全打错了，罪恶的血手终久扼杀不了战俘们要求回家过和平生活的意愿。他们刚刚被移交到中立国遣返委员会手中，就有一百多人冲破特务的控制要求遣返了。美国布置的一整套扣留战俘的计划和步骤，也被一个一个地揭露在世界人民的面前了。于是，老羞成怒的美国豺狼们率性就来一个不要脸，干脆拿出耍死狗的一套老本钱来。比如，他们曾自称是“遵守协议”的，但是，却闭着眼睛反对中立国遣返委员会根据“职权范围”第一款的规定邀请双方代表观察接收战俘的工作。他们不断地重复“不得允许以任何方式或为任何目的对战俘人身施以暴力或侮辱其尊严或自尊”这句话，但是却反对中立国遣返委员会根据这一规定所拟订的禁止蒋李特务对战俘施行暴力的办法，而坚持战俘有权“集体地”接受或拒绝接受解释，以便蒋李特务继续控制和胁迫战俘。他们甚至公开承认：“别的战俘（指蒋李特务）已誓言要杀死任何一个即使只参加一个解释会议的战俘”（合众社九月十九日电）。他们曾一再声明已经将停战协定内容告知全体战俘，但是据蒂迈雅中将证实，美方故意对战俘隐瞒和歪曲了“职权范围”协议中的某些重要条款。他们口口声声尊重中立国，但是当中立国遣返委员会拒绝接受他们的无理要求的时候，他们就大肆咆哮起来。
    美国这种横行霸道的行径，是不能容忍的。中立国遣返委员会拒绝汉布伦的荒谬抗议，是完全正当的。
    美国侵略者企图继续强迫扣留战俘的阴谋进一步暴露出来了。汉布伦失败了。
