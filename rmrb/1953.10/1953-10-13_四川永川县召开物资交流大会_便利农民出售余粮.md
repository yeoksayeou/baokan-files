    Sichuan Yongchuan County Holds Materials Exchange Conference
    Facilitates Farmers' Sale of Surplus Grain
    The industry and commerce departments of the Yongchuan County People's Government in Sichuan Province convened a materials exchange conference to organize state-owned and private commerce to supply goods needed by farmers and facilitate farmers' sale of surplus grain.
    Yongchuan County is an important grain-producing area. This year, the county's average grain production increased by more than 10% compared to last year. Farmers have a large surplus of grain to sell, but because grass-roots cooperatives did not make sufficient preparations for goods in advance, some commodities experienced shortages after the grain department began purchasing in mid-August. The county-wide materials exchange conference held by the Yongchuan County People's Government's industry and commerce departments in the second half of September initially solved this problem. The central task of the conference was to further promote the exchange of materials in order to meet farmers' needs for means of production and means of livelihood. Before the conference, state-owned commerce and cooperatives made full preparations and organized private merchants to participate in the transaction. The conference lasted from September 16th to 22nd, with a total turnover of more than 9.1 billion yuan, of which industrial and handicraft products accounted for more than 56%. Farmers saw that they could buy back the items they needed after selling their grain, so they actively sold their surplus grain, and some farmers sold grain several times in one day. During the conference, the amount of grain purchased by state-owned grain companies and cooperatives increased. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    四川永川县召开物资交流大会
    便利农民出售余粮
    四川省永川县人民政府工商行政部门召开物资交流大会，组织公私商业供应农民需要的货物，便利农民出售余粮。
    永川县是重要产粮地区，今年全县粮食平均较去年增产一成以上，农民有大量余粮需要出售，但由于各基层合作社事前物资准备不够充分，自八月中旬粮食部门开始收购后，部分商品发生脱销现象。永川县人民政府工商行政部门九月下半月举办的全县物资交流大会，初步解决了这个问题。大会中心任务是进一步开展物资交流，以满足农民对生产资料和生活资料的需要。会前，国营商业和合作社都作了充分准备，并组织了私商参加交易。大会自九月十六日起到二十二日结束，成交总额达九十一亿多元，其中工业品和手工业品成交比例占百分之五十六强。农民看到卖了粮食后能够买回他们需要的物品，因此踊跃出售余粮，有的农民在一天之内连卖几次粮食。在大会召开期间，国营粮食公司和合作社收购粮食的数量都增加了。（据新华社讯）
