The "Ningbo Dazhong" (Ningbo Masses) newspaper reporter group, during its investigation in Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province's Jiatang Township before the autumn harvest on the reasons for increased and decreased production this year, summarized the experience that mass planting of green manure crops (purple clover, alfalfa) can increase yields and reduce costs, and produced an investigative report on this issue. The CCP Ningbo Prefectural Committee attached great importance to this matter and immediately, based on the issues raised and the materials reflected in the investigation report, issued a circular to its subordinate Party committees at all levels on the need to prioritize leading farmers in planting green manure well in the autumn planting work.

The circular pointed out: This investigation report shows that in rice-growing areas, if the masses are earnestly led to plant green manure well, coupled with other necessary conditions, it is possible to achieve the goal of producing more grain and reducing costs. The growth of crops depends first and foremost on base fertilizer, and the roots of purple clover and alfalfa can be used as the best and most important base fertilizer for rice. In the past, we blindly advocated increasing top dressing in some places, regardless of cost. This practice was wrong and detached from the masses. Therefore, all levels of Party committees are required to seize the link of planting green manure well first in leading the autumn planting work. In the past, we neglected this point or thought that farmers would plant without leadership, which was also incorrect. In order to ensure that more green manure is planted well, the leading comrades of all counties should promptly inspect and guide the work of supply and marketing cooperatives and the People's Bank, ensure the supply of green manure seeds and the fertilizers needed, achieve timely sowing, timely loans to help some poor farmers overcome the difficulties in planting green manure, strengthen technical guidance for green manure planting, and promptly summarize and exchange the experience of the masses.

After this circular and investigation report were published in the "Ningbo Dazhong" newspaper, they were welcomed by the farmers throughout the entire special district. Xu Liangyu, a farmer from Yin County, wrote to the newspaper saying: "Our Party newspaper's guidance in our production is the most satisfactory this time. The way to increase grain production has been found, and the method to reduce costs has been studied." Farmers in Yingjia Village, Cixi County, said after hearing the newspaper read: "Every sentence is in line with our hearts."

Under the leadership of the CCP Ningbo Prefectural Committee, all economic departments closely cooperated with the work of planting green manure. Banks promptly issued agricultural loans. Yan A'ding, a farmer in Fenghua Chengguan District, said: "The People's Government has a lot of experience in leading production! Last year, working comrades came and said to buy chemical fertilizers. The bank only came to give us loans to buy chemical fertilizers when the rice was growing poorly. As a result, we spent more money and got fewer benefits. This year, the loan was issued at just the right time." Wang Mingfu, a farmer in Fangmen District, said after receiving the loan: "Green manure is our first meal. I originally had no money to buy seeds and fertilizer to plant it, and I was as anxious as if I was on fire. Now I can rest assured to produce."

    中共宁波地委加强对培育绿肥的领导
    “宁波大众”报记者组秋收以前在浙江省上虞县夹塘乡调查今年增产和减产原因中，总结了群众种植绿肥植物（紫云英、苜蓿）可以增加产量、降低成本的经验，作了关于这个问题的调查报告。中共宁波地委非常重视这件事情，立即根据调查报告中所提出的问题和反映的材料，对所属各级党委发出了关于在秋种工作中首先要领导农民种好绿肥的通报。
    通报中指出：这个调查报告说明在水稻地区如能认真领导群众把绿肥种好，加上其他必要条件，就可以达到多打粮食、降低成本的要求。作物生长好坏首先取决于基肥，而紫云英、苜蓿的根，就可作水稻的最好和最主要的基肥。过去我们在某些地方盲目提倡增加追肥，不计成本，这种作法是错误的，是脱离群众的。因此，要求各级党委在领导秋种工作中首先抓住种好绿肥这个环节。过去我们忽视这一点，或认为农民会种不用领导，这种思想也是不对的。为了保证把绿肥种多、种好，各县领导方面应当及时检查指导供销合作社、人民银行的工作，保证绿肥的种子及其所需肥料的供应，做到及时播种，及时贷款帮助部分贫困农民克服在种绿肥上的困难，并加强绿肥种植的技术指导，及时总结和交流群众的经验。
    这个通报和调查报告在“宁波大众”报上发表以后，得到了全专区农民的欢迎。鄞县农民徐良玉写信给报社说：“我们的党报在指导我们生产中要算这一次最使我们满意。增产粮食的门道被找到了，降低成本的办法给研究出来了。”慈溪县应家村农民听了读报以后说：句句话都合我们的心意。
    在中共宁波地委的领导下，各经济部门都密切配合了种绿肥的工作。银行及时地发放了农贷。奉化城关区农民颜阿定说：“人民政府领导生产经验多啦！去年工作同志来，说买化学肥料，银行看到稻子长得不好的时候才来贷款叫我们买化学肥料追。结果，化钱多，好处少。今年这贷款发得正是时候。”方门区农民王明夫领到贷款后说：“绿肥是我们的第一口饭粮。我本来没有钱买种子和肥料种它，心里像火烧一样着急。现在可安心生产了。”
