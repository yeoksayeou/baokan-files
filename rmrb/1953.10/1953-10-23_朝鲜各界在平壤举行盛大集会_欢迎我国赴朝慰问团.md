Leaders of various democratic parties and mass organizations, Kim Dal-hyun, Jung Sung-un, and Han Seol-ya, as well as representatives from all sectors of the people of Pyongyang and commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers also attended the meeting. Diplomatic officials from the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries stationed in North Korea, as well as Gan Yetao, Chargé d'Affaires of our Embassy in North Korea, also attended. Representatives from the Korean Chinese Overseas Chinese Federation also participated in the meeting.

When General He Long, head of the delegation, and deputy heads Xing Xiping, Zhang Bojun, Cai Tingkai, Zhang Naiqi, Zhu Xuefan, Chen Yi, Wu Han, Liu Zhiming, Kang Keqing, Mei Lanfang, Lao She, and Zhou Xinfang, accompanied by Korean party, government, and military leaders and Gan Yetao, Chargé d'Affaires of our Embassy in North Korea, ascended the rostrum, a storm of applause erupted throughout the venue.

The conference began with the national anthems of China and North Korea, and Korean girls came on stage one after another to present flowers to the leaders of the delegation as a sign of respect. Kim Il, representative of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front and Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, delivered a welcome speech first. He said: The Korean people warmly welcome the Third Chinese People's Delegation to North Korea with infinite gratitude and love; and they want to express their deep gratitude and respect to the great Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and their great leader Chairman Mao Zedong. The brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people in the construction cause and the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea are one of the important guarantees for the Korean people to achieve victory. The assistance of the Chinese people to us and the merits established by the Chinese People's Volunteers will always be remembered in the hearts of the Korean people.

Choi Jong-hak, representative of the Korean People's Army and Director of the General Political Bureau of the People's Army, then delivered a welcome speech. He said: The Korean people are receiving the warm support of the international democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the great assistance of the Chinese people. Therefore, the struggle of the Korean military and civilians to restore construction and strengthen the People's Army to defend the fruits of victory will surely achieve victory. Now, although the enemy, unwilling to accept defeat, is still creating various conspiracies to undermine peace, they cannot defeat the iron-like unity between the people of North Korea and China. He congratulated the delegation on its achievements in its historically significant consolation activities.

After the welcome speeches, the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front, the Korean People's Army, and representatives of the people of Pyongyang presented three giant banners to the delegation amidst military music and enthusiastic applause. After accepting the banners, General He Long, head of the delegation, cordially shook hands with the presenters to express his thanks.

General He Long delivered a reply speech. He first expressed his gratitude for the grand welcome from the people of Pyongyang and, on behalf of the Chinese people and Chairman Mao Zedong, expressed his respect and condolences to the heroic Korean people and congratulated them on the glorious and great victory they had achieved. He said: This victory guaranteed the independence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, consolidated China's security, defended peace in the Far East and the world, and promoted the peace movement of the people of all countries in the world; it tempered and strengthened the people and the people's armies of North Korea and China. This victory further exposed the essence of U.S. imperialism as a "paper tiger" and disrupted the U.S. plan to invade the whole world. Comrades, the significance of this victory is very great, and it is worthy of our warm celebration. However, we must see that the U.S. aggressors are not reconciled to this disastrous defeat. It is now using various conspiracy methods in an attempt to undermine the armistice agreement. The people of North Korea and China must redouble their vigilance, continue to work hard, resolutely implement the armistice agreement, resolutely prevent the recurrence of aggressive war, and promote the smooth convening of the political conference to further seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.

General He Long concluded: In the future, during the period of the Korean people's restoration of peaceful construction, the Chinese people are determined to continue to deepen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, do their best to support the Korean people, and help the Korean people restore war wounds and develop the national economy until the completion of the Korean reconstruction work and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

Representatives of the delegation then presented three silk banners to the representatives of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front, the Korean People's Army, and the people of Pyongyang respectively. The entire audience stood up and applauded unanimously amidst military music.

Finally, Luo Diekai, the father of the immortal internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao and Luo Shengjiao's Korean teenager Choi, who rescued him at the cost of his own life, and his father met on the podium. They exchanged gifts, shook hands warmly, and embraced each other for a long time. At this time, the whole audience congratulated the fighting friendship forged in blood between the people of China and North Korea with long-lasting applause.

The conference concluded with the national anthems of China and North Korea.

After the meeting, the Korean National Art Theatre performed a welcome program. The delegation's cultural troupe then performed a program to thank the people of Pyongyang for their welcome.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 22nd: The Korean media unanimously expressed a warm welcome to the Third Chinese People's Delegation to North Korea.

The "Democratic Korea" newspaper published an editorial on the 22nd, saying: We warmly welcome the distinguished guests from the People's China, which has a huge impact on the fate of all mankind—the Chinese People's Delegation to North Korea, and once again express our deep gratitude to the great Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and its great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, who have aided us with blood. At the same time, we are determined to further strengthen the fraternal fighting friendship and unity between the people of North Korea and China, and march towards new victories.

The "Labor News" editorial on the same day said: The close unity forged in blood between the people of North Korea and China is continuing to strengthen during our post-war period. The Chinese people are comprehensively assisting our Korean people in the struggle to restore and build the post-war economy. On the occasion of the third anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, they have sent a delegation to North Korea to express their condolences, which will further enhance the close unity between the people of North Korea and China, thereby making new contributions to the cause of defending world peace.
