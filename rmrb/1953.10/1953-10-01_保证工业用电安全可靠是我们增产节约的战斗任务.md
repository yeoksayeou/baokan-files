Ensuring Safe and Reliable Industrial Power Supply is Our Battle Task for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
Lu Yan, Director of Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and Director of Tangshan Power Plant, a National Advanced Electric Power Plant

The Fourth National Day is approaching, and all employees of Tangshan Power Plant are actively engaged in a production increase and economy drive to celebrate this holiday.

Under the leadership of the Party and administration, all employees of Tangshan Power Plant have earnestly implemented the resolution of the National Electric Power Conference on "Striving to Eliminate Accidents and Ensuring Long-term Safe Power Transmission." They have actively, repeatedly, and continuously carried out a mass anti-accident campaign and conducted construction work related to safe production. In 1953, based on the technical assessment work of checking safety and efficiency and the discussion and revision of the national plan, they also fully mobilized the masses, tapped potential, found shortcuts, learned from Soviet advanced experience, implemented Soviet expert recommendations, and absorbed the successful experiences of fraternal power plants. By implementing regulations and systems, they basically eliminated major personal and equipment accidents. The steam turbine and boiler workshops guaranteed a record of 1,122 days of safe operation and overfulfilled various tasks assigned by higher authorities.

The basic reasons for our overfulfilling state tasks and ensuring safe power transmission are: The Party organization has strengthened political and ideological education work, constantly improving the political awareness and professional skills of employees. At the beginning of the year, the employees of Tangshan Power Plant discussed the three major tasks of the state this year and recognized their glorious responsibility in the first year of the Five-Year Economic Construction. Then, they universally discussed the national plan and conducted education on the principle that the plan is the law, enhancing the employees' sense of responsibility for supervising and guaranteeing the completion of the plan. Based on the results of the technical assessment, they also revised the technical quotas, which were lower than the national technical indicators, and formulated specific measures to ensure safety and guarantee the completion of tasks. Workshops and teams had practical monthly, weekly, and daily production plans. In the process of overfulfilling tasks month by month, the Party organization continuously carried out ideological education to prevent arrogance and complacency and prevent paralysis. As a result, employees were able to work conscientiously and seriously. In order to improve production and enhance technology, the Party committee, in addition to strengthening political and ideological education, also specifically arranged employees' spare time activities, clearly stipulating that spare time should be mainly used for employees to conduct technical studies, overcoming the phenomenon of too many meetings, too little study, and too little rest. Now, employees of Tangshan Power Plant can guarantee five hours of technical study, two hours of political study, and one hour of production self-examination meetings every week. Everyone feels relaxed and happy, and production morale is constantly high.

Ensuring safe production and continuously supplying reliable power to industry and transportation is the primary task of the electric power production department. To achieve this goal, the Party committee and administration of Tangshan Power Plant have continuously conducted safety production education, established the view of safe power generation serving industry and people's lives, criticized various conservative and erroneous ideas, and actively taken the initiative to conduct equipment inspections and formulate practical countermeasures to prevent accidents. To enable employees to experience the disasters brought to industrial production by accidents, whenever a major accident occurred, they organized employees to go to the scene to understand the negative consequences caused by the accident, in order to improve employees' vigilance and sense of responsibility.

Learning from Soviet advanced experience and implementing operating and maintenance procedures is one of the main reasons for our completion of tasks. We have experienced in our actual work that "only under the serious attention of the leadership and the earnest and thorough implementation of regulations and systems can production be placed on a safe and reliable foundation." Therefore, we organized 72 people, including the Party committee secretary, factory director, trade union chairman, engineering and technical cadres, and workshop directors, to intensively study the Soviet advanced experience "Technical Regulations for the Electric Power Industry" and formulated the plant's implementation plan based on the technical regulations. The study and implementation of these plans has become an important part of Tangshan Power Plant's technical measures to ensure safety. We also combined the study with "Technical Management Regulations," held short-term training courses, and mobilized the workers to implement regulations and systems. Soviet experts told us: "The main experience in ensuring safe production is regulations, regulations, and more regulations; learning, learning, and more learning." Under the guidance of this advanced thinking, we learn and revise regulations once a year, constantly enriching and improving their content. This is the key to enabling employees to work accurately and intensively, ensuring safe production, and improving economic efficiency.

Regularly organizing periodic inspection work, combined with the central tasks of each period, inspecting leadership, inspecting production, summarizing experience, finding out the reasons, and improving shortcomings is our main method for completing production tasks in a balanced way. There are two main inspection methods: one is to have the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League inspection team organized and led by the Party committee conduct inspections. The scope of the inspection ranges from the plant leadership to the workshop team masses, with the focus on inspecting weak links; the other method is to mobilize employees to conduct self-inspections from bottom to top. Or, the two methods are carried out simultaneously. For example, in July, during the inspection work, when it was discovered that the coal consumption quota might not be completed, the leadership promptly mobilized employees to expose loopholes and took emergency measures to formulate improvement methods, which finally enabled the monthly task to be overfulfilled.

In the assessment work, we solved the technical quotas and safety inspections, made machine appraisal tests, discovered more than 700 problems, and gradually and promptly solved them through the masses actively thinking of solutions. Based on the assessment work, we initially implemented planned management, rectified original records, established more detailed production statistical analysis work, and promoted job planning. In order to mobilize the strength of employees and give play to their enthusiasm, we also organized a safety production "red flag throughout the plant" competition movement according to the production tasks of each period, continuously signed collective contracts for completing tasks every quarter, and realized this contract.

Resolutely ensuring safe power generation and supply is the primary task of all electric power employees in the production increase and economy drive. Now, the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and Power Plant have widely launched a production increase and economy competition, mobilizing the masses to start with inspection work, tap potential, find shortcuts, and put forward rationalization proposals to ensure safety. After discussing and revising the production plan, under the requirements of ensuring safety and improving management, the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and Power Plant strive to increase production and practice economy by over 4 billion yuan. We must also make the greatest efforts to practice strict economy, burn more low-value coal to reduce fuel costs, and compress management costs under the conditions of ensuring work quality, planning to save 1.1 billion yuan for the state. We will use concrete actions of overfulfilling every month and ensuring safety every day to support basic construction and industrial and mining enterprises, to strive to complete the task of the first year of the Five-Year Plan, and to celebrate our country's Fourth National Day.

    保证工业用电安全可靠是我们增产节约的战斗任务
    唐山电业局局长兼全国电业先进厂唐山发电厂厂长  路岩
    第四届国庆节来到了，唐山发电厂的全体职工正积极的开展增产节约竞赛来庆祝这个节日。
    唐山发电厂全体职工在党和行政的领导下，切实执行了全国电业会议关于“努力消灭事故，保证长期安全发送电”的决议，积极地、反复地、持续地开展了群众性的反事故斗争，进行了关于安全生产的建设工作。一九五三年，在进行查安全、查效率的技术查定工作和讨论修订国家计划的基础上，又充分发动群众，挖潜力，找窍门，学习苏联先进经验，执行苏联专家建议，并吸取各兄弟电厂的成功经验，贯彻规程制度，因而基本上消灭了人身和设备上的重要事故，汽机、锅炉两车间保证了安全运行一千一百二十二天的纪录，并超额完成了上级给予的各项任务。
    我们超额完成国家任务和保证安全发送电的基本原因是：党的组织加强了政治思想教育工作，不断提高职工政治觉悟和业务水平。唐山电厂职工在年初曾讨论了国家今年的三大任务，认识了自己在五年经济建设第一年中的光荣责任，继而普遍讨论国家计划，又进行了计划就是法律的教育，提高了职工对完成计划的监督保证的责任心。根据技术查定结果，又修订了较国家技术指标为低的技术定额，并制订了保证安全、保证完成任务的具体措施，车间、小组都有切合实际的逐月逐周及小组逐日的生产计划。在逐月超额完成任务中，党的组织又不断进行了防止骄傲自满、防止麻痹的思想教育，因而职工都能兢兢业业，谨慎严肃地进行工作。党委为了搞好生产，提高技术，除去加强政治思想教育外，并具体的布置了职工业余时间的活动，明确规定业余时间主要是给职工多进行技术学习，克服会议多、学习少、休息少的现象。现在唐山电厂职工每周都能保证有五小时技术学习，二小时政治学习，一小时生产自我检查会制度。大家都感到轻松愉快，生产情绪经常饱满。
    保证安全生产，连续供给工业、运输业可靠电源，是电业生产部门的首要任务。为了达到这个目的，唐山电厂的党委和行政曾不断进行安全生产教育，树立安全发电为工业和人民生活服务的观点，批判了各种保守的错误的思想，同时并积极主动进行设备摸底，制定出切实防止事故的对策。为了使职工体验到由于事故带给工业生产的灾害，当重大事故发生后，便组织职工到现场了解事故所造成的恶果，来提高职工的警惕性和责任感。
    学习苏联先进经验，贯彻运行操作规程与检修规程，是我们完成任务的主要原因之一。我们在实际工作中体验到：“只有在领导认真重视下，切实的彻底的贯彻规程制度，才能把生产放在安全可靠的基础上”。因此，我们曾组织了党委书记、厂长、工会主席及工程技术干部、车间主任等七十二人突击学习了苏联先进经验“电力工业技术法规”，并根据技术法规作出了本厂的实施方案，这些方案的学习与实行，成为唐山发电厂保证安全技术措施的重要部分。我们还结合学习了“技术管理法规”，举办了短期轮训班，发动工人群众贯彻规程制度。苏联专家告诉我们：“保证安全生产的主要经验，就是规程、规程、再规程，学习、学习、再学习”。在这个先进思想的指导下，我们每年一次学习与修订规程，不断充实与提高其内容，这是使得职工们能准确而紧张地工作、保证安全生产、提高经济效率的关键。
    经常组织定期检查工作，结合每个时期的中心任务，检查领导，检查生产情况，总结经验，查出原因，改进缺点，这是我们均衡完成生产任务的主要方法。检查方法主要有二种，一种是由党委组织领导的党、政、工会、青年团检查工作组进行检查，检查范围是由厂的领导到车间小组群众，重点是检查薄弱环节；一种方法是发动职工由下而上自我检查。或者是两种方法同时并进。如七月份在检查工作中，发现煤耗定额可能完不成任务时，领导上便及时动员职工揭发漏洞，并采取紧急措施，制订改进办法，终于使月终能超额完成任务。
    我们在查定工作中解决了技术定额与安全检查，作了机器的鉴定性试验，发现问题七百余件，通过群众积极想办法逐步而及时地予以解决，并在查定工作基础上，初步实行了计划管理，整顿原始记录，建立较细致的生产统计分析工作，推行作业计划。为了动员职工力量，发挥职工积极性，我们并按每个时期的生产任务，组织安全生产满堂红的竞赛运动，连续签订每季完成任务的集体合同，并实现了这个合同。
    坚决保证安全发供电，是电业全体职工在增产节约竞赛运动里的首要任务。现在，唐山电业局和发电厂已广泛展开了增产节约竞赛，发动群众由检查工作入手，挖潜力、找窍门、提出合理化建议，确保安全。经过讨论修订生产计划，在保证安全、改进管理的要求下，唐山电业局和发电厂增产节约争取超额四十亿元。我们还要以最大努力来厉行节约，多烧低值煤以降低燃料成本，在保证工作质量条件下压缩管理费用，拟为国家节约财富十一亿元。我们要以月月超额，日日安全的具体行动，来支援基本建设和工矿企业，为完成五年计划第一年的任务而奋斗，并以此庆祝我国第四届国庆节。
