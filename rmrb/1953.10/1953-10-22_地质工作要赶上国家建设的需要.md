    Geological Work Must Catch Up with the Needs of National Construction
    China's geological work has seen significant development this year. The geological exploration teams of the Central Geological Department have doubled in size compared to the beginning of the year, and the number of drilling rigs in operation has increased nearly fourfold compared to the end of last year. Geological work has been preliminarily organized according to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and has been incorporated into the national plan. Exploration projects have been determined according to the needs of national construction. The workload of the Ministry of Geology in 1953 has increased by 5.15 times compared to 1952. This tremendous development in geological work has allowed Chinese geologists to move out of the narrow field of research that had long been limited to a few individuals conducting uncoordinated and scattered investigations of stratigraphy, paleontology, and general geological structures, as well as the collection of rock and mineral specimens and fossil specimens. It has changed the face of China's geological work. It marks the entry of geological work into a new historical stage of serving national economic construction.
    However, compared with the needs of the country, although the geological work force has grown and improved significantly in the past four years, it is still far from sufficient. Moreover, geological work has had some shortcomings in the past. For example, the purposefulness and comprehensiveness of geological work are not yet reflected in every step of geological exploration. We have not learned enough, deeply enough, or thoroughly enough from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. There is still a degree of blindness in our work, and we cannot better organize the limited geological forces to maximize their role. In short, the current geological work is still not keeping up with the needs of national construction. Therefore, we must continue to make the greatest efforts to improve the level of geological work and continue to expand our forces.
    Geological work is a preliminary step in industrial construction. Experience over the past few years has proven that correct design is impossible without correct geological data; and without correct design, construction cannot be carried out. Whether it is steel, non-ferrous metals, coal mines, petroleum, or some building materials and chemical industries, geological work must first obtain accurate mineral data before design and construction can begin. In order to carry out construction projects, geologists must not only provide mineral data for the main raw materials, but also mineral data for auxiliary raw materials; not only must they do surface geological work, but also drilling, tunneling, physical prospecting, trenching, and other exploration work, as well as sampling and testing work; not only must they study mineral geology, but also hydrogeology. Experience over the past few years has proven that without geological work, it is impossible to fully grasp the underground resources, and without the guarantee of resources, the production of certain industries will be affected.
    With the start of the country's planned economic construction, the importance of geological work has become more prominent. The current geological work must not only ensure the timely completion of geological data for important construction projects in the first Five-Year Plan, but also systematically prepare the mineral resources needed for the second Five-Year Plan.
    In its instructions for deploying future work, the Central Geological Department analyzed the main shortcomings of current geological work and put forward the basic tasks and directions for future efforts. These instructions are entirely correct. In order to further improve geological work, we need to do a lot of work. First of all, we must implement the policy of ensuring geological work for key construction projects. China's first Five-Year Plan will begin the construction of many new factories and mines, especially the 141 large-scale projects that the Soviet government is helping China to build and renovate. These projects are the focus of China's planned economic construction. Once these projects are completed, they will greatly increase China's industrial production capacity and lay a solid foundation for China's industrialization. A large part of these projects require Chinese geologists to provide geological and mineral data. The main task of current geological work is to make every effort to ensure the timely completion of resource exploration for these enterprises. In the past, some geological personnel in key exploration teams did not understand the policy of ensuring key construction. They did not realize that the work they were undertaking was crucial to the country's construction. Therefore, they listened to their personal interests and were unwilling to undertake the task of mine exploration, but only wanted to participate in certain work that was not urgently needed at the moment. This has made their activities deviate from the country's most pressing needs. Therefore, we must constantly and patiently educate geological personnel, not allowing their daily activities to deviate from the requirements of the country for a moment, and be good at organizing forces to ensure key areas.
    With the correct policy, we also need to correctly deploy our forces and take the correct steps to put geological work on a scientific track. The key issue is to formulate detailed and specific exploration designs and deploy geological exploration work in accordance with the geological exploration procedures. The geological exploration procedure reflects the objective laws of geological exploration work. The exploration design must grasp these laws and formulate an action program and specific measures for geological exploration work according to the characteristics of different ore deposits and different geological structures. Before the mine exploration work is carried out, surface geological work must be carried out first, and for this purpose, trenching, shallow well exploration, physical prospecting, test drilling, and chemical analysis work must be carried out to clarify the geological structure and the interrelationship of rocks, to truly understand the strike and dip of the ore body, to make accurate geological maps, to make detailed and specific exploration designs, and then to start mine exploration.
    The main shortcoming of some geological work at present is that they often carry out blind exploration without a correct exploration design, resulting in the waste of manpower and material resources and delaying valuable time. For example, in the Zhuling'ao Iron Mine, sufficient surface geological work was not carried out. Only an exploration plan was drawn up based on an inaccurate geological sketch, and a large number of heavy mountain works were deployed. As a result, due to the unclear geological conditions, many drilling rigs were arranged on fault lines, failing to reach the ore. Some drill holes have been scrapped as a result; some are in a dilemma of being unable to advance or retreat. Geological personnel should learn from this lesson, earnestly implement the geological exploration procedures, do a good job in exploration design, and proceed in an orderly manner, in order to strengthen the planned management of geological work, improve the quality of geological work, improve the efficiency of geological work, and overcome the blindness and waste of geological work, so as to quickly and economically explore underground minerals.
    Ensuring the balanced work of all aspects of geological work is also a very important issue. Whether it is geological surveying, drilling, tunneling, trenching, physical prospecting and other exploration work, whether it is sampling, testing and mineral identification work, data collation and comprehensive research work, whether it is the exploration work of various auxiliary raw materials and hydrogeological work, all are important components of the entire geological exploration work, so they must be developed in a balanced manner. However, this comprehensive characteristic of geological work is often overlooked, resulting in many serious weak links in the current geological work. The work of data collation and comprehensive research has not been carried out in a timely manner due to the old habit of "settling accounts at the end of the year," which has restricted geologists and made it difficult to continuously improve their understanding of the mining area and further guide exploration work. Sampling and testing work is even far behind geological exploration work, and some even have no sampling at all; or the sampling is not up to standard, so that the exploration work in many areas is continuing with great blindness, and it is even impossible to obtain the results of exploration. The exploration of auxiliary mineral raw materials is also far behind the exploration of main mineral raw materials. Hydrogeological work has not even started. These weak links make it impossible to tightly connect the entire process of geological exploration work, making it difficult to quickly provide comprehensive technical and economic data to industrial departments. Therefore, these weak links must be improved immediately in order to quickly, correctly, and comprehensively prepare resource exploration reports.
    The geological exploration team is a newly formed team, and the personnel come from all directions, with different political consciousness and ideological styles, and they are scattered in remote mountains and wild areas. Therefore, strengthening political work has become an extremely important link. In political work, it is necessary to implement the Party's policy towards technical personnel, and strengthen the unity between technical personnel and administrative cadres, technical personnel and workers, and technical personnel and technical personnel. It is necessary to improve the political consciousness of technical personnel, earnestly organize technical personnel to study the theory and advanced experience of Soviet geological work, and improve their professional level. It is necessary to educate transferred cadres to work with peace of mind and delve into their work. It is necessary to educate workers to abide by labor discipline, improve their awareness, and learn technology. It is necessary to educate trainees, who account for a large proportion of the geological exploration team, to overcome the idea of aiming too high and working in a down-to-earth manner to learn from their work. We must do our best to improve the material and cultural life of field workers.
    Geological work is a glorious and important work. People call geologists "industrial scouts" and "pioneers of economic construction." Geologists! Catch up with the needs of national industrial construction and strive to explore various underground resources!

### 地质工作要赶上国家建设的需要

    地质工作要赶上国家建设的需要
    我国地质工作今年以来有了很大的发展。中央地质部的地质勘探队伍较年初壮大了一倍，开动的钻机较去年年底增加了近四倍。地质工作已初步地按照苏联的先进经验组织起来，并已纳入了国家计划的轨道。按照国家建设的需要，确定了勘探项目。一九五三年地质部的工作量已较一九五二年增加了五点一五倍。地质工作的这个巨大的发展，使我国地质工作者走出了长期以来局限于少数人凭着个人的努力，无计划地分散地进行一些地层、古生物和一般地质构造的调查，以及岩石矿物、化石标本的收集等研究工作的狭小领域，改变了我国地质工作的面貌。它标志着地质工作已进入为国家经济建设服务的新的历史阶段。
    但是，和国家的需要相比较，我国地质工作力量四年来虽然有了很大的发展和提高，但仍然显得十分不足。而且地质工作过去还存在一些缺点，例如地质工作的目的性和综合性还不能体现在地质勘探的每一个步骤上，对苏联先进经验还学得不多、不深、不透，工作中还存在不同程度的盲目性，还不能更好地把仅有的地质力量组织起来发挥最大的作用。总之，目前的地质工作还赶不上国家建设的需要，因此必须继续以最大的努力，提高地质工作的水平，继续壮大力量。
    地质工作是工业建设的先行步骤。几年来的经验证明，没有正确的地质资料就无法进行正确的设计；而没有正确的设计，也就不能进行建设。无论是钢铁、有色金属、煤矿、石油，以及一部分建筑材料和化学工业，都必须先由地质工作去取得精确的矿产资料，才能着手设计和建筑。为了进行建设工程，地质工作者不仅是要提出主要原料的矿产资料，还要提出辅助原料的矿产资料；不仅是要作地面地质工作，还要作好钻探、坑探、物理探矿、槽探等各种勘探工作和采样化验工作；不仅是要研究矿产地质，还要研究水文地质。几年来的经验证明：没有地质工作，就不能充分掌握地下资源情况，而资源没有保证，也就会影响某些工业的生产。
    随着国家有计划的经济建设的开始，地质工作的重要性更加突出地表现出来。当前的地质工作不仅要保证按时作出第一个五年计划中重要建设项目的地质资料，而且要有步骤地准备第二个五年计划所需要的矿产资源。
    中央地质部在部署今后工作的指示中，分析了目前地质工作的主要缺点，提出了今后的基本任务和努力方向。这个指示是完全正确的。为了进一步改进地质工作，我们需要做很多工作，首先就是要贯彻确保重点建设工程的地质工作的方针。我国第一个五年计划，将开始建设很多新的工厂矿山，尤其是苏联政府帮助我国新建和改建的一百四十一项规模巨大的工程，这些工程是我国有计划的经济建设的重点，这些工程建成后，将大大增长我国工业生产的能力，为我国的工业化奠定一个稳固的基础。这些工程中有很大一部分需要我国地质工作者提供地质矿产资料。当前地质工作的主要任务，就在于尽一切努力，保证按时完成这些企业的资源勘探工作。过去有一些重点勘探队的地质人员就没有了解确保重点建设的方针，他们不知道自己所担负的工作是对国家建设举足轻重的，因而听凭个人的兴趣，不愿担负矿区勘探的任务，而只愿参加某些不是当前急需的工作。这就使他们的活动离开了国家最迫切的需要。因此，要经常地耐心教育地质人员，不让自己的日常活动有一刻离开国家的要求，要善于组织力量，确保重点。
    有了正确的方针，还需要正确地布置我们的力量，采取正确的步骤，把地质工作放在科学的轨道上。关键的问题，就是要按照地质勘探程序，制订详细的、具体的勘探设计，部署地质勘探工作。地质勘探程序反映了地质勘探工作的客观规律，勘探设计必须掌握这些规律，根据不同的矿床和不同地质构造的特点，拟订地质勘探工作的行动纲领和具体措施。在矿区勘探工作开展之前，一定要首先作地面地质工作，并为此而进行槽探、浅井探、物理探矿、试探钻和化验分析工作，弄清地质的构造和岩石的相互关系，真实地了解矿体的走向和倾斜，制成准确的地质图，作出详细的、具体的勘探设计，再开始进行矿区勘探。
    目前某些地质工作的主要缺点，就在于常常没有正确的勘探设计就盲目勘探，以致造成人力物力的浪费，延误了宝贵的时间。例如株岭坳铁矿，没有进行充分的地面地质工作，只根据一张不精确的地质草图就拟订了勘探计划，布置了大量的重型山地工作，结果因地质情况不明，许多钻机布置在断层线上，打不到矿，有的钻眼已因此报废；有的正处在进退两难的困境中。地质人员应从这种教训中吸取经验，认真贯彻地质勘探程序，做好勘探设计，循序渐进，才能加强地质工作的计划管理，改进地质工作的质量，提高地质工作的效率，克服地质工作的盲目性和浪费现象，从而迅速地经济地探明地下矿产。
    保证地质工作各个环节的均衡工作，也是一个十分重要的问题。无论是地质测量工作，钻探、坑探、槽探、物理探矿等各种勘探工作，无论是采样、化验和矿物鉴定工作、资料的整理和综合研究工作，也无论是各种辅助原料的勘探工作和水文地质工作，都是整个地质勘探工作中的一个重要组成部分，因此都必须均衡地发展。可是，这个地质工作的综合性的特点，却往往被人忽视，以致地质工作中目前存在许多严重的薄弱环节。资料的整理和综合研究工作，由于沿袭着“年终算总账”的旧习，一直没有及时进行，以致束缚了地质工作者，难以不断提高自己对矿区的认识，进一步指导勘探工作。采样化验工作更远远落后于地质勘探工作，甚至有的根本没有采样；或采而不合规格，以致许多地区的勘探工作在继续进行中带有很大的盲目性，甚至无法取得勘探的成果。辅助矿物原料的勘探工作也远远落后于主要矿物原料的勘探工作。水文地质工作甚至尚未着手进行。这些薄弱环节使整个地质勘探工作的过程不能紧紧的衔接起来，难以迅速为工业部门提供全面的技术经济资料。因此，必须立即改进这些薄弱环节，以便于迅速的，正确的，全面的作出资源勘探报告。
    地质勘探工作的队伍是一个新组成的队伍，人员来自四面八方，政治觉悟和思想作风各不相同，而又分散在荒山僻野工作，因此加强政治工作就成为极其重要的一环。在政治工作中，要贯彻党对技术人员的政策，加强技术人员与行政干部，技术人员与工人，技术人员与技术人员之间的团结。要提高技术人员的政治觉悟，认真组织技术人员学习苏联地质工作的理论和先进经验，提高业务水平。要教育转业的干部安心工作，钻研业务。要教育工人遵守劳动纪律，提高觉悟，学习技术。要教育在地质勘探队伍中占很大比例的练习生克服好高骛远的思想，踏踏实实地从工作中去学习。要尽力改善野外工作人员的物质生活和文化生活。
    地质工作是一个光荣的、重要的工作。人们称呼地质工作者是“工业化的侦察兵”“经济建设的开路先锋”。地质工作者们！赶上国家工业建设的需要，努力勘测各种地下资源！
