    Exceeding National Plan for 21 Consecutive Months
    Tangshan Power Plant Awarded "Model Factory" Title
    [Our Newspaper] The Tangshan Power Plant has strengthened and improved its technical management work, established a responsibility system, and has exceeded the national plan for 21 consecutive months from January 1952 to September this year. It was awarded the honorary titles of "National Advanced Power Industry Factory" and "North China Power Industry Model Factory." In September, the plant launched an increase production and practice economy movement, and comprehensively completed various planned targets, with power generation exceeding the plan by 2.58%; electricity sales exceeding the plan by 9.87%; plant electricity consumption reduced by 5.33% compared to the plan; and coal consumption reduced by 0.17% compared to the plan.
    Under the joint efforts of the Party and government leadership and all employees, and with the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, the Tangshan Power Plant has transformed from a technically backward and poorly managed old factory into a new type of enterprise in just a few years. Firstly, it has achieved great success in safety production, with no major personal accidents occurring in recent years. As of now, the machine and boiler workshops have been operating safely for 1,122 days. At the same time, on the basis of ensuring safety, it has continuously exceeded the national plan for 21 consecutive months.
    The main reason why the Tangshan Power Plant has achieved such great results is that the factory leadership has always attached importance to technical management work. Starting in the second quarter of this year, the plant leadership led all employees in carrying out a major safety inspection movement, clearly putting forward the policy of "Production must be safe, safety is for production," and analyzed the problems found during the inspection to find the causes. Through this inspection, it was affirmed that as long as the regulations and systems are conscientiously implemented and a responsibility system is established, safety will definitely be achieved. Finally, specific measures and plans were made. In addition, the plant spent three weeks, divided into comprehensive, power, and thermal groups, to intensively study the Soviet power industry technical management regulations. Afterwards, each workshop formulated a plan to promote the regulations. In the third quarter, targeting the characteristics of the season, a struggle against wind, lightning, and rain accidents was launched in depth to ensure the safety of power supply lines. At the same time, a forum for technicians was held, and on the basis of unifying the thinking of the technicians, a maintenance professional meeting was held, from which preliminary technical measures for the overhaul of a certain machine, electricity, and furnace were proposed based on summarizing past maintenance work experience. On the one hand, employees were widely mobilized to use their brains to improve operating skills to ensure the safe completion of various indicators. For example, the boiler Liu Wu group not only conscientiously implemented the unified operation method, but also formulated a practical weekly plan for the group to reduce coal consumption. Everyone kept in mind the various indicators in the plan, checked the completion status at any time, and analyzed them, thinking of solutions according to the nature of the problem. The machine, electricity, and furnace workshops strengthened contact. The boiler workshop reported coal consumption to the machine and electricity workshops every hour, and the machine and electricity workshops reported the load increase and decrease trends, vacuum, and steam consumption to the boiler workshop every hour, so that the firemen had a clear idea and paid attention to controlling combustion at any time, which played a great role in reducing coal consumption and fuel costs.
    The generators of the Tangshan Power Plant have all reached their nameplate output. The equipment utilization rate this year has increased by 50% compared to 1949, the power generation this year has increased by 68.9% compared to 1949, the coal consumption per kilowatt-hour has been reduced to 0.558 kg (chain grate furnace), and the plant electricity consumption rate has been reduced to 4.08%. These achievements are very prominent among power plants nationwide.

    连续二十一个月超额完成国家计划
    唐山发电厂荣获“模范工厂”称号
    【本报讯】唐山发电厂加强与提高了技术管理工作，建立了责任制度，从一九五二年一月到今年九月连续二十一个月超额完成国家计划，荣获“全国电业先进工厂”及“华北电业模范工厂”的光荣称号。九月份，该厂开展了增产节约运动，全面完成了各项计划指标，计发电量超额完成百分之二点五八；售电量超额完成百分之九点八七；厂用电较计划降低了百分之五点三三；煤耗较计划降低了百分之零点一七。
    唐山发电厂在党政领导和全体职工的共同努力和苏联专家的热诚帮助之下，经过短短的几年工夫，已从一个技术落后、管理紊乱的旧厂，变成了新型的企业。首先在安全生产方面获得了很大的成绩，几年来从未发生过重大的人身事故。到目前止，机、炉两车间已安全运转一千一百二十二天。同时在保证安全的基础上，已连续二十一个月超额完成了国家计划。
    唐山发电厂所以能取得这样大的成绩，主要是工厂领导方面一贯重视技术管理工作。今年第二季度开始，该厂领导方面领导全体职工开展了安全大检查运动，明确提出了“生产必须安全，安全为了生产”的方针，并把检查出来的问题进行了分析，找出了原因。通过这次检查，肯定了只要认真贯彻规程制度，建立起责任制度，安全就一定获得成绩，最后并作出了具体措施计划。此外，该厂又以三个星期的时间，分综合、电力、热力三组，突击学习了苏联电力工业技术管理法规。以后，各车间都订出了推行法规的方案。在第三季度，更针对季节的特性，深入展开反风、雷、雨事故的斗争，以确保线路供电的安全。同时还召开了技术人员座谈会，又在技术人员思想统一的基础上召开了检修专业会议，从总结过去的检修工作经验中，提出了某号机、电、炉大修的初步技术措施方案。一方面广泛发动职工开动脑筋，提高操作技术保证安全地完成各项指标，如锅炉刘武小组，不仅认真执行了统一操作法，而且订出了小组降低燃煤的切实可行的周计划，每人对计划中的各项指标都牢记在心，随时检查完成情况，加以研究分析，针对问题性质，想出解决办法。机、电、炉三个车间加强了联系，锅炉车间每一小时向机、电两车间报告煤耗情况，机、电两车间每一小时向锅炉车间报告负荷涨落趋势及真空、汽耗等情况，使司火人员心中有数，随时注意控制燃烧，这对降低煤耗及燃料成本起了很大的作用。
    唐山发电厂发电机已全部达到铭牌出力，设备利用率今年比一九四九年提高了百分之五十，发电量今年比一九四九年提高了百分之六十八点九，每发一度电的煤耗降低到零点五五八公斤（练条炉），厂用电率曾降低到百分之四点○八：这些成绩在全国电厂中是很突出的。
