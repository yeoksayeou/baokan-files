    Visiting the Pulkovo Central Astronomical Observatory of the Soviet Union
    Zhang Yuzhe, Member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Delegation to the Soviet Union
    The Pulkovo Observatory is the main astronomical observatory under the system of the All-Union Academy of Sciences. During their stay in Leningrad, the delegation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, consisting of more than forty members, spent a day visiting this largest astronomical observatory in the Soviet Union.
    The Pulkovo Observatory has a long history. It was founded in 1725 during the reign of Peter the Great. Initially, it was located on an island in the Neva River in St. Petersburg. The fog on the river was very heavy. With the development of St. Petersburg, houses and lights gradually surrounded the observatory, hindering its observation work. Therefore, from the end of the 18th century, during the reign of Empress Catherine II, some people suggested moving the observatory to another location more conducive to observation. It was not until 1830 that it was decided to move it to Pulkovo Hill, 17 kilometers south of St. Petersburg. On August 1839, the Pulkovo Observatory was officially established. The first director, V. Struve, was not only able to complete the arduous task of building the observatory but also had the foresight to define the direction of the observatory's work. Its 15-inch aperture telescope was an unparalleled instrument at the time. In addition, there were meridian circles, transit instruments, and vertical circles for determining longitude and latitude.
    Director Struve's two research projects symbolized the dual mission of astronomical work: on the one hand, to help solve practical problems such as calendar making, timekeeping, geodetic surveying, and aviation and navigation; on the other hand, to understand the universe and nature through constant careful observation and research. Whether measuring the longitude and latitude of cities or aviation and navigation requires looking at the stars. However, the longitude and latitude of these stars in the sky must be accurately measured by the observatory before they can be used. The Pulkovo Observatory made it one of its main tasks to measure the longitude and latitude of stars and compile star catalogs. This work cannot be done once and for all. Because the position of stars on the celestial sphere also has small, slow movements. After many years, a star catalog will show discrepancies between the longitude and latitude given and the current position of the star. If measurements are made based on this catalog, the results will be inaccurate. Therefore, compiling star catalogs by measuring the longitude and latitude of stars in the observatory is a regular task. From 1845, the Pulkovo Observatory published a new star catalog every twenty years. This tradition of compiling star catalogs has been further developed. Another astronomical research work of the first director, Struve, was the discovery of thousands of binary stars in the sky. He constantly measured the distance between the binary stars and the direction indicated by the line connecting them. His discoveries may not have had much practical application at the time, but they were of great significance in understanding the universe. We originally only knew that the law of universal gravitation could be applied to the small area of the Earth, the Moon, the Sun, and the planets, but Struve's observation and research of binary stars confirmed that the law of universal gravitation can also be applied to the boundless space of stars.
    On the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Pulkovo Observatory, a 30-inch aperture refracting telescope—the largest refracting telescope at the time—was added to its instruments and equipment. Under the leadership of Director Belopolsky, this instrument was used to develop stellar spectroscopy and radial velocity observations. Many foreign astronomers came here to visit, work, and study. However, there were many inconveniences in carrying out astronomical observations in St. Petersburg. The winters here are long and rainy; due to the northern latitude, there are also long white nights in summer when it never gets dark. Therefore, in 1908, a branch observatory was established in Simeiz on the Crimean Peninsula in the south (its latitude is actually north of Beijing) to engage in astrophysical research. Soon, another branch observatory for studying positional astronomy was established in southern Ukraine.
    After the October Socialist Revolution, the work of the Pulkovo Observatory saw even greater development. Among the instruments added at this time was a huge horizontal solar telescope. A reflecting telescope with a diameter of one meter was also built at the Crimean branch. The planning of the work of the Pulkovo Observatory began to be strengthened. When encountering major problems, it would unite with other astronomical observatories in the Soviet Union to solve them jointly. For example, in order to assist in geodetic surveying and map surveying, the Pulkovo Observatory gathered the strength of five astronomical observatories to participate in the observation and compilation of a geodetic star catalog containing the longitude and latitude of three thousand stars. The success of this collective work encouraged the Pulkovo Observatory to once again mobilize other astronomical observatories to participate in the observation of faint stars and the compilation of faint star catalogs. According to this plan, the number of participating astronomical observatories increased to seven. The stars to be observed included nearly 20,000 faint stars that cannot be directly seen with the naked eye. The geodetic star catalog was for improving the accuracy of determining ground longitude and latitude, focusing on practical applications, while the purpose of compiling the faint star catalog was to meet the needs of stellar astronomy research, to establish an accurate direction system in star space.
    However, when this great plan began to be implemented, World War II broke out. Hitler's army, in order to strike at the center of Soviet industry, advanced towards Leningrad. The Pulkovo Observatory was exactly on the front line of the war. Although all the staff of the observatory, together with the Red Army, had moved valuable instruments and some books to a safe area, the large telescope and most of the books could not be moved in a hurry. These research facilities and the buildings on Pulkovo Hill were all destroyed by the German invaders' artillery fire. When the Soviet Academy of Sciences celebrated its 220th anniversary in 1945, many Soviet and foreign scholars came to Pulkovo Hill to mourn the observatory destroyed by the German invaders. Here, it was overgrown with weeds and smoke, with broken tiles and collapsed walls, and there was no difference from other fortresses that had been through war.
    The Soviet government attached great importance to the restoration of the Pulkovo Observatory. When the war had not yet ended, the Soviet government had decided to rebuild the Pulkovo Observatory. This reconstruction plan not only required restoring the old appearance of the Pulkovo Observatory but also expanding it. All the new instruments to be installed were manufactured by Soviet state factories. When our delegation to the Soviet Union visited the Pulkovo Observatory on March 27 this year, the work of rebuilding the new observatory was basically completed.
    When we visited the Pulkovo Observatory, Deputy Director Zverev introduced us to the history of the Pulkovo Observatory, showed us slides of the destruction of the Pulkovo Observatory by the German invaders, passed around photos of many newly built astronomical observatory instruments for everyone to view, and introduced us to the current work situation. He said: At present, the main projects of the Pulkovo Observatory can be divided into five categories. 1. Determine the coordinates of faint stars and compile star catalogs using visual and photographic methods. This is an international cooperative undertaking. 2. Measure and broadcast accurate time. 3. Determine astronomical constants and study latitude variations. 4. Observe solar surface phenomena. Study the impact of these phenomena on the Earth. The newly established high-mountain observation station in the Caucasus will make the study of the solar corona its regular work. 5. Observe stellar spectra and study stellar evolution. He expressed great pleasure at our visit. He said: The Chinese people are visiting the Pulkovo Observatory for the first time. He believed that today's meeting is of great significance to the great friendship and close cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union. He said that the unity of our two countries is of great help to consolidating peace.
    The most senior worker at the Pulkovo Observatory, Corresponding Academician Tikhov of the All-Union Academy of Sciences, also gave us a report on plants on Mars. This is an issue that everyone is interested in. Professor Tikhov came here as an intern in 1900. Director Belopolsky was his teacher. During the period when Mars approached the Earth in 1909, he used a 30-inch telescope to take photos of Mars to study the possibility of plants growing on Mars. In 1918 and 1920, he observed Mars twice more with a 15-inch telescope, still paying attention to the issue of plant survival on Mars. During the Great Patriotic War in August 1941, he went to Almaty in Central Asia to study celestial plants. This place has particularly favorable conditions for studying this issue. Why? Because the temperature on Mars is lower than on Earth. Therefore, the plants on high mountains on the ground may be more similar to the plants on Mars. Almaty has mountains that are three and a half kilometers high. The optical properties of the plants on these high mountains can be compared with the optical properties of certain parts of Mars. The plants on the Pamir Mountains and near the Arctic Circle are also good research materials.
    Everyone knows that the length of a day and night on Mars is about the same as on Earth. But the length of its four seasons is nearly twice as long as on Earth. By carefully observing Mars with an astronomical telescope, we can see that the size of the snow-covered areas at the poles of Mars increases and decreases with the winter and summer seasons. The color of the darker areas on Mars also changes with the seasons, just like the scene of plants on the ground, verdant in spring and summer, and withered and yellow in autumn and winter. But we immediately think that there are plants on Mars from this phenomenon we see, which is still somewhat arbitrary. However, if we think that Mars is farther from the sun than Earth and its temperature is much lower than Earth, and therefore it is impossible for plants to grow on Mars, this view is also inappropriate. Because plants have a great ability to adapt to the environment. Just on the ground, a plant grows on the coast of Siberia near the Arctic Ocean, and its flowers and leaves can withstand severe winters of minus 50 degrees Celsius. A type of algae in the Kamchatka hilly area grows in streams at 82 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the lower temperature on Mars cannot negate the possibility of plant growth.
    The possibility of plants growing on Mars cannot prove that there are plants on Mars. This is the same as the fact that fish can be raised in water does not prove that there are fish in the water. Professor Tikhov has done two studies on the optical phenomena of plants, which solved people's doubts about this issue, and he affirmed the existence of plants on Mars. Some people say that when taking photos of green plants on the ground in winter with films that are sensitive to infrared light, we see the phenomenon of glowing leaves in the photos, as if the trees are covered with a layer of white snow. However, when taking photos of Mars with films that are sensitive to infrared light, we do not get such results. Therefore, the conclusion is that there are no plants on Mars. Professor Tikhov studied the performance of terrestrial plants radiating infrared light. He proved that tropical plants radiate infrared light several times stronger than plants in cold regions. The surface temperature of Mars is very low, and the plants on it cannot allow infrared light to radiate out in order to maintain their heat.
    When observing terrestrial green plants with a spectrometer, a dark absorption band can usually be seen in the red region of the spectrum. This is produced by chlorophyll. Therefore, many people speculate that the spectrum formed by the light from the plant area on Mars must also have the absorption band of chlorophyll. However, the actual results of observing the spectrum disappointed these people. In order to solve this problem, Professor Tikhov turned his attention to plants in cold regions. He saw that the fir trees in Canada were blue, slightly similar to the color of the area on Mars that we think grows plants. The photos he took of the spectrum of this fir tree show that the absorption band of chlorophyll has indeed disappeared. From the study of the spectrum of fir trees in Almaty, he found that the chlorophyll absorption band is slightly more obvious in summer and very weak in winter. This powerfully proves that the reason why there is no chlorophyll absorption band in the spectrum of Mars plants is entirely due to the excessively cold climate on Mars.
    At the end of his report, Professor Tikhov said that he plans to go to South China, Tibet, and other places in China to study the optical properties of plants on high mountains. He hopes that China will develop the research of astrobiology.

    访问苏联普尔柯伐总天文台
    中国科学院访苏代表团团员　张钰哲
    普尔柯伐天文台是全苏科学院系统下的总天文台。中国科学院访苏代表团在列宁格勒的期间，全体团员四十余人，曾以一天的工夫去参观了这座全苏最大的总天文台。
    普尔柯伐天文台有着悠久的历史。它是在一七二五年彼得大帝时代创立的。最初它设立在彼得堡尼瓦河中的一个岛上。河上的雾气很重。随着彼得堡城市的发展，屋宇灯火渐渐地把天文台包围起来，妨碍了它的观测工作。所以从十八世纪末叶女皇卡德琳娜二世时代起，就有人建议把这座天文台搬到另外一个便于进行观测工作的地方。一直到一八三○年才决定将它迁移到彼得堡南郊十七公里外的普尔柯伐小山上去。到一八三九年八月，普尔柯伐天文台正式建立起来了。第一任台长维·史楚非，不但能够完成艰巨的建台任务，而且高瞻远瞩地釐订了这天文台工作的方向。它的十五吋口径的望远镜就是当时举世无匹的仪器。此外还有些子午环、中星仪和垂直环等测定经纬度的仪器。
    史楚非台长所从事的两项研究工作，正象征着天文工作的双重任务：一方面要帮助解决实际的问题，如编历授时、大地测量、航空航海等；另一方面要借着经常不断的仔细观测和钻研，来认识宇宙，了解自然。无论是测量城市的经纬度或航空航海都需要看星。但是这些星在天上的经度和纬度必须先由天文台精确地加以测定才可以利用。普尔柯伐天文台就以测定恒星的经纬度，编成星表，作为它的主要工作之一。这工作并不能一劳永逸，做一次就算了。因为恒星在天球上的位置也有微小迟缓的移动。一册星表在多年之后，上面所给的经纬度便和恒星现在所在的位置有了差异。若再根据这册星表来作测量，所得的结果，必欠准确。因此天文台里测定恒星经纬度编成星表，是一种经常性的工作。普尔柯伐天文台从一八四五年起，每隔二十年，便要刊行一册新的星表。这种编制星表的传统，到现在更加发扬光大起来。首任台长史楚非的另一种天文研究工作，是发现了几千对的天上双星，他经常地量度双星间的距离和双星间联线所指的方向。他的发现，在实际应用上一时不会起多大作用；不过在理解宇宙方面，是有它的重要意义的。万有引力定律，我们原来只晓得它能适用于地球、月亮、太阳和行星的小区域之内，但史楚非观测研究双星的结果，证实了万有引力定律同样可以适用于无远弗届的恒星空间。
    普尔柯伐天文台在建台五十周年纪念的时候，在仪器设备方面，又增添了一具三十吋口径的折光远镜——当时世界上最大的折光远镜。在别洛波尔斯基台长的领导下，这仪器便使用于发展恒星光普和视线速度的观测。许多外国天文学者，都来到这里参观、工作和学习。不过，在彼得堡进行天文观测有许多不便的地方。这里的冬季长期阴雨；由于纬度的偏北，在夏季又有长明不黑的白夜。所以到了一九零八年，在南方克里米亚半岛上斯米兹地方（它的纬度其实还在北京以北）建立了一座分台，从事于天体物理的研究工作。不久，又在乌克兰的南部建立了一座研究方位天文的分台。
    十月社会主义革命以后，普尔柯伐天文台的工作有了更大的发展。此时所增添的仪器里，有一具巨大水平式的观日仪。克里米亚的分台，也修建起一具直径一公尺的反光远镜。普尔柯伐天文台的工作计划性开始加强了。遇着重大问题它便联合全苏其他天文台共同解决。例如为了协助进行大地测量和地图测绘的工作，普尔柯伐天文台便集合了五个天文台的力量参加观测编制一部包含有三千颗恒星经纬度的大地测量星表的工作。这次集体工作的成功，鼓舞了普尔柯伐天文台再一次发动其它天文台参加观测微星和编制微星星表的工作。按照这个计划，参加观测的天文台，增加到七个之多。需要观测的恒星包括了将近两万颗肉眼所不能直接看到的微星。大地测量星表是为了增进测定地面经纬的精确度，着重于实际的应用，而微星星表编制的目的，便是为了满足恒星天文学研究上的需求，要在星空间建立起准确的方向系统。
    但是当这伟大计划开始付诸实施的时候，第二次世界大战爆发了。希特勒的军队为了打击苏联工业的中心，便向着列宁格勒进犯。普尔柯伐天文台恰好处于战争的最前线。虽然全台的工作人员和红军一起，曾将贵重仪器和一些图书迁往安全地带；但是大远镜和大部分图书，在仓促之间来不及迁移。这些研究的设备以及普尔柯伐山上的建筑物，全部毁于德寇的炮火。当一九四五年苏联科学院庆祝成立二百二十周年的时候，许多苏联的和外国的学者都来到普尔柯伐山上，凭吊被德寇所摧毁的天文台。这里已是蔓草荒烟，碎瓦颓垣，和其他经过战火的堡垒竟没有任何分别。
    苏联政府对于普尔柯伐天文台的恢复工作是非常重视的。当战争尚未结束的时候，苏联政府便已决定重修普尔柯伐天文台。这个重修计划不但要求恢复普尔柯伐天文台的旧观，而且还要扩充它。准备安装的新仪器，全由苏联国家工厂自行制造。今年三月二十七日我们访苏代表团到普尔柯伐天文台去参观的时候，这重建新台的工作已经是基本上完成了。
    我们访问普尔柯伐天文台时，副台长兹维列夫给我们介绍了普尔柯伐天文台的历史，给我们放映了普尔柯伐天文台被德寇破坏情状的幻灯片。又把许多重建后的天文台新仪器的照片，给大家传观，并给我们介绍了现在的工作情况。他说：目前普尔柯伐天文台工作的主要项目，可分为五类。一、以目视及摄影方法，测定微星座标及编制星表。这是一宗国际合作的事业。二、测定并播送准确时刻。三、测定天文常数，研究纬度变移。四、观测太阳表面现象。研究这些现象对于地球所起的影响。在高加索新建立的高山观测站，便以研究太阳周围的日冕为它的经常工作。五、观测恒星光谱，研究星体演化问题。他对我们的访问表示非常高兴。他说：中国人民还是初次到普尔柯伐天文台来参观。他相信今天的会面，对中苏两国人民的伟大友谊和密切合作有重要意义。他说，我们两国的团结，对于巩固和平有极大的帮助。
    普尔柯伐天文台资格最老的工作者，全苏科学院通讯院士齐霍夫也给我们作了关于火星上的植物的报告。这是大家共同感到兴趣的问题。齐霍夫教授在一九○○年，便来此任实习员。别洛波尔斯基台长，就是他的老师。一九○九年火星接近地球的时期，他曾以三十吋口径的远镜拍摄火星的照片，目的在研究火星上生长植物的可能性。一九一八年及一九二○年，他又曾两度以十五吋口径的远镜观测火星，所注意的仍然是火星植物生存问题。一九四一年八月伟大卫国战争期间，他到了中央亚细亚的阿拉木图研究天体植物。这个地方对于这种问题的研究，具备了特别有利的条件。为什么呢？因为火星的温度比地球低。所以地面高山上的植物就可能和火星上的植物有较为类似的地方。阿拉木图有三公里半的高山。这高山上的植物的光学性质，便可以拿来和火星上的某些部分的光学性质相比较。帕米尔高山上和北极圈附近的植物，也都是很好的研究资料。
    大家都知道火星上一昼夜的长短和地球差不多。但是它一年四季之长，就将近于地球上两年的时间。用天文远镜仔细地观测火星，可以看到火星两极积雪区域的大小，随着冬夏而消长。火星上较暗部分的颜色，也随着季节变化，恰似地上植物，春夏苍翠，秋冬枯黄的景状。但是我们从所看到的这一点现象，便立刻认为火星上有植物存在，还未免武断。但是，如果以为火星离太阳比地球远，温度比地球低得多，便认为火星上不可能生长植物，这种看法也不妥当。因为植物有很大的适应环境的能力。就在地面说吧，西伯利亚靠北冰洋的海岸生长着一种植物，它的花和叶可以耐过摄氏零下五十度的严冬。堪察加丘陵地带有一种水藻生长在摄氏八十二度的小溪中。所以火星温度较低，并不能抹煞植物生长的可能性。
    火星上有植物生长的可能性，还不能证明火星上有植物存在。这如同水里可以养鱼，并不能证明水里就有鱼是同样的道理。齐霍夫教授曾经作了两种关于植物的光学现象的研究，解决了人们对于这问题的怀疑，他肯定了火星上植物的存在。有的人说，用能感红外光线的底片拍摄地面冬季绿色植物的照片，我们在照片上便看到树叶发光的现象，好像树上蒙罩着一层白雪。不过用能感红外光的底片，对着火星摄影，就得不到这样的结果。因此得出结论说火星上没有植物。齐霍夫教授研究了地面植物放射红外光的性能。他证明热带植物所放射的红外光，比寒带的植物，要强好几倍。火星表面温度很低，它上面的植物为着保持自己的热量，便不能容许红外光放射发散出去了。
    用光谱仪来观测地面绿色植物，通常在光谱红色区域间可以看到一条阴暗的吸收带。这是由叶绿素所产生的。因此很多人推测火星上有植物区域射来光线所形成的光谱，必定也会有叶绿素的吸收带。然而实际观测光谱的结果，却令这些人失望。为着要解决这个问题，齐霍夫教授又把他的注意力转到严寒地区的植物上面去。他看加拿大的枞树，呈现蓝色，略同于火星上我们认为生长植物地区的色彩。他所拍摄的这种枞树光谱的照片，显示着其中叶绿素的吸收带，确实已经消失。从阿拉木图的枞树光谱的研究，他发现叶绿素吸收带，夏天稍为显著，冬天便非常微弱。这有力地证明火星植物的光谱里，所以没有叶绿素吸收带的原因，也完全是由于火星上气候过于寒冷的缘故。
    齐霍夫教授在结束他这篇报告的时候说，他计划到中国的华南、西藏等地方，来研究高山上植物的光学性质。他希望中国发展天体生物学的研究。
