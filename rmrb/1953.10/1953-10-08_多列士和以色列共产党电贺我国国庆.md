Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, congratulating him on China's National Day. The telegram reads as follows: To Chairman Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

    On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, on behalf of the French working class and the French people, extends warm congratulations to the great Chinese people, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and the glorious Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. The tremendous achievements made by the Chinese people in their struggle for a new life, the great example they have set for the oppressed people of all countries who yearn for liberation, and the fraternal assistance to the Korean people who are resisting the aggression of the imperialist warmongers, are effective contributions to consolidating the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. The economic, cultural, and political cooperation between China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a model for all peace-loving and freedom-loving nations. From now on, it is impossible to decide on major world issues without China. The Central Committee of the French Communist Party sincerely hopes that the great Chinese people will achieve new successes. The Central Committee of the French Communist Party assures you, dear comrades, that the French Communists and democrats will do their utmost to promote the restoration of normal relations between France and the People's Republic of China.
    Long live the glorious fourth anniversary of the victory of the Chinese people!
    Long live peace!
            Central Committee of the French Communist Party
                General Secretary Maurice Thorez
