    Nanchang County Grain Bureau Should Quickly Resolve the Transportation Problem of Grain Purchased by Cooperatives
    Hu Qingguang from Nanchang Purchasing and Marketing Station of Jiangxi Provincial Cooperative Federation writes: Nanchang County cooperatives overfulfilled the state's entrusted task of purchasing rice in July and August. In September, due to the increased amount of purchase, the cooperatives were often forced to stop purchasing due to insufficient storage capacity. Although the contract between the cooperatives and the Grain Bureau clearly stipulates: "Transport should be done immediately after purchase. In areas with transportation difficulties, cooperatives can find civilian houses for temporary storage, with each batch not exceeding fifteen to twenty days." However, the Grain Bureau did not pay attention to this provision and consistently adopted a dilatory and perfunctory attitude towards the transportation of rice purchased by the cooperative purchasing points. In August, the Taizidian purchasing point had to put the purchased rice in the open air because of insufficient warehouse space; because the Grain Bureau failed to accelerate transportation according to the requirements of the cooperative, it was forced to stop purchasing for five days. Similar phenomena occurred at the Dacheng purchasing point. However, the leaders of the Grain Bureau did not pay attention to this situation, which led to the problem becoming more and more serious. At present, the amount of purchase at the purchasing points in Dacheng, Maqiu, Jiangxiang, Luojiaji, Taizidian, Jingkou, Yelou, Wufeng and other places in Nanchang County has exceeded the storage capacity of the cooperative warehouses by four to five times or more. A lot of rice has to be stored in dilapidated houses, temples, or schools. The Ninth District Cooperative even dismantled counters to load grain. Some cooperatives had to pile the grain in the open air using sun mats. The Nanchang County Cooperative has repeatedly requested instructions from the County Finance and Economic Committee, the Prefectural Finance and Economic Committee, the Prefectural Grain Bureau, the Special Zone Grain Purchasing Office, and the Provincial Grain Purchasing Office, and notified the County Grain Bureau to quickly resolve the transportation problem. The reply from the Prefectural Grain Bureau was "think of a solution immediately"; however, after dragging on for more than ten days, the transportation problem was still not resolved. The leading organs also did not approve the issue of reimbursement of storage fees requested by the cooperatives. According to our recent inspection, some of the rice stored in the open air at some purchasing points has begun to mold at the bottom because of the long storage time, but the Grain Bureau turns a blind eye to it. I think this wrong attitude towards grain purchasing work is absolutely intolerable.
    These problems urgently need to be resolved. If the Grain Bureau does not take emergency measures to deal with them in a timely manner, not only will the grain purchasing task not be completed, but a batch of grain will suffer losses. We request the assistance of higher-level leading organs to quickly resolve this problem.

### 南昌县粮食局应该迅速解决合作社收购粮食的调运问题

    南昌县粮食局应该迅速解决合作社收购粮食的调运问题
    江西省合作总社南昌收购推销站胡庆光来信：南昌县合作社七、八月份超额完成了国家委托收购稻谷的任务。九月份由于收购的数量增大，合作社在收购中往往因仓容不足而被迫停购。合作社与粮食局所订合同中虽然明文规定：“随收随运，运输上较困难的地区，合作社可代为寻找民房保管，保管期间每批不得超过十五至二十天。”但是粮食局并没有重视这项规定，对合作社代购点收购稻谷的运输问题一贯采取拖拉敷衍态度。八月间太子殿收购点因为仓库不够，收购的稻谷只好摆在露天地里；因为粮食局不能根据合作社的要求加速调运，结果只得被迫停购五天。大成收购点也有类似现象发生。但是粮食局领导人对这一情况并不重视，以致问题愈来愈严重。目前，南昌县大成、麻丘、蒋巷、罗家集、太子殿、泾口、叶楼、五丰等地收购点收购数量都已超过合作社仓库容量四、五倍以上。很多稻谷只得借用破屋烂庙或学校保存。九区合作社甚至拆柜台来装谷。有些合作社只好用晒垫把谷子堆放在露天。南昌县合作社曾多次请示县财政经济委员会、专署财政经济委员会、专署粮食局、专区购粮办公室、省购粮办公室，并通知县粮食局迅速解决调运问题。专署粮食局的答复是“马上想办法解决”；但是拖延了十多天，调运问题仍然没有解决。合作社要求报销保管费用的问题，领导机关也不作批复。据我们最近检查，有些收购点露天储存的稻谷，因为储存时间较久，底层开始发霉，而粮食局却视若无睹。这种对待收粮工作的错误态度，我认为是绝对不能容忍的。
    以上这些问题急待解决。如果粮食局再不采取紧急措施及时处理，不但购粮任务无法完成，而且将有一批粮食遭受损失。我们要求上级领导机关协助我们迅速解决这个问题。
