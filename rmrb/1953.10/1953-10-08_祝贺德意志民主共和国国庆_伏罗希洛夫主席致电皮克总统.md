    Congratulations on the National Day of the German Democratic Republic
    Chairman Voroshilov Sends Telegram to President Pieck
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th] TASS, Moscow, 7th: K.Y. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, sent a telegram to Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, congratulating him on the National Day of the German Democratic Republic. The telegram reads as follows:
    On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, Comrade President, please accept the sincere congratulations of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and myself, and wish the German people success in their efforts to build a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany.
    For the benefit of our two peoples and the strengthening of world peace, may the friendship between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic continue to strengthen and develop.
    Chairman Malenkov Sends Telegram to Prime Minister Grotewohl
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th] TASS, Moscow, 7th: G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, sent a telegram to Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, congratulating him on the fourth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. The telegram reads as follows:
    On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, please accept my warm congratulations, esteemed Prime Minister, and the Government of the German Democratic Republic.
    Four years ago, the progressive patriotic forces of the German people undertook the lofty mission of safeguarding the unity, freedom, and independence of the motherland, and ensuring that Germany develops along a peaceful, democratic path, and along the path of friendly cooperation with other countries. German patriots are increasingly aware that the policy of reviving German militarism pursued by the aggressive bloc poses a great threat to Germany. The purpose of this policy is to eliminate the possibility of a unified Germany and turn Germany into a hotbed for a third world war. The peaceful policy pursued by the German Democratic Republic is a manifestation of the national consciousness of the German people. The German Democratic Republic is a reliable fortress for all peace-loving Germans.
    The historically significant act of establishing the German Democratic Republic is in the interests of the German people and all peace-loving people who are striving to strengthen European and international security. Progressive humanity believes that further strengthening the German Democratic Republic is an important condition for a final solution to the German question for the sake of peace and international security.
    The Soviet people hope that the German people will achieve victory in the work of restoring the unification of the motherland and building a peaceful Germany. In the just struggle for a unified, independent, peaceful, and democratic Germany, the German people will always receive the sympathy and support of the Soviet people.
    Foreign Minister Molotov Sends Telegram to Foreign Minister Bolz
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th] TASS, Moscow, 7th: Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov sent a telegram to L. Bolz, Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, congratulating him on the National Day of the German Democratic Republic. The telegram reads as follows:

    Please also accept my heartfelt congratulations to the German people, and I sincerely hope that the German people will achieve success in realizing their national aspirations—in accordance with the interests of peace and international security, re-establishing a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany.

    祝贺德意志民主共和国国庆
    伏罗希洛夫主席致电皮克总统
      【新华社七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席克·叶·伏罗希洛夫致电德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克，祝贺德意志民主共和国国庆。电文如下：
    值此德意志民主共和国建国四周年纪念，总统同志，请接受苏联最高苏维埃主席团和我个人的诚挚的祝贺，并祝德国人民在建立统一、和平、民主的德国的努力中获得成功。
    为了我们两国人民的利益和加强世界和平，愿苏联和德意志民主共和国之间的友谊不断加强与发展。
    马林科夫主席致电格罗提渥总理
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫致电德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥，祝贺德意志民主共和国成立四周年。电文如下：
    值此德意志民主共和国建国四周年纪念，请你，可敬的总理以及德意志民主共和国政府，接受我的热诚祝贺。
    四年前，德国人民中的进步爱国力量承担了维护祖国的统一、自由与独立，和保证德国沿着和平、民主的道路、沿着与其他国家友好合作的道路发展的崇高使命。德国爱国者一天比一天清楚地认识到，侵略集团所奉行的复活德国军国主义的政策造成了对德国的巨大威胁，这种政策的目的，是消除统一德国的可能性，把德国变成第三次世界大战的温床。德意志民主共和国奉行的和平政策是德国人民民族觉悟的表现。德意志民主共和国是所有维护和平的德国人的可靠堡垒。
    建立德意志民主共和国这个具有历史意义的举动，是符合于德国人民的利益以及正在为加强欧洲和国际安全而努力的所有爱好和平人民的利益的。进步人类认为，进一步加强德意志民主共和国是为了和平与国际安全来最后解决德国问题的一个重要条件。
    苏联人民希望德国人民在恢复祖国的统一并建立一个和平的德国的工作中取得胜利。在争取一个统一、独立、和平、民主的德国的正义斗争中，德国人民将始终得到苏联人民的同情和支持。

    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫致电德意志民主共和国外交部长洛·博尔茨，祝贺德意志民主共和国国庆。电文如下：
