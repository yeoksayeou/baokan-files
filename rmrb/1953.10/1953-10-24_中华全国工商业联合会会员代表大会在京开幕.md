Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The National Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce opened in the capital on the 23rd.

A total of 640 delegates are participating in this congress. They represent different economic components. Some represent socialist economic components such as state-owned enterprises, some represent semi-socialist cooperatives, some represent joint state-private enterprises, some represent handicrafts, stallholders, and capitalist agents, and some are specially invited representatives with close ties to industry and commerce. Private industrialists and merchants account for the vast majority (including various forms of state capitalist enterprises other than joint state-private enterprises). Through this congress, the delegates will clarify the general line of the state during the transition period in their understanding, and discuss how private industrialists and merchants, following the goal of the state's general line, can gradually move onto the path of state capitalism and correctly play an active role. This congress will conclude the preparatory work of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and establish the formal All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.

Guests attending today's meeting included: Dong Biwu, Vice Premier of the State Council of the Central People's Government; Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association; Luo Longji, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League; Wang Shaoao, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy; Luo Renyi, representative of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party; Yan Xichun, member of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party; Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society; Chen Bingji, representative of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League; Dai Qian of the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government; Gan Chunlei, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government; and Ji Chaoding, Secretary-General of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, among others.

The congress opened at 2:00 p.m. The list of the presidium of the congress was adopted, and Sha Qianli was elected as the secretary-general of the congress, and Huang Jieran as the deputy secretary-general. Chen Shutong, Chairman of the Congress, delivered an opening speech entitled "Striving to Implement the State's General Line and Correctly Play the Active Role of Private Industry and Commerce." After explaining the nature and tasks of the congress, he described the brilliant victories achieved by the state in various fields over the past four years and the basic tasks of the state entering the period of the first five-year plan. Then, he analyzed the important significance of private industry and commerce gradually undergoing socialist transformation through state capitalism. He said that in the past few years, state capitalist economy has already taken forms such as joint state-private ownership, processing, ordering, state purchasing, exclusive sales, and agency purchase and sales. These forms are beneficial to both the state and industrialists and merchants. The state can strengthen its leadership over private industry and commerce through state capitalism, and more importantly, it can gradually bring enterprises into the orbit of state planning and prepare favorable conditions for a steady transition to socialism in the future. Private enterprises can accelerate their transformation through state capitalism, reduce blindness and destructiveness, and enable private industrialists and merchants to concentrate on improving the operation and management of their enterprises and obtain reasonable profits.

Regarding how private industrialists and merchants should implement the state's general line, Chairman Chen Shutong offered five suggestions. First, under the leadership of the People's Government and the state-owned economy, they should correctly play their due role, strive to operate enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, abide by the provisions of the Common Program, accept the supervision of the working masses, actively improve operation and management, and strive to gradually move onto the path of state capitalism. Second, they should respond to the government's call and launch an increase production and practice economy campaign in private enterprises. Third, they should obey market management, oppose speculation and profiteering, and, under the leadership of state-owned commerce, carry out the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and do a good job in the state's entrusted purchase and sales work. Fourth, they should guarantee tax revenue, assist the government in preventing tax evasion and fight against illegal acts of tax evasion. Fifth, they should strengthen learning, strengthen patriotic education, see clearly the great and bright future of the motherland, and combine learning with production and operation so that actions meet the requirements of the Common Program. Chen Shutong called on far-sighted key figures in the industrial and commercial circles to play a leading role in striving to implement the state's general line in the transition period. Finally, he asked industrialists and merchants to unite around Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, to strive for the gradual realization of the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, and to strive for the correct play of the active role of private industrialists and merchants.

Also addressing the conference were: Dong Biwu, Vice Premier of the State Council, Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association. (The above speeches will be published separately, see page two)

Sha Qianli, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, made a work report of the Preparatory Committee to the conference, and Xiang Shuxiang made a financial report of the Preparatory Committee.

    中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会在京开幕
    据新华社讯：中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会二十三日在首都开幕了。
    参加这次大会的代表，共六百四十人。他们代表着不同经济成份。有的代表社会主义经济成份的国营企业，有的代表半社会主义性质的合作社，有的代表公私合营企业，有的代表手工业、摊商和资本家代理人，有的是与工商界有密切关系的特邀代表，其中私营工商业代表占绝大比重（在这里，包括公私合营以外各种形式的国家资本主义企业）。代表们将通过这次大会，在认识上把国家在过渡时期中的总路线明确起来，并将就私营工商业者在遵循国家总路线的目标下，如何逐步走上国家资本主义轨道，如何正确地发挥积极作用的有关问题进行研讨。这次大会将结束全国工商业联合会的筹备工作，成立正式的全国工商业联合会。
    参加今天会议的来宾有：中央人民政府政务院副总理董必武，中共中央统一战线工作部部长李维汉，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席李济深，中华全国总工会主席赖若愚，中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培，中国民主同盟副主席罗隆基，中国民主促进会副主席王却尘，中国农工民主党代表罗任一，中国致公党中央委员严希纯，九三学社主席许德珩，台湾民主自治同盟代表陈炳基，中央人民政府劳动部戴谦，中央民族事务委员会办公厅副主任甘春雷，中国国际贸易促进委员会秘书长冀朝鼎等。
    下午二时，大会开幕。通过了大会主席团名单，并推选沙千里为大会秘书长，黄玠然为副秘书长。大会主席陈叔通向大会作了题为“为实行国家总路线、正确地发挥私营工商业的积极作用而奋斗”的开幕词。他在说明这次大会的性质、任务后，叙述了四年来国家在各个方面所取得的辉煌胜利及国家进入第一个五年计划建设时期的基本任务。接着，他又分析了私营工商业通过国家资本主义逐步进行社会主义改造的重要意义。他说，过去几年来国家资本主义经济已经有公私合营、加工、订货、统购、包销以及代购代销等形式。这几种形式对国家与工商业者都是有利的。国家可以通过国家资本主义加强对私营工商业的领导，而更重要的是可以逐步将企业纳入国家计划的轨道，并为将来稳步过渡到社会主义准备了有利的条件。私营企业则可以通过国家资本主义方式，加速自己的改造，减少盲目性与破坏性，使私营工商业者专心致志地改善企业的经营管理，并获得合理的利润。
    关于私营工商业者如何实行国家总路线，陈叔通主席提供了五点意见。第一、应该在人民政府和国营经济领导下，正确地发挥应有的作用，努力经营有利于国计民生的企业，遵守共同纲领的规定，接受工人群众的监督，积极改善经营管理，争取逐步走上国家资本主义的轨道。第二、要响应政府的号召，展开私营企业中的增产节约运动。第三、应该服从市场管理，反对投机套购，并在国营商业的领导之下开展城乡物资交流，做好国家委托的代购代销工作。第四、要保证税收，协助政府防止偷税漏税并向偷税漏税的不法行为进行斗争。第五、要加强学习，加强爱国主义教育，看清祖国的远大光明的前途，要将学习和生产经营结合起来，使行动符合于共同纲领的要求。陈叔通号召眼光远大的工商界骨干分子，在为实行国家在过渡时期的总路线而努力中起带头作用。最后他要求工商业者团结在毛主席与中国共产党周围，为着逐步实现私营工商业的社会主义改造，为着正确地发挥私营工商业者积极作用而奋斗。
    在大会上致词的还有：政务院副总理董必武，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席李济深，中华全国总工会主席赖若愚，中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培。（以上致词另发，见第二版）
    原中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会秘书长沙千里向大会作了筹备委员会工作报告，项叔翔作了筹备委员会的财务报告。
    大会通过了中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会议事规则、议事日程及提案审查、起草、财务审查等委员会组织规程和委员名单。大会为了纪念中国人民志愿军出国作战三周年，感谢志愿军在保卫祖国、援助朝鲜和保卫远东及世界和平中的巨大贡献，在热烈的掌声中通过了给中国人民志愿军致敬电，同时，通过了给朝鲜人民军金日成元帅的祝贺电。
