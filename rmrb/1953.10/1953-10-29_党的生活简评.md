A Brief Review of Party Life

    Combining the Political Enthusiasm of the Masses with Scientific Management

    In a modern enterprise, it is necessary to combine the political enthusiasm of the masses with scientific management to complete the production plan comprehensively and evenly. If the enterprise's guiding ideology is biased, either neglecting management work and mistakenly believing that a mass movement detached from scientific management can complete the plan, or mistakenly believing that a so-called scientific management system detached from the masses can do a good job in production without mobilizing the masses, the result will be that the production plan cannot be completed well. It is precisely because the Tangshan Steel Plant's Party Committee criticized the above two erroneous ideas and established a correct guiding ideology that it strengthened the political and ideological leadership over planning and management work, enabling the strengthening of planning and management work to achieve relatively significant achievements.

    To complete the national plan, it is necessary to mobilize the masses and rely on the millions of creative efforts of the masses. However, there are also situations where some factories and mines have also mobilized the masses, and the masses have also produced many valuable inventions and creations, but the production plan has not been completed well. Why? Is it that the masses were not mobilized well? Is it that the inventions and creations of the masses do not solve the problem? Neither is the case. The problem lies in: not mobilizing the masses to establish and improve a scientific management system, not mobilizing the masses to carry out production using scientific methods, and not concentrating the enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses on the key issues of production, resulting in the waste of the wisdom of the masses and the inability of the creativity of the masses to be fully utilized. There are many, many such lessons. However, some Party workers, especially some cadres who have just transferred to enterprises not long ago, are not good at combining the political enthusiasm of the masses with scientific management because they have not been exposed to scientific and modern large enterprises in the past. After the increase production and practice economy campaign was launched, some factories and mines still only paid attention to blindly mobilizing the masses, but were not good at combining labor competition with the establishment and improvement of planning and management work. The Party organizations of these factories and mines should first correct this bias from the leadership's ideology.

    However, if it is believed that a scientific management system can be established without mobilizing the masses, or if it is believed that as long as the scientific management systems of other advanced factories and mines are copied, mobilizing the masses will be relaxed and political and ideological work will be neglected, the result will also be that production cannot proceed smoothly. The situation of the Tangshan Steel Plant illustrates this problem very well. When the Tangshan Steel Plant's planning and management work did not yet have a mass base, the result of its implementation was: "The plan is inaccurate, the workers do not understand, and execution is impossible." Because any scientific management methods and systems in an enterprise must rely on all employees to establish and implement them. Otherwise, it can only become a dead letter. When correcting the ideas in neglecting management work, the Party organization in the enterprise must also pay attention to preventing and correcting the occurrence and development of this bias.

    党的生活简评
    把群众的政治热情和科学管理结合起来
    在现代化的企业里，必须把群众的政治热情和科学的管理结合起来，才能全面地均衡地完成生产计划。企业的领导思想如果有所偏废，或者是轻视管理工作，错误地认为只要掀起一个脱离科学管理的群众运动就可以完成计划；或者错误地认为只要有了一套脱离群众的所谓科学管理制度，用不着去发动群众，也可以搞好生产，其结果都会使生产计划不能很好地完成。唐山钢厂党委正是因为批判了上述两种错误思想，树立了正确的领导思想，才加强了对计划管理工作的政治思想领导，使加强计划管理工作获得比较显著的成就。
    要完成国家计划，必须要发动群众，要依靠群众的千千万万的创造。但是，也有这种情况，有些厂矿也发动了群众，群众也出现了许多可贵的发明创造，但是，生产计划却并没有很好地完成。为什么呢？是群众发动得不好吗？是群众的发明创造不解决问题吗？都不是。问题在于：没有发动群众来建立和健全科学的管理制度，没有发动群众用科学的方法来进行生产，没有把群众的热情和智慧集中在生产的关键问题上去，以致浪费了群众的智慧，使群众的创造不能充分发挥作用。这样的教训是很多很多的。但是，有些党的工作人员，特别是有些刚刚转入企业不久的干部，因为他们过去没有接触过科学的近代化的大企业，因而不善于把群众的政治热情和科学的管理结合起来。在增产节约竞赛展开以后，有些厂矿仍然只去注意盲目地发动群众，而不善于把劳动竞赛和建立和健全计划管理工作结合起来，这些厂矿的党组织应该首先从领导思想上来纠正这种偏向。
    但是如果认为不发动群众就可以建立起一套什么科学的管理制度，或者认为只要搬用其他先进厂矿的科学管理制度，就放松发动群众忽视政治思想工作，其结果同样会使生产不能顺利进行。唐山钢厂的情况很好地说明了这个问题。当唐山钢厂的计划管理工作还没有群众基础时，执行的结果就是：“计划不准，工人不懂，执行不通”。因为企业中的任何科学的管理方法和制度，都必须依靠全体职工来建立和实行。否则，只能成为一纸空文。企业中的党组织在纠正忽视管理工作中的思想时，必须同时注意防止和纠正这种偏向的发生和发展。
