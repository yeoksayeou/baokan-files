Some factories, mines, enterprises, and basic construction departments only pay attention to increasing production in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, while neglecting the work of practicing strict economy.

According to the reflection from the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry: Some leading cadres in enterprises under the Ministry personally take charge when formulating production increase plans, but turn a blind eye to conservation; some push it to the finance department to calculate and report. This phenomenon is even more common in basic construction departments, where financial management is chaotic, and budgets and final accounts cannot be made. They think there is no way to save money, and do not actively reduce construction and installation costs from aspects such as saving raw materials that should be saved, rationally organizing labor, and promoting advanced construction experience and advanced technology, so as to save funds for the country. Except for the Petroleum Administration Bureau, which requires its basic construction units to save 3% or 7% of construction costs, other basic construction departments such as coal mines, power industry, and hydropower construction have not put forward strict requirements for saving.

Some factories in Shenyang City have quite serious waste in production, but they did not pay attention to changing this situation in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. Half of the self-made tools of Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory were wasted due to poor management in the first half of the year. Not long ago, when the construction office inspected the tool supply work, it was found that foreign purchased tools worth 1.1 to 1.2 billion yuan were stockpiled because the factory could not use them (now sold). In August, the factory saved more than 300 million yuan by revising only a few raw material quotas, which shows that there is a lot of waste in the factory's production. However, when the factory formulated the plan to increase production and practice economy this time, it only focused on increasing the production of 41 lathes to complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy of 13 billion yuan, and did not actively try to save raw materials and reduce defective products. There is a lot of waste in the production of various mechanical and electrical factories in Shenyang. In August, seven factories including the Mining Machinery Factory wasted 130,546 man-hours due to equipment accidents, intermittent working hours, and other reasons, which is equivalent to more than 650 workers not producing for a month. The defective product rate of the seven factories generally accounted for 8% to 18%. However, the factories have not generally paid attention to correcting this waste.

Some industrial and mining enterprises and units have paid attention to saving, but only focused on some small administrative expenses, and did not first overcome the serious waste in production. For example, Benxi Coal Mine only paid attention to some minor problems when formulating the savings plan, and ignored the serious waste phenomena that have long existed in production, such as low coal recovery rate and large waste of pit props. In addition, some individual factories even tried to reduce workers' welfare facilities, stipulating that workers should pay 1,000 yuan for registration fees when seeing a doctor, and stipulating that comrades from higher-level agencies who go to work in the factory should pay rent; some factories in Shanxi proposed to save employees' medical expenses, and even mistakenly proposed to save money by "tightening their belts."

Such practices of neglecting saving or not practicing strict economy from a positive perspective are all wrong, and the leading comrades of each unit should quickly correct this deviation.

### 部分厂矿在增产节约运动中忽视节约工作

    部分厂矿在增产节约运动中忽视节约工作
    部分厂矿企业和基本建设部门在增产节约中只是注意增产，忽视厉行节约的工作。
    据中央燃料工业部的反映：该部所属企业有些领导干部在制订增产计划时都是亲自动手，而对节约则不闻不问；有的推给财务部门去计算一下就上报。基本建设部门这种现象更加普遍，财务管理混乱，预决算做不出来，就认为没法子节约，而不去从节约应该节约的原材料、合理组织劳动力、推广先进的施工经验和先进技术等方面积极降低建筑安装成本，为国家节约资金。除石油管理总局对所属基本建设单位提出要节约施工费用投资的百分之三或百分之七的要求外，其他煤矿、电业、水电建设等基本建设部门都没有提出严格的节约要求。
    沈阳市有些工厂在生产上存在着相当严重的浪费现象，但他们在增产节约运动中并没有注意去改变这种情况。沈阳第一机床厂上半年自制的工具由于管理不善，浪费了三分之一。不久前施工室检查工具供应工作时，发现有价值十一、二亿元的外购工具因为本厂不能使用，而被积压着（现已卖出）。八月份该厂只修订了几项原材料定额，便节约了三亿多元，这都说明该厂生产中的浪费现象是不少的。但该厂此次订增产节约计划时只是偏重于增产四十一台车床，来完成增产节约一百三十亿元的任务，而没有积极设法节省原材料和减少废品。沈阳机械电工各厂生产上的浪费都很大，矿山机械厂等七个厂在八月份生产中，由于设备事故、间断工时以及其他方面的原因，即浪费了十三万零五百四十六个工时，等于六百五十多名工人一个月没有生产，七个厂加工废品率一般占百分之八到百分之十八。但是，各厂还没有普遍注意去纠正这种浪费现象。
    也有些工矿企业单位虽然注意了节约，但却只是着眼于一些细碎的行政费用的开支，而没有首先去克服生产中的严重浪费现象。如本溪煤矿在订节约计划时，只注意些小问题，而忽视了生产中早已存在的煤的回收率低、坑木浪费大等严重浪费现象。另外，也有个别工厂甚至从减少工人福利设施上来打主意，规定工人看病要付一千元挂号费，规定上级机关下厂工作的同志要付房租费；山西有些厂提出节省职工医药费，甚至错误地提出以“勒裤带”的办法来节约。
    这种忽视节约或不从积极方面厉行节约的做法，都是错误的，各单位的领导同志应该迅速纠正这种偏向。
