Xinhua News Agency, Washington: TASS reports from Washington: The so-called "Mutual Defense" Treaty concluded between the United States and South Korea was signed in Washington on October 1. This treaty, drafted in Seoul ten days after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, gives the United States the right to station land, sea, and air forces in South Korea indefinitely. This treaty consolidates South Korea's position as a bridgehead and colony of the United States.

Although U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said at the signing ceremony of this treaty that the treaty signed with Syngman Rhee was a "contribution to peace," it is quite obvious that this military alliance is aggressive and aims to undermine the peaceful settlement of the Korean question.

    美李军事条约在华盛顿签字
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社华盛顿讯：美国与南朝鲜缔结的所谓“共同防御”条约已于十月一日在华盛顿签字。朝鲜停战协定签字后十天在汉城拟定的这一条约，使美国有权无限期地在南朝鲜驻留陆海空军。这一条约巩固了南朝鲜作为美国的一个桥头堡和殖民地的地位。
    尽管美国国务卿杜勒斯在这个条约举行签字仪式时说，和李承晚签订的这一条约是什么“对和平的贡献”，但十分明显，这种军事同盟是侵略性的，其目的在于破坏朝鲜问题的和平解决。
