    The United Middle School of Yingde County, Guangdong Province, Should Not Waste Remaining Building Materials

    Qiu Ye from the People's Government of Yingde County, Guangdong Province, writes: The expansion project of the United Middle School of Yingde County, Guangdong Province, was completed in April this year, leaving more than 900 fir timbers, more than 20,000 catties of lime, and more than 20,000 bricks. Because the school did not properly store these remaining materials, they have suffered great losses. The fir timbers were piled on the hillside behind the school, exposed to rain and sun, and some have begun to rot. More than 20,000 catties of lime were piled in the open air and have been soaked by rain, causing them to deteriorate and become ineffective. More than 4,000 bricks unloaded on the bank of the Yingde City River have mostly been washed away by floods, and some have been covered by river sand or submerged in water. Local people have raised objections to the school several times, suggesting that these materials be disposed of quickly. However, the school has been procrastinating and ignoring the problem. The United Middle School of Yingde County's attitude of not cherishing the people's property is very wrong and should be corrected immediately.

    广东英德县联合中学不应浪费剩余建筑材料
    广东省英德县人民政府秋野来信：广东省英德县联合中学扩建校舍工程在今年四月完工，剩余杉木九百余根、石灰二万余斤、红砖二万余块。这批剩余材料，因为学校没有很好保管，现在已受到很大损失。杉木被堆放在学校后面的山坡上，任凭雨淋日晒，已有一部分开始腐烂。二万余斤石灰露天堆放，已被雨水打湿而变质失效。卸在英德城河岸上的四千多块红砖，大部已被洪水冲走，还有一些已被河沙盖着或浸在水中。当地群众曾向该校提过几次意见，建议迅速处理这些材料。但该校却一直拖延不管。英德县联合中学这种不爱护人民财产的态度是十分错误的，应该迅速纠正。
