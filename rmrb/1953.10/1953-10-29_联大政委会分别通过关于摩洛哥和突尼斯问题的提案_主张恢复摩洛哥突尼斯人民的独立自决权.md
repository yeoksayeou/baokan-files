Xinhua News Agency, New York, 27th: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee voted on the proposal regarding the Tunisian issue, put forward by thirteen Arab and Asian countries, on the morning of the 26th.

The committee passed the preamble to the thirteen-nation proposal and, by a vote of 32 in favor, 19 against, and 5 abstentions, adopted a draft recommendation recommending that "all necessary steps be taken to ensure that the Tunisian people exercise their full autonomy and right to independence."

However, the committee rejected the following specific recommendations: that the martial law promulgated in Tunisia be repealed, that civil liberties be restored, and that negotiations be immediately conducted with representatives of the Tunisian government formed through universal suffrage, so that the Tunisian people can exercise their full rights. Thus, the most important recommendations aimed at justly resolving the Tunisian issue were removed from the thirteen-nation proposal.

This revised thirteen-nation proposal, when put to a vote as a whole, received 29 votes in favor, 22 against, and 5 abstentions.

The Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted in favor of every article of the proposal. The United States delegation voted against the entire proposal, including the preamble.

Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Despite the best efforts of colonial powers such as the United States and Britain to oppose it, the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee still passed, by a majority vote, proposals advocating for the restoration of the independence and right to self-determination of the Moroccan and Tunisian peoples.

It is remembered that the United States and its allies successfully blocked the passage of such proposals at the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly last year. They had similarly attempted to block the passage of these proposals at this session of the General Assembly, but failed. This fact demonstrates that it has become more difficult for the United States to manipulate the United Nations General Assembly, and that the "rebellion" of representatives from many colonial and semi-colonial countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America against the United States has further developed. This is a reflection of the surging development of national liberation movements over the past year.

During the discussion of the Tunisian and Moroccan issues at the Seventh General Assembly, the United States instigated eleven Latin American countries to jointly put forward a proposal to counter the proposal of Asian and Arab countries. The United States also relied on the votes of Latin American countries to gather a majority and veto the proposal advocating for the restoration of the right to self-determination of the Tunisian and Moroccan peoples. The United States tried to repeat this trick during the discussion of these two issues at this session of the General Assembly, but it did not succeed. The United States' manipulation of the representatives of Latin American countries did not work. During the discussion of the Moroccan issue at this session of the General Assembly, the United States again attempted to have Latin American countries jointly put forward a proposal to counter the proposal of Asian and Arab countries. However, multiple behind-the-scenes meetings of Latin American countries failed to reach an agreement, and fierce disputes occurred between the representatives of Colombia and Uruguay in the behind-the-scenes meetings. As a result, only Bolivia put forward a proposal alone. This proposal was then amended by India and other countries. Colonial countries such as the United States and Britain vetoed the Asian and Arab countries' proposal by a narrow majority. However, despite the opposition of the United States and Britain, the Political Committee passed the Bolivian proposal, as amended by India and other countries. The amended proposal clearly advocated for the recognition of the right to self-determination of the Moroccan people. In the discussion of the Tunisian issue, the United States was even unable to produce a Latin American country proposal to counter the Asian and Arab countries' proposal. Moreover, the Asian and Arab countries' proposal was finally passed in the Political Committee. Some Latin American countries, such as Guatemala, Mexico, Argentina, and Peru, did not follow the United States in voting against this proposal; they either voted in favor or abstained.

The outcome of the vote on the proposals regarding the Moroccan and Tunisian issues is a blow to the imperialist countries headed by the United States. Moreover, the entire discussion of these two issues is a moral judgment on imperialist colonial policies. Many country representatives strongly criticized the bloody suppression of the national liberation movements in Morocco and Tunisia by French colonialists in the discussion, and condemned the attitude of colonial countries such as the United States and Britain in supporting France. Representatives of the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries defended the demands of the Moroccan and Tunisian peoples for national independence in the discussion.

By openly opposing the right to national self-determination, the United States and its allies have thoroughly exposed themselves to the world as the deadly enemies of national liberation movements in colonies and dependent countries. The Indian "Tribune" said: "Western propagandists tell us every day that Western countries are very eager to maintain and develop freedom... The vote on the Moroccan issue tells people another story... Hundreds of millions of men and women in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa see around them European imperialism and its various cruel and brutal acts of terror."

### 联大政委会分别通过关于摩洛哥和突尼斯问题的提案  主张恢复摩洛哥突尼斯人民的独立自决权

    联大政委会分别通过关于摩洛哥和突尼斯问题的提案
    主张恢复摩洛哥突尼斯人民的独立自决权
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：联合国大会政治委员会在二十六日上午就十三个阿拉伯与亚洲国家提出的关于突尼斯问题的提案进行表决。
    委员会通过了十三国提案的序言，并以三十二票赞成，十九票反对，五票弃权，通过一项建议草案，建议“采取一切必要步骤来保证突尼斯人民行使他们的充分自主与独立的权利”。
    但是，委员会否决了以下几项特别建议：就是废除在突尼斯所颁布的戒严令，恢复公民自由权，立刻与经过普选成立的突尼斯政府的代表进行谈判，以使突尼斯人民能够行使充分权利。这样就从十三国提案中删去了这些旨在公正解决突尼斯问题的最重要的建议。
    这个经过删削的十三国提案在作为整个提案进行表决的时候，二十九票赞成，二十二票反对，五票弃权。
    苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰与捷克斯洛伐克投票赞成提案的每一条。美国代表团投票反对包括序言在内的整个提案。
    【新华社二十八日讯】尽管美、英等殖民国家竭力反对，联合国大会政治委员会仍以多数票通过主张恢复摩洛哥及突尼斯人民独立自决权的提案。
    人们记得，美国及其盟国在去年联合国第七届大会上阻止通过这种提案，并获得成功。它们在这届大会上同样曾设法阻止通过这些提案，但是却失败了。这个事实表明，美国操纵联合国大会已经更加困难，亚洲、非洲及拉丁美洲许多殖民地及半殖民地国家代表对美国的“反叛”已进一步发展了。这是各国民族解放运动一年来汹涌开展的一种反映。
    在第七届大会讨论突尼斯及摩洛哥问题时，美国唆使十一个拉丁美洲国家联合提出提案，来对抗亚洲及阿拉伯国家提案。美国并且依靠拉丁美洲国家票数，凑够多数，否决了主张恢复突尼斯及摩洛哥人民自决权的提案。在这届大会讨论这两个问题时，美国重施故技，但没有成功。美国对拉丁美洲国家代表的操纵不灵了。在这届大会讨论摩洛哥问题时，美国又企图使拉丁美洲国家联合提出一项提案，来对抗亚洲及阿拉伯国家提案。但是，拉丁美洲国家幕后举行多次会议，都无法获致协议，哥伦比亚与乌拉圭代表在幕后会议上发生了激烈争执。结果，只由玻利维亚单独提出一项提案。这个提案又经印度等国修正。美、英等殖民国家以微弱多数否决了亚洲及阿拉伯国家提案。但是，不顾美、英等国的反对，政治委员会通过了经印度等国修正的玻利维亚提案，修正后的提案明确主张承认摩洛哥人民的自决权。在讨论突尼斯问题中，美国更没有能够搞出一个拉丁美洲国家提案，来对抗亚洲及阿拉伯国家提案。而且，亚洲及阿拉伯国家提案最后在政治委员会中通过了。危地马拉、墨西哥、阿根廷、秘鲁等一些拉丁美洲国家没有跟着美国一道投票反对这个提案，它们或者投票赞成，或者弃权。
    关于摩洛哥及突尼斯问题提案的表决结果，对于以美国为首的帝国主义国家是一个打击。而且，关于这两个问题的整个讨论，就是对帝国主义殖民政策道义上的审判。许多国家代表在讨论中强烈抨击法国殖民者血腥镇压摩洛哥及突尼斯的民族解放运动，并谴责美、英等殖民国家支持法国的态度。苏联及人民民主国家代表在讨论中维护摩洛哥及突尼斯人民争取民族独立的要求。
    美国及其盟国公开反对民族自决权，从而向全世界彻底暴露了它们是殖民地及附属国民族解放运动的死敌。印度“论坛报”说：“西方国家的宣传家们每天告诉我们说，西方国家非常希望维护和发展自由，……关于摩洛哥问题的提案的表决告诉人们的却是另外一回事。……亚洲、中东和非洲千百万男女在周围看到的是欧洲帝国主义以及它们的种种残忍凶暴的恐怖行为。”
