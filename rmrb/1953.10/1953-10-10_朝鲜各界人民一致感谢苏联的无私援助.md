    [Report from our newspaper] People from all walks of life in Korea warmly welcome the results of the talks between the Soviet and Korean governments and unanimously thank the Soviet Union for its selfless assistance. Xu Hui, Vice-Chairman of the Korean Federation of Trade Unions, speaking on behalf of all Korean workers, technicians, and staff, said: "The communiqué of the talks between the Soviet and Korean governments infinitely inspires the will and confidence of us Korean workers, technicians, and staff to struggle for the restoration and construction of the people's economy."
    Xu Hui said: "The selfless assistance of the great Soviet people has become one of the decisive factors for us to overcome difficulties and advance victoriously during the five years of democratic construction after liberation and during the three-year-plus Fatherland Liberation War. At present, our task is to rapidly restore and develop the people's economy that has been destroyed by the war, improve and improve the material welfare of our people, and further consolidate the material foundation necessary for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The Soviet people will assist us in rapidly restoring the basic industries damaged by the war, restoring and constructing many industrial enterprises and railway transportation, postal and telecommunications, agriculture, education, culture, health and other facilities and equipment urgently needed to improve people's living standards, providing technical assistance and other forms of assistance. There is no doubt that this assistance will further strengthen the friendship between the Korean and Soviet people, further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance in our country, and greatly promote the cause of peaceful reunification of our motherland and maintaining peace and security in Asia."
    Xu Hui said: "We, the Korean working class, must further strengthen our friendship with the Soviet people; work harder to complete the huge plan for post-war restoration and construction work as instructed by our beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party. The realization of this plan requires, in particular, the high degree of creativity and selfless struggle of our workers and technicians."
    Hyun Chil-jong, Vice-Chairman of the Korean Farmers' Union, said: "The assistance given to us by the Soviet Union includes the Hungnam Mineral Fertilizer Factory, which is necessary for the reconstruction and revitalization of agriculture, and the supply of agricultural machinery, farm tools, fertilizers, purebred sires, etc., which are of decisive significance for the restoration and development of agriculture. This is infinitely joyful news for us farmers. This news has strengthened our farmers' strength and courage to restore and develop agriculture a hundredfold." Hyun Chil-jong called on all Korean farmers to work hard to produce, accelerate the restoration and development of the rural economy, in order to repay the great internationalist assistance of the Soviet Union; at the same time, further strengthen friendship and solidarity with the Soviet people, strengthen the alliance with the working class, and strive for the victory of the construction cause and the early realization of the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
    Kim Young-soo, Vice-Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's Union, in addition to expressing heartfelt thanks to the Soviet government and the Soviet people on behalf of Korean women, emphasized: "We Korean women must further develop the heroism and labor enthusiasm shown during the Fatherland Liberation War in the struggle to restore and build the post-war people's economy, in order to win new victories." Kim Young-soo said: "Now many of our women have joined the new labor front, and in various positions, the work that women can do is done by women. We must learn from the glorious example of advanced Soviet women working hard to build communism, and unite as one to fight for the cause of restoring and building the post-war people's economy."

    朝鲜各界人民一致感谢苏联的无私援助
    【本报讯】朝鲜各界人民热烈欢迎苏、朝两国会谈的结果，并一致感谢苏联的无私援助。朝鲜职业总同盟副委员长徐辉代表全朝鲜的工人、技术人员和职员们发表谈话说：苏联和朝鲜政府的会谈公报，无限地鼓舞了我们朝鲜工人、技术人员和职员们为恢复和建设人民经济而奋斗的意志和信心。
    徐辉说：伟大苏联人民的无私援助，成了我们在解放后五年间的民主建设时期和在三年多的祖国解放战争当中所以能够克服困难、胜利前进的决定性的要素之一。目前，我们的任务是要迅速恢复和发展被战争破坏的人民经济，提高和改善我们人民的物质福利，更加巩固为和平统一祖国所必需的物质基础。苏联人民将援助我们迅速恢复因战争遭到破坏的基本产业，恢复和建设为提高人民生活水平所迫切需要的许多产业企业和铁路运输、邮电、农业、教育、文化、保健等各方面的设备及器材的供应、技术的帮助以及其他方式的援助。毫无疑问，这一援助，将进一步加强朝鲜人民和苏联人民之间的友谊，更加巩固我国的工农联盟，并大大地促进和平统一我们的祖国与维护亚洲的和平与安全的事业。
    徐辉说：我们朝鲜的工人阶级，一定要进一步加强和苏联人民的友谊；更加努力去完成我们敬爱的领袖金日成元帅在朝鲜劳动党中央委员会第六次全体会议上所指示的战后进行恢复与建设工作的巨大计划。这个计划的实现，特别需要我们工人和技术员工的高度的创造性和忘我斗争。
    朝鲜农民同盟副委员长玄七钟发表谈话说：苏联给予我们的援助包括重建复兴农业所必需的兴南矿质肥料工厂，并供给对恢复与发展农业有决定意义的农业机器、农具、肥料、纯种公畜等。这对于我们农民来说，是无限喜庆的消息。这一消息百倍地加强了我们农民恢复和发展农业的力量和勇气。玄七钟号召朝鲜全体农民努力生产，加速恢复和发展农村经济，以答谢苏联的国际主义的伟大援助；同时进一步地加强和苏联人民的友谊团结，加强与工人阶级的联盟，争取建设事业的胜利及祖国和平统一的早日实现。
    朝鲜民主妇女同盟副委员长金英秀除了代表朝鲜妇女向苏联政府和苏联人民表示衷心的感谢之外，并强调说：我们朝鲜妇女，要在恢复和建设战后人民经济的斗争中，进一步发挥在祖国解放战争时期所曾表现的英雄气概和劳动热情，以争取新的胜利。金英秀说：现在我们许多妇女参加了新的劳动战线，在各个岗位上，把妇女所能够做的工作，都由妇女来做。我们要学习先进的苏联妇女为建设共产主义而努力的光荣榜样，并且团结得如同一个人一样地为恢复和建设战后人民经济的事业而斗争。
