Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th -- No prisoners of war were brought to the East Camp explanation tent today, the 20th, to listen to explanations. Brigadier General Gaol, Chief of Staff of the Indian Custodial Forces, told the Korean-Chinese side that it was impossible to bring out any captured Korean People's Army personnel today. Therefore, the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work was halted for another day.

Since the explanation work began on the 15th, this is the third full day that explanation work could not be carried out out of five explanation work days. On the other two working days, a total of only seven hours of explanation work was conducted.

The situation in these five days is that the explanation work plan proposed by the Korean-Chinese side on a daily basis has been sabotaged, while the anti-explanation work plan formulated by the Chiang and Rhee agents directed by the US side has been implemented. Because the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has not taken effective measures against the sabotage activities of US and Rhee agents coercing and preventing prisoners of war from leaving the camp to listen to explanations, not a single captured Korean People's Army personnel has enjoyed the right to listen to explanations stipulated by the "Terms of Reference"; and the approximately one thousand captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel who came to listen to explanations are still under the strict control and threat of US and Chiang agents, and cannot freely express their desire for repatriation.

In accordance with the provisions of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work" of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the Korean-Chinese side submitted to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission at 10:00 a.m. on the 15th a work plan for explaining to one thousand captured Korean People's Army personnel on the 16th. However, because the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission failed to take effective measures, the sabotage tactics of the US and Rhee agents were realized, causing the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work to be suspended on the 16th.

In accordance with the provisions of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work" of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the Korean-Chinese side has the right to conduct explanation work according to its own plan. Therefore, the Korean-Chinese side again notified the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the evening of the 16th, requesting that the plan originally scheduled for the 16th be implemented on the 17th. However, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission still failed to effectively complete its work tasks on the 17th. In order to take into account the difficulties of the Indian Custodial Forces, the Korean-Chinese side agreed to the request of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission at 2:00 p.m. on the 17th, and changed to explaining to approximately five hundred captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel.

In order to prevent the explanation work from being delayed due to the obstruction and sabotage of US agents, the Korean-Chinese side notified the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 18th that it was prepared to continue to implement the plan to explain to captured Korean People's Army personnel on the 19th, and stated that it could only explain to captured Korean People's Army personnel in any one of the two camps originally planned, in order to reduce the difficulties in implementation claimed by the Indian Custodial Forces. However, not a single captured Korean People's Army personnel was brought out of the camp to listen to explanations on the 19th.

The Korean-Chinese side submitted the explanation work plan for the 20th as required on the 19th. In the plan, the Korean-Chinese side added two more camps in addition to the two camps originally scheduled for explanation, and stated that the Indian Custodial Forces could bring out captured Korean People's Army personnel from any one of these four camps to listen to explanations. However, this plan also failed to be implemented.

Because the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has failed to complete its tasks for several consecutive days, the arrogance of US agents is becoming more rampant. The Kuomintang bandit gang's Wenshan telegraph on the 19th has predicted that the explanation work will be "delayed indefinitely." The United Press of the United States also sent a telegram from Wenshan on the 20th, saying that the explanation work will "tend to collapse." It is obvious that if the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission cannot take effective measures in time to break the control of US agents, its own solemn mission will not be completed.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th -- Song Minglu and Cui Wende, captured Korean People's Army personnel who escaped from the 48th camp, where they had been unable to listen to explanations due to agent control for several days, said after returning to repatriation that the captured personnel on our side in the 48th camp are eager to have the control of US agents broken, allowing them to leave the camp to listen to explanations.

Song Minglu said: "At 9:00 a.m. on the 16th, when an Indian officer ordered the prisoners of war in the 48th camp to go out to listen to explanations, Jiang Jinglie, the leader of the Rhee bandit agents and the 'Anti-Communist Youth League' mixed in the camp, ordered the 'security guards' holding knives to surround us, preventing us from going out to listen to explanations. These agents also pretended to be prisoners of war and shouted to the Indian officer: 'We don't want to listen to explanations!' At that time, we all looked at the Indian officer, hoping that he would allow us to leave the camp to listen to explanations."

Cui Wende continued: "Later, the Indian troops raised a sign that said that they were limited to five minutes to go out to listen to explanations. We were all very happy, thinking that this time we could get rid of the control of the agents. Because these agents were all afraid of suppression by the Indian troops. Sure enough, the agents were all in chaos. Some said that we had to be allowed to accept explanations, while others insisted that we should not go out. Later, the leader of the 'security team' said: 'First, let them (the prisoners of war) be escorted into the tent to take a look!' The Rhee bandit agents immediately chased us into the trenches inside the tent to hide. At this time, we were all anxiously waiting for the Indian troops to come. However, we waited for a long time and they never came. Later, we learned that the Indian troops had withdrawn." Cui Wende said: "At that time, one agent said fluke: 'If the Indian troops had come in together, we really would have had no way. Fortunately, they didn't come in.'" Cui Wende and Song Minglu both said that as a result, the agents became even more emboldened. They stood at the door with wooden sticks and knives, preventing the prisoners of war from leaving the tent a step. They openly threatened the prisoners of war: "The Indian troops don't dare to touch us at all. The United Nations army planes and tanks are backing us up!"

Cui Wende and Song Minglu also said that on the same night that the agents prevented the prisoners of war from listening to explanations, Wen Zhonghao, the head of the agents mixed in the camp, issued a "directive" to the agents in the 48th camp to sabotage the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work. The "directive" stated: 1. Expand the "security team" organization, and assign captains and adjutants to each squad in order to further control the prisoners of war. 2. Concentrate all "unreliable elements" (referring to prisoners of war who firmly demand repatriation) into one squad, and imprison or kill them if necessary. 3. Hasten to manufacture weapons, make knives from gasoline barrel fragments, and make gasoline bombs by filling gasoline in bottles. Song Minglu said: The agents in the 48th camp are stepping up preparations in accordance with this "directive" in order to further sabotage the explanation work.

### 由于美方特务肆意进行破坏活动  我方的解释工作又被迫停顿一天  朝鲜人民军归来人员揭露美方特务暴力控制战俘的罪行

    由于美方特务肆意进行破坏活动
    我方的解释工作又被迫停顿一天
    朝鲜人民军归来人员揭露美方特务暴力控制战俘的罪行
    【新华社开城二十日电】二十日仍然没有一个战俘被带到东场里解释帐篷中来听取解释。印度看管部队参谋长高尔准将告诉朝中方面说：今天不可能带出任何朝鲜人民军被俘人员。因此，朝中方面的解释工作又停顿了一天。
    自从十五日解释工作开始以来，在五个解释工作日中，这是不能进行解释工作的第三个整天。在另外的两个工作日中，总共只进行了七个小时的解释工作。
    这五天中的情况是：朝中方面逐日提出的解释工作计划遭到了破坏，而美方指挥的蒋、李特务所制定的反解释工作的计划却得到了实施。由于中立国遣返委员会没有对美、李特务胁迫阻止战俘出营场听取解释的破坏活动采取有效措施，朝鲜人民军被俘人员还没有一个人享受到“职权范围”规定的听取解释的权利；而前来听解释的约一千名中国人民志愿军被俘人员，则因为仍然处在美、蒋特务的严密控制与威胁下，也不能自由表达遣返的意愿。
    朝中方面按照中立国遣返委员会“解释和访问工作细则”的规定，曾在十五日上午十时向中立国遣返委员会提出了十六日对一千名朝鲜人民军被俘人员解释的工作计划。但是，由于中立国遣返委员会未能采取有效措施，美、李特务的破坏策略得以实现，致使朝中方面在十六日的解释工作陷于停顿。
    按照中立国遣返委员会“解释和访问工作细则”的规定，朝中方面有权按照自己的计划进行解释工作。因而朝中方面又在十六日晚再次通知中立国遣返委员会，要求在十七日执行原应在十六日执行的计划。但十七日中立国遣返委员会仍未能有效地完成它的工作任务。朝中方面为了照顾印度看管部队的困难，于十七日下午二时同意中立国遣返委员会的请求，改向约五百名中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行解释。
    为了使解释工作不致因美方特务的阻挠、破坏而拖延，朝中方面于十八日通知中立国遣返委员会，准备在十九日继续执行向朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行解释的计划，并表示可以只向原定两个营场中的任何一个营场中的朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行解释，以减少印度看管部队所称的执行时的困难。但是十九日仍无一名朝鲜人民军被俘人员被带出营场听取解释。
    二十日的解释工作计划，朝中方面早按规定在十九日提出。朝中方面在计划中除了原定要进行解释的两个营场外，又增加了两个营场，并表示印度看管部队可以把这四个营场中的任何一个营场中的朝鲜人民军被俘人员带出听取解释。但是这一计划同样未能付诸实施。
    由于中立国遣返委员会接连几天未能完成它的任务，美方特务分子的气焰正在更趋嚣张。国民党匪帮的通讯社汶山十九日电已预言说：解释工作将“无限期拖延”。美国合众社二十日也在汶山发出一条电讯，也说解释工作将“趋于垮台”。很明显中立国遣返委员会如果不能及时采取有效措施打破美方特务的控制，则它自己的庄严任务将无法完成。
    【新华社开城二十日电】十九日从几天以来由于特务控制未能听取解释的第四十八号营场逃出来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员宋明鲁、崔文德，在遣返归来后说：第四十八号营场里的我方被俘人员，急切地盼望能够使美方特务的控制被打破，让他们出营场去听取解释。
    宋明鲁说：“十六日九点钟，当一个印度军官命令第四十八号营场的战俘出去听取解释时，混在营场里的李匪特务、‘反共青年团’组长姜京烈就命令拿着刀子的‘警备队员’把我们包围起来，不许我们出去听取解释。这些特务分子还冒充战俘对印度军官喊道：‘我们不愿意听解释！’当时，我们都看着印度军官，希望他使我们能够出营场去听取解释。”
    崔文德接着说：“后来，印度部队举起了一个纸牌子，上面写着限五分钟出去听取解释。我们心里都非常高兴，以为这下子可以解除特务的控制了。因为这些特务分子都是害怕印度部队镇压的。果然，特务分子都混乱起来了。有的说，只好让我们去接受解释了，也有的还坚持不让我们出去。后来，‘警备队’的组长说：‘先把他们（战俘）押进帐篷里去看一看再说！’李匪特务就立刻把我们撵到帐篷内的壕沟里去躲起来。这时，我们都焦急地等待着印度部队会来。可是，等了很久总是不来，后来才知道印度部队已经撤走了。”崔文德说：“当时有一个特务分子就侥幸地说：‘假使印度部队一齐进来，我们真的没有办法了。幸亏他们没有进来。’”崔文德和宋明鲁都说，这样的结果，特务们就更胆大妄为起来了。他们拿着木棍和刀子站在门口，不许战俘出帐篷一步。他们公开威胁战俘说：“印度部队根本不敢动我们一动。联合国军的飞机、坦克给我们撑着腰哩！”
    崔文德、宋明鲁还说，就在特务阻止战俘听取解释的当天晚上，混在营场里的特务头子文重浩又发给第四十八号营场的特务分子一份破坏朝中方面解释工作“指示”。“指示”上说：一、要把“警备队”组织扩大，队长和副官都要分到各个小队去，以便进一步控制战俘。二、把所有“不可靠分子”（指坚决要求遣返的战俘）集中起来编成一个小队，必要时把他们囚禁起来或者杀掉。三、赶快制造武器，把汽油筒碎片做成刀子，把汽油装在瓶子里做成燃烧弹。宋明鲁说：第四十八号营场里的特务分子正在根据这个“指示”加紧进行准备，以便进一步破坏解释工作。
