Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 30th. German Democratic Republic Foreign Minister Lothar Bolz stated that the foundation of the GDR's foreign policy is: to guarantee peace in Europe and actively strive for the reunification of Germany through understanding between the people of East and West Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis. Bolz made the above statement on October 28th when answering questions from the German News Agency regarding the foreign policy statement of Bonn government "Chancellor" Adenauer. In a speech to the West German "Bonn" parliament on the 20th, Adenauer openly declared that the principles of his foreign policy were: not to recognize the Oder-Neisse peace border between Germany and Poland, and to incorporate all of Germany into the militarily aggressive so-called "European Defense Community."

Bolz pointed out that the main purpose of Adenauer's foreign policy speech was to accelerate the incorporation of West Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. Adenauer is trying to force the immediate implementation of the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty, the main purpose of which is to revive aggressive German militarism, establish a West German "Defense Force" to serve American war plans, and thus turn West Germany into a major forward base and a dangerous source of aggressive war for launching new wars in Europe. Bolz said that Adenauer and his Washington masters are eager to implement the "European Defense Community" treaty, precisely demonstrating the weakness of the warmongers and their fear of the growing world people's peace movement.

He particularly pointed out that Adenauer's aggressive goals are not only directed at the German Democratic Republic and Germany's eastern neighbors, but also at Germany's western neighbors, and the French people are being threatened just like the Polish people.

Bolz then pointed out that in order to guarantee peace in Europe and to achieve German reunification on a democratic and peaceful basis, it is necessary to establish a democratic all-German provisional government through all-German understanding in order to prepare for and implement free all-German elections and establish a unified, independent, and peace-loving Germany. In the near future, a fair peace treaty with Germany should be prepared and concluded with the participation of all-German representatives. All good Germans must strive to achieve all-German understanding as soon as possible and prevent the implementation of the Bonn and Paris treaties.

He finally talked about Germany's debts and war reparations, saying: The government of the German Democratic Republic believes that, regardless of how other issues are decided, measures must be taken in the near future to alleviate Germany's post-war economic and financial burden. To this end, the German Democratic Republic, on behalf of the German people, suggests to the United States, Britain, and France that they announce the immediate cessation of all national demands for reparations and post-war debts from Germany in any way, and reduce the occupation fees in West Germany to no more than five percent of national income. In this regard, Western governments should follow the example of the Soviet Union. The government of the German Democratic Republic also requests that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France consider returning the factories they have in West Germany to the German people.

    德意志民主共和国外交部长博尔茨发表声明
    主张在和平民主基础上建立全德临时政府
    谴责阿登纳参加美国侵略集团的外交政策
    【新华社柏林三十日电】德意志民主共和国外交部长洛·博尔茨说：德意志民主共和国外交政策的基础是：保证欧洲和平，积极争取在民主与和平的基础上，通过德国东西两部人民谅解的方式谋取德国的统一。博尔茨是在十月二十八日就波恩政府“总理”阿登纳的外交政策声明回答德意志通讯社记者的询问时发表了上述声明。阿登纳二十日在向西德“波恩”议会发表演说时，公开宣布他的外交政策的原则是：不承认德、波之间的奥得—尼斯河和平边界，而且要把整个德国并入军事侵略性的所谓“欧洲防务集团”。
    博尔茨指出：阿登纳外交政策演说的主要目的，就是加速把西德并入北大西洋侵略集团。阿登纳力图强使所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约立即付诸实施，这个条约的主要目的就是复活侵略性的德国军国主义，建立一支为美国战争计划服务的西德“国防军”，从而把西德变为在欧洲发动新战争的主要前进基地及危险的侵略战争的策源地。博尔茨说：阿登纳和他的华盛顿主子急于要实行“欧洲防务集团”条约，正说明了战争贩子的软弱和害怕日益壮大的世界人民和平运动。
    他特别指出：阿登纳的侵略目标不仅是针对着德意志民主共和国和德国的东邻，而且也针对着德国的西邻，法国人民正和波兰人民一样受到威胁。
    博尔茨接着指出，为了保证欧洲和平和在民主与和平的基础上求得德国的统一，必须通过全德谅解建立民主的全德临时政府，以便准备与实行全德自由选举，并建立起一个统一、独立与爱好和平的德国。在最近时期内，应该在全德代表参加下准备并缔结一个公正的对德和约。一切善良的德国人必须努力争取尽快达成全德谅解，阻止实行波恩和巴黎条约。
    他最后谈到德国所负的债务和战争赔偿问题，他说：德意志民主共和国政府认为，不论其他问题如何决定，必须在最近期间采取措施减轻德国战后经济与财政负担，为此，德意志民主共和国代表全德人民向美、英、法三国建议宣布立即停止一切国家用任何方式向德国要求的赔偿及战后债务，并减少西德的占领费到不超过国家收入的百分之五，在这方面，西方国家政府应该仿效苏联的榜样。德意志民主共和国政府同时要求美、英、法三国政府考虑把他们在西德的工厂归还给德国人民。
