    New Atmosphere in Rural Areas After Universal Suffrage
    No More "Grasping at Everything" in Work
    Gao Licheng, the Party Branch Secretary of Shangqiao Township, Yongan District, Taixing County, Jiangsu Province, held six positions before the universal suffrage, including Director of Civil Affairs and Director of Mediation. He once held six meetings in different villages in one day and simultaneously deployed fourteen central tasks at a meeting of township and village cadres. He was worried about letting others handle anything in the township, regardless of its importance, so he "grasped at everything." As a result, many important things were not done well. During the universal suffrage, the masses raised many opinions to him, which he accepted, and he examined the shortcomings in his work. Now, in addition to serving as the Party Branch Secretary and Township Chairman, he only holds one other position. In nearly two months, he only held two mass meetings in his own electoral district. When deploying work, he no longer "grasped at everything" and was able to focus on production as the overriding central task. He could also bury himself in his work. For example, the central task of the township after the universal suffrage was to reorganize the mutual aid teams. He first went to his own electoral district and focused on the Zhang Bingwen mutual aid team to understand the situation within the team. He found that there were many problems: the work accounts from the spring had not been settled, and the team members had opinions; in the past, they did not proceed from production needs but sought "enthusiasm" and emphasized "large-scale mutual aid," resulting in wasted labor; the team leader had selfish behaviors, causing dissatisfaction among the team members, who wanted to withdraw from the mutual aid team. He talked to the team members and the team leader separately, first unifying everyone's thinking, and then convened a team member meeting through the team leader to carry out democratic discussion, allowing the team leader to make a self-criticism. Those who were owed wages also promised to pay them back, which satisfied everyone. After the meeting, everyone returned to their respective electoral districts to promote this experience. Because the problem was resolved well, the autumn harvest plan was quickly formulated. Those who originally planned to withdraw from the team no longer wanted to do so. The members of the township government learned the method of reorganizing the mutual aid teams and, in nearly twenty days, reorganized thirty-six mutual aid teams and developed four temporary mutual aid teams based on the masses' working habits. Township and village cadres also personally participated in production and no longer ran around outside all day "busy" with work, as in the past. As a result, the autumn harvest work was completed in eight days throughout the township. In preparing for autumn planting, the entire township was short more than two thousand catties of wheat seeds, which were quickly resolved through methods such as "relatives helping relatives, neighbors helping neighbors," and free lending.

    "Our Deputy Village Head Has Really Changed!"
    Sanhe Village in the Sixth District of Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province, is one of the model villages for the universal suffrage pilot program in Songjiang Province. In the process of universal suffrage, the masses carefully identified the cadres and selected those they were satisfied with as representatives, giving all the cadres a profound education. As a result, the working methods and work styles of most cadres have undergone significant changes after the universal suffrage. Su Liqing used to be the village head, active and diligent in his work, able to complete tasks, but his working methods had shortcomings, and he was subjective and did not trust the abilities of others, loving to take over and do everything himself. This caused dissatisfaction among many cadres, who said, "If the village head is capable, let him do it all!" In the universal suffrage, the masses praised his work achievements but also pointed out his shortcomings in his work. At the congress of representatives, he was re-elected as the deputy village head. Su Liqing did not become negative because of this. He actively tried to change his working methods. He first paid attention to giving full play to the collective strength of the cadres and listening to the opinions of the masses. During a village-wide mutual aid team leader meeting to mobilize the formulation of a grass-cutting plan, he collected the opinions of the masses and promoted the work through the production committee, thereby enhancing the cadres' sense of responsibility and work enthusiasm. In three days, the entire village cut more than 50,000 bundles of grass. Su Liqing also adopted the method of education and persuasion towards the masses. When mobilizing everyone to enter the mountains to cut wood, some mutual aid team members were unwilling to go. He patiently persuaded them, helped the team leader study methods of exchanging labor within the team, eliminated the concerns of the masses, and made everyone participate happily in the logging work. Now, the masses generally reflect, "Our Deputy Village Head has really changed!"

    Everyone Discusses Matters Together
    In July, when crops needed rain, the weather showed signs of drought. The newly elected people's representatives of Shuangfengsi Village, Chengde County, Hebei Province, convened a meeting to study drought resistance measures. The meeting decided to use the water from the Wulie River near the village to irrigate the land. However, the Wulie River passed through Xiaodonggou Village, a neighboring village. To divert the river water to Shuangfengsi to irrigate the land, a ditch had to be dug. According to past experience, this would encounter two difficulties: some people in Xiaodonggou Village were unwilling to let the water flow downstream; the masses in this village were afraid that digging the ditch would delay work and worried that it would not work.

    However, after the universal suffrage, the situation in Shuangfengsi Village had changed. The universal suffrage movement educated the people and also educated the cadres. The masses trusted the leadership of the cadres and consciously and willingly responded to the call of the representatives; the relationship between people internally also improved.

    The newly elected village head, Yang Yuwen, and the deputy village head, Lin Guiying, visited the farmer Yan Ling. When Yan Ling saw the new village head personally coming to his home, he felt happy from the bottom of his heart; when he heard about digging a ditch to divert water to irrigate the land, he agreed wholeheartedly. After the masses were mobilized, Village Head Yang Yuwen went to Xiaodonggou Village, a neighboring village, and discussed the joint use of the Wulie River water source with Village Head Li Pu. The two village heads solved the problem with a discussion. Li Pu said, "We will release water for you tomorrow and guarantee that you will be able to irrigate your land." The farmers near the river were very happy when they heard the news. They dug the ditch in two days, and the water from the Wulie River flowed along the rice paddy ditch in Xiaodonggou Village all the way to the dry land in Shuangfengsi Village. Everyone clapped their hands and laughed when they saw the water.

    Cadres Are No Longer "Difficult to Be"
    The cadres in Nanlang Township, Fanglin District, Guangzhou City suburbs, were mostly elected by the masses during the land reform review last year. Most of the cadres are very active in their work and have done a lot of things for the people of the township. However, due to the serious phenomenon of "excessiveness" and the tight schedule and lack of experience, many cadres had coercive orders in their work, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. Some cadres became negative and depressed because they did not receive the support of the masses. At the beginning of the universal suffrage, many cadres thought that "cadres are difficult to be" and had the idea of ​​"changing shifts" and not doing it. The masses also had the idea of ​​not electing them again.

    In response to this situation, the universal suffrage work team carried out democratic education for cadres and the masses to improve the abnormal relationship between cadres and the masses; on the other hand, it affirmed the achievements of the township cadres through production summaries. At the same time, it encouraged cadres to review their shortcomings in their past work to the masses, and encouraged the masses to boldly raise opinions to the cadres. Subsequently, Township Head Chen Youtao took the lead in reviewing his shortcomings at the township cadre joint meeting; Deputy Township Head Huang Jinbo also reviewed his mistake of only caring about his own production and not caring about work.

    The delegates and team leaders who attended the meeting conveyed the cadres' reviews to the masses. The masses expressed satisfaction after hearing this and raised many constructive opinions. They did not obliterate the cadres' work achievements. Farmer Chen Jie said, "Our township head has done a good job in leading production." Township Head Chen Youtao was very moved when he heard the masses' opinions to him and said, "Everyone is so concerned about work and has given me many good opinions. It will be easier to work in the future, and cadres are not difficult to be."

    普选后的农村新气象
    做工作不再是“眉毛胡髭一把抓”了
    江苏省泰兴县永安区上桥乡党支部书记高礼成，普选前，身兼民政主任、调解主任等六职，他曾在一天内到各村召开过六个大会，另在一次乡村干部会议上同时布置过十四件中心工作。他对乡里的事，不问大小，都不放心给别人去做，由自己来“眉毛胡髭一把抓”。因此，有很多重要的事情做不好。普选中，群众给他提了很多意见，他都接受了，并检查了自己工作中的缺点。现在，他除担任党支部书记和乡主席以外，只兼了一职。将近两个月内，他只在自己掌握的选区开了两次群众会，布置工作时不再“眉毛胡髭一把抓”了，而且都能以生产为压倒一切的中心任务。他也能埋下头去做工作。如该乡普选后的中心任务是整理互助组。他就先到自己掌握的选区里，抓住张炳文互助组，摸清组内的情况。他发现组内存在不少问题：春季的工账还没有结清，组员们有意见；过去在生产中不从生产需要出发，贪“热火”，讲究“大互助”，因而造成浪费人力的现象；组长有自私自利的行为，引起组员的不满，要退出互助组。他就分别找组员、组长谈话，先搞通大家的思想，再通过组长召开了组员会议，开展民主讨论，让组长进行了检讨，欠工资的人也保证还清，大家都很满意。会后大家回到自己负责的选区里去推广这个经验。因为问题解决得很好，秋收计划也很快就订了出来。原来打算退组的人，也不再要退组了。乡政府委员们学会了整理互助组的办法，回到自己负责的选区，在将近二十天的时间内，就整理好了三十六个互助组，并根据群众伴工习惯，发展了四个临时互助组。乡、村干部也都亲自参加生产，不再像过去那样一天到晚在外面跑，“忙”工作。因而全乡秋收工作八天内就完成了。在准备秋种中，全乡困难户共缺两千多斤麦种，也用“亲帮亲，邻帮邻”和自由借贷等办法很快解决了。    （张安民）
    “咱们的副村长可真转变啦！”
    松江省尚志县六区三合村，是松江省普选试办典型村之一。在普选过程中，群众认真地对干部进行了一次鉴别，并挑选了他们所满意的人作为代表，使全体干部都受到了一次深刻的教育，因而大部分干部的工作方法和工作作风在普选后都有了显著的转变。苏立清过去是村长，工作积极肯干，能完成任务，但工作方法有缺点，并有主观主义，不大相信别人的能力，爱包办代替。这样就引起了许多干部的不满，说：“村长能干就让他一人干得啦！”普选中，群众表扬了他的工作成绩，同时指出了他工作中的缺点，代表大会上并把他改选为副村长。苏立清并未因此而消极起来，他积极设法改变自己的工作方法。他首先注意到充分发挥干部的集体力量，听取群众的意见。在一次全村互助组长会议上发动订割草计划时，他收集群众的意见，并通过生产委员来推动工作，因而提高了干部的责任感和工作积极性。三天内全村割了五万多捆草。苏立清对群众也采取了教育说服的方法，在动员大家入山伐木时，有的互助组组员不愿去，他就耐心地去说服他们，帮助组长研究组内换工的办法，消除了群众的顾虑，使大家都愉快地参加了采伐工作。现在，群众普遍反映：“咱们的副村长可真转变啦！”
    大伙事大伙商量
    七月间，当庄稼正需要雨水的时候，天气呈现了一片旱象。热河省承德县双峰寺村新选出的人民代表们召开了会议，研究抗旱办法。会上决定利用村子附近的武烈河里的水来浇地。可是，武烈河的上游经过邻村小东沟村，要把河水引到双峰寺来浇地，必须挖一道沟。根据过去的经验，这会碰到两个困难：小东沟的一部分群众不愿意把水往下放；本村的群众怕挖沟误了工，又担心不顶事。
    但是，普选以后，双峰寺村的情况已经改变了。普选运动教育了人民，也教育了干部。群众信赖干部的领导，自觉自愿地响应代表们的号召；人民内部之间的关系也改善了。
    新当选的村长杨玉文、副村长林桂英，访问了农民阎龄。阎龄一看到新村长亲自来到自己的家，从心眼里感到高兴；他一听到挖沟引水浇地的事，就满口答应了。群众动起来之后，村长杨玉文又到邻村小东沟，和村长李普商谈了共同利用武烈河的水源问题。两个村长一商量就把问题解决了。李普说：“明天我们就给你们放水，管保让你们浇上地。”靠河套附近的农户听到这个消息都很高兴，两天挖好了沟，武烈河的水顺着小东沟村的稻田沟一直流到双峰寺村的旱地里，大家看见水高兴得拍着手笑。
    干部不“难当”了
    广州市郊芳林区南?乡的干部，多是在去年土地改革复查时为群众选出来的。大部分干部工作都很积极，替全乡人民办了不少事情。但是，由于“五多”现象严重，加上任务紧、经验不足，许多干部在工作中发生了强迫命令的现象，引起了群众的不满。有些干部因得不到群众的支持，就消极苦闷起来。普选开始时，有不少干部认为“干部难当”，存有“换班”不干的思想，群众也有不再选他们的想法。
    普选工作队针对这种情况，对干部、群众进行了民主教育，以改善干部和群众之间的不正常关系；另一方面通过生产总结肯定了乡干部的成绩。同时，启发干部向群众检讨过去工作中的缺点，鼓励群众大胆地向干部提出意见。随后，乡长陈有桃即在乡干部联席会上带头检讨了自己的缺点；副乡长黄锦波也检讨了只顾自己生产、不顾工作的错误。
    到会的代表、组长们把干部们检讨的情况，向群众进行了传达。群众听了都表示满意，并提出了很多建设性的意见。他们对干部的工作成绩，并不加以抹煞。农民陈洁说：“我们乡长在领导生产上是做得不错的。”乡长陈有桃听了群众对他提的意见，心里很感动，说：“大家这样关心工作，对我提了许多好的意见，今后工作就好办了，干部并不是难当的。”
