The People's Bank of Xikang has issued a large number of agricultural loans to help people of all ethnic minorities develop production. By mid-September, 5 billion yuan had been issued, nearly three times the total agricultural loans issued last year. The loans are being issued by work teams jointly formed by local banks, trade, and production departments. They go deep into the villages and fortresses of ethnic minority areas to understand the needs of farmers, publicize the policies of developing production, and then issue loans on the spot, giving consideration to interest rates and terms, so that the loans can meet the actual needs of farmers. For example, in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, due to the government's large-scale distribution of free agricultural implements this year, the number of land reclamation households has been increasing, and the cultivated area has been expanded. Many Tibetan farmers need to purchase more means of production, so the People's Bank has issued a large number of loans for livestock and seeds there. The People's Bank in various places has issued tens of thousands of catties of food grain loans to people of all ethnic groups in the province, including Tibetans, Yi, and Lisu.

In coordination with bank loans, the trade departments in various places have promptly carried out the work of allocating materials, enabling ethnic minorities who have obtained loans to purchase the means of production and means of livelihood they need. During the spring ploughing this year, Tibetan people in Danba County, Tibetan Autonomous Region, with the help of the local people's government, purchased more than 120 head of cattle.

    西康人民银行发放大批农贷
    西康各地人民银行发放大批农业贷款，帮助各少数民族人民发展生产，到九月中旬已发放五十亿元，将近去年全年农业贷款的三倍。贷款是由各地银行，贸易，生产等部门联合组成的工作队来进行的。他们深入少数民族地区的村、堡，了解农民要求，宣传发展生产的政策，然后就地发放，并在利息、期限等方面给予照顾，因此贷款都能符合农民的实际需要。如藏族自治区由于今年人民政府大量发放无偿农具，开荒户已日益增多，耕地面积扩大了，许多藏族农民需要添置生产资料，人民银行便在那里发放了大批耕畜、种籽的贷款。各地人民银行发放给全省藏、彝、傈僳等各族人民的口粮贷款，共合数十万斤粮食。
    各地贸易部门配合银行贷款，及时地进行了调拨物资的工作。使获得贷款的少数民族人民能买到他们需要的生产资料和生活资料。今年春耕时，藏族自治区丹巴县藏民在当地人民政府帮助下，就购进了耕牛一百二十多头。    （新华社）
