Brief Commentary on Cultural Life

Developing Local Opera in a Focused Manner Does Not Equate to Supporting One While Neglecting Others

According to incomplete statistics, there are nearly a hundred types of opera in the country. This illustrates the infinite richness of our national opera heritage. Every type of opera should be cherished and supported. The opera reform policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" should be earnestly implemented by the relevant art departments in various regions.

The Shanxi Provincial People's Government Cultural Affairs Bureau has shortcomings in implementing this policy. Opera audiences in Shanxi Province and artists of opera types other than Jin Opera have continuously reported to the cultural authorities and this newspaper that the leadership of the Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau favors Jin Opera (Central Route Bangzi), and adopts an attitude of neglect towards other opera types popular in the province that are equally loved by the people. Even Puzhou Bangzi, which came to Beijing to participate in the National Opera Performance last year, cannot receive cultivation and encouragement. The Pu Opera troupe rarely has performance opportunities within Shanxi, so it can only travel to other provinces to perform frequently. Other opera types in Shanxi, such as North Route Bangzi and Shangdang Gongdiao, are in the same situation. This is not "Let a hundred flowers bloom," but becomes "One flower blooms alone."

The Shanxi Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau's leadership's method of solely developing Jin Opera does not conform to the opera reform policy. The development of local opera types should be carried out in a focused and step-by-step manner, but various opera forms should also be encouraged to compete in friendship, rather than supporting one and neglecting others. The people's love for art is by no means narrow; good repertoire and excellent national art heritage are by no means only present in one type of opera. The Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Opera Reform Work" stated: "Chinese opera types are extremely rich and should be universally adopted, reformed and developed, and various opera forms should be encouraged to compete freely to promote the 'Let a hundred flowers bloom' policy of opera art." This should be resolutely implemented by us; listening humbly to the opinions of artists from various local opera types and striving for their close cooperation is the correct attitude of cultural work cadres of Party committees and governments at all levels towards opera reform work.

    文化生活简评
    重点地发展地方剧种不等于扶植一种而忽视其他
    据不完全的统计，全国的剧种有将近百种之多。这说明了我们的民族戏曲遗产的无限丰富。不论是哪一种剧种，都应该受到爱护和扶植。“百花齐放，推陈出新”的戏曲改革方针，应该由各地区的有关艺术工作部门切实执行。
    山西省人民政府文化事业管理局在执行这一方针上是有缺点的。山西省的戏曲观众和晋剧以外其它剧种的艺人们向文化主管部门和本报不断反映：该省文化事业管理局的领导方面偏爱晋剧（中路梆子），对省内流行的为人民同样喜爱的其他剧种采取了漠视态度。即使是去年也来北京参加全国戏曲会演的蒲州梆子，也得不到培养和鼓励。蒲剧团在山西境内很难有演出机会，以致只能经常到外省去旅行演出。山西的其他剧种如北路梆子、上党宫调也有同样情形。这样，就不是“百花齐放”，而成为“一花独放”了。
    山西省文化事业管理局领导方面这种单独发展晋剧的办法是不符合戏曲改革方针的。发展地方剧种应该有重点有步骤地进行，但也应鼓励各种戏曲形式友谊竞赛，而不是扶植一种，忽视其他。人民对艺术的爱好决不是狭隘的，好的剧目、优美的民族艺术遗产，决不单存在于某一种剧种当中。政务院在
    “关于戏曲改革工作的指示”中所提出的：“中国戏曲种类极为丰富，应该普遍地加以采用、改造与发展，鼓励各种戏曲形式的自由竞赛，促成戏曲艺术的‘百花齐放’方针。”应该为我们坚决执行；虚心倾听各地方剧种的艺人的意见，争取他们的亲密合作，是各地党和政府的文化工作干部对待戏曲改革工作的正确态度。
