In order to correctly compile the 1954 Basic Construction Project Plan, the Jilin Railway Bureau recently formed an inspection team to focus on on-site inspections of the outline of the 1954 Basic Construction Project Plan compiled in June of this year. The inspected projects accounted for 68% of all planned projects. During the inspection, it was found that unnecessary projects accounted for more than 34% of the number of inspections.

The most prominent problem discovered during the inspection was that the plan in June of this year lacked investigation and research, and was very blind. For example, the 19 bridge and tunnel projects proposed by the Tumen and Ludao engineering sections were only investigated for two projects by the bureau's engineering department before a hasty decision was made. In fact, several "most important" culvert repair projects proposed by the Tumen engineering section were not as "important" as the secondary projects of the Ludao engineering section. The Liaoyuan engineering section proposed a 55-kilometer river channel modification project on the Siping-Fuhekou line. The river had already naturally changed its course, but the section still proposed a river channel modification project. Another example is the sand spreading project at the marshalling station. The Chaoyangchuan station had already been paved with furnace ash by the engineering section, the Jiaohe and Liaoyuan stations had also been paved, and the Tonghua station had paved a portion, but the transportation department subjectively proposed a sand spreading project plan. Secondly, there is a serious disconnect between the bureau's housing construction projects and actual needs. For example, at the Sanchazi station on the Hunjiang-Sanchazi line, many employees do not have houses to live in, but the plan only calls for the construction of one bureau house. Employees at Xiaocheng station all have houses to live in, but the Jilin Construction Section plans to repair two houses at that station. Furthermore, the idea of ​​"everything is waiting to be rebuilt" is also growing. For example, the entire bureau plans to build 15 new switch operator houses, but only four of them really need to be built, and the rest can continue to be used for more than a year. The wooden toilet at Longjing station can be used for at least three to five years, but there are also plans to rebuild it with bricks. The bridge and tunnel section of the engineering department plans to build eight "open tunnels" on the Ya-Da line (Tonghua to Dalizi) to prevent falling rocks. In reality, only one or two trains pass here every day, and it can be solved by simply dispatching stone-prying workers to guard the area, without the need for such a large investment.

    吉林铁路管理局检查明年基本建设计划
    发现许多不急需的工程项目也列入了计划
    吉林铁路管理局为了正确编制一九五四年基本建设工程计划，最近组成检查组，有重点地到现场检查了今年六月间编制的一九五四年度基本建设工程计划轮廓，检查的工程占全部计划工程的百分之六十八。在检查中，发现不需要的工程竟达此次检查数的百分之三十四以上。
    检查中发现比较突出的问题首先是今年六月间的计划缺乏调查研究，盲目性很大。例如图们、鹿道两工务段提出的十九件桥梁隧道工程，该局工务处只调查了两件就草率作了决定。其实图们工务段所提“最紧要”的几处涵渠修复工程，还赶不上鹿道工务段的次要工程更为“紧要”。辽源工务段四平、抚河口线五十五公里改河道工程，该河已自然改道了，但该段又提出了改河道的工程。又如编组站站场布砂工程，朝阳川站已由工务段铺了炉灰，蛟河、辽源站也已铺好，通化站铺了一部分，但车务部门却主观地提了布砂工程计划。其次，局宅修建工程方面存在着严重的与实际需要脱节的现象。例如浑江、三岔子线的三岔子车站现有许多职工没有房子住，但计划只修建一栋局宅。小城站职工都有房子住，而吉林建筑段却计划在该站修复两栋房子。还有，“百废俱兴”的思想也在滋长。如全局计划新建扳道房十五座，其中只有四座是真正需要修建的，其余的都能继续使用一年以上。龙井站的木制厕所至少还能用三五年，但也计划改建砖造的。工程处桥隧科计划在鸭大线（通化到大栗子）修建八处“明洞”防止落石。实际这里每天只过一两趟车，只需派撬石工人守护即可解决，不需要这样大量的投资。
