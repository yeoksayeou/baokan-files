Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 18th: The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean Military Armistice Commission issued the following communiqué on the 18th:

After the failure of the US side's plot to indefinitely delay the explanation work and after it was forced to construct explanation facilities, the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work for Korean-Chinese prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated finally began on October 15th. However, because the US side is directing a large number of special agents to inhumanely and violently prevent Korean-Chinese prisoners of war from coming to listen to explanations and apply for repatriation, and is doing everything possible to disrupt the explanation work, the explanation work stipulated in the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" of the Armistice Agreement cannot proceed normally.

The "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" of the Armistice Agreement and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work" formulated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission accordingly clearly stipulate that every prisoner of war must listen to the explanation. However, a large number of Chiang and Li special agents, deployed by the US side in various prisoner-of-war camps under Indian army guard, are abducting prisoners of war and preventing them from going to listen to the explanation. As a result, the explanation work on October 15th actually only lasted for three and a half hours, and the explanation work on October 16th could not be carried out at all. On October 15th, before the Korean-Chinese explanation representatives gave explanations to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war in the 31st camp, the special agents in that camp had made detailed arrangements to prevent the prisoners of war from applying for repatriation. Special agent elements posing as prisoner-of-war representatives openly demanded to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission that prisoners of war who listened to the explanation, regardless of whether they applied for repatriation or not, must return to their original camps, that is, return to the control of these special agents and be subjected to their abuse and murder. The special agents openly used this as a condition for allowing prisoners of war to listen to the explanation, and told the prisoners of war that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission had agreed to this condition, making the prisoners of war afraid to apply for repatriation at all. The prisoners of war who listened to the explanation were also arranged in a certain order, with special agents interspersed among them. A senior special agent announced: If the one in front doesn't shout "not going back" after entering the explanation tent, the one behind must rush in and kill him, otherwise the one behind will be killed. Liu Wenjie, the deputy captain of the special agent detachment in that camp, also threatened all the prisoners of war, saying: If anyone wants to return to the country, blow the bugle to charge, and everyone should rush up and kill him.

On the other hand, the US side also used a large number of Chiang Kai-shek reactionary remnant elements who did not belong to the Korean belligerent party at all in the explanation tents, appearing as US translators and representatives. These Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs are precisely the special agents who have long entrenched themselves in the US prisoner-of-war camps, oppressing and persecuting prisoners of war with inhumane atrocities. They and other US observer representatives openly violated the provisions of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work," constantly interrupting the explanation work, even openly directing special agents mixed among the prisoners of war to beat the explanation representatives, and threatening the prisoners of war not to apply for repatriation. In addition, from the first day of the explanation work, US military aircraft have been constantly circling over the custodial area. On the morning of October 17th, the US side also deliberately dropped two bombs on Height 155, which is close to the custodial area, attempting to use these "shows of force" to intimidate the prisoners of war.

It must be pointed out that these Korean-Chinese prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated have personally experienced and witnessed the various persecutions suffered by those who requested repatriation in the US prisoner-of-war camps for the past two or three years; the US side has also forcibly tattooed them and forced them to join various reactionary organizations, while creating various rumors to intimidate them, making it impossible for them to freely express their will to return home. The reason why the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" clearly stipulate that these prisoners of war should be released into the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, eliminating all US control and influence over them, and that the Korean-Chinese side should conduct explanations and interviews with them, is to enable these prisoners of war to gradually eliminate the fears they have accumulated for a long time during their captivity, to understand that they have the full right to return home and live a peaceful life, and to truly obtain the opportunity to apply for repatriation. But in fact, these prisoners of war, according to their original organization under US detention, were sent to the custody of the Indian army, and the Chiang and Li special agent organizations originally deployed by the US side were also incorporated into the prisoner-of-war camps under Indian army guard without any change, and intensified their special agent terror rule in the prisoner-of-war camps. The Indian army can only patrol outside the prisoner-of-war camps, and the prisoner-of-war camps are entirely the world of special agents. Therefore, in the dozens of days since these prisoners of war were transferred to the custody of the Indian army, they discovered that those who ruled them were still the same special agents who persecuted them in the US prisoner-of-war camps, and those who requested repatriation were still being wantonly abused and murdered. This special agent terror rule in the camp made it impossible for them to obtain the protection of the Indian army, and made them think that even under the custody of the Indian army, applying for repatriation was not guaranteed at all.

Regarding the various illegal sabotage activities carried out by the US side in the explanation process, the Korean-Chinese side has lodged the most serious protests to the US side at the Military Armistice Commission. In addition, in view of the destruction by the US side and its special agent pawns, which has made it impossible for the Korean-Chinese side to conduct eight hours of explanation work every day in accordance with the regulations of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for the past two or three days, the Korean-Chinese side firmly believes that the ninety-day explanation period, which was agreed upon by the two sides of the Korean armistice after long negotiations and expressly stipulated by the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," should be calculated based on the actual time spent on explanation work.

### 解释工作因美方特务进行  破坏无法正常进行朝中代表团发表公报要求制止美方非法活动  并认为九十天解释期限应按实际进行解释工作的时间计算

    解释工作因美方特务进行
    破坏无法正常进行朝中代表团发表公报要求制止美方非法活动
    并认为九十天解释期限应按实际进行解释工作的时间计算
    【新华社开城十八日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中代表团十八日发表公报如下：
    在美方企图无限期拖延解释工作的阴谋遭到失败，不能不修建解释设备以后，朝中方面对不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员的解释工作，终于在十月十五日宣告开始。但由于美方正指挥大批特务以惨无人道的暴力阻挠朝中被俘人员前来听取解释和申请遣返，千方百计破坏解释工作，使停战协定“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”中所规定的解释工作无法正常进行。
    停战协定“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和中立国遣返委员会据此而制定的“解释和访问工作细则”明白规定：每一战俘必须听取解释。但美方布置在印军看管下各战俘营内的大批蒋、李特务，竟劫持战俘，不让他们前往听取解释。因此，十月十五日的解释工作实际上只进行了三小时半，十月十六日的解释工作则根本未能进行。在十月十五日朝中解释代表向第三十一营场的志愿军被俘人员进行解释前，该营场的特务更曾作了周密的布置，以阻挠战俘申请遣返。冒充战俘代表的特务分子公开向中立国遣返委员会要求听取解释后的战俘不论申请遣返与否都必须回到原营场，也就是说要回到这些特务分子的控制之下，任其虐杀。特务分子公开以此为允许战俘听取解释的条件，并向战俘扬言中立国遣返委员会已应允此项条件，使战俘根本不敢申请遣返。听取解释的战俘们并被排成一定的次序，其中安插好特务，由大特务宣布：凡是前面的一个进解释帐篷后不大叫大嚷“不回去”，后面的一个就要冲进去打死他，否则后面的一个将被打死。该营场的特务大队副刘文杰还威胁全体战俘说：假使有人要回国，就吹冲锋号，大家应冲上去打死他。
    另一方面，美方在解释帐篷内又使用了大批根本不属于朝鲜交战一方的蒋介石反动残余分子，以美方的翻译和代表的面目出现。这些蒋介石匪帮正是长期盘踞在美方战俘营中以灭绝人性的暴行欺压和迫害战俘的特务。他们和美方的其他观察代表公然违反“解释和访问工作细则”的规定，在解释工作中不断打断解释工作，甚至公开指挥混在战俘中的特务殴打解释代表，并威胁战俘不得申请遣返。此外从解释工作开始的第一天起，美方军用飞机即时时盘旋于看管地区的上空。十月十七日上午，美方还故意在紧靠看管地区的一五五高地投下两枚炸弹，企图用这些“武力示威”来恐吓战俘。
    必须指出：这些不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员，二、三年来在美方战俘营中曾亲身经历过、也亲眼看到要求遣返者所遭受的种种迫害；美方也曾对他们实行强迫刺字，并强迫他们加入各种反动组织，同时制造各种谣言，来恫吓他们，这就使他们无法自由表达其要求回家的意志。“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”之所以明确规定应将这些战俘释交中立国遣返委员会看管，摒除美方对他们的一切控制和影响，并由朝中方面向他们进行解释与访问，就是为了要使这些战俘得以逐渐消除其在被俘期间所长期积累的疑惧，了解到他们有回家过和平生活的完全权利，并真正获得申请遣返的机会。但事实上，这些战俘按照原来在美方拘留下的编制，被送交印度军队看管后，美方原所布置的蒋、李特务组织也就原封不动地混入印度军队看管下的战俘营，并在战俘营中变本加厉地实施其特务的恐怖统治。印度军队只能在战俘营外巡逻，战俘营内完全是特务的世界。因此，这些战俘在被移交印度军队看管后的几十天来，发现统治他们的还是原来在美方战俘营中迫害他们的那些特务，而要求遣返者也仍被肆无忌惮地虐杀。营内的这种特务恐怖统治，使他们无法得到印度军队的保护，并使他们以为即使在印度军队看管下要申请遣返，也毫无保障。
    对于美方在解释工作过程中所进行的各种非法破坏活动，朝中方面已在军事停战委员会上向美方提出最严重的抗议。此外，鉴于美方及其特务爪牙的破坏，已使朝中方面二、三天来无法根据中立国遣返委员会的规定每天进行八小时的解释工作，因此，朝中方面坚决认为：朝鲜停战双方经过长期谈判而达成协议并由“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”予以明文规定的九十天解释期限，应按实际进行解释工作的时间来计算。
