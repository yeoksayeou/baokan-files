The forty-first Chinese edition of the Cominform newspaper "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "Bastion of All Peace-Loving Forces in Germany" to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. The editorial points out that the German Democratic Republic is a reliable pillar for the German people in their struggle for a peaceful solution to the German problem. Its mission is to play a historic role in the cause of establishing a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany. The German Democratic Republic has made tremendous achievements in peaceful construction over the past four years. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany has united all the patriotic forces of the Republic to carry out a victorious struggle for unification, peace, and against imperialist provocations. All progressive mankind believes that the further consolidation of the German Democratic Republic is an important condition for the thorough resolution of the German question.

Important articles in this issue include: "Raising the Level of Party Work is a Guarantee for the Victorious Completion of Socialist Construction Tasks" by A. Moghioroș, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party; "The French Communist Party's Factory Branch Newspaper Struggles for the Vital Demands of the Working People" by M. Vandel, Member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party; and "Some Problems in the Organizational Work of the Polish United Workers' Party" by A. Alster, Member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party.

Moghioroș's article expounds on the resolution on "Improving Party Work and Strengthening the Ties Between the Party and the Masses" adopted by the expanded meeting of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party in August. The article points out that whether the Party's line of socialist construction can be realized depends on the organizational and political work of the Party's leading organs, on how the Party's leading organs rely on the Party's activists, on the masses of Party members and non-Party people in their activities, on how the Party's leading organs mobilize them and use their initiative, and on whether they pay attention to criticism from below.

Alster's article also discusses the important significance of strengthening the Party's organizational work for mobilizing the masses to complete the national economic plan. Combining specific examples, he analyzes the problems of local organizations at all levels of the Polish United Workers' Party in strengthening collective leadership, strengthening leadership over rural branches, improving the political level of cadres, and strengthening agitation and organizational work. Alster pointed out that Party organizations at all levels must fully combine mass political work with the completion of production plans, activate the political life of Party organizations, and stimulate the initiative of Party and non-Party activists to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the national economic plan.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第四十一期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”第四十一期中文版已经出版。
    本期发表了题为“全德国爱好和平力量的堡垒”的社论，以庆祝德意志民主共和国建国四周年。社论指出，德意志民主共和国是德国人民在争取和平解决德国问题的斗争中的可靠支柱。它的使命就是在建立统一、爱好和平和民主的德国的事业中起历史性的作用。德意志民主共和国四年来在和平建设方面已有了巨大的成就。德国统一社会党已把共和国的一切爱国力量团结起来，进行争取统一、和平、反对帝国主义挑衅的胜利斗争。全体进步人类认为，德意志民主共和国的进一步巩固是彻底解决德国问题的重要条件。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记亚·莫吉奥罗希的“提高党工作的水平是胜利完成社会主义建设任务的保证”，法国共产党中央委员密·范德尔的“法国共产党工厂支部报纸为劳动人民的切身要求而斗争”，波兰统一工人党中央委员会委员安·阿尔斯特尔的“波兰统一工人党党内组织工作的若干问题”。
    莫吉奥罗希的文章阐述了罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会八月扩大会议所通过的关于“改进党的工作，密切党和群众的联系”的决议。文章指出，党的建设社会主义的路线能否实现，要看党的领导机关的组织工作和政治工作，要看党的领导机关如何在活动中依靠党的活动分子、依靠党员群众和非党群众，要看党的领导机关怎样发动他们和利用他们的积极性，以及是否注意自下而上的批评。
    阿尔斯特尔的文章也谈到了加强党的组织工作对于发动群众完成国民经济计划的重要意义。他结合了具体事例，分析了波兰统一工人党的地方各级组织在加强集体领导、加强对农村支部的领导、提高干部政治水平以及加强鼓动工作与组织工作等方面的问题。阿尔斯特尔指出：各级党组织必须充分地把群众政治工作和完成生产计划结合起来，使党组织的政治生活活跃起来，激发党与非党积极分子的主动性，以保证国民经济计划的完成和超额完成。
