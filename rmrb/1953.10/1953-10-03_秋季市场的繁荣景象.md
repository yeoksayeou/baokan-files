　　Shanghai East Station Experiences Unprecedentedly Frequent Freight Traffic

　　Shanghai East Railway Station is the gateway for Shanghai's land freight and has always been busy. This autumn, the station is experiencing an unprecedentedly bustling scene in its forty-year history.

　　The six long platforms are often piled high with goods ready to be shipped to various destinations. Here, one can often see: thermos bottles heading to Lanzhou, rubber shoes, and woolen clothes and gloves being transferred to the Northeast tightly packed together; the calico needed by Kunming has not yet been loaded into the carriages, and beside it, trucks of yarn being transferred to Beijing are waiting to be unloaded onto the platform. In the yard, on dozens of crisscrossing tracks, carriages loaded with goods pass by almost every minute. Among them are carriages going to Xi'an, Anshan, Guangzhou...; after carriages loaded with boots and shoes being transferred to pastoral areas in Inner Mongolia have just passed, carriages loaded with wool and blankets for all ethnic groups in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang are speeding away.

　　At the same time, trains carrying materials from other places are also constantly arriving here. Trains loaded with large quantities of timber from the Northeast forest area, trains carrying cotton from the cotton-producing areas of Henan, and trains carrying Chinese cabbage from Wuxi...; trains from all directions are carrying large quantities of materials here to supply the needs of Shanghai's industrial production.

　　Busy Freight Traffic on the Xiaoqing River

　　The Xiaoqing River area of Shandong Province entered its most prosperous season of the year in early September. Every day, hundreds of large and small wooden boats loaded with materials travel back and forth on the river. The Huangtai Wharf in the suburbs of Jinan ships 200-300 tons of materials eastward every day, including new agricultural tools, fertilizers, coal, kerosene, cloth, and other daily necessities. These industrial products from Shanghai, Qingdao, and Jinan are transported along the river to the vast rural areas of Licheng, Gaoqing, Huantai, Zouping, Qidong, Boxing, Guangrao, and Shouguang counties. Grain, cottonseed, oils, seafood, earth nitrate, reed products, and sea salt from Yangjiaogou produced in the counties along the river, about 200 tons per day, are transported to Jinan and the small and medium-sized towns along the river; earth nitrate and many other local and special products are also sold to Shanghai, the Northeast, and Guangdong.

　　State-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in the Xiaoqing River area are busy shipping large quantities of industrial products to the countryside to supply farmers in various places. For example, the state-owned Coal and Building Materials Company recently transported a large amount of briquette coal from various coal mines in Boshan to supply farmers in cotton and tobacco producing areas such as Qidong and Boxing.

　　Not Slack in the Off-Season, Even Busier in the Peak Season

　　Due to the good harvest of crops in the surrounding areas, the increase in national economic construction investment, and the gradual improvement of people's lives, the Chongqing market has changed the phenomenon of declining transactions in the off-season in the past; the peak trade season has arrived early, and public and private commercial transactions are even more prosperous. Since September, the Central Store of the Chongqing Municipal Company of China Department Store has been crowded with people choosing various commodities from eight o'clock in the morning to ten o'clock at night every day. The store supplies the people with more than 30 tons of various large and small department stores, wool, yarn, calico, cotton cloth and other commodities every day, which can fill more than ten trucks.

　　Since September, the turnover of public and private commerce in Chongqing has increased by 47.51% compared with early August, and 50% compared with the same period last year. Among them, the sales volume of sugar has increased three times compared with the same period last year, rubber shoes increased two times, cloth increased by 91%, and wool and yarn increased even more. The turnover of private businesses in the city has also increased significantly, generally increasing by 20% to 40% compared with the same period last year.

　　Such strong purchasing power of the masses and such a prosperous season of transactions have never been seen in the Chongqing market in previous years.

　　Doing a Business You Can't Keep Up With

　　Changsha's Niehou Street is a street where small commodity factories and stores are concentrated. These factories and stores have old customers from many counties, towns, and villages throughout Hunan Province. Now that the happy harvest season in the countryside has arrived, Niehou Street has become particularly lively. Farmers and peddlers from various counties, villages, and towns come to buy goods, carrying bags and baskets, carefully selecting various small commodities from this store to that.

　　Some of the stores on Niehou Street have been open for decades. When asked about the "business history" of Niehou Street, they count and say: from the late Qing Dynasty to the decades of reactionary rule by the Kuomintang, they have never done as good business as in the past few years since liberation. The owner of Shangji Zhai Hat Shop happily talked to visitors about the hat business. He said: Compared with last year, blue work hats, cotton hats, children's hats, and small bibs are always in short supply. Many customers pay first and then pick up the goods. The first half of this year was the so-called "off-season," but there was also a surplus; now that the peak season has arrived, producing 480 dozen a month is still not enough to meet demand. The owner and workers of Chen Taiji Hat Shop scrambled to tell visitors: Our business is very good. Several hat shops and hat industry joint ventures on Niehou Street can produce 6,000 dozen hats a month, but still cannot meet customer needs. This year's early rice and mid-season rice harvests are good, and business is even more overwhelming!

　　Sell More Grain, Buy More Industrial Products

　　Recently, the sheds and open spaces of the grain purchasing station in Shuangliu County, Sichuan Province, have been filled with farmers' baskets and carts loaded with grain; people are constantly talking, laughing, inquiring, and telling each other about this year's good harvest. At the same time, state-owned department stores and cooperatives are crowded with farmers buying agricultural tools, fertilizers, cloth, and general merchandise. The turnover of the Shuangliu County Department Store sales department in early September was 160 million yuan, an increase of more than 50 million yuan compared with early August, and more than 70 million yuan compared with the same period last year. The Chengguan No. 1 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative sold more than 3,000 jin of bone fertilizer and more than 2,000 jin of broad bean seeds in just three days from September 10 to 12.

　　After selling grain and buying goods, the farmers, after calculating carefully, all said: "This year the price of grain has indeed increased, and the price of industrial products has indeed decreased!" Yang Maoting, a farmer from Village 8 of Weixin Township, bought half a bolt of worker-peasant blue cloth at the department store, using seven dou of rice, while last year it would have cost more than eight dou of rice. Many farmers are planning: sell more grain and buy more industrial products.

　　The Towns on Both Sides of the Jingjiang River Become Lively

　　The newly built Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project and the reinforced Jingjiang Embankment protect the safety and production of farmers along the Jingjiang River. In the past two years, most areas along the Jingjiang River have achieved two consecutive good harvests. Mianyang and Honghu counties, which have always been known as "Mianyang Shahuzhou, nine out of ten years with no harvest," have increased rice production by an average of more than 30% this year compared with last year.

　　With the good harvest on both sides of the Jingjiang River, the towns on both sides of the Jingjiang River have become lively and prosperous. On the roads leading to each town, the number of carts, donkeys, and burdens has increased, and the number of small wooden boats in the river has also increased. Farmers are going to the towns to sell the newly harvested grain and cotton to the state, and exchange them for cattle, plows, waterwheels, hoes, cotton gins, fertilizers, oil, salt, cloth, and general merchandise. The Shashi Limin Machine Factory, which repairs, manufactures, and modifies cotton gins for farmers, has been working day and night since the autumn harvest, but is still unable to meet demand.

    秋季市场的繁荣景象
    上海东站货运空前频繁
    上海东火车站是上海陆路货运的门户，货运历来频繁。今年秋季，这个车站更出现了建站四十多年来从所未有的热闹景象。
    六条长月台，经常满堆着准备运往各地的物资。在这里，人们时常可以看见：运向兰州的热水瓶、橡胶鞋和调往东北的绒衣、手套等紧紧地挤在一起；昆明需要的花布还没有装进车厢，旁边便有一卡车一卡车调往北京的绒线在等着卸上月台。车场内，数十条纵横交错的铁轨上，几乎每分钟都有满载货物的车厢驰过。其中有到西安的、到鞍山的、到广州的……；满载着调往内蒙牧区的靴鞋的车厢刚刚驶过，为新疆天山南北路各族人民装运呢绒、毛毯的车厢又跟着疾驰而去。
    同时，其他地方载运物资的火车也不断来到这里。满载着大量木材远从东北林区开来的列车，从河南棉区运来棉花的列车，从无锡运来大白菜的列车……；四面八方来的列车都载运着大批的物资来到这里，供应上海工业生产的需要。
      小清河上货运繁忙
    山东省小清河地区在九月初就进入了一年当中最繁荣的季节。每天有数百只大小木船满载物资在河上往来航行。济南郊区黄台码头每天有二、三百吨物资装船东下，其中有新式农具、肥料、煤、煤油、布匹和其他日用百货。这些来自上海、青岛和济南等地的工业品沿河运销到历城、高青、桓台、邹平、齐东、博兴、广饶和寿光等县的广大农村去。沿河各县出产的粮食、棉籽、油类、海产鱼虾、土硝、苇货和羊角沟的海盐，每天约有二百吨运往济南以及沿河的中、小城镇；土硝等许多土产、特产品还远销上海、东北和广东等地。
    小清河地区的国营商业部门和合作社都在忙着装运大批工业品下乡，供应各地农民。如国营煤业建筑器材公司最近从博山各煤矿运了大量烧煤，供应齐东和博兴等产棉、产烟地区的农民。
                              （据新华社讯）
      淡季不淡，旺季更旺
    重庆市场今年由于附近地区农作物丰收，国家经济建设投资增加，人民生活逐渐提高，改变了过去淡季交易下降的现象；贸易旺季提早到来，公私商业交易更加兴旺。中国百货公司重庆市公司中心商店九月份以来，每天从早晨八点钟到夜晚十点钟，整天都有川流不息的人群来选购各种商品。该商店每天供应人民的各种大、小百货和毛呢、毛线、花布、棉布等商品有三十多吨，可装十多辆卡车。
    九月以来，重庆市公私商业的营业额比八月上旬增加百分之四十七点五一，比去年同时期增加百分之五十。其中食糖的销售量比去年同时期增加三倍，胶鞋增加两倍，布匹增加百分之九十一，毛呢、毛线增加更多。全市私营商业的营业额也有显著增加，一般比去年同时期增加百分之二十到四十。
    群众这样强大的购买力，交易这样旺盛的季节，是重庆市场上历年来所没有过的。
      做不赢的好生意
    长沙市臬后街是小百货工厂、商店集中的一条街。这些工厂、商店拥有来自湖南全省许多县城、集镇、农村的老顾客。现在农村充满欢乐的收获季节已经来临，臬后街也就特别热闹起来。从各县乡村、集镇来买货的农民和小贩，背着袋子，挑着篾篓，从这家到那家，仔细地选购各种小百货。
    臬后街上的商店有的开了几十年，提起臬后街的“生意史”，他们便数着说：从清朝末年到国民党反动统治的几十年中，从来没有做过像解放以来这几年的好生意。上吉斋帽庄的老板喜笑颜开地向访问者谈着帽子生意。他说：拿去年打比，蓝色工作帽、棉帽、童帽、小围涎总是做不赢，顾客们很多是先交钱，后拿货。今年上半年是所谓“淡月”，可是也有盈余；现在旺月来了，一个月生产四百八十打还是供不应求。陈泰记帽庄的老板和工人们抢着告诉访问者：我们的生意好得很。臬后街几家帽店和帽工业联营处一个月可以出产六千打帽子，还是不能满足顾客需要。今年早稻、中稻收成好，生意越发做不赢！
      多卖粮食，多买工业品
    近来四川省双流县粮食收购站的凉棚下、空场上，排满了农民们装着粮食的箩筐和车子；人们不断地说着、笑着，彼此询问和互相告诉今年丰收的情况。同时，国营百货公司和合作社里，又挤满了购买农具、肥料和布匹、百货的农民。双流县百货公司门市部九月上旬的营业额是一亿六千余万元，比八月上旬增加了五千多万元，比去年同时期增加了七千多万元。城关一区供销合作社仅在九月十日到十二日三天内，就卖出骨肥三千多斤，葫豆种籽两千多斤。
    卖了粮又买了货的农民，算过细账后都说：“今年粮价确实提高了，工业品价钱的确降低了！”维新乡八村农民杨茂廷在百货公司买了半匹工农蓝布，用了七斗米，而在去年就要八斗多米。许多农民在盘算着：多卖些粮食，多买些工业品。
      荆江两岸的集镇热闹起来了
    新修的荆江分洪工程和加固的荆江大堤，保卫着荆江沿岸农民的安全和生产。两年来，荆江两岸大部地区连续获得两个丰收。一向被称为“沔阳沙湖洲，十年九不收”的沔阳、洪湖两县，今年水稻平均比去年增产三成以上。
    随着荆江两岸的丰收，荆江两岸的集镇已经热闹繁荣起来。在通往每个集镇的道路上，来往的手推车、驴子、担子增多了，河道内的小木船也增多了。农民们纷纷到集镇去把新收的粮食、棉花卖给国家，换回耕牛、犁耙、水车、锄头、轧花机、肥料和油盐、布匹、百货等。为农民修配和制造轧花机的沙市利民机器厂，秋收以来日夜开工，仍供不应求。（据新华社讯）
