    Greetings to the Chinese People

    Two years ago, I was a member of the Hungarian delegation invited to attend the celebrations for the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Two years have passed since that visit to China.
    I will never forget that night. I felt immensely honored to be able to clink glasses with Comrade Mao Zedong and other members of the Chinese government. The atmosphere in that hall was happy and joyful. I saw the most advanced sons and daughters of a great nation: the leaders and heroes of a victorious revolution, the outstanding workers of an ancient nation regaining its youth, and the best warriors striving for the progress of their nation. People were eating, drinking, and laughing, and they were clearly moved, with tears of joy glistening in their eyes.
    The next day, October 1st, I saw an even more magnificent sight. Mao Zedong stood in the middle of the Tiananmen review stand, and the masses in the square cheered him enthusiastically. I also saw the neat rows of troops and heard their disciplined and firm footsteps. From 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., the crowds kept pouring into the square, holding tens of millions of bouquets of flowers, and the square was filled with magnificent cheers. I also saw the laughing faces of the children, and I will never forget the beautiful and colorful Chinese characters they formed with flowers.
    I learned about the strength and vigilance of the Chinese people, their joy in construction, their daily hard work, their unwavering faith in the fraternal solidarity of all nations, and their internationalist spirit of using manpower and material resources to aid Korea. I visited cities and villages, and in the crowds, I carefully observed people's faces, from which you can learn a lot. When we visited a rural area, they were celebrating the victory of the land reform. By the side of the rostrum, bonfires were lit, and people were burning the old feudal land deeds, loan receipts, contracts for selling children, etc., which were symbols of their entire past of oppression and enslavement. When the emancipated peasants received their land certificates, the cheers were deafening. People's faces were flushed with excitement, their eyes shining with happiness, gongs and drums were constantly sounding, and flags were fluttering in the breeze.
    Generally, Europeans have wanted to see the Orient since childhood, feeling that the Orient is an incredible world of dreams, a strange foreign place. As Hungarians, we have a nostalgic yearning for the Orient. The oldest themes of our folk music and folk traditions are closely related to the Orient. We yearn for the Orient as a child longs for his hometown and childhood. I found many familiar things in Chinese music. When I visited factories and schools, what impressed me most was not the unfamiliar things, but the similarities with our country. The basic problems of our two countries are the same. In land reform, agricultural collectivization, national industrialization, and cultural revolution—that is, all aspects of life—the problems and difficulties we face are very similar.
    I have visited libraries, museums, and schools, and I have talked with writers, scientists, artists, children, and soldiers. I have seen Chinese new and old operas, attended concerts, and watched movies. As a poet, I have also studied the main problems of Chinese new literature. I welcome their achievements with fraternal joy and pride, and I have always looked at Chinese new literature with the same feeling. I believe that Chinese artists and writers are best at using their beautiful traditions and can create beautiful and harmonious works with Chinese national forms and socialist content.
    I have talked with workers. After liberation, their lives have greatly improved, and their consciousness has also been raised. I especially remember Song Chunhua, a worker at the Tianjin Paper Mill. He is a model worker, a very healthy and happy person. When we met him, he kept talking about the factory and was unwilling to talk about himself. He had been working in this paper mill since he was fifteen years old, when he was an ordinary worker with a meager salary. He liked technology very much, and whenever he had time, he buried himself in studying it, but he didn't dare let people know that he was studying technology hard, because he was afraid that people would fire him, and he dared not easily lose the job that only provided one meal a day. After liberation, his skills and abilities amazed people. He modified the machine so that it could use local raw materials. He experimented hard day and night and achieved great success. He met Chairman Mao and was awarded the title of labor hero. He had never been so happy in the past.
    After returning from China, I have indelible impressions of this visit. In all parts of Hungary, our people have repeatedly asked me to talk about what I saw and heard in China. As long as friends know that I have been to China, they ask me so many questions that I can't answer them all.
    Our people love and respect the liberated Chinese people. The great National Day of the Chinese people is coming again. Together with all the Hungarian people, I would like to extend warm congratulations to the fraternal Chinese people and wish them greater success, more happiness and joy.

### 向中国人民祝贺

    向中国人民祝贺
    匈牙利作家协会秘书长
    柯树特奖金获得者
    孔尼亚·拉约士
    两年前，匈牙利代表团应邀参加中华人民共和国成立两周年的庆祝典礼，我是该团的团员之一。自从我那次访问中国之后，两年已经过去了。
    我永远也忘不了那一夜。我能够和毛泽东同志及中国政府其他委员们碰杯，使我感到莫大的光荣。那间大厅的气氛是幸福愉快的。我看见了伟大的民族最先进的儿女：已获胜利的革命的领袖和英雄，重又获得青春的古老民族的杰出工人，为了自己民族的进步而奋斗的最优秀的战士。人们吃着、喝着、笑着，他们显然是被感动了，他们的眼睛里闪烁着快乐的眼泪。
    第二天，十月一日，我看见了更宏伟的景象。毛泽东站在天安门检阅台的当中，广场上的群众向他热烈欢呼。我也看见军队整齐的行列，听见他们有纪律的坚定的步伐声。从上午十一时到下午四时，人群不断地拥向广场，他们拿着千万把花束，广场上响彻了雄壮的欢呼声。我也看见孩子们欢笑的脸，我忘不了他们用鲜花组成的美丽的五彩中国字。
    我了解到中国人民的力量和警觉、他们建设的喜悦、他们每日努力的劳动、他们对于各国人民兄弟般团结的不可动摇的信心，以及他们用人力和物力去援助朝鲜的国际主义精神。我参观了城市和农村，在人群中，我仔细观察人们的面孔，从这里你可以了解许多的东西。当我们参观一个农村的时候，那里正在庆祝土地改革的胜利。在主席台边，点起了篝火，人们在那里焚毁古老的封建的地契、借据、卖儿女的合同等，这些东西就是他们过去整个被压迫被奴役的命运的象征。当翻身农民接到他们的土地证的时候，真是欢声震天。人们的脸兴奋得发红了，眼睛闪着幸福的光辉，锣鼓声不断响着，旗帜在微风中飘扬。
    一般欧洲人从小就想看看东方，觉得东方是梦想中不可思议的世界，一个奇怪的外国地方。作为匈牙利人，我们对于东方却有一种思家情绪的向往。我国民间音乐和民间传统最古老的题材就和东方有着密切的关系。我们向往着东方，如同小孩想念他的故乡和童年那样殷切。我在中国音乐中发现许多熟悉的东西。在我参观工厂和学校的时候，给我印象最深的不是那些生疏的东西，而是与我国相似的地方。我们两国的基本问题是一样的。在土地改革、农业集体化、国家工业化和文化革命——这就是生活的各方面了——等等，我们两国所遇到的问题和困难都是非常相似的。
    我参观过图书馆、博物馆和学校，我和作家、科学家、艺术家、儿童、战士们谈过话。我看了中国的新旧歌剧，参加了音乐会，看了电影。我也以诗人的身分研究了中国新文学作品的主要问题。我以兄弟般的欢欣和自豪来欢迎他们的成就，我至今一直是怀着同样的心情来看中国新文学，我知道在这一方面我们的问题也是共同的。我认为中国艺术家和作家最善于利用他们优美的传统，并且能用中国的民族形式和社会主义的内容创造出优美和谐的作品来。
    我和工人谈过话。解放后，他们的生活大大地提高了，他们的觉悟也提高了。我特别记得天津造纸厂的工人宋春化。他是劳动模范，一个非常健康愉快的人。我们会见他的时候，他一直谈工厂的事，不愿谈他自己。他从十五岁起，就在这个造纸厂做工，那时他是一个普通工人，工资少得可怜。他非常喜欢技术，只要有功夫，就埋头钻研，但是他不敢让人知道他在苦学技术，因为他害怕人家会辞退他，他不敢轻易失掉那个每天仅供一顿饭的职业。解放后，他的技术和能力使人们大吃一惊，他改装了机器，使它能够利用本地的原料。他日夜苦苦地试验，获得了很大的成功。他见了毛主席，获得了劳动英雄的称号。在过去，他从没有得到过这样幸福。
    从中国回来后，我对于这次访问旅行留下了不能磨灭的印象。在匈牙利各地，我国人民一再地叫我讲讲我在中国的见闻。只要朋友们知道我到过中国，他们就问我许许多多的问题，使我应接不暇。
    我国人民热爱解放了的中国人民并且尊敬他们。中国人民伟大的国庆节日又来到了，我和全体匈牙利人民一道，谨向兄弟般的中国人民热烈地祝贺，希望他们获得更大的成功，更多的快乐和幸福。
