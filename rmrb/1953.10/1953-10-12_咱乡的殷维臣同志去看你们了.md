A Message to the Soldiers

Comrade Yin Weichen from Our Village is Visiting You
An Peisen, Secretary of the Huangtugang Township Branch of the Communist Party of China, Fengtai District, Beijing

Dear Volunteer Army Comrades,

On National Day, we saw our Chairman Mao again in front of Tiananmen Square, and we saw the representatives you sent back. Chairman Mao is still so healthy, and your representatives are still so full of spirit. Comrades, it is because of Chairman Mao's good leadership, and because you fought so well, that we can do well in production and live good lives.

A few days ago, the Third National People's Delegation to Korea set off. Comrade Yin Weichen from our village also participated in the delegation to visit you in Korea. When he left, the enthusiasm with which everyone saw him off was truly something that couldn't be described in three days and two nights!

Speaking of Yin Weichen, there's a long story to tell. He is a Communist Party member and also the director of the agricultural production cooperative in our village. The establishment of the cooperative was really not easy. Take Tian Changhe, the deputy director, for example. He joined the Party during the land reform and even served as the village head. But when life got better, he changed direction. He hired two and a half farmhands at home, and he himself became too lazy to even farm the land. He spent his days eating and drinking, and rarely paid attention to his work. The district committee learned about this and sent people to help him criticize his thinking. He also participated in a Party rectification training class the year before last, and his thinking gradually became clearer. Later, he and Yin Weichen planned to organize a production cooperative. However, his mother disagreed, and some other people were also a bit selfish, so Yin Weichen himself lost steam. When the higher-ups found out, they sent people to help again. The Party members held a self-criticism meeting first, discussed the methods, established a leading core, and the cooperative slowly began to pick up. There were a total of eight households in the cooperative, cultivating 117 mu of land, with 46 mu of irrigated land alone. With more people, it was easier to allocate labor. With more money, we had more funds. With more land, we could plant whatever we wanted. In addition to new farming techniques, more fertilizer, and good rainfall, the crops grew exceptionally well! In the first year, the yields of wheat, corn, cabbage, potatoes, etc., were the highest in the whole township. The high-yield cabbage field yielded more than 18,000 jin per mu, and potatoes also yielded more than 5,000 jin per mu. This kind of yield is among the best in the entire Beijing! In addition to sideline occupations, the annual income was equivalent to more than 890 shi of corn, and the net income per person was 1,430 jin, an increase of more than 64 percent compared to the past!

As a result, the farmers who had not joined the cooperative became envious, and more and more people asked to join. This spring, there were 34 member households in the cooperative, with 334 mu of land, 12 head of livestock, eight large carts, and complete farming tools. Among the members, there were eight Party members and one Youth League member. When it came to labor, everyone was outstanding. As soon as the sky brightened, the cooperative's bell rang, and the members ran to the cooperative from all directions, picked up their tools, and left. Zhang Yulin is a team leader, almost fifty years old, and he also took the lead in labor. Usually, he always did ten points of work a day, and this spring, when leveling the vegetable plots, he did thirteen points in one day! After working all day, he had to calculate the points for everyone in the evening and plan everyone's work for the next day, so he didn't go to bed until eleven o'clock. When the cooperative held awards in August, he even received a towel and a bar of soap!

The male members are like this, and the women are not behind either. Du Meiying is a 19-year-old Communist Party member and the director of the township women's federation. She can do almost anything in the fields or in the yard. Usually, she likes to challenge the men. If others look down on her, she would glare, puff out her chest, and say: "Don't look down on us women, we women can fly planes and drive trains, what about field work!" When pulling wheat this year, many female comrades clamored to compete with the men. Some male comrades deliberately teased them: "Still pulling wheat? Before you finish two rows, you'll all collapse!" However, Ma Yuying earned eleven points and five on the first day, which was even higher than some of the male comrades. This immediately added a lot of glory to them. Ding Dezhen is a fifteen-year-old girl, she says to everyone: "Do you still look down on us women? If you don't believe it, let's compete again!"

The Yin Weichen Agricultural Production Cooperative is like a big banner planted in our township, and others are happy to follow it. There are ten mutual aid teams that have been consolidated, and together with the cooperative, the number of organized households is close to half of the township. If there is any advanced experience, as long as the cooperative and mutual aid team test it successfully, others will follow suit. Our area is a semi-vegetable area, with more than 200 water wells, and after liberation, all of them were replaced with waterwheels, and one-third of the land can be irrigated. During droughts, the land that cannot be irrigated is planted by carrying water. This year's wheat yield increased by more than 10% on average compared to last year. The autumn crops are also very good. The "Golden Queen" corn grows more than a foot long, and the kernels are very full. The cabbage is even more lovely. The more than 30 mu of cabbage planted by the cooperative grow very fat, dark and green, and at a glance, it looks like a green mat. If there are no accidents, it is guaranteed to yield more than 20,000 jin per mu! At present, although the autumn harvest has not been fully completed, some land has been flooded for a few days, but overall, the yield is still more than 10% higher than last year.

Speaking of rainfall, it was a major disaster in our township before liberation. When the rainfall was heavy, more than 1,000 mu of land were submerged in water, which was waist-deep, and the water would stay for more than half a month. Corn yielded at most 40 jin per mu, and some houses were also flooded and collapsed. In the spring of 1950, we dug a drainage ditch more than five li long here, and this year it was lengthened a bit. The rainwater flows away as soon as it falls, and even the lowest-lying land can only accumulate water for two or three days. The drainage ditch is repaired once every spring, with contracted sections, and when the time comes, everyone goes. After the autumn harvest this year, we plan to dig it wider, so that no matter how heavy the rain falls, we won't be afraid!

Another reason why our crops are harvested well is: in June this year, when the wheat was about to ripen and the spring corn was also tasseling, suddenly, the township discovered corn borers. The leaves of the crops were covered with them, a pile of seventy or eighty. Spraying pesticide didn't work either. In those days, everyone went to the fields to catch insects. The female comrades who loved to sing didn't sing anymore. The tension was really like fighting American devils with you. Wei Tiangui, the deputy head of our township, had more than three mu of wheat that was about to be eaten up by the corn borers. Seeing that the insects were about to go to other people's fields to eat corn, he mobilized his whole family to take action, dug deep ditches around the land, and lured the insects into the ditches, eliminating them all in three days. He said: "Mine is finished, but others can't be ruined too!"

With more grain harvested, our lives are getting better. After liberation, more than 100 new houses have been added in the whole township, and almost every household has a thermos bottle, not to mention food and clothing. Young girls, when they encounter any festivals, or when international friends come to visit us, they all put on floral clothes. At night, the light of flashlights flashes everywhere, like a lantern festival. Yin Licheng is a military dependent and also the leader of a mutual aid team. He got married last year and had a child this year. Now the child is only more than a month old and is growing up white and fat. Last year's grain has not been eaten, and this year's has been harvested again. Before it got cold, new cloth was bought back, and his parents' cotton clothes had already been sewn! Comrades, look at how our farmers are living!

As life gets better, our children are also happy. The People's Government has set up a primary school in the township, which now has seven classes and more than 260 students. Almost all school-age children go to primary school. Some have already graduated and gone to middle schools in Beijing. These children all know their Volunteer Army uncles. Last year, on National Day, the children wrote many letters to you, wanting to be friends with you. The first reply was written by Comrade Zhang Yihui from your place. He had been to Fengtai and wanted a photo of Fengtai Railway Station. However, the school is far from Fengtai, and taking photos is inconvenient, which made them very embarrassed. Finally, the children discussed it and sent a few of their own single photos. They said: Uncle will also be very happy to see us! From then on, they never stopped writing letters to you. Wang Shuju, a first-grade student, is only seven years old this year. Once, after listening to the heroic story of Zhang Weilang, she secretly ran out to buy stationery and insisted that the class teacher write a letter to you for her. The class teacher asked her to wait a while, but she didn't agree. This ignorant child has her Volunteer Army uncles in her heart!

Adults are busy with production during the day, and go to night school to study in the evening. Xu Baochun, a youth league member and night school teacher, produces during the day and teaches at night. He works very hard. A few days ago, he gave the students a few nouns and asked them to make sentences, including the word "hero." Can you guess what the students wrote? They all wrote: "Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army has many heroes in Korea..." Although the sentences written by everyone are a bit different, they all thought of you!

Dear Comrades, the fresh things in our township are endless, even if we talk about them for a day. In a few days, Comrade Yin Weichen will be able to meet you in person. At that time, you can ask him whatever you want, and he will tell you. Before leaving, he also said that he would remember all your fresh things and come back to tell us!

### 咱乡的殷维臣同志去看你们了

    咱乡的殷维臣同志去看你们了
    中国共产党北京市丰台区  黄土岗乡支部书记  安培森
    亲爱的志愿军同志们：
    国庆节那天，我们又在天安门前，看到了咱们的毛主席，看到了你们派回来的代表。毛主席还是那么健康，你们的代表还是那么有精神。同志们，就是毛主席领导的好，就是你们的仗打得好，咱们的生产才搞得好，日子才过得好。
    前些天，全国人民组织的第三届赴朝慰问团，已经出发了。咱乡里的殷维臣同志，也参加了慰问团，到朝鲜去看你们了。他临走时，大家那个欢送劲儿，真是三天两夜也说不完！
    说起来殷维臣，话就长了。他是共产党员，也是咱乡里农业生产合作社的社长。合作社的成立，可真不容易。就说副社长田长和吧，土地改革时就入了党，还当过村长。可是日子一好过，他就转了向。家里雇了两个半长工，自己连地也懒得种了，每天吃吃喝喝，工作也很少过问。区委会知道了这件事，就派人来帮助他批判思想；前年他又参加了整党训练班，思想才慢慢豁亮起来。后来他就和殷维臣筹划组织生产合作社。可是，他妈又不同意，再加上别的人也有点自私，殷维臣自己就松了劲。上级知道了，又派人来帮助，党员先开了检讨会，合计了一下办法，成立了个领导核心，合作社才慢慢地抬起头来。社里共有八户人家，种着一百一十七亩土地，光水浇地就有四十六亩。人一多，劳动力调配着就方便了；钱多，手头也就宽裕了；地多，想种啥就种啥。再加上新的耕作技术，上粪多、雨水好，庄稼长得真是一块赛一块的！头一年，小麦、玉米、白菜、土豆等，都是全乡最高的产量。白菜丰产地，一亩就收了一万八千多斤，土豆每亩也收了五千多斤。这种产量，在全北京也数着头一份！再加上副业，全年的收入就折合玉米八百九十多石，每人可净收入一千四百三十斤，比过去的收入增加了百分之六十四还要多！
    这一来，没入社的农民们可起了眼，要求入社的人越来越多。今年春上，社内就有社员三十四户，土地三百三十四亩，十二头牲口，八辆大车，农具也很全。社员里边有八个党员，一个团员。说劳动，都是一个顶一个的。天一擦亮，合作社的大钟就响了起来，社员从四面八方跑到合作社，拿起家伙就走。张雨林是个队长，快五十岁了，他还带头劳动。平常每天总是做十分，今年春天平菜畦时，一天就做了十三分！白天干一天活，晚间还得给大家算分，又要合计第二天各人的工作，老是到晚十一点才能睡觉。八月份社内评奖时，他还得了一条毛巾、一块肥皂哩！
    男社员是这样，女的也不落后。杜梅英是个十九岁的共产党员，乡妇联主任，场里活、地里活，差不多都能做得来。平常，她总爱和男的挑战，别人要瞧不起她，她眼一瞪，胸脯一挺，就说：“别瞧不起咱们妇女，开飞机、开火车都有咱妇女的份，还说地里活！”今年拔麦时，好多女同志都嚷着要去和男的比赛比赛。有的男同志故意逗她们：“还拔麦哩，不到两垄，管叫你们都垮下来！”可是，马玉英头一天就挣了十一分零五，比有些男同志还高一等。这一下子，可给她们增了不少的光。丁德珍是一个十五岁的小姑娘，她见人就说：“还瞧得起我们妇女不？不信，再来赛赛！”
    殷维臣农业生产合作社，就好像一杆大旗一样，插在咱乡里，别的人都乐意跟着它走。光巩固起来的互助组，就有十个，连合作社算在一块，组织起来的户数，快占全乡的一半了。有个啥先进经验，只要合作社、互助组试验成功，别的就跟着学起来。咱这里是个半菜区，有二百多眼水井，解放后又都换上了水车，三分之一的地都能浇到。天旱时，浇不到的地，就挑水点种。今年的麦子，平均比去年增产了一成多。秋庄稼也很好。“金皇后”玉米长得有一尺多长，粒子顶饱满。白菜更惹人可爱。合作社种的三十多亩白菜，都长得肥头大脑的，又黑又绿，一眼看去，就好像一片绿席一样。要是没啥意外，管保一亩地收它二万斤出头！眼下，大秋虽没全收下来，有些地还叫水泡了几天，可是总起来，还比去年增产一成多。
    要说雨水，解放前可是咱乡的大祸害。雨水一大，一千多亩地都泡在水里，水有截腰深，一泡就是半个多月。玉米一亩地顶多收四十斤，有的房子也叫泡塌了。一九五○年春天，咱这里挖了五里多长的排水沟，今年又拉长了一些，雨水随下就随流走了，最低洼的地，水也只能积存两三天。排水沟每年春上整修一次，分段包工，到时候一叫，大伙就都去了。今年秋收后，还打算把它再挖宽一点，这一来呀，雨再下的大，也不怕它！
    咱这里庄稼收的好，还有一个原由：今年六月间，麦子快熟了，春玉米也塞上了红缨，猛不防，乡里发现了钻心虫，庄稼的叶子上到处爬的都是，一堆呀，就是七八十个。药水洒了也不成。那几天，大伙都到地里捉虫子，爱唱歌的女同志也不唱了，那个紧张劲头儿，真像和你们打美国鬼子一样。魏田贵是咱乡的副乡长，他的三亩多麦子，快叫钻心虫吃光了。眼看虫子要到别人的地里去吃玉米，他发动全家都出动了，把地的圆圈挖了深沟，把虫子都引诱到沟里，三天全消灭光了。他说：“我的完了，别人的可不能也叫给糟蹋了！”
    粮食打得多，咱们的日子也好过了。解放后，光新房子全乡就添了一百多间，差不多每家都有个暖水瓶，吃的、穿的就不用说了。年轻的姑娘，一遇到啥节日，或是国际友人到咱这里来参观时，都换上了花衣服。夜里，手电筒的光到处一闪一闪地，好像过灯节一模样儿。殷立成是个军属，还是一个互助组的组长。他去年才结婚的，今年生了个孩子，现在孩子才一个多月，长得又白又胖。去年的粮食还没吃完，今年就又打下来。天没冷，新布就买回来了，他爸和他妈的棉衣服早就缝好了！同志们，看看，咱农民的日子过得怎么样！
    日子一好过，咱们的孩子也都幸福了。人民政府在乡里办了个小学校，现在已有七个班，二百六十多个学生，差不多的学龄儿童，都到小学校里去念书了。有的已经毕了业，到北京市的中学去念书了。这些孩子，都知道他们的志愿军叔叔。去年国庆节时，孩子们给你们写了很多信，想和你们做朋友。第一封回信，是你们那里的张义慧同志写来的。他到过丰台，想要张丰台车站的照片。可是，学校离丰台远，照像不方便，可把他们难为坏了。最后，孩子们合计了一下，把自己的单身照片寄去了几张。他们说：叔叔看到我们自己，也会很高兴！打这时起，他们给你们写信，就没断过头。一年级的学生王淑菊，今年才七岁，一次她听了张渭良的英勇故事后，就偷偷跑出去买了信纸信封，非叫班主任代她给你们写信不行。班主任叫她稍等一会，她不答应。不懂事的孩子，可是心眼里就有她的志愿军叔叔呀！
    大人白天忙着生产，晚间就到夜校去念书。夜校教员徐宝春是个青年团员，他白天生产，夜晚就去教书，工作很认真。前几天，他给学生出了几个名词，叫他们造句，这里面有“英雄”两个字。你们猜猜看，学生都是写的啥？全都写着：“咱们中国人民志愿军，在朝鲜有好些英雄”……。大伙写的句子虽有点不一样，可全都想到了你们！
    亲爱的同志们，咱乡里的新鲜事儿，再说一天，也没个完。再过几天，殷维臣同志就能和你们亲自见面了，那时候，你们问啥，他就会给你们说啥。临走前，他还说要把你们的新鲜事儿都记起来，回来告诉我们哩！
