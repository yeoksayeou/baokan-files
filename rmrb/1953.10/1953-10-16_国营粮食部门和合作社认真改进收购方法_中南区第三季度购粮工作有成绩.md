State-owned Grain Departments and Cooperatives Seriously Improve Procurement Methods
Central South China Achieves Success in Grain Procurement in the Third Quarter

Currently, Central South China is in the season for large-scale marketing of mid-season and late-season rice. State-owned grain departments and cooperatives in various parts of Central South China are continuing to strengthen grain procurement work. From July 1st to September 15th, the actual amount of rice procured in the region increased by 34.28% compared to the same period last year; Guangdong Province had the largest increase, at 66.12%, exceeding the third-quarter procurement target.

The considerable success in grain procurement in Central South China during the third quarter is largely attributed to the serious improvements made by grain procurement cadres in their methods. Under the leadership of local Party committees and governments, grain procurement cadres in various parts of Central South China have further improved procurement methods based on the widespread adoption of assembly-line operations. For example, the Yichun County Grain Bureau in Jiangxi Province improved the weighing method, enabling one person to monitor two scales, increasing work efficiency by 50%. Grain procurement departments in Nanchang and Shangrao counties created "hand-operated rapid calculators" and "standard sieve skin self-removal methods." After simultaneously promoting assembly-line operations, procurement efficiency doubled or tripled, exceeding the August procurement target. Cadres at the Gao Yao County Grain Bureau in Guangdong Province invented an "automatic converter," merging the weighing and price calculation processes into one step, increasing procurement efficiency by 14.63 times. Farmers are very satisfied with the continuous improvement of working methods at grain procurement stations. They say: In the past, selling grain was a matter of "people waiting for money," but now it's "money waiting for people." In addition, some areas have organized mobile procurement teams or brought goods to the countryside, taking advantage of temple fairs to hold material exchange meetings, supplying farmers with the goods they need after selling grain, which has also encouraged farmers to sell grain.

Close cooperation between state-owned grain departments and cooperatives in carrying out procurement work is also an important reason for the success of grain procurement in Central South China. In the past, grain departments in some areas of Central South China did not clearly recognize the importance of relying on cooperatives to complete procurement tasks, haggling over handling fees, preferential fees, and other issues. Some cooperatives also did not fully understand the task of entrusted grain procurement, believing that entrusted purchase and sale was not as profitable as self-operation. Therefore, there was a phenomenon of mutual buck-passing in work, which caused some losses to the work. This phenomenon is now gradually being corrected. Jiangxi Province has set up 1,500 procurement points (an increase of 50% compared to last year), of which cooperative procurement points account for 80%; Hunan Province has 2,612 procurement points, with cooperative procurement points accounting for about 95%; cooperative procurement points also account for a large proportion in other provinces. In the procurement work at grassroots procurement points, cadres of grain departments and cooperatives can generally cooperate well and help each other improve business. For example, the Fourth and Second District Grain Depots of Fengcheng County in Jiangxi Province often send cadres to help cooperative procurement in the work of purchasing rice, and study and improve work with cooperatives; local cooperatives can often complete procurement tasks, and when transporting rice, they also pack standard packages to reduce losses and save labor costs. The Dianbai County Grain Bureau in Guangdong Province has been able to continuously exceed procurement targets because it can rely on and help cooperatives to carry out procurement work well.

At present, the situation of completing rice procurement tasks in various provinces of Central South China is unbalanced. In the third quarter, in addition to Guangdong Province exceeding the procurement plan, other rice-producing provinces such as Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Guangxi have either nearly completed the plan or completed the plan poorly. Currently, the main problems in rice procurement in Central South China are as follows:

First, some areas have insufficient supply of means of production and means of livelihood, especially fertilizers, which cannot meet the needs of farmers. According to a survey in Yangjiang County, Guangdong Province, the Ninth District of the county needs 21,600 dan of various fertilizers in one quarter. Due to the insufficient supply of fertilizers, farmers are unwilling to sell grain. On the contrary, Shuangshui Town in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, originally only had 70,000 to 80,000 jin of grain on the market every day. After the cooperative vigorously supplied fertilizer, the amount of grain on the market still increased to more than 100,000 jin, even though it rained that day.

Second, the phenomenon of speculative grain merchants intercepting and fraudulently purchasing, or using various methods to purchase state grain for decentralized hoarding and disrupting the grain market, still occurs constantly. This has also affected the smooth progress of grain procurement work.

Third, some grain procurement cadres have blindly optimistic or negative and relaxed thoughts. In Yuezhong District of Guangdong Province and Binhu area of Hunan Province, etc., due to the large amount of grain on the market and the good completion of procurement tasks, many grain procurement cadres have developed blindly optimistic thoughts and want to relax; in some areas with less grain on the market, some cadres have lost confidence in completing tasks, holding a negative attitude of "collecting as much as possible," and do not actively think of ways to complete tasks.

In addition, the price ratio between some local products, special products, and grain is not reasonable, which also affects grain procurement work.

The relevant departments are studying solutions to the above problems.

### 国营粮食部门和合作社认真改进收购方法  中南区第三季度购粮工作有成绩

    国营粮食部门和合作社认真改进收购方法
    中南区第三季度购粮工作有成绩
    目前，中南区正是中稻、晚稻大量上市的季节。中南各地国营粮食部门和合作社正继续加强粮食收购工作。全区自七月一日到九月十五日止，收购大米的实绩较去年同期增加了百分之三十四点二八；其中以广东增加最多，为百分之六十六点一二，超额完成了第三季度的收购任务。
    中南区第三季度收购粮食工作所以有相当成绩，收粮干部认真改进收购方法是个重要因素。中南各地收粮干部在当地党委、政府领导下，在普遍采用流水作业法的基础上，进一步改善了收粮的方法。如江西宜春县粮食局改进了过磅方法，一人能看两台磅秤，工作效率提高百分之五十。南昌及上饶等县购粮部门创造“手摇速算器”、“标准箩皮自除法”，同时推行流水作业法以后，购粮效率提高了一倍到两倍。超额完成了八月份的收购任务。广东省高要县粮食局干部创造了“自动换算器”，将过磅和计算价款两项工作合并为一道工序，使收购效率提高了十四点六三倍。农民对购粮站不断改进工作方法都很满意。他们说：过去卖粮是“人等钱”，现在是“钱等人”。另外，有些地区组织了流动收购组，或带货下乡，趁庙会召开物资交流会，供应农民售粮后需要的用品，这也鼓舞了农民的售粮情绪。
    中南各地国营粮食部门和合作社密切配合，进行收购工作，也是中南区收购粮食工作获得成绩的一个重要原因。过去中南区有些地区的粮食部门对依靠合作社完成收购任务的重要性认识不明确，斤斤计较手续费、优待费等问题；有的合作社对国家委托代购粮食的任务也认识不足，以为代购代销不如自营有利。因此，双方在工作中有互相推诿的现象，使工作受到一定损失。目前这种现象已逐渐纠正。江西全省设置了一千五百个收购点（比去年增加了百分之五十），其中合作社收购点就占百分之八十；湖南全省设有二千六百一十二个收购点，合作社的收购点占百分之九十五左右；其他各省合作社的收购点也占很大比重。在基层收购点的收购工作中，粮食部门和合作社的干部大都能很好配合，互相帮助改进业务。如江西省丰城县四区、二区粮库在收购稻谷工作中经常派干部帮助合作社收购，并和合作社研究改进工作；当地合作社能经常完成收购任务，并且在调运稻谷时，还打好标准包，以减少损耗，节省力资。广东省电白县粮食局因为能很好依靠和帮助合作社进行收购工作，所以能不断地超额完成收购任务。
    目前，中南各省完成收购稻谷任务的情况是不平衡的。第三季度除广东省超额完成收购计划外，其他江西、湖南、湖北、广西各产稻省份，有的是接近完成计划，有的完成计划的情况很差。目前，中南区收购稻谷工作中，主要存在以下几个问题：
    第一、有些地区生产资料和生活资料供应不足，特别是肥料的供应更满足不了农民的需要。据广东省阳江县的调查，该县九区一个季度就需要各种肥料二万一千六百担，由于肥料供应不足，农民便不愿意卖粮。相反的，广东省新会县双水镇原来每天只上市粮食七、八万斤，合作社大力供应肥料后，当天虽然下雨，粮食上市量仍增加到十多万斤。
    第二、投机粮商拦路抢购、骗购，或利用各种办法套购国家粮食进行分散囤积，扰乱粮食市场的现象，仍不断发生。这也影响了购粮工作的顺利开展。
    第三、某些地区收粮干部存在着盲目乐观或消极、松气的思想。广东省粤中区及湖南省滨湖地区等，因粮食上市量大，收购任务完成较好，许多收粮干部产生了盲目乐观、想松一口气的思想；在一些粮食上市量少的地区，有些干部对完成任务失去信心，抱着“能收多少算多少”的消极态度，不积极想办法完成任务。
    另外，有些土产、特产和粮食的比价不够合理，也影响了粮食收购工作。
    以上问题，各有关部门正在研究解决中。
