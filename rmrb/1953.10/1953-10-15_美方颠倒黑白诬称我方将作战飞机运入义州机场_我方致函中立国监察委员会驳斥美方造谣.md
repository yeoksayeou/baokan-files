Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 13th: The U.S. side groundlessly accused the Korean-Chinese side on the 12th of boxing and transporting reinforcing warplanes into Yiju Airport and requested the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to send a mobile neutral nations inspection team to conduct an investigation.

    Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, the chief representative of the Korean-Chinese side to the Military Armistice Commission, wrote to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission that same day, pointing out that the U.S. accusation was groundless. The Neutral Nations Inspection Team sent to Sinuiju Port in the Korean-Chinese area arrived there as early as August 13th and began supervising and inspecting the replacement of war materials on August 19th. So far, it has not reported any violations of the armistice agreement. Even the new Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, Hull, admitted when answering reporters' questions about the U.S. accusation in Munsan on the 12th: "I am not aware of any serious violations of the armistice agreement at present."

    In fact, it is the U.S. side itself that has violated the armistice agreement by boxing and transporting reinforcing war materials in the name of parts. At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on October 3rd, the U.S. chief representative, Bryan, claimed that Article 13, Paragraph 2 of the Armistice Agreement regarding the cessation of the entry of reinforcing war materials from outside Korea "does not mention parts" and insisted that parts for warplanes, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition are not subject to the above provisions. At the staff meeting where the two sides discussed the issue of parts, the U.S. side still insisted on this unreasonable claim. The U.S. side's insistence on this violation of the armistice agreement is obviously aimed at disassembling warplanes, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition into parts and transporting them into South Korea, and then assembling them into complete warplanes, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition in South Korea. According to reports from the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed at various ports in South Korea to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, it has been discovered many times that the U.S. side has not complied with the provisions of Article 13, Paragraph 2 of the Armistice Agreement, and the military materials it has transported into South Korea do not match what it has reported to the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams. At the same time, at ports such as Busan and Incheon, U.S. personnel managing military materials have repeatedly refused the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams to inspect the war materials being boxed and transported into South Korea and the ships transporting war materials.

    People here point out that the U.S. side's malicious accusation against the Korean-Chinese side is not only to cover up its criminal act of disassembling war materials into parts and boxing them for transportation into South Korea but also to attempt to divert world attention and evade its responsibility for seriously violating the armistice agreement and the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and delaying and undermining the explanation work.

    美方颠倒黑白诬称我方将作战飞机运入义州机场
    我方致函中立国监察委员会驳斥美方造谣
    【新华社开城十三日电】美方在十二日毫无根据地指控朝中方面装箱运入增援性的作战飞机到义州机场，并要求中立国监察委员会派遣机动中立国视察小组前往进行调查。
    军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将已在当天写信给中立国监察委员会，指出美方的指控是毫无根据的。派赴朝中方面地区新义州口岸的中立国视察小组，早在八月十三日就到达该地，并在八月十九日开始对作战物资的替换进行监督与视察，至今并未报告有任何违反停战协定事件发生。就是新任的联合国军总司令赫尔十二日在汶山答复记者对美方这一指控的询问时也承认：“我不知道在目前有任何严重的违反停战协定的行动”。
    事实上，违反停战协定，以零件为名装箱运入增援性的作战物资的正是美方自己。在十月三日军事停战委员会会议上，美方首席委员勃里安声称：停战协定第十三款卯项关于停止从朝鲜境外进入增援的作战物资的规定中，“并未提及零件”，并且主张作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药的零件不受上述规定的限制。在双方讨论零件问题的参谋人员会议上，美方也仍然坚持这一无理主张。美方坚持这种违反停战协定的主张，目的显然在于把作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药拆成零件运入南朝鲜，然后在南朝鲜装配成为完整的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药。根据驻南朝鲜各口岸的中立国视察小组向中立国监察委员会的报告，已多次发现美方没有遵守停战协定第十三款卯项的规定，其所运入南朝鲜的军事物资与它向中立国视察小组所报告者不符。同时，在釜山和仁川等口岸，美方管理军事物资的人员，一再拒绝中立国视察小组视察装箱运入南朝鲜的作战物资，和运入作战物资的船只。
    此间人士指出：美方对朝中方面的这种恶意指控，不仅在于掩饰它把作战物资拆成零件装箱运入南朝鲜的罪恶行为，而且在企图借此转移世界的注意力，逃避它严重违反停战协定和“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，拖延和破坏解释工作的责任。
