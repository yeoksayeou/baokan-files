Anshan Iron and Steel Works (Anshan Steel), in order to meet the needs of planned, large-scale economic construction, has adopted the method of "self-reliance and using local resources" to cultivate and train technical personnel.

Over the past year, Anshan Steel has added a spare-time industrial university and two spare-time middle schools, and expanded a technical school and eight spare-time middle schools. It has also opened 180 on-the-job, semi-on-the-job, and spare-time training classes within the factory, with a total of 37,724 participants. According to the nature of their work, they are studying theoretical knowledge in metallurgy, machinery, rolling steel, electrical engineering, mining, chemical engineering, civil engineering, and other subjects. In production, more than 1,830 apprenticeship contracts have been signed. After a period of training, from October 1952 to the present, a total of 7,441 technical personnel and skilled workers have graduated and completed their apprenticeships, an increase of 44 percent over last year, with the number of female workers also increasing by nearly one-half. Their technical level has generally improved by one to two grades compared to their original technical level. These trainees have played a significant role in production. For example, among the 30 trainees who returned to the open-hearth furnace workshop of the steelmaking plant after being trained at the technical school, nine were promoted to furnace chiefs, and the others were promoted to first or second assistants. The most prominent example is Pit No. 1 of the coking workshop, which had poor production performance in the past. Later, five trainees who graduated from the technical school were assigned to work in the pit, and it was rated as a model pit in June.

The Anshan Steel Education Department has also planned to train more than 1,000 outstanding workers in various factories and mines, preparing them to be promoted to technicians after examination. Most of these workers are model workers, new record creators, rationalization proposers, and outstanding veteran skilled workers. Although they are now studying intensively, most of them are already operating with the class, replacing the work of technicians and assistants. For example, in the sintering section of the ore dressing plant, two of the three university-trained duty technicians were transferred due to work needs, and their work was replaced by Guo Shiji and Yang Shuncheng, worker-technicians who were cultivated.

In the past year, Anshan Steel has cultivated a large number of technical cadres and skilled workers through various forms, which has played a huge role in ensuring the completion and early completion of the national plan.

    鞍钢培养和训练技术力量收效很大
    为了适应有计划的大规模经济建设的需要，鞍钢教育处采用了“自力更生，就地取材”的办法来培养和训练技术力量。
    一年来，鞍钢增设了一个业余工业大学和两个业余中学，并扩大了一个技工学校、八个业余中学，在厂内又开办了一百八十个脱离生产、半脱离生产和业余训练班，参加学习的共有三万七千七百二十四人。根据工种的性质分别学习冶金、机械、轧钢、电机、采矿、化工、土建等科理论知识。在生产当中又签订了一千八百三十多份师徒合同。经过了一个时期的培养，从一九五二年十月起到目前为止，先后出徒和结业的技术人员和技术工人共有七千四百四十一名，较去年增加了百分之四十四，女工也增加了约近二分之一。他们的技术水平，普遍在原有的技术水平上提高了一级到两级。这些学员在生产当中起了很大的作用，如经过技工学校培养后回到炼钢平炉车间的三十名学员中，就有九名被提升为炉长，其他也都提升为一助手或二助手。最突出的是造块车间一号坑，该坑在过去生产情况是比较差的，后来由技工学校结业的五名学员被分配到该坑工作，六月份就被评为模范坑。
    鞍钢教育处在各厂矿还有计划地培养了一千余名优秀工人，准备经过考试后提升为技术员。这些工人大半是劳动模范、新纪录创造者、合理化建议人和优秀的老技术工人等。他们现在虽然正在紧张地学习中，但是，大部分人员已随班操作，代替技术人员和助手的工作。如选矿厂烧结工段，三名大学出身的值班技术员中因工作需要调走了两名，就由培养出来的工人技术员郭实基和杨顺成代替了值班技术员的工作。
    一年来，鞍钢通过各种形式，培养了大批的技术干部和技术工人，对保证完成和提前完成国家计划起了巨大的作用。
