Answer to Readers' Questions

    Editor's Note: The article "A Suggestion Regarding the Publication of the 1953 Calendar" published on the second page of this newspaper on August 20th last year pointed out that the sixth month of the lunar calendar is big and the seventh month is small this year, and it was hoped that calendar publishing units in various regions would pay attention. Currently, some readers are still inquiring about this issue. We are now publishing a summary of the reply from the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Nanjing.

    In the past, general calendars were based on the "Wan Nian Li" (Ten Thousand Year Calendar). The "Wan Nian Li" was calculated by the Qing Dynasty's Imperial Astronomical Observatory based on the "Lixiang Kao Cheng" (Compendium of Observational Astronomy) compiled during the Kangxi and Qianlong periods. The "Lixiang Kao Cheng" had certain value at the time. However, because the understanding of the laws of motion of the sun, moon, and planets was not clear enough at that time, and the Copernican heliocentric theory had not been formally introduced to China, the precision of the "Lixiang Kao Cheng" was not sufficient.

    The lunar month calculations for this year's sixth and seventh months issued by our observatory differ from those recorded in the "Wan Nian Li". On the one hand, this is because the "Wan Nian Li" is inaccurate. On the other hand, it is due to the different times used for calculation. The "Wan Nian Li" calculates according to Beijing local time (the time at 116 degrees 28 minutes east longitude), while our calculations use standard time at 120 degrees east longitude (commonly known as Beijing time). For every 15 degrees of longitude difference, the time differs by one hour. The 120 degrees east longitude standard time is 14 minutes ahead of Beijing local time (for example, when the 120 degrees east longitude standard time is 12:00, the Beijing local time is 11:46). This year, the time of conjunction for the seventh lunar month, calculated by the new method, is 16:10 on August 9th (Greenwich time). Converting this to the 120 degrees east longitude standard time, we should add eight hours, which makes it 0:10 on August 10th. Therefore, the first day of the seventh lunar month should be on August 10th of the Gregorian calendar, and the sixth month should be big and the seventh month small. If calculated using "Beijing local time," the first day of the seventh lunar month would be at 23:56 on August 9th of the Gregorian calendar, which would make the sixth month small and the seventh month big. Now the whole world adopts the standard time system, and it is inappropriate to use local time.

    The timing of solar terms recorded in the "Wan Nian Li" often differs by more than one hour from the timing calculated by our observatory. For example, the "Wan Nian Li" records the "Great Snow" solar term in 1954 as being at the first quarter of the Zi hour on the 14th day of the eleventh lunar month, which is 0:28 on December 8th of the Gregorian calendar (Beijing local time). The "Abstract of the 1954 Calendar" published by our observatory states that the "Great Snow" solar term is at 23:29 on December 7th. Because the time of the "Great Snow" solar term is close to midnight, although the time difference is only tens of minutes, the date differs by one day. This is a point that should be noted when compiling and printing next year's calendar.

### 为什么今年阴历六月大、七月小？

专栏：答读者问

    为什么今年阴历六月大、七月小？
    编者按：去年八月二十日本报二版所刊“关于出版一九五三年历书的一个建议”一文中曾指出：今年阴历六月大、七月小，希望各地历书编印单位注意。目前仍有一些读者询问这个问题，现在将南京中国科学院紫金山天文台的答复摘要发表于后。
    过去一般历书都是根据“万年历”编的。“万年历”是满清钦天监根据康熙及乾隆年间所编的“历象考成”推算的。“历象考成”在当时有一定的价值。但由于那时对日月行星运动规律认识还不够清楚，哥白尼地动学说还没有正式介绍到中国来。因此，“历象考成”的精密程度是很不够的。
    我台所发表今年阴历六、七月的月建与“万年历”所载不同，一方面固然是因为“万年历”不准确；另一方面是由于计算所用时间的不同。“万年历”推算是北京地方时间（是东经一百十六度二十八分的时刻），而我们的计算是用东经一百二十度的标准时（通称为北京时间）。经度每差十五度，时间就差一小时。东经一百二十度标准时比北京地方时多十四分钟（例如：东经一百二十度标准时为十二时的时候，北京地方时是十一时四十六分）。今年阴历七月合朔时刻，按新法计算是公历八月九日时间（即格林威治时间）十六时十分，化为东经一百二十度标准时间应加八小时，即八月十日零时十分。所以，阴历七月朔应在公历八月十日，应该六月大、七月小。若用“北京地方时”计算，则阴历七月朔在公历八月九日二十三时五十六分，那末，就变成六月小、七月大了。现在全世界都采用标准时的制度，用地方时是不合适的。
    “万年历”所载节气时刻与我台所计算的时刻常可相差到一小时以上。如“万年历”载一九五四年“大雪”节在阴历十一月十四日子正一刻十三分、公历十二月八日零时二十八分、（北京地方时），我台所发表的“一九五四年日历摘要”“大雪”节在十二月七日二十三时二十九分。因“大雪”节的时刻接近夜半，二者时间虽只相差数十分，而日期则相差一天。这是编印明年日历时应该注意的一点。
