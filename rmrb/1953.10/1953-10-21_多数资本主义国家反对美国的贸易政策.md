Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 20th: The United States' self-serving trade policy has been unanimously opposed by other participating countries at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) conference. Thirty-two of the thirty-three participating countries passed a resolution demanding that the United States cease implementing import restriction measures.

The eighth session of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) convened in Geneva on September 17th. From the second day of the conference onwards, led by Britain, representatives from many countries criticized the United States' foreign trade policy of demanding that other countries open their markets while building high tariff barriers for itself. Subsequently, throughout the conference, other participating countries continued to level accusations against the U.S. trade policy, particularly Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Denmark, and other dairy product exporting countries, who launched especially fierce attacks on the United States for recently announcing new measures to tighten restrictions on dairy product imports.

Opposition to the U.S. trade policy at the conference reached its peak on October 13th. With the exception of the United States, the thirty-two countries participating in the agreement unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the United States "pay attention" to the "harmful effects on international trade relations" caused by its restrictive measures and cease implementing import restriction measures. Reuters reported that during the discussion of this motion, "representatives from many countries severely criticized the United States' import restriction policy."

Because the United States has continued to implement new restrictive measures despite the protests of other countries, the aforementioned resolution passed at the conference also authorized the Dutch government to take "retaliatory measures" against the United States, reducing imports of U.S. wheat by 12,000 to 15,000 tons in 1954.

According to Xinhua News Agency: Britain is working to revise the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in order to strengthen the British Imperial Preference system, protect the British Empire market, and resist competition from other capitalist countries.

At the eighth session of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which began on September 17th in Geneva, the head of the British delegation and British Trade Minister, Thorneycroft, requested the freedom to increase import tariffs on certain agricultural products from non-Commonwealth countries. However, this request was opposed by representatives from other countries, led by the United States, France, Italy, and the Netherlands, and as a result, the request was handed over to a working group for "study."

Britain is very dissatisfied with this. The British Conservative Party's annual conference held in Margate this month unanimously passed a resolution on the 9th, demanding that the British government take steps to amend the current General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade so that Britain has the right to expand the Imperial Preference system and freely set differential tariffs to protect the domestic market from adverse foreign competition. According to Reuters: Many delegates spoke at the meeting in support of this request. Lord Balfour, a delegate, advocated amending the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to restore Britain's freedom on tariffs and facilitate multilateral trade. He said that without this freedom, Britain's traditional markets would collapse.

Most Commonwealth countries support Britain's request. According to the "Melbourne Herald," citing a "senior figure," Australia is also asking for a relaxation of the current restrictions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and if its efforts fail, Australia will consider withdrawing from the agreement.

    多数资本主义国家反对美国的贸易政策
    【新华社二十日讯】日内瓦消息：在国际关税与贸易总协定会议上，美国损人利己的贸易政策遭到其他与会国家的一致反对。三十三个与会国中的三十二国通过决议，要求美国停止施行入口限制措施。
    国际关税与贸易总协定第八届会议九月十七日在日内瓦召开。从会议开幕的第二天起，在英国带头之下，许多国家的代表纷纷抨击美国一味要别国开放市场自己却高筑关税壁垒的对外贸易政策。以后，在会议的进行中间，不断有其他与会国家对于美国的贸易政策提出指责，特别是澳大利亚、新西兰、荷兰、丹麦等奶制品输出国家，对于美国直到最近还宣布新的措施，加紧限制奶制品入口，攻击尤为激烈。
    会议上对美国贸易政策的反对情绪到十月十三日发展到了高潮。除美国外，参加这个协定的三十二个国家一致通过了一项决议，要求美国“注意”它的限制措施“对国际贸易关系造成的有害影响”，停止施行入口限制的措施。路透社报道说：会议在讨论这项议案时，“许多国家的代表都严厉地抨击了美国的进口限制政策”。
    由于美国一直不顾其他国家的抗议而继续施行新的限制措施，会议上通过的上述决议还授权荷兰政府对美国采取“报复措施”，把一九五四年输入的美国小麦削减一万二千至一万五千吨。
    据新华社讯：英国正策动修改国际关税与贸易总协定，以便加强英帝国优惠制，保护英帝国市场，抵抗其他资本主义国家的竞争。
    在自九月十七日起举行的日内瓦国际关税与贸易总协定第八届会议上，英国代表团团长、英国贸易大臣桑尼克罗夫特曾要求给予增加非联邦国家若干农产品入口关税的自由。但是这个要求，受到以美国为首的法国、意大利、荷兰等其他国家代表的反对，结果这项要求被交给了一个工作组“研究”。
    英国对此非常不满。本月在马尔加特举行的英国保守党年会九日一致通过一项决议，要求英国政府采取步骤，修改现行的国际关税与贸易总协定，以便使英国有权扩大帝国优惠制，自由订定有区别的关税来保护国内市场，使之免受外国的不利竞争。据路透社报道：许多代表都在会上发言，支持这个要求。代表鲍尔弗勋爵赞成修改国际关税与贸易总协定，恢复英国在关税上的自由，便利多边贸易。他说，如果没有这种自由，英国的传统市场就要瓦解。
    大多数英联邦国家都支持英国的要求。据“墨尔本先驱报”引一个“高级人士”的消息说，澳大利亚也要求放宽目前的关税与贸易总协定的限制，如果它的这一努力失败，澳大利亚将考虑退出这个协定。
