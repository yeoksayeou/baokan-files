    Actively Seek Tasks and Adapt to the Needs of National Construction
    Gan Bai, Deputy Director of the Third Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry
    Recently, we inspected the production situation of several factories under our bureau and found a relatively common abnormal phenomenon in planning and business management. That is, although some factories have completed or overfulfilled the state plan, the utilization rate of the factory's equipment is very low, only between 61.51% and 65.57%. A large number of workers are idle. In some factories, hundreds of workers are idle and have to be organized into cleaning and sanitation teams to tidy up the factory environment. Some factories have a large backlog of products in their warehouses that cannot be sold. Some factories are worried about not having suitable tasks, while many equipment and spare parts needed for national construction cannot find factories to undertake them.
    There are many reasons for this disconnect between production and needs. For example, the equipment and technical conditions of most of our factories are currently very poor, and the design and production capacity are far from meeting the needs. Many heavy, precision, and complex machines or parts still cannot be produced and require new factories to be built or temporary orders from abroad to solve. However, there are also many products that our factories are fully capable of manufacturing. It is only because some enterprise leaders have the following incorrect ideas and have shortcomings in their work that they refuse to accept these orders, forcing the ordering departments to order from abroad.
    Some leaders of our enterprises, regardless of objective needs, overemphasize product specialization, hoping to specialize in tasks that conform to the factory's professional nature and can be produced in large quantities or batches, to facilitate the organization and management of the factory. They are unwilling to accept non-specialized products that are desperately needed by the state, resulting in a disconnect between production and sales. For example, the Dalian Crane Machinery Factory originally undertook many piecemeal tasks at the beginning of this year, but after the factory's basic construction plan task book was approved, it was unwilling to accept these piecemeal tasks (such as equipment orders from the Songha Sugar Factory). Other factories have similar situations. Product specialization has many advantages and is the direction we will strive to achieve in the future. However, if we overemphasize specialization at present, it is very inconsistent with China's actual situation because China's needs for equipment (including equipment for new construction and reconstruction of factories) are extremely complex, and the specifications are not uniform. The number of manufacturing and repair factories is small, and new large-scale factories have not yet been built. These characteristics determine that many of our machine factories cannot be completely specialized at present and must adapt to the requirements of various aspects of the country and undertake some piecemeal tasks. If we overemphasize specialization, it will inevitably cause adverse consequences: on the one hand, specialized products will exceed the needs of the country and become backlogged; on the other hand, a large number of piecemeal odd jobs will be ordered from fraternal countries because no one undertakes them. This is obviously extremely unreasonable.
    Some factory leaders are ideologically conservative or afraid of trouble, hoping that the state production plan given by the bureau will be lower, in an attempt to easily complete or overfulfill the state plan. They are only satisfied with the completion of the total output value and total commodity value plans, and do not pay much attention to the utilization of enterprise equipment, the improvement of labor productivity, the excavation of enterprise potential, and the combination of production and sales. Under the dominance of this kind of thinking, cadres at all levels will take a negative attitude towards temporary and piecemeal tasks, emphasizing various difficulties (although they can be overcome), looking for excuses, and refusing orders. For example, a factory director told the relevant section chief:
    "Why doesn't the bureau take care of us and give us so many piecemeal tasks?" "No one is allowed to take on miscellaneous jobs. If anyone takes on miscellaneous jobs and can't complete them, they will be responsible." "Push out what you can, and just forget about what you really can't get out of." "It is possible to take on miscellaneous jobs, but there must be conditions." What are the conditions? First, it is not easy to produce defective products and is easy to do; second, there are ready-made materials; third, the value is high; and fourth, the deadline is long and the quantity is large. Such "good things" are of course not many, so they would rather let workers and equipment be idle. The Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory once treated the Central Light Industry Department Rubber Bureau's vulcanization tank and the Anshan Iron and Steel's electric rake winch orders with such an attitude.
    Some comrades believe that too many product types will hinder plan management. In order to strengthen plan management, we should not accept more temporary orders. This is also wrong. It should be admitted that complex varieties and many temporary tasks will increase the difficulty of implementing job plans. However, the experience of several factories in implementing job plans shows that enterprises producing in batches, small batches, or individually can all compile and implement job plans. The key to the problem lies in organizational leadership and in creating conditions to make various temporary tasks planned, so that they are "miscellaneous but not chaotic." This is the main purpose of strengthening our plan management and is also a sign of good or bad enterprise management. We should learn this skill in order to truly improve our management level.
    Some comrades lead enterprises with a bureaucratic attitude, are ignorant, and dare not accept orders. For example, when the comrades of the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory started construction, they did not find out the production capacity of the factory. When the Central Ministry of Water Resources wanted to order 3,000 mine cars, they thought their capacity was not good and refused to order. However, later facts proved that the factory could not only make this kind of mine car but also make many more. The Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory often loses control of production due to lack of plan management, resulting in repeated fines for late delivery, so it is afraid of fines when it encounters orders and dare not accept them. To overcome this situation, we must strengthen plan management, especially improve job plans first, so that leading cadres can be aware of which equipment and workers have surplus capacity, how many tasks need to be increased, and which products are suitable for the factory's production conditions, so as to give play to the enterprise's potential and create more wealth for the country.
    Some of our comrades believe that major products must be completed, and "extra-plan" temporary tasks may not be completed. When our management agencies inspect the completion of enterprise plans, they often only pay attention to the completion figures of major products, and do not pay enough attention to the completion of temporary orders, which promotes the idea of comrades within the enterprise to neglect temporary order tasks. The major products stipulated by the state must be completed. However, we should also know that many temporary orders or piecemeal tasks are often the most urgent and important tasks, and their importance even exceeds the major product tasks. For example, the Anshan Iron and Steel order of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory is much more important than the mass-produced air compressors. Therefore, we require enterprise leaders to attach the same importance to temporary tasks as to major products, and should pay even more attention to particularly important temporary tasks.
    The Central Committee calls for increasing production and practicing economy, requiring every factory, mine, and transportation enterprise to mobilize and organize the masses, tap potential, find tricks, promote advanced experience, and propose effective measures and methods to complete or overfulfill the state plan. At the same time, we must actively improve the enterprise's business management work, strengthen plan management, implement job plans, and establish and improve the responsibility system to increase production, overfulfill the production plan, and turn in profits. In the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions, we should examine and criticize the various incorrect ideas that existed in business management in the past, grasp the correct direction of the Central Committee, and promote the healthy development of the production increase and economy practice campaign.
    We should not mistakenly think that opposing overemphasizing specialization and advocating taking on more odd jobs as needed means abolishing the plan and the direction of specialization and specializing in odd jobs. In fact, we are moving towards specialization in a step-by-step manner. Most factories have initially defined the direction of specialization due to the start of the national planned economic construction, and more factories will be built in the future to gradually realize specialization. Specialization is the direction of the development of China's machine industry, but we should proceed from reality at present, and under the relatively possible specialization, require some machine factories to actively adapt to the requirements of national construction and take on more odd jobs. Only in this way can it be conducive to the construction of new factories, can fraternal countries better assist our country, meet the needs of our country's construction, and promote the early arrival of China's industrialization. Adapting to the requirements of taking on more odd jobs is a very glorious and arduous task for China's machine factories. This task urgently requires us to step up our learning, strengthen plan management, and improve our ability to manage enterprises. To complete this task, we should do the following:
    1. Criticize the above-mentioned various erroneous views existing in plan management and business management among employees, and advocate and encourage actively taking on tasks under appropriate specialization, fully exploring potential capabilities, and making the greatest efforts to meet the needs of the country and create more wealth for the country.
    2. We should proactively and as early as possible understand and collect the needs of various departments so as to compile production plans according to needs as soon as possible. At the same time, it is recommended that various requesting departments should also put forward their required orders in a planned manner as early as possible, and strive to put forward extra-plan tasks by season so as to make piecemeal tasks planned. This can reduce or avoid passive busyness in production, as well as phenomena such as untimely supply, and promote the improvement of plan management.
    3. Implement job plans to strengthen plan management. Most of the factories under our bureau produce products with complex varieties and specifications, and produce them individually or in small batches. How to compile and implement job plans in this type of factory should pay attention to summarizing experience and improving it.
    4. Strengthen product design work. Product design work will be a major weak link in our machine factories for a considerable period of time in the future. Due to insufficient design force in each factory of our bureau, on the one hand, many products that can be produced domestically have to be ordered from abroad, and on the other hand, the tasks of each factory have not been fully scheduled. Therefore, we should quickly increase and improve the existing product design force, and vigorously collect and sort out the existing product drawings, organize the design force of the bureau and the factory, appropriately divide the work, improve design efficiency, and request the ordering departments to give more assistance.
    5. Increase new varieties in a planned manner and gradually and appropriately stipulate various product specifications. This requires each factory to strengthen the trial manufacture of new products.
    6. Closely coordinate production between factories. At present, there are unbalanced phenomena in labor, equipment, and materials in the production of each factory under our bureau. If organized, many problems will be solved. In order to strengthen cooperation, we should first establish the idea of communist mutual assistance and cooperation among enterprise leading cadres, stipulate necessary systems, vigorously organize production cooperation, and actively obtain the assistance of the local party committee, the Financial and Economic Committee, and the department's office.
    7. Strengthen sales work. The bureau and the factory should strengthen the leadership of sales work, organize forces to actively promote products not controlled by the state, and promptly solicit and absorb user opinions to improve product quality and reduce costs.

    积极揽活，适应国家建设需要
    中央第一机械工业部第三机械工业管理局副局长  甘柏
    最近我们检查了我局几个工厂的生产情况，发现在计划与经营管理方面较为普遍地存在着一种不正常的现象，就是有些工厂虽然完成或超额完成了国家计划，但工厂的设备利用率却很低，只在百分之六十一点五一至百分之六十五点五七之间。大量的工人窝工。在一些厂子里，几百工人闲着，不得不被组织为清洁卫生大队去整顿厂容。有些厂的仓库里积存着大批产品，销不出去。有些工厂愁着没有适当任务，而国家建设上需要的很多设备和修配件，却找不到承制的工厂。
    形成这种生产与需要脱节的原因是多方面的。如目前我们大部分工厂的设备和技术等条件很差，设计与生产能力远远不能满足需要。许多重型的、精密的、复杂的机器或零件仍不能生产，需要新建工厂或暂时向国外订货才能解决。但也有很多产品是我们的工厂完全有条件制造的，只由于某些企业领导干部有以下若干不正确的想法，以及在工作中有缺点，拒绝接受这些订货，才逼使订货部门向国外订购。
    我们有些企业的领导干部不顾客观需要，过分强调产品专业化，希望专门承制符合于本厂专业性质而又可以大量或成批生产的活，以利于工厂的组织管理，而不愿接受非专业化的、但却是国家非常需要的产品，造成产销脱节。例如大连起重机器厂，在今年年初本来承担很多零碎任务，但在该厂基本建设计划任务书被批准后，对于这些零碎任务（如松哈糖厂的设备订货）就不愿接受了。其他厂也有类似情况。产品专业化是有很多优越性的，也是我们今后争取实现的方向，可是，如果目前过分强调专业化，则是十分不符合于我国实际情况的，因为我国对设备（包括新建与改建工厂的设备）的需要极为复杂，规格极不统一，而制造与修配工厂数量很少，新的规模大的工厂尚未建设起来，这些特点就注定了我们目前很多机器工厂不可能完全专业化，必须适应国家各方面的要求，担当某些零碎任务。如果我们过分要求专业化，势必造成不良的后果：一方面专业化产品超过国家需要而积压；另一方面，大批的零碎打杂产品因无人承做而向兄弟国家订购。这显然是极不合理的。
    有些厂的领导同志思想保守，或者怕麻烦，希望局里给的国家生产计划低些，企图轻松地完成或超额完成国家计划。他们仅仅满足于生产总值与商品总值计划的完成，对于企业设备的利用，劳动生产率的提高，企业潜在能力的挖掘，以及产销结合情况等等，是不大过问的。在这种思想支配之下，就会产生各级干部对临时的和零碎的任务采取一种消极态度，强调各种困难（虽然是可以克服的），寻找藉口，拒绝订货。如有的厂长告诉有关科长说：
    “为什么局里不照顾我们，要分给我们这样多的零碎任务呢？”“谁都不许乱揽杂活，谁揽杂活，完成不了谁就要负责。”“能推出去的就推出去，实在说不过去的就算了。”“揽杂活是可以的，但必须有条件。”什么条件呢？就是：一、不易出废品而又容易做的；二、有现成的材料的；三、价值高的；四、期限长，数量多的。这样的“好事”当然是不多的，于是他们就宁愿让工人和设备闲着。大连工矿车辆厂就是曾以这样的态度对待中央轻工业部橡胶局硫化罐与鞍钢电耙卷扬机的订货的。
    有些同志认为产品种类多就会妨碍计划管理，为了加强计划管理，就不应多接受临时订货。这也是错误的。应该承认：品种复杂，临时任务多，会给推行作业计划增加困难。但几个工厂推行作业计划的经验说明了，不论是成批的、小批的、或单个的生产的企业都能够编制与贯彻作业计划，问题的关键在于组织领导，在于要我们创造条件，使各种临时任务计划化，做到“杂而不乱”。这就是我们加强计划管理的主要目的，也是企业管理好坏的标志。我们应学会这种本领，才能真正提高管理水平。
    有些同志以官僚主义的态度领导企业，心中无数，不敢接受订货。如沈阳矿山机器厂的同志在建厂开始时，不摸清工厂的生产能力，当中央水利部要订三千台矿车时，以为能力不行，拒绝订货。但后来事实证明了，该厂不仅能够做这种矿车，而且能做很多。大连工矿车辆厂往往因为缺乏计划管理，控制不住生产，以致多次因误期交货而被罚款，所以一遇到订货就害怕罚款，不敢接受。要克服这种情况，就必须加强计划管理，特别首先搞好作业计划，领导干部才能心中有数，预见到那些设备和工人是有余力，需要增加多少任务，知道那些产品适合于本厂的生产条件，才能发挥企业潜力，给国家创造更多的财富。
    我们有些同志认为主要产品必须完成，“计划外”的临时任务可以不完成。我们管理机关检查企业计划完成情况时，也往往只注意主要产品的完成数字，对于临时订货的完成情况则检查不够，助长了企业内的同志们忽视临时订货任务的思想。国家规定的主要产品是必须完成的。但我们也应该知道：有很多临时订货或零碎任务，却往往是最迫切的重要任务，其重要性甚至超过主要产品任务。如沈阳重型机械厂的鞍钢订货比起成批生产的空气压缩机来就重要得多。因此，我们要求企业领导同志把临时任务与主要产品同样给以重视，而对于特殊重要的临时任务更应加以注意。
    中央号召增产节约，要求每一个厂矿和交通运输企业，都应发动和组织群众，挖掘潜力，找窍门，推广先进经验，提出完成或超额完成国家计划的有效措施和办法，同时要积极改善企业的经营管理工作，加强计划管理，推行作业计划，建立和健全责任制度，以达到增加生产，超额完成生产计划与上缴利润的目的。我们应本着中央指示的精神，检查并批判过去在经营管理上存在的各种不正确思想，掌握中央这一正确方向，才能使增产节约竞赛运动健康地发展。
    我们不应把反对过分强调专业化，主张根据需要，多揽零活，错认为是取消了计划和专业化的方向，而专门打零杂了。事实上我们正在有步骤地走上专业化。多数工厂由于全国计划经济建设已经开始，初步规定了专业的方向，并且今后还将要建立更多的工厂，以便于逐步地实现专业化。专业化是我国机械工业发展的方向，但我们目前应从现实出发，在相对的可能达到的专业化之下，要求某些机械工厂主动地适应国家建设的要求，多担当一些打杂的任务。只有如此，才能有利于新厂的建设，才能够有条件使兄弟国家更好地援助我国，满足我国建设的需要，才能够促进我国工业化的早日到来。适应要求多打杂，对我国机器工厂来说是一件十分光荣而又艰苦的任务。这一任务迫切要求我们加紧学习，加强计划管理，提高管理企业的本领。为完成这个任务，我们应作好以下几件工作：
    一、在职工中批判在计划管理与经营管理上存在着的上述各种错误观点，提倡与鼓励在适当的专业化之下，积极揽活，充分发掘潜在能力，以最大的努力满足国家的要求，为国家创造更多的财富。
    二、我们应主动地尽早地了解与搜集各部门的需要情况，以便及早地根据需要，编制生产计划；同时建议各需要部门也应该尽早地有计划地提出自己所需要的订货，争取做到计划外的任务分季提出，使零碎任务计划化。这样就可以减少或避免生产上的被动忙乱，以及供应不及时等现象，并促进计划管理的提高。
    三、推行作业计划以加强计划管理。我局所属的工厂，大都是产品品种规格复杂、单个或小批生产的。在这种性质的工厂中如何编制与贯彻作业计划，应该注意总结经验和加以提高。
    四、加强产品设计工作。产品的设计工作，今后相当长的时期内都会是我们机械工厂的一个主要薄弱环节。我局各厂都由于设计力量不足，一方面使很多可以在国内生产的产品不得不向国外订购，另一方面各厂任务尚未排满。因此，我们应迅速增长与提高现有的产品设计力量，并要大力搜集与整理现有的产品图纸，把局和厂的设计力量组织起来，适当分工，提高设计效率，并请求订货部门多给以援助。
    五、有计划地增加新品种，逐步地适当地规定出各种产品规范。这就要求各厂加强新产品的试造工作。
    六、密切各工厂之间的生产协作。目前我局各厂生产上都存在着劳动力、设备、及材料等不平衡现象，如果组织起来将会解决很多问题。为了加强协作，首先应在企业领导干部中树立共产主义的互助协作的思想，规定必要的制度，大力组织生产协作，同时并主动地取得地方党委、财政经济委员会、及部的办事处的协助。
    七、加强销售工作。局与厂都应该加强对销售工作的领导，组织力量积极推销国家控制外的产品，及时征求与吸取用户意见，以改善产品质量和降低成本。
