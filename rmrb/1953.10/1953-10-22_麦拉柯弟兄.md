    Brother Mylaike
    By our reporter Zhu Bo
    The Kirgiz people who live in the deep mountains of Tekes County mainly rely on animal husbandry to maintain their lives. In the old society, they suffered from the oppression and plunder of the reactionary rulers, and their livestock decreased day by day, and their lives fell into a tragic situation. After liberation, the Kirgiz compatriots started a new life with great hope; but a few people felt uneasy as if a heavy stone was pressed on their hearts. They held a skeptical attitude towards the Party and the people's government's pastoral policies. Mylaike and Musa are such people.

    Mylaike and Musa are brothers. They separated not long after their parents passed away. They each had fifty or sixty livestock.

    After liberation, Brother Mylaike, like others, excitedly welcomed the arrival of the new era. But before long, while others were planning to increase their livestock, Brother Mylaike was hiding in his yurt, worrying. They were concerned about their future lives and the fate of their livestock.

    Mylaike went to the home of the herdsman Yimingjiang, wanting to ask him about his problems. He walked into the yurt and saw that Yimingjiang looked unusual, with a worried look on his face. Yimingjiang's wife and children were also sitting around him with gloomy expressions. Yimingjiang beckoned Mylaike to sit down and asked, "Do you think life will be good?" Mylaike replied, "I can't say, I want to ask you!" Yimingjiang said sadly, "I'm worried that my herds will be confiscated." He lowered his head after he finished speaking.

    Mylaike left Yimingjiang in disappointment because his problem was not resolved. On the way home, he pondered painfully.

    Musa also came back from outside. He frowned and said to Mylaike, "I asked several families, and they are all worried about this matter. Old man Xia'erxi said: I have lived for seventy years and have experienced several dynasties. I have never seen a dynasty that was beneficial to the Kirgiz people." Musa paused and said, "We don't have as many livestock as others, maybe they won't be confiscated!" Mylaike thought after hearing Musa's words: This is possible, aren't those families with fewer livestock afraid of anything? They are still working hard to breed livestock. Then he thought: Although my livestock are not as many as Yimingjiang's, my family has fewer people than Yimingjiang's. If compared like this, my livestock are not considered few! Thinking of this, he became sad again.

    Once, a staff member came from the district. People said that this was the Communist Party's district party secretary, and he was here to help the Kirgiz people arrange their new lives. The herdsmen ran out of their yurts, vying to shake hands with him. However, Mylaike did not squeeze over to shake hands with the district party secretary. From then on, Mylaike's worries became even heavier. As soon as he got home, he lay down, worried, and didn't even want to eat. He kept thinking: This time it's really bad. The district party secretary didn't shake hands and say hello to me, that's obviously a sign of dislike for me!

    In order to try to get rid of this ideological distress, Mylaike and Musa quietly moved from here to the edge of the pasture.

    After they left their old home, the knot in their minds did not disappear. They were also suspicious of every passerby. One day, Musa said to Mylaike, "Our distress is caused by livestock. Wouldn't it be better if we had fewer livestock?" Mylaike said, "But we don't have few livestock!" Musa came up with an idea: "It's easy to reduce the number of livestock. For example, we can kill them and eat them, or sell them at a low price, or give them away as gifts..." Mylaike shook his head: "I'm afraid this method won't work. If someone asks, how will we answer?" Musa thought of another idea. He said that if someone asks why the livestock were killed, say they were bitten by poisonous snakes; if others ask why the livestock were given away, say that they owed others debts in the past, and now people have taken the livestock away. Mylaike finally agreed to this method.

    Musa and his wife, who used to regard livestock as their lives, often got up early and worked late for them; now, they have completely adopted a different attitude towards their livestock: letting the livestock walk around near the yurt, gnawing on those withered weeds; killing a sheep to eat every few days, and lying in the yurt to sleep after eating their fill. Mylaike also often killed livestock to eat or gave livestock away. Once he used a cow to exchange for a piece of cloth for his wife's skirt. The livestock of Brother Mylaike decreased day by day, and the remaining livestock gradually became thin.

    In the spring of 1952, Mylaike met Rehemujiang who was returning from the county town while picking up firewood from the wild. Mylaike thought to himself: This guy has a lot of livestock, how dare he go to the county town? Why is he so happy? He asked Rehemujiang: "Why are you so happy? Could it be that you have good news?" Rehemujiang smiled and jumped off his horse, patting Mylaike on the shoulder and said: "Yes, I have good news. Now, I am a representative of the herdsmen. I just came back from a meeting in Ili, and the commissioner talked to me!" "Representative of the herdsmen" and "Commissioner" were all unfamiliar terms to Mylaike. So he asked Rehemujiang what that meant. Rehemujiang said excitedly: "Representative of the herdsmen, well, that is…, how can I explain it to you clearly? He has to be responsible for educating the herdsmen, asking the herdsmen to protect the livestock and develop animal husbandry, and helping the herdsmen establish a new life. The commissioner is our superior, you can also call him chief." Rehemujiang also took out the notebook given to him by the conference and showed it to Mylaike.

    After hearing Rehemujiang's words, Mylaike had some changes in his thinking. He began to realize that he was wrong. But he was not completely convinced by Rehemujiang's words. He went to Jiaoda's house again and saw that Jiaoda and his wife had bought two stallions from the county town. Jiaoda now has thirty horses, twenty cows, and more than five hundred sheep, and the livestock are all fed fat and strong. Mylaike came out of Jiaoda's house and went to Tuohedashi's place. Tuohedashi used to have less than twenty livestock, but now he has seventy or eighty. Tuohedashi warmly received him, inviting him to drink tea and smoke cigarettes. Mylaike said: "It seems that your life is much better than before." Tuohedashi replied jokingly: "I think, are you sleeping? Otherwise, how can you ask such a question? Now, who's life is not happy?" Tuohedashi also told Mylaike his plan to breed livestock.

    The facts vividly educated Mylaike, making him realize that his previous thoughts were completely wrong.

    Musa's thinking has also undergone fundamental changes. He personally saw the veterinarian sent by the people's government treating livestock for free; the trade team also brought cloth, salt, matches, tea and sugar..., and the prices were much cheaper than before. The trade team not only purchased good wool, but also purchased wool of poor quality. All this made Musa feel that he had been wrong in the past.

    Brother Mylaike freed themselves from painful thoughts. The two brothers devoted themselves to raising the remaining livestock. As soon as it was dawn, they drove the livestock out, and when it was hot at noon, they drove the livestock into the shade of the trees. At night, they took turns guarding the herd to prevent wild animals from harming them.

    This year, when people were celebrating the third harvest season, Brother Mylaike also achieved a bumper harvest: each person's livestock has developed to more than fifty, including forty sheep, nine horses and six cattle. Mylaike also plans to buy a stallion to breed horses. (Attached picture)

    麦拉柯弟兄
    本报记者  朱波
    居住在特克斯县深山里的柯尔克孜族人民，主要依靠牧畜业维持生活。在旧社会里，他们因受尽反动统治者的压迫和掠夺，牲畜一天比一天减少，生活陷入悲惨的境地。解放后，柯族同胞怀着极大的希望开始了新的生活；但是有少数人，心上却像压上一块沉重的石头似的，觉得很不安，他们对党和人民政府的牧区政策抱着怀疑的态度。麦拉柯和木萨就是这样一种人。
    麦拉柯和木萨是亲弟兄。他们在父母去世后不久就分居了。他们每人有五、六十只牲畜。
    解放后，麦拉柯弟兄也和别人一样，兴奋地迎接着新时代的到来。但是没有多久，当别人都在计划增加牲畜的时候，麦拉柯弟兄却躲在帐房里发愁。他们耽心着未来的生活，顾虑着自己牲畜的命运。
    麦拉柯到了牧民依明江家里，想把自己的问题提出来问问他。他走进帐房，瞧见依明江神色异常，脸上带着一副愁容。依明江的女人和孩子们也都愁眉不展地围着他坐着。依明江招呼麦拉柯坐下，问道：“你觉得生活会好吗？”麦拉柯回答说：“我说不出来，我倒想问问你呢！”依明江闷闷不乐地说：“我耽心着我的牧群会被没收。”他说完就低下了头。
    麦拉柯失望地离开了依明江，因为自己的问题没有得到解决。在回家的路上，他痛苦地沉思着。
    木萨也从外边回来了。他皱着眉头对麦拉柯说：“我问了好几家，他们也都在为这件事情耽心。夏尔希老人说：我活了七十岁了，曾经历过几个朝代，没有见过那一个朝代对柯族人民是有利的。”木萨停了停又说：“我们的牲畜没有别人的多，也许不至于被没收吧！”麦拉柯听了木萨的话，就想：这是可能的，那些牲畜少的人家不是什么都不怕吗？他们还在努力繁殖牲畜哩。后来又想到：我的牲畜虽然不比依明江的多，可是我家人口比依明江家少，如果这样比起来，我的牲畜可并不算少啊！想到这里，他又难过起来了。
    有一次，从区里来了一个工作人员。人们都说这是共产党的区委书记，他是来帮助柯族人民安排新生活的。牧民们都从帐房里跑出来，争着和他握手。但是，麦拉柯却没有挤过去和区委书记握手。从此，麦拉柯的顾虑就更加重了。他一回家就躺下，心里发愁，连饭也不想吃。他老是想着：这次可真糟了。区委书记没有和我握手问好，那显然是讨厌我的表示呀！
    麦拉柯和木萨为了企图摆脱这种思想上的苦恼，悄悄地从这里迁到了牧场的边沿上。
    他们离开老家以后，思想上的疙瘩并没有消除。他们对每个过路人也都心怀疑惧。有一天，木萨对麦拉柯说：“我们的苦恼是由牲畜引起的，如果牲畜少了，不就好了吗？”麦拉柯说：“可是我们的牲畜并不少呀！”木萨出了一个主意：“要使牲畜减少，那是容易办到的，譬如说，我们可以把它们杀死吃掉，或用低价卖出去，或者把它们当礼物送人……。”麦拉柯摇了摇头：“这办法恐怕不行。要是有人追问，我们怎样回答呢？”木萨又想了一个主意。他说，如果有人追问为什么要杀死牲畜，就说是被毒蛇咬坏了的；要是别人问为什么要把牲畜送人，就说过去欠了别人的债，现在人家把牲畜要走了。麦拉柯对这个办法终于表示了同意。
    木萨夫妇，过去把牲畜看作自己的生命一样，经常为着它们起早摸黑；现在，他俩对自己的牲畜完全采取了另一种态度：让牲畜散乱地走在帐房附近，啃那些枯萎了的野草；隔不几天就杀一只羊吃，吃饱后就躺在帐房里睡觉。麦拉柯也经常杀牲畜吃，或者把牲畜送给人。有一次他用一头乳牛，为他的妻子换来一件裙子的布料。麦拉柯弟兄俩的牲畜一天比一天减少了，剩下的牲畜也逐渐瘦下来了。
    一九五二年春天，有一次麦拉柯从野地里拾柴回来，遇见从县城回来的热合木江。麦拉柯暗想：这家伙有很多牲畜，怎么敢上县城去呢？为什么他还这样高兴呢？他问热合木江：“你为什么这样高兴呢？莫非有了喜事？”热合木江笑着从马上跳下来，拍着麦拉柯的肩头说：“是啊，我有了喜事。现在，我是牧民代表了，刚刚从伊犁开会回来，专员曾和我谈了话！”“牧民代表”、“专员”这一类词汇，在麦拉柯听来都是生疏的。他就问热合木江，那是什么意思。热合木江兴奋地说：“牧民代表吗，就是……，呶，这可怎样才能给你解释清楚呢？他得负责教育牧民，要牧民好好保护牲畜，发展畜牧业，帮助牧民建立新生活。专员吗，是我们的上级，你也可以叫他首长。”热合木江还把大会赠送给他的笔记本拿出来给麦拉柯看。
    听了热合木江的话，麦拉柯在思想上有了一些变化，他开始意识到自己想错了。但他对热合木江的话，还不是完全相信的。他又走到交达家里，见交达和他的女人从县城买回了两匹种马。交达现在有了三十匹马，二十头乳牛，还有五百多只羊，而且牲畜都喂得又肥又壮。麦拉柯从交达家出来，又到了托合达希那里。托合达希过去没有喂过二十只牲畜，现在却有七、八十只了。托合达希热情地招待他，请他喝茶、抽纸烟。麦拉柯说：“看来，你的生活比过去好多了。”托合达希开玩笑地回答：“我看，你莫非在睡觉吧，要不，怎么还能提这样的问题，现在，谁的生活不幸福呢？”托合达希还把自己的繁殖牲畜的计划告诉了麦拉柯。
    事实生动地教育了麦拉柯，使他认识到他以前的想法完全是错误的。
    木萨的思想也起了根本的变化。他亲眼看见人民政府派来的兽医，免费给牧民治疗牲畜；贸易小组又给带来了布匹、食盐、火柴、茶叶和糖……，价格比过去要便宜得多。贸易小组不仅收购好羊毛，还收购质量差的羊毛。这一切使木萨感到自己过去想错了。
    麦拉柯弟兄从痛苦的思想里摆脱出来了。弟兄俩专心一意地饲养剩下的牲畜。天一亮他们就把牲畜赶出去，中午天热的时候，就把牲畜赶进树荫里去。夜晚，他们还轮流着守在牧群旁边，防止野兽对它们的侵害。
    今年，当人们都在欢度第三个丰收季节的时候，麦拉柯弟兄也获得了丰收：每人的牲畜又发展到五十多只，其中有羊四十只，马九匹和牛六头。麦拉柯还准备买一匹种马，繁殖马群。（附图片）
