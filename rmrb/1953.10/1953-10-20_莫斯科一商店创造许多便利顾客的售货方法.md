    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 19th: The trade staff of the textile department of the Shebakov Department Store in Moscow have created many sales methods that benefit customers, which are widely welcomed by customers.
    The Shebakov Department Store is not a very large store, but it is well-known among Moscow residents and trade workers. The store is full of certificates of "Excellent Service." The advanced working method of the textile department in this store is to give customers the greatest opportunity to choose goods according to their interests, obtain the goods quickly, and reduce waiting time and crowding. In addition, the staff of the textile department also carefully study customer needs and help factories to improve production.
    The sales windows of the textile department display goods sold by the piece, such as towels, headscarves, napkins, etc. Each item has a label with the price on it. Under each type of goods is a small box containing pre-written labels for the goods displayed in the window. If a customer needs to buy a towel, they take a label from the small box under that type of goods, pay at the cashier, and can immediately get the goods at the delivery counter. In this way, customers do not need to wait in front of the sales counter for the salesperson to get the goods, thus reducing waiting time and crowding. After adopting this method, the sales volume of goods sold by the piece has greatly increased. For example, previously only a dozen or so napkins could be sold per week, but in recent months, 700 have been sold.
    On the other side of the textile department hang samples of about sixty or seventy kinds of fabrics sold that day. Here are clothing models, with the middle hollowed out, and can be moved left and right where the samples are hung. Customers can move the model to the fabric they have chosen and see what the clothes will look like when made from this fabric through the hollow model. This is of great help to customers choosing clothing materials. Each fabric sample on display has a number, and customers only need to say the number for the salesperson to quickly find the goods. When the salesperson hands the goods to the delivery counter, they also attach a colored wooden sign so that the delivery counter can quickly find the goods purchased by the customer.
    The store's delivery counter has a box containing more than 160 cards. Each card has a small piece of fabric attached to it. These cards record the quantity sold and sales situation every day. In this way, these materials can be summarized and analyzed monthly to study customer needs, and then notify the factory to help the factory improve production. This method enables stores and factories to study customer needs based on accurate numerical materials.
    The textile department has twelve staff members who love their work and care about the needs of the people, so they constantly study and improve their business. Since 1949, they have received the title of "Excellent Customer Service Department" every month.

    莫斯科一商店创造许多便利顾客的售货方法
    【新华社莫斯科十九日电】莫斯科谢巴科夫百货商店纺织品部的贸易工作人员，创造了许多便利顾客的售货方法，受到顾客的普遍欢迎。
    谢巴科夫百货商店不是一个很大的商店，但在莫斯科居民和贸易工作者当中却很有名。商店内挂满了“服务优异”的奖状。这个商店纺织品部的先进工作方法，就是让顾客有按照自己的兴趣挑选货品的最大机会，并能很快地得到货物，减少等待的时间和拥挤。此外，纺织品部的工作人员还认真研究顾客的需要，帮助工厂来改进生产。
    纺织品部的售货橱窗内陈列着按件出售的货品，如毛巾、头巾、餐巾等类。每件货品附近都有着写上价格的标号。每类货品下面有一个小匣子，里面放着预先写好的橱窗内所陈列的货品的标签。顾客如需要购买一条毛巾，就在这类货品下面的小匣中取出一张标签，到收款处付款后，就立刻可以在发货处得到货物。这样，顾客就不需要在售货柜的面前等待售货员拿货，因而减少了等待时间和拥挤。采用这个方法后，按件出售的货品的销售量大大地增加了。例如，以前每星期只能售十多条餐巾，而最近几个月来就售出了七百条。
    在纺织品部的另一边挂着当天出售的约六、七十种布匹的样品。这里摆着衣服模型，模型中间是挖空的，可以在挂样品的地方左右移动。顾客移动这个模型放到他所选择的布料上，可以从这个中空的模型中看到用这种布料做成衣服以后的样子。这对选择衣料的顾客有很大的帮助。每一件陈列出来的布料样品上都有号码，顾客只需要说出号码，售货员就能立刻找到货品。售货员在把货品交到发货处时，还附上一块有色的木牌，这样发货处就可以很快地找到顾客所购买的货物。
    商店的发货处放有一个装着一百六十多张卡片的匣子。每张卡片上贴着一小块布样，这些卡片上每天记载着卖出的数量和销售情况。这样每月便可按照这些材料进行总结分析，研究顾客的需要，然后通知工厂，以便帮助工厂改进生产。这种方法就使商店和工厂可以根据确实的数字材料研究顾客的需要。
    纺织品部有十二个工作人员，他们热爱自己的工作，关心人民的需要，因此不断地研究和改进了业务。从一九四九年以来，他们每个月都得到“优异为顾客服务部”的称号。
