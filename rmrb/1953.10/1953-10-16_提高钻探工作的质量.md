Improving the Quality of Drilling Work
    Luo Liangzhi

Drilling is an important method for exploring underground mineral resources. Through drilling, we can explore the depth, thickness, and existence of underground rocks and minerals; we can use it to collect rock cores and mineral cores for physical identification and chemical analysis to determine the composition and grade of useful minerals; through drilling, we can also explore underground water levels and the water permeability of rocks, providing measures and methods for designing mining operations.

Although the drilling work in the geological exploration of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry has achieved certain results, there are still many shortcomings in terms of quality. In particular, blindly pursuing footage while neglecting quality (core recovery rate) has become an extremely prominent shortcoming. For example, in a certain area of Benxi in April, the drilling task was completed by 267 percent, but the average core recovery rate was only 60 percent (including mineral cores). In the Cishan area, the core recovery rate in April and May was less than 40 percent. Furthermore, the average core recovery rate of the system under the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Bureau from January to May was only 52 percent, with three locations reaching only 36 to 39 percent. A drilling site of Yunnan Tin Company drilled 270 meters, but the core recovery rate was only 40 percent. Moreover, the collected cores were greatly lost due to poor storage. In Anshan, one borehole was scrapped due to errors in the original core records.

In addition, the large number of accidents in drilling work is also a serious problem. For example, accidents at the Xiuyan Temple site in Dongchuan accounted for 60 percent of the downtime; accidents in the system under the Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Bureau accounted for 44 percent of the downtime from January to May; in Anshan, one site had ten drilling rigs experiencing thirteen consecutive accidents in May, with two boreholes being abandoned due to serious and unrecoverable accidents; before May, fifteen boreholes were drilled in a certain iron mine in the Southwest, of which seven showed no ore at all, and some ore samples were very small; in a certain area of Benxi, one drilling rig was scrapped due to an incorrect direction. Accidents in other areas are also very serious.

The above examples show that the quality of the current drilling work is very poor and accidents are serious. To change this situation, the following points should be noted in future drilling work:

(1) Ensure the quality of drilling work and comprehensively complete the state's tasks. It should be pointed out that if the drilling work only completes the footage and neglects the core recovery or the direction of the borehole, the depth, thickness, and changes in the strata and minerals, and the hydrological conditions, the drilling work will become a meaningless blind action. Not only that, but it will also cause greater waste. Therefore, merely completing the footage task cannot be considered completing the drilling task. Drilling personnel should realize that the purpose of drilling is to obtain results and solve geological exploration problems, not just to drill a hole. Therefore, the core and mineral core recovery rate must meet the state's requirements, and the borehole must maintain the designed angle and direction from beginning to end. Various rock and hydrological records must be accurate and reliable, and columnar charts should be submitted promptly after completion.

(2) Drilling work must be carried out according to the requirements of geological work. Drilling work is a part of geological exploration work, so it cannot be separated from the guidance of geological work and carried out in isolation. One of the main reasons for the poor quality of the current drilling work, and even the drilling of abandoned holes, is that the relationship between drilling work and geological work is not close or normal. In future drilling construction, drilling workers should actively listen to the specific guidance of geological personnel, strive to meet geological requirements, and try to avoid the phenomenon of drilling work being divorced from geological work.

(3) Strictly abide by operating procedures and implement the responsibility system. The reasons for "low efficiency," "poor quality," and "many accidents" are inseparable from the failure to strictly abide by operating procedures and the phenomenon of no one being responsible or being irresponsible in construction. If a drilling site lacks the necessary rules and regulations, or does not carry out drilling according to the rules and regulations, it will inevitably ruin the work and cause irreparable losses. Therefore, it is necessary to establish and improve "technical operating procedures," "technical responsibility system," "technical safety system," "original record system," "shift handover system," and "core collection and storage system." After the rules and regulations are established, workers should be constantly educated, and engineering management departments should frequently go to the site to inspect and guide the work. Various methods and measures should be taken to mobilize the masses and carry out the responsibility system movement, so that these rules and regulations are fully implemented and consolidated on the basis of the masses' consciousness. In addition, a "accident reporting" and "borehole appraisal" system should also be established in drilling work. When an accident occurs at the drilling site, the real situation should be quickly reported to the team headquarters, and after careful research, work should begin to deal with it, strictly preventing accidents from occurring again in the accident. After the accident is resolved, the lessons and experience of resolving the accident should be summarized in a timely manner, and the entire staff should be educated. Before the drilling rig is installed, the geological department and the engineering management unit should check whether its direction angle meets the design requirements and whether the mechanical quality strength load is normal. After the borehole is completed, the depth of the borehole, the quality of the core, and the hydrological records should be inspected on site, and an appraisal should be made based on its degree, and finally an appraisal certificate should be issued.

(4) Strengthen political education and organize business learning. Drilling work is generally carried out in remote areas with inconvenient transportation. Due to inconvenient management and lack of regular political education, the organization and discipline of workers are easily weakened. A certain number of political workers must be equipped in the drilling team or construction site to strengthen on-site political education, so as to improve the political awareness of workers, give full play to the initiative and creativity of workers, overcome difficulties, and complete the drilling task. With the development of national economic construction, drilling departments have increased a large number of new workers this year, and their technical level has not yet caught up with the needs of the work. Under this circumstance, drilling departments should actively organize workers to conduct business learning. If it is inconvenient to concentrate some due to the scattered areas, different forms should be used for learning and education according to the specific conditions of the site. The general purpose is to improve the technical and business capabilities of workers. In order to ensure the quality of drilling and complete the state plan on schedule, it is also necessary to promote advanced experience in the work to ensure the comprehensive completion of drilling tasks.

    提高钻探工作的质量
    罗亮志
    钻探是探明地下矿产的一个重要方法。通过钻探可以探明地下岩石和矿物的深度、厚度和矿床生存的状态；可以利用它采取岩心、矿心，进行物理鉴定和化学分析，以判明有用矿物的成分和品位；通过钻探还可探明地下水位情况和岩石的透水性质，据以提供设计开采的措施和方法。
    中央重工业部地质勘探中的钻探工作虽然获得了一定的成绩，但从质量方面来看，还存在许多缺点，特别是盲目追求进尺，忽视质量（岩心采取率）成为一个极其突出的缺点。如本溪某地四月份的钻探任务完成了百分之二百六十七，但是岩心采取率平均只有百分之六十（包括矿心）。磁山地区的钻探工作，在四、五月间的岩心采取率，还不到百分之四十，又如有色金属工业管理局所属系统一月份至五月份的岩心采取率平均只达百分之五十二，其中有三处则仅达百分之三十六到三十九，云南锡业公司一个钻场打了二百七十公尺，岩心采取率只达百分之四十。而且因保管不好，所采岩心损失很大。鞍山有一个钻孔因岩心原始记录错误而报废。
    另外在钻探工作中，事故多也是一个严重的问题。如东川岫岩寺处的事故，停工时间占了百分之六十；有色金属工业管理局所属系统一月份至五月份的事故，停工时间就占去百分之四十四；鞍山某处五月份一个月中有十台钻机连续发生十三次事故，其中有二个钻孔因事故严重不能恢复而造成废孔；西南某铁矿的钻探在五月份以前打了十五个，其中有七个孔完全未见矿，有的矿样取得很少；本溪某地有一台钻机因方位搞错而废孔，其他地区的事故也很严重。
    以上所举的这些例子，说明目前钻探工作的质量是十分低劣的，事故是严重的，为了改变这种情况，今后钻探工作应注意以下几点：
    （一）保证钻探工作的质量，全面完成国家任务。应当指出，钻探工作若仅仅完成了进尺而忽视岩心的采取或钻孔的方向，岩石矿物的深度、厚度、层次的变化及水文情况，就会使钻探工作变成毫无意义的盲目行动，不但如此，反而会造成更大的浪费，因此仅仅完成进尺任务是不能算完成钻探任务的。钻探人员应当认识到钻探的目的是为了获得效果，解决地质勘探的问题，不是为了钻一个孔就算了事。所以在岩心和矿心的采取率上一定要保证达到国家的要求，钻孔自始至终要保持设计上的角度和方向，各种岩层水文记录，要确实可靠，柱状图表应于竣工后及时提出。
    （二）钻探工作必须依据地质工作的要求去进行。钻探工作是地质勘探工作一部分，因此不能脱离地质工作的指导而孤立地进行。目前钻探工作质量低劣，甚至钻成废孔的主要原因之一，就是钻探工作和地质工作的关系不密切、不正常。今后的钻探施工中，钻探工作人员应主动听从地质人员的具体指导，力求合乎地质上的要求，极力避免钻探工作与地质工作脱节的现象。
    （三）严守操作规程，贯彻责任制度。“效率低”、“质量差”、“事故多”的原因是和没有很好地遵守操作规程及施工中无人负责或不负责任的现象分不开的。一个钻场如缺乏必要的规程和制度，或不按规程制度去进行钻探，就必然会把工作搞坏而造成不可挽回的损失，因此必须建立和健全“技术操作规程”、“技术责任制”、“技术保安制度”、“原始记录制度”、“交接班制度”、“岩心采取保管制度”等。规程与制度建立后，应经常不断地向职工进行教育，工程管理部门，应经常到现场检查和指导工作，要采取各种办法和措施，发动群众，开展责任制运动，使这些规程制度，在群众自觉的基础上充分贯彻和巩固起来。另外在钻探工作中，还要建立“事故报告”和“钻孔鉴定”制度，钻场发生事故时，应将真实情况迅速向队部报告，经慎重研究后，着手处理，严防在事故中再发生事故，事故解除后，要及时总结教训和解除事故的经验，向全体职工进行教育。钻机尚未安装之前，应由地质部门和工程管理单位来检查其方向角度是否合乎设计要求，机械质量强度负荷是否正常，钻孔竣工后，要到现场验收钻孔的深度，岩心质量，水文记录，根据它的程度进行鉴定，最后发给鉴定书。
    （四）加强政治教育，组织业务学习。钻探工作一般都是在交通不便的偏僻地区进行，由于管理不便，缺乏经常的政治教育，职工的组织性纪律性很容易涣散下去，在钻探队或施工现场一定要配备一定数量的政治工作人员，加强现场的政治教育工作，以提高职工的政治觉悟，发挥工人的积极性和创造性，克服困难，完成钻探任务。随着国家经济建设的发展，钻探部门今年都增加了大批新的工人，技术水平都还赶不上工作需要。在这种情况下，钻探部门应积极组织工人进行业务学习，有的因地区分散不便集中时，应根据现场具体情况，利用不同形式来学习和教育，总的目的是要提高工人的技术业务能力。为保证钻探质量与按期完成国家计划，还必须推广工作中的先进经验，以保证全面完成钻探任务。
