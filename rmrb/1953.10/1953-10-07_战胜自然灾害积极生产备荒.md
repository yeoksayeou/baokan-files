    Overcoming Natural Disasters and Actively Engaging in Production for Famine Preparedness

      (I)
    Readers Zhang Yongshu, Guo Shiquan, and Gao Xiuyan write: This spring, wheat in Madian Village, Yingshang County, Anhui Province, suffered from frost, and autumn crops suffered from drought. Communist Party member Zhang Keyu led everyone to overcome difficulties and find ways to survive the famine. The village has now dried 370 bamboo baskets of sesame leaves for mixing with grain for cooking this winter and next spring, which can抵 (be equivalent to) more than 3,000 catties of grain. During the autumn harvest, they plan to collect and dry sweet potato leaves, estimating that the whole village can collect more than 7,000 catties. They are also starting to plant early-maturing crops, interplanting vegetables in all idle land, lake land, and wheat fields, and tidying up the empty spaces in front of and behind houses to grow vegetables. The plan is for the whole village to plant 150 mu of vegetables this year, ensuring that there is no idle land. In addition, the whole village will plant 110 mu of barley and 75 mu of broad beans, so that they can have an early harvest. Currently, everyone in the village has the confidence to overcome natural disasters and survive the famine.

    Ma Yongxun, of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Qianxi County Committee, Hebei, writes: After Yuhuzhai Township in our county's First District suffered from flooding, the masses in the entire township have been actively salvaging the remnants of the autumn harvest and carrying out autumn harvesting and planting to increase production and conserve for famine preparedness. Under the leadership of Li Cuihua, the director of the township women's association, and deputy directors Li Suhuan and committee member Li Sulan, women are not only actively participating in the autumn harvest and repairing roads, but also, based on local characteristics, gathering acorns, harvesting pine nuts, picking mushrooms, drying vegetables, cutting dried pears, and picking sweet potato vine leaves. Women Liu Cuilian and Gao Herui from Xigou Village, under the leadership of Party member Yin Zhiping, go to the mountains to pick acorns together every day after breakfast, and have gathered 120 catties of acorns in five days, while also ensuring that cooking, going to the mountains, and working in the fields are not delayed. The women have also demonstrated the spirit of class friendship in conserving for famine preparedness. For example, when the sweet potato fields of ten disaster-stricken farmers were washed away by the flood, Li Cuihua and thirty other households with sweet potato vines were willing to let them have the leaves to dry. Now, the masses in the entire township have the confidence to survive the famine.

    战胜自然灾害积极生产备荒
      （一）
    读者张永舒、郭世全、高秀言来信：安徽省颍上县马店村今年春天麦子遭了霜灾，秋季作物又遭到旱灾，共产党员张克玉就带动大家克服困难，找渡荒办法。全村现在已晒好三百七十笆斗干芝麻叶，以备今冬和明春掺粮做饭吃，能抵三千多斤粮食。秋收时准备把红芋叶子也收起来晒干，估计全村可收七千多斤。大家又着手种早熟作物，所有闲地、湖地、麦地都间种上菜，屋前屋后的空地也都整理出来种上菜蔬，计划全村今年要种一百五十亩菜，做到全村无闲地。此外，全村要种大麦一百一十亩，蚕豆七十五亩，这样就可以早接嘴。目前全村的人都有信心战胜天灾，渡过灾荒。
      （二）
    中共河北迁西县委宣传部马永勋来信：我县一区渔户寨乡遭受水灾后，全乡群众为了增加生产、节约备荒，都积极地打捞残秋和进行秋收秋种。妇女们在乡妇女主任李萃华、副主任李素环、委员李素兰等的带领下，除积极参加秋收、修补道路外，又根据本地的特点，做拣橡子、打松子、拾蘑菇、晒干菜、切梨干、拣白薯秧叶子等活。西沟村妇女刘翠莲和高贺瑞等三人，在党员尹志萍的带动下，每天吃完早饭一齐上山拣橡子，五天就打了一百二十斤橡子，而且做到了做饭、上山、下地都不误。妇女们在节约备荒中还发扬了阶级友爱精神，如有十户受灾农民的白薯地被水冲净了，李萃华等三十户有白薯秧子的就情愿自家不采，让给他们晒叶子。现在全乡群众都有信心渡过灾荒。
