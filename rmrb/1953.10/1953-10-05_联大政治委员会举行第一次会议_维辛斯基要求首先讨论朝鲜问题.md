UN Political Committee Holds First Meeting
Vyshinsky Demands Priority Discussion of Korean Question

[Xinhua News Agency, New York, 3rd] (TASS dispatch from New York, 2nd) The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held its first meeting on September 30th. After electing the Colombian representative as Vice-Chairman and the Icelandic representative as Rapporteur, the meeting addressed the order of consideration for the various items on the committee's agenda. The Colombian representative suggested placing the Korean question last on the agenda.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, pointed out that the Colombian representative's argument for delaying the discussion of the Korean question was absolutely untenable. He noted that it was now abundantly clear that the United States, Britain, France, and certain other member states of the United Nations, wanted to avoid discussing this most acute and important issue—the Korean question. The Soviet delegation believed that this intention was wrong. The Chinese and Korean governments disagreed with the resolution on convening a political conference passed by the General Assembly on August 28th and had put forward their own proposals aimed at ensuring the success of the political conference. To ensure the smooth convening of the political conference, it was necessary to resolve the differences on this issue as soon as possible. The United Nations should not evade discussion of these differences. The representatives of the United States and Britain, and the delegations that supported them, were trying to avoid discussing the Korean question, which in fact hindered the convening of the political conference.

Referring to the proposal by the US representative, Lodge, that the political conference itself should decide on its membership, Vyshinsky pointed out: Lodge's suggestion was not serious because he implied that the US would insist on the view in the UN General Assembly's resolution of August 28th on excluding neutral countries from participating in the political conference.

Vyshinsky firmly demanded that the Political Committee discuss the Korean question first. He emphasized that this question was extremely important and extremely urgent. It must be considered that there was not much time left before the deadline for convening the political conference. He urged the Committee to pay attention to the words of Syngman Rhee and his supporters about wanting to resolve the Korean question by force. These words created a situation that the United Nations must intervene in according to the Charter.

Vyshinsky also suggested that after discussing the Korean question, the Committee should immediately discuss the question of measures to eliminate the threat of another world war and ease international tensions.

Representatives of the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand spoke in support of Colombia's proposal and opposed the Soviet proposal. US representative Lodge insisted that there was no need for the UN to discuss the Korean question at this time, especially since negotiations were underway in Korea (in fact, everyone knows that no negotiations are taking place). He said that the Chinese and Korean governments had not provided any reason in their replies regarding the membership of the political conference to change the General Assembly's resolution on the political conference passed on August 28th. Lodge's words once again showed that his own proposal to let the political conference itself decide its membership was highly questionable in terms of sincerity.

Lodge also said that the Committee should postpone discussion of the Kuomintang's aggression against Burma until later. He said that developments that would ease the tension there might arise in the near future. The Burmese representative, in reply to Lodge, pointed out that the Bangkok negotiations had broken down and that there was currently no hope of resolving the issue. The Burmese representative opposed the Committee postponing the discussion of Burma's complaint against the Kuomintang's acts of aggression.

While supporting the Colombian proposal, the Australian representative proposed an amendment stipulating that the Korean question could be brought up for discussion at any time if a majority of the Committee so requested.

Representatives of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, and Byelorussia successively spoke in support of the Soviet delegation's proposal.

The Pakistani representative argued for postponing the discussion of the Korean question to a "more appropriate time."

The Indian representative, Menon, advocated "slightly postponing" the discussion of the Korean question. He believed that this would allow the United Nations to continue exchanging views in writing with the Chinese and Korean governments. He pointed out that the Political Committee should discuss the Secretary-General's report on the replies from the Chinese and Korean governments. Menon said that the Indian delegation could not agree with the resolution passed by the General Assembly on August 28th, because it placed the sixteen countries that had sent troops to Korea above other UN member states. The Indian representative believed that Burma's complaint should be given priority, because postponing this issue as suggested by the US representative would only worsen the current situation in Burma.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, spoke again at the meeting, refuting the arguments of those who opposed the Soviet proposal regarding the order of the Political Committee's agenda. Vyshinsky pointed out that those who opposed the Soviet proposal neither wanted to discuss the Korean question nor wanted to invite the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion, thereby creating difficulties for the convening of the Korean political conference.

The meeting finally proceeded to a vote. The majority of countries, led by the United States, voted to pass Colombia's proposal, which was to put the Korean question last on the agenda. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and France voted against it. India, Burma, Indonesia, Afghanistan, and Iran abstained. The Political Committee also passed the Australian amendment regarding the Committee's ability to change the agenda order in the future by a majority vote. Representatives of the Soviet Union and other countries voted against it. The US representative and the Kuomintang elements also opposed this amendment, apparently fearing that even such an amendment would pose some threat to the US strategy of delaying the discussion of the Korean question.

After this, the Chairman of the Political Committee announced that the next meeting of the Political Committee would be held on October 7th to discuss the first item on the agenda—the Moroccan question.

### 联大政治委员会举行第一次会议  维辛斯基要求首先讨论朝鲜问题

    联大政治委员会举行第一次会议
    维辛斯基要求首先讨论朝鲜问题
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社纽约二日讯：联合国大会政治委员会于九月三十日举行第一次会议。会议选出哥伦比亚代表为委员会副主席和冰岛代表为报告员后，就讨论列入该委员会议程的各个项目的审议次序。哥伦比亚代表建议把朝鲜问题放在最后讨论。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基指出哥伦比亚代表主张延缓讨论朝鲜问题的论点是绝对站不住脚的。他指出，现在十分明显的是，美国、英国、法国以及联合国其它某些会员国，想要规避讨论这个最尖锐、最重要的问题——朝鲜问题。苏联代表团认为这种意图是错误的。中朝政府不同意八月二十八日大会所通过的关于召开政治会议的决议，并提出了他们自己的旨在保证政治会议成功的建议。为使政治会议得以顺利召开，有必要尽速解决在这个问题上的分歧。联合国决不应规避讨论这些分歧。美国和英国的代表以及支持他们的代表团，都尽力规避讨论朝鲜问题，事实上这就阻碍了政治会议的召开。
    维辛斯基在谈到美国代表洛奇提出的应由政治会议本身来决定该会议的成员的建议时指出：洛奇暗示说，在会议成员问题上，美国将坚持联合国大会八月二十八日关于排斥中立国家参加政治会议的决议里的观点，就说明洛奇的建议是不严肃的。
    维辛斯基坚决要求政治委员会首先讨论朝鲜问题。他强调说，这个问题是极其重要、极其紧迫的。必须考虑到，现在离召开政治会议的限期为时已经不多了。他促请委员会注意李承晚和他的支持者所说的关于想用武力解决朝鲜问题的话。这些话造成了一种根据宪章联合国必须过问的形势。
    维辛斯基并建议在讨论了朝鲜问题之后，立即讨论关于消除另一次世界大战威胁和缓和国际紧张局势的措施问题。
    美、英、澳大利亚和新西兰等国代表都发言支持哥伦比亚的建议，并反对苏联的建议。美国代表洛奇硬说现在联合国没有必要讨论朝鲜问题，尤其是因为谈判正在朝鲜进行（事实上，大家知道，并无任何谈判在进行）。他说，中朝政府关于政治会议成员问题的答复中没有提供任何理由，来改变大会八月二十八日通过的关于政治会议的决议。洛奇的话又一次说明，他自己提出的让政治会议本身去决定其成员这一建议是否诚恳是大成疑问的。
    洛奇还说，委员会应该把国民党分子对缅甸进行侵略的问题延缓到较后去讨论。他说，最近将来可能产生一种使那里的紧张局势缓和的发展。缅甸代表在答复洛奇时指出，曼谷谈判已经破裂，目前这个问题没有解决的希望。缅甸代表反对委员会延缓讨论缅甸对国民党侵略行动的控诉。
    澳大利亚代表在支持哥伦比亚建议的同时，又对这个建议提出一项修正，规定委员会有过半数提出要求，朝鲜问题就随时都可以提出来讨论。
    波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰及白俄罗斯代表相继发言，支持苏联代表团的建议。
    巴基斯坦代表主张把朝鲜问题的讨论延期到“比较适当的时机”。
    印度代表梅农主张把朝鲜问题“稍为推迟一点”再讨论。他认为这样可以使联合国能继续和中朝政府以书面交换意见。他指出，政治委员会应该讨论秘书长关于中朝政府复电的报告。梅农说，印度代表团不能同意大会八月二十八日通过的决议，因为这把十六个派有军队在朝鲜的国家置于其他联合国会员国之上。印度代表认为缅甸的控诉案应该列为优先讨论的问题，因为如果按照美国代表的建议把这问题延到以后再讨论，那就只会使缅甸目前的局势更加恶化。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在会上再度发言，驳斥了反对苏联关于政委会议程次序的建议的人们的论点。维辛斯基指出，反对苏联建议的人既不愿讨论朝鲜问题，又不愿邀请中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国参加讨论，他们这样就为朝鲜政治会议的召开制造了困难。
    会议最后进行表决。以美国为首的多数国家投票通过哥伦比亚的建议，就是把朝鲜问题放到最后讨论。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和法国投反对票。印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、阿富汗和伊朗弃权。政委会并以多数通过了澳大利亚关于委员会以后可以改变议程次序的修正案。苏联等国代表投票反对。美国代表和国民党分子也反对这个修正案，显然他们害怕即使这样一个修正案也会对美国拖延朝鲜问题讨论的策略发生某些威胁。
    在这以后，政委会主席宣布政委会下一次会议在十月七日召开，讨论议程的第一项——摩洛哥问题。
