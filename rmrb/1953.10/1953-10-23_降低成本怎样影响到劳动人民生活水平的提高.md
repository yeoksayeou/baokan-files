    How Cost Reduction Affects the Improvement of the People's Living Standards
    Soviet Union Mo Wolkov
    "Pravda" reader F. Kiriyenko from Novo-Georgievsk, Coastal Region, requests an explanation: What is the significance of reducing product costs for improving the welfare of the Soviet people?
    Caring for the welfare of the people is the supreme law of the Communist Party's activities. The Party, in full accordance with the requirements of the basic socialist economic law, tirelessly struggles to maximize the satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society.
    Improving the material well-being of the Soviet people is based on the continuous growth and improvement of socialist production on a high technical foundation.
    Reducing costs and increasing labor productivity in all sectors of production is of decisive significance for improving the living standards of the Soviet people. Cost in the socialist economy is the monetary expression of the expenses required for state-owned enterprises to produce and sell products. Cost is the most important qualitative indicator of all production activities of an enterprise.
    Reducing costs to increase labor productivity is based on strict economy in the use of raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity. The correct use of machinery and equipment, rationalization of production organization, acceleration of capital turnover, and reduction of administrative expenses are of great significance. Under the socialist system, the saving of social labor is manifested in the reduction of product costs, which enables society to expand the scale of production and social wealth with the same amount of labor expenditure. The Soviet people reduce costs, thereby further increasing social production and expanding national income. The growth of the Soviet national income is the most vivid indicator of the rise of socialist social wealth and the welfare of the entire people.
    The economic effect of reducing costs grows simultaneously with the expansion of the scale of socialist production. In 1931, a 1% reduction in the cost of industrial products provided 150 million to 200 million rubles for accumulation, but by 1950, the funds saved by a 1% reduction in the cost of industrial products exceeded 4 billion rubles.
    The directives of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party regarding the Fifth Five-Year Plan defined the task of further reducing the cost of industrial products. On the whole, the cost of industrial products will be reduced by about 25%, the cost of construction projects will be reduced by at least 20%, the cost of railway transportation will be reduced by 15%, and the cost of tractor work at agricultural machinery stations will be reduced by about 25%. Completing the task of reducing costs will provide the state with huge savings, the scale of which can be seen from the following figures: In 1951, the funds saved by reducing the cost of industrial products (including the reduction of wholesale prices) were 35.5 billion rubles, and by 1952, the amount of savings exceeded 46 billion rubles. However, failure to complete the task of reducing costs stipulated by the state plan will cause significant damage to the national economy. For example, in 1952, losses incurred by some industrial enterprises due to their inability to make profits amounted to 16 billion rubles, which could have been used to expand social wealth and improve the living standards of the working people.
    As pointed out by the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, there are many unprofitable enterprises in the coal mining industry and the timber industry, with extremely large losses. Many enterprises in these sectors are constantly unprofitable, failing to complete the plan to reduce product costs and increase labor productivity, and are not properly managing wealth resources and monetary resources. The high cost of coal and timber has an adverse impact on the cost of various other industrial products and also hinders the reduction of prices for mass consumer goods. Many construction organizations and agricultural machinery stations, as well as inland river transport workers, are unsatisfactory in their efforts to reduce costs; the situation in reducing circulation costs in commerce remains poor.
    Each enterprise completing and overfulfilling the state-stipulated task of reducing costs, eliminating enterprise losses, and increasing its own profitability can seek out billions of new rubles to further improve the material and cultural well-being of the Soviet people.
    Reducing costs is one of the most important factors in increasing the Soviet national income, and has a direct impact on expanding both the socialist accumulation fund and the consumption fund; the socialist accumulation fund is the only source for expanding socialist reproduction. The constant growth of the accumulation fund enables the Soviet state to ensure the continuous growth and improvement of production on a high technical foundation and to carry out large-scale capital construction in all sectors of the national economy.
    From 1929 to 1952, the state's investment in capital construction in various sectors of the national economy amounted to 997 billion rubles in current rubles. As a result of this huge investment, heavy industry, which is the foundation of the socialist economy, has been established, the production of means of production has been greatly expanded, and light industry, the food industry, and agriculture have also achieved great success.
    On the basis of the booming heavy industry, all conditions and possibilities have been created to accelerate the development of light industry, the food industry, and agriculture, and to rapidly increase the production of the following consumer goods: meat, milk, fish, sugar, cloth, clothing, shoes, furniture, etc. For this purpose, investment in light industry, the food industry, and agriculture is being greatly increased.
    The increase in funds from cost reduction expands the Soviet national income, enabling Soviet society to steadily improve the living standards of the working people, constantly reduce prices, and increase expenditures on healthcare, education, and social insurance. For example, in the last budget year, the state's expenditures on education, healthcare, social and cultural measures, and pensions increased by 9.9 billion rubles, totaling 139.5 billion rubles.
    As a result of the five reductions in state retail prices from 1947 to 1952, the prices of food and industrial products were reduced by 50%. For example, the retail price of bread was reduced by 61%, meat by 58%, butter by 63%, and sugar by 51%. On April 1, 1953, the Soviet government implemented the sixth reduction in state retail prices, which actually covered all mass-consumed industrial products and food. The reduction in state retail prices in 1953, as well as the reduction in prices on collective farm markets and cooperative markets, provided the Soviet working people with benefits amounting to 53 billion rubles this year.
    Due to the reduction in the prices of mass consumer goods, the increase in the monetary wages of workers and staff, the increase in the in-kind income and monetary income of farmers, and the increase in various payments made by the state to residents, the welfare level of the Soviet people is constantly improving. In 1952, the average real income of workers and staff increased by 68% compared to 1940, and the average real income of farmers increased by 73% compared to 1940. The directives of the 19th Congress of the Party stipulated that during the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the real wages of workers and staff should be increased by at least 35% (including the reduction in retail prices), and the monetary income and in-kind income (calculated in cash) of collective farm members should be increased by at least 40%.
    The Soviet people are directly concerned about the increase in labor productivity and the reduction in costs. They know that doing so will consolidate the economic power of the Soviet Union and improve their own living standards. The lower the product costs and the higher the labor productivity, the more material resources socialist society can allocate to meet the needs of the working people.
    The following fact fully demonstrates the significance of reducing product costs in improving the material welfare of the working people: The employees of the Gubawen Fine Wool Fabric Factory started a struggle to save raw materials. In more than three years, they wove 313,000 meters of wool fabric with the wool accumulated from savings, which can be made into more than 100,000 coats and suits.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are carrying out a powerful socialist competition, striving to continuously increase labor productivity, master new technologies and adopt advanced technical operations, save raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity, improve the quality of products, eliminate losses in production, etc. During the post-war period, the rapid work method movement was widely promoted in various industrial sectors, and a struggle was launched to achieve the following goals: comprehensive saving of materials, production of products of excellent quality, striving for a high degree of production skills, overfulfilling accumulation plans, and better utilization of production capacity. The movement to reduce costs in every production operation has gained comprehensive development.
    Reducing costs is the most important factor in making the socialist economy stronger and more prosperous, and is the most important condition for continuously improving the material and cultural welfare of the people.

    降低成本怎样影响到劳动人民生活水平的提高
    苏联  莫·沃耳科夫
    “真理报”沿海边区诺沃—格奥尔吉耶夫克的读者弗·基立也科请求解答：降低产品成本对提高苏联人民福利有何意义？
    关怀人民的福利，是共产党活动的最高法则。党完全按社会主义基本经济法则的要求，不倦地为最大限度满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要而斗争。
    提高苏联人民的物质福利，是基于在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断的增长和完善。
    在生产的各个部门中降低成本和提高劳动生产率，对于苏联人民生活水平的提高，有着决定意义。社会主义经济中的成本是国营企业生产和销售产品所需花费的货币表现。成本是企业的全部生产活动在质量上最重要的指标。
    降低成本以提高劳动生产率，对原料、材料、燃料和电力的使用厉行节约为基础。正确使用机器和装备，生产组织合理化，加速资金流转，缩减行政管理费用具有重大的意义。在社会主义制度下，社会劳动的节约表现为产品成本的降低，它使社会可能在耗费同样多的劳动下来扩大生产的规模和社会的财富。苏联人民降低了成本，从而使社会生产进一步增长，扩大国民收入。苏联国民收入的增长，是社会主义社会财富和全国人民福利高涨的最鲜明的指标。
    降低成本的经济效果，与社会主义生产规模的扩大同时增长。在一九三一年，降低工业产品成本的百分之一，给积累提供一亿五千万卢布到二亿卢布，但到一九五○年，由降低工业产品成本的百分之一而节省的资金就超过了四十亿卢布。
    共产党第十九次代表大会关于第五个五年计划的指示，确定了更重大的降低工业产品成本的任务。整个说来，工业产品成本将降低百分之二十五左右，建筑工程成本至少要降低百分之二十，铁路运输成本降低百分之十五，农业机器站的拖拉机工作成本降低百分之二十五左右。完成降低成本的任务，将给国家提供巨额的节约资金，其规模可由下列数字看出：一九五一年因降低工业产品成本（批发价格的降低亦计算在内）而节省的资金是三百五十五亿卢布，到一九五二年，节约资金的数额就超过了四百六十亿卢布。可是，不能完成国家规定的降低成本计划的任务，国民经济便要遭到重大的损害。例如，一九五二年因一些工业企业不能赢利而发生的损失达一百六十亿卢布，这些卢布本来是可以用以扩大社会财富，提高劳动人民的生活水平的。
    正如苏联最高苏维埃第五届会议所指出，在采煤工业和林木工业中存在着许多亏本的企业，亏损数目极大。这些部门的许多企业经常毫无赢利，没有完成降低产品成本和提高劳动生产率的计划，对于财富资源和货币资源保管得不好。煤和木材的高额成本，对其他各种工业产品的成本起着不良的影响，也阻碍了大众消费品价格的降低。许多建筑组织和农业机器站，以及内河航运工作人员在争取降低成本方面，是不能令人满意的；商业中在降低流通费用方面的情形仍然不好。
    每一个企业完成和超额完成国家规定的降低成本、消灭企业亏损的任务，提高其本身的赢利性，就可以寻求出数十亿新的卢布，来进一步提高苏联人民的物质福利和文化水平。
    降低成本是提高苏联国民收入的一个最重要的因素，对扩大社会主义积累基金和消费基金都有着直接影响；社会主义积累基金是扩大社会主义再生产的唯一源泉。积累基金的经常增长，使苏维埃国家可能保证生产在高度技术基础上不断增长和完善，在国民经济的各部门中大规模地展开基本建设。
    从一九二九年到一九五二年，国家对国民经济各部门的基本建设的投资额，折合现在卢布达九千九百七十亿。由于这种巨额投资的结果，建立起了作为社会主义经济基础的重工业，大规模地扩大了生产资料的生产，轻工业、食品工业和农业也取得了很大的成就。
    在蓬勃发展的我国重工业的基础上，创造了全部条件和可能性来加速轻工业、食品工业和农业的发展，来迅速提高下列人民消费品的生产：肉类、牛奶、鱼类、糖类、布匹、服装、鞋子、家具等等。为了这个目的，轻工业、食品工业和农业的投资额正在大大地增加。
    由降低成本得来的资金的增长，扩大了苏联的国民收入，使苏维埃社会能够稳步提高劳动人民的生活水平，经常降低价格，增加保健、教育和社会保险等费用。例如，在上一个预算年度中，国家用于教育、保健、社会文化措施和抚恤金等方面的费用，就增加了九十九亿卢布，其总额达一千三百九十五亿卢布。
    由于自一九四七年到一九五二年五次减低国家零售价格的结果，粮食和工业品的价格降低了百分之五十，例如：面包的零售价格降低了百分之六十一，肉类降低了百分之五十八，牛油降低了百分之六十三，糖类降低了百分之五十一。一九五三年四月一日，苏联政府又实行了第六次降低国家零售价格，这次减价实际上遍及全部大众消费的工业品和食品。一九五三年国家零售价格的降低，以及集体农庄市场和合作社市场上价格的降低，给苏联劳动人民在本年中提供了数达五百三十亿卢布的利益。
    由于大众消费品价格的降低，工人和职员货币工资的增长，农民的实物收入和货币收入的增加，国家对居民各种付款的增大，苏联人民的福利水平正在不断地提高。一九五二年，工人和职员的实际收入的平均数，比一九四○年增加了百分之六十八，农民的实际收入比一九四○年平均增加了百分之七十三。党第十九次代表大会的指示规定了在第五个五年计划期间，工人和职员的实际工资至少要提高百分之三十五（零售价格的降低也计算在内），集体农庄庄员的货币收入和实物收入（以现金计算）至少要提高百分之四十。
    苏联人民直接关心劳动生产率的提高和成本的降低。他们知道，这样做就能巩固苏联的经济威力，提高他们自己的生活水平。产品成本降得愈低，劳动生产率提得愈高，社会主义社会为满足劳动人民的需要而能够拨出来的物质资源也就愈多。
    关于降低产品成本在提高劳动人民物质福利方面的意义，下面的事实即可充分表明：古巴温细呢制造厂职工开始了节约原料的斗争，在三年多的时间内，用节省积累下来的羊毛织成了三十一万三千公尺的呢料，可制十万多套大衣和西服。
    在共产党的领导下，苏联人民正开展着强大的社会主义竞赛，争取不断提高劳动生产率，精通新技术和采用先进的技术操作，节约原料、材料、燃料和电力，提高产品的质量，消灭生产中的损耗等等。战后时期中，各个工业部门都广泛地推行了快速工作法运动，开展了争取以下各项目的的斗争：综合节约材料，出产优良品质的产品，争取高度的生产技艺，超计划完成积累，更好地利用生产能力。在每一个生产作业中降低成本的运动，已获得了全面的发展。
    降低成本是社会主义经济更加强大高涨的最重要的因素，是不断提高人民的物质福利和文化水平的最重要的条件。
