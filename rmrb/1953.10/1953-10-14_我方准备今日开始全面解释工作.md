Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 13th—Due to the American side's continued use of all means to delay the construction of explanation facilities, the repeatedly postponed explanation work has not yet begun. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) has, for the third time on October 12th, demanded that the American side complete the construction of all explanation facilities by 9:00 AM on October 14th. The Korean-Chinese side also notified the NNRC on October 13th that the Korean-Chinese side is still prepared to commence full-scale explanation work on October 14th and is awaiting notification from the NNRC that the construction of all explanation facilities has been completed.

Note: The NNRC has twice firmly demanded that the American side complete the construction of all explanation facilities, including thirty-two permanent explanation tents, by 9:00 AM on October 14th, but both times the American side refused. The American side claimed that it could only erect twenty temporary explanation tents by October 11th. As for when the permanent explanation facilities could be completed, the American side either put forward an extremely unreasonable time estimate or used empty words such as "complete them as quickly as possible" to prevaricate. In order to remove all pretexts for the American side's delays and accelerate the commencement of full-scale explanation work, the Korean-Chinese side expressed its willingness to make concessions on October 11th, as long as the American side slightly expands the existing temporary explanation tents and erects thirty-two temporary explanation tents by 9:00 AM on October 14th, then the Korean-Chinese side would commence full-scale explanation work in the temporary explanation tents from October 14th. However, the American side surprisingly declared on October 12th that it had decided not to erect temporary explanation tents first, that the explanation tents it had already built were not temporary but permanent, that the number was not twenty but sixteen, and that the remaining sixteen would take another ten days to complete. Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho of the Korean-Chinese side pointed out in a letter to the NNRC on October 13th that the American side's refusal of the NNRC's demands and the Korean-Chinese side's concessionary proposal was completely unreasonable. It took away four of the twenty temporary explanation tents and instead called them sixteen permanent explanation tents, which is an insult to common sense. The Korean-Chinese side absolutely cannot agree to explanation work being deprived of one-half of its explanation rights from the very beginning, while the American side can conduct explanation work in all the facilities it requested. Explanation work, like all other issues of the Korean armistice, must be conducted on the basis of equal treatment. Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho also pointed out in the letter that the responsibility for delaying the explanation work lies entirely with the American side. The Korean-Chinese side opposes this delay. But no matter how long the American side delays the explanation work, the explanation period must be extended in accordance with the provisions of the Terms of Reference. The NNRC has an obligation to guarantee the representatives of the prisoners of war's home countries a ninety-day explanation period, and its decision in this regard is completely correct.

    我方准备今日开始全面解释工作
    【新华社开城十三日电】由于美方继续不择手段地拖延解释设备的修建，一再推迟的解释工作迄今尚未开始，中立国遣返委员会已于十月十二日第三度要求美方在十月十四日上午九时前修好全部解释设备，朝中方面亦已于十月十三日通知中立国遣返委员会：朝中方面仍准备在十月十四日开始全面的解释工作并正等待着中立国遣返委员会关于全部解释工作的设备业已修建完成的通知。
    按：中立国遣返委员会曾两度坚决要求美方于十月十四日上午九时前修好一切解释设备，包括三十二个永久性的解释帐篷，但均为美方所拒绝。美方声称它只能在十月十一日先搭好二十个临时性的解释帐篷，至于永久性的解释设备何时可修好，则美方或提出一极不合理的时间估计，或以所谓“尽可能快地修好”的空话相搪塞。为了解除美方一切拖延的藉口，加速全面解释工作的开始，朝中方面于十月十一日表示愿意让步，只要美方将已有的临时性解释帐篷略加扩充，在十月十四日上午九时前搭好三十二个临时性的解释帐篷，则朝中方面即将自十月十四日开始在临时性的解释帐篷中全面开始解释工作。但美方于十月十二日竟又宣称，它已决定不先搭临时性的解释帐篷，它所已修好的解释帐篷也不是临时性而是永久性的，数目不是二十个而是十六个，其余的十六个则须再花十天时间才能修好。朝中方面代表李相朝中将已在十月十三日给中立国遣返委员会的信中指出：美方拒绝中立国遣返委员会的要求和朝中方面的让步性建议，是完全没有道理的。它把二十个临时性的解释帐篷抽走四个，反而美其名为十六个永久性的解释帐篷，更是对于常识的一个讽刺，朝中方面绝不能同意解释工作一开始就被剥夺二分之一的解释权利，而美方却能在它所要求的全部设备中进行解释工作。解释工作，正如朝鲜停战的所有其它问题一样，必须在平等对待的基础上进行。李相朝中将在信中并指出：解释工作拖延的责任完全在于美方。朝中方面反对这种拖延。但不管美方将解释工作拖延至何时，解释期限必须按照职权范围的规定予以顺延。中立国遣返委员会有义务保证战俘所属国家代表有九十天的解释期限，该委员会就此所作的决定是完全正确的。
