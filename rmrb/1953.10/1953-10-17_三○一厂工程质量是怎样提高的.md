How the Engineering Quality of Factory 301 Was Improved
Zhang Mingjiu Xin Qiufeng

    I. The Idea of "Quality First" Is Deeply Rooted

    Since April this year, the construction site of Factory 301 under the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry has successively held exhibitions of defective products, exhibitions of ownerless products, symposiums, and cartoon exhibitions to educate the broad masses of workers about the principle of "a project of vital and lasting importance; quality first." In establishing the responsibility system, quality was emphasized. Criticisms were made, and practical education was carried out with vivid facts. At the same time, a quality inspection and technical management responsibility system was established. After this series of work, from leading cadres to the masses of workers, the idea of "quality first" began to take root. For example, the engineering quality of the Li Zenggui team in the furnace masonry team was relatively good. They adopted the slurry extrusion method and advanced operation methods to ensure quality in the masonry of refractory bricks. The leadership immediately held a conference to promote the advanced experience of the Li Zenggui team and incorporated the advanced operation methods into the operating procedures, fundamentally ensuring the quality of the lining project. Another example is that when surface pitting and exposed steel bars were found in a certain water pool project, the leadership immediately convened a meeting of concrete workers to investigate the reasons and find ways to ensure quality. In the past, concrete workers said, "The formwork is not made of glass. Who can know whether the quality inside is good or bad?" Now this kind of statement is no longer heard. When dismantling the concrete formwork, workers automatically run to see the quality of their own work. A certain squad leader, Sun Guofu, even said in his sleep, "We must ensure quality."

    II. No Construction Without Quality Standards and Operating Procedures

    One of the main reasons for the poor quality of Factory 301's engineering in the past was the lack of quality standards and operating procedures, leading to arbitrary construction. For example, in the manufacture and installation of a certain important project, the workers had never done such work before. There were neither quality standards nor operating procedures, yet construction began. During construction, they worked and reworked, and reworked and worked, repeating the process as many as six times, and the resulting work became a waste product. In recent months, quality standards and operating procedures have been formulated for important projects, and the result of implementing them is that not only is quality guaranteed, but also the progress is accelerated. For example, in the metal pivot frame installation project of a certain trough shell, quality standards and operating procedures were formulated and explained to the workers in detail. As a result, the installation increased from two units per shift per day to five units, the work efficiency increased by 1.5 times, and the quality was guaranteed. Now, it has become a system that no important project is allowed to be constructed without quality standards and operating procedures; and after the engineering task is issued, the workers ask for relevant technical data, and the workers do not construct without quality standards and operating procedures.

    III. Specialization of Labor, Dedicated Responsibility

    Implementing specialization of labor and dedicated responsibility is a fundamental method to strengthen construction technical management. The implementation of this method is to make each unit project responsible from beginning to end. For example, the civil construction installation of the unit project is the responsibility of the designated engineer, the sub-unit project is the responsibility of the designated technician, and professional work teams are organized during construction. The vertical air duct project is a double-row reinforced concrete project with a thickness of ten centimeters. At the beginning of construction, there was no dedicated person in charge, and the progress was slow. Later, a designated engineer was appointed, and the requirements for quality and progress and operating methods were formulated, and the cadres and workers were repeatedly briefed three times. The workers also came up with the "multi-rod multi-tamping method," which resulted in a seven-fold increase in work efficiency and no problems of pitted surfaces or honeycombing, ensuring quality.

    IV. Making a Sample

    The main projects of Factory 301 are very complex, and the quality requirements are very strict. This is work that veteran technicians have not done for many years, and technical personnel and workers have no construction experience. In order to ensure the quality of the project, the factory adopted the method of "trial production of samples," that is, making samples before the construction of important projects to gain construction experience. For example, the quality requirements for the furnace masonry project are very strict, and the workers have no confidence. Some said, "Isn't this just forcing us to make white flour steamed buns out of corn flour?" The furnace masonry team immediately organized workers to carry out trial masonry. Facts have proved that not only can the quality standards be met, but also the design requirements can be exceeded. During the trial production, the labor organization was rationally adjusted, and many operating tools were researched, such as mixing ash tools, brick selection tools, brick selection templates, and leveling devices. After three trough foundations were trial-produced, the workers believed that they could operate, and the furnace masonry project was officially started. This not only enhanced the confidence of the workers, but also prevented rework and waste.

    V. Based on Scientific Principles

    One of the reasons for the poor quality of the concrete project in the factory last year was the failure to establish scientific experimental work. At that time, the employees did not ask whether the cement met the standard and what the mixing ratio of the concrete was, and they arbitrarily constructed, resulting in serious quality accidents. This year, in February, a laboratory was established based on the suggestions of Soviet experts. When the experiment started, the workers did not pay much attention to it. After several cement tests, the workers received a great education. For example, the cement received for a concrete project on a certain foundation platform was produced in the winter of last year. After testing, it was found that the grade was not high enough to be used for important projects. Another example is that many of the stored cement was considered unqualified waste because of the long time since it was produced, but testing proved that many could be used in minor projects. Now, scientific testing has become a system. Raw materials, concrete mixing ratios, water-cement ratios, concrete strength, etc., must be tested. At the site, workers must ask, "Is there a test report?" when using materials. If not, the workers will not use it.

    VI. Listen to the Experts and Do as the Experts Say

    The Factory 301 project is designed according to the advanced technical standards of the Soviet Union. Many projects have not been seen by our technical personnel, so they cannot be constructed without the direct guidance of experts. For example, the furnace masonry team implemented a total of 28 expert suggestions in one month (which can be summarized as very complete quality standards and construction methods), which accelerated the progress and improved the quality. Another example is that in June, the concrete of seven equipment foundations in the Second Construction Site was cracked due to the expansion of the wooden boxes for the screw holes. Although the technical personnel and workers discussed it, they could not come to a conclusion. After the expert's analysis: "The dry board absorbs moisture and expands after pouring concrete"; therefore, "the wooden formwork must be placed in water before construction to be filled with water before use." Experience has proved that projects that seriously implement expert suggestions have achieved "good, fast, and economical" results, otherwise, the opposite results will be obtained. For example, the furnace masonry was carried out before the reaction furnace installation project obtained the acceptance certificate, which violated the expert's suggestion. During the acceptance, it was found that the furnace head shell was poorly made and needed to be repaired, resulting in all the masonry bricks being reworked, causing unnecessary losses. Now, the factory has a dedicated person in charge of implementing expert suggestions.

    VII. Layer-by-Layer Inspection

    Factory 301 has established and conscientiously implemented a layer-by-layer inspection system on the construction site. During construction, each project must be inspected by the team leader, group leader, technician, and construction worker, and finally inspected by the inspection section and the construction site representative of Party A, and a certificate of conformity is issued before the next process can be carried out. For example, when the Li Zenggui team of the furnace masonry team was carrying out the lining project, they checked the mortar joints once for every brick they laid, and checked the level once for every two or three bricks they laid. After laying a row and a layer, they comprehensively checked the level once, and then handed it over to the inspection section for inspection. This ensures that each brick is fully mortared and the mortar joints meet the quality requirements. In addition, the inspectors not only conduct final inspection and acceptance, but also go to the site to supervise the quality of sub-projects and assist the construction team and group leaders in implementing quality standards and operating procedures, which has played a positive role in ensuring the quality of the project.

    三○一厂工程质量是怎样提高的
    张鸣九　辛秋枫
    一、“质量第一”的思想深入人心
    中央重工业部三○一厂工地，从今年四月以来，陆续举办了废品展览会、无人负责展览会、座谈会、漫画展览等，向广大职工进行了“百年大计，质量第一”的教育。在建立责任制中，又以质量为重点，揭发批判，以生动的事实进行实际教育，同时建立了质量检查与技术管理责任制度。经过这一系列的工作，从领导干部到工人群众，开始树立了“质量第一”的思想。如砌炉队李增贵小组工程质量较好，在砌耐火砖中采用挤浆法及保证质量的先进操作法，领导上即召开大会推广李增贵小组的先进经验，并把先进操作法订到操作规程上去，使内衬工程从根本上保证了质量。又如某水池工程发现有麻面、露筋的毛病，领导上即召集混凝土工开会，查明原因，找出保证质量的办法。过去混凝土工说：“盒子板不是玻璃的，谁能知道里面质量好坏。”现在听不到这种说法了。在混凝土拆盒子板时，工人就自动地跑去看自己做的活的质量好坏。某班长孙国富在睡梦中还说：“一定要保证质量。”
    二、没有质量标准和操作规程就不施工
    三○一厂工程过去质量低劣，主要原因之一就是没有质量标准和操作规程，任意施工。如某重要工程的制做安装，工人们都没干过这样的活，既没有质量标准也没有操作规程，就这样开始施工了。在施工中，干了就返工，返了又干，反复达六次之多，结果做出的活成了废品。近几个月来，重要工程都制订了质量标准和操作规程，贯彻执行的结果，不但保证了质量，而且加速了进度。如某槽壳的金属枢架安装工程，制订了质量标准和操作规程，并向工人详细交代讲解，结果由每班每天安装二台增加到五台，工作效率提高了一点五倍，而且保证了质量。现在重要工程没有质量标准、操作规程就不准施工，已经成为制度；而工程任务下达后，工人就要有关技术等资料，没有质量标准和操作规程工人也不施工。
    三、专业分工，专人负责
    实行专业分工、专人负责，是加强施工技术管理的基本方法。实行这种办法，就是要使每一单位工程从头到尾都分工负责，如单位工程的土建安装有专责工程师负责，分部工程有专责技术员负责，施工中组织专业作业小组。竖风道工程是十公分厚的双排钢筋混凝土工程，开始施工时无专人负责，进度迟缓；后来确定了专责工程师，拟定了质量与进度的要求和操作方法，并反复三次向干部和工人进行交代，工人又想出了“多杆多捣法”，结果工作效率提高了七倍，没有发生麻面、蜂窝的毛病，保证了质量。
    四、做出样子
    三○一厂主要工程非常复杂，质量要求很严，这是多年老技工都没有干过的活，技术人员和工人都没有施工经验。该厂为了保证工程质量，采取了“试制样品”的办法，就是在重要工程施工前做出样品，取得施工经验。如砌炉工程质量要求很严格，工人都没有信心，有的说：“这不是硬叫拿玉米面做出白面馒头吗？”砌炉队当即组织工人进行试砌，事实证明不但能够达到质量标准，而且可以超过设计要求。在试制中合理地调整了劳动组织，并研究出很多操作工具，如拌灰工具、选砖器、选砖型板、铺平器等。试制了三个槽基础，工人都认为可以操作，砌炉工程才正式施工。这样，不仅增强了工人信心，而且防止了返工浪费。
    五、有科学根据
    该厂去年混凝土工程质量低劣的原因之一，就是没有建立科学试验工作。当时职工们不问水泥是否合乎标号和混凝土的配合比如何，就任意施工，结果造成严重质量事故。今年二月根据苏联专家建议，成立了化验室。开始作试验时工人不大理睬，经过几次水泥试验，给工人的教育很大。如某基础平台混凝土工程，领来的水泥是去年冬季的出品，经化验全不够标号，不能用于重要工程。又如库存水泥中很多因出厂时间长被认为是不合格的废品，但经化验证明有很多可以用在次要工程上。现在科学试验已成为制度，原材料、混凝土配合比、水灰比、混凝土强度等，都要经过化验。在现场上，工人使用材料时一定要问：“有试验单吗？”如果没有，工人就不用。
    六、听专家的话，按专家的话办事
    三○一厂工程是以苏联先进技术标准进行设计的，很多工程是我们技术人员没有看到过的，因此离开专家的直接指导就不能施工。如砌炉队在一个月中共贯彻了专家建议二十八件（归纳起来就是很完整的质量标准和施工方法），加速了进度，提高了质量。又如二工地在六月份有七个设备基础因螺丝孔木盒膨胀将混凝土挤裂了，虽经技术人员与工人讨论，也作不出结论。经专家分析：“是倒入混凝土后干板吸收水分而膨胀的”；因此“在施工前必须将木盒子板放置水中，灌饱了水再用”。经验证明，凡是认真贯彻专家建议的工程就做到了“好、快、省”，否则就得到相反的结果。如反应炉的安装工程未取得验收合格证之前就进行砌炉，违背了专家的建议。在验收时发现炉头外壳制作不良，需要修理，结果砌的砖全部返工，造成不应有的损失。现在该厂已有专人负责贯彻专家建议。
    七、层层检查
    三○一厂工地建立并认真贯彻了层层检查制度。在施工中，每项工程必须经过班、组长、技术员与施工员检查，最后由检查科和甲方工地代表检查，发给合格证后再进行下一道工序。如砌炉队李增贵小组在进行内衬工程时，每砌一块砖检查一次灰缝，砌两三块砖就检查一次水平，砌完一行及一层，全面检查水平各一次，然后再交给检查科检查。这样就保证了每块砖灰浆饱满，灰缝合乎质量要求。此外，检查员除进行竣工检查验收外，还到现场对分项工程进行质量监督，协助施工班、组长贯彻质量标准和操作规程，对保证工程质量起了积极的作用。
