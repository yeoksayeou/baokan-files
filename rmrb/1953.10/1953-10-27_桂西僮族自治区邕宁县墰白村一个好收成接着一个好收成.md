    One Good Harvest After Another in Tanbai Village, Yongning County, Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region
    A Zhuang reader, Wei Yuping, writes: It's the autumn harvest season, and I have returned to the place where my ethnic group, the Zhuang, live in compact communities—Tanbai Village, Yongning County, Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Guangxi Province. What appears before my eyes is a happy village with tidy houses and thriving crops. This can't be the same impoverished, desolate little village that was under Kuomintang reactionary rule four years ago, can it?
    The people of my hometown joyfully tell me about the happy life of the Zhuang people in the new China. Since liberation, Tanbai Village has had one good harvest after another. This year's crops are growing even better than last year's. The average yield of early rice for the entire village has increased by more than 10% compared to last year. Why have we had such a bumper harvest? My fellow villagers tell me: This is because Chairman Mao built the Xiyun River Water Conservancy Project near our village, which has freed tens of thousands of mu of fertile land from the threat of drought. This is because Chairman Mao has taught us to improve our production techniques. Most of the 107 households in the village now use salt water to select seeds. The old habit of not fertilizing late rice fields has also been completely changed. For example, Guo Yuanchang, the mutual aid team leader, applied more than 80 jin of fertilizer to his late rice fields, in addition to using base fertilizer and green manure. Of course, this is also because the Zhuang farmers in our hometown have raised their political awareness and production enthusiasm since liberation. One day, I was walking down a tidy alley when I found the village very quiet and it was hard to find anyone. A sixty-year-old uncle said to me:
    "It's not easy to find people during the day. Everyone is busy weeding and fertilizing. These days, everyone who can work is out in the fields." More and more women are also going to the fields to work. There was once this incident: On September 18th, when the sixth residential group in the village was holding a meeting, the work team comrades discovered that the farmers were arguing fiercely. Thinking that some dispute had arisen, they hurriedly ran over to mediate. Upon listening, they realized that the farmers were enthusiastically discussing where to establish the group's busy-season childcare center—this is already the second busy-season childcare center in the village.
    The lives of the Zhuang farmers in Tanbai Village have gradually improved with the bumper harvests. Before liberation, farmers drank thin rice porridge all day long; now they can often eat dry rice. Schools have also been established, and all the "big children" have been sent to school. The personal experiences of the farmers in Tanbai Village have made them deeply realize the greatness and correctness of Chairman Mao's brilliant ethnic policy. They often say: If you believe in what Chairman Mao says, you'll always be on the right path. This sentence precisely expresses their heartfelt trust and love for Chairman Mao.

### 桂西僮族自治区邕宁县墰白村一个好收成接着一个好收成

专栏：读者来信摘要

    桂西僮族自治区邕宁县墰白村一个好收成接着一个好收成
    僮族读者韦雨平来信：正当秋收的季节，我回到本民族聚居的地方——广西省桂西僮族自治区邕宁县墰白村。出现在我眼前的，是一个房屋整洁的、庄稼长得挺好的幸福农村。这不禁使我怀疑：难道这就是四年前国民党反动统治下那个贫困、荒凉的小村子？
    故乡的人们欢愉地告诉我新中国僮族人民的幸福生活。解放后，墰白村一个好收成接着一个好收成，今年的庄稼长得比去年更好，早糙全村平均比去年增产一成以上。为什么会有这样的丰收呢？乡亲们告诉我：这是因为毛主席在我们村附近修了一个西云江水利工程，使远近上万亩的良田不再受到旱灾的威胁。这是因为毛主席教导我们提高了生产技术，全村一百零七户人家现在大部分户已经采用了盐水选种；以往晚糙田不施肥的旧习惯也完全改变了，如互助组长郭元常在晚糙田中除了施基肥、绿肥外，还施了八十多斤肥田粉。当然，这也因为故乡的僮族农民解放后提高了政治觉悟和生产积极性。有一天，我在一条整洁的小巷上走着，村里静悄悄的很难找到人。一个六十多岁的老伯伯对我说：
    “白天找人可不容易，大家都在忙着除草、施肥。这年头，能够干活的人尽下地忙去了。”妇女们下地干活的也越来越多了。曾经有过这样一件事：九月十八日，村里第六居民小组开会时，工作组同志发现农民们争辩得很厉害，以为发生了什么纠纷，慌慌忙忙跑去劝解。一听，原来农民们正热烈地讨论应该在那块地方建立这个小组的农忙托儿所——这已是村里第二个农忙托儿所了。
    墰白村僮族农民的生活，随着丰收也逐步改善了。解放前，农民整天喝四眼稀米粥，现在能经常吃上干饭了。学校也办起来了，“大娃娃”全被送去上学了。墰白村农民的亲身体验，使他们深刻地认识了毛主席光辉的民族政策的伟大、正确。他们经常说：相信毛主席的话，走的净是好路。这句话，正表现了他们对毛主席衷心的信任和热爱。
