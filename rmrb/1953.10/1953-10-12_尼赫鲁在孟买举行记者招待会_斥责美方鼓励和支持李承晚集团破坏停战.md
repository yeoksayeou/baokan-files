Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: Bombay dispatch: Indian Prime Minister Nehru held a press conference on the 10th. At the meeting, Nehru said, "It seems they (South Korea) are deliberately trying to invalidate the armistice terms," and "Some members of the United Nations Command seem inclined to defend the Syngman Rhee government, and doing so encourages him."

Prime Minister Nehru denounced the activities of some "organizations" in the POW camps that threatened POWs to obstruct repatriation. He said that more than 100 POWs had secretly requested protection from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission because these organizations threatened them with force and death if they went to the commission. Nehru emphasized that preventing POWs from going to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is a violation of the spirit of the armistice agreement and the Geneva Convention. Nehru said, "Some people have opposed the commission visiting the POWs. We have been told that some POWs do not want to be visited. The United Nations General has also stated that these POWs should not be forced to listen to explanations. If this attitude is correct, then there is no need to send the commission at all, because they have already expressed their opinions."

Prime Minister Nehru pointed out that the main question that should be considered now is whether the activities of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission are being taken seriously.

Prime Minister Nehru said, "People have the suspicion that the South Korean government is trying in some way to make the commission unable to function during the ninety-day period, and then make the request that the ninety days have passed and there is nothing more to be done. This tactic was used even before the Indian troops went to Korea, when the South Korean authorities released more than 20,000 POWs in clear violation of the armistice agreement."

"If all the POWs are prompted to escape or are released in the same way, then there will be no question of POWs making a choice, and the whole arrangement will collapse. The South Korean government's attempt to cancel the armistice agreement is contrary to the guarantees provided by the United Nations Command. Therefore, it aroused my suspicion about delaying the construction of explanation facilities. If forty-one days are taken out of the prescribed ninety days to build the explanation facilities, and the ninety-day time limit is not extended, then only forty-nine days will be left to carry out the work. And this work cannot be completed within ninety days."

Prime Minister Nehru said, "Due to so many misunderstandings and confusions, the United Nations Command and the countries participating in this command should issue the clearest statements and give the clearest guarantees to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force. If the South Korean government continues its current threatening practices and the political conference cannot be held, we will be driven back to the state we were in before the armistice."

    斥责美方鼓励和支持李承晚集团破坏停战
    【新华社十一日讯】孟买消息：印度总理尼赫鲁十日举行记者招待会。尼赫鲁在会上说：“看来他们（南朝鲜）蓄意要使停战条款归于无效”，而“联合国军司令部的若干人员很有为李承晚政府辩解的倾向，这样做就鼓励了他”。
    尼赫鲁总理斥责战俘营中的一些“组织”威胁战俘以阻挠遣返的勾当。他说：已有一百多名战俘秘密向中立国遣返委员会要求保护，因为这些组织以武力和死亡威胁他们，如果他们要到委员会去的话。尼赫鲁强调：阻止战俘到中立国遣返委员会去，是违反停战协定和日内瓦公约的精神的。尼赫鲁说：“已有人反对委员会访问战俘。我们已经被告知，有些战俘不要被访问。联合国军的将军还表示：不应强迫这些战俘听解释。如果这种态度是正确的，那么就毫无必要派委员会去了，因为他们以前已表示过意见了。”
    尼赫鲁总理指出，现在应加考虑的主要问题是：中立国遣返委员会的各项活动是否被认真对待。
    尼赫鲁总理说：“人们有这样的猜疑：南朝鲜政府正在企图以某种方式在九十天的期间使委员会不能起作用，接着就提出这样的要求：九十天过去了，再没有什么可作的了。就是在印度部队前去朝鲜之前，这种策略已经被运用了，就是南朝鲜当局违反停战协定的明确规定，释放了两万多名战俘。”
    “如果用同样的方法促使所有的战俘逃跑或把他们释放，那么就不再有什么由战俘抉择的问题，而且整个安排就将垮台。南朝鲜政府取消停战协定的企图是和联合国军司令部所提供的保证相违背的。所以就引起我对拖延修建解释场所的猜疑。如果从规定的九十天中抽出四十一天来修建解释场所，而九十天的时限又不予延长，那么就只剩四十九天可以用来进行工作。而这种工作就是在九十天之内也做不完的。”
    尼赫鲁总理说：“由于已产生这样多的误解和混乱，以致于联军司令部及参加这个司令部的各国已应该就中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队发表最明确的声明和给予最明确的保证了。如果南朝鲜政府继续它目前的威胁作法，而且政治会议开不成的话，我们将被赶回停战以前所处的状态”。
