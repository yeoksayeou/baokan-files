    A Material Lesson in Wastefulness
    Wu Wei

    The materials section of the Bengbu Construction Engineering Company signed a contract this year with the Xuzhou Private Lime Kiln Joint Venture to purchase five million jin of lime. After the contract was signed, no one at the company paid any attention to it. When the lime was loaded onto the train cars, no one was sent to supervise the loading or check the specifications. After the lime arrived in Bengbu, the station notified them to pick it up, but they unloaded the lime onto a pile of stones and cinders at the station without weighing it. After a heavy rain, milky white lime slurry flowed everywhere. As a result, the lime on top weathered, and the lime underneath had to be filtered before it could be used. This resulted in a significant loss.

    Let's take a look at how the materials section disposed of this batch of lime! The Nangang construction site was nearing completion, so they delivered 80,000 jin of lime there. The construction site for the infectious disease hospital hadn't even erected its worker's quarters and didn't need lime at all, yet they delivered 100,000 jin there. The Fourth Middle School construction site had already informed the materials section that it wouldn't need lime in July, but they insisted on delivering 160,000 jin. This immediately alarmed the site director, who quickly called the materials section chief to negotiate. The chief ordered, in a commanding tone: "If too much lime arrives, you have to take it whether you want it or not!" Helpless, the construction site had to reluctantly accept it. The Unified Warehouse construction site couldn't start work because the address was changed, but 220,000 jin of lime was delivered. It sat there unused, and in the end, it had to be sold to other departments at an 20% discount. After this batch of lime was distributed to various construction sites, the materials section thought their task was complete and everything was fine. Little did they know that the lime on the construction sites, due to no one being responsible for it, completely weathered and deteriorated after several strong winds and heavy rains. Over 90% of the good lump lime turned into fine powder. According to statistics from five construction sites, a total of 130,000 jin of lime was lost. Calculated at 120 yuan per jin, including freight, this equals a loss of 15.6 million yuan. Even more seriously, the weathering, deterioration, and reduced adhesiveness of the lime severely affected the quality of the projects. Now, this batch of lime can no longer be used for plastering or bricklaying, and can only be used for the foundation.

    This situation isn't unique. Last year, they bought two train cars of gravel from Fuliji and forgot about it near the Xinfeng Flour Mill. It wasn't until June of this year, when the station urged them to move it, that they finally took it away. The Bengbu Winery project was completed more than two years ago, but as of July of this year, there were still 5,000 blue bricks and other materials piled up at the construction site. The Worker's Hospital construction site needed 25 cm lumber, but the materials section issued 26 cm lumber, so they had to adze off one centimeter. The Bengbu Normal School construction site already had enough blue bricks, but they blindly delivered 160,000 more bricks without asking, wasting more than 16 million yuan in freight for nothing. There's also this joke: At the end of 1952, Bengbu lacked bricks and tiles, so they sent people to Xuzhou to buy tens of thousands of foreign tiles. However, when they were inspected, they didn't check whether the quantity of goods purchased matched the quantity received. As a result, they forgot about one train car of foreign tiles (about 8,500 pieces, worth over 11 million yuan). This train car of tiles sat at the station for a long time without anyone claiming it. The station urged them to pick up the goods, but the section's transport worker replied, "We've already received all our tiles." This alarmed the station cadres, who posted advertisements everywhere in Bengbu looking for the owner. After a long time, no one responded. To free up the train car, the station had to sell the car of tiles to the construction company at a discounted price. Only then did the materials section wake up. After checking the figures and dates, they realized that this car of tiles was originally theirs. In the end, they had to pay a fine of more than 10 million yuan according to railway regulations.

    These facts show that the work of this materials section has become intolerably chaotic, and also shows how serious the phenomenon of no one being responsible is at the construction sites. Currently, it is extremely urgent and necessary to launch a mass movement against waste and to establish a responsibility system within the Bengbu Construction Engineering Company and its affiliated construction sites!

    一个浪费材料的材料课
    吴伟
    蚌埠市建筑工程公司材料课，今年和徐州私营石灰窑业联营社，订立了一个购买五百万斤石灰的合同。合同订后，公司就再没人过问了。装车的时候，不派人去监装和检查规格。石灰运到蚌埠后，车站通知他们起货，他们到车站没过磅，就把石灰卸在车站一块堆满石子、炭渣的地上。经过一场大雨，白乳般的灰浆到处乱流。这样一来，上面的石灰风化了，下面的石灰要过滤之后才能用。这损失是很大的。
    再看看，材料课怎样打发这批石灰吧！南岗工地快要完工了，他们给运去八万斤。传染病院工地工棚未搭，根本不需要石灰，他们也给运去十万斤。第四中学工地早已通知材料课七月份不需要石灰，但硬给运去十六万斤；这一下子可把工地主任急坏了，赶紧打电话和材料课长交涉，课长下命令似地说：“石灰来多了，你们不要也得要！”没办法，该工地只好勉强收下。统一仓库工地因更改地址未能开工，但运来二十二万斤石灰，摆着不用，结果只好八折卖给别的部门。这批石灰发落到各个工地之后，材料课便以为他们的任务已完，万事大吉。那知石灰在工地上同样因无人负责，经过数次大风、大雨，完全风化变质，好好的块子灰，百分之九十以上变成细末。现据五个工地的统计，共损失十三万斤石灰，每斤石灰加上运费按一百二十元计算，等于损失人民币一千五百六十万元。更严重的是由于石灰风化、变质、黏性减退，严重影响了工程质量。现在这批石灰已不能搪墙、砌墙，只能拿来打地根脚。
    这种情形并不只一次。去年他们从符离集买来两车皮石子，丢在信丰面粉厂附近忘记了。直到今年六月车站督催出站，才弄走。蚌埠酒厂工程已完工两年多了，直到今年七月工地上还堆着五千块青砖及其他材料。工人医院工地要二十五公分木料，材料课却发给二十六公分的，结果只好用锛砍去一公分。蚌埠师范工地青砖已够用了，他们没问一声，盲目地运去十六万块青砖，白白浪费运费一千六百多万元。还有这样一个笑话：一九五二年底蚌埠砖瓦缺乏，他们派人到徐州买回数万片洋瓦，但验收时没有核对一下购货量与收货量是否相等，结果忘掉一车皮洋瓦（约有八千五百片，价值一千一百余万元）。这一车洋瓦丢在车站好久没人来取，车站催他们起货，该课运输员回答说：“我们的瓦早已收完了。”这下子可忙坏了车站干部，他们在蚌埠到处张贴招领广告，隔了很长时间，仍然没有人理。车站为了腾出车皮，只好把这车洋瓦作价卖给建筑公司。一直到这时，材料课才睡醒，一查对数字、时间，才知道原来这一车洋瓦本来就是自己的。最后只好按照铁路规章罚款一千余万元。
    这些事实说明了这个材料课的工作已混乱到令人不能容忍的地步，也说明了工地上无人负责的现象是多么严重。目前，迅速在蚌埠市建筑工程公司内及其所属的工地上，开展群众性的反对浪费、建立责任制运动，是多么的迫切和需要啊！
