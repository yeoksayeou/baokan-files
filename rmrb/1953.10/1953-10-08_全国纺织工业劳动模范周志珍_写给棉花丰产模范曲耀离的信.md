National Textile Industry Labor Model Zhou Zhizhen
Write a Letter to Cotton Abundance Model Qu Yaoli

Dear Comrade Qu Yaoli:

I am a weaver at the Tianjin No. 3 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory and a member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. Since May 1950, I have not woven a single piece of substandard cloth (cloth with broken warps, broken wefts, holes, frayed edges, etc.). My average monthly output always exceeds the task, and I have not taken a single day off. Therefore, I was awarded the honorary title of National Textile Industry Labor Model at the Second Congress of the Textile Workers Union of China this year.

In the past, we have never met or corresponded, but I always feel that we are so close. I think the reason is simple: before liberation, I was a slave of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and you were a "beast of burden" of the feudal landlord class; after liberation, we have both become masters of the country, working happily in our own factories and on our own land. This shared destiny and change in political and economic status have linked the hearts of us workers and peasants. Our connection in production has deepened our friendship: you produce cotton, I produce cloth, you for me, I for you, and we both work together for the happy life of the people of the whole country.

Dear Comrade Qu Yaoli: Our own country has changed in every way since its founding four years ago. Last year, the period of national economic recovery ended; this year, a new period of national planned economic construction has begun. This makes us feel extremely excited! After several five-year construction plans, our country will achieve industrialization. At that time, we will use the latest machines to spin and weave, like the Soviet Union today, with one person watching hundreds of machines; you will also drive combines and tractors across the fields to cultivate crops. Needless to say, our lives will be even more beautiful and happy. But a beautiful socialist society will not come by itself, which requires us all to work together, work hard to produce, and successfully complete and strive to over fulfill the state's plan, to create conditions for the early realization of national industrialization. Now the Party calls on us to further develop the production increase and conservation campaign. The staff and workers in our factory have recognized the importance of increasing production and practicing economy. After the factory held a mobilization meeting on September 20, all workshops, groups, and individuals conducted in-depth research and formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy. Everyone has full confidence that, in addition to completing the state's original annual plan for this year, they will also increase production and conserve 10.7 billion yuan of wealth for the country. In other words, we want to produce more and better cloth for our peasant brothers and sisters and the people of the whole country.

The task is glorious, but also arduous. The comrades are now looking for tricks and digging potential to increase production and improve quality. What about myself? Although I have been over fulfilling the production task every month for the past three years and have not produced a single piece of substandard cloth, I have not yet reached the most ideal level in terms of output. I now manage ten looms alone. These ten looms are all running at the same time, and the amount of weft thread on the shuttles is almost the same, so they will all run out at the same time. Therefore, it is necessary to schedule the time for changing shuttles and checking the cloth surface evenly, so that people do not wait for the machines and the machines do not wait for the people, in order to weave more cloth and weave good cloth. This requires us to better master the "May 1st" weaving method. I am not yet proficient enough in implementing the "May 1st" weaving method, and sometimes my actions are not fast enough, and there is still a passive phenomenon in changing shuttles (i.e., the machines wait for people). I must, as Chairman Mao taught us, guard against arrogance and rashness, and humbly absorb the advantages of others in operation (for example, Comrade Ji Yurong in our workshop installs shuttles faster than I do) to improve my labor productivity. In that way, I can weave more than two zhang of cloth for the country every day, and I can weave more than twenty pieces of cloth for the country by the end of the year. At the same time, I want to help comrades who are technically poor and do not thoroughly implement the new working method, and work together to complete the factory's production increase and conservation plan. I have put forward four guarantees: (1) The average output of each machine per day should reach 36.6 yards (i.e., more than ten Chinese zhang of cloth), which is 0.76 yards more than the state quota (35.84 yards); (2) Maintain the past glory, carefully check the cloth surface, and do not produce a single piece of substandard cloth; (3) Guarantee 100% attendance, and do not miss a single shift; (4) Do not waste an inch of the country's thread, and do not waste a minute of production time.

Dear Comrade Qu Yaoli: The raw materials for our production depend on your supply. When we see cars of cotton being transported to the factory, we think of our peasant brothers and sisters, and we seem to see you and the brothers and sisters of your agricultural producers' cooperative working hard and happily in the cotton-blooming fields. In the People's Daily on October 1, we also saw your letter to Chairman Mao, and we learned that you have overcome seven disasters and eight difficulties this year and have won the possibility of a bumper harvest of cotton. Now the cotton is blooming white and big, with very few charred petals. This good news makes us very happy. Good cloth requires good cotton first. If we textile workers can get more good cotton, we will be more satisfied than anything else. We hope that the comrades of your cooperative and other cotton farmers will also do a good job in the harvesting and packaging of cotton, and do not mix inferior cotton such as charred petals, stiff petals, and frost-damaged flowers with other debris (such as stones, iron pieces, ropes, cloth scraps, etc.) and send them to the processing plant. Because if the quality of the cotton is not good, the yarn will not be easy to spin, the tensile strength of the yarn will not be high, and it will be easy to break, and the quality of the woven cloth will not be high, and it will also affect the output; if the cotton is mixed with debris, accidents will easily occur during processing and production. This not only hinders the completion of the state's production increase and conservation plan, but also directly endangers the clothing and use of our peasants and the broad masses of the people. In addition, we also hope that you must do a good job in selecting cotton seeds and bolls to ensure the continuous improvement of the quality of raw cotton in the future. In this way, we can jointly ensure the successful completion of the national construction plan and contribute our own strength in striving for our motherland to advance towards the great goal of socialist industrialization.

Comrade Qu Yaoli: We would like to know your cooperative's plan for increasing production and practicing economy and the specific measures to ensure the completion of the plan. I think your plan must be well-formulated, and everyone is working hard to implement it. I hope to receive your reply and hope that we can maintain regular contact.

### 全国纺织工业劳动模范周志珍  写给棉花丰产模范曲耀离的信

    先进生产者报告增产节约情况
    全国纺织工业劳动模范周志珍
    写给棉花丰产模范曲耀离的信亲爱的曲耀离同志：
    我是国营天津第三棉纺织厂的织布女工，是中国新民主主义青年团的团员。因为我从一九五零年五月到现在没有织过一匹次布（面上有断经、断纬、窟窿、破边等的布），每月平均产量总超额完成任务，也没有歇过一天工，所以在今年中国纺织工会第二次代表大会上，获得了全国纺织工业劳动模范的光荣称号。
    过去，咱们没有见过面，也没有通过信，可是我总感到我们之间是那样的亲近。我想这个道理很简单：在解放前我是官僚资产阶级的奴隶，你是封建地主阶级的“牛马”；解放后，咱们都成了国家的主人，在自己的工厂和土地上愉快地劳动着。这种共同的命运和政治经济地位的变化，把我们工人、农民的心连结到了一起。我们在生产中的联系，又加深了我们的一层情谊：你生产棉花，我生产布匹，你为了我，我为了你，咱们又共同为着全国人民的幸福生活。
    亲爱的曲耀离同志：咱们自己的国家，成立四年以来，一切都变了样。去年，国家经济恢复时期已经结束；今年，全国有计划的经济建设的新时期已经开始。这使我们感到无比的兴奋！经过几个五年建设计划，咱们的国家就会实现工业化了。那时候，我们要用最新式的机器纺纱织布，像苏联今天一样，一个人看他百八十台机器；你们也会驾驶着康拜因、拖拉机奔驰在田野里耕种庄稼。不用说，咱们的生活也会更加美满和幸福。可是美好的社会主义社会不会自己到来的，这就要求我们大家齐心合力，努力生产，胜利完成并争取超额完成国家的计划，为早日实现国家工业化创造条件。现在党号召我们进一步开展增产节约竞赛。我们厂里的职工都认清了增产节约的重要意义，在九月二十日厂里开了动员大会后，各个车间、小组和个人，都作了深入的研究，制订了增产节约计划。大家有充分的信心，除完成国家今年原定的年度计划外，还要给国家增产节约一百零七亿元的财富。换句话说，就是要给咱们农民兄弟与全国人民出产更多、更好的布匹。
    任务是光荣的，同时也是艰巨的。职工同志们现在都在找窍门、挖潜力，增加产量，提高质量。我自己呢？虽然三年来月月都能超额完成生产任务，并且没有出过一匹次布；可是在产量方面还没有达到最理想的地步。我现在一个人管十台织布机。这十台布机都是一齐开动的，梭子上的纬线缠的多少也差不离，要完就都完啦，所以，就必须把换梭子和查布面的时间都调度得匀匀称称的，做到人不等车，车也不等人，才能多织布和织好布。这要靠我们更好地掌握“五一”织布工作法才能办到。我现在执行“五一”织布工作法还不够熟练，有时候动作不够快，换梭子还有被动（即车子等人）现象。我一定要像毛主席教导我们的那样，戒骄戒躁，虚心地吸取别人在操作上的优点（像我们车间吉玉荣同志装梭子就比我快），提高自己的劳动生产率。那样，一天就能给国家多织二丈多布，到年底就能给国家多织二十来匹布。同时我要帮助技术差、对新工作法执行得不彻底的同志，共同为完成厂里的增产节约计划而努力。我提出了四项保证：（一）一台机器每天的平均产量要达到三十六点六码（即十市丈多布），比国家定额（三十五点八四码）多零点七六码；（二）保持以往的光荣，仔细检查布面，不出一匹次布；（三）保证百分之百的出勤率，一阵也不缺工；（四）不浪费国家的一寸线，不浪费一分钟的生产时间。
    亲爱的曲耀离同志：我们进行生产的原料是靠你们供给的。当我们看到一车车的棉花运到厂子里来的时候，就想到了农民兄弟，就好像看到你和你们农业生产合作社的兄弟姐妹们在棉花盛开的田地里辛勤、愉快的劳动情况。在十月一日的人民日报上，我们也看到了你写给毛主席的信，知道了你们今年战胜了七灾八难，争得了棉花丰收的可能，现在棉花开得又白又大，焦瓣很少。这个喜讯使我们万分高兴。织好布先要有好棉花。我们纺织工人如果能够得到更多的好棉花，那就比什么都要称心。希望你们的合作社的同志和其他棉农弟兄们还要作好棉花的收获和包装工作，不要把带焦瓣、僵瓣、霜后花等劣质棉花与其它杂物（如石块、铁件、绳子、布块等）混在棉花里送到加工场去。因为倘若棉花的质量不好，纱就不好纺，纱的拉力也不大，容易断头，织出来的布质量也就不高，同时也会影响产量；如果棉花里混有杂物，加工生产时就容易发生事故。这不仅对完成国家增产节约计划有妨碍，而且也直接危害到咱们农民和广大人民群众的衣着穿用。此外，还希望你们一定要作好棉籽铃选工作，以保证今后原棉质量的不断提高。这样咱们就能共同保证国家建设计划的胜利完成，在争取我们祖国向社会主义工业化的远大目标迈进中贡献我们自己的力量。
    曲耀离同志：我们愿意知道你们合作社的增产节约计划和保证完成计划的具体办法。我想你们的计划一定订得很好，并且大伙都正在努力实行。希望得到你的回信，并希望我们保持经常的联系。
