    Health and Medical Work Developed in Tibetan Inhabited Areas of Southern Gansu

    Significant progress has been made in medical and health work in the Tibetan-populated areas of southern Gansu Province. In this region, three hospitals, fourteen health clinics, and six health stations have been established. Health clinics and maternal and child health stations are also being established in pastoral areas bordering Qinghai and Sichuan. Currently, each hospital is equipped with facilities for bacteriological testing and simple surgeries. The Xiahe County Hospital also has spacious wards.

    According to statistics from the Zhuoni and Lintan County Hospitals, over 32,000 patients have been treated in the past eight months. Each health clinic treats an average of over 100 people per month. All 29 delivery stations in the region have safely delivered over 440 babies.

    This year, the county hospitals, in conjunction with the Gansu Provincial Ethnic Medical Team, organized four medical teams to conduct mobile treatments in pastoral areas. In addition to general prevention and control work, they provided effective treatment for patients suffering from local endemic diseases such as venereal diseases and goiters. Over the past six months, county hospitals and medical teams have cured over 10,000 patients with these conditions. Whenever a medical team arrives in a place, the Tibetan people first clean their houses and warmly welcome the medical team. When the team leaves, they are reluctant to part and lead horses to see them off.

      Southwest Military Region Performing Arts Troupe Sends Work Team to Perform on Yunnan Border

    The Performing Arts Troupe of the Political Department of the Southwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army sent a work team to perform on the Yunnan border to慰问(console) the soldiers defending the peaceful construction of the motherland. The team walked more than 2,500 li in five months and performed more than 50 shows.

    The actors often walked long distances to perform for soldiers stationed in remote areas. In addition to performing, the comrades of the performing arts troupe also paid attention to helping the troops carry out cultural and recreational activities, teaching soldiers to sing and dance, and helping soldiers revise their works. During the慰问(consolation) performances, they paid close attention to learning from the soldiers. In a few months, they learned many dances and songs such as "Tuopi Dance" and "Small Cart Dance" from the soldiers.

    The troupe was warmly welcomed by the soldiers wherever it went. The慰问(consolation) performances of the performing arts troupe greatly encouraged the soldiers. When they left the various companies, many companies or soldiers voluntarily wrote letters to Commander He Long of the Southwest Military Region, expressing their determination to increase vigilance, defend the border of the motherland, and protect the safety of the motherland.
