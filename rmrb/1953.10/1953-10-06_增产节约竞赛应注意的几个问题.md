Since the past month, the campaign to increase production and practice economy, aimed at exceeding the national plan, has begun to unfold. Under the personal leadership of responsible comrades, various regions and departments have discussed and conveyed the central government's call, and based on the specific circumstances of their respective regions and departments, have put forward specific plans for increasing production and practicing economy, as well as necessary measures. Some regions and central financial departments have already disseminated their plans to grassroots units; some regions and departments have also organized work groups to supervise and assist their subordinate units in rapidly launching the work; some factories, mines, and enterprises have widely launched the competition for increasing production and practicing economy among the masses. Cadres at all levels and the broad masses have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and a revolutionary spirit of overcoming difficulties in discussing and implementing the plans for increasing production and practicing economy stipulated by the higher authorities, and are confidently using practical actions to complete their tasks. Obviously, this high degree of enthusiasm and spirit of overcoming difficulties is a decisive driving force for ensuring the overfulfillment of the state's 1953 plan.

Comrade Stalin once said in "New Situation and New Tasks of Economic Construction": "The reality of our production plans is the living people, it is ourselves, our will to work, our determination to work in new ways, our determination to implement the plans. Do we have this determination? Yes, we have this determination. Therefore, our production plans are possible and should be realized." Now, our cadres at all levels and the working people, just as Comrade Stalin said, have the determination to complete the state plan. Then, our plan must be possible and should be realized, and further advance our financial and economic work.

However, on the other hand, judging from the national situation, the increase production and practice economy movement has only just begun to be launched, and some regions or departments are still only at the stage of conveying and deploying. In order to develop this movement and deepen it, we must continue to work hard, quickly formulate specific plans, conduct in-depth communication and mobilization among the masses, and transform the increase production and practice economy plans of various regions and departments into practical actions of the broad masses. Therefore, all regions and departments that have formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy and have disseminated the plans to grassroots units should immediately organize forces to help grassroots units healthily launch the competition for increasing production and practicing economy, and should especially pay attention to helping those important enterprises and units that were originally weaker in their work. All regions and departments that have initially formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy but have not yet disseminated the plans should quickly deploy the plans to grassroots units, put forward specific requirements for their subordinate units, and conduct in-depth propaganda and mobilization among the masses, so that every staff member and worker in the enterprise can understand the great significance of increasing production and practicing economy for the country's current and future construction cause, thereby actively taking action, tapping potential, finding tricks, putting forward rationalization proposals, learning and promoting advanced experience, and completing and overfulfilling the increase production and practice economy plan on the basis of ensuring the completion of the 1953 national plan. Those who have not yet formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy should immediately, based on the specific circumstances of their own units, tap active factors and favorable conditions, calculate possibilities, determine the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, report to the higher leading organs, and at the same time quickly deploy it.

Based on the past experience of the increase production and practice economy movement, as well as the problems currently discovered in the increase production and practice economy movement, there are several issues that should be given universal attention when widely launching and deepening the increase production and practice economy movement.

First, the increase production and practice economy in enterprises must be combined with improving enterprise management. When mobilizing and organizing the masses to tap potential, find tricks, and launch labor competitions, we must pay attention not to disrupt the original work arrangements, but should further improve the level of enterprise management and improve enterprise operation and management on the basis of the original work arrangements. The state requires every enterprise not only to increase the quantity of products, but also to ensure that it improves quality and reduces costs, that is, to comprehensively overfulfill the national plan. Therefore, we cannot simply and rashly use the method of working overtime and launching crash production to carry out the increase production and practice economy movement, but should start from strengthening management work, that is, from establishing and improving plan management, technical management, various responsibility systems, and economic accounting systems, organizing balanced production, improving product quality, reducing and even eliminating waste products and defective products, rationally using raw materials, rationally organizing labor, consolidating labor discipline, reducing and even eliminating accidents, etc., in order to achieve the purpose of increasing production and practicing economy. It must be recognized that if the increase production and practice economy movement is not combined with improving enterprise operation and management, there will be deviations such as spontaneous flow and disruption of production arrangements, and it will never be possible to truly achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy, and may even cause waste (such as increased waste products, equipment damage, backlog of parts, etc.), which must be prevented. The method of combining increase production and practice economy with improving enterprise management is to, on the basis of improving the ideological awareness of employees, lead the masses to check and summarize the implementation of the plan in the past few months, discover problems, find potential, and then formulate a plan for increasing production and practicing economy and corresponding technical measures plan based on the requirements of the higher authorities and the possible conditions of the enterprise. After the plan for increasing production and practicing economy is determined, in factories and mines that are implementing operation plans, the plan for increasing production and practicing economy should be incorporated into the operation plan, and a competition for increasing production and practicing economy centered on completing the operation plan should be launched. In this way, completing the operation plan will not only complete the state's original plan, but also complete the plan for increasing production and practicing economy. In factories and mines centered on improving product quality and strengthening technical management, a plan to improve product quality should be formulated, and technical standards and operating procedures should be revised and improved based on the rationalization proposals put forward by the masses, so as to achieve the purpose of effectively improving and improving product quality. Increasing production and practicing economy and improving enterprise management are not contradictory, on the contrary, they are completely consistent. The view and practice of opposing the two are incorrect.

Second, when formulating plans for increasing production and practicing economy, we must pay attention to the balance of supply, production, and sales, strengthen planning, and prevent the phenomenon of blindly increasing production without considering the supply of raw materials, the sales of products, and internal balance. Because the result of such blind increase in production will not only not increase the country's wealth, but will waste the country's wealth. Products for which raw materials and sales problems can be solved locally can be increased after the local area calculates the balance; for major products whose raw materials need to be allocated by the central government or whose sales involve the whole country, a report should be submitted to the relevant departments of the central government for consideration and approval before determining whether to increase production and how much to increase. At the same time, all localities and departments should strengthen the supply of raw materials, try to solve the difficulties of raw materials by themselves as much as possible, and pay attention to the conservation and proper storage of raw materials to prepare for next year's production; strive to strengthen the sales of goods to avoid product backlog, so as to complete the financial and profit payment plans. In this regard, commercial departments and material allocation departments should take the initiative to actively cooperate.

Third, in terms of basic construction, the investment in those secondary projects that should be postponed or reduced should be postponed and reduced to reduce the country's expenditure, ensure that major projects and construction projects that are decisive for increasing production next year can be completed according to plan, and ensure the quality of all construction projects. This is the biggest increase production and practice economy in basic construction. To this end, all departments and regions should distinguish between major and minor engineering projects, study various conditions, rank them one by one, review them one by one, and for all those that are necessary and can be completed, they should make the greatest efforts to ensure their quality standards and timely completion; for projects that have entered a tense stage of construction, they should not be stopped rashly to avoid waste. At the same time, all departments and regions should implement the responsibility system in construction and installation enterprises, oppose waste, initially establish an economic accounting system, and reduce construction and installation costs from the aspects of saving raw materials, rationally organizing labor, and promoting advanced construction experience and advanced technology, so as to save funds for the country. Construction has now entered the final stage, and leading departments at all levels and all basic construction workers should give full play to their enthusiasm, strive to basically complete this year's revised basic construction plan, and make the necessary preparations for next year's basic construction.

Fourth, private industrial and mining enterprises should also carry out the increase production and practice economy movement under possible conditions, improve the operation and management of enterprises, increase production, improve product quality, and reduce costs. This is beneficial to meeting the needs of the country and the people and to the private enterprises themselves. However, the increase in production of private enterprises should pay more attention to the source of raw materials and the sales of products, prevent blind spontaneous flow, and at the same time prevent some capitalists from using the increase production and practice economy as an excuse to harm the interests of the working class.

Fifth, it is necessary to seize the tax collection work. A large amount of national industrial and commercial tax needs to be collected during the commercial peak season in the fourth quarter, which is a very heavy task. In order to complete this year's tax revenue task, governments and financial departments at all levels must strengthen their leadership over tax collection work, have a good understanding and grasp of the economic situation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, make proper arrangements for the amount of various taxes and the collection time, properly carry out the struggle against tax evasion and leakage according to policies and laws, and take effective measures to prevent tax evasion and leakage, so as to confidently collect all taxes that should be collected as much as possible before the end of the year according to tax rates and actual possibilities.

Sixth, leadership over rural autumn harvest work should be seized to increase the harvest of grain and cotton; after the autumn harvest, farmers should be organized to prepare for next year's production.

There are only three months left before the end of the year. Leading organs at all levels must seize the time and, according to the central government's call and the specific requirements of the higher authorities, universally and deeply launch the increase production and practice economy in all places. It should be fully recognized that the purpose of seizing the increase production and practice economy is not only to increase income, but also to enable leading cadres at all levels to specifically familiarize themselves with financial and economic work, especially industrial production and basic construction work, and to specifically tap potential capabilities through this movement, so as to improve our work in all aspects of finance and economy, improve leadership levels, and promote the progress of future construction undertakings. To this end, all regions, departments, and leading organs at all levels must personally grasp this movement by responsible comrades, widely mobilize the masses, and organize cadres to go deep into the grassroots to carry out deployment and inspection, specifically and promptly solve problems, and deeply and specifically implement the call for increasing production and practicing economy, so as to become a movement of the broad masses. We must complete and overfulfill the increase production and practice economy plan on the basis of ensuring the completion of the national plan, and lay a good foundation for the work in 1954.

    增产节约竞赛应注意的几个问题
    近月以来，以超额完成国家计划为目标的增产节约竞赛运动，已初步开展起来。各个地区、各个部门在负责同志亲自领导下，讨论和传达了中央的号召，并根据本地区、本部门的具体情况，提出了具体的增产节约的计划和必要的措施。一部分地区及中央财经部门已将自己的计划下达到基层单位；有的地区和部门并组织了工作组，督促和帮助所属单位迅速展开工作；有一部分工厂、矿山及企业单位，已在群众中广泛开展了增产节约的竞赛。各级干部和广大群众对于上级所规定的增产节约计划的讨论和执行，表现了高度的积极性和克服困难的革命精神，满怀信心地以实际行动来完成自己的任务。显然，这种高度的积极性和克服困难的精神，是保证超额完成国家一九五三年计划的一个具有决定意义的推动力量。
    斯大林同志在“新的环境和新的经济建设任务”中曾经说过：“我们的生产计划底实在性，就是活的人，就是我们自己，我们的劳动意志，我们按新方法工作的决心，我们执行计划的决心。我们有这种决心么？是的，有这种决心。所以，我们的生产计划也就是可能而且应当实现的。”现在我们各级干部和劳动人民正是像斯大林同志所说的那样，有着完成国家计划的决心，那么，我们的计划也就一定可能而且应当实现，并使我们的财政经济工作向前推进一步。
    但另一方面，从全国情况看来，增产节约运动还仅仅开始在发动，有的地区或部门还只停留在传达布置的阶段。为了使这一运动开展起来和深入下去，必须继续努力，迅速地制定具体计划，在群众中作深入的传达和动员，使各地区各部门增产节约计划变成广大群众的实际行动。因此，凡是已经制定了增产节约计划，并将计划下达到基层单位的地区和部门，应即组织力量，帮助基层单位健康地展开增产节约竞赛，特别应注意帮助那些重要的企业和原来工作较薄弱的单位。凡是已经初步制定增产节约计划但计划尚未下达的地区和部门，就应迅速将计划布置到基层单位，对所属单位提出具体的要求，并在群众中作深入的宣传动员，使每个工作人员和企业中的职工，都能懂得增产节约对于国家当前和今后建设事业的重大意义，从而积极行动起来，挖掘潜力，寻找窍门，提出合理化建议，学习和推广先进经验，在保证完成一九五三年国家计划的基础上，再完成和超额完成增产节约计划。凡是尚未制定增产节约计划的，应即根据本单位具体的情况，挖掘积极的因素和有利的条件，计算可能，确定增产节约的计划，报告上级领导机关，同时迅速布置下去。
    根据过去增产节约运动的经验，以及目前在增产节约运动中所发现的问题，在广泛地开展和深入增产节约运动的时候，有几个问题是应该引起普遍注意的。
    第一，企业中的增产节约必须和改善企业管理工作相结合。在发动和组织群众挖掘潜力、寻找窍门、开展劳动竞赛时，必须注意不要打乱了原来的工作部署，而应在原来工作部署的基础之上，进一步提高企业管理水平和改善企业经营管理工作。国家要求各个企业不仅增加产品数量，而且必须保证提高质量，降低成本，即全面地超额完成国家计划。因此，就不能简单地草率地用加班加点、突击生产的办法去开展增产节约运动，而应从加强管理工作入手，即从建立和健全计划管理、技术管理、各种责任制度及经济核算制入手，组织均衡生产，提高产品质量，减少以至消灭废品和次品，合理地使用原材料，合理地组织劳动力，巩固劳动纪律，减少以至消灭事故等，以此达到增产和节约的目的。必须认识，如果增产节约运动不和改善企业经营管理工作相结合，就会发生自流现象和打乱生
  产部署的偏差，也就决不能真正达到增产节约的目
  的，甚至反而会造成浪费（如废品增加，设备损
  坏，部件积压等等），这是必须注意防止的。增产
  节约和改善企业管理相结合的方法，就是要在提高
  职工思想觉悟的基础上，有领导地发动群众检查和
  总结过去几个月的计划执行情况，发现问题，找出潜力，然后根据上级要求和企业的可能条件，制定出增产节约计划和相应的技术措施计划。增产节约计划定出后，在正在推行作业计划的厂矿中，就要把增产节约计划纳入作业计划中去，开展以完成作业计划为中心的增产节约竞赛。这样，完成了作业计划，就不但完成了国家原定的计划，而且又完成了增产节约的计划。在以改善产品质量、加强技术管理为中心的厂矿中，要订出提高产品质量的计划，根据群众提出来的合理化建议，修改和提高技术标准和操作规程，达到切实改善和提高产品质量的目的。增产节约和改善企业管理并不是矛盾的，相反，正是完全一致的。那种把两者对立起来的看法和作法都是不正确的。
    第二，在制订增产节约计划时，必须注意供、产、销的平衡，加强计划性，防止不考虑原材料供应、产品销路以及内部平衡而盲目地增产的现象。因为这样盲目增产的结果，不但不能增加国家财富，反而浪费国家财富。凡是确实在本地区内可以解决原材料和销路问题的产品，可由本地区计算平衡后决定增产；凡原材料须由中央调拨或销路涉及全国的主要产品，则应报请中央有关部门考虑批准后再确定是否增产及增产多少。同时，各地各部门应加强原材料的供应工作，尽可能自己解决原材料的困难，并注意原材料的节约和适当储存，为下一年度的生产作好准备；努力加强商品推销工作，避免产品积压，以完成财务和上缴利润的计划。对此，商业部门和物资调拨部门应主动地大力配合。
    第三，在基本建设方面，应该推迟和削减那些应推迟或削减的次要项目的投资，以减少国家的开支，保证主要工程项目和对明年增加生产有决定意义的建设项目能按计划完成，并保证所有施工工程的质量。这是基本建设方面最大的增产节约。为此，各部门和各地区应把工程项目分别主次，研究各种条件，逐一排队，逐一审查，对一切必需和可能完成的，则应尽最大努力保证其质量标准和及时完成；对于施工已进入紧张阶段的项目，不应草率停工，以免造成浪费。同时，各部门各地区在建筑安装企业中，应贯彻责任制度，反对浪费，初步建立经济核算制度，从节约原材料、合理组织劳动、推广先进的施工经验和先进技术等方面，降低建筑安装成本，为国家节约资金。现在施工已进入最后阶段，各级领导部门和全体基本建设的职工，应发挥高度的积极性，努力争取基本上完成今年修改后的基本建设计划，并为明年的基本建设做好必要的准备工作。
    第四，私营工矿企业在可能的条件下，也应同样开展增产节约运动，改善企业的经营管理工作，增加生产，提高产品质量，降低成本。这对满足国家和人民的需要和对私营企业本身都是有利的。但是，私营企业的增产，更应注意原材料来源和产品销路，防止盲目自流，同时应防止某些资本家以增产节约为藉口，损害工人阶级利益的行为。
    第五，必须抓紧税收工作。全国工商税中有很大一个数量要在第四季度商业旺季时征收，这是很繁重的任务。为了完成今年的税收任务，各级政府及财政部门必须加强对税收工作的领导，很好地了解和掌握私营工商业的经济情况，对各种税收的数量及征收时间应作妥善安排，根据政策法令，恰当地开展反偷漏斗争，采取有效措施，防止偷税漏税，以便有把握地按照税率和实际可能，把一切应收的税尽量在年前收起来。
    第六，对于农村秋收工作应抓紧领导，以增加粮食和棉花的收获量；在秋收之后，应组织农民为明年生产做好准备工作。
    现在离年终只有三个月了，各级领导机关必须抓紧时间，根据中央号召和上级的具体要求，把增产节约在所有的地方普遍深入展开。应充分认识，抓紧增产节约的目的，决不仅仅是为了增加收入，同时还在于通过这一运动，使各级领导干部具体熟悉财政经济工作，特别是工业生产和基本建设工作，具体挖掘潜在能力，以改进我们财政经济各方面的工作，提高领导水平，推动今后的建设事业的前进。为此，各地区各部门和各级领导机关，必须由负责同志亲自掌握这一运动，广泛发动群众，并组织干部深入基层，进行布置和检查，具体地及时地解决问题，使增产节约的号召，深入地具体地贯彻下去，成为广大群众的运动。我们要在保证完成国家计划的基础上，完成和超额完成增产节约计划，并为一九五四年的工作打下良好的基础。
