    The Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, based on the resolutions of the National Higher Industrial School Administrative Conference, convened a national symposium on key revisions of teaching plans for higher industrial schools in Shanghai from September 23rd to 27th, to learn from advanced Soviet experience and better integrate with China's reality, with a focus on formulating unified teaching plans. Participants included 53 individuals such as academic affairs directors, department heads, teaching and research office directors, and professors from 18 institutions including Dalian Institute of Technology, Tianjin University, Jiaotong University, Tongji University, Wuhan University Hydraulic Engineering College, Chongqing Civil Engineering and Architectural College, and Northwest Institute of Technology. The Ministries of Fuel Industry, Construction Engineering, First Machine Building Industry, and Water Resources also sent engineers and technical cadres to participate. Soviet experts Gusmin, Sadovichi, and Dementiev also attended and provided guidance.
    The symposium considered that in order to enable the talents cultivated by various higher industrial schools to meet the standards required by national construction, each major should revise a unified teaching plan suitable for general levels. The participants were divided into groups according to majors, and with the specific assistance of Soviet experts, studied the teaching plans of key majors in the departments of machinery, civil engineering and architecture, electrical engineering, and water conservancy based on Soviet experience combined with China's actual situation. They further clarified the training objectives of each major, rearranged the teaching progress schedule and the teaching progress plan, and appropriately increased, decreased, and merged certain courses. After in-depth research, each group separately revised unified teaching plan drafts for five undergraduate majors: Mechanical Manufacturing Engineering, Power Plant Distribution Network and Combined Transmission System, River Structures and Hydraulic Structures of Hydropower Stations, Industrial and Civil Buildings, Industrial and Civil Building Structures; and two specialized programs: Metal Cutting Processing, Industrial and Civil Buildings. If each school conducts teaching based on these teaching plan drafts and completes them diligently, students will become scientific and technical personnel with the equivalent of engineers and senior technicians after graduation. With the increase or decrease of courses, the total study hours for the entire course: undergraduate is controlled at around 3,800 hours, and specialized programs are about 2,000 hours. The symposium also initially exchanged views on the important key to implementing a unified teaching plan, namely how to revise the teaching syllabus for the first and second-year courses of each major. Several schools participating in the electrical engineering group will regularly formulate or revise the teaching syllabus for this major.
    At the symposium, Soviet experts Gusmin and Sadovichi made reports on revising the unified teaching plan, and Dementiev made a report on revising the teaching syllabus, which gave great help to the symposium.
    Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, spoke at the meeting. He emphasized the significance of today's Chinese higher industrial schools revising the unified teaching plans for various majors. He said: In the future, the students trained by various schools will be transferred to modern industrial positions, and a unified teaching plan can ensure the training of qualified industrial technical personnel. This is a major event for national construction. He said: These seven unified teaching plan drafts will be implemented on a trial basis starting from the first grade of 1953 after being approved by the Central Ministry of Higher Education. He pointed out that the unified teaching plan is the direction of effort for each school, but it does not require each school to immediately implement it all according to this plan. Each school can gradually achieve full implementation according to its different conditions. For the teaching plans of other undergraduate majors, each school can appropriately revise them according to the spirit of the National Higher Industrial School Administrative Conference and the practical experience of this symposium.

    中央人民政府高等教育部
    召开高等工业学校修订教学计划座谈会
    确定了机械制造工学等七个专业的统一教学计划草案
    中央人民政府高等教育部根据全国高等工业学校行政会议的决议，为了学习苏联先进经验更好地结合中国实际，重点制订统一的教学计划，九月二十三日到二十七日在上海召开了全国高等工业学校重点修订教学计划座谈会。参加座谈会的有大连工学院、天津大学、交通大学、同济大学、武汉大学水利学院、重庆土木建筑学院、西北工学院等十八个院校的教务长、系主任、教研室主任、教授等共五十三人。中央人民政府燃料工业部、建筑工程部、第一机械工业部和水利部也派工程师、技术干部多人参加。苏联专家顾思明、萨多维奇、杰门节夫也到会指导。
    座谈会认为要使各高等工业学校培养的人材能达到国家建设所要求的标准，各专业就应该修订一个统一的，适合一般水平的教学计划。参加座谈会的人员按专业分成小组，在苏联专家具体帮助下，根据苏联经验结合中国实际情况研究了机械、土木建筑、电机、水利各系重点专业的教学计划，进一步明确了各专业的培养目标，重新安排了教学进程表和教学进程计划，并适当地增减及合并了某些课程。各组经过深入研究分别修订机械制造工学、发电厂配电网及联合输电系统、河川结构与水电站的水工建筑、工业与民用建筑、工业与民用建筑结构五个本科专业和金属切削加工、工业与民用建筑两个专修科专业的统一的教学计划草案。各校如根据这些教学计划草案进行教学并认真地完成，学生毕业后就能成为具有相当于工程师和较高级技术员的科学技术水平。随着课程的增减，全学程的学时：本科控制在三千八百小时左右，专修科约二千小时。座谈会对于执行统一的教学计划中的重要关键，即如何修订各专业一、二年级课程的教学大纲，也初步地交换了意见。参加电机小组的几个学校将定期制订或修订完成本专业的教学大纲。
    在座谈会上，苏联专家顾思明、萨多维奇作了关于修订统一的教学计划的报告，杰门节夫作了关于修订教学大纲的报告，给座谈会很大的帮助。
    中央人民政府高等教育部副部长曾昭抡在会上讲话。他着重指出今天中国的高等工业学校修订各专业统一的教学计划的意义。他说：今后各校培养的学生都将输送到现代化的工业岗位上去，有了统一的教学计划才可以保证培养合格的工业技术人材。对于国家建设来说，这是一件大事。他说：这七个专业的统一的教学计划草案经中央高等教育部批准后，将从一九五三年的一年级开始试行。他指出，统一的教学计划，是各校努力的方向，但并非要求各校马上都全部按这一计划实行，各校可根据自己不同条件逐步做到全部实行。本科其他专业的教学计划，各校可以根据全国高等工业学校行政会议的精神和这次座谈会实际经验加以适当修订。
