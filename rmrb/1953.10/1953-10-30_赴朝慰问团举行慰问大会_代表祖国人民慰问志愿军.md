Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Third Chinese People's Comfort Delegation to Korea held a grand comfort meeting on October 28 at the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers. More than 6,000 people attended the meeting, including cadres and soldiers of the leading organs of the Chinese People's Volunteers, as well as representatives of decorated heroes, models, and meritorious personnel from various units. In front of the rostrum were displayed samples of the comfort items, including a huge color-embroidered map marked with abundant products, embroidered with: "Defend our beautiful rivers and mountains, and build a great industrialized motherland!"

When General He Long, head of the comfort delegation, accompanied General Deng Hua, Deputy Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, General Yang Dezhi, Chief of Staff Li Da, Deputy Director of the Political Department Zhang Nansheng, Commander of the Logistics Command Hong Xuezhi, Deputy Director of the Cadre Management Department General Yuan Shengping, and leaders of the artillery and engineering units, as well as representatives of heroes, models, and meritorious personnel, onto the rostrum, the audience burst into thunderous applause. Then, members of the comfort delegation's cultural troupe presented flowers to the leaders of the Volunteers and representatives of heroes, models, and meritorious personnel, and members of the Volunteers' cultural troupe also presented flowers to the leaders of the comfort delegation.

General He Long, head of the comfort delegation, first conveyed to all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers the gratitude and love of the people of the motherland and Chairman Mao on behalf of the people of the motherland and Chairman Mao. General He Long said: The people of the motherland are grateful to you, because your victory has safeguarded the security of the motherland, enabling the people of the motherland to carry out restoration and construction work with peace of mind. The people of the motherland love you because you are loyal to the entrustment of the people of the motherland. In the war against the American aggressors, you demonstrated a heroic and tenacious spirit and a quality of sacrificing yourself for the motherland. At yesterday's medal awarding ceremony, the many heroes and meritorious personnel who received Korean medals were good examples for the Chinese people. The people of the motherland will never forget the great achievements of Huang Jiguang, Yang Lian, Qiu Shaoyun, Sun Zhanyuan, and many other martyrs. General He Long said: In order to thank you for your great achievements, the people of the motherland have sent us to comfort you. I think the greatest comfort for you is that the body of our beloved and great leader Chairman Mao is very healthy (prolonged applause from the audience), and the bodies of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai are all very healthy (enthusiastic applause from the audience). They are all tirelessly leading the construction work in all aspects of our motherland, and they are always concerned about you, because you are good soldiers of Chairman Mao, and have brought honor to the country. After describing the restoration and construction of the motherland, the good life and work of the families of the Volunteers, and the brand-new appearance of all cities and villages in our country, General He Long sincerely hoped that the Volunteers would carefully summarize their experiences in the post-war period, learn advanced Soviet military science, and continue to improve on the existing basis in order to enhance the strength of defending peace. At the same time, he hoped that the Volunteers would earnestly help the Korean people to rebuild their homes. General He Long pointed out: The faster the reconstruction work in Korea proceeds, and the closer the unity between the Korean and Chinese people, the more powerful we will be, and the less dare the enemy will be to carry out provocations wantonly.

After General He Long's speech, amid warm applause and military music, the comfort delegation presented a velvet brocade flag embroidered with "Long Live the Victory of Resisting America and Aiding Korea" to General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Deputy Commander Deng Hua accepted the flag on behalf of Commander Peng Dehuai.

Next, representatives from the democratic parties, trade unions, the People's Liberation Army, youth, women, ethnic groups, and the literary and art circles delivered comfort speeches successively.

Zhang Bojun, representative of the democratic parties and Deputy Head of the comfort delegation, spoke at the meeting. He said: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the democratic parties of our motherland have made certain progress and strengthened their unity through various great movements, especially through the great Resist America and Aid Korea Movement, which has profoundly educated the members of our democratic parties in the ideology of patriotism and internationalism. We regard the heroic Volunteers as a model for our ideological transformation and service to the people.

Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and Deputy Head of the comfort delegation, extended congratulations and comfort to the most beloved people of the motherland on behalf of the vast number of male and female workers of the motherland. He said: The male and female workers of the motherland are confidently carrying out the labor emulation campaign of increasing production and practicing economy, and are struggling to achieve a comprehensive over-fulfillment of the national plan. Zhu Xuefan went on to say: The reason why the workers of the motherland have these achievements is inseparable from the fact that your heroic struggle on the front line inspires them. The workers of the motherland, together with the people of the whole country, are vigorously carrying out economic construction, strengthening national defense, and continuing to carry out the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement in depth.

Chen Yi, representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Deputy Head of the comfort delegation, spoke. He said: You have already made immortal contributions to the motherland, and have set a good example for our People's Liberation Army, and have figured out the enemy's situation, which not only greatly helps our army building, but also greatly encourages our confidence in victory in defending the motherland.

Wu Han, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation and Deputy Head of the comfort delegation, pointed out in his speech that the heroic actions of the Volunteers on the battlefield are constantly inspiring the youth of the whole country to advance bravely. In particular, the revolutionary heroism and the noble qualities of great internationalism displayed by Huang Jiguang, Qiu Shaoyun, Luo Shengjiao, and others have become models for young people to learn and act.

Kang Keqing, Standing Committee Member and Director of the Women and Children's Welfare Department of the All-China Women's Federation, and Deputy Head of the comfort delegation, spoke on behalf of women across the country. She said that the women of the motherland deeply understand that our safety and happiness are inseparable from your heroic struggle. Women across the country are always concerned about you and support you in various ways.

Zhandong Kainqiong, a representative of the Tibetan ethnic group, spoke. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude and high respect to the Volunteers on behalf of the Tibetan monks and lay people. After describing the past painful life of the Tibetan people and the happy life after liberation, he said: This bright future of the Tibetan people was brought to us by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and it is also inseparable from the heroic struggle of the Volunteer comrades in Korea to defend the motherland.

Lao She, People's Artist and Deputy Head of the comfort delegation, spoke last. He pointed out that the excellent and noble spiritual qualities, the simple and hardworking lifestyle, and the brave and strong fighting will of the Volunteers have deeply educated the literary and art workers who have been to Korea.

On behalf of the leading organs of the Volunteers and all commanders, fighters, and staff members, he expressed his sincere and deep gratitude and respect to the Third Chinese People's Comfort Delegation to Korea, headed by General He Long. He said: The great victory achieved by the Volunteers in fighting abroad for three years is the result of the full support of the people of the motherland under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, who provided the Volunteers with "people when they needed people, grain when they needed grain, guns when they needed guns, and money when they needed money." We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude and pay our highest respects to the great people of the motherland and our great leader Chairman Mao. After wishing the comrades of the comfort delegation a successful work, Deputy Commander Deng Hua solemnly stated: We are determined to defend our positions and prevent any provocations and invasion activities by the enemy. If the enemy dares to violate the agreement and launch aggression again, we have the determination, the confidence, and the means to give the enemy an even more severe blow.

After the meeting, the comfort delegation's cultural troupe performed wonderful songs and dances and Peking opera programs. Famous Peking opera actors Mei Lanfang, Zhou Xinfang, Cheng Yanqiu, and Ma Lianliang all performed for the most beloved people.
