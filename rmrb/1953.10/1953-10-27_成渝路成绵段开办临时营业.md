    The Chengdu-Mianyang section of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway will begin temporary incidental operations from October 28th. One pair of mixed trains will run daily between Chengdu and Mianyang, selling hard-seat passenger tickets and group tickets, and handling responsible luggage, self-service parcels, and self-service full-car freight transportation.

    Regarding freight rates, passenger fares have been approved by the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government and the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee, and will be handled according to the current fares of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Due to the fact that the Tianfu-Chengdu Railway is still under construction, there are fewer sources of goods other than the transportation of engineering materials, and transportation costs are relatively high. Therefore, under the requirement of maintaining railway transportation costs, and according to the operational management principle of implementing economic accounting in the People's Railway, it will be increased by 42.8% compared to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The passenger and freight rates specified in this way are still lower than the automobile freight rates on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway.

    After the Chengdu-Mianyang section opens for temporary incidental business, the prices of daily necessities such as cloth, general merchandise, and salt needed by the people along the route will be reduced compared to the past, and petroleum and other materials needed for Chengdu's industry will be transported more quickly.

    成渝路成绵段开办临时营业
    天成铁路成都到绵阳段将从十月二十八日起开办临时附带营业。成都绵阳间每日将对开混合列车一对，发售硬席客票、团体客票，办理负责行李、自理包裹和自理整车货物运输。
    在运价方面，客运运价已经中央人民政府铁道部和西南财政经济委员会核定，照成渝铁路现行运价办理。货运运价由于天成铁路尚在施工时期，除工程材料运输外，货源较少，运输成本较高，因此在维持铁路运输成本的要求下，根据人民铁道实行经济核算制的经营管理原则，比照成渝铁路增加百分之四十二点八。这样规定的客货运价仍比川陕公路的汽车运价低。
    成绵段开办临时附带营业后，沿线人民所需要的布匹、百货、盐等日用品的运价将比过去降低，成都工业所需的石油等将会较迅速地运来。
