(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 25th) The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean Military Armistice Commission issued the following communiqué on the 24th:

	The rampant and heinous actions of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents in the Dongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp under Indian custody have made it impossible for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to exercise its legitimate functions.

	Regarding the various crimes of these Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents that thoroughly undermine the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work," Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side, has successively sent letters to Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, on October 23rd and 24th, requesting the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to take effective measures to stop them.

	Huang Lichao, a Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier repatriated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, witnessed Zhang Zilong, a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the same camp (the 28th camp under Indian custody), on October 3rd, being stripped naked by Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents for expressing his willingness to return home, having the flesh on his arms and chest cut away, and finally having his heart dug out. The next day, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agent "Battalion Commander" even summoned the prisoners of war in the camp for a "lecture," saying, "This is the result of wanting to return to the mainland." In his letter of October 23rd, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao requested the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to conduct an on-site investigation and immediately severely punish the instigator and accomplices of this tragedy according to the law. Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao also stated that the Korean-Chinese side is willing to provide the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission with all possible assistance, including providing witnesses, identifying the burial site of the victim, and identifying the murderers.

	According to Wu Mingjun, a captured soldier of the Korean People's Army repatriated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, he was detained in the torture chamber of a dungeon by the Syngman Rhee bandit special agent "Battalion Commander" of the 36th camp under Indian custody. Although Wu Mingjun has escaped by chance, there are still seven captured soldiers of the Korean People's Army in the torture chamber, suffering extremely barbaric torture and persecution from the Syngman Rhee bandit special agents. In his letter of October 24th, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao requested the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to immediately investigate this matter, rescue the above-mentioned seven captured soldiers of the Korean People's Army whose lives are in danger, and severely punish all Syngman Rhee special agents according to the law. Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao also attached a map of the location of the torture chamber.

	As for the series of incidents in which Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents attacked Korean-Chinese personnel during the explanation work, the relevant personnel of the Korean-Chinese side protested to the affiliated organizations of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the spot and demanded that the murderers be punished. At that time, the Indian custodial forces also promised to arrest and detain all the more than fifty criminals separately. In another letter of October 24th, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao requested the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to inform them of the separate detention of these criminals, pointing out that these criminals must be severely punished according to the law, and the results of the handling should be announced to all prisoners of war as a warning to others.

    军事停战委员会朝中代表团发表公报
    印度看管部队必须严惩蒋李特务凶犯
    【新华社开城二十五日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中代表团二十四日发表公报如下：
    印军看管下的东场里战俘营内，蒋李特务横行，无恶不作，实已使中立国遣返委员会无法行使其合法职权。
    对于蒋李特务这些彻底破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”以及“解释和访问工作细则”的各种罪行，朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将已在十月二十三日和二十四日，先后致函中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将，要求中立国遣返委员会采取有效措施予以制止。
    由中立国遣返委员会遣返归来的中国人民志愿军黄立超，在被拘留于印军看管下的第二十八号营场时，曾目睹同营场的中国人民志愿军被俘人员张子龙，于十月三日因表示愿意回家而被蒋匪特务剥光衣服，将臂上及胸前的肉挖去，最后又把张的心挖出；次日，蒋匪特务“大队长”还召集该营场战俘“训话”，说“这就是想回大陆的结果”。李相朝中将已于十月二十三日的信中，要求中立国遣返委员会进行现场调查，立即将这一惨案的主使者及其帮凶依法严办。李相朝中将并表示：朝中方面愿给予中立国遣返委员会一切可能的协助，包括提供人证，指明被害者的埋葬地点及识别凶手。
    另据中立国遣返委员会遣返归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员吴明俊控诉：他在印军看管下的第三十六号营场内，曾被该营场的李匪特务“大队长”拘禁于地牢的苦刑室中。吴明俊现虽已乘机逃出，但尚有七名朝鲜人民军被俘人员仍在该苦刑室中，受到李匪特务极端野蛮的拷打与迫害。李相朝中将在十月二十四日的信中，要求中立国遣返委员会也应立即对此事进行调查，救出生命正处于危险中的上述七名朝鲜人民军被俘人员，并依法严办所有的李承晚特务。李相朝中将并随函附去该苦刑室的所在地点图。
    至于蒋匪特务在解释工作过程中攻击朝中人员的一连串事件，朝中方面有关人员曾当场向中立国遣返委员会各附属机构提出抗议，并要求惩办凶手，当时，印度看管部队亦曾答应将全部凶犯五十余名，一一逮捕单独看押。李相朝中将在十月二十四日的又一信中，要求中立国遣返委员会告以这些刑事犯单独看押的情况，指出此等凶犯必须依法严惩，并将处理结果向全体战俘公布，以儆效尤。
