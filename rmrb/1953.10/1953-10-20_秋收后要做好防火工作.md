    Do a good job of fire prevention after the autumn harvest
    Hao Jingchun from Zengjia Village, Seventh District, Kaiyuan County, Liaoxi Province writes: This year, farmers in our county have universally studied the advanced experience of Zhaoyuan in achieving high yields, and most crops have achieved bumper harvests and have now been harvested and brought to the fields and gardens. However, some farmers have not paid enough attention to fire prevention in the fields and gardens. For example, Sun You, a farmer in Yaobao Village, Zengjia Village, smoked in the field, and the ash fell into the field, almost burning the bean stacks; fortunately, the rescue was timely, and no fire occurred. It is recommended that cadres in various regions and villages educate the masses to earnestly do a good job in fire prevention after the autumn harvest and earnestly protect the fruits of their year's hard work.

    秋收后要做好防火工作
    辽西省开原县七区曾家村郝景春来信：今年我县农民普遍学习了肇源丰产先进经验，大部分作物获得丰收，现已收割好拉到场园。但有的农民对场园的防火工作没有很好注意。如曾家村腰堡屯农民孙有在场园里抽烟，烟灰火掉在场园内，差点烧了豆垛；幸亏抢救及时，才没造成火灾。建议各地区、村干部教育群众在秋收后切实做好防火工作，认真保护自己一年辛勤劳动的果实。
