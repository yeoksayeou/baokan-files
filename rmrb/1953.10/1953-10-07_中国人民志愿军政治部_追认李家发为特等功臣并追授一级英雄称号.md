    Posthumous Conferment of Special-Class Hero Title to Li Jiafa by the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

    The Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army recently approved the posthumous recognition of Li Jiafa, a hero in the style of Huang Jiguang and a member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, as a special-class hero, and posthumously awarded him the honorary title of first-class hero.

    Li Jiafa was from Yanhucun Village, District 1, Nanling County, Anhui Province. He joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in June 1951 and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League in October 1952. In the first half of this year, he was awarded a third-class merit for his outstanding work.

    On the rainy night of July 13, the unit where Li Jiafa served before his death launched a counterattack on the Jiaoyan Mountain position on the Jin-Cheng front. Under the cover of our army's powerful artillery fire, Li Jiafa followed the assault platoon and charged towards the southern foot of Jiaoyan Mountain. On an open charging route, our army's assault troops were blocked by machine gun fire from two remaining enemy bunkers, making it impossible to advance. At that time, Li Jiafa bravely took on the task of blasting enemy bunkers. During the blasting process, his left leg was seriously injured, but he still crawled forward step by step and destroyed a small enemy bunker with explosive grenades. He continued to advance and quickly approached the large bunker. He threw his last grenade into the enemy bunker's firing port, and the machine gun in the bunker stopped firing. The soldiers immediately jumped out of the mud and charged forward. Suddenly, the enemy's machine gun fired fiercely again. At this critical moment, Li Jiafa threw himself onto the firing port of the bunker with his chest, blocking the bullets fired by the enemy. Li Jiafa's heroic action ensured the smooth advance of the assault troops and played a decisive role in the battle to capture the southern foot of Jiaoyan Mountain.

    追认李家发为特等功臣并追授一级英雄称号
    中国人民志愿军政治部最近批准追认黄继光式的英雄、中国新民主主义青年团员李家发为特等功臣，并追授一级英雄的光荣称号。
    李家发是安徽省南陵县一区岩虎村人，一九五一年六月参加中国人民志愿军，一九五二年十月参加中国新民主主义青年团，今年上半年，曾因工作中有显著成绩立过三等功。
    七月十三日的雨夜里，李家发生前所在的部队向金城前线的轿岩山阵地发起反击。在我军强大炮火的掩护下，李家发随着突击排冲向轿岩山的南山脚。在一片开阔的冲锋道路上，我军的突击部队遭到了敌人残存的两个碉堡中机枪火力的封锁，不能前进。当时李家发勇敢地担负起爆破敌人碉堡的任务。在爆破途中，他的左脚负了重伤，仍一步一步地向前爬进，并用炸药手榴弹炸毁了敌人的一个小地堡。他又继续前进，迅速接近了大碉堡。他用最后一颗手榴弹投进敌人的碉堡射口，碉堡里的机枪停止了射击。战士们立刻从泥泞里跳出来，向前猛冲。突然，敌人的机枪又猛射起来。在这紧要的时刻，李家发用自己的胸膛猛扑到碉堡的射口上，挡住了敌人射出来的子弹。李家发的这种英雄行动，保证了突击部队顺利前进，在攻克轿岩山南山脚的战斗中起了决定性的作用。
