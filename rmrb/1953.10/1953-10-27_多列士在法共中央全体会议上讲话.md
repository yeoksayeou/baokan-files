Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 26th: According to TASS, the Central Committee plenum of the French Communist Party concluded on October 23rd.

    The meeting discussed Duclos's report. Those who spoke during the discussion included Laurent Casanova, Victor Loret, Waldeck Rochet, and Gaston Rouget. They all emphasized the scale of the August strikes in France and the expansion of the peasant masses' protest movement, which made it possible for the working people to take more extensive action in solidarity. The speakers all supported Duclos's report on striving to unite all democratic and patriotic forces in France to prevent the ratification of the Bonn and Paris military treaties.

    Auguste Lecoeur gave a report to the plenary session on "Raising the Communist Party's Activities to a Higher Level." Lecoeur pointed out that it is necessary to tirelessly improve the ideological and political level of party activists and all party members, so that they can thoroughly understand the tasks before them and master the knowledge necessary to complete the tasks. Lecoeur called for strengthening criticism and self-criticism within the party, which is a weapon to overcome errors and correct shortcomings in work.

    When Maurice Thorez stepped onto the podium, the entire audience greeted him with stormy applause. When talking about the consequences of the Marshall Plan and the Atlantic Group's policies on France, Thorez pointed out: "This cannot be allowed to continue any longer, this situation must be changed! This is the call issued by the entire people in the August strikes and the recent peasant movement. The number of railway workers, postal workers, and civil servants on strike was so large and for such a long time, it was unprecedented. It is only natural that the strikers, in their struggle to abolish the emergency decree and raise wages, concluded that Parliament must be convened and government policy must be changed." Thorez went on to say: The struggle of workers, civil servants, and peasants was carried out in mutual understanding and sympathy, which is a new and irrefutable fact. The working people of the cities and countryside have established a feeling of cooperation in the struggle, which is the struggle of the entire nation against the privileged minority and foreign lackeys who are leading the country to bankruptcy and war. All the facts are convincing that in order to eliminate serious difficulties, it is also necessary to change the direction of our foreign policy. It is necessary to implement a policy that is in line with the interests of France, a policy of national independence and peace. First of all, it is necessary to eliminate the fatal danger facing our country, which is due to the unasked for revival of German militarism and the army of German revanchists in any form. There is nothing more important and more urgent than uniting all true French people to tear up the Bonn and Paris treaties. Thorez emphasized: The Franco-Soviet Treaty must be implemented, a treaty that is the result of actions combined with the struggle against fascist aggressors. Thorez said: This treaty can help our country gain freedom of action in foreign policy. It is incorrect to think that the passage of the Bonn and Paris treaties is inevitable. France can and should say: "Not so." The united action of all defenders of national independence and peace in the country and in Parliament can and should prevent the ratification of these two evil treaties.

    The plenary session closed after passing a resolution.

    多列士在法共中央全体会议上讲话
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党中央委员会全体会议在十月二十三日闭幕。
    会议讨论了杜克洛的报告。讨论时发言的有洛·加桑诺瓦、维·巴雷尔、瓦·罗歇、加·鲁戈特等。他们都着重谈到法国八月罢工的规模和农民群众抗议运动的扩大，这些都使得劳动人民在团结一致的情况下可能更加广泛地行动起来。发言的人都拥护杜克洛关于努力争取团结法国所有的民主和爱国力量以制止批准波恩和巴黎军事条约的报告。
    奥·勒戈尔在全体会议上做了“把共产党的活动提到更高的水平”的报告。勒戈尔指出：必须不倦地提高党的活动分子和全体党员的思想水平和政治水平，以便他们透彻了解他们面前的任务，并掌握为完成任务所必需的知识。勒戈尔号召加强党内批评和自我批评，这是克服工作中的错误和纠正工作中的缺点的武器。
    多列士登上讲台，全场报以暴风雨般的掌声。多列士在谈到马歇尔计划和大西洋集团的政策在法国造成的后果时指出：“这不能再任其继续下去了，必须要改变这种情况！这就是全体人民在八月罢工中和最近的农民运动中所发出来的呼声。铁路工人、邮政工人和机关职员罢工的人数这样众多，而且时间这样长，这是过去从未有过的。罢工者在为废除紧急措施法令和提高工资的斗争中，得出的结论是必须召开议会并改变政府政策，这是很自然的。”多列士接着说：工人、职员和农民的斗争是在互相了解和同情的情况下进行的，这是新的铁证如山的事实。城市和乡村的劳动人民在斗争中建立了合作的感情，这个斗争是整个民族反对那些把国家引向破产和战争的享有特权的少数人和外国走狗的斗争。一切事实使人深信：为了消除严重的困难，必须还要改变我们外交政策的方针。必须实行符合法国利益的政策，实行民族独立与和平的政策。首先，必须消除面临我们国家的致命的危险，这种危险是由于不问以任何形式复活的德国军国主义和德国复仇主义者的军队而发生的。没有比团结一切真正的法国人来撕毁波恩与巴黎条约更为重要、更为迫切的了。多列士着重说：必须实现法苏条约，这个条约是与反对法西斯侵略者的斗争相结合的行动的成果。多列士说：这个条约可以帮助我国在外交政策方面获得行动自由。认为波恩与巴黎条约的通过不可避免是不正确的。法国能够而且也应当说：“不是这样。”一切民族独立与和平的保卫者在全国和议会内的一致行动，能够而且应该制止批准这两个罪恶条约。
    全体会议在通过决议后闭幕。
