Many great soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, including the unit where the first-class hero Qiu Shaoyun was stationed before his death, and many units that had established meritorious service on the Korean battlefield, wrote letters to all workers and staff of well-known industrial units such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, and Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, to warmly congratulate the fourth National Day of the motherland on the eve of National Day.

The commanders and combatants of the unit where the great soldier and martyr Qiu Shaoyun was stationed before his death, wrote a letter to all the staff of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, warmly congratulating them on their achievements in production and construction, and hoping that they would complete the plan to save 850 billion yuan of wealth for the country and overfulfill this year's state plan. The commanders and combatants of a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which achieved brilliant victories in the summer of this year in Keho-ri Namsan, Kuridong Namsan, "Gyeonggi Mountain" and the Kimhwa counterattack, annihilated more than 40,000 enemy troops, and advanced the front by more than 70 square kilometers, wrote to all the staff of Anshan Iron and Steel Company who were building large rolling mills and seamless steel pipe plants to congratulate them on National Day. They said in their letter: "Our great motherland is calling on workers across the country to overfulfill this year's state plan, which is an important start to realizing the country's industrialization. We sincerely hope that you will achieve greater success in the great work of building our motherland. We at the Korean front guarantee to vigilantly guard the position, practice strict economy, tighten expenses, and cherish all materials that the motherland supports us, so that the country can use more strength to engage in major construction undertakings."

A reconnaissance squad that wiped out the command post of the 1st Regiment of the ROK Capital Division in the summer counterattack wrote a letter to the workers of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, saying: "With the help of the Soviet big brother, you are building the first automobile factory in the motherland. We congratulate you on the early success of the automobile factory and making good achievements for the economic construction of the motherland."

The "Dingzishan" Combat Hero Company wrote to all the workers of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, saying: "Recently, we saw pictures of your factory's construction in the 'PLA Pictorial', and learned that you will be able to manufacture heavy rolling mills, large cranes, and coking equipment for the motherland in two years, as well as various other large machines. Every comrade is happy and proud of the birth of this heavy machinery factory in the motherland. We sincerely hope that the people of the whole country will work together to ensure that all 141 large-scale construction projects that the Soviet government has decided to help our country build and renovate are completed according to plan. We guarantee that everyone will cherish every bullet, every thread provided by the people of the motherland. We will resolutely implement Marshal Kim Il-sung's and Commander Peng Dehuai's ceasefire order, and strive for the complete implementation of the armistice agreement and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue!"
