Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 18th: Today is Sunday. According to item 22 of the "Detailed Regulations for Explanation and Visitation Work" passed by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission regarding no explanation work on Sundays, the Korean-Chinese side did not conduct explanation work.

The Korean-Chinese side notified the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission this morning of the work plan for tomorrow (October 19th) to conduct explanations for Korean People's Army prisoners of war. This was originally the work plan for the 16th, but it was not carried out because the U.S. side instructed special agents to obstruct it.

In the three days since the start of the explanation work, due to the U.S. side's instigation of special agents to obstruct and disrupt, the "Detailed Regulations for Explanation and Visitation Work" regarding eight hours of explanation work per day have been undermined. The total working time for the 15th and 17th combined was approximately seven hours, and no work was carried out at all on the 16th. Moreover, while the explanation work was in progress, the U.S. side's so-called observer representatives and interpreters repeatedly violated the regulations, unreasonably interrupting the explanation work, and using various means to intimidate prisoners of war from requesting repatriation. Special agents mixed in with the prisoners of war also deliberately shouted abuse, and even beat explanation representatives, disrupting the explanation work. The situation in the past three days shows that the U.S. side's destructive actions have made it impossible for the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work to proceed normally, and even more impossible for prisoners of war to freely exercise their right to be repatriated.

### 根据星期日不进行解释的规定  朝中方面十月十八日没有进行解释工作

    根据星期日不进行解释的规定
    朝中方面十月十八日没有进行解释工作
    【新华社开城十八日电】今天是星期日，根据中立国遣返委员会通过的“解释和访问工作细则”第二十二项关于星期日不进行解释的规定，朝中方面未进行解释工作。
    朝中方面已在今天上午把明天（十九日）向朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行解释的工作计划通知中立国遣返委员会。这原是十六日的工作计划，因美方指令特务分子横加阻挠而未曾执行。
    解释工作开始三天以来，由于美方策动特务分子进行阻挠和捣乱，“解释和访问工作细则”关于解释工作每天应进行八小时的规定已遭到了破坏。十五、十七两日加起来的工作时间共约七小时，十六日则根本未能进行。而且，在解释工作进行时，美方的所谓观察代表和译员一再违反规定，蛮横无理地打断解释工作的进行，用各种手段恫吓战俘不得要求遣返。混在战俘中间的特务分子也故意嘶喊辱骂，甚至殴打解释代表，捣乱解释工作的进行。这三天来的情况表明：美方的这种破坏行动，已使得朝中方面的解释工作不能正常进行，更不能使战俘自由地行使被遣返的权利。
