The Huainan Mining Bureau Drilling Team has comprehensively completed its annual drilling task of 10,050 meters in the Bagongshan New Coalfield area two and a half months ahead of schedule. Drilling efficiency increased by 13% compared to the planned target, costs were reduced by 2.2%, quality met national standards, and there were no fatalities.

The early completion of this year's drilling task has opened up bright development prospects for the Huainan mining area. The large-scale Xiejiaji Coalfield, which is scheduled to begin construction next year, has been proven by drilling to have 24 layers of coal lying flat underground, with the thickest being 7 meters. Approximately half of the coal can be used to produce coke, which is in great need to supply the nation’s smelting industry.

Due to the successful completion of the task, the drilling project in the Laishanjji Coalfield of the Bagongshan area has started ahead of schedule. Newly moved drilling rigs stand tall, machinery is being transported, power lines are being erected, and some drilling machines have already started turning. All employees of the Huainan Mining Bureau Drilling Team are currently working intensely to exceed the drilling target by 3,100 meters and complete this year's glorious production increase and savings plan.

    淮南矿务局钻探大队提前完成任务
    已探明谢家集井田煤藏丰厚
    淮南矿务局钻探大队已提前两个半月，全面地完成了八公山新煤田区全年钻探一万零五十公尺的任务。钻探效率比计划指标提高了百分之十三，成本则降低了百分之二点二，质量合乎国家规定标准，并且消灭了死亡事故。
    今年钻探任务的提前完成，给淮南矿区开辟了美好的发展前程。即将在明年动工的规模巨大的谢家集井田，经钻探证明平铺在地下的煤有二十四层，最厚的有七公尺，其中并有一半左右的煤可以炼出焦炭，大量供应国家冶炼工业的需要。
    由于任务完成得好，八公山区癞山集井田的钻探工程已提前开工。新移来的钻架高矗着，机器正在搬运，输电线路正在架设，有的钻机已开始转动。淮南矿务局钻探大队全体职工目前正在为再超额钻进三千一百公尺，完成今年光荣的增产节约计划而紧张地工作着。（新华社）
