    Harbin Technical School Further Improves the Hui Student Dining Hall
    Letter from Harbin Technical School: The "Reader's Letters in Brief" column on September 2nd published a reader's criticism of our school's insufficient attention to the living habits of Hui students. We are now informing you of the actual situation and the results of the handling:
    Our school was only established in January of this year. Although there were many students, few rooms, and few cooks at the time, we established a Hui student dining hall for 16 Hui students in February. In May, the Hui dining hall was temporarily moved due to construction within the school; another Hui student dining hall was built in June. Because there were few cooks, the Hui students agreed to eat the same food as the general students, but there was a dedicated cook to prepare the dishes. However, this cook was not conscientious in his work, and once brought pork into the dishes. After the Hui students reported this, the school leaders paid attention to the problem and urged the cadres in charge of food to strengthen the management of the Hui student dining hall. After seeing the reader's letter in your newspaper, our school convened a meeting of Hui students to study ways to further improve the Hui student dining hall in the future. The meeting decided to find a Hui cook for the Hui students, further repair the current dining hall, and select a food group leader from among the Hui students to participate in the management of the dining hall. The Hui students expressed satisfaction with this handling.

    哈尔滨技工学校进一步改善回族学生食堂
    哈尔滨技工学校来信：九月二日“读者来信摘要”栏登载了读者批评我校对回族学生生活习惯照顾不够的来信。现将实际情况和处理结果告诉你们：
    我校是今年一月才成立的，当时虽然学员多、房屋少、炊事员人数也少，但在二月间即为十六名回民同学成立了回族学生食堂。五月份因校内进行修建，回民食堂曾暂时搬动一下；六月份另外修了一间回族学生食堂。因为炊事员少，回族同学同意和一般同学吃一样的饭，但专有一个炊事员做菜。而这个炊事员工作不认真，做菜时曾把猪肉带到菜里去。经回族同学反映后，我校领导方面就重视了这个问题，督促管理伙食的干部加强对回族学生食堂的管理。看到你报读者的批评信后，我校召集回族同学们开会，研究今后进一步改善回族学生食堂的办法。会上决定给回族同学找一位回族炊事员，把现在的食堂再进一步的修理，并从回族同学中选出伙食组长来参加食堂管理工作。回族同学对这样的处理都表示满意。
