Xinhua News Agency, October 5th: The Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers resumed on the afternoon of the 3rd.

On the 3rd and 4th, Li Fuchun, Vice Chairman of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government, and Liao Luyan, Deputy Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered reports to all delegates on national industrial construction and rural work, respectively.

On the morning of the 5th, the congress continued, with representatives from various literary and art associations speaking at the meeting. More than 20 foreign guests were invited to the meeting to offer congratulations, including representatives from the Romanian, Czechoslovakian, and Polish cultural delegations, Japanese dramatist Kan'emon Nakamura, and Chilean painter Venturelli.

The writer Ding Ling spoke first. Based on her personal experience, she analyzed the reasons for the lack of excellent literary works in recent years. She believed that the main problem was the "life" issue of writers. She said: Writers must delve into life, understand life, and analyze life. The life depicted in literary works must be consistent with the struggle life that the writer participates in daily.

The head of the Romanian cultural delegation, Eugen Frunza, delivered a speech full of brotherly friendship towards the Chinese people. He said: Romanian literary and art workers are extremely concerned about the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people in the economic, political, cultural and artistic fields.

The head of the Czechoslovak cultural delegation, Marie Majerova, said: The Czechoslovak cultural delegation brings the enthusiastic greetings of all Czech and Slovak writers, poets, artists, dramatists and musicians to the congress. Majerova then briefly described the work of Czech and Slovak literature and art.

The head of the Polish cultural delegation, Włodzimierz Sokorski, used poetic language to describe the friendship between the Chinese and Polish people. He said: Learning and inheriting national cultural heritage is a common ground for cultural and artistic work in China and Poland. Although the delegation has been in China for a short time, it has developed a deep affection for the art of the Chinese people.

After the foreign guests spoke, representatives from various associations spoke successively.

Zheng Zhenduo spoke on the issue of studying national literary and artistic heritage. He said: To create works that are loved and enjoyed by the broad masses of the people, it is necessary to have a national style or national form that can be accepted by the broad masses of the people. Our excellent national literary and artistic heritage is surprisingly rich. It is an inexhaustible source for our creation.

Dramatists Tian Han and Cao Yu expressed their opinions on developing theatrical creation and performance art. They unanimously believed that actors should strive to improve their ideological cultivation and performance skills. In his speech, Cao Yu particularly emphasized the importance of developing spoken drama.

The composer Lü Ji spoke at the meeting, pointing out that music creation should be strengthened in the future, and efforts should be made to diversify the selection of materials and forms. He hoped that poets would help musicians write more lyrics.

Jiang Feng, representing art workers, said: Only when art workers have advanced ideas and proficient expressive skills can they create art works with a high degree of ideology and artistry that the people hope for.

Wang Zunsan, a representative of the Quyi (Chinese folk art forms) circle, said: We Quyi workers must unite with each other, work hard to transform, and step up our work. With the help of writers and musicians, we must do a good job in the reform of Quyi.

The dance worker representative Dai Ailian pointed out that in recent years, under the care and cultivation of the Communist Party and the cultural departments of the People's Government, dance work is blooming like a flower. She said: In the future, dance workers must develop new dance art based on national dance, and express the life and hope of the people with correct ideas and healthy dance forms.

At the meeting, Zhao Feng, Deputy Secretary-General of the Congress, read out congratulatory telegrams from 25 famous Soviet writers such as Fadeyev, Surkov, Simonov, Sholokhov, Ehrenburg, and Tikhonov, which were warmly applauded by all the representatives.
