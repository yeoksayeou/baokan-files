Xinhua News Agency dispatch: To celebrate the October Revolution Day, Soviet steel workers are continuously achieving new production successes as gifts.

    In Dnepropetrovsk, workers at the No. 1 open-hearth furnace workshop of the Petrovsky Iron and Steel Plant completed their October production plan on the 19th, overproducing more than 8,000 tons of steel. The workers of the fourth open-hearth furnace workshop of the plant smelted 448 heats of steel without furnace repairs, and in October, 60 percent of the steel in the workshop was smelted using the rapid steelmaking method. Steelmaker Dovganyuk exceeded the quota of 5.3 tons of steel per square meter of furnace bottom on the 18th, smelting 7.22 tons. Minrik, a young worker in the second open-hearth furnace workshop, also surpassed Dovganyuk's steelmaking record. In the first seventeen days of October, 86 percent of his steel was smelted using the rapid steelmaking method, and he overproduced 123 tons of steel beyond the plan. The plant's workshops have increased steel production by an average of 1.2 percent in recent periods. Since the beginning of this year, the plant has saved 650 tons of ore.

    In Leningrad, the steel workers of the Voroshilov Factory completed the October plan on the 20th due to the unfolding of the production increase emulation. Five sheet metal rolling mills have adopted rapid methods, and output has increased one to two times. Rolling workers Golovanova and Ermakova overproduce 2,000 meters of steel strips per day beyond the plan. The steelmaking workers in the steel casting workshop of the Leningrad Neva Machine Building Factory not only completed the October plan, but also increased the production of 900 tons of steel. In addition, the steelmaking workers of the Moscow Electric Steel Factory, due to the adoption of advanced rapid steelmaking methods, completed the October production plan half a month ahead of schedule. From the beginning of this year to now, they have smelted 5,000 heats of steel.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Many machine tractor stations and collective farms throughout the Soviet Union are enthusiastically launching production emulations to greet the October Socialist Revolution Day and have achieved remarkable results.

    In the Omsk region, the Demyanov Machine Tractor Station in the Gorky district cultivated 85 percent of the fields for the collective farms it served last year, but this year it has cultivated 95 percent of the total farmland of the collective farms, and the depth of plowing is 25 to 30 centimeters, and the harvesting time has also been advanced a lot. According to the provisions of the contract signed between the station and the collective farms, all plowing work should be completed before October 10th this year, but advanced experience has proved that if plowing can be completed in September, the harvest volume next year can be increased by 30 to 40 percent. Therefore, all the tractor drivers of the station enthusiastically launched a socialist emulation drive, working in shifts day and night, regardless of rainy weather. As a result, all the cultivated land of the collective farms was plowed ahead of schedule before September 28th; by October 10th, the fallow land had been plowed. The station originally planned to plow 56,130 hectares of land with machines this year, but now it has cultivated 81,500 hectares. In the competition, tractor drivers Stepanov and Soskovets each cultivated 1,300 hectares of land in one season. Like them, all the tractor drivers of the Demyanov Machine Tractor Station have overfulfilled the quarterly production quotas. In the Kuibyshev region, the machine tractor stations have cultivated 180,000 hectares more land in autumn plowing work than in the same period last year. The tractor drivers and collective farmers of the Pystrav district's machine tractor station in the state were the first to complete the plowing work. The tractor team led by Belyasov has completed 116 percent of the annual land plowing plan and saved 6,372 kilograms of fuel.

    迎接十月社会主义革命节
    苏联工农业劳动者继续开展竞赛
    据新华社讯：苏联钢铁工人不断获得新的生产成就，作为迎接十月革命节的献礼。
    在第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克，彼得罗夫斯克钢铁厂第一平炉车间的工人们，在十九日就完成了十月份的生产计划，超计划增产了八千多吨钢。该厂第四平炉车间的工人们不修炉烘炼了四百四十八炉钢，在十月份，该车间有百分之六十的钢是用快速炼钢法冶炼的。炼钢工人多夫干纽克十八日超过每平方公尺炉底出钢五点三吨的定额，炼钢七点二二吨。第二平炉车间青年工人敏里克还赶过了多夫干纽克的炼钢成绩。在十月份的头十七天中，他有百分之八十六的钢是用快速炼钢法炼的，他超过计划增产了一百二十三吨钢。该厂各车间在最近期间平均提高产钢量百分之一点二。今年年初以来，该厂节约的矿石已达六百五十吨。
    在列宁格勒，伏罗希洛夫工厂的钢铁工人们由于展开增产竞赛，二十日已完成了十月份的计划。有五台薄板压延机采用快速方法，产量已增加一两倍。轧钢工人哥洛瓦诺瓦和厄尔马科娃每天超计划增产两千公尺钢条。列宁格勒涅瓦机器制造厂铸钢车间的炼钢工人，除完成十月份计划外，还增产了九百吨钢。此外，莫斯科电气钢铁工厂的炼钢工人们由于采用了先进的快速炼钢法，已提前半个月完成十月份生产计划。从今年年初到现在，他们已炼了五千炉钢。
    据新华社讯：苏联全国各地许多机器拖拉机站和集体农庄热烈展开迎接十月社会主义革命节的生产竞赛，获得了显著的成绩。
    在鄂木斯克州，高尔基区的杰米扬诺夫机器拖拉机站在去年为它所服务的各集体农庄耕作了百分之八十五的田地，但今年它所耕作的田地已占各集体农庄农田总面积的百分之九十五，且犁耕的深度都在二十五到三十公分，收割的时间也提早了许多。按照该站与各集体农庄所订的合同的规定，今年全部翻耕工作应在十月十日前完成，但先进的经验证明，如能在九月份内翻耕完毕，明年的收获量就可提高百分之三十到四十。因此，该站的全体拖拉机手就热烈展开社会主义竞赛，不分昼夜、不顾雨天轮班耕作，结果在九月二十八日以前就提前将集体农庄的全部耕地翻耕完毕；到十月十日，又犁耕完了休耕地。该站原计划在今年用机器翻耕五万六千一百三十公顷田地，但现在已耕了八万一千五百公顷。在竞赛中，拖拉机手斯捷潘诺夫和索斯科维茨，在一季中各耕了一千三百公顷田地。和他们两人一样，杰米扬诺夫机器拖拉机站全体拖拉机手都超额完成了季度的生产定额。在古比雪夫州，各机器拖拉机站在秋耕工作中比去年同期多耕了十八万公顷田地。该州彼斯特拉夫区的机器拖拉机站的拖拉机手和集体农民，在全州中首先完成了翻耕工作。该站由别利亚索夫领导的拖拉机队已完成全年翻耕田地计划的百分之一百一十六，并节省了六千三百七十二公斤燃料。
