Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 22nd: The "New Age" newspaper of October 22nd published a letter from a soldier of the Indian Custodial Forces in Korea to his relatives in Kurdpur village, Julundu County, East Punjab Province. The letter exposed the US conspiracy to prevent POWs from requesting repatriation.

The letter said: "You must have seen in the newspapers that the situation here is not very satisfactory. South Korea has sent some people who are actually not POWs to mix with the POWs. These South Korean personnel are carrying out anti-Indian propaganda, not allowing us to complete our mission. They want to kill any POW who asks to return to his homeland."

    印度看管部队士兵写信回国
    揭露美方阻止战俘遣返的阴谋
    【新华社新德里二十二日电】十月二十二日的“新世纪”日报刊载了一位在朝鲜的印度看管部队的士兵写给他在东旁遮普省朱龙多县库尔德普尔村的亲戚的一封信，这封信揭露了美方阻止战俘要求遣返的阴谋。
    这封信里说：“你一定已经在报纸上看到了，这里的情形是不很令人满意的。南朝鲜已派了实际上不是战俘的一些人混到战俘中间。这些南朝鲜人员进行反对印度的宣传，不让我们完成我们的使命。他们要杀害任何一个要求回到自己祖国的战俘。”
