The People's Literature Publishing House has printed 36 kinds of Lu Xun's works (including creations, compilations, and translations), totaling more than 770,000 copies, from September 1952 to September 1953. It plans to print another 250,000 copies within the year. This publication quantity is not only a great increase compared to before liberation, but also an increase of more than 350,000 copies compared to the 417,000 copies published by the company from September 1951 to September 1952.

The vast number of readers in our country have an increasingly high demand for studying Lu Xun. The single edition of "Hometown," published as one of the "Elementary Literary Readers" for workers and peasants, has already been printed in 110,000 copies. The "Lu Xun Short Story Collection," composed of the three short story collections "Call to Arms," "Wandering," and "Old Tales Retold," has already been printed in more than 90,000 copies. Many readers, including those in the Chinese People's Volunteers on the front lines in Korea, frequently write to the People's Literature Publishing House to make requests and suggestions regarding the publication and annotation of Lu Xun's works.

The annotation work on Lu Xun's works by the People's Literature Publishing House is continuing cautiously and meticulously. This work is expected to be basically completed by the end of 1954. From 1955 onwards, the People's Literature Publishing House will publish new editions of Lu Xun's works with annotations. Following Lu Xun's essays, novels, and other works, the publishing house will also publish "Lu Xun's Diary" with brief annotations. (Xinhua News Agency)

    人民文学出版社在一年中
    出版鲁迅著作七十七万多册
    人民文学出版社从一九五二年九月到一九五三年九月，已印行鲁迅著作（包括创作、辑录、翻译）三十六种，共七十七万多册，并计划在年内再印二十五万册。这一出版数量，不但比解放以前大大增加，就是比该社一九五一年九月到一九五二年九月的出版数四十一万七千多册，也增加了三十五万多册。
    我国广大的读者对于学习鲁迅的要求越来越高。作为工农读物的“文学初步读物”之一而出版的“故乡”单行本，已经印行了十一万册。由“呐喊”、“彷徨”、“故事新编”三部短篇小说集合成的“鲁迅小说集”已经印行了九万多册。有很多的读者，包括远在朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军中的读者，经常给人民文学出版社来信，提出对于出版和注释鲁迅著作的要求和意见。
    人民文学出版社关于鲁迅著作的注释工作，还在慎重和周密地继续进行。这一工作预计到一九五四年底可以基本完成。从一九五五年起，人民文学出版社将出版附有注释的鲁迅著作的新的版本。继鲁迅的杂文、小说等著作之后，该社还将出版有简要注释的“鲁迅日记”。　（新华社）
