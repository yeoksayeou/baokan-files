Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Plant Heating Furnace Begins Ignition

[Report from this newspaper] Our country's first automated seamless steel tube plant began firing the furnace at 2:00 PM on October 20th. This is a signal that the Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Plant is striving to conduct hot test rolling and put into production ahead of schedule.

On the day the heating furnace was ignited and baked, the entire construction site of the seamless steel tube plant was filled with a tense and joyful atmosphere. Heating workers who had studied the furnace baking operating procedures were excited and arrived early for their shift. They quickly made all the preparations for baking the furnace, waiting for the order to ignite the furnace. Soviet experts and professional inspectors with various colored cloth symbols also arrived at the factory early and made a final inspection of the various equipment that had already been inspected many times. Hua Ming, Acting General Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and Zhang Yimin, Deputy Manager, also personally came to the construction site.

In the morning, personnel from various professional acceptance teams began to sign off on the acceptance of various equipment for the heating furnace. After the personnel from the last acceptance team—the gas equipment acceptance team—signed the handover form, Yang Fangren, Director of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, immediately reported to the company manager that the acceptance was completed and the furnace baking work was ready, and accepted the manager's instructions to approve the furnace baking. Immediately afterwards, Director Yang Fangren issued the order to ignite the furnace, and the heating workers, engineers, and technicians crawled nervously and orderly into the curved flue under the heating furnace. When a worker lit the oilcloth under the pile of firewood at the bottom of the chimney, the intensely burning oak wood burned fiercely. At this time, a burst of applause rang out in the flue; the staff working outside the factory building also excitedly looked up at the green smoke coming out of the chimney. After the chimney and flue were baked for about six hours, a raging fire was ignited in the heating furnace chamber. When this heating furnace is baked with firewood for several days to reach a certain temperature, gas will be sent into the furnace. When the temperature of the heating furnace rises to 800 or 900 degrees Celsius, the tube blanks can be loaded into the heating furnace to begin heating.

Now all the staff of the Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Plant are actively carrying out the final mechanical operation and adjustment, striving to quickly carry out hot test rolling and formally put into production.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, October 20th: The finishing work and acceptance work of the newly built seamless steel tube plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have achieved new progress. The heating furnace project, which is of great importance to the overall completion, has been repaired on the 19th; the furnace baking preparation work has been completed; the rolling mill and its auxiliary parts of the six major units have undergone "technical completion" acceptance.

In order to strive for completion on schedule or ahead of schedule, the mechanical installation workers building the seamless steel tube plant have carried out five days and four nights of intense work in succession when repairing the heating furnace recently. The heating furnace project has undergone strict technical appraisal and the quality is good. Soviet experts shook hands with the workers on the spot to congratulate them. At the same time, the heating furnace workers of the seamless steel tube plant have completed the preparation work for baking the furnace. The red record card recording the rise and fall of the furnace temperature, various tools, ignition and firewood, and other supplies have been placed in order along the edge of the heating furnace. The technicians in the instrument workshop have installed instruments for measuring low temperatures, and the instrument experts are patiently explaining various technical issues to the technicians in front of the operating table of the complex automatic instruments. The heating workers responsible for the heating furnace have all gone to work. A worker took out a red "Safety Operation Certificate" from his pocket and happily told reporters that it was issued to him after passing the exam. He said that participating in the furnace baking work of China's first seamless steel tube plant is a glorious task. He said: "For more than a year, I have been looking forward to baking the furnace every day, and now it is almost here."

On the morning of the same day, the construction site director, production plant director, manager of the mechanical installation engineering company, and Soviet experts responsible for mechanical installation, electrical, lubrication, and production, detailed the "technical completion" acceptance work of the automatic rolling mill and its auxiliary equipment. After a series of inspections of the main electrical room, oil depot, machinery, etc., the deputy chief commander of the test run issued the signal to start the machine. The worker on the operating table immediately turned on the button, and the huge machine slowly turned; as the speed of the motor increased, the pointer calculating the speed of the machine continued to move towards the high-speed index. At this time, Soviet experts constantly stroked the body temperature of certain parts of the machine; the workers put steel bars more than a foot long and as thick as soybeans on one end against the outside of the machine shaft and the other end into their ears, listening to and measuring the rolling condition of the balls inside the machine. After four hours of operation, the installation quality of the other parts of the automatic rolling mill unit was good except for one part that could be adjusted quickly. Prior to this, the unit had undergone nearly a month of adjustment and 52 hours of test operation. Now, the relevant personnel are sorting out the operating data of the unit in preparation for the "technical completion" acceptance signature.

    鞍钢无缝钢管厂加热炉开始点火
    【本报讯】我国第一座自动化无缝钢管厂，在十月二十日下午二时开始点火烘炉。这是鞍钢无缝钢管厂争取提前进行热试轧与投入生产的信号。
    加热炉点火烘炉的这一天，无缝钢管厂整个工地都充满着紧张和欢乐的气氛。曾经学习了烘炉操作规程的加热工人都怀着兴奋的心情，提早上了班。他们很快地作好了一切烘炉的准备工作，等待着点火烘炉的命令。苏联专家和带着各种色布符号的专业检查人员，很早也来到工厂，最后检查了早已作过多次检验的各种设备。鞍山钢铁公司代总经理华明和副经理张益民等都亲自来到了工地。
    上午，各专业验收小组的人员开始进行加热炉各种设备的验收签字。当最后一个验收小组——瓦斯设备验收小组的人员在交工单上签字后，无缝钢管厂厂长杨仿人立刻向公司经理报告了验收完毕和烘炉工作准备妥当，并接受了经理批准烘炉的指示。紧接着，杨仿人厂长发出了点火烘炉的命令，加热工人、工程师和技术员们匍匐着、紧张而有秩序地钻进加热炉地下弯曲的烟道。当一个工人点燃了烟囱底部木柴堆下的油布时，具有强烈燃烧力的柞木便猛烈地燃烧起来了。这时，烟道里响起了一阵鼓掌声；在厂房外面工作着的职工们，也都兴奋地仰望着烟囱里冒出的青烟。烟囱和烟道经过六小时左右的烘烤以后，加热炉炉腔内就燃起了熊熊的烈火。这个加热炉用木柴烘烤数日达到一定温度时，就将开始往炉内送瓦斯，等到加热炉的温度上升到八、九百度，那时管胚就可以装进加热炉开始加热了。
    现在鞍钢无缝钢管厂全体职工，正积极地进行最后一些机械的运转和调整，争取迅速进行热试轧和正式投入生产。
    【新华社鞍山二十日电】鞍山钢铁公司新建无缝钢管厂的收尾工程和验收工作获得新的进展。和全部竣工有着重大关系的加热炉工程，已在十九日修整完好；烘炉准备工作业已就绪；六大机组中的轧管机及其附属部件，已进行“技术竣工”验收。
    建设无缝钢管厂的机械安装工人们，为了争取按期或提前竣工，在最近修整加热炉时接连进行了五天四夜的紧张工作。加热炉工程经过严格的技术鉴定，质量良好。苏联专家当场同工人们握手祝贺。与此同时，无缝钢管厂加热炉的工人们，已把烘炉的准备工作进行完毕。记载炉温升降的红色记录牌、各种工具、引火和木柴等用品，已按次序摆在加热炉的边沿。计器车间的技术人员，已安装好了测量低温的仪表，计器专家在复杂的自动仪器的操作台前，耐心地向技术工人们解释技术上的各种问题。担负加热炉工作的加热工人们已全部上班。一个工人从自己口袋里拿出一个红色的“安全作业证”，高兴地对记者说，这是经过考试合格才发给他的。他表示参加中国第一个无缝钢管厂的烘炉工作，是一个光荣的任务。他说：“一年多来，天天盼望烘炉，现在可快盼到了。”
    同日上午，无缝钢管厂工地主任、生产厂长、机械安装工程公司经理和负责机械安装、电气、润滑、生产的苏联专家们，详细地布置了自动轧管机及其附属设备的“技术竣工”验收工作。经过对主电室、油库、机械等一系列的检查以后，试运转副总指挥发出了开车的信号，操作台上的工人立刻拧开电钮，巨大的机器慢慢地转动了；随着马达转动速度的增加，计算机器转动速度的指针，不断的向高速的指数移动。这时，苏联专家不时地抚摸着机器某些部件的体温；工人们把一尺多长的像大豆那样粗的钢条，一头顶着机器轴的外部，一头塞进自己的耳朵，听测着机器内部滚珠转动的状况。经过四小时的运转，除一个部件很快即可调整妥善外，自动轧管机组的其他部件的安装质量均良好。在此以前，该机组已经过近一个月的调整和五十二小时的试运转。现在，有关人员正整理该机组的运转资料，准备“技术竣工”验收签字。
