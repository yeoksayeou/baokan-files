    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 15th: Since the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," the US side has been actively deploying a large number of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee agents to intensify their illegal activities among the non-directly repatriated Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Since the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission took over the prisoners, the US side has used even more despicable means to continue directing the Chiang and Rhee agents mixed into the prisoner-of-war camp areas, undermining the supervision of the Indian custodial forces. With inhumane atrocities, they obstruct prisoners from applying for repatriation and conspire to sabotage the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese representatives. Regarding the US side's illegal actions, which seriously violate the Armistice Agreement and the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," Senior Colonel Li Sang-cho, the chief representative of the Korean and Chinese side to the Military Armistice Commission, lodged the most serious protest with the US side on October 14th, firmly demanding that the US side immediately cease these illegal activities and pointing out that the US side must bear full responsibility for all serious consequences arising therefrom.
    The main points of Senior Colonel Li Sang-cho's speech at the Military Armistice Commission on October 14th are as follows:
    For a long time, in order to achieve the goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, your side has dispatched a large number of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek agents to your prisoner-of-war camps, using all kinds of inhumane atrocities to force our captured personnel to tattoo themselves, write blood letters, and provide fingerprints to indicate their so-called "unwillingness to be repatriated." Your side's criminal conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war has been condemned by the people of the world, and our side has repeatedly lodged protests with your side. However, your side, disregarding our protests and the condemnation of the people of the world, has intensified your conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war after both sides signed the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the Armistice Agreement. Your side not only sent Colonel Hansen, the Far East head of the US military's Psychological Warfare Department, and Colonel Ochsner, the Tokyo head of the so-called CIE special agent organization, to Jeju Island to personally arrange matters together with Colonel Cummins, the US military police commander in Moseulpo, but also openly supported and assisted the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's special agent leaders Fang Zhi, Ni Wenya, and others, as well as the Syngman Rhee group's military police commander Won Yong-deok, in conducting coercive detention activities against our captured personnel.
    In order to prevent our captured personnel from expressing their desire to be repatriated, your side has, on the one hand, instructed Rhee and Chiang agents to forcibly re-tattoo the entire bodies of our captured personnel, with US military police supervising and inspecting the tattooing process, attempting to use this barbaric method to increase the fear of our captured personnel and achieve the goal of forced detention. On the other hand, your side has forcibly organized our captured personnel into battalions, companies, and squads, deploying agents to control them at every level, and organizing agents into so-called "core groups" and "guard teams" to monitor and kill our captured personnel who dare to demand repatriation. In addition to the Rhee and Chiang agents who had already been dispatched to your prisoner-of-war camps, your side has further dispatched a large number of Rhee and Chiang agents, disguised as our captured personnel, to infiltrate the Indian custodial areas to strengthen the terroristic rule over our captured personnel. A partial list of these agents, totaling 466 names, has been identified by our side and submitted to the Indian custodial forces of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, including Wang Shunqing, Wang Futian, and others who were given special agent training by your side in Tokyo in 1951.
    After our captured personnel were transferred to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, your side still used various methods to maintain contact with the Rhee and Chiang agents mixed in with our captured personnel in order to directly direct their activities. Your side used radios that had been issued to the agents in advance to transmit instructions to them. Your side used the prisoner-of-war hospital provided to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission as the general command post, arranging the activities of agents in each camp area. Your side used administrative personnel and staff to transmit messages to the agents within the camp area. Your side even used light signals and flag signals on Hill 155 in the area under your control to issue orders to the agents in the camp area. The "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" stipulate that the detaining side must completely relinquish its control and influence over the prisoners of war. Your side's actions of dispatching agents to maintain contact and instigate sabotage activities are a serious violation of the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission."
    Although our captured personnel have been transferred to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, they are, in fact, still under the extreme terroristic rule and oppression of your side's agents. "Guard teams" of agents are stationed everywhere in each camp area, and every action of our captured personnel is monitored. Your side's agents are constantly persecuting our captured personnel with various weapons brought into the camp area and manufactured within the camp area. Our captured personnel are beaten or killed as soon as they show any sign of demanding repatriation. For example, Zhang Zilong, a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Camp 28, was brutally beaten by agents for expressing his longing for the motherland and demanding repatriation when he resisted the agents' kidnapping of him for a demonstration on October 2nd. He was inhumanely cut open and his heart was dug out. Choi Si-yeol, a captured soldier of the Korean People's Army in Camp 44, was trampled to death by four agents for showing a slight indication of demanding repatriation. The inhumane atrocities committed by these agents under your side's direction far exceed the atrocities committed by the Nazis in concentration camps during World War II.
    The fact that your side instructed agents to commit atrocities against our captured personnel to prevent them from expressing their desire for repatriation has been confirmed by more than 120 of our captured personnel who have been repatriated to our side from the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission so far. Article 3 of the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" explicitly stipulates that force or the threat of force shall not be used against prisoners of war to obstruct or compel their repatriation, but the agents dispatched by your side are using inhumane violence to obstruct and suppress the repatriation aspirations of our captured personnel.
    In order to achieve the goal of forcibly detaining our captured personnel, your side has planned in advance and is continuing to direct agents to carry out activities to sabotage the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and to sabotage the explanation work. One week after the "Terms of Reference" were signed, your side sent the Far East head of the US military's Psychological Warfare Department and the Tokyo head of the so-called CIE special agent organization to your prisoner-of-war camps to force our captured personnel to practice how to disrupt the explanation work, threatening our captured personnel not to answer any questions from the explanation representatives, and arranging for agents mixed into the prisoner-of-war camp sites to beat and kill the explanation representatives and the personnel of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. On August 25th, Ge Tianmin, a translator for the US military police headquarters on Jeju Island, ordered agents above the battalion commander level: After the prisoners of war are handed over to the custody of the Indian custodial forces, the Indian army is not allowed to contact the prisoners of war; if the Indian army interferes, the Indian army's guns can be confiscated, and the Indian army can be killed if necessary. On August 26th, a lieutenant colonel from the US military police headquarters on Jeju Island and Ge Tianmin arranged for agents above the battalion commander level to organize assassination squads to assassinate our explanation representatives. Your side also distributed maps of the Indian custodial areas to the agents, with the locations of the camps, the defensive situation of the Indian army, and the positions of the three divisions of your US military and Syngman Rhee's army south of the camp, including the positions of artillery and tanks, as well as the markings of the airport, instructing them to abduct the prisoners of war and rush out of the camp at the appropriate time, and saying that the US military could respond at any time. Your South Korean government has even openly declared that it will attack the Indian custodial forces, attempting to collude with the agents mixed into the Indian custodial areas to create another so-called "collective escape" to rob our captured personnel.
    Hamblen, the head of your side's repatriation group, even openly proposed in a letter to Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, that prisoners of war could "collectively refuse to accept explanations," attempting to use the agent control that your side continues to maintain at the prisoner-of-war camp sites to deprive the prisoners of war of the right to hear explanations granted by the "Terms of Reference." At the same time, your side, disregarding the firm demands of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, has repeatedly delayed the construction of the explanation camp sites for our explanation representatives to use.
    Article 8 of the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" stipulates that after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission takes over all prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated, it shall immediately make arrangements to ensure that the countries to which the prisoners of war belong have the freedom and convenience to send representatives to explain their rights to all prisoners of war affiliated with that country within 90 days from the date of takeover by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. However, on the one hand, your side has done everything possible to obstruct the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission from making arrangements immediately after taking over the prisoners of war to ensure that the explanation work can be carried out; on the other hand, your side has groundlessly attempted to overturn the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's decision to extend the explanation period and guarantee 90 days of explanation work in accordance with the "Terms of Reference." These various illegal activities and claims completely expose your side's despicable conspiracy to sabotage the "Terms of Reference" and continue to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war.
    Regarding your side's above-mentioned various illegal actions that seriously violate the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and are aimed at forcibly detaining our captured personnel, I am instructed to lodge the most serious protest with your side. Your side must immediately cease all actions that sabotage custody and explanation and forcibly obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war. Your side must bear full responsibility for all serious consequences arising from these actions.

### 对美方破坏“职权范围”阻挠战俘遣返的行为  我方向美方提出严重抗议

    对美方破坏“职权范围”阻挠战俘遣返的行为
    我方向美方提出严重抗议
    【新华社开城十五日电】朝鲜停战协定与“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”签订以后，美方积极布置大批蒋介石和李承晚的特务，在不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员中变本加厉地进行非法活动。自从中立国遣返委员会接管战俘以后，美方更使用各种卑鄙手段，继续指挥混入战俘看管地区的蒋、李特务，破坏印度看管部队的看管，以灭绝人性的暴行，阻挠战俘申请遣返，并预谋破坏朝中代表的解释工作。对于美方这种严重破坏停战协定、“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的非法行为，军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将于十月十四日向美方提出最严重的抗议，坚决要求美方立即停止这些非法活动，并指出美方必须担负由此而产生的一切严重后果的完全责任。
    李相朝中将在十月十四日军事停战委员会上的主要发言，全文如下：
    长期以来，你方为了达到强迫扣留战俘的目的，派遣了大批李承晚和蒋介石的特务，在你方的战俘营中以种种惨无人道的暴行，来强迫我方被俘人员刺字、写血书、打指印，以表示所谓“不愿遣返”。你方这种强迫扣留战俘的罪恶阴谋，受到了全世界人民的谴责，我方并会一再向你方提出抗议。但你方不顾我方的抗议及全世界人民的谴责，竟在双方签订了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”及停战协定之后，变本加厉地进行你方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。你方不仅派遣了美军心理作战部远东负责人汉生上校及所谓CIE特务组织的东京负责人欧厦姆上校，到济州岛与摹瑟浦美军宪兵司令克明斯上校一起亲自进行布置，而且公开支持与协助蒋介石匪帮的特务首脑方治、倪文亚等以及李承晚集团的宪兵司令元容德等，对我方被俘人员进行胁迫扣留的活动。
    为了阻止我方被俘人员表达要求遣返的意志，你方一方面指使李、蒋特务强迫在我方被俘人员的全身重新刺字，并由美军宪兵在刺字时进行监督与检查，企图用这种野蛮的方法增加我方被俘人员的疑惧，达到强迫扣留的目的。另一方面，你方将我方被俘人员强迫编成大队、中队、小队，布置特务层层控制，并将特务组织成所谓“核心小组”、“警备队”等，来监视并杀害敢于要求遣返的我方被俘人员。除了早已被派在你方战俘营中的李、蒋特务以外，你方更增派大批李、蒋特务冒充我方被俘人员混入印度看管地区，以加强对我方被俘人员的恐怖统治。这些特务的部分名单共四百六十六名，经我方查明后已提交给中立国遣返委员会印度看管部队，其中如王顺清、王福田等都曾于一九五一年在东京由你方予以特务训练。
    在我方被俘人员被移交中立国遣返委员会看管后，你方仍用各种方法与混在我方被俘人员中的李、蒋特务保持联系，以直接指挥他们的活动。你方利用事前发给特务的收音机，向他们传达指示。你方将提供中立国遣返委员会的战俘医院作为总指挥所，布置各营场内的特务活动。你方利用行政人员及工作人员为营场内的特务传递消息。你方更在你方控制地区内的一五五高地上用灯光信号和旗语向营场内的特务发布命令。“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”规定：原拘留一方必须完全解除其对战俘的控制与影响，你方派遣特务保持联系、策动破坏活动的行为，是对“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的严重违反。
    我方被俘人员虽已被移交中立国遣返委员会看管，但事实上仍然处于你方特务的极度恐怖的统治与压迫之下。各营场内到处有特务“警备队”站岗放哨，我方被俘人员的每一个行动都受到监视。你方特务用带进营场的以及在营场内制造的各种武器，不断地对我方被俘人员进行迫害。我方被俘人员只要稍有要求遣返的表示，就被毒打或杀害。例如，二十八号营场的中国人民志愿军被俘人员张子龙，在十月二日反抗特务挟持进行的示威游行时表示怀念祖国要求遣返的愿望，就遭特务毒打，惨无人道地被剖胸挖出心脏。四十四号营场的朝鲜人民军被俘人员崔四烈，因为稍有要求遣返的表示，就被四名特务践踏而死。这些特务在你方指挥下所进行的灭绝人性的暴行，远超过二次大战中纳粹在集中营中所进行的暴行。
    你方指使特务对我方被俘人员施以暴行，以阻止他们表达要求遣返的意志的事实，已经由迄今自中立国遣返委员会看管下遣返我方的一百二十余名我方被俘人员所证实。“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第三款明确规定，不得对战俘使用武力或以武力威胁以阻挠或强使其遣返，而你方所派遣的特务却正以灭绝人性的暴力，阻挠和压制我方被俘人员的遣返愿望。
    为了达到强迫扣留我方被俘人员的目的，你方事先筹划并正继续指挥特务进行破坏中立国遣返委员会的看管和破坏解释工作的活动。在“职权范围”签订后一星期，你方就派遣了美军心理作战部远东负责人及所谓CIE特务组织的东京负责人，到你方战俘营中强迫我方被俘人员演习了如何破坏解释工作的方法，威胁我方被俘人员不得回答解释代表的任何问题，布置混入战俘看管地点的特务殴打、杀害解释代表和中立国遣返委员会的人员。八月二十五日，济州岛美军宪兵司令部翻译葛天民，曾命令大队长以上特务：在战俘移交印度看管部队看管后，不许印军与战俘接触；如印军干涉，可缴印军的枪，必要时可打死印军。八月二十六日，济州岛美军宪兵司令部一名中校又偕葛天民向大队长以上的特务布置组织暗杀团，以暗杀我方解释代表。你方更向特务散发印度看管地区的地图，上标有营场位置、印军设防情况以及营场南你方美军及李承晚军队三个师的阵地，包括大炮与坦克阵地以及飞机场的记号，要他们在适当时机挟持战俘冲出营场，并说美军可随时接应。你方南朝鲜政府更公开扬言将袭击印度看管部队，企图与混入印度看管地区的特务里应外合，又一次制造所谓“集体逃亡”，以劫夺我方被俘人员。
    你方遣返组组长汉布伦在致中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将的信中，更公开提出战俘可以“集体拒绝接受解释”，企图利用你方在战俘看管地点所继续保持的特务控制，剥夺“职权范围”赋予战俘的听取解释的权利。与此同时，你方又不顾中立国遣返委员会的坚决要求，一再拖延修建供我方解释代表使用的解释营场。
    “中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第八款规定，中立国遣返委员会在接管全部未行使其被遣返权利的战俘之后，应立即进行安排，使战俘所属国家有自由与便利，在自中立国遣返委员会接管之日起的九十天内派出代表，向一切依附于该所属国家的战俘解释他们的权利。但你方一面百般阻挠，使中立国遣返委员会不能在接管战俘后立即作出安排使解释工作得以进行；另一方面又毫无理由地企图推翻中立国遣返委员会顺延解释期限、按照“职权范围”保证九十天的解释工作的决定。这种种非法活动与主张，完全暴露了你方破坏“职权范围”、继续阻挠战俘遣返的卑鄙阴谋。
    对于你方上述各种严重破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”、旨在强迫扣留我方被俘人员的非法行动，我奉命向你方提出最严重的抗议。你方必须立即停止破坏看管与解释、以强力阻挠战俘遣返的各种行动。由于这些行动所产生的一切严重后果，必须由你方完全负担。
