Great Founder and Mentor
——Commemorating the Seventeenth Anniversary of Lu Xun's Death
Feng Xuefeng

Studying Lu Xun's thought and literary heritage, and inheriting his revolutionary spirit and creative tradition: this remains a difficult learning task for our literary circles today.

Lu Xun is one of the great masters of 20th-century world realist literature, and also the great pioneer of Chinese socialist realist literature. We have not yet sufficiently researched Lu Xun's thought and literary heritage, and we still lack a deep understanding of it. In the far from sufficient research, our methods are often wrong, and our attitudes are often not correct enough. Sometimes we are only satisfied with quoting his words and phrases out of context, and we have not further conducted in-depth and comprehensive research; sometimes we adopt the pedantic methods of Confucian scholars, forgetting the grasp of Lu Xun's fundamental spirit. The worst is the very un謙虛 attitude that comes from our insufficient research and understanding.

For example, in the study of the development of Lu Xun's thought, especially when discussing his realism, our prejudices are very obvious. Some do not look at it from a developmental point of view, believing that Lu Xun was already a Marxist in thought and a socialist realist in literature when he wrote his "Diary of a Madman." If someone does not say this, they think that this is denying Lu Xun's greatness and insulting Lu Xun. Conversely, there is another prejudice that the great struggle, revolutionary thought, and literary works of Lu Xun before he became a Marxist and a socialist realist are not worthy of our attention and study. These prejudices are all manifestations of our too little research and insufficient modesty.

Today, the task of our literature serving the creative cause of the people is unprecedentedly heavy. The arduous task of the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation has been placed on the shoulders of the working class and the entire people, and also on the shoulders of literary workers. The requirements for the creation of socialist realist literature have also been raised to an unprecedented level. Therefore, learning from Lu Xun and inheriting his literary cause is even more important.

It is right to learn from Lu Xun's literary heritage, especially his realism. Therefore, it is also right to study the development of his thought and the development of his realism. But we cannot harbor prejudices, especially we cannot make empty judgments divorced from the actual development of the Chinese people's revolution reflected in Lu Xun's thoughts and works, nor can we abstractly talk about his realism apart from the content of Lu Xun's works. Because the greatest value of Lu Xun's works and the foundation of his realism lie in his reflection of the reality of the Chinese people's revolution; the development of his thought reflects the development of the Chinese people's revolution.

If we acknowledge that Lu Xun's brilliant realist works, whether his early or late (if we adopt such a saying), all reflect the reality of the Chinese people's revolution, then all his works should be valued and studied. If, because of studying the development of his thought, we adopt the saying of early and late periods, which produces prejudices that belittle his early works, thought, and realism, or deny the great significance of the development of his thought, then we are divorced from the reality of the problem, which is harmful to our learning.

In the study of the development of Lu Xun's thought, and in the study of the development of his realism, based on the essence of the thought and the historical conditions, roughly dividing him into the early period—revolutionary democrat, and the late period—Marxist, with 1927 as the dividing line, to explain the significance of his development, I think is acceptable. Because Lu Xun is inseparable from the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, his genius's growth and development are inextricably linked with the history of the people's revolution. Since the development of his thought reflects the history of the development of the people's revolution, the above rough division is also in line with historical facts, and at the same time, it is convenient for research work.

Of course, we should learn to use the scientific analytical methods of Marxism, and should not fall into the pedantry of Confucian scholars. Especially important is that we should not only value Lu Xun's late period, but also value his early period equally. We must adopt the same respectful attitude as Lenin towards Chernyshevsky and others. Chairman Mao's analysis and evaluation of Lu Xun are the criteria that we must follow when studying and learning from Lu Xun.

Before becoming a Marxist, Lu Xun was the most brilliant revolutionary democrat in China, unprecedented in history. This is the greatest basis for us to learn from and inherit his early thoughts and literary works.

Lu Xun was a great literary genius; but one of the greatest characteristics of this genius is that he was also a great revolutionary and a great thinker. In China, before the Marxists, such thorough revolutionary thought as Lu Xun's, such a spirit of never compromising with feudalism and imperialism, such sharp eyes, penetrating history and society, boldly exposing the truth of life, such a spirit of forever opposing the old and dying things and forever supporting the revolutionary new forces, had indeed not been seen. The immortal brilliance of Lu Xun's works and the characteristics of his realism originated from this. Lu Xun's great revolutionary thought and fighting spirit are reflected in his literary works. He engaged in creation for the sake of revolution, and the purpose of his creation was to use literature as a powerful tool for the enlightenment, education, and encouragement of the people's revolution. In Lu Xun's view, literature is a revolutionary weapon, and realism is a necessary method for creating this weapon. For the needs of the revolution, literature must "open its eyes and face squarely" at the real society, must boldly dissect society and history, boldly expose social contradictions and struggles, must hate and attack all zombies and dark forces with the deepest disgust, must soberly point out the strength of the people, the development of life, and the way out of the revolution, and must enthusiastically encourage the people to fight for a new ideal society.

We cannot look at Lu Xun's literary works apart from his revolutionary thought and spirit; we cannot study his realism apart from the people's revolutionary struggle reflected in his works. Works such as "Call to Arms," "Wandering," and the large number of political essays (miscellaneous essays) written during the same period, like all his later works, are forever the treasure of the Chinese people and forever the model for our creation. The realism expressed in these works is indeed the most brilliant, and indeed must be learned, inherited, and developed by us. Our socialist realism should develop from here, and in fact cannot but develop from here; Lu Xun's own later socialist realism is the development of his early realism.

From the perspective of creative methods, in order for our creation to have high achievements, we indeed cannot but study and read "Call to Arms," "Wandering," and Lu Xun's other works. The profound dissection, deadly satire, and merciless criticism that are present in all of Lu Xun's works are what we must inherit, learn from, and develop. His revolutionary patriotism and his infinitely deep love for the people and revolutionary humanism are what we must learn, inherit, and develop. Lu Xun's most wonderful typicalization method of creating artistic images is what we must learn from and develop. Lu Xun lived in the old China ruled by reactionary forces, so he mainly focused on exposing, criticizing, and describing the dark forces, social diseases, and the so-called gray life of the people; however, the sparks of Lu Xun's revolutionary thought still danced above the so-called gray life. To say that Lu Xun's works only depict gray and negative characters is not only inconsistent with the facts for his later works, but also inconsistent with the facts for his early works. For example, the madman in "Diary of a Madman," Xia Yu in "Medicine," and the madman in "The Eternal Lamp," what else are they if not unyielding warriors and heroes in the democratic revolution against feudalism? For Ah Q, the typical of "spiritual victory method" as the object of criticism, Lu Xun still saw his resistance; for Xiang Lin's Wife, who was harmed and ignorant, Lu Xun also described her as a doubter and resister of fate. In his miscellaneous essays, there are more descriptions of the heroic posture of patriotic men of lofty ideals and revolutionary warriors. Lu Xun's early works, precisely because they are realistic, also reflect the heroes of the people and the ideals of the revolution. As for his later miscellaneous essays, such reflections are even more distinct.

We are socialist realists, or rather, we are striving to become socialist realists. In this way, socialist realist works are even closer to us. But we must learn from all classical literary heritage; Lu Xun's works are especially must-learn. For us, not only his later period is close, but his early period is also close. Our socialist realism not only develops from his later works, but also develops from his early works.

But if we deny the development of Lu Xun's thought, or deny the difference between Lu Xun's later socialist realism and his early general so-called critical realism, then that is certainly also wrong.

Lu Xun's development from revolutionary democracy to Marxism was a great leap forward for Lu Xun himself, and it was a major event that shook the Chinese intellectual circles at that time. How can we deny this development and the significance of this development? As everyone already knows, the reason why Lu Xun developed from a revolutionary democrat to a Marxist is because his early thoughts were indeed thoroughly revolutionary, and his opposition to feudalism and imperialism was uncompromising and incomparably fierce, as mentioned above. Moreover, it was also because his struggle was also called and promoted by the October Revolution, and he was fighting in the era of the world proletarian revolution, and he was also directly influenced and led by the Chinese proletariat domestically; he had already formed a close alliance with the Communists in the early period. The historical era in which Lu Xun lived shows that Lu Xun's early revolutionary democratic thought also developed to its most brilliant extent under the leadership and influence of the proletariat. However, Lu Xun truly became a Marxist in terms of his worldview and understanding of the real revolution, and there is a more important reason, that is, the manifestation of the growing strength of the workers and peasants in the First Domestic Revolutionary War from 1924 to 1927, the factual lessons of the Kuomintang's betrayal of the revolution in 1927, and Lu Xun's own profound research on Marxism. These are historical facts that everyone already knows, and there is no need to elaborate on them now.

Lu Xun used literature as a tool for revolutionary struggle. Since he became a Marxist in thought, it was very natural for him to become a socialist realist in literature at the same time.

But there are differences between Lu Xun as a revolutionary democrat and Lu Xun as a Marxist. From the essence of thought, there are essential differences between the two. Because such development, not only from the relationship of inheritance, has differences like mother and daughter; but mainly the difference in worldview, the difference in class stand, and the difference in the era task served by literature. This essential difference comes from the essential difference between revolutionary democracy and Marxism. This great development in thought is most vividly reflected in his later works. The brilliance of the truth of Marxism and the flames of the victorious advance of the Chinese people's revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party are the brilliant characteristics of Lu Xun's later works.

In his later period, Lu Xun laid the first cornerstone of Chinese socialist realist literature with his most profound and magnificent nearly ten volumes of miscellaneous essays, and opened up its long-term road. These miscellaneous essays are political essays, and at the same time, they are artistic creations.

In the cultivation and leadership of literature serving the working class and all working people, Lu Xun is a great nanny and mentor. Deeply and fully studying Lu Xun's thought and entire literary heritage, inheriting and developing him, is a work that we must vigorously carry out in the new literary creation project.

    伟大的奠基者和导师
    ——纪念鲁迅逝世十七周年
    冯雪峰
    研究鲁迅的思想和文学遗产，继承他的革命精神和创作传统：这在今天仍然是我们的文学界的艰巨的学习任务。
    鲁迅是二十世纪世界现实主义文学的大师之一，也是中国社会主义现实主义文学的伟大的开路人。我们对于鲁迅的思想和文学遗产，还没有充分的研究，还缺乏深刻的了解。在远远不够的研究中，我们的方法又常常有错误，我们的态度也常常不够正确。有时我们只满足于断章取义地引用他的片言只语，并没有进一步去作深入的全面的研究；有时我们又采取了腐儒式的烦琐主义的方法，而忘记了鲁迅的根本精神的掌握。最坏的，是由于我们研究不够、认识不够而来的很不虚心的态度。
    例如在研究鲁迅思想的发展，尤其在谈到他的现实主义问题的时候，我们的偏见是很明显的。有的是不从发展的观点上去看，认为鲁迅在写他的“狂人日记”的时候，在思想上就已经是一个马克思主义者，在文学上也已经是一个社会主义现实主义者。如果有人不这样说，就认为这是否定了鲁迅的伟大，侮辱了鲁迅。与此相反，也有另一种偏见，认为鲁迅在成为马克思主义者和社会主义现实主义者以前的伟大战斗、革命思想和文学作品，都不值得我们重视和学习。这些偏见，都是我们太少研究和不够虚心的表现。
    在今天，我们的文学为人民的创造事业服务的任务，是空前地加重了。国家的社会主义的工业化和社会主义的改造的艰巨任务，已经放在工人阶级和全体人民的肩上，也放在文学工作者的肩上。社会主义现实主义文学的创造的要求也空前地提高了。因此，学习鲁迅，继承他的文学事业，也更为重要了。
    学习鲁迅的文学遗产，特别要学习他的现实主义，这是对的。因此，也要研究他的思想的发展，他的现实主义的发展，这也是对的。但我们不能存偏见，尤其不能脱离鲁迅的思想和作品所反映的中国人民革命发展的实际去作空泛的论断，也不能离开鲁迅作品的内容去抽象地谈论他的现实主义。因为鲁迅作品的最伟大的价值和他的现实主义的基础，是在于他反映了中国人民革命的实际；他的思想的发展反映了中国人民革命的发展。
    如果我们承认鲁迅的辉煌的现实主义的作品，不论他的前期和后期（如果我们采取这样的说法），都是反映了中国人民革命的实际，那么，他的全部作品，我们都应该重视，都应该学习。如果因为研究他的思想的发展而采取前期后期的说法，就产生轻视他的前期的作品、思想和现实主义的偏见，或者就否定了他思想发展的伟大意义，那都是脱离了问题的实际，对于我们的学习是有害的。
    在关于鲁迅思想发展的研究上，在关于他的现实主义的发展的研究上，根据思想的实质和历史的条件，大概地以一九二七年为界线，把他分为前期——革命民主主义者，和后期——马克思主义者，以说明他的发展的意义，我以为是可以的。因为鲁迅既然和中国人民革命斗争不可分离，他的天才的成长和发展都跟人民革命的发展历史血脉相连。他的思想的发展既然反映了人民革命的发展历史，那么，上述的大概的分法也是合于历史事实的，同时对于研究工作也是有方便的。
    自然，我们应该学习运用马克思主义的科学分析方法，而不应该堕入腐儒式的烦琐主义里去。尤其重要的，我们不仅应该重视鲁迅的后期，而且应该同样重视他的前期。我们必须采取像列宁对于车尔尼雪夫斯基等人的那样尊崇的态度。毛主席对于鲁迅的分析和评价，是我们研究和学习鲁迅的时候所必须遵照的准则。
    鲁迅在他成为一个马克思主义者以前，是一个在中国前无古人的最辉煌的革命民主主义者。这就是我们必须学习和继承他前期的思想和文学作品的最大的根据。
    鲁迅是一个伟大的文学天才；但这个天才的一个最大的特点，是他同时是伟大的革命家和伟大的思想家。在中国，在马克思主义者以前，像鲁迅那样的彻底的革命思想，像他那样和封建主义和帝国主义永远不妥协的精神，像他那样眼光尖利，深入历史和社会，大胆地揭发生活的真实，像他那样永远反对旧的垂死的事物和永远支持革命的新生的力量的精神，确是没有看见过的。鲁迅作品的不朽的光辉及其现实主义的特色，就是从这里产生的。鲁迅的这种伟大的革命思想和战斗精神，都反映在他的文学作品上。他是为了革命而从事创作的，他从事创作的目的是要用文学来做人民革命的启蒙、教育和鼓舞的有力工具。在鲁迅，文学是革命的战斗武器，而现实主义是创造这种武器的必要方法。为了革命的需要，所以文学必须“睁眼正视”现实的社会，必须大胆地解剖社会和历史，大胆地揭露社会的矛盾与斗争，必须以最深的憎恶去痛恨和打击一切的僵尸和黑暗势力，必须清醒地指出人民的力量、生活的发展和革命的出路，必须热烈地鼓舞人民为新的理想的社会而战斗。
    不能离开鲁迅的革命思想和精神去看他的文学作品；不能离开他的作品所反映的人民革命斗争去研究他的现实主义。像“呐喊”、“彷徨”以及同时期所写的大量的政论性的艺术散文（杂文），和他后期的一切作品一样，永远都是中国人民的财宝，永远都是我们创作的典范。在这些作品中所表现的现实主义，的确是最辉煌的，的确是我们非学习、继承和发展不可的。我们的社会主义现实主义应该从这里发展出来，事实上也不能不从这里发展出来；鲁迅自己后期的社会主义现实主义就是他前期的现实主义的发展。
    从创作的方法上说，为了我们的创作有高度的成就，的确不能不研究和熟读“呐喊”、“彷徨”以及鲁迅的其它作品。像鲁迅一切作品中所具有的那种深刻的解剖、对敌人的致命的讽刺和无情的批判，是我们必须继承、师法和发展的。他的革命的爱国主义以及对于人民的无限地深厚的爱和革命的人道主义，是我们必须学习、继承和发展的。鲁迅创造艺术形象的最高妙的典型化方法，是我们必须师法和发展的。鲁迅生活在反动势力统治着的旧中国，所以他主要地用力于黑暗的势力、社会的病症和人民的所谓灰色生活的揭发、批评和描写；然而鲁迅的革命思想的火星仍然在所谓灰色生活的上面飞舞着。如果说鲁迅的作品只描写了灰色的和反面的人物，那是不但对他后期作品来说是不合事实的，即对他前期作品来说也是不合事实的。例如“狂人日记”中的狂人，“药”中的夏瑜，“长明灯”中的疯子，不是反封建主义的民主革命中的不屈的战士和英雄，又是什么人物呢？对于作为批判的对象——“精神胜利法”者的典型的阿Q，鲁迅依然看见他的反抗性；对于被损害的愚昧无知的祥林嫂，鲁迅也是作为一个对于运命的怀疑者和反抗者来描写的。在他的杂文中，爱国志士和革命战士的英勇姿态，还有更多的描写。鲁迅前期的作品，正因为是现实主义的，所以也反映了人民的英雄和革命的理想。至于他后期的杂文，这样的反映就更为鲜明。
    我们是社会主义现实主义者，或者说，是要努力成为社会主义现实主义者。这样，社会主义现实主义的作品对于我们也就更为亲近。但我们是必须学习一切古典文学遗产的；鲁迅的作品是尤其必须学习的。鲁迅对于我们，不仅后期是亲近的，他的前期也是亲近的。我们的社会主义现实主义不仅是从他后期的作品发展而来，并且也是从他前期的作品发展而来的。
    但我们如果否定了鲁迅思想的发展，或者否定了鲁迅后期的社会主义现实主义和他前期的一般所说的批判的现实主义的区别，那当然也是不对的。
    鲁迅从革命民主主义发展到马克思主义，在鲁迅自己是一个伟大的跃进，在当时是震动中国思想界的一件大事情。我们怎么能够否定这个发展和这个发展的意义呢？如大家已经知道，鲁迅所以会从革命民主主义者发展为马克思主义者，是因为他前期的思想确实是彻底地革命的，他的反对封建主义和帝国主义是丝毫不妥协的、无比地猛烈的，如上面所说。而且，还因为他的战斗也是受着十月革命的号召与推动的，他是战斗在世界无产阶级革命的时代，而在国内还直接受着中国无产阶级的领导与影响；他在前期也已经和共产党人结为亲密的同盟。鲁迅所处的历史时代，说明着鲁迅前期的革命民主主义思想也是在无产阶级的领导与影响之下发展到最辉煌的程度的。但鲁迅在宇宙观上和现实革命的认识上真正成为一个马克思主义者，却还有其更重要的原因，这就是在一九二四——一九二七年第一次国内革命战争中工农群众力量的壮大的表现，一九二七年国民党的叛变革命的事实教训，以及鲁迅自己对于马克思主义的深刻的研究。这是大家都已经知道的历史事实，现在也用不到详说了。
    鲁迅是以文学作为革命斗争的工具的。他既然在思想上成为一个马克思主义者，那么同时在文学上成为一个社会主义现实主义者，那是很自然的事情。
    但作为革命民主主义者的鲁迅和作为马克思主义者的鲁迅，是有区别的。从思想的实质上说，二者是有着本质上的区别的。因为这样的发展，不仅从继承的关系上说，有着好比母亲和女儿的不同；而且主要的是宇宙观的不同，阶级立场的不同，文学所服务的时代任务的不同。这个本质上的区别，是从革命民主主义和马克思主义在实质上的不同而来的。这个思想上的伟大发展，最鲜明地反映在他后期的作品上。马克思主义的真理的光辉和中国共产党所领导的中国人民革命胜利前进的火焰，是鲁迅在后期作品上所具有的灿烂的特色。
    鲁迅在后期，以他的最深刻、最壮美的近十本的杂文，奠下了中国社会主义现实主义文学的最初的一块基石，开辟了它的远大的道路。这些杂文是政论，同时又是艺术创作。
    在为工人阶级和全体劳动人民服务的文学的培养和领导上，鲁迅是一个伟大的保姆和导师。深刻地、充分地研究鲁迅的思想和全部文学遗产，继承和发展他，这是我们在新的文学创造工程上必须大力进行的工作。
