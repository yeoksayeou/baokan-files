    I represent the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in congratulating the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce on the convening of its Members' Representative Conference.
    In the four years since liberation, workers in private industrial and commercial enterprises, like workers in state-owned enterprises, have been working hard to develop production and prosper the economy. They have not adopted an irresponsible attitude towards private enterprises simply because they are capitalist in nature. Why is this? Because the working class, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, understands that developing production and prospering the economy are in the best interests of our People's Republic of China, and also in the greatest and most long-term interests of the Chinese working class itself. The interests of the People's Republic of China – this is the guiding principle of our trade union work.
    The interests of the motherland and the people are the greatest and most long-term interests of the working class, and also the greatest and most long-term interests of industrialists and businessmen. Gentlemen, our work is not just for ourselves, but more importantly for future generations. Although the bourgeoisie will eventually be eliminated, the descendants of the bourgeoisie will also live a better socialist and communist life. Therefore, industrialization and socialist transformation are not only in the long-term interests of the working class, but also in the long-term interests of all the people. This is the basis of our unity. Our labor-capital relations here must be built on this basis of the common interests of the motherland and the people. Therefore, we must examine all aspects of labor-capital relations from this common interest, and we must promote whatever conforms to the common interests of the motherland and the people, and we must correct whatever violates this common interest.
    During the period of national economic recovery, especially after the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" social transformation movement that changed customs and habits, private industry and commerce have undergone great transformation. The "Three Evils" and "Five Poisons" left over from the old society that hindered social progress have been largely eliminated, and the number of conscious industrialists and businessmen is increasing day by day. This has prepared the conditions for the further socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce through the path of state capitalism.
    After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, trade union organizations in many places have taken the initiative to assist the capitalists in improving business management, signing collective labor-capital contracts, and some factories have also launched labor competitions, promoted advanced production experience, and improved labor productivity. The capitalists have obtained legitimate profits, and the welfare facilities for employees have also been improved. This good phenomenon is common in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Wuhan, Chongqing, and other cities. Representatives from various regions will confirm this. These good experiences should be promoted by both labor and capital in the future. The trade union will continue to promote these experiences in a comprehensive manner. I hope that all representatives will also vigorously promote these experiences among industrialists and businessmen.
    One point worth mentioning is that private enterprises have shown a new atmosphere after the implementation of joint state-private ownership. For example, after the joint state-private ownership of Minsheng Company and Yongli Chemical Industry Company, the enthusiasm of the employees has been unprecedentedly improved, business management has been greatly improved, and the production process and technical equipment have also been greatly improved, and they are learning from advanced state-owned enterprises in all aspects. This has turned previously unprofitable or less profitable enterprises into profitable or more profitable enterprises. This shows that this is the correct path to greatly improve the productivity of private enterprises at present, and it is very beneficial to both the public and private sectors, and to both labor and capital. The workers welcome industrialists and businessmen to embark on this bright road, although it is a gradual process, but after all, such a bright road has been placed before us.
    In addition, at such a grand meeting of industrialists and businessmen, I should not conceal certain problems between labor and capital. From the perspective of the capitalists, after the "Five-Anti" movement, some industrialists and businessmen still took improper retaliatory measures against employees, or violated national policies and laws, and repeated the "Five Poisons." Their adoption of this erroneous attitude not only prevented their enterprises from improving, but also undermined the legitimate and reasonable public-private relations and labor-capital relations. The trade union organization, of course, has the responsibility to educate the employees and carry out necessary struggles and reasonable supervision against this erroneous attitude. I think that for the sake of the interests of the country and the people, and for the sake of correcting the legitimate and reasonable public-private relations and labor-capital relations, this necessary struggle and reasonable supervision can be agreed and assisted by all representatives and the Federation of Industry and Commerce.
    From the labor side, trade union work in private industrial and commercial enterprises is not without shortcomings, there are shortcomings in the work, and some trade union cadres also have errors in the implementation of policies. Trade union organizations at all levels are working hard to overcome these shortcomings and errors. For example, after the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Trade Union, trade union organizations throughout the country, whether in state-owned or private enterprises, universally educated employees on consolidating labor discipline and opposing economism, which are concrete measures to improve work and overcome errors and shortcomings. Of course, our work is still far from enough, and we will make more efforts to assist the capitalists in improving business management, improving operating conditions, increasing production, improving quality, and reducing costs. In private commerce, we will strive to establish new commercial ethics and promote the exchange of materials.
    Gentlemen, our great motherland has entered a great new historical period, and the general line of the state's transition period planned by Chairman Mao is illuminating our path to a bright and splendid future. I hope that we all move forward in accordance with the general line of the state to welcome the greater future of our motherland.

    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚的致词（摘要）
    我代表中华全国总工会祝贺中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会的召开。
    在解放以来的四年当中，私营工商企业中的工人和在国营企业中的工人一样，也一直在努力地发展生产、繁荣经济。他们并没有因为私营企业是资本主义性质的企业而对于它（私营企业）采取不负责任的态度。为什么是这样呢？因为工人阶级在毛主席和中国共产党的领导之下，懂得发展生产、繁荣经济是我们中华人民共和国的最大利益，也是中国工人阶级自己最大的最长远的利益。中华人民共和国的利益——这便是我们工会工作的准则。
    祖国和人民的利益，是工人阶级最大的最长远的利益，也是工商业者最大的最长远的利益。各位先生，我们的工作并不仅仅是为了我们自己，更重要的是为了后代子孙。将来资产阶级虽然要消灭，但是资产阶级的后代子孙也将要过着更美好的社会主义共产主义的生活。所以工业化和社会主义改造绝不单是工人阶级的长远利益，同时是全体人民的长远利益。这是我们联合的基础。我们这里的劳资关系必须建筑在这个祖国和人民的共同利益的基础上。因此，我们对于劳资关系的各个方面都必须从这种共同利益来加以考察，凡是合乎祖国和人民的共同利益的，就必须加以发扬，凡是违反这种共同利益的，就必须加以纠正。
    在国民经济恢复时期，特别是经过伟大的“三反”、“五反”这一移风易俗的社会改造运动之后，私营工商业已经有了很大的改造，那些旧社会所遗留下来的阻碍社会前进的“三害”、“五毒”，已被大量消除，有觉悟的工商业者日益增多。这就为资本主义工商业进一步地通过国家资本主义的道路而达到社会主义改造准备了条件。
    “三反”、“五反”以后，各地很多工会组织主动地通过协商方式，协助资方改善经营管理，签订劳资集体合同，部分工厂还开展了劳动竞赛，推广先进的生产经验，提高了劳动生产率，资方获得了合法的利润，职工的生活福利设施也有所改善。这种好现象在上海、天津、北京、武汉、重庆以及其他城市都是不少的。各地区来的代表先生们将会证实这一点。这些好的经验是今后劳资双方都应该努力推行的。工会将继续全面推广这些经验。希望各位代表先生在工商业者中间也大力推广这些经验。
    有一点值得特别提一下，就是私营企业在实现公私合营以后，表现了新的气象。如民生公司和永利化学工业公司，在公私合营之后，职工群众的积极性空前提高了，经营管理大大改善了，生产过程和技术设备也有了很大的改进，正从各方面向先进的国营企业看齐。这就使过去不赢利或赢利较少的企业变为赢利或赢利较大的企业了。这就说明了：这是目前促使私营企业把生产力大大提高一步的正确道路，而对于公私双方和劳资双方都是很有好处的。工人群众很欢迎工商业者走上这个光明的道路，虽然是要逐步地走，可是毕竟已经有这样一条光明的道路摆在我们的面前了。
    此外，在这样一个工商业者的盛大的会议上，我不应该隐讳劳资之间的某些问题。从资方来说，在“五反”运动之后，也还有一些工商业者对于职工采取了不应有的报复手段，或违反国家政策法令、重犯“五毒”。他们采取了这种错误的态度，不只是使他们的企业不能改善，而且也破坏了合法合理的公私关系和劳资关系。工会组织当然有责任教育职工群众，对于这种错误的态度进行必要的斗争和合理的监督。我想，为了国家和人民的利益，为了端正合法合理的公私关系和劳资关系，这种必要的斗争和合理的监督是能够得到各位代表先生和工商联的赞同与协助的。
    从劳方来说，私营工商企业中工会工作也并不是没有缺点的，工作上的缺点是有的，某些工会干部在执行政策上的错误也是有的。对于这些缺点和错误，工会各级组织都在努力克服。例如在中国工会第七次全国代表大会以后，在全国范围内无论在国营或私营企业中，工会组织对职工群众普遍地进行了关于巩固劳动纪律的教育，反对经济主义倾向的教育，这就是改进工作、克服错误和缺点的具体措施。当然，我们的工作还是很不够的，我们将以更多的努力协助资方改善经营管理，改善操作条件，增加生产，提高质量，降低成本。在私营商业中，将努力树立新的商业道德，促进物资交流。
    各位先生，我们的伟大祖国已经进入了一个伟大的新的历史时期，毛主席所规划的国家过渡时期的总路线，正在照耀着我们走向光明灿烂的前途。希望我们大家都按照国家的总路线前进，来迎接我们祖国的更伟大的将来。
