    On the Kukseke Pasture
    By our reporter Zhu Bo
    Kukseke Pasture is the summer pasture for the herders of the first, second, and third townships of the third district of Tekes County, and the scenery is very beautiful. Standing on the peak of Mount Adentao, you can see a panoramic view of the pasture: the towering rocks, the deep valleys, the quiet fir forests, and the mirror-like river water; the green carpet-like ground, setting off the white tents and the slowly rolling herds. In the distance, against the azure background, stand the snow-capped mountains that never melt. In this picturesque place, our fraternal Kirgiz compatriots are building their new life.
    Most of the herders on the pasture belong to the Kirgiz ethnic group, with a total of more than 900 households and more than 5,000 people. Some of them were moved from the deep mountains on the border after liberation. When we visited here, the Kirgiz compatriots had just passed through the tense harvest season.
    The Second Township People's Government conducted a census after the harvest. The livestock (especially sheep) of the whole township increased by more than 100% in most cases, and by more than 25% in the least. Township Chief Almanbaiti led us to visit the herder Bubi. Bubi is a widow with a family of five: the eldest son, Xia'erxiangbo, is a soldier of the People's Liberation Army; the second son, Sapa'erbo, and Kulehali, were recently married and are in charge of herding and managing housework at home; the third son, Kalabo, is now a second-grade student. Bubi had only 70 or 80 livestock in 1951; in 1952, the number of large and small livestock (including horses, cattle, and sheep) increased to more than 100; this year alone, 92 ewes gave birth to 101 lambs (including twins); 10 horses gave birth to 4 foals, and 7 dairy cows gave birth to 3 calves. Bubi pays great attention to frugality. Eating lamb in the summer is originally a Kirgiz custom, but Bubi has rarely done so in the past two years. She cherishes the newborn livestock very much. Bubi, her second son Sapa'erbo, and her daughter-in-law take turns watching over them at night. Therefore, none of her small livestock has died. When we congratulated her on this year's harvest, she pointed to her second daughter-in-law, who was milking a mare, and said with a smile, "You forgot to congratulate us on another happy event, Sapa'erbo and Kulehali got married this spring!" The township chief also said with a smile, "We also want to wish you a grandson next year!" Kulehali also laughed with everyone. When we said goodbye to Bubi, the township chief added, "Don't forget to write a letter to Xia'erxiangbo about the happy event at home, so that he can be happy too." Bubi said, "You are saying that too late, I asked Kalabo to write a letter a few days ago."
    The Kirgiz compatriots all thank the People's Government for this year's harvest. They believe that this year's harvest is inseparable from the People's Government's help to the Kirgiz compatriots. Every spring and autumn, the Tekes County People's Government sends veterinarians here to give livestock universal vaccinations and treat sick livestock. According to last year's statistics, veterinarians treated more than 3,000 sick livestock for the Kirgiz compatriots in Kukseke Pasture. In the past two years, thanks to the help of the People's Government, there have been no serious infectious diseases among the livestock here. This spring, the Livestock Bureau of the County People's Government gathered experienced herders for training, helped them to summarize their grazing experience, taught them advanced grazing methods, as well as methods for collecting winter grass and treating snake bites, and then promoted the advanced experience to the majority of herders through them. This has created good conditions for the development of local animal husbandry.
    Due to the bumper harvest, the lives of the Kirgiz compatriots are gradually improving. The number of new tents on the pasture is increasing year by year. According to statistics from the Third Township, more than 20 households made new tents last year, and more than 30 households added new tents this year; dozens of households are making felt with new wool and are preparing to purchase new tents after autumn. Every family has sufficient living materials, such as flour, cloth, tea, salt, and sugar. This was not the case in the past. During the rule of the Kuomintang bandits, because the trade in pastoral areas was not developed, it was difficult for herders to obtain daily necessities. It often took more than ten years to wear a set of clothes, and they could not eat flour, salt, and tea all year round. Herder Abuduhadier said: "Now, people's living standards have improved. My daughter, Laziman, made two floral cloth skirts in the spring, and now she wants to buy silk skirts. The children put some sugar in their tea, which was unimaginable in the past."
    The trade group sent by the People's Government played a great role in improving the economic life of the Kirgiz compatriots. The staff of the group transported materials to the pastoral areas despite the hardships to supply the needs of the herders, and purchased pastoral products at reasonable prices stipulated by the People's Government. Kirgiz elder Ashan Nahong said: "In the past, because no one came here to purchase, many products could not be sold, and the materials needed by the herders could not be supplied in time. In the past, a four-year-old cow could only be exchanged for cloth for a set of clothes, and two sheep could be exchanged for a brick of tea. With the trade group, we no longer feel short of daily necessities. Now, a four-year-old cow can be sold for more than 760,000 yuan, which is equal to the price of two bolts of printed cloth; a sheep can be sold for more than 150,000 yuan, which is approximately equal to more than 100 jin of flour."
    When we visited the Kirgiz elder Namazi Bek, he was teasing his one-year-old grandson. He is a person who suffered a lot in the old society. But the old man was unwilling to talk about his past. He said: "I don't want to talk about my past, because that will make me cry, and it will also torment your hearts. Let's talk about the exciting new life!" Namazi Bek told me about his living conditions. His family has a total of seven people, and the livestock has doubled in the past two years. The furnishings in the tent are all new: new carpets, new bedding, new saddles...etc. A new tent is being planned; it is also planned to buy two stallions in the autumn and harvest more than 10,000 jin of winter grass.
    In the morning and evening, children and women ride horses on the pasture, they are all students of pastoral primary schools and women's literacy classes. The County People's Government organized pastoral primary schools for the Kirgiz compatriots the year before last. Last year, women's literacy classes were organized for Kirgiz women. According to statistics, more than 90% of Kirgiz school-age children have entered schools, and their academic performance is very good. Although the women's literacy class was established last year, many people can now write letters and read newspapers. For example, after a year of study, Anarjiang can write simple letters. The schools and literacy classes here use both Kirgiz and Kazakh languages, but due to printing conditions, textbooks in Kirgiz language have not yet been published. Therefore, teachers must temporarily copy teaching materials.
    At dusk, when the pasture is illuminated by the golden sun, a wisp of blue smoke rises from the top of every white tent; bold and joyful songs are heard from the tents. (Attached picture)

    在库克塞克牧场上
    本报记者  朱波
    库克塞克牧场是特克斯县三区第一、二、三乡牧民的夏季牧场，风景非常优美。站在阿登陶山的高峰，可看到牧场的全景：那峻峭的山石，那深远的山谷和幽静的杉林和明镜似的河水；绿色地毯似的场地，衬托着白色的帐房和缓缓滚动着的牧群。远处，在蔚蓝色的背景前，矗立着常年不化的雪山。就在这图画般的地方，我们的兄弟民族柯尔克孜族的同胞正建设着自己的新生活。
    牧场上的牧民，大部分是属于柯尔克孜族的，共有九百余户，五千多人。其中有些是在解放后从国境线上的深山里迁移来的。我们到这里访问的时候，柯族同胞刚刚度过了紧张的丰收季节。
    二乡人民政府在丰收后曾作过一次统计，全乡的牲畜（尤其是羊），最多的增加百分之百以上，最少的也增加了百分之二十五以上。乡长阿尔曼拜提引我们访问了牧民布比。布比是一个寡妇，她全家共五口人：大儿夏尔向伯，是人民解放军的战士；二儿撒帕尔伯和库勒哈丽，最近才结婚，在家放牧和管理家务；三儿卡拉伯现在是二年级的学生。布比在一九五一年只有七、八十只牲畜；一九五二年，大小牲畜（包括马、牛、羊）增加到一百多只；今年仅九十二只母羊生了一百零一只羊羔（内有双羔）；十匹马生了四匹马驹，七头乳牛生了三头小牛。布比很注意节约，每年夏天吃羊羔肉，本来是柯尔克孜族的习惯，但是布比在最近两年来很少这样作。她对新生的小牲畜是非常爱护的。布比和二儿撒帕尔伯、儿媳在夜间轮流看护它们。因此，她的小牲畜没有发生死亡的现象。当我们恭贺她今年的丰收时，她指了指正在挤马奶的二儿媳，笑着说：“你们忘记了祝贺我们的另一件喜事，撒帕尔伯和库勒哈丽已在今年春天结了婚！”乡长也笑着说：“我们还要祝你明年抱一个小孙孙！”说得库勒哈丽也随着大家笑了。我们告别布比时，乡长还说：“你不要忘记把家里的喜事写信告诉夏尔向伯，也要他高兴高兴。”布比说：“你的话说晚了，前几天我已经叫卡拉伯写信去啦。”
    柯尔克孜族同胞，都为今年的丰收感谢人民政府。他们认为今年的丰收是和人民政府对柯族同胞的帮助分不开的。每年春秋两季，特克斯县人民政府都派兽医来这里，普遍地给牲畜进行预防注射，并治疗有病的牲畜。据去年的统计，兽医在库克塞克牧场为柯族同胞治好了三千多只有病的牲畜。两年来，由于人民政府的帮助，这里的牲畜没有发生严重的传染病。今年春季，县人民政府牧畜科又集中了有经验的牧民进行训练，帮助他们总结放牧经验，授以先进的放牧方法，以及收藏冬草、医治毒蛇咬伤等办法，然后通过他们来向广大牧民推广先进经验。这为发展当地的牧畜业创造了良好的条件。
    由于丰收，柯族同胞的生活逐步改善着。牧场上新帐房一年比一年地增多。据三乡统计，去年有二十多户做了新帐房，今年添制新帐房的则有三十多户；有几十户正用新羊毛制着毡子，并准备在秋后购置新帐房。家家都有足够的生活资料，如面粉、布匹、茶、食盐和糖等。这种情况过去是没有的。在国民党匪帮统治时期，因牧区贸易得不到发展，牧民很难得到日常生活资料，做了一套衣服往往要穿十多年，也长年吃不到面粉、食盐和茶叶。牧民阿布都哈迪尔说：“现在，人们的生活水平有了提高，我的女儿拉齐曼在春天做了两套花布裙子，现在又要买丝料的裙子。孩子们喝茶时在茶里给放些糖，这在过去是想不到的事情。”
    在改善柯族同胞的经济生活上，人民政府派出的贸易小组起了很大的作用。小组的工作人员不避艰苦地把物资运往牧区，供应牧民的需要，并根据人民政府规定的合理价格收购牧区的产品。柯族老人阿山那洪说：“过去，因没有人来这里收购，许多产品卖不出去，而牧民所需要的物资又得不到及时的供应。过去一头四岁的牛只能换一套衣服的布料，两只羊换一块砖茶。有了贸易小组，我们的日用品再也不感到缺少了。现在，一头四岁的牛可以卖七十六万多元，等于两匹花布的价钱；一只羊卖十五万多元，约折合一百多斤面粉。”
    我们访问柯族老人那麻孜别克时，他正逗着他的一周岁多的孙子玩耍。他是一个在旧社会里饱受过折磨的人。可是老人却不愿意谈他的过去。他说：“我不想谈我的过去，因为那样会使我流眼泪，也会折磨你们的心，还是谈一谈使人兴奋的新生活吧！”那麻孜别克对我叙述了自己的生活情况。他全家共有七口人，两年来牲畜增加了一倍。帐房里的摆设全是新的：新地毯、新被褥、新马鞍…等。新帐房正在计划添置中；还计划在秋季买两匹种马，收割一万多斤冬草。
    早晨和傍晚，儿童和妇女骑着骏马在牧场上奔驰，他们都是牧区小学和妇女识字班的学生。前年，县人民政府为柯族同胞组织了牧区小学。去年又为柯族妇女组织了妇女识字班。据统计，柯族的学龄儿童百分之九十以上进了学校，而且学习成绩都很好。妇女识字班虽然是在去年成立的，但很多人现在已经会写信和阅读报纸，例如，阿娜尔江经过一年的学习，已经能写简单的书信了。这里的学校和识字班，都用柯尔克孜文和哈萨克文，但因印刷条件的限制，柯族语文的课本还没有出版，因此，教员必须临时抄写教材。
    黄昏，当牧场被金黄色的太阳照耀着的时候，每一个白色的帐房顶上都冉冉升起一缕蓝色的炊烟；从帐房里传出了豪放而愉快的歌声。(附图片)
