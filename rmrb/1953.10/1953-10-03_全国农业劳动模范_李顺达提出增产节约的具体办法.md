    National Model Agricultural Laborer
    Li Shunda Proposes Specific Methods for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy

Respected Chairman Mao:

    The fourth National Day is coming, and I feel boundless joy and excitement. Under your wise leadership, the motherland has begun its first Five-Year Plan. We on the agricultural production front must increase grain and industrial raw materials to support economic construction and meet the needs of the people nationwide. We have suffered from drought this year. To overcome the difficulties caused by natural disasters and to complete our agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative's increased production plan victoriously and beyond expectations, I will lead the cooperative members to actively increase production and practice economy, ensuring that the following tasks are completed before autumn:

    1.  Do a good job in the autumn harvest to ensure that however much the crops ripen is how much we harvest. In addition to strictly preventing chickens, birds, and mountain pests from spoiling the crops, the most important thing is to change the harvesting methods. In the past, millet was cut down and moved back several days later, and most of it was transported by livestock. When harvesting corn, the focus was only on speed, and many ears were dropped. This year, we will cut and transport as it ripens, using manpower to transport it, ensuring that no ears of corn are dropped (with someone specially assigned to inspect and record points). We have calculated that the cooperative's 261 mu of millet and corn can reduce losses by 1,022 jin compared to last year. In addition, we must change the past habit of "harvesting or not, eating through the autumn" and achieve careful calculation and sustainable use.

    2.  The cooperative's wheat fields have been expanded by 17 percent compared to the past, and all have been sown by the White Dew solar term. Each mu of land is fertilized with 60 dan (5 dan more than last year); the seeding rate per mu has been increased to 10 to 16 jin (last year it was 8 to 12 jin), achieving appropriate close planting. We strive to increase wheat production to 153 jin per mu next year.

    3.  Achieve early plowing, deep plowing, and universal plowing, plowing 20 percent of the land twice; combine harvesting and plowing, plowing immediately after harvesting, completing plowing before the ground freezes.

    4.  Seize the favorable conditions before autumn to compress all weeds and stalks into fertilizer, and also diligently pad the pens. Accumulate 5,000 dan of fertilizer before autumn; and accumulate 2,000 jin of wild grass to prepare the sheep herd for winter.

    Increasing production and practicing economy is a long-term task. On the basis of completing the pre-autumn production increase and economy plan, all cooperative members will also carry out pre-winter production increase and economy work, vigorously accumulate fertilizer, and carry out agricultural capital construction and sideline production. All cooperative members will also sell all surplus grain to the state. We will use the above practical actions to celebrate this year's National Day.

    全国农业劳动模范
    李顺达提出增产节约的具体办法敬爱的毛主席：
    第四届国庆节来到了，我心里有说不尽的愉快和兴奋。祖国在您的英明领导下，开始了第一个五年计划。我们在农业生产战线上一定要增产粮食和工业原料，以支援经济建设和供应全国人民的需要。我们今年遭受了旱灾。为了战胜天灾造成的困难，胜利地、超额地完成我们农林畜牧生产合作社的增产计划，我要领导社员积极增产节约，保证在秋前做好以下几件工作：
    一、做好秋收工作，保证几成庄稼几成收。除了严防鸡鸟和山害糟蹋庄稼外，最重要的是改变收打办法。往年是割倒谷子几天后才往回搬运，而且大部是牲口运；收割玉茭也是光图快，掉穗很多。今年要随黄随割、随用人力运，割玉茭做到不掉一穗（有专人检查记分）。我们计算了一下，全社谷子和玉茭二百六十一亩可以比去年减少损失一千零二十二斤。此外，我们要改变过去“收不收、吃一秋”的习惯，做到精打细算、细水长流。
    二、我社的麦田比过去扩大了百分之十七，在白露节已全部下了种。每亩地上肥六十担（比去年增加五担）；播种量每亩增加到十斤到十六斤（去年是八斤到十二斤），做到适当的密植。争取明年小麦每亩增产到一百五十三斤。
    三、做到早耕、深耕、普耕，百分之二十的地耕两遍；要收耕结合，随收随耕，在地封前耕完。
    四、抓住秋前的有利条件，把所有杂草、秸秆等都压成肥料，还要勤垫圈。秋前要积肥五千担；并积野草二千斤，准备羊群过冬。
    增产节约是个长期的任务。我们全体社员在完成秋前增产节约计划的基础上，还要开展冬前增产节约工作，大力积肥，并进行农业基本建设和副业生产。全体社员还要把所有余粮售给国家。我们要用以上实际行动来庆祝今年的国庆节。
