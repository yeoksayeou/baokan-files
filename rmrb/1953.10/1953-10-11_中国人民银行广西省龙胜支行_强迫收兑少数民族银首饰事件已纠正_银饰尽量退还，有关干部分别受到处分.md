The Longsheng Branch of the People's Bank of China in Guangxi Province (hereinafter referred to as Longsheng Branch) violated ethnic policies by forcibly collecting silver ornaments from local ethnic minorities, causing serious adverse consequences. After the Guangxi Provincial People's Supervisory Committee and other units sent special personnel to investigate, the incident has been seriously dealt with: in accordance with the opinions of the masses, silver ornaments were returned, losses to the masses were compensated, and those responsible were given disciplinary actions according to the severity of their responsibilities.

In August 1952, the Guilin Central Branch of the People's Bank of China held a meeting of branch managers from various counties in the Guilin Special Zone. At the meeting, savings targets were assigned, with Longsheng Branch allocated 460 million yuan. After the then Deputy Director of Longsheng Branch, Feng Anzhong, and others returned to the county, they convened a meeting of business office directors. In order to show off to their superiors, they disregarded the county's economic conditions and the savings capacity of the masses, unilaterally expanded the figure allocated by the Central Branch, and set a savings target of 1.1 billion yuan. Furthermore, they did not convey the spirit of "complete as much as you can" as instructed by the Guilin Central Branch and the County Party Committee, nor did they explain the policies and methods. The directors of the business offices felt that the task was too heavy and lacked confidence in completing it. Longsheng County is an area where Dong, Zhuang, Yao, Miao, Han, and other ethnic groups reside together. Ethnic minorities, especially women, have the custom of wearing silver ornaments. Therefore, the head of the accounting section of Longsheng Branch, Zhou Yunfeng, said to the directors of the business offices after the meeting: "The ethnic minorities in Longsheng have many silver ornaments, we can mobilize them to save." He also gave a deceptive method to mislead the masses: "These silver ornaments are mostly only 30% pure, when we promote, we only say 8,000 yuan per tael (without saying that the silver is only 30% pure). Internally, we will calculate based on 30% and issue savings deposit slips." The directors of the business offices accepted the huge savings target, but were unclear about the principles and methods of mobilizing the masses to save, and were struggling to find a way. As a result, most of them thought Zhou Yunfeng's method was very good.

The Sishui and Guanya business offices did not deceive the masses according to Zhou Yunfeng's method when collecting silver ornaments. They truthfully explained to the masses that the silver would be calculated according to its purity in the future, and would mostly only be 30% pure, so they did not collect much. In Daluo Township within the jurisdiction of the Piaoli business office, the forced collection of silver ornaments by bank cadres aroused dissatisfaction among the ethnic minority masses. After the director of the County Public Security Bureau personally went to handle the matter, the silver ornaments were returned to their owners, and the error was corrected immediately. The most serious situation occurred at the Pingdeng business office. After the director of the Pingdeng business office, Long Zeyuan, returned from a meeting in the county, he contacted the district people's government, jointly notified the townships, convened an enlarged meeting of township cadres, and assigned savings tasks. Long Zeyuan said at the meeting: "Not using silver ornaments for savings means not being patriotic." "Silver ornaments are dead treasures, exchanging them turns dead treasures into living treasures." The meeting also "cultivated" activists, launched challenges, "self-reported" tasks, and called on township cadres to take the lead. Long Zeyuan also asked cadres to mobilize the masses to "assess" each other, and even instructed primary school teachers to mobilize primary school students to go home and persuade their mothers to exchange silver ornaments. He also used Zhou Yunfeng's method to vaguely promote "silver at 8,000 yuan per tael," deceiving the masses.

Long Zeyuan's commandist style made grassroots cadres unscrupulous in mobilizing savings. One township cadre forced the masses to exchange silver ornaments, even pulling ornaments from women's heads. Some said: "Wearing silver ornaments in the future is a feudal and backward manifestation!" Under this threat and intimidation, the masses were very frightened and forced to take out their silver ornaments. From September 3rd to 19th, in just over ten days, the business office exchanged and stored a total of 20,537 taels of silver ornaments. After receiving the silver ornaments, the business office issued three-month, six-month, and one-year deposit slips based on 8,000 yuan per tael, with each tael calculated at 30%. The masses saw that each tael only yielded more than 2,000 yuan, and that it was not cash, and their opinions were varied. At the same time, because the bank's accounts were chaotic, some people handed in silver but it disappeared, and the masses' opinions were even greater. However, at this time, most of the silver ornaments had been transported to Guilin, and the names of the owners attached to the silver ornaments had been removed. Some had been cut and trimmed due to testing for purity.

The Longsheng Branch's forced collection of silver ornaments was seriously detached from the masses and caused serious adverse consequences. First, the masses did not understand that this incident was a violation of law and discipline by individual cadres, and thus became suspicious of the policies of the Party and the People's Government. Secondly, the enthusiasm of the masses for production was also hit. During this year's spring plowing production, production meetings could not be held in areas of Longsheng County where silver ornaments had been exchanged. A Dong woman was too lazy to weave cloth, fearing that the government would want to save it. The forced exchange of silver ornaments also created rifts between ethnic groups and disunity within ethnic groups. Ethnic minority masses believed that this incident was caused by the Han people, and thus harbored resentment towards the Han people. Dong cadre Meng Guang went to Guangnan Township to distribute money for the exchanged silver, and the masses said: "You are a Dong, if you were a Han, you would be impolite!"

The reason why this incident could occur was due to the Longsheng Branch's serious bureaucratic leadership and complete lack of attention to ethnic policies, as well as the commandism and lack of organization and discipline of the cadres below caused by this. The reason why this incident could develop to such a serious degree was also inseparable from the bureaucratic attitude of the Party and government leadership in Longsheng County and their lack of attention to ethnic policies.

After the incident occurred, the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee and the Guangxi Provincial People's Government attached great importance to it and immediately ordered the Provincial People's Supervisory Committee, the Provincial Ethnic Affairs Commission, and the Guangxi Branch of the People's Bank of China to send special personnel to form an inspection team, led by Huang Chuanlin, Director Secretary of the Provincial People's Supervisory Committee, to go to Longsheng County to investigate and deal with the matter. The inspection team arrived in Longsheng on March 24 this year. In order to widely solicit opinions from the masses and correctly resolve this issue, the inspection team, together with cadres from the Longsheng County Autonomous Region People's Government, went to various townships in groups to understand the situation. Then, on March 31, they convened a meeting of representatives of silver ornament exchange and storage households. At the meeting, Huang Chuanlin, the leader of the inspection team, first gave a report, pointing out that the bank's collection of silver ornaments, which damaged the customs and habits of fraternal ethnic groups, violated Chairman Mao's ethnic policies and committed a serious error. He also explained that this was the error of individual cadres and was not tolerated by the Communist Party and the People's Government, and asked everyone to offer more opinions and find a correct way to solve this problem. In order to make everyone believe that the purity of the exchanged silver ornaments was indeed very low, an exhibition of exchanged silver ornaments was held, and silver ornaments with 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% purity were displayed separately, and tested on the spot for the representatives to see. Finally, Huang Chuanlin summarized according to everyone's opinions and proposed a solution to this problem: 1. A "Clearing Exchange Work Committee" should be formed, consisting of the county magistrate, deputy county magistrate, director of the Longsheng Branch, and district chiefs of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Districts, to be responsible for handling the silver ornament exchange work; 2. Silver ornaments in the bank's business offices with names on them should be returned in full; 3. Those sent to Guilin, where the names have been mixed up and cannot be returned to the original owners, should allow the exchange and storage households to report the quantity and type they need to be returned (not exceeding the quantity they exchanged) in order to meet the requirements of the exchange and storage households; the bank should return them according to the needs of each household; 4. Those who do not want silver ornaments or only want part of them returned should be calculated at 6,000 yuan per tael, regardless of purity. The representatives unanimously expressed satisfaction with these solutions and passed this summary as a resolution of the meeting.

Through this meeting, the representatives realized that the forced exchange of silver ornaments was not intentionally done by the Communist Party and the People's Government, nor was it that the Han elder brothers intentionally bullied fraternal ethnic groups, but that individual cadres violated the policy. As a result, prejudices against the Party and the People's Government were eliminated. Yang Ruxiang, a representative from Baotian Township, said: "After listening to the report, seeing the exhibition and the testing, I understand. I exchanged a lot of silver, and I had the biggest opinions in the past. Now I advocate calculating at 4,000 yuan per tael, because our silver is all below 50% purity. Now the government calculates at 6,000 yuan per tael, which is equivalent to 75% purity. The government is losing too much." Rong Guanying, a representative from Xiaoba Village in Baotian Township, pointed to Chairman Mao's portrait after the meeting and said to the inspection team cadres: "It won't be wrong to follow Chairman Mao's policies. Seeing you is like seeing Chairman Mao, thank you." The representatives expressed full confidence in returning to convey the resolutions of the meeting to the masses and clearing up the masses' thoughts. For example, Shi Wanzhi, a Dong representative from Baozeng Township, said: "My mother makes trouble at home every day. After this meeting, I am fully confident that I can persuade my mother. Starting with my family, I guarantee that all the people in the village will be satisfied."

The specific follow-up work was handled by Deputy County Magistrate Yang Ruiqing and was completed before April 15.

Based on the actual situation of this incident, the inspection team, after consulting with the prefectural party committee and the administrative office, gave appropriate punishment to Zhou Nianzhao, the current Deputy Director of the Longsheng Branch, and others. Although the Longsheng County Party Committee had paid attention to this incident at one time and gave correct instructions to the Longsheng Branch, it one-sidedly believed the untruthful reports of the branch and did not delve into the situation. It did not pay attention until the masses were generally dissatisfied and did not actively solve the problem. It has made a profound self-criticism.

    中国人民银行广西省龙胜支行
    强迫收兑少数民族银首饰事件已纠正
    银饰尽量退还，有关干部分别受到处分
    中国人民银行广西省龙胜县支行（以下简称龙胜支行）违反民族政策，强迫收兑当地少数民族的银首饰，造成严重恶果；这一事件经广西省人民监察委员会等单位派专人进行调查后，已作了严肃处理：根据群众意见，退还银饰，赔偿群众损失，对失职人员，按责任大小，分别给予处分。
    一九五二年八月，人民银行桂林中心支行召开桂林专区各县支行行长会议，会上分配储蓄任务，龙胜支行分配数字为四亿六千万元。龙胜支行前任副行长俸安中等回县后，召开了营业所主任会议。他们为了向上级表现自己，不顾本县经济条件和群众的储蓄能力，擅自扩大中心支行分配的数字，布置了十一亿元的储蓄任务，且没有把桂林中心支行和县委指示的“完成多少算多少”的精神传达下去，也没有交代政策和作法。各营业所主任感到任务太重，没有信心完成任务。龙胜县为侗、僮、瑶、苗、汉等民族杂居区，少数民族特别是妇女，有戴银饰的习惯，因此，龙胜支行会计股股长周云峰在会后便向各营业所主任说：“龙胜少数民族有很多银首饰，可以发动他们储蓄。”并附带告诉一种欺骗群众的方法：“这些银子大都只有三成，我们宣传时，只说八千元一两（不说出银子只有三成），我们内部则按三成计算掌握，给予储蓄存单。”各营业所主任接受了庞大的储蓄任务，但对于发动群众储蓄的方针、方法又不清楚，正苦于没有办法，于是大部分人认为周云峰的办法很好。
    泗水、官衙两营业所在收兑银饰中，没有按照周云峰的办法欺骗群众，据实向群众说明银子将来按成色计算，大都只有三成，所以收兑不多。瓢里营业所范围内的大罗乡，因银行干部强迫收兑银饰，引起少数民族群众不满，经县公安局局长亲往处理，将银饰退还原主，即时纠正了错误。情况最严重的是平等营业所。平等营业所主任龙泽源在县开会回去后，就和区人民政府取得联系，联合通知各乡，召开乡干部扩大会议，布置储蓄任务。龙泽源在会上说：“不拿银首饰储蓄就是不爱国。”“银首饰是死宝，兑换了就把死宝变成了活宝。”会上并“培养”了积极分子，发动挑战，“自报”任务，又号召乡干部带头。龙泽源还要干部发动群众互相“摸底”，甚至布置小学教员发动小学生回家动员母亲兑换银饰。并用周云峰的办法，含混地宣传“银子八千元一两”，欺骗群众。
    龙泽源的强迫命令作风，使基层干部在发动储蓄中，也不择手段。一个乡干部强迫群众出兑银饰，自己在妇女头上拔下首饰。有的说：“以后戴银首饰是封建落后的表现！”在这种威胁恐吓之下，群众非常恐惧，被迫拿出银饰。从九月三日到十九日的十几天中，该营业所共兑储银饰二万零五百三十七两。该营业所在收到银首饰后，按八千元一两、每两按三成计算，开出三月、半年、一年的存单。群众见每两只得两千多元，且不是现款，意见纷纷；同时，因为银行账目混乱，有些人交了银子，没有下落，群众意见更大。但这时银饰已大部运往桂林，附在银饰上的物主姓名都已拆掉，有些因验成色，且已切削。
    龙胜支行这一强迫收兑银饰事件，严重地脱离了群众，造成了严重不良后果。首先，群众不了解这件事是个别干部的违法乱纪，因而对于党和人民政府的政策发生怀疑。其次群众的生产积极性也受到打击。今年春耕生产时，龙胜县兑换过银首饰的地区，生产会议都开不起来。一个侗族妇女连布也懒得织，怕织了布政府又要储蓄。强迫兑换银饰事件，也造成了民族间的隔阂和民族内部的不团结。少数民族群众认为这一事件是汉族捣鬼，因而迁怒到汉族人民身上。侗族干部蒙光到广南乡去发兑银子的钱，群众说：“你是侗族，如果是汉族，就会不客气！”
    这一事件所以能发生，是由于龙胜支行的严重的官僚主义领导和丝毫不注意民族政策，以及因此造成的下面干部的命令主义和无组织无纪律。这一事件所以能发展到如此严重的地步也是与龙胜县党、政领导上的官僚主义和不注意民族政策的态度分不开的。
    事件发生后，中共广西省委、广西省人民政府都十分重视，立即责成省人民监察委员会、省民族事务委员会和中国人民银行广西省分行派专人组成检查组，由省人民监察委员会主任秘书黄传林率领前往龙胜县调查处理。检查组在今年三月二十四日到达龙胜。为了广泛征求群众意见，正确解决这一问题，检查组工作人员会同龙胜县自治区人民政府干部，分组到各乡了解情况后，于三月三十一日召开了银饰兑储户代表会议。会上先由检查组组长黄传林作了报告，指出银行收兑银饰，破坏兄弟民族风俗习惯，是违反了毛主席的民族政策，犯了严重错误；同时说明这是个别干部的错误，是共产党、人民政府所不容许的，并要求大家多提意见，找出解决这一问题的正确办法。为了使大家确信收兑的银饰成色确实很低，曾举办了兑出的银饰展览会，将一成、二成、三成、四成的银饰分类展出，并当场化验给代表们看。最后，黄传林根据大家的意见作了总结，提出解决这一问题的办法：一、由县长、副县长、龙胜支行行长及四、五、六区区长等九人组成“清理兑换工作委员会”，负责处理银饰兑换工作；二、现在银行营业所的银饰，上面有名有姓的，一律退还；三、已送桂林的，上面姓名已乱，不可能退还原主，为了满足储兑户的要求，储兑户可自报需要退回的数量和种类（不超过自己兑出的数量），银行根据各户需要退还；四、不愿要银饰或只要部分退还的，不分成色，按六千元一两计算。代表们一致满意这些解决办法，并通过这个总结为大会决议。
    通过这次会议，代表们认识到强兑银饰事件不是共产党和人民政府故意要这样作，也不是汉族老大哥有意欺侮兄弟民族，而是个别干部违反了政策，因而消除了对党和人民政府的偏见。苞田乡代表杨如香说：“听了报告，看了展览和化验，我明白了。我换出的银子很多，过去意见也最大。现在我主张按四千元一两计算，因为我们的银子都在五成以下，现在政府照六千元一两计算，已算到七成五，政府吃亏太大了。”苞田乡小坝屯的代表荣惯英在会后指着毛主席的像向检查组干部说：“根据毛主席的政策办事就不会错。看见你们就像看见毛主席一样，谢谢你们。”代表们对回去向群众传达大会决议、打通群众思想，表示有充分信心。如宝赠乡侗族代表石万芝说：“我母亲天天在家闹，经过这次会议，我完全有信心说服我母亲。由我家带头，保证全村群众都会满意。”
    具体的善后工作，由副县长杨瑞清负责，在四月十五日以前已处理完毕。
    根据这一事件实际情况，检查组在商得地委、专署同意后，予龙胜支行现任副行长周念钊等以适当的处分。中共龙胜县委虽曾一度注意这一事件，对龙胜支行作了正确指示，但因片面相信支行的不真实报告，不深入了解情况，直到群众普遍不满时才予以注意，没有主动解决这一问题，已作了深刻检讨。
