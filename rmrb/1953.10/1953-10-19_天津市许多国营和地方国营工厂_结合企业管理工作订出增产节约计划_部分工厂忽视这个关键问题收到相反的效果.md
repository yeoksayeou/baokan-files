    Many State-Owned and Locally State-Owned Factories in Tianjin
    Combine Enterprise Management Work to Formulate Production Increase and Thrift Plans
    Some Factories Neglect This Key Issue and Receive the Opposite Effect
    The correctness of the idea that launching a production increase and thrift campaign in factories and enterprises must be combined with improving enterprise management has been proven in the work of widely mobilizing workshops and teams in Tianjin's state-owned and locally state-owned factories to discuss and formulate production increase and thrift plans.
    Tianjin's state-owned and locally state-owned factories have concluded the work of mobilizing the masses to discuss and formulate specific targets for production increase and thrift. According to preliminary calculations, the total value of the production increase and thrift plan, after discussion by the masses, has increased by more than 15% compared to the original targets set by the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. In this process, the factories adopted two different approaches, which resulted in obviously different effects. The first type of factory clearly grasped the guiding ideology of starting with improving production management, seized the key to production, and achieved the goal of increasing production and thrift; they put forward specific directions and requirements to the workshops and teams, guiding the masses to study and solve key problems; as a result, a large number of tricks and rationalization proposals emerged during the discussion and formulation of production increase and thrift plans, and appropriate technical measures were formulated to ensure them. For example, the State-Owned Tianjin No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, starting from the requirement of strengthening technical management, mobilized the masses to formulate guarantee methods to improve efficiency, mobilized technical personnel to go deep into the workshops to help workers calculate detailed accounts, and proposed effective technical measures; the efficiency of looms has increased from 94.35% to 94.5%. Tricks and creations emerged endlessly: Engineer Wang Jiaxiang created a waste cotton processing machine, which can save 200 million yuan worth of raw cotton throughout the year. After six repeated discussions and calculations, Wang Yusen's team increased the team's production plan from 20 cotton yarns to 21.73 yarns. After proposing a plan to increase the production of 12,000 bicycles, the Tianjin Bicycle Factory immediately mobilized all employees to find tricks, tap potential, overcome weak links, and combine this with improving work plans and establishing a responsibility system to ensure the completion of the production increase plan. In just over half a month, all employees of the factory put forward more than 100 rationalization proposals for increasing production and thrift, many of which have a significant impact on improving work plans and increasing production equilibrium rates. The handlebar team suggested improving labor organization and implementing segmented assembly line operations, reducing the amount of handlebars used by nearly half; Yan Chunhong, a labor model in the punching die team, created an automatic multi-head punching die, which combined two processes into one, increasing output by two times, and the production equilibrium rate increased from 30% in the past to 96%. About 30 factories belong to this type, still accounting for a minority of the factories in the city.
    The second type of factory, the leadership did not well grasp the guiding ideology that it must be combined with improving enterprise management, and therefore they focused on deducting numbers, or focused on encouraging the enthusiasm of employees without pointing out the key and direction of production increase and thrift to the masses; although the masses were enthusiastic, they could only discuss in general terms when formulating production increase and thrift plans, and not many tricks or creations emerged. Some individual factories have disrupted the original deployment of management work, or adopted overtime and rush work, and some have even caused accidents. For example, after inspecting the implementation of the plan in the first half of the year, the Local State-Owned Woolen Mill had already found the key problems of the entire factory, but as soon as the production increase and thrift campaign was launched, the original deployment was disrupted, and the leadership felt that there were problems everywhere, and they only shouted slogans when mobilizing the masses without proposing specific measures to ensure it. In the past, the printing machines of the Local State-Owned Printing and Dyeing Factory No. 1 produced 1,700 pieces per day in two shifts. After the competition started, the two shifts blindly competed. Shift A wrote on the blackboard newspaper: "Strive for 1,350 pieces," and Shift B wrote: "Strive for 1,404 pieces," and adopted the rush method of adding two hours of night shift without stopping the machines. It was later discovered and corrected by the leadership. When mobilizing the workers, the Local State-Owned Printing and Dyeing Factory No. 2 said: "Don't consider objective conditions, produce as much as you can," so the workers blindly increased production. The next day, the steam supply was insufficient, and the tap water was also insufficient.
    At a meeting to review the work of this stage, the Industrial Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China emphasized to the leaders of each factory to correct the guiding ideology and implement the policy that launching a production increase and thrift campaign in factories and enterprises must be combined with improving production management.

    天津市许多国营和地方国营工厂
    结合企业管理工作订出增产节约计划
    部分工厂忽视这个关键问题收到相反的效果
    在工厂企业中开展增产节约竞赛必须和改善企业管理工作相结合，这一思想的正确性已在天津市国营和地方国营工厂普遍发动车间、小组讨论制订增产节约计划的工作中得到证明。
    天津市国营和地方国营工厂已结束了发动群众讨论制订增产节约具体奋斗目标的工作。据初步计算，增产节约总值计划经群众讨论后已较中共天津市委原定的指标提高了百分之十五以上。在这个过程中，各厂有两种不同的做法，收到了显然两样的效果。第一类工厂，领导思想明确地掌握了从改进生产管理着手，抓住了生产上的关键，达到增产节约的目的；对车间和小组提出具体的方向和要求，引导群众研究解决关键问题；因而在讨论制订增产节约计划中出现了大量窍门和合理化建议，并订出了恰当的技术措施保证。例如：国营天津第六棉纺织厂从加强技术管理的要求出发，发动群众订保证办法提高效率，发动技术人员深入车间帮助工人算细账并提出有效的技术措施，布机效率已由百分之九十四点三五提高到百分之九十四点五。窍门和创造源源出现：王家祥工程师创造了处理废棉机，全年可节约价值二亿元的原棉。王玉森小组经过六次反复讨论核算，把小组增产计划从二十件棉纱提高到二十一点七三件。天津自行车厂提出了增产一万二千辆自行车的计划后，即动员全厂职工找窍门，挖潜力，克服薄弱环节，并结合健全作业计划，建立责任制以保证增产计划的完成。半个多月，全厂职工便提出了一百多项增产节约的合理化建议，其中许多对健全作业计划提高生产均衡率都有重大作用。车把班建议改善劳动组织，实行分段流水作业，使车把占用量减少将近一半；冲模班劳动模范阎春洪创造了自动多头冲模，把两道工序合并为一道工序，产量提高了两倍，生产均衡率由过去的百分之三十提高到了百分之九十六。属于这类的工厂约有三十余个，在全市工厂中仍占少数。
    第二类工厂，领导方面没有很好掌握必须与改善企业管理相结合这一指导思想，因而就偏重于扣数字，或偏重于鼓动职工热情而没有向群众指出增产节约的关键和方向；群众虽然热情高涨但制订增产节约计划时，只能泛泛地讨论，没有出现很多的窍门或创造。其中个别的工厂已经打乱了原来管理工作的部署，或采取加班加点突击，有的甚至造成了事故。例如，地方国营毛织厂经过检查上半年计划执行情况以后，原已找出了全厂的关键问题，但一开展增产节约竞赛，原来部署乱了，领导方面感觉到处都是问题，在动员群众时只是空喊，不提出具体措施保证。地方国营印染一厂印花机过去两班日产一千七百匹，开展竞赛后，两班盲目竞赛，甲班在黑板报上写：“为一千三百五十匹而奋斗”，乙班就写：“为一千四百零四匹而奋斗”，并采取了加夜班两小时不停机器的突击办法，后经领导发现才纠正过来。地方国营印染二厂在向工人动员时说：“不要考虑客观条件，能增产多少就增产多少”，于是工人就盲目地增产，第二天，蒸汽供应不上，自来水也不足了。
    中共天津市委工业部在检查这一阶段工作的会议上，向各厂领导方面强调指出了端正领导思想，贯彻在工厂企业中开展增产节约竞赛必须与改善生产管理相结合的方针。（汪溪）
