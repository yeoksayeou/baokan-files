Explanation of Several Common Geological Terms

    Geological Structure: The structural situation of the Earth's surface—the Earth's crust and its constituent units—is collectively called geological structure. The process of change in various geological structural phenomena is geological structural history. Studying geological structural history is helpful for finding minerals; understanding the geological structural situation of a mining area can help us more deeply understand the formation and value of this mining area.
    Mineral Reserve Grade: The classification and grading of mineral reserves is to uniformly divide the quantities of different types and regions of minerals into several categories and levels, according to the degree of understanding of their quantity, quality, and technical indicators during the exploration and research process. The higher the category or level of reserves, the deeper the understanding, the greater the accuracy represented by the reserve figures, that is, the smaller the difference from the actual reserves. In order to adequately ensure the safety of state investments in mineral development, and to correctly determine the investment, mining, and utilization methods and steps, the design of these enterprise construction projects must have highly reliable reserve figures as a basis. When carrying out long-term plans for national economic construction and further detailed exploration plans for certain minerals, reserves with lower reliability can be used as data for the plan. Mineral reserves are divided into three categories and five levels: (1) Class A reserves, including A1 and A2 levels, the allowable error rate of the former should not exceed 10%, and the latter should not exceed 20%; (2) Class B reserves, with only one level, the allowable error rate should not exceed 30%; (3) Class C reserves, with no specified error rate, Class C reserves are further divided into C1 and C2 levels according to the size of the reliability.
    Geological Observation Point: The measurement and production of geological maps (ground or tunnel) is the most fundamental work of geological exploration. This requires arranging "points" of appropriate density according to rock outcrops, specific geological conditions, and the requirements of various geological maps. At these "points," observe and record all possible geological symbols that can be observed locally and nearby, and make precise and correct observations and detailed records of certain important phenomena. These points are geological observation points, which generally have considerable or even special significance in geology. Geological maps can be made based on the observations and records of the observation points.
    Exploration Design: The specific design of various exploration works necessary to determine mineral reserves (including quantity, quality, and technical indicators) is called exploration design. The content includes the measurement and production of geological maps, trench exploration (mining work by excavating shallow and long trenches on the surface), shallow well exploration (mining work by excavating square shallow wells on the surface), pit exploration (mining work by excavating deep and long tunnels in horizontal, vertical or oblique directions), geophysical exploration (mining work using instruments to measure the characteristics of certain physical properties of underground rocks and ores), drilling exploration (mining work by drilling from the ground to deep places with drilling rigs), sampling (collection of ground and underground ore samples), and the specific arrangement, progress, and result estimation of other works.
    Exploration Procedure: The series of construction procedures necessary for mineral exploration is called the exploration procedure. Generally, first conduct relatively rough surface geological work (including the measurement and production of geological maps and appropriate trench and well exploration work), sometimes also coordinated with rough geophysical exploration and exploratory pit and drilling exploration work, to obtain a basic understanding of the quality and quantity of minerals; then, according to the specific situation, conduct more precise geological work (surface and underground), large-scale geophysical exploration (when necessary), and drilling or pit exploration work, to obtain higher-level mineral reserves. Violating or skipping exploration procedures often delays the progress of exploration, or even causes major losses in exploration work, thus wasting people's property and delaying national construction.
    Hydrogeology: Hydrogeological work in the mining area is to investigate whether the ore body is damaged due to water, whether it affects the utilization of the ore body, and whether there is sufficient water source for building a factory.
    Profile Map: A profile map is created by arranging the sequence of strata one by one according to geological structure and topography. Before drilling, the inferred underground conditions based on surface geology are used to draw an ideal profile map, which is used to determine the location of the ore layer and arrange exploration. After drilling, a true profile map can be drawn, which is used to understand the distribution and thickness of the ore body and calculate the ore quantity.
    Strike, Dip: The horizontal extension direction of a rock layer or ore body is called the strike; the downward extension direction of a rock layer or ore body is called the dip.
    Channel Sampling Method: The channel sampling method is a method of collecting ore samples by chiseling shallow, long, equal-depth, and equal-width channels at a certain distance on the cut plane of the ore body on the surface (outcrop, trench or shallow well) or in the tunnel. Usually, all samples in the groove are collected, and then divided into sections and grades according to the specified length (half a meter, one meter, one and a half meters, two meters, or more than two meters) and ore grade adopted according to the specific situation. All mineral samples in each section are mixed as one sample, and then reduced in quantity to a certain extent by quartering or other methods under the principle of not hindering representativeness, and sent for testing or other experimental research. The advantage of the channel sampling method is that the collected mineral samples have accurate representativeness.
    Heavy Sand Sampling Method: This is a method of collecting heavier mineral sand grains in unconsolidated, loose sediments or accumulations (sand, gravel, etc.) on the surface (above the bedrock). Generally, according to specific geological conditions, determine an appropriate sampling distance, and collect an appropriate weight of the original "sand sample" in river valleys or gentle mountain slopes, and use a heavy sand panning dish to pan for heavier sand grains—heavy sand, often gold, tin, tungsten, mercury, diamonds or other heavier minerals can be found.
    Geochemical Exploration: This is a method of exploring minerals (mainly metal minerals) using geochemical methods or biogeochemical methods. It mainly analyzes the trace amounts of certain elements (such as copper, tin, etc.) or their compounds in the soil and weathered rock debris, or in the ash of ordinary plants growing on them, to find abnormal areas with high content, study the distribution patterns of trace elements in these abnormal areas, and then track and explore underground ore bodies.
    Geophysical Exploration: Geophysical exploration is the application of physics to mineral exploration science and technology. Generally, instruments, mainly physical instruments, are used to explore hidden ore bodies.

    若干普通地质名词的解释
    地质构造：地球的表层——地壳及其组成单元的结构情况，统称地质构造；各种地质构造现象的变动经过，就是地质构造史。研究地质构造史，有助于找矿；探明一个矿区的地质构造情况，可以帮助我们更深刻地认识这个矿区的生成及其价值。
    矿产储量等级：矿产储量的分类与分级是把不同种类和不同地区的矿量，按照勘探和研究过程中对其数量、质量及技术指数各方面的了解程度，统一的划分为若干类别与级别。储量的类别或级别愈高，表示了解的程度愈深，储量数字所表示的准确性愈大，亦即与实际储量间的差别愈小。为了相当的保证国家对于矿产开发所进行投资的安全性，并能正确地决定投资和开采利用的方式与步骤，在进行这些企业建设的设计时，必须有可靠性较高的储量数字作为根据。在进行国民经济建设的远景计划以及对于某些矿产作进一步的精密勘探计划时，则可靠性较低的储量，即可作为计划所根据的资料。矿产储量分为三类五级：即（一）A（甲）类储量，包括A1（甲1）A2（甲2）两级，前者的允许误差率不得超过百分之十，后者不得超过百分之二十；（二）B（乙）类储量，仅有一级，允许误差率不得超过百分之三十，（三）C（丙）类储量，误差率没有规定，丙级储量中又根据可靠性的大小分为C1（丙1）C2（丙2）两级。
    地质观测点：地质图（地面或坑道）的测制是地质勘探的最根本工作，这就需要根据岩石出露和具体地质情况以及各种地质图的要求，布置适当密度的“点”，在这些“点”的地方观测和记录当地和附近一切可能观察到的地质象征，对于某些重要现象尤应作精密而正确的观察和详尽的记录。这些点就是地质观测点，一般讲来在地质上是具有相当以至特殊意义的。根据观测点的观察和记录，可制成地质图。
    勘探设计：探明矿产储量（包括数量、质量和技术指数）所必需的各种勘探工作的具体设计称为勘探设计。内容包括地质图测制，槽探（在地表挖掘浅长沟道的探矿工作），浅井探（在地表所挖方形浅井的探矿工作），坑探（向水平、垂直或斜深方向开掘深长坑道的探矿工作），地球物理探矿（利用仪器测定地下岩石和矿石的某些物理性质的特征的探矿工作），钻探（用钻机从地面向深处钻进的探矿工作），采样（地面及地下矿石样品的采集）等工作的具体布置，进度和成果的估计等等。
    勘探程序：矿产勘探所必须的一系列的施工程序称为勘探程序。一般先进行较粗略的地面地质工作（包括地质图的测制和适当的槽井探工作），有时也配合粗略的地球物理探矿和试探性的坑探和钻探工作，以求对矿产的质和量有基本的了解；然后根据具体情况进行较精密的地质工作（地面及地下），大规模的地球物理探矿（必要时）以及钻探或坑探等工作，以求得较高级的矿产储量。违反或跨越勘探程序往往反而推迟了勘探的进展，甚至使勘探工作遭受重大的损失，因而浪费了人民财产与延迟了国家的建设。
    水文地质：矿区内的水文地质工作是调查矿体是否因水的关系而遭破坏，是否影响对矿体的利用，以及建厂有无足够的水源等。
    剖面图：根据地质构造和地形，把地层的顺序一一排列绘出，即成剖面图。在打钻以前，凭借地面地质对地下的推测，绘制的是理想剖面图，作用是判断矿层所在位置及布置探矿。打钻以后，才能绘制真实的剖面图，作用是明解矿体之展布、厚度及计算矿量。
    走向、倾斜：岩层或矿体水平延展的方向，谓之走向；岩层或矿体向下伸展的方向，谓之倾斜。
    刻槽取样法：刻槽取样法是在地表（露头上，探槽或浅井中）或坑道的矿体削平面上，按一定的距离凿刻浅长、等深、等宽的沟道，以采取矿石样品的方法。通常都收集槽中全部样品，然后按根据具体情况所采用的规定长度（半公尺、一公尺、一公尺半、二公尺、或二公尺以上）及矿石品位分段分级，每段的全部矿样加以混合作为一个样品，再用四分法或其他方法，在不妨碍代表性的原则下缩减数量至一定程度，送交化验或作其他试验研究。刻槽取样法的优点是采集的矿样有准确的代表性。
    重砂取样法：这是在地表（岩盘以上）的未黏结、疏松的沉积或堆积物（沙土、砾石等）中采取较重的矿物的砂粒的方法。一般根据具体地质情况，决定适当的采样距离，在河谷或平缓山坡上采取适当重量的原“砂样”，用重砂淘洗盘淘取较重的砂粒——重砂，往往可以发现金、锡、钨、汞、金刚石或其他较重的矿物。
    地球化学探矿：这是利用地球化学方法或生物地球化学方法勘探矿产（主要是金属矿）的方法。主要是分析土壤及风化的岩石散块中，或其上生长的普通植物灰分中某些元素（如铜、锡……等）或其化合物微迹的量，找寻其高含量的不正常区，研究这些不正常区内元素微迹的散布型式，从而追踪寻探地下的矿体。
    地球物理探矿：地球物理探矿是物理学应用于探矿的科学技术，一般是用仪器，主要是物理仪器来探寻隐伏矿体。
