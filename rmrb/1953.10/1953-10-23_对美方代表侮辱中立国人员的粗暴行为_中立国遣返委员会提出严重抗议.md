Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 22nd: The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) today lodged a strong protest with the U.S. side regarding the rude insult of an NNRC officer by a U.S. representative during explanation work. The NNRC demanded that the U.S. side caution their representatives to be more dignified in their actions and words and to give appropriate punishment to those who have committed offenses. During the explanation work in Dongchang-ri, U.S. representatives, observer representatives, and interpreters consistently disregarded the orders of the chairman of the NNRC's subsidiary bodies, willfully intimidating prisoners of war and demanding that they oppose repatriation.

The protest lodged by the NNRC to the U.S. side is as follows:

"The Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission respectfully requests that the United Nations Command pay attention to the following incident reported to this Commission by Mr. Stanisław Gajewski, the Polish representative to the Commission.

At approximately 5:15 PM on October 17, 1953, a representative of the Polish delegation supervising operations in "A" Explanation Area was rudely insulted by a representative of the United Nations Command, who called him a "son of a bitch". A dispatch issued by the Associated Press on that day already reported this incident. The following is a quote from that dispatch: 'The prisoners of war's opposition to "brainwashing" has spread to the American officers on Saturday, one of whom called a Polish officer a son of a bitch.'

This Commission lodges a serious protest against the behavior of the aforementioned officer and requests that this officer be given appropriate punishment. At the same time, it requests that the United Nations Command ensure that their representatives are instructed to be more restrained and dignified in their actions and words. The Chairman would be pleased to be informed of the measures taken by the United Nations Command regarding the issues raised in this protest."

    对美方代表侮辱中立国人员的粗暴行为
    中立国遣返委员会提出严重抗议
    【新华社开城二十二日电】中立国遣返委员会今天就在进行解释工作时一个美方代表对中立国遣返委员会的一名军官进行粗暴的侮辱一事向美方提出严重抗议。中立国遣返委员会要求美方告诫他们的代表在行动和言语方面要庄重一些，并对犯有过失者给予适当的惩罚。在东场里进行解释工作时，美方代表、观察代表和译员始终不理会中立国遣返委员会附属机构主席的命令，恣意威吓战俘，要他们反对遣返。
    中立国遣返委员会向美方提出的抗议如下：
    “中立国遣返委员会主席谨要求联合国军司令部注意本委员会波兰代表斯坦尼斯瓦夫·加耶夫斯基先生向本委员会报告的下列事件。
    一九五三年十月十七日下午五时十五分左右，在‘A’解释区执行监督工作的波兰代表团的一位代表受到联合国军司令部的一个代表的粗暴侮辱，那个代表骂他是‘婊子养的’。合众社记者在那一天发出的一条电讯中已报道了这个事件。下面是从那条电讯中引的一句话：‘战俘们反对“洗脑筋”的做法星期六已散布到美国军官中间，他们当中有一个人曾骂一个波兰军官是婊子养的。’
    本委员会对上述军官的行为提出严重抗议，要求给这个军官以适当的惩罚。同时要求联合国军司令部保证指示他们的代表在行动和言语方面要检点一些，庄重一些。如蒙告知联合国军司令部对此抗议所说的问题所采取的措施，本主席将感到欣慰。”
