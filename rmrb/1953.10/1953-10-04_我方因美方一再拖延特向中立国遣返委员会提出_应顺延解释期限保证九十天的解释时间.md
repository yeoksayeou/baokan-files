Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 3rd—Our side has requested the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to extend the interpretation period to guarantee ninety days of interpretation time because of the US side's repeated delays.

The interpretation and visiting work conducted by both sides of the Korean Armistice Agreement towards all non-directly repatriated prisoners of war dependent on their respective sides was originally scheduled to begin on September 26th. Subsequently, because the additional regulations concerning interpretation work were not prepared at that time, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission decided to postpone the ninety-day interpretation period stipulated in the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" by five days, starting from October 1st. However, due to the US side's continued unreasonable delays in the construction of the interpretation camp, the interpretation and visiting work has not yet begun.

Originally, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission had already determined that the detaining side of the prisoners of war should respect the requests made by the interpreting side when constructing the interpretation camp for the interpreting side's use. The Korean-Chinese side had also expressed its willingness to construct the interpretation camp for the US side's use at the location designated by the US side, according to the internal design provided by the US side. However, the US side refused to construct the interpretation camp for the Korean-Chinese side at the above-mentioned location, using the excuse that the location designated by the Korean-Chinese side and agreed upon by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was low-lying and damp, and that the landmines had not been cleared. The US side insisted that the Korean-Chinese side use the interpretation camp originally prepared by the US side, which was close to the US military control area and opposed by the Korean-Chinese side. It should be pointed out that on September 13th, Mr. Bryan, the senior member of the US side on the Military Armistice Commission, informed the Korean-Chinese side that the US side had cleared the landmines in the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone in accordance with the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The area designated by the Korean-Chinese side was not low-lying or damp. Therefore, the US side's so-called excuses of low-lying, damp terrain and uncleared landmines are baseless. The reason why the US side insists that the Korean-Chinese side use the interpretation camp close to the US military control area is entirely to facilitate its sabotage of the interpretation work. The Korean-Chinese side resolutely opposes this.

In order to ensure that the interpretation work can begin quickly and is no longer delayed due to the US side's obstruction, the Korean-Chinese side made a concrete suggestion to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on September 30th, namely: to make urgent arrangements at the location designated by the interpretation representatives of each party in each detention camp to construct the most necessary facilities first, so that the interpretation work could begin on October 1st. The liaison officer of the Korean-Chinese side also confirmed to the representative of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission at the Dongchang-ri site, where non-directly repatriated Korean-Chinese prisoners of war are held, that there were no difficulties in setting up the interpretation facilities requested by the Korean-Chinese side at the location designated by the Korean-Chinese side. However, the Korean-Chinese side has not yet received notification from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission that the US side will conduct construction at the location designated by the Korean-Chinese side. The responsibility for the failure of the interpretation work to begin on schedule on October 1st lies entirely with the US side.

At present, the start of the interpretation work cannot be delayed any longer. The Korean-Chinese side has begun to construct the interpretation camp for the US side's use in accordance with the US side's requirements for the location of the interpretation camp and its internal design. The Korean-Chinese side is requesting the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to immediately notify the US side to begin constructing the interpretation camp for the Korean-Chinese side's use at the location designated by the Korean-Chinese side, according to the design proposed by the Korean-Chinese side, and to inform the Korean-Chinese side of the start date of the interpretation work. The Korean-Chinese side has also proposed to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission that the postponement of the interpretation period resulting from the US side's repeated obstruction should be extended in accordance with the method decided by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, in order to guarantee ninety days of interpretation time.

    我方因美方一再拖延特向中立国遣返委员会提出
    应顺延解释期限保证九十天的解释时间
    【新华社开城三日电】朝鲜停战双方向一切依附于其本方的不直接遣返的战俘所进行的解释与访问工作，原应于九月二十六日开始，嗣因有关解释工作的附加规定在当时尚未准备妥当，经中立国遣返委员会决定，将“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”所规定的九十天解释期限顺延五天，自十月一日开始。但由于美方仍继续在修建解释营场工作上，故意采取无理的拖延态度，以致解释与访问工作迄今尚未开始。
    本来中立国遣返委员会早已确定：战俘原拘留一方在修建供解释一方使用的解释营场时，应尊重解释一方所提要求的原则。朝中方面也早已表示愿在美方所指定的地点，按照美方所提出的内部设计图样，修建供美方使用的解释营场。但美方则以朝中方面所指定并经中立国遣返委员会所同意之地点低洼潮湿、地雷又未消除为藉口，拒绝根据上述原则，在该地点修建供朝中方面使用的解释营场，硬要朝中方面使用美方原所准备而为朝中方面所反对的紧靠美方军事控制地区的解释营场。应该指出：军事停战委员会美方首席委员勃里安在九月十三日，曾通知朝中方面称，美方已根据朝鲜停战协定的规定，清除了非军事区南部的地雷，而朝中方面所指定的地区更非低洼潮湿之地，因此美方所提出的所谓地形低洼潮湿、地雷并未清除的藉口，是毫无根据的。美方所以硬要朝中方面使用紧靠美方军事控制地区的解释营场，完全是为了便于其破坏解释工作。对此，朝中方面坚决表示反对。
    为使解释工作能迅速开始，不再因美方的阻挠而有所延迟，朝中方面曾在九月三十日向中立国遣返委员会提出具体建议，即：在各看管营地中各方解释代表所指定的地点，进行紧急安排，先行修建最必要的设备，以便十月一日得以开始解释工作。朝中方面联络官并在收容不直接遣返之朝中被俘人员之东场里现场，向中立国遣返委员会的代表证实，在朝中方面所指定的地点设置朝中方面所要求的解释设备，是不存在任何困难的。但朝中方面迄今尚未从中立国遣返委员会得到美方在朝中方面指定地点进行修建的通知，解释工作之不能按期在十月一日开始，其责任完全在于美方。
    目下解释工作的开始已不容再拖，朝中方面已按照美方对于解释营场的地点及其内部设计的要求，开始修建供美方使用之解释营场。朝中方面正要求中立国遣返委员会立即通知美方在朝中方面所指定的地点，按照朝中方面所提出的设计，开始修建供朝中方面使用的解释营场，并请中立国遣返委员会将解释工作的开始日期通知朝中方面。朝中方面并已向中立国遣返委员会提出，因美方一再阻挠而产生的解释期限之推迟，应根据中立国遣返委员会所决定的办法，予以顺延，以保证九十天的解释时间。
