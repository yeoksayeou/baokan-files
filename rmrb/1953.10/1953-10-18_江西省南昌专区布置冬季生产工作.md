The Nanchang Special Office of Jiangxi Province convened an enlarged meeting of the heads of agriculture and forestry departments and deputy directors of agricultural technology guidance stations of various counties from September 14th to 21st. The meeting focused on discussing and deploying tasks such as winter plowing, winter planting, pest extermination, fertilizer accumulation, and farmland water conservancy construction, in order to increase grain production, prevent spring and summer famine next year, and lay the foundation for increased agricultural production next year.

This year, the Nanchang Special District suffered from floods and droughts, which affected the completion of the annual grain production increase task. Therefore, the meeting considered that expanding winter planting, increasing production, and increasing income were of great significance. At the meeting, after repeated discussions, it was decided that the winter planting area for the entire special district this year would be 7,808,000 mu, accounting for 65.42% of the total cultivated land area, an increase of more than 25% compared to the actual winter planting area last year. Among them, early-maturing crops accounted for 2,876,000 mu (including rapeseed, wheat, barley, broad beans, peas, and vegetables, etc.), and green manure crops accounted for 4,932,000 mu.

The meeting unanimously agreed that in areas severely affected by drought, more early-maturing crops should be planted to produce more grain to prevent famine in the spring and summer of next year. In areas less affected or not affected by disasters, more green manure crops should be planted to prepare more fertilizer for increasing grain production next year. In addition, in leading winter production, all idle winter fields are required to be winter-plowed, pests exterminated, weeds on field ridges removed, and a large amount of fertilizer accumulated. In addition, 30,881 water conservancy projects should be built and repaired to enhance drought resistance and expand the irrigated area. In terms of constructing dikes, 6.5 million cubic meters of earthwork needs to be completed.

At the beginning of the meeting, some comrades did not fully understand the favorable conditions for completing winter plowing, winter planting, and leading winter production, and believed that there were many difficulties, lacking sufficient confidence in expanding the winter planting area; another part of the comrades ignored the actual difficulties, thus being blindly optimistic, believing that winter planting was easy to complete. After detailed discussions and analysis, everyone clearly recognized the favorable conditions and existing difficulties, and found solutions to the difficulties, and worked hard with full confidence to complete the winter production tasks.

    江西省南昌专区布置冬季生产工作
    江西省南昌专署于九月十四日至二十一日，召开了各县农林科长、农业技术指导站副站长扩大会议。会议上着重讨论与布置了冬耕、冬种、灭虫、积肥及兴修农田水利等工作，以增产粮食，预防明年春夏荒，并为明年农业增产打下基础。
    南昌专区今年由于水旱灾害的袭击，影响了全年粮食增产任务的完成。因此，会议认为扩大冬种，增加生产，增加收入，有着重大的意义。会上，经过反复讨论后，确定全专区今年冬种面积为七百八十万零八千余亩，占总耕地面积的百分之六十五点四二，比去年实际冬种面积增加百分之二十五强。其中早熟作物是二百八十七万六千余亩（包括油菜、小麦、大麦、蚕豆、豌豆和蔬菜等），绿肥作物四百九十三万二千亩。
    会议一致认为：在受旱灾较严重的地区，要多种早熟作物，多打粮食，以预防明年的春、夏荒。在受灾较轻或没有受灾的地区，要多种绿肥作物，为明年增产粮食准备更多的肥料。此外，在领导冬季生产中，要求全部冬闲田进行冬耕、灭虫，铲除田墈杂草，并大量积肥。另外还要兴修和补修水利工程三万零八百八十一处，增强抗旱能力，扩大灌溉面积。在兴修圩堤方面，需完成土方工程六百五十万公方。
    会议开始时，曾有部分同志对完成冬耕、冬种及领导冬季生产的有利条件了解不够，认为困难很多，对扩大冬种面积缺乏足够的信心；另一部分同志忽视了实际困难，因而盲目乐观，认为冬种很容易完成。经过详细讨论、分析，大家明确认识了有利条件和存在的困难，并找出了解决困难的办法后，都满怀信心地为完成冬季生产任务而努力。
