Lofty Honor
    ——On the Sports Team of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    At the 1953 National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Championships, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) team achieved first place in the overall track and field team score with 140 points. They also achieved remarkable results in gymnastics and cycling competitions. Over the past six days, their outstanding athletic performance, spirit of unity and mutual assistance, eagerness to learn, obedience to leadership, and strict adherence to all the rules of the competition have left a deep impression on the attending spectators. They have set a shining example for athletes and sports workers nationwide.

    The PLA team won 11 championships out of the 47 events in the entire competition, earning a total of 28 gold medals, 21 silver medals, and 31 other medals. Sixty-eight of the team's 82 athletes achieved rankings. These included Shi Qin (2 minutes and 3 seconds) in the men's 800 meters, Yan Zhangzhao (4 minutes and 7.2 seconds) in the men's 1500 meters, Yi Tao Tege (15 minutes and 48 seconds) in the men's 5000 meters, Gao Shugui (6 meters and 93 centimeters) in the men's long jump, Jiang Yumin (1 minute and 2.7 seconds) in the women's 400 meters, Wen Liping (2 minutes and 33.1 seconds) in the women's 800 meters, Luo Yunqi (12 meters and 19 centimeters) in the women's shot put, and Yang Yizhuang (34 meters and 12 centimeters) in the women's javelin throw, all of whom broke national records. In the men's cycling 1500 meters, 5000 meters, and 10,000 meters, as well as the women's cycling 3000 meters, athletes Qian Huaiyu, Jiang Defu, and Zhang Xinmei respectively won first place, setting new national records. In addition, new national records were also set in the men's 1500-meter medley relay, the men's 1600-meter relay, and the women's 1000-meter medley relay. This shows that the PLA team not only includes outstanding athletes who set new national records, but also boasts balanced and widespread development across the team.

    The members of the PLA team fully demonstrated the spirit of revolutionary heroism during the competition, with many athletes breaking their own previous records. For example, female javelin thrower Yang Yizhuang’s best performance in past training tests was 31 meters, but this time she reached 34 meters and 12 centimeters. Men's 1500-meter champion Yan Zhangzhao also far exceeded his original score, breaking the national record with 4 minutes and 7.2 seconds to take first place in this event.

    The glorious achievements of the PLA team in this sports competition are inseparable from the vigorous promotion and emphasis on sports by the Communist Party and military leaders. The heroic PLA has always attached great importance to sports. As early as 1929, Chairman Mao, in the resolution written for the Ninth Party Congress of the Fourth Red Army, included the development of sports activities as one of the training tasks of the troops. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De also included physical exercise as part of military training and personally took the lead in participating in various sports activities to lead the sports work of the troops. Therefore, in the Red Army at that time, there were often sports competitions between companies, battalions, regiments, and even divisions and armies. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, during frequent battles, Commander He Long also organized and led the famous "Combat Basketball Team" to promote sports activities in the troops. The Communist Party and military leaders' advocacy and care for sports laid a good foundation for sports in the PLA.

    With the development of the victorious revolutionary situation and the active promotion of the military leadership, the First All-Army Propaganda, Education, and Cultural Work Conference in 1950 made a decision on carrying out recreational and sports activities in the troops. In 1951, the All-Army held basketball and volleyball competitions, and in 1952, the All-Army held the "August 1st" Sports Games. In this competition, athletes achieved excellent results. Through this competition, sports activities flourished in all units of the PLA.

    The athletes of the PLA team who participated in this competition have consistently followed the instructions of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De: "Develop sports and enhance the people's physique," and "Train ourselves to become iron-willed, and defend our most beloved country." They have worked hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and have diligently studied and practiced under the principle of "all-round development, focusing on improvement," rapidly improving and consolidating their technical level in various sports. For example, Wen Liping, who broke the national record in the women's 800 meters and won first place in this event, persevered in training herself in the severe winter of Lanzhou, braving the wind and snow every morning to practice running with her male comrades. She also did various auxiliary exercises before going to bed, laying a good foundation for endurance and physical fitness. Another example is Qian Huaiyu, the champion of the men's cycling 1500 meters. He persisted in training for a long time. When stationed in Nanjing, because there were no suitable training grounds, he often rode his bicycle to Tangshan (about 80 li from Nanjing). As a result of this training, he enhanced his endurance and improved his skills in fast cycling. In this competition, he gloriously won two gold medals and one silver medal.

    Although the PLA team achieved good results in this competition, they are not complacent. In the competition, they also humbly learned a lot of valuable experience from other fraternal teams. They plan to bring back these valuable experiences, continue to study hard and practice diligently, further improve their existing achievements, and strive to further promote mass sports activities in the troops.

### 崇高的荣誉——记中国人民解放军体育代表队

    崇高的荣誉
    ——记中国人民解放军体育代表队
    在一九五三年全国田径、体操、自行车运动大会上，中国人民解放军代表队以一百四十分取得田径赛团体总分第一名，体操和自行车比赛中，也得到卓越的成就。六天以来，他们在大会上所表现的优异运动成绩和团结互助、虚心学习、服从领导与严格遵守大会一切规则的新体育道德作风，给到会参观群众留下了深刻的印象，为全国运动员和体育工作者树立了光辉的榜样。
    中国人民解放军代表队总共取得大会全部竞赛四十七项中的十一项冠军，共获得金质奖章二十八枚、银质奖章二十一枚和其他奖章三十一枚。全队八十二名选手有六十八名取得了名次，其中如男子八百公尺冠军获得者石勤（二分点三秒），男子一千五百公尺冠军获得者严章照（四分七秒二），男子五千公尺冠军获得者伊套特格（十五分四十八秒），男子跳远冠军获得者高树贵（六公尺九十三公分），女子四百公尺冠军获得者姜玉民（一分二秒七），女子八百公尺冠军获得者温丽萍（二分三十三秒一），女子推铅球冠军获得者罗运琪（十二公尺十九公分），女子掷标枪冠军获得者杨一庄（三十四公尺十二公分）等都打破了全国最高纪录。男子自行车一千五百公尺、五千公尺和一万公尺以及女子自行车三千公尺比赛，运动员钱怀玉、姜德富和张信梅分别获得第一名，创造了全国新纪录。此外，男子一千五百公尺异程接力、男子一千六百公尺接力和女子一千公尺异程接力，也创造了全国新纪录。这说明中国人民解放军代表队不仅包括有创造全国新纪录的优秀选手，而且全队的发展也是平衡普遍的。
    中国人民解放军代表队的队员们，在大会中充分发扬了革命英雄主义的精神，有很多队员都打破了自己原来的纪录。比如女子标枪选手杨一庄，在过去练习测验中最好的成绩是三十一公尺，这次达到了三十四公尺十二公分；男子一千五百公尺冠军严章照，也远远超过他原来的成绩，以四分七秒二打破全国纪录，取得这一项的第一名。
    中国人民解放军代表队，在这次运动大会上获得的光辉成就，是与共产党和部队首长对体育运动大力倡导与重视分不开的。英雄的人民解放军，对体育运动素来就很重视。远在一九二九年，毛主席为红四军第九次党的代表大会写的决议中，就把开展体育运动，列为部队训练工作内容之一。朱总司令也把体育锻炼列为练兵的内容之一，并且亲自带头参加各种体育活动，来领导部队的体育工作。因而在当时红军中，就常常有连与连、营与营、团与团以至师、军之间的体育比赛。抗日战争初期，在战斗频繁的日子里，贺龙司令员还组织和领导有名的“战斗篮球队”，在部队中推广体育活动。共产党和部队首长对体育运动的倡导和关怀使得体育运动在人民解放军中打下了良好的基础。
    随着革命胜利形势发展和部队领导上的积极提倡，一九五○年第一届全军宣传、教育、文化工作会议上曾作了关于开展部队文娱体育活动的决定。一九五一年全军举行了篮、排球竞赛大会，一九五二年全军又举行了“八一”体育运动大会。在这次大会中，运动员们获得了优异的成绩。通过这次大会，体育运动便在人民解放军各部队中蓬勃开展了。
    参加这次大会的中国人民解放军代表队运动员们一贯是遵循着毛主席和朱总司令的指示：“发展体育运动，增强人民体质。”“锻炼自己成为铁的体质，保卫我们最可爱的国家。”他们努力学习苏联先进的经验，在“全面发展，重点提高”的教育与训练的原则下，勤学苦练，很快地提高和巩固了各项体育运动技术水平。如打破女子八百公尺全国最高纪录、荣获此次大会女子八百公尺第一名的温丽萍，她在兰州严寒的冬季里不间断的锻炼着自己，每天早晨冒着风雪和男同志们一齐练习跑步，睡前还作各种辅助运动，打下了较好的耐久力量和体质基础。又如男子自行车一千五百公尺冠军获得者钱怀玉，他长期坚持锻炼，在南京驻防时，因为没有合适的练习场地，就经常骑车跑汤山（离南京约八十华里），这样锻炼的结果，增强了他的耐久力量和提高了他快速骑车的技术。在这次大会中，他光荣地获得了二枚金质奖章和一枚银质奖章。
    中国人民解放军代表队，在这次大会中虽然获得了良好的成绩，但是他们并不以此感到满足。在比赛中他们还虚心的向其他兄弟代表队学习了不少宝贵的经验。他们准备把这些宝贵的经验带回去，继续勤学苦练，把自己现有的成绩再提高一步，为进一步开展部队群众性体育运动而努力。
