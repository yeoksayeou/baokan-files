At the beginning of the autumn harvest, the Yanggao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province organized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside to mobilize and deploy the movement for increasing production and practicing economy. The cadres of the work group who went to Beishaling Village first encountered the problem that cadres and the masses generally lacked confidence in increasing production and practicing economy in the countryside. They believed that increasing production and practicing economy was a matter for factories and government agencies; increasing production in factories amounted to hundreds of millions of yuan, and what could individual households in rural areas do? Most of the masses did not understand the purpose and methods of increasing production and practicing economy. Some people suspected that the burden of public grain would increase this year when they heard about increasing production and practicing economy; although some people knew that the government called on farmers to increase production and practice economy in order to enable farmers to expand reproduction and overcome difficulties in production, which was beneficial to both the country and the farmers, they did not know how to do it. Many people thought that increasing production and practicing economy meant "eating a little thinner when you should be eating thick, and not celebrating the festivals that should be celebrated." The main cadres of the village believed that "when it's time to harvest, everyone will harvest without being told; there's no need for us to lead the autumn harvest, and no one's grain will be lost. It's meddling to worry about this." Some people said, "You still lose a grain of rice when you eat, let alone the autumn harvest!" Others said, "If you don't collect it in the fields, you deduct it in the threshing ground, what more can you squeeze out?"

After the comrades of the work group deeply understood the ideological situation of the cadres and the masses, they first convened meetings of the Party and Youth League branch committees and cadre meetings, carried out mobilization and study, and unified the ideological understanding of the cadres, Party members, and League members. Then, they mobilized all nineteen propagandists in the village to go to the masses to publicize, and at the same time carried out mobilization through the Party, League, women's, and militia organization systems. They used a combination of political education and detailed accounting methods, which achieved great results. First, they enlightened everyone to understand what benefits the national industrial construction had given to the farmers, and to understand the relationship between increasing production and saving grain and national industrial construction; then, they enlightened everyone to think from a broad perspective, focus on details, start everywhere, use their brains, think of ways, and make detailed calculations. Finally, most of the masses realized that it was necessary and possible to increase production and practice economy in the countryside, and discussed many ways to increase production and practice economy.

During the autumn harvest, the village basically achieved "clean fields, clean roads, clean threshing grounds, and clean stalks." When harvesting, they generally harvested carefully, timely, and quickly, using the morning, evening, and cloudy days when it was not easy for the grain to fall to bundle and pull the crops. In order to avoid losses when pulling crops, some people even lined the inside of the carriage with pockets. When threshing, the threshing grounds were wider and cleaner than in previous years. In the past, when cutting sorghum, the bundles were not untied, and many small ears were discarded; this year, Youth League member Zhang Meilian took the lead in untying the bundles and cutting them cleanly and well, which led many people to change the old habit of cutting without untying the bundles. At first, some people thought, "How much can you lose with three or two ears of grain in the threshing ground?" Later, fourteen ears of grain were found in a haystack of Liu Shiming, and everyone calculated carefully that if all the haystacks contained more than a dozen ears of grain, it would be a big loss. After that, the ears of grain were cut longer to avoid losing the ears; the people who bundled the grass also paid attention to checking and searching for the ears of grain. In this way, more than 2,000 jin of grain were lost less than in previous years in the village's 2,280 mu of crops. In order to strive not to lose a single grain of grain, they also mobilized women and children to go to the fields to do a thorough cleaning, and they picked up another twenty pockets of yams.

In the past, pigs were not penned, and rats and weasels ate a lot of grain every year. This year, after everyone's research, it was decided to carry out a pig-penning and rat-killing campaign in the village. Most of the village's more than 170 pigs were penned. The methods of catching rats with cats, trapping them with traps, and blocking rat holes were also very successful. They also came up with a way to dig weasel holes; Party member Lü Tianyuan dug out more than half a bag of cowpeas and a basket of grain ears in the rat hole in half a day. This also reduced a loss.

This year there was a lot of autumn rain, and many yams were spoiled. Everyone dried and stored the ones that could be stored, and used the ones that could not be dried to grind into powder. The village's 20,000 jin of rotten yams produced 1,200 jin of powder, which could be sold for 1.2 million yuan, and the residue was used to feed pigs.

In autumn plowing, they also changed the past habit of livestock plowing for only half a day, and most of them did fine plowing and deep plowing. The village's autumn plowing land can be plowed before October 25. They also plan to draw some surplus labor and animal power to sell labor and transport goods outside, which can also increase some income.

In terms of daily life, everyone put forward the slogan of "saving at the jar mouth" to change the wasteful phenomenon of "eating all autumn regardless of the harvest." Women came up with many ways to avoid wasting rice and flour when cooking, not to waste leftovers, to save all unnecessary expenses, and to try to be meticulous in planning and make a long-term plan.

According to preliminary calculations, the village increased production and saved more than 13,000 jin of grain in the autumn harvest. Everyone is prepared to sell the surplus grain to the state after paying public grain and eating.

Now, many mutual aid groups and individual farmers in Beishaling Village have also formulated plans to continue increasing production and practicing economy after the autumn harvest, determined to increase production and save more grain to support national construction.

    阳高县北沙岭村在秋收中怎样增产节约了一万三千多斤粮食
    董瑞山  郭润田  金元
    秋收开始的时候，中共山西省阳高县委组织了大批干部下乡动员布置增产节约运动。到北沙岭村去的工作组干部，首先遇到的问题是干部和群众普遍对于农村增产节约信心不足。他们认为：增产节约是工厂的事，是政府机关的事；工厂里一增产就是几亿元，农村里一家一户还能顶个啥。大部分群众不明白增产节约的目的和方法。有些人听到要增产节约，就怀疑今年要增加公粮负担；有些人虽然知道政府号召农民增产节约是为了叫农民扩大再生产，克服生产中的困难，对国家对农民都有利，可是不知道怎样做法。不少人认为：增产节约，就是“该吃稠的喝上点稀的，该过的节日也不要过了”。村的主要干部认为：“到该收割的时候，不用说大家也会收割；秋收不用咱领导，谁家的粮食也丢不了。这样操心是多管事。有人说：“吃饭还丢个米粒，别说秋收啦！”还有的说：“田地里不收，场里穷扣，还能闹出什么油水？”
    工作组的同志们深入地了解了干部和群众的思想情况以后，先召开了共产党和青年团的支委会议和干部会议，进行了动员和学习，统一了干部、党员、团员的思想认识。然后，动员了全村十九个宣传员，分片深入向群众宣传，同时通过党、团、妇女、民兵各个组织系统进行了动员。他们运用政治教育和详细算账相结合的方法，收到很大效果。先启发大家认识了国家工业建设给了农民一些什么好处，认识了增产节约粮食和国家工业建设的关系；接着，启发大家从大处着想、小处着眼、处处着手、动脑筋、想办法、算细账。终于，大部分群众都认识到了在农村增产节约是必要的，也是可能的，并且讨论出很多增产节约的办法。
    在秋收中，全村基本上做到了“地净、道净、场净、秸秆净”。收割的时候，一般都能收得细致，收得适时，收得快，利用早上、晚上和阴天不易落粒的时间捆、拉庄稼。为了避免拉庄稼时的损失，有的还在车厢内铺上口袋。打场时，场面都比往年打扫得宽，而且干净。过去切高粱都不解捆，许多小穗就被丢掉了；今年青年团员张美莲首先解开捆切，切得又净又好，带动很多人改变了不解捆就切的旧习惯。起初有人以为“场里三穗两穗能丢多少？”后来从刘士明的一个干草捆里找出了十四个谷穗，大家算算细账，如果所有的干草捆中都夹十几个谷穗，就是一笔大损失。以后切谷穗时就放长一些，避免丢掉穗子；捆草的人也注意了检查，把谷穗搜净。这样，全村二千二百八十亩庄稼，就比往年少损失二千多斤粮食。为了争取不丢一粒粮食，他们又发动妇女儿童下地，作一次彻底的清理，光山药就又拾回来二十口袋。
    过去养猪不圈，加上老鼠、黄鼠偷吃，每年都要糟踏很多粮食。今年经过大家研究，决定在全村开展圈猪打鼠运动。村内一百七十多口猪大部分都圈上了。用猫捕、夹子打、堵鼠洞等办法治老鼠，成绩也很大。他们还想出了挖黄鼠洞的办法；党员吕天元一个人小半天工夫就在鼠洞里挖出大半口袋豆角和一筐子谷穗。这就又减少了一笔损失。
    今年秋雨多，很多山药坏了。大家把可以收藏的晒干收藏，不能晒的用来磨粉。全村两万斤烂山药，出了一千二百斤粉，可卖一百二十万元，还落下渣子喂猪。
    在秋耕中，也改变了过去牲畜只耕半日的习惯，大部作到了细耕和深耕，全村秋耕地在十月二十五日以前就可以耕完。他们还准备抽一部分剩余劳动力和畜力出外卖工和运输，也可以增加一部分收入。
    日常生活方面，大家提出了“瓮口节约”的口号，改变过去“收不收，吃一秋”的浪费现象。妇女们想出许多办法，做饭时不浪费米面、不糟踏剩饭，节省一切不必要的开支，尽量做到精打细算，细水长流。
    初步计算一下，全村在秋收中共增产节约了一万三千多斤粮食。大家准备除了缴公粮和食用外，把多余的粮食都卖给国家。
    现在北沙岭村不少互助组和个体农民又订出了秋后继续增产节约的计划，决心增产节约更多的粮食支援国家建设。
