The membership representative conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce opens today, and this conference also announces the establishment of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, marking the unprecedented unity of industrialists and businessmen across the country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government. I extend warm congratulations to the conference.

Starting this year, our country has entered a period of large-scale construction on the basis of the successful recovery of the national economy and has begun to implement the first five-year construction plan. Our various democratic parties, people's organizations, and the people of the whole country will follow the general line instructed by the great Chairman Mao, that is, in a fairly long period of time, we will work together to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce by the state.

At present, private industrialists and businessmen still account for a considerable proportion of the entire industry and commerce. In the process of gradually realizing the socialist industrialization of the country, it is necessary to correctly play their role; and in terms of gradually realizing socialist transformation, transforming private industry and commerce is a major link. This gives the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce the task of inspiring and encouraging the business enthusiasm of private industrialists and businessmen, promoting and assisting them in enterprise transformation, and guiding private capitalist economy to gradually move towards the path of state capitalism as needed and possible, on the basis of broadly uniting all types of industrialists and businessmen.

In the past four years, private industrialists and businessmen have made certain contributions in restoring and developing production, material exchanges, and participating in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. In the future, in the process of the country's planned large-scale economic construction, they will be required to exert greater enthusiasm and make more contributions. Since private industrialists and businessmen received a profound education in the "Five-Anti" movement, their political awareness has improved, and they are generally able to reduce the "five poisons" and the blindness, speculation, and destructiveness of their operations, obey the management of the People's Government, accept the leadership of the state-owned economy and the supervision of the masses of workers, and engage in the operation of enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. However, it should not be ignored that even after the "Five-Anti" movement, some private industrialists and businessmen are still trying to evade the leadership of the state-owned economy and the supervision of the masses of workers, repeating the old path of blind competition, and even repeating the "five poisons." This is an obstacle to the country's move towards planned construction today. It should be pointed out that the interests of the state and the people are the highest interests, which are absolutely not allowed to be damaged or infringed upon.

Facing the work before the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, I think it should be to closely connect with the masses, carry out political and ideological education, promote the country's general line and general tasks, assist the government in solving specific problems in the socialist transformation of enterprises, and encourage their business enthusiasm with the development of enterprise transformation. Secondly, in the nationwide increase production and practice economy campaign, local federations of industry and commerce should play an active role in calling on and promoting private industry and commerce, and create favorable conditions for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce.

    中国人民政协全国委员会副主席李济深的致词（摘要）
    中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会今天开幕，这次大会并宣告中华全国工商业联合会的成立，标志全国工商业者在中国共产党和中央人民政府领导之下，实现了历史上从所未有的大团结。我向大会致以热烈的祝贺。
    从今年起，我们的国家已从国民经济胜利恢复的基础上，进入大规模建设时期，开始执行第一个五年建设计划。我们各民主党派、各人民团体和全国人民都将按着伟大的毛主席所指示的总路线，即在一个相当长的时期内，为逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对私营工商业的社会主义改造而共同奋斗。
    目前私营工商业者在整个工商业中间，还占有相当的比重。在逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化过程中，需要正确地发挥他们的作用；而在逐步实现社会主义改造方面，改造私营工商业，更属其中主要的环节。这便赋予中华全国工商业联合会以这样一个任务：要求它在广泛团结各类工商业者的基础上，启发、鼓动私营工商业者的经营积极性，推动、协助他们进行企业改造，并视需要与可能，引导私人资本主义经济逐步走向国家资本主义的轨道。
    过去四年中，私营工商业者在恢复和发展生产、物资交流以及参加抗美援朝运动等方面，都曾有一定的贡献。今后在国家有计划的大规模的经济建设过程中，还需要他们发挥更大的积极性，作更多的贡献。私营工商业者自从在“五反”运动中受到深刻教育后，政治觉悟已有提高，一般的能够减少“五毒”和经营的盲目性、投机性、破坏性，服从人民政府管理，接受国营经济领导和工人群众监督，从事有利国计民生企业的经营。但也不应忽视：“五反”运动以后仍有一部分私营工商业者尚在企图回避国营经济领导和工人群众监督，重蹈盲目竞争故辙，甚至有重犯“五毒”的行为，这是今天国家走向有计划建设的障碍。应当指出：国家人民利益是最高利益，是决不容许破坏和侵犯的。
    面临着中华全国工商业联合会面前的工作：我认为应该是紧密联系群众，开展政治思想教育，宣扬国家的总路线总任务，协助政府解决企业社会主义改造中具体问题，随着企业改造的开展，从而鼓励其经营积极性。其次，在全国范围开展的增产节约竞赛运动中，各地工商联应在私营工商业中间起积极的号召与推动作用，为私营工商业的社会主义改造工作创造有利条件。
