New Atmosphere in Rural Areas After General Election

"General election work is good, production is going great!"

The second district of Lintong County, Shaanxi, after the general election, is indeed unusual. The elected representatives, full of energy, are leading the masses to meet the new task of increasing production and practicing economy. On both sides of the Wei River, north and south of Mount Li, autumn harvesting and autumn planting are proceeding non-stop, intersecting each other. Most of the winter wheat has been sown, all the corn has been stored, the millet has been threshed, and the cotton has begun to be picked. In this busy season, the representatives are also leading the masses to change old farming habits. They changed about 90% of the wheat fields to the famous Bima No. 1 wheat variety (last year it accounted for about 10% to 20%), and the method of sowing in rows with a drill was promoted to more than 80% of the wheat fields (last year it accounted for about 30%). Fertilization, seed dressing with pesticides, and land preparation are all stronger than in previous years. After a recent uniform autumn rain, tender green wheat seedlings have begun to appear on the fertile black soil, swaying gently in the wind. Farmers reflect: This is the benefit brought to us by the general election. The elected representatives and cadres are really effective. General election work is good, production is going great. This is true. Taking Zhuanfang Village in the fourth township as an example, only 20% of the village's wheat fields were planted with Bima No. 1 last year. This year, representative Fang Huating (a poor peasant) transferred his 540 jin of Bima No. 1 to eight households lacking seeds, enabling most of the village's wheat fields to be replanted with new seeds. In the seventh township, there is a representative named Wei Zhijing, who is a labor model and bumper harvest farmer who won an award last year, and also the leader of a mutual aid group. At the township people's congress on September 15, he discussed with everyone how to solve the problem of fertilizer shortage in the township. Later, he took the lead in digging manure pits, promoting the digging of nine in the village, and plans to dig eighteen this year; and persuaded the members of the mutual aid group to basically change the habit of broadcasting wheat seeds to drilling and dense planting. In the midst of autumn harvesting and autumn planting, many mutual aid groups that had collapsed or stalled were reorganized and revitalized under the promotion of the representatives. A good story is circulating in the seventh township: Li Shuxian, a young female representative from Xihe Village, cooperated with the village's production committee member to reorganize three mutual aid groups, breaking the disunity in the group where "no one said anything on the surface, but everyone had their own agenda in their hearts," and established systems such as work points and accounting. Now autumn harvesting and autumn planting are being carried out vigorously. The masses generally praise the new style of the representatives. Currently, the representatives are discussing specific methods with the masses to further promote the campaign to increase production and practice economy.

Two Disputes Resolved Smoothly

Yushui Township in the sixth district of Yingde County, Guangdong Province, is divided into four areas. There is a large fish pond at the junction of the third and fourth areas. During the land reform, this pond was divided into the third area. There are many hillocks like small islands in the fish pond. After the land reform, the farmers in the fourth area successively reclaimed wasteland on these hillocks and planted vegetables and other crops. The farmers in the third area believed that this was an act of infringing on their interests and demanded the unconditional return of these newly reclaimed wastelands. The farmers in the fourth area firmly rejected this request, saying that they had not caught any fish in the pond, but only reclaimed wasteland, which could not be regarded as an act of infringing on their rights. Therefore, when the general election began, the farmers in the third area diverted water into the pond, flooding the newly reclaimed wastelands and crops of the farmers in the fourth area. In this way, a dispute arose between the farmers in the two areas.

The township cadres and the general election work team of Yushui Township realized that in order to do a good job in the general election, they must first resolve this dispute. Therefore, when the township cadres and the work team publicized the significance of the general election, they emphasized the importance of unity and being masters of one's own affairs based on the specific situation, and at the same time went deep into the masses to find out the situation about this dispute. During the population census and voter registration, the work team seized the opportunity to educate the village and township cadres to mobilize the masses to resolve disputes with a selfless attitude. After the township cadres negotiated the dispute between the farmers in the third and fourth areas, it was decided that the wasteland reclaimed in 1952 would belong to the fourth area, and the wasteland reclaimed in 1953 would be returned to the third area. Everyone believed that this treatment was fair and reasonable, and they went back to their villages to explain to the masses. After that, the farmers in the third area took the initiative to hand over the wasteland that should be returned to the fourth area. Many farmers in the fourth area were moved and said: "You can cultivate this crop and then return it to us!"

In addition, there is a mountain forest at the junction of Yushui Township and Tatang Township. This mountain forest originally belonged to a landlord in Yushui Township. Before the land reform, the landlord leased the mountain forest to the eighth village of Tatang Township. The farmers in the eighth village picked firewood and burned lime here. During the land reform, this mountain forest was also distributed to Tatang Township. The farmers in Yushui Township were therefore very dissatisfied, fearing that Tatang Township would continue to infringe on their interests. During the land reform review, at the insistence of the farmers in Yushui Township, the mountain forest was recovered. However, the farmers in Tatang Township still went to the mountain to collect firewood and grass, which again aroused the dissatisfaction of the farmers in Yushui Township. In the general election, Huang Qun (female), the township head of Yushui Township, deeply felt the importance of unity within the people, and explained to the masses: The farmers in the eighth village of Tatang Township rely on this mountain forest for production labor. If they lose it, their lives will encounter difficulties. We must take the initiative to make concessions to them. After her persuasion and education, the people of Yushui Township unanimously agreed to give this mountain forest to Tatang Township.

After this dispute was properly resolved, the relationship between the people of the two townships completely changed.

Shuangyi Village Transformed

Shuangyi Village, Ande Township, Chongning County, Sichuan Province, was originally the most backward village in the township, and many cadres were involved in "small cliques."

During the village-level elections, combined with inspection work, the masses made a serious assessment of all the cadres and elected those who could review their mistakes and improve their work as their representatives. For example, Huang Li, the deputy director of the representative, used to be active and responsible in her work, but she had few methods and her attitude towards the masses was a bit stiff, and she was unwilling to accept other people's opinions. During the general election, she humbly made a review to everyone and was still elected as the deputy director of the representative. Song Yushun, a standing committee member of the township farmers' association, used to think that the village chief and chairman were in charge of the village's affairs, and he could not take the initiative to do work; after reviewing, the masses elected him as the director of the representative.

The general election educated the cadres and made them change their past work style. Song Yushun, the director of the representative, first cared about the production of the masses. This autumn, many farmers believed that "swine fever is destined." He discussed with all the cadres and decided to start with the fifth and ninth groups, which had better conditions, to demonstrate to the masses; then the cadres went to the farmers to publicize and mobilize every household to take action and carry out the "cleaning pigsty" campaign.

Another time, two oxen died in the village, and some cattle farmers sold two because they could not recover the cattle rent. The farmers who lost their cattle had no money to buy them, and those who sold the cattle were unwilling to buy them. At this time, the cadres conducted timely research and realized that the spring harvest had just been reaped and opium was on the market, so the farmers would not be short of money. Therefore, they mobilized the masses to organize to buy cattle. Song Yushun himself took the lead in buying one with four other households. Before the autumn harvest, three new cattle were added to the village, which prepared for the autumn cultivation.

Shuangyi Village, which was always considered backward, has now changed its appearance.

    普选后的农村新气象
    “普选工作好，生产搞美了！”
    普选后的陕西临潼县二区，光景到底不一般。选出的代表们，精神饱满地带领群众迎接着增产节约的新任务。渭水两岸，骊山南北，秋收秋播正一刻不停地交叉进行着，冬麦大部下种了，玉米全部入了仓，谷子已上场，棉花也开始采集。在这个紧张的季节里，代表们还带领群众，改变着旧的耕作习惯。他们把百分之九十左右的麦地改种了有名的碧蚂一号麦种（去年约占百分之十至二十左右），耧种条播方法推广到百分之八十以上的麦地里（去年约占百分之三十左右），施肥、药剂拌种、土地加工等都比往年强。最近一场均匀的秋雨后，嫩绿的麦苗已开始出现在肥黑的土壤上，迎风微摆。农民反映：这是普选给咱带来的好处。选出来的代表和干部真管事。普选工作好，生产搞美了。这话不假，拿四乡砖房村来说，全村麦地去年只有百分之二十种碧蚂一号，今年，代表方化亭（贫农），把自己的五百四十斤碧蚂一号调剂给了八户缺籽户，使得全村大部分麦地换种了新种籽。七乡有个代表叫魏志敬，是去年得奖的劳动模范、丰产户，又是互助联组的组长。在九月十五日的乡人民代表大会上，他和大家讨论如何解决全乡缺乏肥料的问题，以后又带头挖粪坑，推动村子里的人挖了九个，今年计划要挖到十八个；并且说服联组的组员，基本上改变了种麦的撒播习惯，改为耧播密植。在秋收秋播中间，许多垮台、停顿了的互助组，在代表们的推动下，都经过了整顿，从新活跃起来了。七乡流传着一个美谈：西河村的青年女代表李淑贤，协同村里的生产委员整顿了三个互助组，打破了组里“面上不说，心里划圈圈”的不团结状态，建立了计工算账等制度，现在秋收秋播搞得很起劲。群众普遍赞美着代表的新作风。目前，代表们正在和群众研究具体办法，把增产节约运动推进一步。

    两件纠纷顺利地解决了
    广东省英德县第六区鱼水乡共分为四个片，第三片和第四片交界处有一个很大的鱼塘。土地改革时，这口塘分给了第三片。鱼塘里有许多像小岛一样的土丘，第四片的农民在土地改革后，曾先后到这些土丘上开荒，种了青菜等农作物。第三片的农民认为这是侵犯他们的利益的行为，要求无代价地收回这些新开的荒地。第四片的农民坚决拒绝这个要求，说他们没有捉过塘里的鱼，只是开了荒地，这不能算是侵犯他们的权益的行为。于是，第三片的农民在普选开始的时候，引水入塘，把第四片农民新开的荒地和农作物淹没了。这样，两片农民之间就发生了纠纷。
    鱼水乡的乡干部和普选工作队认识到，要做好普选工作，就必须首先解决这个纠纷。于是，乡干部和工作队在宣传普选的意义时，就根据具体情况强调了团结一致当家作主的重要性，同时深入到群众中，摸清关于这个纠纷的情况。在人口调查和选民登记时，工作队便抓紧教育各村乡干部要以大公无私的态度去发动群众解决纠纷。第三片和第四片农民间的纠纷，经过乡干部协商以后，决定：一九五二年开的荒地归第四片，一九五三年开的荒地交还第三片。大家认为这样处理是公平合理的，就分别回到村里向群众进行解释。之后，第三片的农民就主动地把应交还给第四片的荒地交出。第四片许多农民都感动地说：“你们耕完这一造再交还给我们吧！”
    另外，鱼水乡和塌塘乡交界处有一座山林。这座山林原是属于鱼水乡的一个地主的。土地改革前，地主把山林租给塌塘乡第八村。第八村的农民就在这里拾柴草和烧石灰。土地改革时，这座山林也就分给了塌塘乡。鱼水乡的农民因此很不满，怕塌塘乡继续侵犯自己的利益。土地改革复查时，在鱼水乡农民的坚决要求下，收回了这座山林。但此后塌塘乡的农民仍然到山上去打柴割草，因而又引起了鱼水乡农民的不满。普选中，鱼水乡乡长黄群
    （女）深感人民内部团结的重要，便向群众说明：塌塘乡第八村农民依靠这个山林从事生产劳动，要是失去了它，他们的生活就会遇到困难，我们必须主动对他们让步。经过她说服教育以后，鱼水乡人民一致同意把这座山林让给了塌塘乡。
    这件纠纷经妥善解决之后，两乡人民之间的关系就完全改变了。
    双邑村变样了
    四川崇宁县安德乡双邑村原来是全乡最落后的一个村子，有不少干部闹“小圈子”。
    在村基层选举中，结合检查工作，群众对所有干部作了一次认真的鉴别，选举能检讨错误、改进工作的人当自己的代表。如副代表主任黄李氏，以前工作积极负责，就是办法少，对群众的态度有些生硬，不肯接受别人的意见。普选期中，她虚心地向大家作了检讨，仍当选为副代表主任。乡农会常务委员宋玉顺，过去总认为村上的事有村长主席管，不能主动地做工作；经检讨以后，群众把他选为代表主任。
    普选教育了干部，使他们改变了过去的工作作风。代表主任宋玉顺，首先关心到群众的生产。今年秋天，许多农民认为“猪瘟是命中注定的”。他就和全体干部商量，决定先从条件较好的第五、第九两小组做起，给群众示范；然后干部们分头向农民进行宣传，发动每家都行动起来，开展“洗刷猪圈”运动。
    又有一次，村里死了两头耕牛，有的喂牛户由于牛租收不回卖了两头。死了牛的农户没钱买，卖了牛的又不愿买。这时，干部们便及时进行了研究，认识到小春才收割，大烟又上市，农民不会缺钱。于是，他们就动员群众组织起来买耕牛。宋玉顺自己首先和其他四户合买了一头。在秋收以前，全村新添了耕牛三头，给秋耕作好了准备。
    一向被认为落后的双邑村，现在也变了样了。
