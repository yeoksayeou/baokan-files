Increasing Production and Practicing Economy Must Not Be Neglected

    A segment of factories, mines, and basic construction departments focuses zealously on increasing production and completing plans ahead of schedule in the movement to increase production and practice economy, while neglecting the work of practicing economy. Some leading cadres personally involve themselves in formulating production increase plans with great enthusiasm but adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards economy work. Some delegate it to the financial departments for calculation before submitting it; others simply have no economy plan. Consequently, some units are wasting resources while increasing production.
    The reason for this phenomenon is that these comrades do not have a comprehensive understanding of increasing production and practicing economy.
    Some comrades in factories and mines say: "Increasing production and improving quality, that is the biggest economy." Yes, these are important parts of increasing production and practicing economy. However, in addition to this, we must strive to reduce production costs. Therefore, it is necessary to correctly formulate advanced technical and economic quotas; reduce the consumption of raw materials and fuel; rationally improve labor organization, reduce waste of labor and man-hours; improve equipment utilization, and tap the potential capacity of production equipment, etc. Only in this way can we produce better and more goods with the same amount of materials, manpower, and equipment as before. If we do not pay attention to economy, resulting in increased costs, our products, no matter how numerous or good, may not sell because they are too expensive; even if they are sold, our industrial profits may be very low. This will fail to achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy to accumulate funds, and instead, cause enormous waste.
    Some comrades in basic construction departments say: "Ensuring the progress and quality of the project is the biggest economy." Yes, ensuring project quality and progress is the primary task in basic construction. However, as everyone knows, the state's requirements for basic construction are "good, fast, and economical." This means that under the premise of ensuring quality and progress, we should also strive to save the raw materials that should be saved, especially to rationally organize the labor force, promote advanced experience, and reduce construction and installation costs, so as to achieve the goal of being "economical." Doing so does not contradict ensuring quality and progress, but can also play a mutually promoting role. The East China Construction Engineering Company of the Central First Ministry of Machine Building, in carrying out the work of increasing production and practicing economy, tried every means to save the materials that should be saved, actively promoted advanced working methods, and reduced the phenomenon of "idle work" and "waiting for work," totaling more than 5.18 billion yuan in increased production and economy. This approach of the East China Construction Engineering Company is worth emulating by basic construction departments in various regions.
    Some comrades also say: "The most important thing in practicing economy is to solve the waste in production, and the trivial savings in administrative expenses are meaningless." Yes, the economy in factories, mines, and basic construction departments should first focus on solving the waste in production. It is wrong for some of our units to only pay attention to saving management fees without actively overcoming the serious waste in production. However, the savings in administrative expenses and other expenses should still be included in our economy plan. In fact, the amount we can save in this area is not small. The Administrative Office of Anshan Iron and Steel, in increasing production and practicing economy, reasonably tightened the expenditure on office expenses and can save 25 billion yuan in three months. Can this still be called trivial? All departments should reasonably save on administrative and other expenses without affecting work.
    Practicing economy is a regular and important policy in our country's economic construction. All enterprise leaders must put the task of practicing economy on an important agenda; while learning production management, they must learn financial management. Any thought that underestimates this kind of work is wrong. As Stalin said: "The ability to spend financial resources rationally and calculatedly is the most important art." We must learn this art, carefully calculate and handle every yuan of funds entrusted to us by the state, and not allow it to be wasted unnecessarily.

### 增产和节约不能偏废

    增产和节约不能偏废
    一部分厂矿和基本建设部门，在增产节约运动中只热心于增加产量和提前完成计划，而忽视节约的工作。有些领导干部在制订增产计划时亲自动手，劲头很大，但对节约工作则放任自流。有的推给财务部门计算一下就上报；有的则干脆没有节约计划。因而有些单位一边在增产，一边还在浪费。
    产生这种现象的原因，是这些同志对增产节约的认识还不全面。
    有些厂矿同志说：“增加产量，改进质量，这就是最大的节约。”是的，这些都是增产节约的重要部分。但是，除此而外，还必须努力降低生产成本。因此就要正确制订先进的技术经济定额；减少原材料和燃料的消耗；合理地改进劳动组织，减少劳动力和工时的浪费；改善设备的利用，发挥生产设备的潜在能力等等。只有这样，才能以同等数量的物资和人力、设备，生产出较前更好更多的东西。如果我们不注意节约，以致提高成本，我们的产品尽管很多很好，也可能因为太贵了卖不出去；即使卖出去了，我们的工业利润也可能很低。这就达不到增产节约积累资金的目的，反会造成莫大的浪费。
    有些基本建设部门的同志说：“保证工程的进度和质量就是最大的节约。”是的，保证工程质量和进度，是基本建设中的首要任务。但是，大家都知道，国家对于基本建设的要求是“好、快、省”。这就是说：在保证质量和进度的前提下，还应该努力节约应该节约的原材料，特别是要合理地组织劳动力，推广先进经验，降低建筑和安装成本，以便达到“省”的目的。这样做对保证质量和进度并不矛盾，而且还可以起相互推动的作用。中央第一机械工业部华东建筑工程公司在开展增产节约工作中，从各方面设法节省应该节省的材料，积极推广先进工作方法，减少“窝工”“等工”现象，共计可以增产节约五十一亿八千多万元。华东建筑工程公司的这种做法值得各地基本建设部门仿行。
    还有些同志说：“节约最主要的是要解决生产中的浪费，行政费用上鸡毛蒜皮的节约没有意义。”是的，厂矿和基本建设部门的节约，首先应该着眼于解决生产中的浪费现象。我们有些单位只注意节约管理费用，不积极克服生产中存在的严重浪费，这是不对的。但是，行政费用和其他开支的节约也仍然应该列入我们的节约计划中去。事实上我们这方面可以节约的数字也并不小。鞍钢行政处在增产节约中合理地紧缩了办公费的开支，三个月中就可节约二百五十亿元，难道这还能叫做鸡毛蒜皮么？各部门都应该在不影响工作的前提下，合理地节约行政和其他方面的开支。
    节约是我们国家经济建设中一个经常的重要政策。一切企业领导人必须把节约的任务摆在重要的日程上；在学习生产管理的同时，必须学会财务管理。任何轻视这类工作的思想都是不对的。正如斯大林所说的：“善于合理地、有计算地支出财力——这是一件最重要的艺术”，我们必须学会这门艺术，精打细算地来处理国家交给我们的每一元资金，不使它被无谓地浪费掉。
