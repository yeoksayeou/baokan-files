Most parts of Shanxi Province have achieved a bumper harvest of autumn crops.

Under the call to "increase grain yields," farmers throughout Shanxi Province carried out the autumn harvest in a timely manner. Currently, early autumn crops have been harvested, and about 60 percent of the major autumn crops have been harvested. In cotton-producing areas, cotton has generally been picked twice, and in some cases, three times. The growth of autumn crops has generally been good this year. Except for reduced production in some counties in the Changzhi, Yanbei, Yuncheng, and Linfen regions due to natural disasters in the later period, most areas can expect a bumper harvest. The average autumn crop yield for the province as a whole is expected to increase by 7.6 percent compared to last year, with many counties in the Yuci, Xinxian, and Linfen regions expected to increase production by 10 to 20 percent. This year, in addition to actively fighting against natural disasters before the autumn harvest, various localities have also prevented sabotage by bad elements and the encroachment of natural disasters during the harvest. In late September, under the leadership of cadres at all levels, the masses in areas such as Yanbei region and Shouyang and Heshun in Yuci region, and Xiangling and Fushan in Linfen region, effectively fought against frost damage using the smoke fumigation method used in previous years, reducing or preventing frost damage.

In order to ensure timely harvesting and avoid losing a single grain, the mutual aid teams in Lingchuan, Gaoping, Zuoquan, Taigu, Quwo, Datong, Xinxian, and other places actively carried out rectification work from early August to early September and developed autumn harvest plans. Most of the groups and cooperatives that have undergone rectification generally conducted crop ranking during the autumn harvest, determining the order of harvesting, focusing on the crops rather than the people, and harvesting whichever plot ripened first, regardless of which group member owned it. Some groups and cooperatives pre-assessed yields during crop ranking to prevent any crops from being damaged by late harvesting, with the whole group providing appropriate compensation in case of disaster. After the Wei Mancang and Zhang Shangqiao mutual aid teams in Niushe Township, Yishi County, implemented the contract production method, they dispelled the members' concerns about their cotton being rained on and sold for less money, and the two groups have picked the cotton twice in order of ripeness. The groups and cooperatives in Pingshun, Lingchuan, and other places further studied and improved the method of work point assessment and implemented a reasonable division of labor, which improved labor efficiency. After the Biandi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lingchuan implemented equal pay for equal work for men and women, all thirty women in the cooperative participated in the autumn harvest. In order to mobilize women to participate in the harvest, Cui Er Mao and other mutual aid teams in Buluo Township, Xinxian County, organized nurseries during the busy farming season, which resolved internal conflicts, shortened the autumn harvest time, and reduced losses of autumn crops. In addition, due to the proper resolution of the issue of equal pay for equal work for men and women and consideration of the special problems of women, the number of women participating in the autumn harvest this year has greatly increased compared to previous years. Half of the women in Guangling County participated in the autumn harvest and threshing, and 19,267 people in Shuoxian County participated in the autumn harvest, of which female laborers accounted for 26 percent.

This year, the spirit of increasing production and saving grain has been implemented in the autumn harvest in various localities, striving to increase agricultural production by 8 trillion yuan for the province, with an additional two sheng of grain per mu of autumn fields. To ensure the realization of this task, in addition to issuing calls for increased production and conservation, the provincial leadership organized a 114-member inspection team to go deep into key areas to inspect and promote. Six regions including Yanbei and Yuci, four cities, and eleven counties have also successively dispatched 1,225 cadres to go deep into the countryside to provide specific leadership. At present, farmers throughout the province are continuing their efforts to increase yields and are fighting with full confidence to complete the 8 trillion yuan production increase plan.

    山西省大部地区秋作物丰收
    山西省全省农民在“增加粮食收获量”的号召下，适时地进行了秋收，目前早秋作物已经收完，大秋作物已收割百分之六十左右；产棉区棉花普遍摘过两遍，有的已摘过三遍。今年秋作物生长情况一般良好，除长治专区及雁北、运城、临汾专区的部分县因后期遭自然灾害减产外，一般地区可以丰收，全省秋作物平均可比去年增产百分之七点六，榆次、忻县、临汾专区的不少县份可增产一至二成。今年，各地除在秋收前积极对自然灾害进行了斗争外，秋收中又防止了坏分子的破坏和自然灾害的侵袭。雁北专区及榆次专区寿阳、和顺，临汾专区襄陵、浮山等地群众九月下旬即在各级干部领导下，运用历年来使用的薰烟法向霜害进行了有效的斗争，减轻或防止了霜害。为保证按时收割，做到不丢一颗粮。陵川、高平、左权、太谷、曲沃、大同、忻县等地的广大互助组，在八月上旬到九月上旬都积极进行了整顿工作，订出秋收计划。整顿过的大部分组、社，秋收时一般都进行了庄稼排队，确定收割次序，做到看庄稼，不看人，不管那个组员的庄稼，那一块先熟就先割那一块。有的组、社在庄稼站队时，预先评定了产量，防备万一有的庄稼因迟割遭到灾害时，由全组适当赔偿。猗氏牛社乡尉满仓、张上桥两个互助组实行包产办法后，打消了组员怕自己棉花摘到后边遭雨淋，少卖钱的顾虑，两组已按成熟先后，挨次摘过两遍。平顺、陵川等地的组、社进一步研究改进了评工记分、实行合理分工后，提高了劳动效率。陵川遍底农业生产合作社实行男女按活计工后，全社三十个妇女都参加了秋收。忻县部落乡崔二卯等互助组为发动妇女参加收割，组织了农忙托儿所，因而解决了组内矛盾，缩短了秋收时间，减轻了秋禾损失。此外，因适当地解决了男女同工同酬的问题，照顾了妇女的特殊问题，全省今年参加秋收的妇女，比往年大有增加，广灵全县有半数妇女参加了秋收、打场，朔县全县有一万九千二百六十七人参加秋收，其中女劳力占百分之二十六。今年秋收中各地并贯彻了增产节约粮食的精神，争取全省农业增产八千亿元，秋田每亩多打二升粮。为保证这一任务的实现，秋收时，省的领导方面除发出增产节约的号召外，并组织了一百一十四人的检查团，深入重点，检查推动。雁北、榆次等六个专区、四个市、十一个县也先后派出干部一千二百二十五人，深入农村具体领导。目前，全省各地农民正继续努力，争取增加收获量，满怀信心地为完成八千亿元的增产计划而奋斗。    （孙培业）
