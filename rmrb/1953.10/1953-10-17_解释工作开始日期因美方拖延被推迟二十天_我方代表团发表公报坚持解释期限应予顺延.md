Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th—The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean Military Armistice Commission issued the following communiqué on the 15th:

    The explanation work conducted by the Korean-Chinese representatives towards all non-directly repatriated Korean-Chinese prisoners of war began on October 15th. Due to the extremely unreasonable delaying tactics adopted by the US side on the issue of constructing explanation facilities, the start of this explanation work has been postponed by twenty days. However, the US side's conspiracy to indefinitely delay the explanation work has met with a shameful defeat in the face of the resolute struggle of the Korean-Chinese side and the repeated opposition of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

    The ninety-day explanation period stipulated by the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" should have originally started on September 26th. Because the explanation facilities had not been arranged properly at that time, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission decided to postpone and extend it by five days. On September 26th, the Korean-Chinese representatives, at the invitation of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, inspected the explanation camp site built by the US side at that time for the use of the Korean-Chinese representatives. They found that it was located close to the US military-controlled area, and its internal design was completely unsatisfactory. The US side also proposed that the Korean-Chinese side should rebuild the explanation camp site for the US side's use. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, on September 28th, based on the principle that the construction of explanation facilities should respect the requirements of the explaining party, instructed both sides to rebuild the explanation camp sites. The Korean-Chinese side immediately expressed its agreement on the same day, asking the US side to immediately notify the Korean-Chinese side of its specific requirements. At the same time, the Korean-Chinese side immediately notified the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission of the specific requirements of the Korean-Chinese side to be relayed to the US side. However, the US side, using excuses such as uncleared landmines and low-lying terrain in the explanation camp site designated by the Korean-Chinese side, deceived the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and insisted that the Korean-Chinese side unilaterally undertake the obligation to rebuild the explanation camp site according to the US side's requirements. As for the specific requirements of the US side, they were deliberately delayed until the evening of September 29th before being notified to the Korean-Chinese side. The Korean-Chinese side immediately pointed out that the US side had notified the Korean-Chinese side on September 13th that the landmines in the southern part of the demilitarized zone had been cleared, and the area designated by the Korean-Chinese side was not low-lying. The Korean-Chinese side also suggested that due to the urgency of time, both sides could first make temporary arrangements at the location designated by the explaining party, so that the explanation work could begin on October 1st. At the same time, both sides would continue to construct permanent explanation facilities, but the US side refused to do so. Until October 4th, when the Korean-Chinese side had completed the construction of all permanent explanation facilities for the US side's use at the location designated by the US side, according to the US side's design drawings, the US side had not yet indicated whether it was willing to fulfill its construction obligations according to the decision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. On October 5th, after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission sternly demanded that the US side should no longer delay and should immediately begin construction, the US side finally, on October 7th, that is, ten days after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission instructed the US side to fulfill its construction obligations, expressed its willingness to carry out construction, but put forward completely unreasonable construction schedules, namely, erecting twenty temporary explanation tents in seven days and repairing thirty-two explanation tents in four weeks, attempting to postpone the full commencement of the explanation work to November 5th.

    The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission then sent a letter to the US side on October 8th, resolutely demanding that the US side complete the construction of all permanent explanation facilities, including thirty-two explanation tents, before 9:00 AM on October 14th, otherwise the Korean-Chinese side could be responsible for completing the construction within the aforementioned deadline. However, the US side

    refused outright. It only indicated its willingness to reduce the time for erecting twenty temporary tents from seven days to five days. As for when the other permanent facilities could be repaired, it did not make any clear indication, vainly attempting to use twenty temporary explanation tents to perfunctorily deal with the matter and desperately delay the construction of all explanation facilities. As a result, after the explanation work was repeatedly postponed and declared to have begun, the Korean-Chinese side was deprived of more than one-third of its explanation rights for a long time. On the

    other hand, the US side could conduct explanations in all the facilities it requested. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission then reiterated its demand to the US side on October 10th to complete the construction of all explanation facilities by October 14th. In order to eliminate all excuses for the US side's delay, the Korean-Chinese side further stated on October 11th that if the US side could slightly expand the twenty temporary explanation tents that it claimed could be erected on the same day and erect thirty-two temporary explanation tents before 9:00 AM on October 14th, the Korean-Chinese side was willing to make concessions and conduct all explanation work in the temporary explanation facilities from October 14th. Seeing that it could no longer play the trick of first repairing a small number of temporary explanation tents and delaying the construction of all explanation facilities for a long time, the US side declared on October 12th that it had decided not to erect temporary explanation tents, and what it had already repaired were not twenty temporary explanation tents, but sixteen permanent explanation tents, and another sixteen permanent explanation tents would have to be delayed until October 21st to be repaired.

    Only after the Korean-Chinese side once again thoroughly exposed the US side's conspiracy to delay the full commencement of the explanation work, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission had for the third time demanded that the US side repair all permanent explanation facilities by 9:00 AM on October 14th, did the US side be forced to withdraw the unreasonable construction schedule it had repeatedly put forward and accept the demands of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on October 12th.

    It must be pointed out that while delaying the start of the explanation work, the US side is also attempting to overturn the decisions made by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on September 24th and October 3rd regarding the extension of the explanation period, vainly attempting to shorten the ninety-day explanation period stipulated by the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and deprive the explanation representatives of the right to conduct explanations and the prisoners of war of the right to listen to explanations. The Korean-Chinese side firmly believes that the US side bears full responsibility for delaying the explanation work. The postponement of the full explanation work start date caused by the US side's repeated delays should be extended in accordance with the existing decisions of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

### 解释工作开始日期因美方拖延被推迟二十天  我方代表团发表公报坚持解释期限应予顺延

    解释工作开始日期因美方拖延被推迟二十天
    我方代表团发表公报坚持解释期限应予顺延
    【新华社开城十五日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中代表团十五日发表公报如下：
    朝中代表向一切不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员所进行的解释工作，已于十月十五日开始。由于美方在修建解释设备的问题上采取了极其无理的拖延态度，此项解释工作的开始被推迟了二十天。但美方无限期拖延解释工作的阴谋，在朝中方面坚决斗争与中立国遣返委员会一再反对之下，已遭遇到可耻的失败。
    “中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”所规定的九十天解释期限，原应于九月二十六日开始，由于当时解释设备尚未安排妥当，经中立国遣返委员会决定，推迟并顺延五天。九月二十六日，朝中代表应中立国遣返委员会之邀，至美方当时所修建的供朝中代表使用的解释营场视察，发现它紧靠于美方军事控制地区，其内部设计亦完全不能令人满意。而美方也提出了朝中方面应重建供美方使用的解释营场的要求。中立国遣返委员会乃于九月二十八日，根据解释设备的修建应尊重解释一方要求的原则，责成双方重建解释营场。朝中方面当天即对此表示同意，要美方将其具体要求立即通知朝中方面，一面并将朝中方面的具体要求，在当日立即通知中立国遣返委员会转告美方。但美方则以朝中方面所指定的解释营场地点地雷未清除、地势低洼等藉口，欺骗中立国遣返委员会，硬要朝中方面片面承担按美方要求重建解释营场的义务。至于美方要求的具体意见，则又故意迟至九月二十九日晚，才通知朝中方面。朝中方面当即指出，美方在九月十三日曾通知朝中方面称，非军事区南部的地雷已经清除，而朝中方面所指定的地区更非低洼。朝中方面并建议：由于时间紧迫，可由双方先在解释一方所指定的地点进行临时安排，使解释工作在十月一日得以开始。与此同时，双方再继续进行永久性的解释设备的修建，但美方对此加以拒绝。直至十月四日，朝中方面在美方所指定的地点，根据美方的设计图样，修好供美方使用的一切永久性解释设备时，美方尚未表示它是否愿根据中立国遣返委员会的决定，履行其修建义务。到十月五日，中立国遣返委员会严词要求美方不得再行拖延，而应立即开始修建工作后，美方才在十月七日，也即中立国遣返委员会责成美方履行其修建义务以后十天，表示愿进行修建，但又提出完全不合理的修建时间，即七天搭好二十个临时解释帐篷，四星期修好三十二个解释帐篷，企图把解释工作的全面开始，推迟至十一月五日。
    中立国遣返委员会乃于十月八日致函美方，坚决要求美方在十月十四日上午九时前，修好包括三十二个解释帐篷的一切永久性解释设备，否则可由朝中方面负责在上述期限内完成此项修建。但美方
    一概予以拒绝，它仅表示愿将搭二十个临时帐篷的时间，自七天减至五天，至于其他永久性设备何时可修好，则不做任何明确表示，妄想先用二十个临时解释帐篷来敷衍塞责，而极力拖延全部解释设备的修建，使解释工作经一再推迟而宣告开始后，朝中方面又被长期剥夺三分之一以上的解释权利。另
    一方面，美方却可在它所要求的全部设备内进行解释。中立国遣返委员会乃于十月十日，向美方重申在十月十四日完成全部解释设备的修建的要求。而朝中方面为解除美方一切拖延藉口，更于十月十一日表示如美方能将他声称可于当天搭好的二十个临时解释帐篷稍加扩充，在十月十四日上午九时前搭好三十二个临时解释帐篷，则朝中方面愿意让步，自十月十四日起在临时解释设备内进行全部解释工作。美方眼看它已不能再要先修少数临时解释帐篷而长期拖延全部解释设备之修建的花样，乃于十月十二日宣称，它已决定不搭临时解释帐篷，它所已修好的也不是二十个临时解释帐篷，而是十六个永久性解释帐篷，另十六个永久性解释帐篷，则须迟至十月二十一日方能修好。
    只是在朝中方面再一次彻底揭露美方拖延解释工作全面开始的阴谋，而中立国遣返委员会又向美方第三度提出应于十月十四日上午九时修好一切永久性解释设备之要求后，美方才被迫撤回了它一再提出的无理修建日程，于十月十二日接受了中立国遣返委员会的要求。
    必须指出：美方一方面在拖延解释工作的开始，另一方面又企图推翻中立国遣返委员会在九月二十四日与十月三日关于解释期限应予顺延的决定，妄图缩短“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”所规定的九十天解释期限，剥夺解释代表进行解释与战俘听取解释的权利。朝中方面坚决认为：美方负有拖延解释工作的完全责任，由于美方一再拖延而产生的全面解释工作开始日期的推迟，应根据中立国遣返委员会的已有决定，予以顺延。
