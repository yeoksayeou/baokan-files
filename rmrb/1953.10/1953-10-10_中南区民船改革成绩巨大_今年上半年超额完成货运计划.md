    Great achievements have been made in the reform of civilian shipping in the Central-South region, promoting the development of inland waterway transportation. In the first half of this year, the volume of civilian ship freight completed 127.6% of the plan, an increase of 68% over the same period last year, and the ton-kilometers completed 117.8% of the plan, an increase of 48% over the same period last year.
    The Central-South region has more than 270 main and tributary rivers, with a total length of more than 41,000 kilometers. More than 10,000 kilometers are navigable by ships, and more than 30,000 kilometers are navigable by civilian vessels, forming a vast waterway transportation network. There are more than one million people engaged in water transport, with 168,000 wooden sailing ships alone, with a carrying capacity of 1,607,000 tons, accounting for 60% of the region's transportation tasks last year. However, before the reform of civilian shipping, shipowners lacked confidence in their operations, and about 30% of the ships were in disrepair. The remnants of feudal reactionary forces continued to rule the people on the water in areas with weak shipping management, and some even infiltrated trade union organizations to carry out illegal activities. Enemies who escaped from land also fled to the water, further complicating the situation on the water. At the same time, due to lack of experience, many systems for the management of civilian ships were unreasonable, and transportation was unorganized and unplanned, often resulting in long-term delays in loading and unloading.
    Since February of this year, provinces and cities in the Central-South region have successively sent more than 11,200 cadres to 639 ports to lead shipworkers and shipowners in launching a civilian ship reform movement. Through grievance sessions and networking, more than 900,000 shipworkers and shipowners participated in the movement. In the past six months, the feudal reactionary forces on the water have been crushed, and the masses have celebrated their liberation, from which more than 28,900 activists have emerged.
    In the process of civilian ship reform, the working cadres also clarified the characteristics of civilian ship work: individual operations and the unevenness of inland waterway transportation, the great seasonality and dispersion, corrected the past tendency to manage civilian ships as modern enterprises, and improved the working system. In terms of reducing the burden on shipowners, Hunan Province reduced the original 31 types of fees to 11, and Hubei Province reduced from 27 to 7. In terms of simplifying import and export procedures, major ports have implemented collective office work, merged unnecessary procedures, and organized mobile collective office groups in ports with excessively dispersed berthing areas to provide various conveniences to shipowners. Hubei Province has adopted methods such as the joint transportation agency collecting freight on behalf of shipowners, paying taxes on their behalf, and representatives of ship teams and ship groups handling procedures together. In the past, it took 31 procedures, went through eight agencies, and made 30 or more round trips to complete procedures in Nanchang Port, which took up to four or five days. After the merger, it only took two or three hours to complete. In addition, Hunan Province also abolished the unreasonable "inspection and measurement system," Henan Province abolished the navigation fee visa system and the midway inspection system, and Guangdong Province corrected the tendency of organizing shipowners to "eat from the big pot." Shipowners generally reflected: "The people's government has found the root cause of our shipping problems," and "The people's government is really thinking about us in every way." The enthusiasm of shipworkers and shipowners who have undergone civilian ship reform has generally increased. On the one hand, they urgently demand to be organized, and on the other hand, they actively work to improve transportation. Trade unions have been rectified in various ports, and shipowners associations have been established. The masses who have been organized account for 60% to 70% of the number that should be organized. They actively respond to the call of the state and strongly support the grain transportation task. For example, 17,000 tons of civilian ships in Hunan entered the Yuan River, transporting many "dead corner grain" from the Xiangxi mountainous area, and completed the province's emergency grain transfer of 120,000 tons on schedule. Civilian ships on the Huai River in Henan transported 32 million catties of grain for the Huai River project 21 days ahead of schedule, and promptly supplied food for 300,000 migrant workers, which was praised by the Xinyang headquarters. Many shipowners have also signed patriotic pacts, determined to unite and help each other, improve transportation, and put forward slogans such as "four guarantees" (guarantee quality, guarantee quantity, guarantee time, guarantee safety) and "three quicks" (quick loading, quick unloading, quick transportation), which improved transportation efficiency. In Guangdong Province, the journey from Laolong to Huizhou on the Dongjiang River used to take 45 days, but after the civilian ship reform, it was reduced to 20 days. The volume of freight has also increased due to improved efficiency. In the first half of this year, the freight volume of civilian ships in Nanchang Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, increased four and a half times compared with the same period last year. The freight volume in Wuzhou, Guangxi Province, increased by 49% in March, April, and May compared with the spring of last year, and increased by 23% compared with the summer of last year. The freight volume in the entire region has increased significantly. Due to the active inland waterway transportation, many shipowners are actively repairing ships and adding tools, and the income of shipworkers has also increased.
    The Central-South Inland Waterway Navigation Administration is vigorously strengthening the policy education of navigation cadres, strengthening contact with shipowners, and further organizing and utilizing this huge transportation force to adapt to the increasingly heavy inland waterway transportation tasks.

    中南区民船改革成绩巨大
    今年上半年超额完成货运计划
    中南区的民船改革成绩巨大，促进了内河航运事业的发展。今年上半年民船货运量完成计划百分之一百二十七点六，比去年同期增加百分之六十八，吨公里完成计划百分之一百十七点八，比去年同期增加百分之四十八。
    中南区共有干支河流二百七十多条，全长四万一千多公里，有一万多公里能通行轮船，三万多公里能通行民船，构成了广阔的水路运输网。水上运输从业人员有一百多万人，仅木帆船就有十六万八千多只，载重量达一百六十万七千吨，去年担负了全区运输任务百分之六十。但在民船改革以前，船民经营信心不高，约有百分之三十的船只失修。封建反动残余势力仍在航运管理薄弱地区继续统治水上人民，有的还钻入工会组织进行非法活动。从陆上漏网的敌人也潜逃水上，更使水上情况复杂。同时，由于缺乏经验，对民船管理上也有许多制度不合理，运输无组织无计划，常有长期停航待装待卸的现象发生。
    从今年二月起中南区各省市先后派了一万一千二百多干部，到六百三十九个港口，领导船工船民展开民船改革运动。经过诉苦串连，发动船工船民九十多万人参加了运动，半年以来，已经摧毁了水上的封建反动势力，群众欢庆翻身，并从中涌现出积极分子两万八千九百多名。
    在民船改革过程中，工作干部也摸清了民船工作的特点：个体经营和内河运输吞吐不平衡、季节性和分散性很大，纠正了过去将民船当现代化企业管理的偏向，改进了工作制度。在减轻船民负担方面湖南省从原来三十一种费目减至十一种，湖北省由二十七种减少为七种。在简化进出口手续方面，各大港口都实行集体办公，合并了不必要的手续，停泊区过于分散的港口还组织了流动的集体办公小组，给船民办理手续时以各种方便。湖北省采取了由联运社代船民收运费，代付税款，以及由船队船组的代表一起办理手续等办法。南昌港过去要办手续三十一道，经过八个机关，往返三十多次，最多得花四、五天时间，合并后只需两三小时便能办完。另外，湖南省还废除了不合理的“检丈制度”，河南省取消了航行费签证制度与中途检查制度，广东省纠正了组织船民“吃大锅饭”的偏向。船民普遍反映：“走船的这条病根子，也叫人民政府找着了”，“人民政府真是处处为我们打算”。经过民船改革的船工船民积极性普遍高涨，一方面迫切要求组织起来，一方面积极搞好运输。各个港口都先后整顿了工会，建立了船民协会，组织起来的群众占应组织人数百分之六十至七十。他们积极响应国家号召，大力支持运粮任务。如湖南有一万七千吨民船进入沅水，运出湘西山区许多“死角粮”，按期完成全省紧急调粮十二万吨的任务。河南淮河民船提前二十一天运送了三千二百万斤治淮工粮，及时供应了三十万民工的食用，受到信阳指挥部的表扬。许多船民还订了爱国公约，决心团结互助，搞好运输，并且提出“四保”（保质、保量、保时、保安全）三快（快装、快卸、快运）等口号，提高了运输效率。广东省东江从老隆到惠州的民船去年航行一次需四十五天，民船改革后减至二十天。货运量也因效率提高而增加。江西南昌专区民船今年上半年的货运量比去年同时增加了四倍半，广西梧州三、四、五月的货运量比去年春季增加百分之四十九，比去年夏季增加百分之二十三。全区的货运都有显著增加。由于内河运输的活跃，许多船民都积极修补船只，增添工具，船工的收入也有增加。
    中南内河航运管理局正大力加强航运干部的政策教育，加强和船民的联系，进一步组织和运用这一支巨大的运输力量，以适应日益繁重的内河航运任务。（中南民船工作委员会林琦）
