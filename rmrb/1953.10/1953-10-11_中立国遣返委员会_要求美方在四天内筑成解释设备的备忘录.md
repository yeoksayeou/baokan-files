Xinhua News Agency: The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission sent a memorandum to the United Nations Command on the 8th, requesting the U.S. side to construct explanation facilities within four days. The full text of the memorandum is as follows:

    Your letter of October 7, 1953, has been received. The letter was circulated to the Commission last night and was brought up for discussion at the Commission meeting this morning. The Commission has reached the following conclusions and decisions:

    (1) The Commission believes that the time estimated by you in your letter of October 3, 1953, and reaffirmed by you in your letter of yesterday, for the construction of the explanation facilities is too long. This conclusion is based on: (a) the inspection of the site in question; (b) the assessment of the existing technical and manpower resources of the United Nations Command; (c) the fact that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has expressed its willingness to provide you with some manpower; and finally (d) the repeated assurances from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Command that they are prepared to commence construction and complete all permanent structures within four days.

    (2) The time estimated by you will mean a delay in the commencement of the entire explanation work, and it will also mean a reduction of approximately forty-one days in the explanation period. The Commission is not prepared to be held responsible for the shortening of the explanation period, especially because the United Nations Command cannot agree to extend the date of the end of the explanation work.

    (3) In view of the above considerations and in view of the Commission's responsibility to provide the explanation representatives with freedom and facilities, the Commission hereby requests you: (a) to build the permanent facilities within four days; (b) or to allow the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Command to act in accordance with their proposals.

    (4) The Commission also considered the objections raised in your letter of October 7 against the construction of a road parallel to the military armistice line to the west of the Indian Custodial Forces area. You also drew my attention to a letter from General O'Brien, in which General O'Brien expressed opposition to the construction of a convenient road across the military armistice line south of Dongchang-ri.

    (5) The Commission is fully aware of the argument that the United Nations Command has the right to designate an area within which it will hand over prisoners of war. However, the Commission is unable to find any provision in its terms of reference that prohibits the United Nations Command from adjusting this area. Therefore, the Commission confidently hopes that the United Nations Command is prepared to make the necessary adjustments to enable the Commission to fulfill its most important responsibility regarding the explanation work.

    (6) The reason why the Commission insists on building another road to the west of the custodial forces area is that without such a road, the Indian Custodial Forces cannot effectively perform the task it has accepted, namely, to ensure the safety of the explanation personnel, translators, journalists, and Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission personnel within and around the explanation area. It must also ensure that prisoners of war do not cause any disturbances. Since the road you have already provided is too close to the prisoner-of-war camp, the Indian Custodial Forces will not be able to fulfill all of the above tasks. I believe that the United Nations Command certainly does not want to increase the difficulties of the Indian Custodial Forces and will accept the Commission's request to build another road to the west of the Indian Custodial Forces area for the use of the Indian Custodial Forces.

    (7) Regarding the matter of General O'Brien's letter objecting to the construction of a road south of Dongchang-ri, the Commission has written separately to General O'Brien. However, you may be pleased to know that the Commission believes that this road is also indispensable in order for the Indian Custodial Forces to fulfill its duties.

    (8) I would be very grateful if you would let me know whether the United Nations Command is prepared and willing to build those necessary buildings by 9:00 a.m. on October 14, or allow the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Command to complete this work in accordance with their proposals.

    (9) Since the construction of the explanation facilities has been delayed for too long for many reasons, the Commission very much hopes to receive your reply before 10:00 a.m. on October 9, 1953.

### 中立国遣返委员会  要求美方在四天内筑成解释设备的备忘录

    中立国遣返委员会
    要求美方在四天内筑成解释设备的备忘录
    【新华社讯】    中立国遣返委员会在八日送交联合国军司令部备忘录一份，要求美方在四天内筑成解释设备。备忘录全文如下：
    你方一九五三年十月七日的来信已收到。该信于昨晚交本委员会传阅，并已在今晨的委员会会议上提出讨论。本委员会达成以下的结论和决定：
    （一）本委员会认为，你方一九五三年十月三日来信中所估计的，以及你方在昨天来信中又再度申明的建筑解释设备所需的时间太长。这个结论所根据的是：（甲）对所说的场址进行的勘察；（乙）对联军司令部现有的技术和人力两方面力量的估计；（丙）中立国遣返委员会已表示向你提供一些人力的事实；最后（丁）朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部一再提出的保证：他们准备在四天内着手修建并完成全部永久性的建筑。
    （二）你方所估计的时间将意味着全部解释工作要延期开始，它也将意味着解释时间要缩短约四十一天，委员会不准备对解释时期的缩短负有责任，特别是因为联军司令部不能同意延长解释工作结束的日期。
    （三）鉴于以上的考虑以及鉴于本委员会有责任给予解释代表以自由和设备，本委员会现要求你方：（甲）在四天之内修建好永久性设备。（乙）或允许朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部按照它们的建议行事。
    （四）本委员会并考虑了你方十月七日来信中提出的反对在印度看管部队地区西面修建和军事停战线平行的一条道路的意见。你方并要求我注意勃里安将军的一封信，勃里安将军在那封信中表示反对在东场里以南修建一条跨过军事停战线的便路。
    （五）本委员会十分清楚地知道这样一个论点：联军司令部有权指定一个地区，由它在这个地区内移交战俘。但是本委员会并不能够从职权范围中找出禁止联军司令部调整这个地区的任何条款。因此，本委员会满怀信心地希望：联军司令部准备进行必要的调整，以使本委员会得以履行它所负的关于解释工作的最重要的责任。
    （六）本委员会之所以坚持要另筑一座通往看管部队地区西部的通道是因为如果没有这样一条通道，印度看管部队就不能有效地执行它所接受的任务，即确保在解释区以内和周围的解释人员、翻译员、记者和中立国遣返委员会人员的安全。它并且还要确保战俘们不能制造任何骚乱。由于你方所已经提供的通道靠战俘营太近，印度看管部队将不能履行上述的全部任务。我相信，联军司令部一定不希望增加印度看管部队的困难，而会接受本委员会所提出的要求，另筑一条通往印度看管部队地区西部的通道供印度看管部队使用。
    （七）关于勃里安将军信中所说的反对在东场里以南修筑通道的事，本委员会已另函勃里安将军，但是，你方可能乐于知道，本委员会认为，为了使印度看管部队履行它的职责，这条通道同样是不可少的。
    （八）如果蒙你方让我知道联军司令部是否准备和愿意在十月十四日上午九时以前造好那些必须的建筑，或允许朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部按照它们的提议来完成这项工作，我将非常感激。
    （九）由于解释设备的建筑工作已经因为许多原因而延迟过久，本委员会非常希望能在一九五三年十月九日上午十时以前得到你方的答复。
