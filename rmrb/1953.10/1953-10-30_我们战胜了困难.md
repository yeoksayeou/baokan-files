    We Overcame Difficulties
    Liu Tienan, Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Works Rolling Mill Engineering Company, Director of Seamless Steel Tube Plant Construction Site

    Our country's first automated seamless steel tube plant has been completed. A little over a year ago, we encountered many difficulties. However, thanks to the wise leadership of the Party, the strong support of the people nationwide, the sincere assistance of Soviet experts, and the efforts of all the workers, we finally victoriously completed this glorious and great task.

    When constructing the seamless steel tube plant, the first difficulty we encountered was that we had never built such a technically complex and large-scale factory before. How to prepare? What to prepare? Who would prepare, etc.? We were completely ignorant. However, with the arrival of Soviet expert Comrade Vichitov, we learned that before formal construction, we had to draw up a general layout plan for the construction project, determine the construction sequence, organize forces, and establish subsidiary factories, etc. The next difficulty was a series of technical problems to be solved, such as lowering the groundwater level from 1.5 meters to below 9 meters, and knocking out many old column base foundations and re-pouring new ones. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, after two months of painstaking experimentation, these difficulties were solved one after another, creating favorable conditions for formal construction.

    After formal construction began on July 14th last year, we encountered even more numerous and unpredictable difficulties. But because we, under the leadership of the Party, mobilized and relied on all the workers, and conscientiously studied the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we finally overcame a series of difficulties, ensured the quality of the project, and shortened the construction period.

    At that time, the biggest difficulty was the massive amount of work and technical complexity, while our technical strength was weak, the organization was incomplete, and people lacked confidence. According to the national plan, within half a year, we had to complete 100,000 cubic meters of earthwork, over 35,000 cubic meters of reinforced concrete foundation work, over 50,000 meters of various pipelines, over 6,000 tons of mechanical and electrical equipment, over 2,500 tons of steel structures, over 1,700 tons of furnace construction, and 600,000 cubic meters of drainage. In total, various materials amounted to approximately 300,000 tons, which would require at least 200 trains (45 cars per train) to transport. The entire installation technology had to meet the most advanced technical standards of the Soviet Union. These standards required that the measurement baseline of the entire plant should not exceed one millimeter, and the precision of mechanical installation should only allow for within two "dao" (one millimeter is one hundred "dao"). The error of the entire foundation engineering's formwork, rebar, fixed frames, anchor bolts, pipelines, etc., generally could not exceed five or ten millimeters.

    However, what about ourselves? Because of a lack of construction experience, we were in a state of extreme chaos in terms of construction organization, construction management, and the thinking of the workers. For example, at that time, there were nine units working on the construction site, including more than fifty types of work. Every day, six or seven thousand workers were working from the sky, the ground, and down to nine meters underground. As a result, there were many cases of insufficient cooperation or lack of coordination.

    Obviously, whether we could be victorious, whether we could quickly build the seamless steel tube plant according to the most advanced technical standards of the Soviet Union, and whether we could withstand this test, became the most prominent and main problem at that time. Under this circumstance, we first, based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and under the instructions of our superiors, implemented the system of the construction site director being responsible, unified the leadership of the construction site, focused on grasping the progress and quality of the project, and ensured the comprehensive completion of the task. We also organized and supervised various departments to construct according to the project schedule and work sequence balance based on the contract relationships established by each engineering company. This overcame the chaotic phenomenon of each acting on their own and created favorable conditions for the implementation of unified and rhythmic construction.

    At the same time, among the workers, through the establishment of the responsibility system movement, studying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and conducting education on national industrialization and the socialist perspective, we unified the understanding of the workers, launched a red flag competition, and set off a high tide of construction. In the three months of July, August, and September last year alone, all the workers created more than 20 kinds of advanced experiences, the most famous of which were Zhou Xiangchen's blasting method, Wang Jinzhong team's concrete pouring, Zhang Jiaming group's anchor bolt installation, Qu Xingpei and Lv Baofang group's cable pipeline installation, as well as advanced experiences in foundation engineering's formwork, rebar installation, and roofing asbestos tile laying. These methods increased labor efficiency by as much as 250% and at least 28%. Twenty model teams, forty-two model groups, three hundred and ninety-seven model workers, eighteen special-class labor models, and one thousand six hundred and twenty-seven activists also emerged. Because we enthusiastically carried out the competition, we ensured the timely or early completion of monthly plans and successfully completed the annual plan.

    Now, the seamless steel tube plant is about to start production. After inspection and acceptance and expert appraisal, its quality is good and fully meets Soviet standards. At the same time, through the construction of this factory, we have cultivated a strong technical force for our country's future construction. For example, in terms of technical strength, we started with only one engineer and more than forty new graduates. Now, the technical strength has increased threefold. More than ten technicians have been promoted to engineers or technicians, more than thirty apprentice technicians have been promoted to formal technicians, and more than ninety foremen have been cultivated from ordinary workers or technicians. Initially, there were only forty-nine cement workers, but now that has increased twelvefold. The number of others, such as welders, plumbers, rock drillers, waterproofers, carpenters, and tilers, have also increased by two or three times. The overall strength has increased by more than half.

    As the seamless steel tube plant is about to be officially put into production, looking at the present and thinking about the past, we cannot help but feel excited about the achievements of our great motherland's industrial construction. We cannot but thank the Soviet Union for its help. Our great leader Chairman Mao said in his telegram to Comrade Malenkov on September 15th: "Because the great Soviet government has agreed to provide systematic economic and technical assistance in the construction and reconstruction of China's ninety-one new enterprises and the fifty enterprises under construction and reconstruction, the Chinese people will be able to gradually establish their own powerful heavy industry by learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and the latest technological achievements. This is of great significance for China's industrialization, China's gradual transition to socialism, and the strengthening of the forces of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union." We have deeply realized this point. Now we are actively preparing our forces and striving forward to build more industrial bases.

    我们战胜了困难
    鞍钢轧钢工程公司经理无缝钢管厂工地主任  刘铁男
    我国的第一座自动化无缝钢管厂建成了。一年多以前，我们曾经遇到许许多多的困难。但由于党的英明领导，全国人民的大力支援，苏联专家的真诚帮助，以及全体职工的努力，终于胜利地完成了这一光荣、伟大的任务。
    在建设无缝钢管厂时，我们首先遇到的困难，就是我们从来没有建设过这样技术复杂、规模巨大的工厂，如何进行准备？准备些什么？谁去准备等等都茫然无知，但由于苏联专家维奇托莫夫同志的到来，我们才知道了在正式施工以前，必须绘制建筑工程总平面图，确定工程进行程序，组织力量，建立附属工厂等等。接着而来的困难，就是一系列的技术问题要解决，如把地下水要从一公尺五降低到九公尺以下，再如许多旧柱脚基础要打掉，重新浇灌新的柱脚基础等等。在苏联专家的指导下，经过两个月的苦心试验，这些困难也就一个接着一个地解决了。从而就为正式施工创造了有利的条件。
    在去年七月十四日正式施工以后，我们更遇到了许许多多难以估计的困难，但也因为我们在党的领导下，发动和依靠全体职工，认真地学习苏联的先进经验，终于战胜了一系列的困难，保证了工程质量，缩短了工期。
    当时最大的困难，就是工程量浩大，技术复杂，而我们的技术力量薄弱，组织不健全，人们的信心不大。如按照国家的计划，在半年内即要完成土方十万立方公尺，钢筋混凝土基础工程三万五千余立方公尺，各种管道五万余公尺，机电设备六千多吨，钢架结构二千五百余吨，筑炉一千七百余吨，排水六十万立方公尺。总计各种材料约计三十万吨，如全部用火车载运，至少需要二百列车（每列四十五节）。在整个安装技术上，必须达到苏联最先进的技术标准。这种标准，要求全厂测量基线不超过一个公厘，机械安装精密程度，只允许在二道以内（一公厘为一百道），整个基础工程的模板、钢筋、固定架、地脚螺丝、管道等的误差，一般也不能超过五个或十个公厘。
    可是，我们自己呢？因为没有施工经验，当时无论在施工组织上、施工管理上与职工思想上，都处于极混乱的状态。如当时在工地上施工的组织，共有九个单位，包括五十余种工种，每日作业工人达六、七千人，从天空、地面，直到深达九公尺的地下，到处都是人。因而互相配合不够，或衔接不上的事情很多。
    很显然，我们能不能胜利，能不能照着苏联最先进的技术标准，把无缝钢管厂迅速地建设起来，我们能不能经得住这一个考验，就成为当时最突出和最主要的问题。在这种情形下，我们首先就根据苏联的先进经验，在上级的指示下，实行了工地主任负责制，统一领导工地施工，着重掌握工程进度、工程质量，保证全面地完成任务，并根据各工程公司所订的合同关系，组织与督促各部门按工程进度与工序平衡施工。从而就克服了各自为政的混乱现象，并为实行统一的、有节奏的施工创造了有利的条件。
    同时，在职工中，通过建立责任制运动，学习苏联先进经验，以及进行国家工业化和社会主义远景的教育，统一了职工的认识，展开了红旗竞赛，掀起了施工的高潮。仅去年七、八、九三个月中，全体职工就先后创造了先进经验二十余种，其中最著名的有周相臣的爆破法，王进忠队的混凝土浇灌，张甲明小组的地脚螺丝安装，曲兴沛、吕宝芳小组的电缆管道安装，以及基础工程的模板、钢筋安装，与房顶石绵瓦的铺设先进经验。这些方法提高劳动效率最高达百分之二百五十，最低亦达百分之二十八。并且还涌现了模范班二十个，模范组四十二个，模范三百九十七人，特等劳动模范十八人，积极分子一千六百二十七人。由于我们热烈地开展了竞赛，因而也就保证了月度计划的按时或提前完成，胜利地完成了年度计划。
    现在，无缝钢管厂就要开始生产了。经过检查验收和专家的鉴定，它的质量是良好的，完全达到了苏联的标准。同时，经过这一工厂的建设，更为我们培养了一支强大的技术力量，为我国今后建设打下了基础。譬如技术力量，开始只有一个工程师和四十余名新从学校毕业的学生，现在技术力量已经增长了三倍，十余名技术人员，已被提升为工程师或技师，三十余名见习技术员被提升为正式技术员，九十余名工长是从普通工或技工中培养起来的。开始时，水泥工人只有四十九名，现在已增加了十二倍，其他如电焊、水道、凿岩、防水、木工、瓦工等，有的增加两倍或三倍。总的力量已增长到一倍半以上。
    当着无缝钢管厂就要正式投入生产的时候，看看现在，想想过去，我们不能不为我们伟大祖国的工业建设的成就而感到振奋，我们不能不感谢苏联的帮助，我们伟大的领袖毛主席九月十五日给马林科夫同志的电文中说道：“由于伟大的苏联政府同意在建设和改建中国的九十一个新的企业以及正在建设和改建中的五十个企业中给以系统的经济和技术的援助，中国人民将能够在学习苏联的先进经验和最新技术成就的努力之下，逐步地建立起自己强大的重工业，这对于中国工业化、使中国逐步过渡到社会主义和壮大以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，都具有极其重大的作用。”我们更深深地体会了这点，现在我们正积极地准备力量，为建设更多的工业基地而奋勇前进。
