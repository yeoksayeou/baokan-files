    Ethnic Trade Store in Leishan County, Guizhou Province
    Supplies Materials According to the Needs of the Miao People
    The ethnic trade store in Leishan County, Guizhou Province, supplies a large quantity of agricultural tools and daily necessities according to the needs of ethnic minorities, and purchases local and special products, which is welcomed by ethnic minorities.
    Leishan County is located in a remote mountainous area in southeastern Guizhou Province, and more than 90% of the county's residents are Miao people. This spring, under the leadership of the local People's Government, the ethnic trade store in Leishan County organized a team to conduct in-depth research in the mountainous areas. According to the lack of agricultural tools among Miao farmers, it was decided to supply agricultural tools as the main business. From February, the organization of local processing was done according to the quantity of agricultural tools needed in various places. In order to make the agricultural tools meet the needs of the masses, experienced old farmers were invited to participate in the guidance during processing. From January to September this year, a total of more than 6,900 pieces of agricultural tools such as plows, harrows, and sickles were supplied. In terms of operating general merchandise and daily necessities, the sources of goods were also organized according to the needs of the Miao people. The ethnic trade store went to Guiyang, Zhenyuan, Duyun and other places to purchase flower threads, bed sheets, and shirting cloth that the Miao people liked, and prepared sufficient iron pots, cotton wadding, cotton quilts, cotton clothes and other items.
    The Leishan County area is vast and there are few market towns. In order to facilitate the purchase of goods by the Miao people, in addition to organizing private merchants to go to the countryside, the trade store also used "peddlers" to carry goods to remote rural areas. Before the autumn harvest, the store's peddlers crossed the main peak of the Miaoling Mountains, Leigong Mountain, to Fangxiang Township, 90 miles away from the city, and supplied daily necessities worth more than 3 million yuan.
    When collecting local and special products, because Miao farmers are not familiar with the types and specifications of the products, the ethnic trade store planted Ophiopogon japonicus, Pinellia ternata, Asparagus cochinchinensis and other local products in flower pots, and used these specimens to publicize and explain to the masses during fairs (i.e. markets), so that the masses paid attention to the harvesting and selling of local and special products. The result of doing so has not only increased the income of farmers, but also developed the store's business.

### 贵州省雷山县民族贸易商店  根据苗族人民需要供应物资

    贵州省雷山县民族贸易商店
    根据苗族人民需要供应物资
    贵州省雷山县民族贸易商店根据少数民族需要，大量供应农具和日用品，收购土产特产，得到少数民族的欢迎。
    雷山县位于贵州省东南部的边远山区，全县百分之九十以上的居民是苗族。今春雷山县民族贸易商店在当地人民政府领导下，曾组织小组深入山区进行调查研究工作，根据苗族农民缺乏农具的情况，决定以供应农具为主要经营业务。从二月份起，即按各地需要农具的数量，就地组织加工。为了使农具合乎群众的心意，在加工时，邀请了有生产经验的老农民参加指导。今年一月到九月，共供应犁、耙、镰刀等农具六千九百多件。在经营百货日用品方面，也按苗族人民的需要去组织货源。民族贸易商店曾到贵阳、镇远、都匀等地采购了苗族人民喜爱的花线、被面、士林布，准备了充足的铁锅、棉絮、棉被、棉衣等物品。
    雷山县地区辽阔，集镇较少，为了便利苗族人民购买物品，贸易商店除了组织私商下乡外，并用“货郎担”把货物挑到边远农村去。秋收前，商店的货郎担曾翻过苗岭山脉的主峰雷公山到离城九十里的方祥乡，供应了价值三百多万元的日用品。
    在收土产特产品时，由于苗族农民不熟悉产品的品种和规格，民族贸易商店就把当地出产的麦冬、半夏、天门冬等栽在花盆里，逢场（即集市）时就以这些标本向群众宣传解说，使群众重视采售土特产品。这样做的结果，既增加了农民的收入，也开展了商店的业务。
