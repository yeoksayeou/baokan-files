    Fair Distribution, Satisfied Cooperative Members
    The Lian Quanbao Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Fuzhuang Village, Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, improved its grain distribution method during this year's autumn harvest. All 139 mu of millet in the cooperative have now been harvested and distributed. Last year, when the cooperative was first established, the distribution ratio of autumn grain was not appropriate, and the estimation of yield was also inaccurate. Not only was the grain distribution chaotic, but there were also many disagreements among the cooperative members. Some who should have received more received less, and some who should have received less received more, making it very difficult to make corrections and adjustments. Although the crops grew well this year, the cooperative members had many concerns due to the distribution issue. Lian Quanbao, the cooperative's director, saw that the distribution problem had become the key to consolidating the agricultural production cooperative. Before the crops were harvested, he and the cooperative's cadres went to the fields to observe and compare, carefully estimated the yield of various crops, determined the distribution ratio, and made a distribution budget based primarily on labor. After deducting various investments and public accumulation funds, it was calculated that each labor day could be allocated 19 jin of unprocessed grain. With this standard, the distribution was carried out as the harvest progressed. The cooperative members had a clear understanding, and their minds were not preoccupied with the grain distribution, greatly increasing their enthusiasm for production. During the harvest, those who harvested continued harvesting, and those who plowed the land went to plow with peace of mind. The work was carried out in an orderly manner. Because the original yield estimate was relatively accurate, and slight adjustments were made after each field was harvested, the process was simple and easy to implement, the distribution was fair, and the cooperative members were satisfied.

    Timely Distribution, Reduced Waste
    The Xizhanggeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiexian County, Shanxi Province, has begun distributing the autumn harvest. This year, the cooperative planted a total of 500 mu of cotton fields. According to statistics on September 24, 14,000 jin of seed cotton have been picked. According to the pre-determined distribution plan, the cooperative members have already received an initial distribution, totaling 10 million yuan in Renminbi.
    The cooperative's specific distribution method is as follows: 1. Cotton is picked by groups in sections, ensuring that it is picked, dried, and sunned as it opens. Women are organized to pick out the dry petals and inferior petals when sunning the cotton in order to separate the good from the bad and ensure quality; 2. The sun-dried seed cotton is ginned into lint by two cotton ginning machines specially set up by the cooperative. When 1,000 jin is accumulated, it is sent to the supply and marketing cooperative. The supply and marketing cooperative inspects the grade, weighs it, and issues a receipt to the agricultural production cooperative, which then receives payments in installments; 3. Cooperative members can pre-borrow 70% of the total harvest they are entitled to in installments.
    Everyone agrees that this method is good. First, it overcomes the difficulties of matching good and bad cotton when distributing seed cotton and the lack of storage facilities. At the same time, it allows the harvest to be distributed to the cooperative members in a timely manner and overcomes the waste that can easily occur during centralized storage.
                                                                             (Han Wenxuan)
    Exchanging Labor Management Experiences
    Before the autumn harvest, Xiyang, Jincheng, and other counties in Shanxi Province convened meetings of agricultural production cooperative directors and resident full-time cadres to exchange labor management experiences and prepare for the autumn harvest. At the meeting, everyone agreed that implementing labor quotas and contracting work in agricultural production cooperatives is key to increasing cooperative members' enthusiasm and ensuring the realization of increased production plans. In the past, before the Dingyu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiyang County implemented contracting work, cooperative members had to wait for the cooperative director to assign tasks every day before going to the fields to find tools. Once they arrived at the fields, they had to wait for everyone to arrive before starting work. Everyone was vying for light work and avoiding heavy work, prioritizing speed over quality. As a result, the public's impression of cooperative members was: "Late to the fields, quick to return, many breaks, little and poor-quality work." But since the implementation of contracting work, this situation has immediately changed, and labor efficiency has greatly improved. According to statistics from 29 cooperatives in Xiyang that have implemented contracting work, a total of 7,924 mu of autumn fields originally required 9,877 labor days. Due to the implementation of contracting work and the increased enthusiasm of cooperative members, only 8,044 labor days were actually used, saving 1,833 labor days. This method has also promoted women's participation in production. Agricultural production cooperatives in Shuidai Village, Huguan County, and other places have mobilized 80% of the women to work in the fields. After discussion, all localities are determined to improve labor management and do a good job in the autumn harvest.

      Careful Harvesting Increases Yields
    Farmers in the Shijingshan District of Beijing's suburbs have already devised various methods to increase yields during the autumn harvest. The Yang Dechun mutual aid team in Yamenkou Township has adopted a "harvest and cultivate simultaneously" approach. Team member Wang Jinde picked peanuts while plowing and harrowing a peanut field, resulting in the collection of 70 jin of peanuts from three mu of land. The Mu Shucai mutual aid team has established a method to improve labor efficiency, proposing that work should be fast and meticulous. Each person is credited with one work point for plowing eight fen of peanut land per day. After plowing, work points are assessed based on the number of peanuts left in the ground. Mu Zhenhe, a farmer from Xihuang Village, inspected the cut grain stalks again after threshing and picked out many grain ears. He also threshed the grain that had been threshed once again, resulting in an additional yield of more than seven dou. To cultivate wheat well, the Yang Dechun mutual aid team plans to remove the grain stubble from the fields when planting wheat to avoid losing wheat seeds and reducing seedling breakage. In terms of conservation, farmers in various townships have also developed plans based on their specific circumstances. Some farmers in Bajiao Township, who used to feed sweet potatoes to pigs, have now proposed to conserve sweet potatoes and use sweet potato leaves to feed pigs.

    Turning Over and Threshing Straw to Recover Lost Grain and Increase Income
    Farmers in Tushan Township, Xuan Cheng County, Anhui Province are responding to the state's call to increase production and conserve grain by actively turning over and threshing rice straw to recover lost grain. Calculated at 10 jin of grain recovered from each mu of rice straw, the township's total of more than 8,000 mu of medium-season rice can increase income by more than 80,000 jin of grain, enough to feed 140 people for a year.
    The reasons for the loss of grain on rice straw are twofold: first, some rice is not dry enough during the autumn harvest and is difficult to thresh; second, farmers use threshing barrels to thresh, which cannot thresh very cleanly. Therefore, rice straw that has been threshed still needs to be turned over and threshed again. In previous years, farmers in Tushan Township would wait until agricultural activities were less busy after October to turn over and thresh rice straw. By then, the grain on the rice straw would have already become moldy and could only be used to feed pigs and chickens after threshing. This year, farmers in Tushan Township responded to the state's call to increase production and conserve grain by turning over and threshing rice straw in advance. The grain threshed is very fresh. Liu Zhengfa, a farmer from Xiaozhuang Village, and several women threshed the rice straw from 6.8 mu of land and recovered an average of more than 20 jin of rice per mu. Zhang Shaochai, a farmer from Xiaohe Village, threshed the rice straw from two mu of land and recovered 14 jin of rice per mu. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Guangdong Late Rice Harvest Promises Well
    Guangdong's late rice is growing well, and the rice has entered the panicle initiation stage. If there is no wind damage, a good harvest of late rice is expected this year.
    In order to ensure a good harvest of late rice this year, party and government departments at all levels are leading the masses of farmers to actively process and add fertilizer to make up for the losses suffered by crops due to drought and other natural disasters. In Lianjiang County, Yuexi District, it is generally done to weed three times and fertilize twice. Farmers in Chaoan County, Yuedong District, have applied more fertilizer to this year's late rice than in the three years before liberation combined; now the rice seedlings are more than three feet tall. In order to protect the rice seedlings, make the rice roots grow deep, and the rice stalks grow strong, to prevent lodging and increase the wind and water resistance of the rice seedlings, they are carrying out drainage and irrigation work. Farmers in Lianjiang County reported that this year's late rice is not only better than last year's late rice, but also better than anything they have seen in decades.
                                                                            (Wu Erxiang)

    在秋收的季节里
    分配合理，社员满意
    山西陵川县复庄村连全保农林畜牧生产合作社，今年秋收中改进了分粮办法，现在全社一百三十九亩谷子，已经打毕分完。该社去年刚办社时，秋粮分配比例不够妥当，对产量估计也出入很大，不但分粮时手忙脚乱，而且社员之间闹了很多意见，有的应该多分却少分了，有的应该少分却多分了，再退补时十分困难。今年庄稼长得虽然好，社员却因为分配问题，思想顾虑很大。社长连全保看到分配问题成了巩固农业生产合作社的关键，就在庄稼快收割时，同社里的干部到田里进行观察评比，审慎地估计了各种庄稼的产量，确定了分配比例，作出以劳力为主的分配预算，除去各种投资和公积金等外，算出每个劳动日可分到原粮十九斤。有了这个标准就随打随分，社员心里有了底，心事不挂在分粮上了，生产积极性大大提高。收割时，收割的收割，犁地的就去安心犁地，工作有条不紊。因为原来估计产量比较准确，在打完每场后又稍加调整，简单易行，分的公平，社员都满意。

    及时分配，减少浪费
    山西解县西张耿农业生产合作社，开始分配秋季收获物。该社今年共种五百亩棉田，据九月二十四日统计，已摘下籽棉一万四千斤，按照预定分配方案，社员已经预分了一次，合人民币一千万元。
    该社具体分配办法是：一、按组分片摘花，做到随开随摘随晒，并在晒花时组织妇女拣花（即拣去干瓣、劣瓣），以便分开好坏，保证规格；二、晒过的籽棉，社内专设两辆轧花车，随时轧成皮棉，够一千斤时即送交供销合作社，由供销合作社验级过秤，供销合作社给农业生产合作社开收花单据，农业生产合作社就分期领款；三、社员按自己应分收获物总数的百分之七十分期预借。
    大家一致认为这种办法好，首先克服了分籽棉时好坏不易搭配和缺乏仓库的困难，同时，又可以把收获物及时分配到社员手中，并克服了集中保管时容易发生的浪费现象。　　　　　　（韩文轩）
    交流劳动管理经验
    山西昔阳、晋城等县秋收前召开了农业生产合作社社长和住社专职干部会议，交流劳动管理经验，迎接秋收。会上大家一致认识到农业生产合作社实行劳动定额包工，是提高社员积极性，保证增产计划实现的关键。昔阳丁峪农业生产合作社在没有实行包工时，社员每天上地以前，都要等社长分配营生后，才去找工具，到了地里，要等人齐了才动弹，大家都在抢轻活，推重活，图快不图好。因而群众对合作社社员的印象是：“上地迟，回来快，休息多，营生做得少又坏。”但自从实行包工以后，这种情况就立刻转变了，劳动效率大大提高。据昔阳实行包工的二十九个社的统计，共七千九百二十四亩秋田，原包工需九千八百七十七个，因实行包工发挥了社员积极性，实际用工八千零四十四个就完成了，省工一千八百三十三个。这种办法也推动了妇女参加生产。壶关水台底等地的农业生产合作社发动百分之八十的妇女下了地。经过讨论，各地都决心改进劳动管理，做好秋收工作。

      细打细收增加收获量
    北京郊区石景山区农民，在秋收中已经想出各种办法增加收获量。衙门口乡杨德春互助组“随收随耕”，组员王金德在耕耙花生地时，一面耕一面拣花生，结果在三亩地里就拣了七十斤。穆书才互助组订了提高劳动效率的办法，提出干活要快要细，刨花生时每人每天刨八分地算做一工，刨完后，再根据地里掉花生多少评工分。西黄村农民穆振河在捆草时，把掐过穗的谷草又检查一遍，结果拣出很多谷穗，并把压过一遍的谷又压了一遍，共多收了七斗多。为了种好小麦，杨德春互助组计划在种麦时，把谷茬从地里拣出，以免损失麦籽，减少断苗现象。在节约方面，各乡农民也根据自己不同情况，订出了计划。八角乡有些农民，过去都用白薯喂猪，现在都提出要把白薯节约下来，用白薯叶喂猪。　　　　　　　（周际参）
    翻打稻草上的遗谷增加收入
    安徽省宣城县土山乡农民响应国家增产节约粮食的号召，正在积极翻打稻草上遗留的谷粒。以每亩稻草打谷十斤计算，全乡八千多亩中稻共可增加八万多斤粮食的收入，可供一百四十人吃一年。
    稻草上遗留谷粒的原因，一是秋收时部分稻子未干，不易脱粒；另一是农民在打场时使用禾桶掼打，不能掼得很干净。因此，经过掼打后的稻草，仍需要重新翻打。往年，土山乡农民总要等到十月以后农事活动稍闲时才翻打稻草，那时稻草上的谷粒已经发霉，打下以后也只能用来喂猪喂鸡。今年，土山乡农民响应国家增产节约粮食的号召，提前翻打稻草，打下的谷粒都很新鲜。小庄村农民刘正发和几个妇女打了六亩八分田的稻草，平均每亩就打了二十多斤稻谷。小何村农民张绍才打了两亩田的稻草，每亩也打了十四斤稻谷。（新华社）
    广东晚稻丰收有望
    广东晚稻生长良好，稻子已进入胎穗阶段，如无风害，今年晚稻丰收有望。
    为了保证今年晚稻丰收，各地党政部门领导农民群众积极加工加肥，以补救作物因遭受旱灾和其他自然灾害的袭击所受的损失。粤西区廉江县一般做到耘草三次，施肥二次。粤东区潮安县农民今年晚稻所施的肥料，比解放以前三年合起来还要多；现在禾苗已长三尺多高，农民们为了保育禾苗，使稻根长得深，禾秆长得硬，以防止倒伏和增加禾苗的抗风抗水能力，正在进行排水灌水工作。廉江县农民反映：今年晚稻不但比去年晚稻好，就是数十年来也没看见过。
