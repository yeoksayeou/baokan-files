    Strengthen the Connections Between Various Professional Designs
    Modern architecture, whether industrial or civil, has a very wide range of connections, and the work is intricately complex. Therefore, design work must have detailed divisions of labor. At present, our design units generally have various groups with different design projects, such as process layout, general layout, architecture, reinforced concrete structures, roof frame structures, water supply and drainage, heating and ventilation, power lighting, transportation and installation, and gas supply. If these groups do not communicate with each other or the connections are improper during the engineering design process, it will cause many troubles and losses in construction and in production or use after the completion of the project.
    However, the connection work in our design units is currently not done well, so that some engineering designs are seriously disjointed and full of contradictions. The reasons for this situation, I think, are on the one hand because the designers do not have enough understanding of the importance of mutual connection, and some individuals even settle for "going their own way"; on the other hand, it is also because there is still a lack of a complete connection system in the design units.
    Designers' lack of attention to mutual connection is mainly manifested in the following aspects:
    First, they are not accustomed to using collective cooperation to complete the overall task, and they lack a sense of the overall situation. For example, people who work on architecture only appreciate the facade they designed; if the ventilation group requires opening many towering ventilation ducts through the roof, and the boiler group requires erecting some chimneys on the roof, they will be very dissatisfied, thinking that this will destroy the beauty of the facade. But they do not understand that: the beauty of the facade is important, but if the people living inside cannot get good ventilation, it will affect their health; at the same time, since life requires boilers, there will naturally be chimneys. This kind of thinking that does not consider the overall needs but emphasizes one's own interests, and is not happy to cooperate collectively but is nostalgic for individual "masterpieces" is obviously wrong.
    Another type of person is "afraid of trouble." They think that the best way to work is to "connect with as few people as possible," otherwise it will "add a lot of trouble out of thin air." For example, some civil engineering designers feel that it is an "extra burden" for the electrical group, ventilation group, and water supply group to add many holes and niches to their drawings. For example, in the design process, if a group has modifications and changes, although they know that it is related to other groups, they will not notify other groups in order to avoid a trip, because "it will take time if others disagree." As a result, it either causes disputes or a certain group has to revise and rework. Many facts show that this "fear of trouble" approach not only cannot reduce trouble, but will add many avoidable troubles to the entire work.
    There are also some designers who take an irresponsible attitude towards connection issues. For example, when designing a certain office building, the roof frame group and the architecture group once argued over who should draw the detailed drawing of the joint of the truss, both saying that they should not draw it themselves, regardless of the fact that this unnecessary quarrel would delay the design progress. For example, in the design of a certain factory building office building, the architect originally decided on two windows side by side, but because the structural group wanted to place a beam, they changed it to one window. But they did not consider that this would have a great impact on the heating group, so they just continued to do it themselves, resulting in a major rework for the heating group.
    Therefore, if we want to strengthen the mutual connection between design units, we must first solve the problem ideologically. Only when everyone recognizes the importance of strengthening connections can they take the initiative to carry out connections in a timely manner.
    However, it is not enough to just pay attention to it ideologically. To do a good job in connection, there must be a certain system to guarantee it. According to our experience, the following systems should be established first:
    1. Chief Responsibility System. Our past many lessons of failure have proved that a project design, especially a more complex design, must establish a chief responsibility system; otherwise, the entire design will fall into a state of decentralization and confusion. The responsibility of the chief person in charge is to master various design projects, assign tasks to various professional design groups, formulate overall work plans and work progress, urge various professional groups to give each other conditions, ensure the establishment and implementation of connection contracts, convene connection meetings, and understand and solve the problems encountered by various professional groups in the design process. With such a system, engineering designers can get a reasonable division of labor and cooperate closely with each other to complete the national task.
    In order to strengthen the due responsibilities of each design group, the chief design person in charge generally does not interfere with the technical issues of each group; but when the design is completed, it is necessary to review the main content of the drawings of each design group, such as the overall plan, the places where each group is related, the basic operating system, and the prospects for development. When the chief design person in charge carries out the work, it should be done through the person in charge of each professional group; some major issues must be submitted to the higher authorities for approval; in addition, it should also contact the production unit and the construction unit. In this way, the chief design person in charge truly becomes the mastermind of an engineering design and the leader of a successful comprehensive design.
    2. Connection Contract System. In order to avoid design disconnection and mutual contradiction, there must be a connection contract system when carrying out the design. That is, at the beginning of the design, according to different design rules and design starting points
    (such as workshop design starting from process, boiler room starting from power professional, office building starting from civil engineering professional), the content and date of mutual technical conditions given by each professional group should be stipulated. Only by interlacingly providing sufficient technical conditions according to the characteristics of each engineering design can we ensure that each group can carry out its work smoothly without stopping work and waiting for materials. In the past, our professional groups often caused passive work and rework waste due to the untimely or poorly made conditions given to each other.
    3. Mutual Proofreading and Review System. This is an important step to ensure connection. That is, when the design comes to an end and the original drawings and tracings are produced, each group must submit the drawings involving other professions to the relevant groups for careful proofreading of principles and details. If any discrepancies are found during proofreading or new suggestions are put forward, a review outline can be drafted, and the person in charge of each professional group should take out the drawings related to each group for discussion, and come to a conclusion in a pragmatic manner and in accordance with the principles that are conducive to the work and conducive to the whole, and then everyone should abide by it. All drawings must be signed and agreed by the person in charge of each profession and the chief design person in charge before they can be sent to the construction unit.
    Finally, during the entire course of the work, if any problems occur, each group should study and discuss with each other at any time. In particular, the problems that occur in preliminary design and technical design need to be negotiated with each other and must not be decided independently. Only in this way will the designed product be correct and comprehensive.

### 加强各种专业设计的联系

    加强各种专业设计的联系
    近代化的建筑，无论是工业建筑或民用建筑，它的联系面是非常广的，工作的进行是错综复杂的。因此，设计工作必须要有细致的分工。目前我们的设计单位一般都有工艺布置、总图、建筑、钢筋混凝土结构、房架结构、上下水道、暖气通风、动力照明、运输安装和气体供应等设计项目不同的诸小组。在工程设计过程中，这些小组之间如果互不通气或联系不当，将招致施工上及工程落成后生产或使用上的许多麻烦和损失。
    但是，目前我们设计单位中的联系工作恰恰做得不好，以致有些工程设计严重脱节，矛盾百出。所以有这种情况，我认为一方面是由于设计人员对互相联系的重要性认识不够，个别的人甚至安于“各自为政”；另一方面，也因为设计单位中还缺乏完整的联系制度。
    设计人员不重视相互联系，主要表现在以下几方面：
    首先是不习惯用集体合作的方法来完成总的任务，没有全局观念。譬如搞建筑的人专欣赏自己所设计的立面；假如通风组要求通过屋顶开许多林立的通风筒，锅炉组要求在屋顶上竖起一些烟囱，他就会大为不满，认为这样是破坏了立面的美观。但他没有理解到：立面的好看固属重要，但生活在里面的人得不到良好的通风，将会影响身体健康；同时，生活上既然需要锅炉，便自然要有烟囱。这种不考虑全面需要而强调自己兴趣，不乐于集体合作而留恋个人“杰作”的思想，显然是不对的。
    另外有一种人是“怕麻烦”。他们觉得工作以“尽量少联系人为妙”，否则将“凭空添上许多麻烦”。譬如有的土木建筑设计人员对于电气组、通风组、水道组要在自己图纸上加上许多洞口和壁龛，感到是“额外负担”。又譬如在设计过程中，某组有了修改和变动，虽然知道与别组有关，但为了怕跑一趟路，“别人不同意还要耽误时间”，于是便不去通知别组。结果不是引起争论便是某一组不得不修改返工。很多的事实说明，这种“怕麻烦”的做法，不但不能减少麻烦，反而会给整个工作增添许多可以避免的麻烦。
    还有一些设计人员对联系问题采取不负责任的态度。如设计某号办公大楼时，房架组与建筑组曾为人字屋架的接头大样究竟应该谁画而争执不下，都说这不应该自己画，而不顾这种无谓的争吵会耽误设计进度。又如在某号厂房办公大楼的设计中，建筑设计员原来决定的并排两个窗子，因为结构组要放梁而改成了一个窗子。但他们没有考虑这对暖气组有很大影响，只顾自己做下去，结果使得暖气组大返工。
    所以，要想加强设计单位互相之间的联系，必须首先从思想上解决问题，只有大家认识了加强联系的重要意义之后，才能主动地及时地进行联系。
    但是，只是思想上重视是不够的，要做好联系工作，还必须有一定的制度来保证。根据我们的体验，目前应该先建立下面几种制度：
    一、总负责人制。我们过去很多失败的教训证明：一个工程设计，尤其是比较复杂的设计，必须要建立总负责人制；否则会使整个设计陷于分散和混乱的状态。总负责人的责任是掌握各种设计项目，给各专业设计组分配任务，制定总的工作计划和工作进程，督促各专业组互给条件，保证订立与执行联系合同，召开联系会议，了解及解决各专业组在设计过程中所发生的问题。有了这样的制度，才能使工程设计人员得到合理的分工，互相密切配合来完成国家任务。
    为了加强各设计组的应有职责，设计总负责人一般不干涉各组的技术问题；但在设计完成的时候，需要审查各设计组图纸的主要内容，如总平面图、各组关连的地方、操作的基本系统与发展前途等。设计总负责人进行工作时，应该通过各专业组的负责人；某些重大问题，必须呈请上级批准；此外，还应与生产单位及施工单位取得联系。这样，设计总负责人便真正成为一个工程设计的主脑，成为成功的综合设计的领导人。
    二、联系合同制度。为了避免设计脱节与互相矛盾，在进行设计时必须有联系合同制度。即在设计开始的时候，根据不同的设计规律与设计起点
    （如车间设计由工艺开始，锅炉房由动力专业开始，办公楼由土建专业开始）订出各专业组互给技术条件的内容与日期。只有按照每个工程设计的特点来交错地互给足够的技术条件，才能保证各组顺利地进行工作，不致停工待料。这种合同应该经过各专业负责人充分讨论，各组必须严格执行。以往我们各专业组由于互相给的条件不及时，或者给的条件粗制滥造，常常造成工作被动与返工浪费。
    三、互相校对与会审制度。这是保证联系的重要步骤。即当设计告一段落，底图及描图出产的时候，每个组牵涉到别的专业的图纸，必须交各有关组仔细校对原则及细节问题。如果在校对时发现了什么不符的地方或提出了新的建议，即可拟出会审提纲，由各专业组负责人拿出和各组有关系的图纸进行讨论，实事求是地，按照利于工作，利于整体的原则得出结论，然后大家遵照执行。所有的图纸，在送到施工单位之前，必须经过各专业负责人及设计总负责人签署同意才可发出。
    最后，在整个工作进行的过程中，发生了什么问题，各组应该随时互相研究讨论。特别是在初步设计与技术设计中发生的问题，更需要互相协商而绝不能单独决定。只有这样，设计出来的成品才会是正确的和全面的。
