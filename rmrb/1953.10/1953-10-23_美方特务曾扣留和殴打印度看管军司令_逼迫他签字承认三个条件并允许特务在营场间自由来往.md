Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 22nd: Kuomintang special agents posing as prisoner-of-war representatives not only beat Indian officers in the prisoner-of-war camps, but also used wooden sticks to beat Major General Thorat, the commander of the Indian Custodial Force, and forced him to sign three conditions.

Ten Chinese People's Volunteer prisoners of war who returned from Camp 31 witnessed this incident. The incident occurred on September 25th. On this day, Ying Xiangyun and Liu Wenjie, the special agent leaders of Camp 31, directed special agents to detain Indian officers and General Thorat, demanding that the Indian Custodial Force return Wang Xu, the acting deputy captain and translator of Camp 31, who had risked his life to apply for repatriation. However, Kuomintang special agents Ying Xiangyun and Liu Wenjie later even posed as prisoner-of-war representatives and attended the Chinese "prisoner-of-war representative" meeting convened by General Thimayya on the morning of October 15th, the first day of the explanation work. At this meeting, General Thimayya tried to "persuade" these Kuomintang special agents to allow the prisoners of war to leave the camp to listen to the explanations from the Korean and Chinese side.

Zhu Shuwu, a Chinese People's Volunteer prisoner of war who applied for repatriation on the first day of the explanation work, said: "After the Kuomintang special agents detained General Thorat, they forced him to sign the three conditions put forward by the special agents. The three conditions were: First, admit that it was wrong for Indian soldiers to cut the barbed wire of the camp during this incident; second, send Wang Xu back within three days; third, allow the United States to send representatives to solve the problems of the 'prisoners of war'." Zhu Shuwu explained that Liu Wenjie had told the special agents: "Having the United States send representatives can both report news from the outside and give us instructions at any time." In addition to requiring General Thorat to sign the above three conditions, they also wanted him to verbally agree that the special agents could freely enter and leave the barbed wire between the camps, communicate with each other, transmit secret instructions, and have the Indian troops forward letters to the United Nations forces on their behalf.

Zhu Shuwu was only a few meters away from General Thorat when he was forced to sign. He personally saw the special agents ask General Thorat to rewrite the conditions three times, and then ask General Thorat to affix his seal. General Thorat said he had no seal. The special agents then asked him to sign and put his fingerprint on it. General Thorat did as he was told.

Zhu Shuwu said: "The Kuomintang special agents' actions of beating and detaining General Thorat completely violated the will of the prisoners of war. Because the road Wang Xu took is the road we want to take."

Zhu Shuwu also said that when the special agents took General Thorat into the barbed wire, the prisoners of war were still in the tents. Liu Wenjie pulled out a sharp knife more than a foot long from his boot and yelled at the tents: "Come out, take the tent poles, kill anyone who is afraid of death!" The prisoners of war had no choice but to take down the tent poles and come over to surround General Thorat and his entourage, and the special agents took the opportunity to hit General Thorat's shoulders with a few sticks.

A few minutes after General Thorat was detained, an Indian lieutenant arrived outside the barbed wire with about thirty fully armed soldiers and cut open the outer layer of barbed wire to rescue him. Just as the Indian soldiers were about to cut the second barbed wire, General Thorat stopped them. He also finally admitted that his troops were wrong to cut the barbed wire.

Also detained with General Thorat were several other Indian officers (including a major and a lieutenant), as well as more than a dozen Indian soldiers with wooden sticks protecting them. When the special agents surrounded them, the Indian soldiers raised their wooden sticks to defend themselves. At this time, General Thorat ordered them to sit on the ground. When General Thorat was forced to sign and was about to be released, Liu Wenjie asked the Indian soldiers to leave their wooden sticks behind, and General Thorat agreed. The Indian soldiers had to obey Thorat's orders and walked out of the barbed wire empty-handed.

The incident of General Thorat being forced to sign was publicized by the special agents as a great "victory" for them. Liu Wenjie told everyone that Indian soldiers were not scary. He handed the wooden sticks left by the Indian soldiers to the special agent guards to beat the prisoners of war who wanted to return home.

The nine Chinese People's Volunteer prisoners of war who returned from Camp 31 with Zhu Shuwu on the first day of the explanation work all pointed out that after Ying Xiangyun and Liu Wenjie held the "prisoner-of-war representative" meeting, they were also taken to the explanation site to observe. When they returned to the camp, they drew a diagram of the explanation tent on the blackboard and threatened the prisoners of war, saying: No one is allowed to go through the back door (referring to the door to apply for repatriation), you can only go through the front door to return. If anyone goes through the back door, they will be caught and killed on the spot! While the prisoners of war were waiting for the explanation, Liu Wenjie even sat in a jeep driven by Indian soldiers, intimidating the prisoners of war back and forth. The returning prisoners of war unanimously pointed out that if the special agents were not isolated and guarded, the prisoners of war would have no way to freely express their desire for repatriation.

    美方特务曾扣留和殴打印度看管军司令
    逼迫他签字承认三个条件并允许特务在营场间自由来往
    【新华社开城二十二日电】冒充战俘代表的国民党特务在战俘营内不仅曾殴打印度军官，而且还用木棒殴打了印度看管军司令托拉特少将，并逼迫他签字承认了三个条件。
    从第三十一号营场回来的十个志愿军被俘人员，都曾目睹这一事件。这个事件发生在九月二十五日。这一天，三十一号营场的特务头子应祥云和刘文杰指挥特务扣押了印度军官和托拉特将军，要求印度看管部队送还已经冒死申请遣返的第三十一号营场代理副大队长兼翻译王旭。但是，国民党特务应祥云和刘文杰后来竟然还装作战俘代表，出席了十月十五日解释工作开始那天早晨蒂迈雅将军召开的中国“战俘代表”会议。在这次会议上，蒂迈雅将军试图“说服”这些国民党特务，要他们让战俘出营场来听取朝中方面的解释。
    在解释工作第一天申请遣返回来的志愿军被俘人员朱书武说：“国民党特务们在扣押托拉特将军以后，逼迫他在特务提出的三个条件上签了字。这三个条件就是：第一，承认印度士兵在这次事件中剪破营场铁丝网是错误的；第二，限三天以内把王旭送回去；第三，允许美国派代表来解决‘战俘’们的问题。”朱书武解释说，刘文杰曾对特务们讲过：“要美国派代表来，既可以报告外面的消息，又可以随时给我们指示。”特务除了要托拉特将军在以上三个条件上签字外，还要他在口头上答应特务可以自由出入各个营场之间的铁丝网，互相通信，传达秘密指示，由印度部队代转给联合国军的信件。
    在托拉特将军被迫签字的时候，朱书武离他只有几公尺远。他亲眼看见特务要托拉特将军三次改写条件，然后要托拉特将军盖章。托拉特将军说他没有图章。特务就要他签字并按上指印。托拉特将军都照办了。
    朱书武说：“国民党特务殴打和扣押托拉特将军的行动，是完全违背战俘们的意志的。因为王旭所走的路，也就是我们要走的路。”
    朱书武还说，当特务把托拉特将军扣进铁丝网的时候，战俘们还在帐篷里。刘文杰就从靴子里抽出一把一尺多长锋利的刀子，朝着帐篷吼叫：“快出来，把帐篷杆子拿上，谁怕死就杀了谁！”战俘们只得拆下帐篷杆子走来，把托拉特将军和他的随从们围了起来，特务分子们就乘乱向托拉特将军的肩膀打了几棒。
    托拉特将军被扣几分钟以后，一个印度上尉带着三十名左右全副武装的士兵，赶到铁丝网外边，剪开外层铁丝网准备救他。当印度士兵正要剪第二道铁丝网的时候，托拉特将军制止了他们的行动。他并且在最后被迫承认他的部队剪铁丝网是错误的。
    和托拉特将军同时被扣的，还有另外的几个印度军官（其中有一名少校、一名上尉），还有保护他们的十多名手持木棒的印度士兵。当特务们包围他们的时候，印度士兵举起木棒准备自卫，这时候，托拉特将军就命令他们坐在地上。在托拉特将军被迫签字、将要被释放的时候，刘文杰要印度士兵把木棒留下，托拉特将军同意了。印度士兵不得不服从托拉特的命令，空着手走出了铁丝网。
    托拉特将军被迫签字这件事，被特务们宣传成他们的一个很大的“胜利”。刘文杰逢人就说，印度兵不可怕。他把印度兵留下来的木棒，交给了特务警备队员，来殴打想要回国的战俘。
    解释工作开始的那天和朱书武一块从三十一号营场归来的九名志愿军被俘人员都指出：应祥云和刘文杰开过“战俘代表”会议以后，还曾被带到解释场所去观察。他们回到营场时，在黑板上画了解释帐篷的图样，威胁战俘说：谁也不准走后门（指申请遣返的门），只能走前门回来，要是有人走后门，抓住了当场打死！在战俘们等待解释的时候，刘文杰还坐在印度士兵开的吉普车上，来回恐吓战俘。归来的被俘人员一致指出，如果不把特务们隔离看管起来，战俘们是没有办法自由表达他们要求遣返的意志的。
