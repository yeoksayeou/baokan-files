Comrades, Commissioners, Ladies and Gentlemen:

After we achieved victory in the Korean armistice, we, representing all the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, returned to the motherland to participate in the National Day celebrations. We were very excited to see the rapid progress in all aspects of construction in the motherland after being away for nearly three years. All the victories achieved by the Volunteer Army in Korea fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army in the past three years are inseparable from the full support and encouragement of the people of the motherland. On behalf of all the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, I would like to pay tribute to our beloved great leader Chairman Mao! Greetings to all compatriots and comrades across the country!

Commander Peng Dehuai has already made a detailed report on the victories and future tasks of the Volunteer Army in its three years of fighting abroad. Today, I would first like to introduce to you the summer counterattack campaign launched by our army on the Korean front before the armistice, to illustrate the fact that the Volunteer Army is getting stronger and stronger: increasingly powerful in equipment, increasingly advanced in tactics, and increasingly high in morale. Then I will talk about the reasons for achieving this victory.

This campaign started on May 13. At that time, the American invaders were constantly creating side issues in the prisoner of war issue negotiations, and the Li Chengwan bandit gang was doing everything possible to obstruct and undermine the realization of the Korean armistice. In order to strive for an early fair and reasonable armistice, and to crush the enemy's conspiracy to undermine the armistice negotiations and various provocative actions, our army launched a counterattack on twenty enemy strongholds, large and small, and eliminated more than 4,000 enemies. Subsequently, on the basis of victory, from May 27 to June 23, our army carried out the second stage of operations, launching sixty-five counterattacks on fifty-one enemy defensive positions. In several consecutive battles, we created examples of annihilating most of an enemy regiment and breaking through the defensive positions of an enemy regiment at one time.

After our army's counterattack operations had ceased and the Korean armistice negotiations had made smooth progress through our efforts, the Li Chengwan bandit gang, with the connivance of American warmongers, violated the prisoner of war repatriation agreement. Under the pretext of release, they forcibly kidnapped more than 27,000 of our captured personnel, clamoring for "northward offensive, armed reunification of Korea," and constantly provoking our army, attempting to undermine the imminent armistice. In order to strike at the enemy's frenzied anti-armistice arrogance and promote the realization of the armistice, our army organized a larger-scale third-stage counterattack on the basis of the victories of the previous two stages of counterattack. Three counterattack groups were formed on the Jincheng front in the east, middle, and west. With the cooperation of more powerful artillery fire and some tanks, starting from July 13, a counterattack was launched simultaneously along several routes against the 22-kilometer-wide front of the defensive positions held by four divisions, including the puppet Capital Division and the Sixth Division, south of Jincheng. After one hour of fighting, the enemy's positions were broken through along the entire line. Subsequently, within 24 hours, all four enemy divisions were defeated, and the troops that advanced the farthest pushed south by 18 kilometers. After that, the enemy, with the force of five divisions and with the cooperation of a large number of airplanes and artillery, launched a full-scale counterattack against our newly occupied positions. Our army then turned to resolute resistance. By July 26, we had successively repelled 1,371 large and small counterattacks by the enemy, ranging from a company to two regiments, consolidating the positions we had gained and eliminating a large number of enemies. In total, the entire campaign eliminated more than 123,000 enemies, expanded the area of ​​positions by more than 220 square kilometers, shot down and damaged more than 770 enemy aircraft, destroyed and captured 56 tanks, captured one aircraft, 301 vehicles, 607 artillery pieces of various types, 1,538 light and heavy machine guns, 11,098 rifles and short guns, and 1,120 important communication equipment. It would take more than 4,000 truck trips to transport all the captured ammunition and equipment. This huge victory severely hit the enemy's anti-armistice arrogance and promoted the rapid signing of the armistice.

However, victory does not come easily. Here, I think it is meaningful to talk about the reasons for achieving this huge victory.

First of all, this is because our army, with the full support of the people of the motherland, has been increasingly strengthened in equipment, supply, and overall combat effectiveness. Our army's artillery fire played a huge role in this counterattack. When our army counterattacked "Square Hill" on May 27, the artillery fire blasted the enemy's fortifications, barbed wire, mines, and traffic trenches to pieces, ensuring that the infantry occupied the hilltop in 18 minutes. Artillery fire also played a major role in combating the enemy's counterattacks. On July 18, the enemy used a regiment of troops to launch 42 counterattacks against a certain height of our army in three routes. Among them, 30 times, before our army's infantry even opened fire, they were defeated by our army's artillery fire. In terms of supply, our army has also improved a lot compared to two years ago.

Another reason for the victory is that our army's tactical and technical skills have been greatly improved through more than two years of combat training, and the art of coordinated operations of large units and various arms of the service has become increasingly advanced. In the summer counterattack, many battles were realized step by step completely according to the combat plan. Therefore, although we were attacking the enemy's heavily fortified deep defensive positions with tunnel fortifications at key points, our casualties were much less than the enemy's. Many battles were fought very skillfully, catching the enemy off guard. In several insertion battles, when our army broke into the enemy's battalion headquarters and regimental headquarters, we encountered enemy officers eating, drinking, playing mahjong, with the lights on. Some of them were killed or captured alive on the spot, and some who had just run out and jumped into Jeeps were captured before they even drove off. The deputy commander of the puppet Capital Division was captured alive in this way, and the commander of the puppet Mechanized Regiment was killed in this way.

Another important factor in the victory is the revolutionary heroism that our army commanders and fighters demonstrated in the summer counterattack, which was more widespread and reached a higher level. In the summer counterattack, there emerged more heroes than in the past who fought alone, cleverly annihilated the enemy, fought one against a hundred, and achieved more with less. For example, Lai Yongze, a young soldier and representative of this return visit, after fighting to the south of Heiyun Tuling, held the front line for three days and nights, using the enemy's discarded guns and ammunition and stones to repel many enemy counterattacks, killing and wounding more than 100 enemies. In an insertion operation, soldier Xia Jicheng cleverly climbed onto an enemy vehicle and grabbed an enemy, and in the pursuit of fleeing enemies, killed more than 50 enemies and captured 5 prisoners alive. When the Sixth Company of a certain unit was pursuing the enemy, the Second Squad turned over eight hills in one go, and one squad crushed an enemy company, ensuring a victory in which more than 40 enemies were captured. Such examples are too numerous to mention.

In the summer counterattack, there also emerged many commanders and fighters who persisted in commanding and fighting after being wounded, and many great soldiers who sacrificed their lives in emergencies to exchange for the overall victory, and new Yang Gengsi, Huang Jiguang or Qiu Shaoyun-style heroes emerged. For example, Luo Weixin, a communist party member and demolitionist, in a very urgent situation, in order to ensure the victorious advance of the troops, lay down on the barbed wire so that the troops could pass over him. Soldiers Li Jiafa and Li Shijie, when ammunition was exhausted, the assault troops were blocked by the enemy, and our artillery fire could not provide support, took their own bodies and pounced on the enemy's gun holes, blocking the enemy's firing points and covering the assault troops to successfully rush up, achieving the victory of the entire battle.

Why has our army grown so rapidly in just three years? I think that in addition to the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China in the Volunteer Army, and the support and encouragement given to us by the Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world, headed by the Soviet Union, the support and encouragement given to us by the people of the motherland is the main source of our army's increasing strength. The people of the motherland donated weapons to strengthen our equipment, and constantly encouraged and sent the best sons and daughters to the front line, and constantly organized comfort groups and comfort art troupes to go to the front line to offer condolences, as well as organizing extensive correspondence work with the Volunteer Army. All of this formed a huge spiritual and material force, giving the troops a great sense of emotion and encouragement. The comrades of the various condolence art troupes worked selflessly. Before the battle, they personally pinned medals printed with Chairman Mao's portrait and a dove of peace on the chests of the soldiers; handed the glorious red flag to the assault squads; pasted red strips of paper on the grenades, wrote "The Motherland Trusts You," and handed them to the soldiers of the assault team. Xiong Yunqiang, a 19-year-old new soldier, eliminated three enemy firepower points, occupied a tunnel shelter, and captured seven enemies in the counterattack south of Kehu Li, and was awarded the Second Class Merit. He said: "The comrades of the condolence group personally pinned the medals on my chest, saying that we are warriors fighting for peace. I felt full of energy in the battle and became more and more courageous." The soldiers often said: "The most beloved people must do the most beloved things," "If my combat and work are not good, I am not qualified to be one of the most beloved people." At any time, when encountering difficulties and dangers, as long as you mention "Don't forget that you are the most beloved person!" courage and wisdom will immediately come, and the difficulties will be overcome. This is an invisible but infinitely great spiritual force.

The soldier's family letters constantly sent from all parts of the motherland, the correspondence between many factories, rural areas, schools and other corners and the Volunteer Army, are constantly and at all times playing a huge role in encouraging the troops. A soldier named Yang Gouwa received a letter from home saying that everything was fine at home, except for a happy report, and hoped that he would make meritorious service on the Korean battlefield. The letter also said: The name Gouwa was given when we were oppressed and worked as cattle and horses for the landlords. Now that you have become a Volunteer soldier, every Volunteer soldier is made of steel, you should change your name to Yang Gang. After receiving this letter, the young soldier solemnly changed his name and set out the conditions for meritorious service, and really made Second Class Merit in this campaign. The vivid deeds of mutual encouragement between Dong Shigui, a volunteer soldier, and his fiancée, Gao Guizhen, were also a great encouragement to the entire army.

The motherland constantly sends outstanding new soldiers to the front line, adding new blood to the troops. They themselves bring new signs of the ever-increasing awareness of the people of the motherland. These new soldiers have a high sense of responsibility and honor as soon as they arrive, and are eager to make meritorious service and progress. As soon as they arrive at the troops, they actively study politics, study technology, and ask to participate in combat. The new soldiers have extremely high pride in the construction of the great motherland and are very fond of their hometown. The most talked about by the soldiers in their spare time is the construction of the motherland, the socialist future of the motherland, and they like to talk about the progressive examples of their families participating in production cooperatives, and their lovers or brothers and sisters participating in the Communist Youth League. They are a new generation that has grown up in the great social and political reform movement of the motherland in the past four years. Since last year, more and more new soldiers have made meritorious service and even become heroic figures, as has been proved by the Battle of Shangganling.

Now, the Korean armistice has been nearly three months, but until now, American imperialism has not shown any sincerity in seeking a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. They are doing everything possible to obstruct and delay the convening of the political conference, continuing to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war and barbarously violating the prisoner of war repatriation agreement, constantly violating the armistice agreement, and stepping up the arming and training of the Li Chengwan puppet army. Therefore, we must continue to maintain high vigilance and strict alert. We must strive to gradually stabilize the armistice situation, and at the same time, we must be ready to give a heavier blow to the enemy who dares to attack again. All the commanders and fighters of our army have the determination and confidence to complete the sacred task entrusted to us by the people of the motherland to resist US aggression and aid Korea, strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and defend the security of the motherland and peace in Asia from beginning to end. Now that the people of the motherland are continuing to deepen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, with the strong support and encouragement of the people of the whole country, we will definitely continue to work hard to improve our level of awareness and combat effectiveness, and continue to work with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army to complete this glorious task.

Thank you to the people of the motherland for your full support and encouragement! Victory and honor belong to our great motherland and our great leader Chairman Mao!

    感谢祖国人民的支援和鼓舞
    ——在政协全国委员会举行的报告会上的报告摘要
    中国人民志愿军国庆节归国观礼代表团团长　杨得志各位委员、各位先生、各位同志：
    我们在朝鲜取得了停战胜利之后，代表中国人民志愿军全体同志回到祖国来参加国庆节观礼，看到了离开将近三年的祖国在各方面建设的突飞猛进情形，感到很兴奋。三年来，志愿军在朝鲜与朝鲜人民军并肩作战所取得的一切胜利，都是和祖国人民的全力支援和鼓舞分不开的。我谨代表中国人民志愿军全体同志，向我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席致敬！向全国同胞和全体同志致敬！
    关于志愿军出国作战三年来的胜利和今后任务，彭德怀司令员已经作过详细的报告。我今天想首先向大家介绍一下停战以前我军在朝鲜前线所举行的夏季反击战役，从这个战役来说明志愿军越战越强：在装备上越打越强大，在战术上越打越进步，在士气上越打越高涨的情形。然后再谈谈取得这一胜利的原因。
    这一战役是从五月十三日开始的。当时，正是美国侵略者在战俘问题谈判中不断节外生枝，李承晚匪帮千方百计地阻挠和破坏朝鲜停战实现的时候。我军为了争取早日达成公平合理的停战，为了粉碎敌人破坏停战谈判的阴谋和各种挑衅行动，对敌人大小二十个据点发起了反击，一共歼灭了敌人四千多人。接着，我军又在胜利的基础上，从五月二十七日起到六月二十三日，进行了第二阶段作战，对敌人五十一个防御阵地进行了六十五次反击作战，在连续的几个战斗中，都创造了一次歼灭敌人一个团的大部，突破敌人一个团的防御阵地的范例。
    此后，当我军反击作战已经停止，朝鲜停战谈判在我方努力下获得了顺利进展的时候，李承晚匪帮却在美国好战分子的纵容下，破坏了战俘遣返协议，以释放为名，武力劫走我方被俘人员二万七千多人，大叫“向北进攻、武力统一朝鲜”，并不断向我军寻衅，企图破坏即将达成的停战。为了打击敌人这种疯狂的反停战的气焰，促进停战的实现，我军就在前两阶段反击作战胜利的基础上，组织了规模更大的第三阶段反击作战。在金城前线组成东、中、西三个反击集团，在更加强大的炮火和一部分坦克的配合下，从七月十三日起，向金城以南伪首都师、第六师等四个师所据守的二十二公里宽正面的防御阵地，同时分路发起了反击，经一小时战斗，全线先后突破敌军阵地，随即在二十四小时内，将敌军四个师全部打垮，前进最远的部队向南推进了十八公里。此后，敌军以五个师兵力，在大量的飞机、大炮配合下，向我军新占阵地全线反扑，我军随即转入坚决阻击，到七月二十六日止，先后打退敌人一个连至两个团兵力的一千三百七十一次的大小反扑，巩固了所得阵地，大量歼灭了敌人。总计全战役共歼灭敌人达十二万三千多人，扩展阵地面积二百二十多平方公里，击落击伤敌机七百七十多架，击毁和缴获坦克五十六辆、缴获飞机一架、汽车三百零一台、各种炮六百零七门、轻重机枪一千五百三十八挺、长短枪一万一千零九十八支、重要通讯器材一千一百二十部。缴获的弹药、器材，要有四千多台次的载重汽车才能运完。这个巨大的胜利，严重地打击了敌人反停战的气焰，促成了停战的迅速签字。
    但胜利不是轻易得来的。这里，我想再来谈谈取得这一巨大胜利的原因是有意义的。
    首先，这是因为我军在祖国人民的全力支援下，装备、供应以及整个的战斗力已经日益加强了的缘故。我军炮火在这次反击战中发挥了巨大的威力。我军在五月二十七日反击“方形山”时，炮火把敌人的工事、铁丝网、地雷、交通沟一齐炸得稀烂，保证了步兵在十八分钟内就占领了这座山头。在打击敌人反扑中，炮火也起了很大作用。七月十八日，敌人以一个团的兵力分三路向我军某高地反扑四十二次，其中有三十次还没有等到我军步兵开火，就被我军炮火打垮了。在供应上，我军也比两年以前改善得多了。
    胜利的另一个原因，就是我军在两年多的战斗锻炼中，战术技术已经大为提高，大部队、各兵种的协同作战的艺术，已经日益进步。夏季反击战中，许多战斗都是完全按照作战计划一步步地实现的。所以，我们虽然是向敌人坚固设防的、在要点上设有坑道工事的纵深防御阵地进攻，但是伤亡却比敌人少得多。许多战斗打得很技巧，打得敌人措手不及。好几个穿插战斗，在我军打进敌人的营部、团部的时候，都碰到敌人的军官正在吃饭、喝酒、打麻将，电灯通明。他们有的当时被打死了、活捉了，有的刚刚跑出去跳上吉普车，还没有开出，就做了俘虏。伪首都师副师长就是这样被活捉的，伪机甲团的团长就是这样被打死的。
    胜利的另一个重要因素，就是我军指挥员、战斗员在夏季反击战中所表现出来的更加普遍的和达到了更高水平的革命英雄主义精神。在夏季反击战中，出现了比过去更多的孤胆作战、机智歼敌、以一当百、以少胜多的英雄。比如这次归国观礼代表、青年战士赖永泽，在打到黑云吐岭以南后，在最前沿阵地坚守了三昼夜，用敌人丢下的枪弹和石头，打退了敌人许多次反扑，一个人杀伤敌人一百多人。战士夏季成在穿插作战中，一个人机智地爬上敌人汽车抓住了一个敌人，又在追歼逃敌中，打死敌人五十多名，活捉了五个俘虏。某部六连在追击敌人时，二班一下子连翻八个山头，一个班插垮了敌人一个连，保证了一次俘掳敌人四十多人的胜利。这样的事例是举不胜举的。
    在夏季反击战中，还出现了许多负伤后坚持指挥和作战的指挥员和战斗员，出现了许多在紧急情况下以牺牲自己的生命来换取整个胜利的伟大战士，涌现了新的杨根思、黄继光或者邱少云式的英雄。如共产党员、爆破手罗维新，在万分紧急情况下，为了保证部队胜利前进，自己伏在铁丝网上，让部队从他身上通过。战士李家发和李世杰都是在弹药打光、突击部队被敌人拦阻、我军炮火不及支援的紧张情况下，拿自己肉体扑向敌人的枪眼，堵塞了敌人的火力点，掩护突击部队顺利地冲上去，取得了整个战斗的胜利。
    为什么我军能在短短的三年中，成长壮大得这样快呢？我想，除了由于中国共产党在志愿军部队中的坚强领导，以及朝鲜人民和以苏联为首的世界爱好和平的人民给予我们的支援和鼓舞而外，祖国人民给予我们的支援和鼓舞，是我军力量日益强大起来的主要源泉。祖国人民捐献武器加强了我们的装备，又不断鼓励和输送最优秀的儿女到前线上来，还不断组织慰问团、慰问文工团到前线进行慰问，以及组织了广泛的和志愿军通信的工作。这一切，形成了巨大的精神力量和物质力量，给了部队很大感动和鼓舞。各个慰问文工团的同志都是忘我地工作。他们在战斗前把印有毛主席肖像和和平鸽的纪念章，亲自戴在战士们的胸前；把光荣的红旗交给突击班排；在手榴弹上贴上红纸条，写上“祖国信任你”，交给突击队的战士。十九岁的新战士熊运强在科湖里南的反击战中，消灭了敌人三个火力点，占领了一个坑道掩蔽部，俘掳了七个敌人，立了二等功。他说：“慰问团的同志亲手把纪念章戴在我的胸前，说我们是为和平而战的勇士，战斗里我满身都长劲，真是越打越勇敢。”战士们时常说：“最可爱的人一定要办最可爱的事”，“如果我的作战、工作不好，就不够一个最可爱的人的条件”。在任何时候，在碰到困难危险的时候，只要一提“不要忘了你是最可爱的人啊！”勇气、智慧马上就来了，困难就克服了，这是一种无形的然而却无比伟大的精神力量。
    从祖国各地不断寄来的战士家信，许多工厂、农村、学校以及其他各个角落和志愿军的通信，是经常地、每时每刻地起着鼓舞部队的巨大作用的。有一个叫杨狗娃的战士，接到家里的一封信，说家里一切都好，就缺个喜报，希望他在朝鲜战场立功。信上又说：狗娃这名字是在咱们受压迫、给地主当牛当马的时候起的，现在你当了志愿军，志愿军人人是钢铁，你应该改名叫杨钢。这个青年战士得到了这封信后，严肃地改了名字，订出了立功条件，在这次战役中真的立了二等功。志愿军战士董世贵的未婚妻高桂珍和未婚夫互相鼓舞的生动事迹，给全军的鼓励也是非常大的。
    祖国不断输送优秀的新战士到前线来，给部队增加了新的血液。他们本身就带来了祖国人民觉悟日益提高的新的标志。这些新战士一来就有很高的责任感与荣誉感、迫切要求立功和进步。他们一到部队就积极学习政治，学习技术，要求参加战斗。新战士对伟大祖国的建设有极高的自豪感，对自己家乡十分热爱。战士们在闲谈中谈得最多的是祖国的建设，祖国的社会主义前途，喜欢讲自己家里参加了生产合作社，爱人或兄弟妹子参加了青年团这一类进步的事例。他们是在四年来祖国伟大的社会政治改革运动中生长起来的新的一代。从去年以来，新战士立功以至成为英雄人物的愈来愈多，上甘岭战役就已证明这一点。
    现在，朝鲜停战已经快三个月了，但是，一直到现在，美帝国主义还没有表现出有谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意。他们正在千方百计地阻挠和拖延政治会议的召开，正在继续阻挠战俘的遣返和蛮横地破坏战俘遣返协议，正在不断地违反停战协议，正在加紧武装和训练李承晚伪军。因此，我们就不能不继续保持高度警惕，保持严密戒备。我们要努力争取停战局面逐步稳定下来，同时，也必须随时准备对敢于重新进攻的敌人，给以更沉重的打击。我们全军指挥员、战斗员有决心也有信心，有始有终地完成祖国人民交给我们的抗美援朝、争取和平解决朝鲜问题，以及保卫祖国安全和亚洲和平的神圣任务。现在，祖国人民正在继续深入抗美援朝运动，我们在全国人民大力支援与鼓舞下，一定继续努力提高自己的觉悟水平与战斗力，继续和朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军在一起，完成这一光荣任务。
    感谢祖国人民对我们的全力支援和鼓舞！胜利和荣誉属于我们伟大的祖国和我们伟大的领袖毛主席！        　　（新华社）
