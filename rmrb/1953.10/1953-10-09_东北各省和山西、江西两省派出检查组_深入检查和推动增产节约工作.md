    Northeast provinces and Shanxi, Jiangxi provinces dispatched inspection teams
    To deeply inspect and promote increased production and thrift work

    According to Xinhua News Agency: Party and government leading organs in Northeast provinces, Shanxi and Jiangxi provinces have transferred a large number of cadres to go deep into grassroots units to inspect and promote increased production and thrift work.

    Party and government leading cadres in Northeast provinces have led a large number of cadres to go separately to grassroots units in cities and rural areas to inspect and promote the increased production and thrift movement. In late September, Heilongjiang Province transferred 270 cadres, led by Feng Jixin, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, to inspect the development of the increased production and thrift movement at construction sites, factories, and forest areas. Liaoxi and Jilin provinces also dispatched more than 150 cadres to key units such as factories, mines, basic construction sites, railways, and forest areas to inspect and promote the increased production and thrift movement. The Liaodong Provincial Department of Industry also dispatched cadres to Andong, Liaonan, Tonghua and other regions to help local state-owned enterprises promote advanced experiences of decisive significance in conjunction with the increased production and thrift movement. Various provinces have also dispatched a large number of cadres to rural areas to lead the movement of increasing production and saving grain during the autumn harvest. In mid-September, Jilin Province extracted more than 30 cadres from the Provincial Party Committee and government organs to go to Yongji, Dunhua and other counties to lead farmers in the autumn harvest. Yang Yumin, Vice Chairman of the Rehe Provincial People's Government, and Wang Kedong, Secretary-General of the Rehe Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, led more than 50 people to nine counties, including Chaoyang, Chengde, and Chifeng, to further implement the call to "resist disasters, protect autumn harvests, and increase grain production," and to conduct in-depth inspections of autumn harvest work. In the commercial system, Jilin Province has dispatched four groups to various places to study the supply of materials in forest areas and the sales and grain purchase work of cooperatives and wholesale stores in the increased production and thrift movement. Chen Lei, Vice Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government, has arrived at various grassroots units with commercial cadres and is inspecting the completion of the commodity circulation plan and the preparation for winter material supply and grain purchase, while helping to carry out the increased production and thrift movement. More than 70 cadres in Rehe Province have gone to Beipiao, Chaoyang, Chifeng and other places to specifically help and promote grassroots units such as commerce and cooperatives to do a good job in sales.

    The provincial-level party, government organs and people's organizations of Shanxi Province have extracted more than 370 cadres before September 25, forming five inspection groups for industry, basic construction, trade, finance and taxation, and rural work, to help and promote increased production and thrift work in various regions. The inspection groups, under the leadership of Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Pei Lisheng, Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, have successively gone to twelve key factories and mines, five key basic construction sites, and four base counties of Pingshun, Yuci, Jiexian, and Yanggao, as well as key towns such as Taiyuan, Datong, Yuci, Pingyao, Linfen, Yuncheng, and Houma for inspection. In addition, the leading organs of the four cities of Taiyuan, Datong, Changzhi, and Yangquan, and various special regions, counties, and districts have also extracted many cadres to form working groups, which, in addition to working with the provincial inspection groups, have separately selected key units for level-by-level inspection. The provincial and municipal inspection groups that went to the twelve key factories and mines will first inspect the specific implementation of the increased production and thrift plans of each factory and mine, summarize the experience of combining labor emulation with strengthening planned management and technical management, help solve key problems in production, break through backward units, and strengthen financial cost management; and pay attention to preventing phenomena such as desperate rushes, reduced quality, and accidents in a timely manner. The basic construction inspection team will go deep into the construction site according to the type of project to help carry out the quality inspection movement. The rural inspection team focuses on promoting farmers in various places to do a good job in autumn harvesting, wheat planting, and autumn plowing, discovering and helping to solve various production difficulties of farmers, and carrying out the rural increased production and thrift grain movement. Finance and trade focus on inspecting the purchase of grain, cotton, local products, and special products, and the supply of production and living materials to farmers, and also inspecting the implementation of price policies in the purchase of grain and cotton, and the supply of industrial products and handicrafts. Each inspection group will also, under the unified leadership of the local party committee, adopt the method of combining key inspections with in-depth assistance and understanding the overall situation, and go deep into factories, rural areas, and grassroots production units, select good and bad examples, and summarize good experiences and commend good people and good deeds in a timely manner; for units that cannot complete the state plan, find out the reasons and quickly help to improve them, and provide a reliable basis for formulating next year's production plan.

    The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China organized five increased production and thrift inspection teams, which went to major factories, mines and enterprises such as the Ganzhou Tungsten Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine, Ganzhou, Ji'an and other cities, and the Shangrao Railway Branch on October 6 to assist in carrying out the increased production and thrift movement, and to understand the completion of tax revenue tasks and market changes in major towns. Before the inspection teams set off, Yang Shangkui, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out to them that the focus of this inspection work was to assist state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in carrying out the increased production and thrift movement. He asked each inspection team to carry out their work according to the specific situation. For units that have not yet carried out increased production and thrift mobilization and formulated plans, it is necessary to study the increased production and thrift tasks arranged by their direct leading organs, and help organize and mobilize the masses to formulate increased production and thrift plans; for units that have already formulated plans, help them check whether the plans have conservative and rash biases; for units that have already launched an increased production and thrift movement, check the progress of the movement and study good experiences and existing problems.
