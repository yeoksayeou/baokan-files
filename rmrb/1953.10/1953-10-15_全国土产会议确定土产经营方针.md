    National Native Products Conference Determines Native Products Management Policy

    [This newspaper dispatch] The National Native Products Conference convened in Beijing by the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government concluded on October 13th. This conference unified understanding of native product management, clarified the direction and policies for native product management in the future, and determined the tasks of native product companies. In addition, the conference summarized the basic situation of native product exchange over the past four years, proposed basic forms for carrying out native product exchange in the future, conducted exchanges within the native product company system, and determined the purchase and sales plan for the fourth quarter.

    The conference was summarized by Wang Lei, Vice Minister of Commerce of the Central People's Government. In his summary, he focused on explaining the current situation of the native products market. He said: The development of native product exchange in recent years has basically solved the sales problem of native products. At the same time, some native products have experienced supply shortages because production cannot keep up with the increasing rate of consumption. In addition, due to the relaxation of state-owned commercial departments' leadership over the market in native product management in the first half of the year, and insufficient integration of state-owned companies and cooperatives, some abnormal phenomena have appeared in the native product market. This is the speculative disruption of illegal private merchants, which affects the prices of native products. This is detrimental to both producers and consumers.

    After analyzing the native product market situation, he pointed out that in the current native product work, attention should be paid to mastering price policies, strengthening guidance on native product production, and appropriately encouraging increased production; state-owned companies should appropriately strengthen native product management and lead private merchants and control the market through practical business operations. He emphasized that state-owned commercial departments should strengthen the management of non-staple foods in large cities and industrial and mining areas, and the management of raw materials for native product industries, to meet the needs of the rising economic life of the people and the development of national economic construction. To do these tasks well, native product companies, cooperatives, and foreign trade departments must cooperate closely.

    Finally, based on the general spirit of increasing production and practicing economy of the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government, Wang Lei pointed out the key points of the work of the native product company system in the fourth quarter of 1953, and called on the cadres of the native product company system to strengthen business operations and work hard to complete the tasks under the unified leadership of the local party and government.

    全国土产会议确定土产经营方针
    【本报讯】中央人民政府商业部在京召开的全国土产会议，已在十月十三日闭幕。这次会议统一了对土产经营的认识，明确了今后土产经营的方针、政策，并决定了土产公司的任务。此外，会议还总结了四年来土产交流的基本情况，提出了今后开展土产交流的基本形式，进行了土产公司系统内部的交流，确定了第四季度的购销计划。
    会议由中央人民政府商业部副部长王磊作总结。他在总结中着重说明了目前土产市场的情况。他说：几年来土产交流的开展，已基本上解决了土产的销路问题，同时有些土产因生产赶不上消费增加的速度，出现了供不应求的情况。另外，由于上半年国营商业部门在土产经营中放松了对市场的领导，和国营公司与合作社结合的还不够，因而在土产市场上出现了某些不正常现象，这就是不法私商的投机捣乱，影响了土产市场价格。这对生产者和消费者都是不利的。
    他在分析了土产市场情况后，指出在目前土产工作中应重视价格政策的掌握，加强土产生产指导，适当地鼓励增加生产；国营公司应适当加强土产经营，通过实际业务经营来领导私商，掌握市场。他强调指出：国营商业部门应加强大城市、工矿区的副食品的经营和土产工业原料的经营，以适应人民经济生活上升和国家经济建设发展的需要。要作好这些工作，土产公司和合作社、对外贸易部门必须密切配合。
    王磊最后根据中央人民政府商业部总的增产节约的精神，指出了土产公司系统一九五三年第四季度的工作要点，并号召土产公司系统干部在当地党和政府的统一领导下加强业务经营，努力工作，完成任务。
