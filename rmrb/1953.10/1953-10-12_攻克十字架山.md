Conquering Cross Hill
    Lian Yunshan
    In June of this year, precisely when the Syngman Rhee clique was desperately clamoring to continue the war, even to "fight alone to the Yalu River and unify Korea," our Volunteer Army on the Kimcheng front launched a powerful attack on the Syngman Rhee's so-called "impregnable Gyeonggi Fortress" - Cross Hill position. In less than an hour, it was completely captured, and all the defending enemies were annihilated. Ren Zhiming, the platoon leader of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army who captured the main peak of Cross Hill, recently returned to the capital to visit the National Day celebration ceremony.
    At the Sand Table
    One day in June, Ren Zhiming and his company commanders were summoned to the group's command post bunker to listen quietly to the commander relay the combat orders. Those who came to listen to the orders with them were not only infantry but also artillery and tank unit commanders. Regiment Commander Gao Fengyi stood in front of a combat map and said:
    "For the sake of peace, we must severely punish the Syngman Rhee bandit gang who refuse to cease fire and constantly provoke our army, and launch a powerful attack on the important position of the Rhee puppet army—seizing Cross Hill." The regimental commander pointed to the map with a small stick. There were more than a dozen red arrows on the map, all pointing to Cross Hill. Among them, the largest arrow was to penetrate 100 meters into the enemy's depth while capturing other positions, tear open the enemy's defense system, and take the main peak directly. This task was very important. The regimental commander said: "Only by capturing the main peak can the remaining newly occupied positions be ensured." The task of capturing this main peak was undertaken by the fifth company where Ren Zhiming was, and the fifth company's assault platoon was Ren Zhiming's second platoon.
    Cross Hill consists of more than a dozen hills. The enemy has built pillboxes, bunkers, and tunnels on this hill, arranged a tight fire network, and deployed what they consider to be elite defensive forces. Syngman Rhee regards it as an "impregnable Gyeonggi Fortress." The entire terrain and the enemy's troop and firepower deployment were displayed on a large sand table. Regiment Commander Gao Fengyi pointed to the sand table and explained the combat plan in detail to everyone.
    Capturing the Main Peak
    At 8:50 PM on the 12th, platoon leader Ren Zhiming led the entire platoon in concealed preparation for the charge. He looked at his watch from time to time, waiting for that moment to arrive. The soldiers kept asking in a low voice, "Platoon leader, is it time yet?" The second hand ticked, and he excitedly but softly replied: "Soon! Get ready! Comrades! Remember the battle plan, remember to follow our artillery fire." The soldiers also replied softly: "Don't worry, we will definitely advance according to the infantry-artillery coordination regulations and will not lose the battle opportunity."
    Ren Zhiming looked at his watch, the second hand was ticking, two minutes away from nine o'clock, "Prepare—" Ren Zhiming softly gave the order, and the soldiers all propped up their bodies with one arm, raised their heads, and stared at the mouth of the ditch. It was a deep ditch that was eight hundred meters long, and the enemy's artillery fire on the mountains on both sides could weave a dense fire network on this ditch. Ren Zhiming and the others had to pass through this ditch to take the main peak directly.
    At exactly nine o'clock, the first artillery barrage of our army began! Suddenly, powerful artillery fire tended towards the enemy like an overwhelming force. Red light covered Cross Hill, and the sound of explosions shook the mountains. "Comrades! The artillery has opened the way for us! Advance!" Ren Zhiming led his troops into the mouth of the ditch. At this time, the enemy's artillery desperately fired over, blocking the mouth of the ditch. Ren Zhiming issued an order to advance rapidly, and the soldiers quickly passed through the mouth of the ditch.
    They advanced. On both sides were fire walls built by our artillery fire, and in front was the road opened by our platoon artillery. The artillery fire was shifting. Ren Zhiming led his troops through the smoke screen of artillery fire and advanced rapidly.
    The fifth company reached the charging starting point. As the signal rose, the artillerymen turned their artillery muzzles towards the main peak of Cross Hill, where a strong explosion immediately sounded. Tank gunners accurately threw armor-piercing shells into the enemy's bunkers. The enemy's barbed wire was blown away by our army's artillery fire and its own landmines, the bunkers collapsed, the trenches were blocked, and all the ground works were destroyed. Ren Zhiming looked at his watch. The charging time had arrived. Now was the time when our army's artillery fire could exert its maximum power, and it was also an excellent time to launch a charge to capture the enemy's position, but why didn't the company commander send out the charging signal? The scheduled charging time had arrived, why didn't he send the signal!
    In the regimental command post, the regimental commander held the telephone and asked, "Why?" The wireless telephone operator called the fifth company in code: "Please answer! Please answer!" Someone in the command post suggested: If the enemy had counterattacked, immediately order the artillery to fire at that area to eliminate the enemies exposed on the ground, so as to organize another charge and capture the main peak.
    At the artillery position, the artillery group was waiting for this signal. Without this signal, the artillery fire could not extend its range.
    In the tank, the gunners were waiting for this signal.
    At the charging starting point, all the soldiers of the company were also preparing to charge, waiting only for the signal to rise, but they could not see the signal. Our army's artillery fire continued to bombard the front, and the enemy's artillery fire was also approaching here step by step. The most precious thing now was time. If they were slightly delayed, the enemy's shells would land here, and the assault team's attack would be frustrated. Ren Zhiming was very anxious. "Why doesn't the company commander send out the charging signal?" He looked back at the road they had come from, where the enemy's artillery fire was. "The company commander may be injured." Ren Zhiming was sure of his judgment. He thought:
    "I am a Communist Party member and must be responsible for the victory of the battle." So he said to signalman Tan Changmo: "Now I, on behalf of the company commander, order you to send out the charging signal."
    The distinct signal rose! The artillery fire extended! "Multi-pronged attack, charge—" Ren Zhiming issued the order, and the soldiers rushed to the main peak.
    Flag bearer Chen Renhua was the first to rush to the top of the mountain. He found that an enemy anti-aircraft machine gun was firing signal flares into the air, trying to call fire to bombard the main peak. Chen Renhua threw a grenade into the firing port, and the machine gun was immediately silenced. Then, he planted the red flag on the main peak. He shouted loudly: "Comrades! Come up quickly! I'm here!" At this time, squad leader Liu Tongzheng was sweeping at the enemies in the tunnel with a submachine gun when suddenly both his arms were injured, and the submachine gun fell to the ground from his hand. He endured the pain, took out a grenade, bit off the safety pin with his teeth, and kicked the ignited grenade towards the enemy group with his foot. The grenade exploded immediately. Suddenly, in front of Ren Zhiming, a heavy machine gun extended out from a collapsed bunker and began to fire outwards. He immediately called for the recoilless gunner to fire, and it was destroyed with one shot. Most of the bunkers and tunnels on the enemy's position were destroyed. At this time, Ren Zhiming commanded the troops to search for the remaining enemies. Soldiers Gao Youcheng and Gong Youjia, in front of a remaining enemy bunker, shone a flashlight inside. There were four or five enemies huddled together. When the enemies saw the white light of the flashlight, they were so frightened that they closed their eyes tightly and desperately shrunk to the base of the wall. Gao Youcheng threw in a grenade, and Gong Youjia swept a magazine of bullets, and the bunker was eliminated. On the left flank position, Deng Gaoming's team was also eliminating the enemies in the last tunnel. One of them shone a flashlight inside, one threw grenades inside, and the other fired with a submachine gun. As a result, all the enemies in this tunnel were annihilated.
    The Signal of Victory
    At this time, messengers from various places came to report to the assault platoon leader Ren Zhiming that the position had been completely occupied. Signalman Tan Changmo was about to send a signal, but Ren Zhiming immediately stopped him and said: "Wait, tell each squad to search carefully again." Ten minutes later, the messenger came to report: "All areas have been searched, and the enemies have been completely wiped out." The signalman asked the platoon leader: "Can I send the signal now?" Ren Zhiming said: "Wait a minute, tell all squads to enter the tunnel and prepare to fight against the enemy's counterattack." After the troops all entered the tunnel and Ren Zhiming completed the inspection, he said: "Okay! You can send the signal now."
    Three red signal flares slowly rose into the high sky. This was the signal of victory.
    The tankmen, with the joy of victory, drove the tanks to the concealed area with a rumble...
    The artillerymen, seeing the signal, clapped their hands and shouted: "We have taken the main peak!"
    In the regimental command post, the regimental commander looked at the signal and calculated the time. It took only forty-eight minutes from the launch of the attack to the capture of the main peak. A smile appeared on his face.
    After midnight, the main peak of Cross Hill had become our army's rear, because the attacking troops on all routes had penetrated further forward and had completely won.
    Cross Hill, which was regarded as the "Gyeonggi Fortress" by the American aggressors and Syngman Rhee, was captured by us! Two years ago, Van Fleet had concentrated the general reserve of the US military artillery in Korea and launched the so-called "Autumn Offensive" against this small area including Cross Hill. They spent seventy-three days and lost 37,000 troops before occupying this mountain. At that time, Ren Zhiming and his comrades voluntarily withdrew after killing a large number of enemies. However, two years later, Ren Zhiming and his comrades took back this mountain in just forty-eight minutes. The victory of our army in capturing Cross Hill opened the prelude to the powerful Kimcheng counterattack.

    攻克十字架山
    连云山
    今年六月间，正是李承晚集团拚命叫喊着要继续战争，甚至要“单独打到鸭绿江，统一朝鲜”的时候，金城前线我志愿军对李承晚的所谓“不可攻克的京畿堡垒”——十字架山阵地发起了强大的攻击，不到一个小时，就全部攻占了这一高地，守敌全被歼灭。攻克十字架山主峰的志愿军某部排长任志明，不久前已回到首都参观了国庆节庆祝典礼。
    在沙盘跟前
    六月某天，任志明和他的连首长们奉召来到团指挥所的掩蔽部里，静听团长传达作战命令。和他们一起来听命令的不单是步兵，还有炮兵和战车部队的指挥员。团长高凤一站在一幅作战地图跟前说：
    “为了和平，我们必须给拒绝停战、不断对我军挑衅的李承晚匪帮以严厉的惩罚，对李伪军的重要阵地发起强大攻击——夺取十字架山。”团长用一根小棍指着地图，地图上有十几个红色箭头，指向十字架山，其中有一个最大的箭头，是要在攻占其他阵地的同时，插入敌人百公尺的纵深，撕开敌人的防御体系，直取主峰。这个任务非常重要，团长说：“只有夺取主峰，其余的新占阵地才能确保。”攻占这座主峰的任务，就是由任志明所在的五连担任，五连的突击排就是任志明的二排。
    十字架山是由十几个山头组成的，敌人在这个山上构筑了明碉暗堡和坑道，布置了严密的火网，配置了他们认为精锐的守备力量，李承晚把它看成是“不可攻克的京畿堡垒”，这座山的整个地形实况和敌人兵力火力的布置，都摆在一个大沙盘上，高凤一团长指着沙盘向大家详细地讲解了作战方案。
    夺取主峰
    十二日下午八时五十分，排长任志明率领着全排隐蔽地准备冲锋。他不时地看着手表，等待着那个时刻的到来，战士们不断地低声问：“排长，到了吗？”秒针“咭咭”地跳，他兴奋地但却轻声地回答说：“快啦！准备好！同志们！记住战斗方案，记住跟着咱们的炮火前进。”战士们也轻声地回答：“放心，我们一定按步炮协同规定前进，不会丧失战机。”
    任志明看着手表，秒针在跳，差两分钟就到九点，“准备——”任志明轻声地传下命令，战士们都用一只臂支起身体，高昂着头，注视着沟口，那是条长达八百公尺的深沟，两边山上敌人的炮火可以在这条沟上织成密密的火网。任志明他们要穿过这条沟直取主峰。
    九时正，我军第一次炮火急袭开始了！骤然间，强大的炮火排山倒海似地倾向敌军，红光罩住了十字架山，爆炸声震的山摇地动。“同志们！炮兵给我们打开了道路！前进！”任志明率领着部队插进沟口，这时，敌人的炮火拼命地打过来，封锁沟口。任志明发出疾速前进的命令，战士们迅速地通过了沟口。
    他们前进着。两边是我炮火筑成的火墙，前面是我们的排炮开辟的道路。炮火推移着。任志明率领部队在炮火的烟幕中穿过，飞速前进。
    五连到达了冲锋出发地，随着讯号的升起炮兵们把炮口转向十字架山的主峰，那里立刻响起了一片强烈的爆炸声。坦克炮手们把穿甲弹准确地投入敌堡里，敌人的铁丝网被我军炮火和它自己埋设的地雷炸飞了，暗堡坍塌了，盖沟堵塞了，所有的地面工事都毁坏了，任志明看着手表，冲锋时间到了，现在正是我军炮火发挥最大威力的时候，也是发起冲锋攻占敌人阵地的绝好时机，但是怎么不见连指挥员打出冲锋讯号呢？预定的冲锋时间已经到了，为什么不发讯号呢！
    在团指挥所里，团长握着电话机问着“为什么？”无线电话员用暗语呼叫五连：“请回答！请回答！”指挥所里有人建议：如果是敌人已反扑下来，就立刻命令炮兵向那里射击，以消灭暴露在地面上的敌人，以便再次组织冲锋，夺取主峰。
    在炮兵阵地上，炮兵群等待这个讯号，没有这个讯号炮火是不能延伸射击的。
    在坦克车上，炮手们等待着这个讯号。
    在冲锋出发地，全连的战士们也正准备着冲锋，只等讯号升起，但是看不见讯号。我军的炮火还向前面继续轰击，敌人的炮火也正向这里步步逼进，现在最宝贵的是时间。假如稍微迟缓，敌人的炮弹落在这里，突击队的攻击就会受挫。任志明非常焦急。“连指挥员为什么不发冲锋讯号呢？”他回头向来路望去，来路上是敌人的炮火。“连指挥员可能负伤了。”任志明肯定了自己的判断。他想：
    “我是共产党员，必须对战斗胜利负责。”于是他对讯号员谭长模说：“现在我代表连长命令你，发起冲锋讯号。”
    鲜明的讯号升起了！炮火延伸了！“多路攻击，冲锋——”任志明下达了命令，战士们冲上了主峰。
    红旗手陈仁华最先冲上山顶，他发现敌人的一挺高射机枪正对空发射讯号弹，企图呼唤火力向主峰轰击。陈仁华从射口投进一个手雷，这挺机枪立刻被打哑了；接着，他就把红旗插上了主峰。他大声喊着说：“同志们！快上来吧！我在这儿哪！”这时，班长刘同正端着冲锋枪向坑道里的敌人扫射，忽然两臂负伤了，冲锋枪一下子从手里落到地上，他忍痛拿出手榴弹，用牙咬出弦来，用脚把发了火的手榴弹踢向敌群，手榴弹立刻爆炸了。忽然在任志明跟前的一个打塌的地堡里，伸出一挺重机枪向外扫射；他立刻叫无座力炮手发射，一炮就把它摧毁了。敌人阵地上的地堡和坑道，大部被摧垮了，这时任志明就指挥部队搜索残敌。战士高有成和弓有嘉两人，在一个残余敌堡跟前，用手电筒朝里一照，里面有四、五个敌人缩在一起，敌人看见手电的白光，骇得紧闭起眼睛拚命地往墙根下缩，高有成打进一个手雷，弓有嘉扫了一盘子弹，这个地堡就被解决了。左侧阵地上，邓高明小组也正在解决最后一条坑道里的敌人。他们一个拿手电灯往里照，一个往里投手雷，另一个用冲锋枪扫射。结果，把这条坑道里的敌人全部歼灭了。
    胜利的讯号
    这时，各处通讯员前来向突击排长任志明报告说，阵地已全部占领。讯号员谭长模就要发出讯号，任志明立刻制止他说：“慢着，叫各班再仔细搜索。”十分钟后，通讯员来报告：“各处已搜索完毕，敌人已全部肃清。”讯号员问排长：“可以发出讯号了吧？”任志明说：“等一等，叫各班全部进入坑道，准备打敌人的反扑。”当部队全部进入坑道，任志明检查完毕之后才说：“好！可以发讯号了。”
    三颗红色讯号弹缓缓地向高空升起，这是胜利的讯号。
    战车手们带着胜利的喜悦，驾着坦克往隐蔽地轰轰开动……
    炮兵们看着这讯号，拍手大叫：“我们打下主峰了！”
    在团指挥所里，团长看了讯号，计算了一下时间，从发起攻击到攻占主峰，一共只用了四十八分钟。他脸上现着微笑。
    午夜以后，十字架山主峰已经成为我军的后方了，因为各路攻击部队已向前插得更远并已完全获胜。
    被美国侵略者和李承晚看成是“京畿堡垒”的十字架山被我们攻占了！两年前，范佛里特曾经集中了在朝鲜的美军炮兵总预备队向这个包括十字架山在内的小小地区，发动了所谓“秋季攻势”，它们花费了七十三天的时间，丧失了三万七千人的兵力，才占去了这座山，那时任志明和他的战友们在大量杀伤敌人后才主动地撤离出去。然而，两年以后，任志明和他的战友们只用了四十八分钟的时间，就把这座山拿了回来。我军攻克十字架山的胜利，给强大的金城反击战揭开了序幕。
