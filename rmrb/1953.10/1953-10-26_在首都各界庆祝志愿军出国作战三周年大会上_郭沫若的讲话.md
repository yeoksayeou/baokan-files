Comrades,

Today, the people of the whole country are celebrating the third anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the Korean War with joy and excitement.

Three years ago, the aggressive flames of the American imperialists invading the Democratic People's Republic of Korea seriously threatened the security of our motherland and world peace. The Chinese People's Volunteers timely raised the banner of "Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Protecting Our Homes and Defending the Country," and crossed the Yalu River valiantly and spiritedly. Together with the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army, they quickly reversed the military situation in Korea, driving the American aggressors from the Yalu River back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, where they began their war of aggression. In the three years and one month since then, according to the U.S. Department of Defense itself, the American aggressors and their puppet states suffered more than 1.47 million casualties. The direct war expenditure consumed by the American aggressors was over 20 billion U.S. dollars. It was precisely such a huge defeat that forced the American aggressors to accept armistice negotiations. On July 27th of this year, the Korean Armistice Agreement was finally signed. This is a great victory for the Korean people and the Chinese people. This is a great victory for the entire peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world.

The people of China and Korea have consistently advocated a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. Now we must also strive for the thorough implementation of the armistice agreement, which is the beginning of a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. This great historical beginning was won by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army with their lives and blood. The people of China and Korea recognize the righteousness of fighting for their motherland and for world peace, and this is the fundamental source of our victory. Our successive military victories exposed the outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature of the American imperialists, proving that imperialist aggression must be defeated and can be completely defeated. In the course of the war, the internal contradictions of the imperialist camp have expanded and sharpened. The international position of the American aggressors has become increasingly isolated.

The history of the Korean War proves that the Korean people are invincible, and the friendly unity between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China is unbreakable.

The history of the Korean War also proves that the People's Republic of China has become a powerful stabilizing factor in Asia and the Pacific region, and has become a powerful force for the oppressed people of the East to strive for freedom and independence. The era in which imperialists could肆行侵略肆行侵略 and enslave the people of various Eastern countries has passed.

The peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is even more consolidated. The people of the world unanimously demand the easing of international tensions, and are rejoicing in the victory of peace won by the people of China and Korea. They are waging struggles to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and to strive for an agreement among the five major powers to resolve the current international disputes.

Today, as we celebrate this anniversary, we extend our heartfelt congratulations and high respect to the heroic Korean people, the Korean People's Army, and the brave Chinese People's Volunteers.

We thank the heroic sons and daughters of the Chinese people for their victory, which has ensured the independence and security of the motherland and the happy life of the people. In the past three years, all the great achievements of our motherland in politics and economy have been inseparable from the great struggle of Resisting America and Aiding Korea. The people of our country have received profound patriotic education in the Resisting America and Aiding Korea movement. In their respective posts, they have worked hard to serve national construction, taking the Volunteers as an example. Production enthusiasm has generally increased, and the people's democratic regime has become more consolidated. Therefore, far beyond the expectations of American imperialism, our motherland has become increasingly strong in the arduous struggle to repel the crazy aggression of American imperialism.

Comrades, from the day the People's Republic of China was founded, the people of our country and our government have faced a great historical task. This is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. Such a general line is to gradually transition our motherland to an infinitely bright and infinitely happy socialist society. The basic law that guides and governs the entire social economy of our country is to continuously develop production and, on the basis of developing production, to gradually meet the growing material and cultural needs of all the people. This determines the fundamental position of the people of our country and our government in resolutely safeguarding peace in dealing with all international issues.

Precisely because of this, the people of our country and our government have consistently advocated resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation. We sincerely hope for the long-term preservation of world peace and the rapid restoration of normal relations between countries. From the beginning of the Korean War, we have resolutely advocated a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue and have unswervingly struggled to realize this proposition, so that the difficult and complex Korean armistice negotiations finally achieved success.

After the Korean armistice was realized, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, together, are continuing to strictly abide by and implement all the provisions of the armistice agreement in order to ensure the thorough implementation of the armistice agreement. The people and governments of China and Korea, and the people and governments of the peace and democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union, are continuing to work tirelessly to promote the smooth convening of the political conference, in order to further seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue.

However, the US government has other ideas.

Comrades, here is a fundamental difference, that is, the basic laws that govern the entire social economy of the United States are completely different from ours. That basic law is to guarantee the maximum amount of capitalist profits by exploiting the vast majority of its own people and bankrupting and impoverishing them, by enslaving and constantly plundering the people of other countries, especially the people of backward countries, and by means of war and the militarization of the national economy aimed at guaranteeing the highest profits. The real masters of the United States are a handful of monopoly capitalists. At present, they are mainly relying on creating international tensions and continuing to expand their military and prepare for war in order to obtain excess profits. Therefore, easing international tensions is exactly the opposite of their demands. Although their world aggression policy has suffered a setback in the Korean War, they do not want to give up. They continue to implement a policy of international provocation that maintains international tensions. Precisely for this reason, the U.S. government has been unwilling to have an armistice in Korea. After the armistice was achieved, it has stubbornly used its consistent shameless tricks to carry out various obstructions and sabotages.

Comrades, you should also remember that on the eve of the signing of the armistice agreement, the American imperialists had already connived with the Syngman Rhee gang to use force to take away more than 27,000 of our captured personnel, which has not yet been accounted for. After the signing of the armistice agreement, there were still 76,140 of our captured personnel who have not yet been repatriated, nor have they been handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody. When the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission exercised its functions, the American aggressors interfered and obstructed them, causing repeated delays in the explanation work.

What kind of tricks did the American aggressors use to interfere with and obstruct the explanation work? They sent a large number of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gang agents in advance, posing as our captured personnel, carrying bayonets from American carbines, flagpoles fitted with spearheads, wooden sticks, crutches, axes, saws, military German Shepherds, etc., and mixed into the prisoner-of-war camp area. These armed agents carried out a reign of terror against the DPRK and Chinese captured personnel who were not directly repatriated in the POW camps. They were organized, with so-called "battalion commanders," "company commanders," "platoon commanders," "core groups," and armed "guards." They exercised barbaric control over the prisoners, using torture and killing to threaten the captured personnel not to apply for repatriation and not to listen to explanations. The bloody atrocities of these agents brutally beating and killing prisoners of war in the POW camps have occurred repeatedly.

Another equally despicable trick is that the American aggressors sent Kuomintang agents who had long persecuted our captured personnel in American POW camps to serve as American representatives and translators. Inside the explanation tents, they openly violated many provisions of the "Terms of Reference" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work." They carried out open and direct interference in the explanation work in order to threaten our captured personnel and prevent them from applying for repatriation.

In this way, no more than two days after the start of the explanation work, it was stalled due to the obstruction and sabotage of the US side.

The American aggressors not only used violent threats against our captured personnel, but also used violent threats against the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The American aggressors instructed the Chiang and Rhee gang agents they hired to use violence to prevent the Indian custodial troops from entering the POW camps and arrested Indian officers. At the same time, they even instructed Syngman Rhee to clamor for the use of force to resolve the Indian custodial troops. Recently, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has been paralyzed under the direct and indirect obstruction and sabotage of the United States, and the Korean armistice and the entire cause of peace have been seriously threatened.

Secondly, the American aggressors are also trying to obstruct and sabotage the political conference that is about to be held in every possible way.

The ink on the Korean Armistice Agreement was not yet dry when U.S. Secretary of State Dulles signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Syngman Rhee gang on August 8th, stipulating that the United States has the right to station troops indefinitely in South Korea. Moreover, the U.S. government and Syngman Rhee also stated at the same time that if the political conference does not achieve their predetermined goals, they will withdraw from the political conference together three months after the political conference is convened.

The U.S. government once coerced the other fifteen countries participating in the Korean War to issue a so-called "Sixteen-Nation Declaration" with him, publicly declaring that it would resume the Korean War and make it not limited to the Korean territory. It attempted to threaten the people of Korea and China and the people of the world with such arrogant clamor.

At the 7th and 8th sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, the U.S. government continued to manipulate its voting machine and used extremely tyrannical means to exclude India and other neutral countries concerned about Korean peace from participating in the political conference, while passing the so-called fifteen-nation proposal on the composition of the political conference, which was entirely manipulated by it, attempting to make the political conference a meeting full of gunpowder, with no peaceful atmosphere, and only the two sides of the armistice participating, so as to facilitate the implementation of its conspiracy to manipulate and sabotage the political conference.

Comrades! The situation is very clear before us. The various provocative acts of the enemies of peace tell us that we must raise our vigilance and strengthen our preparations a hundredfold. Therefore, today, as we commemorate the third anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the Korean War, the people of our country must strengthen our determination even more: we must continue to struggle to the end for the final victory of the struggle to Resist America and Aid Korea. We have already defeated the enemy's aggression together with the Korean people. We must also be prepared to smash any new provocations by the enemy and help the Korean people restore the wounds of war. We must vigorously increase production and practice thrift, on the one hand, do our best to support the Chinese People's Volunteers to ensure that the Korean Armistice Agreement is not destroyed and strive for a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue; on the other hand, strengthen our national construction, strengthen our national defense forces, and strengthen our forces to oppose aggression and defend peace. This is the lofty task of the people of our country today.

Long live the Chinese People's Volunteers!

Long live the militant friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!

Long live the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

    在首都各界庆祝志愿军出国作战三周年大会上
    郭沫若的讲话同志们：
    今天全国人民都怀着欢欣鼓舞的心情庆祝中国人民志愿军出国作战三周年纪念日。
    三年前，美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的凶焰，严重地威胁到我们祖国的安全与世界和平。中国人民志愿军及时地高举起“抗美援朝保家卫国”的旗帜，雄赳赳、气昂昂地跨过鸭绿江，和英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军一起，迅速地扭转了朝鲜的军事局势，把美国侵略者从鸭绿江边赶回到它开始发动侵略战争的三八线附近。美国侵略者及其仆从国家在三年另一个月多的时间内，据美国国防部自己承认：死伤了兵员一百四十七万多人。美国侵略者所消耗的直接战费在二百亿美元以上。正是这样巨大的失败，迫使美国侵略者不得不接受停战谈判。在今年七月二十七日，朝鲜停战协定终于签订了。这是朝鲜人民和中国人民的伟大胜利。这是以苏联为首的整个和平民主阵营和全世界爱好和平人民的伟大胜利。
    中朝两国人民是一贯主张朝鲜问题的和平解决的。现在我们还须努力争取彻底实施的停战协定，就是和平解决朝鲜问题的开端，这一具有历史意义的伟大开端是由中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军用生命和鲜血所争取得来的。中朝两国人民认识到为祖国而战、为世界和平而战的正义性，这就是我们的胜利的基本源泉。我们的接连的军事胜利揭露了美帝国主义者外强中干的本质，证明了帝国主义的侵略是必须击败，而且完全能够击败的。在战争进行中，帝国主义阵营的内部矛盾日益扩大了起来，尖锐了起来。美国侵略者的国际地位是日益陷于孤立了。
    朝鲜战争的历史证明：朝鲜人民是不可战胜的，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、苏联和中华人民共和国之间的友好团结是牢不可破的。
    朝鲜战争的历史又证明：中华人民共和国已经成为亚洲和太平洋区域的强大的稳定因素，已经成为东方被压迫人民争取自由和独立的强大力量。帝国主义者能够肆行侵略和奴役东方各国人民的时代已经过去了。
    以苏联为首的和平民主阵营是更加巩固了。世界人民一致要求缓和国际紧张局势，正为中朝人民所赢得的和平胜利而欢欣鼓舞，正为争取和平解决朝鲜问题，争取五大国协议以解决目前国际争端而展开斗争。
    今天，我们庆祝这个纪念日，我们谨向英雄的朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军和英勇的中国人民志愿军，表示衷心的祝贺和崇高的敬意。
    我们感谢中国人民的英雄儿女所取得的胜利，保障了祖国的独立安全和人民的幸福生活。三年来，我们祖国在政治经济上的一切伟大成就都是和抗美援朝的伟大斗争分不开的。我国人民在抗美援朝运动中受到了深刻的爱国主义教育，在各个岗位上都以志愿军为榜样努力为国家建设服务，生产热情普遍地提高了，人民民主政权更加巩固了，因此远出于美帝国主义的意料之外，我们的祖国就在击退美帝国主义疯狂侵略的艰苦奋斗中已经日益强大了起来。
    同志们，自从中华人民共和国成立的一天起，我国人民和我国政府就面临着一个伟大的历史任务。这就是要逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，和逐步实现对农业、手工业、私营工商业的社会主义改造。这样的一条总路线，是要使我们的祖国逐步过渡到无限光明、无限幸福的社会主义社会。指导着和支配着我国整个社会经济的基本法则，是要不断地发展生产，在发展生产的基础上，来逐步满足全体人民日益增长的物质和文化的需要。这就决定了我国人民和我国政府在对待一切国际问题方面的坚决维护和平的根本立场。
    正因为这样，我国人民和我国政府是一贯主张以和平协商的方式解决国际争端的。我们衷心热望世界和平的长远保持和国际间正常关系的迅速恢复。从朝鲜战争一开始，我们就坚决主张和平解决朝鲜问题，并且坚持不渝地为实现这一个主张而不懈地斗争，使困难而复杂的朝鲜停战谈判终于获得了成功。
    朝鲜停战实现之后，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一道，正继续严格遵守并履行停战协定的一切规定，以保障停战协定的彻底实施。中朝两国的人民和政府，以苏联为首的和平民主国家的人民和政府，都在继续不懈地为促成政治会议的顺利召开而努力，以便进一步谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    但是，美国政府却有另一种想法。
    同志们，在这里是有一个基本上的不同，那就是支配着美国整个社会经济的基本法则，和我们完全两样。那个基本法则，是用剥削本国最大多数人民并使他们破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断夺掠其他国家人民、特别是落后国家人民的办法，以及用旨在保证最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大限度的资本主义的利润。美国的真正主人，就是一小撮的垄断资本家。在目前，他们主要是靠着制造国际紧张局势，继续扩军备战，来取得超额利润的。因此，要使国际紧张局势缓和，是和他们的要求恰恰相反的。他们的世界侵略政策虽然在侵朝战争中遭受了挫败，但是他们并不想放弃。他们继续执行着使国际局势维持着紧张状态的国际挑衅政策。正因为这样，所以美国政府一直不愿意在朝鲜停战，在停战实现之后，也一直顽梗不化地使用一贯的无耻伎俩，进行种种的阻挠和破坏。
    同志们，你们还应该记得，在遣返战俘问题上，美帝国主义者在停战协定签订的前夜就已经纵容了李承晚匪帮用武力押走我方被俘人员二万七千余名，至今未作交代。停战协定签订后，也还有我方被俘人员七万六千一百四十名，至今未被遣返，也未交给中立国遣返委员会看管。在中立国遣返委员会行使职权时，美国侵略者又横加干涉和阻挠，造成解释工作的一再拖延。
    美国侵略者对于解释工作的干涉和阻挠是使用着怎样的伎俩呢？他预先派遣大批蒋介石和李承晚匪帮特务，冒充我方被俘人员，带着美国卡宾枪的刺刀、装上矛头的旗竿、木棒、拐杖、斧头、锯子、军用狼狗等等混入战俘看管地区。这些武装特务，在战俘营中，对不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员实行恐怖统治，他们是有组织的，有所谓“大队长”、“中队长”、“小队长”、“核心组”和武装“警备队”，他们对战俘施行野蛮控制，用酷刑和残杀来威胁被俘人员不得申请遣返，并不准听取解释。这些特务分子们在战俘营中凶殴和残杀战俘的血腥暴行已经是一再发生了。
    还有同样卑鄙的伎俩是，美国侵略者把长期在美方战俘营中迫害我方被俘人员的国民党特务派充美方的代表和翻译员，在解释帐篷内，公然破坏“职权范围”与“解释和访问工作细则”的许多规定。他们对解释工作进行公开的和直接的干扰，用以威胁    我方被俘人员，使他们不敢申请遣返。
    就这样，解释工作开始之后不两天，便由于美方的阻挠和破坏，已经陷于停顿。
    美国侵略者对我方被俘人员既施行暴力威胁，对中立国遣返委员会也同样施行暴力威胁。美国侵略者指使他所雇佣的蒋、李匪帮的特务们用暴力阻止印度看管部队进入战俘营，逮捕印度军官，同时，更指使李承晚叫嚣要用武力解决印度看管部队。到了最近，中立国遣返委员会竟在美国的直接间接的阻挠和破坏之下陷于瘫痪状态，朝鲜停战和整个和平事业受到了严重的威胁。
    其次是对于将要召开的政治会议，美国侵略者也是千方百计地进行阻挠而企图破坏的。
    朝鲜停战协定签订的墨迹未干，美国国务卿杜勒斯就在八月八日和李承晚匪帮签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，规定着美国有权无限期地驻留军队在南朝鲜。而且美国政府和李承晚还同时声明：如果政治会议达不到他们预定的目的，他们就要在政治会议召开后满了三个月便一同退出政治会议。
    美国政府曾经胁迫参加侵朝战争的其他十五个国家和他一道发表过所谓“十六国宣言”，公开声明要重新恢复朝鲜战争并使之不限于朝鲜境内。它企图以这样狂妄的叫嚣来威胁朝中人民和世界人民。
    在第七届和第八届的联合国大会上，美国政府又继续操纵它的表决机器，以极端横暴的手段排斥印度及其他关心朝鲜和平的中立国家参加政治会议，而通过了由它一手包办的关于政治会议成员的所谓十五国提案，企图使政治会议成为一个充满火药味的、毫无和平气息的、只有停战双方参加的会议，以便于遂行其操纵和破坏政治会议的预谋。
    同志们！局势摆在我们的面前是很清楚的，和平敌人的种种挑衅行为，告诉我们必须百倍地提高警惕和加强戒备。因此，在今天我们纪念中国人民志愿军出国作战三周年的时候，我们全国人民就要更加坚定我们的决心：要为抗美援朝斗争的最后胜利而继续奋斗到底。我们已经和朝鲜人民一起打败了敌人的侵略，我们还要准备粉碎敌人的任何的新的挑衅，并帮助朝鲜人民恢复战争的创伤。我们要厉行增产节约，一面尽力支援中国人民志愿军，来保障朝鲜停战协定不被破坏、争取朝鲜问题的和平解决；一面加强我们的国家建设，加强我国的国防力量，加强我国反对侵略保卫和平的力量。这就是我国人民今天的崇高任务。
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    中朝人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的和平民主阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
