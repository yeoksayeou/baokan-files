Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 17th dispatch: The Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, in its morning session on the 15th, heard a report from the President of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Di Vittorio, on "The tasks of trade unions in capitalist and colonial countries in striving for economic and social development, and in defending national independence and democratic freedoms."

Di Vittorio cited numerous statistics to illustrate the general economic decline in capitalist and colonial countries, the fact that two-thirds of the world's people live in poverty, and that their lives are constantly deteriorating, with the middle class also becoming increasingly impoverished. This is due to the fact that, in order to obtain the maximum profit, monopoly capitalists are intensifying their exploitation of the working masses in their own countries and in the colonies, and plundering raw material resources. In many countries, unemployment has become a regular occurrence. Capitalists use this situation to keep workers under the constant threat of dismissal, forcing them to agree to reductions in wages and benefits. Real wages of workers are constantly decreasing, while the profits of big capitalists are constantly increasing.

Di Vittorio said that the demand to defend and improve the living standards of working people continues to be the foundation of the trade union struggle. However, this should be linked to broader work so that the working class can unite firmly with the peasants and the middle class, leading them in a common struggle against the policies of monopoly capital. Therefore, trade unions must counter the policies of monopoly capital with the economic policies of the working class, that is, by proposing a constructive policy that advocates productive investment, maintaining full employment, organized development of production, and increasing the purchasing power of the people, a policy that promotes the economic and social development of all countries, and opposes stagnation, regression, and poverty. This is the economic policy guideline that the Italian General Confederation of Labor formulated in 1949, and it has been genuinely welcomed by the Italian people.

Di Vittorio then spoke in detail about how the predatory policies of US imperialism have led to a serious economic crisis in the countries that have been Marshallized and in backward countries, with reduced exports and increased trade deficits. In this situation, it is the broad masses of the people who suffer the most. Therefore, it is necessary to unite people from all strata around the trade unions in various countries and on an international scale, with the goal of breaking free from imperialist plunder, in order to create the conditions for economic development in various countries, thereby raising the economic and cultural level of the people.

He talked about the struggles of the people of various countries for national independence. He said that this issue used to be faced only by colonial, semi-colonial, and backward countries, but today, highly developed capitalist countries such as Italy, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands are also facing this issue in another form. The same is true of Britain to some extent. Therefore, workers and trade unions in capitalist countries have new possibilities to form alliances with the broad masses of the people. In order for the struggle of trade unions to become national in scope, trade unions must support the demands of other social strata affected by the policies of monopoly capital. In colonial and semi-colonial countries, national independence is a major prerequisite for establishing new social relations and fundamentally revitalizing the economy. Therefore, the struggle for economic and social demands must be linked to the struggle for national independence. He pointed out that the struggle for national independence is a major aspect of the struggle for peace, and that trade unions should promote and lead national unity in these struggles.

Di Vittorio finally talked about the issue of protecting the democratic rights of workers in enterprises. He said that the governments of capitalist countries are intensifying their suppression of collective actions by workers to defend their vital interests. Therefore, the issue of protecting trade union rights is a major demand of the working people at present. He suggested: (1) The main slogan for the May Day festival in 1954 should be to defend the basic and inalienable rights of the working people; (2) The World Federation of Trade Unions should formulate a charter on the trade union rights and democratic rights of the working people of various countries, widely publicize it, and submit it to the United Nations and the International Labor Organization.

The afternoon session on the 15th began discussing Di Vittorio's report. The President of the Latin American Labor Confederation, Lombardo Toledano, described the struggle of the working people in Latin America. He said that at the Second Congress, only 21 delegates from Latin America participated, while this Congress has 160 delegates from 18 Latin American countries, almost half of whom are delegates sent by trade unions that have not yet joined the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Latin American Labor Confederation. He denounced the divisive activities of reactionary trade union leaders under the direction of the United States.

He finally talked about the various tasks of struggle facing the trade unions in Latin America.

The German delegate, Keller, described the struggle of the workers in West Germany. He called on the working people of the whole of Germany to unite to prevent the realization of the conspiracies of American and German imperialism.

The Vice-Chairman of the Stockholm Automobile Workers' Union in Sweden, T. Falk, said that the decision of the leaders of the Swedish Confederation of Trade Unions to withdraw from the World Federation of Trade Unions was not agreed to by the workers. Many local organizations have requested to rejoin the World Federation of Trade Unions. He supported the World Federation of Trade Unions' proposal to all trade unions that have not joined the World Federation of Trade Unions to take concerted action.

Pramanik, a member of the Presidium of the All-India Trade Union Congress, who attended the conference, spoke. He said that if the people of China and India unite with the people of the Soviet Union and the people of other democratic countries, as well as the oppressed people of all countries, there will be no force in the world that can plunge mankind into another terrible war. The people of the great Soviet Union and New China are doing everything possible to ease world tensions, end the Cold War, and promote world peace. He said that all working people should fully support this policy regardless of their political views. He called for the formation of a united front on a national and international scale to prevent a new war. In his speech, Pramanik expressed support for the recommendations on unity in Sayan's report.

Delegates from Venezuela, Guatemala and other countries also spoke at the afternoon meeting. Before the meeting adjourned, a statement from the Credentials Committee was read, reporting that the number of delegates and guests attending the conference had increased to 775.

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 17th dispatch: The head of the Chinese delegation to the Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Liu Ningyi, and the members of the delegation held a get-together on the 16th at the Vienna spa salon with the delegation of the Korean Trade Union and the delegation of the Vietnamese Trade Union attending the congress. The head of the Korean Trade Union delegation, Xu Hui, acting chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the Korean Vocational General League, and four members, and the head of the Vietnamese Trade Union delegation, Nguyen Cong Hoa, a standing member of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, and eleven members participated in the get-together.

The get-together was filled with an atmosphere of cordial, warm, and friendly feelings.

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 16th dispatch: The Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions showed the Chinese film "Chengdu-Chongqing Railway" on the evening of the 14th at the "Tabor" cinema in Vienna.

About 200 trade union delegates from various countries attending the conference went to watch it, and the audience repeatedly applauded enthusiastically during the screening.

    世界工会第三次代表大会继续开会
    维多里奥就第二项议程作报告
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：在世界工会第三次代表大会十五日上午会议上，世界工联主席维多里奥就“资本主义与殖民地国家内的工会在争取经济与社会发展、在维护民族独立与民主自由方面的任务”作了报告。
    维多里奥列举许多统计材料，说明资本主义和殖民地国家中经济普遍衰退，全世界三分之二的人民过着贫困的、并还在不断恶化的生活，中产阶级也日趋贫困。这是由于垄断资本家为了获得最大限度的利润，加紧对本国和殖民地劳动群众进行剥削，掠夺原料资源。在许多国家中，失业已经成为经常的情况。资本家就利用这种情况，使工人经常处于解雇的威胁下，迫使他们同意减少工资和救济金。工人实际工资在不断降低，而大资本家的利润却不断增加。
    维多里奥说，保卫并提高劳动人民生活水平的要求，继续是工会斗争的基础。但是这应该与更广泛的工作联系起来，以使工人阶级能与农民以及中产阶级牢固地团结起来，领导他们共同进行反对垄断资本的政策。因此，工会必须以工人阶级的经济政策，来反对垄断资本的政策，也就是提出一个主张生产性投资、维持充分就业、有组织地发展生产、提高人民的购买力的建设性政策，促成所有国家的经济与社会发展的政策，来反对停滞、退步与贫困的政策。这就是意大利总工会在一九四九年所制定的经济政策的方针，它受到意大利人民的真正欢迎。
    维多里奥随后详尽地谈到美帝国主义掠夺政策使马歇尔化各国及落后国家经济危机严重，出口减少，贸易逆差增加的情形。在这种情况下，首先受害的是广大人民。因此，必须为了摆脱帝国主义掠夺这样一个目标，而在各国以及国际规模上把各阶层的人民团结在工会周围，以创造各国经济发展的条件，从而提高人民的经济与文化水平。
    他谈到各国人民争取民族独立的斗争。他说，这个问题过去只是殖民地、半殖民地与落后国家所面临的问题，但是在今天，像意大利、法国、比利时、荷兰等高度发展的资本主义国家，也在另一种形式上面临着这个问题。英国在某种程度上说来也是一样。因此，资本主义国家的工人和工会便有与广大人民结成联盟的新的可能性。为了使工会的斗争成为全国性的，工会便必须支持受垄断资本政策影响的其他社会阶层的要求。在殖民地和半殖民地国家中，要建立新的社会关系，要根本地振兴经济，民族独立是一个主要的先决条件。因此，必须把经济与社会要求的斗争与民族独立斗争联系在一起。他指出，民族独立斗争是争取和平斗争中的一个主要方面，工会应提倡并领导在这些斗争中的全国团结一致。
    维多里奥最后谈到保卫工人在企业中的民主权利问题。他说，资本主义国家政府正在加紧镇压工人保卫切身权益的集体行动，因此保卫工会权利问题是劳动人民目前主要的要求。他建议：（一）一九五四年五一节主要口号定为保卫劳动人民的基本的和不可剥夺的权利；（二）世界工联制订一个关于各国劳动人民的工会权利和民主权利的宪章，加以广泛宣传，并将它提交联合国及国际劳工组织。
    十五日下午会议开始讨论维多里奥报告。拉丁美洲劳工联盟主席伦巴多·托列达诺在发言中叙述了拉丁美洲劳动人民的斗争情况。他说，第二次大会时拉丁美洲只有二十一个代表参加，这次大会有拉丁美洲十八个国家的一百六十个代表参加，其中差不多一半是还没有参加世界工联和拉丁美洲劳工联盟的工会所派出的代表。他指责了反动工会领袖在美国指示下进行的分裂活动。
    他最后谈到拉丁美洲工会所面临的各项斗争任务。
    德国代表凯勒叙述了西德工人的斗争情况。他号召全德国劳动人民团结起来阻止美国和德国帝国主义阴谋的实现。
    瑞典斯德哥尔摩汽车工人工会副主席特·法尔克说，瑞典总工会领导者当年决定退出世界工联，是没有得到工人们同意的。许多地方组织要求重新加入世界工联。他支持世界工联向所有没有参加世界工联的工会号召采取一致行动的建议。
    列席大会的全印总工会主席团委员普拉马尼克发言。他说，中国和印度人民与苏联人民和其他民主国家人民以及各国被压迫人民团结起来，世界上就再也没有一种势力可以使人类卷入另一次可怕战争的漩涡中去。伟大的苏联与新中国人民在尽一切力量缓和世界紧张局势、结束冷战和促进世界和平。他说，一切劳动人民都应该不分政治见解的不同而完全支持这个政策。他号召在全国与国际性的规模上结成统一战线，防止新战争。普拉马尼克在发言中表示支持赛扬报告中关于团结问题的建议。
    在下午会议上发言的还有委内瑞拉、危地马拉等国代表。会议结束前宣读了资格审查委员会的一项声明，报告出席大会的代表及来宾已增加到七百七十五人。
    【新华社维也纳十七日电】我国出席世界工会第三次代表大会代表团团长刘宁一和团员们十六日在维也纳疗养沙龙与出席大会的朝鲜工会代表团及越南工会代表团举行联欢会。朝鲜工会代表团团长、朝鲜职业总同盟中央常务委员会代理委员长徐辉和团员四人，越南工会代表团团长、越南总工会常务委员阮公和及团员十一人参加了联欢会。
    联欢会中充满了亲切热诚友好的气氛。
    【新华社维也纳十六日电】世界工会第三次代表大会十四日晚在维也纳“塔波尔”电影院放映我国影片“成渝铁路”。
    前往观看的有出席大会的各国工会代表约二百人，放映时观众一再热烈鼓掌。
