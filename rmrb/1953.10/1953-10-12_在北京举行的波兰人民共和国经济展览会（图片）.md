The Economic Exhibition of the People's Republic of Poland displays hundreds of various machines, including cranes, locomotives, various lathes, coal mining machines, pulp machines, trucks, agricultural machines, and sugar making machines. It also displays food, leather products, fashions, household goods, paper, and toys. These machines and light industrial products not only show the brilliant achievements of People's Poland over the past nine years, but also exemplify the happy life of the Polish people.

The Economic Exhibition of the People's Republic of Poland grandly opened on September 26 at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace. Deng Xiaoping, Vice Premier of the State Council of our Central People's Government, attended in person, delivered a speech on behalf of our Central People's Government, and after the ribbon-cutting ceremony, toured the various sections of the exhibition accompanied by Mr. Popiel, head of the government delegation of the Economic Exhibition of the People's Republic of Poland and Minister of Shipping of Poland. This is the scene of them viewing the hardness testing machine.

This is a model of the "Palace of Culture and Science named after Stalin" at the exhibition. This magnificent and grand building was begun according to the agreement signed by the Soviet and Polish governments. All the equipment needed for its entire construction project is supplied by the Soviet side, and the main part of the construction work is also undertaken by people sent by the Soviet side. It is a symbol of Soviet-Polish friendship.

The People's Republic of Poland ranks second in Europe in coal resources. After the Polish people gained power, modernization and mechanization have been gradually realized in the entire production process. This is the scene of demonstrating an electric coal cutting machine at the exhibition.

The sixty-six-ton double-column vertical lathe is the heaviest exhibit. It only occupies an area of about two square meters. A workpiece weighing twenty-five tons and with a diameter of three thousand six hundred millimeters can be placed on its cylinder. The entire machine is powered by seven motors and can be operated by just one person.

At the exhibition, this Polish technician is explaining the structure of a multi-tool automatic lathe to technicians from the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory who came to Beijing to visit.

This Polish technician is demonstrating a high-speed woodworking planer.

People's Poland can now manufacture tractors, seeders, and other agricultural machines on its own. There are now nearly 200,000 agricultural machines working on Polish farms. This Polish technician is demonstrating a universal tractor.

During the exhibition, the Beijing Company of China Department Store has specially set up a Polish goods sales point. Many spectators are purchasing fabrics, woolens, photographic paper, etc. from Poland with great interest.

The children are visiting the cultural hall of the exhibition. This nursery school teacher is pointing to a portrait hanging on the wall, explaining the story of the outstanding Polish astronomer Copernicus to the children.

The shipping industry of the Polish people is developing. The "Huta" ship, later renamed "President Gottwald," officially began the first regular voyage to China in the history of Polish shipping in April 1950. The opening of this route connected the ports of Poland and People's China. The pictures in this issue are taken by Zhu Bo, Li Yu, Zhang Li, and Wang Zhiyuan of this newspaper.
