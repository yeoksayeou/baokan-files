    What Does It Mean to Lead?
    Ma Tieding
    If you ask the Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in the countryside:
    "What is the task of a Party member or League member?"
    "To take the lead!" is almost the unanimous answer.
    How brave, how heroic!
    What rich content is contained in these short words! In the days of battle, they are at the forefront of the charge against the enemy; in the struggle of land reform, they stand at the forefront of the attack on the landlords; in the production movement, in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, they lead the way; when handing in public grain, they are the first to bring out the best grain. "Taking the lead" is synonymous with selflessness, self-sacrifice, and courageous advancement. Some say: there is no socialism in the countryside; we say: this is socialism!
    However, if you further ask:
    "How to lead?"
    The answers become very uneven.
    The following example is also a kind of answer: In a certain place, aphids appeared in the cotton fields. The local Party organization made an emergency decision: mobilize the masses to eliminate them day and night. When this decision reached a certain township, all Party members and League members, under the call of the general branch, immediately went into action and sprayed 1605 pesticide in the fields. The news quickly spread throughout the township, but no one followed to participate. Some people came out to watch the excitement, and others lay in bed and slept soundly.
    Such examples are isolated phenomena, but the ideas they reflect are quite common. That is: the spirit is heroic, but the method is "looking ahead but not behind."
    Therefore, the fundamental question is:
    "What does it mean to lead?"
    Comrades engaged in rural work must enable rural Party members and League members to correctly answer this question, not only in words but mainly in action.
    The principle is simple: the so-called "head" means that behind the "head," there are non-"heads." If the "head" is just a lonely individual, then it cannot be called a "head." The so-called "taking the lead" means bringing those who are behind forward. If only the "head" is marching forward with its head held high, but no one is following behind, then there is no such thing as "taking the lead."
    The meaning of "taking the lead," expressed in our usual terminology, is: to lead the masses along the correct direction indicated by the Party with one's own exemplary behavior. Here, of course, one's own exemplary behavior is indispensable, but this exemplary behavior faces the masses and aims to mobilize the masses to follow and move forward. Therefore, it is necessary to fully understand the ideological situation of the masses, do a good job in propaganda and organizational work, and use resounding mobilization slogans to get the masses to take action. There is a very profound and meticulous art in this.
    However, we can be sure that as long as we explain the complete content of "taking the lead" to rural Party members and League members, and rely on their heroic spirit, they will learn how to lead. As long as they truly understand this, our rural work will move forward.

### 什么叫带头

    什么叫带头
    马铁丁
    假如你问乡村的共产党员、青年团员：
    “党员、团员的任务是什么？”
    “起带头（作用）！”几乎是异口同声的回答。
    多么勇敢，多么豪迈！
    这简短的话，蕴含着何等丰富的内容呵！在战斗的日子里，向敌人冲锋陷阵，他们走在最前头；在土地改革的斗争中，向地主攻击，他们站在最前头；在生产运动中，在互助合作运动中，他们领先；在交公粮的时候，他们首先把最好的粮食拿出来。“起带头（作用）”，这是大公无私、自我牺牲和奋勇前进的同义语。有人说：农村没有什么社会主义；我们说：这就是社会主义！
    但是，假如你进一步问：
    “怎样带头？”
    回答就非常参差不齐了。
    如下的事例也是一种回答：某地，棉田里发生了蚜虫，当地党的组织就做出紧急决定：动员群众星夜除治。这决定到了某乡，全体党员、团员就在总支部的号召之下，马上出动，到地里喷射一六○五药水。消息很快传遍了全乡，但没有人跟着参加。一部分人出来看热闹，另一部分人呢，躺在炕上睡大觉。
    这样的事例是个别现象，反映的思想，却有相当普遍性。这就是：精神是英勇的，方法是“顾前不顾后”的。
    所以，问题的根本是：
    “什么叫带头？”
    从事乡村工作的同志必须使农村党员、团员能够正确地回答这个问题，不仅在口头上，主要是在行动上。
    道理是简单的：所谓“头”就是“头”的后面，还有非“头”存在，如果“头”只是孤伶伶的独个儿，那就说不上是“头”了。所谓“带头”，就是把走在后面的“带”上前来，如果只有“头”在昂首阔步地向前迈进，后面却没有人跟上来，那也就无所谓“带头”了。
    “带头”的意思，用我们平常的术语来表述，就是：以自己的模范行为带领群众沿着党所指示的正确方向前进。在这里，当然少不了自己的模范行为，但这种模范行为所面对的是群众，目的在于把群众动员起来跟着前进。因此，就要充分地了解群众的思想情况，做好宣传工作和组织工作，用响亮的动员口号，让群众行动起来，这当中，有着十分深刻和细致的艺术。
    然而，我们可以确信，只要向农村党员、团员讲清“带头”的完整的内容，依靠着他们的英勇精神，他们是会学会怎样带头的。只要他们真正懂得了这一点，我们的农村工作将会前进一步。
