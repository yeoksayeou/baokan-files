Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 29th: This reporter, Wu Min, reports: The U.S. propaganda machine is currently under orders to spread a theory that the current situation where the explanation work has been stalled for a long time due to U.S. instructions to the Li and Chiang secret agents to prevent prisoners of war from listening to the explanations, is being portrayed as the Korean and Chinese side "not wanting to resume the explanation work" or "deliberately delaying the explanation work."

However, the value of this trick by the U.S. side is equivalent to asking people to believe that the sun rises in the west. Who doesn't know that during the armistice negotiations, it was only under the repeated insistence of the Korean and Chinese side that the U.S. side reluctantly agreed to conduct explanations for Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated. And while agreeing to conduct explanations, the U.S. side made a series of preparations to sabotage the explanation work in the prisoner of war camps, trying its best to prevent its so-called "voluntary repatriation" myth from completely going bankrupt. The so-called "prisoner of war leaders" who are controlling the prisoner of war camps and using terror tactics such as beatings, murders, and intimidation to prevent prisoners of war from coming out to listen to the explanations, are precisely the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee bandit gang secret agent elements that the U.S. side planted among the prisoners of war to carry out sabotage activities.

These secret agent elements maintain contact with the U.S. side through radio receivers brought into the camp, through U.S. secret agent elements disguised as "doctors," "nurses," and "translators" in the prisoner of war camp hospitals, through secret agent elements acting as garbage truck drivers, and through light signals and semaphore. These secret agent elements are carrying out every instruction of their American masters, doing their best to obstruct the explanation work and murdering prisoners of war who demand repatriation.

The fact that secret agents are rampant in the Indian Custodial Forces camps has been repeatedly pointed out by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. On the 28th, General Thimayya announced that five Korean and Chinese prisoners of war had been killed by secret agents in the current prisoner of war camp.

More than one hundred Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who broke through the secret agent control and were repatriated also exposed the atrocities of the U.S. side directing secret agents to use force to coerce prisoners of war not to demand repatriation in Panmunjom in front of neutral country personnel and reporters from both sides. The U.S. propaganda machine's lackeys have never dared to report on the prisoners of war's accusations, and the U.S. authorities have never dared to deny them.

While the U.S. side directs secret agents to use the most cruel and barbaric methods to abuse and kill prisoners of war, prohibiting them from accepting explanations or demanding repatriation, and even causing the explanation work to be suspended, on the other hand, it shamelessly calls this beastly behavior its "victory." People cannot help but be surprised at the stupidity and depravity of the U.S. imperialists. Hitler also admired his own so-called "victory," but upright and kind people also forced him to admit his failure by committing suicide.

In order to defeat the U.S. side's sabotage conspiracy, and to preserve the lives of the prisoners of war and their right to be repatriated, the Korean and Chinese side requests the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to immediately carry out the duties entrusted to it by the Armistice Agreement, and take various effective measures to stop secret agent activities in the camps, eliminate the secret agents, so that the prisoners of war can get rid of the control of the secret agents and have genuine freedom to express their desire to be repatriated. This is not only for the benefit of the prisoners of war, but also to enable the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to fairly carry out its sacred duties. The U.S. propaganda machine is now attempting to slander the Korean and Chinese side's request as "obstructing" and "sabotaging" the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which is not only extremely boring, but also, according to this logic, the U.S. directing secret agents to prevent prisoners of war from listening to explanations, making it impossible for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to carry out the tasks stipulated for it by the "scope of authority" and "detailed rules for explanation and visitation work," would be "assisting" rather than "obstructing" and "sabotaging" the work of the commission. The sole purpose of this slander by the U.S. side is obviously to escape responsibility for the U.S. secret agent sabotage activities in the prisoner of war camps.

### 美国宣传机器大肆造谣歪曲解释工作陷于停顿的原因  妄图推卸美方阻挠和破坏解释工作的责任

    美国宣传机器大肆造谣歪曲解释工作陷于停顿的原因
    妄图推卸美方阻挠和破坏解释工作的责任
    【新华社开城二十九日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：美国宣传机器最近正在奉命散布一种论调，把目前解释工作由于美方指使李、蒋特务不许战俘听取解释而长期停顿的情势，说成是朝中方面“不希望恢复解释工作”或“故意拖延解释工作”。
    但是，美方的这个把戏，其价值等于叫人相信太阳是从西方出来的一样。谁不知道，在停战谈判过程中，只是在朝中方面再三坚持之下，美方才勉强同意对不直接遣返的朝中战俘进行解释。而美方在同意进行解释的同时，就在战俘营中作了一系列的破坏解释工作的准备，竭力使它的所谓“自愿遣返”神话不致完全破产。现在那些控制着战俘营场，并且用毒打、谋杀、恫吓等恐怖手段不让战俘出来听取解释的所谓“战俘领袖”，就是美方安插在战俘中间进行破坏活动的国民党和李承晚匪帮的特务分子。
    这些特务分子通过带进看管营场的无线电收音机，通过在战俘营医院中扮作“医生”、“护士”、
    “翻译”的美方特务分子，通过充当垃圾汽车司机的特务分子，通过灯光信号和旗语，和美方继续保持着联系。这些特务分子正在执行他们的美国主子的每一个指示，竭力阻挠解释工作的进行，谋杀要求遣返的战俘。
    在印度看管部队营地中特务横行的事实，中立国遣返委员会已经一再指出。蒂迈雅中将二十八日就宣布，有五名朝中被俘人员在现在的战俘营中被特务杀害。
    突破特务控制获得遣返的一百多名朝中被俘人员也在板门店当着中立国人员和双方记者的面，揭露了美方指挥特务用武力胁迫战俘不得要求遣返的暴行。美国宣传机器的佣仆们对于战俘们的控诉从来不敢报道，美方当局也从来不敢否认。
    美方一面指使特务用最残酷野蛮的方法来虐杀战俘，禁止他们接受解释或要求遣返，甚至使解释工作遭受停顿，另一方面却又不知羞耻地把他们的这种野兽行为称之为他们的“胜利”。人们对于美帝国主义者的愚蠢和堕落程度不能不感到惊讶。希特勒也曾经欣赏过他自己的这种所谓“胜利”的，但是正直和善良的人民却也曾逼得他以自杀来承认他的失败。
    为了击破美方的破坏阴谋，为了保全战俘的生命及其被遣返的权利，朝中方面要求中立国遣返委员会立即执行停战协定所赋予它的职权，采取各种有效措施来制止营场中的特务活动，清除特务，使战俘能够摆脱特务的控制，有真正的自由来表达他们要求遣返的意愿。这不仅是为了战俘的利益，也是为了使中立国遣返委员会能够公正地执行它的神圣职责。美国宣传机器现在企图诬蔑朝中方面的这种要求是“阻挠”和“破坏”中立国遣返委员会的工作，不仅是穷极无聊，而且照这样说来，美国指挥特务不许战俘听取解释，使中立国遣返委员会不能执行“职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”所规定给它的任务，倒是“协助”而不是“阻挠”和
    “破坏”委员会工作。美方这种诬蔑的唯一目的，显然就是为了逃脱对战俘营中的美方特务破坏活动的责任。
