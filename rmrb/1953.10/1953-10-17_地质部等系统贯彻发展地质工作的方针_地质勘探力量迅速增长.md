    The geological exploration teams of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Geology, Ministry of Heavy Industry, and Ministry of Fuel Industry are rapidly growing.
    Although geological science in our country has a history of more than 30 years, before liberation, there were only hundreds of geological workers, the exploration equipment was very crude, and most of the drilling workers changed careers due to livelihood problems. After liberation, when the drilling team of the Beijing Geological Survey was established in April 1949, there were only five or six people and a few broken machines. The staff repaired the machines and looked for workers. At that time, some old technicians did not believe that the situation could be opened up. However, after arduous efforts, drilling began experimentally in Mentougou in October 1949, and by April 1950, five drilling rigs were officially running. Now, with the restoration and development of national economic construction, the face of geological exploration work has greatly changed. In the past four years, the number of geological exploration personnel has increased from hundreds to tens of thousands.
    This year, the Central People's Government's Ministry of Geology resolutely implemented the policy of large-scale development and transformation. After more than half a year of efforts, the geological exploration team has grown from 7,000 people in January of this year to more than 15,000 people now. It has established and expanded geological, drilling, trenching, tunneling, physical prospecting, chemical prospecting, surveying, and testing exploration work, and increased mechanical equipment, instruments, and other equipment. The geological strength of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has increased more than threefold in the past six months. At the beginning of this year, the geological exploration personnel of the ministry numbered only 5,335, but now it has increased to more than 15,000. In terms of mechanical equipment, there were only more than 100 drilling rigs, but now there are 400. The geological exploration personnel of the Ministry of Fuel Industry had increased to more than 15,500 by July of this year. The development of the No. 241 and No. 321 geological exploration teams directly under the Central Geological Department is an epitome of the rapid growth and strengthening of geological forces in our country. When the No. 241 team was established in 1950, it had only one drilling rig and more than a dozen drilling workers. In 1952, it increased to three drilling rigs and more than 50 staff members. By April 1953, it already had 30 drilling rigs and more than 600 drilling workers. After April, the team has developed into a comprehensive geological exploration team with work scope including geology, drilling, trenching, tunneling, physical prospecting, surveying, testing, hydrogeology, maintenance, etc. The entire team has more than 2,000 people. The No. 321 team, which was only established in May last year, has also developed into a comprehensive geological exploration team, and now has 12 drilling rigs and more than 600 staff members.
    In order to train a large number of geological exploration talents, the Central Geological Department, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, and the Ministry of Fuel Industry have adopted various active measures. The Ministry of Geology firmly grasps the links of strengthening political and ideological education, relying on the working class, and uniting and transforming technical personnel to carry out the work of training geological exploration talents, and has opened higher and secondary geological schools under the conditions of considerable shortage of cadres and teachers. The Beijing and Northeast Geological Institutes have now been established. The Beijing Geological Institute has a total of 1,560 students, and 188 graduates have participated in work this year. The Northeast Geological Institute has a total of 1,913 students, and 67 have graduated this year and have taken up their jobs. This summer, the geological exploration team added a new batch of reserves. The Beijing Geological Institute enrolled 1,260 new students, and the Northeast Geological Institute enrolled 870 new students. The Ministry of Geology and its subordinate bureaus have also held various professional short-term training courses. In drilling alone, four drilling schools have been opened to specialize in training drillers and prospecting technicians. In order to cultivate reserve forces, the Ministry of Fuel Industry has taken over and established two universities and colleges, 18 secondary technical schools, six technical schools, one cadre school, and two health schools in the past four years. Now, 1,538 students have graduated and have begun to participate in work. The Ministry of Fuel Industry has also entrusted various universities to help train technical personnel. The Ministry of Heavy Industry has trained more than 3,000 people at the Changchun Drilling School alone.
    In order to accelerate the training of geological exploration talents, each geological exploration team simultaneously implemented the policy of working, teaching, and learning at the same time, and cultivated a large number of trainees and apprentices. For example, the methods of the 321 team for training cadres and technicians include normal political and professional studies. In professional studies, it is closely integrated with actual operations. When workers discover problems in operation, they ask teachers in the classroom to help solve them; if workers do not understand enough in the classroom, teachers help them solve them in actual operations. The cadres and workers trained in this way not only have a certain political consciousness and technical level, but also have general technical theoretical knowledge. Because of this method, the number of technicians in the 321 team has increased from more than 20 to more than 300 in one year, and more than 70 technicians have been transferred to fraternal teams.
    Now, in order to further strengthen the force of geological exploration, each ministry has decided to take the following measures: 1. Actively improve the existing technical force. The specific methods are: learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and implement expert suggestions; continue to implement the policy of working, teaching and learning at the same time, and mobilize employees to learn from each other and take on a large number of apprentices; through summarizing work, educate employees with specific facts to improve their ideological and technical level. 2. In order to train technical cadres, the Ministry of Geology has added two secondary technical schools in the second half of this year, and recruited 1,150 new students this summer vacation. The Ministry of Heavy Industry has established two technical schools, and is preparing to establish a training class in Harbin to train junior technicians, first training a group of testers. Each ministry has also decided that each unit will continue to hold various training classes to train technical workers.

    地质部等系统贯彻发展地质工作的方针
    地质勘探力量迅速增长
    【本报讯】中央人民政府地质部、重工业部、燃料工业部各系统的地质勘探队伍正在迅速壮大。
    地质科学在我国虽然已有三十多年的历史，但在解放前，地质工作人员只有数百人，勘探设备非常简陋，钻探工人也因为生活问题大部分改行了。解放后，北京地质调查所钻探队在一九四九年四月间成立时，一共只有五六个人和几部破机器。工作人员一面修机器，一面找工人。当时有一部分老技术人员不相信局面能够打开。但是经过艰苦的努力，终于在一九四九年十月开始在门头沟试验钻探，到一九五○年四月就有五台钻机正式转动了。现在随着国家经济建设的恢复和发展，地质勘探工作的面貌已大大改观了，四年来地质勘探人员已由几百人发展到几万人。
    中央人民政府地质部今年坚决执行了大发展、大转变的方针，经过半年多的努力，地质勘探队伍由今年一月份的七千人发展到现在的一万五千多人，建立和扩大了地质、钻探、坑探、槽探、物理探矿、化学探矿、测量、化验等勘探工作，增加了机械、仪器等设备。重工业部地质力量半年来增长了三倍以上，今年年初该部地质勘探人员只有五千三百三十五人，现在已增加到一万五千多人；在机械设备方面，钻机只有一百多台，现在已有四百台。燃料工业部地质勘探人员，到今年七月份已增加到一万五千五百多人。中央地质部直属二四一、三二一地质勘探队的发展情况，就是我国地质力量迅速增长和壮大的缩影。二四一队在一九五○年成立时只有一部钻机和十多个钻探工人，一九五二年增加到三部钻机和五十多个工作人员，到一九五三年四月已经有三十部钻机和六百多个钻探工人。四月以后，该队已经发展成为综合性的地质勘探队，工作范围包括地质、钻探、槽探、坑探、物理探矿、测量、化验、水文地质、修配等等，全队已有两千多人。去年五月才成立的三二一队，也已发展为综合性的地质勘探队，现在已有十二部钻机和工作人员六百多名。
    中央地质部、重工业部和燃料工业部为培养大量的地质勘探人材，采取了各种积极的办法。地质部紧紧掌握着加强政治思想教育，依靠工人阶级，团结和改造技术人员等环节，进行培养地质勘探人材方面的工作，并在干部和师资相当缺乏的条件下，开办了高等、中等地质学校。现在已成立的有北京、东北两个地质学院。北京地质学院共有学生一千五百六十人，今年已有毕业生一百八十八人参加了工作。东北地质学院共有学生一千九百一十三人，今年已有六十七人毕业，走上了工作岗位。今年暑期，地质勘探队伍又增加了一批后备力量，北京地质学院招收新生一千二百六十名，东北地质学院招收新生八百七十名。地质部及所属各局还举办了各种专业的短期训练班，仅在钻探方面就开办了四个钻探学校，专门培养钻工及探矿技术人员。燃料工业部为了培养后备力量，四年来接办、开办的学校已有大学和专科学校两所、中等技术学校十八所、技工学校六所、干部学校一所和卫生学校两所，现在已有一千五百三十八名学生毕业，开始参加工作。燃料工业部还委托各大学帮助培养技术人员。重工业部仅在长春钻探学校就培养了三千多人。
    为加速培养地质勘探人材，各个地质勘探队同时贯彻了边作、边教、边学的方针，培养了大批练习生和徒工。例如三二一队培养干部和技术工人的办法，有正常的政治和业务学习。业务学习中紧密结合实际操作，工人在操作中发现了问题，就在课堂上请教员帮助解决；工人在课堂上领会不够的东西，教员又在实际操作中帮助他们解决。这样培养出来的干部和工人，不仅具有一定的政治觉悟和技术水平，而且具有一般的技术理论知识。由于采取了这种办法，三二一队的技术员在一年之内已由二十几个发展到三百多个，并且向兄弟队输送了七十多个技术人员。
    现在，各部为进一步加强地质勘探的力量，已决定采取下列措施：一、积极提高现有技术力量，具体办法为：学习苏联先进经验，贯彻专家建议；继续贯彻边作边教边学的方针，发动职工互相学习，大量带徒弟；通过总结工作，以具体事实教育职工，提高思想与技术水平。二、为培养技术干部，地质部今年下半年增设了两个中等技术学校，今年暑假招收新生一千一百五十名。重工业部办了两个技术学校，另在哈尔滨筹备成立训练班，培养初级技术人员，首先培养一批化验人员。各部并决定由各单位继续举办各种不同的训练班，培养技术工人。
