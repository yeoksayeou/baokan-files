    Powerful Counterattack, Glorious Victory
    Jin Feng
    In mid-June, the eyes of the world were focused on Panmunjom. Suddenly, news came that Syngman Rhee had forcibly detained more than 27,000 of our captured personnel, and the armistice negotiations were threatened again. Millions of peace-loving hearts were moved and angered. The volunteer soldiers standing at the forefront of defending peace said: "Syngman Rhee is妄想堵住和平的大门，我们要用胜利来把它打开！"
    (1)
    On the night of July 13th, an unusual silence appeared on the arc-shaped front line of more than 30 kilometers wide, west of the Bukhan River, east of Kimhwa, and south of Kumseong on the Korean front. The Rhee puppet troops, hiding in layers of cover trenches, tunnels, bunkers, and pillboxes, were dreaming of "advancing north" and "unifying Korea." Suddenly, dazzling flares pierced the dark night sky, and thousands of artillery pieces roared deafeningly, and the enemy's positions were immediately filled with smoke and fire. Our Volunteer Army launched a powerful counterattack with an invincible momentum in three directions. The central army猛攻轿岩山; the western army broke through Heights 522.1, 522.8, and 424.2, and插向月烽山、梨实洞; the eastern army 插到金城川以北from Dengdaeri and Kwangdaedong. In less than an hour, the heavily defended defense lines of four divisions of the Rhee puppet army were completely breached by our army. The enemy was in complete chaos, unable to attend to both ends, and begged for support. The enemy's radio was filled with cries of "position lost" and "prepare to retreat."

    The dying enemy was making a desperate struggle. Fierce fighting was unfolding on Gyojang Mountain in the central sector. Gyojang Mountain, about 20 square kilometers in area, with steep mountains and narrow roads, was easy to defend and difficult to attack. It protruded from the central front end of the Kumseong battle line and was the main defense position of the enemy's division. Here, the enemy had worked hard for two years. The position was covered with eight or nine layers of barbed wire, as well as a large number of bunkers, tunnels, semi-tunnels, concealed bunkers, trenches, cover trenches, and communication trenches interconnected to form a complete defense system. A large number of tripwire,踏火, and illuminating mines were set up in front of the fortifications, as well as napalm bombs that would explode and burn on contact. About a regiment or more of heavy troops guarded the position, and the position was also covered by the intersecting firepower of the puppet 6th Division and the puppet 8th Division. The enemy妄想以此来挡住志愿军的前进. But the volunteer soldiers said: "In order to strive for peace, we dare to drill into the tiger's mouth, and we dare to climb the mountain of knives." On the order to charge, the soldiers disregarded the enemy's barrage of fire, disregarded the torrential rain, broke through layers of barbed wire, broke through heavy bunkers, and charged up like a whirlwind.
    Under the main peak of Gyojang Mountain, a storm of bullets rained down on the charging warriors. Li Jiafa, a 19-year-old member of the Youth League, was crawling in the mud. Feeling the only two dynamite grenades left on his body, he climbed straight towards the firing bunker. A string of bullets from a small bunker in front of the large bunker pierced his left foot. He threw a grenade to destroy the small bunker and continued to move forward. The enemy's flares hung in the cloudy, rainy night sky. Comrades-in-arms watched as Li Jiafa dragged his injured leg and crawled towards the large bunker that was spewing fire. They saw him raise his right hand and throw the only grenade into it. As black smoke rose, the enemy's machine gun stopped roaring. Everyone stood up from the mud and charged forward, shouting kill. Suddenly, dense bullets sprinkled again on the muddy water in front. Under the order of "stop advancing," everyone lay down again. But the situation was urgent. It was going to be dawn, and the main peak had to be taken before dawn. Just as the instructor ordered other comrades to "continue blasting," the gunshots in the large bunker in front fell silent. The warriors immediately jumped up and rushed to the enemy's position. They saw Li Jiafa's young body lying on the gun hole of the bunker, his half-closed eyes 注射着 the huge rocks of the main peak. Seeing such a heroic image, the warriors rushed towards the main peak with a vengeful heart. At dawn, the big red flag that Li Jiafa had signed fluttered in the wind on the top of Gyojang Mountain. By dawn, the fierce battle to storm Gyojang Mountain was completely over. The gullies, ridges, and trenches on the top of the mountain, covered with dense bomb craters, were full of dead bodies lying horizontally and vertically. More than 2,600 enemies made a futile sacrifice on Gyojang Mountain.

    While the central army was advancing on Gyojang Mountain, our eastern and western armies, like a pair of tiger tongs with their mouths open, extended directly into the enemy's deep positions.
    After successively breaking through several enemy heights, our western army rushed straight to Yuefeng Mountain and captured Yuefeng Mountain in one fell swoop before dawn. Then they chased after the fleeing enemies who were desperately fleeing south. The enemy was even more chaotic, each caring for his own escape. They dropped the steaming rice pots, dropped the weapons loaded with bullets, dropped the trucks loaded with supplies, and dropped the artillery groups ready to fire. The road was full of enemy corpses and equipment; on the highway from Kumseong to Hwacheon, cars were running over corpses, and tanks were blocking cars. A volunteer reconnaissance unit, led by platoon leader Wang Yiming, chased straight down the road west of Yuefeng Mountain. After dawn, they arrived near the river near Xiazhenxian, where they captured Lin Yichun, the deputy commander of the elite puppet Capital Division. It turned out that on the night of the 13th, he was playing mahjong with several section chiefs when he suddenly heard that the front line was in emergency. The division commander ordered him to come and supervise the battle. Who knew that as soon as he arrived at the regimental headquarters of the puppet First Regiment, he was attacked by a volunteer reconnaissance unit. He fled in a panic, planning to flee back by car, but the driver had already slipped away. He had no choice but to flee in dismay with his adjutant and guards. He finally reached the river bank, but the river had risen and he could not cross, so he became a prisoner.
    In the eastern sector, first-class meritorious Pan Changyi led a team and was the first to reach the vicinity of the Kumseong River. The enemy had already placed explosives on this large iron bridge across the Kumseong River and installed an engine. As long as the button was pressed, the bridge would be blown up. When Pan Changyi arrived, he saw three enemies preparing to blow up the bridge. This was indeed a moment of extreme urgency. A slight hesitation would destroy the iron bridge, cut off the road to advance, and allow the retreating enemies to escape. The entire victory would also be affected. Pan Changyi immediately set up a machine gun and fired rapidly. The three enemies were so frightened that they scurried away with their heads in their hands, without even having time to press the button. The soldiers took advantage of the victory to cross the bridge, advancing straight in and chasing all the way to Jukdong.
    At this time, the vanguard team of the artillery company climbed up a mountain ridge north of Jukdong and discovered that about two battalions of enemies were retreating from Gyojang Mountain, and cars dragging榴弹炮 were running backwards. Deputy Company Commander Feng Guangli directed heavy machine guns to fire on the infantry, and recoilless guns to fire on the cars. The retreating enemies suddenly heard bullets and shells raining down on them from the mountain ridge on their side and rear, and they were so frightened that their souls were scattered and they were immediately thrown into chaos. Feng Guangli ordered the fourth squad to run down the mountain and set up the machine gun on the highway by the river. So, three machine guns roared across the rushing river. Some of the enemies were killed, some jumped into the river and drowned, and some were taken prisoner.
    Then, the armies in all directions continued to advance south with the momentum of galloping horses, forming an encirclement of the enemy. In an area 20 kilometers wide, 10 kilometers deep, and 200 square kilometers, a large-scale annihilation battle began. At this time, from the Supreme Headquarters to the command posts at all levels, telephone bells kept ringing and good news kept coming. Our dozens of armies of various arms attacked in multiple directions,穿插合围, closely coordinated, and fought rhythmically and orderly from top to bottom under unified command. Resolutely, thoroughly, and cleanly eliminate the encircled enemy.

    The Kumseong counterattack ended victoriously on July 18th. It showed that the balance of power between the enemy and us had reached a new milestone. In the autumn of 1951, in the same area, Van Fleet launched the so-called "Autumn Offensive." After more than a month, at the cost of tens of thousands of casualties, they only advanced two to fifteen miles and occupied 132 square kilometers of land. In this counterattack, our Volunteer Army only used five days and nights to recover all 170 square kilometers of land and eliminate more than 26,000 enemies. It directly promoted the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement in July, which was an outstanding contribution of the Volunteer Army to the cause of world peace. If the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang still have not learned a lesson from these惨败, then, as the hero Lai Yongze said in this counterattack: "Well, let it try again!"

    强大的反击，光辉的胜利
    金凤
    六月中旬，全世界的眼光都注视着板门店。突然，传来了李承晚强迫扣留二万七千余名我方被俘人员的消息，停战谈判再度受到威胁。千百万颗爱好和平的心激动而愤怒起来。站在保卫和平最前哨的志愿军战士说：“李承晚妄想堵住和平的大门，我们要用胜利来把它打开！”
    （一）
    七月十三日夜晚，朝鲜前线北汉江以西、金化以东、金城以南横宽三十多公里的弓形战线上，出现了一阵不寻常的寂静。躲在重重盖沟、坑道、地堡和碉堡内的李伪军，正在做着“向北推进”“统一朝鲜”的迷梦。突然，光彩夺目的信号弹划破了漆黑的夜空，千百门大炮发出震天动地的轰鸣，敌人的阵地上立刻烟火弥漫。我志愿军三路大军以所向无敌的气势发起强大反击。中路大军猛攻轿岩山；西路大军突破五二二点一，五二二点八，四二四点二诸高地，直插月烽山、梨实洞；东路大军自登大里、广大洞插到金城川以北。不到一小时，坚固设防的李伪军四个师的防御阵地被我军全部突破。敌人陷于一片混乱，首尾不能相顾，纷纷哀求支援。在敌人的报话机中，充满一片“阵地失守”“准备撤退”的哀鸣。
    （二）
    垂死的敌人作着绝望的挣扎。在中路轿岩山的激战在展开着。轿岩山周围二十平方公里，山陡路窄，易守难攻，突出在金城战线的中前端，是敌人的师防御主阵地。在这里，敌人经过了两年的苦心经营。阵地上布满着八、九道铁丝网，还有大量的地堡、坑道和半坑道、暗堡、战壕、盖沟、交通沟相互连贯，形成完整的防御体系。工事前设置大批拉火、踏火和照明地雷，也有一碰就爆炸燃烧的凝固汽油弹。阵地上约有一个团以上的重兵把守，阵地后面又有伪六师和伪八师交叉的火力掩护。敌人妄想以此来挡住志愿军的前进。但志愿军战士说：“为了争取和平，老虎嘴我们敢钻，刀山我们敢上。”冲锋令下，战士们不顾敌人的拦阻炮火，不顾倾盆的大雨，突破层层铁丝网，突破重重的地堡，风卷似地冲了上去。
    在轿岩山的主峰下，一阵狂风骤雨般的子弹洒到正在冲锋的勇士跟前。十九岁的青年团员李家发爬在泥泞里。他摸着身上仅剩的两颗炸药手榴弹，直向射击的大碉堡爬去。从大碉堡跟前一个小地堡发出的一串子弹打穿了他的左脚，他扔了一颗手榴弹消灭了那个小地堡继续前进。敌人的照明弹挂在阴云密布、大雨滂沱的夜空，战友们眼看着李家发拖着一只受伤的腿向那吐着火舌的大碉堡爬去。只见他扬起右手，把唯一的一颗手榴弹投进去。随着冒起的黑烟，敌人的机枪停止了吼叫。大家从泥泞里站起来，喊着杀声向前猛冲。突然，密集的子弹又撒在面前的泥水里。在“停止前进”的口令下，大家又重新卧倒。但是情况是紧急的，天要亮了，必须在天亮以前拿下主峰。指导员刚刚命令其他同志“继续爆破”时，面前大碉堡里的枪声沉默了。勇士们立即跃起冲上敌人阵地，只见李家发年轻的身体伏在碉堡的枪眼上，半闭的眼注射着主峰的巨石。看见了这等英雄形象，勇士们以复仇的心情冲向主峰。黎明，李家发曾经签过名的大红旗，迎风飘扬在轿岩山顶。天明，强攻轿岩山的激战全部结束。布满了稠密弹坑的山沟、山梁以及山头堑壕，到处是横躺竖卧的死尸。两千六百多名敌人就在轿岩山上做了无谓的牺牲。
    （三）
    在中路大军进击轿岩山的同时，我东西两路大军像一把张口待合的虎头钳一样直向敌人的纵深阵地伸去。
    我西路大军在连续突破敌人几个高地之后，直扑月烽山，并于黎明之前将月烽山一举攻占，接着就向拼命南逃的溃敌追去，敌人更加混乱，各顾逃生，他们丢掉了冒着热气的饭锅，丢掉了装着子弹的武器，丢掉了满载物资的汽车，丢掉了实弹待发的炮群，一路上是敌人的尸体和装备；从金城通华川的公路上，汽车压着尸体，坦克挡住汽车。志愿军一支侦察部队在排长王义明的率领下，沿着月烽山西边的公路直追下去，天明后赶到下榛岘附近河边，就在这里俘掳了号称精锐的伪首都师副师长林益淳。原来十三日那天晚上，他正和几个科长打麻将，忽然听到前方告急，师长命令他前来督战。谁知他刚到了伪第一团团部，就遭到了志愿军一支侦察部队的袭击，他慌忙跑了出来，打算乘车回窜，谁知司机早已溜之大吉。他只好带了副官和卫兵落荒而逃，好容易到了河边，但河水已涨，不得过去，就当了俘虏。
    在东路一等功功臣潘长义带着一个小组首先赶到金城川附近。敌人在这座横跨金城川的大铁桥上早已放好炸药，按上发动机，只要一按电钮，大桥就会炸断。潘长义赶到时只见三个敌人正准备炸桥。这真是万分紧急的时刻，稍一迟疑，铁桥就会毁灭，前进的道路就会断绝，溃退的敌人就会逃脱。整个的胜利也就要受到影响。潘长义立即架起机枪急速发射，三个敌人吓得抱头鼠窜，连电钮都没有来得及一按。战士们乘胜过桥，长驱直进，一直追到竹洞。
    这时机炮连的尖兵组爬上竹洞以北一道山梁，发现约有两个营的敌人从轿岩山溃退下来，拖着榴弹炮的汽车向后飞跑。副连长冯广礼指挥重机枪打步兵，无座力炮打汽车。正在溃逃的敌人忽然听到侧后山梁上子弹炮弹劈头盖顶地压下来，吓得魂不附体，登时乱成一团。冯广礼命令四班跑步下山，把机枪架在河边公路上。于是三挺机枪，隔着急流的河水怒吼起来。敌人有的被打死，有的跳在河里被淹死，有的当了俘虏。
    接着各路大军以万马奔腾之势，继续向南挺进，对敌形成合围。在二十公里宽、十公里纵深、二百平方公里地区内，一场大围歼战开始了。这时，从最高司令部到各级指挥所内，电话铃不断震响，捷报不断传来，我各兵种数十路大军则在统一指挥下，多路攻击，穿插合围，紧密配合，从上到下有节奏有秩序地战斗。坚决、彻底、干净地消灭被包围的敌人。
    （四）
    金城反击战到七月十八日胜利结束，它显示了敌我力量消长达到了新的标志，一九五一年秋，正是在同一地区，范佛里特发起了所谓“秋季攻势”。经过了一个多月时间，付出伤亡数万人的代价，才仅仅前进两华里到十五华里，侵占了一百三十二平方公里的土地。而这次反击战中，我志愿军仅仅用五昼夜的时间，全部收复一百七十平方公里土地，消灭敌人两万六千多人。它直接促进了七月朝鲜停战协定的签字，这是志愿军对世界和平事业的杰出贡献。如果美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮仍然没有从这些惨败中得到教训的话，那就像这次反击战中的英雄赖永泽所说的：“那末，让它再来试试吧！”
