    Uphold the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's Impartial Work

    In his speeches and talks on October 9th and 10th, Indian Prime Minister Nehru addressed the issue of prisoner of war repatriation following the Korean Armistice. He analyzed the grave situation, created by the United States' unreasonable obstruction and sabotage, which is detrimental to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's smooth and impartial work. He also stated that India will continue to implement its neutral policy to complete its task in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Simultaneously, Prime Minister Nehru demanded that the United States be responsible for fulfilling all the terms of the Armistice Agreement.

    Righteous people in all countries are closely watching the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique's blatant crimes of deliberately sabotaging the Armistice Agreement and attempting to continue forcibly detaining prisoners of war. They believe that timely containment of these crimes and upholding the impartial work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission are crucial conditions for ensuring further peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and consolidating peace in Asia and the world. The Indian government, which honorably serves as the chairman and arbitrator of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, is naturally particularly concerned about this.

    The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was established by agreement between the warring parties in Korea, and its terms of reference have been clearly defined in the Armistice Agreement. Recently, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has made some necessary arrangements regarding the explanation and interview work with prisoners of war. For example, it has approved the detailed rules for explanation and interview work, explained to the prisoners of war the terms of reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the prisoners' right to freely express their desire to return home to a peaceful life, and instructed both parties to provide the necessary venues and facilities to facilitate the explanation and interview work. All these arrangements are basically in accordance with the provisions of the terms of reference and have been carried out on the basis of the unanimous agreement of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. However, the United States, which has no respect for the Armistice Agreement it signed, openly launches brutal and unreasonable attacks, slanders, and intimidations against the current impartial work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. When its so-called protests and unreasonable demands to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission continuously failed to achieve their purpose, it became even more enraged. The Syngman Rhee clique, which has always been condoned by the United States, even clamored to use force to abduct prisoners of war under the custody of the Indian troops of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and clamored to "drive the Indian troops out of Korea." At the same time, the United States continues to unreasonably delay the construction of explanation sites, intensifying the instigation of Rhee and Chiang's special agents to carry out terror control in prisoner of war camps, launch riots, and create "collective escapes," in an attempt to completely sabotage the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and drive this commission out of Korea or squeeze it out, so as to achieve its goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

    It is clear that the reason why the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is suffering the attacks of the United States is simply because the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is striving to carry out the impartial work of the "terms of reference," and such impartial work does not suit the taste of the United States and is not conducive to the United States continuing to forcibly detain prisoners of war. People see that, on the one hand, U.S. Commander-in-Chief Clark, in his so-called protest letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, openly demanded that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission accept the United States' already bankrupt shameful lie that our captured personnel have already "chosen" "not to be repatriated"; on the other hand, the United States is doing its utmost to oppose individual explanations and interviews with prisoners of war, attempting to instruct Chiang and Rhee's special agents to coerce our captured personnel not to attend explanations and interviews, and groundlessly claiming that prisoners of war can refuse to accept explanations and interviews. Until now, the United States still refuses to provide sufficient explanation sites so that we can begin full-scale explanation work to the prisoners of war. At the same time, they are extremely tyrannical in refusing to extend the explanation time so that we can have ninety days for explanation in accordance with the agreement. The United States' conspiracy to arbitrarily distort and undermine the terms of reference and attempt to sabotage the entire arrangement of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and what are their ulterior motives, can be seen through by a three-year-old child. If the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission yields to this conspiracy of the United States, then the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is bound to become a tool for the United States and the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek cliques to collude to forcibly detain prisoners of war. This is obviously absolutely unacceptable to any neutral country with self-respect.

    The unreasonable attitude of the United States towards the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission once again exposes the United States' brutal obliteration, contempt, and mockery of neutral countries. The United States has always been domineering and arrogant, arbitrarily breaking its promises and international agreements it has signed, and hostile to any peaceful motives and efforts. Even if the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is invited by both parties through agreement to engage in impartial service for the repatriation work of prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated, the United States actually believes that it should not be impartial, but should obey the orders of the United States and be arbitrarily manipulated. Under the so-called "policy of strength" of the United States, the United States does not recognize countries that are unwilling to serve the United States' aggressive policy but are willing to serve peace as neutral countries, and it will slander them in every possible way, oppress them, and even attempt to drive them away; the United States only allows the activities of countries that obey its aggressive policies and abandon their neutral stance. It is precisely because of this that the United States refuses to allow neutral countries to participate in the issue of membership in the political conference, and insists that only the countries at war in Korea are qualified to participate. The reason why the United States is jealous of truly neutral countries is sufficient to prove that the United States knows that it is unreasonable and self-aware that its conspiracies to sabotage and intensify international tension cannot be made public. If this were not the case, then the United States should welcome the legitimate activities of neutral countries, why would it be afraid and exclude neutral countries from having the opportunity to serve the cause of peace?

    Completely contrary to the unreasonable attitude of the United States, the Korean and Chinese sides believe that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's exercise of its duties in accordance with the "terms of reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" agreed upon by both parties to the armistice should be absolutely respected.

    The first paragraph of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" stipulates that the purpose of establishing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is to "ensure all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated after the armistice"; the eighth paragraph stipulates that after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission takes over all prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated, it shall provide the country to which the prisoners of war belong with the freedom and convenience to "explain their rights to all prisoners of war attached to the country to which they belong, and inform them of any matters related to their return home, especially that they have complete freedom to return home to a peaceful life." The third paragraph also stipulates that "no force or threat of force shall be used against prisoners of war to hinder or compel their repatriation." Obviously, according to the basic spirit of the terms of reference, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should have full freedom and power to exercise its duties, and the United States shall not interfere. Therefore, the "terms of reference" is the only standard for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to perform its duties, and it is also the only standard for measuring whether it is truly neutral. Indian Prime Minister Nehru said in his speech: "As far as India is concerned, our principle is: we will be impartial and not influenced by anyone. We are an independent country, and our policy will also be an independent policy." "We will continue to do our work impartially." What all people who wish to peacefully resolve the Korean issue require of India and other neutral countries is precisely this impartial stance of implementing the "terms of reference."

    In order to ensure that the "terms of reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" are not undermined and to ensure that all prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated home to a peaceful life, we believe that all prisoners of war under the custody of neutral countries must be given a full explanation by representatives of the countries to which the prisoners of war belong, telling them that they can return home to a peaceful life in accordance with the provisions of the "terms of reference," so that is truly "respecting the individual will of the prisoners of war." In order to ensure that the necessary explanations are given to the prisoners of war so that they can exercise their right to be repatriated, the explanation period must be extended so that the ninety-day explanation period is not encroached upon or reduced. The United States has repeatedly delayed the issue of building explanation sites on the one hand, and disagreed to extend the ninety-day explanation period on the other hand, which is a planned conspiracy to sabotage this central link of the terms of reference, which is an attempt to completely deprive the right to explain to prisoners of war, and which is also an attempt to completely deprive the prisoners of war of the right to express their repatriation home to a peaceful life. If the United States continues to act recklessly in this way and thereby squeezes the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission out of Korea, then this must be considered a serious crime by the United States in undermining the Korean armistice.

    Under the circumstances of such arbitrary delay and sabotage of the explanation work by the United States, the difficulties faced by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custodial forces in carrying out their missions are obvious. All people in the world who love peace and yearn for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue are sympathizing with the impartial work being carried out by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Only the enemies of peace will adopt an unreasonable attitude towards the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. All advocates of peace should support India and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in adhering to the impartial work of the "terms of reference." The forces of peace will surely prevail over the forces of war.

### 维护中立国遣返委员会的公正工作

    维护中立国遣返委员会的公正工作
    印度总理尼赫鲁在十月九日和十日先后发表的演说和谈话中，谈到朝鲜停战后的战俘遣返问题。他分析了目前由于美方的无理阻挠和破坏所造成的不利于中立国遣返委员会顺利地进行公正工作的严重局势，并表明印度将继续贯彻它的中立政策来完成其在中立国遣返委员会中所承担的任务。同时，尼赫鲁总理要求美国应负责履行停战协定的各项条款。
    世界各国的正直人士，都在密切注视着美国及李承晚集团蓄意破坏停战协定、企图继续强迫扣留战俘的露骨罪行，认为及时遏止这些罪行，维护中立国遣返委员会的公正工作，是保证进一步和平解决朝鲜问题以巩固亚洲和世界和平的重要条件。光荣地担任中立国遣返委员会的主席和仲裁人的印度政府，对此表示特别的关切，乃是理所当然的事。
    中立国遣返委员会是由朝鲜交战双方的协议成立的，其职权范围也已在停战协定中作了明确的规定。最近以来，中立国遣返委员会关于对战俘的解释与访问工作，进行了一些必要的安排，例如通过了解释与访问工作细则、向战俘说明中立国遣返委员会的职权范围和战俘得有自由表达他们回家过和平生活的愿望的权利，以及责成双方提供为便利进行解释与访问工作所必需的场所和设备等等。所有这些安排，基本上都是符合于职权范围的规定的，并且是在中立国遣返委员会一致同意的基础上进行的。但是，对自己所签字的停战协定毫不尊重的美方，公然对目前中立国遣返委员会的公正工作施行蛮横无理的攻击、诬蔑和恫吓。当它对中立国遣返委员会连续提出的所谓抗议和无理要求未能达到目的时，竟更加恼怒起来。一贯为美国所纵容的李承晚集团竟扬言要使用武力劫走在中立国遣返委员会印度部队看管下的战俘，并且叫嚣要“把印度部队从朝鲜赶出去”。同时，美方仍在继续无理拖延修筑解释场所，加紧指使李蒋特务在战俘营中进行恐怖控制、发动骚乱和制造“集体逃亡”，以图彻底破坏中立国遣返委员会的工作，并把这个委员会从朝鲜赶出去或者挤出去，以便借此来达到其强迫扣留战俘的目的。
    很明显，中立国遣返委员会之所以横遭美方的攻忤，只是因为中立国遣返委员会正在努力想执行“职权范围”的公正工作，而这样的公正工作不合乎美方的口胃，不利于美方继续强迫扣留战俘。人们看到，一方面美方总司令克拉克在向中立国遣返委员会提出的所谓抗议信中，公开要求中立国遣返委员会接受美方早已破产的所谓我方被俘人员业已“选择”“不愿遣返”的可耻谎言；另一方面，美方又竭力反对对战俘进行个别解释和访问，企图指使蒋李特务胁迫我方被俘人员不到场接受解释和访问，并毫无根据地声言战俘可以不接受解释和访问。直到现在，美方还是不肯提供足够的解释场所使我方能对战俘开始全面解释工作，同时他们又极端横暴地拒绝将解释时间顺延以便我方能按照协定有九十天进行解释。美方这种对职权范围任意歪曲和破坏、企图破坏中立国遣返委员会的整个安排的计谋，其不可告人的目的何在，是三尺孩童都能识破的。如果中立国遣返委员会顺从了美国的这种计谋，那末，中立国遣返委员会就势必彻头彻尾地成为美方和李承晚、蒋介石集团合谋强迫扣留战俘的工具了。这显然是绝对不可能为任何一个有自尊心的中立国家所接受的。
    美方对中立国遣返委员会采取的这种无理态度，再一次暴露了美方对待中立国的粗暴的抹煞、蔑视和嘲弄的态度。美方一贯横行霸道，妄自尊大，随时任意破坏自己的诺言和自己签字的国际协议，敌视任何的和平动机与努力。即使中立国遣返委员会是经双方协议邀请出来为不直接遣返战俘的遣返工作从事公正的服务的，但美方也竟认为它是不应该公正的，而应该听从美方的发号施令，任意摆布。在美方的所谓“实力政策”之下，所有不愿为美国的侵略政策服务而愿为和平服务的国家，美国就不承认他们为中立国，就要百般诬蔑他们，压迫他们，甚至企图赶走他们；美国仅仅允许对它的侵略政策唯命是听、放弃中立立场的国家的活动。正是因为这样，美国对政治会议的成员问题也拒绝中立国家参加，而坚持主张只有朝鲜交战的国家才有资格参加。美国之所以嫉视真正中立的国家，正足以证明美国自知其蛮横无理，自知其阴谋破坏和加强国际紧张局势的活动见不得人。如果不是这样，那末，美国就应该欢迎中立国家的正当活动，为什么会害怕和排斥中立国家有机会来为和平事业服务呢？
    与美国的无理态度完全相反，朝中方面认为，中立国遣返委员会根据停战双方所同意的“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”来行使它的职责，是绝对应该和必须被尊重的。
    “中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第一款规定：设立中立国遣返委员会的目的，是为了“保证全部战俘在停战之后有机会行使其被遣返的权利”；第八款规定：中立国遣返委员会在接管全部未行使其被遣返权利的战俘之后，使战俘所属国家有自由与便利，“向一切依附于该所属国家的战俘解释他们的权利，并通知他们任何有关他们回返家乡的事项，特别是他们有回家过和平生活的完全自由”。第三款又规定对战俘“不得使用武力或以武力威胁以阻挠或强使其遣返”。显然，中立国遣返委员会根据职权范围规定的这种基本精神，它应该具有充分行使其职责的自由和权力，美方不得加以干扰。因此，“职权范围”是中立国遣返委员会执行其职责的唯一标准，也是衡量它是不是真正中立的唯一标准。印度总理尼赫鲁在他的演说中说：“就印度来说，我们的原则是：我们将不偏不倚，不受任何人的影响。我们是一个独立的国家，而且我们的政策也将是独立的政策。”“我们将继续不偏不倚地做我们的工作。”一切愿望和平解决朝鲜问题的人所要求于印度和其他中立国的，正是这种不偏不倚执行“职权范围”的立场。
    为使“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”不受破坏，保证一切未被直接遣返的战俘有机会行使他们被遣返回家过和平生活的权利，我们认为一切在中立国看管下的战俘，都必须由战俘所属国家代表对他们进行充分的解释，根据“职权范围”的规定，告诉他们可以回家过和平生活，这样才是真正地“尊重战俘的个人意志”。为了保证对战俘进行必要的解释，使他们能够行使被遣返的权利，就必须将解释期限顺延，使九十天的解释期限不被侵占或削减。美方一方面在修建解释场所的问题上一再拖延，一面又不同意顺延九十天的解释期限就是有计划地阴谋破坏职权范围的这一中心环节，就是企图完全剥夺对战俘进行解释的权利，也就是企图完全剥夺战俘表达他们被遣返回家过和平生活的权利。如果美国继续这样胡闹下去，并因此而将中立国遣返委员会挤出朝鲜，而这就必须被认为是美方破坏朝鲜停战的严重罪行。
    在美方这种任意拖延和破坏解释工作进行的情况下，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队在执行其任务时所面临的困难是很显然的。全世界一切爱好和平与渴望朝鲜问题和平解决的人民，都在同情中立国遣返委员会所进行的公正工作。只有和平的敌人才会对于中立国遣返委员会采取蛮不讲理的态度。一切和平的拥护者应该支持印度和中立国遣返委员会坚持遵守“职权范围”的公正工作。和平的力量一定能够战胜战争势力。
