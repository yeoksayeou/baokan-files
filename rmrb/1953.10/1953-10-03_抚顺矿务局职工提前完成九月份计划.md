    Under the wise leadership of the Party and yourself, all the workers of our Fushun Mining Bureau, through the campaign of increasing production and practicing economy, strengthening planned management and establishing a responsibility system, have displayed a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm and have completed the national production plan for September four days ahead of schedule, achieving 117.2 percent of the target.
