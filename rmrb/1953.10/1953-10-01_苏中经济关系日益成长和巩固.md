This summer, as a result of talks held in Moscow, the Soviet Union and China signed an agreement on Soviet assistance to China in developing its national economy. This agreement marks a new stage in the development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. It reflects the unwavering will of the two governments to continuously strengthen the fraternal friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China and to redouble their efforts to defend world peace. The solid foundation for the development of friendly relations between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China was laid on February 14, 1950. At that time, after talks between the two governments in Moscow, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Port Arthur and Dalian, and the Agreement on the Soviet Government's Loan to the People's Republic of China for the Purchase of Industrial and Railway Equipment from the Soviet Union were signed.

The Chinese people are welcoming the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. With confidence, the Chinese people are advancing along the road of building a new life. Through their selfless labor, they have made great achievements in restoring and developing the national economy, consolidating independence, and uniting all nationalities of China. The Chinese people have consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship and its foundation—the worker-peasant alliance. The land reform, which was the greatest socio-economic transformation carried out under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, meant that the most reactionary force in China—the landlord class—was eliminated as a class, and that hundreds of millions of Chinese peasants were liberated from cruel feudal exploitation, shaking off poverty and a position without rights. In the vast areas with approximately 450 million agricultural population, land has been returned to the tillers. Since the establishment of the people's government, China's agricultural production has not only fully recovered, but also exceeded the highest levels of the past. The production of important industrial crops such as cotton has tripled. The achievements made by the Chinese people in industry are also brilliant. The level of industrial production in People's China has greatly exceeded the pre-war level. Important products such as steel rails, mining equipment, universal milling machines and universal lathes, and transformers, which used to be imported from foreign countries, can now be manufactured domestically. The state-owned economic component, which is the economic foundation of the people's democratic system, has been developed and consolidated. In 1952, the products of state-owned industrial enterprises accounted for more than 60 percent of the total national industrial output.

The extensive economic and cultural ties between the Soviet Union and China have played an important role in the achievements of the Chinese people. Mutually beneficial trade, scientific and technological assistance, cooperation in developing the national economy and training cadres, and the exchange of production experience—these are the basic guidelines for the growing fraternal ties between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China. In 1950, the Soviet Union provided China with a long-term loan on preferential terms so that China could obtain equipment from the Soviet Union to restore and build new industrial enterprises. In 1952, the Soviet Union transferred the Chinese Changchun Railway to China free of charge. As reported in Chinese newspapers, it is currently one of the better railways in the country. In the cause of China's industrial recovery, the Soviet Union is providing technical assistance to China by designing and supplying equipment for metallurgical, power, coal mining, chemical, automotive, textile and other industrial enterprises. Soviet engineers are helping Chinese specialists become familiar with advanced labor methods and production management methods. They have helped many enterprises tap their potential, resulting in a significant increase in their productivity in a short period of time. For example, as a result of adopting new coal mining methods recommended by Soviet experts and equipping mines with first-class equipment supplied by the Soviet Union, Chinese miners have more than doubled their coal output. Soviet experts have helped China discover new oil deposits, refuting the nonsense that China lacks oil deposits.

The achievements of Chinese industry and agriculture have created favorable conditions for People's China to enter a new stage of economic development, a stage of large-scale economic construction according to the First Five-Year Plan. The main task of the First Five-Year Plan for Economic Construction of the People's Republic of China is to concentrate efforts on building China's heavy industry and ensuring the continuous growth of the proportion of socialist components in the national economy. The magnitude of the tasks of China's First Five-Year Plan can be seen from the following facts alone: In 1953 alone, it is planned to rebuild and build twenty-one new metallurgical and chemical plants, twenty-four large machine-building plants, twenty-four thermal and hydroelectric power plants, and railway lines with a total length of more than six hundred kilometers.

The Sino-Soviet agreement signed not long ago is aimed at helping China economically and technically to realize its First Five-Year Plan. The agreement stipulates that the Soviet Union will design and supply equipment for the construction and reconstruction of ninety-one new enterprises and the fifty enterprises that are being built and reconstructed, as well as provide other technical assistance.

Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, wrote in a telegram of thanks to G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, that with the signing of this agreement, "the Chinese people will be able to gradually establish their own powerful heavy industry by learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and the latest technological achievements. This will be extremely important for China's industrialization, the gradual transition of China to socialism, and the strengthening of the forces of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union."

The expansion of the metallurgical industry base makes it possible for the Chinese people to extensively develop the machine manufacturing industry and railway transportation industry. The agreement stipulates that large-scale iron and steel companies will be built in Daye and Baotou. After these factories go into production, China's steel production will increase by about four times that of 1952, and steel production will increase by more than two and a half times. China will produce super-grade steel for the first time. In terms of non-ferrous metals, it is stipulated that the production of aluminum in Fushun should be greatly expanded. After the renovation of Gejiu Tin Company, the production capacity will be more than doubled. The exploitation and processing of non-ferrous metals and rare metals will be widely mechanized instead of the current "laborious" manual labor. The new large coal mines and ore dressing plants stipulated in the agreement can increase coal production by 60%, and at the same time improve the quality. By adopting the latest Soviet-supplied equipment and the extremely rich experience of Soviet oil workers, China's oil production and refining capacity can be greatly increased. It is planned to build a large-scale oil refinery in Gansu Province, which will increase the production capacity of China's refining industry several times after it starts production. In order to ensure the power supply for industrial enterprises under construction, it is stipulated to greatly expand several existing thermal and hydroelectric power plants, and build new thermal and hydroelectric power plants. The power plants to be expanded include: the largest Fengman Hydropower Station on the Songhua River, and the large thermal power plants in Fushun, Fuxin, Harbin, Dalian and other cities. Among the new power plants under construction, the thermal power plants in Taiyuan, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Daye and Baotou should be mentioned. After these power plants generate electricity, China's total power volume will increase by about two times that of 1952. The People's Republic of China is formulating a long-term national electrification plan. And pay special attention to making full use of China's abundant hydropower resources, especially hydropower resources such as the Yellow River and the Han River. Soviet experts will participate in the formulation of this plan. The government of the People's Republic of China has been carrying out tremendous work on the Huai River since 1949, building sluices and other water conservancy projects to protect fields and cities from floods. However, the problem of harnessing the Yellow River and utilizing the Yellow River's water power has not yet been fully resolved. Soviet experts will help Chinese experts formulate plans for the utilization of the Yellow River based on the results of the study of long-term collected materials, and determine the order of building hydropower stations on the Yellow River. An important link in China's industrialization will be the establishment of a domestic machine manufacturing industry that can guarantee the supply of means of production to various sectors of the national economy. The agreement stipulates the expansion and renovation of existing machine manufacturing factories and the construction of dozens of new enterprises. In this way, People's China will have such machine manufacturing departments as: automobile, tractor and ball bearing manufacturing industries, departments producing rolling mills and melting furnaces, and electric machinery manufacturing industries. After the two new factories start production, the production of metal cutting machines will increase to three and a half times that of 1952; after a new large factory starts production, the production of mining equipment will increase to about two times that of 1952. These new machine manufacturing factories will produce Soviet-style steam turbines with 12,000 kilowatt generators, and in the future will also produce powerful turbine units of 25,000 kilowatts and 50,000 kilowatts. Chinese electrical factories will begin to produce power circuit breakers and electrical equipment for automatic telephone exchanges. Many new chemical plants will be built to greatly meet the large needs of Chinese agriculture for fertilizers. China is now organizing the production of synthetic rubber for the first time in history, which is necessary for the domestic industry in rubber industrial products. The planning institutions of the People's Republic of China have stipulated to build some factories for the production of medicines.

In addition to Soviet design and supply of machinery, China can also receive technical assistance in construction, installation and start-up production. At the request of the government of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union will send a large number of Soviet experts to China to train China's own cadres for building new enterprises and using new enterprises. Many Chinese workers and engineering technicians will go to Soviet factories for production internships.

The new agreement is fully in line with the interests of the peoples of the Soviet Union and China. The Soviet Union will obtain raw materials and food grains needed by the Soviet Union from China as compensation for the Soviet Union's supply of equipment and other assistance to China. For example, the new agreement stipulates that China will supply the Soviet Union with non-ferrous metals, wool, jute, rice, pork, and tobacco. The development and expansion of Sino-Soviet economic ties proves that the unity and friendship of the great peoples of the Soviet Union and China are becoming more consolidated. There is no force in the world that can destroy the friendship between the Soviet Union and China. All peace-loving people in the world welcome the strengthening of this friendship and properly regard it as an important factor in maintaining and consolidating peace in the Far East and world peace. The Soviet people sincerely wish the People's Republic of China prosperity and strength, and sincerely wish that the great Sino-Soviet friendly alliance for consolidating peace and international security will be further strengthened.

    苏中经济关系日益成长和巩固
    苏联

    普·米赫耶夫
    今年夏天，在莫斯科举行会谈的结果，苏中两国签订了一个关于苏联援助中国发展国民经济的协定。这个协定标志着苏联和中华人民共和国间友好关系发展的新阶段。它反映出两国政府不断加强苏中两国人民的兄弟般友谊并加倍努力为保卫世界和平而斗争的不屈不挠的意志。苏中两国人民友好关系发展的巩固基础在一九五○年二月十四日就奠定下来了。当时经过两国政府在莫斯科会谈，签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约，关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定，关于苏联政府贷款给中华人民共和国以便从苏联购买工业和铁路装备的协定。
    中国人民正在迎接中华人民共和国成立四周年。中国人民满怀信心地沿着建设新生活的道路前进，他们以忘我的劳动在恢复和发展国家经济方面、在巩固独立方面、在团结中国各民族方面取得了巨大的成就。中国人民巩固了人民民主专政和它的基础——工农联盟。土地改革是在中国共产党领导下所进行的最伟大的社会经济改造，土地改革的实现，意味着中国最反动的势力——地主作为一个阶级被消灭了，意味着数亿中国农民从残酷的封建剥削下解放出来，摆脱贫困和没有权利的地位。在约有四亿五千万农业人口的广大地区，土地已经归耕者所有。自从人民政权建立以来，中国的农业生产不仅完全恢复了，而且超过了过去最高的水平。像棉花这一重要的工业作物的生产已增加为三倍。中国人民在工业方面所取得的成绩也是辉煌的。人民中国的工业生产水平已大大地超过了战前的水平。像钢轨、采矿设备、万能铣床和万能车床、变压器这些过去由外国输入的重要产品现在已能自己制造。作为人民民主制度的经济基础的国营经济成份已经发展和巩固了。一九五二年，国营工业企业的产品占全国工业产品总产量百分之六十强。
    苏中两国广泛的经济和文化联系对中国人民的成就起了重要的作用。互利的贸易、科学技术援助、在发展国民经济和培养干部方面的合作、生产经验的交流——这就是苏中两国人民日益增长的兄弟联系的基本方针。苏联于一九五○年在优惠的条件下贷给中国以长期的贷款，以便中国从苏联获得恢复和新建工业企业的设备。一九五二年，苏联将中国长春铁路无偿地移交给中国。正如中国报纸所报道的，它是目前全国较好的一条铁路。苏联在中国恢复工业的事业中，通过设计和供应冶金、动力、采煤、化学、汽车、纺织及其他工业企业的设备来对中国作技术上的援助。苏联工程师帮助中国的专门人材熟悉先进的劳动方法和生产管理方法。他们帮助许多企业发掘潜力，使得在短期内显著地提高了它们的生产率。例如，由于采用苏联专家建议的新的采煤方法并以苏联供应的头等设备装备矿场，结果中国矿工使采煤量增加了一倍半。苏联专家帮助中国发现了新的石油矿藏，推翻所谓中国缺乏石油矿藏的胡说。
    中国工农业的成就，为人民中国转入经济发展的新的阶段，转入根据第一个五年计划进行大规模的经济建设阶段创造了有利条件。中华人民共和国经济建设的第一个五年计划的主要任务是集中力量来建立中国的重工业和保证国民经济中社会主义成份的比重不断增长。中国第一个五年计划的任务之宏大单从下面的事实就可以看出来：仅仅在一九五三年一年中，规定改建和新建二十一个冶金和化学工厂，二十四个大机器制造厂，二十四个火力发电厂和水力发电厂，全长六百公里以上的铁路线。
    不久以前签订的中苏协定，就是要在经济上和技术上帮助中国实现第一个五年计划。这个协定规定由苏联进行设计并对建设和改建九十一个新的企业以及正在建设和改建的五十个企业供给设备以及给予其他各种技术援助。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东在致苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫的谢电中写道，由于这一协定的签定，“中国人民将能够在学习苏联的先进经验和最新技术成就的努力之下，逐步地建立起自己的强大的重工业，这对于中国工业化、使中国逐步地过渡到社会主义和壮大以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，都具有极其重大的作用。”
    冶金业基础的扩大，使中国人民有可能广泛地发展机器制造业和铁路运输业。协定规定，要在大冶和包头两地建造规模庞大的钢铁公司。这些工厂开工生产后，中国的钢产量将增加为一九五二年的四倍左右，钢材产量增加为二倍半以上。中国将第一次生产特等钢。在有色金属方面规定要大大扩大抚顺的铝的生产。个旧的锡业公司改建后，生产能力将增加为两倍强。有色金属和稀有金属的开采和加工都将广泛采用机器来代替现在的“吃力”的手工劳动。协定中规定建设的新的大煤矿和选矿工场可以使煤产量提高百分之六十，同时还可以改进质量。采用苏联供应的最新式的设备以及采用苏联石油工人的极其丰富的经验，就可以使中国的石油产量和炼油量大大地提高。计划在甘肃省内建造一个规模庞大的炼油工厂，它开始生产后将使中国炼油工业的生产能力提高好几倍。为了保证建设中的工业企业的电力供应，规定大大扩大若干现有的火力和水力发电厂，并建设新的火力和水力发电厂。要扩大的发电厂中包括：最大的松花江上的丰满水力发电厂，抚顺、阜新、哈尔滨、大连和其他城市的大火力发电厂。新建中的发电厂中应当提到的是太原、西安、兰州、大冶和包头的火力发电厂。这些发电厂发电后，中国的电力总量将增加为一九五二年的两倍左右。中华人民共和国正在制定一个全国电气化的长远计划。而且特别注意充分利用中国丰富的水力资源，特别是像黄河和汉水这样的水力资源。苏联专家将参加这个计划的制订工作。中华人民共和国政府从一九四九年起就一直在淮河上进行巨大的工作，建筑水闸和其他保护田地和城市免遭水灾的水利工程。然而，治理黄河和利用黄河水力的问题还没有得到全盘的解决。苏联专家将根据研究长期搜集起来的材料的结果帮助中国专家制定利用黄河的计划，并确定在黄河上建筑水电站的次序。中国工业化的重要环节将是建立能够保证供应国民经济各部门以生产工具的本国机器制造业。协定规定扩大并改建现有的机器制造工厂，建设数十个新的企业。这样，人民中国就将有这样的机器制造部门，如：汽车、拖拉机和滚珠轴承制造工业，生产压延机和熔铁炉的部门，电动机器制造业等。两个新建的工厂开始生产后，金属切削机的生产将增加为一九五二年的三倍半；一个新的大工厂开始生产后，采矿设备的生产将增加为一九五二年的二倍左右。这些新的机器制造工厂将出产苏联式样的带有一万二千瓩发电机的蒸气透平，今后还要生产二万五千瓩和五万瓩的强力的透平机组。中国各电器工厂将开始生产电力断路器、自动电话交换台用的电气器材。将建造许多新的化学工厂来大大满足中国农业对肥料的大量需要。中国现在正在组织有史以来的第一次人造橡胶的生产，这种橡胶是本国工业在橡胶工业制品中所必需的。中华人民共和国的计划机构已规定建造一些生产药品的工厂。
    除去苏联进行设计和供给机器外，中国还可以在建设、安装和开工生产等方面得到技术上的帮助。根据中华人民共和国政府的请求，苏联将遣派大批苏联专家到中国去培养中国自己的建设新企业和使用新企业的干部。许多中国的工人和工程技术人员将到苏联工厂中进行生产实习。
    新的协定完全符合于苏中两国人民的利益。苏联将由中国取得苏联所需要的原料和商品粮食，以作为苏联供给中国设备和其他各种援助的报偿。例如，新协定中规定中国将以有色金属、羊毛、黄麻、大米、猪肉、烟草供应苏联。苏中经济联系的发展和扩大证明：苏中两国伟大人民的团结和友好是更加巩固了。世界上没有一种力量能够破坏苏中的友谊。世界各国爱好和平的人民都欢迎这种友谊的加强，把它恰当地看成是维护和巩固远东和平和世界和平的重要因素。苏联人民谨祝中华人民共和国繁荣昌盛，谨祝我们两国人民、为了巩固和平和国际安全的伟大的中苏友好同盟获得进一步的加强。
