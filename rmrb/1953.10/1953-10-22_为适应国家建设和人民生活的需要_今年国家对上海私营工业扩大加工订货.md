    To meet the rising needs of national construction and the people's livelihood, and to ensure a more planned supply, the state has made planned expansions to processing orders for Shanghai's private industry this year. By the end of July, 6,230 private factories in Shanghai had accepted state processing orders. Among them, 3,670 were large and medium-sized factories with 16 or more people and handicraft workshops with 31 or more people in 64 major industries, accounting for more than 78 percent of the total number of these larger and medium-sized private factories and workshops. In July and August, the quantity of processing, ordering, exclusive sales, and purchases of 57 major products produced by Shanghai's private industry accounted for more than 80 percent of their output for 24 products, 60 to 80 percent for 20 products, and less than 40 percent for only 5 products. Currently, processing orders are still being expanded. By the fourth quarter of this year, all or most of the famous brands and superior goods among the various major department store items produced by private factories will be controlled by the state. This will ensure that most of the major industrial products produced by Shanghai's private industry will no longer go through the blind free market but will be supplied to people all over the country by the state in a planned manner.
    This year's state processing orders for Shanghai's private industry are carried out in a planned manner based on the needs of national construction and consumers. In processing orders, the state also rationally allocates raw materials and semi-finished products, and organizes the production of dispersed factories in a planned way to avoid the destruction of the free market. At present, in Shanghai's private heavy industrial factories, many factories that could only manufacture textile machinery parts in the past have been transformed to manufacture machine tools. Some machinery factories and iron factories have begun to develop in the direction of specialization. Many private light industrial factories, according to changes in people's needs, have improved product varieties, specifications, output, and designs, and then signed processing order contracts with state-owned trade departments.
    Due to the planned arrangements made by the state for processing orders for private factories, the proportion of long-term processing, ordering, and exclusive sales is very large this year. In the private dyeing and weaving industry, 128 factories that did not have exclusive sales in June this year had signed long-term exclusive sales contracts with the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company in August. All of the commodities purchased by the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Department Store Company in the first half of 1951 were temporary purchases. In 1952, the amount of temporary purchases still accounted for 53.98 percent of the total purchase amount. In the third quarter of this year, the temporary purchase portion has been reduced to 16.49 percent, while the proportion of exclusive sales, ordering, and processing has reached 83.51 percent. By expanding the control of private factory products through planned processing orders and exclusive sales, the state not only greatly strengthens the leading force of the state-owned economy in the market but also enables private industry to gradually embark on the path of planned development under the unified leadership of the state.
    Now is the peak season for the market. Relevant state-owned economic departments in Shanghai are helping private factories in Shanghai that produce good quality products and are in great demand for national construction and people's livelihood to solve difficulties in raw materials, electricity, and equipment, so that they can increase production under the unified leadership of the state.

    为适应国家建设和人民生活的需要
    今年国家对上海私营工业扩大加工订货
    为适应国家建设和人民生活日益上升的需要，保证更有计划地供应，今年国家对上海私营工业的加工订货作了有计划地扩大。到七月底止，上海全市私营工厂接受国家加工订货的已有六千二百三十家。其中有六十四个主要行业十六人以上的大、中型工厂和三十一人以上的手工作坊有三千六百七十家，占这些较大、中型私营工厂、作坊总数的百分之七十八以上。七、八两月中，国家对上海私营工业生产的五十七种主要产品的加工、订货、包销、收购数量占其产量百分之八十以上的有二十四种，占百分之六十到八十的有二十种，国家掌握不到百分之四十的只有五种。目前加工订货还在扩大，到今年第四季度，私营工厂出产的各种主要百货中的名牌货、上等货，都将全部，或极大部分为国家所掌握，这样将使上海私营工业出产的大部分主要工业品不再通过盲目的自由市场，而由国家有计划地供应全国各地人民。
    今年国家对上海私营工业的加工订货，是根据国家建设的需要和消费者的需要有计划地进行的。在加工订货中，国家还通过合理的分配原料和半成品，有计划地组织生产分散的工厂，使他们的生产避免自由市场的破坏。目前在上海私营重工业工厂中，许多过去只能制造纺织机件的工厂已改制工作母机，有的机器厂、铁工厂并已开始向专业化方向发展。许多私营轻工业工厂，根据人民需要的变化，改进了产品品种、规格、产量、花色，然后和国营贸易部门签订了加工订货合约。
    由于国家对私营工厂加工订货作了有计划的安排，今年长期的加工、订货、包销比重很大。私营染织业中今年六月份还没有包销的工厂，八月份和中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站订立长期包销合约的已有一百二十八家。中国百货公司上海采购供应站一九五一年上半年购进的商品全部是临时采购的。一九五二年内，临时采购的商品金额还占进货总金额的百分之五十三点九八，今年第三季度进货金额中，临时采购部分已缩小到百分之十六点四九，而包销、订货、加工所占比重已达百分之八十三点五一。国家通过有计划的加工订货和包销的方式，扩大对私营工厂产品的掌握，不仅使国营经济在市场上的领导力量大大增强，同时也使私营工业有可能逐步在国家的统一领导下走上有计划地发展的道路。
    现在正值市场旺季，上海市各有关国营经济部门正在帮助上海那些产品质量好的，而又为国家建设和人民生活所大量需要的私营工厂解决原料、电力、设备等方面的困难，使他们在国家的统一领导下增加生产。    （新华社）
