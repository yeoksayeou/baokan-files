    A Trade Company Serving Ethnic Minorities
    Fang Chengjie
    In order to improve the lives of people in ethnic minority areas, the Qinghai Yushu Trading Branch, in conjunction with local ethnic customs, vigorously purchased agricultural and pastoral native and special products, and fully supplied the daily necessities of farmers and herdsmen, effectively strengthening the supply of means of production in ethnic minority areas.
    In order to facilitate the purchase of goods and sale of local products for herdsmen, the Yushu Trading Branch, in addition to establishing fixed trading organizations in Yushu, Chengduo, Nangqian and other places, also equipped more than 20 cadres and organized six mobile groups including Geji, Youxiu, Kala, and Niancuo, carrying goods worth 3.5 billion yuan such as cloth and general merchandise. They departed in mid-May 1952 and returned successively until March 1953. The mobile groups traveled throughout the areas inhabited by the six tribes of Geji in Yushu County, the four tribes of Youxiu, the five tribes of Zhongba, Sujie, Dongba, Bangcha, and Baqin in Nangqian County, and the six tribes of Shangxia Niancuo, Bairi Maima, Bairi Duoma, Xiuma, and Kala in Chengduo County. The farthest places, such as Jiangyang Zhaxi and Yala, were more than 1,000 li away from Jiegu City, where the district was located, and the nearest were also more than 300 li away from Jiegu City. Each time the mobile group arrived at a place, they often held mass forums to publicize trade policies, introduce commodity varieties, and directly exchange materials with the vast number of herdsmen. During these nine months, they sold a total of more than 3.3 billion yuan worth of homespun cloth, coarse cloth, Xikang tea, highland barley, and other general merchandise. The total value of wool, various hides, caterpillar fungus, musk, anemarrhena, and other local products produced by the vast number of herdsmen that were purchased was 3.9 billion yuan. Because of the fair transactions of the mobile trade group, they were well received by the masses. For example, Panangjia from Bairi Duoma in Chengduo County said, "The private merchants from Xiangride (place name in Dulan County), such as Xieshisen, did business here based on who they knew. Now that the trade company has come, they sell to everyone, regardless of whether they are rich or poor, whatever they want to buy." Therefore, he sold all 800 jin of his wool to the mobile trade group. He also said to the trade group, "Please come earlier next year, I will definitely find a way to sell all our local products to you."
    Because the trade company vigorously carried out purchasing work deep in the pastoral areas, the herdsmen's local products found a broad sales market, and therefore their purchasing power also increased. This can be seen from the sales situation of the Yushu branch: the sales volume in 1952 increased by 326.64 percent compared with 1951. This can also be seen from the exchange ratio of industrial and agricultural products in the pastoral areas: before liberation, 100 jin of wool could only be exchanged for 2.5 packages of Xikang tea, but in 1952, 100 jin of wool could be exchanged for 10 packages of Xikang tea, greatly stimulating the production enthusiasm of the herdsmen. The amount of wool exported in 1951 increased by 102.5 percent compared with 1950, and increased by another 70.14 percent in 1952 compared with 1951. Therefore, the lives of the herdsmen are improving day by day. Before liberation, most people could not afford tea all year round, but now they all have tea to drink. In the past, the serf herdsmen had never seen fried noodles, but now they have fried noodles to eat during the New Year and festivals, and they also have money to buy cloth to make clothes. As an old lady on Heping Road in Jiegu City said, "Before liberation, local products were worthless. Our whole family worked hard all year round, but we still couldn't eat or dress well, and sometimes we were also subjected to beatings and scoldings by bandits. After liberation, Chairman Mao came, and local products had a market. This year, we can not only eat fried noodles and drink tea every day, but we also made a new brown robe for each person, and made shirts for each of the two children."

    一个为少数民族服务的贸易公司
    方承杰
    青海玉树贸易分公司为了改善少数民族地区人民的生活，结合当地民族生活习惯，大力收购了农牧民土、特产品，充分供应了农牧民日用必需品，有力地加强了少数民族地区生产资料的供应工作。
    玉树贸易分公司为了便于牧民购货与出售土产，除了在玉树、称多、囊谦等地设立固定贸易机构外，并配备干部二十多人，组织格吉、优秀、喀啦、念错等六个流动小组，携带价值三十五亿元的布匹、百货等，于一九五二年五月中旬出发，直到一九五三年三月才先后返回。流动小组曾走遍玉树县格吉六族，优秀四族，囊谦县中坝、苏芥、东巴、邦查、巴钦五族，和称多县上下念错、白日麦麻、白日多麻、休麻、喀啦六族所居住的地区，最远的如江羊扎西、雅拉等地离分区所在地的结古市有一千多华里，最近的也离结古市三百多华里。流动组每到一个地方，经常召开群众座谈会，宣传贸易政策，介绍商品品种，直接与广大牧民进行了物资交换。在这九个多月当中，共推销土布、大布、西康大茶、青稞及其他百货等，价值三十三亿多元。收进广大牧民所生产的羊毛、各种皮张、虫草、麝香、知母及其他土产等总值三十九亿元。由于流动贸易组公平交易，得到了群众的好评。例如称多县白日多麻爬囊加说：“香日得（都兰县地名）来的私商谢世森，在我们这里是看面子作买卖，贸易公司来了，不管穷富，要买什么都卖给什么。”因此他把八百斤羊毛全部卖给流动贸易组。并对贸易组说：“明年你们早点来吧，我一定想办法把我们的土产全部卖给你们。”
    由于贸易公司大力深入牧区进行收购工作，使牧民的土产找到了广阔的销路，因此购买力也就跟着提高。从玉树分公司的销售情况就可以看出：一九五二年销售额比一九五一年增加百分之三百二十六点六四。从牧区工农产品交换比例也可以看出：解放前一百斤羊毛只能换西康大茶二包半，到了一九五二年每百斤羊毛可换到西康大茶十包，大大地刺激了牧民生产情绪。一九五一年向外输出的羊毛，比一九五○年增加百分之一百零二点五，一九五二年比一九五一年又增加百分之七十点一四，因此牧民生活一天一天在改善。解放前，大部分人终年吃不上茶叶，现在都吃到了茶叶。过去帐房牧民根本没有见过炒面，现在过年过节都吃到了炒面，还有钱买布匹做衣服。正如结古市和平路一位老太太说：“解放前土产不值钱，我们全家终年劳动，还是吃不上、穿不上，有时还要遭受马匪打骂。解放后，毛主席来了，土产有了销路，今年我们不但天天能吃上炒面，喝上茶叶，而且每人做了一件新褐衫，给二个小孩每人做了衬衣。”
