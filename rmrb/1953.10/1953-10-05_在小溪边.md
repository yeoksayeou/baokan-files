　　I went to the stream to fetch water with my water jar on my head.
　　A volunteer soldier was washing clothes by the stream with his head lowered.
　　I saw his hands were red from rubbing.
　　Although I was shy, I said to him:
　　“Let me help you wash!
　　Let me help you wash!”
　　I went to the stream to fetch water with my water jar on my head.
　　A volunteer soldier was holding a rice basket and washing rice.
　　I saw beads of sweat on his forehead.
　　Although I was shy, I said to him:
　　“Let me help you wash the rice!
　　Let me help you wash the rice!”
　　I went to the stream to fetch water with my water jar on my head.
　　Several volunteer soldiers were sitting by the stream resting.
　　When they saw me, they greeted me warmly:
　　“Girl fetching water, sing a song!”
　　Although I was shy, I sang happily,
　　After singing "Song of Spring" I sang "Beside the Rakdong River".

    在小溪边
    朝鲜民歌  杨立本编译我顶着水罐到溪边汲水，一位志愿军低头在水边洗衣。我看他两手搓的通红，
  虽然害羞可是向他说了：
  “我帮你洗吧！
    我帮你洗吧！”我顶着水罐到溪边汲水，一位志愿军扶着米筐在淘米。我看他额上冒出了汗珠，
  虽然害羞可是向他说了：
  “我帮你淘吧！
    我帮你淘吧！”我顶着水罐到溪边汲水，几位志愿军坐在溪边休息。看见我来了他们亲热地招呼：
  “汲水的姑娘，唱一支歌子吧！”我虽然害羞可是愉快地唱了，
  唱完“春天之歌”又唱“洛东江边”。
