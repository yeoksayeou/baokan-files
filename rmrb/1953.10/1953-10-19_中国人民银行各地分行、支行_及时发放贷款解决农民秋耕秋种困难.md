People's Bank of China Branches and Sub-branches in Various Regions
Promptly Issue Loans to Solve Farmers' Difficulties in Autumn Plowing and Planting

    Currently, autumn plowing and planting are underway in rural areas across the country. To support farmers in planting wheat in a timely manner and strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year, branches, sub-branches, and business offices of the People's Bank of China in various regions, under the unified leadership of local Party committees and governments, have successively issued a batch of loans for wheat seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural tools to impoverished farmers.
    The Henan Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China used the loans recovered in the summer and the 190 billion yuan of seed loans additionally allocated by the People's Bank of China as autumn plowing and planting loans, instructing its subordinate branches to promptly issue loans based on the needs of the masses, mainly in areas affected by floods and wheat crop failures. The Hebei Provincial Branch allocated 90 billion yuan from production and disaster relief loans as wheat seed loans. The Anhui Provincial Branch issued 160 billion yuan in loans and jointly instructed county banks and grain departments with the province's Grain Bureau to do a good job in loan issuance and wheat seed supply. The Shandong Provincial Branch plans to issue wheat seed loans for 6 million mu of wheat fields.
    People's Bank of China sub-branches in various counties have successively gone deep into rural areas to carry out loan issuance work. Counties in Henan Province generally began issuing loans in early September, and most loans had been distributed to the masses by late September.
    The Shijiazhuang Special District Central Sub-branch issued a total of over 10.1 billion yuan in various agricultural loans from September 1st to 25th, an increase of two times compared to August. According to statistics from thirteen townships and eighty-nine villages in Jing County, Hebei Province, the over 120 million yuan in loans issued in mid-September were loaned to more than 1,800 households, which can ensure that farmers can plant wheat in a timely manner on more than 13,300 mu. The Yingshang County Sub-branch in Anhui Province issued 4 billion yuan in wheat seed loans, solving the wheat planting difficulties for over 285,000 mu of wheat fields. To avoid farmers not being able to buy wheat seeds even with money, the sub-branch contacted relevant departments to ensure that seeds were sold to farmers at any time. Li Liangfu Village and Beibian Wu Village in Anxin County, Hebei Province, were severely affected by disasters, and farmers urgently needed wheat seeds and fertilizers. The local People's Bank of China business office closely cooperated with cooperatives, promptly issuing loans of over 47 million yuan, helping 767 farmers buy wheat seeds and fertilizers, and expanding the wheat field area by 4,399 mu.
    To ensure that loans are issued to farmers who truly need them, People's Bank of China branches and sub-branches in many regions conducted key experiments and research before issuing loans. For example, cadres from the Nanyang Special District People's Bank of China and cooperative cadres jointly formed two working groups and went to disaster areas to understand the situation. The loans issued in this area were more in line with actual needs. To ensure that loans were not delayed and to facilitate farmers, cadres from the People's Bank of China in many regions brought loans to the countryside, simplified loan procedures, organized loan recipients to sign collective agreements, and made payments at any time, promptly solving the difficulties of the masses.
    However, the work of cadres in individual People's Bank of China regions was not thorough enough, and they generally called on the masses to report and apply for loans themselves, resulting in people with wheat seeds also applying for loans. Some places did not ask about the needs of the masses and distributed loans equally, and those who should not have received loans also received them. This phenomenon must be corrected immediately.

    中国人民银行各地分行、支行
    及时发放贷款解决农民秋耕秋种困难
    目前各地农村正在进行秋耕秋种。为支持农民适时种麦，争取明年小麦丰收，中国人民银行各地分行、支行、营业所，在当地党委、政府统一领导下，先后对贫困农民发放了一批麦种、肥料、农具等贷款。
    人民银行河南省分行将夏季收回的贷款和人民银行总行增拨的种籽贷款一千九百亿元，做为秋耕秋种贷款，指示所属支行主要在遭受水灾和小麦歉收地区，根据群众需要及时贷放。河北省分行从生产救灾贷款中拨出九百亿元做麦种贷款。安徽省分行发放了一千六百亿元贷款，并曾与该省粮食厅联合指示各县银行和粮食部门做好贷款与麦种供应工作。山东省分行计划贷放六百万亩麦田的麦种贷款。
    各县人民银行支行都已先后深入到农村，进行发放贷款工作。河南省各县一般于九月上旬开始贷放，九月下旬大部贷款已贷到群众手中。
    石家庄专区中心支行，从九月一日到二十五日共发放各种农业贷款一百零一亿余元，比八月份增加了两倍。河北省景县支行在九月中旬发放的一亿二千多万元贷款，据十三个乡八十九个村统计，就贷放了一千八百多户，可保证农民及时种麦一万三千三百余亩。安徽省颍上县支行贷放麦种贷款四十亿元，解决了二十八万五千余亩麦田的种麦困难。为了避免农民有了钱买不到麦种，该支行和有关部门联系，保证随时卖给农民种籽。河北省安新县李良甫庄和北边吴村受灾较重，农民迫切需要麦种、肥料。该地人民银行营业所和合作社密切配合，及时贷款四千七百多万元，帮助七百六十七户农民买到了麦种、肥料，扩大麦田面积四千三百九十九亩。
    为了使贷款发放给真正需要贷款的农民，许多地区的人民银行分行、支行，在贷款前进行了重点试验和调查研究工作。如河南省南阳专区人民银行干部和合作社干部共同组成两个工作组，曾到灾区了解情况。这一地区发放的贷款，就更加符合实际需要。为了使贷款不误农时，并便利农民，许多地区的人民银行干部带款下乡，并简化贷款手续，组织贷户集体立约，随时付款，及时解决群众困难。
    但是个别地区人民银行干部工作不深入，一般地号召群众自报申请贷款，结果有麦种的也贷了款。有的地方不问群众需要，一律平均分配，不该贷款的也贷到了款。这种现象必须立即纠正。
