    Introduction to the Thirty-Ninth Issue of the Chinese Edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!"
    The thirty-ninth issue of the Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" has been published.
    The focus of this issue is the report on the talks held in Moscow in mid-September between the delegations of the Soviet Government and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This issue publishes the full text of the communique issued by the two governments regarding the results of the talks, and the speeches delivered by G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, and Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, at the banquet in the Kremlin on September 19th. This issue also carries an editorial entitled "Striving for a Thorough and Peaceful Solution to the Korean Question," pointing out that peace-loving people around the world welcome the results of the talks between the Soviet and Korean government delegations with great satisfaction. The results of the talks will undoubtedly play a significant role in consolidating peace and security in the Far East and throughout the world. At the same time, the results of the talks further powerfully illustrate to mankind the consistency of the Soviet Union's foreign policy—a policy of international peace, friendship, and cooperation. In sharp contrast to the Soviet Union's policy of peace is the policy of international reactionary forces, especially the ruling groups in the United States. The ruling groups in the United States are attempting to undermine the Korean armistice and create a tense situation in Asia and the Pacific region. However, this policy of the United States has not taken into account the fundamental changes that have taken place in Asia and the Pacific region. Today, objective conditions enable the progressive forces in the East to turn Asia into a bulwark of peace. One of the most important of these objective conditions is the international prestige of the People's Republic of China and its policies.
    This issue publishes a telegram from Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of our country, to Comrade G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, expressing gratitude to the Soviet government for its assistance in China's economic construction. This issue also publishes an article by Li Fuchun entitled "How the People's Republic of China Develops Industrial Construction."
    This issue devotes considerable space to publishing the full text of Comrade N.S. Khrushchev's report at the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU on September 3rd: "On Measures for the Further Development of Agriculture in the Soviet Union."
    This issue also publishes an article by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, entitled "The 85th British Trades Union Congress." The article describes the fierce struggle waged by progressive British workers at this congress against the right-wing leadership of the trade unions, exposes the various conspiracies and tricks of the right-wing leadership in violating the basic principles of the trade union movement, and points out the policies followed by the progressive forces in the British trade unions in the struggle. This policy is to unite all workers, strive for higher wages, improve social services, develop East-West trade, and nationalize all important industrial sectors. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第三十九期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第三十九期中文版已经出版。
    本期的中心是报道苏联政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团九月中旬在莫斯科举行的会谈。本期刊载了两国政府发表的关于会谈结果的公报，苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国首相金日成九月十九日在克里姆林宫宴会上相继发表的讲话全文。本期并以“争取彻底和平解决朝鲜问题”为题发表社论指出，全世界爱好和平的人民都以极为满意的心情欢迎苏联和朝鲜两国政府代表团会谈的结果。会谈的结果无疑地将在巩固远东以及全世界和平与安全的事业中起巨大的作用。同时，会谈的结果进一步有力地向人类说明了苏联的外交政策——国际和平、友好与合作的政策——的一贯性。与苏联的和平政策恰恰相反的是国际反动势力、首先是美国统治集团的政策。美国统治集团正在企图破坏朝鲜停战，并在亚洲及太平洋区域造成紧张的局势。但是，美国这种政策没有考虑到亚洲和太平洋区域已经发生了根本的变化。今天，客观条件使东方的进步力量可以把亚洲变成和平堡垒。这些客观条件中最重要的一个条件是中华人民共和国的国际威望和它的政策。
    本期刊载了我国中央人民政府毛泽东主席致电苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫同志表示感谢苏联政府援助中国经济建设的电文。本期并刊载李富春撰写的“中华人民共和国怎样发展工业建设”一文。
    本期以大量篇幅全文刊载了尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志九月三日在苏共中央全体会议上的报告：“关于进一步发展苏联农业的措施”。
    本期还刊载了英国共产党总书记哈里·波立特撰写的“第八十五届英国职工大会”一文。文章叙述了英国进步工人在这届大会上和工会右翼领导集团进行的激烈斗争，揭露了工会右翼领导集团违反工会运动基本原则的种种阴谋和诡计，并且指出了英国工会中进步力量在斗争中所遵循的政策。这种政策就是团结全体工人，争取较高工资，改善社会服务事业，发展东西方贸易，使一切重要工业部门都国有化。（新华社）
