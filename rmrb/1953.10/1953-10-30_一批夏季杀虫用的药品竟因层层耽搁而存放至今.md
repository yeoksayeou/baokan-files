    A Batch of Summer Insecticides Has Been Stored Until Now Due to Layer Upon Layer of Delays

    Jiang Liu of the CCP Zhejiang Haiyan County Committee writes: The Haiyan County Environmental Sanitation Center is storing 288 jin of DDT and 2,850 jin of 666 powder. This batch of drugs was issued by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, instructing that it be used in June and July to kill mosquitoes, flies, fleas, etc. However, the Provincial Department of Health did not issue a notice to the counties until late July, and the drugs were not allocated to Haiyan until early September. When the County Health Section and the County Environmental Sanitation Center received the notice to use this batch of drugs, both sides said they were busy, and pushed it back and forth. A usage plan had not been made even after two months. This batch of powder has just been stored away after allocation. The Zhejiang Provincial People's Government Health Department and the Haiyan County People's Government Health Section and Environmental Sanitation Center have such low administrative efficiency that the drugs cannot be used in a timely manner, which is very wrong.

    一批夏季杀虫用的药品竟因层层耽搁而存放至今
    中共浙江海宁县委会江流来信：海宁县环境卫生所存放着二百八十八斤滴滴涕和二千八百五十斤六六六药粉。这批药物是中央人民政府卫生部发下来，指示在六、七月间杀蚊、蝇、蚤等用的。但省卫生厅在七月下旬才向各县发通知，到九月初才把药品拨到海宁。县卫生科与县环境卫生所接到使用这批药品的通知时，双方都说忙，彼此一推，使用计划两个月都还没有作出。这批药粉拨到后就这样存放着。浙江省人民政府卫生厅和海宁县人民政府卫生科、环境卫生所行政效率这样低，使药品不能及时使用，这是非常不应该的。
