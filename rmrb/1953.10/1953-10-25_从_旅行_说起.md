    Starting from "Travel"
    Jin Zhiguang
    There is an old Chinese saying: "Read ten thousand books, travel ten thousand miles," which shows that travel can indeed increase one's knowledge a lot. This is not only true for ordinary people; even for those Wall Street bosses who have been blinded by "high profits," "travel" may not be able to sober them up.
    U.S. Vice President Nixon is currently on his "Far East trip." When he arrived in Melbourne, Australia, on October 17, he was not greeted by welcoming crowds but by protesting masses. The people of Melbourne posted slogans and distributed leaflets everywhere, asking this "cunning fellow" to get out. This head-on blow from the people of Melbourne cannot be said to be a good lesson for American politicians who are plotting to win over "allies" in the Pacific to form an aggressive bloc. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Sydney, Nixon himself admitted that most of the Australians he met opposed the rearmament of Japan.
    U.S. Democratic Senator Lehman recently visited Britain, France, and Italy. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Chicago on October 11, Lehman discovered during this trip: "Among the people of Europe, the prestige of the United States has never been as low as it is now." Lehman said: "Many people in Europe regard us (the United States) as a country shrouded in the shadow of domestically produced fascism, and they believe that the American people are completely trapped in a state of fear, panic, and hysteria." What has made the "prestige" of the United States in Europe fall to a "heartbreaking" level? A Reuters dispatch from New York on October 6 said that Lehman admitted that it was something that represents mad war cries and fascist rule—McCarthyism. Lehman said: "I think McCarthyism is a great threat to our country, our freedom, and our civil rights."
    Back in April and May of this year, Weir, the chairman of "National Steel Corporation," president of the "American Iron and Steel Institute," and vice chairman of the Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce, also made his fifth visit to Europe since the end of World War II. In his "Impressions of European Travel," Weir talked about the Western European people's desire for peace and their opposition to war. He bluntly said that the people of Western European countries, who have suffered from war, "desire peace above all else. There is no doubt about this." "They are unwilling to embark on the adventurous road of war." "European countries are unwilling to follow the United States in implementing measures that they believe can cause war." Weir used three sentences to express the European attitude towards the current international situation: "First, they feel that European countries cannot continue to spend large sums of money for defense (i.e., arms expansion and war preparation) as they are currently doing, because they have neither the money nor the money to borrow. Second, they do not believe there is an immediate threat of war. Third, they believe that the time is ripe to take a positive attitude towards the issue of peace." Weir further said: "Europeans believe that the threat of a new world war can be prevented." "Europeans generally believe that Russia will not launch a war unless it is truly invaded and forced to fight back." Weir reached the following conclusion during this "European tour": "In fact, after this trip, I am more convinced than ever that the desire for peace is something shared by all people around the world, not only in European countries but also in Asian countries. I believe this desire is developing into a demand from all countries' people to their government leaders, demanding that these leaders develop ways to achieve peace—this demand is so powerful that these leaders cannot ignore it."
    Weir saw the real crisis of the United States during his "European tour." Therefore, "based on his personal contact in Europe and his reflection after returning to the country," he advised his government: First, do not "go it alone." Second, do not force "allies" to accept American policies. Third, negotiations must be held with the Soviet Union. Weir said: "The position of those Americans who take a critical attitude towards Europe and stubbornly oppose all attempts to negotiate with Russia is, in my opinion, illogical." He said: "We should start negotiations without prejudice and in a spirit of mutual concession, and we should be prepared to negotiate peace on a fair and sincere basis." The people are convinced that there is currently "a good opportunity to ease the current tense situation and eliminate the threat of war." If the United States "does not fully utilize this opportunity, it will make a foolish mistake with tragic consequences."
    Nixon, Lehman, and Weir personally witnessed during their "travels" how the American "strength" policy and "cold war" policy are deeply hated by the people of all countries. Their "travels" should be beneficial to all the rulers of the United States, and they should understand how bad a position they are in!

### 从“旅行”说起

    从“旅行”说起
    金之光
    中国有句古话说：“读万卷书，行万里路”，可见旅行的确可以使人增长不少知识的。这不但对
    一般人是如此；就是对那些被“高额利润”冲昏了脑袋的华尔街老板们，“旅行”也未尝不可以使他们清醒一下的。
    美国副总统尼克松目前正在作他的“远东之行”。当他十月十七日抵达澳大利亚的墨尔本时，他碰到的不是欢迎的行列而是抗议的群众。墨尔本人民到处张贴标语和散发小册子，请这位“狡猾的家伙”滚出去。墨尔本人民这当头一棒，对于阴谋拉拢太平洋上的“盟友”组织侵略集团的美国政客，不能不说是一个很好的教训。据美联社悉尼消息：尼克松自己就承认，他在遇到的澳大利亚人中间，大多数都反对重新武装日本。
    美国民主党参议员利曼，不久前曾访问了英国、法国和意大利。据美联社十月十一日芝加哥电讯报道，利曼在这次旅行中发现：“在欧洲人民中间，美国的威信从来也没有目前这样低落过。”利曼说：“欧洲的许多人民把我们（美国）看作是已被国产的法西斯阴影所笼罩的国家，他们认为美国人民完全陷于恐惧、惊慌和歇斯底里状态中。”是什么使美国在欧洲的“威信”低到“令人痛心”的地步的呢？路透社十月六日纽约电讯说，利曼承认，那就是一种代表着疯狂的战争叫嚣和法西斯统治的东西——麦卡锡主义。利曼说：“我认为麦卡锡主义对于我们国家、我们的自由和我们的民权是一个很大的威胁。”
    还是在今年四五月间，美国“国民钢铁公司”董事长、“美国钢铁研究所”所长、匹兹堡商会副主席魏尔，也到欧洲作了第二次世界大战结束后的第五次访问。魏尔在他的“欧游观感”中谈到了西欧各国人民要求和平的愿望和反对战争的情绪。他直率地说，饱经战争灾害的西欧各国人民，“愿意和平超过其他一切。这是无可怀疑的。”“他们不愿走上战争的冒险道路。”“欧洲各国不愿追随美国实行他们看来可以引起战争的措施。”魏尔用三句话来表达欧洲人对目前国际局势的态度：“一、他们感觉到欧洲各国不能继续像目前一样为防务（就是扩军备战）而花费大量款项，因为他们既没有钱，也没有钱可借。二、他们不相信有战争的直接威胁。三、他们认为对和平问题采取积极态度的时机已经成熟。”魏尔并且进一步地说：“欧洲人认为新的世界大战的威胁是能够制止的。”“欧洲人总认为如果俄国没有真正受侵袭，没有被迫而进行反击的话，俄国是不会发动战争的。”魏尔在这次“欧游”中得到了以下的结论，他说：“实际上，在这次旅行后，我较以往更加深信，要求和平的愿望是全世界所有人民共同拥有的东西，不但欧洲各国，而且亚洲各国也确信如此。我相信这种愿望正在发展成为所有各国人民对于他们的政府领袖的要求，要求这些领袖发展实现和平的方法——这种要求是这样强有力，不容这些领袖们置之不顾。”
    魏尔在“欧游”中看到了美国的真正的危机。因此，他“根据在欧洲的亲身接触和回国后的思考”忠告自己的政府：一、不要“单独干”。二、不要强迫“同盟者”接受美国的政策。三、必须和苏联进行协商。魏尔说：“那些对欧洲采取挑剔态度，并且顽固地反对和俄国举行谈判的一切尝试的美国人的立场，我认为是不合乎逻辑的。”他说：“我们应该不怀成见、用相互让步的精神着手进行谈判，应该准备在公平和真诚的基础上来谈判和平。”人民确信目前“有良好的机会来缓和目前紧张的局势并消除战争的威胁。”如果美国“不充分运用这一机会，就要犯愚蠢的，招致悲惨后果的错误。”
    尼克松、利曼和魏尔在“旅行”中亲眼看到了美国的“实力”政策和“冷战”政策怎样为各国人民所深恶痛绝。他们的“旅行”对于美国所有的统治者们都该是有益的吧，他们该懂得自己是处在多么糟糕的地位！
