In order to increase production and make up for losses due to reduced yields, Party and government leading organs at all levels in Anhui Province are vigorously leading farmers to rush to plant late autumn crops and vegetables. According to incomplete statistics from six special districts, including Fuyang, Lu'an, Chuxian, Wuhu, Anqing, and Huizhou, over 680,000 mu of buckwheat, carrots, potatoes, turnips, velvet beans, and vegetables have been planted.

The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a series of emergency instructions in early September regarding drought resistance to protect autumn crops and replanting late autumn crops. On September 17, it issued another emergency notice, "Resist Drought, Protect Autumn, Plant More Vegetables, and Sun-Dry More Vegetables," requiring all localities to regard protecting autumn crops and replanting as the most urgent task at present, concentrate efforts to lead the masses to do a good job in protecting autumn crops and replanting. It also required the vast number of farmers to plant more vegetables and sun-dry more vegetables to prepare for famine. Party committees and people's governments at all levels, in accordance with the spirit of the provincial committee's instructions, conscientiously carried out mobilization and deployment, and dispatched cadres to the countryside to lead the work of protecting autumn crops and replanting. The CPC Huizhou District Committee convened a replanting work conference on September 10, determined replanting targets, and each district committee member went to various counties after the meeting to conduct inspections and supervision. In Chuxian Special District, the three counties of Xuyi, Fengyang, and Binghui convened joint meetings of district heads and district party secretaries to convey the information. In Lu'an Special District, Shouxian County dispatched 30 cadres, led by a member of the county committee, to go to the countryside to help district and township cadres lead the work of protecting autumn crops and replanting.

Under the widespread and in-depth publicity and mobilization of cadres in various places, the farmers in various places have actively taken action to carry out replanting of late autumn crops. The masses in drought-stricken areas along the Huai River are using all water sources to divert and carry water to plant, overcoming the difficulty of not being able to plant due to dry land. According to incomplete statistics from Fuyang Special District alone, more than 76,000 mu of vegetables and other crops were planted by carrying water. After widespread rainfall in various places on September 20, the masses in various places seized the opportunity after the rain to launch a sudden rush to plant. While carrying out the replanting work, the people's governments in various places also led the masses to universally sun-dry and store dried vegetables and collect various substitute foods. According to preliminary statistics from Lingbi County in the Suxian Special District, more than 3.85 million jin of dried vegetables have been sun-dried and stored. According to statistics from seven districts in Jiashan and Fengyang counties, 125,230 jin of dried melon, sesame leaves, and purslane have been sun-dried and stored.

At present, the development of this work is still uneven. A small number of district and township cadres have a sense of complacency. They do not have sufficient understanding of the important significance of increasing production and saving for famine, so they have failed to actively lead the masses to carry out this work. Some areas still have some difficulties in the replanting work (such as a shortage of seeds). All localities must continue to overcome all difficulties in completing the autumn planting tasks, make the greatest efforts to quickly complete the replanting tasks, and do a good job in saving and preparing for famine.

    安徽省阜阳六安等六个专区
    抢种晚秋作物和蔬菜六十八万亩
    安徽省各级党政领导机关为了增加生产，弥补减产的损失，大力领导农民抢种晚秋作物和蔬菜。据阜阳、六安、滁县、芜湖、安庆、徽州六个专区不完全的统计，已种下荞麦、胡萝卜、马铃薯、蔓菁、泥豆和蔬菜六十八万余亩。
    中共安徽省委于九月初连续发出有关抗旱保秋补种晚秋工作的紧急指示，九月十七日又发出“抗旱保秋、多种蔬菜、多晒干菜”的紧急通知，要求各地把保秋补种工作作为当前最紧迫的任务，集中力量领导群众做好保秋补种工作。并且要求广大农民多种蔬菜、多晒干菜备荒。各级党委和人民政府根据省委指示精神，均认真地作了动员和布置，并抽调干部下乡领导保秋补种工作。中共徽州地委于九月十日召开了补种工作会议，确定补种指标，各个地委委员在会后均分赴各县进行检查和督促。滁县专区盱眙、凤阳、炳辉三县均召开区长、区委书记联席会议进行传达。六安专区寿县抽调干部三十人，由县委委员率领下乡，帮助区乡干部领导保秋补种工作。
    在各地干部广泛深入地宣传动员下，各地农民已积极行动起来，进行补种晚秋。沿淮受旱地区的群众，利用一切水源引水、挑水点种，克服了地干不能下种的困难。仅阜阳专区不完全统计，就挑水点种七万六千余亩蔬菜等作物。九月二十日各地普遍下雨后，各地群众抓紧雨后时机突击抢种。与补种工作开展的同时，各地人民政府还领导群众普遍晒贮干菜，收集各种代食品。据宿县专区灵璧县初步统计，已晒存干菜三百八十五万多斤。嘉山、凤阳两县的七个区统计，已晒存瓜干、芝麻叶、马齿菜十二万五千二百三十斤。
    目前，这一工作开展得尚不平衡，少数区乡干部存有麻痹思想，他们对增加生产节约备荒的重要意义认识不足，因此未能积极领导群众开展这项工作。有些地区在补种工作中尚存在一些困难（如缺少种子），各地必须在完成秋种任务中，继续克服一切困难，尽最大努力迅速完成补种任务和做好节约备荒工作。
