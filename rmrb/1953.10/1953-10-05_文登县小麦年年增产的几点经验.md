Wendeng County's Several Experiences in Increasing Wheat Production Year After Year
The CCP Wendeng County Committee of Shandong Province

Wheat is one of the main crops in Wendeng County, Shandong Province. Before liberation, due to the poverty of farmers and limitations in production conditions, wheat yields were consistently very low, with an average yield of 80 to 95 jin per mu, and the planting area only accounted for 26.7 percent of the total cultivated land area. After liberation, the vast number of farmers greatly improved their enthusiasm for production through land reform. In addition, the Party and the government gradually strengthened their leadership over production, and the average yield of wheat per mu increased year by year. In 1952, the average yield per mu reached 195.7 jin. In 1953, due to the intrusion of various natural disasters, varying degrees of production reduction were caused throughout the county, but after rescue efforts, according to preliminary investigations, the average yield per mu was still more than 161 jin.

The continuous increase in wheat production in Wendeng County is inseparable from the implementation of land reform, organization, and development of production policies. But from a technical point of view, the county's agricultural technology extension network, which adopted the method of on-site material selection and on-site promotion to guide farmers to improve farming techniques, also played a significant role in increasing wheat production.

The agricultural technology extension organization in Wendeng County was initially established by the County Agricultural Guidance Office in 1946. At first, only individual labor models participated. In 1947, labor models from five villages near the county farm used the Gao Village (where the farm was located) market day to meet and exchange experiences, and began to organize an agricultural technology research committee. By 1951, 93 percent of the townships and 79 percent of the villages in the county had established "Agricultural Technology Research Associations" or research groups, developing into a county-wide agricultural technology extension network. In the spring of 1953, the CCP Wendeng County Committee summarized the experience of increasing production over the past few years and comprehensively reorganized the organization of the county's agricultural technology extension network on the original basis. The county magistrate, the head of the county construction section, the farm director, and cadres from various people's organizations participated in the establishment of an agricultural technology research and extension committee. Its task is to summarize farmers' experience in increasing production according to the season, formulate promotion plans, and promptly check the implementation of the plans. Each district also established similar institutions. Townships and villages established agricultural technology research and extension groups, composed of five to nine people, including the main responsible cadres of the township and village, labor models, experienced old farmers, and propagandists. Its task is to impart production technology and collect the production experience of the masses based on the actual local conditions. After this reorganization, not only were the shortcomings of the past overcome, such as the inconvenience and time wasted for farmers to attend meetings at the extension station, but also the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels over agricultural technology was strengthened. Over the past few years, the agricultural technology extension network has made great contributions in researching and promoting agricultural production technology. The most prominent is that it has played a significant role in striving for continuous increases in wheat production. It has gradually helped farmers solve technical problems related to wheat varieties, prevention and control of wheat diseases and insect pests, cultivation methods, and rational fertilization.

Select Seeds Locally and Promote Them Locally

Before liberation, the wheat varieties in Wendeng County were very mixed. The common characteristics of these varieties were: thin stalks, intolerance to fertilizer, easy lodging, small ears, few wheat grains, and low yields. In the past, some good seeds had also been transferred from other places, but because they were not suitable for local conditions, the trial plantings were not successful. In 1942, Yu Qingchou and his wife in Gao Village, District One, discovered five ears of wheat with peculiar shapes – Bian Sui wheat (flat-eared wheat) – in their wheat field and used it as seed. They planted 25 seedlings in the autumn cultivation of that year, and then gradually promoted it. In 1946, the county farm used this seed, and the yield per mu reached 351 jin, an increase of 108 jin compared to the local average wheat yield. After demonstration comparisons, it attracted the attention of labor models and the masses in some villages near Gao Village, who asked to change to this variety. After several years of planting, the masses summarized its characteristics as: (1) High yield (20 to 30 percent higher than local varieties); (2) Short and thick stalks, fertilizer-resistant, and strong wind resistance; (3) Strong resistance to rust; (4) High flour yield (1.8 jin more flour per 100 jin of wheat than local wheat). By 1952, this variety had been popularized to 95 percent of the households and more than 90 percent of the mu in the county.

In the process of promoting Bian Sui wheat, the "Agricultural Technology Research Association" paid special attention to seed selection and purity maintenance. Through mobilization, the broad masses broke the past habit of not selecting seeds and launched a mass movement for annual seed selection. The selection was improved from field selection by farms and areas to ear selection in the fields. According to statistics, in 1951, the number of households selecting seeds in the field accounted for 60 percent of the total wheat-planting households in the county, and in 1952, it increased to 80 percent. The county's 248 labor models also established "seed retention fields." As a result, the excellent characteristics of Bian Sui wheat have been basically maintained.

Implement the Policy of Prevention First
Prevent and Control Diseases and Insect Pests

Wheat diseases are numerous in Wendeng County, the most serious of which is stinking smut. The masses were helpless because they did not understand the causes and prevention methods of the disease. In 1949, the Shandong Provincial People's Government promoted the method of using manure to isolate seeds to prevent and control this disease. After several years of experiments, farmers achieved significant results in adopting methods such as spreading manure, isolating manure, applying clean manure, and selecting seeds, changing seeds, soaking seeds, mixing seeds, or removing diseased plants. By 1953, stinking smut had been basically eliminated throughout the county, and other diseases had also been greatly reduced due to proper seed treatment and improved cultivation methods.

With the development of stinking smut prevention and control, farmers also attached great importance to the prevention and control of underground insect pests. According to statistics, in the autumn of 1952, those who prevented and controlled underground insect pests accounted for 15 percent of the total number of farmers in the county and more than 40 percent of the total wheat field area.
Improve Soil and Improve Farming Techniques

The county has about 100,000 mu of tidal land and nearly 10,000 mu of alkaline land, including 520 mu of heavily alkaline land that cannot be cultivated. In the past, there were also methods of pressing sand and exchanging soil to improve the soil, but only "strong soldiers and horses" households could do it. In recent years, under the leadership of the local Party committee and government, the collective strength of the masses has been mobilized, and the work of pressing sand and exchanging soil has been widely carried out. This year, 45 percent of the tidal land in the county has been transformed, and 95 percent of the alkaline land, except for those that cannot be cultivated, has been basically transformed. The yield of tidal and alkaline land after sand pressing is generally increased by 30 to 40 percent.

In terms of improving farming techniques, Wendeng County has achieved early plowing, deep plowing, and timely sowing. In particular, in recent years, with the gradual increase of new-style agricultural tools, the depth of cultivated land has generally been deepened to three or four inches. Some farmers have also expanded the area of digging the land (generally digging six or seven inches deep) in order to achieve deep plowing. There are also many farmers who use the method of deep digging once and then plowing once. According to statistics in 1952, 75 percent of the county's more than 320,000 mu of wheat fields were plowed once or cultivated once, and 23 percent were plowed once and then cultivated once. This has a great effect on increasing the yield per unit area of wheat.

At the same time, the county also promoted the experience of dense planting of wheat. The old habit of Wendeng County farmers was to plant in mounds, with a sowing amount of six to seven jin per mu. Because the sowing was too sparse, the land was not fully utilized. In 1949, the farm and some labor models carried out a comparative demonstration of mound planting and strip planting. As a result, strip planting increased production by 5 percent per mu. Since then, farmers have gradually changed the habit of mound planting, and the area of strip planting has increased year by year. In 1950, strip-planted wheat accounted for 5 percent of the county, in 1951 it accounted for 15 percent, and in 1952 it accounted for 30 percent. Some of the masses also began to experiment with the method of wide-row dense planting, and the planting area accounted for 3 percent of the total wheat field area in the county. In 1952, 12 labor models were mobilized to conduct "nest wheat" cultivation demonstrations in 12 villages in six districts. According to the 1953 wheat harvest summary: strip planting increased production by 7 percent compared to mound planting; wide-row dense planting increased production by 10 percent compared to strip planting; nest wheat increased production by 8 percent compared to wide-row dense planting. Generally, nest wheat yields 300 to 500 jin per mu.

Reasonably Increase Fertilization

Increasing base fertilizer is one of the important conditions to ensure increased wheat production. Before liberation, the quantity and quality of base fertilizer application were very poor, and the amount of hard fertilizer (bean cake, rice bran, dry manure, etc.) was even less. At that time, only about 1,000 jin of pen manure could be applied per mu. In recent years, with the advocacy of the leadership, the amount of base fertilizer applied has been increasing year by year. By 1952, an average of 12 carts of manure and 25 jin of hard fertilizer were applied per mu. The increase in base fertilizer has ensured the nutrients needed by wheat during the growing season.

Timely and phased topdressing is also an important task. The habit of Wendeng County farmers is to use urine to water wheat. Years of experience have proved that the fertilizing effect of watering wheat with human urine that has been fermented and diluted with water is very good. This experience was fully promoted in 1949. Generally, households can use urine to water half a mu to one mu of wheat in winter and early spring (because watering wheat in late spring delays the maturity period), and the fertilizing effect is no less than that of chemical fertilizers. In order to make up for the deficiency of natural fertilizers, the use of chemical fertilizers has also been increasing year by year. In the spring of 1953, a total of more than 2.16 million jin of chemical fertilizers were applied to wheat in the county, more than double the amount in 1952, with a dosage of 10 to 15 jin per mu. Wheat fields with topdressing accounted for 85 percent of the total wheat field area. Some also used calcium phosphate and wood charcoal in combination with increased base fertilizer and reasonable phased topdressing, and also achieved better results.

    文登县小麦年年增产的几点经验
    中共山东文登县委会
    小麦是山东文登县主要农作物之一。在解放前，农民因生活困苦和生产条件限制，小麦产量一贯很低，每亩平均产量是八十至九十五斤，播种面积只占总耕地面积的百分之二十六点七。解放后，广大农民经过土地改革，大大提高了生产积极性，再加上党和政府逐步加强对生产的领导，小麦每亩平均产量逐年提高。一九五二年每亩平均产量达到一百九十五点七斤。一九五三年因为各种自然灾害的侵袭，造成全县范围内不同程度的减产，但经过抢救后，据初步调查，每亩平均产量仍有一百六十一斤多。
    文登县小麦连年增产是和贯彻土地改革、组织起来、发展生产各项政策分不开的。但从技术方面来说，这个县的农业技术推广网，采用就地取材就地推广的办法，指导农民改进耕作技术，对提高小麦产量，也起了很大作用。
      文登县的农业技术推广组织，最初是县农业指导所在一九四六年开始建立起来的。起初只有个别劳动模范参加。一九四七年，县农场附近五个村的劳动模范，利用高村（农场驻村）集期碰头交流经验，并开始组织了农业技术研究委员会。到一九五一年，全县已有百分之九十三的乡、百分之七十九的村，成立了“农业技术研究会”或研究小组，发展成为一个具有全县规模的农业技术推广网。一九五三年春，中共文登县委员会总结了几年来的增产经验，又把全县农业技术推广网的组织，在原有的基础上普遍加以整理。由县长、县建设科长、农场场长，并吸收各人民群众团体等干部参加成立农业技术研究推广委员会。它的任务是：按季节总结农民的增产经验，作出推广方案和及时检查贯彻方案的情况。各区也成立同样的机构。乡、村成立农业技术研究推广小组，以乡、村主要负责干部、劳动模范、生产有经验的老农、宣传员五至九人组成。它的任务是依据本地实际情况，传授生产技术和汇集群众的生产经验。经过这次整顿后，不仅克服了过去农民因到推广站开会不便和耽误工夫的缺点，同时加强了各级党委和政府对农业技术的领导。几年来，农业技术推广网在研究推广农业生产技术方面，有很大的贡献。最突出的是在争取小麦连续增产方面起了不少作用。它逐步地帮助农民解决了有关小麦品种、防治小麦病虫害、耕作方法、合理施肥等技术问题。
    就地选种就地推广
    解放以前，文登县的小麦品种很杂。这些品种共同的特点是：秸子细、不耐肥、易倒伏、穗头小、麦粒少和产量低。过去也从外地调进过一些好种籽，但因不适合当地条件，试种都没有成功。一九四二年，一区高村镇于清绶夫妇在自己的麦田里发现了五穗形状奇异的小麦——扁穗麦，并用它作种籽，在当年秋耕时播种了二十五墩，以后逐年推广，一九四六年，县农场用这种种籽，每亩产量达三百五十一斤，比当地一般小麦增产一百零八斤。经过示范对比，引起了高村附近一些村的劳动模范和群众的注意，纷纷要求换种。这个品种经过几年的种植，群众总结它的特点有：（一）产量高（比当地品种增产百分之二十至三十）；（二）秆子矮而粗、耐肥、抗风力强；（三）抗疸性强；（四）出粉率高
  （每百斤小麦比当地小麦多出粉一点八斤）。到一九五二年，这种品种已普及到全县百分之九十五的户数，百分之九十以上的亩数。
    在推广扁穗小麦的过程中，“农业技术研究会”特别注意了选种保纯工作。经过发动，广大群众打破了过去不选种的习惯，开展了群众性的年年选种的运动。由场选、片选提高到田间穗选。据统计，一九五一年全县田间选种户占总植麦户的百分之六十，一九五二年又增加到百分之八十。这个县的二百四十八位劳动模范，还建立了“留种地”。扁穗小麦的优良特性因而基本得到保持。
    贯彻防重于治的方针
        防除病虫害
    文登县小麦病害很多，其中最严重的是腥黑穗病。群众因不懂病害的原因和防治办法，束手无策。一九四九年，山东省人民政府推广用粪种隔离的办法防治这种病害，经过几年的实验，农民在采用铺粪、隔离粪、施净粪及选种、换种、浸种、拌种、或拔除病株等方法上，都有显著成绩。到一九五三年全县的腥黑穗病已基本消灭，其他病害也因种子处理得法及改进栽培方法等而大大减轻。
    随着防治腥黑穗病工作的开展，农民对防治地下虫害也很重视。据统计，一九五二年秋防治地下虫害的占全县总农户的百分之十五，占麦田总面积的百分之四十以上。
  改良土壤提高耕作技术
    全县有泊地约十万亩，碱地近万亩，其中有无法耕种的重碱地五百二十亩。过去也有压沙换土，改良土壤的办法，但只有“兵强马壮”户才能作到。几年来，在当地党委和政府的领导下，发动群众的集体力量，压沙换土工作已广泛开展。今年全县已有百分之四十五的泊地得到改造，碱地除不能耕种的外，有百分之九十五得到基本改造。经过压沙的泊地、碱地产量一般提高百分之三十到四十。
    在提高耕作技术方面，文登县作到了早耕、深耕和适时播种。特别是近年来随着新式农具逐年增加，耕地深度一般加深到三、四寸。有的农民为了达到深耕，还扩大了刨地的面积（一般刨六、七寸深）。也有不少农民采用深刨一遍再耕一遍的办法。据一九五二年的统计，全县三十二万多亩麦田，刨一遍或耕一遍占百分之七十五，刨一遍再耕一遍的占百分之二十三。这对提高小麦单位面积产量有很大作用。
    与此同时，该县也推广了小麦密植的经验。文登县农民旧有习惯是墩播，每亩播种量六斤到七斤。因为播得太稀，土地并没有完全利用。一九四九年农场和部分劳动模范，进行墩播和条播的对比示范，结果条播每亩增产百分之五，从此农民就逐渐改变了墩播习惯，条播的面积逐年增加。一九五○年全县条播小麦占百分之五，一九五一年占百分之十五，一九五二年到百分之三十。宽幅密植的种法，部分群众也开始试验，播种面积占全县麦田总面积的百分之三。一九五二年又发动十二个劳动模范分布在六个区十二个村中，进行“窝麦”栽培示范。据一九五三年麦收总结：条播比墩播增产百分之七；宽幅密植比条播增产百分之十；窝麦比宽幅密植增产百分之八。一般窝麦每亩产三百斤至五百斤。
    合理地增施肥料
    增施基肥是保证小麦增产的重要条件之一。解放前施基肥的数量和质量都很差，至于硬肥（豆饼、米糠、大粪干等）的用量就更少了。当时每亩仅能施圈粪一千斤左右。近年来经过领导方面的提倡，施基肥量已逐年增加，到一九五二年每亩平均上粪十二车，硬肥二十五斤。由于基肥的增加，保证了小麦在生长期间所需养料。
    适时分期追肥也是一项重要的工作。文登县农民的习惯是尿浇小麦。历年经验证明：沤过的人尿加水后浇麦的肥效很好。这个经验曾在一九四九年全面推广，一般户在冬季和初春（因晚春浇麦成熟期晚）都能做到用尿浇麦半亩到一亩、肥效不比化学肥料低。为了补足自然肥料之不足，施用化学肥料的也逐年增加。一九五三年春全县小麦共施化学肥料二百一十六万多斤，比一九五二年增加一倍以上，每亩用量十至十五斤。施追肥的麦田，占总麦田面积的百分之八十五。有的并在增施基肥，分期合理追肥的基础上，配合使用磷酸钙、草木炭等，也收到更好的效果。
