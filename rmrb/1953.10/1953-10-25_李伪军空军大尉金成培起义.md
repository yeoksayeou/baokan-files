    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 23rd — According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kim Sung-bae, a captain and base commander of the Rhee Syngman puppet army's Air Force First Training Flying Group, defected on the 19th, flying a U.S.-made F-51 fighter-bomber and landing at a base in northern Korea at 2:05 PM that day.

    Under the bloody rule of the traitorous Rhee Syngman gang, Captain Kim Sung-bae was forcibly conscripted into the puppet army. He had long harbored the desire to abandon this shameful life and return to the embrace of the motherland and the people, waiting for an opportunity to revolt. Recently, he saw all the conspiracies of the American aggressors and the Rhee Syngman gang to sabotage the Korean Armistice Agreement and obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and he resolved to revolt, leaving Sacheon Airport in southwestern Gyeongsangnam-do at 12:15 PM on the 19th and flying north.

    When Kim Sung-bae landed at a base in northern Korea, he was warmly welcomed by the local people and the People's Army.
