People in Vietnamese Enemy-Occupied Areas Oppose Conscription
Expansion of Bao Dai Puppet Army Encounters Difficulties

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the French invading forces in Vietnam, under the urging of the United States, are intensifying their efforts to expand the Bao Dai puppet army's light infantry battalions, but are encountering significant difficulties.

    As early as February of this year, France and the Bao Dai puppet regime decided to establish 54 puppet army light infantry battalions, totaling 40,000 men, this year in order to solve the problem of insufficient French invasion forces in Vietnam. The United States has consistently taken a positive attitude toward expanding the Bao Dai puppet army. A large portion of the U.S. dollars in military "aid" allocated to France for the Vietnam War has been designated for expanding the Bao Dai puppet army. When providing "aid," the United States has repeatedly expressed its intention to directly intervene in the expansion of the Bao Dai puppet army, thereby directly controlling this military force.

    However, American money and equipment cannot completely solve the various difficulties France faces in expanding the Bao Dai puppet army. To expand the puppet army, France and the Bao Dai puppet regime have used all means to forcibly conscript soldiers in the occupied areas. France, under the urging of the United States, also sent personnel to South Korea to learn from the American "experience" in expanding the Syngman Rhee puppet army. Despite this, the establishment of Bao Dai puppet army light infantry battalions has actually progressed very slowly.

    The main difficulty for France and the Bao Dai puppet clique in expanding the puppet army is the opposition of the people in the Vietnamese enemy-occupied areas. The "general mobilization order" issued by Bao Dai has been resisted by the people everywhere. In the city of Nha Trang, central Vietnam, a strike involving workers, students, and merchants was held in April to oppose Bao Dai's conscription. Young students in major cities such as Hanoi and Hue collectively resisted military training. Young people arrested and held in concentration camps in Hanoi, Khanh Hoa, and other places refused to wear military uniforms and tried to escape from the camps.

    Another difficulty in expanding the Bao Dai puppet army is the lack of commanding officers. The number of French officers lost on the Vietnamese battlefield each year is very large. Even if all the officers trained annually by the French Saint-Cyr military academy are used to replenish the losses, it is not enough. Therefore, France has long planned to solve the problem by training Bao Dai officers. According to statistics, Bao Dai currently has seven puppet military officer schools. Bao Dai's former Minister of Defense, Nguyen Van Tam, said that these military schools could train 4,000 officers this year. However, the trained "officers" are only at the squad and platoon level, which is far from enough to meet the need. The lack of qualified officers further reduces the combat effectiveness of the demoralized Bao Dai puppet army. As soon as they are thrown into battle, they are immediately dealt heavy blows by the Vietnamese People's Army.

    As the Vietnam War intensifies, France and the Bao Dai puppet clique are very anxious about the slow progress of the puppet army light infantry battalion expansion and its embarrassing performance on the battlefield. According to Agence France-Presse, France has ordered a battalion of French accomplices from South Korea to be urgently transferred to Vietnam to "serve as the backbone" in the puppet army.

### 越南敌占区人民反对征兵  保大伪军扩充困难

    越南敌占区人民反对征兵
    保大伪军扩充困难
    据新华社讯：侵越法军当局在美国督促下加紧扩充保大伪军轻装营的工作，已遭到很大困难。
    早在今年二月，法国就与保大傀儡决定在今年建立五十四个伪军轻装营，共四万人，以便解决法国侵越兵力不足的困难。对于扩充保大伪军的工作，美国一贯采取积极的态度。在美国拨给法国进行越南战争的成亿美元军事“援助”中，很大一部分被指定为扩充保大伪军之用。在进行“援助”的时候，美国已一再表示要直接插手扩充保大伪军的工作，从而直接控制这支军事力量。
    但是，美国的金钱和装备，也不能完全解决法国扩充保大伪军的多方面困难。为了扩充伪军，法国和保大傀儡曾在侵占区中使用一切办法强行征兵，法国并在美国的督促下派遣人员到南朝鲜去学习美国扩充李承晚伪军的“经验”。尽管如此，保大伪军轻装营的建立工作实际进展很慢。
    法国和保大傀儡集团扩充伪军的主要困难是越南敌占区人民的反对。保大颁布的“总动员令”到处遭到人民的抵制。中越芽庄市全市在四月间举行过罢工、罢课、罢市，反对保大征兵。河内、顺化等大城市的青年学生集体抵制军训，被抓在河内、庆和等地集中营中的青年拒绝穿上军服，设法越营逃跑。
    扩充保大伪军的另一个困难是缺乏指挥官。法国军官每年在越南战场上损失的数字很大，即使用法国圣西尔军校每年加紧训练出来的全部军官来补充，也不够数。因此，法国早就打算用训练保大军官的办法来解决困难。据统计，保大目前已设有七所伪军官学校。保大前国防部长严文智说，这些军校在今年可训练出四千个军官。但是，训练出来的
    “军官”都是班、排级的，离需要还远。合格军官的缺乏，使士气萎靡的保大伪军的作战力更加低落。他们一被投入战场，立即遭到越南人民军的沉重打击。
    在越南战争剧烈展开的时候，法国和保大傀儡集团对伪军轻装营扩建工作的缓慢和它在战场上不堪一击的狼狈情况，非常着急。据法新社透露，法国已下令将在南朝鲜的一营法国帮凶军赶紧调往越南，以便在伪军中“充当骨干”。
