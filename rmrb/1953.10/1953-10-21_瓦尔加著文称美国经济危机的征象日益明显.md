Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 18th: "Pravda" published an article by Academician Varga, discussing the crisis signs in the American economy. When analyzing the crisis signs in the American economy, Varga cited some convincing examples to illustrate that the "prosperity" has ended, and signs predicting the impending crisis are becoming more and more obvious.

	For a long time, large quantities of manufactured goods have no longer reached consumers, but have been piled up in the stacks of various industries, wholesale and retail trade organizations, in the hands of farmers, and in national warehouses. For example, according to the materials of the U.S. Department of Commerce, between the end of July 1952 and the end of July 1953, the inventory of wholesale and retail industries and the inventory in the hands of manufacturers increased by 6 billion U.S. dollars, reaching a huge amount of 77.3 billion U.S. dollars. The value of this inventory exceeded the total output value of American industry in 1949 - estimated at 75.4 billion U.S. dollars.
	In recent years, large quantities of agricultural products have also been piled up in farmers' granaries and national warehouses. Before the harvest began this year, warehouses across the country were hoarding agricultural products worth about 3 billion U.S. dollars, which is twice as much as a year ago.
	Agricultural monopolies and officials of the Department of Agriculture insist that due to the surplus of wheat, measures need to be taken to reduce the area planted with wheat. They say this at a time when millions of working people in capitalist countries are actually starving. In the United States, even former U.S. President Truman had to admit that one-third of the U.S. population eats poorly.
	The total inventory of the United States can be estimated at about 100 billion U.S. dollars, which is at least twice the amount required for normal reproduction. Unless industrial production is drastically reduced and prices are significantly lowered, these "surplus" items will not be sold.
	Although production volume remains high, wholesale prices have recently shown a downward trend.
	Varga mentioned the situation of the American automobile market. In the first half of 1953, the U.S. automobile industry produced 1.06 million more passenger cars than in the same period in 1952. However, selling cars has become very difficult. In one year, the price of used cars has fallen by 20 to 30 percent. Due to increasing difficulties in sales, in the third quarter, the monopolies were forced to lower prices one after another.
	Varga continued: In the third quarter, industrial production began to be reduced. Steel production had maintained a 100% operating rate this year, but in the third week of August, the operating rate dropped to 87.3%. Large companies manufacturing agricultural machinery announced production cuts in August. Truck production has also been reduced.
	Varga pointed out: On the stock exchange, the continuous decline in the prices of industrial enterprise stocks is a sure sign of the impending crisis. In mid-September, stock prices fell to their lowest level in sixteen months.
	Talking about the issue of unemployment, Varga said: American "optimists" say that the "employment" figures for August are an unprecedented record in the United States, insisting that the number of unemployed has been reduced to 1.24 million. However, it is well known that U.S. unemployment and employment statistics are deceptive. They are based on surveys of selected thousands of workers, and the survey results are taken as the general situation of millions of workers across the country. The reactionary magazine "Fortune" predicted in its September issue that due to the developing crisis, the number of unemployed will increase to seven million.
	Varga said at the end of the article: These figures and facts show that in the United States, the crisis of overproduction is approaching. American monopolists are trying their best to avoid this crisis by intensifying the arms race. But this method has never allowed capitalist countries to escape the inevitable crisis; nor will it allow the United States to escape. On the contrary, it will inevitably make capitalist contradictions more acute and intense.

    瓦尔加著文称美国经济危机的征象日益明显
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：“真理报”刊载了科学院院士瓦尔加的一篇文章，论述美国经济中的危机征象。瓦尔加在分析美国经济中的危机征象的时候，举出了一些令人信服的例子，说明“繁荣”已经结束，预示危机即将来到的征象越来越明显了。
    很久以来，大批制成品就不再到达消费者的手里，而堆积在各业的堆栈、批发与零售贸易机构里，堆积在农民手里以及国家的堆栈中。譬如，按照美国商务部的材料，在一九五二年七月底到一九五三年七月底之间，批发与零售业的存货以及制造商手头的存货增加了六十亿美元，总数到了七百七十三亿美元的庞大数目。这批存货在价值上超过了一九四九年美国工业的生产总值——据估计是七百五十四亿美元。
    在最近几年中，在农民的粮仓与国家的堆栈里还堆积了大批的农产品。在今年开始收割以前，全国各堆栈积压着价值大约三十亿美元的农产品，也就是说为一年以前的两倍。
    农业垄断资本和农业部的官员硬说，由于小麦过剩，所以需要采取措施，削减种植小麦的面积。他们说这样的话，是在这样的时候，即资本主义国家中，有千百万劳动人民实际上在挨饿，在美国，连前美国总统杜鲁门也不得不承认，美国人口中三分之一吃得很坏。
    美国的全部存货可以估计为大约价值一千亿美元，这至少是正常的再生产过程所需要的数目的两倍。除非大量削减工业生产量，大大地降低价格，这些“剩余”物品将无法卖掉。
    虽然生产量仍然很高，批发物价最近却呈现下降趋势。
    瓦尔加提到美国汽车市场的情况。在一九五三年上半年，美国汽车工业生产的客车比一九五二年同一时期多一百零六万辆。但是卖出汽车已经成为非常困难的事情。在一年里面，旧汽车的价格下跌了百分之二十到三十。由于销售日益困难，在第三季度，各垄断资本就接二连三地被迫减低价格。
    瓦尔加继续说：在第三季度，工业生产量开始削减。钢铁生产今年原来一直保持百分之百的开工率，但在八月的第三个星期的时候，开工率降低到了百分之八十七点三。制造农业机器的大公司在八月份宣布削减生产。卡车的生产量也削减了。
    瓦尔加指出：在证券交易所里，工业企业股票价格不断下跌，这是预示危机即将来到的肯定征象。在九月中旬，股票价格降低到了十六个月以来的最低水平。
    谈到失业问题，瓦尔加说：美国的“乐观主义者”说，八月份的“就业”数字是美国的空前纪录，硬说失业人数已经降低到了一百二十四万人。但是举世皆知，美国的失业与就业统计是骗人的。它们的根据是对挑选出来的几千个工人的调查，把调查结果当作全国千百万工人的普遍情况。反动杂志“幸福”在九月的一期中预测说，由于正在发展的危机，失业人数将增加到七百万。
    瓦尔加在文章的最后说：这些数字与事实说明，在美国，生产过剩的危机正在迫近。美国垄断资本家尽力想以加紧军备竞赛来避免这种危机。但是这种办法从来也没有使资本主义国家逃过不可避免的危机；也不会使美国逃得过。相反的，倒是必然会使资本主义矛盾更加尖锐与剧烈。
