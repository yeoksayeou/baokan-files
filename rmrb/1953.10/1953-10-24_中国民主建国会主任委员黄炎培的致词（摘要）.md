The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Members' Representative Conference has opened. On behalf of the China Democratic National Construction Association, I extend warm congratulations to the conference.

The nature and organizational membership of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association are somewhat different. However, the main target of our work is industry and commerce, and our relationship is very close. In the period of national economic construction in the future, we must further strengthen contact, consultation, and cooperation, and jointly shoulder the tasks assigned to us by the state.

Representatives! Comrades! We have consistently worked together to help industrialists and businessmen conduct self-education and self-transformation, but the old habits of the industrial and commercial circles have not yet been completely eradicated. We must continue to work hard to correct those bad habits of tax evasion, speculation, and profiteering. This is a specific task for us at present. I am pleased to report that if everyone serves the people honestly, industrialists and businessmen! Your broad road is right in front of you.

The state has pointed out a road of socialist transformation for private industrialists and businessmen, which is state capitalism. Some private enterprises, after accepting the leadership of the state-owned economy and embarking on the road of state capitalism, have their production serving the country more directly, their business management greatly improved due to changes in organizational systems, their productivity greatly increased due to changes in production relations, and their public-private relations and labor-capital relations better handled. Problems such as raw materials, capital, and sales have also been properly resolved. Those who were originally losing money are now making profits, and those who had small profits are now making more, which guarantees the legitimate profits of industrialists and businessmen. However, patriotic industrialists and businessmen should put the interests of the country and the workers first, and then consider their own legitimate interests.

Private enterprises embarking on the road of state capitalism have even more significant meaning: enterprises have progressed, contributions to the country have increased, and people have gradually been transformed. I remember that at the Fourth Members' Congress of the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association on September 7, 1952, I conveyed Chairman Mao's instructions, which said: "...Under the conditions of China, those few far-sighted people in the bourgeoisie may exceed the above requirements and accept the basic ideas of the working class, that is, socialist ideas, and thus become interested in the socialist cause. They run factories on the one hand and do not demand to change their components and careers immediately; on the other hand, they see the great contribution of the socialist cause to mankind and want to be socialists in the future. Such people are possible, and we should welcome them." How great an encouragement Chairman Mao's instructions give us! Representatives! Comrades! We should wholeheartedly follow this and strive to promote more and more patriotic industrialists and businessmen to follow this wholeheartedly.

Representatives! Comrades! The country has stepped forward towards planned economic construction. The tasks assigned to us by the state are glorious and great. We must identify the direction, we must recognize the future, and we are confident, courageous, and also patient. This is the case for the comrades of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and it is also the case for the comrades of the China Democratic National Construction Association. Let us unite closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and work with the people of the whole country to complete the country's planned economic construction, first the first five-year plan! Representatives! Comrades! Let us fight to complete our historical mission!

On behalf of the China Democratic National Construction Association, I wish the conference success! I wish the representatives good health!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

    中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培的致词（摘要）
    中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会开幕了。我代表中国民主建国会向大会致热诚的祝贺。
    工商业联合会和民主建国会两个会的性质和组织成员是多少有所不同的。但我们双方的工作都是以工商业为主要对象，我们双方的关系是非常亲密的。今后在国家经济建设时期，更要进一步地加强联系、协商和配合，共同负担起国家交给我们的任务。
    代表们！同志们！我们一贯地共同帮助工商业者们进行自我教育、自我改造，但工商业界的积习一时还没有能清洗，那些偷税漏税投机取巧的恶劣作风，我们必须继续努力纠正，这是我们当前的一种具体任务。我所乐于报告的，如果大家规规矩矩地为人民服务，工商业者们！你们的康庄大道就在眼前了。
    国家给私营工商业者指出了一条进行社会主义改造的大道，就是国家资本主义。有些私营企业，接受了国营经济领导，走上了国家资本主义这条大道以后，生产更直接地为国家服务，经营管理因组织制度的变化而大大地改善了，生产力因生产关系的变化而大大地提高了，公私关系、劳资关系都搞得更好了。原料、资金、销路等问题也都适当地得到解决，原来亏本的有盈余了，盈余少的、多起来了，这就使工商业者合法的利润有保障了。但是爱国的工商业者应该把国家的利和工人的利首先顾到，然后顾到自己的合法的利。
    私营企业走上了国家资本主义大道，还有更重大的意义：企业进步了，对国家的贡献加多了，人也逐步地得到改造了。记得在一九五二年九月七日中国民主建国会北京市分会第四届会员大会上我传达毛主席的指示中曾说过：“……在中国的条件下，资产阶级中间那些少数有远见的人们，可能超过上述要求，而接受工人阶级的基本思想，即社会主义思想，因而对社会主义事业发生兴趣。他们一面开工厂，并不要求马上变更自己的成份和事业；一面看到社会主义事业对于人类的伟大贡献，想在将来做一个社会主义者。这种人是可能有的，我们对他们应该表示欢迎。”毛主席的指示给我们多么伟大的鼓舞！代表们！同志们！我们应当全心全意地照着做，争取推动越来越多的爱国工商业者们大家全心全意地照着做。
    代表们！同志们！国家已向着有计划的经济建设迈步前进着。国家所交给我们的任务是光荣的、伟大的，我们必须辨明着方向，我们必须认清着前途，我们是有信心的，有勇气的，但也有耐性的。工商联同志们是这样，民建同志们也是这样。大家紧密团结在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，和全国人民一道，来努力完成国家有计划的经济建设，首先是第一个五年计划！代表们！同志们！为完成我们的历史任务而奋斗吧！
    我代表中国民主建国会祝大会成功！祝代表们健康！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国伟大的人民领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
