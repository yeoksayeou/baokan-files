Comrades and delegates,

Since the establishment of the "All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles" at the last congress, our country has made tremendous achievements in political, economic, and cultural construction over the past four years. The three-year struggle of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, which was both heroic and arduous, has shattered the vicious invasion plans of U.S. imperialism, creating important conditions for the peaceful resolution of the Korean problem and related issues. Through the great victories of land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Antis" and "Five-Antis" campaigns, and other movements, our society has undergone tremendous and fundamental changes in all aspects.

New China is brimming with vitality and a vibrant atmosphere of construction everywhere. The victory of the anti-aggression war, the achievements and development in politics, economics, and culture, the great success of democratic social reforms, and the improvement of people's material living standards and cultural levels—all these have enabled our literature to achieve new successes and development on a new social foundation. This reflects the superiority of our national system.

New social life has endowed literature with new content and forms, changed the relationship between literature and the masses, and cultivated a new, vibrant literary team. Compared to the past, our literature has similarly undergone significant and profound changes.

These changes and developments are inseparable from the leadership and concern of the Communist Party, the wise guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies, and the efforts of all comrades on the literary front nationwide.

These changes and developments are first reflected in the content of literary works, in the themes and subjects of the works, and in the creation of new character images. The various reactionary and decadent literary ideas that had long permeated our literature, including feudal and colonial literary ideas, have been basically eliminated. The bourgeois individualism, liberalism, and the idea of "art for art's sake" have lost their positions in literature. Under the illumination of communist ideology, the literature of New China is obviously vibrant and full of confidence and optimism in the construction of the motherland and the liberation of humanity. As a result, the scope of literature and the range of life it reflects are much broader than before. According to our preliminary survey, over the past four years, approximately 2,000 novels, essays, news reports, and plays, as well as films shown, have been published in major newspapers and magazines nationwide. Among these, about 400 are based on industrial production and workers' lives, about 400 on rural struggles and peasant lives, about 300 on the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, about 300 on the lives of troops and military-civilian relations, about 70 on the lives and struggles of ethnic minorities, and about 200 on various other social struggles and social democratic reform movements. These numbers, although incomplete, clearly show how greatly New China's literature has changed compared to the past. We writers have drawn various new subjects and themes from the rich and boiling lives and struggles of the people of our motherland, creating various new character images. These subjects and themes rarely appeared or did not appear at all in the literature of our country a few years ago.

In recent years, there have been many successful and relatively excellent works. For example, the novel "Iron Wall" depicts the close cooperation between peasants and the People's Liberation Army during the War of Liberation, overcoming difficulties and supporting the frontline, creating a brilliant image of hardworking, honest, and selfless peasant cadres. The film "Steel Soldiers" and the play "Growing in Battle" show the firm courage and indomitable spirit of the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army during the War of Liberation, their unyielding loyalty to the revolutionary cause, and their noble qualities. Works like Ba Jin's Korean reports and Wei Wei's essay "Who is the Most Beloved Person" and many beautiful sketches, reports, and short stories reflecting the Korean War, from various angles, reflect the high internationalism, patriotism, and heroic spirit of the volunteers of our country. The novel "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River," which won the Stalin Prize, "Thunderstorm," and the opera "White-Haired Girl" vividly and deeply reflect the great land reform and changes in rural class relations, creating new and beautiful images of peasants. The play "In the Face of New Things" reflects the struggle between progressive and conservative forces during enterprise reform. These works have achieved certain artistic success and have had a broad educational impact on the masses.

It is also worth noting that for the first time in our country's history, literary works with the lives of ethnic minorities as their subject and the advanced figures of the laboring people of ethnic minorities as their protagonists have appeared. The unity, harmony, and happiness of the new lives of ethnic minorities are increasingly reflected in literature. Among them, there are many excellent works. Excellent young writers from ethnic minorities have emerged.

Our works have presented a large number of new characters: heroes of the People's Liberation Army and volunteers, labor models from factories and villages, Communist Party members, Young Communist League members, new types of women and children. They do not appear as oppressed and exploited figures as in past works; they appear as masters of life and creators of New China. Although the typicality of these characters is not yet sufficient, they nevertheless, to varying degrees, show the essential power of the new society. Through them, the noble revolutionary qualities and lofty moral concepts of the Chinese people are reflected, as well as the changes in social life and the great influence and power it has on the spiritual life of the people.

As a result, the relationship between literature and the masses has also undergone significant changes. Our literature has increasingly gained the concern and support of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the scope of literary popularization has expanded. Literature has become an important ideological weapon in their lives. The circulation of literary books has reached ten to twenty times that of the pre-liberation period. In 1952, the number of film viewers reached over 600 million. Factories, villages, and troops have widely carried out literary and artistic activities. Many works have been adapted by the masses into folk operas and dramas, and the masses have also written many folk arts, quick-talk, and songs. Laborers who had little or no contact with literary works in the past have now become the primary readers and audience of literature. The broad readership not only enthusiastically supports and cares about the creative activities of writers but also seriously supervises our literary activities. Opinions from readers come quickly and are very enthusiastic and sharp. Writers and editors of various literary publications often receive a large number of letters with valuable opinions about the works. Readers in factories, troops, offices, and schools discuss a work in a symposium format, which is becoming more and more common. The masses enthusiastically support works that have educational significance, reflect the essence of social development, and depict new characters with the noble qualities of the laboring people. They oppose works that distort reality or lack specific reflections of reality and are dry and boring. The masses often give opinions and ask us to provide them with the kind of works they want.

We should also look at the significant changes that have occurred within our ranks.

Four years ago, our understanding of the literary policy of "serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers" was still not consistent; some writers even had incorrect understandings, leading to debates about whether workers, peasants, and soldiers must be the protagonists and positive figures in works. There were still many phenomena of impure thoughts and unstable positions among writers. In 1951, along with the criticism of the reactionary film "The Life of Wu Xun," a nationwide wave of criticism and self-criticism of creative thoughts was launched; on this basis, the nationwide literary rectification movement that began in 1952 further criticized bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts in literature. Along with this, writers' deep immersion in life and ideological transformation work was carried out. The recent nationwide study of socialist realism in various places has also yielded certain results. This series of studies, criticisms, and self-criticisms have promoted the unity of our team's thoughts, goals, and steps and strengthened our team's unity. New writers, with their vigorous vitality, have driven old writers, and old writers, with their creative experience, have helped new writers. Old writers have recognized the importance of standing on the side of the working class, immersing themselves in the lives of the masses, transforming their thoughts, and striving to serve the people; they have recognized that the interests of the working class and national interests are inseparable. Whether party members or non-party members, whether writers from worker-peasant backgrounds or petty-bourgeois backgrounds, whether young writers or old writers, after the literary rectification and ideological transformation movement, our goals have become more unified, and thus our unity has become tighter.

Over the past four years, our new fighters have gradually increased, and today they have become the reliance for the vibrant and brilliant development of our country's literature.

According to incomplete statistics, over the past four years, a total of 256 novels, 159 poetry collections, 265 plays, and 896 essays and other works have been published nationwide. If we add the works that have been published in various publications but have not yet been published as single volumes, the total number will be even larger. Such a large number of works, the vast majority of whose authors are new writers, is noteworthy. It is worth noting that the works of worker-peasant writers are welcomed by the masses. The formation and development of the new team on the literary front indicate the depth of the potential power of our country's literature. These new writers are mostly young people. Although their works are not yet very mature, they come from the masses of workers and peasants, have been tempered by struggle, are familiar with and love the laboring people, have keen senses for new things and new characters, and have unlimited confidence in the inevitable victory of the construction of the motherland and socialist transformation. Under the cultivation of the Communist Party and the people, their future is bright. The socialist realism literature of our country will mainly rely on this new team to grow, so helping and educating them has become one of the important tasks at present.

Over the past four years, these achievements and profound changes in literature have first shown that the advanced thoughts of the working class have taken a firm leading position in our literary cause, and the concern and guidance of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for the literary movement, especially the 1951 directive of the Central Committee of the Party on criticizing "The Life of Wu Xun," have been of great significance for the development of Chinese literature in recent years. The literary movement can only develop correctly under the leadership of the working class's thoughts and the guidance of the Communist Party's policies.

However, the great changes and new atmosphere in our literature over the past four years are only the beginning. Compared to the speed of political, economic, and cultural construction in our country, and the daily changes in people's lives, and the demands of the masses for literature and art, our literary work is still far behind reality. At most, we can only say that we have laid a preliminary foundation for better completing the new tasks.

The lag of literary work behind reality is naturally due to objective reasons, such as the need for national work in the early days of national liberation, many literary workers participated in the administrative work of the government and other departments, thus weakening the strength on the literary front. However, the main reason should be said to be that there are still many subjective shortcomings in our work. First, it is reflected in the fact that the ideological and artistic levels of our works are generally not high enough. Although some of our works also describe new characters, these characters often lack the strong artistic infectious power, and compared to the brilliant heroes appearing in real life every day, the heroes in our works are not more vivid but rather less vivid. Some characters in some works are only the embodiments of the author's concepts and not the images of life itself. As a result, these works find it difficult to express the political thought of the work through artistic images and effectively play the role of educating and transforming the laboring people with socialist spirit. Many of our works, although they also describe new life, often only list phenomena without presenting these life phenomena according to Chairman Mao's saying of "concentrating them, typifying the contradictions and struggles within them." Many of our writers still do not dare to boldly express the contradictions in various aspects of social life, delve into the internal contradictions, and describe the complex class struggles in the new situation. They often either lightly slip away from these contradictions and struggles or use subjective methods to easily "solve" the contradictions, thus simplifying and one-sidedly presenting the complex and rich social phenomena, turning them into dry formulas. This is the widely criticized tendency of conceptualization and formulaization.

The shortcomings of literary work are also reflected in the monotony and roughness of literary forms, the lack of attention to language and structure; they are reflected in the backwardness of theory and criticism. Many of our writers and critics are still not good at skillfully and rigorously using our literary weapons.

The basic responsibility of the Literary Workers' Association for all the above shortcomings is the lack of leadership in literary thought, which makes it impossible to overcome these shortcomings in a timely and appropriate manner.

The analysis of these shortcomings and the methods of overcoming them will be discussed later. Here, it should be pointed out that the existence of these shortcomings gives us no reason to be complacent about the achievements mentioned above (of course, we should not and cannot be discouraged). These shortcomings have made our work and our tasks incompatible, and now, with the development of the revolution, new historical tasks are once again placed before us. These new tasks are more arduous and complex. If we do not actively and wholeheartedly strive to overcome these shortcomings and change the situation, then the state of literary work lagging behind reality will not only continue but the gap will also widen. The task of this congress is to discuss and solve such problems. Comrades, we believe that these shortcomings and difficulties can be overcome. We should realistically assess our existing achievements, learn from past experiences, and at the same time resolutely and without hesitation overcome shortcomings, improve work, and confidently welcome the new tasks of the new historical period of our country.

What are our new tasks? Our country is now in the period of realizing national industrialization and socialist transformation. Regardless of the department or the front, we should all struggle to complete the overall political task of national industrialization and socialist transformation.

This struggle is arduous and complex but will definitely be victorious. In this transitional period, we will continue to fight against imperialism abroad and the remaining hidden counter-revolutionaries at home. Within the people, we will also carry out the gradual transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, that is, under the condition of unity, fight against the bourgeoisie, and also carry out the transformation and education of tens of millions of peasants and handicraftsmen. In this process of socialist transformation, our social class relations will undergo more profound changes, and in the spiritual life of society, it will also reflect these intricate changes.

The task of literature is not only to reflect these intricate changes in the works but, more importantly, to use artistic power to promote the work of socialist transformation, that is, to use socialist ideology to educate and transform millions of people, to inspire their courage and confidence to move forward with the noble qualities and heroic spirit of the laboring people, and at the same time, to resolutely fight against the remaining feudal and imperialist ideological influences, to fight against capitalist ideology, to fight against various ideologies that resist socialist transformation, and to fight against backward consciousness such as fear of difficulties, conservatism, and selfishness among the people; these are important tasks before us. Our work is to use the true description of literature to teach the broad masses of the people not only to correctly understand today's reality but also to understand tomorrow's reality, to teach them to transform themselves, overcome obstacles, and undertake the great historical task of building the motherland and gradually transitioning to a socialist society in the midst of this complex class struggle.

To carry out such tasks, then our literature must first be literature with socialist ideology as its content, and our writers must be socialists or strive to transform themselves into socialists. We must require our works to be able to truly and concretely reflect reality, not only to show the people's today but also to look forward to the people's tomorrow, to illuminate their path forward—in a word, to give the people socialist ideological education through literary works.

Because of this, every writer must strictly require himself to work according to the method of socialist realism, must strictly require himself to better learn socialist realism, and strive to become a good student of Marxism-Leninism.

Some people have doubted whether this requirement is too high. I think such doubts are unnecessary; such doubts are due to some people's lack of understanding of socialist realism. In fact, socialist realism is not a new problem in our literature. Since the May Fourth Movement, the literary movement of the Chinese revolution has been developing under the leadership of the working class in the direction of socialist realism. Especially since Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art in 1942, the theoretical foundation of socialist realism in Chinese literature has been more clearly established, thus pushing the Chinese literary movement led by the working class since the May Fourth Movement to a new stage. The principles indicated by Chairman Mao in the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, including the writer's stance and viewpoint, the object of service, the relationship between the writer and the masses, the writer's attitude towards life and learning, the attitude towards accepting cultural traditions, as well as the creation of types, the method of criticism, etc., are they not the principles of socialist realism? For many years, we have all striven for Mao Zedong's literary direction, and we have rarely heard anyone say that this is a "too high" requirement. Why now, when it comes to the slogan of socialist realism, do people feel that it is a "too high" requirement?

It should be pointed out that there are still some comrades among us who have not been able to deeply understand the literary policies of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and thus have produced such doubts in some people. For this reason, we should strengthen the study, research, and propaganda of socialist realism, and should emphasize this issue, taking it as our common direction and goal in creative and critical practice.

There may still be such a mistaken idea among people: our country has not yet entered a socialist society, so why emphasize socialist realism in literature?

Such mistaken ideas must be clarified. First, even if it does not describe a socialist society, a socialist writer's creative method should still be socialist realism, such as A. Tolstoy's writing of "Peter the Great" or Gorky's writing of "Mother." Second, our country today is not that it has not yet entered socialism; on the contrary, in today's political, economic, and cultural aspects of our country, the strong leadership of socialism has long existed and is rapidly developing. Today, in our country's real life, not only have there been huge socialist enterprises, but there have also been a large number of brave pioneers who are creating conditions for the realization of a socialist society, and there have emerged millions of laboring people with the noble qualities of socialists. A socialist realist writer must require himself to be good at perceiving the direction of life development and the buds of new things, to be good at expressing life from the development of the revolution; the duty of a socialist realist writer is precisely to express things that are not yet universally present today but will definitely be universally present tomorrow. If one cannot correctly see today's and tomorrow's reality, one cannot correctly express today's and tomorrow's reality, such a writer cannot become a good realist.

To be able to undertake our tasks well, we must clearly affirm the method of socialist realism, and we must strive unshakably in this direction.

However, this does not mean that we require every work today to reach a high level of socialist realism. Such a requirement is unrealistic. To make our literature develop and grow healthily along the path of socialist realism, it must go through a process of learning and tempering, and it is necessary to gradually improve our level from creative practice, and fully develop the diversity of writers' styles. Therefore, if we detach from the actual situation of writers and require any writer to meet a certain specific "standard" or "specification" of socialist realism with a dogmatic method, this is unacceptable, and such a critical method is not socialist realism but subjectivism.

However, on the other hand, we should not use various reasons to refuse to advance in the direction of socialist realism; for the ideological tendencies in our creation that are against the interests of the working class and the people, the tendencies against collectivism and against realism, we cannot adopt an indifferent attitude. For the shortcomings in our work, we must adopt the correct method of criticism and self-criticism to overcome and correct them. Because the principles of socialist realism can only be achieved through constant learning and ideological struggle in creative practice.

Earlier, I pointed out that there are still many shortcomings in our current literary work. We must analyze these shortcomings, study how to overcome these shortcomings, and point out specific ways for future efforts.

First is the problem of creative methods. In creation, we have long paid attention to, but until now still universally exist, the tendency of conceptualization and formulaization in works.

Conceptualization and formulaization are the products of subjective ideology. They are a pair of twin brothers. This creative method violates the fundamental principles of realism because it forgets that "revolutionary literature is the product of the reflection of people's lives in the minds of revolutionary writers," forgets that the real life of the people is the only source of literature and art. It does not start from objective reality but from the author's subjective concepts. It simplifies the complex and rich reality into a formula composed of a few concepts, with a structure called the "three-part method" of backwardness, contrast, and transformation, and the character images have a few fixed "masks." Whether it is about a factory or a village, whether the theme is about increasing production or fighting for marriage freedom, such a formula can be applied. Such works, of course, cannot have authenticity and concreteness and will not be liked by the masses. The fundamental reason for the production of such works is that the writers have detached themselves from the lives of the masses and used the method of "building a carriage in a closed room" to write. This situation is naturally the worst, but generally speaking, it is not the most common. A more common situation is that the writer also has a certain life experience, also goes to factories, troops, or villages, and also grasps a certain amount of actual materials, but the works he writes often still give the masses a conceptual impression and lack artistic power. We need to analyze and study this situation more.

The primary problem, I think, is the creation of character personalities. The authenticity of realism is mainly expressed through the creation of character personalities. Engels said: "In my opinion, realism is not only the truth of details but also the correct expression of typical characters in typical environments." Therefore, typical characters in typical environments are the fundamental problem of the realistic creative method. However, some of our writers often overlook this fundamental problem. They often grasp some superficial phenomena from life, grasp a large amount of material that has not been digested by the brain, and before the characters mature in their own hearts, they impatiently pre-determine the theme for themselves and then look for characters according to need or fill in characters according to a formula. Such character personality traits are what Gorky said, are pasted on from the outside. Such characters, of course, cannot have a clear personality and flesh-and-blood emotions and will not produce artistic infectious power. Some of our writers often spend more energy considering whether the theme is correct, which is good, but they just forget how to express their theme through the description of character personalities and the relationship between personality and environment. As a result, their theme still cannot be well expressed. Such a situation can be said to be quite common. In the works discussed at this year's film creation conference, the main problem is that they have fallen into the above-mentioned flaw.

It is particularly worth noting that many of our works are weak in portraying the personalities of positive heroic characters. In many films, novels, and plays, the heroic characters, especially the leading characters, often lack individuality, lack emotion, and lack the luster of thought. Such characters often appear in the posture of a preacher or lecturer, standing high above the masses, idolized, as Marx criticized, "such a deified Raphael painting has lost all the truth of description." The reason for the production of such a situation is mainly that our writers are not yet familiar with the new heroic characters and have not been able to dig out their noble qualities and typical, positive characteristics, and thus cannot consciously exaggerate and highlight the portrayal. Our writers, although they have also visited and observed some heroic characters in real life and collected a large number of materials about their heroic deeds, but because we have not truly understood them from their inner lives, recognized their development process from the struggle, or even lacked a heartfelt love for them, in describing them, we still cannot help but replace them with our own subjective concepts or use a patchwork method to describe them, resulting in the loss of the luster of life in heroic characters, becoming lifeless images.

We know that the personalities of heroes are always developed from struggles. Without struggle, there will be no heroes. Those who cannot or do not dare to express the struggle between revolutionary and counter-revolutionary, progressive and backward forces, and place the heroic characters in the center of the struggle to describe them, cannot create vivid, inspiring images that move the masses. And therefore, in describing such struggles, the portrayal of negative characters is also necessary. However, in some of our works, heroic characters are often described separately from the center of the struggle. They are not standing at the forefront of the struggle but at the back or outside. Although the authors also try their best to shape their personalities, express their characteristics, and describe their life details, because they describe them away from contradictions and struggles, such character personalities are often undeveloped, the same from beginning to end; character personalities and the environment of struggle seem to have little relationship, and the theme of the work is not closely related; the author only describes personalities for the sake of describing personalities, not creating personalities from typical environments, so neither can we see the profound content of the times' struggle from them, nor can we see the class essence reflected in their personalities from the progress of the struggle; even some of the characters in them are dispensable for the work. In such works, the portrayal of negative or criticized characters is also often weak, conceptual, and clownish. Because of this, the authenticity of the work is weakened.

Next, another important problem that cannot be separated from character creation is how to express the contradictions and conflicts in life. Socialist realism requires writers to truly and historically concretely describe reality from the development of the revolution, so "literature and art must boldly express the contradictions and conflicts of life, and must be good at using the weapon of criticism, using it as an effective educational tool" (Malinkov). However, many of our writers often lack such boldness and such fighting spirit. We often easily avoid the contradictions and conflicts of life or simplify complex contradictions. Or we use a formula method to solve them. For example, today in our rural areas, on the one hand, the vast majority of peasants have broken away from feudal exploitation and become the most solid allies of the working class in the struggle for socialism, while on the other hand, a large number of individual economies of small-scale production still exist, and the ideology of individual economies still has its historical basis. Our agricultural technology is still in a backward state, so on the basis of strengthening the worker-peasant alliance, the contradiction between individual economic ideology and collective economic ideology in the countryside is certainly not a very simple problem. In the period of socialist transformation, educating peasants is undoubtedly a very complex task. Our writers must realistically recognize and deal with the complexity of these problems. We cannot easily regard these contradictions as problems that can be solved in one morning. However, in some of our works that describe agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, these contradictions are often easily solved through some comedic methods. From such works, we can hardly see the true face of today's rural life, as if the struggle for agricultural collectivization is a smooth road without the need for this or that arduous effort.

In works that describe wars, there are similar situations. In order to show the bravery of the People's Liberation Army, the enemy is often portrayed as too weak to resist, thus covering up the arduousness of the enemy's struggle and the great significance of its victory. In some works, the author, in order to show the spirit of optimism in battle, uses a large amount of description of "joking" and "making fun" in daily life, the result of which is to dilute the atmosphere of war and make it seem powerless. The fact is that only by showing the arduous struggle can the bravery and optimism of the struggle be more prominently shown, otherwise, it weakens the realism of war and also causes the characters' personalities to become blurred.

In works that describe other subjects, there are similar situations.

Because we do not dare to boldly express the contradictions and conflicts of life, there is also a lack of works that expose and satirize negative characters and backward phenomena among us. That is to say, we have not been able to fully exert the power of literature to mercilessly burn all the decaying and dying things in life, all the things that hinder progress.

How should this phenomenon be explained?

The fundamental reason is naturally the writer's insufficient understanding of reality. They either do not see or do not understand what the contradictions in real life are, lack clear-sighted observation, lack research on real life, lack the ability of independent analysis, generalization, and judgment. Due to insufficient political cultivation and narrow life experience, they are often dazzled by the appearance of reality, cannot see the essence of life, naturally cannot distinguish between essential and non-essential things, cannot see the whole, naturally cannot grasp the relationship between the whole and the part, so although they go to life, they only see the trees but not the forest, so it is naturally difficult to deeply reflect the contradictions of life in the works.

There are also some writers who, although they see the contradictions and struggles of life, cannot stand firmly on the side of the working class, are not wholeheartedly devoted to the fiery struggle, lack that high fighting spirit, so they do not dare to boldly touch these contradictions, do not dare to delve into these contradictions, they are afraid of making mistakes, in a state of mind of "just not making mistakes," they think that since there is no absolute certainty, it is better not to write or write less. This is reflected in the works as taking a light and evasive attitude towards contradictions or deliberately avoiding them.

Title: On the Problems of Literature and Art

Some writers worry that by depicting the contradictions within the people, they might "expose" the flaws of the people. This is a complete misunderstanding. By portraying the contradictions in life, we are actually showcasing the process by which the advanced forces in our reality overcome the residual backward forces. It is precisely because we depict such contradictions that we can demonstrate the strength of our advanced forces. Naturally, this first requires the author to stand firmly on the side of the working class and have a high degree of confidence in life. If the author lacks this confidence in life and instead has a skeptical and gloomy attitude, then he will not correctly recognize and reflect the struggles in real life.

Comrade Malenkov tells us: "Our writers and artists must mercilessly criticize the evil habits, flaws, and unhealthy phenomena that still exist in society in their works. They must create positive artistic images and portray the brilliant personalities of new-type people, thereby helping to cultivate a character and habits in our country's people that are completely free from the poisons and vices produced by capitalism." This is the task of our socialist realism literature. For this reason, we must oppose the tendency of "no conflict" or similar tendencies in creation, and oppose the tendency to describe life while being detached from it; we must make the creation of characters from the depiction of life's contradictions an important subject of realism.

Finally, there is the issue of writers understanding life. The characteristic of literature is to start from the understanding of life, through artistic thinking, to create life images, and to achieve the task of educating and transforming the people through such creation. Therefore, the issue of understanding life is a fundamental problem for realistic creation. To overcome the conceptualization and formulaic nature of creation and to improve the realistic level of our works, this is the key. In the past two years, many writers have gone to factories, rural areas, and the military to experience life. Many other writers have also eagerly requested to go deep into life. This is a good phenomenon. But it is precisely from this practice of going deep into life that the issue of how writers understand life has become more practical.

Among us, there is a fairly common situation where we emphasize the observation and experience of life, but relatively neglect the study and analysis of social life. We often say: "Go down to experience life." Naturally, experience is very important. What intellectuals often lack is the sensory knowledge of the lives of the working class and peasants, but if we do not unify the observation, experience of life with the study, analysis of life, then we will still find it very difficult to generalize and concentrate the complex phenomena of life. Many writers, after going down, often initially feel fresh, but gradually feel somewhat bewildered. I think this is related to the lack of study and analysis of life. We know that social life is an organic whole. Whether it is the life of factories, rural areas, or the military, it cannot be separated from the entire society and its development. A writer needs to have more knowledge of a particular aspect of life, but at the same time, he also needs to have a broad knowledge of various aspects of social life, and a certain amount of social and historical knowledge. Only then can he fully and historically analyze and research partial phenomena, and see the whole from partial phenomena, and reflect the broad era and spirit from a particular person or event. If we only limit ourselves to the scope of "experiencing life," we may stop at the surface phenomena of life, and thus what we depict will only be these surface phenomena.

We go to a certain factory or rural area and make it our base of life, which is completely necessary. But this does not mean that our world is just this factory or rural area, and our vision is limited to this factory or rural area. The meaning of the life base is to enable us to observe and study various aspects of life more deeply and concretely from the special familiarity with a certain life environment. A writer must have a historical materialist perspective, a worldview and historical breadth, a far-reaching vision, while at the same time having concrete and rich life experience and knowledge, the heroic spirit of the working class, and at the same time having a spirit of seeking truth from facts. Only in this way can our works have broad content and rich colors. The current universal existence of monotony and narrowness in the content and style of our works should be said to be somewhat related to the narrow and vulgar views of some writers on understanding life.

Whether observing, experiencing, and analyzing and researching life, a writer must be a practitioner of "fierce struggle" and not a bystander. The meaning of being a practitioner of struggle is not just whether the writer has taken on a certain practical job in a factory or rural area or the military, but more importantly, whether he treats his life and work with the stance and high fighting spirit of an advanced person. If one lacks such a stance and enthusiasm, then even if one takes on a certain job, one is still in the mindset of a bystander, which similarly cannot enable one to observe, experience, research, and analyze life more deeply from the struggle.

A writer in the life of the masses should not forget his own special task of labor, the task of an engineer of human souls. Taking on a certain job at the appropriate time is good, but he should always and everywhere be engaged in the observation, experience, analysis, and research of all people, life, and struggle. While observing, experiencing, analyzing, and researching, one should also try to write some short pieces in the form of reports and sketches. However, one must not, with a subjective and hasty desire for success, hastily set a plan for a 200,000 or 300,000-word topic as soon as one enters the life of the masses; such a plan is quite dangerous.

Understanding life and studying the party's theories and policies are inseparable, because the party's theories and policies are precisely the guiding principles that are generalized and concentrated from the struggles of the masses, with a high degree of objective truth. If a writer does not seriously study the party's theories and policies, he will not be able to understand the struggles of the masses; at the same time, if he does not seriously study life, he will not be able to understand the policies and reflect the policies. For writers who live among the masses, due to their more direct participation in the struggles of the masses, the study of theories and policies is particularly meaningful. But it should be pointed out that the party's theories and policies are only used as a guide for us to observe, experience, analyze, and research life, and cannot be used to replace life and replace literary realism. Formalists arrange plots and characters according to policy documents, which is neither studying policies nor understanding life. Works written with such cheap methods will never be literary works.

The above-mentioned several problems, I think, are the more important problems in current creation, and these problems we believe can be solved, and our shortcomings can be overcome.

In order to overcome the shortcomings in current creation, to improve the ideological and artistic level of our works, to practice the principles of socialist realism creation, and to enable our creation to undertake the mission of our times, we should require our writers to put the problem of creating character traits, especially the problem of creating positive character images, in the foremost position of our creation. In the great life of our country, heroes like Huang Jiguang, Zhang Mingshan, Li Shunda, and Hao Jianxiu appear every day. They inspire and encourage the people of the whole country with their noble qualities and heroic deeds, but in our literary works, such heroic artistic images rarely appear. This is a major shortcoming in our work. We should depict their life images more vividly, more concentratedly, more typically, more ideally, and more vividly in novels, films, dramas, and poems, and through them, more broadly and powerfully educate and inspire millions of laboring people. At the same time, we should also deeply depict the images of those negative and hostile characters, arousing the people's hatred and vigilance against them.

We should require writers to boldly reflect the various contradictions in the life of our socialist transformation period with the spirit of class struggle, and through these contradictions, educate the people to know what are the new, progressive, and irresistible forces that are emerging, and what are the dying, old, and decaying forces, thereby promoting the accelerated growth of new forces and the accelerated death of old and decaying forces.

We should require writers to depict the life of various aspects of our society more broadly, more freely, and more richly and colorfully, to choose the themes and subjects of works more broadly, and to create diverse forms and styles.

In order to practice the above requirements, writers should continue to go deep into social life, learn to use the perspective and attitude of a socialist to seriously observe, experience, analyze, and research all people, all classes, all masses, all lively life forms and struggle forms, all original materials of literature and art; they should strive to learn Marxism-Leninism, learn the party's policies, continue to strive for ideological remolding, to strengthen our ideological armament and improve our political level. Political learning and life practice, for writers, are always the most basic problems.

Comrades, our motherland's great life is so brilliant, our laboring people are so brave and wise, our literary sources are so vast and rich, as long as we work hard, we are completely able to write works that are not unworthy of our times!

Another important task for writers to improve the artistic level of their works is to master and practice our artistic expression techniques. A complete work of art must have a rigorous structure, vivid descriptions of characters and environments, and pure and expressive literary language; in poetry, it must also have beautiful rhythm and rhyme. The artistic techniques of a work are not separate from the work's ideological content but are subordinate to the content and serve the content. The structure and character descriptions of a work are themselves expressions of thought. Without ideological content, relying solely on technique, one cannot express anything. Therefore, we must resolutely oppose the bourgeois view of pure technique and formalism. However, on the other hand, if one thinks that a work can be vividly expressive of correct ideological content without relying on certain techniques, this is like having strategic thinking but not mastering combat techniques, and the result will undoubtedly be to lose the battle. Therefore, we must also resolutely oppose the erroneous tendency of neglecting or denying technique. In addition, there is another wrong view: acknowledging that technique is needed, but thinking that all past so-called techniques are those of the feudal class or the bourgeoisie, not suitable for our needs, and therefore we must "start from scratch." From this idea, the tendency to ignore classical literature arises. Everyone is familiar with this golden saying:

"If one does not clearly understand and master the entire culture created by the development process of mankind, and does not transform this past culture, one cannot build proletarian culture." (Lenin) In the problem of literary technique, we should also follow this policy. That is, we should follow the policy clearly pointed out by Chairman Mao in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" to inherit and carry forward good traditions. Of course, inheriting and carrying forward literary traditions mainly means inheriting the people's nature and realistic spirit of classical literature, and its scope is much broader than learning techniques.

It should be pointed out that in our current creation, attention to the problem of technique is far from enough. The chaos and laxity of structure, the impure and verbose language, have become quite common phenomena, and many good topics are often damaged because of this. Due to the lack of proficient literary techniques, many works, when read by people, feel dull and lifeless, thus losing or weakening their inspiring and infectious power.

A work should be a complete organic whole. That is to say, the descriptions of characters and plots are not arbitrary additions or deletions. That is to say, when handling characters, plots, environmental descriptions, etc., the writer should plan carefully, what should be there must be there, what should be removed must be removed, what should be long must be long, what should be short must be short. This work is called "editing," which is an important work in writing.

Our majority of works are very poor in this aspect. Some authors seem to have not even thought that materials must be refined and edited according to the needs of the work's theme. They often use whatever materials they have, regardless of quality, and without considering what is necessary and what is not, they stuff everything in and that's it, resulting in the structure of the work being bloated and loose, not forming a pattern, with characters crowded, half of them being dispensable or "better not to have," and the descriptions of the environment not matching the development of the story and the emotions of the characters, thus not playing a role in embellishment and enhancement.

Environmental descriptions must be linked with the actions and emotions of the characters. Isolated descriptions of the environment become a "backdrop" stuck behind the characters. One should describe flexibly through the interactions between the characters' actions, eyes, emotions, and the current environment. There are many examples worth learning from in our classical literature. Although those lives are far away from us, the environments and characters described in those works are still so clear and vivid to us, as if we can feel them face to face. Many of our classical works are extremely economical in the use of literary language. Works like "Water Margin," "Dream of the Red Chamber," and "The Scholars" often use a few thousand words to write out very vivid scenes. Chinese old poetry often uses a few dozen words to write out the entire mood, especially with incomparable conciseness. This tradition should be actively learned and studied by us.

Tolstoy once told us: to learn to eliminate the "bloat" in artistic prose and develop "muscles." This is very important. The fact is that our many works have too much "bloat" and too little "muscle."

Another important item in artistic expression techniques is the vivid description of characters. The description of characters is to write out the character and its development, so it is necessary to write characters from specific actions and the thoughts and emotions that control these actions, to write characters from the development of the story, and to write from various angles to avoid making a character one-sided, monotonous, and boring.

Because of the inability to portray characters from their actions, some works focus on the external appearance of characters, attempting to give the reader an impression through this. The external appearance of characters should of course be written, but it should not be used as the main method of describing characters. The external appearance descriptions in some works are also very rough, or formulaic. Sometimes, a few characteristics of a character's appearance or behavior are emphasized, attempting to use this to highlight his character. Characteristics can be written, but they should not be used to make the character a caricature.

The arrangement of main and supporting characters is also often not paid much attention to. Some supporting characters seem to be used only to highlight the main character, and they themselves do not have an independent existence, and their role in the work is similar to the "props" in a play. On the contrary, there are also cases where too many supporting characters are described, thereby damaging the main character.

The editing of materials, the organization of stories, and the description of characters are all meticulous work, and it is very difficult to achieve completeness without repeated revisions. The artistic roughness of some works is not necessarily due to the limitations of the writer's talent, but is often due to carelessness and haste, due to not being willing to spend more effort on revisions. Here, we must remember Chairman Mao's instructions to us: "Articles are reflections of objective things, and things are tortuous and complex, and must be repeatedly studied before they can be reflected appropriately; here, carelessness is not knowing the basic knowledge of writing articles." (Against Party Eight-Styles)

Another important issue in literary techniques is the issue of language.

The basic material of literary works is language. The language of literary works should be figurative, expressive, accurate, and concise, so that it can convey the thoughts and emotions the author wants to convey, and so that it can form vivid images. To express certain thoughts and emotions, one must use words correctly, construct sentences grammatically, and choose appropriate words and use appropriate sentences. "Vocabulary" poverty and lack of sentence variation will make the work stiff and dull, without appeal. On the contrary, piling up empty words and arbitrarily creating strange sentence structures will make the work verbose, messy, stiff, and unreadable. We cannot deny that these two kinds of problems are equally common.

Grammatical errors and inappropriate word usage are common diseases of novice writers. The root cause is that our language teaching in schools has not been done well. As for the poverty of "vocabulary," even experienced writers cannot avoid it. Everyone often uses the same set of "vocabulary," as if it has become a habit, and has never thought of finding new "vocabulary." One should remember that the overuse of old "vocabulary" often leads to serious mistakes. For example, using phrases like "ghosts crying and wolves howling" to describe the situation of our people under enemy bombing, or using "like cutting a watermelon" to describe the enemy's slaughter of our people, is completely unacceptable. Naturally, new "vocabulary" is not allowed to be overused. For example, there is such a sentence: "Tears splashed down like rain." Using "splashed down like rain" to describe the abundance and urgency of tears is somewhat inappropriate. Innovation is a good thing, but it cannot be done without hard work. Seeking convenience and arbitrarily innovating will ruin good things.

How can we enrich our "vocabulary"? Chairman Mao has long instructed: "We must learn language from the masses. The language of the masses is very rich, lively, and expressive of actual life." "We must absorb what we need from foreign languages. We are not rigidly borrowing or misusing foreign languages, but absorbing the good things from foreign languages that are suitable for us." "We must also learn the living things in the language of the ancients. Due to our failure to seriously study language, many living things in the language of the ancients have not been fully and reasonably utilized by us. Of course, we resolutely oppose the use of dead "vocabulary" and allusions, this is determined, but good and still useful things should still be inherited." (Against Party Eight-Styles)

Facts have proven that we have not correctly and seriously followed Chairman Mao's instructions.

Especially the matter of "learning the living things in the language of the ancients," our efforts are far from enough. Not only young literary people, but even many writers, do not pay enough attention to Chinese classical literature. "Water Margin," Lu Xun's works, have been read, but how many have really studied and learned them with effort? Lu Xun's works have fully utilized the living things in the language of the ancients, but in most of our current works, even the things Lu Xun has already utilized have not been inherited, let alone our own discoveries. However, on the other hand, "dead vocabulary and allusions" have not disappeared from us.

Those who have made relatively serious efforts and achieved some results are those who have learned the language of the people. In recent years, excellent works have all had this characteristic. The vast majority of new writers' works, if they had not absorbed the nutrients from the language of the people, the "vocabulary" would be even more impoverished. However, on the other hand, the tendency to misuse dialects and "riddles" without necessity is also very common. Vulgar tastes of "riddles" are also often used. "Riddles" are just language games and are not literary language. The misuse of dialects and "riddles" will not only fail to achieve the goal of enriching "vocabulary," but will also make literary language coarse and messy. We want to enrich our "vocabulary," but at the same time, we must also pay attention to maintaining the purity of our national language.

Socialist realism requires writers, according to their own interests, to choose various forms and create various styles. Therefore, actively creating forms that can fully reflect new life content and are popular among the masses is an important task of our literary work. Such achievements in the artistic form are the unique styles of individual writers and works. Lu Xun's works have his own outstanding style. Many of our current works can be said to lack unique styles. If Zhang San's work is replaced with Li Si's name, it would be difficult to tell who wrote it. This shows how lacking we are in creativity in the form of our works. The method of socialist realism creation not only does not hinder but also requires us to create and develop the diversity of literary styles.

We also require the development of various forms of literature, such as film scripts, operas, songs, and spoken literature, which have more popular effects, but have not been adopted by many writers. Film scripts are particularly lacking. We require more writers to pay attention to this aspect of creation.

Strengthening and improving literary criticism work is an important condition for promoting the growth and development of socialist realism literature.

In the past few years, our literary criticism work has played a certain positive role in literary creation activities: it has, through the criticism of specific works, fought against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois literary thought; it has criticized unrealistic methods of creation; it has criticized some non-proletarian thoughts and emotions in some works. It has given great attention to the works of new writers from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and has promptly propagated and introduced them, thereby encouraging the writing enthusiasm of workers and peasants. However, from an overall perspective, literary criticism work has serious shortcomings and is even more backward than creation. Literary criticism work has not fully played its role in guiding creation and has not more effectively completed its task of helping and educating writers.

Our literary criticism is often not a comprehensive and specific analysis of the content of works, but is subjective and dogmatic, one-sided criticism; it only criticizes the shortcomings of works without affirming the existing advantages at the same time; or it only praises the advantages of works without pointing out the fundamental shortcomings. The comprehensive, detailed, and scientific analysis of the ideological and artistic aspects of works is far from sufficient. Some works with national influence have not seen the response of the criticism community even after being published for a long time. The controversies over some problems in creation have also not been timely summarized.

The guidance and help for new writers are also far from sufficient. The editorial departments of various publications have almost spent most of their energy and time reading the manuscripts of young writers and giving them feedback. The comrades in the editorial departments are indeed hardworking. However, from an overall perspective, this work is not satisfactory. In the past four years, there have been very few specialized essays analyzing and guiding the general situation of young writers. The learning of literary heritage, we are not infrequently mentioned, but we have not, through literary criticism, used specific examples to arouse the attention of writers, especially the attention of general young writers.

It should also be pointed out: some critics often lack a sense of love and a helping attitude towards writers, and adopt a rude and attacking attitude. This rude attitude is manifested in the critic not using an objective and scientific attitude to study and analyze his criticism object, but only making judgments based on subjective impressions; it is manifested in the critic's lack of deep and comprehensive knowledge of the social life reflected in the work, but only using some revolutionary literary theories as dogmas and formulas to force-fit his criticism object; it is manifested in the critic's lack of patience to study all aspects of the work, but only picking out the prominent shortcomings of the work to make unfair and unconvincing judgments.

It should also be pointed out: subjective and dogmatic criticism, because it is not based on objective reality to measure works, to a certain extent, not only cannot solve problems but also makes writers follow it to write according to certain formulas. As a result, it promotes the tendency of formulaic and conceptual works.

It should also be pointed out: some critics do not start from the actual level of creation, but impatiently put forward inappropriate and overly high demands on writers, especially young writers. Some critics use some fixed standards to mechanically measure all works, thus causing writers to fear and be dissatisfied with critics. Such criticism does not inspire the creative enthusiasm of writers but hinders this enthusiasm. Some writers who lack self-confidence often do not dare to write because they are afraid of criticism. This is of course the writer's own fault for lacking courage, but the unhealthy criticism is also to blame.

Naturally, the attitude of ignoring and opposing criticism is also wrong, and the result will also lead to the decline of criticism. Writers themselves should also adopt an active and mutually promoting attitude towards the creation situation, and should not regard criticism work as only the business of critics.

Criticism work is not only to help writers but especially to educate readers. Young readers with weak judgment often take critical articles as their guide to reading works. The social influence produced by our criticism is very great, and the education and guidance of these young masses, critics bear a heavy responsibility.

Overcoming the shortcomings of literary criticism work, developing socialist realism criticism, and promoting creation are inseparable and equally important tasks. Therefore, we require our critics to stand on the front line of ideological struggle, be good at mastering Marxist-Leninist theory, master the methods of socialist realism criticism, and from a higher ideological level to objectively and truthfully analyze works, help writers, and educate readers. We should regard criticism as a serious scientific work and a mass work, not as a work of personal feelings. Therefore, we must strictly follow the standards of literary criticism indicated by Chairman Mao at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, insist on the principles of literary criticism, and carry out the struggle on two fronts in literary issues. We should require critics and writers to cooperate closely, use a mutually helpful, respectful, and learning attitude to establish a benevolent and comradely criticism, and we should require critics to always listen to the opinions of the masses and pay attention to social conditions. A critic should have more social knowledge than a writer, have a more systematic understanding of social life, and have a deeper ability to judge social phenomena, and then be able to give more effective help to writers.

The scientific literary theory of Marxism-Leninism, basic knowledge of national literature history and world literature history, and experience of Soviet literary creation, etc., are also the capital that literary critics must have. Some critics who manipulate texts and dogmatism can exist precisely because we lack the armament of Marxist-Leninist literary theory. Strengthening this aspect of learning should be an important part of the daily life of critics.

Finally, let us examine the work of the "Writers' Association."

The leadership work of the "Writers' Association" has not been done well in the past four years. The various shortcomings in literary work mentioned above are basically inseparable from the shortcomings in the leadership of the "Writers' Association."

Many working institutions of the "Writers' Association" have not been truly established for a long period. The "Writers' Association" has done very little in leading creative thought and literary criticism, and the leadership ideas and policies are not clear enough. For some work, such as the guidance of mass amateur literary activities, the learning of our national literary heritage, the "Writers' Association" has not given due attention. Under the guidance and supervision of the Party, we led the literary rectification movement and the learning of socialist realism, and achieved certain results, but some problems that arose in the movement and learning were not timely and appropriately concluded. It was also under the guidance of the Party that we organized writers to go deep into life twice and organized writers' creation, and gained some experience. However, after the writers went down, our concern was not enough. We were not able to provide necessary help and solutions to the problems that arose in their life experience process; recently, our work in this regard has improved. The work of several publications of the "Writers' Association" is also not satisfactory. For the popular publications that play an important role in popularization, we have almost given no guidance.

The leadership organs of the "Writers' Association" are not close enough to the writers. There are many writers in Beijing, but we have not taken effective measures to help writers exchange ideas and share experiences. In 1951, we organized several small groups based on writers in Beijing (poetry, novels, etc.), but due to the imperfect organization method and the lack of good preparation for each discussion meeting, the result was mostly formalistic, and then it disappeared. We need to make every writer in the group have something to say, and make the discussions in each group neither aimless nor dryly move theories, but have a center and truly solve some problems. If these basic shortcomings are not resolutely overcome, we will not be able to complete the new tasks given to us by the new historical period.

In order to adjust and strengthen various literary organizations, the National Committee proposed the suggestion to reorganize the "National Writers' Association" into the Chinese Writers' Association. I think this suggestion is correct and timely. The Presidium of the Congress drafted the draft constitution of the new Writers' Association, which will be discussed at the Congress. In the "General Principles" of this draft, the tasks of the Writers' Association are specifically stipulated. We believe that the Writers' Association should be a voluntary organization of writers and critics who actively participate in the revolutionary struggle and national construction of the Chinese people through their own creative activities and critical activities. Its main tasks are as follows:

1. Organize writers to create literary works with socialist ideology and high truthfulness, strengthen the leadership of creative activities and critical work. We must well accept the experience and lessons of the past four years, continue to organize writers to go deep into life in a planned and organized manner, learn Marxism-Leninism, learn the policies of the government and the Party, learn the theory of socialist realism literature and the experience of Soviet literary creation; we must, through the method of creation groups, carry out mutual competition and mutual assistance among writers on the research of creation, encourage the development of diversity in literary forms, genres, and styles.

We must make our critical work develop on a healthy path. When strengthening the leadership of critical work, we should pay attention to overcoming subjective and one-sided criticism, and help writers from the research and analysis of specific works, develop the principles of socialist realism from creative practice and criticism.

2. We should strengthen the guidance of literary popularization work in terms of thought and method. We must make great efforts to cultivate young writers, strengthen the guidance of young and novice writers, and spread mature experience. We should especially pay attention to cultivating new writers from among workers and peasants, and promote the literary movements of various ethnic minorities.

3. We should critically inherit the classical literary heritage of China and the world from the perspective and method of Marxism-Leninism. Sort out and study ancient and modern Chinese literature, carry forward the excellent traditions of Chinese national culture. Promote international cultural cooperation, strengthen cultural exchanges between countries, and actively participate in the great struggle for world peace and progressive culture.

This is the task of the Writers' Association, and it is also the common goal of our struggle.

The new Writers' Association must be a vibrant and hardworking group of writers; it must be a group that seriously and responsibly leads literary creation and critical activities.

The new Writers' Association has the responsibility to lead us to make the greatest efforts to complete the above tasks, and the comrades of the entire Writers' Association should also regard the completion of the above tasks as their own responsibility.

Comrades: the great era of Mao Zedong has given us the best conditions to give full play to our talents, develop freely, serve the people, and serve the motherland. We live in the great historical period of socialist transformation. In front of us is the beautiful prospect of a socialist society. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the education of communist ideology, we have the confidence to complete the glorious task. The literary potential of our country is limitless, and our team is growing day by day, and we are adding healthy and fresh blood every day. Let us strive for the growth and prosperity of Chinese socialist realism literature, and let us strive for the brilliant and splendid future of New China's literature!

    新的现实和新的任务
    ——一九五三年九月二十五日在中国文学工作者第二次代表大会上的报告
    茅盾各位代表同志：
    自从上次的代表大会成立了“全国文协”以来，四年中间，我们国家的政治、经济、文教建设事业有了伟大的成就。三年的抗美援朝、保卫和平的英勇而艰巨的斗争，已经粉碎了美帝国主义的穷凶极恶的侵略计划，为和平解决朝鲜问题及其他有关问题创造了重要的条件。经过土地改革、镇压反革命、三反、五反等伟大运动的胜利成功，我国社会各方面都发生了巨大的、本质的变化。
    新中国到处充满着生气勃勃的新气象，到处激荡着轰轰烈烈的建设的热潮。
    反侵略战争的胜利，政治、经济、文教方面的成就与发展，民主的社会改革工作的伟大的成功，人民物质生活与文化水平的提高，——这一切，使得我国文学在新的社会基础上获得新的成就和发展。这是我们国家制度的优越性的反映。
    新的社会生活赋予文学以新的内容与形式，改变了文学与群众的关系，培育了新的、生命力充沛的文学队伍。和过去相比，我国文学已同样发生了显著而巨大的变化。
    这种变化和发展，和共产党的领导与关心是分不开的，和毛主席的英明的文艺指导方针是分不开的，和全国的文学战线上全体同志们的努力是分不开的。
    这种变化和发展，首先表现在文学作品的内容上，在作品的题材和主题上，在新的人物形象的创造上。曾经长期渗透在我国文学中的各种反动的腐朽的文学思想，包括封建阶级的和殖民地的文学思想，基本上被清除了。资产阶级的个人主义、自由主义，为艺术而艺术的文学思想，已经从文学上丧失了它们的地位。新中国的文学，在共产主义思想照耀下，显然生气勃勃的，充满着对于祖国建设和人类解放的无限信心与乐观主义精神，由于这样，文学的视野和其所反映的生活范围，就比过去广阔得多了。据我们初步的调查，四年来在全国主要杂志报纸上发表的约两千种小说、散文、通讯报告和剧本，以及放映的电影中，以工业生产和工人生活为题材的约四百种，以农村斗争和农民生活为题材的约四百余种，以抗日战争、解放战争和抗美援朝战争为题材的约三百余种，描写部队生活与军民关系的约三百余种，描写少数民族生活和斗争的约七十种，描写其他各方面社会斗争和社会民主改革运动的约二百种。这些数字虽然还不完整，但显然可以看出新中国文学和过去的相比，是发生了怎样巨大的变化。我们作家从祖国丰富的，沸腾的人民生活和斗争中，吸取了各种各样的新的题材和新的主题，创造出各色各样新的人物的形象，通过他们反映了我们国家各方面新的面貌和其远景。这些题材和主题，在我国若干年以前的文学中是很少出现过，或完全没有出现过的。
    在近年来的作品中间，出现不少成功的和比较优秀的作品。如小说“铜墙铁壁”，描写了解放战争中农民和人民解放军的亲密合作、克服困难、支援前线的斗争，创造出勤劳纯朴、大公无私的农民干部的光辉形象；影片“钢铁战士”和话剧“在战斗里成长”，表现了解放军战士在解放战争中的坚强勇敢、百屈不挠，对于革命事业无限忠诚的高贵品质；如巴金的朝鲜通讯和魏巍的散文“谁是最可爱的人”以及许多反映朝鲜战争的优美的速写、报告、短篇小说，从各种不同的角度，反映了我国志愿军战士的高度国际主义爱国主义的精神和惊人的英雄主义的崇高品质；获得斯大林奖金的小说“太阳照在桑乾河上”、“暴风骤雨”和歌剧“白毛女”，深刻而生动地反映了伟大的土地改革和农村阶级关系的变化，创造了新的农民的优美的形象。话剧“在新事物面前”反映了企业改革中进步与保守力量的斗争。这些作品，在艺术上都获得了一定的成就，在人民群众中产生了广泛的教育作用。
    还值得特别指出的，是我国历史上第一次出现了以少数民族生活为题材、以少数民族的劳动人民的先进人物为主人公的文学作品。我国少数民族的团结、和睦、幸福的新生活，愈来愈多地在文学上反映出来了。其中有不少优秀的作品。少数民族优秀的青年作家已经出现了。
    我们的作品中出现了大量新的人物：解放军和志愿军的战斗英雄、工厂和农村的劳动模范、共产党员、青年团员、新型的妇女和儿童。他们不像过去的作品所写的那样，以被压迫、被剥削者的形象出现，他们是以生活的主人翁、新中国的创造者的形象出现的。这些人物的典型性虽然还不充分，但无论如何是在各种不同程度上显示出新的社会的本质力量，从他们身上反映出中国人民的高贵革命品质和崇高的道德观念，也反映出社会生活的变化，对于人民精神生活所产生的巨大影响和力量。
    由于这样，文学和群众的关系也发生了显著的变化。我们的文学日益广泛地取得了工农兵群众的关怀与支持，文学普及的范围更扩大了。文艺成为他们生活中重要的思想武器。文学书籍的发行数量达到解放前的十倍到二十倍。一九五二年电影观众达到了六亿人次以上。工厂、农村、部队普遍展开了文艺活动。许多作品被群众改编为通俗的戏曲和戏剧，群众也编写许多的曲艺、快板和歌曲。过去和文艺作品没有接触或很少接触的劳动人民今天已成为文艺的基本读者和观众了。广大读者不仅热情地关怀和支持作家的创作活动，并且认真地监督了我们的文学活动。来自读者的意见不但很快，而且非常热烈和尖锐。我们的作家和各个文学刊物的编辑部经常收到大量的来信，对于作品提出了宝贵的意见。工厂、部队、机关、学校的读者，用座谈的方式讨论一部作品的情形，已经愈来愈多。群众热烈地拥护凡有教育意义的、反映了社会发展的本质、表现了具有劳动人民高贵品质的新人物的作品，反对那些歪曲现实，或者没有具体地反映现实、枯燥无味的概念化的作品。群众还经常提出意见，要求我们给他们怎样的作品。
    我们还应当看一看，在我们的队伍中间，发生了怎样的重大的变化。
    四年前，我们对于“为工农兵服务”这一文艺方针的认识还很不一致；一部分作家的认识并且还有错误，因而还发生了工农兵是否必须作为作品的主人公和正面人物的争论。作家思想不纯、立场不稳的现象还很多。一九五一年结合着对于反动的电影“武训传”的批判，展开了全国范围的创作思想的批评与自我批评的热潮；在这基础上，一九五二年开始的全国范围的文艺整风运动，更进一步批判了文学上的资产阶级和小资产阶级思想。与此相结合，进行了作家们深入生活、改造思想的工作。各地最近展开的对于社会主义现实主义的学习，也有一定的收获。这一系列的学习，批评与自我批评，促进了我们队伍的思想、目标和步调的一致，也加强了我们的队伍的团结。新作家以其蓬蓬勃勃的朝气推动了老作家，老作家以其创作经验帮助新作家。老作家都认识到必须站到工人阶级立场、深入群众生活、改造思想，努力为人民服务的重要性；认识到工人阶级的利益和民族利益的不可分。不论党与非党的作家，不论工农出身的作家与小资产阶级出身的作家，不论青年作家与老年作家，经过了文艺整风和思想改造运动，我们的目标更一致了，因而我们的团结也更紧密了。
    四年来，我们的新战士逐渐增多，到今天，已经成为我国文学蓬勃灿烂发展的依靠。
    根据不完全的统计，四年来全国出版的单行本小说共二百五十六种，诗歌共一百五十九种，剧本共二百六十五种，散文及其他共八百九十六种。如果再加上已在各种刊物上发表而还没有单行出版的作品，那总数还要大。这样大量的作品，其作者绝大部分是新进作家。值得注意的是工农作家，他们的作品受到群众的欢迎。文学战线上新队伍的形成与发展，说明了我国文学的潜在力量的深厚。这些新进作家，极大部分是青年，他们的作品虽然还不大成熟，但他们是从工农群众中来的，经过斗争的锻炼的，熟悉并热爱劳动人民的，对新事物新人物有锐敏的感觉的，对祖国的建设和社会主义改造的必然胜利抱着无限的信心的。在共产党和人民的培养之下，他们的前途是远大的，我国社会主义现实主义的文学，主要将依靠这一新的队伍而成长，因此对于他们的帮助和教育，成为当前重要任务之一。
    四年来，文学上这些成就，深刻而巨大的变化，首先是说明了工人阶级的先进思想，已经在我国文学事业上取得了确定不移的领导地位，共产党和毛主席对于文学运动的关心和指示，特别是一九五一年党中央关于批判“武训传”的指示，对于近年来中国文学的发展是具有重大意义的。文学运动只有在工人阶级思想领导之下，在共产党政策指导之下，方能取得它正确的发展。
    但是，四年来我们文学上的这种巨大的变化和新的气象，还仅仅是开端。和我们国家的政治、经济建设的速度相比，和人民生活的日新月异相比，和群众对于文艺的要求相比，我们的文学工作还远远地落在现实的后面。最多只能说，我们是为更好地完成新的任务，打下了一个初步的基础。
    文学工作落后于现实，自然有其客观的原因，如全国解放初期，由于国家工作的需要，许多文学工作者，参加了政府及其他部门的行政工作，因而减弱了文学战线上的力量。但是主要的应该说是我们工作中还存在着许多主观上的缺点。首先表现在我们作品的思想性和艺术性一般还不够高。我们若干作品中虽然也描写了新的人物，但是这些人物往往缺乏强烈的艺术感染的力量，和现实生活中每天在出现着的那些光辉的英雄人物相比，我们作品里的英雄，不是更鲜明，反而显得减色。还有一些作品中的人物，只能说是作者的概念的化身，而不是生活本身的形象，由于这样，这些作品就很难做到凭借艺术形象去表现出作品的政治思想力量，和有效地发挥以社会主义精神去教育和改造劳动人民的作用。我们许多作品虽然也描写了新的生活，但是往往只是现象的罗列，而不是把这些生活现象按照毛主席所说的“集中起来，把其中的矛盾和斗争典型化”。我们许多作家还不能大胆地去表现社会生活各方面的矛盾，深入到矛盾的内部，去描写新的形势下复杂的阶级斗争的动态。他们往往不是从这些矛盾斗争面前轻轻滑开了，就是用主观的方法把矛盾轻易地“解决”了，因而复杂的、丰富的社会现象，在作家笔下简单化了，片面化了，变成了干瘪的公式。这就是普遍被指责的概念化和公式化的倾向。
    文学工作的缺点，还表现在文学形式的单调和粗糙，对于语言和结构的不重视；表现在理论和批评的落后。我们许多作家和批评家还不善于熟练地和谨严地去使用我们文学的武器。
    文学工作者协会对于上述一切缺点的基本责任，就是缺乏对于文学思想的领导，这就使得上述缺点不能得到及时的和适当的克服。
    对于这些缺点的分析以及克服的方法，我将放在后面去讨论。这里应该指出的，即是这些缺点的存在，使我们绝无理由可以对于上面所说一些工作成绩感到自满（自然也不能和不应该自馁）。这些缺点曾经使我们的工作和我们的任务不能相称，而现在随着革命的发展，新的历史任务又摆在我们面前了。这新的任务是更加艰巨和复杂的，如果我们不是大家努力地积极地来克服这些缺点，改变这种情况，那末文学工作落后于现实的状态不仅将继续下去，而且其距离将越来越大。这次大会的任务，就是要来讨论和解决这样的问题。同志们，我们相信这些缺点和困难是能够克服的。我们应该实事求是地来估计我们已有的成绩，吸取已往的经验，同时毫不迟疑地坚决地来克服缺点，改进工作，满怀信心来迎接我们国家新的历史时期的新的任务。
    什么是我们新的任务呢？我们国家现在是处在实现国家社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的时期。无论哪一部门工作，无论哪一方面战线，都应该为完成国家社会主义工业化和社会主义改造这个总的政治任务而斗争。
    这个斗争是艰巨而复杂的，但是一定会胜利的。在这个过渡时期中，我们要继续和国外的帝国主义作斗争，和国内残余的潜伏的反革命分子作斗争。在人民的内部我们还要进行对于资本主义工商业的逐步改造，也就是在联合的条件下对资产阶级进行斗争，并且还要对于几万万农民和手工业者进行改造的教育。在这样的社会主义改造过程中，我们社会的阶级关系将产生比过去更深刻的变化，在社会的精神生活上也将反映出这种错综万状的变化。
    文学的任务不仅要从作品中去真实地反映这些错综万状的变化，而尤其重要的，是要以艺术的力量推进社会主义的改造工作，就是说，要以社会主义的思想去教育、改造千百万人民，用劳动人民的高尚品质和英雄气概去鼓舞他们前进的勇气和信心，同时，要坚决地对残余的封建主义和帝国主义的思想影响作斗争，要对资本主义的思想作斗争，要对于抵抗社会主义改造的各种思想作斗争，对人民中间的各种怕困难、保守自私等落后意识作斗争；这都是摆在我们面前的重要课题。我们的工作就是要以文学的真实描写去教导广大人民不仅正确地认识今天的现实，并且认识明天的现实，教导他们在这种复杂的阶级斗争中，改造自己克服障碍，担负起建设祖国，逐步过渡到社会主义社会的伟大历史任务。
    要实践这样的任务，那末我们的文学就首先不能不是以社会主义思想为内容的文学，我们的作家就不能不是社会主义者或努力把自己改造成为社会主义者。我们要教育人民正确地认识现实，使他们向前看而不是向后看，就必须要求我们的作品能够真实地具体地反映现实，不但表现出人民的今天，并且要展望到人民的明天，要照亮他们前进的道路——一句话，要通过文学作品给人民以社会主义的思想教育。
    由于这样，每个作家就必须严格地要求自己遵照社会主义现实主义的创作方法去进行工作，必须严格要求自己更好地学习社会主义现实主义，要求自己成为马克思列宁主义的好学生。
    曾经有些人怀疑：这个要求是否过高？我以为这种怀疑是不必要的，这种怀疑是由于有些人对于社会主义现实主义的不够了解。事实上，社会主义现实主义在我国文学上并不是一个新的问题，“五四”以来中国革命的文学运动，就是在工人阶级思想领导下沿着社会主义现实主义的方向发展过来的。特别从一九四二年毛主席在延安文艺座谈会讲话以后，更明确的奠定了中国文学上社会主义现实主义的理论基础，因而把“五四”以来的工人阶级领导的中国文学运动推进到一个新阶段。毛主席在延安文艺座谈会的讲话中，所指示的关于创作上的原则，包括作家的立场与观点，服务的对象，作家与群众的关系，作家对于生活和学习的态度，对于接受文化传统的态度，以及关于典型的创造，关于批评的方法等等，难道不就是社会主义现实主义的原则吗？许多年来，我们大家努力为毛泽东的文艺方向而奋斗，很少听见有人说过这是“过高”的要求，为什么现在对于社会主义现实主义的口号，就觉得是“过高”的要求呢？
    应该指出，我们中间还有些同志，对于共产党和毛主席的文艺方针，还没有能够很深刻地体会，因而产生了一些人的这种怀疑。正因为如此，我们就应该加强对于社会主义现实主义的学习研究和宣传，应该着重地提出这一问题，把它作为我们创作和批评实践上的共同方向和目标。
    人们中间也许还存在这样一个错误的想法，以为我们国家现在还没有进入社会主义的社会，为什么要强调文学上的社会主义现实主义呢？
    这样的错误想法是必须澄清的。要知道，第一，即使并不描写社会主义社会，一个社会主义作家的创作方法仍然应当是社会主义现实主义的，例如阿·托尔斯泰之写“彼得大帝”或者高尔基之写“母亲”，都是如此。第二，我国今天并不是还没有社会主义，相反的，在今天我国的政治、经济、文化等各方面，社会主义的强大的领导力量，都是早已经存在并且正在迅速地发展着的。今天我国的现实生活中不但已经有巨大的社会主义企业，而且已经有大批的英勇的先进者正在为社会主义社会的实现而创造条件，已经涌现了千千万万的劳动人民具有社会主义者的高贵品质。一个社会主义现实主义作家必须要求自己善于觉察出生活发展的方向和新事物的萌芽，善于从革命发展中去表现生活；一个社会主义现实主义作家的职责正是必须要把在今天看来还不是普遍存在，然而明天必将普遍存在的事物，加以表现。不会正确地看到今天和明天的现实，就不能正确地表现今天和明天的现实，这样的作家就不可能成为好的现实主义者。
    为了能够很好地担负起我们的任务，我们必须明确肯定社会主义现实主义的方法，必须坚定不移地向这个方向去努力。
    但这也并不是说，今天就要求每一个作品都能够达到高度的社会主义现实主义的水准。这样要求是脱离实际的。要使我们的文学沿着社会主义现实主义的道路健全地发展和成长，必须有学习和锻炼的过程，需要从创作实践中一步一步去提高我们的水平，并且充分发展作家的风格的多样性。因此，如果脱离作家的实际，以一种教条主义的方法，向任何作家要求某一特定的社会主义现实主义的“标准”或“规格”，这是要不得的，这种批评方法，本身就不是社会主义现实主义的，而是主观主义的。
    可是，在另一方面，我们也不应该以这样那样的理由，去拒绝沿着社会主义现实主义方向前进；对于我们创作中那些违反工人阶级和人民利益的思想，反集体主义的倾向和反现实主义的倾向，不能采取熟视无睹的态度。对于我们工作上的缺点，必须采取正确的批评与自我批评的方法去克服和纠正。因为社会主义现实主义的原则，只有是从创作实践中通过经常不断的学习和思想斗争，才能获得胜利的发展。
    前面我已经指出，在我们目前文学工作中，还存在着许多缺点，我们必须来分析这些缺点，来研究如何克服这些缺点，并为今后的努力指出具体的途径。
    首先是创作方法的问题。在创作上，我们好久以前就已经注意到，但直到现在还普遍存在着的，就是作品的概念化和公式化的倾向。
    概念化和公式化都是主观主义思想的产物。它们是一对双生的兄弟。这种创作方法是违反现实主义的根本原则的，因为它忘记了“革命的文艺是人民生活在革命作家头脑中的反映的产物”，忘记了现实的人民的生活是文学艺术的唯一源泉。它不是从客观的现实出发，而是从作者主观的概念出发，它把复杂而丰富的现实生活简单化为几个概念所构成的公式，其结构是所谓落后、对比、转变三段法，人物形象则有一定的几张“脸谱”，不论所写的是工厂，或是农村，不论主题是增加生产，或是争取婚姻自由，都可套用这样的公式。这样的作品当然就不可能有真实性和具体性，当然也不会被群众所喜欢。这样作品之所以产生，根本的原因是作家脱离了人民群众的生活，用闭户造车的方法去写作。这种情况自然是最坏的，但一般说还不是最普遍的。更普遍的情况，是作家也经历了一定的生活体验，也到工厂、部队或农村里去了，也掌握了一定的实际材料，但是所写出的作品，往往仍然给群众一种概念的印象，而很少有艺术的力量，对于这种情况，我们是更需要加以分析和研究的。
    首要的问题我以为是对于人物性格创造的问题。现实主义的真实性，主要是通过人物性格的创造而表现。恩格斯说：“照我看来，现实主义是除了细节的真实之外还要正确地表现出典型环境中的典型性格。”所以典型环境中的典型性格是现实主义创作方法的根本问题。但是我们有些作家往往把这个根本问题忽略了，他们往往从生活中间抓住一些表面现象，抓住一大堆还没有经过头脑消化的材料，来不及等到人物在自己胸中酝酿成熟，就性急地预先为自己规定了主题，然后按照需要去寻求人物，或者按照一种公式去填写人物。这样的人物性格特征，就是高尔基所说，是从外部贴上去的。这样的人物，当然就不可能有明朗的个性和血肉的感情，也就不会产生艺术的感染力量。我们有些作家常常花了更多的精力去考虑主题是否正确，这自然是好的，可是他恰巧忘记了如何通过描写人物性格以及性格与环境的关系去表现他的主题，结果使他的主题仍然不能很好表达出来。这样的情况可以说是相当普遍的，今年电影创作会议上所讨论的一些作品中，最主要的就是犯了上述这种毛病。
    尤其要特别指出的，是我们的许多作品对于正面的英雄人物性格刻划的乏力。在许多电影、小说、剧本中出现的英雄人物，特别是领导人物，往往是缺乏个性，缺乏感情，缺乏思想的光辉，这种人物常常是以说教者或演讲者的姿态出场，高高地孤立于群众之上，被偶像化了的，正如马克思所斥责，“这种神化了的拉斐尔画像，是失却了一切描写的真实性的”。这种情况之所以产生，主要是我们作家对于新的英雄人物还不够熟悉，还没有能够去发掘出他们的高贵品质和典型的、正面的特质，因而也不能有意识地去夸张和凸出地去刻划。我们作家虽然也还是访问了、观察了现实生活中的一些英雄人物，搜集了许许多多他们英雄事迹的资料，但是由于我们并没有真正从内在生活中去理解他们，从斗争中认识他们发展的过程，甚至对于他们还缺乏一种衷心热爱的感情，因而在描写他们的时候，仍然不免用自己主观的概念去代替，或者用一种东补西贴的方法去描写，结果英雄人物丧失了生活的光彩，成为毫无生命的形象。
    我们知道，英雄人物的性格总是从斗争中间发展的。没有斗争，也就不会产生英雄。凡是不能或不大胆去表现革命与反革命、进步与落后力量的斗争的，不是把英雄人物放在斗争的中心去描写的，就不可能创造出鲜明、生动，使群众激动鼓舞的形象。而因此，在描写这种斗争的时候，对于反面人物的描写也是必要的。但是在我们有些作品中间，英雄人物常常是离开斗争的中心孤立地去描写的。他们不是站在斗争的前列，而是站在斗争的后面或外面。作者虽然也竭力企图去塑造他们的性格，表现他们的特征，描写他们的生活细节，但是由于离开矛盾和斗争去描写他们，因此这种人物的性格常常是不发展的，从头到尾是一样的；人物性格和斗争的环境似乎是没有多大关系，和作品的主题是没有多大联系的；作者只是为了描写性格而在描写性格，而不是从典型环境中创造性格，因此既不能从他们身上看出时代斗争的深刻内容，也不能从斗争的行进中去看出反映于他们性格上的阶级本质的特征；甚至他们中间的一些人物，对于作品来说，是可有可无的。在这类作品中，对于反面的或被批判的人物也常常是无力的、概念的、丑角化了的。由于这样，就削弱了作品的真实性。
    其次，和人物创造不能分开的另一个重要的问题，是如何表现生活中的矛盾和冲突。社会主义现实主义要求作家从革命的发展中真实地和历史具体地去描写现实，所以“文学和艺术必须大胆地表现生活的矛盾和冲突，必须善于使用批评的武器，把它当做一个有效的教育工具”（马林科夫）。而我们许多作家常常缺少这样一种大胆，缺少这样一种战斗性。我们常常是在生活矛盾和冲突前面轻易地避开了，或者是把复杂的矛盾简单化了。或者是用一种公式方法来解决了。例如今天我国农村中间，一方面是广大农民已经脱离了封建的剥削而成为工人阶级争取社会主义斗争中的最巩固的同盟军了，而另一方面大量小生产的个体经济仍然存在，个体经济的思想仍然有它的历史基础，我国的农业技术还处在落后的状态，因此在加强工农联盟的基础上，农村中间个体经济思想与集体经济思想的矛盾，决不是一个很简单的问题。在社会主义改造时期中，教育农民无疑地是个极其复杂的任务。我们作家必须现实地去认识和对待这些问题的复杂性。决不能那样轻易地把这些矛盾看作一天早晨就可以解决的问题。可是在我们若干描写农业生产合作社和互助组的作品中，却常常把这些矛盾通过一些喜剧的方法，简便地解决了。从这样的作品中，我们很难看出今天农村中生活真实的面貌，似乎农业集体化的斗争已经是一条康庄大道而无需这样那样艰苦地努力了。
    在描写战争的作品中，也有同样的情形，为了表现解放军的英勇，而往往把敌人过分的写得不堪一击，因而把敌我斗争的艰苦性和其胜利的伟大意义反而掩盖住了。在有些作品中，作者为要表现战斗中的乐观主义精神而采用了大量的日常生活中的“逗乐”和“开玩笑”的描写，其结果反而冲淡了战争的气氛，显得没有力量。事实是，只有表现了艰苦的战斗，才能够更凸出地表现出战斗的英勇和战斗的乐观主义，否则就削弱了战争的真实感，并且也造成了人物性格的模糊。
    在描写其他方面题材的作品中，也有类似的情况。
    由于不敢去大胆地表现生活的矛盾和冲突，在我们中间也还缺乏揭露和讽刺反面人物和落后现象的作品。这就是说我们还没有能够充分地发挥文学的力量，无情地去烧毁生活中一切腐朽和垂死的东西，一切阻碍进步的东西。
    这种现象，应当怎样来解释呢？
    基本的原因自然是作家对于现实认识的不足，他们或是看不见或是不理解什么是现实生活中的矛盾，缺乏明彻的观察力，缺乏对于现实生活的研究，缺乏独立的分析和概括、判断的能力。由于政治修养的不足，生活经验的狭小，常常被现实的表象所迷眩了，看不到生活本质的东西，自然也就不能区别本质与非本质的东西，看不到全面的东西，自然也就不能掌握全面与局部的关系，因此他们虽然到了生活中去，却只是见了树木不见森林，这样自然就很难在作品中去深刻地反映出生活中的矛盾了。
    也有一些作家，未始不是看见了生活的矛盾和斗争，但由于他不能站稳工人阶级的立场，不是全心全意投到火热的斗争中，缺乏那种高度的战斗的精神，因此他就不敢大胆去接触这些矛盾，不敢深入去挖掘这些矛盾，他生怕犯错误，在一种“但求无过”的心理状态下，觉得既无十分把握，还是不写或少写为妙。这在作品上就表现为对待矛盾采取轻轻掠过，或故意回避的态度。
    也还有一些作家，担心描写了人民内部的矛盾，是否“暴露”了人民的缺点呢？这完全是一种误解。我们表现了生活中的矛盾，正是为了表现出我们现实中作为矛盾主导力量的先进势力对于残余的落后势力的克服过程，正是由于表现了这样的矛盾，才显示出我们先进势力的强大。自然，这首先要求作者站稳工人阶级的立场，具有一种对生活的高度信心。如果作者自己就缺乏这种对生活的信心。而且带着一种对生活怀疑的、阴暗的心情，那他就不会正确地去认识和反映现实生活的斗争。
    马林科夫同志告诉我们说：“我们的作家和艺术家必须在作品中无情地抨击在社会中仍然存在的恶习、缺点和不健康现象，必须创造正面的艺术形象，表现新型人物光辉灿烂的人格，从而帮助培养我国社会的人们具有与资本主义所产生的毒疮和恶习完全绝缘的性格和习惯。”这就是我们社会主义现实主义文学的任务。正因为如此，我们必须反对在创作上那种“无冲突论”或类似“无冲突论”的倾向，反对那种脱离生活去描写生活的倾向；必须把从表现生活矛盾中去创造人物，作为现实主义的重要课题。
    最后，是关于作家认识生活的问题。文学的特征是从生活的认识出发，通过艺术的思维，达到生活形象的创造，凭借这样的创造来达到实践其教育改造人民的任务。因此认识生活问题对于现实主义的创作是个更带根本性质的问题。要克服创作上的概念化和公式化，提高我们作品的现实主义水平，这是首先的关键。近两年来，许多作家都深入到工厂、农村、部队等各方面生活中去。其他许多作家也都热烈地要求深入生活。这是很好的现象。而正是从这种深入生活的实践中间，作家如何认识生活的问题便更实际地被提出了。
    在我们中间，有一种相当普遍的情形，就是着重于生活的观察和体验，而比较忽略了对于社会生活的研究和分析。我们常常说：“下去体验生活”。自然，体验是十分重要的，知识分子所缺乏的往往是工农群众生活的感性知识，但是如果不是把观察、体验生活和研究、分析生活统一起来，那末我们还是很难做到把复杂的生活现象概括和集中起来。许多作家在下去以后，常常最初是感觉新鲜，慢慢地就感觉有些茫然，我想这是和缺乏对于生活的研究、分析工作有关系的。我们知道，社会生活是整体的，无论工厂、农村、部队的生活，都不可能和整个社会及其发展分割开来。一个作家需要有对某一方面生活更多的知识，而同时还需要有广博的各方面社会生活的知识，还需要有一定的社会历史知识，这样才使他能够全面地历史地来分析研究局部现象，从局部现象去看到全面，从一定人物或事件来反映出广阔的时代风貌和精神。如果仅仅局限在“体验生活”的范围，就可能会使我们停留在一些表面现象的认识上，从而我们所表现出来的，也仅能是这些生活的表象。
    我们到某一个工厂或农村中间，把这一个工厂或农村，作为我们生活根据地，这是完全有必要的。但这也并不等于说，我们的世界就是这一个工厂或农村，我们的视野就局限在这个工厂或农村之内。所谓生活根据地的意思，是要我们从对于某种生活环境的特殊熟悉条件下，能够更深入更具体地去观察、研究生活的各方面。一个作家必须有历史唯物主义的观点，必须有世界的和历史的胸襟，有高眺远瞩的视力，而同时又有具体的丰博的生活经验与知识，有工人阶级的英雄气概，同时又有实事求是的精神。这样才能使我们的作品具有广阔的内容和丰富的色彩。目前我们作品中普遍存在的内容和风格的单调和狭隘，应该说是和我们有些作家对于认识生活的狭隘和庸俗观点是多少有关系的。
    无论观察、体验和分析、研究生活，一个作家必须是“火热的斗争”的实践者，而不能是旁观者。所谓斗争的实践者的意思，还不仅是表示于作家是否在工厂或农村、部队担任了一定的实际工作，而更主要的是他是否以先进者的立场和高度的战斗热情去对待他的生活与工作。如果缺乏这样的立场和热情，则即使担任一定的工作，仍然是一种旁观者的心境，那同样也不能使他从斗争中更深刻地去观察、体验、研究和分析生活。
    作家在群众生活中，应该不要忘记他自己劳动的特殊任务，人类灵魂工程师的任务。在适当时期中担任一定工作是好的，但他应该随时随地在进行对于一切人物、生活和斗争的观察、体验、分析和研究。在观察、体验、分析、研究的同时，并应尽可能的写出一些报道、速写等形式的短小作品。但是千万不要本着一种主观的急于求成的心情，刚刚一到群众生活中间就匆匆忙忙替自己规定出了二十万字或三十万字的题材计划；这样的计划是相当危险的。
    认识生活和研究党的理论和政策，是不可分的，因为党的理论和政策正是从群众生活斗争中概括和集中起来的、具有高度的客观真实性的指导原则。一个作家如果不是认真地去研究党的理论和政策，也就不会很好地去理解群众的生活斗争；同时，如果他不是认真去研究生活，也就不会很好地懂得政策，反映政策。对于在群众中生活的作家们来说，由于他们更直接参加群众生活斗争，这种理论和政策的研究，尤其有实际的意义。但应该指出，党的理论和政策只是作为我们去观察、体验、分析、研究生活的指针，而并不能以政策条文去代替生活，去代替文学上的现实主义。公式主义者按照政策条文去安排情节、布置人物，这样既不是研究政策，也不是认识生活，用这样廉价的方法写出的东西，也决不会是文学作品。
    以上所说的几个问题，我以为是目前创作上比较主要的几个问题，这些问题我们相信是可以解决的，我们的缺点是可以克服的。
    为了克服目前创作上的缺点，提高我们作品的思想性和艺术性，实践社会主义现实主义的创作原则，使我们的创作能够胜任地担负起我们时代的使命，应该要求我们的作家把创造人物性格的问题，特别是创造正面人物的艺术形象问题，提到我们创作的首要地位上来。我们国家的伟大生活中，每天都在出现着像黄继光、张明山、李顺达、郝建秀一类的英雄人物。他们以他们的高贵品质和英勇行为激励鼓舞了全国人民，而在我们文学篇幅中，还很少出现这样英雄的艺术形象。这是我们工作中的巨大缺点。我们应该把他们的生活形象比实际存在的更强烈地、更集中地、更典型地、更理想地、更有生气地在小说中、电影中、戏剧中、诗歌中描写出来，通过他们更广泛地有力地去教育和鼓舞千百万劳动人民。同时我们也应该深刻地来描写那些反面的、敌对的人物的形象，引起人民对于他们的仇恨和警惕。
    应该要求作家们用阶级斗争的精神，大胆地来反映我国社会主义改造时期中社会生活的各种矛盾，通过这些矛盾来教育人民，知道什么是正在产生的、新的、前进的、不可阻挡的力量，什么是垂死的、旧的、腐朽的力量，从而来促进新生力量的加速生长和旧的腐朽的力量的加速死亡。
    应该要求作家们更广阔地更自由地更丰富多彩地来描写我们社会各方面的生活，更广阔地选择作品的主题和题材，创造多样的形式和风格。
    为了实践上述要求，作家们应该继续的深入社会生活，学会用社会主义者的观点和态度去认真地观察、体验、分析、研究一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切文学艺术的原始材料；应该更努力去学习马克思列宁主义，学习党的政策，继续努力思想改造，以加强我们思想的武装，提高我们的政治水平。政治学习和生活实践，对于作家来说，无论什么时候，都是最基本的问题。
    同志们，我们祖国伟大的生活是如此灿烂，我们的劳动人民是如此英勇智慧，我们文学的源泉是如此广阔丰富，只要我们认真努力，我们是完全能够写出无愧于我们时代的作品的！
    为了提高我们作品的艺术水平，作家的另一个重要的任务，是精通和锻炼我们艺术表现的技巧。一篇完整的艺术作品，必须具有严谨的结构，对于人物和环境的生动的描写，纯洁和富于表现力的文学语言；在诗歌方面，还须有优美的音节和韵律。作品的艺术技巧不是和作品的思想内容分立的，而是从属于内容，服务于内容的。作品的结构和人物的描写本身就是思想的表现。离开思想内容，只依靠技术，是不能表达什么的。因此我们必须坚决反对资产阶级那种纯技术观点和形式主义。但是在另一方面，如果以为作品可以不要依靠一定的技术就能够生动地表达出正确的思想内容，这好比只要有战略思想而无需掌握作战技术一样，其结果无疑还是要打败仗的。因此我们又必须同时坚决反对那种轻视技巧或否认技巧的错误倾向。此外还有一种错误看法：承认技巧是需要的，但又以为过去的所谓技巧都是封建阶级或资产阶级的，不合于我们的需要，因而我们必须“白手起家”。从这样的想法，产生了漠视古典文学的倾向。大家都熟悉这一句金言：
  “如果没有清清楚楚了解到，只有确切通晓人类全部发展过程所创造的文化，只有改造这种已往的文化，才能建设无产阶级的文化。”（列宁）在文学技巧这问题上，我们所应遵循的，也是这样一个方针。也就是说，我们要遵循毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中所明白指出的继承遗产、发扬优良传统的方针。当然，继承遗产发扬文学传统，主要是继承古典文学中的人民性和现实主义精神，其范围是比学习技巧要大得多的。
    应该指出，在我们目前的创作中，对于技巧问题的注意是太不够了。结构的混乱和松懈，语言的不纯洁和拖沓，成为相当普遍的现象，许多很好的题材，往往因此而损害了。由于缺乏熟练的文学技术，许多作品教人读起来，感到沉闷，没有生气，因而也就丧失了或减弱了它鼓舞感染的作用。
    一篇作品应当是一个完整的有机体。这就是说，作品的人物、情节的描写，都不是可以随便增删的。也就是说，作家在处理人物、情节、环境描写等等的时候，应当精心计划，该有的就必须有，该去的就必须去，该长的就必须长，该短的就必须短。这样的工作，叫做“剪裁”，是写作中一个重要的工作。
    我们的多数作品在这方面的功夫是很差的。有些作者似乎根本没有想到素材必须经过提炼，必须按作品的主题的需要加以剪裁。他们往往是有多少材料就用多少，不问精粗，也不管必要和不必要，统统塞进去就算了事，结果使得作品的结构臃肿松弛，不成格局，人物济济，一大半倒是可有可无，或者是“有不如无”的冗员；环境描写与故事的发展和人物的情绪互不配合，因而也就起不了衬托渲染的作用。
    环境描写必须与人物的行动和感情联系起来。孤立地描写环境，便成为贴在人物背后的一张“布景”。应当通过人物的行动、人物的眼睛、人物的情绪与当前环境的交互感应，来灵活地描写。我国的古典文学中有不少这类值得学习的例子。虽然那些生活离开我们已经很远了，但是那些作品中所描写的环境和人物，对于我们，仍然是那么清楚那么生动，似乎是面对面可以感觉到的。我们许多古典作品在使用文学语言上是异常经济的。像“水浒传”、“红楼梦”、“儒林外史”等小说，往往用一二千字的篇幅，写出非常生动的场面。中国的旧诗，常用几十个字写出全部的意境，尤其具有不可比拟的精炼。这种传统，应该为我们所积极学习和研究。
    托尔斯泰曾经告诉过我们：要学会消除艺术散文中的“臃肿”和发展“肌肉”。这是非常重要的，事实是我们许多作品中“臃肿”太多，而“肌肉”太少了。
    对于人物的生动的描写，是艺术表现技巧中另一个重要的项目。人物描写，是为要写出性格及其发展，因此就需要从具体行动以及支配这些行动的思想情绪来写人物，要从故事的发展来写人物的成长，而且要从各种角度去写，以免把一个人物写得片面、单调、枯燥无味。
    因为不善于从人物的行动中刻划人物，有些作品就致力于人物外形的描写，企图由此给读者一个印象。人物的外形当然也应该写，可是不能把这当作描写人物的主要方法。有些作品中人物外形的描写也很潦草，或者公式化。有时还强调人物的形貌或举动上的一二特征，企图由此衬托他的性格。特征当然也可以写，但是不应当因此而使得人物丑角化。
    主要人物和次要人物的安排，也常常不大被注意。有些次要人物似乎只是用来衬托主要人物的，他本身没有独立的存在，他在作品中的作用跟戏剧中的“道具”差不多。而相反，也有过多地描写了次要人物，因而损害了主要人物的情形。
    素材的剪裁、故事的组织和人物的描写是一种细致的劳动，不是经过反复的修改是很难得到完整的。有些作品的艺术上的粗糙，不一定是由于作家才能的限制，而只是由于粗心和草率，由于不肯花更多的修改的劳动。在这里，我们必须记住毛主席对我们的指示：“文章是客观事物的反映，而事物是曲折复杂的，必须反复研究，才能反映恰当；在这里粗心大意，就是不懂得做文章的起码知识。”（反对党八股）
    在文学技巧上另一个重要的问题是语言问题。
    文学作品的基本材料是语言。文学作品的语言应当是形象化的、富有表现力的、准确的和精炼的，然后可以传达作者所欲传达的思想情绪，然后可以构成鲜明的形象。要表达一定的思想情绪，就必须用字正确，造句合法（语法），必须选择适当的字，运用适当的句子。“语汇”贫乏，句法缺少变化，就会使得作品呆板枯燥，没有吸引力。反之，堆砌浮词，无原则地造作古怪的句法，就会使得作品拖沓、芜杂、生硬，使人不能卒读。我们不能不承认，这两种毛病是同样普遍地存在着的。
    语法不通，用字不当，这是初学写作者的通病。其根源在于我们学校中的语文教学没有做好。至于“语汇”的贫乏，有经验的作家也不能免。大家常常都用同样的一些“语汇”，好像已经成为习惯，从没想到应该另找新的语汇。应当记着，旧语汇的滥用常常会造成恶劣的错误。如用“鬼哭狼嚎”一类字样来描写我们人民在敌人轰炸下的情形，用“像切西瓜般的”来形容敌人对我们人民的残杀，就是完全不能容忍的。自然，新的语汇也不允许滥用。如有这样的句子：“眼泪劈劈拍拍直掉”。用“劈劈拍拍”来形容眼泪的既多且急，这就不免是新奇到失当了。创新是件好事，但不能不下苦功。贪图省事，随便创新，就会把好事也弄坏了。
    怎样才可以丰富我们的“语汇”呢？毛主席早已指示：“要向人民群众学习语言。人民的语汇是很丰富的，生动活泼的，表现实际生活的。”“要从外国语言中吸收我们所需要的成份。我们不是硬搬或滥用外国语言，是要吸收外国语言中的好东西，于我们适用的东西。”“我们还要学习古人语言中有生命的东西。由于我们没有努力学习语言，古人语言中的许多还有生气的东西我们就没有充分的合理的利用。当然我们坚决反对去用已经死了的语汇和典故，这是确定了的，但是好的仍然有用的东西还是应该继承。”（反对党八股）
    事实证明：我们并没有正确地认真地照着毛主席的指示去做。
    特别是“学习古人语言中有生命的东西”这件事，我们的努力很不够。不但文艺青年，甚至不少的作家，对于我国古典文学是不重视的。“水浒传”，鲁迅的作品，看是看了，但肯用苦功去研究学习的恐怕很少。鲁迅的作品是尽量注意利用了古人语言中还有生气的东西的，现在我们的大多数作品中连鲁迅所已利用过的，也没有继承，更不用说自己去发掘了。但是，另一方面：“已经死了的语汇和典故”，在我们这里却并未绝迹。
     比较认真，而且做出了一定的成绩的，是学习人民的语言。近年来的优秀作品，都有这一特点。极大部分的新作家的作品如果没有从人民语言中吸收营养，那“语汇”恐怕还要显得贫乏。但是，另一方面，不必要的滥用方言，不经过选择原封不动的搬用社会生活中一些不健康语言的倾向，也很普遍。庸俗趣味的“歇后语”，也被经常地采用。“歇后语”不过是语言游戏，并不是文学语言。滥用方言和“歇后语”的结果，非但不能达到丰富语汇的目的，反而使得文学语言流于粗糙庞杂。我们要丰富我们的“语汇”，但同时也要注意保持我们祖国语文的纯洁。
    社会主义现实主义要求作家，按照其自己的兴趣，选择各种各样的体裁，创造各种各样的风格。因此，积极地创造能够充分反映新的生活内容而为群众所喜闻乐见的形式，是我们文学工作的重要任务之一。这种艺术形式方面的创造性的成就，就是个别作家和作品的独特的风格。鲁迅的作品就有他个人的卓越的风格。我们现在的许多作品可说是缺乏独特风格的。张三的作品如果换上李四的名字，也认不出到底是谁写的。这就说明了我们在作品的形式方面多么缺乏创造力。社会主义现实主义的创作方法不但不是妨碍，而是要求我们创造和发展文学风格的多样性。
    我们还要求发展文学的各种样式，如电影剧本、歌剧、歌曲、说唱文学等更具有普及作用的文学样式，在目前还没有被许多作家所采用。电影剧本特别缺乏。我们要求更多的作家来重视这方面的创作。
    加强和改进文学批评工作，是促进社会主义现实主义文学成长和发展的重要条件。
    这几年来，我们的文学批评工作，对于文学的创作活动，起过了一定的积极的作用：曾经通过对于具体作品的批评，与资产阶级、小资产阶级的文艺思想进行了斗争；曾经批评了违反现实主义的创作方法，曾经批评了若干作品中间非工人阶级的思想和情感。曾经对于新的来自工农兵的作家们的作品，给予极大的重视，及时地作了宣传和介绍，从而鼓舞了工农作家的写作热情。
    但从整个来看，文学批评工作是有严重缺点的，而且比创作还要落后。文学批评工作还没有充分发挥它的指导创作的作用，还没有更有效地完成它的帮助作家、教育作家的任务。
    我们的文学批评，常常不是全面地具体地分析作品内容，而是主观主义的教条式的批评，片面式的批评；光指责作品的缺点而没有肯定它的同时存在着的优点；或者，单称道了作品的优点而不能指出其基本缺点。对于作品思想性与艺术性的全面、细致而科学的分析，十分不够。若干具有全国影响的作品，在出版很久以后也还没有看到批评界的反应。对于创作上的一些问题的论争，也还不能常常及时地予以总结。
    对于新作家的指导和帮助，也是作得很不够的。各刊物编辑部几乎化了大部分的精力和时间来阅读青年作家的投稿，给它们提意见，各编辑部的同志们是够辛苦的。但是从整个看来，我们这项工作是不能令人满意的。四年来，很少针对着青年作家的一般情况而加以分析、指导的专论。对于文学遗产的学习，我们不是不常常提到，然而没有通过文学批评，举具体的事例，来引起作家们普遍的重视，特别是没有引起一般青年作家们的重视。
    还应当指出：有些批评家对于作家常常缺乏一种爱护的热情、帮助的态度，缺乏一种合作的态度，而采取一种粗暴的打击的态度。这种粗暴态度，表现在批评家没有用客观的科学的态度来研究分析他的批评对象，而只凭一时主观的印象匆忙地作了判断；表现在批评家对于作品所表现的社会生活缺乏深入的全面的知识，而只以一些革命文艺理论的原则作为教条、作为公式，来硬套他的批评对象；表现在批评家没有耐心研究整个作品的各方面，而只断章取义地抓住作品中突出的缺点，就下了不公平的、不能使人信服的论断。
    还应该指出：主观主义教条式的批评，由于它不是从客观现实出发，来衡量作品，因而在某种程度上，它不但不能解决问题，并且还使得作家们会跟着它也按着一定的公式去写作，其结果，促成了作品的公式化、概念化倾向的发展。
    也还应该指出：有些批评家不是从实际的创作水平出发，而是急躁地向作家特别是青年作家，提出不适当的过高的要求。有些批评家是用一些固定的标尺，机械地去衡量一切作品，因此引起作家对批评家的畏惧和不满。这样的批评不是鼓舞作家的创造热情，而是阻碍了这个热情。有些缺乏自信的作家，常常因为害怕批评而不敢动笔了。这固然应怪作家自己勇气不足，但是批评的不健全也是有责任的。
    自然，轻视和敌视批评的态度，也是不对的，其结果也同样会促使批评衰落。作家自己对于创作情况应该也是采取一种积极的互相促进的态度，而不应该把批评工作看作只是批评家的事情。
    批评工作不仅是帮助作家，尤其要教育读者。判断力还不强的青年读者常常把批评的文章作为他们读作品的指导。我们的批评所产生的社会影响是很大的，对于这些青年群众的教育、指导，批评家是负有重大责任的。
    克服文学批评工作的这些缺点，发展社会主义现实主义的批评，和促进创作是不可分的、同样重要的任务。因此要求我们的批评家应该站在思想斗争的最前线，善于掌握马克思列宁主义的理论，掌握社会主义现实主义的批评方法，从更高的思想水平来实事求是地分析作品，帮助作家教育读者。应该把批评看作一种严肃的科学工作，群众工作，而不是感想式的工作。因此必须严格按照毛主席在延安文艺座谈会所指示的文艺批评的标准，坚持文学批评的原则性，来进行文艺问题上的两条战线的斗争。应该要求批评家和作家亲密地合作，用互相帮助、互相尊重、互相学习的态度来建立与人为善的同志式的批评，应该要求批评家经常的倾听群众的意见，注意社会的情况。一个批评家应当比作家具备更多方面的社会知识，更有系统的对社会生活的了解，更深刻的对社会现象的判别能力，然后才能给予作家以更有效的帮助。
      马克思列宁主义的科学文艺理论，本国文学史和世界文学史的基本知识，苏联文艺创作经验等，也是文学批评家必须具备的资本。一些搬弄条文的教条主义的批评，所以能够存在，正是表示我们缺乏马克思列宁主义文艺理论的武装。加强这方面的学习，应当是批评家的日常生活的重要一部分。
    最后，让我们检查一下“文协”的工作。
      “文协”的领导工作，四年以来，是没有做好。上面所说的文学工作的这一系列的缺点，基本上应该说和“文协”的领导上的缺点是分不开的。
  “文协”的许多工作机构在很长的一个时期中，没有真正建立起来。对于创作思想和文学批评的领导，“文协”做的很少，领导思想、方针都不够明确。对于有些工作，例如群众业余文艺活动的辅导，例如学习我国文学遗产，“文协”没有给以应有的重视。在党的指示、督促之下，我们领导了文艺整风运动和对于社会主义现实主义的学习，也获得了一定的成绩，然而，在运动和学习中发生的一些问题，未能及时地适当地做出结论。也是在党的指示下，我们曾两次组织作家深入生活，并组织作家的创作，也取得了若干经验。但是，作家下去以后，我们的关心是不够的。我们没有能够随时就他们在体验生活过程中所发生的问题，给以必要的帮助和解决；最近，在这方面，我们的工作已有所改进。“文协”的几个刊物的工作也是不够满意的。对于在普及工作上占重要地位的通俗刊物，我们几乎没有任何指导。
    “文协”领导机关对于作家的关系也不够密切。在北京的作家人数很多，可是我们没有采取有效的办法帮助作家交换意见，交流经验。一九五一年组织过一些以在京作家为基础的若干小组（诗歌、小说等等小组），由于组织方式的未尽完善，更由于每次的讨论会没有很好的准备，结果是多半流于形式，以后就无形消灭。我们需要使参加各组的作家个个有话要说，使各组的讨论既不致漫无边际，也要避免枯燥的搬弄理论，而能每次都有中心，真正解决一些问题。这一切基本的缺点如不坚决克服，我们决不能完成新的历史时期所交给我们的新任务。
    为了调整并加强各文艺团体，全国委员会提出了改组“全国文协”为中国作家协会的建议。我认为这一建议是正确的，适合时宜的。大会主席团草拟了作家协会新章程的草案，即将付大会讨论。在这草案的“总纲”内，具体地规定了作家协会的任务。我们认为作家协会应该是以其自己的创作活动和批评活动积极地参加中国人民的革命斗争和国家建设事业的作家与批评家的自愿组织。它的任务，主要是下列各项：
    一、组织作家创造具有社会主义思想和高度的真实性的文学作品，加强对创作活动与批评工作的领导。我们必须很好地接受四年来的经验教训，继续有计划有组织地发动作家深入生活，学习马克思列宁主义，学习政府和党的政策，学习社会主义现实主义的文学理论和苏联的文学创作经验；我们必须通过创作组的方法，展开作家之间关于创作研究的互相竞赛，互相帮助，鼓励各种文学形式、体裁与风格的多样性的发展。
    我们必须使得我们的批评工作走上健全发展的道路。在加强批评工作的领导时，应当注意克服主观主义的、片面性的批评，应当从研究和分析具体作品来帮助作家，从创作实践和批评中发展社会主义现实主义的原则。
    二、应当从思想与方法上加强指导文学普及工作。必须以最大努力培养青年作家，加强对于青年和初学写作者的指导，传播成熟的经验。特别要注意从工农干部中培养出新作家，并注意推进各兄弟民族的文学运动。
    三、用马克思列宁主义的观点和方法，批判地接受中国的和世界的古典文学遗产。整理和研究古代及近代的中国文学，发扬中国民族文化的优秀传统。促进国际的文化合作，加强国际间的文化交流，积极参加保卫世界和平和进步文化的伟大斗争。
    这就是作家协会的任务，也就是我们大家共同奋斗的目标。
    新的作家协会，必须是充满朝气的，紧张工作的作家的团体；必须是认真地负责地领导文学创作与批评活动的团体。
    新的作家协会有责任领导我们为完成上述任务而作最大的努力，而作家协会全体会员同志也应当把完成上述任务看作自己的责任。
    代表同志们：伟大的毛泽东时代给了我们各尽所长、自由发展、为人民服务、为祖国效力的最好的条件。我们生活在伟大的社会主义改造的历史时期。在我们面前，是社会主义社会的美丽的远景。在共产党的领导之下，在共产主义思想教育之下，我们有信心完成光荣的任务。我国的文艺潜力是无限量的，我们的队伍在一天一天地壮大，我们每天每天在增加着健康的新鲜的血液。让我们为中国的社会主义现实主义文学的成长壮大而奋斗，让我们为新中国文学的辉煌灿烂的前途而努力罢！
