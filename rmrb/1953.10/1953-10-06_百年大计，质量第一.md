　　Century Plan, Quality First
　　“Mortar is like the blood in your body,
　　It must never be allowed to flow out!”
　　The workers of the Li Shengkun group at the construction site of the Anshan Iron and Steel's large rolling mill are most concerned about quality. One day, while pouring the extended foundation, they suddenly discovered a hole in the formwork. Seeing that the mortar was about to flow out, worker Hao Jinming unhesitatingly took off his clothes and blocked the hole. He pointed to the mortar and said, "Mortar is like the blood in your body, it must never be allowed to flow out!" The construction site's Party organization immediately used various forms of propaganda to promote this exemplary deed to all employees. The workers were very moved. Zhao Huawu said: I used to only know how to work and eat, and didn't care about the quality, this is not the attitude of a master at all, and I must improve the quality in the future.
　　When pouring the concrete for the No. 36 foundation, one end was high and the other was low. The construction site propagandist immediately composed a quick-rhythm verse: "Be careful when pouring, the earth must be evenly distributed; one end is high and one end is low, one end is dry and one end is thin, the dry end loses the mortar, and the thin end is all cement; if it is not corrected quickly, the quality will definitely be a problem." After the workers read it, they immediately corrected the problems in their work.

　　Specialized division of labor and nameplates hung
　　Everyone works conscientiously
　　The United Hospital construction site of the Second Engineering Department of the Anhui Provincial Construction Company first established a section-based responsibility system in establishing a responsibility system, clearly dividing and fixing the work of each production team and group, and at the same time putting forward specific requirements for quality and output. After the implementation of the section-based responsibility system, the quality fully met the standards, and the output also increased. Some workers said: "In the past, leading cadres only called on everyone to improve quality and increase output, but no one asked us whether we did well or badly; now that we have a section-based responsibility system, everyone is working very seriously." In order to improve the section-based responsibility system, the leading cadres of the construction site also implemented a "quality nameplate system." In this way, the responsibilities from the workshop, the team to the individual are clarified, and the workers pay more attention to the quality. In the past, some young workers only sought speed and not quality when building walls, but now they are humbly learning from experienced workers, improving their skills and ensuring quality.

　　Compare the good and bad examples
　　Conservative technicians were enlightened
　　The construction site of Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Institute held a "Typical Project Quality Visit Conference" during the quality inspection. The employees visited two typical groups at the meeting, one was the Geng Youcai group and the other was the Wang Yongyi group. The Geng Youcai group promoted advanced experience such as "double-hand mortar squeezing method" (for mixed water walls) and "mortar squeezing and scraping method" (for one-sided clear water walls) on the basis of implementing the group technical responsibility system. They also used advanced tools - mortar spreaders in their work, and strictly implemented the inspection system, so the mortar was full, and the wall body and wall surface were built in accordance with the requirements of the drawings with good quality. The Wang Yongyi group did not promote advanced experience, so the project quality was not good, the wall surface was uneven, the mortar was not full, and large seams were exposed at the joints. The old technician Wang Dianrong said after the visit: "In the past, I always thought that our project was complicated, with many doors and windows, and the technical level of the workers was low, and it was impossible to promote advanced experience at all. Now I am enlightened. The technical level of the workers led by Geng Youcai is not considered high, but they have successfully promoted advanced experience. Our group blames me for being too conservative!" After visiting the conference, a wave of learning advanced experience was set off on the construction site, and the original forty-odd mortar spreaders were no longer enough. The Wang Yongyi group, which had relatively poor quality in the past, also gloriously won the red flag of "Quality Excellence."

　　Clear division of labor and frequent inspections
　　More than 300,000 bricks are laid without any difference
　　Since the start of construction, the Zhao Shangwu bricklaying group of the No. 14 bricklaying team of the Benxi Industrial Engineering Company has laid a total of 383,230 bricks, all of which meet the quality standards.
　　After the Zhao Shangwu group started work, they first divided into three work groups according to the technical level of the workers. The work groups then clearly divided the work, with senior technicians responsible for laying the outer skin of the wall, junior technicians responsible for laying the inner skin of the wall, and apprentices responsible for carrying bricks and grouting. The group formulated methods for implementing operating procedures and quality standards and a system of mutual inspection at any time during construction. Before construction every day, they check whether the line poles set by the construction workers according to the drawings are correct, and check the quality of the day's project for ten minutes before leaving work.
　　Due to the establishment of these systems, the workers' sense of responsibility has been improved. Before laying bricks, the apprentices water the bricks, and the mortar is mixed very evenly. When laying each brick, the technicians check whether there are any missing corners and mottled bricks, and check whether the brick is level while laying. In addition to everyone paying attention to doing their own work well, they also often help and supervise each other. For example, when the junior technician Jin Changchun was laying the inner skin bricks, one layer protruded from the eaves. After the group leader Zhao Shangwu found out, he immediately told him to correct it.

　　Improve technology and evaluate merits and demerits
　　The quality of stone masonry is improved month by month
　　The quality of the stone masonry of the Qi Ruxiang-led stone masonry group of the Fourth Civil Construction Team of Yangquan Mining Bureau has been improved month by month. The first-class products reached 91.8% in June, 94.4% in July, and 95.2% in August.
　　Why can the Qi Ruxiang group ensure the quality is improved month by month?
　　Since May of this year, their group began to pay attention to training apprentices. During rest time, technicians teach apprentices the operating methods of stringing lines, selecting materials, cutting materials, chiseling materials, and stacking walls. Now there are six apprentices who can build partition walls and inner wall skins. The technicians also often exchange experience, which prepares technical conditions for ensuring quality. At the same time, they established a strict inspection system and a merit and demerit book. After work every day, they hold a meeting to check the quality of the day's project, carry out democratic evaluation, and implement a reward and punishment method of "three points deducted for one aligned seam, one point deducted for one uneven place, and three points awarded for the best work." In addition, they also strictly implemented the group's rotating duty inspection system, responsible for inspecting the project quality. For example, a dormitory was found to have crooked lines, but the workers who laid the clay did not find it. After the rotating duty officer checked and found it, they immediately reported it to the construction site captain and urged the group to operate in accordance with the regulations to ensure the project quality.

　　After the No. 1 blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant launched a production increase and economy drive, it holds a 15-minute furnace-front meeting every day to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of production, conduct commendations and criticisms, and clarify the responsibility system. This short meeting is of great benefit to improving product quality and encouraging workers' enthusiasm for production. Xinhua News Agency reporter Yue Guofang

    百年大计，质量第一
    “灰浆好比身上的血，
      决不能让它往外淌！”
    鞍钢大型轧钢厂工地李胜坤小组的工人最关心质量。有一天打灌扩大基础时，忽然发现模板有漏洞，眼瞅着灰浆就要流出来了，工人郝金明毫不迟疑地脱下衣服堵住漏洞，他指着灰浆说：“灰浆好比身上的血，决不能让它往外淌！”工地党组织立刻采用各种宣传形式，向全体职工宣传了这个模范事例。工人们听了都很感动，赵华武说：我过去只知道干活吃饭，不管质量好坏，这根本不是主人翁的态度，今后一定要把质量搞好。
    在打灌三十六号基础混凝土时，打的一头高一头低。工地宣传员马上编了一首快板：“打灌当中要留心，下土一定要平均；一头高来一头低，一头干来一头稀，干的这头跑了浆，稀的那头尽水泥；若不赶快来纠正，质量一定成问题。”工人们看了以后，立刻纠正了工作中的毛病。
      分工专责又挂牌
        每人干活都认真
    安徽省建筑公司第二工程处所属联合医院工地，在建立责任制中首先建立了分段负责制，把每一个生产分队、小组的工作划分清楚，并固定起来，同时对质量、产量提出具体要求。实行分段负责制后，质量完全符合标准，产量也提高了。有的工人说：“过去领导干部光号召大家提高质量，提高产量，可是我们作好作坏没有人问；现在有了分段负责制，每个人干活都顶认真了。”该工地领导干部为了把分段负责制提高一步，又实行了“质量挂牌制”。这样一来，从车间、小组到个人责任都明确了，工人对质量更加重视起来。过去有些青年工人在砌墙时只求快不求好，现在都虚心向老师傅学习，提高了技术，保证了质量。
      好坏典型比一比
        保守的技工开了窍
    北京钢铁工业学院工地在质量大检查时举办了一次“典型工程质量参观大会”。职工们在会上参观了两个典型小组，一个是耿有才小组，一个是王永义小组。耿有才小组在贯彻小组技术责任制的基础上推广了“双手挤浆法”（用于混水墙）和“挤浆兼刮浆法”（用于一面清水墙）等先进经验，他们在工作中又使用了先进工具——铺灰器，并严格贯彻了检查制度，所以铺灰饱满，墙身和墙面砌得都合乎图纸的要求，质量很好。王永义小组因为没有推广先进经验，所以工程质量不好，墙面不平，灰浆不满，接槎的地方露着大缝子。老技工王殿荣参观后说：“从前我总认为我们的工程复杂，门窗口多，工人技术水平又低，根本不能推广先进经验。这回可开窍了。耿有才领导的工人的技术水平也不算高，可是人家推广先进经验成功了。我们小组就怪我太保守啦！”参观了大会之后，工地里掀起了学习先进经验的热潮，原有的四十几个铺灰器已经不够用了。过去质量比较差的王永义小组，也光荣地得了“质量优胜”的红旗。
    分工明确勤检查
        砌砖三十多万都不差
    本溪工业工程公司第一工程处瓦工十四队赵尚武瓦工小组，自开工以来一共砌了三十八万三千二百三十块砖，全部合乎质量标准。
    赵尚武小组在开工以后，首先根据工人的技术水平，分成了三个作业小组，作业小组又明确分工，大技工负责砌墙外皮，小技工负责砌墙里皮，徒工负责搬砖和灌浆。小组里制订了贯彻操作规程和质量标准的办法和在施工中随时互相检查的制度。他们每天在施工前按图纸检查施工员放的线杆子是否正确，下班前十分钟检查当天工程的质量。
    由于建立了这些制度，工人们的责任心提高了，每回在砌砖前徒工都把砖浇上水，灰浆拌的非常均匀，技工在砌每一块砖时都要检查一下有没有掉角的和花脸砖，并且一边砌一边看砌的平不平。除了每个人注意作好自己的工作外，并且经常互相帮助、互相监督，如小技工金长春在砌里皮砖时有一层出了檐子，组长赵尚武发现后，马上告诉他改正过来了。
      提高技术评定功过
        砌石质量月月提高
    阳泉矿务局第四土建队祁如祥领导的砌基石小组砌基石质量逐月提高，头等品六月份达到百分之九十一点八，七月份达到百分之九十四点四，八月份达到了百分之九十五点二。
    为什么祁如祥小组能保证质量逐月提高呢？
    从今年五月份，他们小组开始注意培养徒工，利用休息时间，技工给徒工讲挂线、选料、裁料、凿料、叠墙等操作方法，现在已有六个徒工能砌隔墙和里墙皮。技工们也经常交流经验，这样就给保证质量准备了技术条件。同时他们建立了严密的检查制度和功过簿，每天收工后开会检查当日工程质量，展开民主评比，并实行“一道对缝扣三分，一处不平扣一分，作的最好奖三分”的奖惩办法，另外他们还严格执行了小组轮流值日检查制，负责检查工程质量。如某幢宿舍放线歪了，打灰土的工人没有发现，经过轮流值日员检查后发现了，立即向工地队长报告，督促这个小组按照规程进行操作，保证了工程质量。

    鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂一号高炉，在展开增产节约竞赛后，每日上下班时都进行一次十五分钟的炉前会议，讨论生产中的优缺点，进行表扬与批评，明确责任制。这种短时间的会议，对提高产品质量，鼓励工人生产积极性有很大好处。　新华社记者　岳国芳摄
