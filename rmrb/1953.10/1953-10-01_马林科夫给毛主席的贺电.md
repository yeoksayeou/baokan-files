Malenkov's Congratulatory Telegram to Chairman Mao

To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China:

On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please accept my heartfelt congratulations, Comrade Chairman, and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The past four years have demonstrated to the world the great vitality and strength of the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China is successfully implementing historical reforms domestically and ensuring the improvement of the economic, cultural, and material life of the people. The People's Republic of China has become an international force, a force that does not allow imperialists to arbitrarily enslave the people of Asian countries and wantonly carry out policies aimed at turning Asia into a breeding ground for a new world war. The Korean War has proven that the Chinese people have become a powerful fortress in the struggle of the oppressed people of the East for freedom and independence.

The progress of the People's Republic of China in all aspects fills all progressive mankind with deep satisfaction and pride. No force in the world can stop the Chinese people from advancing along the road of national prosperity and national prosperity. The Soviet people warmly congratulate the great Chinese people on their new achievements in realizing the national industrialization plan, developing agriculture, improving people's welfare, and further consolidating their people's democratic state with all their strength.

For the well-being of our two peoples, and to consolidate world peace and international security, may the unbreakable brotherly friendship and close cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China grow and develop!

G. Malenkov
Moscow, September 30, 1953

    马林科夫给毛主席的贺电
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东同志：
    值此中华人民共和国成立四周年纪念日，主席同志，请您及中华人民共和国中央人民政府接受我衷心的祝贺。过去的四年向全世界表明了中华人民共和国的伟大的生活力和强固性，中华人民共和国正在顺利地实行国内历史性的改革并且保证人民群众经济、文化和物质生活的提高。中华人民共和国已经成为一种国际力量，这个力量不容许帝国主义者任意地奴役亚洲各国人民及为所欲为地执行旨在把亚洲变成新的世界大战温床的政策。朝鲜事件证明中国人民业已变成东方被压迫人民争取自由与独立的斗争中的强大堡垒。
    中华人民共和国在各方面的进步使全体进步人类感到深为满意并引为骄傲，世界上没有任何一种力量能够阻止中国人民沿着全国高涨和祖国繁荣的道路前进。苏联人民热烈地祝贺伟大的中国人民在实现国家工业化计划、在发展农业和提高人民福利、在进一步全力巩固自己的人民民主国家的事业中获得新的成就。
    为我们两国人民的福利、为巩固世界和平与国际安全，愿苏联和中华人民共和国之间牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊与紧密合作日益增长与发展！
    格·马林科夫
    一九五三年九月三十日于莫斯科
