Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 14th - The US side notified the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in the evening of the 13th that they would complete the construction of the explanation facilities, including thirty-two explanation tents, at Dongchang-ri at midnight on the 13th. This notice fully proves that the US side's claim on the 12th that the construction of the explanation facilities would not be completed until the 21st was a complete lie to delay the start of the explanation work. Obviously, it was due to the protests from the Korean and Chinese side, the urging of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and the condemnation of world opinion that the US side found itself in complete political isolation and had to build it.

The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has requested both sides to begin the explanation work on October 15th. On the morning of the 14th, the Korean and Chinese side has submitted the explanation work plan for the 15th to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. According to the regulations of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese side will begin at 8:00 a.m. on the 15th at the explanation site in the Indian troops' guard camp in Dongchang-ri. The explanation work will be conducted for eight hours every day.

According to the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, the representatives of the prisoners of war's countries of origin have the right to conduct ninety days of explanation to the prisoners of war, and the prisoners of war should have the right to listen to ninety days of explanation. However, due to the US side's unreasonable delaying actions, the date of commencement of the explanation work has been delayed by more than ten days. And the US side still stubbornly refuses to accept the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's request to extend the explanation period. Major General Li Xiangchao, the chief member of our side of the Military Armistice Commission, has lodged a strong protest to the other side at the Military Armistice Commission meeting on October 7th, and pointed out that the responsibility for delaying the explanation work lies entirely with the US side, so the US side has no reason to oppose the extension of the explanation time. The duties and responsibilities of the neutral nations stipulated in the "Terms of Reference" must not be changed due to the deliberate obstruction of the US side.

### 美方宣称在十三日午夜修好解释设备  中立国遣返委员会要求双方开始解释工作

    美方宣称在十三日午夜修好解释设备
    中立国遣返委员会要求双方开始解释工作
    【新华社开城十四日电】美方在十三日傍晚通知中立国遣返委员会：他们将在十三日午夜在东场里修建完成包括三十二个解释帐篷的解释设备。这个通知充分证明美方十二日所声称的要在二十一日才能完成解释设备的修建工作，完全是拖延解释工作开始的谎言。显然，这是由于朝中方面的抗议，中立国遣返委员会的催促和世界舆论的指责，美方发现它自己在政治上完全处于孤立地位，才不得不把它修建起来的。
    中立国遣返委员会已要求双方在十月十五日开始进行解释工作。十四日早晨，朝中方面已将十五日的解释工作计划交给中立国遣返委员会。根据中立国遣返委员会的规定，朝中方面的解释工作将从十五日上午八时起，在东场里印度部队看管营地的解释地点开始。解释工作将每日进行八小时。
    根据停战协定规定，战俘所属国家的代表有权对战俘进行九十天解释，战俘应有权听取九十天解释。但是由于美方蛮横无理的拖延行动，使得解释工作开始的日期延迟了十多天。而美方迄今仍蛮横无理地拒绝接受中立国遣返委员会提出的顺延解释期限的要求。军事停战委员会我方首席委员李相朝将军对此已在十月七日军事停战委员会议上向对方提出强硬抗议，并且指出：延迟解释工作的责任完全在于美方，所以美方没有任何理由反对延长解释时间。“职权范围”中规定的中立国的职务与责任决不能由于美方的故意阻挠而加以改变。
