To the worker comrades of the state-owned cotton textile factories in Zhengzhou and Xianyang:

The great economic construction of the motherland is developing rapidly. The living standards of the people are gradually improving. You, the worker comrades of the textile factories, are actively producing more novel, high-quality, and inexpensive fabrics to meet the needs of the people's lives. The workers of our factory are deeply aware that we are brother factories, and our responsibility is to continuously improve product quality and supply you with easy-to-use machinery and equipment.

Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the concerted efforts of all the factory's workers, our factory is now not only able to produce textile machinery, but also to continuously improve product quality and successfully trial-produce new products. But we will never be satisfied with this. In order to victoriously and overfulfill the national plan, all the workers of our factory have carefully examined the shortcomings in past work, further clarified the main direction of future efforts, and formulated specific plans for increasing production and practicing economy in conjunction with the production conditions of our factory in 1954. We guarantee to supply the products of the textile factories under construction on schedule; guarantee to increase the production of twelve sections of drawing frames before the end of this year in addition to completing the national plan, successfully trial-manufacture two twisting machines, promptly dispose of stagnant materials, reduce enterprise management fees, and guarantee to save 2.9 billion yuan by the end of this year.

In our machinery manufacturing plant, improving technology, improving product quality, and reducing the scrap rate are of great significance to increasing production. We are now working hard to improve the operating procedures of the rollers in order to solve the long-standing shortcomings of non-interchangeable joints; strive to reduce the eccentricity of the joints from five threads to two and a half threads, and gradually reach the first-class product standards set by the ministry. In the past, the hardness of steel rings after quenching was small and the deformation was large; recently, after the workers tried to improve it, the hardness of the steel rings reached the standard set by the ministry, and the rework rate of flatness has also been reduced from 80% to 25%, and will continue to be reduced. We are trying to use sandblasting instead of manual grinding to increase the smoothness and productivity of the steel rings. We have also initially proposed some improvement methods to ensure that the spindles after fitting together do not feel numb at a speed of 12,000 revolutions per minute. And on this basis, we will further study how to increase the number of revolutions of the spindle. The scrap rate of our factory's foundry workshop has recently been reduced from 4.5% to 4%, and we are striving to reduce it to 3%.

In order to ensure the implementation of the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, our factory has decided to accurately estimate the completion of the monthly plan every month, calculate spare parts and scrap rates, assess effective production capacity, and use it to arrange the work plan for the next month, and grasp the balance between production volume and production capacity; organize all departments to carry out work around the work plan, especially to do a good job in production technical preparation and scheduling; establish a planning meeting system and a daily plan inspection system at each level, and strive for each group to complete the plan evenly on a weekly basis.

Driven by Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, labor models and advanced workers, all employees of our factory are actively involved in the competition. We are now reporting these plans and practices to you, hoping that you will test the quality of our products in your work, help us improve our work, and warmly congratulate you on your continuous new victories on the front of increasing production and practicing economy!

    写给郑州和咸阳各国营棉纺织厂职工的信郑州、咸阳各国营棉纺织厂的职工同志们：
    祖国伟大的经济建设在突飞猛进地发展着。人民的生活水平在逐步提高着。你们，纺织厂的工人同志们，为了满足人民生活的需要，正积极生产更多的花样新颖、品质优美、价钱便宜的布匹。我厂职工都深深知道：咱们是兄弟厂子，我们的责任就是不断提高产品质量，供应你们以得心应手的机器设备。
    在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在全厂职工的一致努力下，我厂现在不但能够出产纺织机器，而且产品质量不断地提高，新产品不断地试制成功。但我们决不因此满足。为了胜利地、超额地完成国家计划，我厂全体职工认真地检查了过去工作中的缺点，进一步认清了今后主要的努力方向，结合一九五四年我厂的生产条件，订出了增产节约的具体计划。我们保证如期供应正在建设中的纺织厂的产品；保证在完成国家计划之外，在今年年底以前增产十二节并条机，试造成功两部捻线机，及时地处理呆滞料，减少企业管理费，保证到今年年底节约二十九亿元。
    在我们机械制造厂，提高技术、改进产品质量和降低废品率，对提高生产有重要的意义。我们现在正努力改进罗拉的操作规程，以解决过去长期存在着的接头不能互换的缺点；争取接头偏心由五丝减少到二丝半，逐渐达到部订的一级品标准。过去钢领淬火后硬度小，变形大；最近经过职工设法改进，钢领的硬度达到部订标准，扁圆度的退修率也已由百分之八十降低到百分之二十五，而且还将争取继续减低。我们正试用喷砂来代替人工打磨，以增加钢领的光滑度和生产率。我们还初步地提出了一些改进办法，争取使合套后的锭子在每分钟一万二千转的速度下不麻手。并在这一基础上再进一步研究提高锭子的转数。我厂铸工车间的废品率最近已由百分之四点五降低到百分之四，正在争取降低到百分之三。
    为了保证增产节约计划的实现，我厂决定每月精确地估计当月计划完成的情况，计算备品和报废率，核算有效的生产能力，根据它来编排下月的作业计划，掌握好生产量和生产能力的平衡；组织各科室围绕着作业计划来进行工作，特别要做好生产技术准备工作和调度工作；建立计划会议制度和逐级的每日检查计划制度，争取每个小组按周均衡地完成计划。
    我厂在共产党员、青年团员、劳动模范和先进工作者的带动下，全体职工都积极投入竞赛。我们现在把这些计划和做法向你们报告，希望你们在工作中检验我们的产品质量，帮助我们改进工作，并热切地祝贺你们在增产节约战线上不断取得新的胜利！
