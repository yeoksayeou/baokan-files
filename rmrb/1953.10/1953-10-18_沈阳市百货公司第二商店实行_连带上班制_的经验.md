    The Shenyang Department Store No. 2 has a total of 364 employees, of which 185 are salespersons, accounting for 50.9% of the total. They are divided into 14 sales groups, managing 4,100 kinds of goods. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party and the superior company and with the active efforts of all employees, the No. 2 store has achieved many successes in business management. However, the problem of short business hours and excessively long working hours for salespersons has not been resolved.
    Every summer, the No. 2 store increases personnel and extends business hours to nine hours, but still cannot meet consumer demand. The store opens at 10:00 AM, but before 9:00 AM, the store is already crowded with customers. It closes at 7:00 PM, which is the busiest time for employees after work. Salespersons work 10.5 hours a day (including settlement and stocking), which is very tiring. Among the 185 salespersons, 18 are resting due to lung disease, and 20% of the female comrades suffer from gynecological diseases. Salespersons reflect: "Standing from early morning until dark, never seeing the sun." Excessive working hours affect better service to customers. In April of this year, customers raised 32 complaints, 25 of which were criticisms of the poor service attitude of salespersons. In order to change these situations, with the assistance of the Commercial Department of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, the Northeast Commercial Administration Bureau, and the Shenyang Department Store Company, the experience of the Soviet "linked shift system" was studied. Based on sales conditions, the labor organization and some systems were changed, business hours were extended by two hours, and salesperson working hours were shortened by two and a half hours. Preliminary trials have yielded results.

    I

    Before implementing the "linked shift system," in-depth investigations were first conducted to study sales patterns. The No. 2 store studied sales patterns through two methods.

    One is the experience synthesis analysis method: First, investigate the surrounding environment and location of the No. 2 store, as well as the sales targets. Research items include: the store's supply range, the type and quantity of surrounding stores, and their supply capacity. Then, analyze the store's position and study the social composition and purchasing power of consumers. Second, analyze historical sales based on sales figures, using classification (according to the category of major commodities, sales time, and target) statistics to separately record changes in the demand for different commodities by different consumers at different times, and identify historical consumption patterns. Again, based on shortage registrations, counter diaries, customer opinion book records, and especially paying attention to absorbing the salespersons' accumulated practical sales experience for analysis, to understand the current specifications, quality, colors, and styles of goods needed by consumers. After the above experience synthesis analysis, a preliminary understanding of the basic supply situation of the No. 2 store was obtained as follows:

    The No. 2 store is located in an area with a large number of residents, and the sales targets are mainly residents and employees. Large-scale purchases by government agencies, factories, and mines are rare. From the perspective of sales figures, there are more purchases made by residents (including some suburban farmers) in the morning, and mainly by employees in the evening. According to historical sales statistics, government agencies, factories, and mines account for 11.8% of the total sales, and employees and residents account for 88.2% (residents account for approximately 45%, employees account for approximately 40%, and others account for 15%). The business situation of the No. 2 store is: it is busier on the 10th and 25th of each month due to employee paydays; the busiest day is Sunday; Wednesday is also busier because some factories have their day off; other days are normal.

    The other is the actual measurement method: investigate the number of daily transactions and sales figures to study the daily sales patterns. First, formulate a statistical table for the number of transactions and the amount of money, and record in groups three times a day (once every three hours) in the morning, noon, and evening, using three different sales methods (card sales method, invoice payment method, cash-and-carry method) for actual measurement. The results showed the daily sales pattern of the store: the average total number of transactions per day is 12,109, with 4,689 in the morning, 3,456 at noon, and 3,964 in the evening. This shows that the sales pattern of the No. 2 store is busy in the morning and evening, and relatively idle at noon. However, the sales patterns of each group are also different. For example, the sports and musical instrument group is busy in the morning and noon and idle in the evening because the supply targets are government agencies, factories, mines, and organizations; while the food group is idle in the morning and busy at noon and in the evening. After finding out the sales patterns, it became possible to reallocate labor.

    II

    Based on the results of the investigation and research, it was believed that it was possible to implement the "linked shift system" in the No. 2 store. However, several key issues must be resolved before it could be implemented. First, the "linked shift system" allocates manpower according to the daily customer visit patterns and belongs to a multi-shift system. The No. 2 store is a one-shift system, and implementing the "linked shift system" with the current staff will inevitably lead to a shortage of manpower. Second, the No. 2 store has an individual responsibility system, that is, individuals manage goods and individuals keep accounts. The implementation of the "linked shift system" involves different people working at different times, making it impossible for individuals to be responsible. Third, the implementation of the "linked shift system" must first solve the problem of exchanging personnel during shifts and arranging rotations.

    The solutions to the above three problems are: combine commodity groups, adjust work locations, rationally divide the business area occupied by each group according to the seasonality and correlation of commodities, and implement comprehensive warehouse delivery to solve the manpower shortage. Secondly, clearly define the work tasks and responsibilities of the personnel in the sales group, establish mutual assistance groups, and implement a "joint guarantee, specialized division of labor" group responsible goods management system. According to this principle, a implementation plan was drafted, and specific implementation methods were studied.

    III

    The specific measures for implementing the "linked shift system" are as follows:

    1. Business hours and shift rotation methods: According to the store's business patterns, it was decided that the store would be open seven days a week, each person would work eight hours a day, and each person would take one day off a week on a rotating basis. The store would be open to the public for 11 hours a day (which can be extended or shortened according to the season and actual needs). In order to ensure that each mutual assistance group always has someone who understands the previous shift situation to reduce errors and avoid cumbersome handover procedures, three types of shifts are adopted, which are rotated weekly: (1) Early and late shifts, with a break at noon; (2) Early and noon shifts, with a break in the evening; (3) Noon and late shifts, with a break in the morning. Each shift is four hours, including settlement time in the last shift. Each group flexibly stipulates the number of people per shift according to the different daily business conditions, with more people during busy times and fewer people during idle times. For example, the first mutual assistance group of the fabric group has six salespersons, divided into three shifts: the first shift is from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM, with four people; the second shift is from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, with three people; and the third shift is from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM, with three people. According to this allocation, the early and noon shifts, the noon and late shifts, and the early and late shifts are connected, and each person works exactly eight hours a day, and one person can be taken off to rest; the whole group works on Sunday (because they have already rotated). Such a flexible arrangement of labor allows each salesperson's working hours to match the number of buyers.

    2. Establishment of mutual assistance groups: Due to the different nature of the commodities, business conditions, and working conditions of each sales group, the number of mutual assistance groups and the number of people in each group are also different. The principle is that the mutual assistance group should not exceed six people and not be less than three people, and each group should make appropriate regulations according to the specific situation. Because it is not easy to manage if there are too many people, and the rotation will not work if there are too few people after deducting those on public holidays. Each mutual assistance group will democratically elect one leader and one deputy leader. The mutual assistance group leader should meet the following conditions: (1) Have certain business capabilities, understand the situation of all group members and commodity knowledge, and have a high sense of responsibility; (2) Be good at uniting and mobilizing the masses and have prestige; (3) Have a spirit of hard work and impartiality. The main tasks of the mutual assistance group leader are: (1) Responsible for the allocation of group personnel; (2) Master and check commodity inventory; (3) Ensure that accounts match goods.

    3. Establishment of responsibility system and inspection system: In order to transform the individual responsibility system into a mutual assistance group responsibility system in an organized and led manner, the leadership of the group leader must be strengthened and the material responsibility and inspection responsibility of the group must be stipulated. That is, the sales group leader shall bear the material responsibility of the entire sales group, closely grasp and guide the business activities of each mutual assistance group, and conduct regular inspections. The mutual assistance group leader is responsible for the stocking, receiving, safekeeping, sales accounting, adjustment and repricing, and arrangement of shift order of each mutual assistance group, and check whether the commodities sold by the group members are consistent with the accounts. Salespersons shall bear the specialized inspection responsibility for a certain type of commodity within the group and the supervision and mutual assistance responsibilities for accounting, sales, and safekeeping. If an accident occurs due to personal negligence, the individual shall be responsible. If the cause is unclear, the group shall be jointly responsible. In addition, a shift handover system and a "record book" shall be established, and the implementation of the system by each person shall be used as one of the conditions for the monthly evaluation and award.

    4. Merge commodity groups, adjust work locations, and rationally divide the business area of sales groups: In order to give full play to the role of unit area, achieve rational use of manpower, and change the waste phenomenon of "having to watch the piles even if they are not selling," some sales groups were merged according to the seasonality of commodities and the connection of uses, and the work locations were adjusted. The counter area occupied by best-selling products was appropriately expanded to solve the difficulty of manpower shortage.

    5. Provisions for group accounting: With the implementation of the "linked shift system", it is no longer possible for individuals to keep accounts, and it must be changed to the last shift of the mutual assistance group to keep accounts. There are two methods: (1) Parallel flow accounting method. That is, carry out a reasonable division of labor according to work expertise. For example, those who are accurate and fast at using abacus are responsible for auditing, those who write clearly and proficiently are responsible for creating forms, and other personnel are responsible for sorting out cards and small receipts. This way of working together can save time; (2) Collective accounting method. All members of the last shift share the records according to the number of commodity cards. However, in order to take care of the settlement, in the initial stage, comrades with higher business ability should be appropriately arranged to the last shift every day to avoid delaying time and making mistakes.

    6. Handover method for cashiers: Because cashiers control cash, a personal responsibility system must be implemented to clarify responsibilities. However, in order to avoid wasting time by carrying out complicated handover procedures during business hours and affecting sales, a "special person for special funds, two sets of cards" method is adopted. That is, personnel from the previous and next shifts prepare a set of cards (in different colors) and change. At the time of handover, the previous shift clears its own cash and cards, verifies the cash figures and hands them over to the next shift, accumulates them once, and unifies the settlement by the last shift.

    7. Handling of holidays and temporary illness: (1) Holidays are special circumstances, and the existing personnel cannot solve them. The company should uniformly adjust and allocate personnel to provide support; (2) In case of temporary illness, the store should make internal adjustments to form a mobile personnel force to supplement them at any time.

    8. Implementation of warehouse delivery system: In order to reduce the auxiliary work of salespersons during business hours, increase direct business hours, enable them to concentrate on answering customers, and improve service quality, a warehouse delivery system is implemented. That is, the sales group submits a plan for the goods needed for the next day every day, and the warehouse delivers the goods within the specified time according to the group plan. However, the means of transportation for delivery (handcarts, etc.) shall be the responsibility of the store's administration to solve.

    9. Inventory stocktaking, commodity labeling and pricing: Because most stores have an individual goods management system, the implementation of the "linked shift system" is the mutual assistance group's goods management. This requires clarifying the accounts and goods in the individual goods management stage through inventory stocktaking, and then labeling each commodity (internal and counter) with large characters, writing the product name and price (if there is a quota, the quantity should be indicated) so that all group members are familiar with the commodities and avoid price differences and wrong goods.

    IV

    The preliminary gains after the implementation of the "linked shift system" are as follows: First, business hours have been extended, meeting consumer demand and winning praise from customers. For example, comrades from the bedding factory said: "In the past, you also got off work when I got off work, and I really had opinions; now it really takes care of the employees." Second, the working hours of salespersons have been shortened, ensuring rest. In the past, because the salespersons were tired from work, the trade union did not want to participate in the evening parties it mobilized. Now, the recreation room has become the most active place for employees. Female salesperson Lu Huayun said: "Before the time was changed, my legs were swollen every day because I stood for a long time, which was very painful, so I didn't have a good attitude towards customers. After changing the time, my legs never swelled once, so I was very happy!" Therefore, labor efficiency has been improved, and sales have increased. According to the statistics of the second store's implementation of the "linked shift system" for only six days (of which four days were rainy days), sales increased by an average of 29.46% per day, and labor efficiency increased by an average of 29.7%. At the same time, salespersons' commodity knowledge range has been expanded, and their business level has also been improved. In addition, unity and mutual assistance have been strengthened, and labor discipline has been consciously observed.

    沈阳市百货公司第二商店实行“连带上班制”的经验
    沈阳市百货公司第二商店共有三百六十四人，其中营业员一百八十五人，占总人数百分之五十点九。共分十四个营业小组，经营四千一百种商品。几年来在党和上级公司的领导和全体职工的积极努力下，第二商店在经营管理方面虽然获得很多成绩，但对营业时间短、营业员劳动时间过长这个问题，始终没有得到解决。
    每年夏季，第二商店都增加人员、延长营业时间至九小时，仍然不能满足消费者的要求。早晨十时开业，但在九时以前商店门前就拥满了顾客；晚间七时停业，又正是职工下班营业最忙的时间。而营业员每日劳动时间达十小时半（包括结账、上货），非常疲劳。在一百八十五名营业员中，因患肺病休息的有十八名，女同志百分之二十患妇女病，营业员反映：“清早站到黑夜，两头不见太阳”。劳动时间过长，影响了更好地为顾客服务。今年四月份顾客提出三十二件意见，其中有二十五件是属于对营业员服务态度不好的批评。为了改变这些情况，在中共沈阳市委商业部、东北商业管理局、沈阳市百货公司协助下，学习了苏联“连带上班制”的经验，根据售货情况改变了劳动组织和一些制度，延长营业两小时，缩短营业员劳动时间两小时半，经初步试行，已获得成绩。
    一
    实行“连带上班制”前，首先深入调查，研究了营业规律。第二商店通过两种方法，研究了营业规律。
    一种是经验综合分析法：首先调查第二商店周围环境和所处地位，以及销货对象。研究项目包括：商店供应范围，周围商店的类型、数量、供应能力，再分析本商店所处地位，研究消费者的社会构成及其购买力水平。其次，从卖钱额上分析历史销货情况，采用分类（按主要商品的类别、销货时间和对象）统计的办法，把不同消费者在不同时期对不同商品要求的变化分别统计，找出历史消费规律。再次，根据缺货登记，柜台日记、顾客意见簿的记录，并特别注意吸取营业员日积月累的实际销货经验，加以分析，以了解当前消费者需要商品的规格、质量、花色、式样等。经过上述经验综合分析，初步掌握了第二商店供应的基本情况如下：
    第二商店处在市民较多的地区，销货对象主要为市民和职工，机关、厂矿大宗的购买较少。从卖钱额上看，每日早晨市民（包括部分郊区农民）买货较多，晚间以职工为主。根据历史卖钱额统计，机关、厂矿占总卖钱额的百分之十一点八，职工和市民占百分之八十八点二（市民约占百分之四十五，职工约占百分之四十，其他占百分之十五）。第二商店营业情况：每月十日、二十五日因职工发薪较忙；每周星期日最忙；星期三因部分工厂公休也较忙；其他日子平常。
    另外一种是实际测定法：调查每日交易次数和卖钱额，研究每天的营业规律。首先制定交易次数、金额的统计表，每日分早、午、晚三次分组记录（每三小时记录一次），采用三种不同售货方法（卡片售货法、开票付货法、一手钱一手货法）进行实际测定。结果就找出了商店每日的营业规律：平均每天总交易次数为一万二千一百零九次，早晨四千六百八十九次，午间三千四百五十六次，晚间三千九百六十四次。说明第二商店的营业规律是早、晚忙，午间较闲。但各组的营业规律也有所不同，如：运动乐器组，因供应对象为机关、厂矿和团体，所以早、午忙，晚间闲；而食品组，则早晨闲，午、晚忙。找出了营业规律，各组重新安排劳动力，就有了根据。
    二
    根据调查研究的结果，认为第二商店实行“连带上班制”有可能。但必须解决这样几个关键问题才能实行。一、“连带上班制”是按每日顾客的来店规律配备人力，属于多班制。第二商店是一班制，按现在人员实行“连带上班制”，必将发生人力不足的现象。二、第二商店是个人责任制，即个人管货，个人记账。实行“连带上班制”，是按不同时间分别先后上班，不可能再由个人负责。三、实行“连带上班制”，必须先解决插班的交换和轮串的编排问题。
    以上三个问题，解决的办法是：根据商品的季节性和连系性，合并商品组、调整工作地、合理划分各组占用的营业面积，并实行全面仓库送货，以解决人力不足。其次，明确划分营业小组人员的工作任务和职责，成立互助组，实行“共同保证，专职分工”的小组专责管货制。按照这一原则，拟出施行方案，并研究具体贯彻的办法。
    三
    实行“连带上班制”的具体措施如下：
    1、营业时间和串班办法：根据商店的营业规律，决定每周营业七日，每人每日工作八小时，每周每人采取轮休制公休一天，每日对外营业十一小时（根据季节和实际需要可延长和缩短）。为使各互助小组经常有人了解前班情况，以减少差错，避免繁杂的交接手续，采取三种班次，每周互相轮流：（一）早、晚接班，中午休息；（二）早、午连班，晚上休息；（三）午、晚连班，早晨休息。每班均为四小时，末班包括结账时间在内。各组根据每日不同的营业情况，灵活规定每班人数，忙时人多，闲时人少。如布匹组第一互助组六个营业员，分成三班：第一班从上午九时到下午一时，四个人；下午一时至五时三个人；五时到九时三个人。根据这样的分配，早、午班，午、晚班和早、晚班上下一串，每人每天正好工作八小时，还可抽出一个人休息；星期日全组上班（因已轮休完）。这样机动地安排劳动力，结果，使每个营业员的工作时间和购买者人数多少相适应。
    2、成立互助小组：各营业组由于商品性质、营业情况和工作条件不同，互助小组数和每组的人数也不同。互助小组以不超过六人不少于三人为原则，由各组按具体情况作适当规定。因为人多不易掌握，人少除去公休人员又串不过来。各互助组由民主选举产生正、副组长各一名。互助小组长应具备以下条件：（一）具有一定业务能力，了解全组人员情况和商品知识，并有高度责任感；（二）善于团结和发动群众，并有威信；（三）有刻苦耐劳精神，行事公正。互助组长的主要任务：（一）负责小组人员的调配；（二）掌握和检查商品库存；（三）保证账货相符。
    3、建立责任制度与检查制度：为了使个人责任制有组织有领导地变为互助小组负责制。必须加强小组长的领导与规定小组的物质责任和检查责任。即营业小组长要负整个营业小组的物质责任，紧密的掌握和指导各互助组的业务活动，经常进行检查。互助小组长要负责各互助小组的上货、接货、保管、售货记账、调整改价和插班顺序的编排，并抽查组员的销售商品是否与账相符等。营业员要负小组内一定种类商品的专职检查责任与记账、售货、保管的监督、互助责任。如因个人失职发生事故，即由个人负责，原因追查不清，即由小组共同负责。另外要建立插班的交接制度和“记事簿”，并将每人执行制度情况，做为月终评奖条件之一。
    4、合并商品组，调整工作地，合理的划分营业小组的营业面积：为了充分发挥单位面积的作用，达到合理使用人力，改变“虽不卖钱也得看堆”的浪费现象，在照顾购买者方便的原则下，根据商品的季节性与用途的联系性，将某些营业小组合并，工作地加以调整，畅销品占用的柜台面积适当扩大，以解决人力不足的困难。
    5、小组记账的规定：实行“连带上班制”，不可能再由个人记账，必须改为互助小组末班记账，共有两种方法：（一）平行流水记账法。即按工作特长，进行合理分工。如算盘打的准而快的担任核数工作，写的清楚熟练的作表，其他人员整理卡片和小票。这样分头并进，可以节省时间；（二）集体记账法。由末班全体人员，按商品卡片数分摊记录。但为了照顾结账，初期要将业务能力较高的同志，适当地编排到每日的末班，以免拖延时间和出错。
    6、收款员的交接办法：因收款员掌握现金，必须实行个人负责制，以明确责任，但为了避免在营业时间进行繁复的交接手续浪费时间，影响卖货，采取“专人专款，两套卡片”的办法。即前后班人员均准备一套卡片（颜色不同）和零钱。交班时，前班自己清理现款和卡片，将现金数字核清交给后班，一次累计，统一由末班结算。
    7、关于节、假日和临时发生病号的处理：（一）节、假日属于特殊情况，现有人员不能解决，应由公司统一调剂，拨人增援；（二）临时发生病号，由商店内部调剂，组成机动人员随时补充。
    8、实行仓库送货制：为了减少营业员在营业时间的辅助工作，增加直接营业时间，使之集中精力答对顾客，提高服务质量，实行仓库送货制。即由营业小组，每日提出第二日要货计划，仓库即根据小组计划，在规定时间内送货。但送货的运输工具（手推车等），由商店的行政负责解决。
    9、清点库存，进行商品的标签标价：因为大部分商店均为个人管货制，实行“连带上班制”是互助小组管货，这就必须通过清点库存的办法，把个人管货阶段的账货弄清楚，然后，将每种商品（库内的、柜台的）用大字标签，写上品名、价格（如有定额要标明数量），以便全组人员熟悉商品，避免差价、错货现象。
    四
    实行“连带上班制”后的初步收获如下：一、延长了营业时间，满足了消费者要求，博得顾客的好评。如被服厂的同志说：“过去我下班你们也下班，我真有意见；现在才真正照顾到职工。”二、缩短营业员的劳动时间，保证了休息。过去因营业员工作累，工会动员开晚会都不愿参加。现在，游艺室已变成了职工最活跃的场所。女营业员卢化云说：“没改时间前因站的时间长，每天腿都肿，非常痛苦，所以对顾客也没有好态度。改变时间后，腿一次也没肿，所以精神很愉快！”因此，劳动效率提高了，卖钱额增加了。仅根据第二商店实行“连带上班制”六天的统计（其中有四天是下雨天）卖钱额每日平均增加了百分之二十九点四六，劳动效率平均提高了百分之二十九点七。同时，营业员的商品知识范围扩大了，业务水平也提高了。并且，加强了团结互助，自觉地遵守劳动纪律。
