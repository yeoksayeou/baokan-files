Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th. At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 19th, the Korean and Chinese side lodged its third serious protest against the US side's violation of the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and sabotage of the explanation work. General Li Sang-cho, chief member of the Korean and Chinese side, resolutely demanded that the US side immediately cease the illegal acts of using Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee secret agents, stationed in prisoner-of-war camps and appearing in explanation tents under the guise of US representatives and interpreters, to threaten and obstruct prisoners of war from applying for repatriation. He pointed out that the Military Armistice Commission has the responsibility to supervise the implementation of the Armistice Agreement, including the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," and emphasized that the US side must not evade all responsibility for sabotaging the explanation work as stipulated in the "Terms of Reference."

At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 7th, the Korean and Chinese side lodged its first serious protest against the US side's violation of the "Terms of Reference" and deliberate delay in the construction of explanation facilities to sabotage the explanation work. Public opinion condemnation and the firm demands of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission forced US chief member, Brigadier General Bryan, to claim at the meeting that the explanation facilities were "under construction," but in fact the construction of the explanation facilities only began on the afternoon of the 8th.

At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 14th, the Korean and Chinese side lodged its second serious protest against the US side directing Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee secret agents stationed in prisoner-of-war camps to sabotage the explanation work. However, on the one hand, the US side vehemently denied its serious acts of sabotaging the agreement, and on the other hand, it continued to send signals, using hospitals, administrative personnel, and radio stations, to direct the secret agents to intensify their activities of sabotaging the explanation work. After the explanation work began on the 15th, the Chiang Kai-shek secret agents stationed in the prisoner-of-war camps by the US side and appearing in the explanation tents under the guise of US representatives and translators, cooperated with the US observation representatives and, according to the predetermined steps already revealed by our returning captured personnel, openly threatened and obstructed prisoners of war from applying for repatriation, disrupting the explanation work. This has been fully proven by the facts of the past few days.

At today's meeting, US chief member, Brigadier General Bryan, attempted to shift the responsibility for the US side's sabotage of the explanation work onto the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, claiming that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission had "full responsibility for conducting the explanation work," and hypocritically stated that the US side "supported" the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. However, in fact, it is the US side that is sabotaging the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. In the past few days of explanation work, the chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission subsidiary organ in the explanation tents has repeatedly ordered the US observation representatives to cease disruptive behavior, but they have always ignored the orders of the chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission subsidiary organ. According to a United Press report from Munsan on the 19th, the US observation representatives have received instructions at a secret meeting to create new excuses to intensify their sabotage activities. Brigadier General Bryan's statement today shows that the US side still intends to continue sabotaging the activities of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in performing its duties in accordance with the "Terms of Reference."

### 在军事停战委员会十九日会议上  我方再次抗议美方破坏解释工作

    在军事停战委员会十九日会议上
    我方再次抗议美方破坏解释工作
    【新华社开城十九日电】军事停战委员会十九日会议上，朝中方面第三次严重抗议美方违反“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，破坏解释工作。朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军坚决要求美方立即停止利用安置在战俘营中和以美方代表及译员为名出现在解释帐篷的蒋李特务威胁和阻挠战俘申请遣返的非法行为。他指出军事停战委员会有责任监督停战协定包括“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的执行，并强调指出，美方决不能逃避破坏“职权范围”所规定的解释工作的全部责任。
    在军事停战委员会七日会议上，朝中方面曾对美方违反“职权范围”、蓄意拖延解释设备的修建以破坏解释工作的行为，第一次提出严重抗议。舆论的谴责和中立国遣返委员会的坚决要求，迫使美方首席委员勃里安在会上声称解释设备正“进行修建中”，但事实上解释设备的修建拖延到八日下午方才开始。
    在军事停战委员会十四日会议上，朝中方面对于美方指挥它安置在战俘营中的蒋李特务破坏解释工作的行为，第二次提出严重抗议。然而，美方一方面矢口抵赖它的这些严重破坏协议的行为，另一方面仍然继续发出信号，利用医院、行政人员和电台等，指挥特务加紧进行破坏解释工作的活动。在十五日解释工作开始后，美方安置在战俘中的和以美方代表及翻译为名出现在解释帐篷中的蒋介石特务，就与美方观察代表合作，按照早已被归来的我方被俘人员揭露的预定步骤，公开威胁和阻挠战俘申请遣返，破坏解释工作的进行。这已为过去几天的事实所充分证明。
    在今天的会议上，美方首席委员勃里安企图把美方破坏解释工作的责任推到中立国遣返委员会身上，他声称中立国遣返委员会已“负全责主持解释工作的进行”，并伪善地表示美方“支持”中立国遣返委员会。然而事实上正是美方在破坏中立国遣返委员会的工作。在过去几天的解释工作中，解释帐篷中的中立国遣返委员会附属机构的主席，曾一再命令美方观察代表停止扰乱行为，但他们却总是不理会中立国遣返委员会附属机构的主席的命令。据合众社汶山十九日电透露，美方观察代表已在一次秘密会议上收到训令，要制造新的藉口来加紧他们的破坏活动。勃里安今天的声明，表明美方仍企图继续破坏中立国遣返委员会按照“职权范围”执行其职责的活动。
