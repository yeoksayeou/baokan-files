    The Chinese People's Festival
    --Soviet "Labor Daily" October 1st Editorial

    Today, the great Chinese people and all progressive humanity celebrate the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    On this day, the Soviet people warmly congratulate their Chinese brothers and sisters who began building a new and happy life four years ago. These thoughts and feelings of the Soviet people are expressed in the congratulatory telegram from Comrade G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, to Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and in the congratulatory telegram from V.M. Molotov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, to Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China.

    Comrade Malenkov said in his telegram: "On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please accept my heartfelt congratulations to you and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Chairman. The past four years have shown the world the great vitality and strength of the People's Republic of China, which is successfully implementing historical reforms at home and ensuring the improvement of the economic, cultural, and material life of the people. The People's Republic of China has become an international force that does not allow the imperialists to arbitrarily enslave the people of Asian countries and carry out policies aimed at turning Asia into a hotbed of a new world war. The Korean War proves that the Chinese people have become a powerful fortress for the oppressed people of the East in their struggle for freedom and independence. The all-round progress of the People's Republic of China fills all progressive humanity with satisfaction and pride. No force in the world can stop the Chinese people from advancing along the road of national prosperity and the prosperity of the motherland. The Soviet people warmly congratulate the great Chinese people on their new achievements in realizing the national industrialization plan, developing agriculture and improving people's welfare, and further consolidating their people's democratic state with all their strength. For the benefit of our two peoples, and to consolidate world and international security, may unbreakable fraternal friendship and close cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China continue to grow and develop!"

    From the example of the People's Republic of China, people are once again convinced of how great achievements the people who have taken power into their own hands can achieve in a short period of time. In the short period since its establishment, the People's Republic of China has achieved remarkable achievements in the development of economy and culture, and has created all the necessary prerequisites for the planned development of the national economy. The land reform has been completed, which means that the most reactionary force in old China—the landlord class—has been eliminated as a class. Hundreds of millions of peasants have received land and have been freed from cruel feudal exploitation. In the past four years, agricultural production has not only been fully restored, but has also exceeded the highest level in Chinese history.

    The Chinese people have also achieved equally great achievements in industry. The current level of industrial production greatly exceeds that of pre-war. Many new industrial sectors, such as the production of complex lathes, mining equipment, motors, automobiles, and tractors, have also been successfully developed. The state-owned economic sector, which is the economic foundation of the people's democratic system, is developing and consolidating. In 1952, the output of state-owned industrial enterprises accounted for nearly 60 percent of the national industrial output.

    This year, under the glorious leadership of the Communist Party, People's China has embarked on its first five-year plan. The basic task of this plan is to concentrate major forces on developing heavy industry, to lay the foundation for national industrialization, and to ensure the further growth of the socialist sector in the national economy. There is every reason to assume that, with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, People's China will surely be able to successfully solve this solemn and great task.

    The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution has great international significance. The peace-loving policy of the People's Republic of China enables all progressive social forces in the East to turn Asia into a fortress of peace. Today, the People's Republic of China is a powerful stabilizing factor in Asia and the Pacific region. The enemies of peace have tried every possible means to keep China as an object of their political gambling and exploitation, but contrary to their will, the People's Republic of China has achieved true national sovereignty. In the past, China could only play a supporting role on the international stage and become a plaything of the imperialist powers, but that era is gone forever. The current People's China implements its own independent and autonomous policy, which is primarily oriented towards the interests of the Chinese people themselves, and also conforms to the interests of peace-loving humanity around the world.

    Therefore, on the occasion of celebrating the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China today, people of all countries congratulate this new great power and all peace-loving forces in defending the interests of lasting peace and international security. People of all countries see in the emergence of the People's Republic of China the most important historical result in the development of international life in recent decades.

    The existence of the People's Republic of China has aroused the mad jealousy of the enemies of peace. They have adopted a hostile and adventurous policy towards China, attempting to isolate the People's Republic of China, undermine the peaceful negotiation of the Korean issue, and expand the war to Chinese territory.

    This aggressive policy once again proves how stubborn its initiators are. Who does not understand now that, in the current international situation, any attempt to "isolate" the People's Republic of China can only be a reactionary dream of those who have lost their sense of reality. Every sane person understands that at present, without the participation of great China, no important issue regarding the establishment of international peace can be resolved. As for those sinister plans of aggression against the Chinese people, these plans only show that the enemies of peace obviously do not want to learn from the lessons of history. But history teaches that there is no force in the world that can frustrate a people who have taken the destiny of the country into their own hands. Such a people cannot be intimidated, enslaved, or conquered. The great strength of free people lies in the inevitable failure of any conspiracy of aggressors against them.

    The immortal friendship between the peace-loving Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China has become a powerful fortress of peace. This friendship powerfully strengthens the entire great camp of peace and democracy. Not long ago, progressive people warmly congratulated another conclusive proof of the unbreakable friendly relations between the Chinese and Soviet peoples - the signing of the agreement between the Soviet Union and China on assistance to China in developing the national economy. This agreement demonstrated the two peoples' and the two governments' unremitting will to continuously consolidate their fraternal friendship and strengthen the defense of world peace.

    No force on earth can sever the close ties between the great Chinese people and the great Soviet people. This selfless friendship is equally precious to everyone who hates war and cherishes peace, because, in all fairness, this friendship is one of the most important conditions for consolidating international peace.

    Today, on the National Day of the great Chinese people, the Soviet people extend their heartfelt congratulations to the Chinese people. For the benefit of our two peoples, and for the benefit of ensuring lasting world peace, the Soviet people wish that the all-round cooperation and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China will be further consolidated and developed.

    中国人民的节日
    ——苏联“劳动报”十月一日社论
    今天，伟大的中国人民和全体进步人类庆祝中华人民共和国成立四周年。
    在这个日子里，苏联人民热烈庆贺在四年前开始建设新的幸福生活的自己的中国兄弟和姊妹们。苏联人民的这种思想和感情，在苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫同志致中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东同志的贺电中表达出来，也在苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫同志致中华人民共和国政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来同志的贺电中表达出来。
    马林科夫同志在电报中说：“值此中华人民共和国成立四周年纪念日，主席同志，请您及中华人民共和国中央人民政府接受我衷心的祝贺。过去的四年向全世界表明了中华人民共和国的伟大的生活力和强固性，中华人民共和国正在顺利地实行国内历史性的改革并且保证人民群众经济、文化和物质生活的提高。中华人民共和国已经成为一种国际力量，这个力量不容许帝国主义者任意地奴役亚洲各国人民及为所欲为地执行旨在把亚洲变成新的世界大战温床的政策。朝鲜事件证明中国人民业已变成东方被压迫人民争取自由与独立的斗争中的强大堡垒。中华人民共和国在各方面的进步使全体进步人类感到深为满意并引为骄傲，世界上没有任何一种力量能够阻止中国人民沿着全国高涨和祖国繁荣的道路前进。苏联人民热烈地祝贺伟大的中国人民在实现国家工业化计划、在发展农业和提高人民福利、在进一步全力巩固自己的人民民主国家的事业中获得新的成就。为我们两国人民的福利、为巩固世界和平与国际安全，愿苏联和中华人民共和国之间牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊与紧密合作日益增长与发展！”
    人们从中华人民共和国的榜样中，再度确信：把政权掌握在自己手里的人民，在短短的时间内会获得多么巨大的成就。在成立到现在的较短时间内，中华人民共和国已在经济和文化各方面的发展中获得了卓越的成绩，已为有计划地发展国民经济创造了一切必要的前提。土地改革已经完成，这就意味着旧中国最反动的力量——地主阶级已作为阶级被消灭了。几万万的农民得到了土地，免除了残酷的封建剥削。四年以来，农业生产不仅全部恢复，并且超过了中国历史上的最高水平。
    在工业方面，中国人民也取得了同样伟大的成绩。现在的工业生产水平大大地超过了战前。许多新的工业部门，诸如复杂车床、采矿设备、电机、汽车和拖拉机的生产，也顺利地发展起来了。作为人民民主制度经济基础的国营经济部分在发展着、巩固着。一九五二年国营工业企业的产量约近全国工业产量的百分之六十。
    今年，人民中国在光荣的共产党领导之下，已着手实施自己的第一个五年计划。这个计划的基本任务就是集中主要力量发展重工业，以建立国家工业化的基础，并保证国民经济中的社会主义部分的进一步增长。完全有理由可以设想：在苏联的兄弟般的帮助下，人民中国一定能胜利地解决这个庄严伟大的任务。
    中国人民革命的胜利有着重大的国际意义。中华人民共和国爱好和平的政策，使得东方一切进步的社会力量能够把亚洲变为和平的堡垒。今天，中华人民共和国在亚洲和太平洋区域是一种强大的稳定因素。和平的敌人曾经千方百计地希图保持中国作为他们政治赌博和剥削的对象，但和他们的意志完全相反，中华人民共和国却取得了真正的国家主权。过去，中国在国际舞台上只能充当配角而成为帝国主义列强的玩物，但是，这个时代已经一去不复返了。现在的人民中国实行着自己独立自主的政策，这种政策首先是以中国人民自己的利益为方向，同时也符合全世界爱好和平人类的利益。
    因此，在今天庆祝中华人民共和国成立四周年的时候，各国人民都祝贺这个新的伟大的强国和所有爱好和平的力量一道，保卫持久和平与国际安全的利益。各国人民从中华人民共和国的出现这一事件上，看到了最近几十年来国际生活的发展上最重要的有历史意义的结果。
    中华人民共和国的存在引起和平敌人的疯狂嫉恨。他们对中国采取了敌视的冒险的政策，企图孤立中华人民共和国，破坏朝鲜问题的和平协商，和把战争扩大到中国领土去。
    这种侵略政策又一次地证明了它的首倡集团如何顽固。谁现在还不明白，在现在的国际局势下，任何想“孤立”中华人民共和国的打算都只能是丧失了现实感的人们的反动梦想而已。每个思想健全的人都了解，在现时没有伟大的中国参加，任何一个关于建立国际和平的重要问题都是无法解决的。至于提到那一些反对中国人民的侵略的罪恶计划，那么这些计划只不过说明：和平的敌人显然不想从历史的教训中学习。但是历史却教训说，在世界上没有任何力量能够挫折已经把国家的命运掌握在自己手中的人民。这样的人民是不可能被吓倒、不可能被奴役、不可能被征服的。自由人民的伟大力量，任何反对他们的侵略者的阴谋必然破灭的道理就在这里。
    爱好和平的苏联和中华人民共和国的不朽的友谊成为和平的强大堡垒。这种友谊非常有力地加强着整个和平民主的伟大阵营。不久以前，进步人们曾热烈祝贺中国人民和苏联人民牢不可破的友好关系又一次确凿的证据——苏中两国签订了关于援助中国发展国民经济的协定。这个协定表明了两国人民和两国政府不断巩固彼此的兄弟友谊、加强保卫世界和平的不屈不挠的意志。
    地球上没有任何力量可能断绝伟大的中国人民和伟大的苏联人民间的亲密联系。对于每个厌恨战争和珍贵和平的人说来，这种无私的友谊是同样珍贵的，因为公正地说，这种友谊是巩固国际和平的头等重要的条件之一。
    今天，在伟大中国人民的国庆日里，苏联人民向中国人民致以衷心的祝贺，为我们两国人民的利益，为保障世界持久和平的利益，苏联人民愿苏联和中华人民共和国之间的全面合作和牢不可破的友谊，得到进一步的巩固和发展。　（新华社）（附图片）
