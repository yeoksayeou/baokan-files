Xinhua News Agency, October 26th dispatch: Czechoslovak News Agency reports: The Secretariat of the World Peace Council published a statement by Sahib Singh Sokhey, Major General, Member of the Council of States of the Indian Parliament, and Vice President of the All-India Peace Council. The statement said: It is now clear that some people are deliberately trying to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement that has been reached. They are using the most despicable methods to try to prevent the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission from visiting the prisoners of war, thus preventing them from resolving the issue of prisoner repatriation that has dragged on the war for a full year.

    The governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea hope that the composition of the political conference can promote the resolution of the issue and avoid a repeat of the Panmunjom talks.

    It is clear that some countries do not want a peaceful end to the Korean War. For these countries, negotiations are nothing more than a disguised tactic to undermine a peaceful resolution.

    However, these countries must not be allowed to do as they please. They must be prevented from launching a new war in Korea.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: TASS, Delhi, October 24th: Dr. Kitchlew, President of the All-India Peace Council, issued a statement on October 24th, the eighth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. The statement said: Eight years ago, on October 24, 1945, people all over the world watched the establishment of the United Nations with great hope. But their hopes have not been realized. They have seen that the United Nations has not fulfilled its task of safeguarding world peace.

    The establishment of the "Little General Assembly" is an attempt to undermine the foundation of the United Nations - the principle of unanimity among the five major powers; the US government's deliberate obstruction of the People's Republic of China from entering the United Nations, especially the Korean War waged under the banner of the United Nations, has made the people of the world clearly recognize that the United Nations is increasingly being used as a tool of war and a tool for policies aimed at condoning and supporting the oppression of colonies and organizing war alliances.

    Never has there been such an urgent need to be vigilant against attempts to undermine the foundations of the United Nations by amending the UN Charter, which can only lead to the complete destruction of the United Nations itself. Unless the People's Republic of China obtains its legitimate status in the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations, the United Nations can never act with strength and authority like a truly global organization. Without the participation of the People's Republic of China, no peace problem in Asia and the world can be satisfactorily resolved.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 27th dispatch: London News: On October 24th, the Manchester branch of the Britain-China Friendship Association held a mass rally at the Manchester Free Trade Hall, demanding that People's China be admitted to the United Nations. The resolution passed by the conference said: "This gathering of Manchester citizens believes that admitting People's China into the United Nations is a necessary step towards a peaceful resolution of all Far Eastern problems, and will also contribute to the development of harmonious, friendly, and trade relations between Britain and China. Therefore, all Manchester parliamentarians need to ask the government to use its full influence to promote the immediate admission of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations."

    Dean Johnson of Canterbury said at the meeting: "China will be one of the greatest countries in the world, and it is extremely wrong for us to restrict trade with it."

    The meeting passed a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong, which read: "This gathering of Manchester citizens extends its warmest congratulations on the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Long live Britain-China friendship!"

    全印和平理事会副主席索克就朝鲜形势发表声明
    斥美方破坏停战协定阻挠战俘遣返的行为
    克其鲁主张我国应在联合国取得合法地位
    【新华社二十六日讯】捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道：世界和平理事会书记处发表了印度国会联邦院议员、全印和平理事会副主席萨希布·辛格·索克少将的声明。声明称：现在可以清楚地看到，有人蓄意要破坏已经达成的朝鲜停战协定。他们用最可耻的方法，尽力阻挠中立国遣返委员会访问战俘，不让他们由此解决使战争因此拖延了整整一年的战俘遣返问题。
    中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府希望政治会议的组成，能促进问题的解决，并避免板门店谈判的重演。
    很明显，某些国家不希望朝鲜战争和平结束。对这些国家说来，谈判不过是破坏和平解决的伪装手法而已。
    然而，不能让这些国家为所欲为。一定要阻止它们在朝鲜发动新的战争。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社德里二十四日电：全印和平理事会主席克其鲁博士于二十四日，即联合国成立八周年那天发表声明。声明说：八年前，在一九四五年十月二十四日，全世界人民怀着巨大的希望注视联合国的成立。但是他们的希望没有实现，他们看到联合国并没有完成它保卫世界和平的任务。
    “小型联大”的成立就是企图破坏联合国的基础——五大国的一致原则；美国政府的处心积虑阻挡中华人民共和国进入联合国，尤其是在联合国旗帜下进行的朝鲜战争，已使全世界人民明白认清，联合国已越来越被人利用来作为战争的工具，和旨在纵容并支持对殖民地的压迫以及组织战争联盟的政策的工具。
    从来也没有像现在这样迫切需要警惕地反对以修改联合国宪章来破坏联合国的基础的企图，这种企图只能使联合国本身趋于完全的毁灭。如果中华人民共和国一直不能取得它在安全理事会和联合国大会中的合法地位，联合国就永远不能像一个真正的世界性组织那样有力量和权力地行动。没有中华人民共和国的参加，亚洲和全世界的和平问题没有一个能够得到圆满的解决。
    【新华社柏林二十七日电】伦敦消息：十月二十四日，英中友好协会曼彻斯特分会在曼彻斯特自由贸易大厦召开群众集会，要求接纳人民中国进入联合国。大会通过的决议说：“曼彻斯特公民的这一集会相信，接纳人民中国进入联合国，是和平解决所有远东问题的必要步骤，同时并将有助于英中和睦、友好与贸易关系的发展。因此需要所有曼彻斯特议员要求政府，使用它的全部影响来促使立刻接纳中华人民共和国进入联合国。”
    坎特伯雷约翰逊教长在会上发言说：“中国将是世界上最伟大的国家之一，我们限制与它贸易是极端错误的。”
    会上通过了向毛泽东主席致敬电，电文说：“曼彻斯特公民的这一集会，对中华人民共和国建国四周年纪念表示最热烈的祝贺。英中友好万岁！”
