    Sichuan Emei Mountain Officially Begins Mining Phosphate Ore

    Sichuan's Emei Mountain has officially begun mining phosphate ore, and more than 4,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer powder processed from the phosphate ore has already been produced. To help farmers adopt phosphate fertilizer, the Preparatory Committee of the Sichuan Provincial Cooperative Federation and the Sichuan Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and other units, established a short-term phosphate powder technology training station in August this year, training more than 60 people. Rural areas in various counties of the Leshan Special District of Sichuan Province have begun to focus on trial use of phosphate fertilizer.

    Sichuan's Emei Mountain has relatively abundant phosphate ore reserves. After being discovered by a survey team organized by the Leshan Special Commissioner's Office in 1950, small-scale trial production of phosphate fertilizer began in 1951. After focused trial use, the results were good. Later, the state-owned Leshan Phosphate Fertilizer Factory was established, and it officially began producing phosphate fertilizer in the second quarter of this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    四川峨嵋山正式开采磷矿
    四川峨嵋山已正式开采磷矿，由磷矿加工而制成的磷肥粉已有四千多吨。为了帮助农民采用磷肥，四川省合作社联合社筹备委员会、四川省人民政府农林厅等单位在今年八月开办了短期磷粉技术传授站，训练了六十多人。四川省乐山专区各县农村已开始重点试用磷肥。
    四川省峨嵋山蕴藏有较多的磷矿。一九五零年经乐山专署组成的勘测队发现后，一九五一年就开始小规模地试制磷肥，经过重点试用，效果良好。后来国营乐山磷肥厂成立，到今年第二季度就正式生产磷肥。（新华社）
