    Commemorating the 25th Anniversary of the Publication of "Why Can China's Red Political Power Exist?"
    Fu Zhong
    "The fundamental issue of all revolutions is the issue of state power." [1] From its inception, the Chinese Communist Party has fought primarily to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism and its running dogs in China and to establish a new democratic China. In this struggle, Comrade Mao Zedong's theory on establishing revolutionary political power played a tremendous guiding role. Comrade Mao Zedong's article "Why Can China's Red Political Power Exist?" published on October 5, 1928, is one of his brilliant treatises on the issue of political power. In this article, Comrade Mao Zedong creatively combined the universal principles of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, answering a theoretical question of decisive significance in the Chinese revolution after the failure of the First Revolutionary Civil War—the question of whether the Red Army and red political power could exist and develop—and determining that armed struggle should be the primary form of revolutionary struggle and that the revolutionary strategy should be to encircle the cities from the countryside and then seize the cities. The practical course of the Chinese revolution fully proves the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's theory. (I)
    After the failure of the First Revolutionary Civil War, the Chinese Communist Party was in an extremely complex environment and an extremely serious period. The question facing the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people at this time was how to preserve the living forces of the revolution, re-establish revolutionary positions, prepare for a new great revolution, and ensure its victory. The Party's task was first to correctly analyze the situation at that time and point out the correct path for revolutionary struggle.
    In "Why Can China's Red Political Power Exist?" Comrade Mao Zedong first made an extremely brilliant analysis of the political situation at the time. He pointed out: "The rule of the new warlords of the Kuomintang is still the rule of the urban comprador class and the rural landlord class, surrendering to imperialism externally, and replacing the old warlords with new warlords internally. Their economic exploitation and political oppression of the working and peasant classes is even more severe than before. ... The workers, peasants, and common people, and even the bourgeoisie, throughout the country are still under the rule of counter-revolution and have not obtained the slightest political or economic liberation." He then pointed out the nature and tasks of the Chinese revolution: "China urgently needs a bourgeois democratic revolution, and this revolution must be led by the proletariat to be completed." "The content of China's democratic revolution ... includes overthrowing the rule of imperialism and its tool warlords in China, completing the national revolution, and implementing land revolution to eliminate the feudal exploitation of peasants by the landlord class." [2]
    Contrary to Comrade Mao Zedong's correct analysis, after the failure of the revolution, the Chen Duxiu elements declared that China's bourgeois democratic revolution had ended due to the victory of the bourgeoisie, that the bourgeoisie had established and would consolidate its rule, and that the Chinese proletariat should abandon revolutionary struggle, turn to legal movements, and wait for a socialist revolution to be held in the future. From this, the Chen Duxiu elements became liquidationists and embarked on the counter-revolutionary road of combining with the Trotskyists.
    So, what was the revolutionary situation at that time? Was it a high tide or a low tide? This was the starting point for the Party to decide its struggle strategy. Comrade Mao Zedong determined that the revolution was in a low tide and provided powerful evidence from his own personal experience: "We have fought in various places over the past year and deeply feel the ebb of the national revolutionary tide." [3] However, Comrade Mao Zedong also foresaw that a revolutionary high tide would definitely come, and it would come relatively quickly. This prediction was a conclusion drawn from analyzing the situation at that time and discerning the development of various contradictions that caused the revolutionary high tide.
    Since the revolution was in a low tide, the Party's strategy should undoubtedly be retreat rather than attack. That is to say, the Party should quickly gather revolutionary forces, organize an orderly retreat and defense in the face of the enemy's offensive. In October 1927, Comrade Mao Zedong led the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army to the Jinggang Mountains, correctly solving this strategic problem. However, the march to the Jinggang Mountains was not a simple retreat, but also an attack on the counter-revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong skillfully combined the retreat and offensive of the revolution, demonstrating his creative application of Marxist-Leninist tactics. The revolutionary forces retreated from the cities, but launched an offensive in the countryside; although the revolution temporarily lost the cities, it armed and separated the countryside, making the countryside a central base for retreat, and at the same time a new direction for launching offensives. The direct goal of this offensive was to oppose the running dogs of imperialism—the Kuomintang who betrayed the revolution—and to oppose the feudal landlord class; the path of attack was land revolution, armed struggle, and the establishment of revolutionary base areas.
    Contrary to Comrade Mao Zedong's correct understanding, the first "Left" leaning line emerged within the Party at this time. This "Left" leaning line, due to its failure to correctly understand the nature of Chinese society and the tasks of the revolution, confused the definite boundaries between the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and subjectively and eagerly exceeded the democratic revolution; when assessing the situation, it still believed that the revolutionary high tide was present, estimating the enemy as "extremely wavering" and "panic-stricken," thus refusing to retreat and adopting a blind adventurist strategy, which resulted in the failure of the offensive.
    Comrade Mao Zedong's article first enabled all comrades in the Party to have a clear understanding of the situation at that time, clarified the ideological confusion within and outside the Party at that time, and pointed out a clear direction for struggle. (II)
    After the failure of the 1927 revolution, based on his analysis of the social conditions and revolutionary situation in China, Comrade Mao Zedong determined that after the Chinese revolution was defeated by powerful enemies in the cities, it would be temporarily impossible to achieve victory in the cities. Therefore, it was necessary to formulate a revolutionary line, that is, to gather strength in the countryside, use the countryside to encircle the cities, and then seize the cities. Because Comrade Mao Zedong always adhered to this line, and the vast majority of comrades in the Party followed this line, the Chinese revolution finally achieved a great victory.
    It must be pointed out that Comrade Mao Zedong's line was also the line of establishing red political power. However, at that time, not many comrades could consciously understand and accept this line. Therefore, when the enemy's third "encirclement and suppression" approached Jinggang Mountain, some comrades in the Party developed a pessimistic mood, raised the question of "how long will the red flag be waved," and expressed doubt about Comrade Mao Zedong's prediction that warlord wars would rise again. Even the Party Central Committee at that time believed that warlord wars would not break out and asked Comrades Mao Zedong and Zhu De to reduce the size of their troops and personally leave the troops to go to big cities. Comrade Mao Zedong waged a resolute struggle against this pessimistic mood. He answered this question at the First Congress of the Xianggan Border Region Party in May 1928, and then wrote this article to systematically answer it theoretically. Comrade Mao Zedong eliminated those doubts and pessimistic moods, strengthened the confidence of the entire Party, and ideologically armed the Party, thus making "the Chinese revolutionary movement, from then on, had a correct theoretical foundation." [4]
    Comrade Mao Zedong later recalled this issue and said: "Because this is the most basic issue, without answering the question of whether the Chinese revolutionary base areas and the Chinese Red Army can exist and develop, we cannot move forward." [5]
    Why could red political power emerge in China and exist and develop for a long time? Comrade Mao Zedong believed that there were several main conditions at that time: first, China was a large semi-colonial country with unbalanced political and economic development. China's local agricultural economy and the imperialists' policy of dividing spheres of influence for exploitation created long-term divisions and wars between white regimes, creating a condition that allowed a small or several small red areas to occur and persist in the encirclement of surrounding white regimes; second, the influence of the First Revolutionary Civil War remained in the people in vast areas of China; third, the national revolutionary situation continued to develop; fourth, there was a Red Army to support the red political power, and the existence of a considerable number of formal Red Army troops was a necessary condition for the existence of red political power; fifth, there was a Communist Party with a strong organization and correct policies to lead the red political power.
    Based on the above analysis, Comrade Mao Zedong asserted: "We only need to know that the division and war of China's white regime are continuous, then the occurrence, existence, and increasing development of red political power is undoubtedly." "Not only is the long-term existence of small red areas not doubtful, but these red areas will continue to develop and gradually approach the acquisition of national political power." [6]
    Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out that whether the Party's guidance is correct or not has a very important relationship to the persistence and development of red political power. The strategy prescribed by Comrade Mao Zedong was: "Resolutely fight against the enemy, create political power in the middle section of the Luoxiao Mountains, oppose flightism; deeply conduct land revolution in the separatist areas; the army-party helps the development of the local party, the regular army helps the development of the local armed forces; concentrate the Red Army to deal with the current enemy as the situation arises, oppose dividing forces, avoid being defeated by the enemy one by one; the expansion of the separatist areas adopts a wave-like advancement policy, oppose adventurist policies." [7] These strategies are correct entirely because Comrade Mao Zedong has a correct analysis of the situation, is good at distinguishing the rupture period and the relatively stable period of the ruling class, is good at distinguishing the different interests of different enemies to the revolution, and utilizes internal contradictions of the enemy. It is precisely because of these correct strategies that the border political power at that time was able to defeat the enemy's several offensives and continue to expand.
    In this article, Comrade Mao Zedong also made a profound and comprehensive analysis of the concept of establishing red political power. Comrade Mao Zedong believed that this red political power, which can exist and develop for a long time in the surrounding white regimes (that is, reflects the long-term nature of the revolution), must contain three aspects: peasant land revolution; popular armed forces; and the construction of revolutionary base areas. These three aspects are closely combined, interdependent, and indispensable. The peasant land revolution is the basic content of China's democratic revolution; armed struggle is the main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution; and the revolutionary base area is the basis for the Party to lead the armed struggle to implement the land revolution. These three aspects are closely combined to form a general and complete concept, which is the concept of "red political power," the concept of "workers' and peasants' armed separation," and the concept of "gathering strength in the countryside, using the countryside to encircle the cities, and then seize the cities." Comrade Mao Zedong skillfully combined the three, creatively solving the problem of establishing red political power in China. It must also be pointed out that the formation and victory of this general concept was the result of Comrade Mao Zedong using great efforts to fight against and overcome blind actionism and cancellationism, banditry, and localism. This is also something we must understand.
    Comrade Mao Zedong attached great importance to the great significance of the existence and development of the newly born Red Army and red political power at that time. He believed that this was the starting point for leading the Chinese revolution to national victory and the most important factor in promoting the national revolutionary high tide. In view of the lack of understanding among some comrades in the Party, Comrade Mao Zedong later specifically discussed this point in the article "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" and emphatically pointed out: "It must be like this in order to establish the belief of the revolutionary masses throughout the country, like the Soviet Union to the whole world. It must be like this in order to give the reactionary ruling class great difficulties, shake its foundation, and promote its internal disintegration. It must also be like this in order to truly create the Red Army and become the main tool for the future great revolution. In short, it must be like this in order to promote the high tide of the revolution." [8]
    In this way, Comrade Mao Zedong, based on his scientific analysis, prescribed the path for establishing revolutionary political power under the specific conditions of China. The characteristic of this path is not to seize national political power after launching the masses through long-term legal struggle, as in capitalist countries; but to establish small rural base area political power through armed forces, and through long-term armed struggle, finally develop to achieve national political power. The brilliance of Comrade Mao Zedong's theory illuminated the Chinese revolution and guided the Chinese people to achieve revolutionary victory.
    All opinions that opposed Comrade Mao Zedong's correct line suffered a complete bankruptcy in the actual process of history. The representatives of various "Left" leaning lines during the Ten-Year Civil War once opposed and rejected Comrade Mao Zedong's line, and even slandered Comrade Mao Zedong's opinions as so-called "local views and conservative views of peasant consciousness" and "gun barrel-ism," believing that "encircling the cities from the countryside" was an "extremely wrong" concept, and that "separation" was impossible. Ignoring the characteristics of China's situation, the "Left" opportunists stubbornly took the city as the center, fantasized about a national revolution that would develop equally and balancedly, fantasized that the revolution would suddenly win throughout the country, and disregarded and opposed Comrade Mao Zedong's proposal to carry out arduous work and struggle in the countryside for a long time, resulting in great losses to the revolution. The facts finally determined who was "extremely wrong" and who was completely correct. (III)
    What is the reason that Comrade Mao Zedong's theory can be so correct and have such a huge guiding force? In this article, Comrade Mao Zedong has already given us an answer. In studying this article, we should get extremely beneficial inspiration from this aspect.
    Marxism-Leninism teaches us that in deciding all strategic steps, we must clearly analyze the specific actual situation, estimate the comparative relationship of class forces, and the degree of political awareness of the broad masses. Comrade Mao Zedong did just that. Comrade Mao Zedong was a loyal student of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and a master of using the weapon of Marxism-Leninism to solve Chinese problems. From the first day he entered the Chinese revolutionary cause, Comrade Mao Zedong focused on applying the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism to engage in investigation and research on the actual situation of Chinese society; the theory on establishing red political power that he elaborated in this article, as well as the political line, military line, and organizational line that he prescribed during the Land Revolutionary War period, were precisely "based on the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, based on dialectical materialism and historical materialism, specifically analyzed the realistic situation and characteristics at home and abroad and inside and outside the Party at that time, and specifically summarized the brilliant achievements of the historical experience of the Chinese revolution, especially the historical experience of the revolution from 1924 to 1927." [9]
    Comrade Mao Zedong's method of analyzing and solving Chinese problems is the method of linking theory with practice, the method of "seeking truth from facts." Even during the Ten-Year Civil War, he often emphasized that "no investigation, no right to speak"; during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he also wanted us to "start from the actual situation at home and abroad, inside and outside the province, inside and outside the county, inside and outside the district, and draw from it its inherent and not fabricated regularity, that is, to find the internal connection of surrounding events, as the guide for our actions." [10] After the failure of the First Revolutionary Civil War, Comrade Mao Zedong correctly analyzed the Chinese social situation and the revolutionary situation, and found the only correct development law of the Chinese revolution. This is: "Because at the present stage, China is a large semi-colonial and semi-feudal country under the rule of several powerful and internally contradictory imperialist countries and Chinese feudal forces, its economic and political development has great imbalance and disunity, which stipulates the extreme imbalance of the development of China's new democratic revolution, so that the victory of the revolution in the whole country cannot but go through a long period of tortuous struggle; at the same time, this struggle can widely use the contradictions of the enemy, and first establish and maintain armed revolutionary base areas in the vast areas where the enemy's rule is relatively weak." [11] Comrade Mao Zedong used the above-mentioned law of the Chinese revolution to guide the Chinese revolution, and prescribed a revolutionary line of encircling and finally seizing the cities occupied by the counter-revolution from the armed revolutionary countryside, that is, establishing red political power. Since this line is based on the scientific analysis of the Chinese situation by Marxism-Leninism, it is the only correct line that completely conforms to the objective law of the Chinese revolution. And all the wrong "Left" leaning and right-leaning lines, since they do not understand and violate the basic law of the Chinese revolution, they will inevitably be bloodied in the face of reality.
    Following Comrade Mao Zedong's line, the Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people to achieve the victory of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution, established the People's Republic of China, and began the gradual transition to socialism. The task of the Chinese people in the future, according to Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, is to gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization under the leadership of the working class (through the Chinese Communist Party) over a considerable period of time, and gradually realize the socialist transformation of the state's agriculture, handicraft industry, and private industry and commerce, in order to ensure the steady growth of the proportion of socialist components in the national economy, and ensure the gradual improvement of the people's material and cultural life on the basis of developing production. The stipulation of this task is also based on the specific political and economic situation of Chinese society and conforms to the objective law of Chinese social development. Old China was an economically very backward agricultural country. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, this situation has been changing year by year. But to fundamentally change this situation in China requires a considerable period of time. The economic components and class situation in New China are complex, and the characteristics of political and economic imbalance will continue to play a role for a long time to come. The Party must formulate policies based on this situation and characteristics. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong earnestly advises us that "the method of determining the work policy according to the actual situation" is a basic work method that all Communist Party members and revolutionary workers must firmly remember. Comrade Mao Zedong set an example for us with the strategic thinking expounded in this article. Facts have proved that all wrong lines and policies are due to the fact that they have departed from the actual situation at that time and place and subjectively determined their work policies.
    Striving to understand Marxism-Leninism, learning Comrade Mao Zedong's stand, viewpoint, method, and strategic thinking, and better building our country, is the inspiration we should get from commemorating the 25th anniversary of the publication of "Why Can China's Red Political Power Exist?"

    纪念“中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？”发表二十五周年
    傅钟
    “一切革命底根本问题，就是国家政权问题。”〔一〕中国共产党从它成立的时候起，首先就为了推翻帝国主义及其在中国的走狗底反动统治，建立一个新民主主义的中国而斗争。在这一斗争中，毛泽东同志关于建立革命政权的理论，起了巨大的指导作用。毛泽东同志在一九二八年十月五日发表的“中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？”一文，就是他关于政权问题的辉煌论著之一。在这篇文章中，毛泽东同志创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍原理与中国革命的具体实践相结合，答复了第一次国内革命战争失败后在中国革命问题上具有决定意义的一个理论问题——关于红军和红色政权能否存在和发展的问题，并确定了以武装斗争为革命斗争的主要形式和以乡村包围城市然后取得城市的革命方针。中国革命的实践过程，充分地证实了毛泽东同志这一理论的正确性。（一）
    第一次国内革命战争失败之后，中国共产党曾经处在一个极其复杂的环境和极其严重的时期。这时摆在中国共产党和中国人民面前的问题，是如何保存革命的有生力量，从新建立革命的阵地，准备新的大革命并保证其胜利。党的任务，首先就是要正确地分析当时的形势，指出革命斗争的正确道路。
    毛泽东同志在“中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？”中，首先对当时的政治形势作了极其英明的分析。他指出：“国民党新军阀的统治，依然是城市买办阶级和乡村豪绅阶级的统治，对外投降帝国主义，对内以新军阀代替旧军阀，对工农阶级的经济的剥削和政治的压迫比从前更加厉害。……全国工农平民以至资产阶级，依然在反革命统治底下，没有得到丝毫政治上经济上的解放。”他接着指出了中国革命的性质和任务：“中国迫切需要一个资产阶级的民主革命，这个革命必须由无产阶级领导才能完成。”“中国的民主革命的内容……包括推翻帝国主义及其工具军阀在中国的统治，完成民族革命，并实行土地革命，消灭豪绅阶级对农民的封建的剥削。”〔二〕
    和毛泽东同志的正确分析相反，陈独秀分子在革命失败后宣称：中国的资产阶级民主革命已因资产阶级的胜利而终结，资产阶级已经建立了并将巩固它的统治，中国无产阶级应当放弃革命斗争，转入合法运动，以待将来举行社会主义革命。陈独秀分子由此变成了取消主义者，并走上了与托洛茨基分子结合的反革命道路。
    那么，当时的革命处在怎样的形势？是高潮还是低潮？这是党决定斗争策略的出发点。毛泽东同志认定当时的革命是处在低潮，并以他自己亲身经验提出有力的证明：“我们一年来转战各地，深感全国革命潮流的低落。”〔三〕但毛泽东同志同时又预见到革命高潮一定要到来，并且会比较迅速地到来。他这个预见是由分析当时形势，洞察当时引起革命高潮的各种矛盾发展的情况而得出的结论。
    既然革命是处在低潮，党的策略无疑地应该是退却而不是进攻。这就是说，党应当迅速收集革命力量，在敌人的进攻面前组织有秩序的退却和防御。一九二七年十月，毛泽东同志领导工农革命军向井冈山的进军，正确地解决了这个策略问题。但是，向井冈山的进军，不是单纯的退却，而同时是对反革命的进攻。毛泽东同志巧妙地把革命的退却和进攻结合起来，表现了他对马克思列宁主义策略创造性的运用。革命力量在城市退却下来，在农村却展开了进攻；革命虽然暂时失掉了城市，却武装割据了农村，使农村成为退却的中心阵地，同时又是举行进攻的新方向。这种进攻的直接目标是反对帝国主义的走狗——叛卖革命的国民党，反对封建地主阶级；进攻的道路是土地革命、武装斗争和建立革命根据地。
    和毛泽东同志的正确认识相反，这时党内产生了第一次“左”倾路线。这个“左”倾路线由于不能正确认识中国社会性质以及革命的任务，混淆了民主革命和社会主义革命的一定界限，并主观地急于超过民主革命；在估计形势时仍然认为当时是革命高潮，把敌人估计为“十分动摇”、“恐慌万状”，因而拒绝退却，采取了盲动主义的策略，结果使进攻遭受失败。
    毛泽东同志的这篇文章，首先使全党同志对当时的局势有了清醒的认识，澄清了当时党内外的思想混乱，并指示了一个明确的斗争方向。（二）
    一九二七年革命失败以后，毛泽东同志根据对中国社会情况以及革命形势的分析，认定中国革命在城市中被强大的敌人击败后，暂时无法在城市中取得胜利，因此，就必须制定一条革命路线，即在农村聚积力量，用农村包围城市，然后取得城市的路线。由于毛泽东同志始终坚持了，以及全党绝大多数同志遵循了这条路线，中国革命终于取得了伟大的胜利。
    必须指出：毛泽东同志的这条路线，同时也就是建立红色政权的路线。但是在当时，能够自觉地理解和接受这条路线的同志还不太多。因此，当敌人第三次“围剿”临到井冈山的时候，党内有些同志就产生了一种悲观情绪，提出“红旗到底打得多久”的疑问，并对毛泽东同志对于军阀混战必将再起的预断表示怀疑。甚至当时的党中央也认为军阀战争不会爆发，要毛泽东、朱德同志将部队化小，本人离开部队到大城市去。毛泽东同志向这种悲观情绪作了坚决的斗争。他在一九二八年五月湘赣边区党的第一次代表大会上回答了这个问题，接着又写了这篇文章有系统地作了理论上的回答。毛泽东同志扫除了那些怀疑和悲观情绪，坚定了全党的信心，在思想上武装了党，因而使“中国革命运动，从此就有了正确的理论基础”。〔四〕
    毛泽东同志后来回忆这个问题时说：“因为这是一个最基本的问题，不答复中国革命根据地和中国红军能否存在和发展的问题，我们就不能前进一步。”〔五〕
    为什么红色政权能够在中国产生并能长期存在与发展呢？毛泽东同志认为当时有如下几个主要条件：第一，中国是一个政治、经济发展不平衡的半殖民地的大国，中国的地方性的农业经济和帝国主义者对于中国所实行的划分势力范围的分裂剥削政策，产生了白色政权间长期的分裂和战争，造成了一种条件，因而使一小块或若干小块的红色区域，能够在四围白色政权包围中发生和坚持下来；第二，第一次国内革命战争的影响，还遗留在中国广大区域的人民中；第三，全国革命形势是继续向前发展的；第四，有支持红色政权的红军，而相当力量的正式红军的存在，是红色政权存在的必要条件；第五，有领导红色政权的组织坚强、政策正确的共产党。
    基于以上的分析，毛泽东同志断言：“我们只须知道中国白色政权的分裂和战争是继续不断的，则红色政权的发生、存在并且日益发展，便是无疑的了。”“不但小块红色区域的长期存在没有疑义，而且这些红色区域将继续发展，日渐接近于全国政权的取得。”〔六〕
    毛泽东同志同时指出了党的指导之正确与否，对于红色政权的坚持和发展有十分重要的关系。毛泽东同志规定的策略是：“坚决地和敌人作斗争，创造罗霄山脉中段政权，反对逃跑主义；深入割据地区的土地革命；军队党帮助地方党的发展，正规军队帮助地方武装的发展；集中红军相机应付当前之敌，反对分兵，避免被敌人各个击破；割据地区的扩大采取波浪式的推进政策，反对冒进政策。”〔七〕这些策略之所以正确，完全是由于毛泽东同志对形势有正确的分析，善于区分统治阶级的破裂时期与比较稳定时期，善于区别不同敌人对革命的不同利害关系，利用敌人内部矛盾。正由于有这些正确的策略，当时的边界政权才能够战胜敌人数次进攻，而且日益扩大。
    毛泽东同志在这一篇文章中，对于建立红色政权的观念，也作了深刻的全面的分析。毛泽东同志认为，这种在四围白色政权中能够长期存在（即反映革命的长期性）和发展的红色政权，必须包含着三个方面，即：农民土地革命；民众武装；革命根据地建设。这三个方面是密切结合，相依为命，缺一不可的。农民土地革命，是中国民主革命的基本内容；武装斗争，是中国革命的主要斗争形式；革命根据地，是党领导武装斗争实行土地革命的依托。这三个方面密切结合在一起，形成一个总的完整的观念，就是“红色政权”的观念，就是“工农武装割据”的观念，也就是“在农村聚集力量，用农村包围城市，然后取得城市”的观念。毛泽东同志巧妙地将三者结合在一起，创造性地解决了在中国建立红色政权的问题。还须指出，这个总观念的形成和胜利，乃是毛泽东同志用了很大的力量去同盲动主义与取消主义、流寇主义与地方主义作斗争并将它们克服的结果。这一点也是我们所必须了解的。
    毛泽东同志极端重视当时新生的红军和红色政权的存在和发展的重大意义，他认为这是把中国革命引向全国胜利的出发点，是促进全国革命高潮的最重大的因素。鉴于党内有些同志认识之不足，毛泽东同志后来在“星星之火，可以燎原”一文中又专门论述了这一点，并着重指出：“必须这样，才能树立全国革命群众的信仰，如苏联之于全世界然。必须这样，才能给反动统治阶级以甚大的困难，动摇其基础而促进其内部的分解。也必须这样，才能真正地创造红军，成为将来大革命的主要工具。总而言之，必须这样，才能促进革命的高潮。”〔八〕
    这样，毛泽东同志就根据他的科学分析，规定了在中国的具体条件下，建立革命政权的道路。这条道路的特点不是经过长期合法斗争，发动群众后夺取全国政权，像资本主义国家那样；而是以武装建立小块农村根据地政权，经过长期武装斗争，最后发展到取得全国政权。毛泽东同志理论的光辉照耀着中国革命，指引着中国人民取得了革命胜利。
    一切反对过毛泽东同志正确路线的意见，都在历史的实际进程中遭到了彻底的破产。十年内战时期中的各次“左”倾路线的代表者，曾经反对与拒绝过毛泽东同志的路线，甚至污蔑毛泽东同志的意见为所谓“农民意识的地方观念与保守观念”和
  “枪杆子主义”，认为“以农村来包围城市”是“极端错误”的观念，认为“割据”是不可能的事。“左”倾机会主义者不顾中国情况的特点，固执地以城市为中心，幻想全国一律平衡发展的革命，幻想革命一下子会在全国胜利，轻视和反对毛泽东同志关于在农村中长期进行艰苦工作和斗争的主张，结果使革命遭受极大的损失。事实终于判明了谁是“极端错误”的，谁是完全正确的。（三）
    什么原因使毛泽东同志的理论能够这样正确和有巨大的指导力量呢？在这篇文章中，毛泽东同志已经给了我们一个解答。学习这篇文章，我们正应该从这方面得到极为有益的启示。
    马克思列宁主义教导我们，在决定一切策略步骤时，必须明确分析具体的实际情况，估量阶级力量的对比关系和广大群众的政治觉悟程度。毛泽东同志正是这样做的。毛泽东同志是马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的忠实学生，是运用马克思列宁主义这个武器来解决中国问题的能手。毛泽东同志从他进入中国革命事业的第一天起，就着重于应用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理以从事对中国社会实际情况的调查研究；他在这篇文章中所阐述的关于建立红色政权的理论以及在土地革命战争时期所规定的政治路线、军事路线和组织路线，正是他“根据马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，根据辩证唯物论和历史唯物论，具体地分析了当时国内外党内外的现实情况及其特点，并具体地总结了中国革命的历史经验、特别是一九二四年至一九二七年革命的历史经验的光辉的成果。”〔九〕
    毛泽东同志分析和解决中国问题的方法，是理论和实际联系的方法，是“实事求是”的方法。还在十年内战时期，他就经常强调“没有调查就没有发言权”；在抗日战争时期，他又要我们“从国内外、省内外、县内外、区内外的实际情况出发，从其中引出其固有的而不是臆造的规律性，即找出周围事变的内部联系，作为我们行动的向导。”〔十〕毛泽东同志在第一次国内革命战争失败后，正确地分析了中国社会情况及革命形势，找出了中国革命唯一正确的发展规律。这就是：“由于现阶段的中国是在强大而又内部互相矛盾的几个帝国主义国家和中国封建势力统治之下的半殖民地半封建的大国，其经济和政治的发展具有极大的不平衡性和不统一性，这就规定了中国新民主主义革命的发展之极大的不平衡性，使革命在全国的胜利不能不经历长期的曲折的斗争；同时又使这一斗争能广泛地利用敌人的矛盾，在敌人的统治比较薄弱的广大地区首先建立和保持武装的革命根据地。”〔十一〕毛泽东同志根据上述中国革命这一规律来指导中国革命，就规定了以武装革命的农村包围并最后夺取反革命占据的城市，亦即建立红色政权的这样一条革命路线。这条路线既然是根据马克思列宁主义对中国情况的科学分析，它就是完全符合于中国革命客观规律的唯一正确的路线。而一切错误的“左”倾和右倾的路线，既然不了解和违反了中国革命的基本规律，它们就必然要在现实面前碰得头破血流。
    中国共产党遵循着毛泽东同志的路线，领导中国人民取得了中国新民主主义革命的胜利，建立了中华人民共和国，并开始了向社会主义的逐步过渡。今后中国人民的任务，根据毛泽东同志的指示，是要在工人阶级（经过中国共产党）领导下，在一个相当长的时期内逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步实现国家对农业，对手工业和对私营工商业的社会主义改造，以保证国民经济中社会主义成份的比重稳步增长，保证在发展生产的基础上逐步提高人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平。这个任务的规定，同样是从中国社会的具体政治、经济情况出发，符合于中国社会发展的客观规律的。旧中国是一个经济非常落后的农业国家，中华人民共和国成立后，这种情况是逐年在起变化的。但要根本改变中国这种情况，是需要一个相当长的时期的。新中国的经济成分和阶级情况是复杂的，政治经济不平衡的特点在今后一个长时期中还起着作用。党制定政策就必须从这种情况和特点出发。因此毛泽东同志谆谆告诫我们“按照实际情况决定工作方针”的这个方法，是一切共产党员和革命工作者所必须牢牢记住的基本的工作方法。毛泽东同志在这篇文章中所阐述的策略思想给我们作了一个典范。事实证明，一切错误的路线和政策，考其原因，都是由于离开了当时当地的实际情况，主观地决定自己的工作方针之故。
    努力领会马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东同志的立场、观点、方法和策略思想，更好地建设我们的国家，这就是我们纪念“中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？”发表二十五周年应当得到的启示。〔一〕“列宁文选”，莫斯科中文版，第二卷，
