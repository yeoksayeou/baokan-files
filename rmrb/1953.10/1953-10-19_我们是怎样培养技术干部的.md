    How We Cultivate Technical Cadres
    Central Heavy Industry Department Design Company

    Editor's Note: This article is a summary made by the Central Heavy Industry Department in June of this year. Their experience still has reference value for other units today, so it is published here.

    Over the past two years, we have explored some experiences and achieved some results in the work of cultivating and training technical cadres. In terms of improving on-the-job cadres, in the past two years, 235 trainees have been promoted to apprentice technicians, 91 apprentice technicians have been promoted to technicians, 4 technicians have been promoted to assistant engineers, and 2 deputy engineers have been promoted to engineers. At the same time, everyone's technical level has greatly improved. For example, among engineers and assistant engineers, there are now seven who are responsible for overall design. Most technicians and apprentice technicians can now independently carry out design, or carry out the design of some projects under the guidance of engineers. In terms of cultivating new forces, more than 500 technical cadres have been trained in the past two years. They have played a great role in design and survey work. For example, our water and heating design work is entirely undertaken by students who have graduated from training classes. They not only successfully completed the design tasks, but also learned the Soviet heating calculation methods, saving a lot of investment. Electrical lighting design work is also undertaken by students from training classes under the guidance of one or two older technicians. They also actively learn new Soviet methods, creating a standard switchboard design; recently, the method of working according to instruction charts has been promoted, and work efficiency has increased three to six times. Students in the drafting training class, after a year of training, can undertake the work of drawing construction drawings. Students in the engineering geology and surveying training classes are now also successfully completing various work tasks.

    Our methods for improving existing technical cadres mainly rely on Soviet experts, learning from Soviet experience, and cultivating young technical cadres to drive the old technicians.

    The reason why our technical cadres have been able to improve so quickly is inseparable from the help of Soviet experts. For example, the new structural design standard was quickly learned because of the patient education and concrete help of Soviet expert Comrade Tyunizov in terms of thought and technology. At the beginning, we didn't know how to do general layout design, so Soviet expert Comrade Zavaszki taught us at any time in the work, and helped us to set up a special training class to train general layout designers. With the help of Soviet experts, we also learned new daylighting calculation methods, heating calculation methods, factory building design principles, flat roof design, Soviet drafting methods, and how to carry out standard design and other advanced experiences. In particular, in terms of engineering geology, everything was learned from the Soviet Union. For example, the drilling method was changed to the Soviet-style drilling rig and undisturbed soil sampling method; the determination of ground bearing capacity was changed to soil analysis; the operation and requirements of soil analysis and water quality analysis, the records and descriptions of the site, and the contents of the report were learned. In terms of surveying, we learned Soviet three-wire leveling, Babov adjustment, and Soviet map joining methods. It is in this way that we rely on Soviet experts and learn from Soviet experience that we can quickly improve the technical level of our cadres.

    How can we quickly learn from Soviet experience to improve the technical level of cadres? At the beginning, we relied on the old technicians to educate the young technical cadres through them. However, as a result of doing so, Soviet experience was not well implemented, and the technical level was not quickly improved. The reason is that some old technicians had a lot of resistance to Soviet experience in their minds and were unwilling to learn. For example, some engineers used British and American specifications to counter Soviet standards. Soviet experts suggested paying attention to fire protection design and the health and safety of employees; but some engineers thought it was unnecessary, saying that workers don't need to pay attention to hygiene. When the leadership proposed to implement the expert's suggestions, some engineers said: "I will do it if I get a raise, and I won't do it if I don't get a raise." Soviet expert Comrade Romaniuk enthusiastically guided an old technician to study the investigation of factory base geology, but this old technician did not humbly learn, and led the expert to the mountain to see the rocks, asking the expert if he knew rocks and minerals; the expert gave him a code for the investigation of engineering geology, and he hid it in his own bag, not letting anyone see it; when a Soviet expert told an engineer of the surveying team about a new surveying method, he promised to do it in person, and as soon as the expert left, he told the cadres below not to do it that way. When young technical cadres have not yet been trained, some old technicians think that the company can't do without them, and often threaten the leadership with resignation. The above situations have made us deeply realize that we must cultivate young technical cadres and drive the progress of old technicians.

    We have adopted the following methods to cultivate young technical cadres:

    First, organize young technical cadres to take the lead in learning Soviet experience. When the old technicians were still resisting Soviet experience, some young students were spontaneously learning from the Soviet Union. We supported the demands of young students and mobilized them to take the lead in learning Soviet experience. At the beginning of 1952, we organized a study class, mainly composed of young students, to first study the Soviet method of reinforced concrete design, and then study the entire new structural design standard. In terms of engineering geology and surveying, young cadres also took the lead, met directly with Soviet experts, and invited Soviet experts to give lectures. The new methods that have been learned are promoted throughout the company, and the active learners are commended and rewarded, and everyone is mobilized to continue learning from the Soviet Union. After we did this, the learning enthusiasm of young cadres became even higher, and their technical level also increased.

    Second, boldly use young technical cadres and cultivate them in their work. At the beginning, some engineers proposed that young college students must first draw construction drawings, and can only do design after drawing construction drawings for three years. We believe that construction drawings can be drawn, but it doesn't take that long. Our method is: let young technical cadres work with old technical cadres after short-term study and on-site visits. When problems are encountered in the work, ask the old technical cadres or Soviet experts to help solve them. In addition, when discussing design or survey work, in addition to inviting engineers to participate, young cadres are also absorbed to participate in the discussion. In this way, on the one hand, the prejudices of some old technicians can be overcome, and on the other hand, the level of young cadres can be improved.

    Third, promote young cadres to take on leadership positions. In 1952, we promoted a group of activists from young cadres to take on the work of design group leaders, survey detachment leaders, and technical secretaries; in March this year, we promoted more than ten young technical cadres to take on leadership positions such as section chiefs and team leaders. After these cadres took on leadership work, the morale of the masses generally rose, and advanced experiences and methods appeared in various units. For example, various unified calculation charts in design, the design of standard components, the design method of professional division of labor, the plasticity test method in engineering geology, the lever lifting drilling method, the plummet ranging method in surveying, and the new tape stretcher were all created after the young cadres took on leadership work.

    Fourth, organize collective research and go to other units to learn. There are very few experienced people among our technical cadres, especially in water and heating and electrical lighting design. We have neither engineers nor Soviet experts. In this case, the main method for us to solve technical problems and improve everyone's work level is to organize collective research and discussions to exchange personal learning experiences. If there are problems that cannot be solved, we send people to other units to learn from Soviet experts or other experienced people. For example, at the beginning, everyone didn't understand the design of weak electricity very well, so we sent people to the Electrical Industry Administration to learn, and then explain it to everyone after returning, so that the design of weak electricity can be done. In terms of water and heating, we sent people to Angang to learn from Soviet experts, which solved many technical problems. In addition, for major designs, we also implement the method of joint review to improve everyone's technical level in the common review of the design.

    Fifth, organize on-site visits to learn advanced designs. We have organized technical cadres to visit the Harbin Flax Factory, the Electric Engineering Fourth Factory, the Machinery Tenth Factory, the Harbin Medical University, the Northeast Institute of Technology in Shenyang, the Tiexi Workers' Village, and the large rolling mill and seamless steel pipe factory of Angang and other projects. After the visit, we organized everyone to discuss and invited the engineer of the Flax Factory to give us a report, explaining the superiority of the Flax Factory design. Through on-site visits, everyone has improved technically. For example, the design of mixed lintels was learned after visiting the Flax Factory. After visiting the newly built factory building of the Machinery Tenth Factory, everyone realized that the development of the entire factory must be considered when designing the factory building, otherwise it will cause historical errors. This approach is the most profound for the education of technical cadres, especially for young technical cadres.

    In addition to on-site visits, studying advanced design drawings is also a good way to improve cadres. For example, we studied the general layout design drawing of the Flax Factory, and we have greatly improved in the general layout design.

    Sixth, conduct regular work summaries. In 1951, we conducted a year-end summary, focusing on criticizing the mistakes caused by resisting Soviet experience and causing losses to the country, laying a solid ideological foundation for learning from the Soviet Union in 1952. In the summer of 1952, a mid-year work summary was conducted, clearly recognizing that design work must attach importance to survey and investigation, strengthening the design personnel's attention to design data, and starting to actively and plannedly collect data. In the year-end summary of 1952, it was emphasized that advanced design ideas must be established, and a movement to criticize wrong design ideas was launched. In May of this year, the planned management of design work was initially summarized, and the method of working according to instruction charts was promoted. Through these work summaries, all cadres have received a great education. In addition to regular work summaries, a summary should also be conducted after each project design is completed. Last winter, we focused on summarizing several projects, which was of great educational significance to everyone; but we have not done enough in this regard, and many projects have not been summarized.

    Using the above methods, a college student can carry out the design of some projects after half a year, and can independently carry out design after one year. A higher vocational graduate can also undertake the design tasks of some projects after one year.

    After the young technical cadres are improved, some old technicians who do not make progress feel that it is impossible not to make progress, and most people also follow up to learn Soviet experience. At the same time, because most of the young cadres have been able to do design work, some old technicians have less of the idea that they can't do without them. Of course, in the process of cultivating young technical cadres, attention must be paid to uniting the old technical personnel. Because the old technical personnel, except for a few, have a certain amount of experience. In the work, don't make them feel pessimistic and disappointed, or feel that everyone is excluding them. Especially after they have the desire to make progress, the young technical cadres should be educated to respect them in their work and consult them more in terms of technology. This will further promote the progress of old technical personnel and strengthen the unity of new and old technical cadres.

    For the cultivation and training of new forces, we mainly adopted the method of running quick schools. Various classes are run in the quick school. The teachers of the quick school, on the one hand, hire some teachers who can teach part-time or substitute from local schools or technical departments (it would be better if experts can be hired to give lectures), and on the other hand, the company draws a few engineers or technicians as full-time teachers or teach part-time. The teaching materials are to buy some ready-made textbooks, and the rest are compiled by the teachers themselves according to the teaching principles and requirements. Most of the students are young students who have dropped out of school and are unemployed, and a small number are cadres with higher cultural levels drawn from their jobs. Generally, those with a high school degree or above can participate in water and heating, electrical lighting or advanced engineering geology classes; those with a junior high school degree can participate in surveying, drafting, soil analysis or elementary engineering geology classes; surveyors and tracers only need to have a high school degree.

    In the past two years, our experience in running quick schools to train cadres is that the technical cadres of the design department must be actively cultivated in addition to the allocation from the higher authorities. In particular, some junior and intermediate technical cadres cannot completely rely on the higher authorities to solve the problem. As long as the design department actively thinks of ways, it can cultivate a large number of technical cadres. The classes of the quick school should be opened according to the needs of the work. What kind of talents are needed for the current work tasks, then train what kind of talents. Because the tasks of the country are waiting for them, the teachers teach with enthusiasm, and the students also learn with enthusiasm. The learning subjects of the quick school must concentrate on attacking one subject, and in one subject, they must also learn the courses that are most needed in the work, otherwise the requirements of quick training will not be met. As for general knowledge, you can continue to study in future work. In addition to general scientific knowledge, the content of teaching should be more related to the problems in actual work. For example, when talking about engineering geological soil sampling and measuring groundwater, we link it to the mistakes that occurred in the past due to not paying attention to this work and the losses caused to the country. This can make students learn more deeply and also have interest. At the same time, more internships should be organized in the study so that students can quickly take on work tasks after graduation.

    In terms of training new technical cadres, our shortcoming is that we have not done enough ideological education for students, and we have not paid enough attention to the business study of students in their work after graduation, which needs to be continued in the future.

    我们是怎样培养技术干部的
    中央重工业部设计公司
    编者按：本文是中央重工业部在今年六月所做的总结。他们的经验在今天对其他单位仍有参考价值，故发表于此。
    两年来，我们在培养和训练技术干部的工作中，摸索到了一些经验，取得了一些成绩。在提高在职干部方面，两年来由练习生提为见习技术员的有二百三十五名，由见习技术员提为技术员的有九十一名，由技术员提为助理工程师的四名，由副工程师提为工程师的两名。同时，大家的技术水平都有很大的提高。如工程师和助理工程师中，现在有七名在做设计总负责人的工作。技术员和见习技术员大部已经可以独立进行设计，或在工程师的指导下进行部分工程的设计。在培养新生力量方面，两年来共训练出了五百多名技术干部。他们对设计和勘测工作起了很大作用。譬如我们的水道暖气设计工作，完全是由训练班毕业的学生担负的。他们不但胜利地完成了设计任务，而且学习了苏联的采暖计算方法，节省了大量投资。电气照明的设计工作，也是由一两个较老的技术人员指导，由训练班的学生担负的。他们也积极地学习苏联的新方法，创造了标准的配电盘设计；最近并推行了按指示图表工作的方法，工作效率提高了三倍到六倍。制图训练班的学生，经过一年来的培养，已经可以担负绘制施工图的工作。工程地质和测量训练班的学生现在也都在胜利地完成着各项工作任务。
    我们提高现有技术干部的方法，主要是依靠苏联专家，学习苏联经验，和培养青年技术干部带动老的技术人员。
    我们的技术干部所以能够很快地提高，是和苏联专家的帮助分不开的。譬如，新结构设计标准就是由于苏联专家秋尼索夫同志在思想上、技术上耐心地教育，具体地帮助，我们才很快学会的。我们开始时不知道怎样做总平面设计，苏联专家扎瓦斯基同志便在工作中随时教导我们，并帮助我们开办了专门的训练班，培养了总平面设计人员。在苏联专家的帮助下，我们还学习了新的采光计算法、采暖计算法、工厂建筑设计原则、平屋顶的设计、苏联的制图方法，以及如何进行标准设计等先进经验。特别是工程地质方面，全部是向苏联学习的。譬如钻探的方法改用了苏联式钻机和原状取土法；地耐力的确定改用了土壤分析；学会了土壤分析、水质分析的操作和要求，现场的记录和描述，报告书的内容等。在测量方面，学习了苏联的三线水准测量、巴保夫平差，以及苏联的接图方法等。我们就是这样依靠苏联专家，学习苏联经验，才得以迅速地提高了干部的技术水平。
    怎样才能迅速地学到苏联经验来提高干部的技术水平呢？开始时，我们是依赖老的技术人员，通过他们来教育青年技术干部。但是，这样做的结果，苏联经验没有很好地贯彻，技术水平没有很快地提高。原因是有些老技术人员思想上对苏联经验有很多抵触，不愿意学习。譬如有的工程师以英美的规范来对抗苏联的标准。苏联专家建议要注意防火设计和职工的卫生安全；但有的工程师认为不必要，说工人不用讲卫生。领导上提出要贯彻专家建议，有的工程师却说：“给我加薪水就做，不加薪就不做。”苏联专家罗马纽克同志曾热心地指导一位老技术员学习厂基地质的勘察问题，但这位老技术员不虚心学习，把专家领到山上去看岩石，考问专家懂不懂岩石和矿物；专家交给他一本工程地质的勘察规范，他藏在自己的书包里，谁也不让看；测量队的一位工程师，当苏联专家告诉他新的测量方法时，他当面答应做，专家一走，他就告诉下面干部不要这样干。当青年技术干部还没有培养起来的时候，有些老技术人员认为公司离开他们就不行，经常以辞职不干来威胁领导。以上这些情况使我们深刻地体会到：必须培养青年技术干部，并带动老技术人员进步。
    我们培养青年技术干部，采取了以下几种方法：
    第一、组织青年技术干部带头学习苏联经验。当老的技术人员还在抗拒苏联经验的时候，有些青年学生就在自发地向苏联学习。我们支持了青年学生的要求，发动他们带头学习苏联经验。一九五二年初，我们组织了一个学习班，以青年学生为主，首先学习了苏联的钢筋混凝土设计方法，接着又学习了整个的新结构设计标准。在工程地质和测量方面，也以青年干部带头，和苏联专家直接见面，请苏联专家讲课。已经学到的新方法，则在全公司推广，并表扬和奖励学习的积极分子，发动大家继续向苏联学习。我们这样做了之后，青年干部的学习情绪更加高涨，技术水平也随着提高了。
    第二、大胆地使用青年技术干部，在工作中培养。开始时，有的工程师曾提出：青年大学生必须先画施工图，画上三年施工图之后才能做设计。我们认为，施工图可以画，但用不了这样长的时间。我们的办法是：让青年技术干部进行短期学习和实地参观之后，就跟老的技术干部一起工作。工作中遇到问题，就请老技术干部或苏联专家帮助解决。此外，在讨论设计或勘测工作的时候，除了请工程师参加外，也吸收青年干部参加讨论。这样，一方面可以克服一些老技术人员的偏见，另一方面也可以提高青年干部的水平。
    第三、提拔青年干部担负领导工作。一九五二年，我们由青年干部中提拔了一批积极分子，担负设计组长、勘测分队长和技术秘书等工作；今年三月又提拔了十余名青年技术干部担负科长、队长等领导工作。这些干部担负了领导工作之后，群众情绪普遍高涨，各单位都出现了先进的经验和方法。譬如设计方面的各种统一计算图表、标准构件的设计、专业分工的设计方法，工程地质方面可塑性试验方法、杠杆起重的钻探方法，测量方面的垂球量距法、新的拉尺器等，都是在青年干部担负了领导工作之后创造出来的。
    第四、组织集体研究，到其他单位去学习。我们的技术干部中有经验的人很少，特别是水道暖气和电气照明设计方面，我们既没有工程师，也没有苏联专家。在这种情况下，我们解决技术上的问题，提高大家工作水平的主要办法就是组织集体研究和讨论，交流个人的学习心得。有不能解决的问题，就派人到别的单位找苏联专家或其他有经验的人去学习。譬如开始时大家都不很懂弱电的设计，我们就派人到电器工业管理局去学习，回来以后再给大家讲解，这样，弱电的设计就会做了。在水道和暖气方面，我们派人到鞍钢去向苏联专家学习，解决了技术上的很多问题。此外，对主要的设计，我们还实行会审的办法，在共同审核设计当中来提高大家的技术水平。
    第五、组织实地参观，学习先进的设计。我们曾组织技术干部参观了哈尔滨的亚麻厂、电工四厂、机械十厂、哈尔滨医大、沈阳的东北工学院、铁西工人村、鞍钢的大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂等工程。参观以后组织大家讨论，并请亚麻厂的工程师向我们作报告，讲解亚麻厂设计的优越性。通过实地参观，使大家在技术上有了提高。譬如混合过梁的设计就是参观了亚麻厂以后学来的。参观了机械十厂的新建厂房，使大家认识到设计厂房时必须考虑到整个工厂的发展问题，不然就会造成历史性的错误。这种做法，对技术干部的教育最深刻，特别对青年技术干部帮助最大。
    除了实地参观以外，研究先进的设计图纸也是提高干部的一个好方法。譬如我们研究了亚麻厂的总平面设计图，在总平面设计方面得到很大的提高。
    第六、定期总结工作。一九五一年我们进行了一次年终总结，重点地批判了因为抗拒苏联经验给国家造成损失的错误，给一九五二年学习苏联打下了有力的思想基础。一九五二年夏天进行半年工作总结，明确地认识了设计工作必须重视勘察调查，加强了设计人员对设计资料的重视，开始主动积极地和有计划地搜集资料。一九五二年年终总结，强调了必须树立先进的设计思想，开展了批判错误设计思想的运动。今年五月，初步总结了设计工作的计划管理问题，推行了按指示图表进行工作的方法。通过这些工作总结，使全体干部都受到了很大的教育。除了定期的工作总结之外，每一个工程设计完成之后也应进行总结。去年冬天我们有重点地总结了几个工程，对大家的教育很大；但是我们在这方面做得还很不够，许多工程都没有进行总结。
    我们使用以上的办法，一个大学生经过半年之后就可以进行部分工程的设计，一年以后就可以独立进行设计。一个高职毕业生经过一年的时间，也可以担负起一部分工程的设计任务了。
    青年技术干部提高以后，有些不进步的老的技术人员感觉不进步不行了，大部分人也就跟上来学习苏联经验。同时因为大部青年干部都已经能作设计工作，一些老技术人员认为离开他们就不行的思想也少了。当然，在培养青年技术干部当中，必须注意团结老技术人员。因为老的技术人员除个别的以外，都有一定的经验。在工作中，不要使他们感觉悲观失望，或者觉得大家在排斥他们。特别是他们有了进步的要求之后，更应该教育青年技术干部在工作上尊重他们，在技术上多请教他们。这样就会更促使老技术人员进步和加强新老技术干部的团结。
    对于新生力量的培养和训练，我们主要是采取了开办速成学校的办法。在速成学校内开办各种班次。速成学校的教员，一方面由当地学校或技术部门聘请一些可以兼课或代课的教员（若能聘请到专家讲课就更好），一方面由公司抽出几个工程师或技术员作专职教员或兼课。教材是买一部分现成的教科书，其余的则根据教学方针和要求由教员自己编写。学生的来源大部分是招考的失学失业的青年学生，少部分是由工作岗位上抽调的文化较高的干部。一般高中以上程度的可以参加水道暖气、电气照明或高级工程地质班；初中程度的可以参加测量、制图、土壤分析或初级工程地质班；测工和描图员等则有高小程度就可以了。
    两年来，我们在举办速成学校训练干部方面的体会是：设计部门的技术干部，除了上级分配以外，必须主动地积极地培养。特别是一些初级和中级的技术干部，不能完全依赖上级解决。设计部门只要积极想办法，是可以培养出大批的技术干部的。速成学校的班次，应根据工作的需要来开设，当前的工作任务需要什么人才，便训练什么人才。因为国家的任务在等着他们，所以教员教得有劲，学生也学得有劲。速成学校的学习科目必须是集中力量突击一门，在一门之中又要学习工作上最需要的功课，不然便达不到速成的要求。至于一般的知识可以在以后工作中继续学习。教学的内容除了一般的科学知识以外，要多联系实际工作中的问题。譬如讲到工程地质取土样和测量地下水的问题，就联系过去不注意这项工作所发生的错误和给国家造成的损失。这样可使学生学得更深刻，也有兴趣。同时，在学习中要多组织实习，以便学生毕业后可以很快地担负起工作任务。
    在训练新技术干部方面，我们的缺点是对学生的思想教育做得还不够，学生毕业以后在工作中的业务学习还注意得很差，还需要今后继续努力。
