    Continue Efforts to Improve Grain Procurement Work
    September, with the exception of wheat, is the peak season for the marketing of rice and coarse grains. Judging from the national grain procurement situation in September, although it increased by 28.04 percent compared to August and 26.67 percent compared to the same period last year, it only completed 80.11 percent of the monthly plan. Regionally, except for the Northeast, which completed 108.54 percent of the monthly plan, and Inner Mongolia, which completed 232.99 percent, Central South, North China, East China, and Southwest all failed to complete the monthly plan, with the Northwest being the worst, only completing 45.98 percent. Although there are many reasons for the failure to complete the monthly grain procurement plan in September, two points must be promptly noted and quickly improved.
    First, some regions have neglected the grain procurement work in the vast rural primary markets. For example, in some areas of Hubei Province, state-owned grain departments and cooperatives, based on old experience, believed that procuring grain in larger market towns required less effort, less time, and yielded more; while going deep into the vast rural primary markets to procure grain required more effort, more time, and yielded less. Therefore, they were unwilling to go deep into the vast rural areas below the district level for procurement. According to a survey in Jijiaji, Xiaogan County, the state's procurement volume in that market was only about 60 percent. For example, in Shandong Province, the task of coarse grain procurement has not yet been assigned to grassroots points, and the procurement volume of red sorghum in Shuibai on September 20 only accounted for a little more than 25 percent of the market volume. Some regions have even developed a mood of "slackening" and "withdrawing," believing that grain procurement work has come to an end. For example, the procurement office in Liling County, Hunan Province, now only has one person working, and all other personnel have been withdrawn; the procurement committee originally set up in Liuyang County has now stopped working. As a result, the rice procurement volume in both places has decreased from 300,000 jin per day in the past to 100,000 to 200,000 jin, greatly affecting the procurement work.
    Second, many cash crops have recently been put on the market in large quantities, and some cooperatives believe that procuring cash crops requires less effort and yields greater profits, thus relaxing grain procurement work. For example, some cooperatives in Dezhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, in order to avoid procuring grain, have adopted the bad practice of "four no's": not procuring before the time; not procuring during settlement; not procuring on weekdays (only procuring on market days); and not procuring if it is not delivered to the door, in order to restrict farmers from selling grain. Wangsherenzhuang, Licheng County, Taian Prefecture, also did not collect grain from farmers because the cooperative was busy with other businesses. Farmers complained, "We want to sell wheat to the state, but the cooperative will not accept it." In order to procure tobacco leaves, the Changge County Cooperative in Henan Province abolished four grain procurement points. Some cooperatives in Shangqiu County believed that the handling fees for purchasing cotton were high, so they decided not to procure grain, resulting in no one procuring red sorghum and millet in some primary markets. The Baoshan County Cooperative in Jiangsu also stopped procuring rice because of purchasing cotton and grass mats. In addition, the state-owned grain departments in some regions do not rely heavily on cooperatives for procurement, or because of insufficient storage capacity, untimely grain allocation and transportation, and untimely fund allocation, which also leads to grain procurement stoppages.
    Because the state-owned grain departments and cooperatives in these regions have neglected the grain procurement in the vast rural primary markets and relaxed the procurement work, they have created opportunities for illegal grain merchants to exploit farmers. For example, in Xiangyang and Jingzhou areas of Hubei Province, it has been commonly found that unscrupulous merchants take advantage of farmers' urgent need for money before the autumn harvest to depress prices and purchase green seedlings. In some areas, one township was snapped up for more than 1,000 mu of green seedlings. In the Yichang area, illegal grain merchants went to the countryside with department stores and fabrics, and carried out purchases by "exchanging goods for grain." The price of goods was often 20 to 30 percent higher than the market price, causing great losses to farmers.
    In order to do a good job in grain procurement, it is necessary to criticize various incorrect ideas and wrong practices, and strictly manage the market. It must be recognized that after the land reform, the self-sufficient small-scale peasant economy in the vast rural areas has relatively increased, and the market has also changed accordingly. The grain distribution market, which was concentratedly trafficked by vendors in the past, has gradually shrunk, while the grain market volume in the primary markets has relatively expanded. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to the vast rural primary markets, better grasp the source of grain, meet the farmers' needs for selling grain, and enable the state to purchase more grain. The work of procuring grain, cash crops, and local and special products should be arranged correctly to ensure the smooth completion of grain procurement work.

### 继续努力做好粮食收购工作

    继续努力做好粮食收购工作
    九月份除小麦外，正是大米、杂粮上市旺季。从九月份全国粮食收购情况来看，虽比八月增加百分之二十八点零四，比去年同期增加百分之二十六点六七，而月计划仅完成百分之八十点一一。从地区来看，除东北完成月计划百分之一百零八点五四、内蒙完成百分之二百三十二点九九外，中南、华北、华东、西南均未完成月计划，西北最差，仅完成百分之四十五点九八。九月份粮食收购未完成月计划的原因虽然很多，但有两点是必须及时引起注意并迅速加以改进的。
    首先是部分地区忽视广大农村初级市场的粮食收购工作。如湖北省有些地区国营粮食部门和合作社根据旧的经验，以为在较大的集镇上收粮，费力少、时间短、收得多；深入广大农村初级市场收购则费力多、时间慢、收得少，因此不愿深入到区以下的广大农村收购。据孝感县纪家集调查，该集国家的收购量只在百分之六十左右。又如山东省粗粮收购工作至今还没有布置到各基层点，水白九月二十日红粮收购量只占上市量百分之二十五强。还有些地区现在竟已产生了“松劲”“收兵”情绪，认为粮食收购工作已可告个段落，如湖南省醴陵县的收购办公室现只留一个人办公，其余人员全部抽回；浏阳县原设有收购委员会，现已停止办公，结果两地稻谷收购量都由过去日收三十万斤减为十万斤至二十万斤，大大影响了收购工作。
    其次是目前各经济作物已大量上市，有些合作社认为收购经济作物费力小、利润大，因而放松购粮工作。例如山东省德州专区部分合作社为了不愿收购粮食，竟采取四不收的恶劣做法：即不到时间不收；结账时不收；平日不收（集日才收）；不送到门不收，以此来限制农民出售粮食。泰安专区历城县王舍人庄，也因合作社忙于其他业务，不收农民粮食，农民不满地说：“想把小麦卖给国家，但合作社不收。”河南省长葛县合作社为了收购烟叶，撤销了四个粮食收购点，商邱县部分合作社，认为代购棉花手续费高，即决定不收购粮食，致有些初级市场的红粮、谷子无人收购。江苏宝山县合作社，也因购棉、购草席而停收稻米。此外，有些地区国营粮食部门因不大力依靠合作社收购，或因仓容不足、粮食调运和资金拨付不及时等，也形成粮食停购现象。
    由于这些地区国营粮食部门和合作社忽视广大农村初级市场的粮食收购以及放松了收购工作，给不法粮商剥削农民造成机会，如湖北省襄阳、荆州一带，普遍发现奸商乘秋收前农民急需用钱之际，压价收购青苗，有的地区一个乡即被抢购一千多亩青苗。宜昌一带不法粮商带着百货、布匹下乡，以“以货易粮”的办法进行抢购，货价比市上往往高百分之二十至三十，使农民吃亏很大。
    为了作好购粮工作，必须批判各种不正确的思想和错误的作法，并严格管理市场。必须认识到，广大农村经过土地改革后，自给自足的小农经济相对增加，市场也随着有了变化。过去由商贩集中贩运的粮食集散市场已逐渐缩小，而初级市场的粮食上市量就相对扩大。因此必须更加重视广大农村初级市场，更好地掌握粮源，满足农民售粮要求，使国家收购到更多的粮食。对收购粮食和收购经济作物及土、特产的工作，要作正确的安排，以保证顺利完成购粮工作。
