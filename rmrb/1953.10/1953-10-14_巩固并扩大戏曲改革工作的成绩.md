Consolidating and Expanding the Achievements of Opera Reform
    Ma Yanxiang

    The First National Opera Performance and Observation Conference held in Beijing in October 1952 vigorously promoted opera work across the country in various aspects. In the past, the creation and adaptation of opera scripts had long suffered from shoddy work and anti-historical tendencies, the sorting out of old repertoire lacked planning, the central opera reform policies were not earnestly implemented in many places, and crude work styles and conservative thinking were quite prevalent in reform work. After a more in-depth examination and criticism of these shortcomings at the performance conference, significant improvements were made. After the conference ended, opera actors and opera work cadres gained a great deal ideologically and artistically, and as a result, some gratifying new atmospheres quickly emerged in opera reform work throughout the country.

    First, the direction and development direction of future opera work were clarified, and the powerful realistic forces in our national opera were recognized. Opera reform should mainly promote the realistic traditions in the opera heritage, and all non-realistic tendencies that lose their original national traditions must be resolutely opposed and thoroughly corrected. In this regard, the new changes that have taken place in Cantonese opera after the national conference are particularly noteworthy. Cantonese opera was originally one of the famous opera genres in southern China, with excellent national artistic traditions and distinctive local characteristics. However, in recent decades, due to the harmful influence of imperialist and bourgeois decadent ideas, Cantonese opera has shown serious signs of degeneration. There was no major improvement after liberation. After the conference, the Cantonese opera circles in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City launched a mass study movement. During the study period, the poison that colonial comprador ideology had given to Cantonese opera for decades was revealed and criticized in a concentrated manner. There was a preliminary understanding of the gradual decline and degeneration of Cantonese opera. Many famous actors and veteran artists painfully denounced how their art suffered from the influence of imperialism and the reactionary ruling class, and they resolved to resolutely change their style and establish a new and healthy atmosphere suitable for the needs of the people. During the Spring Festival, the Cantonese opera actors who won awards at the conference also launched a "Perform Good Plays" movement, and the Cantonese opera troupes performed some new repertoires, some of which were performed dozens of times in a row. Although there are still some shortcomings in the performance of these plays, their performance attitude is serious, and the gimmicks, low tastes, and pornography often seen on the Cantonese opera stage in the past have been basically eliminated. Due to these reforms, the audience of Cantonese opera has also increased month by month.

    Secondly, through the conference, many excellent repertoires of various opera genres were exchanged, and in the past six months, the chaotic repertoire phenomenon in the past has been clarified to a large extent. In some large cities, it can be clearly seen that the stage appearance has undergone great changes, and new repertoires and relatively good traditional programs have occupied an absolute advantage. At the same time, in the past six months, Peking opera, Han opera, and Hebei Bangzi, which have a long history, have focused on sorting out traditional repertoires; Ping opera, Shanghai opera, Jianghuai opera, and Quyi opera, which have a shorter history, have focused on compiling and performing new repertoires, which is completely in line with the instructions of the Central Committee. After the conference, various opera genres exchanged and adapted some of the scripts that performed better at the conference, such as "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai", "Little Son-in-Law", "The Tale of the White Snake", "Luo Han Qian", "Visiting Turtle Mountain", "The Blue Bridge Meeting", "Broken Bridge Meeting", and "Gema", which have been performed in at least a dozen opera genres.

    Before the national conference, the central and local opera leading institutions at all levels had never seriously carried out the work of sorting out the traditional repertoires of various operas. They either adopted a laissez-faire attitude, allowing it to take its own course, or adopted a crude work style, arbitrarily changing it; the general troupes also completely lacked awareness of the importance and seriousness of the repertoires performed. Since the conference, this situation has begun to change. First of all, the state-owned opera troupes have initially corrected the blind performance state of the past without any planning.

    The national conference not only improved the political and ideological level of the artists, but also stimulated their enthusiasm for studying their profession. At the conference, they saw the excellent, exquisite, and rich expression methods of the stage art of various opera genres, and only then did they realize how small their artistic achievements were in the face of the ocean of artistic heritage, so they wanted to learn from other brother opera genres, especially from excellent performing arts. Many actors with 20 or 30 years of stage experience began to feel that acting was not easy, and the set taught by the master in the past was not enough; after watching other people's vivid performance techniques with a high degree of realism, they were not satisfied with some stereotyped performance methods. The Jin opera actors in Taiyuan City formed art research groups in each troupe in order to study how to combine the plot and perform the characters; in order to improve the artistic level of young actors, a performance and observation conference of young actors was held this spring. In order to improve the level of performing arts, the Gui opera actors specially hired some excellent veteran artists to serve as artistic consultants and teachers of the troupe, calling on young artists to learn from them and advocating hard work and package teaching and package learning. The East China Yue Opera Troupe went to the eastern Zhejiang area for a tour performance for more than a month, and also observed the performances of the Yue Opera Troupe in the countryside. It was found that the tunes of Yue opera in the countryside were much richer than those they often sang, and the rural troupes were all performed by men and women. In Jinhua, it was found that there were more than 800 kinds of tunes in Wu opera, and there were more than 100 kinds of tunes that were often sung. All these tunes were recorded by them with recording and notation, and several male actors with better acting skills were selected from the rural Yue opera troupes, and the system of men and women performing together was prepared for trial implementation. The Shanghai opera actors used to think that "Shanghai opera is the first in performing modern plays". They had no confidence in performing workers and soldiers, but they were confident in performing farmers; after watching the "Little Son-in-Law" in the Northeast, they felt that it was not easy to perform farmers, so they eagerly demanded more opportunities to experience life.

    Comrade Zhou Yang said in the summary report of the National Opera Performance and Observation Conference: "Each opera genre, as long as it is good at learning, good at absorbing the strengths of others, and courageous in improving and creating, its future will be unlimited." This call has been accepted and practiced by many opera actors.

    However, on the other hand, due to the unbalanced development of opera reform work and the misunderstanding of the spirit of the policy, some chaotic phenomena and bad tendencies have also occurred in opera work in some areas during a certain period. For example, in Shanghai's opera circles and Pingtan circles, under the guise of "national art heritage", they performed feudal and erotic programs such as "He Wenxiu", "Yang Naiwu and Little Cabbage", "Three Smiles", "Miao Jin Feng", and "Pearl Tower". Even "Exploring the Underworld Mountain," which was explicitly banned by the Central Committee, was moved out in disguise. Artists in Baotou City, Suiyuan Province, heard that the Central Committee did not allow banned plays, and thought that they could perform any play in the future. Therefore, plays such as "Fox Fate", "Five Rats Make Trouble in Tokyo", "Yellow River Formation", and "Ten Thousand Immortals Formation", which were full of cause and effect retribution, gods and ghosts superstitions, were performed. In terms of performance, the tendency of formalism also once raised its head, mainly manifested in the stage design and costume design. When a theater troupe in Xi'an City performed "The Tale of the White Snake", they moved a real boat shape to the stage; in the scene of "Drinking Wine", not only did a real snake shape appear, but also two light bulbs were installed in the snake's eyes, which were brightly lit and creepy. When a Qinqiang troupe in Baotou City performed "The Tale of the White Snake" in the scene of Xu Xian opening a pharmacy, there was a meat shop on the right side of the stage, with a fat pig hanging high and a butcher selling meat; on the left was Xu Xian's small pharmacy that could only accommodate two people. When some troupes performed "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl", many small light bulbs were installed on the lotus pond and on the Queen Mother's flat crown, flashing on and off with the singing. Even the usually more simple Jin opera troupe in Taiyuan City was infected with this trend. When performing "Acacia Tree", the stage was full of scenery, which greatly restricted the actors from doing their body movements and walking on the stage.

    The above is just a brief example. The leading organs in some places have attracted attention after repeated criticisms from newspapers and audiences, and have begun to stop the continued development of this bad tendency; however, some opera cadres in some places have adopted an attitude of indifference even after discovering these phenomena, because they are afraid of being criticized "roughly". This attitude is completely wrong. Whether opera reform work can be done well depends mainly on the ideological and artistic leadership of the opera cause. Letting it go is actually giving up leadership, which is to cancel opera reform work. The problem is that cadres must overcome all bureaucratic, commandist, and undemocratic work styles towards artists, and cooperate closely with them on the basis of unity and mutual respect, and any problems can be solved. We sincerely hope that the Chinese Dramatists Association can promote opera reform work in the following aspects in the future.

    1. Organize opera creation, sort out traditional repertoires, and strive to gradually accumulate a set of relatively excellent preserved repertoires.

    At present, there are about 2,000 state-owned and private opera troupes in the country, about 200,000 opera artists, and nearly one million viewers nationwide every day. Just looking at these figures, one can imagine how important opera occupies in people's lives. Therefore, in addition to vigorously organizing opera writers to create new scripts, it is also necessary to organize opera writers and opera artists to cooperate, and carry out the sorting out and adaptation of traditional repertoires of various opera genres in a planned and step-by-step manner, so as to ensure the ideological and artistic quality of the performances and ensure that opera art plays its role in educating the people and enriching the people's spiritual life. During the National Conference, 32 kinds of excellent local opera scripts were reviewed, printed and published. These scripts have been promoted nationwide and have played a role. This year, the Chinese Academy of Opera, with the specific assistance of the Art Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, has carried out the sorting out of popular Peking opera repertoires, and 60 kinds of scripts will be gradually printed within the year. At present, major administrative regions and provinces and cities with conditions have established certain institutions and are beginning to carry out the unified and centralized sorting out of various local repertoires in a planned manner. It is hoped that the Drama Association can vigorously assist and support this work, and organize writers to create excellent new opera scripts, and take improving the quality of national opera repertoires and improving the ideological level of opera as one of its important tasks in the future, so that our opera can truly become an important weapon for educating the broad masses of the people with patriotic spirit and democratic spirit.

    2. Carry out research and reform on opera music, art, and performing arts, and promote the director system to promote the further improvement of opera stage art.

    The vast majority of our operas are created by the people or the people's writers and artists, so it contains a great degree of popularity, and it also has a realistic basis; even in performing arts, it is no exception. Although opera actors have never boasted that the creation method of their performing arts is realistic, from their creative attitude, it should be admitted that it basically meets the requirements of realism. Whether it is Peking opera or local opera, all excellent performances are almost artistic creations based on the plot, the character's personality, thoughts and feelings. From the perspective of opera stage movements, its characteristic is the dancing of movements, and this dancing movement is also formed by refining, concentrating and exaggerating the movements in real life. It should be the common and serious task of dramatists in the future to analyze and study the complex and intertwined realistic and formalistic factors in opera performing arts with scientific viewpoints and methods, promote the realistic part of it, and abandon the formalistic part of it.

    The director system has almost become an important key to the success or failure of drama performances. In our opera circles, Yue opera has cooperated with film and drama workers and implemented the director system as early as during the War of Resistance Against Japan, boldly absorbing the advantages of various sister arts and the achievements of modern stage technology, so that its stage art has developed rapidly and become a relatively complete comprehensive art. The director is not only responsible for solving many technical problems from the text to the stage image of a script, but also needs to be responsible for how to express the theme appropriately and convey the ideological content of the entire script. At present, the director system has begun to be established in some state-owned opera troupes, but the vast majority of troupes still lack this system; there are still some difficulties in implementing such a system, mainly because there is still a lack of sufficient understanding of the director's work. Secondly, there are not many talents who are competent for the work of opera directors at present. General drama or opera directors have considerable experience in how to handle scripts and characters, but they are not familiar enough with the laws of opera stage technology. To solve this difficulty, at the current stage, we can only hope that experienced drama or opera directors will join the opera troupes, learn from the actors, and rely on their joint cooperation.

    In the work of directors, the stage design of opera is a problem that is often discussed but has never been resolved reasonably. Some people think that the fact that stage devices were not used on the opera stage in the past is completely a primitive, backward, and low-level art form; others think that the art form of opera has reached a high degree of integrity, and if new stage devices are added, it will destroy the integrity of the opera form, and therefore criticize the attempt of stage devices as the Shanghai style. I think both of these views are not comprehensive enough, and therefore not completely correct. We should not oppose the use of new stage devices in the performance of new opera, but we must consider that the characteristics of Chinese opera lie in the high concentration and high refinement of performing arts. The development of the plot and the character's personality are entirely transmitted by the actor's creation in action images and the free control of space; the center of the performance lies in the actor. Inappropriate backgrounds and props will destroy the actor's image effect. As for what kind of style the opera stage device should adopt, how to make the device design play a certain role and function organically in the performance, and how to solve the contradictions with the traditional expression methods of opera due to the use of the device, etc., these are all important issues related to the improvement of opera art. These issues need to be organized, discussed and researched in a led and planned manner, so that they can be gradually resolved in continuous practice.

    Regarding music, generally speaking, the expressiveness of our opera music is quite poor. It seems that it is difficult for any opera genre to express more complex emotions, especially some young opera genres, such as Shanghai opera, Yue opera, Ping opera, etc., which lack changes in tunes. Yue opera is mainly based on singing, and its singing only has two sentences up and down, at most four sentences of "beginning, carrying, turning and combining". Although other tunes have also been adopted recently, they are still monotonous. Secondly, Chinese opera music in general is still based on the life rhythm and mode of agricultural society, so it seems to be more suitable for expressing the life emotions of feudal society. It often feels out of place to express the life and emotions of the masses of the people today. Also, due to the long-term oppressed and miserable situation of the working people in the past, their songs are generally tragic and sad, and there are fewer tunes that express some happy, excited, and happy emotions. These shortcomings need to be studied and improved by experts.

    3. Regularly organize opera cadres and actors to study Marxism-Leninism and Marxist-Leninist art theory, and use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to assist the government in promoting opera reform work.

    Opera reform is a delicate ideological work, a long-term ideological struggle, a struggle between the new and the old, a struggle between progress and conservatism, and a struggle between prudence and rudeness. Therefore, our opera cadres and actors must be required to arm our minds with Marxist-Leninist thought. Only by firmly grasping the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism can we correctly carry out ideological struggle. In order to make our cause advance, in order to make our opera art more pure and healthy, and in order to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, we must often launch correct criticism and self-criticism. We must launch serious criticism of the rude work style, conservative thinking, certain phenomena of misinterpreting the opera reform policy, and the phenomena of artistic corruption and degeneration in opera reform. The ranks of the opera circles are so large, its connection with the broad masses of the people is so close, and it itself has some long-standing backwardness. Whether from the interests of the people or from the development prospects of the opera cause, doing so is completely necessary and has positive significance. The Chinese Dramatists Association will take this important work as one of its central tasks in the future. We hope that all opera workers will unite as one and actively respond to this call, break the unhealthy atmosphere in the opera circles in the past that did not criticize, were afraid of criticism, and dealt with criticism with a perfunctory attitude. We hope that opera actors can often conduct criticism and self-criticism with a heartfelt and happy mood, and we also hope that opera work cadres can often check their work with a modest and serious attitude in order to overcome the errors and shortcomings in our work.

    巩固并扩大戏曲改革工作的成绩
    马彦祥
    一九五二年十月在北京举行的第一届全国戏曲观摩演出大会对全国戏曲工作在各方面作了有力的推动。过去戏曲剧本的创作与改编方面长期存在着粗制滥造与反历史倾向，整理旧有剧目一向缺乏计划性，中央戏曲改革政策在很多地方没有认真执行，改革工作中的粗暴作风与保守思想相当普遍地存在着。这种种缺点在演出大会中作了比较深入的检查和批评之后，有了显著的改进。会演结束以后，戏曲演员和戏曲工作干部在思想上、艺术上都有了很大的收获，因而很快地在全国各地的戏曲改革工作中出现了一些可喜的新气象。
    首先是明确了今后戏曲工作的方针和发展方向，认识到我们的民族戏曲中的强大的现实主义的力量，戏曲改革主要应该是发扬戏曲遗产中的现实主义传统，一切丧失自己原有的民族传统的非现实主义倾向必须坚决反对，彻底纠正。在这方面，粤剧在全国会演后所发生的新的变化，是特别值得注意的。粤剧原是我国南方的著名剧种之一，具有优秀的民族艺术传统和鲜明的地方色彩。但在这几十年来，由于受到帝国主义、资产阶级腐朽思想的有害影响，粤剧表现了严重的堕落倾向。解放后也没有大的改进。会演后，广东省和广州市粤剧界展开了群众性的学习运动，在学习期间，集中地揭露了和批判了几十年来殖民地买办思想给予粤剧的毒害，对于粤剧日趋退化堕落有了初步的认识，许多名演员和老艺人都沉痛地控诉了自己的艺术如何遭受帝国主义、反动统治阶级的影响的毒害，今后要坚决改变作风，树立一种适合人民需要的新的健康的风气。春节期间，在会演中获奖的粤剧演员又发起了一个“演好戏”运动，各粤剧团演出了一些新剧目，有的剧目连续演出几十场。在这些戏的演出中，虽然还存在着若干缺点，但他们的演出态度是严肃了，过去粤剧舞台上经常看到的那些噱头、低级趣味以及色情的东西，基本上被肃清了。由于这些改革，粤剧的观众也逐月增加了。
    其次，经过会演，各剧种的许多优良剧目互相交流，这半年多来，在很大程度上澄清了过去的剧目混乱现象。在一些大城市中，很显著地可以看出舞台面目有了大的变化，新剧目和比较优良的传统节目已占了绝对的优势。同时，半年来，京剧、汉剧、河北梆子等历史较久的剧种着重整理传统剧目；评剧、沪剧、江淮剧、曲艺剧等历史较短的剧种是着重于编演新的剧目，这是完全符合于中央的指示的。各个剧种在会演以后，互相交流改编了一些在会演中表现得比较好的剧本，如“梁山伯与祝英台”、“小女婿”、“白蛇传”、“罗汉钱”、
    “游龟山”、“蓝桥会”、“断桥会”、“葛麻”等，至少都有十多个剧种的演出。
    在全国会演以前，中央以至地方的各级戏曲领导机构对于各种戏曲的传统剧目的整理工作，一向未曾认真进行，不是采取放任的态度，听其自流，就是采取粗暴的作风，肆意乱改；一般剧团对于上演剧目的重要性与严肃性也是完全缺乏认识的。从会演后，这种情况开始有了改变。首先在国营戏曲剧团中初步纠正了以往漫无计划的盲目性的演出状态。
    全国会演不但提高了艺人们的政治思想水平，而且激发了他们钻研业务的热情。他们在会演中看见各剧种舞台艺术的优秀的、精湛的、丰富的表现方法，才发现面对着艺术遗产的海洋，自己的艺术成就是多么微小，因而要向其他兄弟剧种学习，特别是要向优秀的表演艺术学习。许多有着二、三十年舞台经验的演员开始觉得演戏的不容易，只靠过去师傅所教的一套已经不够了；看了别人的具有高度现实性的生动的表演技术，对某些刻板化的表演方法连自己也不满足了。太原市的晋剧演员们为了研究如何结合剧情，表演角色，每个剧团里都成立了艺术研究组；为了提高青年演员的艺术水平，今年春天特别举行了一次青年演员的观摩会演。桂剧演员们为了提高表演艺术的水平，特地聘请了一些优秀的老艺人充当剧团的艺术顾问和教师，号召年青艺人向他们学习，提倡苦学苦练和包教包学。华东越剧团曾到浙东一带去做了一个多月的巡回演出，同时也观摩了农村中越剧团的演出。发现在农村中越剧的曲调要比她们经常所唱的丰富得多，而且农村剧团中都是男女合演的。在金华，发现婺剧的曲调有八百多种，常唱的就有百余种。所有这些曲调，她们都用录音和记谱记录了下来，又在农村越剧团中选拔了若干演技较好的男演员，准备试行男女合演的制度。沪剧的演员们过去一直认为“演现代戏，沪剧第一”，演工人、士兵无把握，演农民是有把握的；在看了东北的“小女婿”后，才感到就是演农民也是不容易的，因而迫切地要求能有更多的机会去体验生活。
    周扬同志在全国戏曲观摩演出大会的总结报告中说：“各个剧种，凡是善于学习，善于吸收别人的长处，勇于改进和创造的，它的前途就会是无限的”。这个号召已被许多戏曲演员所接受，所实践。
    但是在另一方面，由于戏曲改革工作发展的不平衡状态，以及对政策精神的误解，因而在一个时期内，某些地区的戏曲工作也产生了一些混乱现象和不良倾向。例如上海的戏曲界、评弹界借着“民族艺术遗产”的幌子，又演起封建色情的节目如“何文秀”、“杨乃武与小白菜”、“三笑”、“描金凤”、“珍珠塔”来，甚至中央所明令禁演的“探阴山”都改头换面一齐搬了出来；绥远省包头市艺人听说中央不让禁戏，认为今后就什么戏都能上演，于是像“狐狸缘”、“五鼠闹东京”、“黄河阵”、“万仙阵”等充满了因果报应、神鬼迷信的戏都演出了。在演出方面，形式主义的倾向也曾经抬头，主要表现在舞台装置和服装的设计上。西安市某剧社演出“白蛇传”时，将真的船形搬上了舞台；“饮酒”一场，不但出现了真的蛇形，而且在蛇的眼睛里还装了两只电灯泡，亮晃晃地令人毛骨悚然。包头市的一个秦腔剧团在表演“白蛇传”许仙开药铺一场，舞台上右边一家肉铺，高挂着一口肥猪，一个屠户在卖肉；左边是许仙的只容两人入坐的小药铺。有的剧团在演“牛郎织女”时，莲花池上以及王母平天冠上都安了许多小电灯泡，随着唱腔忽明忽灭。连一向比较朴实的太原市的晋剧团，也沾染了这种风气，演“相思树”时，满台布景，使得演员连做身段走台步都受了很大的限制。
    以上所述，不过略举一二，有些地方的领导机关在经过报纸和观众一再批评之后，已引起注意，并已在着手制止这种不良倾向的继续发展；但也有些地方的戏曲干部虽经发现了这些现象，因怕遭受
    “粗暴”的批评，却采取了熟视无睹的态度。这种态度是完全错误的。戏曲改革工作能否做好，主要在于对戏曲事业的思想和艺术的领导，放任不管实际上就是放弃领导，也就是取消戏曲改革工作。问题是在干部必须克服对艺人的一切官僚主义、命令主义以及不民主的作风，在团结和相互尊重的基础上，与他们亲密合作，任何问题是都能解决的。我们十分殷切地期望着中国戏剧家协会今后能够在下列几方面来推进戏曲改革工作。
    一、组织戏曲创作，整理传统剧目，争取能逐渐积累出一套比较优秀的保留剧目。
    目前，全国有国营的和私营的戏曲剧团约在二千个左右，戏曲艺人约计二十万人，全国每日观众近百万人。单看这些数字，就可想见戏曲在人民生活中占着何等重要的地位。因此，除大力组织戏曲作家创作新的剧本外，更需要组织戏曲作家与戏曲艺人合作，有计划、有步骤地进行各个剧种传统剧目的整理和改编工作，以保证演出的思想和艺术的质量，保证戏曲艺术发挥它教育人民、丰富人民精神生活的作用。全国会演期间，曾经审定刊印了地方戏曲的优良剧本三十二种，这些剧本已在全国推行，发生了作用。今年中国戏曲研究院在中央文化部艺术事业管理局的具体协助下，进行了京剧流行剧目的整理工作，年内将有六十种剧本陆续付印。现在各大行政区及有条件的各省、市大都已成立了一定机构，正在开始有计划地进行各种地方剧目的统一集中的整理工作。希望剧协能大力协助并支持这一工作，并组织作家创作优良的新戏曲剧本，把提高全国戏曲剧目的质量，提高戏曲思想水平作为它今后的重要任务之一，使我们的戏曲真正能成为以爱国精神与民主精神教育广大人民的重要武器。
    二、进行戏曲音乐、美术和表演艺术的研究和改革，推行导演制度，以促进戏曲舞台艺术进一步的提高。
    我们的戏曲绝大部分都是人民或人民的作家和艺术家所创造的，因此它就包含有很大程度的人民性，也就有了现实主义的基础；即在表演艺术上亦不例外。戏曲演员虽向来不夸耀他们的表演艺术的创作方法是现实主义的，但从他们的创作态度来说，应该承认是基本上合乎现实主义的要求的。无论京剧或地方剧，凡是优越的表演几乎无一不是根据剧情、根据人物的性格、思想和感情来进行艺术创造的。从戏曲的舞台动作来看，其特点是动作的舞蹈化，而这种舞蹈化的动作也无一不是根据现实生活中的动作加以洗练、集中和夸张而形成的。将戏曲表演艺术中错综复杂地纠缠在一起的现实主义和形式主义的因素，以科学的观点和方法加以分析研究，发扬其中现实主义的部分，抛弃其中形式主义的部分，应该是今后戏剧艺术家们共同的严重任务。
    导演制度几乎已成为戏剧演出的成功与否的重要关键。在我们戏曲界中，越剧由于早在抗战期间就与电影话剧工作者合作，实行了导演制度，大胆地吸收了各种姊妹艺术的长处和近代舞台技术的成就，因而使它的舞台艺术突飞猛进，成为比较完整的综合艺术。导演不仅要负责解决一个剧本从文字到舞台形象的许多技巧问题，更需要对如何以适当的技术表现主题，传达整个剧本的思想内容负责。目前，在一些国营戏曲剧团中已开始建立了导演制度，但绝大多数的剧团还缺乏这一制度；要实行这样的制度也还存在着一些困难，主要是对于导演工作还缺少足够的认识。其次，是足以胜任戏曲导演工作的人才，在目前也还不是很多。一般的话剧或歌剧导演，他们对于如何处理剧本和人物有相当经验，但对于戏曲舞台技术的规律又不够熟悉。要解决这困难，在目前的阶段，只有希望有经验的话剧或歌剧导演参加戏曲剧团，向演员们学习，依靠他们共同合作。
    在导演工作中，经常在讨论而始终没有得到合理解决的是戏曲的舞台装置问题。有人以为过去戏曲舞台上不用舞台装置完全是一种原始的、落后的，低级的艺术形式；也有人以为戏曲的艺术形式已经达到高度的完整，如果加用新的舞台装置就会破坏戏曲形式的完整性，因而斥责舞台装置的尝试为海派作风。我想这两种看法都是不够全面的，因而也都不完全正确。我们不应该反对新戏曲的演出中运用新的舞台装置，但必须考虑到中国戏曲的特点在于表演技术的高度集中与高度洗练，剧情发展和人物性格是全仗着演员在动作形象上的创造和空间的自由控制来传达的；演出的中心在于演员。不适当的背景和道具会破坏演员的形象效果。至于戏曲舞台装置究竟应该采取那一种风格，如何使装置设计在演出中能有机地发挥其一定的作用与功能，以及如何来解决由于运用装置而产生的与戏曲传统的表现方法相矛盾的困难等等，都是关系戏曲艺术提高的重要问题，这些问题都有待于有领导、有计划地来组织讨论和研究，使其在不断的实践中逐步获得解决。
    关于音乐，一般说来，我们的戏曲音乐的表现力是相当贫乏的，任何剧种似乎都难于表现比较复杂的情绪，尤其是一些年青的剧种，如沪剧、越剧、评剧等曲调更是缺少变化。越剧是以唱为主的，而其唱腔只有上下两句，至多是“起承转合”四句，近来虽然也采取其他曲调，但仍嫌单调。其次，中国的戏曲音乐一般地说还是根据农业社会的生活节奏和方式制成的，因此它似乎更适宜于表现封建社会的生活情绪，要它表现今天人民大众的生活和情绪，便往往觉得格格不入。又由于过去劳动人民长期地处于被压迫的悲惨境遇，因此他们的歌声一般地是悲壮、哀怨的多，表现欢乐、兴奋、愉快一些情绪的曲调就比较少。这些缺点都是需要专家们来予以研究和改进的。
    三、经常组织戏曲干部和演员学习马克思列宁主义及马克思列宁主义的艺术理论，运用批评与自我批评的武器，借以协助政府推行戏曲改革工作。
    戏曲改革是一种细致的思想工作，是一种较长期的思想斗争工作，是新与旧的斗争，是进步与保守的斗争，是慎重与粗暴的斗争。因此，就必须要求我们的戏曲干部和演员们以马克思列宁主义的思想来武装我们的头脑，惟有紧紧地掌握马克思列宁主义的思想武器，我们才能够正确地进行思想斗争。为了使我们的事业前进，为了使我们的戏曲艺术日见纯洁健康，为了坚决地贯彻毛主席的文艺路线，我们必须经常展开正确的批评与自我批评。对戏曲改革中的粗暴作风、保守思想，某些曲解戏曲改革政策的现象，以及艺术上的腐化堕落的现象，必须展开严肃的批评。戏曲界的队伍如此庞大，它与广大人民的联系是如此密切，而它本身又具有若干由来已久的落后性，无论从人民的利益上说，从戏曲事业的发展前途上说，这样做都是完全必要的，具有积极意义的。中国戏剧家协会将以这一重要工作做为它今后的中心任务之一，我们希望全体戏曲工作者大家一致团结，积极地响应这一号召，打破戏曲界过去的那种不批评、怕批评、以敷衍塞责的态度来应付批评的不健康的空气，希望戏曲演员们能够以衷心愉快的心情来经常进行批评与自我批评，也希望戏曲工作干部同志能够以虚心严肃的态度来经常检查自己的工作，以克服我们工作中的错误和缺点。
