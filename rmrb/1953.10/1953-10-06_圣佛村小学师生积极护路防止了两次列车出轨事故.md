    St. Buddha Village Elementary School Teachers and Students Actively Protect the Railway, Preventing Two Train Derailment Accidents
    Ren Duqing and Zhang Hong of the Cultural Center of Huo County, Shanxi Province, wrote: St. Buddha Village Elementary School in our county is located near the Tongpu Railway. The elementary school students love and protect the people's railway very much. They often promote the significance of railway protection to the masses and have collected many iron connectors, rail spikes, and other equipment, which they handed over to the railway public security department. Therefore, the Linfen Public Security Railway Section awarded the school a silk banner. On the morning of January 9th this year, when five Young Pioneers of the school, including Sun Xiaogen and Xing Yinhai, passed the railway on their way to school, they discovered that one section of the left rail was cracked, and one end of the cracked rail was warped. They rushed back to the school to report it. The teacher immediately took a megaphone and led the students to the broken rail to stand guard, and at the same time sent students to report to the Huo County Railway Station. Just then, a train was heading north, and the teachers and students guarding the railway stopped it, thus preventing an accident. Afterwards, the Taiyuan Railway Administration and the Huo County Bureau of Culture and Education held a mass award ceremony at the school on March 21st, awarding the school prizes and a silk banner. At 4:00 p.m. on August 24th, four Young Pioneers of the school, including Sun Quanshun and Cheng Jisuo, were walking home along the railway from the school when they discovered that another section of the right rail was cracked. One of them stayed to guard the spot, and the other three rushed to report to the school and the railway station, enabling passenger train No. 317 to stop safely, preventing an accident. The behavior of the teachers and students of the school in cherishing the people's railway is worthy of praise.

    圣佛村小学师生积极护路防止了两次列车出轨事故
    山西省霍县文化馆任笃庆、张宏等来信：我县圣佛村小学靠近同蒲铁路。该校小学生们很爱护人民的铁路。他们经常向群众宣传护路意义，并搜集了很多铁碰头、道钉等器材送交铁路公安部门。因此，临公铁路段曾奖给该校锦旗一面。今年一月九日上午，该校少年先锋队员孙小根、邢银海等五人上学时经过铁路，发现铁路上有一处左轨裂断，裂轨一头已翘起。他们就急忙跑到校内报告。该校教师马上拿上广播筒带了学生奔赴断轨处看守，同时派学生到霍县车站报告。当时刚刚有一次列车往北开来，经看守铁路的师生们阻止，终于没有出事故。事后太原铁路管理局、霍县文教科于三月二十一日在该校召开了一个群众性的发奖大会，奖给该校奖品和锦旗。八月二十四日下午四时，该校少年先锋队员孙全顺、程记锁等四人自校中沿着铁路回家，发现铁路又有一处右轨裂断。他们一人留守该处，三人奔向学校、车站报告，使三百十七次客车安全停车，没出事故。该校师生这种爱护人民铁路的行为是值得表扬的。
