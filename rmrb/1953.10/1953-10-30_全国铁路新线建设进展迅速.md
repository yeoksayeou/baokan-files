    National railway new line construction is progressing actively. The national investment in railway construction this year is much greater than in any year in Chinese history. The design task is 136 percent more than the amount of work completed last year, earthwork is 106 percent more, tunnels are 137 percent more, large and medium-sized bridges are 219 percent more, and the mileage of track laid is 26 percent more. By the end of September this year, the new line projects that started construction had completed 65 percent of the annual engineering tasks, and 75 percent of the track laying tasks. Currently, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has been laid from Lanzhou to below the Wushaoling Mountains, the train from Chengdu to Mianyang on the Tiancheng Railway can run directly, and the forest railway between Kuduer and Tulihe has also been completed.

    The pioneers of new line construction – the surveying and design personnel – have left their footprints everywhere, from the Changbai Mountains covered with snow all year round to the southern land that is like summer all year round, from the northwest plateau to the coast of the East China Sea. They used吊绳 (diao sheng - rope) to cross the high mountains of Yunnan and Guizhou, and used horse troughs to cross the rushing Niao River. On the grasslands, in uninhabited places, they pitched tents and found cow dung to make fires on the white snow. In the desert areas where they could not find water to drink, they blew away the floating oil from the water tanks of their cars and drank it. In this way, the staff of eighteen surveying and design general teams have carried out surveying work on more than ten new lines.

    The work efficiency and technical level of many designers have been improved under the guidance of Soviet experts. According to statistics from the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, in the first half of this year, due to the efforts of the designers, the advancement and rationality of the designs, a total of more than 260 billion yuan of project costs can be saved. In the past six months, the surveying and design personnel of the Southwest and other three design branches have put forward more than 1,000 rationalization proposals, of which 70 percent have been adopted. Engineer Feng Shicheng of the Design Bureau improved the design of buried bridge abutments, which can save 40 million yuan for one abutment.

    Workers, engineering technicians, and management personnel of the construction units, fearing no difficulties, are fighting on the new line construction posts. In the forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains, the workers who built the Kutudor section created methods and tools such as ice-buried bridge piles and snow sledges, learned from the Soviet experience in building roads in cold regions, and overcame the severe cold of minus 48 degrees Celsius. On the Tiancheng Railway, the road builders overcame the summer floods, pouring concrete into the Fu River Bridge in the water, and building a dam at the Huilongsi construction site, continuing construction as usual. In the Fengsha section, tunnels followed one after another, and the workers drilled into the "belly of the mountain", overcoming collapses and stubborn rocks, and creating one shortcut after another. The road builders in other regions also overcame the force six and seven winds and the heat of more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit, advancing rapidly.

    Now, the new line employees are enthusiastically carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. In Wushaoling, 30,000 labor troops are building roads on this high mountain where it snows in June and the air is thin. This is the largest project in the history of national railways. If the earth and stone excavated from this 60-kilometer-long main line subgrade were made into an earth embankment one meter high and three meters wide, a roadbed of more than 2,200 kilometers could be built, equivalent to from Wushaoling to Beijing. The workers' slogan is: "Drill through the Wushaoling Mountains, cross the Gobi Desert, build the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, and develop the resources of the Northwest."

    全国铁路新线建设进展迅速
    我国铁路新线建设正在积极进行。今年国家对铁路建设的投资，比中国历史上任何一年都要多得多。设计任务比去年完成的工作量多百分之一百三十六，土石方工程比去年多百分之一百零六，隧道多百分之一百三十七，大、中桥梁多百分之二百一十九，铺轨里程多百分之二十六。今年开工建设的新线工程到九月底为止，全年工程任务已经完成了百分之六十五，铺轨任务已经完成了百分之七十五。现在，兰新路已经从兰州铺到乌鞘岭下，天成路成都到绵阳的火车已经可以直开，库都尔、图里河间的森林铁路也修通了。
    新线建设的开路先锋队——勘测设计人员，从终年积雪的长白山区到长年如夏的南部国土，从西北高原到东海之滨，到处都有他们的足迹。他们借着吊绳翻过云贵高山，用马槽渡过奔腾的泥鳅河。在草滩上，没有人烟的地方，他们张开帐幕，在白皑皑的雪地上找牛粪来生火。在沙漠地带找不到水喝，他们就把汽车水箱里的水，吹去浮油，喝了下去。就这样，十八个勘测设计总队的职工现已进行了十余条新线的测量工作。
    许多设计人员在苏联专家指导下，工作效率和技术水平已有提高。据铁道部设计局统计，今年上半年，由于设计人员的努力，设计的先进与合理，共可节省工程费二千六百多亿元。西南等三个设计分局的勘测设计人员，半年来提出一千多件合理化建议，其中百分之七十已被采用，设计局工程师冯式枨改善埋式桥台设计的建议，一个桥台就可节省四千万元。
    施工单位的工人、工程技术人员和管理人员，不怕任何困难，战斗在新线建设的岗位上。在大兴安岭森林里，修筑库图段的职工创造了冰上埋桥桩、雪爬犁等方法和工具，学习了苏联寒带筑路经验，战胜了零下四十八度的严寒。在天成路，筑路工人战胜了夏季的洪水，他们在水中浇灌了涪江桥的混凝土，他们在回龙寺工地上筑起了大堤，照常施工。在丰沙段，隧道一个接着一个，工人们钻到“山肚子”里，战胜了坍方和顽石，打出了一条一条的捷径。其他地区的筑路工人们，也都战胜了六、七级大风，和华氏一百多度的炎热，迅速前进。
    现在，新线职工正热烈开展增产节约竞赛。在乌鞘岭，三万劳动大军，正在这座六月降雪、空气稀薄的高山上修路。这是全国铁路历史上最大的工程。如果把这段长六十公里的正线路基所挖出来的土石方做成一公尺高、三公尺宽的土堤，就可以筑成路基两千二百多公里，相当于从乌鞘岭到北京。工人们的口号是：“凿穿乌鞘岭，跨过戈壁滩，修通兰新路，开发西北的资源”。
