Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Dispatch: To greet the 36th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, the socialist emulation drive continues to unfold extensively in various industrial, transportation, and other enterprise sectors of the Soviet Union. Good news from the production front is constantly pouring in from various regions.

    The entire staff of the Midlena Station in Dnepropetrovsk put forward valuable suggestions for strengthening freight turnover in the competition to welcome the festival. This station specializes in transporting minerals from the Dzerzhinsky Mine to supply the Zaporozhye Steel Plant and the Azov Steel Plant. Railway workers suggested using rapid loading and unloading, transporting minerals on fixed direct lines, and having fixed crews and locomotive groups deliver them to factories according to a certain timetable. With the cooperation of the miners, the railway employees at this station found ways to shorten loading and transit times. They unified the organization of motor vehicles at both the station and the mine, and assembled trains at the loading point, while assembling vehicles on both sides. The miners also strengthened the mechanization of loading work. As a result, since September 20, each loading time has been shortened by two and a half hours compared to the regulations, shortening the dwell time of the carriages and strengthening the transportation of minerals. The initiative of this station has been echoed by railway workers at the Dolgintsevo, Zaporozhye, and Volnovakha stations.

    All the workers of the Ural Electrical Equipment Factory in Sverdlovsk, participating in the production competition to welcome the October Festival, are working hard to victoriously complete agricultural orders. The factory has already built two hydroelectric generators with a generating capacity of 750 kilowatts each for the Kiev Hydropower Station. Now, the workers in the large machine workshop are launching a competition to complete the generators ordered by the collective farm hydropower stations in the Kyrgyz and Uzbek Republics and the Krasnodar Territory ahead of schedule. A group of designers at the factory has designed new types of generators for rural hydropower stations.

    The working people of other parts of the Soviet Union have also achieved great successes in the production competition. The workers of the "Black Mountain" mine in the Kuznetsk coal region completed their October plan on October 9. They guarantee to overfulfill the October plan by 45,000 tons of coal, and save an extra 100,000 rubles. All the employees of the Leningrad Machine Factory under the Ministry of Petroleum Industry were producing products for the late October plan as early as the 9th. The workers of the Grozny Oil Trust have completed the October drilling task. The drilling workers of the drilling team participating in the competition have victoriously completed the annual task on October 8. By reducing the cost of drilling work, they have saved 3,334,000 rubles this year. In the first nine months of this year, the total turbine drilling volume of the entire trust has increased to four times that of the same period last year.

    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Moscow News: Soviet agricultural workers are launching a socialist emulation drive in the vast fields for various autumn field work to welcome the 36th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution.

    The Central Asian and Southern Caucasus Republics are in the season of cotton picking. Cotton growers have completed the September cotton picking task. By October 1, they had sold 542,900 tons more cotton to the state than in the same period last year. At present, many advanced state farms and collective farms are launching a competition to welcome the festival, guaranteeing to complete the annual plan for selling cotton before the October Revolution Festival. Many new production indicators have been created in the competition. In the Uzbek Republic, Mirzabayev, a cotton picking machine operator at the "Naren" State Farm in Namangan Oblast, picks at least 1,500 to 1,600 kilograms of cotton from each hectare (equivalent to 15 mu) of cotton field. Many cotton picking machine operators in Tashkent Oblast and Kashkadarya Oblast pick three to four tons of cotton per day. The cotton growers in the Kamashi District of Kashkadarya Oblast were the first to complete the annual plan for selling cotton to the state. This year they delivered a total of 700 tons more high-quality cotton than last year. In the Kyrgyz Republic, many cotton picking machine operators have reached a level of picking more than four tons of cotton per day.

    In terms of harvesting other crops and autumn plowing, the collective farmers and agricultural machine operators of the Khislavichi District in the Smolensk Oblast of the Russian Federation recently launched a festival competition to all agricultural workers in the state, striving to successfully complete this year's various agricultural tasks. They guarantee: to harvest grains and perennial herbage before recently; to sell flax products to purchasing stations by the end of October; and to plow autumn tillage land in early October. This call has been responded to by agricultural workers in many districts of the state. In the competition, the members of the "Kirov", "Free Labor", "Memorial Ilyich", "New Life" and other collective farms have successfully completed or are about to complete their competition plans.

    The "Kirov" collective farm has harvested grain, flax and pasture, without losing a single grain of grain and other crop seeds.

    迎接十月社会主义革命三十六周年
    苏联工农业劳动者广泛展开竞赛
    据新华社莫斯科电：迎接十月社会主义革命三十六周年的节日竞赛，继续在苏联各工业、交通运输等企业部门广泛展开。各地纷纷传来生产战线上的捷报。
    第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克的米德列纳车站的全体工作人员，在迎接节日的竞赛中提出了加强货物流转的宝贵建议。这个车站专门运送捷尔任斯基矿局的矿产，以供应萨坡罗什炼钢厂和亚速钢铁工厂。铁路工人建议用快速装卸，在固定的直达线上运输矿产，并且由固定的乘务和机务组按一定的行车表运达工厂。在矿工们的合作下，这个车站的铁路员工找到了缩短装运和运转时间的方法。他们把车站和矿山两处的机动车辆都统一组织起来，并在装运点就把列车编组，同时在两方面编组车辆。矿山工人也加强了装载工作的机械化。这样，从九月二十日起，每次装载时间都比规定的提早了两小时半，缩短了车厢的停歇时间，并加强了矿产的运送。这个车站的倡议得到了多尔金切沃、萨坡罗什、沃尔诺瓦哈等车站的铁路工人的响应。
    参加迎接十月节生产竞赛的斯维德洛夫斯克乌拉尔电器设备工厂全体工人，正在为胜利地完成农业定货而进行的紧张工作。该厂已为基辅的水电站造好了两台发电能力各为七百五十瓩的水力发电机。现在，大机器车间的工人正在展开竞赛，争取提前完成吉尔吉斯、乌兹别克共和国和克拉斯诺达边疆区的集体农庄水电站订造的发电机。工厂的一批设计师已为农村水电站设计了新式的发电机。
    苏联其他各地的劳动人民也在生产竞赛中获得了巨大的成就。库兹涅茨克煤区“黑山”矿坑的工人们，在十月九日就完成了十月份的计划。他们保证要在十月份超计划多采四万五千吨煤，额外节约十万卢布。石油工业部所属列宁格勒机器工厂的全体职工，在九日就生产着十月下旬的计划产品。格罗兹尼石油托辣斯的工人已完成了十月份的钻井任务。参加竞赛的钻井处的钻井工人已在十月八日胜利地完成了一年的任务。由于减低钻井工作的成本，他们今年节约了三百三十三万四千卢布。在今年头九个月中，全托辣斯的透平钻井量已增为去年同期的四倍。
    据新华社讯：莫斯科消息：苏联农业劳动者正在辽阔广大的田野上，展开各种秋季田间工作的社会主义竞赛，以迎接十月社会主义革命三十六周年。
    中亚细亚和南高加索各加盟共和国正逢收摘棉花的季节。植棉者已经完成了九月份的摘棉任务。到十月一日为止，他们交售给国家的棉花，比去年同期多五十四万二千九百吨。目前，许多先进的国营农场和集体农庄正在展开迎接节日的竞赛，保证在十月革命节以前完成全年交售棉花的计划。许多新的生产指标已经在竞赛中创造出来。在乌兹别克共和国，纳玛干州的“纳伦”国营农场摘棉机手米尔扎巴耶夫，从每公顷（合十五市亩）的棉田上，至少摘棉一千五、六百公斤。塔什干州和卡什卡—达里亚州有许多摘棉机手，每天摘三、四吨棉花。卡什卡—达里亚州卡玛什区的植棉者首先完成了向国家交售棉花的全年计划。今年他们比去年总共多交了七百吨上等棉花。在吉尔吉斯共和国，许多摘棉机手都达到了每天摘四吨多棉花的水平。
    在收获其他农作物和秋耕方面，俄罗斯联邦斯摩棱斯克州赫斯拉维奇区的集体农民和农业机器操使者，最近已向全州农业劳动者发起了迎接节日的竞赛，争取顺利完成今年的各种农业工作。他们保证：在最近以前要收割完谷物和多年生牧草；到十月底向收购站交售亚麻产品；在十月上旬耕完秋耕地。这个号召已获得了全州许多区的农业劳动者的响应。在竞赛中，“基洛夫”、“自由劳动”、“纪念伊里奇”、“新生活”和其他集体农庄的庄员们，已顺利地完成或即将完成他们的竞赛计划。
    “基洛夫”集体农庄已经收割了谷物、亚麻和牧草，不损失一颗粮食和其他作物的种子。
