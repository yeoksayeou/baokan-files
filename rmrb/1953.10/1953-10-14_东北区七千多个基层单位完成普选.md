    Over Seven Thousand Grassroots Units in the Northeast Region Complete General Elections
    Currently, in the Northeast region, fourteen municipal districts, ninety-five towns and urban districts, and seven thousand six hundred and twenty-six villages have completed grassroots elections, accounting for approximately twenty-seven percent of all grassroots units in the region. In addition, forty-three municipal districts, fifty-two towns and urban districts, and nine thousand five hundred and ninety villages have completed population surveys and voter registration.
    Fushun City completed its grassroots elections in mid-August and is now preparing to convene a district people's congress. In Songjiang Province, seventy-two percent of rural areas completed grassroots elections before the autumn harvest. In Rehe Province, population surveys and voter registration have been completed in four thousand and sixty-eight grassroots units, with elections to commence after the autumn harvest. In Anshan and Benxi Cities, the general election work in the suburbs has concluded, while pilot projects are underway in the urban areas. The general election work in Lushun-Dalian City will be rolled out within October.
    During the general election movement, people in various regions demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm. In Jilin Province, over ninety percent of eligible voters participated in the elections. In Liaodong Province, over eighty percent of eligible voters participated.
    In the course of the elections, the broad masses of grassroots cadres received profound education under the scrutiny of the masses. Through the selection by the masses, outstanding cadres from the original rural areas and activists from among the masses were elected into the grassroots government, while cadres who violated laws and regulations and bad elements were removed, making the grassroots government organizations more pure and consolidated. In the rural areas of Liaodong Province where elections have been completed, over eighty percent of the original cadres were re-elected. In Paoshou Village, Shuangyang County, Jilin Province, most of the original ten cadres were active and responsible in their work, and eight of them were re-elected this time. In Bayan County, Songjiang Province, out of the original five hundred and forty-seven village cadres in the eighth, ninth, and eleventh districts, four hundred and twenty-six were re-elected. The cadres or people's representatives elected in various regions have broad representation; in urban areas, the people's representatives include people from all walks of life. In villages in Songjiang Province and the suburbs of Anshan City, women account for approximately twenty percent of the people's representatives elected; among the four hundred and ninety-seven representatives, there are twelve representatives from the Korean ethnic group.
    Another significant achievement of the general election movement is that the relationship between the government and the people, and between cadres and the masses, has become closer. The newly elected cadres have an unprecedented increase in their work enthusiasm and are determined to lead the masses in doing a good job in production. At the first people's congresses convened in various regions, solving production problems was the central agenda item. After the meetings, cadres and people's representatives took the lead in implementing the resolutions of the congresses. In Wangmagou Village, Panshi County, Jilin Province, all the cadres and representatives led the masses in implementing the resolutions of the people's congress, and within three days, they repaired the village's roads and the roads leading to other villages to facilitate the autumn harvest. The masses in Yongning Village launched a manure accumulation competition. In Yong'an Village, Bin County, Songjiang Province, after the convening of the people's congress, all forty-odd cadres in the village, under the leadership of the village head Wang Hongxian, have hoed all the wheat stubble in the village, greatly increasing the production enthusiasm of the masses. Currently, the vast numbers of farmers in various regions are actively engaged in the autumn harvest and production.
    At present, it is the autumn harvest season in the rural areas of the Northeast. In order to concentrate efforts on doing a good job in the autumn harvest, the cadres involved in the general election work are combining the general election publicity work and shifting to leading the autumn harvest. During the autumn harvest, the election committees of various provinces will concentrate their efforts on carrying out grassroots general elections in towns and cities.

    东北区七千多个基层单位完成普选
    东北地区目前已有十四个市辖区、九十五个镇和城关区、七千六百二十六个村完成了基层选举，约占全区基层单位的百分之二十七。此外，尚有四十三个市辖区、五十二个镇和城关区、九千五百九十个村结束了人口调查和选民登记。
    抚顺市在八月中旬即已结束基层选举，现正准备召开区人民代表大会；松江省百分之七十二的农村已在秋收前完成基层选举；热河省已在四千零六十八个基层单位中完成人口调查和选民登记工作，秋收后将进入选举阶段；鞍山、本溪两市市郊的普选工作已结束，市内正在进行典型试办；旅大市的普选工作将于十月内铺开。
    在普选运动中，各地人民表现了高度的积极性。吉林省参加选举的选民，占全体选民的百分之九十以上。辽东省百分之八十以上的选民参加了选举。
    在选举过程中，广大基层干部在群众鉴别下受到深刻教育。经过群众挑选，原有农村中的优秀干部和群众中的积极分子被选入基层政权，违法乱纪的干部和坏分子则被清除出去，使基层政权组织更加纯洁与巩固。辽东省已经完成选举的农村，百分之八十以上的原有干部连选连任。吉林省双阳县炮手村原有十名干部，绝大多数工作积极负责，这次选举中有八名连选连任。松江省巴彦县八、九、十一三个区原有五百四十七名村干部，这次有四百二十六人连选连任。各地选出的干部或人民代表，都具有广泛的代表性；在城镇，人民代表则包括各个阶层。松江省和鞍山市郊各村选出的人民代表，妇女占百分之二十左右；在四百九十七名代表中，有朝鲜族代表十二名。
    普选运动的另一重大成果，是政府和人民、干部和群众的关系更加密切了。新选出的干部工作积极性空前提高，决心领导群众搞好生产。在各地召开的第一次人民代表大会上，都以解决生产问题为中心议题。会后，干部和人民代表带头贯彻大会决议。吉林磐石县王麻沟村全体干部和代表带动群众执行人民代表大会决议，三天内修好了村里的公路和通往其他村的道路，以便秋收；永宁村的群众展开了积肥竞赛。松江省宾县永安村在召开人民代表大会后，全村四十多名干部在村长王洪先领导下已耠完全村麦槎，群众生产积极性大大提高。现各地广大农民正积极进行秋收和生产。
    目前，东北农村正值秋收。各省为集中力量作好秋收工作，普选工作干部正结合普选宣传工作，转入领导秋收。在秋收期间，各省选举委员会将集中力量开展城镇的基层普选。
