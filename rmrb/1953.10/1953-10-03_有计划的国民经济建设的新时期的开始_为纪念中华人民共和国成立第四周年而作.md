The Beginning of a New Period of Planned National Economic Construction
—Written in Commemoration of the Fourth Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China
Lin Boqu, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

October 1st this year marks the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people excitedly review the fruits of their labor and struggle over the past year and enter the fifth year of the Republic with victorious confidence.

1953 is the year the People's Republic of China began to enter a new period of planned national economic construction.

The founding of the People's Republic of China ended the history of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China and inaugurated a new era in which China gradually transitioned to a socialist society. Over the past four years, the Chinese people have carried out a series of arduous and great struggles to prepare conditions for the planned start of national industrialization and the transition to socialism.

Immediately following the national liberation, social reforms were widely carried out throughout the country: the feudal land ownership system was abolished, and peasants were given land; the remaining forces of counter-revolution were suppressed; the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in state organs and state-owned economic institutions, as well as the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship and theft of state economic intelligence in private industrial and commercial enterprises, greatly strengthened the leading role of the socialist economy in the national economy; intellectuals underwent ideological remolding, clearing out the anti-people and anti-scientific ideas left over from the old society, and establishing the revolutionary idea of serving the people. The completion of this series of social reforms provided the necessary political and ideological conditions for carrying out planned economic construction.

The Chinese people waged the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and in their joint struggle with the Korean people, pushed the American invading forces from the Yalu River and Tumen River back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, not only ensuring the independence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but also effectively guaranteeing the defense security of the People's Republic of China. In the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the Chinese people responded with a high degree of political enthusiasm to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers," so that the restoration of our national economy was not only not hindered by the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, but was accelerated.

The restoration of our national economy was completed by the end of 1952. In 1952, the main agricultural and industrial products, except for coal, which had more than doubled the 1949 level but had not yet exceeded the highest annual output before liberation, the production of other products such as electricity, crude oil, pig iron, steel, copper, cement, cotton cloth, paper, sugar, grain, cotton, and flue-cured tobacco not only exceeded the 1949 level, but also exceeded the highest annual output in China's history.

In the process of economic recovery, not only did the proportion of modern industrial output value increase in the total industrial and agricultural output value of our country, but also the proportion of socialist industrial output value increased in the total industrial output value of our country. In 1952, the proportion of state-owned industry of a socialist nature in the total output value of modern industry was about 60 percent, about 80 percent in heavy industry, and about 50 percent in light industry. State-owned commerce and cooperative commerce accounted for more than 50 percent of the commodity circulation in the domestic market and 32 percent of retail sales.

The completion of social democratic reforms, the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and the recovery of the national economy have created the necessary and favorable conditions for our country to carry out planned national economic construction.

From 1953, the People's Republic of China began to implement the First Five-Year Plan for economic construction. The basic tasks of this plan are: first, to concentrate major efforts on developing heavy industry, establishing the foundation for national industrialization and national defense modernization; correspondingly, to train construction personnel, develop transportation, light industry, agriculture, and expand commerce; to promote the collectivization of agriculture and handicrafts in a planned way and to carry out the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, and to correctly bring into play the role of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. All of these are to ensure the steady growth of the proportion of socialist components in the national economy, and to ensure the gradual improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards on the basis of developing production.

Within five years, China will vigorously develop the ferrous metallurgical industry, the non-ferrous metallurgical industry, the machine manufacturing industry, the petroleum industry, the coal industry, power stations, and the national defense industry. In addition to the existing industrial bases, new industrial bases will be established in the resource-rich hinterland. Many textile mills, paper mills, chemical fertilizer plants, food factories, etc., with modern equipment will be established in the emerging industrial cities in the hinterland near the raw material producing areas. New railway lines and road networks will connect many large cities, new industrial and mining areas, and important producing areas of certain grains and industrial raw materials. China will have its own independent industry, capable of producing various machine tools, generators, automobiles, and tractors. The ideal that the Chinese people have longed for for many years—to establish a strong and independent industry—will become a reality. People's lives will be further improved, and people will have increased opportunities for education.

This year is the first year of the First Five-Year Plan. This year, the total industrial output value is expected to increase by 23 percent compared to 1952. Socialist state-owned industries will increase by 32 percent, capitalist industries will increase by 9 percent; industries producing means of production will increase by about 35 percent, and industries producing means of subsistence will increase by about 16 percent.

Since the beginning of this year, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people of the whole country have enthusiastically plunged into the tide of national construction while strengthening the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and striving for the realization of an armistice in Korea. In the first half of this year, the output of the main products of state-owned industries has completed 101 percent of the plan, many new factories and mines have been completed one after another, our country's first large-scale steel rolling plant and seamless steel tube plant have been established, mechanized open-pit coal mines have begun production, huge hydroelectric generators and many thermal power plants have begun generating electricity, automobile manufacturing plants have begun construction, and new textile mills are being established one after another. There are nine railway lines under construction, of which 608 kilometers of railways will be open to traffic this year. This year's water conservancy projects on the Huai River and Yongding River, which are of grand scale, have successfully completed the plan. Now the people of the whole country are launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy, striving to increase production, practice economy, and fight to overfulfill this year's national economic construction plan.

While carrying out economic construction, the People's Republic of China has launched a universal suffrage movement throughout the country. More than 3,500 townships and cities across the country have completed elections, and it is expected that elections at the county level nationwide will be completed by the spring of next year. This election has greatly stimulated the political enthusiasm of the masses, strengthened the relationship between the people's government and the working masses, and further strengthened the people's democratic system.

While carrying out domestic construction, the Chinese people have never forgotten the existence of the international capitalist encirclement. Although the U.S. aggressors were forced to accept the Korean armistice, they have not abandoned their policy of aggression. The U.S. authorities have concluded the so-called "U.S.-South Korea Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Syngman Rhee clique, aimed at turning southern Korea into a U.S. base for aggression. The U.S. government is trying to sabotage the political conference, obstruct the reaching of an agreement on the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, and obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. U.S. troops still occupy our territory of Taiwan. The U.S. government is stepping up the rearmament of Japanese militarist forces and plotting new acts of aggression in the Far East. All this cannot but arouse the high vigilance of the Chinese people. The Chinese people are determined to work with the Korean people and with all the peace and democratic forces in the world headed by the Soviet people to fight for the full realization of the Korean armistice agreement and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and to strive for the easing of the international situation.

The great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, the alliance of friendship and mutual assistance between these two countries, is the guarantee of the consolidation and development of the People's Republic of China and the guarantee of the world peace and democracy cause. The Chinese people are working tirelessly to strengthen the unity with the Soviet people. The Soviet Union's assistance to our country's economic construction is a decisive and favorable condition for the Chinese people to carry out national industrialization. The Soviet government has agreed to help our country build 141 enterprises of great significance to China's industrialization within a few years. This is a large-scale assistance based on internationalism of mutual assistance and seeking common development. The Chinese people deeply thank the Soviet Union for this great, comprehensive, long-term, and selfless assistance to our country.

The Communist Party of China is the standard-bearer for the Chinese people in carrying out great construction and heroic struggle. While leading the people of the whole country in carrying out planned national construction, the Communist Party of China pays great attention to strengthening the Party ranks and strengthening the Party's ties with the working masses. Over the past year, the Party has taken many measures to strengthen the education of Marxism-Leninism among cadres and Party members, eliminate bourgeois ideology, oppose subjectivism, bureaucracy, decentralism, and commandism tendencies, overcome impatience and conservative ideas in work, rectify Party organizations and discipline, and strengthen the Party's unified leadership, so as to further closely link with the masses and lead all the people to struggle for the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the gradual transition to socialism.

With the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and its great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, with the sincere and enormous help of the Soviet Union, and with the support of the people's democratic countries and the world's peace and democratic forces, the Chinese people will surely be able to overcome any difficulties and obstacles on the road forward and march from victory to victory.

    有计划的国民经济建设的新时期的开始
    ——为纪念中华人民共和国成立第四周年而作
    中国共产党中央政治局委员　林伯渠
    今年十月一日，是中华人民共和国成立第四周年的纪念日。中国人民兴奋地检阅自己一年来的劳动和战斗的成果，怀着胜利的信心进入共和国的第五年。
    一九五三年是中华人民共和国开始进入有计划的国民经济建设的新时期的一年。
    中华人民共和国的成立，结束了半封建、半殖民地的旧中国的历史，开创了中国逐步过渡到社会主义社会的新纪元。四年来，中国人民进行了一系列的艰巨而伟大的斗争，为有计划地开始国家工业化和过渡到社会主义准备条件。
    紧接着全国解放之后，在全国范围内广泛地进行了社会改革：封建的土地所有制被消灭了，农民分得了土地；反革命的残余势力被镇压了；在国家机关和国营经济机关中反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争以及在私营工商业中反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争，使社会主义经济在国民经济中的领导作用大大加强了；知识分子进行了思想改造，清算了旧社会遗留下来的反人民、反科学的思想，确立了为人民服务的革命的思想。这一系列的社会改革的完成，在政治上和思想上为进行有计划的经济建设准备了必要的条件。
    中国人民进行了伟大的抗美援朝斗争，在与朝鲜人民并肩奋斗中，把美国侵略军从鸭绿江和图们江打退到三八线附近，不仅保障了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立，而且使中华人民共和国的国防安全得到了有力的保证。中国人民在抗美援朝运动中用高度的政治积极性响应了毛主席的“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召，使我国的国民经济的恢复工作不仅没有因抗美援朝而受到妨碍，反而加速进行了。
    我国国民经济的恢复工作，到一九五二年底已告完成。一九五二年农业和工业的主要产品，除煤炭已超过一九四九年水平一倍，但尚未超过解放前最高年产量以外，其余如电力、原油、生铁、钢、铜、水泥、棉布、纸、糖、谷物、棉花和烤烟等的生产量，都不仅超过了一九四九年的水平，而且也超过了我国历史上最高的年产量。
    在经济恢复的过程中，不但现代工业产值在我国工农业总产值中的比重提高了，而且社会主义工业产值在我国工业总产值中的比重也提高了。在一九五二年，社会主义性质的国营工业在现代性的工业总产值中的比重，约占百分之六十，在重工业方面占百分之八十左右，在轻工业方面占百分之五十左右。国营商业和合作社商业，在国内市场商品流转额中占百分之五十以上，在零售额中占百分之三十二。
    社会民主改革的完成，抗美援朝斗争的胜利，以及国民经济的恢复，给我国进行有计划的国民经济建设造成了必要的和有利的条件。
    从一九五三年起，中华人民共和国开始实行第一个经济建设的五年计划。这个计划的基本任务是：首先集中主要力量发展重工业，建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础；相应地培养建设人材，发展交通运输业、轻工业、农业和扩大商业；有步骤地促进农业、手工业的合作化和进行对私营工商业的社会主义改造，并正确发挥个体农业、手工业和私营工商业的作用。所有这些，都是为了保证国民经济中社会主义成分的比重的稳步增长，为了保证在发展生产的基础上逐步提高人民物质生活和文化生活的水平。
    在五年内，中国将大力发展黑色金属冶金工业、有色金属冶金工业、机器制造工业、石油工业、煤炭工业、电力站以及国防工业。除现有的工业基地外，新的工业基地将在矿藏丰富的内地建立起来。许多有现代化设备的纺织厂、造纸厂、化学肥料厂、食品工厂等将在接近原料产地的内地的新兴的工业城市中建立起来。新的铁路线和公路网将把许多大城市、新的工矿区、某些谷物和工业原料的重要产地连结起来。中国将有自己的独立的工业，能够自己生产各种工作母机、发电机、汽车、拖拉机。中国人民多少年来渴望建立强大的独立的工业的理想，将要成为现实。人民的生活将得到进一步改善，人民受教育的机会也将有增加。
    今年是第一个五年建设计划的第一年。今年，预计工业生产总值将较一九五二年增长百分之二十三。社会主义的国营工业将增加百分之三十二，资本主义工业增加百分之九；制造生产资料的工业将增加百分之三十五左右，制造生活资料的工业将增加百分之十六左右。
    今年以来，全国人民在中国共产党的领导下，在加强抗美援朝、争取朝鲜停战实现的同时，热烈地投入了国家建设的浪潮中。今年上半年国营工业的主要产品的生产量，已完成了计划的百分之一○一，许多新的厂矿已相继竣工，我国第一座大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂已经建立起来，机械化的露天煤矿已开始生产，巨大的水力发电机和许多个火力发电厂已开始发电，汽车制造厂已开始建筑，新的纺织厂正陆续建立起来。正在施工的铁路线有九条，其中六○八公里铁路将在本年内通车。规模宏大的淮河、永定河的今年度水利工程已胜利地完成计划。现在全国人民正展开增产节约运动，努力增加生产，厉行节约，为超额完成今年度国民经济建设计划而斗争。
    中华人民共和国在开始进行经济建设的同时，在全国范围展开了普选运动。全国已有三千五百多个乡镇和城市完成了选举，预计到明年春季全国县一级的选举将告完成。这次选举大大激发了人民群众的政治积极性，密切了人民政府与劳动群众的关系，进一步加强了人民民主制度。
    中国人民在进行国内建设时，一刻也没有忘记国际资本主义包围的存在。美国侵略者虽然被迫接受朝鲜停战，但仍然没有放弃它的侵略政策。美国当局已与李承晚集团订定了旨在把朝鲜南部变为美国侵略基地的所谓“美韩共同防御条约”。美国政府正力图破坏政治会议，阻挠达成从朝鲜撤退外国军队的协议，阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。美国军队仍然占据我国领土台湾。美国政府正加紧重新武装日本军国主义势力，并在远东策动新的侵略行动。这一切不能不引起中国人民的高度警惕。中国人民决心和朝鲜人民一起，和以苏联人民为首的全世界和平民主力量一起，为朝鲜停战协定的完全实现和朝鲜问题的和平解决而奋斗，并且为争取缓和国际局势而奋斗。
    中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，这两个国家的友好互助同盟，是中华人民共和国的巩固和发展的保证，也是世界和平民主事业的保证。中国人民努力不懈地加强与苏联人民间的团结。苏联对我国经济建设的援助，是中国人民进行国家工业化的决定性的有利条件。苏联政府已同意在数年内帮助我国建设一百四十一个对中国工业化有巨大意义的企业。这是建立在互相帮助和求得共同发展的国际主义基础上的巨大规模的援助。中国人民深深地感谢苏联对我国的这种伟大的、全面的、长期的、无私的援助。
    中国共产党是中国人民进行伟大建设和英勇斗争的旗手。中国共产党在领导全国人民进行有计划的国家建设时，十分注意加强党的队伍，加强党和劳动群众的联系。一年以来，党采取了许多措施，在干部和党员中加强马克思列宁主义的教育，肃清资产阶级的思想，反对主观主义、官僚主义、分散主义和命令主义的倾向，克服工作中的急躁冒进和保守思想，整顿党的组织和纪律，加强党的统一领导，以进一步密切联系群众，领导全体人民为逐步实现社会主义的工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义而斗争。
    有了中国共产党及其伟大领袖毛泽东同志的英明领导，有了苏联的真诚的巨大的帮助，有了各人民民主国家及全世界和平民主力量的支援，中国人民一定能够克服在前进道路上的任何困难和障碍，从胜利走向胜利。
