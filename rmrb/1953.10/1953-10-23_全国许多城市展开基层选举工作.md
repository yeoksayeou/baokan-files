The first nationwide election movement in the history of the Chinese people has been steadily unfolding in major cities. Since April of this year, 93 of China's 159 cities have successively conducted pilot projects for basic-level general elections. At present, the pilot work for basic-level general elections in various cities has come to an end, and more than 60 cities have launched basic-level general election work in batches, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Xi'an, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Harbin, Anshan, Nanjing, Dihua, Ya'an, Gui Sui, and Zunyi. The basic-level elections in Fuzhou and Fushun have been completely concluded.

This great and significant general election movement has attracted the participation of people from all walks of life in our cities, who have demonstrated high political enthusiasm in the movement. According to a survey of 42 electoral districts and one factory in Fushun, Harbin, Shanghai, Jinan, and Qingdao, the average voter turnout for election meetings was 94.34% of the total number of voters. In the Guanyinqiao electoral district of District 1 in Chongqing, more than 99% of voters participated in the election. The number of votes obtained by elected representatives was extremely concentrated, and there were few instances of invalid votes or abstentions. For example, in a certain electoral district in Shanghai, the number of votes for elected representatives averaged around 80% of the number of voters who participated in the election, with the highest reaching 99%.

In the general election, people from all walks of life in various cities actively assisted in carrying out the general election work. In order to promote the general election work, some industrial and mining enterprises in Anshan and Fushun in the Northeast Region, Tianjin in the North China Region, and Qingdao in the East China Region, transferred capable cadres to form general election working groups, which worked under the unified leadership of the local election committees.机关 workers, urban residents, and housewives also enthusiastically participated in the general election. Staff from the CPC Changshu Municipal Committee, Changshu Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and other units used their spare time to carry out propaganda work among residents. Literary and art workers in Nanjing organized a propaganda team to promote the significance of the general election and went deep into the masses to carry out propaganda. In Tianjin, more than 10,000 female cadres and female representatives from the masses, under the leadership of the local election committee and the Democratic Women's Federation, went door-to-door to carry out propaganda among the masses. Businessmen and industrialists in Jiujiang studied relevant documents on the general election in preparation for the election.

In areas where general elections have been held, the unity of people from all walks of life has been further strengthened; workers have displayed their enthusiasm and creativity in production, and productivity has been improved. Workers and technicians in the dyeing vat workshop of the Tianyi Machine Weaving and Dyeing Factory in Putuo District, Shanghai, used foot-printed dyed mercerized Shilin cloth on the eve of the election meeting, saving 5% of the dye and 15% of the caustic soda, without affecting the quality of the finished product. Cai Zhongyuan and Xin Dezhang, leaders of the Canal Construction Site Working Group in Shenyang, led workers to actively produce during the general election, increasing the amount of earth filling per person per day from six cubic meters to nine cubic meters. Workers in the carpentry workshop of the Tianjin Machine Tool Repair Factory created the "large window scribing machine," "small window scribing machine," and "nail crimping method," which tripled work efficiency. Many new phenomena have also emerged among street residents, and some elderly people, hotel guests, and independent laborers who did not participate much in political movements in the past have all become involved in the general election movement. Many activists in the streets reflected: "This movement has left a very deep impression in people's hearts." After the general election, the relationship between most cadres and the masses has been further strengthened, and the initiative of cadres in their work has been improved. Xinmin Street in the Hui Autonomous Region of Guisui had the worst sanitation work before the general election. After the general election movement, cadres led residents to insist on daily environmental sanitation work, and it was awarded the title of sanitary model street in Guisui.

According to the experience of various places, urban general election work can not only be combined with production, but also become a force for promoting production work and learning. Lixin Yarn Factory in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, Shenyang Chemical Plant, Harbin Woolen Mill, Fushun Open-Pit Coal Mine, and other units enlightened workers' sense of ownership through general election propaganda and education, launched labor competitions, and generally improved production. In factories and mines, the experience of many units has proved that if the responsible cadres of factories and mines personally participate in the leadership of the general election work, it is extremely beneficial to both the general election and production. For example, the deputy director and the chairman of the trade union of the state-owned 301 Factory served as the leader and deputy leader of the general election working group, respectively. At the beginning of the general election, they also organized cadres above the section level in the factory to study the election law, and at the same time, combined with the factory's production situation, they carried out propaganda on the combination of general election and production among the workers, which not only promoted the general election, but also improved production.

Adopting flexible working methods is the key to carrying out urban general election work. In order to adapt to the characteristics of urban general elections, various places have created and explored many simple and easy-to-implement working methods. The Chongqing Election Committee established a general election reception room to specially receive people who came to visit and report on election matters. The reception room classified the opinions of the masses who visited or wrote letters into four categories: reporting, accusing, inquiring, and requesting, and handled them separately; those that could be answered were answered immediately, and those that could not be answered were responsible for forwarding them to relevant departments for processing. In this way, the opinions of the broad masses of the people on the general election could be quickly reflected, and the connection with the masses was strengthened. Beijing took into account the various different situations of the masses and used the method of setting up voting stations in sections; Jinan held election meetings in three batches, morning, noon, and evening, and voters could freely choose the time; independent laborers who went out early and returned late were given the convenience of voting alone; and "on-site elections" were adopted for patients, the elderly, the disabled, and lying-in women, which achieved good results.

    全国许多城市展开基层选举工作
    中国人民历史上第一次全国性的选举运动已在各大城市稳步展开。从今年四月份开始，在我国一百五十九个城市中，有九十三个城市先后进行了基层普选的典型试办工作。目前，各城市的基层普选典型试办工作已经结束，已有六十多个城市分批展开了基层普选工作，其中包括北京、天津、沈阳、西安、重庆、广州、哈尔滨、鞍山、南京、迪化、雅安、归绥、遵义等城市。福州和抚顺两市的基层选举已经全部结束。
    这个具有伟大意义的普选运动，吸引了我国各城市各阶层人民参加，他们在运动中表现了很高的政治热情。据抚顺、哈尔滨、上海、济南、青岛等五个市、四十二个选区、一个工厂的调查，参加选举大会的选民平均占选民总数的百分之九十四点三四。重庆市一区观音岩选区百分之九十九以上的选民参加了选举。当选代表得到的票数极为集中，很少发现废票、弃权的现象。如上海市某一选区，当选代表的票数，平均占参加选举的选民人数的百分之八十左右，最高的达到百分之九十九。
    在普选中，各城市各阶层人民积极协助开展普选工作。东北区鞍山市、抚顺市，华北区天津市以及华东区青岛市等地的若干工矿企业，为了推动普选工作，曾抽调得力干部，成立普选工作小组，在当地选举委员会的统一领导下进行工作。机关工作者、城市居民和家庭妇女，也热情地参加普选。中共常熟市委、常熟市总工会等单位的工作人员，利用业余时间到居民中去做宣传工作；南京市文艺工作者为迎接普选，组织了一支宣传队伍，深入到群众中宣传普选的意义；天津市有一万多名妇女干部和群众中的妇女代表，在当地选举委员会和民主妇联的领导下，挨门挨户地向群众进行宣传；九江市工商界人士为迎接普选，学习了有关普选的文件。
    举行了普选的地区，各阶层人民的团结进一步加强了；工人们发挥了生产积极性和创造性，提高了生产率。上海市普陀区天一机织印染厂染缸间的工人和技术员，在召开选举大会的前夕，利用脚水印染丝光士林布，节约了百分之五的染料和百分之十五的烧碱，而且没有影响成品的质量。沈阳运河工地工作组组长蔡中元、辛德章，在普选中带动工人积极生产，使每人每天的填土工程由六立方公尺提高到九立方公尺。天津机具修造厂木工车间工人创造了“大窗划线机”、“小窗划线机”、“钉子压线法”，使工作效率提高了三倍。在街道居民中也出现了许多新气象，过去不大参加政治运动的一些老年人、旅店客人、独立劳动者，都卷入了普选运动。街道中的许多积极分子反映：“这次运动在人的心坎里留下了很深的印象。”经过普选以后，多数干部和群众的关系进一步密切了，干部在工作方面的主动性提高了。归绥市回民自治区新民街在普选前卫生工作做得最差，普选运动后，干部领导居民每日坚持进行环境卫生工作，得到归绥市卫生模范街的称号。
    根据各地的经验，城市普选工作不但可以结合生产进行，而且可以成为推动生产工作和学习的力量。江苏省无锡市丽新纱厂、沈阳化工厂、哈尔滨毛织厂、抚顺露天煤矿等单位，通过普选宣传教育，启发了工人的主人翁思想，开展了劳动竞赛，普遍改进了生产。在工厂矿山中开展普选工作，许多单位的经验证明，如果工厂矿山的负责干部亲自参加普选工作的领导，对普选和生产都极为有利。如国营三○一工厂的副厂长和工会主席分别担任了普选工作组的正副组长，在普选刚开始时，还组织了全厂科级以上的干部学习了选举法，同时又结合本厂生产情况，在工人中进行了关于普选结合生产的宣传，这样不但推动了普选，还提高了生产。
    采取灵活的工作方法是开展城市普选工作的关键。为适应城市普选的特点，各地在工作上创造和摸索出许多简而易行的工作方法。重庆市选举委员会成立了普选接待室，专门接待为普选问题来访的人民群众。接待室将群众来访或来信的意见分为检举、控告、询问和要求四类，分别处理；能解答的立刻解答，不能解答的负责转给有关部门处理。这样就使广大人民群众对普选的意见能很快地反映上来，密切了与群众的联系。北京市照顾到群众的各种不同情况用分段设站投票的办法；济南市又分早、中、晚三批召开选举大会，选民可以自由选择时间；对于早出晚归的独立劳动者，给予单独投票的方便；对病人、老年人、残废者以及产妇，采取了“就地选举”的方法，取得很好的成绩。
