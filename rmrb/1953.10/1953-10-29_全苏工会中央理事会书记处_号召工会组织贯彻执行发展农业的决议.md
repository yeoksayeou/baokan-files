Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 27th: According to TASS, Moscow, October 24th, the Secretariat of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions discussed the work of various trade union organizations regarding the resolution of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on measures for the further development of agriculture, and passed a corresponding resolution. The resolution pointed out that all trade union organizations must focus their attention on completing the plans formulated by the Central Committee of the CPSU for the further development of agriculture. It is now recommended that the central, republic, regional, state, factory and agency trade union committees and trade union councils: begin large-scale explanatory work among workers regarding the resolutions of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the report by N.S. Khrushchev, maximize the labor enthusiasm and creative initiative of workers and staff, and guide this labor enthusiasm and creative initiative to the victorious completion of the tasks prescribed by the Party Central Committee.

    The trade unions of workers and staff engaged in agriculture and agricultural product procurement must launch a broad socialist competition among workers, tractor drivers, and agricultural experts, striving to further develop all sectors of socialist agriculture, increase per-unit-area yield of crops, rapidly boost the public livestock industry and increase its product productivity, and increase the total output and commodity output of agriculture and livestock farming. Greater attention must be paid to the issue of labor productivity, and all machine operators should complete their quotas and effectively utilize machines. A mass movement of inventions and rationalization proposals should be developed, and all means should be used to develop and support the proposals and valuable initiatives of advanced agricultural workers, widely publicize their experiences, and strive to adopt advanced labor methods and the latest achievements of agricultural science and practical work.

    Greater and constant attention should be paid to meeting the cultural needs and daily requirements of workers and staff of machine tractor stations and state farms.

    The resolution also pointed out that trade unions in the industrial sectors of machinery, transportation and heavy machinery, chemicals, building materials, wood and paper, and other sectors of the national economy that produce orders needed for agriculture, should launch a broad socialist competition among workers, engineers, technicians, and other workers and staff, striving to ensure that various enterprises complete the production of orders needed for agriculture in a timely and effective manner, and strive to rapidly design and produce new types of tractors and agricultural machinery.

    The trade union organizations should make every effort to support the lofty aspirations of those workers, engineers, technicians, and agronomists who are willing to leave factories and agencies and go to the countryside for long-term work in order to contribute their labor to the implementation of the resolutions of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU.

    All trade union organizations should organize personnel from various industrial enterprises to help machine tractor stations, state farms, and collective farms so that they can better utilize machinery; they should impart the experience of outstanding turners, installers, and engineers to the machine operators of machine tractor stations and state farms.
