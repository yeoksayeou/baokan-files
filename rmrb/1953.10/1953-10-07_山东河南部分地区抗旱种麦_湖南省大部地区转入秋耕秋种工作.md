    Drought Resistance and Wheat Planting in Parts of Shandong and Henan
    Most Areas of Hunan Province Enter Autumn Cultivation and Planting

    In parts of Shandong and Henan provinces, there has been no rainfall for half a month, greatly affecting the progress of the current autumn cultivation and wheat planting work. Local leading bodies are mobilizing the masses to prevent and combat drought to ensure autumn planting and wheat planting.

    People's governments at all levels in areas severely affected by drought have attached importance to this situation and have taken a number of emergency measures. The Lin'yi Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Shandong Province issued instructions requiring all localities to deeply mobilize the masses to do a good job in drought resistance, and the Deputy Commissioner of the Commissioner's Office and the Deputy Commander of the Military Sub-district led more than 100 cadres from government offices to drought-stricken counties and districts to help with the work. Under the principle of not affecting work, they also organized more than 500 cadres from government offices, troops, enterprises, and other departments to help the masses irrigate and rush to cultivate. The people's governments of most counties have also successively issued emergency instructions on drought resistance work, convened meetings of district and township cadres to study how to strengthen drought resistance work. Yishui, Tancheng, and other six counties have sent more than 300 cadres to drought-stricken areas to strengthen specific guidance in drought resistance, autumn protection, and rush cultivation. In general, old farmers' symposiums have been held in various drought-stricken areas to study drought resistance methods. Through typical demonstrations and organized visits, the cadres' and the masses' paralysis, fluke mentality, and passive waiting-for-rain thinking have been initially overcome, the masses' confidence in drought resistance has been enhanced, and the work of drought prevention, drought resistance, autumn protection, and rush cultivation has been promoted. In Tancheng County, more than 620 households have irrigated 719 mu of late autumn crops, and in Junan County, six townships have splashed water to cultivate 146 mu of land and irrigated 621 mu of late autumn crops. The Ninth District of Tai'an County held an agricultural technology symposium, and through summarizing the experience of local masses, educated cadres and mutual aid team leaders to recognize that land preparation to preserve soil moisture, drought resistance, and rush cultivation are the key to ensuring increased production. This promoted the autumn cultivation and planting work in the entire district. Zhangjiazhai Village in Laixi County also reorganized and consolidated the mutual aid teams through autumn cultivation work, actively helping each other in autumn cultivation and planting. In order to strive for no reduction in late autumn production and timely planting of wheat, the Shandong Provincial People's Government has once again called on all localities to organize the masses to quickly take action to prevent and combat drought and do a good job in autumn cultivation and planting. The leading organs of the Xinxiang and Anyang Prefectural Commissioner's Offices in Henan Province have issued instructions requiring all localities to earnestly lead the masses in drought prevention and soil moisture conservation and to plant wheat well. The Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office held various cadre meetings and mutual aid team leader meetings, breaking the complacent idea that "autumn cultivation and planting do not require leadership" and "let's talk about it after the threshing floor is cleared." They also used the example of wheat seedlings freezing to death due to late wheat planting last year to educate the masses and mobilize them to quickly cultivate the land and plant wheat. Wenxian, Jiyuan, Qinyang, Boai, and other counties in the district have held expanded cadre meetings to deploy autumn cultivation and wheat planting. Currently, six rivers in the district have begun to release water for irrigation, and the masses in many areas are also actively using wells and springs for irrigation and land preparation to preserve soil moisture. County and district cadres in Anyang Prefecture went deep into the masses to help them arrange production and paid special attention to solving the difficulties of individual households and widowed and orphaned households who lacked labor and livestock in cultivating the land and planting wheat. Just Anyang, Ye County, and Qi County mobilized the masses to organize more than 3,000 temporary mutual aid teams to solve this problem. Luoyang, Yiyang, and other counties in the Luoyang Prefecture are also working very hard. Six townships, including Shicun Village in Yiyang County, opened a new 800-zhang-long canal, which has irrigated 850 mu of land, and repaired an old canal, which has irrigated 460 mu of land. Luoning County is universally repairing old canals, with 1,800 people going to the canals every day. The county has now irrigated 30,000 to 40,000 mu of land. The masses in Yongcheng County have dug more than 1,100 earth wells. The masses in Yuxian, Changge, and other counties have also generally taken action. Drought prevention and resistance movements are underway in other drought-affected areas.

    In addition, most areas of Hunan Province have completed the autumn harvest and have successively entered the autumn cultivation and planting work. All localities have strengthened the leadership of the autumn cultivation and planting work. The autumn cultivation and planting in the lakefront areas is relatively fast, with some having planted 60% to 70% of the area that should be planted. In some places, the autumn planting area has expanded significantly compared with previous years. Yiyang County alone has increased the autumn planting area by 40% compared with last year, and Chaling County has increased it by 31%. Party committees and people's governments at all levels vigorously mobilized the masses and organized temporary mutual aid teams to solve difficulties such as labor, livestock, and food rations. For the seed problem, various localities have taken measures such as mutual adjustment, purchase from outside, exchange of labor, and exchange of seeds for rice to solve it. In Longtai Township, Hanshou County, 19 households lacked seeds, and they exchanged them with households with surplus seeds, solving the seed shortage problem. However, some cadres in the province still have a relaxed attitude, and some masses have a wait-and-see attitude. In Dawei Township, Li County, many cattle are idle and not used, but only 500 mu of the 2,600 mu of land that should be planted in the township have been planted. Farmers in disaster-stricken areas believe that the disaster has caused great losses, and autumn planting cannot make up for much of the loss, so they have a negative attitude. Some people say: "If the moon can't be relied on, rely on the stars!" Therefore, many people go out to engage in sideline occupations and do business. For example, some farmers in Tuoli Township, Longhui County, sold 20 cattle to go out to do business, which greatly affected the autumn planting work. The province is now paying attention to overcoming this phenomenon.

    山东河南部分地区抗旱种麦
    湖南省大部地区转入秋耕秋种工作
    山东、河南两省部分地区，半月以来未曾落雨，大大影响了当前秋耕种麦工作的进展。各地领导机关正发动群众防旱抗旱、保秋种麦。
    旱灾严重地区的各级人民政府已重视这一情况，并采取了若干紧急措施。山东省临沂专区发出指示要求各地深入发动群众作好抗旱工作，并由专署副专员、军分区副司令员带领机关干部一百多人，分赴旱灾县、区帮助工作。在不影响工作的原则下，又组织了机关、部队、企业等部门的干部五百多人，帮助该地群众浇水抢耕。多数县的人民政府也先后发出了关于抗旱工作的紧急指示，召开区乡干部会议，研究如何加强抗旱工作。沂水、郯城等六县已派出干部三百余人，深入灾区，加强抗旱、保秋、抢耕的具体指导。各旱灾地区一般都召开了老农座谈会，研究抗旱办法，通过典型示范，组织参观，初步克服干部与群众的麻痹侥幸心理和消极等雨思想，提高了群众抗旱信心，推动了防旱、抗旱、保秋、抢耕工作。郯城县已有六百二十余户浇晚秋七百一十九亩，莒南县六个乡泼水耕地一百四十六亩，浇晚秋六百二十一亩。泰安县第九区召开了农业技术座谈会，通过总结当地群众经验，教育干部和互助组组长认识了整地保墒，抗旱抢耕，是保证增产的关键。推动了全区秋耕秋种工作。莱西县张家寨村，还通过秋耕工作，整理和巩固了互助组，积极互助起来秋耕秋种。为了争取晚秋不减产和小麦及时下种，山东省人民政府又号召各地组织群众迅速行动起来防旱抗旱，作好秋耕秋种工作。河南省新乡、安阳专区领导机关都已发出指示，要求各地认真领导群众防旱保墒，把小麦种好。新乡专区召开各种干部会和互助组长会，打破了“秋耕秋种不用领导”“打完场再说”的松一口气的思想。并以当地去年因种麦晚而致麦苗冻死的事例，教育群众，发动群众赶快耕地种麦。该专区温县、济源、沁阳、博爱等县已开过扩大干部会议，布置秋耕种麦。现全区已有六条河流开始放水浇地，不少地区群众也积极利用井泉浇水和整地保墒。安阳专区各县的县、区干部深入群众，帮助群众安排生产，并且特别注意解决缺乏劳畜力的单干户和孤寡户的耕地种麦困难。只安阳、邺县、淇县等三县为解决这一问题，就发动群众组织了三千多个临时互助组。洛阳专区洛宁、宜阳等县也抓得很紧，宜阳县石村等六个乡开好一条八百丈长的新渠，已浇地八百五十亩，修好一条旧渠，浇地四百六十亩。洛宁县普遍修理旧渠，每天上渠群众达一千八百人，全县现已浇地三、四万亩。永城县群众已打土井一千一百多眼。禹县、长葛等县群众也都普遍行动起来。其他受旱地区的防旱抗旱运动正在开展中。
    又讯：湖南省大部地区秋收完毕，已先后转入秋耕秋种工作。各地都加强了秋耕秋种工作的领导。滨湖地区秋耕秋种较快，有的已种应种面积的百分之六、七十。有的地方秋种面积比往年扩大了许多，只益阳一县秋种面积比去年就增加了百分之四十，茶陵县增加百分之三十一。各地党委和人民政府大力发动群众，组织临时互助组，解决了劳力、畜力、口粮等的困难，对种子问题，各地采取了互相调剂、到外购买、用工兑换、用米换种等办法加以解决。汉寿县隆太乡有十九户缺种子，他们和有多余种子的户兑换，解决了缺种问题。但该省还有部分干部有松口气的思想，有些群众有等待观望情绪。澧县大围乡有不少耕牛闲着没有用，而全乡应种的二千六百亩田，却只种了五百亩。受灾地区的农民，则认为受灾损失大，秋种不能弥补多大损失，有消极情绪。有的人说：“月亮没靠住，还靠星！”因此，不少人都出去搞副业和做生意，如隆回县托里乡的部分农民就卖了二十头耕牛，出去作生意，这就大大影响了秋种工作。现在该省已注意克服这种现象。
