Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 26th -- The Korean-Chinese side delegation to the Korean Military Armistice Commission issued the following communique on the 26th:

    Facts have proven that the US side authorities, through the so-called staff provided by them at the Dongchang-ri POW camp hospital, as well as Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents placed among the sick and wounded prisoners of war, are turning the hospital into a killing field for the cruel murder of captured Korean and Chinese personnel. Wang Xianzhang and Wang Xiang, Chinese People's Volunteers captured personnel repatriated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, witnessed Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents on October 1st at the No. 44 POW hospital using the most brutal means to kill a Chinese People's Volunteer captured personnel surnamed Zhang.
    According to Wang Xianzhang and Wang Xiang's accusations: As early as a few days before October 1st, Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents began to "interrogate" the victim surnamed Zhang. He only answered that his surname was Zhang and did not answer his name and detention number. The special agents asked him more fiercely: "Where do you want to go?" Zhang said: "Return to China!" He was immediately cursed by the special agents, and then Zhang was deprived of food and drink for two days. On October 1st, the special agent Deng Hongxun ordered two other special agents to drag Zhang to the left rear corner of the tent, and struck Zhang's head and chest with wooden sticks more than twenty times, then tied Zhang to the bed, stuffed his mouth with a towel, the special agents jumped on the bed and trampled on Zhang's chest and abdomen with leather shoes, brushed the soles of his feet with a brush, and finally clamped Zhang's neck with a wooden stick, strangling him to death.
    The bloody crimes of special agents running rampant and arbitrarily torturing and killing prisoners of war in prisoner of war hospitals under Indian army guard are absolutely intolerable to people all over the world who advocate justice and humanity.
    General Li Xiangchao of the Korean-Chinese side has sent a letter to Lieutenant General Thimayya of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on October 25, requesting the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to immediately conduct a thorough investigation of this murderous tragedy, and severely punish the instigators and their murderers. General Li Xiangchao also stated: The Korean-Chinese side is willing to provide witnesses to assist in ascertaining the instigators and accomplices of this tragedy.

    李相朝将军致函蒂迈雅
    要求彻查美方特务在战俘医院制造的惨案
    【新华社开城二十六日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面代表团二十六日发表公报如下：
    事实证明：美方当局正通过其在东场里战俘营医院所提供的所谓工作人员，以及在病伤战俘中所布置的蒋介石、李承晚特务，将该医院变成残酷杀害朝中被俘人员的杀人场。中立国遣返委员会遣返归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员王宪章、王祥，曾目睹蒋匪特务于十月一日在第四十四号战俘医院以最残酷的手段杀害了一名姓张的中国人民志愿军被俘人员。
    据王宪章、王祥控诉：早在十月一日前几天，蒋匪特务就对姓张的被害者进行“审问”。他只回答说姓张，没有回答他的名字和拘留编号。特务分子更凶狠地问他：“你要到那里去？”张说：“回中国！”当场即遭特务大骂，此后即断绝张饮食两天。十月一日，特务邓鸿勋命令另外两名特务将张拉到帐篷左后角，用木棍猛击张的头部和胸部二十余下，然后将张捆在床上，用手巾塞住嘴，特务们跳到床上用皮鞋践踏张的胸部和腹部，用刷子刷他的脚心，最后又用木棍夹住张的脖子，活活将张夹死。
    对于印军看管下的战俘医院中所发生的特务分子横行霸道任意虐杀战俘的血腥罪行，决非全世界主张正义与人道的人民所能容忍的。
    朝中方面代表李相朝中将已于十月二十五日致函中立国遣返委员会蒂迈雅中将，要求中立国遣返委员会立即对此杀人惨案进行彻底调查，严惩杀人的主使者及其凶犯。李相朝中将并表示：朝中方面愿提供人证，协助查明此一惨案的主使者及帮凶。
