    Basic Summary of Work at Renmin University of China Over the Past Three Years
    Wu Yuzhang
    (I)
    Renmin University of China is a new type of regular university established after the founding of the People's Republic of China. This university received direct assistance from Soviet experts from the very beginning. From the formulation of teaching plans, the compilation of teaching outlines and textbooks, to the regulation of teaching organizations and teaching systems, it conscientiously and systematically adopted the advanced experience and latest scientific achievements of Soviet higher education institutions. At the same time, we also inherited the excellent traditions of revolutionary education from the old liberated areas, which served the people and linked theory with practice. Our teaching staff is composed of veteran cadres as the backbone, leading and uniting a large number of revolutionary and progressive young intellectuals and a small number of teaching staff from the old universities who have undergone ideological remolding. Although some of these veteran cadres have a lower level of education, they all have a certain amount of practical struggle experience and basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism. They can more easily understand the policies of the Party and the state, and they have long-term ideological, organizational, and historical ties with the Party and the state. Our training targets, in addition to progressive young students, are mainly industrial workers and worker-peasant cadres, who have been tested in various practical struggles and have practical struggle experience. All of these provide extremely favorable conditions for us to accept advanced Soviet science and advanced work experience and to combine them with China's reality. Our students are resolutely advancing towards science in order to complete the tasks of the Party, so they are not learning for the sake of learning, but for the sake of national construction. This kind of learning is naturally easy to link with practice. This again provides extremely favorable conditions for the correct and sound development of our school-building work.
    (II)
    The educational work of Renmin University of China over the past three years has been successful. Four thousand five hundred and eighty-seven students have graduated, including three thousand nine hundred and ninety-six from the specialized courses and five hundred and ninety-one from the undergraduate courses. This year, 443 students graduated from the six departments of undergraduate studies, including Economic Planning, Statistics, Factory Management, Finance and Credit, Trade, and Cooperatives. Among them, industrial workers accounted for 12%, revolutionary cadres accounted for 60%, and educated youth accounted for 28%; and more than 90% of them were Party and League members. This group of graduates has good composition and political quality. At the same time, they have systematically studied political theory and various professional knowledge, and have specialized skills, which has attracted the attention of relevant business departments. The state has assigned them jobs according to the principle of "applying what they have learned," and they are playing and are playing a major role in national construction in various work posts. Many people have used the knowledge and theories they have learned to improve and improve their work. For example, Ma Jincheng, a graduate of our school's specialized course, is now the director of the No. 1 Ship Repair Plant of the Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau; Che Zhenguo, the deputy director of the Northeast Machinery No. 3 Factory; and Xiao Huang, the chief of the allocation and clearing section of the Northwest Branch of the People's Bank of China, have all improved the organization and management of enterprises based on the "Accounting," "Statistics," and "Industrial Enterprise Organization and Planning" courses they learned at the school, combined with China's specific conditions, and applied advanced Soviet experience. New accounting systems were established, which had a decisive and positive impact on the work and was praised by all parties. This has basically changed the traditional malady of higher education in old China for decades, where "what was learned was not used" and "what was used was not learned," and has set a good example for the construction of higher education in new China.

    In the work of reforming national higher education institutions, Renmin University of China has provided helpful assistance. The first is to help solve the problem of teachers in higher education institutions, especially teachers of political theory courses. Over the past three years, 900 graduate students have graduated from the school, including 548 from outside the school. They have been assigned to work in 42 higher education institutions across the country, and have generally been welcomed by students and valued by leaders in teaching. At the same time, we have also transferred teachers and other teaching staff to other higher education institutions to directly help establish teaching organizations and carry out teaching work. Secondly, over the past three years, we have not only received visitors from higher education institutions across the country who have come to the school to visit and talk with them, and have given various materials, and have systematically introduced the experience of learning from the Soviet Union to the whole country in writing, but also have systematically supplied relevant agencies and schools with business teaching material reference materials, as well as more generally supplied political theory teaching materials and reference materials. According to incomplete statistics, over the past three years, more than 100 types of business teaching materials, political theory teaching materials and reference materials have been supplied to various places, totaling more than 1.66 million copies. Finally, at the invitation of some higher education institutions and industrial departments in Beijing and Tianjin, we have sent many political theory teachers and business teachers to give lectures. According to reports, this has been of great help to the political theory study and business work of various units. Although this is the case, the work we have done is still far from meeting the needs of higher education institutions. We will continue to strengthen this work as much as possible in the future.
    After three years of efforts, Renmin University of China has now reached a considerable scale. There are currently about 5,000 students in the school, and about 2,000 graduate students are being trained for higher education institutions across the country, and 2,700 correspondence students outside the school. If the teaching strength was weak at the beginning, then now we have trained about 700 teachers who can master a certain major, and 140 Russian translators, who have reached a certain quality in both interpreting and translating. Over the past three years, we have translated more than 1,300 kinds of teaching materials, printed 890,000 copies, and compiled more than 500 kinds of teaching materials, printed 702,911 copies, which can enable our students to obtain more learning materials. However, the rapid development of the objective situation and the rapid progress of national construction work require us not to continue to develop in large quantities in terms of quantity in the future, but to improve the quality of work on the original basis, first of all to improve the quality of leading cadres and teachers. Therefore, our school proposed the policy of consolidation and improvement in the last academic year, and then gradually turned to a more sound development path on this basis.
    (III)
    These achievements of Renmin University of China vividly prove that the Party Central Committee and the Central People's Government's decision to establish Renmin University of China was completely correct. The achievement of these achievements is due to the correct leadership and constant care of the Party Central Committee and the Central People's Government, the continuous guidance and help of the relevant business departments of the Central Committee, the enthusiastic and selfless assistance and teachings of Soviet experts, and the hard work of all cadres.
    The State Council of the Central People's Government once stipulated that the educational policy of Renmin University of China is "teaching is linked with practice, and Soviet experience is combined with China's situation." We have implemented this correct educational policy over the past three years. In our guiding ideology, we not only emphasize systematically learning advanced Soviet experience, but also emphasize systematically and closely paying attention to the actual problems in all aspects of China, and formulating our teaching plans, teaching content, and various teaching systems based on reality. Our first teaching plan was formulated with the direct assistance of Soviet experts, based on the teaching plans of relevant departments in the Soviet Union as a blueprint, and taking into account the characteristics of China's recovery period and the low level of students and teachers. The first teaching plan reduced unnecessary courses and class hours compared with the teaching plans of relevant departments in the Soviet Union, and increased the courses urgently needed in China; the specialized courses were not as carefully divided as in the Soviet Union; and necessary streamlining was also carried out in the teaching syllabus. With the development of our national construction and the gradual changes in the conditions of students and teachers, this year's teaching plan more comprehensively reflects the objective needs. Specialized courses are further divided into specializations; and Chinese materials are gradually reflected in the teaching syllabus and textbooks. Therefore, it is more accurate to say that our teaching plan is closer to the Soviet teaching plan now than it was at the beginning (of course, the current teaching plan is still very different from the Soviet teaching plan). Although due to lack of experience at the beginning, the phenomenon of heavier courses once occurred in the implementation of the first teaching plan, it was quickly corrected reasonably because it was basically correct. The production internship system stipulated in Soviet higher education institutions is an exceptionally superior system. Our school has conducted two large-scale production internships, and teachers and students unanimously believe that they have gained tremendous gains in linking theory with practice.
    We believe that we must first learn from the Soviet experience and learn theory. If we don't know what the Soviet experience and theory are all about, it is incorrect to try to link with reality, and we will often make mistakes. However, as teachers gradually learn and master Soviet experience and theory, they must systematically pay attention to practical problems and feel a strong interest in practical problems. Because without learning theory, we cannot analyze and explain practical problems, but if we only learn theory and do not study practical problems, theory cannot be deepened and cannot be learned well. In order to obtain the help of various departments in this regard, we have carried out a series of work and adopted effective measures. As early as the beginning of 1951, we requested the Central Committee to approve the notice from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government to earnestly help solve this problem, so our relationship with various business departments and even factories and mines became increasingly close. At first, we simply asked for help, mainly in the revision of teaching plans, the compilation of teaching syllabuses and textbooks, and scientific research, and asked them to participate in reviewing, invite them to make reports, provide materials, and participate in meetings with each other, which played a role in linking teaching with practice on a regular basis. Later, it gradually developed from the form of general contact contracts to scientific cooperation: the first is the scientific research group, that is, the teaching and research office and the business department designate a certain person in charge to jointly organize research. The second is the combination of enterprise management training courses and production internships: for example, we have established extremely extensive contacts with the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee's Industry Department. Teachers can go to factories at any time to collect materials, and at the same time answer questions and conduct counseling for factories. Last September, the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee's Industry Department organized enterprise management training courses, mainly for factory directors, workshop directors, and incumbent cadres above the Party Committee Secretary, with more than 1,600 people participating in amateur study. We sent teacher Wang Jiamo to give lectures for one semester, four hours a week. Because the content of the lectures met their needs and improved their work, they were warmly welcomed. Mainly, the teachers combined the current problems existing in the planning and management of factories and mines and systematically lectured on the application of advanced Soviet experience, especially the lecture on "Technical Organization Measures Plan," which helped them more to carry out production reforms and strengthen planning management. This advanced scientific cooperation one step further. This is a new form of combining science and production, and we are preparing to promote it. The third is to send teachers to participate in the specific work of a certain department or factory or mine for a certain period of time, or to follow the person in charge of a certain department to inspect work and conduct special investigations and research.
    With the enrichment of teachers' practical knowledge and the gradual mastery of practical materials, we have emphasized that teachers should conscientiously study China's practical materials, combine the theories they have learned, systematize the practical materials, and gradually elevate them to the theoretical level, and cannot be satisfied with superficial understanding and stay at the level of one-sided connection with reality. In this case, our teachers have gradually increased Chinese materials in their lectures and lecture notes, analyzed relevant practical problems in national construction, thereby improving our teaching level.
    Over the past three years, we have adhered to the policy of combining political theory with business. Comrade Stalin said that industrial construction requires the training of two kinds of talents, namely "industrial commanding talents and engineering and technical talents." Renmin University of China mainly trains "industrial commanding talents" and other construction talents. This kind of industrial commanding talents and other construction talents "are the kind of talents who can understand our working class's policies, can understand this policy, and are determined to sincerely implement it." Therefore, we must combine business teaching and political theory teaching well. We stipulate in the teaching plan that "Marxism-Leninism," "Political Economy," and "History of the Chinese Revolution" are compulsory subjects for all students and graduate students, and some students and graduate students also have a special "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism" course. These political theory courses account for 20% of undergraduate courses and 30% of specialized courses. Facts have proved that this proportion is appropriate. Because we have systematically carried out the teaching of political theory, it is possible to enable everyone to improve their understanding of various business knowledge to the theoretical and policy level of Marxism-Leninism, rather than staying at the technical level. At the same time, we combine this political theory education with the Party's daily ideological work, especially the education of criticizing bourgeois ideology and policy education inside and outside the classroom. Our political theory teaching has achieved tremendous results. According to the graduates of the specialized courses, they not only understand the business, but also understand the basic theories and policies, and improve their ability to cope with emergencies.
    Over the past three years, we have adhered to the policy of focusing on cultivating worker-peasant intellectuals, especially industrial workers. Now, cadres and industrial workers in our students account for about 70% of the total number of people (educated youth account for about 30%). We believe that to absorb industrial workers and worker-peasant cadres to study, we must not only have a firm idea of serving workers and peasants, but also create various favorable conditions for worker-peasant learning. Because although workers and peasants have a high political consciousness and enthusiasm for learning, under the current circumstances, generally speaking, they have a lower level of education, difficult family life, are older, and have weaker bodies. To this end, we have established preparatory courses, and decided on the length of the remedial culture period according to their original cultural foundation and the majors they have learned. Guiding worker-peasant learning should grasp their own characteristics. They have a stronger understanding and more abundant experience in production struggle. We should make full use of these favorable conditions. In the teaching plan, add some basic courses such as Chinese language and mathematics, physics and chemistry, and teachers should adopt special and patient teaching methods to help them solve the difficulties in learning, so that they can study at the university. The worker-peasant cadre students who graduated this year meet the national requirements and specifications, and they have basically realized the slogan of "intellectualization of worker-peasant elements." We must fight against the view of despising workers and peasants, both opposing excessively lowering the admission standards when recruiting workers and peasants (which has the opposite effect); and opposing not creating conditions for worker-peasant learning and not solving their learning difficulties (which is actually refusing workers and peasants to enter university to study). Therefore, we must give appropriate solutions to the actual difficulties of workers and peasants in learning. In the past, some people wanted to reduce the living standards of worker-peasant cadres in schools and level them with intellectuals. The opinion that "there cannot be two kinds of treatment in a school" is wrong. In addition, we have a worker-peasant quick-success middle school attached to us to train outstanding worker-peasant elements to enter universities.
    Over the past three years, we have established a new set of teaching organizations, teaching systems, and teaching methods, which has ensured that our teaching quality is improving day by day. The main thing is to carry out teaching and scientific research work in a planned, led, and organized manner, which is fundamentally different from the liberalism, anarchism, and each doing its own thing teaching of the old-style universities. First of all, we implement comprehensive planning management. The whole school has formulated a unified teaching plan, and then the teaching and research office and other teaching organizations must formulate specific work plans according to the general plan, so that our work can be carried out in an orderly manner according to the plan; secondly, our teaching from lectures to self-study, tutoring, classroom discussions or exercises, production internships, tests or exams and other teaching links are not only closely linked and constitute a strict and systematic system, but also teachers are responsible for each teaching link, and the teacher responsibility system is implemented, which greatly improves the teaching effect; thirdly, we have a strict inspection system. The inspection of students' academic performance not only has tests or examinations at the end of the semester and academic year, but also pays attention to the usual inspections. For the inspection of teachers and teaching administrative work, we not only have planned lectures and inspections, but also established a set of scientific table reporting system, which is accurate, simple and easy to implement; finally, a strict labor discipline has been established. The attendance rate of students in class is generally above 97%. Most of the absences are due to sick leave or private leave, and there are almost no absentees. It is rare for teachers to be late for lectures, and there is no early departure. Generally, no leave is allowed for trivial matters. This strict labor discipline has become a habit for teachers and students in our school.
    (IV)
    Renmin University of China has been gradually developed over the past three years, and the education policy has been gradually implemented. After a large number of Soviet experts arrived at the school successively in the summer of 1950, we officially started school on September 1. However, Soviet consultants and Russian teachers had already arrived at the end of 1949, and we were actively preparing for ideological and organizational work. We concentrated a group of outstanding cadres from the Party and the state and asked them to humbly learn from experts and serve as the backbone of teaching. We established a Russian language brigade and a Russian language training class to train a large number of Russian language translators; at the same time, we organized the translation of Soviet materials on educational theory and higher education, such as "Higher Education." We called on cadres to learn from the Soviet Union and clearly stated that the experience of Soviet higher education institutions is the pointer for our school's school-running. Therefore, our development in the process of building the school is relatively smooth, and no chaotic phenomena have occurred. Although due to our lack of experience, the courses were heavier at the beginning, but with the help of Soviet experts, after active research and improvement, the courses were appropriately streamlined and quickly corrected. Due to the gradual improvement of the quality of teachers and the level of students, we now have the conditions to move forward one step further.
    The cultivation of our teaching strength is progressing simultaneously with the process of training students. At the beginning, we only had more than 50 teachers, which was far from meeting the needs of teaching. We adopted two methods to solve this difficult problem. One method is "learning while teaching," and the other method is to organize graduate students to study—both of these methods were needed at the time. However, with the improvement of teaching quality and the growth of teacher strength, the training of teachers must gradually transition to a more formal method so that they can get comprehensive and systematic improvement. In the training of teachers, the enthusiastic and selfless help of Soviet experts played an important role. In order to rationally and effectively exert the strength of experts, from the very beginning, we did not treat them as ordinary professors to give lectures to students, but as "working mother machines" to give lectures to teachers and graduate students. Over the past three years, the main strength of Soviet experts has been put on training teachers, graduate students, and compiling lecture notes. The reason why we can train a large number of teachers and publish a large number of teaching material reference materials today to lay the foundation for school-building is inseparable from this correct exertion of the strength of Soviet experts.
    Among the teachers and students in our school, there are basically no people who hold a skeptical, hesitant, or hostile attitude towards advanced Soviet experience. Therefore, our learning of advanced Soviet experience has never had the problem of whether or not to learn, but how to learn. The reason why our teachers and students have been on good terms with Soviet experts for the past three years, united and friendly, and humbly learning from them is inseparable from this ideological foundation. Although our cadres have the idea of serving the people, they lack systematic theoretical knowledge and scientific knowledge, and are accustomed to handicraft work methods for a long time and lack formal work methods, so learning advanced Soviet experience must gradually overcome our shortcomings or shortcomings in this regard. This is a process of struggle. At the same time, learning from Soviet experience must be honest, first of all to learn it thoroughly, truly understand and grasp its essence, and gradually solve practical problems. It is wrong to completely copy Soviet experience here, and it is also wrong to arbitrarily modify and distort Soviet experience. In order to effectively learn advanced Soviet experience, we must fight against these two erroneous and harmful ideas and tendencies. Learning advanced Soviet experience and profound scientific achievements is not an easy task.
    Although we have made certain achievements in the past three years, we have only initially learned a little bit of the way, and we are still far from mastering and being proficient in it. Not only do we dare not be proud and complacent, but we should sincerely, humbly, and redouble our efforts to learn, so as not to fail the tasks given to us by the Party and the government. Our school still has many shortcomings in both teaching and administration, and it cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the situation. It is hoped that the leading comrades of the Party and the government and comrades from all aspects will criticize and correct us at any time.

    中国人民大学三年来工作的基本总结
    吴玉章
    （一）
    中国人民大学是中华人民共和国成立后创办的新型正规大学。这个大学最早得到苏联专家直接的帮助，从制定教学计划、编写教学大纲与教材到规定教学组织、教学制度等，都认真地、系统地采取了苏联高等学校的先进经验和最新的科学成就。同时，我们还继承了老解放区为人民服务的和理论联系实际的革命教育的优良传统，我们的教学干部是以老干部为骨干带动和团结大批革命的进步的并经过思想改造的年青知识分子以及少数过去的旧大学的教学人员。这些老干部虽然有的文化水平较低，但是他们均有一定的实际斗争经验和马克思列宁主义的基础知识，比较容易了解党和国家的政策，他们和党与国家有着思想上、组织上、历史上长远的联系。我们培养的对象除了进步的青年学生以外，主要是培养产业工人和工农干部，他们曾经受过各种实际斗争的考验，有着实际斗争的经验。所有这些，都给我们接受苏联先进科学和先进工作经验以及将其与中国实际相结合上提供了极为有利的条件。我们的学员都是为完成党的任务而坚决地向科学进军，所以他们就不是为学习而学习，而是为国家建设而学习，这种学习很自然地就容易和实际联系起来。这就又为我们建校工作正确的和健全的发展提供了极为有利的条件。（二）
    中国人民大学三年来的教育工作是有成绩的。毕业学生四千五百八十七人，其中专修科三千九百九十六人，本科五百九十一人。今年在本科经济计划、统计、工厂管理、财政信用借贷、贸易、合作社等六系毕业学生四百四十三人，其中产业工人占百分之十二，革命干部占百分之六十，知识青年占百分之二十八；而其中党团员占百分之九十以上。这批毕业生成份及政治质量好，同时系统地学习了政治理论和各种专业知识，学有专长，从而就引起了各有关业务部门的重视。国家根据“学以致用”的原则将他们分配了工作，他们正在各工作岗位上为国家建设发挥了与发挥着重大的作用，许多人应用自己学到的知识和理论，提高和改进了工作。例如：我校专修科毕业学生，现任塘沽新港工程局第一修船厂厂长马金城、东北机械三厂副厂长车振国、中国人民银行西北区行划拨清算科科长萧煌等都曾经根据在校所学的“会计”、“统计”、“工业企业组织与计划”等专业课程结合中国具体情况，运用苏联先进经验改进了企业的组织管理，建立了新的会计制度，对工作起了决定性的良好的影响，受到各方面的赞许。这就基本上改变了旧中国高等教育数十年来“学非所用”，“用非所学”的教育脱离实际的传统毛病，并为新中国高等教育的建设树立了良好的榜样。    
    在全国高等学校改造的工作中，中国人民大学曾经给了有益的帮助。首先是帮助解决高等学校的教师，特别是政治理论课的教师问题。三年来从本校毕业的研究生有九百人，其中校外的五百四十八名，他们被分配到全国四十二个高等学校工作，在教学上一般地都受到学生的欢迎以及领导的重视；同时我们还抽调了教员和其他教学干部到其他高等学校工作，直接帮助建立教学组织，进行教学工作。其次，三年来我们不但陆续接待了全国各地高等学校来校参观者和他们交谈，赠送各种材料，利用文字较系统地向全国介绍了学习苏联的经验，而且还有计划地供给有关机关和学校的业务教材参考材料，以及较普遍地供给了政治理论教材和参考材料。据不完全统计：三年来供给各地业务教材、政治理论教材及参考材料一百余种，一百六十六万余册。最后，我们应京津部分高等学校及工业部门的邀请，曾经派不少政治理论教员和业务教员去讲课，据反映对各单位的政治理论学习和业务工作都有了不少的帮助。虽然如此，但是我们所进行的工作，对高等学校的需要说来，还是十分不够的，今后将尽一切可能继续加强这方面的工作。
    中国人民大学经过三年的努力，现在已有相当的规模。现在在校学生约五千人，另为全国高等学校培养研究生约二千人，校外函授学生二千七百人。如果说教学力量开始是薄弱的，那么，现在业已培养能够掌握某一门专业的教员约七百人，培养俄文翻译一百四十人，他们无论口译或笔译均达到一定的质量。三年来我们翻译教材一千三百余种，印八十九万余册，编写教材五百多种，印七十万二千九百十一册，这就能够使我们学生获得较多的学习资料。但是，客观情况迅速的发展，国家建设工作迅速的进步，要求我们在今后一定时期内不是继续在数量上大量发展，而是要在原有的基础上提高工作的质量，首先是提高领导骨干和教员的质量。因此，本校在上学年提出了巩固和提高的方针，然后在此基础上逐渐转向更加健全的发展的道路。（三）
    中国人民大学的这些成绩，就生动地证明了党中央和中央人民政府决定成立中国人民大学的方针是完全正确的。这些成绩的取得是由于党中央和中央人民政府的正确领导和经常关怀，由于中央各有关业务部门不断的指导和帮助，由于苏联专家热忱无私的援助和教诲以及全体干部的艰苦努力得来的。
    中央人民政府政务院曾经规定中国人民大学的教育方针是“教学与实际联系，苏联经验与中国情况相结合”，三年来我们执行了这一正确的教育方针。我们在领导思想上不但是强调系统地学习苏联先进的经验，而且还强调系统地和密切地注意中国各方面的实际问题，并从实际出发规定我们的教学计划，教学内容以及各种教学制度等。我们第一届教学计划是在苏联专家的直接帮助下，依据苏联有关各系教学计划为蓝本，并考虑到中国恢复时期的特点、学生和教员水平低的特点等制定的。第一届教学计划较苏联有关各系的教学计划减少了不急需的课程和时数，增加了在中国急需的课程；专业化的课程也没有苏联分的仔细；在教学大纲上也进行了必要的精减。随着我们国家建设的发展，学生和教员条件逐渐的变化，今年的教学计划就是比较更为全面地反映了客观的需要。在专业化的课程中又分专门化；在教学大纲和教材中逐渐反映了中国的材料。所以我们的教学计划与其说是开始时和苏联教学计划更靠近，不如说是现在和苏联教学计划更靠近更为正确些（当然现在的教学计划和苏联的教学计划还是有很大距离）。虽然开始由于缺乏经验，第一届教学计划在执行中，曾经发生课程较重的现象，但由于基本上是正确的，就很快得到了合理的纠正。苏联高等学校中规定生产实习是异常优越的制度。本校进行了两次大规模的生产实习，师生一致认为在理论联系实际上得到了巨大的收获。
    我们认为首先必须学习苏联的经验、学习理论，如果还不知道苏联的经验和理论是怎么一回事，就企图联系实际是不正确的，往往会弄出错误。但是随着教师对苏联经验和理论逐步的学得和掌握，就要系统地注意实际问题，对实际问题感到强烈的兴趣。因为不学习理论固不能对实际问题加以分析和说明，然而只学习理论不去研究实际问题，理论也是无法深入和无法学好的。我们为了在这一方面取得各部门的帮助，曾进行了一系列的工作，采取了有效的办法。还在一九五一年初，我们就请示中央批准由中央人民政府财政经济委员会通知所属各业务部门切实帮助解决这个问题，因此，我们与各业务部门直到厂矿的关系日益密切。起初是我们单纯要求帮助，主要是教学计划的修订、教学大纲与教材讲义的编写、科学研究等方面要求他们参与审阅，请他们作报告、供给材料与互相参加会议，这对于教学联系实际上是在经常起着作用的。以后逐渐发展由一般联系合同的形式进入科学合作：第一种是科学研究小组，即由教研室与业务部门指定一定负责人共同组织研究。第二种是企业管理训练班与生产实习相结合：例如我们在天津与市委工业部建立起极为广泛的联系，教员可以随时下厂搜集材料，同时给工厂解答问题，进行辅导。去年九月天津市委工业部组织企业管理训练班，主要是工厂厂长、车间主任、党委书记以上的在职干部一千六百余人进行业余学习，我们派教员王嘉谟讲课一学期，每周四小时，由于讲授内容切合他们的需要，提高和改进了他们的工作，因而受到他们的热烈欢迎。主要地是教员结合目前厂矿计划管理方面所存在的问题，运用苏联先进的经验进行系统的讲授，特别是讲授“技术组织措施计划”一课，更多地帮助了他们进行生产改革，加强计划管理。这样就把科学合作向前推进了一步。这是科学与生产结合的一种新形式，我们准备加以推广。第三种是派教员参加一定部门或厂矿一定时期的具体工作，或随同一定部门的负责人检查工作，进行专题的调查研究等。
    随着教员实际知识的丰富，对于实际材料逐步的掌握，我们曾经强调指出教员要认真研究中国的实际材料，结合已学到的理论，把实际材料系统化，逐步提升到理论上面来，而不能够满足于表面的了解，停留在片面的联系实际上面。在这种情况下，我们的教员在讲课和讲义中，都逐渐增加中国的材料，分析国家建设中有关的实际问题，从而就提高了我们的教学水平。
    三年来，我们坚持了政治理论与业务相结合的方针。斯大林同志说过，工业建设需要培养两种人材，即“工业指挥人材和工程技术人材”。中国人民大学主要是培养“工业指挥人材”及其他建设人材，这种工业指挥人材及其他建设人材“是能了解我国工人阶级底政策，能领会这个政策，并决意诚恳把它实现起来的那种人材”。因此，我们就必须把业务教学和政治理论教学很好地结合起来。我们在教学计划中规定“马克思列宁主义”、“政治经济学”和“中国革命史”为所有学生、研究生必修的科目，有的学生和研究生还有专门的“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”课程。这些政治理论课程本科占百分之二十，专修科占百分之三十，事实证明这种比例是适当的。由于我们系统地进行了政治理论的教学，就有可能使大家对各种业务知识的了解提高到马克思列宁主义的理论和政策水平上，而不是停留在技术的水平上。同时，我们把这种政治理论教育，与党的日常思想工作，尤其是在课堂内外进行批判资产阶级思想教育以及政策教育相互结合起来进行。我们的政治理论教学是收到了巨大效果的。据专修科毕业生反映，他们不但搞通了业务，而且了解了基本理论和政策，提高了应付事变的能力。
    三年来，我们坚持了以培养工农知识分子为主，尤其是产业工人的方针。现在我们学生中的干部与产业工人大体上占总人数百分之七十左右（知识青年占百分之三十左右），我们认为，要吸收产业工人、工农干部学习，不但要有坚定的为工农服务的思想，而且要为工农学习创造种种有利的条件。因为工农虽然政治觉悟高，有学习热情，但在目前情况下，一般说来文化程度较低，家庭生活困难，年纪较大，身体较弱。为此，我们曾经成立了预科，按其原有文化基础和专业所学情况决定补习文化期间的长短。指导工农学习，应该掌握他们本身的特点。他们理解力较强，有比较丰富的生产斗争的经验，我们应该充分利用他们这些有利的条件。在教学计划上加入一些国文及数学、理化等基础课程，教员要采取特殊的耐心的教学方法，帮助他们解决学习中的困难，这样他们是可以在大学学习的。我们今年毕业的工农干部学生是合于国家要求规格的，他们基本上已经实现了“工农分子知识化”的口号。我们必须与轻视工农的观点作斗争，既反对在吸收工农入学时过分降低入学的标准（这样其效果是适得其反的）；又要反对不为工农学习创造条件，不解决他们学习的困难（这样实际是拒绝工农入大学学习的），因此，对于工农学习中的实际困难，必须给予适当的解决。过去曾经有人要降低工农干部在学校内的生活待遇，把他们与知识分子拉平，所谓“一个学校内不能有两种待遇”的意见是错误的。此外，我们附设有工农速成中学，培养工农优秀分子升入大学。
    三年来，我们建立起了一套新的教学组织、教学制度和教学方法，从而就保证了我们的教学质量日益提高。主要是有计划、有领导、有组织地进行教学和科学研究工作，这与旧式高等学校的自由主义的、无政府状态的、各自为政的教学是根本不同的。首先，我们实行全面计划管理，全校制定了统一的教学计划，然后教研室以及其他教学组织都要根据总计划定出具体的工作计划，使我们的工作能够有条不紊地按计划进行；其次，我们的教学从讲授到自习、辅导、课堂讨论或练习、生产实习、测验或考试等各个教学环节不但是紧密联系的，构成了严密的和系统的体系，而且在各个教学环节上教员都要负责任，实行教员负责制，这就大大地提高了教学的效果；再其次，我们有严格的检查制度，对于学生学习成绩的检查不但有学期和学年终结的测验或考试，而且还注重平时的检查，对于教员和教学行政工作的检查，我们不但有计划地听课和巡视，而且建立了一套科学的表报制度，准确简便易行；最后，建立了严格的劳动纪律，学生上课出勤率一般在百分之九十七以上，缺勤的多为病假事假，旷课的几乎绝迹。教员讲课迟到是很少的，早退是没有的，一般的事情是不允许请假的。这种严格的劳动纪律本校师生已经成为习惯。（四）
      三年来中国人民大学是在逐步发展起来的，教育方针是逐步贯彻的。一九五○年暑假大批苏联专家陆续到校后，我们于九月一日正式开学。但在一九四九年末苏联顾问和俄文教员即已来到，我们就在思想上和组织上积极进行准备工作。我们集中了党和国家的一批优秀干部，要他们虚心向专家学习，作为教学的骨干。成立俄文大队，俄文专修班，大批培养俄文翻译人材；同时组织翻译苏联有关教育理论和高等学校方面的材料，如“高等学校”等。我们号召干部向苏联学习，明确提出苏联高等学校的经验就是我们学校办学的指针。因此，我们在建校过程中发展是比较顺利的，没有发生混乱的现象。虽然由于我们没有经验，开始时课程分量较重，但是在苏联专家帮助下，经过积极研究改进，对课程作了适当的精简，很快就得到了纠正。由于教员质量和学生程度的逐步提高，我们现在又有条件向前发展一步。
      我们教学力量的培养是与培养学生的过程同时并进的。在开始我们的教员只有五十多人，远远不能适应教学的需要。我们采取了两种办法解决这个困难问题，一种办法是“边学边教”，另一种办法是组织研究生学习——这两种办法在当时都是需要的。但是随着教学质量的提高，教员力量的生长，对于教员的培养就必须逐渐过渡到更为正规的办法，使他们得到全面的和系统的提高。在培养教员中，苏联专家热忱无私的帮助起了重要的作用。为了合理而有效地发挥专家力量，我们一开始就不是把他们当成普通的教授给学生讲课，而是把他们当成“工作的母机”给教员、研究生讲课。三年来苏联专家的主要力量是放在培养教员、研究生和编写讲义方面。我们今天之所以能够培养出大批教员和出版大量的教材参考资料，为建校打下基础，是和这种正确地发挥苏联专家的力量分不开的。
    在我们学校的师生中，对于苏联的先进经验持着怀疑、犹豫、敌视的态度者是根本没有的。因此，我们学习苏联的先进经验从不曾发生过是否应该学习的问题，而是如何学习的问题。我们师生三年来和苏联专家相处无间，团结友好，虚心向他们学习，是和这种思想基础分不开的。我们的干部虽有为人民服务的思想，但是缺乏系统的理论知识和科学知识以及长期习惯于手工业的工作方法，缺乏正规的工作方法，所以学习苏联的先进经验就必须逐渐克服我们这方面的不足或缺点。这是一个斗争的过程。同时，学习苏联经验必须是老老实实的，首先要把它学懂，真正领会和掌握其精神实质，逐步去解决实际问题。在这里完全照搬苏联的经验是错误的，随意修改和歪曲苏联的经验也是错误的。为着有效地学习苏联的先进经验，我们必须与这两种错误的、有害的思想和倾向作斗争。学习苏联先进经验和精深的科学成就不是轻而易举的事。
    三年来我们虽然有了一定的成绩，但是还只是初步地学得了一点门径，离掌握和精通的程度还很远，不仅不敢骄傲自满，而且应当诚恳、虚心、加倍努力学习，以不负党和政府给我们的任务。我们学校无论在教学方面和行政方面缺点还很多，赶不上形势发展的需要。希望党和政府的领导同志及各方面同志随时加以批评和指正。
