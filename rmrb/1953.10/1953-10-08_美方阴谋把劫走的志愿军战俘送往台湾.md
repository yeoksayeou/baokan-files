Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th – The US side is supporting and assisting the Li Cheng-man and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs in a conspiracy to forcibly send sixty Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, who were abducted from POW camps by the Li bandit gang in June this year, to Taiwan. According to an Associated Press report, a well-informed South Korean source said on the 5th that these POWs would soon be handed over to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. This person also said, "Plans are now being accelerated for these POWs to set sail."

As everyone knows, Clark had hypocritically stated that he would make efforts to recover our captured personnel who were forcibly detained by the Li bandit gang under the guise of "release." Now, this new conspiracy by the US side once again proves that Clark's words are complete lies to cover up their criminal conspiracy of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. The fact is that the US side has never taken and is fundamentally unwilling to take any practical measures to recover these POWs, and these POWs have always been forcibly detained by the Li Cheng-man and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs, making it entirely possible to recover all of them.

Sources here pointed out that General Nan Ri had already solemnly declared on July 19th that the US side bears the responsibility at all times to recover all 27,000 of our captured personnel forcibly detained by the Li Cheng-man bandit gang under the guise of "release" and hand them over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and to give us a clear explanation. The US side must send all our captured personnel still forcibly detained by the Li Cheng-man and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, so that they can freely exercise their right to be repatriated.

    美方阴谋把劫走的志愿军战俘送往台湾
   【新华社开城六日电】美方正在支持和协助李承晚和蒋介石匪帮，阴谋把在今年六月间被李匪帮从战俘营劫走的六十名中国人民志愿军被俘人员强迫送到台湾去。据美联社报道，一个南朝鲜消息灵通人士五日说，这些战俘不久将被移交给蒋匪帮。这个人还说，“现在正在加速实现这些战俘启程的计划。”
    大家知道，克拉克曾虚伪地表示将努力追回被李匪帮以“释放”为名强迫扣留的我方被俘人员。现在，美方这个新的阴谋再一次证明：克拉克的这些话，完全是掩盖其强迫扣留战俘罪恶阴谋的谎言。事实上是美方从来没有而且根本不愿意采取任何实际措施追回这些战俘，而这些战俘一直是被强迫扣留在李承晚和蒋介石匪帮手里，完全有可能把他们全部追回的。
    此间人士指出：我方南日大将在七月十九日早已严正声明：美方在任何时候都负有责任将李承晚匪帮以“释放”为名强迫扣留的二万七千名我方被俘人员全部追回交给中立国遣返委员会，并对我方作出明确交代。美方必须把所有仍为李承晚和蒋介石匪帮强迫扣留的我方被俘人员送交中立国遣返委员会，使得他们自由行使被遣返的权利。
