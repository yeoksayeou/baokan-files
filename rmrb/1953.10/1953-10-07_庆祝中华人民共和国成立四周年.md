The Chairman of the German Communist Party, Lehmann, Sends a Congratulatory Telegram to Chairman Mao

To Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China:

Dear Comrade Mao Zedong:

On the occasion of the Chinese National Day, the Central Committee of the German Communist Party and the peace-loving people of West Germany extend their heartfelt congratulations to you and the great Chinese people.

The people of West Germany are following with great concern the rapid development of the People's Republic of China since its liberation from imperialist enslavement four years ago. The great assistance of the Chinese people's sons and daughters in voluntarily assisting the Korean people in resisting imperialist aggression is also unforgettable. This contribution to restoring peace in the Far East is also an important contribution to maintaining world peace. It encourages the patriotic forces in West Germany to do their utmost to prevent the establishment of a new source of aggression on West German soil, and thus helps to ensure peace in Europe and the world.

While we are doing our utmost to strive for the reunification of our divided motherland on a democratic basis and to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, we are preventing the imperialist warmongers from provoking new wars.

We wish you personally, Comrade Mao Zedong, and the glorious Chinese Communist Party and all the Chinese people further great achievements in the peaceful construction of your country.

	Max Reimann, Chairman of the German Communist Party
	October 1, 1953, in Düsseldorf

  雷曼给毛主席的贺电中华人民共和国中央人民政府毛泽东主席亲爱的毛泽东同志：
    兹值中国国庆纪念，德国共产党中央和西德爱好和平的人民谨向您和伟大的中国人民表示衷心的祝贺。
    西德人民以极大的关怀注视着中华人民共和国自从四年以前从帝国主义奴役下解放出来后的飞速发展。中国人民的儿女志愿协助朝鲜人民抵抗帝国主义侵略的伟大援助亦令人难忘。这一恢复远东和平的贡献同时对于维护世界和平亦是一个重要的贡献。它鼓舞着西德的爱国力量，竭尽全力以制止在西德的土地上建立一个新的侵略策源地，并因而有助于确保欧洲和世界和平。
    在我们竭尽全力以争取在民主的基础上重新统一我们的分裂的祖国并缔结对德和约的同时，我们正在制止帝国主义战争贩子挑起新的战争。
    我们谨祝您本人，毛泽东同志，以及光荣的中国共产党和全体中国人民在贵国的和平建设中获得进一步伟大的成就。
