    Labor Models on the Study Front
    Zhu Yuming
    In the morning, as the bright sun rises in the east, neat rows of students are already standing on the playground of the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School affiliated with the Northeast Institute of Technology. The radio station broadcasts cheerful songs, and the students conscientiously do their exercises. Thus begins a day of learning.

    More than a thousand students study here, all of whom have been transferred from their work posts. Many of the students are production experts, including the nationally renowned industrial labor model Ma Hengchang, Tian Guiying, the first female train driver in New China, Su Changyou, the creator of the new bricklaying method, Zheng Xikun, the creator of the "Over-axle, 500-kilometer operation method," Du Xianyang, a Northeast Railway labor model and creator of the "Iron Ox" movement, and others.

    When the labor models stepped from factories, railways, and mines into the classroom, they encountered various difficulties in their studies. For them, everything they encountered in the classroom was unfamiliar and new. This was inevitable, because in the old society they were all exploited and oppressed working youth, and it was difficult to get the opportunity to go to school. Most of the students had only attended school for two or three years. A few students in language, didn't know many characters, and couldn't even write simple letters; in mathematics, they only knew simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Therefore, when they came into contact with subjects such as algebra, geometry, physics, and chemistry, they felt great difficulties.

    But they did not bow their heads in the face of these difficulties. Initially, some students could only understand part of what was taught in class, so they seized every minute of their study time after class, carefully reviewed, and conducted joint research; when they encountered problems that could not be solved, they asked the teacher. At the beginning, individual comrades' health was affected due to overwork. The school's Party organization and administrative leaders, in response to this situation, called on teachers to improve their teaching methods; and organized students in each class to hold discussion meetings, exchanging learning experiences with each other.

    After the teaching methods were improved, the students' academic performance and enthusiasm for learning were further enhanced. They were not only able to listen attentively in class, but also concentrated on reviewing during self-study time. The students demonstrated a spirit of unity and mutual assistance, and when they saw others in difficulty, they took the initiative to help them solve their problems. As a result, everyone made rapid progress in their studies. Take Tian Guiying, the first female train driver in New China and a national labor model, for example. When she first entered the school, she felt extremely difficult in arithmetic, but she was not discouraged. She overcame the difficulties in learning with a strong learning spirit. She often said, "I want to overcome the difficulties in learning with the spirit of driving a train, master scientific and technical knowledge, and make more contributions to the Party and the people in the future." Her progress in learning is very fast, especially in language and mathematics, where she has been able to maintain excellent grades.

    Su Changyou, the creator of the new bricklaying method, used to be a bricklayer apprentice. When he entered school in the winter of 1952, he had a very low level of education, only knew more than a thousand characters, and couldn't even do simple addition and subtraction in arithmetic. However, because Su Changyou promoted the spirit of diligent study, he achieved remarkable results in learning. He learned the phonetic symbols of the accelerated literacy method in just one day. At the beginning of the accelerated literacy learning, he set a plan to learn to write characters, wanting to increase from writing more than five hundred characters to one thousand five hundred characters. Completing this plan was relatively difficult for ordinary beginners, but due to his continuous efforts, he finally learned to write two thousand one hundred characters in ten days. After more than a month of study, he was able to read newspapers, and read more than a dozen simple political theory books and popular literary novels, and also wrote an autobiography of more than 10,000 words. In mathematics, he has now completed integers, decimals, and fractions. When learning area and volume calculation, he can relate to the calculation of bricklaying area and earth excavation, so he mastered the calculation method in just a few tens of minutes.

    Each student adopted a serious, down-to-earth, and humble attitude towards learning. If there were some small mistakes in exams or homework, they felt very sad, like making a defective product in production, and immediately corrected them. They attached great importance to the opinions given to them by teachers in exams and homework, collected them, and used them as their direction of effort. For example, Tong Junshan, a model young worker, when he first learned decimal addition and subtraction, he put the decimal point as a comma, the teacher wrote a few words on his exercise book, telling him the difference between the decimal point and the comma, he seriously practiced and corrected this shortcoming. They also closely combined the scientific knowledge learned in class with their own production experience. Zheng Xikun, the creator of the "Over-axle, 500-kilometer operation method," when studying the chapter on decimals, related it to the method of calculating turnover rate when driving a train in the past, so his academic performance improved rapidly, from three points at the beginning of school to five points. After learning "fractions," Wang Zhaoda, a national labor model, calculated the problem of matching and replacing gears.

    Our production models not only grasp cultural learning very tightly, but also attach great importance to political learning. Although study time is usually tight, in addition to regular classes, each person has read an average of more than ten political and literary books, including "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China", "On the Cultivation of Communists", "How to Be a Communist", "How Steel Was Tempered", "A Real Man", "Report When the Noose Was Around My Neck", "Lovely China", "The Hurricane" and so on. During reading, some students also wrote notes in conjunction with their own thoughts. The scores of political common sense classes generally reach four or five points.

    Although the students have made remarkable achievements in their studies, they are not complacent in the slightest. On the contrary, each student said that they will continue to overcome any difficulties in their studies with greater perseverance and determination. Wang Dianlin, a labor model from Anshan Iron and Steel Machinery Plant, wrote in his composition: "Now is just the beginning of learning. I have not learned enough, and I will definitely learn the scientific knowledge of electricity in the future, build power stations for the construction of the motherland, and send electricity to every corner of the motherland!"

    在学习战线上的劳动模范们
    朱钰铭
    早晨，当东方刚升起灿烂的朝阳的时候，在东北工学院附设工农速成中学的操场上已站满了整齐的行列。广播站播送着愉快的歌曲，同学们认真地做着体操。一天的学习生活便开始了。
    在这里学习的有一千多名同学，他们都是由工作岗位上调来的。同学中很多是生产中的能手，其中有闻名全国的工业劳动模范马恒昌，新中国第一个女火车司机田桂英，新砌砖法创造者苏长有，
    “超轴、五百公里作业法”创造者郑锡坤，东北铁路劳动模范、“铁牛”运动创造者杜先扬等。
    当劳动模范们从工厂、铁路、矿山走进课堂的时候，在学习上曾遇到了种种的困难。对于他们说来，在课堂上碰到的东西都是生疏的、新鲜的。这也是必然的，因为他们在旧社会里都是受尽剥削和压迫的劳动青年，很难得到上学的机会，大部分同学只念过两三年书。少数同学在语文方面，认识的字不多，连简单的信也写不好；在数学方面，只会简单的加减乘除。因此，当他们一接触到代数、几何、物理、化学等课的时候，便感到很大的困难。
    但是他们并没有在重重的困难面前低头。起初，在课堂上有些同学往往只能听懂一部分，他们就在课后抓紧每一分钟的学习时间，细心地复习，共同进行研究；遇到不能解决的问题，就去问老师。在开始时因用功过度，个别同志的身体健康受到了影响。学校党组织和行政领导方面，曾针对这种情况号召教师改进教学方法；组织各班同学开座谈会，相互交流了学习经验。
    教学方法得到改进后，同学们的学习成绩和学习积极性更加提高了。他们不仅能在上课时聚精会神地听讲，在自习时间也是全神贯注地来进行复习。同学们发挥了团结互助的精神，看到别人有困难时，就主动地帮助对方解决困难问题。因此，大家在学习上进步都很快。就拿新中国第一个女火车司机、全国劳动模范田桂英来说吧。她刚进学校时，在算术方面感到极大的困难，但是她并没有灰心。她以坚强的学习精神克服了学习中的困难。她常常说：“我要以学习开火车的精神来克服学习中的困难，掌握科学技术知识，将来为党为人民作出更多的工作。”她在学习上的进步是非常快的，特别是语文和数学，她已能保持优等的成绩。
    新砌砖法创造者苏长有，过去曾当过瓦匠学徒。他在一九五二年冬天入学时，文化程度很低，只能认识一千多个字，算术连简单的加减法也不会。但由于苏长有在学习中发扬了努力钻研的精神，学习上获得了显著的成绩，他仅仅用一天的时间就学会了速成识字法的拼音符号。在速成识字学习开始时，他订了一个学写字的计划，要在写五百多字的基础上提高到一千五百字。要完成这个计划对一般初学写字的人来说是比较困难的，但由于他的不断努力终于在十天内写会了二千一百个字。经过了一个多月的学习，他已能看报纸了，并阅读了十多本浅近的政治理论书籍和通俗的文艺小说，还写了一篇长达一万多字的自传。在数学上，他现在已学完了整数、小数、分数。在学面积和体积计算时，他能联系砌砖面积和挖土方的计算，因此仅花几十分钟的时间就掌握了演算的方法。
    每个同学对学习采取了认真、踏实和虚心的态度，如果在考试或作业中有了一些小错误，就像在生产中做出了一件废品，感到很难过，立即加以改正。他们非常重视教师平时在考试和作业中给他们提出的意见，把它收集起来，作为自己的努力方向。如模范青年工人佟俊山，刚学小数加减法的时候，他把小数点点成逗点，教师在他习题本上批了几句话，告诉他小数点和逗点的区别，他就认真地练习，改正了这个缺点。他们还把课堂上学得的科学知识和自己的生产经验密切结合起来。“超轴、五百公里作业法”创造者郑锡坤在学小数这一章时，联系到过去开火车时计算周转率的方法，因而学习成绩得到了迅速的提高，由入学时的三分提高到五分。全国劳动模范王兆达学完“分数”之后，就计算配换齿轮的问题。
    我们的生产模范们不仅对文化学习抓的很紧，对政治学习也很重视。平时学习时间虽然紧，但在正课以外，每人平均都阅读了十本以上的政治、文艺书籍，其中有“中国共产党的三十年”、“论共产党员的修养”、“怎样做一个共产党员”、“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“真正的人”、“绞索套着脖子时的报告”、“可爱的中国”、“暴风骤雨”等。在阅读中，有的同学还结合着自己的思想写了笔记。政治常识课成绩一般都达到四分、五分。
    同学们虽然在学习上已取得了显著的成绩，但他们丝毫没有自满的情绪，相反地，每个同学都表示要以更大的毅力和决心来继续克服学习中的任何困难。鞍钢机械厂劳动模范王殿林同学在他的作文中曾这样写道：“现在只不过是学习的开始。我学习得还很不够，今后一定学好电气这门科学知识，为祖国建设发电站，把电送到祖国的各个角落里去！”
