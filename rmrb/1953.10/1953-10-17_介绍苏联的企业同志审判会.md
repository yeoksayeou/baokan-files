    Introducing the Soviet Enterprise Comrades' Court
    Yuǎn Guāng
    Shortly after the establishment of the Soviet regime, the Soviet Union had the organization of Comrades' Courts. The establishment of this system is one of the important forms for the Soviet state to realize the democratization of judicial work and attract the broad masses of working people to participate in judicial trials. The victory of the great October Socialist Revolution overthrew the old Russian Tsarist system and the rule of landlords and capitalists, and the power was transferred to the working class. Under this new situation, it is necessary to educate the people with the proletarian dictatorship and socialist ideas, and to fight against the bourgeois ideas remaining in people's consciousness. Comrade Stalin once said in his summary of the Thirteenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "One of the major tasks of the Party during the period of the proletarian dictatorship is to carry out the work of transforming the old generation and educating the new generation in the spirit of the proletarian dictatorship and socialism. The old habits, customs, traditions, and prejudices left over from the old society are the most dangerous enemies of socialism. These traditions and habits control millions of working people. Sometimes they shroud all strata of the proletariat, and sometimes they pose a great danger to the existence of the proletarian dictatorship itself. Therefore, we must fight against these traditions and habits, we must overcome them in all aspects of our work, and educate the new generation in the spirit of proletarian socialism. All this is the current task of our Party. Without carrying out these tasks, socialism cannot be victorious." (Stalin's Complete Works, Volume 6, page 248) This cause of educating people in the socialist spirit, in addition to being realized by the Soviet Communist Party and the cultural and educational organs under its leadership and the Soviet courts, the Comrades' Court also plays a certain role. The difference between the Comrades' Court and the Soviet court is that it uses another form to give play to the strength of the masses themselves, cultivate the discipline and consciousness of the masses, and overcome various bad consciousness and bad behaviors of the people. Therefore, it occupies an important position in the entire social transformation process.
    The Comrades' Court is not a state trial organ, but a mass self-education organization. Its organization, tasks, and working methods are different from those of the state court. Organizationally speaking, the enterprise Comrades' Court is elected by the enterprise workers' congress and generally has five to seven members. Its work is under the leadership of the local trade union, and the local people's court has the responsibility to help its work and provide guidance according to its rights and obligations. Therefore, the enterprise Comrades' Court coexists with the state court system. Its main task is to consolidate labor discipline and promote production. Its working methods are mass education and persuasion methods, rather than sanctions by state organs against lawbreakers.
    The prototype of the modern enterprise Comrades' Court, the so-called "Workers' Discipline Comrades' Court," was founded in 1919, and was first implemented in factories and enterprises in Moscow, Petrograd, and many other large cities. The resolution "Regarding the Comrades' Courts of Factories, Workshops, State Organs, and Social Organizations" promulgated by the Central Executive Committee and the People's Committee of the Russian Republic on August 27, 1928, stipulated the tasks and powers of the Comrades' Courts, restricting the Comrades' Courts to only deal with cases of bullying, abuse, and insults in life that occur between staff or workers in the same agency or the same enterprise. By 1929, in order to cooperate with the country's first five-year construction plan, the work of the Comrades' Courts was advanced, focusing on dealing with production issues and production discipline issues. At the beginning of 1931, the Soviet government summarized the experience of planned construction and implemented a series of measures in enterprises and institutions to strengthen labor discipline, including the Central Executive Committee and the People's Committee's decision on improving the enterprise Comrades' Courts. This decision stipulates that the enterprise Comrades' Courts should actively implement the education of production discipline and fight against behaviors that undermine production and similar behaviors, in order to ensure the victorious completion of industrial and financial plans. At the same time, it also stipulates that the enterprise Comrades' Courts can also handle minor theft cases of less than 50 rubles, minor property disputes, as well as rogue behaviors and assault and insult cases that do not constitute criminal responsibility. In terms of sanctions, in addition to warnings, public reprimands, and suggestions to the administration to remove from office, it is also stipulated that minor fines (less than 10 rubles) can be imposed, and suggestions can be made to the trade union to expel union membership. After the end of the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet government, based on the new situation and needs, promulgated the "Regulations on Comrades' Courts of Enterprises and Institutions," focusing the activities of the Comrades' Courts on helping to educate the staff in enterprises and institutions to consciously abide by labor discipline, cultivate their high sense of responsibility for completing tasks, and correctly and timely implement state orders and instructions; some amendments have also been made to the sanction methods, the purpose of which is to enable the Comrades' Courts of enterprises and institutions to play a greater role in promoting production and ensuring the completion of tasks.
    According to the "Regulations on Comrades' Courts of Enterprises and Institutions," the Comrades' Courts are responsible for handling the following cases: absenteeism without justifiable reasons; lateness or early departure; drunkenness at work; failure to execute the orders or instructions of superiors; treating one's duties with a disloyal attitude, resulting in defective products or work stoppages; treating the property of the enterprise or institution with negligence; violating technical safety equipment regulations and other labor discipline regulations.
    The Comrades' Court handles the above-mentioned cases only if they do not constitute a criminal offense. Whether a case is handled by the Comrades' Court is decided by the leaders of the enterprise or institution. Before handling a case, the Comrades' Court should conduct investigation and research on the case; during the trial, it should listen to the explanations of the accused and witnesses, and other attendees also have the right to speak. The verdict of the Comrades' Court shall be passed by the members by ordinary majority vote. If it is considered that the evidence is insufficient, the accused can also be sentenced to no punishment. The verdict must be in written form and announced by order of the leaders of the enterprise or institution, and can also be announced on the bulletin board if necessary. The verdict of the Comrades' Court is the final decision and may not be appealed; if the Comrades' Court violates the case-handling regulations, the leaders of the enterprise or institution have the right to suggest that the Comrades' Court re-handle the case.
    The enterprise or institution Comrades' Court may adopt the following sanctions: First, announce a public warning; second, announce a public condemnation; third, make a proposal to the leaders of the enterprise or institution regarding demotion, downgrading, or removal from office; fourth, make a proposal to the leaders of the enterprise or institution to transfer the relevant criminal responsibility materials to the investigation or trial organs.
    In addition to the above-mentioned enterprise or institution Comrades' Courts, the Soviet Union also has collective farm Comrades' Courts, residential Comrades' Courts, etc. The organizational procedures, rights, and obligations of these Comrades' Courts are generally similar to those of enterprise or institution Comrades' Courts.
    The Comrades' Court is an advanced system in the Soviet Union that combines judicial trial work and education work. The Soviet enterprise Comrades' Court has made great achievements in giving play to the strength of the masses, using comradeship and education methods to eliminate the remnants of bourgeois ideology, consolidate the labor discipline of enterprises, and promote production. Today, our country has entered a period of planned economic construction. Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and gradually establishing Comrades' Courts in our state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in a focused manner is of great significance for educating the masses of employees to be loyal to the motherland, abide by labor discipline, and cherish state property. Because our experience in this area is still very immature, we must adopt a cautious and steady approach when establishing Comrades' Courts, and first conduct pilot projects in state-owned enterprises with strong leadership, and then gradually promote them after gaining experience.

    介绍苏联的企业同志审判会
    远光
    在苏维埃政权成立后不久，苏联就有了同志审判会的组织。这一制度的建立，是苏维埃国家实现司法工作民主化，吸引广大劳动人民参加司法审判的重要形式之一。伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，推翻了旧俄罗斯沙皇制度和地主、资本家的统治，政权转入工人阶级的手中。在这种新的形势下，必须以无产阶级专政和社会主义的思想来教育人民，和人们意识中残存的资产阶级思想作斗争。斯大林同志在关于俄国共产党（布）第十三次代表大会的总结里曾说过：“党在无产阶级专政时期的重大任务之一，就是开展以无产阶级专政和社会主义的精神改造老一代和教育新一代的工作。旧社会遗留下来的旧的习气、习惯、传统、偏见，是社会主义最危险的敌人。这些传统和习气控制着千百万劳动群众。有时笼罩着无产阶级各阶层，有时对无产阶级专政的存在本身造成极大的危险。因此，必须同这些传统习气作斗争，必须在我们各方面的工作中克服它们，以无产阶级社会主义精神教育新的一代，这一切，就是我们党的当前任务，不执行这些任务，社会主义就不能取得胜利。”（斯大林全集第六卷第二四八页）这种以社会主义精神教育人们的事业，除了苏联共产党和在它领导下的文化教育机关及苏维埃法院来实现外，同志审判会也起着一定的作用。同志审判会和苏维埃法院的区别，是它运用另外一种形式，发挥群众自己的力量，培养群众的纪律性和自觉性，克服人们的各种不良意识与不良行为。因此，在整个社会改造过程中，它占着重要的地位。
    同志审判会不是国家的审判机关，而是一种群众性的自我教育的组织。它的组织、任务与工作方式、方法，都和国家法院有所不同。从组织上说，企业同志审判会，是由企业职工大会选举产生的，一般有委员五人至七人。它的工作受地方职工会的领导，地方人民法院有责任对它的工作进行帮助，并根据它的权利与义务给予指导，因此，企业同志审判会是和国家法院系统同时并存的；它的任务主要放在巩固劳动纪律和推动生产上；它的工作方式、方法是一种群众性的教育感化的方法，而不是国家机关对于违法分子的制裁。
    现代企业同志审判会的雏型，即所谓“工人纪律同志审判会”，创始于一九一九年，最初是在莫斯科、彼得格勒和其他许多大城市的工厂企业中开始实行的。一九二八年八月二十七日俄罗斯共和国中央执行委员会与人民委员会公布的“关于工厂、作坊、国家机关和社会团体同志审判会”的决议，对同志审判会的任务与职权作了规定，限制同志审判会仅处理在同一机关或同一企业的职员或工人间所发生的关于欺凌、虐待、侮辱等生活上的案件。到一九二九年，为了配合国家第一个五年建设计划，同志审判会的工作，向前推进了一步，重点放在处理生产问题与生产纪律问题。一九三一年初，苏联政府总结了计划建设的经验，在企业及机关中实行了一系列的关于加强劳动纪律的措施，其中包括中央执行委员会与人民委员会关于改进企业同志审判会的决定。这个决定规定，企业同志审判会应积极地贯彻生产纪律的教育，和破坏生产以及类似的行为作斗争，以保证工业、财政计划的胜利完成。同时还规定企业同志审判会也可以处理五十卢布以下的轻微偷窃案件、轻微财产纠纷，以及不构成刑事责任的无赖行为和殴打、侮辱案件等。在制裁方法上，除了警告，公开申斥，向行政上提出免职的建议外，并规定可采取轻微罚金（十卢布以下的），向职工会提出开除工会会籍的建议。伟大的卫国战争结束后，苏联政府又根据新的情况与需要，颁布了“企业与机关同志审判会条例”，把同志审判会的活动集中在帮助教育企业与机关中的工作人员自觉地遵守劳动纪律，培养他们完成任务的高度责任心，正确和及时地执行国家的命令与指示等；在制裁方法上也作了一些修改，目的是使企业与机关的同志审判会，在推动生产与保证任务的完成上发挥更大的作用。
    根据“企业与机关同志审判会条例”规定，同志审判会负责处理以下案件：关于无正当原因的旷工；迟到或早退；在工作时醉酒；不执行首长的命令或指示；以不忠实的态度对待自己的职务，因而产生废品或停工现象；以玩忽态度对待企业或机关的财产；违反技术安全设备规章及其他劳动纪律等案件。
    同志审判会处理上述案件，以不构成刑事犯罪者为限。一个案件是否交由同志审判会处理，由该企业或机关的领导人决定。同志审判会在处理案件以前，应对案件进行调查研究；在审理时应听取被审人与证人的说明，其他列席人亦有发言权。同志审判会的判决，由委员依照普通多数表决通过，如认为证据不足时，亦可判决被审人不受处罚。判决书必须采取书面方式，以企业或机关领导人的命令公布，必要时也可在壁报上公布。同志审判会的判决为最终决定，不得表示不服；同志审判会如违反办案规章，企业或机关的领导人，有权建议同志审判会重新处理。
    企业或机关同志审判会，可以采用下列制裁方法：第一、宣布公开警告；第二、宣布公开谴责；第三、向企业或机关领导人提出关于降职、降级或免职的建议；第四、向企业或机关领导人提出移送侦查机关或审判机关的有关刑事责任的材料。
    苏联的同志审判会，除上述企业或机关同志审判会外，并有集体农庄同志审判会、住宅同志审判会等。这些同志审判会的组织程序、权利和义务，与企业或机关同志审判会大体相似。
    同志审判会是苏联人民司法审判工作与教育工作相结合的一种先进制度。苏联的企业同志审判会在发挥群众的力量，用同志感化教育的方法肃清资产阶级思想意识的残余，巩固企业的劳动纪律和推动生产上，已作出了很大成绩。今天，我们的国家已进入了有计划的经济建设的时期，学习苏联的这一先进的经验，在我们的国营工矿企业中，逐步地有重点地建立起同志审判会，这对于教育职工群众忠于祖国、遵守劳动纪律、爱护国家财产等，是有重大意义的。由于目前我们在这方面的经验还很不成熟，在建立同志审判会时，必须采取慎重、稳步前进的方针，有重点地先在领导较强的国营企业中试行，等到取得经验后，再逐步推广。
