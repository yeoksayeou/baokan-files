The Central Ministry of Internal Affairs recently issued instructions on strengthening production for self-relief and practicing economy to overcome famine in disaster areas.

The instructions stated: Since the beginning of summer, some areas have suffered from floods, as well as varying degrees of drought, insect pests, and hail, which have not only reduced the yields of summer and autumn crops but also caused significant damage to houses, farming tools, and furniture in flood-stricken areas. To smoothly overcome the disaster, all affected areas must actively lead the masses to carry out production for self-relief, while also vigorously promoting economical ways to survive the famine and strictly controlling the use of relief grain and funds. However, some disaster areas lack the necessary attention to economical means of survival, and in the relief work, they do not carefully budget, blindly and indiscriminately distribute relief grain and funds, which not only wastes relief grain and funds but also fosters the dependent mentality of the disaster victims.

The instructions pointed out: The people's governments in all disaster areas must strictly control relief grain and funds and focus them on the most severely affected areas and the most urgent needs. Now that the disaster situation has been largely determined, all localities should still combine the autumn harvest with verifying the disaster situation and formulate comprehensive winter production and economy plans as early as possible. In flood-stricken areas, housing repairs should be simple and practical, using old materials, mobilizing the masses to help each other, and gradually repairing houses themselves; for a small number of disaster-stricken households whose houses have completely or mostly collapsed, who are unable to repair them, and who are unable to repay loans, relief funds may be used to solve the problem as appropriate. The distribution of relief funds should be based on the different difficulties of the disaster victims, treating them differently, avoiding waste, and preventing the tendency of failing to provide assistance when it is needed. The work of overcoming famine in disaster areas mainly lies in finding a way out through production, increasing income from various sources, and accumulating strength to overcome the famine. Currently, while actively carrying out the autumn harvest and autumn planting, appropriate planting of early-maturing crops should be carried out; a large amount of substitute food should be collected, and in addition to being mixed with other foods, it should also be dried and stored. In areas where autumn vegetables can be grown, the season should be seized and planting should be carried out in a timely manner. Cadres in disaster areas must strengthen their leadership over sideline production. First of all, they must help disaster victims formulate production and famine relief plans, and specifically organize disaster-stricken households with difficulties in production and self-relief, so that labor and capital, technology and tools are well combined, and mutual assistance production is carried out on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit. All localities should seize the opportunity to develop sideline and handicraft production with conditions and sales channels, organize various transportation activities, actively work throughout the winter, and strive for each disaster-stricken household to have certain savings or save autumn harvest grain, which can be reserved for spring famine relief rations or spring planting seeds. Commercial, cooperative, and other departments should provide specific assistance to the production of disaster victims, so as to open up sales channels and enable the sideline production in disaster areas to be carried out in a planned manner. In addition, active steps should be taken to practice economy and avoid waste. The people's governments in disaster areas should universally and deeply conduct propaganda and education to make cadres and the masses realize the importance of economy; and pay attention to commending models of active production and practicing economy, criticizing those who are lazy in production and arbitrarily wasteful, and establishing a good atmosphere of economy. Many disaster areas have proposed "using vegetables instead of rice, thin porridge instead of thick, and miscellaneous grains instead of staple foods, changing three meals to two meals"; "preparing vegetables in slack times for busy times, being busy at times for times of scarcity"; "no gifts, no banquets, no buying superstitious items, and striving to save money during the New Year and festivals"; "reducing winemaking and sugar boiling, and using substitutes as raw materials." These experiences should be discovered and promoted in a timely manner. The various wasteful phenomena that exist in disaster areas should be addressed by taking different measures according to different situations, striving to change them: lazy people and loafers should be strictly supervised in their production; gambling should be strictly prohibited; and the wasteful phenomena caused by certain old social customs and superstitious behaviors should be gradually overcome through persuasion and education.

### 中央内务部指示灾区加强生产自救工作

    中央内务部指示灾区加强生产自救工作
    中央人民政府内务部最近发出关于加强灾区生产自救节约渡荒工作的指示。
    指示说：入夏以来，部分地区遭受水灾，以及不同程度的旱、虫、雹等灾，不仅夏秋两季作物因灾减产，而且水灾地区群众的房屋、农具家具等，亦受不少损失。为顺利渡过灾荒，受灾各地一面要积极领导群众开展生产自救运动，一面必须大力提倡节约渡荒与切实控制救济粮款的使用。但有些灾区对节约渡荒缺乏应有的重视，在救灾工作中不知精打细算，盲目滥发救济粮款，既浪费了救济粮款，又助长了灾民的依赖思想。
    指示指出：各灾区的人民政府对救济粮款，必须切实加以控制，有重点地投放在重灾区和最迫切需要的方面。目下灾情已大体确定，各地仍应结合秋征核实灾情，及早制订全面的冬季生产节约渡荒计划。水灾地区在房屋修缮上，应该是因陋就简，利用旧料，发动群众帮工互助，自行逐步修复；对房屋全部或大部倒塌、无力修建、贷款又无力偿还的少数灾户，可以救济款酌情解决。救济款的发放，要根据灾民不同的困难，分别对待，既要避免浪费，又要防止该救不救的偏向。灾区的渡荒工作，主要是在生产上找出路，从多方面增加收入，积蓄渡荒力量。目前在积极进行秋收秋种工作中，要适当播种早熟作物；大量收集代食品，除掺食外，还要晒干储藏。能种秋菜的地区，要抓紧季节，及时播种。灾区的干部必须加强对副业生产的领导。首先要帮助灾民订立生产渡荒计划，并把生产自救有困难的灾户，具体组织起来，使劳力与资金、技术与工具很好结合，在自愿互利的原则下进行互助生产。各地应抓紧开展有条件有销路的副业、手工业生产，组织各种运输，积极地活动一冬，争取每一灾户都有一定积蓄或省下秋收粮食，留作明春渡荒口粮或春种种子。商业、合作等部门应对灾民的生产作具体协助，以便打开销路，使灾区的副业能够有计划地进行。此外，还应采取积极步骤，厉行节约，避免浪费。灾区的人民政府应普遍深入地进行宣传教育，使干部和群众认识节约的重要性；并注意表扬积极生产、厉行节约的模范，批判生产怠惰、任意浪费的分子，树立良好的节约风气。不少灾区提出“以菜代饭、以稀代干，以杂粮代主粮，三餐改两餐”；“闲时准备忙时菜，有时应为无时忙”，“不送礼、不请酒、不买迷信品、过年过节力求省钱”；“减少酿酒、熬糖，并以代用品作原料”。对这些经验，应及时发现，加以推广。灾区现有的各种浪费现象，要分别不同情况，采取不同措施，力求改变：对懒汉、二流子要严格监督其生产；对赌博现象，要严加禁止；对社会的某些旧习俗及迷信行为所造成的浪费现象，要通过说服教育，逐步克服。
