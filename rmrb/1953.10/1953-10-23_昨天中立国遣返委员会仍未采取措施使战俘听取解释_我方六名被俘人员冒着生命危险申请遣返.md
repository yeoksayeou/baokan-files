Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 22nd: Today is the fourth day since the explanation work was interrupted. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces still state that they are unable to bring any POWs of the Korean People's Army from any camp to the explanation site to listen to explanations. The facts show that if the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces do not take effective measures to break the US special agents' reign of terror, the explanation work stipulated in the "Terms of Reference" and "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work" will not be carried out.

According to reports from our civil police in the northern part of the demilitarized zone, US military aircraft have been circling over the Neutral Nations Custodial Camps every day. On the night of the 21st, US aircraft circled for as long as half an hour. This action by the US is clearly intended to embolden the Li and Chiang special agents mixed into the Neutral Nations Custodial Camps and to threaten our captured personnel.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 22nd: The explanation work on the Korean and Chinese side will still not be restored on the 23rd. On the evening of the 22nd, the Korean and Chinese side received a notice from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission stating that POWs of the Korean People's Army still cannot leave the camp on the 23rd to receive explanations.

The Korean and Chinese side received another notice at almost the same time stating that three POWs of the Korean People's Army and three POWs of the Chinese People's Volunteers will be repatriated on the 23rd. This is the second group of captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese side applying for repatriation after the US and Li-Chiang special agents interrupted the explanation work. On the 19th, five POWs of the Korean People's Army had already returned. The first group of returning POWs of the Korean People's Army after the suspension of explanation work unanimously pointed out that the POWs urgently expect to have the opportunity to listen to explanations. As long as the Indian troops take effective action to enter the camps, the POWs can be brought out to listen to the explanations. The fact that another six POWs of the Korean and Chinese side risked their lives to apply for repatriation once again proves how absurd the claim that the POWs "refuse" to listen to explanations is, and proves how eagerly the POWs expect to listen to explanations in order to exercise their right to be repatriated.

However, since the 16th, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces have not taken the effective actions expected by the POWs, but instead have tried to "persuade" the special agents mixed among the POWs to allow the POWs to leave the camps to listen to explanations. According to a report from Panmunjom by the US Associated Press on the 22nd, someone is still trying to "persuade" the special agents to meet with the explanation personnel, but the special agents are asking for "more time" to make a decision. This "persuasion" method has already delayed the explanation work for POWs of the Korean People's Army for six days. The facts of the past six days fully prove that "persuading" the special agents who are carrying out the US anti-explanation plan will only cause the explanation work to continue to be delayed and obstructed, and the special agents will gain ample time to intensify their activities to sabotage the explanation work in order to prevent POWs from applying for repatriation.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 22nd: The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission decided on the 22nd that the application for repatriation of a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army was valid. This volunteer was the one who, according to the US Associated Press, had stated at least seventeen times that he "refused repatriation" during the explanation on the 17th. He himself applied to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for repatriation on the 22nd, requesting to return to the motherland. This fact powerfully refutes the protest made by Hamblen, the head of the US "repatriation group," to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Hamblen had stubbornly insisted in his protest that the explanation representative of the Korean and Chinese side "most seriously violated the principle of freedom from coercion." This fact also thoroughly exposes the lie fabricated by the US Information Service that the Korean and Chinese side "intimidated" the POWs to apply for repatriation.

In fact, the intimidation and threats came precisely from the US observer representatives and the Chiang Kai-shek special agents who appeared in the explanation tents in the name of "detaining party representatives" and translators. When this volunteer was listening to the explanation on the afternoon of the 17th, the US observer representatives and the Chiang bandit special agents disregarded the repeated prohibitions of the Indian chairman of the subsidiary body of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, shouting and publicly threatening this POW not to apply for repatriation, and rudely insulted the Polish personnel of the Neutral Nations, making it impossible for the explanation work to continue. General Thimayya, the chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, arrived at the time and took this captured soldier of the Volunteer Army away and isolated him in the Indian Custodial Forces' own hospital for six days. At the meeting of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 22nd, this captured soldier of the Volunteer Army requested repatriation to return to the motherland. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, based on Article 9 of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work" which states that "POWs can apply for repatriation at any time and at any place," decided on the spot that his application for repatriation was valid.

This captured soldier of the Volunteer Army will return to the embrace of the motherland at 11:00 a.m. on the 23rd together with the other five captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese side.

### 昨天中立国遣返委员会仍未采取措施使战俘听取解释  我方六名被俘人员冒着生命危险申请遣返

    昨天中立国遣返委员会仍未采取措施使战俘听取解释
    我方六名被俘人员冒着生命危险申请遣返
    【新华社开城二十二日电】今天是解释工作中断以来的第四天，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队仍然表示无法把任何一个营场的朝鲜人民军被俘人员带到解释场所去听取解释。事实表明：如果中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队不采取有效措施打破美方特务的恐怖统治，“职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”所规定的解释工作将无法进行。
    据非军事区北部我方民政警察报告：美方军用飞机天天在中立国看管营场一带上空盘旋。二十一日夜里，美方飞机竟盘旋飞行达半小时之久。美方的这种行动，显然在于给混入中立国看管营场的李蒋特务助威壮胆，和对我方被俘人员进行威胁。
    【新华社开城二十二日电】朝中方面的解释工作二十三日仍然不能恢复。二十二日晚朝中方面接到中立国遣返委员会的通知说，朝鲜人民军被俘人员二十三日仍不能出营场来接受解释。
    朝中方面差不多同时接到另一个通知说，二十三日有三名朝鲜人民军被俘人员和三名中国人民志愿军被俘人员将被遣返，这是在美方和李、蒋特务使解释工作中断以后第二批申请遣返的朝中被俘人员。十九日已有五名朝鲜人民军被俘人员遣返归来。在解释工作停顿后第一批归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员一致指出，战俘们迫切地期待得到听取解释的机会，只要印度部队采取有效行动进入营场，战俘们就能够被带出来听解释。又有六名朝中被俘人员冒着生命危险申请遣返的事实，再次证明了所谓战俘们“拒绝”听取解释的说法是多么荒谬，证明了战俘们是多么殷切地期待听取解释，以便行使他们被遣返的权利。
    但是，从十六日以来，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队并未采取为战俘们所期待的有效行动，反而试图“说服”混在战俘中的特务分子让战俘出营场来听取解释。据美国合众社二十二日从板门店报道，有人仍试图“说服”特务分子与解释人员见面，而特务分子却要求有“更多的时间”来作决定。这种“说服”手段已经使得对朝鲜人民军被俘人员的解释工作拖延了六天。六天来的事实充分证明：对执行美方反解释计划的特务分子进行“说服”，将使解释工作继续遭到拖延和阻挠，特务分子并将取得充分时间来加紧进行破坏解释工作的活动，以阻止战俘申请遣返。
    【新华社开城二十二日电】中立国遣返委员会二十二日决定一名中国人民志愿军被俘人员的申请遣返有效。这名志愿军被俘人员就是被美国的合众社说成是在十七日听解释时至少有十七次表示“拒绝遣返”的。他在二十二日自己向中立国遣返委员会申请遣返，要求回到祖国。这个事实有力地驳斥了美方所谓“遣返组”组长汉布伦向中立国遣返委员会提出的抗议，汉布伦在抗议中曾经硬说朝中方面解释代表“最严重地违反不受强制的自由的原则”。这个事实也彻底揭破了美国新闻处捏造的硬说朝中方面“恐吓”战俘申请遣返的谎言。
    事实上，恐吓和威胁正是来自美方观察代表和以“拘留一方代表”及译员为名出现在解释帐篷中的蒋介石特务。当这名志愿军被俘人员在十七日下午听取解释时，美方观察代表与蒋匪特务不理会中立国遣返委员会附属机构印度主席的一再制止，大喊大闹地公开威胁这位战俘不得申请遣返，并粗野地辱骂中立国波兰人员，使解释工作无法继续进行。中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军当时赶来把这名志愿军被俘人员带走，送到印度看管部队自己的医院中单独隔离了六天。在二十二日的中立国遣返委员会会议上，这名志愿军被俘人员要求遣返回到祖国。中立国遣返委员会根据“解释和访问工作细则”第九条“战俘可以在任何时间与任何地点申请遣返”的规定，当场决定他的申请遣返有效。
    这名志愿军被俘人员将和其他五名朝中被俘人员一起，在二十三日上午十一时回到祖国怀抱。
