Reader Letters Summary

Actively Store Livestock Winter Fodder to Prepare for Next Year's Production Editor's Note: Mobilizing farmers to store dry grass for livestock wintering in conjunction with autumn harvest and planting to prepare for next year's production is a task that rural work cadres in various regions should pay attention to. Livestock is one of the indispensable and important tools in agricultural production in our country. Doing a good job in livestock feeding and management this winter will greatly benefit next year's spring plowing. This year, livestock fodder production has been reduced in some drought-stricken or waterlogged areas, and livestock feed will be scarce in winter. However, there is still a considerable period of time before frost, and wild weeds in mountainous areas outside of Northeast China are still growing. As long as more wild grass is cut before frost and dried and stored in time, the difficulty of grass shortage in winter can be overcome. Now, we publish the abstracts of two letters from readers reflecting the situation of solving winter livestock fodder in some areas.

Lu Qinshu and Yang Qiyun's Mutual Aid Groups Actively Store Livestock Winter Fodder

Readers Jin Ligui and Zhao Piquan from Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, wrote: Lu Qinshu and Yang Qiyun, the leaders of two mutual aid groups in Honghuazhang Village, Lingchuan County, actively mobilized group members to attach importance to the work of storing livestock winter fodder as early as the beginning of August. They cited the fact that livestock lacked winter fodder last year, resulting in weak physiques and affecting spring plowing work, to educate group members. At the same time, they also made a detailed calculation for the group members: These two groups have a total of 32 head of livestock, large and small. In addition to grazing on mountain slopes for five months (May to September) each year, they are fed at home for seven months. Each head of livestock eats an average of 400 jin of grass per month, and 32 head of livestock need about 90,000 jin of fodder for seven months. The total amount of fodder in the two groups, including grain grass, corn stalks, bean stalks, bean pod skins, millet stalks, and grain chaff, is 66,390 jin, and the livestock fodder is still short of more than 23,000 jin. After such a calculation, the complacent thinking of some group members who thought that there was no shortage of fodder was overcome. All group members said that they would accumulate fodder that can feed livestock when weeding autumn fields and cutting wild grass for fertilizer accumulation. After a month of efforts by the two groups, they had accumulated more than 11,000 jin of fodder by early September. Now they are combining autumn harvest work to prepare to cut more than 10,000 jin of green grass to supplement the livestock fodder and ensure that livestock has sufficient fodder for the winter.

Huanghua County Li Mazhakuo Village Party Branch Mobilizes Women to Store Dry Grass for Feeding Livestock

Readers Bingzhong, Yunlong, Shushan, Lizhong, Dexin, and Pinshan from Huanghua County, Hebei Province, wrote: This year's large fields in Li Mazhakuo Village, Huanghua County, were flooded, and livestock fodder is scarce. By the beginning of August, the water in most of the flooded land in the village had receded, and wild grass was growing well in the fields. However, the land needed to be prepared for planting wheat, and agricultural work began to become tense. At this time, the Party branch immediately convened a meeting of Party members to discuss how to ensure timely wheat planting while doing a good job in storing livestock fodder. In addition to deciding to mobilize the masses to actively prepare the land, the meeting also determined that branch committee member Chen Huandong (female) would mobilize women to cut grass, and extract male labor to prepare the land and plant wheat. After Comrade Chen Huandong accepted this task, she went to the fields twice a day to cut grass, using practical actions to influence the masses; and united women activists Geng Xiurong, Wei Jinglan, and six members of the Youth League to jointly mobilize more than 20 women to participate in the grass cutting work. They put forward the slogan "Carry a basket now (meaning cutting grass), and spring plowing next year will not be difficult," to further mobilize the women of the village to participate in grass cutting. By early September, 58 women in the village participated in grass cutting. By the end of September, the village had dried more than 64,000 jin of green grass. The masses generally said: Our village women have cut so much grass, which guarantees that the livestock will not go hungry, and production will not be difficult next year.

Hebei Province Lixian County Cotton Farmers Request Resolution of Self-Retained Cotton Seed Ginning Issue

Reader Shang Wen from Lixian County, Hebei Province, wrote: The People's Government called on us cotton farmers to select good seed cotton for seed retention in the cotton fields, and this has become our habit for several years. However, since the county's cooperative has uniformly contracted for cotton collection, private ginning has become difficult. Last year, most of the manual cotton gins were centralized to be used by the cooperative for ginning; the few cotton gins left for the masses were also organized by the cooperative to gin for the public when new cotton was heavily marketed. Therefore, the seed cotton we selected could not be ginned into cotton seeds and had to be sold as general seed cotton. There are still some cotton farmers who are selling the seed cotton selected last year one after another. If this problem is not solved quickly this year, the efforts of cotton farmers in the county to select seeds will be wasted, and cotton seeds will have to be purchased for planting next year. According to my understanding, this situation also exists in other places. I suggest that the local county People's Governments and supply and marketing cooperatives pay attention to solving this problem as soon as possible.

Songjiang County Farmers Plant Large Amounts of Red Clover to Prepare Fertilizer for Next Year's Production

Gan Cheng from the Songjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Jiangsu Province wrote: Red clover (purple cloud) is a fertilizer with extremely high fertilizer efficiency. It can promote crop growth and improve soil structure. Many farmers in Songjiang County attach great importance to planting red clover. They said: If you plant red clover well, you can solve most of the fertilizer problem next year.

After this year's autumn harvest, the Songjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Songjiang County People's Government instructed the district committees and district People's Governments to send cadres to go deep into the masses and experienced farmers to study the methods of planting red clover. Cadres and farmers summarized the methods of opening more ditches (opening a ditch every four rows) and opening ditches early (opening immediately after the rice harvest) to prevent red clover from being waterlogged; mixing seeds with plant ash to maintain temperature and prevent red clover from freezing. At the same time, they also carefully studied the different methods of planting red clover in early rice fields, late rice fields, cotton fields, and buckwheat fields. The county cooperative also prepared 380,000 jin of red clover seeds for farmers to use. According to preliminary statistics, the area of land planted with red clover in the county has expanded by more than 80,000 mu; these fields are all leisure fields that do not grow any crops in autumn and winter, so they do not affect grain production.

Yuan Mochen Learned About the Superiority of Agricultural Production Cooperatives From Personal Experience

Yang Zhenfu from Fuzhuang, Qiqu, Lingchuan, Shanxi Province wrote: Yuan Mochen is a member of the Lian Quanbao Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Yuanzhuang Village, Qiqu. In the past, his family was very poor, and his family of eight only had seven mu of land; after land reform, they had a total of eighteen mu of land. However, because he had many children in his family and Mochen had a heart ache, life was still quite difficult. In the winter of 1951, when the Lian Quanbao Agricultural Production Cooperative was established, Yuan Mochen quickly joined the cooperative after ideological mobilization by the cooperative cadres. In order to help his family solve their difficulties, Lian Quanbao and other members borrowed a total of five or six dan of grain from him, and the People's Government also subsidized his family 150,000 yuan. Last spring, the cooperative took care of his health and allowed him to help drive felts in the felt workshop without doing heavy work. Later, the cooperative established a busy farming nursery, and his wife was freed from the burden of the children and could often work in the fields. In the autumn, his family received a total of twenty-two dan and three dou of grain, which was ten dan more than when he was in the mutual aid group in 1951. This summer, Yuan Mochen saw that the crops in the field were growing very well, and he began to make "small calculations" in his heart, secretly saying to people: "My good land, it looks like I can harvest at least forty dan of grain this year. Aren't the cooperative members getting more grain because of my good land?" After Lian Quanbao learned about Yuan Mochen's ideological situation, he talked to him several times to help him recall the difficult days before joining the cooperative, and compared the three mu of land he planted himself with the land he entered into the cooperative. Although the soil quality of the two pieces of land was the same, the cooperative could harvest more grain because of its meticulous cultivation and more fertilization, while the self-retained land was far worse. At the general meeting of all members, Lian Quanbao reported to everyone on the cultivation situation in the past two years, and announced the autumn harvest distribution plan. Yuan Mochen and his wife worked a total of 230 labor days. Including land dividends, fertilizer, and pesticide investments, plus the income from the three mu of self-retained land, it is estimated that they can earn 42 dan of grain this year. This made both of them extremely happy. Yuan Mochen said with shame and gratitude: "Now I understand that my past thoughts were all wrong. Only when everyone works collectively in the cooperative can cultivation techniques be improved, and can more grain be harvested and a good life be lived. I will never withdraw from the cooperative again."

Shanxi Xin County Party and Government Leading Organs Should Help Sanjiao Township Consolidate Mutual Aid Organizations

Reader Feng Zhide wrote: Sanjiao Township is a relatively large township in Qiqu, Xin County, Shanxi Province. The township has a total of 615 households and originally had 38 mutual aid groups; after two rectifications this spring and autumn, the mutual aid groups are still "disbanded when busy and change labor when idle." This spring, when correcting the tendency of blindly advancing, the mutual aid groups in the township were reorganized into 26 seasonal groups. However, because the superiority of "organizing" was not well publicized at that time, and the main problems existing in the mutual aid groups were not seriously resolved, some ineffective mutual aid groups were simply disbanded; the remaining groups, when it was busy with summer hoeing, disbanded and worked independently because the problems of hoeing time and equal labor were not well resolved. Except for the Wang Fuhuai group, the remaining 25 groups disbanded. By the end of summer hoeing, some groups only changed labor for a few days.

After the beginning of autumn, the county proposed that each township should conduct a rectification of mutual aid organizations after hanging up the hoes and before the autumn harvest. Therefore, Sanjiao Township reorganized the mutual aid groups in conjunction with the work of suppressing green manure. However, the problems existing in the group, especially how to arrange the autumn planting, autumn harvest, and autumn plowing work, as well as the use of labor and animal power and the equal labor, have not been resolved, and even the Wang Laizhong mutual aid group, which was personally led by Township Head Wang Baosheng, has not been rectified well. The Wang Laizhong group is a better group in Dongyu Village, with a total of nine households in the group. In this rectification, because the problem of equal labor could not be resolved, one household with weak labor was "rectified" out, leaving only eight households with similar labor strength; when discussing the arrangements for autumn harvest and other production, each group member wanted to harvest first, so it was decided that each would harvest their own crop during the autumn harvest, and then organize after the crops were brought to the market and the land was cultivated.

Why can't the mutual aid groups in this township be consolidated and improved? This is inseparable from the lack of attention of the leaders of the district and township. After correcting the tendency of blindly advancing, the leading cadres of the district lacked in-depth inspection and specific leadership of the work of the mutual aid groups. There are often one or two cadres in the district who help with work in this township, but these cadres have not gone deep into the mutual aid groups from spring to autumn to discover problems and solve problems, nor have they helped township cadres to specifically study how to rectify and consolidate the mutual aid groups. The township government and the Party branch have not specially studied the leadership of the mutual aid groups once since the spring correction of the tendency of blindly advancing. Only three of the seven members of the township government participated in the mutual aid group; only eight of the forty Party members in the township participated in the mutual aid group; and only three of the twenty-four members of the Youth League participated in the mutual aid group. I feel that this situation should not be allowed to continue, and I hope that the leading organs of Xin County will quickly correct it.

Chaotic Financial System of Some Agricultural Production Cooperatives in the Suburbs of Taiyuan City Caused Anxiety Among Members

Chen Shoujing and Ma Zhongxiu from the Suburban Work Committee of the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government wrote: Some time ago, the Suburban Work Committee of the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government inspected the financial management of various agricultural production cooperatives and found that the accounts of many cooperatives were chaotic and unclear. For example, the members of the Peng Shengkai Cooperative in Songzhuang Village kept the money from selling melons themselves and did not hand it over for accounting; the beans that the tofu workshop in the cooperative sold tofu for were not recorded and no one cared about it. The 600,000 yuan loan that the Xue Xizhi Cooperative in Jiajie Village borrowed from the bank was not recorded when the members used it; many of the fodder and seeds invested by the members were not recorded, and there were also errors in the records; no one knew whether the cooperative's vinegar workshop was making money or losing money. These two cooperatives have not announced their accounts to the members since they were established. The members do not know the economic situation of the cooperative. They are afraid that they will not be able to distribute much grain after the autumn harvest, which affects the enthusiasm for production. Some members also have the idea of "being in the cooperative if it is profitable, and leaving the cooperative if it is not profitable" after the autumn harvest.

Now the Suburban Work Committee of the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government is helping various cooperatives to find ways to solve this problem. It is hoped that areas with similar situations can also pay attention to this to avoid affecting the consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives.

    读者来信摘要
    积极贮备牲畜过冬饲草为明年的生产做好准备编者按：动员农民结合秋收秋种，贮备牲畜过冬的干草，为明年的生产做好准备，这是各地农村工作干部应该重视的一项工作。牲畜是目前我国在进行农业生产中不可缺少的重要工具之一。在今冬做好牲畜的饲养与管理，对明年顺利地进行春耕有很大好处。今年在某些受旱或受涝的地区，牲畜饲草减产，冬季牲畜饲料将感缺乏。但是目前距降霜还有相当长的一段时期，除东北地区外，山地野外杂草还在生长；只要在降霜以前多割野草，及时晒干贮藏起来，冬季缺草困难是可以克服的。现将读者反映某些地区解决冬季牲畜饲草情况的两封来信摘要发表于后。
    吕勤书、杨其运两个互助组积极贮备牲畜过冬的饲草
    山西陵川县读者靳理贵、赵丕全来信：我县红花掌村吕勤书和杨其运两个互助组长在八月初就积极动员组员重视贮备牲畜过冬饲草的工作。他们举出了去年牲畜因缺乏过冬饲草、体质瘦弱而影响春耕工作的事实，来教育组员。同时，又向组员们算了一笔细账：这两个组共有大小牲畜三十二头，每年除在山坡放牧五个月（五至九月）外，还有七个月是在家里喂养；每头牲口平均每月以吃草四百斤计算，三十二头牲口七个月共需饲草约九万斤。两组的谷草、玉茭秆子及豆秸、豆荚皮、黍秆、谷糠等总共有饲草六万六千三百九十斤，牲口饲草还缺二万三千多斤。经过这样一算，克服了某些组员认为饲草不缺的自满思想。全体组员都表示，要在秋田除草和割野草积肥时，把能喂牲畜的饲草积下来。两组经过一个月的努力，到九月初已经积下饲草一万一千多斤。现在他们正结合秋收工作，准备再打一万多斤青草来补足牲畜饲草，保证牲畜有充足的饲草过冬。
    黄骅县李马闸口村党支部发动妇女贮备喂牲口的干草
    河北省黄骅县读者秉忠、云龙、淑善、立中、德新、品山来信：我县李马闸口村今年大田被涝，牲畜饲草缺乏。到八月上旬，全村大部分水涝地的水退了，地里野草生长得很好；可是土地又需要准备种麦，农活开始紧张起来。这时党支部马上召开了党员大会，讨论如何保证及时种麦，同时做好贮存牲畜饲草的工作。会上除决定发动群众积极整地外，并确定由支部委员陈焕东（女）发动妇女割草，抽出男劳动力来整地种麦。陈焕东同志接受了这个任务后，自己每天两次下地割草，用实际行动来影响群众；并团结了妇女积极分子耿秀荣、魏景兰和六个青年团员，共同发动二十多个妇女参加了割草工作。她们提出了“现在提提篮（割草的意思），明年春耕不为难”的口号，进一步发动全村妇女群众参加割草。九月上旬，全村就有五十八个妇女参加割草。到九月底，全村共晒下干青草六万四千多斤。群众普遍说：咱村妇女们割下这么多草，保证牲口饿不着，明年生产就不难了。
    河北省蠡县棉农要求解决自留棉种轧花问题
    河北省蠡县棉农尚文来信：人民政府号召我们棉农在棉田里选好籽棉留种，几年来这已成为我们的习惯了。但自从我县合作社统一包收棉花以后，私人轧花发生了困难。去年人力轧花机大部被集中起来给合作社轧花；留给群众用的少数轧花机，在新花大批上市时也被合作社组织起来给公家轧花了。因此，我们选出来的籽棉没法轧出棉种，只好按一般籽棉卖了。现在还有一些棉农，仍在陆续不断地出卖去年选出的籽棉。这个问题今年如不赶快解决，全县棉农选种的工夫又要白白地浪费掉，明年还得买棉籽作种。据我了解，这种情况在其它地方也存在。我建议各地县人民政府与供销合作社及早注意解决这个问题。
    松江县农民大量种植红花草为明年生产准备肥料
    中共江苏省松江县委员会干城来信：红花草（紫云英）是一种肥效极高的肥料，它能促进作物生长，改良土壤结构。松江县不少农民非常重视种植红花草。他们说：种好红花草，明年肥料就解决大一半。
    今年秋收后，中共松江县委和松江县人民政府指示各区区委和区人民政府派干部深入群众和有经验的农民研究种植红花草的办法。干部和农民们总结出要多开沟（每四畦开一条沟），早开沟（稻子收割后立刻开）的办法以防止红花草涝死；用草木灰拌种，保持温度，防止红花草受冻。同时还细致地研究了在早稻田、晚稻田、棉田和荞麦田中种植红花草的不同方法。县合作社也准备了三十八万斤红花草种籽供应农民使用。根据初步统计，全县种植红花草的土地面积扩大了八万亩以上；这些田地都是秋冬不种任何作物的休闲田，因此也不影响粮食生产。
    元磨成从亲身体验中认识了农业生产合作社的优越性
    山西陵川七区复庄杨振富来信：元磨成是七区原庄村连全保农林畜牧生产合作社的社员。过去，他家里很穷，全家八口人只有七亩地；土地改革后，共有了十八亩地。但是，因为他家里孩子多，磨成又有个心口疼的病，生活仍旧相当困难。一九五一年冬天，连全保农业生产合作社成立时，元磨成经过合作社干部的思想动员，很快地入了社。为了帮助他家解决困难，连全保和其他社员一共借了五、六石粮食给他，人民政府又救济了他家十五万元。去年春天，社里照顾他的身体有病，让他在毡坊里帮助赶毡子，不做重活。后来社里成立了农忙托儿所，他老婆摆脱了孩子的拖累，也能经常下地劳动了。秋天他家一共分到了二十二石三斗粮食，比一九五一年在互助组里时多分了十来石。今年夏季，元磨成看见地里庄稼长得很好，他心里就打起“小算盘”来，背地里见人就说：“我那好地呀，看样子今年最少也可以打四十多石粮。社员们多分粮还不是凭着我的好地吗？”连全保了解了元磨成的思想情况后，就找他谈了好几次话，帮助他回忆入社前的艰难日子，又把他自种的三亩地和入社的地作了比较，两份地土质虽然相同，但由于社里耕作细致、施肥多，就能多打粮，自留地就差得远了。在全体社员大会上，连全保又向大家报告了两年来的耕作情况，并且宣布了秋收分配计划。元磨成俩口子共做了二百三十个劳动日，连土地分红和肥料、药剂等投资，加上三亩自留地的收入，今年估计可以收入四十二石粮食。这一下可把他俩口子喜坏啦，元磨成又惭愧又感激地说：“现在我才明白我过去的想法都错啦。只有在合作社里大家集体劳动，耕作技术才能改进，才能多打粮食过好生活。以后我决不退社了。”
    山西忻县党政领导机关应帮助三交乡巩固互助组织
    读者冯志德来信：三交乡是山西忻县七区比较大的一个乡，全乡共有六百一十五户，原有互助组三十八个；经过今年春秋两次整顿，互助组仍然是
    “忙时散伙、闲时变工”。今春在纠正盲目冒进的偏向时，全乡互助组整顿成二十六个季节组。但由于当时没有很好地宣传“组织起来”的优越性，没有认真地解决互助组中存在的主要问题，只是单纯地把一部分不起作用的互助组解散了；留下的组一到夏锄紧张时，因锄地先后和清齐工问题没有很好解决，除王福怀组外，其余二十五个组都散伙单干了。到夏锄快结束时，有些组才又变了几天工。
    立秋后，县里提出在挂锄后、秋收前各乡要进行一次整顿互助组织的工作，于是三交乡在结合压绿肥工作中又整顿了一次互助组。但是，组内存在着的问题，特别是秋种、秋收、秋耕工作如何安排，以及劳力、畜力的使用和等价清齐工等问题还是没有得到解决，就连乡长王保生亲自领导整顿的王来忠互助组也没有整顿好。王来忠组是东峪村较好的一个组，全组共有九户。在这次整顿中，由于劳力等价问题解决不了，就把劳力弱的一户“整顿”出去了，只留下劳力强弱差不多的八户；在讨论秋收等生产的安排时，组员们谁也要先收，结果就决定秋收各收各的，在秋收结束后庄稼上场和耕地时再组织起来干。
    为什么这乡的互助组不能巩固提高呢？这是和区、乡领导干部的不重视分不开的。区的领导干部在纠正盲目冒进的偏向后，对互助组的工作缺乏深入检查和具体领导。区里经常有一两个干部在这乡帮助工作，但这些干部从春到秋一直没有深入到互助组里去发现问题、解决问题，也没有帮助乡干部具体研究如何整顿巩固互助组的问题。而乡政府和党支部自今春纠正盲目冒进的偏向后，也再没有专门研究过一次互助组的领导问题。乡政府七个委员中只有三人参加了互助组；全乡四十个党员中只有八人参加互助组；二十四个青年团员只有三人参加互助组。我觉得，这种情况是不应让它继续存在下去的，希望忻县领导机关迅速加以纠正。
    太原市郊某些农业生产合作社财务制度混乱引起社员不安
    太原市人民政府郊区工作委员会陈守经、马钟秀来信：前些日子，太原市郊区工作委员会检查了一下各农业生产合作社的财务管理工作，发现好些合作社的账目都混乱不清。如松庄村彭生开社社员卖了瓜的钱都各自保留，不交出来记账；社里一座豆腐坊卖了豆腐换回的豆子，不记账也没人管。嘉节村薛喜只社贷银行的六十万元贷款，社员用了没上账；社员投资的草料、种籽等，有不少都未记账，已记账的也有错；社里的醋坊究竟是赚钱还是赔本都没人知道。这两个社自建社以来都没有向社员公布过账目，社员们对社的经济不摸底，怕秋后分不了多少粮，影响了生产积极性，部分社员还有着到秋收后“有利在社，无利出社”的思想。
    现在太原市郊区工作委员会正在帮助各合作社设法解决这个问题。希望有类似情况的地区也能对此加以重视，以免影响农业生产合作社的巩固和发展。
