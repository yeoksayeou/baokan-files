Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 28th (TASS): The USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have adopted a resolution on expanding the production of consumer goods and improving their quality.

Due to the victorious realization of the Communist Party's national industrialization policy, today the Soviet Union possesses a powerful heavy industry equipped with the latest equipment, which guarantees the rapid development of the national economy without relying on capitalist countries.

The solution of the task of prioritizing the development of heavy industry has fundamentally changed the ratio of heavy industry to light industry in the total industrial output. In 1953, the production of means of production accounted for about 70 percent of the total industrial output; therefore, the proportion of heavy industry in the total industrial output exceeded two-thirds. The achievements made in developing heavy industry have created all the necessary conditions for decisively increasing the production of consumer goods. Now, it is possible to greatly increase basic investment in industries that produce consumer goods. At the same time, it is already possible to produce more consumer goods in machine manufacturing, steel and chemical industries, and other heavy industrial enterprises.

Starting from the task of further improving the living standards of workers, collective farmers, intellectuals, and the entire Soviet people, the USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believe that it is necessary to greatly accelerate the development of light industry in the next two to three years in order to produce sufficient consumer goods and substantially increase the supply of these items to residents.

The resolution states that to accomplish these tasks, it is necessary to expand consumer goods production to the extent that industry can fulfill the consumer goods production tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan for 1955 ahead of schedule.

In the post-war period, light industry has already reached and greatly exceeded the pre-war level of consumer goods production. In 1953, 5.3 billion meters of cotton fabrics will be produced, an increase of 34 percent compared to 1940; more than 200 million meters of woolen fabrics, an increase of about 70 percent compared to 1940; more than 400 million meters of silk fabrics, more than five times that of 1940; and knitted underwear will be 2.2 times the pre-war level. The output of household appliances and cultural goods has greatly increased compared to 1940. In 1953, the total output of consumer goods exceeded the pre-war 1940 level by 72 percent.

However, the current production volume and quality of consumer goods are still unable to meet the growing needs of the working people. The development of some important consumer goods industrial sectors is not satisfactory.

The resolution states that our urgent task is to greatly increase the supply of consumer goods to residents in the next two to three years, such as: fabrics, clothing, shoes, ceramics, furniture, and other household items and cultural goods.

In addition to expanding the production of enterprises under the USSR Ministry of Consumer Goods Industry, local industries, cooperative industries, and heavy industries must also greatly increase the production of consumer goods.

The main tasks of local industries and production cooperatives are: to greatly increase the output of consumer goods and improve their quality, stipulating that the Urals, Siberia, the Far East, Central Asia, and Kazakhstan should prioritize the development of local industries and production cooperatives.

Greatly increasing the supply of consumer goods to residents, including cultural goods and household appliances that can save labor and improve the living conditions of the Soviet people, is one of the main tasks of various departments of heavy industry, mainly the Ministry of Steel Industry, the Ministry of Machine Manufacturing Industry, the Ministry of Power Stations and Electrical Industry, the Ministry of Transportation and Heavy Machine Manufacturing Industry, the Ministry of Defense Industry, the Ministry of Aircraft Industry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the USSR Ministry of Timber and Paper Industry, and the USSR Ministry of Building Materials Industry.

The USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out that improving the quality and increasing the output of consumer goods are equally important and stipulated that all workers in the consumer goods industry have the task of producing durable, beautiful, and high-quality consumer goods. All enterprises, all economic organizations, Party, and trade union organizations are responsible for ensuring that only durable and beautiful consumer goods are produced.

In order to increase the output, improve the quality, and expand the variety of consumer goods in the coming years, the USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have prescribed the following tasks for the production of major consumer goods:

In 1954, 5.549 billion meters of cotton fabrics will be produced, and in 1955, 6.267 billion meters of cotton fabrics will be produced; woolen fabrics – 242 million meters in 1954, and 271 million meters in 1955; silk fabrics – 504 million meters in 1954, and 573 million meters in 1955; linen fabrics – 295 million meters in 1954, and 406 million meters in 1955; knitted underwear – 326 million sets in 1954, and 382 million sets in 1955; knitted outerwear – 79 million pieces in 1954, and 88 million pieces in 1955; socks and stockings – 673 million pairs in 1954, and 777 million pairs in 1955; leather shoes – 267 million pairs in 1954, and 318 million pairs in 1955; felt boots – 27 million pairs in 1954, and 33.4 million pairs in 1955; outerwear – valued at 44 billion rubles in 1954, and 51.8 billion rubles in 1955; sewing machines – 1.335 million units in 1954, and 2.615 million units in 1955; bicycles – 2.51 million units in 1954, and 3.445 million units in 1955; motorcycles – 190,000 units in 1954, and 225,000 units in 1955; watches and clocks – 16.8 million units in 1954, and 22 million units in 1955; radios and televisions – 3.186 million units in 1954, and 4.527 million units in 1955, of which televisions account for 325,000 units in 1954, and 760,000 units in 1955; refrigerators – 200,700 units in 1954, and 330,000 units in 1955; furniture – valued at 5.336 billion rubles in 1954, and 6.958 billion rubles in 1955.

The resolution stipulates that the production volume of important consumer goods in 1956 will increase by approximately the following compared to 1950:

Woolen fabrics will be doubled, silk fabrics will be increased by 5.2 times, cotton fabrics will be increased by 70 percent, knitted underwear will be increased by 2.8 times, socks will be increased by 80 percent, leather shoes will be increased by 70 percent, sewing machines will be increased by 5.9 times, bicycles will be increased by 5.8 times, watches and clocks will be increased by 3.2 times, radios and televisions will be increased by 5 times, and furniture will be increased by 3.9 times.

The resolution of the USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pays great attention to expanding the variety of fabrics and improving their quality and stipulates tasks for the production of several types of cotton fabrics, woolen fabrics, silk fabrics, and linen fabrics. The resolution also stipulates specific tasks for increasing the output, expanding the variety, and improving the quality of certain consumer goods, such as clothing, furs, knitwear, shoes, apparel, ceramics, watches and clocks, bicycles, motorcycles, phonographs, cameras, and other cultural goods and household appliances.

One section of the resolution deals with the production of consumer goods by light industrial enterprises and production cooperative enterprises. The resolution points out that the production of consumer goods by local industrial and production cooperative enterprises in various Union Republics has not met the growing needs of residents. The resolution instructs the Councils of Ministers of various Union Republics and the Central Council of Production Cooperatives to take a series of concrete measures to ensure a significant increase in the production of consumer goods by local industrial and production cooperative enterprises. The resolution stipulates granting state loans to local industrial enterprises and production cooperative enterprises in order to carry out and expand the production of consumer goods, food, and building materials, and to establish and expand service agencies.

The final part of the resolution deals with basic construction, stating that in the near future, fundamental changes must occur in the work of constructing and expanding enterprises producing consumer goods. The USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided to accelerate the construction of the following major enterprises and make them start production in 1954-1956: the cotton textile enterprises in Kamyshin, Engels, Kherson, Barnaul, Stalinabad, Gori, Cheboksary, Yartsevo, Omsk, Kalinin , Serpuhov, Furmanov, Kineshma, Vyshny Volochok and Poltava; woolen textile enterprises in Minsk, Bryansk, Krasnodar, Ivanovo, Sverdlovsk, Kansk, Chernigov, Pavlovsky Posad; silk textile enterprises in Krasnoyarsk, Bender, Kiev (Darnitsa), Narofominsk, Kalinin and Leninabad; flax textile enterprises in Smolensk, Orsha, Pskov and Panevezys; knitted textile enterprises in Cheboksary and Chistopol; tanning and shoe-making enterprises in Ulyanovsk, Ulan-Ude, Velikiye Luki, Dzhambul, Voroshilovgrad, Tallinn, Novosibirsk, Stalino, Stalingrad, Oryol, Voronezh, Kamyshlov and Baku. In 1954-1956, existing textile, knitting, tanning and shoemaking enterprises will be renovated and expanded and equipped with highly productive equipment. The resolution instructs the USSR Ministry of Consumer Goods Industry to utilize the following production capacity in 1954-1955: 480,000 spindles will be put into production in 1954, and 1.381 million spindles will be put into production in 1955, including 1.18 million spindles for cotton textile industry and 181,000 spindles for woolen textile industry. 15,507 looms should be put into production in 1954, and 38,000 looms in 1955, including 32,130 looms for cotton textile industry, 3,204 looms for woolen textile industry, and 2,080 looms for silk textile industry. It is planned to expand the production capacity of the shoe industry by 20 million pairs in 1954 and 35 million pairs in 1955. The production capacity of hosiery will also be expanded by 22.2 million pairs and 36 million pairs respectively in two years. The capacity of leather production will also be expanded.

The amount of basic investment in the USSR Ministry of Consumer Goods Industry in 1954 is determined to be 5.85 billion rubles, while the funds expected to be invested in this area in 1953 are only 3.148 billion rubles.

The resolution of the USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that fully and continuously ensuring that enterprises producing consumer goods receive raw materials, equipment, fuel, electricity, and equipment is the primary task.

The resolution concludes: The USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party believe that ensuring the rapid upsurge in the production of consumer goods is the most important task of all ministries, all competent authorities, and the Councils of Ministers of all Union Republics, and instructs the ministers of all ministries, the heads of all competent authorities, and the chairmen of the Councils of Ministers of all Union Republics to formulate measures in the draft economic plan for 1954 to ensure the unconditional implementation of this resolution.

    苏联部长会议和苏共中央
    通过关于扩大日用品生产的决议
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日电：苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会通过了关于扩大日用品生产并改进其质量的决议。
    由于共产党的国家工业化政策的胜利实现，今天，苏联已拥有一个强大的、有最新式设备的重工业，它保证了国民经济不依靠资本主义国家而得到迅速的发展。
    首先发展重工业这一任务的解决，从根本上改变了重工业和轻工业在工业总产量中的比例。在一九五三年，生产资料的生产量约占工业总产量的百分之七十，因此，重工业在工业总产量中的比重超过了三分之二。发展重工业所获得的成就，已经为决定性地增加日用品生产创造了一切必要的条件。现在，已经有可能大大增加对各项生产日用品的工业的基本投资。同时已有可能在机器制造、钢铁和化学工业以及其他重工业企业中生产更多的日用品。
    苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会从进一步提高工人、集体农民和知识分子以及全体苏维埃人民的生活水平这样一个任务出发，认为必须在今后两三年中大大地加速轻工业的发展，以便生产足够的日用品，并且大量增加这些物品对居民的供应量。
    决议说，要完成这些任务，必须把日用品生产扩大到使工业能够提前完成五年计划为一九五五年规定的日用品生产任务。
    在战后时期中，轻工业已经达到了并且大大地超过了战前的日用品生产水平。在一九五三年，将生产五十三亿公尺棉织品，比一九四○年增加百分之三十四；二亿多公尺毛织品，比一九四○年增加百分之七十左右；四亿多公尺丝织品，为一九四○年的五倍以上；针织内衣将为战前的二点二倍。家庭用具和文化用品的产量已经比一九四○年大为增加。在一九五三年，日用品的总产量比战前一九四○年的水平超过百分之七十二。
    然而，目前的日用品生产量和质量还是不能满足劳动人民日益增长的需要。某些重要的日用品工业部门的发展不能令人满意。
    决议说，我们的迫切任务就是在今后两三年内，大大增加对居民的日用品供应，如：织物、服装、鞋类、陶器、家具和其他家庭用品以及文化用品。
    除扩大苏联日用品工业部所属各企业的生产外，地方工业和合作社工业以及重工业也必须大大增加日用品的生产。
    地方工业和生产合作社的主要任务是：大大增加日用品的产量并提高其质量，规定乌拉尔、西伯利亚、远东、中亚细亚和哈萨克优先发展地方工业和生产合作社。
    大大增加供应居民的日用品，其中包括能节省劳动并改善苏维埃人民生活条件的文化用品和家庭用品的生产，是重工业各个部，主要是钢铁工业部、机器制造工业部、电站和电气工业部、运输和重型机器制造工业部、国防工业部、飞机工业部、化学工业部、苏联木材和造纸工业部和苏联建筑材料工业部的主要任务之一。
    苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会指出，提高日用品的质量和增加产量同样重要，并规定日用品工业的所有工人有任务生产经久耐用的、美观的、质量很高的日用品。各企业、一切经济组织、党和工会组织有责任保证只生产经久耐用的、美观的日用品。
    为了在今后几年中增加日用品的产量，提高其质量并扩大其种类，苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会为主要日用品的生产规定了下列任务：
    一九五四年将生产五十五亿四千九百万公尺棉织品，一九五五年将生产六十二亿六千七百万公尺棉织品，毛织品——一九五四年二亿四千二百万公尺，一九五五年二亿七千一百万公尺；丝织品——一九五四年五亿零四百万公尺，一九五五年五亿七千三百万公尺；麻织品——一九五四年二亿九千五百万公尺，一九五五年四亿零六百万公尺；针织内衣——一九五四年三亿二千六百万套，一九五五年三亿八千二百万套；针织外衣——一九五四年七千九百万件，一九五五年八千八百万件；长短袜——一九五四年六亿七千三百万双，一九五五年七亿七千七百万双；皮鞋——一九五四年二亿六千七百万双，一九五五年三亿一千八百万双；毡靴——一九五四年二千七百万双，一九五五年三千三百四十万双；外衣——一九五四年价值四百四十亿卢布，一九五五年，五百一十八亿卢布；缝纫机——一九五四年，一百三十三万五千架，一九五五年二百六十一万五千架；自行车——一九五四年二百五十一万辆，一九五五年三百四十四万五千辆；机器脚踏车——一九五四年十九万辆，一九五五年二十二万五千辆；钟表——一九五四年一千六百八十万个，一九五五年二千二百万个；收音机及电视机——一九五四年三百一十八万六千个，一九五五年四百五十二万七千个，其中电视机，一九五四年三十二万五千个，一九五五年七十六万个；冷藏器——一九五四年二十万零七千个，一九五五年三十三万个；家具——一九五四年价值五十三亿三千六百万卢布，一九五五年价值六十九亿五千八百万卢布。
    决议规定一九五六年重要日用品的生产量比一九五○年大约增加如下：
    毛织品增为二倍，丝织品增为五点二倍，棉织品增加百分之七十，针织内衣增为二点八倍，袜类增加百分之八十，皮鞋增加百分之七十，缝纫机增为五点九倍，自行车增为五点八倍，钟表增为三点二倍，收音机及电视机增为五倍，家具增为三点九倍。
    苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会的决议十分注意扩大织品的种类和改进它们的质量，并规定了生产若干种棉织品、毛织品、丝织品和麻织品的任务。决议又规定了增加某些日用品的产量、扩大其种类和改进其质量的具体任务，这些日用品是服装、毛皮、针织品、鞋类、服饰用品、陶器、钟表、自行车、机器脚踏车、留声机、照相机和其他文化用品和家庭用品。
    决议中有一部分谈到轻工业企业和生产合作社企业的日用品生产。决议指出，各加盟共和国的地方工业和生产合作社企业的日用品生产，没有满足居民日益增长的需要。决议责成各加盟共和国部长会议和生产合作社中央理事会采取一系列的具体措施，以使地方工业和生产合作社企业的日用品生产得到显著的增长。决议规定给予地方工业企业和生产合作社企业以国家贷款，以便进行和扩大日用品、食品和建筑材料的生产，成立和扩大服务机构。
    决议最后一部分谈到基本建设，这一部分说，在最近的将来，必须使建设和扩大生产日用品的企业的工作发生根本的变化。苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会决定加速下列各大企业的建设，并使其在一九五四—一九五六年中开始生产：卡米新、恩格斯、刻松、巴尔瑙尔、斯大林纳巴德、哥里、契鲍克萨利、雅尔泽沃、鄂木斯克、加里宁、塞尔普霍夫、弗尔曼诺夫、基涅绍马、维什尼沃洛切克和波尔塔发的棉织业企业；明斯克、布利安斯克、克拉斯诺达、伊凡诺佛、斯维德洛夫斯克、坎斯克、切尔尼哥夫、巴夫洛夫镇的毛织业企业；克拉斯诺雅尔斯克、宾杰里、基辅（达尼萨）、纳罗福明斯克、加里宁和列宁纳巴德的丝织业企业；斯摩棱斯克、奥尔沙、普斯科夫和潘涅维日斯的麻织业企业；契鲍克萨利和契尼科夫斯克的针织业企业；乌里扬诺夫斯克、乌兰乌德、维利基鲁基、江布尔、伏罗希洛夫格勒、塔林、新西伯利亚、斯大林诺、斯大林格勒、奥勒尔、沃罗涅兹、卡米什洛夫和巴库的制革和制鞋业企业。在一九五四—一九五六年中将现有的纺织业、针织业、制革业和制鞋业的企业加以改建和扩充，并装备以有高度生产力的设备。决议责成苏联日用品工业部在一九五四—一九五五年间利用下列生产能力：在一九五四年将有四十八万个纱锭投入生产，在一九五五年将有一百三十八万一千个纱锭投入生产，其中棉织业一百一十八万纱锭，毛织业十八万一千纱锭。在一九五四年投入生产的织布机应有一万五千五百零七台，一九五五年有三万八千台，其中棉织业有三万二千一百三十台，毛织业有三千二百零四台，丝织业有二千零八十台。计划把制鞋工业的生产能力在一九五四年扩大二千万双，在一九五五年扩大三千五百万双。袜类生产的生产能力在两年中也相应地扩大二千二百万双和三千六百万双。皮革生产的能力也将扩大。
    一九五四年苏联日用品工业部方面的基本投资数额确定为五十八亿五千万卢布，而一九五三年预计投在这方面的资金只有三十一亿四千八百万卢布。
    苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会的决议认为，充分而不断地保证生产日用品的企业得到原料、器材、燃料、电力和设备是首要的任务。
    决议最后说：苏联部长会议和苏共中央认为，保证日用品生产的迅速高涨，是各部、各主管机关和各加盟共和国部长会议的最重要的任务，并责成各部部长、各主管机关负责人和各加盟共和国部长会议主席，在一九五四年经济计划草案中拟定保证本决议得以无条件实现的措施。
