Resolution of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
"On Measures for Further Development of Soviet Trade"

To expand commodity circulation and improve state-owned, cooperative, and collective farm trade organizations by every means is of increasing importance to solving the pressing task of greatly increasing the supply of various daily necessities to residents and further improving the material welfare of workers, collective farmers, intellectuals, and all Soviet people.

Trade under the socialist system is now and will remain for a long time the main form of distribution of consumer goods among members of socialist society, through which to meet the growing personal needs of the working people.

The current task is to earnestly advance the development of Soviet trade, and within two or three years, ensure the uninterrupted sale of all necessary commodities for residents in every city and every agricultural area, greatly improve services to consumers, ensure the satisfaction of consumers' growing needs, widely establish trade enterprises with modern technical equipment, and rapidly transport the increasing number of industrial and agricultural consumer goods to consumers.

Although our commodity circulation is constantly developing, it still cannot fully meet the residents' needs for some commodities. There are still some major shortcomings in trade organizations that hinder the further development of trade and the improvement of services to residents. Trade organizations have not properly studied the needs of residents, and have allowed serious shortcomings to exist in the distribution and transportation of commodities. In some areas, it is still not possible to supply residents with all necessary commodities, and the sufficient supply of commodities is often intermittent. Trade organizations have done a poor job in helping industrial departments increase the production of commodities needed by residents and improve their quality, and have not done enough to strive to make industrial departments improve the quality of products supplied to trade organizations.

There are also major shortcomings in the organization and distribution of retail trade organizations. Trade enterprises have very little modern trade equipment and refrigeration equipment, as well as modern appliances; and there are no necessary warehouses for the storage and classification of commodities and the planned supply of commodities to trade organizations. Loading and unloading and other heavy work in warehouses are not mechanized.

The organization of the public catering industry still lags behind the growing needs of residents. In some cities, district centers, and workers' residential areas, there is still a lack of canteens, tea rooms, snack bars, and public catering enterprises. Many public canteens are not concerned about improving services to customers, so that customers have to wait a long time to get food. The variety of dishes is also often monotonous and of poor quality. The technical equipment and refrigeration equipment of public catering enterprises are unsatisfactory, and often even good tableware and canteen utensils are not complete.

Trade in rural areas is still far behind the growing demands of collective farms and collective farmers. In rural areas, the sale of daily necessities and household goods such as timber, bricks, and tiles is not organized satisfactorily.

In many district centers, there are no department stores of consumer cooperatives. In small villages without fixed trade organizations, the supply to residents is very insufficient, and consumer cooperatives cannot fully attract members to actively participate in cooperative work and inspection of trade work. There are also major shortcomings in carrying out collective farm trade work. The work of purchasing surplus agricultural products from collective farms and collective farmers that are needed by urban residents is not done well.

In order to ensure the vigorous development of Soviet trade, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided:

(A) On Further Development of Commodity Circulation and Improvement of Trade Organization

(1) The retail commodity circulation of state-owned trade and cooperative trade in 1954 should increase by 72 percent compared with 1950 (calculated at comparable prices), while the Five-Year Plan stipulates an increase of only 70 percent in 1955, that is to say, to exceed the tasks of the Five-Year Plan in 1954; it should be ensured that the retail commodity circulation in 1955 will be approximately twice that of 1950.

(2) In 1954 and 1955, the sale of food and industrial products to residents should be greatly increased. Taking 1950 as the base, the total market supply of goods in 1955 and the tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan are compared, and the increase is as follows: (The first number is the number of increase stipulated in the Five-Year Plan in 1955, and the second number is the number of increase in 1955 according to the new tasks) Meat products - 1.9 times, 2.3 times; Fish products - 1.7 times, 2.1 times; Animal oil - 1.7 times, 1.9 times; Cheese - 2 times, 2.2 times; Vegetable oil - 2 times, 2.6 times; Sugar - 2 times, 2.3 times; Wine - 2 times, 2.4 times; Clothing - 1.8 times, 2.4 times; Textiles - 1.7 times, 1.8 times, of which wool and silk fabrics are increased by 2.4 times according to the new tasks; Stockings, short stockings - 2 times, 2.2 times; Knitwear - 2.2 times, 2.7 times; Furniture - 3 times, 4 times; Metal utensils - 2.5 times, 4.9 times; Bicycles - 3.5 times, 5.5 times; Sewing machines - 2.4 times, 5.1 times; Radios and televisions - 2 times, 4.4 times; Clocks and watches - 2.2 times, 2.6 times; of which wristwatches are increased by 4.7 times according to the new tasks; Household refrigerators, washing machines, and dust collectors are only increased several times according to the Five-Year Plan, but according to the new tasks, they will be increased more than ten times.

It is stipulated that the total market supply of major food and industrial products in 1956 will be further increased, approximately as follows compared with 1950: meat products will be increased by 2.6 times, fish products will be increased by 2.3 times, animal oil will be increased by 2.1 times, vegetable oil will be increased by 2.8 times, sugar will be increased by 2.4 times, textiles will be increased by 2 times, boots and shoes will be increased by 2 times, sewing machines will be increased by 5.9 times, bicycles will be increased by 6 times, radios and televisions will be increased by 5.3 times, and furniture will be increased by 4.8 times.

(1) Widely selling the goods necessary for rural residents and collective farms, without interrupting trade, and promptly supplying the needs of retail trade organizations. In rural areas, it is necessary to carefully study and comprehensively consider the needs of residents, and on this basis, put forward requirements for necessary commodities to industrial departments; to properly transport commodities to various Union Republics, Border Regions, States, Districts, and residential areas, and not to receive commodities from industrial departments that are not needed by residents or are of poor quality.

(2) In order to meet the needs of collective farmers and collective farms for timber, cement, roofing materials, nails, and other construction materials and production commodities, the trade in this type of commodity should be expanded on a large scale. In 1954-1956, 1,700 stores and warehouses operating in building materials and production supplies should be added.

(32) Because many consumer cooperatives have poorly organized work in supplying commodities to the retail network, many shop assistants have to close their shops to pick up goods. The Central Union of All-Soviet Consumer Cooperatives is now responsible for stopping this situation and ensuring the timely supply of commodities to trade organizations. In order to organize retail trade and regular circulation of goods, 500 automobiles and 200 motorboats will be allocated to the Central Union of All-Soviet Consumer Cooperatives in 1954.

    苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会
    “关于进一步发展苏联贸易的措施”的决议
    用一切办法扩大商品流通和改善国营、合作社和集体农庄的贸易机构，对于解决有关大大提高对居民的各种日用品的供应，并进一步增进工人、集体农民、知识分子、全体苏联人民的物质福利这一迫切的任务，具有日益重要的意义。
    社会主义制度下的贸易现在是而且在今后长时期内仍将是社会主义社会成员消费品分配的主要形式，通过这种形式来满足劳动人民日益增长的个人需求。
    目前的任务是：认真地把发展苏联贸易的工作推向前进，并在两三年内，保证在每一个城市和每一个农业区中不间断地销售居民全部必需的商品，大大改善对消费者的服务，保证满足消费者不断增长的需求，广泛地建立有现代技术设备的贸易企业，将不断增产的大批工业和农业消费品迅速运到消费者手中。
    虽然我国商品流通不断发展，但仍然不能完全满足居民对一些商品的需求。贸易机构中还存在着
    一些大的缺点，阻碍贸易进一步的发展和对居民的服务的改善。贸易机构没有好好地研究居民的需要，听任商品的分配和运输工作中存在严重的缺点。在一些地区内，至今仍不能供应居民以全部必需的商品，商品的充分供应往往间断。贸易机构在帮助工业部门增产居民所需的商品并改进其质量方面做得很差，在争取使工业部门改进其供应贸易机构的产品的质量方面做得不够。
    零售贸易机构的组织和分布工作中也有重大的缺点。贸易企业中很少有现代化的贸易设备和冷藏设备以及现代化的器具；并且没有必要的仓库来进行商品的保管和分类以及有计划地把商品供应给贸易机构的工作。在仓库中的装卸和其他繁重工作没有机械化。
    公共饮食业的组织还落后于居民不断增长的需要。在一些城市、区中心和工人住宅区，还缺乏食堂、茶室、点心部以及公共饮食企业。许多公共食堂很不关心改进对顾客的服务，以致顾客不得不等候很长时间才能吃得上饭。菜的花样也经常单调而且质量不高。公共饮食企业的技术设备和冷藏装备是不能令人满意的，往往连好的餐具和食堂器具都不齐备。
    乡村的贸易还远远地落后于集体农庄和集体农民的不断增长的要求。在农村中，日用品以及木材、砖、瓦这类家庭用品的销售工作，组织得不能令人满意。
    在许多的区中心，没有消费合作社的百货商店。在没有固定贸易机构的小乡村中，对居民的供应是很不够的，各消费合作社还不能充分地吸引社员积极参加合作社工作和检查贸易的工作。在开展集体农庄贸易工作中也有很大的缺点。向集体农庄和集体农民收购其剩余的而为城市居民所需要的农产品的工作做得很不好。
    为了保证苏联贸易事业的蓬勃发展，苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会决定：
    （甲）关于进一步发展商品流通和改善贸易组织
    （一）一九五四年国营贸易和合作社贸易的零售商品流通额应比一九五○年增加百分之七十二（按比较价格计算），而五年计划规定一九五五年只增加百分之七十，这就是说，要在一九五四年就超过五年计划的任务；应保证一九五五年零售商品流通额约增为一九五○年的两倍。
    （二）在一九五四年和一九五五年，应大量增加出售给居民的食品和工业品。以一九五○年为基数，一九五五年的市场货物总量和五年计划规定的任务比较，增加情况如下：（第一个数字是五年计划规定在一九五五年增加的数字，第二个数字是按照新的任务一九五五年所增加的数字）肉制品——一点九倍，二点三倍；鱼制品——一点七倍，二点一倍；动物油——一点七倍，一点九倍；乳酪——二倍，二点二倍；植物油——二倍，二点六倍；糖——二倍，二点三倍；葡萄酒——二倍，二点四倍；服装——一点八倍，二点四倍；纺织品——一点七倍，一点八倍，其中毛织品和丝织品按照新的任务增为二点四倍；长统、短统袜——二倍，二点二倍；针织品——二点二倍，二点七倍；家具——三倍，四倍；金属器皿——二点五倍，四点九倍；自行车——三点五倍，五点五倍；缝纫机——二点四倍，五点一倍；收音机和电视机——二倍，四点四倍；钟表——二点二倍，二点六倍；其中手表按照新的任务增为四点七倍；家用冷藏器，洗衣机，除尘器按照五年计划只增加几倍，而按照新的任务将增为十倍以上。
    规定一九五六年进一步增加的主要食品和工业品的市场总量，与一九五○年比较，约增加如下：肉制品增为二点六倍，鱼制品增为二点三倍，动物油增为二点一倍，植物油增为二点八倍，糖增为二点四倍，纺织品增为二倍，靴鞋增为二倍，缝纫机增为五点九倍，自行车增为六倍，收音机和电视机增为五点三倍，家具增为四点八倍。
    （三）责成苏联贸易部：
    （1）详细研究和从各方面考虑居民对商品的需求，在这个基础上保证工业的定货，正确地分配商品，并根据居民的季节需求、民族特点和日常生活的特点把商品运送到国内各个地区。为了研究城市和乡村居民的需求，要利用所有主要的贸易机构——批发商店、零售商店、大商店以及国内各地区的批发站的潜力，并接受贸易机构要求供应货物的申请书，要利用通讯网统计居民需求转变的材料，并采纳在贸易机构举办的顾客代表会议上发言的顾客们的建议。

    苏联部长会议和苏共中央委员会认为，保证国营的、合作社的、合作社—国家的和集体农庄的贸易的蓬勃发展是一切党、苏维埃和工会组织的最重要的任务之一。各地苏维埃、党和工会组织必须保证经常监督商店和食堂的工作，坚决反对破坏苏联贸易原则的行为，及时采取措施消除商店和食堂工作中的缺点，不断地改善对居民的服务。苏联部长会议和苏共中央委员会要求各地苏维埃和党组织改变目前轻视贸易和贸易工作人员的态度，并在他们的周围造成充满同志的支持和应有的尊重的气氛，因为苏联贸易是社会主义经济最重要的部门之一，而苏联贸易工作人员乃是执行天天为人民服务的光荣任务的社会主义劳动者队伍中的一个支队。全体苏联贸易工作人员的责任是，在最短期间内根除目前贸易组织和企业中的缺点，把苏联贸易提到新的、更高的水平。
