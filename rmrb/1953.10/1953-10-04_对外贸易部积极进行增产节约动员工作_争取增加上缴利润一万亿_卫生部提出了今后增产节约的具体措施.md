    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Ministry of Foreign Trade of the Central People's Government has mobilized all its staff to strive to fulfill and overfulfill this year's various plans, ensuring an increase in profit remittance of one trillion.
    The Ministry of Foreign Trade held meetings of bureau directors and managers on September 5th and September 18th respectively, as well as a general meeting of cadres above the section chief level. At the meetings, Ye Jizhuang, Vice Chairman of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council and Minister of Foreign Trade, and Li Zheren, Vice Minister of the Ministry, made mobilization reports on increasing production, increasing income, practicing strict economy, tightening expenditures, and fulfilling and overfulfilling the profit remittance plan. In their reports, they emphasized that the main ways to complete the tasks of increasing production and practicing economy in state-owned foreign trade enterprises are: actively organizing sources of goods, ensuring the accurate execution of import and export contracts, improving business management, expanding commodity turnover, accelerating capital turnover, reducing circulation costs, and reducing costs.
    On September 24th, the Ministry of Foreign Trade held an expanded ministerial meeting for discussion and deployment. The meeting believed that all units should immediately mobilize the masses and formulate specific measures; they must vigorously inspect and conscientiously implement import and export contracts, carefully check accounts, check inventory, clear backlogs, and systematically study methods to improve purchasing, processing, warehousing, transportation, and other work, so as to make institutions and systems as reasonable as possible.
    The meeting emphasized that in completing the task, close attention must be paid to preventing possible deviations. First, we must act in accordance with policies, resolutely fulfill domestic and foreign contracts, and strictly implement price policies. Second, we must rely on the masses and oppose turning the completion of tasks into a matter for only a few leaders, and oppose carrying out production increase and economy practice in isolation from various tasks. We must conscientiously implement various plans, and pay special attention to completing the procurement plan.

    According to Xinhua News Agency: The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government held a cadre meeting of the Ministry and its directly affiliated units in Beijing in late September to deploy the development of production increase and economy practice work. Minister of Health Li Dequan made a mobilization report on increasing production and practicing economy at the meeting, and put forward specific measures for increasing production and practicing economy in the future. Li Dequan pointed out: Production units of the health department (such as biological products) must first increase production, overfulfill production plans, and pay special attention to improving product quality, reducing costs, and saving raw materials when completing and overfulfilling production tasks. In basic construction work, efforts should be made to save money and stop waste. The personnel originally planned to be added to health institutions at all levels this year will no longer be added. At present, directly affiliated units have certain medical equipment in stock, which can be used as long as they are repaired, so do not buy new ones again. Office supplies, alcohol, cotton, gauze, etc. in health agencies and hospitals at all levels should be cherished to avoid waste. All appliances and articles should be substituted as much as possible, and repaired as much as possible. Finally, Li Dequan requested that leading cadres of all units personally take the lead, mobilize the masses, formulate practical and feasible plans for increasing production and practicing economy, implement them, and make them regular.

    对外贸易部积极进行增产节约动员工作
    争取增加上缴利润一万亿
    卫生部提出了今后增产节约的具体措施
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府对外贸易部动员全体工作人员，为争取完成和超额完成今年各项计划，保证增加上缴利润一万亿元而努力。
    对外贸易部在九月五日及九月十八日曾分别召开了局长、经理会议和科长以上干部大会。会上，政务院财政经济委员会副主任兼对外贸易部部长叶季壮和该部副部长李哲人分别作了关于增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支、完成和超额完成上缴利润计划的动员报告。他们在报告中着重指出，在国营对外贸易企业中完成增产节约任务的主要办法是：积极组织货源，保证进出口合同的准确执行，改善经营管理，扩大商品流转额，加速资金周转，降低流转费和降低成本。
    九月二十四日对外贸易部又召开扩大部务会议进行了讨论和布置。会议认为，各单位应立即发动群众，定出具体办法；必须大力检查和认真执行进出口合同，仔细检查账目，检查存货，清理积压，有系统地研究收购、加工、仓储、运输等工作的改进办法，使机构和制度尽量合理。
    会议着重指出，在完成任务中，必须严密注意防止可能发生的偏向。首先，必须按政策办事，坚决履行对内、对外合同，严格执行价格政策。其次，必须依靠群众，反对把完成任务变成仅仅是少数领导人的事情，反对撇开各种工作孤立地进行增产节约。必须认真执行各项计划，尤其要注意完成收购计划。
    据新华社讯：中央人民政府卫生部，在九月下旬召开了本部及在京各直属单位干部大会，布置开展增产节约工作。李德全部长在会上作了关于增产节约的动员报告，提出了今后增产节约的具体措施。李德全指出：卫生部门的生产单位（如生物制品），首先是要增加生产，超额完成生产计划，而且要在完成和超额完成生产任务时，特别注意提高产品质量，降低成本，节约原料。在基本建设工作中，应大力节约，制止浪费。原拟今年在各级卫生机构中增加的人员，不再增加。目前各直属单位存有某些医疗器械，只要经过修理，即可使用，不要再买新的。各级卫生机关、医院办公用具、酒精、棉花、纱布等要加以爱护，避免浪费。一切器具和物品，能代用的尽量代用，能修理的尽量修用。最后，李德全要求各单位领导干部亲自带头，发动群众，订出切实可行的增产节约计划，贯彻执行，并使之经常化。
