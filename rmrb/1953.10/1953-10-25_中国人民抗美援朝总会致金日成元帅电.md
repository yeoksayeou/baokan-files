To Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and the heroic Korean People's Army and Korean People:

    On the occasion of the third anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's departure to Korea to fight alongside the Korean People's Army against the American aggressors, the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, on behalf of all the Chinese people, extends warm congratulations and profound respect to you and the heroic Korean People's Army and Korean people.

    Our two peoples, China and Korea, have forged an unbreakable brotherly friendship with blood in the common struggle against the American aggressors, ensuring the security of our two countries, China and Korea, and peace in the Far East and the world. The victorious realization of the Korean armistice, which the people of the world are concerned about, shows that the American imperialists' plan to invade Korea has met with a shameful failure. The Korean people, who have become masters of their own country, are invincible. The heroic achievements of the Korean people in resisting American aggression are being unanimously praised by peace-loving people all over the world.

    At present, the American imperialists are still constantly violating the armistice agreement, undermining the prisoner repatriation agreement, and delaying and obstructing the convocation of the political conference, and attempting to undermine the armistice. All these despicable acts of the American warmongers have aroused the anger of all the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world. All these despicable acts of the American warmongers are enough to expose the increasing sharpening of their internal contradictions, and they are trapped in a dilemma. We, the entire Chinese people, have a firm determination: We will continue to deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and together with the heroic Korean people, strive to thoroughly implement the Korean armistice agreement, strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and strive to restore the war wounds suffered by the Korean people! May the fighting brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples be forever consolidated.

    The Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea

    中国人民抗美援朝总会致金日成元帅电朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅及英勇的朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民：
    值此中国人民志愿军出国与朝鲜人民军并肩抗击美国侵略者三周年之际，中国人民抗美援朝总会，谨代表全中国人民向您及英雄的朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民，致以热烈的庆贺和崇高的敬礼。
    我们中朝两国人民，在共同反抗美国侵略者的斗争中，用鲜血结成了牢不可破的兄弟友谊，保证了我们中朝两国的安全和远东与世界的和平。全世界人民所关心的朝鲜停战的胜利实现，正表明美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜的计划遭到可耻的失败。已经做了自己国家主人的朝鲜人民是不可战胜的。朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略者的英雄业绩，正受到全世界爱好和平人民的一致赞扬。
    目前美帝国主义者仍在不断地违反停战协定，破坏遣俘协议，拖延和阻挠政治会议的召开，并企图破坏停战。美国好战分子们的这一切卑鄙行为已引起全中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的愤怒。美国好战分子们的这一切卑鄙行为适足以暴露他们的内部矛盾的日益尖锐化，他们是陷在进退维谷的境地的。我们全中国人民具有着坚定的决心：我们要继续深入开展抗美援朝运动，与英雄的朝鲜人民一起，为争取朝鲜停战协定的彻底实施，为争取和平解决朝鲜问题，为恢复朝鲜人民所受的战争创伤而奋斗到底！祝中朝两国人民战斗的兄弟友谊永远巩固。
    中国人民抗美援朝总会
    一九五三年十月二十五日
