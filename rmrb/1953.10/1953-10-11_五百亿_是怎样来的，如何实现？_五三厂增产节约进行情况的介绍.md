    How Did the "50 Billion" Come About and How Can It Be Achieved?
    —An Introduction to the Production Increase and Savings at Factory 53
    An Gang
    Factory 53's plan to increase production and savings by 50 billion this year has guided and organized the thoughts and actions of everyone in the factory, and improved production efficiency. How did the 50 billion come about? Factory 53 has always been engaged in production under the guidance of an advanced plan. The planned production volume for 1953 increased by 43% compared to 1952, and the cost decreased by 42% compared to 1949. In 1953, the factory's action plan exceeded the national plan by 22% in terms of labor productivity, decreased costs by 4%, and increased output by 15%. In July of this year, Factory 53, based on strengthening planned management, promoting advanced experience, and consolidating labor discipline, formulated a plan to increase production and save 44 billion yuan. From September 7th to September 12th, the comrades of Factory 53 carefully analyzed various data on the completion of the national plan from January to August, identified various advanced factors, and also discovered new potential, deciding to increase production and save another 6 billion yuan for the country. The total annual increase in production and savings is 50 billion yuan. Furthermore, the national plan will be completed two and a half days ahead of schedule—a total of forty-two and a half days ahead. Undoubtedly, this is an advanced plan for increasing production and saving. Where does the confidence in completing the plan lie? The most important thing is that everyone from leading cadres to workers is aware of the situation and can grasp the main items for completing the production increase and savings plan, while also taking into account overall improvements. First, they regard comprehensively learning from Soviet advanced experience, improving operating methods, and improving labor organization as important methods for increasing production and saving. For example, promoting Soviet advanced experience such as labor division specialization and rapid operations can increase labor productivity by 26.2% and save 410 workers. Second, they focus on key projects, such as improving material utilization and greatly reducing waste materials. In addition, they do not underestimate the savings in administrative management expenses. In all departments, everyone is tidying up public items that are not urgently needed and preparing to "hand them in." They say: "Let the public's things flow, so that expenses can be reduced and production costs can be lowered." Factory 53 can save a total of 100 million yuan in enterprise management fees. The amount may seem small, but it is the best and most widespread savings education. Now, in Factory 53, the slogan is "Dig Deep and Search Carefully." Slogans encouraging increased production and savings can be seen in every corner. Blackboards, cartoons, exhibitions, oral broadcasts, large meetings, small meetings... everything is being mobilized to carry out propaganda, encouragement, and ideological education for increasing production and saving, and the morale of the employees is very high.
    Since September, Factory 53 has already incorporated the tasks of the main parts of the production increase and savings plan into the operation plan and organized its implementation. From September 18th, the Production Section has completed the preparation of the October operation plan in accordance with the requirements for increasing production and saving, and distributed it to the workshops for discussion. Various functional sections have also prepared supporting plans. They are nervously seizing the time. A comrade from the Production Section said: "We cannot let go of even one day. If we miss a day, there is a risk that it cannot be made up."
    When discussing increasing production and saving, many comrades are most concerned about truly increasing the country's income through increased production and savings. One comrade said: "The result of our increased production and savings should be reflected in the profits turned over to the state." Factory 53's annual task for turning over profits (including profits and depreciation) is 26.1 billion yuan. In order to achieve this task, they pay great attention to leveraging the role of technical personnel and staff, and strengthening the enterprise's management and operation work, so that it keeps up with, promotes, and guides the development of production.
    First, the work of business departments is oriented towards the workshops, and the Planning Section and Accounting Section conduct comprehensive economic activity analysis to ensure the over-fulfillment of various planned targets. Factory 53 learned from the experience of the Harbin Railway Factory and conducted economic activity analysis pilot projects in the second and third workshops this year. These analytical materials have been of great help in revising the production increase and savings plan this time. Each business section analyzes the workshop's production, costs, capital, labor efficiency, product quality, and other items according to its own business system, and discovers the potential strength of production from them. After each section puts forward a plan, it is submitted to the Accounting Section for balancing, so that it is expressed as a plan to reduce costs and increase output. Now, all sections and workshops attach great importance to cost accounting. This is not only because only by reasonably reducing costs can the task of turning over profits be guaranteed to be completed, but also because the business departments helping the production workshops to calculate production value in a timely manner is the best production propaganda for the workers. When I was talking with comrades from the Accounting Section, a comrade from the Technical Section ran over and said: "Please calculate the economic value of this technical improvement." Everyone is willing to know the economic value created by their labor at any time. The workshop director welcomes the accountant to calculate the workshop's costs and help find problems from the costs. This can enable the workshop director to fully grasp the production situation and complete the plan with a clear understanding. At the same time, it also lays the foundation for the workshop to implement comprehensive economic accounting. In the second workshop, I personally saw accounting cadres helping workers in the pilot process calculate detailed accounts, so that workers can specifically understand the economic value of their production, and thus find potential and discover problems for correction at any time. These situations in Factory 53 show that strengthening economic activity analysis and combining cost accounting with the entire production activity is an important method to ensure cost reduction and the completion of profit turnover.
    Second, the result of Factory 53 accelerating the turnover of working capital guarantees the monthly turnover of profits. Factory 53 stipulated in this revised production increase and savings plan: "Compressing reserve production and circulation funds, reducing the reserve quota by 12.5%, shortening the production cycle by another five days on the original basis, a total of eleven days throughout the year, reducing the backlog of work-in-progress, and achieving an increase in the number of working capital turnovers from the original plan of 4.25 times per year to 5.01 times per year." How to accelerate turnover? They adopted the method of delivering products to customers every two days. Recently, the finished product group has also put forward a rationalization proposal of "one clearing per day" (meaning selling once a day). This spirit of actively handling products is worth learning. In internal management, Factory 53's capital management department also directly manages finished products at the same time, uniformly accelerating capital turnover, calculating workshop and factory-wide costs once a month, and calculating group costs once a week, thereby obtaining the amount to be turned over on time. The monthly figures turned over by Factory 53 are all rising in a straight line. This is the final sign of production results, and it is also a powerful weapon for practically checking production, promoting production, and ensuring the completion of the task of increasing production and saving.
    Finally, it should be pointed out that the most fundamental link in guaranteeing increased production and increased profit turnover is still strengthening planned management and implementing balanced production. Without doing a good job in balanced production, it is impossible to guarantee increased income. If the previous workshop increases the production of work-in-progress, and the next workshop cannot process or assemble it, the total quantity of commercial products in the factory will not increase because of the increased production in some workshops. For this reason, Factory 53 stipulated in the first article of this production increase and savings plan: "Further enrich and improve the operation plan to achieve rhythmic production. On the basis of maintaining a daily equilibrium rate of over 97%, it is necessary to exceed the national plan by 19% (calculated by product quantity)." Under this general principle, they further strengthened the production scheduling responsibility system and various other responsibility systems, and mobilized all forces to ensure the balanced completion of the operation plan.
    The revision and implementation of the production increase and savings plan in Factory 53 are all based on the premise that the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League have the same thoughts and resolutely rely on the working class. This is the basic reason for the success of Factory 53's leadership in production in the past and present. This production increase and savings campaign in the factory has many favorable conditions, such as the vast number of employees having accumulated rich experience in increasing production and saving, improving production management and technical management levels on the basis of implementing planned management, and improving the consciousness of employees on the basis of consolidating labor discipline. These favorable conditions have promoted the relatively rapid development of the production increase and savings campaign in the factory, making it possible for the leadership to grasp the main measures and adopt more scientific leadership methods for the campaign. However, this does not mean that Factory 53 has no difficulties in completing the production increase and savings. On the contrary, there are still many difficulties. All employees of Factory 53 are not afraid of difficulties, and they are full of confidence in breaking through all obstacles and striving to greatly improve production.

    “五百亿”是怎样来的，如何实现？
    ——五三厂增产节约进行情况的介绍
    安岗
    五三厂今年增产节约五百亿元的计划，指导了而且组织了该厂每个人的思想和行动，提高了生产效率。五百亿元是怎样来的呢？五三厂一直是在先进的计划指导下进行生产的。一九五三年的计划生产量比一九五二年增加了百分之四十三，成本比一九四九年降低了百分之四十二。一九五三年该厂的行动计划比国家计划在劳动生产率方面提高百分之二十二，成本方面降低了百分之四，产量方面增加百分之十五。今年七月份，五三厂在加强计划管理、推广先进经验和巩固劳动纪律的基础上，订出增产节约价值四百四十亿元的计划。九月七日至九月十二日，五三厂的同志们又认真地分析了一月至八月完成国家计划的各种资料，找出各种先进的因素，也找出了新的潜力，决定再为国家增产节约六十亿元。全年增产节约共五百亿元。再提前两天半——连前共提前四十二天半完成国家计划。无疑的，这是一个先进的增产节约计划。完成计划的把握在哪里呢？最主要的是从领导干部到工人都心中有数，能够抓住完成增产节约计划的主要项目，同时也照顾到全面的改进。首先他们把全面学习苏联先进经验改进操作方法和改善劳动组织，作为增产节约计划的重要方法。例如推广苏联的劳动分工专业化，快速作业等先进经验，可以提高劳动生产率百分之二十六点二，节省人工四百一十名。其次是抓住主要项目，譬如提高材料利用率，大量减少边料。此外，他们并不看轻节省行政管理费的开支，在各科，大家都把不急需的公用东西整理好准备“上缴”。他们说：“让公家的东西流动起来，就可以减少开支，降低生产成本。”五三厂一共能节省企业管理费一亿元，数目看起来很小，但这是一个最好的最广泛的节约教育。现在在五三工厂，人们的口号是“深挖细找”。各个角落里，都可以看到增产节约的鼓动口号。黑板报、漫画、展览会、口头广播、大会、小会……一切都被动员起来进行增产节约的宣传鼓动和思想教育，职工情绪很高。
    从九月份起，五三厂已经把增产节约计划主要部分的任务列入作业计划内并组织实现。从九月十八日起生产科已将十月份作业计划按照增产节约要求编制完毕，并发到车间去讨论，各职能科也分别编制配合计划。他们紧张地掌握着时间，生产科一位同志说：“我们一天也不能放过，错过一天时间，就有补不上的危险。”
    不少同志谈到增产节约时，最关心的是要真正使国家由于增产节约而增加了收入。有一位同志说：“我们增产节约的结果，应当表现在上缴利润上。”五三厂这次规定的全年上缴任务（包括利润和折旧）是二百六十一亿元。为了实现这个任务，他们十分注意发挥技术人员和职员的作用，加强企业的经营管理工作，使之跟上、推动并指导生产的发展。
    第一、业务部门工作面向车间，计划科和会计科进行全面的经济活动分析，以保证超额完成各项计划指标。五三厂学习哈尔滨铁路工厂经验，今年曾有重点地在第二、第三车间进行经济活动分析试点。这些分析材料对这次修订增产节约计划有很大的帮助。各个业务科按照业务系统各自分析车间生产、成本、资金、劳动效率、产品质量等项目，从中发现生产的潜在力量。各科提出计划后，交由会计科加以平衡，使之表现为降低成本增加产量的计划。现在，各科及车间都很重视成本计算，这不仅是因为只有合理地降低成本才能保证完成上缴利润任务，而且业务部门帮助生产车间及时计算生产价值就是对工人最好的生产宣传。当我同会计科同志谈话时，一位技术科的同志跑来说：“请把这件改进技术的经济价值给计算下来”，大家愿意随时知道自己劳动创造的经济价值。车间主任欢迎会计员去计算车间成本，帮助从成本中发现问题，这可以使车间主任全面掌握生产状况，心中有数地完成计划，同时也给车间实行全面经济核算打下基础。在二车间我亲眼看到会计干部帮助试点工序的工人算细帐，使工人具体了解自己生产的经济价值，从而还可以找出潜力，发现毛病随时改正。五三厂这些情况说明：加强经济活动分析，把成本计算同整个生产活动结合起来，这是保证降低成本完成上缴利润的重要方法。
    第二、五三厂加速流动资金周转的结果，保证了按月上缴利润。五三厂这次增订增产节约计划中规定：“压缩储备生产流通资金，储备定额减低百分之十二点五，生产周期在原订的基础上又缩短五天，全年共十一天，减少在制品积压，作到使流动资金周转次数从原计划每年周转四点二五次提高到每年五点零一次。”怎样加速周转呢？他们采取了两天一次把产品送上门的办法。最近，成品组又提出了“一天一清”（即一天卖一次的意思）的合理化建议。这种积极处理产品的精神是值得学习的。在内部管理上，五三厂掌握资金的部门同时就直接掌握成品，统一地加速资金周转，一月计算一次车间及全厂的成本，每周计算一次小组成本，从而按时地得出上缴的数目。五三厂每月上缴的数字都是直线上升的，这是生产结果最后的标志，也是实际检查生产，推动生产，保证完成增产节约任务的有力武器。
    最后应当指出，保证增产和增加上缴利润最根本的环节还是加强计划管理实行均衡生产。不搞好均衡生产，是不可能保证增加收入的，如果上一车间增产了在制品，下一车间不能加工或装配，结果工厂总的商品产品数量并没有因为某些车间增产而有所增加。正因为如此，五三厂在这次增产节约计划作法第一条上便规定：“进一步充实与改进作业计划，达到有节奏的生产。要在保持日均衡率百分之九十七以上的基础上超过国家计划百分之十九（按产品数量计算）。”在这条总的原则下，他们进一步加强了生产调度责任制及其他各种责任制，动员一切力量保证均衡地完成作业计划。
    五三厂修订和贯彻增产节约计划都是以党、行政、工会、青年团思想一致，坚决依靠工人阶级为前提的。这是五三厂过去和现在领导生产成功的基本原因。该厂这次增产节约运动有着很多有利的条件，如广大职工积累了丰富的增产节约经验，在实行计划管理基础上提高了生产管理和技术管理水平，在巩固劳动纪律基础上提高了职工的觉悟。这些有利条件促使该厂增产节约运动有着比较迅速的发展，领导上有可能抓住主要措施，并对运动可以采取比较科学的领导方法等。但，这并不是说，五三厂完成增产节约就没有困难了，相反的，困难还是很多。五三厂全体职工并不害怕困难，他们充满信心突破一切障碍，争取把生产大大提高一步。
