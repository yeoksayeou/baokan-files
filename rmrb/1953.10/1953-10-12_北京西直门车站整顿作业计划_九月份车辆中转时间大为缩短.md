    Beijing Xizhimen Station Rectification Work Plan
    Vehicle Transfer Time Greatly Reduced in September
    Since the Xizhimen Station of the Beijing Railway Transportation Branch Bureau rectified its work plan in September, work efficiency has greatly improved. Not only has the vehicle transfer time and station stop time been shortened, but also the annual loading task has been completed ahead of schedule and in excess.
    Xizhimen Station is a station where transshipment is greater than unloading, and unloading is greater than loading. An average of 1,200 to 1,300 vehicles are transshipped here every day, 120 to 130 vehicles are unloaded here, and 13 to 14 vehicles of freight are shipped to various places every day. In the past, the work plan was made every six hours. The station dispatcher stayed behind closed doors all day compiling the plan, rarely understanding the situation on the ground. However, the situation on the ground changed greatly in six hours. The duty officer could not execute according to the plan. Often after adjusting one train, he had to ask the station dispatcher how to adjust the next train. In addition, the station dispatcher and the duty officer worked in the same marshalling room with unclear division of labor. The station dispatcher sometimes also arranged the work of the shunting team, creating a chaotic state of work. Duty officer Feng Baohua once reflected: "The station dispatcher is doing the work of the duty officer, and the duty officer is doing the work of the leading hook of the shunting team." Therefore, the station was often congested at that time. The vehicle transfer time was generally 4.2 hours, with a maximum of 4.6 hours for one month. Unloading generally took 18 or 19 hours, with a maximum of 23 hours.
    In late August, the Beijing Railway Transportation Branch Bureau held a meeting, calling on all units to rectify their work plans. After the meeting, Xizhimen Station summarized the reasons for the past plans being mere formalities, held professional meetings with the duty station master, station dispatcher, and duty officer, and with the specific help of the branch bureau's working group, formulated a three-hour work plan. In early September, when it began to be implemented, individual station dispatchers had insufficient understanding in their thinking, and the formulation and execution were not serious. The leadership then helped station dispatcher Yuan Changqing formulate a complete three-hour work plan. The feedback was very good after the implementation of this plan. The shunting driver said: "Today's work is very smooth. Locomotive maintenance and oil pressure can be prepared in advance. In the past, we had no idea about our work." After the plan was implemented, various indicators began to decline from September 13th. The station stop time was reduced to 9.5 hours on the best day, and the transfer time was shortened to 1.9 hours, eliminating the phenomenon of station congestion.
    The issue of division of labor between the station dispatcher and the duty officer was repeatedly discussed at professional meetings, and it was decided to implement the zonal operation method. The duty officer moved to the site and worked with the leading hook of the shunting team in the duty area, and it was decided to start a pilot program with the Zhang Baoxin and Feng Baohua shifts as the focus from September 20th. The results proved that this method was very good. The duty officer could provide the line conditions to the station dispatcher in a timely manner to compile a three-hour work plan. The chaotic phenomenon of two shunting machines operating at one end in the past was eliminated, and the phenomenon of waiting for lines gradually disappeared.
    Since the station rectified its work plan, the branch bureau's loading task of 240 vehicles in September was completed by the 17th, and a total of 419.5 vehicles were completed for the whole month. The annual loading task is 2,555 vehicles, but by the end of September, 2,941 vehicles had already been completed in excess. The planned transfer time is 3.3 hours, and the average transfer time in September was only 2.6 hours. It is estimated that the transfer time saved in September alone has increased the country's production value by 631.3 million yuan.
    Currently, all station employees are enthusiastically discussing the plan to increase production and practice economy. They are preparing to increase the country's loading task by 1,200 vehicles from October to the end of the year. The transfer time set by the branch bureau is 2.8 hours, and they are striving to achieve 2.6 hours. The station stop time set by the branch bureau is 13 hours, and their goal is 12 hours.

    北京西直门车站整顿作业计划
    九月份车辆中转时间大为缩短
    北京铁路运输分局西直门车站，自九月份整顿作业计划后，工作效率大大提高，不但缩短了车辆的中转时间与停站时间，而且提前超额完成了全年的装车任务。
    西直门车站是个中转大于卸车，卸车大于装车的车站。平均每天有一千二百辆到一千三百辆车在这里中转，有一百二、三十辆车在这里卸车，此外每天还要装十三、四辆车的货运往各地。过去的作业计划六小时作一次，车站调度员整天关门编计划，很少了解现场情况。而六小时里现场情况变化很大，值班员按计划执行不通，常常调完一趟车，就得问车站调度员下一趟车如何调。加上车站调度员和值班员同在配车室工作分工不明，车站调度员有时也布置调车组工作，造成工作上的混乱状态。值班员冯宝华就曾这样反映过：“车站调度员作的是值班员的工作，值班员作的是调车组头钩的工作。”因此那时车站经常堵塞，车辆的中转时间一般是四点二小时，最高有一个月到四点六小时，卸车一般也要十八小时或十九小时，最高要二十三小时。
    八月下旬北京铁路运输分局召开会议，号召各单位整顿作业计划。会后，西直门车站即总结过去计划流于形式的原因，召开了值班站长、车站调度员和值班员的专业会议，并由分局工作组具体帮助制订出三小时作业计划。九月初，开始实行时，个别车站调度员在思想上认识不足，制订与执行都不认真，领导上又帮助车站调度员袁长清制订了一个完整的三小时作业计划。这个计划执行后，反映很好。调车司机说：“今天工作很顺利，机车保养、压油都能在事前作好准备工作，过去我们工作没有谱。”计划推行后，自九月十三日起各项指标都开始下降，停站时间最好一天压缩到九点五小时，中转时间缩短到一点九小时，消灭了车站堵塞现象。
    车站调度员和值班员分工问题，经过专业会议反复讨论，决定实行分区作业法，值班员搬到现场，和调车组的头钩在值班区一块工作，并决定自九月二十日起以张宝鑫、冯宝华班为重点试行。结果证明这个办法很好，值班员能及时地把线路情况提供给车站调度员编制三小时作业计划。过去两个调车机在一头作业的混乱现象没有了，等线现象逐渐消灭。
    该车站自整顿作业计划后，九月份分局给的二百四十辆装车任务，到十七日就完成了，全月共完成四百一十九点五辆。全年装车任务是二千五百五十五辆，但到九月底已超额完成了二千九百四十一辆。计划中转时间是三点三小时，九月份平均中转时间只二点六小时。据估计：仅九月份节省的中转时间就给国家增产了六亿三千一百三十万元。
    目前全站职工，正在热烈地讨论增产节约计划，他们准备从十月份起到年底给国家增加一千二百辆装车任务。分局订的中转时间是二点八小时，他们争取作到二点六小时，停站时间分局订的是十三小时，而他们的奋斗目标是十二小时。
