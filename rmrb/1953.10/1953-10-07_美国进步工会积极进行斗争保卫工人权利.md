Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 2nd (TASS dispatch):

    "Labor Newspaper" published an article by Kulikova, describing the growth of progressive forces in the American labor movement. Kulikova wrote: American progressive unions, in spite of insane persecution, are continuing to struggle to defend the vital interests of the working people and to oppose the offensive of monopoly capital. For example, the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America secured a wage increase of 25 cents per hour for workers in the electrical and radio industries last year, so about one hundred factories' workers joined this union last year alone. The Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union carried out a firm struggle to maintain workers' demands for wage increases and improved working conditions. The activities of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union were also successful.
    Kulikova pointed out that American progressive unions are steadfastly exposing the reactionary Taft-Hartley Act, the Smith Act, and the McCarran Act, and demanding the repeal of these laws. They defend the democratic rights of workers and fight for the equal rights of blacks and other minorities. For example, the Fur and Leather Workers Union supported the strike of black fishermen in Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida, and this support determined the victory of this strike, which lasted more than a year.
    Progressive unions advocate labor solidarity, advocate that the American Federation of Labor, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and the entire labor movement take joint action in the struggle to defend the vital interests of the working people and to fight for peace, democracy, and freedom. The demands for peace and international cooperation are enthusiastically supported by the broad masses of working people. Many spontaneous strikes that have erupted everywhere demonstrate the increasingly firm determination of the working people to insist on their vital demands despite the betrayal of splitters. In the first half of this year, more than two million workers participated in strike struggles. The resolutions of many recent union meetings and congresses also illustrate the strength of the progressive forces in the labor movement.
    Kulikova pointed out that significant left-leaning tendencies have also occurred in other unions. The United Packinghouse Workers of America, affiliated with the CIO, published a booklet emphasizing the role of the American labor movement in the struggle for peace. The Textile Workers Union of America, CIO, harshly criticized the policies of the American ruling clique. In a statement, the executive committee of the union emphasized that the distance between the Eisenhower administration and the interests of the broad masses of the American people is growing.
    Kulikova further stated that it is also of great significance that many unions are increasingly forming a united front in opposing the offensive of monopoly capital against the vital rights of the working people. All of this clearly demonstrates the strengthening of progressive forces in the American labor movement, indicating that the American working people are working harder to fight for unity, peace, and democracy.

Xinhua News Agency, New York dispatch: 65,000 longshoremen on the US East Coast strike for improved living conditions.

    On October 1st, 65,000 Atlantic Coast longshoremen belonging to the International Longshoremen's Association began to stop work to demand higher wages. The strike was supported by tugboat workers. The strike has severely affected maritime transport on the Atlantic coast. Shipping in major ports from Maine to Virginia is almost completely paralyzed. In Baltimore, Philadelphia, Boston, and New York, among other places, the shipping work of more than 200 ships has been interrupted. In New York alone, 800,000 workers are directly and indirectly affected by the strike. As of October 5, the strike was still continuing.
    Eisenhower has intervened at the request of the New York Chamber of Commerce and shipowners. On the pretext that the continuation of the strike "will endanger the health and safety of the nation," he ordered the Justice Department to invoke the anti-labor Taft-Hartley Act to stop the strike.
    Meanwhile, on October 3, steelworkers at the Republic Steel Corporation's Corrigan-McKinney plant also began a strike to protest the unreasonable suspension of a worker by the capitalists. About 4,000 workers participated in and were affected by this strike. The strike has completely shut down more than a dozen blast furnaces at the plant.

    美国进步工会积极进行斗争保卫工人权利
   【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二日讯：
  “劳动报”发表了库利科瓦的一篇文章，叙述美国劳工运动中进步力量的壮大。库利科瓦写道：美国进步工会不顾疯狂的迫害，正继续进行保卫劳动人民的切身利益、反对垄断资本的进攻的斗争。譬如，联合电气、无线电与机器工人工会去年为电气及无线电工业的工人争取到了每小时增加工资两角五分，所以，单在去年就有大约一百家工厂的工人加入了这个工会。开采冶炼工人工会进行了坚决的斗争来维护工人的增加工资与改善劳动条件的要求。国际码头与仓库工人工会的活动也是成功的。
    库利科瓦指出，美国进步工会正坚持不渝地揭发反动的塔夫脱—哈特莱法、史密斯法与麦卡伦法，并要求废除这些法律。它们保卫工人的民主权利，为黑人与其它少数民族的平等权利而斗争。譬如毛皮工人工会曾支持弗吉尼亚州、北卡罗来纳州、佛罗里达州黑人渔民的罢工，这种支持决定了这次历时达一年以上的罢工的胜利。
    进步工会主张劳工团结，主张美国劳联、产联以及整个劳工运动在保卫劳动人民的切身利益、争取和平与民主自由的斗争中采取联合行动。和平与国际合作的要求得到广大劳动人民的热烈支持。在各处爆发的许多自发罢工说明，劳动人民不顾分裂分子的背叛行动而坚持他们的切身要求的决心越来越坚决。在今年上半年，有二百万以上的工人参加了罢工斗争。最近的许多工会会议与代表大会的决议也说明了劳工运动中进步力量的强大。
    库利科瓦指出，在其它工会中也发生了可观的左倾倾向。属于产联的美国联合屠宰工人工会发表了一个小册子，着重指出了美国劳工运动在争取和平斗争中的作用。产联纺织工人工会严厉地抨击了美国统治集团的政策。该工会执行委员会在一个声明中着重指出艾森豪威尔政府与广大的美国人民的利益之间的距离越来越大了。
    库利科瓦进一步说，在反对垄断资本对劳动人民切身权利的进攻中，许多工会越来越频繁地形成联合阵线，这也是具有重大意义的。所有这些都明显地说明了美国劳工运动中进步力量的加强，说明美国劳动人民正更加努力来争取团结、和平与民主。
    【新华社六日讯】纽约消息：美国东海岸六万五千码头工人为要求改善生活举行罢工。
    十月一日，属于国际码头工人联合会的六万五千名大西洋岸码头工人开始停止工作，要求提高工资。罢工得到了拖船工人的支持。罢工严重地影响了大西洋岸的海运。从缅因州到弗吉尼亚州，各大港口的航运差不多完全瘫痪。在巴尔的摩，费城，波士顿及纽约等地，二百多艘轮船的航运工作中断。单单在纽约一地，就有八十万工人受到罢工的直接的与间接的影响。到十月五日，罢工仍在继续中。
    艾森豪威尔按照纽约商会和船主的要求已出面干涉。他藉口罢工继续下去“将危害国家的健康和安全”，下令司法部援用反劳工的塔夫脱—哈特莱法制止罢工。
    同时，在十月三日，美国共和钢铁公司科利根—麦肯尼厂的炼钢工人也开始罢工，抗议资方无理宣布一个工人停职。参加这个罢工与受到罢工影响的工人有四千名左右。罢工使该厂的十几个高炉完全停工。
