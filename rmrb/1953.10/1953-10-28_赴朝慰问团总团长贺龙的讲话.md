Dear Comrades:

	Today is the third anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' entry into Korea to fight. The motherland and Chairman Mao have sent the Third Chinese People's Comfort Mission to North Korea to express regards to the most beloved people of the motherland – the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers. Our Comfort Mission includes over five thousand people from all democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, fraternal ethnic groups, overseas Chinese, combat heroes, industrial and agricultural models, families of martyrs, families of servicemen, well-known figures from all walks of life, professors, scientific workers, and literary and artistic workers. First, let me, on behalf of all the Chinese people and our great leader Chairman Mao, extend our cordial greetings and highest respect to all comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers. You have established great merits in the anti-aggression war in Korea and have therefore been loved and admired by the people of the motherland. The honor of the Chinese People's Volunteers is the glory of all the Chinese people.

	You represent the will of the people of the motherland. In the three years of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, safeguarding our homeland, you have promoted a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, demonstrated a high degree of courage and resourcefulness, and a spirit of arduous and tenacious fighting. Fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, you have achieved a great victory in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. This victory is of tremendous significance. First, it fundamentally shattered the United States' imperialist vain attempt to annex all of Korea and then invade our country, defended Korea's independence and China's security, and safeguarded peace in the Far East and the world, thereby ensuring the smooth progress of the motherland's economic recovery and construction work. At the beginning of the war of aggression, the American imperialists were confident that they could use a blitzkrieg, relying on their steel and weapons, to achieve their wild ambitions of occupying all of Korea and then invading China. However, the strength of the Korean and Chinese people is not to be underestimated. In the course of the three-year war, under the conditions of a disparity in military equipment between the enemy and ourselves, we rapidly grew in strength, defeated the first-class army of the largest industrial power in the capitalist world, and drove the enemy back from the Yalu and Tumen Rivers to the vicinity of the 38th parallel. They were confined to the place where they started the aggression and could not move forward any further. The enemy suffered more than one million casualties and direct war costs exceeding 20 billion US dollars, forcing them to accept the armistice. This is a victory of great international significance. It will greatly encourage the struggle of oppressed nations around the world against aggression and encourage the courage and confidence of peace-loving people around the world in striving for lasting peace. This shows that the great victory achieved by the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army not only safeguarded the security of the motherland and the construction of the motherland, but also made a great contribution to the cause of world peace. The victory of the Korean and Chinese people has created favorable conditions for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and further easing international tensions, and has disrupted the US timetable for launching a Third World War. This will have a tremendous impact on the development of the situation in the Far East and the world, and will thus greatly promote the peace movement of people in all countries.

	Secondly, our army has been greatly tempered in the three-year war and has gained rich experience in modern warfare, understanding the bottom line of the American aggressors, which is of inestimable significance to the construction of our modern national defense army. We must see that as long as imperialism exists for one day, our motherland must be vigilant and strictly guard against the enemy's aggressive conspiracies. Therefore, while carrying out large-scale economic construction, we must step up the construction of modern national defense. The rich combat experience of the Chinese People's Volunteers, gained with blood in defeating the US aggressor army, has become a priceless treasure for us to build a modern national defense army.

	The significance of this victory also lies in the fact that, through the great War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the people of our country have universally received a profound education in patriotism and internationalism, which has raised the political consciousness of the people throughout the country and promoted the advancement of the motherland's construction. The people of the motherland use the hardship and glory of the Volunteers to encourage themselves in any work. The soldiers stationed on the border and islands, although they are in a difficult situation in terms of material supply and cultural food, and are burdened with heavy guard tasks, the slogan "Learn from the Volunteers" has encouraged their fighting spirit a hundredfold and heightened their vigilance against the enemy. The troops marching into Tibet who were building roads on the snow-capped mountains as high as 6,000 meters, were facing extremely difficult material conditions and also had to fight against the severe natural environment. The heroic deeds of the Volunteers similarly inspired their courage to overcome difficulties, enlightened their wisdom, improved engineering efficiency, and strengthened their determination to build and defend the frontier. Workers and peasants have taken the heroic behavior and unwavering spirit of the Volunteers as their models, improved their enthusiasm for production, and better completed their increased production plans. Young students have been inspired by the great spirit of the heroic figures of the Volunteers, thereby promoting their progress in their studies and thinking. All of this has formed a huge force, encouraging people across the country to better serve the motherland in their respective jobs. In this way, the construction of all aspects of the motherland is being promoted towards the goal of national socialist industrialization.

	Dear comrades! The people of the motherland and progressive humanity around the world will never forget your great contributions. The victory and glory you have achieved for the motherland, and the contributions you have made to world peace, will shine with eternal brilliance. The people of the motherland are forever proud to have such heroic sons and daughters, and progressive humanity around the world congratulates you with infinite gratitude for your immortal achievements.

	The fundamental reason for the victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers is the justice of the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the high political consciousness and morale of all comrades in the Volunteers. Every soldier has shown great revolutionary heroism and unparalleled heroic, tenacious, and resourceful fighting spirit. The invincible power and great victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers lie in their unity and heroic combat side by side with the Korean People's Army, in the support of all the Korean people, in the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the great leader Chairman Mao, in the wise command of Commander Peng Dehuai, in the support of the people throughout the country, and in the sympathy and support of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. Therefore, our strength is forever invincible.

	Because the victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea safeguarded the peaceful construction of the motherland, the motherland was able to complete social reforms and economic recovery work in the three years. By 1952, the output of major industrial and agricultural products in our country had exceeded the highest annual output in Chinese history. In the recovery of the national economy, the proportion of the socialist state-owned economy has greatly developed.

	On this basis, our country has entered a period of planned construction since this year and has begun the first five-year plan. The general task of our country's planned construction is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country over a fairly long period of time, and to gradually realize the socialist transformation of the country's agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. The basic task of the first five-year plan is: first, to concentrate the main forces on developing heavy industry and to establish the foundation for the country's industrialization and the modernization of national defense; correspondingly, to cultivate construction talents, to develop transportation, light industry, agriculture, and to expand commerce; to promote the collectivization of agriculture and handicrafts in a planned way and to carry out the transformation of private industry and commerce, and to correctly exert the role of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, all of which are to ensure that the proportion of socialist components in the national economy steadily increases, and to ensure that the people's living standards are gradually improved on the basis of developing production. This is the only correct path for China to move forward.

	This year, the first year of the first five-year plan, the total value of industrial production will increase by about 23 percent compared with last year, of which state-owned industry will increase by about 32 percent. In terms of capital construction, the construction of large-scale steel rolling mills and seamless steel pipe plants will be completed this year; installation work will be carried out in six large-scale power stations; more than ten large-scale mechanical industry projects will begin construction and reconstruction, such as automobile manufacturing plants, heavy machinery manufacturing plants, and electrical machinery manufacturing plants; four new cotton spinning factories and two flax raw material factories will be built; and there are many other important construction projects of very large scale. At the same time, we have achieved significant results in implementing this year's production plan. In the first half of this year, the total output value of the five industrial ministries under the central government has exceeded the plan for the first half of the year by 101 percent. Among the main products, steel, pig iron, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth have all overfulfilled the plan. In terms of transportation, railways completed 117 percent of the plan for the first half of the year, and river transportation completed 123 percent of the plan for the first half of the year. Exports in the first half of the year completed 52 percent of the annual plan, and imports also came close to completing the original plan for the first half of the year.

	In our country's economic recovery and economic construction, the assistance of the Soviet Union is of paramount importance. In order to accelerate the construction of our country's industrialization, the Soviet government has decided to provide our country's economic construction with long-term, comprehensive, and enormous assistance. Together with the enterprises that have helped our country design and build in the past three years, by 1959, the Soviet government will help our country build and renovate 141 large-scale projects, including iron and steel joint enterprises, non-ferrous metallurgical enterprises, coal mines, oil refineries, machine manufacturing plants, automobile factories, tractor manufacturing plants, power stations, etc. The Soviet Union will provide us with comprehensive assistance in the construction of these enterprises from beginning to end, and help us train technical personnel. When these enterprises are completed, our country's industrial production capacity will greatly increase, and our country's industrialization will gain a solid foundation. The great Soviet Union's generous and selfless assistance to our country is unprecedented.

	Agricultural production has been restored and exceeded the highest pre-war level last year. Last year, the total grain output increased by 45 percent compared with 1949, and cotton increased by almost two times. Last year, there were 2,219 state-owned farms, 3,663 agricultural production cooperatives, and more than 8.3 million various mutual aid teams across the country. About 40 percent of farmers across the country participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Although some areas in the country suffered from droughts and floods this year, thanks to the efforts of the government and all farmers, the disasters were overcome, and the grain harvest was still equal to last year.

	In the past four years, with the recovery and development of the economy, people's living standards have been initially improved and will continue to be gradually improved. The country's cultural and educational undertakings will also be greatly developed. In the past four years, the number of universities, colleges, and vocational schools has continued to increase, the number of students has soared, and the country's literacy work has also begun. In order to promote the further democratization of the country, universal suffrage has begun to be implemented across the country this year. Local people's congresses at all levels and the National People's Congress can be convened sequentially this year and next year, which will further strengthen the ties between the people's government and the masses of the people, and make the people's democratic dictatorship more consolidated. In order to strengthen national defense, the People's Liberation Army has now established a fairly strong air force, navy, armored forces, and various technical arms. The infantry has also gradually improved its equipment and improved its military quality. The cultural level of the entire army has been greatly improved. Now the entire army has launched regular training focusing on military affairs, moving towards the goal of building a strong modern national defense army.

	Of course, it is not without difficulties to gradually realize socialist industrialization and gradually transition to socialism in a country with a population of more than 500 million. However, we have the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the active efforts and selfless labor of the people throughout the country, the great selfless assistance of the Soviet people, and at the same time, due to the unparalleled superiority of our country's people's democratic system, we are confident to overcome all difficulties and advance the country's construction work according to plan. Now the people and state organs across the country are enthusiastically launching a movement to increase production, increase income, practice strict economy, and reduce expenditure under the call of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao in order to strive to overfulfill the national plan.

	The achievements of the motherland's construction are inseparable from your heroic fighting and glorious victories. The people of the motherland will never forget your contributions to the motherland while enjoying a peaceful and happy life, and will always try their best to support you with gratitude. The people of the whole country are enthusiastically responding to the great call of Chairman Mao to "increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers" to ensure that they continue to do a good job in supporting manpower and material resources. Governments at all levels and the people especially care for the families of the Volunteers, and often carry out the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and the families of revolutionary servicemen. The people across the country regard preferential treatment as a major political task to consolidate national defense and consolidate the armed forces. Under the slogan of "servicemen's families first, then ourselves", the people in urban and rural areas everywhere do everything possible and take all measures to ensure the life and production of the families of martyrs and servicemen. On major festivals, material and spiritual comfort is given to the families of martyrs and servicemen. The families of martyrs and servicemen enjoy free or reduced medical expenses when they are sick. Schools give priority to admitting the children of martyrs and servicemen and give priority to subsidizing scholarships. In cities, the families of martyrs and servicemen generally get employment. In rural areas, a fixed system of land cultivation on behalf of the families of martyrs and servicemen has been implemented. All of this shows the people of the motherland's high level of care and concern for the Volunteers. Of course, there are still some shortcomings in the work of giving preferential treatment in some areas. The government has decided to conduct an inspection of the work of giving preferential treatment this year in order to further strengthen this work.

	Although the Korean War has stopped, it can be seen from a series of actions by the US imperialists recently to undermine the armistice agreement: the enemy will not be reconciled to defeat. US imperialism is systematically keeping the Korean armistice in an unstable state, doing its best to obstruct and sabotage political conferences, and attempting to further undermine the armistice. In order to ensure the thorough implementation of the armistice agreement and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the Chinese and Korean people must also be vigilant and carry out unremitting struggle. The people of the motherland will continue to deepen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in order to consolidate the Korean armistice, strictly prevent the resurgence of the war of aggression, and do their best to help the heroic Korean people heal the wounds of war and restore a peaceful life, until the completion of the Korean people's reconstruction work, until the Korean issue is resolved peacefully. Comrades of the Volunteers, in the past you have promoted the noble spirit of internationalism, fought side by side with the Korean People's Army, and defeated the enemy. In the future, you will surely continue to promote the spirit of internationalism. During your stay in Korea, you will help the Korean government and the Korean people carry out restoration work, heal the wounds of war; cherish the interests of the Korean people, further consolidate and develop the fighting friendship between the people of China and Korea; closely unite with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, firmly defend the armistice line and coastal defense positions, and prevent any aggression and provocation from the other side. If the enemy dares to undermine the armistice, give them a devastating blow and make them suffer a complete failure. The people across the country firmly believe that the heroic comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who have a glorious fighting tradition, will surely live up to the expectations of the people of the motherland and bravely and resolutely complete this glorious task.

	Glory belongs to the Chinese People's Volunteers who defend the motherland, defend peace, and aid the Korean people!

	Eternal glory to the martyrs who sacrificed in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea!

	Long live the Chinese People's Volunteers!

	Long live the unbreakable and permanent friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!

	Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung, the beloved leader of the Korean people!

	Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

### 赴朝慰问团总团长贺龙的讲话

    赴朝慰问团总团长贺龙的讲话亲爱的同志们：
    今天是中国人民志愿军出国作战三周年的纪念日。祖国人民和毛主席派遣了中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团到朝鲜来慰问祖国人民最可爱的人——英雄的中国人民志愿军。我们的慰问团包括各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、各兄弟民族、华侨、战斗英雄、工业和农业模范、烈属、军属、社会各界知名人士、教授、科学工作者和文艺工作者等五千多人。首先让我代表全中国人民和我们的伟大领袖毛主席，向中国人民志愿军全体同志们，致以亲切的慰问与崇高的敬意。你们已在朝鲜反侵略战争中建立了伟大的功勋，因而受到了祖国人民的爱戴和感佩。中国人民志愿军的荣誉，是全中国人民的光荣。
    你们代表了祖国人民的意志，在三年的抗美援朝保家卫国的战争中，发扬了高度的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，发挥了高度的勇敢机智、艰苦顽强的战斗精神，和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，取得了抗美援朝斗争的伟大胜利，这个胜利是有非常巨大的意义的。首先是根本粉碎了美帝国主义并吞全部朝鲜并进而侵略我国的狂妄计划，保卫了朝鲜的独立和中国的安全，保卫了远东和世界的和平，从而保障了祖国经济恢复和建设工作的顺利进行。美国帝国主义者在发动侵略战争之初，满以为仗着它的钢铁和武器，就可以用闪电式的袭击来达到侵占全部朝鲜并进而侵犯中国的狂妄目的。但朝中人民的力量是不可轻侮的，在三年战争的过程中，在敌我双方军事装备悬殊的条件下，我们迅速地生长了力量，战胜了资本主义世界最大工业强国的第一流军队，把敌人从鸭绿江边和图们江边打回到三八线附近。把他们限制在开始发动侵略的地方，再也不能前进一步。使敌人遭受一百多万人的伤亡，直接战费消耗在二百亿美元以上，迫使敌人不得不接受停战。这是一个具有重大国际意义的胜利。这将大大鼓舞全世界被压迫民族反抗侵略的斗争，鼓舞全世界爱好和平人民争取持久和平的勇气和信心。这就说明：中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战所取得的伟大胜利，不但保障了祖国的安全，保障了祖国的建设事业，而且，对于世界和平事业，也作出了巨大的贡献。朝中人民的胜利，为和平解决朝鲜问题和进一步缓和国际紧张局势创造了有利条件，并且打乱了美国发动第三次世界大战的时间表，这对于远东与世界局势的发展，将有巨大的影响，因而也就大大推动了世界各国人民的和平运动。
    其次，我军在三年的战争中受到了很大的锻炼，取得了现代化作战的丰富经验，摸到了美国侵略者的底，这对于我国现代化国防军的建设具有不可估量的意义。我们必须看到：只要帝国主义存在一天，我们祖国就必须提高警惕，严防敌人的侵略阴谋。因此，在进行大规模经济建设的同时，就必须加紧进行现代化国防的建设。中国人民志愿军以鲜血换来的战胜美国侵略军的丰富的作战经验，就成为我们建设现代化国防军的无价之宝。
    这个胜利的意义还在于：通过伟大的抗美援朝运动，使我国人民普遍地受到了深刻的爱国主义和国际主义的教育，提高了全国人民的政治觉悟，推动了祖国建设事业的前进。祖国人民在任何工作中都以志愿军的艰苦与光荣来策励自己。驻守边疆与海岛的战士，虽然他们处于物质供给与文化食粮都很困难的情况下，担负着繁重的警戒任务，而“向志愿军学习”的口号，百倍地鼓舞了他们的斗志，提高了他们对敌人的警惕。进军西藏在高达六千公尺的大雪山上修路的部队，物质条件极端困难，同时还要与严重的自然环境作斗争，志愿军的英雄事迹，同样鼓舞了他们战胜困难的勇气，启发了他们的智慧，提高了工程效率，坚定了建设边疆与保卫边疆的决心。工人和农民，都以志愿军的英雄行为和刚毅精神为楷模，提高了生产的积极性，更好地完成了增产的计划。青年学生们，都受到志愿军英雄人物伟大精神的感召，因而推动了他们在学业上和思想上的进步。这一切，就形成了一个巨大的力量，鼓舞着全国人民在各个工作岗位上更好地为祖国服务。这样，就推动着祖国各方面的建设向着国家社会主义工业化的目标前进。
    亲爱的同志们！祖国人民和全世界进步人类将永远不会忘记你们的伟大功勋。你们为祖国所获得的胜利与光荣，为世界和平所献出的功绩，将闪耀着永世不灭的光辉。祖国人民以有着这样英雄的儿女而永远感到自豪，全世界进步人类也怀着无限感激的心情来为你们所立下的不朽的功绩而祝贺。
    中国人民志愿军获得胜利的根本原因，是抗美援朝斗争的正义性，是志愿军全体同志的高度政治觉悟和士气，每个战士都表现了伟大的革命英雄气概，表现了无比的英勇顽强机智的战斗精神。中国人民志愿军的无敌力量和伟大的胜利，在于和朝鲜人民军团结一致和并肩英勇作战，在于有全体朝鲜人民的支持，在于有中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的领导，有彭德怀司令员的英明指挥，有全国人民的支援，有苏联为首的和平民主阵营的同情和支持。所以我们的力量永远是无敌的。
    由于抗美援朝斗争的胜利保障了祖国的和平建设，使祖国得以在三年中间，完成了社会改革和经济恢复工作。到一九五二年，我国工农业主要产品的产量就已超过了中国历史上的最高年产量。在国民经济的恢复中，社会主义性质的国营经济的比重有了很大的发展。
    在此基础上，我国从今年起进入了有计划的建设时期，开始了第一个五年建设计划。我国进行有计划建设的总任务就是：要在一个相当长的时期内逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。第一个五年计划的基本任务是：首先集中主要力量发展重工业，建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础；相应地培养建设人材，发展交通运输业、轻工业、农业和扩大商业；有步骤地促进农业和手工业的合作化和进行对私营工商业的改造，并正确地发挥个体农业、手工业和私营工商业的作用，所有这些都是为着保证国民经济中社会主义成份的比重稳步地增长，为着保证在发展生产的基础上逐步提高人民生活水平。这是中国向前发展的唯一正确的道路。
    在今年，即第一个五年计划的头一年内，工业生产的总值将比去年增长百分之二十三左右，其中国营工业将增长百分之三十二左右。在基本建设方面，在今年内将完成大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂的建设；将有六个较大规模的电站进行安装工程；将有十个以上较大机械工业的工程开始新建和改建，如汽车制造厂、重型机器制造厂、电气机械制造厂等；将新建四个棉纺工厂，两个亚麻原料厂；还有其他许多规模十分巨大的重要建设工程。同时我们在执行今年生产计划方面已取得了重大的成绩。今年上半年中央五个工业部的生产总值已超额完成了上半年计划的百分之一百零一。在主要产品中，钢、生铁、棉纱、棉布等都超额完成了计划。在运输方面，铁路完成上半年计划的百分之一一七，河运完成半年计划的百分之一二三。上半年出口完成全年计划的百分之五十二，在进口方面也接近完成半年原定计划。
    在我国的经济恢复和经济建设中，苏联的援助具有头等重要的意义，为了加速我国工业化的建设，苏联政府又已决定给我国经济建设以长期的全面的巨大的援助。连同过去三年来帮助我国设计和建筑的企业在内，至一九五九年为止，苏联政府将帮助我国新建与改建一百四十一项规模巨大的工程，其中包括钢铁联合企业、有色冶金企业、煤矿、炼油厂、机器制造厂、汽车厂、拖拉机制造厂、电力站等。苏联将在这些企业的建设方面，从头至尾给我们以全面的援助，并帮助我们培养技术人材。当这些企业建成以后，我国的工业生产能力将大大增长，我国的工业化将获得一个稳固的基础，伟大的苏联给予我国这种慷慨无私的援助是史无前例的。
    农业生产去年即已恢复并超过了战前最高水平，去年粮食总产量比一九四九年增加了百分之四十五，棉花增加了差不多二倍。去年全国已有国营农场二、二一九个，农业生产合作社三、六六三个，各种互助组八百三十余万个。全国约有百分之四十的农户参加了互助合作组织。今年国内虽有部分地区遭受旱灾和水灾，但由于政府和全体农民的努力，克服了灾害，粮食收获量仍和去年相等。
    四年来，随着经济的恢复和发展，人民生活已得到初步改善并将继续逐步得到改善。全国文教事业亦将大大发展。四年来大中学校和专业学校不断增加，学生人数激增，全国扫盲工作也已着手进行。为着促进国家的进一步民主化，今年已开始在全国实行普选，今年和明年即可依次召开地方各级人民代表大会及全国人民代表大会，这样就可进一步加强人民政府与人民群众之间的联系，使人民民主专政更加巩固。为了加强国防力量，人民解放军现已建立了相当强大的空军、海军、装甲和各种技术兵种，步兵亦已逐步改善装备并提高军事素质，全军文化水平得到大大提高，现在全军展开了以军事为主的正规训练，向着建设强大的现代化国防军的目标前进。
    当然，要在一个五亿多人口的国家内逐步实现社会主义工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义，不是没有困难的。但我们有中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，全国人民的积极努力与忘我劳动，苏联人民伟大无私的援助，同时由于我们国家的人民民主制度的无比优越性，我们有把握克服一切困难，把国家建设工作按照计划推向前进。现在全国人民和国家机关正在中国共产党和毛主席的号召下，热烈展开增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支的运动，以争取超额完成国家计划。
    祖国建设的成就，是和你们的英勇作战及光辉的胜利分不开的。祖国人民在享受着和平幸福生活的时候，永远不会忘记你们为祖国立下的功绩，永远怀着感激的心情来尽力支援你们。全国人民都热烈地响应着毛主席提出的“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召保证继续作好人力物力的支援。各级政府和人民特别关怀志愿军战士的家属，经常进行优待革命烈士家属和革命军人家属的工作。全国人民把优抚工作当成巩固国防和巩固部队的重大政治任务。在“先军属，后自己”的口号下，各地城市和农村人民都尽一切努力，采取一切措施，以保证烈属、军属的生活和生产。逢有重大节日，对烈属、军属进行物质上和精神上的慰问。烈属和军属治疗疾病，享受免费或减费的优待。各个学校优先录取烈属、军属子弟，并优先补助助学金。在城市中，烈属、军属普遍得到就业。在农村中，对烈属、军属实行了固定的代耕制度。所有这一切，都表现了祖国人民对志愿军战士高度的爱护与关怀。当然在某些地区优属工作也还存在着一些缺点，政府已决定今年进行一次优属工作的检查，以便进一步加强这一工作。
    现在朝鲜战争虽然已经停止，但是从最近美国帝国主义方面所发生的一系列的破坏停战协定的行动中可以看到：敌人是不会甘心于失败的，美帝国主义正在有计划地使朝鲜停战保持不稳定状态，竭力阻挠和破坏政治会议，并企图进一步破坏停战。为了保障停战协定的彻底实施和争取和平解决朝鲜问题，中朝人民还必需提高警惕，进行坚持不懈的斗争。祖国人民将继续深入地开展抗美援朝运动，来支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，以巩固朝鲜停战，严防侵略战争的再起，并尽力来帮助英雄的朝鲜人民医治战争创伤，恢复和平生活，直到朝鲜人民重建工作的完成，直到朝鲜问题得到和平解决为止。志愿军全体同志们，过去你们发挥了国际主义的崇高精神，与朝鲜人民军共同作战，打垮了敌人，今后你们一定会继续发扬国际主义精神，在留在朝鲜的期间，帮助朝鲜政府和朝鲜人民进行恢复工作，治好战争创伤；爱护朝鲜人民的利益，进一步巩固和发展中朝两国人民的战斗友谊；亲密团结朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，坚守停战线和海防阵地，防止来自对方的任何侵袭和挑衅行为，如果敌人敢于破坏停战，就给以歼灭性的打击，使其遭受彻底的失败。全国人民深信：英雄的有着光荣战斗传统的中国人民志愿军全体同志们，必能不负祖国人民的期望而勇敢坚决地完成这个光荣任务。
    光荣属于保卫祖国、保卫和平和援助朝鲜人民的中国人民志愿军！
    在抗美援朝战争中牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    朝中两国人民牢不可破的永久友谊万岁！
    朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
