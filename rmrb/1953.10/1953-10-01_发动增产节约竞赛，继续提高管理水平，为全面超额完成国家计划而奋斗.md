Launch a Production Increase and Thrift Campaign, Continue to Improve Management Level, and Strive to Comprehensively Exceed the National Plan
沈阳冶炼厂厂长 (Shenyang Smelter Director) Zhang Fan

    The slogan "Increase production, increase income, practice thrift, reduce expenditures, and overfulfill the national plan" has inspired all employees of the Shenyang Smelter to further tap production potential and create more wealth for the country. The plant's employee representative conference decided: On the basis of the 20.6 billion yuan increase in production and savings in the first half of the year, to further increase production and save 66.9 billion yuan, accumulating a super-plan profit of 50.8 billion yuan for the country for the entire year, as a gift to the first year of the country's first five-year plan.

    Is there still potential in production? This is the first question facing all employees. The inspection and summary of the work in the first half of the year gave a positive answer to this question.

    First, with the continuous development of production, potential is also constantly being discovered. By strengthening planning management, we have increased the metal recovery rate of the three main products, copper, lead, and zinc, and improved balanced production from calculating on a ten-day basis to calculating on a daily basis. Based on the increased metal recovery rate alone, costs could be reduced by 2.2 percent in the second half of the year; and because balanced production has been achieved, in addition to ensuring the overfulfillment of the plan, it has also created favorable conditions for continuing to exert equipment efficiency, improve technical and economic norms, and improve product quality. For example, the operating time in the copper reverberatory furnace workshop has been shortened from 72 hours to 66 hours, and the equipment efficiency has increased by 11.6 percent. Therefore, the workshop has proposed a plan to increase production by 48 tons; the zinc electrolysis workshop, under the condition of completing the plan on a daily basis, has achieved a zinc recovery rate exceeding the national plan by 6 percent, a current efficiency exceeding the national plan by 2 percent, and a zinc ingot quality qualification rate of 99.99 percent.

    The facts educate us: It is wrong to be satisfied with overfulfilling the national plan in the first half of the year and not to explore the potential in production any further; being self-proclaimed advanced, thinking that all potential has been exhausted, and not paying close attention to new potential in production development will cause undue losses to the country.

    Second, behind the shortcomings and mistakes in work, there is often deep potential buried. After inspection, we found that there were still many shortcomings in the work in the first half of the year. For example, there were 64 equipment accidents in the plant, more than 20 work stoppages waiting for materials from January to June, and the additional material budget reached as many as 419 times, wasting and hoarding 1.2 billion yuan of state funds; waste materials and mixed ores were thrown around everywhere, wasting a large amount of useful metal.

    These shortcomings have caused undue losses to us in the past work. Once all employees exposed these shortcomings and recognized that they were disasters in production, they were determined to start fighting to eliminate these disasters and were determined to explore this part of the buried potential. For example, in the recent struggle against waste and irresponsibility, employees recovered more than 600 million yuan worth of useful materials such as broken copper, broken lead, and steel, wood boards, etc.

    The facts educate us: We must seriously expose the shortcomings in our work in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism so that potential can be fully tapped; condoning shortcomings and covering up mistakes will waste the potential in production and continue to cause losses to production.

    Third, actively overcoming difficulties is an important task in tapping potential. Difficulties in production will continue to occur. Faced with difficulties, only by taking action to overcome them, and after overcoming difficulties, production has developed forward, and new potential will be tapped. To complete the task of increasing production and practicing thrift in the second half of the year, we have many difficulties in production, the most important of which are insufficient raw materials, old equipment, and some technical problems that have not been resolved.

    We have decided to replace refined ore with a large amount of mixed ore to overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw materials; strengthen equipment maintenance and repair to give full play to equipment efficiency; ensure increased production; and formulate and implement a technical measures plan to gradually solve technical problems. For example, the smelting workshop solved a series of technical problems, and even the waste furnace bottoms buried underground during the puppet Manchukuo era were sent to the blast furnace, and the use of mixed ore reached more than 50 percent of the amount of ore processed, which supplemented the shortage of raw materials.

    The facts educate us: Only by mobilizing all employees to fight against various difficulties can the potential in production be tapped in greater quantities; any attitude of bowing to difficulties and complaining in the face of difficulties is wrong.

    We recognize that the state's launch of the production increase and thrift campaign is not only to increase fiscal revenue, but also requires us to further improve the management level of enterprises through this campaign. At the same time, in order to achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing thrift, we must also adopt the fundamental method of improving enterprise management. Therefore, in addition to continuing to strengthen planning management, we have established a production scheduling job responsibility system and are establishing a technical supply responsibility system, and we also plan to establish an administrative responsibility system, equipment maintenance and repair responsibility system, and technical responsibility system in the fourth quarter.

    In order to do this work well, we will organize all cadres to conscientiously study the Soviet Union's scientific enterprise management methods, especially to learn from the advanced experience of Anshan Iron and Steel in implementing Soviet management methods; we must conscientiously investigate and study the production characteristics of our plant and the problems existing in management, and determine the methods and steps for learning these advanced experiences according to our own situation. We should try our best to ensure that the systems formulated meet the needs of our plant's production, that the various systems are interconnected and serve a common purpose; that each specific task is the responsibility of a dedicated person; and that it is simple and clear, easy for employees to understand and easy to implement. After the system is drafted, we must mobilize the masses to discuss the system, absorb the opinions of the masses for modification, and summarize the advanced experiences created by the masses in implementing the system, and then promote it widely.

    To truly turn the production increase and thrift campaign into a mass movement, we must also carry out sufficient political work. In this regard, we have educated employees about national industrialization, so that all employees further understand the political and economic significance of completing the first annual plan of the country's first five-year plan. Therefore, when discussing the specific figures for production increase and thrift, the leadership originally set it at 50 billion yuan, and the employees decided to increase it to 66.9 billion yuan; and according to the tasks assigned to each workshop, they discussed and formulated specific measures plans for the workshops and groups, and launched a movement to find shortcuts, promote advanced experiences, and develop small-scale mechanization.

    At the same time, we also combined the content of the competition with the piece-rate wage system, established a system of scoring and recording points on a daily and shift basis; appropriately increased the reward rate of various bonuses, and stipulated collective welfare measures in the collective contract, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of employees in the production increase and thrift campaign.

    We believe that through the above efforts, we will definitely be able to complete the production increase and thrift plan. By September 20, we had completed the national plan for the third quarter ten days ahead of schedule as a gift to the great National Day.

### 发动增产节约竞赛，继续提高管理水平，为全面超额完成国家计划而奋斗

    发动增产节约竞赛，继续提高管理水平，为全面超额完成国家计划而奋斗
    沈阳冶炼厂厂长　张凡
    “增加生产，增加收入，厉行节约，紧缩开支，超额完成国家计划”的口号，鼓舞了沈阳冶炼厂全体职工进一步发掘生产潜力，为国家创造更多财富的劳动热情。全厂职工代表大会决定：在上半年已经增产节约二百零六亿元的基础上，再增产节约六百六十九亿元，全年为国家积累五百零八亿元的超计划利润，作为对国家第一个五年计划第一年的献礼。
    生产中还有潜力吗？这是全体职工面临着的第一个问题。上半年工作的检查和总结，对这个问题作了肯定的答复。
    首先，在生产的不断发展中，潜力也在不断地被发掘出来。经过加强计划管理，我们把铜、铅、锌三种主要产品的金属实收率提高了一步，并使均衡生产从按旬计算提高到按日计算的水平。单以提高了的金属实收率计算，下半年就可能降低成本百分之二点二；而由于做到了均衡生产，除了保证超额完成计划外，还给继续发挥设备效能，提高技术经济定额，改善产品质量，创造了有利条件。如铜反射车间操作时间从七十二小时缩短为六十六小时，设备效率提高了百分之十一点六，因此，车间提出了增产四十八吨的计划；锌电解车间在按日完成计划的条件下，电锌实收率超过了国家计划百分之六，电流效率超过了国家计划百分之二，锌锭质量合格率达到百分之九十九点九九。
    事实教育我们：满足于上半年超额完成国家计划，而不再去发掘生产中的潜力是不对的；自命先进，以为所有潜力都已挖光，而不在生产发展中密切注视新的潜力，也会给国家造成不应有的损失。
    其次，在工作中的缺点和错误的背后，往往埋藏着深厚的潜力。经过检查，我们发现上半年的工作中还存在着很多的缺点。如全厂发生了设备事故六十四次，一至六月停工待料二十余次，材料预算的追加竟达四百一十九次之多，浪费和积压了国家资金十二亿元；废料杂矿到处乱扔，浪费了大量的有用金属。
    这些缺点曾在过去的工作中给我们造成不应有的损失。当全体职工一旦揭发了这些缺点，认清了它是生产中的灾害，便决心动手为消除这些灾害而斗争，决心要发掘出这一部分被埋藏着的潜力来。如最近反浪费、反无人负责的斗争中，职工们就回收了价值六亿余元的碎铜破铅及钢铁、木板等有用的材料。
    事实教育我们：必须以批评与自我批评的精神，严肃揭发工作中的缺点，潜力才能充分发掘出来；姑息缺点，掩饰错误，就会糟踏生产中的潜力，继续给生产造成损失。
    第三，积极克服困难，是挖掘潜力的重要工作。生产中的困难总会不断发生的，面对着困难，只有动手去克服，而克服了困难，生产向前发展了，新的潜力便会被挖掘出来。要完成下半年的增产节约任务，我们生产中的困难是很多的，最主要的是原料不足，设备老旧和某些技术问题还没解决。
    我们决定以大量杂矿代替精矿，以克服原料的不足的困难；加强设备的维护检修，以充分发挥设备效率；保证增产；制订与贯彻执行技术措施计划，以逐步解决技术上的问题。如熔炼车间解决了一系列的技术问题，连日伪时代埋在地下的废炉底也送进了鼓风炉，使用杂矿达到了处理矿石量的百分之五十以上，补助了原料的不足。
    事实教育我们：只有动员全体职工，向各种困难作斗争，生产中的潜力才能更大量地发掘出来；任何向困难低头，在困难面前叫苦的态度都是错误的。
    我们认识国家开展增产节约运动，不仅仅是为了增加财政收入，也要求我们通过这个运动，进一步提高企业的管理水平。同时，要达到增产节约的目的，也必须采取改进企业管理这一根本方法。因此，我们除了已在继续加强计划管理的基础上，建立了生产调度工作责任制，和正在建立技术供应责任制之外，还打算在第四季度建立行政专责制，设备维护检修责任制与技术责任制。
    为了作好这件工作，我们将组织全体干部认真学习苏联科学的企业管理方法，特别是学习鞍钢执行苏联管理方法的先进经验；要认真调查研究本厂的生产特点和管理上存在的问题，根据自己的情况，确定学习这些先进经验的方法和步骤。要尽可能做到使所制订的制度切合本厂生产的需要，各项制度相互联系而服务于一个共同目的；每件具体工作都有专人负责；而且简单明了，职工一学就懂，便于执行。在制度拟定之后，要发动群众讨论制度，吸收群众的意见进行修改，并把群众执行制度中所创造的先进经验总结起来，再广泛推行下去。
    要把增产节约运动真正造成群众性的运动，还必须进行充分的政治工作。在这方面，我们对职工进行了关于国家工业化的教育，使全体职工进一步理解了完成国家第一个五年计划的第一个年度计划的政治经济意义。因此，在讨论增产节约的具体数字时，领导上原订为五百亿元，职工们决心增至六百六十九亿元；并根据各车间所分配的任务，讨论制订了车间的和小组的具体措施计划，掀起了找窍门、推广先进经验和开展小型机械化的运动。
    与此同时，我们还把竞赛内容与计件工资结合起来，建立了按日、按班评分记分的制度；适当提高了各种奖金的奖励率，并在集体合同中规定了集体福利的措施，对职工增产节约竞赛的热情给了很大的鼓舞。
    我们相信，经过上述各方面的努力，我们一定可以完成增产节约计划。到九月二十日，我们已提前十天完成了第三季度的国家计划，作为向伟大国庆节的献礼。
