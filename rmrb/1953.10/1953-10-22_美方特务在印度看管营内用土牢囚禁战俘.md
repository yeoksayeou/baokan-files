Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 21st: Wu Mingjun, a Korean People's Army prisoner of war who returned on the 19th, escaped from a dungeon inside a POW camp where U.S. special agents were detaining prisoners. This type of dungeon was originally a form of cruel torture used by U.S. POW camp authorities to persecute prisoners of war. Now, special agents have brought it to the POW camps under the custody of Indian troops.

Wu Mingjun said: Before escaping from the dungeon, he had no idea what a neutral nation custodial camp was, nor did he know when the explanation work had begun, and he didn't even know the number of the POW camp he was in. It was only after he was repatriated that he drew a map of the terrain around the dungeon, and other returnees determined that it was Camp 36.

Wu Mingjun had already been crippled in his left leg due to beatings in the U.S. POW camp. On the third day after entering the Indian troops' custodial camp, he was taken to the dungeon by the Li bandit special agents on the "charge" of wanting to go home. Wu Mingjun remembers that the dungeon was located in a tent in the northwest corner of the camp, which was originally used for POW accommodation. The door of the tent was always tightly closed, and no POW was allowed to approach it. Only special agent "guards" could pass by there. The dungeon was very small, but there were seven other people imprisoned there with Wu Mingjun. Two "guards" armed with bayonets and wooden sticks constantly monitored them in the dungeon, not allowing them to say a word, and they had to be escorted by "guards" to relieve themselves. They could only eat half a bowl of rice and a bowl of salt water sent from outside each meal. Every night around 11 o'clock, the "security captain" would lead "members" in to beat them severely, and they were not allowed to make any sound while being beaten. Once, the "security captain" even stood on Wu Mingjun's stomach and kicked him violently, causing him to faint.

On a night before escaping from the dungeon, Wu Mingjun heard the special agent "battalion commander" and the "security captain" talking outside the dungeon: "This place is really good, no one will know if we kill anyone." Wu Mingjun realized that the special agents were about to do something treacherous, so he decided to find an opportunity to escape. On the morning of the 16th, when he was escorted out by a "guard" to relieve himself, he saw that the camp gate was open, so he mustered up his courage and ran out of the gate, demanding repatriation.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 21st: After the Li Seung-man special agents in the POW camp prevented the POWs from coming out to listen to the explanations on the 16th, they received new instructions from the U.S.-Li bandit gang to intimidate the POWs via the radio. Won Hyo-seop, a Korean People's Army returnee who risked his life to escape from Camp 52 on the 19th and was repatriated, said that according to what he heard from the special agent "squad leader" in the POW camp on the 17th, the content of the instruction was: 1. Korean POWs are not allowed to go out to receive explanations. Li Seung-man "President" has prepared powerful troops, planes, artillery, and tanks, and has advanced two kilometers. If the Indian custodial troops open fire, the "National Defense Forces" will come to "save" you; 2. Li Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek have prepared a large number of "comfort items" to send to you.

Won Hyo-seop said: On the morning of the 17th, several loud explosions of bombs were heard from the U.S. military-controlled area near the POW camp. As soon as the special agents in the camp heard the sound of the bombs, they immediately threatened the POWs, saying, "The United Nations forces are advancing north," and "President Li has ordered an advance north."

Won Hyo-seop said: Since the start of the explanation work, the special agents in Camp 52 have coerced the POWs to "demonstrate" in the square every day, forcing everyone to sing loudly and shout slogans until their voices became hoarse. The special agents threatened that anyone who didn't do so would be a "red element" and would be punished.

The special agent leader threatened every day that whoever went to listen to the explanation would be killed.

Choi Jin-sil, who escaped from the same camp as Won Hyo-seop, also confirmed the facts mentioned above. He also said, "After the special agents stopped the explanation work on the 16th, we all hoped that the neutral nation custodial troops could find a way to take the POWs out, but we never saw any movement. Therefore, we ran out regardless."

### 美方特务在印度看管营内用土牢囚禁战俘

    美方特务在印度看管营内用土牢囚禁战俘
    【新华社开城二十一日电】十九日归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员吴明俊是从战俘营中美方特务禁闭战俘的一座土牢里逃出来的。这种土牢原是美方战俘营当局迫害战俘的酷刑之一，如今特务分子又把它照样搬到印度部队看管下的战俘营。
    吴明俊说：在逃出土牢以前，他一直弄不清什么叫中立国看管营，也不知道解释工作什么时候已经开始，连他所在的战俘营的编号也不知道。直到他在得到遣返后，画出了土牢周围的地形，别的归来人员才断定那是第三十六号营场。
    吴明俊在美方战俘营中早就因遭受毒打，左脚残废。他在进入印度部队看管营后的第三天，就被李匪特务加上想回家的“罪名”，押解到土牢里。吴明俊记得，那个土牢设在营场西北角一个原供战俘住宿的帐篷里，帐篷的门经常紧闭着，任何战俘都不准靠近，只有特务“警备队员”才能从那里经过。这个土牢很小，但是和吴明俊一同被监禁在那里的另外还有七个人。土牢里经常有两个手持刺刀和木棍的“警备队员”监视他们，不准他们说一句话，解大、小便也要由“警备队员”押送。他们每顿只能吃到由外面送来的半碗饭和一碗盐水。每到夜晚十一时左右，“警备队长”还带领“队员”进来毒打他们，打时不准喊出声音。有一次，“警备队长”竟站在吴明俊的肚子上对他猛踢，使他昏死过去。
    在逃出土牢前的一个深夜，吴明俊听到特务“大队长”和“警备队长”在土牢外谈论道：“这地方真好，干掉了谁也不知道。”吴明俊料到特务分子要下毒手了，便打定主意要找机会逃出来。十六日早上，他由一个“警备队员”押着出来解大便时，看见营场的门正开着，他便鼓起勇气奔出大门，要求遣返。
    【新华社开城二十一日电】战俘营中的李承晚特务分子在十六日阻止战俘出来听解释以后，又从电台上收到了美李匪帮新的恐吓战俘的指示。十九日冒着生命危险逃出五十二号营场而得到遣返的朝鲜人民军归来人员元孝燮说，根据他在十七日战俘营中特务“小队长”向大家传达时听到的，这个指示的内容是：一、朝鲜籍战俘一律不准外出接受解释。李承晚“总统”已准备了强大部队、飞机、大炮、坦克，并已向前推进两公里，如印度看管部队开枪，“国防军”就来“救”你们；二、李承晚和蒋介石已准备了大批“慰问品”送给你们。
    元孝燮说：在十七日上午，从战俘营附近美军控制区传来了几声炸弹爆炸的巨响。营场中的特务们一听到炸弹声，就立即恫吓战俘说：“联合国军北进了”、“李总统命令北进了”。
    元孝燮说：自解释工作开始以来，五十二号营场的特务分子胁迫战俘天天在广场上“示威”，要大家高声唱歌、呼口号，一直到把嗓子弄成嗄哑。特务威胁说，谁不这样做就是“赤色分子”，要受处分。
    特务头子天天威胁说，谁要去听解释就杀死谁。
    与元孝燮从同一营场逃出来的崔桢实也证实了上面所说的事实。他还说，“十六日特务使解释工作停顿以后，我们都盼着中立国看管部队能设法把战俘带出去，但是，老是没有看到什么动静。因此，我们就不顾一切地跑出来了。”
