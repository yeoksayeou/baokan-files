(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th) The Military Armistice Commission held a meeting on October 7th. At the meeting, Chief Korean-Chinese delegate General Li Sang-cho delivered a speech, lodging a serious protest against the U.S. side's actions of delaying the construction of explanation sites and opposing the extension of the explanation period, which are acts of sabotaging the agreement (the full text of the protest has been sent by Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, on October 7th), and issued a serious warning against the U.S. side's dispatch of large numbers of secret agents into prisoner-of-war camps to direct them in sabotage activities, as well as the Syngman Rhee government's clamoring and planning to create plots to hijack prisoners of war.

Regarding General Li Sang-cho's proposal, U.S. Chief Delegate Bryan, on the one hand, stated: Understanding the responsibility of maintaining security and order around the prisoner-of-war camps, they will abide by the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," fulfill their responsibilities, and be fully prepared to bear the consequences of their actions. However, on the other hand, disregarding the facts that have been repeatedly exposed by the returning Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and have also been recognized by public opinion in various countries, Bryan flatly denied the U.S. side's dispatch and direction of secret agents to carry out sabotage activities, attempting to reserve ground for the U.S. side to assist and instigate secret agents to abduct large numbers of prisoners of war from the prisoner-of-war camps and sabotage the armistice agreement. At the same time, Bryan stubbornly opposed extending the explanation period and sophistically argued that this was in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" regarding the explanation period.

General Li Sang-cho refuted Bryan's absurd remarks, pointing out: The "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" stipulates that the detaining side should set up all facilities before transferring the prisoners of war to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and, after the transfer of prisoners of war is completed, provide all logistical support according to the requirements of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to ensure that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission performs its tasks and work on schedule. The start and end of the explanation period are stipulated under this premise. However, the U.S. side is currently delaying the construction of explanation sites on the one hand and opposing the extension of the explanation period on the other, attempting to fundamentally sabotage the explanation work, which is a serious violation of the "Terms of Reference." The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has proposed to extend the explanation period in accordance with the right of interpretation conferred by Article 24 of the "Terms of Reference." The U.S. side's attempt to deprive the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission of this right of interpretation is another violation of the "Terms of Reference."

General Li Sang-cho finally reiterated that the U.S. side is not allowed to wantonly sabotage the agreement, and our side will pay close attention to whether the U.S. side immediately takes measures to correct its actions of sabotaging the armistice agreement and the "Terms of Reference."

(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th) On October 8th, Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, on behalf of the commission, sent a letter to General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, pointing out that due to the delay in the construction of explanation facilities, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission believes that the 90-day explanation period should be extended.

### 美方一面拖延修建解释营场一面反对顺延解释期限  我方再次严正警告美方不容肆意破坏协议  中立国遣返委员会主张解释期限应予顺延

    美方一面拖延修建解释营场一面反对顺延解释期限
    我方再次严正警告美方不容肆意破坏协议
    中立国遣返委员会主张解释期限应予顺延
   【新华社开城八日电】军事停战委员会十月七日举行会议。朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在会上发言，对美方拖延解释场所的修建并反对顺延解释期限的破坏协议行动提出严重抗议（抗议全文已见新华社开城七日电），并对美方派遣大批特务进入战俘营并指挥他们进行破坏活动以及李承晚政府叫嚣并策划制造劫持战俘事件的阴谋，提出严重警告。
    对于李相朝将军的提议，美方首席委员勃里安一方面表示：了解维持战俘营周围安全与秩序的责任，将遵照“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，履行职责，并完全准备应承担其行为的后果。但另一方面勃里安竟不顾已为归来的朝中被俘人员一再揭露并也已为各国舆论公认的事实，矢口抵赖美方派遣并指挥特务进行破坏活动的行为，企图为美方协助并指使特务从战俘营劫走大批战俘、破坏停战协定的罪恶阴谋预留地步。勃里安同时仍旧顽固地反对顺延解释期限，并强词夺理地辩解这是符合“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”中关于解释期限的规定的。
    李相朝中将驳斥了勃里安的荒谬言论，指出：“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”规定，拘留一方应在将战俘移交中立国遣返委员会看管前设置一切设备，并在战俘移交完毕后，根据中立国遣返委员会的要求提供一切后勤支援，以保证中立国遣返委员会按期执行其任务与工作，关于解释期限的开始与终止即在此前提下规定的。但美方目前一方面拖延修建解释场所，另一方面反对顺延解释期限，企图根本破坏解释工作，这是严重破坏“职权范围”的行为。中立国遣返委员会已根据“职权范围”第二十四款所赋予的解释权，提出将解释期限顺延，美方企图剥夺中立国遣返委员会此项解释权，是对“职权范围”的又一违反。
    李相朝中将最后重申，不容许美方肆意破坏协议，我方将密切注意美方是否立即采取措施，纠正其破坏停战协定与“职权范围”的行为。
    【新华社开城八日电】十月八日，中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将代表该委员会，致函联合国军总司令克拉克，指出，由于解释设备的延未修建，中立国遣返委员会认为九十天的解释期限应予顺延。
