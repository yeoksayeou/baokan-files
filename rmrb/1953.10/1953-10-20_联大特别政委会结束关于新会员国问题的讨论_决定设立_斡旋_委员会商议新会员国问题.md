Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 16th: The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee concluded its general debate on the question of the admission of new member states to the United Nations on the 13th. At its meeting on the 15th, it voted on proposals and amendments.

At the meeting on the 13th, after the Chairman of the Committee announced the end of the general debate, he asked the representatives to speak on the content of the Soviet proposal to allow five countries to join the United Nations and the Peruvian proposal.

The first speaker, the Cuban representative, made an amendment to the Peruvian proposal, the gist of which was that the "Mediation" Committee should provide a report on its activities to the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Pakistani representative Zhattari stated that the Pakistani delegation would vote in favor of both the Soviet proposal and the Peruvian proposal, as he believed that the two proposals were not contradictory. Zhattari refuted the slanders of the US representative against Albania, Bulgaria, and the Mongolian People's Republic. He expressed his support for the simultaneous admission of fourteen countries, as this would strengthen the United Nations.

American representative Bernath, followed by representatives from the United Kingdom, the Union of South Africa, and Greece, once again opposed the admission of people's democratic countries to the United Nations and opposed the Soviet proposal.

Soviet representative Malik then spoke. He pointed out that the representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Union of South Africa insisted that those signatory states, that is, those signatory states that had concluded treaties with the five countries that the Soviet proposal advocated should be allowed to join the United Nations, did not have mandatory obligations. Malik said that this argument was completely untenable. Malik said that only one conclusion could be drawn from the Committee's discussion: that the vast majority of delegations believed that it was time to stop the enemies of the principle of unanimity of the great powers from attempting to undermine the Charter. The majority believed that a solution to this problem must be sought on a political basis. However, the United States delegation continued to obstruct such a solution.

Malik said: We appeal to all member states of the United Nations: Let us seek a solution to this problem on a broad political basis, and take steps to allow these five countries to join the United Nations. In order to resolve the issue of new member states as soon as possible, the Soviet delegation does not oppose the proposal of the Peruvian delegation and will vote in favor of it. However, the Soviet delegation does not support the amendment proposed by the Cuban delegation, because the purpose of this amendment is to delay the review of this matter and postpone the issue to the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly for resolution.

The Soviet delegation insists that the "Mediation" Committee stipulated in the Peruvian proposal should work during this session of the General Assembly and should provide a report to the General Assembly on its activities.

At the meeting on the 15th, the Committee unanimously adopted the Peruvian delegation's proposal with sixty votes in favor. The amendment to the Peruvian proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation, which stipulated that the "Mediation" Committee should submit a report to the current session of the General Assembly, was not adopted because it did not receive a majority of votes. Subsequently, the Lebanese delegation's amendment to the Peruvian proposal was put to a vote. This amendment stipulated that the "Mediation" Committee should submit a report to the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, or at the latest to the Ninth Session. As a result of the vote, this amendment was passed. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia, India, and twenty other countries voted in favor. The delegations of the United States, the United Kingdom, and eleven other countries voted against. The delegations of France, Pakistan, and twenty-three other countries abstained.

The Peruvian proposal, as amended by the Lebanese delegation, is as follows: Whereas the United Nations General Assembly has reviewed the report of the Special Committee on New Member States; Whereas the universality of membership in the United Nations can only be achieved on the basis of the provisions of the United Nations Charter; Whereas the cooperation of all peace-loving countries can promote the realization of the purposes of the United Nations Charter;

Considering that new efforts to resolve this issue should not restrict the legitimate status of certain member states of the United Nations or further discussion of this issue by the United Nations General Assembly;

1. Decides to establish a "Mediation" Committee composed of representatives of three member states of the United Nations, authorizing them to consult with the members of the Security Council to determine whether it is possible to reach an agreement in order to facilitate the admission of new member states to the United Nations in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the United Nations Charter;

2. Recommends that the "Mediation" Committee submit a report on its work to the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, or at the latest to the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

At the suggestion of the Brazilian delegation, the Special Political Committee unanimously agreed that the "Mediation" Committee should be composed of three member states of the United Nations: Egypt, the Netherlands, and Peru.

Subsequently, the Committee voted on the Soviet delegation's proposal to allow five countries to join the United Nations. Philippine representative Lopez suggested that the Soviet proposal be postponed until after the "Mediation" Committee submitted its report.

Malik said that, in view of the above suggestion, the Soviet delegation did not insist on voting on its proposal and was willing to postpone the vote until after the "Mediation" Committee submitted its report.

The Special Political Committee then concluded its discussion on the issue of new member states.

### 联大特别政委会结束关于新会员国问题的讨论  决定设立“斡旋”委员会商议新会员国问题

    联大特别政委会结束关于新会员国问题的讨论
    决定设立“斡旋”委员会商议新会员国问题
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社纽约十六日讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会已于十三日结束了关于新会员国加入联合国问题的一般辩论，并在十五日会议上就提案和修正案进行了表决。
    在十三日会议上，委员会主席宣布结束一般辩论后，即要求代表们就苏联所提准许五个国家加入联合国的提案和秘鲁提案的内容发言。
    第一个发言的古巴代表对秘鲁提案作了修正，大意是“斡旋”委员会应向联合国第九届大会提供关于它的活动的报告。
    巴基斯坦代表奇哈特里表示，巴基斯坦代表团将投票赞成苏联提案和秘鲁提案，因为他认为这两个提案并不矛盾。奇哈特里驳斥美国代表对阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚和蒙古人民共和国的诬蔑。他表示赞成准许十四个国家同时加入，因为这样会加强联合国。
    美国代表贝尔纳斯和继起发言的英国、南非联邦和希腊代表再度反对准许人民民主国家加入联合国，并反对苏联提案。
    苏联代表马立克接着发言。他指出：美国、英国和南非联邦等国代表硬说那些签字国，即曾和苏联提案所主张准许加入联合国的五个国家缔结了和约的签字国，他们所担负的义务并不是强制性的。马立克说，这种说法完全不能成立。马立克说，从委员会的讨论中只能得出一个结论，那就是绝大多数代表团认为现在是制止大国一致原则的敌人企图来破坏宪章的时候了。大多数代表认为，必须在政治基础上寻求解决这个问题的办法。但是美国代表团继续阻挠这样来解决问题。
    马立克说：我们向联合国的一切会员国发出号召：让我们在广泛的政治基础上谋求这个问题的解决，并采取步骤准许这五个国家加入联合国。苏联代表团为了尽早使新会员国问题获得解决，并不反对秘鲁代表团的提案，而且将要投票赞成它。可是，苏联代表团不赞成古巴代表团对提案所提出的修正，因为这修正的用意，旨在拖延对这事的审查，而把这问题推迟到联合国第九届大会上去解决。
    苏联代表团坚持秘鲁提案中所规定的“斡旋”委员会应在本届大会期间进行工作，并应向大会提供关于它的活动的报告。
    在十五日会议上，委员会以六十票赞成一致通过了秘鲁代表团的提案。苏联代表团所提出对秘鲁提案的修正案，即规定“斡旋”委员会应向本届大会提出报告，由于没有得到多数票赞成而未获通过。接着把黎巴嫩代表团对秘鲁提案的修正案提付表决，这个修正案规定“斡旋”委员会向第八届大会、或至迟向第九届大会提出报告。表决结果，通过了这一修正案。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、印度等二十三个代表团投票赞成。美、英等十一个代表团投票反对。法国、巴基斯坦等二十三个代表团弃权。
    经黎巴嫩代表团修正后的秘鲁提案如下：鉴于联合国大会已审查过了特别委员会关于新会员国问题的报告；鉴于只有以联合国宪章条款为基础，才能达到联合国会员国资格的世界性；鉴于所有爱好和平国家的合作，能促使联合国宪章的宗旨得以实现；
    考虑到解决这个问题的新的努力，不应使某些联合国会员国的合法地位及联合国大会进一步讨论这个问题受到限制；
    一、决定设立一个由联合国的三个会员国代表组成的“斡旋”委员会，授权他们与安全理事会理事国商量，确定是否有可能达成协议，以便于根据联合国宪章第四条的规定，准许新会员国加入联合国；
    二、建议“斡旋”委员会向联合国第八届大会、或至迟向联合国第九届大会，提出关于其工作的报告。
    在巴西代表团的建议下，特别政治委员会一致通过“斡旋”委员会应由埃及、荷兰和秘鲁三个联合国会员国组成。
    接着，委员会表决苏联代表团要求准许五个国家加入联合国的提案。菲律宾代表洛佩兹建议，把苏联的提案延迟到“斡旋”委员会提出报告后再提付表决。
    马立克说，鉴于上述建议，苏联代表团不坚持要对它的提案进行表决，而愿意把表决延迟到“斡旋”委员会提出报告以后。
    特别政治委员会随即结束了新会员国问题的讨论。
