    Further Strengthening the Unity and Struggle of the World's Working Class
    Tan Wenrui
    The Third World Trade Union Congress began in Vienna on October 10th. This World Trade Union Congress is convened under the circumstances of the unprecedented upsurge in the struggle of the world's working class and the increasing consolidation of unity. The main tasks of the congress are: to unite the workers of the world more closely in united action to defend their vital interests, to strengthen and consolidate the international ties between workers of all countries, and to formulate a common program for united action. This will undoubtedly have a very significant meaning for the further strengthening of the unity and struggle of the world's working class.
    Since the Second World Trade Union Congress was held in 1949, the working people of the countries in the peaceful and democratic camp, headed by the Soviet Union, have further improved their material and cultural living standards through selfless labor, and are moving forward with full confidence towards the future of building socialism and communism. At the same time, in capitalist and colonial countries, due to the frantic pursuit of maximum profits by international monopoly capital and the preparation for a new world war, the situation of the working masses in various countries is deteriorating. The burden of military expenditure weighs heavily on the workers, taxes are increasing, prices are constantly rising, real wages are falling rapidly, and the number of unemployed is increasing day by day. Business owners are forcing workers to work longer hours and implement a speed-up system, while working conditions are extremely harsh, workers' health and safety are not guaranteed, and accidents increase every year. In order to suppress workers' resistance, the ruling groups of various countries have formulated and promulgated anti-labor laws, arbitrarily deprived workers of their democratic rights, and persecuted the staunch fighters and leaders of workers' movements in various countries.
    The working people of capitalist and colonial countries, in order to oppose this increasingly intolerable situation, have launched increasingly fierce struggles. The working masses of various countries are increasingly clearly aware that the interests, rights, hopes and goals of the entire working class are common, and their main demands are: to raise wages, full employment, implement effective social insurance, enjoy the right to education and vocational training, improve housing conditions, abolish anti-labor legislation, guarantee trade union rights and democratic rights, and safeguard national independence and peace; at the same time, they are also increasingly clearly aware that only through united struggle can they defend their interests and rights and achieve their hopes and goals. Therefore, the working masses of various countries are increasingly moving towards unity and unified action in the struggle. This has become the main characteristic of the struggle of the working class in capitalist and colonial countries in the recent period.
    In this regard, the working people of Italy and France have shown a brilliant example. The national general strike held by eight million workers in Italy on September 24th prominently demonstrated the high degree of unity of the Italian working people. Because they dared not violate the will of the vast membership, the trade union organizations of the Italian Christian Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party also had to take unified action with the Italian General Confederation of Labor. The August general strike in France, in which five million workers participated, also had the same characteristics. In this great struggle, the ranks of workers in all walks of life were closely united, and workers belonging to different trade union federations formed hundreds of unified action committees, persisted in the strike action, and shattered the conspiracies of some reactionary trade union leaders to prevent workers' unity. In many other capitalist and colonial countries, the trend of the working class striving for unified action and unity is also growing. In Japan, the working people are increasingly closely united on the common basis of striving for national independence. Since the beginning of this year, regional and industrial unified strikes have become a common phenomenon. At the Fourth National Congress of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan held in July this year, progressive forces defeated the divisive activities of right-wing elements, enabling the congress to pass resolutions supporting the peace movement and opposing the anti-strike law. In countries such as India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Ceylon, there has also been progress in the movement of workers striving for and demanding unified action. The joint strike held by 500,000 plantation workers in Ceylon in January this year is a clear sign of workers strengthening unified action. In Latin America, unified national trade unions have been organized in Guatemala, Chile, and Bolivia, and the solidarity movement in countries such as Brazil and Argentina is also being strengthened.
    Due to the strengthening of unity, the working people of capitalist and colonial countries have achieved great victories in the struggle to improve living standards and strive for democracy, freedom, and peace. They have not only defended their vital interests, but also打击 [dǎ jī - struck] the war plans of international monopoly capital groups. Last year, the 650,000 steel workers in the United States persisted in a 54-day strike, forcing the capitalists to make some concessions to the workers' demands for increased wages, and causing great losses to the United States' military production; last year, the national general strike of more than one million working people in Belgium打击 [dǎ jī - struck] the conspiracy of the United States to force the people of Western Europe to accept the extension of military service; the increasingly vigorous struggle of millions of Japanese workers became an important reason for the downfall of the Yoshida government in April this year; France's August general strike挫败 [cuò bài - thwarted] the French government's conspiracy to implement anti-labor policies by means of emergency measures decrees, and forced the government to release the imprisoned leaders of the labor movement.
    The working classes and the broad masses of people of the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries express deep sympathy for the united struggles of the working classes of various capitalist and colonial countries. The people of the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries and the working people of various capitalist countries have further strengthened their unity in the struggle to defend peace and oppose war, which has played a huge role in easing international tensions.
    Recently, international tensions have been initially eased due to the realization of the Korean armistice. However, international reactionary forces are trying their best to continue to maintain international tensions and promote a policy of arms expansion and war preparation. This is the root cause why the living conditions of the working classes in various capitalist and colonial countries cannot be improved and continue to deteriorate. Therefore, the working people of various countries feel even more urgently that they must strengthen unity in order to strive to improve their living standards and strive for peace. This legitimate desire of theirs has been supported by the World Federation of Trade Unions, which truly represents the interests of the working class, which has made the call for strengthening international trade union unity unprecedentedly high among the working classes of capitalist and colonial countries. Those trade union organizations in Europe, Asia, and the Americas that have been separated from the World Federation of Trade Unions due to the divisive activities of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" not only strongly demand the restoration of unity, but are also establishing contact with the World Federation of Trade Unions, and they actively participate in the meetings of the industrial departments of the World Federation of Trade Unions.
    It is precisely because of this new development in the international situation and the international workers' movement that the international reactionary groups are actively instructing a small handful of trade union scabs to intensify their sabotage and division of the working class's unity cause. The reactionary leaders of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" recently once again rejected the World Federation of Trade Unions' proposal to take joint action in the struggle for peace and the working class. At the Third Congress of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" held in July, the chairman of the American "CIO," [Congress of Industrial Organizations] Reuther, even openly clamored: "We must work hard on the social and economic fronts to combat communism - and if necessary, we can also take up arms." This kind of words and deeds can only further expose them as enemies of the world's working class and cannot weaken the will of the working masses of various countries to strengthen international unity in the slightest. Many trade unions in Britain and Scandinavia have held meetings one after another and passed resolutions demanding that the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" cooperate with the World Federation of Trade Unions; twelve trade unions in Finland and some other factory trade unions have also written to the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" demanding that it take measures to restore international trade union unity. The Japan Private Railway Workers' Union Federation and the National Railway Workers' Union, which have hundreds of thousands of workers, have withdrawn from the organization due to dissatisfaction with the policies of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions"; and the Guatemalan Trade Union Federation and others have decided to join the World Federation of Trade Unions. These facts show that an increasingly wide range of workers have recognized that the World Federation of Trade Unions is the banner of their united struggle.
    The workers' strong desire to strengthen international unity is more prominently manifested in the fact that they warmly welcomed the convening of the Third World Trade Union Congress and actively prepared for and participated in the meeting. Because they understand the great significance of this conference for the world's working class to strengthen unity and struggle. Trade union organizations from ninety-six countries, including more than one hundred trade union centers and trade union organizations that did not participate in the World Federation of Trade Unions, expressed congratulations and support to the conference. At the conference, representatives from various countries unanimously advocated strengthening international unity and taking unified action to carry out the struggle to improve living conditions and strive for democracy, freedom, and peace.
    The working masses of the whole world are watching the progress of the Vienna Conference with great enthusiasm and firmly believe that this conference will definitely be able to victoriously complete its historic mission.

    全世界工人阶级团结和斗争的进一步加强
    谭文瑞
    世界工会第三次代表大会已于十月十日起在维也纳开始举行。这次世界工会代表大会是在全世界工人阶级斗争空前高涨和团结日益巩固的情况下召开的。大会的主要任务是：更紧密地把全世界工人团结在统一行动中以保卫他们的切身利益，加强和巩固各国工人间的国际联系，并制订一致行动的共同纲领。这对于世界工人阶级团结和斗争的进一步加强，无疑有着极其重大的意义。
    自从世界工会第二次代表大会于一九四九年举行以来，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营各国的劳动人民，以忘我的劳动进一步提高了自己的物质和文化生活水平，满怀信心地向着建设社会主义和共产主义的前途迈进。与此同时，在资本主义和殖民地国家，由于国际垄断资本疯狂地追求最大限度的利润并准备新的世界战争，各国工人群众的处境愈来愈为恶化。军费的负担沉重地压在工人的身上，捐税日益加重，物价不断上涨，实际工资迅速下降，失业人数与日俱增。企业主强迫延长工作时间并实施赶快制度，同时劳动条件极端恶劣，工人的健康和安全都没有保障，事故年年增加。为了镇压工人的反抗，各国统治集团制订和颁布了反劳工的法律，肆意剥夺工人的民主权利，迫害各国工人运动的坚强斗士和领导者。
    资本主义和殖民地国家的劳动人民为了反对这种愈来愈难以容忍的情况，展开了日益猛烈的斗争。各国工人群众愈来愈清楚地认识到：全体工人阶级的利益和权利、希望和目标都是共同的，大家的主要要求都是：提高工资、充分就业、实行有效的社会保险、享受教育和职业训练的权利、改善居住条件、废止反劳工立法、保障工会权利和民主权利、维护民族独立与和平；同时他们也愈来愈清楚地认识到，只有团结斗争，才能保卫自己的利益和权利，达到自己的希望和目标。因此各国工人群众在斗争中日益走向团结和统一行动。这已成为最近一个时期资本主义和殖民地国家工人阶级斗争的主要特点了。
    在这方面，意大利和法国的劳动人民显示了光辉的范例。今年九月二十四日意大利八百万工人举行的全国总罢工，突出地表现了意大利劳动人民高度的团结一致。由于不敢违背广大会员的意志，意大利天主教民主党和社会民主党的工会组织也不得不与意大利总工会采取一致行动。法国五百万工人参加的八月大罢工，也具有同样的特点。在这次伟大的斗争中，各行各业的工人队伍团结得极为紧密，属于不同工会联合会的工人组成了好几百个统一行动委员会，坚持了罢工行动，并粉碎了一些反动工会头子阻止工人团结的阴谋。在其他许多资本主义与殖民地国家中，工人阶级争取统一行动和团结的趋势也日益增长。在日本，劳动人民在争取民族独立的共同基础上愈来愈紧密地团结起来，今年以来地区性和产业性的统一罢工已成为普遍现象。在今年七月间举行的日本工会总评议会第四次全国大会上，进步势力击败了右翼分子的分裂活动，使大会通过了支持和平运动、反对禁止罢工法等决议。在印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和锡兰等国家，工人争取与要求统一行动的运动也有了进展。锡兰五十万种植工人今年一月举行的联合罢工，就是工人加强统一行动的鲜明标志。在拉丁美洲，危地马拉、智利和玻利维亚都组织了统一的全国性工会，巴西、阿根廷等国的团结运动也正在加强。
    由于团结的加强，资本主义和殖民地国家劳动人民在争取改善生活水平、争取民主、自由与和平的斗争取得了很大的胜利，他们不仅保卫了自己的切身利益，而且打击了国际垄断资本集团的战争计划。去年美国六十五万钢铁工人坚持五十四天的大罢工，迫使资方不得不对工人增加工资的要求作了若干的让步，并使美国的军事生产受到很大的损失；去年八月比利时一百多万劳动人民的全国总罢工，打击了美国强迫西欧人民接受延长兵役期限的阴谋；数百万日本工人日益蓬勃的斗争，成为吉田政府今年四月倒台的重要原因；法国的八月大罢工挫败了法国政府想借紧急措施法令来实行反劳工政策的阴谋，并使政府不得不释放了被囚禁的劳工运动的领袖。
    苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的工人阶级和广大人民对各资本主义及殖民地国家工人阶级的团结斗争，表示深切的同情。苏联、中国和各人民民主国家人民和资本主义各国劳动人民在保卫和平反对战争的斗争中，已经进一步加强了团结，这对于国际紧张局势的缓和起了巨大的作用。
    最近国际紧张局势由于朝鲜停战的实现，已经有了初步的缓和。但是，国际反动势力正竭力企图继续保持国际紧张局势，并推行扩军备战的政策。这是各资本主义和殖民地国家工人阶级生活状况还不能得到改善，并继续恶化下去的根本原因。因此，各国劳动人民更迫切地感到必须加强团结，以争取提高生活水准和争取和平。他们这种正当的愿望，受到了真正代表工人阶级利益的世界工会联合会的支持，这就使得要求加强国际工会团结的呼声在资本主义和殖民地国家工人阶级中空前地高涨起来。欧洲、亚洲和美洲各国的那些由于“国际自由工会联合会”的分裂活动而与世界工联隔离的工会组织，不仅强烈要求恢复团结，而且正在与世界工联建立联系，它们积极参加世界工联产业部的会议。
    正是因为国际形势和国际工人运动的这种新发展，国际反动集团便积极指使一小撮工贼加紧进行破坏和分裂工人阶级的团结事业。“国际自由工会联合会”的反动头子，最近再度拒绝世界工联主张在争取和平和工人阶级斗争中采取共同行动的建议。在七月举行的“国际自由工会联合会”的第三次代表大会上，美国“产联”主席路德甚至公然叫嚣：“必须在社会和经济的战线上努力工作以打击共产主义——如果需要，也可以拿起武器。”这种言行只能更加暴露了他们是世界工人阶级的敌人，丝毫不能削弱各国工人群众要求加强国际团结的意志。英国和斯堪的那维亚的许多工会纷纷举行会议，并通过决议要求促使“国际自由工会联合会”与世界工联合作；芬兰的十二个工会和其他一些工厂工会并写信给“国际自由工会联合会”，要求它采取恢复国际工会团结的措施。拥有数十万工人的日本私营铁道工会联合会和国营铁道工会，由于不满“国际自由工会联合会”的政策，已退出了这个组织；而危地马拉工会联合会等则已决定参加世界工联。这些事实说明了愈来愈广泛的工人群众，已经认识了世界工联是他们团结斗争的旗帜。
    工人们强烈要求加强国际团结的愿望，更显著地表现在他们热烈地欢迎世界工会第三次代表大会的召开，并积极筹备和参加了这次会议的事实上面。因为他们了解这次大会对于世界工人阶级加强团结和斗争的重大意义。九十六个国家的工会组织，其中包括一百多个没有参加世界工联的工会中心和工会组织向大会表示了祝贺和支持。在大会上，各国代表一致主张加强国际团结，以统一行动去进行争取改善生活条件，争取民主、自由与和平的斗争。
    全世界的工人群众都正以巨大的热情，注视着维也纳大会的进行，并坚信这次大会一定能够胜利地完成它的历史性的任务。
