Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 7th: Our special correspondent Wu Min reports: The whole world is now closely watching whether the U.S. is preparing to tear up the Korean Armistice Agreement and undermine the Korean armistice.

    Syngman Rhee and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang have been hysterically threatening and clamoring against the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission with increasing frenzy in recent days. The Syngman Rhee bandit gang has openly declared that it will sabotage the armistice agreement and seize the captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese side from the custody of the Indian guard troops. According to a Seoul dispatch published in the British "Daily Telegraph" on October 5th, a plan has been drawn up to "make all prisoners of war guarded by the Indians escape collectively." The dispatch said, "This matter will probably happen within the next few days. According to news from the Korean side, arrangements have been made to take the Chinese prisoners of war to the coast. There, they will be transported away by ships of the Chinese Kuomintang." As for the Korean prisoners of war, they will be detained by the Syngman Rhee bandit gang in the same way as they forcibly detained 27,000 prisoners of war on June 18th.
    
    Obviously, this plan to seize prisoners of war is being plotted with the support and assistance of the U.S. side. Just one fact is enough to prove this. Cho Jeong-hwan, the acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, submitted a protest to Major General Thorat, commander of the Indian guard forces, on the 4th, threatening to send armed forces to drive the Indian troops out of Korea. This protest letter was forwarded by General Taylor, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army. This clearly shows the collusion between the U.S. military authorities and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. At the beginning of this month, Rankin, the U.S. ambassador to the Taiwan bandit gang, made a special trip to Korea for a few days of "vacation," visited Munsan, and attempted to enter the prisoner-of-war camps. This is clearly related to the conspiracy to arrange the seizure of captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    
    In order to enable the Syngman Rhee bandit gang to realize this conspiracy to seize prisoners of war, the U.S. is now constantly exerting pressure on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, attempting to distort Article 3 of the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" regarding the prohibition of the use of force against prisoners of war, so that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission will not stop the Syngman Rhee bandit gang when it seizes prisoners of war. At the same time, American news agencies have been instructed to distort the remarks made by Chairman Thimayya of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission at a press conference on the 6th, insisting that Thimayya guaranteed that he would not stop prisoners of war from "escaping collectively." This lie has been exposed by an Indian spokesperson today. The purpose of the American news agencies in spreading this lie is to allow the special agents in the prisoner-of-war camps to hear it from the radios they brought in, encouraging them to more boldly coerce the prisoners of war to cooperate with the Syngman Rhee bandit gang's conspiracy to seize prisoners of war.
    
    People here pointed out that before the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, Harrison, the chief representative of the U.S. in the negotiations, gave a guarantee to the Korean and Chinese side on July 16th, saying: "I assure you again that we have obtained the necessary guarantees from the Government of the Republic of Korea that it will not in any way hinder the implementation of the terms of the draft armistice agreement." Before this, on June 29th, Clark said in a reply to Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai: "Where necessary, the United Nations Command will do its best to establish military defense measures to ensure that the terms of the armistice will be observed." Now, in order to avoid the complete bankruptcy of its conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war, the U.S. is actually supporting and assisting the Syngman Rhee bandit gang in plotting to seize prisoners of war, attempting to sabotage the agreement on the prisoner-of-war issue in the armistice agreement. Now people have every reason to question the U.S. authorities that if the U.S. does not want to undermine the Korean armistice, it must abide by the guarantees it has already made; if the U.S. continues to support Syngman Rhee's provocative conspiracy, then they must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

### 美方支持李承晚预谋劫夺朝中被俘人员

    美方支持李承晚预谋劫夺朝中被俘人员
    【新华社开城七日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：全世界现在都在密切注视着：美方是不是准备撕毁朝鲜停战协定，破坏朝鲜停战。
    李承晚和蒋介石匪帮在最近几天内越来越疯狂地对中立国遣返委员会发出歇斯底里的恫吓和叫嚣。李承晚匪帮公然声称要破坏停战协定，从印度看管军手中劫夺朝中被俘人员。据十月五日英国“每日电讯报”刊载的汉城通讯说，这样的一个“使所有由印度人看管的战俘集体逃跑”的计划已经拟定。通讯说，“这件事情大概会在今后几天之内发生。根据朝鲜方面的消息，把中国战俘带到海边的安排工作已经做好了。他们将在那里被中国国民党的船只运走。”至于朝鲜籍战俘，则将被李承晚匪帮以六月十八日强迫扣留二万七千名战俘的同样办法扣留下来。
    很明显，这样一个劫夺战俘的计划是在美方的支持和协助之下策划出来的。只要举出一个事实就可以证明这一点。李承晚匪帮的外务部代理长官曹正焕在四日向印度看管部队司令托拉特少将提出一份抗议，威胁说要派遣武装部队把印度部队赶出朝鲜。这封抗议信是由美军第八军军长泰勒转交的。这清楚地说明了美国军事当局与李承晚匪帮之间的勾结。在本月初，美国驻台湾匪帮的大使兰金特地到朝鲜去度了几天“假期”，访问了汶山，并且企图进入战俘营。这显然是与安排劫夺中国人民志愿军被俘人员的阴谋有关。
    为了使李承晚匪帮这一劫夺战俘的阴谋得以实现，美方现在正在对中立国遣返委员会不断施行压力，企图曲解“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第三款关于不得对战俘使用武力的规定，使中立国遣返委员会在李承晚匪帮劫夺战俘时不加阻止。同时，美国的通讯社被授意歪曲中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅六日在记者招待会上的谈话，硬说蒂迈雅保证在战俘“集体逃跑”时不加阻拦。这个谎话今天已经被印度发言人揭穿。美国通讯社散布这个谎话其目的是要让在战俘营里的特务们从他们带进去的收音机里听到，鼓励他们更加大胆地挟持战俘，来和李承晚匪帮劫夺战俘的阴谋互相配合。
    此间人士指出，在朝鲜停战协定签字之前，美方谈判首席代表哈利逊曾在七月十六日向朝中方面提出保证说：“我再次向你们保证，我们已从大韩民国政府获得必要的保证，即：它将不以任何方式阻挠停战协定草案条款的实施。”在此以前，六月二十九日，克拉克在给金日成元帅和彭德怀将军的复信中曾说：“遇有必要之处，联合国军将尽其所能建立军事上的防卫措施，以保证停战条款将被遵守。”现在美方为了避免它的强迫扣留战俘的阴谋彻底破产，居然支持和协助李承晚匪帮策划劫夺战俘，企图破坏停战协定中关于战俘问题的协议。现在人们完全有理由质问美国当局，如果美方不是想破坏朝鲜停战，就必须遵守他们所已经提出的保证；如果美方继续支持李承晚的挑衅阴谋，那末他们必须对因此而产生的一切后果负全部的责任。
