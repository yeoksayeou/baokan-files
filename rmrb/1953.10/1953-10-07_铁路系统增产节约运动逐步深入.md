Xinhua News Agency, October 6th: The railway system's campaign to increase production and practice economy has gradually deepened. Based on the good completion of the plan from January to August this year and the continued strong supply of goods in the next three months, the thirteen railway administrations nationwide and the Kunming Railway Bureau have formulated plans to increase production and practice economy. As of September 20th, the total amount of increased production and economy planned by the national operating railways had reached 35.6 trillion yuan, exceeding the Ministry of Railways' plan by more than 2.6 trillion yuan. The First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, and the locomotive and rolling stock repair factories in Changxindian, Harbin, Qishuyan, and other places have also formulated plans to increase production and practice economy. After exceeding the annual plan of 200 billion yuan for increasing production and practicing economy in July, the Harbin Electric Section of the Harbin Railway Administration formulated a plan in mid-September to hand over an additional 150 million yuan in profits to the state. Gaoshanzi Station of the Jinzhou Railway Administration also formulated a plan to load an additional 1,000 cars by the end of the year after completing the annual loading plan four months ahead of schedule.

Now, the broad masses of railway workers have actively taken action to strive to fully and overfulfill the annual plan and the plan to increase production and practice economy. In late September, the Harbin Railway Administration convened its first representative conference of advanced workers. The 714 advanced workers who participated in the conference formulated and adopted 32 guarantee conditions. They guaranteed that in the fourth quarter's competition to increase production and practice economy, they would implement and promote the Soviet Denikov dispatching method, Shmilev station dispatching method, Mamidov car delivery method, Li Xikui shunting method, Li Shaoqiang coal-saving operation method, Shcheblykin and Xue Xilin high-quality train rapid repair method, and Yin Zhaokun Luning locomotive maintenance experience, etc., according to their respective businesses, to drive the employees of their units to work hard to complete this year's national plan and the plan to increase production and practice economy. The employees of the temporary business department affiliated to the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways have formed a work group to open up sources of goods along the Tianlan Railway and extended the transportation of petroleum from the Yumen Oil Mine, which was originally transported from the Longquansi Station of the Lanxin Railway, to the Dachaigou Station. It is estimated that this will increase temporary business income by 62.3 billion yuan by the end of this year, accounting for 39% of the total increased production and economy of the entire engineering bureau. Workers in the Wushaoling work area of the Lanxin Railway changed the original plan of transporting sand and gravel from distant places, implemented local sourcing, and saved the state more than 1 billion yuan in project costs. The freight car workshop of the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory strengthened the inspection system and labor discipline at the beginning of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and the time to manufacture a new freight car was reduced from four and a half days to three days. Liu Fulai, stationmaster of Yanggao Station, Zhangjiakou Branch of the Beijing Railway Administration, and Zhai Jinyong, station attendant, used the "mechanical packaging" method to skillfully load more, increasing the loading capacity of each car of grain and grass from eight tons to twelve tons. After the station promoted this method in the first half of this year, it has already saved the equivalent of 65 operating cars, accumulating more than 162.2 million yuan in wealth for the country. After the start of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the station's employees strived to further increase the loading capacity to 20 tons per car. In September, the employees of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway implemented fast loading and unloading, and earnestly promoted the Li Xikui shunting method, which greatly improved the vehicle turnaround rate. The stations also strengthened contact with the consignment units, so that the road's September transportation business plan was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded. In addition, the Jinan Railway Administration has also overfulfilled the third quarter transportation plan.

    铁路系统增产节约运动逐步深入
    【新华社六日讯】铁路系统的增产节约运动已逐渐深入展开。全国十三个铁路管理局和昆明铁路局，根据今年一到八月份计划完成得好和今后三个月内货源仍很旺盛的情况，订出了增产节约计划。到九月二十日止，全国营业铁路所订增产节约的总数已达到三万五千六百多亿元，超过铁道部所订计划二千六百多亿元。铁道部第一工程局，长辛店、哈尔滨、戚墅堰等机车车辆修理工厂也都订出了增产节约计划。哈尔滨铁路管理局哈尔滨电务段在七月份就已超额完成二亿元的年度增产节约计划后，九月中，他们又订出了再给国家多缴利润一亿五千万元的计划。锦州铁路管理局高山子站也在提前四个月完成全年装车计划后，又订出了到年底再多装一千车的计划。
    现在，广大铁路职工已积极行动起来，争取全面超额完成全年计划和增产节约计划。哈尔滨铁路管理局九月下旬召开了首届先进工作者代表大会，参加大会的七百一十四名先进工作者制订和通过了三十二项保证条件。他们保证在第四季度的增产节约竞赛中，按本身业务分别贯彻和推广苏德尼果夫调度法、什米列夫站调度法、马米多夫取送车法、李锡奎调车法、李绍强省煤操纵法、什车布力金及薛喜林高质量列车快速检修法以及尹兆坤鲁宁机车保养经验等等先进工作方法，带动本单位职工为完成今年国家计划和增产节约计划而努力。铁道部第一工程局所属临时营业部门的职工，已组成工作组到天兰铁路沿线各地开辟货源，并将原来从兰新铁路龙泉寺车站起运的玉门油矿的石油，延长到打柴沟车站起运。这样到今年年底，预计可增加临时营业收入六百二十三亿元。占全工程局增产节约总数的百分之三十九。兰新铁路乌鞘岭工区的工人，改变原来需要从远地运砂石的计划，实行就地取材，为国家节省了工程费十亿多元。戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂货车车间，在增产节约运动一开始就加强检查制度和劳动纪律，新造一部货车的时间就从四天半减少到三天。北京铁路管理局张家口分局阳高站站长刘福来、站务员翟金用“机械包装”法巧载多装，使每车谷草装载量由八吨提高到十二吨。该站在今年上半年推广这个方法后，就已经节省了等于六十五辆运用车，给国家积累了一亿六千二百多万元财富。增产节约运动开始后，该站职工争取把装载量再提高到每车二十吨。成渝铁路职工九月份实行快装快卸，并认真推广李锡奎调车法，大大提高了车辆周转率；各车站并加强和托运单位的联系，使全路九月份的运输营业计划提前超额完成。此外，济南铁路管理局也已超额完成了第三季度运输计划。
