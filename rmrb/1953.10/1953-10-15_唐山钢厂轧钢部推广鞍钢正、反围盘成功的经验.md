Tangshan Steel Plant Rolling Mill Successfully Promotes Anshan Steel's Positive and Negative Coiling Disc Experience

Huang Yulin, Zhang Yiming

After the People's Daily published the successful experience of Anshan Steel's small rolling mill in testing the reverse coiling disc in December 1952, the technical personnel and workers of the Tangshan Steel Plant Rolling Mill enthusiastically requested to learn from Anshan Steel's advanced experience. With the support of the Party committee and administrative leadership, five technical personnel and workers, led by the deputy director of technology of the Rolling Mill, were selected to study at Anshan Steel on January 21 this year. After returning from their studies, a meeting was immediately convened to discuss how to quickly promote Anshan Steel's experience. A specific plan for testing and promotion was also formulated. Subsequently, three tests were conducted at the end of March, mid-April, and mid-July, totaling one hundred and two hours. Finally, the 16mm and 19mm positive and negative coiling discs were successfully produced. It was officially put into production on July 16.

In the initial stage of production, the effect was not significant because the workers were not skilled in operating the coiling disc and the technical personnel had not fully understood the performance of the coiling disc. However, since August, the production of the coiling disc has become increasingly normal, and production has increased sharply. From August 1st to 20th, the output exceeded the plan by 13.2%, and all quality quotas exceeded the targets. The production tasks were completed in a comprehensive and balanced manner, with a balance rate of 99.3%.

The reason why Tangshan Steel Plant was able to successfully promote Anshan Steel's positive and negative coiling disc experience and put it into production smoothly is mainly due to the following points:

I. Technical personnel closely integrate with workers, find problems and think of solutions in the actual process of testing and promotion, and give full play to their creativity.

After learning the experience of Anshan Steel's positive and negative coiling discs, the technical personnel of Tangshan Steel Plant combined it with their own equipment and other conditions to creatively develop it. For example, in terms of the coiling disc itself, Anshan Steel's coiling disc was a whole piece cast by sand casting. When designing the coiling disc, the technical personnel of Tangshan Steel Plant proposed to change the coiling disc to a two-section installation. Facts have proved that this can avoid moving the entire coiling disc when adjusting the machine within 100 mm, and only one side needs to be moved. This reduces the difficulty of adjusting the machine and greatly shortens the time for adjusting the machine, increasing the operating rate. For example, Anshan Steel's funnel horn is square, and Tangshan Steel Plant's was also square, but it was found during the test that the square shape easily got stuck in the steel, so the size of the mouth was changed to a circle, and the length was also increased, so that it could straighten the steel strip to a certain extent and play an auxiliary role in the steel strip entering the groove. In the process of testing and promotion, the technical personnel also put forward many improvement methods. In addition to actively thinking of solutions themselves, the technical personnel also closely integrated with the workers. Each test was jointly controlled by technical personnel and workers. After the test, a technical symposium was immediately held for technical personnel, team leaders, and technical workers. The problems in the test and improvement methods were studied, so that the workers could find rules and tricks around the problems in the test, and some technical problems could be solved more rationally.

II. The test is carried out in a planned, prepared, and responsible manner.

After the technical personnel and workers of Tangshan Steel Plant returned from studying at Anshan Steel, they immediately formulated a specific plan for testing and promoting the positive and negative coiling discs, and designated special personnel to carry out the design and manufacture. During the test, the technical group made a clear division of responsibilities, and the deputy director of technology of the Rolling Mill was responsible for overall control, and the testing situation of each coiling disc was recorded by the technical trainees. The workers were also organized in certain operating positions according to their technical ability, so that the entire test was carried out in an orderly manner. The reason why the third test was successful and could be put into production immediately was also inseparable from the full preparation in advance. The technical group considered in advance that after the positive and negative coiling discs were officially put into production, the workers would not be skilled in operation, so it was decided to organize all the technical personnel of the Rolling Mill to carry out special duty. The duty technicians should find the cause of the coiling disc's malfunction, help the workers adjust the machine, teach the workers how to operate at any time during the duty, and be responsible for exchanging operating experience and心得 with each other during the handover. This makes production gradually normal and grasps the actual performance of coiling disc production.

III. The timely formulation of new operating procedures is an important factor for the normal production of the coiling disc after it is put into production.

In the initial stage of putting the coiling disc into formal production, although there were technicians on duty every shift, the production was still not normal, and the three shifts operated inconsistently. Some shifts were better, and some shifts always had problems. Therefore, the tasks that should have been completed had not been completed until July 28. The major problem facing us is that we must immediately formulate a new and practical operating procedure for the coiling disc, so that everyone's operation can be followed. The technical group took on this mission, but coiling disc production was also a new subject for the technical personnel of Tangshan Steel Plant, and it was impossible to come up with a perfect operating procedure immediately. The technical group made up for this shortcoming by mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses. In addition to the technical personnel's own research and finding experience and operational precautions during actual duty, they especially emphasized the use of technical symposiums to exchange the experience that workers had already confirmed in actual operation. Since production is constantly going on, it is impossible to wait until the operating procedures are very complete before they are promulgated and implemented. The technical group adopted the method of formulating, implementing, and enriching at the same time. Based on the opinions that everyone initially affirmed, a draft of the operating procedures was drafted before the end of July, specifically stipulating several coiling disc adjustment and coiling disc operation precautions, and immediately implemented it. In addition to regular operating procedure education, four formal studies have been organized so far. Because this operating procedure comes from actual practice and from the experience and心得 of the masses, the workers are happy to implement it. Having practical operating procedures that are mastered by the masses can ensure the normal progress of production.

IV. The Party's political and ideological work guarantees the successful promotion of positive and negative coiling discs.

After Anshan Steel's reverse coiling disc was successfully tested, most of the employees of Tangshan Steel Plant Rolling Mill enthusiastically requested to learn and promote it. However, positive and negative coiling discs are ultimately new things for Tangshan Steel Plant, so there are still many ideological obstacles in the entire promotion process: First of all, workers with lower technical levels have concerns. They are afraid that after the coiling disc is successfully tested, fewer people will be needed for small rolling mills, and they will be transferred to work, so they take a negative attitude in the testing process. In the initial stage of putting the coiling disc into production, the tasks were always not completed, and some workers lost confidence, saying "It is slower to roll with the coiling disc than without it"; even individual workshop leaders were afraid of not completing the production tasks and wanted to remove the coiling disc and still use manual production. In response to this situation, the Party branch first criticized the conservative ideas of individual leading cadres at the branch committee meeting, and universally checked the incorrect understanding of the test promotion of positive and negative coiling discs at the Party and Youth League group meetings. The trade union also held a symposium for team leaders, technical personnel, and model workers to talk about their experiences in promoting the coiling disc. After full deliberation and discussion, a general meeting of all workshop employees was convened to report on the production situation since the promotion of the coiling disc experience, criticize the existing wrong ideas, and put forward the slogan "Mechanization is our direction of struggle, we must learn from Zhang Mingshan's creative spirit and strive for complete mechanization". In addition to the propaganda and mobilization by Party members, Youth League members, and propagandists and the use of big-character posters, blackboards, and other methods, different mobilization slogans were put forward for the problems existing in each work section. In July, each Party member formulated a plan to complete the national plan and unite the masses to do a good job in coiling disc production according to the requirements of the branch, leading the workers to revise the group convention, ensuring the smooth promotion and success of the coiling disc, and completing the national plan for July five hours ahead of schedule.

After the successful promotion of positive and negative coiling discs in Tangshan Steel Plant, great achievements have been made in production. But we must not be complacent about this. Even now, the coiling disc itself is not perfect enough, and the operating procedures still need to be further enriched and revised. In particular, after the positive and negative coiling discs are put into production, production has increased a lot, and most of the past quotas have become invalid. To correctly compile production plans and organize and guide production according to hourly instructions, we must find various new quotas as soon as possible. At present, it is also found that the capacity of the reheating furnace is insufficient compared with the rolling mill, and the labor force for shearing and bending steel is also unbalanced. This requires not only measuring the hourly output of the rolling mill, the life of the rolls, grooves, and bearings, but also measuring the existing capacity of the reheating furnace for shearing and bending steel for balanced adjustment.

The successful promotion of positive and negative coiling discs in Tangshan Steel Plant Rolling Mill is only the first step on the road to mechanization and automation. Now Tangshan Steel Plant Rolling Mill has formulated a plan to continue to test and promote vertical coiling discs, automatic guidance devices, reheating furnace pushing machines, electric guide plate automatic cutting machines and other automation devices within this year, and designated special personnel to be responsible for carrying out, in order to continue to strive for complete mechanization and automation of the production process.

    唐山钢厂轧钢部推广鞍钢正、反围盘成功的经验
    黄裕麟、张一鸣
    一九五二年十二月，人民日报发表了鞍钢小型轧钢厂试验反围盘成功的经验后，唐山钢厂轧钢部的技术人员和工人都热情奋发地要求学习鞍钢这一先进经验。在党委和行政领导方面的支持下，选派了以轧钢部技术副主任为首的五个技术人员和工人，于今年一月二十一日到鞍钢学习。学习归来后，立即召开了会议，研究如何把鞍钢经验很快地推广。并订出了具体的试验、推广计划。接着在三月底、四月中旬、七月中旬先后试验了三次，共计试验了一百零二小时。终于使十六公厘、十九公厘的正、反围盘都获得成功。在七月十六日已正式投入生产。
    在投入生产初期，因工人对掌握围盘操作还不熟练，技术人员对围盘性能也没有摸透，所以效果还不显著。但自八月以来，围盘生产日趋正常，生产便急剧上升。八月一日至二十日产量比计划超过百分之一十三点二，质量定额全部超过指标。全面均衡地完成了生产任务，均衡率为百分之九十九点三。
    唐山钢厂所以能将鞍钢的正、反围盘经验推广成功并顺利投入生产，主要有如下几点经验：
    一、技术人员紧密与工人结合，从实际试验、推广过程中找问题、想办法，发挥了创造性。
    唐山钢厂技术人员学习了鞍钢正、反围盘的经验以后，又在鞍钢经验的基础上结合自己的设备等条件，加以创造性的发挥。例如以围盘本身来说，鞍钢的围盘是用翻砂翻出来的整个儿的一个，唐山钢厂在设计围盘时，技术人员便提出把围盘改成为二节安装的建议，事实证明：这样可以在一百公厘以内调整机器时不必把整个围盘挪动，只要动一边就行了，这就减少了调整机器时的困难，并大大缩短了调整机器的时间，增加了作业率。又如，鞍钢的漏斗的喇叭是方形，唐山钢厂的原来也是方形，但试验过程中发现方形容易卡钢，就把大小口都改为圆形，长度也加大，使它能在一定程度上将钢条扶正，对钢条进槽起了辅助作用。在试验推广过程中，技术人员还提了许多改进办法。技术人员除自己积极想办法以外并紧密和工人结合。每次试验都由技术人员和工人一起掌握，试验完毕立即召开技术人员、班组长、技术工人的技术座谈会。研究试验中的问题及改进办法，使工人能围绕试验中的问题寻规律、找窍门，也使一些技术问题得到了更合理的解决。
    二、有计划、有准备、有专人负责地进行试验。
    唐山钢厂技术人员、工人从鞍钢学习归来后即订出了试验和推广正、反围盘的具体计划，指定了专人进行设计和制造。在试验进行中，技术组作了明确的专责分工，并由轧钢部技术副主任负总责，全面掌握，每个围盘试验情况皆由技术练习生负责记录。工人也都各按技术能力组织在一定的操作岗位上，使整个试验有条不紊地进行。
    第一次试验正围盘尚好，反围盘没有成功。他们在技术座谈会上找出了原因和办法之后，又立即分别指定专人负责解决。由于事事有专人负责，保证了试验能顺利进行。而第三次试验成功后能立即投入生产，也是与事先有了充分准备分不开的。技术组事先考虑到正、反围盘正式投入生产后，工人操作必不熟练，就决定把轧钢部所有技术人员都组织起来进行专责值班，值班技术员要发现围盘产生毛病的原因，帮助工人调整机器，在值班时要随时教会工人如何操作，交接班时要负责互相交流操作经验和心得，这就使生产能逐步正常，并掌握住围盘生产的实际性能。
    三、及时制订新的操作规程是围盘投入生产后能正常生产的重要因素。
    围盘正式投入生产初期，虽然每班皆有技术员值班，但生产仍不够正常，三班操作也不一致，有的班尚好，有的班就总出毛病，因此直到七月二十八日还没有完成应完成的任务。摆在眼前的一个重大问题，就是必须立即制订出一套围盘操作的新的切实可行的操作规程，使大家的操作能有所遵循。技术组负起了这个使命，但围盘生产对唐山钢厂技术人员来说也是一个新的课题，也不能马上拿出一套完美的操作规程来，技术组以发动群众依靠群众来弥补了这个缺点，除了技术人员自己研究并在实际值班中，找经验、找操作应注意的事项以外，特别重视了利用技术座谈会的形式，交流工人在实际操作中已经肯定的经验。由于生产在不断进行，不可能等操作规程很完备以后再颁布实行，技术组采取了边制订、边贯彻、边充实的办法，根据大家初步肯定的意见，在七月底以前起草了一个操作规程草案，具体规定了若干条围盘调整和围盘操作注意事项，并立即贯彻执行。除经常的操作规程教育以外，到目前为止已正式组织了四次学习。由于这个操作规程来自实际，来自群众的经验和心得，工人是乐于执行的。有了切合实际并为群众所掌握的操作规程便能保证生产的正常进行。
    四、党的政治思想工作保证了正、反围盘的推广成功。
    鞍钢反围盘试验成功后，唐山钢厂轧钢部大多数职工都热烈地要求学习和推广。但正、反围盘在唐山钢厂来说终究是个新事物，因而在整个推广过程中仍有不少思想障碍：首先就是技术水平较低的工人有了顾虑，他们怕围盘试验成功以后小型轧钢机要的人少了，他们就要被调动工作，因而在试验过程中抱着消极态度。围盘投入生产初期任务总完不成，有些工人就丧失了信心，说“装了围盘还比不装轧得慢”；甚至有个别的车间领导干部也怕完不成生产任务，要把围盘拆掉，仍旧用手工来生产。党支部针对这种情况，首先在支委会上批判了个别领导干部的保守思想，并在党和青年团的小组会上普遍检查了对试验推广正、反围盘中的不正确认识。工会也召开了班组长技术人员及劳动模范的座谈会，漫谈对推广围盘的体会。经过充分的酝酿讨论，又召开全车间职工大会，报告了推广围盘经验以来的生产情况，批判了存在的错误思想，并提出“机械化是我们的奋斗方向，要学习张明山的创造精神，争取全部机械化”的口号，除了党员、团员、宣传员进行宣传和利用大字报、黑板报等进行宣传鼓动外，并针对各工段存在的问题分别提出不同的鼓动口号。七月份每个党员都根据支部要求订出自己完成国家计划和团结群众搞好围盘生产的计划，带动工人修订了小组公约，保证了围盘的顺利推广成功，并提前五小时完成了七月份的国家计划。
    唐山钢厂正、反围盘推广成功后，在生产上取得了很大的成绩。但我们决不能以此自满。即以目前来说，围盘本身做得还不够完美，操作规程仍须继续加以充实修正，特别是正、反围盘投入生产后，生产提高很多，过去定额大多失效，要正确地编制作业计划，按小时指示来组织生产，指导生产，必须及早找出各项新的定额。目前并发现再热炉能力与轧钢机相比已显得不足，剪断弯钢的劳动力也不平衡，这就不仅要测定轧钢机的小时产量，轧辊轧槽、轴瓦等的寿命，还须测定再热炉剪断弯钢等的现有能力，予以平衡调整。
    唐山钢厂轧钢部正、反围盘的推广成功，只不过是在机械化自动化的道路上走了第一步。现在唐山钢厂轧钢部已订出了计划，准备在今年以内继续试验推广立围盘、自动诱导装置、再热炉推出机、电动导板自动切断机等自动化装置，并指定了专人负责进行，为继续争取生产过程全部机械化自动化而奋斗。
