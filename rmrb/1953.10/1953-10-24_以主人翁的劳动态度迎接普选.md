    Welcoming the General Election with the Labor Attitude of a Master
    Creating More Wealth for the Country
    The grassroots election work in each district of Fushun City concluded at the end of August. A total of 325 electoral districts in factories, mines, government offices, streets, and schools held election meetings, and elected 591 representatives to the District People's Congress.

    In this election, many model workers were elected as representatives. Among the 84 representatives from the Open-pit Mining Area, 49 were workers, including 20 model workers such as Zhang Zifu, Kong Xiangrui, Xie Youde, and Zheng Huaishan. Model workers accounted for 30 percent of the 114 representatives elected in the Shengli District of the Open-pit Mining Stripping Section.

    In the general election, the workers used abundant labor enthusiasm to create more wealth for the country. Workers in the Fushun Open-pit Coal Mine initially proposed "Signing a good collective contract to welcome the general election"; after the collective contract was signed, they took practical actions to ensure the implementation of the contract.

    Tens of thousands of workers were involved in the production competition upsurge. The coal mining section put forward 113 important issues related to production, and mobilized workers to study and solve them. The workers of the "Old Day Shift" took the lead in solving 103 items in five days; the second and third shift workers were not far behind, completing a month's production task 18 days ahead of schedule. Workers in the overhaul workshop of the North Electromechanical Plant of the Open-pit Mine adopted a assembly line method, increasing the monthly overhaul of locomotives from 15 to 22; the attendance rate of the stripping section was 92.3 percent in June, and increased to 95 percent in July.

    Model Workers Elected as Representatives
    The machine workshop of the Fushun State-owned Electromechanical Plant held a meeting of voter groups.

    The head of the voter group introduced the resume of representative candidate Zhang Yuanzeng at the meeting. He said: "Zhang Yuanzeng was a poor boy since he was a child. He went to the factory as an apprentice at the age of fourteen. After the liberation of Fushun, Zhang Yuanzeng created a new production record. In 1950, he completed a production task that would have taken three days in three hours. Since 1951, he has led a production team, and the monthly production efficiency has reached more than 110 percent. Last year, he completed 116 percent of the team's annual increase in production and savings plan in five months. Zhang Yuanzeng has been rated as a special model worker in Fushun City for three consecutive years..."

    The voter group leader's words were interrupted before he finished. Tong Changfu, a worker from the line marking group, said: "Zhang Yuanzeng not only takes the lead in production, but also cares very much about the suffering of the workers. One night, worker Yin Chengxiu suffered from acute gastroenteritis, and his life was in danger, requiring urgent blood transfusion. That day, it happened to be Zhang Yuanzeng on duty, and he unhesitatingly gave Yin Chengxiu his blood, saving his life."

    Zhang Yuanzeng was finally elected as a representative.

    Good News from the "General Election Dedication Platform"
    On the "General Election Dedication Platform" of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, news of workers dedicating to the general election can be seen every day. Old technical worker Chen Fuwen said to his partners after receiving his voter card: "This is the victory fruit of our revolutionary struggle for more than 30 years! We should produce well!" He overcame the slackening phenomenon. When he was making sand boxes, he used his brains and tried to transform tools, improving production efficiency and saving more than a thousand man-hours. The workers of the forging team in the fourth workshop were even more energetic, using the achievement of completing the annual production plan ahead of schedule as a gift to the general election.

    A Young Female Turner's Determination
    Tian Min is a young female worker in the factory of the Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. When she first entered the factory, she was still a child. Over the years, under the cultivation and education of the Party, she has gradually improved her class consciousness and is now a glorious member of the Communist Youth League. With the help of her comrades, her skills have also improved, and she has recently been promoted from apprentice to formal turner. In the general election, she thought of her current shortcomings in production: due to the lack of proficiency in operation, the rejection rate of a certain product reached 4 percent, and the production volume was not high.

    When she thought of this, she felt very uneasy. The question, "How should I treat the general election?" has been in her mind. At a general election discussion meeting, she expressed to the comrades of the whole group: "The general election is for us workers to be masters of our own affairs. If we want to be masters of our own affairs, we must have the appearance of being masters of our own affairs. I must improve production."

    Tian Min faithfully fulfilled her oath, actively learning techniques from others, and studying hard. She used to produce only 40 to 50 of a certain product a day, but now she has increased it to 70 to 80 (reaching a maximum of 100); the rejection rate has also been reduced.

    Sending a Congratulatory Letter to the "Boring and Turning Team" Workers
    One day, while the workers of the boring and turning team in the second workshop of the Shenyang Air Compressor Factory were in production, a bed suddenly broke down, and production was about to stop. Everyone in the team thought that this was a dedication to the general election, and they would never allow production to be affected. On the spot, they unanimously decided to move the parts to another lathe. Although the task was heavy, the team successfully completed the task by tapping into their potential.

    One noon, the boring and turning team suddenly became lively. Lu Yiqian, the director of the workshop, led a group of people carrying a blackboard, beating gongs and drums towards the workshop. Shao Zhenhai, the leader of the boring and turning team, happily took the blackboard. He saw the words "Congratulatory Letter" written in red chalk on the blackboard, with congratulatory words written below. The Party branch, the administrative leadership, and the Youth League branch of the workshop also jointly sent a congratulatory letter to the boring and turning team, congratulating all the comrades for improving their sense of being masters of the country in the general election and successfully completing their production tasks.

### 以主人翁的劳动态度迎接普选

    以主人翁的劳动态度迎接普选
    给国家创造更多的财富
    抚顺市内各区基层选举工作已经在八月底结束。市内各厂矿、机关、街道、学校等三百二十五个选区都分别召开了选举大会，共选出了五百九十一名区人民代表大会的代表。
    在这次选举中，很多劳动模范都被选为代表。露天矿区八十四名代表中，有四十九名是工人，其中有二十名劳动模范，如张子富、孔祥瑞、解有德、郑怀山等。露天矿剥离段胜利区当选的一百一十四名代表中，劳动模范就占了百分之三十。
    普选中，工人们用充沛的劳动热情，为国家创造更多的财富。抚顺市露天煤矿工人一开始就提出“签订好集体合同，迎接普选”；集体合同签订后，又用实际行动来保证实现这个合同。
    成千成万的工人都卷进生产竞赛热潮。采煤段提出了一百一十三个有关生产方面的重要问题，发动工人研究解决。“老白班”的工人抢先在五天内解决了一百零三件；二、三两班工人也并不落后，提前十八天完成了一个月的生产任务。露天矿北机电厂检修车间工人，采取了流水作业法，由每月检修机车十五台提高到二十二台；剥离段出勤率六月份为百分之九十二点三，七月份则提高到百分之九十五。
    劳动模范当选了代表
    抚顺国营机电厂机器车间召开选民小组会议。
    选民小组长在会上介绍了代表候选人张远增的简历，他说：“张远增从小就是个穷小子，十四岁到工厂里当学徒。抚顺解放后，张远增创造了生产新纪录，在一九五○年他用三小时完成了三天才能完成的生产任务。从一九五一年起，他领导一个生产小组，每月的生产效率都达到百分之一百一十以上。去年，他又以五个月的时间完成了小组全年增产节约计划的百分之一百一十六。张远增曾经连续三年被评为抚顺市的特等模范……”
    选民小组长的话没等说完，就被人打断了。一段划线组的工人佟长福说：“张远增不仅在生产上能带头，还非常关心工人的疾苦。有一天夜间工人尹承秀得了急性胃炎，生命很危险，需要输血急救。那天，正好是张远增值班，他毫不犹豫地给尹承秀输了自己的血，救活了他。”
    张远增终于当选了代表。
    “普选献礼台上”传喜讯
    在沈阳重型机器厂的“普选献礼台上”，每天可以看到工人给普选献礼的消息。老技术工人陈富文在领到选民证以后，和伙伴们说：“这是咱们三十多年来革命斗争的胜利果实啊！我们应该好好生产才对！”他克服了松劲的现象。他在做砂箱时，动脑筋，想办法改造工具，提高了生产效率，节约了一千多个工时。第四车间锻工小组的工人们劲头儿更大，他们用提前完成全年生产计划的成绩作为给普选的献礼。
    一个青年女镟工的决心
    田敏是中央铁道部机车车辆制造局工厂的青年女工。初进工厂的时候，她还是一个孩子，几年来，在党的培养教育下，逐渐提高了阶级觉悟，现在已经是一个光荣的青年团员了。在同志们的帮助下，技术也有了进步，最近已由学徒被提拔为正式镟工。普选中，她联想到目前她在生产上的缺点：由于操作上的不熟练，一种产品的废品率竟达到百分之四，生产量也不高。
    当她想到这件事的时候就感到很大的不安。“我应该怎样对待普选？”这个问题，就一直存在她的心里。在一次普选讨论会上，她向全组的同志们表示：“普选是让我们工人当家做主，要当家做主就得有当家做主的样子，我一定要提高生产。”
    田敏忠实地履行了自己的誓言，积极地向别人学习技术，苦心钻研。她做的一种产品，过去一天只能出四、五十个，现在已提高到七、八十个（最高时达到一百个）；废品率也减低了。
    给“镗镟组”工人送来了贺信
    有一天，沈阳空气压缩机厂里的二车间镗镟组工人正在生产的时候，一个床子忽然出了故障，眼看生产就要停下来了。全组的人，都想到这是给普选的献礼，决不让生产受到影响，当场一致决定同意把机件移到别的车床上去做。虽说任务是繁重的，但由于全组工人挖掘了潜在能力，胜利地完成了任务。
    一天晌午，镗镟组忽然热闹起来了。车间主任卢益谦，领着一批人抬着黑板，敲锣打鼓地向车间走来。镗镟组组长邵振海乐呵呵地把那黑板接过来，只见黑板上用红粉笔写着“贺信”两个大字，下边还写着祝词。车间的党支部、行政领导方面、青年团支部，也联名给镗镟组送来了贺信，祝贺全组同志在普选中提高了国家主人翁的思想，顺利地完成了生产任务。
