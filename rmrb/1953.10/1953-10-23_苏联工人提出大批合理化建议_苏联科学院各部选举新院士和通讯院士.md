Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 22nd: Moscow News: Staff members of various heavy industry sectors in the Soviet Union continue to propose a large number of innovation suggestions and inventions, achieving significant results in increasing production and practicing economy.

    In the petroleum industry, 24,000 innovation suggestions have been adopted in the Soviet Union this year, saving 90 million rubles annually. Oil workers in the famous Baku oil field alone have proposed more than 3,000 inventions and innovation suggestions this year. Some workers and experts at the Kirov Petroleum Trust have designed a special lifting frame, which not only can repair the underground equipment of a multi-layer oil well, but also can repair the underground equipment of two multi-layer oil wells. It is estimated that the application of these inventions can save more than 500,000 rubles annually.

    In the metallurgical industry, engineers, technicians, and workers from various enterprises have proposed thousands of rationalization suggestions this year. The various suggestions adopted by metallurgical innovators in Leningrad this year will save them more than 100 million rubles annually. F. Shamshin, a manipulator of the primary rolling mill at the "Red Selector" factory, improved the technology of rolling thin copper sheets. After the factory adopted his suggestion, it can save 30 tons of non-ferrous metals annually. In Moscow, the "Sickle and Hammer" Steel Factory has received more than 600 inventions and rationalization suggestions this year. By implementing only half of them, the factory saved funds worth 1.4 million rubles in the first nine months of this year. Staff members of the Aktyubinsk Ferroalloy Factory in the Kazakh Republic have invented a new method of casting refined ferromanganese, which increased labor productivity by 12 percent and can save 1.5 million rubles in one year.

    In the machine-building industry, the Leningrad Automatic Machine Forging Factory has extensively launched a movement of rationalization suggestions and inventions. In the past two years, the factory's staff members have designed and manufactured 12 types of automatic and semi-automatic machines, which have improved labor productivity and saved the factory several million rubles. Bionek, the director of the hollow rivet workshop in the factory, recently invented an automatic machine for manufacturing hollow rivets. This machine can complete nine operations that previously required nine machine tools. As a result, 100,000 rivets can be produced in each work shift, compared to only 70,000 previously.

    In automobile manufacturing, engineers, technicians, and workers at the Minsk Automobile Factory are working hard to improve the structure of automobile parts and components to reduce the amount of metal required to manufacture each vehicle. Due to the adoption of their suggestions, the average weight of each vehicle produced by the factory is 110 kilograms lighter than that of vehicles scheduled for continuous production. At the same time, the factory workers have also increased the load capacity of the vehicles. For example, an improved seven-ton dump truck can carry half a ton more cargo than before.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 22nd: According to TASS, Moscow: Departments of the Soviet Academy of Sciences began holding meetings on the 19th to elect new academicians and corresponding members of the Academy. This election is the largest in the history of the Academy, with a total of 53 new academicians and 144 new corresponding members to be elected. It will increase the number of academicians in the Academy by about 40 percent and the number of corresponding members by 50 percent. From October 22nd to 23rd, the Academy will hold a general assembly to vote on candidates for academicians and approve the corresponding members elected by the departments.

    One of the characteristics of this election is that the vast majority of candidates for academicians of the Academy are scientists trained in the Soviet era. Their work has been remarkably effective in the past fifteen to twenty years. Many candidates have been registered in the departments of radio engineering, electronics, automatic control and electrical mechanics, hydraulic engineering, and electrical engineering. Prominent scientists in physics, organic chemistry, general geology, geochemistry, and petroleum geology have been nominated as candidates for academicians of the Academy. The Department of Biological Sciences has proposed some experts as candidates, whose work is of great significance for the rapid development of various agricultural sectors and the production of sufficient daily necessities.

    At the meetings of the departments of the Academy of Sciences, many papers on the recent research achievements of Soviet scientists in various fields of knowledge will be read.

    【新华社二十二日讯】莫斯科消息：苏联各重工业部门的工作人员继续提出大批革新建议和发明，在增产节约方面获得了显著的成绩。
    在石油工业方面，苏联今年有二万四千项革新建议在石油工业中采用，每年可以节省九千万卢布。单是著名油田巴库的石油工人今年就提出了三千多项发明和革新建议。基洛夫石油托辣斯的一些工人和专家们，设计出了一种特殊的起重架，有了这种起重架，就不但可以修理一个多层油井的地下设备，而且可以修理两个多层油井的地下设备。据估计，应用这些发明每年可以节省五十多万卢布。
    在冶金工业方面，各企业的工程师、技术人员和工人今年提出了几千项合理化建议。列宁格勒的冶金革新者今年采用的各种建议，使他们每年可节省一亿多卢布。“红色选举者”工厂初轧机操使者弗·沙姆辛改进了轧薄铜片的技术。该厂采用他的建议后，每年可节省三十吨有色金属。在莫斯科，
    “镰刀与锤子”钢铁工厂今年已收到六百多项发明和合理化建议。仅实行其中的一半，该厂就在今年头九个月中节省了价值一百四十万卢布的资金。哈萨克共和国阿纠宾斯克铁合金工厂的工作人员发明了一种铸造精制锰铁的新方法，使劳动生产率提高了百分之十二，并可在一年中节省一百五十万卢布。
    在机器制造业方面，列宁格勒的自动机器模锻工厂广泛展开了合理化建议和发明的运动。最近两年中，该厂的工作人员设计并制造了十二种自动机器和半自动机器，提高了劳动生产率，使工厂节省了好几百万卢布。该厂空心铆钉车间主任比奥涅克最近发明了制造空心铆钉用的自动机器。这种机器可以完成以前要用九种机床进行的九种操作。结果，在每一工作班的时间内可以生产十万只铆钉，而从前只能生产七万只。
    在汽车制造方面，明斯克汽车工厂的工程师、技师和工人正在努力改进汽车零件和部件的结构，来减少制造每辆汽车所需的金属。由于采用了他们的建议，该厂出产的每辆汽车平均比预定连续生产的汽车重量减轻一百一十公斤。与此同时，该厂工人们还使汽车载重量提高了。例如，一辆改进了的七吨自卸卡车，可以比以前多装半吨货物。
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院各部在十九日开始举行会议，选举科学院的新院士和通讯院士。这次选举是科学院有史以来规模最大的一次选举，总计要选出五十三个新院士、一百四十四个新的通讯院士。它将使科学院院士的数目增加约百分之四十，通讯院士的数目增加百分之五十。从十月二十二日到二十三日，科学院将举行大会，表决院士候选人并通过各部所选出的通讯院士。
    这次选举的特点之一就是：科学院院士的候选人绝大多数是苏维埃时代培养出来的科学家。他们的工作在过去十五年到二十年中成效卓著。无线电工程、电子学、自动操纵与电气力学、水力工程和电气工程等部，都已登记了许多候选人。物理学、有机化学、普通地质学、地质化学和石油地质学方面的著名科学家，已被提名为科学院院士候选人。生物科学部已提出一些专家为候选人，这些专家的工作对于迅速发展农业各部门和生产充足的日用品具有重大的意义。
    在科学院各部的会议上，将宣读苏维埃科学家最近在各个知识领域中的研究成绩的许多篇论文。
