    Our Great Motherland
    The workers of the No. 3 Factory of the state-owned Shanghai Iron and Steel Company have created a one-time rolling method for small steel rails (originally requiring two rollings), saving a great deal of wealth for the country. These steel rails are being supplied in large quantities to forest railways and the needs of various factories, mines, and other construction projects. This is the newly produced steel rail. Workers are here inspecting the quality of the finished product.
