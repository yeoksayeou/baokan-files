Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch: The Vietnam News Agency reports that the Vietnam People's Army achieved great results in its counter-sweeping operations and frequent attacks in Nam Dinh Province in August and September. According to statistics, the People's Army killed or wounded more than 5,500 enemy troops during this period, including 4,861 enemy soldiers killed, including one Brigadier General, one Colonel, two Captains, and three Lieutenants; 708 enemy soldiers were wounded, including two Colonels, one of whom was the Chief of Staff of the French 3rd Division.

In the past two months, the Vietnam People's Army has persisted in fighting in Nam Dinh Province, successfully repelling several "sweeping operations" launched by the enemy, each involving an average of thirteen battalions. On August 1st, in the first battle in Du Xa, the People's Army killed or wounded 156 European and African mercenaries. Subsequently, in several counter-sweeping operations in Giao Thuy County and Hai Hau County, victories were also achieved, each time eliminating several enemy companies. In Hai Hau County alone, the People's Army eliminated a total of 1,187 enemy troops. In some battles in Nam Dinh Province, the People's Army severely damaged the puppet army's 701st, 703rd, and 706th light infantry battalions.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch: The Vietnam News Agency reports that a spokesperson for the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army recently issued a statement regarding the French army's airdropping of bandits in Lao Cai Province in northwestern Vietnam, saying: On October 3rd, the French colonialists dropped more than 50 airdropped bandits in the mountainous area between Sa Pa and Lao Cai. After landing, these bandits attempted to attack Coc Leu in Lao Cai Province, but were chased by local residents and fled west, leaving behind some corpses and weapons and ammunition.

In the three days up to October 6th, these bandits were continuously pursued and annihilated by the people's armed forces on the Coc Leu-Sa Pa highway, suffering many casualties. The remaining bandits fled into the jungle.

The statement said that the enemy has recently been boasting that they have destroyed the Coc Leu bridge, entered the provincial capital of Lao Cai, and stayed there for three hours, which is completely fabricated. The French colonialists' purpose in publicizing the airdropping of bandits in the Lao Cai area as an important battle is to cover up Naval's failures north of Luc Giang and in Nam Dinh Province.

    越南人民军两月来在南定省歼敌五千多名
    【新华社二十日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军八、九月份在南定省的反扫荡战和频繁的出击战中获得了巨大战果。据统计，人民军在这期间，一共毙伤敌军五千五百多名，其中打死敌军四千八百六十一名，内有一名准将、一名上校、两名上尉和三名中尉；打伤敌军七百零八名，其中有包括法军第三师参谋长在内的两名上校。
    在过去两个月中，越南人民军一直在南定省坚持作战，胜利地击退了敌人平均每次有十三营人参加的多次“扫荡战”。八月一日，人民军在杜社的第一次战斗中，杀伤了欧、非籍雇佣军一百五十六名。接着在交水县、海后县的多次反扫荡战中，又取得了胜利，每次都歼灭敌军几个连。仅在海后县，人民军一共歼灭敌军一千一百八十七名。在南定省的一些战斗中，人民军重创了伪军第七零一、七零三和七零六轻装营。
    【新华社二十日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总司令部发言人最近就法军在越南西北部老街省空降匪徒一事发表声明说：十月三日，法国殖民者在沙坝和老街间的山岭地带投下了五十多名空降匪徒。这些匪徒在降落以后，曾企图袭击老街省的谷柳，但受到当地居民的追击，向西逃窜，遗下一些死尸和武器弹药。
    在到十月六日为止的三天中，这些匪徒们在谷柳—沙坝公路上连接遭到人民武装的追歼，死伤很多。残匪逃到丛林里面。
    声明说，敌人最近大事吹嘘他们已破坏了谷柳桥、进入老街省会并在那里停留了三小时，这完全是虚构。法国殖民者把在老街地区空降匪徒一事大事宣传为一场重要战斗的目的，是想掩饰纳瓦尔在禄江以北和南定省所遭到的失败。
