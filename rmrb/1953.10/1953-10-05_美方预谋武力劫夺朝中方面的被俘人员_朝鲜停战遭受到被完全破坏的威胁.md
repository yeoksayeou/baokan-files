Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 4th: Our special correspondent reports: After the U.S. side directed special agents in the prisoner-of-war camps to continuously create riots and attack the Indian custodial troops, the Syngman Rhee gang immediately clamored and threatened to use force against the Indian troops. On the 2nd, a spokesman for the Syngman Rhee government, Gal Honggi, threatened to "take action soon" against the Indian troops; then, on the 3rd, the acting foreign minister of the Syngman Rhee government, Cao Zhenghuan, more explicitly stated that he would "take up arms to deal with" the Indian troops. At the same time, the Kuomintang remnant bandits huddled in Taiwan also issued a barrage of noise attacking India. This series of actions is clearly planned by the United States.

The U.S.'s intention in doing this is very clear. One of its purposes is to put pressure on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, attempting to make it deviate from its impartial stance. The other purpose is even more sinister, which is to seize by force the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war under the custody of the neutral nations.

Numerous facts have proven that the U.S. side has made various arrangements to implement the "riots and collective escapes" that U.S. news agencies have repeatedly mentioned. Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were repatriated after breaking through the control of special agents reported: Special agents posing as prisoners of war received maps of the Indian troop-guarded camps from the U.S. side before being handed over to the neutral nations. The maps showed the defensive situation of the Indian troops and the positions of the three divisions of the U.S. and Rhee armies south of the camp. U.S. officers openly told the prisoners of war that the U.S. military would meet the special agents in creating riots. In order to implement this plan, the U.S. side also prepared various weapons and communication equipment for the special agents to bring into the camp.

Now, ominous signals have appeared one after another. They show that the U.S. side, fearing that prisoners of war will request repatriation after receiving explanations, is stepping up preparations to implement its evil plan to armed seizure of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. This cannot but arouse people's high vigilance. If the U.S. side disregards everything and implements its conspiracy, the Korean armistice will be completely destroyed.

    美方预谋武力劫夺朝中方面的被俘人员
    朝鲜停战遭受到被完全破坏的威胁
    【新华社开城四日电】本社特派记者报道：美方指使战俘营内的特务分子连续制造暴乱并攻击印度看管部队之后，李承晚匪帮立即大肆咆哮，威胁要用武力对付印度部队。二日，李承晚政府的发言人葛弘基扬言要对印度部队“很快采取行动”；接着，李承晚政府的代理外务部长官曹正焕在三日更露骨地说要“拿起武器来对付”印度部队。与此同时，蜷缩在台湾的国民党残余匪帮也发出一片攻击印度的吵嚷。这一系列的行动显然都是美国有计划安排的。
    美国这样做的心计是很清楚的。它的一个目的是：对中立国遣返委员会行使压力，企图使它离开公正的立场。另一个目的更为险恶，这就是以武力劫夺在中立国看管下的朝中被俘人员。
    已有无数事实证明，美方进行了各种布置，准备实行美方通讯社已一再提及的“暴动和集体逃跑”。突破特务控制后遣返归来的朝中被俘人员曾报告：冒充战俘的特务分子，在移交给中立国以前，就从美方领得了印度部队看管营地的地图，地图上标示着印度部队设防情况以及营场南面的美李军三个师的阵地等，美国军官并曾公然对被俘人员们说，美军要接应特务分子制造暴动。为了实行这个计划，美方还准备了各种凶器以及通讯设备，使特务分子带进营场。
    现在，不祥的信号已接连出现了。它们显示：害怕战俘在接受解释后要求遣返的美方，正步步加紧地准备实行它的武装劫夺朝中被俘人员的罪恶计划。这不能不引起人们的高度警惕，如果美方竟不顾一切实行了它的阴谋，朝鲜停战就将被完全破坏。
