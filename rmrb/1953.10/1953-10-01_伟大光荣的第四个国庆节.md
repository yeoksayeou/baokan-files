    Great and Glorious Fourth National Day
    Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction
    The great and glorious fourth National Day of the People's Republic of China is approaching. The people of the whole country are extremely excited, and feel more excited year by year. Why? Because everyone clearly sees that their country is advancing with each passing day along the road led by Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party: In just four short years, unprecedented national unity has been achieved; various social reforms have been completed; especially this year, on the basis of the successful completion of economic recovery work, the first five-year plan has begun; the great victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea has declared the shameful failure of the imperialist policy of aggression and the unshakable international position of the People's Republic of China. The people of the whole country clearly see that an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous New China is steadily advancing towards the great socialist goal, and thus naturally increase their infinite love for the motherland. At the same time, everyone is deeply aware that the reason why our motherland was able to achieve revolutionary victory and has made such great and rapid progress since liberation is not due to anything else, but because we have taken the right path under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Before the establishment of New China, this path was the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism; after the establishment of New China, it is the struggle to gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization and to gradually realize the socialist transformation of the country's agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. Everyone is also aware that if you sincerely love the country, you can only and must follow the only correct road led by Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party and work for it; otherwise, you are not a patriot. This is the ideological manifestation of the general public during this period.
    In the past four years, private industrial and commercial enterprises have achieved great development due to the leadership and support of the state-owned economy. Naturally, from the perspective of the proportion of development, the state-owned economy has greatly surpassed private industry and commerce, which is reasonable and necessary. Without this, it would not be New Democracy, and it would not be possible to implement Article 26 of the Common Program, which stipulates: "To enable various social economic components to cooperate and divide labor under the leadership of the state-owned economy, each getting its due." On the contrary, only in this way, with the rise of the state-owned economy and the consolidation of its leading role, can our national industry and commerce get what is "due". What is "due"? It is the "due" within the New Democratic orbit, not the "due" of the old capitalism. We all clearly recognize that the "due" of the old capitalism is a "dead end"! The benevolent and wise Chairman Mao is leading industrialists and businessmen out of the "dead end" and onto the road to life.
    During the "Five-Anti" movement and for a period of time thereafter, the ideological emotions of industrialists and businessmen were somewhat turbulent. But recently, they have seen the problem very clearly, and any concerns and erroneous ideas have gradually been dispelled. During the transition period, the state's policy toward private industry and commerce is to gradually realize socialist transformation and correctly exert its role. Chairman Mao recently clearly instructed us: "To promote the cooperativization of agriculture and handicrafts in a planned way, and to carry out the transformation of private industry and commerce, and to correctly exert the role of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. All of these are to ensure the steady growth of the proportion of socialist components in the national economy."
    Industrialists and businessmen understand that, first of all, the state affirms the role of private industry and commerce. After affirming the role, it also provides leadership to strictly limit the development of private capitalism that is unfavorable to the country and the people, and to give full play to the aspects that are beneficial to the country and the people. What are the beneficial aspects? Working hard to produce and supply daily necessities for the broad masses of the people, paying taxes honestly and legally, and accumulating funds for the country, while industrialists and businessmen themselves also "benefit from it." Isn't this good! This is precisely the achievement of the benevolent and wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. Industrialists and businessmen can only be good at expanding the role that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and eliminate the role that is detrimental to the country and the people, and this is beneficial to both the public and the private. Chairman Mao called some bourgeois elements with national ideas "national bourgeoisie". If they are called national bourgeois elements, shouldn't they give full play to "national love"!
    Industrialists and businessmen must also understand that to play these good roles, it is not possible without transformation, but it is not impossible to transform. "Shoddy workmanship and cutting corners" has become a common practice in the business community in the past. Some people say that "habits become second nature" and that "it is easier to move mountains than to change one's nature." I strongly disagree. "Habits" are not impossible to change. If people truly love the country and the people, they will of course see clearly that "shoddy workmanship and cutting corners" are letting the country down and letting the people down, and must never be done. Taking a big step back, if people are really good at planning for their own interests, they should also see clearly that these behaviors not only cause personal credibility to be completely lost, but also cannot escape the severe sanctions of national laws, and end up in disgrace and ruin. Is it worth it? These things, as long as you explain the pros and cons to them clearly, if they are not fools or idiots, they will definitely understand. They read the newspapers every day and see many good and bad examples. They study every day, understand some principles, friends help them, and groups educate them. Gradually, they change their old bad ideas and create new good ideas. This is "ideological transformation." The "Five-Anti" movement was a cleansing based on facts, and its role was still education. Chairman Mao declared: "Lenient in the past, strict in the future."
    Someone also asked about the future of private industry and commerce. What will happen to private industry and commerce in a socialist society? I replied: You have to study it first! If you keep studying and your thinking changes to a certain stage, I believe that your question will also change to another form, and perhaps further advance to a higher stage, and you yourself will think that this question is unnecessary. If you must ask today, then I can also answer: Under the current policy of public-private partnership, private industry and commerce only need to accept the leadership of the state-owned economy and actively operate in a direction that is beneficial to the country and the people. Everyone will still have work to do and benefits to gain. Will there be a problem at that time? Doesn't Chapter 12 of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) explain the socialist principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work"? We must also remember what was said above that Chairman Mao instructed that the proportion of socialist components in the national economy is "steadily growing", so what the future holds for industrialists and businessmen depends on what role they play today.
    This is the fourth National Day, and some people have different ideological manifestations. I believe that generally, thinking is progressing with each annual National Day.

    伟大光荣的第四个国庆节
    中国民主建国会总会主任委员  黄炎培
    伟大、光荣的中华人民共和国第四个国庆节到临了。全国人民心里不知道有多么兴奋，而且感到一年比一年兴奋。为什么呢？因为大家看清楚自己的国家依照着毛主席和中国共产党所领导的道路在日新月异地前进：短短四年中间达到了空前的全国人民的统一；完成了各种社会改革；尤其是今年在胜利完成经济恢复工作的基础上，开始了第一个五年计划建设；抗美援朝斗争的伟大胜利，宣布了帝国主义侵略政策的可耻失败和中华人民共和国国际地位的不可动摇，全国人民看清楚了一个独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国在不断地向着伟大的社会主义目标稳步前进，因而很自然地对祖国增进了无限的热爱。同时大家深深地觉悟了，觉悟到：我们祖国之所以能够取得革命胜利，解放之后所以有这么大和这么快的进步，不是由于别的，而是由于在毛主席领导之下把路子走对了。这条路在新中国建立以前，是反对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的斗争，在新中国建立以后，是为逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步实现国家对农业、手工业、和私营工商业的社会主义改造的斗争。大家还觉悟到：如果真心爱国，只有也必须走毛主席和中国共产党所领导的这样唯一正确的大道，而为之努力，否则就不是爱国者，这是一般人在这一时期的思想表现。
    私营工商业在这四年中间，由于国营经济的领导和扶助，获得了很大的发展。自然，从发展的比重看来，国营经济大大地超过了私营工商业，这是合理的、必要的。不这样便不是新民主主义，便没有实行共同纲领第二十六条规定：“使各种社会经济成分在国营经济领导之下，分工合作，各得其所”。相反的，只有这样，国营经济高涨了，它的领导作用巩固了，才能使我国民族工商业得“所”。得什么“所”？是新民主主义轨道内的“所”，而不是旧资本主义的“所”。我们大家认识清楚了，旧资本主义的“所”，是“死所”啦！仁慈而英明的毛主席，就是带领工商业者们出“死所”，走生路。
    “五反”运动起来以及其后一段时间中，工商业者们的思想情绪是有些动荡不安的。但到最近把问题看得一清二楚了，任何顾虑和错误的念头渐渐地打消了。国家在过渡时期内，对私营工商业的政策，是要逐步实现社会主义的改造，并正确地发挥其作用。毛主席最近很明确地指示我们了：“有步骤地促进农业和手工业合作化，和进行对私营工商业的改造，并正确地发挥个体农业、手工业和私营工商业的作用。所有这些，都是为了保证国民经济中社会主义成份的比重的稳步增长。”
    工商业者们了解了，首先看到国家是肯定私营工商业的作用的。肯定了作用，还加以领导，使对私人资本主义不利于国家和人民的发展，加以严格的限制，而于国家和人民有利方面，使它充分发挥。什么是有利方面呢？努力生产，为广大人民供应日常用品，规规矩矩地依法纳税，为国家积累资金，而工商业者自己亦“与有利焉”。这还不好么！这正是毛主席和中国共产党仁慈和英明的领导的成就。工商业者们只有善于展开有利于国计民生的作用，消灭不利于国家不利于人民的作用，这才是公私两利。毛主席对某些资产阶级有民族思想的，称为“民族资产阶级”，难道被称为民族资产阶级分子，自己倒不好好地发挥“民族爱”么！
    工商业者们还须懂得要起这些好的作用，并非不经改造就可能的，但也不是不可能改造的。“粗制滥造、偷工减料”，在过去成为工商界的惯习。有人说“相习成性”，说“江山易改，本性难移”。我很不以为然。“习”不是不可以改的。如果人们真是爱国家，爱人民的，当然会看清楚，“粗制滥造、偷工减料”这些都对不起国家，对不起人民，是万万做不得的。就退一大步来说，如果人们真正善于替自己打算利益的，也应该看清楚这些行为，既使个人信誉丧失净尽，还逃不了国家法律的严厉制裁，身败名裂，值得么？这些，只要把利害向他们说清楚，如果不是傻子，不是呆汉，一定自己会明白的。天天看报，看到了许多好的坏的例子。天天学习，懂得一些道理，朋友在帮助他们，团体在教育他们，渐渐地改去了旧的坏的思想，造成了新的好的思想，这就是“思想改造”。“五反”运动，是根据事实，进行了一次清洗，作用还是教育，毛主席宣示：“过去从宽、今后从严。”
    又有人问到私营工商业前途问题。到了社会主义社会里，私营工商业怎样？我答复了：你得先去学习一下！如果不断地学习，思想改变到某一阶段，我相信你这发问，也会改变成另一方式，也许再进一步到了更高阶段，你自己会认为这问题无成立的必要了。如果今天定要发问，那我也可以答复：私营工商业在今天公私兼顾的政策下，只须自己接受国营经济领导，向着有利于国家，有利于人民方面，积极地经营起来，大家都还有工作可做，有利益可得，难道到那时候会成问题么？联共
  （布）党史第十二章不是说明“各尽所能、按劳取酬”的社会主义原则么？我们还得记着上文说过毛主席指示国民经济中社会主义成份的比重，是“稳步增长”的，所以工商业者们将来的前途如何，就要看他们今天的作用如何。
    这是第四个国庆节，某些人又一种的思想表现，我相信一般地思想都在随着一年一度的国庆节而进步。
