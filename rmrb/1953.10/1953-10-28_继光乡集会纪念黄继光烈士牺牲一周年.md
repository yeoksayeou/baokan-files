    Jiguang Township Gathering Commemorates the First Anniversary of Martyr Huang Jiguang's Sacrifice
    Representatives from various villages in Jiguang Township, Zhongjiang County, Sichuan Province, gathered on the 19th to commemorate the first anniversary of the glorious sacrifice of Huang Jiguang, a special-class hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers. At the meeting, Gu Pingjun, secretary of the Jiguang Township Branch of the Communist Party of China and a close friend of Huang Jiguang during his lifetime, spoke first. He said: In the past year, under the inspiration of Martyr Huang Jiguang's great patriotism and internationalism, we have united and helped each other, overcome various natural disasters, and solved the production and living difficulties of impoverished revolutionary martyrs' families and revolutionary military families. The township's rice production has generally increased by 12%, exceeding the original plan. During the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, the township repaired 91 weirs and ponds, implementing simultaneous threshing and plowing, and successfully completed the autumn plowing work. In the future, we should continue to work hard to increase grain production and maintain the glorious title of Jiguang Township. Next, the hero's mother, Deng Fangzhi, said at the meeting: To commemorate the first anniversary of Jiguang's sacrifice, we must actively participate in national construction and support the Volunteers with greater strength.
    Finally, the representatives present had a heated discussion and formulated the township's plan for increasing production and practicing economy. The plan includes vigorously mobilizing the masses to adopt advanced techniques such as deep plowing, doing a good job in the winter planting; actively selling surplus grain and cotton, and buying back oil cakes and farm tools to expand production; at the same time, doing a good job in accumulating fertilizer and storing water, and striving to increase wheat production by 10%, rapeseed production by 7%, and other miscellaneous grain production by 5%. The plan ensures no extravagance or waste, and proper storage of grain to prevent it from being scattered or getting damp. The township also guarantees to hand in grain to the state on time and strive to be a model township for grain delivery.

    继光乡集会纪念黄继光烈士牺牲一周年
    四川省中江县继光乡各村代表，于十九日集会纪念中国人民志愿军特级英雄黄继光烈士光荣牺牲一周年。会上首先由黄继光烈士生前好友、中国共产党继光乡支部书记顾平均讲话。他说：一年来，我们在黄继光烈士伟大的爱国主义和国际主义精神感召下，团结互助，战胜了各种自然灾害，解决了贫苦革命烈士家属、革命军人家属生产和生活上的困难，使全乡水稻普遍增产百分之十二，超额完成了原订计划。秋收秋耕中，全乡修补了九十一座堰塘，实行边打边犁，顺利完成了秋耕工作。今后，我们应继续努力增产粮食，保持继光乡的光荣称号。接着，英雄的母亲邓芳芝在会上说：为了纪念继光牺牲一周年，我们要积极参加祖国建设，用更大的力量支持志愿军。
    最后，到会代表们进行了热烈的讨论，订出全乡的增产节约计划。计划的内容是要大力发动群众接受深耕等先进经验，做好小春；踊跃出售余粮和棉花，买回油饼和农具以扩大生产；同时，做好积肥、蓄水工作，争取小麦增产一成，油菜增产百分之七，其他杂粮增产百分之五。计划中保证不铺张浪费，并保管好粮食，不使粮食抛撒和受潮。全乡还保证按期缴纳好粮给国家，争取作交粮模范乡。
