To all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
    Today, the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the people of the whole country warmly celebrate the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    In the past year, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, our people have achieved new victories and achievements in all aspects.
    Our people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea has achieved a great victory. The Korean armistice has been realized, which is a great victory for the entire peace and democracy camp. In the future, our task is to continue to strive for the early convening of the political conference and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.
    Our people and the Korean people have forged an unbreakable friendship and unity in the struggle against U.S. aggression. This friendship and unity guarantees the victory of our common cause.
    The great friendship between our people and the Soviet people has been further consolidated and developed. Facts have proven, and will continue to prove, that the unbreakable friendly alliance between China and the Soviet Union is the most powerful guarantee for defending peace in the Far East and the world.
    The friendship between our people and the people of all people's democratic countries has also been further consolidated and developed.
    The friendship between all peace-loving people and our people around the world is also developing day by day.
    All this proves that we are not isolated internationally.
    Domestically, after successfully completing the national economic recovery phase, our people have entered a new period of planned construction this year. Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, our people are united as one, full of confidence, and steadily advancing towards the great goal of socialist industrialization. Now the people of the whole country are enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's call, actively carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, striving to complete and overfulfill the 1953 national plan, and preparing favorable conditions for the 1954 national plan.
    The Soviet government has decided to provide long-term, comprehensive, and massive assistance to our economic construction. This assistance is an important condition for ensuring the success of our economic construction.
    In order to cooperate with the country's economic construction, our country has begun this year to conduct elections for people's congresses at all levels in order to further unite the people of the whole country, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and enhance the strength of national construction.
    Along with the rapid development of our national economic construction, the modernization of our national defense has also achieved significant results, and the power of the People's Liberation Army is constantly increasing.
    The current situation is: Although the Korean War has stopped, U.S. imperialism is still occupying our territory Taiwan and actively assisting the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits in disrupting and threatening the safety of our coast; the U.S. government is still planning to keep the Korean armistice in an unstable state and is conspiring with the Syngman Rhee clique to undermine the political conference; in addition, U.S. imperialism in the Far East and Europe is still attempting to continue to implement the policy of expanding armaments, preparing for war, and provocation, keeping the international situation tense. All this shows that the aggressive forces headed by the United States are still opposed to easing international tensions and obstructing international peace negotiations.
    Therefore, I order you: Maintain a high degree of vigilance at all times, strengthen military preparedness, strive to learn advanced Soviet military science and technology, study politics and culture, exercise your bodies, master new combat techniques, strengthen organization and discipline, and carry forward the fine traditions of heroism, resourcefulness, and hard work, and strive to consolidate national defense and defend the security of the motherland!
    Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!
    Commander-in-Chief Zhu De

    中国人民解放军总部命令
    一九五三年十月一日于北京中国人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员同志们！
    今天，中国人民解放军和全国人民一起，热烈地庆祝中华人民共和国成立的四周年。
    在过去一年中，我国人民在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，在各方面取得了新的胜利和成就。
    我国人民的抗美援朝斗争已获得了伟大的胜利，朝鲜停战已经实现，这是整个和平民主阵营的伟大胜利。今后我们的任务，就是继续为争取政治会议的迅速召开和朝鲜问题的和平解决而奋斗。
    我国人民和朝鲜人民在反对美国侵略的斗争中，已结成了牢不可破的友谊和团结，这种友谊和团结保证了我们共同事业的胜利。
    我国人民和苏联人民的伟大友谊已更加巩固与发展。事实已经证明，今后将继续证明，中国与苏联的牢不可破的友好同盟是保卫远东及世界和平的最有力的保证。
    我国人民和各人民民主国家的人民之间的友谊，亦已有了进一步的巩固与发展。
    在世界范围内，一切爱好和平的人民和我国人民之间的友谊，亦正在一天一天地发展着。
    这一切都证明，在国际上我们不是孤立的。
    在国内，我国人民在胜利地结束了国家经济的恢复阶段以后，从今年起，已进入了有计划建设的新时期。我国人民正在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导下，团结一致，满怀信心地稳步地向着社会主义工业化的伟大目标前进。现在全国人民正在热烈响应毛主席的号召，积极开展增产节约的运动，为完成和超额完成一九五三年的国家计划而奋斗，并为一九五四年的国家计划准备有利的条件。
    苏联政府已决定给我国经济建设以长期的、全面的、巨大的援助，这种援助是保证我国经济建设成功的重要条件。
    为了配合国家的经济建设，我国在今年已开始进行各级人民代表大会的选举，以进一步团结全国人民，巩固人民民主专政，增强国家建设的力量。
    与我们国家经济建设的迅速发展同时，我国国防的现代化建设也已获得重大的成绩，人民解放军的威力正在不断地增强。
    目前的情况是：朝鲜战争虽然已经停止，但美帝国主义仍然侵占着我国领土台湾，并积极协助蒋介石残余匪帮扰乱和威胁我国沿海的安全；美国政府仍在有计划地使朝鲜停战处于不稳定的状态，并与李承晚集团共同进行着破坏政治会议的预谋；此外，美帝国主义在远东和欧洲仍在企图继续执行扩军备战和挑衅的政策，使国际形势保持紧张状态。这一切都说明：以美国为首的侵略势力仍然反对缓和国际紧张局势，阻挠国际和平协商。
    因此，我命令你们：时刻保持高度警惕，加强军事戒备，努力学习苏联先进军事科学和技术，学习政治和文化，锻炼体质，掌握新的战斗技术，加强组织性和纪律性，发扬英勇、机智、艰苦朴素的优良作风，为巩固国防、保卫祖国的安全而奋斗！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    总司令　朱德
