    Today we are signing a new Sino-Japanese trade agreement. Since the signing of the first Sino-Japanese trade agreement in June 1952, Sino-Japanese trade originally had the potential for rapid development. However, due to the U.S. government's interference and obstruction, and the Japanese government's subservience to the U.S.'s "embargo" policy, the actual implementation of the first Sino-Japanese trade agreement to date cannot be considered satisfactory. Nevertheless, we, the Chinese people, have always welcomed the restoration and development of commercial and trade relations with all foreign governments and peoples on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Therefore, we are still willing to sign a new Sino-Japanese trade agreement with the Japanese people to continue our efforts to develop Sino-Japanese trade.
    Trade between the peoples of China and Japan has broad prospects. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, China's industrial and agricultural production has recovered and is developing forward. Therefore, China's international trade relations are not shrinking but expanding. The increasing development of China's foreign trade volume over the past three or four years, the establishment of close economic and mutual assistance relations not only with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, but also the establishment of trade relations with industrial and commercial circles in India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Finland, France, Britain, etc., is sufficient to fully illustrate this point.
    The main obstacle currently hindering the development of Sino-Japanese trade is the U.S.'s "Battle Act" and "embargo" measures. The U.S. government is obstructing trade between Japan and other countries with China. The result is not that China is harmed, but rather the countries that implement the U.S.'s illegal "embargo" policy and accept the restrictions of the "Battle Act," because these countries have lost good opportunities to expand international trade and are also suffering from the U.S.'s increasingly intensified economic monopoly, leading to trade decline and increasingly profound economic difficulties. After the Korean armistice, although the U.S. government has lost its last excuse, it still continues to implement "embargo" measures stubbornly and unreasonably, interferes barbarously in the trade policies of various countries, and disregards the economic difficulties caused by the "embargo" in various countries. The U.S. government's barbaric and unreasonable "embargo" policy has seriously damaged the economic independence and economic development of various countries, and has been subjected to increasingly widespread opposition from the peoples of various countries, and will inevitably suffer final bankruptcy and failure.
    This time, thanks to the joint efforts of our side and the representatives of the "Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade" of Japan, a new trade agreement has been signed. The signing of the new trade agreement is only the beginning of further efforts to develop Sino-Japanese trade. It would be wrong to assume that the agreement will be realized naturally just because it has been signed. Because the United States will never relax its conspiracy to interfere with and obstruct the development of Sino-Japanese trade. To realize the new Sino-Japanese trade agreement, greater efforts must be made. We believe that only when the Japanese people and those who are enthusiastic about Sino-Japanese trade strive to break away from the U.S.'s "embargo" policy and realize an independent and autonomous economic policy for Japan can Sino-Japanese trade be developed on a larger scale, and the new Sino-Japanese trade agreement be well implemented.
    I remember that before the delegation came to China, the Japanese "Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade" sent a telegram expressing its agreement to the visit of the delegation of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to Japan and its willingness to work to promote its realization. Now, as the delegation of the Japanese "Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade" is about to return home after visiting China for nearly a month and successfully signing a new trade agreement, it is hoped that you gentlemen can promptly facilitate the realization of the visit of the delegation of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to Japan after returning home.
    Finally, I would like to wish further success to the efforts of the peoples of China and Japan to develop the friendship and trade relations between the two peoples, and to enable the new Sino-Japanese trade agreement to be fully realized.

    在新的中日贸易协议签字仪式上
    南汉宸的谈话
    今天我们签订新的中日贸易协议。自从一九五二年六月签订第一次中日贸易协议以来，中日贸易原有迅速发展的可能，但由于美国政府的横加阻挠和干涉，和日本政府的屈从美国的“禁运”政策，到目前为止，第一次中日贸易协议的实际执行状况，是不能认为满意的。不过，我们中国人民，一向欢迎在平等和互利的基础上，与各外国政府和人民恢复和发展通商贸易关系。因此，我们仍然愿意与日本人民签订新的中日贸易协议，为继续发展中日贸易而努力。
    中日两国人民之间的贸易，是有广阔的前途的。中华人民共和国成立以来，中国工业、农业的生产业已恢复，并正在向前发展。因此，中国的国际贸易关系不但不是日益缩小，而是日益扩大。中国过去三、四年来，对外贸易总额的日益发展，不仅与苏联和人民民主国家建立了密切的经济互助关系，而且也与印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰、芬兰，并和法国、英国等的工商界建立了贸易关系，就足以充分说明这一点。
    当前妨碍中日贸易的开展的主要障碍，就是美国的“巴特尔法案”和“禁运”措施。美国政府阻挠日本和其他国家对中国的贸易。结果受害的并不是中国，倒是奉行美国的非法“禁运”政策和接受“巴特尔法案”限制的国家，因为这些国家失去了扩大国际贸易的良好机会，并还受美国的日益加厉的经济垄断，使贸易衰退，经济上发生日益深刻的困难。朝鲜停战以后，美国政府虽然已失去其最后的藉口，但是仍然横蛮无理地继续执行“禁运”措施，横暴地干涉各国贸易政策，置各国因“禁运”而造成的经济困难于不顾。美国政府这种横蛮无理的“禁运”政策，由于其严重地损害了各国的经济独立和经济发展，已经遭受各国人民越来越普遍的反对，而且必将遭受最后的破产与失败。
    此次由于我方和日本“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”代表团各位先生的共同努力，签订了新的贸易协议。新的贸易协议的签订，仅仅是为发展中日贸易而作的进一步努力的开始。如果认为协议签订了，就会自然而然地实现，那是不对的。因为美国决不会放松干涉与阻挠中日贸易开展的阴谋。为了新的中日贸易协议的实现，必须作更大的努力。我们认为只有日本人民和热心于中日贸易的人士，努力摆脱美国的“禁运”政策，实现日本独立自主的经济政策，中日贸易才能更大规模地开展起来，新的中日贸易协议也才能很好地实行。
    我记得，在代表团诸位先生来中国之前，日本“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”曾来电表示同意中国人民政治协商会议代表团访问日本，并愿为促其实现而努力。现在，在日本“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”代表团访问中国将近一个月之久并成功地签订了新的贸易协议和即将回国之际，希望诸位先生回国后能迅速促成中国人民政治协商会议代表团访日的实现。
    最后，谨祝中日两国人民为发展中日两国人民之间的友谊和贸易关系的努力，获得进一步的成功，并使新的中日贸易协议得以完满实现。
