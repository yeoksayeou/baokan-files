    Li Jiafa, a Hero in the Style of Huang Jiguang
         Ji Yun
    On the rainy night of July 13th, on the fire-swept Jiaoyan Mountain peak, north of the Jincheng River and west of the North Han River on the Jincheng front, nineteen-year-old Youth League member Li Jiafa, in a heroic act like that of Huang Jiguang, used his chest to block the enemy’s machine gun, which was fiercely firing at our assault troops, enabling the assault troops to advance smoothly and plant the red flag on the main peak of Jiaoyan Mountain.
    Li Jiafa was from Nanling County, Anhui Province. He joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in June 1951 and was assigned to the sixth squad of the first company of a certain unit as a soldier. He was an active and enthusiastic young man, who loved to talk and play, and always took the lead in his work. Li Jiafa made rapid progress and gloriously joined the Chinese New Democratic Youth League in October 1952.
    The brilliant image of the People's Hero inspired Li Jiafa to move forward. He loved to read comic books such as "Steel Soldier" and "Dadu River." The deeds of the immortal hero Huang Jiguang moved him even more deeply. He told his comrades that if he encountered a situation like Huang Jiguang in annihilating the enemy, he would definitely perform a heroic act like Huang Jiguang. He also hoped to perform more meritorious services for the people and go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao.
    July 13th, the day Li Jiafa had been looking forward to for a long time, arrived. His unit was ordered to launch a counterattack on the steep Jiaoyan Mountain. On this day, he put on his full gear and entered the ambush position with his comrades, waiting for the order to charge. At this time, it was raining lightly, and Li Jiafa and the soldier Gong Dexiu, who was lying next to him, talked in low voices. They talked about their plans to perform meritorious service before the battle, and studied the situations they might encounter in the battle. They felt that they had a very important responsibility to the people of the motherland and the Korean people. Li Jiafa then took out the "family portrait" photo and said, "This time, I will definitely send a commendation to my family!"
    The task of Li Jiafa's second platoon was to break through the southern foot of Jiaoyan Mountain and then plant the red flag on the main peak of Jiaoyan Mountain along the southern foot.
    The southern foot was the strongest part of the enemy's Jiaoyan Mountain defense position, heavily guarded and supported by strong fortifications. At nine o'clock in the evening, countless cannons of our army roared in unison, turning Jiaoyan Mountain into a sea of ​​fire. The charge began, and Li Jiafa rushed to the front, excitedly shouting, "Our artillery is firing so well! The opportunity to perform meritorious service for the people has come, follow our artillery and charge!" The soldiers braved the rain and charged towards the enemy in the mud.
    Suddenly, a rain of bullets fell in front of the charging warriors. This was fired from the enemy's largest bunker on the mountainside. The gun holes of the bunker were facing the sides of the two mountain ridges on the left and right and a large ditch in the middle, blocking the warriors' path. The assault troops were blocked. Li Jiafa lay in the mud, seeing the enemy's machine gun bullets sweeping in front of him. It would be difficult to rush past without blowing up this machine gun. He bravely took on the task of blowing up the enemy's bunker. He touched the two grenades he was carrying, got up from the ground, bent over and rushed straight to the large bunker. Suddenly, a string of bullets shot from the front and injured his left foot. It turned out that there was a small bunker in front of the large bunker. Without first destroying this small bunker, it would not be possible to approach the large bunker. Li Jiafa, wounded, climbed step by step from the right side of the small bunker, threw a grenade into the bunker opening, and blew up the enemy in the bunker. Then, he continued to climb towards the large bunker that was firing madly.
    The soldiers lay on the ground, blocked by the enemy's firepower, watching Li Jiafa's movements nervously, waiting for his explosion to succeed.
    The enemy's flares hung in the pouring rain, illuminating the mountain ridge brightly. Everyone watched as Li Jiafa dragged his injured foot, calmly and quickly climbing towards the large bunker that was spewing fire. He approached the large bunker, raised his right hand, and threw the last grenade into the firing hole. With a loud noise, the enemy's machine gun stopped firing. The soldiers immediately jumped out of the mud, shouting and rushing forward. Suddenly, the machine gun in the large bunker started firing again, and the dense bullets shot into the mud in front, splashing the mud. Under the order to "stop advancing," the soldiers lay down again. Li Jiafa had used up all his ammunition, and the situation was extremely critical. The instructor immediately ordered another soldier to "continue the blast." At this moment, the large bunker suddenly became silent. It turned out that the immortal warrior, the glorious Youth League member Li Jiafa, had thrown himself onto the enemy's firing hole with his chest, blocking the bullets fired frantically by the enemy. After Li Jiafa's sacrifice, his hands were still tightly grasping the soil on the bunker, and his half-open eyes were watching the huge rocks on the main peak of Jiaoyan Mountain.
    The soldiers shouted angrily to avenge Li Jiafa, rushed to the enemy's position, annihilated the enemy inside the large bunker, and rushed to the main peak of Jiaoyan Mountain. At dawn, the large red flag that Li Jiafa had embroidered on before his death was planted on the top of Jiaoyan Mountain. The troops that had been inserted into the enemy's depth from both sides of Jiaoyan Mountain had also driven the enemy south of the Jincheng River. Like the immortal hero Huang Jiguang, the name of martyr Li Jiafa will forever live in people's hearts, inspiring people to love peace more and fight more bravely to defend peace. Peace is what the martyrs won for us with their blood and lives. (Xinhua News Agency)

    黄继光式的英雄李家发
         纪云
    七月十三日的雨夜里，在金城川以北、北汉江以西金城前线战火弥漫的轿岩山高峰上，十九岁的青年团员李家发以黄继光式的英雄行为，用自己的胸膛堵住了正在向我突击部队猛烈发射的敌人的一挺机关枪口，使突击部队顺利前进，把红旗插上了轿岩山的主峰。
    李家发是安徽省南陵县人，一九五一年六月参加中国人民志愿军，被分配在某部第一连第六班当战士。他是个积极热情的小伙子，平时爱说、爱玩，工作抢在头里做。李家发进步很快，一九五二年十月光荣地参加了中国新民主主义青年团。
    人民英雄的光辉形象鼓舞着李家发前进。他最爱看“钢铁战士”、“大渡河”等连环画。不朽的英雄黄继光的事迹更深深地感动了他。他向战友们表示：如果遇到像黄继光在歼灭敌人中那样的情况，他一定也要做出像黄继光那样的英雄行为。他还想望着为人民多立功劳，到北京去看毛主席。
    七月十三日，李家发盼望很久的一天来到了。他所在的部队奉命向险峻的轿岩山发起反击。这天，他着上全副武装，和战友们进入了潜伏位置，等待着冲锋的号令。这时，细雨密密地下着，李家发和跟他伏在一起的战士巩德修小声地谈起话来。他们谈起了战前的立功计划，研究着战斗中可能遇到的情况，他们觉得自己对祖国人民和朝鲜人民负着非常重大的责任。李家发这时掏出了家里的“全家福”照片说：“这次，我一定把立功喜报寄回家去！”
    李家发所在的第二排的任务，是突破轿岩山的南山脚，然后顺着南山脚把红旗插上轿岩山主峰。
    南山脚是敌人轿岩山防御阵地中最强的地方，有重兵据守，并有强固的工事作依托。晚上九点钟，我军无数门大炮一齐轰鸣，把轿岩山打成一片火海。冲锋开始了，李家发冲在最前面，他兴奋地高声大喊：“咱们的炮火打得多好！为人民立功的机会到了，跟着咱们的炮火冲啊！”战士们冒着雨在泥泞中向敌人冲去。
    突然，一阵狂风骤雨般的子弹落到了正在冲锋的勇士们跟前。这是从山腰上敌人一个最大的碉堡里发射出来的，碉堡的枪眼正对着左右两条山梁的两侧和中间的一条大沟，阻碍着勇士们的冲锋道路。冲锋部队被挡住了。李家发伏在泥泞里，看见敌人的机枪子弹在前面扫射着。不炸掉这挺机枪，要想冲过去是很困难的。他勇敢地担负了爆破敌人碉堡的任务。他摸了摸自己身上带着的两颗炸药手榴弹，从地上爬起来躬着腰就直向大碉堡冲去。突然前面射来一串子弹把他的左脚打伤了。原来在大碉堡前还有一个小地堡。不先炸毁这个小地堡，就不能接近大碉堡。李家发带着伤从小地堡的右侧一步步地爬去，顺着碉堡口投进去一颗炸药手榴弹，把碉堡里的敌人炸掉了。接着，他继续向正在疯狂地射击着的大碉堡爬去。
    战士们伏在被敌人火力封锁着的地上，紧张地注视着李家发的动作，等待他爆炸成功。
    敌人的照明弹悬在滂沱大雨的空中，把山岭照得通亮。大家眼看李家发拖着一只受伤的脚，沉着地向喷射着火蛇的大碉堡迅速爬去。他靠近了大碉堡，扬起右手，把最后的一颗炸药手榴弹投进了射口。随着一声巨响，敌人的机枪停止了射击。战士们立刻从泥泞里跳出来，喊着杀声向前猛冲。突然，大碉堡里的机枪又重新开始射击，密集的子弹射在前面的泥水里，泥浆溅飞起来。在“停止前进”的命令下，战士们又重新卧倒了。李家发的全部弹药已经用完了，情况是异常危急的。指导员立即命令另一个战士“继续爆破”。这时，大碉堡突然寂静下来。原来，不朽的战士，光荣的青年团员李家发已用自己的胸膛猛扑到敌人的射口上，挡住了敌人疯狂射出来的子弹。李家发牺牲以后，双手仍紧紧地抓着碉堡上的泥土，半睁着的眼睛注视着轿岩山主峰上的巨石。
    战士们忿怒地叫着为李家发复仇的口号，猛冲上敌人的阵地，歼灭了大碉堡里面的敌人，冲向轿岩山的主峰。黎明，李家发生前曾经在上面绣过字的大红旗被插上了轿岩山的峰顶。从轿岩山两侧插向敌人纵深的部队，也已经把敌人赶到了金城川以南。和不朽的英雄黄继光一样，李家发烈士的名字将永远活在人们的心里，鼓舞着人们更加热爱和平，更加勇敢地为保卫和平而斗争。和平，是先烈们用鲜血和生命为我们争得的。（新华社）
