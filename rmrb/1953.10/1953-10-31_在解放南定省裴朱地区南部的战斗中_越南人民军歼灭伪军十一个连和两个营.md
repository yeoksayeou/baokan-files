    Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army announced on the 28th that after annihilating eleven puppet army light infantry companies and two battalions, the Vietnamese People's Army liberated the southern part of the Bui Chu area in Nam Dinh province.

    Since the end of September, when the French colonialists used puppet troops to "sweep" and occupy the southern part of the Bui Chu area, the Vietnamese People's Army launched six successful attacks on the enemy. The main battles included: On October 6th, in Dai Dong and Giao Thuy districts of Nam Dinh province, 340 enemy soldiers from the puppet army's 712th Light Infantry Battalion were annihilated. On October 12th, in Hai Hau district, the entire puppet army's 702nd Light Infantry Battalion was wiped out; and the puppet army's 703rd and 707th Light Infantry Battalions were annihilated in Van Ly and Hai Hau districts.

    The communiqué said that after suffering heavy blows, the enemy was forced to withdraw all puppet army light infantry battalions from southern Bui Chu. Now, the guerrilla areas of Nam Dinh province, including most of Nam Truc, Truc Ninh, Nghia Hung, Hai Hau, and Giao Thuy counties, are under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army.

    Xinhua News Agency, October 30th: Military commentator Zheng Yi of the Vietnam News Agency published a commentary on the 26th entitled "The Truth About the Enemy's Military Operation Southwest of Ninh Binh," saying: The French colonialists launched a risky offensive southwest of Ninh Binh on October 15th. At the beginning of this operation, they boasted that the purpose of this offensive was to occupy Thanh Hoa province, and that this offensive was the most powerful offensive since General Leclerc launched an offensive in Indochina in 1946, and so on.

    But the fact is: The French army, which desperately concentrated and invaded from the northwest of Ninh Binh, is still within Ninh Binh province. A small group of enemy troops sneaked into Thanh Hoa province for a few kilometers, but retreated immediately for fear of being too dangerous. The French army, which arrived at Ly Nhan, 12 kilometers away from Nho Quan district southwest of Ninh Binh, was fiercely attacked by the Vietnamese People's Army, and four elite mobile companies were annihilated. On the eighth day of this battle, the enemy attempted to attack Nho Quan district again, but was driven back by the People's Army as soon as they arrived at the Nho Quan district market, suffering heavy losses. The commentary said that it is obvious that the false propaganda made by the French military headquarters cannot deceive anyone.

    The commentary pointed out: Navarre, in order to cope with the Vietnamese People's Army's autumn and winter offensive this year, in order to get more reinforcements from France, and in order to swallow the additional aid of 385 million U.S. dollars recently given to the French colonialists by Wall Street, may launch new offensives against Nho Quan district or Thanh Hoa. However, the commentary said, if the enemy insists on continuing to launch risky offensives against the liberated areas, they will suffer even greater defeats, whether in the front or in the rear. The fact that the People's Army annihilated fourteen enemy companies in the recent five days of fighting is the beginning of a disastrous defeat for the French army in this year's autumn and winter campaign.

    在解放南定省裴朱地区南部的战斗中
    越南人民军歼灭伪军十一个连和两个营
    【新华社二十九日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总司令部在二十八日发表公报说，越南人民军在歼灭伪军轻装部队十一个连和两个营以后，解放了南定省裴朱地区南部。
    自九月底法国殖民者用伪军“扫荡”并占据裴朱地区南部以来，越南人民军向敌军发动了六次胜利的攻击。其中主要战斗有：十月六日，在南定省大同、交水两县歼灭伪军第七一二轻装营的敌军三百四十名。十月十二日，在海后县，全歼伪军第七零二轻装营；并在文里、海后两县歼灭伪军第七零三和第七零七轻装营。
    公报说，敌军在遭受沉重打击后，已被迫把所有的伪军轻装营撤出裴朱南部。现在，南定省包括南直、直宁、义兴、海后和交水等县大部分的游击区已在越南人民军控制之下。
    【新华社三十日讯】越南通讯社军事评论员政义在二十六日发表题为“敌军在宁平西南军事行动的真相”的评论说：法国殖民者十月十五日在宁平西南发动了一次冒险的进攻。他们在这次行动开始时，就大吹大擂地宣传：这次进攻的目的是要占领清化省，这次进攻是一九四六年勒克莱克将军在印度支那发动进攻以来最强大的一次进攻等等。
    但是事实是：拚命集中并从宁平西北进犯的法军，现在还在宁平省境内，有一小股敌军窜入清化省境几公里，但又害怕太危险就立刻缩了回去。到达宁平西南离儒关府十二公里处里亚地方的法军，遭到越南人民军的猛烈攻击，被歼四个精锐机动连。在这一战役的第八天，敌军又企图进攻儒关府，但刚到达儒关府市场时，就被人民军打回去，损失重大。评论说，很明显，法军总司令部所作的虚妄宣传是骗不了任何人的。
    评论指出：纳瓦尔为了应付今年越南人民军的秋冬攻势，为了要从法国得到更多的援军，为了想一口吞下最近华尔街给予法国殖民者的三亿八千五百万美元的附加援助，可能还要对儒关府或清化发动新的进攻。但是，评论说，敌人若坚持继续对解放区发动冒险进攻，他们无论在前方或在后方一定会遭到更大的失败。在最近五天的战斗中，人民军歼灭敌军十四个连一事，已是法军在今年秋冬战役中遭受惨败的开始。
