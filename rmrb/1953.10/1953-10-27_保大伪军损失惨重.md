(Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 24th) North Vietnamese News: The newly established Bao Dai puppet army light infantry battalion, on which the invading French army authorities placed great hope, has suffered heavy losses at the hands of the Vietnamese People's Army in the Red River Delta over the past two months, with casualties numbering in the thousands.

　　In August, the invading French army authorities began using the newly formed light infantry battalion as cannon fodder for the French mobile forces in Nam Dinh province. General Cogny, the French army's commander in North Vietnam, boasted that he would use these puppet army light infantry battalions, which were "very suitable for pacification work," to "fiercely attack the Viet Minh's main forces." However, in actual combat, these puppet troops were repeatedly attacked by the People's Army and were routed. For example, on August 10th, the People's Army local forces attacked the puppet army's 702nd Light Infantry Battalion in Giao Thuy District, Nam Dinh Province, annihilating more than 100 enemy troops, including the battalion headquarters and two company headquarters' commanding personnel. After being replenished, the battalion was attacked again in Hai Hau District, suffering even greater casualties. From September 24th to 26th, the puppet army's 706th, 701st, and 703rd Light Infantry Battalions, stationed in Bui Chu and Hai Hau District, were all attacked, with the 701st Light Infantry Battalion suffering the heaviest losses. It was completely routed in Hai Hau District, losing 500 men, and the battalion commander was also taken prisoner. Most of the remnants who were lucky enough to escape to the south were also annihilated. By October 6th, the People's Army had again routed a puppet army light infantry battalion in Dai Dong District and Giao Thuy District, annihilating 340 puppet troops.

　　The puppet army light infantry battalions scattered in other areas also suffered heavy losses. On October 4th alone, in Mi Market, north of the capital of Hung Yen Province, the puppet army's 707th Light Infantry Battalion was annihilated by 130 men.

　　Under the attacks of the Vietnamese People's Army, the morale of the puppet troops rapidly declined. Many puppet troops were so frightened that they ran away as soon as they saw the People's Army. Many puppet troops deserted or abandoned their strongholds and fled. In one day, 25 members of the puppet army's 703rd Light Infantry Battalion, stationed in Bui Chu, surrendered to the People's Army. According to puppet troops who surrendered, many puppet troops were trying to desert because they were unwilling to sell their lives to the invaders.

　　According to United Press, French Commander-in-Chief Navarre recently had to order the French army to completely take over the areas where the Bao Dai light infantry battalions were stationed alone, because the puppet troops had been "severely hit by the Viet Minh army" and had been beaten "into a scattered mess."

    保大伪军损失惨重
    【新华社二十四日讯】北越消息：被侵越法军当局寄以很大希望的新建的保大伪军轻装营，两月来在红河三角洲遭到越南人民军的惨重打击，伤亡成千。
    八月间，侵越法军当局就开始在南定省驱使新成立的轻装营为法军机动部队充当马前卒。法军北越总司令戈涅吹嘘说要使用这些“很适宜干绥靖工作”的伪军轻装营“猛烈打击越盟的大军”。但是，在实际战斗中，这些伪军接二连三地遭到人民军的打击，溃不成军。例如在八月十日，人民军地方部队在南定省交水县进攻伪军第七零二轻装营，歼灭包括该营营部和两个连连部的指挥人员以下的敌军一百余名。该营在补充后又在海后县遭到攻击，伤亡更大。从九月二十四日到二十六日的三天中，驻扎在裴朱和海后县的伪军第七零六、第七零一、第七零三轻装营都遭到打击，其中以第七零一轻装营损失最重。它在海后县完全被击溃，损失五百人，营长也做了俘虏。侥幸漏网向南逃窜的残军也大部被歼。到十月六日，人民军又在大同县和交水县击溃伪军一个轻装营，歼灭伪军三百四十名。
    散布在其他各地的伪军轻装营也遭到很大损失。仅十月四日在兴安省会以北的米市，伪军第七零七轻装营就被歼一百三十名。
    在越南人民军的打击下，伪军士气迅速低落。许多伪军一看到人民军就吓得逃跑。不少伪军开小差或抛弃据点逃掉。驻扎在裴朱的伪军第七零三轻装营，在一天中就有二十五名向人民军投诚。据投诚的伪军透露，许多伪军正在设法开小差，因为他们不愿给侵略者卖命。
    据合众社透露，法军总司令纳瓦尔最近不得不命令法军将保大轻装营单独驻守的地区完全接管过去，因为伪军“遭受到越盟军的重创”，已被打得“七零八落”。
