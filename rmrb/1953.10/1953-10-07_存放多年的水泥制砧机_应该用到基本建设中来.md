    Long-stored Cement Block Making Machine
    Should Be Used in Capital Construction
    Reader Tian Ye writes: The Construction Company of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government Construction Engineering Bureau has a brand new cement block making machine (with motor, mud grinder, and mixer, etc.), stored in the open-air workshop of the Qianjiang Bridge Materials Depot at Zhakou Station, Hangzhou. This batch of machines was taken over by the Hangzhou Municipal Military Control Commission shortly after the liberation of Hangzhou and handed over to the Construction Company. It has been stored for more than four years now.

    During the asset inventory of Zhejiang Provincial Construction Company at the end of 1951, this batch of machines was listed in the inventory and it was noted that the Provincial Industrial Department should allocate them to units in need, but no specific action was taken. Up to now, according to the incomplete statistics of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government Construction Engineering Bureau's archives, there have been more than 30 official documents back and forth regarding the request for allocation of these machines. The handling process has lasted for nearly two years, but the problem remains unresolved.

    Currently, the wooden boxes containing this batch of machines have been mostly damaged due to long-term wind and rain erosion, and the machines have been subjected to rust. In order to avoid continued loss of state property and to quickly put this machine equipment into national capital construction, it is hoped that the state materials reserve and distribution departments will quickly handle it.

### 存放多年的水泥制砧机  应该用到基本建设中来

    存放多年的水泥制砧机
    应该用到基本建设中来
    读者田野来信：浙江省人民政府建筑工程局建筑公司有一套全新的水泥制砧机（附有马达、磨泥机和混合机等），寄存在杭州闸口车站钱江大桥材料库露天工场。这批机器是在杭州刚解放不久由杭州市军事管制委员会接收后移交给建筑公司的，到现在为止已经放了四年多。
    一九五一年底浙江省建筑公司清理资产时，曾把这批机器列入清册，并注明请省政府工业厅调拨给需用单位使用，但未作专案处理。到目前止，就浙江省人民政府建筑工程局档案材料的不完全统计，关于请调拨这批机器的来往公文已达三十多件，处理过程历时将近二年，但问题仍然得不到解决。
    目前装置这批机器的木箱经长期的风雨侵蚀，大部已经破损，机器已遭到锈蚀。为了避免国家资财继续遭受损失，并使此项机器设备很快投入国家基本建设，希望国家物资储备和分配机关迅速加以处理。
