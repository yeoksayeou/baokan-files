Please Pay More Attention to Popular Literature and Art
Lao She

I want to appeal to comrades in literary and art circles: please pay more attention to popular literature and art! This is not due to a momentary emotional surge, but a necessary call based on the actual situation of the current popular literature and art movement. Over the past four years, popular literature and art has made certain achievements and significant progress in both creation and coordination with political tasks. This is certain. However, due to improved living standards, increased cultural awareness, and the effectiveness of eliminating illiteracy, the general public urgently needs more and better popular reading materials and works that can be performed in the form of storytelling and ballad singing. The supply, however, lags far behind this widespread and pressing need. Therefore, the creation of today's popular literature and art still needs to be promoted and invigorated!

Pick up the Beijing Daily and take a look. The theater advertisement column's programs are always "The Young Son-in-Law," "Liu Qiao'er," and "Luo Han Qian" year after year. After the National Opera Festival, "Zhu Yingtai," "The Legend of the White Snake," and "Liu Hai Cuts Firewood," which are also still imperfect folk legend programs, were added. The masses and actors alike unanimously demand the performance of new programs, but one or two years have passed, and the writers have not yet put pen to paper! I know that we are all working hard year-round, not slacking off, but in fact, we are being negligent. Otherwise, why would Liu Qiao'er and the Young Son-in-Law be so stubborn as to refuse to take a break? If the capital is like this, other places are probably similar, if not worse.

Look at Quyi (folk art forms) again: some old pieces are no longer popular with the masses, while new pieces are often bad. Performers don't want to sing them, and the masses don't want to listen. Good ones, shamefully, are still very few! As a result, today's Quyi shows little vitality, which affects the lives and emotions of some performers. No one dares to say that Quyi is not a concise and powerful propaganda tool. Facts tell us that not only workers, peasants, and soldiers like it, but also schools and institutions cannot do without it for propaganda or entertainment activities. Quyi can reach places that drama and dance cannot. In terms of manpower and money, Quyi is also more economical than drama and dance. Unfortunately, writers have not been able to provide enough good works, and workers, peasants, soldiers, and students and cadres in institutions often have to write them themselves. Friends, intentional or unintentional, we seem to be a bit negligent in this area!

This requires a look at the popular literature and art publications in various places. These publications should be supply stations for popular reading materials and opera scripts. However, I know that the biggest pain of these supply stations themselves is the lack of abundant manuscripts. Taking the "Shuo Shuo Chang Chang" (Talk and Sing) publication as an example, the editorial department receives hundreds or thousands of manuscripts every month, but the editors worry day and night that they will not be able to collect and publish the manuscripts on time because the majority of the hundreds and thousands of submissions are practice exercises on exercise books. The handwriting of established writers and writers with existing achievements is rarely seen. Because the published works are not very good, and because writers do not write much popular work, there is an incorrect view in society that popular reading materials are lower-level, easy-to-write literary works, and should be used as a trial run. Therefore, literary enthusiasts who have not yet written prose fluently begin to practice popular rhyming prose. We should not stop their enthusiastic practice, but it is also a fact that it is difficult to select excellent works from such hundreds and thousands of trials.

Since there are very few good external contributions, the comrades in the editorial department have to temporarily mobilize a few friends who care about popular literature and art to help, or write themselves in order to ensure timely publication. In this way, popular literature and art publications gradually become the domain of the editors of popular literature and art publications and some "experts." This does not seem to be a good phenomenon. Today, the unity of literary and art workers is getting better and better, but based on the above situation, we cannot help but feel as if there is still a boundary here: some specialize in improvement and can largely ignore popularization work; others specialize in popularization, isolated and helpless.

Most of the writers who specialize in popularization work understand some storytelling and ballad singing forms, have fairly good writing skills, and are enthusiastic about serving popularization work. In the first year or two after liberation, they wrote many so-called task-driven propaganda pieces and made some contributions. Now, some are editors of popular literature and art publications, and some have become regular suppliers of popular literature and art works. In the past two years, after political and ideological learning and professional learning, they unanimously demanded to write works with strong ideological and artistic qualities. They realized that their previous works were not good enough. This wish and demand are commendable. However, works with both strong ideological and artistic qualities cannot be written in a short time. Some of them have become overly ambitious and dare not put pen to paper easily.

In this way, not many people who specialize in improvement participate in popularization work, and some who specialize in popularization are hesitant to write. Popular literature and art is then shelved! This situation should not continue. That's why I said earlier that the creation of today's popular literature and art still needs to be promoted and invigorated, so I want to appeal to comrades!

I don't want to promote a certain form of popular literature and art here. That would make the problem too narrow, and narrowness itself is a shortcoming. There are many, many forms of popular literature and art, and each place preserves some special forms. As long as we pay attention to popular literature and art, we will take materials locally and start learning. What we want is a hundred flowers blooming, not a unified form. In the past three or four years, popular literature and art works have mostly only used a few forms such as fast clapper talk and drum ballad, which is a shortcoming. Even more ridiculous, some people have never heard the northern drum ballad in person, but instead of using local customs, the form readily available, they copy drum ballads from newspapers and publications, drawing a tiger like a cat. This seems to be called formalism! Our problem is that everyone has not paid enough attention to popular literature and art. As long as attention is paid, forms are inexhaustible. Moreover, after mastering the old forms, we can also break through the forms and bring forth new ideas. We really haven't paid attention to it. Otherwise, not to mention the various local folk songs and folk arts, how could our large-scale storytelling (at least dozens of books!) still not have been organized today? Isn't this a very important heritage, including "Romance of the States," "Eastern and Western Han Dynasties," "Three Kingdoms," "Sui and Tang Dynasties," "Saying Yue," "Ming Dynasty Martyrs," etc., which have always been used by the people to obtain historical knowledge? Speaking of this, we also need to ask experts who have studied classical and folk literature and art to participate more in popular literature and art work, in order to combine research with practice and solve the problems of how to learn from folk literature and art, how to collect and organize folk literature and art, and so on.

I don't want to beg a certain writer here to hurry up and learn popular literature and art. I encourage all writers to do so! In this way, we can easily combine improvement and popularization and no longer treat them separately. Improvement and popularization are originally consistent. Let's talk about it based on facts: please see, isn't there a commonly existing problem in today's novels – the language is not popular enough? I think no one would stubbornly say: This novel of mine is for improvement. The fewer readers, the better; the more incomprehensible, the better! There will be no such thing! Conversely, the two great works, "Water Margin" and "Dream of the Red Chamber," are readable and therefore loved by everyone, so much so that they are read over and over again. I don't think anyone would say: These two great works suffered because the language was too popular. No matter how profound the ideology of our works is and how rich the content is, if our language is not popular and readily available, it cannot become a work with national characteristics that is loved by the people.

Where does national style come from? The first thing is to find it in the language. You can never write a work with Chinese national characteristics using Goethe's language. German is German, and Chinese is Chinese. They cannot be substituted for each other. Some of our novels today have suffered because the language in them is neither one thing nor another, failing to fully exert the beauty of our language, which has led to a loss of national style. If reading our creations is no different from reading translated works, how can the people love them from the bottom of their hearts and be educated by their love?

In many of our novels, writers often do not come up with refined language based on the emotions and thoughts that the characters in a certain plot should have. Instead, they use the language of newspapers and publications throughout the entire article to elaborate on the facts in general terms. We don't seem to have many texts like Wu Song's fight against the tiger in "Water Margin" because if we were to write about Wu Song fighting the tiger, it might be like this: "Wu Song, he raised his vigilance, with unparalleled courage, waiting for the opportunity to give the angry tiger a ruthless blow!" Yes, these sentences are just made up by me. However, I have encountered similar texts in our works, and more than once! Comrades, if we listen to folk tales, watch folk operas, and listen to storytelling artists narrate "idle books," we will revise our novels with "unparalleled courage"! Of course, the language of folk tales and storytelling artists is often somewhat stale, but even so, they all find plots and vivid language according to the life they can understand, instead of rigidly and generally narrating. In order to make the language lively and vivid, they often sacrifice truth to move the audience. They will teach Bao Gong to explode his beard, roll up his sleeves, and personally execute Chen Shimei. We should not learn that outdated language, nor should we learn this excessive exaggeration. We want to learn their method of using language. If they described the weather as hot like we do, only saying "The weather is so hot!"; if they described disorder, they would only say "That's so messy!", I guarantee they would all starve to death! Who would listen to them say how hot and messy it is? To describe heat, they would teach the audience to untie their buttons involuntarily!

Yes, language is not everything, but we all know that language is indeed our tool. What kind of carpenter is a carpenter who cannot use a saw and a plane?

Our poems have the same problem, or even a bigger problem than prose. We often say: Poetry is the crystallization of language. However, the biggest shortcoming of our new poetry is that it has failed to do this. It seems that the poets have not used all their strength to mobilize and refine the language, so it is no wonder that it cannot crystallize. Let's just take two lines of ancient poetry as an example: "Two orioles sing on the green willow, a row of white egrets fly to the blue sky." These are not very great lines of poetry. However, the poet did use all his strength to write them. In these two lines that everyone can understand, there are four different colors: yellow, green, white, and blue, as well as two numbers, two actions, two kinds of birds, one kind of tree, and the largest thing – the blue sky. There is also music inside, the singing of the orioles. There is not a single unfamiliar word here, and a beautiful realm with sound and color is drawn. Linguistically, they have natural rhythm, clear colors, and pleasant sounds. The poet used all the beauty of language without skimping on anything. Look at our poems again. There may be very deep thoughts and feelings inside, but the language has not achieved a just right arrangement where one more word is impossible and one less word is impossible. Our poems are like green caterpillars that can turn into butterflies. The butterflies are indeed inside, but unfortunately, they have not been able to fly. Good poems are where thoughts, feelings, images, words, and music grow together in the most exquisite way, so that readers cannot help but dance and sing repeatedly. Our current poems do not have this kind of magic, so it is no wonder that they cannot be passed down for a while, let alone for thousands of years.

Yes, we should learn classical poetry. However, most of the classical works are written in classical Chinese, which cannot exactly solve our problem. Speaking of this, I want to present a treasure, which is folk popular poetry. Yes, there is also a part of classical Chinese in popular poetry, but generally speaking, it is mainly based on vernacular. Although it uses vernacular, it has inherited and considerably developed the rhythm of ancient poetry. It can withstand the test of recitation and singing. Therefore, listening to a section of drum ballad, no matter how clumsy the language is, we can at least get some benefits. That is to say, its rhythm is beautiful, otherwise it cannot be performed. Even if it has no other advantages, it does indeed grasp the musicality of the language. The musicality of language is an important factor in the composition of poetry. Secondly, although the words used in folk poetry may not be refined in every word, there are many places where folk language is cleverly used. The emotions aroused by these languages and the imaginations caused are both elegant and popular, and everyone shares them. Unlike some classical poems that are only enough for literati to chant and appreciate. Our shortcomings, in my opinion, are that our poems lack the beauty of rhythm, and cannot be chanted, let alone sung. A poem that cannot be chanted is like a piano without strings. Another shortcoming of ours is that we are not good at using folk language and do not have a deep and simple effect. We often use exclamation points to replace words full of emotion, and often pile up a lot of general rhetoric, making readers confused. We do not gradually arouse emotions with deep and simple methods, like the waves behind urging the waves in front, gradually forming a climax. Instead, we often want to grab the reader's heart by using a few words that we think are great. To use an analogy, we smear the paper with thick ink and call it a landscape painting. As a result, there is only a black mess, and no landscape. Therefore, learning from folk poetry will definitely not be fruitless. We must mobilize the rhythm in the poem and use the language of the people to make up for the past shortcomings. We must express our thoughts and feelings in the most beautiful language. In this way, we can consolidate and develop the national style. A poem without national style is nothing.

I do not require all writers to immediately put down the work at hand and immediately write drum ballads or critique operas, although doing so would be greatly beneficial to popular literature and art. I mean, whether you write popular works or not, it is always beneficial to learn. Of course, it is currently an urgent requirement for more writers to participate in popularization work. Even writers who specialize in prose will definitely not suffer if they learn popular rhyming prose. Only by learning rhyming prose can you understand what refinement and conciseness are. From my personal experience, I have studied classical and folk rhyming prose. Although I am not good at writing rhyming prose, my prose has improved a bit because of this. I revise my prose just as I revise my rhyming prose, and I am not willing to be lazy. In prose, I also do not forget the beauty of rhythm and sound, so sometimes I can achieve how to write and how to read, consistent words. I feel that if you use the energy of writing poetry to write prose, it can be called striving for perfection. Then poetry that is prosaic can be said to be shoddy.

What I said seems a little conservative. I must say that I do not mean to abandon the new and restore the old. I think that since there is no literature in the world that suddenly emerges from the flat ground, we must pay attention to tradition. Learning the old is just a means. The real purpose is to bring forth new ideas.

I earnestly hope that more writers will participate in popularization work because of my call and write popular rhyming prose and prose that is sonorous and rings like metal when it hits the ground so that popular literature and art work can become active like a storm and meet the general and urgent needs of the people!

### 请多注意通俗文艺

专栏：

    请多注意通俗文艺
    老舍
    我要向文艺界同志们呼吁：请多注意通俗文艺！这并不由于一时的感情激动，而是按照目前通俗文艺运动的实际情况，不能不作这样的呼吁。四年来，通俗文艺在创作上与在配合政治任务上都有了一定的成绩和很大的发展。这是肯定的。可是目前，因生活的改善，文化的提高，与扫除文盲的成效，人民大众普遍地迫切地需要更多的与更好的通俗读物与可用说唱形式表演的作品。供给却远远落在这普遍而迫切的需要后边。因此，今天的通俗文艺的创作还需要推动与振作！
    拿起北京日报看看吧，戏剧广告栏里的节目一年到头总是小女婿、刘巧儿、罗汉钱这几出；在全国戏曲会演之后，才又添上了祝英台、白蛇传、刘海砍樵几个也还欠完美的民间传说节目。群众与演员们一致地要求新节目的上演，可是一年二年地过去了，作家们还没有动笔！我知道，我们都终年辛辛苦苦，并没偷闲，可是事实上我们是怠了工；要不然为什么刘巧儿与小女婿会那么顽强地不肯去休息休息呢？首都如是，各地恐怕也如是，假若不是更差一些的话。
    再看看曲艺吧：一部分的老段子已不受群众欢迎，而新段子呢，坏的很多，艺人不愿唱，群众不愿听；好的呢，惭愧，还少得很！这样，今天的曲艺就显出没有多少生气，因而影响到一部分艺人的生活与情绪。没有人敢说曲艺不是短小精悍的宣传利器。事实告诉我们，不但工人、农民、部队都喜欢它，就是学校与机关里作宣传或文娱活动也一定缺不了它。戏剧歌舞所不能到的地方，曲艺可以去到；在人力与金钱上，曲艺也比戏剧歌舞更能节约。可惜，作家们并没能供给足够的好的作品，而工人、农民、部队以及学生与机关干部往往得自己动手去写。朋友们，有意还是无意的呢，我们在这一方面似乎又有点怠工！
    这就须看看各处的通俗文艺刊物了。这些刊物理应是通俗读物与戏曲稿本的供给站。可是，我知道，这些供给站本身的最大痛苦就是没有丰富的稿源。以“说说唱唱”这个刊物说，编辑部每月都能接到几百或上千件的稿子，可是编辑们却日夜发愁到时候不能集稿发稿，因为成百成千的来稿多数是练习簿子上的习作，老作家与已有成绩的作家们的笔迹是很难见到的。因为发表了的作品不很好，因为作家们不大写通俗作品，社会上就有了一种不正确的看法，以为通俗读物是低一级的容易写的文艺作品，应当用它试手，所以还没有把散文写通顺的文艺爱好者就开始习作通俗韵文了。我们不应拦阻他们热诚地练习，但是由这样成百成千的试作中很难选出精品也是事实。
    好的外稿既很少，编辑部同志们就不能不临时动员几位关心通俗文艺的朋友来帮忙，或亲自动手赶写，以便到期不误发稿。这样，通俗文艺刊物就渐渐地成为通俗文艺刊物的编辑们与一些“专家”的园地了。这似乎不是个好现象。在今天，文艺工作者的团结是越来越好了，可是由上述的情形来看，我们不由地感到彷佛在这里还有一条界限：有的专搞提高，对普及工作可以不大过问；有的专搞普及，孤立无援。
    大部分专门搞普及工作的作家们是懂得一些说唱形式，有相当好的文字技巧，而且热诚地服务于普及工作的。他们在解放后的一二年内，曾经写过不少所谓赶任务的宣传品，立过一些功，现在有的担任了通俗文艺刊物的编辑，有的成为通俗文艺作品的经常供应者。近二年来，经过政治思想学习与业务学习，他们一致地要求去写思想性与艺术性都强的作品。他们看出自己从前的作品是不够好的。这个愿望与要求是值得称赞的。可是，思想性与艺术性俱强的作品又不是一时半会儿所能写出的。他们之中有的就变成了眼高手低，不敢轻易落笔了。
    这样，专搞提高的参加普及工作的不多，而专搞普及的又有的已迟迟不敢动笔，通俗文艺可就搁了浅！这个情况不应再延续下去。所以我在前面说过，今天的通俗文艺的创作还需要推动与振作，所以我要向同志们呼吁！
    我并不想在这里提倡某种通俗文艺的形式。那么一来，就把问题看得太狭隘了，而狭隘本身就是缺点。通俗文艺的形式有很多很多，每个地方都保存着一些特殊的形式。我们只要一注意通俗文艺，我们就会就地取材，开始学习。我们要的是百花齐放，不是形式统一。在过去的三四年里，通俗文艺作品多数只运用了快板、鼓词之类的几个形式，正是个缺点。更可笑的，有的人向来没有亲耳听过北方的大鼓，却放着本地风光，近水楼台的形式不用，而从报纸与刊物上照猫画虎地摹写鼓词，这似乎可以叫作形式主义吧！我们的问题是大家还没有充分注意通俗文艺；只要一经注意，形式是取之不竭的。而且在掌握了旧形式之后，还可以突破形式，推陈出新。我们的确没有注意它，要不然，且不说地方上的各种各样歌谣曲艺，就是我们的大部头的评书（至少有几十部！）怎么会到今天还没人下手整理呢？难道这包括着列国、东西汉、三国、隋唐、说岳、明英烈等，一向是民间借以取得历史知识的演义，不是很重要的遗产么？说到这里，我们也有必要请求对古典与民间文艺有研究的专家们多参加通俗文艺工作，以便把研究与实际结合起来，解决如何向民间文艺学习，如何搜集和整理民间文艺等等问题。
    我也不想在这里恳求某一位作家赶紧从事学习通俗文艺，我鼓动所有的作家这么办！这样一交代，我们便很容易把提高与普及并为一谈，而不再把它们分别看待了。提高与普及本来是一致的。让我们从事实上说吧：请看，今天的小说不是就有一个普遍存在着的问题么——语言欠通俗。我想，没有人会硬着头皮说：我这部小说是为提高的，读者越少越好，越不懂越好！不会有这种事！反过来说，水浒传与红楼梦两大著作是大家念得懂，因而喜欢念的，以至百读不厌。我想，也不会有人说：这两大著作因语言通俗而吃了亏。不管我们的作品的思想性如何高深，内容如何丰富，假若我们的语言不通俗不现成，它就不可能成为具有民族风格，为人民所喜爱的作品。
    民族风格从哪儿来呢？首要的是在语言里找。用歌德的语言永远写不出具有中国民族风格的作品。德国话是德国话，中国话是中国话，彼此不能代用。我们今天的一部分小说吃了亏，因为其中的语言不三不四，没能充分发挥我们的语言之美，于是也就教民族风格受了损失。假若念我们的创作和念翻译作品没有什么分别，那怎会能使人民由心眼里喜爱，由喜爱而受到教育呢？
    在我们的许多小说里，作家往往不就某一情节中人物应有的感情与思想提出精练的语言，而是通篇都笼统地用报纸上刊物上的语言敷陈事实。我们似乎还没有许多像水浒传中武松打虎那样的文字，因为我们假若写武松打虎，可能是这样的：“武松，他提高了警惕，以无比的英勇，等待机会，再给愤怒的老虎以无情的打击！”是的，这几句是我瞎诌的。可是，我在我们的作品里遇到过与此类似的文字，而且不止一次！同志们，假若我们去听听民间的故事，看看民间的戏曲，听听评书艺人怎么评讲“闲书”，我们就会以“无比的英勇”修改我们的小说了！自然，民间故事与评书艺人的语言往往有些陈腐了的，但是即使如此，他们都是按照他们所能理解的生活找出情节与绘色绘声的语言，而不是死死板板地笼统叙说。他们为求语言的生动活泼，往往不惜牺牲了真实，去打动听众。他们会教包公气炸了胡子，高挽起袖子，亲自动手去铡陈士美。我们不应学那陈旧的语言，也不必学这种过火的夸大。我们是要学他们运用语言的方法。假若他们像我们那样形容天气热就光说“天那个热呀”；形容没有秩序就光说“那个乱呀”，我管保他们都会饿死的！谁去听他们说那个热呀与那个乱呢？他们要形容热，就会教听众不由地解开钮扣！
    不错，语言不是一切；但是我们都知道，语言的确是我们的工具。一个木匠不会用锯和刨子，还成什么木匠师傅呢？
    我们的诗有同样的毛病，或者比散文的毛病更大一些。我们常说：诗是语言的结晶。可是，我们的新诗的最大的一个缺点就是它没能作到这一点。诗人们好像是没有用全力去调动、推敲语言，也就难怪它不能结晶。让我们随便拿两句古诗来看看吧：“两个黄鹂鸣翠柳，一行白鹭上青天。”这不是怎么了不起的两句诗。可是，诗人的确用了全力去写出它们。在这谁都能看懂听懂的两句里，有黄翠白青四个不同的颜色，还有两个数目，两个动作，两种飞禽，一种树，一种最大的东西——青天。里边还有音乐，黄鹂的鸣声。这里没有一个生字，而画出了一片有声有色的美丽境界。从语言上说，它们有自然的音节，明朗的色彩，悦耳的声音。诗人运用了所有的语言之美，丝毫没有偷工减料。再看看我们的诗呢，里边也许有很深的思想与感情，可是语言没能作到不能多一分也不能少一分的恰到好处的配备。我们的诗就好像是可以变成蝴蝶的绿虫，蝴蝶的确是在里边，可惜还没能飞起来。好的诗是思想、感情、形象、文字，与音乐最精妙地生长在一处的，所以能使读者不由地手舞足蹈，一唱三叹。我们现在的诗还没有这种魔力，也就难怪不能传诵一时，更不要说传诵千古了。
    是的，我们应当学习古典诗歌。不过，古典作品的绝大部分是用文言写的，还不能恰好地足以解决我们的问题。说到这里，我要献宝了，这宝贝就是民间的通俗诗歌。不错，通俗的诗歌里也有一部分文言；但大体上说，它是以白话为主。虽然用的是白话，它却承袭了并且相当发展了古诗的音节韵律。它经得起朗诵与歌唱的考验。因此，听一段鼓词，不管其中的语言多么拙劣，我们至少可以得到一些好处。这就是说，它的音节是美好的，否则不能演唱出来。即使它没有别的好处，它可的确抓住了语言的音乐性。语言的音乐性原是诗歌构成的重要因素。其次，民间诗歌中的用字虽然未必字字精到，可是有不少地方巧妙地运用了民间语言。由这些语言所激起的感情与所引起的想像都是雅俗共赏，人人共有的。不像某些古典诗词那样只足以供骚人墨客的吟味欣赏。我们的缺点，据我看，就是在我们的诗歌里缺少音节之美，既不能吟，更不能唱。不能吟唱的诗就好像没有弦的琴。我们的另一缺点是不善于运用民间语言，没有深入浅出的效果。我们往往用惊叹号去代替富有感情的字，往往堆砌一大堆泛泛的修词，使读者莫名其妙。我们不用深入浅出的方法渐渐逼起感情，如后浪的催前浪，渐成高潮，而往往想借着几个自以为了不起的字汇抓住读者的心灵。打个比喻，我们是用浓墨抹满了纸，而称之为山水画。结果呢，只有黑糊糊的一片，并没有山水。因此，我们从民间的诗歌去学习学习，一定不会是劳而无功的。我们必须调动好诗中的音节，必须运用人民的语言，以补过去的缺欠。我们必须用最美的语言道出我们的思想与感情。这样，我们才能巩固、发展民族的风格。没有民族风格的诗便什么也不是。
    我并不要求所有的作家都马上放下他手下的工作，而立刻去写鼓词或评戏，虽然那么办是大有利于通俗文艺的。我是说，不管你写不写通俗作品，学一学总是有益的；当然，多一些作家来参加普及工作是目前的迫切要求。就是专写散文的作家，学一学通俗韵文也一定不会吃亏。只有学习韵文才能明白什么叫推敲与精炼。以我个人的经验来说，我学习过古典的与民间的韵文，虽然我写不好韵文，我的散文却因此多少有一些进步。我修改散文，正像修改韵文那么不肯偷懒。在散文中，我也不忘了音节与声音之美，所以我有时候能作到怎么写怎么念，言文一致。我觉得：假若用写诗的力气去写散文，可以叫作精益求精，那么散文化的诗就可以说是偷工减料。
    我这样说似乎有点偏于保守。我必须说，我没有弃新复古的意思。我以为，世界上既没有忽然由平地冒出来的文学，我们就不能不重视传统。学习旧的不过是手段，真正的目的却在推陈出新。
    我切盼因我的呼吁而增多参加普及工作的作家，而且写出铿铿然，落地作金石声的通俗韵文与散文，使通俗文艺工作风起云涌地活跃起来，能够满足人民普遍的迫切的需要！
