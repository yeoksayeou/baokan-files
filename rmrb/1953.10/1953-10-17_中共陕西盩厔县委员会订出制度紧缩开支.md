    CCP Zhouzhi County Committee in Shaanxi Province Establishes System to Curtail Spending
    Reader Jia Xingzhong writes: The Zhouzhi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shaanxi Province began to change the phenomenon of overspending on office expenses in the past, starting in June of this year. In the five months prior to June, the monthly office expenses of the county committee organs exceeded the budgeted standards. For example, in March, the telephone expenses alone accounted for more than 45 percent of the entire monthly office expense budget. To change this situation, in early June, the county committee, on the one hand, held general meetings and various professional meetings to conduct ideological mobilization, inspect, and criticize the work style of some cadres and service personnel who did not cherish public property; on the other hand, it formulated a number of systems through discussion by everyone. For example: strengthen the management of telephone use; the telephone room shall set up a telephone usage registration book; each department must obtain approval from the responsible comrade of the headquarters before calling each district or the higher authorities, and conduct registration; the caller must prepare in advance to make the speech brief and concise, reduce the time, and reduce power consumption. General office supplies are uniformly controlled by the accounting office, and a receipt registration book is established. If too much is received, it must be reviewed and approved by the responsible comrade of the county committee secretariat. Engrave documents carefully, do not print bad paper, do not engrave bad plates, do not waste ink, and do not print too many copies. Public bicycles shall be assigned to designated personnel by each department for safekeeping. They should generally not be ridden for personal matters. Those who ride bicycles for public affairs should carefully protect the vehicles to avoid damage. Other items such as desks, stools, and utensils should also be carefully protected and cherished. Since then, the phenomenon of office expenses exceeding the budgeted standards has gradually been eliminated. The expenditures in June and July were balanced with the budgeted standards; there was a surplus in August, especially the telephone expenses were reduced to about one-fifth of those in March. Office expenses have been saved, but the work that should be done has not been reduced; on the contrary, the efficiency of some work has been improved. For example, the printing of documents not only avoids waste, but also the printed documents are clearer and look better than before, and the number of typos and omissions has also been reduced. After the office expenses were saved, the number of newspapers subscribed to by the organs could be increased. From September, the original ten copies were increased to thirteen copies, and each of the two cadres sent by the county committee to the base point villages also subscribed to a copy.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    中共陕西盩厔县委员会订出制度紧缩开支
    读者贾兴中来信：中共陕西盩厔县委员会从今年六月份开始，改变了过去机关办公用费的超支现象。在六月份以前的五个月中，县委机关每月办公用费的开支都超出了预算标准，如三月份单是电话费一项开支就占这一个月全部办公费用预算标准的百分之四十五以上。为了改变这种情况，六月上旬，县委一方面召开大会及各个专业会议进行思想动员，检查和批判了一些干部及勤杂人员的不爱护公物的作风；一方面又通过大家讨论订出了一些制度。如：加强对使用电话的管理，电话室设使用电话登记簿；各部门向各区或向上级通话，均须经过本部负责同志批准，进行登记；通话者事前必须作好准备，务使说话简短扼要，缩减时间，减少耗电。一般办公用品由会计室统一掌握，设立领取登记簿，如领取过多，须经县委秘书处负责同志审查批准。刻印文件要细心，不印坏纸，不刻坏版，不浪费油墨，不多印份数。公用自行车由各部门分别指定专人负责保管，一般私事不骑，因公骑车者应对车辆经心爱护，避免损坏。其他如办公桌、凳、用具等也要注意保管爱护。此后，办公用费的开支超过预算标准的现象就逐渐消灭了。六、七两月的开支与预算标准平衡；八月份已有了节余，尤其是电话费降低为三月份的五分之一左右。办公用费节约了，但该做的工作并没有少做；相反地，某些工作的效率提高了。如刻印文件，不仅避免了浪费现象，而且所印文件比以前清楚好看了，错、漏字也减少了。办公费节省以后，机关所订报纸就得以增加，九月份起由原来的十份增加到十三份，还给县委员会派驻基点村的两个干部也各订了一份。
