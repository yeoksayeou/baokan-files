Dear brothers!
    October 1953 witnessed a historically significant event in the development of the world trade union movement. Eight hundred and nineteen delegates from seventy-nine countries, including three hundred and forty-two representatives from many trade union organizations not affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions, gathered in a friendly and united atmosphere at the Third World Trade Union Congress in Vienna. They freely and democratically expressed at the Congress the aspirations of the working people of all countries to improve their living conditions and strive for democratic freedom and peace.
    The delegates attending the Third World Trade Union Congress represented different national and international trade union organizations. They came from different races, had different religious beliefs and political views. Many of the representatives were nominated by the working people at their workplaces and came directly from the factories. This gave the Congress an unprecedented character: this session included representatives of various trade union organizations, and this Congress reflected the opinions of all aspects of the world trade union movement and the views of ordinary workers. At the same time, it was a mass congress, a congress that brought together representatives of various trade union organizations and individuals.
    Despite the diverse composition of the Congress, it reached a common conclusion: that in colonial and semi-colonial countries, as well as in developed capitalist countries, real wages are constantly falling, social insurance is inadequate, and large-scale unemployment either exists or has become a direct threat. On the other hand, trade union rights and democratic rights are increasingly being violated. Any honest person, whether man or woman, cannot fail to recognize that this is a correct assessment of the status quo.
    The Congress was unanimous in its view of these facts. It concluded that only through the united action of working people participating in various trade unions and holding various beliefs can the status quo be rapidly changed, can wages and the living standards of working people be improved, can international ties be expanded, and can peace and national independence be guaranteed. This conclusion is based on the experience of the various trade union organizations participating in the Congress, which indicated that where there is united action, they can achieve their demands. If this experience of united action within various countries can be extended to the international trade union sphere, then nothing can prevent the forward movement of the laboring masses.
    The World Federation of Trade Unions is based on this spirit of unity, and therefore, it has repeatedly suggested to the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" and the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions that they discuss the issue of unified action on the basis of a jointly formulated minimum demands program. However, the leaders of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" gave insulting replies, refusing to reach any agreement with the World Federation of Trade Unions.
    The reason why the leaders of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" adopted this attitude is that the leaders of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations control the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions." Their aim is to bring the members of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" under the control of the policies of the US State Department and commercial giants. But we cannot believe that trade unions such as the British Trades Union Congress, the trade unions of the Scandinavian countries, and especially those of the colonial and semi-colonial countries, can be forced to accept their policies. We do not believe that trade unions with a long tradition of fighting to defend the interests of working people can allow their activities to be subordinated to the desires of US imperialism. Nor do we believe that honest trade union leaders who want to defend the interests of working people can stand idly by and watch the interests of their union members being trampled upon, and their freedom of action being suppressed.
    The proceedings of this broad Third World Trade Union Congress, representing eighty-eight million six hundred and sixty thousand working people, show that the basis for united action can be found among trade union organizations of various tendencies and backgrounds, without infringing upon their freedom of activity or the rights of these union members to determine their own union policies.
    Precisely because we have complete faith in the sincerity and consciousness of the working people, we directly, urgently, and sincerely appeal to the various national and local trade union leaders and all working people belonging to the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" or the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions to take united action.
    We appeal to all personnel in your countries, localities, enterprises, and trade unions: you should regard each other as laboring brothers, regardless of race, nationality, religion, or political differences.
    You must unite to oppose those who want to divide your ranks, undermine your unity, and weaken the strength of the working class. You must unite to fight for improving your living conditions, for defending your democratic and trade union rights, and for permanently ending the threat to world peace.
    You must launch a movement for trade union unity of action on an international scale. You must eliminate the artificial divisions that have occurred in recent years. United action can lead the working class to a new stage, a stage of trust and progress, and it can enable us to achieve great victories, striving for the improvement of living conditions and the establishment of international peace.
    The united action of the working people of all countries will create a happy future for mankind. (Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 22nd, TASS)

### 给没有参加世界工联的所有工会组织和工会会员的公开信

专栏：

    给没有参加世界工联的所有工会组织和工会会员的公开信亲爱的兄弟们！
    一九五三年十月在世界工会运动发展中发生了具有历史意义的事件。来自七十九个国家的八百一十九名代表，其中包括未加入世界工联的许多工会组织的三百四十二名代表，在维也纳世界工会第三次代表大会上在友好和团结的气氛中相聚一堂。他们既自由又民主地在大会上表达了各国劳动人民要求改善自己生活条件和争取民主自由与和平的愿望。
    出席世界工会第三次代表大会的代表，代表着不同的全国性和国际性的工会组织，他们是来自不同的种族，具有不同的宗教信仰和政治观点。其中有许多代表是由劳动人民在工作岗位上推举出来，是直接从工厂中来的。这就赋予代表大会从来没有的特点：在这次会上有着各种各样的工会组织的代表，这次大会表现了世界工会运动中各方面的意见和普通工人的看法。同时这也是一个群众性的代表大会，是集合了各种各样工会组织和个人的代表大会。
    尽管代表大会的成份是各种各样的，但它却得出了共同的结论：即在殖民地、半殖民地国家以及资本主义发达的国家中，实际工资不断下降，社会保险事业做得不够，大批工人失业的现象或是已经存在，或已成为一种直接的危险，另一方面，工会权利和民主权利日益遭到侵害。新战争的阴影经常威胁着劳动人民。凡是正直的人，无论他是男子还是妇女，都不能不承认这就是对现状正确的估计。
    代表大会对这些事实的看法是一致的。它作出结论：只有参加各种工会以及具有各种信仰的劳动人民行动一致，才能迅速改变现状，才能使工资和劳动人民的生活水平得到提高，才能扩大国际联系和保证和平与民族独立。这种论断是根据参加代表大会的各工会组织的经验而作出的，这些工会组织表示，那里的行动一致，那里就能达到自己的要求。这种各个国家内行动一致的经验，如果能扩大到国际性的工会范围内来，那就随便什么也不能阻挡劳动人民群众运动的向前推进。
    世界工会联合会就是以这种团结一致的思想为基础的，因此，它不只一次地向“国际自由工会联合会”和国际基督教工会联合会建议，在共同制订的最低要求的纲领的基础上讨论一致行动的问题。但是“国际自由工会联合会”的头子们作了侮辱性的答复，拒绝了与世界工会联合会取得任何协议。
    “国际自由工会联合会”领袖们之所以采取这种态度，是由于美国劳联和产联的领袖们控制了
    “国际自由工会联合会”。他们的目的是要使“国际自由工会联合会”的会员们受美国国务院和商业巨子们的政策的控制。但是我们不能相信，能够强迫这样一些工会如英国职工大会、斯堪的纳维亚各国的工会，尤其是殖民地和半殖民地国家的工会，接受他们的政策。我们不相信，有着为保卫劳动人民利益而斗争的悠久传统的工会，能让它们自己的活动服从于美帝国主义的愿望。我们也不相信，那些想要捍卫劳动人民利益的正直的工会领袖能袖手旁观，看着他们工会会员的利益被蹂躏，看着他们的行动自由受到压制。
    这一次代表着八千八百六十万劳动人民的广泛的世界工会第三次代表大会的进程说明，行动一致的基础能够从各种不同倾向和不同背景的工会组织中求得，同时又不侵犯它们的活动自由或是这些工会会员决定自己工会的政策和权利。
    正因为我们完全相信劳动人民的真诚与自觉，我们才直接向属于“国际自由工会联合会”或是国际基督教工会联合会的各个全国性的和地方性的工会领袖们和全体劳动人民急迫和诚恳地呼吁他们行动一致。
    我们向你们各个国家、地方、企业和工会的全体人员呼吁：你们应不分种族、国籍、宗教或是政治的区别，而互相看成是劳动兄弟。
    你们要共同起来反对那些想要分裂你们的队伍、破坏你们的团结和削弱工人阶级力量的人。你们要团结起来为改善你们的生活条件，为保卫你们的民主权利和工会权利，为永远结束对世界和平的威胁而斗争。
    你们要在国际规模上展开争取工会行动一致的运动。你们要消除近年来发生的人为的分裂现象。行动一致可以把工人阶级引向新的阶段，引向信任和进步的阶段，它可以使我们取得巨大的胜利，争取生活条件的改善和国际和平的建立。
    各国劳动人民的一致行动将创造人类幸福的将来。  （新华社据塔斯社维也纳二十二日讯）
