     Zhangjiakou Commissioner's Office of Culture and Education
     Should Not Blindly Increase Physics and Chemistry Teachers

    A letter from Zhang Yulin, a graduate of Hebei Normal College: The Hebei Provincial Department of Education assigned eleven of our graduates this year to the Zhangjiakou Special District as junior high school physics and chemistry teachers. However, the Zhangjiakou Special District does not need that many physics and chemistry teachers. As a result, six of the eleven were reassigned to teach Chinese, education, art, physical education, or music. Another classmate was first assigned to Wei County Middle School to teach chemistry, but because the school had no chemistry course, he was transferred to Chaigoubao Normal School. The original chemistry teacher at Chaigoubao Normal School was then transferred to Wei County Middle School to teach physiology and hygiene. I was originally assigned to Yangquan Middle School to teach chemistry, but I didn't go because the school had no chemistry course either.

    According to our understanding, among the twenty middle schools in the Zhangjiakou Special District, only five currently offer chemistry courses, and all already have chemistry teachers. However, the Commissioner's Office of Culture and Education still requested chemistry teachers from the Hebei Provincial Department of Education. When I asked the Commissioner's Office of Culture and Education on what basis they requested people from the province, their reply was based on "estimated figures." We asked why chemistry teachers were assigned to schools that did not need chemistry teachers? The reply was: "They can teach chemistry next year."

    I believe that the Zhangjiakou Commissioner's Office of Culture and Education's practice of blindly increasing the number of physics and chemistry teachers without regard to actual needs is incorrect. I hope that the Hebei Provincial Personnel Department will conduct an in-depth investigation into this matter and find ways to correct it.

### 张家口专署文教科  不应盲目增加理化师资

专栏：读者来信摘要

     张家口专署文教科
     不应盲目增加理化师资
    河北省师范专科学校毕业生张玉琳来信：河北省教育厅分配我们今年毕业的同学十一人到张家口专区作初中理化教师。但是张家口专区并不需要这样多的理化教师，结果十一人中有六人改教了语文、教育、美术、体育或音乐。另外一个同学先被分配到蔚县中学去教化学，因该校没有化学课程，又被调到柴沟堡师范去，而柴沟堡师范原来的化学教师却因此被调到蔚县中学去教生理卫生。我原来被分配到阳泉中学去教化学，也因为该校没有化学课程而没去。
    据我们了解，张家口专区二十所中学中，现在只有五所设置化学课程，并且都已有了化学教师；可是专署文教科却还向河北省教育厅要化学教师。当我问专署文教科根据什么向省教育厅要人时，他们的答复是根据“估计数字”。我们问为什么要给不需要化学教员的学校分配化学教师？答复是：明年可以教化学。
    我认为，张家口专署文教科不按实际需要，盲目增加理化师资的做法，是不对的，希望河北省人事厅深入调查这件事，并设法加以纠正。
