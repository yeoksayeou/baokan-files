Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, October 22nd: The furnace baking at the newly built seamless steel tube plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is progressing well. Since the furnace baking began on the 20th, technicians have been using instruments to test the furnace body temperature every fifteen minutes. Heating workers are adding firewood to the furnace as needed, and Soviet experts are also providing guidance at the furnace side throughout the day. Since the ignition and furnace baking, the furnace body temperature has been rising evenly. By noon on the 21st, workers skillfully controlled the temperature at a certain level, according to the needs of the furnace baking work. In this way, the moisture in the furnace wall can slowly evaporate, so that the furnace wall will not be damaged by sudden expansion due to a sharp increase in temperature. After the furnace wall has been dried for more than ten hours, the furnace temperature will continue to rise evenly. When it reaches a certain temperature, gas will be sent into the furnace to prepare for hot rolling tests.

Currently, gas technicians are preparing for a gas explosion test (i.e., testing whether the gas is pure) to prevent accidents when releasing the gas. Relevant units are also making thorough preparations. The gas release will be the most tense moment of the furnace baking work.

According to Xinhua News Agency: The Committee of the Rolling Mill Engineering Company of the Chinese Communist Party Anshan Iron and Steel Company is strengthening political work at the construction site during the completion phase of the seamless steel tube plant to ensure the quality of the project and the smooth progress of handover and acceptance work.

During the completion phase of the seamless steel tube plant, the largest workload involves complex adjustment and test runs, with strict quality requirements. The completion time for various finishing projects is urgent, and various types of work need to be more closely coordinated. Moreover, the number of units has increased, the number of personnel has decreased, and it is in a transition period between new and old work, making it easy for workers' thinking to fluctuate. For example, some workers are "reluctant" to hand over the completed factory to production workers; some want to stay and become production workers; and some believe that the project is nearing completion, and everything will be fine, so they work very actively, but neglect quality and safety. These characteristics of the completion phase all require further strengthening of the Party's political work on the construction site.

In light of these circumstances, the Committee of the Rolling Mill Engineering Company of the Chinese Communist Party has further strengthened political work at the construction site and conducted in-depth ideological education for all employees. First, they adopted various methods to vigorously promote to the workers the great political and economic significance of the early completion of the seamless steel tube plant, whose contribution to the country cannot be estimated by numbers. It will inspire all employees to launch a production increase and economy practice during the completion phase. Secondly, they explained to the workers that the construction of the seamless steel tube plant was due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the strong support of the people of the whole country, the selfless labor of all employees, and especially the sincere and selfless assistance of Soviet experts, telling them that basic construction workers alone could not complete this huge engineering task. At the same time, they explained to the workers that the country's construction is a "century-long plan," and that the purpose of construction is for production, thereby calling on all employees to be responsible for the quality of the project to the end, and to overcome the unwillingness to hand over to production workers and the "reluctance" mentality. These publicity and education efforts have greatly boosted the morale of the workers and powerfully promoted the smooth progress of the handover and acceptance work and the finishing projects.

In strengthening political and ideological work, the Party Committee of the Rolling Mill Engineering Company also particularly strengthened security and safety work during the completion phase. First, they unified the security forces of basic construction and production units, explained to them the importance of security work during the completion phase, and established a safety responsibility system for areas or equipment operations. Secondly, they urged the administrative security departments to establish more than a dozen systems related to security, guaranteeing safety from an organizational standpoint. Currently, the handover and acceptance work of the seamless steel tube plant is progressing smoothly. (Attached photo)

    鞍钢无缝钢管厂加热炉烘炉的情况很好
    竣工时期的工地政治工作正进一步加强
    【新华社鞍山二十二日电】鞍山钢铁公司新建无缝钢管厂加热炉烘炉情况很好。加热炉从二十日开始烘炉后，技术人员们每隔十五分钟就用仪表测试一次炉体温度，加热工人们适时地往炉内添加木柴，苏联专家也整天在炉旁指导。自点火烘炉以来，炉体温度一直在均匀地上升着。到二十一日中午，工人们根据烘炉工作的需要，巧妙地把温度控制在一定的度数上，这样，炉壁内的水分可以慢慢蒸发，使炉壁不会因温度急剧增高而突然膨胀受到损坏。等到经过十多小时炉壁干燥以后，炉温将继续均匀地提高，到一定温度时，就要往炉内放送瓦斯准备热试轧了。
    现在，燃气技术人员正在准备瓦斯爆炸试验（即试验瓦斯是否纯），防止放瓦斯时发生事故；有关单位也正进行周密的准备。放瓦斯将是烘炉工作中最紧张的一刻。
    据新华社讯：中共鞍山钢铁公司轧钢工程公司委员会加强无缝钢管厂竣工时期的工地政治工作，保证工程质量和移交验收工作的顺利进行。
    无缝钢管厂竣工时期的工作中，最大量的是复杂的调整试车工作，质量要求很严格；各项结束工程完成时间急迫，各工种需要配合得更加紧密；而且单位增多，人员减少，处于新旧工作交接期间，职工思想容易波动。如部分工人“舍不得”把建成的工厂移交给生产工人；有的要求留下来当生产工人；有的则认为工程快要完工了，一切都不会有问题，因此干的很积极，但却忽视质量和安全。竣工时期的这些特点，都要求工地上进一步加强党的政治工作。
    中共轧钢工程公司委员会根据这些情况，就进一步加强了工地政治工作，向全体职工进行了深入的思想教育。首先，他们采取各种方式，向职工们大力宣传无缝钢管厂的提前竣工，在政治上和经济上的重大意义，对国家的贡献是不能用数字来估量的。它将鼓舞全体职工开展竣工时期的增产节约竞赛。其次，向职工们说明无缝钢管厂的建成，是由于中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导、全国人民的大力支援、全体职工的忘我劳动、特别是苏联专家真诚无私的帮助的道理，告诉他们单单是基本建设工人是完成不了这个巨大的工程任务的。同时向职工们说明，国家的建设是
    “百年大计”，建设的目的就是为了生产的道理，以此号召全体职工对工程质量负责到底，克服不愿意交给生产工人和“舍不得”的思想。这些宣传教育大大地鼓舞了职工们的情绪，有力地推动了移交验收工作和收尾工程的顺利进行。
    中共轧钢工程公司党委在加强政治思想工作中，还特别加强了竣工时期的保卫和安全工作。他们首先统一了基本建设和生产单位保卫和保安力量，向他们说明竣工时期保卫、保安工作的重要性，并建立了区域或设备运转的安全专责制。其次，他们督促行政保卫部门建立了十几种有关保卫、保安方面的制度，从组织制度上来保证安全。现在，无缝钢管厂的移交验收工作正在顺利进行中。（附图片）
