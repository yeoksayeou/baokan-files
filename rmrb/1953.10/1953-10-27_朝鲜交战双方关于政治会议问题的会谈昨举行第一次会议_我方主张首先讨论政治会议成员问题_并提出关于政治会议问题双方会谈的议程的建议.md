(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 26th) The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference issued a communique as follows:

The first meeting of the talks between the Korean warring parties on the issue of the political conference was held at Panmunjom at 11:00 AM on October 26, 1953. Representing the Korean-Chinese side at this meeting were Mr. Ki Sok-bok, Plenipotentiary Representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Mr. Huang Hua, Plenipotentiary Representative of the People's Republic of China. Representing the other side at this meeting was Mr. Arthur Dean, Representative of the United States.

At the first meeting, Mr. Ki Sok-bok, Representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, spoke first, reiterating the consistent position of the governments of Korea and China that other relevant neutral countries, especially Asian neutral countries, should participate in the conference in addition to the Korean warring parties. He pointed out that according to the notifications from the governments of Korea and China to the US government on October 10 and October 19, 1953, the task of the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference is mainly and primarily to discuss and resolve the issue of the membership of neutral countries participating in the political conference, and secondly to discuss and resolve the issues of the time and place of the conference, as well as various procedural, administrative, and arrangement-related issues. Finally, Representative Ki Sok-bok, based on the unanimous opinion of the governments of Korea and China, put forward suggestions regarding the agenda of the bilateral talks. The full text of Representative Ki Sok-bok's speech is as follows:

The realization of the Korean armistice has brought comfort and hope to the people of the world. Countries and governments yearning for peace regard this as an important step towards promoting world peace and international security and express warm welcome. They demand that this significant step continue to move forward, leading to the establishment of lasting and consolidated peace in Korea and the Far East. They express deep concern about its future development, especially harboring great expectations and hopes for the political conference stipulated in the Korean Armistice Agreement. It is clear that the relevant governments of the Korean warring parties should not disappoint this deep desire for peace among the people of the world.

The basic position of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the government of the People's Republic of China on the political conference has been clearly stated in the previous statements of our two governments.  The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the government of the People's Republic are prepared to make every effort and take all effective measures to promote the rapid and successful convening of the political conference and achieve positive results. This is the unwavering belief of the people of Korea and China, and it is what peace-loving people and governments all over the world desire and support.

The fact that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the government of the People's Republic of China have sent us to conduct bilateral talks with the US representative on the issue of the political conference is another effort by the governments of Korea and China to ensure that the political conference can be convened quickly and smoothly. This meeting is being conducted on the basis of equal treatment between the relevant governments of the Korean warring parties. We believe that in this meeting, all issues should be resolved through consultation; all issues that must be discussed and resolved in order to smoothly convene the political conference should be discussed and resolved in this meeting, and nothing should be excluded.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and The government of the People's Republic of China have consistently believed that the political conference should not be limited to the Korean warring parties alone, but should include other relevant neutral countries, especially Asian neutral countries. This is not only because the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and other issues is related to the interests of many other countries in the world, especially neutral Asian countries, which are keenly concerned about the success of the political conference; but also because only with the participation of other relevant neutral countries besides the Korean warring parties can the political conference proceed smoothly and rationally resolve issues such as the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

According to the notifications from the governments of Korea and China to the US government on October 10 and October 19, 1953, this meeting may include the issues of the location and time of the political conference and various procedural, administrative, and arrangement-related issues raised in the US government's notification; however, this meeting should focus more on resolving the issue of the membership of the political conference. Therefore, we believe that the current task of the talks on the political conference is mainly and primarily to discuss and resolve the issue of the membership of neutral countries participating in the political conference, and secondly to discuss and resolve the issues of the time and place of the conference, as well as various procedural, administrative, and arrangement-related issues.

I now, based on the unanimous opinion of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the government of the People's Republic of China, suggest the following agenda for the bilateral talks:

One, the issue of the membership of the political conference.

Two, the issue of the time and place of the political conference.

Three, the procedural issues of the political conference.

Four, the administrative issues of the political conference.

Five, the financial issues of the political conference.

We believe that all these issues should and can be resolved through sincere consultation between the two sides to reach a consensus step by step. We suggest that we adopt the above agenda proposed by our side and immediately begin discussing the issue of the membership of the political conference in order to successfully conclude this meeting and enable the political conference to be convened in the shortest possible time.

Mr. Arthur Dean, the US representative, then spoke, explaining that the purpose of participating in this meeting was to resolve the preliminary administrative issues of the political conference, suggesting that the political conference be convened within four weeks, and reiterated the three locations previously suggested by the United States for convening the political conference. Finally, he suggested that the agenda for the bilateral talks be: (1) the location of the political conference; (2) the time of the political conference; (3) procedural and administrative matters, including sharing expenses; (4) other issues.

Finally, Mr. Huang Hua, representative of the People's Republic of China, spoke, expressing full agreement with and support for the speech of Mr. Ki Sok-bok, representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the suggestions regarding the agenda of the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference. Representative Huang Hua reiterated the consistent position of the governments of Korea and China on the issue of political conference membership, and pointed out that in order for the political conference to accomplish its important task, it is first necessary for both sides to negotiate and determine a reasonable and sound composition of the conference; therefore, the resolution of the issue of political conference membership must be the main task of these bilateral talks. Representative Huang Hua pointed out that the agenda for the bilateral talks suggested by the Korean-Chinese side already included the four agenda items suggested by the US representative, and therefore suggested that both sides immediately adopt the agenda for the bilateral talks proposed by the Korean-Chinese side. The full text of Representative Huang Hua's speech is as follows:

As the representative of the government of the People's Republic of China attending the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference, I fully agree with and support the speech of Mr. Ki Sok-bok, representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the suggestions regarding the agenda of the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference.

After the realization of the Korean armistice, the convening of a higher-level political conference is of great significance. This political conference not only bears the important task of realizing genuine peace in Korea, but its success or failure is closely related to the peace of the entire Far East and the world. The success of the political conference will establish a model for the peaceful negotiation and resolution of international disputes and create conditions for maintaining and consolidating world peace. Peace-loving people all over the world place great expectations on this political conference.

In order for the political conference to successfully complete this important task, it is first necessary for both sides to negotiate and determine a reasonable and sound composition of the conference. The governments of Korea and China have consistently believed that the political conference should include relevant neutral countries other than the Korean warring parties, especially Asian neutral countries. Only with the participation of relevant neutral countries can it be ensured that the conference can proceed in a harmonious atmosphere, thereby enabling the conference to successfully achieve positive results. Since the task of the political conference is not purely military in nature but is closely related to the peace of the entire Far East and the world, the members of the political conference cannot be limited to the Korean warring parties alone, but must include relevant neutral countries other than the warring parties. Only with the participation of neutral countries that are closely concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue can it be ensured that the political conference can complete its task of broad international significance and realize the expectations given by peace-loving people around the world.

Whether the members of the political conference can be determined on a reasonable and sound basis is related to the success or failure of the political conference. The resolution of the issue of political conference membership must be considered the main task of these bilateral talks. The Korean-Chinese representatives firmly maintain that the bilateral talks must first discuss and resolve this main issue of the membership of the political conference, and then resolve the issues of the time and place of the political conference, as well as various procedural, administrative, and arrangement-related issues.

In order for the political conference to be convened quickly, we suggest that both sides immediately adopt the agenda for the bilateral talks proposed by the Korean-Chinese side and immediately enter into substantive discussions on the issue of political conference membership.

The agenda for the bilateral talks suggested by the Korean-Chinese side already includes the four suggestions suggested by the US representative.

At the suggestion of the US representative, the meeting was temporarily adjourned until 11:00 AM on October 27.

    朝鲜交战双方关于政治会议问题的会谈昨举行第一次会议
    我方主张首先讨论政治会议成员问题
    并提出关于政治会议问题双方会谈的议程的建议
    【新华社开城二十六日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    朝鲜交战双方关于政治会议问题的会谈于一九五三年十月二十六日上午十一时在板门店举行第一次会议，代表朝中方面出席这一会谈的是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国全权代表奇石福先生与中华人民共和国全权代表黄华先生，代表对方出席这一会谈的是美国代表阿瑟·迪安先生。
    在第一次会议上，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表奇石福先生首先发言，重申朝中两国政府一贯坚持的应有除朝鲜交战双方以外的其他有关中立国家，特别是亚洲中立国家参加会议的立场，并指出根据朝中两国政府于一九五三年十月十日、十月十九日两次答复美国政府的通知，双方关于政治会议问题会谈的任务主要并首先是讨论和解决中立国参加政治会议的成员问题，其次是讨论和解决会议的时间、地点问题，以及有关程序的行政的以及安排方面的各项问题。最后奇石福代表根据朝中两国政府的一致意见提出关于双方会谈议程的建议。奇石福代表的发言全文如下：
    朝鲜停战的实现给世界人民带来了安慰和希望，渴望着和平的各国人民和政府认为这是有关增进世界和平和国际安全的重要的一步而表示热烈的欢迎。他们要求这意义重大的一步继续不断地前进，一直引导到确立朝鲜和远东持久和巩固的和平。他们对它的今后发展表示深切的关心，尤其是对于在朝鲜停战协定中所规定的政治会议怀抱着很大的期待和嘱望。很显然，朝鲜交战双方有关各国政府不应该使世界人民的这个深切的和平要求落空。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府对于政治会议的基本立场，已经在我们两国政府的历次声明中作了明白的表示。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府准备竭尽努力，采取一切有效措施来促进政治会议的迅速而圆满的召开，并得到积极的结果。这是朝中两国人民不可动摇的信念，这是全世界爱好和平的人民和政府所渴望和支持的。
    此次朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府派遣我们来与美国代表进行关于政治会议的双方会谈，正是朝中两国政府为了保证政治会议能够迅速和顺利地召开的又一次努力。这一个会谈是朝鲜交战双方有关政府在平等对待的基础上进行的。我们认为：在这个会谈中，一切问题都应经过协商求得解决；一切为了顺利召开政治会议所必须讨论和解决的问题，都应在此次会谈中加以讨论和解决，而不应该有所排除。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府一贯认为：政治会议不应该仅限于朝鲜交战双方，而应该有除朝鲜交战双方以外的其他有关中立国家，特别是亚洲中立国家参加。这不仅是因为朝鲜问题等问题的和平解决，关系着世界上众多的其他国家特别是亚洲中立国家的利益，它们热烈地关心着政治会议的成功；而且因为只有在除朝鲜交战双方以外其他有关中立国家参加的情况下，政治会议才能顺利进行，以合理解决从朝鲜撤退外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题等问题。
    根据朝中两国政府于一九五三年十月十日、十月十九日两次答复美国政府的通知，这一会谈可以包括美国政府通知中所提出的解决政治会议的地点和时间问题以及有关程序的、行政管理的和安排方面的各项问题；但在这一会谈中，更主要的还是应当解决政治会议的成员问题。因此，我们认为：目前关于政治会议的会谈的任务，主要并首先是讨论和解决中立国参加政治会议的成员问题，其次是讨论和解决会议的时间、地点问题以及有关程序的、行政的以及安排方面的各项问题。
    我现在根据朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府与中华人民共和国政府的一致意见，建议双方会谈的议程如下：
    一、政治会议的成员问题。
    二、政治会议的时间和地点问题。
    三、政治会议的程序问题。
    四、政治会议的行政问题。
    五、政治会议的经费问题。
    我们相信所有这些问题都是应该而且可以经过双方诚意的协商循序达到一致的协议的。我们建议通过我方上述的议程，并立即开始关于政治会议的成员问题的讨论，以便顺利结束此次会谈，使政治会议得在可能最短的期间内召开。
    美国代表阿瑟·迪安先生接着发言，说明参加这一会谈的目的是解决政治会议的初步行政问题，建议政治会议在四星期内召开，并再次提出美国过去建议的召开政治会议的三个地点，末了，他建议双方会谈的议程为：（1）政治会议的地点；（2）政治会议的时间；（3）程序及行政事项包括分担费用；（4）其他问题。
    最后，中华人民共和国代表黄华先生发言，表示完全同意和支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表奇石福先生的发言和关于政治会议问题双方会谈的议程的建议。黄华代表重申朝中两国政府对于政治会议成员问题的一贯主张，并指出，为使政治会议完成其重大的任务，首先就必须由双方协商确定会议的合理与健全的组成；因此，政治会议成员问题的解决必须是这次双方会谈的主要任务。黄华代表指出，朝中方面的代表所建议的双方会谈议程已包括了美国代表所建议的四点议程，因此建议双方立即通过朝中方面所提出的双方会谈的议程。黄华代表的发言全文如下：
    作为出席关于政治会议问题的双方会谈的中华人民共和国政府的代表，我完全同意和支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表奇石福先生的发言和关于政治会议问题双方会谈的议程的建议。
    朝鲜停战实现后，高一级政治会议的召开是具有重大的意义的。这一政治会议，不仅负有实现朝鲜的真正的和平的重要任务，而且它的成败密切关系着整个远东和世界的和平。政治会议的成功，将为和平协商解决国际争端建立范例，为维持与巩固世界和平创造条件。全世界爱好和平的人民，对于这一政治会议，都寄托着巨大的期望。
    为使政治会议得以圆满地完成这重大的任务，首先就必须由双方协商确定会议的合理与健全的组成。朝中两国政府一贯认为政治会议应有朝鲜交战双方以外的有关中立国家，特别是亚洲中立国家参加。只有在有关中立国家参加的情况下，才能保证会议能以在和谐的气氛下进行，从而使会议能顺利地获致积极的结果。政治会议的任务既然并非纯军事性质而是密切关联着整个远东与世界和平，因此政治会议的成员也就不可能限于朝鲜的交战双方，而必须包括交战双方以外的有关中立国家。也只有在密切关心朝鲜问题的和平解决的中立国家参加的情况之下，才能保证政治会议能以完成其具有广泛国际意义的任务，使世界爱好和平的人民所赋予的期望得以实现。
    政治会议的成员是否能在合理与健全的基础上予以确定，关系着政治会议的成败。政治会议成员问题的解决，必须被认为是这次双方会谈中主要的任务。朝中代表坚决主张：双方会谈必须首先讨论与解决政治会议的成员的这一主要问题，然后解决政治会议的时间和地点问题以及有关程序、行政和安排方面的问题。
    为了使政治会议得以迅速召开，我们建议双方立即通过朝中方面所提出的双方会谈的议程，并立即进入有关政治会议成员问题的实质的讨论。
    朝中方面的代表所建议的双方会谈议程已包括了美国代表所建议的四点建议。
    会议在美国代表提议之下暂时休会至十月二十七日上午十一时。
