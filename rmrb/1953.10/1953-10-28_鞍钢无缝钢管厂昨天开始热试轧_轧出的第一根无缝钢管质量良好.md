Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, October 27th: The first seamless steel tube in Chinese history was born in the steel capital of Anshan yesterday afternoon, October 27th. The seamless steel tube plant has begun hot trial rolling.

The hot trial rolling was carried out after thorough preparation and in accordance with strict operating procedures. The general commander of the hot trial rolling was the factory director and the head of the Soviet expert team assisting the factory's production. Before the hot trial rolling began, a general operation was conducted throughout the morning, and the situation was very good.

The hot trial rolling began at 2:30 PM. The workers took their respective positions. They were full of confidence but also worried about this first attempt. As the hands of the clock moved forward, people's anticipation grew increasingly tense.

At 2:30, the whistle signaling the hot trial rolling sounded. A red-hot steel billet emerged from the 1200-degree high-temperature heating furnace and quickly passed through the piercing mill. When the fiery red head of the steel tube just appeared in the piercing mill, people cheered, "It's out! It's out!" The steel tube was out, and everyone present warmly applauded and cheered to celebrate this historical moment for China's seamless steel tube rolling plant. They decided to dedicate the first seamless steel tube to Chairman Mao.

The tense and expectant mood of everyone suddenly turned into the pride and laughter of soldiers after a victory. The steel tube, carrying sparks, smoothly passed through the tube rolling mill, followed by another round of applause and cheers. The applause and cheers continued until the first steel tube reached the last process. At this moment, a Soviet expert immediately shook hands with the Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the managers who were present to observe, and congratulated them, saying: "From today onwards, New China has its own seamless steel tubes!" He then said to the workers present: "This is built by you!" The Municipal Committee Secretary gratefully said: "This is the result of the assistance of the Soviet government and Soviet experts. We thank the Soviet government and Soviet experts for their sincere assistance!" The Soviet expert humbly stated: This is the crystallization of Sino-Soviet friendship.

Gu Fengfu, a young worker who had studied seamless steel tube rolling in the Soviet Union, excitedly said: I will write a letter immediately to report the good news to the Soviet teacher who taught us the technology. Another worker said: I will also go home and tell the farmers in my hometown: their support, along with that of the people of the whole country, has not been in vain.

The first seamless steel tube rolled out today is of good quality. Soviet experts and technical inspectors, using precision instruments, proved that the diameter and thickness of the steel tube meet the specifications. The trial rolling ended at a little after 4 PM.

At 4:30 PM, Soviet experts walked out of the factory building. Workers involved in basic construction and production, with infinite gratitude, crowded around the Soviet experts, applauding, cheering, and shaking hands to congratulate them. Female workers also presented flowers to the experts on behalf of all the workers. In the evening, various engineering companies of Anshan Iron and Steel jointly hosted a banquet to celebrate the Soviet experts who participated in the construction of the seamless steel tube plant.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, October 27th: The heart of the seamless steel tube plant—the general trial run of the factory's largest and most complex six major units (piercing, rolling, sizing, equalizing, etc.)—successfully concluded on the afternoon of the 26th. All work is now ready, and hot trial rolling can begin.

On the morning of the 26th, staff from the basic construction and production departments, along with Soviet experts, braved the heavy rain and went to work early. After repeated inspections of various machines and equipment after 8:00 AM, the general trial run was conducted. Soviet experts and staff concentrated on the operation of the machines next to each basic equipment, constantly adjusting the equipment components. The total trial run lasted more than six hours, and the operation was in good condition. At the end of the trial run, the construction workers handed over the six major unit equipment to the production department. The responsible personnel from both the basic construction and production departments signed the handover documents.

Since igniting and sealing the furnace on the 20th, and transmitting gas on the 24th, the furnace temperature has been normal, maintained at around 1,000 degrees. The first batch of tube blanks was put into the heating furnace on the 26th and will soon be available for hot trial rolling.

    鞍钢无缝钢管厂昨天开始热试轧
    轧出的第一根无缝钢管质量良好
    【新华社鞍山二十七日电】二十七日下午，中国历史上第一根无缝钢管在钢都鞍山诞生了，无缝钢管厂开始了热试轧。
    热试轧是经过充分的准备和按照严格的操作规程进行的。热试轧总指挥是厂长和帮助该厂生产的苏联专家组长。在热试轧开始之前，经过一个上午的总运转，情况很好。
    下午二时半开始热试轧。工人们走上各自的岗位。他们充满着信心，又怀着初次试尝的担心。时针向前转动着，人们盼望的心情越来越紧张了。
    两点半，命令热试轧的汽笛响了，通红的钢坯从一千二百度的高温加热炉里吐出来，迅速钻过了穿孔机。穿孔机里刚刚露出火红的钢管头时，人们就欢呼着“出来了！出来了！”钢管出来了，所有在场的人们都为这新中国轧制无缝钢管厂的历史时刻，热烈鼓掌，欢呼祝贺。他们决定要把第一根无缝钢管献给毛主席。
    原来每一个人紧张期待的心情，这时立刻变得像战士们打了胜仗时那样得意、欢笑。钢管带着火花又顺利地通过了轧管机，又是一阵掌声和欢呼，掌声和欢呼一直把第一根钢管送到最后一个工序。这时，一位苏联专家立即向在场参观的中共鞍山市委会书记和经理们握手祝贺说：“新中国从今天起就有了自己的无缝钢管了！”他又向着在场的工人说：“这是你们建设的！”市委书记感激地说：“这是苏联政府和苏联专家帮助的成果，我们感谢苏联政府和苏联专家对我们的真诚援助！”苏联专家谦逊地表示：这是中苏友谊的结晶。
    一个曾到苏联学习轧制无缝钢管的青年工人顾凤富兴奋地说：我回去马上写信向教给我们技术的苏联老师报喜。另一个工人说：我回家去也要告诉乡里的农民：他们和全国人民没有白白地支援我们。
    今天轧出的第一根无缝钢管质量良好。苏联专家和技术检查人员用精密的仪器检查证明，钢管的口径和厚度都合乎规格。试轧进行到下午四点多钟结束。
    下午四点半，苏联专家从厂房里走出来，从事基本建设和生产的工人们以无限感激的心情拥向苏联专家，鼓掌欢呼，握手祝贺。女工们并代表全体工人向专家献花。晚上鞍钢各工程公司联合欢宴参加建设无缝钢管厂的苏联专家。
    【新华社鞍山二十七日电】无缝钢管厂生产的心脏——全厂最大最复杂的六大机组（穿孔、轧管、定径、均整等）设备总试车已在二十六日下午胜利结束，一切工作业已准备就绪，热试轧即可开始。
    二十六日清晨，基本建设、生产部门的职工们和苏联专家们，冒着大雨提前上班。八点多钟，各个机器设备经过反复检查后，即进行总试车。苏联专家和职工们都在各基础设备旁边聚精会神地注视着机器的运转，并不时地调整着设备部件。总试车共六个多小时，运转情况良好。在试车结束时，建厂职工们把六大机组设备移交生产部门，基本建设与生产部门双方负责人员在交接单上签字。
    从二十日点火封炉，二十四日放送瓦斯以来，炉温正常，保持在一千度左右。第一批管坯在二十六日投入加热炉，很快就可供给热试轧的需要。
