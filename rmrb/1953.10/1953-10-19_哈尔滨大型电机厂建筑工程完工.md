Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 17th: The construction of the large electric motor plant of the state-owned Harbin Electric Motor Plant—China's first large-scale electric motor manufacturing plant—was completed on October 16th, 58 working days ahead of the schedule stipulated in the contract. This large electric motor plant will produce various large electric motors urgently needed for China's construction, including 10,000 kW and 16,000 kW hydroelectric generators. According to the plan, partial production can begin in August or September next year. The victorious completion of the construction project is great news for the people of the whole country.
    The construction area of the large electric motor plant is more than 24,500 square meters, and the metal structure weighs more than 3,000 tons. The metal structure project includes 1.63 million drilled holes and 554,000 rivets. The civil construction project includes 100,000 blocks of foam concrete and 25,000 reinforced concrete roof panels, all with strict quality specifications. Such a large and complex construction project, from surveying and design to construction, was undertaken entirely by Chinese engineers, technicians, and workers. Furthermore, the employees of the First Engineering Company and the Riveting and Welding Factory of the Central Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration, who contracted for this project, had never undertaken such a large project before. Therefore, the victorious completion of the construction of the large electric motor plant also proves the rapid growth of China's technical strength. In the past, the workers at the construction site of the large electric motor plant had carefully accumulated some experience in undertaking projects such as the Harbin Electric Motor Plant medium-sized electric motor plant. This year, they have continuously and humbly learned from advanced Soviet experience. In construction, whenever they encountered work they had never done before, they would first try one piece, draw conclusions from it, and then promote it universally. As a result, experience was constantly accumulated and the technical level improved rapidly.
    The completion of the construction of the large electric motor plant also illustrates the significant role of the local Party committee of the Chinese Communist Party in ensuring the smooth construction of key national projects. For example, before the project started in March this year, the construction unit and the construction unit had ideas of shirking responsibility and relying on each other, resulting in insufficient preparation of steel, which risked delaying the start of construction. At this time, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee specially sent a working group to check, and the Harbin Municipal Committee of the CPC also held a special meeting to study the matter, and finally effectively solved the problem of insufficient steel preparation, ensuring the start of construction on schedule. Before the start of construction, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the CPC also consulted with the local government and decided to allocate the best quality red bricks produced by the local brick factory to the construction site of the large electric motor plant first. After the start of construction, in addition to assisting in supervising and urging the supply departments of rivets, steel windows, plumbing equipment, etc. to guarantee supply, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the CPC also discovered in the inspection that the steel had not been tested, so it helped to invite Soviet experts to conduct identification and made remedies. In addition, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the CPC also sent working groups to help in implementing the responsibility system, strengthening planning management, and promoting advanced experience. The solution of these key problems is a favorable condition for the successful completion of the construction of the large electric motor plant.

### 哈尔滨大型电机厂建筑工程完工

    哈尔滨大型电机厂建筑工程完工
    【新华社哈尔滨十七日电】我国第一个规模巨大的电机制造厂——国营哈尔滨电机厂大型电机厂的建筑工程，已在十月十六日完工，实际工作日比包工合同规定的工作日减少了五十八天。这个大型电机厂将生产我国建设急需的各种大型电机，包括一万瓩、一万六千瓩的水轮发电机。按照计划，明年八九月间可以局部开始生产，建筑工程的胜利完工，是全国人民的大喜讯。
    大型电机厂建筑面积为两万四千五百多平方公尺，金属结构重达三千余吨。金属结构工程包括一百六十三万个钻眼和五十五万四千个铆钉。土木建筑工程包括十万块泡沫混凝土和两万五千块钢筋混凝土屋面板，质量规格要求都很严格。这样规模巨大而复杂的建筑工程，从勘察设计到施工全部都是我国工程技术人员和工人所担负。而承包这项工程的中央有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司和铆焊厂的职工又从未干过这样大的工程。因此，大型电机厂建筑工程的胜利完工，也同时证明我国技术力量的迅速成长。大型电机厂工地职工过去在承建哈尔滨电机厂中型电机厂等工程中，已经细心地积累了一些经验，今年又不断地虚心学习了苏联先进经验。他们在施工中凡遇到没有做过的工作，都先做一件试试，从中得出结论再普遍推行，因此经验不断积累，技术水平提高较快。
    大型电机厂建筑工程完工，还说明了中共地方党委保证国家重点工程顺利施工的重大作用。如今年三月这个工程开工前，因为建设单位和施工单位存在互相推诿依赖的思想，以致钢材准备不足，有延误开工的危险。这时，中共中央东北局专门派出工作组加以检查，中共哈尔滨市委员会也专门召开会议研究，终于有效地解决了钢材准备不足的问题，保证了按期开工。开工前，中共哈尔滨市委员会还商得地方政府同意，把当地制砖厂出产的质量最好的红砖首先拨给大型电机厂工地使用。开工后，中共哈尔滨市委员会除了协助督促铆钉、钢窗、水暖器材等供应部门保证供应外，还在检查中发现钢材未经化验，就又帮助邀请苏联专家进行鉴定，作了补救。此外，在贯彻责任制、加强计划管理、推广先进经验等方面，中共哈尔滨市委员会也曾派工作组帮助。这些关键问题的解决，是大型电机厂建筑工程胜利完成任务的有利条件。
