Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 6th: Zhang Mingshan, Deputy Director of the Small Rolling Mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, pioneer of mechanization and automation, national model worker, and the "Automation" group he leads, have put forward eleven more mechanization and automation suggestions in the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign.

The eleven suggestions put forward by Zhang Mingshan and his "Automation" group are all related to improving product output and quality and saving materials. Among these suggestions, the large ones include automatic bundling and conveying machines that require hundreds of man-hours to modify; the small ones include the modification of the "exit nozzle" used for rolling tube blanks. Now, Zhang Mingshan is leading his "Automation" group to manufacture four kinds of mechanized and automated equipment, such as cutting knives, straightening machines, grinding machines, and "counter-vertical retaining discs," based on the importance of each and according to existing manpower conditions.

In the past, the "guide plates" used for rolling steel in small rolling mills were only used once and then discarded. Now, the grinding machine that Zhang Mingshan and his group are manufacturing will grind the holes of the used small-sized "guide plates" to be larger, making them into larger-sized "guide plates" for use. In this way, one guide plate can be used four times. Even with such a small suggestion, it is estimated that it can save the country 70 million yuan of wealth from September to December. In the past, when small rolling mills produced small-sized wire rods, the rising and falling of the rotary cutter and the speed of the rolling mill in rolling the wire rods were often inconsistent, causing many small-sized wire rods to bend on the roller table. As a result, these wire rods had to be treated as waste products. The straightening machine that Zhang Mingshan and his "Automation" group are about to make will straighten the bent wire rods, and those that meet the length requirements will be used as finished wire rods, and those that do not meet the length requirements can also be used as building materials. In this way, the waste products caused by bending can be completely eliminated, creating favorable conditions for the factory to complete its production increase plan.

    鞍钢小型轧钢厂张明山“自动化”小组在增产节约运动中提出十一件机械化建议
    【新华社鞍山六日电】鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂副厂长、机械化自动化的首创者、全国劳动模范张明山和他领导的“自动化”小组，在增产节约运动中又提出了十一件机械化自动化建议。
    张明山和他的“自动化”小组提出的这十一件建议，都是和提高产品的产量、质量和节约材料有关的。在这些建议中，大的有需要几百个人工来改造的自动捆料和运料机；小的有改造轧制管坯用的
  “出口咀子”。现在，张明山正领导着他的“自动化”小组，分别主要次要和根据现有人力条件，先来制造剪断刀、矫正机、磨床和“反立围盘”等四种机械化自动化的设备。
    过去小型轧钢厂轧钢使用的“导板”，只用一次就不用了。现在，张明山和他的小组正在制造的磨床，就是把使用过的小规格“导板”的孔型再磨大一些，作成大规格的“导板”使用。这样，一个导板就能利用四次。只是这样一个很小的建议，估计从九月到十二月就可为国家节约七千万元的财富。过去，小型轧钢厂生产小规格线材时，往往因回转刀的起落和轧钢机轧制线材的速度不一致，使很多小规格线材都弯曲在辊道上，结果这些线材就只好当作废品来处理。张明山和他的“自动化”小组将要制成的矫正机，就是把弯曲的线材矫正好，合于长度的就当作线材成品用，不合于长度的也能当做建筑材料。这样就可以把因弯曲而造成的废品完全消灭，给该厂完成增产计划创造了有利条件。
