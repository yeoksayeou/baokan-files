Xinhua News Agency Report: Southwest China's major spring crops (rice, corn, sorghum, cotton, ramie, flue-cured tobacco, sugarcane, etc.) have been mostly harvested, and the vast majority of areas have seen increased production. Coupled with the fact that this year's wheat production in the Southwest region increased by 15% compared to last year, the region has basically completed its annual agricultural production increase task for the year. Currently, farmers across the region are actively engaged in autumn plowing and planting, striving for increased production of minor spring crops (wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, etc.) next year.

In the first year of implementing the country's First Five-Year Plan, the broad masses of farmers and rural work cadres in the Southwest made tremendous efforts on the agricultural production front, overcoming droughts and insect pests in some areas, thus winning a bumper harvest. Not only did the entire region see a general bumper harvest of both minor spring crops and major spring crops, major crops and secondary crops, but also the main production areas of various crops generally saw greater increases in production than general areas. Sichuan Province, which accounts for approximately two-thirds of the total grain output in the Southwest region, saw a 20% increase in wheat production this year compared to last year, and rice production increased significantly more than other provinces. The harvest of corn, sorghum, and other coarse grains was also unprecedented in recent years. Guizhou Province, the largest flue-cured tobacco producing area in the Southwest, saw a more than 59% increase in flue-cured tobacco production this year compared to last year. The unit area yield of sugarcane in Sichuan Province can also increase by 15% compared to last year. In addition, Guizhou and other provinces, which were originally grain-deficient areas, have had a good harvest this year that has not been seen for many years, and have surplus grain to export.

The Southwest is one of China's major grain-producing areas, with Sichuan Province alone accounting for nearly one-tenth of the country's total grain output. In the past few years, especially in the first half of this year, the Southwest has exported a large amount of grain. Southwest farmers, having obtained an autumn harvest, are currently enthusiastically paying agricultural taxes and continuing to sell grain to the state in exchange for means of production to expand reproduction.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 30th: Over 60 million mu of late rice in the Central-South region and nearly 2 million mu of ratooning rice retained along the Yangtze River are entering a tense harvest season. In Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other provinces where late rice matures earlier, most areas have harvested more than 60%, and individual areas have completed harvesting. Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, where late rice matures later, also began harvesting around Frost's Descent (October 24th) and are expected to complete harvesting by the end of November.

This year, following the bumper harvests of early rice and mid-season rice, the Central-South region has also achieved a bumper harvest of late rice and ratooning rice. According to estimates from relevant agencies of the Central-South Administrative Committee, the average yield of late rice in the entire region can increase by more than 5% compared to last year. Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, which account for more than half of the total late rice area in the region, can see an average increase of about 8% in late rice production this year compared to last year. The counties in the Dongting Lake Plain and Poyang Lake Plain, which are famous granaries in the country, generally produce about 500 jin of late rice per mu, an increase of more than 10% compared to last year. In rice-rich counties such as Liling County in Hunan Province, Xishui County in Hubei Province, and Pingxiang County in Jiangxi Province, the general yield of late rice per mu is 600-700 jin. The more than 4,000 mu of densely planted late rice at the Datong Lake State-owned Farm in Hunan Province yielded 50 to 100 jin more per mu than the local farmers. Counties in the Xiaogan Prefecture and Huanggang Prefecture of Hubei Province, where more ratooning rice is grown, have also generally obtained harvests that are more than 10% higher than last year.

During the late rice harvest, farmers in various parts of the Central-South region are responding to the state's call to increase production and conserve grain, advocating careful harvesting and threshing to ensure that every grain is returned home. Some mutual aid teams in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, have made reasonable divisions of labor and mobilized women and children in the team to pick up ears of grain and sweep threshing grounds. Some individual farmers in some places have also organized temporary harvest mutual aid teams. Farmers in various places are paying attention to changing the past habit of rough work and are harvesting as the crops ripen.

### 西南区完成今年农业增产任务  中南区六千多万亩晚稻丰收

    西南区完成今年农业增产任务
    中南区六千多万亩晚稻丰收
    据新华社讯：西南各地大春作物（水稻、玉米、高粱、棉花、青麻、烤烟、甘蔗等）已大部收割完毕，绝大部分地区都得到增产。加上今年西南区小麦比去年增产百分之十五，全区基本上完成了今年全年农业增产的任务。目前，全区农民正积极进行秋耕秋种，为争取明年小春作物（小麦、油菜、蚕豆等）增产而努力。
    在执行国家建设第一个五年计划的第一年，西南广大农民和农村工作干部在农业生产战线上作了极大的努力，战胜了部分地区的干旱和虫害，因而赢得了丰收。全区不但小春作物和大春作物、主要作物和次要作物普遍丰收，而且各种作物的主要产区普遍比一般地区增产较多。大约占西南全区粮食总产量三分之二的四川省，今年小麦比去年增产百分之二十，水稻增产大大超过其他各省，玉米、高粱等杂粮作物更是近几年来未有过的丰收。贵州省是西南最大的烤烟产区，今年该省烤烟比去年增产百分之五十九强。四川省甘蔗单位面积产量也可比去年增产百分之十五。此外，贵州等省原来是缺粮的地区，今年得到多年未有的好收成，有了余粮输出。
    西南是我国主要粮食产区之一，仅四川省的粮食产量就将近占全国粮食总产量的十分之一。在过去几年内，特别是今年上半年，西南曾有大批粮食输出。获得秋季丰收后的西南农民，目前除踊跃交纳农业税外，正继续把粮食卖给国家，换取生产资料，扩大再生产。
    【新华社武汉三十日电】中南区六千多万亩晚稻和长江两岸部分地区留蓄的近二百万亩再生稻，已进入紧张的收获季节。晚稻成熟较早的湖南、湖北、江西等省，大部地区已收割百分之六十以上，个别地区已收割完毕。晚稻成熟较晚的广东、广西两省，也在霜降（十月二十四日）前后开始收割，到十一月下旬可全部收割完毕。
    今年中南区继早稻、中稻丰收之后，晚稻和再生稻又告丰收。据中南行政委员会有关机关的估计，今年全区晚稻平均可比去年增产百分之五以上。占全区晚稻总面积一半以上的广东、广西两省，今年晚稻平均可比去年增产百分之八左右。全国著名的粮仓——洞庭湖滨平原和鄱阳湖滨平原各县，一般每亩晚稻产五百斤左右，比去年增产一成多。湖南省醴陵县、湖北省浠水县、江西省萍乡县等水稻丰产县，一般每亩晚稻收六七百斤。湖南省地方国营大通湖农场密植的四千多亩晚稻，每亩产量比当地农民多产了五十斤到一百斤。蓄再生稻较多的湖北省孝感专区和黄冈专区各县，一般也获得了比去年增产一成以上的收成。
    晚稻收割中，中南区各地农民响应国家增产节约粮食的号召，提倡细收细打，争取颗粒还家。江西省萍乡县有些互助组对劳动力作了合理分工，发动组内妇女、小孩拾禾穗、扫禾场。有些地方单干农民也组织了临时收割互助组。各地农民都注意改变过去作业粗糙的习惯，作到边熟边割。
