    Eradicating the Extravagant and Wasteful Habits After the Autumn Harvest
    In rural areas of East China, Central South China, and Southwest China, there are some long-standing bad customs: During the autumn harvest, every household must prepare elaborate meals and drinks to treat the hired laborers and relatives; after the autumn harvest, they must also stage operas to "repay the gods," eat lavish banquets, and burn paper to worship ghosts and gods. This wastes a lot of money and grain. These bad habits were formed in the old society. At that time, some landlords and rich peasants did this to win over and deceive the laboring peasants, so that they could exploit them more cruelly; some were rights that poor peasants and hired laborers fought for from landlords and rich peasants; some peasants themselves, because they saw no hope of developing production, only cared about enjoying the moment when they had a good harvest, not making plans for expanded reproduction; some households lacking labor had to do this in order to get help during the busy farming season. In the old society, this phenomenon was not surprising, and it could not be entirely criticized. However, we must educate the peasant masses to clearly recognize that under today's conditions, these habits have become a waste, and from all aspects, there is no need for them anymore. In fact, it is an obstacle to our development of production.
    Some peasants say: "After a good harvest, is it not okay to improve our lives after the autumn harvest?" On the basis of developing production, improving lives is naturally necessary. In fact, the lives of general rural areas are now improving year by year compared to the past. This normal improvement is completely reasonable and cannot be considered a waste. However, eating and drinking lavishly like this several times without any meaning will not really improve life, but will waste a lot of money and grain. Moreover, even in the process of gradually improving life, we must never forget to save, and we must use as much of our income as possible for expanding reproduction. Whoever does not do this will not be able to improve their lives year by year; if they unfortunately encounter disasters or illnesses, they may fall into poverty again.
    Some peasants say: "We are not afraid of poverty, after we have eaten and drank, the People's Government will not let us starve to death anyway." The government will naturally provide assistance to peasants who have difficulties in life and production due to unexpected disasters. However, it is unreasonable to ask the government for assistance for those who have fallen into difficulties because of extravagance and waste after a good harvest. Every patriotic peasant should strive to reduce the burden on the country so that the country can use more money for economic construction and lay a solid foundation for the greater happiness of the people of the whole country.
    Some peasants say: "Let's eat a little when we have a little, anyway, we will be in socialism in the future; at that time, everything will be public and will not belong to ourselves." This is an extremely wrong understanding of socialism. Socialism is by no means a matter of turning everything over to the public. Socialism will make the lives of every peasant many times better than they are now; the socialist system relies on people's labor to create happiness in life. Wasting the fruits of labor now is destroying or postponing future happy life. It can be seen that if we want socialism to be realized sooner, everyone must produce more actively and practice strict economy.
    The phenomenon of waste in some rural areas during and after the autumn harvest is nothing more than because feudal old habits and superstitious ideas have not been eliminated, and the production enthusiasm of some peasants is not yet stable. Therefore, the Party committees at all levels in various places should widely and deeply publicize the national construction guidelines and various economic policies to cadres and the masses in the current production and autumn grain purchase work, and establish the idea of long-term increasing production and practicing economy; through universal suffrage and development, rectify agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations, mobilize the masses to eliminate the bad habits of waste, and do everything possible to use more income to purchase means of production and expand reproduction. After the general election in Sukou Township, Jinzhai County, Anhui Province, the people's representatives proposed to change the old habit of eating "rice harvesting meals" and sell the saved grain to the state in exchange for fertilizer and cattle. This practice is very correct. This is a gratifying new atmosphere in the countryside brought about by democratic life, and it is a manifestation of the further improvement of the masses' awareness. Cadres at all levels in various places should use this method of mobilizing the masses to educate themselves to more effectively promote the movement of increasing production and practicing economy in rural areas.

### 破除秋收后铺张浪费的恶习

    破除秋收后铺张浪费的恶习
    华东、中南、西南许多地区的农村，有一些相沿已久的陋规：在秋收时，家家都要大办酒菜，请帮工的和亲邻们大吃大喝；在秋收后，也要唱戏“酬神”，大吃酒席，烧纸敬鬼敬神。这样，就浪费了大量的钱、粮。这些坏习惯都是在旧社会里形成的。在那时有的是地主富农为了笼络欺骗劳动农民、便于平时对他们进行更惨酷的剥削而做的；有的是贫雇农民向地主富农争得的权利；有的是农民自己因为看不到发展生产的希望，得到丰收就只顾片刻享受，落得一顿好的算一顿，不为扩大再生产作打算；有的是缺乏劳力的农户为了争取农忙时有人帮工不得不这样做。在旧社会里，这种现象是不足为怪的，也不能一概非难的。可是，我们必须教育农民群众认识清楚：在今天的条件下，这些习惯已经成了一种浪费，从各方面看再无什么需要，实际上是我们发展生产的一个障碍。
    有的农民说：“丰收了，在秋收后改善一下生活不行吗？”在发展生产的基础上，改善生活自然是应该的。实际上，一般农村的生活现在和过去相比已经是一年比一年有所改善了。这种正常的改善是完全合情合理的，不能算作浪费。可是，像这样毫无意义的大吃大喝几次，既不能真正改善生活，反而浪费了很多金钱和粮食。而且就是在逐步改善生活中，任何时候也不能忘记节约，要尽可能更多地把收入用到扩大再生产上去。谁不这样做，谁的生活就不可能年年提高；不幸遇上灾害疾病，还可能重复陷于贫困的境地。
    有的农民说：“不怕穷困，吃喝完了反正人民政府不会让我们饿死。”对于因为遭受意外灾害而在生活和生产上发生困难的农民，政府自然是要援助的。可是，由于丰收之后铺张浪费而使自己陷于困难的人，再要政府援助就不合情理了。每个爱国的农民，都应当力求减轻国家的负担，使国家能把更多的钱用于经济建设，为全国人民更大的幸福打下巩固的基础。
    有的农民说：“有一点就吃一点吧，反正将来就到社会主义了；那时候什么都是公家的，不归自己了。”这是对于社会主义的极其错误的认识。社会主义决不是什么都要归公。社会主义会使每个农民的生活都要比现在好多少倍；社会主义制度要依靠人们劳动来创造生活上的幸福，现在浪费了劳动所得，就是破坏了或推迟了将来的幸福生活。可见，要想社会主义早实现，就要每个人都更积极生产、厉行节约。
    秋收中和秋收后部分农村中所以会发生浪费的现象，无非是因为封建旧习、迷信思想未扫除和部分农民生产情绪还不稳定的缘故。因此，各地各级党委应当在当前的生产和秋征工作中向干部和群众广泛深入地宣传国家建设方针和各项经济政策，树立起长期增产节约的思想；通过普选和发展，整顿农业互助合作组织，发动群众革除浪费的恶习，尽一切可能把更多的收入用于购买生产资料，扩大再生产。安徽金寨县苏口乡普选后，人民代表倡议改变吃“割稻饭”的旧习惯，把节省下来的粮食卖给国家，换取肥料、耕牛，这种作法是非常正确的，这是民主生活带来的可喜的农村新气象，是群众觉悟进一步提高了的表现。各地各级干部都应当运用这种发动群众自己教育自己的方法，更有效地推动农村增产节约运动。
