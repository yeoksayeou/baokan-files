In the past four years, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, with the active support of local people's governments, the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, and the efforts of all staff and workers as well as the vast number of military, industrial, and civilian laborers, New China's transportation work has undergone various social reform movements and takeover, consolidation, and transformation efforts. We have basically completed the restoration phase of our transportation work and achieved some local development and considerable success.

    First, in terms of state-owned transportation production: Over the past four years, maritime transportation has been gradually reorganized and restored under difficult circumstances such as the blockade, "embargo," disruption, and sabotage by American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. We have formed our own maritime transport force, persisted in maritime transport, and gradually improved transportation efficiency. In 1952, state-owned ships completed 74% of the passenger and freight turnover in coastal transportation throughout the country. If the figure completed by state-owned coastal transportation in 1950 is taken as 100, the passenger turnover in 1952 has increased fourfold, and the freight turnover has increased elevenfold. The five major coastal ports ended local trusteeship in May of this year. The ships, ports, and ship repair in maritime transportation have been unified under the management of the Central Ministry of Communications. At the same time, the democratic reform of maritime transport enterprises and port stevedores has also been completed. These have formed the necessary conditions for organizing unified and integrated maritime transport. In addition, the implementation of ship schedule charts and the strengthening of the planning of ship dispatching, as well as the creation of new operating methods for the interconnection of ship terminals and warehouses in port operations, have resulted in considerable improvements in loading and unloading efficiency.

    Most of China's inland rivers do not freeze throughout the year, which gives them great advantages for transportation. At present, the navigable mileage is over 90,000 kilometers, of which about one-third is accessible to ships. In 1952, state-owned tugboats completed more than half of the passenger and freight turnover on inland rivers nationwide. The passenger and freight turnover of state-owned transportation in 1952 was also higher than in 1950. Taking 1950 as 100, the increase in 1952 was 177%. Over the years, inland river transportation has played a significant role in urban-rural exchange, coal and grain supply, and various major construction projects such as harnessing the Huai River, Jingjiang flood diversion, and other transportation tasks. In the first half of this year, the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau completed 123% of its plan for the first half of the year, exceeding its target. It has made considerable contributions to the transportation of Sichuan grain and is currently continuing its intense work. Since the introduction of the Soviet advanced experience—the tug-barge transportation method—the efficiency of inland river transportation has been significantly improved, and the successful trial voyage on the Sichuan River has created favorable conditions for further reducing costs and lowering freight rates. The Yangtze River has reduced freight rates three times since 1950, and after adjusting the freight rates for more than 100 kinds of goods, the average reduction is more than 30%.

    Automobile transportation was salvaged from the ruins left by the Kuomintang reactionary government. The vehicles were dilapidated and of complex brands. After reorganization and patching up after liberation, all operating vehicles have been restored and are now scattered in various provinces and cities for operation. By the end of 1952, the national operating mileage had reached more than 93,000 kilometers, and the scheduled bus mileage was more than 70,000 kilometers, which played an important role in short-distance transportation and local transportation. Since 1952, automobile transportation enterprises in various regions have launched the "Safety, Four Fixes, and Two Thousand Ton-Kilometers" campaign. Some of the original quota standards for fuel, lubricating oil, tires, repair mileage, and repair labor and materials have been broken, thereby reducing costs and freight rates. Taking gasoline vehicles as an example, the passenger transport rate in 1952 has been reduced by an average of 20% compared with 1951, and the freight rate has been reduced by 23%. The monthly output per ton of vehicles has generally approached the standard, and some provinces and regions have reached an output of 2,000 ton-kilometers per ton per month. There have also been many innovations in automobile transportation. For example, in Zhejiang Province this year, the vehicle repair mileage has increased by an average of four times compared with 1950. The highest record is that a vehicle can travel 117,000 kilometers after one repair, which is currently the highest mileage in the country.

    In 1952, the passenger and freight turnover completed by state-owned and local state-owned automobiles in various provinces nationwide increased by 126% in freight turnover and 65% in passenger turnover compared to 1950.

    Second, in terms of basic construction: Most of China's original highways were built by the Kuomintang reactionary government during the anti-communist and anti-people civil war and the Japanese imperialist invasion of China to meet its military requirements. When Chiang Kai-shek's army retreated, it destroyed most of the highways. After years of vigorous repair and reconstruction by the military and civilians after liberation, the restoration project has been completed, and key construction has begun. By the end of 1952, more than 9,700 kilometers of new and reconstructed highways had been completed. The total mileage of highways open to traffic nationwide has increased by 73% compared to 1949, and is now more than 130,000 kilometers, of which about half have reached the requirements for traffic in both sunny and rainy weather, and the driving speed has been increased. The regular maintenance mileage in various provinces has also increased from 75,000 kilometers in 1950 to more than 97,000 kilometers in 1952. For example, Anhui Province has implemented the road maintenance responsibility system and democratic management, and has created many new operating methods through planned production, self-examination, and red flag competitions, increasing construction efficiency by five times. The Northeast has created Zhao Yongxi's earthwork method, which has increased work efficiency by twice the highest record last year.

    In recent years, most of the new highway construction projects have been in border areas, and most of them have relied on the enthusiasm of the vast number of military, industrial, and civilian laborers to overcome various difficulties in construction under extremely harsh climatic and material conditions.

    Navigation construction was controlled by imperialism in old China and lacked a construction foundation. Therefore, after liberation, whether it was transportation equipment or engineering design, construction, and management, all work had to start from scratch. As of the end of 1952, we had added new ships; repaired old ships; salvaged sunken ships; built wharves; and basically restored the equipment and navigational aids in major coastal and Yangtze River ports; and completed the first phase of the reconstruction of Tanggu New Port and the expansion of Huangpu Port. The Sichuan River survey work was completed this year, and beacon construction and navigation mark reform work have been carried out on the Sichuan River and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, ensuring safe night navigation. Since there is no need to stop navigation at night between Yichang and Hankou, the navigation time has been shortened by about one-third, which can increase the ship turnover rate by 28%. Another preparatory work completed this year in navigation construction is the survey of more than 1,700 kilometers of the Grand Canal from north to south, which has provided some technical and economic data for future research on the Grand Canal's renovation plan.

    Third, in terms of private transportation: In the past four years, various private transportation industries have played a certain role in completing national transportation tasks under the leadership of state-owned transportation industries. In order to better leverage the potential of private shipping and complete national transportation tasks, we are carrying out rectification and reform work on the coastal and Yangtze River private shipping industries, and are implementing joint public-private ownership on the basis of complete voluntariness of the owners, so that private shipping gradually embarks on the path of state capitalism. Currently, the coastal private Zhongxing and Haiying shipping companies have implemented joint public-private ownership. In Shanghai, 34 private companies on the Yangtze River are organizing joint public-private ownership. The Chongqing Qianghua and Hezhong private companies have implemented joint public-private ownership in the first half of this year, and their business operations have improved, turning losses into profits. Since the implementation of joint public-private ownership of the Minsheng Company, after a series of rectification and reform work, the ship's deadweight has increased by 27%, and the construction and reconstruction of ships has been approximately 15,000 tons. The transportation volume has increased by more than one time the previous record, and the Sichuan River transportation cost has been reduced by more than 30%. The business has changed from the past loss situation to a surplus, and has initially demonstrated the superiority of joint public-private ownership.

    Fourth, in terms of mass transportation: Wooden sailboats, mule carts, and various folk transportation tools are distributed throughout the country, and there are many of them. They are a transportation army closely related to the lives of the broad masses of people. At present, there are approximately 4 million tons of wooden sailboats on inland rivers and coastal areas nationwide, and more than 200,000 animal-powered vehicles have been organized, and approximately 2 million can be organized. These transportation tools have played an important role in the past liberation war, urban and rural material exchanges, major construction projects, and urban infrastructure material transportation, and they will continue to play a significant role in a certain historical period in the future. In particular, inland river wooden sailboats undertake 46% of the inland river transportation turnover. This year, the democratic reform of wooden sailboats nationwide has been completed. Through the democratic reform movement, we have not only understood and grasped the basic situation of private ships, but also achieved significant political gains. At the same time, there have also been some improvements in navigation administration management and transportation operations. At present, grain transportation losses by wooden sailboats have been greatly reduced. Grain transportation losses in Changsha and Hengyang have been reduced from 18 per thousand in the past to 1 per thousand. Various regions have gained some experience in organizing and managing individual private wooden sailboats and animal-powered vehicle transportation, and have effectively cooperated with local production and construction work.

    According to existing statistics, the completion of the plan from January to August this year shows that transportation production has generally completed the task, and some have overfulfilled the task. In the maritime transport system, except for the Guangzhou Maritime Bureau, which currently lacks complete statistics, the Shanghai Maritime Bureau completed 100.3% of the passenger and freight turnover plan from January to August; the Yangtze River completed 127% of the freight turnover plan from January to August, mainly Sichuan grain transportation; there are no complete statistics on highway transportation in various provinces nationwide. Judging from the passenger and freight turnover completed by the Beijing-Tianjin Transportation Bureau from January to August, it only reached 97% of the plan. As for basic construction, due to the excessively large plan, the task was determined late, and most construction projects did not prepare enough, delaying the start time. According to the revised plan figures, from January to August, highway basic construction completed 48% of the annual plan, and navigation basic construction completed 52% of the annual plan. At present, we are stepping up supervision and inspection, and have deployed production increase and savings tasks, making the greatest efforts to strive to complete the plan tasks.

    The above-mentioned achievements in transportation work in the national economic recovery phase have prepared the necessary conditions for the planned construction of people's transportation in the future. However, there are still some problems, shortcomings, and errors in our work.

    The main problems and difficulties currently existing in transportation work are: Our current transportation industry has great complexity, dispersion, and diversity. Various types of transportation tools are scattered in various different economic regions and complex natural conditions. The organization and application of these tools are often not entirely appropriate. In addition, due to the unbalanced development of the national economy, we have not fully recognized the impact of this problem on transportation work, and we have also failed to master the regularity of the flow of major materials to organize reasonable transportation. As a result, transportation operations have become passive and chaotic. This is manifested in: Sometimes ships and vehicles are stopped waiting for goods, and sometimes goods are crowded waiting for transportation; water transportation has stoppages at the beginning of the month and insufficient capacity at the end of the month, and automobile transportation has a large no-load rate; on the one hand, the potential capacity of existing transportation capacity and equipment has not been fully utilized, and on the other hand, most vehicles and ships are old and equipment is simple, and there is a feeling of insufficient transportation capacity. In addition, untimely or excessive changes in consignment plans make it difficult to dispatch vehicles and ships. In terms of highway basic construction, in order to meet current needs, in the past, most of the methods adopted were to organize military, industrial, and civilian laborers to rush to repair and open traffic, making it difficult to prepare surveys in advance, and even often construction was carried out without survey documents; some lines were surveyed and approved for construction in sections at the same time, and only a very small number were carried out according to the procedure of surveying before construction. The current shortage of design and construction forces still exists. However, these difficulties and problems will gradually decrease and disappear as we enter the planned economic construction period in the future, coupled with our subjective efforts and overcoming them.

    The main shortcomings and errors in the current transportation work are that an overall and reasonable planned transportation system has not yet been established in ship and automobile transportation work. This is manifested in water transportation as: On the one hand, the problem of stevedores waiting for work is serious, and on the other hand, the non-productive berthing time of ships in ports is very long; on the one hand, the production tasks of shipyards are insufficient and the equipment utilization rate is extremely low, and on the other hand, a large number of ships are waiting for repair and cannot be repaired on time. In automobile transportation, the problems of insufficient transportation capacity and empty driving and downtime coexist. The reason is that there is insufficient understanding of the integrity and continuity of transportation production, and failure to grasp the dispatching work as the central link to connect various operation plans, and to closely combine them with various work contact systems in the main links. Poor enterprise management is concentratedly manifested in: high transportation costs, low efficiency, cumbersome procedures, and many accidents. The reason for high costs is that the operating efficiency is low, and various technical and economic indicators are still at a very low level. Conservative thinking hinders the further exploitation of the potential of existing equipment; in addition, cost management is backward, and many enterprises use the method of increasing consumption quotas and labor volume indicators to make the cost bury a large reserve force. Administrative expenses still account for a large proportion, and there is still a lot of waste in fuel and material consumption and repair costs. In short, many enterprises have not yet established economic accounting ideas, and capitalist management ideas have not been completely eliminated. In basic construction work, there is a lack of investigation and research on basic conditions, failure to possess reliable and systematic data, insufficient consideration of overall plans and overall designs, neglect of surveying and technical guidance, disregard of various specific conditions, and simply doing things with subjective enthusiasm. Construction is often carried out hastily, lacking construction plans and responsibility systems, resulting in much waste and engineering not meeting standards. For example, some highway projects have produced bridge and culvert cracks, roadbed collapses, and road surface churning, showing a blind and rash tendency to seek big, many, and fast results. In addition, there is a lack of leadership and management of the private transportation industry, ignoring its role in transportation, and the relationship between public and private is not normal; also, there is a lack of policy leadership for local transportation work, and the division of labor between the central government and local governments is not clear enough, resulting in local transportation not being well adapted to the development of the national economy and the needs of local people.

    In order to implement the general line and general tasks of the country during the transition period and the basic tasks of the national five-year plan, and thereby determine the future guidelines and tasks of transportation work, overcome shortcomings and errors, and improve work, the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government convened the 1953 National Transportation Conference in August. After everyone's research and discussion, they unanimously agreed with the future work guidelines and tasks proposed by the Central Ministry of Communications, and the regulations on the scope of management and leadership relationship of local transportation work. They believe that the transportation industry is an organic part of realizing national industrialization and socialist transformation. With the growth of industrial and agricultural production, the expansion and acceleration of commodity circulation, and the needs of national defense construction, transportation construction and transportation tasks will inevitably become increasingly heavy. Therefore, we must strengthen the study of Soviet experience, improve business management, fully utilize existing equipment and exploit the potential of existing equipment, and gradually increase the construction of ships, automobile modern transportation tools, dredge waterways and improve port equipment, build national defense and economic routes, and improve the quality of existing highways, so as to achieve the basic requirements of reducing costs, improving efficiency, and safe transportation.

    (1) In order to reduce transportation costs, increase transportation volume, improve transportation quality, accelerate ship and vehicle turnover, and ensure the completion and overcompletion of national transportation plans, state-owned transportation enterprises should vigorously implement production reforms, implement planned management and promote economic accounting systems step by step, develop inland river tug-barge transportation, and adhere to coastal and ocean transportation in the future. To this end, we must do the following: Strengthen economic investigation and grasp the true situation of production equipment; implement planned management, compile operation plans, improve dispatching agencies, and strengthen the responsibility system; promote advanced experience, lead the launch of production competitions and develop rationalization proposals, vigorously promote the maritime ship schedule chart method, the inland river tug-barge transportation method, the automobile transportation circular scheduling method, and continue to promote the "Safety, Four Fixes, and Two Thousand Ton-Kilometers" campaign; strengthen port work, unify port management regulations, and improve loading and unloading efficiency and quality; strengthen cost management and financial supervision, eliminate waste, and explore potential capabilities. And according to the different situations of each enterprise, specific requirements were put forward.

    (2) In the future period, basic construction will still focus on completing national defense highway projects. In terms of transportation, inland river navigation construction will be the focus, developing shallow-water tug-barge transportation, completing the renovation of inland river trunk lines, and carrying out new construction with emphasis, gradually increasing maritime and inland river transportation tools and equipment, and strengthening the technical guidance of local road and industrial and mining line construction projects. To this end, we must: attach importance to investigation and research, master reliable economic data and geological data, and propose correct planning tasks and conduct technical design based on them; continue to enrich design institutions and surveying forces; strengthen technical leadership and improve design quality. Highway construction must resolutely implement highway standard design, seriously pay attention to route selection and route determination to ensure that the engineering quality meets the principles of firmness, economy, and applicability; implement planned management, establish a responsibility system, overcome various confusion and waste phenomena and various responsibility accidents; in addition to the special approval of the use of temporary rush repair to open traffic or section survey and section approval of the flexible measures for construction, all infrastructure projects must follow the infrastructure procedures.

    (3) The guidelines and tasks of local transportation work should be to combine the specific circumstances of the locality under the national unified plan, and based on needs and possibilities, to rectify, transform, and develop the existing transportation industry step by step and in a planned manner; strengthen business and technical leadership, improve enterprise management and administrative management, leverage existing equipment capabilities, and focus on gradually developing modern transportation tools; strengthen the management and maintenance of existing highways and waterways, gradually improve highway quality and inland waterway port equipment, focus on dredging inland waterways, build simple standard roads suitable for local transportation tools, and major roads and bridges urgently needed by local people, in order to meet the growing economic construction and the needs of the broad masses of people. In order to implement the above-mentioned guidelines and tasks, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of local transportation work, clearly stipulate the scope of management of local transportation work, and the local transportation work should be directly led by the local people's governments at all levels, as well as the corresponding appropriate adjustment and enrichment of local transportation organizations.

    In the future, local transportation departments should pay attention to strengthening the leadership and management of individually owned private wooden sailboats and animal-powered vehicle transportation, and should help solve various operational difficulties as much as possible, and leverage their role in transportation. We should also pay attention to planned and appropriate construction of roads and bridges in areas of important economic significance, ethnic minority areas, old revolutionary base areas, and local specialty areas, as well as rely on the strength of the masses, use local materials, and carry out "bridge repair and road patching" work in rural areas.

    (4) Strengthen the leadership and management of the private transportation industry, especially the private shipping and automobile transportation industries. Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, fully utilize, improve, and leverage the capabilities of its transportation tools and equipment, implement the policy of taking both public and private interests into account, appropriately allocate operating routes and assign transportation tasks according to the performance of its ships and vehicles, actively assist it in improving business management, strengthen the maintenance and repair of ships and vehicles, and should gradually implement unified planning, unified sources of goods, and unified freight rates, so as to gradually realize the socialist transformation of the private transportation industry, and enable it to embark on the track of state capitalism and state planning step by step and with differentiation.

    (5) Resolutely implement the unified policy of safe production. Strengthen maritime affairs, port supervision, and highway and automobile supervision. Add security equipment, improve technical measures, and formulate safe operating procedures. Improve material supply and medical and health equipment at basic construction sites, especially in border areas. Conduct safety production education. Make the greatest efforts to ensure safety and prevent all possible accidents.

    In order to ensure that transportation work follows the general line and general tasks of the country during the transition period, and implements the established transportation work guidelines, policies, and tasks, it is also necessary to strengthen the leadership of political and ideological work in future work, resolutely overcome bureaucratism, subjectivism, decentralism, and the bias of neglecting political and ideological work; strengthen the study of economic construction theories, study advanced Soviet experience, and study the business of transportation work; attach importance to investigation and research, fully recognize and grasp the characteristics of the current transportation industry and transportation departments; strengthen the training of cadres, constantly promote cadres according to the two principles of political quality and business ability, and regard the work of training cadres and promoting cadres as a regular and major task. Only in this way can we improve future transportation work and complete the glorious tasks given to us by the country.

    关于交通工作的基本情况与今后方针任务的报告
    （一九五三年十月八日中央人民政府交通部章伯钧部长在政务院第一百九十次政务会议上的报告，并经同次会议批准）
    四年来，新中国的交通工作，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导下，各地人民政府积极支持，苏联专家无私的帮助和全体职工以及广大军工民工努力下，通过了各项社会改革运动和接管、整理、改造等工作，基本上已完成了我国交通工作恢复阶段的任务，并有了局部的发展，取得了不少成绩。
    第一、国营运输生产方面：四年来海上运输是在美帝国主义、蒋匪的封锁“禁运”扰乱破坏等困难情况下，逐步整顿恢复，组成了我们自己的海运力量，坚持了海上运输，并逐渐提高了运输效率。全国沿海一九五二年客货运输周转量中的百分之七十四是国营船舶所完成的。国营沿海的客货运周转量，如以一九五○年完成的数字为一百，则一九五二年客运周转量已提高四倍，货运周转量提高十一倍。沿海五大港已于今年五月结束了地方代管，海上运输中的船舶、港口、修船已由中央交通部统一经营管理，同时海运企业与港口装卸工人民主改革工作亦已结束。这些，对于组织统一的整体的海上运输，形成了必要的条件。此外，推行了船舶运行图表工作法，加强了船舶调度的计划性，港口工作创造了船舶码头仓库相互衔接的新作业法后，装卸效率有了不少改进。
    我国内河大部终年不冻，对运输具有很大的优越性。目前通航里程九万余公里，其中可通轮船的约占三分之一。全国内河一九五二年完成的客货运输周转量有半数以上是国营轮驳所完成的。一九五二年国营的客货运输周转量比一九五○年也有提高，以一九五○年为一百，则一九五二年提高百分之一百七十七。历年来内河运输对城乡交流、煤粮供应、各种重大工程建设如治淮、荆江分洪以及其他运输任务等，都起了很大的作用。今年上半年长江航运局完成了上半年计划百分之一百二十三，是超额完成任务的。对于川粮运输有了不少的贡献，目前尚在继续紧张的工作中。内河运输自推行苏联先进经验——拖驳运输法后，运输效率已有显著的提高，川江试航亦已成功，对于今后继续降低成本和减低运价创造了有利条件。长江自一九五○年至今已三次降低运价，一百余种货物运价经调整后，平均降低百分之三十以上。
    汽车运输是在国民党反动政府遗留下来的废墟上收拾起来的，车辆破烂，厂牌复杂，解放后经过整理拚修，营业车辆均已恢复，现均分散在各省市经营。一九五二年底止，全国营运里程已达九万三千余公里，班车里程七万余公里，对于短程面的运输和在地方交通中起了重要的作用。汽车运输企业，自一九五二年开始，各地都开展了“安全、四定、两千吨公里”运动，原订的燃润料、轮胎、修理里程、修理工料等四项定额标准，有的已经突破，从而降低了成本和运价。以汽油车为例，一九五二年的客运运价比一九五一年已平均降低百分之二十，货运降低运价百分之二十三。车吨月产已大致接近标准，有的省区已达到每一车吨每月两千吨公里的产量。一九五二年全国各省地方国营及国营的汽车完成客货运输周转量，货运比一九五○年提高周转量百分之一百二十六，客运周转量提高百分之六十五。汽车运输上也有不少创造，如浙江省今年车辆修理里程比一九五○年平均提高四倍，最高的纪录是一辆汽车经过一次修理可行驶十一万七千公里，是目前全国最高的行驶里程。
    第二、基本建设方面：我国原有公路大部是国民党反动政府在反共反人民的内战与日本帝国主义侵华战争期中，为满足其军事要求而修设的。蒋匪军败退时，又将大部分公路加以破坏。解放后经军民历年的大力抢修与改建，已完成了恢复工程，并开始重点建设。至一九五二年底止，新建、改建公路九千七百余公里。全国公路的通车里程比较一九四九年已增加了百分之七十三，现为十三万余公里，约有半数已达到晴雨通车的要求，并提高了行车时速。各省经常养护里程也已由一九五○年的七万五千公里发展到一九五二年的九万七千多公里。如安徽省推行了养路负责制和民主管理，并通过计划生产、自我检查和红旗竞赛等措施，创造了不少新的操作方法，提高施工效率五倍。东北创造了赵永喜土方工作法，工效比去年最高纪录又提高了一倍。
    这几年来的公路新建工程多在边疆地区，且大多是在气候十分恶劣，物质条件极端困难的条件下，依靠了广大军工、民工的积极性，克服各种困难进行施工的。
    航务建设在旧中国是为帝国主义所把持，缺乏建设基础，因此在解放后，无论是运输设备或工程设计、施工和管理等工作，均须从头做起。截至一九五二年底止，我们新添了船舶；修复了旧船；打捞了沉船；修建了码头；沿海与长江各大港口设备及助航设备已大体恢复；并完成了改建塘沽新港和扩建黄埔港的第一期工程。川江测量工作今年已全部完成，川江和长江中下游已进行了灯标建设及航标改革工作，保证了夜航安全，宜昌汉口间因已无须夜间停航，缩短了航行时间约三分之一，可提高船舶周转率百分之二十八。航务建设上今年又完成了另一项准备工作，是南北大运河一千七百多公里的查勘，使今后研究整治大运河计划有了一些技术资料和经济资料。
    第三、私营运输业方面：四年来，各私营运输业在国营运输业领导下，对于完成国家运输任务是起了一定作用的。为了更好的发挥私营轮船运输潜力，完成国家运输任务，我们对沿海与长江的私营轮船业正在进行整顿改革工作，并在业主完全自愿的条件下，实行公私合营，使私营轮船业逐步走上国家资本主义的道路。现沿海私营中兴、海鹰两轮船公司已实行公私合营，长江上海已有三十四家私营公司正在进行公私合营的组织工作，重庆强华、合众两私营公司已于今年上半年公私合营，业务经营有了改进，并由亏损转为盈余。民生公司自实行公私合营后，经过了一系列的整顿改革工作，船舶载重量已提高了百分之二十七，增建和改建了船舶约一万五千吨，运输量比过去的最高纪录提高了一倍多，川江运输成本减低了百分之三十强，营业上已改变了过去亏损情况转到盈余，已初步表现了公私合营的优越性。
    第四、群众运输方面：木帆船和骡马大车以及民间各种运输工具分布全国，为数众多，是一支密切关联着广大人民生活的运输大军。目前全国内河和沿海木帆船约有四百万吨，已经组织起来的兽力车二十余万辆，可以组织的约有二百余万辆。这些运输工具在过去解放战争中，城乡物资交流中，重大工程建设以及城市基建工料运输中起了重要作用，在今后一定的历史时期内，还有其重大的作用。特别是内河木帆船担负了内河运输周转量的百分之四十六的运输任务。今年全国木帆船已完成了民主改革工作，通过民主改革运动，不仅了解和掌握了民船的基本情况，并在政治上取得了重大的收获，同时在航政管理与运输经营上亦随着有了若干改进，目前木帆船运粮亏斤已大为减少，长沙、衡阳两地的运粮亏斤，已由过去的千分之十八降低为千分之一。各地在组织与管理个体民营的木帆船、兽力车运输方面，均取得了一些经验，并有力地配合了当地的生产建设工作。
    今年一至八月份完成计划的情况，根据现有统计看，运输生产方面，一般是完成任务，个别是超额完成任务的。海运系统除广州海运局目前尚缺完整统计外，上海海运局完成一至八月份客货运周转量计划的百分之一百点三；长江完成一至八月份货运周转量计划的百分之一百二十七，主要是川粮运输；全国各省公路运输尚无完整统计，就京津运输局完成一至八月份客货运周转量说，只达计划的百分之九十七。至于基本建设方面，由于计划过大，任务确定较晚，大多数施工工程准备工作做的不够，推迟了开工时间。根据修正计划数字来衡量实绩，一至八月份公路基本建设完成全年计划的百分之四十八，航务基本建设完成全年计划的百分之五十二。目前我们正抓紧督促检查，并布置了增产节约任务，尽最大的努力来争取完成计划任务。
    上述的交通工作在国民经济恢复阶段的成就，为今后有计划的建设人民交通事业，准备了必要的条件。但是在我们工作中还存在有一些问题与一些缺点和错误。
    目前交通工作存在的主要问题和困难是：我们当前的交通事业具有很大的复杂性、分散性和多样性，多种不同性质的运输工具，分散在各种不同的经济区域和复杂的自然条件下，在对这些工具的组织和运用上，往往不尽恰当。加之国民经济发展的不平衡，我们未充分认识到这一问题在交通运输工作中所产生的影响，同时我们也未能很好掌握主要物资流向的规律性来组织合理运输，结果引起了运输作业上的被动忙乱。表现在：有时停航、停车待货，有时货物拥挤待运；水路运输月初停航、月终运力不足，汽车运输空驶率很大；一方面是现有运力与设备的潜在能力尚未充分发挥，另方面是车船大多破旧，设备简陋，感到运力不足。再加上托运计划不及时或变动过多，使车船调度上感到很大的被动。就公路基本建设方面说，为了适应当前需要，过去大多采取组织军工、民工抢修通车的方式，很难预先做好测设，甚至往往无测设文件即行施工；也有部分线路是一面分段测设一面分段批准施工的，只有极少数是按先测设后施工的程序进行的。目前设计施工力量不足的情况仍然存在。但这些困难和问题，在进入今后有计划的经济建设时期，加上我们主观努力和克服，是会逐渐减少和消失的。
    目前交通工作中的主要缺点和错误，在轮船和汽车运输工作中，尚未建立起整体的和合理的计划运输。表现在水路运输上是：一方面装卸工人待时问题严重，一方面在港船只非生产性停泊时间很长；一方面修船厂生产任务不足，设备利用率极低，一方面又有大批待修船只积压，不能按时修好。在汽车运输方面，运力不足与空驶停歇的问题同时存在。其原因在于对运输生产的整体性、连续性认识不足，和未能抓住调度工作为中心环节，将各种作业计划联系起来，以及在主要环节上用各种工作联系制度使之密切结合。企业经营管理不善，集中突出的表现是：运输费用高、效率低、手续繁、事故多，费用高的原因是由于营运效率低，各项技术经济指标还停留在很低水平，保守思想阻碍了进一步发挥现有设备的潜在能力；另外则由于成本管理落后，许多企业用提高消耗定额和劳动量指标的方法使成本埋伏下很大的后备力量，行政费仍占很大的比例，燃物料消耗和修理费用仍有很大浪费。总之许多企业经济核算思想尚未树立起来，资本主义经营管理思想尚未彻底肃清。在基本建设工作中，缺乏基本情况的调查研究，未能占有可靠的系统的资料，对统盘计划和整体设计考虑不足，忽视测设工作和技术指导，不顾各种具体条件，单凭主观热情办事，每每仓促施工，缺乏施工计划和责任制度，造成许多浪费和工程不符标准，如部分的公路工程产生了桥涵裂缝，路基坍塌和路面翻浆等，表现了贪大、贪多、贪快的盲目冒进倾向。此外，如对私营运输业缺乏领导与管理，忽视其在运输中的作用，公私关系不够正常；又如对地方交通工作缺乏方针政策的领导，中央与地方的分工不够明确，致使地方交通事业未能很好适应国民经济的发展和当地人民的需要等。
    为了贯彻国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务和国家五年计划的基本任务，并从而确定今后交通工作的方针任务，克服缺点错误，改进工作，今年八月间召开了中央人民政府交通部一九五三年全国交通会议，经过大家研究讨论，一致同意了中央交通部所提出的今后工作方针任务，和地方交通工作管理范围、领导关系问题的规定。认为：交通运输事业是实现国家工业化和社会主义改造的有机组成部分，随着工农业生产的增长，商品流通的扩大和加速，以及国防建设的需要，交通建设与运输任务必将日趋繁重。因此必须加强学习苏联经验，改进经营管理，充分利用现有设备与发挥现有设备的潜在能力，并逐步增建船舶、汽车近代运输工具，疏通航道和改善港口设备，修建国防与经济路线并提高现有公路质量，从而达到降低成本、提高效率与安全运输的基本要求。
    （一）国营运输企业为降低运输成本，增加运输数量，提高运输质量，加速船舶、车辆周转，保证完成和超额完成国家运输计划，今后应大力贯彻生产改革，有步骤地实行计划管理和推行经济核算制，发展内河拖驳运输，坚持沿海与远洋运输。为此必须做好：加强经济调查，掌握生产设备的真实情况；实行计划管理，编制作业计划，健全调度机构和加强责任制；推行先进经验，有领导地发动生产竞赛和开展合理化建议的运动，大力推广海运船舶运行图表工作法、内河拖驳运输法、汽车运输推行循环调度法和继续推广“安全、四定、两千吨公里”运动；加强港湾工作，统一港务管理规章，提高装卸效率和质量；加强成本管理和财务监督，杜绝浪费，发掘潜在能力等工作。并根据各企业的不同情况，提出了不同的具体要求。
    （二）基本建设在今后一个时期内，仍以完成国防公路工程为首要任务。在运输方面，以内河航运建设为重点，发展浅水拖驳运输，完成内河干线的整修工作，并有重点地进行新建，逐渐增强海上与内河运输工具与设备，加强地方道路和工矿线路修建工程的技术指导。为此必须：重视调查研究工作，掌握可靠的经济资料和地质资料，据以提出正确的计划任务和进行技术设计；继续充实设计机构和测设力量；加强技术领导，提高设计质量，公路建设上坚决推行公路标准设计，严重注意选线、定线工作，以保证工程质量符合坚固、经济和适用的原则；推行计划管理，建立责任制度，克服各种混乱和浪费现象以及各种责任事故；公路修建除经特别批准采用临时抢修通车或分段测设分段批准施工的变通办法外，所有基建工程均须遵照基建程序办事。
    （三）地方交通工作的方针与任务，应是在国家统一计划下，结合当地具体情况，根据需要与可能，对现有运输事业有步骤有计划地加以整顿、改造与开辟；加强业务技术领导，改进企业经营与行政管理，发挥现有设备能力，并重点地逐步地发展近代运输工具；对现有公路与航道加强管理养护，逐步改善公路质量和内河航道港口设备，重点疏浚内河航道，修建适合于当地运输工具通行的简易标准道路，和当地人民迫切需要的大路、桥渡等，以适应日益增长的经济建设和广大人民生活的需要。为贯彻上述方针任务，必须加强地方交通工作的领导，明确规定地方交通工作管理范围和地方交通工作由各级地方人民政府直接领导，以及相应的适当的调整和充实地方交通组织机构。
    今后地方交通部门，应注意加强对个体民营的木帆船和兽力车运输的领导和管理，应尽可能地帮助解决经营上的各种困难，并发挥其在运输中的作用。还应注意在有重要经济意义的地区、少数民族区、老革命根据地和土特产区有计划的适当的修建道路和桥渡，以及依靠群众力量，就地取材，进行乡间“修桥补路”工作。
    （四）加强对私营运输业首先是私营轮船和汽车运输业的领导与管理，在国营经济领导下，充分利用、改进和发挥其运输工具与设备的能力，贯彻公私兼顾政策，根据其船舶车辆性能，适当地调配营运线路和分配运输任务，积极协助其改进经营管理，加强船舶车辆的保养修理工作，并应逐步实行统一计划、统一货源和统一运价，以逐步实现对私营运输业的社会主义改造，使之有步骤有区别地走上国家资本主义和国家计划的轨道。
    （五）坚决贯彻安全生产统一的方针。加强海务、港务监督和公路、汽车监理工作。增添保安设备，改进技术措施，制定安全操作规程。改善基建工地特别是边疆地区的物资供应与医疗卫生设备。进行安全生产的教育。尽最大努力保证安全和预防一切可能发生的事故。
    为了保证交通工作遵循国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务，并贯彻既定的交通工作的方针政策和任务，还必须在今后的工作中，加强政治思想的领导，坚决克服官僚主义、主观主义、分散主义和忽视政治思想工作的偏向；加强学习经济建设的理论、学习苏联先进经验、钻研交通运输工作的业务；重视调查研究工作，充分认识并掌握当前交通事业和交通部门的特点；加强培养干部，根据政治品质和业务能力两条原则，不断的提拔干部，把培养干部和提拔干部的工作，当做经常的重大任务。只有这样，才能改进今后的交通工作，完成国家所给予我们的光荣任务。
