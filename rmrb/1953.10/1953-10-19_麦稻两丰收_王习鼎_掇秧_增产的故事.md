Wheat and Rice, a Double Harvest
    ——The Story of Wang Xiding's "Late-Season Rice Transplanting" and Increased Production
    Li Shouyi, Xia Gang
    Wang Xiding, a farmer from Jianshan Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, achieved a bumper harvest of both rice and wheat this year by using the method of "late-season rice transplanting." The wheat and rice produced per mu of land combined to exceed 1,000 jin.
    Wang Xiding was able to achieve such a harvest because he was diligent in exploring and accumulating experience in cultivation, and found a way to increase production. In the past, although he farmed several mu of land, the rice and wheat harvests never aligned properly, and there was never enough grain to eat each year. He often thought, how wonderful it would be if rice seedlings could be transplanted in the fields after the wheat harvest, so that both wheat and rice would have good harvests in the same year! Before liberation, he had boldly experimented with this, but it failed. If one waited until the wheat was fully mature and harvested before transplanting rice seedlings, it would be about ten days later than usual. "Yellow seedlings are vulnerable day and night," and if transplanted late, they would be eaten by rice stem borers, usually resulting in only a 50% yield. If the rice seedlings were transplanted on time, the wheat had to be harvested early, which would greatly reduce the wheat yield. The timing of rice and wheat harvesting and planting could never be properly staggered. This contradiction remained unresolved.
    In 1949, one day, he passed through the neighboring village of Zhuwadian and saw that rice seedlings had been transplanted in fields where wheat had been grown, and they had not been eaten by insects. After detailed inquiries, he learned that this was because the method of "late-season rice transplanting" was used, and the transplanted seedlings were not yellow seedlings, but rather green seedlings that had already grown and changed. Wang Xiding was greatly inspired by this.
    In 1950, when the wheat was not yet harvested, he transplanted (late-season transplanting) the rice seedlings early in another field, allowing the rice seedlings to develop first. After the wheat was harvested, he then transplanted them into the fields where the wheat had been harvested. However, due to lack of experience, he transplanted the seedlings too large, and when transplanting them, he divided most of the seedlings into two clumps, which broke the roots. After being transplanted, the seedlings could not develop normally. That year, the rice was still eaten by insects, and twelve shi of paddy fields only yielded eight shi of rice. The seedlings that were not divided into clumps had a higher yield. In 1951, he improved his method by transplanting the late-season seedlings one clump at a time, and the rice grew well, matured early, and was not eaten by insects. The harvest reached the normal yield. When harvesting rice in 1951, he found that the seedlings with unwashed mud attached to the roots grew even better during late-season transplanting. In 1952, when transplanting seedlings, he did not wash the mud at all, and the yield was even higher than in 1951. Because Wang Xiding had increased production year after year, he was named a county-level model of high yield. This year, Wang Xiding was confident and waited until the wheat he planted was fully mature before harvesting it. Not only was the quality good, but the average yield reached more than 280 jin per mu. The rice fields where seedlings were transplanted after wheat harvesting yielded an average of more than 850 jin of rice per mu. This year, the rice fields where he transplanted late-season seedlings yielded 30% more than the rice fields where he did not, and nearly doubled the normal yield. In this way, Wang Xiding harvested both wheat and increased rice production. In the past, farmer Wang Zisi laughed at Wang Xiding for pulling up and transplanting rice seedlings, saying it was a thankless task, and that "Wang Xiding has become confused after the liberation, playing around with the fields." However, the fact that Wang Xiding had increased production year after year convinced him. This year, he also transplanted late-season seedlings, and not only harvested 360 jin more wheat than last year, but also harvested 420 jin more rice than last year. He was therefore named a high-yield household in the district.
    The late-season rice transplanting method not only ensures that both rice and wheat are planted and harvested at the right time, but also advances the maturity of rice and avoids insect pests. This is because rice stem borers only pupate when the rice is heading. When the moths emerge from the pupae, the rice ears have already begun to form grains, and the rice stalks have hardened, making it difficult for the borers to eat them. This is unlike yellow seedlings, which meet the moths just as they are heading, resulting in a field of white ears eaten by the borers. The Xishui County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hubei Province promoted the late-season rice transplanting method during the drought resistance campaign, mobilizing the masses to transplant seedlings first in order to resist drought and protect seedlings. As a result, although the transplanting was delayed by half a month to twenty days, the seedlings generally grew well and matured quickly because they were transplanted late-season. Shi Ruide, a farmer in Wangcheng Township, transplanted seedlings during the drought resistance period, and the fields where he transplanted late-season seedlings yielded more than 30 jin of rice per shi of land than the fields where he did not. Now, farmers in Jianshan Township and nearby villages know this method.

    麦稻两丰收
    ——王习鼎“掇秧”增产的故事
    李守宜　夏　纲
    湖北省浠水县尖山乡农民王习鼎，今年用“掇秧”的方法，得到稻麦两熟的丰收，每亩田生产的小麦和稻谷，合起来有一千多斤。
    王习鼎能够得到这样的收成，是因为他在耕作中肯用心摸索，积累经验，找到了增产的门路。他过去虽然种了几亩田，但总是稻子接不上麦子，麦子接不上稻子，粮食年年不够吃。他曾想，如果能在收割小麦以后的田里插稻秧，麦子和稻子在一年之中都有好收成，那该多么好啊！解放前，他曾大胆试验过，结果失败了。如果等小麦完全成熟，收割小麦以后再插稻秧，那就要比一般的田晚插十天左右，“黄秧分昼夜”，插晚了，就被螟虫吃掉，一般只能收五成；如果要按时插秧，就得提早割麦，这样，麦子就要大大减产。稻麦收、种的时间，怎么也不能很好地错开。这个矛盾一直没有得到解决。
    一九四九年，有一天，他路过邻村竹瓦店，看见路边种过小麦的田里，插上稻秧并没有被虫吃掉。经过详细询问，才知道那是因为用了“掇秧”的方法，插的不是黄秧，而是已经发了棵转了异的青秧。王习鼎由此得到很大启示。
    一九五○年，当小麦还没有收割时，他就把稻秧提早掇（寄秧）在另外一块田里，让稻秧先发育，到收割小麦后，再移插到割了小麦的田里。但是因为没有经验，他把秧棵子掇大了，到插秧的时候，把大部分秧又分成两兜插，结果扯断了秧根，插下去后，秧棵不能正常发育。这年，稻子还是被虫吃了不少，十二石谷田才打了八石稻谷。其中有一部分没有分兜插的秧，就收成高些。一九五一年，他改进了一步，把掇的秧仍一兜归一兜插下去，结果稻子生长良好，成熟期提早，没有被虫吃掉，收成达到了常年产量。一九五一年收稻时，他发现在插掇秧时，没有洗泥的秧把，长得更好。一九五二年插秧时，他就完全没有洗泥，结果产量比一九五一年又提高了。因为王习鼎连年增产，他就被评为县丰产模范。今年王习鼎因为心里有了底，把种的小麦，一直等到完全成熟才收下来，不但成色好，每亩产量平均达到二百八十多斤；收麦后掇了秧的稻田，平均每亩收稻八百五十多斤。他今年掇了秧的稻田比不掇秧的稻田增产三成，比常年产量增产近一倍。这样，王习鼎既收了小麦，又增产了稻子。过去，农民王自思笑王习鼎把稻秧扯上掇下的，吃力不讨好，说“王习鼎翻身翻糊涂了，把大丘的田打彩儿玩”。但王习鼎连年增产的事实说服了他，今年他也掇了秧，不但比去年多打了三百六十斤小麦，还比去年多收了四百二十斤稻谷。他也因此被评为区里的丰产户。
    掇秧法不但能使稻、麦都收种适时，而且能提早稻谷成熟期，免除虫害。因为在稻谷出穗时，螟虫才做蛹，待螟从蛹出来时，稻穗已开始抹子，稻秆也已变硬，螟虫很难吃进去了，不像黄秧出穗时正和飞蛾碰头，吃得一片白。中共湖北省浠水县委会在抗旱斗争中，宣传掇秧法，发动群众先掇秧，以抗旱保苗。结果，插秧虽然晚了半月到二十天，但因为插的是掇秧，一般还是生长良好，成熟得快。该县望城乡农民石瑞德在抗旱期间插的秧，掇了秧的田比没有掇秧的田，每石田多打三十多斤稻谷。现在，尖山乡和附近农村的农民都知道这一方法了。
