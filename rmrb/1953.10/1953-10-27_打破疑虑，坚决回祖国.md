    "Break Through Doubts, Resolutely Return to the Motherland"
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Yan Wu
    "Yue Heidan, who had been in the explanation tent for nearly three hours, has finally returned!" Our explanation representative, Bai Weichuan, representing the motherland, stood in front of the reception station, looking forward with the heart of a mother expecting her son's return. Before long, a truck carrying Yue Heidan returned. Yue Heidan jumped out of the car and grasped Bai Weichuan's hand. Bai Weichuan stroked Yue Heidan's shoulder and said, "Do you still recognize me?" Yue Heidan's face immediately flushed red, and he said with a mixture of shyness and joy, "Motherland, Motherland, how could I not recognize you?"
    Yue Heidan's process of breaking through doubts and returning to the motherland concentratedly embodies the extreme doubts caused by the long-term terror imposed on prisoners of war by American special agents. Yue Heidan himself said: "In the prisoner of war camp, I looked forward to returning home every day and night, but could I really return? This was the biggest question in my mind. Another question was, could the people of the motherland forgive me?"
    On October 17th, in the tent waiting for explanation, Yue Heidan and another comrade-in-arms, Ni Xiaomao, who had already returned, were eating lunch together. He nudged Ni Xiaomao with his leg, and Ni Xiaomao secretly wrote the words "Return Home" in his palm. Yue Heidan thought to himself, "When I get to the explanation tent, if there is a real opportunity, I will desperately escape this hell." However, when he thought of returning home, the roars of the special agents before departure rang in his ears again: "If anyone's expression is a little off, or says 'return to the mainland,' immediately rush into the tent, grab him, smash him to death, and eat his heart!" Yue Heidan was immediately terrified. The shadow of the special agents' terror and atrocities in the prisoner of war camp constantly assailed his heart. Yue Heidan also thought: "In front of me and behind me, there is either the special agent Team Leader Ding, or members of the 'Garrison Team,' surrounding me layer upon layer. How can I escape to return home? Moreover, the special agents also said that as long as one of the Swiss or Swedish representatives in the neutral country doesn't raise their hand to approve, it means that even if you want to return home, you will be sent back to the original tent!" Yue Heidan entered the No. 15 explanation tent with extreme apprehension under the clamoring of the special agents.
    The first thing Yue Heidan saw when he entered the tent was the explanation representative of the motherland. According to his desire to return home, he should have rushed forward, fallen into the "arms of the motherland," and poured out all the suffering he had endured and the words he wanted to say. However, he touched the "anti-communist" words and the Kuomintang flag that the enemy had forced him to tattoo on his body, and worried again: "How can I have the face to return to see my motherland with a body full of 'anti-communist' words?" So he lowered his head.
    Explanation representative Bai Weichuan said to him kindly and warmly: "I represent the people of the motherland, and I represent the leaders of the Volunteer Army to welcome you back home. From now on, the motherland is in front of you, and the enemy will not dare to threaten you anymore..." "Even if the enemy forced you to tattoo the words, the words are only tattooed on the skin, they haven't damaged your heart."
    "Motherland, you know my heart hasn't been pierced." Yue Heidan's heart suddenly lit up. However, the deceptive and intimidating words of the American and Chiang Kai-shek special agents reappeared in his mind: "You have tattooed your bodies, and you will be skinned alive when you go back." Although Yue Heidan didn't quite believe it, he still felt uneasy. "Having fallen into this state, what can I use to explain to the people of the motherland?" Yue Heidan paced restlessly in the tent,
    nodding his head for a while, shaking his head for a while, understanding one thing, then worrying about another. He was full of worries, looking left and right, his mind was "spinning," and his face became even more red and hot, sighing. At this time, the explanation representative asked him kindly again: "Now you must make a decision quickly, decisively. What are your concerns?" Yue Heidan looked up at the representative again, and the explanation representative read aloud to him the letter from Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai to our captured personnel. Yue Heidan secretly looked at the letter while saying, "I want to speak, I want to speak..." His lips were trembling, but he couldn't speak.
    At this moment, the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek special agent, posing as a "detaining party representative," hurriedly pointed to the door for those not applying for repatriation, gestured, winked, and directed the special agents outside the tent to shout: "Yue Heidan, if you don't come back, you'll lose your head!" The American observer representatives also quickened their pace, pacing back and forth outside the repatriation application door with a fierce look. Yue Heidan immediately became nervous. He wanted to listen to the motherland's representative continue to explain to him, and he also wanted to secretly see if any special agents were entering the door to arrest him. When the voices of the special agents outside the tent became louder, he nervously said the words that the special agents had told him to say in advance: "Return to Taiwan, return to Taiwan..." Because otherwise he was afraid the special agents would rush in.
    To say "return to Taiwan" in front of the motherland's relatives, what a great shame! Yue Heidan hated these words, but he didn't dare not say them. After saying them, he thought: "Doesn't the motherland misunderstand me even more?" Yue Heidan was covered in sweat, his heart was cut to the core. When he looked at the expression of the motherland's representative again, the motherland's representative still said kindly to him: "You said return to Taiwan, isn't that what you really mean!" Then, the motherland's representative once again issued a loud call to Yue Heidan: "Don't be afraid! Stand up straight, boldly apply to return home!" At this very moment, the despicable and shameless American representative rushed to his side, attempting to threaten him and obstruct his repatriation. However, Representative Bai Weichuan immediately sternly shouted at the American representative: "What are you doing? Don't move, get back!"
    How much encouragement and courage the motherland brought to Yue Heidan. "Motherland! I want..." He quickly glanced at the door outside the non-repatriation application, and rushed towards the "return home" door, saying, "I want to return home."
    The American "observer representatives" and Taiwan special agents became anxious when they saw that he wanted to return home, and openly made a big fuss, shouting: "He (Yue Heidan) is returning to Taiwan, he is returning to Taiwan..." Threatening Yue Heidan at this last moment, causing him to retreat. The Swiss and Swedish representatives in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's subsidiary agency also unreasonably requested the Indian chairman to repeatedly let Yue Heidan consider for five minutes. In the chaos and noise, the Indian soldier guarding the prisoner of war pulled Yue Heidan towards the door for those not applying for repatriation, scaring Yue Heidan into grabbing the threshold tightly, saying: "I'm not going, why don't you let me speak!" "I'm not going, why don't you let me speak!" So an Indian officer pulled him back into the tent and put him on General Thimayya's car to be held in solitary confinement.
    After Yue Heidan left the tent, the special agents' scolding still made him palpitate. He was deeply afraid of being taken back to the original tent, and he was ready to jump out of the car and run away at any time. When he arrived at the Indian Army Headquarters, he repeatedly asked: "Are you still going to send me back to the original tent?" "Are there any special agents in the solitary confinement tent?" "Can the special agents rush in and grab me?"
    Yue Heidan stayed in the solitary confinement tent for one night, and his mind gradually cleared up. He gradually believed that applying for repatriation now would no longer result in being beaten to death by special agents. When the personnel of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission came to ask him, Yue Heidan raised his voice and replied decisively: "I am determined to return to my motherland."

    “打破疑虑，坚决回祖国”
    新华社记者  阎吾
    “在解释帐篷里呆了将近三个钟点的岳黑旦终于回来了！”我方解释代表白卫川代表祖国，怀着母亲期待儿子归来的心情，站在招待站门前眺望着。不一会，卡车载着岳黑旦回来了。岳黑旦跳下汽车，一把握着白卫川的手。白卫川抚着岳黑旦的肩膀说：“你还认识我吗？”岳黑旦脸上顿时泛起一道红润，羞喜交集地连声说：“祖国，祖国，我怎能不认识你？”
    岳黑旦打破疑惧回到祖国的过程，集中地体现出美方特务长期施加于战俘身上的极度恐怖所造成的重重疑虑。岳黑旦自己说：“在战俘营里，我每天每夜都盼望着回国，可是能回得了吗？这是我脑子里最大的问号。另一个疑问就是，祖国人民能原谅我吗？”
    十月十七日，在等待解释的帐篷里，岳黑旦和另一个已经归来的难友倪小毛曾坐在一起吃午饭，他用腿碰了碰倪小毛，倪小毛用手指偷偷在他的手心里写了“回国”两个字。岳黑旦心里想：“到了解释帐篷，看样子要是真有机会，我就拚死逃出这个地狱。”然而，当他一想到回国，特务在临出发前的咆哮声又在他耳旁响起来：“那一个脸色有点不对头，或是说了‘回大陆’，就马上冲进帐篷，把他抓回来砸死，吃他的心！”岳黑旦顿时毛骨悚然了。剥皮、挖心、活活地砸死，特务们在战俘营中的恐怖暴行的阴影，一阵一阵地侵袭着他的心。岳黑旦又想：“在我的身前身后，不是特务丁队长，就是‘警备队’员，一层一层地把我夹起来。要想回国，怎么能逃得脱呢？何况特务还说，只要中立国里的瑞士或瑞典代表中有一个不举手通过，就是表示了要回国也要送回原来的帐篷！”岳黑旦就带着极度疑惧的心情，在特务分子的叫嚣下走进了十五号解释帐篷。
    岳黑旦走进帐篷的第一眼就见到了祖国的解释代表，按照他渴望回国的心意，该是扑上前去，倒在“祖国怀里”，把自己所受的磨难和要说的话一下倾吐出来。可是，他摸了摸身上被敌人强迫刺上的“反共”字样和国民党旗，又难过地顾虑起来：“带着一身‘反共’字怎么有脸回去见我的祖国？”于是，他低下了头。
    解释代表白卫川向他亲切而热情地说：“我代表祖国人民，代表志愿军首长来接你回国。从现在起，祖国就在你面前，敌人不敢再威胁你……”。“敌人就是强迫你刺了字，字也是刺在肉皮上，没有刺坏了你的心。”
    “祖国，你知道没有扎了我的心。”岳黑旦的心，一下子亮起来了。然而，往日美蒋特务欺骗和恫吓的言词又出现在他脑中：“你们刺了一身字，回去要被活剥皮的。”岳黑旦虽然不大相信，可是心里总有些不清亮。“落得这个下场，拿什么向祖国人民交代？”岳黑旦不安地在帐篷里走来走去，
    一会点点头，一会又摇摇头，这一头考虑通了，那
    一头又上来了。他前忧后虑，左顾右盼，脑子在一个劲地“转圈”，脸也更加变红、发热，唉声叹气。这时，解释代表又亲切地问他：“现在你要快下决心，当机立断，还有什么顾虑呢？”岳黑旦又抬头看了代表一眼，解释代表把金日成元帅、彭德怀将军给我方被俘人员的信朗读给他听。岳黑旦一面用眼偷偷地看了看那个信件，一面说：“我要说，我要说……”。只见他嘴唇在颤动，可是说不出话来。
    这时，冒充“拘留方代表”的台湾蒋匪特务，乘着岳黑旦的话到唇边停下来的时候，急忙指着未申请遣返的门打手势、使眼色，并指挥帐篷外面的特务大喊大叫：“岳黑旦，你再不回来，马上就要你的脑袋！”美方的观察代表也加快了脚步，在申请遣返门外气虎虎地来回走着。岳黑旦立刻紧张起来，他又要听祖国代表继续向他解释，又要偷偷地看看有没有特务进门来抓他。当帐篷外面特务的声音愈高的时候，他就吓得神经质地说着特务事先叫他说的话：“回台湾，回台湾……”。因为不然他怕特务会冲进来。
    在祖国亲人面前说“回台湾”，这是多大的耻辱啊！岳黑旦痛恨这句话，但是他不敢不说。说了以后，他又想：“祖国不是更不理解我了呢？”岳黑旦冒出满头大汗，心如刀割。当他再一次地看看祖国代表的脸色时，祖国代表还是亲切地对他说：“你说回台湾，这不是你的真心话吧！”接着，祖国代表又一次地向岳黑旦发出宏亮的召唤：“不用怕！挺直腰板，大胆地申请回国！”正在这个时刻，卑鄙无耻的美方代表竟冲到他身边来，企图威胁他，阻挠他遣返。但是，白卫川代表立即严正地向美方代表喝道：“干什么？不准动，滚回去！”
    祖国给岳黑旦带来了多大的鼓舞和勇敢。“祖国！我要……”他回头迅速地向未申请遣返门外看了一眼，就一头跑向“回国”的门，一面说：“我要回国。”
    美方“观察代表”和台湾特务一看他要回国就发急了，就公然大吵大闹起来：“他（岳黑旦）是回台湾的，他是回台湾的……”，在这最后一刻威胁岳黑旦，使他又退回去。中立国遣返委员会附属机构中的瑞士、瑞典代表也无理地要求印度主席一再让岳黑旦考虑五分钟。在混乱与吵闹中，看管战俘的印度士兵拉着岳黑旦向未申请遣返的门外走，吓得岳黑旦死死抓住门槛说：“我不去，为什么不让我说话！”“我不去，为什么不让我说话！”于是一位印度军官又把他拉回帐篷，并送上蒂迈雅将军的汽车载去单独看管。
    岳黑旦走出帐篷后，特务们的叫骂声，还阵阵地使他悸动。他深怕把他载到原来的帐篷中去，他准备随时跳下汽车逃跑。到了印度部队司令部他还一再地问：“是不是还要把我送回原来的帐篷？”“单独看管帐篷里面有没有特务？”“特务能不能冲进来抓我？”
    岳黑旦在单独看管帐篷里住了一夜，他的脑子渐渐清醒过来，他渐渐相信现在申请遣返再不会被特务打死。当中立国遣返委员会人员来询问他的时候，岳黑旦便提高嗓子斩钉截铁地回答说：“我坚决要回到自己的祖国。”
