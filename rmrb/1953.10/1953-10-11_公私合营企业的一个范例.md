Short Commentary:

　　In the past four years of the New China, many joint public-private enterprises have been developed. After these enterprises became joint ventures, most of them improved their management, increased production, developed their businesses, and all of them have been profitable. The case of the Minsheng Shipping Company is an example of these enterprises.

　　Minsheng Shipping Company was a relatively large private shipping company. In the past, due to bloated organization and poor management, it suffered losses year after year. After liberation, although the People's Government continued to provide loans to maintain it, the company itself did not fundamentally reform, and it still failed to reverse the situation of continuous losses. After the joint public-private ownership was implemented last autumn, the state dispatched cadres to participate in management. Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, the organization was rectified, a series of democratic reforms and production reforms were carried out, a workers' representative meeting was convened, and a campaign to increase production and practice economy was launched. The production enthusiasm of the workers was highly stimulated, and production efficiency rapidly increased, and the enterprise's operation quickly turned from loss to profit. Private shareholders received dividends for the first time in over a decade, and the workers' living standards and welfare were further improved. The achievement of these results is inseparable from the leadership of the state-owned economy and the leadership of public shares in the enterprise; it is inseparable from the strong support of the state in terms of technology, capital, raw materials, and equipment supply; and it is inseparable from the transformation of the workers' work attitude and the high degree of production enthusiasm.

　　This also fully illustrates that: due to the addition of socialist elements in private enterprises, the capitalist nature of production relations has been transformed into a semi-socialist nature of production relations, giving productivity a wide range of activities and rapid improvement. This is where the superiority of joint public-private enterprises lies.

　　Secondly, from the business development process of Minsheng Shipping Company after the joint venture, we also draw the following experiences: First, it is necessary to carry out democratic reforms and production reforms under the leadership of the government and the working class, to thoroughly eradicate the fatal problems such as backward management, production waste, and bloated organization left over from the old organization, and to establish various progressive systems on a new basis, especially the system of democratic management, and establish a new business policy of serving national construction and the needs of the people. These reforms are the starting point for progress and are all very necessary. Second, the enterprise established a new board of directors, and both public and private representatives should respect each other's rights and interests, give full play to the powers of the board of directors, and appropriately adopt a consultative approach to solve major issues of the enterprise. This not only increased the enthusiasm of private shareholders, but also enabled the public and private sectors to cooperate under the national policy and plan, rely on employees, and do a good job in business. Third, the reasonable distribution of profits can not only ensure the normal development of production and take care of the lives and welfare of workers, but also make investors profitable. This concretely and vividly reflects the state's economic policy of taking into account both public and private interests, thereby enhancing the confidence of private operators.

　　Since liberation, joint public-private enterprises have greatly increased. The development of this kind of economy, in which state capital and private capital cooperate, has played a good role in developing production and ensuring social supply. It is needed for the country's economic construction, and it is also an important step for private enterprises to carry out socialist transformation. In the future, with the development of the country's economic construction, joint public-private enterprises will undoubtedly have more and more extensive increases. Therefore, we should attach great importance to this work. In particular, enterprises that have already implemented joint public-private ownership should create and summarize more and more mature experiences for exchange and promotion.

### 公私合营企业的一个范例

    公私合营企业的一个范例
    新中国四年来，发展了许多公私合营企业。这些企业在合营之后，大都改善了经营管理，提高了生产，发展了业务，并且都获得了盈余。民生轮船公司的情况，就是这些企业中的一例。
    民生轮船公司是一个规模较大的私营航运业。过去由于机构臃肿、经营不善，以致年年亏损。解放后，人民政府虽不断贷款维持，但因公司本身没有从根本上加以改革，仍然没有能够扭转一直赔累的局面。去年秋天公私合营之后，国家派遣干部参加了经营管理，在国营经济领导下，整顿了机构，进行了一系列的民主改革与生产改革，召开了职工代表会，开展了增产节约运动。职工的生产积极性得到高度发挥，生产效率也就迅速提高起来，企业经营也很快转亏为盈。私股十数年来第一次分到了股息，职工的生活福利也得到了进一步的改善。这些成绩的获得，是与国营经济的领导，企业中公股的领导分不开的；是与国家在技术、资金、原料、设备供应等方面的大力扶助分不开的；是与职工劳动态度的转变，高度地发挥生产积极性分不开的。
    这也充分地说明了：私营企业中由于加入了社会主义成份，便从资本主义性质的生产关系转变为半社会主义性质的生产关系，使生产力获得了广泛的活动场所，迅速地获得提高。这就是公私合营企业优越性之所在。
    其次，我们从民生轮船公司合营后业务发展的过程中，还得出如下一些经验：第一，必须在政府和工人阶级的领导下，进行民主改革与生产改革，把旧机构遗留下来的经营落后、生产浪费、机构臃肿等致命病根，比较彻底地加以革除，并在新的基础上，建立各种进步的制度，尤其是民主管理的制度，树立为国家建设与人民需要服务的新的经营方针。这些改革，是前进的起点，都是十分必要的。第二，企业成立了新的董事会，公私代表都应尊重双方权益，发挥董事会的职权，对企业的重大问题，恰当地采取了协商的方式，加以解决。这不但提高了私股的积极性，同时，也使公私双方在国家政策与计划之下，协力合作，依靠职工，搞好了业务。第三，合理地分配盈余，既可保证生产事业的正常发展和照顾职工的生活与福利，也使投资人有利可得。这就具体而生动地体现了国家公私兼顾的经济政策，因而提高了私方经营的信心。
    解放以来，公私合营企业已有了很大的增加。这种国家资本与私人资本合作的经济的发展，对发展生产与保证社会供应，都起了良好的作用，是为国家经济建设所需要的，也是私营企业实行社会主义改造的一个重要步骤。今后随着国家经济建设事业的开展，公私合营企业无疑还会有更多更广泛的增加。因此，对这一工作，亟应引起我们重视。尤其是已经公私合营的企业，应该创造与总结更多更成熟的经验，以便交流和推广。
