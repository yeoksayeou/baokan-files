Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and Central-South China have specifically arranged forest protection and fire prevention work. The Northwest shelterbelt has afforested another 150,000 mu in the past year.

Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and Central-South China and other places are making specific arrangements for forest protection and fire prevention work. Northeast China and Inner Mongolia have entered the autumn fire prevention season. According to the characteristics of this year’s spring and summer, with more rain, lush weeds, expanded forest industry logging areas, increased operating employees, and the extension of forest railways to the primeval forest area of the Greater Khingan Mountains, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region began deploying forest protection and fire prevention work in mid-August. In response to the shortcomings in this spring's work, the Eastern Administrative Office of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region required that leagues and leagues, banners (counties) and banners (counties), and Nootoks (districts) and Nootoks (districts) establish joint defense relationships. It also pointed out that agricultural and pastoral areas should universally strengthen fire prevention work in conjunction with production to reduce casualties and the risk of fire spreading to forest areas. Appropriate revisions were also made to the sentry posts and mountain entry systems in forest areas and forest fringe areas. The People's Government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region issued instructions on September 15 to strengthen forest protection and fire prevention work, calling on cadres and the masses of the whole region to strongly support this work. Airplane patrol work also started in mid-September. The focus of this autumn's forest protection and fire prevention work in the Northeast region is on resolving the contradictions between forest protection work and the interests of the masses. The Northeast Administrative Committee stipulated in a notice issued in August that those entering the mountains within their own village or district for sideline production should be issued a mountain entry permit upon approval from the district or village people's government. Those entering the mountains outside the district, county, or province should be introduced by the district people's government to the mountain area, and the county people's government should examine and issue a mountain entry permit, allowing the mountain entry team leader to carry fire. This corrected the simple control method of closing off mountain forests during the fire prevention period in the past. At the autumn forestry work conference in Heilongjiang Province in mid-August, in addition to appropriately revising the forest protection and fire prevention system based on the situation in various places, it also emphasized the rectification of the forest protection team. Songjiang and Liaodong provinces have also issued instructions, making specific provisions on issues such as combining agricultural production, allowing the masses to enter the mountains for sideline occupations, solving the need for timber for civilian use, and implementing the responsibility system. In order to carefully arrange the winter forest protection and fire prevention work, the Central-South Administrative Committee issued forest protection and fire prevention instructions as early as August, requiring all forest areas to list fire prevention work as one of the central tasks this winter and next spring. Implement a zoning and hierarchical responsibility system and strengthen supervision and inspection work. The instructions particularly emphasized implementing the mountain forest distribution policy and earnestly handling forest rights disputes to protect private rights and give play to the enthusiasm of mountain farmers in protecting mountain forests. Hunan Province has learned from the lessons of the mountain fire that occurred in the forest area bordering Longsheng County, Guangxi, and Chengbu County in the province this spring and has proactively suggested establishing joint defense relations with Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces.

Xinhua News Agency: The shelterbelt along the Great Wall in the Northwest, which is the focus of construction, has afforested another 150,000 mu from September last year to September this year, exceeding the total afforestation area from 1950 to 1952 by 16%. The number of afforestation farms and stations along the shelterbelt has also increased from 17 last year to 31. Now, the prototype of the forest belt has been formed in some sections of the shelterbelt, and it has played a preliminary protective role for farmland and villages. In the area from Dengkou to Sanshenggong in Ningxia Province, the shifting of sand dunes has stopped in many areas due to sand control, grass cultivation, and afforestation. Gansu Province completed the 50-li long and 30-zhang wide shelterbelt in Beida River, Jiuquan County this year. Local farmers harvested 216 shi of millet and buckwheat from the 155 mu of land reclaimed and planted within the shelterbelt. Liu Zhonghe, a farmer from Shenmu County, Shaanxi Province, reaped another bumper harvest this year from the crops he planted next to the "wind barrier" (an area mixed with arbor and shrub).

In the past year, farmers along the shelterbelt of the Great Wall in the Northwest have created many new methods and experiences in afforestation, seedling cultivation, and sand dune fixation in the fight against wind and sand. The Jiecunpeng mutual aid group in Minqin County, Gansu Province, adopted the method of deep insertion with minimal exposure and rational pruning, cultivating 10,259 high-quality poplar and sand jujube seedlings in a nursery of 1.03 mu. Farmers in Jinta County covered 579 mu of sand dunes with soil this spring, sowing sand sagebrush on the sand dunes, planting trees around the sand sagebrush, protecting and restoring more than 1,800 mu of farmland, building 323 houses, and digging 9 irrigation canals. In the past eight years, 50% of the land in the eighth township of the first district of Anxi County has been submerged by sand, resulting in an annual loss of more than 800,000 jin of grain. This spring, the farmers in the township built an earth wall 172 zhang long and 1 zhang high for wind and sand prevention, enabling 800 mu of land that had been damaged by wind and sand to be restored to cultivation. Currently, the afforestation farms, afforestation stations, and farmers of all ethnic groups along the shelterbelt are actively preparing tools and seedlings and are about to start the autumn afforestation campaign.

    东北内蒙和中南等地布置护林防火工作
    西北防沙林一年来又造林十五万亩
    东北、内蒙和中南等地具体布置护林防火工作。东北和内蒙已进入秋季防火季节，内蒙自治区根据今年春夏两季雨水较多，杂草生长茂盛、森林工业伐区扩大、作业职工增多、森林铁道已延修到大兴安岭原始林区等特点，在八月中旬即着手布置护林防火工作。内蒙东部区行政公署针对今春工作中的缺点，要求盟与盟、旗（县）与旗（县）、努图克（区）与努图克（区）之间建立联防关系；同时也指出农牧地区要结合生产普遍加强防火工作，以减少人畜伤亡及火灾蔓延到林区的危险；对林区及森林边缘地区的站岗放哨和入山制度也作了适当修正。内蒙古自治区人民政府更于九月十五日发布了加强护林防火工作的指示，号召全区干部、群众大力支持这项工作。飞机巡护工作也自九月中旬开始。东北区今秋的护林防火工作，重点在解决护林工作与群众利益矛盾的问题。东北行政委员会在八月间发布的通知中规定：在本村或本区境内入山进行副业生产的，经区、村人民政府批准发给入山证，到外区外县或外省境内入山的，由本区人民政府介绍到入山区、县人民政府审查发给入山证，并准许由入山小组长带火。纠正了过去防火期间封禁山林的单纯管制办法。黑龙江省在八月中旬的秋季林业工作会议上，除根据各地情况适当地修正了护林防火的制度外，并强调了护林队的整顿工作。松江、辽东等省也都发布指示，对结合农业生产、群众入山搞副业，解决民需用材，贯彻负责制度等问题都作了具体规定。中南行政委员会为了周密布置冬季护林防火工作，早在八月间发布了护林防火指示，要求各林区在今冬明春，把防火工作列为中心任务之一。实行分区分级负责制，加强督促检查工作。指示特别强调贯彻山林分配政策及认真处理林权纠纷问题，以保障私有权益，发挥山区农民爱护山林的积极性。湖南省接受了今春广西龙胜县与该省城步县交界林区发生山火的教训，已主动建议与广东、广西、江西、四川、贵州五省建立联防关系。
    又讯：西北长城沿线重点营造的防沙林，自去年九月到今年九月共又造林十五万亩，超过一九五○年到一九五二年三年造林总数百分之十六。防沙线上的造林场、造林站等组织，也由去年的十七个增加到三十一个。现在防沙线上部分地段的林带雏形已经形成，并对农田村舍起了初步的防护作用。宁夏省磴口到三盛公一带，由于封沙、育草和造林，许多地段的流沙已停止内迁。甘肃省今年完成了酒泉县北大河五十里长、三十丈宽的防沙林带，当地农民在林带内开荒播种的一百五十五亩糜子、荞麦，就收获了二百一十六石。陕西省神木县农民刘忠和在“风帐子”（乔木灌木混植的地区）一旁种的庄稼，今年又获得丰收。
    一年来，西北区长城一带防沙线上的农民在和风沙作斗争中，创造了许多新的造林、育苗、固定流沙的方法和经验。甘肃省民勤县解存朋互助组采用深插少露、合理修剪的方法，在一亩零三厘苗圃地内育出品质优良的白杨、沙枣树苗一万零二百五十九株。金塔县农民今春用土压盖沙丘五百七十九亩，在沙丘上播种沙蒿，沙蒿周围植树，保护和恢复了农田一千八百多亩，建筑房屋三百二十三间，开挖水渠九处。安西县第一区第八乡八年来已有百分之五十的土地被沙淹没，每年损失粮食八十多万斤。今春该乡农民筑了一道一百七十二丈长、一丈高的防风防沙土墙，使被风沙侵害的八百亩田地恢复了耕种。目前防沙线上的造林场、造林站和各族农民正积极准备工具和树苗，即将开始秋季造林运动。    （新华社）
