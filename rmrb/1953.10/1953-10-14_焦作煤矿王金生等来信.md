Letter from Wang Jinsheng, Xu Nuo, Gong Mache and all workers of the tunneling team of Jiaozuo Coal Mine: Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, we have restored and developed production, completely changing the face of Jiaozuo Coal Mine. Previously, we were huddled in small coal holes, digging coal with hand picks, and each direct worker could only mine less than one and a half tons on average. Now, our underground working faces all use modern coal cutting machines. Last year, our entire mine overfulfilled the state's annual production target in ten months and twenty days, thereby improving our lives. We have fully realized that carrying out a broad, deep, and sustained production increase and economy drive is of great significance to the motherland and ourselves. Therefore, when the motherland issued the call for increased production and economy, we excitedly formulated a production increase and economy plan for the fourth quarter of this year, determined to challenge the Ma Liuhai and Lian Wanlu tunneling teams of Datong Coal Mine. Our conditions are as follows:

    Under the principle of ensuring safety and saving materials, we guarantee to tunnel 720 meters per month, which is 90 meters higher than the state plan, and strive to reach 765 meters. We guarantee to produce 7,200 tons of coal per month, and strive to reach 8,100 tons. We guarantee to save one explosive and two detonators for every meter tunneled, increasing production and saving 130,788,000 yuan per month.

    In order to achieve the above conditions, we adopt the following methods: (1) Continue to promote Ma Liuhai's advanced experience, ensure the implementation of chart management, and conscientiously implement the operation plan; (2) Ensure strict implementation of the "three fixations" (fixed position, fixed blast hole, fixed charge) system; (3) Strictly abide by safety operating procedures and strengthen the gas inspection system; ensure that the specifications of roadway engineering reach more than 95%; (4) Conscientiously implement the iron beam roof management system and the responsibility system; (5) Everyone thinks of ways, finds tricks, and gives play to collective strength. In addition, we decided to hold a technical research meeting every five days to improve everyone's technical level; hold group meetings on time, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and improve political awareness to ensure the completion and over fulfillment of the production increase and economy plan.

    焦作煤矿王金生等来信
    焦作煤矿王金生、许诺、龚马车掘进组全体工人来信：共产党和人民政府领导我们恢复和发展生产，彻底改变了焦作煤矿的面貌。以前我们窝别在小小的煤洞里，用手镐一下一下地掘煤，每一个直接工平均还掘不到一吨半；现在我们井下的工作面都是用现代化的割煤机采煤。去年我们全矿以十个月零二十天的时间，超额完成国家全年的生产任务，从而也改善了我们的生活。我们已经完全体会到开展广泛、深入而持久的增产节约竞赛，对于祖国和我们自己都具有重要意义。因此当祖国发出增产节约号召的时候，我们兴奋地订出今年第四季度的增产节约计划，决心向大同煤矿马六孩、连万禄掘进组应战。我们的条件如下：
    在保证安全和节约材料的原则下，保证全月掘进七百二十公尺，较国家计划提高九十公尺，并争取达到七百六十五公尺。保证每月产煤七千二百吨，争取达到八千零一百吨。保证每掘进一公尺节省一个炮和两个雷管，每月增产节约一亿三千零七十八万八千元。
    为了实现上述条件，我们采取以下办法：（一）继续推广马六孩的先进经验，保证执行图表管理和认真贯彻作业计划；（二）保证严格执行“三固定”（位置固定、炮眼固定、装药固定）制度；（三）严格遵守保安操作规程和加强煤气检查制度；保证巷道工程的规格达到百分之九十五以上；（四）认真执行铁梁管理顶板制和专责制；（五）大家共同想办法，找窍门，发挥集体力量。此外，我们决定每五天召开一次技术研究会议，以提高大家的技术水平；按时召开小组会，开展批评和自我批评，提高政治觉悟，以保证完成和超额完成增产节约计划。
