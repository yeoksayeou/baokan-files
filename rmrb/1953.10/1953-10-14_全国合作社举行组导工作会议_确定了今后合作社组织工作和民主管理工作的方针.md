The National Cooperative held its second organizational guidance work conference in Beijing at the end of September. This conference focused on studying and resolving some important issues in organizational work and democratic management.

Zhang Qilong, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, delivered a report at the conference. He pointed out in his report that from the first national cooperative organizational guidance work conference in May 1951 to the second quarter of 1953, the number of cooperative members nationwide had grown to over 150 million, with 32,994 grassroots supply and marketing and consumer cooperatives, and over 97,000 retail outlets. Supply and marketing operations have also expanded year by year with the development of the organization, playing a certain role in assisting state-owned commerce in expanding the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, stabilizing prices, promoting the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, improving people's lives, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The conference conducted group discussions on Zhang Qilong's report, which was finally summarized by Zhang Qilong.

Regarding organizational work, the conference pointed out that in the development of organizations nationwide, the cooperatives generally suffered from a tendency to seek quantity over quality and rapid expansion from May 1951 to the winter of 1952, because they had not grasped the principle of prudent, steady but active development. As a result, many cooperative organizations were quite chaotic. Many regions did not strictly implement the normal procedures for membership and payment of shares, and the chaotic phenomenon of "nominal members," members without shares, and shares without members was relatively common. Landlords, rich peasants, capitalists, and those under surveillance had infiltrated the cooperatives, and some cooperatives were even usurped by bad elements. Too many cooperative cadres were added, resulting in bloated organizations, overstaffing, and serious losses. In light of these circumstances, the conference believed that for a period of time to come, the guiding principle for cooperative organizational construction nationwide must be to consolidate and improve; in some areas where cooperative organizations are scarce, appropriate development may be carried out when conditions permit. In order to achieve this goal, cooperatives at all levels must improve and expand business operations, strengthen democratic management, and correct the service attitude of cadres. At the same time, organizational rectification work must be done well. At present, in terms of organizational work, it is necessary to verify members and shares, and streamline the organizational structure.

Regarding democratic management, the conference pointed out that establishing and improving the democratic management system and giving play to the supervisory role of democratic management is one of the important keys to consolidating and improving the cooperative cause. At the same time, it can enable members to learn economic management and cultivate and gradually improve their collectivist thinking. Leading cadres of cooperatives at all levels must raise their awareness of democratic management and conduct patient and repeated propaganda and education to cooperative cadres and members. At the same time, leading cadres should also regularly check the implementation of the principles of democratic management and conduct criticism and commendation.

The conference believes that in the future, it is necessary to resolutely and conscientiously strengthen inspection work and carry out publicity work regularly throughout the cooperative system.

    全国合作社举行组导工作会议
    确定了今后合作社组织工作和民主管理工作的方针
    【本报讯】全国合作社第二次组导工作会议于九月底在北京举行。这次会议着重研究并解决了组织工作、民主管理等工作中的一些重要问题。
    中华全国合作社联合总社副主任张启龙在会上作了报告。他在报告中指出：从一九五一年五月全国合作社第一次组导工作会议以来，到一九五三年第二季度为止，全国合作社社员发展到一亿五千多万人，基层供销、消费合作社达三万二千九百九十四个，零售网达九万七千多个。供销业务也随着组织的发展逐年扩大，在协助国营商业扩大城乡物资交流，稳定物价，促进工农业生产的恢复和发展，改善人民生活，巩固工农联盟等方面起了一定的作用。会议对张启龙的报告分组进行了讨论，最后由张启龙作总结。
    关于组织工作，会议指出：全国合作社在发展组织工作中由于没有掌握住谨慎、稳步而又积极的发展方针，从一九五一年五月到一九五二年冬比较普遍地发生了贪多、贪快的偏向，结果，许多合作社组织相当混乱。很多地区没有严格执行社员入社和缴纳股金的正常手续，比较普遍地出现了有“挂名社员”，有社员没股金，有股金没社员等混乱现象。地主、富农、资本家、被管制分子混入了合作社，有的合作社甚至被坏分子篡夺了领导权。合作社干部增加太多，以致机构庞大、人浮于事，发生严重的赔本现象。根据这些情况，会议认为：今后一个时期，合作社组织建设的方针，在全国范围内必须以巩固和提高为主；在某些合作社组织很少的地区，在条件具备的情况下可适当发展。为了实现这一方针，各级合作社必须改进和扩大业务经营，加强民主管理，端正干部的服务态度。同时必须做好组织方面的整理工作。目前，在组织工作方面必须核实社员和股金，并精简机构。
    关于民主管理问题，会议指出：建立与健全民主管理制度，发挥民主管理的监督作用，是巩固和提高合作社事业的重要关键之一，同时可使社员学会管理经济，培养并逐步提高其集体主义思想。各级合作社领导干部必须提高对民主管理的认识，要对合作社干部和社员经常耐心地、反复地进行宣传教育。同时，领导干部还应经常检查贯彻民主管理原则的情况，进行批评和表扬。
    会议认为：今后必须在整个合作社系统中坚决认真地加强检查工作和经常地开展宣传工作。
