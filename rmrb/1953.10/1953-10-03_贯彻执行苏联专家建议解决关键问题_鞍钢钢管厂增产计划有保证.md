Implementing Soviet Expert Advice to Solve Key Problems
Anshan Iron and Steel Steel Pipe Plant's Production Increase Plan is Guaranteed

    After the Anshan Iron and Steel Steel Pipe Plant began its production increase and thrift campaign, it earnestly implemented the advice of Soviet experts, strengthened planning management, and concentrated its efforts on solving the key problem that had prevented the production plan from being completed for eight consecutive months this year—the problem of waiting for heat in the heating furnace. This laid the foundation for over fulfilling the annual plan.

    The key problem was the unresolved issue of waiting for heat in the heating furnace. In July of this year, a Soviet expert pointed out that the issue of waiting for heat in the steel pipe plant's heating furnace was not due to objective reasons but was caused by failure to produce according to plan. He pointed out that the reason for waiting for heat was simple: if too much material was loaded into the furnace (seventeen or eighteen pieces), the furnace temperature would inevitably drop, and half of it would not burn well. At the same time, if it was loaded too densely, the steel billets would easily be pressed at the tail. Loading one furnace and resting for a while greatly reduced output and affected quality. Based on this situation, he suggested adopting a "leave three pieces empty, load nine pieces, remove one piece, load one piece" method of continuous and rhythmic operation. This would not only increase production but also greatly reduce the reject rate. However, when the Soviet expert's scientific suggestion was passed down to the workshop, it encountered serious ideological obstacles among some cadres and workers. Some people believed that the main problem of waiting for heat was the insufficient supply of gas from the gas generator. Others believed that this was how things had been done since the Japanese occupation period, and that even with more loading, the plan could not be completed, let alone with less loading. This prevented the expert's advice from being implemented.

    After the start of the production increase and thrift campaign, the plant leadership carefully studied the production situation and believed that to ensure the completion of the annual production plan, it was necessary to solve the problem that the pipe-making section had not completed the rolling output plan for eight months, that is, it was necessary to solve the key problem of waiting for heat in the heating furnace. Therefore, it convened a general Party branch committee. It carefully studied the superiority of the Soviet expert's suggestion, reviewed the irresponsible attitude towards the Soviet expert's suggestion in the past, unified the thinking of the cadres, and organized a work group to go deep into the pipe-making section to specifically help the B shift implement the expert's suggestion.

    After the work group went to the workshop, it asked the expert to provide technical explanations, mobilized the section chief, shift director, and technicians to patiently explain the benefits of the expert's suggestion to the masses, and personally demonstrated to motivate the masses. At the same time, under the leadership of the squad leader and technicians, workers were organized to hold a thirty-minute research meeting after each shift, mainly to study the experience of implementing the Soviet expert's suggestion well and the reasons for not implementing it well. Then, workers were mobilized to launch a movement to find tricks, and in more than ten days, they found more than thirty tricks, such as quick throwing, quick clamping, quick poking, quick casing, quick removal, quick adjustment, and accurate driving, accurate clamping, and uniform poking, which made the expert's suggestion more concrete. The work group used blackboard newspapers, cartoons, congratulatory letters, and instruction charts to carry out vivid and powerful propaganda, and timely boosted the morale of the workers.

    Through the above work, the expert's suggestion was thoroughly implemented, and the key problem that had not been solved for eight months was resolved. Output increased by 8.6 percent, the drawing reject rate decreased by 6.37 percent, the water leakage rate decreased by 6.16 percent, and the hourly output increased by 8.7 percent (the above figures are based on a four-day average).

    The plant is now comprehensively promoting this experience. If all three shifts can learn well, not only will they be able to make up for the losses of the previous months by the end of the year, but it will also be entirely possible to exceed the national plan.

    贯彻执行苏联专家建议解决关键问题
    鞍钢钢管厂增产计划有保证
    鞍钢钢管厂增产节约竞赛开始以后，认真贯彻执行苏联专家建议，加强计划管理，集中力量解决了今年一连八个月未完成生产计划的关键问题——加热炉待热问题，为超额完成全年计划打下了基础。
    钢管厂今年一连八个月未完成国家计划，关键问题是加热炉的待热问题没有解决。今年七月间苏联专家曾指出钢管厂加热炉的待热问题不是客观原因，是因为没有按照计划生产造成的。他指出待热的道理很简单：炉内装料太多（十七、八片），炉温必然下降，一半会烧不好，同时装的太密，钢坯又容易压尾，装一炉，休息一会儿，这样就大大降低了产量，影响了质量。根据这种情况，他建议采取“空三片，装九片，出一片，装一片，始终保持着有节奏的联系操作方法”。这不仅能提高产量，而且能大大降低废品率。但苏联专家这一科学的建议下到车间时，在部分干部和职工中碰到了严重的思想障碍。有些人认为待热主要问题是发生炉煤气供给不足；有些人认为从日本统治时期就这样干下来的，装多了还完不成计划，装少了更完不成计划。这就使专家建议得不到贯彻。
    增产节约竞赛开始后，该厂领导上仔细地研究了生产情况，认为要保证完成全年生产计划，必须解决造管工段八个月没有完成轧出量计划的问题，即必须解决加热炉待热的关键问题。于是便召开了党总支委员会。认真研究了苏联专家的建议的优越性，检查过去对苏联专家建议的不负责态度，统一了干部思想，并组织工作组深入造管工段具体帮助乙班贯彻执行专家建议。
    工作组下到车间后，即请专家作了技术上的解释，发动工段长、值班主任、技术员等耐心地向群众解释专家建议的好处，亲自动手做出样子，带动群众。同时，在班长和技术员的领导下，每一小班工作后组织工人开三十分钟的研究会，主要是研究把苏联专家建议执行得好的经验和执行得不好的原因。然后发动工人们展开了找窍门运动，十几天的功夫共找出了快扔、快挟、快捅、快套、快摘、快调整及开车准、挟的准、捅的齐等三十多个窍门，这就使专家建议更加具体化了。工作组利用黑板报、漫画、贺信、指示图板等宣传方式，进行了生动、有力的宣传，及时地鼓舞了职工情绪。
    经过上述工作，专家建议得到了彻底贯彻，使八个月来从没有解决的关键问题解决了。产量提高百分之八点六，拉废率降低百分之六点三七，水漏率降低了百分之六点一六，小时产量提高了百分之八点七（以上数字是按四天平均算的）。
    现在该厂正在全面地推广这一经验。如果三班都能很好地学习，到年底不但能补上以前几个月没有完成任务的亏欠，而且完全有可能超过国家计划。
