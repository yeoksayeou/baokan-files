    Jiangsu Provincial People's Government is actively preparing for large-scale farmland water conservancy construction throughout the province this winter and next spring. It has now completed 80% of the surveying and drilling plan. The winter farmland water conservancy projects in the province can start successively in mid-November.
    This year, Jiangsu Province will measure the low-lying areas of Dianmao in the Taihu Lake area, Jurong and Lishui areas in the Qinhuai River basin, and other seven areas for farmland water conservancy construction in terms of topographic survey, with a measurement area of approximately 3,200 square kilometers. In terms of river channel surveying, more than 680 kilometers of waterways entering the Yangtze River north of the Yangtze River and south of the Tongyang Canal, and waterways entering the sea in coastal reclamation areas will be measured. In addition, more than 770 kilometers of precision leveling and other drilling work will be carried out. The farmland water conservancy survey and drilling mission in Jiangsu Province started in March this year, and as of now, 80% of the plan has been completed, and it can be fully completed by the end of November.
    Since 1949, Jiangsu Province has conducted the management of the Yi River and Shu River and the excavation of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal, which basically eliminated flood disasters, but internal waterlogging disasters have not been eliminated, and drought disasters still often occur in some dryland mountainous areas. This year, various farmland water conservancy projects will be constructed in a planned manner to further eliminate these drought and flood disasters in the future and directly serve to increase grain production.

    江苏省人民政府
    积极准备兴修农田水利
    江苏省人民政府为积极做好今冬明春在全省大规模兴修农田水利的准备工作，现已完成了勘测钻探计划任务的百分之八十。十一月中旬，全省冬季农田水利工程可陆续开工。
    今年江苏省为兴修农田水利在地形测量方面，要测量太湖区域的淀泖低洼地区，秦淮河流域的句容溧水地区等七个地区；测量面积约三千二百多平方公里。在河道测量方面，要测量长江以北、通扬运河以南的入江水道，沿海垦区的入海水道等六百八十多公里。此外，还要进行精密水准测量七百七十多公里及其他钻探工作。江苏省这次农田水利勘测钻探任务自今年三月份开始进行，到目前止，已完成计划的百分之八十，十一月底可以全部完成。
    一九四九年以来，江苏省曾进行了导治沂河、沭河和开挖苏北灌溉总渠工程，基本上消除了洪水灾害，但内涝灾害仍未摆脱，部分旱地山区也还常发生旱灾。今年开始有计划地兴修多种多样的农田水利，以便今后进一步消除这些旱涝灾害，直接为增产粮食服务。（新华社）
