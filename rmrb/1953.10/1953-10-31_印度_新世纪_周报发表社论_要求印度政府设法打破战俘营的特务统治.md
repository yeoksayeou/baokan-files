    Indian "New Age" Weekly Publishes Editorial
    Demanding Indian Government Find a Way to Break the Special Agent Rule in POW Camps
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 29th: The "New Age" weekly published an editorial on October 25th stating, "The facts that have been revealed are so powerful that today no one can doubt that the so-called 'POWs refusing to listen to explanations' is entirely forced prevention of POWs from going to listen to explanations."

    The editorial continued: "For this purpose, Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee agents, with the active encouragement and assistance of the 'United Nations Command,' have established a reign of terror in the POW camps. A small number of POWs who broke through the blockade of the American running dogs and demanded repatriation have thoroughly exposed this reign of terror and told the world that a large number of POWs are willing to return to their homeland if they could listen to explanations.

    "Therefore, the so-called 'POWs refusing to listen to explanations' is an action that deliberately sabotages the entire work of implementing the armistice agreement. One naturally has to ask: Is it to be allowed that Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee agents, indulged by the 'United Nations Command,' should sabotage the explanation work agreed upon by all parties concerned in the Korean War?"

    The editorial wrote: "Regrettably, the Swedish and Swiss representatives of the Indian Custodial Forces and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, instead of raising and answering this real question, wavered because the United States instructed them to raise the question of whether or not to use force against POWs to make them listen to explanations.

    "It is precisely because of the negative answer to this question—that is, the answer from the Indian, Swedish, and Swiss members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which helped the 'United Nations Command' because it concealed the real force being used in the POW camps—that the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has reached a deadlock."

    The editorial wrote: "Therefore, we demand that the Indian government, for the sake of the humanitarian interests on which the custodial forces' refusal to use force against POWs is based, should take effective steps by all possible means to ensure that the reign of terror in the POW camps is immediately terminated so that the POWs can exercise their right to repatriation."

    印度“新世纪”周报发表社论
    要求印度政府设法打破战俘营的特务统治
    【新华社新德里二十九日电】“新世纪”周报在十月二十五日发表社论说：“已经透露的事实是这样有力，今天已没有一个人还能够怀疑所谓‘战俘拒绝听取解释’完全是强迫阻止战俘前往听取解释。”
    社论继续说：“为了这个目的，国民党和李承晚特务在‘联军司令部’的积极鼓励和协助下，在战俘营内建立了恐怖统治。少数冲破美国走狗的封锁线要求遣返的战俘已经把这种恐怖统治彻底揭露出来，并且告诉全世界：大批战俘是愿意回到他们的祖国的，如果他们能够听取解释的话。
    “因此，所谓‘战俘拒绝听取解释’是故意破坏实施停战协定的整个工作的行动。人们自然要问：是不是要让在‘联军司令部’纵容下的国民党和李承晚特务来破坏朝鲜战争有关方面一致同意的解释工作呢？”
    社论写道：“令人遗憾的是，印度看管军和中立国遣返委员会的瑞典和瑞士代表不是提出和答复这个真正的问题，却因美国授意提出的是否应对战俘使用武力以使他们听取解释的问题而动摇起来。
    “正是由于对这个问题的否定的答复——即中立国遣返委员会的印度、瑞典及瑞士委员们的答复，这个答复帮助了‘联军司令部’，因为它掩盖了战俘营中正在使用的真正的武力——中立国遣返委员会的工作才陷入僵局。”
    社论写道：“因此，我们要求印度政府，为了看管部队拒绝对战俘使用武力所依据的人道主义的利益，印度政府应当通过一切可能办法，采取有效步骤，务必立即终止战俘营内的恐怖统治，使战俘能够行使他们的遣返权利。”
