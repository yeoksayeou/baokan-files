Xinhua News Agency, 4th: A delegation from the Japanese "Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade" visited Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, on the morning of the 3rd. That evening, Chairman Nan Hanchen hosted a banquet for the delegation.

Invited to the banquet were: Masanosuke Ikeda, head of the Japanese "Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade" delegation, deputy heads Natsuo Eto, Toshio Tanaka, Koichi Nakamura, and all members of the delegation.

Also invited to the banquet were Japanese peace activists Togo Kameda and Kanyaemon Nakamura.

Present to accompany them were: Ji Chaoding, Secretary-General of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade; Xie Xiaonai, Director of the Liaison Department; Lu Xuzhang, Manager of the China National Import and Export Corporation; Ni Weiting, Deputy Manager; and Zhan Wu, Deputy General Manager of the Bank of China, and others.

Nan Hanchen spoke at the beginning of the banquet, saying: We are willing to establish normal trade relations with Japan and all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit; at the same time, we also know that the peace-loving Japanese people and far-sighted Japanese entrepreneurs are looking forward to trading with China. However, due to the "embargo" and "blockade" policies adopted by the American and Japanese reactionaries against Sino-Japanese trade, as well as other unreasonable obstructions, Sino-Japanese trade has not been smoothly developed to this day. We believe that as long as those in Japan who are enthusiastic about Sino-Japanese trade are truly determined to shatter the obstruction of the American and Japanese reactionaries and work hard for this, Sino-Japanese trade can be developed.

Masanosuke Ikeda then delivered a reply, saying that he fully agreed with Chairman Nan Hanchen's words and expressed his willingness to work to promote Sino-Japanese friendship and trade, and to realize the invitation of a delegation from the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to Japan in the near future. He finally added that the new spirit shown by the Chinese people surprised and deeply respected him.

Japanese businessman Koichi Uda then said: Production should serve peace and oppose war. In recent years, Japan has deeply felt the pain of war. He felt extremely honored to be able to see the new China of the working people with his own eyes.

At the end of the banquet, all members of the Japanese "Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade" delegation stood up and shouted: Long live the People's Republic of China!

    南汉宸设宴招待代表团全体团员
    【新华社四日讯】日本“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”代表团，于三日上午拜访中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸。当日晚，南汉宸主席设宴招待代表团。
    应邀参加宴会的有：日本“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”代表团团长池田正之辅、副团长江藤夏雄、田中稔男、中村高一和全体团员。
    应邀参加宴会的有日本和平人士龟田东伍及中村翫右卫门。
    出席作陪的有：中国国际贸易促进委员会秘书长冀朝鼎、联络部部长谢筱乃，中国进出口公司经理卢绪章、副经理倪蔚廷和中国银行副总经理詹武等。
    南汉宸在宴会开始时讲话，他说：我们愿意在平等互利的基础上和日本及一切国家建立正常的贸易关系；同时我们也知道，爱好和平的日本人民和日本有远见的企业家，都盼望和中国进行贸易。但是，由于美日反动派对中日贸易采取了“禁运”、“封锁”政策以及其他种种无理阻挠，以致中日贸易到今天为止，还没有顺利展开。我们相信，只要日本热心于中日贸易的人士真正有决心粉碎美日反动派的阻挠并为此而努力，中日贸易是可以开展的。
    池田正之辅接着致答辞，他表示完全同意南汉宸主席的话，表示愿意为促进中日友好和贸易，为最近期间内实现邀请中国人民政治协商会议代表团到日本而努力。他最后并说，中国人民所表现的崭新姿态，使他感到惊奇和无限尊敬。
    日本实业家宇田耕一接着说：生产应服务于和平而反对战争，几年来日本已深深感到战争的痛苦。他对于能亲眼看到劳动人民的新中国而感到无上光荣。
    宴会结束时，日本“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”代表团全体人员起立高呼：中华人民共和国万岁！
