Central-South Region Higher Industrial Schools Universally Revise Teaching Plans, Steadily Carry Out Teaching Reform

The higher industrial schools in the Central-South region, implementing the spirit of the National Higher Industrial Schools Administrative Conference, are universally revising their teaching plans, further overcoming the phenomenon of being rushed and chaotic, and steadily carrying out teaching reform work.

Because the restructuring of departments in higher industrial schools in the Central-South region has not yet been completed, the start of the semester will be delayed until mid-to-late October. South China Institute of Technology, Central-South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Wuhan University Water Conservancy College, and Wuhan River Transportation College have all conveyed the important reports and resolutions of the National Higher Industrial Schools Administrative Conference to their teachers. Huazhong Institute of Technology and Central-South Civil Engineering and Architectural Institute, due to the temporary inability to gather teachers, have conveyed the information at preparatory committee meetings or expanded college affairs meetings. Huazhong Institute of Technology also gave two reports to more than one hundred newly arrived teaching assistants. After listening to the reports and resolutions, the teachers of each school conducted detailed discussions in light of the specific conditions of their schools. According to the spirit of the conference, each school first carried out the revision of the teaching plan. At present, teachers are preparing teaching outlines based on the teaching plans. South China Institute of Technology, Central-South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Wuhan University Water Conservancy College, and other schools have completed the revision of their teaching plans. Huazhong Institute of Technology has also revised the teaching plan for the "Power Generation, Distribution Network and Combined Transmission System" major. In the process of revising the teaching plans, teachers have put forward requirements suitable for the specific conditions of each school's teaching staff and students, reduced the total teaching hours, and appropriately adjusted the curriculum. When revising the teaching plan for the "River Structure and Hydropower Station Hydraulic Structures" major, teachers at Wuhan University Water Conservancy College re-studied the teaching plan for similar majors in the Soviet Union, and gained a further understanding of the training objectives for this type of major. They realized that the teaching plan is an organic combination of various teaching procedures and courses under the goal of cultivating professional talents to meet the needs of national construction. Therefore, when adding, subtracting, or changing teaching procedures or courses, they can consider the impact on other teaching procedures or other courses from multiple perspectives. Based on the specific conditions of Wuhan University Water Conservancy College, such as teachers, equipment, and student level, they made a more detailed analysis of the proportion of various teaching procedures, course systems, and teaching methods. Zhang Ruijin, the president of the college, said: After this revision, the phenomenon of being rushed and chaotic caused by the excessive burden on teachers and students can basically be avoided. He said: The revised teaching plan is consistent with the Soviet teaching plan in the direction of training talents, but the requirements are different.

Since the National Higher Industrial Schools Administrative Conference clarified the principles for setting up majors and professional courses, higher industrial colleges in the Central-South region can proceed from actual conditions when considering majors and professional courses. In the past, South China Institute of Technology had too many majors and the curriculum was too heavy. Now, the twenty-nine majors in the last academic year have been reduced to thirteen, and the professional courses have also been streamlined. At Huazhong Institute of Technology, due to the difficulty of teachers in the mechanical field, some courses that are currently not able to be offered are temporarily suspended. Courses that are difficult to offer but must be offered are jointly taught by several teachers. Each college has also reduced or merged some specialized courses depending on the conditions of the teaching staff and the needs. Necessary streamlining, merging, or modification of the courses in the specialized courses has also been done. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中南区各高等工业学校
    普遍修订教学计划稳步进行教学改革
    中南区各高等工业学校贯彻全国高等工业学校行政会议精神，普遍修订教学计划，进一步克服忙乱现象，稳步进行教学改革工作。
    中南区各高等工业学校由于院系调整工作尚未结束，将延迟至十月中下旬开学，华南工学院、中南矿冶学院、武汉大学水利学院和武汉河运学院都分别向教师们传达了全国高等工业学校行政会议的重要报告和决议。华中工学院和中南土木建筑学院因教师一时不能集中，已在筹备委员会议或院务扩大会议上先行传达。华中工学院还对新来助教一百多人作过两次报告。各院校教师在听了传达报告和决议之后，都结合学校具体情况作了细致的讨论。各校根据会议精神，首先进行了教学计划的修订工作。目前，教师们正在分别根据教学计划编制教学大纲。华南工学院、中南矿冶学院、武汉大学水利学院等校修订教学计划工作已经完成，华中工学院也已修订了“发电配电网及联合输电系统”专业的教学计划。教师们在修订教学计划过程中，提出了适合各校师资和学生等具体条件的要求，减少了教学总时数，适当调整了课程。武汉大学水利学院的教师在修订“河川结构及水电站水工建筑”专业教学计划时，重新学习了苏联同类专业的教学计划，对这类专业的培养目标有了进一步的认识。他们体会到教学计划是在适应国家建设需要培养专业人材的目标之下，各个教学程序以及各个课程间的有机组合。因此他们在增减或变更教学程序或课程的时候，就能从多方面考虑对其他教学程序或其他课程的影响，他们根据武汉大学水利学院的师资、设备、学生程度等具体情况，对各个教学程序、课程系统以及教学方式所占的分量作了比较细致的分析。该院院长张瑞瑾说：经过这次修订，基本上可以避免师生们因负担过重所引起的忙乱现象。他说：修订以后的教学计划和苏联教学计划培养人材的方向是一致的，但要求有所不同。
    由于全国高等工业学校行政会议明确了专业设置和专业课程设置的原则，中南各高等工科院校在考虑专业及专业课程时都能从实际情况出发。华南工学院过去设置专业太多，课程安排过重，现已将上学年二十九个专业减少为十三个专业，专业课程也都有所精简。华中工学院在机械方面的专业由于师资困难，有些课程目前还没有力量开设的就暂时停开，开课有困难而又必须开的课程就由几位教师共同担任。各院校还视师资条件和需要情况缩减或合并了一些专修科，对于专修科的课程也作了必要的精简、合并或修正。（新华社）
