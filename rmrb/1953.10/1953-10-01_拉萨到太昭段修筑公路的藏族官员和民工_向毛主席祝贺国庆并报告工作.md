    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 26th: As National Day approaches, Tengba and Jiangbakezhu, the commanders of the road construction headquarters for the Lhasa-Tachao section of the Kangzang Highway and officials of the Tibetan local government, together with all the Tibetan officials and laborers of this section, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to congratulate him on National Day and report on their work achievements and joyful labor life.
    The letter first extended congratulations to Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups, on National Day. Then it reported: This spring, the Dalai Lama, in accordance with the provisions of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet and following your instructions and those of the Central People's Government, sent us to participate in the construction of the Kangzang Highway. We are very happy to be building the highway on the land of our own hometowns, and we are deeply grateful for your concern for the Tibetan people. Under the guidance and help of the Dalai Lama, the leaders of the Tibet Military Region, and the People's Liberation Army, we have united as one, overcome all difficulties, and achieved great success. By the end of August, we had completed more than one million cubic meters of earthwork and stonework, culverts, retaining walls, and other projects.
    The letter specifically mentioned the assistance provided by the People's Liberation Army in various aspects, saying: The People's Liberation Army has set up mobile supply stations in various project sections, providing us with a large amount of daily necessities such as zanba, tea, butter, salt, clothes, and towels at cost prices. The doctors of the People's Liberation Army also often come to the construction site to treat us. In June (Tibetan calendar), our wages were increased by nearly double, and our living conditions have improved.
    The letter talked about their glorious and joyful working life, saying: When we work every day, our songs never cease; after work, everyone gathers happily to dance. Many labor models and model teams have emerged among us. We hang the red flag of the model team on top of the tent and light willow branches to celebrate.
    The letter finally stated: We must unite closely with the People's Liberation Army and work together. Strive to complete the highway as soon as possible and go to Beijing by car to see you.
