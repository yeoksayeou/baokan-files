    Continue to Deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
    Lin Chao
    October 25th of this year marks the third anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' entry into Korea to fight.
    People all over the world have seen what great victories the Chinese People's Volunteers have achieved in their heroic struggle against American aggression alongside the Korean people over the past three years, and what a profound impact this victory has had on the situation in the Far East and the world.
    All the people of China, all the people of Korea, and all progressive mankind regard the glorious Chinese People's Volunteers, who have established great merits in the sacred cause of resisting America and aiding Korea, with infinite gratitude and respect. Comrade Malenkov said: "The lofty achievements of the glorious Chinese People's Volunteers who went to aid the Korean people will never be forgotten. Not only the great Chinese people, but all progressive mankind is proud of this achievement." Comrade Malenkov's words vividly express the feelings of all progressive mankind towards the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    The brilliant achievements of the heroic struggle made by the Chinese People's Volunteers together with the Korean People's Army are: First, they drove the enemy back to the 38th parallel and shattered the U.S. imperialists' wild plan to occupy all of Korea, thereby guaranteeing Korea's independence and China's security. Second, they annihilated a large number of enemy effectives and exposed the myth of the American army's "invincibility." From the beginning of the Korean War to the armistice, the Korean-Chinese People's Armies killed, wounded, and captured a total of 1,093,000 enemy soldiers, including 397,000 American soldiers. The U.S. military's losses exceeded the total casualties of the U.S. military in World War I (330,000), equivalent to more than 40% of the total U.S. military casualties in World War II (920,000). Moreover, the United States lost its long-term trained elite forces. Third, it strengthened our own forces and gained rich experience in modern warfare with the American invading forces. This experience is very valuable to us. Fourth, it educated and inspired the people of the whole country, raised the political consciousness of the people of the whole country, and promoted the country's construction cause. At the same time, it also inspired the people of the world and strengthened their confidence and determination to oppose aggression and defend peace. Fifth, on the basis of military victory, it insisted on more than two years of armistice negotiations, forcing the enemy to accept the armistice, thereby defending peace in the Far East and giving a very effective blow to the U.S. imperialists' frenzy to launch a new war.
    The fact that the Chinese people's assistance to the Korean people has achieved great victory powerfully proves that the powerful and existing People's Republic of China has become a strong fortress in the struggle of the oppressed people of the East for freedom and independence and for the defense of peace, proving that the imperialist forces can no longer stop the advance of the Korean people, the Chinese people, and the people of Asian countries. The U.S. imperialists were unwilling to recognize this objective fact, and as a result, they suffered greatly in their aggression against Korea.
    The current situation is: although the Korean War has stopped, the U.S. imperialists are not reconciled to their defeat. They are still continuing to undermine the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, obstruct the convening of political conferences and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and carry out new conspiracies in the Far East to obstruct the easing of the Far East situation.
    The U.S. imperialists' conspiracies are mainly manifested in the following facts:
    First, after the Korean armistice, the U.S. government quickly signed a so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Syngman Rhee gang, stipulating the "right of the United States to deploy U.S. land, air, and sea forces within and around the territory of the Republic of Korea," attempting to station troops in South Korea for a long time; and stipulated that the United States has an obligation to assist Syngman Rhee in carrying out war. These provisions are in complete violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and their purpose is only to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. In addition, the United States also gathered fifteen accomplices in the aggression against Korea and the United States to issue a "declaration" to threaten the people of China and Korea and the people of the world with the resumption and expansion of the war, and to continue to create a tense situation.
    Second, the United States has agreed with the Syngman Rhee gang on a plan to withdraw from the political conference ninety days after the political conference is convened, intending to undermine the political conference through unilateral action. The United States is stubbornly opposed to the participation of neutral countries related to the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue in the political conference, so that the political conference repeats the form of the Panmunjom negotiations, in order to obstruct the political conference from achieving positive results in the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.
    Third, the United States is colluding with the Syngman Rhee gang to threaten and oppress the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, obstruct the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission from exercising its functions, and through the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gang agents employed by the United States who have sneaked into the prisoner-of-war camps, frantically sabotage the explanation work carried out by the Korean-Chinese side for the captured personnel of the Korean-Chinese army. The agents have established a reign of terror in the prisoner-of-war camps with the direct assistance of the U.S. military, using force to prevent prisoners of war from listening to explanations, and at the same time using barbaric slaughter methods to deal with prisoners of war who demand repatriation. Some prisoners of war who demanded repatriation were dissected and had their hearts dug out, and some were locked in dungeons. Because the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has not taken effective measures to deal with the lawless sabotage activities of the agents, the explanation work of the Korean-Chinese side has only been carried out for seven hours since it began on October 15, and then was forced to be interrupted. These criminal acts of the United States have seriously violated the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," which is a component of the Armistice Agreement, and seriously threaten the future of the Korean armistice.
    Fourth, U.S. imperialism continues to occupy our territory of Taiwan and actively assists the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in disrupting and threatening the security of our coast. The action of the remnant bandits harassing Dongshan Island in July this year is an example. This harassment action was carried out entirely under the plan of the U.S. military advisory group. The U.S. Navy and Air Force are now increasingly frequently entering and leaving Taiwan ports and bases.
    Fifth, the U.S. government has decided to provide 785 million U.S. dollars in aid to France to invade Vietnam, in order to continue to prolong and expand the Vietnam War. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles openly threatened the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries with expanding the Vietnam War in his speech on September 2.
    Sixth, the U.S. government is stepping up its activities to rearm Japan. According to foreign news agency reports, Ikeda, the personal representative of Japanese reactionary government Prime Minister Yoshida, is in Washington discussing with the U.S. government a plan to expand the Japanese army to 350,000 men within five years.
    These criminal activities of the U.S. imperialists have caused great difficulties for the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the convening of political conferences, thus making the Armistice Agreement face the danger of being completely destroyed, and making the situation in the Far East continue to maintain a tense state, and hiding new dangers.
    In this situation, in order to completely smash the various criminal conspiracies of the U.S. imperialists, ensure the thorough implementation of the Armistice Agreement, strive for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and further ease the situation in the Far East, it is clear that we must still carry out a serious struggle.
    Before the Korean issue is truly resolved peacefully, the Chinese People's Volunteers must still, together with the Korean people, undertake the arduous task of ensuring the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and preventing the enemy's re-aggression.
    Therefore, the people of our country must continue to deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea in order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and aid the Korean people, and strive for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.
    How to continue to deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea?
    First, it is necessary to continue to carry out propaganda and education work on resisting America and aiding Korea among the people of the whole country in combination with various tasks. Over the past three years, the propaganda and education work on resisting America and aiding Korea that we have carried out among the people of the whole country has achieved great results and has played a huge role in raising the people's political consciousness. In the future, we must further consolidate and develop this achievement. The idea that since the Korean War has stopped, the propaganda and education work of resisting America and aiding Korea can be stopped or relaxed is very wrong. We should always expose the aggressive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism to the broad masses of the people, educate the people to recognize that opposing U.S. aggression will be a long-term and complex struggle, and prevent any slack and paralysis thinking. We should use the historical experience of resisting America and aiding Korea to educate every Chinese people, so that they understand how brutal, barbaric, and shameless U.S. imperialism is, understand how and why we were able to defeat the fierce U.S. imperialism, understand the great strength of our country and its glorious position in the international arena, so that we can further raise the patriotism and internationalism awareness of the people of the whole country, and encourage the people of the whole country to strive more actively to build our beloved motherland, and to gradually transition our country to a socialist society.
    Second, in order to continue to support the Chinese People's Volunteers with practical actions, the people of the whole country should strive to increase production, practice strict economy, and ensure the completion of the national construction plan. This is the most effective way for us to support the volunteers. Over the past three years, the people of the whole country have made many significant contributions to support our beloved volunteers. These contributions have greatly strengthened the strength of the volunteers and helped them achieve great victories. In the future, we should still regard supporting the volunteers as a top priority. As long as the Korean issue has not been resolved peacefully and the volunteers are still in Korea, we must use every means to meet their needs in order to help them complete their glorious tasks.
    Third, we must strive to consolidate national defense in order to ensure national security. Over the past three years, with the development of the movement to resist America and aid Korea, our national defense forces have been greatly strengthened. We now not only have a strong army, but also have begun to establish a strong air force and artillery force. Now even the enemy has to admit that we are a military power. In the future, our task is to further promote our national defense construction on the existing basis, and this also requires the concerted efforts of the people of the whole country.
    Fourth, we must further do a good job in helping and giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary soldiers and the families of martyrs. This is a work of great political importance, and all localities must regularly check and improve this work.
    Fifth, the Chinese people and the Korean people have forged unbreakable brotherly friendship and unity in the common struggle against American aggression. In the future, we must continue to consolidate and develop this friendship and unity. We must actively assist the Korean people in carrying out restoration work, and together with the Korean people, carry out a resolute struggle for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the defense of peace in the Far East.

    继续深入地开展抗美援朝运动
    林朝
    今年十月二十五日是中国人民志愿军出国作战的三周年。
    全世界的人民都已看见：中国人民志愿军三年来和朝鲜人民在一起所作的反抗美国侵略的英雄斗争已获得了多么伟大的胜利，这一胜利对于远东和世界局势已发生了多么深刻的影响。
    全中国人民、全朝鲜人民和全世界一切进步人类，都以无限感激和尊敬的心情来看待在抗美援朝的神圣事业中树立了伟大功勋的光荣的中国人民志愿军。马林科夫同志说：“前往援助朝鲜人民的、光荣的中国人民志愿军的崇高功绩，是永远不会被人们忘记的。不仅是伟大的中国人民，而且全体进步人类都为这种功绩而骄傲。”马林科夫同志的这段话生动地表达了全体进步人类对中国人民志愿军的心情。
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一起所作的英雄斗争的光辉成果就是：第一，把敌人打退到三八线，粉碎了美帝国主义侵占全朝鲜的狂妄计划，从而保障了朝鲜的独立和中国的安全。第二，歼灭了敌人大量的有生力量，戳穿了美国军队“不可战胜”的神话。从朝鲜战争开始到停战时止，朝中人民军队共打死、打伤和俘虏敌人一百零九万三千多人，其中美军三十九万七千多人。美军的损失超过第一次世界大战中美军的全部伤亡（三十三万多人），相当于第二次世界大战中美军伤亡总数（九十二万多人）百分之四十以上。并且美国所损失的都是它长期培养的精锐力量。第三，壮大了自己的力量，取得了与美国侵略军进行现代化作战的丰富经验，这些经验对于我们是非常宝贵的。第四，教育和鼓舞了全国人民，提高了全国人民的政治觉悟，推进了国家的建设事业。同时也鼓舞了全世界人民，加强了他们反对侵略和保卫和平的信心和决心。第五，在军事胜利的基础上，坚持进行了两年多的停战谈判，迫使敌人接受了停战，从而捍卫住了远东的和平，给了美帝国主义发动新战争的狂热以非常有效的打击。
    中国人民援助朝鲜人民获得伟大胜利的事实，有力地证明了强大存在着的中华人民共和国已成为东方被压迫人民争取自由与独立和保卫和平斗争中的坚强堡垒，证明了帝国主义势力已无法阻止朝鲜人民、中国人民和亚洲各国人民的前进。美帝国主义不愿意认识这一客观事实，结果使自己在侵略朝鲜中大吃了苦头。
    目前的形势是：朝鲜战争虽然已经停止，但美帝国主义并不甘心于自己的失败，它仍在继续破坏朝鲜停战协定的实施，阻挠政治会议的召开和朝鲜问题的和平解决，并在远东进行新的阴谋活动，阻挠远东局势的缓和。
    美帝国主义的阴谋活动主要表现在下面一些事实上：
    第一，美国政府在朝鲜停战后，很快即与李承晚匪帮签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，规定了美国在“大韩民国领土以内及其周围部署美国陆、空、海部队的权利”，企图长期驻军南朝鲜；并规定了美国有协助李承晚进行战争的义务。这些规定是完全违反朝鲜停战协定的，其目的只是为了阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。此外美国并纠合了十五个侵朝帮凶国家和美国一起发表了一个“宣言”，以重新恢复和扩大战争来威胁中朝两国人民和世界人民，继续制造紧张局势。
    第二，美国已与李承晚匪帮商定了一个在政治会议召开九十天后退出政治会议的计划，预谋以片面行动破坏政治会议。美国正在顽固地反对与和平解决朝鲜问题有关的中立国家参加政治会议，好使政治会议重复板门店谈判的形式，来阻挠政治会议在和平解决朝鲜问题上获得积极的成果。
    第三，美国正与李承晚匪帮勾结一起，威胁和压迫中立国遣返委员会，阻挠中立国遣返委员会行使其职权，并通过美国所雇佣的、潜入战俘营中的李承晚、蒋介石匪帮的特务，疯狂破坏朝中方面对朝中军队被俘人员所进行的解释工作。特务们已在美军的直接帮助下，在战俘营中建立了恐怖的统治，以武力阻止战俘听取解释，同时以野蛮的屠杀手段对付要求遣返的战俘，有的要求遣返的战俘竟被剖胸挖心，有的被关进土牢。由于中立国遣返委员会对特务分子的这种无法无天的破坏活动延不采取有效的处置办法，以至朝中方面的解释工作自十月十五日开始以来仅进行了七小时，以后即被迫中断。美国方面的这些罪恶行为，严重地破坏了停战协定的组成部分“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，严重地威胁着朝鲜停战的前途。
    第四，美帝国主义继续侵占着我国领土台湾，并积极援助蒋介石残余匪帮扰乱和威胁我国沿海的安全。今年七月间残匪骚扰我东山岛的行动即是一个例子，这一骚扰行动完全是在美国军事顾问团的计划下进行的。美国海军和空军现在愈来愈频繁地进出台湾海港和基地。
    第五，美国政府已决定以七亿八千五百万美元的款项援助法国侵略越南，以便继续延长和扩大越南战争。美国国务卿杜勒斯在其九月二日的演说中并公然以扩大越南战争来恐吓中国人民和亚洲各国人民。
    第六，美国政府正加紧进行重新武装日本的活动，据外国通讯社消息称，日本反动政府首相吉田的私人代表池田正在华盛顿与美国政府商谈一项在五年内要把日本陆军扩充至三十五万人的计划。
    美帝国主义的这些罪恶活动，已使朝鲜停战协定的实施和政治会议的召开遭遇到极大的困难，因而使停战协定面临着被完全破坏的危险，并使远东局势继续保持着紧张状态，和隐伏着新的危险。
    在这种形势下，为了彻底击破美帝国主义的各种罪恶阴谋，保障停战协定的彻底实施和争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，并进一步缓和远东局势，显然我们还必须进行严重的斗争。
    在朝鲜问题真正获得和平解决前，中国人民志愿军仍然必须和朝鲜人民一道，担负起保障朝鲜停战协定的实施和防止敌人侵略再起的艰巨任务。
    因此，我们全国人民就必须继续深入地开展抗美援朝运动，以支持中国人民志愿军和援助朝鲜人民，并为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决而努力。
    怎样继续深入地开展抗美援朝运动呢？
    第一，必须结合各项工作继续在全国人民中间进行抗美援朝的宣传教育工作。过去三年来，我们在全国人民中间所进行的抗美援朝的宣传教育工作已取得了很大的成绩，对于提高人民的政治觉悟起了巨大的作用。今后必须把这种成果更加巩固和发扬起来。那种认为朝鲜战争既然已经停止，抗美援朝的宣传教育工作就可以停止或放松的想法是非常错误的。我们应当经常地向广大人民揭露美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，教育人民认识反对美国侵略将是一个长期的复杂的斗争，防止任何松懈麻痹的思想。应当用抗美援朝的历史经验去教育每一个中国人民，使他们了解美帝国主义是如何的残暴、野蛮和无耻，了解我们是怎样和为什么能够战胜了凶恶的美帝国主义的，了解我们国家所具有的伟大力量和目前在国际上所处的光荣地位，这样就可以更加提高全国人民的爱国主义和国际主义的觉悟，鼓舞全国人民更加积极地为建设我们可爱的祖国，为使我们国家逐步过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗。
    第二，为了继续用实际行动支持中国人民志愿军，全国人民应当努力增加生产，厉行节约，保证完成国家的建设计划，这是我们支持志愿军的最有效的方法。过去三年来，全国人民为了支持我们亲爱的志愿军，已经作了许多重大的贡献，这些贡献大大增强了志愿军的力量，帮助他们取得了伟大的胜利。今后我们仍然应当把支持志愿军看作是一项头等重要的任务，只要朝鲜问题还未获得和平解决，志愿军还留在朝鲜，我们就必须用一切办法满足他们的需要，以帮助他们完成自己的光荣任务。
    第三，必须努力巩固国防，以保障国家的安全。过去三年来，随着抗美援朝运动的发展，我们的国防力量已得到极大的加强，我们现在不但已有一支强大的陆军，而且已开始建立起强大的空军和炮兵部队。现在敌人也不得不承认我们已是一个军事强国。今后我们的任务就是在已有的基础上更加把我们的国防建设推向前进，在这方面也需要全国人民的一致努力。
    第四，必须进一步做好帮助和优待革命军人家属和烈士家属的工作。这是一项有极大政治重要性的工作，各地必须经常检查和改进这一工作。
    第五，中国人民和朝鲜人民已经在反对美国侵略的共同斗争中结成了牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊和团结，今后我们必须继续巩固和发展这种友谊和团结。我们必须积极援助朝鲜人民进行恢复工作，并和朝鲜人民一起共同为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决和保卫远东和平而进行坚决的奋斗。
