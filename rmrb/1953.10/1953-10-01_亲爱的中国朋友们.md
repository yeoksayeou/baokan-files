    Dear Chinese Friends
    Soviet Composer
    Stalin Prize Winner T. Shostakovich

    Dear friends!
    Please allow me, on behalf of the musicians of the Soviet Union, to warmly congratulate you on the glorious fourth anniversary of the great victory of the Chinese people. The liberation of China from imperialism and feudal oppression and the creation of the People's Republic of China have filled the hearts of working people all over the world with joy.
    Inspired by your historic victory, millions upon millions of peace defenders are increasingly devoting their efforts to the struggle to maintain world peace.
    Honest people all over the world are filled with deep sympathy for the great Chinese people and unanimously demand the recognition of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.
    Like all Soviet people, I feel infinitely happy that the friendship between the people of our two great countries is becoming stronger and more unbreakable day by day, and that the multifaceted economic and cultural ties between our two great countries are becoming closer and wider day by day.
    As a representative of Soviet musical culture, I am particularly pleased with the increasingly solid friendship and cooperation between the musical and cultural workers of our two friendly countries.
    Soviet composers are enthusiastically preparing themes drawn from Chinese classical and folk music, and Soviet musicians are performing the works of Chinese composers with love.
    At the same time, I am also pleased to feel that the works of the classical writers of our Russian national music and the works of modern Soviet composers, including all the fraternal member republics, have become increasingly popular among the Chinese people.
    I firmly believe that our friendship will develop and strengthen year by year along with the national strength of the People's Republic of China, the welfare of the Chinese people, and their material and spiritual wealth.
    Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!
    Long live the friendship of the people of the world!

    亲爱的中国朋友们
    苏联作曲家
    斯大林奖金获得者  特·萧斯塔科维奇 亲爱的朋友们！
    请容许我代表苏联的音乐家们热烈地向你们祝贺伟大的中国人民辉煌胜利的四周年节日。中国从帝国主义和封建压迫下获得的解放以及中华人民共和国的创建，使全世界劳动人民的心中产生了欢悦。
    被你们的历史性胜利所鼓舞的千千万万的和平保卫者，正日益奋励地把他们的努力倾注在为维持全世界和平的斗争上面。
    全世界的正直人们都充满着对伟大的中国人民的深切的同情，并且一致要求承认中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。
    我和所有的苏联人一样，感到无限欢快的是，我们两大国人民之间的友谊正一天天地成为更加巩固和牢不可破的了，我们两大国之间的经济与文化的多方面联系正在一天天地紧密和扩大着。
    作为苏联音乐文化代表的我，对于我们两大友好国家的音乐文化工作者日益巩固起来的友谊与合作，感到特别高兴。
    苏联作曲家们正怀着极大的热情拟制着从中国的古典和民间音乐中所汲取的主题，并且苏联音乐家们也正以热爱的心情来表演中国作曲家的作品。
    同时我还愉快地感觉到，我们俄罗斯民族音乐的古典作家的作品和包括所有兄弟盟员共和国的现代苏联的作曲家们的作品在中国人民中间已成为越来越受欢迎的了。
    我深深相信：我们的友谊一定会和中华人民共和国的国力，中国人民的福利及其物质与精神的财富一起，逐年地发展和加强起来。
    中苏友好万岁！
    全世界人民友好万岁！
