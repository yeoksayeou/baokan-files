    Hebei Medical College Affiliated Hospital Has Paid Attention to Improving Environmental Hygiene
    Letter from the Hebei Medical College Affiliated Hospital: The "Abstract of Readers' Letters" column on September 20 published the criticisms of Comrades Liu Yu and Shi Fengwen regarding our hospital's lack of attention to environmental hygiene. After our inspection, the opinions raised by the readers are correct. The weeds in the yard have now been cleared, and the toilets, operating rooms, outpatient departments, wards, and other places have also been thoroughly cleaned up. We will pay attention to cleanliness at all times in the future. However, the problem of the water pit behind our hospital cannot be solved for the time being because our hospital does not have a sewer system. At present, we can only adopt temporary measures, using 666 powder or kerosene for disinfection and placing lime in the pit; when economic conditions permit in the future, we plan to dig another seepage well. As for filling the water pit and building a sewer system, it awaits the unified solution of municipal construction.

    河北医学院附属医院已注意改进环境卫生
    河北医学院附属医院来信：九月二十日“读者来信摘要”栏登载了刘钰、石奉文二同志对本院不注意环境卫生的批评。经我们检查，读者所提意见是正确的。现在院子里的杂草已经清除，厕所和手术室、门诊部、病房等处亦经切实整理，今后并将随时注意清洁。但本院后面的水坑问题，因我院没有下水道，一时不能解决。目前我们只能采用临时办法，用六六六粉或煤油消毒，并在坑内填放石灰；将来经济条件许可时，拟另凿渗水井。至于填塞水坑和建设下水道的问题，有待于市政建设的统一解决。
