    Automated Seamless Steel Tube Plant
    Hu Geng
    New China’s first large-scale automated seamless steel tube plant is about to begin production.

    Seamless steel tubes are essential materials for all sectors of the national economy. To exploit the rich treasures buried beneath our motherland, to build power plants and machinery manufacturing plants, and to manufacture locomotives, ships, etc., we must have a sufficient quantity of seamless steel tubes. In the past, China had never produced seamless steel tubes. After the seamless steel tube plant is completed and put into production, domestically produced seamless steel tubes will gradually meet the needs of the motherland’s industrial construction.

    The scale of the seamless steel tube plant is quite large. The entire production process is automated and mechanized. In the first stage of production, steel billets transported from large factories are cut by a cutting machine according to product specifications. Then, a centering machine drills a round hole in the head of the steel billet, and the billet is sent to the heating furnace by a tipping machine. During loading, the worker sits at the operating table, and with the press of a button, the tipping machine sends the steel billets into the furnace row by row. After heating, the heated steel billets are automatically sent to the piercing machine by a pushing machine for piercing. The furnace temperature is not controlled manually. Beside the heating furnace, there is an instrument panel. By simply looking at the instrument, one can know the entire temperature situation inside the furnace. If the furnace temperature needs to be raised or lowered, the auxiliary radiation controller on the heating furnace will automatically heat or lower the temperature according to people’s requirements. These instruments not only tell the person in charge of the furnace the temperature inside the furnace, but also record the temperature situation every minute and every hour throughout the day, providing the person in charge of the furnace with reference for technical management. If the gas pressure drops, the gas cutoff device will immediately cut off the gas and stop the delivery, and the signal on the instrument panel will immediately notify the operator.

    When the red-hot steel billet enters the piercing machine rolling mill track of the hot rolling section from the heating furnace, two drum-shaped large rollers immediately clamp the steel billet and rotate it. The piercing machine opposite the steel billet pierces the steel billet into a through-hole, like a shuttle. This is the first process of the hot rolling section. After the steel billet is pierced for the first time, it is then rolled and straightened by the tube rolling machine and the sizing machine, becoming a smoother semi-finished product. The rolled steel tube automatically runs to the cooling table along the roller track. At this time, the transmission of rows of long iron chains on the automatic cooling table, like a dozen giant pythons, turns back and forth, waiting to meet the red-hot steel tubes. As soon as the steel tube enters the cooling table, a baffle "bang" knocks the steel tube into the teeth of the chain, and then sends the steel tubes one by one to the straightening machine for straightening. After the straightening machine straightens the steel tubes, they are sent to the last processing section. After processing, the tubes become finished products.

    This factory is not only automated in production, but also scientific in production management. The entire factory has many signal light devices. When a problem occurs in production, the signal light immediately replaces manpower to report to the person in charge of the machine. The factory's production volume, whether it is daily or ten-day production, does not require recording personnel to record production figures. Before the steel billet is heated, it must go through the automatic weighing scale process. As soon as the steel billet is placed on it, the scale table records the production figures like sending a telegram. Moreover, the scale table automatically accumulates the numbers of each weighing.

    The automated production process of the seamless steel tube plant also brings unparalleled happiness to the operating workers. Heavy labor is no longer needed at all. On the high factory roof of the spacious factory building, there is thick lightweight glass, so no matter how strong the sun is in summer, it will not heat up the roof. More than two hundred ventilation devices installed in every corner of the factory building send cool breezes that refresh people from the air blowers in summer. In winter, the air blowers send warm air of appropriate temperature, making people feel warm. To prevent the hot air from being dry, slight steam is released into the hot air, making the workers warm and comfortable at work. In winter, the average temperature inside the factory is around 15 degrees Celsius. Strict safety equipment is installed in places with gas pipelines and electrical equipment, so workers will no longer encounter any danger in their work.

    自动化无缝钢管厂
    胡更
    新中国第一个规模巨大的自动化的无缝钢管厂就要开工生产了。
    无缝钢管是国民经济各部门不可缺少的重要器材。我们要开采埋藏在祖国地下的丰富宝藏，要建设起发电厂、机械制造厂，要制造火车头、轮船等，都必须有足够数量的无缝钢管才行。过去我国从来没有生产过无缝钢管，在无缝钢管厂竣工生产后，我国自产的无缝钢管，就将逐步满足祖国工业建设的需要。
    无缝钢管厂的规模是相当庞大的。全厂生产过程都是自动化和机械化的。生产的第一个工段，从大型厂运来的钢坯经过切断机，按照产品规格切断，然后用定心机把钢坯头上钻一圆孔，钢坯就被翻料机送到加热炉来了。在装料时，工人坐在操作台上，只要一按电钮，钢坯就被翻料机一排排地送进炉子去，加热完的钢坯就被推料机自动地送到穿孔机去穿孔了。炉子的温度不要人工来控制，在加热炉旁边有一个仪表盘，只要一看仪表，就知道炉子内温度的全部情况。如果炉温需要加高或减低，加热炉上的副射控制器就会自动地按照人们的要求加热或减低温度。这些仪表不仅能告诉炉内温度情况给掌握这个炉子的人，同时它还把一天当中每分钟每小时的温度情况，都记载下来，供给掌握这个炉子的主人在技术管理方面作参考。如果发生瓦斯压力降低时，瓦斯切断器就立刻把瓦斯切断，停止输送，仪表盘上的信号就马上通知主人。
    当火红的钢坯从加热炉进入热轧工段的穿孔机轧辊道时，两个鼓式的大辊子立刻就把钢坯夹起来并旋转着，钢坯对面的穿孔机像穿梭似地把钢坯穿成一个透心圆孔。这是热轧工段的第一个工序。钢坯经过第一次穿孔，再经过轧管机和均整机的压延和均整后，就变成较光滑的半成品了。轧出的钢管，随着辊道，自动地跑向冷却台。这时自动冷却台的一排排长铁链子的传动器，像十余只巨蟒似的来回翻转，等待着和火红的钢管会见。当钢管刚一进入冷却台时，一个挡板“崩”的一下就把钢管拨进链子的牙内，随着就把一根一根的钢管送到矫正机矫正了。矫正机把钢管矫正后，就送到最后一个加工工段，管子经过加工后，就成为成品了。
    这个工厂不仅在生产上是自动化的，而且在生产管理方面也是科学的。全厂有许多信号灯装置，生产发生了问题，信号灯就马上代替人力来向掌握机器的人报告。工厂的生产量不管是日产量和旬产量，都不用记录人员来记生产数字。当钢坯没有加热之前，必须经过自动磅秤的工序，只要钢坯往上一放，秤表就像打电报似的把产量数字记上了。并且，秤表把每次秤料的数字自动地累计起来。
    无缝钢管厂的自动化生产过程，也给进行操作的工人们带来了无比的幸福，笨重的劳动完全不需要了。在宽大厂房的高空房盖上，有厚厚的轻量玻璃，不管夏天有多么强烈的阳光，也晒不热房盖。安设在厂房里的各个角落的二百多个通风设备，夏天的时候，从送风机送来了可以使人精神愉快的凉风。到了冬天，送风机又送来了适当温度的热风，使人感到温暖。为了防止热风干燥，在热风里面含有轻微的蒸气放散出来，使工人在工作中又温暖又舒服。冬季，厂内温度平均都在摄氏十五度左右。在有瓦斯管道和电气设备的地方，都安设着严密的安全设备，工人在工作中再也不会发生什么危险了。（原载鞍山“工人生活”报）
