    First Automobile Works' Five Major Workshops Exceed Construction Plan
    On October 20th, the five major workshops of the First Automobile Works, which had already commenced construction, exceeded the annual construction plan by 17.67%. This year, these five workshops, along with their associated projects, completed an area of over 186,000 square meters and leveled 270,000 cubic meters of earth. Now, magnificent red buildings stand tall within the vast factory site. The landscape of the construction site is rapidly changing.
    From late August, the First Automobile Works construction site successively launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy, focusing on strengthening planning management. In September, three major workshops reversed the situation of failing to meet targets in July and August, overfulfilled the plan, and secured the start of the forging workshop. Workers in the 103rd construction zone, when building the four-story-high boiler room, implemented parallel segmented assembly line operations and carried out the work plan, completing the eighty-day project sixteen days ahead of schedule. The carpentry workshop implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts in the concrete pouring project, strengthened quality inspection, and increased work efficiency by 1.1 times. All work types exceeded the quota by more than 50%; the quality of the foundations and precast columns met the required standards. Inspired by the victory of the brother construction zones, workers in the non-ferrous metal workshop braved heavy rain and hail, vying to do the most difficult work. The excavation project was completed seven days ahead of schedule, and the foundation project was completed five days ahead of schedule. The ditch digging team of the key workshop—the forging workshop—also completed the twenty-day excavation task four days ahead of schedule.
    Currently, the factory is strengthening planning management and quality responsibility systems while establishing and implementing an economic accounting system. In order to strive for the rapid completion of the factory construction task, preparations for winter construction have been made for prefabricated components needed for next year's project, such as roof panels, ground beams, concrete columns, steel columns, steel frames, and the laying of internal railways. Tens of thousands of workers are greeting winter construction and winter training with the enthusiasm of successfully completing the first year of the project. (Xinhua News Agency)

    第一汽车制造厂五大厂房超额完成建设计划
    十月二十日第一汽车制造厂五个已经开工的大厂房，超额百分之十七点六七完成了全年建设计划。这五个厂房加上附属工程今年已完成面积十八万六千多平方公尺，平土二十七万立方公尺。现在，宽阔的厂址内已矗立着一幢幢红色的壮丽的楼房。工地的面貌正在迅速改变。
    从八月下旬起，第一汽车厂工地相继开展了以加强计划管理为中心的增产节约竞赛。九月份有三个主要厂房扭转了七、八月份完不成任务的局面，超额完成了计划，并争取了锻工场的开工。一零三工区工人们在兴建有四层楼房高的锅炉房时，推行平行分段流水作业，贯彻了作业计划，八十天工程提前十六天完成任务。木工场浇灌混凝土工程贯彻苏联专家建议，加强质量检查，工作效率提高了一点一倍，各工种都超过定额百分之五十以上；基础及预制柱子质量达到标准要求。有色金属工场工人为兄弟工区的胜利所鼓舞，不顾大雨和冰雹，争着干最困难的工作，挖土工程提前七天完成，基础工程提前五天完成。重点厂房——锻工场的沟凸队也提前四天完成了二十天的挖土任务。
    目前，该厂正在加强计划管理和质量责任制的基础上，建立和贯彻经济核算制度。为了争取迅速完成建厂任务，明年工程所需要的预制品如屋面板、地梁、混凝土柱、钢柱钢架以及厂内铁道铺设等已准备冬季施工。数以万计的职工们正以胜利完成第一年工程的热情来迎接冬季施工和冬季训练工作。    （新华社）
