Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 8th: Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission Chairman, General Timayya, replied to Clark on the 7th, stating that there is a "fundamental" difference between the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the U.S. side in their attitudes towards the issue of explanation work.

In his reply to Clark's letter of October 6th, General Timayya pointed out that Clark believes: "The Korean and Chinese prisoners of war made their choice many months ago; as long as there is no force or coercion, the vast majority of prisoners of war will stick to their decisions." Timayya said: "The Commission cannot accept this as an established fact." He said, "This is certainly the opinion of the United Nations Command." He said that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission cannot work based on this assumption.

Timayya said: "So far, about 110 prisoners of war have requested repatriation, which proves that at least some prisoners of war do want to be repatriated. More noteworthy is that not a single prisoner of war dared to publicly request repatriation in their POW camps. They had to do it secretly, or risk being beaten to death or injured by other prisoners of war, or risk being shot dead on the barbed wire by armed guards. The fact that prisoners of war have to express their wishes in such an abnormal way naturally raises suspicions that not all prisoners of war are free."

Timayya said: Explaining to prisoners of war is a "mandatory provision, and according to the terms of reference, the Commission must give the explanation personnel the necessary freedom and facilities. On the one hand, the Commission must protect prisoners of war from all force and threats of force; on the other hand, they also have an obligation to ensure that they carry out the legitimate tasks prescribed by their terms of reference."

He said: The Commission "cannot prove that prisoners of war are not now under the force or threats of force from some other prisoners of war."

Timayya said: The prisoners of war "leaders" (Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee secret agents placed among the prisoners of war) even forbid prisoners of war from expressing their opinions to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. "Obviously, there are two possibilities: one is that these leaders do not trust the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and the other is that they are afraid that once a prisoner of war is left alone in a place, he may change his mind and decide to request repatriation."

General Timayya also cited a letter from Harrison on September 12th to prove that the U.S. side did not truthfully inform the prisoners of war of the "terms of reference." The U.S. side had told the prisoners of war that there were no observers present when the prisoners of war were handed over to the Indian Custodial Force, that they did not have to attend the explanations, and that they would be released immediately after ninety days.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 8th: Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission Chairman, General Timayya, replied to U.S. Brigadier General Hamblen on October 7th, pointing out that some of the empty talk in Hamblen's protest against the "Rules of Procedure for Explanation and Visits" passed by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is unrelated to the specific provisions of the "terms of reference."

Timayya said: "This Commission believes that if your protests and criticisms against the rules of procedure are related to the specific provisions of the 'terms of reference,' then this Commission will be better able to respond."

He continued: "This Commission cannot understand what the correct meaning of your saying that the terms of reference 'use the freedom it is allowed to enjoy as the basis for its decision-making power' is. This Commission does not know of anything that is decided based on anything other than the interpretation of the 'terms of reference'... This Commission first considers the suggestions of both commands, and then makes its own independent decisions in accordance with the responsibilities entrusted to it by the 'terms of reference.' This Commission is determined to fulfill all its responsibilities in accordance with its own interpretation of the 'terms of reference' without fear or favor."

Timayya pointed out in his reply: "This Commission hopes to know which one or several provisions in the rules of procedure violate the 'terms of reference'."

Timayya continued: "It is most surprising that you say that the rules of procedure violate the provisions of Article 3 and Article 8(D) of the 'terms of reference,' because Articles 1 to 6 and Article 16 of the rules of procedure are specifically formulated to implement Article 3, Article 7, and Article 8(D) of the 'terms of reference'."

Everyone knows that Hamblen is in fact demanding a violation of Article 8 of the "terms of reference," which stipulates: "The countries to which the prisoners of war belong have the freedom and convenience... to send representatives to the location where the prisoners of war are held to explain their rights to all prisoners of war affiliated with the country to which they belong and to inform them of any matters related to their return home, especially that they have complete freedom to return home and live a peaceful life." Hamblen is demanding that his secret agents who now control the POW camps be allowed to use force and threats of force to compel prisoners of war to "refuse to accept explanations" in order to prevent the full explanation work stipulated by the "terms of reference" from proceeding.

### 蒂迈雅驳斥克拉克歪曲事实的荒谬言论  并复函斥汉布伦对解释工作细则的无理抗议

    蒂迈雅驳斥克拉克歪曲事实的荒谬言论
    并复函斥汉布伦对解释工作细则的无理抗议
    【新华社开城八日电】中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将在七日答复克拉克说，中立国遣返委员会和美方在对待解释工作问题的态度方面是有“根本”分歧的。
    蒂迈雅将军在答复克拉克十月六日的来信的复信中指出，克拉克认为：“朝中战俘在许多月以前已经进行过选择；只要没有武力和胁迫，绝大多数战俘都将坚持他们的决定”，蒂迈雅说：“委员会不能承认这是确定的事实。”他说，“这当然是联军司令部的意见。”他说，中立国遣返委员会不能根据这种假定进行工作。
    蒂迈雅说：“到目前为止，已有约一百一十名战俘要求遣返，这证明至少有一部分战俘是的确希望遣返的。更加值得注意的是，没有一个战俘敢在他们的战俘营里公开要求遣返。他们在这样做时不得不偷偷地干，或者要冒着被其他战俘打死或打伤的危险，或者要冒着被武装的看守兵用枪打死在铁丝网上的危险。要求遣返的战俘不得不用这种不正常的方式来表达他们的愿望，自然使人怀疑不是所有的战俘都是自由的。”
    蒂迈雅说：对战俘进行解释是“必须履行的条款，根据职权范围，委员会必须给解释人员以必要的自由和便利。一方面，委员会必须保护战俘免于一切武力和武力的威胁；另一方面，他们同样有义务保证他们执行职权范围所规定的合法任务。”
    他说：委员会“不能证明战俘现在不是处于其他一些战俘的武力或武力的威胁之下”。
    蒂迈雅说：战俘“领袖们”（在战俘中间布置的国民党和李承晚特务们）甚至不许战俘对中立国遣返委员会发表意见。“显然这有两种可能，一种可能是这些领袖们不信任中立国遣返委员会，另一种可能是他们害怕一旦让一个战俘独自在一个地方，他也许会改变主意，决定要求遣返。”
    蒂迈雅将军又列举哈利逊在九月十二日给他的一封信，来证明美方没有如实地把“职权范围”告知战俘。美方曾告诉战俘说，在把战俘交给印度看管军的过程中没有观察员在场，在解释时他们不必出席，他们在九十天以后将被立即释放。
   【新华社开城八日电】中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军在十月七日复信给美方汉布伦准将，指出在汉布伦对中立国遣返委员会通过的“解释和访问工作细则”提出的抗议中所说的一些空话，是和“职权范围”的具体规定毫无关系的。
    蒂迈雅说：“本委员会认为，如果你对工作细则所提出的抗议和批评是和‘职权范围’的具体规定有关的，那末，本委员会将会能够更好地作出答复。”
    他继续说：“本委员会不能了解你所说的把职权范围所‘容许它享有的自由作为它作出决定的权力的基础’这句话的正确意义是什么，本委员会不知道有任何事情是根据对‘职权范围’的解释以外的东西作出决定的……本委员会先考虑双方司令部的建议，然后按照‘职权范围’赋与的职责作出自己的独立的决定。本委员会决心要无所惧怕也无所偏袒地按照它自己对‘职权范围’的解释履行自己的一切职责。”
    蒂迈雅在复信中指出：“本委员会希望知道，在工作细则中有哪一条或哪几条规定是违反‘职权范围’的。”
    蒂迈雅继续说：“你说工作细则违反了‘职权范围’第三款和第八款（丁）的规定，这实在是最令人吃惊的事，因为工作细则中的第一款至第六款和第十六款就是专为实施‘职权范围’第三款、第七款和第八款（丁）而订的。”
    大家都知道，汉布伦事实上是要求违反“职权范围”中的第八款，该款规定：“战俘所属国家有自由与便利……派出代表，前往此项战俘被看管的地点，向一切依附于该所属国家的战俘解释他们的权利，并通知他们任何有关他们回返家乡的事项，特别是他们有回家过和平生活的完全自由。”汉布伦要求让他的那些现在控制着战俘营的特务可以用武力和武力的威胁迫使战俘“拒绝接受解释”，以阻止“职权范围”所规定的全部解释工作的进行。
