The Shanxi Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau
Implements Opera Reform Policies with Bias

    Zhao Hongxi, an old artist from the Xinsheng Opera Troupe (county-run) in Changzi County, Changzhi Special District, Shanxi Province, and reader Wang Ganqing, among others, wrote to criticize the Shanxi Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau for only valuing Jin Opera and neglecting the development of other opera genres.

    Zhao Hongxi said in his letter: We perform Shangdang Opera, which is loved by the people of Shangdang. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have elevated the status of artists, allowing us to participate in propaganda and education work. According to Chairman Mao's opera policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," we are also preparing to improve Shangdang Opera. Therefore, the comrades in the troupe enthusiastically wanted to perform in Taiyuan, hoping to hear instructions from the leadership. However, we searched seven times before we found Director He of the Shanxi Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau, but he asked us to find Section Chief Wang of the Literature and Art Section and paid no attention to the problems of the Xinsheng Opera Troupe or Shangdang Opera. When we met Section Chief Wang, he repeatedly declined to discuss our problems, saying he was too busy. We have had enough setbacks.

    He continued: Can this be said to be "Let a hundred flowers bloom"? Chairman Mao's instructions are completely correct, but the cadres of the Shanxi Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau are implementing this instruction with a bureaucratic attitude. They only value Central Shanxi Bangzi Jin Opera, as if other opera genres in Shanxi besides Jin Opera are not worth reforming and developing. We would very much like to know what are the dross and what are the essence in this opera genre that is loved by the people of Shangdang. The Cultural Affairs Bureau can convene a symposium for us, or come and talk with our artists to understand some of the problems of Shangdang Opera. The leading comrades of the Cultural Affairs Bureau only publish articles in the Shanxi Daily, talking emptily about attaching importance to opera heritage and opera artists, but in reality, they are implementing a policy of "letting one flower bloom alone," which is wrong and should be corrected.

### 山西省文化事业管理局  执行戏曲改革政策有偏向

    山西省文化事业管理局
    执行戏曲改革政策有偏向
    山西省长治专区长子县新生剧团（县立）老艺人赵红喜和读者王干青等来信，批评山西省文化事业管理局只重视晋剧，忽视其他剧种的发展。
    赵红喜在信上说：我们演的是上党人民群众喜爱的上党戏。毛主席、共产党提高了艺人的地位，让我们参加了宣传教育工作。根据毛主席指示的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的戏曲方针，我们也准备改进上党戏。因此，剧团内的同志们热情地要到太原演出，希望听取领导方面的指示。但我们找了七次才找见山西省文化事业管理局何局长，但他又要我们找文艺科王科长，对于新生剧团或是上党戏的问题睬也不睬。见到了王科长，他又再三推说没空谈我们的问题。我们算是碰够了钉子。
    他接着说：这能说是“百花齐放”吗？毛主席指示得完全对，但是山西省文化事业管理局干部却用官僚态度执行这一指示。他们只重视中路梆子晋剧，好像晋剧以外的山西其他剧种都不值得改造和发展。我们很想知道在上党人民喜欢的这种剧种中，什么是糟粕，什么是精华。文化事业管理局可以召集我们开个座谈会，或是来和我们艺人谈谈心，了解上党戏的一些问题。文化事业管理局领导同志们只在山西日报上发表文章，空谈重视戏曲遗产、重视戏曲艺人，而实际上却在执行“一花独放”的方针，这是错误的，应该纠正。
