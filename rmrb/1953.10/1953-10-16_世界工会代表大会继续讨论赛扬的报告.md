Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 15th: The Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions continued its discussion of Saillant's report at its meeting on the 13th.

    Delegates warmly welcomed the speech by Nguyen Cong Hoa, head of the delegation of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, at the morning session. He spoke of the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people for national independence against the French colonialists. He said that this struggle had strengthened the unity of the working people in urban and rural areas, and that the trade union played a huge role in promoting the unity of workers and peasants. He made a clear comparison between the improvement of the lives of workers in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the reign of terror in the French-occupied areas of Vietnam. He then said that the Vietnamese working people wholeheartedly support the proposal for united action put forward by the World Federation of Trade Unions and are convinced that the Vietnamese people, supported by all peace-loving mankind, will achieve the freedom and independence of their country.

    Gaston Monmousseau, a veteran leader of the French labor movement, spoke. He paid tribute to the representatives of the Vietnamese working people and emphasized that the French proletariat resolutely condemns the "dirty war" against the Vietnamese people, and that French workers will never cease their struggle against this war.

    Sugiri, the representative of the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions, spoke. He pointed out that there are millions of fully unemployed and semi-unemployed people in Indonesia, one of the reasons for which is the U.S. ban on trade with the People's Republic of China. The alliance of workers and peasants has been strengthened in the struggle. The peasants support the workers' demand for the nationalization of foreign-owned plantations. He suggested that the World Federation of Trade Unions do more work to help workers in colonial and semi-colonial countries and workers in capitalist countries exchange experiences.

    Mansur Bogor, the representative of the Indonesian Trade Union Federation, which has not yet joined the World Federation of Trade Unions, then spoke. He stated that the Indonesian Trade Union Federation wanted to join the World Federation of Trade Unions and pointed out that this would strengthen the struggle of Indonesian workers for rights, for peace and freedom, and against imperialist conspiracies.

    Guruswami, the representative of the All-India Railwaymen's Federation, who was attending the Congress, requested in his speech that the Congress condemn the imperialist policies pursued by Britain, France and other capitalist countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa.

    Elliott, General Secretary of the Australian Seamen's Union, spoke about the struggle of Australian workers to refuse to transport troops and arms to Korea, to strive for trade with the People's Republic of China, and to strive for higher wages. He said: We are working to achieve united action in the factories.

    Vila, the Brazilian representative, conveyed congratulations to the Congress on behalf of the Central Committee of the Latin American Labor Confederation. He pointed out that under the leadership of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Latin American Labor Confederation, the Latin American proletariat has waged a struggle for bread, peace, democracy, trade union freedom and national independence, and has achieved great victories.

    Representatives of the British Guiana workers, the Mongolian People's Republic Trade Union Central Council, the Central Confederation of Labor of Middle Congo, and the representatives of the working people of Yugoslavia also spoke at the morning session.

    The first speaker at the afternoon session was Reza Rusta, General Secretary of the Central United Committee of Iranian Workers and Working People's Trade Unions. He said: The Iranian trade unions fully support the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions. He pointed out that the Iranian working class is leading the national liberation movement, and their collective actions, strikes and demonstrations have enhanced the prestige of workers' organizations in the country. He said that Iran is now under the rule of a regime of terror, and all democratic freedoms are gone. A united front for patriotic struggle is being formed in Iran. The temporary victory of the imperialist lackeys proves that there is no other way to gain freedom and national independence except to launch a struggle by forming a united front led by the working class.

    Renault, representative of the French General Confederation of Labor, pointed out in his speech that the International Social Insurance Conference convened by the World Federation of Trade Unions in March this year has inspired the struggle of workers in capitalist countries and colonial countries to improve social insurance. After listing the struggles being waged by workers in various countries to defend and strive for social insurance, he said that the common struggle to defend, improve and expand social insurance will help strengthen the united action of all working people.

    Rovida, Chairman of the International Metalworkers and Machine Workers Union, cited many examples to show that metallurgical workers and machine manufacturing workers are waging a more resolute struggle to oppose increased exploitation, to strive for better living conditions, and to strive for united action of workers in those industries. He also listed the fact that workers in Norway, Britain, the United States, Australia, Ceylon, Cuba, Venezuela and other countries are demanding that their unions join the International Metalworkers and Machine Workers Union.

    Sios, the representative of the Greek workers, spoke about the plight of the Greek workers and the Greek strike movement. He concluded by saying: No matter what attitude the splitters and traitors to the cause of the workers take, the Greek working class will never leave the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    Brenta Blackman, representing the British Guiana delegation, requested the Congress to call on all trade union organizations in the world to take joint action against the arbitrary rule of the British colonialists in British Guiana and to support the Guianese people in their struggle for peace and freedom.

    Bernini, representative of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, said: Young people fully realize that it is necessary to unite with all working-class organizations, because only with the support of the broad masses of working people can youth protect its rights and improve its status.

    Fernando Santi, Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, pointed out in his speech that the Italian delegation participating in this congress includes people from different political parties and people who do not belong to any political party. He said: They represent not only the five million members of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, but also other trade union organizations.

    Assis, the representative of the Ceylon Workers' Congress, who was attending the Congress, said that the Ceylon Workers' Congress would do its utmost to strengthen the united action and solidarity of workers of all countries, and he put forward some suggestions for improving the work of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the national trade union centers.

    Workers' representatives from Austria, Mexico, Brazil and Sur, the representative of the International Labour Organization, also spoke at the afternoon session.
