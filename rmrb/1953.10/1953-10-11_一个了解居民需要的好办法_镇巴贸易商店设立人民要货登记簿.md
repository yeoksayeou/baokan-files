    A Good Way to Understand Residents' Needs
    ——Zhenba Trading Store Establishes People's Goods Request Register
    Fang Chengjie
    Zhenba County, Shaanxi Province, has many mountains, a small population, and very inconvenient transportation. The state-owned trading store has a very poor understanding of the needs of the county's residents. In the past, in the allocation of materials, there was a lot of blindness, resulting in either commodity backlog or commodity shortages. For example, in the fourth quarter of 1952, more than 300 pieces of New Beauty Vaseline, Green Plum Wine, Double Happiness Green Stripes, fine twill and other colored cloths were transferred from the Nanzheng branch. Because they were not marketable locally, they were backlogged for half a year before being transported back to Nanzheng for sale. However, the local cloth, cotton, bleached cloth, red and white sugar, etc., needed by the people of Zhenba County were out of stock. In particular, the shortage of red and white sugar was even more serious. From October last year to March this year, it was out of stock. The price of sugar rose, causing market chaos and public dissatisfaction.

    In June of this year, all employees of the Zhenba Trading Store studied the advanced experiences of other regions and established a people's goods request register in the retail department. The Zhenba Trading Store has two retail departments, one located in Zhenba County and the other located in Yudu Dam Township Market, more than 100 miles away from the county seat. From June 6th, in these two retail departments, the people's goods request register was hung in the most conspicuous place, divided into eight items: product name, specifications, quantity, request time, registrant's name, occupation, address, and mailing address. The first page reads: Patrons! If there is something you like and need that we don't have here, or if the goods we have are not to your liking, please register them above so that we can improve our supply in a timely manner according to your opinions.

    Since the establishment of the people's goods request register, the salespersons have been publicizing it to the masses anytime and anywhere. Whenever materials that need to be registered are found, they are registered immediately; when people who cannot write request goods, the salesperson will write it for them. From mid-June to July 26, more than 70 varieties were registered. For example, more than 300 pieces of local cloth (local industrial products) produced in Yangxian County were registered, and more than 80,000 kilograms of cotton, Jiqing salt, fruit candy, white sugar, and rock sugar were registered. From these registered materials, the Zhenba Trading Store initially learned the characteristics of the goods requested by residents of all classes: urban residents need mostly industrial products, and they also want good quality, such as Venus fountain pens, Swiss watches, thermos bottles, double-layer washbasins, and Green Treasure soap; while the farmers, who account for the vast majority of the population of Zhenba County, urgently need local cloth, cotton, Jiqing salt, Warrior cigarettes, coarse towels, coarse socks, and lower-quality, cheaper industrial products. These situations have become reliable materials for the Zhenba Trading Store to formulate plans and understand residents' needs.

    The Zhenba Trading Store attaches great importance to the opinions put forward in the people's goods request register. If it can supply the goods, it will quickly organize the source of goods and supply them according to the requirements of the registrant. This not only reversed the phenomenon of commodity shortages, but also increased the variety of goods sold and expanded the sales volume. The variety of commodities in August increased by 70% compared with June and July, the variety of colors increased by more than two-thirds, and the sales volume in early August increased by 203.41% compared with early July, and it has been well received by the masses. For example, Chen Hongxun of the Forestry Station of the county initially thought that it was formalism when he saw the Zhenba Trading Store hanging up the people's goods request register, and it would definitely not work. Registering or not registering would not have much effect. The Type 5 mimeograph he registered on July 10 was purchased for him by the Zhenba Trading Store from Xixiang County at the end of July. When the salesperson of the Zhenba Trading Store notified him by phone that the mimeograph had arrived, Chen Hongxun jumped up with joy. He said: "This method is really good. If we had not established the people's goods request register before, we would have had to go to Nanzheng to purchase it, which would have cost more than 100,000 yuan for a round trip of more than 600 miles." Another example is Yu Shunsheng, a small vendor at No. 30 Democratic Street in the county seat, often sells goods in rural areas. He knows that the cigarettes that farmers like to smoke are the cheap Warrior brand cigarettes. In the past, the Zhenba Trading Store operated Hongjin cigarettes and Zhonghua cigarettes, which were not suitable for sale in rural areas. In mid-June, he registered for Warrior cigarettes in the people's goods request register. On June 29, he bought Warrior cigarettes. He happily said: "If it weren't for this good method, not only would the farmers not be able to buy what they need, but I wouldn't have any business to do."

    一个了解居民需要的好办法
    ——镇巴贸易商店设立人民要货登记簿
    方承杰
    陕西省镇巴县山地多，人口少，交通极不便利，国营贸易商店对该县居民的需要情况了解得很差。以往在物资调拨上，盲目性很大，不是造成商品积压，就是造成商品脱销。如一九五二年第四季度由南郑分公司调进的新美蓝士林、青梅煮酒青、双喜绿条子、细斜等色布三百多匹，因在当地不适销，积压半年后才运回南郑销出；而镇巴县人民需要的土布、棉花、漂白布、红白糖等却脱销，尤其是红白糖脱销现象更加严重，从去年十月至今年三月，一直脱销。糖价上涨，造成市场混乱，群众不满。
    今年六月份，镇巴贸易商店全体职工学习了其他地区的先进经验，在门市部设立了人民要货登记簿。镇巴贸易商店设有两个门市部，一个设在镇巴县城；一个设在离县城一百多里的渔渡坝乡集上。从六月六日起，在这两个门市部就在最惹人注意的地方，挂出了人民要货登记簿，内分品名、规格、数量、要货时间、登记者姓名、职业、住址、通讯地址八项。第一页上写着：顾主们！你们喜爱和需要的东西，我们这里如果没有，或者有的货不如你们的心意，请你们都登记在上面，我们好根据你们的意见，及时改进供应。
    自从人民要货登记簿建立以后，营业员随时随地向群众进行宣传，凡发现有需要登记的材料，当即登记上；不会写字的人要货时，由营业员代写。自六月中旬至七月二十六日止，登记的品种就有七十多种。如洋县出产的土布（地方工业产品），就登记了三百多匹，棉花、吉青盐、水果糖、白糖、冰糖登记了八万多斤。从这些登记的材料中，镇巴贸易商店初步了解到各个阶层居民要货的特点：城市居民需要的大部是工业品，而且在质量上也要好的，如金星水笔、瑞士手表、热水瓶、双料脸盆、绿宝皂等；而占镇巴县人口绝大多数的农民，最迫切需要的是土布、棉花、吉青盐、勇士烟、粗毛巾、粗袜子以及质量较次价钱便宜的工业品。这些情况，成为镇巴贸易商店编制计划与了解居民需要的可靠材料。
    镇巴贸易商店对人民要货登记簿上提出的意见十分重视，能供应的就赶快组织货源，按登记者的要求供应，这样不但扭转了商品脱销现象，而且增加了经营品种，扩大了销货额。八月份商品品种较六、七月份增加百分之七十，花色增加了三分之二以上，八月上旬销货额比七月上旬增加了百分之二百零三点四一，并得到了群众的好评。如该县林业站陈宏勋，起初看到镇巴贸易商店挂出人民要货登记簿时，认为是形式主义，一定办不通，登记不登记作用不大。他七月十日登记的五型油印机，七月底镇巴贸易商店就从西乡县给他买来了。当镇巴贸易商店的营业员用电话通知他油印机已运到时，陈宏勋高兴得跳起来，他说：“这个办法真好，假使以前没有设立人民要货登记簿时，我们要到南郑去购买，来往六百多里路，要多花费十多万元。”又如该县城内民主街三十号小商贩余顺生常在农村贩货，他知道农民喜欢抽的烟是价钱便宜的勇士牌纸烟，过去镇巴贸易商店经营的是红金烟、中华烟，在农村不适销，六月中旬他在人民要货登记簿上登记要勇士烟，六月二十九日就买到了勇士烟，他高兴地说：“要不是这个办法好，不光农民买不到他们需要的东西，就连我也没有生意可做了。”
