It is hoped that the new students of higher education institutions will quickly register and enroll.

　　The seventy thousand new students admitted to higher education institutions this year are about to begin a new life of study. The aspirations of most of the new students in higher education institutions this year are in line with the needs of the country. However, there are still some students whose first choices are concentrated in a small number of schools, departments, and specialties, which is not in line with the principle of the country training talents in various fields in a certain proportion. Therefore, they can only be assigned according to the needs of the country's construction undertakings and their own specific conditions (academic performance, personal expertise, work experience, health conditions, etc.). The vast majority of them consciously and happily obeyed the unified allocation of the country. Some immediately abandoned their personal aspirations that did not meet the needs of the country after receiving the notification and went to the school on the scheduled date to complete the enrollment procedures. Some, after ideological struggle, correctly recognized the relationship between national needs and personal aspirations and also happily accepted the unified allocation of the country. This proves the growth of patriotism among Chinese youth.
    However, there are still a few students who are in a state of fluctuating emotions. They emphasize that "personal interests cannot be changed." Some even made such a "determination": if they are not allowed to transfer departments or schools, they will "stop for a year" and take the exam again next year, without considering the needs of national construction at all. These students' ideas are not beneficial to the country or to individuals. For the country, it will make it impossible to complete the enrollment plan well; for the students themselves, they will lose the opportunity to study. Some students also made such a "determination" last year, which resulted in a year of wasted studies. This is a loss for both the country and the individual, and students should take this as a lesson.
    Students should know that the will of young people should be expressed in fighting tenaciously against all difficulties (including incorrect personal thoughts) for the benefit of the people. If the interests of the people and the country are not put first, and personal opinions are stubbornly insisted upon, then this kind of "insistence" is precisely a damage to the will of young people. All aspects have already told young people a lot about the principle that personal aspirations should be subordinate to national interests. These students also read some articles of this kind and listened to some reports during the application period and before and after the announcement of the list of admitted students. They also went through ideological struggles. Why haven't they unified personal aspirations and national needs yet? This is because some students always feel that obeying the national allocation is like "sacrificing" something. In fact, if personal fantasies that do not meet the needs of the country are "sacrificed" for the benefit of national construction, then this kind of "sacrifice" is precisely a gain, and there is nothing to regret. Because the students have trained the quality of obeying national needs in this process, and this excellent quality is precisely what young people should possess.
    Some new students who were originally working cadres and disabled revolutionary soldiers are also hesitant and requesting adjustments to regions or schools because of some personal difficulties that can be overcome. These difficulties exist; however, we are entering higher education institutions to study in response to the call of the Party, to master scientific knowledge, and to train ourselves to become new types of experts. In this struggle to take down the scientific fortress, we will encounter more and greater difficulties. If we cannot overcome even these difficulties, how will we overcome the difficulties in learning? We believe that revolutionary cadres will never be defeated by these difficulties!
    Now, all higher education institutions across the country are warmly welcoming new students to enroll. Within a few days, all new students in higher education institutions will complete registration and formally start classes. Time is so tight, we hope that the few students who are still hesitating will overcome their unrealistic personal ideas for the sake of the country's construction and immediately report to the school and devote themselves to a new life of study.
    Among this year's new students, there are indeed some people who have been inappropriately assigned. For example, some students suffering from flat feet, color blindness, arthritis, high blood pressure, and other diseases were assigned to the Geological College; a disabled revolutionary soldier who could not raise his hands was assigned to the Normal College; a drafting technician who had worked in architectural drawing for five years applied to the Department of Civil Engineering and Architecture of a higher education institution because he hoped to further his studies, but he was assigned to the Medical College; and a medical worker in the army with six years of fighting history was assigned to the Department of History. This is obviously caused by negligence in the unified allocation work. The National Higher Education Enrollment Committee should promptly adjust these inappropriate allocations with a high degree of responsibility so as not to delay these students' studies.

### 希望高等学校新生迅速报到入学

    希望高等学校新生迅速报到入学
    今年高等学校录取的七万名新生，就要开始新的学习生活了。今年高等学校新生的志愿，大多数都符合国家的需要。但是，也还有一部分同学填报的第一志愿，集中于少数学校、少数科系和专业，不适合于国家按一定比例培养各方面建设人材的原则，因而，只能根据国家建设事业的需要和他们本人的具体条件（学业成绩、个人特长、工作经历、健康情况等），予以分配。他们中间的绝大多数都自觉地、愉快地服从了国家的统一分配，有的在接到通知单以后，立即放弃了不合国家需要的个人志愿，在预定日期，到校办理了入学手续；有的经过思想斗争，正确地认识了国家需要和个人志愿的关系，也愉快地接受了国家的统一分配。这证明了我国青年中爱国主义思想的增长。
    但是，目前仍有少数同学还处在动荡不定的情绪中。他们强调“个人兴趣不能移”。有的甚至下了这样的“决心”：如果不让转系转校，就“停它一年”，明年再考，根本不考虑国家建设的需要。这些同学的想法，对于国家，对于个人，都是没有什么好处的。对于国家来说，将使招生计划不能很好地完成；对于同学自己来说，将会失去学习的机会。去年也有些同学下过这样的“决心”，结果使自己的学业荒废了一年，这对国家对个人都是损失，同学们应当引为教训。
    同学们应该知道，青年人的意志应该表现在为了人民的利益，顽强地同一切困难（包括个人的不正确思想在内）作斗争。如果不把人民和国家的利益放在第一位，固执地坚持个人意见，那末，这种“坚持”，恰恰对青年们的意志是一种损害。关于个人志愿应当服从国家利益的道理，各方面已经向青年们讲得很多了。这些同学，在报考期间，在发榜前后，也读了一些这类文章，听了一些报告，他们也经过了思想斗争，为什么还没有把个人志愿和国家需要统一起来呢？这是因为，有的同学总觉得服从国家分配，就好像“牺牲”了什么似的。其实，如果为了国家建设的利益，“牺牲”了不合国家需要的个人幻想，那末，这种“牺牲”倒正是一种收获，一点没有什么可惜。因为同学们在这中间锻炼了服从国家需要的品质，而这种优良的品质正是青年们所应当具备的。
    有一些原先是在职干部、革命残废军人的新生，因为个人的一些可以克服的困难，也在犹豫，要求调整地区或学校。这些困难是存在的；但是，我们进入高等学校学习，是为了响应党的号召，掌握科学知识，把自己锻炼成为新型的专家。在拿下科学堡垒的这场斗争中，将会遇到更多更大的困难的。假如我们连这点困难也不能克服，将怎样克服学习当中的困难呢？我们相信革命的干部决不会被这些困难所难倒！
    现在全国各高等学校都在热烈地欢迎新生入学。几天之内，所有高等学校的新生都将注册完毕，正式上课。时间是这样紧迫，我们希望少数还在犹豫的同学，为了祖国的建设事业，克服个人不切实际的想法，立即到校报到，投入新的学习生活。
    在今年的新生当中，也确实有一些人是分配得不适当的。例如，有一些患有平足、色盲、关节炎、高血压等疾病的同学，被分配在地质学院；有个革命残废军人，双手不能举起，被分配到了师范学院；有一个做了五年建筑绘图工作的绘图技术员，因为希望深造而报考高等学校土木建筑系，可是他却被分配到了医学院；而一个有六年斗争历史的部队医务工作者，却被分配到历史系。这显然是由于统一分配工作上的疏忽所造成的。对于这些分配不当的现象，全国高等学校招生委员会应当以高度负责的精神，迅速予以调整，免得延误了这些同学的学习。
