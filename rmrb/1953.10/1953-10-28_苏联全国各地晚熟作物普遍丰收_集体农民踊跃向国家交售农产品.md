(Xinhua News Agency, October 27th) Soviet agricultural laborers are working intensely in the autumn fields. Good news of bumper harvests and enthusiastic sales of agricultural products to the state by collective farmers are constantly pouring in from all over.

According to TASS: The harvesting of late-maturing grains, potatoes, sugar beets, and forage grasses is nearing completion throughout the Soviet Union. The harvesting of late-maturing crops such as cotton, vegetables, corn, and fruits is proceeding intensely. As of October 15th, collective farms and state farms across the country had harvested 850,000 hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu) more potatoes than in the same period last year. The sugar beet digging in the central provinces of the Russian Federation concluded on the 20th. The Ukrainian Republic has harvested more than three-quarters of its sugar beets; the western provinces of the republic are averaging 230 to 240 centners (1 centner equals 200 jin) of sugar beets per hectare, with many collective farms harvesting 400 to 500 centners per hectare. By mid-October, the country had delivered more than 3 million tons (1 ton equals 2,000 jin) more sugar beets to sugar factories than in the same period last year. Regarding cotton harvesting, by mid-October, collective farms in the Azerbaijan Republic had harvested 50% more cotton than in the same period last year; collective farms have already sold three-quarters of the cotton stipulated by the annual plan to the state. Collective farms in the Uzbek Republic, the main cotton-producing area of the Soviet Union, harvested nearly 200,000 tons more cotton this year than last year. In the Tajik Republic, the unit yield of cotton per hectare of land in collective farms is as high as 50 centners. Many collective farms and state farms have overfulfilled their tasks of selling cotton to the state.

In the southern regions of the Soviet Union, the harvesting of fruits and grapes is currently underway, while many other regions are harvesting cabbage and other late-maturing vegetables. This year, the total amount of vegetables purchased and stored by the Soviet Union to ensure an adequate supply for cities and industrial centers is hundreds of thousands of tons more than last year.

At the same time, agricultural laborers across the Soviet Union are vigorously plowing autumn fields. As of October 10th, over 14.42 million hectares more autumn fields had been plowed than in the same period last year. The winter sowing work of collective farms and state farms in various regions has also commenced. By mid-October, approximately 500,000 hectares more wheat fields had been sown than last year. In this year's winter sowing work, collective farms are widely applying advanced farming methods. Nearly 8 million hectares of land have been sown with winter crops using cross-sowing and narrow-row planting methods. Various regions are also using mineral fertilizers and local fertilizers to fertilize winter crops.

    苏联全国各地晚熟作物普遍丰收
    集体农民踊跃向国家交售农产品
    【新华社二十七日讯】苏联农业劳动者正在紧张地进行秋季田间工作。各地不断传来丰收喜讯和集体农民踊跃向国家交售农产品的消息。
    据塔斯社消息：苏联全国各地的晚熟谷物、马铃薯、甜菜和牧草的收获工作，即将结束。棉花、蔬菜、玉蜀黍、水果等晚熟作物的收获工作正在紧张地进行着。到十月十五日为止，全国各地的集体农庄和国营农场比去年同期多收了八十五万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）马铃薯。俄罗斯联邦中部各州的甜菜挖掘工作到二十日就告结束。乌克兰共和国已收了四分之三以上的甜菜；共和国西部各州平均每公顷收二百三十到二百四十公担（每公担合二百市斤）的甜菜，有许多集体农庄每公顷收四百到五百公担。到十月中旬，全国各地交给制糖工厂的甜菜，比去年同期多三百多万吨（每吨合两千市斤）。在棉花的收获工作方面，阿塞拜疆共和国各集体农庄到十月中旬收获的棉花，比去年同期多百分之五十；集体农庄已向国家交售了全年计划所规定的四分之三的棉花。苏联主要棉花产地乌兹别克共和国各集体农庄今年收获的棉花，比去年增加了近二十万吨。在塔吉克共和国，集体农庄每公顷土地的棉花单位面积产量高达五十公担。许多集体农庄和国营农场已超额完成了向国家交售棉花的任务。
    苏联南部地区目前正在收摘水果和葡萄，其他许多地区正在收割甘蓝和其他晚熟蔬菜。今年，苏联为保证充分供应城市和工业中心的需要而采购和储藏的蔬菜总量，比去年多几十万吨。
    和这同时，苏联各地的农业劳动者正在大力翻耕秋田。到十月十日为止，已翻耕完毕的秋田比去年同期多一千四百二十多万公顷。各地的集体农庄和国营农场冬季播种的工作也展开了。到十月中旬已经播种的小麦田比去年多五十万公顷左右。在今年的冬播工作中，各集体农庄正在广泛地应用先进的耕作方法。有将近八百万公顷的田地用交叉播种法和窄行种植法播种了冬季作物。各地还在使用矿质肥料和地方肥料来进行冬季作物的施肥工作。
