Zhang Zhiquan Agricultural Production Cooperative
Careful Calculation to Strive to Complete the Production Increase Plan

Dearest Chairman Mao:

Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, our cooperative has corrected the deviations of impetuous advancement, summarized the experience since the establishment of the cooperative, and all members have recognized the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives and established the concept of "everyone running the cooperative well," making the cooperative more consolidated and improved, and steadily advancing.

In terms of production, although our village has suffered three disasters in the past eight months (spring frost, summer flood, and autumn drought), we have still achieved an increase in grain production. In the spring, after 25 mu of wheat on the ridge suffered from frost, Zhang Zhiquan (agricultural labor model) immediately organized the members to cultivate and hoe the wheat fields and apply topdressing fertilizer, ensuring a good wheat harvest; the yield was 173.3 jin per mu, an increase of 64.9 jin per mu compared to last year. In the summer, after 45 mu of soybean land in the river滩 was flooded, Zhang Zhiquan immediately organized the members to find ways to make up for the loss, cultivating the cooperative's 261.6 mu of rice fields one more time and increasing the amount of topdressing fertilizer; the other 261 mu of miscellaneous fields were also cultivated one more time; and 15 mu of radish and turnip were planted on the edges of the fields, field heads, and embankments of water-soaked areas. It now appears that although it has not rained for forty days since the Beginning of Autumn, the yield of millet can still be increased by 20 jin per mu, the yield of miscellaneous grains can be increased by more than 10 jin per mu, and the yield of radish and turnip can be 300 jin per mu. In addition, because we focused on contracting this year, which promoted the enthusiasm of the members, in addition to improving technology on the land, we were also able to extract fifteen mud and wood craftsmen for handicraft and sideline production, earning a total of 14 million yuan when the accounts were settled on September 1st, exceeding the original plan by 40% before the end of autumn.

Although the agricultural income of our cooperative has increased by an average of 15 jin per mu compared to last year, it is still 35 jin short of the original production increase plan. We are determined to continue our efforts to strive to complete the original production increase plan.

First, we must overcome the drought and do a good job in autumn production. The 135 mu of regular wheat began to be sown two days before the White Dew, and all have now been sown. In addition to the original three harrows and five rakes for the wheat fields and the general repair of the embankments, we also harrowed and raked once each during and three days after sowing. All seeds have undergone germination tests and hot water soaking, and the sowing depth is half an inch deeper than in the past, and close planting is achieved. Now all the wheat seedlings have emerged from the soil, with no gaps. We have also expanded the area of catch-crop wheat land. After organizing male and female members to harvest 45 mu of early-maturing crops in three days, we also plowed, harrowed, carried manure, and repaired the wheat fields while harvesting, and have now prepared 40 mu of catch-crop wheat land and the required fertilizer; we have also decided to carry water to sow five mu of land that is too dry. In terms of autumn field harvesting, we will ensure that we harvest one piece as soon as it ripens, and thresh it immediately, to avoid crop losses. Because of the drought, half of the seeds of four mu of densely planted high-yield millet are still green, and Zhang Zhiquan has led forty members to carry 1,300 loads of water to irrigate it. Fifteen mu of radishes and turnips have also been irrigated with water once.

Second, we must do a good job in sideline production. In addition to the labor force required for agricultural production, we have also extracted sixteen mud and wood craftsmen to repair and build houses in the city for one and a half months, which is estimated to increase income by 6 million yuan. We must raise the existing 120 sheep well, prepare sheep grass and repair sheep pens in the autumn. In addition, we sold the cooperative's fifteen fat pigs for 5 million yuan, and then took out 600,000 yuan to buy back twenty piglets for household sideline production.

Finally, all of our members must prevent extravagance and waste, reduce unnecessary expenses, and ensure that the increased income is invested in reproduction.

    张志全农业生产合作社
    精打细算争取完成增产计划亲爱的毛主席：
    俺社在党和人民政府的领导下，纠正了急躁冒进的偏向，总结了组社以来的经验，全体社员认识了农业生产合作社的优越性，树立了“大家办好社”的观念，使合作社更加巩固提高，稳步前进。
    在生产方面，俺村虽然八个多月来受了三次灾（春季冻灾，夏季水灾，秋季旱灾），但仍然做到了增产粮食。在春季有二十五亩岭地麦受冻灾后，张志全（农业劳动模范）马上组织社员对麦田加工普锄、上追肥，保证了小麦丰收；每亩产一百七十三斤三两，比去年每亩增产六十四斤九两。在夏季河滩四十五亩黄豆地受水灾后，张志全马上组织社员找补产办法，把全社二百六十一亩六分谷田多锄一次，增加了上追肥的数目；其他各种杂田二百六十一亩也多锄了一次；又在地边、地头与水浸地边堰上种萝葡、菜根十五亩。现在看来，虽然立秋以来四十天未下雨，但谷子每亩还可以增产二十斤，杂粮每亩可以增产十斤以上，萝葡、菜头每亩可以产三百斤。此外，由于今年抓住了包工，促进了社员积极性，除了在土地上加工改进技术外，还能抽出十五个泥木匠进行手工业、副业生产，在九月一日结账，共赚了一千四百万元，未到秋季结束，已超过原计划百分之四十。
    我社农业收入虽然比去年平均每亩增产十五斤，但比起原增产计划还不足三十五斤。我们决心继续努力争取完成原增产计划。
    首先，我们要战胜天旱，做好秋季生产。一百三十五亩正茬麦在白露前两天开始下种，现已全部种完。麦田除原已耕三耙五、边堰普修，在下种时和下种后三天又各耙耢一次。种籽都经过发芽试验和温汤浸种，下种比过去深半寸，并做到密植。现在麦苗全部出土，不缺一株。我们还扩大了赶茬麦地。经组织男女社员在三天内收割了四十五亩早熟作物，并且做到一面收割、一面耕耙担粪修麦地，现在已经准备好四十亩赶茬麦地和所需的肥料；其中有五亩地太干，我们也决定要担水赶种。秋田收割方面保证黄一块，割一块，打一块，避免庄稼损失。有四亩密植丰产谷因为天旱，有一半籽还发青绿，张志全已带着四十个社员担水一千三百担灌溉。十五亩萝卜和菜头也全部担水灌溉一次。
    其次，要搞好副业生产。除了农业生产所需要的劳动力外，我们又抽出了十六个泥木匠进城修盖房屋一个半月，估计可以增加收入六百万元。要养好现有的一百二十只羊，在秋季准备好羊草和修好羊圈。此外，我们还把现在全社十五口肥猪卖了五百万元，又拿出六十万元买回二十口小猪，进行家庭副业生产。
    最后，我们全体社员还要防止铺张浪费，减少不必要的开支，保证把增产收入投入再生产。
