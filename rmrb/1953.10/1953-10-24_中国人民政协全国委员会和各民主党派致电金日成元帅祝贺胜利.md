Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and various democratic parties sent a telegram to Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, to congratulate the Chinese and Korean people's armies on the third anniversary of their joint resistance against American aggression. The telegram reads as follows:

To Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army:

    On the occasion of the third anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers going abroad to join the Korean People's Army in resisting American aggression, we, on behalf of the Chinese people, extend our highest respect to you and all the heroic Korean People's Army and the Korean people.

    For the past three years, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have fought side by side in this just war of resistance against aggression, defeating the frantic aggression of American imperialism and forcing it to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement with us. This great victory not only defended the security of China and Korea but also greatly inspired the confidence and courage of peace-loving people around the world in striving for lasting peace and opposing wars of aggression.

    American warmongers and the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique are continuing to conspire to forcibly detain prisoners of war, obstructing and sabotaging the political conference. Our task is not yet fully completed. The entire Chinese people are determined to continue to deepen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, support the Korean People's Army and the Korean people, and strive for the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the rapid convocation of a political conference, the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and the restoration of peaceful economic construction in Korea!

    Long live the heroic Korean People's Army and the Korean people!

    Long live the solid fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!

    The National Committee of the Chinese People'
