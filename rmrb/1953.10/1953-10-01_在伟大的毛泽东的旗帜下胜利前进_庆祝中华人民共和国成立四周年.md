    Advance Victoriously Under the Great Banner of Mao Zedong
    ——Celebrating the Fourth Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China
    Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Ma Xulun
    Today, the people of the whole country celebrate the fourth anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China with incomparable excitement. Although our new country has only been established for four years, its brilliant achievements in all aspects have brought our great motherland into a new historical period, and on the basis of successfully completing economic recovery, the first five-year national construction plan has begun. The victory of the sacred War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea has established immortal feats in the history of human peace. The glorious achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fighting side by side have not only defended the security of our motherland and assisted the heroic Korean people, thereby guaranteeing our country's economic recovery and construction, but also severely cracked down on the aggressors and inspired hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement eloquently proves that the era in which imperialism could occupy a country by setting up a few cannons on an eastern coast has been declared over forever, and the power of the people can completely defeat any heinous imperialist aggression. As Comrade Malenkov recently pointed out, the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is the most important milestone in the struggle of all peace forces against aggression and international adventurism. It vividly proves that as long as all peace-loving forces can persevere unremittingly, sharp international issues can be resolved as they should be.
    Undoubtedly, the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement has helped ease international tensions to a certain extent, but we must still be seriously vigilant against the fact that the aggressive forces are still struggling to the utmost, still carrying out various conspiracies to undermine the armistice, and attempting to continue creating tensions in the Asian and Pacific regions. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles openly concluded the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with Syngman Rhee on August 8. The United States also coerced the Seventh United Nations General Assembly into passing the "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" which directly violates Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement. At the Eighth United Nations General Assembly, Dulles's speech on the issue of Korean unification completely adopted Syngman Rhee's position, unreasonably demanding that North Korea submit to Syngman Rhee, who violates national interests, and expanding Syngman Rhee's power to the entire Korea. The U.S. Navy continues to occupy our territory of Taiwan. The United States continues to implement an illegal "embargo" against our country. The United States is stubbornly obstructing our country from restoring its legitimate rights in the United Nations and international affairs. Therefore, our current primary task is to stand together with the peace-loving people of the world, headed by the Soviet Union, and continue to fight resolutely for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; taking the Korean armistice as a starting point, we must strive for a further easing of the international situation. It is especially important that the people of our country should fully support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, continue to deeply develop the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and make any warmongers' conspiracies unable to succeed.
    The Korean armistice clearly reflects the contrast between the strengths of the two major camps in the world: our peaceful and democratic camp is completely united and its strength is growing; conversely, the imperialist aggressive camp is increasingly disintegrating and facing numerous difficulties. It is very obvious that the great friendship between the peace-loving People's Republic of China and the peace-loving Soviet Union has become the indestructible Great Wall of Peace admired by the world!
    The great Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, concluded on February 14, 1950, is constantly developing and consolidating. The Soviet government faithfully and unreservedly fulfills its obligations as an ally, providing our country with comprehensive, long-term, and selfless assistance. Recently, the Soviet government agreed to provide systematic economic and technical assistance in the construction and reconstruction of 141 large-scale enterprises, and to help our country train technical personnel and continue to send experts to work in our country. This will undoubtedly play an extremely significant role in our country's realization of industrialization, gradual transition to socialism, and strengthening of the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    The profound friendship between our country and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which is as close as lips and teeth, has become even more developed and unbreakable due to the joint combat of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army and the mutual support of the two peoples over the past three years. In our country's cause of opposing aggression, defending peace, and carrying out domestic construction, we have also continuously received sincere support from other fraternal people's democratic countries. Our country's friendly relations with various people's democratic countries are developing day by day through economic cooperation and cultural exchanges.
    The aggressors are attempting to isolate us, but in fact it is they themselves who are isolated. The international situation is completely in our favor. Our friends are all over the world. Especially with a great friend like the Soviet Union, using its rich experience in socialist construction over the past 30 years to assist and guide us, all the conditions we have when starting national planned construction are much better than when the Soviet Union began construction. We, the Chinese people, must work even harder, and under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, actively participate in national construction and strengthen the country's economic and defense capabilities.
    According to Chairman Mao's instructions, the basic task of our first five-year construction plan is: first, to concentrate major forces on developing heavy industry and establishing the foundation for national industrialization and defense modernization; correspondingly, to cultivate construction talents, develop transportation, light industry, agriculture, and expand commerce; to promote the cooperativization of agriculture and handicrafts step by step and to transform private industry and commerce, and to correctly utilize the roles of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. All of these are to ensure that the proportion of socialist elements in the national economy steadily increases, and to ensure that the material and cultural lives of the people are gradually improved on the basis of developing production.
    This year is the first year of our first five-year construction plan. The basic situation of our financial and economic work is good. In the first half of the year, the production of industry and transportation generally exceeded the plan. Private industry and commerce have also greatly increased, surpassing the level of the same period last year and the year before. In agriculture, in addition to some natural disasters in some areas, most areas are still good. In education, the number of primary school students nationwide is now more than double the highest year during the Kuomintang rule (1946), the number of middle school students has increased by more than one and a half times, and the number of college students has increased to more than 220,000. At present, the responsibility of the people of our country in national construction is to greatly increase production, expand income, practice strict economy, tighten expenditures, tap potential, overcome difficulties, grasp the key, and advance steadily in every position, striving to complete and overfulfill the national plan for this year. The broad masses of cultural, educational, and government workers must earnestly study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, sincerely study the advanced experience of Soviet economic and cultural construction, continue to carry out ideological transformation in conjunction with their work, improve teaching quality, and effectively improve their work. We must not only oppose blind adventurism, but also prevent the conservative tendency of being afraid of difficulties and being satisfied with the status quo. Industrialists and businessmen should recognize their role in the current national construction, obey the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, give play to the enthusiasm for production, resolutely oppose the "five evils" and other illegal profit-seeking behaviors, and ensure the completion of the national tax revenue plan.
    In order to further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, and give full play to the enthusiasm of the people as masters of the country in actively participating in national construction and defending the cause of peace, we have implemented the system of people's congresses elected by universal suffrage since this year. At present, the pilot work of universal suffrage in various parts of the country has been completed successively, and the universal suffrage of basic-level people's congresses is being gradually carried out comprehensively. This is a major development in the construction of our country's people's democratic regime. People from all walks of life across the country are participating in this movement with unparalleled enthusiasm. It is wrong for some cultural, educational, and government workers to show a passive, indifferent, and uncaring attitude. We must correct our understanding and resolutely overcome it. We must not only seriously and earnestly exercise our right to vote, but also closely integrate the election work with production and construction, and play an active role in the great election movement.
    Our China Association for Promoting Democracy is a new democratic political party of the united front nature that unites, educates, and transforms petty-bourgeois intellectuals. The vast majority of our members are cultural and educational workers, especially primary and secondary school teachers. At present, our central task is to urge organizations at all levels to strengthen political and ideological education, help everyone improve their political awareness, eliminate ideological obstacles, closely connect with the masses under the leadership of the Party and administrative leaders in each unit, combine with the work of the unit, intensify study and transformation, do a good job, actively take the lead in every specific task, implement national policies and complete national plans, so that our members and the masses they are connected with can make beneficial contributions to the country and the people.
    We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, with the comprehensive, long-term, and selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, and with the support of the people of various people's democratic countries and the just people of the world, as long as we firmly strive to overcome difficulties, our cause is invincible, we will definitely be able to steadily realize national industrialization, gradually complete socialist transformation, and make our motherland gradually transition to socialism. Let us advance victoriously under the great banner of Mao Zedong! Long live the great People's Republic of China! Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!

    在伟大的毛泽东的旗帜下胜利前进
    ——庆祝中华人民共和国成立四周年
    中国民主促进会主席   马叙伦
    今天，全国人民以无比兴奋的心情，庆祝伟大的中华人民共和国成立四周年。我们的新国家虽仅成立四年，但是在各方面的辉煌成就，已使我们伟大祖国进入了新的历史时期，在胜利完成经济恢复的基础上，开始了第一个五年国家建设计划。神圣的抗美援朝斗争的胜利，在人类和平的历史上建下了不朽的功勋。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战的光荣业绩，不但捍卫了我们祖国的安全，援助了英雄的朝鲜人民，从而使我国经济恢复和建设得到保障，而且严重地打击了侵略者，鼓舞着全世界亿万爱好和平的人民，朝鲜停战协定的签订雄辩地证明着：帝国主义在东方一个海岸上架起几尊大炮就可以占领一个国家的时代已经宣告永远结束，人民的力量完全可以击败任何穷凶极恶的帝国主义侵略行动。正如马林科夫同志最近所指出的，朝鲜停战协定的签订是一切和平力量反对侵略势力和国际冒险势力的斗争中最重要的里程碑。它生动地证明了，只要一切爱好和平的力量能坚忍不拔，尖锐的国际问题是可以获得应有的解决的。
    无疑的，朝鲜停战协定的签订在一定程度上有助于国际紧张局势的缓和，但我们仍不能不严重警惕侵略势力还在尽力挣扎，还在进行种种破坏停战的阴谋，企图在亚洲和太平洋区域继续造成紧张局势。美国国务卿杜勒斯公然在八月八日与李承晚缔结了所谓“共同防御条约”。美国又在第七届联合国大会中挟持通过了直接违背停战协定第六十款的“十五国提案”。在第八届联合国大会中，杜勒斯对于朝鲜统一问题的发言完全采取了李承晚的立场，毫无道理地要北朝鲜向违反民族利益的李承晚屈服，把李承晚的权力扩大到整个朝鲜。美国海军继续侵占着我国领土台湾。美国继续对我国实施非法的“禁运”。美国蛮横地阻挠我国恢复在联合国及国际事务中应享的合法权利。因此我们目前的首要任务，就是要和以苏联为首的世界爱好和平的人民在一起，继续为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决而坚决斗争；以朝鲜停战为出发点，努力争取国际形势进一步的缓和。尤其重要的，我们全国人民还应全力支持中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，继续深入开展抗美援朝运动，使任何好战分子的阴谋无法得逞。
    朝鲜停战显明地反映了世界两大阵营力量的对比：我们和平民主阵营完全团结一致，力量日益壮大；相反地，帝国主义侵略阵营日益分崩离析，困难重重。非常明显，爱好和平的中华人民共和国与爱好和平的苏联的伟大友谊，已成了举世所仰望的不可摧毁的保卫和平的长城！
    一九五○年二月十四日缔结的伟大的中苏友好互助同盟，不断地发展和巩固着。苏联政府忠诚不贰地履行同盟者的义务，给予我国全面的、长期的、无私的援助。最近苏联政府又同意在建设和改建的一百四十一项规模巨大的企业中给以系统的经济的和技术的援助，并帮助我国培养技术人员，继续派遣专家来我国工作。这对于我国实现工业化，逐步过渡到社会主义和壮大以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，毫无疑问将发挥极其重大的作用。
    我国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国之间唇齿相依的深厚友谊，由于三年来中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的并肩作战及两国人民的相互支持，更加发展和牢不可破了。在我国反对侵略保卫和平和进行国内建设事业中，也不断得到其他各人民民主兄弟国家真诚的支持，我国与各人民民主国家的友好关系，正通过经济合作和文化交流而日益开展。
    侵略者妄图孤立我们，而事实上孤立的正是他们自己。国际形势完全于我们有利。我们的朋友遍天下。特别是像苏联这样伟大的朋友，以其三十多年来社会主义建设的丰富经验来援助和指导我们，我们在开始国家有计划建设时的所有条件，要比当年苏联开始建设时优越得多。我们中国人民一定要更加淬砺奋发，在伟大的毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，积极参加国家建设，加强国家经济力量和国防力量。
    依照毛主席的指示，我们第一个五年建设计划的基本任务是：首先集中主要力量发展重工业，建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础；相应地培养建设人才，发展交通运输业、轻工业、农业和扩大商业；有步骤地促进农业、手工业的合作化和进行对私营工商业的改造，并正确地发挥个体农业、手工业和私营工商业的作用。所有这些，都是为了保证国民经济中社会主义成分的比重稳步增长，为了保证在发展生产的基础上逐步提高人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平。
    今年是我们第一个五年建设计划开始的第一年。我们财经工作的基本情况是良好的，上半年工业和交通运输业的生产一般都超额完成，私营工商业亦大大上升，超过去年和前年同期的水平，农业方面除了部分地区有些天然灾害，大部分地区仍是好的。教育方面，目前全国小学生比国民党统治时期的最高年度（一九四六年）增加一倍多，中学生增加一倍半以上，高等学校学生增至二十二万余人。目前我们全国人民在国家建设中的责任，就是要大力增加生产，扩大收入，厉行节约，紧缩开支，在各个岗位上，发掘潜力，克服困难，抓住关键，稳步前进，争取完成和超额完成今年国家计划。广大的文教工作者和机关工作者，必须认真学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，诚心诚意地学习苏联经济建设和文化建设的先进经验，结合业务继续进行思想改造，提高教学质量，切实改进工作。我们既要反对盲目冒进，也要防止害怕困难，满足于现状的保守主义倾向。工商业者应当认识自己在当前国家建设中的作用，服从工人阶级和国营经济的领导，发挥生产的积极性，坚决反对“五毒”及其他非法牟利行为，保证完成国家税收计划。
    为了进一步巩固人民民主专政，巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，充分发挥人民群众国家主人翁的积极性，积极参加国家建设和保卫和平的事业，我们从今年起实行普选的人民代表大会制度，目前全国各地普选的试办工作已先后完成，正逐步开展全面的基层人民代表大会的普选工作。这是我国人民民主政权建设的重大发展，全国各阶层人民正以无比的热情参加这一运动，我们文教工作者和机关工作者中还有人表现消极冷淡和不暇过问的态度是不对的，必须端正认识，坚决予以克服，我们不但要严肃认真地执行自己的选举权利，而且要使选举工作密切结合生产建设，在伟大的普选运动中发挥积极作用。
    我们中国民主促进会是团结、教育、改造小资产阶级知识分子为主的统一战线性质的新民主主义政治党派，我们绝大部分会员是文教工作者，而其中尤以中小学教师为主。目前我们的中心任务就是督促各级组织，加强政治思想教育，帮助大家提高政治觉悟，扫除思想障碍，在各单位的党和行政领导下，密切联系群众，结合本单位业务，加紧学习改造，做好工作，在每一具体任务上积极带头，贯彻国家政策和完成国家计划，使我们会员及所联系的群众对国家人民作出有益的贡献。
    我们完全相信：在伟大的毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导之下，在伟大的苏联全面的、长期的、无私的援助之下，在各人民民主国家和全世界正义人民的支持之下，只要我们坚定努力，克服困难，我们的事业是不可战胜的，我们一定能够稳步地实现国家工业化，逐步完成社会主义改造，使我们祖国逐步过渡到社会主义。让我们在伟大的毛泽东的旗帜下胜利前进！伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！中国共产党万岁！中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
