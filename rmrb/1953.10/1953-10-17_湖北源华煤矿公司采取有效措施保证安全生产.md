Hubei Yuanhua Coal Mine Company letter: The criticism made by reader Du Jin in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on September 2 regarding our mine's neglect of safe production is correct (but the number of workers who died due to accidents from January to May this year, excluding the fire accident on May 29, should be one).

Our company's leadership does indeed have serious bureaucratic tendencies. Our daily safety education work for the workers is very poor. In terms of management, we lack a systematic and scientific system, and our work often falls into a state of chaos. Many tasks are assigned but not checked, and the leadership knows very little about the situation below. Usually, there is not enough praise and criticism, rewards and punishments are unclear, resulting in a long-term lack of responsibility and lax discipline. The above are the basic reasons for the repeated accidents in our mine.

After the painful lesson of this fire accident, we are taking the following measures to improve our work: First, to educate employees to strengthen labor discipline; Second, to carry out the study of safety regulations, and put forward different requirements for different positions and types of work; Third, to establish and improve various systems such as the wellhead inspection system, shift handover system, blaster system, safety responsibility system, and safety reward and punishment system; Fourth, the higher authorities have allocated 1 billion yuan specifically for security equipment, and are now proceeding according to plan. Through the above series of work, our mine has achieved preliminary results in safe production in July and August.

    湖北源华煤矿公司采取有效措施保证安全生产
    湖北源华煤矿公司来信：九月二日“读者来信摘要”栏所刊读者杜劲对我矿忽视安全生产的批评是正确的（但今年一月到五月因事故而死亡的工人人数，如不把五月二十九日火灾事故计算在内，应为一人）。
    我们公司领导方面的确存在严重的官僚主义，平日对工人群众的安全教育工作做得很差；在管理方面缺乏系统的、科学的制度，工作常常陷于忙乱状态；不少工作有布置无检查，领导方面对下情知道得很少；平时表扬和批评也很不够，赏罚不明，以致无人负责和纪律松弛现象长期存在。以上就是我矿屡次发生事故的基本原因。
    经过这次火灾事故的惨痛教训，我们正采取以下措施来改进工作：一、对职工进行加强劳动纪律的教育；二、开展保安规程的学习，并分别不同职务和工种提出不同的要求；三、建立和健全井口检查制、交接班制、放炮员制、安全责任制、安全奖惩制、初步责任制等各种制度；四、上级已经拨款十亿元，专作保安设备之用，现在正依照计划分别进行。经过以上一系列的工作，我矿七、八两月在安全生产方面已收到初步效果。
