Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 10th: An Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman on the 8th refuted the distorted reports by U.S. news agencies regarding the remarks made by General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, at a press conference. These reports insisted that Thimayya had said that, in order to avoid a terrible massacre, Indian troops did not intend to prevent prisoners of war from "mass escapes." The spokesman said: These distorted reports created "a false impression." The spokesman said: The Indian government's copy of General Thimayya's speech at the press conference "shows that he did not make this statement, and the false impression was created because his questions and answers were not reported correctly and comprehensively."

The Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the 8th, saying that India "warmly welcomes" the "clear and straightforward statement" made by Swedish Foreign Minister Undén defending the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in Korea and refuting external criticisms.

The statement said that the Swedish Foreign Minister's statement clearly pointed out that the reckless criticisms made by the United Nations Command spokesman in Korea against the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, especially against India, were not only unfounded, but also unnecessarily "greatly complicated the already difficult work of the Commission."

    印度外交部发言人斥美方通讯社歪曲报道
    【新华社十日讯】    新德里消息：印度外交部发言人在八日驳斥了美方通讯社关于中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军在记者招待会上的谈话的歪曲报道，这些报道硬说蒂迈雅说过，为了避免可怕的屠杀，印度部队不打算阻止战俘“集体逃跑”。发言人说：这些歪曲报道造成了“一种错误的印象”。发言人说：印度政府所接到的蒂迈雅将军在记者招待会上发言的抄本，“表明，他并没有发表这个声明，错误的印象是由于没有正确和全面地把他的问答报道才产生的。”
    印度外交部在八日发表公告说，印度对瑞典外交大臣恩顿为在朝鲜的中立国遣返委员会辩护，驳斥外界的批评而发表的“明白的直率的声明，表示热烈的欢迎”。
    公告说，瑞典外交大臣的声明明白地指出了联合国军在朝鲜的发言人对中立国遣返委员会，特别是对印度所作的鲁莽的批评，不但是没有事实根据，而且不必要地“使得委员会的已属很困难的工作大大地复杂起来”。
