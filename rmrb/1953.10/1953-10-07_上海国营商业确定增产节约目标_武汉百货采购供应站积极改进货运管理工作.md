Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th: Shanghai's state-owned commercial departments are gradually launching a production increase and economy drive. The Party Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Commercial Bureau, beginning on September 17th, held a series of enlarged Party Committee meetings to specifically study how Shanghai's state-owned commercial departments could implement production increases and economies. They also proposed to all cadres and workers in Shanghai's state-owned commercial departments to expand commodity circulation by 9.5 trillion yuan, save 2.9 trillion yuan in funds, save 450 billion yuan in expenses, and over-fulfill profit remittances by 210 billion yuan on the basis of completing the original annual plan.

In order to achieve the production increase and savings tasks of Shanghai's state-owned commercial departments, the Party Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Commercial Bureau put forward specific methods for increasing production and saving: Continue to organize sources of goods and expand material exchange. When organizing sources of goods, efforts should be made to organize the production of substitutes for certain scarce commodities; when expanding sales, planned sales should be done well based on the principles of need and possibility. While continuing to pay attention to organizing sources of goods and expanding exchange, we must vigorously improve business management and reduce circulation costs. We must mobilize the masses to carefully inspect and eliminate waste in transportation, loading and unloading, warehousing, and other aspects. On the premise of ensuring reasonable reserves, capital turnover should be appropriately accelerated to save funds; however, practices of simply compressing inventory and relaxing leadership over market responsibilities should be prevented. Under the correct grasp of price policies and the principle of seeking truth from facts, ensure reasonable remittances of profits for the state to accumulate funds; however, the generation of purely profit-seeking viewpoints and profit viewpoints should be prevented.

Currently, Shanghai's state-owned companies have begun to take action. The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company and other units immediately conveyed and discussed this. The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Department Store Company has also formulated its specific plan for increasing production and saving.

According to Xinhua News Agency: Workers at the Wuhan Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station actively improved freight management, ensuring the supply of department store goods to rural areas during the peak season and reducing freight costs.

As a result of the efforts of the station's supply and transportation personnel to find solutions in various aspects, since August, the shipment time for general goods has been advanced by six or seven days compared to the past, accelerating capital turnover. In the past, the station shipped goods in the same month they were received, which often led to untimely supply, longer warehousing periods, and tied-up funds. Starting in August, supply personnel changed this approach, implementing a ten-day advance allocation of goods each month, and the time for shipping goods to many areas has been advanced by five to seven days compared to the past. Starting in August, transportation personnel rearranged the time for shipping goods to various locations according to the length of the transportation lines. Suixian and Anlu counties, which are farther from Wuhan, generally ship goods six days earlier than Honghu and other counties that are closer, changing the past phenomenon of not differentiating between near and far regions, resulting in the untimely supply to remote areas. Recently, warehouse personnel and transportation personnel at the station have changed from working in separate offices to working jointly, which has further shortened the time for handling all shipments by one day.

While ensuring fast and increased shipping, transportation personnel also paid attention to savings. In the monthly increase of total transportation volume, the proportion of higher-cost truck transportation in the total transportation volume has decreased monthly. In July, truck transportation accounted for 10% of the total transportation volume, which has decreased to 3% in August. It is estimated that this single item can save three-quarters of the freight costs.

    上海国营商业确定增产节约目标
    武汉百货采购供应站积极改进货运管理工作
    【新华社上海六日电】上海市国营商业部门增产节约运动正逐步展开。中共上海市人民政府商业局党委会自九月十七日起，连续召开了党委扩大会议，具体研究了上海市国营商业部门如何实行增产节约；并向上海市国营商业部门全体干部和职工提出了在完成原订年度计划的基础上，扩大商品流转额九万五千亿元，节约资金二万九千亿元，节省费用四千五百亿元和超额上缴利润二千一百亿元的增产节约任务。
    为了实现上海市国营商业部门的增产节约任务，中共上海市人民政府商业局党委提出了增产节约的具体办法：继续组织货源，扩大物资交流。在组织货源时对某些缺乏的商品，应设法组织代用品的生产；在扩大推销时应根据需要与可能的原则，做好计划销售。在继续注意组织货源、扩大交流的同时，要大力改善经营管理，降低流转费用。要发动群众认真检查和消灭运输、装卸、保管等方面的浪费现象。在保证合理储备的前提下，适当地加速资金周转，节约资金；但要防止单纯压缩库存放松领导市场责任的做法。在正确掌握价格政策和实事求是的原则下，保证合理的上缴利润，为国家积累资金；但要防止产生单纯的营利观点和利润观点。
    现在，上海市各国营公司已开始行动起来。中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站等单位立即进行了传达和讨论。中国百货公司上海采购供应站并已订出了该站的具体的增产节约计划。
    据新华社讯：武汉市百货采购供应站职工积极改进货运管理，保证了各地农村旺季的百货供应，并降低了货运费用。
    该站供应人员和运输人员从各方面找窍门的结果，八月以来，一般货物的发运时间比过去提前了六、七天，加速了资金周转。过去该站是当月货物当月发运，因而，供应容易不及时，仓库占压货物较久，也积压了资金。从八月份开始，供应人员改变了这种办法，实行每月提前十天拨货，许多地区发运货物的时间已经比过去提前了五天至七天。从八月开始，运输人员按运输线的长短，重新安排了各地发运货物的时间，离武汉较远的随县和安陆县要比较近的洪湖等县一般提早六天发货，改变了过去远近地区不分，偏远地区不能及时供应的现象。最近，该站仓库人员和运输人员由分散办公改为联合办公，使全部办理发运的时间又缩短了一天。
    与快运、多运同时，运输人员还注意了节约。在逐月增加的总运输量中，运费较高的汽车运输量占总运输量的比例已逐月降低。七月份汽车运输量占总运输量百分之十，八月份已降到百分之三，仅这一项，估计能节省运费四分之三。
