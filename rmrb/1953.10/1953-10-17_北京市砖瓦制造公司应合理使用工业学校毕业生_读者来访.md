Editor's Note: Since September, many visitors have reflected that some government agencies are not allocating the work of graduating students appropriately, resulting in a waste of national talent. The following opinion of Liu Liancheng, a graduate of Beijing Industrial School, on the Beijing Brick and Tile Manufacturing Company's allocation of work for graduating students is one example. We hope that the Beijing Brick and Tile Manufacturing Company will conduct an inspection and handle this matter, and we hope that other departments with similar phenomena will also pay attention to correcting this phenomenon.

    I am a graduate of Beijing Industrial School. On July 1st of this year, I and eight other classmates were assigned to work at the Beijing Brick and Tile Manufacturing Company, which is under the Beijing Municipal People's Government's Local Industry Bureau. Among our nine classmates, four studied mechanics and five studied electrical engineering. Everyone embarked on their jobs with full enthusiasm and determination to strive for the industrialization of the motherland.

    When we first arrived at the company, the company manager repeatedly exclaimed, "We need you! Too few have come this year. It would be better if more came." However, the facts we have experienced in the past three months prove that this is not the case.

    The four students assigned to the company's technical security and production departments had nothing to do all day for the first week or so. After that, they were sent to the factory to inspect the houses, wires, safety and hygiene, and the quality of the bricks, which had nothing to do with what we had learned. As a result, the head of the technical security department said, "They are just following along." When the students assigned to the Tongxian Brick and Tile Factory first arrived at the factory, the factory director, Wen Chaoyu, thought they were technicians or apprentices. Later, he found out that they were students who had studied engineering for three years. At that time, the Tongxian Brick and Tile Factory was installing a brick-making machine, so they were assigned to the installation of mechanical and electrical equipment (very simple) to learn as technicians; but in reality, they only carried and lifted things, took tools, and moved ladders every day, acting as laborers for a long time. The students who went to Doudian had no work to do at first. Later, they repeatedly asked for work, and the factory director reluctantly assigned them to the technical security section to inspect the large kilns for firing bricks.

    At the end of July, the company held a worker technical training class at the Tongxian Brick and Tile Factory, and our four mechanical engineering students were also sent to the training class. Later, because the content was not suited to our level, we were vaguely asked to be instructors. As for the five electrical engineering students, four were sent to Tongxian to participate in electrical appliance installation as apprentices; the other person became a purchasing agent for the Doudian Brick and Tile Factory. During this period, in order to change this situation of wasting manpower, we repeatedly requested the company to transfer our jobs. Until mid-August—because we were already preparing to report our opinions to the Personnel Bureau of the Beijing Municipal People's Government—Manager Cheng of the company convened a symposium with our nine people (because the notices were sent out in a disorganized manner, only six students received the notice and attended). At the meeting, the manager first emphasized that "this company needs people," and then criticized us for having "ideological problems." The meeting lasted for four hours, but nothing was resolved. After the meeting, those who were laborers continued to be laborers, and those who were idle remained idle. In late August, the machines in the Tongxian Brick and Tile Factory were installed, and the training class also ended; I couldn't even be a laborer anymore. Until September 25th, I was idle for a whole month. I asked the factory director for work three times. At first, the factory director couldn't think of anything good to do, and finally asked me to inspect the construction of the newly built factory buildings and offices. I said, "I studied mechanics, not civil engineering." He said, "Now that you have been assigned here, and the factory doesn't have suitable work to do, don't just stick to one field. Doing civil engineering is not bad either."

    Based on our experiences over the past three months, we deeply feel that the company leaders have serious departmentalism and bureaucracy, one-sidedly emphasizing the company's needs while disregarding the waste of national manpower. We request that the relevant parties pay attention to our opinions and make appropriate adjustments to our work.

### 北京市砖瓦制造公司应合理使用工业学校毕业生  ——读者来访

    北京市砖瓦制造公司应合理使用工业学校毕业生
    ——读者来访编者按：九月以来，有不少来访者反映某些机关对于毕业学生的工作分配不够恰当，以致造成浪费国家人才的现象。下面发表的北京市工业学校毕业生刘连城对北京市砖瓦制造公司分配毕业学生工作的意见即是一例。我们希望北京市砖瓦制造公司对此进行检查处理，并望其它有类似现象的部门也能注意纠正这种现象。
    我是北京市工业学校的毕业生。今年七月一日，我和其他八位同学被分配到北京市人民政府地方工业局所属的北京市砖瓦制造公司工作。我们九个同学中，四人是学机械的，五人是学电机的。每个人都怀着为祖国工业化而奋斗的满腔热情和决心，走上了工作岗位。
    我们初到公司时，公司经理满口嚷着：“需要你们哪，今年还来的太少了呢，再多些才好。”可是，三个月来我们所经历的事实却证明不是这么一回事。
    分配在公司技保、生产两科的四位同学在开头的一个多星期内终日无事可做；此后就被派下厂去检查房子电线、安全卫生和砖的质量等情况，这与我们所学的毫无关系。技保科科长因此说：“他们只是跟着跑腿的。”分配到通县砖瓦厂的同学刚到厂时，厂长温朝玉以为他们是技工或艺徒，后来才知道他们是学过三年工科的学生。这时通县砖瓦厂正在安装制砖机，便把他们派到安装机、电设备（很简单的）工程里去学技工；但实际上他们每天只去扛扛抬抬，拿拿工具，搬搬梯子，当了很久的小工。去窦店的同学开头没有工作可做，后来他们屡次要求工作，厂长才无可奈何地把他们派到技术保安股去检查烧砖的大窑。
    七月底，公司在通县砖瓦厂举办了一个工人技术训练班，我们四个学机械的同学也都被派到训练班里学习了，后来因讲的内容与我们的程度不对头，又糊糊涂涂地叫我们做了辅导员。至于那五位学电机的呢，有四个被派到通县参加电器安装，当了徒工；另外一个人则当了窦店砖瓦厂的采购员。在这一段时间里，我们为了改变这种浪费人力的情况，曾屡次要求公司调动工作。直到八月中旬——因为这时我们已经准备给北京市人民政府人事局反映意见了——公司程经理才召集我们九个人开了一次座谈会（由于通知发得很乱，只有六个同学接到通知到会）。经理在会上首先强调“本公司需要人”，然后又批评我们有“思想问题”。会议长达四小时之久，但一点问题没解决。会后，当小工的照常当小工，呆着的仍然没事做。八月下旬，通县砖瓦厂里机器安装好了，训练班也结束了；我就连小工都不能当了，一直到九月二十五日为止，整整闲了一个月。我曾三次向厂长要求工作，厂长起初提不出来做什么好，最后叫我去检查新建的厂房、办公室的施工情况。我说：“我是学机械的，不是搞土木的。”他说：“既然把你们分配来了，本厂又没合适的工作做，就别只钻一门了。搞土木工作也不坏呀。”
    根据我们三个月来的遭遇，我们深感公司领导同志存在着严重的本位主义和官僚主义，片面强调公司需要而不顾国家人力的浪费。我们要求有关方面重视我们的意见，并对我们的工作给以适当的调整。
