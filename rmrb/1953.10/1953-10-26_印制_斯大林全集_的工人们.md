    Five hundred and thirty thousand copies of the brand-new "Complete Works of Stalin," both in paperback and hardcover, are being shipped from the Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory to all parts of the country to meet the eager expectations of millions of readers.

    The glorious task of printing "The Complete Works of Stalin" first fell to the letterpress workshop, where workers eagerly volunteered for the job. In the end, a group of skilled veteran technicians was temporarily formed to handle typesetting and plate-making. The workers loudly declared: there must be no mistakes in typesetting, and the characters on the paper molds must be of consistent depth and have clear strokes. Duan Xishun, a veteran technician with 27 years of experience, was responsible for leading the work from manuscript delivery and typesetting to plate-making and printing. He, along with veteran worker Zhao Shihai, completed the revision and imposition work on time. When he thought that Stalin's theory was the weapon for the people of the whole country to participate in the great construction of the motherland, and that millions of people were waiting for the publication of this complete works, his enthusiasm for labor was even more high. The two of them were reluctant to rest at noon, taking turns to eat, and voluntarily came to work early and left late every day. The serious and intense labor of the workers in the letterpress workshop ensured the quality of the first volume of "The Complete Works of Stalin" from typesetting to casting lead plates, ensuring that not a single page was missing a single stroke, and that all punctuation marks were free of errors.

    On August 18, when the first volume of "The Complete Works of Stalin" was cast into lead plates and mounted on the printing press to begin printing, Xiong Fu, Secretary-General of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Chen Kehan, Deputy Director of the Central People's Government Publishing Administration, came to this factory, which had gloriously printed "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," to explain to the staff and workers the great significance of printing "The Complete Works of Stalin" when our country entered the period of planned economic construction, and called on the entire factory's staff and workers to better complete this glorious task. These words further encouraged the more than 500 staff and workers who were participating in the printing of "The Complete Works of Stalin." The workers immediately launched a labor emulation campaign, and a special responsibility system for handover was established between workshops and between work processes.

    Nine printing presses in the letterpress workshop, which had printed "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," were running day and night. Jin Yuquan, the leading pressman and outstanding producer of the No. 1 "Mili" printing press, recalled his vow when he rushed to print "A Brief Biography of Stalin" with grief in March this year after receiving the task. He and other workers in the group repeatedly pondered and proposed an advanced working method of "frequent plate brushing, frequent glue washing, and frequent inspection," which finally ensured that this printing press did not produce a single defective product in two months of printing. Seeing that the paper was hard and the quality requirements were high, and that each plate mounting took too long, the workers came up with a method of mutual exchange of five machines. When one machine was mounting a plate, the other four machines were temporarily operated by auxiliary workers, and the leading pressmen all went to assist that machine, giving full play to the power of the collective. In this way, work efficiency was rapidly improved, and the original 12 hours required for each plate mounting was shortened to four and a half hours, while ensuring high quality. The No. 4 "Mili" printing press created a new record of printing 15,200 full sheets every eight hours in its work. Thanks to the "continuous paper feeding method" created by the workers for the paper feeder of the printing press, physical fatigue was reduced, which not only improved quality and reduced skewed pages, but also increased output. On October 19, they completed the printing of 530,000 copies of the first volume of "The Complete Works of Stalin" eight days ahead of schedule.

    The last workshop that the finished product passed through before leaving the factory was the binding workshop. The staff and workers here showed even more intense emotions. The bookbinding machines kept clicking, and the female workers of the inspection team concentrated on reading the books for the final inspection. "No defective products will be allowed to leave the factory" was their common slogan. Zhong Huiyun, a female worker in the collating group, has been insisting on working with leg pain since hearing the mobilization report on August 18. When others advised her to rest, she always thought: I am a party member, and I must take the lead in completing this glorious task, so that the people of the whole country can better master Stalin's theory for construction as soon as possible. In the process of persisting in work while ill, she also continued to improve work efficiency, increasing the number of pages collated per day from 700 to 900. In the middle and upper旬 of October, the cutting team mobilized all the workers in the group to find tricks and think of ways to improve the organization of labor and shorten the downtime of the machines, and successively won four "good news", creating a new record of cutting 27,000 books per day with a three-sided book cutting machine, more than doubling the original plan. The rejection rate decreased from one in 100,000 for printing general books to one in 700,000, ensuring that an average of 10,000 brand-new copies of the first volume of "The Complete Works of Stalin" were shipped from the factory every day from September 15.

    The Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory has now received the glorious task of printing the second volume of "The Complete Works of Stalin," and the workers have excitedly expressed their greater determination: to continue to give full play to their serious and full labor enthusiasm, to print the second volume of "The Complete Works of Stalin," and to make every book of the best quality, published on schedule, and delivered to the people of the whole country in a timely manner.

    印制“斯大林全集”的工人们
    新华社记者  孙世恺
    五十三万册平装和精装的崭新的“斯大林全集”第一卷，正从北京新华印刷厂陆续出厂送往全国各地，以满足全国千万个热诚的读者的渴望。
    印制“斯大林全集”的光荣任务首先到了活版车间，工人们都争先表示愿担负这一工作。最后还是由技术熟练的老技工们临时组成一个组，进行排字和制版。工人们响亮地提出：排字不出一点错，打纸型的字要深浅一致，笔道清楚。有二十七年工龄的老技工段希舜除了具体负责领导从发稿排字到制版付印这段工作外，还和老工人赵世海按时完成改版和拚版工作。当他想到斯大林的理论就是全国人民参加祖国大建设的武器，千万人在等待着这一全集的出版时，劳动热情更加高涨。他们两人中午都不肯休息，换着班去吃饭，每天自动提前上班和晚下班。活版车间工人们的严肃而紧张的劳动，保证了“斯大林全集”第一卷从排字到铸铅版的质量，使全书没有一页出现缺少一个笔道的毛病，所有的标点符号都一无差误。
    八月十八日，“斯大林全集”第一卷铸成铅版装上印刷机开始付印时，中共中央宣传部秘书长熊复，中央人民政府出版总署副署长陈克寒来到这个曾光荣印制“毛泽东选集”的厂里，向职工们说明当我国进入有计划经济建设时期印制“斯大林全集”的重大意义，号召全厂职工更好地完成这个光荣的任务。这些话更加鼓舞了正在参加印制“斯大林全集”的五百多名职工。工人们立即展开了一个劳动竞赛，车间与车间、工序与工序之间都建立起交接专责制。
    铅印车间曾印制“毛泽东选集”的九部印刷机日夜不停地转动着。一号“米力”印刷机的领机工、优等生产者金玉全接到任务后，想起了今年三月间怀着悲痛心情赶印“斯大林传略”时自己的誓言，就和小组其他工友共同反复琢磨，提出“勤刷版、勤洗胶、勤检查”的先进工作法，终于使这部印刷机在两个月的印刷中没出过一本次品。工人们看到因纸硬和质量要求高，每次上版误时太长，就想出五个机实行联互换作的办法。当一个机器上版时，其他四个机器由辅助工暂时操作，领机工都去协助那个机器，发挥集体的力量。这样工作效率迅速提高，原先每次上版需十二小时，现在缩短到四小时半，又保证了高度的质量。四号“米力”印刷机在工作中，创造了每八小时印刷一万五千二百全张的新纪录。由于工人们创造了印刷机续纸的“连环续纸法”，减少了体力疲劳，不仅提高了质量减少了歪页，而且也增加了产量。他们在十月十九日按计划提前八天印完了五十三万本“斯大林全集”第一卷。
    成品出厂前经过的最后一个车间是装订车间。这里的职工们表现了更加紧张的情绪。订书机不停地答答响着，检查组的女工聚精会神地翻阅书本做最后一次检查工作，“不让一本次品出厂”是她们共同的口号。配页组女工钟慧云从八月十八日听到动员报告后，一直带着腿痛病坚持工作到现在。别人劝她休息时，她总想到：自己是个党员，一定得带头完成这次光荣任务，好尽快让全国人民更好掌握斯大林的学说来进行建设。在带病坚持工作中，她还不断提高工作效率，每天配页由七百本增加到九百本。切成组在十月上、中旬发动全组工人找窍门想办法，改善了劳动组织，缩短机器的中断时间，连续得了四次“喜报”，创造了三面切书机日裁二万七千本的新纪录，超过原计划一倍多。废品率由印制一般书籍的十万分之一降到七十万分之一，确保从九月十五日起每天平均有一万本崭新的“斯大林全集”第一卷出厂。
    北京新华印刷厂现已接到印制“斯大林全集”第二卷的光荣任务，工人们都兴奋地表示了更大的决心：继续发挥严肃而饱满的劳动热情，印制出
    “斯大林全集”第二卷，并使每本书都做到质量最好，按期出版，及时送到全国人民的面前。
