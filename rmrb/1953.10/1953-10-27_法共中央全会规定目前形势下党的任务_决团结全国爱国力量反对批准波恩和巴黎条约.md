Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 25th: According to TASS, the French Communist Party Central Committee's plenary session has adopted a resolution stipulating the Party's tasks in the current domestic and international situation. The characteristic of the current French political situation is the active struggle of the masses, the improvement of their political consciousness, and the achievements made in the united action of the working class.

The resolution pointed out: The strength and influence of the peace and democracy camp are constantly increasing. The French people increasingly believe that the Soviet people and the Soviet government are friends of France, that the Soviet Union is implementing an international peace policy, and that it respects the sovereignty and equality of all nations.

The resolution pointed out that the so-called "European Army" is just an absurd excuse for reviving the German Wehrmacht and condemned the conspiracy of the American reactionaries: to drag Franco's Spain into their camp, to obstruct the final peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and to try their best to expand the Vietnam War.

The resolution said: Under these circumstances, vigilance must be heightened and the struggle must be strengthened. The struggle of the French people must be further strengthened, and people from broader strata must be united to ensure that the Bonn and Paris treaties are rejected, that the Indochina War is immediately stopped, and that all disputes between major powers are peacefully resolved.

The resolution pointed out: Workers' demands for united action are increasing day by day. Despite the opposition of the Socialist Party leaders, Socialists and Communists have made many achievements in establishing a united front.

The resolution continued: Our Party faces many important issues. It must fight with all its strength: to save our country and world peace from the deadly threat of the infamous European Defense Community; to save our republic from fascist reactionaries; to save our culture from barbaric obscurantism; and to improve the living standards of the working masses and the middle class in urban and rural areas. To achieve this goal, the Party must organize the working class and all other working people, including peasants, intellectuals, women and youth, to carry out a universal struggle.

The resolution pointed out: The French Communist Party has always adhered to the principles of establishing socialism. It knows that the unity of all patriotic forces can bring about a complete change in French policy. The Communist Party is determined to spare no effort in preventing the Bonn and Paris treaties from being ratified in the parliament and throughout the country. Today, this issue is the key issue. Therefore, the Party is prepared to unite with those who oppose these two treaties to smash these two treaties and defeat the initiators and supporters of the "European Army".

    法共中央全会规定目前形势下党的任务
    决团结全国爱国力量反对批准波恩和巴黎条约
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十五日讯：法国共产党中央委员会的全体会议通过了一项决议，规定目前国内外形势下党的任务。目前法国政治形势的特点是群众斗争的活跃，他们的政治觉悟的提高以及工人阶级的一致行动取得的成就。
    决议指出：和平民主阵营的力量和影响在不断加强，法国人民日益相信苏联人民和苏联政府是法国的朋友，相信苏联在执行着国际和平政策，并且尊重各民族的主权与平等。
    决议指出所谓“欧洲军”只是复活德国国防军的荒谬藉口，并且谴责了美国反动集团的阴谋：把佛朗哥西班牙拉入他们的阵营，阻挠朝鲜问题的最后和平解决，竭力扩大越南战争。
    决议说：在这种情况下，必须提高警惕，加强斗争。法国人民的斗争必须进一步加强，必须团结更广泛阶层的人民，才能确保波恩和巴黎条约遭到拒绝，才能使印度支那战争立即停止，使大国间的所有争端得到和平解决。
    决议指出：工人对行动一致的要求日益强烈，尽管社会党领袖反对，社会党人和共产党人在成立联合战线方面还是取得了很多成就。
    决议接着说：我们的党面临着许多重大问题。它必须以全力进行斗争：从恶名昭彰的欧洲防务集团的致命威胁中拯救我们的国家和世界和平；从法西斯反动派手中拯救我们的共和国；从野蛮的蒙昧主义中拯救我们的文化；提高城乡劳动群众和中产阶级的生活水平。为达到这个目的，党必须组织工人阶级和其他一切劳动人民，包括农民、知识分子、妇女和青年，进行普遍的斗争。
    决议指出：法国共产党始终坚守建立社会主义的原则。它知道，所有爱国力量团结一致能够使法国政策全部改变。共产党已下定决心，要不遗余力地在议会和全国不让波恩和巴黎条约获得批准。在今天，这个问题是关键问题。所以党准备与反对这两个条约的人们联合起来，粉碎这两个条约，击败“欧洲军”的发起者和支持者。
