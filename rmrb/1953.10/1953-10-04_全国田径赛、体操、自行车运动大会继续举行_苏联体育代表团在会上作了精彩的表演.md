The white doves flew in the blue sky, and the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause that lasted for a long time.

After Chai Zemin, Director of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Sports Commission, delivered a welcoming speech, A. Gramadsky, the head of the Soviet Sports Delegation, delivered a speech. He first extended his sincere and fraternal greetings to the Chinese athletes on behalf of the Soviet sports athletes. He said that we feel extremely honored that the Soviet Sports Delegation can perform in the People's Republic of China. Our performance and our mutual exchange of sports experience will further consolidate the great friendship and unbreakable alliance between the people of the Soviet Union and China.

Their speeches were repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause from the audience.

The gymnastics performance began. The sixteen programs performed by these meritorious athletes and sports masters, who had won the absolute championship of the Soviet Union in gymnastics or the absolute championship of the 15th Olympic Games and the sports competitions of the 4th World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival, were all very wonderful. Konovalova, Bocharova, Sharobidze, Ruzhiko, and others performed on the balance beam and uneven bars, receiving enthusiastic praise from the audience.
