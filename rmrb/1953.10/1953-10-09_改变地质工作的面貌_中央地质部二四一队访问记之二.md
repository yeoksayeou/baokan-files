    Changing the Face of Geological Work
    – A Visit to the Central Geological Department's Team 241 (Part 2)
    Fan Rongkang
    We sat in the room of Yan Kunyuan, the deputy captain of Team 241. The room was small and low; it served as the office of this geological engineer, as well as his bedroom. Naturally, meals and receiving guests also had to be arranged in this room.
    This was a morning in August. The sun had long since dispersed the morning fog wandering on the grassland. The workers on the night shift had just come down from the drilling rig. Geologists, surveyors, and comrades from the geophysical exploration team had already set off. The repair shop continuously emitted the sound of machines turning, breaking the tranquility after the departure of the large contingent on the grassland.
    Yan Kunyuan handled some matters, took a breath, and sat down next to us, explaining, "Before Soviet expert Korotki left, he pointed out many errors in our work. Therefore, much work needs to be re-arranged."
    To discuss these errors in Team 241's geological work, and how Team 241 would reconsider their geological work due to Korotki's timely instructions, it is necessary to talk about Team 241's development and achievements over the past three years, and especially about this geological engineer. This is not only because he was the first to arrive on this grassland three years ago, but also because he is the main geological engineer of Team 241.
    Yan Kunyuan has been engaged in geological work for twenty years. For a long period, he only repeated a monotonous life year after year. In the spring, he would set off silently with a cloth bag on his back, a hammer in his hand, and a few college students. When it was cold, he would return indoors to sort out the materials and write a report. The next year, he would set off to a new field. There were no other exploration methods to confirm his inferences about the ore body, and in fact, there was no need to confirm it, because no one knew when these mining areas would be mined.
      Decades passed like this. Yan Kunyuan never thought his life would change so much. However, in 1949, the People's Republic of China was born, and the new China brought new tasks to geological workers.
      In 1950, Yan Kunyuan came to the grassland with a group of college students. That winter, many people thought this work had ended, and in 1951 they would go to a new area. However, something unexpected happened. The state put forward new requirements for geological work: requiring geological work to provide accurate data for industrial construction. Yan Kunyuan and others' work in 1950 was still far from accurately calculating mineral reserves. They had only taken the first step and had to continue.
    Thus, until 1953, they continued to work on this grassland. The face of geological work changed. The number of people increased dozens of times. The geology section alone had about a hundred people. In addition to geologists, there were many workers operating dozens of drilling rigs, a geophysical exploration team, a laboratory, and even a repair shop and a motorcade. Team 241 was a giant comprehensive exploration team. What was placed before Yan Kunyuan was no longer a cloth bag, a hammer, and two or three students, but a modernized joint force. To organize such a large team and substantially change the face of geological work was an extremely difficult task.
    Yan Kunyuan recalled the situation at the time: "The experience of Soviet geological exploration work was introduced to China very late. When we started working, we indeed had individualistic ideas, each doing our own thing. Therefore, it was difficult to organize various exploration efforts together."
    In the initial longer period, geologists did not pay much attention to drilling. In theory, drilling is to confirm the geologist's inferences about the ore body, and it is the main data for calculating mineral reserves. Geologists should use drilling data to confirm and enrich their inferences about the ore body. But in the beginning, there were no fixed geological personnel to contact the drilling rigs. Geologists did not look at the shift reports recording the conditions of the drilling underground, did not check the length of the core, did not track down the remaining core, and there was no way to deal with the wrong position of the core. Because of the lack of concern for drilling, it was impossible to judge the underground conditions from various reactions of the drilling rig. For example, is there a fault where there is water leakage or where the core recovery rate is particularly low? If the drilling speed suddenly changes, has the drill bit passed through one rock layer into another? No one studied this important underground information. No one cared about how representative the columnar diagrams drawn based on very little and messy core were.
      At that time, geologists thought, "Drilling is drilling, an engineering problem, and it has little to do with us." Geologists assigned to do drilling work considered it a work without academic significance, "making a big talent do a small job." It was not until August last year, under the guidance of Soviet experts, that this situation began to change. But it was only when geological personnel explained to the workers the geological conditions that this drill hole might encounter when each drilling rig started drilling. Even the significance of each drill hole and its role in calculating mineral reserves were not made clear, so that the workers of drill holes 9 and 13, which were arranged on the edge of the ore body to determine the zero-point boundary line of the ore body, thought that these two drill holes were wasted after only drilling into a very thin ore layer. It was not until the beginning of this year, after studying Soviet experience at the National Geological Workers Conference, that the geology section of Team 241 established a drilling supervision team, and truly began to change the disconnect between geology and drilling. The drilling supervision team had a large number of interns and trainees, who formed several teams to be responsible for contacting various drilling rigs.
    From this perspective, the geologists of Team 241 embodied the purpose of their work, but the purpose of geological work is not only reflected in this aspect, it runs through the guiding ideology and specific deployment of the entire geological exploration work. This is one of the main opinions raised by Soviet expert Korotki to Team 241.
    Taking the West Mine as an example, initially, the geologists of Team 241 saw very few outcrops of the West Mine and a thick layer of overburden, and were not sure whether there was really ore underground. Because of this, they invited the geophysical exploration team this year. The geophysical exploration team used magnetic exploration methods to discover a large area of strong magnetic properties in the West Mine. Apart from magnetite, ordinary rocks are difficult to have such magnetism. The geophysical exploration team inferred that the West Mine might be a very considerable magnetite area. However, the geologists of Team 241 did not pay attention to this discovery of the geophysical exploration team. When deploying the work of the West Mine, they put aside the inference of the geophysical exploration team, and mistakenly requested that the West Mine conduct mine area exploration work this year, map the geological map at a scale of 1:2500, and install the drilling rig near the outcrop in order to find the ore reserves at the outcrop. Korotki pointed out: This deployment was completely wrong. The West Mine does not yet have the conditions for mine area exploration. It can only do mine area prospecting. The drilling rig should not be installed near the outcrop, but should be installed in the area where the geophysical exploration team believes the magnetism is strongest, to confirm the geophysical exploration's inference. The geological map at a scale of 1:2500 cannot be mapped under the condition of few outcrops and no drilling data. A geological map at a scale of 1:10,000 should be made.
    The error in the geological exploration deployment of the West Mine is an important lesson. It shows that the purpose of geological work should not just be a good wish to find mineral deposits. Under this general purpose, at a certain period and under certain conditions, there should be certain steps and different requirements. Otherwise, it is difficult to achieve the goal of accurately calculating mineral reserves. As Soviet experts said, "Geological exploration work is science, technology, and art." But it is also wrong to think that it is very mysterious. The procedures of Soviet geological exploration work and the method of graded calculation of mineral reserves are precisely a broad road.
    Korotki not only pointed out the path of geological exploration work in the West Mine, but also put forward many opinions on the geological exploration work of the Main Mine, the East Mine, and the entire mining area. Team 241 considered arranging drill lines at certain proportional distances, but did not consider what role each drill hole plays in the entire exploration work, so that the distance between drill holes in the place where the ore body is very thick is the same as in the area where the ore body is very thin, which resulted in the place where the drill line should be dense being sparse, and the place where it should be sparse being dense. A lot of work has been done on the Main Mine, but there is no geological map at a scale of 1:2500 in this year's plan, and many geological problems in the Main Mine cannot be clarified. Korotki also pointed out: It is correct to concentrate the power in the known mining area, but why has the line of sight been so narrow for a long time? Why not take some time to do a large area survey? Is it possible that such a large mine is completely isolated and cannot be developed elsewhere?
      Korotki's questioning made everyone feel infinitely happy, what a profound enlightenment, it produces a force, encouraging everyone to move forward in a new direction.
    These errors and shortcomings of Team 241 have created such a situation: Much work has been done in the past three years, and a lot of data has been collected, but due to the disorganized and partial work, and the lack of research and collation of the data, the geologists' understanding of this mining area is still at the initial level. It is still the same saying: "The mine is very large and very promising," but no one can answer how big it is, what is the quality, what is the structure of the mining area, the ore body, and whether there are other possibilities for the genesis of the deposit.
      When Yan Kunyuan talked to me, Korotki had already left Team 241. However, what Yan Kunyuan told me was still Korotki's instructions. The workers also often talked to us about the deep impression Korotki left on them.
    But Korotki is not only familiar with geology, but also with drilling, and he seems to know a lot about geophysical exploration. He instructed the geophysical exploration team to further use the resistivity meter to test the thickness of the overburden in the West Mine and understand the underground structure. He also suggested using electric logging methods to supplement the underground conditions in drill holes with particularly low core recovery rates. Korotki repeatedly asked Team 241 whether it had explored various steelmaking fluxes. He said: "Without these data, the industrial sector cannot make mining designs." He also asked Yan Kunyuan several times: "If a city of 100,000 people is built here in the future, where will you supply water from?" It seems that Korotki is also considering urban construction very carefully.
    These inferences together make people think of the comprehensiveness of geological work that the Soviet Union has repeatedly emphasized.
    Speaking of comprehensiveness, Yan Kunyuan shook his head and said: "We are even worse in this regard. Korotki made several comments to me in this regard last year, but I didn't understand them deeply. Limestone has been discovered, but it has not been explored. The quantity and quality have not been clarified, and to be honest, I know very little about steelmaking knowledge. The same is true for hydrogeology. Experts mentioned it earlier, but we didn't do it, and we didn't know how to do it." After a while, he said, "We will start doing it this year. Without these data, the report cannot be submitted before the end of the year."
    When I left Team 241, the geology section of Team 241 was ending a five-day ideological summary. The purpose of this ideological summary was to unify thinking, strengthen unity, and meet new tasks. On the last day of the summary, Yan Kunyuan reported the new work deployment and new organizational division of labor formulated according to Korotki's instructions.
    They will achieve new victories in changing the face of geological work. (Attached picture)

    改变地质工作的面貌
    ——中央地质部二四一队访问记之二
    范荣康
    我们坐在二四一队副队长严坤元的屋子里，这屋子很小，也很矮；它既是这位地质工程师的办公室，又是寝室，自然，吃饭和接待客人也不得不安排在这间屋子里。
    这是八月里的一个早晨，太阳早就冲散了游荡在草原上的晨雾。晚班的工人刚从钻机上下来，地质工作者、测量工作者和物理探矿队的同志们已经出发了，修配间里连续不断地发出机器转动的声音，划破这草原上大队人马出发后的冷静。
    严坤元处理了一些事情，缓了一口气，挨着我们坐下来，解释说：“苏联专家柯罗特基走以前，指出了我们工作中的许多错误，因此，许多工作要重新布置。”
    要谈二四一队地质工作中的这些错误，以及由于柯罗特基及时的指示，二四一队将怎样重新考虑他们的地质工作，就不得不谈起二四一队这三年来的发展和成绩，特别是不得不谈起这位地质工程师，这不仅因为他是三年前最早来到这草原上的，更因为他是二四一队主要的地质工程师。
    严坤元从事地质工作已经整整二十年了。在很长的时期里，他只是一年又一年地重复着单调的生活。春天里，背上布袋，拿着锤子，带了几个大学生默默地出发了。到寒冷的时候，回到室内整理一下材料，写一篇报告。第二年又出发到新的野外去。没有别的勘探方法来证实他对矿体的推断，事实上也没有需要去证实它；因为谁也不知道这些矿区什么年头才能够开采。
      十几年的功夫就这样过去了，严坤元没有想到这一生的生活会有多大的变化。可是，一九四九年，人民的中国诞生了，新中国给地质工作人员带来了新的任务。
      一九五零年，严坤元带着一批大学生来到草原上。这一年冬天，许多人认为这段工作已经结束了，一九五一年他们将到新的地区去。可是，想不到的事情发生了。国家对地质工作提出新的要求：要求地质工作为工业建设提供准确的资料。严坤元等一九五零年的工作距离精确的计算矿量还很遥远。他们只走了第一步，而必须继续走下去。
    这样，一直到一九五三年，他们始终工作在这个草原上。地质工作的面貌改变了，人数是几十倍地增加，单是地质科就有一百人左右，除了地质工作者，还有操作着数十台钻机的许多工人，物理探矿队，化验室，以至修配间，汽车队。二四一队是一个巨型的综合勘探队了。摆在严坤元面前的，已不是一个布袋，一把锤子和三两个学生，而是一个近代化的联合兵团。要把这样大的队伍组织起来，在实质上改变地质工作的面貌，这是万分艰难的任务。
    严坤元回忆当时的情形说：“苏联地质勘探工作的经验介绍到中国来是很迟的。我们在开始工作的时候，确实有单干思想，各搞各的。因此，一到要把各种勘探工作组织起来就难了。”
    在最初的一段较长时期内，地质工作者是不大关心钻探的。说起来，钻探是为了证实地质工作者对矿体的推断，是计算矿量的主要资料，地质工作者应该从钻探资料里来证实和丰富自己对矿体的推断。但在最初的时候，没有固定的地质人员去和钻机联系。地质人员不看记载钻机钻入地下的情况的班报表，不检查岩心长度，不追查余存的岩心，岩心位置错了也没有办法。由于不关怀钻探，就无法从钻机的各种反映来判断地下的情况。例如：漏水，或者是岩心采取率特别低的地方，是不是有断层呢？钻进速度突然变化了，是不是钻头已穿过一种岩层进入另一种岩层？这些重要的地下情报，没有人去研究。根据很少很乱的岩心绘制的柱状图有多少代表性，也没有人过问。
      那时候，地质人员是这样想：“钻探是钻探，是工程问题，和我们关系不大”，被分配去作看钻工作的地质人员认为这是一种没有学术意义的工作，是“大才小用”。到了去年八月，经过苏联专家的指导，才开始改变这种情况。但也只是每部钻机开钻的时候，由地质人员向工人讲解一下这个钻眼可能遇到的地质情况，甚至连每个钻眼的意义及其在计算矿量中所起的作用都没有交代清楚，以致布置在矿体边缘，目的是决定矿体零点边界线的九眼和十三眼的工人，在仅钻到很薄的矿层后，就认为这两个钻眼是浪费了。一直到今年年初，在全国地质工作人员会议上学习了苏联经验后，二四一队地质科成立了看钻队，才真正开始着手改变地质和钻探的脱节现象。看钻队拥有一大批实习员和练习生，组成几个小队，分别负责联系各个钻机。
    从这方面说：二四一队的地质工作者体现了他们工作的目的性，但地质工作的目的性并不只表现在这方面，它贯穿在整个地质勘探工作的指导思想和具体部署上。这就是苏联专家柯罗特基对二四一队提出的主要意见之一。
    拿西矿来说，最初，二四一队地质工作者看见西矿的露头很少，浮土覆盖层很厚，对地下是否真的有矿是没有把握的。因为这样，今年他们把物理探矿队请来了。物理探矿队用磁力探测的方法发现西矿有一大片磁性很强的地区，除了磁铁矿，一般的岩石是难有这样的磁性的。物理探矿队推断，西矿可能是一个非常可观的磁铁矿区。可是，二四一队的地质工作者没有重视物理探矿队的这个发现，他们在部署西矿的工作时，把物理探矿队的推断搁在一旁，并错误地要求西矿今年就进行矿区勘探工作，测制二千五百分之一的地质图，并把钻机安在露头附近以求露头处的矿量。柯罗特基指出：这个部署完全错误了，西矿还没有具备矿区勘探的条件，它还只能做矿区普查，钻机不应该安在露头附近，而应该安在物理探矿队认为磁性最强的地区，以证实物理探矿的推断，而二千五百分之一的地质图在这种露头很少，没有钻探资料的情况下是无法测制的，应该制的是一万分之一的地质图。
    西矿地质勘探工作部署的错误是一个重要的教训。它说明地质工作的目的性不应该只是一个找寻矿床的良好愿望。在这个总的目的下，一定的时期，一定的条件，应该有一定的步骤和不同的要求。否则，是难以达到精确计算矿量的目的的。正如苏联专家所说：“地质勘探工作是科学、是技术，也是艺术。”但如果认为它非常玄奥，那也是不对的。苏联地质勘探工作的程序以及分级计算矿量的方法正是一条康庄大道。
    柯罗特基不仅指明了西矿地质勘探工作的道路，而且对主矿、东矿和整个矿区的地质勘探工作提出不少意见。二四一队考虑到按一定比例的距离布置排钻线，却没有考虑到每一个钻眼究竟在整个勘探工作中起什么作用，以致在矿体很厚的地方钻眼的距离和矿体很薄的地区是一样的，这就造成排钻线应该密的地方很疏，应该疏的地方很密。主矿的工作做了不少，可是今年的计划里却没有二千五百分之一的地质图，主矿地质上的许多问题没法搞清楚。柯罗特基又指出：把力量集中在已知矿区是正确的，可是为什么长时期内视线一直那样狭小呢？为什么不抽出一点时间去作大区域的普查？难道这样大的矿是完全孤立的，不可能再向别处发展？
      柯罗特基的询问使大家感到无限喜悦，多么深刻的启示啊，它产生一种力量，鼓舞大家循着新的方向前进。
    二四一队的这些错误和缺点，造成这样一个情况：三年来做了许多工作，收集了许多资料，但由于工作的零乱、局部，和缺乏对资料的研究整理，地质工作者对这个矿区的认识还停留在最初的水平上。依然是那样的话：“矿很大，很有希望”，可是究竟有多大，质量究竟怎样，矿区构造、矿体情况、矿床成因有没有别的可能，谁也答不上。
      严坤元和我谈话的时候，柯罗特基早已离开了二四一队了。可是，严坤元告诉我的还是柯罗特基的指示。工人们也常向我们谈起柯罗特基留给他们的深刻印象。
    但是柯罗特基不仅熟悉地质，也不仅熟悉钻探，他对物理探矿看来也懂得不少。他指示物理探矿队要进一步使用电阻仪，在西矿测验浮土覆盖的厚度和了解地下的构造情况，他还建议用电测井的方法，在岩心采取率特别低的钻眼里补测地下的情况。柯罗特基一再询问二四一队是否勘探过各种炼钢的熔剂。他说：“没有这些资料，工业部门是没法作开采设计的。”他又曾几次问严坤元：“如果将来这里建设一座十万人的城市，你从那里供水？”看来，柯罗特基对城市建设也考虑得很周到。
    这些推测加在一起，就使人想起苏联所一再强调的地质工作的综合性。
    谈起综合性，严坤元摇摇头说：“我们在这方面更差，柯罗特基去年就在这方面向我提过几次意见，我体会不深。石灰岩是发现了，并没有去勘探，数量、质量都没有搞清楚，而且老实说，炼钢的知识我也懂得很少。水文地质也是这样，专家早提过，我们没有做，也不知怎么做”。隔了一会，他说：“今年要着手做了，没有这些资料，年底以前报告送交不出去的。”
    我离开二四一队的时候，二四一队地质科正结束了为期五天的思想总结。这次思想总结的目的在于统一思想，加强团结，迎接新的任务。这总结的最后一天，严坤元报告了根据柯罗特基的指示所拟订的新的工作部署和新的组织分工。
    他们将在改变地质工作的面貌中取得新的胜利。(附图片)
