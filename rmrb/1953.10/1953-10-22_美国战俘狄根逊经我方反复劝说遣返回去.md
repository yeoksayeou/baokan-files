　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 21st: An American prisoner of war, Dickenson, under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, had his request for repatriation approved and was repatriated today at Panmunjom. This American prisoner of war insisted on staying on this side while under the custody of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, despite repeated efforts by the Korean-Chinese side to persuade him to return to the United States.

　　In accordance with the policy of repatriating all prisoners of war, the Korean-Chinese side persuaded Dickenson more than ten times to return with the directly repatriated prisoners of war. Other prisoners of war with him also tried to persuade him to go home, but to no avail. Dickenson insisted on staying on this side, and the Korean-Chinese side told him that he could still exercise his right to be repatriated during the period of supervision by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

　　The Korean-Chinese side’s policy of repatriating all prisoners of war stands in sharp contrast to the US policy of using Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee's secret agents to control prisoners of war, preventing them from applying for and daring to apply for repatriation. In the camps in the southern sector of the demilitarized zone, Syngman Rhee's secret agents prevented Korean prisoners of war from coming out to listen to explanations and exercise their right to be repatriated. Hamblen, the head of the US "repatriation group," openly stated that he would fight for the "victory" of preventing all Korean-Chinese prisoners of war from returning home.

    美国战俘狄根逊经我方反复劝说遣返回去
    【新华社开城二十一日电】在中立国遣返委员会看管下的一个美国战俘狄根逊申请遣返的要求被批准了，他今天在板门店被遣返。这个美国战俘在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军看管下时，坚持留在这边，虽然朝中方面一再努力说服他回到美国去。
    朝中方面按照遣返全部战俘的政策，曾向狄根逊劝说了十余次，要他和直接遣返的战俘们一起回去。和他在一起的其他战俘劝他回家去，也没有效果。狄根逊坚持要留在这边，朝中方面告诉他，在中立国遣返委员会看管期间，他仍可以行使被遣返的权利。
    朝中方面的遣返全部战俘的政策，与美国使用蒋介石和李承晚特务来控制战俘使他们不能和不敢申请遣返的政策，形成鲜明的对比。在非军事区南部看管区的营房中，李承晚特务阻止朝鲜籍战俘出来听取解释和行使他们被遣返的权利。美方“遣返组”组长汉布伦公然说：他将为争取不让所有朝中战俘回家的“胜利”而斗争。
