    Beijing 3753 Construction Site Has Substandard Construction and Very Poor Engineering Quality
    —Reader's Visit
    Editor's Note: On October 3rd, Comrade Zhao Wenyan from the Engineering Department of the Beijing Institute of Technology visited our newspaper's reader's letters group, criticizing the leadership of the Beijing Seventh Construction Engineering Company's 3753 construction site for neglecting project quality and for substandard construction. His views are published below, and we hope that the Beijing Seventh Construction Engineering Company and the leadership of the 3753 construction site will inspect and correct the problems.
    "Quality First, the Plan of Century" is a principle that must be firmly adhered to in the current capital construction. However, the 3753 construction site of the Beijing Seventh Construction Engineering Company, which is contracted to build the dormitory building of the Beijing Institute of Technology, has not followed this principle well.
    During construction, the site actually mixed a large amount of soil into the foundations. Once, we found lumps of yellow soil 40 cm long and 8 cm thick and limestone with a diameter of 7.5 cm in the foundation. We asked the site director to improve operations, but the site constructor, Lin Zhiyuan, actually ordered the workers to destroy the original cross-section that had been checked and smeared the mixed yellow soil with whitewash in an attempt to deceive us.
    In reinforced concrete projects, according to regulations, steel bar joints should not be tied at the place of maximum leverage, and each section should not exceed 25%. However, the site tied the steel bar joints exactly at the point of maximum leverage, and on the same section, every other bar was joined, equaling 50% of the joints on one section, exceeding the prescribed limit by 100%. According to regulations, the mud content of sand used for reinforced concrete should not exceed 5%; however, the sand currently used on the site has a mud content as high as 8% to 10% after verification. After the concrete is poured, according to regulations, it should be watered continuously for at least five days; however, the site stopped watering in order to save the wages of four strong laborers for two days, which amounted to no more than 60,000 yuan.
    What is especially intolerable is that the person in charge of the construction site has an extremely careless attitude towards the construction of the building's pillars. This four-story building has only four pillars. Five days before the steel bars were erected and the formwork was installed, we asked the responsible comrades at the construction site to clean the steel bars and remove the debris accumulated at the bottom of the pillars before installing the formwork. However, when we inspected, we dug out many pieces of wood, broken bricks, whitewash debris, and other debris from the bottom of each pillar. In one of the pillars, we even dug out a wooden stick 46 cm long, 5 cm wide, and 2.5 cm thick. The entire project has only four reinforced concrete pillars, and the responsible comrades at the construction site were so careless. This is a very dangerous thing!
    The reason for the above situation is mainly that the leading cadres at the construction site only pursued progress and "savings" during construction, while forgetting the quality of the project. As everyone knows, ensuring project quality is the greatest saving in capital construction. In particular, there are only a few dozen working days left this year. If the project quality is poor and rework is required, not only will materials be wasted, but the loss of time will be incalculable. It is hoped that the leaders of the construction site will correct their erroneous thinking of not paying attention to project quality, and promptly and conscientiously inspect and improve their work.

### 北京市三七五三工地施工不合标准工程质量很坏——读者来访

    北京市三七五三工地施工不合标准工程质量很坏
    ——读者来访
    编者按：十月三日，北京工业学院工程处赵文彦同志来访本报读者来信组，批评北京市第七建筑工程公司三七五三工地领导方面忽视工程质量，施工不合标准。兹将他的意见发表如下，希望北京市第七建筑工程公司及三七五三工地领导方面检查纠正。
    “百年大计，质量第一”，这是目前基本建设中应坚决遵守的一个原则。可是，北京市建筑工程局第七建筑工程公司承包北京工业学院宿舍大楼工程的三七五三工地，却没有很好地遵守这个原则。
    该工地施工时竟在基础中掺入大量的土块。有一次我们查出基础中有四十公分长、八公分厚的黄土块和直径七公分半大的石灰石，要求工地主任改进操作；但是工地施工员林志远竟指挥工人将被查出的原断面挖毁，并在夹杂的黄土块上涂抹白灰，企图蒙骗过去。
    在钢筋混凝土工程中，按照规定，绑钢筋接头不应在力距最大的地方，并且每一个断面不应超过百分之二十五。但该工地绑钢筋接头正在力距最大处，并在同一个断面上隔一根接一根，等于一个断面的接头百分之五十，超过了规定限度的一倍。打筑钢筋混凝土所用的沙子，按规定含泥量不应超过百分之五；但现在工地所用的沙子，经核验含泥量高达百分之八至百分之十。在混凝土打筑以后，按照规定应至少连续浇水五天；但该工地为了节省支出四个壮工两天的不过六万元的工资，就停止浇水了。
    尤其叫人不能容忍的是：该工地负责人对于打筑大楼支柱的态度极为马虎。这座四层楼房仅有四根支柱。在架好钢筋、支立模型板前五天，我们曾要求工地负责同志将钢筋刷净、将柱子底积存的杂物清除后再支立模型板。但在我们进行检查时，从每根柱子的底下还掏出了许多木片、碎砖、白灰碴等杂物，在其中一根柱子里还掏出一个四十六公分长、五公分宽、二点五公分厚的木棍。全部工程只有四根钢筋混凝土柱子，而工地负责同志却如此马虎。这是多么危险的事！
    造成上述情况的原因，主要是该工地领导干部在施工时只追求进度、追求“节约”，而忘却了工程质量。大家知道，在基本建设中，保证工程质量就是最大的节约。特别是今年可利用的工作日只有几十天了，如果工程质量低劣而需要返工，不仅浪费了材料，时间的损失更是无法估计的。希望该工地领导方面纠正不重视工程质量的错误思想，并及时地、认真地检查和改进工作。
