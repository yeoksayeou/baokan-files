    Advanced Producers Report Production Increase and Savings
    Respond to Challenge from Ma Liu-hai and Lian Wan-lu Rapid Tunneling Teams
    Editor's Note: To complete the first annual plan of the national First Five-Year Plan, the Ma Liu-hai and Lian Wan-lu rapid tunneling teams of the Datong Coal Mine have drawn up a production increase and savings competition plan and issued a friendly challenge to tunneling teams (groups) of brother mines across the country (see "Advanced Producers Report Production Increase and Savings" column of this newspaper on October 12). This challenge has now been enthusiastically responded to by many coal mine tunneling teams (groups). The following are letters from the Wang Jin-sheng, Xu Nuo, and Gong Ma-che tunneling teams of the Jiaozuo Mine, and the 12th and 9th groups of the Chengzi Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau, responding to the challenge from the Ma Liu-hai team.

    The challenge issued to the country by the Ma Liu-hai and Lian Wan-lu rapid tunneling teams is of great significance. Tunneling work is the primary process and important preparatory work of coal mine production, and is a prerequisite for ensuring the balanced completion of the national plan; especially today, when the tunneling tasks of most coal mines across the country are not completed well enough, it is even more urgent and important to promote the advanced experience of the Ma Liu-hai and Lian Wan-lu rapid tunneling teams through friendly competition in order to universally improve the tunneling efficiency of various mines. In order to make this competition proceed victoriously in an organized and led manner, the North China Coal Mine Administration Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Department and the Preparatory Committee of the China Coal Mine Trade Union of North China have jointly established a competition inspection office, which will regularly conduct inspections, summaries, and awards for challenge competitions in its affiliated mines. This practice is worth referring to by the leading departments of other mining areas.

    先进生产者报告增产节约情况
    向马六孩、连万禄快速掘进组应战
    编者按：大同煤矿马六孩、连万禄快速掘进组为了完成国家第一个五年建设计划的头一个年度计划，订出了增产节约竞赛计划并向全国各兄弟矿掘进组（队）提出友谊挑战（见十月十二日本报“先进生产者报告增产节约情况”栏）。这一挑战，现在已经得到许多煤矿的掘进组（队）的热烈响应，下面发表的是焦作矿王金生、许诺、龚马车掘进组和京西矿务局城子矿第十二组、第九组等向马六孩组应战的来信。
    马六孩、连万禄快速掘进组向全国提出挑战这件事是有重大意义的。掘进工作是煤矿生产的首要工序和重要的准备工作，是保证均衡地完成国家计划的先决条件；特别是在全国大部分煤矿掘进任务完成得不够好的今天，通过友谊竞赛推广马六孩、连万禄快速掘进组的先进经验，以便普遍地提高各矿掘进效率，这就显得更加迫切重要。为了使得这个竞赛有组织、有领导地胜利进行，中央燃料工业部华北煤矿管理局、中国煤矿工会华北区筹备委员会已经联合成立了竞赛检查办公室，将定期在所属各矿中进行挑战竞赛的检查、总结和评奖工作。这一做法值得其他矿区的领导部门参考。
