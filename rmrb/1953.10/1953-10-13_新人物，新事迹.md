Doing Big Things with Little Money

    Rao Zhenkui is the director of the Nan Shuangdong Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xinglong County, Rehe Province. He used to be a farmer from a poor family. After liberation, he was elected village chief due to his active work; he honorably joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1947; and in December 1950, when the Nan Shuangdong Supply and Marketing Cooperative was established, he was elected director of the cooperative.

    The Nan Shuangdong Supply and Marketing Cooperative was jointly established by the three villages of Nanmugou, Nan Shuangdong, and Changhetao. These three villages have more mountains and less land, and the people's lives are not prosperous. In the beginning, only 580 people from the three villages joined the cooperative, with each share being ten catties of millet, totaling only 5,800 catties of millet, equivalent to 5.8 million yuan. With so little money, it was difficult to start a business. Faced with this difficulty, he did not give in but pondered all day about "how to do big things with little money."

    Initially, he adopted the methods of "frequent purchasing and quick sales" and "quick buying and frequent selling" (referring to local products) to speed up capital turnover. When buying goods, he personally carried them back, and if he happened to meet someone selling firewood with empty pack animals, he would ask them to carry the goods back.

    Later, he came up with a method to have cooperative members submit "order forms" so that purchases could be made according to needs, preventing capital from being tied up. Initially, the members were unwilling to submit them, fearing that the goods would not be to their liking, not timely, or too expensive. Rao Zhenkui explained to the members that they could refuse the goods if they were not to their liking, not timely, or too expensive. However, later it was found that this would lead to unsalable goods, so he would first bring back a sample of what the members wanted to buy, and then order the goods according to the sample after seeking the members' opinions. This reassured the members even more.

    Over the past two years, submitting order forms has become a habit for the cooperative members. They submit their quarterly needs before each quarter. In the first quarter of 1953, the number of households submitting order forms reached 92% of the cooperative members. The supplied goods basically met the needs of the members. This prevented out-of-stock and overstocking of goods, and fully utilized the funds.

Actively Contacting Customers

    Xu Guizhen has been working as a salesperson at the Second Sales Department of the China Department Store Wuhan Company for less than three months. Because she is willing to study and work actively, she has now become a skilled salesperson.

    Every day, she visits more than 20 factories, institutions, and schools to understand what items these units plan to purchase in their next month's budget and when the budget can be approved. When the time comes, she delivers the goods according to their needs. Once, she learned that the Electric Power Civil Engineering Construction Company was a newly established capital construction unit, so she went to contact them. As a result, she sold two calculators, ten bicycles, as well as instruments and mimeograph machines. The unit later proactively contacted Xu Guizhen for goods.

    In addition to actively seeking out sales targets, Xu Guizhen also relies on the shop assistants to find more customers. After work every day, she routinely contacts each counter once to ask what leads they have found and which units' business has not been completed. Then, she records the relevant information and quickly makes contact with the customers. Once, she returned from delivering goods in the afternoon, and a comrade from the counter told her that a customer from the Guangxi Forestry Bureau came to buy goods but left without making a purchase. She thought: Out-of-town customers come and go quickly, so I can't be slow. Coincidentally, it was raining heavily, the sky was dark, and the location was unclear. But she was determined to find them in the rain. As a result, she learned that the customer needed bicycles and stationery instruments but did not know how much the transportation costs would be and was afraid of exceeding the budget. She went to the Railway Administration to find out the freight costs, and then calculated the detailed costs with the purchasing agent and promised to pack the goods for them. This not only sold a large quantity of goods but also ensured that the purchasing unit did not exceed its budget.

Relying on the Masses to Do a Good Job in Taxation

    Fang Jisen is the resident representative of the Liaoyang Municipal Taxation Bureau of Liaodong Province at the Liaoyang Textile Factory. When the leadership sent him to the factory this May, he was afraid that he would not be able to handle the job. After arriving at the textile factory, he often considered how to proactively contact the workers. He started by caring about the workers' lives and welfare. For example, the factory workers did not have time to pay the bicycle license tax because the factory's work hours were the same as the tax bureau's, so he proactively helped the factory compile a list of employees with bicycles in each workshop and paid the tax for them. In addition, the yarn factory warehouse workers often needed soap, so since he was also the resident representative of the cotton wool and soap factory, he proactively ordered soap for the workers. As a result, he was able to get along well with the workers.

    After establishing contact with the masses, Fang Jisen actively studied factory management and went deep into the workshops to understand the production process and learn production technology. Because he was diligent in studying and learning, he quickly understood the important links in controlling production figures in spinning, packaging, and warehousing. By accurately controlling and calculating the workshop records, wage calculations, electricity consumption, and machine performance, and using this as an aid in production control, he also found out the ratio of raw materials to finished products and the moisture content of the self-used yarn. He was able to promptly and accurately grasp the yarn production, so the monthly reports he submitted to the bureau were not only accurate in numbers but also completed ahead of schedule. Because he was good at contacting the masses, the factory was able to provide the tax bureau with tax payment plans and sales plans ahead of schedule or on time, ensuring timely tax payment.

Enthusiastically Selling Unsalable Goods

    Wang Kezhong is a salesperson in the calico and muslin group of the silk and cloth counter of the China Department Store Wuhan Company. In June of this year, he exceeded the entire month's sales target in fourteen days. His friendly attitude towards customers, enthusiastic reception, patient promotion, and efforts to meet customers' requirements are the main reasons for his work achievements. Generally, salespeople dislike customers picking and choosing things, but he is not afraid of the trouble of promoting unsalable goods and substitute products to customers. For example, although Hong Kong Luo goods were not bad, they had been overstocked for two years without being sold, but he kept introducing them to customers and sold them all in a few days. Twenty bolts of white cotton cloth had been overstocked since last year, and only two bolts were sold in the entire year last year, but whenever customers asked about similar clothing materials, he vigorously introduced the quality and price of white cotton cloth and explained the benefits of wearing white cotton cloth in summer. Under his influence, all the comrades in the group actively worked hard to sell a large number of overstocked goods. Olive green serge had been overstocked for more than two years, and he used the same method to sell it all.

    Wang Kezhong's attitude towards customers is amiable and enthusiastic. He always tries his best to let customers choose and does not let a single customer go back empty-handed. In addition to the regular business at the counter, he also automatically changes the window display once a week during his spare time, and the displays are very artistic and beautiful, playing the role of window publicity and greatly helping to develop business.

Delivering Goods to the Countryside, Expanding Turnover

    Zhang Lanfang, a salesperson at the Jiaxin Cooperative in the Fifth District of Jixian County, Songjiang Province, after the superior cooperative called for the method of "delivering goods to the countryside and purchasing grain locally" to expand turnover, she insisted on going to the countryside to deliver goods early and late, expanding turnover by more than 26 million yuan in more than 20 days and purchasing more than 7,000 catties of grain, which played a great role in the cooperative's over-fulfillment of the supply and marketing plan. When the superiors issued the call, she thought: Now the countryside is busy with hoeing, and farmers do not have the time to go to the street to buy daily necessities and means of production, and the cooperative should solve the difficulties of the masses. She continuously carried two to thirty catties of cloth, daily necessities, etc., every day, using the method of going from village to village and entering every household to promote sales. Her relationship with the masses is particularly close. As soon as she enters a village, the children run home to tell their mothers: The girl from the cooperative with two braids is here again! Women are willing to spend their savings to buy their favorite things.

    She insisted on delivering goods to the countryside regardless of day or night, wind or rain. In order to eliminate blind spots, she went to Kangjiatun, more than 20 miles away from the cooperative, to deliver goods. She had to cross many ditches along the way, and the road was difficult to walk. Sometimes it rained heavily, and she took off her cotton coat and covered the goods, preferring to get wet in the rain herself so as not to damage the goods. In addition, she actively tried to find ways to promote unsalable goods, such as processing Shilin cloth into clothes and selling large bottles of MSG in small packages. These overstocked goods were quickly sold out.

    新人物，新事迹
    钱少办大事
    饶振奎是热河省兴隆县南双洞供销合作社主任。他过去是个庄稼人，家里很穷。解放后，他因为工作积极，被选为村长；一九四七年光荣地加入了中国共产党；一九五○年十二月南双洞供销合作社成立时，他被选为合作社主任。
    南双洞供销合作社是南木沟、南双洞、长河套三个村联合成立的。这三个村，山多地少，群众生活不富裕。开始时，三个村只有五百八十个人加入合作社，每股十斤小米，一共才凑了五千八百斤小米，折合五百八十万元。这么点钱，作买卖怎么也打不开捻。在这种困难面前，他没有低头，而是整天盘算着“怎样能钱少办大事”。
    开始他采取了“勤购快销”和“快买勤卖”（指土产）的办法，让资金周转得快。买货时，他亲自往回背、往回挑，凑巧碰到有卖柴的空驮子，就请人家往回捎。
    后来他想了个办法，让社员群众提“订货单”以便用啥办啥，不让资金积压。开始时，社员不肯提，怕货不随心、不及时，怕贵。饶振奎便向社员说明，货不随心、不及时、货贵都可以不要。但是后来一看，这样做会出现冷货，他就把社员要买的东西先拿回一个样子来，在征求社员意见后，再照样子办货。这样一来，社员就更放心了。
    两年来，提订货单成了社员群众的习惯，他们在每个季度以前，就提出一个季度的需要。一九五三年第一季度提订货单的户数，已达到社员户数的百分之九十二。供应的物品，基本上也满足了社员的需要。这样就防止了商品的脱销和积压，充分利用了资金。

    主动联系顾客
    徐贵珍到中国百货公司武汉市公司第二门市部担任推销工作还不满三个月，因为她肯钻研，工作主动，现已锻炼成为一个推销的能手。
    每天她要跑二十多个工厂、机关和学校，了解这些单位下个月预算要采购些什么东西和什么时候预算可以批下来。到时候她就按他们的需要送货去。有一次她了解电业土木建筑工程公司是个刚成立的基本建设单位，她就跑去联系，结果推销了二部计算机、十部脚踏车以及仪器和油印机等，该单位以后要货就主动去找徐贵珍。
    徐贵珍除了自己四出寻找推销对象外，还依靠柜上营业员发现更多的主顾。每天工作结束后，她照例要到各柜联系一次，问柜上发现什么线索，那些单位的生意没做成，然后把有关的情况记下来，迅速和顾客取得联系。有一次她下午送货回来，柜上同志告诉她有个广西森林局的顾客来买货，没有买成就走了。她想：外路客人来得快走得快，去慢了不行。碰巧天下大雨，天色已黑，地名又不清楚。但她决心冒雨去找。结果她知道对方需要脚踏车和文具仪器，但不知运杂费要多少，怕超过预算。她就到铁路管理局问明运费，然后又和这个采购员算细账，并答应代为装箱。这样既推销一大批货，又使采购单位不超过预算。    （徐晓）
    依靠群众办好税收
    房继森是辽东省辽阳市税务局在辽阳纺织厂的驻厂员。当今年五月领导上派他驻厂时，他惟恐不能胜任。他一到纺织厂后，经常考虑如何主动地和职工群众联系。他首先从关心职工生活福利着手。如该厂职工因厂方上下班时间和税局相同，没有时间去交纳自行车牌照税，他就主动地代厂方把各车间有自行车的职工名单列好，代他们去纳税。还有纱厂仓库工人经常需用肥皂，因为他兼任制绵实肥皂工厂的驻厂员，就主动给工人们订购肥皂。因此他能和工人们打成一片。
    在和群众取得联系后，房继森就积极钻研管理工厂，深入车间了解生产过程，学习生产技术知识。由于他虚心钻研、努力学习，很快就了解细纱、包装、仓库的控制生产数字的重要环节。通过对车间记录、计算工资、用电量以及机器的性能进行精确的控制计算，并以此作为生产控制上的辅助，还找出原料与成品的比例及自用纱部分的含水量，作到及时正确的掌握纱产量，因而他每月向局内所报的月报，不但数字正确，并且能提前完成。由于他善于联系群众，使厂方能提前或按时给税局提供纳税计划、推销计划，保证了按时交税。
    热心推销冷货
    王克忠是中国百货公司武汉市公司绸布柜花纱组的营业员。今年六月份，他在十四天内就超额完成全月的销售任务。他对顾客态度和蔼，热情招待，耐心宣传，努力满足顾客的要求，这是他工作获得成绩的主要原因。一般营业员都嫌顾客挑选东西麻烦，他常常不怕麻烦地向顾客推销滞销货及代替商品。如香港罗货虽不坏，但积压已将两年没卖出，而他不断地介绍主顾，几天就卖光了。从去年积压下来的二十疋白洋纱，去年一年内只卖出了两疋，但他只要顾客问到同类的衣料，就大力介绍白洋纱的品质、价格，解释夏天穿白洋纱的好处。在他的影响下，全组同志都积极努力推销了大量积压商品。油绿哔叽是积压了二年多的货，他采取了同样的方法，把它销完了。
    王克忠对顾客的态度是和蔼和热情的，他总是尽量让顾客挑选，不使一个顾客空着手回去。除了柜上的经常业务外，他还利用公余时间，每星期还自动换一次橱窗，而且陈列得非常艺术美观，起到橱窗宣传的作用，对开展业务的帮助很大。

    送货下乡，扩大了营业额
    松江省集贤县第五区嘉信合作社的营业员张兰芳，在上级社号召用“下乡送货、就地购粮”的方法来扩大营业额以后，她起早带黑地坚持下乡送货，二十多天，扩大了营业额二千六百多万元，购回粮食七千多斤，对全社超额完成供销计划起了很大的作用。在上级发出号召时，她就想：现在农村正忙着铲?，农民没有功夫上街买日用品和生产资料，合作社应解决群众困难。她每天不间断地背着二、三十斤重的布匹、日用品等，用屯屯走家家进的办法来推销。她和群众的关系特别密切。她一进村小孩们都跑回家告诉妈妈：合作社那个梳两条辫子的姑娘又来啦！妇女们都愿把积下的钱买心爱的东西。
    她不管黑夜白天、刮风下雨，都坚持下乡送货。为了消灭空白点，她到离合作社二十多里外的康家屯去送货。一路上过很多沟，路不好走。有时天下大雨，她把棉袄脱下盖在货上，情愿自己挨雨淋，不让货物受损失。另外，她积极想办法推销冷货。如以靠士林布加工成衣服，把大瓶味素包成小包卖。这些积压商品很快就销光了。
