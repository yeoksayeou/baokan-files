In the Season of Autumn Harvest

    Many Large-Area High-Yield Fields Appear in Inner Mongolia
    The people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are welcoming the biggest harvest since liberation. Golden millet and bluish-red sorghum cover the fields. In the boundless farmland, one can hear the noise and joyful voices of farmers harvesting crops everywhere. According to the current harvest situation, the yields in various places generally exceed the normal expected output, and many large-area high-yield fields have appeared. In Tongliao County, the average yield of various crops per hectare (one hectare equals fifteen Chinese acres) has reached 3,400 catties. (Lu Gang)
    Ulanhot Also Has Its Own Apples
    Near Ulanhot City, Inner Mongolia, there is an orchard of fifteen hectares, in which many apple trees grow. Twenty percent of these apple trees have already produced fruit this year. This is a great joy for the people of Inner Mongolia. Before liberation, people living in Inner Mongolia had never seen what an apple tree looked like. Today, however, the people of Inner Mongolia not only see verdant apple trees, but also see beautiful apples on the trees that are as red as a child's face, and will personally taste the deliciousness of locally produced apples. This orchard was established by the local People's Government in 1949 and has been four years old this year. Recently, crowds of visitors have been coming to the orchard, including farmers, citizens, and agricultural workers. To meet the needs of visitors, the park has decided to postpone the fruit picking date. (Zhang Sheng Gao)
    Jehol Province Strives to Harvest an Extra Five Catties of Grain per Mu
    A bumper autumn harvest is in sight throughout Jehol Province, and farmers are now happily engaged in intense harvesting work everywhere. According to estimates of the current crop growth, the province's total grain output this year will increase by 6.1 percent compared to last year, the yield per unit area will increase by 1.6 percent compared to last year, and the yield of cotton per unit area will increase by 1.4 percent compared to last year. The more than 140 mu of sorghum and millet planted by the Jianping Du Chang Agricultural Production Cooperative are preliminarily estimated to yield 800 catties of sorghum and 700 catties of millet per mu. This is the second bumper year for Jehol Province since liberation (last year was the first bumper year). This year's crop growth in the province is characterized by good growth in all counties (banners), which is relatively balanced. The Party and government leading organs of the province called on farmers to make every effort to increase grain harvests, striving to harvest an extra five catties per mu, and the whole province an extra 35,000 tons. (Wang Mingde)
    Yunnan's Autumn Planting is Earlier than Last Year
    Farmers in most parts of Yunnan Province are busily carrying out autumn harvesting and planting work. According to statistics from harvested areas, most dryland crops and rice have increased in yield, some by 10 to 20 percent, and the highest by 50 percent. The province's autumn planting is generally earlier than last year. For example, in the second district of Pu'er County, people are plowing and harrowing the fields while threshing rice, and autumn planting is a month earlier than last year. In Simao and other districts, winter buckwheat has basically been planted, and broad beans and peas are being planted. Various places are actively expanding the area planted with minor spring crops in an effort to increase production next spring. In the autumn harvest and planting, various places have strengthened rural commercial work. Fifteen farmers in Yong'an Village, Cheping Township, Chuxiong County, lacked farm implements and seeds during the autumn harvest and planting. After signing a contract with the cooperative to pre-sell 2,300 catties of grain, they immediately took the money to the city to purchase them. They said: As long as the commercial and cooperative departments do a good job in pre-purchase and purchase of agricultural products, and also supply us with seeds and farm implements, we guarantee to do a good job in the autumn harvest and planting work. When the Mojiang County Cooperative pre-purchased goods in Longtan District, it also sent peddlers to the mountainous areas to supply farmers with the production and living materials they needed. The farmers who received the pre-purchase money have successively added autumn harvest and planting implements. Banks in various places have timely issued loans to help farmers solve their difficulties, and the farmers have responded well. (Lin Jianzhong)
    Xiaozhan Rice Increases by More Than 10% Compared to Last Year
    Rice in the Xiaozhan area of ​​the southern suburbs of Tianjin has now entered the yellow ripening period, with fat ears and full grains. It is expected that the average yield per mu can reach more than 700 catties, an increase of 15 to 20 percent compared to last year. The Jiang Deyu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qianying Village planted a total of 416 mu of rice, with an average yield of 800 catties per mu. Among them, eight mu of high-yield land can yield 1,200 catties per mu. Zou Yubin, a famous model of high-yield rice in Huangjiaying Village, can yield more than 1,200 catties per mu on his ten mu of high-yield land.
    At present, farmers in the Xiaozhan area are actively installing threshing machines, tidying up drying yards, and preparing for harvesting. In addition to paying attention to leading farmers to "harvest as soon as it is ripe" to avoid accidental disasters such as wind and frost, the local Party and government organs have also called on farmers to "harvest carefully and thresh carefully" so as not to lose or scatter the grains, reduce losses during the harvesting process, and ensure the victorious completion of this year's rice production increase task.
    State-Owned Farms Play a Demonstrative Role
    The local state-owned farm in Zhangming County, Sichuan, has achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest of rice this year and has driven the mutual aid groups near the farm, playing a demonstrative role. This year, due to the implementation of advanced farming methods such as "good seeds and strong seedlings, less seedlings and dense planting, and rational fertilization," and the implementation of pest control, the average yield per mu of high-yield fields in the farm increased by more than 23 percent. Under the leadership of the farm, mutual aid groups such as Zhang Yongcheng, Hu Zhengwen, and Tu Shijia, as well as farmers in nearby villages such as Longquan Village, Puzhao Village, and Shuangniu Village, also absorbed advanced experience and increased the yield per unit area. The reason why the farm can achieve such results is because the Party committee attaches importance to the leadership of the farm and promotes advanced farming methods. Wu Yunxian, a worker at the farm, said: Working on the farm is like studying in an agricultural school, and there is progress in all aspects. (Fan Xiangru, Yang Xisheng, Yang Changbin)
    Organize to Grow More Grain
    Farmers in Baoding Prefecture, Hebei, are actively harvesting the mature autumn crops. The harvest in Baoding Prefecture this year is generally good, averaging 75% of a good year. According to surveys, the yields of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in various places generally exceed those of individual farmers. Among the 48 mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives in Mancheng, Laishui and other counties, 45 of them exceeded the yield of individual farmers, generally exceeding by 20 to 30 percent. The millet of the Yao Zhensheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Mancheng yielded an average of 27 percent more per mu than the local masses. Some farmers said: Individual work cannot compare with being organized; a grain harvest immediately reveals the difference. (Liang Zhongjiang)
    Hand Over Public Grain Well to Celebrate National Day
    The mutual aid group led by Chen Yongkai, a labor model in Shuikou Village, Jiangjin County, Sichuan, has improved its farming techniques this year, and the harvest of the whole group's crops has increased by 47 percent compared with last year. All members of the group are determined to celebrate National Day by handing over public grain well and continuing to do a good job in production. He Ronghui, the father of group member He Lushu, aired the full and large grains of rice until they were thoroughly dry, separated them from other grains, and prepared to hand them over to the state. Many group members who borrowed money from the state bank expressed their intention to sell the grain to the state and repay their loans in a timely manner. Now, the entire group has completed the plowing of all the winter water paddies three days ahead of schedule, and is actively plowing the dry land for planting wheat. The group has set out a wheat production increase plan, and the members have expressed their determination to do a good job in plowing and planting wheat. (Cheng Yihua, He Dashuang)
    "Harvest What You Grow"
    In the autumn harvest, the Guo Wenhua Mutual Aid Group in Wangtao Village, Qinyuan County, Shanxi, implemented the method of "harvesting one plot when it ripens, plowing one plot when one is harvested, and threshing it when it is dry," changed the habit of procrastination, and avoided wasting grain. Hao Yanxin of the group said when discussing the autumn harvest work that the autumn harvest in 1952 started in August and dragged on until the end of the year to be considered over. Xiao You wheat ripened early, and was harvested early, but it was not threshed early. As a result, it was covered by a snow and one stone and several dou were lost. The grains that were harvested did not smell good when ground into flour. Such preventable disasters can be overcome. This year, we must harvest and thresh at the same time. After discussion, the whole group made an autumn harvest plan and launched a competition challenge to the Duan Buyun, Hao Guiyao and other mutual aid groups in the village. Now, under their leadership, the masses in the entire village have reversed the habit of procrastination and are determined to ensure that they "harvest what they grow."

    在秋收的季节里
    内蒙出现很多大面积丰产田
    内蒙古自治区人民正迎接解放以来的最大丰收。金黄色的谷子和青红色的高粱覆盖了田野，在无边的庄稼地里，到处都可以听到农民们收割庄稼时所发出的喧嚷和欢乐声。根据目前收割情况看来，各地普遍超过了常年应产量，出现了很多大面积的丰产田。通辽县各种作物每垧（一垧合十五市亩）平均产量都达到三千四百斤。（鲁岗）
  乌兰浩特也有自己的苹果了
    内蒙古乌兰浩特市近郊，有一个十五垧地的果树园，园里长了许多苹果树。这些苹果树中，有百分之二十的树今年已经结果了。这对内蒙人民来说，是一件大喜事。生长在内蒙的人们，解放前从来没有看到过苹果树是什么样子，可是，今天内蒙人民不但看到了青油油的苹果树，也看到了苹果树上结着的红得像小孩脸蛋一样美丽的苹果，而且将亲口尝到当地出产的苹果的美味。这个果树园是当地人民政府在一九四九年建立的，到今年已是四年了。近来，到果园参观的人群络绎不绝，其中有农民、有市民，还有农业工作者。为了满足参观者的要求，该园特决定延迟摘果日期。（张圣高）
  热河省争取每亩多收五斤粮
    热河全省秋庄稼丰收在望，现在各地农民正在欢快地进行紧张的收割工作。根据目前庄稼生长情况估计，今年全省粮食的总产量将比去年增加百分之六点一，单位面积产量将比去年增加百分之一点六，棉花单位面积产量将比去年增加百分之一点四。建平杜昌农业生产合作社种的一百四十多亩高粱和谷子，初步估计，高粱每亩可产八百斤，谷子每亩可产七百斤。这是热河省解放以来的第二个丰收年（去年是第一个丰收年）。今年全省庄稼生长的特点是：各县（旗）长得都好，较为平衡。该省党、政领导机关，号召农民尽力提高粮食收获量，争取每亩地多收五斤，全省多收三万五千吨。（王明德）
  云南秋种比去年提早了
    云南省大部地区的农民正在紧张地进行秋收秋种工作。据已收割地区的统计，旱地作物和水稻大部分都增产，有的增产一成至二成，最高的增产到五成。该省秋种工作一般比去年早。如普洱县二区边打谷子边犁田、耙田，秋种比去年提早一个月。思茅等区冬荞麦已经基本种完，正在栽种蚕豆和豌豆。各地正积极扩大栽种小春作物的面积，争取明春增产。在秋收秋种中，各地都加强了农村商业工作。楚雄县车坪乡永安村十五户农民，在秋收秋种中缺乏农具籽种，经与合作社订立合同预售二千三百斤谷子以后，立即拿钱进城去添购。他们说：只要商业、合作社等部门搞好了预购和收购农产品的工作，又供应给我们籽种、农具，我们保证搞好秋收秋种工作。墨江县合作社在龙潭区预购时，还派出货郎担到山区，供应农民所需生产及生活资料。拿到预购款的农民都纷纷添置秋收秋种农具。各地银行都及时发放贷款，帮助农民解决困难，农民的反映良好。（林建中）
    小站水稻比去年增产一成多
    天津市南郊小站一带水稻现已进入黄熟时期，穗子肥大，子粒饱满，预计每亩平均可收七百斤以上，比去年增产一成半到二成。前营村姜德玉农业生产合作社共种水稻四百一十六亩，平均每亩可收八百斤，其中八亩丰产地，每亩可收一千二百斤。黄家营村著名水稻丰产模范邹玉彬的十亩丰产田，每亩可收一千二百斤以上。
    目前小站一带农民正积极安装脱粒机具，整理晒场，准备收割。当地党政机关除注意领导农民
  “随熟随割”，避免遭受风霜等意外灾害外，并号召农民“细收细打”，不使谷粒丢落、抛散，减少收获过程中的损失，以保证今年水稻增产任务的胜利完成。
  国营农场起了示范作用
    四川彰明县地方国营农场，今年水稻获得全面丰收，并带动了农场附近的互助组，起了示范作用。该场今年由于实行了“好种壮秧，少秧密植，合理施肥”的先进耕作法，并进行了除虫工作，使得该场丰产田每亩平均增产百分之二十三以上。在农场带动下，张永成、胡正文、凃士家等互助组，及附近龙泉村、普照村、双牛村等村农民也都吸收先进经验，提高了单位面积产量。该场所以能有这样的成绩，是因为党委重视对该场的领导并推行了先进耕作法。该场工人吴运先说：在农场工作和在农业学校读书一样，各方面都有长进。
                  （范相如、杨希圣、杨昌斌）
    组织起来多打粮
    河北保定专区的农民积极收割已经成熟的秋庄稼。保定专区今年收成一般良好，平均可达七成半年景。根据调查，各地农业生产合作社和互助组的产量一般都超过单干农民。满城、涞水等县四十八个互助组和农业生产合作社中，超过单干农民产量的就有四十五个，一般是超过百分之二十到三十。满城要振生农业生产合作社的谷子，每亩平均比当地群众多收百分之二十七。有的农民说：单干就是比不上组织起来，一打粮食就显出两样来了。
                                    （梁中江）
  缴好公粮庆祝国庆
    四川江津县水口村劳动模范陈永开所领导的互助组，今年改进了耕作技术，全组庄稼的收成比去年增产四成七。全组组员决心以缴好公粮，继续搞好生产来庆祝国庆节。组员何鲁树的父亲何荣辉把饱满的大颗的谷子风的干干净净，和其他谷子分开来放，准备拿去缴纳给国家。许多在国家银行借款的组员，都表示要把粮食卖给国家，及时还清借款。现在，全组已提前三天把关冬水的板田全部犁完，并积极犁种麦子的干田。该组订出了小麦增产计划，组员们表示决心，要做好犁田种麦的工作。
                        （程宜华、何大双）
  “几成庄稼几成收”
    山西沁源县王陶村郭文华互助组秋收中实行了“黄一块割一块，割一块犁一块，干了就打”的办法，改变了拖拉习惯，避免了糟损粮食。该组郝彦信在讨论秋收工作时就说，一九五二年秋收在八月就开始了，拖拉到年底才算结束，二八秋小莜麦熟的早，割的早，就是没有早打，结果被一场雪盖上，少收了一石几斗，而收了的粒子磨成面，气味也不好。像这种可以预防的灾害，是能够战胜的，今年一定要边收边打。讨论后，全组订出了秋收计划，并向村里段步云、郝桂尧等互助组展开竞赛挑战。现在全村群众在他们带动下，扭转了拖拉习惯，保证要做到“几成庄稼几成收”。
