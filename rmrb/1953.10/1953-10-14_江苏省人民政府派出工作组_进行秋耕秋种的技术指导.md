The Jiangsu Provincial People's Government has dispatched six work teams to areas including Xuzhou, Huaiyin, Nantong, Songjiang, and Zhenjiang to provide agricultural technical guidance for autumn plowing and planting. These work teams consist of more than eighty agricultural technicians. In areas north of the Yangtze River, the main focus is on guiding wheat planting techniques. Agricultural technical work team members are going deep into the countryside to guide farmers in selecting seeds and planting at appropriate densities. In the late rice areas south of the Yangtze River, the work teams are primarily guiding farmers in rapid harvesting and threshing techniques, and guiding farmers to plow and sow simultaneously, ensuring timely planting of wheat and green manure crops. In cotton-growing areas, the main focus is on guiding cotton farmers to reduce frost-damaged cotton bolls and hasten cotton maturity, and teaching cotton farmers how to plant wheat.
