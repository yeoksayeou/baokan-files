    To address the difficulties faced by disaster-stricken farmers in repaying loans and to encourage their enthusiasm for self-salvation through production, the Head Office of the People's Bank of China, in accordance with the spirit of the "Instructions on Strengthening Grain Production and Disaster Relief Work" and the "Instructions on Issuing Agricultural Loans" issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government, has formulated measures for handling the reduction, exemption, or postponement of agricultural loans due in disaster areas in 1953. These measures have been reviewed and approved by the State Council and have been notified to banks at all levels and relevant departments for implementation. The main content of these measures is as follows:
    I. For agricultural loan households in disaster areas who owe the state bank agricultural loans due in 1953, if one of the following conditions is met, a portion or all of the principal and interest may be waived and transferred to government relief: (1) Areas that have suffered severe natural disasters such as floods and droughts for consecutive years, and the loan households are genuinely unable to repay overdue loans accumulated over many years; (2) Poor peasants or impoverished middle peasants who are genuinely unable to repay overdue loans due to a total harvest of summer and autumn crops this year being less than 30% due to severe natural disasters.
    II. For loan households who have suffered natural disasters with a total summer harvest of between 30% and 60%, and who have genuine difficulties in repaying overdue loans, the repayment may be postponed for one year. For impoverished peasants with more difficulties, the repayment may be extended to two years, and the loan interest and a portion of the principal may be waived as appropriate.
    III. Individual poor loan households in mountainous areas, old revolutionary base areas, and other barren areas, even if they have not suffered disasters, but whose overdue loans accumulated over many years are genuinely unrecoverable, should also be given appropriate postponements, or even exemptions from interest and part or all of the principal of their overdue loans, depending on the circumstances.
    IV. Loans granted to farmers by banks through credit cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and other departments, if they meet the conditions for reduction or postponement in Articles I, II, and III, shall be handled in accordance with the preceding provisions. Those that do not meet the preceding provisions shall still repay the overdue loans in accordance with the original loan agreement.
    V. Loan households that do not meet the conditions for reduction and exemption, as well as loans to grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in disaster areas, loans to industrial and commercial enterprises in market towns, and loans to handicraft workers and vendors in rural areas who are mainly engaged in handicrafts or commerce, shall repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreement. For those who have difficulty in repayment, the repayment period may be extended as appropriate.
    The measures also stipulate that the work of reducing, exempting, or postponing agricultural loans due in disaster areas should be carried out under the unified leadership of the local Party committees and governments, in conjunction with production relief organizations at all levels, conduct thorough investigations, explain the policies of reduction and exemption, and carry out reduction and postponement on a household-by-household basis. The principle to be followed in implementation is to postpone repayments for minor disasters, partially reduce or postpone repayments for severe disasters, and fully exempt repayments for particularly severe disasters. Provincial branches may, based on the spirit of these measures and in conjunction with the actual local conditions, add supplementary measures, which shall be reviewed and approved by the provincial people's government and implemented together during the loan collection work after the autumn harvest. In order to carry out this work in a planned manner, the measures also stipulate that each province should propose a controlled figure for the loans to be reduced or exempted, and submit it to the Central Financial and Economic Commission for approval before implementation.

    照顾灾区农民归还贷款的困难
    中国人民银行发布灾区农贷减免缓收办法
    为照顾灾区农民归还贷款的困难，鼓励农民生产自救热情，中国人民银行总行特根据中央人民政府政务院“关于加强增产粮食和救灾工作的指示”和“关于发放农业贷款的指示”的精神，制订了一九五三年灾区到期农贷减免缓收处理办法，这一办法业经政务院审核同意，并通知各级银行及有关部门遵照执行。该项办法的主要内容是：
    一、凡灾区农业贷款户所欠国家银行一九五三年到期农业贷款，具有下列情形之一者，得酌情免收本息一部分或全部，转作政府救济：（一）凡连年遭受水旱等严重的自然灾害的地区，贷款户多年累欠的到期贷款确实无力偿还者；（二）凡因遭受严重自然灾害，今年夏秋两季作物总收成在三成以下的贫农或贫苦中农确实无力偿还到期贷款者。
    二、凡因遭受自然灾害今年夏季总收成在六成以下、三成以上的贷户，偿还到期贷款确有困难者，可延期一年归还，对困难较多的贫苦农民，可延长至二年归还，并可酌情免除贷款利息及一部分本金。
    三、山区、老根据地区及其他贫瘠地区的个别贫苦贷户虽未遭灾，但其多年所欠到期贷款确属无法偿还者，亦应分别情况，酌予缓收，以至免收其到期贷款利息及本金之一部分或全部。
    四、凡银行委托信用社、供销社及其他部门贷给农民的贷款，如合乎第一、二、三条减免或缓收条件者，均得依照前项规定办理，不合乎前项规定者仍须照原订贷约归还到期贷款。
    五、凡不合前项减免条件之贷户，以及灾区基层供销社贷款、集镇工商业贷款和农村中以经营手工业或商业为主的手工业者与商贩等贷款均得按贷约规定偿还贷款，对其中归还有困难者可酌予延长还款期限。
    该办法并规定，灾区到期农贷减免缓收工作，应在当地党委、政府统一领导下，结合各级生产救济组织，深入调查，讲明减免政策，以户为单位进行减免缓收。在掌握上应以轻灾缓收、重灾部分减免、部分缓收，特重全免为原则，各省行可根据此办法的精神结合当地实际情况，增订补充办法，经省人民政府审查批准后，在秋后收贷工作时一并进行。为了使这项工作有计划地进行，该办法还规定各省需减免的贷款由各省提出控制数字，报中央财政经济委员会批准后执行。
