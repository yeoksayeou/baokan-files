In the movement to increase production and practice economy, machinery industry enterprises should achieve two goals: First, on the existing foundation, further improve the management and technical levels of the enterprises, creating conditions for further production growth next year. Second, comprehensively overfulfill the state plan and increase profit contributions to the state, accumulating more construction funds for the country. Both of these goals must be achieved simultaneously to be considered a comprehensive completion of the task of increasing production and practicing economy. To achieve these two goals, all employees of each enterprise, especially leaders at all levels, must firmly grasp two basic principles: First, resolutely implement the operation plan, using the operation plan as a means to achieve the goals of increasing production and practicing economy. Second, increasing production must increase revenue, achieving timely or early completion of the financial contribution task, according to plan and striving to exceed the target.

Why must these two principles be grasped, and how should they be grasped?

First, although the machinery industry has experienced tremendous growth every year since the founding of New China, the potential production capacity is still very large and has not been well utilized. This is reflected in: insufficient work planning, very uneven production, and the common phenomenon of alternating periods of slack and intensity. Labor organization in many enterprises is still unsound or extremely unreasonable, resulting in low labor productivity. Technical management is weak, many major technical problems remain to be solved, and product quality cannot be maintained or reach the required level. The cost of many products is still very high, and capital turnover is slow. All of this constitutes a very chaotic state of enterprise management, and the exertion of production capacity is greatly limited. The so-called "seven waits" are common in factories: waiting for tasks, waiting for drawings, waiting for materials, waiting for tools, waiting for equipment, waiting for manpower, and waiting for power. Therefore, the equipment utilization rate is very low, labor efficiency is not high, costs are high, there are many defective products, and the quality is not good. According to statistics from forty-four factories in July of this year, based on two shifts, the average equipment utilization rate was only 61.7%; according to statistics from ninety-two factories in the first half of the year, workers' downtime and absenteeism totaled more than 1.3 million workdays, equivalent to 8,800 people not producing for half a year. This is the serious problem currently existing in the machinery industry's production. Gradually overcoming this chaotic state and further enhancing production efficiency will undoubtedly be the greatest increase in production and economy.

Since the summer of this year, after enterprises have focused on strengthening planning management and implementing operation plans, the state of production management has improved significantly. Many enterprises have adjusted workshop labor organization with products as the object, and implemented joint work sections and joint groups; planning and scheduling work systems have been and are being established; the phenomenon of disconnection between production and reality is gradually being overcome; the flow of work-in-progress has also begun to be grasped, and many workshops have generally achieved a clear understanding of the situation; statistical and record systems, work service systems, equipment maintenance and technical safety systems, product inspection, material and tool supply, and other aspects of work that meet the requirements of the operation plan have been improved to varying degrees, and the production efficiency of many enterprises has been improved. These achievements show that production is increasing and waste is decreasing through the implementation of the operation plan. Therefore, overcoming various difficulties and consistently implementing the operation plan is fully in line with the needs of the machinery industry to improve management and is also fully in line with the requirements of increasing production and practicing economy.

If the improvement of enterprise management is not combined with increasing production and practicing economy, but instead, the operation plan is abandoned and a rush method is used to increase production and practice economy, although some production increase effects may be achieved, it will inevitably damage the existing planning management foundations and the normal order of production, disrupt labor organization and systems, and exhaust all reserve forces without a plan. This is obviously very harmful to the future development of production. After consuming the reasonable reserves of work-in-progress and parts to rush out finished products, it will be difficult to continue production, resulting in a month of rushing and two or three months of nothing to do. It can be seen that any other approach that departs from strengthening planning management, especially the rush method, will be a serious injury to the development of the machinery industry and must be resolutely prevented.

The situation since the start of the movement to increase production and practice economy has proven that enterprises that have grasped the above principles have shown achievements. For example, Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory, after formulating the targets for increasing production and practicing economy, first summarized the implementation of the operation plan in the past. After discovering that the lack of advancement of the operation plan and the excessive work-in-progress were the main problems hindering production, the key points of the plan for increasing production and practicing economy were set as: compressing work-in-progress, increasing production, improving labor organization in the assembly workshop, and implementing parallel production lines. As a result of the implementation, the assembly cycle has been shortened from seventeen days to fifteen days, and each day shortened can increase the production of five machines.

However, there are also some enterprises that have not clearly resolved this problem. They ask: "Should we focus on increasing production and practicing economy, or should we focus on planning management?" This kind of opposition between the two is incorrect and should be quickly corrected.

Secondly, the production of the machinery industry is not yet closely linked to the supply of raw materials, especially the needs of products. Although some products are needed, the supply of raw materials is insufficient; some products lack sales channels, resulting in a considerable amount of backlog. Therefore, increasing production must be carried out in a planned manner. If production is increased indiscriminately, a large amount of work-in-progress may be accumulated due to the lack of certain materials and the inability to assemble complete products. Other products, although production is increased, the more production increases, the larger the backlog becomes. Not only can the profits from the increased production not be turned over, but also the profits that have already been realized will be used to subsidize them, which runs counter to the principle of increasing production and increasing revenue. To prevent this phenomenon, it is necessary to clearly recognize the principle of increasing production must increase revenue, and use this principle as a sign to assess whether the task of increasing production and practicing economy has been completed. The practice of only paying attention to increasing the total value of production and the total value of goods, while ignoring whether profits can be realized and financial tasks can be turned over on time, violates the spirit and purpose of increasing production and practicing economy.

Therefore, based on the combination of supply, production, and sales, existing products should be classified and their direction of increasing production and practicing economy should be specified differently. According to the current situation of the machinery industry, products can be roughly divided into four categories: One type is products that can be increased in production as much as possible. These products should have sales channels, materials, roughly reasonable costs, and can realize profits after production is increased. One type is products that are increased in production in a controlled manner, that is, sales channels are limited or material supply is limited. The production increase plan should be specified within a certain quantity to avoid excessive production and causing backlog. One type is products that maintain the original plan without increasing production. These products have poor sales channels or have a small amount of backlog, but materials have already been invested, so the original production plan can be maintained, or, such as certain new products, although there is a need, the selling price is far lower than the cost due to the lack of mastery of operating techniques and the large management costs, so it is not appropriate to increase production. Another type is products that should be reduced in production, such as old-fashioned and unsalable products that have been stockpiled in large quantities, should be properly organized to reduce production and convert to other products.

At present, plans for increasing production and practicing economy have been issued to enterprises. According to the situation already reflected in various regions, in order to ensure the smooth realization of the tasks of increasing production and practicing economy and to prevent possible deviations, the leading comrades at all levels of the machinery industry should pay attention to the following issues in their work:

First: Mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses is the key to whether the plan for increasing production and practicing economy can be combined with the actual situation of the factory and whether it can be implemented. This is completely consistent with implementing and promoting the operation plan. That is to say, the task of promoting the operation plan to achieve the task of increasing production and practicing economy cannot be simply handed over to certain functional departments, but must be personally led by the factory director and mobilize all employees to complete it. We should unify our understanding and unify our thinking, and under the correct direction, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. As long as the masses can be fully mobilized and organized to discuss plans and make specific measures, any enterprise has broad prospects for increasing production and practicing economy. According to the existing materials, employees of various factories have proposed more than a dozen methods, such as: reducing the scrap rate, reducing the tool consumption rate, reducing downtime and machine time, increasing attendance rate, reducing accidents, safe production, saving workshop expenses and various management fees, shortening the turnover period of working capital, shortening the production cycle, reducing unnecessary reserves, changing the material input method, strengthening the repair of defective products, cleaning up backlog products, cleaning up dead materials, and using waste materials to produce by-products. These methods are worth referring to by various enterprises.

Second: Based on summarizing the implementation of the operation plan in the past, formulate practical measures and plans. If only the targets for increasing production and practicing economy of various workshops and departments are stipulated from top to bottom, and stay at the discussion of the level of the targets, the movement cannot be led to the correct track. We should check the shortcomings of the past, find out the weak links in production activities, incorporate them into the operation plan, and gradually solve them, so as to achieve the purpose of strengthening planning management and increasing production and practicing economy. For example: factories where equipment frequently has accidents should strengthen the maintenance and repair of equipment to reduce downtime; factories where quality is seriously unstable should focus on improving quality; factories where tools and fixtures cannot be supplied in time and cause excessive downtime should formulate specific measures to strengthen the tool workshop. In short, specific improvement measures should be made for the weakest link in the factory, so that the improvement of enterprise management and increasing production and practicing economy can be closely combined.

Third: We must oppose the view of overemphasizing specialization, actively develop product sales channels, and actively undertake miscellaneous tasks. This is the key to further combining the production and needs of the machinery industry and achieving increased production. At present, overemphasizing the specialization of production is unrealistic. The state needs to provide a wide variety of products, and the machinery industry has the responsibility to produce and supply them. We cannot simply take the ease and difficulty of production management as the main starting point. Enterprises should have main products and should also undertake miscellaneous tasks, so that they are miscellaneous but not chaotic. To this end, it is necessary to strengthen sales work at all levels, strengthen publicity, and actively find out what departments need and research what they need. We should not take a rejecting attitude towards miscellaneous tasks. Correspondingly, the material supply work should also be strengthened, opening up sources of materials, vigorously handling backlogs, and enterprises should adjust each other's needs to ensure the needs of increased production and accelerate the turnover of working capital.

Fourth: Pay attention to preparing for production in the first quarter of next year. In this year's increase in production and economy, we should also create conditions for production growth next year. We cannot increase production this year and reduce production next year. Therefore, we should formulate specific plans in terms of determining tasks, preparing drawings, materials, tools, and balancing equipment and manpower. In production, we should pay attention to maintaining the necessary reserves, and the method of increasing production by eating reserves should be prevented. We should seize the trial production of new products and ensure the completion of the plan, which is the most important preparation for future production.

Fifth: Some units have begun to produce the phenomenon of increased output and decreased quality, or only pay attention to increasing production and not paying attention to saving, or would rather produce some of the original unsalable products than undertake the miscellaneous tasks urgently needed by the country, or relax the trial production of new products, or rely on rushing and relying on increasing labor intensity to implement increased production, etc. These practices are incorrect and should be corrected in time.

The work of increasing production and practicing economy is to be carried out on the basis of strengthening planning management and promoting the operation plan, so it is a comprehensive work. Therefore, the leading comrades of enterprises must master the balancing method in planning work, take care of all aspects of work, make them connected to each other, cooperate with each other, and promote various work forward around the center. We should regard the balancing method as one of the basic methods to strengthen planning and improve work efficiency.

In the movement to increase production and practice economy, we must mobilize the masses and rely on the masses, so the timely promotion and exchange of various advanced experiences should become an extremely important work within and between enterprises, and leaders at all levels must pay full attention to it.

In the movement to increase production and practice economy, enterprises should take all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure the safe production of employees, take proper care of their welfare, and have appropriate reward methods to give employees due encouragement.

The movement to increase production and practice economy in the machinery industry has been gradually deepening. We firmly believe that under the guidance of the correct direction and with the efforts of the broad masses of employees, the task can be successfully completed.

    机械工业增产节约中的两条原则
    机械工业各企业通过增产节约运动，应当实现两个目的：第一，在现有基础上，把企业的管理水平和技术水平再加提高，为明年生产的进一步增长创造条件。第二，全面超额完成国家计划，增加上缴利润，为国家积累更多的建设资金。这两个目的必须同时实现，才能算作全面地完成增产节约任务。为了实现这两个目的，各个企业的全体职工，首先是各级领导同志，必须紧紧地掌握住两条基本原则：第一，坚决推行作业计划，以作业计划为手段，达到增产节约的目的。第二，增加生产必须增加收入，做到按期或提前、按计划并且力争超额完成上缴财政任务。
    为什么必须掌握和怎样掌握这两条原则呢？
    首先，机械工业虽然在新中国成立后，历年都有巨大的增长，但潜在的生产能力仍然很大，没有很好的发挥。表现在：工作的计划性不足，生产还很不均衡，时松时紧的现象普遍存在。劳动组织在很多企业中还不健全，或者还极不合理，因而劳动生产率还不高。技术管理薄弱，许多重大的技术问题尚待解决，产品质量还不能保持或达到应有的水平。许多产品的成本还很高，资金周转迟缓。这一切构成了企业的管理情况还很混乱，生产能力的发挥受到了极大的限制。工厂中普遍存在所谓“七待”：待任务、待图纸、待材料、待工具、待设备、待人力和待动力。因此，设备利用率很低，劳动效率不高，成本高，废品多，质量不好。据四十四个工厂今年七月份的统计，按两班计算，设备利用率平均只达百分之六十一点七；据九十二个工厂上半年的统计，工人停工和缺勤共达一百三十多万工作日，相当八千八百多人半年没有生产。这就是机械工业生产上当前存在的严重问题，把这种混乱状态逐渐加以克服，使生产效率得到进一步的发挥，无疑将是最大的增产节约。
    今年夏季，各企业以加强计划管理、推行作业计划为中心工作后，生产管理的状况，已有很大改善。许多企业都以产品为对象，调整了车间劳动组织，实行了联合工段和联合小组；计划与调度工作制度，已经和正在建立；生产和实际脱节的现象正在逐渐克服；在制品的流动情况，也开始能够掌握，不少车间已大体做到了心中有数；适应作业计划要求的统计、记录制度，工作服务制度，设备检修与技术安全制度，以及产品检验，材料和工卡具的供应等等各方面的工作都有了不同程度的改进，许多企业的生产效率，都已提高了。这些成就说明，通过作业计划的推行，生产正在增加，浪费正在减少。因此，克服各种困难，把作业计划坚持贯彻下去，是完全符合机械工业改进管理上的需要的，同时也是完全符合增产节约的要求的。
    如果不是把改进企业管理和增产节约结合起来，而是撇开作业计划，用突击的方法，去搞增产节约，虽也可以收到某些增产的效果，但势必使企业已有的计划管理基碍和生产的正常秩序遭受破坏，劳动组织和制度被打乱，一切后备力量将被无计划的消耗，这对生产的发展前途来说，显然是十分有害的。为了突击出成品而消耗在制品和部件的合理储备量以后，再继续生产就困难了，结果会形成一个月突击，两三个月没事干。由此可见，离开加强计划管理的其他做法，特别是突击的方式，对于机械工业的发展来说，将是一种严重的损伤，必须坚决防止。
    增产节约运动开始以来的情况业已证明，凡是掌握了上述原则的企业，都已显示出成绩。例如沈阳第三机床厂，在制订增产节约指标以后，首先总结了过去作业计划执行的情况，发现作业计划的先进性不足和在制品过多，是障碍生产的主要问题后，就把增产节约措施计划的要点订为：压缩在制品，提高生产量，改善装配车间的劳动组织，实行平行作业线。执行的结果，装配周期已由十七天缩短为十五天，每缩短一天即可增产五台机器。
    但也有若干企业，还没有明确解决这个问题，他们提出：“究竟应当以增产节约为中心呢？还是应当以计划管理为中心？”这种把两者对立起来的提法是不对的，应当迅速纠正。
    其次，机械工业的生产，尚未和原材料的供应特别是产品的需要密切结合起来。有些产品虽然需要，但原材料供应不足；有些产品则缺乏销路，以致有相当数量的积压。因此，增加生产必须有计划地进行，如果不加区别地实行增产，就可能因某种材料缺乏，不能装配完整的产品而积压大量的在制品，另一些产品尽管增产出来了，但增产越多积压越大，不但增产的利润不能上缴，还会把已经实现的利润，都贴补进去，这就和增加生产增加收入的原则，背道而驰了。为了防止这种现象，故应明确认识增加生产必须增加收入的原则，以这个原则作为考核增产节约任务是否完成的标志。那种只注意增加生产总值和商品总值，忽视能否实现利润和按期上缴财政任务的做法，是违背增产节约的精神和目的的。
    为此，就应当根据供、产、销结合的情况，把现有产品加以分类，有区别地规定其增产节约的方向，按照机械工业当前的情况，大体上可以分为四类产品：一种是可以尽量增加生产的产品，这类产品应是有销路、有材料，成本大致合理，增产后可以实现利润。一种是有控制的增加生产的产品，即销路有限或材料供应有限，增产计划即应规定在一定数量之内，避免增产过多，造成积压。一种是维持原计划，不增加生产的产品，这类产品销路不畅，或已有少量积压，但业已投入材料，可以维持原订生产计划，或如某些新产品，虽有需要，但因操作技术尚未熟练掌握，管理费用很大，因而售价远低于成本，也不宜增加生产。再一种是应当减产的产品，如式样老旧和无法销售，已经大批积压的，就应妥善组织减产及改为其他产品。
    目前，增产节约计划，都已下达到企业，根据各地区已经反映的情况，为了保证增产节约任务的顺利实现，防止可能发生的偏向，机械工业的各级领导同志在工作中应当注意下列问题：
    第一：动员群众，依靠群众，是增产节约计划能否结合工厂的实际情况和能否贯彻执行的关键。这和贯彻推行作业计划，是完全一致的。这就是说，不能把推行作业计划以实现增产节约的任务，仅仅交给某些职能部门去办，必须是厂长亲自领导，动员全体职工来完成。应当统一认识、统一思想，在正确的方向之下，发挥群众的积极性和创造性，只要能充分发动群众，组织他们讨论计划和作出具体措施，任何一个企业在增产节约上，都有其广阔的前途。根据已有的材料，各厂职工已经提出了十几项办法，例如：降低废品率，降低工具消耗率，减少停工工时和台时，提高出勤率，减少事故，安全生产，节约车间费用及各项管理费，缩短流动资金的周转期，缩短生产周期，减少不必要的储备量，改变投料方法，加强废品返修，清理积压产品，清理呆料，利用废料生产副产品等等。这些办法是值得各企业相互参考的。
    第二：要在总结过去推行作业计划的基础上，制订切合实际的措施计划。如果仅仅是自上而下规定了各车间各部门的增产节约指标，及停留在对于指标高低的讨论上，是不能把运动引向正确的轨道上去的。应当检查过去的缺点，找出生产活动中的薄弱环节，编入作业计划，逐步解决，就可以实现加强计划管理与增产节约的目的。例如：在设备上经常发生事故的工厂，就应加强设备的维护与检修工作，以减少中断台时；质量严重不稳定的工厂，应着重提高质量；工卡具不能及时供应，造成中断工时过多的工厂，应订出具体措施加强工具车间。总之，要针对本厂的最薄弱的环节，作出具体改进措施，这样就可以把改进企业管理和增产节约密切结合起来。
    第三：要反对过分强调专业化的观点，积极开辟产品销路，主动承揽杂活。这是使机械工业的生产和需要进一步结合和达到增加生产的关键。目前，过分强调生产的专业化，是不切合实际的。国家需要提供多种多样的产品，机械工业有责任来生产和供应，不能单纯以生产管理上的易和难为主要出发点，企业应当有主要的产品，也应当承担杂活，要做到杂而不乱。为此就必须加强各级销售工作，加强宣传，主动找需要部门研究他们需要那些东西，对于杂活不应采取拒绝的态度。与此相适应的材料供应工作也应加强，开辟材料来源，大力处理积压，企业之间互相调济有无，以保证增产的需要，并可加速流动资金的周转。
    第四：要注意为明年第一季度生产做好准备工作。在今年增产节约中，应同时给明年的生产增长创造条件，不能是今年增产、明年减产。因此，就应当在确定任务，准备图纸、材料、工具及平衡设备和人力等方面，制订具体的计划，在生产中应注意保持必要的储备量，靠吃储备量而增产的办法是应加防止的。应抓紧新产品的试制工作，保证完成计划，这是对今后生产最重要的准备。
    第五：有些单位开始发生产量提高质量降低，或只注意增产不注意节约，或宁愿生产原有的某些滞销产品而不愿承担国家急需的杂活，或放松新产品试制工作，或依靠突击，靠提高劳动强度来实行增产等等现象，这些作法都是不对的，应当及时纠正。
    增产节约工作，既是应在加强计划管理，推行作业计划的基础上来进行，所以它是一项概括全面的工作，因之企业的领导同志必须掌握计划工作中的平衡方法，照顾到工作的各个方面，使之彼此衔接，互相配合，环绕中心，推动各种工作前进。应把平衡方法视为加强计划性，提高工作效率的基本方法之一。
    在增产节约运动中，既要动员群众和依靠群众，那么，及时地推广和交流各种先进经验，就应成为企业内部和企业之间的一项极其重要的工作，各级领导必须加以充分的注意。
    在增产节约运动中，企业应当采取各种必要的和适当的措施，以保障职工的安全生产，要适当照顾他们的福利，要有适当的奖励办法，给予职工应有的鼓励。
    机械工业的增产节约运动，已在逐步深入开展，我们深信在正确的方向指导之下，在广大职工的努力之下，必然可以胜利完成任务。
