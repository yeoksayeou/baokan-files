    中苏石油股份公司各个主要生产部门的我国职工积极学习俄文，现在已有百分之八十以上的职工能直接接受苏联专家交代的工作任务，有些技术人员并能阅读俄文石油工业的书籍和杂志，对工作的帮助很大。
    各民族的职工除了利用业余时间进行俄文学习外，并在工作中向苏联专家学习会话。三年来，许多职工一直坚持着学习。现在，该公司炼油厂的副经理木尔扎巴衣（哈萨克族）、第一建筑处的副经理瓦力斯江（维吾尔族）等都能用俄语和苏联专家研究工作了。炼油厂的副总工程师徐文杰、化验室工程师章涛等现在也能阅读俄文业务书籍了。各族工人都先从机器、机件的名称学起，并在工作中学习常用俄语。现在钻井处、炼油厂和其他生产部门的许多技术工人，已能用俄语汇报工作，询问问题。
    中苏石油股份公司的我国行政干部和党委会对职工学习俄文十分重视。党委会还为职工们制订了学习制度，按职工不同的程度编成学习小组，并聘请了俄文教员；还定期举行测验。
