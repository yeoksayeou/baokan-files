Strengthen the International Solidarity of the Working Class

The Third World Trade Union Congress held in Vienna from October 10th to 21st was a great gathering of international working-class solidarity. With the efforts of the delegates from 79 national trade union organizations and directly elected by the working masses, representing 88,600,000 workers from various countries, the congress achieved great success.

Since the Second World Trade Union Congress in 1949, the international workers' movement, under the guidance of the World Federation of Trade Unions, has made great progress. The working classes of all countries have waged staunch struggles against the imperialist war policy, against the exploitation of capitalists, for living and democratic rights, and for peace, and have continuously achieved victories. The World Federation of Trade Unions actively supports the demands and struggles of the working classes of all countries, sincerely cares about their vital interests and aspirations, and spares no effort to strengthen the international solidarity of the working class. The World Federation of Trade Unions' clear stance in resolutely defending the interests of the working class and its activities in this regard have made its prestige and influence among the working masses of all countries grow day by day. The Third World Trade Union Congress unanimously praised the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which proves that the World Federation of Trade Unions is the banner of international workers' solidarity and struggle, unanimously supported by the working classes of all countries.

The holding of the Third World Trade Union Congress and its achievements are of great significance to the development of the international situation.

The current international situation is at an extremely critical stage. The realization of the Korean armistice has led to some easing of international tensions. This is a great victory for the world's peace-defending forces. This victory has greatly strengthened the power of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and made the development of the international situation more favorable to the desire of the people of all countries, especially the working classes of all countries, for peace and democracy. However, the international reactionary forces are not reconciled to the failures they have suffered, and are trying every possible means to continue to maintain international tensions, stubbornly refuse to resolve international disputes through consultation, continue to pursue a policy of aggression and war, and carry out various international provocations. This cannot but arouse the indignation and vigilance of the working classes of the world and the peace-loving people of all countries. The Third World Trade Union Congress noted this situation and, in its resolutions, called on the working classes of all countries to continue to work to ease international tensions in order to defeat the conspiracy of international reactionary forces to create war. In order to strengthen the struggle for peace, the congress declared December 19th of this year – the Vietnamese People's Resistance Day – as the International Day of Support for the Vietnamese People and the Struggle to Stop the Colonial War in Vietnam; in a letter to the workers and trade unions of European countries, the congress called on them, regardless of party affiliation or belief, to insist on taking united action against the American revival of West German militarism, against the ratification of the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty, and to support the German people's struggle for peace, democratic unification; the congress also passed a resolution condemning the US-Spanish military agreement, demanding that workers of all countries support the Spanish people and the working class. These resolutions fully demonstrate the working class's deep concern for the cause of peace and its unwavering commitment to the important responsibility of striving for peace. The strengthening of the actions of the working classes and peace-loving people of all countries to strive for peace is an important force for consolidating world peace, and it will inevitably lead to the failure of the war plans of the international reactionary forces.

The working classes of capitalist and colonial countries are facing increasingly unbearable living conditions. The monopoly capital of capitalist countries seeks maximum profits by cruelly plundering the working people of their own countries and colonial countries, causing them to fall into poverty and bankruptcy; as the general crisis of capitalism further deepens, they further strengthen the exploitation of the working people by implementing policies of expanding armaments and preparing for war and militarizing their national economies. Under the oppression of monopoly capital, the situation of the working people in capitalist and colonial countries is that taxes are increasing, real wages are decreasing, unemployment is increasing, and the profits of monopoly capitalists have reached unprecedented figures. At the same time, the freedom and democratic rights of the working people in capitalist and colonial countries are also being brutally deprived; monopoly capital is increasingly relying on strengthening fascist rule to suppress the resistance of the working people. Therefore, the Third World Trade Union Congress pointed out that the working class and trade unions of capitalist and colonial countries must actively struggle to improve living conditions; they must constantly strive to increase wages, full employment, equal pay for equal work, reduce taxes, abolish labor sweatshop systems and ensure safe and sanitary working conditions, widely implement the social insurance system for the working people, abolish anti-labor laws and protect trade union rights. The working classes of capitalist and colonial countries are carrying out their just struggles and are constantly receiving the sympathy and support of all progressive mankind.

The international monopoly capital's plunder of the working people of all countries is inseparable from their barbarous policies of enslaving the people of all countries. The imperialist countries, headed by the United States, are doing everything possible to maintain their rule over the colonies; US imperialism also dictates to other capitalist countries through enslaving so-called "aid" programs, forcing these countries to become economic and political appendages of the United States. The economic backwardness of colonial and semi-colonial countries, and the fact that capitalist countries that rely on the United States, including Britain, are forced to adopt policies that harm their own national economic interests, especially the policies of blockade and embargo, are the result of the loss of political and economic independence of these nations. At the same time, this is also a major reason why the lives of the working people in colonial, semi-colonial and capitalist countries enslaved by the United States are in a miserable situation. The working classes of these countries, especially the working classes of colonial and semi-colonial countries, have fully realized the absolute necessity of striving for national independence, and have closely combined their struggles for their own interests and peace with the struggle for national independence.

The continuous achievements and increasing living standards of the working classes in the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries are a great encouragement to the working people of capitalist and colonial countries. Their desire to strengthen solidarity with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries is by no means accidental. The international links between the working classes of the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries and the working people of capitalist and colonial countries are constantly strengthening.

In the cause of the working class, the idea of ​​unity is increasingly grasped by the masses. In the "Letter to the Working People of the World," the Third World Trade Union Congress called on the working classes of all countries to restore domestic and international unity and establish a united front to defend workers' demands. Unity is the working class's invincible weapon. The domestic and international unity of the working class is constantly strengthening. Recently, the unity of action of the working classes in Italy, France, Brazil, India, and Japan in victorious strike struggles is a vivid proof. In order to restore the international unity of the working class, the World Federation of Trade Unions has proposed that the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" and the "International Federation of Christian Trade Unions" take united action in the struggle, and this proposal has been widely supported by the working classes of all countries. The call of the Third World Trade Union Congress to restore the domestic and international unity of the working class reflects the universal desire of the working classes of all countries, and it is of particularly great significance. The working class's actions to strive for unity will undoubtedly bring new and great victories to the just cause of the working class.

The Third World Trade Union Congress has formulated a clear program for the future struggle of the working class and made a major contribution to the victorious development of the international workers' movement. The working people of the world will certainly strengthen their struggle to realize the tasks stipulated in the various resolutions of the congress.

### 加强工人阶级的国际团结

    加强工人阶级的国际团结
    从十月十日到二十一日在维也纳举行的世界工会第三次代表大会，是国际工人阶级伟大团结的大会。在参加会议的七十九个国家工会组织及自工人群众中直接选举出来的、代表着八千八百六十万工人群众的各国代表的努力下，大会取得了伟大的成就。
    自一九四九年世界工会第二次代表大会以后，国际工人运动在世界工联的指导下有了很大的发展。各国工人阶级为反对帝国主义的战争政策、反对资本家的剥削、争取生活和民主权利、争取和平而进行了坚强的斗争，并不断取得胜利。世界工联积极支持各国工人阶级的要求和斗争，真诚地关怀他们的切身利益和愿望，并不遗余力地为加强工人阶级的国际团结而努力。世界工联坚决维护工人阶级利益的明确立场和它为此而进行的活动，使它在各国工人群众中的威望和影响日益增长。世界工会第三次代表大会对世界工联的活动一致加以赞扬，这证明世界工联是各国工人阶级所一致拥护的国际工人团结斗争的旗帜。
    世界工会第三次代表大会的举行和它所获得的成就，对国际局势的发展有着重大的意义。
    目前的国际局势正处在一个极端紧要的阶段。朝鲜停战的实现，已使国际紧张局势开始有了一些缓和。这是全世界保卫和平力量的伟大胜利。这个胜利大大加强了以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的力量，而使国际局势的发展更加有利于各国人民，首先是各国工人阶级要求和平民主的愿望。但是，国际反动势力并不甘心于他们所遭受的失败，而在千方百计地企图继续保持国际紧张局势，顽固地拒绝协商解决国际争端，继续奉行侵略战争政策并进行各种国际挑衅。这不能不引起全世界工人阶级和各国爱好和平人民的愤慨和警惕。世界工会第三次代表大会注意到这种情势，在它的决议中号召各国工人阶级继续为争取缓和国际局势而努力，以击败国际反动势力制造战争的阴谋。为了加强争取和平的斗争，大会宣布以今年十二月十九日——越南人民抗战日为国际支援越南人民和争取停止越南殖民战争斗争日；大会在告欧洲各国工人与工会书中，要求他们不分党派和信仰，坚持采取一致行动，反对美国复活西德军国主义，反对批准巴黎条约和波恩条约，支持德国人民争取和平、民主统一的斗争；大会并通过决议谴责美西军事协定，要求各国工人支持西班牙人民和工人阶级。这些决议充分说明了工人阶级对和平事业的深切关怀，并毫不犹豫地担当起争取和平的重大责任。各国工人阶级与爱好和平人民争取和平行动的加强，是巩固世界和平的重要力量，它将使国际反动势力的战争计划遭到不可避免的失败。
    资本主义及殖民地国家的工人阶级正面临日益不能忍受的生活条件。资本主义国家的垄断资本，以惨酷地掠夺本国及殖民地国家劳动人民而使他们陷于贫困和破产的办法来追求最高利润；在资本主义总危机进一步加深的情况下，他们更以实行扩军备战和使本国经济军事化的政策，来加强对劳动人民的剥削。在垄断资本的压迫之下，资本主义和殖民地国家劳动人民的处境是捐税加重，实际工资减低，失业增加，而垄断资本家的利润却达到了空前未有的数字。与此同时，资本主义与殖民地国家的劳动人民的自由民主权利也遭到横暴的剥夺；垄断资本越来越依靠加强法西斯的统治来镇压劳动人民的反抗。因此，世界工会第三次代表大会指出，资本主义及殖民地国家的工人阶级及工会必须为改善生活条件而积极进行斗争；必须不断地争取提高工资，充分就业，同工同酬，减少捐税，取消劳动血汗制和保证工作的安全和卫生条件，广泛实行劳动人民的社会保险制度，废除反劳工法和保障工会权利。资本主义及殖民地国家的工人阶级正在进行着他们的正义的斗争，并不断得到全体进步人类的同情和支持。
    国际垄断资本对各国劳动人民的掠夺，是和他们奴役各国人民的野蛮政策分不开的。以美国为首的帝国主义国家正竭尽一切力量来维持它们对殖民地的统治；美国帝国主义并通过奴役性的所谓“援助”计划，对其他资本主义国家发号施令，迫使这些国家沦为美国的经济的和政治的附庸。殖民地、半殖民地国家经济上的落后状态，以及依靠美国的资本主义国家，包括英国在内，被迫采取危害自己民族经济利益的政策，特别是封锁禁运政策，这都是它们的民族在政治和经济上丧失了独立的结果。同时这也是殖民地、半殖民地及遭受美国奴役的资本主义国家劳动人民生活陷于悲惨状况的一个主要原因。这些国家的工人阶级，特别是殖民地、半殖民地国家的工人阶级已完全认识到争取民族独立的绝对必要性，而把他们争取切身利益及和平的斗争和争取民族独立的斗争紧密结合起来了。
    苏联、中国及人民民主国家的工人阶级在和平劳动中不断取得的成就和生活福利的增长，对资本主义及殖民地国家劳动人民是一个极大的鼓舞。他们要求加强与苏联、中国和人民民主国家的团结，这种日益强烈的愿望绝不是偶然的。苏联、中国及人民民主国家的工人阶级与资本主义及殖民地国家劳动人民间的国际联系正在不断加强。
    在工人阶级的事业中，团结的思想越来越掌握了群众。世界工会第三次代表大会在“告世界劳动人民书”中，要求各国工人阶级恢复国内和国际的团结，建立起保卫工人要求的统一战线。团结一致是工人阶级战无不胜的武器。工人阶级国内和国际的团结正在不断加强。最近，意大利、法国、巴西、印度、日本的工人阶级在胜利的罢工斗争中的行动一致，就是生动的证明。为了恢复工人阶级的国际团结，世界工联曾建议“国际自由工联”及“国际基督教工会联合会”在斗争中采取一致行动，这个建议得到各国工人阶级的广泛拥护。世界工会第三次代表大会要求恢复工人阶级国内和国际团结的号召，反映了各国工人阶级的普遍愿望，它具有特别重大的意义。工人阶级争取团结的行动，无疑将为工人阶级的正义事业带来新的、巨大的胜利。
    世界工会第三次代表大会为今后工人阶级的斗争制订了明确的纲领，对国际工人运动的胜利发展作出了重大的贡献。全世界劳动人民必将为实现大会各项决议所规定的任务而加强斗争。
