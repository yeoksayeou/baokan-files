    Jilin Forestry School's Serious Departmentalism Leads to Demolition of New Auditorium, Causing Waste
    Reader Zhao Jing writes: In the winter of 1952, Jilin Forestry School built an auditorium of 600 square meters in the Fifth District of Changchun City, costing over 200 million yuan. This auditorium was mainly built with wood. This August, when the school was to move to Jilin City, they did not hand over the auditorium to the local authorities for management, or temporarily preserve it for other uses, or transfer it to other agencies at a reduced price. Instead, they demolished the auditorium. At that time, the responsible comrade of the local farm suggested that the school not demolish the auditorium to avoid waste. However, the school principal said arrogantly: "This auditorium was built with logs allocated by the Forestry Department itself, and no one else can interfere with whether or not it is demolished." In this way, a building that could have been converted into a large granary or a mechanical storage warehouse was carelessly demolished. The demolished wood, except for some square pillars that were not damaged, was burned as firewood. The school's teachers and students used the wood to cook for half a month. The school principal also said: "We have plenty of wood, it doesn't matter if we burn some." I believe that this behavior of not cherishing the people's property and wasting national timber is wrong. The Jilin Provincial Forestry Department should deal with it.

    吉林林业学校本位主义严重拆毁新建礼堂造成浪费
    读者赵京来信：吉林林业学校一九五二年冬在长春市第五区建筑了六百平方公尺的礼堂一座，花费二亿余元。这个礼堂主要是用木材建成的。今年八月，学校要迁到吉林市去时，他们不把这座礼堂移交当地机关接管，或暂时保存留作别用，或折价转让给其他机关，竟将礼堂拆毁。当时，当地农场负责同志曾建议该校不要拆毁礼堂，以免造成浪费。但该校校长竟态度蛮横地说：“这个礼堂是林业厅自拨原木建筑起来的，拆不拆他人不得干涉。”就这样，一个原可以改作大粮仓或机械贮存库的建筑物就被胡乱地拆毁了。拆下的木料除一部分方柱没坏外，其余坏木料都当柴火烧了，该校教员、学生就用木料烧了半个月的饭。该校校长还说：“我们有的是木头，烧点没啥。”我认为这种不爱护人民财产、浪费国家木料的行为是错误的。吉林省林业厅应该加以处理。
