    Waste Incurred in Resuming Construction at Jinan Flour Mill, Shandong
    Reader Wei Fu writes: The Shandong Provincial State-Owned Jinan Flour Mill suffered a fire last spring due to careless operation. The entire machine building was destroyed, leaving only a few dilapidated offices, warehouses, and an aging boiler. Considering that existing flour mills still have significant untapped potential, the inconvenient location of this mill (requiring costly truck transportation for both raw materials and finished products), and the local market size as a small city making flour sales problematic, resuming operations at this mill is unnecessary. However, to secure approval from higher authorities, the Provincial Industry Company fabricated information in the "Project Task Book," inflating flour sales figures by more than double, significantly reducing costs, and reporting the reconstruction cost as only 1.2-1.3 billion yuan. After the "Project Task Book" was approved, the Industry Company submitted a preliminary design, increasing the investment figure to 1.5 billion yuan. By the time the technical design was submitted, the Industry Company had increased the investment to 1.8 billion yuan.

    After the technical design was approved, the weather turned cold, making construction impossible. Consequently, the Industry Company went on a spree of ordering machinery and purchasing materials, while also submitting a supplementary budget requesting that the investment figure be revised to 2 billion yuan. In reality, even 2 billion yuan would not be enough.

    During the anti-bureaucracy struggle, this matter was exposed, and the resumption work was forced to stop. However, 600-700 million yuan worth of construction materials that had already been purchased were temporarily stockpiled, and some of the cement had already hardened. It is suggested that the Shandong Provincial Industry Company quickly make proper arrangements for the aftermath to avoid greater losses to state property.

### 山东济宁面粉厂复厂工程中造成浪费

专栏：读者来信摘要

    山东济宁面粉厂复厂工程中造成浪费
    读者蔚馥来信：山东省地方国营济宁面粉厂在去年春天因为操作不慎而发生火灾，机楼全部烧毁，只剩下几间摇摇欲坠的办公室、仓库和一个超龄的锅炉。由于目前现有面粉厂还有很大的潜力没有得到发挥，这个厂的厂址所在地交通不便，原料运进、成品运出都靠汽车，成本很高；而本地又是一个小城市，面粉销路成问题，因此，这个厂并无恢复的必要。但省实业公司为使上级批准修复该厂，在“计划任务书”上就捏造情况，把面粉销售数字扩大了二倍多，把成本也降低很多，而且把复厂费用只报为十二、三亿元。计划任务书经批准后，实业公司提出初步设计，就把投资数字增加为十五亿元。及至技术设计时，实业公司又把投资增到十八亿元。
    在技术设计批准后，天气已经寒冷，眼看不能施工了。于是实业公司就大肆订机器，购材料，还上报一个追加预算，要求把投资数字改为二十亿元。事实上，再有二十亿元也不够。
    反官僚主义斗争中，这件事被揭发了，复厂工作被迫停止。可是已经购置的六、七亿元的建筑材料就被暂时积压，而且一部分水泥已经发硬了。建议山东省实业公司赶紧作好善后工作，以免国家资财遭受更大的损失。
