Put Selling Grain into the Production Increase and Economy Practice Plan
    After studying the newspaper editorial on increasing production and practicing economy, the Zhang Zhiquan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dazhai Village, Yuci County, Shanxi Province, formulated a three-month plan for increasing production and practicing economy based on specific conditions. The plan called for increasing grain production by 8,860 jin through autumn harvest and sideline production, increasing cash income by 55 million yuan, and selling 2,000 jin of wheat and 13,000 jin of grain to the state. Under the leadership of Zhang Zhiquan, the cooperative members have already sold more than 2,000 jin of wheat to the state, and the villagers are also actively selling wheat to the state. The farmers who sold wheat bought cotton, cloth, salt, and production materials from the supply and marketing cooperative on the spot. The members of the Zhang Zhiquan Agricultural Production Cooperative recently wrote to workers across the country, expressing their determination to support the country's economic construction. The letter stated: Although our crops suffered from frost, floods, and droughts this year, due to the use of the new walking plows made by our worker brothers and deep plowing (accounting for 80% of the cooperative's cultivated land), the use of seed dressing and pest control agents, and the use of phosphate fertilizer and soil fertilizer powder, the yield per mu still increased by an average of 15 jin compared to last year. These facts have educated us and made us clearly realize the importance of the worker-peasant alliance and mutual support between workers and peasants. In addition to doing a good job in autumn harvest and autumn plowing, we also guarantee to pay the public grain well and sell grain to the state to support national construction.

Sell More Than 10,000 Jin of Grain to the State Again
    The members of the Wu Chun'an Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiliang Village, Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, responded to the call for increasing production and practicing economy, discussed the significance of increasing production and practicing economy, compared their current lives with the past, and recognized the happy prospects of the country's industrialization and socialism, which boosted their production enthusiasm. In addition to the 10,000 jin of wheat that the cooperative had already sold to the state, it decided to sell another 10,301 jin to the state to support the country's economic construction. The cooperative also formulated a plan for increasing production and practicing economy. The cooperative's autumn crops have now been harvested, and these crops should be threshed cleanly to yield an extra two jin per mu; cotton picking should improve quality and avoid the loss of six jin of cotton per mu in the past; peanuts in the fields have not yet been harvested, so they should be plowed and harrowed twice more to strive for an extra 20 jin per mu; wheat straw should be threshed again. It is estimated that the extra grain and cotton will be worth more than 5.9 million yuan. The cooperative should actively prepare for next year's production and strive to fertilize 95% of the land next year. In life, we should pay attention to saving food, sell more grain to the state, use the money to purchase production materials, and strive for increased production next year.

Sell Grain, Buy Oxen and Farm Tools
    Many farmers in Jiangsu Province, after harvesting rice, immediately sold the grain to the state to add oxen, farm tools, and daily necessities to prepare for winter production. Youth League member Liu Zhengxi has already sold 200 jin of grain and plans to sell another 300 jin to repair the waterwheel. Farmer Wang Dadie of Xinqiao Township, Liuhe, bought a new calf after the autumn harvest, added a boat, and the carts, plows, and rakes were all shiny with oil. Yu Chunmao, a farmer in Xinghua, harvested more than 3,500 jin of rice from six mu of rice paddies. He sold the rice in the cooperative and immediately bought wood to convert the small boat into a large boat, preparing to dredge mud and strive for more grain next year. Seventeen heads of cattle have been added to Yiren Township, Yifeng District, Yancheng County, after the autumn harvest. Farmers in Tianyi and Changjian Townships, Zhongji District, Guanyun County, bought 85 new-style walking plows within ten days. In addition to the need for oxen and farm tools, farmers also purchased a large number of daily necessities after selling grain to the cooperative.

Political Education Enhanced the Patriotic Enthusiasm of Cooperative Members
    The Yangjingdi Township Wu Houli Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, attached importance to the work of political and ideological education, which enhanced the patriotic enthusiasm of its members. Recently, the members actively responded to the call for increasing production and practicing economy, and formulated a plan to increase production and save more than 57,000 jin of grain and sell more than 25,500 jin of grain to the state this winter. The Wu Houli Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, adapted to local natural conditions, learned from the development direction of the Li Shunda Cooperative, focused on agriculture, and appropriately developed forestry and animal husbandry production, so that agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production supported each other. As a result, agricultural production was improved and the income of cooperative members was increased. This year, the cooperative still harvested 10% more than the village average under the severe drought. The average autumn field per mu harvested 80 jin more than the general mutual aid group, and 176 jin more than individual farmers. In addition to paying attention to careful cultivation, moisture conservation, increased fertilization, timely sowing, improving varieties according to soil quality, and carrying out close planting in agriculture, the Wu Houli Cooperative also paid attention to mountain construction, carried out afforestation, cultivated many fruit trees, delineated pastoral areas on forest slopes, built the Heping Reservoir with a capacity of 160,000 dan of water, and used more than 30 water wells for the development of animal husbandry and irrigation. The fact that the cooperative's mountain construction and the increase in the income of cooperative members have improved the enthusiasm of many farmers to participate in production cooperative organizations and encouraged the production enthusiasm and patriotic enthusiasm of cooperative members.

Enthusiastically Selling Grain and Buying Cloth, The Market is Unprecedentedly Prosperous
    Longdong Township, located in the mountainous area of ​​Wulong County, Sichuan Province, has achieved a bumper harvest this year. Farmers enthusiastically sell grain and buy cloth from the cooperative. This year, the corn and rice harvested in Longxing Village, the township, can average 686 jin per person. Coupled with miscellaneous grains and sideline income, each person can get an average of 1,000 jin of grain per year. This place is located on the border of Sichuan and Guizhou and is the transportation hub from Sichuan to Guizhou. The terrain is dangerous. Before liberation, it had always been a gathering place for bandits. Farmers were often looted and had no intention of farming. After sowing seeds every spring, they did not care about them. In autumn, the corn grew as high as grass, and the planted rice "failed to harvest nine out of ten years." After liberation, the people's government vigorously helped farmers improve agricultural tools, improve farming methods, and provide loans to build water conservancy projects every year. Now the scene here has completely changed. In the past, some girls who were fourteen or five years old had never worn clothes and pants, but now they are all wearing new clothes. The phenomenon of farmers wearing coir raincoats and coir-wrapped feet is no longer visible. People who went to the market every three days crowded the grain purchasing station of the cooperative. During the autumn harvest, according to the statistics of only two market visits, the cooperative sold more than 2 million yuan of cloth. Longdong Township, which used to be full of dilapidated fields and opium dens, is now full of prosperity.

    为了祖国建设，把粮食卖给国家
    把售粮列入增产节约计划
    山西榆次县大寨村张志全农业生产合作社，经过学习报纸上关于增产节约的社论以后，根据具体情况，定出了三个月增产节约计划，要求通过秋收和副业生产，增产原粮八千八百六十斤，增加现金收入五千五百万元，并把二千斤小麦和一万三千斤原粮卖给国家。在张志全带动下，社员现在已经卖给国家小麦二千多斤，村里的群众也纷纷向国家出卖小麦。出卖小麦的农民，当场就从供销合作社买了棉花、布匹、食盐和生产资料。张志全农业生产合作社的社员最近并向全国工人写信，表示他们支援祖国经济建设的决心。信中说：我们的庄稼今年虽然受了冻灾、水灾、旱灾，但由于使用了工人老大哥新制造的步犁，进行了深耕（占全社耕地面积百分之八十），使用了药剂拌种和除虫，使用了磷肥和肥田粉，结果，每亩地还是平均比去年增产了十五斤粮食。这些事实教育了我们，使我们明确认识了工农联盟，工农彼此支援的重要性。我们除把秋收秋耕工作做好外，还保证缴好公粮，把粮食卖给国家，支援祖国建设。

    再卖给国家一万多斤粮
    山西翼城县西梁村吴春安农业生产合作社的社员，响应增产节约的号召，讨论了增产节约的意义，各人把自己现在的生活和过去作了对比，认识了祖国工业化和社会主义的幸福远景，生产情绪高涨。全社除前已卖给国家小麦一万斤外，决定要再卖给国家一万零三百零一斤，支援国家经济建设。该社还订立了增产节约计划。全社秋庄稼现在都已经收割，要把这些庄稼打净，每亩多收二斤；摘棉花要提高质量，避免过去每亩丢花六斤的损失；地里的花生还没有收，要多犁二次，多耙二次，每亩争取多收二十斤；要把麦秸再打一遍。以上多收的粮棉，估计可值五百九十多万元。全社要积极准备明年生产，争取明年百分之九十五的土地都上肥料。在生活上要注意节约粮食，把更多的粮食卖给国家，拿钱购置生产资料，争取明年增产。

    卖出粮食，买进耕牛农具
    江苏省许多农民，收割了稻子以后，立刻把粮食卖给了国家，以添置耕牛、农具和生活资料，准备进行冬季生产。青年团员刘正喜已经卖了二百斤粮食，还准备再卖三百斤来修理水车。六合新桥乡农民王大迭秋收后新买了一条小牛，添了一只船，车、犁、耙都油得亮光光的。兴化农民余春茂六亩水稻收了三千五百多斤谷子，他在合作社出卖了稻子，马上买了木料，把小船改成大船，准备罱泥，争取明年打更多的粮食。盐城县义丰区于任乡秋收后已添了十七头耕牛。灌云县仲集区天乙、长见两乡农民十天内就买了八十五张新式步犁。农民们除了需要耕牛、农具以外，还在卖给合作社粮食后，大量购买各种日用品。
    政治教育提高了社员爱国热情
    山西平顺县羊井底乡武侯梨农林牧生产合作社重视政治思想教育的工作，提高了社员爱国热情。最近，社员积极响应了增产节约的号召，订出今冬增产节约五万七千多斤粮食，和卖给国家两万五千五百多斤粮食的计划。武侯梨农林牧生产合作社，适应当地自然条件，学习了李顺达社的发展方向，以农业为主，适当发展林牧生产，使农林牧生产互相支援，结果，提高了农业生产，增加了社员收入，今年该社在严重旱灾袭击下，仍比全村平均多收了一成，每亩秋田平均比一般互助组多收八十斤，比个体农民多收一百七十六斤。武侯梨社除了在农业方面讲求精耕保墒，增施肥料，适时下种，根据土质改良品种及进行密植外，并注意山地建设，开展了植树造林工作，栽培许多果树，在林坡上划出牧区，新建了可容十六万担水的和平蓄水池，并用三十多眼水井作发展牧畜和灌溉之用。该社山地建设和社员收入增加的事实，提高了许多农民参加生产合作组织的积极性，鼓舞了社员的生产积极性和爱国热情。（王良玉）
    踊跃卖粮买布，集市空前繁荣
    四川省武隆县境内高山地带的龙洞乡，今年获得了丰收。农民踊跃向合作社卖粮买布。该乡隆兴村今年收下的玉米和谷子，平均每人可有六百八十六斤，加上杂粮和副业收入，每人每年平均可得到一千斤粮食。这个地方位于川黔边境，是四川通往贵州的交通枢纽，地势险要，解放前，一直是盗匪集聚的地方。农民经常被抢掠，无心种地，每年春天撒下种子以后就不管了，到秋天，苞谷长得像草高，种的谷子“十年九不收”。解放后，人民政府每年都大力帮助农民改进农具，改进耕作法，并贷款兴修水利。现在这里的景象完全变了，过去有的十四、五岁都没有穿过衣裤的女子，现在都穿上了新衣服。农民用棕衣和棕包脚的现象，现在看不见了。三天赶一集场的人们，把合作社粮食收购站挤得水泄不通。秋收中，仅据两次赶场的统计，合作社就卖了二百多万元的布匹。过去满街破烂场和烟馆的龙洞乡街上，现在充满了繁荣景象。
