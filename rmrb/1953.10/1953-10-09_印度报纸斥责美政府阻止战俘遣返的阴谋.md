Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 8th:

    Most Indian newspapers have unanimously condemned the U.S. government's continued attempts to destabilize the Korean armistice and its conspiracy with the Syngman Rhee clique to prevent the repatriation of prisoners of war (POWs).

    "The National Herald" wrote in its editorial on October 6th: "If the armistice is broken and disputes break out again in Korea, then the whole world will attribute this responsibility to the United States." The editorial said that the armistice was achieved after an agreement was reached on the issue of POW repatriation, "and the United Nations Command—that is, the U.S. Command—is now doing everything possible to prevent the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) from completing its assigned task; if the NNRC becomes impatient and abandons its task, then what state will the armistice be in?"

    The newspaper editorial explained the reason for the delay in the explanatory work, pointing out: The United Nations Command "disagrees to extending the term of explanation, and at the same time obstructs the start of the explanation work. This is very suitable for America's friends—Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek. Because the POWs will not be free to change their minds, and because the political conference—even if it is convened—may not be able to reach an agreement on this issue within the prescribed one-month deadline, these POWs will be released as civilians; in other words: Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek can arbitrarily drag the POWs into their own armies."

    The newspaper editorial concluded: "This situation is full of serious possibilities, and now the United Nations should study what measures should be taken to determine whether the United Nations Command in Korea is truly realizing the purpose it has declared."

    "The Times of India" said in its editorial on October 5th: "So far, judging from the statements and attitudes of American spokespersons, they seem more interested in obstructing the NNRC and the Indian Expeditionary Force, which is executing the commission's resolutions, from resolving the repatriation issue within the prescribed ninety-day deadline. The question that can now be asked of the Americans is: Do they favor peace or do they favor war?"

    "Amrita Bazar Patrika" said in its editorial on October 6th: "Given that Syngman Rhee took the reckless action of releasing POWs when the armistice agreement was about to be signed, the possibility of a sudden breakdown of peace in the Far East cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is necessary for the United Nations and the U.S. government to take swift and effective measures to restrain Syngman Rhee's recklessness and control his penchant for troublemaking."

    "The Free Press Journal" published an editorial on October 5th entitled "American Conspiracy Fails," saying: "Even now, the U.S., Chiang, and Rhee clique have not ceased their conspiracy against the POWs who have been handed over to the Repatriation Commission. After their prior preparations, they are now using newer conspiracies and tricks to make the explanatory work unable to start at all, and even if it starts, to fail." The editorial continued: "In addition, it is delaying the start of the explanatory work under various pretexts, attempting to shorten the duration of the explanatory work, and attempting to disrupt the established timetable of the armistice."

    The editorial also pointed out: "The United States refused to allow India and three other Asian countries to participate in the political conference, thus creating a deadlock in the political conference. On the other hand, it is also attempting to create a stalemate in the repatriation of POWs by creating riots and threatening the Indian custodial troops. Although the United States was forced to sign the armistice under the pressure of the peace policies of the Chinese and Korean sides and world public opinion, it has not even taken a single step to facilitate the final resolution of the Korean issue."

    The October 6th editorial of "The Tribune," speaking of South Korea's threat to take armed action against the Indian custodial troops, said: "This threat is obviously undermining the Allied Command's guarantee of the inviolability of the demilitarized zone and the provision of a peaceful environment."

    The "Bombay Chronicle" said in its editorial on October 6th: "The question for the United Nations to consider is: If a tragedy is carelessly created in the neutral zone in Korea, what will be the consequences not only for peace in Korea, but inevitably for the world?"

### 印度报纸斥责美政府阻止战俘遣返的阴谋

    印度报纸斥责美政府阻止战俘遣返的阴谋
    【新华社新德里八日电】大多数的印度报纸一致斥责美国政府仍然企图使朝鲜停战保持不稳定状态，并阴谋与李承晚集团勾结一起来阻止战俘的遣返。
   “国民先驱报”十月六日的社论写道：“假如停战遭到破坏，朝鲜再度发生纠纷，那么，全世界必将把这个责任归之于美国。”社论说，停战是在战俘遣返问题达成协议之后才得以实现的，“而联合国军司令部——就是美国司令部——现在却在用尽一切力量来使中立国遣返委员会不能完成委托给它的任务；要是中立国遣返委员会因不耐烦而放弃了它的任务，那么，停战将处于什么样的地步呢？”
    该报社论说明了解释工作拖延的原因，它指出：联合国军司令部“不同意延长解释期限，同时又阻挠解释工作的开始，这是非常适合美国的朋友们——李承晚和蒋介石——的口味的。由于战俘们将不能自由改变他们的意志，由于政治会议——即使开成的话——也可能在规定的一个月限期内不能就这个问题达成协议，这样战俘们就将被释放为平民；换句话说：李承晚和蒋介石就可以任意把战俘强拉进他们自己的军队里去。”
    该报社论最后说：“这种情况充满了严重的可能性，现在应该由联合国研究究竟应该采取什么办法，朝鲜的联合国军司令部是不是真正在实现它所宣布的目的。”
   “印度时报”十月五日的社论说：“迄今为止，从美国发言人的谈话及态度看来，他们更感到兴趣的似乎是阻挠中立国遣返委员会及执行该委员会决议的印度派遣军在规定的九十天限期内解决遣返问题。现在可以向美国人提出这样的问题：它是赞成和平呢，还是赞成战争？”
   “甘露市场报”十月六日的社论说：“鉴于李承晚在停战协定就要签订的时候曾采取了释放战俘的狂妄行动，所以远东和平突然破裂的可能性就不能够被忽视。因此，联合国和美国政府有必要采取迅速而有效的措施，来抑制李承晚的狂妄野心和控制他捣乱的癖性。”
    “自由报”在十月五日以“美国的阴谋遭到失败”为题发表社论说：“甚至到现在，美、蒋、李集团还没有停止它对已经交给遣返委员会的战俘所怀的阴谋。在它们事先准备之后，它们现在又在使用更新的阴谋和诡计，来使解释工作根本不能开始，而即使开始的话，也要失败。”社论继续说：“此外，它正在以各种藉口延迟解释工作的开始，试图缩短解释工作的期限，并试图这样来破坏停战的已定的时间表。”
    社论还指出：“美国拒绝印度和其他三个亚洲国家参加政治会议，因而造成了政治会议的僵局。另一方面，它还正在用制造暴动和威胁印度看管部队的方法，试图制造遣返战俘的僵局。美国虽然在中朝方面的和平政策和世界舆论的压力下而被迫签订了停战，然而它甚至未采取一项步骤来促成朝鲜问题的最后解决。”
    十月六日的“论坛报”的社论讲到南朝鲜威胁要对印度看管部队采取武装行动时说：“这种威胁显然是破坏联军司令部对非军事区的不受侵犯与给以和平环境所作的保证的。”
    “孟买纪事报”十月六日的社论说：“联合国要考虑的问题是：如果在朝鲜中立区轻率地造成悲剧的话，不仅对朝鲜和平，而且不可避免地对世界，将会有怎样的结果。”
