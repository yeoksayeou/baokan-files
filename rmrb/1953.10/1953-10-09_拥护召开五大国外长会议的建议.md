The Foreign Minister of our country, Zhou Enlai, authorized to represent the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, issued a statement expressing full agreement with the proposal made by the Soviet government in its note to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States on September 28th, namely: to convene a five-power foreign ministers conference of China, the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and the United States to review measures to ease international tensions; and to discuss the resolution of the German question at a meeting attended by the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and the United States. This is another major effort by the socialist and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union to further ease international tensions after achieving the Korean armistice. The Chinese people express their heartfelt endorsement and support for this sincere effort to seek world peace.

Resolving all international disputes by peaceful means and striving for a comprehensive relaxation of international tensions to consolidate peace in the Far East and the world is the steadfast policy that our government has always pursued. Article 54 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates: "The principle of the foreign policy of the People's Republic of China is to guarantee the independence, freedom and territorial integrity of the country, to uphold lasting international peace and friendly cooperation among the peoples of all countries, and to oppose the aggressive policies and war policies of imperialism." Our government and people have made unremitting efforts to achieve this peaceful foreign policy and will continue to strive for it in the future.

This consistent peace policy of our government is fully in line with the peace-oriented foreign policy consistently pursued by the Soviet Union. The Soviet government and its leaders have always advocated resolving all international disputes and outstanding international issues through peaceful consultation, opposed imperialist war policies, and have made great contributions to easing international tensions through their own practical actions, winning unanimous praise and support from peace-loving people around the world. The Soviet government's note to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States on September 28th further specified this policy of seeking international peace, which provides a reasonable and practical basis for the peaceful resolution of international problems.

No one can doubt that, in the current international situation, convening a meeting attended by the foreign ministers of China, the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and the United States to review measures to ease international tensions would make a positive contribution. Because in this way, the foreign ministers of the five major powers can exchange views with each other in a spirit of consultation on a relatively broad range of issues, thereby promoting the possibility of resolving many major international issues in a manner that conforms to the interests of the people of all countries concerned.

No one can doubt that today only peaceful consultations among the five major powers can truly resolve all major international problems. Georgy Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, clearly pointed out at the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: "The entire current situation shows that the major powers bear a special responsibility for further easing international tensions and resolving disputes through negotiations. The United Nations Charter places the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security on them." However, past facts have shown that the United States government is unwilling to take this path. The United States, holding France and Britain hostage, refuses to adopt methods of consultation with the Soviet Union and attempts to completely bypass China, a major country with hundreds of millions of people, in order to arbitrarily handle international problems. This policy of the United States government, regardless of the facts, can only prove that it hopes to continue to maintain international tensions, has no intention of resolving existing international disputes, and evades fulfilling its obligations to peacefully resolve international problems. The Chinese people have proven themselves to be a powerful force in safeguarding world peace, and we have every reason to demand the restoration of our legitimate rights in all international affairs.

Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out in the statement: "The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the realization of the Korean armistice has created favorable conditions for easing international tensions and has proven that all international disputes can be resolved through peaceful consultation. The urgent task at present is to resolutely ensure the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, strictly prevent the resurgence of aggressive wars, stop all conspiracies to obstruct and undermine the political conference, and promote the prompt convening of the political conference under conditions with neutral countries participating, in order to negotiate the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the peaceful settlement of the Korean question."

The Chinese and Korean people have consistently sought a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, and after the armistice was achieved, they faithfully implemented all the provisions of the armistice agreement and continuously worked to consolidate the Korean armistice and strive for a successful political conference. In order for the political conference to be convened and have good results, we firmly believe that it should and must be a "round table conference," that is, not only representatives from both sides of the Korean armistice should participate, but also neutral countries that are concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Only in this way can the political conference proceed in a harmonious atmosphere, and only in this way can the political conference be guaranteed to succeed on the basis of consultation.

However, as people can clearly see, the United States is doing its utmost to obstruct and undermine the implementation of the armistice agreement and the rapid convening of the political conference, in order to prevent a further easing of the international situation and attempt to worsen it. The reason why the Korean armistice cannot be stabilized at present and is facing increasingly serious threats of destruction, and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is fraught with difficulties, lies here.

The United States' unreasonable attitude of obstructing and undermining the work of explaining to and visiting prisoners of war is intolerable to any honest person. Now, the United States is still ignoring the accusations of public opinion and has become even more angry because it appears so embarrassed in the face of the fair work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, has unreasonably accused Lieutenant General K.S. Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. He cannot provide any reasons to refute the recent necessary measures taken by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and he completely avoids mentioning the dark and terrifying facts pointed out in the statement of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission that the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents controlled the prisoner of war camps. His intention is to coerce the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to adopt a hands-off or even cooperative attitude towards the terrorist rule of the US, Rhee, and Chiang agents in the prisoner of war camps. How can any neutral country with self-respect succumb to the United States' blatant policy of forcibly detaining prisoners of war and threatening attitude? However, in order to force the neutral countries to be accomplices in its criminal policy, the United States is mobilizing its domestic reactionary newspapers and the two puppet groups of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek to carry out a barrage of denunciations and intimidations. The South Korean government has even threatened to attack the Indian guard troops and fabricate a so-called "large-scale escape" plot to forcibly detain prisoners of war. US Secretary of State Dulles publicly stated that he was not happy with the activities of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which is chaired by India. This statement by Dulles and other US officials is clearly a predetermined step by the US government to encourage, support, and assist the Syngman Rhee group and the US agents in the prisoner of war camps to abduct large numbers of prisoners of war. All of this proves that the US government is deliberately undermining the armistice agreement and intensifying international tensions.

It is no coincidence that the US delegation repeatedly obstructed the discussion of the issue of expanding the membership of the political conference at the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. World public opinion believes that the proposal put forward by China and North Korea that the political conference should be attended by the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma is completely reasonable. However, under the manipulation of the United States, the Eighth UN General Assembly refused to discuss the reasonable proposals of China and North Korea. The Political Committee of the Eighth UN General Assembly even placed the Korean issue, which had already been included on the agenda, at the end of the discussion, in order to evade resolving the differences of opinion on the membership of the political conference in a timely manner on this agenda. The United Nations has once again abandoned the purposes and responsibilities stipulated in the Charter, further tarnishing its reputation; and this policy implemented by the US delegation is clearly contrary to the spirit of international consultation.

The United States' unreasonable stance of continuing to obstruct the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate status in the United Nations at the Eighth UN General Assembly particularly clearly exposes its continued hostility towards peace in Asia and its obstruction of the restoration of normal international relations. It has not abandoned its arrogant plan to turn Asia into a hotbed for a new world war. The US proposal adopted by the Eighth UN General Assembly to "not consider within the year" the issue of restoring the People's Republic of China's status in the United Nations fully demonstrates the US attempt to drag this issue out for a long time, making it impossible to resolve various issues related to peaceful cooperative relations between countries, especially major issues related to Asia. Many powerful figures in the United States, like people suffering from night blindness, even claim that the People's Republic of China does not exist. It is the United States ruled by these people that is extremely vain and reactionary in betting its war adventure stakes on scum like the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang; and for this purpose, they continue to force this political corpse, which can only represent its own death fate, into China's seat in the United Nations. However, the reactionary and aggressive forces of the United States, in stubbornly pursuing their "policy of strength," are obviously increasingly feeling unable to ignore the irresistible powerful movement of the people demanding negotiated solutions to international disputes. Thus, they began to say some nice words, as if they were very willing to end the current tension. In his speech on September 2nd, Dulles, in an arrogant and tough posture, announced that the United States would not hesitate to prepare to expand the war into Chinese territory in order to pursue its war policy in Korea and Indochina; but by September 17th, he suddenly transformed himself into an apostle of peace at the United Nations General Assembly, talking at length about the US willingness to negotiate solutions to various problems, even advocating a peaceful resolution to the Indochina war. If the US government is really willing to turn these words spoken by Dulles into actual actions, that would be welcome, but in that case, the US must at least do fewer bad things from now on, such as breaking agreements, obstructing negotiations, issuing orders everywhere, and acting like a king. If the US government wants to make some semblance of planning for peaceful consultation, first of all, there is no reason not to consider and accept the reasonable proposal of the Soviet Union on September 28th.

The whole world is waiting to see how the US government passes this new test. In any case, the whole world has once again seen from the Soviet government's note and our government's statement that the great Soviet people and the Chinese people are unyieldingly standing together with the people of the world, working together to promote the realization of peaceful consultations between governments of all countries in order to consolidate international peace and security.

### 拥护召开五大国外长会议的建议

    拥护召开五大国外长会议的建议
    我国外交部部长周恩来受权代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府发表声明，表示完全赞同苏联政府九月二十八日在致法英美三国政府的照会中所提出的建议，即：召开中苏法英美五国外长会议，审查缓和国际紧张局势的措施；在由苏法英美四国外长参加的会上讨论解决德国问题。这是以苏联为首的和平民主阵营在争取实现了朝鲜停战之后，进一步争取缓和国际紧张局势的又一重大努力。中国人民对于这种谋求世界和平的真诚努力，表示衷心的拥护和支持。
    用和平方法解决一切国际争端，争取全面缓和国际紧张局势以巩固远东和世界的和平，是我国政府所一直奉行的坚定不移的政策。我国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第五十四条规定：“中华人民共和国外交政策的原则，为保障本国独立、自由和领土主权的完整，拥护国际的持久和平和各国人民间的友好合作，反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。”我国政府和人民为争取实现这一和平外交政策，曾作过不断的努力，今后仍将为此而奋斗不懈。
    我国政府的这种始终不渝的和平政策，是与苏联一贯所执行的和平外交政策完全一致的。苏联政府及其领袖历来就主张用和平协商方式解决一切国际纠纷和悬而未决的国际问题，反对帝国主义战争政策，并已经用自己的实际行动对缓和国际紧张局势作出了极大的贡献，赢得了全世界爱好和平人民的一致赞扬和支持。苏联政府九月二十八日致法英美三国政府的照会，把它这种谋求国际和平的政策进一步具体化了，这就为和平解决国际问题提供了一个合理的实践的基础。
    谁也不能怀疑，在目前国际形势下，召开有中苏法英美五国外长参加的会议，来审查缓和国际紧张局势的措施是会有肯定的贡献的。因为这样，将使五大国的外长们能就比较广泛的问题以协商精神相互交换意见，从而促使许多重大的国际问题有可能以符合于有关各国人民的利益的方式得到解决。
    谁也不能怀疑，今天只有五大国进行和平协商，才有可能真正解决一切重大的国际问题。苏联部长会议主席马林科夫在苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议上曾明白指出：“整个当前的形势表明，对于通过谈判进一步缓和国际紧张局势和解决争执问题，大国负有特别的责任。联合国宪章正是把维持国际和平和安全的主要责任加在它们的身上的。”可是，过去的事实表明，美国政府是不愿意走这条路的。美国挟持着英法两国，拒绝采取与苏联协商的方法，并且企图根本撇开中国这样一个拥有数亿人口的大国，以便武断地处理国际问题。美国政府这种不顾事实的政策，只能证明它希图继续维持国际紧张形势，无意于解决国际间所存在的争执，并规避履行它对和平解决国际问题所应负的义务。中国人民已经证明自己是维护世界和平的一支强大力量，我们有充分的理由要求恢复自己在一切国际事务中的合法权利。
    周恩来外长在声明中指出：“中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为，朝鲜停战的实现，已为缓和国际紧张局势创造了有利的条件，并已证明一切国际争端是可以用和平协商的方法求得解决的。当前的迫切的任务是坚决保证朝鲜停战协定的实施，严防侵略战争的再起，制止一切阻挠和破坏政治会议的阴谋，促成政治会议能够在有中立国参加的条件下的迅速召开，以便协商撤退一切外国军队与和平解决朝鲜问题等问题。”
    中朝人民一贯谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决，在停战实现之后又忠实地执行了停战协定的一切条款，并不断为巩固朝鲜停战、争取开好政治会议而努力。为使政治会议能够召开并有良好结果，我们坚决认为它应该而且必须是“圆桌会议”，即不仅有朝鲜停战的双方代表参加，而且应该有关心和平解决朝鲜问题的中立国家参加。只有这样，才有可能使政治会议在和谐的气氛中进行，才有可能保障政治会议在协商的基础上得到成功。
    但是，正如人们所清楚地看到的，美国正在竭力阻挠和破坏停战协定的实施及政治会议的迅速召开，以阻止国际局势的进一步缓和，并企图使之更加恶化。目前朝鲜停战之所以不能稳定而且遭受到日益严重的破坏威胁，和平解决朝鲜问题之所以困难丛生，原因就在这里。
    美方阻挠和破坏对战俘解释和访问工作的蛮横无理态度，是任何正直的人士所不能容忍的。现在美方依然不顾公众舆论的指责，竟因它在中立国遣返委员会的公正工作面前显得狼狈不堪而更加恼羞成怒起来。联合国军总司令克拉克居然对中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅进行无理的指责。他提不出任何理由来反驳中立国遣返委员会最近的应有措施，他对中立国遣返委员会声明中所指出的美方一手布置蒋李特务控制战俘营场的黑暗恐怖事实，完全避而不谈。他的意思就是想威逼中立国遣返委员会对于美李蒋特务在战俘营的恐怖统治采取放手甚至是合作态度。试问任何一个有自尊心的中立国家，如何能在美国这种明目张胆的强迫扣留战俘政策以及威胁态度之下屈服呢？但美方为了逼使中立国来做它的罪恶政策的同谋者，却正在动员其国内反动报刊和李承晚、蒋介石两个傀儡集团进行漫天的叫骂恫吓，南朝鲜政府且扬言要攻击印度看管部队和制造所谓“大规模逃脱”的强迫扣留战俘阴谋。美国国务卿杜勒斯竟公然出面声称他对于以印度为主席的中立国遣返委员会的活动并不感觉高兴。杜勒斯以及其他美国官方人士的这种声明，显然是美国政府鼓励、支持和协助李承晚集团和美方派在战俘营中的特务大批劫走战俘的预定步骤。所有这一切，都证明美国政府蓄意破坏停战协定，加紧国际紧张局势。
    美国代表团在联合国第八届大会上一再阻挠讨论扩大政治会议的成员问题，尤其不是偶然的事。世界公正舆论都认为，中朝两国所提出的政治会议应有苏联、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和缅甸参加的建议，是完全合理的。但是，在美国的操纵下，八届联大竟拒绝讨论中朝两国的合理建议，八届联大政委会甚至对业已列入议程的朝鲜问题也放在最后讨论，以规避在这个议程上及时解决政治会议成员问题的分歧意见。联合国又一次违弃宪章所规定的宗旨和职责，使自己的威信更加扫地；而美国代表团所执行的这个政策，显然是与国际协商精神背道而驰的。
    美国在八届联大继续阻挠中华人民共和国恢复在联合国的合法地位的无理态度，特别明显地暴露出它依然敌视亚洲和平并阻挠国际正常关系的恢复，它并没有放弃要把亚洲变成新的世界大战的温床的狂妄计划。八届联大通过的所谓“年内不考虑”中华人民共和国恢复在联合国的地位问题的美国提案，充分证明美国企图把这个问题长期拖下去，使各种有关各国和平合作关系，特别是有关亚洲的重大问题无法解决。美国许多当权的人物像患夜盲病的人一样，竟声言中华人民共和国是不存在的。正是这些人物所统治的美国，正在极端虚妄和反动地把战争冒险的赌注押在蒋介石匪帮这样的渣滓上；而为了这个目的，它们就继续把这具只能代表它自己的死亡命运的政治僵尸硬塞在联合国的中国席位上。但是，美国反动侵略势力在顽固地推行其“实力政策”中，显然越来越感到不能漠视人民要求协商解决国际争端的不可抗拒的强大运动了。于是，它们便开始来说些漂亮话，仿佛非常愿意结束目前的紧张局势。杜勒斯在九月二日的演说中，还以妄自尊大的强硬姿态，宣布美国将不惜准备把战争扩大到中国领土之内，来在朝鲜和印度支那推行战争政策；但到了九月十七日，他在联合国大会上却忽然摇身一变而为和平使徒，大谈美国愿意协商解决各项问题，甚至是印度支那战争的和平解决的主张了。如果美国政府真的愿意把杜勒斯所说的这些话变为实际行动，那是值得欢迎的，但是这样美国就必须从现在起，至少少做一些破坏协定、阻挠协商、到处发号施令、称王称霸的坏事。美国政府如果想要做出一点打算和平协商的样子，首先，对于苏联九月二十八日的合理建议，就没有理由不加以考虑接受。
    全世界正在等着看美国政府如何通过这一次新的考验。无论如何，全世界从苏联政府的照会和我国政府的声明，又一次看到了，伟大的苏联人民和中国人民正在不屈不挠地与全世界人民在一起，同心协力来促使各国政府之间的和平协商得以实现，以求巩固国际的和平与安全。
