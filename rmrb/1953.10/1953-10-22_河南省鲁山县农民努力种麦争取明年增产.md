Farmers in Lushan County, Henan Province, are working hard to plant winter wheat well and strive to increase production next year.

As early as mid-August, the Lushan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a winter wheat production increase meeting, summarized the production increase experience of 1953, and formulated a production increase plan for 1954. Subsequently, all districts and townships held enlarged cadre meetings, people's representative meetings, and mutual aid and cooperation meetings to communicate and deploy the plan, and then launched a campaign to strive for increased winter wheat production in 1954.

During the break from autumn hoeing in mid-to-late August, various townships and villages in Lushan County mobilized farmers to remove weeds and accumulate fertilizer. By the end of August, according to incomplete statistics from nine districts, more than 722,000 cartloads of fertilizer had been accumulated, with an average of more than two cartloads of base fertilizer that could be applied per mu of wheat field. In Sigou Township, the amount of fertilizer accumulated reached an average of more than five cartloads per mu. The vast majority of farmers transported the fertilizer to the edge of the fields before the autumn harvest so that they could apply fertilizer and plow the land in time after the autumn harvest. All townships mobilized farmers to dry wheat seeds and exchange good seeds in a timely manner, and the problem of seed shortage for households lacking seeds was solved through mutual borrowing and exchange of wheat seeds. In order to ensure full seedlings, many townships also conducted germination rate tests on wheat seeds.

This year, Lushan County paid special attention to promoting the scientific cultivation techniques of winter wheat. The county's agricultural technology guidance station trained a large number of agricultural technology instructors. After the harvest of early autumn crops, the Eighth District held a wheat sowing demonstration and observation meeting and a new agricultural tool exhibition; the Eleventh District held a wheat production increase technology exhibition in conjunction with a materials exchange conference. At these two meetings, agricultural labor models Xin Zixiu and Su Dianxuan respectively introduced the Soviet Union's advanced winter wheat sowing technology and their own winter wheat production increase experience. All districts and townships also held forums for elderly farmers, meetings on cattle plows, and meetings on seed drills, etc., to study and exchange techniques for planting wheat and preparing the land, and promoted the close planting method. According to incomplete statistics, 1,405 close planting drills have been modified or newly made in the county. Farmers will adopt their own created sowing methods such as heavy drill method, overlapping drill method, and adjacent drill method.

This autumn, Lushan County is experiencing dry weather, and winter wheat sowing has encountered difficulties. Therefore, farmers throughout the county are combining autumn harvesting with drought resistance and moisture conservation. Farmers in all townships are checking soil moisture conditions, finding water sources, digging wells and opening canals for irrigation. So far, more than 300,000 mu of wheat fields in the county have been plowed or irrigated, and more than 30 percent of the wheat fields have been sown.

    河南省鲁山县农民努力种麦争取明年增产
    河南省鲁山县农民努力种好冬小麦，争取明年增产。
    早在八月中旬，中共鲁山县委员会就召开冬小麦增产会议，总结了一九五三年的增产经验，制定了一九五四年的增产计划。接着，各区、乡都召开扩大干部会议、人民代表会议、互助合作会议，进行传达和布置，然后展开了争取一九五四年冬小麦增产的运动。
    在八月中、下旬秋季挂锄的间隙，鲁山县各个乡、村先后发动农民铲草积肥。到八月底，据九个区的不完全统计，共积肥七十二万二千多车，平均每亩麦田可施底肥二车多。寺沟乡积肥数量达到平均每亩五车多。绝大多数农民都在秋收前把肥料运到地边，以便秋收后及时施肥，翻犁土地。各乡都发动农民及时翻晒麦种，交换良种，并以互借、互换麦种使缺种户的困难问题得到解决。为保证全苗，不少乡还作了麦种发芽率的试验。
    今年，鲁山县特别重视推广冬小麦的科学栽培技术。该县农业技术指导站训练了大批农业技术传授员。在早秋作物收获后，第八区举办了小麦播种表演观摩和新式农具展览大会；第十一区结合物资交流大会，举办了小麦增产技术展览会。在这两个会上，农业劳动模范辛自修、苏殿选分别介绍了苏联先进的冬小麦播种技术和他们自己的冬小麦增产经验。各区、乡还举行了老年农民座谈会、牛把会、耧把会等，研究交流种麦和整地的技术，推广了密植法。据不完全统计，全县已改制或新制密植耧一千四百零五张。农民们将采用自己创造的重耧法、套耧法和靠耧法等播种方法。
    鲁山县今秋天气干旱，冬小麦播种遇到了困难。因此，全县农民便结合秋收，进行抗旱保墒。各乡农民纷纷查墒情，找水源，打井开渠，进行灌溉。到目前为止，全县已有三十多万亩麦田经过犁耙或灌溉，并有百分之三十以上的麦田播种完毕。
