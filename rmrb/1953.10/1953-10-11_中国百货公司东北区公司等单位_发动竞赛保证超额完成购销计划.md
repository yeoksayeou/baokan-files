The Northeast China Department Store Company and the Shenyang Purchasing and Supply Station have mobilized all employees to strive to increase production and practice economy, discussed purchasing and sales plans, and are now launching a competition to ensure the overfulfillment of these plans.

The purchasing and sales plans of the Northeast China Department Store Company and the Shenyang Purchasing and Supply Station were formulated based on the idea of expanding commodity circulation. According to their business characteristics, these two units proposed: expanding the supply plan within the customs (关内) by 130 billion yuan, promoting the sales of 100 billion yuan of inventory goods within the region, recovering funds to purchase new goods, and solving the sales problem of 2 million meters of linen for industrial departments. At the same time, expanding purchases, increasing orders of 100 billion yuan for the region's industrial production and stockpiled commodities, to ensure the overfulfillment of the purchasing and sales plans.

During the process of formulating plans to increase production and practice economy, these two units repeatedly conducted ideological education for their employees, clarified the direction, and unified their thinking, so their actions were relatively rapid. When they began to mobilize to increase production and practice economy, some erroneous ideas were exposed among the employees. A relatively common one was not knowing where the commercial departments could increase production and practice economy from. Some people regarded increasing production and practicing economy as "passive saving"; some departments wanted to streamline sick and incompetent cadres; some people separated increasing production and practicing economy from current work and wanted to formulate separate plans. After discovering these erroneous ideas, the leadership immediately pointed out that increasing production and practicing economy was consistent with current work, and that the main focus of increasing production and practicing economy in commercial departments was to realize expanded commodity circulation plans. At the same time, through repeated study of relevant documents and newspaper editorials, understanding gradually improved. People who originally planned to "take spare parts and spend money before increasing production and practicing economy" also changed their attitude and concentrated their efforts on studying the conditions for expanding commodity circulation plans.

In the process of discussing and formulating plans, a conservative idea of "ordering fewer plans and overfulfilling more" emerged. For example, when discussing increasing the supply plan within the customs, some employees believed that it could be increased more based on the expanded market situation within the customs this year. For example, one place in Guangzhou could supply an additional 10,000 boxes of glass. However, Hu Qingru, who was in charge of glass, believed that only 2,000 boxes could be sold and insisted on making the plan smaller. The next day, it happened that someone from the Guangzhou station came and proposed a plan to purchase 20,000 boxes of glass, which strongly countered the conservative thinking. Therefore, the leadership used this as a typical example and criticized it at the general meeting of all employees. After the meeting, Hu Qingru's thinking changed, and he and another comrade in charge of glass studied the market situation within the customs, increasing the original plan of importing 120,000 more boxes of glass to importing 150,000 more boxes. A high tide of "studying production and sales situations, finding methods, and formulating advanced plans" was set off among the employees. Staff in charge of cotton cloth studied the characteristics of linen, and technicians tested dyeing and processing various backpacks, etc. After clarifying these situations and conditions, they were confident in proposing a plan to promote the sale of 2 million meters of linen.

Some departments do not directly control commodity purchasing and sales work. Their plans to increase production and practice economy are centered on inspecting, supervising, and ensuring the realization of the expanded purchasing and sales plans, rather than simply calculating the savings figures within the scope of the department. For example, the financial accounting department focuses on leveraging the effectiveness of funds, earnestly strengthening settlement work, and ensuring that goods, accounts, and money are consistent. The storage and transportation department must vigorously organize vehicle and ship transportation, seize the opportunity for transit, reduce the level of vehicle allocation, eliminate loading and unloading accidents, overcome waiting for transportation and detention phenomena, and reduce losses and expenses. The plans of each department are proposed to ensure the overfulfillment of the purchasing and sales plans. In addition, in terms of saving on administrative expenses, a plan was proposed to save 77 million yuan in office expenses and funding expenditures.

Currently, the employees of the Northeast China Department Store Company and the Shenyang Purchasing and Supply Station have already begun to take action. Some comrades have gone deep into various factories to understand the industrial production situation. After contacting the Machinery No. 9 Factory, they will increase the order for bicycles that exceeds the plan. Some employees went to key wholesale stations to understand the inventory situation and prepared to hold a region-wide internal exchange meeting in mid-October to conduct inventory adjustment work. The sales teams sent to Central South, North China, Northwest and other places are also about to depart. The overall goal of the employees is clear, so their morale is high. The party and trade union organizations of these two units are working to mobilize the masses to launch a competition based on the already established plans to increase production and practice economy, in order to guarantee the overfulfillment of the plans.

### 中国百货公司东北区公司等单位  发动竞赛保证超额完成购销计划

    中国百货公司东北区公司等单位
    发动竞赛保证超额完成购销计划
    中国百货公司东北区公司和沈阳采购供应站已发动全体职工，努力增产节约，讨论出购销计划，现正发动竞赛，保证超额完成购销计划。
    中国百货公司东北区公司和沈阳采购供应站的购销计划，是在扩大商品流转的思想基础上制订出来的。这两个单位，根据他们的业务特点，提出了：扩大关内供应计划一千三百亿元，区内推销一千亿元的库存商品，换回资金来购进新商品，为工业部门解决二百万公尺亚麻布的销路。与此同时，扩大进货，对区内工业增产和积压商品增加订货一千亿元，以保证超额完成购销计划。
    这两个单位在制订增产节约计划的过程中，反复对职工进行思想教育，明确方向、统一思想，所以行动比较迅速。开始动员增产节约的时候，职工中曾暴露了一些错误思想，其中较普遍的是不知道商业部门从哪里来增产节约，有人把增产节约看成“消极节省”；有的科要精减有病的和能力差的干部；有人把增产节约和当前工作分开，要分别订计划。在发现这些错误思想后，领导上当即指出：增产节约和当前工作是一致的，商业部门的增产节约主要在于实现扩大的商品流转计划。同时，反复学习有关文件和报纸社论，认识逐渐提高。原来打算“趁着没增产节约，先领备品、花出钱去”的人，也改变了态度，集中力量研究扩大商品流转计划的条件了。
    在讨论制订计划的过程中，曾出现了“少订计划多超额”的保守思想。譬如讨论增加关内供应计划时，有的职工根据今年关内市场扩大的情况，认为可以多增加一些，如广州一个地方能够多供应一万箱玻璃。但是主管玻璃的胡庆儒却认为只能销两千箱，一定要把计划订得小一些。第二天碰巧广州站来了人，提出要玻璃两万箱的计划，有力地打击了保守思想。于是，领导上以此作为典型，在全体职工大会上进行了批判。会后，胡庆儒思想有了转变，和另一个主管玻璃的同志研究了关内市场情况，从原来规定多进关十二万箱玻璃增到多进十五万箱。在职工中掀起了“研究产销情况、找办法、订先进计划”的高潮。主管纱布的职员研究了亚麻布的特点，技术人员试验染色、加工各种背包等。在弄清楚了这些情况和条件后，就有把握提出推销二百万公尺亚麻布的计划。
    有些科室是不直接掌握商品购销工作的。他们的增产节约计划就以检查、督促和保证扩大了的购销计划地实现为中心，不单纯的计算科室范围内的节约数字。譬如财务会计部门是以发挥资金效能为中心，切实的加强结算工作，作到货、账、钱相符。储运部门要大力组织车船运输，抓紧中转，缩低配车等级，消灭装卸车事故，克服待运停留现象，降低损耗和费用。各科室的计划都是从保证超额完成购销计划而提出的。此外，在机关节约开支方面，提出了节约办公费和经费开支七千七百万元的计划。
    目前，中国百货公司东北区公司和沈阳采购供应站的职工已经开始行动起来，部分同志深入各厂去了解工业增产情况，经和机械九厂联系后，将超过计划增加一部分自行车的订货；部分职工到重点批发站去了解库存后，准备在十月中召开一次全区规模的内部交流会，进行库存调剂工作。派往中南、华北、西北等地的推销组也即将出发。全体职工的努力目标明确，所以情绪饱满。这两个单位的党和工会组织正着手发动群众，在已订增产节约计划的基础上开展竞赛，以保证计划的超额完成。
