    Central South Region Provinces Emphasize Production Materials Supply Work
    To strive for a bumper late autumn harvest and prepare for wheat planting, the provinces of the Central South Region are paying close attention to the preparation and supply of production materials.
    Henan Province has widely mobilized the masses to carry out a manure accumulation campaign, achieving great results. At the same time, the government has prepared 16,113,000 jin of various commercial fertilizers, arranged for loans to households for timely use. To dispel the masses' concerns about wheat not germinating after frost, 72 wheat varieties were selected, and more than 54 tests were conducted by the Agricultural College of Henan University, the Henan Agricultural Experiment Station, and 32 units of special zone and county farms. The results showed good germination rates, strengthening the masses' confidence in wheat planting. The government has also allocated 190 billion yuan in wheat seed loans to solve the difficulties of the masses in areas with poor wheat harvests and flood-stricken areas, such as wheat seeds, fertilizers, farm tools, and draught animals. In Hunan Province, some farmers lacked seeds, labor, and farm tools during autumn plowing and planting, which were mostly resolved through mutual aid. For example, in Fuyong Township, Seventh District, Hengyang, 70 out of 456 households lacked labor and could not carry out autumn planting. The township leadership mobilized the masses to help solve the problem through exchange of labor, contracted labor, and exchange of labor with cattle. The Jiangxi Provincial Finance and Economics Committee held an emergency meeting, deciding to coordinate with autumn and winter planting to do a good job in seed supply. The bank and the Cooperative Business Administration have instructed their subordinates to cooperate with autumn planting and prepare for winter planting, issuing relevant loans and supplying seeds, fertilizers, farm tools, and other work. In many areas of Guangxi, there is a shortage of labor, seeds, and fertilizers. The Guilin Special Zone alone is short of 500,000 jin of buckwheat seeds, and there was a rush to purchase them. After a study by the special zone cadre meeting, it was emphasized that each county should rely on its own efforts, which has been basically resolved.

    中南区各省重视生产资料供应工作
    中南区各省为了争取晚秋作物丰收，并为种麦作好准备，对于生产资料的准备与供应工作，都很重视。
    河南省普遍发动群众，开展积肥运动，取得了很大的成绩。同时，政府还准备好各种商品肥料一千六百十一万三千斤，布置贷放到户，以便及时使用。为了解除群众怕霜后小麦不能发芽的顾虑，将霜后小麦选择了七十二个品种，由河南大学农学院、河南省农事试验场及专区、县农场三十二个单位，进行了五十四次以上的试验，结果发芽率良好，坚定了群众的种麦信心。政府又拨发麦种贷款一千九百亿元，以解决小麦歉收区及水灾区的群众麦种、肥料、农具、耕畜等困难。湖南省在秋耕秋种中，有些农户缺乏种子、劳动力和农具，大都通过互助互济获得了解决。如衡阳七区伏永乡四百五十六户中，有七十户缺乏劳力，不能秋种，该乡领导上动员群众，以兑工、包工、人牛换工等方式帮助解决。江西省财政经济委员会举行紧急会议，决定配合秋种冬种作好种子供应工作。银行、合作事业管理局已分别指示所属，配合秋种，准备冬种，发放有关贷款及供应种子、肥料、农具等工作。广西不少地区缺乏劳动力及种子肥料，仅桂林专区即缺荞麦种子五十万斤，曾发生抢购现象，经专区干部会研究，强调各县自力更生，已基本上得到解决。
