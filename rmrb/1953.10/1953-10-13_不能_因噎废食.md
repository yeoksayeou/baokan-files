Don't "Stop Eating Because of Choking"
		Dong Kekuan

Recently, I heard a comrade returning from inspecting work in the countryside talk about the following situation: Some comrades working in rural areas, in order to overcome the phenomenon of "five excesses" (excessive meetings, documents, organizations, concurrent jobs, and activities), pay close attention to "fewer meetings" and "shorter meetings." Therefore, when meetings are held, they cover: first, drought prevention and resistance, autumn protection and soil moisture preservation; second, autumn harvesting and planting; third, rectifying mutual aid teams; fourth... This simple explanation is considered work deployment, but the reasons for doing so and how to do it are not mentioned at all. The meeting does end quickly, but its effectiveness is questionable.

The phenomenon of "meetings every day" and "meetings that never end" did affect production and aroused public dissatisfaction in the past. Therefore, "fewer meetings" and "shorter meetings" are everyone's urgent demands. But how exactly should we reduce them? And how should we shorten them? In the eyes of some comrades, it seems that the only way is to cram many things into one meeting and deploy them all at once; but with more tasks piled up, the meeting is bound to be prolonged. Thus, another "clever" "method" is to "talk less" and "make long stories short," sacrificing everything to "save" even the things that must be said, reducing them to the extent of point one, point two, point three. As a result, the masses only know that there is a certain work project, but do not know its specific content. Just think, in this situation, how can the masses exert their strength, and how can we ensure the completion of work tasks?

The purpose of our meetings is not only to make the masses aware of the work to be done currently, but more importantly, to let everyone know the reasons why we are doing it and how to do it. Because only in this way can we fully mobilize the masses and educate them. However, some of our comrades, in order to "hold fewer meetings" and "hold shorter meetings," have neglected the purpose of holding meetings.

"Fewer meetings" does not mean no meetings at all; those that should be held must be resolutely held. "Shorter meetings" does not mean that we can do less or no publicity work, but rather requires us to proceed from reality, to solve the ideological problems of the masses more pertinently and practically, to improve the masses, and to promote our work. While resolutely correcting unrealistic "long and tedious speeches," we must earnestly pay attention to the political and ideological education and propaganda mobilization work of the masses. We cannot "stop eating because of choking."

    不能“因噎废食”
    董克宽
    最近，我听到一位从农村检查工作回来的同志谈到这样一种情况：有些在农村工作的同志为了克服“五多”现象，非常注意“少开会”“开短会”。因此，开起会来，就是：一是防旱抗旱、保秋保墒，二是秋收秋播，三是整顿互助组，四是……。这样简单一说，就算布置了工作，究竟为什么要这样做，如何做法，却只字不提。会议倒是很快结束了，但效果如何，可就值得怀疑了。
    “无日不会”“无会不长”的现象，过去在农村的确影响了生产，引起群众不满。因之，“少开会”、“开短会”，是大家的迫切要求。但究竟怎样少？如何短法呢？在有些同志看来，好像唯一的办法，就是把好多事情向一个会议上挤，一次布置；但任务堆的多了，势必要把会议拖长，于是另一个“巧妙”的“办法”，就是“少说话”、“长话短叙”，不惜一切，把非说不可的话，硬“节省”掉，直省到一条、二条、三条的程度。结果使群众仅仅知道有一个什么工作项目，而不知道它的具体内容。试想一想，在这种情况下，怎样能使群众发挥力量，又怎样能保证工作任务完成呢？
    我们开会的目的，不但是要使群众知道目前要做的工作，更重要的是还要让大家知道为什么要这样做和怎样做的道理。因为只有这样，才能充分发动群众，教育群众。但是，我们有的同志为了要“少开会”“开短会”，而竟忽略了开会的目的。
    “少开会”，不是不开会，应当开的坚决要开；“开短会”，并不意味着可以不做或少做宣传工作，而是要求从实际出发：更中肯、更实际地解决群众思想问题，提高群众，推进我们的工作。我们在坚决纠正不切合实际的“熬油讲演”的同时，要切实重视对群众的政治思想教育和宣传鼓动工作，我们不能“因噎废食”。
