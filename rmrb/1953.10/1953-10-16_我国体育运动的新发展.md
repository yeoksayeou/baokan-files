    New Developments in China's Sports Movement
    Zhang Qihua
    (I)
    The tremendous achievements of the "1953 National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Championships" held in the capital from October 2nd to 7th are unprecedented in the history of China's sports movement. It marks a new stage in the development of China's sports movement and foreshadows even greater development of China's sports cause in the future, to the extent that it will be able to gradually reach the world's advanced level within a certain period.
    This大会 is the first National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Championships since the founding of New China, and the gymnastics competition is the first in China's history. The foundation of China's track and field, gymnastics, and cycling movements was very weak in the past, but the results of this大会 fully demonstrate the great achievements China has made in carrying out track and field, gymnastics, and cycling movements in the four years since liberation. In the thirty-four track and field events held at the大会, a total of nineteen track and field events (including ten for men and nine for women) created new national records. The gymnastics competition shows that China's relatively backward gymnastics movement has also made considerable progress. A. Polezhayev, the coach of the Soviet sports delegation's women's team who visited China, praised China's female gymnasts after watching the gymnastics competition at the大会. The men's and women's cycling competitions at various distances also created excellent results. People are extremely excited about the great achievements of this大会 and the magnificent prospects of the motherland's sports cause.
    In the short four years since the founding of New China, on the very weak foundation left over from old China, China's track and field, gymnastics, and cycling movements have already achieved such great development and created such outstanding results; then, in the future, under the cultivation of the Party and the People's Government, and with the active efforts of all sports workers and athletes, China's sports cause will undoubtedly achieve even greater success. Leaving aside the time before liberation, even after liberation, some people once believed that the sports movement of the Chinese people could not achieve a high level of development and would never catch up with the world level. These people did not understand the brave and hardworking qualities of the Chinese people with their unlimited wisdom, did not understand the superiority of the people's democratic system, and did not understand the great power of the policies of the Party and the People's Government. Their erroneous arguments have been shattered by the outstanding achievements of this大会. After a considerable period of effort, China's sports cause will surely catch up with and reach the world's advanced level. The time it takes will be shorter than we expected.
    (II)
    Although track and field运动 has a history of several decades in China, due to the reactionary rule of old China, the sports movement could not take root among the broad masses of the people, so the development of track and field 运动 in China was extremely slow, and the level of track and field 运动 was very low. Even these low-level records were often maintained for many years, even ten or twenty years, and could not be broken. This was the backward state of track and field 运动 in China before.
    After liberation, the initial results of China's carrying out track and field 运动 have been fully demonstrated at this大会. From this大会, we not only saw the achievement of breaking the national record in more than half of the track and field events, but also saw that China's track and field 运动 has a huge potential force to guarantee the long-term development of track and field 运动.
    First, in the sports meets held in various places after liberation, nearly ten men's and women's track and field events have already created new national records. At this大会, not only have these records almost all been broken, but also many records that have been maintained in China for ten or even twenty years, and have not been broken for such a long time in old China, have been broken. For example, the national record for the men's 1,500 meters, which has been maintained for seventeen years since 1936; the national records for the men's 200-meter low hurdles, women's javelin, women's 100 meters and 200 meters, which have been maintained for eighteen years since 1935; the national records for the men's long jump, 1,600-meter relay, and women's 400-meter relay, which have been continuously maintained for twenty years since 1933, have all been broken at this大会. And these achievements were only obtained in the short four years, and under the condition that the track and field运动 was not carried out widely enough. It can be imagined that in the process of extensively carrying out mass sports activities in the future, more tremendous achievements will continue to be created.
    Second, at this sports大会, it is no longer one or two athletes who are breaking records and creating records, but a batch of athletes. In the competition, a total of twenty-seven outstanding male and female athletes broke fifteen field and track records, and nine male and female relay teams broke four relay records. Among them, Liu Yuying, a player from the Northeast Region, created new national records for the women's 100-meter and 200-meter events; Shi Qin, a player from the People's Liberation Army, broke the national records for the men's 800-meter and 1,500-meter events; Li Qi, a player from the East China Region, broke the national records for the men's 1,500-meter and 5,000-meter events; Yang Yizhuang, a player from the People's Liberation Army, broke the national records for the women's javelin and grenade throwing events. The men's teams from the People's Liberation Army and the Northeast Region both broke the national records for the 1,600-meter relay and the 1,500-meter medley relay events.
    Not only have many sports events broken national records, but in many sports events, it is not only the first place that has broken the record, but also the second place, third place, and even the top four have broken the record. The top two in the women's shot put, women's javelin, and men's 1,600-meter relay all broke the national record. The items in which the top three all broke the national record include: men's 1,500 meters, 5,000 meters, 200-meter low hurdles, 1,500-meter medley relay, men's grenade throwing, and women's grenade throwing. The top four in the women's 400-meter relay all broke the national record; and in the women's 800 meters, not only did the top four break the record, but the fifth place outside the ranking of the大会 also broke the national record (the大会 has given this athlete, Li Shaofang, a player from the People's Liberation Army, an honorary award). In particular, the breaking of national records in many relay events is most sufficient to illustrate the achievements of our track and field运动. In addition, in many sports events, some winners' scores, although they did not break the record, reached the national record or were close to the national record. These are all worthy of attention.
    The fifty-eight outstanding male and female athletes (including those who broke the national record in individual events and relay events) who stood at the front of the athletes' team at the closing ceremony of the大会 used facts to illustrate the rapid progress of China's track and field 运动; their achievements illustrate that China's track and field 运动 has a certain mass base. Gradually improve on this basis, and I believe that China's track and field 运动 will achieve more brilliant and greater achievements.
    Third, many of the outstanding athletes who broke records are new participants in track and field 运动. They have not practiced for a long time, but they have already achieved such remarkable results. In particular, judging from the fact that their personal records are constantly improving, we firmly believe that their development prospects are unlimited. For example, Gao Shugui, the creator of the new national record for the men's long jump and a car driver of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. When the Fujian Military Region held a sports meet in August 1952, his long jump score was 6 meters; when he participated in the East China Military Region track and field trials in April this year, he had jumped to 6.40 meters; in July, when he participated in the People's Liberation Army track and field trials in Beijing, his score rose to 6.60 meters; at this大会, he broke the men's long jump national record, which had been maintained for a full twenty years, with an excellent score of 6.93 meters. Liu Zheng, the champion of the women's 80-meter low hurdles and the creator of the new national record, a player from the North China Region, is a staff member of the Gui Sui Posts and Telecommunications Administration. At the Gui Sui City Sports大会 in 1951, her low hurdle score was 16 seconds; at the Gui Sui City Sports大会 on National Day in 1952, her score had improved to 15.1 seconds; at the North China Region Sports大会 in August this year, her score improved to 13.9 seconds; at this大会, she created a new national record of 12.6 seconds. Luo Yunqi, the creator of the new national record for the women's shot put and a player from the People's Liberation Army, has not participated in track and field training for a long time. When she participated in the Sichuan Provincial Sports大会 in Chengdu in February this year, her shot put score was 10.345 meters; when she participated in the National Track and Field Trials in Beijing in May, her score rose to 10.89 meters; when she participated in the People's Liberation Army Track and Field Trials in July, she improved to 11.44 meters; at this大会, she created a new national record with a score of 12.19 meters. Shi Baozhu, the runner-up in the women's shot put at the大会, a sixteen-year-old student at the Dalian Medical School from the Northeast Region, had a shot put score of 10.46 meters at the "May Fourth" Sports Meet held in the Northeast Region in May. At this大会, he also broke the national record with a score of 11.82 meters. Liu Chengbang, the creator of the new national record for the men's grenade throwing, a twenty-one-year-old railway player, is a weigher at the Yucheng Station of the Jinan Railway Bureau. During the period of concentrated training after the National Railway Sports大会 in March this year, his grenade only threw 52.88 meters, and later improved to more than 64 meters. At this大会, he created the highest national record of 68.90 meters.
    There are many more examples like this. This all proves that the track and field athletes who participated in this大会 and many other athletes are still making leaps and bounds in their scores. These all clearly show that the development and improvement of our track and field运动 has great potential.
    Fourth, judging from the situation of many athletes who broke national records and created new national records at this大会, we believe that they still have great potential and their scores will continue to improve. This is not only because they are still new participants in sports activities, and their scores are still in a stage of rapid development, but also because they still have many areas in their sports techniques that can be improved. We know that among those athletes who participated in the大会 and achieved excellent results, although many have received good coaching guidance, their sports techniques still have some shortcomings; some athletes have not yet undergone scientific training methods. If they can further receive the guidance of scientific training methods, their scores can continue to improve. From this, we can see how great the responsibility of our sports workers is. Our sports workers must strive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, diligently study scientific sports guidance techniques, carry forward a high degree of patriotism, carefully study the conditions and characteristics of athletes, and responsibly carry out scientific guidance. Only in this way can the development of China's track and field 运动 and the improvement of scores be better guaranteed.
    Of course, the fundamental reasons that promote the continuous development of China's sports movement and the continuous improvement of scores are the superiority of the people's democratic system, the tireless care of the Party and the People's Government for the people's sports cause, and the continuous improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the people. Because without these, our sports cause will be lifeless, and its development and progress will be unimaginable.
    (III)
    Gymnastics 运动 has not been promoted in China for a long time. It lags behind sports such as ball games, track and field, and swimming, and its foundation is the weakest. Therefore, at this大会, there were only competitions for men's and women's free exercises, men's parallel bars, women's uneven bars, and men's and women's vaulting horse. And men's rings, pommel horse, and women's high and low bars, and balance beam were not included in the competition items. At the same time, the prescribed movements formulated by the大会 are also relatively simple and easy to perform. However, this gymnastics competition proves that China has made great achievements in promoting gymnastics 运动 since liberation. Athletes from various units and regions have not only done very well in the prescribed movements, but also in the optional movements of various gymnastics events, they have been able to make many movements with higher difficulty, such as the forward wheel, reverse wheel and exchange, handstand push-down, and somersault dismount in the men's horizontal bar; the leg up from the middle of the bar, straight arm slow rise to handstand, handstand quick turn, release and re-grip, and arm stand horizontal in the parallel bars, the long swing leg up, hanging arm back circle, and handstand in the women's uneven bars; and the straight body back somersault and back handspring, and soft somersault in the men's and women's free exercises. It is worth pointing out that many units' athletes have practiced gymnastics for a very short time, and even only practiced for a few months before participating in the competition, but their results are also very good, which is an extremely gratifying phenomenon. But our gymnastics training also has shortcomings. It can be seen from this gymnastics competition that although many athletes pay attention to apparatus gymnastics such as horizontal bars and parallel bars, they neglect the training of free exercises, which is the foundation of gymnastics 运动; in competitions and training, they pay more attention to optional movements, but do not pay enough attention to prescribed movements and do them poorly; in the organization of optional movements, they pay attention to movements with high difficulty and neglect the organic and natural connection between movements; in free exercises, they pay more attention to movements such as handstand, balance, and handspring, but do not pay attention to the most basic movements in free exercises, so that the posture is not very correct, which weakens the training effect.
    Before and after this大会, and at the venue of the大会, the Soviet sports delegation made many outstanding performances with their highest level of gymnastics skills in succession. From these exemplary performances, China's sports workers and athletes not only learned the scientific training methods of gymnastics, but also further clarified the direction of development of gymnastics 运动.
    The gymnastics competition of this大会 will become a good start for the continuous upward development of China's gymnastics 运动 and gradually catching up with the world's advanced level. We should continue to work hard on this good foundation.
    (IV)
    The great harvest of the "1953 National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Championships" is the victory of China's sports cause, which marks a new development in China's sports movement. Our country is a country full of vigor and vitality, and all kinds of construction undertakings are advancing by leaps and bounds; our sports cause will certainly continue to progress along with the development of the country's economic and cultural undertakings. Now, China has entered a new historical period of gradually transitioning to a socialist society, and 1953 is the first year that China began to implement large-scale planned economic construction. Extremely arduous and glorious tasks are placed before the people of the whole country. We must have a strong and healthy body, and have steel-like nerves and muscles to meet this solemn task. The sports workers and athletes of the whole country should strive to consolidate the achievements already made at this大会, continue to improve their political level and professional level, realize Chairman Mao's great call of "developing sports and strengthening the people's physique," and further encourage and promote more people to participate in sports, exercise, improve their health level, and play a greater role in the cause of building the motherland and defending peace.

    我国体育运动的新发展
    张其华
    （一）
    十月二日至七日在首都举行的“一九五三年全国田径、体操、自行车运动大会”所获得的巨大成就，在我国体育运动的历史上是空前的。它标志着我国体育运动发展的新阶段，它预示着我国体育运动事业在今后将获得更大的发展，以至完全能够在一定时期内逐步达到世界先进水平。
    这次大会是新中国成立以来第一次全国田径、体操、自行车运动大会，而体操比赛更是我国历史上的第一次。我国田径、体操和自行车运动的基础在过去都是很薄弱的，而这次大会比赛的成绩，却充分地显示出解放四年来我国开展田径、体操和自行车运动所获得的巨大成就。在大会举行的三十四项田径比赛中，共有十九项（其中男子有十项、女子有九项）田径运动创造了新的全国最高纪录。体操比赛的情况表明，我国原来比较落后的体操运动也已有了长足的进步。来我国访问的苏联体育代表团女子队教练阿·波列热耶夫在参观了大会体操比赛后，曾对我国女子体操选手加以赞扬。大会的男子和女子的各种距离的自行车比赛也都创造了优异的成绩。人们为这次大会所获得的巨大成就以及祖国体育运动事业的壮丽远景感到极大的振奋。
    在新中国成立以来的短短的四年中，在旧中国所遗留下的很薄弱的基础上，我国的田径、体操以及自行车运动既已得到了这样巨大的发展，创造出这样卓越的成绩；那么，今后在党和人民政府的培育下，在全体体育工作者和运动员的积极努力下，我国体育运动事业无疑会获得更大的成就。撇开解放以前不说，甚至在解放以后，还曾经有人认为我国人民的体育运动不能获得高度的发展，永远追不上世界水平。这些人不理解具有无限智慧的我国人民的勇敢、勤劳的优秀品质，不理解人民民主制度的优越性，不理解党和人民政府政策的巨大力量，他们的错误论点已被这次大会的卓越成绩击破了。我国体育运动事业经过相当时期的努力，一定会赶上和达到世界先进水平。它所需要的时间，将会比我们所预料的短些。
    （二）
    田径运动在我国虽已有了数十年的历史，但由于旧中国的反动统治，体育运动不能在广大群众中生根结实，所以我国田径运动的发展是极为缓慢的，田径运动的水平是很低下的，即使这种低下水平的纪录也常是保持好几年甚至一二十年而不能被打破。这就是以前我国田径运动的落后状况。
    解放后，我国开展田径运动的初步结果，已经在这次大会上充分表现出来。我们从这次大会不仅看到有过半数的田径比赛项目打破了全国最高纪录这样的成就，而且看到我国田径运动有着巨大的潜在力量，足以保证田径运动的长足发展。
    第一，解放后，在各地举行的运动会上，即已有近十项男女田径运动项目创造了新的全国纪录。在这次大会上，不仅这些纪录已几乎全部被刷新了，并且还打破了不少在我国已保持了十年乃至二十年之久、在旧中国那么长的时期里始终未被打破的纪录。如从一九三六年起保持了十七年的男子一千五百公尺的全国纪录；从一九三五年起保持了十八年的男子二百公尺低栏、女子标枪、女子一百公尺和二百公尺的全国纪录；从一九三三年起连续保持了二十年的男子跳远、一千六百公尺接力、女子四百公尺接力的全国纪录，在这次大会上都一一被打破了。而这些成绩，还只是在短短的四年内、在田径运动开展得还不够广泛的情况下获得的。可以想见，在今后广泛地开展群众性的体育运动的过程中，定会有更巨大的成绩不断地被创造出来。
    第二，在这次运动大会上，打破纪录和创造纪录的已经不是一两个运动员，而是成批的运动员了。在比赛中，共有男女优秀运动员二十七人打破了十五项田赛和径赛纪录，九个男女接力代表队打破了四项接力赛纪录。其中东北区选手刘玉英创造了女子一百公尺和二百公尺两项运动的全国新纪录；解放军选手石勤打破了男子八百公尺和一千五百公尺两项运动的全国纪录；华东区选手李琦打破了男子一千五百公尺和五千公尺的两项运动的全国纪录；解放军选手杨一庄打破了女子标枪和掷手榴弹两项运动的全国纪录。解放军和东北区的男子代表队，都打破了一千六百公尺接力和一千五百公尺异程接力的两项运动的全国纪录。
    不仅许多运动项目打破了全国纪录，而且在许多运动项目中打破纪录的还不只是第一名，而第二名、第三名以至前四名都打破了纪录。女子铅球、女子标枪和男子一千六百公尺接力都是前两名打破全国纪录。前三名一起都打破全国纪录的项目计有：男子一千五百公尺、五千公尺、二百公尺低栏、一千五百公尺异程接力、男子掷手榴弹和女子掷手榴弹。女子四百公尺接力前四名都打破了全国纪录；而女子八百公尺则不但前四名都打破了纪录，就是大会录取名次之外的第五名也打破了全国纪录（大会已对这位运动员——解放军选手李少芳给以荣誉奖）。特别是很多接力项目打破全国纪录，最足以说明我们田径运动开展的成绩。另外，在许多项目中，有些优胜者的成绩虽然没有打破纪录，但却达到了全国纪录或已接近全国纪录。这些都是值得重视的。
    在大会闭幕式上站在运动员队伍前列的五十八名（包括个人项目和接力项目打破全国纪录者）男女优秀运动员，用事实说明了我国田径运动的飞跃进步；他们的成绩，说明了我国田径运动已具有了一定的群众基础。在这个基础上逐步提高，相信我国田径运动将会取得更光辉、更巨大的成就。
    第三，打破纪录的优秀的运动员，许多都是田径运动的新的参加者，他们练习的时间都不算长，而他们就已有了这样卓越的成绩。特别是从他们的个人纪录在不断提高这一情况看，我们深信，他们的发展前途是不可限量的。例如男子跳远新的全国纪录的创造者、解放军选手高树贵，是解放军某部汽车司机员。一九五二年八月福建军区举行运动会时，他的跳远成绩是六公尺；到今年四月参加华东军区田径选拔赛时，他已跳到六公尺四十公分；七月，在北京参加解放军全军田径选拔赛时，成绩又升到六公尺六十公分；在这次大会上，他又以六公尺九十三公分的优越成绩，打破了已经保持整整二十年的男子跳远全国纪录。大会女子八十公尺低栏冠军、新的全国纪录的创造者、华北区选手刘正，是归绥邮电管理局的工作人员。一九五一年归绥市运动大会时，她的低栏成绩是十六秒；一九五二年国庆节归绥市运动大会时，她的成绩已提高到十五秒一；今年八月华北区运动大会时，成绩又提高到十三秒九；在这次大会上，她创造了十二秒六的全国新纪录。女子铅球新的全国纪录的创造者、解放军选手罗运琪，她参加田径锻炼的时间并不久，今年二月她在成都参加四川省运动会时，推铅球的成绩是十公尺三十四公分五；五月她在北京参加全国田径选拔大会时，成绩升到十公尺八十九公分；七月参加解放军全军田径选拔时，又提高到十一公尺四十四公分；在这次大会上，她又以十二公尺十九公分的成绩创造了全国新纪录。大会女子铅球亚军、东北区选手、大连医士学校十六岁的学生石宝珠，在五月间东北区举行的“五四”运动会上，推铅球成绩是十公尺四十六公分，在这次大会上他也以十一公尺八十二公分的成绩打破了全国纪录。男子手榴弹新的全国纪录的创造者、铁路选手、二十一岁的刘成邦，是济南铁路局禹城站的司磅员。他在今年三月全国铁路运动大会以后集中训练的期间内，手榴弹只掷五十二公尺八十八公分，后来提高到六十四公尺多，这次大会上他创造了六十八公尺九十公分的全国最高纪录。
    像这样的例子还很多。这都证明了参加这次大会的田径运动员以及其它许许多多的运动员，他们的成绩都还在飞跃地进步着。这些都很清楚地说明了我们的田径运动的发展和成绩的提高是有着极大的可能性的。
    第四，从这次大会许多打破全国纪录和创造新的全国纪录的运动员的情况来看，我们认为，他们还蕴藏着极大的潜力，他们的成绩将会继续提高。这不仅是由于他们还都是体育运动的新的参加者，他们的成绩还处在飞跃发展的阶段，同时，还因为他们在运动技术上还存有许多可以改进的地方。我们知道，在那些参加大会并获得优越成绩的运动员中，虽有许多是经过了良好的教练指导的，但他们的运动技术也还有若干缺点；有些运动员就还没有经过科学方法的锻炼。如果他们能够进一步地得到科学的锻炼方法的指导，他们的成绩便能够继续不断地提高。这里可以看出我国体育工作者的责任是如何重大。我们的体育工作者，必须努力学习苏联先进经验，认真钻研科学的运动指导技术，发扬高度的爱国主义精神，认真地研究运动员的条件和特点，负责地进行科学的指导。只有这样，我国田径运动的发展和成绩的提高才能得到更好的保证。
    当然，促使我国体育运动的不断发展和成绩的不断提高的根本原因，乃是人民民主制度的优越性，乃是党和人民政府对人民体育事业的不倦关怀，乃是人民群众的物质生活和文化生活水平的不断提高。因为离开了这些，我们的体育运动事业将是无生命的，它的发展和进步将是不可想像的。
    （三）
    体操运动在我国推行不久，它落后于球类、田径、游泳等项体育运动，基础也是最为薄弱的。因此，在这次大会上还只有男、女自由体操，男子单、双杠，女子双杠和男、女跳箱的比赛。而男子吊环、鞍马和女子高低杠、平衡木都没有列入比赛项目。同时，大会制定的各项规定动作也是比较简单易行的。可是，这次体操比赛证明，我国在解放后推行体操运动已有了很大的成绩。各单位各地区的运动员不仅是规定动作已经做得很好，并且在各项体操的自选动作中，已能做出许多难度较高的动作，如男子单杠的正车轮、反车轮及互换、倒立推下、挺身脱手回环等；双杠中的杠中反蹬足上、直臂慢起倒立、倒立快转身、脱手再握、臂立水平等，女子双杠中的长振蹬足上、挂臂后回环、手倒立等；男子和女子自由体操中的直体后腾空翻和后手翻、软翻等。值得指出：有许多单位的运动员练习体操的时间是很短的，甚至还只练习了几个月就参加了比赛，但他们的成绩也很优良，这是极为可喜的现象。但是我们的体操锻炼也是有缺点的。在这次体操比赛中可以看出：许多运动员虽注意单杠、双杠等器械体操，但却忽视了作为体操运动的基础的徒手体操的锻炼；在比赛中以及锻炼中对自选动作比较认真，而对规定动作注意得不够，做得较差；在自选动作的组织上注意了难度高的动作而忽视了动作和动作间的有机的、自然的连接；在自由体操中对倒立、平衡以及手翻等动作比较注意，而对徒手体操中的最基本动作不加注意，以至姿势不很正确，减弱了锻炼效果。
    在这次大会前后以及在大会会场上，苏联体育代表团以他们的最高水准的体操技巧连续做了多次的卓越的表演。从这些典范的表演中，我国的体育工作者和运动员，不仅学到了体操的科学锻炼方法，而且进一步明确认识了体操运动的发展方向。
    这次大会的体操比赛将成为我国体操运动不断向上发展以至逐步赶上世界先进水平的良好的开端。我们应该在这个良好的基础上继续努力。
    （四）
    “一九五三年全国田径、体操、自行车运动大会”的巨大收获，是我国体育运动事业的胜利，它标志着我国体育运动的新的发展。我们的国家，是朝气蓬勃、各种建设事业都在飞跃前进的国家；我们的体育运动事业，也一定能够随着国家经济、文化事业的发展而不断地进步。现在，我国进入了逐步过渡到社会主义社会的新的历史时期，一九五三年正是我国开始实施有计划的大规模的经济建设的第一个年度。在全国人民面前摆着极其艰巨而光荣的任务，我们必须具有坚强的健康的身体，具有钢铁一般的神经和筋肉来迎接这个庄严的任务。全国的体育工作者和运动员应该努力巩固这次大会既得的成绩，继续不断提高政治水平和业务水平，实现毛主席的“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的伟大号召，进一步鼓舞和推动更多的人民群众参加体育运动，锻炼身体，提高健康水平，在建设祖国和保卫和平事业中，发挥更大的力量。
