German Democratic Republic Established Four Years Ago

    October 7th marks the fourth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. The German Democratic Republic was born from the unwavering will of the German people. The German people could not tolerate the division of Germany created by American imperialism and were determined to establish a unified, democratic, independent, and peace-loving Germany in the heart of Europe. Such a Germany, allied with the great Soviet Union, is the most reliable guarantee for defending peace in Europe.

    The German Democratic Republic has grown up on the basis of democratic reforms. These democratic reforms have been carried out in the Soviet-occupied eastern part of Germany since 1945. In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, Nazism and militarism were eliminated in this part of Germany; the land of the Junker landlords was confiscated and distributed to the working peasants; the enterprises of the monopoly capitalists were confiscated and became the property of the whole people; democratic administrative organs were established; and democratic educational reforms were carried out. Today, most of the students studying in higher education institutions in the German Democratic Republic are children of workers and peasants.

    While this kind of reform was being implemented in eastern Germany, the American and British occupation authorities were obstructing democratic reforms in western Germany. There, the forces of monopoly capital have resurfaced and created conditions for the revival of aggressive German militarism. At the same time, the imperialist occupying powers pursued a policy of trying to turn their occupied zones into a European war base. The implementation of this policy led them to separately establish the West German separatist state headed by the notorious national traitor Adenauer in September 1949.

    In order to stop this policy of division, the German Democratic Republic was founded on October 7, 1949, as the cornerstone of a unified, democratic, and independent Germany. J.V. Stalin called the founding of this republic a turning point in European history. For the first time in history, a truly democratic, peace-loving state with the working class in a decisive position appeared in the center of Europe—Germany. The long-tested German workers' leader, Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, was elected President of the German Democratic Republic. Otto Grotewohl, another Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, was elected Prime Minister. The Marxist workers' party—the Socialist Unity Party of Germany—became the leading force of the country, and all democratic forces united in the anti-fascist democratic bloc participated in the government.

    The primary task of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the government is to restore German unity on a democratic basis, which is the most important prerequisite for guaranteeing peace in Europe. In the struggle to achieve this goal, we first rely on the selfless support of the Soviet Union, which is the defender of German national interests at all international conferences. The Soviet government has repeatedly put forward constructive proposals to Western countries for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the restoration of German unity. The government and People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic have also repeatedly suggested to the Bonn government that consultations be held between eastern and western Germans, a suggestion that has been warmly welcomed by West German patriots.

    The Western imperialist countries and their Bonn puppets—the agents of German monopoly capital, large landowners, and militarists, Adenauer—refused to consider these proposals aimed at opening the way to a peaceful resolution of the German question. Instead, they signed the Bonn and Paris war treaties, which not only deepened the division of Germany but also revived German militarism within the framework of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, creating a threat to peace in Europe. In order to undermine the masses' resistance to this policy, Adenauer exhausted all kinds of means of deceiving the masses and using terror. Democratic forces in West Germany have suffered cruel repression, and the West German government has supported various fascist organizations and carried out abominable chauvinist revanchist agitation. Adenauer used these despicable methods to achieve "victory" in the September 6 elections. However, the election results obtained through terror, fabrication, deception, and the open intervention of American imperialism do not in any way mean that the West German people agree with the imperialist policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war and dividing Germany. The voters did not authorize Adenauer to implement the policy of the Bonn and Paris war treaties. Many people only voted for the Christian Democratic Union because they were fooled by Adenauer's deceptive statements; he deceived voters by saying that he was also willing to peacefully restore German unity and sign an agreement with the Soviet Union. The heads of the Social Democratic Party, by supporting the Adenauer government's revanchist policy, inciting hatred towards the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the German Democratic Republic, and opposing the united action of the working class, have become direct accomplices of the Adenauer government.

    The September 6 elections have further sharpened the struggle for the restoration of German unity and the situation in Europe. At the same time, the role of the German Democratic Republic as the foundation and bastion for a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany has become even more significant. The issue of restoring German unity is not determined by the reactionary Bonn parliament, but depends on the struggle of the German people against the Bonn and Paris treaties and for a peaceful resolution of the German question.

    The German Democratic Republic will, together with the patriotic forces in West Germany, and especially with the German Communist Party, continue to intensify the struggle against Adenauer's war policy. Of great significance in this struggle is the further strengthening and consolidation of the German Democratic Republic itself in the political and economic spheres. After the party and government corrected the mistake of excessively accelerating the pace of socialist construction, a new policy aimed at improving the material and cultural life of the working people in all aspects was implemented in June of this year. The imperialists and their servants attempted to obstruct the implementation of the new policy by launching a fascist provocation on June 17th, but as a result, this attempt failed miserably. The party and government continued to implement the new policy without hesitation. Thanks to the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, we have been able to achieve good results in improving food supply. The assistance of the powerful Soviet Union—the best friend of the German people—is of decisive significance for the implementation of the new policy and the struggle for German unity. The Soviet Union's assistance and support for the German people was particularly evident in the recent Soviet government's note to Western countries on the German question and in the Moscow talks between the Soviet government and the delegation of the German Democratic Republic government. The results of this meeting are of great historical significance for all the German people. How great the assistance given by the Soviet Union in many areas can be seen from this example: In addition to supplying various materials to the German Democratic Republic in accordance with the 1953 trade agreement, the Soviet Union has increased its additional supply by 590 million rubles. Due to the abolition of reparations from January 1, 1954, and due to the transfer of Soviet enterprises to Germany and other supplementary measures, the new policy of the German Democratic Republic government will be more effective next year.

    The regime of the German Democratic Republic is now more consolidated. In the economic field, especially in the production of food and daily consumer goods, a new upsurge has begun; in the fields of cultural education, science, and art, it is also continuing to develop. The foundations of socialism are being victoriously built in the German Democratic Republic. This development is also an extremely important factor in the great national struggle of the German people, because it sets an example of peaceful development for the West German people.

    In this great struggle—the struggle waged in the heart of Europe against American imperialism and its German servants—we are strengthened by being closely united with the great world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union. In our peace camp, the People's Republic of China occupies a prominent position. We are excited and proud to have the People's Republic of China as our best friend. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the brotherly cooperation between our two countries in the political, economic, and cultural fields has greatly developed. This increasingly consolidated relationship between the Chinese and German people is based on unbreakable and close friendship. A clear example of the solidarity and deep friendship shown by our Chinese friends in the development and role of the German Democratic Republic is the supplementary agreement to the trade agreement signed between the two countries not long ago. These agreements are a huge help for the German Democratic Republic government to implement the new policy, and our people will never forget this assistance from the Chinese people. The historic victory of the Chinese people and the great achievements in building a new China have set a brilliant example for the German people, pointing out how a nation can liberate itself from imperialist oppression, use its own strength to rely on the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, and embark on the road of peaceful, democratic, and happy life. We are excited that the German Democratic Republic and the great Chinese people have established friendly ties, and today we are standing on the same front as the Chinese people against our common enemy—American imperialism.

    The unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries strengthens the German Democratic Republic as the pillar of all German patriotic forces. We will do everything in our power to stop the enemy's war conspiracies, and we will never stop until our motherland is liberated from the American occupiers and until we win a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.

    德意志民主共和国成立四周年
    德国统一社会党政治局委员中央委员会书记 弗莱德·厄斯纳
    十月七日是德意志民主共和国成立四周年纪念。德意志民主共和国是从德国人民的坚韧不拔的意志中产生出来的。德国人民不能容忍美帝国主义所造成的德国的分裂，决心要在欧洲的心脏建立起一个统一、民主、独立与爱好和平的德国——这样一个德国和伟大苏联所结成的联盟，是捍卫欧洲和平的最可靠的保障。
    德意志民主共和国是在民主改革的基础上成长起来的。这种民主改革从一九四五年以来就在苏联占领的德国东部地区中进行了。根据波茨坦协定的规定，在德国这一部分地区内肃清了纳粹主义和军国主义，没收了容克地主的土地并把它们分配给劳动农民；把垄断资本家的企业没收成为全民所有的财产；建立了民主的行政机构；进行了民主的教育改革。今天在德意志民主共和国高等学校内学习的大部分学生都是工农子弟了。
    当德国东部实现这种革新的时候，美英占领当局却在德国的西部阻挠民主改革。在那里，垄断资本的势力重新抬头，并且为侵略性的德国军国主义的复活创造了条件。同时，帝国主义占领国家执行了企图把他们的占领区变成为欧洲战争基地的政策。这种政策的执行使他们在一九四九年九月单独地成立了以臭名昭著的民族叛徒阿登纳为首的西德分裂国家。
    为了制止这个分裂政策，在一九四九年十月七日成立了作为一个统一、民主和独立的德国的基石的德意志民主共和国。约·维·斯大林把这个共和国的成立称为欧洲历史的转折点。有史以来第一次在欧洲的中心——德国出现了一个工人阶级有着决定性地位的、真正民主的、爱好和平的国家。久经考验的德国工人领袖、德国统一社会党主席威廉·皮克当选为德意志民主共和国的总统。德国统一社会党的另一位主席奥托·格罗提渥当选为总理。马克思主义的工人阶级的政党——德国统一社会党成了国家的领导力量，所有团结在反法西斯民主联盟中的各民主力量都参加了政府。
    德国统一社会党和政府的首要任务，是在民主基础上恢复德国的统一，这是保证欧洲和平的最重要的先决条件。在争取实现这个目标的斗争中，我们首先依靠着苏联的大公无私的支持，苏联在所有的国际会议上都是德国民族利益的维护者。苏联政府向西方国家一再提出了为缔结对德和约与恢复德国统一的建设性的建议。德意志民主共和国的政府和人民议院也同样地一再向波恩政府建议进行东部和西部德国人的协商，这个建议获得了西德爱国人士的热烈欢迎。
    西方帝国主义国家和他们的波恩傀儡——德国垄断资本、大地主与军国主义分子的代理人阿登纳拒不考虑这些旨在打开和平解决德国问题的道路的建议，相反地却签订了波恩和巴黎战争条约，这些条约不但加深了德国的分裂，而且在侵略性的北大西洋公约的范围内复活德国军国主义，造成了对欧洲和平的威胁。为了破坏人民群众对这种政策的反抗，阿登纳用尽了各种欺骗群众和恐怖的手段。民主力量在西德遭受到残酷的镇压，西德政府支持了各种法西斯组织，进行了可恶的沙文主义的复仇煽动。阿登纳就是用这种卑劣的方式取得了九月六日选举的“胜利”。但是用恐怖、捏造、欺骗和美帝国主义的公开干涉所得到的选举结果，丝毫也不是意味着西德人民同意了扩军备战和分裂德国的帝国主义政策。选民根本没有授权阿登纳去执行波恩和巴黎战争条约的政策。许多人只是因为上了阿登纳欺骗性声明的当；他哄骗选民说，他也愿意和平恢复德国统一并与苏联签订协定，所以他们才投了基督教民主联盟的票。社会民主党的首脑们由于支持了阿登纳政府的复仇政策，煽动对苏联、各人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国的仇视以及反对工人阶级的统一行动，而成了阿登纳政府的直接帮凶。
    九月六日的选举使得争取恢复德国统一的斗争和欧洲的局势都进一步尖锐化了。同时，德意志民主共和国作为争取统一、爱好和平与民主的德国的基础和堡垒的作用也更加重大了。恢复德国统一的问题并不是由反动的波恩国会来决定的，而是取决于德国人民所进行的反对波恩和巴黎条约以及争取和平解决德国问题的斗争。
    德意志民主共和国将和西德的爱国力量，首先是和德国共产党共同行动，继续加紧进行反对阿登纳战争政策的斗争。在这个斗争中具有重大意义的是德意志民主共和国本身在政治上与经济上的进一步加强和巩固。在党和政府纠正了过高地加快建设社会主义速度的错误以后，在今年六月间开始实行了旨在从各方面来改善劳动人民物质与文化生活的新方针。帝国主义者及其仆从们在今年六月十七日企图以发动法西斯挑衅来阻挠新方针的执行，但结果这一企图是悲惨地失败了。党和政府毫不踌躇地继续执行着新方针。由于苏联的大公无私的援助，我们已经能够在改善食物供应方面获得了良好的成绩。强大的苏联——德国人民最好的朋友的援助，对于新方针的执行以及争取德国统一的斗争有着决定性的意义。苏联对德国人民的援助和支持，在最近苏联政府致西方国家的关于德国问题的照会中以及在苏联政府与德意志民主共和国政府代表团的莫斯科会谈中特别明显地表现了出来。这次会谈的结果，对于全体德国人民来说都是有着重大历史意义的。苏联在许多方面所给予的援助是多么巨大可以从这个实例中看出来：苏联除了根据一九五三年的贸易协定对德意志民主共和国供应各种物资外，还增加了价值五亿九千万卢布的额外供应。由于从一九五四年一月一日起取消赔款以及由于苏联企业移交德国和其他补充措施，德意志民主共和国政府的新方针在明年将有更大的成效。
    德意志民主共和国的政权现在是更为巩固了。在经济方面，特别是在食品和日用消费品的生产方面，开始了一个新的高涨；在文化教育、科学和艺术方面也正在继续向前发展。在德意志民主共和国内正在胜利地建设着社会主义基础。这种发展也是德国人民伟大民族斗争中的一个极为重要的因素，因为它给西德人民树立了一个和平发展的榜样。
    在这个伟大的斗争——在欧洲心脏所进行的反对美帝国主义及其德国仆从们的斗争中，我们因为和以苏联为首的伟大的世界和平阵营紧密团结而更加坚强起来。在我们这个和平阵营中，中华人民共和国占有着显著的地位。我们因为有中华人民共和国作为自己最好的朋友而感到兴奋和骄傲。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，我们两国之间在政治、经济和文化各方面的兄弟般的合作都有了很大的发展。德中人民这种日益巩固的关系是建立在牢不可破和亲密友谊的基础上的。我们中国朋友在德意志民主共和国的发展和作用上所表示的团结和深厚友谊的一个明显实例，就是在不久前签订的两国之间贸易协定的补充协定。这些协定是对于德意志民主共和国政府执行新方针的巨大援助，我国人民将永远不会忘记中国人民的这种援助。中国人民的历史性胜利和建设新中国的巨大成就，给德国人民树立了一个光辉的榜样，指出了一个民族如何从帝国主义压迫下解放出来、用自己的力量依靠伟大苏联的无私援助而走上和平、民主和幸福生活的道路。我们所引为兴奋的是，德意志民主共和国和伟大的中国人民已经建立了友谊的联系，我们今天正和中国人民站在同一条战线上反对着我们共同的敌人——美帝国主义。
    和苏联、中华人民共和国与各人民民主国家的牢不可破的友谊，加强了作为全德国爱国力量支柱的德意志民主共和国。我们将尽我们所有的力量来制止敌人的战争阴谋，不到我们的祖国从美国占领者手中解放出来，不到努力赢得一个统一、民主与爱好和平的德国，决不休止。
