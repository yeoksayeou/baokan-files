    Learning from Advanced Experience, Striving for Increased Production and Economy
    Wei Yuxi (left), a nationally renowned youth lathe operator at the Jinxi Chemical Plant, has successfully applied the Kolesov new-style lathe tool method and other advanced experiences, increasing labor productivity by two to three times. This photo shows Wei Yuxi introducing his experience in shortening auxiliary work time and increasing mechanical utilization rate to fellow workers in various workshops. In its capital construction, Anshan Iron and Steel Works implemented the Soviet advanced factory construction method, transporting pre-made finished or semi-finished products to the site according to the construction schedule for installation or use, which not only shortened the construction time but also ensured the quality of the project. This photo shows welders at the metal structure company construction site of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Capital Construction Department welding steel plates needed for the construction of a large rolling mill workshop. When needed on-site, they can be hoisted into place by cranes.
    The model factory – Factory 53 – the trade union often organizes advanced producers to demonstrate and promote advanced experiences during competitions. This photo shows Sun Zhengang, an advanced worker from the Second Workshop of the factory, demonstrating the Soviet advanced experience – operating a reinforced hard alloy tool.
    The new seamless steel tube plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Works has undergone comprehensive trial operation and is about to roll out China's first seamless steel tube. This photo shows the automatic piercing machine of the seamless steel tube plant undergoing trial operation. Liu Shanwu's team in the fitter workshop of Dalian Machine Tool Plant has created a device similar to a transmission belt, creating convenience for assembly line operations in the assembly workshop. This device places the workpiece on a wooden board equipped with four small wheels, and below is a track. After one process is completed, the workpiece is pushed by hand to the next process, greatly shortening the assembly time. This photo shows workers using this new device for assembly line operations. Workers at Huazhong Iron and Steel Company learned the Soviet advanced "full wind rapid" method and "low temperature heavy material" operation, setting a new national record for iron production in small furnaces. This photo shows iron being tapped from a small furnace at the factory.

    The Yi Shijuan Group of the No. 2 Spinning Shop of the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, which has been awarded the title of National Model Group in the textile industry, responded to the call for increased production and economy, ensuring that the average score of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method measurement group reached 92 points. This photo shows Jiang Yuefang, a female worker from the group, conscientiously implementing the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and cleaning the leather rollers during her patrol.
    The Qiujiang Machine Factory in Shanghai successfully manufactured boring bars using the Soviet advanced experience – flame quenching method. In the past, the factory did not know how to use the flame quenching method to manufacture boring machine spindles and boring bars, resulting in poor quality and reduced production numbers. Later, after engineer Cao Cunchang's painstaking research and learning from Soviet advanced experience, the trial production was successful. This photo shows engineer Cao Cunchang and workers using the flame quenching method to manufacture boring bars.
    The mass production of machine tools is one of the important conditions for the development of national heavy industry. This photo shows workers at the Jinan Second Machine Tool Plant manufacturing a Soviet-style four-meter planer.
    The Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine, which officially started production on July 1st, has launched a production upsurge. This photo shows workers using a Soviet coal loading machine to pack coal. In the past, loading a car of coal required eight hours for two and a half workers, but now it only takes eighteen minutes.
    Sun Wenxiu, an old technician at the No. 1 Branch of Tianjin Steel Plant, successfully improved the small rolling mill's groove, which can increase production and save more than 10 billion yuan for the country annually. This photo shows Sun Wenxiu studying and improving the roll groove shape of the small rolling mill.
    Xu Amao, a carpenter at the East China Construction Engineering Company, created a "full material limit box," which can increase work efficiency by 150 percent. This photo shows Xu Amao (right) performing at the new tool exhibition held by the East China Construction Engineering Company.

    学习先进经验努力增产节约
    全国闻名的锦西化工厂青年车工韦玉玺（左），成功地使用了科列索夫新式车刀法和其它先进经验，提高了劳动生产率二倍到三倍。这是韦玉玺向各车间工友介绍他自己缩短辅助工作时间、提高机械运用率经验的情形。鞍钢在基本建设中实行了苏联先进的工厂化施工法，把预先做好的成品或半成品，按照工程施工程序运到现场装置或使用，既缩短了施工时间，又可以保证工程质量。这是鞍钢基本建设处金属结构公司工地上的电焊工人，正在焊接建筑大型轧钢厂厂房需用的钢板，等到现场需要时，即可用吊车吊去安装。
    全国模范厂——五三工厂工会在竞赛中经常组织先进的生产者进行表演推广先进经验。这是该厂第二车间先进工人孙振纲表演苏联先进经验——强化硬质合金刀操作的情形。
    鞍钢新建无缝钢管厂已进行全面试车，即将轧出新中国第一根无缝钢管。这是无缝钢管厂的自动化穿孔机正在试行运转的情形。大连机床厂钳工车间刘善武小组创造了一种类似传动带的装置，给在装配车间进行流水作业法创造了便利条件。这种装置是将工作物放在装有四个小轱轮的木板上，下面铺有轨道。一道工序完毕后只用手一推就把工作物送给下一道工序，大大缩短了装配时间。这是工人们利用这种新的装置进行流水作业的情形。华中钢铁公司的工人学习了苏联先进的“全风快速”法、“低温重料”作业，创造了全国小型炉出铁的新纪录。这是该厂小型炉出铁的情形。（本期画刊由新华社、人民画报、解放日报、东北总工会、华东建筑工程公司、天津日报、大众日报、山西日报供稿）
    获得全国纺织工业模范小组称号的国营上海第二棉纺织厂二纺细纱间裔式娟小组，响应增产节约的号召，保证郝建秀工作法测定分数小组平均达九十二分。这是该组女工蒋月芳认真执行郝建秀工作法，在巡回作业中做好擦皮辊的清洁工作。
    上海虬江机器厂学习苏联先进经验——火焰焠火法制造镗杆成功。过去该厂制造镗床主轴和镗杆时因不懂得运用火焰焠火法制造，质量不高，降低了生产数字。后经曹存昌工程师的苦心钻研，学习苏联先进经验才试制成功。这是曹存昌工程师和工人们正运用火焰焠火法制造镗杆情形。
    工作母机的大量生产是发展国家重工业的重要条件之一。这是济南第二机器厂职工制造苏联式四公尺龙门刨床的情形。
   “七一”正式生产的阜新海州露天煤矿已掀起生产热潮。这是工人们用苏联装煤机捣垛的情形。过去装一车煤，两个半工需要八小时，现在只要十八分钟。
    天津钢厂一分厂老技术工人孙文秀改进小型轧钢机轧槽成功，全年可为国家增产节约一百多亿元。这是孙文秀正在研究改进小型轧钢机轧辊槽型的情形。
    华东建筑工程公司木工徐阿毛创造了“饱料限度箱”，可以提高工作效率百分之一百五十。这是徐阿毛（右）在华东建筑工程公司举办的新工具展览会上表演的情形。
