Victory Surely Belongs to Peace
--Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's Entry into Korea
Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, Guo Moruo

The third anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's entry into Korea has arrived. This is a day for all Chinese people to express their heartfelt celebration.

Since the end of World War II in 1945, American imperialism has gradually revealed its monstrous ambition to annex the entire world. Its clutches, one grasping Western Europe, the other grasping Eastern Asia, sought to embrace the entire globe into its own bosom.

The great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution delivered a heavy blow to its hand grasping Asia, sweeping its aggressive forces from mainland China. Its ambitions unfulfilled, it hastily launched the war of aggression against Korea in June 1950, while simultaneously occupying our Taiwan. Its aims were clear: it was following the old Japanese imperialist plan of aggression, advancing from both north and south, seeking to restore its former control over mainland China. It did not anticipate that the young Democratic People's Republic of Korea would possess such resilient strength to resist its massive offensive. It even less anticipated that the people of the People's Republic of China, established just over a year earlier, after a long period of the Anti-Japanese War and the revolutionary war, while concentrating their efforts on recovering from the wounds of war, would raise high the righteous banner of "Resisting America, Aiding Korea, and Protecting Our Homes and Defending Our Country," organize the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and march valiantly and spiritedly across the Yalu River, joining the heroic Korean People's Army in fighting side by side.

Once the heroic Korean People's Army received the strong support of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, it quickly drove the American imperialist invading forces all the way back from the Yalu River to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, stabilizing the situation. Despite American imperialism's persistent unwillingness to accept defeat, and its use of extremely brutal means of war, it ultimately could not reverse the situation, and was finally forced to accept armistice negotiations, and even more finally forced to sign the armistice agreement. The Korean armistice, which the people of the world were concerned about, was finally realized through the joint efforts of the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

The great victory of the Chinese and Korean people shattered American imperialism's aggressive intentions, and dealt another heavy blow to its hand grasping Asia. This great victory thoroughly exposed the outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature of American imperialism, thereby expanding the internal contradictions within the imperialist aggressive camp, and strengthening the world's people's confidence in the inevitable victory of peace. This great victory not only ensured peace in the Far East, but also consolidated world peace. All peace-loving and just people around the world are sincerely rejoicing and encouraged by this great victory.

Specifically for us Chinese people, we should especially thank our most beloved people—the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The victory of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting alongside the Korean People's Army has especially ensured the safety of our motherland. Furthermore, due to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's high degree of patriotism and internationalist enthusiasm, our entire nation has received a deep education, and therefore, on the national defense front, on the production front, on the social transformation and ideological remolding movement front, and on the movement front for defending world peace, we have all gained role models for learning, and victoriously carried out our work. In the past three years, our motherland has quickly moved from the recovery phase to the development phase of planned construction. Our Five-Year Plan for construction has already begun, and all Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, are advancing along the general line of national construction towards the goal of socialist industrialization. The victories on various fronts are inseparable from the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and are inseparable from the great selfless assistance of our great ally, the Soviet Union, and the victory on the Korean battlefield has undoubtedly played a particularly guaranteeing role.

The Chinese people and our government have consistently advocated resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation. The successful and difficult Korean armistice negotiations have brought a glimmer of peace to the people of the world, and everyone is hoping that a higher-level political conference can achieve the same success, paving the way for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and for the five major powers to consult on consolidating the cause of world peace. However, the enemy is not reconciled to its defeat. Although its world aggression policy has suffered a setback in the failed war of aggression against Korea, it does not want to give up. It has been using its consistent shameless tricks to undermine the Korean armistice. It is constantly obstructing the thorough implementation of the armistice agreement, obstructing the rapid convening of the political conference, and is unwilling to see the Korean issue resolved peacefully and rationally. It is still supporting corrupt reactionary or colonial rule everywhere to suppress the people. It is still supporting the remnants of Nazi forces in West Germany in the West, and is intensifying the rearmament of Japan in the East. It is still manipulating the United Nations as a tool to deceive the people of the world. It is still implementing a policy of blockade and monopoly, preventing the smooth exchange of international trade and human culture.

The situation before us is very clear, and we must not be intoxicated by our victory and relax our vigilance. Therefore, today, as we commemorate the third anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's entry into Korea, we must further strengthen our determination: we must continue to strengthen the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea. We have already helped the Korean people defeat the invading enemy, and we must also help the Korean people recover from the wounds of war. We must vigorously practice increasing production and practicing economy, on the one hand, doing our best to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and implement the desire for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; on the other hand, gradually realizing the socialist industrialization of national construction, so as to enhance the strength of the peace camp.

The democratic peace camp headed by the Soviet Union is invincible. Its unity is becoming increasingly consolidated, its foundation is becoming increasingly expanded, and its strength is becoming increasingly abundant. We stand on the eastern forefront of defending world peace, and have such an incomparably strong backing. In contrast, the imperialist camp led by American imperialism is increasingly exposing irreconcilable internal contradictions. American imperialism relies on war preparations and war fighting to maintain the excessive profits of a few millionaires, but the more it moves in this direction, the more it will only deepen domestic class contradictions and contradictions between countries within the imperialist camp. Such a situation has to increasingly change the balance between peace forces and war forces.

Our responsibility is to continuously increase the strength of the peace camp to overwhelm war. Let us always maintain clear vigilance and preparedness in all aspects, and on the basis of the great victories we have already achieved, continue to strive for even greater victories!

Victory inevitably belongs to the peace camp!

    胜利必然属于和平
    ——纪念中国人民志愿军出国作战三周年
    中国人民抗美援朝总会主席  郭沫若
    中国人民志愿军出国作战三周年纪念日到了。这是全中国人民都要表示衷心庆祝的日子。
    自一九四五年第二次世界大战结束后，美帝国主义便逐渐暴露了它的吞并全世界的天大的野心。它的魔掌，一手抓着欧洲西部，一手抓着亚洲东部，想把全地球抱进它自己的怀里。
    中国人民革命的伟大胜利，对它抓着亚洲的一只魔手，给了一记很沉重的打击，把它的侵略势力从中国大陆扫荡了。它野心不死，急急忙忙地在一九五○年六月便发动了侵朝战争，同时还占领了我们的台湾。它的目的是很明显的，它是蹈袭了旧日本帝国主义的侵略计划，南北并进，想在我们中国大陆恢复它的以往的控制。它没有料到年青的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国竟有那样强韧的力量抗击了它的大举进攻。它更没有料到建国以来仅仅一年余的中华人民共和国的人民，在长期的抗日战争和革命战争之后，在集中力量恢复战争创伤的期中，却高高地举起了“抗美援朝、保家卫国”的正义旗帜，组织了中国人民志愿军，雄赳赳、气昂昂地跨过鸭绿江，和英勇的朝鲜人民军一道并肩作战了。
    英勇的朝鲜人民军一旦得到了中国人民志愿军的有力的支援，很快地便把美帝国主义的侵略军队，从鸭绿江边一直赶回到三八线附近，把战局稳定了下来。尽管美帝国主义始终不肯死心，使用尽极端残酷的战争手段，但终于不能把战局扭转，终于被迫接受停战谈判，更终于被迫在停战协定上签字。全世界人民所关心的朝鲜停战，便在英雄的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的共同努力之下，终于实现了。
    中朝两国人民的伟大胜利，打破了美帝国主义的侵略意图，对它想抓紧着亚洲的魔手，又给了一记很沉重的打击。这一伟大胜利，彻底暴露了美帝国主义的外强中干的本质，因而扩大了帝国主义侵略阵营的内部矛盾，而加强了世界人民和平必胜的信心。这一伟大胜利，不仅保障了远东和平，而同时也巩固了世界和平。全世界爱好和平正义的人民，都在为这一伟大胜利而衷心地感受着欢欣鼓舞。
    单就我们中国人民来说，我们是应该特别感谢我们最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军的。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战的胜利，更特别保障了我们祖国的安全。再由于中国人民志愿军的高度的爱国主义与国际主义的热诚，使我们全国人民受到很深入的教育，因而在国防战线上，在生产战线上，在社会改造、思想改造运动战线上，在保卫世界和平运动战线上，我们都得到学习的榜样，胜利地进行了我们的工作。在三年当中，我们的祖国很快地便由恢复阶段走上计划建设的发展阶段。我们的五年建设计划已经开始了，全中国人民正在毛主席和中国共产党的领导之下，沿着国家建设的总路线，向着社会主义工业化的目标前进。各种战线上的胜利，都是和毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导分不开的，和伟大的盟邦苏联的伟大无私的帮助是分不开的，而在朝鲜战场上的胜利无疑地是特别起了保障的作用。
    中国人民和我们的政府是一贯主张以和平协商的方式解决国际争端的。困难复杂的朝鲜停战谈判获得成功，为世界人民带来了和平的曙光，大家都在渴望着更高一级的政治会议能够获得同样的成功，为和平解决朝鲜问题，为五大国协商巩固世界和平的事业铺平道路。但是，敌人却是死不甘心的。它的世界侵略政策虽然在侵朝战争的失败中遭受了挫折，但它并不想放弃。它对于朝鲜停战，一直还在使用着它一贯的无耻伎俩，企图加以破坏。它正不断地阻挠停战协定的彻底实施，阻挠政治会议的迅速召开，不愿意使朝鲜问题得到和平合理的解决。它依然在四处支持腐朽的反动统治或殖民地统治，以镇压人民。它依然在西方扶植西德的纳粹残余势力，在东方加紧重新武装日本。它依然操纵着联合国作为愚弄世界人民的工具。它依然在执行着封锁垄断的政策，使国际贸易和人类文化不能顺畅地交流。
    局势摆在我们的面前是很清楚的，我们决不能陶醉于我们的胜利而松弛了我们的警惕。因此，在今天我们纪念中国人民志愿军出国作战三周年的时候，我们就要更加坚定我们的决心：要把抗美援朝的运动继续加强。我们已经帮助朝鲜人民战胜了侵略的敌人，我们还要帮助朝鲜人民恢复战争的创伤。我们要厉行增产节约，一面尽力支援中国人民志愿军，贯彻和平解决朝鲜问题的志愿；一面逐步实现国家建设的社会主义工业化，以增强和平阵营的力量。
    以苏联为首的民主和平阵营是不可战胜的。它的团结日益巩固，基础日益扩大，实力日益雄厚。我们站在保卫世界和平的东方的最前线，是有着这样坚强无比的后盾的。和这相反，美帝国主义所领导的帝国主义阵营却愈来愈暴露出无可调和的内部矛盾。美帝国主义是靠着战争的准备和进行来维持少数亿万富翁们的超额利润的，但愈朝这个方向前进便只好使国内的阶级矛盾和帝国主义阵营内的国与国之间的矛盾日益加深。这样的情形也就不得不日益改变和平力量与战争力量的对比。
    我们的责任就是要不断增加和平阵营的力量来压倒战争。让我们在各方面始终保持着清醒的警惕和戒备，在已经获得的伟大胜利的基础上，不断地争取更伟大的胜利吧！
    胜利是必然属于和平阵营的！
