    Anshan Iron and Steel's Seamless Steel Tube Plant and Large Rolling Mill
    Actively Prepare for Production Commencement
    [News from this newspaper] Anshan Iron and Steel's newly built automated Seamless Steel Tube Plant and automated Large Rolling Mill are nearing complete construction and are actively preparing for commencement of production.
    The construction and installation work of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant has completed the connection of electricity, water, oil, and gas. Comprehensive trial operations began on September 15th. Currently, the machine tools of Factory No. 1 of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant and the cooling tables and shears of the roll repair workshop of Factory No. 3 have completed trial runs. Other mechanical equipment is undergoing trial runs. After the trial runs, hot rolling tests will begin, and production will commence soon. At present, the plant has completed all preparations for the start of production. A large amount of raw materials needed for the start of production are being transported from outside the plant. Technicians and workers entering the workshop are inspecting and cleaning the mechanical equipment handed over from the construction department. Many management personnel are continuing to receive the completed equipment, starting to develop various production-related forms, and initially establishing various management systems. Various management and production personnel are also basically fully equipped. At present, a large production force mastering modern tube rolling technology has been formed, including more than 30 workers and technicians who have studied tube rolling in the Soviet Union, who are the backbone of this production force. In addition, there are veteran workers transferred from brother factories, technicians assigned by the state, and young farmers from the countryside. With the help of Soviet experts and technicians from the plant, after a long period of study, they have quickly mastered the technology. The Seamless Steel Tube Plant has received great assistance from Soviet experts in preparing for the start of production. The plans for cultivating technical talents and the management organization and system in the factory were all formulated with the help of Soviet experts.
    The entire project of the Anshan Iron and Steel Large Rolling Mill is nearing completion, and electricity was safely supplied on September 12th. Currently, the plant's employees are actively preparing for production. Dozens of workers and technicians from the plant who went to the Soviet Union and Chongqing No. 101 Factory to study have returned to the plant. Two hundred workers and technicians who participated in the construction of the plant and will participate in production are familiar with the performance of the machinery during the construction process. Seven hundred workers who are about to participate in production are studying operating techniques intensively, and their average score in each test is above four points.
    Tools to be used after the start of production, including rolling rolls weighing more than ten tons and thousands of hand tools, are being sent successively by Anshan Iron and Steel Machinery General Plant, Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, and Harbin Machinery Tenth Plant. People are being sent to various places to urge delivery of the goods that have not yet been delivered.
    The production technical operating procedures, safety regulations, and duty regulations have been initially translated and are now being revised and checked.

    鞍钢无缝钢管厂和大型轧钢厂
    积极进行开工生产的准备工作
    【本报讯】鞍钢新建自动化无缝钢管厂和自动化大型轧钢厂即将全部竣工，正积极进行开工生产准备工作。
    无缝钢管厂建筑安装工程，已完成了通电、通水、通油、通煤气等工程，九月十五日开始全面试车。现在无缝钢管厂一厂的机床和三厂轧辊修理车间的冷却台，剪断机等都试车完毕。其他机械设备正在试车。试车后即将开始热试轧，很快就可以投入生产。目前该厂已做好开工生产的各项准备工作。开工生产需要的大批原材料，正从厂外运往厂内。进入车间的技术人员和工人们，正在看管和清洗从施工部门移交过来的机械设备。许多管理人员还在继续接收完工的各种设备，开始制订有关生产的各种表格，并初步建立各种管理制度。各种管理人员和生产人员也基本配备齐全。目前，一支掌握现代轧管技术的生产大军已经组成，其中三十多个去苏联学习过轧管的工人和技术人员，是这支生产大军中的骨干。此外，还有兄弟厂调来的老工人、国家统一分配来的技术人员和来自农村的青年农民。这些人在苏联专家和本厂技术人员的帮助下，经过长时期的学习，都很快地掌握了技术。无缝钢管厂在准备开工生产的工作中，得到了苏联专家的大力帮助。工厂内培养技术人才的计划、管理机构和制度，都是由苏联专家帮助制订出来的。
    鞍钢大型轧钢厂全部工程即将竣工，九月十二日已安全送电。现在该厂职工正积极进行生产准备工作。该厂几十名到苏联和重庆一○一厂学习的工人、技术人员已经回厂了。二百名参加了建厂工作又将参加生产的工人、技术人员在建厂过程中熟悉了机械的性能。七百名即将参加生产的工人紧张地学习着操作技术，在每次测验中他们的平均分数都在四分以上。
    开工后即将使用的工具，包括十余吨重的轧辊和几千件手用工具，正在由鞍钢机械总厂、沈阳重型机器厂、哈尔滨机械十厂陆续送来。尚未交货的，也正在派人到各地催促。
    生产技术操作规程、安全规程、职责条例已初步译完，现正进行修正与核对中。
