Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 17th: Today, in explanation tent No. 15, a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, after explanation, expressed his desire to return to the motherland. However, due to obstruction by the US "observer representatives" and "detaining party representatives," he was ultimately not repatriated but placed under the sole custody of Indian troops.

In this incident, the aforementioned US personnel used various means, even unilaterally withdrawing from the meeting, attempting to threaten the prisoner of war and obstruct and interrupt the explanation work. The actions of the US personnel in infringing upon the authority of the subordinate bodies of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and obstructing the explanation work have reached an extremely blatant level.

During the explanation, this captured soldier expressed his desire to return to the motherland. At this point, the US "observer representative" violated the "Rules of Procedure for Explanation and Interview," unilaterally speaking and demanding the suspension of the meeting. When the Indian chairman of the subordinate body of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission stopped him, he argued loudly, "I am a representative; what right do you have to stop me from speaking?" Finally, he stormed out of the meeting with the so-called detaining party representative, attempting to disrupt the explanation work. The chairman immediately stated, "If you want to leave, please leave quietly," and insisted that the explanation work continue. The US "observer representative's" conspiracy to interrupt the meeting failed, and he engaged in an unreasonable quarrel with Harkisar, the Indian political advisor to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, outside the tent before returning to the explanation tent. However, instead of immediately taking a seat, he stood at the door, glaring at the prisoner of war, attempting to influence him as he struggled with his fear. The US so-called detaining party representative was once expelled from the tent by the chairman for speaking without permission.

The US "observer representative" and "detaining party representative" requested to speak more than ten times during the explanation. They spoke loudly, disrupting the explanation and attracting the attention of the prisoner of war. When the prisoner of war looked back in fear, they gestured and used their chins to indicate that the prisoner of war should go out the door used by those who had not applied for repatriation. Despite protests and stern accusations from our explanation representatives, they did not stop.

The "translators" provided by the US to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission also repeatedly violated the "Rules of Procedure for Explanation and Interview" and exceeded their translation authority. When the prisoner of war first said, "I want to return home," after our translator translated, the US "translator" actually said that the prisoner of war had never said he wanted to return home. This US "translator" even attempted to prevent our explanation representative from speaking. When he was sternly stopped by the chairman, the chairman said, "Your only duty is to translate!" On another occasion, this "translator" deliberately made trouble, saying that the meeting time was too long and should be adjourned, attempting to interrupt the explanation. He was once expelled from the explanation tent by the chairman.

The captured soldier who listened to the explanation in tent No. 15 today also concentratedly reflected the vicious control and long-term terror and persecution of prisoners of war by US-Chiang secret agents. Since entering the tent, apart from muttering a few words like "Return to Taiwan," he remained silent, constantly sighing, sweating profusely, pacing back and forth, and was very nervous. The surrounding noises and the shouts of the special agent elements among the prisoners of war made him flustered. He looked around fearfully from time to time, looking back at the door he had entered, which was also used by those who had not applied for repatriation, but he was met with the cold, threatening gaze of the US "observer representative" and "detaining party representative." At this point, he sighed deeply and slumped down, repeating this several times. Twice he had already expressed his desire to return home and walked towards the door for those applying for repatriation, but the Swedish representative in the subordinate body of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission asked the chairman to stop him and ask him to consider it for another five minutes, which further increased his suspicion and fear. Finally, General Thimayya decided to keep him in separate custody, but when he saw that he was going to be taken back the way he had come, he struggled and ran back, exiting the tent through the door for those applying for repatriation. He was put on General Thimayya's car and taken away for separate custody.

### 美方人员猖狂侵犯中立国遣返委员会的职权  竟在解释过程中阻挠我方被俘人员遣返

    美方人员猖狂侵犯中立国遣返委员会的职权
    竟在解释过程中阻挠我方被俘人员遣返
    【新华社开城十七日电】今天在第十五号解释帐篷中有一名中国人民志愿军被俘人员经解释后虽已表示了要返回祖国的愿望，但由于美方的所谓观察代表和拘留方代表等的阻挠，终于未能遣返，而交由印度部队单独看管。
    在这次事件中，美方上述人员使用了各种手段甚至擅自退出会议，企图借此威胁战俘并阻挠与中断解释工作。美方人员这种侵犯中立国遣返委员会附属机构的职权和阻挠解释工作的行为已达到十分猖狂的地步。
    在解释进行中，这个被俘人员表示了要返回祖国的愿望，这时，美方“观察代表”就违反“解释和访问工作细则”，擅自发言，要求中止会议。中立国遣返委员会附属机构印度主席制止他时，他就大声争辩：“我是代表，你凭什么制止我发言？”最后竟与所谓拘留方代表一起大吵大闹地退出会议，企图使解释工作中断。主席当即表明，“要退出请安静地退出”，并坚持解释工作继续进行。美方“观察代表”中断会议的阴谋未能得逞，就在帐篷外边和中立国遣返委员会印度政治顾问哈克萨尔无理争吵了一番以后，又回到解释帐篷，但他不马上就座，而站在门口，瞪着战俘，企图在战俘与恐惧情绪作斗争时来影响他。美方的所谓拘留方代表则曾因擅自发言，一度被主席逐出帐篷。
    美方“观察代表”和“拘留方代表”在解释进行中要求发言在十次以上，他们并大声说话，扰乱解释，吸引战俘的注意。当战俘恐惧地回顾时，他们就打手势并用下巴示意战俘从未申请遣返的门走出去，虽经我方解释代表抗议和严厉指斥，但仍未停止。
    美方提供中立国遣返委员会的“翻译”也不断发生违反“解释和访问工作细则”和超越翻译职权的行为。当战俘第一次说：“我要回国”时，我方翻译译完后，美方“翻译”竟说战俘未曾说过他要回国；这个美方“翻译”甚至企图阻止我方解释代表发言，当被主席严厉制止，主席说：“你的唯一职务是翻译！”还有一次，这个“翻译”故意捣乱地说会议时间太长，应该休息，企图中断解释，当被主席一度逐出解释帐篷。
    今天在十五号帐篷听取解释的这个被俘人员，也集中地反映了美蒋特务对战俘的恶毒控制和长期的恐怖迫害的影响。他自从进入帐篷以后，除掉喃喃自语似地说了几句“回台湾”、“回台湾”之外，始终一言不发，一直是唉声叹气，满头冒汗，来回走动，情绪十分紧张；周围的声音和战俘中的特务分子的叫骂声，都使他发生悸动。他不时恐惧地四面观望，回头看看他进来的也就是由未申请遣返者使用的门口，但他遇到的却是美方“观察代表”和“拘留方代表”的冰冷的威胁性的目光，这时他就长叹一声，颓然坐下，这样反复了好几次。有两次他已表示要回国，并走向申请遣返的门口，但中立国遣返委员会附属机构中的瑞典代表却要求主席予以阻止，而要他再考虑五分钟，这就更增加了他的疑惧。最后蒂迈雅将军决定把他单独看管，但他看到要带他走回他进来时的路上去，就挣扎着跑回来，由申请遣返的门走出帐篷。他被送上蒂迈雅将军的汽车载去单独看管。
