Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th—The work of erecting and inspecting the Military Demarcation Line markers has been completed. Thus, the Military Demarcation Line, stretching from the confluence of the Imjin River and the Han River in the west to the east coast and traversing the center of Korea, has been marked not only on military maps but also on the ground.

A total of 1,277 markers were erected along the Military Demarcation Line, with the Korean-Chinese side responsible for erecting 527 and the U.S. side responsible for 750. Since both sides began erecting markers on August 8th and 9th, the Korean-Chinese side, with a serious and responsible attitude to ensure the stability of the Korean armistice, proceeded quickly and accurately within our responsible area, and completed the erection of all markers by August 17th. However, the U.S. side adopted a delaying tactic and proceeded very slowly. After repeated urging by the Korean-Chinese side at the meetings of the secretaries of both sides of the Military Armistice Commission and at the joint observer group meetings, it was not until September 2nd that the U.S. side completed the erection of all markers in its responsible area, more than ten days later than the Korean-Chinese side.

During the mutual and joint inspection of the Military Demarcation Line markers, it was also clear that: in the area responsible for the Korean-Chinese side, because of the extremely serious and responsible attitude in erecting the markers, there were very few errors, and when individual markers were found to be non-compliant or deviated in position during the inspection, they were carefully corrected; however, the markers erected by the U.S. side in its responsible area were full of errors. Our side's inspection found a total of 129 places that needed to be corrected due to being positioned too far north, accounting for more than 17% of all the markers erected by the U.S. side, with the largest deviation encroaching into our demilitarized zone by more than 300 meters. When the personnel of our side of the joint observer groups, responsible for supervising and inspecting the Military Demarcation Line markers, demanded that the U.S. side quickly correct all deviations, the U.S. side repeatedly denied and refused to correct the errors. Only after our personnel and U.S. personnel used measuring instruments to compare the actual measurements with the common map issued by the Military Armistice Commission, did the U.S. side have to make corrections. The markers erected by the U.S. side in the area responsible for the third group of the Kaesong area joint observer group were not finally corrected until October 10th.

    军事分界线标志物全部检查完毕
    我方纠正美方许多人为的错误
    【新华社开城十二日电】军事分界线标志物的树立和检查工作已全部完成。至此，西起临津江与汉江汇流处东至东海岸横贯朝鲜中部的军事分界线，不仅是在军用地图上，而且已在实地上被标志下来。
    在军事分界线上，双方共树立了一千二百七十七个标志物，其中由朝中方面负责树立的共五百二十七个，由美方负责树立的共七百五十个。自双方在八月八日和九日先后开始树立标志物以来，朝中方面始终以保证朝鲜停战稳定的严肃认真的态度，在我方负责地段内迅速准确地进行，到八月十七日就已全部完成了树立标志物的工作；而美方却采取拖延态度，进行得十分缓慢，经朝中方面在军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议及各联合观察小组会议上数度催促，直到九月二日才将其负责地段内的标志物全部树立完毕，比朝中方面拖长了十多天时间。
    在双方交互检查和共同检查军事分界线标志物时，也可以明显地看出：在朝中方面负责的地段内，由于在树立标志物时极其严肃认真，因此错误很少，而且在检查中发现个别标志物不合规定或位置有偏差时也即予以认真纠正；而美方在其负责的地段内树立的标志物则错误百出，经我方检查发现位置偏北需要纠正的共一百二十九处，占其树立的全部标志物的百分之十七强，相差最远的向北侵入我方非军事区竟达三百公尺以上。当负责监督与检查军事分界线标志物工作的各联合观察小组我方人员要求美方迅速纠正所有偏差时，美方却一再抵赖，不肯纠正错误，经我方人员和美方人员用测量仪器对照军事停战委员会发下的共同地图实地测量以后，美方才不得不加以修正。开城地区联合观察小组第三组美方负责的地段内树立的标志物，直到十月十日才最后修正完毕。
