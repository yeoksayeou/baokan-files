To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China:

On the occasion of the National Day of the People's Republic of China, dear Comrade Chairman, on behalf of the entire people of Czechoslovakia and in my own name, I extend to you, and through you to the Chinese people, my heartfelt congratulations and respect. The Czechoslovak people still remember the historically significant day of the founding of the People's Republic of China: from that day on, a new period began in the history of the Asian countries struggling to free themselves from imperialist oppression. The great achievements made by the Chinese people in the past four years in national economic construction and cultural development have excited the Czechoslovak people. The heroism of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who supported the Korean people's just struggle for independence and against aggression, and the tireless efforts of the Government of the People's Republic of China to achieve a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, are a historically significant guarantee for the struggle to defend world peace led by the great Soviet Union.

Comrade Chairman, I wish you and all the Chinese people more achievements in the peaceful construction of your country.

To Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China:

On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, on behalf of the Czechoslovak Government and people and in my own name, I extend to you, dear Comrade Premier, my most heartfelt congratulations. The Czechoslovak people are watching with joy and excitement the achievements made by the Chinese people in building their own country, in repelling aggression, and in ending the Korean War. The great role of the People's Republic of China as a powerful factor for the independence and security of the peoples of the Far East and for world peace has been proven once again.

The People's Republic of China, by engaging in the persistent struggle for peace and democratic relations among nations and for resolving disputes through consultation, shoulder to shoulder with the great Soviet Union, has year after year gained even more respect and love from all peace-loving people. The Czechoslovak people are happy that the economic, cultural, and political relations between our two countries have developed so richly.

The Czechoslovak Republic and Government, for the sake of the interests of our two countries, and for the sake of further consolidating and strengthening the powerful peace camp headed by the great Soviet Union, will spare no effort to strengthen and expand the friendship and cooperation between our two countries.

Comrade Premier, I wish you and all the Chinese people further achievements in the work of prospering your motherland.

Mattern to Chairman Mao

To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference:

On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please allow me, respected Comrade Mao Zedong, on behalf of the people of the German Democratic Republic and myself, to extend to you and the Chinese people my heartfelt congratulations.

In the four years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people have achieved tremendous achievements in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life, laying the foundation for the first general election to be held in 1953. Combined with the start of the People's Republic of China's first five-year plan in 1953 and the victory over the imperialist aggressors in Korea, this general election will be a historic milestone on the road to victory for the Chinese people. It once again proves that a government can only guarantee the people's path to happiness, prosperity, and peace if it has the support and trust of the people's strength. Only with friendship with the great Soviet Union can the people's beautiful new life be guaranteed.

Respected Comrade Mao Zedong, I wish you and the Chinese people further great achievements in the cause of building a strong and peace-loving China.

Pieck to Chairman Mao

To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Dear Comrade Chairman:

On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please allow me, on behalf of the peace-loving German people and in my own name, to extend to you and the great Chinese people my most heartfelt congratulations.

We watch with admiration and joy the great achievements made by the People's Republic of China in restoring and building industry and agriculture in the short period since its founding, exceeding the highest production levels in Chinese history. The reason why the Chinese working people have been able to achieve achievements in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural construction is because they have the selfless assistance of the great socialist Soviet Union. All peace-loving people see in the fraternal alliance of the great Chinese people and the Soviet people the strongest guarantee for maintaining and ensuring world peace.

Thanks to the sincere assistance of the brave Chinese People's Volunteers to the heroic Korean people, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, and a great victory was achieved in the struggle against the imperialist interventionists. This victory of the peace forces in the Far East encourages all patriots in Germany and strengthens the struggle for a peaceful solution to the most important issue in Europe - restoring German unity and concluding a just peace treaty with Germany.

I heartily congratulate the Chinese people on achieving further great achievements and wish you good health. Comrade Chairman, please accept my sincere and friendly respect.

Grotewohl to Premier Zhou

To Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Respected Comrade Premier:

On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please allow me, on behalf of the government and people of the German Democratic Republic, and in my own name, Comrade Premier, to extend to you, to the Central People's Government, and to the Chinese people our heartfelt congratulations.

The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, with their brave and victorious operations, supported the Korean people's staunch struggle for freedom and against the American interventionists, and promoted the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, thereby giving a severe blow to the forces of aggression and international adventurers.

The People's Republic of China, having formed a close friendship with the great socialist Soviet Union, has today become a decisive factor in political and economic matters in the Asia and Pacific region. Its victorious path is a brilliant example for all peoples still under imperialist oppression. The German people, who are struggling to achieve national unity and conclude a just peace treaty, have gained the support and sympathy of the great Chinese people. They are especially grateful for the selfless and significant assistance often given by the People's Republic of China to the German Democratic Republic.

I heartily congratulate you, the Chinese government, and the peace-loving Chinese people on achieving further great achievements in all aspects of the political, economic, and cultural development of the People's Republic of China.

All peace-loving German people deeply admire the great achievements that the people of your country have made in the cause of building a free and independent new China. The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, fighting bravely side by side with the Korean People's Army, made a decisive contribution to restoring peace in East Asia. The victorious signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement once again proved the role and importance of the People's Republic of China in the international arena, which is a great victory for the cause of peace worldwide.

All peace-loving people, including the peace-loving German people, unanimously support the Soviet government's proposal to maintain and ensure world peace, regarding the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China as a major power in the United Nations. The continuous consolidation and development of friendly relations between our two countries is an important factor in strengthening the world peace camp headed by the powerful Soviet Union.
