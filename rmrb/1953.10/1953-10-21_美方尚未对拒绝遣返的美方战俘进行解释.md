Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 20th - To this day, the U.S. side has not yet begun explaining the situation to the 359 U.S. POWs who have refused repatriation.

    The U.S. explanation team has publicly stated that it will delay the start of the explanation work for some time. According to a United Press International report on the 19th, U.S. authorities hope to make the U.S. POWs who refuse repatriation wait longer in order to "reduce their enthusiasm for communism." Sources say that some people on the U.S. side even advocate waiting thirty days or longer before starting explanations to the POWs.

    Many reports reveal that the U.S. side is secretly conducting intensive arrangements for the explanation work for U.S. POWs who will not be directly repatriated. According to a UPI report: the whereabouts of the U.S. "explanation personnel" are kept secret, and they are relatively isolated from the outside world; news reporters cannot even take pictures of them. These officers participating in the U.S. "explanation team" recently completed two weeks of "extremely secret training" in Daegu, Korea. According to a Reuters report on the 17th, in order to familiarize the U.S. "explanation personnel" with the "offensive approach" towards U.S. POWs who are unwilling to be repatriated, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff specially flew a "consultant" named Joseph Lohman to Korea to give a series of lectures to the "explanation personnel." This Lohman is a "consultant to police departments in many U.S. cities." From his identity, one can see what he is "teaching" the U.S. "explanation personnel."

    However, despite such busy preparations, the U.S. side still lacks confidence in whether it can pull back the U.S. POWs who refuse to return to reactionary rule. A UPI, Munsan dispatch on the 19th quoted a U.S. official as saying: "We expect these people (referring to U.S. POWs who will not be directly repatriated) to really cause us difficulties."

### 美方尚未对拒绝遣返的美方战俘进行解释

    美方尚未对拒绝遣返的美方战俘进行解释
    【新华社开城二十日电】直到今天为止，美方还没有开始对三百五十九名拒绝遣返的美方战俘进行解释。
    美方解释小组已公开表示要拖延一个时期再开始解释工作。据美方国际新闻社十九日报道，美方当局希望让拒绝遣返的美方战俘多等待些时候，以便“减少他们对共产主义的热情”。有消息说，美方有些人甚至主张要等待三十天或更久才开始对战俘进行解释。
    许多消息透露，美方正在秘密地为对不直接遣返的美方战俘的解释工作进行紧张的布置。据国际新闻社报道：美方“解释人员”行踪秘密，一直和外界比较隔绝，新闻记者甚至不能给他们拍照。这些参加美方“解释小组”的军官不久以前已在朝鲜大邱受完两星期的“内容极其秘密的训练”。据路透社十七日报道，为了使美方“解释人员”熟悉对不愿遣返的美方战俘的“进攻之道”，美国参谋长联席会议特地把一个名叫约瑟夫·洛曼的“顾问”用飞机送到朝鲜去给“解释人员”上了一系列的课。这个洛曼是“美国许多城市的警察局顾问”。从他的身分中可以看出，他给美方“解释人员”“讲授”的究竟是什么。
    但是，尽管如此忙碌地进行准备，美方对于能否把拒绝回到反动统治下的美方战俘拉回去，仍然缺乏信心。国际新闻社十九日汶山电引一个美方官员的话说：“我们预料这些人（按指不直接遣返的美方战俘）会真正给我们造成困难”。
