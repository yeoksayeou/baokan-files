    Peasants in the Old Revolutionary Base Areas of Jiangxi Enthusiastically Sell Grain
    Jiulong District of Linshui County, Sichuan Province, Actively Promotes Grain Purchase with Good Results
    The peasants in the old revolutionary base areas of Jiangxi Province are enthusiastically selling surplus grain to the state. Since the early rice harvest in early July, the mountain roads and rivers in the southern old revolutionary base areas of Jiangxi Province have been filled with thousands of peasants carrying grain and wooden boats transporting grain to the grain purchasing stations every day. The daily amount of grain on the market in Xingguo County once reached more than 420,000 jin, setting a record for the highest amount of grain sold in the county's history. By the end of September, the grain sold by farmers in the county to the state had exceeded four times that of previous years. Due to the enthusiastic grain sales by the peasants in the old base areas, the national grain departments in Ruijin, Xingguo, Xunwu, and Yudu counties in the province have all exceeded their original monthly purchase plans. By the end of September, Xingguo County had completed its 1953 annual grain purchase plan ahead of schedule.
    Most of the old revolutionary base areas in Jiangxi Province are mountainous areas. In the past, the grain department did not purchase large quantities due to inconvenient transportation, so some of the farmers' grain could not be sold in time. This year, in order to help the farmers in the old base areas expand reproduction, the Jiangxi Provincial Grain Department improved its grain purchase work. Grain purchasing stations were generally established in these areas, and grain prices were appropriately increased. State-owned trading departments and supply and marketing cooperatives increased the transfer of large quantities of cloth, general merchandise, agricultural tools, and fertilizers while purchasing grain, organized mobile sales teams and peddlers to go deep into the mountainous rural areas to supply a large amount of goods. In order to meet the material needs of farmers after the harvest, many areas also held small-scale material exchange meetings mainly for retail sales in the primary markets adjacent to the grain purchasing stations. These improvements have been warmly welcomed by the peasants in the old base areas and encouraged their enthusiasm for selling grain. After hearing that the state was purchasing large quantities of grain this year, the peasants of Zeng Daosong's mutual aid group in Shangjin Township, Xunwu County, sold all of their 7,700 jin of surplus grain to the nearby grain purchasing station and bought back a batch of safflower seeds (green fertilizer seeds) in preparation for winter planting.
    Now, the late rice in the old revolutionary base areas of Jiangxi Province is about to be harvested. Many farmers said that they will sell more grain to the state after the autumn harvest so that they can purchase means of production for reproduction. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the peasants in Jiulong District, Linshui County, Sichuan Province, have overcome the drought and achieved a bumper harvest. They are now actively selling surplus grain and investing the proceeds from the sale of grain into production, striving for a greater harvest next year.
    According to preliminary statistics, the average yield of rice per mu in Jiulong District, Linshui County, increased by 20 percent compared with last year, and the yield of corn increased by 36 percent. After the bumper harvest, the farmers actively sold surplus grain to purchase agricultural tools and plowing cattle, and invested the funds from the sale of grain into production. According to the statistics of the Jiulong Purchasing Station of Linshui County Grain Company, from August 17th to September 28th, in the thirteen market days, the farmers sold more than 2.08 million jin of yellow rice, with an average of 160,000 jin sold per market day. Because the purchase price of the state-owned grain company is fair and reasonable, the farmers sell yellow rice to the grain company. After selling the grain, in addition to repaying a small portion of the state loan, most of the money is used to purchase agricultural tools, plowing cattle, and daily necessities. According to the statistics of the Jiulong District Office of the People's Bank of China, as of September 28th, the state invested more than 900 million yuan in the Jiulong District market to purchase grain. In addition to the recovery of more than 123 million yuan in agricultural loans, most of the funds in the hands of farmers were invested in the agricultural tool, homespun cloth, and cotton markets. For example, Jiulong Cooperative only sold 12 hoes before August, but increased to 101 hoes in September, the sale of combs increased from 25 in August to 228 in September, an increase of eight times, and the sale of plowshares increased by thirteen times. Homespun cloth and cotton are also selling well in the market. Before August, the turnover of homespun cloth was only 40 to 50 bolts per market day, but in September, the turnover reached 600 bolts, an increase of more than ten times. The turnover of cotton increased from 200 jin per market day in August to 2,000 jin in September, an increase of nine times.
    In the early stage of grain purchase in Jiulong District, due to insufficient publicity, the peasants still had the idea of being reluctant to sell. Seeing that the purchase price was higher than last year, they thought, "The price is high now, and it will rise in the future," and wanted to hold back and sell later; some were afraid that the increased production would increase taxes, and they would not have enough public grain to hand over after selling; some were even afraid of "showing off their wealth" by selling grain, so they only sold five jin when they could sell ten jin. Individual rural cadres were afraid that the peasants would not have enough public grain to hand over after selling, or would "eat and drink heavily," so they used various methods to restrict the peasants from selling grain, such as stipulating that peasants could only sell grain with a certificate from the township government, otherwise they would not be allowed to sell. Due to the peasants' "reluctance to sell" and the cadres' "restriction on sales," the grain purchase work in Jiulong District started very slowly. Jiulong Town is the most affluent area in Jiulong District, but in the five days from August 17th to 22nd, only more than 50,000 jin of grain was collected, and it was all inferior grain. Later, after the party and government leaders and grain agencies, cooperatives and other departments used meetings, blackboards and other ways to vigorously publicize the agricultural tax collection policy and purchase and grain price policies of the People's Government to the peasants, explained that increased production does not increase taxes and how the state takes care of the interests of the peasants when purchasing grain, and that the peasants' sale of grain is to support the significance of the national industrial construction. The peasants' "reluctance to sell" and the cadres' "restriction on sales" gradually disappeared, and the amount of grain sold greatly increased. In Jiulong Town alone, more than 85,000 jin of grain were collected on September 12th, and medium and high-grade grain gradually came on the market. Some farmers calculated that selling 200 jin of grain now can get more than 90,000 yuan, buy a farm tool, buy a pig, and sell the fat pig in the first half of next year, at least you can buy 400 jin of grain, earn both grain and buy fertilizer, and the crops will be better.

    支援国家工业建设、扩大明年农业生产
    江西老革命根据地农民踊跃售粮
    四川邻水县九龙区积极展开宣传购粮成绩好
    江西省老革命根据地的农民踊跃出售余粮给国家。自七月初各地早稻收割以来，纵横在江西省南部老革命根据地的山道和河流上，每天有上千肩挑粮食的农民和载运粮食的木船川流不息地把粮食运到各粮食收购站。兴国县每日粮食上市量曾达四十二万多斤，创该县历年出售粮食的最高纪录。到九月底止，该县农民卖给国家的粮食已超过往年的四倍。由于老根据地农民的踊跃售粮，该省瑞金、兴国、寻邬和雩都等县的国家粮食部门每月的收购数量都突破了原订收购计划，兴国县到九月底就已提前完成了一九五三年的全年购粮计划。
    江西省的老革命根据地大部都是山区，往年粮食部门因为运输不便，没有大量收购，使这里的农民有一部分粮食不能及时卖出。今年江西省粮食部门为了帮助老根据地农民扩大再生产，改进了购粮工作。在这些地区普遍设立了购粮站，并适当提高了粮价。国营贸易部门和供销合作社在收购粮食的同时，增加调运大批布匹、百货和农具、肥料、组织流动推销小组和货郎担深入山区农村大量供应。为了满足农民在丰收后的物资需要，很多地区还在邻近购粮站的初级市场举行了以零售为主的小型物资交流会。这些改进受到老根据地农民的热烈欢迎，鼓励了他们的售粮情绪。寻邬县上津乡曾道松互助组的农民在听到今年国家大量收购粮食后，全组农民把七千七百多斤余粮全部卖给了附近的购粮站，并买回了一批红花籽（绿肥种子）准备冬种。
    现在，江西省老革命根据地的晚稻即将收割，许多农民表示要在秋收后，把更多的粮食卖给国家，以便购进生产资料投入再生产。（新华社）
    四川省邻水县九龙区农民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，战胜了旱灾，获得丰收，现正积极出售余粮，并以售粮所得投入生产，争取明年更大的丰收。
    据初步统计，邻水县九龙区水稻每亩平均比去年增产百分之二十，玉米增产百分之三十六。丰收后的农民们积极出售余粮购置农具耕牛，把售粮所得资金投入生产。据邻水县粮食公司九龙收购点统计，从八月十七日开始到九月二十八日的十三场（赶集）中，农民出售黄谷已达二百零八万余斤，平均每场出售十六万斤。由于国营粮食公司收购牌价公平合理，农民出售黄谷时都把黄谷卖给粮食公司。农民卖出粮食后，除小部分归还国家贷款外，绝大部分用于购买农具、耕牛和生活必需品。据人民银行九龙区办事处统计，到九月二十八日为止，国家投放在九龙区市场收购粮食的资金九亿多元，除农贷收回一亿二千三百多万元外，农民手中的资金大部分都投入农具、土布、棉花市场。如九龙合作社八月份前只销锄头十二把，而九月份增销到一百零一把，抓梳八月销二十五把，九月销到二百二十八把，增加了八倍，犁头销售增加了十三倍。市场上土布、棉花也畅销，土布八月前每场成交不过四、五十匹，到九月份成交即达六百匹，激增十多倍。棉花八月份每场成交二百斤，九月份增加到二千斤，增加九倍。
    九龙区在购粮初期，因宣传不够，农民还有惜售思想，看到收购牌价比去年高，认为“现在价就高，将来还要涨”，想留一步再卖；有的怕增产要增税，卖了交不够公粮；有的甚至怕因卖粮“露富”，所以可卖十斤的只卖五斤。个别乡村干部怕农民卖了交不够公粮或“大吃大喝”，用各种办法限制农民卖粮，例如规定农民只有经乡村政府给证明才准卖粮，否则不准卖。由于农民“惜售”和干部“限售”，九龙区购粮工作开始时进展很慢。九龙镇系九龙区粮源最富足地区，但八月十七到二十二日五天中，仅收粮五万多斤，而且都是下等粮。后来经过党、政领导方面和粮食机构、合作社等部门，运用开会、黑板报等方式，大力向农民宣传了人民政府的农业税征收政策及收购和粮价政策，说明增产不增税和国家收购粮食时如何照顾农民利益以及农民售粮是支援国家工业建设的意义，农民的“惜售”和干部的“限售”思想顾虑才逐渐消除，售粮额因之大大增加。仅九龙镇一地在九月十二日一天就收进谷八万五千多斤，同时中、上等粮也逐渐上市。有的农民算账说：现在卖两百斤谷进九万多元，买件农具买头猪，明年上半年把肥猪卖了至少可买四百斤谷，又赚粮食又购肥料，庄稼就做得更好了。
