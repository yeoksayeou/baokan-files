    As soon as the big exam was over, the students of the Northeast Forestry Institute became active, busily preparing for their mountain internship. Every student was filled with excitement.
    The internship life in the forest area is intense and arduous. Our internship site was in a mountain gully in the Dailing Forest Area. Here, the population is sparse, and more than thirty teachers and students, both male and female, were squeezed into a small shed. In this deep mountain, transportation is of course difficult, and all food and supplies have to be transported uphill by manpower. On the first day, all the male and female students formed a transport team, carrying instruments, luggage, and a month's worth of food and vegetables brought from Harbin to the internship site three kilometers away through muddy and difficult mountain roads.
    The internship began. The students mainly used the Soviet advanced square survey method to carry out the outfield work of the management survey. In the first three days, all the teachers and students together conducted a reconnaissance of the forest zoning, and then divided into groups to carry out forest class zoning and small class zoning, as well as standard land surveys, tree stem analysis and other internship work. Every day, the students took lunch, drinking water, instruments, etc., and went to the vast sea of trees in batches, returning to the驻地 one after another when the sun went down.
    In the dense forest, we often encountered mosquitoes and all kinds of annoying small insects. As soon as we took off our masks and began to measure with all our attention, they launched an attack on us. Some small insects burrowed into our hair, and some bit through our clothes and gloves, which was uncomfortable. If we moved our bodies, it would affect the accuracy of the measurement. However, everyone endured the itching on their faces and bodies and did their internship work well.
    It is in this tense and arduous environment that the students are learning the scientific and technological knowledge of transforming and controlling nature. No difficulty can discourage the students; on the contrary, they find ways to overcome the various difficulties in life. There are also difficulties in business studies, but they are all overcome. If unsolvable problems occur, the students ask the teachers for advice, or discuss them together with several people, and look up reference books. Every night, in the dim candlelight, everyone works hard to study current affairs, or conduct discussions, or sort out materials and write work diaries. Because everyone knows that only in this way can they achieve better learning results.

    在丛山密林中
    赵希宇　陆静英
    大考一结束，东北林学院同学们就活跃起来了，忙着作上山实习前的准备工作。每个同学都怀着兴奋的心情。
    林区的实习生活是紧张、艰苦的。我们的实习地，是在带岭林区的一个山沟里。这里，人烟稀少，老师和男女同学三十多个人，都挤在一间小棚子里。在这深山里，交通当然是困难的，一切食用品，都得靠人力从山下往上运。第一天，全体男女同学组成了一个运送队，通过泥泞难行的山道，从三公里地以外，把由哈尔滨带来的仪器、行李，以及一个月的食粮、菜蔬背往实习地。
    实习开始了。同学们以苏联先进的方格调查法为主，进行了经理调查的外业工作部分。起初三天，全体师生在一起进行了森林区划的踏查，以后便分小组分头进行林班区划及小班区划，以及标准地调查、树干解析等实习工作。每天，同学们带上午饭、饮水、仪器等，分批走向茫茫的树海中去，到太阳下山时才陆续回到驻地。
    密林中我们经常遇到蚊子和种种令人讨厌的小虫。我们一揭开面罩，全神灌注地开始测量的时候，它们就向我们展开了进攻。有些小虫尽往头发里钻，有的虫子隔着衣服、手套咬，令人感到难受，如果身体一动，就会影响到测量的精确性。可是，大家都忍住了脸上和身上的痛痒，做好实习工作。
    同学们就是在这种紧张、艰苦的环境下学习着改造和控制自然的科学技术知识。任何困难，都不能使同学灰心，相反地，他们想法克服了生活上的种种困难。在业务学习上同样是有困难的，但都被克服了。如发生不能解决的问题时，同学们就请教教师，或者几个人在一起讨论，翻参考书。每天晚上，在昏暗的烛光下，大家都努力学习时事，或进行讨论，或整理材料和写工作日记。因为每一个人都知道，只有这样，才会收到更好的学习效果。
