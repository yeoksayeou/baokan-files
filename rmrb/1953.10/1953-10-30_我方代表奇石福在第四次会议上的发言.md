    Speech by Our Representative Qi Shifu at the Fourth Meeting
    In order to facilitate the early convocation of the political conference, the representatives of Korea and China are attending this meeting with the spirit of consultation to discuss and resolve all relevant issues that need to be addressed concerning the political conference. You stated during the first meeting of the bilateral talks that you were willing to resolve the issues with complete sincerity and a reasonable spirit. However, the arrogant and abusive attitude you adopted in the past three days, especially in yesterday's speech, is not at all the attitude of peaceful consultation to resolve issues; it is a deliberate attempt to sabotage the current talks, thereby preventing the early convocation of the political conference.
    In your speech yesterday, you groundlessly brought up the absurd resolution passed illegally by the United Nations General Assembly in February 1951, under the manipulation of the United States government, slandering our side as aggressors. Everyone knows that the United States government single-handedly manufactured and launched the Korean War, and, under the guise of the United Nations, gathered the forces of fifteen other countries to invade Korea. The Korean people launched a struggle of self-defense to protect their homeland. Everyone knows that the United States government invaded China's Taiwan, bombed China's territory, and extended the flames of the war of aggression to the Chinese border, directly threatening China's security. The Chinese people then organized the Volunteer Army to assist the Korean people and resist American aggression. The three years of the Korean War and the two years of armistice negotiations have proven to the people of the world that the war forced upon the Korean and Chinese side was a war of self-defense, and that the consistent position of the Korean and Chinese side is a complete and peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. In your speech full of abuse and slander, we find no "sincerity" or "reasonable spirit." It must be pointed out again that in this bilateral meeting, all issues must be resolved on the basis of reason and consultation. The trick of abuse and slander can have no other effect than hindering the progress of the meeting. If your side is deliberately sabotaging the current talks and has no intention of convening a political conference at all, you should make a clear statement and bear all responsibility for it. Otherwise, you must withdraw this unreasonable attitude of abuse and slander.
    The immediate issue to be resolved in the current bilateral talks is the adoption of the agenda, first discussing and resolving the issue of the membership of neutral nations in the political conference. You refuse to resolve the primary issue of the membership of the political conference, and you oppose the participation of neutral nations in the political conference, but you cannot offer any tenable reasons to support your position. You cannot deny that the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution with an absolute majority to have the Soviet Union, a non-belligerent party, participate in the conference, proving that the vast majority of United Nations member states also agree that the membership of the political conference should not be limited to the belligerent parties. But you attempt to deny that the Soviet Union is a neutral nation outside the belligerent parties. May I ask, is your side currently at war with the Soviet Union? If you are not at war, how can you deny that the Soviet Union is a neutral nation outside the belligerent parties? The Soviet Union has consistently advocated a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and has made multiple efforts to this end, facilitating the Korean armistice negotiations and the realization of the Korean armistice. None of your slanders can negate the fact that the Soviet Union is a neutral nation outside the belligerent parties, nor can it negate the fact that the vast majority of United Nations member states have already agreed that the political conference should have the participation of neutral nations.
    On the one hand, your side openly insults neutral nations, stating: "If we invite neutral nations to participate, the political conference will be turned into an endless debate." On the other hand, you hypocritically claim: "If the Armistice Agreement stipulated that neutral nations attend the political conference, we would be very happy to have them participate, but it does not stipulate this." It must be pointed out that there is no provision in the Armistice Agreement, including paragraph sixty, that can be interpreted as excluding the participation of relevant neutral nations in the political conference; moreover, the various provisions in the Armistice Agreement regarding inviting neutral nations to participate in the work of guaranteeing the stability of the armistice are entirely consistent with the principle of inviting neutral nations to participate in the political conference. As for the arbitrary assertion that the participation of neutral nations in the political conference will turn the political conference into an endless debate, it is not even worth refuting. On the contrary, only with the participation of relevant neutral nations can the conference be guaranteed to proceed in a harmonious atmosphere, thereby promoting the success of the political conference. Because the success or failure of the political conference is related to the peace of Korea and the Far East, it is also closely related to the interests of relevant neutral nations, especially Asian neutral nations, and therefore it is absolutely necessary to invite relevant neutral nations to participate. Since the Armistice Agreement does not exclude the participation of neutral nations in the political conference, and the principle of neutral nations participating in the political conference is fully in line with the spirit of the Armistice Agreement, and the participation of neutral nations is more conducive to the success of the political conference and is absolutely necessary, there is no reason to continue to find excuses in this bilateral meeting to oppose the participation of neutral nations in the political conference. We firmly maintain that the political conference must include the participation of relevant neutral nations. This is our firm and unwavering position.
    In your speech yesterday, you said that our side has shifted from discussing the agenda itself to discussing the substantive issue of neutral nations participating in the political conference. Your side expressed dissatisfaction with this. But in fact, it was your side that first entered the substantive discussion of neutral nations participating in the political conference, putting forward your various untenable arguments against neutral nations participating in the political conference, and therefore our side had to refute them one by one. The current issue is indeed that an agreement should be reached on the agenda first.
    However, the discussions since the start of the bilateral talks have in fact proven that the issue of the membership of the political conference must be discussed and resolved first. We firmly maintain that the two sides immediately list the membership issue as the first item on the agenda of the bilateral talks, and quickly discuss and resolve the issue of the membership of the political conference, in order to facilitate the early convocation of the political conference.
    In your speech just now, you once again unilaterally interpreted paragraph sixty of the Armistice Agreement, and quoted the records of the armistice negotiations out of context to defend your unreasonable position of refusing to discuss and resolve the membership issue first, which is not going to work. No one has denied that the political conference should have the participation of relevant governments of both sides, but nowhere in paragraph sixty of the Armistice Agreement and the negotiation records can be found a basis for excluding neutral nations from participating in the political conference. On the contrary, only with the participation of neutral nations can the political conference smoothly resolve issues such as the Korean issue. You cannot offer any reason to oppose discussing and resolving the issue of the membership of the political conference first. We firmly maintain that our proposed agenda should be adopted, and that substantive discussions should be entered into. Your agenda is unacceptable to us. We ask you to seriously consider our opinions. If you are not prepared to adopt our agenda and begin substantive discussions on the membership issue today, we suggest adjourning the meeting until tomorrow.

### 我方代表奇石福在第四次会议上的发言

    我方代表奇石福在第四次会议上的发言
    为了促成政治会议的早日召开，朝中两国代表出席此次会议，本着协商解决问题的精神，准备讨论和解决一切应予解决的有关政治会议的问题。你在双方会谈的第一次会议中亦曾声称，愿以完全诚意并以合理的精神来解决问题。但你在三天以来，特别是在昨天的发言所采取的骄横谩骂的态度，却完全不是和平协商解决问题的态度；而是有意破坏当前的会谈从而使政治会议无从早日召开。
    你在昨天的发言中，无端地提出了一九五一年二月联合国大会在美国政府操纵之下非法通过的诬蔑我方为侵略者的荒谬决议。谁都知道，是美国政府一手制造和发动了朝鲜战争，并盗用联合国的名义，纠集其他十五个国家的兵力侵略朝鲜，朝鲜人民为保卫自己的祖国，掀起了自卫的斗争。谁都知道，是美国政府侵略中国的台湾，轰炸中国的领土，并将侵略战争的火焰推延到中国的边境，直接威胁中国的安全，中国人民乃组织志愿军援助朝鲜人民，反抗美国的侵略。三年的朝鲜战争和两年的停战谈判，已经向全世界人民证明了：朝中方面被迫进行的乃是自卫的战争，朝中方面所一贯主张的乃是朝鲜问题的彻底和平解决。在你方充满着谩骂与诬蔑的发言中，我们找不到任何的“诚意”和“合理的精神”。必须再次指出，在这次双方会谈中，一切问题都必须在说理和协商的基础上求得解决。谩骂诬蔑的伎俩，除了阻挠会议的进展以外，不可能有任何的作用。如果你方蓄意破坏当前的会谈，根本无意召开政治会议，你方就应该明确作出声明，并担负其一切责任。否则，你方就必须撤回这种谩骂诬蔑的无理态度。
    当前双方会谈中，所必须立即解决的问题是通过议程，首先讨论和解决中立国参加政治会议的成员问题。你们拒绝解决政治会议成员的首要的问题，反对中立国参加政治会议，但你们提不出任何站得住的理由来支持你们的立场。你们不能否认，联合国大会以绝对的多数通过了把非交战双方之一的苏联参加会议的决议，证明了联合国会员国的绝大多数也同意政治会议的成员不应限于交战双方。但你们却妄图否认苏联为交战双方以外的中立国家。试问你方现在是否与苏联处于交战的状态？如果不是处于交战状态，则你方如何能够否认苏联为交战双方以外的中立国家？苏联一贯主张和平解决朝鲜问题，并为此作了多次的努力，促成了朝鲜停战谈判和朝鲜停战的实现。你方任何的诬蔑都不能否定苏联是交战双方以外的中立国家的事实，也不能否定联合国绝大多数的会员国也已经同意了政治会议应有中立国参加的事实。
    你方一面公然侮辱中立国家，声称：“假如我们邀请中立国家参加，政治会议会被变成一个无休止的辩论会”；另一方面又假惺惺地声称：“假如停战协定规定中立国出席政治会议，我们将很高兴有他们参加，但它无此规定。”必须指出，停战协定中没有任何规定包括第六十款在内，可以被解释为排除有关中立国家参加政治会议；而且，停战协定中关于邀请中立国家参加保证停战稳定的工作的各项规定，与邀请中立国家参加政治会议的原则是完全一致的。至于所谓中立国家参加政治会议将使政治会议变为无休止的辩论会的武断论调，更是不值一驳的。正好相反，唯有在有关中立国家参加政治会议的情况下，才能保证会议得以在和谐的气氛下进行，从而促成政治会议的成功。由于政治会议的成败关系着朝鲜与远东的和平，因而也密切地关系着有关中立国家特别是亚洲中立国家的利益，因此也就有完全的必要邀请有关中立国家参加。既然停战协定并不排除中立国家参加政治会议，而中立国家参加政治会议的原则完全符合于停战协定的精神，而且中立国家的参加更有助于政治会议的成功并有其完全的必要，就没有任何理由在这次双方会谈中继续寻找藉口，反对中立国家参加政治会议。我们坚决主张政治会议必须包括有关中立国家参加。这是我方坚定不移的立场。
    你在昨天的发言中说，我方已从讨论议程的本身转而进入了讨论中立国家参加政治会议的实质的问题。你方并对此表示不满。但事实上是你方首先进入中立国家参加政治会议的实质讨论，提出了你方反对中立国家参加政治会议的各项站不住的论点，因而我方不能不逐条予以驳斥。当前的问题的确是应该首先对于议程达成协议。
    但双方会谈开始以来的讨论，事实上已经证明了政治会议的成员问题必须首先予以讨论和解决。我们坚决主张双方立即把成员问题列为双方会谈的第一项议程，迅速讨论和解决政治会议的成员问题，以利于政治会议的早日召开。
    你在刚才的发言中又一次片面地解释了停战协定第六十款，并且断章取义地引用停战谈判的记录来为你方拒绝首先讨论并解决成员问题的无理立场辩护，这是行不通的。谁也没有否认政治会议要有双方有关政府参加，但停战协定第六十款和谈判记录的任何地方都找不出政治会议应该排除中立国家参加的根据。相反地，只有在中立国家参加的情况下，政治会议才能顺利地解决朝鲜问题等问题。你们提不出任何理由反对首先讨论并解决政治会议的成员问题。我们坚决主张通过我方所提出的议程，并进入实质问题的讨论。你们的议程是我们所不能接受的。我们要求你们郑重考虑我们的意见。如果你们今天还不准备通过我们的议程、开始关于成员问题的实质讨论，我们建议休会到明天。
