The Laiyang County Thirteenth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (hereinafter referred to as the District Committee) convened a meeting of grassroots cooperative cadres on August 23rd to review shortcomings in grain procurement and material supply work, and to analyze the specific purchasing and selling demands of farmers. They created a method of sending mobile sales teams to the countryside, centered on grain procurement, and integrating procurement, supply, and other aspects of work, which was well received by farmers. Their experiences are as follows:

I. Under the unified leadership, unified planning, and unified organization of the Party, cadres from the district, township, bank, and cooperative closely cooperated. Under the leadership of the District Committee, based on the number and strength of cadres in each grassroots cooperative, and the size and proximity of villages, the two joint-village cooperatives in the district and their subordinate distribution points were organized into five mobile sales teams, each with three to five cooperative cadres, led by the cooperative director or manager. Wherever the mobile sales team went, they worked closely with the district and township cadres, conducting discussions in mutual aid teams and at various meetings, focusing on the central issue of increasing agricultural yields. They also cultivated exemplary models of selling surplus grain, etc., on a group or household basis, playing a demonstrative role among the peasant masses. When the mobile sales team carried out purchasing and selling work, the district and township cadres actively assisted, mainly by educating the farmers about grain sales, closely integrating political work with economic work.

II. Procurement, supply, credit, encouraging savings, and technical guidance were combined. When the mobile sales team went to villages to promote sales, they displayed goods on the streets, allowing farmers to choose and purchase. For means of production that farmers were not accustomed to using but were indeed beneficial to production, they explained the functions, compared the benefits, and taught the techniques to the peasant masses, so that farmers knew that buying them would be useful and they would voluntarily purchase them. For example, the masses in Xixiaobu Village were initially not accustomed to using cottonseed cake, fearing that it would not be as effective as soybean cake. After explaining the actual product and comparing the benefits, more than 700 jin were sold in one afternoon. Some people said, "Doing it this way, we can rest assured when we buy things to take home, it's useful, and it won't be wasted."

In transactions, the mobile sales team, in order to take care of the farmers' busy production schedule and lack of time to go to market, also adopted a transaction method based on exchanging grain for goods, supplemented by buying goods with money. Initially, when this type of transaction was carried out, some farmers, influenced by private merchants raising prices and rushing to buy grain, thought that the mobile sales team's grain prices were low and were unwilling to sell. After the mobile sales team and district and township cadres, starting from the vital interests of the masses, patiently educated the masses about price policies using methods of accounting and comparison, and calculating the ratio of the goods the masses wanted to buy to the grain price, it was proven that the state's grain price was reasonable and that the masses would not suffer losses by exchanging grain for goods, and that they would save time by not going to market and delaying production. During the publicity, they also combined it with education on patriotism and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, explaining that selling grain to the state was supporting national construction, a glorious patriotic action, which was beneficial to both the country and themselves. In this way, the masses quickly calculated the benefits and actively sold wheat to exchange for what they needed. For example, the masses in Xixiaobu Village, in buying soybean cake, calculated that buying 100 jin of state-owned soybean cake would save 35,000 yuan, but selling 100 jin of wheat to unscrupulous private merchants who raised prices to buy would only bring in 20,000 yuan, resulting in a loss of 15,000 yuan for the farmers. Farmer Chen Zaofang, after exchanging 145 jin of wheat for 148 jin of cottonseed cake and some fertilizer, said: "In the past, I never calculated the benefits, only seeing the advantage of selling grain to private merchants, and not seeing the disadvantage. Now I understand that transacting with the state is fair, beneficial to myself, and beneficial to the country."

When the mobile sales team carried out purchasing and selling business, they also paid attention to individual households in difficulty who needed to buy means of production but had no money or grain. For such households in difficulty, loans were given on the spot after research by the bank, district, and township cadres. As for farmers with surplus grain, they were mobilized to save grain through village cadres. As long as the reasons were explained to the masses and the procedures were clarified, the masses could easily accept it. In Xixiaobu Village alone, after mobilization by cadres, more than 3,200 jin of wheat were saved. The masses' response to saving grain was: "Saving grain with the state is reliable in preserving capital and quality."

III. On the basis of taking care of the interests of cooperative members, unite non-members, develop new members, to expand the influence of the cooperative. Non-member farmers in Qiandabu Village were unwilling to buy things from the cooperative, fearing that the cooperative would not do business with non-members, but at the same time they saw that cooperative members bought things cheaper, so they had a desire to join the cooperative. In this situation, the cooperative appropriately took care of the non-member masses, and encouraged them to join the cooperative, uniting them around the cooperative. As a result, eight farmers in the village joined the cooperative in one evening.

The above experience proves that the practice of centering on grain procurement and combining procurement, sales, and other aspects of work, as well as close cooperation between cooperatives, banks, and district, township (village) cadres, is not only supported by the masses, but also makes it easy to complete the grain procurement task. The masses generally reflected: "This approach of the cooperative is really beneficial to us, it is convenient, saves labor, and can teach technology face to face. It's a pity it came a little late. If it had come earlier, we would have bought more things and the state would have procured more wheat." Farmer Chi Zhongkui said: "When the cooperative didn't come, we were so busy that we didn't even have time to sell grain even if we had it. Now that the cooperative has come, the grain is sold and the things are bought, which is really convenient. If the cooperative can do this more often, it can save us a lot of work every year."

    山东省莱阳县十三区供销合作社流动营业组收购粮食的经验
    王文光  薛德纯
    中共莱阳县十三区委会（以下简称区委）于八月二十三日召开基层合作社干部会议，检查了粮食收购和物资供应工作中的缺点，并分析了当前农民购销要求的具体情况，创造了流动营业组下乡，以收购粮食为中心，实行收购、供应等多方面工作相结合的工作方法，深受农民欢迎。他们的经验如下：
    一、在党的统一领导、统一计划、统一组织下，区、乡、银行、合作社干部密切结合。在区委领导下，根据各个基层合作社干部的多少、强弱，以及村庄大小、远近，将全区两个联村社及其所辖的分销点组成五个流动营业组，每组有合作社干部三至五人，由合作社主任或经理任组长。流动营业组到那里，就和那里的区、乡干部紧密配合行动，在互助组里和各种会议上，进行以增加农业收获量为中心问题的酝酿，并以组或户为单位培养出售余粮等各种典型，在农民群众中起示范作用。当流动营业组展开购销工作时，区、乡干部就积极帮助，主要是向农民进行售粮教育，使政治工作与经济工作紧密地结合起来。
    二、收购、供销、信贷、存实以及技术指导等工作结合进行。当流动营业组到村推销时，将货物摆在街上，任农民群众选购。对群众不习惯使用而确实有利于生产的生产资料，则向农民群众讲作用、比利益、教技术，使农民知道买回去管用而自愿采购。如西小埠村的群众起初对用棉子饼不习惯，怕不如豆饼管用，经过实物讲解和比利益以后，一晌午工夫即卖了七百多斤。有的群众说：“这样办，咱买东西回家去才放心，管用，糟蹋不了。”
    在交易中，流动营业组为了照顾农民生产忙，没时间赶集，还采用了以粮换货为主、辅以用钱买货的交易方式。起初进行这种交易时，有些农民因受私商抬价抢购粮食的影响，以为流动营业组给的粮价低，不愿出售，经过流动营业组和区、乡干部从群众的切身利益出发，用算账对比的方法，耐心向群众进行价格政策的教育，根据群众要买的东西和粮价的比价计算，证明国家粮价合理和以粮换货群众不吃亏，且省得赶集耽误了生产。在宣传时，并结合进行爱国主义和巩固工农联盟的教育，说明把粮食买给国家，就是支援国家建设，是光荣的爱国行动，对国家对自己都有好处。这样，群众就很快地算过账来，踊跃卖出小麦去换取自己所需要的东西。如西小埠村的群众在买豆饼中，算了算买国家的豆饼一百斤就可省三万五千元，但一百斤小麦如卖给抬价抢购的不法私商才多二万元，结果农民还要吃亏一万五千元。农民陈早芳用一百四十五斤小麦换了一百四十八斤棉子饼及一部分肥田粉后说：“过去我没算过账，光看见把粮卖给私商沾便宜的这面，没看见吃亏的那面，这回明白了，和国家交易公道，对自己有利，对国家有利。”
    流动营业组在开展购销业务时，还注意到个别没钱没粮而需要购买生产资料的困难户，对这样的困难户就地经过银行、区、乡干部的研究给予贷款扶持。至于对有余粮的农民，则通过村干部动员存实。只要和群众讲明道理，弄清手续，群众就容易接受。仅西小埠村经过干部动员后，小麦存实即有三千二百多斤。群众对存实的反映是：“把粮存给国家，保本、保色（成色）真牢靠。”
    三、在照顾社员利益基础上，团结非社员，发展新社员，以扩大合作社影响。前大埠村的非社员农民不愿到合作社买东西，怕合作社不做非社员买卖，但同时又看到了社员买东西便宜，于是产生了想入股的要求。在这种情况下，合作社即适当地照顾了非社员群众，并启发他们入股，把他们团结在合作社周围，于是全村在一个晚上就有八个农民加入了合作社。
    从以上经验证明：以粮食收购为中心，实行收购、供销等多方面工作相结合的做法，以及合作社、银行及区、乡（村）干部密切配合，不但受到群众拥护，并且容易完成粮食收购任务。群众普遍反映：“合作社这种做法对咱们真有利，又便利、又省工、又能当面教技术。可惜来晚了一点，如果来早点，咱们买的东西还要多，国家收购的小麦也要多些。”农民迟中奎说：“合作社没来时，咱忙得有粮都没空粜，合作社来了，粮粜了，东西也买了，真方便。如果合作社能多多这么干，一年可给咱们省好多工。”
