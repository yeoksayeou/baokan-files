Guizhou Province Vigorously Helps Ethnic Minorities Develop Production

    This year, under the leadership and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the farmers of the Miao, Buyi, Yi, Hui, and Shui ethnic minorities in Guizhou Province overcame severe natural disasters and initially changed the primitive production methods of "slash-and-burn cultivation" and "extensive planting with low yields," achieving a general bumper harvest. Currently, most of the corn in the ethnic minority areas has been harvested; the rice harvest has begun in Ceheng, Wangmo, Liping, Tianzhu, Luodian, and other counties where the Buyi and Shui ethnic minorities live, as well as in the Miao Autonomous Regions of Taijiang and Lushan, deep in the Miaoling Mountains, the heartland of the Miao people. This year's rice is generally expected to increase production by 8%, with some areas increasing by 10% to 20%.

    Since the spring plowing this year, Party and government departments at all levels in Guizhou Province have gradually strengthened the leadership of production in ethnic minority areas. In May, after the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee issued the "Instructions to Party Committees at All Levels on Agricultural Production in Mountainous and Ethnic Minority Areas," the Guizhou Provincial People's Government and the Party and government leading departments of the prefectures and counties organized working groups to go deep into the remote mountainous areas and ethnic minority areas, leading farmers to fight against drought, insect, and frost disasters. At the beginning of rice transplanting, severe hail and wind disasters were overcome in the ninety districts of thirty-four counties, laying a good foundation for rice growth. At the end of June, the drought reappeared, especially in the remote mountainous areas of ethnic minorities, which are located in high and cold areas, making water sources even scarcer. Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, farmers of all ethnic groups, on the one hand, vigorously built small-scale water conservancy projects according to the specific situation of the scattered and fragmented mountain fields, and on the other hand, looked for water sources and used waterwheels and manual water scoops to transplant rice. During this period, according to incomplete statistics from only twenty-one remote mountainous ethnic minority areas such as Libo and Luodian, more than 3,000 small-scale water conservancy projects were built, ensuring irrigation for 156,600 mu of rice fields. In late July, insect and animal plagues occurred in more than 20 counties including Duyun. The People's Government immediately sent technical cadres to lead ethnic minorities in using indigenous methods and medicines and equipment, combined with weeding and hoeing, to eliminate pests. The Miao, Yi, and Shui farmers in Sandu, Liping, Lushan, Weining, and other counties, while fighting against drought and insect plagues, also used methods such as burning fires and setting up sentry posts, driving away wild animals and hunting to protect crops with weapons.

    In order to help ethnic minority farmers develop production, the Guizhou Provincial People's Government has increased the various agricultural loans issued this year by four times compared to last year. Various agricultural loans totaling 19.2245 billion yuan were issued in only twenty-eight counties with a relatively large number of ethnic minorities, such as Lushan and Liping. Before and after the spring plowing, the province also focused on distributing 255,000 pieces of free agricultural implements in seventy-two counties inhabited by concentrated and scattered ethnic minorities, benefiting more than 150,000 poor ethnic minority farmers who had historically engaged in "slash-and-burn cultivation" or lacked iron agricultural implements. Local People's Banks also cooperated in issuing loans for nearly 100,000 head of draft cattle, solving the difficulty of lacking animal power in changing "slash-and-burn cultivation." The province held 95 material exchange meetings in ethnic minority areas, combining them with ethnic festivals, with a transaction volume of 8.075 billion yuan. Ethnic trade stores and cooperatives in various ethnic minority autonomous regions and areas also vigorously purchased local and special products from ethnic minorities and supplied various means of production and living. Due to the vigorous support of the People's Government and the distribution of free agricultural implements, the productivity of the remote mountainous areas of ethnic minorities has been greatly improved, with production efficiency generally doubling; farming techniques and production methods have also been initially improved. This year, most of the ethnic minority farmers in the remote mountainous areas of the province have achieved two plowings and two harrowings, weeding and fertilizing. Ethnic minority farmers in areas with better production conditions in the past have also generally tried topdressing, and the amount of fertilizer applied this year has increased by one-third to one-half compared with last year.

    贵州省大力帮助少数民族发展生产
    贵州省苗、布依、彝、回、水家等少数民族农民，今年在中国共产党和人民政府领导、扶助下，战胜了严重的自然灾害，初步改变了“刀耕火种”、“广种薄收”的原始生产方式，普遍获得丰收。目前，各少数民族地区的苞谷已大部收割完毕；布依、水家等少数民族人民聚居的册亨、望谟、黎平、天柱、罗甸等县，苗族聚居腹地——苗岭山脉深山里的台江、炉山等苗族自治区都已开始收割水稻。今年的水稻，一般可望增产百分之八，有的增产达一成至二成。
    今年春耕以来，贵州省各级党政部门，逐渐加强了少数民族地区的生产领导工作。五月，中共贵州省委发出“关于山区及少数民族地区农业生产给各级党委的指示”后，贵州省人民政府和专区、县党政领导部门，即组织工作组深入边沿山区和少数民族聚居地区，领导农民向旱、虫、冻灾进行斗争。插秧开始时，在三十四个县的九十个区的范围内战胜了严重的雹灾、风灾，给水稻生长打下良好基础。六月底，旱象再度来临，特别是少数民族边沿山区，由于地处高寒，水源更感缺乏。各族农民在党和人民政府领导下，一面根据山区田土分散零星的具体情况，大力兴修小型水利，一面则寻找水源，车水、戽水插秧。这段时期中，仅荔波、罗甸等二十一个少数民族边沿山区不完全的统计，即兴修了小型水利三千余处，保证了十五万六千六百余亩稻田得到灌溉。七月下旬，都匀等二十余县，又普遍发生了虫灾、兽灾，人民政府立即派出技术干部，领导少数民族使用土法和药械，结合薅秧锄草扑灭虫害。三都、黎平、炉山、威宁等县的苗族、彝族、水家农民、在战胜旱、虫灾的同时，又用烧火放哨，赶山打猎的办法，追捕野兽，武装保卫庄稼。
    贵州省人民政府为了帮助少数民族农民发展生产，今年发放的各种农业贷款，较去年增加了四倍。仅在炉山、黎平等二十八个少数民族较多的县份，即发放了各种农业贷款一百九十二亿二千四百五十万元。春耕前后，全省并有重点地在七十二个少数民族聚居和散居的县份，发放了二十五万五千件无偿农具，使十五万余户过去历来“刀耕火种”或缺乏铁制农具的少数民族的贫苦农民，得到了铁制农具。各地人民银行又配合发放了近十万头耕牛贷款，解决了改变“刀耕火种”中缺乏畜力的困难。全省在少数民族聚居地区，结合民族节日，先后举行九十五次物资交流会，成交额达八十亿七千五百万元。各少数民族自治区和聚居区的民族贸易商店和合作社，也都大力收购了少数民族的土、特产品，并供应各种生产和生活资料。由于人民政府的大力扶助和无偿农具的发放，大大提高了少数民族边沿山区的生产力，生产效率普遍提高了一倍；耕作技术和生产方法也初步得到提高和改进。全省边沿山区的少数民族农民，今年大部做到了二犁二耙，薅秧、施肥，过去生产条件较好地区的少数民族农民，还普遍试施了追肥，今年施肥量较去年增加了三分之一至二分之一。    （绍宾）
