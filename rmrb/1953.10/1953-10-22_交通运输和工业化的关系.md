    The Relationship Between Transportation and Industrialization
    Han Tuofu
    Transportation is an important condition for consolidating national defense and promoting political and cultural development, and it is also a very important link in the national economy. Transportation is directly involved in the scope of production, distribution, circulation, and consumption. Without transportation, products would be difficult to move to consumers, and the production process could not be carried out cyclically and continuously expanded. Therefore, product transportation is regarded as a continuation of the production process. Under the conditions of commodity production, freight is added as part of the absolute value and is a factor constituting the cost of the product. Therefore, although transportation does not change the nature of nature, but changes the location of matter or people, it is indispensable to social life and to the national economy. In the total circulation cost of Soviet state-owned trading organizations, freight accounts for more than 20%, and the freight of supply and marketing organizations in various economic departments accounts for 70% of the total circulation cost. As for the value of raw materials, fuels, and some finished products required for production and operation, the proportion of freight is also very large. For example, in the Soviet Union, transporting one ton of coal to a place 2,000 kilometers away costs the same as the production cost of one ton of coal. It can be seen that product transportation based on transportation conditions affects production and consumption through value composition, and thereby affects the development of the national economy.

    During the economic recovery period, transportation played a huge role in promoting the production and exchange of industry and agriculture. As Lenin said when formulating the economic recovery plan for the young Soviet Republic: "We should restore the turnover of agriculture and industry. To restore this turnover, there must be material support. What is the material support that connects industry and agriculture? It is railway transportation and water transportation." [1] In China's economic recovery process, transportation has also played a significant role in promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. In the past four years, China has repaired and built more than 24,000 kilometers of railways and approximately 130,000 kilometers of highways. It has dredged major waterways such as the Yangtze River, the Pearl River, and the Songhua River, restored the work of major seaports, and rebuilt Huangpu Port and Tanggu New Port. Due to the restoration and development of these transportation means, we have promoted the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, between major administrative regions, between provinces and localities, and between domestic and international areas, and thereby promoted the recovery and development of industry and agriculture. Without such large-scale restoration and construction of transportation means and transportation tools, it would have been impossible for China's industry and agriculture to recover and develop so rapidly in the past four years.

    Currently, China has entered a period of large-scale economic construction, and gradually realizing national industrialization is a serious task. In the process of gradual industrialization in the future, the transportation industry will undoubtedly play a huge role. Because first, if we want to carry out industrialization, we must engage in many industrial infrastructure projects, which requires a large number of machines, equipment, materials, and workers' living materials to ensure the completion of the projects. If there are no convenient transportation means and transportation tools, then the large amount of materials required for these infrastructure projects cannot be supplied in time, factories will be difficult to expand, and new factories cannot be built. Second, even if factories are expanded and new factories are built, if there are not enough transportation tools to transport materials and raw materials in time, then factories will often stop work waiting for materials, and even cannot start work. Third, even if factories can produce a large number of industrial products, if there is no convenient transportation system and tools to send these industrial products to consumers, then factories cannot regularly carry out reproduction and expanded reproduction. Comrade Stalin pointed out in his report to the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "...Commodities are, after all, not produced for production's sake, but for consumption's sake. We have had such a fact that there were originally many industrial products and agricultural products, but these products not only did not reach the hands of consumers, but instead wandered for years on the bureaucratic roundabout roads, the so-called commodity transfer network, and could not meet consumers. It is obvious that under such conditions, industry and agriculture lose any incentive to expand production, the commodity transfer network is piled up with goods, while the workers and peasants end up without industrial products and agricultural products. As a result, although there are large quantities of industrial products and agricultural products, the national economic life is still in disintegration." [2] It can be seen that between various industrial bases, between various industrial departments, and between various industrial centers and agricultural areas, without a corresponding transportation network, it is completely impossible to carry out industrial construction. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the Soviet Union's "area exceeds that of any country in the world, including Britain, which owns colonies (excluding autonomous territories). The existence and development of such a country is unimaginable without a well-arranged railway transport that integrates the vast areas of the country into a national whole; for the national economy, its development is impossible without a properly arranged railway transport that connects industrial bases with agricultural areas that supply them with raw materials and food and combines them into an economic whole." [3] China's territory is also very large, and without a sound transportation system, it is impossible to achieve industrialization.

    However, transportation not only plays an active role in industrialization in terms of material transportation, but also has great significance for the accumulation of national funds. Everyone knows that China's industrialization funds mainly rely on savings and the accumulation of state-owned enterprises. If transportation conditions are convenient and transportation is reasonable, which can shorten the average freight distance between the production place and the consumption place, accelerate the turnover of products, and save material resources, then freight can be greatly reduced, and the cost of infrastructure construction, the ex-factory price of products, and retail prices can also be reduced, and the accumulation of funds can add new sources.

    The above is only in terms of the direct relationship between transportation and industrialization. But if we further observe from a rigorous scientific point of view, then transportation itself is also an independent production sector, which can be parallel with industry, agriculture, etc. Marx pointed out in "Theories of Surplus Value": "In addition to mining, agriculture, and industry, there is a fourth material production sector, which will also go through three different stages of handicraft operation, manufacturing operation, and mechanical operation. That is the transportation industry, which is either transporting people or transporting goods." [4] The main difference between transportation production and industrial and agricultural production is that in the process of realizing transportation, labor acts on the means of labor, not on the object of labor. Therefore, the transportation industry must be adapted to industrial development, otherwise it will hinder industrial development. However, it must be emphasized here that industry is, after all, the cornerstone of the national economy, and without a highly developed industrial foundation, it is impossible to carry out technological transformation of transportation means and transportation tools.

    From the above, the relationship between transportation and industrialization is very close.

    China's transportation industry includes railways and railway transportation, highways and highway transportation, river and sea channels and river and sea transportation, as well as aviation transportation, postal and telecommunications and other departments.

    Railway transportation is of particular importance to industry. For more than three years, the total volume of railway transportation in China has accounted for about 90% of modern transportation. The advantage of this type of transportation is that it has a large volume and is relatively safe and accurate. It plays a leading role in long-distance transportation between industrial centers and important cities. However, its disadvantage is that the construction cost is expensive, and the freight is higher than that of sea and river transportation. China currently has only more than 20,000 kilometers of railways, and it is necessary to continue to build them in the future. This year, railways have taken the first place in the entire transportation investment, which shows that we have paid great attention to the development of railways.

    Sea and river transportation is mostly determined by natural conditions. China has a long coastline and many rivers, all of which are convenient for navigation except the Yellow River. In addition, this type of transportation has a large volume and low cost, and it should occupy a very important position in the transportation of industrial and agricultural products. This year, because railway transportation is close to saturation, there is a phenomenon of more goods than ships in coastal and inland river transportation. Inland rivers have learned the Soviet Union's train-style towing method, so that backward wooden sailing ships can also play a major transportation role, especially in the transportation of small quantities of products over short distances.

    Highways and automobile transportation are also of great significance to our continental country. The advantages of automobile transportation are flexibility, speed, and convenient loading and unloading. The main disadvantages are small volume and high cost. The main difference between automobile, railway, and water transportation is that the former is area transportation, and the latter is line transportation. Automobile transportation can penetrate into every corner of the countryside and is an important tool for the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.

    Air transportation has also begun to be established. This is specially used for the express transportation of passengers and valuable goods, as well as the delivery of long-distance mail, but it is still in its infancy and cannot be universally developed immediately.

    As a tool for transmitting letters and communication, postal and telecommunications is a special department of transportation. It generally cannot change the location of products or people, but it also plays a certain role in the development of industrial and agricultural production.

    Finally, there are a large number of backward transportation tools. Due to China's vast land, abundant resources, and large population, there is a great lack of modern transportation tools. The transportation on the vast countryside and sea and river surfaces must still rely on backward local transportation tools. At present, there are nearly 40,000 tons of wooden sailing ships and millions of mule and horse carts, as well as other various folk transportation tools, scattered in every corner of the country. The transportation volume of this backward tool is very considerable. For example, the ton-mileage of wooden sailing ships last year exceeded the ton-mileage of inland river transportation by nearly two times, which must be well utilized.

    The situation of China's various transportation methods and their role in industrialization are roughly as described above.

    In order for China's transportation industry to play a role in promoting industrialization, it is necessary to strengthen the infrastructure construction of the transportation industry and strive to use new-style transportation tools in order to achieve the degree of both economy and effectiveness. Under the general goal of concentrating major efforts on building the country's heavy industry, China's first five-year plan stipulates that the transportation industry must be developed accordingly, and the state's investment in transportation infrastructure construction is very large. However, due to China's technological backwardness and the lack of technical cadres, many transportation engineering projects have experienced large waste and low quality. Therefore, in the future, we must strengthen the study of the Soviet Union's advanced experience and improve the quality of engineering in order to ensure that transportation construction does not lag behind industrial construction and does not hinder the speed of industrialization. But the most important issue is to strengthen the leadership of transportation in order to give full play to the effectiveness of transportation. Otherwise, even if we have the main transportation means and transportation tools, we still cannot keep up with the needs of industrial construction. Many leading cadres still have a bureaucratic style of not studying their business, which needs to be corrected.

    In strengthening the leadership of the transportation sector, the most important thing is to strengthen the Party's leadership in the transportation sector. Comrade Malenkov emphasized in his report to the 18th Conference of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1941: "Party organizations should regularly study the work of industrial enterprises and railways, understand their needs, and help economic organs with the daily leadership of industry and transportation." [5] China's current transportation industry is still very scattered and backward. Therefore, strengthening the leadership of local Party organizations over the local transportation industry is of great significance. The local Party organizations' leadership over state-owned transportation enterprises must pay attention to giving play to their socialist superiority. Not only should they be required to improve business management, strive to reduce costs, and increase accumulation for the country, but more importantly, they should be required to serve industrial and agricultural production and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas under the unified leadership of the Central Committee, first of all to serve the country's industrialization.

    Regarding the leadership of private transportation enterprises, it should be fully recognized that at present, private ownership still accounts for a considerable proportion in some transportation sectors. For example, the number of private cars is twice that of public cars, and private shipping accounts for a large proportion. As for other large numbers of backward transportation tools, most of them are privately owned. Therefore, we must strengthen the leadership and management of the state-owned economy over the private transportation industry, implement the policy of taking into account both public and private interests, and give play to its transportation potential, so that it becomes a transportation industry that is more conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood. On the other hand, for the private shipping industry at sea and on major inland rivers, under the principle of voluntary participation by the owners, we must adopt a step-by-step, prepared, and differentiated policy of joint public-private ownership, so as to bring the private transportation industry into the orbit of national planning, serve China's industrialization and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, which is not only beneficial to the country, but also promotes the development of the private transportation industry. The fact that the Minsheng Shipping Company has greatly developed its business since the joint public-private ownership proves that state capitalist transportation enterprises have significant advantages over general private capitalist transportation enterprises.

    The leadership of local transportation work must be continuously improved and strengthened. It is necessary to give full play to the potential capabilities of backward transportation tools, so that it can truly become a powerful assistant to trunk line transportation, can serve industrial construction and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and meet the needs of local people.

    We believe that strengthening the leadership of Party organizations at all levels over the transportation sector will definitely enable the quality of China's transportation work to be continuously improved and promote the realization of national industrialization.

    交通运输和工业化的关系
    韩托夫
    交通运输，是巩固国防和促进政治文化发展的重要条件，同时又是国民经济中一个很重要的环节。交通运输是直接涉及生产、分配、流通和消费范围的。不通过交通运输，产品就难于运转到消费者手中，生产过程就不可能周而复始地进行和不断地扩大，因此，产品运输是当作生产过程的继续，而在商品生产的条件下，运费则是当作绝对价值量的一部分而追加上去，是构成产品成本的一个因素。所以交通运输虽然并不改变自然的性质，而是改变物质或人的位置，但它对于社会生活，对于国民经济是不可缺少的。在苏联国营贸易机关的全部流通费中，运费占百分之二十以上，各经济部门的供销机关的运费竟占全部流通费的百分之七十，至于原料、燃料的价值和生产经营上所需要的一些成品价值中，运费的比重也是很大的。例如苏联把每吨煤炭运输到两千公里远的地方，运费就等于每吨煤炭的生产成本。由此可见，根据交通条件而进行的产品运输，是通过价值构成而影响到生产和消费，并由此而影响到国民经济的发展的。
    在经济恢复时期，交通运输对于促进工农业的生产和交流是具有巨大意义的。正如列宁在制定年青的苏维埃共和国的经济恢复计划时所说：“我们应当恢复农业与工业底周转，为了恢复这种周转，就必需有物质的支柱。联系工农业的物质支柱是什么呢？这就是铁道运输和水路运输。”〔一〕我国在经济恢复过程中，交通运输对于促进工农业生产的发展和城乡物资的交流，也是起着很大的作用的。在过去四年中，我国曾修复和新建二万四千余公里的铁道，约十三万公里的公路，曾修浚长江、珠江和松花江等主要航道，恢复了各主要海港的工作，并改建了黄浦港和塘沽新港。由于这些交通手段的恢复和发展，我们就促进了城乡间，各大行政区间，各省和地方间，国内与国际间的物资交流，并借此而促进了工农业的恢复和发展，如果没有这样大规模的交通手段和运输工具的恢复和建设，那末，四年来我国工农业是不可能有这样迅速地恢复和发展的。
    目前，我国已进入大规模经济建设时期，逐步实现国家工业化是一个严重的任务。在今后逐步工业化的过程中，交通运输业，毫无疑义地，也将起着巨大的作用。因为第一、我们要进行工业化，就要从事许多工业基本建设，这就要大量的机器、装备、材料和工人的生活资料，来保证工程的完成。假如没有便当的交通手段和运输工具，那么，这些基本建设所需要的大量物资就不能及时供应，工厂就难于扩大，新工厂也不能建造起来了。第二、就是工厂扩大了，新工厂建立起来了，假如没有充分的运输工具及时地运送材料和原料，那末，工厂也会常常停工待料、以至不能开工。第三、即使工厂能生产出大量的工业品，假如没有便利的运输系统和工具，把这些工业产品送到消费者的手中，那末，工厂也不能经常地进行再生产和扩大再生产。斯大林同志在联共第十七次代表大会的报告中曾指出：“……商品毕竟不是为生产而生产，而是为消费而生产的。我们有过这样一种事实，就是工业品和农产品本来不少，但这些产品不仅没有达到消费者手上，反而积年徘徊于官僚主义的迂回曲折的路上，即所谓商品转运网中，而不能与消费者见面。很明显的，在这种条件下，工业和农业就失去其扩展生产的任何刺激，商品转运网就堆满货物，而工农群众却落得没有工业品和农产品。结果，虽有大宗工业品和农产品，而全国经济生活还是陷于解体。”〔二〕由此可见，在各工业基地之间，各工业部门之间，各工业中心与各农业地区之间，假如没有相适应的交通运输网，要进行工业建设是完全不可能的。斯大林同志曾指出，苏联的“面积，是超过世界上任何国家的，其中包括拥有殖民地的英国（自治领不算在内）。这样的国家，如果没有安排得很好的、把全国广大地区结成国家的整体的铁路运输，其存在和发展是不可想像的；对于国民经济来说，如果没有布置适宜的、把工业基地跟供给其原料和粮食的农业地区联系起来并将它们结合成一个经济整体的铁路运输，其发展是不可能的。”〔三〕我国的领土也是很广大的，如果没有健全的交通运输体系，就不可能实现工业化。
    但交通运输还不仅在物资运输方面对工业化起着积极的作用，就是对于国家资金的积累，也是有重大意义的。谁都知道，我国工业化的资金，主要是依靠节约，依靠国营企业的积累。如果交通条件便利而运输合理，能够缩短生产地与消费地的平均货运距离，加速产品的周转，节省物质资源，就会使运费大为减低，而基本建设费用，产品出厂价格和零售价格也就可以降低，资金积累也就能够增添新的源泉了。
    以上是仅就交通运输和工业化的直接关系而言。但如果我们再进一步从严密的科学见地来观察，那末，交通运输本身也是一个独立的生产部门，是可以和工业、农业等并列的。马克思在“剩余价值学说史”一书中指出：“除了开采业，农业和工业，尚有第四个物质的生产部门，那也会通过手工业经营，制造业经营，和机械经营这三个不同的阶段。那就是运输业，那或是运输人，或是运输商品。”〔四〕交通运输生产与工农业生产不同的地方，主要是在实现运输的过程中，劳动是对劳动手段发生作用，而不是对劳动对象发生作用。因此，交通运输业必须与工业发展相适应，否则就会对工业发展起着阻碍的作用。不过，这里必须着重指出，工业毕竟是国民经济的基石，如果没有高度发展的工业基础，是不可能对于交通手段和运输工具进行技术改造的。
    由上所述，交通运输和工业化的关系是非常密切的。
    我国交通运输事业包括铁路和铁路运输，公路和公路运输，河海航道和河海运输，以及航空运输、邮电等各部门。
    铁路运输对工业具有特别重要意义，三年多来，我国铁路运输的总量，约占现代化运输百分之九十左右。这种运输的优点是运量大而又比较安全准确，它对各工业中心和各重要城市间远距离的联络运输起着主导作用。但其缺点是建造成本贵，运费也比海河运输高。我国现总共仅有二万余公里的铁路，今后还须继续加以建造。今年在整个交通运输投资中，铁路已占着首位，这说明我们已很注意铁路的发展。
    海河运输大部决定于自然条件，我国海岸线漫长而江河又众多，除黄河外都便利于航行，加以这种运输运量大，成本低廉，它对工农产品的运输是应该占着很重要的地位的。今年因铁路运输已近于饱和状况，沿海和内河运输发生货多船少的现象。内河已学习苏联一列式拖运法，使落后的木帆船也能起大的运输作用，特别是在短距离的少量产品运送方面。
    公路和汽车运输对我们这个大陆国家也具有重要意义。汽车运输的优点是灵活、迅速、装卸便当，主要缺点是运量少，成本较高。汽车、铁路以及水上运输的主要差异点：前者是面的运输，后者是线的运输。汽车运输能深入到每一个乡村角落中去，是城乡物资交流的重要工具。
    航空运输也已开始建立起来。这是专为快运旅客和贵重货物，以及远程邮件的寄递而利用的，但现尚在草创时期，不能立即普遍地发展起来。
    作为转递信件、通讯联络工具的邮电事业，是交通运输的一种特殊部门。它一般是不能改变产品或人的位置，但对发展工农业的生产也起一定的作用。
    最后，还有大量落后的交通运输工具。由于我国地大物博，人口众多，现代化交通运输工具很缺乏，辽阔乡村与海河的面上运输，大部分还必须依靠落后的地方性的运输工具。现在全国各个角落还分散地存在着近四万吨的木帆船和几百万辆的骡马大车，以及其他各种民间运输工具。这种落后工具的运输量是很可观的，如去年木帆船运量的吨哩数就超过内河运量吨数将近两倍，这是必须很好利用的。
    我国各种交通运输的情况及其对于工业化的作用大致如此。
    为使我国交通运输事业能起促进工业化的作用，必须加强交通运输事业的基本建设，必须力求利用新式的交通工具，才能达到既节约而又富有效力的程度。我国第一个五年计划在集中主要力量建设国家重工业的总目标下，就规定必须相应地发展交通运输事业，国家对于交通运输基本建设的投资是很大的。但由于我国技术落后和技术干部的缺乏，不少交通运输工程发生浪费很大、质量不高的现象。因此，今后必须加强学习苏联先进经验，提高工程质量，才能保证交通运输建设不落后于工业建设，不至于阻碍工业化的速度。但最重要的问题，是加强交通运输的领导，以高度发挥交通运输的效能，否则，虽然我们拥有主要的交通手段和运输工具，还是赶不上工业建设的需要的。现有不少领导干部尚存在着不钻研业务的官僚主义作风，这是需要加以纠正的。
    在加强交通运输部门的领导中，最重要的是加强党在交通运输部门的领导。马林科夫同志在一九四一年联共（布）第十八次代表会议上的报告中，曾着重指出：“党组织应当经常钻研工业企业和铁路的工作，了解它们的需要，并帮助经济机关对工业和运输业的日常领导工作。”〔五〕我国当前交通运输事业还很分散落后，因此，加强各地方党组织对于当地交通运输事业的领导是具有非常重要意义的。各地方党组织对于国营运输企业的领导，必须注意发挥它们的社会主义的优越性。不仅要求它们改善经营管理，力求降低成本，为国家增加积累，更重要的是要求它们在中央统一领导下，为工农业生产服务，为城乡物资交流服务，首先是为国家工业化服务。
    对于私营运输企业的领导，应该充分认识，目前在若干交通运输部门中，私营还占相当的比重。例如私营汽车比公营汽车的数量就多一倍，私营的轮船运输业所占的比重也很大，至于其他大批的落后运输工具，则绝大多数都是属于私有的。因此，我们必须加强国营经济对私营运输业的领导与管理，贯彻公私兼顾的政策，发挥其运输的潜力，使之成为更有利于国计民生的运输事业。另一方面，对海上与主要内河私营轮船业，在业主自愿的原则下，必须采取有步骤、有准备、有区别的公私合营的方针，以便把私营运输业引入国家计划的轨道，为我国工业化和城乡物资交流服务，这不但对国家有利，同时也促进了私营运输业的发展。民生轮船公司自公私合营以来业务大大发展的事实证明国家资本主义的运输企业较一般的私人资本主义的运输企业具有显著的优越性。
    对于地方交通工作的领导，必须不断改进和加强。必须充分发挥落后运输工具的潜在能力，使它真正成为干线运输的有力助手，能为工业建设和城乡物资交流服务，并满足当地人民的需要。
    我们相信，各级党组织加强对交通运输部门的领导，一定能使我国的交通运输工作的质量不断地提高，促进国家工业化的实现。
