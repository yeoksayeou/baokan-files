    Lu Dingyi, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke first at the meeting. He reviewed the thirty-year history of "China Youth." He said that since the founding of "China Youth," under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, it has played a significant role in educating young people with Marxism-Leninism and encouraging them to participate in the revolutionary struggle against imperialism and feudalism. Today, as we commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of "China Youth," we should inherit the glorious traditions of the past, educate young people to learn from the shining examples of the revolutionary martyrs of the Chinese people, the earliest editors-in-chief of "China Youth" Yun Daiying, Xiao Chunu, and other comrades, dedicate their entire lives to the construction of the motherland, and strive to realize the socialist industrialization of the motherland. Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Minister of the Central Higher Education Department, and writers Xiao San and Feng Xuefeng also spoke at the meeting.
    Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Youth League, spoke last. He said: "China Youth" has cultivated thousands upon thousands of revolutionaries through thirty years of glorious and arduous journey. "China Youth" has a strong Party spirit and educates young people with the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoints, and methods. He pointed out that "China Youth" has achieved such achievements mainly due to the leadership of the Party and the support of people from all walks of life. On behalf of "China Youth," he expressed his gratitude to the good teachers and helpful friends of the youth. He said: Now, our country is carrying out the great and arduous construction of socialist industrialization, and Chinese youth need a high degree of communist consciousness and rich scientific knowledge to participate in this great cause. He hopes that everyone will better help "China Youth" so that it can better mobilize and educate the vast number of young people and make greater contributions to the construction cause.
    Note: "China Youth" was founded on October 20, 1923, and was the organ publication of the Chinese Socialist Youth League at that time. It ceased publication in 1927 due to the oppression of the reactionaries. From 1939 to 1940, "China Youth" was re-published in Yan'an. The current "China Youth" was re-published in December 1948, and it is now the organ publication of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. "China Youth" currently has a circulation of over 600,000 copies and has a wide influence among young people.

    【本报讯】一九五三年十月二十日为“中国青年”创刊三十周年纪念日，中国青年社在京举行纪念会。参加纪念会的有陆定一、曾昭抡、周建人、丁玲、萧三、熊复、冯雪峰、艾青、周立波、柯柏年、高士其、丁瓒、曾三、黄操良、田家英、魏巍、王朝闻、赵沨等一百余人。参加纪念会的还有中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记胡耀邦、刘导生、罗毅、区棠亮等。
    中共中央宣传部副部长陆定一首先在会上讲话。他回溯了“中国青年”三十年来的历史。他说，“中国青年”创刊以来，在中国共产党的领导下，以马克思列宁主义教育青年，鼓舞青年参加反对帝国主义、封建主义的革命斗争，起了巨大的作用。今天我们纪念“中国青年”创刊三十周年，应继承过去的光荣传统，教育青年学习中国人民革命先烈、“中国青年”最早的主编人恽代英、萧楚女等同志的光辉榜样，把整个生命贡献给祖国建设事业，为实现祖国的社会主义工业化而努力。在会上讲话的还有中央高等教育部副部长曾昭抡，作家萧三、冯雪峰等。
    青年团中央书记胡耀邦最后讲话。他说：“中国青年”经过三十年光荣而艰巨的道路，培养了千千万万的革命者。“中国青年”具有强烈的党性，以马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法教育青年。他指出：“中国青年”所以获得这样的成绩，主要是由于党的领导，由于各方面人士的支持。他代表“中国青年”，向青年的良师益友表示感谢。他说：现在，我们国家正在进行伟大的、艰巨的社会主义工业化的建设，中国青年需要有高度的共产主义觉悟和丰富的科学知识，来参加这个伟大的事业。希望大家更好地帮助“中国青年”，使它能更好地动员与教育广大青年，在建设事业中作出更大的贡献。
    按：“中国青年”创刊于一九二三年十月二十日，是当时中国社会主义青年团的机关刊物，一九二七年因反动派压迫而停刊。一九三九年至一九四○年，“中国青年”在延安复刊。现在的“中国青年”是在一九四八年十二月再度复刊的，它现在是中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会的机关刊物。“中国青年”目前发行额已超过六十万份，在青年群众中有广泛的影响。
