Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 6th: On October 4th, another three Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel and two Korean People's Army captured personnel who broke through the control of special agents and requested repatriation were handed over to our side by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. One of the Volunteer Army captured personnel, Zhang Shiying, was unable to freely express his will to be repatriated due to the terrorist control of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' special agents. On October 2nd, he attempted to slit his throat and wrists to commit suicide, expressing his firm opposition to forced detention. At that time, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' special agents refused to send him to the hospital by Indian personnel and took the opportunity to rush out of the camp and attack the Indian troops, creating a riot.

After Zhang Shiying got off the repatriation vehicle, he burst into tears on the staff of the Korean and Chinese side. Pointing to his injured throat and wrists wrapped in gauze, he recounted to the neutral country personnel, our staff, and reporters from various countries the process of being forced to commit suicide, saying: "Under the terrorist rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' special agents, we cannot freely express our will to be repatriated. On October 2nd, I pretended to have a stomachache and went to the hospital for treatment, hoping to find an opportunity to break through the special agents' control and request repatriation. But when I went to the hospital, I immediately found five Chiang Kai-shek bandits' special agents following me closely. They pretended to go to the hospital to see a doctor, but in reality, they were monitoring me. Later, I wanted to express my desire to be repatriated to the Indian doctor who was treating me, but his translator was also a Chiang Kai-shek bandit's special agent, and I couldn't explain my will to him. At that time, I had no way to think, and I was so anxious that I took out a razor blade that I had prepared earlier and tried to cut my wrists and throat to commit suicide. I thought to myself: if the Indian doctor saves me, I will be able to break through the special agents' control and request repatriation. If he can't save me, I would rather die than be forcibly detained. The Indian doctor immediately pulled me away and put me on a stretcher to send me to the hospital. However, the five Chiang Kai-shek bandits' special agents who were monitoring me grabbed the stretcher together and refused to let me go. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit's special agent who was acting as a translator ran out to report to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's special agent 'Captain'. After a while, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' special agents in the camp blew their whistles to assemble. I heard the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's special agent 'Captain' taking the lead and shouting: 'Hand over your guns, hand over the Indians' guns!' The Chiang Kai-shek bandits' special agents coerced the prisoners of war to rush out of the barbed wire and attack the Indian troops. Later, after the Indian troops opened fire to stop the riot, I escaped from danger."

Finally, Zhang Shiying, on behalf of the repatriated Korean and Chinese captured personnel, expressed his gratitude to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian troops. Indian Deputy Press Officer Major Rangga expressed his thanks on behalf of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

    我方被俘人员又有五名遣返归来
    【新华社开城六日电】十月四日，又有突破特务控制要求遣返的三名中国人民志愿军被俘人员和两名朝鲜人民军被俘人员，由中立国遣返委员会遣交给我方。其中有一个志愿军被俘人员张世英，由于在蒋匪特务的恐怖控制下无法自由表达遣返回国的意志，曾在十月二日企图割破喉咙和手腕自杀，表示坚决反对强迫扣留。当时，蒋匪特务竟拒绝印度人员把他送到医院去，并且乘机冲出营场袭击印度部队，制造暴乱事件。
    张世英走下遣送车辆以后，就伏在朝中方面的工作人员身上痛哭。他指着包扎着纱布的受伤的喉咙和手腕，向在场的中立国人员、我方工作人员和各国记者控诉他被迫自杀的经过说：“在蒋匪特务的恐怖统治下，我们无法自由表达遣返回国的意志。十月二日，我就假装肚子痛，到医院去治疗，希望找个机会突破特务控制要求遣返。但是我走到医院去时，立刻发现有五个蒋匪特务紧紧地跟着我。他们假装到医院去看病，实际上是监视我。后来我想向给我看病的印度医生表示要求遣返，但是他的翻译也是蒋匪特务，我无法对他说明自己的意志。当时，我无法可想，急得就拿出早就准备好的刀片，企图割破手腕和喉咙自杀。我心里想：如果印度医生救我，我就能突破特务控制要求遣返，如果他不能救我，我宁死也不愿被强迫扣留。印度医生立刻拉住了我，并且把我放上担架准备送到医院去。但是，那五个监视我的蒋匪特务就一起拉住担架，不让我走。那个当翻译的蒋匪特务跑出去报告蒋匪特务‘大队长’。不一会，营场里蒋匪特务就吹哨集合。我听到那个蒋匪特务‘大队长’领头喊道：‘缴枪、缴印度人的枪！’蒋匪特务就胁持战俘冲出铁丝网，袭击印度部队。后来，印度部队开枪制止这次暴乱以后，我才脱了险。”
    最后，张世英代表遣返归来的朝中被俘人员向中立国遣返委员会和印度部队表示谢意。印度副新闻发布官朗格少校当场代表中立国遣返委员会表示答谢。
