    Southwest state-owned commercial departments are adopting various methods to organize sources of goods and strengthen allocation and transportation, ensuring that all regions receive sufficient supplies. In organizing sources of goods, one aspect is expanding the quantity and variety of goods purchased from outside the region. For example, the Chongqing Supply Station of the Department Store increased its purchases from outside the region by 77% in the third and fourth quarters compared to the first half of the year, and the variety of goods increased from 3,500 in the second quarter to 7,500. On the other hand, it has strengthened processing orders for local industrial products and purchases of handicrafts. The Chongqing Supply Station of the Department Store underwrote 85% of the total output value of Chongqing's local state-owned industries and purchased 50% of the total output value of private manufacturers. Yunnan's purchases of local industrial and handicraft products in the second half of the year increased by 69.98% compared to the first half of the year; Guizhou has expanded its business plan for products produced within the province since the third quarter, and has newly added more than 80 varieties of purchases; Sichuan's procurement plan for the third quarter has now been largely completed. At the Third Supply Conference held by the Chongqing Supply Station of the Department Store in mid-September, among the transactions of more than 70 units including department store supply stations in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces, and some county stores in Sichuan, the transaction amount within the region accounted for 60% of the total transaction amount. The Southwest China Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company has also expanded the processing quantity of factory-made and native cloth within the region in advance, preparing a large amount of dyed, high-quality, and reasonably priced cloth. At present, a large amount of blue, gray, and cyan cloth suitable for rural needs, as well as native woven and bleached calico, reverse flannel, quilt cover flannel, fuzzy flannel, line flannel, and square flannel, are being transferred to rural areas. At the same time, consideration is also given to the colors and varieties needed by large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas.

    With the growth of people's needs and the expansion of sources of goods, allocation and transportation work has also been strengthened. Under the leadership of the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee, state-owned commercial departments have obtained a guarantee from the railway department to be responsible for on-time transportation; shipping departments have taken transporting goods as their main task, strengthening the work of transfer stations and speeding up transportation; in addition to giving full play to the existing potential of the Southwest Transportation Company, highway transportation will also increase the dispatch of vehicles from other departments to provide assistance; purchases from outside the region will also be allocated in advance. Due to the importance attached by various relevant departments, the state-owned commercial transportation plan for the second half of the year has increased by 150% compared to the first half of the year. Compared with the average performance in the first half of the year, the actual transportation performance in August increased by 40.48% for highway transportation, of which department store transportation increased by 121.75%; due to the seasonal nature of native products, the transportation volume of shipping increased even more, increasing by 132% in August compared to June.

    At present, there are still a few areas where some commodities are out of stock due to insufficient estimates of market conditions, insufficient attention to handicrafts closely related to rural areas and farmers, such as small commodities, poor work in organizing sources of goods, and shortcomings in transportation and allocation. These problems have attracted the attention of the leading authorities and are being gradually corrected.

    西南国营贸易部门采取各种措施  充分保证旺季物资供应
    西南国营商业部门采取各种办法组织货源，加强调拨运输，保证各地得到充分的物资供应。在组织货源上一方面是扩大外区进货数量和品种。如百货公司重庆供应站三、四季度外区进货比上半年扩大百分之七十七，品种由第二季度的三千五百种增为七千五百种。另一方面是加强了对地方工业产品的加工订货和手工业品的收购。百货公司重庆供应站包销了重庆地方国营工业生产总值的百分之八十五，收购私营厂商生产总值的百分之五十。云南下半年对地方工业及手工业产品的收购比上半年增加百分之六十九点九八；贵州自第三季度扩大对省内生产品的经营计划，已新增加收购品种八十多种；四川第三季度的采购计划现已大部完成。九月中旬百货公司重庆供应站召开的第三届供应会议上，四川、云南、贵州、西康等省百货供应站及四川部分县商店共七十多个单位成交额中，区内成交金额即占总成交额的百分之六十。西南区花纱布公司也提早扩大了区内厂布及土布的加工数量，准备了大量的染色好、品质好、价格合理的布匹。目前，大量适合农村需要的蓝、灰、青色布及土织漂色花布、反花呢、被面呢、冲毛呢、线呢、四角呢等正往农村调运。与此同时，也照顾到大、中城市和工矿区需要的花色品种。
    随着人民需要的增长，货源的扩大，调拨运输工作也加强了。在西南财政经济委员会领导下，国营商业部门已得到铁路方面负责按时运输的保证；航运方面已把运输物资当作主要任务，加强转运站的工作，加快运输速度；公路运输除充分发挥西南运输公司现有潜在力外，并将增调其他部门车辆增援；外区进货也提前调拨。由于各有关部门的重视，国营商业下半年运输计划较上半年增大了一倍半，八月份运输实绩与上半年平均实绩比较，公路运输增加百分之四十点四八，其中百货运输增加百分之一百二十一点七五；航运由于土产季节性的关系，运输量增加更大，八月份比六月份增加百分之一百三十二。
    目前也还有少数地区，由于对市场情况估计不足，对适合农村与农民关系密切的手工业品如小百货等重视不够，货源组织工作做得差，以及运输调拨上的缺点，产生部分商品脱销现象。这些问题已引起领导机构的重视，正逐步纠正。
