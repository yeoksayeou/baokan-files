Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 21st—The explanatory work by the Korean-Chinese side was still unable to proceed on the 21st. Because the Indian custodial forces have not yet taken effective action against the anti-explanation schemes of the Rhee Syngman bandit special agents mixed among the prisoners of war, the explanatory work has been interrupted for three consecutive days.

According to the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work" unanimously adopted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the country to which the prisoners of war belong has the right to formulate an explanation plan, and the custodial forces have the obligation to implement this plan. However, since the explanatory work began on the 15th, the explanation work plan proposed by the Korean-Chinese side has not been implemented as planned, especially the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army have not yet had the opportunity to hear the explanations. Recently returned captured personnel of the People's Army said that the Rhee Syngman bandit gang continues to use radio to instruct special agents not to allow Korean prisoners of war to go out and listen to explanations. If the Indian custodial forces continue to allow the Rhee bandit special agents to implement the U.S. side's plan to sabotage the explanatory work, the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work" will become unenforceable empty words.

According to the notification from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the evening of the 20th, the commander of the Indian custodial forces is "continuing his efforts to persuade the prisoners of war to listen to explanations." However, more than one hundred captured personnel of the Korean-Chinese side who returned before and after the start of the explanatory work after breaking through the control of special agents have repeatedly pointed out that the so-called "prisoner of war representatives" who are the objects of the Indian custodial forces' "persuasion" are precisely the Rhee bandit special agents who use violence to prevent prisoners of war from listening to explanations. It is self-evident what results will be obtained from the Indian custodial forces' "persuasion" of these special agents. Recently returned captured personnel of the People's Army said that the U.S. special agents have become even more arrogant under this kind of "persuasion." They believe that they can recklessly coerce the prisoners of war to refuse to listen to explanations and implement the U.S. side's plan to delay the explanations.

### 由于印度看管部队未对美方特务采取有效行动  我方的解释工作已被迫中断三天

    由于印度看管部队未对美方特务采取有效行动
    我方的解释工作已被迫中断三天
    【新华社开城二十一日电】二十一日朝中方面的解释工作仍然未能进行。由于印度看管部队对于混在战俘中的李匪特务的反解释计划至今没有采取有效行动，解释工作已接连中断了三天。
    根据中立国遣返委员会一致通过的“解释和访问工作细则”，战俘所属国家有制定解释计划的权利，看管部队有执行该项计划的义务。但自十五日解释工作开始以来，朝中方面提出的解释工作计划一直没有按计划实施，尤其是朝鲜人民军被俘人员迄未得到听取解释的机会。最近归来的人民军被俘人员说：李承晚匪帮继续用电台指示特务，不许朝鲜籍战俘外出听取解释。如果印度看管部队继续听任李匪特务执行美方破坏解释工作的计划，“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”便将变成不能实施的空文。
    据二十日晚中立国遣返委员会的通知说，印度看管部队司令正在“继续他的努力，劝说战俘听取解释”。但是，在解释工作开始前后突破特务控制归来的一百多名朝中被俘人员早已不断指出，作为印度看管部队“劝说”对象的所谓“战俘代表”，正是用暴力阻止战俘听取解释的李匪特务。印度看管部队向这些特务进行“劝说”会得到什么结果，这是不言自明的。最近归来的人民军被俘人员说，美方特务分子在这种“劝说”下气焰更加嚣张了，他们认为尽可放肆胁迫战俘拒绝听取解释，实行美方所指示的拖延解释的计划了。
