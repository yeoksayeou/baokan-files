    Oppose "Holding Back"
    The increase production and practice economy movement in industrial and mining enterprises must be combined with the improvement of enterprise management. Only in this way can we improve leadership, ensure the comprehensive completion and over-fulfillment of national plans, and promote the advancement of future construction undertakings. For this reason, the leading cadres of enterprises need to be specifically familiar with industrial production or basic construction work, and lead and organize the masses to tap potential. Many leading cadres of industrial and mining enterprises have clearly recognized this problem, so they can find the key to enterprise production after mobilizing the masses to inspect work, formulate practical and feasible plans for increasing production and practicing economy, and take effective measures to tap potential. Their increase production and practice economy movement is developing normally, and their work has achieved significant achievements in over-fulfilling the September or third quarter plan.
    However, a small number of leading cadres in enterprises still do not understand the purpose of increasing production and practicing economy. They are afraid that if they increase production this year, the production targets for next year will be raised, making it difficult to over-fulfill the task. They cannot see or are unwilling to see the potential of their own enterprises, and they are even more unwilling to mobilize the masses to tap potential and improve the leadership level of the enterprises, so as to push production forward. As a result, they take the method of "holding back" to deal with the increase production and practice economy movement. A state-owned coal mine was given a production task of 100,000 tons of coal by the state this year. By September, they had almost completed 180,000 tons of coal, which shows that their potential is very large. However, they only proposed a plan to increase production and practice economy by 2.8 billion yuan on the basis of completing 180,000 tons. Calculated at Beijing's market price, 2.8 billion yuan can only buy more than 11,000 tons of grade A lump coal. Of course, the quality and price of coal in the two places are different, but the disparity between the actual output of the mine and the figures in the increase production and practice economy plan fully demonstrates the situation of "holding back".
    The Changchun Electrical Equipment Manufacturing Factory has a similar situation. The factory expects to complete the annual production plan by mid-October. In the remaining two months or so, even if production is carried out according to the original production situation, it can still complete a total product value of 1.425 billion yuan. However, the factory included the production of these two months in the calculation and only formulated an annual increase production and practice economy plan of 1.4 billion yuan. This increase production and practice economy plan is 25 million yuan less than not increasing production and practicing economy.
    These situations reflect the conservative thinking of some leading cadres of enterprises. They are only satisfied with effortlessly "surpassing" the already surpassed quotas and are afraid of catching up with and surpassing advanced quotas. In this way, the leadership level of the enterprises is far behind the reality, which hinders the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses from being brought into play and hinders the further improvement and development of production.
    Correcting this conservative thinking will make the increase production and practice economy movement surge. The example of the State-owned Petroleum Factory No. 1 is a good illustration:
    The recovery rate of washing medium wax in the paraffin workshop of the State-owned Petroleum Factory No. 1 was originally planned to be 93.5%, but it has actually reached 94.8%. When formulating the increase production and practice economy plan, the workshop wanted to "hold back" and set the recovery rate of washing medium wax at 94%. After the leading cadres of the factory went deep into the workshop to find out the details, they immediately convened a meeting to criticize this conservative thinking, used this example to educate all employees, and planned to lead the masses to break through several major economic quotas, increase the crude oil extraction rate and the recovery rate of gasoline, distillation, and paraffin. In addition, measures such as exchanging experience and strengthening maintenance work have greatly changed the face of the factory's increase production and practice economy movement. The original task of increasing production and practicing economy given to the factory by the higher authorities was 28.8 billion yuan. After mass discussion, the plan was revised three times, and the factory guaranteed to increase production and practice economy by 42 billion yuan.
    It should be affirmed that the potential we have in all aspects is very great. As long as the leading cadres maintain a clear mind, strengthen ties with the masses, rely on the masses, implement the Party's policies well, and are good at grasping the key and tapping potential, then the leadership level can be improved, and the national plan tasks and the increase production and practice economy tasks can be completed and over-fulfilled.

    反对“留一手”
    工矿企业的增产节约运动必须和改进企业管理相结合，这才能提高领导水平，保证全面完成和超额完成国家计划，并推动今后建设事业的前进。为此，企业的领导干部就需要具体地熟悉工业生产或基本建设工作，有领导地、有组织地发动群众挖掘潜在能力。许多工矿企业的领导干部明确地认识到了这个问题，因此他们就能在发动群众检查工作以后，找到企业生产的关键所在，订出切实可行的增产节约计划，并采取有效措施去挖掘潜力。他们的增产节约运动正常地发展着，他们的工作在超额完成九月份或第三季度计划中获得了显著的成就。
    也有少数企业的领导干部，对增产节约的目的还弄不清，他们害怕今年增加了产量，明年的生产指标又要提高，不容易超额完成任务。他们看不见或不愿看见自己企业的潜力所在，更不愿发动群众去挖掘潜力，并提高企业的领导水平，把生产推向前进。于是，他们就采取“留一手”的办法来应付增产节约运动。有一个国营煤矿，今年国家给他们的生产任务是十万吨煤，他们在九月间已快完成了十八万吨煤，可见他们的潜力是很大的。但是他们只提出在完成十八万吨的基础上增产节约二十八亿元的计划，以北京的市价来核算，二十八亿元只能买到甲块门煤一万一千多吨。当然，两地煤的质量和价格是不一样的，但从该矿实际产量和增产节约计划数字之间的悬殊，已完全可以看出这种“留一手”的情形了。
    长春电气器材制造厂也有同样的情形。该厂预计到十月中旬就可以完成全年生产计划，剩下的两个多月，即使是依照原来的生产情况进行生产，也还可以完成十四亿二千五百万元的产品总值，但该厂将这两个多月的生产计算在内，只订了全年增产节约十四亿元的计划。这个增产节约计划，比不增产节约还少两千五百万元。
    这些情况反映了某些企业领导干部的保守思想。他们仅仅满足于不费力气地“超越”已经超越了的定额，害怕追上和超越先进的定额。这样，企业的领导水平就大大落后于现实，就妨碍着广大群众的积极性和创造性的发挥，妨碍着生产的进一步提高和发展。
    纠正这种保守思想，就会使增产节约运动高涨起来。国营石油一厂的例子，就是一个很好的说明：
    国营石油一厂石蜡车间洗中蜡的收率，原订计划是百分之九十三点五，但实际上已达到了百分之九十四点八。该车间在订增产节约计划时想“留一手”，把洗中蜡的收率订为百分之九十四。该厂领导干部深入车间摸清底细以后，立即召集会议批判这种保守思想，用这个实例教育全体职工，并且有计划地领导群众突破几项主要经济定额，提高了原油采油率和汽油、蒸馏、石蜡的收率。再加上交流经验，加强检修工作等等措施，就大大改变了该厂增产节约运动的面貌。原来上级给该厂增产节约的任务是二百八十八亿元，经过群众讨论，三次修订了计划，该厂保证增产节约四百二十亿元。
    应该肯定：我们在各方面存在着的潜力是很大的。只要领导干部保持清醒的头脑，加强与群众的联系，依靠群众，很好地贯彻党的政策，善于抓住关键，挖掘潜力，那么，领导水平是可以提高的，国家计划任务和增产节约任务是可以完成和超额完成的。
