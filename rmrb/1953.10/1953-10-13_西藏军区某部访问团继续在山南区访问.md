Xinhua News Agency:
    A visiting delegation organized by a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region visited the Shannan area of Tibet this summer. The Shannan area is located in the southeastern corner of Tibet, the vast area east of Yamdrok Lake and south of the Gangdise Mountains. It is rich in products and relatively developed in culture, making it the wealthiest area in Tibet. The visiting delegation has been in this area for more than four months and has received a warm welcome and love from the Tibetan people of the region. When the delegation arrived in Tsedang (on the south bank of the Yarlung Zangbo River), the first major city in the area, the local Tibetans performed the most wonderful Tibetan opera to express their welcome. Tubdan Qiangbao, the Loka Jizong (equivalent to commissioner) of the local government of Tibet, also hosted a banquet to welcome them, and lamas from major monasteries in Tsedang also sent representatives to present hadas to the delegation.
    During the visit, the delegation gained an in-depth understanding of the lives and demands of the Tibetan people in the Shannan area and conveyed the care of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao to the Tibetan people. The members of the delegation walked more than 5,000 li, crossed high mountains and rapids, and went deep into the Himalayas. During the visit, the members established close friendships with the Tibetan people. Tibetans in various places expressed their infinite gratitude for Chairman Mao's concern.
    The delegation presented a large number of Tibetan picture books and national policy documents to Tibetans in various places, and showed colorful lantern slides. In addition to providing mobile medical treatment for Tibetans, the medical staff of the delegation also set up a temporary clinic in Tsedang to provide free medical treatment for monks, nuns, and laypeople.
    The visiting delegation is still continuing its visit.

    访问团在访问过程中，深入了解了山南区藏族人民的生活和要求，传达了中央人民政府和毛主席对西藏人民的关怀。团员们徒步跋涉了五千里以上的路程，并跨越高山和急流，深入喜马拉雅山中。在访问中团员们和藏族人民建立了亲密的友谊。各地藏民对毛主席的关怀表示无限感激。
    访问团曾赠送各地藏民大批藏文画报、民族政策文件，并放映了五彩幻灯片，访问团的医务人员除流动为藏民治病外，还在泽当设立了临时门诊部，免费为僧俗人民治病。
    现在，访问团仍在继续访问。
