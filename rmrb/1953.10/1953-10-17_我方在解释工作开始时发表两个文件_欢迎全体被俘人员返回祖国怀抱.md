Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th -- The Korean-Chinese side issued the following two documents to the non-directly repatriated Korean-Chinese prisoners of war at the start of the explanatory work on the 15th:

I. Statement by the Spokesman of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army and the Command of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Prisoner Repatriation Issue, April 6, 1952

	The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have consistently advocated that after the cessation of active hostilities, the belligerent parties should promptly release and repatriate all prisoners of war held by each side. This reasonable proposition will not be altered in any way because some of our captured personnel, during their detention, had tattoos on their arms, or wrote certain documents, or engaged in other similar behavior. We are fully aware that these actions were by no means voluntary on their part, and they should not be held responsible for them. We wholeheartedly welcome all our captured personnel back to the embrace of the motherland. We have also guaranteed in our agreement with the other side that all captured personnel will be reunited with their families after repatriation, participate in peaceful construction, and live peaceful lives.

II. Letter from Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai to Captured Personnel

Comrades of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers who have been captured:

	In negotiations with the other side, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have consistently insisted, in accordance with the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, that you have the right to return to your respective countries and live peaceful lives after the armistice, and issued a statement on April 6, 1952, fully welcoming you back to the embrace of the motherland. Now that the Korean armistice has been realized, the time has come for you to return to the motherland. According to the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," no one is allowed to threaten you and obstruct you from realizing your desire to return to the motherland. We deeply understand your longing for the motherland and the unfortunate experiences you have had since being captured. Some of you were forced to tattoo your arms, write certain documents, join certain organizations, hold positions in enemy prisoner of war camps, or engage in other similar behavior during your detention. We believe that these were not voluntary on your part and you should not be held responsible for them. We hereby solemnly announce that all our captured personnel, regardless of any of the above-mentioned behavior in enemy prisoner of war camps, will not be held accountable for the past upon returning to the motherland. All returnees will be reunited with their families, participate in the construction of the motherland, and live peaceful lives. Representatives are being sent to extend our condolences to you, inform you of matters related to your return to the motherland, and welcome you back. We and the people of Korea and China are all concerned about you and eagerly await your return.

		Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army
		Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers
		September 30, 1953

    我方在解释工作开始时发表两个文件
    欢迎全体被俘人员返回祖国怀抱
    【新华社开城十六日电】朝中方面在十五日解释工作开始时，向不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员发表了下列两个文件：
    一、一九五二年四月六日朝鲜人民军最高司令部及中国人民志愿军司令部发言人对遣俘问题发表的声明
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军一向主张在积极的敌对行为停止后，交战双方应迅速释放并遣返各自收容的全部战俘。这种合理的主张，绝不因我方被俘人员在拘留期间，曾有一部分人在臂上刺字，或写下某种文件，或作其他类似的行为而有所改变。我们深知这些行为绝非出于他们的自愿，不应由他们负责。我们完全欢迎我方全体被俘人员回到祖国的怀抱。我们并已在与对方的协议中，保证全部被俘人员在遣返后与其家人团聚，参加和平建设事业，并过和平生活。
    二、金日成元帅、彭德怀司令员告被俘人员书朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘的同志们：
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在与对方谈判中，根据日内瓦战俘待遇公约，一贯坚持在停战后你们有返回各自祖国回家过和平生活的权利，并曾于一九五二年四月六日发表声明，完全欢迎你们回到祖国的怀抱。现在朝鲜停战已经实现，你们返回祖国的时机已经到来。根据“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定，任何人都不容威胁你们并阻挠你们实现返回祖国的愿望。我们深切了解你们对于祖国的想念和被俘以后的不幸遭遇。你们之中有些人在被扣留期间被迫在臂上刺字，写过某种文件，参加过某种组织，在对方战俘营中担任过职务，或有其他类似行为，我们认为这些都不是出于你们的自愿，不应由你们自己负责。我们特此郑重负责宣布：凡我方被俘人员，不管他在对方战俘营中有何种上述行为，回到祖国后，一律不咎既往；一切归国人员，均将与家人团聚，参加祖国建设事业，并过和平生活。兹派代表前来慰问你们，通知你们返回祖国的有关事项，并迎接你们返回祖国。我们和朝中两国全国人民都在关怀着你们，切望你们归来。
    朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成
    中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀
    一九五三年九月三十日
