    The Sunan District Cultural Relics Management Committee Collects Ancient Cultural Relics and Books
    The Sunan District Cultural Relics Management Committee of Jiangsu Province has extensively collected ancient books and cultural relics. In the past three years, it has collected more than 24,000 cultural relics and 450,000 books. The area south of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province has a relatively developed culture. After liberation, many precious books and cultural relics were accepted or cleared from warehouses in various places. At the same time, there are many collectors in various places. The Cultural Relics Management Committee has extensively set up specialized or part-time institutions in areas with more cultural relics to be responsible for collecting and preserving cultural heritage, and also pays attention to selecting and purchasing books and cultural relics scattered in market used bookstores or antique shops. Up to now, the Sunan District Cultural Relics Management Committee of Jiangsu Province has collected more than 24,000 cultural relics in twenty categories, including stone tools, oracle bones, pottery, bronzes, jade, weapons, musical instruments, bricks, inscriptions, calligraphy and painting, and art crafts. Among them are the Zu Ding Ding of the Shang Dynasty, the Zhou Gong Geng Zhong of the Zhou Dynasty, the wooden Arhat sculpture of Yang Huizhi of the Tang Dynasty, the landscape axis of Shen Zhou and Tang Yin of the Ming Dynasty, and the Canglang Pavilion map of Wang Shigu of the Qing Dynasty, totaling more than 10,000 fine pieces. In the books collected over the past three years, there are Tang Dynasty handwritten scripture scrolls, Gu Tinglin's draft of "Tianxia Junguo Libing Shu", Ke Peiyuan's draft of "Gamelan Zhi", the Yuan Dynasty edition of "Liu Zongyuan Ji", Qing Dynasty Zhao Huifu's diary (containing a large amount of Taiping Heavenly Kingdom historical materials), and 1,177 types of provincial, prefectural, state, county, and hall chronicles nationwide. After the Sunan District Cultural Relics Management Committee obtained these books and cultural relics, it hired experts to identify, sort, register, classify, and number them, and store them in warehouses for safekeeping.

    Central Film Bureau Publishes "The Five-Year Plan for Soviet Films After the War"
    The Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government recently published a book entitled "The Five-Year Plan for Soviet Films After the War." This book selects two documents on the development of Soviet film industry after the war by Paul Shakov, Minister of the Soviet Film Industry Department and current Deputy Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union. The first document, "The Five-Year Plan for Restoring and Developing the Soviet Film Industry," was his report at the "Film House" in Moscow in 1946. This report outlined a grand vision for the development of the Soviet film industry after the war. The second document, "Soviet Film Art in the Post-War Period," was a report he made in 1952 at the invitation of the "Soviet Association for the Popularization of Political and Scientific Knowledge," which summarized the development of Soviet film art in the post-war period. This book also includes 49 pictures of excellent films produced in the Soviet Union after the war, collected by the editors, from which one can see the development of the Soviet film industry in recent years.
