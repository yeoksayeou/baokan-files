Construction Begins on China's New, Large-Scale Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant
Newly Built State-Owned Zhengzhou Thermal Power Plant Begins Generating Electricity

One of China's largest newly constructed thermal power plants—the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant—commenced construction on October 24th. All the workers responsible for building this new power plant held a grand groundbreaking ceremony that day. Representatives from the Shanxi Provincial Committee and Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, the North China Electric Power Administration, and various state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in Taiyuan, as well as nearby farmers, attended the ceremony. At 2 PM, Wang Daren, Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, took the first shovel of earth, marking the beginning of the construction project for this new power plant.

Industrial construction in the Taiyuan area is developing rapidly, with the current total industrial output value exceeding three times that of the early post-liberation period. Many large-scale new factories are under construction. Once completed, the new Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant will meet the growing needs of industrial construction with an electricity supply equal to three times the existing power generation capacity of the Taiyuan area. The entire construction project will be carried out in two phases, with full completion by 1957 and partial power generation beginning by the end of 1954 or early 1955. The new power plant will also use a large amount of steam heat generated during power generation to supply nearby factories. Abundant coal mines and rivers in the vicinity will supply the plant with inexpensive fuel and ample water resources.

The new Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant is one of the 141 enterprises being newly built and renovated in China with comprehensive Soviet assistance. The entire project is designed by Soviet experts according to the most advanced Soviet technical standards, and all machinery and equipment are supplied by the Soviet Union and are world-class. In the future, the entire process of fuel transportation, power generation, and power supply at the power plant will be operated by automated and mechanized equipment. The plant's daily consumption of thousands of tons of coal and the disposal of hundreds of tons of coal ash will be transported by automated mechanical equipment, saving at least 1,000 labor units per day compared to manual labor. In the event of an accident, all machinery and equipment in the plant can automatically shut down or automatically switch to backup equipment. The latest dust removal equipment will ensure that the smoke emitted from the chimneys does not contain any coal ash, which is not only beneficial to the health of the plant's employees but also to the environmental hygiene of the entire city.

In twenty days from now, the Taiyuan area will freeze over. The plant has made preparations for large-scale winter construction. During the winter, a "warm shed steam heating" construction method will be adopted to keep the construction site at a constant indoor temperature of 15 degrees Celsius. In carrying out various construction preparation tasks, the Taiyuan municipal party and government leading organs have assigned more than 100 cadres to the plant. The North China Electric Power Administration has transferred a large number of employees from various capital construction units to form an engineering company for the construction of the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant. State-owned Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory and other units have also lent the plant belt conveyors, bulldozers, and steam boilers for cold protection.

Xinhua News Agency - The newly built state-owned Zhengzhou Thermal Power Plant began generating electricity at 0:15 on October 24th and was connected to the old power plant. From now on, the existing factories in Zhengzhou and the more than ten factories under construction and expansion will be able to obtain a more ample power supply. This power plant will soon be connected to the power grids of important cities and industrial and mining areas in northern and western Henan, and will supply power to these areas to meet the needs of industrial development.

The Zhengzhou Power Plant is one of the large-scale enterprises being newly built and renovated in China with comprehensive Soviet assistance. It took only ten months from the start of construction and installation to the operation and power generation of the machines. During the construction process, more than 20 Soviet experts provided technical guidance in various aspects, and they made thousands of suggestions. Soviet experts also used various methods to train a group of Chinese technicians and skilled workers with independent construction capabilities, thereby ensuring the progress and quality of the project. The steam turbine generator and steam boiler, from the start of trial operation to formal power generation, have demonstrated their excellent quality. When the huge and complex machines started running, only a few workers were operating the machines, and they were working very happily. In the boiler, turbine, electrical, and vehicle rooms, there is a set of instruments with many pointers moving back and forth, indicating the operating conditions of the machines. All equipment in the workshop is also controlled by buttons. Although there is no one in the distribution room, as long as the remote switch in the main control room is turned, it will make a loud closing sound as if someone is operating it. The instrument also has signal lights and alarm devices. If an accident is likely to occur there, it can be known while sitting in the workshop. The entire process of the coal feeding system uses machines instead of manpower. As soon as a button is pressed, the coal is sent along a long conveyor belt to the coal mill, ground into coal powder, and blown into the boiler. Zhu Xiushan, a worker who has been burning boilers for seven years, looked lightly at a coal mill. Boiler workers are no longer covered in black, but are wearing white work clothes and standing next to the machines as the commanders of the machines.

### 我国新建规模巨大的太原电热厂开始动工  新建国营郑州火力发电厂已开始发电

    我国新建规模巨大的太原电热厂开始动工
    新建国营郑州火力发电厂已开始发电
    我国新建规模最大的火力发电厂之一——太原电热厂已于十月二十四日动工。负责建设这座新电厂的全体职工当天举行了隆重的开工奠基典礼。参加典礼的有中共山西省委、太原市委，山西省人民政府，华北电业管理局和太原市各国营、地方国营厂矿及工地附近农民等代表。下午二时，中共太原市委书记王大任首先执锹破土，这一新电厂的建厂工程从此开始了。
    太原地区工业建设发展很快，现有工业总产值已超过刚解放时三倍，不少规模巨大的新型工厂正在建设。新建太原电热厂建成后，将以等于太原地区现有发电能力三倍的电力满足日益增大的工业建设需要。整个建厂工程从现在开始将分两期进行，一九五七年全部完成，并在一九五四年底或一九五五年初开始局部发电。新电厂还将用发电后的大量蒸汽热能供给邻近的工厂。附近蕴藏丰富的煤矿和河流，将供给该厂以廉价的燃料和充足的水源。
    新建太原电热厂是苏联全面援助我国新建和改建的一百四十一个企业中的一个。全部工程是苏联专家按照苏联最先进的技术标准设计起来的，所有机器设备也是由苏联供给我国的世界上第一流的。将来电厂的燃料运输、发电、供电等全部过程都将由自动化机械化的设备来操作。该厂每天所用成千吨的煤炭和送出成百吨的煤灰都将由自动化的机械设备来运输，比用手工劳动每天至少可节省一千个劳动力，如万一发生事故，全厂所有机器设备都能自动停车或自动地换上备用设备。最新式的除尘设备将使烟筒中冒出的烟不会有一点煤灰，不但有益于厂内职工身体健康，而且有利于整个城市的环境卫生。
    从现在起再有二十天，太原地区就要封冻了。该厂已作好大规模冬季施工的准备。冬季中将采取
    “暖棚蒸气加热”的施工方法，使工地永远保持摄氏十五度的室内温度。在进行各项建厂准备工作中，太原市党政领导机关已给该厂配备了一百多干部；华北电业管理局从各个基本建设单位抽调大批职工，组成了建设太原电热厂的工程公司，国营太原重型机器厂等单位也都借给该厂皮带运输机、推土机和防寒所用的蒸气锅炉等施工设备。
    新建国营郑州火力发电厂已在十月二十四日零时一刻开始发电，并和老电厂并车。郑州市现有的工厂和正在新建扩建的十多个工厂，从此就可得到更加充足的电力供应。这个发电厂不久以后还要和豫北豫西的重要城市和工矿区的电力联结起来，并向这些地方供电，以适应工业发展的需要。
    郑州发电厂是苏联全面援助我国新建和改建的规模巨大的企业中的一个。从开始建筑安装到机器运转发电仅十个多月。在建厂过程中，先后有二十多位苏联专家在各方面进行技术指导，他们提出的建议有数千条。苏联专家并用各种方法培养出一批具有独立建设能力的中国技术人员和技术工人，因此保证了工程进度和质量。汽轮发电机和蒸汽锅炉从开始试运转到正式发电，都表明它的质量的优异。当庞大复杂的机器开始运转的时刻，操纵着机器的只有很少的工人，他们工作得很愉快。在锅炉汽机电汽车间里，安装有一套仪表，上面有许多指针来回移动，表示着机器运行的情况；车间的所有设备也由电钮控制。配电间里虽然没有人，但只要把主控制室的远方开关一扭，也和有人操作一样发出很大的合闸声。仪表上还有信号灯和警报器的装置，如果那里可能出事故，坐在车间里就可以知道。给煤系统整个过程都是用机器代替人力，只要按一下电钮，煤就顺着长长的传送皮带送入磨煤机，磨成煤粉，吹送到锅炉里去。烧过七年锅炉的工人朱秀山，轻快地看着一台磨煤机。锅炉工人不再是满身乌黑，而是穿着白工作服站在机器旁当机器的指挥官了。    （新华社）
