    The Tenth Anniversary of the People's Polish Army
    By Major General Witold Szerzewski, Deputy Minister of National Defense and Director of the Political Department of Poland

    On October 12th, the Polish armed forces, together with all the Polish people, are celebrating their annual Army Day. This year's celebration will be particularly grand, as it marks the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Polish Army.

    The People's Polish Army was established during the period when our country suffered under Hitler's enslavement.

    Hitler fascism, fostered by US and British monopoly capital, launched a robber-like attack on Poland in September 1939, initiating World War II. The unprecedented defeat suffered by the Polish government in just a few days exposed the appalling betrayal and bankruptcy of the Polish landlords and capitalists, and clearly demonstrated the decay of the entire bourgeois regime. Blinded by hatred of the Soviet Union, the Polish bourgeoisie and reactionary rulers tried to divert the Polish people's attention from their mortal enemy – Hitler fascism. They drafted war plans to unite with Hitler against the Soviet Union, selling out the Polish people and paving the way for Hitler's aggression.

    Although the soldiers – workers and peasants – abandoned by the commanders who betrayed the motherland fought heroically, our country was ultimately occupied by the Hitler aggressors due to its poorly prepared national defense.

    The night of occupation shrouded our country. The Hitler occupiers tried to turn Poland into a large concentration camp, looting our property, destroying our culture, and massacring the best sons and daughters of the people, trying to turn the Polish people into enslaved people.

    The occupiers turned Polish cities and villages into rubble and fire pits. Of the 30,000 industrial enterprises that existed at the time, 19,000 were destroyed and burned. In the countryside, 467,000 peasant houses were destroyed, which means that almost a quarter of the peasant houses in the country were destroyed. Our historically significant capital, Warsaw, was almost razed to the ground by the aggressors. Six million Polish citizens died at the hands of Hitler's executioners. By the end of military operations, not a single Polish family had not mourned the loss of their loved ones.

    Even when the Hitler occupiers were destroying and looting our country, and millions were dying in the crematoria, our reactionary groups continued their disastrous anti-national, anti-people, and fanatically anti-Soviet policies at home and abroad, trying to divert the people's struggle against the Hitlerites who enslaved Poland.

    But the Polish people did not succumb to the Hitler bandits. Tens of thousands of workers, peasants, intellectuals, and young people participated in the sacred struggle to liberate the motherland. Leading the struggle for the liberation of the Polish people was the vanguard of the working class – the Polish Workers' Party.

    The Polish Workers' Party implemented the slogan of armed struggle against the occupiers and established its own armed organization – the People's Guard, which was later reorganized into the People's Army. The People's Guard and the People's Army were the foundation for organizing a broad front of national armed struggle against the aggressors.

    The People's Army was the armed force of the Polish people in the struggle for national and social liberation. The soldiers of the People's Army understood that the Party was leading them in the struggle for the independence of the motherland, in which the workers and peasants, not the bourgeoisie, would hold power. The Polish Workers' Party educated the soldiers of the People's Army in the spirit of fraternal friendship with the Soviet Union. The soldiers of the People's Army, like all the Polish people, understood that the Soviet army, which had crushed the Hitler army on the front line, was fighting not only to liberate its own motherland but also to liberate all the peoples enslaved by the Hitlerites. Therefore, the soldiers of the People's Army did everything they could to help the Soviet army win victory. The soldiers of the People's Army helped the Soviet army win victory by blowing up trains carrying military supplies, ammunition, and Hitler soldiers to the Soviet-German front.

    The war threw tens of thousands of Poles into Soviet territory, burning with the desire to fight the fascist aggressors.

    In 1943, Polish expatriates began to mobilize all their forces to support the fighting motherland, in order to combine the efforts of Polish expatriates with the struggles of the people and democratic forces at home. The Polish Communists led this movement. At their initiative, the Union of Polish Patriots was established, which proposed to organize the Polish regular army on the basis of friendship with the Soviet Union and obtaining its assistance, in order to strive for national and social liberation.

    The Soviet government and Comrade Stalin warmly supported this initiative of the Polish patriots. The Soviet government and Comrade Stalin believed in the Polish people, trusted them, and correctly estimated their love of freedom and their fearless spirit for the liberation of the motherland.

    In May 1943, the first Polish infantry division, named after the Polish national hero Tadeusz Kościuszko, began to be formed on Soviet territory.

    On October 12, 1943, the Tadeusz Kościuszko First Division victoriously conducted its first battle near the town of Lenino in Belarus. Filled with love for the motherland and hatred for the enemy, the Polish soldiers bravely and gloriously completed the task assigned by the command. The day of the battle near Lenino, the first major battle fought side by side by the regular troops of the Polish People's Army and the invincible Soviet Army, has been designated as the great festival of Polish soldiers – Polish Army Day. Near Lenino, Polish soldiers began their glorious fighting path for the liberation of the motherland. The blood shed together by Polish and Soviet soldiers near Lenino linked the armies of the two countries with inseparable friendship.

    The Soviet people's love for the motherland, their selfless examples of heroism in fighting on the front lines, and their hatred for the enemy – the Hitler aggressors – were the motivations for countless Polish patriots to voluntarily join the army. Therefore, when the first Polish division began to fight on the front lines alongside the Soviet army, the Polish army was already continuing to be built in the Soviet Union. In total, a powerful and well-equipped Polish army of 100,000 people was established in the Soviet Union. The performance of the Union of Polish Patriots and the First Polish Army also reflected the wishes of the Polish Workers' Party, the People's Guard, and the People's Army at home.

    In July 1944, the Soviet army and the Polish First Army, fighting side by side with it, crossed the Bug River on the Polish-Soviet border and began to liberate the territory of our country. The Polish people warmly welcomed the Soviet soldiers, treating them as their liberators, and at the same time they watched with pride and love our well-equipped army, ready to participate in the battle to liberate the entire country.

    After liberating the first few provinces of our country, the people's regime immediately promulgated a decree on merging the Polish First Army and the People's Army into the Polish Army, representing the armed forces of People's Poland.

    Despite the difficulties of the war, the Soviet Union still provided the Polish troops with the best weapons, supplies, and instructors. Comrade Bierut said: "The fact that our re-established Polish regular troops were able to fight victoriously on Polish soil alongside the Soviet army, that they were able to dedicate their blood and heroic deeds to the cause of liberating the motherland through the victorious battle road from Lenino to Berlin, is all due to the sincere friendship and assistance of the Soviet Union."

    The Polish army fought bravely to liberate our country and crush the Hitler army. Comrade Stalin, the Supreme Commander of the Soviet Army, repeatedly expressed his gratitude to our troops in his directives for the glorious battles they had fought.

    The Polish people have never had such a strong army as they have today in any period of history, and the Polish army has never been so loved by the people as it is today.

    Our army is the people's army, and it is fundamentally different from the army of landlord-capitalist Poland in the past. Its establishment was to liberate our country from Hitler's enslavement, and this task, with the fraternal help of the Soviet Union, has been brilliantly accomplished.

    Our army is the organ of our people's regime, and it has the mission of defending national independence. It is the first armed force of the working people in Polish history, and it faithfully serves the people.

    Our constitution states: "The armed forces of the Polish People's Republic are responsible for defending the sovereignty and independence, security, and peace of the Polish people."

    The working people of our country believe that the Polish army is the defender of their freedom and rights, and the protector of their peaceful labor. The working class and all working people send their best sons and daughters to our officer corps. They care about equipping and supplying the army as well as possible.

    Our army has a solid and powerful rear. The people's democratic system is the foundation of our motherland's strength, and relying on the people's democratic system has established the moral and political unity of society – this is the most enduring and inexhaustible source of strength. Poland is no longer a defenseless and isolated country. Now it can equip its army with the best modern weapons, and it can supply it with excellent cadres, young people who consciously treat their responsibilities selflessly.

    Our army is united like a rock. From the lowest commander to the highest commander are all sons of the people. Officers and soldiers are linked together by common goals and aspirations. Therefore, in our army, the spiritual and political unity of all members is being consolidated day by day.

    Our army is educated in the spirit of patriotism and internationalism and in the spirit of hating the imperialist murderers. This noble sentiment produces a high level of morality, enthusiasm, and selflessness, constantly improving combat effectiveness, and possessing a high degree of vigilance. Our army's education is built on the progressive traditions of the people, on the traditions of revolutionary struggle and heroism and selflessness of the Polish working masses, traditions that they inherited from the soldiers of the People's Guard and the People's Army, and from the soldiers of the First and Second Armies who passed through the glorious battle road from Lenino to Berlin.

    Our army has well-trained and experienced commanders. Our officers and junior commanders are learning the combat experience of the Soviet and Polish armies, relying on advanced Soviet military science, and fully mastering military art. Therefore, at the first sign that the enemy dares to attack our country, they can better lead our army to fight the enemy.

    The leadership, organization, and educational role of the Polish United Workers' Party is a powerful source of strength for our People's Army. The leaders of the Polish workers' revolutionary movement, the best sons of the motherland, organized and educated our People's Army. Whether in wartime or in peacetime, the Party, as the leading force of the people, has always educated the army in the spirit of patriotism and internationalism, in the spirit of loving the people and the motherland, loving the people's government, loving the regime of workers and peasants; in the spirit of loving and respecting the Soviet Union, and in the feeling of firm unity with the fraternal armies of the people's democratic countries, and with all forces of progress and peace. The Party and political organs of our army, the Party organizations in the army, and the organizations of the Polish Youth League, are raising the consciousness of our soldiers and inspiring their enthusiasm for science and service.

    The Polish people are proud that Marshal of Poland Konstantin Rokossovsky, a talented and experienced commander from Stalin's military school, is the commander of the armed forces of our people's country.

    Our army has close ties with the invincible Soviet army in combat and ideology. In the struggle against the Hitler bandits, the Polish army, relying on close cooperation with the Soviet army in combat, was able to complete its great task in the struggle for the independence of the motherland.

    Now, as Comrade Bierut, the leader of the Polish people, said, "Our army is loved by all the people, is cared for by our country which is linked by inseparable friendship with the ever-victorious Soviet Union and all the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism, our army can crush any attempt by the aggressors to invade the borders of People's Poland, and can defend Poland's freedom and the great cause of peace."

    The army of People's Poland is celebrating its glorious tenth anniversary. Inspired by the heroic struggle of the Polish working people to complete the Six-Year Plan, our soldiers are welcoming the tenth anniversary of Polish Army Day with new achievements in military and political training. Our people think of their army with pride and love – a reliable defender of the motherland's independence, our socialist construction, and peace.

    人民波兰军队的十周年
    波兰国防部副部长兼政治部主任  维泰歇热夫斯基少将
    十月十二日，波兰的武装力量同波兰全体人民一道庆祝自己一年一度的建军节。今年这一天的庆祝将特别隆重，因为它是波兰人民军创立的十周年。
    波兰人民军是在我国遭受希特勒奴役的时期中建立的。
    由美、英垄断资本所扶植起来的希特勒法西斯主义，在一九三九年九月对波兰实行强盗式的进攻，发动了第二次世界大战。波兰政府在短短的几天中所遭到的史无先例的溃败，暴露了波兰地主资本家的统治的全部骇人听闻的背叛行为和破产，明显地表示出资产阶级全部政权机构的腐朽。由于仇恨苏联而丧失理智的波兰资产阶级和反动统治者，竭力转移波兰人民对他们的死敌——希特勒法西斯主义的注意力。他们拟定同希特勒联合反对苏联的战争计划，出卖波兰人民，为希特勒的侵略铺平道路。
    虽然被叛卖祖国的统帅弃之不顾的士兵们——工人和农民们——曾进行了英勇的战斗，但我国终因没有准备良好的国防，而为希特勒侵略者所占领。
    占领的黑夜笼罩了我国。希特勒占领者们竭力想把波兰变成一个大的集中营，他们掠夺我们的财产，毁灭我们的文化，屠杀人民中的优秀儿女，想使波兰人民变为被奴役的人民。
    占领者把波兰的城市和乡村变成了瓦砾与火场。当时存在的三万个工业企业中便有一万九千个被破坏和烧毁。在农村中，有四十六万七千所农民的宅地被毁掉；也就是说，全国农民的宅地几乎有四分之一被毁。我国历史悠久的首都华沙几乎已被侵略者夷为平地。六百万波兰的公民死于希特勒刽子手的手里。在军事行动终止时，没有一个波兰家庭未曾因失掉自己的亲人而恸哭过。
    甚至在希特勒占领者毁坏和掠夺我国、千百万人葬身烧人炉的时候，我国的反动集团仍然在国内和国外继续他们遭致覆灭的反国家、反人民的疯狂仇视苏联的政策，企图转移人民反对奴役波兰的希特勒分子的斗争。
    但是波兰人民没有向希特勒强盗屈膝。成千成万的工人、农民、知识分子和青年参加了解放祖国的神圣斗争。领导着解放波兰人民斗争的便是工人阶级的先锋队——波兰工人党。
    波兰工人党实行了对占领者进行武装斗争的口号，建立了自己的武装机构——人民近卫军，后来把它改组为人民军。人民近卫军和人民军便是组织广大的民族武装斗争阵线以反对侵略者的基础。
    人民军是波兰人民为争取民族解放和社会解放而斗争的武装力量。人民军的士兵们懂得，党在领导他们为祖国独立而斗争，在这个国家中，将是工农而不是资产阶级来掌握政权。波兰工人党以对苏联的兄弟友爱精神教育人民军的士兵。人民军的士兵也同所有的波兰人民一样，懂得在前线粉碎了希特勒军队的苏军不仅是为解放自己的祖国，而且也是为解放所有被希特勒分子所奴役的各国人民而战斗。因此，人民军的士兵曾以全力来帮助苏军取得胜利。人民军的士兵们炸毁开往苏德前线的载有军火、弹药和希特勒兵士的列车，以此帮助苏军赢得胜利。
    战争把成千成万的波兰人投入苏联境内，他们燃烧着和法西斯侵略者进行战斗的愿望。
    一九四三年，波兰外侨开始动员一切力量来支援战斗中的祖国，以便把波兰旅外侨民的努力同国内人民和民主力量的斗争结合起来。波兰共产党人领导了这一运动。在他们的发起下，成立了波兰爱国者同盟，这个同盟提出了在同苏联友好并取得它的援助的基础上组织波兰正规军，以争取民族和社会解放。
    苏联政府和斯大林同志热烈地支持了波兰爱国者的这个创议。苏联政府和斯大林同志相信波兰人民，信任他们，并正确地估计到他们对自由的热爱和为解放祖国的奋不顾身的精神。
    一九四三年五月在苏联的领土上开始组成了第一个波兰的步兵师，这个步兵师是以波兰民族英雄塔吉乌斯·柯斯秋什柯的名字命名的。
    一九四三年十月十二日，塔吉乌斯·柯斯秋什柯第一师在白俄罗斯的列宁诺镇附近胜利地进行了第一次战役。充满了热爱祖国和仇恨敌人的感情的波兰士兵们，英勇地和光荣地完成了统帅部所提出的任务。列宁诺附近的战役，这个由波兰人民军的正规部队和所向无敌的苏军肩并肩所进行的首次大战役的日子已被定为波兰士兵的伟大节日——波兰建军节。在列宁诺附近，波兰士兵们开始了他们争取祖国解放的辉煌的战斗道路。波兰和苏联士兵们在列宁诺附近一起流的血，以不可分割的友爱将两国的军队连结起来。
    苏联人对祖国的热爱，他们在前线战斗时奋不顾身的英雄范例，对敌人—希特勒侵略者的仇恨，是无数波兰爱国志士自愿参军的动机。因此，当波兰的第一师同苏军一起在前线开始战斗时，在苏联境内就已又在继续建立波兰军了。在苏联一共建立了十万人的强有力的和装备优良的波兰军队。波兰爱国者同盟和波兰第一军的表现，也正是在国内的波兰工人党、人民近卫军和人民军的意愿。
    一九四四年七月，苏军和同它并肩作战的波兰第一军强渡过波苏边境的布格河，开始解放我国的领土。波兰人民热烈欢迎着苏军士兵，把他们当作自己的解放者，同时他们也带着自豪和热爱注视着装备优良，准备参加解放全国战斗的我国的军队。
    在解放我国的头几个省后，人民政权便立刻颁布了关于把波兰第一军和人民军合并为一个代表人民波兰的武装力量的波兰军。
    虽有战争的困难，苏联仍给波兰的部队以最好的武器、给养和教官。贝鲁特同志曾说：“我们重新建立的波军正规部队能够和苏军共同在波兰的土地上胜利地作战，他们能够通过由列宁诺到柏林的胜利的战斗道路，把他们的血和英雄行为献给祖国的解放事业，这都应当归功于苏联的真诚友爱和帮助。”
    波兰军队曾英勇地为解放我国和粉碎希特勒军队而战。苏军最高统帅斯大林同志在他的指令中曾多次因我国部队所进行的辉煌战役而向他们表示谢意。
    波兰人民在历史上任何时期都未曾拥有像它今天所有的这样强大的军队，波兰的军队更从没有像今天这样受到人民的热爱。
    我们的军队是人民的军队，它根本不同于过去地主资本家波兰的军队。它的建立是为了要把我国由希特勒奴役下解放出来，而这个任务，在苏联兄弟般的帮助下，已辉煌地完成。
    我们的军队是我们人民政权的机关，负有保卫国家独立的使命。它在波兰人民的历史上是第一支劳动人民的武装力量，它忠诚地服务于人民。
    我们的宪法上说：“波兰人民共和国的武装力量职在保卫波兰人民的主权与独立，安全与和平。”
    我国的劳动人民认为波兰的军队就是自己的自由和权利的保卫者，是自己的和平劳动的保护者。工人阶级和全体劳动人民把自己优秀的儿女送到我们的军官团里去。他们关心使军队尽可能地得到更好的装备和给养。
    我们的军队有牢固的和有力的后方。人民民主制度是我们祖国力量的基础，依靠着人民民主制度建立了社会的道德和政治上的团结一致——这是最持久的和用之不竭的力量的泉源。波兰再不是一个没有防卫的和孤立无援的国家。现在它能够用最好的现代武器把自己的军队装备起来，能够供给它优秀的干部，自觉地对待自己责任的忘我的青年。
    我们的军队像磐石一样团结在一起。从最低的指挥员到最高的指挥员都是人民的儿子。军官们和战士们为共同目标和志向联系在一起。因此在我们的军队里，一切成员的精神上和政治上的团结一致在日益巩固着。
    我们的军队是在爱国主义和国际主义的精神和痛恨帝国主义杀人凶手的精神中教育起来的。这种高贵的感情产生了高度的道德水平，产生了热情和忘我的精神，战斗力不断提高，并具有高度的警惕性。我们的军队的教育是建筑在人民的进步的传统上，建筑在波兰劳动群众革命斗争传统和英雄主义与忘我精神的传统的基础上，这些传统是他们从人民近卫军和人民军的战士，从通过了由列宁诺到柏林这样一条光荣的战斗道路的第一军和第二军的战士那里继承的。
    我们的军队有受过良好训练的、受过锻炼的指挥员。我们的军官和下级指挥员学习着苏军和波兰军队的战斗经验，依靠着先进的苏联军事科学，完全掌握了军事艺术。因此，一见敌人胆敢进攻我国，他们能更好地使我们的军队和敌人进行战斗。
    波兰统一工人党的领导、组织和教育的作用，就是我们人民军队力量的强有力的泉源。波兰的工人革命运动的领导者、祖国最优秀的儿子组织了和教育了我们的人民军队。无论在战时或在和平的时候，作为人民的领导力量的党，过去和现在都用爱国主义和国际主义的精神教育军队，用爱人民和祖国，爱人民政府，爱工农的政权的精神；用爱和尊敬苏联的精神，以及和人民民主国家的兄弟的军队，和进步与和平的一切力量的牢固团结的感情来教育军队。我们军队的党和政治机关、军队里的党组织和波兰青年联盟的组织，提高着我们战士的觉悟，并激发起他们对科学和服务的热情。
    波兰人民引为骄傲的是：斯大林的军事学校的天才的和有经验的指挥员——波兰元帅康斯坦丁·罗科索夫斯基是我们人民国家武装力量的指挥员。
    我们的军队在战斗上和思想上与无敌的苏军有着密切的联系。在与希特勒强盗的斗争中，波兰军队依靠着与苏军在作战方面的密切合作能够在争取祖国独立的斗争中完成自己的伟大任务。
    现在正如波兰人民的领袖贝鲁特同志所说，“我们的军队是为全体人民所爱戴的，是为与常胜的苏联和和平、民主与社会主义阵营的一切力量有着不可分割的友谊联系的我们国家所关怀的，我们的军队能够粉碎侵略者侵犯人民波兰边境的任何企图，能够捍卫波兰的自由和伟大的和平事业”。
    人民波兰的军队在庆祝自己的光荣的十周年。为波兰劳动人民争取完成六年计划的英勇斗争所鼓舞的我们的战士们，以军事和政治训练方面的新成就来迎接波兰建军节十周年。我国人民满怀自豪和热爱来想到自己的军队——祖国独立、我们的社会主义建设与和平的可靠的保卫者。
