    Northeast Region State-Owned Department Store System
    Organizes Purchases Based on New Circumstances to Welcome the Peak Season
    The Northeast Region State-Owned Department Store System is actively organizing sources of goods to prepare for the market supply during the peak season after the autumn harvest. It has already purchased over 1 trillion yuan worth of industrial products from state-owned factories and local state-owned factories within the region. Eighty percent of these products will be supplied to meet the needs of the people in the Northeast Region in the fourth quarter. At the same time, it has ordered a large number of seasonal fabrics from the Northeast Textile Industry and local small industries for processing. In addition, based on the winter needs of the Northeast region, it has organized local handicraftsmen to produce various fur and felt cotton products, worth 180 billion yuan. Together with various winter goods ordered from within and outside the region, the total amounts to about 700 billion yuan.

    In the first half of this year, state-owned department stores have already sold a large number of industrial products in cities and villages in the Northeast. Moreover, the consumption of many commodities is constantly increasing. Bicycles, which began to sell well last year, sold another 42,000 units in the first half of this year, most of which were purchased by urban workers. The consumption of thermos bottles and ready-made clothing has also increased rapidly. In the first half of the year, the entire region sold 660,000 thermos bottles; in the clothing category, shirts and trousers alone reached 4.33 million pieces. In Harbin, state-owned department stores only sold a few hundred sets of men's and women's cadre uniforms in the first half of last year, but supplied more than 40,000 sets in the first half of this year. In rural areas, the biggest change in consumption is in fabrics. In Heilongjiang Province, a grain-producing area, more than 1.2 million bolts of various fabrics were sold from state-owned stores in the first half of the year, an increase of more than 300,000 bolts compared to the same period last year. Two years ago, the consumption of twill fabric in this area accounted for only one-tenth of the total fabric consumption, but now it has reached three-tenths; conversely, the consumption of coarse cloth has decreased from three-tenths to one-tenth.

    Currently, crops are growing well throughout the region, and a bumper harvest is expected. The market is expected to be even more prosperous in the fourth quarter. Since the launch of grain, fresh fruits, and some special products, the sales volume of state-owned department stores in various places has gradually increased, increasing by 40 percent in late August compared to mid-August. Seasonal fabrics and cotton wadding have begun to sell well. Heilongjiang Province sold 100,000 bolts of cotton cloth and 90,000 catties of cotton wadding in ten days. However, the sales of cotton wadding did not start after the weather turned cold. In June of this year, the entire region sold 820,000 catties of cotton wadding, and people had already started taking apart and making cotton quilts and cotton clothes in the summer.

    The Northeast Region Company of China Department Store has ordered several hundred billion yuan worth of goods from within the customs based on the market needs after the autumn harvest. At this supply conference, it also wholesale and ordered a large number of goods from various state-owned industrial and local state-owned industrial factories in the Northeast Region. In the allocation and supply of these goods, attention was paid to the needs of farmers in grain-producing areas. Of the goods ordered from within the Northeast Region, 65 billion yuan will be supplied to Heilongjiang Province. In the fourth quarter of this year, state-owned department stores plan to supply nearly 1 million bolts of fabric in Heilongjiang Province, which means that each resident in the province will be able to buy an average of 18 chi of fabric in three months. Currently, transportation plans for goods from within and outside the region have been formulated, and some reserved existing goods have begun to be transported to consumer areas. Recently, many woolen sweaters have been shipped back from within the customs every day.

    In the production cities within the Northeast Region, state-owned department stores have organized a large number of handicraftsmen to produce fur and felt cotton winter goods. By the end of August, Songjiang Province had processed and purchased more than 200,000 fur hats. By the end of September, 360,000 hats will be placed in grassroots stores. Around October, 150,000 to 160,000 pairs of cotton-padded leather shoes will be processed from various handicraft workshops. This year's winter goods materials were prepared earlier, and raw materials were purchased as early as summer. The prepared quantity is much larger than last year, and the variety of winter goods is relatively complete.

    Based on the expansion of purchases within and outside the region, the Northeast Region Department Store System prepares to supply goods worth over 33 percent more than the same period last year in the fourth quarter to the people of the entire region. (Li Jiyao)

    东北区国营百货公司系统
    依据新情况组织进货迎接旺季
    东北区国营百货公司系统正积极组织货源，准备秋收后旺季市场的供应。现已从区内国营工厂和地方国营工厂购进一万多亿元的工业品，其中有百分之八十要在第四季度供应东北区内人民需要。同时，从国营东北纺织工业和地方小工业加工订购了大批的换季布匹。此外，根据东北地区的冬季需要，组织了地方手工业者生产各种毛皮和毡棉制品，价值达一千八百亿元，连同区内外订购的各种冬货，总计约为七千多亿元。
    今年上半年，国营百货公司已经在东北城市、乡村中售出了大量的工业产品。而且，许多商品的消费量在不断增加。从去年开始打开销路的自行车，今年上半年又销出了四万两千多台，这些自行车大部分都是被城市职工们购买去了。热水瓶和制成服装的消费量也增加得很快。上半年全区销出热水瓶六十六万个；服装类中仅衬衣裤一种即达四百三十三万件。哈尔滨市的国营百货商店，去年上半年只卖了男女干部服几百套，今年上半年就供应了四万多套。在农村里，消费量变化最大的是布匹。产粮区的黑龙江省，上半年中从国营商店里售出各种布匹一百二十多万匹，比去年同期增加三十多万匹。两年以前，这个地区的斜纹布消费量只占布匹消费量的十分之一，现在已经达到十分之三；相反的粗布消费量却从十分之三降为十分之一了。
    目前，全区庄稼正在成长，丰收有望，预计第四季度市场将更为畅旺。自粮食、鲜果和部分特产上市以后，各地国营百货公司的售货量即已逐渐增加，八月下旬比中旬增加了百分之四十。换季布匹和絮花开始畅销，黑龙江省在十天内销出棉布十万匹，絮花九万斤。但是，絮花销售并不是从天气转凉后开始的，今年六月全区即售出八十二万斤絮花，人们已经在夏季就开始拆做棉被、棉衣了。
    中国百货公司东北区公司根据秋收后的市场需要，已经从关内订购了数千亿元的商品，这次全区供应会议上又从东北区内国营工业和地方国营工业各厂包销、订购了大量商品。在这些商品的调配供应中，注意了产粮区的农民需要。从东北区内订购的商品中有六百五十亿元是供给黑龙江省的。今年第四季度国营百货公司准备在黑龙江省内供应的布匹近一百万匹，大约省内每个居民平均能够在三个月中买到十八尺布。现在，区内外的商品运输计划已经制订，部分储备的现存商品已经开始运往消费地区。最近每天从关内运回很多绒衣。
    在东北区内各生产城市，国营百货公司组织了大批手工业者生产毛皮、毡棉冬货。松江省到八月底已经加工、采购了二十多万顶皮帽子，到九月底将有三十六万顶摆到基层商店，十月前后将有十五、六万双棉皮鞋从各手工业小厂加工出来。今年的冬货物资准备动手较早，夏天就已经着手采购原料；准备的数量较去年增加很多；各种冬货的品种比较齐全。
    东北区百货系统在扩大区内外进货的基础上，准备在第四季度供应全区人民的百货商品总值将超过去年同期百分之三十三。　（李继尧）
