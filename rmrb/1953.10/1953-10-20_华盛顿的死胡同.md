    Washington's Dead End
    by Ilya Ehrenburg, Soviet Union
    It is not the first year that American and Western European newspapers have been filled with news about a new type of weapon used to slaughter millions of peaceful residents. These newspapers use philosophical essays, articles written by politicians and military personnel, maudlin novels, and even social news to discuss this weapon. Thoughts become more and more barren year by year, plans and speculations become increasingly absurd, and novels are even more nonsensical. One bomb replaces another. In recent weeks, interest in this killing weapon has become particularly intense. Editorials in American and Western European newspapers have begun to remind people of the spells of swindlers and idiots who predicted the inevitable cataclysm and doomsday in the bleakest Middle Ages of the year 999.
    In this policy, which was named "atomic bomb policy" by its creators and is now preparing to be renamed "hydrogen bomb policy," there are many sad and ridiculous things. The sad thing is that in some countries there are some shortsighted and malicious people who are determined to use the great scientists' major inventions to slaughter millions of old people, women and children, and to monopolize the world. I do not want to cite the激烈的speeches and articles of American congressmen who may not be included in the ranks of kind-hearted and rational people. When it comes to the brutality of this new killing weapon that is being talked about so much, I will only recall the past: it is hard to imagine a historian who can proudly talk about the destruction of Hiroshima. But, in the rush about atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, there are also some stupid and ridiculous elements: this is a fable about a person who wanted to rob everything, boasted and threatened to kill anyone who was not submissive, he wanted to intimidate everyone, but his intimidation finally intimidated himself.
    We remember how the fools living on the other side of the Atlantic praised the atomic bomb. They called it "Gilda," after a woman, and they sang its praises in articles and poems; cunning merchants called coffee pots, pen nibs, and even bras "atomic." Fools believed that with the help of the weapons they had created, they could force all nations to kneel. In fact, every rational person who understands history would have understood at that time that science would not develop only in one individual country, and if one country used new weapons to threaten another country, then the other country, in order to defend its own safety, would obtain the same weapons. An American scientist named Lapp warned his compatriots that it was ridiculous to expect to monopolize any kind of weapon, and that in the modern scientific situation, this plan was wishful thinking and self-deception. What American scientists understood was far from being understood by American diplomats. These American diplomats believed that by threatening with atomic weapons, they could seize the countries that had fallen into their nets, as well as those who were unwilling to give up their independence. The great invention of the scientists became a trump card in the hands of arrogant but not clever gamblers.
    Billions of people demanded a ban on the use of atomic weapons, and people from different countries and different political beliefs signed their names to the Stockholm Appeal. However, shortsighted politicians refused to consider the will of the people, and the philosophers, missionaries, and journalists under their control proved that the atomic bomb could protect "Western civilization" from the invasion of traitors. They planned to put "Gilda" in the shrine at the first sign of embarrassment -- when everyone knew that the atomic bomb was no longer monopolized by the United States. The naive inhabitants of the forty-eight states, who had been frightened by the boasting of killing weapons, were panicked. The Americans who were still praising "Gilda" last night suffered from neurasthenia, and newspapers reported many suicides. Some congressmen demanded that the Senate meetings be moved to tunnels under the mountains. Dexterous architects aroused the interest of sentimental entrepreneurs in underground official residences.
    But, the Soviet Union is peace-loving, and continues to maintain its position of condemning and banning the use of atomic weapons. So what should the shortsighted American politicians do? Perhaps they are willing to reach an agreement? No, they are determined to spread a new card, they are in a hurry to brag about the hydrogen bomb. "Gilda" was demoted, and a new favorite, "H-Bomb," replaced it.
    At that time, American and Western European newspapers used the terrible characteristics of the hydrogen bomb to frighten their readers, and they asserted that the Soviet Union, frightened by the "H-Bomb," would beg for mercy, which was as correct as two times two equals four. As a result, the hydrogen bomb was by no means a monopoly of the United States. So we saw a scene that was not unfamiliar: the person who frightened others, frightened himself out of his mind. Although everyone now knows that the Soviet Union is trying its best to ease international tensions, and that its foreign and domestic policies prove its peace-loving intentions, American diplomats make people believe that a great disaster has occurred: Oh my God, the other
    side has the most terrible weapon!
    Mr. Dulles declared not long ago that the hydrogen bomb threatened "the existence of civilization in the form that we know it." Although I respect the politicians of all countries, I cannot but point out the absurdity of this statement. For many years, the greatest scientists, sociologists, and writers of the five continents have been demanding a ban on the use of atomic weapons, pointing out that atomic weapons threaten civilization. But Mr. Dulles disagreed with their views at that time, he believed that this killing weapon, because it was only in the hands of his colleagues, was the savior of civilization. I do not know what Mr. Dulles means by the civilization "in the form that he knows it." Perhaps the civilization he is talking about does not refer to Moscow University, the Lenin Library, the writings of Joliot-Curie, the antiquities of Beijing, and other achievements of countries and people that his partners call "red." But why would the Soviet Union possessing the same weapons as the United States threaten the Capitol in Washington or the skyscrapers of New York?
    But American politicians, instead of trying to comfort their compatriots, are trying to create panic. On September 25, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission declared that the committee "will go to a secret place" and discuss the situation that has been created in a completely confidential state. On the same day, they pleased the residents of New York with "atomic bomb" alarm exercises: sirens wailed, radio stations broadcast inexplicable things, in order to confuse "enemy" planes; nervous people went crazy. Former Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Dean said smugly that because the Soviet Union also has hydrogen bombs, "it is necessary to fight to the death." Mr. Dean's impatience seems to be because the United States has more bombs. But he immediately contradicted himself again, he admitted that even if this bellicose Mr. Dean could destroy the enemy twice, this would not make him happy at all, because the enemy could destroy Mr. Dean himself, even if it was only once. As for the American generals, they are very skeptical of Mr. Dean's spells. It should be pointed out that the rain in Korea gave many neurasthenic people on the other side of the ocean a very beneficial shower, they ended up empty-handed in Panmunjom, which made them sober up a bit.
    We have witnessed the bankruptcy of a policy of blackmail, deception, and stupidity. Any criminal law scholar knows that people who engage in blackmail will be fooled sooner or later; their lies will be exposed sooner or later, and the stupidity of their behavior will become very clear. Washington has wide and well-connected avenues, not dead ends, this is in terms of the city's construction plan. But, the politicians who live in Washington and who used to intimidate people have entered a dead end, this is in terms of their strategic plans. Everyone understands that if a driver drives into a dead end, he should turn back. But, the politicians who live in Washington are unwilling to come out, they shout and make noise, brag and boast, and swear that they will continue to drive forward.
    Why are they so stubbornly implementing a policy of threats and deception? I think this is inseparable from the growing resistance of the people of all countries. There have been many changes in the world. It is a fact that, with the active assistance of American diplomats, the forces of revenge and aggression in West Germany have been revived. It is also a fact that General Franco has sold large tracts of Spanish land to strategists on the other side of the ocean. But, can the world be enslaved with the help of the remaining SS and Falangists?
    We see how the British people are increasingly determined to end the
    "Cold War". We see the rise of peace-loving forces in France and Italy (shortsighted American politicians talk about these countries with an undisguised anger, as if talking about a concubine who has betrayed his favor).
    We see the increasing prestige of countries that resist the "policy of strength" -- such as India. Finally, we also see that more and more people in the United States are demanding a peaceful resolution of disputes.
    Some of the Soviet government's measures, its clear proposals to seek ways to reach a mutually acceptable agreement, have stripped the believers in atomic and hydrogen bomb diplomacy of their last arguments. They can only talk nonsense.
    The Soviet Union, which is constantly threatened by the use of atomic and hydrogen bombs, has had to obtain the type of weapons used by the advocates of the "policy of strength" to intimidate it in order to protect its own security. But the Soviet Union has more than once proposed to condemn and ban the use of all types of weapons of mass human slaughter. The Soviet Union has both in the past and now suggested the establishment of international supervisory bodies, which would guarantee a real abandonment of atomic weapons, in order to reassure the whole world.
    The Soviet people understand that great inventions can be used to make people's lives more comfortable and happy, and they are watching with hope the labor of Soviet scientists aimed at the peaceful use of atomic energy. The tomorrow we think of is not ruins and massacres, but a century of labor and happiness.
    We will never praise all kinds of bombs, and we will never associate the victory of the advanced ideas of the twentieth century with the subversion of countries and the destruction of nations. We have never forced anyone to accept our way of life. Whenever the World Peace Council calls on the people of all countries to support any just proposal that can dispel the dark clouds and give mankind peace, the Soviet people always warmly support such a rational declaration. The Soviet people are convinced that all disputed issues can be resolved by peaceful means, resolutely advocate a complete ban on the use of atomic and hydrogen bombs, and at the same time they want to do their best to protect from destruction not only Moscow or Beijing, not only London and Paris, but also New York and Washington.
    The dispute over which way of life is superior should be resolved by peaceful creative labor, not by blind and malicious destruction. No matter what Mr. Dulles says, no matter what the neurasthenic Mr. Dean suggests, no matter how loud the alarms in New York ring, people all over the world, including Americans, would rather live than die. The people of all countries, including the Americans, want peace. If a few shortsighted American politicians have entered a dead end, then they can be advised to calm down, take a breath, and withdraw from the dead end. The people of the world are no longer willing to live a melancholy and uneasy life just because some diplomats on the other side of the Atlantic are irrational, not calm, and lack foresight. I believe that the people of the whole world, including the Americans, will force these diplomats to withdraw from the dead end. As for us Soviet people, we will do our best, with our labor, calmness, self-control, our friendly relations with the people of all countries including the American people, to bring about the days of true international peace and friendly cooperation.

    华盛顿的死胡同
    苏联　爱伦堡
    美国和西欧的报纸填满着关于那种用以屠杀千百万和平居民的新型武器的消息，已不是第一年了。这些报纸把哲学论文、政客们和军人们所写的文章、肉麻的小说，甚至社交界的新闻都用来谈论这个武器。思想一年比一年更枯涩，计划和臆测日益荒诞，小说更是胡说八道。一种炸弹接替着另一种炸弹。这几星期来，对于这种杀人武器的兴趣变得特别浓厚了。美国和西欧的报纸的社论开始使人回忆起九百九十九年那个最凄清的中世纪时代曾预言不可避免的天崩地裂和世界末日的那些骗子和白痴的咒语。
    在这个曾由它的制订者命名为“原子弹政策”和现在正准备改称为“氢弹政策”的政策中，有许多可悲的和可笑的事。可悲的是在某些国家里竟有一些短视的、心术不好的人决心利用伟大科学家的重大发明来屠杀千百万老人和妇孺，来独霸世界。我并不要引证那些未必能够列入有心肝和有理智的人群的美国国会议员们的激烈的演说和文章。当谈到为人谈论不休的这个新的杀人武器的残忍性时，我只限于回忆过去：很难设想会有一位历史学家，他能骄傲地谈论广岛的毁灭。但是，在关于原子弹和氢弹的奔忙中也有一些愚蠢的可笑的成分：这是关于一个人的寓言，这个人曾想抢劫一切，夸耀着而且威吓着要杀死任何不驯服的人，他曾想恐吓一切人，可是他的恐吓终于恐吓了自己。
    我们记得，住在大西洋彼岸的蠢人们曾怎样地称颂过原子弹。他们用“吉丽达”这个妇人的名字来称呼它，他们用文章和诗篇来歌颂它；狡黠的商人把咖啡壶、钢笔头、甚至乳罩都称为“原子”。蠢人们曾相信借助他们所创造的武器可以迫使所有的民族屈膝。实际上，每一个有理智的、懂得历史的人当时都会明白，科学不会单在一个个别国家里发展，如果一个国家用新的武器来恫吓另外一个国家，那末，另外的一个国家为了捍卫自己的安全，就会弄到同样的武器。有一位名叫莱普的美国科学家曾警告自己的同胞说，指望着垄断任何一种武器是可笑的，在现代的科学情况下，这种打算就是妄想、自欺。美国科学家所了解的这点，远非美国外交官们所能理解。这些美国外交官认为，用原子武器来威吓，他们可以把掉到自己网中来的国家，以及那些不甘愿放弃自己的独立的国家攫为己有。科学家的这种重大发明成了嚣张的但并不聪明的赌徒手中的王牌。
    亿万的人要求禁止使用原子武器，不同国家的、不同政治信仰的人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上都签上了自己的名字。但是，眼光短浅的政客们却拒绝考虑人民的意志，受他们所支配的哲学家、传教师、新闻记者都证明，原子弹可以保护“西方文明”免于背信者们的侵略。他们打算在第一次难为情的时候——大家都知道原子弹已不为美国所垄断的时候——把“吉丽达”放到神龛里去。被杀人武器的夸耀吓住了的天真的四十八州的庸人们张皇失措了。那些在昨夜还在赞扬“吉丽达”的美国人患上了神经衰弱症，而且报纸上报道了许多自杀事件。有些议员要求把参议院的会议搬到高山下的隧道里去开。灵巧的建筑师们使善感的事业家对地下官邸发生了兴趣。
    但是，苏联是酷爱和平的，而且继续保持自己谴责和禁止使用原子武器的主张。那么美国的短视的政治家们怎样办呢？也许他们愿意取得协议吧？不，他们决心摊出一张新牌，他们匆忙地吹嘘起氢弹来。“吉丽达”被降级了，新的嬖臣“H弹”代替了它。
    当时美国和西欧的报纸用氢弹的恐怖特性的危险来恐吓自己的读者，当时他们断定说，为“H弹”吓住了的苏联将会求饶，这就像二乘二得四一样正确。结果呢，氢弹绝不是美国的垄断物。于是我们看到了一幅并不生疏的情景：吓唬人的人，自己却把自己吓得失去了理智。虽说现在大家都知道，苏联尽力缓和国际的紧张局势，无论它的对外或对内的政策，都证明着它的爱好和平的意图，可是美国的外交官使人相信，好像发生了大灾祸：天啊，另
    一方面有了最可怕的武器了！
    杜勒斯先生不久以前宣称，氢弹威胁着“我们所知道的那种形式的文明的存在”。虽说我尊重各国的政治家，但是我不能不指出这种说法的荒诞可笑。多年以来，五大洲的最伟大的科学家、社会学家、作家一直在要求禁止使用原子武器，指出原子武器威胁着文明。而杜勒斯先生那时不同意他们的意见，他相信，这种杀人武器因为只握在他的同僚手中，所以是文明的拯救者。我不知道，杜勒斯先生所说的他“所知道的那种形式”的文明是指何而言。可能他所谈的文明决不是指莫斯科大学、列宁图书馆、约里奥·居里的著作、北京的古物和他的伙伴称为“赤色的”国家和人物的其他成就。    但是为什么苏联拥有美国所有的那种武器就会威胁到华盛顿的国会或纽约的摩天大楼呢？
    可是美国的政客们非但不想安慰他们的同胞，反而尽量制造恐慌。九月二十五日，原子能委员会主席曾宣称，委员会“将到一个秘密的地方去”，而且要在一种完全保守秘密的状态商讨已造成的局势。就在这同一天，他们用“原子弹的”警报演习而使纽约居民高兴：汽笛吼叫，广播电台广播莫名其妙的事情，为的是使“敌人的”飞机错乱起来；神经质的人疯狂了。前原子能委员会主席狄安先生自鸣得意地说，因为苏联也有了氢弹，“所以，必须一决雌雄”。狄安先生所以不耐烦的原因，好像是美国拥有更多的炸弹。但是他立刻又自相矛盾起来，他承认，即使是这位好战的狄安先生能够消灭敌人两次，这也一点不能使他高兴的，因为敌人可能消灭狄安先生本人，即使是一次。至于美国的将军们，他们对于狄安先生的咒语是非常怀疑的。应当指出，朝鲜的雨使大洋彼岸的许多神经衰弱的人洗了一次很有好处的淋浴，他们在板门店落得一场空，多少使他们清醒一点。
    我们亲眼看到讹诈、欺骗和愚蠢的政策的破产。任何一个刑法学者都知道，从事讹诈的人早晚会上当的；他的谎言早晚会被揭穿的，他的行为的愚蠢就显得很清楚了。华盛顿有四通八达的大道，没有死胡同，这是从城市的建筑计划来说。但是，住在华盛顿的和过去惯于威吓人的政客们走进了死胡同，这是从他们的战略计划来看。谁都明白，司机开进了死胡同就应当转回来。但是，住在华盛顿的政客们却不愿意走出来，他们大叫大闹，自吹自擂，发誓地说他们要一直往前开。
    他们这样顽固地执行威胁和欺骗的政策是为了什么呢？我认为这与各国人民的日益增长的反抗是分不开的。世界上已有了许多变化。这是事实，在美国外交官们的积极协助下，西德的报复和侵略的力量复活了。这也是事实，佛朗哥将军把西班牙的大块土地卖给了大洋彼岸的战略家。可是，借助残余的党卫军和长枪党人就能够奴役世界吗？……
    我们看到英国人民怎样愈来愈坚决地要求结束
    “冷战”。我们看到法国和意大利的爱好和平力量的高涨（美国短视的政客们用一种掩饰不住的愤怒谈论着这些国家，就像谈论着辜负他的恩宠的臣妾一样）。
    我们看到抗拒“实力政策”的国家——如印度——的威望的提高。最后我们还看到美国有愈来愈多的人要求和平解决争端。
    苏联政府的一些措施，它为达成大家都能接受的协议而寻求途径的明显建议，已剥夺了原子弹和氢弹外交的信徒的最后论据。他们只能胡言乱语了。
    遭受到使用原子弹和氢弹的不断威胁的苏联，它为了保卫自己的安全不得不弄到“实力政策”拥护者们用来威吓它的那种类型的武器。但是苏联曾不止一次地建议谴责和禁止使用各种类型的大规模屠杀人类的武器。苏联不论过去和现在都建议建立国际监督的机构，这种监督机构保证真正放弃原子武器，以此告慰全世界。
    苏联人明白，伟大的发明是能够用来使人们的生活变得更舒适美满起来，他们满怀希望地注视着旨在和平使用原子能的苏联科学家的劳动。我们所想的明天不是废墟和大屠杀，而是劳动和幸福的世纪。
    我们从来不会赞美各种各样的炸弹，任何时候我们也不会把二十世纪的先进思想的胜利和国家的颠覆与民族的灭亡联系起来。我们从来没有强迫任何人接受我们的生活方式。每当世界和平理事会向各国人民呼吁支持能够吹散阴云和给人类以安宁的任何公正的建议时，苏联人民总是热烈地拥护这种合理的宣言。苏联人民深信，用和平的方法可以解决一切争执的问题，坚决主张完全禁止使用原子弹和氢弹，同时他们所要尽力保护以免于毁灭的，不只是莫斯科或北京，不只是伦敦和巴黎，而且也是纽约和华盛顿。
    关于这种或那种生活方式来得优越的争执应当由和平的创造性的劳动来解决，而不是由盲目的、恶毒的毁灭来解决。不论杜勒斯先生说什么，不论神经失常的狄安先生建议些什么，不论纽约的警报拉得多响，全世界的人们，包括美国人在内，都愿意活而不愿意死。各国人民，包括美国人在内，都要和平。如果几个短视的美国政客们走进了死胡同，那末可以劝他们冷静一点，歇一口气，退出死胡同。全世界的人民都不再愿意只是因为某些大西洋彼岸的外交官没有理智，不冷静，缺乏远见，而过着忧郁不安的生活。我相信，全世界人民，包括美国人在内，将迫使这些外交官退出死胡同。至于我们苏联人民，我们将尽全力，用我们的劳动、冷静、自制、我们与各国人民包括美国人民在内的友好关系，来使国际间真正和平和友好合作的日子来到。（刘竞译自十月三日苏联“真理报”）
