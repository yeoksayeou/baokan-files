Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 20th: The World Trade Union Third Congress concluded its discussion of Vittorio's report on the morning of the 18th. At the afternoon session, Ruslan Wijajasastra, Deputy Secretary-General of the Indonesian Central Trade Union, presented a report on the third agenda item, "Developing the Trade Union Movement in Colonial and Semi-Colonial Countries."

At the morning session, representatives from Trieste, Tunisia, Brazil, Dakar and Senegal, Cameroon, Uruguay, Chile, and Luxembourg spoke. Subsequently, Vittorio delivered a concluding speech on the discussion of the second agenda item report, stating that the discussion was very important and demonstrated that the delegates agreed on three points in the report: first, it is necessary to be proactive in striving for economic progress and improved living conditions; second, trade unions must strive for national independence—not only trade unions in colonial and semi-colonial countries, but also those in capitalist countries dependent on the United States; and third, trade unions must fight to defend democratic rights and freedoms.

Vittorio suggested that the congress strongly protest the repressive policies of the British authorities in British Guiana and express solidarity with the people of British Guiana. He pointed out that the national liberation movement in colonial and semi-colonial countries is rising. He said that the Soviet Union is an inspiring example for all peoples struggling for a better future under capitalist oppression, which aroused stormy applause.

Vittorio said that the World Federation of Trade Unions' action plan regarding economic demands can be applied simultaneously to colonial countries and economically developed capitalist countries. However, a mechanical approach should not be adopted, but specific circumstances should be considered, and this plan should be implemented according to an appropriate assessment of current problems. In the struggle to improve the economic situation of working people, the working class must win over the middle class. He concluded by expressing his belief that the World Federation of Trade Unions Third Congress will further elevate the struggle of the working masses against exploitation and poverty.

At the afternoon session, Wijajasastra presented a report on the third agenda item, stating that in the four years since the Second World Trade Union Congress, the living and working conditions of workers in colonial and semi-colonial countries have deteriorated. The real wages in some of these countries are almost half of the pre-war level, millions of men and women are semi-employed or unemployed, and various forms of forced labor still exist in many countries. Workers' wages are very low, and living conditions are very poor. All colonial regions practice racial discrimination, which is reflected in workers' wages, social status, and political rights. The main reason for the miserable living conditions of workers in colonial and semi-colonial countries is the imperialist policy of plunder.

Wijajasastra pointed out that foreign monopoly capital hinders the development of industry and agriculture in colonial and semi-colonial countries and seeks huge profits by impoverishing the working people of those countries. In order to maintain their economic hegemony in colonial and semi-colonial countries, imperialists resort to the most brutal methods, including wars of aggression. They also use racial discrimination and cultural poisoning. However, these methods have aroused increasingly strong national sentiments, which are embodied in powerful national liberation movements. Wijajasastra pointed out that the great victory of the Chinese people has shaken the imperialist control over the East, and the victory achieved by the Korean people with the support of the Chinese people and other peace-loving people demonstrates that imperialism can no longer restore its former position. The rapid development of the national liberation movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries is one of the main factors in the post-war international situation that is contributing to the collapse of the entire colonial system. Another factor deepening the crisis of the colonial system is the struggle among imperialist countries for economic and political hegemony in the colonies.

Wijajasastra pointed out that since World War II, the trade union movement in colonial and semi-colonial countries has made great progress, and the establishment of the World Federation of Trade Unions has had a significant impact on the development of the trade union movement in these countries. He said that although the trade union movement in colonial and semi-colonial countries has encountered serious difficulties due to the suppression and divisive activities of imperialists and their agents, the trade union movement is still growing rapidly, and workers are increasingly taking united action in their struggles.

Wijajasastra then spoke in detail about the tasks of trade unions in colonial and semi-colonial countries. He said that the most important task is to organize constant struggles to defend and strive for social and economic welfare. Trade union organizations in various countries must carefully study the economic and social demands of workers in order to formulate practical plans. To implement these plans, it is crucial to obtain the support of other strata of people, especially farmers, artisans, and small merchants, for the workers' struggle. Trade union organizations in colonial and semi-colonial countries have had much experience in workers gaining the support of other strata of people. In some cases, they have even formed a united front to lead the struggle to achieve common demands. Another issue of great importance to workers in colonial and semi-colonial countries is the defense of trade union rights and the struggle for trade union rights where they have not yet been recognized.

Wijajasastra emphasized the importance of united worker action and international solidarity of working people. He then said:

In reviewing the actions of the working class in recent years, one can see this important fact: the workers' struggle to meet their economic and social demands is closely linked to the national liberation movement and the peace movement. And the national liberation movement and the peace movement, in turn, have promoted the development and consolidation of the trade union movement in colonial and semi-colonial countries.

The trade union movement in colonial and semi-colonial countries is facing an important task: to establish the closest possible relationship with all workers, regardless of their political views, the trade union to which they belong, and their race and religious beliefs. Wijajasastra pointed out that the trade union movement in colonial and dependent countries should absorb broad masses of workers into the international movement for peace, against the imperialist wars of aggression in Vietnam and Malaya, and against the establishment of military bases by imperialism. Trade unions must support the peasants' struggle for land reform to improve their living conditions, help them organize, and explain to them in various ways the importance of mutual support between workers and peasants. The unity of workers and peasants is the most powerful force in the national liberation movement.

He said that in the struggle to achieve economic independence, oppose the rule of monopoly capital, support the development of international trade, national industries, and international economic cooperation on an equal footing, trade unions should play an active role. Trade unions should organize the broad masses of workers and unite them in the great patriotic movement, so that they can play a leading role in the national united front comprising all strata of people. He concluded by saying that it is necessary to strengthen the links between the trade union movement in colonial and semi-colonial countries and the trade union movement in the suzerain states, establish links between workers in colonial and semi-colonial countries, and ensure the unity of their actions; and strengthen the links with the workers and trade union organizations of the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries.

    世界工会代表大会继续开会
    印尼代表就第三项议程作报告
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：世界工会第三次代表大会十八日上午结束了维多里奥报告的讨论，在下午会议上，印尼总工会副总书记鲁斯兰·维佳佳萨斯特拉就第三项议程“开展殖民地和半殖民地国家中的工会运动”作了报告。
    在上午会议上，的里雅斯特、突尼斯、巴西、达喀尔与塞内加尔、喀麦隆、乌拉圭、智利、卢森堡的代表先后发言。接着，维多里奥就第二项议程报告的讨论作了总结发言，他说这个报告的讨论是十分重要的，讨论情况说明，代表们同意报告中的三点，即必须表现主动性来争取经济进步和改善生活条件；工会必须努力争取民族独立——不仅是殖民地和半殖民地国家的工会，而且还有依靠美国的资本主义国家的工会；工会必须为保卫民主权利与自由而斗争。
    维多里奥建议大会坚决抗议英国当局在英属圭亚那的镇压政策，并表示对英属圭亚那人民的声援。他指出殖民地和半殖民地国家中民族解放运动正日益高涨。他说，对于在资本主义压迫下正在为美好未来而斗争的各国人民，苏联是一个令人鼓舞的榜样，他的话引起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    维多里奥说，世界工联在经济要求方面的行动方针可以同时适用于殖民地国家和经济发达的资本主义国家。但是，不应采取机械的方式，而应该考虑具体情况，按照对当前问题的适当估计来执行这一方针。工人阶级在争取改善劳动人民经济情况的斗争中，必须把中产阶级争取过来。他最后表示相信，世界工联第三次代表大会将把劳动群众反对剥削和贫困的斗争更加提高一步。
    在下午会议上，维佳佳萨斯特拉就第三项议程作报告，他说：在世界工会第二次代表大会以来的四年中，殖民地和半殖民地国家工人的生活和工作条件已经恶化了，其中有些国家的实际工资几乎比战前水平降低了一半，千百万男女半失业或全失业，许多国家里还存在着各种形式的强迫劳动，工人的工资很低，居住条件非常恶劣。所有殖民地区都实行种族歧视，这反映在工人的工资、社会地位和政治权利上。殖民地和半殖民地国家工人生活情况悲惨的主要原因就是帝国主义的掠夺政策。
    维佳佳萨斯特拉指出：外国垄断资本阻碍殖民地和半殖民地国家工业和农业的发展，并在使那些国家的劳动人民陷于贫困的基础上谋取巨额利润。帝国主义者为了要维持他们在殖民地和半殖民地国家的经济霸权，不惜采取最残酷的办法，包括侵略战争。他们也使用种族歧视和文化毒害办法。但是，这些办法反而激起了日益强烈的民族情绪，这种情绪在强大的民族解放运动中体现出来。维佳佳萨斯特拉指出：中国人民的伟大胜利动摇了帝国主义对东方的控制，而朝鲜人民在中国人民和其他爱好和平人民的支持下所取得的胜利，说明帝国主义再也不能恢复他们从前的地位。殖民地与半殖民地国家的民族解放运动的迅速发展，是战后国际局势中促使整个殖民制度瓦解的主要因素之一，另一个使殖民制度危机加深的因素是各帝国主义国家为了争取殖民地的经济和政治霸权进行的斗争。
    维佳佳萨斯特拉指出：在第二次世界大战以后，殖民地和半殖民地国家的工会运动有很大进展，世界工联的成立对这些国家的工会运动的发展有很大影响。他说：虽然由于帝国主义者与他们的代理人进行的镇压与分裂活动，殖民地和半殖民地国家的工会运动遭到严重的困难，但是工会运动还是在迅速成长，工人们在斗争中越来越多地采取了一致行动。
    维佳佳萨斯特拉然后详尽谈到殖民地与半殖民地国家工会的任务。他说，最重要的任务是组织保卫并争取社会与经济福利的经常斗争。各国的工会组织必须审慎研究工人的经济和社会要求，以便拟定切实可行的计划。要实行这些计划，十分重要的是取得其他阶层人民、尤其是农民、手工业者和小商人对工人的斗争的支持。殖民地和半殖民地国家的工会组织对于工人取得其他阶层人民支持的问题已经有过许多经验。在某些情况下，它们甚至成立了一个统一战线来领导争取实现共同要求的斗争。对于殖民地和半殖民地国家工人十分重要的另外一个问题是保卫工会权利，并且在工会权利尚未得到承认的地方争取工会权利。
    维佳佳萨斯特拉强调提出工人行动一致和劳动人民国际团结的重要性，他接着说：
    在回顾工人阶级近几年来的行动当中，可以看出这样一个重要事实：工人争取满足他们的经济和社会要求的斗争已紧密地与民族解放运动及和平运动连系在一起了。而民族解放运动与和平运动又反过来促进了殖民地和半殖民地国家工会运动的发展和巩固。
    殖民地和半殖民地国家的工会运动正面临着一个重要的任务——与一切工人建立最密切的关系，而不论他们的政治见解、所属工会，以及他们的种族和宗教信仰如何。维佳佳萨斯特拉指出：殖民地和附属国工会运动应吸收广泛的工人群众加入争取和平的国际运动，反对帝国主义对越南和马来亚的侵略战争、反对帝国主义建立军事基地；工会必须支持农民争取改善生活条件要求土地改革的斗争，帮助他们组织起来，以各种方法向他们解释工人和农民互相支援的重要性。工人和农民的团结是民族解放运动中最强大的力量。
    他说，在争取经济独立，反对垄断资本的统治，支持发展国际贸易、民族工业和在平等的基础上进行国际经济合作的斗争中，工会应该起积极的作用。工会应该组织广大的工人群众，把他们团结在伟大的爱国运动中，使他们在包含各阶层人民的民族统一战线上起领导作用。他最后说：必须加强殖民地和半殖民地国家工会运动与宗主国工会运动之间的连系，建立殖民地和半殖民地国家工人之间的连系，并保证他们行动的一致；加强与苏联、中国和人民民主国家的工人和工会组织之间的连系。
