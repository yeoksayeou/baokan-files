Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 17th: According to TASS, Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Vyshinsky, sent a letter to the President of the Security Council on October 12th, requesting the Security Council to meet and discuss the issue of appointing a Governor for the Free Territory of Trieste. The Security Council met on the 15th and unanimously approved adding this issue to the agenda.

Vyshinsky's letter included a Soviet proposal on the Trieste issue. The proposal pointed out that the provisions of the Treaty of Peace with Italy regarding the Free Territory of Trieste have not been implemented to date. At the same time, the provisions of the treaty have been violated, and the Trieste area has been turned into an illegal foreign army and naval base. The split situation of the Free Territory of Trieste caused by the United States and British governments' violation of the treaty will cause greater international friction and threaten peace and security in Europe. The proposal stipulates that Colonel Fluckiger be appointed as Governor of the Free Territory of Trieste, that the provisions on the provisional regime of the Free Territory of Trieste be implemented immediately, that a Provisional Government Committee for the area be established, and that the permanent statute of the Free Territory of Trieste be implemented within three months of the appointment of the Governor.

During the Security Council's discussion on adding the Soviet proposal to the agenda on the 15th, U.S. Representative Lodge insisted that the unilateral decision by the United States and Britain to hand over Zone "A" of the Free Territory of Trieste to Italy was to stabilize the situation in this region of Europe. Lodge stated that he did not object to adding this issue to the Security Council agenda.

Soviet Representative Vyshinsky spoke and refuted Lodge's lies. He pointed out that the recent decision by the United States and Britain on Trieste was by no means in the interests of peace in this region of Europe. The events currently taking place in Yugoslavia prove that the decisions of the United States and Britain have in fact further increased political tension and threatened peace and security in the region. Vyshinsky said that the United States had violated one of the fundamental principles of international law – "treaties must be observed" – and the United States had abandoned the treaties it and other countries had signed. The Soviet Union wanted to uphold the inviolability of treaties.

The next Security Council meeting will be held on the 20th.

Xinhua News Agency, October 16th: On October 8th, the U.S. and British governments, in violation of the Treaty of Peace with Italy, unilaterally announced their decision to transfer the administrative authority of Zone "A" of the Free Territory of Trieste to the Italian government. As pointed out in the Soviet government's note to the U.S. and British governments on the 12th, this has increased discord among the countries neighboring the area and created a threat to peace in the region.

Following the U.S. and British unilateral decision, Tito made successive speeches, announcing that he would not recognize the U.S. and British decision, and ordered troops equipped with U.S.-supplied artillery and tanks to advance into Zone "B", while warships concentrated in the waters of Zone "B". He threatened that if Italian troops entered Zone "A", Yugoslavia was prepared to respond with "force." He demanded that only the city of Trieste be returned to Italy, while all other areas surrounding the city should be ruled by Yugoslavia. He threatened that if this plan was ignored, then "there will be no peace in this part of Europe."

In Belgrade, demonstrations were incited, with demonstrators breaking into the press offices of the U.S. and British, beating press office staff, and burning the press office's daily news bulletins.

In Rome, according to Reuters, Italian "authoritative sources" considered Tito's plan "completely unacceptable" and said that Tito's actions had "created a serious situation."

On the 11th, several U.S. warships entered the port of Trieste.

Tito continued to concentrate troops towards the border while suggesting a four-nation conference of the U.S., Britain, Yugoslavia, and Italy to resolve the issue. However, the Italian Foreign Ministry immediately issued a statement saying that if Zone "A" was not handed over to Italy, the four-nation conference was destined to fail. On the 14th, Italian Prime Minister Pella announced his agreement to a five-nation conference – adding France – but on the condition that Zone "A" be handed over to Italy or that Yugoslavia completely withdraw its troops from Zone "B".

France was not even notified in advance of the U.S. and British decision, and Paris was greatly dissatisfied with this.

Trieste is located on the northern coast of the Adriatic Sea and is an important port in the Danube River basin. The Treaty of Peace with Italy stipulated that the port and its surrounding area be designated as a free zone and divided into Zones "A" and "B", with Zone "A" occupied by the U.S. and Britain, and Zone "B" occupied by Yugoslavia.

The U.S. and British governments have repeatedly used the demands of Italy and Yugoslavia for sovereignty over Trieste to manipulate the two countries' policies to conform to their strategic goal of establishing a military aggression bloc in the Mediterranean region.

On the eve of the 1948 Italian elections, the United States, in order to support the victory of the Italian reactionaries in the elections, announced that it would hand over the Free Territory of Trieste to Italy. The U.S. and Britain's announcement of this new decision comes at a time when the Italian government is striving to get parliament to approve the so-called "European Defense Community" policy. An Associated Press report, citing opinions from diplomatic circles in Rome, pointed out that one of the purposes of the U.S. and British decision was to exchange it for Italy's ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty.

    苏联关于的里雅斯特问题提案列入安理会议程
    维辛斯基谴责美英两国制造政治紧张局势
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约消息：苏联驻联合国常任代表维辛斯基十月十二日送交安全理事会主席一封信，要求安理会开会讨论任命的里雅斯特自由区总督问题。安理会在十五日开会，一致通过将这一问题列入议程。
    维辛斯基的信中附了一个苏联提出的关于的里雅斯特问题的提案。提案指出：对意和约关于的里雅斯特自由区的条款迄今尚未执行，同时已经有人违反和约的规定，把的里雅斯特地区变成了非法的外国陆军和海军基地。美、英两国政府违反和约所造成的的里雅斯特自由区的分裂局面会引起更大的国际摩擦，并威胁着欧洲的和平与安全。提案规定，任命福律基格上校为的里雅斯特自由区总督，立即执行关于的里雅斯特自由区临时政权的条款，成立该区临时政府委员会，在任命总督后三个月内把的里雅斯特自由区永久法规付诸实施。
    在十五日安理会讨论将苏联提案列入议程问题时，美国代表洛奇硬说，美、英二国宣布把的里雅斯特自由区“甲”区交给意大利的片面决定是为了使欧洲这一地区的局势能稳定下来。洛奇表示不反对把这一问题列入安理会议程。
    苏联代表维辛斯基发言驳斥了洛奇的谎话。他指出，美、英二国最近对的里雅斯特的决定完全不是为了欧洲这一地区的和平的利益。目前在南斯拉夫发生的事件证明，美、英二国的决定事实上已进一步使政治局势趋于紧张，使该地区的和平与安全受到威胁。维辛斯基说，美国违反了国际法的根本原则之一——“条约必须履行”，美国抛弃了美国和其他国家签订的条约。苏联正是要维护条约不受破坏。
    安理会下一次会议将在二十日举行。
    【新华社十六日讯】十月八日，美、英政府违反对意和约，迳自宣布决定把的里雅斯特自由区
    “甲”区的管理权移交给意大利政府，正如十二日苏联政府致美、英政府的照会中所指出的，这已增加了该区邻近国家之间的不和，造成了对该地区和平的威胁。
    美、英的片面决定宣布后，铁托就接连发表演说，宣布不承认英、美的决定，同时命令携带美国供应的大炮、坦克的军队开进“乙”区，军舰也集中到“乙”区海面。他威胁说，意大利军队若开进
    “甲”区，南斯拉夫准备以“武力”对付。他要求只把的里雅斯特城归意大利，而把包围该城的其他全部地区统统归南斯拉夫统治。他恫吓说：如果这计划被漠视，那么“这一部分欧洲地区将没有和平”。
    在贝尔格莱德，煽起了示威，示威者闯进美、英两国的新闻处，殴打了新闻处职员并烧毁新闻处的每日新闻公报。
    在罗马，据路透社消息，意大利的“权威人士”认为铁托的计划“完全不能接受”，并说铁托的举动已“造成了一个严重的局面”。
    十一日，几艘美国军舰开进了的里雅斯特港。
    铁托一方面继续把军队向边境集中，同时建议召开美、英、南、意四国会议解决。但意大利外交部随即发表声明说，如果“甲”区不交给意大利，四国会议注定要失败。十四日，意大利总理贝拉宣布同意召开五国会议——加上法国——，但须把“甲”区交给意大利或南斯拉夫把军队完全撤出“乙”区为条件。
    法国在美英这次决定中事先甚至未曾接到通知，巴黎方面对此大为不满。
    的里雅斯特位于亚得里亚海北岸，是多瑙河流域重要港口。对意和约曾规定将该港及其附近地区划为自由区，并规定将该区划为“甲”“乙”两区，“甲”区由英、美占领，“乙”区由南斯拉夫占领。
    美、英政府几次三番利用意大利、南斯拉夫对的里雅斯特主权的要求操纵其间，以影响两国的政策，使之符合于它们建立地中海区军事侵略集团的战略目的。
    一九四八年意大利选举前夕，美国为了支持意大利反动派在选举中获胜，宣布要把的里雅斯特自由区交给意大利。这次美英宣布新决定，正是在意大利政府努力要让议会批准所谓“欧洲防务集团”政策的时候。美联社的一则消息引罗马外交界人士的意见指出，美英这一决定的目的之一，就是为了换取意大利对“欧洲防务集团”条约的批准。
