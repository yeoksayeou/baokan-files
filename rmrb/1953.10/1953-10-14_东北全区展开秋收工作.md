Autumn harvest work is unfolding throughout Northeast China.

Currently, early-maturing crops have been basically harvested, and the harvesting of late-maturing crops is also vigorously underway. In southern Liaoxi Province, millet has been completely cut in Suizhong, Yi County, and other areas, and more than 20 percent of sorghum has been harvested; in mountainous areas, most of the sorghum has been harvested. In Jilin Province, the harvesting of millet, soybeans, sorghum, and other crops has begun in Jiutai, Yongji, Panshi, and other areas. The autumn harvest work in Liaodong and Rehe Provinces is also progressing rapidly. In Rehe Province, most of the millet has been harvested, and more than half of the sorghum has been harvested. Harvesting has also generally begun in Heilongjiang and Songjiang Provinces, where the climate is colder and the harvest is later each year.

This year, Northeast China has experienced many natural disasters. Thanks to the leadership of Party committees and people's governments at all levels, who led the peasants in resolutely fighting against natural disasters, most areas have preserved more than 70 percent of their normal yield, with the exception of a few severely affected areas, and some areas have achieved bumper harvests. In Rehe Province, the average yield of more than 1.5 million hectares of sorghum, millet, soybeans, rice, corn, broomcorn millet, peanuts, potatoes, and other crops is 80 percent of normal, an increase of more than 10 percent compared to last year. Under the leadership of the Party and the people's government, the broad masses of peasants in Heilongjiang Province, after overcoming natural disasters such as spring drought and summer floods, launched an autumn protection campaign. Leading cadres in Qinggang, Yian, Suiling, Nehe, and other counties, based on weather forecasts, actively organized peasants to prevent early frost damage and protect crops, with good results. After overcoming spring drought and summer floods, the peasants in Baicheng County have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. According to current surveys, the actual harvest of the county can reach 880,660 shi, exceeding the normal yield by 52.1 percent and exceeding this year's planned yield by 7.8 percent. The peasants all said: This is the best year for crops in Baicheng County in decades.

    东北全区展开秋收工作
    东北全区普遍展开秋收工作。
    目前，各地早熟庄稼已基本割完，晚熟作物的收割工作也在大力进行：辽西省南部的绥中、义县等地的谷子全部割倒，高粱割完百分之二十以上，靠山地区的高粱大部割完。吉林省的九台、永吉、磐石等地开始收割谷子、大豆、高粱等庄稼。辽东、热河两省的秋收工作进行得也很迅速，热河省的谷子大部已经割完，高粱也割完了一半多。气候较冷、每年收割较晚的黑龙江、松江两省的收割也普遍开始。
    今年，东北地区的自然灾害较多，由于各级党委和人民政府领导各地农民坚决向自然灾害进行斗争，除少数地区受灾较重外，大部地区都保住了七成以上的年景，并有部分地区获得了丰收。热河全省一百五十多万垧高粱、谷子、大豆、水稻、玉米、糜子、落花生、马铃薯等农作物平均有八成年景，比去年增产一成以上。黑龙江省广大农民在党和人民政府的领导下，战胜了春旱、夏涝等等自然灾害后，又展开了护秋斗争。青岗、依安、绥棱、讷河等县领导方面，根据气象预报，积极组织农民预防早霜为害，保护庄稼，收到良好效果。该省白城县农民在战胜春旱夏涝之后，已获得了空前的丰收，据目前调查，全县实际收获量可达八十八万零六百六十石，超过常年产量百分之五十二点一，超过今年计划产量百分之七点八。农民都说：这是白城县好几十年来庄稼长得最好的一年。
