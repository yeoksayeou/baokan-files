    Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Plant Before Completion

    After the autumn wind drove away the smoke and clouds over Anshan, the magnificent factory buildings of China's first modern seamless steel tube plant, which was newly built, appeared particularly clear and beautiful. The tall scaffolding around the factory buildings has been removed. The rows of skylight glass and the black new paint on the roof of the factory building reflect thousands of dazzling rays of light under the sun. The deafening noise of riveting metal and the roar of cranes not long ago, all the sounds of this construction site, have now been replaced by a sound of mechanical operation. Several large gray-white chimneys pointing to the sky, one of which is already smoking, production personnel are beginning to test-fire the heating steam boiler.

    Some visiting people can no longer find many of the labor models they are familiar with on this construction site, because they have all been transferred to new jobs successively due to the successful completion of their work. In that spacious gray office building, except for the personnel responsible for the finishing touches and handover, who still occupy a small office, the other offices are completely occupied by production personnel. These personnel responsible for the finishing touches are completing the final work nervously and happily in accordance with the "Scattered Project Construction Schedule" in the construction site director's office. On October 16, the construction site director convened a meeting of the cadres he led and re-arranged the progress of the last few finishing projects. After the meeting, someone suggested to him: When we came, this was still a desolate place, and now we have nurtured it into a beautiful girl. You should write a book about the construction of the first seamless steel tube plant in New China, just like the chairman of the first collective farm in the Soviet Union who built socialism, to celebrate its transfer to production. In the past, where slogans such as "A Century of Great Plans, Quality First" and "Guarantee Quality, Strive for Early Completion of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant" were posted, they have now been replaced by huge red slogans such as "Conscientiously Study Advanced Soviet Production Experience and Ensure Safe Production!" and "Highly Automated and Mechanized Factories Require a High Degree of Labor Discipline!"

    The large factory building has been cleaned very neatly by more than two hundred workers. The scene of the staff welcoming the completion is exciting and encouraging. The cranes like large iron bridges are already majestically traversing the upper part of the factory building, and they are constantly unloading steel materials from the trains parked inside the factory building. In rows of blue steel material racks, many tube blanks of various steel qualities and thicknesses have been unloaded. Three train cars of dry oak wood, which have strong combustion power and are used to bake the heating furnace, have also been transported into the factory. In the tool warehouse, workers are also busy unboxing, classifying, and wiping various production tools. Various specifications of machine parts needed for mechanical equipment have long been wiped and polished by the workers and placed next to the machines that are being test-run. Next to the installed and accepted machines, bright red production record boards have been set up. The staff who operate the tube blank shearing machine, centering machine, and charging machine were praised by the leaders and technicians of the seamless steel tube plant on the first day of trial tube blank shearing, centering, and charging: "The first trial operation was so good, after a few more days of practice, it will be very skilled when the hot test rolling starts." The production personnel of the entire factory are actively carrying out technical learning for hot test rolling. Preparations for baking the heating furnace are also being stepped up. The heating workers have completed the operating procedures and safety regulations for baking the furnace, and their test scores are very good. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company Gas Plant and the Central Rescue Station have respectively lectured the heating workers on the properties and use of gas and methods to prevent accidents; the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Power Department, Technical Security Department, and the Seamless Steel Tube Plant have jointly held a meeting to clarify the responsibilities of the furnace baking work and exchanged operating procedures.

### 竣工前的鞍钢无缝钢管厂

    竣工前的鞍钢无缝钢管厂
    秋风驱走了鞍山上空的烟云后，这座新建的我国第一座近代化无缝钢管厂巍峨的厂房，显得格外清晰和美丽。厂房周围高大的建筑架已经拆除。厂房上一排排的天窗玻璃和房面上的黑色新油漆，在阳光下反射出万道耀眼的光芒。不久前铆接金属的震耳的噪音，起重机的轰鸣，这一切建筑工地的音响，现在已为一片机械运转声所代替。高指苍空的几个灰白色的大烟囱，有一个已经在冒烟了，生产人员在开始试烧暖汽锅炉。
    有些前来访问的人们，已经找不到他们所熟悉的这个工地上的许多劳动模范了，他们都因工作胜利结束而陆续转移到新的工作岗位。在那宽敞的灰色办公楼房里，除去负责收尾工程和交工的人员还占着一间面积很小的办公室外，在其他办公室里的已经完全是生产人员。这些负责收尾工程的人员正按照工地主任办公室里的“零星工程施工进度表”，紧张而愉快地完成最后的工作。十月十六，工地主任召集他所领导的干部举行了会议，重新排定了最后几项收尾工程的进度。会后有人就向他建议说：我们来时这里还是一片荒凉，现在我们已把它抚育成了一个漂亮的姑娘了，你应该像苏联建设社会主义第一个集体农庄的农庄主席那样，写一本新中国建设第一个无缝钢管厂的书，来庆祝她的移交生产。从前，这里张贴着“百年大计，质量第一。”“保证质量，争取无缝钢管厂提前竣工。”等标语的地方，现在已改换上了“认真学习苏联先进生产经验，保证安全生产！”“高度自动化机械化的工厂，要求高度的劳动纪律！”等红色的巨幅标语。
    宽大的厂房里面，已被二百多个工人清扫得很干净利落。职工们迎接竣工的情景，令人兴奋鼓舞。像大铁桥一样的吊车已经威风凛凛地横行在厂房的上部，它不时地从停放在厂房内的火车上卸运着钢料。在一排排蓝色钢制的料架子里，已经卸进了各种钢质和粗细不同的许多管胚。用来烘加热炉的有着强烈燃烧力的三火车干柞木，也已经运进工厂。在工具仓库里，工人们也正忙碌着各种生产工具的启箱、归类和擦洗工作。机械设备所需用的各种规格的机件备品，早被工人们擦洗得晶莹发光后，安放在正在试车的机器旁边。安装好了经过验收的机器旁边，已经摆设出了鲜红的生产纪录板。操纵管胚剪断机、定心机、装炉机的职工们，在试行管胚剪断、定心、装料等工作的第一天，就得到了无缝钢管厂领导干部和技术人员的赞扬：“第一次试行操作就干得这样好，再演习几天，到热试轧时就会很熟练了。”全厂的生产人员们正在积极地进行热试轧的技术学习。烘加热炉的准备工作也正在加紧进行。加热工人已学完烘炉的操作规程和保安规程，考试成绩都很好。鞍山钢铁公司燃气厂、中央救护站已分别向加热工人讲授了瓦斯性能、瓦斯使用和预防发生事故的方法；鞍山钢铁公司动力处、技术保安处和无缝钢管厂等单位已联合举行会议，明确划分烘炉工作的职责，交换了操作规程。    （新华社）
