Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 30th - Twenty-seven days after Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner Zhang Zilong was murdered by special agents in a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) custodial compound, the NNSC is preparing to conduct a site investigation into the case today. The NNSC notified our side at 9:30 this morning to provide witnesses for this case. Our side responded this afternoon, stating that it will provide witnesses at any time starting tomorrow to assist in the investigation.

In order to ensure the smooth progress of the investigation, our side submitted specific recommendations to the NNSC yesterday morning at 3:00 AM regarding the arrangements for the investigation. The Korean and Chinese side pointed out that if the NNSC wants to conduct a serious investigation, it must take the following effective measures to break the control of the special agents: (1) First, arrest the main special agents in the compound where the incident occurred, that is, the masterminds of the case; (2) Evacuate the prisoners of war from the compound where the incident occurred, so that the investigation can proceed without any interference, and allow the witnesses to enter the compound to point out the location where the corpse is buried, and precisely ascertain the evidence of the crime; (3) Bring the prisoners of war out one by one for the witnesses to identify the murderers, and once the murderers are identified, they should be immediately arrested and tried. The Korean and Chinese side also pointed out that since the Korean and Chinese side is the party to which the victim belongs, the Korean and Chinese side has the right to send representatives and witnesses to participate in the investigation. However, this opinion of the Korean and Chinese side has not yet been accepted by the NNSC. Facts will prove that if the investigation cannot be carried out under the above conditions, the investigation will not be able to proceed smoothly.

Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner Zhang Zilong was killed on October 3rd in the No. 28 compound of the NNSC custodial area, with his abdomen cut open and his heart removed by Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents. As early as October 4th and 7th, Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners You Xuehe and Huang Lichao, who had been repatriated, successively exposed the case to NNSC personnel (including, on one occasion, Indian Custodial Forces Commander Major General Thorat) in Panmunjom. However, the NNSC and the Indian Custodial Forces did not immediately begin an investigation and arrest the murderers. Even after our side requested the NNSC to investigate this case on October 23rd, the NNSC did not conduct a prompt investigation.

Because the NNSC failed to conduct an immediate investigation, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents have had ample time to make arrangements and destroy evidence. According to repatriated prisoners of war from our side, the body of the murdered prisoner of war may have been secretly transported away by U.S. special agents driving garbage trucks. This is a common method used by Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents to eliminate evidence after murdering prisoners of war in the Koje-do and Jeju-do prisoner of war camps. At the same time, since special agents can move freely in various compounds, the main culprits and accomplices in the murder may have already been hidden.

If the NNSC cannot accept the opinions of the Korean and Chinese side, follow past mistakes, and rely on special agents to conduct the investigation, then this investigation will not only be fruitless, but will also be used by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents to whitewash the crime of murdering prisoners of war, and take the opportunity to attack NNSC personnel and personnel from the Korean and Chinese side. According to a report by the Associated Press on the 30th, well-informed U.S. sources revealed that Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents mixed in the NNSC custodial compounds, under the instruction of the U.S. side, will conduct "violent demonstrations" and attack Polish and Czechoslovakian committee members participating in the investigation, as well as witnesses in this case.

    中立国遣返委员会准备调查张子龙被害案
    我方认为应打破特务控制并严防消灭罪证
    【新华社开城三十日电】中国人民志愿军被俘人员张子龙在中立国看管营场内被特务分子谋杀二十七天以后，中立国遣返委员会才准备在今天对这一案件进行现场调查。中立国遣返委员会在今晨九时半通知我方提供这一案件的人证，我方已在今天下午提出答复，将从明天起随时提供人证，协助调查的进行。
    我方为了使调查工作得以顺利进行。在昨天早晨三时向中立国遣返委员会提出了进行调查的具体安排的意见。朝中方面指出，中立国遣返委员会如果要进行认真调查，就必须采取下列有效措施打破特务分子的控制：（一）首先逮捕发生事件的营场中的主要特务分子，即案件的主谋者；（二）撤清发生事件的营场中的战俘，才能使调查不受任何干扰地进行，并使作证者能进入营场指出埋葬尸首的地点，精密地查明案件的罪证；（三）将战俘逐一带出，由作证者辨认凶手，一经指出凶手，应立即加以逮捕并进行审判。朝中方面同时指出：由于朝中方面为受难者所属一方，朝中方面有权派出代表和作证者一起参加调查。但是，朝中方面的这个意见，迄今仍未被中立国遣返委员会所接受。事实将证明：如果调查不能在上述条件下进行，则调查工作便不可能顺利地进行。
    中国人民志愿军被俘人员张子龙是在十月三日，在中立国看管营地第二十八号营场内被蒋匪特务剖腹挖心而死的。早在十月四日和七日，遣返归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员尤学和、黄立超先后在板门店向中立国遣返委员会人员（其中有一次，印度看管部队司令托拉特少将也在场）揭发了这个案件。但是，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队并未立即着手进行调查，并逮捕杀人凶犯。甚至在十月二十三日我方要求中立国遣返委员会调查这一案件以后，中立国遣返委员会也没有迅速进行调查。
    由于中立国遣返委员会未能立即进行调查，蒋匪特务已有充分时间来进行布置，消灭罪证。据遣返归来的我方被俘人员说：被杀害的战俘的尸体完全可能已被驾驶垃圾车的美方特务秘密运走。这是蒋李特务在巨济岛、济州岛战俘营中谋杀战俘以后常常采取的消灭罪证的方法。同时，由于特务分子可以在各个营场里自由来往，因此杀人主犯及帮凶完全可能已经藏匿起来。
    如果中立国遣返委员会不能接受朝中方面的意见，因袭过去的错误，依靠特务分子进行调查，则这次调查不仅会毫无结果，且将被蒋匪特务利用来洗拭谋杀战俘的罪行，并且乘机袭击中立国人员和朝中方面人员。据合众社三十日报道，美方的消息灵通人士透露：混在中立国看管营场内的蒋匪特务在美方授意之下，将进行“狂暴的示威”，袭击参加调查的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员，以及这一案件的证人。
