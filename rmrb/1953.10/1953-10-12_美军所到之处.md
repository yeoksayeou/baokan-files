    Where US Troops Go
    Tanks Crush Farmland
    In July this year, the U.S. Army held a military exercise in the Neumarkt and Strasswalchen areas of Austria. The U.S. troops' tanks almost flattened all the crops in the area, and the nearby vineyards and other orchards were severely damaged. At the same time, the roads in the Henndorf area were also crushed. These sinful acts of the U.S. military aroused the anger and protest of the Austrian people, and they demanded compensation. However, in August, the U.S. military held another large-scale military exercise in western Austria. Their intensified behavior has caused deeper and deeper disasters to the Austrian people.
    Increase in Illegitimate Children
    Reuters reported in September, citing a London newspaper, that two out of every five illegitimate children in Oxford are fathered by American soldiers. Their mothers are mostly unmarried girls in their teens. Since American soldiers have been stationed in Oxford, British mothers have repeatedly forbidden their daughters from going out on the streets at night, but American soldiers are still trying every means to pursue women. The number of illegitimate children in Oxford is obviously increasing month by month and year by year. According to statistics, the number in 1952 increased by 60% compared to 1951. Despite the displeasure of the citizens of Oxford, the spokesperson of the American occupation authorities believes that "this is a very common thing."
    Forcing People to Sell Their Children
    In Japan, under the iron heel of the American occupation army, the people's lives are becoming more and more difficult, and the selling of children is common everywhere. In the second half of 1951, there were 658 cases nationwide in Japan where parents sold their children; in 1952, according to a survey by the Japanese Ministry of Labor, the number of cases of selling children increased to at least 1,489 for the whole year. Among them, girls who were sold accounted for 89% of the total, and most of them were around 17 years old. A boy was sold for only one and a half U.S. dollars, and girls were more expensive, most of them being forced into prostitution.
    The tragic experiences brought to the Japanese people by the American invaders are not limited to this. In addition to the 311 million tsubo (one tsubo equals 3.3058 square meters) of Japanese people's land that has already been occupied by the U.S. military as military bases, the Yoshida government is also preparing to allocate another 190,000 acres of fertile land to the American occupation army. These Japanese people who have lost their land have no way to live except to sell their children. (Attached picture)

    美军所到之处
    坦克压毁了农田
    今年七月间，美国陆军在奥地利纽马希特和斯特拉斯瓦尔特地区举行了一次军事演习，美军的坦克几乎把这地区的全部庄稼都碾平了，附近的葡萄园和其他果树园遭到了严重的摧残，同时，亨多夫地区的公路也被压毁了。美军的这种罪恶行为，激起了奥地利人民的怒愤和抗议，并纷纷要求赔偿。可是，八月间美军又在奥地利西部举行大规模的军事演习。他们这种变本加厉的行为，给奥地利人民造成的灾难是越来越深重了。
    私生子增多
    英国的路透社报道今年九月份伦敦一家报纸的消息说：牛津城每五个私生子中，有两个私生子的父亲是美国兵。他们的母亲，大都是十几岁未结婚的女孩子。自从美国兵驻在牛津以后，英国母亲们虽然一再禁止自己的女儿晚上到大街上去，但美国兵仍在千方百计地追逐女人，牛津城的私生子显然在逐月逐年增加。据统计，一九五二年便较一九五一年增多百分之六十。尽管牛津市民多么不高兴，但美国驻军当局的发言人却认为“这是很普通的事”。
    逼得人民卖儿卖女
    在美国占领军铁蹄践踏下的日本，人民的生活越来越困难了，卖儿女的事到处可见。一九五一年下半年，日本全国有六百五十八起父母卖掉了自己的儿女；到一九五二年，据日本劳动省的调查，卖儿卖女的事全年至少增加到一千四百八十九起。其中被卖出的女孩子占总数的百分之八十九，他（她）们大多数在十七岁左右。一个男孩子只卖到一块半美元，女孩子价钱要高些，她们多数被逼作娼妓。
    美国侵略者给日本人民带来的悲惨的遭遇，还不止此。日本人民的田地除已有三亿一千一百万坪（每坪合三·三○五八平方公尺）被美军霸占为军事基地以外，吉田政府还准备再将十九万英亩良田划给美国占领军。这些失掉田地的日本人民，除了卖儿卖女以外，就一天也没法生活下去了。（附图片）
