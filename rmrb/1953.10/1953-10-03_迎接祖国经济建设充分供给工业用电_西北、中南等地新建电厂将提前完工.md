To welcome national economic construction and fully supply the power needed for industrial development, the Ministry of Fuel Industry has expanded and built new types of power plants in the Northwest, Central South, and other regions. In addition to the large-scale automated generator in the Central South region, which officially began operation on July 1 this year, another new type of power plant in the Northwest has been put into production on the eve of the great National Day of the motherland. In addition, several new power plants in the Central South and Northwest regions will also be installed and completed ahead of schedule in October this year. The power generation capacity of these new power plants is 2.44 times greater than the original equipment capacity of the power industry in these areas. In particular, in the fraternal ethnic minority areas of the Northwest frontier, where there are broad prospects for the development of both light and heavy industries, the new plants have a capacity more than 18 times greater than the original power industry equipment capacity.

The construction of these new power plants, from data collection to design, construction, and even trial operation after installation, has been carried out under the direct leadership of Soviet experts. With the selfless labor of all employees and the help of Soviet experts, and due to the continuous improvement of operational technology and management levels, the tasks have been completed ahead of schedule. Among them, the construction of a new plant in the Northwest completed the installation of a boiler, a generator, and other auxiliary equipment by the end of August, ahead of schedule. After trial operation, the situation was good, and it was decided to officially generate electricity on September 30. The main equipment of these new power plants is fully automated. For example, the boiler that has been installed in the Northwest is equipped with a special coal transportation system. After the coal is unloaded from the train, it can be automatically ground into powder and loaded into the boiler through a special equipment. Also, the duty officer in the main control room of the electrical workshop can fully understand and control the power supply work of the entire plant while sitting in front of the distribution panel. The distribution panel is equipped with automatic signals. If there is any problem, the automatic signal will immediately notify the duty officer for maintenance.

The early completion of the construction of these new power plants is also inseparable from the direct leadership and strong support of the local party and government leading organs. For example, in the new plant in the Central South region, due to the insufficient understanding of the arduousness and complexity of capital construction by the power industry leaders, a considerable confusion was formed in the management work, and there was also a phenomenon of inverting priorities or failing to distinguish between urgency in the preparation of materials and other preparations. The local party committee and the people's government transferred many capable cadres to participate in the management work and helped establish various specialized responsibility systems, strengthening planning management. This reversed the past confusion and enabled the plant's construction to achieve great success in terms of progress and quality. Therefore, the construction project of this new plant has been basically completed and can be officially operated in October. (Zhong Ran)

Twenty-five state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories in Xi'an City have overfulfilled or completed the national production plan for September ahead of schedule as a gift to the first National Day after the start of the country's Five-Year Plan. After the launch of the competition at the Xi'an People's Flour Mill, the hourly output increased from about 400 bags in the past to 480 bags, creating the highest record in the Northwest region; the flour extraction rate also increased by 16%; some accidents occurred every week in the past, but now they have been basically eliminated. Workshop 5 of Factory 601 created a new record of an average daily output of 8.7 sets of cotton clothing per person, with a quality reaching 100%. Since the Xi'an Paint Factory started construction in July this year, it has never completed the daily and monthly plans. However, after the launch of the competition in mid-September, the average daily overcompletion was 28% higher than planned, and the quality has also been greatly improved. It is estimated that by the end of the year, not only can the unfinished tasks of July and August be made up, but also overproduction can be achieved.

In the process of completing the September production plan, various industrial and mining enterprises formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy, as well as various indicators such as output, quality, and cost, and submitted them to the workers for in-depth discussion. Many factories also compiled and revised operating plans and established a series of responsibility systems. Therefore, the Northwest Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant overcame the phenomenon of production imbalance and work stoppage due to lack of materials that began in September. Although the Northwest Mining Machinery Repair Plant temporarily received the task of manufacturing ten drilling rigs, it did not disrupt the original work plan and steps, and completed the temporarily received task as scheduled. In the competition, the vast majority of factories improved their leadership methods, further relying on the masses of workers, grasping key points, tapping potential, adopting rationalization proposals, and promoting advanced experience. Workers at Factory 603 put forward 413 rationalization proposals focusing on key issues, of which 322 were adopted. The punch press team in Workshop 1 of the factory used steel wire instead of iron plates for making cotton-padded shoes, reducing costs and improving quality, which can save the country 200 million yuan in the next three months. Workers in the mechanic workshop of the Northwest Agricultural Machinery Plant put forward nine proposals, which increased the value of products by more than 30 million yuan in one month. After further implementing the parallel assembly line operation method at Factory 604, the product turnover period was shortened from 30 days to 16 days; due to the reduction of the backlog of semi-finished products, the turnover of working capital was accelerated, so that the factory could free up 600 million yuan of funds to be turned over to the national treasury.

    迎接祖国经济建设充分供给工业用电
    西北、中南等地新建电厂将提前完工
    西安许多工厂提前完成了九月份国家生产计划
    为迎接祖国经济建设，充分供给工业发展所需要的动力，中央燃料工业部在西北、中南等区扩建和新建了新型电厂。除中南区大型自动化发电机已在今年七月一日正式参加运转外，在祖国伟大的国庆前夕，西北又有一座新建的新型电厂投入生产。此外，中南、西北两区还有几座新电厂也将提前于今年十月内安装完成。这些新电厂的发电能力比各该地电业原有的设备容量共大二点四四倍。特别是西北边疆兄弟民族地区，由于那里轻重工业都有大量发展的前途，那里的新厂比原有电业设备容量要大到十八倍以上。
    这些新电厂的建设，从搜集资料到设计、施工，以至安装完成后的试运转，都是在苏联专家直接领导下进行的。在全体职工忘我的劳动和苏联专家帮助下，由于操作技术和管理水平的不断提高，都能提前完成任务。其中西北一个新厂建设已提前于八月底完成了一部锅炉和一部发电机及其他附属设备的安装工作，经过试运转，情况良好，决定在九月三十日正式发电。这些新电厂的主要装备都完全是自动化的。例如西北已安装完成的锅炉，就装有专门的运煤系统，煤从火车卸下后，经过一种特制设备，可以自动磨成粉末装进锅炉。还有电气车间主控制室值班员，坐在配电盘前，就可以完全了解和控制全厂的供电工作。在配电盘上都装置着自动信号，假如那里万一出了毛病，自动信号就立即通知值班员，以便进行检修。
    这些新电厂建设的所以能够提前完成，又是和当地党政领导机关的直接领导和大力支持分不开的。如中南区新厂由于电业领导上对基本建设的艰巨性与复杂性认识不够，在管理工作上形成相当混乱的局面，对于材料准备和其他准备工作也有轻重倒置或者缓急不分的现象。地方党委和人民政府即调配了很多得力干部参加管理工作，并帮助建立了各种专责制，加强了计划管理，这就扭转了过去的混乱现象，而使该厂建设在进度上、质量上都取得了很大成绩。因之这一座新厂建设工程现已基本完成，在十月份就可正式运转了。　（锺然）
    西安市二十五个国营、地方国营和公私合营工厂，超额或提前完成了九月份国家生产计划，作为向国家五年计划开始后的第一个国庆节的献礼。西安人民面粉厂在开展竞赛两三天后，每小时产量就由过去四百袋左右提高到四百八十袋，创造了西北区的最高纪录；出粉率也提高了百分之十六；过去每周都要发生一些事故，现在已基本消灭。六零一工厂五车间创造了平均每人日产八点七套棉服的新纪录，质量达到百分之百。西安油漆厂自今年七月开工以来，没有完成过日度和月度计划，但在九月中旬开展竞赛后，平均每天较计划超额完成百分之二十八，质量也大有提高，估计到年底不但可以补齐七、八两月未完成的任务，且能达到超额生产。
    在完成九月份生产计划过程中，各工矿制订了增产节约计划和产量、质量、成本等各项指标，并交给工人进行了深入讨论。许多工厂并编制与修订了作业计划，建立了一系列责任制。因此，西北农业机械制造厂便克服了九月开始时生产不平衡和停工待料的现象，西北矿山机械修配厂虽然临时接到制造十部钻塔的任务，但并未打乱原定工作计划和步骤，且如期完成了临时接到的任务。在竞赛中，绝大部分工厂改进了领导方法，进一步依靠工人群众，抓住关键、挖掘潜力、采纳合理化建议，推广先进经验。六零三工厂工人围绕着关键问题提出了四百十三件合理化建议，被采纳的达三百二十二件。该厂一车间冲床小组作棉皮鞋以钢丝代替铁板，成本减低，质量提高，今后三个月内可为国家节约两亿元。西北农业机械厂机工车间工人提出九件建议，一个月内就增加了价值三千多万元的产品。六零四工厂在进一步推行了平行流水作业法后，产品周转期由三十天缩短到十六天；由于减少了半成品的积压而加速了流动资金的周转，因而使工厂可以腾出六亿元资金上缴国库。
