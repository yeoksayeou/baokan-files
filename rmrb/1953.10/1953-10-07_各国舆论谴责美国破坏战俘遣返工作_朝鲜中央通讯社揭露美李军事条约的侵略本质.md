Xinhua News Agency, October 6th: TASS, Moscow, October 5th: "Pravda" published an article by Makarenko entitled "Provocative Actions of the U.S. Military." The article exposed the U.S. military's conspiracy to delay explanatory work with prisoners of war.

The author wrote: After repeatedly refusing to start the explanatory work, the U.S. side openly exerted pressure on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. U.S. and Kuomintang news agencies launched a propaganda campaign to try to get the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to abandon the powers agreed to during the Panmunjom negotiations, and threatened to disrupt the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission with "force and bloodshed." The United Nations Command, i.e., the U.S. military command, protested to Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and Indian representative, against the rules for explaining to prisoners of war formulated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

The author pointed out: The intention of the U.S. conspiracies is obvious. The aim is to first delay the explanatory work with the prisoners of war, and then to sabotage it. In addition, they are planning to take all means to create incidents in the POW camps in order to undermine the entire plan stipulated in the armistice agreement.

After recounting the incidents of U.S. agents mixed into the POW camps attacking neutral personnel and creating riots, the author said: There is no doubt that creating provocative actions in the POW camps is part of the U.S. imperialists' sabotage plan, the purpose of which is to undermine the armistice. Peace-loving forces are closely watching the U.S. provocative actions in Korea. The people of the world unanimously hope to maintain peace in the Far East and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 6th: London's "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 3rd stating: "The vast majority of United Nations member states want peace in the Far East," but the United States and its servants "are trying to obstruct the implementation of the armistice agreement and preparing excuses for resuming the war."

The editorial said: "It is becoming clearer day by day that the Americans are plotting to create excuses to undermine the Korean armistice. First, they excluded India and other neutral Asian countries from the political conference, making the success of the political conference even more difficult. Now they have gone further and attacked the Indian army." "They want to force the Indian army to withdraw, so that face-to-face talks with the prisoners of war will be impossible. The U.S. government's treacherous means of dealing with the POW issue have never been used by any government."

The editorial concluded: "The British people should force their government to immediately protest the U.S.'s destructive tactics."

Xinhua News Agency, Bombay, October 6th: A dispatch from Bombay: "The Times of India" condemned the United States for obstructing and undermining the repatriation of prisoners of war. The newspaper published an editorial on the 5th entitled "Bad Faith," stating that the U.S. "approach to the entire issue of repatriating Korean prisoners of war is very unsatisfactory." The editorial said: "Judging from the remarks and attitudes of its spokesmen, so far they seem more interested in hindering the resolution of the repatriation issue. It is fair to ask the United States: Does it want peace or war? If it wants peace, then the time has come for the glib talk of U.S. spokesmen to become more reasonable, more responsible, and more convincing. If it does not want peace, then the time has also come to drop all pretenses. The conspiracy to undermine or delay the repatriation of prisoners of war by one side or the other is a complete betrayal of those who sincerely desire to end the Korean War." The editorial said: "What must be told to Hamblen and his attendants is that they would do well to keep their mouths shut."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 6th: The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 6th, exposing the aggressive nature of the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" concluded between the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique. The commentary pointed out: After the United States opposed the proposal for a reasonable composition of the political conference at the United Nations General Assembly, it formally signed the so-called "U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Syngman Rhee puppet government on October 1st. It is obvious that the political conference, which will first discuss the issue of withdrawing foreign troops from Korea, and the so-called "U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty," which attempts to keep U.S. troops stationed in South Korea for a long time, have nothing in common. However, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles still attempted to cover up the aggressive nature of this treaty with the same old logic in his speech, saying that "aggressive forces" still posed a threat to them, and that this treaty was conducive to "the collective security of the free nations of the Pacific"; and that the United States hoped that a political conference would be convened and a peace agreement would be reached.

The commentary pointed out: However, everyone knows that there are no other aggressive forces besides the U.S.-British bloc. It is the United States that has signed many aggressive military treaties and alliances with its servant states. The United States is also attempting to plot a so-called Pacific alliance with Japanese militarism as its backbone, attempting to mobilize Japanese samurai and the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs to provoke war under the vicious plan of "using Asians to fight Asians." No matter how cunning Dulles' words are, they cannot cover up the aggressive nature of the "U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty," which aims to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The commentary emphasized: The entire Korean people and all peace-loving people, together, condemn the signing of this aggressive treaty and the U.S. conspiracy to undermine the political conference. The entire Korean people are determined to continue the struggle to smash the war conspiracy of U.S. imperialism.

### 各国舆论谴责美国破坏战俘遣返工作  朝鲜中央通讯社揭露美李军事条约的侵略本质

    各国舆论谴责美国破坏战俘遣返工作
    朝鲜中央通讯社揭露美李军事条约的侵略本质
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日电：“真理报”刊载了马卡连科所作题为“美国军方的挑衅行动”的文章。文章揭露了朝鲜美军司令部拖延对战俘进行解释工作的阴谋。
    作者写道：美方在再度拒绝开始进行解释工作后又公然对中立国遣返委员会使用压力。美国和国民党的通讯社发动了一种宣传运动，企图使中立国遣返委员会放弃双方在板门店谈判期间同意付给它的权力，并扬言要用“武力和流血手段”来破坏中立国遣返委员会的工作。联合国军，即美军司令部，曾向中立国遣返委员会主席、印度代表蒂迈雅中将提出抗议，反对中立国遣返委员会拟定的对战俘进行解释工作的规则。
    作者指出：美国种种阴谋的用意是明显的。其目的在于首先拖延对战俘进行解释工作，然后再破坏它。除此之外，他们正打算采取一切手段，在战俘营中制造事件，以破坏停战协定所规定的全部计划。
    作者在历述混入战俘营中的美方特务袭击中立国人员和制造暴乱的事件后说：毫无疑问，在战俘营中制造挑衅行动，是美帝国主义者破坏活动计划中的一部分，其目的在于破坏停战。爱好和平的力量正密切地注视着美方在朝鲜的挑衅行动。全世界的人民一致希望保持远东及全世界的和平。
    【新华社柏林六日电】伦敦“工人日报”三日发表社论说：“绝大多数联合国会员国希望远东和平”，但是，美国及其仆从“正设法阻挠停战协定条款的实施，并为恢复战争准备藉口”。
    社论说：“一天比一天明显，美国人正阴谋为破坏朝鲜停战制造藉口。首先他们把印度和亚洲其他中立国家排斥在政治会议以外，使政治会议的成功更加困难。现在他们又进而攻击印度军队。”“他们想迫使印度军队撤退，那样与战俘当面谈话就不可能了。美国政府对待战俘问题的奸险手段是任何政府都不曾使用过的。”
    社论最后说：“英国人民应该迫使他们的政府对美国的破坏手段立即提出抗议。”
    【新华社六日讯】孟买消息：“印度时报”斥责美国阻挠和破坏战俘遣返工作。该报五日以“背信”为题，发表社论说：美国“在对待整个遣返朝鲜战俘问题上所采取的做法是很不能令人满意的”。社论说：“从它的发言人的谈话和态度看来，到目前为止，他们对阻碍解决遣返问题似乎更有兴趣。很可以问问美国：究竟它是要和平呢还是要战争？假若它要和平，那么现在已经到了时候，美国发言人的油腔滑调应该变得合理一些，负责一些，令人信服一些。假若它不要和平，那么现在也到了丢开一切装腔作势的姿态的时候。那种想破坏或拖延这一方或另一方战俘的遣返的阴谋，完全是背叛那些诚心诚意渴望结束朝鲜战争的人们的勾当。”社论说：“要奉告汉布伦和他的侍从们的是他们都以免开尊口为妙。”
      【新华社平壤六日电】朝鲜中央通讯社六日发表评论，揭露美国和李承晚集团缔结的所谓“共同防御条约”的侵略本质。评论指出：美国在联合国大会上反对政治会议的合理组成的提议以后，又在十月一日和李承晚伪政府正式签署了所谓“韩美共同防御条约”。很明显，首先要讨论从朝鲜撤出外国军队问题的政治会议和企图使美军长期驻留南朝鲜的所谓“韩美共同防御条约”是毫无共同之处的。但是，美国国务卿杜勒斯在演说中却仍然企图以老一套的逻辑来掩饰这个条约的侵略本质，说什么“侵略势力”仍构成对它们的威胁，这个条约有利于“太平洋自由国家的集体安全”；还说什么美国希望政治会议召开并达成和平协议。
    评论指出：然而，谁都知道，除了美英集团以外是别无任何侵略势力存在的。和其仆从国家签订了许多侵略性的军事条约和同盟的正是美国。美国并企图策划以日本军国主义为骨干的所谓太平洋同盟，企图在“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的恶毒计划下动员日本武士及蒋介石、李承晚匪帮等挑拨战争。杜勒斯任何狡猾的言辞都是掩盖不了旨在阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决的“韩美共同防御条约”的侵略本质的。
    评论强调说：全朝鲜人民和全体爱好和平的人民一道，痛斥这个侵略性的条约的签字和美国破坏政治会议的阴谋。全朝鲜人民决心为粉碎美帝国主义的战争阴谋而继续斗争。
