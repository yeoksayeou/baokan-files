    “If we had done it this way, we could have saved coal long ago!”
    —A record of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot’s efforts to save locomotive coal

    The Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Administration planned to save 200 tons of locomotive coal in the first quarter of this year. The leading cadres of the depot, without considering the specifics, simply distributed this task to each operating crew at the workers' representative meeting. The Li Qi operating crew, which had consistently consumed 187 tons of coal for eight consecutive months, was also assigned the task of saving 10 tons of coal. As a result, this group not only failed to save coal in January but actually wasted 37 tons.
    The leading cadres of the depot adopted simple and crude methods towards the coal-consuming operating crews: sarcasm, attacks, naming and shaming at meetings, suspension for self-reflection, and demanding written self-criticisms... For example, when the Ren Songlin operating crew wasted coal, the depot head would have a "special talk" with Ren Songlin, and big-character posters, broadcasts, and public criticism sessions in the depot would all question the crew, demanding answers. This made Ren Songlin afraid to return to the depot. Although the depot was so "tense," the results were precisely the opposite of what the leading cadres wanted. The coal-consuming locomotives continued to consume coal, or even more so. In January, the entire depot not only failed to save coal but also wasted 47 tons more.
    After February, the depot learned from past mistakes and changed its leadership methods: it learned from the experience of Factory 53, clearly established the idea of relying on the masses, and made self-criticisms to the masses. It organized special groups to conduct in-depth investigations and research to identify the main keys to saving coal and wasting coal: on the one hand, the crew members lacked a sense of ownership in their labor and had not implemented advanced working methods; on the other hand, the leadership had not promptly resolved certain locomotive quality problems (insufficient hoop tension, poor oil quality, cylinder scratches, etc.). In response to this situation, the depot convened a meeting of guiding drivers and driver chiefs, summarized and disseminated the advanced thinking of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive operating crew, which was to "cherish the locomotive as if cherishing one's own pocket watch," and that "saving coal is like managing a household, counting every shovelful and calculating every two liang," and introduced the "Mao Zedong" locomotive operating crew's "curve release method," "crossing unfavorable water stations," "large coal at the bottom," and "small shovel firing" and other advanced working methods, and solved the common problems of simultaneous boiling of steam and water and tumor formation in locomotives. At the same time, in order to improve locomotive quality, the depot proposed eight topics, mobilized the masses to use their brains, find tricks, and put forward rationalization proposals, and as a result, solved the problems of increased boiler scale, leakage in smoke chambers, steam chambers, and cylinders, greatly improving locomotive quality. Later, the depot provided specific assistance to the Li Qi operating crew, overcoming the erroneous thinking of veteran driver Zhang Baiyuan, who thought "being old and childless means there's no future," and fireman Tian Qingzhu, who thought "firing with a large shovel, throwing a few more shovels means more rest," and promoted the advanced working methods of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, enabling the Li Qi operating crew to save 44 tons of locomotive coal in March. It also widely publicized the transformation experience of the Li Qi operating crew, which played a significant role in promoting other operating crews. Crew members generally reflected: "If we had done it this way, we could have saved coal long ago!" In this way, the task of saving coal was no longer simply a matter for the leadership, but became a conscious action of all crew members in the depot. The monthly coal-saving plan was not only formulated by the crew members themselves, but also continuously revised and improved during the production process. Under the active leadership of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive operating crew, the freight locomotive team of the entire depot revised and increased the original coal-saving plan for March by 50%. Crew members' mutual exchange of experience has become an indispensable system in daily labor. Therefore, the coal-saving figures of each operating crew in the depot are close to balance, overcoming the past phenomenon of large discrepancies in coal-saving differences. In the past six months, the depot has saved more than 1,800 tons of locomotive coal for the state.

    “这样搞，早就可以省煤啦！”
    ——记丰台机务段节约机煤的经过
    屈先觉
    北京铁路管理局丰台机务段今年第一季度计划节省机煤二百吨，该段的领导干部在职工代表大会上不管三七二十一就把这个任务分摊给每个包乘组。有一个连续八个月费煤一百八十七吨的李起包乘组，也被摊派了省煤十吨的任务。结果，该组一月份不但没有省煤，反而浪费了三十七吨。
    该段领导干部对费煤的包乘组采取了简单粗暴的办法：讽刺，打击，大会点名，停职反省，限期检讨……。比如任松林包乘组费了煤，段长就找任松林“特别谈话”，段内的大字报、广播、点将台都朝这个小组提出质问，要求答复。弄得任松林不敢回段。该段虽然如此“紧张”，但结果与领导干部的要求恰恰相反，费煤机车依然费煤，或者更加严重；一月份全段机车不但没有省煤，还多费了四十七吨。
    二月以后，该段接受了过去的教训，改变了领导方法：学习五三工厂的经验，明确树立了依靠群众的思想，并向群众作了检讨。组织专门小组深入调查研究，找出省煤和费煤的主要关键：一方面是乘务员缺乏主人翁的劳动态度，没有推行先进工作方法；另一方面，领导上对有些机车质量问题（涨圈能力不够，油质不良，汽室擦伤等）没有及时解决。针对这种情况，该段召开了指导司机和司机长会议，总结与传播了毛泽东号机车包乘组“爱护机车像爱护自己的怀表一样”，“省煤好比过日子，要一锹一锹的数，二两二两的算”的先进思想，并介绍毛泽东号机车包乘组所创造的“弯道放法”，“越过不良验水站”，“块煤打底”和“小铣焚火”等先进工作方法，解决了带有普遍性的机车汽水共腾和生瘤子等问题。与此同时，该段为了提高机车质量，提出八个课题，发动群众开动脑筋、找窍门、提合理化建议，结果解决了机车锅炉水锈增长，烟室、汽室，汽缸泄漏等问题，使机车质量提高了一大步。以后，该段对李起包乘组进行具体帮助，克服了老司机张柏元“年老无子没奔头”和司炉田清柱“烧火用大锹，多扔几锹多休息”的错误思想，推行了毛泽东号机车的先进工作方法，使李起包乘组在三月份也节省机煤四十四吨。并广泛宣传李起包乘组的转变经验，对其他包乘组起了很大的推动作用。乘务员普遍反映：“这样搞，早就可以省煤啦！”这样一来，省煤任务再不单纯是领导上的事，而成为全段乘务员自觉的行动，每月省煤计划不但是由乘务员自己来制订，并要在生产过程中不断地修订提高，在毛泽东号机车包乘组积极带动下，全段货运机车队将三月份省煤原计划修订提高了百分之五十。乘务员互相交流经验，已成为日常劳动中不可缺少的制度。因此全段各包乘组省煤数字接近平衡，克服了过去省煤差额悬殊的现象，半年来给国家共节省了机煤一千八百多吨。
