Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a meeting on the morning of the 14th to welcome the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning for the National Day celebrations. General Yang Dezhi, head of the delegation, and Second-Class Combat Hero Dong Kerong were invited to give reports at the meeting.

Those attending the report meeting included: Li Jishen and Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the National Committee of the CPPCC, members of the Central Committees of various democratic parties in Beijing, and more than 900 working cadres from the National Committee of the CPPCC and various democratic parties, organs, and organizations.

The report meeting was presided over by Vice-Chairman Li Jishen. After delivering a brief opening speech, he invited General Yang Dezhi to give a report. General Yang Dezhi reported in detail on the course and the great victory of the summer counter-attack campaign before the Korean armistice. General Yang Dezhi said: This great victory severely hit the enemy's arrogance against the armistice and promoted the rapid signing of the armistice. General Yang Dezhi described the reasons for the victory, saying: This is because, with the full support of the people of the motherland, our army's equipment, supplies, and overall combat effectiveness have been increasingly strengthened. It is also because our army's tactics and techniques have greatly improved through more than two years of combat training, and the art of coordinated operations between large units and various services has become increasingly advanced. It is also due to the more widespread and higher revolutionary heroism shown by the troops in this counter-attack campaign. Finally, General Yang Dezhi said: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is now continuing to maintain a high degree of vigilance on the front lines in Korea, ready to give a heavier blow to the enemy who dares to undermine the armistice and re-launch an offensive. All commanders and fighters are determined and confident to fight to the end to strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and to defend the security of the motherland and world peace.

After General Yang Dezhi's report, Special-Class Merit Citation recipient and Second-Class Combat Hero Dong Kerong gave a report. In his report, Dong Kerong vividly described his heroic deeds in the battle to counter-attack Height 938.2 in front of Fish Hidden Mountain in June this year, where he continuously commanded 46 combat teams for five days and nights, repelling more than 30 counter-attacks by the enemy with forces ranging from one platoon to two battalions, and killing and wounding more than 1,800 enemy soldiers. All those present repeatedly applauded to express their respect to this heroic platoon leader.

The members of the delegation who were invited to meet with the attendees at this report meeting also included: Special-Class Merit Citation recipient and First-Class Demolition Hero Huang Jiafu; Special-Class Merit Citation recipient and Second-Class Combat Hero Lai Yongze; Special-Class Merit Citation recipient and Second-Class Combat Hero pilot Jiang Daoping; Special-Class Merit Citation recipient and Second-Class Combat Hero Gao Lianglun; Special-Class Merit Citation recipient and Second-Class Combat Hero, Artillery Command Platoon Leader Zhu Jinchi; First-Class Merit Citation recipient and Second-Class Combat Hero Gao Runtian; First-Class Merit Citation recipient and Second-Class Hero, Deputy Company Commander of a Railway Unit Liu Changling; First-Class Merit Citation recipient and Second-Class Model Worker, Military Doctor He Bonian; Special-Class Merit Citation recipient, Truck Unit Squad Leader Chen Youfu; and Special-Class Merit Citation recipient Pan Zhengguang, and others.
