The existing forest area in our country is too small, and timber resources are scarce. As a result, it cannot meet the needs of the country's long-term construction, nor can it protect the vast land and resist wind, sand, floods, and droughts, which greatly threatens agricultural production. This serious situation urgently needs to be changed.

Over the past three years, thanks to the attention of party and government leaders at all levels and the efforts of the broad masses, our country's forestry construction has achieved considerable success. According to current statistics, afforestation nationwide has reached approximately 1.75 million hectares, and mountain closure for reforestation covers 4.14 million hectares. The afforestation area is expanding year by year, and the survival rate of afforestation is also increasing year by year. Scattered tree planting in many areas has developed into large-scale afforestation, and individual afforestation has gradually been organized into cooperative afforestation. Large-scale shelterbelts have begun to be built in the Northeast and Northwest regions and have begun to show protective effects in eastern Henan and western Hebei. Many barren mountains have gradually become forests after being closed for reforestation and have begun to play a role in soil and water conservation. The phenomenon of indiscriminate logging has been basically stopped, and the damage from mountain forest fires has also been reduced year by year. These achievements have undoubtedly laid a preliminary foundation for future work. However, in past work, as in agricultural production, there was a lack of clear understanding that current afforestation, reforestation, and forest protection mainly rely on small-scale individual farmers. There was also an underestimation of their private, decentralized characteristics and difficulties. As a result, in many areas, serious phenomena arose such as excessively large afforestation plans, excessively high demands, and the accompanying assignment of tasks and coercive orders, which were detached from reality and the masses. In addition, due to unclear policies on privately owned forests in the South and excessive intervention in their logging and sale during a certain period, the enthusiasm of farmers to manage forest trees was greatly frustrated. At the same time, due to overly rigid regulations prohibiting slash-and-burn cultivation and steep slope reclamation, there were deviations in the implementation of mountain closure for reforestation, and the production and life of farmers near the mountains and forest farmers lacked due consideration, which also aroused dissatisfaction among some farmers and forest farmers. All these shortcomings and errors must arouse our vigilance and be quickly overcome and corrected.

At present, the completion of land reform nationwide and the upsurge in mass production enthusiasm have provided new and favorable conditions for future forestry construction. Therefore, launching mass afforestation, reforestation, and forest protection work has become a necessary task at present. Only when the mass forestry construction cause is launched and continues to develop can the situation of our country's excessively small forest area be fundamentally changed, thereby gradually reducing natural disasters, increasing agricultural production, increasing the income of mountain residents, and increasing timber resources to support the country's planned economic construction. To smoothly carry out this work nationwide, the State Council hereby issues the following instructions:

I. Launching mass afforestation work is the primary way to expand timber resources and ensure the needs of the country's long-term construction. It is also an effective measure to reduce wind, sand, floods, and droughts and ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture. Therefore, governments at all levels must pay sufficient attention to it and strengthen their leadership. At the same time, they should consult with the local masses based on the different climate, soil, terrain, tree species, and other conditions in each region, as well as the inherent habits and production capabilities of the masses, and propose different requirements and afforestation plans for a certain period according to local conditions. Then, mobilize the masses to implement them step by step, separately and annually. Generally, in areas with serious soil erosion and frequent wind, sand, flood, and drought disasters, actively plant water conservation forests and shelterbelts. In areas with better soil and water conditions and rapid tree growth, vigorously cultivate timber forests. But whether the former or the latter, must act according to local needs and various possible conditions, and act according to ability. Neither should we wait passively and delay opportunities, nor should we be greedy for quick results and rush ahead. We should also pay attention to quality in our work and focus on improving the survival rate.

The construction of larger-scale shelterbelts or water conservation forests is of decisive significance for transforming nature and reducing various disasters and is one of the country's important construction projects. Therefore, all localities should pay great attention to it. However, because it involves too many aspects and has certain difficulties in terms of land, labor, and other issues, except for the western Northeast shelterbelt and the northern Shaanxi sand prevention forest belt, which can steadily advance with reference to the original plan and make necessary corrections, and the sand prevention forests in the lower reaches of the Yongding River in Hebei, western Hebei, and eastern Henan, which can be completed according to the original plan, other shelterbelts such as those in North China (northern former Chahar and northern Suiyuan), Shandong, and northern Jiangsu should be further surveyed in detail and carefully planned by the major administrative regions and provinces before being submitted to the State Council for approval before implementation. In short, when building larger-scale shelterbelts or water conservation forests, we must truly base on the actual needs and possible conditions of each region and sufficiently take care of the private interests of small farmers. Therefore, there is no need to force uniformity in specifications or steps in the planning of shelterbelts, and we should strive to occupy as little cultivated land as possible or not occupy cultivated land. If the occupation of land affects farmers' production and life in some areas, it must be properly resolved. If it cannot be resolved, it is better to postpone or not do it rather than act blindly. In the construction of water conservation forests, we should not be greedy for quick results and should not force the masses to stop cultivating and return farmland to forests. In order to conserve soil and water, although the reclamation of general barren mountain steep slopes should be stopped, if the masses must reclaim them due to compelling reasons in their lives, they should be persuaded to build terraced fields as much as possible and should not be forcibly prohibited. As for the small farmland shelterbelts, small water conservation forests, and general timber forests in various localities, which are closely related to the production and life of the masses in various localities and are favored by the masses, the provincial, county, district, and township governments can plan them separately based on their size, needs, possibilities, and the wishes of the masses, and actively advocate them.

Regarding afforestation methods, the main thing at present is to rely on mobilizing the broad masses of farmers to carry out afforestation. Therefore, sufficient attention and care must be given to the dispersed and private nature of the broad masses of farmers. We must resolutely implement the policy of "whoever plants it owns it, whoever plants it together owns it together, and whoever plants it in the village owns it in the village" and earnestly protect the ownership. While promoting mutual aid afforestation and cooperative afforestation, we should also pay attention to giving play to the enthusiasm of farmers' individual afforestation without causing any damage. The tree seedlings required for mass afforestation mainly rely on mobilizing villages, households, mutual aid groups, and cooperatives to collect seeds and cultivate seedlings themselves for solutions. However, for those who have special difficulties in seedlings at present, the state should provide assistance based on the degree of seedling difficulties and the state's possibilities, such as providing seeds free of charge, mobilizing them to cultivate seedlings themselves, or providing seedlings free of charge, to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation.

For large-scale shelterbelts, water conservation forests, and timber forests that are far from villages or require labor that the masses cannot afford, or large areas of barren mountains and wasteland in some sections, the state must make overall plans and be responsible for construction. The local people's government forestry organs should formulate plans and implement them in stages based on the different conditions in each region. The method can be for the state to establish afforestation stations and directly hire workers for construction, or to mobilize farmers with afforestation experience in the local area to organize mutual aid groups and cooperatives to contract for planting and survival by sections, with the state providing certain compensation and tree seedlings and providing technical guidance. In addition, nearby farmers can be organized to carry out afforestation with certain assistance from the state (such as seedlings and food) during the slack farming season. The planted trees can also be divided into prizes with the masses by signing contracts. However, under the current conditions, it is not advisable to demand too much or plan too much, but we should not wait passively and lose opportunities.

Secondly, near mines, a certain area can be delineated for the mining area to be responsible for construction, and along railways and highways, the railway and highway departments should gradually green them, and the planted trees will be used by the mining area and railway and highway departments in the future.

II. After afforestation, it is necessary to strengthen tending to promote the development and growth of trees. The county, district, and township governments in the areas where afforestation has been carried out should organize and lead the masses to tend young forests and prevent them from being destroyed after planting, causing waste. For the forests that have been formed in various localities, they should be pruned or thinned according to the forest appearance and growth conditions, and other necessary tending work should be carried out to promote their normal growth and rapid timber production.

After forest logging, the logging site should be renewed immediately to cultivate new forests, so that the forest can continue to be used continuously. In the future, the forestry industry departments must earnestly implement the policy of rational logging, combined with logging operations, immediately clean up the forest farms to promote the natural renewal of the forest and create favorable conditions for artificial renewal. In the state-owned forest areas in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and other natural forest areas in Southwest and Northwest China, the forestry departments should set up specialized agencies to gradually restore the forests in the logging sites by means of artificial renewal. In various private forest areas, especially in the private forest areas in Jiangnan, the masses have a long history of managing trees and have rich experience in forest tending and logging site renewal, so they should be actively promoted and promoted. Local governments and forestry organs should also provide necessary assistance and guidance so that the trees can grow and recover rapidly.

Closing mountains for reforestation is the most effective way to naturally afforest barren mountains and conserve soil and water, and the masses should still be called upon and led to carry it out. However, it must be carried out based on the conditions of the barren mountains and the possibility of reforestation, especially taking into account the needs of firewood collection, grazing, etc., and on the basis of the masses' voluntary and conscious efforts. As for which mountains to close, which mountains not to close, when to close, when to open, and in the same mountain area, which tree species to close and which tree species not to close, the masses of each township and village can decide by themselves or through the people's congresses. Governments at all levels should no longer make rigid regulations or list them as tasks to be deployed downward.

III. While carrying out afforestation and reforestation work, we must pay more attention to protecting existing trees. Although forest fires and indiscriminate logging have decreased compared with the past reactionary rule, various accidents still occur frequently, especially the losses caused by forest fires are still serious. Therefore, protecting existing forests from fire, destruction, and various natural disasters such as diseases and insect pests should still be regarded as a serious task in forestry work at present. In particular, the prevention of forest fires should be given widespread attention, and the greatest efforts should be made to mobilize and organize the masses to strictly prevent them, especially for large-scale state-owned forests, it is necessary to ensure their safety. The cause of forest fires is mostly due to slash-and-burn cultivation, therefore, preventing forest fires still requires prohibiting slash-and-burn cultivation. However, it is also necessary to take into account the actual conditions of various regions and the actual needs of the masses in production, and there should be no generalization between forest areas, semi-forest areas, and non-forest areas. Those who have special needs in production should be taken care of. Especially in ethnic minority areas, the masses have the habit of burning mountains for production and life needs. In Inner Mongolia, it is necessary to burn pastures for grazing. In the Jiangnan rotten wood forest area, there is a habit of "refining mountains" when inserting branches. In these areas, it is necessary to conduct in-depth mass education to explain the advantages and disadvantages, lead the masses to actively improve farming methods, and at the same time, according to the actual needs of the masses, allow them to carry out necessary mountain burning under the condition of ensuring that no fire occurs.

In addition, we must continue to strictly prohibit indiscriminate logging that destroys forests. However, we must also pay attention to the production and life needs of the masses who live near the mountains and their habit of "relying on the mountains to eat the mountains." On the one hand, we must combine the interests of the masses and conduct in-depth education on "eating the mountains must nourish the mountains." On the other hand, we should allow the masses to enter the mountains to engage in sideline production or assist the state in forest tending work according to local conditions or from time to time.

In short, forest protection and fire prevention must rely on the masses, therefore, we must pay attention to their regionality and seasonality, and more importantly, we must combine the local interests of the masses with the overall interests to be effective. It is not possible to make mechanical regulations that are common throughout the country and the region.

Secondly, the harm of diseases and insect pests to forests has become more and more serious, especially the spread and rampant of insect pests, which is particularly harmful to forests. Therefore, all localities must deeply absorb and study the local people's experience in pest control, mobilize the masses to actively fight pests, and at the same time, according to the current possibilities, use various scientific methods to effectively prevent and control them.

IV. Since afforestation, reforestation, and forest protection work mainly rely on the broad masses at present, and this mass is an individual farmer who is a small producer and small owner, therefore, we must strictly protect the interests of the farmers themselves. Only in this way can we give play to the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation and forest protection. To this end:

    (1) We must determine forest rights and protect mountain and forest ownership. Except for state-owned forest areas, all forest mountains confiscated from landlords that have not been distributed or whose forest rights have not been determined after land reform and should be distributed to farmers according to law should be distributed to individual farmers, joint ownership, or village collective ownership taking into account the original historical habits and current situation. In the Jiangnan area, this work should be started after the land distribution is completed or after the land review is completed, and it should not be delayed for too long, nor should it be done hastily, so as to avoid mass disputes and mountain and forest destruction. For those that have been distributed and have disputes, the local government should resolve them through consultation based on the original habits, taking into account the current situation, and in the spirit of unity and mutual assistance. All mountains and forests owned or distributed to farmers, whether economic crop mountains, fruit mountains, or timber mountains, should have the right to freely log, use, and sell them, and no one shall interfere. The method of requiring farmers to obtain the approval of the local government or forestry organ for logging their own trees in the past should be stopped immediately, but they should be educated and dissuaded from indiscriminate logging and lack of conservation.

    (2) In the private forest areas in the South, a policy of free timber transactions under the strict management of the state should be adopted within a certain range, and the policy of comprehensive timber control should be abolished. The specific implementation methods shall be stipulated by each province based on local conditions and submitted to the State Council for approval before implementation. In addition, a correct price policy must be implemented. Prices that are too high or too low are likely to cause damage to trees. In order to reasonably regulate market prices, when approving purchase prices, state purchasing agencies should approve them at several timber distribution centers in their respective regions based on the state's prescribed indicators and the interests of production, transportation, and sales, as well as the price changes over the years, rather than simply using the method of directly calculating the mountain price.

    (3) In ethnic minority areas where land reform has not been implemented, the ownership, logging rights, sales rights, and inheritance rights of their mountains and forests shall be effectively protected in accordance with past ownership habits and scope, and they shall be encouraged to actively carry out afforestation and increase production.

Only by implementing the above policies and paying attention to technical guidance, organizational management, and political work can afforestation, reforestation, and forest protection work achieve practical results.

V. In order to effectively ensure the balanced development of forestry construction and industrial and agricultural construction, carrying out afforestation, reforestation, and forest protection work should become one of the main tasks of governments at all levels, especially governments at all levels in mountainous areas, and should become one of the important topics of people's congresses at all levels. When arranging rural work, governments at all levels should include forestry work as a necessary content and make unified plans and unified arrangements. Any isolated forestry work or the practice of canceling forestry work when implementing the "agricultural production overrides everything" policy is not advisable. In addition, in order to strengthen the leadership of this work, it is also necessary to strengthen it in terms of organizational structure. In addition to strengthening the existing forestry institutions, special commissioners should be appointed at the county and district levels to be responsible for forestry work and afforestation stations and tending stations should be established in the main afforestation areas and tending and renewal areas. The specific deployment is the responsibility of the major administrative regions and the relevant provincial people's governments to handle as appropriate.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于发动群众开展造林、育林、护林工作的指示
    （一九五三年七月九日政务院第一百八十五次政务会议通过）
    我国现有森林面积过小，木材资源贫乏，因之，既不能满足国家长期建设的需要，又不能庇护广大土地，抵抗风沙水旱，致农业生产受到极大威胁。此种严重情况，亟须加以改变。
    三年多来，由于党政各级领导的重视和广大群众的努力，我国林业建设已获得相当成就。根据现有统计：全国造林已约达一七五万公顷，封山育林四一四万公顷。造林面积正在逐年扩大，造林成活率也在逐年提高。许多地区的零星植树已发展成为成片造林，个体造林已逐步组织起来成为合作造林。较大面积的防护林已在东北、西北地区开始营造；并在豫东、冀西等地开始收到防护效果。不少荒山经封山育林后，已逐渐成林，并开始发生保持水土的作用。滥伐森林现象已基本停止，山林火灾损害也在逐年减轻。这些成就无疑已为今后工作打下了初步基础。但在过去工作中也和农业生产一样，因对目前造林、育林、护林所依靠的主要是小生产者的个体农民这一点认识不清，并对他们的私有性、分散性的特点与困难估计不足，因而在许多地区便产生了造林计划过大，要求过高，以及由此相伴而来的分派任务、强迫命令等脱离实际、脱离群众的严重现象。另外，由于对南方私有林政策不明确，并在某一时期对其采伐与出卖采取过多干涉的政策，因而使农民经营林木的积极性遭到了很大的挫折；同时由于禁止烧垦烧荒和禁垦陡坡等规定的过于机械，封山育林工作在执行上有偏差，对山林附近农民的生产和生活缺乏应有的照顾，因而也招致部分农民和林农的不满。所有这些缺点和错误，必须引起我们警惕，并迅速加以克服和纠正。
    目前，全国范围内土地改革的完成，群众生产积极性的高涨，给今后林业建设提供了新的有利条件，因之，开展群众性的造林、育林、护林工作已经是成为目前必要的任务；而且也只有群众性的林业建设事业被发动起来并不断地持续下去，才能从根本上改变我国森林面积过小的情况，从而逐渐减免天灾、增加农业生产、增加山区群众收入、增加木材资源，以配合国家有计划的经济建设。为在全国范围内顺利开展这一工作，本院特作如下指示：
    一、开展群众性的造林工作是扩大木材资源、保证国家长期建设需要的首要办法；也是减免风沙水旱灾害、保障农业丰收的有效措施。因此，各级政府必须引起足够的重视，并加强其领导；同时应该根据各个地区的不同气候、土壤地形、树种等情况，及群众固有习惯与生产能力等条件和当地群众共同商量，因地制宜地提出不同要求和一定时期的造林计划，然后发动群众分头分年逐步实现。大体上在水土冲刷严重、风沙水旱灾害经常发生的地区，应积极营造水源林和防护林；在水土条件较好林木生长迅速的地区，应大力培育用材林。但无论前者或后者，均须根据当地需要和各种可能条件，量力而行；既不应消极等待，延误时机，也不可贪多冒进，操之过急；并应在工作上讲求质量，着重提高成活率。
    对规模较大的防护林带或水源林的营造，因对改造自然和减免各种灾害有决定意义，且为国家重要建设之一，故各地仍应予以极大重视。但因其牵涉面过大，且在土地、劳力等问题上有一定困难，故除东北西部防护林带和陕北防沙林带可参照原计划并作必要修正后稳步前进及河北永定河下游、冀西、豫东等防沙林可按原计划完成外，其他如华北
  （原察哈尔北部及绥远北部）、山东、苏北等地之防护林带，则应由各大区、省再加详细勘察，周密计划，报政务院核准后方可进行。总之，在营造较大规模的防护林或水源林时，必须切实根据各个地区的实际需要和可能条件，并足够地照顾到小农的私有利益，因此在防护林带的规划方面，既不必在规格上或步调上强求一致，并应力求少占耕地或不占耕地。对某些地区因占地后影响农民的生产生活者，必须妥善予以解决；如无法解决时，则宁可缓办不办，不可蛮干。在水源林的营造上，不可贪多求快，不应强迫群众停耕还林。为了保持水土，对一般荒山陡坡虽应停止开垦，但如果群众在生活上由于迫不得已而必须开垦时，应尽量劝导群众筑成梯田，而不应强制加以禁止。至于各地之小型农田防护林，小片水源林及一般用材林，因与各地群众的生产和生活息息相关，为各地群众所乐为，故可由各省、县、区、乡政府根据其规模之大小、需要和可能，以及群众意愿，分别加以规划，积极加以倡导。
    关于造林方式，目前主要的还是依靠发动广大农民群众来进行，因而对广大农民群众的分散性和私有性就必须予以足够的注意和照顾，必须坚决贯彻谁种谁有、伙种伙有、村种村有的政策，切实保障所有权。在提倡互助造林和合作造林的同时，也应注意发挥农民个体造林的积极性而不应加以任何损伤。群众造林所需树苗，主要依靠发动各村各户各互助组、合作社自己采种育苗来求解决；但对目前种苗特别困难者，则应根据对种苗的困难程度和国家的可能情况，由国家分别以无代价地供给种子、发动其自行育苗、或无代价地供给苗木等办法予以帮助，鼓励群众造林的积极性。
    在某些距离村庄较远或劳力困难为群众力所不及的大规模防护林、水源林和用材林，或其中某些地段中的大片荒山荒地，势必由国家统筹计划，负责营造，地方人民政府林业机关应根据各地不同情况，制订计划，分期进行。其方式可由国家建立造林站，直接雇工营造；或动员当地有植树经验之农民组织互助组、合作社，分区分段，包种包活，国家给以一定酬偿，并供树苗，加以技术指导；此外，亦可组织附近农民，在农闲时，由国家给以一定资助（如苗树、口粮等），进行造林。所造之林木亦可与群众订立合同分成提奖。但在目前条件下，不宜要求过急，计划过大，但也不应消极等待，丧失时机。
    其次在矿山附近可划定一定范围由矿区负责营造，在铁路公路两旁则应由铁路公路部门分期加以绿化，所植林木将来即归矿区和铁路公路部门使用。
    二、造林以后必须加强抚育，以促进林木的发育和成长。在已经造林地区的各县、区、乡政府，应组织和领导群众抚育幼林，防止随植随毁，造成浪费。对各地已成之林，则应根据林相和生长情况，分别加以修枝或间伐，并进行其他必要的抚育工作，以促进其正常生长和迅速成材。
    森林采伐后，应即进行迹地更新，育成新林，使森林延续不绝，源源利用。森林工业部门今后必须切实贯彻合理采伐方针，结合采伐作业，随即清理林场，以促进森林天然更新，并给人工更新创造有利条件。在东北、内蒙等国有林区或西南、西北等部分天然林区，应由林业部门设置专业机构，在采伐迹地用人工更新办法使之逐渐恢复成林。在各私有林地区，特别是江南各私有林地区，群众原有经营林木的悠久历史，且对森林抚育和采伐后的迹地更新也有丰富经验，故应积极加以提倡和推广。地方政府和林业机关亦应予以必要的帮助和指导，以便林木迅速成长和恢复。
    封山育林是使荒山自然成林和保持水土的最有效办法，仍应号召与领导群众进行。但必须根据荒山的条件和育林的可能性，尤须照顾到樵采放牧等需要，在群众自觉自愿基础上进行封禁。至于那些山要封，那些山不封，何时封禁，何时开禁，同一山区，那些树种封禁，那些树种不禁，则可由各乡各村群众或经过人民代表会议自行决定，各级政府不应再作硬性规定，或列为任务，向下布置。
    三、与开展造林、育林工作的同时，必须更加重视保护现有林木。几年来森林火灾和滥伐情况，虽较过去反动统治时代有所减少，但各种事故仍迭出不穷，特别是森林火灾所造成的损失依然严重。因此，保护现有森林免受火灾，免受破坏，免受病虫等各种自然灾害，在目前仍应视为林业工作中一项严重的任务。特别是防止森林火灾更应引起普遍重视，并应尽最大的努力发动组织群众，严加防止，尤其是对大面积国有林，一定要保证其安全。森林火灾的原因，大部分由于烧垦烧荒，因此，防止森林火灾仍须禁止烧垦烧荒；但也必须顾及到各地区的实际情况和群众在生产上的实际需要，林区、半林区和非林区不可一般化，群众在生产上特别需要者，应予以照顾。特别在少数民族地区，为了生产与生活的需要，群众有烧山的习惯；在内蒙，为了放牧，需烧牧场；江南朽木林区，插条时有“炼山”的习惯。在这些地区，必须一面深入群众教育，说明利害，领导群众积极改进耕作方法，一面则应根据群众的确实需要，准许他们在保证不发生火灾的条件下，进行必要的烧山。
    另外，必须对破坏森林的滥伐行为继续严加禁止；但也必须注意到靠山群众生产和生活的需要及其“靠山吃山”的习惯，一方面要结合群众利益，深入“吃山必须养山”教育；一方面则应因地制宜或因时制宜地准许群众入山搞副业生产，或协助国家进行森林抚育工作。
    总之，护林防火要依靠群众，因而必须注意其地域性与季节性，更必须把群众的局部利益和整体利益结合起来，才有效力，不可做出全国全区通行的机械规定。
    其次，病虫害对森林的为害已益加严重，特别是虫害的蔓延和猖獗，对森林的为害尤为严重。因此，各地必须深入地吸取和研究当地群众扑虫经验，发动群众积极扑打，同时根据现有可能，利用各种科学办法有效的加以防治。
    四、既然造林、育林、护林工作在目前主要的还是依靠广大群众，而这种群众又是小生产小私有者的个体农民，因此，就必须严格保护农民的本身利益，只有这样才能发挥群众对造林护林的积极性。为此：
      （一）必须确定林权，保护山林所有权。除国有林区外，凡没收地主之林山尚未分配或土改后林权尚未确定而又依法应分配给农民者，应在照顾原有历史习惯与现实情况下分配给农民个人所有、伙有或乡村公有；在江南地区更应在土地分配完了后或土地复查过后，即开始领导农民进行这一工作，不可拖得过久，亦不能草率从事，以免引起群众纠纷和山林破坏。对已分配而有纠纷者，当地政府应根据原有习惯，照顾现实情况，本团结互助精神，采协商办法解决之。凡农民自有或分得之山林，不论经济作物山、果子山或木材山，均应有自由采伐、使用、出卖等处理权限，任何人不得加以干涉；过去各地农民采伐自有林木须经地方政府或林业机关批准的办法应即停止执行，但对其滥伐林木、不加保育的现象，则应进行教育，加以劝止。
      （二）在南方私有林地区，应在一定范围内采取国家严格管理下的木材交易自由政策，废除木材全面统制政策。其具体实施办法，由各省根据当地情况规定，呈报政务院核准后执行。另外，并须实行正确的价格政策。价格过高过低均易引起对林木的破坏。为了合理调节市场价格，国家收购机关在核定收购价格时，应在所属地区内若干木材集散地点根据国家规定的指标和产运销三方面利益及历年价格变化情况来核定，而不宜只采用单一的直接计算山价的方法来核定。
    （三）凡未实行土地改革的少数民族地区，其山林所有权、采伐权、出卖权、承继权，一律根据过去归属习惯和范围，切实加以保护，并鼓励他们积极造林，增加生产。
    只有贯彻了上述政策，并从技术指导、组织管理、政治工作各方面加以注意，造林、育林、护林工作才能获得实效。
    五、为有效地保证林业建设和工农业建设的平衡发展，开展造林、育林、护林工作应成为今后各级政府特别是山区的各级政府的主要任务之一，并应成为各级人民代表大会的重要议题之一。各级政府在布置农村工作时，应将林业工作列为应有内容，并作统一计划和统一安排，任何孤立地开展林业工作，或在贯彻“农业生产压倒一切”方针时，取消了林业工作的做法，都是不应该的。另外为加强对这一工作的领导，还必须在组织机构上予以加强，除已有的各种林业机构应予加强外，各主要造林地区和抚育更新地区，还应在县区两级指定专员担任林业工作和设立造林站和抚育站。其具体部署，责成各大区行政委员会和有关省人民政府酌情办理。
