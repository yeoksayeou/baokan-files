Reader's Letters Summary:

    Harbin Health School has too many faculty and staff members
    A reader from Harbin Health School, Weili, writes: Our school is a secondary medical school directly under the leadership of the Ministry of Railways, with approximately nine hundred students. However, there are nearly three hundred faculty and staff members (including four principals), accounting for one-third of the student population, resulting in a serious situation of overstaffing. For example, our school already has a director of general affairs, but there is also a vice-principal specifically in charge of general affairs. Furthermore, there are only fifty-five party members in the entire school, but there are seven full-time cadres working on party affairs. I suggest that the Ministry of Railways make appropriate adjustments to the personnel of our school to correct this waste of manpower.

    哈尔滨卫生学校教职人员过多
    哈尔滨卫生学校读者维里来信：我校是中央铁道部直接领导的中级医士学校，约有九百个学生。但是，教职人员却将近三百人（校长就有四个），达学员人数三分之一，人浮于事的情况很严重。如我校已有一位总务主任，却还有一位副校长专管总务工作。又如全校仅有五十五个党员，而做党务工作的专职干部就有七人。我建议中央铁道部适当调整我校人员，纠正这种浪费人力的现象。
