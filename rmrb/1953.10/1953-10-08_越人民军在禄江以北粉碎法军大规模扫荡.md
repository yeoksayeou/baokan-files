The Viet People's Army Smashes Large-Scale French Sweep North of the Luc River
[Xinhua News Agency, 4th] According to Vietnam News Agency: The spokesman of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army issued a statement on September 29th saying: The People's Army troops smashed the enemy's sweep by seventeen battalions in the area north of the Luc River on the left bank of the Red River last week, wiping out more than 630 enemy troops.

On September 23rd, the enemy mustered seventeen mobile battalions, and under the support of artillery, warships, and aircraft, advanced in three routes into the area north of the Luc River on the left bank of the Red River, attempting to eliminate the regular and local forces of the People's Army in this area. The advancing enemy forces were resisted by the People's Army everywhere and suffered heavy losses. According to current incomplete reports, the enemy's First Column, coming from Dongli, was counterattacked by the People's Army in Anse on September 23rd, losing 310 men. The next day, the enemy's Second Column, advancing from Ningjiang towards Fujie, was again resisted by the People's Army, losing 225 men. The enemy's Third Column coming from Jise was wiped out by 100 men. The People's Army also sank four enemy motorboats. The enemy forces, having suffered heavy losses, were forced to withdraw from this area in a hurry on September 25th, and even the wounded were not taken away.

The People's Army spokesman pointed out that this sweep was the largest sweep launched by French Commander-in-Chief in Indochina, General Navarre, since taking office, but it has ended in a heavy defeat. The enemy not only failed to achieve its goal of annihilating the People's Army, but was annihilated by the People's Army instead. The spokesman said that the People's Army in the areas on the right bank of the Red River and in central North Vietnam cooperated with the battle north of the Luc River and strengthened its offensive against the French army. It is worth pointing out that on September 25th, two lightly armed companies of the enemy were annihilated in Peizhu; and a company of the enemy's First Mobile Regiment was annihilated in Meigui, Nam Dinh Province.

The spokesman said that the enemy recently launched a sweeping battle in the area north of the Luc River for two reasons: First, the French army has suffered serious losses in the area on the left bank of the Red River since the beginning of September. Second, the guerrilla bases in the area on the left bank of the Red River have been continuously expanding, and the people's armed forces have become increasingly strong, posing a huge threat to the enemy's rear heartland.

The spokesman finally said that the recent failure of the French colonialists on the north bank of the Luc River is a major failure of Navarre's attempt to eliminate the People's Army. However, we must be more vigilant against the enemy's new conspiracies, because after this failure, Navarre may launch another sweeping battle against our enemy's rear bases and liberated areas in order to prepare for our autumn and winter campaigns.

    越人民军在禄江以北粉碎法军大规模扫荡
    【新华社四日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总司令部发言人在九月二十九日发表声明说：人民军部队上周在红河左岸禄江以北地区粉碎敌军十七个营的扫荡，歼灭敌军六百三十多名。
    九月二十三日，敌人纠集了十七个机动营，在大炮、军舰和飞机支援下分三路向红河左岸禄江以北地区进犯，企图消灭这个地区的人民军正规部队和地方部队。进犯的敌军到处遭到人民军的阻击，损失很大。据目前不完全的报告，来自东里的敌军第一纵队于九月二十三日在安世遭到人民军的反击，损失三百一十人。第二天，从宁江向府巨进犯的敌第二纵队又被人民军阻击，损失二百二十五人。来自计瑟的敌第三纵队被歼一百人。人民军同时击沉敌军汽艇四艘。损失很大的敌军在九月二十五日被迫匆忙撤出这个地区，伤兵甚至也未及运走。
    人民军发言人指出：这次扫荡是印度支那法军总司令纳瓦尔到任以来所发动的最大的一次扫荡，但它已以沉重的失败而结束。这次敌人不仅没有能够达到歼灭人民军的目的，反而被人民军所歼灭。发言人说：在红河右岸地区和北越中部的人民军曾配合禄江以北的战斗，加强向法军发动进攻。值得指出的是：九月二十五日在裴朱歼灭敌军两个轻装连；在南定省的美瑰歼灭敌人第一机动团的一个连。
    发言人说：敌人最近在禄江以北地区发动扫荡战有两个原因：第一，法军自九月初以来在红河左岸地区遭受了严重损失。第二，红河左岸地区的游击基地已不断扩大，人民武装力量愈来愈坚强，成为敌人后方心脏的巨大威胁。
    发言人最后说：法国殖民者最近在禄江北岸的失败，是纳瓦尔想消灭人民军的企图的重大失败。但是我们必须对敌人的新阴谋更加警惕，因为纳瓦尔在这次失败之后，也许会向我们的敌后根据地和解放区发动另一次扫荡战，以便准备应付我们的秋冬战役。
