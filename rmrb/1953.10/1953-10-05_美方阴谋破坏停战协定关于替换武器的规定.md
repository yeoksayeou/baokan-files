Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th - The Korean-Chinese side delegation to the Military Armistice Commission issued the following communique on the 3rd:

    Article 13D of the Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates that both sides of the Korean Armistice should cease the introduction of reinforcing combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons and ammunition from outside Korea after the armistice. During the armistice period, damaged or depleted combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons and ammunition can only be replaced on a one-for-one basis, with the same performance and type, through the ports stipulated in the Armistice Agreement, under the supervision and inspection of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams. However, the US side has recently repeatedly claimed that parts and disassembled components of combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons and ammunition should not be subject to the above restrictions. This means that the US side can disassemble combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons and ammunition into parts or disassembled components and transport them into South Korea, where they can be assembled into complete combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons and ammunition. The Korean-Chinese side firmly opposes this US claim, which is a clear violation of the Armistice Agreement.

    At the same time, the US side has recently repeatedly suggested that the combat aircraft stipulated in Article 13D of the Armistice Agreement should not include aircraft with certain equipment that can be equipped with destructive weapons at any time. According to this suggestion from the US side, the US side can temporarily remove the guns from a fighter jet and transport it into Korea under the name of a so-called "non-combat aircraft"; and the guns removed from the fighter jet, according to the US's previous claim, can be freely transported into Korea in the name of parts or disassembled components, and then reinstalled on the original fighter jet. In this way, the provisions of Article 13D of the Armistice Agreement will become a mere scrap of paper. The Korean-Chinese side has resolutely rejected this absurd suggestion from the US side.

    According to the reports of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed at South Korean ports to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, it has been discovered on numerous occasions that the US side has not complied with the provisions of Article 13D of the Armistice Agreement, and the military materials it has transported into South Korea do not match what it reported to the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams. Now, the US side has come up with the above-mentioned trick of dividing the whole into parts and then reassembling the parts into a whole, attempting to virtually tear up Article 13D of the Armistice Agreement in its entirety, in order to step up its conspiracy to arm the Syngman Rhee puppet army.

    Based on the spirit of strictly implementing the Armistice Agreement, the Korean-Chinese side firmly maintains that the parts and disassembled components of combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons and ammunition should undoubtedly be included in the category of combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons and ammunition referred to in Article 13D of the Armistice Agreement; and believes that the term "combat aircraft" should include aircraft with certain equipment that can be equipped with destructive weapons at any time. However, the US side has not yet abandoned its unreasonable position.

### 美方阴谋破坏停战协定关于替换武器的规定

    美方阴谋破坏停战协定关于替换武器的规定
    【新华社开城四日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面代表团三日发表公报如下：
    朝鲜停战协定第十三款卯项规定，朝鲜停战双方在停战后应停止自朝鲜境外进入增援的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药，在停战期间毁坏耗损的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药，只能在同样性能同样类型的一件换一件的基础上，经由停战协定所规定的口岸，在中立国视察小组的监督与视察下，方得进行替换。但美方近竟一再主张：作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药的零件及拆散件，应不受上述规定的限制。这就是说，美方可以把作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药拆成零件或拆散件运入南朝鲜，在南朝鲜装配成为完整的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药。对于美方此种显然违反停战协定的主张，朝中方面坚决表示反对。
    与此同时，美方近又屡次建议：停战协定第十三款卯项所规定的作战飞机，不应包括有一定设备随时可以装备毁灭性武器的飞机。根据美方的这一建议，美方可以把一架战斗机的枪炮暂时卸下，以所谓“非作战飞机”的名义运入朝鲜；而所卸下的战斗机上的枪、炮，按照美方的前一主张，又可以在零件或拆散件的名义下自由运入朝鲜，然后再装到原来的战斗机上。这样，停战协定第十三款卯项的规定，将成为一纸空文。对于美方这一荒谬建议，朝中方面已坚决予以拒绝。
    根据驻南朝鲜各口岸的中立国视察小组向中立国监察委员会的报告，已多次发现美方没有遵守停战协定第十三款卯项的规定，其所运入南朝鲜的军事物资与它向中立国视察小组所报告者不符。现在美方又想出了上述化整为零，再化零为整的把戏，企图在事实上整个撕毁停战协定第十三款卯项，以便加紧实行武装李承晚伪军的阴谋。
      朝中方面本着严格执行停战协定的精神，坚决主张：作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药的零件与拆散件，毫无疑义地应包括在停战协定第十三款卯项所指的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药的范畴；并认为：作战飞机一词应包括有一定设备随时可以装备毁灭性武器的飞机。但美方迄今尚未放弃其无理立场。
