    “A Strange Factory” Wei Xiang
    As the southbound Yuehan train arrives at the Zhaolizhao station, located where Hunan and Hubei provinces meet, passengers will notice several brand-new red buildings arranged in rows and columns within the desolate valley. Tall chimneys rise into the sky, presenting an impressive sight. The train's loudspeaker announces: "This is a newly built, modern brick tea factory of our country..."
    Not only is this new brick tea factory introduced in this way on the train, but the Hubei Daily also devoted an entire page to it on January 11th of this year. However, the local people are not interested in this brick tea factory; on the contrary, they call it "a strange factory." What is going on?
    The Zhaolizhao Brick Tea Factory was only completed in April of this year. Previously, the tea factory was producing in Yangloudong, which is eight miles away from Zhaolizhao. At that time, the tea factory was quite large, with more than 1,600 workers. In 1951, it produced nearly 200,000 cases of brick tea, and in 1952, it produced 90,000 cases. However, after moving into the new factory this year, the newly installed machines only operated for 40 days before stopping, and most of the 1,600 workers returned home, leaving only 60 workers divided into three shifts to maintain production. The machines have rusted due to prolonged disuse. Why did a new tea factory, which cost more than 12 billion yuan for a single workshop, collapse as soon as it was built? From a conversation with Comrade Li Zhenzhou, the factory director and Party Secretary, we learned that the situation is as follows: Of the nearly 200,000 cases of brick tea produced by the factory in 1951, 90,000 cases are still stockpiled in various places and have not been sold. Of the 90,000 cases of tea produced last year, only 20,000 cases have been sold, and the rest are stockpiled. The Zhaolizhao Brick Tea Factory is currently holding 300,000 dan of old tea leaves and 5,000 cases of brick tea in storage. Based on the annual sales of 10,000 to 20,000 cases of tea, it would take at least ten years to sell off the factory's stockpiled brick tea. The China Tea Corporation is aware of this situation, but the construction of the new Zhaolizhao Brick Tea Factory was decided by the Corporation only after the production and sales situation of brick tea had seriously deteriorated. Before deciding to build the new factory, the Corporation did not send anyone to conduct an on-site survey, but suddenly sent a telegram saying: "Immediately relocate to Zhaolizhao..." As soon as the new factory was completed, the Corporation issued an order to stop producing brick tea and switch to producing green tea and qingcha (oolong tea). The equipment of the Zhaolizhao Brick Tea Factory, from the factory buildings to the machines, is all for making brick tea. To switch to making green tea would render all the original machines useless. Secondly, from technicians to workers, they have been producing brick tea for many years, and now they are suddenly asked to switch to making green tea, which they are not skilled at. Furthermore, the tea farmers in the Yangloudong tea region produce old tea leaves (used for making brick tea). If they switch to making green tea, it will be impossible to purchase raw materials for making green tea within the Yangloudong tea region. Seeing that this approach was not feasible, the Corporation then ordered the tea factory to switch to making "Yin tea" (the method of making Yin tea is to first steam the old tea leaves used for making brick tea in a wooden steamer, then dry them, and then fry them over a strong fire. The finished product of Yin tea is charred black tea chunks and fine powder). After doing this for a short time, we recently heard that the Corporation is preparing to dismantle a green tea factory in Hunan and transport the machines to Zhaolizhao to rebuild the tea factory into a green tea factory. According to Comrade Li Zhenzhou: "Not counting the transportation cost of the machines, the installation cost alone would require 400 to 500 million yuan. After the machines are moved here, there will be no raw materials for making green tea, and there will be no skilled workers, while Hunan has everything. I don't understand what the Corporation is planning?"
    The tea factory has long been shut down. What this factory will do in the future is unknown. What is strange is that the third phase of the factory's construction officially started on August 15th. The construction tasks for the third phase are: to build new dormitories to accommodate 800 workers, a rest room for 800 female workers during their menstrual periods, a sanatorium, a trade union office, an auditorium, etc., and to build a tall wall around the 107,000 square meter factory area.
    Truly a "strange factory"!

### “一个奇怪的工厂”

    “一个奇怪的工厂”卫翔
    当南去的粤汉列车抵达湘鄂两省交界地方的赵李桥站时，旅客们发现在荒凉的山谷中，纵横排列着几座簇新的红楼，高大的烟囱耸入半空，气魄相当雄伟。列车上的广播器介绍说：“这是我国新建的一个新型现代化的砖茶厂……。”
    这个新建的砖茶厂，不仅列车上这样介绍，就连今年一月十一日的湖北日报也曾用了整版的篇幅介绍它。但是当地的群众对于这座砖茶厂，却并不感兴趣，相反地他们喊它是：“一个奇怪的工厂”。这是怎样一回事呢？
    赵李桥砖茶厂今年四月才建成，茶厂以前是在距赵李桥八里路的羊楼洞进行生产。那时茶厂规模相当庞大，有一千六百余工人，一九五一年产砖茶近二十万箱，一九五二年也产砖茶九万箱，但今年迁入新厂后，新装的机器前后仅开动了四十天就停顿了，一千六百多工人大部回家了，只留下六十个工人，分成三班维持生产。机器因为长久不用，都生了锈。一个单厂房就花费了一百二十多亿元的新茶厂，为什么一修起来就垮了呢？从该厂厂长兼党委书记李振周同志的谈话中了解，原来是这样：该厂一九五一年生产的近二十万箱砖茶至今尚有九万箱积存在各地未销出去，去年生产的九万箱茶叶，也只销出了两万箱，其他的都积压起来了。赵李桥砖茶厂现在还压存着三十万担老茶、五千箱砖茶。按照年销一、二万箱茶叶的情况，茶厂积压的砖茶，至少要十年才能销完。这种情况，中国茶业总公司是掌握了的，而赵李桥砖茶厂的新建，是在砖茶产销情况严重恶化以后总公司才决定的。在决定建新厂之前，总公司并未派人来实地勘查，只突然来了一封电报说：“即迁建赵李桥……”。新厂刚刚建成，总公司却又来了个命令停止生产砖茶，改制绿茶青茶。赵李桥砖茶厂的设备，从厂房到机器全是制砖茶用的，改制绿茶，原来的机器就全部作废。其次，厂内从技师到工人，多少年来一直生产砖茶，现在突然要他们改制绿茶，技术生疏。再则，羊楼洞茶区的茶农生产的是老茶（制砖茶用），如果改制绿茶，在羊楼洞茶区内将无法购到制绿茶的原料。总公司见这一着行不通后，于是又叫茶厂改制“引茶”（引茶的制法是把制砖茶的老茶叶先用木橧一蒸，蒸熟以后，烘干、再用烈火炒，引茶的制成品是焦黑的细茶块块和细末子）。作了没多久，最近又听说总公司准备把湖南一个绿茶厂的机器拆运到赵李桥，重新把茶厂改建成一个绿茶厂。据李振周同志谈：“机器的搬运费不算，单装架费就需要四、五亿元，搬来之后这里既没有制绿茶的原料，又没有熟练工人，而在湖南却什么都有，不明白总公司的算盘是咋打的？”
    茶厂早已停工了。今后这个厂究竟作什么不得而知。使人奇怪的是：茶厂第三期修建工程八月十五日正式开工了。第三期工程的修建任务是：要修建容纳八百个工人的新宿舍，八百个女工的例假休息室、疗养室、工会办公室、礼堂等，并且还要围绕着十万零七千余平方公尺的工厂区修筑一道高大的围墙。
    真是一个“奇怪的工厂”！
