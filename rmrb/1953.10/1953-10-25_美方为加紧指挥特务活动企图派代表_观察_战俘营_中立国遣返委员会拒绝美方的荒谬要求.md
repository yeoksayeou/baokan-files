(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 24) The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) replied on the 23rd to the United Nations Command Repatriation Group, rejecting the request made in the Group's letter of the 16th to allow it to send representatives to "observe" the POW camps under the NNRC's supervision. The US side's renewed proposal of this absurd demand is clearly aimed at sending spies into the POW camps to conduct activities, directing the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents to sabotage the explanation work even more frantically.

The NNRC's reply stated: "The Commission has noted that the United Nations Command agrees that it cannot be regarded as a protecting power within the meaning of the Geneva Convention, and that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is not authorized to designate the United Nations Command as the protecting power of prisoners of war belonging to the other side."

The US side stated in its letter to the NNRC: According to Article 12 of the Geneva Convention, it can supervise all activities in the POW camps. The NNRC's reply stated: "The Commission regrets that it cannot accept this argument for the following reasons:

The various responsibilities and obligations assumed by the Commission are stipulated in the agreement reached between the United Nations Command on one side and the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Command on the other. The above-mentioned agreement does not state that the contracting parties intend to act in accordance with Article 12 of the Geneva Convention. Therefore, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission cannot be regarded as the receiving state in the sense mentioned in the above-mentioned article."

The reply continued, "The agreement concluded between your Command and the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Command does not stipulate that at any stage any residual or attributable rights regarding prisoners of war be granted to the former detaining power. The agreement stipulates that after a certain period, there will be no more prisoners of war, but only civilians; with respect to these civilians, neither side's command can be deemed to exercise the functions of a detaining power."

The reply stated: "In this case, Article 12 cannot be applied; according to the provisions of Article 12, if the receiving state fails to implement the provisions of this Convention, the state that originally transferred the prisoners of war has the right to demand the return of the prisoners of war. The agreement establishing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission does not contain this right. If this right is not stipulated, it is difficult to say that the detaining power has any corresponding responsibility. Paragraph 4 of the terms of reference also confirms this situation; Paragraph 4 of the terms of reference stipulates that prisoners of war shall be 'released from the military control and custody of the detaining side.' Paragraph 18 stipulates that the detaining side 'shall not interfere with or influence in any name or manner whatsoever.'"

The reply stated: "The only right possessed by the original detaining power is to send representatives to 'observe the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and its subsidiary bodies, including explanation and visits.' In this regard, the Commission still believes that the daily specific administrative work of the POW camps cannot be regarded as a function of the Commission."

    美方为加紧指挥特务活动企图派代表“观察”战俘营
    中立国遣返委员会拒绝美方的荒谬要求
    【新华社开城二十四日电】中立国遣返委员会二十三日复信给联合国军司令部遣返组，拒绝该组在十六日的去信中提出的关于允许它派遣代表“观察”中立国遣返委员会看管下的战俘营的要求。美方又提出这个荒谬要求，其目的显然是企图派遣特务到战俘营里去进行活动，指挥蒋、李特务更加疯狂地破坏解释工作。
    中立国遣返委员会的复信说：“本委员会已经注意到联合国军司令部同意它不能被认为是日内瓦公约所指的保护国，同时中立国遣返委员会也无权指定联合国军司令部充任属于另一方的战俘的保护国。”
    美方在其给中立国遣返委员会的信中说：根据日内瓦公约第十二条，它可以监督战俘营的全部活动情况。中立国遣返委员会的复信说：“本委员会感到不能接受这个论点，理由如下：
    本委员会所承担的各种责任与义务是联合国军司令部一方和朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军司令部一方达成的协定所规定的。在上述协定中并未说明缔约双方打算遵照日内瓦公约第十二条进行活动。因此，中立国遣返委员会不能被认为是上述条款所说的那样意义的接受国。”
    复信接着说，“你方司令部与朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军司令部之间所缔结的协定并未规定在任何阶段把关于战俘的任何剩余权利或归属权利授与以前的拘留国。该协定规定，经过一定时期以后，就没有战俘了，而只有平民；对于这些平民，双方司令部都不能被认为享有一个拘留国可以行使的职权。”
    复信说：“在这种情况下，第十二条就不能适用了；根据第十二条的规定，若接受国未能实行本公约之规定，则原移送战俘之国有权要求将战俘送还。规定成立中立国遣返委员会的协定中并没有这项权利。如果没有规定这项权利，那就很难说拘留国有任何相应的责任。职权范围第四款也证实了这种情况；职权范围第四款规定，战俘应‘从拘留一方的军事控制与收容下释放出来’。第十八款规定，拘留一方‘不得以任何名义和任何方式加以干涉或加以影响’。”
    复信说：“原拘留一方拥有的唯一权利就是派遣代表‘观察中立国遣返委员会及其附属机构之工作，包括解释和访问’。在这方面，本委员会仍然认为，战俘营的日常具体行政工作不能被认为是委员会的一种工作。”
