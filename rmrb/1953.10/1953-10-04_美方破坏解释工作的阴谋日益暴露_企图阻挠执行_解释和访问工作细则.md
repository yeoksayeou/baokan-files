Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 2nd: Special correspondent Wu Min reports: Observers here are closely watching the increasingly exposed U.S. scheme to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war and undermine the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." This scheme can be seen in the recent U.S. protests and statements regarding explaining repatriation rights to prisoners of war and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Access" passed by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Recent developments in this scheme are evident in a U.S. Information Service report stating that the "United Nations Command" expressed "dissatisfaction" with the two rules: "prisoners of war must accept explanation and be allowed individual visits."

The U.S. demands that "prisoners of war have the right to refuse explanation if they so desire." This demand violates the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and is clearly intended to prevent the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission from exercising its authority. Article 3, Paragraph 8 of the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" states, "...the country to which the prisoners of war belong shall have the freedom and facility to... send representatives, in accordance with the following provisions, to the location where such prisoners of war are held, to explain to all prisoners of war affiliated with that country their rights and to inform them of any matters relating to their return home, in particular, their complete freedom to return home and live a peaceful life."

The reasons for U.S. dissatisfaction are obvious. The U.S. demand that prisoners of war have the right to refuse explanation and that talks be conducted in groups aligns with the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee special agents' scheme to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war. According to over one hundred returning Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, these special agents have been placed in the prisoner of war camps where they were detained.

The purpose of this scheme is to allow the special agents to prevent prisoners of war from hearing explanations under the guise of "refusing explanation." Only allowing prisoners of war to listen to explanations in groups would place them under the surveillance and oppression of Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee special agents, who could constantly obstruct the "explanation" work with irrelevant questions and by creating incidents, wasting time needlessly.

This scheme aims to achieve a "victory" in the "psychological warfare" that U.S. Brigadier General Hamblen spoke of to prevent Korean and Chinese prisoners of war from returning home. Hamblen is the head of the "repatriation" group of the United Nations Command, which is currently more interested in delaying and sabotaging the explanation work than in starting it. United Press International reported that "the United Nations Command announced that it will not begin explaining to prisoners of war tomorrow (October 1st), regardless of whether the Communists begin tomorrow or not." The U.S. military authorities are more concerned with forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to achieve a so-called "psychological victory" for their aggressive plans than with sending their own prisoners of war home.

The U.S. swiftly protested the letters from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission informing prisoners of war of their rights under the "Terms of Reference." This shows the close connection between the U.S. military authorities and the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee special agents in the prisoner of war camps. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has not published the full text of this letter, and the U.S. refuses to disclose their source of information. However, Hansen, a U.S. colonel and advisor to Hamblen, showed reporters a "original letter" and "photocopies of three pages of Chinese documents."

According to U.S. sources, Hansen "refused to say how the United Nations Command obtained the letter." Returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war have testified that U.S. officers told them that Kuomintang special agents would enter the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's custodial area as "interpreters or reporters" in order to maintain contact with the outside world. Because their scheme to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war is about to fail, the U.S. military authorities have openly opposed the explanation work, abandoning their past pleasant rhetoric. The U.S. military authorities have preserved intact in the prisoner of war camps within the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's custodial area all kinds of organizations and groups through which their special agents carry out terrorist rule. The U.S. opposes individual explanations and talks with prisoners of war because they fear that prisoners of war may escape the control of the special agents, even for just a few minutes. The U.S. is even more worried because over one hundred Korean and Chinese prisoners of war have already escaped this control before the explanation work began, expressing their desire for repatriation.

To obstruct the implementation of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Access," the U.S. is now threatening the Indian custodial troops with riots. A United Press International dispatch on September 30th stated: "United Nations Command officers fear that prisoners of war may stage bloody riots like the last demonstration on Koje Island when Indian guards try to force prisoners of war to meet with Communist explanation personnel."

It is well known that in May and June of 1952, when prisoners of war on Koje Island refused to accept the illegal screening that forced them to express their refusal to be repatriated, the U.S. prisoner of war camp commander on Koje Island, Boatner, carried out a bloody massacre of prisoners of war. The prisoner of war camp authorities used more than a division of troops, including Greek, Canadian, and British forces, to massacre prisoners of war under the combined attack of U.S. tanks and flamethrowers, forcing them to accept screening. U.S. chief negotiator Harrison said: "Each prisoner of war was subjected to individual, secret talks by United Nations Command military interviewers." It is said that these blood-stained interviewers questioned prisoners of war "individually" in "secret rooms."

Clark openly ordered the "use of maximum force" against prisoners of war who refused screening or talks. Boatner ordered his troops to "beat them, kick them in their vital areas" if the prisoners of war did not submit.

But the U.S. military authorities have now suddenly changed their tune. They now strongly oppose the explanation representatives conducting "individual explanations and visits" with prisoners of war in the presence of representatives from the five neutral nations. They insist that this will cause intimidation or coercion of the prisoners of war. They now demand that force not be used against those special agents who force prisoners of war to refuse to listen to the explanation. They demand that not all prisoners of war need to listen to the explanation. After carrying out months of bloody massacres against prisoners of war to force them to "refuse repatriation," they now demand that only "one explanation" be allowed.

Observers here point out that the U.S. opposition to the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Access" passed by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is clearly aimed at delaying and obstructing the explanation work that should have started on October 1st. This opposition is merely part of the U.S. scheme to obstruct prisoners of war from exercising their right to repatriation.

### 美方破坏解释工作的阴谋日益暴露  企图阻挠执行“解释和访问工作细则”

    美方破坏解释工作的阴谋日益暴露
    企图阻挠执行“解释和访问工作细则”
    【新华社开城二日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：这里的观察家正密切注意着美方阻挠战俘遣返工作和破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的日益暴露的阴谋。这种阴谋可以从最近美国对于向战俘述说遣返权利以及中立国遣返委员会通过的“解释和访问工作细则”所提出的抗议和声明中看出来。美国新闻处报道说，“联军司令部”对于“战俘必须接受解释以及允许进行个别访问”的两项规则表示“不满”，从这里可以看出这种阴谋的最近发展情况。
    美方要求“战俘有权拒绝接受解释，如果他愿意这样做的话”。这种要求违反了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，显然是想使中立国遣返委员会不能行使它的职权。“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的第三条第八款中说，“……战俘所属国家有自由与便利，……按照下列规定派出代表，前往此项战俘被看管的地点，向一切依附于该所属国家的战俘解释他们的权利，并通知他们任何有关他们回返家乡的事项，特别是他们有回家过和平生活的完全自由。”
    美方所以不满意，理由是很明显的。美方要求战俘有权拒绝接受解释并要求分组进行谈话，正合乎国民党和李承晚特务阻挠战俘遣返的阴谋。据一百多名回来的朝中被俘人员说，这些特务已被安插在拘留他们的战俘营里。
    这种阴谋的目的是企图让特务们以“拒绝解释”的名义阻止战俘们听取解释。只让战俘们分组听取解释，这样就可以把战俘们置于国民党和李承晚特务的监视和压迫之下，这些特务可以不时以不相干的问题和制造事故来阻挠“解释”工作的进行，使时间白白浪费掉。
    这种阴谋是为了要在美国汉布伦准将所说的阻止朝中战俘回家的“心理战”中得到“胜利”。汉布伦是联军司令部“遣返”组组长，这个遣返组目前对拖延和破坏解释工作比对开始进行解释工作更有兴趣。合众社报道说，“联军司令部宣布，它将不在明天（十月一日）开始向战俘进行解释工作，不管共方在明天开始与否。”美方军事当局对于强迫扣留朝中被俘人员为他们的侵略计划取得所谓“心理上的胜利”，比对使他们自己的战俘回家更为关心。
  美方对于中立国遣返委员会根据“职权范围”告诉战俘们他们所享有的权利的信件迅速提出抗议。从这里可以看出美方军事当局和战俘营中的国民党与李承晚特务之间是有着密切联系的。中立国遣返委员会并未公布这个信件的全文，而美方拒绝说明他们的消息来源。但是汉布伦的顾问美国汉森上校曾把一份“原信”和“影印的三页中文文件”拿给记者看。
    据美方的消息说，汉森“拒绝说明联军方面是如何得到这个信件的。”归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员已经证明，美国军官曾告诉他们，国民党特务将作为“译员或记者”进入中立国遣返委员会看管地区，以便和外界保持联系。由于他们阻挠战俘遣返的阴谋即将破产，美方军事当局已公开出面反对解释工作，把他们过去一再发表的动听的言论丢在一边。美方军事当局在中立国遣返委员会看管区战俘营中，把他们的特务施行恐怖统治的各种组织与小组原封不动地保存了下来。美方所以反对向战俘进行个别解释与谈话，是由于担心战俘可能摆脱特务们的控制，即使只是几分钟的时间。由于有一百多名朝中被俘人员在解释工作开始以前就已经摆脱了这种控制，表示希望遣返，美方就更加担心了。
    美方为了阻挠执行“解释和访问工作细则”，现在正用暴动来威胁印度看管军队。合众社九月三十日消息说：“联军军官担心，在印度卫兵要强迫战俘们去会见共方解释人员时，战俘们可能会举行像巨济岛最后一次示威那样的流血暴动。”
    大家知道，在一九五二年五月与六月间，当巨济岛上的战俘拒绝接受迫使他们表示拒绝遣返的非法甄别时，巨济岛上的美方战俘营长官波纳对战俘们进行了血腥的屠杀。战俘营当局用包括希腊、加拿大与英国部队在内共计一师以上的兵力，在美国坦克与火焰喷射器的夹攻下屠杀战俘，强迫他们接受甄别。美国首席谈判代表哈利逊说：“每个战俘都由联军司令部军事谈话人员进行个别的、秘密的谈话。”据说这些双手沾满血迹的谈话人员是在“密室”中“个别”询问战俘的。
    克拉克公开下令对拒绝甄别或谈话的战俘“使用最大程度的武力”。波纳命令他的军队说：如果战俘们不屈服，就“鞭打他们，踢他们的要害地方”。
    但是美国军事当局现在突然改变了腔调。他们现在强烈反对解释代表在五个中立国代表的面前对战俘进行“个别的解释与访问”。他们硬说这样会造成对战俘恫吓或强迫。他们现在要求不得对那些强迫战俘拒绝听取解释的特务使用武力。他们要求不需要所有战俘都能听取解释。他们在对战俘进行了几个月的血腥屠杀以迫使他们“拒绝遣返”之后，现在却要求只准进行“一次解释”。
    这里的观察家指出，美方反对中立国遣返委员会通过的“解释和访问工作细则”，其目的显然是要拖延与阻挠原来应该在十月一日开始的解释工作。这种反对只不过是美方阻挠战俘行使遣返权利的阴谋的一部分罢了。
