    Sternly Stop the Criminal Acts of Some Unscrupulous Merchants Defrauding and Slaughtering Farm Cattle
    ——Summary of Readers' Letters
    Recently, we have received several readers' letters exposing the vile behavior of some unscrupulous private merchants who use deceptive means to purchase and slaughter farm cattle. This situation deserves the attention of local people's governments and farmers.
    Reader Wang Xiangcheng writes: Private businesses in Wuhan City, such as Yumin, Yishun, Limin, and Xinxin, took advantage of the fact that farmers in Zhongxiang and Jingmen counties, Hubei Province, were experiencing livelihood difficulties due to the recent drought. They gathered approximately 2 billion yuan and set up purchasing stations, liaison stations, and transportation stations in the villages of these two counties. Falsely claiming to be commissioned by state-owned slaughterhouses, they purchased farm cattle from farmers on a large scale at low prices through deception. Some local farmers were thus deceived. After acquiring a batch of farm cattle, these unscrupulous merchants hired farmers to transport them at meager wages. It is understood that in July and August alone, they had defrauded farmers of 189 farm cattle. Of these, 15 were slaughtered near the purchasing site, while the remaining 174 were transported to Hankou for slaughter.
    A letter from the Luhe City Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Station in Henan Province states: Our city is a distribution center for livestock in the Central South region, and many cattle merchants come to purchase beef cattle. Some unscrupulous cattle merchants purchase farm cattle in rural areas of neighboring counties and then cripple or blind the cattle, or knock out their teeth to pass them off as old cattle, attempting to deceive the inspection authorities into approving them for sale as beef cattle. Some district and township governments in Biyang, Linru, Yiyang, Queshan, and other counties have not been vigilant against the deceptive practices of these unscrupulous private merchants and have carelessly issued disability certificates. Our station has discovered several such cases. Among them, Zhou Baojun, a cattle dealer from Zhumadian, maimed three yellow oxen in late July and sold them as beef cattle. In early September, after buying a yellow ox and a water buffalo in Xiaodian, Xinyang, he hung the yellow ox on a tree and beat it on the head with bamboo sticks, blinding it. After being discovered by inspectors, he was handed over to the People's Court and sentenced to six months of imprisonment.
    In addition, He Jiasen and other readers from Diandong District, Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, also wrote to reflect that the work of the Wuxian Zhi District People's Government was not serious, allowing cattle dealers to exploit loopholes to slaughter farm cattle.
    Farm cattle are an important means of production in current agricultural production and play a significant role in improving farmers' production. However, these unscrupulous private merchants, in order to seek exorbitant profits, arbitrarily violate government decrees, damage the interests of farmers, and even take advantage of disasters in some areas to purchase farm cattle from farmers at low prices through deception, and use vile means to mutilate them in order to fraudulently obtain approval for slaughter from the inspection authorities. This serious illegal behavior is absolutely intolerable.
    In order to stop the aforementioned vile behavior of some unscrupulous private merchants, local people's governments should do the following: First, they should promptly help poor farmers solve practical difficulties in production and life by mobilizing the masses to help each other or by government loans; at the same time, they should also educate farmers to be vigilant against the deceptive behavior of private merchants, not to be fooled, and to report them. Second, it is necessary to strengthen the education and management of cattle merchants and slaughterers, especially to do a good job in inspecting cattle for slaughter, strictly enforce the regulations prohibiting the slaughter of farm cattle, and block opportunities for unscrupulous private merchants to exploit loopholes. Finally, unscrupulous merchants who violate the law, defraud farmers by slaughtering farm cattle, and refuse to mend their ways despite repeated education, should be punished according to law in order to protect the interests of the people and educate other cattle merchants.

    严正制止某些不法商人骗购和宰杀耕牛的犯罪行为
    ——读者来信综述
    最近我们收到几封读者来信，揭发某些不法私商用欺骗手段购宰耕牛的恶劣行为。这个情况，值得各地人民政府和农民群众提起注意。
    读者王相成来信：武汉市私营裕民、义顺、利民、新新等商号，趁着不久以前湖北省钟祥、荆门两县农民因为天旱感到生计困难，集聚资金约二十亿元，在这两县的乡村设立收购站、联络站、接运站，冒称受国营屠宰厂委托，大规模地廉价骗购农民耕牛。当地有些农户因此被骗上了当。这些不法商人在收购一批耕牛后，就以低微的工资雇用农民运送。据了解，仅七、八两月，他们已骗购了一百八十九条耕牛，其中除了十五条是在收购地附近宰杀的以外，其余一百七十四条都已运往汉口宰杀。
    河南省漯河市畜牧兽医站来信：我市是中南区的牲畜集散地，各地牛商来收购菜牛的很多。有些不法牛商到邻近各县农村中收购耕牛后，就把牛弄跛弄瞎，或打掉牛牙冒充老牛，企图欺骗检验机关，批准作菜牛出售。泌阳、临汝、宜阳、确山等县有些区、乡政府对这些不法私商的欺骗行为未予警惕，竟随便开了残废证明。这类事件，我站已发现好几件。其中驻马店牛贩周保均在七月下旬曾先后残害了三头黄犍牛，充菜牛出卖。九月初他在信阳萧店买来黄牛、水牛各一头后，将黄牛吊在树上，用竹棍在牛头上乱打乱捣，将牛眼打瞎。经检验人员发觉后，已把他送交人民法院，判处有期徒刑六个月。
    此外，江苏省昆山县淀东区读者何嘉森等也来信反映了吴县?直区人民政府工作不认真，使牛贩钻空子宰杀耕牛的情况。
    耕牛是目前农业生产中的一项重要生产工具，对农民提高生产有极大的作用。但是，这些不法私商为了图谋暴利，竟任意违反政府法令，损害农民利益，甚至在某些地区受灾的时候，乘机廉价骗购农民耕牛，并用恶劣手段加以残害，骗取检验机关批准宰杀。这种严重违法行为是绝对不能容忍的。
    为了制止某些不法私商的上述恶劣行为，各地人民政府应该做好以下几件工作。首先，要及时用发动群众互助或由政府贷款等方法，帮助贫困农民解决生产、生活中的实际困难；同时，还应该教育农民对私商的欺骗行为提高警惕，不要上当，并加以检举。其次，要加强对牛商屠贩的教育和管理，特别是要做好检验屠牛的工作，严格执行禁屠耕牛的规定，堵塞不法私商钻空子的机会。最后，对某些违反法令骗宰耕牛，情节恶劣而屡教不改的不法商人，应该依法予以惩罚，以保障人民利益，教育其它牛商。
