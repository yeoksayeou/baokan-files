The experience of Taigu County, Shanxi Province in exceeding the wheat procurement target

Yang Xinghua

This year, Taigu County, Shanxi Province, due to the adoption of correct economic measures and the strengthening of the Party's political and ideological leadership, completed the third quarter's wheat procurement task on time and with overfulfillment.

The county produced a total of 29,450,000 catties of wheat this year. It is estimated that the commodity portion of wheat accounts for about 30% of the total output, of which state procurement accounts for 16%, grain merchants and farmers purchase about 10%, and a portion is stored in the hands of farmers. The county's procurement task for the third quarter was 3 million catties, and by mid-September, more than 3.3 million catties had been procured, and it is estimated that another 1 million catties can be procured.

The county has many good experiences in wheat procurement, the most important of which is to grasp the following links:

First, the needs of the masses were investigated, and the supply of materials was well done. Before the start of procurement, the county conducted investigations in five typical villages and learned that farmers were engaged in topdressing, watering vegetable plots, and preparing to cultivate wheat fields. Farmers urgently needed production materials such as fertilizers, waterwheels, insecticides, and walking plows. In terms of consumer goods, there was an urgent need for summer printed cloth. Subsequently, state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives separately made full preparations for materials. In carrying out the supply work, state-owned commercial departments vigorously relied on the cooperatives. When the supply and marketing cooperatives encountered difficulties in materials, the Taigu branch of the China National Cotton Yarn and Piece Goods Corporation supplied 1,852 bolts of cloth, and the Taigu branch of the China National General Merchandise Corporation supplied 719 dozens of socks and towels and more than 10,000 catties of edible salt. Thus, no difficulties occurred in the supply of materials.

In order to facilitate farmers' purchase of industrial products and sale of wheat, they organized grassroots cooperatives to adopt the method of bringing goods to the countryside and door-to-door procurement. The slogan they put forward was: "Procurement goes wherever supply goes." Therefore, it was very popular among the masses. The masses generally reflected that: selling grain saves carrying, buying goods saves running around, saving labor and being convenient. The Xiaobai Township Grassroots Cooperative brought goods to the countryside for procurement seven times in July and August, selling materials worth 6.37 million yuan and procuring more than 34,000 catties of wheat. By the end of August, the cooperative had procured more than 390,000 catties of wheat, exceeding the procurement target of 250,000 catties by 56%.

The county also conducted education on expanded reproduction for farmers in conjunction with the procurement work. And by using the comparison method, it was explained that expanded reproduction was more profitable than grain storage interest, thereby dispelling farmers' reluctance to sell and enabling farmers to actively sell wheat and purchase production materials. In July and August, farmers purchased more than 10,000 catties of soybean cake and nearly 10,000 catties of fertilizer powder, ferrous sulfate, and black beans. In July and August, the value of production materials and consumer goods supplied to the masses throughout the county reached more than 2.63 billion yuan, accounting for 75% of the total value of wheat procured. The total value of materials supplied to the masses by state-owned commercial departments can exceed the total value of wheat procured.

Second, market management was strengthened, and speculation and profiteering activities of private merchants were restricted and cracked down upon. Before the procurement of wheat, the county, through the Federation of Industry and Commerce, asked private mills and private grain stores to formulate wheat procurement plans, stipulating that the total value of wheat procured by private merchants should not exceed their working capital. Therefore, the number of private merchants purchasing was very small. After the private merchants formulated the plan, the County Grain Bureau signed a contract with the private merchants, and the state unified procurement and unified distribution, and private merchants were not allowed to freely purchase on the market. At the same time, the County People's Government also held two or three meetings of staff members of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and directors of various industries to implement the policy of specialized business, mobilize private merchants to actively participate in the county's materials exchange meetings, and not allow private merchants in other industries to freely change careers and purchase wheat, and two private merchants who purchased wheat at will were taken as typical examples and criticized at the meeting, asking them to resell the purchased wheat to the state to educate other private merchants. In addition, the county also mobilized grassroots cooperative cadres to monitor private merchants. The cadres of the grassroots cooperatives were very serious and responsible in carrying out this task. They stipulated that private merchants could not purchase wheat without government certification documents, and some cooperatives established a reporting system, and when they found that private merchants were purchasing wheat at will, they immediately stopped them. This greatly restricted the illegal activities of private merchants competing to purchase wheat.

Third, in implementing the price policy, the county first paid attention to stabilizing market grain prices. For example, at the beginning of procurement, the listed price was out of line with the market price, and the market price was more than 100 yuan higher than the listed price. The grain department took out a part of the wheat and put it into the market. Only after the grain price in the city was stable, did it start the procurement work in the countryside. Secondly, the implementation of the policy of price differences between urban and rural areas and premium prices for superior grades prompted farmers to sell grain locally, which prevented private merchants from competing for purchases.

Fourth, under the unified leadership of the county party committee, the strength of the Unified Trade Corporation and the cooperatives was unified, and the cooperatives were vigorously relied upon to solve the problems that occurred in procurement in a timely manner. For example, regarding the wheat grade issue, the higher authorities stipulated that it should be divided into three grades and nine levels. The grassroots cooperatives proposed that the masses found it troublesome, and there were not so many warehouses, so it was difficult to implement, but the grain department and the county cooperative insisted on implementing it; later, after research by the County Finance and Economics Committee, it was determined to only implement three grades and cancel nine levels, which greatly facilitated farmers' sale of grain. Another example is that due to the issue of wheat standards, disputes arose between the grain department and the grassroots cooperatives. Under the leadership of the Finance and Economics Committee, the grain department and the supply and marketing cooperatives jointly consulted with farmers in the countryside and reached a consensus before it was resolved. The county also paid attention to increasing transportation prices near the city, and promptly solved the transportation problem. The timely resolution of these problems facilitated the procurement of the cooperatives.

The county recently checked that the shortcomings existing in the wheat procurement work are: the development of wheat procurement work is uneven. Although 16 grassroots cooperatives have overfulfilled the task and 18 cooperatives are close to completing the task, there are still 6 cooperatives that have not completed the task. The investigation and understanding of the needs of wealthy households is not enough. Before and after the wheat harvest, many wealthy households spontaneously purchased 50 rubber-wheeled carts, but the cooperatives did not grasp the partial needs of wealthy farmers. If the cooperatives could grasp and meet this part of the needs of the masses, they could also attract farmers to sell more wheat. The county plans to summarize and promote past experience, focus on lagging areas, investigate and understand the needs of wealthy households, meet their requirements, and mobilize wealthy households to sell wheat in the future.

    山西省太谷县超额完成小麦收购任务的经验
    杨兴华
    山西省太谷县在今年收购小麦的过程中，由于采取了正确的经济措施和加强了党的政治思想领导，按时超额完成了第三季度的小麦收购任务。
    该县今年共生产小麦二千九百四十五万斤，估计小麦商品部分约占总产量的百分之三十，其中国家收购百分之十六，粮商和农民约购买百分之十，还有一部分存在农民手里。该县第三季度收购任务是三百万斤，到九月中旬已收购到三百三十余万斤，估计还可收购百万斤。    
    该县在小麦收购中有很多好的经验，最主要的是掌握以下几个环节：
    第一、调查了群众的需要，做好了物资供应工作。在开始收购前，该县做了五个典型村的调查，了解到农民正从事追肥、浇菜地和准备耕麦地的农事活动，农民很需要肥料、水车、杀虫药剂、步犁等生产资料。在生活资料上，迫切需要夏令花布。随后，国营商业部门和供销合作社即分头作了充分的物资准备。在进行供应工作时，国营商业部门大力依靠了合作社，当供销合作社的物资发生了困难时，中国花纱布公司太谷分公司供给花布一千八百五十二匹，中国百货公司太谷分公司供给袜子、手巾共七百一十九打，食盐一万多斤。这样，使物资供应工作没有发生困难。
    为了便于农民购买工业品和出售小麦，他们组织基层合作社采取了带货下乡、上门收购的办法。他们提出的口号是：“收购到那里，供应到那里。”因此很受群众欢迎。群众普遍反映说：卖粮省得背，买货省得跑，又省劳力，又方便。小白乡基层合作社在七、八两月份曾七次带货下乡收购，共推销物资价值六百三十七万元，收购小麦三万四千多斤。到八月底，该社已收购小麦三十九万多斤，超过收购任务二十五万斤百分之五十六。
    该县结合收购工作，还对农民进行了扩大再生产的教育。并用对比方法，说明扩大再生产比存粮利息大，因而打消了农民的惜售思想，使农民积极出售小麦，购买生产资料。七、八两月份，农民购买豆饼一万多斤，购买肥田粉、黑礬、黑豆等近万斤。全县七、八两月份，供给群众生产资料和生活资料价值达二十六亿三千多万元，占收购小麦的总值百分之七十五。加上国营商业部门供给群众物资的总值可超过收购小麦的总值。
    第二、加强了市场管理，限制和打击了私商的投机倒把活动。在收购小麦前，该县通过工商联合会让私营磨坊和私营粮店订了收购小麦计划，规定私商收购小麦总值不许超出他的流动资金，因此私商收购数字很小。在私商订立计划后，县粮食局就和私商签订了合同，由国家统一收购，统一分配，不允许私商再到市场上自由购买。同时县人民政府还一连召开过两三次工商联合会工作人员和各行业主任会议，贯彻专行专业政策，发动私商积极参加县里举行的物资交流会，不允许其他行业私商随意转业和收购小麦，并将两个随便收购小麦的私商做为典型，在会上进行了批评，让他们把已收购的小麦转售给国家，以教育其他私商。此外，该县还发动了基层合作社干部监视私商。各基层合作社干部在执行这一任务时都很认真负责，他们规定私商没有政府证明文件均不能收购小麦，有些社并建立了报告制度，发现私商随便收购小麦时，立即加以制止。这就大大限制了私商争购小麦的非法活动。
    第三、在贯彻价格政策方面，该县首先注意稳定了市场粮价。例如在开始收购时，牌市价脱节，市价高出牌价一百多元，粮食部门即拿出一部分小麦投入市场，在城市里粮食价格稳定后，才在农村中展开收购工作。其次，贯彻了城乡差价和优级优价政策，促使农民就地卖粮，就防止了私商争购。
    第四、在该县党委统一领导下，统一贸易公司和合作社的力量，并大力依靠合作社，及时解决收购中所发生的问题。如关于小麦等级问题，上级规定分三等九级，基层合作社提出群众嫌麻烦，也没那么多仓库，很难执行，但粮食部门和县社硬要执行；后经县财政经济委员会研究确定只执行三等，取消了九级，大大便利了农民出售粮食。又如因麦子标准问题，粮食部门和基层合作社发生了争执，在经财政经济委员会领导下由粮食部门、供销合作社共同到农村和农民协商取得一致后，才得到解决。该县还注意提高城市附近运输价，及时解决了运输问题。这些问题的及时解决都便利了合作社的收购。
    该县最近检查了收购小麦工作中存在的缺点是：收购小麦工作发展不平衡，虽然有十六个基层合作社超额完成了任务，有十八个社接近完成任务，但还有六个社没有完成任务。对于富裕户的需要调查了解不够，全县在麦收前后不少富裕户自发地购买了五十辆胶皮车，但合作社并没有掌握富裕农民的部分需要，如果合作社能掌握和满足了群众这部分需要，还可以吸引农民出售更多的小麦。该县计划今后要总结和推广过去的经验，突击落后区；调查了解富裕户的需要，满足他们的要求，动员富裕户出售小麦。
