Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: New York - Swedish Foreign Minister Östen Undén issued a statement on the 6th, denouncing the US's malicious attacks on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the "Rules of Procedure Concerning Explanations and Interviews" it formulated.

Undén said: "I am very surprised that the spokesman for the United Nations Command in Korea is spreading this kind of statement through the newspapers. In my judgment, this criticism is unfounded, and its nature will greatly complicate the work of the commission, which is already very difficult in itself." Undén expressed deep regret and surprise at the US-launched attacks against India.

Undén pointed out that the "Rules of Procedure Concerning Explanations and Interviews" formulated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission are "in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Armistice Agreement." He specifically cited the provisions of Article 8 of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," stating that the countries to which the prisoners of war belong "shall have freedom and facilities to explain to all prisoners of war under their allegiance their rights and to inform them of any matters relating to their return home, in particular that they have complete freedom to return home and live a peaceful life."

Undén refuted the US's intentional distortion of the explanation work, saying: "In this regard, everything that people say about 'brainwashing' is completely unfounded."

Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: TASS, Delhi, 6th - Indian newspapers expressed indignation at the provocative activities of US and Syngman Rhee special agents in the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The "Hindustan Times" believes that this activity is an attempt to resume the Korean War. The newspaper emphasized that the recent developments in Panmunjom show that the United Nations needs to study the Korean issue immediately to prevent the situation from deteriorating.

The "Indian Express" believes that this provocative action is an action against peace. The "Hindustan Standard" said that such provocative actions in the Demilitarized Zone have created a threatening situation, which is due to the political maneuvering of the United Nations Command, the South Korean government, and the Kuomintang government of Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: New Delhi - Indian newspapers have reported extensively on the threats and control of prisoners of war by US special agents in the POW camps guarded by Indian troops.

The "Hindustan Times" reported on the 2nd that the prisoners of war handed over to India by the United Nations Command are highly organized, with each leader controlling at least five people, and these leaders are in frequent contact with the United Nations Command. On the night of September 30, Indian sentries saw signals being sent in the POW camp, and the United Nations Command returned the signals. The newspaper commented on the same day: The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the guard forces must strive to give prisoners of war absolute and unfettered freedom of choice, but some prisoners of war are coercing those who disagree with them and preventing them from using their freedom.

The "Times of India" published on the 3rd the materials disclosed by two repatriated POWs from the Korean-Chinese side in Panmunjom about special agents controlling the POW camps, which stated: At present, all POW camps have radios smuggled in, and Syngman Rhee and the United Nations Command frequently give instructions and orders, teaching them to use violence against the Neutral Nations Commission and the Korean-Chinese explanation personnel. American observers and representatives will contact them and give necessary instructions. Even the people who sweep the garbage are liaison officers sent in by the special agents. The POW hospital is the center for issuing instructions, and the Americans have special radios and transmitters in the hospital.

The "Statesman" published on the 1st a telegram from the London "Times" reporter stating that the prisoners of war are undoubtedly being intimidated, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should use its influence to resist such intimidation in order to complete its difficult task of ensuring fairness.

    瑞典外交大臣斥美方诬蔑中立国遣返委员会
    印度报纸斥责美方特务在朝鲜非军事区进行挑衅
    【新华社七日讯】　纽约消息：瑞典外交大臣厄斯顿·恩顿六日发表谈话，斥责美方恶意攻击中立国遣返委员会和它所制订的“解释和访问工作细则”。
    恩顿说：“我感到十分惊奇，在朝鲜的联合国方面的发言人通过报纸散播这种声明。据我的判断，这种批评是没有根据的，而且其性质将使委员会的工作大趋复杂，而委员会工作本身已十分困难。”恩顿对美方所发动的对印度的攻击，表示十分遗憾和惊讶。
    恩顿指出：中立国遣返委员会所制订的“解释和访问工作细则”是“符合停战协定的文字与精神的”。他特别引证了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第八款的规定，说明战俘所属国家“有自由与便利向一切依附于该所属国家的战俘解释他们的权利，并通知他们任何有关他们回返家乡的事项，特别是他们有回家过和平生活的完全自由”。
    恩顿驳斥美方对于解释工作的有意歪曲说：“在这方面，人们关于‘洗脑筋’所说的一切话都是完全没有根据的。”
    【新华社七日讯】　塔斯社德里六日讯：印度报纸对于美国和李承晚特务在朝鲜非军事区的挑衅活动表示愤慨。“印度斯坦时报”认为这种活动是企图恢复朝鲜战争。该报强调说，板门店最近事态的发展，说明了联合国需要立刻研究朝鲜问题，以防情况恶化。
    “印度快报”认为这种挑衅行动是反对和平的行动。“印度斯坦旗报”说，在非军事区的这种挑衅行动已造成了一种威胁重重的局势，这是由于联合国军司令部、南朝鲜政府以及台湾国民党政府玩弄政治手段的缘故。
    【新华社七日讯】　新德里消息：印度报纸纷纷报道在印度部队看管下的战俘营中美方特务对战俘的威胁和控制。
    “印度斯坦时报”二日报道说：联合国军方面交给印度看管的战俘有着高度的组织，每一个头子至少控制五人，这些头子和联合国军司令部经常联系。九月三十日夜印度哨兵看见战俘营中有人打信号，联合国军方面即回信号。该报在同一天发表评论说：中立国遣返委员会和看管部队都要努力使战俘得到绝对和毫无束缚的选择自由，但是战俘中间却有人胁迫那些与自己意见不同的战俘并阻止他们使用自己的自由。
    “印度时报”三日发表已遣返的朝中方面两名战俘在板门店揭发特务控制战俘营的材料，其中表明：目前所有战俘营场都私运进无线电，李承晚和联合国军司令部经常给予指示和命令，教他们用暴力反对中立国委员和朝中方面的解释人员。美国观察员和代表们将和他们联系并给予必要的指示。连打扫垃圾的人也是特务派进去的联络员。战俘医院是发出指示的中心，美国人在医院设有特别收音机和传播机。
    “政治家报”一日刊载伦敦“泰晤士报”记者的电讯说：战俘无疑地受到威吓，中立国遣返委员会要完成其保证公平的困难任务，应该运用其影响以抵制此种威吓。
