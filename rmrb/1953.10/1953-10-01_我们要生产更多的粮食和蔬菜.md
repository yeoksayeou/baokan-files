    We Need to Produce More Grain and Vegetables
    Yin Weichen, Beijing Municipal Agricultural Labor Model
    It has been a full four years since the founding of New China, and it has also been more than four years since the farmers in the suburbs of Beijing were liberated. We organized mutual aid teams in 1950, and in 1952 we transformed into agricultural production cooperatives. Production has truly greatly increased, and the income of the cooperative members has increased by more than 50% compared to when we worked individually. As a result, our lives have become prosperous. My family built five new houses, and everyone has acquired new clothes. Thinking back to the past when I worked as a hired hand for the landlord, suffering the bullying of the local tyrants, and the whole family not having enough to eat or wear, compared to now, how can I not thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao from the bottom of my heart!
    This year is the first year that our country has entered planned economic construction. Our farmers must fully support the country's economic construction. After discussion and approval by the general meeting of all cooperative members: "We will respond to the Communist Party's great call to 'increase production and practice strict economy' with practical actions in doing a good job in the three autumn harvests (autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing) and developing winter production, striving for a general increase in the yield of major crops this year, and at the same time laying the foundation for increased production next year." We must further improve the cooperative's management methods, implement the principle of distribution according to work, improve the labor efficiency of cooperative members; do a good job in the annual distribution plan of harvests, and further consolidate and improve our agricultural production cooperative. We must increase the sown area of ​​grain and vegetables and increase the yield per unit area. This year, we plan to plant 86.6 mu of wheat. Soaking the seeds should be done before sowing; dense planting should be universally implemented in irrigated fields, the ridges should be reduced to six inches, the sowing width should be increased to four inches, and the amount of seeds sown per mu should be appropriately increased by two to three jin. This year, the cooperative's autumn vegetables will increase by 33 mu compared to last year. We have planted 34 mu of Chinese cabbage, and we plan to produce 16,000 jin per mu; among them, there are 5 mu of high-yield land, striving to reach 23,000 jin per mu. In order to make the cabbage high-yielding, we adopt the method of "planting in single ditches and fertilizing in stages," preparing 10,000 jin of fermented soybean residue, 3,000 jin of dried manure, and a large amount of liquid manure as topdressing; we have prepared medicines and machinery for preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests; and we pay attention to irrigation to ensure that the cabbage gets sufficient nutrients and the fields are full of seedlings. We must also seize the time to carry out the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, harvesting and plowing as we go, ensuring that all land suitable for autumn plowing in the cooperative is plowed, deep plowing and fine harrowing are carried out, so that the land can rest and conserve moisture. During the autumn harvest, we must harvest carefully, thresh well, dry well, and store well. Crops such as corn, peanuts, and sweet potatoes must be harvested cleanly, ensuring that nothing is left in the fields. At the same time, we also plan to select excellent varieties (350 jin of "Golden Queen" corn, 300 jin of "811" millet, and 1,000 jin of peanuts) to lay the foundation for increased production next year. As for winter production, the cooperative plans to add 26 warm rooms to increase the production of fine vegetables to supply the needs of the city; we will also use large carts to participate in transportation to increase the cooperative's income. We are not afraid of any difficulties and must fight against all kinds of natural disasters to ensure the completion of the task of increasing grain and vegetable production.
    In addition, every household in our cooperative must be careful and meticulous, starting from the details of life (such as cooking, grinding, raising pigs, etc.), striving to save one or two liang of grain per person per day, which would save more than 3,000 jin of grain for the entire cooperative in one year. We must also educate all cooperative members to cherish public property, prevent damage or loss of agricultural implements and objects, reduce cooperative expenditures, and expand production investment.
    Our country is carrying out planned economic construction; we must do our best to increase grain and vegetable production to support the country's industrialization. We know that only when the country is industrialized can our farmers use tractors to cultivate the land, can we produce more grain and vegetables, and can our lives be further improved. We farmers must follow the Communist Party, follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, and fight to the end for the beautiful and happy future—socialism!

    我们要生产更多的粮食和蔬菜
    北京市农业劳动模范  殷维臣
    新中国成立整整四年了，我们北京郊区的农民也解放了四年多了。我们在一九五○年组织了互助组，到一九五二年转成农业生产合作社，生产真大大地提高了，社员们的收入比单干时增加百分之五十多。因此，我们的生活都富裕起来了。我家盖了五间新房，每人都添置了新衣服。想起过去我给地主扛长活、受尽恶霸的欺侮，全家吃不饱穿不暖的苦日子，比起现在，怎不叫我打心眼里感谢共产党，感谢毛主席呵！
    今年是我们国家进入有计划的经济建设的第一年。我们农民一定全力地来支援祖国的经济建设。我们经全体社员大会讨论通过：“用做好三秋（秋收、秋种、秋耕）工作和开展冬季生产的实际行动，来响应共产党的‘增加生产，厉行节约’的伟大号召，争取今年主要农作物的普遍增产，同时为明年打下增产基础。”我们要进一步改善社内经营管理方法，贯彻以按劳取酬为主的原则，提高社员劳动效率；做好全年收获物的分配方案，进一步巩固提高我们的农业生产合作社。我们要增加粮食及蔬菜的播种面积，提高单位面积产量。今年我们计划种小麦八十六点六亩。播种前要实行浸种；水地普遍施行密植，垄背缩到六寸，播幅加宽到四寸，每亩适当增加播种量二斤到三斤。秋季菜蔬今年全社比去年增加三十三亩。我们种的大白菜三十四亩，计划每亩产量一万六千斤；其中有五亩丰产地，争取每亩达到二万三千斤。为了使白菜丰产，我们采用“单沟栽种，分期施肥”的方法，准备一万斤酱渣子、三千斤粪干和大量稀粪作追肥；准备好了防治病虫害的药械；并且注意灌溉，使白菜得到充足的养分，田间苗满。我们还要抓紧进行秋收、秋耕，熟一块、收一块，收一块、耕一块，全社适宜秋耕的土地普遍进行秋耕，做到深耕细耙，使土地能够歇乏保墒。在秋收进行当中，我们要细收细打，收好、打好、晾好、藏好。如玉米、花生、白薯等要收清刨净，不叫有一点抛撒在地里。同时，我们还计划挑选优良品种（“金黄后”玉米三百五十斤，“八一一”谷三百斤，花生一千斤），为明年打下增产基础。至于冬季生产，社内打算添置暖室二十六间，增加细菜生产，供应城市需要；还要用大车参加运输，增加社内收入。我们不怕任何困难，一定要跟各种自然灾害作斗争，保证完成粮食和蔬菜的增产任务。
    此外，我们社内每户都要精打细算，从生活细节着手（如做饭、推磨、养猪等），争取每人每天节省出一两粮食，全社一年可节省三千多斤粮食。我们还要教育全体社员，爱护公共财物，防止农具物件的损坏或遗失，减少社内开支，扩大生产投资。
    我们国家正在进行有计划的经济建设；我们一定要尽力增产粮食和蔬菜，支援国家的工业化。我们知道，只有国家工业化了，我们农民才能使用拖拉机耕地，才能生产更多的粮食、蔬菜，我们的生活才可能更加提高。我们农民一定要跟着共产党走，朝着毛主席指示的方向走，为美好幸福的远景——社会主义而奋斗到底！
