　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th -- The joint meeting of the People's Chamber and the Senate of the German Democratic Republic was held in the People's Chamber Hall on the afternoon of the 7th to elect the President of the German Democratic Republic. Wilhelm Pieck, the leader of the German working class, at the age of 77, was re-elected and will continue to serve as president.

　　This election was held in accordance with Article 101 of the Constitution of the German Democratic Republic, which states that "The President of the Republic shall be elected every four years by a joint meeting of the People's Chamber and the Senate." The German Democratic Republic was established on October 7, 1949. On October 11, the then Provisional People's Chamber and Provisional Senate held a joint meeting and unanimously elected Pieck as the first president. The president's term has now expired.

　　The People's Chamber Hall was filled with more than 430 members of the People's Chamber and the Senate, as well as representatives of various parties and representatives from West Germany.

　　Also present were the diplomatic envoys of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and various People's Democratic countries.

　　At 2:00 p.m., Jo. Diekmann, Chairman of the People's Chamber, announced the opening of the meeting and briefly explained the re-election of the president in accordance with the Constitution. Then, O. Nuschke, member of the People's Chamber and Deputy Prime Minister, spoke. Amidst warm applause, Nuschke, on behalf of the parliamentary groups of the two chambers, proposed to re-elect Pieck as president. He emphasized the outstanding contributions made by President Wilhelm Pieck to the German Democratic Republic and the entire German people, and called Pieck a tireless fighter for peace and German unity, and for safeguarding the interests of the German people.

　　When Diekmann put this proposal to a vote, all the representatives stood up and unanimously elected Pieck to continue as president.

　　After the election, the Vice-Chairman of the People's Chamber, Matern, and the Chairman of the Senate, Robert Dannenberg, welcomed President Pieck to the hall. Everyone stood up and cheered, with continuous applause. The atmosphere of love and respect for President Pieck permeated the entire hall. Diekmann delivered a welcome speech to President Pieck, saying: "Your re-election shows that not only the working class, but also all the people, express their gratitude for your work in the past four years. The enemies of the German Democratic Republic are trying to intensify their attacks on the new Germany among the masses, but the masses of the people do not want war, do not want permanent division, but want peace, unity, and construction. Therefore, we re-elect you as president to reverse the new and serious crisis of our nation, in order to ensure that this republic, established four years ago, can develop in a democratic and peaceful environment. Please allow me at this moment to express the most sincere wishes of patriots in East and West Germany, who hope that in your new term, they will be able to live in a day when unity is achieved peacefully."

　　President Pieck then took the oath of office. He solemnly read the oath: "I swear: I will dedicate all my strength to work for the happiness of the German people. I will abide by the Constitution and laws of the Republic. I will faithfully perform my duties and treat everyone fairly."

　　President Pieck delivered a speech. He pointed out that for the benefit of the German Democratic Republic, it is necessary to comprehensively and promptly implement the political, economic, and cultural tasks stipulated in the new policy. All the achievements made in industry, agriculture, science, and culture in the past few years must now be used to steadily improve the living standards of all working people.

　　Pieck also pointed out that it is necessary to develop the German Democratic Republic with the assistance of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, so that all peace-loving Germans will regard the German Democratic Republic as an example of a unified and democratic Germany.

　　Pieck emphasized that for the interests of the country, it is necessary to redouble efforts to strive for the unification of Germany into a peace-loving country in a democratic manner. Pieck pointed out that the German people are facing two paths: one is to deepen the division of Germany, engage in economic and military preparations for war, and finally move towards the road of war; the other is to move towards the path of national unity and peace. He emphasized the importance of the Soviet government's note of September 28, which again proposed convening a peace conference to study the German peace treaty, establishing an all-German provisional government, holding free all-German elections, and reducing Germany's financial and economic obligations due to the consequences of the war.

　　Pieck finally announced that the German Democratic Republic is willing to reach an all-German agreement on all issues that contribute to the peaceful and democratic unification of Germany and the conclusion of a just peace treaty.

　　He said: This is my understanding of the fundamental characteristics of our policy. We must victoriously implement this new policy, so that new upsurges occur in all aspects of our republic's economy, culture, and science. We must use all our strength to reunify Germany on a democratic basis and promote the conclusion of a peace treaty with the whole of Germany.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 8th -- According to TASS, Berlin, 7th: The people of Berlin warmly welcomed Wilhelm Pieck's re-election as President of the German Democratic Republic. Nearly 500,000 residents from various districts of Berlin held a celebration rally on Marx-Engels Square. Amidst a storm of cheers, President Wilhelm Pieck ascended the rostrum.

　　At the meeting, Hermann Matern, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of German Socialist Unity Party and Vice-Chairman of the People's Chamber, Otto Nuschke, Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the German Christian Democratic Union, and Peter Canzock, State Secretary and representative of the German Free Democratic Party, delivered congratulatory speeches.

　　Finally, President Pieck delivered a brief speech, thanking the people for their trust in him and wishing the German people further victories in their just and patriotic struggle.

    民主德国人民议院、参议院举行联席会议
    皮克再度当选为民主德国总统
    柏林各区五十万居民举行庆贺集会
    【新华社柏林八日电】德意志民主共和国人民议院及参议院两院联席会议，七日下午在人民议院大厅举行，选举德意志民主共和国总统。德国工人阶级领袖、七十七岁高龄的威廉·皮克再度当选，连任总统。
    这次选举是根据德意志民主共和国宪法第一零一条“共和国总统每四年由人民议院及参议院联席会议选举产生”举行的。一九四九年十月七日，德意志民主共和国成立。十月十一日，当时的临时人民议院及临时参议院举行联席会议，一致选举皮克任首届总统。现在总统任期已经届满。
    人民议院大厅里坐满着人民议院及参议院议员共四百三十余人，以及各党派的列席代表和从西德来的代表。
    到会的还有苏联、中华人民共和国及各人民民主国家的外交使节。
    二时整，人民议院主席约·狄克曼宣布开会，并简短说明根据宪法改选总统。接着由人民议院议员、副总理奥·努舍克讲话。在热烈的掌声中，努舍克代表两院议院各党团提议再度选举皮克为总统。他强调指出威廉·皮克总统对德意志民主共和国及全体德国人民所作的杰出贡献，并称皮克为争取和平与德国统一、保卫德国人民利益的不倦的战士。
    当狄克曼将这个建议提付表决时，全体代表起立，一致选举皮克连任总统。
    选举后，人民议院副主席马特恩和参议院主席罗贝丹兹将皮克总统迎接到大厅里，全体起立欢呼，掌声不停。对皮克总统爱戴的情绪，洋溢在整个大厅中。狄克曼向皮克总统致欢迎词说：“你的再度当选，说明了不仅是工人阶级，而且全体人民对于你在四年当中的工作表示感谢。民主德国的敌人企图在群众当中加强他们对新德国的打击，但是人民群众不要战争，不要永久的分裂，而要和平、统一、建设。因此我们再度选举你为总统，来扭转我们民族的新的严重危机，以保证这个在四年前成立的共和国能够在民主、和平的环境里发展。请让我在这个时刻表达出东西德爱国人士最衷心的愿望，他们希望在你新的任期内，能够生活在一个以和平方式而获得统一的日子里。”
    皮克总统接着宣誓就职，他庄严地宣读了誓词：“我宣誓：我将贡献全力为德国人民的幸福而工作，我定将遵守共和国的宪法和法律，我将忠诚地执行我的职责，并将公正地对待每一个人。”
    皮克总统发表了演说。他指出，为了德意志民主共和国的福利，必须全面地、早日地实现新方针所规定的政治、经济与文化方面的任务。在过去几年中，在工业和农业方面，在科学与文化方面所取得的一切成就，现在都必须运用来稳步提高全体劳动人民的生活水平。
    皮克同时指出，必须在苏联和人民民主国家的援助之下，发展德意志民主共和国，使全体爱好和平的德国人把德意志民主共和国看作统一和民主的德国的范例。
    皮克强调，为了国家的利益，必须加倍努力，争取以民主的方式把德国统一成一个爱好和平的国家。皮克指出：德国人民面临两条道路：一条是加深德国的分裂，从事经济上和军事上的备战，最后走到战争的道路；一条是走向全国统一与和平的道路。他着重指出苏联政府九月二十八日的照会的重要意义，这个照会再次建议召开一个和会来研究对德和约，成立一个全德临时政府和举行全德自由选举，以及减除德国由于战争后果所负担的财政和经济义务。
    皮克最后宣布，德意志民主共和国愿意就所有有助于德国的和平民主的统一以及缔结公正的和约的一切问题达成全德协议。
    他说：这是我对我们政策的根本特点的认识。我们必须胜利地执行这个新方针，使我们共和国的经济、文化和科学各方面出现新的高涨。我们必须拿出全部力量使德国在民主基础上重归统一，并促成与整个德国缔结和约。
   【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社柏林七日讯：柏林人民热烈地欢迎威廉·皮克再度当选为德意志民主共和国总统。来自柏林各区的将近五十万居民在马克思—恩格斯广场上举行了庆祝集会。在暴风雨般的欢呼声中，威廉·皮克总统登上主席台。
    会上，德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员、人民议院副主席赫尔曼·马特恩，副总理、德国基督教民主联盟主席奥托·努舍克，国务秘书、德国自由民主党代表彼得·坎索克都发表了祝贺词。
    最后，皮克总统发表简短的演说，感谢人民对他所表示的信任，并祝德国人民在他们正义的、爱国的斗争中获得更进一步的胜利。
