    Planting Green Manure Can Increase Production and Reduce Costs
    Not long ago, we went to Jiatang Township, Shangyu County, to understand the early rice harvest, and found that most farmers in the township had increased their early rice production to varying degrees, with only a few farmers experiencing a decrease compared to last year. Within a single household's land, some fields increased in production, while others decreased; some fields decreased (or increased) significantly, while others decreased (or increased) only slightly. The reasons for the increase or decrease in production, apart from soil quality, the amount of agricultural investment, and the quality of cultivation techniques, were most closely related to the quality of the clover and alfalfa growth. (Clover and alfalfa are sown into rice paddies every winter and turned into the mud during spring plowing to decompose and serve as base fertilizer.) For example, farmer Lu Songyuan had 2.4 mu of land, and because the clover and alfalfa grew well last year, he harvested 800 jin of dry grain; this year, the clover and alfalfa were only half as good as last year, so he only harvested 600 jin. Another example is farmer Zhou Maoyuan, who had 4.3 mu of land, of which 2 mu were planted with clover and alfalfa last year, and this year each mu yielded 350 jin of rice; the remaining 2.3 mu were not planted with clover and alfalfa, and although other cultivation and fertilization conditions were exactly the same as those 2 mu, each mu only yielded 270 jin. We also investigated the harvest situation of other farmers in more detail, and the conclusions were generally the same. Farmers all say, "A fraction of clover and alfalfa, a fraction of the harvest."
    Good clover and alfalfa growth can also reduce agricultural production costs and increase farmers' actual income. Farmers say that there are two ways to increase yields: one way is the method adopted by some farms now, which is to apply topdressing fertilizer desperately to make the rice grow big, without considering the cost, resulting in some rice lodging and reduced production; even if production is increased, the cost is very high. Farmers say, "We can't use this method of farms, we can't afford it." (This is actually a criticism of the management of some farms.) Another way is to cultivate good clover and alfalfa in winter, twist more river mud or pond mud, and first apply sufficient base fertilizer; after the seedlings are planted, apply 5-6 jin to 7-8 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu (some farmers apply gypsum or alum, 6-7 jin per mu) as auxiliary fertilizer. In this way, excluding the labor cost of planting clover and alfalfa and twisting river mud, the cost is only about 30,000 yuan (10,000 yuan for clover and alfalfa seeds, 10,000 yuan for bone meal to cultivate clover and alfalfa, and 10,000 yuan for topdressing fertilizer after the seedlings are planted). This is much cheaper than the first method.
    Zhejiang Provincial Labor Model Yao Xujiang told us that the agricultural production cooperative he leads planted a total of 120 mu of double-cropping rice this year, of which 37 mu did not have clover and alfalfa, and more than 50,000 yuan of commercial fertilizer was applied per mu, with a yield of only about 300 jin; more than 60 mu had 60-70% clover and alfalfa, and only about 30,000 yuan of commercial fertilizer was applied per mu, but the yield reached 350 jin to 400 jin; the remaining 20 mu had good clover and alfalfa growth, and only about 10,000 yuan of commercial fertilizer was applied per mu, but the yield reached 400 jin to 500 jin.
    Farmer Yang Yuchang grew very good clover and alfalfa last winter. This year, after planting 15.5 mu of early rice seedlings, he applied a total of only 80 jin of gypsum as topdressing fertilizer, with a topdressing fertilizer cost of only more than 2,800 yuan per mu, equivalent to 4 jin of rice. The yield per mu was about 400 jin, and after deducting the topdressing fertilizer cost, there was an income of 396 jin of rice. Farmer Xu Zhixian harvested about 400 jin per mu this year from 5.5 mu of early rice, but his clover and alfalfa were only 40%, so he had to rely on applying a large amount of topdressing fertilizer. A total of 240,000 yuan worth of commercial fertilizers such as cottonseed meal and ammonium sulfate were applied to 5.5 mu of land, with a topdressing fertilizer cost of 43,636 yuan per mu, equivalent to 61 jin of rice, accounting for more than 15% of the yield. After deducting the topdressing fertilizer cost, the actual income per mu was only 339 jin of rice.
    Planting Green Manure Can Improve Soil and Cultivate Fertility
    Clover and alfalfa contain rich organic matter, and their roots have root nodules that can fix nitrogen in the air. In addition, they also contain phosphoric acid and potassium oxide, so the fertilizer effect is great and can improve soil structure. In the past, ordinary farmers generally planted clover and alfalfa in their own cultivated land every year, while poor and lower-middle peasants and some middle peasants rarely planted clover and alfalfa because they cultivated the land of landlords and were always in danger of being taken away, so the land became increasingly infertile and the yield was low and unstable.
    We can also see this fact from the survey of the yield situation of various classes in the rural areas now: two well-to-do middle peasant households planted 27 mu of rice, with a yield of 401 jin per mu, and applied commercial fertilizer worth 5,990 yuan per mu, accounting for 2% of the yield. Five middle peasant households planted 43.56 mu of rice, with a yield of 306 jin per mu, and applied commercial fertilizer worth 11,212 yuan per mu, accounting for 5% of the yield. Five poor peasant households planted 22.91 mu of land, with a yield of 297 jin per mu, and applied commercial fertilizer worth 23,308 yuan per mu, accounting for 11% of the yield; three farmhand households planted 13.66 mu of land, with a yield of 297 jin per mu, and applied commercial fertilizer worth 37,300 yuan per mu, accounting for 17% of the yield. From these surveys, the yield of farmers above the middle peasant level is high, and they do not apply much topdressing fertilizer, because their land has been planted with clover and alfalfa for many years, and the fertility has been well cultivated. What about the land of poor and lower-middle peasants? Before liberation, it belonged to the landlords, and most of it was not planted with clover and alfalfa. After liberation, because life was still difficult, they could not plant clover and alfalfa well, so the fertility was still very infertile. Therefore, they had to simply apply more topdressing fertilizer (supported by state loans) to increase the yield. As a result, the cost is very high, the actual income is reduced, and the fertility cannot be cultivated. From this point of view, if this problem is not effectively solved, it will affect the increase in grain production and the improvement of the lives of poor farmers.
    According to our investigation and understanding, the method of cultivating fertility is: first, to improve water conservancy so that irrigation and drainage are smooth, and second, to cultivate clover and alfalfa year after year. As long as clover and alfalfa are planted for three consecutive years, bad fields can be turned into good ones. Labor model Zhou Yilai (poor peasant) planted 8.63 mu of land, all of which were divided during the land reform. These fields were originally rotated as sacrificial fields, so no one had planted clover and alfalfa in the past. When he planted them for the first year (1951), he only harvested 530 jin per mu for both early and late rice seasons. Later, he carefully cultivated green manure every year, and the soil quality became better year by year. This year, the yield of early rice alone reached more than 400 jin per mu. (Of course, there are other reasons for the increase in production, but his consecutive two years of growing good green manure is the main reason.)
    How to Lead Farmers to Cultivate Green Manure Well
    How to lead farmers to cultivate green manure (clover and alfalfa) well? According to our research with labor models, cadres, and experienced farmers in Jiatang Township, we believe that first, the rural party committees and governments at all levels in areas where farmers are accustomed to planting green manure should strengthen specific leadership and assistance in cultivating clover and alfalfa, and should regard leading the planting of good clover and alfalfa as an important part of leading winter production. Because the cultivation of good clover and alfalfa is mainly in winter, and frost damage is very likely to occur in winter, the clover and alfalfa will be submerged and frozen to death if field management is slightly neglected. In order to do this work well, cooperative departments should do a good job in supplying seeds and fertilizers. Last year, the cooperative departments failed to supply clover and alfalfa seeds, and sold old clover and alfalfa seeds to farmers, with a germination rate of only 50-60%, and some did not germinate at all, wasting labor and money, and the clover and alfalfa grew very poorly, which greatly affected the increase in rice production. Rural work cadres should also lead farmers to do a good job in field management. Last year, in some places, rural work cadres did not lead farmers to dig drainage ditches in clover and alfalfa fields and apply more plant ash to keep warm, but only shouted slogans like "turn winter leisure into winter busy"; as a result, the emergence rate of clover and alfalfa was very low, and the frost damage was quite serious. The National Bank should also consider providing loans to help poor farmers who cannot afford clover and alfalfa seeds and bone meal as much as possible.
    In addition, we should also pay attention to improving the technology of cultivating clover and alfalfa. Although the climate was out of balance last winter and early spring, affecting the growth of clover and alfalfa, many farmers' clover and alfalfa grew very well, and their early rice yield was also high. The main reason is that they have better cultivation technology. For example, where plant ash was applied in time, the degree of frost damage to clover and alfalfa was far less than where it was applied late, so the yield was also higher. In addition, according to the experience of farmers in various places, applying more plant ash, especially more pig manure ash, is also an important part of cultivating good clover and alfalfa. Therefore, we should pay attention to accumulating ash fertilizer from now on. In short, we must attach importance to improving clover and alfalfa cultivation technology as we attach importance to improving rice cultivation technology, and strive for a bumper harvest of clover and alfalfa.

    培育绿肥是增加产量降低成本的好办法
    ——浙江上虞县夹塘乡种植紫云英、苜蓿情况的调查

    种绿肥能增加生产、降低成本
    不久以前，我们到上虞县夹塘乡了解早稻收成情况，发现这个乡大部分农民的早稻在不同程度上都增产了，只有少数农民比去年减产。在一户的土地中，有的田增产了，有的田减产了；有的田减产（或增产）多，有的田减产（或增产）少。增产或减产的原因，除土质好坏、农业投资多少、耕作技术好坏等外，与产量高低关系最密切的是草子长得好坏。（草子即紫云英和苜蓿，每年冬季播入稻田，春耕时翻在泥中使之腐烂，作为基肥。）如农民卢松元有二亩四分田，去年因为草子增产，就收了八百斤燥谷；今年草子只有去年的一半，就只收了六百斤。又如农民周茂元有四亩三分田，其中二亩去年种了草子，今年每亩就收到三百五十斤稻谷；其余二亩三分没有种草子，虽然其他耕作、施肥条件与那二亩完全相同，每亩却只收到二百七十斤。我们又较详细地调查了其它农户的收成情况，所得结论也大体相同。农民们都说：“一分草子，一分年成。”
    草子种得好，还能降低农业生产成本，增加农民的实际收入。农民说：要使产量提得高，有两种办法：一种办法是现在有些农场所采用的办法，为了使得稻大，就拼命施追肥，不计较成本，结果反而施得有些稻倒伏减产；即使增产了，成本也很高。农民说：“农场的这种办法我们用不来，用不起。”（这实际上也是对一些农场经营工作的一种批评）另一种办法就是冬季培育好草子，多捻河泥或塘泥，先打足基肥；等到秧插下后，再施下硫酸錏每亩五、六斤到七、八斤（有的农民施用石膏或明矾，每亩六、七斤）作辅助肥料就行了。这样，种草子、捻河泥的人工不算在内，大约只要成本三万元（草子种子一万元，培育草子用骨粉一万元，秧插下后追肥一万元）。这就比前一种办法省钱多了。
    浙江省劳动模范姚许江告诉我们：他所领导的农业生产合作社，今年共种一百二十亩双季稻，其中三十七亩因为没有草子，每亩追施了五万多元的商品肥料，产量只三百斤左右；另有六十多亩，草子有六、七成，每亩只追施三万元光景的商品肥料，产量却达到三百五十斤到四百斤；再有二十亩草子长得好的，每亩只追施过一万元光景的商品肥料，产量却有四百斤到五百斤。
    农民杨裕昌去年冬天种的草子长得很好，今年十五亩五分早稻秧插下后，一共只施了八十斤石膏的追肥，每亩追肥成本二千八百多元，只合四斤稻谷。每亩产量为四百斤光景，减去追肥成本，就有三百九十六斤稻谷的收入。农民徐芝仙今年种五亩五分早稻，每亩也收到四百斤光景，但是他的草子只四成，因此只好依靠施用大量追肥，五亩五分田一共施了二十四万元棉仁粉、硫酸錏等商品肥料，每亩追肥成本合四万三千六百三十六元，折稻谷六十一斤，占到产量的百分之十五强。减去追肥成本，每亩实际所得只三百三十九斤稻谷。
    种绿肥能改良土壤、培养地力
    草子含有丰富的有机质，它的根部并有根瘤菌能固定空气中的氮素，此外也含有磷酸、氧化钾，因此肥效很大，并能改良土壤结构。过去，一般农民的自耕田历年都种草子，而贫雇农和部分中农，因为种的是地主的田，每年都有被抽走的危险，因此一般都很少种草子，土地日益瘦薄，产量低而不稳定。
    我们从调查现在农村中各阶层的产量情况中，也可以看到这一事实：富裕中农两户，种稻二十七亩，每亩产量四百零一斤，每亩追施商品肥料值五千九百九十元，占产量的百分之二。中农五户，种稻四十三点五六亩，每亩产量三百零六斤，每亩追施了一万一千二百一十二元的商品肥料，占产量的百分之五。贫农五户，种田二十二点九一亩，每亩产量二百九十七斤，每亩追施了二万三千三百零八元的商品肥料，占产量的百分之十一；雇农三户，种田十三点六六亩，每亩产量二百九十七斤，每亩追施了三万七千三百元的商品肥料，占产量的百分之十七。从这些调查中看，中农以上成分的农民产量高，而他们所施的追肥并不多，原因是他们的地里历年都种了草子，地力培养得好。贫雇农的田呢？解放前是地主的，大部分没有种草子，解放后因为生活还有困难，未能好好地种草子，因此地力还很瘦薄。于是，就只好单纯多施追肥（由国家贷款支持）来提高产量。因此，成本就很高，实际收入就减少了，也不能培养地力。从这里看：如不切实解决这个问题，就会影响粮食增产和贫困农民生活的改善。
    据我们的调查了解，培养地力的方法：首先是修好水利，使灌溉、排水畅通，其次就是连年栽培草子。只要连续三年种草子，就能把坏田变好。劳动模范周义来（贫农）种了八亩六分三厘田，都是土地改革时分进来的。这些田本来是轮种祭祀田，因此过去没有人种过草子。他第一年（一九五一年）种时，早晚稻两季加起来每亩只收到五百三十斤，后来他每年精心培育好绿肥，土质一年比一年好起来，今年产量早稻一季每亩就收到了四百斤以上。（增产当然还有其它原因，但他接连两年都种好了绿肥是主要的原因）。
    怎样领导农民把绿肥培育好
    怎样领导农民培育好绿肥（草子）呢？根据我们在夹塘乡与劳动模范、干部及有经验的农民研究结果，认为首先是要农民有种绿肥习惯地区的农村各级党委、政府加强对培育草子的具体领导和帮助，要把领导种好草子，作为领导冬季生产的重要内容。因为培育好草子主要在冬季，而在冬季又很易发生霜冻，田间管理稍有疏忽，草子就会淹冻而死。为了作好这一工作，合作社部门应作好种籽及肥料的供应工作。去年合作社部门对于草子种子供应不上，拿陈草子种卖给农民，发芽率只占百分之五、六十，有的全部不发芽，劳民伤财，草子长得极坏，大大影响了水稻增产。农村工作干部还要领导农民作好田间管理工作，去年有的地方，农村工作干部没有领导农民在草子田掘通排水沟，多施草木灰保暖，只是干叫“变冬闲为冬忙”；结果，草子出苗率很低，受冻相当严重。国家银行对于买不起草子种和骨粉的贫困农民，也应考虑尽可能贷款给予扶助。
    此外，还要注意改进栽培草子的技术。去年冬季和今年初春，虽然气候失调，影响了草子的生长，但是也有不少农民的草子长得很好，因而早稻产量也高。主要原因，就是他们有较好的培育技术。如凡是草木灰施得及时的，草子受冻程度就远比施得迟的轻，因而产量也高。另外，根据各地农民经验，多壅草木灰，特别是多壅猪粪灰，也是培育好草子的重要一环。因此应从现在起就注意积灰肥。总之，我们要像重视改进水稻栽培技术一样重视改进草子栽培技术，争取草子丰产。
