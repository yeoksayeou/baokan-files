(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 14th) Today, reporters from the Korean and Chinese side and reporters from the U.S. side observed the explanation facilities built by the U.S. side in Dongchang-ri and the explanation facilities built by the Korean and Chinese side in Songgok-ri.

The impression the reporters got from observing the explanation facilities in Dongchang-ri was: The U.S. side clearly adopted a perfunctory and irresponsible attitude towards the construction. The floor of the explanation tent was made of wooden boards, the top was made of cloth, and the surroundings were made of lead skin and leaky screens. Inside the tent, one could feel the cold wind of early winter seeping in through the cracks. Outside these tents, there was a wire fence that was not even as tall as a person. The tents for prisoners of war awaiting explanation were even more crude, with only wooden boards laid under the tent, and cloth all around and on top. The wind often blew the cloth tent walls inward or outward.

Even with such crude explanation facilities, the U.S. side initially said it would take six to eight weeks to build, and later said it would take at least twenty to thirty days. In fact, as the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has repeatedly pointed out, if the Korean and Chinese side were allowed to build, it could be completed within four days, and it could be built very well. The U.S. side was only compelled to hastily build them after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission repeatedly urged them and world opinion condemned their delay in building the explanation facilities.

The explanation site in Songgok-ri, which our side built in two days, is completely different from the one built by the U.S. side in Dongchang-ri. The explanation site built by our side is not only solid and practical but also very beautiful. When reporters from both sides entered to visit, one U.S. reporter grabbed the tent with one hand, touching the cloth of the tent, trying to compare the quality with American-made tents. But to the surprise of this American reporter, the tent turned out to be a beautiful wooden house. Upon entering the house, one immediately felt warm and comfortable. The top, bottom, and all four walls of the house were made of wooden boards. There were eight bright glass windows on the left and right walls and on the front and rear doors. The room was furnished with tables, chairs, and benches. The U.S. reporter, who wanted to find fault with the explanation site built by our side in Songgok-ri, seemed to feel embarrassed for their authorities.

The U.S. side once nitpicked that the explanation facilities built by our side did not have toilets, but our side built them according to the U.S. side's design drawings, which originally did not require the construction of toilet facilities. This nitpicking by the U.S. side was obviously an attempt to confuse people at the time and cover up its unreasonable behavior in delaying the construction of explanation facilities. But despite this, our side has now also set up toilets in accordance with the new requirements put forward by the U.S. side.

With the consent of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, reporters from both sides today took photos and news films of the explanation facilities in Dongchang-ri and Songgok-ri.

### 美方一再拖延的解释设备修得非常简陋进一步暴露了美方破坏解释工作的阴谋

    美方一再拖延的解释设备修得非常简陋
    进一步暴露了美方破坏解释工作的阴谋
    【新华社开城十四日电】今天朝中方面记者和美方记者观察了东场里美方修建的解释设备和松谷里朝中方面修建的解释设备。
    记者观察东场里解释设备所得到的印象是：美方对修建明显地采取了敷衍塞责的态度。解释帐篷的地下是木板，顶是布的，周围是铅皮和漏风的纱窗，在帐篷里可以感到初冬的冷风从缝隙中侵袭进来。在这些帐篷外，围着一道没有人高的铁丝网。等待解释的战俘的帐篷更加简陋，只是在帐篷底下铺了木板，四周和顶都是布的，风常常把布质的帐篷壁吹得凹进来或者凸出去。
    就是这样简陋的解释设备，美方一开始说要六个到八个星期才能修成，后来又说至少要二十天和三十天才能修成。其实，正如中立国遣返委员会所一再提出的，如果让朝中方面来修，四天内就可以完成，而且可以建造得很好。美方只是在中立国遣返委员会再三催促和世界舆论对它拖延修建解释设备的谴责下，才不得不草草修起了事。
    我方在两天之内修成的松谷里解释场所与美方在东场里所修建的完全不同。我方修建的解释场所既坚固实用，又十分美观。双方记者进入参观时，有一个美方记者一手抓着帐篷，摸摸帐篷的布质，想和美国制造的帐篷比较优劣，可是出乎这个美国记者意料之外，帐篷下却是一座漂亮的木质房屋，一进屋便使人感到温暖舒适，屋的上下和四壁全是木板，左右两壁和前后门上共有八扇明亮的玻璃窗，室内陈列着桌椅和板凳。想从松谷里我方修建的解释场所找点什么岔子的美方记者也似乎替他们的当局感到了难堪。
    美方曾挑剔说我方修建的解释设备没有厕所，但是我方是根据美方设计图样修建的，图样上原来就没有要求修厕所设备。美方的这种挑剔显然是企图在当时混淆人们的耳目，掩盖它拖延修建解释设备的无理行为。但尽管这样，我方现在也已按照美方提出的新要求，设置了厕所。
    双方记者得到中立国遣返委员会的同意，今天都对东场里和松谷里的解释设备照了照片和新闻影片。
