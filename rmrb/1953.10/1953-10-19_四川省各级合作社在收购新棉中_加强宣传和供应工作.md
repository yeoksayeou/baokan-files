Since September, cotton in various parts of Sichuan Province has entered the peak harvest season, and cotton farmers are actively selling new cotton. During the purchasing process, cooperatives have strengthened their publicity and supply efforts. The Hefeng purchasing station in Jianyang County organized cooperative directors, supervisors, and member representatives to educate cotton farmers on picking, ginning, and delivering cotton in batches. The Hengshan purchasing station in Suining County addressed cotton farmers' concerns about grading during the purchase by promoting the state's price policy. Currently, cooperatives throughout the region have more than 300 trained graders. While purchasing cotton, cooperatives in various regions are also supplying farmers with large quantities of means of production and daily necessities. In Jintang County's cotton-producing areas alone, the turnover of five cooperatives in the first half of September exceeded the total turnover for the entire month of August.

    四川省各级合作社在收购新棉中
    加强宣传和供应工作
    自九月份起，四川省各地棉花进入了大收季节，棉农纷纷出售新棉。在收购中，合作社加强了宣传和供应工作。简阳县禾丰收购站组织合作社的理事、监事和社员代表，教育棉农分批拣花、轧花、放花。遂寗县横山收购站针对棉农对收购中验级的思想顾虑，向棉农宣传国家的价格政策。现各地合作社受过训练的验级人员已有三百多名。与收购棉花同时，各地合作社又大量供应给农民生产资料和生活资料。仅金堂县产棉区五个合作社九月份上半月的营业额就超过了八月份全月的营业额。
