Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th. The Korean and Chinese side issued the following statement at the Military Armistice Commission meeting on October 7th:

    Prior to the signing of the Armistice Agreement, your chief representative, General Harrison, made a firm guarantee that the United Nations Command, including South Korea, was prepared to fulfill all provisions of the Armistice Agreement, and that all prisoners of war not directly repatriated by our side would be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in accordance with the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission"; your side also guaranteed that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the personnel sent by our side to work in the camps for prisoners of war not directly repatriated by our side would be protected and given facilities in their work. Since your commander-in-chief signed the Armistice Agreement, your side has an inescapable responsibility to fulfill all the guarantees your side has made and to abide by every provision of the Armistice Agreement, including the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission."

    However, your side has not only failed to provide the facilities needed for the work of the Commission but, on the contrary, has been using every possible means to sabotage the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The "Terms of Reference" stipulate that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission shall immediately make arrangements so that the countries to which the prisoners of war belong have the freedom and convenience to explain to the prisoners of war. Within ninety days from the date of takeover by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, these countries shall send representatives to the locations where these prisoners of war are being held to explain their rights to all prisoners of war who are attached to the countries to which they belong. For this purpose, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission requested both sides to construct explanation facilities in the camps in accordance with the locations and styles recommended by the other side's explanation representatives. Our side, in accordance with the requirements of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, has rebuilt the explanation facilities in accordance with the specific provisions put forward by your side. However, on the other hand, your side has disregarded the repeated and firm demands of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and has fabricated many excuses that are inconsistent with the facts and seriously violate the Armistice Agreement, and has not yet constructed the explanation facilities in accordance with the locations and styles recommended by our side. In addition, your side has openly expressed its unwillingness to make any promises and has put forward a completely unreasonable provisional deadline for the construction of the explanation facilities, thereby attempting to indefinitely delay the construction work and completely sabotage the explanation work. Our side now lodges a strong protest against this action of your side, which seriously violates the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" of the Armistice Agreement. Our side has requested the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to immediately take measures and assume responsibility to quickly resolve the problem of constructing explanation facilities.

    Furthermore, our side will provide the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission with all necessary assistance in accordance with Article 18 of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." However, your side must bear full responsibility for obstructing the explanation work and sabotaging the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission."

   The Neutral Nations Repatriaion Commission has the responsibility to ensure that the representatives of the countries to which the prisoners of war belong shall have the right to explain to the prisoners of war for ninety days, and the prisoners of war shall have the right to listen to explanations for ninety days. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has recommended that, since the start date of the explanation work has been delayed due to your side's arbitrary delaying tactics, the explanation time should be extended accordingly to compensate. However, your side is once again attempting to oppose the extension of the explanation time, thereby hindering the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission from carrying out the work and tasks stipulated in the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." It must be pointed out that the responsibility for delaying the explanation work lies entirely with your side, so your side has no reason to oppose the extension of the explanation time. The duties and responsibilities of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission stipulated in the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" cannot be changed due to your side's deliberate obstruction.

    The "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" stipulate that prisoners of war should be completely free from the control and influence of the detaining side and stipulate that the detaining side has the responsibility to maintain and guarantee the security and order of the area surrounding the prisoner-of-war camp and to prevent and control any disturbance and encroachment on the prisoner-of-war camp by any armed forces (including irregular armed forces) in the area under the jurisdiction of the detaining side. However, your side has sent a large number of special agents to sneak into the prisoner-of-war camps, and through the so-called administrative personnel provided by your side, and using the area controlled by your side, continues to maintain contact with these special agents, constantly organizes activities to sabotage the supervision work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and continues to use violence to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war.

    Your South Korean government has gone even further, openly clamoring that it will attack the Indian guard troops of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in the hope of once again creating the infamous so-called "mass escape" in order to kidnap the prisoners of war and implement your side's conspiracy to forcibly detain the prisoners of war, thereby once again sabotaging the Armistice Agreement. Our side now solemnly warns your side that all these sabotage activities of your side will have serious consequences. Your side must immediately cease all these sabotage activities and guarantee that they will not recur. Your side must bear full responsibility for all the consequences caused by all these sabotage activities of your side.

    在军事停战委员会会议上
    我方强硬抗议美方破坏解释工作
    并郑重警告美方必须停止各种破坏活动
    【新华社开城七日电】十月七日，军事停战委员会会议上，朝中方面发表声明如下：
    在停战协定签字以前，你方首席代表哈利逊将军提出确实保证说：联军方面，包括南朝鲜在内，准备履行停战协定各项条款，所有我方不直接遣返的被俘人员将按照“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”交给中立国遣返委员会；你方并保证说：中立国遣返委员会和我方派往我方不直接遣返被俘人员看管营场工作的人员都将受到保护，并给以他们工作上的便利。自从你方的总司令在停战协定上签字以后，你方就有无可逃避的责任来履行你方提出的一切保证，并遵守停战协定的每项条款，包括“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”在内。
    但是，你方不仅没有提供委员会工作所需要的便利，相反地，一直在使用一切可能的方法破坏中立国遣返委员会的工作。“职权范围”内规定：中立国遣返委员会应立即进行安排，使战俘所属国家有自由与便利来向战俘进行解释。从中立国遣返委员会接管之日起的九十天内，这些国家应派出代表，前往此项战俘被看管地点，向一切依附于该所属国家的战俘解释他们的权利。为了这个目的，中立国遣返委员会要求双方按照对方解释代表建议的地点和式样在看管营场内建造解释场所。我方依照中立国遣返委员会的要求，已经按照你方提出的具体规定把解释场所重新建造。但是，另一方面，你方却把中立国遣返委员会屡次提出的坚决要求置之不顾，并捏造了许多不符事实和严重地违背停战协定的藉口，直到现在还没有依照我方建议的地点和式样建造解释场所。此外，你方公然表示不愿有所许诺，而且提出了一个完全不合理的关于建造解释场所的假定时限，从而企图无限期地拖延建造工作，彻底破坏解释工作。我方现在对你方这种行动提出强硬抗议，这种行动严重地破坏了停战协定的“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”。我方已经要求中立国遣返委员会立刻采取措施，并负起责任以迅速解决建造解释场所的问题。
    此外，我方将根据“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第十八款提供中立国遣返委员会一切必要的协助。但是，你方必须负担阻挠解释工作与破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的完全责任。
    中立国遣返委员会有责任保证战俘所属国家的代表应有权对战俘进行九十天的解释，战俘应有权听取九十天的解释。中立国遣返委员会业已建议，由于你方蛮横的拖延行动、使解释工作开始日期延迟，所以应该相应地延长解释时间，以资补偿。但是你方再度企图反对延长解释时间，借以阻挠中立国遣返委员会执行“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”规定的工作与任务。必须指出，延迟解释工作的责任完全在于你方，所以你方没有任何理由反对延长解释时间。“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”规定的中立国遣返委员会的职务与责任决不能由于你方的故意阻挠而加以改变。
    “中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”中规定：战俘应该完全不受拘留一方的控制与影响，并规定拘留一方有责任维持和保证战俘看管地点周围区域的治安和秩序，并防止和控制拘留一方管辖地区的任何武装力量（包括非正规的武装力量）对战俘看管地点的任何扰乱和侵犯的行动。但是你方派遣大批特务潜入战俘看管地点，通过你方提供的所谓行政人员，并利用你方控制的地区，继续与这些特务保持联系，不断组织活动以破坏中立国遣返委员会的看管工作，并继续以暴力行动阻挠战俘遣返。
    你方的南朝鲜政府更进一步公开叫嚣说，它要攻击中立国遣返委员会的印度看管部队，以期再度制造声名狼藉的所谓“大规模脱逃”以便架走战俘，并实行你方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，从而再度破坏停战协定。我方现在郑重警告你方，你方所有这些破坏活动将造成严重的后果。你方必须立即停止所有这些破坏活动，并保证不再重新发生。你方必须对你方所有这些破坏活动所造成的一切后果负完全的责任。
