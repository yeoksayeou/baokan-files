    Strive to Popularize Classical Literature
    Zheng Zhenduo
    Classical literary works seem very far from us, but in reality, they are very close; they seem to have little connection with our creation, but in fact, they are interconnected by blood and breathe the same air. There are countless connections between us and classical literature.

    A poet is not someone who falls from the sky; he grows up on the land of China, absorbing the excellent poetic nourishment of the Chinese people throughout the ages. He is a poet, but he cannot be completely separated from the land, the people, and the revolutionary struggles of China, nor can he be separated from the influence of the excellent traditions of Chinese poetry. Otherwise, he is not a Chinese poet. It is impossible to imagine that a Chinese poet would know nothing about and absorb nothing from the excellent traditions of Chinese poetry. The excellent tradition of Chinese poetry has a continuous history of more than 2,500 years, and has produced not just a few, or dozens, but thousands of great poets.

    This is just one example. As a Chinese novelist, playwright, essayist, etc., it is also impossible to disregard China's long and excellent traditions. "Song and Yuan Stories," "Water Margin," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Dream of the Red Chamber," and Yuan Dynasty zaju plays, and Ming Dynasty chuanqi plays, are all beneficial and useful to us.

    At the same time, the broad masses of people are happy to see and hear ancient dramas, novels, poems, etc. that have been widely circulated for a long time. Very old dramas, like "The Story of Herding Sheep,"'s "Longing for Home," "The Story of the Golden Seal"'s "Handing Over the Seal, Tattooing Characters," "The Story of the Jade Hairpin"'s "Autumn River," very old novels, like "Water Margin," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," etc., and very old poems, like "The Peacock Flies Southeast," "Ballad of Mulan," "Mountain Songs," etc., are all old but still fresh and lively; they live in the hearts of the people and also live on the lips of the people. The broad masses of people urgently need to read and enjoy the best and most beneficial classical literary heritage.

    But the problem arises: In the vast ocean of ancient literary works of all kinds, what works can be considered classical literary works? What works belong to the excellent classical literary tradition?

    We can say with certainty that not all ancient literary works of all kinds, or thread-bound books printed decades or centuries ago, are all classical literary works or belong to the excellent literary tradition.

    The name classical literature or works of excellent literary tradition itself contains the meaning of good, vital, healthy, beneficial, and useful to us. The so-called classical literature is not only because it is the work of writers of a relatively ancient era, but more importantly, because it has great immortal popular character, is an immortal realistic work, and has immortal artistic achievements, so it can still be alive to this day, and is still welcomed and enjoyed by the broad masses of people.

    The so-called classical literary heritage refers to those works with immortal popular character and realism that are still welcomed and enjoyed by the broad masses of people. They truly and profoundly reflect the social contradictions of the time, express the joys, sorrows, and anger of the people, and tell the broad masses of people what they hope for, what they pray for, what they oppose, or what they hate. They must be from the pen of great writers, those great writers who have deep literary cultivation, who, as Comrade Zhou Yang said, "reach an astonishing degree of accuracy and refinement in artistic skills," and are complete works without flaws. For example, poetry, the rhythm must be as clear as pearls falling on a jade plate, the sound of gold and jade when thrown to the ground, the emotion must be as turbulent as the Yangtze River, and the imagination and rhetoric must be as fresh and green as lotus leaves rolling in the clear dew of a summer morning, and at the same time, the theme sung must be in the same pulse and breathe the same air as the people of the time.

    At the same time, their portrayal of Chinese people's history is the most authentic and vivid, with extremely rich and accurate historical value. Some important historical evidence may not be found in many history books. To understand ancient life, it is impossible to leave out "The Book of Songs." The best and most authentic descriptions and records of social contradictions and people's sufferings in the Tang Dynasty exist in the poetry collections of great poets such as Du Fu and Bai Juyi. Is there a history book that writes more vividly about "officials forcing the people to rebel," the so-called "forced to go to Liangshan," than "Water Margin"? There, the people's struggle experiences and their heroic deeds are moving and useful. That series of people's struggle history is inextricably linked to today's struggle. The broad masses of people need to know more about the vivid struggle history of the past, the heroic deeds of the people's heroes, and need to understand more about the sharp social contradictions of the past; that is to say, the broad masses of people need to read a large number of classical literary works.

    There are many such classical literary heritages in the continuous literary history of more than 2,000 years, which are countless. We cannot help but be proud of our rich classical literary heritage. We have to thank the many great writers of the past for leaving us so many rich and immortal works.

    But the problem arises again: How shall we popularize such a rich classical literary heritage? How shall we make them more beneficial and useful to us? The important task of classical literature researchers lies here.

    Classical literature researchers must use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought shines like the sun in the sky; all ancient works placed under this bright light will be seen more clearly and correctly, will not be deformed, and will not be qualitatively changed. What was originally distorted and misguided by ancient criticisms and annotations will now be completely cleared of fog and the truth will be revealed. What is a classical work, what is a work of the excellent tradition of classical literature, and what is not, will be known at a glance and identified at first sight. Research work under the guidance of this universal truth will wash away a lot of dust from classical works, making them shine brightly, and will also expose the ugly faces of those counterfeit and boring works, leaving them with nowhere to hide. Here, the fact of studying a work or a writer in isolation, or studying the history of literature in isolation, will no longer exist. Literary creation cannot be separated from the economic base, the influence of the times, and social contradictions. A great classical writer or a great classical work must have an extremely keen sense of the social contradictions of the time and dare to reveal these contradictions and describe them vividly. The so-called realistic works, whether they use the exaggerated and imaginative writing of "Journey to the West," "Investiture of the Gods," or "Flowers in the Mirror," or the realistic writing of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Water Margin," "Dream of the Red Chamber," or "The Scholars," the main point is to dare to expose, reveal, and even resist and attack the darkness and cruelty of the ruling class at the time, that is, to describe the profound social contradictions of the time. A great writer must be full of a sense of justice and sympathize with the sufferings of the people.

    In the vast land of classical literary heritage, there are still many things that have not been discovered by people in the past. In particular, local opera scripts, folk songs, and other stories and legends circulating in various places (copied, printed, or circulating in the mouths of the people) still need to be collected and整理 in large quantities. This must be paid attention to. But this does not mean that we should not pay attention to those most easily available, most easily seen, and most popular works. The most popular works have their own reasons for being popular. It is not accidental or fortunate to be loved by the broad masses of people for thousands of generations. Like "Water Margin" and "Romance of the West Chamber," which are welcomed and enjoyed by the broad masses of people, although they have been banned and burned by the ruling class and so-called "defenders of morality," they cannot be banned or burned completely.

    How to popularize those most popular or newly discovered classical literary heritages? How to enable the broad masses of people to appreciate them? Some classical literature is too far away in time, and its "language" itself has created some obstacles. It is not easy for modern readers to understand without clear and understandable annotations (like "The Book of Songs" and "The Songs of Chu"), or there are many "dialects," "jargon," "historical allusions," etc. that must be explained to be understood. This is a very specific problem. In order to prevent most people from wasting energy searching for the difficult meanings of classical works, a relatively small number of people, specialized classical literature researchers, have the responsibility to spend more time and effort to clear away the "language barriers" of classical works and other obstacles that make it difficult for the broad masses of readers to read. Doing this popularization work well is not an easy task. In the past, there have been many books with annotations, like "The Book of Songs," which has had no less than a thousand "annotators" throughout the ages, and "The Songs of Chu" has also had no less than a hundred different annotated editions. Some are still very useful to us, but some are very confused and nonsense, making people more and more confused the more they read. The places that most need annotation are not annotated or are annotated in a confused way, but the places that do not need explanation are annotated a lot. Also, annotating "Romance of the West Chamber" and "Water Margin" like Jin Shengtan, interspersing narration and commentary, and dissecting them piece by piece, creates obstacles for the reader. There, there is too much Jin Shengtan and too little Wang Shifu and Shi Nai'an. Practices like the so-called "Redology," which makes far-fetched connections and goes around in circles to do allegorical work, are really "pitifully useless and wasteful of energy." It is better to put aside all annotations and look directly at the text, which will allow for a deeper understanding and comprehension. But this is for experts with cultivation, not for general readers. The broad masses of creators and the broad masses of readers urgently need simple and understandable and correct annotated editions. They must not be allowed to get lost in the dense fog of confusing and difficult annotations again. There must be a "definitive edition" that will dispel the dense fog when the dawn breaks. Therefore, doing a good job of annotating the classical literary heritage is a long-term undertaking that all classical literature researchers must devote themselves to wholeheartedly.

    To do a good job of annotation, we must first widely collect different editions and read many annotated editions of the past. With rich and broad knowledge of versions, we can master the literature of this field, and we can identify right and wrong in a realistic way and see the original face of classical works clearly. Therefore, we must go from broad to concise. Otherwise, blindly adhering to old compilations and exclusively following the words of one school will surely mislead ourselves and others. For example, when studying "The Book of Songs," if you only hold the "Mao Shi" edition, you will become more and more confused the more you read it. At least you must also read the Three Schools' editions, Zhu Xi's annotations, and the books of Zheng Qiao, Yao Jiheng, and Fang Yurun, and you must also carefully study the exegesis of the Han scholars of the Qing Dynasty, so that you can understand everything thoroughly and not distort or misunderstand. Second, we should organize and study many different editions, remove the false and fabricated ones, and preserve the good and true ones. We should not completely believe in the ancients, nor should we completely doubt them. We should be modest and cautious, not be proud of temporary unique insights, and not exaggerate our own novel views. The annotations should be clear and understandable, but every sentence should have a basis, that is, a solid basis, and a serious textual research effort should be made. In short, the first essential is to organize with a spirit of seeking truth from facts and a humble attitude. When it comes to popularization, we must be responsible to the broad masses of people, and at the same time, we must be responsible to the original author. This responsibility is great and arduous. How can we not work with the utmost care? Third, we should not only annotate the sentences, but also study and criticize the content. To study and criticize a work, we must study its author, and to study the author, we must study and understand the author's era. This is not something that can be done hastily either. With extensive historical knowledge and a scientific research foundation, we can dissect it like a butcher dismembering an ox, revealing its truth and clarifying its true meaning. The broad masses of readers need such research and criticism. Fourth, we must have a spirit of criticism and self-criticism, humbly accept or consider the opinions of others, and launch discussions to help each other. Research work is not done behind closed doors, but requires collective exploration.

    All of this work must be done well and successfully under the shining light of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, classical literature researchers must first work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Otherwise, all research will take detours or even go astray.

    The classical literary heritage is rich, extraordinarily rich. The broad masses of people urgently need to enjoy and digest these rich heritages. Classical literature researchers have an unshirkable responsibility to liberate the classical literary heritage from the heavy fog and hand it over to the broad masses of people to enjoy.

    为做好古典文学的普及工作而努力
    郑振铎
    古典文学作品离我们好像是很远，其实是很近；它们好像和我们的创作关系不太大，其实却是血脉相贯，呼吸相通。我们和古典文学之间是具有千丝万缕的因缘的。
    一个诗人，不是从天上掉下来的；他是在中国的土地上生长起来的，他是吸取着中国历代人民的优秀的诗的养料而发展起来的。他是一个诗人，但完全脱离不开中国的土地、人民，中国的革命斗争，同时也脱离不开中国诗的优良传统的薰染与影响。否则他就不是一个中国的诗人。不可能想像，一个中国诗人，他会对于中国诗的优良传统一无所知，一无所吸取的。中国诗的优良传统是绵绵不绝的具有二千五百年以上的历史，而且产生出不止几个，几十个，而是以千百计的伟大的诗人。
    这只是一个例子。作为一个中国的小说家、戏曲家、散文家等等，也是完全不能漠视中国的悠久的优良的传统的。“宋元话本”、“水浒”、“三国志演义”、“红楼梦”和元人杂剧，明人传奇，对于我们都是有益有用的。
    同时，广大的人民对于流传甚广、甚久的古代戏曲、小说、诗歌等等，是喜见乐闻的，很古的戏曲，像“牧羊记”的“望乡”、“金印记”的“交印、刺字”、“玉簪记”的“秋江”，很古的小说，像
    “水浒”、“三国志演义”等等，很古的诗歌，像
    “孔雀东南飞”、“木兰辞”、“山歌”等等，都是虽古而仍然新鲜活泼的；他们活在人民的心头，也活在人民的口头。广大人民是迫切需要读到并且享用到最好的和最有益的古典文学遗产的。
    但问题就来了：在大洋大海似的古老的各式各样的文学作品里，什么作品才算得是古典文学作品呢？什么才算得是属于优良的古典文学传统的作品呢？
    我们可以肯定的说，并非一切古老的各式各样的文学作品，或在几十年前几百年前印刷出来的线装书，统统都是古典文学作品或是属于优良的文学传统的作品。
    古典文学或优良的文学传统的作品这个名称，本身就包含有好的，有生命的，健康的，对我们有益、有用的意义在内。所谓古典文学不仅是因为它是时代比较古老的作家们所写的作品，同时，更重要的，是因为它有伟大的不朽的人民性，是不朽的现实主义的作品，有不朽的艺术成就，所以才能到现在还活着，到现在还为广大人民所喜见乐闻。
    所谓古典文学遗产，就是指的那些有不朽的人民性的、现实主义的至今还为广大人民所喜见乐闻的作品。他们真实而深刻的反映出当时的社会矛盾，表现着当时人民的喜怒哀乐，替广大人民叙说出他们所希望的，所祈求的，所反对的，或所憎恨的心情。他们必定是出于大作家的手笔，那些大作家是具有深厚的文艺修养的，是像周扬同志所说的
    “在艺术技巧上达到可惊的准确和精练程度的”，是没有败笔的完整的作品。例如诗，那韵节一定是像大珠小珠落玉盘似的清亮，是掷地作金玉之声的，那情感一定是像长江大河似的汹涌澎湃的；那想像和辞华一定是像夏晨的清露在上面打滚的荷叶似的新鲜嫩绿的，同时，所歌唱的主题也一定是与当时人民同脉搏，同呼吸的。
    同时，他们所表现的中国人民的历史是最真实、最生动的，具有极其丰富与正确的史料价值。在许多历史书上是不一定能找得出有同样重要的根据。要了解古代生活，撇开了“诗经”是不行的。唐代的社会矛盾，民生疾苦，最好的最真实的描写和记载，是存在于杜甫、白居易诸伟大诗人的诗集里。还有比“水浒”写得更生动的“官逼民反”，所谓“迫上梁山”的历史书么？在那里，人民的斗争的经验与其英勇事迹是感人的，是有用的。那一连串的人民斗争史和今日的斗争，是分割不断的。广大人民是需要更多的知道过去的生动的斗争历史，人民英雄们的英勇事迹，需要更多的了解过去的尖锐的社会矛盾的；也就是说，广大人民是需要大量的读到古典文学作品的。
    像那样的古典文学遗产，在绵绵不绝的二千多年的文学历史上是很多的，是屈指数不尽的。我们不能不以我们有那末丰富的古典文学遗产而感到骄傲。我们不得不感谢过去的那末多的伟大作家们遗留给我们那末丰富的不朽的作品。
    但问题又来了：我们将怎样把那末丰富的古典文学遗产加以普及呢？将怎样使他们对于我们更有益、有用呢？古典文学研究者们的重要任务就在这里。
    古典文学研究者们必须运用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想。马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的真理，像太阳似的照耀在天空；一切古代作品放在这光天化日之下，便会看得更明白，更正确，不会变形，更不会变质。原来为古老的批评和注释所歪曲、所迷误的，在这时候就会迷雾全消，真相大白了。什么是古典作品，什么是古典文学的优良传统的作品，什么不是的，便会一望而知，一见即辨。在这个普遍真理指导下的研究工作，会替古典作品洗刷去不少尘垢，使其晶光大发，也会使那些冒牌的无聊之作，丑态毕露，无所容身。在这里，把一部作品或一个作家孤立起来研究，或把文学的历史孤立起来研究的事实就不会有了。文学创作事业离不开经济基础，离不开时代影响，离不开社会矛盾。一个伟大的古典作家或一部伟大的古典作品，必定是对当时的社会矛盾有极端锐敏的感觉并敢于揭露这些矛盾而加以生动的描写的。所谓现实主义的作品，不管它是用“西游记”、“封神传”，或“镜花缘”的夸张而幻想的写法，或是用“三国志演义”、“水浒”、“红楼梦”、“儒林外史”的写实的写法，其主要的一点就在敢于揭发、暴露乃至反抗、打击当时的统治阶级的黑暗与残酷，也就是描写当时的深刻的社会矛盾的。是伟大的作家，就必定是充满了正义感的，同情于人民的疾苦的。
    在广阔无涯的古典文学遗产的土地上，还有不少未被过去的人所发现的东西。特别是地方戏本，民间歌谣，和其他流传于各地的故事，传说，（抄写的，印刷出来的或流传在人民口头上的）均尚待大量的加以搜集和整理。这是必须加以注意的。但这不等于说就不要注意那些最易得、最易见、最流行的作品了。最流行的作品，自有其流行的原因。为千百代广大人民所喜爱，并不是偶然的，或可以徼幸的获得的。像水浒、西厢，为广大人民所喜见乐闻的，虽历经统治阶级和所谓“卫道之士”所禁止，所烧毁，但那是禁止不了，烧毁不尽的。
    怎样使那些最流行的，或若干新发现的古典文学遗产普及呢？怎样使广大人民都能欣赏它们呢？有的古典文学，离得年代太远了，其“语言”本身就发生了好些障碍，非加上明白晓畅的注释是不容易叫现代的读者们读懂得的，（像“诗经”、“楚辞”）或有许多当时的“方言”、“行语”，“前代故实”之类，也是必须加以疏释才会明白的。这是一个很具体的问题。为了使大多数人不浪费精力寻找古典作品的难解的意义，比较少数的人，专门的古典文学研究者，就有责任多花费时间，多用力量把古典作品的“文字障碍”和其他不便于广大读者阅读的障碍都打扫干净。做好这个普及工作是一件不太容易的事。过去有了不少注释的书，像“诗经”，就有了不下千种的历代的“注”家，像“楚辞”，也有了不下百家的各种的注本。有的还对我们很有用，但有的却是糊涂得很的胡说八道，令人越看越不明白。最需要注解的地方是不注的或注得糊里糊涂的，但不需要解释的地方却又注得很多。又，像金圣叹那样批释“西厢记”和“水浒”，夹叙夹议，凌迟碎割，反给读者造成障碍。在那里，是太多的金圣叹，太少的王实甫和施耐庵。像所谓“红学”那样的牵强附会，转弯抹角做索隐工作，也实在是“可怜无补费精神”之举。还不如撇开一切注解，直看本文，更会体会了解得深刻。但这是对有修养的专家的说法，不是对一般的读者说的。广大的创作家和广大的读者们是迫切需要浅显明白的正确的注释本的。决不能再使他们迷失在纷纭、难解的注释的浓雾中了。必须有晓日出而浓雾消散的“定本”出来才好。所以，做好古典文学遗产的注释工作乃是一切古典文学研究者所必须用全心全意来从事的长期的事业。
    要做好注释的工作，必须首先广泛的搜集异本，多看过去的注释本。有了丰富广博的版本知识，才能掌握着本门的文献，才能实事求是的辨明是非，看清古典作品的本来面目。故必须由博返约。否则死守陈编，独遵一家之言，一定会自误误人。像研究“诗经”，如只抱着“毛诗”一本，必会越看越糊涂。至少还要读三家诗，还要读朱熹注，还要读郑樵、姚际恒、方玉润诸家之书，还要仔细研究清代汉学家的训诂之学，才能融会贯通，不至曲解或误解。第二是，把许多异本加以整理，研究，去其妄者、伪者，存其善者、真者。不尽信古，也不完全疑古。虚心谨慎，不矜一时的特见，不夸大自己的新奇的主张。是明白晓畅的注释，但句句是有本之谈，即有坚实的根据，并下过一番认真的考据工夫的。总之，以实事求是的精神，虚怀若谷的态度来整理是第一要义。说到普及就必须对广大人民负责，同时，也必须对原作者负责。这责任是重大的，也是艰巨的。怎能不翼翼小心地进行工作呢？第三是，不仅注释其文句，也应该研究、批判其内容。研究、批判一部作品，就必须研究其作者，要研究作者，就必须研究、了解作者的时代。这也不是可以草率从事的。有渊博的历史知识和科学的研究基础，才能像庖丁解牛似的，抉发其真相，阐明其真实的意义。广大的读者是需要这样的研究和批判的。第四是，必须有批评和自我批评的精神，虚心接受或考虑别人的意见，展开讨论，互相帮助。研究工作，不是关门来做的，是需要集体的探讨的。
    凡这一切工作，都必须是在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的光辉照耀之下才能做得好，做得成功的。故古典文学研究者，首先必须刻苦用功的学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想。否则，一切研究，便都要走弯路甚至误入歧途的。
    古典文学遗产是丰富的，是异常丰富的。广大人民是迫切的需要享受、消化这些丰富的遗产的。古典文学研究者责无旁贷的要把古典文学遗产从重重的迷障之中解放出来，交给广大人民享用。
