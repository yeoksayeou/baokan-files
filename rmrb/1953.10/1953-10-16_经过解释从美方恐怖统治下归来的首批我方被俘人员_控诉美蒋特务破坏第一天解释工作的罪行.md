(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th) Ten Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who requested repatriation after explanation today returned to Panmunjom at 8 p.m. In our reception tent, they accused the American-Chiang Kai-shek agents to the neutral nations personnel and reporters present of threatening the prisoners of war and sabotaging today's explanation work.

They had just escaped from extreme terrorist control, and their expressions of fear and bewilderment had not completely disappeared. They said: Our people are scared by the special agents! They refer to today's explanation by the term used in the past by the US side for illegal bloody screening - "review". Due to the chilling and deep memories, they dare not believe that they can really come back.

These returning personnel did not hear the Neutral Nations Repatriation Committee's broadcast about the rights of prisoners of war, and even did not know that the explanation was about to begin this morning. It was not until the special agents specifically arranged anti-explanation activities before leaving the camp that they knew that the explanation work was about to begin. Returning personnel Zhang Mingqing and Tang Zhiyong said that this morning, the battalion commander and deputy battalion commander of their camp went to see the explanation site as "prisoner of war representatives," and then came back and arranged: "When you go to listen to the explanation today, no one is allowed to go through the back door of the tent (i.e., the exit for those who request repatriation). If anyone takes that road, everyone will rush over and beat him to death on command, and shout that the Communist Party is forcing the prisoners of war to return." The special agents also conducted strict formation of the prisoners of war, one person following another. If the person in front requests repatriation, the person behind will be beaten to death when he returns. It is very difficult to find a chance to escape. When they risked walking to the tent prepared for repatriation, the special agents were still yelling to beat them to death. Returning personnel Chen Changyou said: "I know that many people want to return to China, but the special agents have been scaring us all day long, saying: You have tattoos all over your body, and when you go back, the Communist Party will skin you alive. You can't leave even if you want to. If we catch you, we will beat you to death with random stones."

The returning personnel today unanimously revealed that during our explanation work, the American-Chiang Kai-shek agents who appeared as US representatives continued to threaten them. The ten people who returned today came from nine explanation tents. They all saw Taiwanese special agents with US symbols hanging in the explanation tents, serving as US representatives or translators. Returning personnel Guo Yunsheng said: "In the explanation tent that I passed through today, there was a CIE Chiang Kai-shek special agent who had given us reactionary lessons on Jeju Island in the past. I have seen him many times. When I said I wanted to return to China, he glared at me fiercely, and his face suddenly became so terrible!" Returning personnel Lin Fengtang also saw a Taiwanese Chiang Kai-shek special agent named Wang acting as the US observer representative in the explanation tent where he was located.

### 经过解释从美方恐怖统治下归来的首批我方被俘人员  控诉美蒋特务破坏第一天解释工作的罪行

    经过解释从美方恐怖统治下归来的首批我方被俘人员
    控诉美蒋特务破坏第一天解释工作的罪行
    【新华社开城十五日电】今天经过解释以后要求遣返的十名中国人民志愿军被俘人员，已经在下午八时回到了板门店。他们就在我方接待帐篷中向在场的中立国人员及记者们控诉了美蒋特务威胁战俘、破坏今天的解释工作的罪行。
    他们是刚刚从极大的恐怖控制下逃脱出来的，惊恐和恍惚的神色还没有完全消除。他们说：我们的人都被特务吓住了！他们对今天的解释用过去美方进行非法的血腥甄别时的名词——“审查”来称呼。由于令人战栗的深刻记忆，他们不敢相信自己真的能回来。
    这些归来人员都没有听到中立国遣返委员会关于战俘权利等事项的广播词，甚至在今日早上还不知道要开始解释，直到在出营场以前特务分子具体布置反解释活动时才知道要开始解释工作。归来人员张明清、唐治永说，今天上午他们那个营场的大队长、大队副等以“战俘代表”身份去看了解释场所以后，回来就布置说：“今天去听解释时谁也不准走帐篷的后门（按即要求遣返者的出口），如果谁走了那条路，大家听命令一齐冲过去把他打死，并喊叫共产党强迫战俘回去。”特务们还把战俘们进行了严密的编队，一个人跟一个人，假如前面有一个人要求遣返，后面的人回去就要被打死。要找一个脱身的机会非常困难。他们冒着危险走到准备遣返的帐篷时，特务们还在吼叫要打死他们。归来人员陈昌有说：“我知道很多人都想回国，但是，特务一天到晚恐吓我们说：你们刺了一身字，回去共产党要活剥你们的皮。你们想走也走不了，我们一下抓回来就用乱石头打死。”
    今天归来的人员一致揭露：在我方解释工作进行中，以美方代表身份出现的美蒋特务还继续威胁他们。今天归来的十个人，是由九个解释帐篷中出来的。他们都看见解释帐篷中有挂着US符号的台湾特务，充任美方代表或翻译。归来人员郭运胜说：“今天在我通过的那个解释帐篷就有一个ＣＩＥ蒋匪特务，过去曾经在济州岛给我们上过反动课，我见过他很多次。当我一说要回国，他就用眼睛狠狠地瞪着我，整个脸色突然变得那么可怕！”归来人员林风堂也看见一个姓王的台湾蒋匪特务在他所在的那个解释帐篷里当美方观察代表。
