The fuel industry system has greatly improved its production situation in the third quarter due to actively strengthening plan management and technical management after the second quarter, establishing and improving the responsibility system, and implementing a series of effective emergency measures targeting certain weak links. Coal has fundamentally reversed the situation of failing to complete tasks in the first half of the year. The output of raw coal not only exceeded the national plan, but also exceeded the increased production plan, completing 105.3% of the third quarter plan. The excess amount in September alone compensated for 56.4% of the underproduction in the first half of the year. Except for one area in the Northeast that did not complete its task due to certain special factors, all other areas exceeded their power generation tasks, with the highest exceeding by 6.7%. The national power sales volume in the third quarter reached 101.6%, and all major areas exceeded their tasks. The completion of several economic quotas was also good. For example, the national average coal consumption in September decreased by 0.2%, and the average line loss rate decreased by 6.8%. On the basis of consistently overfulfilling its tasks, the petroleum industry has made great strides forward. In September, some small factories also made great improvements. Compared with the same period last year, coal production increased by 6.3%, power generation increased by 29.8%, crude oil production increased by 10%, and gasoline increased by 28.9%.

The safety situation in coal mines improved significantly in September. The Central South, Southwest, and Northwest regions eliminated fatal accidents. The Beipiao Mining Bureau in the Northeast region conducted a major safety inspection in September, reversing the serious accident situation in the past, and there were no deaths or serious injuries in the entire month.

The improvement or further increase in production began in August. By September, due to the unfolding of the increased production and economizing campaign, the vast majority of factory and mine workers were involved in the campaign. Under the principle of ensuring that it does not affect the preparation work for next year, a lot of work has been done to improve product and repair quality, ensure safety, and pay attention to the internal and external balance of the enterprise. In particular, the enthusiasm and creativity of the factory and mine workers were highly developed, and engineering and technical personnel also actively participated, which made the production situation develop more healthily. For example, the Fushun Mining Bureau further carried out the daily progress competition and checked the past operation plan, corrected some shortcomings, and made the operation plan effectively guide production, and the output increased significantly. The Fuxin Ping'an No. 3 Mine found that the main reason for the failure to complete the operation plan in the past was that the preparation work for production could not keep up. After mobilizing the masses, the key problems were solved. By the 23rd of September, the coal mining plan had been completed by 96.6%, and the tunneling task was completed seven days ahead of schedule. The Kailuan Coal Mine established an engineer and technician meeting and an engineer three-shift system, which played a great role in solving production technology problems in a timely manner. The output of the mine in September has broken through the highest level in history. The Jiawang Mining Bureau has done a good job in preparing the connecting site, ensuring balanced production, and generally maintaining a cycle of one day. After the Tangshan Power Plant launched the increase production and economizing campaign, from the workshop team to the individual, more than 260 large and small problems were exposed, and the path to improving the enterprise management level was found from the exposure of problems. Power plants in Fushun, Fuxin, Huainan, and Tangshan have made great achievements in burning inferior coal, which has greatly reduced fuel costs. Factories in Xi'an and Guangzhou have also made great achievements in adjusting the load. For the key issue of ensuring safe electricity use in industrial and mining enterprises, all units are very clear from top to bottom. The comprehensive gasoline refining rate, due to the active promotion of Wang Kuan's advanced operation methods, reached a maximum of over 7.7% higher than the Petroleum Administration Bureau's requirements in mid-September. No defective products were produced in August and September.

Since it is estimated that with the increase in production quantity, further balance must be sought in materials, transportation, and equipment maintenance, in this regard, the Central Fuel Industry Department and the various specialized management bureaus used production scheduling reports to check, supervise, and instruct safety production and improve quality in telephone calls at any time, and through symposiums, business meetings, and various instructions, responsible comrades went deep into factories and mines to help solve many problems, which played a great role in ensuring the overfulfillment of tasks.

Yumen Mining Bureau has completed the annual crude oil production task two months and seventeen days ahead of schedule on October 13. The quality of crude oil meets the standards.

Since May of this year, the Yumen Mining Bureau Oil Production Plant has earnestly implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, adjusted the labor organization, assigned special personnel to be responsible for mastering the oil wells, and universally opened wells in accordance with the principle of maximum output and reasonable oil recovery. And under the principle of protecting the oil field, the size of the oil nozzle was increased, thereby increasing the production of crude oil. Great achievements have also been made in minor repairs, which has played a certain guarantee role in completing the plan.

The Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government specially sent a telegram to congratulate the mine's workers on their new achievements in production. Now, all the staff and workers of the Yumen Mining Bureau Oil Production Plant are striving to complete the glorious task of increasing crude oil production by 100,000 tons this year.

    超额完成第三季度国家生产计划
    玉门矿务局提前完成全年原油生产任务
    燃料工业系统由于在第二季度后积极加强了计划管理、技术管理，建立并健全了责任制度，并针对某些薄弱环节，进行了一系列有效的紧急措施，第三季生产情况已大大好转。煤已根本扭转了上半年完不成任务的局面，原煤产量不仅超额完成了国家计划，还超额完成了增产计划，完成第三季度计划的百分之一百零五点三，仅九月份超额数量就已补偿了上半年欠产的百分之五十六点四。发电量除东北一个区由于某种特殊因素，未完成任务外，其他各区都超额完成了任务，最多的超额百分之六点七，全国第三季度售电量完成百分之一百零一点六，各个大区都超额完成了任务。几种经济定额完成的情况也不错，如九月份煤耗全国平均降低了百分之零点二，线路损失率平均降低了百分之六点八。石油在一贯超额完成任务的基础上，又前进了一大步，九月份某些小厂也有很大的改进。与去年同期比较，煤的产量增加了百分之六点三，发电量增加了百分之二十九点八，原油产量增加了百分之十，汽油增加了百分之二十八点九。
    煤矿的安全情况九月份有了不少改进，中南、西南、西北三区都消灭了死亡事故。东北区北票矿务局在九月份进行了一次安全大检查，扭转了过去事故严重的局面，全月没有发生死亡及重伤事故。
    生产情况好转或更加提高是从八月份开始的。到九月份由于增产节约竞赛的展开，绝大部分厂矿职工都卷入了竞赛的热潮，在保证不影响明年准备工作的原则下，对于提高产品及检修质量，保证安全，注意企业内部与外部平衡上都做了不少工作。特别是各厂矿职工高度发挥了积极性与创造性，工程技术人员也积极参加，这就使生产情况更加健康地向前发展。如抚顺矿务局进一步开展日进度竞赛，并检查了过去作业计划的情况，纠正了某些缺点，使作业计划切实地指导生产，产量显著提高。阜新平安三坑找出了过去影响作业计划完成的主要原因是生产的准备工作跟不上，经过发动群众，解决了关键性的问题，九月份采煤计划到二十三日就完成了百分之九十六点六，并提前七天完成了掘进任务；开滦煤矿建立了工程师、技术员碰头会和工程师三班轮值制，对及时解决生产技术问题起了很大作用，该矿九月份产量已突破了历史上最高水平。贾汪矿务局作好了接续场子的准备工作，保证了均衡生产，一般都能保持一天一个循环。唐山发电厂开展增产节约竞赛后，从车间小组到个人，揭发了大小问题二百六十多件，从揭发问题中找到了提高企业管理水平的门径。抚顺、阜新、淮南、唐山等电厂对烧劣质煤都有很大成绩，使燃料成本降低很多。西安、广州等厂在调整负荷上也有不少成绩。对于保证工矿安全用电这一关键性问题，各单位则是从上到下都非常明确的。汽油综合炼率，由于积极推广王宽班的先进操作方法，在九月中旬最高曾超过石油总局要求百分之七点七。八、九月份并已消灭了次品。
    由于估计到随着生产数量的增长，在材料、运输以及设备检修维护等方面，必须进一步求得平衡，在这一方面，中央燃料工业部及各专业管理总局利用生产调度汇报，在电话中随时检查、督促、指示安全生产和提高质量的问题，并通过座谈会、业务会议及各种指示与负责同志深入厂矿，具体帮助，解决了不少问题，对于保证超额完成任务，是起了很大作用的。    （中央燃料工业部通讯组）
    玉门矿务局已经在十月十三日提前两个月零十七天完成了全年的原油生产任务。原油质量合乎标准。
    玉门矿务局采油厂从今年五月份以后，认真地执行了苏联专家的建议，调整了劳动组织，由专人负责掌握油井，同时按照最大产量、合理采油的原则，普遍开井。并在保护油田的原则下，加大油咀，因此增加了原油的产量。在小修工作上也获得了很大的成绩，对完成计划起了一定的保证作用。
    中央人民政府燃料工业部石油管理总局特致电祝贺该矿职工在生产方面获得的新成就。现在，玉门矿务总局采油厂全体职工，正在努力争取完成今年增产原油十万吨的光荣任务。
