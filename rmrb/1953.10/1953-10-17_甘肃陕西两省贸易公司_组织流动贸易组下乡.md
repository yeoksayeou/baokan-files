    Trade Companies in Gansu and Shaanxi Provinces
    Organize Mobile Trade Teams to Go to the Countryside
    To coordinate with the grain procurement work, the trade companies in Gansu and Shaanxi provinces have organized mobile teams to go to the countryside to supply farmers with a large quantity of production and living materials. Gansu and Shaanxi provinces are rich in grain production, and wheat has generally had a bumper harvest this year. Farmers' purchasing power has generally increased after selling their grain. To adapt to this situation, the Gansu Provincial Trade Company dispatched 113 cadres in mid-to-late August to various special districts in the province to coordinate the work of grain procurement and promoting industrial products. At present, the Dingxi Branch Company has established 10 mobile teams and one store; the Tianshui Branch Company has established 11 mobile teams; and the Pingliang Branch Company has established 7 mobile teams. These mobile teams carry a large number of essential materials needed by farmers and go deep into areas where there are grain procurement agencies but no trade company or cooperative agencies, coordinating with grain procurement and vigorously supplying farmers' needs.
    In August, the Shaanxi Provincial Trade Company focused on organizing 16 mobile trade teams in Weinan, Baoji, Xianyang, and other major wheat-producing areas. Zhang Dianren and Deng Wenqing, the company's manager and deputy manager, went to various places to guide and supervise. The teams went deep into the countryside to carry out business. Because the mobile teams prepared goods that were plentiful, good, and suitable for farmers' needs, the amount of grain purchased increased generally. Comparing the amount purchased by the Dalifang Town Cooperative before and after, it has increased by 120%. The farmers happily said, "Since the mobile team came, we can sell grain and buy goods at the same time without delaying production. It's really too convenient." (Fang Chengjie)

    甘肃陕西两省贸易公司
    组织流动贸易组下乡
    甘肃、陕西两省贸易公司，配合收购粮食工作，组织流动组下乡，大量供应农民生产与生活资料。甘肃、陕西两省粮食出产丰富，今年各地小麦普遍丰收，农民出卖粮食后，购买力普遍提高。为适应这一情况，甘肃省贸易公司于八月中、下旬，抽派干部一百一十三人，分赴该省各专区进行配合收粮推销工业品的工作。目前定西分公司成立十个流动组，一个门市部；天水分公司成立十一个流动组；平凉分公司成立七个流动组。这些流动组携带大批农民必需的物资，深入到有粮食收购机构而无贸易公司及合作社机构的地方，配合收粮，大力供应农民需要。
    陕西省贸易公司于八月中在渭南、宝鸡、咸阳等主要产麦地区，重点组织十六个流动贸易小组，该公司张殿仁、邓文卿正副经理等分赴各地指导督促，各小组深入农村，开展业务。由于流动组准备的货物又多又好，又能适合农民需要，所以粮食收购量随着普遍增加，以大荔坊镇合作社前后收购量比较，就比过去加大了百分之一百二十，农民高兴地说：“流动组来了以后，我们可以一手卖粮、一手买货，不再耽误生产，真是太方便了。”（方承杰）
