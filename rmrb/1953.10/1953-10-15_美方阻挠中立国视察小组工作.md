Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 14th: The Mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Team dispatched by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission departed from Kaesong by plane on the 14th to Sinŭiju, then transferred to Ŭiju, to investigate the U.S. accusation that the Korean-Chinese side had crated and transported reinforcing warplanes into the Ŭiju airport. The U.S. side could not provide any facts or evidence in its accusation. General Li Xiangchao of the Korean-Chinese side has pointed out that the U.S. accusation is groundless. At this moment, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission received a report from the Neutral Nations Inspection Team stationed at the port of Pusan, South Korea, stating that the U.S. side had notified the team on the 6th that neutral nations inspection teams would no longer be permitted to conduct inspections or other neutral nations inspection team activities on U.S. ships. The U.S. obstruction of the work of the neutral nations inspection teams is clearly aimed at transporting a large amount of reinforcing war materiel into South Korea. This fact further proves that the U.S. made a baseless accusation in order to cover up its own violation of the armistice agreement by transporting reinforcing war materiel.

    美方阻挠中立国视察小组工作
    【新华社开城十四日电】中立国监察委员会派遣的机动中立国视察小组已在十四日从开城出发，乘飞机到新义州转往义州，调查美方提出的据说是朝中方面把增援性的作战飞机装箱运入义州机场的事件。美方在它的指控中提不出任何事实和证据，朝中方面李相朝将军已指出美方的指控是毫无根据的。就在这时，中立国监察委员会收到驻南朝鲜釜山口岸的中立国视察小组的报告称，美方已在六日通知小组，今后不准中立国视察小组在美国船只上进行视察或其他中立国视察小组的活动。美方阻挠中立国视察小组进行工作，目的显然在于要把大量增援性的作战物资运入南朝鲜。这一事实更加证明，美方提出毫无根据的指控，就是为了掩盖它自己违反停战协定运入增援性的作战物资。
