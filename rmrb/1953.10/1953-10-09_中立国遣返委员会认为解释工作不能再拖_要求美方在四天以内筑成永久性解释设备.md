Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) today, in a memorandum, demanded that the US side build permanent facilities for conducting explanation work within four days, otherwise it will allow engineers from the Korean People’s Army and the Chinese People’s Volunteers to construct such facilities.

The NNRC told the US side in the memorandum: “Your estimate of time means that the start of formal explanation work will be delayed. It also means that the explanation period will be shortened by approximately forty-one days. The Commission is not prepared to shorten the explanation period, especially given that the United Nations Command does not agree to extend the date for ending the explanation work. …The Commission now requests that you either construct permanent facilities within four days, or allow the Korean People’s Army and the Chinese People’s Volunteers to take action according to their proposal.”

The memorandum stated: “The Commission believes that the time estimated by you in your letter of October 3, 1953, and reiterated in yesterday's letter, for the construction of facilities for explanation is too long. This conclusion is based on:
	Observations made on the site;
	An assessment of the technical and personnel strength currently available to the United Nations Command;
	The NNRC has expressed to you its willingness to provide additional manpower;
	The Korean People’s Army and the Chinese People’s Volunteers Command have repeatedly assured that they are ready to begin construction and complete all permanent construction within four days.”

The memorandum stated: “Since the construction of facilities for explanation has been delayed for various reasons beyond any reasonable limit, the Commission hopes to receive a reply to this letter before 10:00 AM on October 9, 1953.”

The memorandum also pointed out that the US side's refusal to build a road west of the Indian Custodial Forces area and parallel to the military demarcation line further increases the difficulty of the NNRC in performing its mission. “Without such a road, the Indian Custodial Forces cannot effectively perform their tasks. The Indian Custodial Forces are responsible for ensuring the safety of the explanation personnel, translators, journalists, and NNRC members within and around the explanation area. The Indian Custodial Army must also ensure that prisoners of war do not cause any disturbances. Because the road you wish to build is close to the POW camp, the Indian Custodial Forces will not be able to perform all of the above tasks.”

(Note: If such a road is built, the representatives and personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers can go to the NNRC custodial area for explanation work without having to pass through the US-controlled area south of the demilitarized zone.)

The memorandum stated that the NNRC hopes to know "whether the United Nations Command is prepared and willing to complete the necessary engineering work before 9:00 PM on October 14, or whether it will allow the Korean People’s Army and the Chinese People’s Volunteers Command to proceed according to their proposal."

### 中立国遣返委员会认为解释工作不能再拖  要求美方在四天以内筑成永久性解释设备

    中立国遣返委员会认为解释工作不能再拖
    要求美方在四天以内筑成永久性解释设备
   【新华社开城八日电】中立国遣返委员会今天在一个备忘录中要求美方在四天以内筑成供进行解释工作之用的永久性设备，否则将让朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的工兵建筑这种设备。
    中立国遣返委员会在备忘录中告诉美方说：“你方对时间的估计意味着正式解释工作开始的时间将要推迟。它还意味着解释期限将缩短四十一天左右。委员会不准备使解释期限缩短，特别是鉴于联合国军司令部不同意延长结束解释工作的日期。……委员会现在要求你方或者在四天以内筑成永久性设备，或者就让朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军按照他们的建议采取行动。”
    备忘录说：“委员会认为，你方在一九五三年十月三日的来信中所说的、并在昨天来信中重申的估计筑成供解释用的设备所需的时间是太长了。这个结论的根据是：
    对这个场所进行的观察；
    对联合国军司令部现有的技术与人员方面的力量的估计；
    中立国遣返委员会曾向你方表示愿意供给另外一些人力；
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部曾一再保证说，他们准备着手建筑并在四天以内完成全部永久性建筑。”
    备忘录说：“由于供解释之用的设备的建筑工作已经由于各种原因而拖延到任何合理的限度以外，委员会希望在一九五三年十月九日上午十时以前能得到对于这封信的答复。”
    备忘录并指出：美方拒绝建筑一条在印度看管部队地区以西并且和军事分界线平行的道路，这更增加了中立国遣返委员会在执行任务方面的困难。“没有这样一条道路，印度看管部队就不能有效地执行任务。印度看管部队有责任在解释地区以内和解释地区周围保证解释人员、翻译人员、记者以及中立国遣返委员会委员的安全。印度看管军还要保证战俘不制造任何骚乱。由于你方希望建筑的道路紧靠着战俘营，印度看管部队将不能执行上述的一切任务。”
    （按：如果筑成这样一条道路，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的代表和人员在前往中立国遣返委员会看管地区进行解释工作时，就可以不必通过非军事区以南的美方控制的地区。）
    备忘录说：中立国遣返委员会希望知道，“联军司令部是准备而且愿意在十月十四日下午九时以前完成必要的工程，还是让朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部按照他们的建议进行工作。”
