Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 14th: Our correspondent reports: According to the requirements of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the explanation work by the Korean and Chinese side will begin on the 15th. However, it is foreseeable that the explanation work beginning tomorrow will not be peaceful and smooth.

    The US side's sudden change of its original delaying tactics, notifying that the construction of all explanation facilities would be completed by midnight on the 13th, clearly does not indicate that the US side has abandoned its conspiracy to sabotage the explanation work. The US side will carry out sabotage in all aspects from the first day of the explanation work. Sources say that the US side has set up two so-called "checkpoints" on the way to the Dongchang-ri explanation site for the Korean and Chinese explanation representatives, attempting to obstruct the passage of the Korean and Chinese personnel, in order to delay as many hours as possible from the daily eight-hour explanation time.

    At the same time, various indications show that the special agents of the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs, pre-arranged by the US side in the prisoner-of-war camps, will carry out sabotage activities with all their might according to the instructions they received in advance. The Associated Press has revealed today that some so-called "Allied officers" (actually American agents who command the Rhee and Chiang agents in the camps) who "have spent many months with these prisoners of war" said that the prisoners of war "will resist fiercely" and they "frankly predict there will be trouble." They revealed that the agents will force the prisoners of war to "lock arms tightly to refuse to move," "riot," "arbitrarily change their names, and make trouble for the personnel of the prisoner-of-war camps by other means." United Press International even threatened that the explanation work "may cause bloodshed."

    In view of the US side's conspiracy of sabotage, people have every reason to hope that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission will fairly take all necessary measures to ensure the smooth progress of the explanation work, so that the "Terms of Reference" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work" can be implemented.

    根据中立国遣返委员会的要求
    朝中方面将于今日开始解释工作
    迹象表明美方阴谋在解释过程中继续进行破坏
    【新华社开城十四日电】本社特派记者报道：朝中方面根据中立国遣返委员会的要求，解释工作将于十五日开始。但是可以预料，朝中方面在明天开始的解释工作将不会是平静和顺利的。
    美方突然改变原来的拖延策略，通知在十三日午夜完成全部解释设备的修建，这件事显然丝毫也不表示美方已放弃了破坏解释工作的阴谋。美方将从解释工作的第一天起从各方面进行破坏。有消息说，美方在朝中解释代表前往东场里解释地点的途中设置了两个所谓“检查站”，企图阻难朝中方面人员的通行，以便从每天八小时的解释时间中尽可能多地延宕掉几小时。
    同时，种种迹象表明：美方预先布置在战俘营里的李承晚、蒋介石匪帮的特务，将按照他们预先领受的指示，施展全副本领来进行破坏活动。美联社今天已经透露，有一些所谓“曾经和这些战俘相处了许多个月”的“联军官员”（实际上就是指挥营场中的李、蒋特务的美国特务）说，战俘们“将激烈反抗”，他们“坦率地预言会出乱子”。他们透露，特务们将强迫战俘“互相挽紧臂膀一致拒绝行动”，“进行暴动”，“随意改变姓名和用其他方法来和战俘营的人员为难”。合众社更扬言解释工作“可能引起流血事件”。
    鉴于美方的这种破坏阴谋，人们有充分理由希望中立国遣返委员会将公正地采取一切必要措施，保证解释工作的顺利进行，使“职权范围”以及“解释和访问工作细则”得以贯彻实施。
