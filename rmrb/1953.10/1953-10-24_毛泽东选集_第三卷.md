    "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume III
     Soviet Union  Fèi Délín

    The Russian edition of Volume III of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" has been published. The Russian edition of Volume III includes Mao Zedong's writings from May 1939 to May 1941. This period was a critical and crucial juncture in the Chinese people's heroic struggle for their national and social liberation. As everyone knows, due to the traitorous policies of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, the Kuomintang army suffered a series of disastrous defeats, resulting in large swathes of territory falling into the hands of the enemy, Japanese militarists, including strategically valuable major cities and industrial centers such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Changsha. By the end of 1938, the Kuomintang army had virtually ceased active military operations.

    The people's army founded by the Communist Party was a powerful force actively fighting the Japanese invaders. By 1940, within the first three years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the number of people's army had grown from 40,000 to approximately 500,000. The population of the liberated and guerrilla areas was nearly 100 million. The rapid growth of the people's patriotic armed forces led by the Communist Party, the extensive development of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, and the establishment of strong and solid democratic base areas changed the course of the war.

    Under the fierce attacks of the people's armed forces, the Japanese army was unable to conduct large-scale offensives. Taking advantage of the Kuomintang army's inaction, the Japanese command concentrated its main forces to attack the people's army led by the Chinese Communist Party: the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the guerrilla forces.

    While concentrating its forces to attack the people's army, Japanese imperialism adopted the so-called "political offensive" against the Kuomintang. The purpose of this political tactic was to split the anti-Japanese national united front and to exchange false concessions for Chiang Kai-shek's surrender, in order to suppress the people's army with the help of Chinese reactionary forces. At this time, a group of comprador bourgeoisie, feudal landlords, warlords, and Kuomintang politicians, headed by the traitor Wang Jingwei, defected to the Japanese invasion camp and signed traitorous treaties with Japan, handing over large swaths of Chinese territory to the Japanese as their colonies.

    Another part of the comprador bourgeoisie, landlords, and warlords, headed by the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang clique, although formally participating in the anti-Japanese national united front, were in fact engaging in activities to undermine the united front. The Kuomintang resumed its policy of terror and repression against democratic forces and the Communist Party. In June 1939, the Kuomintang carried out a bloody suppression of the staff of the New Fourth Army's liaison office in Pingjiang. In January 1941, a large number of Kuomintang troops began military actions to eliminate the New Fourth Army troops stationed in Anhui Province and attacked the army's headquarters.

    Military provocations against the people's army also began in other parts of China. Under Chiang Kai-shek's orders, the Kuomintang army began to blockade the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the central base area of the Eighth Route Army. The trend of capitulation by the diehards and the split of the united front became increasingly apparent in the Kuomintang's policies. British and American imperialism also did not hesitate to sacrifice the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation, attempting to collude with Japanese militarism and plot a new "Eastern Munich" conspiracy. This complicated the situation in China.

    In the works collected in Volume III of the Russian edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, provided a theoretical analysis of the Chinese Communist Party's political line, strategy, and tactics during this period, determined the future and path for defeating imperialism and feudal forces, and deeply and comprehensively planned the construction of a democratic new China.

    (I)

    During this period, the most significant issues in the entire political life of China were: how to strive for national independence and democratic freedom, how to defeat Japanese imperialism, and how to expand and strengthen the anti-Japanese national united front, which was the main condition for resolving the pressing historical tasks at that time.

    In studying the problems of the Communist Party's political strategy and tactics in this stage of the Chinese liberation movement, Mao Zedong first made a profound Marxist analysis of the basic contradictions of Chinese society and carefully studied the nature and characteristics of the developing revolution. Mao Zedong creatively applied Marxist theory to analyze the specific problems of Chinese historical development. In his works such as "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "On New Democracy," he provided a profound scientific analysis of how China changed from a feudal state into a semi-feudal, semi-colonial state.

    Foreign imperialism that invaded China used feudal remnants to oppress and plunder the Chinese people, and tried its best to hinder China's economic development, resulting in China's continuous weakening. Taking advantage of China's weakness under the dual oppression of imperialism and feudalism, the Japanese invaders attempted to enslave the entire China and turn it into their colony. All this determined the deep contradictions of Chinese society. Mao Zedong said in "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party": "The contradiction between imperialism and the Chinese nation, and the contradiction between feudalism and the masses of the people, these are the main contradictions in modern Chinese society. Of course, there are other contradictions, such as the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and the contradictions within the reactionary ruling class. However, the contradiction between imperialism and the Chinese nation is the most important of all contradictions... The great modern and contemporary Chinese revolution has arisen and developed on the basis of these basic contradictions."

    The task of the revolution was to eliminate imperialist rule and eradicate feudalism. Mao Zedong pointed out that this was the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary policy, and that the struggle against imperialist oppression and for national freedom and independence was of paramount importance. During the period covered by the works in Volume III, the most important political task was to crush the Japanese invaders who were attempting to enslave the entire China. This task determined all other issues, such as the main targets of attack, the party's tactics, the forms and methods of struggle, etc.

    Based on the Marxist-Leninist tactical principles and the characteristics of China's anti-Japanese national liberation struggle, Mao Zedong demonstrated and formulated the Chinese working class and its party, the Communist Party's, tactics toward various social groups. He pointed out that the main driving force and leading force of the Chinese revolution was the proletariat. Although the proletariat was small in number and young, it was the most organized, conscious, and decisive class in Chinese society on the stage of political struggle. The peasants, especially the poor and middle peasants, were directly concerned with the elimination of the feudal system and its supporter, imperialism. Therefore, the peasants were the most resolute and unwavering allies of the working class in the struggle for national independence and democratic freedom, and in the struggle for progress. Mao Zedong pointed out that the poor and hired peasants, who accounted for 70 percent of China's rural population, were "the broadest motive force of the Chinese revolution, the natural and most reliable ally of the proletariat, and the main force in the Chinese the revolutionary ranks."

    The urban petty bourgeoisie was also an ally of the proletariat and one of the important revolutionary motive forces, because the petty bourgeoisie could only be liberated under the leadership of the working class. The national bourgeoisie, deeply oppressed by imperialism and bound by feudalism, was also a revolutionary force, although it was an unreliable and wavering force. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, favorable conditions were formed to attract the national bourgeoisie into the united front. Mao Zedong put forward the task of strengthening the united front that unites the national bourgeoisie.

    Mao Zedong put forward and demonstrated the theory that it was possible to utilize certain sections of the comprador bourgeoisie during the War of Resistance Against Japan. This theory was of great significance for the Chinese people's struggle against Japanese aggression. The basis for this possibility was that the various comprador bourgeois groups were supported by various imperialist countries that were fighting each other. Mao Zedong pointed out: "During this certain period, in order to weaken the enemy and strengthen our own reserves, the Chinese proletariat can establish a possible united front with such big bourgeois groups, and maintain it as far as possible under certain conditions favorable to the revolution."

    The Chinese Communist Party actively strived to win over all possible forces in the country to participate in the anti-Japanese national united front and jointly resist the invaders. The Communist Party believed that the national united front was the only way to save China from Japanese enslavement, and therefore consistently carried out a strong struggle for the expansion and strengthening of the united front.

    During this period, the issue of strengthening the anti-Japanese national united front was extremely sharp and extremely urgent, because at that time the Kuomintang group had obviously wavered, attempting to collude with and surrender to the Japanese invaders. In his works such as "Oppose Capitulationist Activities," "It Is Necessary to Sanction the Reactionaries," "The Current Situation and the Party's Tasks," and "Overcome the Danger of Capitulation and Strive for a Turn for the Better in the Situation," Mao Zedong exposed the Kuomintang reactionaries' attempts to collude with Japanese imperialism and launch a criminal civil war in China, and relentlessly lashed out at the capitulationists, elaborating in detail the importance of maintaining and strengthening the united front.

    Mao Zedong wrote in "Oppose Capitulationist Activities": "The war against Japanese imperialism, which has been fought with the flesh and blood of the entire nation for two full years, does not allow the wavering and betrayal of a few people. The anti-Japanese national united front, which has been forged with the efforts of the entire nation, does not allow the sabotage and division of a few people. Fight on, unite on - China will surely survive. Negotiate, split - China will surely perish." The Chinese Communist Party clearly recognized that surrender would lead to national disaster, and therefore called on and mobilized all progressive forces in Chinese society to fight against Japanese imperialism, against traitors and capitulationists, and to fight for saving the motherland and striving for national independence and freedom.

    While strengthening and consolidating the anti-Japanese national united front, it is necessary to overcome the harmful and erroneous "left" leaning closed-doorism and right-leaning opportunist tendencies. The "left" leaning closed-doorism failed to recognize the difference between the position of the Chinese bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie of capitalist countries, and opposed forming an alliance with the Chinese bourgeoisie, which endangered the weakening of the anti-Japanese forces. In contrast, right-leaning opportunism did not recognize the fundamental differences between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in program, policy and practice. Mao Zedong criticized these two tendencies in his introductory remarks for the "Communist" magazine. The anti-Japanese national united front, established on the initiative of the Chinese Communist Party, played a significant role in the development of the Chinese revolution.

    An important feature of the development of the Chinese revolution, a major factor in the entire political life of China, was armed struggle. The experience of the Chinese Communist Party's many years of struggle for the freedom of the people has proved that armed struggle is the main form of revolutionary development. Without armed struggle, the Chinese revolution could not have been victorious. Mao Zedong's contribution lies in: he elucidated the characteristics of the Chinese national liberation struggle, and pointed out that the Chinese people had growing and strengthening armed forces in this struggle, which had a decisive significance for the victory of the revolution. He wrote: "The armed struggle of the Chinese Communist Party is a peasant war under the leadership of the proletariat."

    Mao Zedong closely combined the establishment and strengthening of the anti-Japanese national united front, the expansion of armed struggle, and the growth of the Communist Party ranks and the improvement of its combat effectiveness, and studied them together. As Mao Zedong pointed out, this was the period when the Communist Party became a strong national party that firmly led all domestic democratic forces. Its task was to further train the Party ideologically, organizationally, and politically, to strengthen the close ties between the Party and the people, and, on the basis of unswervingly implementing the united front policy, to resolutely launch armed struggle and lead the people to victory. Subsequent historical events proved how great the vitality and correctness were of Mao Zedong's instructions regarding the nature and dynamics of the revolution, the strategy and tactics of the Communist Party, and the forms and methods of struggle.

    (II)

    Mao Zedong's major contribution to Marxist-Leninist theory lies in his creative development of the theories of V.I. Lenin and J.V. Stalin on changing the nature of revolution in colonial and dependent countries in the era of the collapse of imperialism and the victory of socialism, and in his elucidation of the content of revolutionary regimes and political systems arising in this revolutionary process.

    In his works such as "On New Democracy" and "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," Mao Zedong said that the victory of the October Socialist Revolution changed the entire course of world history and opened a new era in human development. The era of world socialist revolution began. Therefore, the struggle against imperialism, against reactionary forces, against colonial oppression and feudal remnants is part of the world socialist liberation movement, and the revolutionary struggle of the colonies is the ally of the world socialist revolutionary front.

    Mao Zedong pointed out that before the victory of the October Revolution, bourgeois democratic revolutions belonged to the category of old bourgeois democratic revolutions, which were part of the old world bourgeois democratic revolution. The victory of this revolution meant the establishment of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and the creation of greater possibilities for the development of capitalism in colonial and semi-colonial countries.

    After 1917, the situation fundamentally changed. In colonial and semi-colonial countries, the first stage of the revolution, in terms of its social nature, was still a bourgeois democratic revolution, and objectively it cleared the way for the development of capitalism. However, this revolution was no longer led by the bourgeoisie, and was no longer the old bourgeois democratic revolution that led to the establishment of bourgeois rule. Instead, it was a new democratic revolution, led by the proletariat, with the aim of establishing a new type of democratic state with the joint dictatorship of the various revolutionary classes headed by the working class in the current stage of the revolution. Therefore, this revolution was a blow to imperialism, and imperialism opposed it. This revolution cleared the way for the development of socialism, so the entire socialist force in the world supported this revolution. Therefore, although this revolution is still a general democratic revolution in its first stage, it is a part of the world socialist revolution.

    Mao Zedong wrote: "The first stage of this Chinese revolution (which is divided into many small stages), in its social nature, is a new type of bourgeois democratic revolution, not yet a proletarian socialist revolution, but it has long become a part of the proletarian socialist world revolution, and now it has become a great part of this world revolution, a great ally of this world revolution."

    The victory of the democratic revolution led by the working class does not lead to the establishment of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, but to the establishment of a new democratic system and a revolutionary people's regime. Mao Zedong wrote: "The dictatorship of all revolutionary classes over the counter-revolutionary traitors, this is the country we want now."

    In the economic field, the people's regime will implement large-scale socio-economic transformations, such as: eliminating feudal relations throughout the country and implementing land reform according to the principle of "land to the tillers," nationalizing large banks, railways, and large-scale industry and commerce, etc. The socio-economic measures of the people's regime are anti-imperialist and anti-feudal, but they do not eliminate capitalism at this stage, only restrict the development of capitalism. Mao Zedong pointed out that in the republic led by the proletariat, state-owned components are socialist in nature. That is to say, this revolution is a general democratic revolution, but it must include some socialist elements.

    Gradually implementing general democratic measures is to prepare all the necessary conditions for moving to the next stage, the stage of socialist revolution. The Chinese people's national culture plays a major role in building a new democratic China. Therefore, Mao Zedong attached great importance to the issue of cultural development. In his work "On New Democracy," Mao Zedong wrote: "We Communists have struggled for many years not only for the political revolution and economic revolution of China, but also for the cultural revolution of China; the purpose of all these is to build a new society and a new country for the Chinese nation. In this new society and new country, there will be not only a new politics and a new economy, but also a new culture."

    Mao Zedong pointed out that China, in its long history, created a rich culture. The Chinese people, in their history of civilization, had well-developed agriculture and handicrafts, many great thinkers, scientists, inventors, politicians, military strategists, writers, and artists, and a wealth of cultural classics. In the very early days, China had the invention of the compass. Papermaking was invented 1,800 years ago, and block printing was invented 1,300 years ago. Movable type printing was invented 800 years ago. Gunpowder was also first used by the Chinese. China has about four thousand years of recorded history. Mao Zedong pointed out that clearing up the development process of ancient culture, removing its feudal dross, and absorbing its democratic essence are necessary conditions for developing a new national culture and improving national self-confidence. It is necessary to distinguish between all the decadent things of the ancient feudal ruling class and the excellent ancient people's culture, that is, things that are somewhat democratic and revolutionary.

    Mao Zedong closely combined the process of social struggle and revolutionary movement in China to study the cultural development of the Chinese nation, and he specifically determined the content and nature of the new culture of the Chinese nation. The author pointed out that the culture of democratic China is a national culture. It is opposed to imperialist oppression, and safeguards the dignity and independence of the Chinese nation. It is our nation's, and carries our nation's characteristics. It unites with all other nations' socialist cultures and new democratic cultures, establishes a relationship of mutual absorption and mutual development, and jointly forms a new culture of the world.

    While putting forward the task of establishing a democratic China, the Chinese Communist Party actively struggled to establish the national culture of the Chinese people. Based on Mao Zedong's theories on the strategy and tactics of the Chinese revolution and on the construction of a new democratic China, the Chinese Communist Party launched the people to carry out a heroic struggle for national independence and democracy, and finally led the people to victory. The Chinese people have forever escaped the oppression of imperialism and feudal landlords, and established a strong and independent people's democratic state - the People's Republic of China.

    (III)

    In its heroic struggle, the Chinese Communist Party has always received the sympathy and support of all revolutionary forces in the world, and it has always adhered to the principles of proletarian internationalism. The idea of ​​the unbreakable and long-lasting friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China is vividly expressed in Mao Zedong's works.

    In articles such as "The Consistency of Soviet Interests and Human Interests," "A Talk with a New China Daily Reporter on the New International Situation," and "Stalin is a Friend of the Chinese People," Mao Zedong comprehensively elucidated various issues of Soviet policy, elucidated the Soviet Union's tireless struggle to maintain peace and security, and elucidated the Soviet Union's selfless assistance and support to the anti-Japanese Chinese people. In these articles, the author compared the imperialist bandits' policy of plundering China with the Soviet Union's consistently friendly and equal attitude toward China. Mao Zedong pointed out in the article "The Consistency of Soviet Interests and Human Interests" that the interests of the Soviet Union and the interests of Chinese national liberation will never conflict with each other, but will always be consistent. Mao Zedong said: "The Soviet Union is the first major force in the world, and it will definitely help China fight the War of Resistance to the end."

    Reality itself is the best proof of Mao Zedong's judgments. The Soviet Union has always been and still is the most reliable friend of the Chinese people. The selfless struggle of the people of China and the Soviet Union and their allies guaranteed the victory over Japanese imperialism and made it possible to establish peace in the Far East. The increasingly consolidated fraternal alliance between the Soviet Union and China clearly shows that the great friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China is solid and unbreakable.

    The works in Volume III of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" are brilliant examples of the creative application of the general principles of Marxism-Leninism under the specific historical conditions of China, the close combination of Marxist-Leninist theory and China's revolutionary practice, and valuable additions to Marxist science.

    In his works, Mao Zedong tirelessly taught the Chinese Communist Party to follow the invincible doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin in all practical activities. Mao Zedong's works once again prove to the world how vital the ideas of Marxism-Leninism are. Mao Zedong's works will be of great help to the fraternal Communist Parties, and will be of even greater help to the fraternal Communist Parties of colonial and dependent countries in their struggle for national independence and democratic freedom, in planning revolutionary strategy and tactics, and in establishing democratic systems.

    “毛泽东选集”第三卷
     苏联  费德林
    “毛泽东选集”俄文版第三卷已经出版了。俄文版第三卷包括毛泽东从一九三九年五月到一九四
    一年五月期间所写的著作。这一时期是中国人民为了自己的民族解放和社会解放而进行英勇斗争的重大紧要的关头。大家知道，由于蒋介石集团的卖国政策，国民党军队遭到了一连串的惨重失败，使大片国土沦陷到敌人日本军国主义者的手中，其中包括北京、天津、上海、南京、汉口、广州、长沙等这样一些具有战略价值的大城市和大工业中心。到一九三八年年底，国民党军队实际上停止了积极的军事行动。
    共产党创立的人民军队是和日寇进行积极斗争的一支强大力量。到一九四○年，即在抗日战争头三年内，人民军队的人数已由四万人发展到约五十万人。解放区和游击区的人口将近一亿。共产党领导的人民的爱国武装力量的迅速壮大，敌后游击战争的广泛开展，强大而坚固的民主根据地的建立，改变了战争的进程。
    在人民武装力量的猛烈打击下，日本军队便不能进行大规模的进攻。日本司令部利用国民党军队的无所作为，便集中主要力量来打击中国共产党所领导的人民军队：八路军、新四军和游击部队。
    与集中力量进攻人民军队同时，日本帝国主义对国民党采取了所谓“政治攻势”。这种政治手段的目的，在于分裂抗日民族统一战线，并以虚伪的让步换取蒋介石的投降，以便假中国反动势力之手镇压人民军队。这时，以卖国贼汪精卫为首的一部分买办资产阶级、封建地主、军阀和国民党政客投奔了日本侵略阵营，和日本签订了卖国条约，把中国的大片国土拱手交给日寇作为他们的殖民地。
    以蒋介石国民党集团为首的另一部分买办资产阶级、大地主和军阀等顽固派，虽然在形式上参加了抗日民族统一战线，但实际上却在干着破坏统一战线的勾当。国民党重新以恐怖和镇压政策对付民主力量，对付共产党。一九三九年六月，国民党在平江对当地新四军通讯处的工作人员进行了血腥的镇压。一九四一年一月，国民党的大量军队开始采取军事行动来消灭驻扎安徽省的新四军部队，并进攻该军的司令部。
    在中国其他地区，也开始对人民军队进行军事挑衅。在蒋介石的命令下，国民党军队开始对八路军中央根据地——陕甘宁边区实行封锁。顽固派投降和统一战线分裂的趋势，在国民党的政策中，日见明显。英美帝国主义也不惜牺牲中华民族的根本利益，企图和日本军国主义相勾结，策划新的“东方慕尼黑”阴谋。这就使得中国的局势复杂起来。
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东在“毛泽东选集”俄文版第三卷所收集的著作中，对中国共产党在这个时期的政治路线、战略和策略作了理论上的分析，确定了战胜帝国主义和封建势力的前途和道路，深刻而全面地策划了建设民主的新中国的问题。
    （一）
    在这个时期中，中国整个政治生活中的最重大的问题是：如何争取民族独立和民主自由，如何战胜日本帝国主义，如何扩大并加强抗日民族统一战线，而抗日民族统一战线是解决当时迫切的历史任务的主要条件。
    毛泽东在研究共产党在中国解放运动这一阶段中的政治战略和策略问题时，首先对中国社会的基本矛盾作了深刻的、马克思主义的分析，仔细地研究了日益发展的革命的实质和特点。毛泽东创造性地运用马克思主义理论分析了中国历史发展的具体问题。他在“中国革命和中国共产党”、“新民主主义论”等著作中，对中国怎样由一个封建国家变成半封建、半殖民地国家的问题，作了深刻的科学分析。
    侵入中国的外国帝国主义利用封建残余来压迫和掠夺中国人民，尽力阻遏中国经济的发展，结果使中国不断削弱。日本侵略者利用处于帝国主义和封建主义双重压迫下的中国的弱点，妄想奴役整个中国，把中国变成他们的殖民地。这一切就决定了中国社会的深刻矛盾。毛泽东在“中国革命和中国共产党”一文中说：“帝国主义和中华民族的矛盾，封建主义和人民大众的矛盾，这些就是近代中国社会的主要的矛盾。当然还有别的矛盾，例如资产阶级和无产阶级的矛盾，反动统治阶级内部的矛盾。而帝国主义和中华民族的矛盾，乃是各种矛盾中的最主要的矛盾……伟大的近代和现代的中国革命，是在这些基本矛盾的基础上发生和发展起来的。”
    革命的任务就是要消灭帝国主义统治，铲除封建主义。毛泽东指出，这就是反帝反封建革命的方针，而反对帝国主义压迫、争取民族自由和独立的斗争，就具有头等重要的意义。在第三卷的著作所涉及的时期中，最重要的政治任务就是粉碎企图奴役整个中国的日本侵略者，这个任务决定了其他一切问题，例如主要的打击对象、党的策略、斗争形式和方法等。
    毛泽东根据马克思列宁主义的策略原则，根据中国抗日民族解放斗争时期的特点，论证并制定了中国工人阶级及其政党共产党对待各种不同社会集团的策略。他指出，中国革命的主要动力和领导力量是无产阶级，无产阶级虽然人数不多而且年轻，但是，在政治斗争的舞台上，它却是中国社会最有组织性、最有觉悟和最有决定意义的阶级。农民，首先是贫农和中农是切身地关心消灭封建制度和它的支持者帝国主义的。因此，农民是工人阶级在争取民族独立和民主自由的斗争中、在争取向前发展的斗争中最坚决和始终不渝的同盟者。毛泽东指出，占中国农村人口百分之七十的贫农和雇农是
    “中国革命的最广大的动力，是无产阶级的天然的和最可靠的同盟者，是中国革命队伍的主力军”。
    城市小资产阶级也是无产阶级的同盟者和重要的革命动力之一，因为小资产阶级只有在工人阶级的领导下，才能得到解放。深受帝国主义压迫和封建主义束缚的民族资产阶级也是革命力量之一，虽然它是不可靠的和动摇的力量。在抗日战争时期，形成了把民族资产阶级吸引到统一战线内的有利环境。毛泽东提出了加强联合民族资产阶级的统一战线的任务。
    毛泽东提出并论证了关于在抗日战争中有可能利用买办资产阶级某些部分的理论，对于中国人民反对日本侵略的斗争有着重要的意义。这种可能的根据是：支持各个买办资产阶级集团的是彼此斗争的各个帝国主义国家。毛泽东指出：“在这种一定的时期内，中国无产阶级为了削弱敌人和加强自己的后备力量，可以同这样的大资产阶级集团建立可能的统一战线，并在有利于革命的一定条件下尽可能地保持之。”
    中国共产党积极努力争取全国一切可能争取到的力量参加抗日民族统一战线，共同抵抗侵略者。共产党认为，民族统一战线是拯救中国摆脱日本奴役的唯一方法，因此一贯为统一战线的扩大和加强进行坚强的斗争。
    在这个时期，加强抗日民族统一战线的问题是极其尖锐的和极其迫切的问题，因为，当时国民党集团已显然动摇起来，企图和日本侵略者勾结，并向他们投降。毛泽东在“反对投降活动”、“必须制裁反动派”、“目前形势和党的任务”、“克服投降危险，力争时局好转”等著作中，揭穿国民党反动派企图勾结日本帝国主义及在中国发动罪恶的内战，并无情地鞭笞投降分子，详细地论证了保持和加强统一战线的重要性。
    毛泽东在“反对投降活动”一文中写道：“用全民族的血肉和日本帝国主义打了两个周年的战争，决不容许一部分人的动摇和叛卖。用全民族的努力所结成的抗日民族统一战线，决不容许一部分人的破坏和分裂。战下去，团结下去，——中国必存。和下去，分裂下去，——中国必亡。”中国共产党清楚地认识到：投降会招致民族灾难，因此号召动员中国社会的一切进步力量为反对日本帝国主义、反对卖国贼和投降分子而斗争，为拯救祖国、争取民族独立和自由而斗争。
    在加强巩固抗日民族统一战线的同时，要克服有害的、错误的“左”倾关门主义和右倾机会主义的倾向。“左”倾关门主义没有认识到中国资产阶级的地位和资本主义国家资产阶级的地位的区别，反对和中国资产阶级结成联盟，这就使抗日力量有削弱的危险。与此相反，右倾机会主义没有认识到无产阶级和资产阶级在纲领、政策和实践上有着根本的区别。毛泽东在为“共产党人”杂志而作的发刊词中，批评了这两种倾向。依据中国共产党的倡议而建立的抗日民族统一战线，在中国革命的发展中起了显著的作用。
    中国革命发展的重要特点，中国整个政治生活的重大因素是武装斗争。中国共产党为人民的自由而进行的多年斗争的经验证明，武装斗争是革命发展的主要形式，离开了武装斗争，中国革命就不可能胜利。毛泽东的功绩在于：他阐明了中国民族解放斗争的特点，指出了中国人民在这个斗争中有着不断增长的和不断加强的武装力量，这个因素对于革命的胜利有着决定性的意义。他写道：“中国共产党的武装斗争，就是在无产阶级领导之下的农民战争。”
    毛泽东把抗日民族统一战线的建立和加强、武装斗争的扩大跟共产党队伍的壮大和它的战斗力的提高，紧密结合在一起，加以研究。正如毛泽东所指出，这是共产党成为坚强地领导国内一切民主力量的全国性的大党的时期。它的任务是：要更加从思想上、组织上和政治上锻炼党，要加强党和人民的密切联系，并在始终不渝地执行统一战线政策的基础上，坚决展开武装斗争，领导人民走向胜利。随后一段时期的历史事件证明，毛泽东在革命的性质和动力方面，在共产党的战略和策略以及斗争的形式和方法方面所作的指示，是有着何等伟大的生命力，是如何的正确。
    （二）
    毛泽东对马克思列宁主义理论的重大贡献，在于他创造性地发展了乌·伊·列宁和约·维·斯大林关于在帝国主义崩溃和社会主义胜利时代改变殖民地附属国的革命性质的理论，在于他阐明了在这个革命过程中所产生的革命政权和政治制度的内容问题。
    毛泽东在他的“新民主主义论”、“中国革命和中国共产党”等著作中说，十月社会主义革命的胜利改变了整个世界历史的进程，开辟了人类发展的新纪元。世界社会主义革命的时代开始了。因此，反对帝国主义、反对反动势力、反对殖民压迫和封建残余的斗争，是世界社会主义解放运动的一部分，而殖民地的革命斗争则是世界社会主义革命战线的同盟军。
    毛泽东指出，十月革命胜利以前，资产阶级民主主义革命属于旧的资产阶级民主主义革命的范畴，它是旧的世界资产阶级民主主义革命的一部分。这种革命的胜利便是资产阶级专政的建立和在殖民地和半殖民地国家中造成发展资本主义的更大可能性。
    一九一七年以后，形势根本改变了。在殖民地半殖民地国家，革命的第一阶段，就其社会性质说，虽然还是资产阶级民主主义革命，在客观上它为发展资本主义扫清道路，但是这种革命已不是由资产阶级所领导，和导致资产阶级统治的建立的旧资产阶级民主主义革命，而是新民主主义革命，它是由无产阶级领导，目的在于在革命现阶段建立一个以工人阶级为首的各个革命阶级联合专政的新式民主国家。因此，这种革命是对帝国主义的打击，而帝国主义就反对这种革命。这种革命是为发展社会主义扫清道路，因而全世界整个社会主义力量也就支持这种革命。所以，尽管这种革命在它的第一阶段还是一般的民主主义革命，然而却是世界社会主义革命的一部分。
    毛泽东写道：“这个中国革命的第一阶段（其中又分为许多小阶段），其社会性质是新式的资产阶级民主主义的革命，还不是无产阶级社会主义的革命，但早已成了无产阶级社会主义的世界革命的一部分，现在则更成了这种世界革命的伟大的一部分，成了这种世界革命的伟大的同盟军。”
    工人阶级领导的民主主义革命的胜利，不是建立资产阶级专政，而是建立新民主主义制度，建立革命的人民政权。毛泽东写道：“一切革命的阶级对于反革命汉奸们的专政，这就是我们现在所要的国家。”
    在经济方面，人民政权要实行大规模的社会经济改造，如：在全国范围内消灭封建关系和按照“耕者有其田”的原则实行土地改革，把大银行、铁路、大工商业收归国有等等。人民政权的社会经济措施是反对帝国主义和封建主义的，但它在现阶段并不消灭资本主义，只是限制资本主义的发展。毛泽东指出，在无产阶级所领导的共和国中，国营成分按其性质来说是社会主义的。这就是说，这个革命是一般的民主主义革命，但它一定包括一些社会主义的因素。
    逐步实行一般的民主措施，是为转入下一阶段，转入社会主义革命阶段准备一切必要的条件。中国人民的民族文化，对建设新民主主义的中国起着重大的作用，因此，毛泽东很重视文化发展的问题。毛泽东在“新民主主义论”这一著作中写道：“我们共产党人，多年以来，不但为中国的政治革命和经济革命而奋斗，而且为中国文化的革命而奋斗；一切这些的目的，在于建设一个中华民族的新社会和新国家。在这个新社会和新国家中，不但有新政治、新经济、而且有新文化。”
    毛泽东指出，中国在它的悠久的历史中，创建了丰富的文化。中国人民在他们的开化史上，有素称发达的农业和手工业，有许多伟大的思想家、科学家、发明家、政治家、军事家、文学家、艺术家，有丰富的文化典籍。在很早的时候，中国就有了指南针的发明，在一千八百年前已经发明了造纸法，一千三百年前，已经发明了刻版印刷。在八百年前，更发明了活字印刷。火药也是中国人首先使用的。有文字记载可考的中国历史约有四千年。毛泽东指出，清理古代文化的发展过程，剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华，是发展民族新文化提高民族自信心的必要条件。必须将古代封建统治阶级一切腐朽的东西和古代优秀的人民文化即多少带有民主性和革命性的东西区别开来。
    毛泽东密切结合中国社会斗争及革命运动的过程，研究了中华民族的文化发展，他具体确定了中华民族新文化的内容和性质。作者指出，民主中国的文化是民族文化。它是反对帝国主义压迫，维护中华民族的尊严和独立的。它是我们这个民族的，带有我们民族的特性。它同一切别的民族的社会主义文化和新民主主义文化相联合，建立互相吸收和互相发展的关系，共同形成世界的新文化。
    中国共产党与提出建立民主中国的任务的同时，就积极地为建立中国人民的民族文化而奋斗。中国共产党依据毛泽东在中国革命的战略策略方面和在新民主主义中国的建设方面的理论，发动了人民群众为民族独立和民主而进行英勇的斗争，终于领导人民取得了胜利。中国人民永远摆脱了帝国主义和封建地主的压迫，建立了强大的独立的人民民主的国家——中华人民共和国。
    （三）
    中国共产党在其英勇的斗争中始终得到世界一切革命力量的同情和支持，它始终遵循着无产阶级国际主义的原则。在毛泽东的著作中鲜明地表现出苏中两国人民之间牢不可破的悠久友谊的思想。
    毛泽东在“苏联利益和人类利益的一致”、“关于国际新形势对新华日报记者的谈话”、“斯大林是中国人民的朋友”等文章中，全面地阐明了苏联政策的各种问题，阐明了苏联不倦地为维护和平与安全所进行的斗争，阐明了苏联对抗日的中国人民的无私的援助和支持。作者在这些文章中把帝国主义强盗掳掠中国的政策与苏联对待中国一贯友好平等的态度作了对比。毛泽东在“苏联利益和人类利益的一致”这篇文章中指出，苏联的利益和中国民族解放的利益决不会互相冲突，而将是永久互相一致。毛泽东说：“苏联是世界上第一个大力量，它是决然帮助中国抗战到底的。”
    现实本身就是毛泽东的这些论断的最好的凭证。苏联过去一向是、现在仍然是中国人民的最可靠的朋友。中苏两国人民及其同盟者的忘我的奋斗保证了战胜日本帝国主义，使得有可能建立远东和平。日益巩固的苏中兄弟联盟明显地表明，苏中两国人民伟大友谊是稳固的和牢不可破的。
    “毛泽东选集”第三卷的著作是在中国具体历史条件下创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的一般原理，把马克思列宁主义理论与中国的革命实践密切结合，以及对马克思主义科学作了有价值的补充的光辉范例。
    毛泽东在他的著作中不倦地教导中国共产党人在一切的实际活动中要遵循战无不胜的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说。毛泽东的著作再一次向全世界证明，马克思列宁主义思想是具有何等的生命力。毛泽东的著作对兄弟共产党将有很大的帮助，而对殖民地附属国的兄弟共产党在它们争取民族独立和民主自由方面，在策划革命的战略策略方面，在建立民主制度方面将有更大的帮助。
