Strengthening Party Organization Leadership in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign

Increasing production, practicing strict economy, and striving to overfulfill this year's national plan are the pressing tasks of the enterprise sector. Party organizations in enterprises have the responsibility to supervise the victorious completion of this task. Party organizations in enterprises should not only call on and urge all Communist Party members to model and overfulfill their own tasks; strengthen the Party's political work so that all employees fully recognize the great political and economic significance of overfulfilling the national plan and the conditions for overfulfilling the plan, thereby throwing themselves into the increase production and practice economy campaign with full confidence; at the same time, they must also strengthen the political and ideological leadership of the increase production and practice economy campaign and supervise all enterprises to successfully complete or overfulfill their own increase production and practice economy plans.

Party organizations must frequently and deeply publicize the Party's guiding principles and policies for increasing production and practicing economy, so that every employee can master the Party's guiding principles and policies and consciously and actively implement them. When mobilizing for increased production and practicing economy, the Party committees and Party organizations of factories and mines in various places have clearly explained the Party's guiding principles and policies for increasing production and practicing economy to the factories and mines and all employees, requiring the factories and mines and all employees to not only increase production but also improve quality and reduce costs to comprehensively and evenly complete the national plan. Therefore, when looking for clever methods, tapping potential, and launching the increase production and practice economy campaign, it is necessary to combine this with improving business management, instead of disrupting the original work arrangements, or departing from the correct methods of improving business management and promoting advanced experiences, and simply and hastily organizing the competition using the erroneous method of working overtime and rushing production. Otherwise, it will not only fail to achieve the purpose of the increase production and practice economy campaign but will also cause waste. Many factories and mines' Party organizations not only made general mobilizations but also mobilized employees to cooperate with the administration to inspect the implementation of the plan in the past few months. Based on the problems discovered, the Party organizations formulated their own work plans. After analyzing the production situation in the first half of the year, the Party organization of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant identified two key issues that must be resolved to strengthen plan management—reducing defective products and reducing intermittent working hours—and formulated an increase production and practice economy plan. The Party organization of the Shenyang Plumbing Equipment Plant also put forward the goal of the competition in the plant as "improving product quality, saving raw materials, and reducing costs" based on the Party's guiding principles and the situation of local state-owned enterprises characterized by "low quality, high costs, and large waste." However, there are still a few units where the Party organizations have not deeply publicized the Party's guiding principles and policies for increasing production and practicing economy, and supervised the administration and all employees to formulate correct increase production and practice economy plans. For example, individual textile factories in Wuhan City are not using the method of strengthening technical management to reduce yarn breakage, reduce machine downtime, and reduce waste cotton to achieve the goal of increasing production and reducing costs, but are preparing to increase production by increasing machine speed and working overtime, and reduce raw cotton consumption and reduce costs by mixing in waste cotton. This is wrong and must be corrected.

Party organizations in enterprises must strive to study the Party's guiding principles and policies for increasing production and practicing economy and be familiar with the business. If the Party organization cannot correctly understand the Party's guiding principles and policies for increasing production and practicing economy and is not familiar with the business of its own enterprise, it cannot represent the Party to supervise the correct implementation of these guiding principles in the factories and mines where it is located, and may even organize and mobilize the masses to work overtime like some factories and mines did in the past. At the same time, the Party organization must also oppose liberal tendencies. In the past, although a few Party organizations knew the harm of tendencies such as rushing production to national construction, they were afraid that after raising opinions to the administration, they would be accused of "creating trouble" and "being disunited," so they adopted a liberal attitude towards these erroneous behaviors. In this year's increase production and practice economy campaign, Party organizations must adhere to principles and use the method of persuasion and education to correct all erroneous ideas and behaviors that deviate from the Party's policies and guiding principles.

Establishing advanced ideas, discovering advanced figures, overcoming conservative and backward ideas, and promoting the increase production and practice economy campaign are important contents of the Party organization's political work in the increase production and practice economy campaign. Comrade Stalin once pointed out: "Socialist competition is: some people work poorly, others work well, and still others work even better—to catch up with the better ones and achieve a general upsurge." ("Mass Competition and the Upsurge of Labor Enthusiasm" published on page 3 of this newspaper on May 1, 1953) In the increase production and practice economy campaign, the Party organization must constantly discover and cultivate people who work better, and use these better people to promote people who work generally and people who work poorly. The Northeast "May 3" Factory did this, and immediately achieved results. When the second workshop of the factory launched a discussion among the masses on how to prevent the machine from dropping the belt in order to improve labor productivity and equipment utilization, some people thought that it was impossible to prevent the belt from dropping. During the discussion, the leadership discovered that the Yang Zhongshu mutual aid group had the fewest number of belt drops. Therefore, they launched everyone to discuss the operating methods of the Yang Zhongshu mutual aid group, and organized everyone to learn their operating methods. The next day, the number of belt drops in this section was greatly reduced. The work that originally required seventeen machines could now be done with only fifteen machines. Therefore, the Party organization must be good at discovering advanced ideas and advanced figures among the Party and non-Party masses. In carrying out this work, the Party organization must first pay attention to giving play to the vanguard role of Communist Party members in production. Lenin said: "Party members should become models for everyone in observing labor discipline and working hard." In the past, many Communist Party members have made outstanding creations on the production front and become role models for the broad masses to learn from. In this year's increase production and practice economy campaign, the Party organization should cultivate more Communist Party members to become advanced figures leading the masses forward. On the other hand, the Party organization must constantly fight against all conservative and backward ideas. Without overcoming conservative and backward ideas, advanced ideas cannot fully play their role, and the increase production and practice economy campaign cannot be carried out smoothly. This year, at the beginning of the increase production and practice economy campaign, many Party organizations paid attention to criticizing conservative ideas and commending advanced increase production and practice economy plans, which is good. Only in this way can the competition be launched quickly. However, it must be pointed out that in some enterprises, conservative sentiments are still an obstacle to carrying out the increase production and practice economy campaign. The Party organization must continue to criticize conservative ideas. In addition, it should also be estimated that new weak links and negative factors affecting the realization of the plan will continue to emerge in the process of implementing the plan. Some people may develop negative and conservative emotions in the face of difficulties. The Party organization should not only criticize this kind of ideological emotion but also organize the masses to purposefully find clever methods and put forward rationalization proposals to overcome difficulties in work. When the plan is being implemented smoothly, the Party organization should also pay attention to preventing the breeding of complacency and slack emotions, and put forward the slogan of continuing to move forward, and strive to overfulfill the plan more. Only in this way can it be guaranteed that the increase production and practice economy campaign will always move forward under the leadership of advanced ideas.

In the increase production and practice economy campaign, the Party organization must continuously educate the workers on labor discipline, which is one of the important conditions for ensuring the smooth progress of the increase production and practice economy campaign. In recent months, most factories and mines have educated the masses on labor discipline and have achieved good results. However, educating workers on labor discipline is a long-term task, and it must not be thought that the problem of labor discipline will be solved with a single education. In the increase production and practice economy campaign, it is especially necessary to educate workers to ensure attendance, strictly abide by operating procedures, and strive to improve labor efficiency. Labor discipline education should also be strengthened among staff and technicians to correct various individualistic and departmental work styles such as those who dare not or are unwilling to take responsibility, and who act independently and do not cooperate with each other, to ensure the implementation of the operating plan. The Party organization also needs to accept past experiences, prevent the breeding of bad work styles such as championism, showing off, and fraud in the competition process, and ensure the healthy development of the competition.

To strengthen the leadership of the Party organization in the increase production and practice economy campaign, the Party organization should adapt to some new situations in the work of the enterprise to develop its own leadership methods and working methods. Party organizations in enterprises already have a set of experiences in mobilizing the masses politically. However, this is not enough. It is also necessary to closely combine political work with economic work, that is, the Party's political and ideological leadership must be integrated into all aspects of each enterprise's production activities. Some factories and mines' Party organizations have not paid attention to the new situation and are still following the old methods, proposing "checking the progress of the competition once a month," which is obviously not enough. In addition to conducting necessary key inspections to solve certain key problems, the Party organization must also closely cooperate with the administrative organization, carefully analyze the reports of the dispatching organization, planning organization, inspection organization, financial organization, and supply and marketing organization, comprehensively grasp the situation of the enterprise's production plan, cost, quality, financial and other activities, timely discover problems, and put forward suggestions for solving them. The work of various departments of the Party organization, such as organization work and propaganda work, must also be closely combined with the increase production and practice economy work, changing the past practice in some Party organizations where propaganda work isolatedly talked about Party knowledge, and the organization department isolatedly built the Party and cultivated activists.

### 加强党组织对增产节约竞赛的领导

    加强党组织对增产节约竞赛的领导
    增加生产、厉行节约，争取超额完成今年国家计划，这是企业部门当前的紧迫任务。企业中的党组织有责任来监督这一任务的胜利完成。企业中的党组织不但应该号召和督促所有的共产党员模范地超额完成自己的任务；加强党的政治工作，使全体职工充分认识到超额完成国家计划的伟大的政治意义和经济意义以及超额完成计划的条件，从而满怀信心地投入增产节约竞赛；同时，还必须加强对增产节约竞赛的政治思想领导，监督各个企业都能顺利地完成或超额完成自己的增产节约计划。
    党组织要经常地深入宣传党的增产节约的方针政策，使每个职工都能掌握党的方针政策而自觉地积极地去贯彻执行。各地党委与厂矿的党组织在进行增产节约动员时都已明确地向各厂矿与全体职工交代了党的增产节约政策方针，要求各厂矿与全体职工不但要增加产量，而且必须提高质量降低成本，全面地均衡地完成国家计划。因此，在寻找窍门挖掘潜力开展增产节约竞赛时，就要与改善经营管理相结合，而不应打乱原来的工作部署，也不能离开改善经营管理和推广先进经验的正确办法，而简单草率地用加班加点突击生产的错误办法去组织竞赛。否则，不但不能达到增产节约竞赛的目的，反而会造成浪费。许多厂矿的党组织不仅作了一般的动员，而且发动职工配合行政检查了过去几个月的计划执行情况，党组织根据所发现的问题，制订了自己的工作计划。沈阳机床三厂的党组织在分析了上半年的生产情况，找出了加强计划管理必须解决的两个关键问题——减少废品，减少间断工时后，制订了增产节约计划。沈阳水暖器材一厂的党组织也根据党的方针和地方国营企业“质量低、成本高、浪费大”的情况，提出以“提高产品质量、节约原材料、降低成本”为该厂竞赛的目标。但是，也还有少数单位的党组织没有深入地宣传党的增产节约的方针政策，并监督行政和全体职工制订出正确的增产节约计划。武汉市就有个别纺织厂不是用加强技术管理的办法去减少断头，减少机器停歇时间，减少废棉，以达到增加产量降低成本的目的，而是准备用加快机器转速和加班的办法来增产，用掺废棉的办法减少原棉消耗，降低成本。这是错误的，必须纠正。
    企业中的党组织必须努力学习党的增产节约的方针政策和熟悉业务。党组织如果不能正确地理解党的增产节约的方针政策，不熟悉自己企业的业务，就不能代表党监督所在厂矿正确地贯彻这些方针，甚至会像过去有些厂矿一样去组织动员群众加班加点。党组织同时也要反对自由主义倾向。过去，有少数党组织虽然知道突击生产等偏向对国家建设的危害，但是，他们害怕向行政方面提出意见后，会被别人指责为“闹关系”“不团结”，因而就采取自由主义态度来对待这些错误行为。在今年的增产节约竞赛中，党组织必须坚持原则，用说服教育的办法纠正一切离开党的政策方针的错误思想和错误行为。
    树立先进思想，发现先进人物，克服保守落后思想，推动增产节约竞赛，是党组织在增产节约竞赛中政治工作的重要内容。斯大林同志曾指出：“社会主义竞赛是：一些人工作得不好，另外一些人工作得好，再有一些人工作得更好，——要赶上更好的并要达到普遍的高涨。”（“群众的竞赛和劳动热情的高涨”载一九五三年五月一日本报三版）党组织在增产节约竞赛中，就要这样时时刻刻地去发现与培养工作得更好的人，用这些更好的人去推动工作得一般的人和工作得不好的人。东北“五三”工厂这样做了，立即就收到了效果。该厂第二车间在某一工段发动群众讨论如何使机器不掉皮带以提高劳动生产率和设备利用率时，有些人却认为不掉皮带是不可能的事。在讨论中，领导方面发现了杨仲竖互助组掉皮带的次数最少。于是，便发动大家讨论杨仲竖互助组的操作方法，并组织大家学习他们的操作法。第二天，这个工段掉皮带的次数就大大减少。原来要用十七台机器干的活，这时只要十五台就行了。因此，党组织要善于发现党与非党群众中的先进思想和先进人物。在进行这一工作中，党组织首先要注意发挥共产党员在生产中的先锋作用。列宁说：“党员在遵守劳动纪律和努力工作方面应当成为一切人的模范。”过去，已有许多共产党员在生产战线上有了出色的创造，成为广大群众学习的榜样。在今年的增产节约竞赛中，党组织应该培养更多的共产党员成为带领群众前进的先进人物。另一方面，党组织必须经常和一切保守落后的思想进行斗争。不克服保守落后思想，先进思想就不能充分发挥它的作用，增产节约竞赛就不能顺利地开展。今年，增产节约竞赛一开始，许多党组织就注意了批判保守思想，表扬了先进的增产节约计划，这是好的，只有这样，竞赛才能迅速展开。但是，必须指出，在有些企业中，保守情绪依然是开展增产节约竞赛的一个障碍。党组织必须对保守思想继续进行批判。此外，还应该估计到，在执行计划过程中，会不断出现新的薄弱环节和影响计划实现的消极因素。可能有些人在困难面前会产生消极保守的情绪，党组织不仅要批判这种思想情绪，还要组织群众有目的地找窍门提合理化建议，克服工作中的困难。在计划执行顺利时，党组织也要注意防止自满松懈情绪的滋生，并且提出继续前进的口号，争取更多地超额完成计划。这样才能保证增产节约竞赛在先进思想领导之下，永远前进。
    在增产节约竞赛中，党组织要不断地对工人进行劳动纪律教育，这是保证增产节约竞赛顺利进行的重要条件之一。近几个月来，大多数的厂矿都对群众进行了劳动纪律的教育，并且收到了很好的效果。但是，对工人进行劳动纪律教育是一个长期的工作，决不能以为教育一下，劳动纪律的问题就解决了。在增产节约竞赛中，尤需教育工人保证出勤，严格遵守操作规程，努力提高劳动效率。在职员和技术人员中同样应该加强劳动纪律教育，纠正那些不敢负责或不愿负责，各自为政互不配合等各种个人主义和本位主义的思想作风，保证作业计划的贯彻执行。党组织还需要接受过去的经验，在竞赛过程中防止那些锦标主义、风头主义以及弄虚作假等不良作风的滋生，保证竞赛健康地发展。
    党组织要加强对增产节约竞赛的领导，应该适应企业工作的一些新情况来使自己的领导方法和工作方法有所发展。企业中的党组织已经有了一套从政治上动员群众的经验。但是，这是不够的，还必须把政治工作和经济工作紧密结合起来，就是必须把党的政治思想领导贯穿到每个企业生产活动的各个方面去。有些厂矿的党组织，没有注意到新的情况，仍然按照老一套的办法，提出“一个月检查一次竞赛进展的情况”，这显然是不够的。党组织除了为解决某些关键问题要进行必要的重点检查外，还必须经常地同行政组织密切配合，仔细分析调度机构、计划机构、检查机构、财务机构、供销机构等方面的汇报，全面地掌握企业生产计划、成本、质量、财务等活动的情况，及时地发现问题，提出解决的意见，党组织的各个部门工作如组织工作宣传工作也必须和增产节约工作密切结合起来，改变过去有些党组织中宣传工作孤立讲党的知识，组织部门孤立建党和培养积极分子的作法。
