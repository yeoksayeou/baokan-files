Xinhua News Agency Report: The No. 4 electric furnace of the ferroalloy workshop of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant recently successfully trial-produced low-carbon ferromanganese, an important raw material needed for refining low-carbon high-quality steel. From now on, China can use its own low-carbon ferromanganese to produce a large amount of low-carbon high-quality steel. This is a new major achievement in China's steelmaking industry.

Low-carbon high-quality steel is a difficult steel to refine. It is both strong and elastic, and does not shrink or expand when exposed to cold or heat. It is suitable for rolling seamless steel pipes, thin steel plates and other valuable steel products. In the past, the low-carbon ferromanganese used by steel mills to refine this kind of steel was all ordered from abroad, and could not be supplied in large quantities. Therefore, high-carbon ferromanganese had to be used instead, which affected the quality of the steel. After the successful trial production of low-carbon ferromanganese, the steel mill can supply a large amount of it to the seamless steel pipe factory, which will soon be put into production, to roll various steel pipes, and to the thin plate factory, which will be put into production next year, to roll various plates. In addition, using low-carbon ferromanganese to refine low-carbon high-quality steel can also shorten the smelting time and extend the life of open-hearth furnaces. According to preliminary calculations, using low-carbon ferromanganese to refine low-carbon high-quality steel can shorten the smelting time by fifteen minutes per furnace. In this way, the rows of open-hearth furnaces in the steel mill can produce more steel for the country every day.

    鞍钢炼钢厂试炼低炭锰铁成功
    据新华社讯：鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂铁合金车间四号电炉，最近试炼制炼低炭优质钢所需的重要原料——低炭锰铁成功。从此，我国可以用自己生产的低炭锰铁大量制炼低炭优质钢。这是我国炼钢事业上新的重大成就。
    低炭优质钢是很难炼的一种钢，它既坚韧而又有弹性，遇冷遇热不缩不涨，适合于轧制无缝钢管、薄钢板等贵重钢材。过去炼钢厂炼这种钢所用的低炭锰铁，都由国外订货，不能大量供应，因此不得不用高炭锰铁代替，影响了钢的质量。低炭锰铁试炼成功以后，炼钢厂就可以大量供给即将开工生产的无缝钢管厂轧制各种钢管，和明年开工生产的薄板厂轧制各种板材。另外，用低炭锰铁炼低炭优质钢，还能缩短熔炼时间和延长平炉炉体寿命。据初步计算，用低炭锰铁炼低炭优质钢，每炉钢能缩短十五分钟的熔炼时间，这样炼钢厂成排的平炉，每天就能为国家多炼出更多的钢。
