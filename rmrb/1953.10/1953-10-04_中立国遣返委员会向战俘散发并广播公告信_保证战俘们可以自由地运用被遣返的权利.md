    This is the neutral nations speaking to you.

    1.  The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is an independent organization. It is composed of India, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland. The Indian representative serves as the chairman of the commission. Our task is to guarantee all the rights you should have under the terms of the armistice agreement and other international agreements. We are here to ensure that you can freely exercise your right to be repatriated.

    2.  No one has the right to prevent you from going home, nor should anyone force you to go home.

    3.  Our task is to prevent anyone from using any form of pressure against you. If anyone uses pressure against you or attempts to use pressure against you, you must immediately report their name to the representative of the Indian Custodial Forces. The Indian representative will provide you with all protection.

    If you wish to complain or make a statement to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, you may submit such a request to the Indian Custodial Forces or any representative of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. If anyone forces you to do something against your will, do not be fooled. We will, in accordance with regulations, punish anyone who attempts to prevent you from going home or force you to return home.

    4.  If you behave properly in this prisoner-of-war camp, the Custodial Forces will treat you leniently. If you misbehave, engage in disruptive activities, or refuse to obey orders, you will be punished by the Custodial Forces.

    5.  During the ninety-day period starting from September (blank), representatives from your respective countries will come and explain in detail your rights and privileges to you. Furthermore, they will tell you everything about going home. They will especially tell you that you have the right to peace and that you have complete freedom to decide whether or not to go home. This explanation work is stipulated in the armistice agreement. You must all participate.

    6.  Do not be afraid. You are free to make your decisions. Those who wish to be repatriated will not be questioned and will be immediately repatriated home. Many of you have already been released from our custody immediately after expressing your willingness to go home and have now been repatriated.

    7.  After the ninety-day explanation period, you will still not be able to go to the place you choose. At the end of the ninety-day period, those of you who have not exercised your right to repatriation will remain in the prisoner-of-war camp under the supervision of the Indian Custodial Forces for another thirty days. During these thirty days, an international political conference will be held to study plans and decide your future. If the political conference cannot make any decision, then you will regain civilian status. You are free to go to a neutral country. If you wish to return to your homeland, you can still go.

    In this regard, you will receive assistance from the authorities of the place you choose to go to.

    8.  This is the personnel of the neutral nations speaking to you. We are completely independent. We are not influenced by any party. We are here to save you and protect you from coercion of any kind. Please trust us wholeheartedly. We assure you that we can give you all the above rights.

    中立国遣返委员会向战俘散发并广播公告信
    保证战俘们可以自由地运用被遣返的权利
    【新华社开城三日电】中立国遣返委员会在九月二十六日向在它看管下的全体战俘散发并广播了一封公告信。这封信的全文如下：
    这是中立国在向你们说话。
    一、中立国遣返委员会是一个独立的组织。它是由印度、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、瑞典和瑞士所组成的。印度代表担任委员会主席。我们的任务就是为你们保证停战协定条款和其他国际协定所规定的你们应有的一切权利。我们到这里来就是为了保证你们可以自由地运用你们被遣返的权利。
    二、任何人都无权阻止你们回家，也不容任何人强迫你们回家。
    三、我们的任务就是要防止任何人对你们使用任何形式的压力。如果有任何人对你们使用压力或是企图对你们使用压力，你们就必须立刻把他的名字报告给印度看管军队的代表。印度代表就会给予你们一切保护。
    如果你们想诉苦，或是想向中立国遣返委员会有所陈述，那么你可以将这种要求提给印度看管军队，或是中立国遣返委员会的任何一位代表。如果有任何人强迫你做违反你的意志的事情，你不要上当。我们将会按照规定，处罚那些企图阻止你回家或是强迫你回家的任何人。
    四、如果你在这个战俘营里行为规矩，看管军队一定会宽大地对待你。如果你行为不轨、进行扰乱活动或是拒绝服从命令，你就将受到看管军队的处罚。
    五、在从九月（空白）日开始的九十天期间，你们所属国家的代表将来详细地向你们解释你们的权利和特权。而且他们将告诉你们有关你们回家的一切事情。他们特别要告诉你们，你们有和平的权利，你们对于回家与否的决定有完全的自由。这种解释工作是停战协定上所规定的。你们必须全体去参加。
    六、不要害怕。你们可以自由地做出你们的决定。那些愿意被遣返的人们将不予询问，立刻予以遣返回家。你们当中有许多人在表示愿意回家以后，就立刻从我们的看管下释放出来，现在已经被遣返了。
    七、在为期九十天的解释之后，你们还不得前往你们所选择去的地方。在九十天期满时，你们这些人当中凡是还没有行使其遣返权利的人，还要在印度看管部队的监管下留在战俘营中再等三十天。在这三十天当中，将举行一个国际间的政治会议，研究计划，决定你们的前途。假如政治会议不能作出任何决定，那么，你们将恢复平民的身份。你们可以自由地到一个中立国去。如果你们愿意回到你们的祖国，你们还是可以去的。
    关于这一点，你们将得到你们所选择前往的地方的当局的帮助。
    八、这是中立国的人员在对你们讲话。我们是完全独立的。我们不受任何一方的影响。我们到这里来就是为了拯救你们，保护你们不受任何方式的胁迫。请你们全心信任我们。我们向你们保证：我们可以给予你们上述一切权利。
