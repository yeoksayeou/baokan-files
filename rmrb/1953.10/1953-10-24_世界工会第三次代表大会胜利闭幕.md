Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Third World Federation of Trade Unions Congress victoriously concluded on the evening of the 21st.

At the beginning of the evening session on the 21st, Renauld D'Haume gave a report on the work of the Proposals Examination Committee. He announced that the congress had received 3,445 congratulatory letters and telegrams from 56 countries, and the number and content of these letters and telegrams proved that the work of this congress had received a tremendous response among working people all over the world. He said that the committee had studied 32 proposals put forward by delegations from various countries, and the congress unanimously adopted resolutions on several of them. Other proposals will be forwarded to the executive bodies of the World Federation of Trade Unions for study and reference in future work. The congress unanimously adopted the report of the Proposals Examination Committee.

The chairman of the Election Committee, Henri Raynaud, reported the results of the election of the two bodies, the World Federation of Trade Unions Council and the Executive Committee. All the delegates stood up and greeted Vitorio, Louis Saillant, N.M. Shvernik, Liu Ningyi, Alain Le Léap, Dange, Lombardo Toledano, and other leaders of the international workers' movement who were elected as members of the Executive Committee with a storm of applause.

At the closing meeting, the President of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Vitorio, delivered a brief speech. He thanked the working people of Vienna for their assistance to the congress. He pointed out that the proceedings of the congress convincingly proved that representatives, whether they were members of the World Federation of Trade Unions or not, had reached a consensus in discussing all the issues. Our congress was conducted under the banner of unity. Our current task is to unite all trade unions in every enterprise, city, country, and the world. Our congress is an extremely important event in the history of the workers' movement, demonstrating that world workers' unity is increasing day by day, marking a new stage in the struggle.

Vitorio continued, "Our congress vividly demonstrates the strength of the international trade union movement. Currently, our task is not only to protect our living conditions, but we must also turn to the offensive and strive to improve living standards and increase wages. This means that we must wage a resolute struggle against the source of the deterioration of living conditions, against imperialist monopoly capitalists, against preparations for new wars, and against the expansion of armaments. Now, the most important task is to publicize the results of the congress as much as possible to the broad masses of working people in various countries of the world. We should explain that this congress has formulated new and effective methods of fighting for peace and democracy, for improving living conditions, and for freedom and independence."

Vitorio emphasized that the greatest assistance must be given to the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries who are fighting for freedom and democratic rights. He said that in this regard, our task is not only to establish united action among the working people of colonial and semi-colonial countries, but also to continuously consolidate the fraternal ties between the working classes of colonial and metropolitan countries.

The congress closed amidst cheers of "Unity!" "Peace!" "Independence!" "Long live the great World Federation of Trade Unions!" in various languages.

The congress unanimously adopted resolutions on Saillant's "Report on the Activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Tasks of Trade Unions in Strengthening the United Action of Working People in the Struggle to Improve Living Standards and for Peace" and Vitorio's "Report on the Tasks of Trade Unions in Capitalist and Colonial Countries in the Struggle for Economic and Social Development and in Defending National Independence and Democratic Freedom." The congress adopted in principle the report by Viajayasastra on "Developing the Trade Union Movement in Colonial and Semi-Colonial Countries." According to the suggestion of the Tunisian delegation, the congress instructed the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions to draft the final version of the resolution.

The congress adopted an open letter to all trade union organizations and trade union members who are not members of the World Federation of Trade Unions and a letter to the workers and trade unions of European countries.

The congress passed a resolution on the situation in Iran, expressing solidarity with the Iranian working people who are fighting for freedom and independence. The congress passed a resolution condemning the military agreement signed by the executioner of the American and Spanish people, Franco, and called on all working people to rise up in support of the working class and people of Spain. The congress also passed a telegram to express sympathy to those fighters who are suffering torture and persecution in prisons for the cause of the working people and national independence. The delegates attending the congress swore in the telegram: to redouble their efforts for the unity of the working class and international solidarity, to rescue them from prison, to free them from torture and humiliation, and to ensure that the freedom and rights of working people are respected throughout the world.

    世界工会第三次代表大会胜利闭幕
    据新华社讯：世界工会第三次代表大会二十一日晚间胜利闭幕。
    在二十一日晚间会议开始时，雷纳·杜阿梅作了关于提案审查委员会的工作报告。他宣布大会收到了来自五十六个国家的三千四百四十五封祝贺信电，从这些信电的数量和内容来看，证明这次大会的工作已在全世界劳动人民中获得巨大的反响。他说，委员会研究了各国代表团提出的三十二项提案，其中有几项提案由大会一致作出决议。其他提案将转交世界工会联合会的执行机构予以研究，在今后工作中参考。大会一致通过了提案审查委员会的报告。
    选举委员会主席亨利·雷诺报告了世界工联理事会和执行委员会两个机构的选举结果。全体代表起立以暴风雨般的鼓掌欢迎维多里奥、路易·赛扬、尼·米·什维尔尼克、刘宁一、阿兰·勒里普、丹吉、伦巴多·托列达诺以及其他国际工人运动领袖当选为执行委员会委员。
    在闭幕会议上，世界工联主席维多里奥发表了简短演说。他感谢维也纳劳动人民对大会的帮助。他指出，大会进行情况令人信服地证明：无论是加入世界工联或是没有加入世界工联组织的代表，在讨论所有的问题中都达成了一致的意见。我们的代表大会是在团结的标志下进行的。目前我们的任务是要使各个企业、城市、国家以及全世界的一切工会团结一致。我们的代表大会是工人运动历史上一件极其重大的事，它证明世界工人团结日见加强，标志着斗争的新阶段。
    维多里奥继续说，我们的代表大会，鲜明地表现出国际工会运动的力量。目前，我们的任务不仅是保护我们的生活条件，我们还要转向进攻，争取提高生活水平、增加工资。这就是说，我们要向生活条件恶化的根源，对帝国主义垄断资本家、对新战争的准备、对军备扩张展开坚决的斗争。现在，最重要的任务是尽可能多地向世界各国广大的劳动群众宣传代表大会的成果。我们应当说明，这一次代表大会拟定了为和平与民主、为改善生活条件、为自由与独立而斗争的新的有效的方法。
    维多里奥强调说，必须对为自由和民主权利而斗争的殖民地和半殖民地国家的人民给予最大的援助。他说，在这方面，我们的任务不仅是要使殖民地和半殖民地国家的劳动人民建立一致行动，而且要不断地巩固殖民地和宗主国工人阶级之间兄弟友谊联系。
    在各国语言的欢呼“团结！”“和平！”“独立！”“伟大的世界工会联合会万岁！”声中，大会闭幕。
    大会就赛扬的“关于世界工会联合会的活动和工会今后在争取提高生活水平与争取和平的斗争中加强劳动人民一致行动的任务的报告”和维多里奥的“资本主义与殖民地国家内的工会在争取经济与社会发展、在维护民族独立与民主自由方面的任务的报告”，一致通过了决议。大会在原则上通过了维佳佳萨斯特拉就“开展殖民地和半殖民地国家中的工会运动”的报告，依照突尼斯代表团的建议，大会责成世界工联书记处拟就该项决议的定稿。
    大会通过了给没有参加世界工联的所有工会组织和工会会员的公开信和告欧洲各国工人与工会书。
    大会通过一项关于伊朗局势的决议，向正在争取自由和独立的伊朗劳动人民表示声援。大会通过一项决议，谴责美国和西班牙人民的刽子手佛朗哥所签订的军事协定，号召全体劳动人民起来声援西班牙的工人阶级和人民。大会并通过一个电文，慰问那些在监狱内受折磨和遭受迫害的为劳动人民事业和民族独立而奋斗的战士。出席大会代表在电文中宣誓：要加倍努力，为工人阶级的团结和国际团结，为营救他们出狱，为使他们摆脱折磨和侮辱，为保证劳动人民的自由和权利在全世界受到尊重而斗争。
