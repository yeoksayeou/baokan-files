    Wuhan Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station Organizes Processing Plants to Improve Product Quality

    In order to continue organizing sources of goods, improve the quality of processed products, and do a good job in supplying the market during the peak season, the Wuhan Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station has successively signed processing order and exclusive sales contracts with eighteen industries in Wuhan, including knitting, towels, enamel, matches, leather goods, batteries, stationery, and sporting goods. At present, workers in various processing plants are stepping up production, and some products have been successively supplied to the market.

    This time, the quantity and variety of processing orders and exclusive sales by the station have greatly increased. The total value of goods purchased in the second half of the year increased by 252.23 percent compared with the first half of the year, and the fourth quarter also increased by 81.27 percent compared with the third quarter; the variety of colors and patterns has also expanded by more than 300 kinds, which are welcomed by the majority of farmers. Products that the station did not operate in the past, such as combs, scissors, mirrors, candles, as well as copperware and copper locks, are now also being purchased. After accepting the processing order tasks, the workers in various factories have shown great enthusiasm for production. Workers at the Yizhong Electrical Machinery Towel Factory and the Hongxing and Baofeng Enamel Factories have implemented a two-shift system to actively increase production.

    The station has organized inspection personnel and dispatched resident factory staff to go deep into the workshops of various processing plants to inspect finished products, semi-finished products, and ingredients, and to jointly study with the workers to improve the quality and style of the products. For example, towels used to have only a dozen patterns and were woven with only 20-count or 16-count yarn. The masses reported that they were not durable and not beautiful. Now, after research, 20-count, 32-count, and 42-count yarns are used in combination for weaving, and the method of ironing with a flattening machine is adopted, so that many bright and beautiful towels can be woven. Another example is carbon paper, which has pinholes, is easy to fade, and is not durable. Now, when waxing, the work of matching raw materials and dragging the wax evenly is done well. This not only overcomes the past problem of pinholes on the paper surface, but also can adapt to changes in the weather, not solidifying when it is cold and not dissolving when it is hot. The quality and specifications of many other new products, such as Dagong fountain pens, mimeograph machines, enamel utensils, basketballs, volleyballs, and electric machine towels, are also being continuously improved on the original basis. Because the product specifications and quality are gradually improving, they are welcomed by consumers in the market. (An Jianmin, Li Hongliang)

    武汉百货采购供应站组织加工厂改进产品质量
    武汉百货采购供应站为继续组织货源，提高加工产品质量，作好旺季市场供应工作，先后与武汉市针织、毛巾、搪瓷、火柴、皮件、电池、文具、体育用品等十八个行业分别签订了加工订货包销合同。目前各加工厂的工人们正加紧生产，有些产品已陆续供应市场。
    这次该站加工订货包销的数量和品种都有很大增加。下半年进货总值比上半年增加了百分之二百五十二点二三，第四季度也较第三季度增加百分之八十一点二七；花色品种也扩大了三百多种，受到广大农民的欢迎。过去该站没有经营的产品，如梳篦、剪刀、镜子、蜡烛以及铜器、铜锁等，现在也进行了采购。各厂在接受了加工订货任务后，工人们都表现了很高的生产热情。一中电机毛巾厂和红星、宝丰两家搪瓷厂的工人们并实行了两班制，积极增加生产。
    该站组织了检验人员和派出驻厂员深入到各加工厂的车间，对成品、半成品和配料工作进行检验，并和工人们共同研究改进产品的质量和式样。如毛巾过去仅有十余种花样，只是用二十支或十六支纱织成的，群众反映不耐用、不美观。现研究改用二十支、三十二支、四十二支纱配合纺织，并采用压平机烫的办法，已能织出许多鲜艳美丽的毛巾。又如复写纸上有沙眼容易掉色，不耐用。现在在上蜡时就作好配合原料拖匀蜡质的工作，这样不仅克服了过去纸面上有沙眼的毛病，而且能适应天气变化，天冷时不凝结，天热也不溶化。其他许多新产品如大公金笔、油印机、搪瓷器皿、篮球、排球以及电机毛巾等的品质、规格，也正在原有基础上不断加以改进。因为产品规格、质量逐步提高，所以在市场上便受到了消费者的欢迎。　（安建民、李宏量）
