The state-owned Northeast No. 8 Cement Plant, rebuilt on the ruins after being severely damaged by the Japanese invaders, was put into production on September 27. This cement plant not only produces ordinary cement, but also produces special cement that prevents seawater erosion. This special cement can be used to build coastal defense works, factories along the coast, seawalls, ports, and docks. It is a much-needed building material for China's national defense and economic construction.

The No. 8 Cement Plant was originally an old cement plant that was severely damaged when the Japanese invaders surrendered in 1945. The restoration project started in April 1951 and was completed on September 10 this year, ten days ahead of schedule. By making every effort to repair damaged equipment and adding less new equipment, the entire restoration project only used one-quarter of the investment needed to build a new plant of the same scale, and saved 19 billion yuan from the original planned investment.

During the restoration project, in order to fully utilize equipment efficiency and improve workers' working conditions, automated electrical control equipment was added to the rotary kiln. Safety covers, safety railings, and leakage indicator lights were added to the periphery of other machinery and belts. Dust collection equipment and safety air cylinders were added to the packaging and pulverized coal workshops. In addition, the plant also newly built 48 staff dormitories and one hospital, school, bathhouse, club, cooperative, and barber shop each. The hospital has X-ray machines, sun lamps, and electrotherapy equipment.

In the restoration project of the plant, the construction workers displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creativity, and overcame many difficult technical problems. Gao Zhenbang, the director of the engineering team's machinery workshop, created a special lathe and planer, which solved the difficulty of processing large ring gears weighing up to 16 tons.

    国营东北第八水泥厂已完成恢复工程
    在遭受日寇严重破坏后的废墟上恢复起来的国营东北第八水泥厂，已在九月二十七日投入生产。这个水泥厂不仅出产一般水泥，而且出产防止海水浸蚀的特种水泥。这种特种水泥，可以用来修筑海防工事、沿着海边的工厂、海堤、港口和船坞，是我国国防建设和经济建设上很需用的建筑材料。
    第八水泥厂，原来是一九四五年日寇投降时遭受严重破坏的一个旧水泥厂。恢复工程自一九五一年四月开始到今年九月十日，提前十天完工。由于尽量修复破损设备，少添新设备，全部恢复工程只用了新建一个同样规模的厂所需要的四分之一投资，并使原计划投资节省了一百九十亿元。
    在恢复工程进行中，为充分发挥设备效率并改善工人劳动条件，回转窑上增添了自动化电气操纵设备。其他机械和皮带外围，增添了安全罩、安全栏杆和漏电表示灯。包装和煤粉车间增添了收尘设备和安全气筒。另外，这个厂还新建了职工宿舍四十八幢和医院、学校、浴室、俱乐部、合作社、理发所各一处。医院里有X光机、太阳灯和电疗设备。
    建筑工人们，在该厂的恢复工程中，发挥了高度的劳动热情和创造精神，克服了很多不易解决的技术困难。工程队机务车间主任高振邦，创造一种特殊车床和刨床，解决了在重达十六吨的大牙轮上加工的困难。　（新华社）
