　　New Achievements in Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
　　Successfully Trial-produced 300-light Gas Meter Using Domestic Raw Materials
　　Workers in the Metering Field of the Utilities Workshop of the Shenyang Gas Plant recently successfully trial-produced a 300-light gas meter using domestic raw materials in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. This new product is an indispensable measuring instrument for the industrial use of gas. Previously, gas plants in our country could not manufacture it at all, and tinplate relied on imported goods. Now, the workers of the gas plant use ordinary iron sheets coated with tin to replace tinplate, which not only reduces the cost of the product but also extends its service life. Because tinplate corrodes after being used for many years, the method of using iron sheets coated with tin can prevent corrosion and can be used for ten years longer than tinplate.

　　Breaking Old Rules and Utilizing Broken Seed Cotton
　　The raw cotton used by textile factories accounts for about 70% of the cost, so saving raw cotton is a major task. The workers of the spinning workshop of the State-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory put their minds to saving raw cotton in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. Some workers focused on the white cotton, some on the chopped cotton, and some on the oily cotton, but no one considered utilizing broken seed cotton. Because according to the old rules since the factory opened, the upper-grade broken seeds could only be spun into 10-count yarn, and the lower-grade broken seeds could only be used as fuel for tea stoves. However, now, Li Dewu, a young worker in the willow-picking machine section of the cleaning workshop, broke the old rules and found a way to save raw cotton from the broken seeds: after three refinements, the upper-grade broken seeds can extract 128 catties of white cotton per day, which can be spun into 21-count yarn; after three refinements, the lower-grade broken seeds can extract 70 catties of upper-grade broken seeds per day, which can be spun into 10-count yarn. The utilization of these two types of broken seed cotton alone can save the entire workshop raw cotton worth more than 320 million yuan per year.
　　Improving Tools and Saving Wood
　　The Xie Wanfu team and the Wang Guotai team of the No. 1 Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration are enthusiastically engaged in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. The Xie Wanfu carpentry team completed 6,604 door and window sashes in just 21 and a half working days in the cutting process, completing the September production task eight and a half days ahead of schedule. These two teams used wood "ends" and reduced the loss rate, saving the country 82.26 cubic meters of wood, worth more than 113 million yuan.
　　At the same time, they also constantly improved their tools. For example, in the past, material trucks were moved by manpower, and each person could only move 13 pieces of wood. With the improved feeding truck, 300 to 400 pieces of wood can be moved each time. The grooving machine, three-sided planer, drilling machine, universal machine, etc., have all been improved successively, which can increase efficiency by 10%.
　　Created a New Record for Loading and Transporting Grain Straw
　　In the past, the Datong Station of the Datong Railway Transportation Sub-bureau could only load about six tons of grain straw per car, and the loading time took two hours and twenty minutes. The station's technology research team and loading and unloading workers worked together to improve the working methods. First, they changed from manually bundling the straw to machine-bundling the straw, and further unified the specifications and dimensions of each straw bundle, so that when loading, whether it is placed vertically or horizontally, a certain amount can be loaded and meet the standards. Then, they improved the loading technology and rationally organized the labor force, and finally created a new record for loading grain straw. Now, the same car can load 18 tons and 848 kilograms of grain straw, and the loading time is also shortened by 30 minutes compared with the past.
　　(Ma Liang, Mu Weifan)
　　Solved the Oil Leakage Problem That Had Not Been Solved for More Than a Year
　　The problem of oil leakage from transformers in the transformer workshop of the Kunming Electric Motor Factory, which affected the quality, had not been solved for more than a year. In this campaign to increase production and practice economy, the workers found the root cause: in the assembly of transformers, some workers assembled them without oil leakage, while others leaked after assembly. There was no unified operating procedure, and advanced experience was not promoted. Young worker Yang Neng检讨检讨at the discussion: "The transformers I assembled did not leak oil, but I did not talk about my method. I have conservative ideas." After inspection, the group exchanged operating experience and formulated a unified operating procedure to solve the oil leakage problem. (Ou Ronggui)
　　Unity and Mutual Assistance Between Shifts, Production Improved
　　In the past, the workers of the three shifts in the grinding workshop of the Tangshan Private Qixin Cement Factory were not united, and only cared about the production of their own shift. When handing over shifts, they often left many difficulties for the next shift, which affected the output and quality of the next shift. Therefore, the workers of the next shift, fearing that the previous shift would leave difficulties, would go to work one or two hours early to "supervise" the handover of the previous shift. Since the start of the campaign to increase production and practice economy in September, the workers in the workshop have reviewed their work and expressed that they will give full play to the spirit of collectivism and do a good job in production in the future. All the groups in the workshop included "guaranteeing not to leave a full mill or unnecessary work for the next shift" as one of the main contents when signing competition contracts. The three shifts also established a "comprehensive situation record book" and handed it over to the workers of the next shift, so that they could correctly and timely grasp the characteristics of the mill. As a result, the production situation has improved. Many workers have also been able to complete the quality plan. On September 17, the daily output of cement created the highest record in the factory's history, which was 3% higher than the new record that appeared in the safe production movement in August.
　　Rationalization Proposals for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
　　The workers of the machinery workshop of the wood processing factory of the Benxi Industrial Engineering Company's No. 1 Engineering Department produced and saved the country more than 74 million yuan in value in 20 days after launching the campaign to increase production and practice economy in early September. For example, young worker Zhou Sengjun and young League member Li Lianyun made suggestions on the rational use of labor and the utilization of waste materials for saving, which played a great role. Thanks to the efforts of the workers, from September 9, the output of a electric planer was increased from 6 pieces of floor per two minutes to 9 pieces, and 10,800 pieces were produced in 12 days, and 12 man-hours were saved. Moreover, not a single defective product was produced. For example, Han Deguo and Wang Wensheng, without affecting production, repaired and used the dovetailing machine with the wrong base (which was never taken care of in the past), saving 60 carpenters.

　　Offset Knife Replaces Pointed Knife, Good Product, High Efficiency
　　Li Yuxiang, an old worker from Heilongjiang 626 Factory, used three knives to machine a certain product. After studying, he changed one of the pointed knives to an offset knife, replaced the pointed knife, and also saved a root-clearing knife, so that the past three tool rest rotations were changed to two. The product is smoother than before. Six spring steel knives can be saved every month, and the efficiency is increased by 28.5% (because the time for one tool rest rotation and feeding is saved). The four workers in the same process immediately learned to do this, and it all worked. In terms of product quality, it has begun to improve. The repair rate of the second and fourth workshops has been reduced by about half, and the scrap rate of the third workshop has been reduced from 6.9% in the past to 4.8%. (Zhang Yuwen)
　　Yangquan No. 4 Coal Mine Found Many Tricks
　　Since the launch of the campaign to increase production and practice economy in the Yangquan No. 4 Coal Mine of the Shanxi State-owned Yangquan Mining Bureau, the workers have found 40 tricks of all sizes in just half a month, saving the country a lot of wealth. The electromechanical technicians, under the principle of ensuring quality, used old materials to replace new materials, which can save the country more than 300 million yuan. By repairing and connecting the used steel wire ropes, a new steel wire rope with a length of 3,000 meters was saved, saving more than 80 million yuan. The tippler workers used picks to dig out the coal left in the empty car during the work gap, which can dig out two tons of coal per day. The coal dug out in four months, excluding the overhaul days, is worth more than 20 million yuan. (Shi Yuming, Zhao Renjie)

    增产节约的新成就
    用国产原料试制三百灯瓦斯表成功
    沈阳市瓦斯厂工务车间计器场职工，最近在增产节约竞赛中，采用国产原料试制三百灯瓦斯表成功。这种新产品在工业上是使用瓦斯不可缺少的计量器，以前我国的瓦斯厂根本不能制造，马口铁靠外国进口货。现在瓦斯厂的职工们用普通铁板挂锡皮代替马口铁，不仅降低了产品的成本，并延长了使用寿命，因为马口铁年数用久会腐蚀，改用铁板挂锡皮的办法能防腐，比马口铁可多用十年。

    打破老规矩，利用破籽棉
    纺织工厂所用的原棉，要占成本百分之七十左右，所以节省原棉是一件大事。国营西北第一棉纺织厂纺纱工场的工人，在增产节约竞赛中，就动脑筋节约原棉。有的工人在白花上打主意，有的工人在抄斩花上打主意，有的工人在油花上打主意，但却没有人考虑利用破籽棉的问题。因为按这厂开厂以来的老规矩：提出来的上破籽只能纺十支纱用，下破籽只能当燃料烧茶炉。但是现在，清花间打威罗机的青年工人李德武打破老规矩，从破籽中找到了节约原棉的窍门：上破籽经过三次提炼，每天能提出一百二十八斤白花，可纺二十一支纱；下破籽经三次提炼，每天能提出上破籽七十斤，可纺十支纱。光这两项破籽棉的利用，每年全车间可节省原棉价值三亿二千多万元。
    改进工具，节省木材
    有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司谢万福小组和王国太小组正热烈地进行增产节约竞赛。谢万福木工小组的裁口工序，仅以二十一天半的工作日，就完成了六千六百零四个门窗扇，提前八天半完成了九月份的生产任务。这两个小组利用木头“头子”、降低耗损率，先后给国家节省了八十二点二六立方公尺的木材，价值一亿一千三百多万元。
    同时，他们还不断地改进了工具，如过去的运料车用人力搬，每人只能搬十三根木料，用改进后的送料车，每次可搬木材三、四百根。又如裁口机、三面刨子、打眼机、万能机等，先后都作了改进，可提高效率百分之十。
    创造了装运谷草的新纪录
    大同铁路运输分局大同站过去装运谷草，一个车皮只能装六吨左右，装车时间要二小时二十分钟，该站技量研究小组和装卸工人就一起动脑筋，改进工作方法，他们首先把由人力捆草，改为由机器捆草，并进一步统一了每个草捆的规格、尺寸，以便在装车时，不论竖放横放，都可以装载一定的数量并合乎标准。然后，又改进了装车技术，合理组织了劳动力，终于创造了谷草装车新纪录。现在同样一个车皮可装谷草十八吨八百四十八公斤，装车时间也比过去缩短了三十分钟。

    解决了一年多没有解决的漏油问题
    昆明电机厂变压器车间的变压器漏油影响品质的问题，已经拖了一年多没有解决了。工人们在这次开展增产节约竞赛中，找到了根本原因：在装配变压器工作上，有的工人装配好了不漏油，有的装配好后却要漏油，操作时“你一套，我一套”，操作规程不统一，先进经验没有推广，青年工人杨能在讨论会上检讨说：“我装的变压器不漏油，我没有把我的方法谈出来，我有保守思想。”经过检查，小组里互相交流了操作经验，订出了一套统一的操作规程来，解决了漏油问题。（欧荣贵）
    上下班团结互助，生产情况好转
    唐山私营启新洋灰工厂磨灰车间过去三个班的工人互不团结，只顾本班生产，在交班时，常常给下一班留下很多困难，影响了下一班的产量和质量。所以，下一班的工人因为怕上一班的工人留下困难，有的就提前一小时或两小时上班，“监视”着上一班的工人交班。自从九月份增产节约竞赛开展以后，车间工人都检讨了自己的工作，表示今后要发挥集体主义精神，搞好生产。全车间各个小组在订竞赛合同时，都把“保证不给下一班留满磨和不留不应留的活计”作为主要内容之一。三班还建立了“全面情况记录簿”，交给下一班的工人，使他们能正确、及时地掌握磨的性格。这样一来，生产情况有了好转。很多工人也能完成质量计划了，九月十七日，洋灰日产量创造该厂历来最高纪录，比八月份安全生产运动中出现的新纪录还高了百分之三。
    增产节约的合理化建议
    本溪工业工程公司第一工程处木制加工厂机械厂房的工人，九月初开展增产节约竞赛以后，二十天就给国家增产节约价值七千四百多万元。如青年工人周僧俊和青年团员李连运，提出合理使用劳动力和利用废物节约的建议，起了很大作用。在工人的努力下，从九月九日起，一台电刨子由每两分钟刮地板六块提高到九块，十二天中就增产一万零八百块，还节省了十二个人工。而且一块废品也没出。又如韩德国、王文生两人，在不影响生产的情况下，把安错底坐的倒卯机重新修理（过去根本不管）使用，节省了六十个木工。

    偏刃刀代替尖刀，产品好，效率高
    黑龙江六二六厂老工人李玉祥车某产品，原用三把刀，他研究后把其中的一把尖刀改为一个偏刃刀，代替了尖刀，还省去了一把清根刀，使过去转三次刀架改为转两次，产品比过去光滑，每月可节省弹簧钢刀六把，提高效率百分之二十八点五（因节省一次转刀架和走刀的时间）。同工序的四个工人马上学他这样做法，都起了作用。在产品质量方面，已开始好转，二车间、四车间的修品率已降低了一半左右，三车间的废品率由过去百分之六点九降至百分之四点八。（张郁文）
    阳泉第四煤矿找到很多窍门
    山西国营阳泉矿务局第四煤矿开展增产节约竞赛以来，在短短的半个月中，职工们找到的窍门大大小小就有四十项，给国家节约了大量财富。机电方面的技术人员在保证质量的原则下，利用旧料代替新料，可给国家节约三亿余元。利用废钢丝绳经过整修，接在一起，就节约了一条三千公尺长的新钢丝绳，仅这一项就节省了八千多万元。翻车工人在工作空隙时，将空车内翻不尽的煤底用钎挖出来，每日能挖两吨煤，四个月除检修日外，所挖的煤可值二千多万元。（史玉明、赵仁杰）
