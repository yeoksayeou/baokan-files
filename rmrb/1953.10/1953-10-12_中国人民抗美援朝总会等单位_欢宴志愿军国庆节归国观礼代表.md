After describing the great victory and its significance achieved by the people of China and Korea in the struggle against aggression and in defense of peace, Chairman Guo Moruo said: "The American imperialists are not reconciled to failure. They are doing their utmost to obstruct the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the rapid convening of the political conference, attempting to keep the international situation tense, and even worsen it. Therefore, our urgent task is to crush all the conspiracies of the American warmongers, strictly prevent the resurgence of aggressive war, strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, and pave the way for easing the overall international situation. The Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, recently formed by the people of the motherland to convey greetings to the CPV and the Korean military and civilians on behalf of the people of the whole country, is a demonstration of the determination of the people of the whole country to fight to the end for the cause of peace."

General Yang Dezhi said: "We have personally witnessed the high patriotic labor enthusiasm shown by the people of the motherland under the wise leadership of the Central People's Government and our great leader Chairman Mao, and the great achievements in production and construction obtained in the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan. We are extremely excited. Now the CPV has also launched a widespread savings campaign on the front lines, determined to save resources for the motherland as much as possible."

General Yang Dezhi said: "The CPV is determined to strictly abide by the armistice agreement together with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, and strictly guard our combat positions, further strengthen the combat effectiveness of our army, strictly prevent any sabotage and harassment by the enemy, fight to the end for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and actively support the restoration work of the Korean people."

The banquet proceeded in a warm atmosphere. After the banquet, the entire delegation of the CPV National Day Observance Delegation was invited to attend a Peking Opera performance.
