    Yi Farmers in Pozhou Township, Guanling County, Use Threshing Floors for the First Time to Thresh Rice

    Qiu Fanxiao of the People's Government of the First District of Guanling County, Guizhou Province, writes: During this year's autumn harvest season, the sound of threshing floors reverberates throughout the fields and dams of Pozhou Township, Guanling County, Guizhou Province. This is a new phenomenon that has never occurred locally before. The vast majority of Yi farmers in this township are using threshing floors to thresh rice for the first time in their lives. They are filled with joy and gratitude to the People's Government for helping them solve the difficulties of lacking agricultural tools and increasing the harvest of grain.

    Before liberation, the Yi farmers of Pozhou Township suffered from the cruel exploitation and oppression of the landlord class and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and agricultural tools were extremely scarce. There were only two threshing floors in the entire township for threshing rice. The vast majority of Yi farmers had no choice but to carry the rice home and beat it with wooden sticks when harvesting. In this way, one *dou* of rice often lost one or two *sheng* of grain.

    Two months before this year's autumn harvest, the district people's government specifically sent cadres to various villages in Pozhou Township to investigate the need for additional agricultural tools. Cadres from the People's Bank also went along to issue agricultural tool loans.

    At first, the Yi farmers were terrified when they heard the word "loan." They clearly remembered that before liberation, as long as they borrowed a little money from usurers, they would be ruined. They had never heard of anyone giving them loans to help them solve their production and livelihood difficulties. The cadres repeatedly explained to them that the purpose of the People's Government's agricultural tool loans was to support the development of production among fraternal ethnic groups; in order to give special care to the people of fraternal ethnic groups, the loan interest was very low and could be repaid in installments. After the Yi farmers understood the policy, they applied for loans one after another. The farmers in the three villages of Pobei, Jiantao, and ?? borrowed eleven threshing floors. After the Yi farmers obtained the threshing floors, their enthusiasm for the autumn harvest was extremely high. Mutual aid team leader Lu Qide smiled when he saw the threshing floor and said, "We never used this thing in the past, thanks to Chairman Mao!" The whole township harvested 352 *shi* and 4 *dou* of rice in one week; in the past, it would not have been possible to harvest so much in half a month. The loss of grain during the autumn harvest has also been greatly reduced. Lu Yingtian said: "My rice in the Naxian field yielded 3 *shi* and 5 *dou* per *mu*, which is 4 *dou* and 5 *sheng* more than in previous years. This is all thanks to the benefits of using the threshing floor."

### 关岭县坡舟乡彝族农民第一次使用挞斗掼谷子

    关岭县坡舟乡彝族农民第一次使用挞斗掼谷子
    贵州省关岭县第一区人民政府邱繁嚣来信：在今年秋收的季节里，贵州省关岭县一区坡舟乡满田满坝传来挞斗掼谷子的响声。这在当地是从未有过的新气象。这个乡绝大部分的彝族农民生平还是第一次用挞斗掼谷子。他们充满着喜悦的心情，感谢人民政府帮助他们解决了缺乏农具的困难，提高了粮食的收获量。
    解放前，坡舟乡的彝族农民受着地主阶级和国民党反动派残酷的剥削与压迫，农具非常缺乏。掼谷子用的挞斗，全乡只有两张。绝大部分彝族农民在收稻时，就只好挑回家去用木棍子捶打。这样，一斗稻往往要抖掉一、二升谷粒。
    今年秋收前两个月，区人民政府就专门派干部深入坡舟乡各个寨子调查需要增添农具的情况。人民银行的干部也随着同去，发放农具贷款。
    开始时，彝族农民们听到“贷款”两个字就骇怕了。他们还清楚地记得，在解放以前，只要他们借了高利贷者一点钱，就会被搞得倾家荡产。他们从来没有听说过有人会为了帮助他们解决生产和生活上的困难而贷款给他们。干部们反复地向他们说明：人民政府发放农具贷款的目的是为了扶持兄弟民族发展生产；为了格外照顾兄弟民族人民，贷款利息很轻，可以分期归还。彝族农民领会了政策后，纷纷申请贷款。坡背、检桃、??三个寨子的农民就贷了十一张挞斗。彝族农民贷得挞斗后，秋收情绪高极了。互助组长卢启德见了挞斗就笑眯眯地说：“过去我们哪用过这东西哟，不多亏了毛主席！”全乡一个星期内就收了谷子三百五十二石四斗；在以往半个月的时间也收不到这样多。秋收中的谷粒损失也大大减少了。卢应甜说：“我那纳线田的稻子，一亩收了三石五斗，比往年多四斗五升。这都是用了挞斗的好处。”
