    Why is the "Whistle" Newspaper Silently Avoiding the Urgent Tasks of Railway Employees?
    — A Review of the "Pravda" Article of August 13th
    The current task of all our central and local newspapers is to deeply and comprehensively publicize the resolutions of the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet, and to mobilize the strength of the working people to struggle for the implementation of the urgent tasks put forward by the Party and the government to industry, transportation, and agriculture, and for measures to further improve the material welfare of the people. This requires the editorial departments of newspapers to deeply understand these new tasks, creatively promote their real realization, to be proactive and pioneering in this endeavor, to be good at discovering the main problems in a certain sector of economic construction and connecting them with the tasks of the whole people, and at the same time to point out concrete and effective examples.
    As facts prove, not all of our newspapers truly undertake the task of publicizing and implementing the tasks put forward by the session of the Supreme Soviet. Some, even central daily newspapers, are extremely slow, show a lack of effectiveness, and replace the raising of urgent issues with general discussions "about important tasks." Some newspapers always go around in circles on well-known principles, unwilling to deeply analyze the new things that are resolutely put forward in the current course of life, unwilling to declare war on conservatives, and unwilling to resolutely come out against all the shortcomings that hinder our smooth completion of new tasks. In particular, the "Whistle" Newspaper, the organ of the Ministry of Railways and the Central Committee of the Railway Workers' Trade Union, often behaves in this way.
    After the session of the Supreme Soviet, the "Whistle" Newspaper published some editorials on the tasks put forward by the session, and also published many reactions from railway employees to the session's materials. However, these editorials and reactions were all general and did not focus attention on the urgent tasks facing railway employees.
    In a lengthy editorial published in the "Whistle" Newspaper on August 11, the editorial department talked in detail about the many tasks put forward by the session of the Supreme Soviet, but did not link these tasks with the tasks of railway employees at all. It only reprinted some materials on the increase in freight turnover, and declared that railway employees welcomed the decision of the session, thus "dedicating" it to the transportation industry with a stereotyped few lines. The editorial did not mention a word about the important role of the transportation industry in the nationwide struggle to rapidly improve light industry, the food industry, agriculture, and vigorously develop commodity circulation. The millions of readers of the "Whistle" Newspaper have the right to question the editorial department—why would such a general article, which in essence does not talk about the new tasks of the transportation industry at all, be published in the central newspaper of railway employees?
    The editorial concludes with the following sentence:
    "Transport workers are full of determination to gloriously complete the huge and important tasks placed before them..."
    We cannot help but ask the editorial department: Why is it that these "huge and important" tasks, which are in fact the immediate tasks of railway employees today, are not mentioned in the editorial?
    The newspaper does not mention a word about the new and higher demands made by the Party and the government on transport workers. In order to ensure the rapid rise in the production of consumer goods, the further growth of agricultural products, and the large-scale development of freight turnover, the task of railway and road transport workers is to fundamentally improve the service work for the needs of light industry, agriculture, and trade organizations, and to face these extremely important sectors of the national economy. In particular, the newspaper should point out that some transport workers underestimate the full importance of transporting goods for light industry, the food industry, and agriculture in a timely manner, and sometimes avoid transporting people's daily necessities—fruits, vegetables, fish, etc.
    Similarly, the editorial in the newspaper the next day, entitled "Continuously Reduce Transportation Costs," is also general and unspecific. This gives the impression that this editorial was written before the session of the Supreme Soviet, and the editorial department only "refurbished" it with a section on the national budget passed by the session; if this section is removed, it will be difficult for you to determine when this editorial was written.
    The editorial department of the "Whistle" Newspaper did not see the new tasks facing railway employees. Otherwise, how can the following fact be explained: On August 12, many articles, correspondence, and short commentaries on secondary issues can be found in the newspaper, but there is not a single article or short commentary mentioning how railway and road transport employees should face light industry, the food industry, and agriculture, and how they should help trade organizations transport goods faster in cities and villages.
    The manuscripts published in yesterday's "Whistle" Newspaper are mostly not effective, lively, and enthusiastic combat comments that reflect the current urgent tasks, but are official inferior articles! Instead of specifically analyzing the shortcomings in transport work, instead of bravely and principledly criticizing, instead of truly declaring war on conservatives and bureaucrats, the newspaper is perfunctory with the following general sentences:
    "The reserve forces for reducing transportation costs are huge, but there are still such (?) leaders in transportation who do not care about using these reserve forces, they only hope to complete the task of loading or transferring, but do not pay enough attention to saving state property. Such leaders (but why not list the names of two or three of them? - Editor), obviously, do not understand that caring about the improvement of economic indicators is also caring about the strengthening of operating discipline and the correct use of technology." How can such sentences not be empty and boring!
    The style of the "Whistle" Newspaper can be explained as follows: the editorial department of the newspaper obviously does not understand that publishing many generalized articles that silently treat the urgent tasks of railway employees not only makes the newspaper "slip empty," making it stay for a long time on a narrow small station, releasing "steam" of generalized rhetoric there, but also going backwards. It is now time for the "Whistle" Newspaper to get rid of the predicament of official inferior articles and return to the main line of the Party's combat news. It is necessary to make the entire army of railway employees and road transport workers hear the call of the "Whistle" Newspaper, so that the newspaper can intelligently explain the urgent problems in transport work, carry out criticism, promote the creative initiative of the masses, and concretely and combatively help railway employees solve the urgent tasks facing them in the nationwide struggle to strive for a new and great upsurge in the national economy and further improve the living welfare of the working people.
    The "Whistle" Newspaper's Reply
    The editorial committee of the "Whistle" Newspaper, with the participation of all editors, discussed the review published in the "Pravda" of August 13, "Why is the 'Whistle' Newspaper Silently Avoiding the Urgent Tasks of Railway Employees?", and admitted that this criticism was completely correct. As pointed out in the decision of the editorial committee, the editorial department of the "Whistle" Newspaper did not show the due effectiveness, specificity, initiative, and about expanding the propaganda of the decision of the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet.
    The work of the organizers of many groups (propaganda, finance and economics, transportation and loading work, road and construction, science, culture and art, etc.) of the editorial department of the "Whistle" Newspaper has been at a low level for a long time, lacking creative initiative, and not good at distinguishing major problems and explaining them quickly and completely. The above-mentioned groups did not carry out serious work for the writing activists. Articles are often written in the commanding tone of the competent authority.
    In order to quickly eliminate the major shortcomings pointed out in the newspaper's work, the editorial committee of the "Whistle" Newspaper has formulated a plan to explain the urgent tasks put forward by the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet, stipulating comprehensive reports on the struggle of railway employees to successfully realize the transfer of goods in light industry, the food industry, agriculture, and people's consumer goods. The editorial department will pay more attention to the issues of transfer costs and profits, the issue of improving labor productivity, and the issue of more fully meeting the cultural needs of transport workers.
    The editorial committee of the "Whistle" Newspaper ordered the heads of the editorial department's groups to improve the effectiveness and specificity in their work, and to improve the quality of manuscripts. A number of editorial staff members will be sent to the national railway lines to prepare manuscripts on urgent issues.
    In order to eliminate the shortcomings in the work of the "Whistle" Newspaper revealed in the "Pravda" review, the political department of the Soviet Ministry of Railways is discussing measures. (Translated by Huang Qunmo)

### 为什么“汽笛报”缄默地回避铁道员工的迫切任务  ——真理报八月十三日报刊述评

    为什么“汽笛报”缄默地回避铁道员工的迫切任务
    ——真理报八月十三日报刊述评
    我们所有的中央和地方报刊在现时的任务是深入而全面地宣传最高苏维埃第五次会议的决议，动员劳动人民的力量为实现党与政府在工业、运输业、农业面前所提出的迫切任务及进一步提高人民物质福利的措施而斗争。这就要求报纸的编辑部深刻理解这些新的任务，创造性地促其真正实现，在这一事业中要有主动性和倡导性，善于发现经济建设的某一部门中的主要问题并使之与全民任务相连结起来，同时要指出具体有效的范例。
    正如事实证明，并非我们所有的报纸都真正地担当起了这一宣传和实现苏联最高苏维埃会议所提出的任务。有些甚至是中央级日报的编辑部也极为迟缓，表现出缺乏效能，以一般的“关于重要任务”的议论来代替迫切问题的提出。有些报纸总是在大家知道的道理上兜圈子，不愿意深入分析那些在目前生活进程中所坚决提出的新东西，不决心向保守主义者宣战，不坚决出来反对那些阻碍我们顺利完成新任务的一切缺点。特别是交通部和铁道运输工人职工会中央委员会机关报——“汽笛报”就常是这样。
    “汽笛报”在最高苏维埃会议后发表了一些有关会议所提出的任务的社论，也刊登了许多铁道员工对于会议材料的反应。可是这些社论与反应都带有一般性，没有将注意力集中在那些摆在铁道员工们面前的迫切任务上。
    编辑部在“汽笛报”八月十一日所登载的长篇社论里，详细地说到最高苏维埃会议所提出的许多任务，但丝毫没有将这些任务与铁道员工的任务联系起来，只是转载了一些关于货物转运额增长的材料，宣称铁道员工欢迎会议决定，就这样以刻板式的几行来“献给”运输业。社论对运输业在迅速提高轻工业、食品工业、农业和大力发展商品流转的全民斗争中的重要作用却一字未提。“汽笛报”的千万读者有权质问编辑部——为什么这样一般性的文章，实质上丝毫未谈到运输业新任务的文章会登载在铁道员工的中央报纸上呢？
    社论是以如下字句结束的：
    “运输工作者满怀决心要光荣地完成摆在他们前面的巨大而重要的任务……”
    我们不禁要问编辑部：为什么在社论中竟没有提到这些“巨大而重要的”、实际上是今天铁道员工刻不容缓的任务呢？
    报纸对党和政府向运输工作者所提出的新的更高的要求一字未提。为了保证人民消费品生产的迅速上升，农产品的进一步增长和货物转运额的大量发展，铁道与公路运输工作者的任务是根本地改善对轻工业、农业和贸易组织的需要所进行的服务工作，面向国民经济中这些极关重要的部门。报纸中特别应当指出：有些运输工作者对于替轻工业、食品工业和农业及时运送货物的全部重要性估计不足，有时回避运送人民消费必需品——水果、蔬菜、鱼类等。
    同样，该报次日题为“不断降低运输成本”的社论也是一般化而不具体的。这就使人产生一种印象：好像这一社论是在最高苏维埃会议以前所写，而编辑部只是用有关会议所通过的国家预算一段把它“翻新”了一下；若将这一段除去，你将难于确定这一社论究竟是什么时候写的。
    “汽笛报”编辑部没有看见摆在铁道员工面前的新任务。否则，以下的事实将怎样解释呢：在八月十二日报上能找到许多有关次要问题的文章、通讯与短评，但对铁道与公路运输员工如何面向轻工业、食品工业和农业，以及他们怎样帮助贸易组织更快地在城市与乡村中运送货物，却没有一篇文章与短论提到。
    登载在昨天“汽笛报”上的稿件，其中绝大多数不是有效地、生动地和热情地反应当前迫切任务的战斗性评论，而是官样的劣文！报纸不是具体分析运输工作中的缺点，不是勇敢而具有原则性的批评，不是真正与保守主义者和官僚主义者宣战，而是以下列一般性句子搪塞其词：
    “降低运输成本的后备力量是巨大的，可是在运输上还有这样的（？）领导者，他们不关心运用这些后备力量，他们只希望完成装载或转运的任务，却没有充分注意节约国家资财。这样的领导者
    （可是为什么不列举出他们之中两三个人的姓名呢？——编者），显然，不理解关心经济指标的改善同时也就是关心操作纪律的加强及正确地利用技术。”像这样的句子又怎能不空洞和令人感到乏味！
    “汽笛报”的作风中所表现的可以这样来说明：该报编辑部显然不明白发表很多以缄默态度来对待铁道员工迫切任务的一般化文章，不仅使报纸“空滑转”，使它长久地停留在利益狭隘的小站上，在那儿放出一般化词藻的“蒸气”，并且还会向后倒退。“汽笛报”现在已该是摆脱官样的劣等文章的绝境，回到党的战斗新闻主要干线上的时候了。必须使铁道员工与公路运输工作者的全部大军都听到
    “汽笛报”的号召，使报纸熟谙事理地来阐明运输工作中的迫切问题，开展批评，发扬群众的创造主动性，具体而战斗式地帮助铁道员工解决摆在他们前面为争取国民经济新的巨大高涨及进一步改善劳动人民生活福利所作的全民斗争中的迫切任务。
    “汽笛报”的答复
    “汽笛报”编辑委员会在全体编辑同人参加下，讨论了刊载于八月十三日“真理报”上的“为什么‘汽笛报’缄默地回避铁道员工的迫切任务？”的述评，并承认这一批评是完全正确的。正如编辑委员会的决定中指出，“汽笛报”编辑部没有表现应有的效能、具体性、主动性及关于扩大宣传苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议的决定。
    “汽笛报”编辑部的许多组（宣传、财经、运输和装载工作、道路和建筑、科学、文化和艺术等）的组织者的工作，长期内都处于低下的水平，缺乏创造的主动性，不善于区别主要问题并迅速而完满地说明它们。上述各组没有对写稿的积极分子进行严肃的工作。文章往往是以主管机关的命令口气写成的。
    为了迅速铲除报纸工作中所指出的重大缺点，“汽笛报”编辑委员会拟定了计划以说明苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议所提出的迫切任务，规定全面报道铁道员工为顺利实现转运轻工业、食品工业、农业和人民消费品的货物的斗争。编辑部将更加注意转运成本和赢利问题，注意提高劳动生产率与更充分满足运输工作者的文化生活需要等问题。
    “汽笛报”编辑委员会责成编辑部各组负责人提高工作中的效能和具体性，提高稿件的质量。将向国家铁路干线上派出若干编辑部工作人员，准备迫切问题的稿件。
    为铲除“真理报”评论中所揭露的“汽笛报”工作中缺点的措施，苏联交通部政治处正在讨论中。（黄群模译）
