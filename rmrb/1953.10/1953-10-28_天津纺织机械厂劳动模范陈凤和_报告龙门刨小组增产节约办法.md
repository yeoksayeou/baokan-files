Reports on Cost-Saving and Production-Increasing Methods of the Gantry Planer Group

Comrade Editor: When the motherland called on us to launch a production increase and economy practice campaign, I was recuperating in Beidaihe. At that time, I couldn't wait to return to the factory immediately to participate in this glorious labor competition. On September 26th, I finally returned to my production post and participated in the work of formulating our group's production increase and economy plan. We will personally formulate the plan, and we will personally complete it. This is our greatest pleasure.

I am an ordinary technician in the gantry planer group. Under the cultivation of the Party and with the support of my fellow workers, last year, I took the lead in launching the "more watch the machine" (gantry planer) movement; and also first used and promoted the multi-tool, multi-edge working method, increasing production by more than double. As a result, I was twice named a model worker in the factory and honorably joined the Communist Party of China. This year, I further studied the advanced Soviet experience and improved the planer tools based on the Kolesov tool method; after three experiments (lasting about half a year), I finally succeeded in July this year, increasing the output of rough planing processing by 150 percent. After we promoted the Kolesov method in our group, the output has increased. However, our group's production tasks are very heavy this year. Although my 18-foot gantry planer often works in two shifts, day and night, it sometimes fails to complete the state plan. After inspection, we identified the main problem as the excessive time spent preparing tools.

After the launch of the production increase and economy practice movement, the factory administration asked our group to increase production by sixty roving frames in addition to completing the annual plan. After in-depth research, we are fully confident and certain that we can successfully complete this task in the fourth quarter.

Our specific methods are: 1. Complete the tool preparation for the next cycle before the end of each production cycle to avoid wasting production time. 2. Change the labor organization and vigorously improve the operating skills of existing apprentices so that they can operate the machines. This will enable all machines in the group to produce in two shifts, day and night, increasing output; and it will also cultivate talent for the motherland's construction work. 3. In October, further research the Kolesov-style rough planing tool, and convert it into a precision planing tool and a double tool, to process and manufacture roving frames, drawing frames, and doublers, and perform the precision planing process of the dragon bars. Preliminary experience has been gained in this work during the September experiment, and it should be no problem to complete it in October.

Based on the above, our group decided to increase production by ninety roving frames in the fourth quarter, which is thirty more than the administration asked of us. Now, all the workers in our group are taking active action. Soon we will report to you the good news of completing the plan.

    报告龙门刨小组增产节约办法
    编辑同志：祖国号召我们开展增产节约竞赛时，我正在北戴河休养。那时，我恨不得马上回厂，参加这一光荣的劳动竞赛。九月二十六日，我终于回到了生产岗位，参加制订我们小组增产节约计划的工作。我们亲自制订出的计划，我们又将亲手去完成它，这是我们最大的愉快。
    我是龙门刨小组一个普通技术工人。在党的培育下，在职工同志的支持下，去年，我带头展开了多看机车（龙门刨床）运动；又首先使用并推广了多刀多刃工作法，提高产量一倍多。因而，曾两度被评为厂内的劳动模范，并光荣地参加了中国共产党。今年，我进一步学习了苏联先进经验，根据科列索夫车刀法改进刨床刀具；经过三次试验（约有半年的时间），终于在今年七月间成功了，使粗刨加工提高产量百分之一百五十。我们组内推广了科列索夫工作法后，产量都提高了。但是，今年我们小组的生产任务非常繁重。上半年我的十八呎龙门刨床虽然经常分作昼夜两班不停地工作，但有时还完不成国家计划。经过检查，我们瞅准了主要毛病是准备工具占的时间太长。
    增产节约运动开展后，工厂行政方面要求我们小组除完成年度计划外，还要增产六十台粗纱机。经过深入研究，我们完全有信心、有把握在第四季度内胜利完成这个任务。
    我们的具体办法是：一、在每一生产周期终了以前，作好下一周期的工具准备，避免浪费生产时间。二、改变劳动组织，大力提高现有徒工的操作技术，使他们能够操纵机器。这样可以使小组内所有机器都能分昼夜两班生产，提高产量；而且也为祖国建设工作培养了人材。三、在十月份进一步研究科列索夫式粗刨刀，把它改为精刨刀和双刀，来加工制造粗纱机、并条机、合股机车面，和进行龙筋的精刨工序。这件工作在九月份试验时已获得初步经验，十月份完成是没有问题的。
    根据上面所说的情况，我们小组决定，在第四季度要增产九十台粗纱机，比行政方面对我们的要求多三十台。现在，我们全组工人正积极行动起来。不久我们将再向你们报告完成计划的好消息。
