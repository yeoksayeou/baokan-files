    The Shuangyashan Mining Bureau's Lumber Management Work is Extremely Chaotic
    He Chongyun of the Forestry Department of the Songjiang Provincial People's Government writes: Although the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau established a lumber section specifically for managing lumber last year, the lumber management work is still extremely chaotic. Due to the lack of precise and practical planning in supply work, pit prop consumption frequently exceeds the national quota. From January to August this year alone, pit prop consumption exceeded the quota by approximately 7,800 cubic meters, worth about 4 billion yuan. Old pit props in various storage yards were not sorted and stacked properly, and more than 600 cubic meters rotted due to prolonged storage, and now cannot even be used as firewood. The estimated loss is over 390 million yuan. Newly arrived pit props are also not stacked in time, and are scattered all over the lumberyard. Small, short pieces of less than one meter alone amount to more than 740 cubic meters, worth more than 480 million yuan. Management personnel have no clear idea of the lumber stored in the yards, so the supply work is of course not done well.
    In order to save state property and reduce coal production costs, the leading cadres of the bureau should immediately inspect the above-mentioned problems and properly handle them.

    双鸭山矿务局木材管理工作十分混乱
    松江省人民政府林业厅赫重运来信：双鸭山矿务局虽在去年就成立了专门管理木材的木材股，但木材管理工作还是十分混乱。由于供应工作缺乏精密切实的计划，坑木消耗经常超过国家规定的定额。仅今年一月到八月，坑木消耗超额约七千八百立方公尺，价值四十亿元左右。各贮木场旧有坑木未加整理归楞，有六百多立方公尺因积压过久而腐朽，眼下拿来当柴烧都不能起火。计损失三亿九千多万元。新来的坑木也不及时归楞，木场内东倒西歪到处都是。仅一公尺以下的小短材就有七百四十多立方公尺，价值四亿八千多万元。管理人员对场内所存木材心中无数，供应工作当然也就做不好。
    为了节约国家财产，降低产煤成本，该局领导干部应立即对上述问题进行检查并作妥善处理。
