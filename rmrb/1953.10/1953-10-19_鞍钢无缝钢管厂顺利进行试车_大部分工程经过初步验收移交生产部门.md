Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, October 18th: The trial run and acceptance work of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Seamless Steel Tube Plant project are proceeding smoothly. Most projects have already undergone preliminary acceptance and have been handed over to the production departments.

The acceptance work of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant is exceptionally meticulous and conscientious. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, more than one hundred technical personnel of various specialties have formed thirteen specialized acceptance groups covering civil engineering, metal structures, mechanical equipment, electrical equipment, electrical supply, water supply and drainage, gas supply, furnace construction, instrumentation and automatic instruments, industrial ventilation ducts, railway transportation, project cleanup, and cranes. The acceptance personnel, wearing red cloth armbands, carry inspection tools, design and construction drawings, and mechanical operation records every day, conducting inspections according to the specialized engineering systems. Personnel from the metal structure acceptance group sometimes wear safety belts to climb onto the twenty-meter-high roof frames to inspect the quality of the welding and the position of each steel frame. To date, with the exception of mechanical equipment engineering, metal structure projects such as factory building frames welded from thousands of tons of metal, foundation projects bearing thousands of tons of various equipment, underground pipeline projects, and other nine types of projects have been largely accepted in accordance with the technical design drawings and construction drawings made by the Soviet Union. Each acceptance group has signed the handover forms.

The exceptionally complex mechanical equipment operation and acceptance work is also being accelerated. All machinery must be accepted in three stages. The first stage is "technical completion" acceptance, based on the ability of a component or a machine to rotate normally in both forward and reverse directions for several hours, operated by the mechanical installation personnel of basic construction, with production personnel watching. The second stage involves running empty for a certain period of time according to the production procedure, with the work section as a unit. The third stage involves load running (i.e., productive running), with the work section as a unit. Currently, mechanical equipment in six of the plant's seven mechanical equipment areas (spans) has undergone "technical completion" acceptance, with two equipment areas having undergone empty running acceptance and one equipment area having undergone load running acceptance. The manager of the Mechanical Installation Engineering Company and the director of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant have signed sixty-one equipment "technical completion" and other handover forms. Projects that have not been signed are still undergoing acceptance smoothly, with acceptance forms being sent to the director's office for signature every day. In the "quality assessment" column of the signed equipment acceptance forms, 80 percent are marked with a score of five (i.e., excellent), and 20 percent are marked with a score of four (i.e., good).

Currently, only the heating furnace and the six major machine units of piercing, rolling, straightening, sizing, and reducing have not undergone "technical completion" acceptance. These are the largest, most complex, and most important production equipment in the entire plant. After repeatedly running and adjusting each ball bearing and each screw, they will be baked or lit (release of gas). During the more than one hundred hours of furnace baking, all production personnel throughout the plant will be at their posts, starting all the machinery and conducting empty running simultaneously. After all this meticulous and complex work is completed, hot trial rolling can begin, and after the final signatures of the heads of basic construction and production departments and Soviet experts, the moment when Anshan reports the completion of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant to the whole country will arrive.

In recent days, personnel from the four engineering companies and the Seamless Steel Tube Plant have been conducting intense and cautious operation and adjustments around the heating furnace and the six major machine units. Soviet experts are personally helping and guiding every day.

    鞍钢无缝钢管厂顺利进行试车
    大部分工程经过初步验收移交生产部门
    【新华社鞍山十八日电】鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂工程的试车和验收工作正在顺利进行。大部分工程已经初步验收移交给生产部门。
    无缝钢管厂的验收工作，是异常细密认真的。在苏联专家指导下，由一百多名各种技术人员组成了土建、金属结构、机械设备、电气设备、电气供应、上下水道、煤气供应、筑炉、计器及自动仪器、工业通风管道、铁路运输、工程清理、吊车共十三个专业验收小组。验收人员们臂上带着红布符号每天带着检验工具、设计和施工图纸以及机械运转记录等资料，分别按专业工程系统进行检验。金属结构验收小组的人员，有时身系着安全带攀登到二十多公尺高的房架上，检验焊接的质量和每一根钢架的位置。到目前为止，除机械设备工程而外，上千吨的金属焊接起的厂房架等金属结构工程，背负着数千吨各种设备的基础工程，蜿蜒在地下的管道工程，以及其它九种工程，大部已按照苏联所作的技术设计图、施工图等资料进行了验收。各验收小组已在交工单上签字。
    异常复杂的机械设备运转和验收工作，也在加紧进行，所有机械都要分三次验收。第一次是“技术竣工”验收，以一个部件一台机械能正常的正转和逆转数小时为准，由基本建设的机械安装人员操作，生产人员在一旁观看。第二次是以工段为单位，按生产程序空运转一定的时间。第三次以工段为单位负荷运转（即生产性的运转）。现在全厂七个机械设备区（跨度）已有六个机械设备区的机械作了“技术竣工”验收，其中两个设备区作了空运转验收，一个设备区作了负荷运转验收。机械安装工程公司经理和无缝钢管厂厂长已在六十一份设备“技术竣工”等交工单上签字。未经签字的工程仍在顺利进行验收，每天都有验收单送到厂长室签字。已签字的设备验收单中，“质量评定”一栏内，百分之八十写着五分（即优等）；百分之二十写着四分（即良好）。
    现在全厂只有加热炉和穿孔、轧管、整径、定径、减径等六大机组设备未作“技术竣工”验收。这是全厂最大、最复杂、最重要的生产设备。它将在反复的运转中考验或调整好每一颗滚珠每个螺丝钉之后，即烘炉或点炉（放瓦斯）。在那一百多小时烘炉期间，全厂生产人员将各就岗位，把所有的机械开动起来，同时进行空运转。这一切细密复杂的工作做完之后，就可开始热试轧，再经基本建设、生产部门的负责人和苏联专家最后签字，鞍山向全国报告无缝钢管厂竣工的时刻就到了。
    近日来，四个工程公司和无缝钢管厂的人员，正在加热炉和六大机组的周围，进行紧张而慎重的运转和修整。苏联专家们每天亲自帮助指导。
