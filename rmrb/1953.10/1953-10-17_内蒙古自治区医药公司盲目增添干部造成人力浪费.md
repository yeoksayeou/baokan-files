    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Pharmaceutical Company Blindly Increased Cadres, Causing Waste of Manpower

    Reader Sun Chengxue writes: I was transferred from the Northeast to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Trade Department on May 25th and assigned to work at the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Pharmaceutical Company. I stayed there for two months, doing nothing the whole time, and was later transferred to the West Mongolia Pharmaceutical Station. I have been at the Pharmaceutical Station for over a month now, and I still have nothing to do. There are more than 30 people at this Pharmaceutical Station, and their work is very leisurely. For example, the Secretariat Section, Business Section, and Finance Section each have a dispatcher. These dispatchers only need to send a few documents each day and then have nothing to do. When I was in the Northeast, we were very busy. Now, to have me sit idle here, I really don't understand the logic!

    The People's Daily editorial on September 6th concerning increasing production and practicing economy tells us that we must streamline administrative organs and save administrative expenses. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Trade Department blindly transferred cadres to the Pharmaceutical Company, causing a waste of manpower, which is not in line with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy. It is suggested that they quickly correct this situation.

    内蒙古自治区医药公司盲目增添干部造成人力浪费
    读者孙成学来信：我在五月二十五日由东北调到内蒙古自治区贸易部，分配到内蒙古自治区医药公司工作。在那里呆了两个月，一直闲着没有事做，后来就被调到西蒙医药站工作。现在我到医药站已有一个多月了，还是没有事做。这个医药站共有三十多个人，工作都很清闲。例如秘书股、业务股、财务股都各有一个收发员，这些收发员每天只要送几份文件，就没有什么事做。在东北时，我们工作很忙，现在让我到这里闲着，真不知道是什么道理！
    九月六日人民日报关于增产节约的社论告诉我们，要精简行政机构，节约行政经费。内蒙古自治区贸易部盲目给医药公司调配干部，造成人力浪费，这是不符合增产节约的精神的。建议他们迅速纠正这种情况。
