The Growth of Technical Strength

Training Technical Workers to Support Newly Built Factories

Many state-owned and local state-owned factories in Hunan Province are actively training a large number of technical workers for the newly built and expanded factories in Hunan. According to statistics from six factories including Yuxiang Cotton Mill and Changsha Machine Tool Factory, more than 2,000 new workers are currently being trained, including more than ten types of work such as spinning, weaving, maintenance, machine repair, lathe work, fitter work, sand casting, and assembly. Most of the 150 apprentices recruited by the Changsha Machine Tool Factory last year are now able to operate independently, and some have been promoted to third or fourth-grade technicians. Recently, the factory opened another training class, with another 150 apprentices currently undergoing training. More than 1,000 textile workers trained by the Yuxiang, Anjiang, and Xiangjiang textile mills for the local state-owned Xiangtan Cotton Mill, which will start operation in November, have mostly learned to use the Hao Jianxiu work method or the 1951 weaving work method, and each person can manage 200 to 400 spindles or four looms. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

Over the past year and a half, state-owned cotton textile factories in Qingdao have successively trained nearly 1,000 textile technical workers for newly built cotton textile factories in Beijing, Xi'an, Xinjiang, Hunan, Jiangxi and other places. Among them, 635 people have returned to participate in the production of newly built factories; those whose factory construction projects have not been completed are temporarily staying in Qingdao to continue learning. State-owned cotton textile factories in Qingdao provide great care for these workers from all over the country who come to learn technology. Therefore, these young people from all over the country who are eager to learn technology are making rapid progress. For example, the 96 workers from Xi'an who are studying weaving can generally watch 24 automatic looms after eight months of study, and some can watch 32.

Cultivating Junior Designers

The Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant added 13 new products in the production plan formulated in the first quarter of this year, and there is an urgent need to replenish product design personnel. To this end, the factory held an intensive product design class to train junior design technicians from among the technical workers. During the two months, a total of 204 hours were used to train ten technicians with grade six or above and six years of education, reaching the level of junior designers. They can generally design relatively complex part drawings based on sketches, measure and draw less complex castings and more familiar symmetrical part drawings based on physical objects, and can cooperate with technicians to carry out systematic drawing and drawing arrangement work for commonly used mechanical parts, adding new strength to new product design and trial production.

Opening "Sunday Technical Learning Classes"

In order to improve the technical level of workers and ensure the completion of production and construction tasks, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Anshan City Federation of Trade Unions has been running "Sunday Technical Learning Classes" in three phases since 1951, recruiting technical workers from various factories and mines for machining, fitting, riveting, welding, and drafting. As of April this year, more than 1,500 technical workers have been trained.

This year, the country's planned economic construction has begun, and training technical workers is an even more arduous task. Therefore, in June, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Anshan City Federation of Trade Unions expanded the "Sunday Technical Learning Classes" and divided them into 29 classes such as design and drafting, welding, electrical engineering, riveting, machining, and fitting. There are now more than 1,600 students, and 36 experienced engineering and technical personnel from various factories and mines have been invited to serve as instructors for each technical class. These teachers are very detailed and patient when teaching; they teach word by word and guarantee to the students that they will "teach the technology well."

The students' residences are very scattered, but they can overcome difficulties to study. Students such as Tong Suxian, Wang Yonghui, and Yang Yufang live more than ten miles away from the study location, but they have never been absent from class regardless of wind or rain.

Now all the students are studying hard, preparing to learn technology so as to better complete the tasks of production and construction.

Master Craftsmen Win "Meritorious Teacher" Certificates

In half a year, 148 apprentices in the Shanxi Machine Factory were promoted, 67 of whom were promoted to craftsmen, and 20 apprentices were promoted across levels because of their outstanding achievements. The factory implemented the method of signing "master-apprentice contracts," and many models of respecting teachers and loving apprentices emerged. Zhang Jinghua, an apprentice in the assembly workshop, not only learns from the master craftsmen modestly and actively in production, but also thinks about running to the master craftsmen's home to learn on Sundays. Hao Wenping, an apprentice, became a second-level craftsman in less than seven months because he learned well from the master craftsman, becoming the master craftsman's capable assistant. Master craftsman Liu Haishan spent his own money to buy pencils and notebooks for his apprentices to study hard. On August 3, the Shanxi Machine Factory held a factory-wide staff meeting to reward master craftsmen who had achieved success in training apprentices. At the meeting, a total of 50 master craftsmen received honorary certificates of "Meritorious Teacher" and bonuses of 6.88 million yuan.

Master Chen Changed

Chen Ming, from the brake room of the Datong Vehicle Depot, is an old brake fitter with more than 20 years of experience. He is relatively skilled, and some young workers and apprentices are willing to work with him to learn some technology. However, Master Chen is somewhat conservative and unwilling to teach technology to others.

Not long ago, the depot held a master-apprentice contract signing meeting. Master Chen felt uncomfortable seeing other masters sitting on the stage while he was standing below. Then, the depot exhibited the results of the labor competition. After seeing the cartoon "Breaking Conservative Thinking to Improve Production," Master Chen was greatly inspired. He thought, "How many technical talents does the great construction of the motherland need! Why did I keep my technology in my stomach in the past?" He criticized the erroneous idea of being afraid of losing out if others learned his technology at the group meeting that day.

After that, Old Chen began to take apprentices. Now, his two apprentices have been promoted to third-level brake fitters. He himself is even more energetic in his work, and he has transformed the hydraulic testing machine, improving work efficiency by 67 percent.

Growth of Reserve Forces

In order to meet the needs of the planned development of municipal transportation, the leaders of the Changchun Tram Factory have trained a large number of reserve forces. Since March of this year, they have trained more than 140 ticket sellers, more than 60 bus drivers (trainees), and 45 apprentices of various types. After a short period of study, these personnel have mastered professional knowledge and are familiar with technology. As of August this year, 19 apprentices have been promoted to eighth-level craftsmen; more than 100 ticket seller trainees and 39 bus driver trainees have officially started driving; and more than 10 cadres trained from among the workers have been assigned to basic construction and various workshops (sections). Currently, a part of the bus driver trainees and ticket seller trainees are still studying technology and professional knowledge intensively and will soon start working.

Promoting Administrative Management Cadres

From January to August this year, the East China Textile Administration Bureau system has successively trained and promoted 13 factory directors, 137 section chiefs, 95 workshop directors, 34 engineers, and a large number of administrative management personnel from among the employees. From January to September this year, the bureau has transferred more than 1,000 technical workers and production management cadres to work in newly built textile factories in Xi'an, Beijing, Xiangtan, and other places.

Training Six Technicians in One Year

Yang Bingchen, a milling machine worker at the state-owned Shanghai Turbine Factory, has trained six technical workers in the past year using the method of taking apprentices. Now two have been promoted to fourth-level technicians, three have been promoted to third-level technicians, and a new apprentice can also operate independently.

Chen Wenrong, a new apprentice, was transferred by the workshop director to work on the milling machine in less than a month of study. He blushed and said to Yang Bingchen, "Master Yang, I'm afraid it won't work to operate alone!" Yang Bingchen encouraged him and helped him solve the difficulties. Once, when Chen Wenrong was milling the electric hoist screws, the actual operation would take 40 minutes. He was afraid that he would not be able to break the quota, and he was flustered. Yang Bingchen helped him speed up the feed rate, and finally broke the quota. (Xuguang)

    技术力量的成长
    训练技术工人支援新建厂
    湖南省许多国营及地方国营工厂，正积极为湖南新建和扩建的工厂培养大批技术工人。据裕湘纱厂、长沙机床厂等六个厂的统计，正在培养的新工人达两千多人，其中包括纺纱、织布、保全、修机、车工、钳工、翻砂、装配等十多个工种。长沙机床厂去年招收的一百五十个学徒，现已大部分能单独操作，有的已升为三级或四级技工。最近，该厂又开办了一个训练班，另有一百五十个学徒正在受训。裕湘、安江及湘江等三个纺织厂为十一月就将开工的地方国营湘潭棉纺厂培养的一千多个纺织工人，大部分都学会了运用郝建秀工作法或一九五一织布工作法，每人能管理二百至四百个纱锭或四台布机。（据新华社）
    青岛市各国营棉纺织厂一年半来，先后替北京、西安和新疆、湖南、江西等地的新建棉纺织厂训练出了近一千个纺织技术工人。其中有六百三十五人已分别回去参加新建厂的生产；本厂建厂工程未完成的，则暂留青岛继续学习。青岛各国营棉纺织厂对这批来自祖国各地学习技术的工人，给予很大的照顾。因此，这些渴望着学好技术的各地青年们，进步都很快。如从西安来的学习织布的九十六个工人，学了八个月后，一般都能看二十四台自动布机，有的能看到三十二台。
    培养初级设计人员
    沈阳重型机器厂在今年第一季度制订的生产方案中，新增十三种新产品，迫切需要充实产品设计人员。为此该厂举办了一期产品设计速成班，从技术工人中培养初级设计技术员。在两个月期间，共用了二百零四个小时，培养了十名六级以上具有六年文化程度的技工，达到初级设计人员的水平。他们一般可以根据草图设制比较复杂的零件图，根据实物测绘不太复杂的铸件及较熟悉的对称性零件图，对常用机械零件，都能配合技术人员进行系统制图及图纸整理工作，给新产品设计与试制工作充实了新的力量。
    开办“星期日技术学习班”
    鞍山市总工会文教部，为了提高工人技术水平，保证生产建设任务的完成，从一九五一年起，开办了三期“星期日技术学习班”，招收各厂矿的车、钳、铆、电焊、制图等技术工人学习。至今年四月止，已培养一千五百多名技术工人。
    今年国家有计划的经济建设开始了，培养技术工人更是一件繁重的任务。于是鞍山市总工会文教部在六月间又将“星期日技术学习班”扩大，分为设计制图、焊工、电工、铆工、车工、钳工等二十九个班，现在共有学员一千六百余名，并邀请各厂矿的三十六名有丰富经验的工程技术人员，作为各技术班的教员。这些教员讲书时都很细致、耐心；一字一句地进行讲授，并向学员提出保证“教好技术”。
    学员住址很分散，但是他们都能克服困难来学习。佟素贤、王永惠、杨玉芳等学员，从家到学习的地点足有十多里地，但他们无论刮风下雨从未缺过课。
    现在全体学员正在紧张地进行学习，准备学好技术，以便更好地完成生产建设任务。
    老师傅荣获“教徒有功”奖状
    山西机器厂在半年中有一百四十八个徒工升了级，其中有六十七人升成了工匠，有二十个徒工因为成绩突出被越级提升。该厂实行订立“师徒合同”的办法，出现了许多尊师爱徒的模范。装配车间徒工张敬华，不但在生产中能够向老师傅虚心地和积极地学习，到了星期日他还想着跑到老师傅的家中去学。徒工郝文平因为向老师傅学习得好，不到七个月，就成了二级工匠，成为老师傅的得力助手。老师傅刘海山自己花钱买了铅笔和日记本给徒弟好好学习。八月三日，山西机器厂召开全厂职工大会，奖励培养徒弟有成绩的老师傅。会上，共有五十个老师傅得“教徒有功”的荣誉奖状和奖金六百八十八万元。
    陈师傅转变了
    大同车辆段制动室的陈铭，是有二十多年工龄的老制动钳工，技术比较熟练，一些青工和徒工都愿意跟他一块干活，好学些技术。可是，陈师傅有些保守，不愿意把技术教给别人。
    不久前，段里开了个师徒合同签订大会，陈师傅看到别的师傅坐在台上，自己站在下面心里怪不舒服。接着，段里展览了劳动竞赛成绩，陈师傅看到“打破保守思想，才能提高生产”的漫画后，得到很大启发。他想：“祖国伟大的建设，需要多少技术人材啊！自己过去为什么把技术蹩在肚里呢？”他就在当天小组会上检讨了怕让别人学会技术自己吃亏的错误思想。
    以后，老陈开始带徒弟。现在，他的两个徒弟已提升为三级制动钳工。他自己干活更有劲了，改造了水压试验器，提高工作效率百分之六十七。
    后备力量的生长
    长春电车厂领导方面为了满足有计划的发展市政交通事业的需要，已培养了大批后备力量。他们从今年三月起，培养了售票员一百四十多名，汽车司机（练习生）六十多名，各工种学徒工四十五名。这些人员经短期学习后，都掌握了业务知识，熟悉了技术。到今年八月止，由徒工升到八级工匠的有十九名；一百多名售票员练习生和三十九名汽车司机练习生已正式出车；在工人中培养的十多名干部，已分配到基本建设和各车间（科）工作。现在，还有一部分汽车司机练习生和售票员练习生，正在紧张地学习技术和业务知识，不久即将进行工作。
    提拔行政管理干部
    华东纺织管理局系统今年一月到八月，先后在职工中培养和提拔了十三个厂长、一百三十七个科长、九十五个车间主任、三十四个工程师和大批的行政管理人员。该局从今年一月到九月，已抽调出一千多个技术工人和生产管理干部，派到西安、北京、湘潭等新建的纺织厂去工作。
    一年带出六名技工
    国营上海汽轮机厂的铣床工人杨炳臣，一年来用带徒弟办法，培养了六名技术工人。现在已有两人升为四级技工，三人升为三级技工，还有一位新的艺徒，也能独立进行操作了。
    新艺徒陈文荣学习不到一个月，车间主任就调他到铣床上工作，他红着脸对杨炳臣说：“杨师傅，叫我单独操作，恐怕不行啊！”杨炳臣一面鼓励他，一面就帮他解决困难。有一次，陈文荣在铣电动葫芦螺丝啳，实际操作要四十分钟，他怕突不破定额，心里发慌，杨炳臣帮他加快走刀量，终于突破了定额。（旭光）
