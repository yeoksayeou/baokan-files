    Party Education Tasks in the New Academic Year
    —Soviet “Pravda” Editorial, September 27th
    The Marxist-Leninist education of Communist Party members and our cadres is a matter of special concern for the Communist Party. The Party’s starting point is that the task of correctly leading communist construction requires our cadres and all Communist Party members to be proficient in theory and good at using theory as a guide in solving economic and cultural construction problems. The continuous improvement of the ideological level of party members and alternate members is a decisive condition for enhancing their vanguard role in all fields of life.

    Currently, all Party organizations are preparing for the new academic year. On October 1st, all Party education institutions will begin classes. The summary of the last academic year proves that Party organizations are implementing the resolutions of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and are more actively studying how to improve the Marxist-Leninist knowledge of party members and alternate members. Within the Party education system, the study of the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has been widely carried out, and great work has been done in studying the documents of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. All this undoubtedly contributes to the improvement of the ideological level of Party members, making them more interested in political study.

    However, it would be wrong to be satisfied with this. The Party’s propaganda work still seriously lags behind the Party’s tasks in the field of ideological education of cadres, party members, and alternate members in the current stage of communist construction. In oral and written propaganda work, the bookish and dogmatic attitude towards studying theory, which is contrary to the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, has not been overcome, and the practice of quoting out of context has not been eliminated. When explaining theoretical principles, it is often divorced from the specific historical background, lacking a deep analysis of the transformative role of the Communist Party armed with Marxism-Leninism in social development, and disconnected from the Party's basic economic and political tasks. In propaganda work, issues such as the exchange of products are explained as today's practical tasks of the Party and Soviet organizations, while underestimating the great significance of Soviet trade and commodity circulation under the socialist system. The reason for this shortcoming is the inability to grasp the essence of Marxism. We also encounter such workers who pay lip service to combining political work with economic work, saying that politics cannot be separated from economics, but in practice, they separate political activities from daily economic construction work, and are not good at, and sometimes unwilling to, combine theory with the practice of communist construction. Many propagandists cannot well explain the tasks of Party organizations in further developing industry and agriculture, consolidating collective farms organizationally and economically, and increasing the public economy of collective farms. This kind of attitude towards studying theory is contrary to Marxism-Leninism as a creative science. It is necessary to eradicate the bookish and dogmatic attitude towards theoretical study from the practice of propaganda work, and must strive to make Communist Party members closely combine with the Party's basic political tasks, firmly grasp the essence of Marxism-Leninism, rather than playing with individual formulas and quotations. In the practice of propaganda work, Marxism-Leninism has been simplified and vulgarized on the issue of the role of the people, the Party, and the individual in history; the instructions made by the Central Committee of the Party in November 1938 in the decision on the publication of the "A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" were forgotten: the elaboration of the history of the Party cannot be centered on individual figures and their biographies, but must be based on the elaboration of the basic ideas of Marxism-Leninism, based on historical facts. Party propaganda often went astray into the superstition of personality cult. In the practice of propaganda work, an indifferent attitude was adopted towards studying such extremely important documents as the resolutions of the Party's various national congresses, representative conferences, and plenary sessions of the Central Committee. And these resolutions reflect the domestic and foreign policies formulated by the Party over the years.

    The task of Party propaganda is to eradicate from the practice of our propaganda work the phenomena that violate Marxism-Leninism when explaining the role of the individual in history, to clarify the decisive role of the people as creators of history, and to clarify the role of the Communist Party as the leading and guiding force of the Soviet people in building communism.

    The subjective and idealistic views on the nature of socialist economic laws still exist in written and oral propaganda, which in essence denies the objective laws of social development. On the other hand, in our written and oral propaganda, the Party's leading and transformative role, the socialist state which is the main weapon in the hands of the Soviet working people to achieve the victory of communism, and the source of strength for our country and the necessity of further strengthening the economic and defense forces of the Soviet Union, have not been properly clarified. There are also serious shortcomings in propagating Lenin and Stalin's national policies and their political, cultural, and economic results, and insufficient attention is paid to educating the working people in the spirit of Soviet patriotism and proletarian internationalism, and in the spirit of fraternal cooperation among the various nationalities of our country in the struggle to build communism and constantly strengthen the multinational Soviet state. Due struggle has not been waged against the remnants of nationalism, which runs counter to Leninism. We must resolutely oppose all kinds of distortions and vulgarizations of Marxism-Leninism, we must resolutely oppose the manifestations of bourgeois idealism, especially bourgeois nationalism, and we must constantly improve the revolutionary vigilance of Party cadres, all Party members, and the working people of the whole country. The Party's propaganda policy should be to educate Communist Party members and all working people to believe in the inevitable victory of the communist cause, to educate them to be infinitely loyal to the Communist Party and the socialist motherland, and to cultivate their spirit of friendship among all nationalities and the spirit of proletarian internationalism. It is necessary to highlight the superiority of the Soviet socialist system and the necessity of striving to strengthen the Soviet state with concrete examples. All this puts higher demands on Party organizations in leading Marxist-Leninist education, and entrusts Party organs with the responsibility of constantly and effectively paying attention to the substance and ideological content of Party propaganda, which is entirely understandable.

    The main task of Party organs in Party propaganda is to greatly improve the level of Party education, so as to make Communist Party members more enthusiastic about political study and research into the theoretical foundations of Marxism-Leninism. A great shortcoming in propaganda work is that Party organs do not pay enough attention to the study of leading cadres, so that some Party, Soviet, and economic workers do not systematically improve their Marxist-Leninist knowledge, and do not delve deeply enough into the economic knowledge of the national economy. They do not study in depth the resolutions of the Party's national congresses, representative conferences, and plenary sessions of the Central Committee, as well as the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, and often just look at the introductory pamphlets, so they do not get deep political knowledge.

    In order to eliminate the shortcomings in the study of leading cadres, it is necessary to properly organize the study of Marxist-Leninist classic works and the resolutions passed by the Party's national congresses, representative conferences, and plenary sessions of the Central Committee, which reflect our Party's domestic and foreign policies formulated over the years, in groups, classroom discussions, Marxist-Leninist night universities, and Party night schools. A major shortcoming in the work of organizing Party education is that many Party organizations have violated the principle of voluntariness, and have not estimated that a considerable number of Party members have completed their studies in the elementary schools and groups of political education in recent years, and it is no longer necessary to rigidly require them to study. At the same time, in many cases, Party organizations have incorporated Party members who have previously studied the basics of Marxism-Leninism in Party education institutions, colleges, vocational schools, and other schools into elementary groups. In order to absorb all Party members into the Party education network without distinction, many Party organizations often absorb some elderly Party members into schools and groups, without estimating that many of them cannot attend classes regularly and complete homework due to health reasons. Now Party organizations must abolish the practice of rigidly incorporating Party members into schools or groups. Party members should voluntarily participate in groups and classroom discussions, and study in Party night schools or Marxist-Leninist night universities. It is necessary for those Party members who do not have the minimum political knowledge to study in political schools. In order to further improve the level of the entire propaganda work and organizational work, it is urgently needed to widely unfold the propaganda in the form of reports, in order to meet the requirements of such Party members; they have completed the Party education schools and groups in recent years and hope to improve their theoretical knowledge by personally reading political books or classroom discussions.

    For this reason, lectures should be set up in Party municipal committees and Party district committees, and reports on the history and theory of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, industrial and agricultural economics, and the international situation should be systematically organized. Party organizations should focus attention on improving the level of reports, and link the content of the reports with the Party's basic tasks in domestic and foreign policies. In addition to widely unfolding propaganda in the form of reports, close attention should be paid to the form of political study in the form of classroom discussions, which has achieved good results in practice. Classroom discussion is an effective form of study for activists, which combines systematic independent study with strict inspection and creative discussion. Under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Union Republics, as well as under the Party border region committees, state committees, municipal committees, and district committees, classroom discussions of activists in Party, Soviet, trade union, youth league, and economic departments must be organized on a voluntary basis to study the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, dialectical materialism and historical materialism, political economy, and the economics of industrial enterprises and agriculture. Starting from the new academic year, the study year limit of Party night schools and Marxist-Leninist night universities is set to three years. This makes it possible for Communist Party members participating in this kind of political study to study Marxist-Leninist documents and Party resolutions step by step in depth. The level of Party education largely depends on the lineup of propaganda cadres. Hundreds of thousands of people who are willing to contribute their knowledge and experience to the cause of Marxist-Leninist education of Communist Party members participate in propaganda work. However, many Party committees do not regularly lead the work of selecting propaganda personnel who are theoretically cultivated, nor do they provide systematic assistance to propaganda cadres in improving their professional level. The task of Party organizations is to improve the lineup of propaganda personnel in political schools and groups in the future, and to absorb Party members with deep knowledge in Marxism-Leninism to teach classes. At the same time, it must be guaranteed to help propaganda workers in all aspects, to put the work of propaganda classroom discussion in the appropriate position, to select skilled people from the Party and Soviet workers who graduated from Party political schools, teachers of Marxist-Leninist basic knowledge in colleges, lecturers, and other propaganda workers with the necessary theoretical cultivation to lead this work. Party and Soviet workers, as well as experts in industry, agriculture, and other national economic departments, must regularly give lectures and reports to propaganda workers. Our newspapers play an important role in improving the entire propaganda work. However, it is intolerable that good propaganda articles are published less and less in our newspapers and magazines. Many Party committees lead their publishing institutions weakly, and do not use publishing institutions as the basis for improving all propaganda work. In this academic year, the Party's tasks in propaganda are significant and important. To improve the ideological and theoretical level and the level of propaganda work requires Party organs to constantly lead this cause, which is extremely important to our Party. It is necessary to constantly discuss the political study of Party members at various Party meetings, plenary sessions of Party committees, meetings of Party activists, and in grassroots organizations, and to create an atmosphere throughout the Party to oppose those who do not strive to improve their awareness and do not enrich their political knowledge. Party organizations should take all measures to ensure that the Party education schools, groups, and classroom discussions established on a voluntary basis work uninterruptedly, so that all Party members who wish to participate in this kind of study can regularly attend classes and complete study plans. It is necessary to systematically hold symposiums or classroom discussions for Communist Party members who study theory alone, and to assign them instructors. The political education of Communist Party members cannot be left to chance and unsupervised. Party propaganda is a lively and creative cause, which requires Party organizations to give play to initiative, perseverance, and brainpower. The responsibility and obligation of Party organizations is to eradicate the existing shortcomings in Party education, and to raise the entire propaganda work to the level of adapting to the great tasks of communist construction.

    新学年中党的教育的任务
    ——苏联“真理报”九月二十七日社论
    共产党员和我们干部的马克思列宁主义教育，是共产党特别关心的事情。党的出发点是：正确地领导共产主义建设这一任务，要求我们的干部和全体共产党员精通理论，善于在解决经济文化建设问题时以理论为指南。党员和候补党员思想水平的不断提高，是增强他们在生活各个领域中的先锋作用的决定性条件。
    目前，所有党的组织都在准备新的学年。十月一日，所有党的教育机构都将开始上课。上学年的总结证明：党组织执行着苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的决议，更加积极地研究如何提高党员和候补党员的马克思列宁主义方面的知识。在党的教育系统内，广泛地展开了苏联共产党历史的学习，在学习苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的文件方面进行了巨大的工作。所有这一切无疑地是有助于党员的思想水平的提高，使他们对政治学习发生更大的兴趣。
    然而，以此为满足就不对了。党的宣传工作仍然严重地落后于共产主义建设现阶段党在干部、党员和候补党员的思想教育领域中的任务。在口头和文字宣传工作中，仍然没有克服和马克思列宁主义的精神相违背的、书呆子式的和教条式的学习理论的态度，没有消除断章取义的作风。在讲述理论原理时，往往脱离具体的历史背景，对于以马克思列宁主义武装起来的共产党在社会发展中的改造作用缺乏深刻的分析，和党的基本的经济、政治任务脱了节。在宣传工作中，像产品交换制这样的问题被解释为党和苏维埃组织今天的实践任务，而低估了社会主义制度下的苏维埃贸易和商品流通的巨大意义。产生这个缺点的原因，是由于不善于掌握马克思主义的实质。我们还碰到这样的工作人员，他们口口声声说政治工作与经济工作相结合，说政治不能脱离经济，而在实践中，他们却把政治活动与日常的经济建设工作割裂开来，不善于，有时不愿意把理论与共产主义建设的实践结合起来。许多宣传员不能很好地阐明党组织在进一步发展工业和农业、从组织上和经济上巩固集体农庄、增加集体农庄的公有经济等方面的任务。类似这种学习理论的态度是与作为创造性的科学的马克思列宁主义相矛盾的。必须从宣传工作的实践中，根除对待理论学习的书呆子式的、教条主义的态度，必须设法使共产党员密切结合党的基本政治任务，牢固地掌握马克思列宁主义的实质，而不是玩弄个别的公式和引语。在宣传工作实际中，曾在人民群众、党、个人在历史中的作用的问题上，把马克思列宁主义简单化和庸俗化了；忘记了党中央委员会一九三八年十一月在关于出版联共（布）党史简明教程的决定中所作的指示：党史的阐述不能以个别人物及其传记为中心，而必须以马克思列宁主义基本思想的阐述为基础，以历史事实为依据。党的宣传往往走上了崇拜个人的迷途。在宣传工作的实际中，曾对学习像党各次代表大会、代表会议、中央委员会全体会议的决议这样一些极其重要的文件采取漠不关心的态度。而这些决议是反映党多年来制订的内外政策的。
    党的宣传的任务在于：从我们宣传工作的实际中根除在说明个人在历史中的作用时违背马克思列宁主义的现象，阐明历史的创造者人民的决定性的作用，阐明作为建设共产主义的苏维埃人民的领导和指导力量的共产党的作用。
    在文字和口头宣传中对社会主义经济法则的性质还存有主观和唯心的看法，本质上就是否认社会发展的客观规律性。另一方面，在我们的文字和口头宣传中对党的领导和改造作用，对于掌握在苏联劳动人民手中的取得共产主义胜利的主要武器社会主义国家，对于我们国家取得力量的泉源和苏联经济力量、国防力量进一步加强的必要性等，没有作应有的阐明。在宣传列宁、斯大林的民族政策及其政治上、文化上和经济上产生的结果方面还有严重的缺点，不够重视以苏维埃爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义精神，以我国各族人民在为建设共产主义和不断加强多民族苏维埃国家的斗争中的兄弟合作精神来教育劳动人民。没有对与列宁主义背道而驰的民族主义的余孽作应有的斗争。必须坚决反对对马克思列宁主义的各种各样歪曲和庸俗化，必须坚决反对资产阶级唯心主义、特别是资产阶级民族主义的表现，必须不断提高党的干部、所有党员、全国劳动人民的革命警惕性。党的宣传方针应该是教育共产党员和全体劳动人民相信共产主义事业的必然胜利，教育他们无限忠诚于共产党和社会主义祖国，培养他们的各族人民友爱的精神和无产阶级国际主义的精神。必须以具体的例子凸出地宣传苏维埃社会主义制度的优越性和努力加强苏维埃国家的必要性。这一切对党组织在领导马克思列宁主义的教育方面提出更高的要求，责成党机关要不断地和干练地注意党的宣传的实质和思想内容，这是完全可以理解的。
    党的机关在党的宣传方面的主要任务是：大大地提高党的教育的水平，以便使共产党员更加热心于政治学习和研究马克思列宁主义的理论基础。宣传工作中的巨大缺点，就是党的机关对领导干部的学习重视不够，因而部分的党、苏维埃和经济工作人员没有系统地提高自己的马克思列宁主义方面的知识，对国民经济的经济知识钻研得不够。他们没有深入地研究党历次代表大会、代表会议和中央委员会全体会议的决议以及马克思列宁主义的经典著作，而往往只是看看评介的小册子就算了事，因而得不到深刻的政治知识。
    为了消除领导干部学习中的缺点，必须在小组、课堂讨论、马克思列宁主义夜大学，党的夜校的党史学习中适当的组织学习马克思列宁主义经典著作和党代表大会、代表会议和中央委员会全体会议所通过的反映我党多年来制订的对内对外政策的决议。在组织党教育的工作中重大缺点是，许多党组织破坏了自愿的原则，而没有估计到相当一部分党员近几年来在政治教育的初级学校和小组学完后，现在已没有必要硬性地限定他们学习。同时党组织在许多场合下把那些以前在党教育机构、高等学校、职业学校和其他学校中已经学习过马克思列宁主义基础知识的党员编入初级小组。许多党组织为了把所有党员不加区分地都吸收到党教育网中来，往往把一些年老的党员都吸收到学校和小组中来，而没有估计到他们中间有许多人由于健康关系不能经常上课和完成课外作业。现在党组织必须取消硬性地把党员编入学校或小组的办法。党员参加小组和课堂讨论，在党夜校或马克思列宁主义夜大学中学习，应该是自愿的。那些没有具备最低限度政治知识的党员到政治学校中去学习，这是必要的。为了要进一步提高整个宣传工作的水平和组织工作，就迫切需要广泛地展开报告形式的宣传，以符合这样一些党员的要求；他们近几年来修完了党教育学校和小组并希望用个人阅读政治书籍或课堂讨论的办法来提高自己的理论知识。
    为此，必须在党市委员会和党区委员会设立讲座，有系统地组织有关苏共党史和理论、工业和农业经济学以及国际形势的报告。党组织应当集中注意来提高报告的水平，把报告的内容和党在对内对外政策方面的基本任务联系起来。除了广泛地展开报告形式的宣传以外，应当密切注意在实践中收效很好的课堂讨论形式的政治学习。课堂讨论是积极分子学习的有效形式，它把学员有系统的独立学习和严密的检查、创造性的讨论结合起来。在加盟共和国共产党中央委员会以及在党边疆区委员会、州委员会、市委员会和区委员会下面，必须在自愿的基础上组织起党、苏维埃、工会、青年团和经济部门中的积极分子的课堂讨论来学习苏共党史、辩证唯物论和历史唯物论、政治经济学以及工业企业和农业经济学。从新的学年开始，党夜校和马克思列宁主义夜大学学习年限定为三年。这就使得参加这种政治学习的共产党员可以按步就班地深入研究马克思列宁主义的文献以及党的决议。党教育的水平的高低，在颇大的程度上取决于宣传干部的阵容。几十万愿把自己的知识和经验贡献给共产党员的马克思列宁主义教育事业的人，参加宣传工作。但是，有许多党委员会没有经常领导选拔那些在理论上有修养的宣传人员的工作，也没有对宣传干部在提高业务水平方面进行有系统的帮助。党组织的任务是：今后改进政治学校和小组的宣传人员阵容，吸收在马克思列宁主义方面具有深湛知识的党员去上课。同时，必须保证在各方面帮助宣传工作者，把宣传课堂讨论的工作放到适当位置上，选派党政治学校毕业出来的党和苏维埃工作人员中的熟练的人、高等学校马克思列宁主义基础知识教员、讲师和具有必要的理论修养的其他宣传工作者来领导这项工作。必须经常由党和苏维埃工作者以及工业、农业和其他国民经济部门中的专家给宣传工作者作讲演和报告。在改善整个宣传工作中起着重要作用的是我们的报纸。而在我们的报纸和杂志上，却越来越少地刊载好的宣传文章，这是不可容忍的。许多党委员会对自己的出版机构领导得很薄弱，并没有利用出版机构作为改善一切宣传工作的基础。在这一学年，党组织在宣传方面的任务是重大的和重要的。要使思想理论水平和宣传工作水平提高，就要求党的机关经常地领导这个对我们党极其重要的事业。必须在党的各种会议上、党委员会全体会议上、在党活动分子的会议上和在基层组织中经常讨论党员的政治学习问题，在全党造成一种气氛反对那些不努力提高自己的觉悟、不充实自己政治知识的人。党组织应当采取一切措施，使得在自愿的基础上建立起来的党教育学校、小组和课堂讨论不间断地进行工作，使得所有希望参加这种学习的党员能够经常听课和完成学习计划。必须对单独学习理论的共产党员，有系统地举办座谈会或是课堂讨论，并给他们选派辅导员。共产党员的政治教育不能听任自流和无人监督。党的宣传是一种有生气具有创造性的事业，它要求党组织发挥主动精神、坚持不懈和多动脑筋。党组织的责任和义务是：铲除党教育中现有的缺点，把整个宣传工作提高到适应共产主义建设的伟大任务的水平。
