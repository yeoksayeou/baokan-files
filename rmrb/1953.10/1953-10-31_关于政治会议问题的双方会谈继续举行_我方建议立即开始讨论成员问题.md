(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 30) The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the Political Conference issue issued the following communique:

    On October 30th, the fifth meeting of the bilateral talks on the Political Conference issue was held.

    The US representative, Dean, spoke first. After having no reason to oppose our side's reasonable agenda of discussing membership issues first, he insisted on his unreasonable proposal to discuss the time and place of the Political Conference first, using the argument that easily resolved issues should be discussed first.

    Mr. Qi Shi-fu, the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from our side, immediately pointed out: The other party's statement had no new content, and the agenda proposed by the other party was absolutely unacceptable. How can the time and place of the Political Conference be resolved if the membership issue of the Political Conference is not resolved? Furthermore, the other party stated that they are only prepared to exchange views on the membership issue later, but not prepared to resolve this primary issue. May I ask, isn't talking without reaching a decision the same as not talking at all? If that is the case, where is the sincerity that the American representative is touting? Our side firmly maintains that the bilateral talks should first discuss and resolve the membership issue of the Political Conference, and then proceed to the discussion of the time and place of the Political Conference. Therefore, we suggest immediately adopting our agenda and entering into substantive discussions on the membership issue. If the other party is not prepared to do so, we suggest adjourning the meeting until October 31st so that the other party can seriously consider our proposal. The other party agreed to the adjournment.

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈继续举行
    我方建议立即开始讨论成员问题
    【新华社开城三十日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十月三十日，关于政治会议问题的双方会谈举行第五次会议。
    美方代表迪安首先发言，在其已无任何理由反对我方首先讨论成员问题的合理议程后，竟以先讨论容易解决的问题为最后坚持其先讨论政治会议的时间与地点的不合理主张。
    我方朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表奇石福先生当即指出：对方发言并无任何新的内容，对方所提议程是绝对不能接受的。政治会议的成员问题不解决，如何能解决政治会议的时间与地点问题？且对方表示只准备在以后对成员问题交换意见，而不准备解决这个首要问题，请问谈而不决岂非等于不谈？果如是，美国代表所鼓吹的诚意究竟何在？我方坚决主张双方会谈应首先讨论并解决政治会议的成员问题，然后再进入关于政治会议的时间与地点的讨论，因此建议立即通过我方议程，进入关于成员问题的实质的讨论。如对方还不准备这样做，则建议休会至十月三十一日，以便对方郑重考虑我方建议，对方同意休会。
