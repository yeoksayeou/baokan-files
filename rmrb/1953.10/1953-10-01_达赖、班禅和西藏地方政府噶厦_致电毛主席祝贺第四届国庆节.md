Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 30th: On the eve of National Day, the Dalai Lama of the Tibetan Local Government sent a telegram to Chairman Mao to pay his respects. To the great leader of the Central People's Government, Chairman Mao:

    On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, in addition to holding grand celebrations in Tibet, I would like to express my cordial and excited congratulations to you on behalf of all the monks and laypeople of Tibet. Since Tibet was peacefully liberated and returned to the big family of the motherland, for more than two years, under your correct leadership and the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, it has established a brotherly and close relationship with the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet. In the first year of the motherland's first five-year economic construction plan, all parts of the country, enterprises, factories, and mines have achieved great results in completing the basic construction work in the first half of the year. Due to traffic conditions, the Tibetan region has not yet been able to engage in extensive basic construction work, but with the strong assistance of the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, the Kangzang Highway, which is related to the development of Tibet's future construction, is being built and has achieved great results. As for the rumors created by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary government in the past, it is now fully confirmed that they were provocations and sabotage because the Buddhism believed by all the monks and laypeople in Tibet and the politics, economy, culture, and people's lives in the Tibetan region have been further developed. Under your correct leadership and the Central People's Government and with the help of the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, we have complete and firm confidence that we can build Tibet even better.
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all nationalities in China!
                    Dalai Lama of the Tibetan Local Government
                      September 30, 1953

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 30th: The Panchen Erdeni of Tibet sent a telegram to Chairman Mao to congratulate the National Day. The telegram is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:

    As National Day approaches, I am excited to think that in the past four years, the great motherland has become increasingly prosperous and strong under your wise and correct leadership, and the people of the motherland have also made significant contributions to the cause of defending world peace. In particular, in the two years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, construction in all aspects has also been developed. Thanks to the close help of the People's Liberation Army and staff entering Tibet, the people of the Xigaze area have achieved great success in various construction projects. Last year and this year, the farmers received interest-free grain and loans, and the People's Liberation Army personally guided the farmers to build water conservancy projects. Especially before the autumn harvest this year, when the rural areas were in a state of food shortage, the Central People's Government allocated relief funds and timely rescued many farmers who had no grain reserves, enabling them to overcome the disaster. The farmers all said: Chairman Mao's eyes are so bright! He has seen our suffering clearly. We must produce well to repay Chairman Mao. Since the People's Liberation Army entered the Xigaze area, they have reclaimed land and produced their own food. Their crops and vegetables are growing particularly well. The farmers have all proposed to learn from the People's Liberation Army. They are paying more attention to watering, weeding, and fertilizing than in previous years, and they have achieved a bumper harvest this year.
    Respected Chairman Mao: The primary schools in Xigaze are doing very well, and the students' academic performance is very satisfying to the parents. The Preparatory Committee of the Patriotic Youth Cultural Association of Xigaze was established just two months ago, and the number of members has increased to more than one hundred. This organization has made the young people more close and united. The responsible cadres of the People's Liberation Army also often give them lectures, enabling the young people to further understand the greatness of the motherland and learn a lot of new knowledge. Under the support of loans and orders from the People's Bank and state-owned trading companies, the commerce and handicraft industry in Xigaze have also begun to prosper unprecedentedly. Now, Xigaze is also building people's hospitals and residences. These things have made the Tibetan people deeply realize that only under your leadership and by closely uniting with all fraternal nationalities of the motherland can the Tibetan people obtain freedom and happiness. After the Tibetan tribute delegation returned to Tibet, I heard your various instructions on the construction of Tibet, which made me feel even more your deep concern for the Tibetan people and the warmth of the big family of the motherland. We will definitely follow your instructions, strengthen internal unity among nationalities, and work together with the People's Liberation Army to build Tibet even better and advance together with the people of all fraternal nationalities of the motherland!
Panchen Erdeni, September 24

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 30th: The Kashag of the Tibetan Local Government sent a telegram to Chairman Mao to congratulate the 1953 National Day on the eve of National Day. The telegram is as follows: To Chairman Mao, the leader of all nationalities in China:

    When our great motherland is holding grand celebrations for the fourth National Day, the Kashag of the Tibetan Local Government, on behalf of all the monks and laypeople, expresses its sincere respect to you. In the past four years, the people of all fraternal nationalities of the motherland have been advancing on the road to happiness that you have pointed out, and various constructions have been unprecedentedly developed. In particular, the unparalleled strength of the motherland shown in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea has been praised by the people of the world. In just over two years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the unity between the People's Liberation Army and the Tibetan monks and laypeople has been strengthened day by day. The People's Liberation Army entering Tibet has not only consolidated national defense but also helped the Tibetan people develop agriculture, build roads, and establish people's hospitals and veterinary serum factories. Unprecedented construction projects are constantly achieving results. The Dalai Lama has already stated these details in his telegram to you. We have firm confidence in the increasingly happy life and local prosperity of the Tibetan people in the future. Finally, we shout:
    Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of all fraternal nationalities in China!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
                    Respectfully submitted by the Kashag of the Tibetan Local Government
                      September 30, 1953

    达赖、班禅和西藏地方政府噶厦
    致电毛主席祝贺第四届国庆节
    【新华社拉萨三十日电】西藏地方政府达赖喇嘛在国庆节前夕致电毛主席致敬。中央人民政府伟大领袖毛主席：
    兹值中华人民共和国成立四周年之际，我们西藏地方除举行盛大庆祝外，我谨代表西藏全体僧俗人民亲切而兴奋地向您致敬祝贺。西藏人民自从获得和平解放回到祖国大家庭以后，两年多来，在您的正确领导下，在中央人民政府的正确领导下，已经和进藏人民解放军建立了兄弟般的亲密关系。在祖国开始第一个五年经济建设计划的第一年，全国各地各企业厂矿在完成上半年度的基本建设工作方面，取得了很大的成绩。西藏地区由于交通条件的限制，虽然还未能从事广泛的基本建设工作，但在中央人民政府和进藏人民解放军大力帮助之下，有关发展西藏未来建设事业的康藏公路正在修筑，并已取得很大成绩。至于过去帝国主义及国民党反动政府所造的谣言，现在完全证实其为挑拨破坏了，因为西藏全体僧俗人民所信仰的佛教和西藏地区的政治、经济、文化以及人民的生活都已得到进一步发展，在您和中央人民政府的正确领导和进藏人民解放军的帮助下，我们有完全肯定的信念可以把西藏建设得更加美好。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！

      【新华社拉萨三十日电】西藏班禅额尔德尼致电毛主席祝贺国庆节。电文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    当国庆节到来之际，我兴奋地想到：四年来，伟大的祖国在您英明正确领导下日益繁荣昌盛，祖国人民对保卫世界和平事业也作了重大的贡献，尤其是西藏和平解放两年来，各方面的建设事业也都得到发展。日喀则地区人民由于进藏中国人民解放军及工作人员的亲密帮助，各项建设工作都取得很大的成绩。去年和今年，农民们得到了无利贷粮、贷款，解放军还亲自指导农民兴修了水利，尤其是今年秋收前，农村里青黄不接，中央人民政府拨给救济款，及时地救济了很多家无存粮的农民，使他们渡过灾荒。农民们都说：毛主席的眼睛真亮啊！看清了我们的痛苦，我们要好好生产报答毛主席。解放军进驻日喀则地区以后，自己开荒生产，他们的庄稼、蔬菜都长得特别好，农民都提出向解放军学习，浇水、锄草、上肥也都比往年注意，今年又得到了丰收。
    敬爱的毛主席：日喀则的小学办得很好，学生们的学习成绩都使家长们非常满意。日喀则的爱国青年文化联谊会筹备委员会成立刚刚两月，会员已增加到一百多人，这个组织已使青年们更加亲密团结。解放军的负责干部还经常给他们上课，使青年们进一步认识了祖国的伟大，学习到很多新的知识。日喀则的商业和手工业，在人民银行和国营贸易公司贷款、订货的扶植下，也开始空前繁荣起来，现在日喀则又在兴建人民医院和住宅。这些事情，使西藏人民深深地体会到，只有在您的领导下，和祖国各兄弟民族亲密团结起来，西藏人民才能得到自由和幸福。西藏致敬团回到西藏后，我听到了您对西藏建设的各项指示，更使我感到您对西藏人民的深切关怀和祖国大家庭的温暖，我们一定遵照您的指示，加强民族内部的团结，和人民解放军一起，把西藏建设得更加美好，和祖国各兄弟民族人民一齐前进！班禅额尔德尼九月二十四日
   【新华社拉萨三十日电】西藏地方政府噶厦于一九五三年国庆节前夕致电毛主席祝贺。电文如下：中国各族人民的领袖毛主席：
    在我们伟大祖国成立第四届国庆全国举行盛大庆祝的时候，西藏地方政府噶厦代表全体僧俗人员向您深致诚恳的敬意。四年来祖国各兄弟民族人民都在您所指示的安乐的康庄大道上前进，各种建设得到空前的发展，尤其是抗美援朝中所表现祖国无比的强大力量，已为全世界人民所称誉。西藏在和平解放后仅两年多的时间中，人民解放军和西藏僧俗人民的团结已经一天比一天加强，进藏的人民解放军不仅巩固了国防，而且还帮助西藏人民发展农业，修筑公路，建立人民医院和兽疫血清厂等。空前的建设事业正不断获得成绩，此项详情达赖喇嘛已经在他向您报告的电文中说过，我们对于今后藏族人民的生活日臻美满和地方繁荣都具有坚定的信心。最后我们高呼：
    中国各兄弟民族的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
                    西藏地方政府噶厦谨上
