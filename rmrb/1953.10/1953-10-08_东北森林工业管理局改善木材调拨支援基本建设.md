    The Northeast Forest Industry Administration has adopted various effective measures to correct the phenomena of timber depletion and non-compliance with specifications, and vigorously support basic construction.
    In view of the fact that the timber supply task for the first quarter only completed 89 percent of the state target, and the phenomenon of timber depletion and non-compliance with specifications and quality occurred continuously, affecting the supply of timber for basic construction, the Bureau formed an inspection team in conjunction with the Central Ministry of Forestry and major material-requiring units. In the second quarter, the inspection team went to Liaodong, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Yichun and other forest areas for inspection. During the inspection, it was found that the past production plans were not realistic, and the survey of the logging area was not accurate. Some surveyors only stood on the top of the mountain and judged the reserves, tree species, and forest farm grades; some only selected standard plots and extrapolated, and adding greed for more and quick results, it affected the accuracy of the survey data even more; afterwards, the plans were not handed over to the workers for discussion. As a result, the tree species required for felling were often insufficient, and the unnecessary ones were excessive, so that the tree species were not right or the specifications were not met when allocated. The forest railway transported whatever it encountered, and there was no unified management or dispatching agency, and the production and transportation were extremely uncoordinated; furthermore, both the supply and demand sides did not sufficiently recognize the important significance of timber supply in economic construction, which also caused many difficulties for the supply work. The management of storage yards has always been a weak link in the forest industry sector. There is no complete responsibility system, and the timber acceptance procedures are not strictly followed, and whatever is transported is accepted, and the distinction of grades is not strict. Some storage yards are even without responsible persons. Even Song, the director of the Nancha Forest Industry Branch Bureau, openly ordered the storage yard to say: "No need to pile up." As a result, all kinds of timber were piled up in the yard and could not be allocated; in addition, some material-requiring departments, regardless of the specific circumstances, all wanted first- and second-class coniferous trees, not broad-leaved trees, and wanted long timber but not short timber. For example, the paper-making materials claimed by the Central Ministry of Light Industry were originally stipulated to be white pine with a diameter of six centimeters, but as a result, white pine with a diameter of eighteen centimeters, which was used as building material, was taken away.
    In order to fundamentally improve the timber allocation work, the Northeast Forest Industry Department has transferred the logging area survey work from the operation department to the planning department for unified management, and has established a special management agency to control the production, transportation and sales according to the plan. In August, a mass inspection of the implementation of the production plan was carried out, focusing on checking the completion quality, exposing the serious waste caused to the country due to "emphasizing quantity over quality", especially checking the impact on basic construction. Based on the loopholes found in the inspection, a system of production responsibility, product acceptance, rewards and punishments, and worker learning was established; as for strengthening the management of storage yards, the Bureau is conducting key experiments in Sanchazi, Tieli, Shuangzihe and other storage yards, and will promote them comprehensively after gaining experience. In order to closely integrate production and sales, the Bureau is studying the method of the forest industry department being responsible for the safe delivery of timber according to the timber species and specifications stipulated by the material-requiring units, overcoming the blind allocation phenomenon of "producing from the top and selling from the bottom, selling empty mountains", so as to further ensure the timely and accurate supply for basic construction.

    东北森林工业管理局改善木材调拨支援基本建设
    东北森林工业管理局采取各种有效措施，纠正木材拨空及规格不符现象，大力支援基本建设。
    该局鉴于第一季度木材供应任务只完成国家指标的百分之八十九，且不断发生拨空及规格质量不符的情况，影响了对基本建设木材的供应，特组成检查组配合中央林业部及主要需材单位，于第二季度分别到辽东、吉林、黑龙江、伊春等林区进行检查。检查中，发现过去的生产计划不切合实际，伐区调查不准确，有的调查的人只站在山头一望，就判断出蓄积量、树种、林场等级；有的只选标准地，进行推算，加以贪多图快，就更影响了调查资料的准确性；事后计划又未交给工人讨论，结果，需要采伐的树材种往往不够，不需要的又多出来，以致分配时，不是树材种不对就是规格不符。森林铁路则遇到什么就运什么，也没有统一的管理、调度机构，产运极不协调；并且供需双方对木材供应在经济建设中的重要意义还认识不足，也给供应工作造成许多困难。贮木场的管理工作一向是森林工业部门的薄弱环节，没有完整的责任制度，又不严格遵守木材缴库手续验收木材，运到什么收什么，对品等区分也不严，有些贮木场还存在无人负责现象。甚至像南岔森林工业分局宋局长竟公然命令贮木场说：不用归楞。结果各色木材都堆在楞场支拨不出去；另外，有的需材部门不管具体情况如何，都一概要一、二等针叶树，不要阔叶树，要长材不要短材。如中央轻工业部领的造纸材，原规定是径级六公分的白松，结果硬把作为建筑材的径级十八公分的白松要去了。
    为使木材支拨工作求得根本改进，东北森林工业部门已将伐区调查工作，由作业部门移交计划部门统一管理，并成立了专门管理机构，掌握按计划生产、运材和推销。并于八月份开展了群众性的生产计划执行情况大检查，着重检查完成质量情况，揭发由于“重量轻质”给国家造成的严重浪费，特别是检查对基本建设的影响。根据检查出来的漏洞建立起生产负责、产品验收、奖惩及工人学习等制度；至于加强对贮木场的管理方面，该局正在三岔子、铁骊、双子河等贮木场进行重点试验，取得经验后全面推广。为了使产销密切结合，该局正在研究由森林工业部门按需材单位所规定的材种规格负责木材保送办法，克服“上产下销，指山卖空”的盲目调拨现象，以进一步保证对基本建设的及时、准确供应。
