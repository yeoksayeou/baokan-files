How Trade Unions Assist Administration in Improving Planning Management and Responsibility Systems to Exceed National Tasks
Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the China Metal Smelting Trade Union, Zhao Guoqiang

Experiences of Labor Emulation in Steel Industry Factories and Mines in the First Half of the Year

In the first half of this year, many factories and mines under the Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry carried out labor emulation.

From the perspective of the trade union's leadership work, this year's labor emulation has some new characteristics. This is because after studying the experience of the Wusan Factory, the resolutions of the expanded meeting of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' Party Group, and the resolutions of the Seventh Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, trade union cadres have further strengthened their production-oriented thinking; further clarified their understanding that organizing labor emulation is the central task of trade union work; and closely cooperated with the administration in improving various aspects of enterprise management. The development trend of the emulation movement has taken on new developments compared to the past. Specific experiences can be summarized into the following five points:

I. Organize Emulation Around the Implementation of Work Plans. According to the requirements of the work plan and production instruction charts, formulate measures plans for groups while ensuring safety and balanced production; organize production meetings to study and solve key problems in production, promote advanced experiences in a planned manner, and review the quality of emulation and evaluate the results of emulation based on the degree of completion of the work plan. In this way, the equilibrium of production can be improved, avoiding the impulsiveness of emulation; the comprehensive completion of national plans can be promoted, reducing the one-sided phenomenon of only focusing on output, neglecting quality, safety, and cost in emulation; and leaders and the masses can be clear-minded, which is convenient for studying production, finding key points, and exploring potential. As a result, planning management has gained a solid mass base, and planning has become the conscious action of the masses, promoting the gradual normalization of labor emulation.

II. In the process of compiling and implementing work plans, identify weak links hindering the realization of work plans, grasp key points, propose topics, mobilize the masses to find solutions, tap potential, put forward rationalization proposals, promote advanced experiences, and implement Soviet expert suggestions. This is a basic link in assisting the administration in improving work plans. For example, the experience of mechanization movement in Anshan Iron and Steel and the "topic challenge" in Tangshan Steel Plant have played a great role. However, in the competition, not enough attention is paid to improving product quality, strengthening equipment maintenance and machine repair, and ensuring safe production. The handling of tricks and rationalization proposals is not timely and frequent enough. In the promotion of advanced experience, there are still phenomena of not summarizing, not promoting, or randomly promoting.

III. This year, various places have begun to promote production meetings in the competition. It is developed on the basis of the original furnace front meetings, technical research meetings, technical coordination meetings, type of work meetings, professional meetings, and Zhuge Liang meetings. The content of production meetings in some places is to check the implementation of work plans based on daily original records, consolidate and promote good experiences, and propose topics to solve key problems that hinder production progress. According to the experience of various places, to hold good production meetings, there must be preparation, content, the issues discussed must be focused and realistic, the time should be short, and the problems must be truly solved, so as to gain the support of the masses.

IV. At present, there are about four forms of labor emulation: some are based on groups, some are based on shifts, some are based on furnaces, and some include vertical and horizontal emulations between groups, shifts, furnaces, and workshops. The first three are relatively simple, and the latter is more complex, but the benefit of the latter is that it can establish advanced banners from all aspects to promote the backward, and avoid the phenomena of championshipism, departmentalism, and conservatism caused by simply using a certain form to organize emulation. It can promote workers to establish an overall concept and make the competition a collective, revolutionary friendship competition. Therefore, this form of vertical and horizontal competition is worth promoting.

V. Promoting the work of departments and organizing department personnel and engineering and technical personnel to participate in the competition has begun in various places. This is a very important aspect of the trade union organization's production-oriented approach and organization of labor emulation. The current problem is that many trade union cadres do not understand the work of the departments and are not familiar with the department's business, so they cannot start. According to existing experience, to do a good job in the departments, first, we must understand the specific situation of the departments' work in each period, and according to the requirements of the work plan, help the departments formulate specific work plans so that the work of the departments is closely connected with the work of the workshops. Secondly, we should select key points and cultivate advanced individuals and advanced groups in a planned way to promote the overall situation. Attention should be paid to improving the relationship between department personnel and workers, so that enterprise management and production are closely integrated. Finally, special attention should be paid to strengthening the political and ideological education of department personnel with specific examples.

However, it must also be pointed out that the above experiences have only begun to take effect in a few units, and the following serious shortcomings still exist in the labor emulation of most factories and mines:

I. Lack of attention to studying the content of labor emulation. Failure to consider how to combine labor emulation with the central work of improving enterprise management in each period.

II. Many trade union cadres do not pay enough attention to the important measures taken by the administration to strengthen planning management, especially the implementation of work plans and the responsibility system. Some trade union cadres mistakenly believe that improving enterprise management is the responsibility of the administration, and the trade union can ignore it; some trade union cadres say that "as long as the administration reports well, the trade union can mobilize well," so they only circle around the methods of guaranteeing. In this way, they are unwilling to painstakingly study the central work of each period, and if they do not understand and do not understand, they cannot mobilize the masses well, and they cannot guarantee it.

Current Situation and Tasks of Trade Unions

Although the production situation in the first half of this year has greatly improved compared with last year, and some units have not only been able to complete the national plan, but also the equilibrium rate has increased, the production situation of many factories and mines is not good enough. From the perspective of the Steel Industry Administration Bureau system, except for ore and coke, the main products have not completed the plan. The state of low quality, many accidents, large waste, and uneven production with looseness at the beginning and tightness at the end has not been fundamentally changed. Therefore, how to ensure the completion and over-completion of the national plan has become a serious task for trade unions.

At present, some factories and mines are still in the initial stage of doing a good job in work plans, and work plans have only played a role in a few factories and mines. In the future, we must still grasp the two major links of work plans and responsibility systems to complete the national plan. Therefore, the task of the trade union is to assist the administration in implementing work plans, improving planning management, establishing and improving the responsibility system, carrying out labor emulation, and comprehensively, balancedly, and over-fulfilling the national production tasks. And around this task, improve trade union work in a planned way, and gradually establish a normal order of trade union work. To this end, the following points must be specifically achieved:

I. Summarize the experience of labor emulation in the first half of the year, affirm achievements, and criticize shortcomings. Organize trade union cadres to seriously study and research work plans, assist the administration in implementing work plans, and mobilize the masses around work plans to specifically formulate measures plans for classes, groups, and auxiliary departments. And mobilize the masses to find solutions, promote advanced experiences, and seriously implement Soviet expert suggestions. In the emulation movement, establish, improve, and promote group production meetings, and gradually establish section, workshop, and factory-level production meetings according to different situations. At present, we should focus on doing a good job in group production meetings. At present, some factories and mines have established or are establishing collective contracts. The trade union should attach importance to strengthening education for employees through contract forms, so that employees clearly recognize the consistency of personal interests and national interests, and use the contract as the goal of the competition.

In the case that the work plan and dispatch work are not sound, the contact of the contract is still needed. It can mainly solve the problem of contact and cooperation between workshops and workshops, and between working sections, in order to ensure the close cooperation of each working section and workshop, and to achieve the requirements of balanced production.

II. Assist the administration in establishing and improving the responsibility system. Trade union cadres should clearly recognize that assisting the administration in establishing and improving the responsibility system is to further consolidate and ensure the realization of work plans from the organizational and system levels. We must mobilize the masses to find problems, make suggestions, and overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible. And at the same time as the responsibility system is established, we must also conduct education for employees on strengthening compliance with labor discipline and operating procedures through criticism and self-criticism, so that the responsibility system can be established on the basis of the conscious supervision and conscious compliance of the broad masses.

III. Further improve trade union work. First of all, trade union work must be done well under the leadership of the Party, unifying thoughts, unifying steps, and obtaining the support of the administration and the cooperation of the League. In some grass-roots organizations, there are still practices of doing things in their own way, and some trade union cadres do not report to the Party committee or ask for instructions on their work, and do not actively cooperate with the administration to do a good job in the central work. These phenomena must be overcome.

Secondly, trade union cadres must learn enterprise management and production knowledge. At present, the tasks facing the trade union are all new problems. If trade union cadres do not understand enterprise management and production, they cannot cooperate well with the administration to improve enterprise management, let alone improve their own work.

Thirdly, attention should be paid to overcoming formalism, bureaucratism, and decentralism, so that trade union cadres firmly grasp the central work of each period, go deep into the groups, create experience, accumulate experience, conscientiously do a good job in group work, and study how to adjust various organizational forms of the trade union, how to establish various systems, and how to allocate employees' spare time according to the requirements of enterprise management and production, so as to establish a normal order of trade union work in a planned way.

    工会如何协助行政搞好计划管理和责任制超额完成国家任务
    中国五金冶炼工会筹备委员会主席　赵国强
    钢铁工业各厂矿今年上半年
    开展劳动竞赛的经验
    今年上半年，重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属不少的厂矿开展了劳动竞赛。
    今年的劳动竞赛从工会的领导工作来看，有一些新的特点。这就是由于学习了五三工厂经验及全国总工会党组扩大会议决议以及中国工会第七次代表大会的决议后，工会干部更进一步加强了面向生产的思想；进一步明确认识到组织劳动竞赛是工会工作的中心任务；并密切配合了行政方面改善企业管理的各项工作。竞赛运动发展的趋势，与以往相比已有了新的发展。其具体经验可归纳为以下五点：
    一、围绕贯彻作业计划组织竞赛。根据作业计划和生产指示图表的要求，在保证安全和均衡生产的原则下，订好小组的措施计划；组织生产会议，研究和解决生产中的关键问题，有计划地推广先进经验，并根据作业计划完成的程度来审查竞赛的好坏和评比竞赛的结果。这样，就可以提高生产的均衡性，避免竞赛中的突击性；可以推动全面地完成国家计划，减少竞赛中的只重视产量、忽视质量、忽视安全和成本的片面现象；可以使领导和群众心中有数，便利于研究生产、找寻关键、发掘潜力。结果计划管理获得了雄厚的群众基础，计划变成了群众的自觉行动，推动了劳动竞赛逐步地走向正常化。
    二、在编制和贯彻作业计划的过程中，找寻阻碍作业计划实现的薄弱环节，抓住关键，提出课题，发动群众找窍门，挖潜力，提合理化建议，推广先进经验，贯彻苏联专家建议，这是协助行政搞好作业计划的基本环节。例如鞍钢开展机械化运动的经验，唐山钢厂的“课题擂台”，都起了很大作用。但是竞赛中对提高产品质量、加强设备维护和机器检修和保证安全生产方面注意的还不够，处理窍门和合理化建议还不及时、不经常，先进经验的推广方面，还存在有不总结、不推广或乱推广的现象。
    三、在今年竞赛中各地已开始推行生产会议，它是在原有的炉前会、技术研究会、技术碰头会、工种会、专业会、诸葛亮会的基础上发展起来的。生产会议的内容，有的地方是依据每日的原始记录，检查作业计划执行的情况，对好的经验加以巩固推广，对障碍生产前进的关键问题提出课题加以解决。根据各地的经验，要开好生产会议，必须有准备、有内容，讨论的问题要集中、现实，时间要短，要真正解决问题，这样才会获得群众的拥护。
    四、目前劳动竞赛的形式约有四种：有的是以组为单位，有的是以班为单位，有的是以炉为单位，还有的是包括了组与组、班与班、炉与炉、车间与车间的纵横竞赛。前三种较为单纯，后一种较为复杂，但后者的好处是可以从各方面树立先进旗帜，以推动落后，并可避免单纯地运用某一形式组织竞赛所引起的锦标主义、本位主义和保守主义的现象，可以促进工人树立整体观念，使竞赛真正成为集体主义的、革命友谊的竞赛。因此，这种纵横竞赛的形式是可以推行的。
    五、推动科室工作，组织科室人员和工程技术人员参加竞赛，各地已开始进行。这是工会组织面向生产，组织劳动竞赛的一个很重要的方面。目前的问题是许多工会干部不了解科室工作，不熟习科室业务，因而无法下手。根据已有的经验，要做好科室工作，首先要了解每个时期科室工作的具体情况，并根据作业计划的要求，帮助科室订出具体的工作计划，使科室工作和车间工作密切衔接起来。其次应选出重点，有计划地培养先进人物、先进小组，以推动全盘。要注意改善科室人员和工人的关系，使企业管理和生产密切结合起来。最后还要特别重视以具体事例加强对科室人员的政治思想教育。
    但是，也必须指出，以上这些经验仅在少数单位中开始发生作用，而在多数厂矿的劳动竞赛中还存在以下严重缺点：
    一、不注意研究劳动竞赛的内容。不考虑如何使劳动竞赛和每个时期改善企业管理的中心工作结合起来。
    二、不少工会干部对行政上加强计划管理，特别是对贯彻作业计划与责任制的重要措施重视不够。有的工会干部错误地认为改善企业管理是行政的事，工会可以不去过问；有的工会干部说“只要行政报告得好，工会就可发动得好”，因而只从保证的方法上打圈子。这样，即不肯艰苦地去钻研每个时期的中心工作，自己不了解，不懂，就不能很好地发动群众，也就无法保证。
  目前的情况和工会的任务
    今年上半年的生产情况虽比去年有很大进步，有些单位不仅能够完成国家计划，而且均衡率也提高了，但还有许多厂矿完成生产的情况是不够好的。从钢铁工业管理局系统看，除矿石、焦炭外，主要产品均未完成计划。质量低、事故多、浪费大和生产上前松后紧不均衡的状态，仍未得到基本改变。因此，如何保证国家计划的完成和超额完成就成为工会的严重任务了。
    目前，若干厂矿在搞好作业计划方面，还处于开始阶段，作业计划仅在少数厂矿起了作用，今后仍要抓住作业计划和责任制度两大环节去完成国家计划。因此，工会的任务，就是要协助行政贯彻作业计划、搞好计划管理，建立与健全责任制度，开展劳动竞赛，全面地均衡地超额完成国家生产任务。并围绕这一任务有计划地改进工会工作，逐步建立工会工作的正常秩序。为此就要具体作到以下几点：
    一、总结上半年的劳动竞赛经验，肯定成绩，批判缺点。组织工会干部认真地学习和研究作业计划，协助行政贯彻作业计划，并围绕作业计划发动群众具体制订班、组和辅助部门的措施计划。并发动群众找窍门，推广先进经验，认真地贯彻苏联专家建议。要在竞赛运动中建立、健全和推广小组的生产会议，并根据不同情况，逐步地建立起工段的、车间的以及厂级的生产会议。目前应着重搞好小组生产会议。目前有些厂矿已经订立或正在订立集体合同。工会要重视通过合同形式加强对职工教育，使职工明确认识到个人利益和国家利益的一致性，将合同作为竞赛的奋斗目标。
    在作业计划和调度工作还不健全的情况下，联系合同仍是需要的。它主要可以解决车间与车间、工段与工段的联系配合问题，以保证各工段和各车间的紧密配合，而达到平衡生产的要求。
    二、协助行政建立与健全责任制度。要使工会干部明确认识到协助行政建立和健全责任制度，就是进一步从组织上、制度上巩固和保证作业计划的实现。要动员群众找问题，提建议，去克服无人负责的现象。并在责任制度建立的同时，很好地通过批评和自我批评对职工进行加强遵守劳动纪律和操作规程的教育，使责任制度能够建立在为广大群众自觉监督和自觉遵守的基础上。
    三、进一步改进工会工作。首先工会工作必须在党的领导下，统一思想，统一步调，并取得行政的支持、团的配合才能做好。有的基层组织中还存在着各搞一套的做法，有的工会干部不向党委汇报、请示工作，在工作中也不主动地配合行政搞好中心工作，这些现象都必须克服。
    其次，工会干部必须学习企业管理和生产的知识。目前摆在工会面前的任务都是些新问题，如工会干部不懂企业管理和生产，即不能很好地配合行政改善企业管理，更无法改进自己的工作。
    再次，要注意克服形式主义、事务主义、分散主义现象，使工会干部紧紧地掌握住每个时期的中心工作，深入小组，创造经验，积累经验，认真做好小组工作，并根据企业管理和生产的要求去研究工会的各种组织形式如何调整，各种制度如何建立，职工的业余时间如何支配，以便有计划地去建立工会工作的正常秩序。
