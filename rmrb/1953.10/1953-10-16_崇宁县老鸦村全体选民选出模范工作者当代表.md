Reader's Letters Summary

    All Voters in Laoya Village, Chongning County, Elect Model Worker as Representative
    Cai Chengxuan of the Chongning County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Sichuan Province writes: At the election meeting in Laoya Village, Lingsheng Township, Chongning County on August 27th, all voters unanimously elected Wu Xiang (a Communist Party member), the chairman of the Farmers' Association, as a people's representative.
    Comrade Wu Xiang, born into a poor peasant family, suffered for many years in the old society. After liberation, under the education and cultivation of the Party, he actively served the masses and was loved by them. He has made many achievements in leading production. For example, during the spring plowing last year, the masses had many concerns about the advanced farming method of sparse seedlings and dense planting. In addition to patiently publicizing the method, Wu Xiang used his own practical actions to encourage most farmers to accept sparse seedlings and dense planting. After the autumn harvest, the village's more than 1,000 mu of land saw an average yield increase of 20 percent. During the spring plowing this year, he again called on the masses to continue to promote the method of sparse seedlings and dense planting, and mobilized the masses to help individual farmers and households without labor solve difficulties in production. He himself chopped more than five mu of broad beans and planted nearly three mu of land for the Yin Xushi and Zhang Yangshi families, who lacked labor.
    Wu Xiang is selfless in his work and cares about the interests of the masses. Before the spring plowing last year and this year, he had some difficulties in production, but he always conscientiously assisted the cadres of the People's Bank in their loan work and never made any requests for himself. This year, the masses took the initiative to ask the People's Bank to give him a loan, but he refused, saying, "I still have four or five sheng of rice, and I can sell some firewood to overcome the temporary difficulties. Let's take care of the others first!" The masses were very moved by this. Affected by Wu Xiang, military dependent Granny Liao found a way to solve her difficulties on her own and gave the loan to others who needed it more.
    This July, when the village began its general election work, Wu Xiang had just recovered from a serious illness, but he forgot his fatigue and actively participated in the publicity work. Some cadres overcame their thoughts of switching shifts under his influence.
    Since 1951, Laoya Village has been rated as a model village in the county in the movement to donate to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and in the work of paying patriotic public grain, and Comrade Wu Xiang has also been rated as a model worker twice. After being elected as a people's representative, he responded to the call of the Party and led the masses to actively carry out the work of increasing production and practicing economy.

### 崇宁县老鸦村全体选民选出模范工作者当代表

专栏：读者来信摘要

    崇宁县老鸦村全体选民选出模范工作者当代表
    中共四川省崇宁县委员会蔡成选来信：八月二十七日崇宁县灵圣乡老鸦村的选举大会上，全体选民一致选出农会主席吴湘（共产党员）为人民代表。
    吴湘同志贫农出身，在旧社会受了多年的苦；解放后在党的教育培养下积极为群众服务，受到群众的爱戴。他在领导生产的工作中做出了不少成绩。如去年春耕时，群众对少秧密栽的先进耕作方法有很多顾虑，吴湘除了耐心宣传外，并用自己的实际行动来带动大部农民接受少秧密栽的办法。秋收后，全村一千多亩田，平均增产百分之二十。今年春耕时，他又号召群众继续推行少秧密栽的办法，并发动群众帮助单干农民和无劳动力户解决生产中的困难。他自己给缺乏劳动力的尹徐氏、张杨氏两户就铡了五亩多的苕子和种了将近三亩的地。
    吴湘在工作中大公无私，关心群众利益。去年和今年的春耕前，他在生产中有些困难，但他总是认真地协助人民银行的干部作好贷款工作，自己从不提出任何要求。今年群众主动要求人民银行贷款给他，他却拒绝说：“我还有四、五升米，再卖些柴，暂时的困难可以克服了。还是照顾其他人吧！”群众听了很受感动，军属廖大娘在吴湘的影响下，自己设法解决了困难，把贷款让给其他更需要的人了。
    今年七月，村里开始进行普选工作时，吴湘重病刚好，但他忘记了疲劳，积极参加宣传工作。某些干部在他的影响下克服了换班思想。
    老鸦村自一九五一年起，先后在抗美援朝捐献运动和缴送爱国公粮工作中被评为全县模范村，吴湘同志也两次被评为模范工作者。在当选人民代表后，他又响应党的号召，领导群众积极开展增产节约工作。
