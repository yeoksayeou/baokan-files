(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 24th) The Korean-Chinese side was still unable to carry out explanatory work on the 24th. On the evening of the 23rd, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission merely notified the Korean-Chinese side, saying, "No explanations tomorrow." Thus, the Korean-Chinese side's explanatory work for the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war under the custody of the Indian troops has not been conducted for even one minute during the past entire week.

However, during this week, eleven Korean-Chinese prisoners of war risked their lives to escape the terror control of the Li and Chiang Kai-shek special agents and applied for repatriation. Among them, three Korean People's Army prisoners of war escaped from the very camp designated for listening to explanations. They unanimously pointed out that the Li and Chiang Kai-shek special agents are taking this opportunity to intensify all kinds of intimidation and deception against the prisoners of war in the camp, and even carrying out cruel murders. The eleven returnees unanimously appealed to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to take effective action to rescue the prisoners of war trapped in the clutches of the special agents, and to ensure their safety and their right to express their desire for repatriation.

    朝中方面昨天仍然没有能够进行解释工作
    【新华社开城二十四日电】二十四日朝中方面仍然没有能够进行解释工作。二十三日晚中立国遣返委员会仅通知朝中方面说：“明日无解释。”至此，朝中方面对印度部队看管下的朝中被俘人员的解释工作，在过去的整整一个星期中连一分钟也没有进行。
    但在这一个星期中，有十一名朝中被俘人员冒着生命危险逃出了李、蒋特务的恐怖控制，申请遣返，其中有三名朝鲜人民军被俘人员就是从被指定听取解释的营场中逃出来的。他们一致指出：李、蒋特务正趁此机会在营场内加紧对战俘进行种种恫吓和欺骗，甚至进行残酷的谋杀。十一名归来人员一致吁请中立国遣返委员会采取有效行动解救陷在特务魔爪中的战俘们，保证他们的生命安全和表达遣返意愿的权利。
