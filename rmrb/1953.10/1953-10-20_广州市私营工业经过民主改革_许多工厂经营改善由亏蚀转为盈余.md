	Guangzhou's private industry accounts for 72 percent of the city's total industrial output. However, they share common characteristics: high product costs, poor quality, sluggish sales, lack of raw materials, backward management and technology, a lack of necessary systems or unsound systems, resulting in significant waste and widespread chaos. Furthermore, feudal foremen continued to oppress workers and undermine production unity after liberation, seriously hindering the development of production.
	In response to these circumstances, the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China began leading the broad masses of workers and staff in private factories to carry out democratic reforms in December last year, which concluded in August this year. Currently, a production increase and conservation campaign has been launched on the basis of democratic reform.
	The democratic reform movement in various factories has achieved great results, mainly reflected in varying degrees of improvement in the output and quality of products, improved management, reduced waste and unreasonable expenses, gradual reduction in costs, and increasingly normalized production. Some factories have turned from annual losses to profits. For example, the New Southwest Battery Factory lost over 380 million yuan last year. After the production reform, it not only made up for the losses but also had a surplus. The Guangqing Knitting Factory once applied for closure. After the production reform, it improved product quality and opened up sales channels. The capitalist no longer applied for closure but increased capital and expanded operations. Most factories can complete or overfulfill processing tasks. Secondly, the masses of workers have been basically mobilized, the class consciousness of the workers has been raised, and the idea of being masters of their own affairs has been established; the remaining feudal forces in the factories have been eliminated, the unity between employees has been strengthened, and the labor enthusiasm of the workers has been brought into play. For example, the Tiansheng Foundry once received an order from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, requiring completion within eleven days. The capitalist did not dare to accept it, fearing that it could not be completed. The workers realized the importance of this task, convinced the capitalist, and took the order, completing the task in seven days. Workers in fourteen factories in the North District proposed more than 650 rationalization proposals, of which more than 300 have been implemented. Production technology has been continuously improved. For example, workers at the Nanyang Electric Appliance Factory brought the potential of the machines into play, increasing production by 180 percent. The battery industry's output in August increased by 20 percent compared to July. Due to the increase in production, the capitalist's confidence in management has also been enhanced. The South China Sewing Machine Factory has added more than a dozen small lathes to expand production.
	The reasons for obtaining these achievements are mainly that the leadership has clarified the purpose of democratic reform, grasped the characteristics of private factories, and deeply solved the key problems in production. For example, the Jiangnan Carbon Factory started with reducing the scrap rate; the Quanxin Knitting Factory started with increasing output; the Jiehe Steel Factory started with educating workers to abide by labor discipline, thus ensuring the healthy development of the movement. Secondly, it is due to the assistance of the state-owned economy. In the past, many factories relied on self-management and self-sales, and products would be stockpiled in the off-season. Li Yuxing of the knitting industry is a larger factory with a good brand, but it had to suspend work for two months in the off-season. After the state-owned commerce and cooperatives processed, ordered, and underwrote products, normal production could be maintained even in the off-season. Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, many factories have begun to carry out production under a unified plan, gradually overcoming the blindness in production.
	However, there are still some problems in private factories, such as the quality of products is still poor, and a few capitalists, in order to pursue more profits, are unwilling to accept processing and ordering tasks, and are not actively improving production, intentionally producing shoddy products.

    广州市私营工业经过民主改革
    许多工厂经营改善由亏蚀转为盈余
    广州市私营工业占全市工业生产总额的百分之七十二，但存在着共同的特点：产品成本高，质量差，销路不畅，原料缺乏，经营管理和技术设备都很落后，没有必要的制度或制度不健全，因而开支浪费很大，普遍存在着严重的混乱状态；加上封建把头在解放后继续压迫工人，破坏生产团结，严重地阻碍了生产的发展。
    中国共产党广州市委员会针对这些情况，于去年十二月开始领导私营工厂的广大工人职员群众进行民主改革，今年八月已告结束。现在，已在民主改革的基础上展开了增产节约运动。
    各厂的民主改革运动获得很大成效，主要表现在各厂产品的产量和质量都有不同程度的提高，改善了经营管理，减少了浪费和不合理开支，成本逐渐降低，生产日益正常化。有些厂由过去年年亏蚀转为盈余。如新西南电池厂，去年亏蚀三亿八千余万元，生产改革后，不仅弥补了亏损，还有了盈余；广晴针织厂曾一度申请歇业，生产改革后，提高了产品质量，打开了销路，资方不再申请歇业，还增加了资金，扩大经营。大部分工厂都能完成或超额完成加工任务。其次，基本上发动了工人群众，提高了工人的阶级觉悟，树立了当家作主的思想；肃清了工厂中的封建残余势力，加强了职工之间的团结，发挥了工人的劳动积极性。如天生铸造厂有一次接到解放军某部定货一批，限期要十一天完成，资方不敢接，怕完成不了，工人认识到这个任务的重要，打通了资方思想，将订货接下来，结果七天便完成了任务。北区十四家工厂工人提出了六百五十余项合理化建议，已执行三百余项。生产技术不断提高，如南洋电器厂工人发挥了机器潜力，使生产提高百分之一百八十，电池业八月份产量比七月份增加百分之二十。由于生产的提高，也提高了资方经营信心，华南缝纫机厂增加了十几部小型车床，扩大了生产。
    获得这些成绩的原因，主要是领导上明确了民主改革的目的性，掌握了私营工厂的特点，深入地解决了生产上的关键问题。如江南炭素厂是从减低废品率入手；全新针织厂是从提高产量入手；捷和钢铁厂是从教育工人遵守劳动纪律入手，这样，使运动健康发展。其次，是由于国营经济的扶助。许多厂过去多靠自营自销，淡季产品就要积压；针织业李裕兴是较大的厂，牌子好，淡季也要停工两个月，经过国营商业、合作社加工、订货、包销产品后，淡季也能正常生产了。许多厂在国营经济领导下，开始在统一计划下进行生产，逐步克服生产上的盲目性。
    但是，目前私营工厂还存在一些问题，如产品质量仍然低劣，少数资本家为了追求更多利润，不愿接受加工订货任务，不积极改进生产，对产品有意粗制滥造。
