It was a summer morning. We – the first-year students of the Beijing Institute of Geology – wearing straw hats, carrying backpacks, and holding hammers, strode towards the mountain peak, each of us watching the stones along the road, examining every rock layer. We climbed and climbed, when suddenly someone ahead shouted, "Fossil plants found!" Hearing this cry of victory, everyone rushed up like soldiers hearing the charge, all wanting to see, casting envious glances at a piece of grey shale with the fossil of a fern leaf on it. Not far away, we discovered a shale layer with many plant fossils inside. The clanging of hammers and laughter instantly echoed through the valley. "Be careful!" someone shouted. "Don't break it!" another cried. Tang Chaogong discovered a fossil of a Calamites, jumping and shouting as he took it to the teacher, asking, "Teacher! Look, isn't it beautiful!" At this moment, no one cared about looking at other people's "booty," just hammering and knocking away. Strangely, the sound of a classmate's hammer suddenly stopped. I looked up at him and he was smiling. There was no need to ask; he must have discovered a satisfactory fossil. Little Liu stood motionless behind me, like a wooden man, his eyes staring straight at the fossil in his hand. Seeing me looking at him, he said with regret, "What a great big fossil! Stem and leaves are distinct. Damn it, I broke it." "Try again. There are fossils all over Jiulong Mountain. You can't use up all the hammers!" I comforted him.
    Everyone's backpack was heavier than when they came up the mountain, indicating that everyone had gained a lot.
    Jia Shi, who had been hammering for a long time on the sandstone layer above the shale, hadn't seen even the shadow of a fossil. He asked the teacher angrily and curiously, "Why are there so many fossils in shale, but it is difficult to find them in sandstone?" This question, which was not answered in the textbooks, sparked a debate among everyone. Each student had their own views, but the conclusion was only one: both the sandstone and shale of Jiulong Mountain are continental sedimentary rocks. In ancient times, when rivers carried stones, mud, and sand from the banks and riverbeds through lakes, the mud and sand began to settle due to the reduction in water speed. Of course, stones are heavier than mud and sand, so they settle first, while mud is lighter than sand, so it settles more slowly. In this way, after tens of millions of years, the mud and sand piled up layer by layer, and the pressure increased. After hardening and consolidation, the coarse gravel on the edge of the lake became conglomerate, the fine sand deposited further away from the lake shore formed sandstone, and the soil created shale. Jiulong Mountain was once a lake and swamp area in ancient times, full of soil, and various plants grew around it. After the plants died, they were buried in the soil and, after a long period of time, became fossils. Plants generally do not grow in sandy soil, because sand particles are larger than soil particles, and even if plants are deposited, it is not easy to preserve them completely to this day. Also, because sandstone is permeable and shale is impermeable, plant remains occasionally preserved in sandstone are easily destroyed by groundwater. Therefore, shale often contains fossils, while sandstone rarely does. The great nature of the motherland has enriched our theoretical knowledge.
    The team continued to move forward, and we climbed higher. Behind us were rolling hills, with the Yongding River flowing through them. In front of us was an endless plain, with green crops dotting the earth. In the distance, factory chimneys puffed out wisps of black smoke. The Yongding River stretched southeast like a yellow ribbon. The students used binoculars to observe the Yongding River in detail. It is a river that has "returned to its youth." Why do we say it has "returned to its youth"? Because rivers, like people, have their own childhood, prime, and old age. Rivers in their old age have winding channels, gently sloping valleys, slow currents, and deltas at their mouths. However, the Yongding River has very steep valleys. Why are the valleys so steep? Because the earth's crust has risen, increasing the slope of the riverbed, and the water flows downwards, enhancing its erosive power. As the saying goes, "Constant dripping wears away the stone." In this way, the river water has eroded the valley into steep cliffs. Steep valleys are a characteristic of rivers in their youth. We are not unfamiliar with rivers. Primary school students read about them in geography books, artists paint them, and poets and composers sing their praises... But only we geologists grasp their secrets.

    我们要揭开地层的秘密
    王文斗
    是一个夏日的清晨，我们——北京地质学院一年级同学，戴着草帽，背着背包，拿着锤子，迈步爬向山巅。每个人的眼睛盯着路旁的石头，察看着每一个岩层。爬呀爬，突然前边有人喊：“找到植物化石了！”大家听见这一个胜利的喊声，就像战士听见了冲锋号，蜂拥而上。“给我看看，”同学们争先恐后地抢着看，用羡慕的眼光投向一块灰色页岩，上边有一个羊齿植物叶的化石。没走多远，发现了页岩层，里边有很多植物化石。锤头的叮当声和欢笑声顿时响彻山谷。这边喊：“小心点！”那边喊：“别打碎了！”汤朝贡发现了一块轮木化石，就叫着跳着拿给老师看，问：“老师！你瞧，这多好看呐！”这时，谁也顾不得看别人的“战利品”了，只是一个劲儿地打着敲着。奇怪，一个同学的锤头声忽然停了。我抬头向他一看，他正微笑着。不用问，他一定是发现令人满意的化石了。小刘在我后边一动不动地在那里站着，活像个木头人，两只眼睛直瞪着手里的化石。他瞧我在看他，就用惋惜的口气对我说：“你瞧多好的大个化石呀！茎、叶分明。真该死，叫我打碎了。”“重来吧，九龙山上有的是化石，锤头是打不完的！”我安慰他说。
    每个同学的背包比上山时加重了，这说明大家都有了很多的收获。
    在页岩上边砂岩层打了半天化石的同学贾始，却连化石的影子也没看见。他气愤和好奇地问老师：“为什么页岩中化石这么多，而在砂岩中却不容易发现呢？”这个在书本上没有给予答复的问题引起了大家的争论。每个同学有各自的见解，但结论只有一个：九龙山的砂岩和页岩都是陆相沉积岩。古代河流带着沿岸和河床上的石子、泥沙流经湖泊时，因水速减小，泥沙、石子便开始沉积下来，当然，石子比泥沙重，就先沉积下来，而泥又比沙轻，也就沉积的慢了。这样经过几万万年，泥沙就一层层地堆积起来，压力也就加大，待硬化固结以后，在湖泊边沿的粗沙砾便成为砾岩，在离湖岸较远处沉积的细沙则形成砂岩，泥土则造成页岩。而九龙山在古代又曾经是一个湖泊、沼泽地带，到处都是泥土，在它的四周生长着各种植物，植物死后就被埋在土中，经过悠长的年代以后，便形成为化石。植物一般是不生长在沙土中的，因沙的颗粒要比泥土大，即便植物沉积下来，也不易完整地保存到现在；又因为砂岩容易透水，页岩不透水，偶而保存在砂岩中的植物遗体容易被地下水所破坏。因此，页岩中常常有化石而砂岩中却少有。祖国的大自然充实了我们的理论知识。
    队伍继续前进，我们爬得更高了。后边是起伏的山峦，永定河环流其间；前边是一望无边的大平原，绿油油的庄稼点缀着大地。远处，工厂的烟突冒出缕缕的黑烟。永定河像一条黄色的带子伸向东南。同学们用望远镜详细观察了永定河。它是一条“返老还童”了的河流，为什么要说它“返老还童”呢？因为河流和人一样，有它自己的幼年、壮年和老年。老年期的河流，河道曲折，河谷倾斜和缓，水流缓慢，河口形成三角洲。而永定河的河谷却很陡峻。为什么河谷会陡峻呢？因为地壳上升了，使河床的坡度加大，河水向下时，就增强了侵蚀力。俗语说：“水滴石穿。”这样，河水就把河谷侵蚀成陡崖；而河谷陡峻是河流幼年期的特征。对于河流，我们并不陌生，小学生在地理书上读到它，画家也画过它，诗人、作曲家歌颂它……但是掌握它的秘密的却只有我们研究地质的人。
