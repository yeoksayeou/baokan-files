    Jiangxi Ganzhou Normal School Decides to Improve Food Management and Environmental Sanitation
    A letter from Jiangxi Ganzhou Normal School: The "Reader's Letters Summary" column on June 19th published a "Comprehensive Summary of Reader's Letters" titled "The Issue of Students' Health Should Be Earnestly Emphasized," which criticized the shortcomings in our school's student food, dining hall, and dormitory surrounding environmental sanitation work. After inspection, the situation revealed by the readers is true. Although we made some improvements to student food and environmental sanitation work after May of this year, the problems have not been fundamentally resolved. This shows that our school leadership lacks a highly responsible spirit for the health of the younger generation. The readers' criticism is a powerful impetus for us. We guarantee that we will pay attention to improving students' health in the future and gradually improve food management and environmental sanitation work.

    江西省赣州师范学校决改进伙食管理和环境卫生
    江西省赣州师范学校来信：六月十九日“读者来信摘要”栏发表了“应该切实重视学生健康问题”的“读者来信综述”，其中对我校学生伙食和膳堂、宿舍周围环境卫生工作中的缺点提出批评。经检查，读者揭发的情况属实。今年五月后我们对学生伙食和环境卫生工作虽然作了一些改善，但问题未根本解决。这说明我们学校领导方面对青年一代的健康缺乏高度负责精神。读者的批评对我们是一个有力的督促，我们保证今后重视改善学生健康的工作，逐步改进伙食管理工作和环境卫生工作。
