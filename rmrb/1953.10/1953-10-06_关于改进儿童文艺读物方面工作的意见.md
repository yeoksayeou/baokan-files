In August, this newspaper published several articles on children's literature and art, raising some questions about various aspects of the current work in this field. To further understand the opinions of all parties and discuss future improvement measures, we held a forum. Representatives from the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Teaching Guidance Department of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, the Department of Children of the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of China, China Youth Publishing House, People's Fine Arts Publishing House, China Youth Daily, China Young Pioneers Newspaper, Xinhua Bookstore Children's Books Department, Beijing Library, Beijing Municipal Library, Beijing Fourth Middle School, and other units, as well as writers, teachers, and instructors attended the forum. Prior to this, this newspaper had successively received written opinions from comrades from various regions, including children's literature writers Chen Bochui and Huang Yiqing, the Youth League Municipal Committees' Children's Departments in Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Kunming, Shijiazhuang and other cities, New Young Pioneers Newspaper, teachers and instructors Liu Yuanzhang (Shanghai Zhaozhou Road Elementary School), Zheng Xiuluan (Shanghai Pingliang Road Elementary School), Qiao Yongjie (Tangmuqiao Central Elementary School, Chuansha, Jiangsu), Wang Huiyun (Tianjin Fifth District Central Elementary School) and Hejiatang Middle School, Hang County, Zhejiang, Changsha City reader He Guangxin, Harbin City reader He Yiling, as well as Shanghai Guangming Bookstore, Qiming Bookstore, Chunming Publishing House, Nitu Society, Yongxiang Printing House, Tianjin Popular Publishing House, and other publishing institutions. The following is a summary of the main points of the forum's speeches and written opinions from various locations. These opinions are worthy of attention.

  Love Children, Value Children's Literature

  Improve the Ideological and Artistic Quality of Children's Literature

Regarding the problems existing in the current children's literature and art, everyone once again reflected the unsatisfactory situation in children's literature creation: the vagueness of the themes, even the propagation of incorrect ideas; detachment from the reality of children's lives, violation of educational principles; formulaic and conceptual creation methods; stiffness and confusion in language and writing in creation and translation; and so on. Everyone believed that the root causes of the above situations should first be the writers' creative attitude, their attitude towards children, and their understanding of children's literature. Writer Xie Bingxin said: "Some of our children's literature writers not only do not love children, but also do not respect them. Their approach to children's literature creation is not serious and earnest, but casual. Writers are engineers of the human soul, and children's literature writers should be engineers who shape children's souls. Children may be young in age, but their souls are not small. If we do not respect our subjects, how can we write well?" Chen Zijun of the China Young Pioneers Newspaper, based on her experience in editorial work, reflected that some authors write very hastily, producing shoddy work, lacking a serious and responsible attitude. "They think that writing for children can be done casually, without the need to understand and study children's lives and social life in ordinary times, and that works do not need authenticity."

Wei Junyi pointed out a serious problem in some children's literature works today, which is using the adult's mindset to describe children, writing about children's "ideological transformation," their confession meetings, self-criticism sessions, and criticism struggles; writing about criticizing this or that "ism"; this is extremely wrong and violates our basic principles of children's education. Because writers are not very clear about these things that belong to the basic common sense of children's education, these erroneous works have fueled erroneous tendencies. These comrades need to contact the education departments and the Youth League organizations to become familiar with the principles and policies of children's education.

Only by writers correcting their creative attitude, loving children, loving children's literature, and improving the ideological and artistic quality in their creation, is it possible to improve.

Writer Ye Shengtao put forward five hopes for improving children's literature creation in the future: First, I hope that authors will often contact children, both at school and at home. With more contact, they will definitely understand the differences between today's children and those before liberation, so as to write about real children's lives. Second, I hope that authors will read some books on pedagogy and some books on child physiology and psychology. Reading these kinds of books can improve their perspective (but do not take the things in the books as dogma), and with a higher perspective, they should be able to write better works. Third, I hope that authors will pay more attention to language and writing. When children read children's books, they not only absorb the content of the books, but also learn language, and develop their language in the process of learning. Therefore, children's books are as important as school textbooks, and neither the content nor the language and writing can be sloppy. Fourth, there are few good children's books and many bad ones. Booksellers know that this is a good way to speculate and make profits, and everyone is drilling into this area, so naturally there are more bad things. We need more good works, so authors should work harder, not put down their pens and stop writing, and not hesitate, wanting to start but not starting immediately. If everyone discusses, studies, and criticizes more, better works can be produced. Fifth, we should encourage some painting friends to create illustrations for children's books. Like authors, painters also need to have more contact with children and read books about education and children. In addition, we should pay attention to basic painting exercises, first seeking correctness, then seeking vividness, and then seeking endless meaning beyond the painting.

These are precisely the common problems that exist in children's literature writers and works. Writers Jin Jin and He Yi both related their own creative activities at the meeting, pointing out that children's literature writers must delve into children's lives. Jin Jin said: "There are many touching things in children's lives, but we do not have enough understanding of children's good qualities, so we cannot talk about educating children with socialist ideas." He also believed that children's literature writers should become familiar with pedagogy and psychology, which should be the professional skills of children's literature writers. He Yi also hoped that the departments leading creation—the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the local literary associations—would pay more attention to the leadership of children's literature writers in the future. Everyone also requested that the relevant departments in Shanghai strengthen the leadership of children's literature writers in Shanghai, because except for a very few speculators, most writers are not willing to write bad works.

Writer Zhang Tianyi, on behalf of the Children's Literature Creation Group of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, proposed methods for improving the leadership of creative work in the future. He said: The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles will specifically help writers' creative activities in the future, helping them with ideological issues in creation, as well as with creative skills, which is our inescapable responsibility. We also hope that writers engaged in adult literature will care about the creation of children's literature works, because not only works that write about children's lives count as children's literature. In addition, in order to mobilize more people to engage in this work, we will discover and cultivate new creative forces from teachers, instructors, Youth League cadres, and other fields, and expand the ranks of children's literature and art creation. Only in this way can more and better literary and artistic works be produced. Only then can the ideological and artistic quality of children's literature creation be continuously improved.

  Improve Publishing, Distribution, and Promotion Work

  Make More Good Books Available to Readers

While demanding the creation of more and better literary and artistic works, it is necessary to improve publishing and distribution work.

Xing Shuntian of China Youth Publishing House and Xu Guangyu of People's Fine Arts Publishing House both described the publishing situation of their units. The literary and artistic works published by China Youth Publishing House in the past paid more attention to quality, but the quantity was not large; next year, it plans to publish about forty kinds of children's literary and artistic creations and translations. The People's Fine Arts Publishing House has published 29 kinds of comic books for children readers in the past three years, with a total print run of 1.29 million copies. Next year, it plans to publish a large number of comic books and will increase the proportion of topics for children. Some of them will be set in No. 4 type, explained, and printed in color. The People's Fine Arts Publishing House also requests that the literary and art circles provide scripts for comic books, because the scripts that determine the pictures are currently in an extremely scarce state.

On the issue of publishing topics, everyone requested that publishing institutions pay attention to the diversity of themes. Classical literary works and folk tales can be excerpted and rewritten. Our next generation now knows very little about our great ancestors. They do not know what kind of people Qu Yuan and Du Fu were, nor do they know what some of our heroic ancestors did. Writer Zhang Tianyi also hopes that various publishing houses can train some literary editors to rewrite some literary works and scientific knowledge articles that are suitable for children to read, because without proper rewriting, it is difficult for children to accept these kinds of works.

Participants in the forum criticized the bad practices of some private publishing institutions in dealing with children's books. These "briefcase bookstores" rarely or do not at all consider the sacred responsibility of educating the next generation, and even disregard the minimum seriousness that a legitimate publisher should have. These private businessmen collude with some idle literati, thinking that it is just a matter of fooling children anyway. They think that children will not protest or compare with the original text anyway, so they write and translate and publish haphazardly. Everyone requested that the publishing administrative departments pay serious attention to this kind of speculative behavior by petty bourgeois opportunists.

Everyone also raised some criticisms and suggestions for improvement regarding the cover design, binding, font, illustrations, and pricing of some current children's literary and artistic books. They requested that every book we give to children be clearly printed, with beautiful covers and illustrations, clear fonts, but with low prices.

In terms of distribution and promotion, everyone reflected that some relatively good literary and artistic works are often not found in bookstores, or are placed in remote corners; while some bad and toxic books are still displayed on the shelves of bookstores. Zheng Baorui of the Xinhua Bookstore Children's Books Department described their personal experience: "The people who sell books don't understand the books. Parents bring their children to buy books and ask what books are good? But we can't say. If this problem cannot be solved, no matter how good the attitude is, readers will always be dissatisfied." In this regard, the comrades of the bookstore proposed that in addition to striving to correct subjective shortcomings, they hope that newspapers and periodicals will often introduce some good children's literary and artistic works and criticize some bad ones. In this way, they can help them, and also help parents and children to choose books, so that every reader who wants to buy a book can buy a good book.

The Xinhua Bookstore's supply of children's books needs to be improved. The Youth League Municipal Committees' Children's Departments in several cities mentioned this situation in their written opinions. There are more than 30,000 elementary school students in Kunming, but the Xinhua Bookstore sells only three or four new children's books each month, with a total of more than 100 copies; there is also a month when no new books are added. In this way, those toxic comic books and old books have become the main spiritual food for children in their spare time.

Libraries play a great role in promoting and supplying literary and artistic works to children. Both the Beijing Library and the Beijing Municipal Library have taken the initiative to contact schools and Young Pioneers organizations to send books to schools. This kind of working spirit and promotion method is worth advocating. However, our public libraries and school libraries are ultimately too few, and the books for children in the cultural center reading rooms are mostly broken and tattered books left over from adults.

  Teachers, Team Organizations, and Parents

  Should All Guide Children's Reading of Literary and Artistic Books

The problem is not solved when the books reach the children's hands. It is not possible for children to read books without guidance.

Everyone talked about: the fact that children read bad books outside of class, are influenced by bad books, and are infected with bad thoughts and behaviors almost always occurs when no one is in charge, let alone guiding them. Some teachers and parents say: "It's better for children to sit there and look at comic books than to fight." A small number of teachers themselves are also reading bad books and even borrow them from children. Some teachers believe: "This is an extracurricular matter, and it is a matter for the government, the school, and the library, not my business." Many teachers and instructors rarely read literary books and children's literary books themselves.

Under this kind of view, how can sufficient attention be paid to the work of guiding reading? A teacher who manages a library said that the homeroom teachers in their school do not care about students' reading; the language teachers only care about teaching classes and do not guide students' extracurricular reading; the team organization and the library have no contact; in this way, the children all come to the library to find books to read in an unorganized and leaderless way, only seeking to read quickly, and cannot get more nourishment from the books. He Guangxin, a student at Changsha Hengxiang Middle School, wrote in a letter: "The language teachers in our school rarely recommend good books to students. Even if they do, they are just 'Zoya and Shura's Story', 'An Ordinary Soldier', etc., which everyone has already read. In the library of our school, there are many translated works, and most of these translated works are lengthy masterpieces, such as 'War and Peace', 'Madame Bovary', etc. Most of our students cannot understand this type of book."

Some teachers and team organizations have described their experiences in guiding reading work. These experiences prove that wherever school administration, team organizations, and teachers attach importance to guiding children's reading of literary and artistic books, significant results are achieved there. After a Young Pioneers squadron in Jiashan Road Elementary School, Shanghai, read "The Story of Zoya and Shura" and held a squadron meeting on "Zoya, Our Model," the whole class overcame the shortcomings of not studying seriously, being careless, and being afraid of difficulties; they improved their sense of responsibility for learning; and so far, they have maintained the fact that there is not a single student in the whole class with failing grades, and the total average grade of the whole class is above 80 points. The instructors of the Affiliated Elementary School of Yunnan Normal University have always attached importance to leading children's extracurricular reading of literary and artistic works. After reading "First Grade Elementary School Student," Ye Jiwen in the fifth grade wrote, "I want to be a people's teacher like Teacher Anna when I grow up." Since then, she has taken very good care of the young students in the kindergarten and lower grades at school, voluntarily sending them home after school, and even the noisy children listen to her quietly. There are many such examples.

  Establish an Institution with the Participation of Relevant Units

  Strengthen the Leadership of Children's Literature and Art Work

Based on the above situation, participants in the forum and comrades who submitted written opinions all put forward a unanimous opinion, which is: to improve the work of children's literary and artistic books in the future, the key lies in leadership.

Everyone believes that precisely because the problem of children's literary and artistic books involves all aspects, from creation, publishing, distribution, promotion, to guiding reading work, all need to be improved, and therefore it is not possible for any of the above units to solve it independently. These aspects must be valued and solved together, and under the unified leadership of the Party, the regular leadership of this work must be strengthened.

A suggestion was put forward at the meeting, which is: please consider whether an institution can be established. This institution can include the Children's Literature Creation Group of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Children's Department of the Central Committee of the Youth League, the publishing administrative departments and relevant publishing houses, bookstores, and libraries, as well as representatives from other relevant parties. With such an institution, the situation in all aspects can be exchanged, the opinions in all aspects can be concentrated for research, and the work of evaluation can be strengthened. Naturally, the establishment of such an institution does not mean that the leadership work in all aspects (such as creation, publishing, etc.) can be relaxed.

This suggestion still needs everyone to continue to study and discuss. However, the problem is very obvious: as long as all parties attach importance to this work and strengthen the leadership of this work, the improvement of children's literary and artistic books will have favorable conditions and reliable guarantees.

### 关于改进儿童文艺读物方面工作的意见

专栏：

    关于改进儿童文艺读物方面工作的意见
    本报在八月份曾发表了几篇有关儿童文艺读物的文章，对目前儿童文艺读物的各方面工作提出了一些问题。为了进一步了解各方面的意见和商讨今后改进办法，我们举行了一次座谈会。出席这次座谈会的有中华全国文学工作者协会、中央人民政府教育部教学指导司、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会少年儿童部、中国青年出版社、人民美术出版社、中国青年报、中国少年报、新华书店儿童读物门市部、北京图书馆、北京市图书馆、北京市第四中学等单位的负责人、作家、教师和辅导员等。在此以前，本报曾陆续收到一些同志从各地寄来的书面意见，其中包括儿童文学作家陈伯吹、黄衣青，上海、武汉、天津、杭州、昆明、石家庄等城市青年团市委少年部，新少年报，教师和辅导员刘元璋
  （上海肇周路小学）、郑秀鸾（上海平凉路小学）、乔永洁（江苏川沙唐墓桥中心小学）、王惠云（天津第五区中心小学）和浙江杭县贺家塘中学，湖南长沙市读者贺光鑫、哈尔滨市读者何奕玲，以及上海光明书局、启明书局、春明出版社、泥土社、永祥印书馆、天津通俗出版社等出版机构。下面综合了座谈会发言和各地书面意见的主要部分。这些意见都是值得重视的。
  热爱儿童，重视儿童文学事业
    提高儿童文学的思想性艺术性
    对目前儿童文艺读物中存在的问题，大家都再一次地反映了儿童文学创作方面不能令人满意的情况：主题思想的模糊，甚至宣传着不正确的思想；脱离儿童生活的真实，违反教育原则；公式化、概念化的创作方法；创作和翻译中语言文字的生硬和混乱；等等。大家都认为：产生上述情况的根源，首先应该是作家的创作态度问题，写作者对儿童的态度问题和对儿童文学的认识问题。作家谢冰心说：“我们有些儿童文学作家，不仅不热爱儿童，而且不尊重儿童。他们对儿童文学的创作，不是认真严肃的，而是随随便便的。作家是人类灵魂的工程师，儿童文学作家应该是塑造儿童灵魂的工程师。儿童年龄虽小，灵魂并不小。如果我们不尊重我们的对象，怎么能写得好呢？”中国少年报陈子君根据在编辑工作中的体会，反映了某些作者写作非常草率，粗制滥造，缺乏严肃负责的态度。“他们认为给儿童写东西可以随便一挥而就，不必在平时进行对儿童生活和社会生活的了解和研究，作品不需要真实性。”
    韦君宜指出今天某些儿童文学作品中的一个严重的问题，是在用成年人的一套去描写孩子，写孩子们的“思想改造”，写他们的坦白会、检讨会和批评斗争；写批判这个那个“主义”；这是极端错误的，违背我们的儿童教育的基本方针的。由于作家对这些属于儿童教育基本常识范围的东西都不太清楚，这些错误的作品就助长了错误的倾向。这些同志需要和教育部门、青年团组织取得联系，以熟悉儿童教育的方针和政策。
    作家只有端正创作态度，热爱儿童，热爱儿童文学事业，提高创作中的思想性和艺术性才有可能。
    作家叶圣陶对改进今后儿童文学创作提出了五点希望：一、希望作者经常接触儿童，学校里的，自己家里的。接触多了，一定会领会现在的儿童跟解放以前的儿童有什么不一样之处，从而写出些真实的儿童生活。二、希望作者看些教育学的书，看些儿童生理学、心理学的书。看这一类书可以提高眼光（切不要把书中的东西看成教条），凭较高的眼光该可以写出较好的作品。三、希望作者在语言文字方面多多注意。儿童看儿童读物，一方面吸收读物的内容，一方面就在学习语言，在学习语言中发展他们的语言。所以儿童读物跟学校课本同样重要，内容既不可马虎，语言文字也不可马虎。四、儿童读物好的少，不好的多。书商知道这是投机取利的好路道，大家向这方面钻，不好的东西自然多了。我们需要更多的好作品，因此作者该多多努力，不要搁笔不写，不要迟疑不决，想动手又不马上动手。大家多商量，多研究，多批评，比较好的作品是可以产生的。五、要鼓励一些绘画的朋友为儿童读物作画。跟作者一样，绘画的人也得多接触儿童，看些有关教育有关儿童的书。此外要注重绘画的基本练习，先求正确，次求生动，次求画外还有不尽的意味。
    这正是目前存在于儿童文学作家和作品中的普遍性问题。作家金近和贺宜，在会上都联系了自己的创作活动，指出儿童文学作家必须深入儿童生活。金近说：“儿童生活中感动人的事情很多，但是我们对儿童的优良品质不够了解，就谈不上以社会主义思想教育儿童了。”他也认为儿童文学作家应该把教育学、心理学搞熟，这应该是儿童文学作家的业务。贺宜并希望领导创作的部门——全国文学工作者协会和各地的文协今后更多地注意对儿童文学作家的领导。大家并要求上海的有关部门，加强对在上海的儿童文学作家们的领导，因为除掉极个别的投机分子以外，大部分的作家们并不是愿意写出坏作品的。
    作家张天翼代表中华全国文学工作者协会儿童文学创作组提出今后改进领导创作工作的办法。他说：全国文学工作者协会今后将具体帮助作家的创作活动，在创作思想问题上帮助他们，也在创作技巧方面帮助他们，这是责无旁贷的。也希望搞成人文学的作家们关心儿童文学作品的创作，因为并不是只有写儿童生活的作品才算儿童文学。此外，为了动员更多的人从事这一工作，将从教师、辅导员、团的干部及其他方面发现和培养新的创作力量，扩大儿童文艺创作的队伍。这样，才有可能产生更多更好的文艺读物。才有可能使儿童文学创作的思想性和艺术性不断地提高。
  改进出版、发行和推广工作
    使更多的好书都到读者手里
    在要求创作更多更好的文艺作品的同时，就必须改进出版工作和发行工作。
    中国青年出版社邢舜田和人民美术出版社徐光玉都叙述了本单位的出版情况。中国青年出版社过去出版的文艺读物，比较注意质量，但数量不多；明年准备出版四十种左右的儿童文艺创作和译作。人民美术出版社三年来出版了以儿童读者为对象的连环画册二十九种，总印数为一百二十九万册，明年准备出版大量的连环画册，将增加以儿童为对象的选题的比重，还有一部分用四号铅字排说明、用彩色印的。人民美术出版社并且要求文艺界供给连环画册的脚本，因为决定画面的脚本目前正处于极端缺乏的状态。
    在出版的选题工作上，大家都要求出版机构注意题材的多样性。古典文学作品、民间传说都可以节选和改写。我们的下一代现在对于我们伟大的祖先知道得很少，他们不知道屈原、杜甫是怎样的人，他们也不知道我们的一些英雄的祖先曾经做了些什么事情。作家张天翼并希望各出版社能培养一些文学编辑，改写一些适合儿童阅读的文学作品和科学知识文章，因为这一类作品，如果不经过适当的改写，孩子们是很难接受的。
    座谈会参加者都批评了某些私营出版机构对待儿童读物的恶劣作风。那些“皮包书店”，是很少或全不考虑教育下一代这一神圣职责的，甚至也不顾到一个正当的出版者所应有的起码的严肃作风。这些私商，勾结一部分无聊文人，认为反正是骗骗孩子的事，他们以为反正孩子们不会提抗议、不会去对照原文的，就胡乱地写，胡乱地翻译，胡乱地出版。对这种市侩主义者的投机行为，大家都要求出版行政部门予以严重的注意。
    大家也对目前的一些儿童文艺读物的封面设计、装帧、字体、插图和定价提出一些批评和改进的意见。要求我们给孩子们读的每一本书，都是印刷清楚，封面和插图美丽、字体清晰、但是定价低廉的。
    在发行和推广方面，大家都反映有些比较好的文艺读物，在书店里常找不到，或者放在偏僻的角落；而一些不好的、有毒素的读物，依然陈列在书店的架上。新华书店儿童读物门市部郑宝瑞叙述了他们亲身的体会：“卖书的人不了解书。家长们带了孩子来买书，问什么书好？可是我们说不出。不能解决这个问题，态度再好，读者总是不满意。”在这方面，书店的同志提出除掉努力改正主观上的缺点以外，希望报纸刊物经常介绍一些好的儿童文艺作品，批评一些坏的。这样，就可以帮助他们、也帮助了家长和儿童们选择书籍，使每一个要买书的读者都能买到好书。
    新华书店对儿童读物的供应工作需要改进。好几个城市的青年团市委少年部在书面意见上都提到这方面的情况。昆明市小学生有三万多人，但新华书店每月出售新的儿童读物，最多只有三四种，一共一百多册；也有一个月一本新书都没有增加。这样，那些含有毒素的连环画册和旧书便成为孩子们课余的主要精神食粮了。
    图书馆在推广和供给文艺读物给儿童的工作上有很大作用。北京图书馆和北京市图书馆都主动地和学校、少年先锋队的组织联系，把书送到学校里去，这种工作精神和推广办法，是值得提倡的。可是我们的公共图书馆和学校里的图书馆终究是太少了，文化馆阅览室里给孩子们看的书，又大都是成年人看剩下来的破烂。
  教师、团队组织和家长
    都应该指导儿童阅读文艺书籍
    书到了孩子们的手里，并不是问题就解决了，孩子们看书，没有指导是不行的。
    大家都谈到：孩子们课外去看坏书，受坏书的影响，沾染上不好的思想和行为，几乎都是在没有人管，更没人指导的情况下发生的。有的教师和家长说：“孩子坐在那里看连环图画，总比打架好。”少数的教师自己也在看坏书，还向孩子们借。有的老师认为：“这是课外的事，是政府、是学校和图书馆的事，不是我的事。”不少教师和辅导员自己很少阅读文艺书籍和儿童文艺读物。
    在这样的看法下，怎么会对指导阅读的工作引起足够的重视呢？有一位管理图书馆的教师说他们学校里班主任不管学生看书的事；语文教师只管上课，对学生课外阅读也不指导；团队的组织和图书馆也没有联系；这样，孩子们全是无组织、无领导地到图书馆来找书看，只求看得快，无法从书里得到更多的滋养了。长沙市衡湘中学学生贺光鑫来信说：“我们学校里语文老师很少向同学介绍什么好书，即使介绍，也只是人人都已经读过了的‘卓娅和舒拉的故事’、‘普通一兵’等等。在我们学校的图书馆里，翻译作品多，这些翻译作品又大多数是长篇巨著，如‘战争与和平’、‘包伐利夫人’等，这一类的书，是我们大多数同学看不懂的。”
    一些教师和团的组织都叙述了他们指导读书工作的经验。这些经验证明：凡是学校行政、团队组织、和教师们重视指导儿童阅读文艺书籍的地方，那儿就收到显著的效果。上海嘉善路小学一个少年先锋队中队读了“卓娅和舒拉的故事”，举行了“卓娅，我们的榜样”中队会以后，全班克服了学习不认真、粗心大意、害怕困难的缺点；提高了学习责任感；到目前为止，一直保持着全班没有一个有不及格功课的学生，全班成绩总平均在八十分以上。云南师范学院附属小学的辅导员们一直重视领导儿童课外阅读文艺作品，五年级的叶纪文读了“一年级小学生”以后，她写着“长大后要做一个像安娜老师那样的人民教师”，从此在学校里她对幼儿园低年级的小同学照顾得非常好，放了学自愿送他们回家，连会吵的小孩子也都安静地听她的话。像这样的例子是很多的。
  成立由有关单位参加的机构
  加强对儿童文艺读物工作的领导
    根据上面这些情况，座谈会参加者和提书面意见的同志都提出了一致的意见，即是：改进今后儿童文艺读物的工作，关键在于领导。
    大家认为：唯其因为儿童文艺读物的问题牵涉及各方面，从创作、出版、发行、推广、直到指导阅读工作上都需要改进，因而就不是上述哪一个单位能够独立解决的，必须这几方面都加以重视，共同解决，在党的统一领导之下，加强对这工作的经常性的领导。
    会上提出这样一个建议，就是：请各方面考虑是否可以成立一个机构。这个机构，可以包括全国文学工作者协会儿童文学创作组、青年团中央少年儿童部、出版行政部门和有关的出版社、书店和图书馆、以及其他有关方面的代表。有了这样一个机构，就可以使各方面的情况得到交流，各方面的意见可以集中进行研究，评介工作可以加强。自然，设立这样一个机构，一点也不意味着各方面（如创作、出版等）的领导工作就可以放松。
    这个建议还需要大家继续研究和商讨。但是，问题很明显，只要各方面重视这一工作，加强对这工作的领导，儿童文艺读物的改进，就有了有利的条件和可靠的保证了。
