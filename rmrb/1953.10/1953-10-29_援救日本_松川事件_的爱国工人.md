    Rescuing the Japanese "Matsukawa Incident" Patriotic Workers
    Xu Ming
    For more than four years, the American and Japanese reactionaries fabricated the Matsukawa train derailment incident in August 1949, illegally imprisoning twenty innocent Japanese patriotic workers in unjust prisons.
    Countless facts prove that the "Matsukawa Incident" was a political conspiracy planned by the American and Japanese reactionaries to persecute Japanese communists and patriotic workers and to strike at the Japanese peace and democracy movement. People know that after the surrender of Japanese militarism, the strength of the Japanese people grew with the strength of the world's people. In the January 1949 general election of the Japanese House of Representatives, the vanguard of the Japanese working class and the Japanese people—the Japanese Communist Party—won three million votes and gained thirty-five seats in the House of Representatives. The consciousness of the broad masses of the Japanese people rapidly increased, and they waged a resolute struggle against the crimes of the American and Japanese reactionaries in turning Japan into an American colony and military base. The American and Japanese reactionaries, fearing the development of the strength of the Japanese people, formulated the so-called "Fixed Number Law" in May 1949, which forced the limitation of the number of employees in government agencies and state-owned enterprises, and dismissed workers on a large scale. The number of workers dismissed from the national railway company system alone reached as many as 95,000. The American and Japanese reactionaries attempted to use this reactionary bill to "purge" Japanese communists and progressive trade union activists in government agencies and state-owned enterprises in one fell swoop. At that time, under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, Japanese workers, centered on the "Kokutetsu" (National Railway Company) workers, launched a nationwide struggle against layoffs. The Yoshida government, at the instigation of its American masters, fabricated the "Shimoyama Incident" and the "Mitaka Incident" at the same time that the first and second batches of large-scale layoffs were announced by "Kokutetsu" on July 5 and July 15 of the same year, in an attempt to frame the Japanese Communist Party, but both were shamefully defeated. Therefore, the American and Japanese reactionaries fabricated the "Matsukawa Incident," which had been carefully planned in advance.
    At 3:00 a.m. on August 17, 1949, the No. 412 up train on the Japanese National Railways Main Line heading for Tokyo derailed and overturned between Kanayagawa Station and Matsukawa Station in Fukushima Prefecture, killing the driver and two assistants. The next day, Masuda Kōkichi, Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Yoshida government in Tokyo, issued a statement falsely accusing this as a "violent act" by Japanese communists. Subsequently, in the month or so after the incident, the American and Japanese reactionaries successively arrested Suzuki Shin, Satō Hajime, and other twenty Japanese communists and patriotic workers who were at the forefront of the struggle against layoffs and against the intrusion of American capital into "Kokutetsu" and "Toshiba" (Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company), who were the main leaders of the Fukushima branch of the "Kokutetsu" trade union and the Matsukawa branch of the "Toshiba" trade union. Soon, the Fukushima District Public Prosecutor's Office in Japan prosecuted the twenty innocent defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident" to the Fukushima District Court with the fabricated "crime" of "conspiracy to overturn the train and murder." The court struggle carried out by the twenty innocent defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident" in the 94 trials of the Fukushima District Court exposed all the shameless lies of the reactionary prosecution authorities. The Fukushima District Court could not produce any conclusive evidence to prove the guilt of the innocent defendants, and dragged the case on for more than a year. In 1950, the United States launched the Korean War, and the American and Japanese reactionaries, in order to further suppress the Japanese peace and democracy forces, used unwarranted charges to "rectify" the Central Committee members of the Japanese Communist Party, closed the "Akahata" newspaper, and instructed the Fukushima District Court to sentence the twenty innocent workers of the "Matsukawa Incident" to death (five people), life imprisonment (five people), and long-term imprisonment on December 6 without any factual basis.
    It is obvious to all that the verdict of the Fukushima District Court in Japan is extremely absurd and unreasonable. For example: The "verdict" stated that five defendants, including Takahashi Haruo, went from Fukushima City to the scene of the accident, more than 20 li away, on the night of August 16, 1949, used bolt cutters to remove the railway spikes in two or thirty minutes, and rushed back to Fukushima City that night. However, not only did the family members who lived in the same room with the defendant and many colleagues of the defendant prove that these five people were indeed at home that night, but also Takahashi Haruo was seriously injured in the past due to official duties, with several fractures in his waist, and he is still a disabled person who has not fully recovered, and it is impossible to travel more than 50 li in the night in a short few hours. Two hospitals, Niigata and Fukushima, that had treated Takahashi in the past had written certificates confirming that he could not travel long distances. However, the Fukushima District Court illegally hid them. Isn't the conspiracy of the American and Japanese reactionaries to frame innocent people by using barbaric means obvious?
    The crime of the American and Japanese reactionaries in deliberately creating the "Matsukawa Incident" to murder Japanese patriotic workers has angered all people of conscience in Japan. After the innocent defendants revealed the truth of the "Matsukawa Incident" from prison, the Japanese people launched an increasingly widespread struggle to support them. According to statistics in May this year, more than six million people in Japan have signed petitions demanding the release of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." Many legal workers have voluntarily risen up to defend the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," forming a group of more than 170 lawyers, unprecedented in Japanese history. Many scientists and cultural workers have repeatedly organized delegations to investigate the "Matsukawa Incident" and reported to the broad masses of the people, thus making the truth of the "Matsukawa Incident" even clearer to the world.
    The crime of the American and Japanese reactionaries in fabricating the "Matsukawa Incident" to murder Japanese patriotic workers has also aroused the indignation of the working class and all righteous people in various countries around the world. Shortly after the Fukushima District Court announced its verdict, international workers' organizations such as the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, representing the will of millions of workers around the world, successively lodged serious protests with the Japanese Yoshida government, demanding the release of all innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," and sent letters of condolences to the twenty persecuted Japanese patriotic workers. Trade union organizations, people's organizations, and the broad masses of the people in many countries such as China, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Vietnam, India, and France, unanimously and resolutely protested against the fascist atrocities of the American and Japanese reactionaries, and warmly supported the just struggle of all innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." Tens of thousands of protest telegrams and letters were sent to Japan from all over the world, forming a massive wave of protests.
    At the same time, the twenty Japanese patriotic workers who were imprisoned have always persisted in their struggle. Although death constantly threatened them, and the inhuman suffering in prison has long tormented them, and several people, including Saitō Sen and Takeda Hisashi, have become seriously ill because of this, they have never surrendered to the reactionary forces. In the year from the announcement of the fascist verdict by the Fukushima District Court to the forced acceptance of the appeal by the Sendai High Court, they broke through numerous difficulties and sent out 50,000 letters of accusation, exposing the fascist conspiracy and atrocities of the American and Japanese reactionaries to the people of the world.
    Under such circumstances, the Sendai High Court in Japan was finally forced to accept the appeal of all defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," and began the second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident" case on October 23, 1951, and announced an investigation of the facts for retrial at the 18th public trial. In the 110 trials of the second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident" case in the Sendai High Court, the American and Japanese reactionaries still could not produce the slightest evidence to constitute the crime of the defendants, and many witnesses and material evidence repeatedly confirmed the innocence of the twenty workers and the absurdity of the verdict of the Fukushima District Court.
    However, the executioner is unwilling to easily lay down the butcher knife. The American and Japanese reactionaries, who are openly conducting the so-called negotiations on the US-Japan "Mutual Security Assistance Agreement" and preparing to expand Japan's military equipment on a large scale, have not yet abandoned their conspiracy to kill the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." At the 85th trial on April 28 and the last trial on July 23 of the second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident" case, the Japanese reactionary prosecution authorities barbarously demanded that the Sendai High Court uphold the absurd verdict of the Fukushima District Court, which framed the twenty innocent workers.
    Now, the Sendai High Court in Japan is about to announce the verdict of the second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident" case on November 5, and the Japanese people, under the call of the Japan National Relief Association, are launching a nationwide struggle in September and October as the "Relief Month" for rescuing the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." The Japanese people know that rescuing the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" is not only to rescue the lives and freedom of the twenty young patriotic workers, but also to uphold justice and defend peace. As the editorial of the Japanese "Akahata" newspaper pointed out on July 12, this is a struggle to smash the fascist war policy of the American and Japanese reactionaries.
    All honest people resolutely oppose the American and Japanese reactionaries' shameful murder of Japanese patriotic workers under the guise of "law," and oppose the re-enactment of the American "Rosenberg Incident" in Japan. The Chinese people, along with the broad masses of the people around the world, are closely concerned about the development of the "Matsukawa Incident" and continue to support the just struggle of the twenty persecuted Japanese patriotic workers.

    援救日本“松川事件”的爱国工人
    徐明
    美日反动派在一九四九年八月间制造松川火车出轨事件，把二十名无辜的日本爱国工人非法关进冤狱，已经四年多了。
    无数事实证明，“松川事件”是美日反动派有计划地制造出来迫害日本共产党人和爱国工人、打击日本和平民主运动的政治阴谋。人们知道，日本军国主义投降后，日本人民的力量随着世界人民力量的强大而日益增长起来。一九四九年一月日本众议院大选时，日本工人阶级和日本人民的先锋队——日本共产党获得了三百万张选票，得到了众议院三十五个席位。日本广大人民的觉悟程度迅速提高，对美日反动派变日本为美国殖民地和军事基地的罪恶勾当，进行着坚决的斗争。美日反动派惧怕日本人民力量的发展，在一九四九年五月间制订了强迫限定政府机构及国营企业职工名额的所谓“定员法”，大规模解雇工人，仅国营铁道公司系统被解雇的工人即达九万五千人之多。美日反动派企图利用这个反动法案一举“清洗”政府机构及国营企业中的日本共产党人和进步工会积极分子。当时，日本工人在日本共产党领导下，以“国铁”（国营铁道公司）工人为中心展开了全国规模的反对解雇的斗争。吉田政府在美国主子的授意下，于同年七月五日及七月十五日“国铁”第一批和第二批宣布大量裁员名单的同时，曾先后制造了“下山事件”和“三鹰事件”，企图诬陷日本共产党，但都遭到了可耻的失败。于是，美日反动派就又制造了事先经过周密策划的“松川事件”。
    一九四九年八月十七日上午三时，日本国有铁路本线上开往东京的第四一二号上行列车，在福岛县的金谷川站和松川站之间出轨翻车，司机和助手三人死亡。第二天，在东京的吉田政府内阁官房长官增田甲子七便发表了一个声明，诬指这是日本共产党人的“暴行”。接着，美日反动派就在事件发生后的一个多月间，先后逮捕了当时站在反对解雇斗争、反对美国资本侵入“国铁”和“东芝”（东京芝浦电气公司）斗争最前列的“国铁”工会福岛支部和“东芝”松川工会主要负责人铃木信、佐藤一等二十名日本共产党人和爱国工人。不久，日本福岛地方检察厅竟用捏造出来的所谓“共谋覆车杀人”的“罪状”向福岛地方法院起诉。“松川事件”二十名无辜被告在福岛地方法院九十四次审讯中进行的法庭斗争，揭穿了反动检察当局的一切无耻谎言。福岛地方法院拿不出任何足以证实无辜被告们犯罪的确实证据来，把这个案件拖延了一年多。到一九五○年，美国在朝鲜发动侵略战争，美日反动派为进一步镇压日本的和平民主力量，便用莫须有的罪名“整肃”日共中央委员，封闭“赤旗报”，并指使福岛地方法院在十二月六日毫无事实根据地判处“松川事件”二十名无辜工人以死刑（五名）、无期徒刑（五名）和刑期很长的有期徒刑。
    人所共见，日本福岛地方法院的这个判决荒谬无理到了极点。例如：“判决书”说，高桥晴雄等五名被告在一九四九年八月十六日夜由福岛市去到距离二十多里外的出事地点，用螺丝钳子在二、三十分钟的时间中拔除了铁轨道钉，并于当夜赶回福岛市。但是，不仅和被告同居一室的家属和被告的同事等许多的人证证明这五人当夜确实在家，而且其中高桥晴雄过去因公重伤，腰骨数处跌断，迄今还是一个没有完全痊愈的残疾者，根本不可能在夜间短短的几个钟点中长途疾行五十余里。过去为高桥治过病的新澙和福岛两个医院曾写有证件，证实他不能长途疾行。可是福岛地方法院却非法地把它们隐藏起来。美日反动派使用野蛮手段诬害无辜的阴谋，难道不是昭然若揭吗？
    美日反动派蓄意制造“松川事件”谋杀日本爱国工人的罪行，激怒了日本一切有良心的人们。当无辜被告们从监牢中把“松川事件”真相揭露出来后，日本人民展开了越来越广泛的支援他们的斗争。据今年五月统计，日本国内签名要求释放“松川事件”无辜被告的人已达六百万以上。许多法律工作者自动起来为“松川事件”无辜被告辩护，组成了日本史所未见的一百七十多人的律师团。许多科学家、文化工作者多次组织了代表团，对“松川事件”进行了调查，并向广大人民作了报告，从而使“松川事件”的真相更加大白于天下。
    美日反动派制造“松川事件”谋杀日本爱国工人的罪行也激起了世界各国工人阶级和一切正义人士的愤慨。在福岛地方法院宣布判决后不久，世界工会联合会、世界工联亚澳联络局等国际工人团体，代表着全世界千百万工人的意志，先后向日本吉田政府提出严重抗议，要求释放“松川事件”全体无辜被告，并致函慰问二十位被迫害的日本爱国工人。中国、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、越南、印度、法国等许多国家的工会组织、人民团体和广大人民，一致坚决抗议美日反动派的法西斯暴行，并热烈支援“松川事件”全体无辜被告的正义斗争。成千成万封的抗议电文和信件，从世界各地寄到了日本，形成了规模巨大的抗议浪潮。
    同时，系身冤狱的二十位日本爱国工人始终坚持着斗争，虽然死亡时时威胁着他们，监牢中非人的苦难长期折磨着他们，斋藤千、武田久等几个人都因此得了重病，然而他们一直没有向反动势力屈服。在福岛地方法院宣布法西斯判决至仙台高等裁判所被迫接受上诉的这一年中，他们冲破重重困难发出了五万封控诉信件，把美日反动派的法西斯阴谋和暴行在全世界人民面前揭发出来了。
    在这样的情况下，日本仙台高等裁判所终于被迫接受了“松川事件”全体被告的上诉，从一九五一年十月二十三日开始了“松川事件”案第二审的公审，并且在第十八次公审法庭上，宣布调查事实重审。在仙台高等裁判所“松川事件”案第二审的一百一十次审讯中，美日反动派依然提不出一丝一毫足以构成被告犯罪的证据来，而许许多多的人证物证却一再证实了二十位工人的无辜和福岛地方法院判决的荒谬。
    然而，刽子手是不肯轻易放下屠刀的。正在公开进行所谓美日“共同安全援助协定”的谈判、准备大规模扩充日本军备的美日反动派，迄今仍然没有放弃杀害“松川事件”无辜被告的阴谋。在今年四月二十八日第八十五次和七月二十三日最后一次
    “松川事件”案第二审的法庭上，日本反动检察当局竟然野蛮地要求仙台高等裁判所维持福岛地方法院诬害二十位无辜工人的荒谬判决。
    现在，日本仙台高等裁判所即将于十一月五日宣布“松川事件”案第二审的判决，日本人民正在日本国民救援会的号召下，以九、十两个月为援救“松川事件”无辜被告的“救援月”，展开了全国规模的斗争。日本人民知道，援救“松川事件”无辜被告，不仅是为了援救二十位青年爱国工人的生命与自由，同时也是为了伸张正义和保卫和平。正如七月十二日日本“赤旗报”社论所指出的，这是为了粉碎美日反动派法西斯战争政策的斗争。
    一切正直的人们都坚决反对美日反动派在“法律”外衣下对日本爱国工人进行可耻的谋杀，反对美国“罗森堡事件”在日本重演。中国人民正和全世界广大人民一道，密切关心着“松川事件”的发展，并继续支援被迫害的二十位日本爱国工人的正义斗争。
