Soviet Experts Help Us Build Seamless Steel Tube Plant
Gratitude to Soviet Experts for Their Patient Assistance
Spoken by Zhong Zhenqing, Worker of Anshan Iron and Steel Works Mechanical Installation Engineering Company
Recorded by Yang Shaokui, Anshan City Labor Model

Last January, after graduating from the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' large-scale, seamless technology training class, I went to the site and was shocked! All the machines were brand new, various types, and I couldn't even name one of them. Not to mention using them, I hadn't even seen them before. Looking at these machines, I wondered how to install these new machines!

The installation project of the seamless steel tube plant began. When the crane and hammer sounded, it dispelled my worries. The people sent by Stalin – Soviet experts – not only came to instruct us but also personally helped us install these machines.

In the summer, the sun was like a ball of fire, shining into the factory building at an angle, and the heat was simply suffocating. Soviet expert Klibachov was nervously checking the level, beads of sweat falling on the ground one after another. Initially, when installing the lifting platform, we used iron wedges to hammer the machine base. Just as we were getting into the swing of it, the expert saw it and quickly ran over, telling us to use a "hydraulic press" to lift it. He said, "Using iron wedges is slow and doesn't guarantee quality!" We listened and immediately followed the expert's advice, and sure enough, the quality was good, and we completed the task three days ahead of schedule. In October, when installing the cooling table, four experts happened to come on the day we were about to install it. The bearing expert asked us to open the bearing cap, and the expert saw: the bearing clearance was too small, and the ball bearings had run to one side! The expert said, "Installing it like this will ruin the quality. There was a lack of inspection beforehand!" Everyone quickly opened the bearing caps of the other bearings and saw that 70% were wrong. Everyone said, "Luckily, the expert was careful, otherwise we would have had to rework everything!" In the winter, we installed the coupling wheel of the main drive shaft of the cooling table. The coupling wheel was installed, but it was not aligned with the center line, and the chain wheels were one in front of the other. Later, design expert Comrade He Lanmucao Fu saw it and immediately made a suggestion; he immediately personally worked with us to install it. The weather was very cold, and Comrade He Lanmucao Fu's hands and face were red and swollen, but he still worked as tirelessly as us. We advised him not to operate it himself, but he wouldn't listen.

Thanks to the patient guidance and assistance of Soviet experts, no quality accidents occurred in the projects I participated in installing, such as lifting platforms, tipping machines, fixing devices, cooling tables, and automation equipment. In the future, I will definitely strengthen my efforts in all aspects, mobilize all the workers in the team, and use practical actions to thank the Soviet experts for their selfless assistance to us.

Experts Taught a Lot, I Must Study Hard
Zeng Xianqin, Deputy Captain and Technician of the Fifth Team of Anshan Iron and Steel Works Mechanical Installation Engineering Company

I am a fitter with twenty-six years of experience and only two years of primary school education. Due to my low level of education and technical conservatism, before liberation, although I had installed some machines and done other fitter work, I always followed old rules, knowing what to do but not why, and I didn't understand any technical theory at all. After liberation, thanks to the education and cultivation of the Party, my cultural and technical level gradually improved, but what I learned always couldn't keep up with the actual needs. In April 1952, the organization transferred me to work at the seamless steel tube plant. I was very happy when I first came. But after a month or two, I encountered the following difficulties: Because what I had learned in the past was the backward technology and old operating methods of the Japanese imperialist rule, coupled with my ideological conservatism and concern for face, I didn't ask Soviet experts for advice, so I was too slow to accept the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. The preparation work before each project construction, the experts had perfect suggestions in advance, but we did very poorly. In cleaning and pre-assembly, the experts had very high requirements for technical safety, environmental hygiene, and equipment maintenance, but we did not do well. Later, the formal installation work began, and the experts moved to the seamless steel tube plant to work, and we met every day. At this time, under the urging and education of the Party, my thinking was completely changed, and if I didn't do a good job, I would ask the experts in time, ask the experts to criticize and help, and the experts often said to me: "Comrade, don't be afraid of not knowing how to work, just be afraid of not learning with an open mind." Sometimes, because of small problems, I didn't ask the experts beforehand, and I didn't do a good job. The experts would ask why I didn't ask beforehand? I replied that it was because the experts were very busy, and I was embarrassed to bother the experts with small problems, and the experts would shake my hand hard and say: "Comrade, you are wrong, I am never afraid of trouble, as long as you are willing to learn, I can teach you all my thirty years of experience, to build more factories for China and teach more people." I was moved to tears. From this time on, I further learned from the loyal, serious, and selfless experts. In the past year or so, I have learned new installation methods and mastered new operating procedures in technology. In terms of labor attitude and political thought, due to the great internationalist spirit and selfless labor of the Soviet experts, I have basically overcome my past bureaucratism and officialism, and I can go deep into the site every day, carefully and responsibly check the work, and find problems and solve them anytime and anywhere. But the experts have taught a lot in the past year or so, and I have learned very little, and I have not met the requirements of the Party and the people for me. In the future, I will definitely make up my mind to learn from the experts on the existing basis. Use practical actions to guarantee 100% implementation of the expert's recommendations, and repay the Party and the dear experts for their cultivation, education, and requirements, and guarantee the completion of the glorious construction tasks assigned to me by the state and the people.

What I Learned in the Installation Work
Gao Zupei, Technician of the Fifth Team of Anshan Iron and Steel Works Mechanical Installation Engineering Company

In the year and a half of participating in the installation work of the seamless steel tube plant, I deeply realized that this factory is a great university.

As soon as I arrived at Anshan Iron and Steel Works, I participated in the ore dressing and sintering projects, and after doing it for a year and a half, I realized that machine installation depends on the center line, the center line comes from the foundation, and the machine must be level. Although three years have passed, I didn't know exactly where to find it and what level to achieve.

It's completely different after I participated in the construction of the seamless steel tube plant. During the three months of pre-assembly work, Soviet expert Klibachov taught us hand in hand. He taught us how to use a level to determine the benchmark point to find the elevation, and taught us a set of methods for finding the center line and ensuring assembly quality. In this way, we were able to undertake the work of installing the pipe rolling mill, sizing machine, sizing machine, and reducing machine. This work is quite complicated, and the base of one machine alone weighs 70 tons, requiring installation with zero error. After the test run, it proved that according to the guidance of the Soviet experts, our installation was in accordance with the specifications. During this test run, I also learned how to adjust the machinery and clean the assembly. On this basis, according to the Soviet data, I have been able to master the mechanical adjustment work of the front workbench of the pipe rolling mill.

What should an installation technician do? I clearly recognized this issue in the construction of the seamless steel tube plant. We should study the drawings in detail, and work with the worker comrades to find ways to ensure that the project meets the quality standards, and help the workers to construct according to the operating procedures. But in the past, I thought that looking at the drawings in the room for a while meant not going deep into the site, so I ran around all day long, doing everything myself, without carefully looking at the drawings, and went to the site; when the workers had problems, they couldn't solve them either. After the project went wrong, I realized that it was not constructed according to the drawings. When dressing ore, the ball mill was almost installed before I realized that the bearings were made of Babbitt metal, and the water distributor of the magnetic separator had been installed for a year before I found out that it shouldn't be iron, it should be copper. This caused a lot of losses to the state. Now, with the help of Soviet experts, these losses have been avoided. The bearing clearances we adjusted did not cause the copper tiles to heat up during the test run.

Looking back on my year and a half of work at the seamless steel tube plant, I have made a lot of progress, and I deeply feel that this is inseparable from the help of Soviet experts.

In order to respond to the care of the people of the motherland and Chairman Mao, and to respond to the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, I am determined to dedicate everything to the construction of the motherland, constantly improve my skills, and build our great motherland.

We Must Learn More Humbly from Experts
Cao Yongzhi, Captain of the Installation Engineering Third Team of Anshan Iron and Steel Works Metal Structure Engineering Company

In June 1952, the superiors assigned me to the seamless steel tube plant construction site to be responsible for the work of the Installation Engineering Third Team.

When installing the screw fixing frame project, the initial design was a small fixing frame, and large angle steel was not used as a pillar. Most of the fixing frame was supported on the wooden pillars of the cement box outside, so the screws were also crooked as the wooden box moved, and repeated rework and correction of the screws caused a lot of waste. The worker comrades in charge of civil construction complained that we were installing the screws slowly, and we complained that they moved the wooden boxes. At this time, the Soviet expert told us a parallel operation method, where those who tied steel bars, those who installed cable pipes, and those who erected cement box planks, each did their own work without affecting each other. This parallel operation was both fast and avoided rework. Accepting this experience, we adopted the method of assigning a special person to be responsible for it, and trained a group of thirty-two workers to specialize in installing fixing frames. On the one hand, we cultivated their special technical skills, and on the other hand, we learned about the fixing frame drawings. After a period of training, most of the workers became skilled technicians in installing fixing frames, mastering the advanced technology of screw spacing with an error of no more than one millimeter. More than ninety fixing frames were all completed ahead of schedule.

This is just one example of the many help the expert gave me. From this example, it can be seen that the reason why our various tasks can be completed ahead of schedule, and the reason why our technology can be rapidly improved, is inseparable from the patient assistance of Soviet experts. In the new tasks in the future, we must learn more humbly from Soviet experts.

    苏联专家帮助我们建设了无缝钢管厂
    感谢苏联专家耐心的帮助
    鞍钢机械安装工程公司工人  钟振庆讲
    鞍山市劳动模范  杨少魁记
    去年一月，我参加鞍钢大型、无缝技术训练班学习毕业后，到现场一看，吓！机器全是崭新的，各种各样，我一件也叫不上名字来。不说没用过，连看也没看见过。看着这些机器，我想怎么安装这些新机器呀！
    无缝钢管厂安装工程开始了。当吊车锤子一响的时候，打破了我的顾虑。斯大林派来的人——苏联专家，不光前来指教我们，还亲自帮助我们动手安装这些机器。
    夏天，日头像团火，斜射进厂房里，那股热劲简直闷死人。苏联专家克里巴乔夫紧张地在看水平，头上汗珠子一颗接一颗地落在地上。起初安装升降台时，我们用斜铁打机器座子。正打在劲头上，专家看见了赶紧跑过来，叫用“油压机”顶。他说：“用斜铁打，进度慢，又保不住质量！”我们一听，立刻按照专家的建议去干，果然质量好，又提前三天完成了任务。十月份安装冷却台，在我们就要安装的那天，恰巧来了四位专家。轴承专家叫我们把轴承瓦盖揭开，专家一看：轴承间隙小了，滚珠跑到一面去了！专家说：“这样就安装，质量就糟了。事前缺乏检查！”大家连忙把别的轴承瓦盖也揭开一看，百分之七十都不对。大伙都说：“幸亏专家细心，若不，咱们都得返工！”冬天，我们安装冷却台主动轴的接手对轮。接手对轮是安装上了，可就都不对中心线，链子轮前一个后一个的。后来设计专家何蓝木曹夫同志一看，立刻提出了建议；他马上亲自动手和我们一块安装。天气非常冷，何蓝木曹夫同志的手和脸都冻红肿了，但他仍然和我们一样不停地工作着。我们劝他不要亲自操作，可是说啥也不行。
    由于苏联专家的耐心指导和帮助，我参加安装的升降台、翻料机、固定装置、冷却台、自动化设备等工程，一件质量事故也没有发生。今后，我一定在各方面加强努力，把全班工人带动起来，以实际行动来感谢苏联专家对我们的大公无私的帮助。
    专家教的很多，我要努力学习
    鞍钢机械安装工程公司第五队副队长兼技术员  曾宪钦
    我是一个有二十六年工龄的钳工，念过二年小学。由于文化程度低，以及技术保守，解放前，虽然也安装过几部机器和干过其他钳工活，但都是沿守旧规，知其然不知所以然，对技术理论根本不懂。解放后，由于党的教育培养，我的文化和技术水平都逐渐提高了，但所学的总是赶不上实际需要。一九五二年四月组织上把我调到无缝钢管厂工作。刚来时我很高兴。但一两个月后，我遇到以下的困难：由于我过去所学所会的都是日本帝国主义统治时代的落后技术和旧的操作方法，加上思想上保守、爱面子，不向苏联专家请教，因此，对苏联的先进经验接受太慢。每项工程施工前的准备工作，专家在事先有完善的建议，但我们作的很差。在清洗预装中，对技术安全、环境卫生、设备保养等，专家的要求很高，我们作得不好。以后，正式安装工作开始，专家迁到无缝钢管厂办公，每天都见面，这时我在党的督促教育下，思想上才彻底改变过来，工作作得不好，及时问专家，要求专家批评、帮助，专家时常对我讲：“同志，工作不怕不会，就怕不虚心学习。”有时因为小的问题事先没问专家，作得不好，专家就问为什么事先不问呢？我回答是因为专家很忙，小的问题不好意思麻烦专家，而专家这时使劲握住我的手说：“同志，你体会错了，我绝不怕麻烦，你只要肯学习，我可以把三十年的经验都教给你，为中国建设更多的工厂，教会更多的人。”我感激得流下泪来。从这时起，我更进一步地向忠诚严肃而又亲切无私的专家学习。一年多来，在技术上我学会了新的安装方法，掌握了新的操作规程。在劳动态度与政治思想上，由于苏联专家的伟大国际主义精神和忘我的劳动，使我基本上克服了过去的事务主义与官僚主义作风，每日都能深入现场，认真负责地检查工作，随时随地发现问题解决问题。但一年多来专家所教的很多，我所学会的很少，并没有满足党和人民对我的要求，我今后一定下决心在现有基础上，努力向专家学习。用实际行动保证百分之百的贯彻专家建议，报答党与亲爱的专家对我的培养教育和要求，保证完成国家和人民所交给我的光荣建设任务。
    我在安装工作中学到了什么
    鞍钢机械安装工程公司第五队技术员  高祖培
    在参加无缝钢管厂一年半的安装工作当中，我深深体会到：这座工厂是一座大学校。
    我一到鞍钢就参加了选矿和烧结工程，做了一年半以后才知道：机器安装要靠中心线，中心线是从地基上来的，机械要有水平。虽然时间已过去了三年，可是，具体的应该从什么地方找呢？要达到什么程度呢？就完全不知道了。
    我参加无缝钢管厂的建设工作以后就完全不一样了。在三个月预装配工作中，苏联专家克里巴乔夫把着手教会了我们。教我们使用水平仪定基准点找标高的方法，教我们找中心线和保证装配质量等一套办法。这样，我们才能担负起安装轧管机、整径机和定径机和减径机的工作。这个工作是相当复杂的，光一台机器的底座就有七十吨重，要求安装得一点不差。经过试车，证明按照苏联专家的指导，我们安装的是合乎规格的。这次试车中，我又学会了调整机械、清洗装配等。在这样的基础上，按照苏联的资料我已经能掌握轧管机前工作台的机械调整工作了。
    做一个安装技术员应该做些什么呢？在建设无缝钢管厂当中我明确认识了这个问题。应该详细研究图纸，和工人同志们一起设法使工程达到质量标准，帮助工人按照操作规程施工。可是从前我认为在屋里看一会图纸，便是不深入现场，于是一天东跑西颠，大小工作都由自己动手，不仔细看图纸，就到现场去；工人有了问题，也解决不了。工程出了毛病以后，一看才知道是没有按照图纸施工。在选矿时，球磨机都快安好了，才知道轴承是乌金的，磁选机的水流子安好一年了，以后发现不该是铁的，应该是铜的。这使国家受到不少损失。现在得到苏联专家的帮助，避免了这些损失。我们调整的轴承间隙，在试车时就没有发生铜瓦发热的事。
    回顾我在无缝钢管厂一年半的工作，自己进步了不少，我深深体会到这和苏联专家的帮助是分不开的。
    为了回答祖国人民和毛主席的关怀，回答苏联无私的帮助，我决心将一切献给祖国建设，不断提高自己的技术，建设我们伟大的祖国。
    我们要更虚心地向专家学习
    鞍钢金属结构工程公司安装工程三队队长  曹永治
    一九五二年六月，上级分配我到无缝钢管厂工地去负责安装工程三队的工作。
    在安装螺丝固定架工程的时候，最初设计的是小固定架，没有用大角钢作柱子，固定架大部分是支在外面水泥盒子的木柱子上，因此木盒一动螺丝跟着也就歪了，数次返工校正螺丝造成了不少的浪费。负责土木建筑施工的工人同志怨我们安装螺丝慢，我们怨他们动了木盒子。这时候苏联专家就告诉我们一种平行作业的操作方法，绑钢筋的、安电缆管的、立水泥盒木板的，各做各的谁也不影响谁。这种平行作业既快而又不会返工。接受这个经验，我们采用专人负责的方法，培养一个小组三十二名工人专门安装固定架，一方面培养他们这种专长的特殊技术，另一方面学习着固定架图纸，经过一个时期的锻炼以后，大部分工人都变成了安装固定架的熟练技工，掌握了螺丝距离一个粍都不差的先进技术，九十多台固定架，台台都是提前完成的。
    这只是专家给予我的许多帮助中的一个例子。从这一个例子中可以看出，我们的各项任务所以都能提前完成，我们的技术所以能迅速提高，都是与苏联专家的耐心帮助分不开的。今后在新的任务中，我们要更虚心地向苏联专家学习。
