The explanation work for non-directly repatriated prisoners of war, as stipulated in the Korean Armistice Agreement, has just begun, and it has been met with increasingly blatant obstruction and sabotage by U.S. special agents. This criminal behavior by U.S. special agents is a clear attempt by the U.S. to forcibly deprive our captured personnel of their right to demand repatriation and a peaceful life back home, in order to achieve its consistently despicable goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

According to the Armistice Agreement, the explanation work for non-directly repatriated prisoners of war should have started on September 26th; however, the U.S. side unreasonably delayed providing the equipment for the explanation and used various pretexts to obstruct the start of the explanation work. Under our resolute opposition, the repeated urging of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and the severe condemnation of world public opinion, the U.S. side was forced to stop its "delaying tactics" of refusing to provide explanation equipment. But the U.S. was not satisfied with delaying the explanation work by twenty days, and immediately put into practice a complete set of evil plans that had been prepared long ago to sabotage our explanation work. Before our explanation work began on October 15th, the American "International News Service" leaked the U.S.'s pre-planned three steps: first, use the Lee-Chiang special agents planted by the U.S. in the prisoners of war to "obstruct the explanation work"; second, use U.S. observers to interfere with and oppose our explanation work, "to delay the explanation work"; third, use the American running dog Syngman Rhee to "release the prisoners of war" by force.

The situation in the first two days after the explanation work began proved that the U.S. was implementing its heinous conspiracy according to this predetermined plan. On the 15th, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission arranged for the first batch of 1,000 of our captured personnel to attend the first explanation, but due to the obstruction of U.S., Lee, and Chiang special agents mixed in with the prisoners of war, 500 of them were unable to attend the explanation at all, and the explanation work for the remaining 500 was delayed by seven hours before it could begin. On the 16th, the special agents became even more reckless. They openly held weapons and surrounded the tents in the camp, and entrenched themselves in trenches, locking the prisoners of war in the tents to prevent them from coming out to listen to the explanation, so that all the explanation work on this day failed to proceed according to the planned schedule. Not only that, but the special agents also brutally implemented methods of threatening and controlling the prisoners of war. They threatened the prisoners of war with death to prevent them from accepting the explanation or requesting repatriation. They forced the prisoners of war to monitor each other through the "joint guarantee" method. They even plugged the prisoners of war's ears so that they could not hear the explanation, and claimed that they would rush into the camps of those who had applied for repatriation, snatch back the prisoners of war and execute them. In the explanation tents, the special agents, encouraged by U.S. observers, dared to openly take actions that violated the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits."

The reason why these special agents are so bold and reckless is entirely the result of the U.S.'s arrangement, encouragement, and support. Everyone knows that many special agents were directly sent by the U.S. to the prisoner-of-war camps. We have identified the names of some special agents (including 464 special agents) and submitted them to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. This group of people still pretend to be prisoners of war and act like overlords among the prisoners of war. On the one hand, the U.S. continuously arranged methods for the special agents to sabotage the explanation work and guaranteed to support them through the "hospitals" they provided to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, through their staff in the prisoner-of-war camps, and through their radio stations and liaison stations set up in the mountains near the prisoner-of-war camps; on the other hand, the U.S. maintained the special agent organizational system in the prisoner-of-war camps as it was, threatened the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and repeatedly interfered with the measures taken by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to perform its duties. The spokesmen and news agencies of the U.S. also constantly and publicly incited prisoners of war to riot, and even threatened to take "bloody actions" against the neutral personnel and our explanation personnel. It is precisely because of this open support from the U.S. that the special agents dare to take a contemptuous attitude towards the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the "Terms of Reference." The "Terms of Reference" stipulates that "no violence or indignity to person or honor or self-respect shall be permitted in any manner or for any purpose whatsoever;" the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits" stipulates that "no prisoner of war shall inflict violence on other prisoners of war;" "no prisoner of war shall take any action detrimental to or interfering with the right of this Commission to perform its lawful functions and responsibilities;" "no prisoner of war shall take any action obstructing the explanation and visit work." However, the special agents dared to obstruct prisoners of war from accepting the explanation and requesting repatriation by violent actions such as digging out hearts and disemboweling, "joint guarantee," and stuffing cotton in the ears of prisoners of war; dared to openly coerce prisoners of war to resist and sabotage the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's arrangement for prisoners of war to listen to the explanation; and openly obstructed the explanation work by force. The responsibility for these sabotage activities should be entirely borne by the U.S., which dispatched, arranged, and encouraged these special agents.

The other step of the U.S.'s plan to sabotage the explanation work revealed by the American "International News Service"—the method of having American "observers" come forward to sabotage the explanation work—also appeared on the first day of the explanation work. The so-called "observer representatives" and Kuomintang special agents wearing U.S. military uniforms sent by the U.S. to the explanation tents openly and repeatedly interrupted the explanation of our explanation representatives, and even did not listen to the restraint of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission personnel, in order to obstruct the progress of the explanation work. Moreover, they openly threatened the prisoners of war in front of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission personnel and our personnel, saying: "I will show you the way, go to Taiwan through this door." These facts show that the clauses in the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits" stipulating that "at the time of explanation and visits, the observer representatives of neither side shall interfere with the explanation work at any time" and "prohibit any action infringing on the rights enjoyed by prisoners of war under the terms of reference of this Commission" have been seriously violated by the U.S.

Under the circumstances of such planned sabotage by the U.S., our explanation work to the prisoners of war was obstructed and interrupted on the second day after it began. It is very clear that the U.S.'s sabotage plan will continue to be implemented with even greater intensity. This puts the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" in danger of being completely destroyed. Li Xiangchao, Chief Member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, has lodged the most serious protest against the illegal acts of the U.S. in seriously sabotaging the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" with the aim of forcibly detaining our captured personnel, and demanded the U.S.: "Your side must immediately stop all actions that sabotage the custody and explanation and forcibly obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war. You must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from these actions." This protest and demand are completely justified. In order to stop the U.S.'s illegal acts, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has the right to take effective measures to perform its just duties entrusted to it by the Armistice Agreement. The arrangement stipulated in Article 8 of the "Terms of Reference" that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should provide freedom and convenience for the countries to which the prisoners of war belong to carry out explanation work is an important duty and right of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and the U.S. and Lee-Chiang special agents have no right to sabotage this right of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Article 7 of the "Terms of Reference" also stipulates: "...Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as diminishing the power of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to exercise its lawful functions and responsibilities to control prisoners of war under its temporary jurisdiction." All people in the world who are concerned about the Korean Armistice, and concerned about peace in the Far East and the world, will support the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in fulfilling its duties and rights, effectively controlling the prisoners of war, so that all of them will not be persecuted by the U.S. and Lee-Chiang special agents, and exercise their right to be repatriated and return home to live a peaceful life.

    制止美方破坏解释工作的行为
    白　云
    朝鲜停战协定所规定的对不直接遣返战俘的解释工作刚刚开始，就遭到美方特务越来越明目张胆的阻挠和破坏。美方特务这种罪恶行为，显然是美方企图用暴力剥夺我方被俘人员要求遣返回家过和平生活的权利，达到它一贯强迫扣留战俘的卑鄙目的。
    根据停战协定，对不直接遣返战俘的解释工作，本应在九月二十六日开始的；可是美方横蛮无理地延迟提供进行解释的设备，并以其他种种藉口阻挠解释工作的开始。在我方的坚决反对、中立国遣返委员会的再三督促和世界舆论的严厉谴责之下，美方才被迫中止了它拒不提供解释设备的“拖延战术”。但美方并不以迟延了二十天的解释工作日期为满足，他们立刻就把早已准备好的一整套破坏我方解释工作的罪恶计划拿出来实行了。十月十五日我方进行解释工作开始前，美国“国际新闻社”就泄露了美方预定的三个步骤：一、通过美方布置在战俘中的李蒋特务来“阻碍解释工作”；二、通过美方观察员对我方解释工作横加干涉和反对，“使解释工作拖延下来”，三、通过美国走狗李承晚以武力“释放战俘”。
    解释工作开始后头两天的情况证明，美方正是按这种预定步骤实施其万恶阴谋的。十五日中立国遣返委员会安排了第一批我方被俘人员一千名听取首次解释，但是由于混在战俘中的美、李、蒋特务的阻挠，其中五百人根本未能出席接受解释，其余五百人的解释工作也迟延了七小时才得以开始。十六日，特务们更为横行无忌了。他们公然手持凶器围住看管营场中的帐篷，并且掘壕据守，把战俘关在帐篷中阻止他们出来听取解释，使这一天的解释工作全部未能按预定计划进行。不仅如此，特务们还凶残绝顶地实行了威胁和控制战俘的办法。他们以死来威胁战俘使其不敢接受解释或要求遣返。他们以“连保”办法强迫战俘互相监视。他们甚至把战俘的耳朵塞起来使其听不到解释，并且声言要冲入已申请遣返的营场中劫回战俘加以处死。在解释帐篷中，特务们在美方观察人员的鼓励下也敢于公然采取破坏“解释和访问工作细则”的行动。
    这些特务之如此胆大妄为，完全是美方布置、鼓励和支持的结果。大家知道，许多特务是美方直接派到战俘营中去的。我方已查明部分特务的名单
    （包括四百六十四名特务）提交中立国遣返委员会，这批人至今还假冒战俘身分在战俘中称王称霸。美方一方面通过他们提供给中立国遣返委员会的“医院”、通过他们在战俘营中的工作人员、通过他们设在战俘营附近山上的广播站和联络站等等，不断地向特务们布置破坏解释工作的办法并保证给他们撑腰；另一方面，美方又原封不动地保持了战俘中的特务组织系统，威胁中立国遣返委员会，并且再三干涉中立国遣返委员会执行职务所采取的措施。美方的发言人和新闻机构，还不断地公开鼓动战俘举行暴乱，甚至威胁着要对中立国人员和我方解释人员采取“流血行动”。正是由于美方这种公开的支持，特务们才敢于对中立国遣返委员会和“职权范围”采取蔑视的态度。“职权范围”中规定：“不得允许以任何方式或为任何目的，对战俘人身施以暴力或侮辱其尊严或自尊”；“解释和访问工作细则”中规定：“任何战俘不得对其他战俘施以暴力”；“禁止战俘任何有损于或妨碍本委员会执行其合法职务与责任的权利之行动”；“禁止战俘任何阻碍解释与访问工作的行为”。可是特务们竟敢以挖心剖腹、“连保”和在战俘耳朵中塞棉花等等暴力行动阻碍战俘接受解释和要求遣返；竟敢公然胁迫战俘抗拒和破坏中立国遣返委员会安排战俘听取解释的权利和公开以武力阻挠解释工作。这些破坏活动的责任，是完全应该由派遣、布置和鼓励这些特务的美方负担的。
    美国“国际新闻社”所透露的美方破坏解释工作的另一个步骤——由美国“观察员”出面来破坏解释工作的方法，也在解释工作开始的第一天就出现了。美方派到解释帐篷中去的所谓“观察代表”和穿着美军制服的国民党特务，公然一再打断我方解释代表的解释，甚至不听中立国遣返委会员人员的制止，以阻挠解释工作的进行。而且他们当着中立国遣返委员会人员和我方人员的面前公开威胁战俘说：“我给你指路，到台湾去走这个门”。这些事实说明，“解释和访问工作细则”中规定的“在解释与访问时，不许任何一方的观察代表在任何时候干涉解释工作”以及“禁止任何侵犯战俘根据本委员会职权范围而享有的权利之行动”等条款，已经遭受了美方严重的破坏。
    在美方这样有计划地进行破坏活动的情况下，我方对战俘的解释工作在开始后的第二天就被阻挠中断了。很显然，美方的破坏计划还会变本加厉地继续实行下去。这就使“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”有被彻底破坏的危险。军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将已就美方严重破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”、旨在强迫扣留我方被俘人员的非法行为提出了最严重的抗议，并向美方提出：“你方必须立即停止破坏看管与解释、以强力阻挠战俘遣返的各种行动。由于这些行动所产生的一切后果，必须由你方完全负担。”这种抗议和要求是完全正当的。为了制止美方的不法行为，中立国遣返委员会有权采取有效措施，以执行停战协定所赋予它的公正职责。“职权范围”第八款所规定的中立国遣返委员会进行安排使战俘所属国家有自由与便利进行解释工作，是中立国遣返委员会的重要职责和权利，美方和李蒋特务没有任何权利来破坏中立国遣返委员会这种权利。“职权范围”第七款又规定：“……本协定中没有任何项目应被解释为削弱中立国遣返委员会行使其合法职务和责任以控制在其临时管辖下之战俘的权力。”全世界关心朝鲜停战、关心远东与世界和平的人们，都将支持中立国遣返委员会履行它的职责和权利，有效地控制战俘，使他们全部不受美方和李蒋特务的迫害，行使他们被遣返权利回家过和平生活。
