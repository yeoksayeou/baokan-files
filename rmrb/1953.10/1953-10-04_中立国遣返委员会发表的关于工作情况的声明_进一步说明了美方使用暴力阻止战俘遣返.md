Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 3rd. Our Special Correspondent Wu Min reports: The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's statement yesterday and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission Chairman, General Thimayya's reply to Hamblen, further explains the real reasons behind the recent US side's clamoring against the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and their "dissatisfaction" with the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work."

The US propaganda and official statements aim to make the world believe that after the US and ROK armies, supported by tanks and flamethrowers, slaughtered Korean and Chinese POWs with guns, poison gas, and bayonets, forcing them to "refuse repatriation," if these POWs were to receive explanations or "individual explanations and visits" in the presence of representatives from the five neutral nations, they would be "intimidated" or "coerced."

The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's statement exposes who is truly carrying out intimidation, exposes the purpose of the physical and mental coercion and pressure exerted in the POW camp, and who benefits from it.

The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's current serious problem is: the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee's special agents, under the protection of the US and ROK armies, are implementing the same reign of terror in the camps now under the control of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission as they did in the POW camps on Jeju Island and the South Korean mainland. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's statement says: "POWs were undoubtedly grouped and organized during the reception process, and this form of organization is still maintained in the current POW camps. All the leading elements among the POWs before being received by the Indian troops continue to exert influence on the POWs, and the POWs are subjected to great pressure, sometimes in the form of violence."

The one hundred and six Korean and Chinese POWs who were recently repatriated before the start of the explanation work are all living witnesses, proving that these "leading elements" and "groupings" use all means of terror, including "collective escape," to tear up the "Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's terms of reference" and prevent the repatriation of POWs. These "leading elements" and "groupings" have recently been reinforced by Kuomintang special agents from Taiwan and ROK officers, who refused to state their names and identities when transferred to the control of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, thereby infiltrating the camps.

The US Military Command deliberately distorts the "terms of reference" to achieve its own goals.

Thimayya said, "On several issues, it seems that they (the POWs) have also received incorrect information from a certain party concerned." Deliberately incorrect information is contained in "large numbers of leaflets, booklets, and other printed materials" issued by the US POW camp authorities. The POWs mistakenly believe that they will be released after ninety days, although the "terms of reference" stipulate a period of one hundred and twenty days.

	"And they were told that they (the POWs) would go to Taiwan at the end of this period, while according to the terms of reference, they have the right to go to any neutral country."

It is now clear that the reason why US Brigadier General Hamblen loudly opposes the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission explaining the "terms of reference" to the POWs is because doing so is contrary to the US plan to prevent the repatriation of POWs.

The US attacks the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission because the latter is fulfilling its duties in accordance with the Armistice Agreement. This shows that the US Military Command is now forced to openly oppose the "terms of reference" because the lies it has spread to the world are about to be exposed, the lie being that the POWs "would rather commit suicide than be repatriated."

Hamblen, the leader of the US "anti-repatriation group," opposed the presence of observing representatives from both sides when the POWs were transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, attempting to prevent the POWs from seeing representatives of their homeland.

Hamblen failed, and now he insists that his special agents can make the POWs "refuse to listen to explanations," attempting to achieve the same goal.

He insists that visits and explanations can only be conducted to "groups" of POWs, and these "groups" of POWs are under the terror control of his special agents.

The US military authorities have clearly adopted a delaying tactic, insisting that representatives of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army conduct explanations to the POWs at locations threatened and intimidated by nearby US troops.

After delaying the start date of the explanation work, the US Military Command is now demanding that the explanation work period not be delayed.

The US military authorities, the Kuomintang bandits, and the Syngman Rhee bandits are now openly supporting the atrocities and "collective escapes" of the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee special agents in the POW camps in order to undermine the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and tear up the "terms of reference."

### 中立国遣返委员会发表的关于工作情况的声明  进一步说明了美方使用暴力阻止战俘遣返

    中立国遣返委员会发表的关于工作情况的声明
    进一步说明了美方使用暴力阻止战俘遣返
    【新华社开城三日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：中立国遣返委员会昨天发表的声明和中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将给汉布伦的复信，更进一步地说明了最近美方对中立国遣返委员会的叫嚣和对“解释和访问工作细则”的“不满”的真正原因何在。
    美方宣传和官方声明的目的是要使全世界相信，在美军和李伪军在坦克和火焰喷射器的支援下用枪枝、毒气和刺刀屠杀朝中战俘迫使他们“拒绝遣返”以后，如果一定要这些战俘接受解释，或者要他们在五个中立国的代表在场的情况下接受“个别的解释与访问”，他们便会受到“恫吓”或“胁迫”。
    中立国遣返委员会的声明暴露了谁是真正在进行恫吓，暴露了在战俘营场中施行的肉体上和精神上的胁迫和压力的目的何在，对谁有好处。
    中立国遣返委员会目前严重的问题是：国民党和李承晚特务在美军和李伪军的保护下在济州岛和南朝鲜大陆战俘营中施行的恐怖统治已原封不动地搬到了现在在中立国遣返委员会看管下的营场里来。中立国遣返委员会的声明说：“战俘在接收工作进行时无疑已分组组织好了，这种组织形式在现在的战俘营中仍旧保留着。在被印度部队接收以前战俘中间所有的领袖分子现在仍继续对战俘行施影响，战俘遭受着很大的压力，有时这种压力是暴力行为。”
    最近在解释工作开始以前被遣返的一百零六名朝中战俘都是人证，证明了这种“领导分子”和“分组”使用一切恐怖手段，包括“集体逃跑”在内来撕毁“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，阻止战俘的遣返。这种“领导分子”和“分组”最近得到台湾国民党特务和李承晚军官的增援，他们在移交给中立国遣返委员会看管时拒绝说明姓名和身份，借此混入营场。
    美军司令部为了达到它自己的目的，故意曲解“职权范围”。
    蒂迈雅说，“在若干问题上，看来他们（战俘）从某一有关方面所获得的消息也是错误的。”故意弄错的消息包含在美方战俘营当局发出的“大批传单、小册子以及其他印刷品”中。战俘们误以为他们在九十天以后便可获释，虽然“职权范围”规定一百二十天的期限。
      “并且有人告诉他们，他们（战俘）在这个期限终了时将到台湾去，而依照职权范围，他们有权到任何中立国去。”
    现在已很明显，美方汉布伦准将所以大声反对中立国遣返委员会对战俘说明“职权范围”，就是因为这样做是与美方阻止战俘遣返的计划是矛盾的。
    美方攻击中立国遣返委员会，因为后者依照停战协定执行它的职责。这一点说明了美军司令部现在已被迫公开反对“职权范围”，因为它向全世界所撒的谎话就要被拆穿了，这个谎话便是战俘“宁可自杀也不愿遣返”。
    美方“反对遣返组组长”汉布伦曾反对双方观察代表在战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会时进行观察，企图借此阻止战俘看到他们祖国的代表。
    汉布伦失败了，现在他又坚决主张他的特务可以使得战俘“拒绝听取解释”，企图借此达到同样的目的。
    他坚决主张，只能对战俘“分组”进行访问和解释，而这些“分组”的战俘是在他的特务的恐怖控制之下的。
    美方军事当局显然采取了拖延策略，他们坚决主张朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的代表在受到附近美军的威胁和恫吓的地点向战俘进行解释。
    美军司令部在拖延了解释工作开始的日期以后，现在又要求解释工作期限不得推迟。
    美军当局、国民党匪帮和李承晚匪帮现在正在公开支持战俘营中国民党和李承晚特务的暴行和“集体逃跑”，以便破坏中立国遣返委员会的工作，撕毁“职权范围”。
