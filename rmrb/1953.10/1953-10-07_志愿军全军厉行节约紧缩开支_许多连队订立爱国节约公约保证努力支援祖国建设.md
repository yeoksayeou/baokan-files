Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 6th: The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are actively responding to the call from the motherland and the Chinese Communist Party's Chinese People's Volunteer Army Committee to practice strict economy and reduce expenditures with practical actions.

In late September, the Party committees of the Chinese Communist Party in the various senior command organs of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army convened meetings to seriously discuss and make resolutions to implement the instructions of the Chinese Communist Party's Chinese People's Volunteer Army Committee. The Party Committee of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in its resolution, required all subordinate units to start with clearing warehouses, reducing expenditures, and saving grain. The Party Committee of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army decided to launch a mass movement to cherish national property, practice strict economy, and reduce expenditures in its subordinate units, and decided and called on the entire army to save one or two liang of grain and a portion of forage grass allowance per person per day.

Now, the broad masses of commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have actively taken action. In order to save forage grass allowance, all units are organizing forces to cut grass themselves. A certain unit decided to hand over all forage grass allowance saved from August to December this year. They also handed over all 1.3 million jin of grain saved from January to mid-September this year to the state. The Third Battalion of a certain unit also handed over more than 4,500 jin of grain they saved to the state. Many units are seriously inspecting warehouses and clearing materials. In order to quickly clear the warehouse, the soldiers of a certain unit transported 50,000 to 70,000 jin of grain every day in a short period of time, and finally transported 170,000 jin of grain on the last day, completing the task ahead of schedule.

When building barracks, all units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army try to use old materials as much as possible. The commanders and fighters of a certain unit guarding the front line of Shangganling established a small iron factory, using steel plates from enemy broken tanks and other scrap iron to manufacture axes, saws, and other work tools for carpenters and masons, and also manufactured a large number of iron nails and two-pronged nails. They collected a large number of steel beams, artillery shell boxes, wooden boards and other materials discarded by the enemy to build barracks, saving a lot of materials for the motherland.

Many companies have established patriotic economy pacts to ensure that they will work hard to support national construction and cherish every grain of food, every bullet, every needle and every thread of the motherland. The entire commanders and fighters of the "First Class Meritorious Service Company" of a certain unit where "First Class Explosive Hero" Huang Jiafu is located, in the patriotic economy pact, have set out detailed methods for cherishing clothing, weapons, ammunition, and saving grain.

    志愿军全军厉行节约紧缩开支
    许多连队订立爱国节约公约保证努力支援祖国建设
    【新华社朝鲜前线六日电】中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员以实际行动积极响应祖国和中国共产党中国人民志愿军委员会关于厉行节约、紧缩开支的号召。
    九月下旬，中国共产党在中国人民志愿军各高级指挥机关中的党委会都召开了会议，认真讨论和作出执行中国共产党中国人民志愿军委员会指示的决议。中共中国人民志愿军某部党委会在决议中要求所属各部先从清理仓库、紧缩开支、节约粮食等方面着手；中共中国人民志愿军某部党委会决定在所属部队中开展一个群众性的爱护国家资财厉行节约、紧缩开支的运动，决定并号召全军每人每天节约一两粮食和一部分马草代金。
    现在，中国人民志愿军的广大指挥员、战斗员已经积极行动起来。为了节约马草代金，各部队都组织力量自己割草。某部决定将今年八月到十二月的全部马草代金节约上缴。他们还将今年一月到九月中节约的粮食一百三十万斤全部交给国家。某部第三营也将他们节约下来的四千五百多斤粮食交给了国家。许多部队已经在认真检查仓库，清理物资。某部一个班的战士为了迅速清理仓库，他们在短期内，每天搬运五万斤至七万斤粮食，最后一天竟搬运粮食十七万斤，提前完成了任务。
    中国人民志愿军各部在建造营房时都尽量利用旧材料。守卫在上甘岭前线的某部指挥员战斗员成立了小铁工厂，利用敌人破坦克上的钢板及其他废铁，制造木工、泥工所用的斧、锯等作业工具，还制造了大批铁钉和两爪钉。他们搜集了敌人丢弃的大批钢梁、炮弹箱、木板等建筑营房，为祖国节约了许多物资。
    许多连队订立了爱国节约公约，保证努力支援祖国建设，爱护祖国的一粮一弹、一针一线。“一级爆破英雄”黄家富所在的某部“一等功臣连”的全体指挥员、战斗员在爱国节约公约中，定出了爱护服装、武器、弹药和节约粮食的详细办法。
