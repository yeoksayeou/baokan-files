Wholeheartedly Serve Consumers

Record the Varieties Favored by the Masses
    The Qingdao Wholesale Store of the Shandong Provincial Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Fabrics Corporation, in order to improve supply work, established a "Residents' Needed Varieties Investigation and Research Group." This group used a "Shortage Log" and a "Daily Record of Buyers' Commodity Requirements" to record the goods, requirements, and opinions needed by the masses, and also held regular symposiums and conducted typical investigations to understand the needs of the masses.

    Through investigation, they learned that farmers' lives have improved, and they are willing to wear better quality, better-patterned cloth. In the past, the store formulated variety plans based on the needs of urban residents, which could not meet the needs of farmers. Due to years of bumper harvests, farmers are no longer satisfied with wearing self-woven and self-dyed cloth. Although they have not yet universally reached the level of wearing high-grade broadcloth and twill, they are willing to wear mid-grade, durable fine-count blue cloth. In the past, the store had very little fine-count blue cloth. After investigation, they increased it by one-third compared to the original plan, meeting the needs of farmers.

    Through investigation and understanding, due to the improved lives of urban consumers, workers are buying batting early to make cotton clothes and quilts early. The store corrected the problem of out-of-stock situations that occurred in previous years when processing was done only near the season, and processed and supplied them in advance.

    Now, according to the opinions of the masses, the store has revised its purchasing plan and added many items suitable for autumn and winter needs. (Zhao Minghao)

Let Residents Eat Fresh Vegetables
    Because vegetables are difficult to store, the consumer cooperatives in Shenyang City do not dare to purchase too much, and mostly buy and sell them on the same day. People can only buy vegetables from the cooperative at nine o'clock every day, and they are gone after three o'clock in the afternoon. There is often a shortage of vegetables on rainy days.

    In order to solve the difficulty of vegetable supply, Sun Qingyuan, a salesperson at the Third Consumer Cooperative in Beiguan District, Shenyang City, often consults with old farmers who grow vegetables about the characteristics of various vegetables. Through his gradual research, he created a method of preserving vegetables using sandy soil. That is, burying the vegetables in fine sand, and adopting different burial methods according to the nature of the vegetables, some need watering, some do not; some have the roots facing up, some have the roots facing down. This method of preserving vegetables can maintain the original quality of the vegetables. Cucumbers placed in the sand for ten days are still like they were just picked from the vine; ripe tomatoes placed in the sand for seven days remain unchanged. In this way, residents can often buy fresh vegetables.

Found a New Pattern
    Gu Rui Zhi of the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Fabrics Corporation, is responsible for selecting cotton cloth patterns. After watching the drama "Dawn Shines on Moscow," he knew that people's lives were improving year by year, and the old cloth patterns could no longer meet the needs of the people. So, he immediately began to select dark-colored patterns for autumn and winter. However, the patterns sent by the factories were very old. He thought about this problem every day. One day, he saw a theater performing "Peacock Flies Southeast." At this time, a beautiful picture of a peacock spreading its tail unfolded before his eyes. He thought that if some peacocks spreading their beautiful tail feathers were printed on dark backgrounds such as crimson and purplish-brown, it would be very beautiful. So, he suggested that the Shanghai Shenxin No. 6 Factory design the "Peacock Spreading Its Tail" pattern for cotton cloth. As a result, this kind of cloth was welcomed by people all over the country.

Commercial Communication Network
    The Andong City Military Personnel Store of the China National Department Store Corporation currently has thirty-two commercial correspondents active in each sales group. Whenever it is their turn to take a vacation, the correspondents go to the wholesale station in groups of three or five to visit, and exchange information by telephone during business hours. The dispatchers at the wholesale station also introduce newly arrived goods to the correspondents at any time. Many dispatchers also often visit the store to interview the correspondents. As soon as the military store discovers that the supply of a certain commodity is insufficient, it immediately notifies the wholesale station; when the wholesale station receives new goods, the military store can also purchase them in a timely manner, avoiding the situation of running out of stock on one side and having a backlog on the other. The wholesale station had a batch of gauze scarves that no one wanted. The correspondent Yan Zhucui discovered this when he went to the wholesale station to inspect the goods. Based on the needs of consumers, he suggested that the wholesale station convert the gauze scarves into handkerchiefs. As a result, after being processed into handkerchiefs, they were all bought by various units before they even entered the warehouse.

Carry out Mail-Order Sales Business
    The Dezhou Department Store Wholesale Station of the Shandong Provincial Company of the China National Department Store Corporation has been carrying out mail-order sales business since June. Mail-order sales means strengthening contact with agencies, cooperatives, and private businesses through letters, introducing the wholesale station's commodity varieties, specifications, etc., so that they can understand the commodity situation for selection and purchase. Since the mail-order sales business was launched in June, the number of cooperatives and private merchants coming to purchase goods has increased. Ten new out-of-town customers were added, and the turnover also increased by more than 200 million yuan. In July, they specially established a mail-order sales group to further develop the business, and a special person handles transportation matters for customers, so the number of customers coming to the store to purchase goods increased to eighteen, and various department stores worth 420 million yuan were sold. In August, the wholesale station received business inquiries from out-of-town areas ranging from eight to three or four customers a day, and the number of customers increased to thirty-two, selling 1,207 dozen pairs of shoes of various types and various daily necessities worth 640 million yuan, and supplied more than 200 million yuan worth of matches, sugar, etc. to cooperatives in Hengshui and Gucheng, Hebei Province.

"Group Responsibility System" Improved Work
    The retail department of the Hangzhou Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Fabrics Corporation was very busy because cotton cloth was selling well this year. The director and business personnel were busy with transactions during the day and busy with closing accounts at night, but the work was still not done well, and mistakes such as sending the wrong goods and calculating the wrong prices often occurred. The main reason was unclear division of labor and unclear responsibilities, so the station mobilized employees to learn from the experience of the "Personal Responsibility System" of the Shanghai Municipal Company's retail department of the China National Cotton Yarn and Fabrics Corporation, and combined it with the specific situation of the department to implement the "Group Responsibility System" on a trial basis. All salespersons were divided into four groups according to the variety and color of cotton cloth. A large indicator chart showing the group classification was marked on the counter. Customers could see which group sold which cloth as soon as they entered the door, and they could choose to buy by group and pay in a centralized manner. At the same time, sales, tabulation, and storage work were assigned according to the employees' work expertise. This greatly improved work efficiency, eliminated overtime, and at the same time, due to clear responsibilities, errors and accidents have been basically eliminated.

Exhibit Winter Goods Samples
    The Changchun Department Store Wholesale Store of the China National Department Store Corporation held a winter goods sample exhibition, inviting directors and salespersons of grassroots cooperatives to visit.

    A total of 450 kinds of samples were exhibited at the meeting, and winter goods samples accounted for more than 120 kinds. Because this year's winter goods have new styles and complete varieties, 14 grassroots cooperatives submitted order plans on the spot, totaling 3.822 billion yuan. The directors of the grassroots cooperatives said with satisfaction: In the past, we were asked to order and pick up goods by sending out a plan table; now it is great to see the samples first and then order. The directors and salespersons of the grassroots cooperatives also put forward specific opinions on the quality, specifications, prices, and colors of various fabrics used for this winter's change of seasons, so that the wholesale store initially understood the market needs, laying the foundation for organizing sources of goods and ensuring supply. At the same time, it further connected the plans of state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives.

Prepared Winter Coal
    The Tianjin Municipal Company of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Corporation, in order to do a good job in winter coal supply, has been carrying out coal transfer and rational storage work since the third quarter. The company's total coal inventory is now equivalent to more than 90% of the estimated sales volume in the fourth quarter of this year. In terms of coal varieties, appropriate adjustments have also been made according to the needs of the people's increased purchasing power and industrial production. For example, the amount of Yangquan coal, which is popular among citizens, has been prepared 100,000 tons more than the actual sales volume last year.

    In order to avoid the phenomenon of coal supply shortages in the past due to insufficient transportation tools in winter, this year the company, under the guidance of the Municipal Finance and Economic Committee and the Commercial Bureau, has signed contracts or agreements with various agencies, organizations, schools, factories, etc. to take coal in advance and pay in installments. By the end of September, the number of pre-taken coal had reached 157,000 tons, which is about one-third of the planned sales volume in the fourth quarter.

    全心全意为消费者服务
    把群众喜爱的品种记下来
    中国花纱布公司山东省公司青岛批发商店，为了改进供应工作，成立了“居民需要品种调查研究小组”。这个小组用“缺货日志”和“买主对商品要求每日记录”，把群众需要的货物和要求、意见等记上，并且还定时召开座谈会和作典型调查，了解群众需要。
    通过调查，他们了解到农民生活提高了，都愿意穿质量好、花样好的布。该店过去都是根据城市居民需要编制品种计划，不能满足农民需要。农民由于连年丰收，已不再满足于穿自织自染的布，虽然还没有普遍的达到穿高级的大底布和斜纹布水平，但愿意穿中级坚固的小底青、蓝布。过去该店只有很少的小底青、蓝布，经过调查，他们较原计划增加了三分之一，满足了农民的需要。
    通过调查了解，由于城市广大消费者生活提高，职工们都提前购买絮花，早做棉衣、棉被，该店就纠正了往年临季才加工形成脱销的毛病，提前进行了加工供应。
    现该商店根据群众意见，已修改了进货计划，添进了很多适合秋、冬季需要的物品。（赵明灏）
    让居民吃到新鲜菜
    由于蔬菜保管比较困难，沈阳市的消费合作社都不敢多采购，大多是当天买进，当天卖完。每天要到九点钟才能从合作社买到菜，下午三点多钟就没有了。下雨天还常常缺菜卖。
    为解决蔬菜供应困难，沈阳市北关区第三消费合作社营业员孙庆元，常向种菜老农民请教各种蔬菜特性，经他逐渐研究，创造了用沙地保存蔬菜的方法。就是把蔬菜埋在细沙子里，根据菜的性质采用不同的埋法，有的要浇水，有的不浇水；有的菜根朝上，有的菜根朝下。用这种方法保存蔬菜，可保持蔬菜原来的质量。在沙里放了十天的黄瓜，还像刚从架上摘下来的一样；熟透了的西红柿放在沙里七天，还丝毫不变。这样居民可以经常买到了新鲜的蔬菜。
    找到了新花样
    中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站顾瑞趾，担任挑选花布花样工作。他看了“曙光照耀着莫斯科”话剧后，知道人民生活一年一年提高，旧的花布色样已不能满足人民需要了。于是就立即着手挑选秋冬季深色花样。可是，各厂送来的花样都很陈旧。他天天考虑这个问题，有一天，他看到一家戏院在演“孔雀东南飞”，这时他眼前展开了一幅美丽的孔雀开屏图画，他想如果在大红、紫酱等底色上印一些张开美丽雀屏的孔雀，一定很美。于是他就建议上海申新六厂设计“孔雀开屏”花样花布，结果这种花布受到全国各地人民的欢迎。
    商业通讯网
    中国百货公司安东市军人商店现有三十二名商业通讯员，活跃在每个销货小组里。每当轮流休假的日子，通讯员都三五成群地到批发站去参观，在营业时间就用电话交流情况。批发站的调拨员也随时把新到的商品介绍给通讯员，许多调拨员也常到商店访问通讯员。军人商店一发现某种商品供应不足，就马上通知批发站；批发站来了新货，军人商店也能及时进货，避免了一面脱销、一面积压的情况。批发站有一批纱围巾，没人愿意要，通讯员阎珠翠到批发站看货时发现了，他根据消费者的需要，建议批发站将纱围巾改制成手帕。结果加工成手帕后，还没入库就被各单位全部买去了。
    开展函购推销业务
    中国百货公司山东省公司德州百货批发站，从六月份起开展了函购推销业务。函购推销就是通过信件和机关、合作社、私人商业加强联系，介绍批发站商品品种、规格等，使他们了解商品情况，以便选购。六月份开展了函购推销业务，各地合作社、私商来购货的增多了。增加了十户外地顾主，营业额也增加了两亿多元。七月份他们又专门成立了函购推销小组，进一步开展业务，并有一专人给顾主代办运输事务，因此到店购货的顾主增加到十八户，售出了各种百货四亿二千万元。八月份批发站每天接到外地来信联系业务的，多者八户少者三、四户，顾主已增加到三十二户，销出各种鞋一千二百零七打，及各种日用百货总值六亿四千万元，并供应了河北省衡水、故城等合作社火柴、糖等两亿多元。    （贾占升）
    “分组负责制”改进了工作
    中国花纱布公司杭州采购供应站门市部，因今年棉布畅销，工作非常忙，主任和业务人员白天忙交易，晚上忙结账，可是工作仍然做不好，经常发生货发错、价算错等事。主要原因是分工不清、职责不明，于是该站就发动职工学习中国花纱布公司上海市公司门市部“专人负责制”的经验，结合本部门具体情况，试行了“分组负责制”。全体营业员按棉布的品种、花色，分门别类，编成四个组。柜台上标明分组分类的大幅指示图表，顾客一进门就看到什么组卖什么布，可按组选购，集中付款。同时又按营业员的工作擅长，分任售货、制表、保管等工作。这样工作效率大大提高，消灭了加班加点现象，同时由于职责分明，差错事故已基本上消灭。
    展览冬货样品
    中国百货公司长春百货批发商店，举办了冬货样品展览会，邀请基层合作社主任、营业员来参观。
    会上一共展览了四百五十种样品，冬货样品占一百二十多种。由于今年冬货样式新、品种全，当时就有十四个基层社提出了订货计划，总值达三十八亿二千二百万元。各基层社主任满意地说：过去发一张计划表，就叫我们订提货计划；现在先看样品，然后再订货是太好了。各基层社主任和营业员，还对今冬换季用的各种布匹质量、规格、价格、花色等提出了具体意见，使批发商店初步摸清了市场需要情况，给组织货源、保证供应打下了基础。同时，也进一步使国营商业和合作社计划衔接起来。
    准备好了冬季用煤
    中国煤业建筑器材公司天津市公司，为作好冬季煤炭供应工作，从第三季度开始，就进行了调运煤炭和合理储备工作。现该公司煤炭总库存量已相当于今年第四季度预计销售量的百分之九十以上。在煤炭品种方面，也根据人民购买力提高及工业生产的需要，作了适当的调配。如市民喜欢用的阳泉煤，就比去年实销量多准备了十万吨。
    为了避免过去在冬季因为运输工具不足煤炭供应不上的现象，今年该公司在市财政经济委员会及商业局的指导下，和各机关、团体、学校、工厂等签订了提前取煤分期付款的合同或协议。到九月底，预取数量已达十五万七千吨，约等于第四季度计划销售量的三分之一。
