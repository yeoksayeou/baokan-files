    The Dailing Experimental Bureau of the Northeast Forest Industry Bureau has saved the state a lot of expenses in the past six months by conscientiously implementing the policy of increasing production and practicing strict economy. In terms of practicing strict economy, unnecessary institutions and redundant personnel were reduced to fill vacancies in other bureaus. The original eleven logging yards were gradually reduced to seven, and the original 1,300 workers were gradually reduced to 707. The experimental bureau originally had a total of 667 management personnel, and 217 were reduced from January to August. This improved work efficiency and saved management costs, reducing unit costs by 14.6% and increasing production efficiency, completing monthly and quarterly plans. It is expected that the annual allocation of timber will be exceeded by 30,000 cubic meters. In terms of increasing production and increasing income: In the area of forest railway transportation, under the slogan of strengthening planned management, accelerating the turnover of locomotives and rolling stock, and hauling more and running faster, 86.4% of the annual transportation task had been completed by the beginning of the third quarter, and from September to the end of the year, the planned transportation task can be exceeded by 70,000 cubic meters. In terms of harvesting, the rational timber production and rational use of materials have been strictly implemented. For example, the Liu Fang team in the Fourth Logging Yard has increased income by more than 15 million yuan in the past eight months by using the method of "destroying poor materials, cutting good materials, and increasing timber prices."
    In order to further develop the production increase and economy campaign, the Dailing Experimental Bureau of the Northeast Forest Industry Bureau has formulated a new plan on the basis of the past good development of the production increase and economy campaign:
    1. In terms of harvesting: improve product quality, do a good job in rational timber production and rational use of materials, take the advanced figure Liu Fang as a typical example for promotion; strengthen the education of inspectors and do a good job in autumn forest fire prevention; do a good job in preparing for 1954, laying the foundation for the work in 1954; complete financial costs and do a good job in security work.
    2. In terms of forest transportation: accelerate the turnover of locomotives and rolling stock, tap the potential of machinery, and exceed the transportation plan of 70,000 cubic meters; save raw materials and strengthen scheduling; implement operating procedures and pay attention to safe transportation.
    3. In terms of timber processing: ensure quality, complete tasks, and save timber; process fourth-grade materials into finished products, and implement a piece-rate wage system; do a good job in safe production and eliminate personal accidents.
    4. In terms of capital construction: do a good job of "good, fast, and economical", strive to complete the construction tasks before freezing, pay attention to saving; do a good job in high-altitude operations, strengthen political education for workers, save raw materials, and pay attention to specifications and quality.

    Also Reported: The 97km Work Unit of the Boketu Forest Industry Bureau in Inner Mongolia exceeded its production tasks every month during the five months of summer harvesting and transporting from April to August this year, due to the formulation of workshop team production plans, mobilizing employees to make rationalization proposals, and launching production competitions. In five months, a total of 10,000 cubic meters of timber was overfulfilled.
    At the beginning of the summer harvesting and transporting of timber, some cadres had the mistaken idea of "taking a rest" and "too much rain and muddy roads" that could not guarantee the completion of the planned tasks. The leaders of the work unit conducted education and corrected these ideological situations of the cadres, and established confidence in completing the tasks in the minds of the cadres. The Democratic Management Committee first discussed the production plan, publicized it to the workshop teams, and announced the figures for completing the tasks in a timely manner. In this way, the employees grasped the progress of production in their minds, and at the same time, it encouraged the production enthusiasm of the employees.
    During the summer harvesting and transporting operations, each workshop team formulated a production plan and formed a harvesting and transporting mutual aid group. The workshop teams carried out competitions, and there were "attendance black and red dot competition" charts and "rationalization proposal" charts in the workshops. These two charts effectively promoted the competition and improved production efficiency, so that the attendance rate of harvesting and transporting workers increased by 15%, and transportation exceeded the quota by 20%. Forty-five workers received material rewards in the competition, and the 80-kilometer timber transportation team received the red flag. Rationalization proposals have also increased significantly.

    带岭森林工业实验局按月按季完成计划
    博克图九七公里作业所连续五个月超额完成木材采运任务
    东北森林工业局带岭实验局，半年多来由于认真执行了贯彻增加生产，厉行节约的方针，给国家节省许多开支。在厉行节约方面，精减了不必要的机构和冗员，以充实其他局的缺员。把原十一个伐木工场逐渐缩减成为七个，原一千三百多名工人逐渐缩减为七百零七人。实验局管理人员原共六百六十七人，从一月到八月共减去二百一十七人。这样，提高了工作效率，节省了管理费用。使单位成本降低了百分之十四点六，生产效率也提高了，做到按月、按季完成计划，预计全年可超额完成调拨木材三万立方公尺。在增加生产，增加收入方面：森林铁路运输方面，在加强计划管理，加速机、台车周转和多拉快跑的口号下，到第三季度初已完成全年运输任务百分之八十六点四，由九月至年底可超过计划运输任务七万立方公尺。在采伐方面严格地执行了合理造材，合理用材，仅第四伐木场刘芳小组八个月来用“墩坏材、截好材、提高木材价格计算”的方法，就增加收入一千五百多万元。
    为进一步开展增产节约竞赛，东北森林工业局带岭实验局，又在过去开展增产节约竞赛的良好基础上拟定了新的计划：
    一、采伐方面：提高产品质量，作好合理造材，合理用材，以先进人物刘芳为典型，进行推广；加强验收员的教育，作好秋季护林防火工作；作好一九五四年的准备作业，打下一九五四年的工作基础；完成财务成本，作好保安工作。
    二、森林运输方面：加速机、台车周转，挖掘机械潜力，超额完成七万立方公尺运输计划；节省原料，加强调度工作；执行操作规程，注意安全运输。
    三、制材加工方面：要保证质量，完成任务，节约木材；加工四等材为成材，并贯彻计件工资制；作好安全生产，根除人身事故。
    四、基本建设方面：要作好“好、快、省”，争取结冻前完成建筑任务，注意节约；要作好高空作业，加强对工人政治教育，节约原材料，并注意规格质量。（陈守志）
    又讯：内蒙古博克图森林工业局九七公里作业所，在今年四月到八月的五个月的夏采搬运中，由于制定了车间小组生产计划、发动职工提合理化建议和展开了生产竞赛，每个月都超额完成生产任务，五个月中，共超额完成了一万立方公尺木材的任务。
    在夏采运搬木材开始时，有部分干部存在着“歇一歇”和“雨多道泞”不能保证完成计划任务的错误观点。该作业所领导方面，针对干部的这些思想情况，进行了教育和纠正，在干部思想中树立了完成任务的信心。民主管理委员会首先讨论了生产计划，向车间小组进行了宣传，把完成任务的数字也即时公布出来。这样就使得职工心中掌握了生产的进度，同时也鼓舞了职工的生产热情。
    在夏采运搬作业中各车间小组都制订了生产计划，并组成了采运互助组。各小组工铺开展了竞赛，工铺内有“出勤黑红点竞赛”图表和“合理化建议”图表。这两种图表有力地推动了竞赛，提高了生产效率，因而使采运工人的出勤率提高了百分之十五，运搬超过了定额的百分之二十。有四十五名工人在竞赛中得到了物质奖励，八十公里运材队得到了红旗。合理化建议也有显著的增加。
