    Central and Southern Grain Departments Strengthen New Grain Storage Work
    Sichuan Province Adjusts Grain Transfer Routes to Reduce Transportation Costs
    [Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 14th] As the work of purchasing new grain and collecting agricultural tax in kind progresses, the state warehouses are storing increasing amounts of grain. Grain departments in the Central and Southern regions are strengthening the storage of the new grain.
    This year, the Central and Southern regions paid early attention to the storage of new grain. Before the peak wheat season and the collection of summer agricultural tax in kind, the grain departments in the wheat-producing areas of Henan and Hubei provinces had warehouses cleaned and disinfected with a capacity to hold tens of billions of jin of wheat. In the central major grain-producing areas of Guangdong Province, more than 300 pest control technicians were organized to go to the countryside to inspect warehouses. After September, as the autumn grain purchasing work entered its peak season and the collection of autumn agricultural tax in kind was about to begin, grain departments in various places successively began safety inspections of warehouses. Hunan conducted a centralized warehouse cleaning and disinfection week in mid-September. Before this, more than half of the province's granaries had been cleaned and disinfected. Since late September, various parts of Henan have been sun-drying, wind-screening, and fumigating autumn grain purchases with pesticides. The autumn grain after sun-drying is very dry and easy to store. The grain departments in Qinyang, Qi County, and even the open-air grain warehouses in Anyang City have strengthened these tasks and stored the grain very well. This year, the grain departments in the Central and Southern regions have built many new sheds, simple warehouses, and sturdy warehouses in major grain-producing areas such as Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei. Before the end of October, the new warehouses built in various places will be able to hold more than ten billion jin of new grain. Due to the construction of these sheds and warehouses, the phenomenon of temporarily storing grain in the open air in some areas during the autumn harvest season due to insufficient warehouse space has been reduced compared to previous years.
    In order to make grain storage a regular practice, grain warehouses in the Central and Southern regions will implement a warehouse cleaning and hygiene day system starting in October. In addition to regular storage work, one day each month will be designated to thoroughly eliminate pests, weeds, sewage, etc. inside and outside the warehouse. Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hubei, Guangxi and other five provinces will successively carry out typical experiments on grain storage and preservation, in order to more carefully summarize and disseminate the experience of grain preservation in the south. The grain departments of Hunan and Hubei provinces have selected granaries in lake areas, mountainous areas, and plains as pilot sites and have begun this experimental work.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 14th] Grain departments at all levels in Sichuan Province are strengthening grain allocation plans and implementing rational transportation, greatly reducing transportation costs. According to incomplete statistics, from January to September this year, grain departments at all levels in Sichuan Province adjusted 20 grain transfer routes, reducing the freight cost per 10,000 jin of grain by 100,470 yuan, saving the state a total of 17.8 billion yuan. For example, the surplus grain in Kaijiang County was previously transported by manpower to Dachuan County, and then exported via the Qujiang River and Jialing River to Chongqing by wooden boat. Since June this year, it has been transported by truck from Liangping County to Wanxian for export, shortening the transportation distance by 964 kilometers, saving 1.36 billion yuan in freight costs in less than four months. Another example is the surplus grain in the Xinchang area of Guangyuan County, which was previously transported by manpower to the urban area for supply. Now, it is rerouted to be transported by manpower to Huangjinkou first, and then transported to the urban area by wooden boat, reducing manpower transportation and reducing freight costs by one-quarter.
    However, on the other hand, wasteful phenomena have not been completely overcome in the grain transfer work in Sichuan Province. To this end, the storage and transportation department of the Sichuan Provincial Grain Bureau has made a detailed allocation plan, requiring all localities to correctly grasp the direction of grain circulation and the laws of supply and demand, so that the grain allocation work can be further rationalized and made more economical, striving to continue to reduce freight costs by 10 percent, and planning to save the state another 18.3 billion yuan in freight costs in the coming year.

    中南粮食部门加强新粮保管工作
    四川省调整粮食调运路线降低运输费用
    【新华社武汉十四日电】随着收购新粮、征收公粮工作的展开，国家仓库储粮日益增多，中南区粮食部门正加强对新粮的保管工作。
    今年中南各地对新粮的保管工作注意得很早，当小麦上市最盛和征收夏季公粮之前，河南和湖北两省小麦产地的粮食部门进行清扫消毒的仓库就能够容纳小麦十数亿斤，广东省中部主要产粮区也组织了三百多个防虫技术人员下乡清查仓库。九月以后秋粮收购工作进入旺季，征收秋季公粮也将开始，各地粮食部门又先后开始了仓库的安全检查，湖南各地在九月中旬进行了一次清仓消毒突击周，在此以前，全省已有一半以上的粮仓进行过清仓消毒。河南各地自九月下旬对收购的秋粮进行曝晒、风筛和药杀熏蒸，经过曝晒后的秋粮都很干燥，易于保藏；沁阳、淇县等地粮食部门以至安阳市的露天粮食仓库都因加强了这些工作，把粮食保管得很好。今年中南区粮食部门在湖南、江西、湖北等主要产粮区新建了很多货棚、简易仓库和坚固的仓库，十月底以前各地陆续建成的新仓库就可容纳十亿斤以上的新粮。由于这些货棚、仓库的建造，往年秋收季节里某些地区因仓库不足以致临时把粮食露天存放的现象已经减少。
    为了使粮食保管工作经常化，中南各地粮食仓库从十月份起将实行仓库清洁卫生日制度，除了经常的保管工作外，每月再选定一天，彻底清除仓库内外的虫害、杂草、污水等等。湖南、广东、江西、湖北、广西等五省将先后开展粮食储藏、保管的典型试验工作，以便更细致地总结和传播南方粮食保管经验。湖南、湖北两省粮食部门已在湖泊区、山岳区和平原区选定试点的粮仓，开始了这个试验工作。
    【新华社成都十四日讯】四川省人民政府各级粮食部门加强粮食调拨计划，实行合理运输，大大减少了运费开支。据不完全统计，今年一至九月，四川省各级粮食部门调整了粮食调运路线二十条，使每一万斤粮食降低运费十万零四千七百余元，共为国家节省了开支一百七十八亿元。例如开江县的余粮，以往都是先用人力运到达县，再用木船经渠江、嘉陵江转重庆出口。自今年六月份起，改用汽车由梁平县转万县出口，缩短了运输里程九百六十四公里，在不到四个月的时间内，就节省了运费十三亿六千万元。又如广元县新场区的余粮，以往都是用人力运城区供应，现在改道先用人力运至黄金口，再用木船运城区，减少了人力运输，使运费降低四分之一。
    但另一方面，在四川省粮食调运工作中，浪费现象仍未完全克服。为此，四川省粮食厅储运部门已作出详细的调拨计划，要求各地正确掌握粮食流转方向和供求法则，使粮食的调拨工作进一步做到合理、经济，争取继续降低运费百分之十，计划在今后一年内再为国家节省运费开支一百八十三亿元。
