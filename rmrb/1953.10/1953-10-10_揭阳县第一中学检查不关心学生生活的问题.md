Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Chen Mingyuan, Principal of Jieyang County No. 1 Middle School in Guangdong Province, writes: Zhang Wei’s criticism in the “Reader's Letters Summary” column on August 24 regarding our school's improper handling of meals for students staying on campus during the summer vacation is correct. We have convened relevant staff to conduct an in-depth examination of this issue. When formulating the summer meal system for students, the school leadership only thought about "reducing trouble" for themselves and did not take good care of the students' lives. When the head of the general affairs office specifically handled the issue of students joining the meals during the summer vacation, he mechanically emphasized the system, which increased the students' difficulties. During this examination, we also discovered that in the past, we had consistently not paid enough attention to improving meals and improving the health of students. We are determined to accept the students' criticism and earnestly and gradually improve the students' meals in the future.

    揭阳县第一中学检查不关心学生生活的问题
    广东省揭阳县第一中学校长陈明苑来信：八月二十四日“读者来信摘要”栏中张纬鏺同学对我校处理暑期留校同学膳食不当的批评是正确的，我们已召集有关工作人员对这个问题进行深入检查。我校领导方面在拟订同学暑期膳食制度时，只想自己
  “减少麻烦”，没有很好地照顾同学的生活。总务处负责人具体处理暑期留校同学入伙问题时，又机械强调制度，增加了同学的困难。在这次检查中，我们还发现过去对搞好伙食、改善学生健康情况的工作一贯不够重视。我们决心接受同学的批评，切实逐步搞好今后学生伙食。
