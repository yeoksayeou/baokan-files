    Anshan City Fully Launches Grassroots Primary Election Work
    The grassroots election work is being fully launched in Anshan, the steel capital of the motherland. People from all walks of life in Anshan City are actively participating in the primary election with joy. Every day, many people happily go to the two hundred plus voter registration stations in the city's one hundred and seventy-one electoral districts to register. The primary election propaganda activities are being carried out in depth in conjunction with the campaign to increase production and practice economy.
    The primary election movement in Anshan City began after thorough preparation and careful planning. As early as late May, the election committees of Anshan City and its subordinate districts had been established and carried out various preparatory tasks. In order to closely integrate with production and facilitate leadership, the Anshan City Election Committee staggered the timing of the primary elections in the suburbs and urban districts. In early July, the primary election work in the suburbs began first; at the same time, the urban districts also began primary election propaganda. After the successful completion of the grassroots elections in the suburbs in mid-September, the population census and voter registration work in the urban districts began successively in late September. The population census and voter registration in the urban districts was first conducted in the Tiedong District, and the experience gained was then推广(tuī guǎng - disseminated or promoted) to the other four districts. Currently, the population census and voter registration in the electoral districts under the Tiedong District is nearing completion, and voter lists have been announced in a few electoral districts. The population census and voter registration in the other districts will also be completed by mid-October.
    The primary election propaganda in the urban districts is being carried out in depth in close conjunction with the campaign to increase production and practice economy. More than 300 speakers and more than 3,000 propagandists and propaganda activists who have been trained are enthusiastically explaining the basic principles of the Election Law and the importance of the population census and voter registration to the people of the city. The primary election work groups in the various factories, mines, construction sites, and larger institutions and enterprises under the Anshan Iron and Steel Company are also actively carrying out primary election propaganda to the workers and staff of their respective units. In the propaganda, each district, in addition to oral propaganda, also widely adopted literary and artistic propaganda forms that are popular with the masses to carry out propaganda in various electoral districts. The cultural centers of each district organized literary and artistic propaganda teams and slide projection teams, and in the evening they would beat gongs and drums to perform in the streets and workers' dormitories. The four literary and artistic propaganda teams in Tiedong District performed more than 40 literary and artistic programs in three days, educating more than 24,000 people. Movie theaters, theaters, as well as radio stations, blackboards, and big-character posters in factories, mines, enterprises, and construction sites throughout the city also cooperated in carrying out primary election propaganda.
    The primary election propaganda activities and voter registration work have further aroused the labor enthusiasm of the steel capital workers. Anshan City's special-grade labor models Meng Tai, Zhang Mingshan, Wang Jinzhong, and Li Feng'en unanimously stated at the primary election symposium held on September 20 that they would lead the city's workers to do a good job in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and actively participate in the primary election. Meng Tai, the head of the repair shop of the Iron Smelting Plant, who is known as the "Old Hero" by the workers, led the workers to successfully create eight mechanized and automated equipment at the end of September as a gift to the primary election. Many factories and construction sites of Angang have put forward the loud slogan of "Do a good job in increasing production and practicing economy to welcome the primary election" in the production increase and economy practice competition. Not long ago, Tong Zhankui, a municipal labor model who was elected as a district people's representative in the Taiping Village construction site electoral district of Angang, recently put forward a rationalization proposal for saving cement in repairing chimneys, saving the country more than 19.6 million yuan in wealth.

    鞍山市全面展开基层普选工作
    基层选举工作正在祖国的钢都——鞍山全面展开。鞍山市各界人民都以欣喜的心情积极参加普选。市内一百七十一个选区里的二百多个选民登记站每天都有许多人愉快地前往登记。普选的宣传活动正结合着增产节约运动深入地展开着。
    鞍山市的普选运动是在经过充分准备和周密计划之后开始的。早在五月下旬，鞍山市和所属各区的选举委员会就已经建立起来，并且进行了各项准备工作。为了密切结合生产和便于领导，鞍山市选举委员会把郊区和市内各区普选的时间错开。七月上旬，郊区普选工作首先开始；同时，市内各区也开始进行了普选宣传。郊区的基层选举在九月中旬全部胜利结束以后，市内各区的人口调查和选民登记工作便在九月下旬先后展开。市内各区的人口调查和选民登记又在铁东区首先进行，取得经验后再向其他四个区推广。目前，铁东区所属各选区的人口调查和选民登记已将近结束，少数选区并已公布了选民名单；其他各区的人口调查和选民登记也将在十月中旬内完成。
    市内各区的普选宣传正密切结合着增产节约运动深入展开。三百多名报告员以及经过训练的三千多名宣传员和宣传积极分子，正向全市人民热情地讲解选举法的基本原则和人口调查、选民登记的重要意义。鞍山钢铁公司所属各厂、矿、工地以及市内各个比较大的机关、企业里的普选工作组也向本单位的工人们和工作人员们积极进行普选宣传。各区在宣传中，除口头宣传外还普遍采用了为群众所喜闻乐见的文艺宣传形式深入各选区进行宣传。每一个区的文化馆都组织了文艺宣传队和幻灯队，一到傍晚便敲锣打鼓地到街道和工人宿舍去演出。铁东区的四个文艺宣传队三天中就演出了四十多个文艺节目，使二万四千多人受到了教育。全市的电影院、剧院以及各厂、矿、企业和工地上的广播站、黑板报、大字报等宣传工具也都配合进行了普选宣传。
    普选的宣传活动和选民登记工作引起了钢都工人们劳动热情的进一步高涨。鞍山市特等劳动模范孟泰、张明山、王进忠、李凤恩等人在九月二十日举行的普选座谈会上，一致表示要带领全市工人搞好增产节约运动，积极参加普选。被工人们称为“老英雄”的炼铁厂修理场场长孟泰在九月底带领工人创制成功了八项机械化自动化设备，作为给普选的献礼。鞍钢许多工厂和工地的工人们在增产节约竞赛中提出了“搞好增产节约，迎接普选”的响亮口号。不久以前在鞍钢太平村工地选区当选为区人民代表的市劳动模范佟占奎最近提出了一项修烟筒节省洋灰的合理化建议，为国家节约了一千九百六十多万元财富。    （新华社）
