    Celebrating the Fourth Anniversary of National Day
    Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party
    The People's Republic of China has reached its fourth glorious National Day since its founding. I would like to express my boundless joy to celebrate this great festival.
    In the past four years, under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong, the great Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government, our country has achieved great victories in various constructions. These victories are undoubtedly unprecedented in Chinese history.
    Since the Central People's Government announced its establishment on October 1, 1949, our great motherland has carried out various great constructions under the condition of one victory after another. On February 7 this year, the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, based on the glorious achievements of the past three years, adopted the three major political tasks for this year. These tasks are: (1) to continue to strengthen the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, so as to strive for a reasonable peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and other related issues in the Far East; (2) to concentrate efforts, increase production and practice economy, and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1953 economic construction plan, national defense construction plan, and social and cultural construction plan, so as to create a good start for the first five-year plan of national construction; (3) to actively prepare for the elections of local people's congresses at all levels and the National People's Congress to realize the further democratization of the country. In addition to these resolutions, Chairman Mao Zedong also made three major instructions to guide us: to strengthen the resistance against US aggression and aid Korea, to learn from the Soviet Union, and to oppose bureaucracy.
    In the past nine months of this year, the people of the whole country have made great efforts to realize the above-mentioned great political tasks and have achieved great victories and achievements.
    First of all, in terms of the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, thanks to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side with the heroic Korean People's Army for two years and nine months, severely hitting the US-Li bandit army on the battlefield; in the armistice negotiations that have been delayed for two years, it has also completely shattered all the shameless conspiracies and tricks of US imperialism and insisted on the policy of peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, forcing the US-Li bandit gang to sign the armistice agreement under the pressure of the world's peaceful and democratic forces. This great victory fully proves the correctness of what Chairman Mao said: "The People's Republic of China cannot be bullied, the great peace camp headed by the Soviet Union cannot be violated, and the peace-loving people of the world cannot be deceived." And the correctness of what Chairman Malenkov said: "No disputes or outstanding issues cannot be resolved peacefully on the basis of mutual agreement between the countries concerned." At the same time, it has greatly strengthened the determination and confidence of the peace-loving people of the world to strive for peace and achieve victory.
    While the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea has achieved great victories, the task of the first year of the national construction five-year plan has also achieved great achievements. According to the report of Vice Premier Chen Yun, in the first half of this year, in the industrial field, five central industrial ministries completed 101 percent of the half-year plan, and ten of the twenty major products exceeded the plan, and the output of private industry also increased significantly; in the transportation field, the railway completed 117 percent of the half-year plan, and river transportation completed 120 percent of the half-year plan; in the agricultural field, the production situation in most parts of the country is very good; domestic and foreign trade also overfulfilled the plan. Due to the rapid progress of economic construction, the continuous improvement and improvement of the lives of workers and peasants, cultural construction has also achieved great achievements; a large number of talents have been cultivated, and good conditions have been prepared for the country's major construction. Recently, the Soviet government, with selfless brotherly friendship, generously decided to provide our country's economic construction with long-term, comprehensive and huge assistance, helping our country to build and renovate 141 large-scale projects. This brotherly and huge assistance will undoubtedly provide a firm guarantee for the completion of our country's economic construction five-year plan. At the same time, it shows the greatness of the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union.
    The general election work has been universally and deeply launched in all parts of the country. Through this work, the political consciousness and active spirit of the broad masses of the people, especially the workers and peasants, have been greatly improved, and the people's democratic dictatorship has been further consolidated, creating good conditions for the future convocation of the National People's Congress.
    In the struggle against the new three evils of bureaucracy, commandism and violation of laws and disciplines, we have also achieved considerable results. All personnel serving the country have received profound and serious education through this movement, can better serve the people, and thus the completion of all national construction plans has also been further guaranteed.
    All these glorious victories and achievements of our glorious and great motherland are gratifying to us and our friends, but they are envied by our enemies, the US-Chiang and US-Li bandit gangs. US imperialists are not reconciled to their failure in China, and even more unwilling to see our progress. It must carry out struggles and sabotage our country's construction and world democracy and peace from all aspects in order to fulfill its ambitions of plundering war profits and dominating the world. When the Korean Armistice Agreement had not yet been signed, the US-Li bandit gang carried out open sabotage; at present, in addition to creating sabotage incidents every day on the issue of repatriation of prisoners, it is also a well-known fact that it provides assistance to the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Therefore, we really cannot relax our vigilance for a moment on the future of the Korean issue, and we should make even greater efforts to strive for peace in Asia and the world. Domestically, members of our democratic parties must actively participate in the construction of the motherland under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, work hard to increase production, practice strict economy, so that the great construction plan of the motherland's industrialization can be realized quickly. We must also work hard on the general election to further consolidate the system of people's democratic dictatorship. Overseas Chinese of all strata, because they are under the direct rule and oppression of the enemy, should give full play to the fine tradition of patriotism, unite as one, love the motherland, and fight to defend their legitimate rights and interests.
    We believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we will surely be able to strive for greater victories on the basis of victory!
    Long live the great People's Republic of China!
    Glory to the Chinese Communist Party, the organizer of the Chinese people's victory!
    Glory to the great people's leader, Chairman Mao Zedong!

    庆祝国庆四周年
    中国致公党主席  陈其尤
    中华人民共和国自成立以来，今年已届第四个光辉灿烂的国庆了。我谨以无限的欢欣来祝贺这一个伟大的节日。
    四年以来，我们的国家，在伟大的毛泽东主席、伟大的中国共产党及中央人民政府的领导下，各种建设都获得了极大的胜利。这些胜利，无疑的是中国有史以来所未有的。
    从一九四九年十月一日中央人民政府宣布成立之日起，我们的伟大祖国即在一个胜利接一个胜利的条件之下进行了各种伟大的建设。今年二月七日，人民政协第一届全国委员会第四次会议更在以往三年的辉煌成就的基础之上，通过了今年的三大主要政治任务。这些任务是：（1）继续加强抗美援朝斗争，以争取朝鲜问题和远东其他有关问题的合理的和平解决；（2）集中力量，增产节约，争取完成和超额完成一九五三年的经济建设计划，国防建设计划与社会文化建设计划，为国家建设的第一个五年计划造成良好的开端；（3）积极准备地方各级人民代表大会和全国人民代表大会的选举，实现国家的进一步的民主化。除了这些决议之外，毛泽东主席更作出了必须加强抗美援朝，学习苏联和反对官僚主义等三大指示以指导我们。
    本年九个月来，全国人民对于实现上述的伟大政治任务所作的努力，都获得了很大的胜利与成绩。
    首先，就抗美援朝斗争而言，由于英勇的中国人民志愿军在两年又九个月中与英雄的朝鲜人民军并肩作战，在战场上沉重地打击了美李匪军；在拖延了两年的停战谈判上，也彻底粉碎了美帝国主义的一切无耻阴谋与诡计，并坚持和平解决朝鲜问题的方针，使美李匪帮在全世界和平民主力量的压迫之下，不得不签订了停战协定。这一个伟大的胜利，完全证明了毛主席所说：“中华人民共和国是不能欺负的，以苏联为首的伟大和平阵营是不能侵犯的，全世界和平人民是不能欺骗的。”和马林科夫主席所说的：“没有任何纠纷或悬案不能在有关各国互相协议的基础上和平解决”的正确性。同时也大大加强了全世界和平人民争取和平的决心和获得胜利的信心。
    与抗美援朝斗争取得伟大胜利的同时，国家建设五年计划第一年的任务也获得了伟大的成就。根据陈云副总理的报告，今年上半年，工业方面有五个中央工业部完成了半年计划的百分之一零一，二十种主要产品有十种超过了计划，私营工业产量亦有很多增加；运输方面，铁路完成了半年计划的百分之一百一十七，河运完成了半年计划的百分之一百二十；农业方面全国大部分地区生产情况很良好；国内外贸易亦超额完成了计划。由于经济建设的飞跃进步，工农生活不断的改善和提高，文化建设亦因之有伟大的成就；培养了大批人才，为国家大建设准备了良好的条件。最近苏联政府又以无私的兄弟般的友谊，慷慨地决定给我国经济建设以长期的、全面的巨大援助，帮助我国新建与改建一百四十一项规模巨大的工程，这种兄弟般的巨大帮助，对我国经济建设五年计划的完成，无疑地作了坚决的保证。同时说明了中苏两国牢不可破的友谊的伟大。
    普选工作，已在全国各地普遍深入地展开了。通过这项工作，大大地提高了广大人民特别是工农群众的政治觉悟和积极精神，更进一步巩固了人民民主专政，为将来召开全国人民代表大会创造了好的条件。
    在反对官僚主义，反对命令主义与反对违法乱纪的新三反的斗争上，我们亦获得了不小的成绩。一切服务于国家的人员，经过这个运动，得到了深刻而严肃的教育，可以更好地为人民服务，因而国家的一切建设计划的完成，也得到了进一步的保证。
    所有我们光荣伟大的祖国这一些光辉的胜利与成绩，都是我们和我们的友人们欣喜的，然而，却是我们的敌人美蒋和美李匪帮们所嫉视的。美帝国主义者不甘心于它在中国的失败，尤不愿见我们的进步。它一定要进行挣扎，从各方面来进行破坏我国的建设与世界的民主和平，以遂其掠取战争利润和统治世界的野心。当朝鲜停战协定尚未签字之时，美李匪帮就进行了公开的破坏；目前除了在遣俘问题上天天制造破坏事件外，更对于蒋介石残余匪帮给予援助，更是人们共知的事实。因此，我们对于朝鲜问题的前途，实在不能一刻放松警惕，而对于亚洲与世界和平，尤应加倍努力以争取。就国内说，我们民主党派的成员，必须在毛主席与共产党的领导之下，积极参加祖国的建设，努力增产，厉行节约，使祖国工业化的伟大建设计划可以迅速实现。我们还要努力于普选的工作，以进一步巩固人民民主专政的制度。海外各阶层的华侨，由于处在敌人直接统治压迫之下，更应该发挥一贯的爱国主义优良传统，团结一致，爱护祖国，并为保卫自己的正当权益而奋斗。
    我们相信在毛主席和共产党的领导之下一定能够从胜利的基础上争取更大的胜利的！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    光荣归于中国人民的胜利的组织者——中国共产党！
    光荣归于伟大的人民领袖毛泽东主席！
