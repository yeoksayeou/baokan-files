Xinhua News Agency, October 24th—The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and various democratic parties sent a telegram to Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and all its officers and soldiers, congratulating the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the third anniversary of its entry into Korea to fight. The telegram is as follows:

Commander Peng Dehuai and all commanders, fighters, political workers, logistics workers, and transportation workers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army: On the occasion of the third anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's entry into Korea to fight, we extend our warm congratulations and high respect to you on behalf of the people of the whole country.

For the past three years, thanks to your heroic joint combat with the Korean People's Army on the Korean front and your continuous brilliant victories, you have forced the enemy to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement with us, opening the way for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. This is a great victory for the people of Korea and China, and a great victory for the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the whole world. The people of the whole of China are elated and encouraged by this great victory of historical significance.

However, the American warmongers and the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique are conspiring to undermine the repatriation agreement, obstruct and sabotage the political conference, and further undermine the armistice. Therefore, we must heighten our vigilance, strengthen our preparedness, continue our efforts, further consolidate and develop the fighting friendship between the peoples of Korea and China, and prevent any aggression and provocation from the other side.

Comrades! The people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in China are determined to unite as one, continue to deepen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, develop economic construction, and strengthen national defense to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and continue to struggle for the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and the defense of peace in the Far East and the world.

Eternal glory to the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea!

Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer

    贺志愿军出国作战三周年
    【新华社二十四日讯】中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会和各民主党派致电中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀和全体将士，祝贺中国人民志愿军出国作战三周年，电文如下：彭德怀司令员和中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员、政治工作人员、后勤工作人员、运输工作人员同志们：值此中国人民志愿军出国作战三周年纪念日，我们谨代表全国人民向你们致热烈的祝贺和崇高的敬意。
    三年以来，由于你们在朝鲜前线和朝鲜人民军英勇地并肩作战，不断地取得辉煌的胜利，迫使敌人不得不同我们签订了朝鲜停战协定，为和平解决朝鲜问题打开了道路。这是朝中人民的伟大胜利，是以苏联为首的和平民主阵营和全世界爱好和平的人民的伟大胜利。全中国人民都为这一具有历史意义的伟大胜利而欢欣鼓舞。
    但美国好战分子和南朝鲜李承晚集团却正在阴谋破坏遣俘协议，阻挠和破坏政治会议并进一步破坏停战。因此，我们必须提高警惕，加强戒备，继续努力，进一步巩固和发展朝中两国人民的战斗友谊，防止来自对方的任何侵袭和挑衅行动。
    同志们！全中国各阶层各民族人民决心团结一致，继续深入抗美援朝运动，发展经济建设，加强国防力量，来支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，为彻底实施朝鲜停战协定、和平解决朝鲜问题、保卫远东和平与世界和平而继续奋斗。
    为抗美援朝而牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
