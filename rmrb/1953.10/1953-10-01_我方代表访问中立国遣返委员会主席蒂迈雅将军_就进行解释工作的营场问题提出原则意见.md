Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 30th: On the morning of September 30th at 9:00 AM, representatives of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, General Li Sang-cho and General Ding Guoyu, visited General Timayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, to discuss the specific arrangements for explanation work. General Li Sang-cho pointed out that, given the imminent commencement of explanation work, the drawings of the explanation compound location and its internal design designated by the United Nations Command were submitted too late. At the same time, although the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission agreed to the location and internal design of the explanation compound designated by the Korean and Chinese sides, it is said that some difficulties have been encountered in its execution. Therefore, to ensure that the explanation work can proceed on schedule, our side suggests that necessary and simple explanation compounds should first be constructed at the explanation locations designated by each party. If the United Nations Command does not obstruct, construction will begin immediately at the location designated by our side, with both sides commencing simultaneously, so that the explanation can still begin on schedule on October 1st.

	General Ding Guoyu pointed out that it is a matter of principle that the explaining party designates a location it deems suitable in the custodial area for the construction of an explanation compound. Our side is prepared to immediately carry out construction at the location designated by the United Nations Command. The United Nations Command, using practical difficulties as an excuse, attempts to place the explanation compound for use by our side's explanation representatives in a location close to its military control area, which our side resolutely cannot agree to. The Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, as the executor and arbitrator of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, should safeguard the agreement, abide by the principle of equal treatment for both sides, and demonstrate his impartiality and neutrality on this issue.

	Editor's Note: On September 26th, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission invited representatives from both sides to observe the locations and internal designs of the explanation compounds set up by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for both sides at its two custodial locations. The United Nations Command was dissatisfied with the explanation compound built by our side at the Songgok-ri custodial location for the United Nations Command's explanation representatives. Our side immediately indicated to the Indian side that, based on the principle that the location and design of the explanation compound should respect the requirements of the explaining party, our side is prepared to immediately step up construction completely according to the location and design proposed or agreed to by the United Nations Command, so as to begin the explanation work on October 1st. However, based on the principle of equal treatment for both sides, the United Nations Command must also build an explanation compound for our side's explanation representatives at the location designated by our side, according to the design proposed by our side. The United Nations Command did not transmit the agreed-upon location and drawings of the internal design of the explanation compound to our side through the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission until the afternoon of September 28th, making it impossible to complete this construction project before October 1st. On the other hand, our side had long ago proposed the location and internal design that our side considered suitable for building an explanation compound at the Dongchang-ri custodial location. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission also unanimously agreed at the meeting on the 28th that our side's plan for the explanation compound was reasonable. However, the US side deliberately created difficulties, using certain practical difficulties that could be completely overcome as excuses, and refused to carry out construction in the area designated by our side, insisting on placing the explanation compound used by our side's explanation representatives in a location close to its military control area, making it impossible for the explanation work to begin on October 1st. The responsibility for delaying the explanation work should obviously be borne entirely by the United Nations Command.

	In order to enable the explanation work to begin on schedule, our side has now put forward a reasonable suggestion to first build the necessary simple explanation facilities in the areas designated by each party based on actual possibilities. Whether the explanation work can proceed on schedule depends entirely on whether the US side continues to obstruct it.

### 我方代表访问中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军  就进行解释工作的营场问题提出原则意见

    我方代表访问中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军
    就进行解释工作的营场问题提出原则意见
   【新华社开城三十日电】九月三十日晨九时，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表李相朝将军与丁国钰将军就解释工作的具体安排问题往访中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军。李相朝将军指出：鉴于解释工作即将开始，联合国军方面所指定的解释营场地点及其内部设计的图样交来太迟，同时中立国遣返委员会虽然同意了朝中方面指定的修建解释营场的地点及其内部设计，然而据说在执行中又发现一些困难。因此，为使解释工作得以按期进行，我方建议先在各方指定的解释地点修建必要的简单的解释营场。如果联合国军方面不予阻挠，立即在我方指定的地点进行修建，双方同时动工，十月一日仍可按期开始解释。
    丁国钰将军指出：解释一方在看管地区指定其认为适宜的修建解释营场的地点，是一个原则问题。我方准备在联合国军方面指定的地点立即进行修建。联合国军方面藉口实际困难，企图将供我方解释代表使用的解释营场设在紧靠其军事控制地区的地点，是我方所断然不能同意的。中立国遣返委员会主席作为中立国遣返委员会的执行人与公断人，应该维护协定，遵守双方平等对待的原则，在这一问题上表现出他的公正性与中立性。
    记者按：九月二十六日，中立国遣返委员会曾邀请双方代表观察中立国遣返委员会在其两处看管地点为双方设置的解释营场的地点及其内部设计。联合国军方面不满意我方在松谷里看管地点为联合国军方面的解释代表所修建的解释营场。我方当即向印度方面表示：根据解释营场的地点与设计应尊重解释一方所提要求的原则，我方准备完全根据联合国军方面提出的或同意的地点与设计，立即加紧进行修建，以便在十月一日开始解释工作。但根据双方平等对待的原则，联合国军方面亦必须在我方指定的地点，根据我方提出的设计，为我方的解释代表修建解释营场。联合国军方面直至九月二十八日下午始将其同意的解释营场地点及其内部设计的图样经由中立国遣返委员会转交我方，以致在十月一日以前无法完成此项修建工程。另一方面，我方早就提出我方认为适宜的在东场里看管地点修建解释营场的地点及其内部设计。中立国遣返委员会在二十八日会上也全体一致认为我方对解释营场的方案是合理的。但美方故意刁难，以完全可以克服的某些实际困难作为藉口，拒绝在我方指定地区进行修建，坚持将我方解释代表使用的解释营场设置在紧靠其军事控制地区的地点，以致解释工作无法在十月一日开始。这拖延解释工作的责任，显然应该完全由联合国军方面担负。
    为使解释工作得以按期开始，现在我方又提出先在各方指定地区根据实际可能修建必要的简单的解释场所的合理建议，解释工作能否按期进行，全看美方是否继续阻挠。
