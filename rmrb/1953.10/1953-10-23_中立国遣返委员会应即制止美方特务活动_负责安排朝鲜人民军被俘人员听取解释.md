Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 22nd: The Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission issued the following communique on the 22nd:

    The work of the Korean-Chinese side to explain to its captured personnel their right to return home has been stalled due to sabotage by the US side and its Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents. The explanation work for captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, originally scheduled for four days on the 19th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd, has not yet been able to proceed. Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents, mixed into the POW camps under the guard of the Indian Custodial Forces, under the direct instruction of the US side, are not only doing everything possible to obstruct and sabotage the smooth progress of the explanation work, but are also relying on their special agent organizations and reign of terror to fundamentally prohibit the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army from going to listen to the explanation and apply for repatriation. Syngman Rhee's special agents, posing as "POW representatives," claimed to the Indian Custodial Forces that these POWs were "unwilling to listen to explanations," and that if they were forced to listen to explanations, they would use force to deal with it. At the same time, the US side has repeatedly clamored that the Indian Custodial Forces "must not use force," which is in fact the argument that "no effective measures should be taken against special agents to prevent them from oppressing and persecuting POWs." The Syngman Rhee government even threatened that if the Indian troops used force against the special agents, South Korea would use force to drive out the Indian Custodial Forces, which means that the Indian Custodial Forces can only allow the special agents to use the above inhumane violence to obstruct the POWs from listening to explanations and applying for repatriation, and cannot take the necessary measures to stop the various sabotage activities of the special agents in accordance with the provisions of the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission."
    Although the explanation work has not been carried out for four days, captured personnel of the Korean People's Army have continued to escape from the camps that the special agents said were "unwilling to listen to explanations," risking their lives. They revealed how the US side and the Syngman Rhee government used radio to instruct the special agents not to allow POWs to go to listen to explanations, and how the special agents forced the POWs to lie down in tents in the camps at the designated time for listening to explanations, and threatened to kill anyone who went out to listen to explanations on the spot. This once again thoroughly exposed the US side and its special agents' conspiracy to sabotage the explanation work.
    In order to ensure the implementation of the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," the Korean-Chinese side has repeatedly suggested to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission that it is necessary to completely eliminate the special agent organizations that the US side has long deployed in the captured personnel of the Korean-Chinese side, and to punish the perpetrators who obstruct the repatriation of POWs and kidnap POWs to carry out sabotage activities. In order to assist the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in carrying out this work, the Korean-Chinese side has also submitted to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission a list of some special agents with conclusive evidence. However, to date, the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents have not been eliminated, and the perpetrators and murderers have not been punished. They are standing guard and setting up earth prisons in the POW camps, cutting open chests and digging out the hearts of those who ask to go home; and they dare to openly impersonate "POW representatives" to put forward various absurd conditions to the Indian Custodial Forces and conduct so-called negotiations, trying to turn the POW camps of the Korean-Chinese captured personnel under the guard of the Indian army into a world where Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents run rampant. Under such circumstances, although the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has formulated the basically reasonable "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work" in accordance with the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," the special agents have become so rampant and crazy that the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work" cannot be implemented at all.
    The Korean-Chinese side has repeatedly lodged serious protests with the US side and resolutely demanded that the US side immediately stop these crimes regarding the various crimes of the US side and its Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents sabotaging the custody and explanation, and using force to obstruct the POWs from applying for repatriation. The Korean-Chinese side believes that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces should immediately take effective measures to stop the activities of the special agents, protect the captured personnel of the Korean-Chinese side under its custody, and earnestly fulfill the provisions of the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work," and first of all be responsible for arranging for the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to listen to the explanation in accordance with the explanation plan.

### 中立国遣返委员会应即制止美方特务活动  负责安排朝鲜人民军被俘人员听取解释

    中立国遣返委员会应即制止美方特务活动
    负责安排朝鲜人民军被俘人员听取解释
    【新华社开城二十二日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中代表团二十二日发表公报如下：
    朝中方面向其被俘人员解释他们遣返回家的权利的工作，由于美方及其蒋李特务的破坏而陷于停顿。原定于十九、二十、二十一、二十二日四天对朝鲜人民军被俘人员的解释工作，至今无法进行。混入印度看管部队看管下的战俘营地内的蒋介石与李承晚特务，在美方的直接指使之下，不但百般阻挠与破坏解释工作的顺利进行，而且正凭借其特务组织与恐怖统治，根本禁止朝鲜人民军的被俘人员前往听取解释和申请遣返。李承晚的特务冒充“战俘代表”，向印度看管部队声称：这些战俘都是“不愿听取解释的”，如果一定要他们听取解释，他们将以武力来对付。同时，美方一再叫嚣着印度看管部队“不得使用武力”，实即“不得对特务分子采取任何有效措施，阻止其欺压与迫害战俘”的论调。李承晚政府更扬言如印度部队对特务使用武力，则南朝鲜将用武力把印度看管部队赶出去，这就是说：印度看管部队只能听任特务用以上无人道的暴力，阻挠战俘听取解释和申请遣返，而不能按照停战协定“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定，采取必要的措施来制止特务的种种破坏活动。
    四天来解释工作虽未进行，但却有朝鲜人民军被俘人员，陆续从那些特务说是“不愿听取解释”的营场，冒着生命的危险逃了出来。他们揭发了美方及李承晚政府，怎样用无线电指示特务不许战俘前往听取解释，而特务又如何强迫战俘在指定听取解释的时间，伏在营场内的帐篷里，并扬言谁要出去听解释就当场打死。这就再一次彻底揭穿了美方及其特务破坏解释工作的阴谋。
    为保证“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的实施，朝中方面曾一再向中立国遣返委员会建议，必须彻底清除美方在朝中被俘人员中所长期布置的特务组织，惩办阻挠战俘遣返、挟持战俘进行破坏活动的肇事分子。为协助中立国遣返委员会进行这一工作，朝中方面并已向中立国遣返委员会提出了证据确凿的部分特务名单。但迄今为止，蒋李特务并未清除，肇事分子和杀人凶犯也都未被惩办，他们在战俘营内站岗放哨，设立土牢，把要求回家者剖胸挖心；并敢公然冒充“战俘代表”，向印度看管部队提出种种荒谬条件，并进行所谓谈判；力图把印军看管下朝中被俘人员的战俘营，变成蒋李特务横行霸道的世界。在这种情况下，中立国遣返委员会虽然根据“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”制定了基本上合理的“解释和访问工作细则”，但由于特务已如是嚣张与疯狂，乃使“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”与“解释和访问工作细则”都根本无法实施。
    朝中方面已一再就美方及其蒋李特务破坏看管与解释，并以武力阻挠战俘申请遣返的各种罪行，向美方提出严重抗议并坚决要求美方立即停止这种罪行。朝中方面认为中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队应立即采取有效措施，制止特务活动，保护在它看管下朝中被俘人员切实履行“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”的规定，首先是负责安排朝鲜人民军被俘人员按照解释计划听取解释。
