Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 23rd: Yue Heidan, a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who expressed his desire for repatriation during our side's explanation on the 17th but was unable to be repatriated due to American obstruction, finally returned to Panmunjom today. He told neutral nation personnel and journalists from various countries:

    "Before the explanation work began, I had made up my mind to return home. But special agents threatened me, saying that if I applied for repatriation and was pulled back, I would be beaten to death. They also sent a platoon leader, guards, and others to follow me. They said that as long as I said one sentence in the explanation tent indicating my willingness to be repatriated, they would rush in and beat me to death."

    Yue Heidan, while listening to the explanation in the explanation tent on the 17th, was always worriedly looking behind him, afraid that special agents would rush in. He said: "I decided to wait until these special agents left the explanation site before applying for repatriation. I waited for three hours, until the very end, before loudly saying to the explanation representative, 'I want to return home.' Unexpectedly, I was stopped by the American personnel present, and the Indian chairman did not hear me clearly, so he took me to another place to be held in solitary confinement."

    During his solitary confinement, Yue Heidan requested to return home again, and it has been six days since he was repatriated today.

    Having gotten rid of the terrorist rule of the special agents, Yue Heidan's face showed a pleasant expression. He wore a self-made red five-pointed star and a piece of red cloth on his chest. The fearful expression from six days ago has completely disappeared, and he often smiles at the Korean and Chinese personnel.

    The American "observer representative" who prevented Yue Heidan from expressing his repatriation on the 17th came to Panmunjom today. When Yue Heidan was accusing them, he timidly hid behind the crowd, not daring to show his face.

    The American side was very annoyed by the repatriation of this prisoner of war. According to a United Press report: The so-called "United Nations Command spokesperson" said that the American side will "protest" the neutral nation repatriation committee's repatriation of this prisoner of war, the reason being: "Because the neutral nation repatriation committee did not notify the United Nations Command in advance that it was going to question this prisoner of war. No United Nations Command representative was present to confirm that this prisoner of war had requested to return to the communist side." However, the American side's reason is simply untenable. There is no provision in the "Terms of Reference" or the relevant protocol rules that the neutral nation repatriation committee should notify the American side and have an American representative "confirm" that the prisoner of war's application for repatriation is valid. General Thimayya, chairman of the neutral nation repatriation committee, had already stated in his letter to Clark on October 7th: "This committee cannot agree to allow observers to be present when it takes effect." The real reason for the American side's annoyance and desire to "protest" is that the repatriation of this prisoner of war proves that as long as prisoners of war can get rid of the terrorist control of American special agents and are not threatened by American personnel in the explanation tent, they can exercise their right to be repatriated and dare to express their desire to return home. This once again exposes the American lie that Korean and Chinese prisoners of war "refuse to listen to explanations" and "refuse to be repatriated."

    我方被俘人员一名冲破美方阻挠遣返归来
    再次揭穿美方制造战俘“拒绝遣返”的谎言
    【新华社开城二十三日电】在十七日我方进行解释时表示了遣返愿望但因为美方阻挠而未能遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员岳黑旦，今天终于回到了板门店。他向中立国人员和各国新闻记者说：
    “在解释工作开始以前，我就打定主意要回国了。但特务分子恐吓我说，如果申请遣返，拉回来就要打死。他们还派中队长、警备队员等跟着我。他们说，只要我在解释帐篷里面说一句愿意遣返的话，他们就会冲进来打死我。”
    岳黑旦十七日在解释帐篷中听取解释时，总是担心地瞧着后面，害怕特务分子会冲进来。他说：“我决定等到这些特务分子离开解释场所以后再申请遣返。我等了三个钟头，直到最后才大声向解释代表说‘我要回国’，不料被在场的美方人员阻止，印度主席也没有听清楚我的话，便把我带到另一个地方单独看管起来。”
    在被单独看管期间，岳黑旦又一次要求回国，到今天被遣返归来，已经隔了六天。
    由于摆脱了特务分子的恐怖统治，岳黑旦的脸上流露出愉快的神色。他在胸前佩戴着一个自己做的红五角星和一块红布条。六天以前的恐惧神情已完全消失，他常常向朝中人员微笑。
    十七日那天在解释帐篷中阻止岳黑旦表示遣返的美方“观察代表”，今天曾来到板门店。在岳黑旦控诉的时候，他胆怯地躲在人群后面，不敢露面。
    美方因为这个战俘的遣返而十分恼怒。据合众社报道：所谓“联军发言人”说，美方对于中立国遣返委员会遣返这个战俘的行动，将“提出抗议”，理由据说是：“因为中立国遣返委员会事先没有通知联军要盘问这名战俘。当时没有联军代表在场能证实这名战俘曾要求回共方。”然而，美方的理由根本不能成立的，“职权范围”以及有关协议规则中没有任何一条规定中立国遣返委员会决定战俘的申请遣返有效，应该要通知美方和要美方代表的“证实”，中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军在十月七日致克拉克的信中就已经说明：“本委员会不能同意允许观察人员在生效时出席”。美方的恼怒、要“提出抗议”，其真正原因在于：这个战俘的遣返证明了，只要战俘能够摆脱美方特务的恐怖控制，并不受到在解释帐篷中的美方人员的威胁影响，他们就行使他们的被遣返的权利，敢于表达他们要求回家的愿望。这就使美方所谓朝中战俘“拒绝听取解释”、“拒绝遣返”的谎言，再一次被揭穿了。
