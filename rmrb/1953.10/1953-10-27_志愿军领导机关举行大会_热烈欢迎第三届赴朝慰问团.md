As the entire delegation passed through the enormous rows of people holding flowers to welcome them, slogans, cheers, and applause of "Welcome the Motherland People's慰问团!" "Thank you for the Motherland People's support!" "Resolutely defend the Motherland!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung!" resounded in unison.

At half past ten, a grand welcome meeting was solemnly held in the rain.

He first extended the highest respect and heartfelt gratitude to the great people of the motherland and the great leader Chairman Mao. He said: Dear comrades of the 慰问团: We warmly welcome you and welcome you for bringing us the unparalleled loving care of the great people of the motherland and the great leader Chairman Mao; for bringing the good news of the great achievements made by the motherland in the past three years in restoration work and national construction; for bringing the vivid situation that the people of the motherland are working selflessly to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of our country and the determination of the people of the motherland to continue to deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea and continue to give us great support.
