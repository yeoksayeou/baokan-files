    South Korea's Industry Almost Entirely Collapsed
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang Dispatch: The Korean "Labor News" reported: Under the guise of so-called "strategic measures," the "South Korean Reconstruction Plan," and similar "plans," American imperialism continues to plunder South Korea. All of South Korea's textile, shipbuilding, and other industries have been almost completely destroyed. According to South Korean newspapers, the production volume of South Korea's chemical industry is only 11.8% of pre-war levels, the food industry is 19.7%, and the metallurgical industry is 7.3%. About 70% of American "aid" to Korea is allocated to the restoration and establishment of arsenals and other military facilities. Correction: In the third paragraph, third line of the article "The US Intensifies New Conspiracy to Arm Japan" on page four of this newspaper on October 13, "International Construction Plan" should be "National Defense Construction Plan."

    南朝鲜的工业几乎全部垮台
    据新华社讯：塔斯社平壤讯：朝鲜“劳动新闻”报道：美帝国主义在所谓“战略措施”、“南朝鲜重建计划”以及类似的“计划”的幌子下继续对南朝鲜进行掠夺。南朝鲜的所有纺织业、造船业和其他工业几乎完全被破坏了。据南朝鲜报纸报道，南朝鲜化学工业的生产量只达战前水平的百分之十一点八，食品工业为百分之十九点七，冶金工业为百分之七点三。美国“援助”朝鲜的款项中约有百分之七十是拨作恢复和建立兵工厂及其他军事设施之用的。更正十月十三日本报四版“美国加紧武装日本的新阴谋”文中第三段第三行“国际建设计划”应为“国防建设计划”。
