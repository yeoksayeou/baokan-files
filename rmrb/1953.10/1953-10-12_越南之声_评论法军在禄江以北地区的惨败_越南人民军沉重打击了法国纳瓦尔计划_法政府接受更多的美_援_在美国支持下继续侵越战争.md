Xinhua News Agency, 8th. According to Vietnam News Agency: "Voice of Vietnam" radio station broadcast a commentary on the disastrous defeat of French troops in the recent mopping-up operation north of the Luc River in North Vietnam.

The commentary said: In August, the enemy concentrated fifteen mobile battalions to sweep the area south of Nam Trach, and the People's Army annihilated more than 1,500 of them; then, in early September, more than 500 were killed or wounded in the mopping-up operation in Tien Lang, Kien An province. At this time, the People's Army launched many successful offensives in the Red River Delta, removing the French strongholds of Van Tri, Bi Su, and Le Khe, each time annihilating about two companies of enemy troops.

To retaliate, Navarre concentrated seventeen battalions to launch his largest "mopping-up" operation since arriving in Indochina, north of the Luc River in Hung Yen province. Navarre launched this "mopping-up" operation with the intention of annihilating the People's Army stationed in this area. He was confident that by using so many troops to launch a surprise attack, he could easily achieve victory in a short period of time. However, the French commander-in-chief greatly miscalculated. The ever-vigilant People's Army dealt a heavy blow to the French aggressors: they annihilated more than 600 invading enemy troops in just two days, September 23rd and 24th; and then sank and burned four enemy gunboats on the Luc River. Faced with this situation, Navarre was forced to withdraw some of his troops from the area north of the Luc River. Contrary to Navarre's boasting, Agence France-Presse had to admit that the French army had suffered heavy losses and confirmed that the French army had failed in the mopping-up operation.

While Navarre concentrated a large number of troops in the area north of the Luc River, the People's Army stepped up its activities south of Nam Dinh and defeated three enemy companies in two raids and one ambush.

Thus, in the three days ending September 25th, Navarre lost more than 1,000 soldiers on the battlefronts of Hung Yen province and south of Nam Dinh. In addition, the People's Army destroyed a large number of gunboats, armored vehicles, and weapons and ammunition.

The commentary concluded: The enemy's mopping-up operation north of the Luc River demonstrated the disastrous failure of the enemy's plan to pacify the Red River Delta in North Vietnam, because the enemy was not only unable to eliminate the People's Army, but also suffered heavy losses.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 7th. TASS reported that French bourgeois newspapers are constantly publishing anxious news reports about the intensification of activities by the Vietnamese People's Army. "L'Humanité" wrote: Vietnamese People's Army units are stepping up their attacks on the French Expeditionary Force and the Bao Dai puppet army in Tonkin (i.e., North Vietnam). In recent days, the "situation is serious" at twenty French strongholds in the Red River Delta. Several battalions of the People's Army have penetrated the Bui Chu area, 120 kilometers southeast of Hanoi. Due to the offensive of the Vietnamese People's Army, a battalion of the Bao Dai puppet army in the Bui Chu area suffered "heavy losses."

Xinhua News Agency, 5th. Negotiations between France and the United States regarding the increase of U.S. military "aid" to France for the war of aggression against Vietnam have ended. As a result of the negotiations, the French government accepted more U.S. "aid" and colluded with the United States to continue the war of aggression in Indochina.

According to the joint communique issued by the French and American governments on September 30th, the United States will allocate an additional $385 million this year for the war of aggression against Vietnam, in addition to the $400 million in military aid previously allocated to France. At the same time, the French government, disregarding the French people's demand to end the war of aggression against Vietnam, is "determined to use all its strength" to continue the colonial war that has brought endless disasters to France. To this end, in addition to agreeing to intensify the expansion of the puppet army in Indochina, the French government also promised to quickly transfer nine more battalions of troops from Europe to the war of aggression against Vietnam. Moreover, the French government also guaranteed that while transferring French troops stationed in Europe, France would still maintain its obligations to the expansion and preparation plans of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc.

The joint communique specifically emphasized that France guaranteed to "resolutely implement" the declaration of "independence" to the three puppet regimes in Indochina. This means that U.S. forces will have further convenience to invade Indochina. It is clear that the Washington agreement between France and the United States has strengthened the U.S.'s commanding position on the issue of the Indochina war. When Associated Press news analyst Jay McRoberts revealed on September 26th that the United States would increase its "aid" to the war of aggression against Vietnam, he bluntly said: Although the United States continues to carry out activities related to the aggression against Vietnam through France, due to the United States' increased intervention in the Vietnam War, "the United States has its own new problems and responsibilities." Therefore, "the United States must supervise to ensure that military aid can be effectively utilized, otherwise this aid will only be equivalent to being sent into a rat hole."

    “越南之声”评论法军在禄江以北地区的惨败
    越南人民军沉重打击了法国纳瓦尔计划
    法政府接受更多的美“援”在美国支持下继续侵越战争
    【新华社八日讯】据越南通讯社讯：“越南之声”电台发表广播评论，评论法军最近在北越禄江以北地区的扫荡战中所遭到的惨败。
    评论说：敌军在八月间曾集中了十五个机动营扫荡南宅以南地区，被人民军歼灭了一千五百多人；接着在九月初又在建安省先浪的扫荡战中被杀伤五百多人。在这时候，人民军在红河三角洲地区发动了多次胜利的进攻，拔除了文治、比苏和黎溪的法军据点，每次歼灭敌军两个连上下。
    纳瓦尔为了进行报复，曾集中了十七个营向兴安省的禄江以北地区发动了他到印度支那后的最大一次“扫荡”。纳瓦尔发动这次“扫荡”，原想歼灭驻扎在这一地区的人民军。他满以为使用这样多的部队发动突然的进攻，就可以在短时间内轻易地取得胜利。但是法军总司令大大失算了。经常保持警觉的人民军给法国侵略军以惨重的打击：他们在九月二十三日和二十四日两天就歼灭进犯的敌军六百多人；随后又在禄江上击沉和烧毁敌军汽艇四艘。面临这个局面，纳瓦尔被迫将他的一部分部队撤出禄江以北地区。与纳瓦尔的吹嘘相反，法新社不得不承认法军遭到很大的损失，并确定法军已在扫荡中失败。
    当纳瓦尔把大量部队集中在禄江以北地区时，人民军在南定以南加紧活动，并在两次突袭和一次伏击中打垮敌军三个连。
    这样，到九月二十五日止的三天中，纳瓦尔在兴安省和南定以南的战线上，就损失了一千多名士兵，此外，人民军还击毁了大量汽艇、装甲车和武器弹药。
    评论最后说：敌人在禄江以北的扫荡说明了敌军企图平定北越红河三角洲计划的惨重失败，因为敌人不仅不能够消灭人民军，反而遭到重大损失。
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社巴黎七日讯：法国资产阶级报纸不断发表惶惶不安的消息，报道越南人民军加强活动。“义勇军报”写道：越南人民军部队加紧向东京（即北越）的法国远征军和保大伪军进攻。近几天来，红河三角洲地区的法军二十个据点“情况严重”。数营人民军插入了河内东南一百二十公里的裴朱地区。由于越南人民军的进攻，裴朱地区的保大伪军一个营遭到“惨重的损失”。
    【新华社五日讯】法国和美国之间关于美国增加对法国进行侵略越南战争的军事“援助”的谈判，已经结束。谈判结果是法国政府接受更多的美“援”，和美国勾结在一起，在印度支那把侵略战争继续下去。
    根据法美两国政府在九月三十日发表的联合公报，美国除前次拨给法国的四亿美元军事援助之外，今年将再拨出三亿八千五百万美元的“额外款项”来进行侵越战争。同时，法国政府不顾法国人民的结束侵越战争的要求，“决心用一切力量”来继续给法国带来了无限灾难的殖民战争。为此，法国政府除了同意加紧扩充印度支那的伪军以外，并答应尽快再从欧洲抽调九个营军队投入侵越战争。而且，法国政府还保证：在抽调驻欧法军的同时，法国依然维持它对北大西洋侵略集团的扩军备战计划的义务。
    联合公报特别强调：法国保证要“坚决实行”给印度支那三傀儡政权“独立”的宣言。这就是说，美国势力将会得到进一步侵入印度支那的便利。很明显，法、美间的华盛顿协议加强了美国在印度支那战争问题上的发号施令的地位。美联社新闻分析员杰·麦·罗伯茨在九月二十六日透露美国将增加对侵越战争的“援助”时露骨地说：虽然美国继续通过法国进行有关侵略越南的活动，但是，由于美国加强干涉越南战争，“使美国有了它自己的新的问题和责任”。因此，“美国必须监督使军事援助能够得到有效的利用，否则这种援助便只会等于是送到老鼠洞中”。
