Implement National Policies, Criticize Han Chauvinism

The inspection of the implementation of national policies in various regions across the country, which began in September last year, has concluded victoriously. The results of this inspection prove that the tasks and various national policies stipulated by the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao regarding domestic ethnic issues are completely correct. The implementation of the Central Committee's national policies in most regions has also been fundamentally correct.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party's tasks and basic policies regarding ethnic issues are: to consolidate the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all ethnic groups, to jointly build the great family of the motherland, to guarantee the equality of all ethnic groups in all rights within the unified family of the motherland, to implement ethnic regional autonomy, to closely coordinate with the development of the motherland's construction in the development of the common cause of the motherland, to gradually develop the politics, economy, and culture of all ethnic groups, to eliminate the de facto inequality between ethnic groups historically left over, to help backward ethnic groups advance to the ranks of advanced ethnic groups, and to jointly transition to a socialist society.

In the past three or four years, the Party and the People's Government have gradually implemented the above-mentioned tasks and basic policies, and have done a lot of work. They have established forty-seven ethnic autonomous regions at or above the county level and many ethnic autonomous regions at the district and township levels, enabling about one-third of the minority ethnic population living in concentrated areas to realize the right to "be masters of their own affairs" in managing the internal affairs of their own ethnic groups; they have united leaders from all aspects of minority ethnic groups and cultivated approximately 100,000 minority ethnic cadres; they have carried out land reform in agricultural areas accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total minority ethnic population; they have mediated disputes between and within ethnic groups and stabilized social order in minority ethnic areas; and they have carried out a great deal of economic, cultural, and health work to improve the material and cultural conditions of minority ethnic groups.

All these policies and measures have enabled our country to achieve remarkable and significant accomplishments in resolving ethnic issues, fundamentally changing our country's ethnic relations, especially the relations between fraternal ethnic groups and the Han people, making our country a big family of love and cooperation among all ethnic groups. Within this big family, the fraternal ethnic groups have increasingly strengthened and consolidated their inseparable ties with the Han people, and have increasingly increased their spirit of patriotism and their heartfelt love and support for the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government.

The above-mentioned great achievements that our country has made in resolving ethnic issues are the result of the correct implementation of the Party Central Committee's ethnic policies and the hard work of the relevant Party committees, governments at all levels, and millions of working cadres. However, there are also many errors and shortcomings in the implementation of ethnic policies in various places, some of which are very serious. The most prominent is that some Han cadres still harbor Han chauvinistic ideas or their remnants; some cadres still have the phenomenon of being impatient, or mechanically copying the experiences of Han areas. In addition, there are also some violations of law and discipline among grassroots cadres.

Although ethnic oppression has been fundamentally eliminated and systematic Han chauvinism no longer exists in New China, Han chauvinistic ideas or remnants of Han chauvinistic ideas still exist among some Han cadres and people. After three or four years of education on ethnic policies, this Han chauvinism and remnants of Han chauvinism have been considerably overcome, but they still exist in some areas and among some cadres. Today's Han chauvinistic ideas are mainly manifested in discriminating against minority ethnic groups, not treating them with an equal spirit, and seriously infringing upon the rights of minority ethnic peoples. Although these manifestations are not universal, and some serious phenomena only occur in some areas and have been corrected or are being corrected, they still demonstrate the serious existence of Han chauvinistic ideas.

In this inspection, it was also revealed that narrow nationalism exists to a considerable extent among minority ethnic groups, and that great ethnic chauvinism still exists among some minority ethnic groups that occupy the dominant ethnic position in certain areas.

Both Han chauvinism and various forms of narrow nationalism among minority ethnic groups hinder the cause of unity and cooperation among the people of all ethnic groups in our country, and on a national scale, Han chauvinism has become the main danger in current ethnic relations and ethnic work.

Han chauvinism hinders the true realization of ethnic equality and damages the trust of minority ethnic peoples in the Han people. Precisely because of this, Han chauvinism also hinders the overcoming of various forms of narrow nationalism among minority ethnic groups, and even fuels certain narrow nationalisms. Because the Han people have a large population and occupy an advanced position, while the minority ethnic groups have a small population and are politically, economically, and culturally relatively backward, it is conceivable what adverse effects and consequences Han chauvinism among Han cadres will have on the cause of ethnic unity and among minority ethnic peoples in this contrasting situation. This is also what has been proven by the facts. This is the reason why Han chauvinism is the main danger in current ethnic relations and ethnic work. Han chauvinistic ideology is a manifestation of bourgeois ideology in ethnic relations, and it is incompatible with the internationalist spirit of the working class. Obviously, the bourgeois ideology existing in ethnic relations is detrimental to the cause of our country and people; only by overcoming bourgeois ideology in ethnic relations, first and foremost by overcoming Han chauvinism, can we truly and thoroughly realize ethnic equality and effectively help minority ethnic groups overcome various forms of narrow nationalism. Comrade Stalin said in his report to the "Twelfth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)": "This force (referring to Great Russian chauvinism) is the main danger, and it is enough to destroy the trust of the formerly oppressed nations in the Russian proletariat. This is our most dangerous enemy, and we must overthrow it, because if we overthrow it, then nine-tenths of the nationalism preserved and developing in the various republics will be overthrown." Comrade Stalin's words are of great significance for us to understand and overcome Han chauvinism.

Overcoming Han chauvinism is also conducive to overcoming the subjectivism and violations of law and discipline by Han cadres in ethnic work. Because the subjectivism of Han cadres in ethnic work is closely related to Han chauvinism and is very easy to fall into the quagmire of Han chauvinism; and the bad violations of law and discipline by Han cadres in ethnic work are, in essence, a product of the reactionary style of Han chauvinism in terms of ethnic relations. It can be seen from this that overcoming Han chauvinism has become a central link in correcting ideological work style in current ethnic work.

The Party committees in relevant areas have conducted criticism and correction of Han chauvinistic ideas to varying degrees during the inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies, but it is still necessary to further conduct education combining patriotism and internationalism based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and education on ethnic policies, and to seriously criticize Han chauvinistic ideas among cadres and the masses. This education and criticism should focus on cadres, because only when the ideological viewpoints of cadres are correct can they correctly educate the people.

The struggle against Han chauvinism and its remnants is a long-term ideological education issue, and it is impossible to completely solve the problem in a short period of time. It is certainly wrong and impermissible to let it go unchecked in this regard; however, it is also wrong to adopt hasty and crude methods, which must be prevented. All localities should combine this education and struggle with daily work, steadily and appropriately, and regularly inspect the implementation of ethnic policies, and strictly implement the system of requesting instructions and reporting in ethnic work, in order to solve this problem step by step.

In order to facilitate education on ethnic policies and ethnic unity among the people, all localities should, with reference to the experience of holding army-supporting and people-loving months in the old liberated areas in the past, hold mass rallies and inter-ethnic gatherings on certain dates each year in the relevant areas to focus on conducting education on ethnic policies, inspiring and guiding the Han and minority ethnic groups to focus on reviewing their shortcomings and errors in ethnic relations in a self-critical manner, and properly resolve problems in this regard. At present, some areas naturally hold inter-ethnic gathering activities on certain festivals, which are the sprouts of the above-mentioned methods. The Party committees and governments in relevant areas should pay attention to this, study and improve it, and conduct experiments in some areas first, and then carry it out universally throughout the country after gaining experience.

In the struggle against Han chauvinism, we must also pay attention to protecting the enthusiasm of Han cadres. The vast majority of Han cadres working in minority ethnic areas are diligently serving the people of minority ethnic groups. In the past three or four years, they have done a lot of work, become familiar with the situation in ethnic areas, and established close ties with the local people. Some have also learned ethnic languages. Although some cadres have made some mistakes in their work, they can still work well after correcting their mistakes. The great achievements that our country has made in resolving ethnic issues in recent years are inseparable from the hard work of Han cadres, and it is only natural that they are welcomed by the people of minority ethnic groups. In the struggle against Han chauvinism in various places, it is necessary to be good at distinguishing between comrades with Han chauvinistic ideas and comrades without Han chauvinistic ideas, distinguishing between comrades with serious mistakes and comrades with minor mistakes, and distinguishing between comrades who have made mistakes and can recognize and correct them and comrades who persist in their mistakes. For individual Party members and cadres who have committed serious Han chauvinistic errors, they must, of course, be given appropriate criticism and punishment based on the nature of their errors and the circumstances of their correction, but for those comrades who do not have Han chauvinistic ideas and are diligently serving the people of minority ethnic groups and have achieved results in their work, they should be given appropriate encouragement and praise. Full consideration must be given to the difficulties of Han cadres in their actual work, and it is necessary to prevent the tendency of Han cadres being restricted and afraid to take responsibility in the struggle against Han chauvinistic ideas.

In order to more effectively oppose Han chauvinism and do a good job in ethnic work, we must pay special attention to the quality of cadres when allocating Han cadres to minority ethnic areas. Han cadres sent to minority ethnic areas should be required to play a greater role each, rather than being large in number. In the future, the principle of "rather fewer, but better" should be implemented when sending Han cadres. This is also beneficial to the growth and promotion of minority ethnic cadres. Attention should be paid to strengthening the education of Han cadres who have been sent to minority ethnic areas. To this end, it is necessary to adopt short-term training methods, concentrating on ethnic policy education for ten days or half a month, combined with summarizing work experience. The Party committees in relevant areas should pay attention to carrying out this work and strive to rotate all Han cadres in minority ethnic areas within a certain period of time. At the same time, appropriately improve and raise their material treatment and political and cultural life, encourage and educate them in all aspects to "settle down, take root, blossom, and bear fruit," and Han cadres, especially core cadres, working in minority ethnic areas should not be easily transferred.

Seriously criticizing Han chauvinism can further correctly implement ethnic policies, effectively prevent and overcome narrow nationalism, thereby further strengthening and consolidating ethnic unity. The Party committees and people's governments in relevant areas must make unremitting efforts to overcome Han chauvinism and prevent narrow nationalist tendencies among minority ethnic groups, and further strengthen and consolidate ethnic unity.

### 贯彻民族政策，批判大汉族主义思想

    贯彻民族政策，批判大汉族主义思想
    去年九月间开始的全国各地区民族政策执行情况的检查，已经胜利地结束了。这个检查的结果证明，中共中央、毛主席所规定的党在国内民族问题方面的任务及各项民族政策是完全正确的。大多数地区执行中央的民族政策基本上也是正确的。
    在中华人民共和国成立以后，党在民族问题方面的任务和基本政策是：巩固祖国的统一和各民族的团结，共同来建设伟大祖国的大家庭，在统一的祖国大家庭内，保障各民族在一切权利方面平等，实行民族区域自治，在祖国的共同事业的发展中，与祖国的建设密切配合，逐渐发展各民族的政治、经济和文化，消灭历史上遗留下来的各民族间事实上的不平等，帮助落后的民族提高到先进民族的行列，共同过渡到社会主义社会。
    三、四年以来，党和人民政府逐步地根据上述的任务和基本政策，做了许多工作，建立了四十七个相当于县级及县级以上的民族自治区和许多相当于区级和乡级的民族自治区，使约占少数民族人口三分之一的聚居的少数民族，实现了管理本民族内部事务的“当家作主”的权利；团结了少数民族各方面的领袖人物，培养了十万名左右的少数民族干部；在将近少数民族人口总数三分之二的农业区进行了土地改革；调解了民族间和民族内部的纠纷，安定了少数民族地区的社会秩序；进行了许多改善少数民族物质、文化状况的经济、文化工作和卫生工作。
    所有这些政策措施，已使我国在解决民族问题方面获得了显著的、巨大的成就。从而根本地改变了我国的民族关系，特别是各兄弟民族和汉族的关系，使我们的国家成为各民族友爱合作的大家庭。在这个大家庭内，各兄弟民族日益加强和巩固了和汉族血肉不可分离的关系，日益增涨着爱国主义的精神和对于中国共产党、毛主席、中央人民政府的衷心爱戴和拥护。
    我国在解决民族问题方面所获得的上述的巨大成就，是有关的各级党委、各级人民政府和千万个工作干部正确地执行了党中央的民族政策、艰苦奋斗所得来的。但各地在执行民族政策中所发生的错误和缺点也是很不少的，有些而且是很严重的。比较突出的是若干汉族干部中还存在着大汉族主义思想或其残余；有些干部中还存在急躁冒进，或机械搬运汉族区经验的现象。此外，在基层干部中也还有若干违法乱纪的现象。
    虽然，在新中国，民族压迫已根本消灭，系统的大汉族主义已不存在了，但是大汉族主义思想或大汉族主义残余思想还在一部分汉族干部和人民中存在着。经过三、四年民族政策的教育，这种大汉族主义和大汉族主义残余虽有相当的克服，但在若干地区和若干干部中却仍然存在着。今天的大汉族主义思想，主要表现在歧视少数民族，不以平等的精神相对待，并严重地侵犯少数民族人民的权利。虽然这些表现并不是普遍的，而且其中若干严重的现象仅在若干地区发生，并都已得到纠正或正在纠正中，但由此可见大汉族主义思想的严重存在。
    在这次检查中，也暴露出在少数民族中相当多地存在着狭隘民族主义思想，而在某些地区内占多数民族地位的某些少数民族中也还存在着大民族主义思想。
    大汉族主义和少数民族中各种各式的狭隘民族主义，都妨害着我国各民族人民的团结合作的事业，而在全国范围来说，大汉族主义已成为当前民族关系、民族工作中的主要危险。
    大汉族主义妨害民族平等的真正实现，损害少数民族人民对汉族人民的信任，正因为如此，大汉族主义也妨碍少数民族中各种狭隘民族主义的克服，甚至助长着某些狭隘民族主义。因为汉族人口众多，并居于先进地位，而少数民族人口很少，政治、经济、文化比较落后，在这种对比的情况下，汉族干部中的大汉族主义，将在民族团结事业中，在少数民族人民中产生何等恶劣的影响和后果是可以想见的。事实也这样地证明了。这就是大汉族主义所以为当前民族关系中和民族工作中主要危险的原因。大汉族主义思想是资产阶级思想在民族关系上的表现，它和工人阶级的国际主义精神是不能相容的。显然的，民族关系上存在的资产阶级思想，对于我们国家和人民的事业是不利的；只有克服民族关系中的资产阶级思想，首先是克服大汉族主义，才能真正彻底实现民族平等，并有效地帮助少数民族克服各种狭隘民族主义。斯大林同志在“俄共（布）第十二次代表大会”报告中说：“这个力量
  （按指大俄罗斯爱国排外主义）是个基本的危险，它足以摧毁从前各被压迫民族对俄罗斯无产阶级的信任。这是我们的最危险的一个敌人，我们应当推翻它，因为假使我们推翻了它，那各个共和国内所保存且正在发展着的民族主义有十分之九便推翻了。”斯大林同志的话，对于我们认识和克服大汉族主义是有重要意义的。
    克服大汉族主义，也有利于克服汉族干部在民族工作上的主观主义和违法乱纪行为。因为汉族干部在民族工作上的主观主义和大汉族主义有密切的联系，并且非常容易跌到大汉族主义的泥坑里去；而汉族干部在民族工作中的恶劣的违法乱纪行为，从民族关系上说，实质上也就是大汉族主义的反动作风的产物。由此可见，克服大汉族主义已成为当前民族工作中端正思想作风的中心一环。
    各有关地区的党委，在民族政策执行情况的检查中，对于大汉族主义的思想，已经进行了不同程度的批判和纠正，但还必须进一步在干部和群众中，依据马克思、列宁主义的原则，进行爱国主义和国际主义相结合的教育，进行民族政策的教育，严肃地批判大汉族主义思想。这种教育和批判应该着重在干部中间进行，因为只有干部的思想观点正确了，才能正确地教育人民。
    反对大汉族主义及其残余的斗争是一个长期的思想教育问题，不可能在较短的时间内完全解决问题。在这方面的放任自流，固然是错误的，不能许可的；但采取急躁粗暴的办法也是不对的，是必须防止的。各地应结合日常工作，稳步地、适当地进行这方面的教育和斗争，经常地进行民族政策执行情况的检查，严格地执行民族工作中的请示报告制度，以期一步一步地解决这个问题。
    为了便于向人民进行民族政策和民族团结的教育，各地应参照过去老解放区举行拥军爱民月的经验，在每年的一定日期，在有关的地区，举行群众性的集会和民族间的联欢，集中地进行民族政策的教育，启发和引导汉族和少数民族，用自我批评的方式，双方面着重检讨自己在民族关系上的缺点和错误，并妥善地解决这方面的问题。现在有些地区，在某些节日自然地举行民族间的联欢活动，就是上述方式的萌芽。各有关地区的党委和政府对此应该予以重视，加以研究和提高，并先在若干地区进行试验，待取得经验后，再在全国各地普遍进行。
    在反对大汉族主义的斗争中，也必须注意保护汉族干部的积极性。在少数民族地区工作的汉族干部，绝大多数是勤勤恳恳为少数民族人民服务的。三、四年来，他们做了许多工作，熟悉了民族地区的情况，和当地人民也建立了密切的联系，有些还学会了民族语文。有些干部虽然在工作中犯了若干错误，但在纠正错误之后，仍能很好地工作。几年来我国在解决民族问题方面所获得的巨大成就，是和汉族干部的艰苦努力分不开的，他们能够得到少数民族人民的欢迎也是很自然的。各地在反对大汉族主义的斗争中，必须善于区别有大汉族主义思想的同志和没有大汉族主义思想的同志，区别错误严重的同志和错误轻微的同志，区别犯了错误能认识错误改正错误的同志和坚持错误的同志。对于个别犯有严重的大汉族主义错误的党员、干部，固然必须根据其错误性质和改正错误的情况予以适当的批评和处分，但对于那些并无大汉族主义思想而勤勤恳恳为少数民族人民服务并且工作获有成绩的同志，就应该给以适当的鼓励和表扬。对于汉族干部在实际工作中的困难，必须予以充分的照顾，防止在反对大汉族主义思想的斗争中，使汉族干部束手束脚、不敢负责等偏向发生。
    为了更加有效地反对大汉族主义，作好民族工作，必须在配备少数民族地区的汉族干部时，特别注意干部的质量。派往少数民族地区的汉族干部，应要求他们每个人起更多的作用，而不在于数量多。今后派汉族干部应贯彻“宁肯少些，但要好些”的原则。这样对于少数民族干部的生长和提拔也是有利的。对于已派在少数民族地区的汉族干部，应注意加强教育。为此采取短期轮训办法，以十天或半月的时间，集中进行民族政策的教育，结合总结工作经验是很必要的。各有关地区的党委都应注意进行这一工作，争取在一定的时期内，把在少数民族地区的汉族干部都能轮训一遍。同时适当地改善和提高他们的物质待遇和政治、文化生活，从各方面鼓励、教育他们“安心、生根、开花、结果”，对于在少数民族地区工作的汉族干部，特别是骨干干部不可轻易调动。
    严肃地批判大汉族主义就能够进一步地正确贯彻民族政策，有效地防止和克服狭隘民族主义，从而进一步加强和巩固民族团结。各有关地区的党委和人民政府必须坚持不懈地努力，为克服大汉族主义和防止少数民族中的狭隘民族主义倾向，进一步加强和巩固民族团结而斗争。
