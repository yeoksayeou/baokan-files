Title: U.S. Attempts to Conceal Germ Warfare Crimes are Futile

    In the Korean War, the American aggressors committed the crime of germ warfare against the people of Korea and China. Now, after the Korean armistice, they are attempting once again to use the platform of the Eighth United Nations General Assembly to whitewash this heinous crime against humanity and salvage their utter moral bankruptcy. This attempt is despicable, shameful, and, at the same time, futile.
    The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly discussed on the 26th of this month the so-called "Impartial Investigation of Accusations Regarding the Use of Bacteriological Weapons by United Nations Forces." This issue was forced onto the agenda by the United States. The reason the United States did this, as Soviet Representative Malik solemnly pointed out, was to "defend the US military command before world public opinion and deny the various cruel and inhumane methods of warfare used by the US military in the three-year war of aggression against Korea." But under this cowardly aim, the only trick the United States has pulled out, which it considers clever, is the so-called "oaths" of the ten recently repatriated American airmen, which are full of loopholes. At the same time, the American representative, in his speech, groundlessly denied the American crime of germ warfare and used slanderous words against Korea, China, and the Soviet Union to confuse the facts. These actions, besides exposing the United States' inability to cover up its germ warfare crimes, have no other effect.
    The American crime of conducting germ warfare against Korea and China is an undeniable fact, an open-and-shut case, and absolutely cannot be denied. The people of Korea and China have long obtained irrefutable human and material evidence of the American germ warfare crimes and have made it public to the world; authoritative scientists, jurists, and public leaders of the world have also conducted on-the-spot investigations many times and confirmed these American crimes. The "International Association of Democratic Lawyers Investigation Team," including legal workers from Austria, Italy, Brazil, Britain, France, Belgium, Poland, and other countries, and the "International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of the Facts Concerning Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China," composed of world-renowned scientists from Sweden, France, Britain, Italy, Brazil, the Soviet Union, and other countries, after conducting on-the-spot investigations with an attitude of impartiality, issued objective and scientific reports, unanimously accusing the United States of the shocking crimes it committed. In addition, captured American air force personnel, including senior American air force officers who personally deployed and directed germ warfare under the orders of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, voluntarily confessed the American plan to conduct germ warfare against Korea and China and its implementation during their captivity, feeling ashamed in their hearts. These confessions contain a large amount of accurate information about the time, place, names, positions, instructions, teaching content, and many extremely complex technical processes of the American military's germ warfare. Therefore, the facts they told naturally have a close and irrefutable logical connection. This is absolutely impossible for anyone to say unless they have personally participated in such crimes.
    It is precisely because the facts are so obvious and cannot be quibbled with that the United States has never dared to face these facts. At international conferences such as the United Nations Disarmament Commission and the International Red Cross Conference, the United States has tried its best to obstruct and prohibit the discussion and citation of the facts of American germ warfare; at the United Nations General Assembly, the United States, on the one hand, demanded a so-called "impartial investigation" of the accusations of Korea and China, but on the other hand, refused to allow representatives of Korea and China to attend the conference for a comprehensive and objective discussion and to provide conclusive evidence. The Seventh United Nations General Assembly made a resolution under such extremely unfair circumstances to have people designated by the United States go to Korea and China for a so-called "investigation." This American conspiracy failed due to the resolute opposition of Korea and China. Now, at the Eighth United Nations General Assembly, the American representatives are playing this old trick again, which can only show that these American politicians have "run out of tricks."
    The United States hopes to use the "oaths" of the ten repatriated American airmen as a basis for this sophistry. But these "oaths" are clearly fabricated under the coercion of the American government. Before and after the repatriation of American prisoners of war, responsible officials and newspapers of the American government repeatedly intimidated and threatened American prisoners of war who had made truthful confessions during their captivity. US Attorney General Brownell openly stated at a press conference on August 15 this year:
    "American prisoners of war who cooperated with the Communist authorities in Korea and captured them may be charged with treason"; on September 24, US Secretary of Defense Wilson also said in a special statement: "The nation cannot 'forgive' American prisoners of war for fabricating confessions or betraying their fellow prisoners of war in Communist prisoner-of-war camps." Wilson's statement also mentioned that "some people will be subject to military law." Isn't the implication of Wilson's and others' words of threat and intimidation very clear? Under such circumstances, it is, of course, not surprising that American airmen were forced to overturn their confessions after being repatriated.
    It is precisely because those "oaths" are obviously fabricated under duress that anyone who is willing to examine the facts can see the falsity and extreme absurdity in them at a glance. For example, according to a dispatch from the United Nations by the United Press on the 26th of this month, US Air Force Lieutenant Quinn stated in his "oath" that he was "locked in an icy cave where he could not stand upright for twenty months" during his captivity, "forcing him to make the 'confessions' that the communists wanted." People know that Quinn's confession was written on April 13, 1952. If we go back twenty months, it should be around August 1950. However, according to Quinn's confession during his captivity, he had not only not been captured by the Korean and Chinese sides at that time, but he had not even been sent to Korea to fight, but was teaching at the US Air Force University. There are many ridiculous situations like this in those "oaths." We cannot help but wonder why the American representatives are so careless? They repeatedly said that the American airmen were "mentally deranged" and "mentally distraught" due to the "coercive interrogation" of Korea and China, and made the confessions they made during their captivity. However, those confessions are factually accurate and completely impossible for a "mentally deranged" or "mentally distraught" person to say. On the contrary, the current reversal of facts in these "oaths" put forward by the United States shows that they are "mentally deranged" and "mentally distraught." What is the reason for this? This can only prove that the American airmen were indeed threatened by the US authorities with "treason charges" after being repatriated and were forced to do so.
    American prisoners of war, including those American airmen who made truthful confessions about American germ warfare crimes during their captivity, were treated irreproachably in Korean and Chinese prisoner-of-war camps. US Air Force Colonel Mahurin, in a conversation with Beatrice Beck of the Parisian L'Humanit√© newspaper on September 6 before his repatriation, emphasized that the treatment he had received since his capture was "absolutely unexceptionable." US Marine Corps First Air Wing Ordnance Officer Major Bley, in his confession on January 21, 1953, began by saying: "The facts about germ warfare that I am going to talk about below are written by me voluntarily." The members of the "International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of the Facts Concerning Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China," after meeting with captured American Air Force prisoners of war Quinn, Enock, O'Neil, and Kneis, wrote in their report: "The members of the commission unanimously believed that no physical or mental pressure was applied to these prisoners of war to force them to make statements. They made statements voluntarily." Therefore, the absurd "oaths" made by American airmen under coercion cannot in the slightest detract from the truthfulness of the confessions they made during their captivity. On the contrary, these confessions will continue to be part of the reliable materials proving American germ warfare crimes.
    The United Nations platform is once again being used by the United States as a tool to persecute their own airmen and conduct smear propaganda, which is another disgrace to the United Nations itself. We believe that if the United Nations still respects its solemn responsibilities, there is no reason to tolerate this American wrongdoing. Under the current circumstances, the task of the United Nations General Assembly is to require all those countries that have not yet signed or ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which stipulates the prohibition of bacteriological weapons, to sign or ratify this protocol within the shortest possible time. To this end, the Soviet representative has put forward corresponding proposals at the meeting of the United Nations Political Committee on the 26th of this month, and pointed out that among the six countries that participated but did not ratify the Geneva Protocol, there is also the United States. And it is precisely in order to preserve its freedom to conduct germ warfare everywhere that the United States has consistently refused to ratify this protocol. Obviously, the Soviet proposal is another powerful step in the struggle to prohibit germ warfare. All people in the world who truly care about peace and human security are watching the United Nations and the United States to see what attitude they will show on this issue.
