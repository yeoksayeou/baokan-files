    In the Korean War, the American aggressors committed the crime of germ warfare against the people of Korea and China. Now, after the Korean armistice, they are attempting once again to use the platform of the Eighth United Nations General Assembly to whitewash this heinous crime against humanity and salvage their utter moral bankruptcy. This attempt is despicable, shameful, and, at the same time, futile.
    The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly discussed on the 26th of this month the so-called "Impartial Investigation of Accusations Regarding the Use of Bacteriological Weapons by United Nations Forces." This issue was forced onto the agenda by the United States. The reason the United States did this, as Soviet Representative Malik solemnly pointed out, was to "defend the US military command before world public opinion and deny the various cruel and inhumane methods of warfare used by the US military in the three-year war of aggression against Korea." But under this cowardly aim, the only trick the United States has pulled out, which it considers clever, is the so-called "oaths" of the ten recently repatriated American airmen, which are full of loopholes. At the same time, the American representative, in his speech, groundlessly denied the American crime of germ warfare and used slanderous words against Korea, China, and the Soviet Union to confuse the facts. These actions, besides exposing the United States' inability to cover up its germ warfare crimes, have no other effect.
    The American crime of conducting germ warfare against Korea and China is an undeniable fact, an open-and-shut case, and absolutely cannot be denied. The people of Korea and China have long obtained irrefutable human and material evidence of the American germ warfare crimes and have made it public to the world; authoritative scientists, jurists, and public leaders of the world have also conducted on-the-spot investigations many times and confirmed these American crimes. The "International Association of Democratic Lawyers Investigation Team," including legal workers from Austria, Italy, Brazil, Britain, France, Belgium, Poland, and other countries, and the "International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of the Facts Concerning Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China," composed of world-renowned scientists from Sweden, France, Britain, Italy, Brazil, the Soviet Union, and other countries, after conducting on-the-spot investigations with an attitude of impartiality, issued objective and scientific reports, unanimously accusing the United States of the shocking crimes it committed. In addition, captured American air force personnel, including senior American air force officers who personally deployed and directed germ warfare under the orders of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, voluntarily confessed the American plan to conduct germ warfare against Korea and China and its implementation during their captivity, feeling ashamed in their hearts. These confessions contain a large amount of accurate information about the time, place, names, positions, instructions, teaching content, and many extremely complex technical processes of the American military's germ warfare. Therefore, the facts they told naturally have a close and irrefutable logical connection. This is absolutely impossible for anyone to say unless they have personally participated in such crimes.
    It is precisely because the facts are so obvious and cannot be quibbled with that the United States has never dared to face these facts. At international conferences such as the United Nations Disarmament Commission and the International Red Cross Conference, the United States has tried its best to obstruct and prohibit the discussion and citation of the facts of American germ warfare; at the United Nations General Assembly, the United States, on the one hand, demanded a so-called "impartial investigation" of the accusations of Korea and China, but on the other hand, refused to allow representatives of Korea and China to attend the conference for a comprehensive and objective discussion and to provide conclusive evidence. The Seventh United Nations General Assembly made a resolution under such extremely unfair circumstances to have people designated by the United States go to Korea and China for a so-called "investigation." This American conspiracy failed due to the resolute opposition of Korea and China. Now, at the Eighth United Nations General Assembly, the American representatives are playing this old trick again, which can only show that these American politicians have "run out of tricks."
    The United States hopes to use the "oaths" of the ten repatriated American airmen as a basis for this sophistry. But these "oaths" are clearly fabricated under the coercion of the American government. Before and after the repatriation of American prisoners of war, responsible officials and newspapers of the American government repeatedly intimidated and threatened American prisoners of war who had made truthful confessions during their captivity. US Attorney General Brownell openly stated at a press conference on August 15 this year:
    "American prisoners of war who cooperated with the Communist authorities in Korea and captured them may be charged with treason"; on September 24, US Secretary of Defense Wilson also said in a special statement: "The nation cannot 'forgive' American prisoners of war for fabricating confessions or betraying their fellow prisoners of war in Communist prisoner-of-war camps." Wilson's statement also mentioned that "some people will be subject to military law." Isn't the implication of Wilson's and others' words of threat and intimidation very clear? Under such circumstances, it is, of course, not surprising that American airmen were forced to overturn their confessions after being repatriated.
    It is precisely because those "oaths" are obviously fabricated under duress that anyone who is willing to examine the facts can see the falsity and extreme absurdity in them at a glance. For example, according to a dispatch from the United Nations by the United Press on the 26th of this month, US Air Force Lieutenant Quinn stated in his "oath" that he was "locked in an icy cave where he could not stand upright for twenty months" during his captivity, "forcing him to make the 'confessions' that the communists wanted." People know that Quinn's confession was written on April 13, 1952. If we go back twenty months, it should be around August 1950. However, according to Quinn's confession during his captivity, he had not only not been captured by the Korean and Chinese sides at that time, but he had not even been sent to Korea to fight, but was teaching at the US Air Force University. There are many ridiculous situations like this in those "oaths." We cannot help but wonder why the American representatives are so careless? They repeatedly said that the American airmen were "mentally deranged" and "mentally distraught" due to the "coercive interrogation" of Korea and China, and made the confessions they made during their captivity. However, those confessions are factually accurate and completely impossible for a "mentally deranged" or "mentally distraught" person to say. On the contrary, the current reversal of facts in these "oaths" put forward by the United States shows that they are "mentally deranged" and "mentally distraught." What is the reason for this? This can only prove that the American airmen were indeed threatened by the US authorities with "treason charges" after being repatriated and were forced to do so.
    American prisoners of war, including those American airmen who made truthful confessions about American germ warfare crimes during their captivity, were treated irreproachably in Korean and Chinese prisoner-of-war camps. US Air Force Colonel Mahurin, in a conversation with Beatrice Beck of the Parisian L'Humanité newspaper on September 6 before his repatriation, emphasized that the treatment he had received since his capture was "absolutely unexceptionable." US Marine Corps First Air Wing Ordnance Officer Major Bley, in his confession on January 21, 1953, began by saying: "The facts about germ warfare that I am going to talk about below are written by me voluntarily." The members of the "International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of the Facts Concerning Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China," after meeting with captured American Air Force prisoners of war Quinn, Enock, O'Neil, and Kneis, wrote in their report: "The members of the commission unanimously believed that no physical or mental pressure was applied to these prisoners of war to force them to make statements. They made statements voluntarily." Therefore, the absurd "oaths" made by American airmen under coercion cannot in the slightest detract from the truthfulness of the confessions they made during their captivity. On the contrary, these confessions will continue to be part of the reliable materials proving American germ warfare crimes.
    The United Nations platform is once again being used by the United States as a tool to persecute their own airmen and conduct smear propaganda, which is another disgrace to the United Nations itself. We believe that if the United Nations still respects its solemn responsibilities, there is no reason to tolerate this American wrongdoing. Under the current circumstances, the task of the United Nations General Assembly is to require all those countries that have not yet signed or ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which stipulates the prohibition of bacteriological weapons, to sign or ratify this protocol within the shortest possible time. To this end, the Soviet representative has put forward corresponding proposals at the meeting of the United Nations Political Committee on the 26th of this month, and pointed out that among the six countries that participated but did not ratify the Geneva Protocol, there is also the United States. And it is precisely in order to preserve its freedom to conduct germ warfare everywhere that the United States has consistently refused to ratify this protocol. Obviously, the Soviet proposal is another powerful step in the struggle to prohibit germ warfare. All people in the world who truly care about peace and human security are watching the United Nations and the United States to see what attitude they will show on this issue.

### 美国掩饰细菌战罪行的企图是徒然的

    美国掩饰细菌战罪行的企图是徒然的
    在侵朝战争中曾对朝中两国人民犯下进行细菌战罪行的美国侵略者，现在在朝鲜停战之后，企图再一次利用第八届联合国大会的讲坛，来洗刷这一谋害人类的滔天罪行，来挽救它在道义上的彻底破产。这种企图是卑劣的、可耻的，同时也是徒然的。
    联合国大会政治委员会于本月二十六日讨论了所谓“公正调查关于联合国军队使用细菌武器的控诉”。这个问题是美国强使大会列入议程的。美国所以要这样做，正如苏联代表马立克所严正指出的，是为了“要在世界舆论面前为美军司令部辩护，否认美国军队在三年的侵朝战争中所使用的各种残酷的、灭绝人性的战争方法”。但在这个卑怯的目的下，美国所搬出来的自以为得意的法宝，却只是最近被遣返的十个美国飞行人员的破绽百出的所谓“誓言”。同时，美国代表在发言中，毫无根据地否认美国进行细菌战的罪行，并以对朝中两国及苏联的污蔑之词来混淆事实。这些除了暴露美国对它的细菌战罪行无法掩盖之外，是毫无其他作用的。
    美国对朝中两国进行细菌战的罪行已是铁案如山，绝对抵赖不掉。朝中两国人民早已获得了美国细菌战罪行的无可辩驳的人证和物证，并已公之于世；世界权威的科学家、法学家和社会公众领袖也早已多次进行过实地调查，并证实了美国的这种罪行。包括奥地利、意大利、巴西、英国、法国、比利时、波兰等国的法律工作者在内的“国际民主法律工作者协会调查团”，和由瑞典、法国、英国、意大利、巴西、苏联等国闻名世界的科学家组成的“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”，在以公正的态度进行实地调查后，发表了客观的、科学的报告，一致指控了美国所犯的惊人罪行。此外，被俘的美国空军人员，包括根据美国参谋长联席会议的命令亲自部署与指挥细菌战的美国空军高级军官在内，在被俘期间由于内心感到羞惭，而自愿地供认了美国对朝中两国进行细菌战的计划及其实施情形。这些供词，都有着大量准确的有关美军进行细菌战的时间、地点、人名、职别、训令、讲授内容和许多极复杂的技术过程，因而他们所讲述的事实也就自然有严密的、不容挑剔的逻辑的连系。这除非亲身参预过这种罪行的人，是绝对不可能说出的。
    正是因为事实如此昭著而不容狡辩，所以美国也从来就不敢面对这些事实。在联合国裁军委员会及国际红十字大会等国际性的会议上，美国曾极力阻挠和禁止讨论并引证美国进行细菌战的事实；在联合国大会上，美国一面要求对朝中两国的控诉进行所谓“公正调查”，但一面又拒绝朝中代表出席大会作全面、客观的讨论，并提供确定不移的证件。第七届联合国大会就是在这种极不公正的情况下，作出了要由美国所指定的人到朝中两国进行所谓
    “调查”的决议。美国的这个阴谋诡计，由于朝中两国的坚决反对而失败了。现在，在第八届联合国大会上美国代表又来玩这个老阴谋，这只能说明这些美国政客已是“黔驴技穷”了。
    美国希望以被遣返的十个美国飞行人员的“誓言”作为进行这次狡辩的本钱。但是这些“誓言”，明显地是在美国政府的威逼下捏造出来的。早在美国战俘被遣返之前和遣返之后，美国政府的负责官员和报纸就曾一再对在被俘期间作了忠实口供的美国战俘进行恐吓和威胁。美国司法部长布朗纳尔在今年八月十五日的一次记者招待会上曾公开声明：
    “在朝鲜和俘掳他们的共产党当局合作的美国战俘可能要被控为叛国的罪名”；九月二十四日，美国国防部长威尔逊在一篇特别声明中也说：“国家不能‘宽恕’美国战俘捏造口供或在共产党战俘营中告密危害他们的战俘同伴的行为”。威尔逊的这篇声明中还说到“有些人要受到军法制裁”。威尔逊等人这种威胁恐吓之词的言外之意难道不是非常明白吗？在这种情况下，美国飞行人员在被遣返之后，被迫推翻自己所作过的口供，这当然是毫不令人奇怪的。
    正是由于那些“誓言”是显然被迫捏造的，因而，任何肯于考察事实的人便可以一眼看出其中的虚假和极端的荒谬之处。譬如，据合众社本月二十六日自联合国所发出的电讯的报道，美国空军中尉奎恩在他的“誓言”中陈述说，他在被俘期间曾“在一间无法直立的冰冷的洞穴里关了二十个月”，
    “迫使他向共方作了他们所希望的‘招供’”。人们知道，奎恩的供词是在一九五二年四月十三日写出的，如果倒退二十个月的话，那应该是一九五○年八月间。但是，根据奎恩在被俘期间所作的供词，那时他不但还没有被朝中方面俘获，而且也还没有被派到朝鲜作战，而是在美国的空军大学里教书。那些“誓言”中像这种可笑的情形还有许多。我们不能不好奇地要问一问美国的代表先生们，他们为什么竟这样粗心大意呢？他们一再说美国的飞行人员由于朝中的“逼供”而“神志失常”、“精神恍惚”，作出了在被俘期间所作的供词。但是，那些供词却都事实精确，完全不可能是一个“神志失常”、“精神恍惚”的人所能说出来的。相反的，现在美国所提出的这几个“誓言”的颠倒事实，反而表现出他们是“神志失常”、“精神恍惚”了。这是什么缘故呢？这只能证明，美国飞行人员在被遣返之后确实是受到美国当局以“叛国罪名”相威胁，而被逼如此的。
    美国战俘，包括那些在被俘期间对美国细菌战罪行作了忠实招供的美国飞行人员在内，他们在朝中战俘营中所受到的待遇是无可非议的。美国空军上校马胡林在他被遣返之前，于九月六日对巴黎人道报记者贝却敌发表的谈话中曾强调说，他在被俘以来所受到的待遇是“绝对无可抱怨的”。美国海军陆战队第一空军联队军械官少校布莱，在他于一九五三年一月二十一日所作的供词中，开头就说：“我下面谈到的关于细菌战的事实，是我自愿写出的。”“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”的委员们，在会到被俘中的美国空军战俘奎恩、伊纳克、奥尼尔、克尼斯之后，在他们报告书中写道：“委员会的委员们不约而同地认为对这几个战俘并没有施用肉体和精神上的压力，强迫他们发表声明。他们发表声明，都是出于自愿的。”因此，美国飞行人员在被威逼的情形下作出的荒谬的“誓言”，丝毫也不能有损他们在被俘期间所作的供词的真实性。相反的，这些供词将继续是证明美国细菌战罪行的可靠材料的一部分。
    联合国的讲坛再一次被美国利用为迫害他们自己的飞行人员，进行污蔑宣传的工具，这是联合国本身的又一个耻辱。我们认为：联合国如果还尊重它的庄严的职责的话，就没有任何理由容忍美国的这种胡作非为。在目前的情况下，联合国大会的任务是要求所有那些还没有在规定禁用细菌武器的一九二五年的日内瓦议定书上签字或没有批准这个议定书的国家，在尽可能的短时期内在这个议定书上签字或批准这个议定书。为此，苏联代表已在本月二十六日联合国政治委员会的会议上提出了相应的建议，并且指出在那些参加而没有批准日内瓦议定书的六个国家中，也有美国。而美国也就是为了保留它到处进行细菌战的自由，自始至终拒绝对这个议定书加以批准的。显然，苏联的这个建议，是为禁用细菌武器而坚持斗争的又一有力步骤。全世界真正关心和平与人类安全的人们，都在注视着联合国和美国，看它们在这个问题上究竟将会表现出怎样的态度。
