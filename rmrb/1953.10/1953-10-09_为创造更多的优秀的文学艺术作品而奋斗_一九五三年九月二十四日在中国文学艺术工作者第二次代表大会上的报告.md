Since the convening of the First National Congress of Literary and Art Workers in 1949, four years have passed. During this period, our country has undergone unprecedented and earth-shaking changes. Due to the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, for the first time in Chinese history, a state of the people has been established, land reform and other democratic reforms have been completed, the national economy has been restored and developed, and through the resolute struggle of aiding Korea and resisting America, the country has been defended and world peace has been maintained. Now our country has entered a period of large-scale, planned economic construction, and is steadily and firmly carrying out the great cause of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation.

The laboring people have become the masters of the state; with the improvement of their material living conditions, they need a new spiritual life. To satisfy the growing cultural needs of the masses, to create excellent and true literary and artistic works, to educate the people with the sublime thoughts of patriotism and socialism, and to inspire the people to advance towards a socialist society, this is the solemn task in the field of literary and artistic work.

Over the past four years, following the direction indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, our literary and artistic activities have advanced together with the progress of the entire people's cause.

New people's literature and art have basically replaced the old, decadent, and backward literature and art of the feudal and bourgeois classes. They have occupied positions in the broadest areas of contact with the masses and are continuing to expand their positions. American films full of reactionary and decadent ideas and vulgar tastes that once dominated the Chinese film market have long been rejected by the people; the broad audience has expressed the most enthusiastic love for films produced by state film studios and highly ideological and artistic films from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. Traditional national operas have undergone initial reforms in content and stage imagery and have created some new excellent plays; these new, reformed operas, along with new spoken dramas and operas, have been welcomed by more audiences. New literary works, including translated Soviet literary works, have increased in sales by ten to twenty times compared to before liberation. New picture books, New Year pictures, new songs, and dances have all gained wide circulation among the masses. All the excellent artistic works created by writers and artists have been quickly accepted by the broad masses and have become their common spiritual nourishment; at the same time, the masses have actively participated in artistic creation through various amateur activities; our art is constantly being supplemented and enriched by the masses' creations. All of this has improved and enriched the cultural life of the people and has further strengthened the close connection between literature and art and the masses.

Our writers and artists have striven to portray the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers in their creations, portraying their new appearances and new qualities. The victory of the Chinese revolution, social reforms, and the extensive political education and ideological transformation of the people have not only changed the social and economic face of the country but have also changed the moral and spiritual face of the people. The heightened political awareness and labor enthusiasm of the people, as well as the growth of their new qualities, are the most important and precious achievements of our revolution; this is also what our artistic creations need to reflect first.

Our writers are more familiar with the life and characters of the revolutionary war period, which they have personally experienced for a long time. Works published over the past four years, such as the novels "Iron Wall" by Liu Qing, "Fiery Plains" by Xu Guangyao, "Living Pond" by Chen Dengke, "Fire in Front" by Liu Baiyu, "Unwithering Flowers" by Ma Jia, and the plays "Growing in Battle" by Hu Ke, as well as films like "White-Haired Girl," "Iron Soldiers," "North and South Campaigns," "Concentration Camp in Shangrao," and "Red Flag on Jade Hill," have all realistically depicted some heroic figures from the domestic revolutionary war and the War of Resistance Against Japan. These heroes are the embodiments of the indomitable fighting will of the people in those arduous years. Our writers have begun to write some works depicting the great struggle of aiding Korea and resisting America. Wei Wei's famous collection of reports "Who Is the Most Beloved Person" has aroused the most enthusiastic response from a wide readership. Yang Xiao's novel "Three Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains" and Lu Zhuguang's "Battle of Triangle Hill," as well as other short stories depicting the Korean War, although still immature, have to some extent depicted the high patriotism and internationalism of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and their heroic qualities and images. Ba Jin's works about the Korean battlefield, with all his enthusiasm, have sung the praises of the true heroes of our time.

Our writers have attempted to portray the theme of industrial workers' production labor and class struggle, depicting the images of industrial leaders and model workers; dramas like "Facing New Things" by Du Yin and others, "Forty Years of Aspirations" by Li Qingsheng and others, and the novel "For a Happy Tomorrow" by Bai Lang are attempts in this regard. After "Dragon's Mouth Alley," Lao She's new work "Spring and Autumn Fruits" strives to portray the great "Five Anti" struggle of the working class against the illegal actions of the bourgeoisie. In works depicting the new life in the countryside, the theme of marriage and family problems occupies a prominent position. Young men and women have taken a completely new attitude towards marriage, different from the past. They not only bravely fight for marital freedom but also consciously place public interests above personal happiness. The liberation of women and the overall social reform are inseparable, and it is in the fierce social struggle that the new independent and courageous character of women has been cultivated and tempered, which is vividly reflected in many literary and dramatic works.

The theme of praising the great motherland and defending world peace has been strongly and vividly expressed in some excellent poems, music, and art works.

A notable phenomenon in the literary and artistic field is the continuous emergence of new writers from the workers and peasants, such as Gao Yubao, who is well known. At the same time, new authors from ethnic minorities have begun to appear. With the spirit of fraternity among the various ethnic groups in the country, they have truthfully depicted the new and old scenes of the lives of ethnic minorities and created the images of advanced elements among the ethnic minorities. Their works mark the new development of literature among the various ethnic minorities in the country.

While promoting new literary and artistic creation, we have reformed and developed the various national arts that still exist among the people, so that all valuable things in the artistic heritage can be fully utilized by the people to build their new cultural life. New literature and art cannot develop without national traditions; only when it correctly absorbs the essence of its own national heritage can it truly become the people's. On the other hand, old heritage can only fully meet the needs of the people after being sorted out on a new ideological basis. The people cherish their excellent national operas, but with the improvement of their political, cultural level, and aesthetic tastes, they cannot accept some negative and harmful content in the old operas, nor can they tolerate vulgar and obscene performances that defame and humiliate laboring people on stage. They demand the reform of operas. Over the past few years, new, reformed excellent plays, such as "The Butterfly Lovers" and "The Harmony Between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor," have been particularly welcomed by the masses. Local operas have also created some successful experiences in portraying modern life themes. In the work of opera reform, we have emphasized the criticism of the rough attitude towards heritage, as well as the criticism of the conservative idea of adhering to old rules and not seeking improvement.

Many opera and folk art performers have made efforts in the reform of opera and folk art. The importance they have received in the new society from the state and the people, the deep impressions and enlightenment they have received from contact with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as the ideological tempering and education they have received from participating in various social and political activities, have greatly enhanced their patriotic political enthusiasm and creative initiative. However, some comrades engaged in opera reform work often fail to see the progress of the performers, do not rely on the performers' creativity and initiative in their work, do not respect their skills and experience, but instead act arbitrarily based on their own enthusiasm or administrative orders. This rough attitude has caused some losses to the opera reform work.

The national opera performances and folk music and dance performances held last year and this year have played a major role in promoting the reform and development of national opera, music, and dance. Folk music and dance from various ethnic minorities have provided the richest source for the creation of new music and dance art. Only by widely collecting, sorting out, and processing folk music and dance can we find the correct path for the development of music and dance art. Things created out of thin air, without a folk foundation, will not be welcomed by the masses.

The popularity of new New Year pictures and picture books is precisely because they have adopted folk forms, and these forms and new content are gradually and appropriately merging. But we have not given due attention and systematic research to the entire heritage of national painting, sculpture, and architectural art. National painters are beginning to explore how to improve and develop the forms of classical Chinese painting art to suit new creative tasks. This is very necessary. Without solving this task, the excellent traditions of national painting cannot continue to develop. Obviously, the masses hope to see in paintings the images of contemporary characters first, rather than those ancient beauties in distant past; the masses love to see beautiful flowers, insects, birds, and landscapes in daily life, but cannot appreciate the mood of a recluse who avoids the world and has no worldly concerns. All artists who do not want to fall behind the times must understand and strive to adapt to the needs and preferences of the masses.

Overall, new literary and artistic creation is still weak. The masses feel that there are too few new literary and artistic works, especially films and theatrical works. The people have the full right to demand that literary and artistic workers produce more and better works than they do now. Because the people have grown rapidly in politics and culture, their demands and tastes for art have also rapidly improved, they not only demand that new literary and artistic creation have sufficient supply to meet their needs but also demand that these works meet their level of demand. Young people, in particular, sharply feel the lack of works with the high inspirational and educational power like those of the Soviet Union. The life of our country is so rich and full, so full of dramatic changes, but the pictures of life depicted in our works often seem monotonous and dull. So many heroes with new, noble spiritual qualities loyal to the country and the people's cause have emerged among our people, but our works are particularly lacking in vivid images of such heroes, and people are so eager to see such images in works and take them as their own learning examples!

It is undeniable that our literary and artistic undertakings, compared with the entire people and the state's undertakings, and compared with the needs of the people, are far behind.

When we review the development of literature and art over the past four years, we can see that this development was not smooth sailing but experienced fierce ideological struggles. Literature and art are a form of social ideology and cannot but reflect the different interests and thoughts of various classes. Although in literature and art, the bourgeoisie in our country has made no significant contributions or positions; this does not mean that our literature and art do not frequently suffer from the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, especially since the working class is in the period of cooperating with the bourgeoisie, the danger of such infiltration should be more alerted.

When the War of Liberation was nearing victory and we were about to move from the countryside to the cities, there was already a doubt among some literary and artistic workers: "Can the literature and art of the liberated areas be popular in the cities?" This actually reflected the wavering of the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. History has proved the opposite: the literature and art of the liberated areas, which represent the new era of the masses, were immediately enthusiastically welcomed by workers and urban laboring people and progressive intellectuals. Naturally, we also heard some such arguments, saying that the literature and art of the liberated areas are "peasant literature and art," saying that these works lack "humanity" and "mood." Those who said these words actually looked down on the literature and art for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Their opinions do not represent the masses.

Our literature and art must always reflect the thoughts and feelings of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, especially the thoughts and feelings of the advanced elements among the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This means to sing the praises of their indomitable fighting will, selfless labor enthusiasm, and to praise their unlimited loyalty to the collective, the country, and the people's interests, so as to cultivate the new qualities and new morality of the people and help the people push history forward. On the contrary, bourgeois literature and art always stubbornly reflect itself, propagandize individualism, personality cult, self-admiration, and instill the idea of indifference to the fate of the country and the people and aversion to the struggles of the masses, so as to strive to consolidate people's old thoughts, habits, and prejudices and pull history backward. The film "Wu Xun" is extremely harmful precisely because it cleverly propagandizes the idea of surrendering to the reactionary feudal rulers and propagandizes bourgeois reformism and individualism; the personal austerity praised in the film is only a perverted and deformed manifestation of individualism. The film "Wu Xun" is precisely to give these poisonous ideas an artistic form, making the vast audience and many literary and artistic workers, including some Party members, fall into confusion. The seriousness of the problem lies here. The criticism of the film "Wu Xun" initiated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao in 1951 timely and forcefully struck back at the infiltration of bourgeois ideology in the field of literature and art, and at the same time gave our literary and artistic workers, especially Party literary and artistic workers, a profound and unforgettable education. This criticism movement and the subsequent rectification study in the literary and artistic circles, as well as the active participation in the "Three Anti" and "Five Anti" struggles against the infiltration and illegal actions of bourgeois ideology, greatly helped literary and artistic workers to draw clear ideological lines between the working class and the bourgeoisie in their minds. The criticism of "Wu Xun" is a major victory of the working class on the ideological front, which has further consolidated the leading position of the working class ideology in the field of literature and art.

The rectification study in the literary and artistic circles has promoted more writers and artists to go to factories, villages, and the Korean front to deeply experience life. This has opened up a broad path for literary and artistic creation to be more closely combined with the struggles of the broad masses.

On the literary and artistic front, we must continue to criticize the various manifestations of bourgeois ideology; for example, blindly admiring Western bourgeois culture and despising one's own national traditions is a typical manifestation of bourgeois ideology, and this idea must be criticized. The struggle against bourgeois ideology is one of our long-term tasks. At the same time, we must also oppose the tendencies of conceptualization, formulaic writing, and other anti-realism in literary and artistic creation; if we do not overcome these tendencies, our literature and art cannot advance. The struggle for realism in literature and art is also one of our long-term tasks.

Our literature and art are basically realistic. Our literary and artistic works reflect the lives and struggles of the workers, peasants, and soldiers as the creators of history, reflect the sharp problems in real life, and closely follow the current political tasks. For this reason, many works have played an active educational role for the people and made beneficial contributions to the various struggles and state construction of the people. The basic realistic tendency in our literature and art is not to be ignored or eliminated. However, on the other hand, our literary works have not yet been able to comprehensively and summarize the rich experiences accumulated by the Chinese people in their long struggles in art, nor have they been able to create outstanding positive character types. Many works are still prone to the shortcomings of conceptualization and formulaic writing, which shows the weak side of realism in our literature and art. Subjectivism in creation is seriously present. Some writers, when creating, do not start from life but from concepts. These concepts are mostly derived from written policies, instructions, and decisions, and have not been obtained through the writer's personal experience, observation, and research of the lives of the masses, and thus have not become the writer's true source of inspiration and the basis for creation. These writers do not strictly follow the development laws of life itself but subjectively describe life according to pre-set formulas. However, for most writers, this subjectivism is not conscious. They have participated in the actual lives and struggles of the masses and have also tried to describe life truthfully, but because they have not deeply and comprehensively understood life, and some writers, especially young writers, have not yet fully mastered the methods and techniques of expressing life, this has formed the most universal and main cause of the production of conceptualization and formulaic writing. To overcome the tendency of conceptualization and formulaic writing in creation, the key is to improve the writers' ability to understand and express life. Now many writers have gone deep into the lives of the masses, and they have further realized that writers must establish a real and close connection with the masses from struggles, production, and work, and at the same time must learn to use the perspective of Marxism-Leninism theory and the policies of the Party and the state to examine, estimate, and study life, so as to avoid getting lost in the vast sea of life.

The reason why the tendency of conceptualization and formulaic writing in literary and artistic creation is not easy to overcome is also due to the influence of a vulgarized and simplified idea of subordinating art to politics.

The fundamental characteristic that distinguishes literature and art from other ideological forms is the use of images to express thoughts. Without images, there is no art, and images can only be drawn from life. Some of our literary and artistic leaders and many writers often do not understand this fundamental characteristic of art. They pursue abstract political nature away from the authenticity of artistic images, do not require the creation of characters with typicality, life, and personality in the works, but only require the characters in the works to be simple mouthpieces of certain thoughts; as a result, the characters are not people who act and develop naturally and lawfully in a certain environment, but puppets manipulated by the author at will; thoughts are not permeated in the artistic organization of the works, but are only some abstract arguments added to the works. The need for characters in the works is only to use them to explain various specific policies, rather than to infect and move the readers through the true images of characters with noble qualities, thoughts, and emotions. Marx and Engels have long reminded writers not to forget Shakespeare for Schiller, not to forget the realistic elements for the ideological elements. Lenin and Stalin repeatedly emphasized that writers must be faithful to life. Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" also specially emphasized that writers must deeply observe, experience, and study the lives of the people, and he required the complete unity of the political nature and authenticity of literature and art.

Of course, literary works should reflect the policies of the Party. Literary creation without the policies of the Party and the state is to be without the leadership of the Party and the state. Policies are formulated based on the objective laws of social development and are the concentrated reflection and representation of the fundamental interests of the people. When observing and describing life, writers must take the policies of the Party and the state as their guide. They must estimate any phenomenon in social life from the perspective of policies. Writers must reflect the great power of policies in the lives of the masses. Our policies are always implemented by relying on the masses and cadres. Once policies are grasped by millions of masses, they change and guide the lives of the people with irresistible force, determining the fate of the entire country and the people. Therefore, in artistic works, reflecting policies is fundamentally to reflect the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Party and the people and the leadership of the Party over the masses, to reflect the struggle between the advanced and backward forces among the people, to reflect the exemplary role of the Communist Party members as the vanguard, and to reflect the superiority of the people's democratic system. Therefore, correctly reflecting policies and truthfully describing life must be completely unified. The authenticity of life description is the highest principle of realistic art.

Literary works must describe characters and describe people's thoughts and emotions. Only through characters can class struggles and production struggles be reflected. Therefore, some literary works that describe production do not sing the praises of labor and the fighting and creative spirit of laborers but simply depict the technical processes of production, operating methods, and even the movements of machines (as depicted in some dances), which not only violate the requirements of art but also lack political and ideological content.

New literature and art, in general, are still relatively young and are in the process of growth. They face many difficulties. The main responsibility of the leadership in literary and artistic work should be to do everything possible to help them grow healthily, support their every new step of progress, and patiently help them overcome shortcomings and difficulties. The young and new literary and artistic undertaking is in great need of correct, specific, and detailed leadership.

Now let's look at the current situation of our literary and artistic leadership work. It must be said that it is far from satisfactory. This is precisely the serious cause of the current backwardness in literary and artistic work.

In his famous article "The Party's Organization and Party Literature" written in 1905, Lenin pointed out: "Literary work must definitely become an inseparable part of the work of the Social Democrats, just as other parts are." But he also pointed out that this part should not be treated in the same rigid way as other parts, "Literary work does not allow mechanical averaging, uniformity, and the minority submitting to the majority," "In this work, it is necessary to unconditionally guarantee the creativity of individuals, their interests, and broad scope for activities, as well as broad scope for thinking, imagination, form, and content." This means that literary and artistic activities must be led by the Party and the state, which is an unshakable and unchanging principle; but such leadership must also pay great attention to the characteristics of literary and artistic activities.

In our work, we often violate Lenin's principles. On the one hand, we have not always regarded literary and artistic work as an inseparable part of the Party's entire work, and have not helped writers seriously study the policies of the Party and the state and actively participate in the actual struggles of the masses, resulting in the phenomenon of detachment from politics and reality in literary and artistic work; on the other hand, we often ignore the laws of literary and artistic activities and show a rough attitude in guiding literary and artistic activities.

We are more accustomed to adopting simple administrative methods and are not good at using social methods to lead artistic creation activities. Some literary and artistic work leadership agencies, when assigning creation tasks, often do not consider the different life experiences and writing abilities of individual writers but arbitrarily assign topics, deadlines for completing creation, and even forms of creation, as if they were dealing with elementary school students. When the works are completed, they often simply and rashly deny them, do not take the success or failure of a work as an important matter, and therefore rarely seriously study and summarize the experiences of such success or failure to concretely help writers. This administrative-style leadership method for creation is a manifestation of leadership without ideas and politics, and at the same time, it also fosters the erroneous tendency of conceptualization and formulaic writing in creation. Literary and artistic creation activities are more suitable to be promoted by social methods. We should rely more on the organizations of writers and artists themselves to organize their creations, mobilize more writers and artists to compete freely in creation, mobilize their correct criticism and self-criticism among themselves, and mobilize correct public opinion to promote and guide creation; only in this way can we create a favorable atmosphere for the development of creation and create the most favorable conditions for the artistic labor of writers. These are the aspects we have neglected in the past. Of course, doing so is not to weaken the leadership of the Party and the government over literary and artistic undertakings but precisely to better realize such leadership.

Literary criticism is one of the main methods to promote and guide literary and artistic creation. Since the criticism of the film "Wu Xun," we have conducted sharp criticism of the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideological tendencies in literary creation and the phenomena of shoddy and irresponsible creation. This is completely necessary. Without such criticism, our literature and art would fall into stagnation or go astray. Over the past two or three years, our literary criticism work has been effective. There is a fear and hatred of criticism among some literary and artistic workers, which cannot be considered normal. However, some biases have occurred in our criticism work and should be corrected. First of all, we must point out the attitude of criticism. Some critics often do not distinguish between works with an overall anti-people tendency and works with defects or even errors but with an overall progressive tendency, and do not distinguish between the deliberate distortion of life by writers and the unrealistic description of life due to the writers' insufficient understanding or insufficient expression techniques, and adopt an expository and attacking attitude in criticism. Any defects and errors should be criticized, but as long as it is not an anti-people work, its correct aspects must be affirmed first, then its defects and errors must be criticized, and the ways to correct them must be actively pointed out. Critics lack the necessary comradely concern for writers, and do not correctly combine serious criticism with enthusiastic encouragement, strict requirements for writers with concern for their creative fate. Criticism is generally more accusatory and less helpful. Secondly, there is the method of criticism. Some critics, when criticizing a work, often do not start from reality but from dogmatic formulas. They often arbitrarily and vaguely accuse a work of not describing this correctly and not describing that correctly, but rarely point out exactly how to describe it correctly. Critics often lack basic knowledge and deep understanding of life, and at the same time lack the ability to analyze works concretely and artistically.

The rough and arbitrary criticisms published in newspapers and the extreme views of some readers influenced by such criticisms, coupled with the lack of concern, help, and support from the leadership of the literary and artistic circles for the literary and artistic creation undertaking, have made many writers feel spiritually oppressed and distressed. This mood needs to be changed. Our criticism must help to encourage the creativity and initiative of writers and artists, develop the potential of artistic creation, and cannot be the opposite. At the same time, our writers must have the courage and magnanimity to listen to criticism, even incorrect criticism, and actively and voluntarily participate in critical activities as writers. Our literary criticism, just like creation, is young; it also needs support and nurturing. Obviously, the current criticism work must be strengthened and cannot be weakened in the slightest. Correcting the biases in criticism work and developing correct criticism that is beneficial to the creation undertaking is a common task for writers and critics.

The errors and shortcomings in literary and artistic work mentioned above are inseparable from the work situation of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and various associations of literature, drama, music, and fine arts. Over the past four years, the leadership organs of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and various associations have relaxed or even abandoned the guidance of literary and artistic creation and criticism; they have shown insufficient concern for the creation and learning of writers and artists, neither seriously conducting discussions on the thoughts of literary and artistic creation nor maintaining frequent contact with writers and artists in thoughts and creation. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has lacked supervision and guidance over the work of various associations; it has also lacked the necessary contact with local literary and art federations. In this way, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has become an organization detached from the masses and also detached from the literary and artistic circles, with no lively work and no vitality. The abnormal situation of the work of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles is worthy of criticism and urgently needs to be changed.

This conference will discuss the tasks in the fields of creation and organization in the current literary and artistic work. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" that the writers of the working class should take socialist realism as their method of creation. The new literary and artistic movement that began with the May Fourth Movement has been advancing in this direction. The brilliant banner of this movement is the great revolutionary realist Lu Xun, who later became a great pioneer and representative of socialist realism in his creative activities. Our outstanding writers Guo Moruo and Mao Dun are old fighters on the front line of the new literary and artistic movement for more than thirty years. They have made many contributions to the creation of revolutionary literature and art. Comrade Mao Zedong has given a high evaluation of the achievements of the new literary and artistic movement since the May Fourth Movement represented by Lu Xun. After the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," our socialist realist literature and art, under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic policy, on the basis of the May Fourth revolutionary tradition, have achieved further development and new great achievements. "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River," "The White-Haired Girl," and "The Storm" are among the outstanding works.

Title: The Development of Socialist Realism in Literature and Art

Page: 1

Our country is currently undergoing a broad and extensive socialist transformation; in people's lives, socialist elements are rapidly increasing and playing a decisive role. A powerful socialist state-owned economy has taken the leading position in the national economy. The Communist Party, as the leader of the state, enjoys unparalleled prestige among the people. The theories of Marxism-Leninism and Comrade Mao Zedong's theories on the Chinese revolution have spread widely among the people. This provides a broader reality for the development of socialist realism in literature and art, making it even more urgent and important for us to further study and master the methods of socialist realism. A writer who does not strive to familiarize himself with the new life of the people and use socialist spirit to educate the masses, helping them move forward, will inevitably become unnecessary to the people and fall behind the times.

Socialist realism is attainable for all writers and artists who are truly progressive and willing to learn; it is not some unattainable, mysterious thing. The key lies in learning.

Apart from learning, there is no shortcut. However, we now have a particularly favorable condition: the great achievements of Soviet socialist realism in literature and art provide us with the best examples to learn from. Of course, such learning must be creative and not merely imitative or plagiaristic.

Currently, our writers and artists have various different ideological and artistic viewpoints. Many of them have not yet fully stood on the proletarian socialist position, but they are willing to do so and are willing to join the Chinese working people in advancing towards a socialist society. The literary and artistic realm is a broad social domain and an important ideological front. On this front, we must first draw the line between the people and the anti-people. All writers and artists who stand on the side of the people should unite. All works that benefit the people should be welcomed.

We take the method of socialist realism as the highest criterion for our entire literary and artistic creation and criticism. Proletarian writers should strive to elevate their works to the level of socialist realism and actively and patiently help all patriotic and progressive writers to move towards the path of socialist realism. Here, impatience and narrow-mindedness are harmful. Each writer and artist will reach socialist realism according to their different life experiences and creative paths. For a writer to become a true, mature socialist realist, a great deal of effort is required. Our literature and art are closely linked with the various aspects of the party, the state, and the people's overall cause, so their activities must be broad and multifaceted, and their forms must be diverse. We advocate free competition among various different artistic forms. Socialist realism not only does not restrict the complete freedom of writers in choosing subjects, forms of expression, and personal style, but it is precisely to ensure this freedom to the greatest extent, thereby fostering the creativity and initiative of writers. Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on theatrical activities, the principle of "a hundred flowers blooming," should become the guiding policy for the development of the entire literary and artistic undertaking. We need both portrait paintings and landscapes; we need both battle hymns and lyrical songs; we need both relatively high-level, complex artistic forms and a large number of relatively simple artistic forms. Socialist realism is, of course, applicable to all literary and artistic creation. However, when we make specific demands of a particular writer or work, we must make distinctions based on the different ideological and artistic tendencies and levels of maturity of each writer, as well as the development and characteristics of various different artistic forms. If someone tries to turn the method of socialist realism into a rigid formula for artistic creation and arbitrarily imposes it on all works, that would be contrary to the spirit of socialist realism. Socialist realism should become a guiding and inspiring force for writers and artists.

Socialist realism first requires our writers to familiarize themselves with the new life of the people, portray the advanced figures among the people, and express the new thoughts and emotions of the people. Comrade Malenkov pointed out in his report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "The power and significance of realistic art lie in the fact that it can and must reveal and express the noble spiritual qualities and typical, positive traits of ordinary people, creating bright, artistic images of ordinary people worthy of being models and examples for others." Comrade Mao Zedong also emphasized in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" that our literature and art must first write about the bright side, write about positive characters. He said:

"The literature of the Soviet Union in the period of socialist construction is mainly about writing the bright side. They also write about shortcomings in work and negative characters, but such descriptions can only serve as a backdrop to the overall brightness and are not what is called 'half and half.'"

In his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," Comrade Mao Zedong called on the writers of the revolutionary base areas at that time to portray "new characters and a new world," and to create works like Fadeyev's "The Destruction."

In the criticism of the film "Wu Xun," Comrade Mao Zedong more clearly and sharply pointed out:

"In the eyes of many authors, the development of history is not about replacing the old with the new, but about making various efforts to preserve the old and prevent it from dying; it is not about using class struggle to overthrow the reactionary feudal rulers who should be overthrown, but like Wu Xun, negating the class struggle of the oppressed people and surrendering to the reactionary feudal rulers. Our authors do not study who the enemies were in the past history that oppressed the Chinese people, and whether there is anything worthy of praise in surrendering to these enemies and even serving them. Our authors also do not study what new social and economic forms, new class forces, new characters, and new thoughts have arisen in China since the Opium War of 1840 and the more than a hundred years of struggle against the old social and economic forms and their superstructures (politics, culture, etc.), and decide what should be praised or sung and what should not be praised or sung, and what should be opposed."

Here, the most important and central task of current literary creation is proposed: to portray new characters and new thoughts, and to oppose the enemies of the people and all backward phenomena within the people.

Our country and society are undergoing a great transformation. We must see that the bad thoughts and habits left over from the old society have a deep-rooted influence on the people, but at the same time, we must also see that the people, after long-term revolutionary struggles, are quickly shedding these influences, especially the younger generation, who are less constrained by these influences. In real life, new characters are emerging. The most sublime task of literary and artistic creation is precisely to portray completely new types of characters who are incompatible with the bad influences left over from the old society, not only to portray our people's today but also to look forward to their tomorrow. Only in this way can literary and artistic works cultivate new qualities in the people and help them move forward.

Literary works need to create positive heroic characters to serve as examples for the people, using this positive, advanced force to struggle against all reactionary and backward things that hinder social progress. We should not separate the portrayal of positive characters from the exposure of negative phenomena. However, we must show that any backward phenomenon will be overcome by the invincible new force. Therefore, we must not place the portrayal of negative characters and positive characters on an equal footing in our works. In our works, we can and should describe the process of transforming backward characters, but we should not regard this as the typical process of the growth of heroes. Can we write about the flaws of heroes? To ask such a question is inappropriate and vague. Heroes can only be discovered in people's lives and cannot be fabricated out of thin air. If a writer has not yet recognized heroic characters and has not yet seen the face of heroes, but first prepares to find flaws in them, is that not strange? Of course, we should not "deify" or "formulaize" heroes. In real life, the character of heroes, as a typical representative of a particular society, has commonality, but each hero also has his own individuality, and their growth processes are varied. The qualities that heroes possess are forged in the fire of revolutionary struggle, in the struggle to overcome difficulties. Here, we must make a fundamental distinction between the growth process of heroes in politics and ideology, certain flaws in character, and mistakes or deviations in daily work and the defects or stains in a person's political and moral qualities. The brilliant character of heroic characters is mainly manifested in their uncompromising attitude towards enemies and all backward phenomena and their limitless loyalty to the people, which is a noble quality. It is precisely this advanced class morality that makes him move thousands and tens of thousands of people and become their model and example to learn from. Heroic characters are not necessarily perfect in every aspect. He is not without flaws, but he takes an uncompromising attitude towards his own flaws, and he can bravely accept the criticism of the masses and bravely engage in self-criticism; this is a manifestation of an excellent quality. Of course, this does not mean that when writing about heroes, we must write about their flaws. Many unimportant flaws of heroes in works can be completely ignored or should be ignored. As for a character who has political and moral flaws or stains that are incompatible with heroic character, such as hypocrisy, selfishness, or even wavering in the revolutionary cause, he is no longer a heroic character, and what value does he have to be praised and sung about? Our writers, in order to highlight the brilliant qualities of heroic characters, consciously ignore some of his unimportant flaws, making him an ideal character that the masses yearn for in the work, which is both possible and necessary. Our realists must also be revolutionary idealists.

Recognizing and portraying new things is not an easy task. First of all, writers must stand in the advanced ranks of the people and, together with the people, struggle to support new things and oppose old things. They cannot stand outside this struggle and adopt a neutral and spectator attitude towards this struggle. They must have the determination that new things will inevitably win, have a keen sense and deep love for new things, and be absolutely uncompromising and unyielding towards old and backward things. It is precisely to eliminate the backward phenomena in life to promote social progress that they go among the ordinary people to seek all advanced and positive forces, and not just to find "ideal" heroes for their works. Therefore, to portray advanced characters, one cannot separate them from the new and old contradictions and struggles in real society. Characters can only fully reveal their personality, character, and qualities in fierce struggles; conversely, the various complex contradictions of the times in society, politics, and ideology can only be concentrated and prominently reflected in the characters' personalities and relationships. Many of our literary works, however, often portray heroes in isolation from social life, without showing the background of their surroundings, and even less showing the inseparable connection between their personal fate and the fate of the entire country, so the characters' personalities cannot be fully developed; from the beginning to the end of the story, there is almost no development and growth of the characters. This is the most common flaw in works portraying new heroic characters. This is mainly because many of our writers have not yet deeply participated in the actual struggles of the masses and carefully observed and analyzed the characters and psychology of various classes and characters.

Writers who want to portray the advanced characters of our times must stand at the forefront of the times' struggles.

Our writers, of course, can portray historical figures; but they must also portray them from a new perspective. We are not looking for historical themes aimlessly, nor are we escaping modern life. In our historical literary works, what we should portray and praise are only those who have promoted the progress of history and have inspirational and educational value for today's people, such as the leaders of peasant revolutions in history, national heroes who have fought for the independence and unity of the country, and great scientists and artists who have made contributions to the people with their creations in science or art, because it is precisely the efforts of these respectable ancestors that have accelerated the time for the people to gain their final liberation. They are the advanced figures of each historical period. We should neither defame nor glorify historical figures. History does not allow distortion. This is why we must seriously criticize the anti-historical tendencies in literary creation.

We require literary and artistic works to portray the characters and thoughts of the new era in content and to portray the national style and spirit in form. All writers and artists must seriously study their own national literary and artistic heritage and take it upon themselves to inherit and carry forward the excellent traditions of national heritage.

In front of us, there is a rich treasure of our own national literary and artistic heritage. These treasures have not been well developed and utilized. The May Fourth New Culture Movement introduced Western bourgeois democratic culture and socialist culture and, at the same time, elevated some parts of our national culture with popular characteristics, such as "Water Margin," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Dream of the Red Chamber," and "The Scholars," to the position of the mainstream of Chinese literature and gave them high evaluations, which was a great historical achievement. However, the May Fourth Movement did not correctly solve the problem of inheriting national literary and artistic heritage. Some people at that time adopted a completely negative attitude towards national heritage, and this attitude, combined with blind admiration for Western bourgeois culture, had a harmful influence on the later development of new literature and art. The idea of neglecting national heritage has long been prevalent among new literary and artistic workers and has not yet been completely overcome. Many literary and artistic workers often only see the feudal and backward aspects of national heritage and do not recognize that these heritages are the spiritual treasury of our great nation, containing many works with rich popular characteristics and remarkable accuracy and conciseness in artistic techniques. Many literary and artistic workers often only grasp some secondary and superficial characteristics of these heritages and do not understand their overall spirit. Their understanding of the value of heritage is often narrow and one-sided. For example, when talking about the characteristics of Chinese novels, it seems that it is only the "chapter and section" format, and painting is only "single-line flat coloring," and music is only folk songs and small tunes. These shallow and simple views hinder us from making broad and deep explorations of heritage.

Systematically organizing and studying national literary and artistic heritage has become one of the most important tasks in our literary and artistic undertakings.

This organizing and studying work is not just the business of a few specialists but requires mobilizing and organizing literary and artistic workers from all aspects (from literary and artistic specialists to folk artists) to jointly carry out this work.

Many classical and folk excellent artworks should be used as models for our literary and artistic workers to learn from. Our realistic tradition in literature, from the "Book of Songs" and "Chu Ci" to the works of Lu Xun, has lasted for more than two thousand years and has been shining with immortal brilliance. Our national opera, painting, and music all have their own long and excellent realistic traditions. We learn from national heritage, mainly to learn their realistic spirit and artistic techniques of daring to expose the truth of life. Creation is a difficult undertaking. Writers not only need to be able to correctly understand the objective world but also need to be able to express their understanding through images using language or other tools. Our ancestors understood this difficulty. More than a thousand years ago, our literary master Lu Ji, in his famous "Wen Fu," said that the most dreaded thing in writing is "the intention does not match the object, and the writing does not match the intention," which translates to "thoughts cannot reflect objective things, and language cannot express thoughts." Great writers of the past have spent countless efforts to master the techniques of language. Many of our young authors pay too little attention to the techniques of literature as a linguistic art. We only need to see how Shui Hu Zhuan, Cao Xueqin, and Wu Jingzi used rich and vivid language to create so many unforgettable artistic images of characters' personalities to know how we should strive.

We must humbly and sincerely learn from experts in various aspects of literature and art and old artists. Many precious heritages are preserved in their bodies. We must value their research work and respect their achievements in artistic creation. National literary publishing institutions must plan to publish well-organized, popular Chinese classical literary works and publish all valuable serious studies on classical writers and works. Literary and artistic organizations must organize forces to extensively and deeply collect folk operas, music, literature, fine arts, and dance works from various places, organize and refine them. Pay attention to helping famous old artists organize their artistic creation experiences. Organizing and studying national artistic heritage should be a key focus of art academies' teaching and research.

We must adopt an analytical attitude towards heritage. We are not accepting heritage indiscriminately and entirely but must selectively accept only the healthy, living, and beneficial parts for the people. First of all, we must distinguish between the democratic and progressive parts and the feudal and backward parts of heritage, and between the realistic parts and the anti-realistic parts. The richness of popular and realistic elements in our literary and artistic heritage is now undeniable; this is what we must inherit and carry forward. We should learn from classical works to better understand the past of the Chinese people, so as to better portray the present and point out the inseparable connection between the struggles of the past and the present, thereby educating the people with patriotic spirit. On the other hand, we must resolutely discard all anti-realistic and formalistic elements in heritage. For example, in national painting, the habit and style of not paying attention to depicting real life and artistic creation but taking the mere imitation of ancient calligraphy as a skill is something we must oppose; now is the time to restore and inherit the correct realistic tradition of national painting. Our national literature and art, after thousands of years of efforts by countless talented ancestors, have created their own unique, outstanding, and expressive styles that reflect the psychology and customs of the people, and therefore are familiar and beloved by the people. Without high technique, such a style cannot be created. The idea that to learn techniques, one can only learn from foreigners and cannot learn anything from one's own heritage is obviously wrong. However, we must also learn from the advanced things of foreign countries to enrich our own traditions and absorb what we lack. The Chinese people have always been good at learning and absorbing the advanced experiences of the people of all times and all countries. Now we must continue to learn from the great heritage left by the great writers and artists of all times and all countries to humanity. Refusing such learning is completely wrong. Our performing artists, vocalists, and painters must learn all progressive techniques and methods from foreign countries. The advanced techniques created by humanity have no national boundaries. Using the methods we learn from abroad to organize and improve our own original techniques, to further enhance our expressive abilities, so that national style can be more perfectly expressed rather than damaged or destroyed, is this not what we need? To strive through long-term hard practice and learning to make our art reach the world level in both thought and technique, is this not what we should strive for? In the work of opera reform, using anti-historical methods to destroy the realistic elements in opera art, and using some inappropriate expression methods learned from foreign drama and music to forcefully add them to opera performances, destroying the original style of national opera, these aspects often show impetuous, rude, and wrong attitudes, but on the other hand, in some small technical reforms, even in some backward habits, they often show extreme conservatism. We must strive for improvement and innovation in technique while maintaining the principle of national style.

Of course, national style is not a fixed thing. As people's lives advance, we must, on the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the national style, strive to create a new national style that is suitable for portraying the new life of the people.

The work of organizing and studying national classical literary and artistic heritage and folk literature and art is, on the one hand, to make new literary and artistic creation connect with our own national traditions, and on the other hand, to make these national traditions, after scientific organization, transformation, and refinement, popularize to the people, truly becoming the beneficial common spiritual wealth of today's people.

In our entire literary and artistic work, if we only pay attention to improvement and not to popularization, we will go astray. Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers in literature and art and his correct regulations on the relationship between improvement and popularization, "improvement on the basis of popularization" and "popularization under the guidance of improvement," are principles that we must strictly follow in literary and artistic undertakings.

First of all, our writers and artists must pay attention to all forms in literature and art that are conducive to popularization and strive to adopt these forms. Therefore, the current backwardness in film and stage play script creation is an intolerable phenomenon. Our writers must pay attention to film, the most popular and powerful art form, and actively participate in film script creation. Creating more excellent film scripts that can portray our great era is a common responsibility of all writers across the country. The Writers' Association should take organizing writers to participate in film script creation as one of its important tasks. Our writers and poets should create more national operas, new operas, and spoken dramas for our stage. New drama and music workers should actively participate in the work of opera reform.

Many of our writers, especially local writers, have engaged in the creation of popular literature and art, which is very necessary. Some good works have emerged in the field of popular literature and art, which deserve our attention. However, at the same time, we must also point out that there is a tendency of rough and shoddy work in the creation of popular literature and art: this tendency damages the credibility of new literary and artistic creation among the working-class and peasant masses, thereby affecting the popularization of new literature and art. On the other hand, some writers have a tendency to be overly ambitious and disregard the needs of the masses and their own abilities: they do not want to write small, popular works but blindly pursue so-called "large-scale" and "high-level" creation. These two tendencies are unacceptable.

Popular literary and artistic works, since they are aimed at the working-class and peasant masses, should especially ensure that they educate the masses with correct thoughts rather than incorrect thoughts, and use beautiful artistic forms to improve the taste level of the masses rather than using shoddy products to corrupt the taste of the masses. If one thinks that things written for workers and peasants can be sloppy, and only things written for intellectuals need to be meticulous in art, that is completely wrong. All progressive writers who truly want to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers should regard creating works that can be understood and loved by millions of people as their most glorious task.

In recent years, the amateur artistic activities of workers, peasants, and soldiers have flourished. These activities are part of the basis for the activities of professional writers and artists. Professional literary and artistic workers should maintain a fixed and regular connection with these activities and assist government cultural departments and trade union cultural departments and military political work departments in guiding these activities.

The working-class and peasant masses have shown their rich creativity in art, just as they have in combat and production activities. Our literary and artistic workers should actively help and guide the masses in creation. The aristocratic attitude of despising the creation of the working-class and peasant masses needs to be continuously overcome and opposed. We must, on the one hand, adopt various methods to popularize all excellent works created by professional writers and artists to the masses, fully value their understanding and appreciation, their likes and dislikes, and seriously listen to their criticism and opinions of the works; on the other hand, we must help them create and perform through amateur activities, discover and cultivate artistic talents among the working people from these activities.

Professional literary and artistic workers, when guiding the amateur artistic activities of the working-class and peasant masses, must also pay special attention to the amateur nature of these activities and clearly understand that the purpose of amateur artistic activities is to improve the culture of workers, not to make amateur artistic activity members detached from their basic production activities. The transformation of amateur drama troupes into professional troupes, arbitrarily and inappropriately pulling amateur writers, performers, or singers out of production to make them professional, is not appropriate.

Correctly helping and guiding the creation of the working-class and peasant masses, discovering and cultivating working-class and peasant writers and artists, is one of the most important tasks in the field of literature and art.

To make our literary and artistic undertakings advance better, mobilize and organize the strength of writers and artists across the country more broadly, and fully tap their enthusiasm and creativity, to create new artistic works that are worthy of the great era with all our might, has become the most urgent task in current literary and artistic work. To adapt to this task, we must strengthen the work of literary and artistic organizations and reorganize them as necessary according to new situations.

The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, established after the First National Congress of Literary and Art Workers in 1949, is of great significance; it embodies the first gathering and great unity of literary and art workers across the country who were once separated by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. However, the Federation, as an organization that is mainly a federation of various literary and art organizations, especially various professional associations, has difficulties in directly and concretely organizing the creation and learning of various different departments of literature and art. Due to the different characteristics of various departments of literature and art, the task of organizing literary and artistic creation should be carried out separately by various associations. Currently, the organizations and work of various associations are being rectified and strengthened. In the future, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles will continue to serve as a federation of literary and art organizations across the country, playing its due role in strengthening the unity and connection of the literary and art circles across the country and mobilizing literary and art workers to participate in national construction and the defense of world peace.

The national committees of various associations propose to change the nature of various associations and redefine their constitutions. Various associations should become voluntary organizations of professional writers and artists, that is, they are not organizations of ordinary literary and art lovers. Associations should take organizing the creation and learning of writers and artists as their main tasks. Therefore, associations must organize extensive research and discussion on creation issues, organize mutual observation and free competition of artistic works or performances; carry out principled criticism and self-criticism on the literary and art front; organize writers and artists to study Marxism-Leninism theory and the policies of the party and the government; organize writers, according to their different situations, to participate in various aspects of actual mass life and struggles. The new draft constitution stipulates the task of studying classical literary and artistic heritage, especially national heritage. The reorganized associations should attract more classical literature researchers, national opera artists, national painters, and national musicians to become members and participate in the leadership. This conference has already had many representatives from these aspects, which shows that the new literary and artistic forces of the people have expanded compared to the First Congress of Literary and Art Workers. The names "old artists" and "old painters" will become history. Guiding the popularization of literature and art, cultivating young writers and artists, are listed as important tasks of the associations. The literary lectures and various literary publications held by the Writers' Association should become powerful tools for cultivating young writers.

In recent years, provincial and municipal literary and art federations have done a lot of work in organizing local literary and art workers to engage in creation and various literary and art propaganda activities that cooperate with central tasks, as well as guiding mass amateur artistic activities, which is commendable. In the past, the guiding principles and tasks of provincial and municipal literary and art federations were not clear. In the future, it should be stipulated that their nature is not a federation of organizations but a comprehensive, voluntary organization of local literary and art workers; its members should include literary, dramatic, musical, and fine art workers from all aspects. In this way, in provinces and municipalities, there is no need to set up various associations separately. To make provincial and municipal literary and art federations become effective organizations for local literary and art workers to engage in literary and artistic activities, their members also need to have certain standards and should not be admitted indiscriminately.

Since provincial and municipal literary and art federations are organizations of local literary and art workers with individuals as members, their main tasks must be to organize their own members to engage in literary and artistic creation to develop local literary and artistic activities. Now, many provincial and municipal literary and art federations have set up professional creation groups, which is a feasible transitional method in places with relatively mature creation personnel. However, the creation objects of provincial and municipal literary and art federations should not be limited to creation groups, and other creation forces should not be neglected; they must give all members with creation abilities the necessary help.

Guiding the amateur artistic activities of the masses is another main task of provincial and municipal literary and art federations. Such guidance should focus on supplying materials for mass amateur artistic activities and guiding the creation of the masses, so as to cooperate with the work of government cultural departments without duplication.

Local literary and art publications should become effective tools for discovering and cultivating local young writers, providing popular literary and art reading materials for the masses, and providing materials for mass amateur artistic performances.

Regarding the tasks of creation and organization that this conference is to solve, I have expressed the above views and hope that the representatives will consider and study them. I believe that after this conference, our literary and artistic creation will surely achieve new development and prosperity.

    为创造更多的优秀的文学艺术作品而奋斗
    ——一九五三年九月二十四日在中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会上的报告
    周扬
    一
    从一九四九年召开第一次全国文学艺术工作者代表大会到今天，整整四年过去了。在这个期间，我们的国家经历了空前未有的、惊天动地的变革。由于中国人民革命的胜利，在中国历史上第一次建立了人民自己的国家，完成了土地改革及其他民主改革，恢复和发展了国民经济，并以抗美援朝的坚决斗争，保卫了祖国，维护了世界和平。现在我们的国家已进入大规模的、有计划的经济建设时期，正坚定而稳步地进行着社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的伟大事业。
    劳动人民作了国家的主人；随着他们的物质生活状况的改善，他们需要新的精神生活。为满足群众的日益增长的文化需要，创造优秀的、真实的文学艺术作品，用爱国主义和社会主义的崇高思想教育人民，鼓舞人民向着社会主义社会前进，这就是文学艺术工作方面的庄严的任务。
    四年来，遵从着毛泽东同志所指示的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，我们的文学艺术活动随着整个人民事业的进展而一同前进。
    新的人民的文学艺术已在基本上代替了旧的、腐朽的、落后的封建阶级和资产阶级的文学艺术。它们在联系群众最广的领域内占领了阵地，并正在继续扩大阵地。曾经占据我国电影市场的充满反动堕落思想和庸俗恶劣趣味的美国影片早已为人民所唾弃；广大观众对国家电影制片厂制作的影片，对具有高度思想性和艺术性的苏联及人民民主国家的影片，表示了最热烈的喜爱。民族传统的戏曲，在内容和舞台形象上，都经过了初步的改革，并创造出了一些新的优秀剧目；而这些新的、经过改革的戏曲，和新的话剧、歌剧一道，受到了更多的观众的欢迎。新的文学作品，包括翻译的苏联文学作品，销路比解放以前增加了十倍至二十倍。新的连环画、年画，新的歌曲、舞蹈都在群众中获得了广泛的传播。文学家、艺术家所创造的一切优秀的艺术作品都迅速地为广大群众所接受，成为他们共同的精神食粮；同时群众又通过多样的业余活动的方式积极地参加了艺术创造的事业；我们的艺术不断地为群众的创作所补充和丰富。所有这些，都使人民的文化生活改善了，丰富了，并使文学艺术和人民群众有了更进一步的密切的联系。
    我们的文学家、艺术家努力地在自己的创作中表现了工农兵的形象，表现了他们的新的面貌和新的品质。中国革命的胜利，社会的改革以及对人民的广泛的政治教育和思想改造的工作，不仅改变了国家的社会经济面貌，而且也改变了人民的道德和精神面貌。人民的政治觉悟和劳动热忱的提高及其新的品质的生长，是我们革命的最重要、最宝贵的成果；这也正是我们的艺术创作所首先需要加以反映的。
    我们的作家们是比较更熟悉他们曾长期亲身经历的革命战争时期的生活和人物的。四年来所发表的作品，小说如柳青的“铜墙铁壁”，徐光耀的“平原烈火”，陈登科的“活人塘”，刘白羽的“火光在前”，马加的“开不败的花朵”，剧本如胡可的“战斗里成长”，以及电影如“白毛女”“钢铁战士”
  “南征北战”“上饶集中营”“翠岗红旗”，都比较真实地描写了国内革命战争和抗日战争时期的一些英雄人物，他们正是在那些艰苦年代里不可屈服的人民的斗争意志的化身。我们的作家们已开始写下了一些表现抗美援朝的伟大斗争的作品，魏巍的有名的通讯集“谁是最可爱的人”引起了广大读者的最热烈的反应。杨朔的小说“三千里江山”，陆柱国的“上甘岭”及其他描写朝鲜战争的短篇，虽还有不成熟的地方，但都在一定程度上表现了中国人民志愿军的高度爱国主义和国际主义的高尚品质和英雄形象。巴金的关于朝鲜战场的作品，以作者素有的全部热情歌颂了我们这个时代的真正的英雄。
    我们的作家们试图表现产业工人的生产劳动和阶级斗争的主题，描绘工业领导干部和模范工人的形象；杜印等的剧本“在新事物面前”，李庆升等的剧本“四十年的愿望”及白朗的小说“为了幸福的明天”，就是在这一方面所作的尝试。老舍继“龙须沟”之后的新作“春华秋实”，努力地表现了工人阶级反对资产阶级不法行为的伟大的“五反”斗争。在描写农村新生活的作品中，婚姻和家庭问题的主题占了显著的地位。青年男女对待婚姻采取了和过去完全不同的新的态度，他们不只是勇敢地争取婚姻的自由，而且自觉地把公共利益放在个人幸福之上。妇女的解放和整个社会的改革不可分地联系着，正是在剧烈的社会斗争中培养了和锻炼了新的妇女的独立的勇敢的性格，这种性格在不少文学和戏剧作品中出色地反映出来了。
    歌颂伟大祖国和保卫世界和平的主题，在一些优秀的诗歌、音乐和美术作品中得到了强烈的鲜明的表现。
    文学艺术领域中的值得特别注意的现象，是继续不断地出现了新的工农的写作者，大家所知道的高玉宝就是其中的一个。同时开始出现了新的少数民族的作者，他们以国内各民族兄弟友爱的精神，真实地描写了少数民族人民生活的新旧光景，创造了少数民族人民中先进分子的形象，他们的作品标志了国内各少数民族文学的新的发展。
    在推进新的文学艺术创作的同时，我们改革和发展了现在还活在人民中间的民族固有的各种艺术，以便使艺术遗产中一切有价值的东西都能由人民充分地利用来建设他们新的文化的生活。新的文学艺术是不能脱离民族的传统而发展的，只有当它正确地吸取了自己民族遗产的精华的时候，它才能真正成为人民的。另一方面，旧的遗产也只有在新的思想基础上加以整理之后，才能完全适合人民的需要。人民珍爱自己民族的优良的戏曲，但是随着他们政治、文化水平和欣赏趣味的提高，他们对旧有戏曲中的某些消极的、有害的内容是不能接受了，看到舞台上丑化、侮辱劳动人民的形象及其它猥亵的粗俗的表演是不能忍耐了。他们要求戏曲的改革。几年来，新的、经过改革的优秀剧目，如
  “梁山伯与祝英台”、“将相和”等，就格外地受到了群众的欢迎。地方戏曲在表现现代生活的题材上也创造了一些成功的经验。在戏曲改革工作上，我们着重批判了对待遗产的粗暴态度，同时也批判了墨守成规、不求改进的保守思想。
    许多戏曲和曲艺的艺人，在戏曲和曲艺的改革上尽了他们的努力。他们在新社会中所受到的国家和人民的重视，他们在和广大工农兵观众的接触中所受到的深刻的感动和启示，以及他们在参加各种社会政治活动中所受到的思想锻炼和教育，使他们大大地提高了爱国的政治热情和创造的积极性。可是我们的有些从事戏曲改革工作的同志往往看不见艺人的这种进步，在工作中不去依靠艺人的创造性和积极性，不尊重他们的技巧和经验，而单凭自己的一股热情或行政命令来办事，这种粗暴态度就使戏曲改革工作受到了一些损失。
    去年和今年所举行的全国戏曲会演和民间音乐舞蹈会演，在改革和发展民族戏曲、音乐、舞蹈的事业上起了重大的推动的作用。民间的以及各少数民族的音乐、舞蹈，为新的音乐舞蹈艺术的创造提供了最丰富的源泉。只有经过对民间音乐、舞蹈的广泛的搜集、整理和加工才能找到发展音乐舞蹈艺术的正确的道路。离开民间基础，凭空创造出来的东西，是得不到群众欢迎的。
    新的年画、连环画的流行，正是由于它采取了民间的形式，这种形式和新的内容正在逐步地、适当地融合起来。但我们对民族绘画、雕塑、建筑艺术的全部遗产还没有给予应有的重视和系统的研究。民族画家正在开始探索如何改进和发展中国古典的绘画艺术的形式，使之和新的创造任务相适合。这是十分必要的。不解决这个任务，民族绘画的优秀传统就不能继续发展。很显然，群众希望在画中看到的首先是他们同时代的人物的形象，而不尽是那些属于遥远的过去的古装仕女；群众爱看日常生活中的美丽的花卉、虫鸟、山水，却不能欣赏那种遁迹林泉，没有人间烟火气的隐士的情调。一切不愿落在时代后面的艺术家都必需懂得并努力地适应群众的需要和爱好。
    整个说来，新的文学艺术创作还是贫弱的。群众感觉新的文学艺术作品太少，特别是电影、戏剧作品太少。人民是有完全的权利要求文艺工作者产生比现在更多而又更好的作品的。因为人民在政治上和文化上迅速地成长了，他们对艺术的要求和趣味迅速地提高了，他们就不但要求新的文学艺术创作有足够供应他们需要的数量，而且还要求这些作品有适合于他们要求的水平。青年们特别尖锐地感觉我们的作品缺乏像苏联的作品那样高度的鼓舞和教育的力量。我们国家的生活是这样地充实和丰富，这样地充满了剧烈的变化，但在我们的作品中所描绘出来的生活图画，却常常是显得单调而乏味的。我们的人民中出现了那么多的忠诚于国家和人民事业的，具有新的高尚的精神品质的英雄，但在我们的作品中却十分缺少这种英雄人物的生动的形象，而人们是多么渴望着在作品中看到这种形象并将他们作为自己学习的榜样啊！
  无可讳言，我们的文学艺术事业同整个人民和国家的事业相比，同人民的需要相比，是远远地落后了。
    当我们对四年来的文学艺术的发展作一回顾的时候，我们可以看到，这个发展并不是一帆风顺的，而是经历了剧烈的思想斗争的。文学艺术是社会观念形态的一种形式，不可能不反映各个阶级的不同利益和思想。虽然在文学艺术上，我国资产阶级并没有甚么贡献和地位；但这并不等于说我们文学艺术就不经常受到资产阶级思想的侵袭，特别是因为工人阶级正处在和资产阶级合作的时期，这种侵袭的危险性就更应引起我们的警惕。
    在解放战争接近胜利结束，我们即将从农村转入城市之前，在某些文艺工作者中间就已经发生了“解放区的文艺到了城市能吃得开吗？”这样的怀疑，这实际上就是表现了对为工农兵服务的文艺方向的动摇。历史做了相反的证明：表现了新的群众的时代的解放区文艺立刻受到了工人和城市劳动人民及进步的知识分子的热忱欢迎。自然，同时我们也听到了一些这样的论调，说解放区的文艺作品是甚么“农民文艺”，说这些作品没有“人情味”，没有“情调”。说这些话的人实际上是瞧不起为工农兵的文艺的。他们的意见是不能代表人民群众的。
    我们的文学艺术总是要表现工农兵的思想和感情的，特别是表现工农兵群众中先进分子的思想和感情，这就是说，要歌颂他们的坚韧的斗争意志、忘我的劳动热忱，表扬他们对集体、对国家、对人民利益的无限忠心，借以培养人民的新的品质和新的道德，帮助人民推动历史前进。而资产阶级文学艺术就恰恰相反，它总是顽强地表现自己，宣传个人主义，个人崇拜、自我欣赏，灌输对国家和人民命运漠不关心、对群众斗争厌恶的思想，借以竭力巩固人们的旧的思想、习惯、偏见，把历史拉向后退。电影“武训传”所以是极端有害的，就在于它巧妙地宣传了对反动的封建统治者投降的思想，宣传了资产阶级的改良主义和个人主义；影片中所歌颂的个人苦行不过是个人主义的一种颠倒的、畸形的表现而已。电影“武训传”正是给这些有毒素的思想，加上艺术的形式，使广大观众和不少文艺工作者，包括某些党员的文艺工作者在内，受到了迷惑。问题的严重性就在这里。一九五一年党中央和毛主席所发起的对电影“武训传”的批判，及时地给了文艺上的这种资产阶级思想的侵袭以有力的回击，同时也给了我们文艺工作者特别是党的文艺工作者以极深刻的难忘的教育。这个批判运动和随之而来的文艺界的整风学习，以及积极地参加反对资产阶级的思想侵蚀和非法行为的“三反”“五反”斗争，大大地帮助了文艺工作者在思想上划清工人阶级和资产阶级的界线。“武训传”批判是工人阶级在思想战线上的一个重大胜利，它使工人阶级思想在文艺领域内的领导地位，获得了进一步的巩固。
    文艺界整风学习的结果，促使更多的作家、艺术家到工厂、农村和朝鲜前线去深入地体验生活。这就为文艺创作和广大群众斗争更进一步相结合开辟了广阔的道路。
    在文学艺术战线上，我们必须对资产阶级思想的各种表现继续进行批判的工作；比方，盲目崇拜西方资产阶级文化，轻视自己民族的传统，就是资产阶级思想的典型的表现之一，这种思想就是必须加以批判的。对资产阶级思想的斗争，是我们的一个长期的任务。同时另一方面，我们又必须反对文学艺术创作上存在的概念化、公式化及其他一切反现实主义的倾向；如果不克服这些倾向，我们的文学艺术就不能前进。为文学艺术上的现实主义斗争，也是我们的一个长期的任务。
    我们的文学艺术基本上是现实主义的。我们的文学艺术作品反映了作为历史创造者的工农兵群众的生活和斗争，反映了现实生活中的尖锐问题，紧密地服从了当前的政治任务，正因为这样，许多的作品对人民发挥了积极的教育作用，对人民的各种斗争和国家建设作了有益的贡献。我们文学艺术中的这个基本的现实主义的倾向，是不容忽视或抹杀的。但是另一方面，我们的文学作品直到现在还没有能够把中国人民在长期斗争中所积累的各方面的丰富经验在艺术上加以综合和概括，还没有能够创造出卓越的正面人物的典型形象，许多作品都还不免于概念化、公式化的缺陷，这就表现了我们的文学艺术中现实主义薄弱的方面。主观主义的创作方法是严重存在的。有些作家在进行创作时，不从生活出发，而从概念出发，这些概念大多只是从书面的政策、指示和决定中得来的，并没有通过作家个人对群众生活的亲自体验、观察和研究，从而得到深刻的感受，变成作家的真正的灵感源泉和创作基础。这些作家不是严格地按照生活本身的发展规律，而是主观地按照预先设定的公式来描写生活。但是对大多数作家来说，这种主观主义并不是有意识的。他们参加了实际的群众生活和群众斗争，并且也极力想要真实地来描写生活，但是由于他们没有十分深刻地全面地认识生活和理解生活，而有些作家，特别是年青的作家，又还没有充分地掌握表现生活的创作方法和文学技巧，这就形成了产生概念化、公式化的最普遍最主要的原因。要克服创作上的概念化、公式化的倾向，关键就在于提高作家的认识生活和表现生活的能力。现在许多作家深入了群众生活，他们已进一步体会到，作家必须从斗争中、生产中、工作中去建立和群众的真实的亲密的联系，同时必须学会以马克思列宁主义理论及党和国家的政策的观点来考察、估量和研究生活，免使自己掉在生活的大海里而迷失方向。
    文学艺术创作上的概念化、公式化倾向之所以不容易克服，还由于一种把艺术服从政治的关系简单化、庸俗化的思想作祟。
    文学艺术区别于其它观念形态的根本特点是借助于形象来表达思想，没有形象，就没有艺术，而形象是只能从生活中吸取来的。我们的有些文艺工作的领导者和不少的作家，却往往不理解艺术的这个根本特点。他们离开艺术形象的真实性去追求抽象的政治性，不去要求作品创造有典型性的、有生命、有性格的人物，而只要求作品中的人物作某种思想的简单的传声筒；其结果，人物不是在一定环境中自然地、合乎规律地行动着、发展着的活生生的人，而是听凭作者任意摆布的傀儡；思想不是渗透在作品的艺术组织当中，而只是一些硬加到作品中去的抽象的议论。作品中需要有人物好像只是为了借他们来解说各种具体的政策，而并不是通过具有高尚品质、思想、情感的人物的真实形象来感染和打动读者。马克思、恩格斯早就提醒作家不要为了席勒而忘了莎士比亚，不要为了思想的因素而忘了现实的因素。列宁、斯大林一再强调作家必须忠实于生活。毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中也特别强调了作家必须深刻地观察、体验和研究人民的生活，他要求文学艺术的政治性和真实性的完全一致。
    当然，文艺作品是应当表现党的政策的。文艺创作离开了党和国家的政策，就是离开了党和国家的领导。政策是根据社会发展的客观规律制定的，是集中地反映和代表人民的根本利益的。作家在观察和描写生活的时候，必须以党和国家的政策作为指南。他对社会生活中的任何现象都必须从政策的观点来加以估量。作家必须表现政策在群众生活中所产生的伟大力量。我们的政策总是依靠群众和干部来推行的。政策一经被千百万群众掌握之后就以无可拒抗的力量改变着和指导着人民的生活，决定着整个国家和人民的命运。因此，在艺术作品中表现政策，最根本地就是表现党和人民的血肉相连的关系以及党对群众的领导，表现人民中先进和落后力量的斗争，表现共产党员作为先锋队的模范作用，表现人民民主制度的优越性。因此，正确地表现政策和真实地描写生活两者必须完全统一起来。而生活描写的真实性则是现实主义艺术的最高原则。
    文艺作品必须描写人物，描写人的思想和情感。只有通过人物，才能反映阶级斗争和生产斗争。因此有些描写生产的文艺作品不去歌颂劳动，歌颂劳动者的奋斗精神和创造精神，而去单纯地表现生产技术过程，操作方法，甚至表现机器动作
  （如像好些舞蹈所表现的那样），那不但是违反艺术的要求，而且是缺乏政治思想内容的。
    新的文学艺术一般地说还是比较年青的，它们正在成长的过程中。它们面前有许多困难。文艺工作的领导方面的主要责任应当是尽一切力量帮助它们健全地成长，支持它们的每一步的新的进展，同时耐心地帮助它们克服缺点和困难。新的年青的文学艺术事业是十分需要正确的、具体的、细致的领导的。
    那末，现在看看，我们文艺领导工作的状况如何呢？不能不说，是十分不能令人满意的。这正是造成目前文学艺术工作的落后现象的严重原因。
    列宁在一九○五年所写的“党的组织和党的文学”的有名的文章中曾经指出：“文学事业应当必定成为和其它部分不可分离地联系着的、社会民主党的工作的一部分”，但他同时也指出了这个部分不能和其他部分“刻板地一样看待”，“文学事业最不允许机械的平均、划一，少数服从多数”，“在这种事业上必须无条件地保证给个人的创造性，个人的爱好以广大活动余地，给思考和幻想，形式和内容以广大活动余地”。这就是说，文学艺术活动必须受党和国家的领导，这是不可动摇的、确定不移的原则；但这种领导又必须十分注意文学艺术活动的特点。
    我们在工作中常常违背了列宁的原则。一方面，没有把文学艺术事业经常看成党的整个事业的一个和其他部分不可分离地联系着的部分，没有帮助作家认真地研究党和国家的政策，积极地参加群众的实际斗争，致使文学艺术工作中发生脱离政治、脱离实际的现象；另一方面，又往往不顾文学艺术活动的规律，在对文学艺术活动的指导上表现了粗暴的态度。
    我们比较地习惯于采取简单的行政方式，而不善于运用社会方式来领导艺术创作的活动。有些文艺工作的领导机关在布置创作任务的时候，往往不顾各个作家的不同生活经验和写作能力而任意地像对待小学生似地给他们规定题目，规定完成创作的时限，甚至规定创作的形式。而在作品写成的时候，又往往简单地、轻率地加以否定，没有把一个作品的成功或失败当作重要事情看待，因而也就很少认真地去研究和总结这种成功或失败的经验来具体地帮助作家。这种对于创作的行政式的领导方法正是无思想、无政治的领导的表现，同时也就助长了创作上概念化、公式化的错误倾向。对文学艺术创作活动是更适宜于用社会方式来推动的。我们应当更多地依靠作家、艺术家自己的团体来组织他们的创作，更多地发动作家、艺术家相互间在创作上的自由竞赛，发动他们中间的正确的批评和自我批评，发动正确的社会舆论来推动和指导创作；这样才能创造适宜于创作发展的气氛，创造作家的艺术劳动的最有利的条件。这些就是我们过去所忽视了的方面。自然，这样做并不是为了减弱党和政府对文学艺术事业的领导，而恰恰是为了更好地实现这种领导。
    文艺批评是推动和指导文艺创作的最主要的方法之一。自电影“武训传”批判以后，我们对文艺创作中的资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想倾向以及对文艺创作上的粗制滥造、不负责任的现象进行了尖锐的批评，这是完全必要的。没有这种批评，我们的文学艺术就会陷于停滞或走入歧途。两三年来，我们的文艺批评工作是有成效的。在一部分文艺工作者中间，现在有一种害怕批评、憎恶批评的情绪，这种情绪，不能认为是正常的。但在我们的批评工作中发生了一些偏向，则应当加以纠正。首先必须指出的是批评的态度。有些批评家往往没有把整个倾向是反人民的作品和有缺点甚至有错误但整个倾向是进步的作品加以区别，没有把作家对生活的有意识的歪曲和由于作家认识能力不足或是表现技术不足而造成的对生活的不真实的描写加以区别，而在批评的时候一律采取揭露的、打击的态度。任何缺点、错误，都是应当批评的，但只要它不是反人民的作品，就必须首先肯定其正确的方面，然后批评其缺点和错误，并积极地指出改正的途径。批评家对于作家缺乏应有的同志般的爱护的态度，没有将严正的批评和热情的鼓励，将对作家的严格的要求和对他的创作命运的关心正确地结合起来。批评一般是指责多而帮助少。其次，是批评的方法。有些批评家在批评一个作品的时候，常常不是从实际出发，而是从教条公式出发。他们常常武断地、笼统地指责一篇作品这样没有描写对，那样也没有描写对，但却很少指出究竟怎样描写才对。批评家往往比作家更缺乏对于生活的基本知识和深刻的理解，同时缺乏对作品作具体的艺术分析的能力。
    报刊上所发表的一些粗暴的、武断的批评，以及在这种批评影响下所煽起的一部分读者的偏激意见，再加上文艺界的领导方面对文学艺术创作事业缺少关心、帮助和支持，这就使不少作家在精神上感到了压抑和苦恼。这种情绪是需要设法转变的。我们的批评必须有助于鼓励作家、艺术家的创造性和积极性，发挥艺术创造的潜力，而不能是相反。同时我们的作家也必须有听取批评甚至听取不正确的批评的勇气和度量，并以作家的资格积极地、主动地参加批评的活动。我们的文艺批评，也正如创作一样，是年青的；它同样地需要支持和扶植。显然地，目前批评工作是必须加强而不能丝毫削弱的。纠正批评工作中的偏向，发展有利于创作事业的正确批评，这是作家和批评家共同的任务。
    上面所讲的文艺工作中的一些错误和缺点，都是和全国文联及文学、戏剧、音乐、美术等各个协会的工作状况分不开的。四年来，全国文联和各个协会的领导机关放松了甚至放弃了对文艺创作和批评的指导；对于作家、艺术家的创作和学习表现了不够关心的态度，既没有认真地进行有关文学艺术创作思想的讨论，又缺少和作家、艺术家在思想上和创作上的经常的接触。全国文联对各个协会的工作缺少监督和指导；对各地方文联也缺少应有的联系。这样，就使全国文联成为一个脱离群众，也脱离文艺界的没有活跃的工作，没有生气的机关。全国文联工作的这种不正常的状况，是应当受到指责的，是亟需加以改变的。
        二
    这次大会将要讨论当前文学艺术工作在创作方面和组织方面的任务。毛泽东同志早在“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中就曾指出工人阶级的作家应当以社会主义现实主义作为创作方法。从“五四”开始的新文艺运动就是朝着这个方向前进的，这个运动的光辉旗手鲁迅就是伟大的革命的现实主义者，在他后来的创造活动中更成为社会主义现实主义的伟大先驱者和代表者。我们杰出的作家郭沫若和茅盾，都是三十几年来新文艺运动战线上的老战士。他们对革命文艺的创造是作了很多贡献的。毛泽东同志对以鲁迅为代表的“五四”以来的新文艺运动的成就给了很高的评价。“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”以后，我们的社会主义现实主义的文学艺术，就在毛泽东的文艺方针的指导下，在“五四”革命传统的基础上，取得了进一步的发展和新的巨大的成就。获得斯大林奖金的“太阳照在桑干河上”、“白毛女”、“暴风骤雨”，就是其中优秀的作品。
    现在我们的国家正在逐步地和广泛地进行着社会主义的改造；在人民生活中社会主义因素正日益迅速地增长着并起着决定的作用。强大的社会主义的国营经济已取得了整个国民经济中的领导地位。共产党作为国家政权的领导者在人民当中享有了无上的威信。马克思列宁主义的理论以及毛泽东同志关于中国革命的学说在全国人民中有极广泛的传播。这就使得社会主义现实主义的文学艺术的发展有了更广大的现实基础，因而进一步学习和掌握社会主义现实主义的方法对于我们来说就具有更迫切和更重要的意义了。一个作家如果不努力去熟悉人民的新的生活，努力用社会主义精神去教育群众，帮助他们前进，那他就将要不可避免地为人民所不需要，而成为时代的落伍者。
    社会主义现实主义，对于一切真正愿意进步、愿意学习的作家、艺术家，都是能够达到的；它并不是甚么高不可及的、神秘的东西。重要的是在于学习。
    除了学习，我们是没有别的捷径可走的。但现在我们却有一个特别便利的条件：苏联社会主义现实主义的文学艺术的巨大成就提供了我们学习的最好的范本。自然，这种学习必须是具有创造性的而不能是抄袭和模仿。
    目前我国的作家、艺术家还存在着许多不同的思想意识和艺术观点，他们中间很多人今天还不能说已经站在工人阶级社会主义的立场，但他们却愿意站到这个立场上来，愿意和中国劳动人民一道走进社会主义社会。文学艺术界是一个广大的社会的领域，又是一个重要的思想的战线。我们在这个战线上首先要划分的，是人民和反人民的界线。一切站在人民立场的作家、艺术家都应团结起来。一切于人民有益的作品，都应当受到欢迎。
    我们把社会主义现实主义方法作为我们整个文学艺术创作和批评的最高准则。工人阶级的作家应当努力把自己的作品提高到社会主义现实主义的水平，同时积极地耐心地帮助一切爱国的、愿意进步的作家都转到社会主义现实主义的轨道来。在这里，性急的态度和狭隘的作风是有害的。各个作家、艺术家都是按照他们各人不同的生活经历和创作道路来达到社会主义现实主义的。一个作家要使自己变为一个真正的成熟的社会主义现实主义者，需要有一个极大的努力过程。我们的文学艺术是同党、国家和人民的整个事业的各个方面密切不可分地联系着的，因此它的活动必须是广泛的、多方面的，它的形式必须是多种多样的。我们提倡各种不同的艺术形式的自由竞赛。社会主义现实主义不但不束缚作家在选择题材、在表现形式和个人风格上的完全自由，而且正是最大限度地保证这种自由，借以发挥作家的创造性和积极性。毛泽东同志关于戏曲活动所指示的“百花齐放”的原则应当成为整个文学艺术事业发展的方针。我们既需要人物画，也需要风景画；既需要战斗的进行曲，也需要抒情的歌曲；我们既需要有比较高级的、复杂的艺术形式，也需要有大量的、比较简易的艺术形式。社会主义现实主义当然对一切文学艺术创作都是适用的。但在我们对一个具体作家或作品提出要求的时候，就必须根据各个作家在思想和艺术上的不同的倾向和成熟程度及各种不同艺术形式的发展情况和特点而有所区别。如果有人企图把社会主义现实主义方法变成艺术创作的死的格式，用他自己主观的尺寸来随便地硬套一切作品，那就和社会主义现实主义的精神正相违背了。社会主义现实主义应当成为指导和鼓舞作家、艺术家前进的力量。
    社会主义现实主义首先要求我们的作家去熟悉人民的新的生活，表现人民中的先进人物，表现人民的新的思想和感情。马林科夫同志在联共第十九次党代表大会上的报告中指出：“现实主义艺术的力量和意义就在于：它能够而且必须发掘和表现普通人的高尚的精神品质和典型的、正面的特质，创造值得做别人的模范和效仿对象的普通人的明朗的艺术形象。”毛泽东同志的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中也特别强调地提出了我们的文学艺术必须首先写光明，写正面人物。他说：
    “苏联在社会主义建设时期的文学就是以写光明为主。他们也写工作中的缺点，也写反面的人物，但是这种描写只能成为整个光明的陪衬，并不是所谓‘一半对一半’。”
    毛泽东同志在这个讲话中号召当时革命根据地的作家们表现“新的人物，新的世界”，写出像法捷耶夫的“毁灭”那样的作品。
    在关于电影“武训传”的批评中，毛泽东同志更明确地尖锐地指出：
    “在许多作者看来，历史的发展不是以新事物代替旧事物，而是以种种努力去保持旧事物使它得免于死亡；不是以阶级斗争去推翻应当推翻的反动的封建统治者，而是像武训那样否定被压迫人民的阶级斗争，向反动的封建统治者投降。我们的作者们不去研究过去历史中压迫中国人民的敌人是些什么人，向这些敌人投降甚至为他们服务的是否有值得称赞的地方。我们的作者们也不去研究自从一八四○年鸦片战争以来的一百多年中，中国发生了一些什么向着旧的社会经济形态及其上层建筑（政治、文化等等）作斗争的新的社会经济形态，新的阶级力量，新的人物和新的思想，而去决定什么东西是应当称赞或歌颂的，什么东西是不应当称赞或歌颂的，什么东西是应当反对的。”
    这里就提出了当前文艺创作的最重要的、最中心的任务：表现新的人物和新的思想，同时反对人民的敌人，反对人民内部的一切落后的现象。
    我们的国家和社会，正在经历着一个巨大的改造过程。我们应当看到旧社会所遗留的坏思想和坏习惯在人民身上有根深蒂固的影响，但是同时更应当看到人民经过长期革命斗争的锻炼正在迅速地摆脱这些影响，特别是青年的一代就更少受到这些影响的拘束。在现实生活中，新的人物正在涌现出来。而文艺创作的最崇高的任务，恰恰是要表现完全新型的人物，这种人物必须是和旧社会所遗留的坏影响水火不相容的，恰恰是不只要表现我们人民的今天，而且要展望到他们的明天。只有这样，文学艺术作品才能培养人民的新的品质，帮助人民前进。
    文艺作品所以需要创造正面的英雄人物，是为了以这种人物去做人民的榜样，以这种积极的、先进的力量去和一切阻碍社会前进的反动的和落后的事物作斗争。不应将表现正面人物和揭露反面现象两者割裂开来。但是必须表现出任何落后现象都要为不可战胜的新的力量所克服。因此决不可把在作品中表现反面人物和表现正面人物两者放在同等的地位。在我们的作品中可以而且需要描写落后人物被改造的过程，但不可以把这看为英雄成长的典型的过程。写英雄可不可以写他的缺点呢？这样提出问题就是不恰当的，笼统的。英雄是只能从人民生活中去发现的，而不能凭空地去虚构。如果一个作家还没有认识英雄人物，还没有看清楚英雄的面目，就首先准备去寻找他身上的缺点，这岂不是很奇怪的吗？我们当然不应当把英雄“神化”或“公式化”。在现实生活中，作为特定的社会典型的人民英雄的性格是有共同性的，但各个英雄又具有自己的个性，他们的成长过程也是各种各样的。英雄所具有的品质是不断地在革命斗争的火焰中，在克服困难的斗争中锻炼出来的。在这里，我们必须把英雄人物在政治上思想上的成长过程，性格上的某些缺点以及日常工作中的过失或偏差和一个人的政治品质、道德品质的缺陷加以根本的区别。英雄人物的光辉灿烂的人格主要表现在对敌人及一切落后现象决不妥协，对人民无限忠诚的那种高尚的品质上，他之所以能打动千百万群众，成为他们学习和仿效的榜样，也就在于他所表现的那种先进阶级的道德的力量。英雄人物并不一定在一切方面都是完美无疵的。他并非没有缺点，但他对他自己的缺点采取不调和的态度，他能够勇敢地接受群众的批评和勇敢地进行自我批评；这正是一种优秀品质的表现。当然，这决不是说作家写英雄的时候都要写出他的缺点，许多英雄的不重要的缺点在作品中是完全可以忽略或应当忽略的。至于一个人物如果具有和英雄性格绝不相容的政治品质、道德品质上的缺陷或污点，如虚伪、自私甚至对革命事业发生动摇等，那就根本不成其为英雄人物了，他还有什么价值值得人去称赞和歌颂呢？我们的作家为了要突出地表现英雄人物的光辉品质，有意识地忽略他的一些不重要的缺点，使他在作品中成为群众所向往的理想人物，这是可以的而且必要的。我们的现实主义者必须同时是革命的理想主义者。
    认识新事物，表现新事物，并不是一件很容易的事。首先需要的是，作家必须站在人民的先进的行列，和人民一道，为拥护新事物和反对旧事物而斗争。他不能置身于这个斗争之外，对于这个斗争采取中立和旁观的态度。他必须抱有争取新事物必胜的决心，对新事物具有锐敏的感觉和高度的热爱，而对于旧的落后的事物则绝不调和妥协。他正是为了消灭生活中的落后现象以推动社会的前进，才去在普通人民中寻求一切先进的、积极的力量，而不只是为了替自己的作品物色“理想”的英雄。因此要表现先进人物，是不能离开现实社会中新旧的矛盾和斗争来描写的。人物只有在剧烈的斗争中，才能显示他的全部个性、性格和品质；反过来，时代的社会、政治和思想的种种错综复杂的矛盾又只有在人物的性格和相互关系上才能集中地、突出地反映出来。我们的许多文艺作品却往往离开社会生活孤立地去表现英雄，既看不出他周围环境的背景，更看不出他个人的命运和整个国家的命运的不可分的联系，因而英雄的性格就不能得到应有的展开；从故事的开头到结尾，几乎看不到人物的发展和成长。这就是表现新英雄人物的作品中最常见的毛病。这主要地就是因为我们的许多作家还没有深入到群众的实际斗争中，仔细观察和分析各个阶级、各种人物的性格和心理的原故。
    作家要表现我们时代的先进人物，就必须站到这个时代的斗争的最前面。
    我们的作家当然可以描写历史的人物；但也必须用新的观点去表现他们。我们决不是无目的地，更不是为了逃避现代生活而去寻找历史的题材。在我们的历史文学作品中所要表现和赞扬的，应当只是那些推动了历史前进的，对今天的人民还有鼓舞和教育作用的人物，例如历代农民革命的领袖，为国家的独立和统一而舍身奋斗的民族英雄，以及以自己在科学或艺术上的创造对人民作了贡献的伟大的科学家、艺术家们，因为正是这些可尊敬的祖先们的努力，加速了人民获得最后解放的时间的到来，他们正是各个历史时代的先进人物。我们对待历史人物既不能丑化，也不应美化。历史是不容许歪曲的。这就是为什么我们必须严肃地批判文艺创作中的反历史主义的倾向的原因。
    我们要求文学艺术作品在内容上表现新的时代的人物和思想，在形式上表现民族的作风和气派。一切作家、艺术家都必须认真地学习自己民族的文学艺术遗产，把继承并发扬民族遗产的优良传统引为己任。
    在我们面前，有我们自己民族的丰富的文学艺术遗产的宝藏。这些宝藏是还没有很好地加以开发和利用的。“五四”新文化运动介绍了西方资产阶级民主主义文化和社会主义文化，同时把自己民族文化中的带有人民性的一部分，例如“水浒”“三国演义”“红楼梦”“儒林外史”等作品，提到了中国文学正宗的地位，给了高度的评价，这是一大历史功劳。但是“五四”运动没有正确解决继承民族文学艺术遗产的任务。当时的有些人对民族遗产采取了错误的完全否定的态度，这种态度，和对西方资产阶级文化的盲目崇拜相结合，就给了后来新文学艺术的发展以有害的影响。轻视民族遗产的观念在新的文艺工作者中间曾相当长期地普遍地存在，现在也还没有完全克服。不少的文艺工作者往往只看到民族遗产的封建性和落后性的一面，而没有认识到，这些遗产是我们伟大民族的精神宝库，其中蕴藏着不少具有丰富的人民性的、在艺术技巧上达到可惊的准确和精练程度的现实主义的作品。不少的文艺工作者常常只抓到了这些遗产的某些次要的、外表的特点，而没有领会它们的整个精神。他们对遗产价值的理解，常常是狭隘的、片面的。比方，谈到中国小说的特点，仿佛就只是“章回体”，绘画就只是“单线平涂”，音乐除了民歌小调再没有什么。这些肤浅的、简单的看法就妨碍了我们向遗产作广泛的、深入的发掘。
    系统地整理和研究民族文学艺术遗产的工作，就成为我们文学艺术事业上的最重要的任务之一。
    这种整理研究的工作，决不只是少数专门家的事情，而是需要动员和组织各方面的文学艺术工作者（从文学艺术专门家到民间艺人）共同来进行的工作。
    许多古典的和民间的优秀艺术作品应作为我们文学艺术工作者学习的典范。我们文学上的现实主义的传统，从诗经、楚辞到鲁迅的作品，绵延两千多年之久，始终放射着不朽的光辉。我们民族的戏曲、绘画和音乐都有自己悠久的、优良的现实主义的传统。我们向民族遗产学习，主要就是学习它们勇于揭露生活真实的现实主义精神和艺术技巧。创作是一件困难的事业，作家不但要能够正确地认识客观世界，而且要能够用语言或其他的工具把自己的认识通过形象表现出来。我们的祖先是懂得这种困难的。一千多年前，我国的文学家陆机在他有名的“文赋”中就说过，作文章最怕的是“意不称物，文不逮意”，翻成现在的话，就是“思想不能反映客观事物，语言不能表达思想”。历代伟大的文学家为了掌握语言的技术，曾呕尽了多少心血啊！我们的许多的年青的作者对于作为语言艺术的文学的技术是太不注意了。我们只要看看施耐庵、曹雪芹、吴敬梓如何运用丰富生动的语言创造了那么多的令人难忘的人物性格的艺术形象，就知道我们该当如何地去努力了。
    我们必须虚心地、诚诚恳恳地向文学艺术各方面的专家们以及老艺人们学习，许多宝贵的遗产就保存在他们的身上。我们必须重视他们的研究工作，尊重他们在艺术创造上的成就。国家文学出版机关必须有计划地出版经过整理的、具有人民性的中国古典的文学作品，出版对于古典作家和作品的一切有价值的认真的研究著作。文艺机关团体必须组织力量，广泛而深入地搜集各地民间戏曲、音乐、文学、美术、舞蹈作品，加以整理和加工。注意帮助著名老艺人整理他们的艺术创造的经验。整理和研究民族艺术遗产，应当成为艺术学院的教学和研究的重点之一。
    我们对待遗产又必须采取分析的态度。我们不是把遗产无区别地、全部地接受，而必须是有选择地只接受其中健康的、有生命的、有益于人民的部分。首先必须将遗产中的民主性和进步性的部分与封建性和落后性的部分加以区别，将现实主义的部分和反现实主义的部分加以区别。我们文学艺术遗产中人民性和现实主义的丰富，现在是没有人能够怀疑的了；这是我们所必须加以继承和发扬的。我们应当从学习古典作品中来更好地了解中国人民的过去，以便更好地来表现现代，指出现在的斗争和过去的斗争之间的不可分的联系，从而用爱国主义的精神教育人民。另一方面，我们必须断然地抛弃遗产中一切反现实主义的、形式主义的东西。如在民族绘画中，那种不注重描写现实生活，不注重艺术创造，而以单纯模仿古人笔墨为能事的积习和作风，是必须反对的；现在是恢复和继承民族绘画中现实主义正确传统的时候了。我们民族的文学艺术，经过数千年来无数天才的祖先们的努力，创造了自己独特的，卓越的，表现了人民的心理和风习的，因而为人民所习惯和喜爱的风格。没有高度的技巧，是创造不出这种风格来的。那种以为要学技术，只能向外国去学，从中国自己的遗产是学不到什么的观点，显然是错误的。但是我们必须同时向外国的先进事物学习，来丰富我们自己的传统，来吸取我们所缺乏的东西。中国人民从来是善于学习和吸收外国文化中的一切先进经验的。现在我们必须继续地向各个时代各个国家的人民中的伟大作家、艺术家所遗留给人类的遗产学习。拒绝这种学习是完全错误的。我们的表演艺术家、声乐家、画家必须向外国学习一切进步的技术方法。人类所创造的一切先进的技术，是没有国界区别的。将我们从外国学来的方法，用来整理和提高自己民族原有的技术，用来进一步增强我们的表现能力，使民族风格得到更完满的表现而不是受到损害和破坏，这难道不正是我们所需要的吗？以长期的苦练苦学，使我们的艺术不但在思想上，而且在技术上达到世界的水平，这难道不正是我们所应努力的吗？在戏曲改革工作中，用反历史主义的方法破坏戏曲艺术中的现实主义，用从外国戏剧、音乐中学来的某些不适当的表现方法生硬地加在戏曲表演中，破坏民族戏曲的原有风格，在这些方面经常表现了急躁的、粗暴的、错误的态度，但在另一方面，在一些小小的技术的改革上，甚至在一些落后习惯的改革上，则又往往表现了非常的保守。我们必须在保持民族风格的原则下，在技术上力求改进和革新。
    自然，民族风格也决不是一成不变的东西。随着人民生活的前进，我们必须在继承和发扬民族固有风格的基础上进一步努力来创造适合于表现人民新生活的新的民族风格。
    整理和研究民族的古典文学艺术遗产和民间文学艺术的工作，一方面是为了使新的文学艺术的创造和自己的民族传统相衔接，同时另一方面又是为了要使这些民族传统的艺术经过科学的整理、改造和加工之后再普及到人民群众中去，真正成为今天人民的有益的共同的精神财富。
    在我们的整个文学艺术工作中，如果我们只注意提高，而不注意普及，那我们就要走上错误的路线了。毛泽东同志所指示的文艺为工农兵服务的方向以及他关于提高和普及的正确关系的规定：“在普及基础上的提高”和“在提高指导下的普及”，是我们文学艺术事业上所必须严格遵从的原则。
    首先，我们的文学家、艺术家必须注意文学艺术中一切有利于普及的形式，并努力采用这些形式。正因为如此，目前电影和舞台剧本创作的落后就成为了不可容忍的现象。我们的作家必须重视电影这种最群众化的、最有力量的艺术形式，而积极地参加电影剧本的创作。创造更多的、优秀的、能够表现我们的伟大时代的电影剧本，应当是全国作家的一个共同的责任。作家协会应当以组织作家参加电影剧本创作作为它的一个重要的任务。我们的文学家、诗人应当为我们的舞台创造更多的民族戏曲、新歌剧和话剧剧本。新的戏剧、音乐工作者，应当更积极地参与戏曲改革的工作。
    我们的不少作家，特别是地方的作家，从事了通俗文艺创作的工作，这是十分需要的。通俗文艺方面已产生了一些思想性、艺术性都较好的作品，值得我们的重视。但是同时我们也必须指出，通俗文艺创作上存在粗制滥造的倾向：这种倾向损害了新的文学艺术创作在工农劳动群众中的信用，因而影响了新的文学艺术的普及。另一方面，有些作家又有一种不顾群众需要和主观能力的好高骛远的倾向：不愿写小的、通俗的作品，而盲目地去追求所谓“大型”的“高级”的创作。这两种倾向都是要不得的。
    通俗文艺作品既是以工农群众为对象的，就应当特别保证它们是在以正确的思想而不是以错误的思想教育群众，它们是在用优美的艺术形式提高群众的趣味水平，而不是在以粗劣的制造品去败坏群众的趣味。如果以为写给工农看的东西可以马虎些，只有写给知识分子看的作品才应当讲究艺术，那就根本错误了。一切进步的、真正愿意为工农兵服务的作家们都应当把创造能为千百万群众所理解和爱好的作品当作自己最光荣的任务。
    几年来，工农兵群众的业余艺术活动有了蓬勃的发展。这些活动正是专业的作家、艺术家的活动的基础的一部分。专业的文艺工作者应当和这些活动保持固定的经常的联系，协助政府和工会的文教部门及军队的政治工作部门指导这些活动。
    工农群众在艺术上也如在战斗和生产的活动上一样表现了他们的丰富的创造力。我们的文学艺术家应当积极地帮助和指导群众进行创作。轻视工农群众创作的贵族式的态度是需要继续加以克服和反对的。我们必须一方面采取各种方式将专业作家、艺术家所创造的一切优秀作品普及到群众中去，充分地重视他们的理解力和欣赏力，他们的爱好和趣味，并认真地倾听他们对作品的批评和意见；另一方面，必须帮助他们通过业余活动方式进行自己的创作和表演，从这些活动中发现和培养劳动人民中的艺术天才。
    专业的文艺工作者在辅导工农群众的业余艺术活动的时候，又必须十分注意这种活动的业余的性质，必须明确，业余艺术活动的目的是提高劳动者的文化，而不是使业余艺术活动分子脱离他们基本的生产的活动。业余剧团向专业化发展，将业余的写作者、表演者或歌唱者任意地、不适当地从生产中抽出来使之专业化，是不妥的。
    正确地帮助和指导工农群众创作，发现和培养工农作家、艺术家，是我们文学艺术方面的最重要的任务之一。
        三
    为了使我们的文学艺术事业更好地前进，更广泛地动员和组织全国的作家、艺术家的力量，更高度地发挥他们的积极性和创造性，以全力创造能够无愧于伟大时代的新的艺术作品，就成为当前文学艺术工作中最迫切的任务。而要适应这个任务，就必须加强文学艺术团体的工作，并按照新的情况对这些团体加以必要的改组。
    全国文联在一九四九年全国文学艺术工作者代表大会之后成立，是具有重大的意义的；它体现了曾被国民党反动统治所分隔了的全国文学艺术工作者的第一次的大会师，大团结，但是，文联作为各个文学艺术团体，主要是各个专业的协会的联合会这样一种组织形式，要来直接地、具体地组织文学艺术各个不同部门的创作和学习，是有困难的。由于文学艺术各部门的特点不同，组织文学艺术创作的任务，宜于由各个协会分别地来进行。现在各个协会的组织和工作正在整顿和加强，今后全国文联将继续作为全国文学艺术团体的联合组织，在加强全国文学艺术界的团结和联系，动员文学艺术工作者参加国家建设和保卫世界和平的活动上起它应有的作用。
    各个协会的全国委员会提议将各个协会的性质加以改变，并重新规定它们的章程。各个协会应当成为专业的作家、艺术家的自愿的组织，这就是说，它们不是普通的文学艺术爱好者的团体。协会应当以组织作家、艺术家的创作和学习作为主要的任务。因此，协会必须组织关于创作问题的广泛的研究和讨论，组织艺术作品或表演的相互观摩和自由竞赛；开展文艺战线上的原则性的批评和自我批评；组织作家、艺术家对马克思列宁主义理论以及党和政府的政策的学习；按照各个作家不同情况，组织他们去参加各方面的实际的群众生活和群众斗争。新的章程草案规定了对古典文学艺术遗产，特别是民族遗产的学习的任务。改组后的协会应当更多地吸收古典文学研究者、民族戏曲家、民族画家、民族音乐家做会员，并参加领导的机构。这次大会已有不少这些方面的代表参加，这就表明人民的新的文学艺术的队伍是比第一次文代大会的时候更扩大了。“旧艺人”“旧画家”等等名称将成为过去。指导文学艺术普及工作，培养青年作家、艺术家，列为协会的重要任务。作家协会所举办的文学讲习所及各种文艺刊物，应成为培养青年作家的有力的工具。
    几年来，各省、市的文联，在组织当地文艺工作者进行创作和各种配合中心任务的文艺宣传以及辅导群众业余艺术活动上做了不少工作，是有成绩的。过去，省、市文联的方针任务是不明确的。今后应当规定，它们的性质不是团体联合会，而是当地文学艺术工作者综合性的、自愿的组织；它的成员应包括文学、戏剧、音乐、美术等各方面的文艺工作者。这样，在省、市，另外就不需要再分设各种协会了。为了使省、市文联成为真正组织当地文艺工作者从事文艺活动的有效的团体，它的会员也需要有一定的标准，而不应漫无限制地滥收。
    省、市文联既然是以个人为会员的当地文艺工作者的组织，它的主要任务就必须是组织自己的会员从事文艺创作以开展当地的文艺活动。现在，好些省、市文联都设有专业的创作组，这在有比较成熟的创作人员的地方，不失为一种可行的过渡的办法。但省、市文联组织创作的对象不能只限于创作组，而对其他的创作力量弃置不顾，它必须给予一切具有创作能力的会员以应有的帮助。
    辅导群众的业余艺术活动，是省、市文联的另一个主要的任务。这种辅导应当侧重于供应群众业余艺术活动的材料和指导群众的创作这两方面，以便和政府文化主管部门的工作互相配合而不互相重复。
    地方的文艺刊物应当成为发现和培养当地青年作家，供给群众通俗文艺读物，供给群众业余艺术演唱材料的有效的工具。
    关于这次大会所要解决的创作方面和组织方面的任务，我就讲了上面的这些意见，希望代表同志们加以考虑和研究。我相信，经过这次大会之后，我们的文学艺术的创造事业必将获得新的发展和繁荣。
