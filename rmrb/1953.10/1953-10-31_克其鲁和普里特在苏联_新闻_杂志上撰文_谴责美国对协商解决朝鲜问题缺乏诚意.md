    Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: The latest issue of the Soviet magazine "News", under the heading "Voice of Peace Advocates", published an article by Kitchlew, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council. In the article, Kitchlew said: "The Korean question can only be peacefully resolved through a political conference attended not only by the belligerent countries but also by neutral countries, especially other Asian countries. The recent session of the United Nations General Assembly shows that the United States is setting conditions and excluding countries like India, which have played an important role in achieving peace in Korea, in order to obstruct peace.
    The separate treaty concluded by the United States and Syngman Rhee shows that it is not sincere in seeking a peaceful resolution of the Korean question through negotiations in Korea. The United States is also preventing the People's Republic of China from obtaining its legitimate seat in the United Nations in order to obstruct peace. Without the participation of China, it is impossible to solve major international problems or establish peace."
    Under the same heading, "News" magazine also published an article by Pritt, Chairman of the British Peace Committee. Pritt said in his article: The United States government is attempting to force the United Nations and Europe and Asia to accept its interpretation of the word "negotiation." "This is where one party to the negotiation attempts to stipulate conditions or present faits accomplis to the parties participating in the negotiation before the negotiation begins, and such conditions or faits accomplis will make sincere negotiation impossible. This is the recent policy of the United States: on the one hand, it is negotiating on the Korean question, and on the other hand, it is concluding a separate treaty with Syngman Rhee, wanting to resume the war at the agreed time during the negotiations; this is the policy of demanding that the Soviet Union accept conditions that would revive German militarism before negotiations on the German question begin; this is the policy of depriving the People's Republic of China of its legitimate status in the United Nations. This policy is completely contrary to the spirit of conducting sincere negotiations. To conduct sincere negotiations, all parties must hold a meeting with the desire to reach a practical solution acceptable to all."

    克其鲁和普里特在苏联“新闻”杂志上撰文
    谴责美国对协商解决朝鲜问题缺乏诚意
    【新华社二十九日讯】最近一期的苏联“新闻”杂志在“和平拥护者的呼声”标题下刊载了全印和平理事会主席克其鲁的一篇文章。克其鲁在文章中说：“只有政治会议不仅有交战国并且有中立国，特别是其他亚洲国家的参加，朝鲜问题才可能和平解决。联合国大会最近的会议表明：美国正提出条件，并排斥像印度这样在实现朝鲜和平方面起了重要作用的国家，以阻挠和平。
    美国和李承晚缔结单独条约，这说明它在朝鲜进行谈判，并不是真诚地要使朝鲜问题得到和平解决。美国并且不让中华人民共和国在联合国取得它的合法地位，以便阻挠和平。没有中国的参加，要解决主要国际问题或建立和平是不可能的。”
    “新闻”杂志在同一标题下也刊载了英国和平委员会会长普里特的文章。普里特在文章中说：美国政府正企图强使联合国及欧洲和亚洲接受它对“协商”一词的解释。“这就是在协商开始以前，协商的一方企图规定条件，或向参加协商的各方提出既成的事实，而这种条件或既成事实是会使诚意的协商无法进行的。这就是美国最近的政策：一方面进行朝鲜问题的谈判，一方面又与李承晚缔结单独条约，要在谈判期间的约定的时候恢复战争；这就是在关于德国问题的谈判开始以前要苏联接受会使德国军国主义复活的条件的政策；这就是剥夺中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位的政策。这种政策是完全违反进行诚意协商的精神的。要进行诚意协商，各方必须抱着获致大家都能接受的实际解决办法的愿望来举行会议。”
