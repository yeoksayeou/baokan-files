To the Working People of the World

Working men and women, manual and intellectual laborers of all countries! We are from seventy-nine countries attending the Third World Trade Union Congress. We represent 88,600,000 organized manual and intellectual laborers of all races, nationalities, political beliefs, and religious views. This grand international trade union gathering is of the utmost significance in the history of the labor movement. At the meeting, we discussed our demands and struggles, our plans and hopes.

    At the same time, we democratically formulated and adopted a program of struggle that reflects the aspirations of all working people for happiness and peace.

    In those countries still under the oppression of big capitalists, the masses of working people are unwilling to live in poverty any longer, unwilling to suffer from suspicion, hunger, unemployment, enslavement, and the danger of war. They are uniting to fight for better living conditions, to defend their rights, and to safeguard lasting peace. In France and Italy, millions of working people have united to hold strikes, the persistence and scale of which are unprecedented. Millions of British workers are now demanding higher wages. Mass strikes have also taken place in countries such as India, Brazil, and Iran. In vast areas of Africa, the united struggle of the working people has forced the colonizers to implement labor laws. The struggle against racial discrimination is spreading throughout Africa. In capitalist and colonial countries, such as the United States, Japan, Greece, and Spain, in Indonesia and Morocco, and in various countries in the Middle East and Latin America, the tide of the workers' movement is developing day by day.

    In colonial and dependent countries, the national liberation movement is expanding. Ancient Asia, which has been under the oppression of colonizers for a century, is gradually being liberated. A new great power—the People's Republic of China—has been born, and it, together with all peace-loving forces, is jointly defending the great cause of peace, international security, and national independence. The people of Vietnam, Japan, Malaya, Indonesia, the Near East, Africa, and Latin America are fighting heroically for freedom and independence.

    Working men and women of all countries! Improving the living conditions of ordinary people, consolidating world peace, and expanding existing victories depend on yourselves, on your unity, and on your struggle. The tireless struggle of the people of all countries for peace has produced initial results. The bloodshed in Korea has ended. Hundreds of millions of men and women have responded to the World Peace Council's call for the peaceful settlement of all international disputes. However, there are still forces in the world that oppose the easing of international tensions. They do not want peace. In pursuit of maximum profits, they are betting on the continuous deterioration of international tensions and on war. They are remilitarizing West Germany, turning it into the main breeding ground for aggression in Europe. They are plotting to sabotage the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and they are fostering Japan's military strength, making it the main military base in the Far East. They are attacking the living standards of the working class. They are accelerating the arms race, making the burden on the working masses heavier and heavier.

    The Third World Trade Union Congress shows that we can unite all working men and women, unite all factions of trade unions, and fight together to raise wages, reduce taxes, eliminate unemployment, and implement the principle of equal pay for equal work regardless of gender, age, race, or nationality, to fight for the abolition of superhuman labor intensity and the widespread implementation of social insurance systems, to fight for the abolition of anti-labor laws and the protection of trade union rights, to fight for the reduction of military budgets and the investment of the funds saved into the peaceful use of economic and cultural development, and to fight for the United Nations to abide by the United Nations Charter and restore its original role and function of promoting peaceful cooperation among the people of all countries.

    The idea of unity is being grasped by the masses more and more widely. The working people are increasingly eager to establish trade union unity at the enterprise, national, and international levels. The restoration of international trade union unity will be of great significance. This unity will promote the further easing of international tensions and curb the arms race. This unity will have a good influence on the development of friendly economic and cultural ties between countries with different social systems. This unity will help increase peaceful production, reduce unemployment, and improve the welfare of the people.

    Working men and women of all trades in all countries! Let us not forget the painful lessons of World War II! Let us strengthen the unity of our ranks! Let us restore the national and international working-class unity! Let us build this unity in every enterprise and institution, building a united front to defend workers' demands! Expose the divisive policies of those like the heads of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations who attempt to hinder this unity! We call on every trade union organization and the leading bodies of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" to adopt the World Federation of Trade Unions' proposals for concerted action!

    Long live the unbreakable unity of the working people of the world!
    Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions, which is actively and unremittingly fighting for lasting peace, friendship between the people of all countries, and a bright future for all mankind! (Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 22nd, from TASS)

    告世界劳动人民书
    各国男女工人们，体力劳动者和脑力劳动者们！我们是来自七十九个国家出席世界工会第三次代表大会的。我们代表着八千八百六十万各种族、各民族、各种政治信仰和各种宗教观点的有组织的体力和脑力劳动者。这次盛大的国际工会集会在工人运动史上是具有最重大意义的，我们在会上讨论了我们的要求和斗争，我们的计划和希望。
    同时，我们用民主的方式制订并通过了斗争纲领，它反映了渴望幸福与和平的全体劳动人民的意愿。
    在那些仍处于大资本家压迫之下的国家内，劳动人民群众不愿再过贫困的生活，不愿再受猜疑、饥饿、失业、奴役和战争危险的苦难。他们正在联合起来，为改善生存条件、为维护自己的权利、为保卫持久和平而斗争。在法国和意大利，数以百万计的劳动人民团结一致地举行了罢工，罢工的持久性和规模是空前的。数以百万计的英国工人现在正在要求提高工资。在印度、巴西和伊朗等国也举行了具有广大群众性的罢工。在非洲的广大地区，劳动人民的统一斗争迫使殖民者实施了劳动法。反对种族歧视的斗争遍及整个非洲。在资本主义和殖民地国家内，如在美国，日本，希腊和西班牙，在印度尼西亚和摩洛哥，在中东和拉丁美洲各个国家内，工人运动的浪潮日见发展。
    在殖民地和附属国家内，民族解放运动日益扩大。一百年来处于殖民者压迫之下的古老的亚洲逐渐获得解放。一个新的伟大的强国——中华人民共和国诞生了，它和一切爱好和平的力量一道，共同捍卫着和平、国际安全和民族独立的伟大事业。越南、日本、马来亚、印度尼西亚、近东、非洲和拉丁美洲的人民正在为争取自由和独立而英勇斗争。
    各国男女劳动者们！要改善普通人民的生活条件，巩固世界和平，扩大已有的胜利，全靠你们自己，靠你们的团结，靠你们的斗争。各国人民争取和平的不倦的斗争已经产生了初步的成果。朝鲜的流血结束了。亿万男女人民响应世界和平理事会关于和平解决一切国际争端的号召。但是，世界上仍然存在着反对缓和国际紧张局势的势力。他们不要和平。为了追求最大限度的利润，他们把赌注押在国际紧张局势不断恶化上，押在战争上。他们正在使西德重新军国主义化，把西德变为在欧洲的主要侵略温床。他们正在阴谋破坏和平解决朝鲜问题，他们正在扶植日本的军事力量，使它成为远东的主要军事基地。他们正在进攻工人阶级的生活水平。他们正在加速军备竞赛，使劳动群众的负担愈来愈重。
    世界工会第三次代表大会表明，我们能够把所有的男女劳动者联合起来，把各派工会联合起来，共同为提高工资、减轻赋税、消灭失业而斗争，为实行不分性别、年龄、种族和民族的同工同酬的原则而斗争，为取消超乎人力的劳动强度、广泛实施社会保险制度而斗争，为废除反劳工法、保障工会权利而斗争，为削减军事预算、把削减出来的资金投到发展经济和文化的和平用途上去而斗争，为使联合国遵守联合国宪章，恢复它原来的促进各国人民之间和平合作这样的作用和职能而斗争。
    团结的思想正日见广泛地掌握着群众。劳动人民日益迫切地希望建立起企业中的、全国和国际规模的工会团结。国际工会团结的恢复将具有非常重大的意义。这种团结将促使国际紧张局势进一步缓和，制止军备竞赛。这种团结将对社会制度不同的国家之间经济和文化友好联系的发展发生良好的影响。这种团结将有助于提高和平生产、减少失业和增进人民的福利。
    各国的各业男女劳动者们！我们不要忘记第二次世界大战的惨痛教训！让我们加强我们队伍的团结！让我们恢复全国的和国际的工人阶级团结！让我们在每一个企业和机关内建立起这种团结，建立一个维护工人要求的统一战线！揭露像美国劳联和产联的头子之流企图阻碍这种团结的分裂政策！我们要求每一个工会组织和“国际自由工会联合会”的领导机构采纳世界工联关于一致行动的建议！
    全世界劳动人民牢不可破的团结万岁！
    为持久和平、各国人民之间的友谊、全人类光明未来而积极不懈地斗争的世界工会联合会万岁！（新华社据塔斯社维也纳二十二日讯）
