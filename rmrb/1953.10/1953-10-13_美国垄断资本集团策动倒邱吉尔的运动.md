Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 12th dispatch:
	Reports from here indicate that a movement to oust Churchill and suppress the growing anti-American sentiment within Britain, orchestrated behind the scenes by the United States, has been underway for some time.

	The Paris-based weekly "Nation Forum" recently published an article commenting on the once-widespread rumors of Churchill's impending retirement due to "health conditions." Despite official British denials, these rumors continue to circulate. According to "semi-official investigations," the publication reported: "The source of this movement is the U.S. Embassy in London, and Ambassador Aldrich is personally leading it." Aldrich is a key figure in the U.S. Rockefeller financial group, formerly chairman of Chase Bank. Eisenhower appointed him as the U.S. Ambassador to Britain to strengthen "ties" between the two countries.

	For quite some time, U.S. monopoly capital groups have expressed increasing impatience with their British "allies." They believe that their British "comrades" are becoming increasingly independent and even daring to display ambitions to compete with the United States for leadership in the capitalist world. In this regard, Churchill's speech on May 11th particularly infuriated U.S. monopoly capital groups. That speech supported the idea of holding a summit meeting between major powers without preconditions to negotiate solutions to international problems. This proposal sparked widespread responses in capitalist countries. At the time, reports suggested that this speech was a step by Churchill to seize diplomatic initiative from the United States.

	"Nation Forum" weekly stated that Aldrich returned to the United States in July this year and met with key figures of U.S. financial groups such as Ford Jr. and Rockefeller, to discuss the economic relations between the United States and Britain. These individuals were "extremely dissatisfied" with Churchill's May 11th speech. The publication continued: "After Aldrich returned to London, he held several meetings of intelligence personnel at the U.S. Embassy. Subsequently, the first sensational articles about Churchill's serious illness immediately appeared in the British press. Some British individuals dependent on American companies were instructed to participate in this movement, and some pro-American organizations such as 'Common Cause,' some journalists, and many Italian and West German representatives stationed in Britain also participated." According to the publication, the initial goal of the entire plan determined by the U.S. State Department was to force Churchill to step down before the Queen of England departed for Commonwealth countries this autumn.

	Meanwhile, a London dispatch published in the Swedish "New Daily" stated: "The U.S. attitude towards solving the Korean problem and other international issues is increasingly contradictory to the official British viewpoint. American diplomats are beginning to take measures to suppress anti-American sentiment among the British as much as possible."

	The report pointed out that the United States is strengthening its activities through various pro-American organizations in Britain that receive subsidies from U.S. monopoly capital, to attack anti-American figures and spread pro-American ideas. Among these organizations are the so-called "Educational Group" propaganda bureau established earlier this year and the so-called "Common Cause" organization. They compile "blacklists" of anti-American figures, study anti-American sentiments, and use spreading rumors, slander, and other methods to attack those who do not meet Washington's wishes.

### 美国垄断资本集团策动倒邱吉尔的运动

    美国垄断资本集团策动倒邱吉尔的运动
    【新华社十二日讯】巴黎消息：这里有消息说，一个倒邱吉尔台和压制英国国内日益强烈的反美情绪的运动，在美国幕后策动下已进行了一个时期。
    巴黎的“民族论坛”周刊不久前发表一篇文章，评论曾经盛传一时的关于邱吉尔因为“健康状况”将告退休的传说。尽管英国官方辟谣，这种传说仍不断散布开来。该刊根据“半官方的调查”报道说：“这一运动的来源是美国驻伦敦大使馆，并且阿尔德里奇大使亲自领导着这一运动。”阿尔德里奇是美国洛克菲勒财团的要人，原任美国大通银行董事长。艾森豪威尔派他为驻英大使，以加强两国的“联系”。
    相当一个时期以来，美国垄断资本集团对它们的英国“盟友”表现愈来愈按捺不住的恼怒。它们认为，英国“伙计”是愈来愈自作主张了，并且竟敢表现与美国争夺资本主义世界领导地位的野心。在这方面，特别使美国垄断资本集团感到震怒的是邱吉尔五月十一日的演说。那篇演说支持了大国间举行不受先决条件约束的元首会议以协商解决国际间问题的主张。这个主张在资本主义各国引起了广泛的呼应。当时有消息说，这篇演说是邱吉尔从美国手中夺取外交主动的一个步骤。
    “民族论坛”周刊说，阿尔德里奇今年七月间曾经返美，与美国重要财团首脑如小福特、洛克菲勒等人会过面，讨论了美国和英国的经济关系问题，这些人对邱吉尔五月十一日的演说“都极为不满”。该刊接着说：“阿尔德里奇回到伦敦后，在美国大使馆举行了若干次情报人员会议。此后，在英国报刊上立刻就出现了关于邱吉尔重病的第一批轰动一时的文章。一些依赖美国公司的英国人士曾被授意参加这一运动，某些‘共同事业’之类的亲美组织、若干记者以及驻英国的许多意大利与西德的代表也参加了这一运动。”据该刊说，美国国务院整套计划当初确定的目的，是力求使邱吉尔在今年秋天英女王启程到英联邦各国去之前下台。
    同时，这里收到的瑞典的“新日报”刊载一篇伦敦通讯说：“美国对解决朝鲜问题及其他国际问题的态度愈益与英国官方的观点矛盾。美国外交家开始采取尽可能压制英国人反美情绪的措施。”
    该报指出，美国正通过英国各种接受美国垄断资本津贴的亲美组织来加强活动，打击反美的人物并散布亲美思想。在这些组织中有今年初成立的所谓“教育组”宣传局和所谓“共同事业”组织。它们编制反美人士的“黑名单”，研究反美情绪，并用散布谣言、诽谤以及其他等等办法打击那些不合乎华盛顿心意的人。
