Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 10th: Our special correspondent reports on the U.S. side's conspiracy and delaying tactics in the construction of explanation facilities: Although the U.S. side, under repeated urging from the Korean-Chinese side and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC), had to state at the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 7th that "construction is currently underway as requested," it is in fact still implementing a delaying policy. According to civilian police in our non-military zone north of Dongchang-ri, at the time when Brougher said this, there was not a single person moving on the highlands near Dongchang-ri. It was not until noon on the 8th, the day after Brougher said "construction is currently underway as requested," that bulldozers were seen slowly "dragging their feet" there.

In view of this situation, the NNRC requested on the 8th that the U.S. side complete the construction of permanent explanation facilities within four days, otherwise the Korean-Chinese side would complete them on schedule. However, today the U.S. side did not give a clear, affirmative, and responsible answer to the NNRC's firm demand, but vaguely replied that temporary facilities would be completed in five days with the help of Indian troops, and permanent facilities would be completed "as soon as possible." This shows that the U.S. side has not changed its attitude of delay.

The U.S. side's attitude towards the construction of explanation facilities and the delay in building new explanation facilities contains a vicious conspiracy to fundamentally undermine the explanation work. Because:

First, the location of the explanation facilities originally built by the U.S. side was very close to the southern edge of the demilitarized zone, very close to the U.S. military control area. This is the U.S. side's attempt to continue to maintain threats and influence over the prisoners of war with its military power, and to facilitate the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee secret agents mixed in with the prisoners of war to take the opportunity to kidnap the prisoners of war and run to the U.S. military control area during the explanation, repeating the action of Syngman Rhee's "release" of 27,000 prisoners of war in June this year, which violated the armistice agreement.

Second, the design of the explanation site originally built by the U.S. side did not prepare two exits separately for the prisoners of war who had applied for repatriation after explanation and the prisoners of war who had not yet applied for repatriation, but only one exit, only one passage, and the prisoners of war who had applied for repatriation had to pass through the gate of the compound of the prisoners of war who had not applied for repatriation before entering the compound prepared for them. This facilitated the secret agents standing at the gate of the compound of the prisoners of war who had not applied for repatriation, blocking the way with threats, and even using violence.

According to Article 21 of the "Rules of Procedure for Explanation and Interview Work" passed by the NNRC: "Each compound for individual or collective explanation shall have two exits for the prisoners of war to use separately: one for those who apply for repatriation and the other for those who do not apply for repatriation." The U.S. side's obvious violation of this provision is clearly aimed at preventing the prisoners of war from escaping the control of secret agents and from freely exercising their right to repatriation. According to the Korean and Chinese captured personnel who have returned, the U.S. side used a similar method in the illegal and bloody "screening" on Geoje Island in April last year. Some prisoners of war who boldly requested repatriation were forcibly dragged away by secret agents after leaving the U.S. interrogation tents and became the so-called "refusal to repatriate" people in the current Indian camp.

Third, the environment of the explanation site makes the explanation work vulnerable to various interferences. For example, the explanation site is less than 200 meters away from the nearby prisoner of war camp; the explanation tent is only separated from the compound of the prisoners of war who have not yet applied for repatriation by a wire mesh hanging with cloth; and all the explanation tents are densely packed together, which facilitates the secret agents to coerce the prisoners of war to interfere with the explanation work by using musical instruments, shouting, etc., so that the prisoners of war receiving the explanation are still threatened by the secret agents.

When the U.S. side was building according to the above-mentioned sinister design, the representatives of the Korean and Chinese sides went to inspect it and suggested to the NNRC on September 28th that the location of the explanation site should be set near the military demarcation line in Dongchang-ri, and put forward their own reasonable design to avoid the U.S. military power threatening and influencing the prisoners of war, so that the prisoners of war have the opportunity to freely express their willingness to repatriate. The NNRC unanimously agreed to this reasonable suggestion of the Korean and Chinese sides at the meeting on the same day (September 28th) and asked the U.S. side to build it accordingly. However, the U.S. side, which should be responsible for the construction according to the armistice agreement, put forward various false and absurd excuses and deliberately delayed the construction.

The U.S. side said that there are landmines in the Dongchang-ri area designated by the Korean and Chinese sides. However, according to Subparagraph 13 of Article 2 of the armistice agreement, all known explosives, minefields, etc. existing in the demilitarized zone shall be cleared from the demilitarized zone within 48 days after the signing of the armistice. Brougher had already stated at the Military Armistice Commission on September 16th that the U.S. side had cleared this dangerous object. Now the U.S. side says that there are landmines in the place where the explanation site is to be built in the Dongchang-ri demilitarized zone. People cannot help but ask: Since the U.S. side knew that there were landmines there, but did not clear them within the prescribed time limit, isn't this a deliberate violation of the armistice agreement? Now the U.S. side is trying to use this violation of the armistice agreement as an excuse to obstruct the construction of the explanation site, isn't this an even more intolerable violation of the armistice agreement?

The U.S. side also said that Dongchang-ri is low-lying and humid, and the project will take six to eight weeks. However, the result of the on-site inspection by the representatives of the Korean and Chinese sides and the personnel of the NNRC exposed the U.S. side's untrue evasion and proved that there are enough highlands near the area for construction.

When these excuses could not be established, the U.S. side openly denied its obligations under the armistice agreement and the scope of authority of the NNRC on October 4th, claiming that the U.S. side "makes no commitment" as to whether it is willing to carry out the construction of explanation facilities suggested by the Korean and Chinese sides, and stated that the temporary facilities for explanation would be completed within seven days from the date of approval of construction by the "United Nations Command," and the two sets of permanent explanation facilities, each consisting of sixteen explanation tents, would be completed successively within 20 to 30 days from the date of approval.

The U.S. side's need for such a long time to build the explanation site is unfounded. The U.S. side once publicly said that it completed the construction of the management camp to accommodate 23,000 prisoners of war in two or three weeks, but now it takes four weeks and two days to build the explanation site that can only accommodate 500 prisoners of war, and the materials needed are only bulldozers, wood, tents, wire mesh, etc. This is obviously another false excuse for the U.S. side to delay the construction of explanation facilities. Contrary to the U.S. side's delaying policy, on the same day (October 4th) when the U.S. side believed that it would take a long time to complete the construction of the Dongchang-ri explanation facilities, the Korean and Chinese sides had completed the construction of all permanent explanation facilities in the Songgok-ri camp in the northern part of the demilitarized zone according to the location and design proposed by the U.S. side, and the construction time was only two days.

On the morning of October 5th, the Korean and Chinese sides formally handed over all the permanent explanation sites built for the U.S. side to the NNRC for takeover. Chairman Thimayya of the NNRC also wrote a letter urging the U.S. side, asking the U.S. side to immediately start building the "extremely urgent" explanation facilities; and told the U.S. side that the Korean and Chinese sides had expressed their willingness to provide the NNRC with all necessary assistance to complete the construction of the permanent explanation facilities that the U.S. side had repeatedly delayed in four days, and to complete the construction of the temporary facilities in two days. Under this circumstance, the U.S. side's various excuses for delaying the construction of explanation facilities and obstructing the rapid start of explanation work are no longer tenable. Brougher had no choice but to say at the Military Armistice Commission on October 7th that "construction is currently underway," but he also distorted the facts and blamed the delay on the NNRC. He said: "It was not until 23:00 on October 5th that the NNRC put forward a firm request for the explanation site." But everyone knows clearly that as early as September 28th, the NNRC asked the U.S. side to build permanent explanation facilities near Dongchang-ri, but the U.S. side refused to build them on September 29th under the pretext that the area was low-lying, humid and buried with landmines. The U.S. side's responsibility for delaying the construction of explanation facilities and obstructing the start of explanation work cannot be completely escaped.

People must pay serious attention: the U.S. side's conspiracy and delaying policy in the construction of explanation facilities is only part of its overall plan to undermine the explanation work and undermine the "scope of authority of the NNRC." On the one hand, it is delaying the date of the start of explanation, and on the other hand, it is arrogantly infringing on the authority of the NNRC and opposing the extension of the explanation period. The U.S. side's purpose is to hinder the prisoners of war from meeting with our explanation representatives, and even to try to make the explanation work impossible at all, in order to realize its final conspiracy to forcibly detain the prisoners of war.

    美方修建解释设备的恶毒设计和拖延政策
    暴露美方阻挠解释工作扣留战俘的阴谋
    【新华社开城十日电】    本社特派记者报道美方在修建解释设备问题上的阴谋和拖延政策说：虽然在朝中方面和中立国遣返委员会再三催促下，美方不得不在七日的军事停战委员会会议上表示“目前正在按照要求进行建筑中”，但事实上它还是在执行拖延政策。据东场里以北我方非军事区的民政警察目睹：在勃里安说这个话的时候，东场里附近高地上根本没有一个人走动。直到八日中午，即勃里安说了“目前正在按照要求进行建筑中”以后的第二天中午，才见到有推土机慢吞吞地在那里“磨洋工”。
    鉴于这种情况，中立国遣返委员会曾于八日要求美方在四天内完成永久性解释设备的修建，否则即由朝中方面按期修成。但是，美方今天对中立国遣返委员会的坚决要求不予明确、肯定、负责的答复，而含糊其辞地答称：在印度部队帮助下五天内完成临时性设备，永久性设备“尽快地”完成。这说明美方并未改变拖延的态度。
    美方对修建解释设备以及拖延新的解释设备的修建，是包含着企图从根本上破坏解释工作的恶毒阴谋的。因为：
    第一，美方原来修建的解释设备的地点，紧靠着非军事区南缘，离美方军事控制地区很近。这是美方企图以其军事力量继续对战俘保持威胁和影响，并便于混在战俘中的蒋李特务分子在解释时乘机挟持战俘跑到美方军事控制地区去，重演今年六月李承晚“释放”二万七千名战俘的破坏停战协定的行动。
    第二，美方原来修建的解释场所的设计，并没有给经解释后已申请遣返的战俘和尚未申请遣返的战俘分别准备两个出口，而是只有一个出口，只有一个通道，而且已申请遣返的战俘必须经过未申请遣返战俘围场的门口，才能进入为他们准备的围场。这就便利于特务分子站在未申请遣返战俘围场门口，拦路威胁，甚至使用暴力。
    根据中立国遣返委员会通过的“解释和访问工作细则”第二十一款规定：“进行个别或集体解释的每一围场，应有两个给战俘分别使用的出口：一由申请遣返者用，另一由不申请遣返者用。”美方对于这一规定的明显违反，其目的显然是使战俘不能摆脱特务分子的控制，不能自由行使其遣返的权利。据已归来的朝中被俘人员说，美方在去年四月巨济岛上的非法血腥“甄别”中就曾使用过类似的方法，有些大胆要求遣返的战俘走出美方的审问帐篷以后，就被特务强行拖走，成了现在印度营地中所谓“拒绝遣返”的人。
    第三，解释场所的环境使解释工作易受各种干扰。例如解释场所与附近战俘营场相距不到二百公尺；解释帐篷与尚未申请遣返的战俘围场仅隔着一层挂着布幕的铁丝网；而所有的解释帐篷则又密集在一起，这就便于特务分子胁持战俘用敲打乐器、叫嚷等手段干扰解释工作，使接受解释的战俘仍然受到特务的威胁。
    当美方正按上述险恶设计进行修建时，朝中方面代表曾前往进行了视察，并在九月二十八日向中立国遣返委员会建议把解释场所的地点设在东场里附近靠近军事分界线的地方，并提出自己合理的设计，以避免美方军事力量威胁和影响战俘，使战俘有自由表达遣返意愿的机会。对朝中方面这个合理的建议，中立国遣返委员会在当天（二十八日）的会议上就一致表示同意，并要求美方照此予以修建。但根据停战协定应负修建之责的美方，却提出种种虚假而荒谬的藉口，故意拖延修建。
    美方说，朝中方面指定的东场里地区有地雷。但根据停战协定第二条第十三款子项规定，所有知悉存在于非军事区内的爆破物、地雷阵地等均应在停战签订后的四十八天内自非军事区清除。勃里安早在九月十六日军事停战委员会上即曾表示美方已将此项危险物清除。现在美方说在东场里非军事区要修建解释场所的地方有地雷。人们不能不提出质问：美方既然知道那里有地雷，而又不在规定时限内予以清除，这不是明知故犯地违反停战协定吗？现在美方又企图以这种违反停战协定的行为作为阻挠解释场所修建的藉口，这不是更加令人不能容忍的又一次违反停战协定的行为吗？
    美方还说，东场里地势低洼、潮湿，工程需时六个到八个星期。但是，朝中方面代表与中立国遣返委员会人员亲往现场视察的结果，揭穿了美方不符事实的遁辞，证明该地附近有足够的高地可供修建之用。
    当这些藉口都不能成立时，美方在十月四日竟公然否认它对停战协定及中立国遣返委员会的职权范围所负的义务，声称：美方是否愿意进行朝中方面所建议的修建解释设备“不作任何承诺”，并表示供解释用的临时设备要在“联合国军”批准修建的日期起七天内才能完成，而分为十六个解释帐篷为一组的两组永久性解释设备，则需要从批准日期起先后在二十天至三十天内完成。
    美方需要这样长的时间来修建解释场所是毫无根据的。美方曾公开说，它在两三个星期内就将容纳二万三千名战俘的看管营场修建完成，而现在为了修建仅容纳五百名战俘的解释场所，所需材料也仅是推土机、木料、帐篷、铁丝网等，反而需要四个星期另二天之多的时间，这很明显地是美方拖延解释设备修建的又一虚假藉口。与美方的拖延政策相反，就在美方认为需要很长时间才能完成修建东场里解释设备的同一天（十月四日），朝中方面已按照美方提出的地点和设计，把非军事区北部松谷里营地的永久性解释设备全部修建完成，修建时间只有两天。
    十月五日上午，朝中方面已将修建供美方使用的全部永久性解释场所正式移交给中立国遣返委员会接管。中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅又写信催促美方，要求美方立即开始修建“极为紧迫”需要的解释设备；并告诉美方：朝中方面已表示愿意向中立国遣返委员会提供一切必要的协助，在四天内完成美方一再拖延的永久性解释设备的修建，在两天内完成临时设备的修建。在此情况下，美方拖延解释设备的修建，阻挠解释工作迅速开始的种种藉口再也站不住脚了。勃里安才不得不在十月七日的军事停战委员会上表示“目前正在进行建筑中”，但还歪曲事实地把拖延的责任推给中立国遣返委员会。他说：“直到十月五日二十三时的时候，中立国遣返委员会才提出了对解释场所的坚决要求。”但人们都清楚地知道，早在九月二十八日，中立国遣返委员会就要求美方在东场里附近修建永久性解释设备，而美方却在九月二十九日以该地地势低洼，潮湿与埋有地雷等藉口拒不修建。美方拖延修建解释设备、阻挠解释工作开始的责任是完全逃避不了的。
    人们必须严重注意：美方在修建解释设备上的阴谋和拖延政策还只是它破坏解释工作、破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的总计划的一部分。它一方面在拖延解释开始的日期，一方面蛮横地侵犯中立国遣返委员会的职权，反对解释期的顺延。美方目的是阻难战俘与我方解释代表见面，甚至企图使解释工作根本不能进行，以实现它最后强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。
