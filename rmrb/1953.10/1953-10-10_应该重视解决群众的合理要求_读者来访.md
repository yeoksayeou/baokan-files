    We Should Attach Importance to Solving the Reasonable Demands of the Masses
    —Reader's Visit
    Editor's Note: Chen Wenhe, a farmer from Xiaxishi Village, Second District, Shunyi County, Hebei Province, came to the reader's letter group of this newspaper to expose the dilatory work of the Tongxian Special District Finance Section and the Shunyi County People's Government Finance and Food Section, which caused his mule compensation issue to be unresolved for two or three years. After we inquired with the Tongxian Special District Finance Section, it was proven that the situation was true. Now, the Tongxian Special District Finance Section has decided to send someone to cooperate with the Shunyi County People's Government Finance and Food Section to go to Xiaxishi Village for appropriate handling. We believe that this handling is completely correct. However, there are still some agencies that adopt a dilatory attitude towards the reasonable demands of the masses. They should learn a lesson from this matter, earnestly attach importance to the reasonable demands of the masses, and correct the dilatory style in their work. The following is a record of Chen Wenhe's conversation:
    In 1949, when the People's Liberation Army went south, my family had a mule that died on the road due to military transport in support of the front lines. At that time, Gao Qingxian, the finance and food assistant of the district (my village belonged to the Sixth District of Changping-Shunyi County), issued a certificate stating that the dead mule was worth 2,290 jin of millet. In October 1949, my village was assigned to the Eleventh District of Shunyi County (later reassigned to the Second District), and I registered with the Eleventh District People's Government, waiting for the government to handle it; but there was no news. By December 1950, the county convened a People's Representative Conference of all circles, and the representatives put forward a proposal to compensate the masses for the losses they suffered while supporting the front lines; the government replied: As long as there is proof, compensation can be made in full. However, there was still no news afterward. I also wrote to the Hebei Daily. The Hebei Daily forwarded my letter to the Shunyi County People's Government Finance and Food Section for prompt handling. By March 1951, the Finance and Food Section asked me to take the certificate for verification. At that time, the Finance and Food Section accepted the certificate, exchanged it for a receipt, and then asked me to go home and wait for news. By the end of March 1952, there was still no information. I went to the section to ask again. The section checked the files and found that they had kept my certificate for a year without reporting it. After that, they reported the matter to the Tongxian Special District Finance Section. A year later, in March of this year, I went to the section again and asked: Will the mule be compensated or not? The section replied that the Special District Finance Section had not approved it yet, and being anxious would not help. The problem has still not been resolved until now.
    The Tongxian Special District Finance Section and the Shunyi County Finance and Food Section are procrastinating and perfunctory, and irresponsible, which is really unbearable. This problem cannot be delayed any longer! I demand that they correct this bureaucratic style and quickly resolve my mule compensation issue.

### 应该重视解决群众的合理要求——读者来访

专栏：读者来信摘要

    应该重视解决群众的合理要求
    ——读者来访
    编者按：河北省顺义县二区下西市村农民陈文和到本报读者来信组来，揭发通县专署财政科和顺义县人民政府财粮科等单位办事拖拉，使他的骡子赔偿问题拖了两三年还得不到解决。经我们向通县专署财政科查问，证明情况属实。现通县专署财政科已决定派人协同顺义县人民政府财粮科亲到下西市村进行适当处理。我们认为这样处理是完全应该的。但是，目前还有一些机关对群众的合理要求采取拖拉的态度。他们应该从这件事情中吸取教训，切实重视群众的合理要求，纠正工作中的拖拉作风。下面发表的，就是陈文和的谈话记要：
    一九四九年人民解放军南下，我家有一头骡子因为随军运输支援前线，死在路上。当时，区（我村属昌（平）顺（义）县六区）财粮助理员高庆贤发给一个证明文件，注明死骡值二千二百九十斤小米。一九四九年十月，我村划归顺义县十一区（后来又划归二区），我就在十一区人民政府登记，等候政府处理；但是一直没有消息。到一九五○年十二月，县召开各界人民代表会议，代表们提出了赔偿群众支援前线时所受损失的提案；政府答复：只要有证明就可以如数赔偿。可是，以后仍然没有音讯。我又写信问河北日报。河北日报把我的信转请顺义县人民政府财粮科迅速处理。等到一九五一年三月，财粮科叫我拿证明文件去验。当时财粮科收下了证明文件，换给了一张收据，然后叫我回家听信。到了一九五二年三月底还是没信息，我又到该科去问，该科检查底卷，才知道他们把我的证明文件压了一年还没有上报。此后他们才将此事上报通县专署财政科。过了一年，今年三月我又去问该科：到底骡子赔不赔？该科回复说，专署财政科还没有批下来，光急不行。直到现在问题仍然没有解决。
    通县专署财政科和顺义县财粮科拖拉敷衍，不负责任，实在叫人难以忍受。这个问题不能再拖了！我要求他们纠正这种官僚主义作风，迅速解决我的骡子赔偿问题。
