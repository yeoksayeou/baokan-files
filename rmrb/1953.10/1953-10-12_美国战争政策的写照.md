    A Portrait of U.S. War Policy
    Jin Zhiguang

    The results of the U.S. waging the war of aggression against Korea and pursuing a policy of expanding armaments have increasingly widened the contradictions between the countries of the imperialist camp, increasingly isolated the U.S. diplomatically, and at the same time, deepened the economic crisis in Western European countries day by day. The materials revealed in the American "Kiplinger Washington Letter" (a weekly for American small and medium-sized business people) published on June 13 this year are a vivid portrayal of these bad consequences caused by the U.S.'s pursuit of a war policy.

    The U.S. is More Isolated Diplomatically

    This issue of the newsletter begins by depicting the U.S.'s isolation in diplomacy. It says the U.S.'s "foreign relations are shockingly weak," "the U.S. is in front, but it is not leading," and it does not have the ability to lead the imperialist camp. What facts demonstrate this? The newsletter says: First, there are differences of opinion among the countries of the imperialist camp on the Korean issue. If the U.S. were to wage a larger war to "unify" Korea, its allies would not agree. In addition, the U.S. cannot stop its allies from demanding that the People's Republic of China be given its rightful seat in the United Nations; and economic pressure will also force the U.S. to agree to its allies "resuming trade with China." The newsletter admits that the U.S.'s dictatorial actions will become increasingly unworkable among its allies. It says: "Please note: On the vast majority of issues, the U.S. will make concessions, change its position, soften its previously held attitudes, and there will be many compromises."

    The U.S.'s policy of trying to tie its Western European allies to its war chariot with so-called "aid" has also failed. The newsletter sadly says: "American aid is a temptation, not a driving force." All of America's allies are like this: "Their hands are outstretched, but their hearts are not in arming themselves."

    The newsletter also admits the fact that the U.S.'s "Cold War" policy has failed in Europe and Asia. In Europe, this fact has "put the U.S. in the position of a war monger," and many leading figures believe this. And America's Asian allies "do not buy" its leadership because they fear the U.S. will wage a major war in Asia, and they fear that a war in Asia will cause a worldwide war.

    Weakness of Western European Military Strength

    The newsletter also admits that the military strength of Western European countries is much weaker than the U.S. boasts. It says that the European Defense Community is just "a piece of paper" because France fears the strength of West Germany, and West Germany's support for the European Defense Community is only lip service; its main purpose is to use this as a means to obtain U.S. aid.

    It is also not easy for the U.S. to order around its Western European "friends." The newsletter says: Churchill is leading a group of "friendly opposition" in Europe to "restrain the U.S."; Adenauer is an "unskillful second-in-command"; France does not have anyone who can be called a stable ruler; Italy is weak in all aspects, and Gasperi's regime is very unstable. Therefore, the newsletter concludes: "All our allies are 'crippled,' whether militarily, politically, or economically."

    Western Europe's Economic Situation is Particularly Fragile

    The deepening of the U.S. economic crisis has caused widespread fear among its European allies. The newsletter reveals: The problem of the U.S. economic depression is constantly frightening Europeans, which makes them afraid of having any close economic ties with the U.S. In Europe, "even those who are not communists" also "believe that the U.S. economy will inevitably collapse one day." The newsletter describes the current economic situation in Western European countries: in the United Kingdom, the economy is stagnant, productivity is low, and taxes are heavy; in France, finances are chaotic, deficits are increasing, inflation is occurring, and the government is collapsing; Italy is also very poor, and the number of unemployed is large. The newsletter only mentions one country as being so-called "rich and prosperous," and that is Switzerland, the "black market center for wealthy people from various countries" and the "concentration camp for spies." Another serious situation is that Western European countries "want trade, not American aid" and are very angry at the U.S.'s policy of refusing to reduce tariffs; and despite the U.S.'s loud clamoring, it cannot stop Western European trade from turning eastward.

    The People Oppose the U.S.'s War Policy

    While describing the contradictions within the imperialist camp and the weakness and difficulties of the Western European countries, this newsletter cannot but admit that the awareness of the people of Western European countries has greatly increased, and the strength of the people of Western European countries has greatly grown. The newsletter says: The general public in Europe naturally believes that the U.S. is determined to take the path of war. When talking about the recent Italian elections, the newsletter also admits: "The Italian elections showed the people's growing dissatisfaction (with the Gasperi government) and also showed the strength of the Communist Party."

    美国战争政策的写照
    金之光
    美国进行侵朝战争和推行扩张军备政策的结果，已使帝国主义阵营各国之间的矛盾越来越扩大，使美国在外交上越来越陷于孤立，同时，并使西欧各国的经济危机一天天加深。今年六月十三日出版的美国“基普灵格尔氏华盛顿通讯”（专供美国中小企业界人士参考的周刊）中所透露的材料，就是美国推行战争政策所造成的这些恶果的活生生的写照。
    美国在外交上更加孤立
    这期通讯一开头就描绘了美国在外交上的孤立。它说美国“对外关系惊人薄弱”，“美国虽然站在前头，但它并不是在领导”，它没有领导帝国主义阵营的本领。这表现在哪些事实上呢？通讯说：首先是帝国主义阵营各国在朝鲜问题上的意见分歧，如果美国要进行规模更大的战争来“统一”朝鲜的话，它的盟国是不会同意的。此外，美国也无法阻止它的盟国要求使中华人民共和国在联合国中得到应有的席位；而且经济的压力也会迫使美国同意它的盟国“与中国恢复贸易”。通讯承认美国的独断专行在它的盟国中也将越来越行不通了。它说：“请注意：在极大部分的问题上，美国将让步，改变立场，和缓先前所持的态度，屈就的事将会很多。”
    美国打算用所谓“援助”把它的西欧盟国绑上战车的政策也破产了。通讯悲哀地说：“美国的援助是一种诱惑，而不是一种推动力”。所有美国的盟国都是这样：“手是伸着的，但是心却不在于武装自己”。
    通讯也承认美国“冷战”政策在欧洲和亚洲失败的事实。在欧洲，这个事实已经“使美国处于战争贩子的地位”，而且许多首脑人物也都相信这一点。而美国的亚洲盟国对它的领导也“不买账”，因为他们害怕美国在亚洲进行一次大战，而且害怕亚洲的战争会引起全世界的战争。
    西欧军事力量虚弱
    西欧各国军事力量比美国所吹嘘的情况要虚弱得多，通讯也承认这一点。它说欧洲防务集团只是“一纸空文”，因为法国害怕西德的力量，而西德对于欧洲防务集团也只是口头上的支持，它的主要目的是拿这个来当作获得美援的一种手段。
    美国要使唤它的西欧“朋友”也不是得心应手的。通讯说：邱吉尔正在欧洲领导着一个与美国“友善的对立”的集团来“约束美国”；而阿登纳是个“不高明的二把手”；法国没有一个人够得上称为稳定的执政者；意大利在各方面都是软弱的，加斯贝利的政权很不稳固。因此，通讯作出结论说：“所有我们的盟国都是‘残废的’，无论在军事上，在政治上，或在经济上，都是如此。”
    西欧经济情况特别脆弱
    美国经济危机的加深已在它的欧洲盟国中引起普遍的恐惧。通讯透露：美国经济萧条的问题时时刻刻都在使欧洲人害怕，因而使他们害怕与美国有任何紧密的经济关系。在欧洲，“甚至那些不是共产党的人”，也“认为美国的经济总会有一天一定要崩溃的。”通讯描绘了西欧各国目前的经济情况：在英国是经济停滞，生产力低落，赋税重；在法国是财政混乱，赤字增大，通货膨胀，因而政府垮台；意大利也非常穷，失业人数很多。通讯仅仅说到一个国家是所谓“富裕而繁荣”的，那就是“各国阔老们的黑市中心”和“间谍集中地”——瑞士。而另外的严重情况是：一来西欧各国“要贸易，不要美援”，对美国不肯减低关税的政策十分恼怒；二来尽管美国大声叫嚣，也无法阻止西欧的贸易转向东方。
    人民反对美国战争政策
    这篇通讯在叙述了帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾和西欧各国的虚弱和困难的同时，也不得不承认西欧各国人民的觉悟已大大提高了，西欧各国人民的力量已大大增长了。通讯说：欧洲一般人民大都自然而然地认为美国一心要走战争的道路。通讯在谈到不久以前意大利举行的大选时也承认：“意大利的选举表现了人民日益增长的（对加斯贝利政府的）不满，也表现了共产党的力量。”
