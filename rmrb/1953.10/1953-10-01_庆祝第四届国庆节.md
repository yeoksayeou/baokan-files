    Celebrating the Fourth National Day
    Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
    Today, the people of the whole country are celebrating our great festival—the Fourth National Day—with incomparable excitement and enthusiasm.
    Today, as we celebrate National Day, we celebrate the smooth execution of the three major political tasks of 1953, and first of all, we celebrate the great victory of the Chinese people in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a great victory for the people of China and Korea against the U.S. war of aggression, a great victory for the peaceful policy consistently pursued by the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and a great victory for the great unity of peace-loving people all over the world and the just proposition of seeking peaceful solutions to international disputes through negotiation. In such a warm and glorious atmosphere of victory, the people of the whole country celebrate our great National Day, deeply realizing that under the correct leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, they will increase their infinite confidence and unleash their boundless strength to fight for the glorious cause of safeguarding world peace and the universal security of mankind.
    Today, as we celebrate National Day, we celebrate the smooth realization of the basic tasks of our nation's first Five-Year Plan. Under the correct leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, the stage of economic recovery in our country has come to a victorious end, and since 1953, we have entered a period of planned economic construction. From now on, our country will embark on the bright road of transforming from an agricultural country into an industrial country, that is, the long-term future of gradually transitioning from New Democracy to Socialism. The people of the whole country will inevitably feel great excitement and encouragement from the "Slogans for celebrating the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China" released by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Because in these slogans for celebrating National Day, the correct policy of socialist industrialization is clearly put forward, and the clear direction of socialist transformation is also pointed out. With the correct policy and a clear direction, we can advance with the banner of victory in the great economic construction process, overcome any difficulties, take fewer detours, and fully and ahead of schedule realize the great task of our first Five-Year Plan.
    Only by realizing the socialist industrialization of the country, and only by gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, can our country have a bright future and gradually transition from a new democratic society to a socialist society. At the same time, we also recognize that we must concentrate our main forces on developing heavy industry in order to establish the foundation for national industrialization and the modernization of national defense. Neglecting this point will lead us to lose the correct direction and will affect the future of our country's industrialization and the modernization of national defense.
    While concentrating our main forces on developing heavy industry, we must also correspondingly cultivate construction talents, develop transportation, light industry, agriculture, and commerce; promote the cooperation of agriculture and handicrafts in a planned manner; and continue to transform private industry and commerce; and correctly play the role of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. Such policies and guidelines that meet the actual needs of the country and advance steadily and pragmatically will inevitably be supported by the people of the whole country, and they will unanimously strive to implement them to achieve complete results.
    We are very excited to see that our country has made remarkable achievements in implementing the national construction plan in the first half of this year. The five central industrial departments have all completed their half-year construction plans, and the plans for ten major products have been overfulfilled. The situation in the transportation industry is good, and railway and river transport have also been overfulfilled according to plan. Basic construction and other aspects have also achieved considerable achievements. This shows that the achievements made in the smooth implementation of our first Five-Year Plan in the first year have laid a good and solid foundation for the next four years.
    What makes us even more excited is that our great ally, the Soviet Union, has agreed to provide systematic economic and technical assistance in the construction and reconstruction of ninety-one new enterprises in China, as well as the fifty enterprises that are currently under construction and reconstruction. With the rich experience of the Soviet Union's more than 30 years of great socialist construction, and with such sincerity and selflessness in helping us carry out planned national construction, this makes us even more confident in completing and overfulfilling our first Five-Year Plan, gradually establishing our own powerful heavy industry, gradually strengthening our national defense forces, and gradually improving the material and cultural living standards of the people. Chairman Mao specially pointed out in his thank-you telegram to Chairman Malenkov that the Soviet government and the Soviet people's great, comprehensive, long-term, and selfless assistance is an unprecedented undertaking in history. This historic document of Chairman Mao fully expresses the will of the entire Chinese people, thereby making us more deeply aware and sincerely grateful for the great friendship of the Soviet government and the Soviet people. It further encourages us, full of confidence, to learn from the Soviet people, in order to achieve the great and glorious ideal and goal that "the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow."
    The people of the whole country, rejoicing and celebrating this great festival, must respond to the country's solemn call: we must work together, increase production, increase income, practice strict economy, reduce expenditures, and create all favorable conditions for completing and overfulfilling our national construction plan. At the same time, we must enthusiastically and faithfully respond to Chairman Mao's call, study the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, learn from the Soviet Union's experience in socialist construction, and learn from the Soviet Union's advanced science and technology to build our country.
    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the members of our various democratic parties and people's organizations must work harder, strengthen their studies, strengthen their ideological transformation, abide by national discipline, ensure that they do a good job in their posts, and strive to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front.
    As mentioned above, the basic reason why we are all more excited and encouraged this year as we celebrate National Day lies in the great victory of the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and in the smooth start of planned economic construction. At the same time, it also lies in the fact that the general elections are being carried out in all parts of the country, universally raising the people's political awareness and promoting the people's democratic life. Because of these reasons, we are all more deeply aware and believe that, under the correct leadership of the great Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, with the strong assistance of the great ally the Soviet Union, and with the united efforts and unremitting struggle of the broad masses of the people of the whole country, our great motherland will surely be built into a powerful country with national industrialization and modernized national defense, and together with the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, we will strive for the glorious cause of safeguarding world peace, opposing wars of aggression, and creating a beautiful and happy future for mankind.

    庆祝第四届国庆节
    中国国民党革命委员会主席  李济深
    今天全国人民以无比兴奋和热烈的心情来庆祝我们的伟大节日——第四届国庆节。
    我们今天庆祝国庆，要为我们顺利执行一九五三年的三大政治任务而庆祝，首先要为中国人民在抗美援朝斗争中获得了伟大的胜利而庆祝。朝鲜停战协定的签订，是朝中两国人民反对美国侵略战争的伟大胜利，是以苏联为首的和平民主阵营所一贯坚持的和平政策的伟大胜利，是全世界爱好和平人民的大团结，要求和平协商解决国际争端的正义主张的伟大胜利。全国人民在这样热烈的光荣的胜利气氛中，来庆祝我们的伟大国庆节日，都深深地认识到在伟大的毛泽东主席和中国共产党正确领导下，更将增加无限的信心，发挥无穷的力量，为保卫世界持久和平和人类普遍安全的光荣事业而奋斗。
    我们今天庆祝国庆，要为顺利实现我们国家建设第一个五年计划的基本任务而庆祝。在伟大的毛泽东主席和中国共产党正确领导下，我们国家经济恢复阶段业已胜利结束，自一九五三年开始即进入有计划的经济建设时期。从此我们国家就走上了由农业国变为工业国的光明大道。也就是由新民主主义逐步过渡到社会主义的远大前程。全国人民从这次中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会所发布的“庆祝中华人民共和国成立四周年的口号”中，必然会感到莫大的兴奋和鼓舞。因为在这次庆祝国庆的口号中，是明确地提出了关于社会主义工业化的正确方针，也指出了社会主义改造的明确方向。有了正确的方针和明确的方向，我们就能在伟大的经济建设过程中，打着胜利旗帜前进，克服任何困难，少走许多弯路，完满地提前地来实现我们第一个五年计划的伟大任务。
    我们的国家只有实现国家的社会主义工业化，只有逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对私营工商业的社会主义改造，才能有光辉灿烂的前途，才能由新民主主义社会逐步过渡到社会主义社会。同时我们也认识到必须集中主要力量来发展重工业，以建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础。忽视了这一点，就会迷失正确的方向，就会影响到我们国家工业化和国防现代化的前途。
    在集中主要力量发展重工业的同时，我们也要相应地培养建设人材，发展交通运输业、轻工业、农业和商业；有步骤地促进农业、手工业的合作化；同时继续进行对私营工商业的改造；正确地发挥个体农业、手工业和私营工商业的作用。像这样符合国家实际的要求而脚踏实地稳步前进的方针和政策，必然会得到全国人民的拥护和支持，必然会一致努力贯彻执行达成完满的结果。
    我们很兴奋地看出：我们的国家今年上半年执行国家建设计划，已有了显著的成绩，中央五个工业部门都完成了半年建设计划，且有十种主要产品计划已超额完成，运输业方面情况良好，铁路河运也按照计划超额地完成。基本建设和其他方面也都有相当成就。这说明我们第一个五年计划在第一年度顺利执行所表现的成绩，是为今后四年打下了良好的坚固的基础。
    更使我们感到兴奋的是我们的伟大盟邦苏联，同意在建设和改建中国的九十一个新的企业以及正在建设和改建的五十个企业中给以系统的经济的和技术的援助。以苏联三十多年的伟大社会主义建设的丰富经验，而这样诚心诚意大公无私地来帮助我们进行有计划的国家建设。这就使我们更加充满信心来完成和超额完成我们的第一个五年计划，来逐步地建立起自己的强大的重工业，逐步地增强国防力量和逐步地提高人民物质和文化生活的水平。毛主席在致马林科夫主席谢电中特别指出：苏联政府和苏联人民这种伟大的、全面的、长期的、无私的援助，是历史上的创举。毛主席这一历史性的文献，是充分地表达全中国人民的意志，从而使我们更加深刻地认识和衷心地感谢苏联政府和苏联人民的伟大友谊。更加鼓起勇气，充满信心来向苏联人民学习，以期达到“苏联的今天就是我们的明天”这一伟大光荣的理想和目的。
    全国人民欢欣鼓舞庆祝伟大节日，一定要响应国家的庄严号召：我们要一致努力，增加生产，增加收入，厉行节约，紧缩开支，为完成和超额完成我们国家建设计划创造一切有利的条件。同时我们更要热烈地、忠诚地响应毛主席的号召，学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，学习苏联社会主义建设的经验，学习苏联先进的科学技术，来建设我们的国家。
    我们各民主党派、各人民团体的成员们，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，更要努力，加强学习，加强思想改造，遵守国家纪律，保证搞好岗位工作，并为巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线而努力。
    我们今年庆祝国庆，已如上面所说，使我们大家更加兴奋更加鼓舞的基本原因，在于获得了抗美援朝斗争的伟大胜利，在于顺利开始了有计划的经济建设。同时也在于全国各地进行普选工作，普遍地提高了人民政治觉悟并增进了人民民主生活。由于这些原因，就更使我们深深地认识到，并相信着，在伟大的毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导下，在伟大的盟邦苏联大力援助下，并在全国广大的人民一致努力奋斗不懈的情况下，我们伟大的祖国一定会建成为一个国家工业化，国防现代化的强大国家，和以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，共为保卫世界持久和平，反对侵略战争，并创造人类美满幸福前途的光荣事业而奋斗。
