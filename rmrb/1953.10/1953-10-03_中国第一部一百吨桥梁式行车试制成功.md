China's first 100-ton bridge crane has been successfully manufactured before National Day. The trial run on September 29th yielded good results. This massive crane for the transportation front was manufactured by the workers of the state-owned Shanghai Boiler Factory. It will soon appear in the new workshop of the Chongqing 101 Steel Plant.

The girder frame of this 100-ton bridge crane is 57 feet long, over 10 feet high, and more than 30 feet wide. Its total weight is about 140 tons. A single hook is as tall as two people, and above the hook are 20 steel wire ropes, each woven from six strands of thirty-seven steel wires. It requires 150 kilowatts of electricity to operate. Its lifting capacity is equivalent to lifting 2,200 dan (approximately 110 metric tons) of grain or the amount of coal loaded onto 25 trucks at once. This is an indispensable and important piece of equipment for large steel plants, machine manufacturing factories, and other factories and mines.

The Shanghai Boiler Factory only started manufacturing 30-ton cranes at the end of last year, but this year it is already capable of manufacturing 100-ton cranes. This is a significant contribution made by the factory's workers to the first year of the Five-Year Plan by overcoming difficulties. The entire design work was undertaken by more than ten technicians led by the factory's chief engineer Li Bide and engineer Yang Lizhou. Most of these technicians were recent graduates, and some were participating in crane design for the first time. With the help of the workers, especially the veteran worker Yuan Mao囡 of the crane workshop, they not only completed the general design tasks but also made many creative achievements. The workers involved in the manufacturing process devised various methods to overcome the difficulties of insufficient equipment and incomplete materials. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中国第一部一百吨桥梁式行车试制成功
    新中国第一部一百吨桥梁式行车已在国庆节前夕制造成功了。九月二十九日试车结果良好。这部搬运战线上的巨大行车，是由国营上海锅炉厂职工们制造的。它不久就要在重庆一零一钢铁厂的新车间里出现。
    这部一百吨桥梁式行车的梁架有五丈七尺长、一丈多高、三丈多宽，全身重约一百四十吨，一只吊钩有两个人高，吊钩上面有二十根钢丝绳，每根钢丝绳都是用六股三十七根钢丝编起来的，开动起来要用一百五十瓩的电力。它的吊重量等于一下子吊起二千二百担粮食或二十五辆卡车所装载的煤。这是大型的钢铁厂、机器制造厂等厂矿生产上不可缺少的重要设备。
    上海锅炉厂去年年底才开始制造三十吨的行车，而今年却能制造一百吨的行车了。这是该厂职工们战胜困难对五年计划第一年所作的重大贡献。全部设计工作是由该厂总工程师李彼德、工程师杨立洲等为首的十多个技术员担任的。这些技术员中的大多数是刚从学校毕业出来的学生，有的还是第一次参加行车的设计。他们在得到工人们的帮助特别是行车车间的老工人袁毛囡的帮助后，不仅完成了一般的设计任务，而且作出了不少富有创造性的成绩。参加制造工作的工人们曾想出各种办法克服了设备不够、材料不全的困难。　（新华社）
