Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 17th. According to a report in the London "Daily Worker" on the 15th, the last group of 150 British prisoners of war returning from Korea arrived in Southampton on the troopship "Empire Orwell" on the 14th. Among these British prisoners of war was Lieutenant Colonel J.P. Carne, commander of the 1st Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment.

The "Daily Worker" said, "The former prisoners of war who returned this time, like their comrades who returned on the troopship Asturias last month, are tanned and in good spirits. They generally say that the treatment they received was 'quite good'."

Some of the prisoners of war described their experiences and lives during their captivity to the "Daily Worker" reporter. Rafferty, a soldier from Glasgow, said: "The treatment was very good. The food was mainly rice and bread. We were very free, and I played football once a week." Wagner, a soldier originally from Delbert who was captured during the Battle of Imjin River, said: The living conditions got better and better, and the treatment was very good. "They adopted a lenient policy." Sub-Lieutenant Martell, a Royal Navy pilot who had been a prisoner of war for eight months, was shot down by ground anti-aircraft fire. He said that he had never been subjected to physical abuse.

    自朝鲜归国的英国战俘
    承认受到我方良好待遇
    【新华社柏林十七日电】据伦敦“工人日报”十五日消息，最后一批自朝鲜归国的英国战俘一百五十人，乘运兵船“帝国奥威尔”号，于十四日返抵南安普敦。这批英国战俘中间有格罗斯特团第一营营长杰·普·卡恩中校。
    “工人日报”说，“这一次回来的前战俘和上月乘阿斯都里亚斯号运兵船回来的他们的伙伴们一样，都是黑黝黝的，气色很好。他们一般都说，他们所受到的待遇‘相当好’。”
    一部分战俘向“工人日报”记者叙述了他们的经历和被俘期间的生活。格拉斯哥的士兵拉裴蒂说：“待遇很不错。饭食主要是大米饭和面包。我们自由得很，我每个星期踢一次足球。”在临津江战役时被俘的原籍德尔柏的士兵瓦格说：生活情况愈过愈好，待遇很好，“他们采取宽大政策”。皇家海军飞行员马特尔少尉已当了八个月战俘，他是被地面高射炮火打落的。他说，他从来不曾受到过肉体上的虐待。
