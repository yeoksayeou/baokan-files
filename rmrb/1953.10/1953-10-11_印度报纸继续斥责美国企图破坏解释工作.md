Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 10th: Indian newspapers continue to criticize the American conspiracy to sabotage the explanation work in Korea.

    The "Amrita Bazar Patrika," under the title "Dirty Conspiracy," commented on the situation in Korea, saying: "The attitude of the United Nations Command gives rise to new worries. The political and moral responsibility of the UN forces—as well as the Korean-Chinese side—is to create conditions that would allow the Indian Custodial Force to perform its mission 'seriously and gloriously.' However, current events have made it almost clear that the UN Command is not taking its responsibility very seriously." The newspaper criticized the US refusal to extend the explanation period, saying: "Due to unexpected reasons for which the UN Command should at least bear indirect responsibility, the 'explanation' work could not begin on the scheduled date. Therefore, it was only natural to hope that the original deadline would be extended. The important point is that the 'explanation' work should be a period of ninety days. General Clark's refusal to acknowledge this is yet another example of the UN Command's unwillingness to allow the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and its affiliated Indian Custodial Force to perform their mission 'seriously and gloriously.'" The newspaper mentioned Dulles' expression of "unpleasantness" towards the activities of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, saying: "If any activity has caused unpleasantness in the world, it is the United States' own activities. Swedish Foreign Minister Undén's sharp response to the accusations against the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission clearly reflects this unpleasant feeling throughout the world."

    The "Times of India" criticized Dulles' remarks on the 8th, saying: "Since the South Korean government openly threatened to take action against the Indian Custodial Force, neither the US government in Washington nor the UN Command in Tokyo has issued any protests or rebukes. On the contrary, Dulles deliberately refrained from commenting on South Korea's threats against India during a press conference and used the words 'so-called' to describe the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which is solemnly supported by the United Nations, including the United States... Throughout these unfortunate events, the attitude of the UN Command and the US government has gradually shifted from acquiescence to incitement. Failure to protest against South Korea's threats and warnings to the Indian Custodial Force is like endorsing their planned actions, which is very dangerous."

### 印度报纸继续斥责美国企图破坏解释工作

    印度报纸继续斥责美国企图破坏解释工作
    【新华社十日讯】    新德里消息：印度报纸继续抨击美国在朝鲜破坏解释工作的阴谋。
    “甘露市场报”以“肮脏的阴谋”为题评论朝鲜的形势说：“联合国军司令部的态度使人发生新的忧虑。联军方面——朝中方面也是一样——的政治和道义上的责任，是要创造条件使得印度看管军能够‘严肃而光荣’地执行任务。然而目前的事件已经使人几乎明显地看出，联军司令部并不是在十分认真地尽它的责任。”该报抨击美方拒绝延长解释期限说：“由于至少应该由联军司令部负间接责任的意外的原因，使得‘解释’工作不能在规定的日期开始。因此，希望把原来规定的截止日期加以延长原是理所当然的事。重要的问题是：‘解释’工作应该是九十天的时期。克拉克将军拒绝承认这一点，这是联军司令部不愿意让中立国遣返委员会及其附属的印度看管军‘严肃而光荣’地执行其任务的又一例证。”该报讲到杜勒斯对于中立国遣返委员会的活动表示“不愉快”时说：“假若有什么活动已经在世界上引起人们不愉快的话，那是美国自己的活动。瑞典外交大臣恩顿对于那些反对中立国遣返委员会的指责所提出的尖锐的答复，明显地反映了全世界的这种不愉快的情绪。”
    “印度时报”八日抨击杜勒斯的谈话说：“自从南朝鲜政府公开威胁说要对印度看管军队采取行动以来，华盛顿的美国政府和东京的联合国军司令部都没有提出任何抗议或斥责。反之，杜勒斯在记者招待会上倒故意不对南朝鲜向印度进行的威胁发表意见，而用‘所谓’这样的字眼来形容包括美国在内的联合国所郑重支持的中立国遣返委员会。……在这些不幸事件发生的整个过程中，联合国军司令部和美国政府的态度已从默认渐渐转变到煽动。对于南朝鲜向印度看管军队进行的威胁和警告不提出任何抗议，就很像是赞成他们所计划的行动，这是很危险的。”
