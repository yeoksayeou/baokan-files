    Local Tax Authorities Strengthen Tax Collection Work During Peak Season

    [This newspaper dispatch] To ensure the completion of tax revenue tasks during the peak season, local tax authorities, under the guidance of local Party and government leading organs, have been actively preparing for tax collection in the past two months. The collection of industrial and commercial taxes this year is as follows: from January to September, the national tax revenue plan was 65.18% completed, of which income tax only completed 32.63% of the plan. From the perspective of the overall task, the fourth quarter still needs to complete 34.82% of the national tax revenue plan, especially income tax, which still needs to complete 67.37% (estimated from January to September this year). Therefore, the tax revenue task in the fourth quarter is quite heavy.

    Currently, in addition to focusing on regular tax collection during the peak season, local tax authorities have also specially organized forces to negotiate and estimate income tax based on the business and profit situation of private industrial and commercial enterprises they have mastered. The estimated negotiation work for income tax of private enterprises in Shanghai from January to September began in late September. Because private enterprises' business has increased and profits have risen, and tax authorities have basically grasped the profit situation of various industries, and taxpayers' awareness of fulfilling their legal tax obligations has improved, the process is generally smooth. So far, most industries have reached agreements, and only a few industries are continuing to negotiate estimates. Tianjin is now conducting a review of key households, providing guidance and inspection to account-checking households, and also starting to evaluate and negotiate based on investigation materials for democratic appraisal households. It is estimated that most of the income tax payments from industrial and commercial households in Beijing can be deposited into the treasury before the end of October. Guangzhou is conducting a key review. Income tax deposit work in Wuhan can basically be completed by the end of the month. In other provinces and cities, most are conducting reviews and evaluations simultaneously, organizing tax payments into the treasury.

    A small number of industrial and commercial households in some cities and industries lack sufficient understanding of legal tax payment and "realistic estimation," conceal their true business conditions, and underreport or falsely report profits in an attempt to pay less tax. Therefore, the estimation work has not yet reached an agreement. For example, the business volume of new drug businesses in Shanghai from January to September this year is equal to the entire year's business volume last year, but the industry's negotiation representative said, "The situation in our industry is getting worse year by year." Another example is that the Shanghai Grand and Middle Western Medicine Stores reported an estimated tax rate of 7.25% to the public association, but after a preliminary investigation by the tax bureau, the estimated tax rate of this store should be around 13%. Now, local tax authorities are further helping these industrial and commercial households correct this incorrect attitude, and at the same time, are taking effective measures to deeply explore tax sources to ensure the smooth completion of income tax estimation work.

    The phenomenon of tax evasion and tax arrears by industrial and commercial households in various places is still very serious. Many illegal capitalists who were exposed during the "Five-Anti" campaign have now relapsed. Tax evasion is not only serious in industrial and commercial taxes but also equally serious in other taxes, especially commodity circulation taxes and goods taxes. For example, in August, Tianjin conducted an investigation into manufacturers producing steel, hardware, and non-ferrous metals, and found that in commodity circulation tax, steel alone had sixteen types of goods with tax omissions. Calculating based on the two products of railroad splints and drilling equipment, the average monthly tax omission is 260 million yuan. In August, a branch of the Jinan Tax Bureau inspected fourteen typical households and found that all fourteen households had tax evasion behaviors, with the average tax evasion of chemical glue factory households reaching 44%. In some areas, there are even industrial and commercial households that do not pay taxes at all. For example, in May, Taiyuan conducted a registration of commodity circulation tax and goods tax taxable products and found as many as 83 households that should have paid taxes but did not, accounting for 17.5% of the city's original number of taxable factories. Tianjin also found 37 households that had completely evaded taxes in the past after inspection.

    Regarding tax arrears, as of the end of August, the Central Taxation Administration's statistics showed that private industrial and commercial enterprises nationwide owed more than 448 billion yuan in taxes. The phenomenon of tax arrears is particularly serious among industrial and commercial households in large and medium-sized cities. For example, in the East China region, tax arrears of industrial and commercial households in large and medium-sized cities account for more than 90% of the total. In the Central South region, tax arrears of industrial and commercial households in large and medium-sized cities account for 75% of the total. In the North China region, tax arrears of industrial and commercial households in large and medium-sized cities account for 96% of the total. In the Northeast region, tax arrears of industrial and commercial households in large and medium-sized cities account for 92% of the total.

    This serious situation of tax evasion and tax arrears has aroused serious attention from Party and government leading organs and tax authorities in various places. Various places are now taking effective measures according to the situation, mobilizing industrial and commercial households to self-check and supplement their reports, and conducting anti-tax evasion struggles with the active assistance of workers and shop assistants. At the same time, in conjunction with this struggle, tax arrears are being seriously cleared up. Some cities have sent the most stubborn tax-resisting and tax-owing households to the People's Courts for punishment according to law.

    In order to resolutely implement tax policies, act according to law, prevent deviations, do a good job in this year's peak season collection work, and ensure the completion of the national tax revenue plan, Party and government leading organs in various places are strengthening their leadership over tax work, issuing instructions, explaining policies, conducting in-depth inspections, and urging tax authorities to do a good job in peak season collection work. They are also drawing a large number of cadres to form working groups and go to various cities and counties to specifically help and promote peak season collection work. The Central Ministry of Finance has instructed the State Taxation Administration to send working groups to various places to assist in peak season collection work. The financial management bureaus and tax management bureaus of major administrative regions have also transferred a large number of cadres to assist in collection work in various places.

### 各地税务机关加强旺季税收工作

    各地税务机关加强旺季税收工作
    【本报讯】为了保证完成旺季税收任务，近两个月来，各地税务机关在当地党政领导机关的指导下，积极进行了收税的准备工作。本年度工商各税征收的情况是：全国一至九月份完成全年税收计划百分之六十五点一八，其中所得税仅完成计划百分之三十二点六三。从总的任务来看，第四季度还须完成全国税收计划百分之三十四点八二，尤其是所得税还有百分之六十七点三七（估征今年一至九月份的）需要完成。因此，第四季度税收任务相当繁重。
    目前，各地税务机关除抓紧旺季经常税收工作外，已专门组织力量，根据所掌握的私营工商业营业情况、利润情况，协商估征所得税。上海市私营企业一至九月份所得税估征协商工作，从九月下旬开始后，由于私营企业营业上升、利润增加，税务机关基本掌握了各行业利润情况，以及纳税户对履行守法纳税义务的认识有所提高，一般进行顺利。到目前为止，大多数行业已达成协议，只有少数行业继续在协商估征中。天津市现在正进行重点户复查工作，对查帐户进行辅导检查，对民主评定户根据调查材料，也开始进行评议协商。北京市工商业户的所得税款，估计十月底以前可以大部入库。广州市正在进行重点复查。武汉市所得税入库工作，月底可以基本结束。其他省市，大部分正在一面进行复查，一面进行评议，组织税款入库。
    有些城市的少数行业的工商户，对守法纳税与“从实估征”认识不足，隐匿真实营业情况，少报或假报利润，企图少纳税，因此估征工作还没有取得协议。如上海市新药商业今年一至九月份的营业额等于去年全年的营业额，但该业的协商代表却说：“我业情况一年比一年差。”又如该市大中西药行向公会所报的估征率为百分之七点二五，但经税务局初步调查，该号的估征率应在百分之十三上下。现在，各地税务机关还在进一步帮助这些工商户纠正这种不正确的态度，同时在采取有效办法深入发掘税源，保证所得税估征工作的顺利完成。
    各地工商户偷税漏税和拖欠税款的现象仍很严重，许多在“五反”期间被揭发的不法资本家，现在又故态复萌了。偷税漏税现象，不仅工商业税方面严重，在其他税，特别是商品流通税、货物税方面也同样严重。如天津市八月份对产制钢材、五金及有色金属的厂商进行调查，发现在商品流通税中，仅钢材一项，有十六种商品漏税，以其中的铁道夹板和钻探器材两种产品计算，每月平均即漏税二亿六千万元。济南市税务局的一个分局，在八月份检查了十四个典型户，竟发现这十四户都有偷税漏税的行为，其中化学胶业厂户平均偷税漏税达百分之四十四。有些地区甚至还存在着完全不纳税的工商户。例如太原市在五月份进行了一次商品流通税、货物税应税产品登记，就检查出应纳而未纳税的漏户八十三户之多，占该市原有纳税工厂户数的百分之十七点五。天津市经过检查也发现过去全部漏税的有三十七户。
    在拖欠税款方面，中央税务总局截至八月底的统计，全国私营工商业拖欠税款达四千四百八十余亿元。拖欠税款现象尤以大中城市的工商户为严重。如华东全区工商户的欠税，大中城市工商户所欠的即占百分之九十以上，中南区大中城市工商户欠税占总额百分之七十五，华北区大中城市工商户欠税占总额百分之九十六，东北区大中城市工商户欠税占总额百分之九十二。
    这种偷税漏税和拖欠税款的严重情况，已引起各地党政领导机关和税务机关的严重注意。各地现在正分别情况，采取有效措施，动员工商户自查补报，并在工人店员积极协助之下，进行反偷漏斗争，同时结合这一斗争，认真清理欠税。有些城市已将十分刁顽的抗税欠税户送交人民法院依法惩处。
    为了坚决贯彻税收政策，依法办事，防止偏差，做好今年旺季征收工作，保证国家税收计划的完成，各地党、政领导机关正加强对税收工作的领导，发出指示，交代政策，深入检查，督促税务机关作好旺季征收工作，并抽派大批干部组成工作组，分别到各市县具体帮助与推动旺季征收工作。中央财政部已责成税务总局派出工作组，到各地协助旺季征收工作。各大行政区财政管理局和税务管理局也抽调了大批干部，分赴各地协助征收工作。
