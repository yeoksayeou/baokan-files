    Central Railway Ministry Materials Supply Bureau
    Determined to Improve Telegraph Pole Supply Work
    A letter from the Central Railway Ministry Materials Supply Bureau: Comrade Guo Rukun's criticisms and suggestions regarding our bureau's telegraph pole supply work, published in the "Summary of Letters from Readers" column on August 15th, are correct. We have now decided:
    (1) To consult with the Engineering Bureau and the Management Bureau to determine the working capital of the anti-corrosion plant; and to suggest that the anti-corrosion plant peel the bark of the telegraph poles in a timely manner after they enter the plant to facilitate drying and oiling.
    (2) To instruct the Harbin Timber Factory to study and improve oiling techniques with the anti-corrosion plant, and to conduct strict inspections to improve the quality of oiled telegraph poles.
    (3) The suggestion to use fir wood for telegraph poles is reasonable. However, the output of fir wood is not large, and it would be difficult to switch to fir wood for all railways nationwide at present (it is understood that not all telegraph poles used by the postal and telecommunications departments are made of fir wood either). Fir wood is mostly produced in the south, so we have decided that each bureau in the south should use fir wood for telegraph poles, and each bureau in the north should use Korean pine and white pine for telegraph poles in accordance with the state's regulations on tree species, which is still reasonable. However, we have done a very poor job in further technically studying and improving the supply of telegraph poles. In the future, in addition to striving to improve, we will also suggest that the forestry department increase the output of fir wood.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央铁道部材料供应局
    决心改进电杆供应工作
    中央铁道部材料供应局来信：八月十五日“读者来信摘要”栏所刊郭儒坤同志对我局电杆供应工作的批评和建议是正确的。现在我们决定：
    （一）商请工务局及管理局核定防腐厂的流动资金；建议防腐厂在电杆进厂后及时剥皮以便干燥注油。
    （二）责成哈尔滨木材厂与防腐厂研究改进注油技术，并严格检查，以提高注油电杆的质量。
    （三）改用杉木作电杆的意见是合理的。但杉木产量不大，如目前全国铁路都改用杉木作电杆是有困难的（经了解，邮电部门的电杆也未全部使用杉木）。杉木多产在南方，故我们决定南方各局采用杉木作电杆，北方各局根据国家规定树种采用黄花松与白松作电杆，还是合理的。但是我们对进一步在技术上研究改善电杆的供应工作方面作得很差。今后除努力改进外，并建议林业部门提高杉木产量。
