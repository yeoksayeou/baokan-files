Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 23rd. Our special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: Many signs indicate that the U.S. side is attempting to use the destruction of the explanation work as a step towards their complete destruction of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

From the moment the prisoners of war were handed over to the Indian forces, the U.S. side has been trying every possible means to undermine the agreement on prisoners of war in the Korean Armistice Agreement. First, the U.S. side unreasonably demanded restrictions on the observation of the transfer of prisoners of war by the Korean and Chinese observer representatives; then, they fabricated various excuses to delay the start of the explanation work and refused to extend the explanation period; now, they are using the special agents they have planted among the prisoners of war to prevent the prisoners of war from listening to the explanation by means of terrorist tactics, which has caused the explanation work to be suspended for five days.

This series of destructive actions by the U.S. side has put the Korean armistice in a serious situation. The U.S. military authorities, who created this situation, are rejoicing. According to a report from Washington by the Associated Press, a senior official of the U.S. Department of Defense was "apparently very pleased with the situation regarding the repatriation issue." This official also said triumphantly, "There is no need to worry now" because "we have India on our side." This senior U.S. official apparently believes that the Indian custodian forces have not taken effective measures against the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents mixed in among the prisoners of war, and that it is helpful for the special agents to use terrorist tactics to prevent the prisoners of war from listening to the explanation.

It is not difficult for people to see that the U.S. side's destruction of the explanation work has put the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" in the Armistice Agreement in serious danger of becoming a dead letter, that is, in serious danger of completely destroying the Armistice Agreement. If the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and world public opinion succumb to U.S. pressure and allow the U.S. to arbitrarily undermine the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement concerning the repatriation of prisoners of war, then the U.S. will further attempt to undermine the Korean political conference, until it finally tears up the entire Korean Armistice Agreement and destroys the Korean armistice.

This U.S. conspiracy has been revealed in many ways. According to the U.S. side's suggestion, the preliminary meeting of the Korean political conference will be held on October 26, but the Syngman Rhee gang is already clamoring that if the political conference cannot be convened on October 28, he will not be bound by the Armistice Agreement. News from the U.S. side proves that Syngman Rhee's clamor is instructed by the U.S. warmongers. The mouthpiece of the U.S. warmongers, the vice president of the Associated Press, Hoberecht, was already saying on the 20th that "the political conference may never be convened. There was no definite agreement in the past to convene such a conference." He also incited public opinion, saying: "The seriousness of the Korean armistice and the prisoner of war situation will soon reach its peak... the chances of achieving lasting peace are getting smaller and smaller." Hoberecht also said that the U.S. military headquarters has made preparations for the resumption of war. The American "Newsweek" asked the American people "not to be stunned" "if new war breaks out in Korea," and said that the American "responsible intelligence personnel urgently demanded to be prepared."

All this shows that in the face of the U.S. offensive against the Korean Armistice Agreement, we must not take a step back. If we do not fight to maintain the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," if we show fear of this crazy destructive behavior by the U.S. side, it may become an encouragement to the U.S. side to destroy the Korean armistice. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the peace-loving people of the world, especially the people of the neutral countries, are now facing a serious task, they must resolutely fight to ensure the strict implementation of the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "detailed rules for explanation and visit work." This is not only a question concerning the freedom and happiness of the prisoners of war who want to go home, but also a question concerning peace in Korea and peace in the Far East.

### 美方继续有计划地阻挠和破坏解释工作  使停战协定面临被完全破坏的严重危险

    美方继续有计划地阻挠和破坏解释工作
    使停战协定面临被完全破坏的严重危险
    【新华社开城二十三日电】本社特派记者江南报道：许多迹象表明：美方企图用破坏解释工作来作为他们完全破坏朝鲜停战协定的一个步骤。
    从战俘被移交给印度部队看管的时候起，美方就想尽一切办法破坏朝鲜停战协定中关于战俘问题的协议。首先美方无理地要求限制朝中观察代表观察战俘移交工作；接着又制造种种藉口拖延解释工作的开始，并且拒绝顺延解释期限；现在又利用他们安插在战俘中间的特务分子用恐怖手段阻止战俘听取解释，使解释工作因此已经停顿了五天之久。
    美方这一系列破坏行为已经使朝鲜停战面临严重的局势。一手造成这种局势的美国军事当局正兴高采烈。合众社从华盛顿报道说，美国国防部的一位高级官员“对遣返问题的局势显然很得意”。这位官员还得意忘形地说，“现在已用不着担忧”了，因为“我们已有印度在我们这一边”。这位美国高级官员显然认为，印度看管部队没有对混在战俘中间的李承晚和蒋介石特务分子采取有效措施，对于特务分子用恐怖手段阻止战俘听取解释的活动是有帮助的。
    人们不难看到，美方对解释工作的破坏已使停战协定中“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”有变成一纸空文的严重危险，也就是有使停战协定被完全破坏的严重危险。如果中立国遣返委员会和世界舆论屈从于美国的压力，允许美国任意破坏朝鲜停战协定中有关战俘遣返问题的条款，那末美国就将进一步企图破坏朝鲜政治会议，直到最后撕毁整个朝鲜停战协定，破坏朝鲜停战。
    美国的这个阴谋已经在许多方面透露了出来。根据美方的建议，朝鲜政治会议的预备会议将在十月二十六日举行，但是李承晚匪帮已经在叫嚣说，如果政治会议不能在十月二十八日召开，他就要不受停战协定的约束。美国方面传出来的消息证明：李承晚这种叫嚣是美国的好战分子们所授意的。美国好战分子的喉舌合众社副社长霍布雷奇特在二十日已在说什么“政治会议可能永远不会召开。过去并没有肯定的协议要召开这种会议”。他还大肆煽动说：“朝鲜的停战和战俘局势的严重性很快达到顶点……达成持久和平的机会越来越少了。”霍布雷奇特并且说，美军司令部已作战争恢复的准备。美国的“新闻周刊”要美国人民在“如果朝鲜有新的战事爆发”的时候“不要目瞪口呆”，并且说，美国的“负责情报方面的人士迫切地要求作好准备”。
    这一切说明：在美国对朝鲜停战协定所发动的进攻面前，决不能后退一步。如果不为维护“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”而斗争，如果对美方这种疯狂的破坏行为表示畏缩，就可能成为对美方破坏朝鲜停战的鼓励。中立国遣返委员会和全世界爱好和平的人民，特别是各中立国家的人民，现在已经面临了一个严重的任务，他们必须为保证“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”的严格实施而坚决斗争。这不但是一个有关要求回家的战俘的自由与幸福的问题，而且是有关朝鲜和平和远东和平的问题。
