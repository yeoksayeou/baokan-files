(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 21st) Special correspondent Wu Min reports: The commander of the Indian Custodial Forces admitted today that the secret agents in the prisoner-of-war camps are receiving "help from outside the prisoner-of-war camps." However, he said, "We can't do anything about it, we can't stop this from happening."

The problem is very clear: if the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces do not take effective measures to break the American agents' reign of terror, then control of the prisoner-of-war camps will continue to be entirely in the hands of the Syngman Rhee and Kuomintang gangs. The danger of this situation can be clearly seen from the incident on September 25th, when Indian officers were detained by agents.

Zhu Shuwu, a former Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war repatriated on the first day of explanation work, came from Camp 31 where the incident occurred. He served as the deputy squad leader in this camp and knew the whole story of the incident. He said that on September 24th, Wang Xu, the acting deputy battalion commander and translator of Camp 31, requested repatriation from the Indian Custodial Forces and was taken out of the camp. The next day, the special agent battalion commander of this camp summoned personnel above the rank of deputy squad leader and said to them: "Wang Xu's departure is very unfavorable to us, he will expose all our secrets; the most dangerous thing is that many people will see Wang Xu leave and follow his example. Today we must detain the Indian officers and exchange them for Wang Xu. If the Indians don't agree, we will rush out." That afternoon, the agents forced the prisoners of war to hold a "demonstration" and took two Indian officers hostage. The agents, according to past American instructions, beat the Indian officers with flagpoles, insulted them to their hearts' content, tore off their epaulets and symbols, and even surrounded General Thorat, who later arrived at the scene, before finally releasing the two Indian officers. Zhu Shuwu said: "I know all the details of how the agents released the Indian officers at that time." Zhu Shuwu pointed out that the agents' actions of insulting the Indian Custodial Forces had been planned long ago. Zhu Shuwu said: "Before we left Jeju Island, the agents' regimental commander and battalion commander told us more than once that the Americans instructed us to hate the Indians, to make trouble for the Indians as much as possible, and even to beat them to death. They even arrogantly said that India is a colony and would not dare to do anything to us. If the Indians are not good to us, the United States will expel India from the United Nations."

Zhu Shuwu pointed out that these agents even used the convenience provided by the Indian troops to carry out espionage activities. Zhu Shuwu said that just as he and another twenty-four prisoners of war were waiting in the explanation tent to be explained, Liu Wenjie, the agent's deputy battalion commander who was impersonating a prisoner of war representative, even rode in an Indian troop vehicle, under the guise of "checking whether the flagpoles had been removed," to this separate tent to intimidate the prisoners of war. He said: "Whoever dares to ask to return home will be beaten to death!" Liu Wenjie also said to Zhu Shuwu: "Deputy squad leader, you must keep a close watch on them, or even you will be beaten to death!" Zhu Shuwu was the last in this team to arrive at the explanation site, and as soon as he entered the explanation tent and saw the Korean-Chinese side's explanation representative, he requested repatriation.

Zhu Shuwu said: After Wang Xu was repatriated, because the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission did not take effective measures to deal with these agents, the terrorist activities of the agents in Camp 31 to control the prisoners of war became even more intensified, and the contact between agents in various camps became more frequent. Zhu Shuwu said: "The agents increased the guards from more than a dozen to more than ninety, standing guard day and night. There were more than twenty fixed哨posts set up around the barbed wire alone, and guard posts were filled everywhere in the kitchen, water pipes, toilets, and tent entrances, far more than the Indian guards." The agents openly stood on their self-built four-meter-high liaison platforms during the day and used semaphore to communicate with other camps, shouting through megaphones. The prisoner-of-war camp had completely become the world of the agents. The prisoners of war were unable to hear the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's broadcast and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work," while the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek agents could freely disrupt the explanation work schedule according to the instructions from the US military headquarters and Seoul. The agents did not allow the Indian soldiers to enter the camp to take roll call and even forced the Indian soldiers on guard to withdraw from the inner barbed wire to the outermost layer. The agents beat and interrogated prisoners of war in the prisoner-of-war camp, doing whatever they wanted. Two volunteer army prisoners of war have already been beaten to death.

Returnee Wu Yongfang also said that the shovels that the Indian troops distributed to the prisoners of war for digging ditches were collected by the agents and refused to be returned. Later, the agents used these shovels to dig graves under the bunks of some tents in Camp 33 and said to the prisoners of war: "Whoever dares to ask to return home will be buried alive. If the Indian soldiers dare to interfere, they will be buried too!"

Facts have proved that being kind to the Rhee and Chiang agents is being cruel to the prisoners of war who demand repatriation. To ensure that the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work" can be strictly implemented, it is necessary to immediately purge the Rhee and Chiang agents mixed in among the prisoners of war and break their reign of terror in the prisoner-of-war camps.

### 必须坚决肃清混在战俘营中的美方特务  中立国遣返委员会职权范围才能严格实施

    必须坚决肃清混在战俘营中的美方特务
    中立国遣返委员会职权范围才能严格实施
    【新华社开城二十一日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：印度看管部队司令今天承认，战俘营里面的特务分子正在得到“战俘营以外的帮助”。但是他说，“我们对此毫无办法，我们无法阻止这种情形。”
    问题是很清楚的，如果中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队不采取有效措施来打破美方特务的恐怖统治，那末，战俘营的控制权将继续完全操在李承晚和国民党匪帮手中。这种情况的危险性，可以从九月二十五日印度军官被特务分子扣留的事件中明显地看出来。
    在解释工作的第一天被遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员朱书武，是从发生这一事件的三十一号营场出来的。他在这个营场里担任副小队长，他完全知道这一事件的经过情形。他说，九月二十四日，三十一号营场代理副大队长兼翻译王旭向印度看管部队要求遣返并被带出营场。第二天，这个营场的特务大队长召集副小队长以上人员开会，对他们说：“王旭走了对我们非常不利，他会把我们的机密都暴露了；最危险的是许多人看见王旭走了，也会学他的样子。我们今天要把印度军官扣起来，和他们换回王旭，如果印度人不答应，我们就往外冲。”当天下午，特务们就强迫战俘举行“示威”，并把两名印度军官扣起来作为人质。特务们按照过去美方的指示，用旗杆殴打印度军官，尽情地侮辱他们，撕掉了他们的肩章和符号，甚至还包围了以后赶到出事地点的托拉特将军，最后才将这两名印度军官放走。朱书武说：“当时特务放走印度军官的详细情节，我完全知道。”朱书武指出，特务分子侮辱印度看管部队的行动是早就计划好了的。朱书武说：“我们离开济州岛以前，特务联队长和大队长不止一次地告诉我们，美国人指示要仇视印度人，要多找印度人的麻烦，甚至可以把他们打死。他们甚至狂妄地说，印度是个殖民地，不敢对我们怎么样。如果印度人对我们不好，美国就要把印度从联合国里开除出去。”
    朱书武指出，这些特务分子甚至利用印度部队给他们的方便来进行特务活动。朱书武说，就在他和另外二十四个战俘在等待解释的帐篷里等候接受解释的时候，冒充战俘代表的特务副大队长刘文杰还坐着印度部队的汽车，以“检查旗杆是否都已收走”为名，到这个单独的帐篷里来恐吓战俘。他说：“你们谁敢要求回国，就一定把他打死！”刘文杰还对朱书武说：“小队副，你可要监视好他们，不然就连你也打死！”朱书武在这一队的最后到了解释地点，他一进解释帐篷见了朝中方面的解释代表就要求遣返。
    朱书武说：在王旭被遣返以后，由于中立国遣返委员会没有采取有效措施来对付这些特务，第三十一号营场的特务分子控制战俘的恐怖活动更加变本加厉，各营场间特务分子的联络也更加频繁。朱书武说：“特务们把警备队员从十多个人增加到九十多个人，日夜站岗。单是铁丝网四周就设了二十多个固定哨，伙房、水管、厕所、帐篷门口到处站满了岗哨，比印度人的警卫多得多。”特务们在白天公开地站在自己搭的四公尺高的联络台上和别的营场打旗语，用传声筒喊话。战俘营完全变成特务的天下，战俘们没有能够听到中立国遣返委员会的广播词和“解释和访问工作细则”，而李承晚和蒋介石特务却可以根据美军总部与汉城的指示，自由地破坏解释工作的日程。特务们不让印度兵进营场点名，甚至迫使站岗的印度兵从里层铁丝网撤退到最外层。特务们在战俘营里殴打、审问战俘，为所欲为。有两名志愿军被俘人员已被活活打死。
    归来人员吴永芳也说，印度部队发给战俘挖水沟用的铲子，被特务收藏了起来，拒绝交还。后来，特务分子就用这些铲子在三十三号营场某些帐篷的床铺下挖好了墓坑，并且对战俘说：“谁敢要求回国，就把他活埋。印度兵敢来干涉，就连他们也埋掉！”
    事实证明：对李、蒋特务仁慈，就是对要求遣返的战俘残忍。要使“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”能够严格地付诸实施，就必须立即肃清混在战俘中间的李、蒋特务，打破他们在战俘营中的恐怖统治。
