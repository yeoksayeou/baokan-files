October 19th is the day of the glorious sacrifice of Huang Jiguang, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's hero in the mold of Matrosov. Although the hero has passed away for a year, his immortal deeds will forever inspire people to move forward.

	A young worker in Shanghai named Xu Jun, in a letter to the hero's mother, Deng Fangzhi, earnestly requested Deng Fangzhi to allow him to be her son. The letter expressed his determination to emulate the hero and work hard in production. A group in the Shanghai No. 3 Garment Factory, in the upsurge of striving to name the group after the hero, carried out a crash production and created outstanding achievements. Cao Lanying, a student at Beijing No. 13 Girls' Middle School and a member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, kept an article recording the hero's deeds in her League membership certificate. In a letter to the hero's mother, she said: "This way, it feels like Brother Jiguang is by my side. When I encounter difficulties, I have infinite strength to overcome them." She scored above 80 in most subjects in the final exam.

	In the past year, the hero's mother has received six or seven thousand letters. The letter writers include workers, farmers, students, and office staff, as well as collective letters from more than ten Huang Jiguang classes and Huang Jiguang groups named after the hero in schools in Zhejiang, Anhui, Chongqing, and others. There are also letters from Li Ruilian, a thirteen-year-old overseas Chinese student in Bandung, Indonesia, and Zhang Tiren, a seventy-year-old. They all unanimously told the hero's mother how they were striving forward under the inspiration of the hero's spirit.

	In the hero's hometown, there are also many examples of people doing good work and actively producing by learning from the hero's example. Before the Spring Festival this year, more than 4,600 members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League in Zhongjiang County wrote to the unit where Huang Jiguang served before his death, reporting on their work under the inspiration of Huang Jiguang's deeds, saying: 90 percent of the rural Youth League members in Zhongjiang County have participated in mutual aid teams, 98 people have become agricultural production models, and nearly 400 outstanding Youth League members have honorably joined the Chinese Communist Party from July last year to before the Spring Festival. The average test scores in Chinese and arithmetic of the Jiguang Class of Xiaonanjie Elementary School in Zhongjiang County reached 85 points.

	The farmers in Jiguang Township are working even harder to maintain the honor of the hero's hometown. The Youth League members and youths in the township have unparalleled love for the hero and the hero's mother, and everyone wants to do more for Mother Huang. During the autumn harvest, many farmers in the village took the initiative to help Mother Huang harvest crops. After the autumn harvest, Huang Jiguang's younger brother, Huang Jishu, went to Chengdu to study, and the family lacked labor. The youth and militia in the village immediately organized a farming team to help. Because the farmers throughout the township take care of Mother Huang and all the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers very thoughtfully, Jiguang Township has been rated as a model township for supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers in the district, and Sancun, where Deng Fangzhi lives, has been rated as a model village in the township.

	This year, the farmers in Jiguang Township overcame difficulties in seeds, fertilizers, and technology, and overcame various disasters, achieving a harvest that was 12 percent higher than last year. The farmers all said that they will continue to use the hero's spirit to maintain the honor of Jiguang Township, work hard to accumulate fertilizer and store water, and strive for a bumper harvest next year.

    英雄的精神永远鼓舞人们前进
    ——纪念黄继光烈士逝世一周年
    新华社记者  李朝
    十月十九日，是中国人民志愿军马特洛索夫式英雄黄继光光荣牺牲的日子。虽然英雄已逝世一年了，但他的不朽事迹永远鼓舞着人们前进。
    上海市一个名叫徐骏的青年工人，在给英雄的母亲邓芳芝的信中，恳求邓芳芝答应他做她的儿子。信中表示决心以英雄为榜样，努力生产。上海市被服三厂一个小组，在争取以英雄的名字命名小组的热潮中进行突击生产，创造了优异成绩。北京市十三女子中学学生、中国新民主主义青年团团员曹兰英在自己的团费证里，放着记载英雄事迹的文章。她在给英雄的母亲的信上说：“这样，就仿佛继光哥哥在我的身旁，遇着困难，我就有无穷的力量在克服它。”她在大考中，多数课都考了八十分以上。
    一年来，英雄的母亲共收到六七千封信。写信的有工人、农民、学生、机关工作人员，有浙江、安徽、重庆等地学校以英雄名字命名的十多个黄继光班和黄继光小组的集体信，有印度尼西亚万隆市十三岁的华侨学生李瑞联和七十岁的张体仁。他们都一致向英雄的母亲告诉了自己如何在英雄的精神鼓舞下努力前进的情形。
    在英雄的家乡，人们因学习英雄榜样而做好工作、积极生产的事情也是很多的。今年春节前夕，中江县四千六百多个中国新民主主义青年团团员，写信给黄继光生前所在部队，报告他们在黄继光事迹感召下的工作情况说：中江县农村青年团员百分之九十都参加了互助组，有九十八个人当了农业生产模范，从去年七月到春节前，并有近四百名优秀的青年团员光荣地加入中国共产党。中江县小南街小学的继光班全班国语、算术的平均考试成绩达到八十五分。
    继光乡农民更为保持英雄故乡的荣誉而努力。乡里的青年团员和青年们对英雄和英雄的母亲有着无比的热爱，谁都想给黄妈妈多做点事情。秋收时，全村很多农民主动帮助黄妈妈收庄稼。秋后，黄继光的弟弟黄继恕到成都去读书，家里缺乏劳动力，村上的青年和民兵马上组织了代耕队。由于全乡农民对黄妈妈和所有革命烈士家属和革命军人家属照顾得很周到，继光乡已被评为区的拥军优属模范乡，邓芳芝所在的三村又被评为全乡的模范村。
    今年，继光乡农民曾克服缺乏种籽、肥料和技术上的困难，并战胜了各种灾害，获得比去年增产百分之十二的丰收。农民们都表示要继续以英雄的精神，保持继光乡的荣誉，努力积肥蓄水，争取明年的大丰收。
