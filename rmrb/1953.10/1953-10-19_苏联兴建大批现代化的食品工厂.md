Xinhua News Agency, October 18th:

The Soviet Union is building a large number of modern food factories throughout the country, and many existing food factories are extensively implementing the automation and mechanization of major production processes.

According to TASS: This year, more than 100 meat factories, 89 butter and cheese factories, and 217 sugar refineries will be built throughout the Soviet Union. In the three years from 1954 to 1956, the Soviet Union will also build 1,600 huge food factories, including 720 butter and cheese factories, 144 meat product factories, 100 cheese factories, 50 canning factories, and fruit and vegetable processing factories. The newly built factories in various regions are very large in terms of production scale. For example, in the Russian Federation, a cheese factory equipped with new technological equipment has recently started operation in Stalingrad. This factory can produce more than 50 tons of milk and yogurt, about 5 tons of sour cream, more than 1,500 kilograms of ice cream, and various other dairy products every day; all operations in the factory are mechanized. An artificial butter factory being built in Saratov will be the largest artificial butter factory in the Soviet Union. It covers a total area of 26 hectares (15 mu per hectare) and will produce tens of thousands of tons of artificial butter, mayonnaise, and vegetable oil every year. The largest cannery in the Baltic coastal republics, the Pärnu Cannery, is being built at the mouth of the Pärnu River. This cannery will have the latest type of machines and will produce millions of cans of canned fish, thousands of tons of smoked and pickled fish, and hundreds of tons of industrial oils and fish meal every year. The meat product factory being built in Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian Republic, will produce several thousand tons of meat and sausages every day.

Automation, mechanization, and electrification are being widely implemented in Soviet food factories to further increase labor productivity. In the past 20 months, Soviet machine-building workers have produced nearly 100,000 automatic machines, semi-automatic machines, and continuous production devices for factories under the Ministry of Food Industry. In bread factories in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, and other cities, all operations from kneading to baking are automated. Recently, the Soviet Union has also designed 40 new types of machines for fish canneries and fish product factories. This year alone, 120 mechanized conveyor belts have been installed for pickling Khaza fish, Saraka fish, and herring. These conveyor belts can replace the laborious work of thousands of people, greatly improve the quality of products, and save 21.1 million rubles in the first eight months of this year. The Kiev fish product factory, with the help of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, has completed production experiments on preserving fish with electricity. Experiments have proved that high-voltage current can greatly shorten the smoking time of fish, requiring only one-sixth to one-ninth of the original time. The factory is now electrifying other smoking processes.

    苏联兴建大批现代化的食品工厂
    【新华社十八日讯】苏联全国各地正在兴建大批现代化的食品工厂，许多现有的食品工厂正在广泛地实行主要生产过程的自动化和机械化。
    据塔斯社消息：今年苏联各地将兴建一百多个肉类工厂，八十九个牛油和干酪工厂，二百一十七个炼糖工厂。在一九五四年到一九五六年三年间，苏联还要兴建一千六百个巨大的食品工厂，其中包括七百二十个牛油和干酪工厂、一百四十四个肉类制品工厂、一百个制酪工厂、五十个罐头工厂和水果、蔬菜的加工工厂。各地新建的工厂在生产规模上都是非常大的。例如，在俄罗斯联邦，斯大林格勒最近已有一个拥有新式技术设备的制酪工厂开工，这个工厂每天可生产五十多吨牛奶和酸牛奶、五吨左右酸奶油、一千五百多公斤冰激凌和其他各种乳产品；工厂的一切操作都是机械化的。在萨拉托夫兴建的一个人造牛油工厂，将是苏联最大的一个人造牛油工厂。它总计占地二十六公顷（每公顷合十五市亩），每年将生产几万吨人造牛油、蛋黄酱和植物油。波罗的海沿岸各共和国中最大的一个罐头厂——巴尔努罐头厂，正在巴尔努河入海的地方建造着。这个罐头厂将拥有最新型的机器，每年将生产几百万听鱼类罐头、几千吨熏鱼和腌鱼、几百吨工业用油脂和鱼粉。正在亚美尼亚共和国首都埃里温建造的肉类制品工厂，每天将生产几千吨肉类和腊肠。
    苏联食品工厂中正在广泛地实行自动化、机械化和电气化，以进一步提高劳动生产率。最近二十个月以来，苏联机器制造工人为食品工业部所属各工厂生产了将近十万台自动机、半自动机和连续生产装置。在莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅和其他一些城市的面包工厂内，从和面到烘烤的全部操作都是自动化的。最近，苏联还为鱼类罐头厂和鱼制品工厂设计了四十种新型的机器。单在今年就为哈萨鱼、萨拉卡鱼和青鱼的腌制装置了一百二十个机械化输送带。这些输送带可以代替几千个人的费力工作，大大地改进了产品的质量，并且在今年头八个月中就节省了二千一百万卢布。基辅的鱼制品工厂在乌克兰科学院的帮助下，已完成了用电力保藏鱼类的生产实验。实验证明，用高压电流可以使熏鱼的时间大大缩短，只需原来的时间的六分之一到九分之一。现在这个工厂正在使其他熏鱼的过程电气化。
