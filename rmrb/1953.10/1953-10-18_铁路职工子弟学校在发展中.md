Since liberation, with the raising of the political consciousness of railway workers and the appropriate improvement of their material lives, the number of workers' children requesting to attend school has increased significantly. Currently, the number of students in railway workers' children's schools has increased from more than 70,000 primary school students in 1949 to more than 160,000, approximately 2.3 times the number in 1949. The number of secondary school students has increased from more than 6,400 in 1949 to more than 28,000, approximately 4.3 times the number in 1949. Education funding has also been increasing year by year, increasing by more than 90% in the past three years.

The school buildings and facilities have been improved. Dilapidated buildings have been repaired, and new school buildings are being planned and constructed. In terms of facilities, all schools not only have neat desks and chairs, but also have books, instruments, and recreational and sports equipment.

The funding for railway workers' children's schools comes mainly from the "Chief's Fund" of each railway administration bureau in addition to the funding issued by the state. For example, the Wangchuanchang Primary School of Tianjin Railway Administration Bureau, which can now accommodate thirty-seven classes, was built last year with the "Chief's Fund"; the railway administrations in Beijing, Jinzhou, Jinan, Zhengzhou, Qiqihar, and Harbin have also used the "Chief's Fund" to build primary and secondary school buildings.

Thanks to the efforts of all railway workers, the attention of the leaders of the railway administration bureaus, and the close cooperation of the Party, administrative, and trade union organizations, by thinking of more ways, or using the Chief’s Fund to build school buildings, and running a two-shift system (there are currently 596 two-shift primary school classes and 36 two-shift secondary school classes), the problem of schooling for many workers' children has been solved.

    铁路职工子弟学校在发展中
    解放以后，由于铁路职工政治觉悟的提高，物质生活的适当改善，职工子弟要求入学的人数大量增加。目前铁路职工子弟学校学生人数，小学生已由一九四九年的七万余人增加到十六万余人，约等于一九四九年的二点三倍。中学生已由一九四九年的六千四百余人增加到二万八千余人，约等于一九四九年的四点三倍。教育经费，也是逐年增加着，三年来增加了百分之九十强。
    在校舍及学校设备方面，已有了改善。破烂不堪的都已修缮完整了；新校舍正在计划建筑中。设备方面，各校不但都有了整齐的桌椅，并且置备了图书仪器和文娱体育用品。
    铁路职工子弟学校经费的来源，除国家所发经费外，主要依靠各管理局的“首长基金”来解决。如天津铁路管理局现在能容三十七班学生的王串场小学，就是去年用“首长基金”建筑的；北京、锦州、济南、郑州、齐齐哈尔、哈尔滨等地的铁路管理局也用“首长基金”修建了小学和中学的校舍。
    由于全体铁路职工的努力、各地铁路管理局领导方面的重视，以及党、行政、工会组织的通力合作，多想办法，或用首长基金修建校舍，办二部制（现有二部制小学五百九十六班，二部制中学三十六班），解决了许多职工子弟的就学问题。
