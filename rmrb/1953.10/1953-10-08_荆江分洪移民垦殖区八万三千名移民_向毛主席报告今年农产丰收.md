    Eighty-Three Thousand Immigrants in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion and Reclamation Area
    Report to Chairman Mao on This Year's Bumper Harvest
    Respected Chairman Mao:
    We, the eighty-three thousand immigrants in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion and Reclamation Area, responded to your call last February and moved to the People's Great Embankment in Shishou for the benefit of the millions of people on both sides of the Jingjiang River. Under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party and the People's Government, we actively reclaimed land and engaged in production, achieving considerable harvests last year, and our living standards did not decline due to the relocation. This year, the People's Government has continued to provide strong economic support to us. All immigrants have actively engaged in production, consolidated and improved mutual aid teams, overcome disasters, and achieved a bumper harvest. The highest cotton yield is over 300 jin per mu, an increase of 10% to 20% compared to last year; the average rice yield is over 550 jin per mu, with the highest reaching 1,000 jin per mu, an increase of 20% to 30% compared to last year; sesame yields 8 dou per mu (1 dou is 20 jin), and sorghum yields more than 3 shi per mu (1 shi is 180 jin).
    Chairman Mao: We are not satisfied with such a bumper harvest. We pledge to you: we will do a good job in autumn plowing and fertilizer accumulation, continue to build small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, and gradually develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement on a voluntary basis, so as to continue to increase yield per unit area and produce more grain. In addition, we will sell surplus grain to the state and sell cotton to the state on a monthly basis to meet the needs of national economic construction and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

    荆江分洪移民垦殖区八万三千名移民
    向毛主席报告今年农产丰收
    敬爱的毛主席：
    我们荆江分洪移民垦殖区八万三千名移民，在去年二月响应你的号召，为了荆江两岸千百万人民的利益而迁移到石首的人民大垸。在共产党和人民政府的领导和扶助下，我们积极开荒生产，去年取得了相当收成，没有因迁移而降低生活水平。今年人民政府在经济上对我们继续大力扶助，全体移民积极生产，整顿提高互助组，战胜灾害，取得了丰收。棉花最高产量每市亩三百斤以上，比去年增产一成至二成；水稻平均产量每市亩在五百五十斤以上，最高的每市亩产一千斤，比去年增产二成至三成；芝麻每市亩合八斗（一斗二十斤），高粱每市亩收三石多（一石一百八十斤）。
    毛主席：我们并不以这样的丰收成绩为满足。我们向您提出保证：要做好秋耕和积肥工作，继续兴修小型农田水利工程，并在自愿基础上逐步发展互助合作运动，以继续提高单位面积产量，多打粮食。此外，还要把余粮卖给国家，把棉花分月卖给国家，以供应国家经济建设需要，巩固工农联盟。
