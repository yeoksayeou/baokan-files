    Mao Zedong Agricultural Production Cooperative
    By Gaihart Baoli, German Democratic Republic
    On the bank of a small lake in the central Mark region of the German Democratic Republic, there is a new village called Paulshof. It is just over an hour's journey from Berlin, the capital of Germany.
    Formerly, this land belonged to the landlord Karnow. After the Soviet army liberated the area in May 1945, the formerly oppressed farm laborers became the masters of the land. With the care of the state and the help of machine tractor stations, the farmers of Paulshof village established a new and better life. Next to the old, gloomy farmhouses, new farmhouses with clean windows and spacious rooms were built.
    The working farmers of Paulshof village realized that they could better use agricultural machinery and improve their lives by collectively farming the land. After detailed discussions, they established an agricultural production cooperative with five members on June 24, 1952. At the inaugural meeting, the members accepted the suggestion of Kaiser, the political director of the machine tractor station, to name their cooperative after Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people.
    For over a year, the cooperative has grown significantly. Now the cooperative has increased to fourteen members, managing over one hundred hectares of land. The benefits of cooperative production were already evident in the harvest of 1952. Thanks to the strong help and support of the machine tractor station, the members of the Mao Zedong Agricultural Production Cooperative were the first in the county to complete all autumn harvesting. After the crops were harvested, they immediately began plowing and sowing intermediate crops.
    The cooperative farmers of Paulshof village completed this year's spring plowing a month earlier than in previous years. All spring-sown grains and legumes were sown as early as March 20th this year. They started planting potatoes on April 2nd, planting ten hectares of early-maturing potatoes, five hectares of mid-maturing, and five hectares of late-maturing potatoes. With the help of Soviet potato planters, the planting was completed in just five days. While other agricultural production cooperatives were still starting to plant potatoes, the farmers of the Paulshof production cooperative were already working on soil moisture conservation for the potato fields. They have become the advanced workers among all the working farmers in the county.
    The achievements of the Paulshof production cooperative farmers do not stop there. They were the first in the county to complete the state's egg quota. By mid-July, they had paid the full year's milk quota, and then freely sold the remaining milk, thereby obtaining extra income. In addition, this year they also plan to pay an extra ten pigs to further improve the living standards of the working people.
    The director of the production cooperative, Herr Hvert, is an immigrant from another area. A few years ago, when he and his wife and children arrived in Paulshof village with backpacks, they were only allocated land and a small cow. Now, in addition to the land he has invested in, he also has a beautiful new farmhouse, a horse, six cows, and sixteen pigs, and completed the number of pigs to be paid in June this year.
    Hvert happily said: "Now we are working for ourselves, so it is always very pleasant to go to work in the fields. Our lives have also changed. This year on May Day, our cooperative held a grand celebration and slaughtered a calf. Our cultural activities have also become richer. In our cultural recreation room with the portrait of the Chinese people's leader Mao Zedong hanging, there are often dances and concerts. Those farmers who have not yet joined the cooperative also often come here."
    Other cooperative members have similar lives to the Hvert family.
    Since all members joined the cooperative with approximately equal land (eight hectares), the income they receive from collective farming is also approximately the same. However, the prerequisite is that everyone must also complete the same amount of workdays on average. According to the cooperative's production plan and distribution plan, each hectare of land invested can be allocated 144.5 kilograms of grain (including rye, wheat, feed, and oats, etc.), 1.5 kilograms of oilseeds, and 400 kilograms each of potatoes and radishes. In addition, members can also get some cash income. If the income from raising livestock, orchards, and free sales is also calculated, then the income of the members is much more than before. This is because the cultivated land can be better cultivated after the merger, and the most advanced agricultural science and technology experience—especially the Soviet experience—can be widely applied.
    The farmers of the Paulshof cooperative have direct and close ties with the workers and have received their help in various tasks. They signed a friendship contract with the workers of the Berlin East Railway Station administration. The friendship contract stipulates that the worker brothers of Berlin East Railway Station guarantee to send people to assist the farmers of the cooperative during their rest time when the harvest work is the busiest, so that they will not delay the autumn harvest and the deadline for paying public grain. In addition, the workers of the East Railway Station also help the farmers of the cooperative repair small-scale machines and farm implements, and provide manpower assistance in cultural education. The workers presented the production cooperative with a pennant with the words "Mao Zedong Agricultural Production Cooperative" and a wall newspaper board with the inscription "Mao Zedong Agricultural Production Cooperative Speaks Here." They also promised to guide and assist cooperative member Haas's accounting work.
    On the other hand, the farmers of the cooperative guarantee in the friendship contract to complete the production tasks on schedule and pay the first batch of grain to the state. They decided to continuously increase the yield per unit area by improving labor organization and applying advanced agricultural science and technology—especially Soviet agricultural science and technology. In addition to paying a certain amount of products to the state, the cooperative uses the remaining products to supply the worker brothers of the East Railway Station, so that they can get more food supply. Workers and working farmers thus help each other sincerely. Whenever there are festivals and grand gatherings, they also send representatives to hold friendship parties.
    The workers and working farmers of the German Democratic Republic are happily and confidently creating a happier and better life together. They take the workers and Chinese working farmers and their great leader Mao Zedong as their example. The urban and rural working people of China and the German Democratic Republic are jointly fighting in the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union to further improve people's lives and defend world peace.

    毛泽东农业生产合作社
    德意志民主共和国  盖哈特·保利
    在德意志民主共和国马克州中部的一个小湖边上，有一个名叫保尔斯霍夫的新农村。从德国的首都柏林到那里只要一个多小时的路程。
    从前，这里的土地是属于地主卡诺夫的。一九四五年五月苏军解放了这里以后，原来被压迫的雇农就变成了土地的主人。在国家的关怀和机器拖拉机站的帮助下，保尔斯霍夫村的农民们建立了新的美好的生活。在旧的、阴暗的农庄旁边，新建了有洁净的窗户和宽敞房间的新农舍。
    保尔斯霍夫村的劳动农民们认识到通过共同经营土地就可以更好地使用农业机器和改善生活，因而他们在经过详细的讨论后，于一九五二年六月二十四日成立了一个有五个社员的农业生产合作社。在成立大会上，社员们接受了机器拖拉机站政治主任凯赛尔的建议，决定以中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东的名字来命名自己的合作社。
    一年多来，这个合作社有了很大的发展。现在合作社社员已经增加到十四名，经营的土地共有一百多公顷。从一九五二年的收获中就已经显示出合作生产的好处。由于机器拖拉机站的大力帮助和支持，毛泽东农业生产合作社的社员们在全县最先完成了全部秋收工作。庄稼收割完以后，立刻就着手耕地，并播种了中间作物。
    保尔斯霍夫村的合作社农民较往年提前一个月完成了今年的春耕工作。全部春季播种的谷物和豆类早在今年三月二十日就已经种完了。四月二日他们已开始种马铃薯了；共种了十公顷的早熟马铃薯、五公顷中熟的和五公顷晚熟的马铃薯。在苏联马铃薯播种机的帮助下，只用五天时间就完成了播种工作。当旁的农业生产合作社还在开始种植马铃薯的时候，保尔斯霍夫生产合作社的农民们都已在进行马铃薯地的保墒工作。他们已成了县里所有劳动农民中的先进者了。
    保尔斯霍夫生产合作社农民们的成绩还不止此。他们在全县第一个完成了向国家缴纳的鸡蛋数额。在七月中他们就缴纳了全年应缴的牛奶量，然后就将剩余的牛奶自由出售，由此而获得了额外的收入。此外，今年他们还准备额外缴纳十头猪，以进一步改善劳动人民的生活水平。
    生产合作社主任赫维尔特是外地来的移民。几年以前，他和他的妻儿背着背包来到保尔斯霍夫村的时候，只分到了土地和一条小母牛，而现在他们除了已经入股的土地之外，还有一座漂亮的新农舍，有了一匹马、六头牛和十六头猪，并在今年六月份就完成了应缴纳的猪的数量。
    赫维尔特高兴地说：“现在我们是为自己工作了，所以在下地干活时总是很愉快的。我们的生活也变样了。今年五一节，我们社里举行了一个隆重的庆祝会，还宰了一头小牛。我们的文化活动也丰富起来了。在我们挂着中国人民领袖毛泽东像的那间文化休息室里，常常有跳舞和音乐会。那些还没有参加合作社的农民们也常常上这里来。”
    别的合作社社员也有着和赫维尔特家庭类似的生活。
    由于所有的社员都带着差不多相等的土地（八公顷）加入合作社，所以他们从共同耕种的工作中所获得的收入也是差不多一样的。不过先决的条件是大家也都要平均地干完同样劳动日的工作。按照合作社的生产计划和分配计划，入股的每一公顷土地可以分配到一百四十四点五公斤谷物（包括稞麦、小麦、饲料和燕麦等），一点五公斤油籽，马铃薯和萝卜各四百公斤。除此之外，社员们还能得到一些现金的收入。如果再把饲养牲畜以及果园和自由销售所得的收入计算进去，那么社员们的收入就比从前多得多了。这是因为耕地合并以后能够更好地耕种，并且可以广泛地运用最先进的农业科学和技术的经验——尤其是苏联的经验的缘故。
    保尔斯霍夫合作社的农民们和工人们有着直接的密切联系，并在各种工作上得到了他们的帮助。他们和柏林东火车站的铁路管理处的工人们签订了一个友好合同。在友好合同内规定，柏林东火车站的工人兄弟们保证在收割工作最繁忙的时候，利用休息时间派人协助合作社的农民，使他们不致耽误秋收和缴纳公粮的期限。此外，东火车站的工人们还帮助合作社的农民修理小规模的机器和农具，并在文化教育方面提供人力上的帮助。工人们曾赠送给生产合作社一面写着“毛泽东农业生产合作社”的锦旗和一块题着“毛泽东农业生产合作社在这里讲话”的墙报板。他们并且保证指导和协助生产合作社社员哈斯的会计工作。
    另一方面，合作社的农民则在友好合同内保证如期完成生产任务，并将第一批粮食缴纳给国家。他们决定要通过改进劳动组织和运用先进农业科学和技术——特别是苏联的农业科学技术，来不断地提高单位面积产量。合作社除了向国家缴纳一定的产品以外，就用剩余的产品供应给东火车站的工人兄弟们，使他们得到更多的食物供应。工人和劳动农民就这样真诚地互相帮助。每逢什么节日盛会的时候，他们还互派代表举行友谊联欢。
    德意志民主共和国的工人和劳动农民正在愉快地、满怀信心地共同创造着更加幸福美好的生活。他们以中国的工人和中国劳动农民和他们伟大的领袖毛泽东作为自己的榜样。中国和德意志民主共和国的城乡劳动人民在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营里为进一步改善人民生活和保卫世界和平而共同奋斗着。（附图片）
