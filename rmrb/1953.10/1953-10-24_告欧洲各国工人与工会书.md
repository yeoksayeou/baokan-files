To the Working Men and Women and their Trade Unions of Europe!

The Third World Congress of Trade Unions, in the name of the 88,600,000 workers represented by the delegates attending this Congress, writes you this letter.

For the third time in this century, ominous clouds are looming over Europe. International reactionaries, colluding with the Adenauer government, are trying to revive West German fascism and militarism, and are attempting to turn the German people into the main strike force of a military aggressor bloc. The Bonn government is establishing an army at an ever-increasing pace, manufacturing warships and military aircraft, and stepping up the production of war materials and ammunition. West German industry has become an arsenal for a new war. Generals of Hitler's Wehrmacht and war criminals have been released.

Supported by the American imperialists and with the connivance of Western governments, Adenauer is brandishing his butcher's knife and openly announcing his plans for revenge. His policy is a constant threat to the united action of workers and their trade unions.

War-mongers are alarmed by the development of the forces of peace and are therefore resorting to all kinds of adventures and provocations.

Dear Comrades!

You still clearly remember the atrocities and hardships of the Second World War – the torture chambers of Buchenwald and Auschwitz, the ruins of Stalingrad and Coventry, the ashes of Lidice and Oradour, the millions upon millions of adults and children slaughtered and tortured by Hitler's executioners.

The consequences of the war can still be seen everywhere today. Among you, there are many disabled people, many orphans and widows, many men and women who lost their relatives during the terrible years of the war. A new war would plunge humanity into unprecedented catastrophe. Methods of mass destruction, atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, would turn entire countries into desolate deserts.

War brings suffering and poverty to workers, but it brings huge profits to capitalists. This is one of the reasons why monopoly capitalists increase war budgets, accelerate arms expansion, and constantly subject the people of all countries to the terror of new bloodshed.

The implementation of the Bonn and Paris treaties is one way to help and accelerate the rearmament and remilitarization of West Germany. The remilitarization of West Germany has dangerous consequences for the peaceful coexistence of the people of Europe and for the peace of the whole world. This is first and foremost a great threat to the German people themselves. The war that the imperialists are hastily preparing will subject the German people to a new and more terrible national catastrophe.

Workers of West Germany!

We call on you to intensify the struggle to win the united action of the working class, to establish a united front of all democratic forces to prevent the rekindling of the flames of war in West Germany, and to repel the threat to European and world peace. Do not forget that you have a great responsibility to prevent the revival of fascism and militarism in Germany. Workers of the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party, workers of the Christian Democratic Party, non-party workers, trade unions of West Germany, we call on you to unite with all the workers of all countries in Europe. Do not continue to remain outside the broad workers' struggle movement that has the power to decisively stop the Bonn and Paris treaties.

Working Men and Women of Europe!

To prevent war, you must immediately oppose the revival of the West German aggressive army.

Close your ranks, strengthen your united action, and show determination and courage in the struggle against the revival of fascism and against preparations for aggression.

Unite more closely in brotherly solidarity with the German workers who are fighting against the Adenauer government's aggressive plans. Whether Germany chooses the path of militarism and aggression or the path of peace and friendship among all peoples will depend on your unity, your concerted action, and the determination of the German workers.

It is the responsibility of all of us to help the peace forces in West Germany in their struggle against the policy of war and to actively support the actions of the workers and trade unions of the German Democratic Republic in their struggle for peace.

Unite and join the struggle against the ratification of war treaties that Eisenhower and Adenauer are arrogantly demanding the parliaments of France, Italy, Belgium, and Luxembourg to ratify. Smash the evil schemes of those who want to continue Hitler's adventurous policies.

United, you are a powerful and decisive force.

Stop the heinous plans that will be implemented once the Bonn and Paris treaties are ratified and enforced!

Defend peace and the national independence of all peoples!

Long live the great unity of the workers of all countries!

### 告欧洲各国工人与工会书

专栏：

    告欧洲各国工人与工会书欧洲各国男女工人和他们的工会！
    世界工会第三次代表大会以派有代表出席这次大会的八千八百六十万工人的名义给你们写这封信。
    在这一世纪中，不祥的乌云笼罩着欧洲已经是第三次了。国际反动派勾结阿登纳政府，正在设法复活西德的法西斯主义和军国主义，并企图把德国人民变成军事侵略集团的主要突击军。波恩政府在愈来愈快地建立军队，它在制造军舰和军用飞机，并在加紧制造战争物资与弹药。西德的工业变成了新战争的兵工厂。希特勒国防军的将领、战争罪犯们被释放了。
    阿登纳在美帝国主义者的支持和西方国家政府的串通下，震响着他的屠刀，并公开宣布了他的报复计划。他的政策对于工人的一致行动和他们的工会是一个经常的威胁。
    战争贩子看到和平力量的发展而惶惶不安，因而使用种种冒险和挑衅手段。
    亲爱的同志们！
    第二次世界大战中的暴行与困苦，你们还会清楚记得——布痕瓦尔德和奥斯威辛的酷刑室，斯大林格勒和考文垂的废墟，利台斯和奥拉多尔的灰烬，受希特勒刽子手屠杀和拷打的千千万万成人和儿童。
    战争的结果今天还到处可以看得见。在你们中间，有许多残废的人，许多孤儿寡妇，有许多男男女女在战争的可怕年代中失去了他们的亲属。新的战争会把人类投入空前的浩劫。大规模毁灭办法，原子弹和氢弹会把整个整个的国家变成荒凉的沙漠。
    战争给工人带来痛苦和穷困，却给资本家带来巨额利润。这就是垄断资本家增加战争预算，加速扩军并使各国人民不断处于新流血的恐怖中的一个原因。
    执行波恩与巴黎条约是帮助并加速西德重整军备以及重新军国主义化的办法之一。西德重新军国主义化对欧洲各国人民的和平共处，对全世界的和平共处有着危险的结果。这首先对于德国人民自己是一个巨大威胁。帝国主义者正在仓促准备的战争将使德国人民遭到一个新的、更可怕的民族浩劫。
    西德的工人们！
    我们要求你们加紧斗争，来争取工人阶级的一致行动，争取成立一个团结所有民主力量的阵线，以防止在西德从新燃起战火，打退对欧洲和平与世界和平的威胁。不要忘记你们有重大责任防止法西斯主义与军国主义在德国复活。社会民主党和共产党的工人们，基督教民主党的工人们，无党派的工人们，西德的各个工会，我们要求你们与欧洲所有国家的所有工人联合起来。不要继续留在有力量决定性地制止波恩与巴黎条约的广大的工人斗争运动之外。
    欧洲的男女工人们！
    为防止战争，你们必须立刻反对西德侵略军队复活。
    紧密你们的队伍，加强你们的一致行动，在反对法西斯主义复活，反对侵略准备的斗争中表现出决心与勇气。
    更紧密地与正为反对阿登纳政府的侵略计划进行斗争的德国工人兄弟般地团结起来。德国将选择什么道路，军国主义与侵略的道路呢，还是和平与各国人民友好的道路呢，这将决定于你们的团结、你们的一致行动以及德国工人的决心。
    我们大家都有责任帮助西德的和平力量进行反对战争政策的斗争，并积极支持德意志民主共和国的工人与工会争取和平的行动。
    团结起来，参加反对批准战争条约的斗争，艾森豪威尔与阿登纳正蛮横地要求法、意、比、卢议会批准这些战争条约。粉碎那些要继续执行希特勒的冒险政策的人的罪恶阴谋。
    团结起来，你们就是一支强大的、决定性的力量。
    制止一旦波恩与巴黎条约批准与执行而将实施的罪恶滔天的计划！
    保卫和平与各国人民的民族独立！
    世界各国工人大团结万岁！
