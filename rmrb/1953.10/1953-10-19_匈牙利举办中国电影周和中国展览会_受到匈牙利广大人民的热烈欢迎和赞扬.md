    【新华社布拉格十八日电】布达佩斯消息：匈牙利对外文化协会为庆祝我国国庆节在布达佩斯和其他十大城市同时举行的“中国电影周”，已在七日胜利结束。在电影周中放映的我国电影，受到了匈牙利人民的热烈欢迎。仅在布达佩斯一地，观众即达四万五千人。匈牙利各大报纸都发表了评论和文章，赞扬我国人民电影事业的成就。“自由人民报”刊载米克洛斯·科洛的文章说：正在发展中的中国电影，以它的朴素的、人人易懂的艺术表现手法、明确的思想内容和强烈的感染力，使观众们获得了丰富的教益。“匈牙利民族报”发表文章说：在这次电影周中放映的影片，显示出中国电影事业目前所取得的成就，已为它今后的日益加强和迅速发展提供了条件。伟大的中国人民的无穷尽的力量，是中国电影事业发展的保证。
    十月一日起在布达佩斯举行的“中国是和平的国家——中国治淮工程和彩色木刻画展览会”，展出了我国治淮工程的图片、敦煌壁画和现代艺术作品。展览会也受到匈牙利人民的欢迎。截至目前为止，观众已达一万五千多人。“匈牙利民族报”发表评论说：这些图片报道了中国在改造自然方面所进行的巨大工程。该报指出：敦煌壁画是表现出丰富的想像力和高度文化的无名作家的生动的作品。在谈到展览会上陈列的齐白石的作品时，该报说：不论他画的是树枝上的小鸟或是蝴蝶，他都刻画出生活的景象。该报最后说：参观的人看到这个和平国家的情形时，会发生一种骄傲和热爱的感情。因为我们祖国和这个国家的距离，远比地图上所显示的距离要近得多。
