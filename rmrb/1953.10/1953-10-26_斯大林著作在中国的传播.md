    The first volume of the Chinese edition of "The Complete Works of Stalin" has been published. The publication of the Complete Works of Stalin and the large-scale printing of the works of Marx, Engels, and Lenin are the greatest happiness for the Chinese people. Over the past thirty years, under the guidance of the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, the Chinese people have won great victories in the revolution. In the future, we will continue to rely on it to advance towards socialism and communism.

    After Lenin's death, Stalin led the Soviet people in building socialism and defeating fascism, guiding the liberation movements of people all over the world, comprehensively developing Marxism-Leninism, and advancing Marxism-Leninism to new heights. Stalin also dedicated his lofty wisdom to the Chinese revolution. The Chinese Communist Party constantly studies Stalin's works, just as they constantly study the works of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. It is precisely because of adhering to this study that the Chinese Communist Party has grown and developed vigorously.

    The dissemination of Stalin's works in China began thirty years ago.

    The earliest of Stalin's works to be introduced to China was his outstanding theoretical work, "Foundations of Leninism." This book was introduced by the famous Communist comrades Qu Qiubai and Jiang Guangchi (Jiang Guangchi). We can see Jiang Guangchi's translation of "The Principle of the National Question in Leninism" (i.e., Chapter 6, "The National Question" of "Foundations of Leninism") in the fourth issue of the "New Youth" quarterly published on December 20, 1924, and Qu Qiubai's abridged translation of the article "An Overview of Leninism" in the first issue of "New Youth" published on April 22, 1925. In addition, starting with the 106th issue of "Chinese Youth" published on December 29, 1925, the first to fourth chapters of "Foundations of Leninism" were serialized under the title "The Theory and Practice of Leninism." Because the separate edition of this work was published in Guangzhou in early 1926, the journal stopped continuing the serialization.

    From the founding of the Chinese Communist Party to the Second Revolutionary Civil War, Stalin's works began to be disseminated gradually and widely through revolutionary progressive publications, internal publications of the Chinese Communist Party, and various mimeographed pamphlets, openly or secretly, guiding and encouraging the development of the Chinese people's revolutionary movement.

    Due to the long-term war and white terror, only a very few of these publications and pamphlets have been preserved by those who were interested. These books have now become part of the historical relics of the Chinese revolution and precious souvenirs of the Chinese people's publishing industry.

    From these souvenirs, we can see that during the First and Second Revolutionary Civil Wars, the separate edition of "Foundations of Leninism," as well as later the separate edition combining this work with "Some Questions Concerning Leninism," were disseminated in various versions in many places, becoming textbooks for Chinese Communists and the Chinese revolutionary people to study Marxism-Leninism. In many occasions, this work was solemnly published. For example, the title page of the 1928 re-edition (first edition in 1927) of "An Overview of Leninism" (i.e., "Foundations of Leninism") published by "New Youth Society" was printed with "Contributing this translation to the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party." This book was also reprinted by the Political Department of the 12th Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in November 1931 and widely distributed in the Red base areas to commemorate the opening of the First National Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers' Representatives. The combined edition of the above two works was published in Shanghai in 1930, using the title "Lenin" (World Science Research Association Series). In February 1933, the Political Department of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army School reprinted this combined edition under the title "An Overview of Leninism." This book was printed with 10,000 copies using Fujian native paper.

    After the Communist Party of the Soviet Union achieved a decisive victory in restoring the national economy, Stalin's important work that led the Soviet state to a new historical stage – "Political Report of the Central Committee to the Fourteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" (December 18, 1925) – was immediately introduced to China at that time. The summaries of this report were published on the 218th and 219th issues of the "Worker's Road" daily newspaper published by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Canton-Hong Kong Strike Committee in Guangzhou on January 31 and February 1, 1926, and the fifth issue of "New Youth" published on July 25, 1926, the former titled "The Soviet Economic Situation and Its Policy," the latter titled "An Overview of Soviet Politics and Economy." Stalin's reports at the 15th, 16th, and 17th Congresses of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) were also quickly translated after their publication. Among them, "Report on the Work of the Central Committee to the Seventeenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" was published by the Shanghai China Bookstore in the same year (1934).

    Stalin's works on national and colonial questions are important guiding documents for the revolutionary movements of colonial and semi-colonial peoples. Now we can see the translation of "Marxism and the National Question" published by the Shanghai Yangtze River Bookstore on March 15, 1933. Stalin's "On the National Question in Yugoslavia" and "Once Again on the National Question" were also translated in 1933. Prior to this, there was also a collection of works by Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, "Marxist Theory of National Revolution," published by "New Youth Society" in 1927.

    During the above period, Stalin's other important works were also continuously introduced to China. We can cite the following examples.

    The 23rd issue of the first volume of "Lenin Youth" published on September 10, 1929, translated "The Opposition's Mistakes in the Chinese Revolution" (i.e., Part 2 "On China" of "Brief Commentary on Current Issues"). In the first and second issues of the second volume of the journal published in October of the same year, the article "The Soviet Industrialization and the Anti-Rightist Struggle" (i.e., "On the Industrialization of the Country and the Right Deviation in the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)") was serialized.

    The combined second and third issues of the third volume of "Bolshevik" published on March 15, 1930, translated "The Year of Great Change" (i.e., "The Year of Great Turn").

    The first issue of the first volume of the monthly "Communist International" published in February 1930, translated "Comrade Stalin's Speech at the Conference of Marxist Agriculturalists" (i.e., "Some Questions Concerning the Land Policy of the USSR").

    The 32nd issue of "Red Flag Weekly" published on March 18, 1932, translated "On Some Questions in the History of Bolshevism" (i.e., "On Some Questions in the History of Bolshevism").

    The third issue of the third volume of "Youth Truth" weekly published on December 10, 1933, translated the article "The Tasks of the Youth League" (i.e., "On the Tasks of the Communist Youth League").

    The above books and periodicals were mostly published and distributed in a severe war environment and an environment of white terror. The broad revolutionary people loved Stalin's works, and they used various methods to reprint them. The booklet "Stalin on Lenin" printed by the CCP Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Provincial Committee in Ruijin on October 15, 1934, was mimeographed on one side of local paper, with a brief biography of Stalin attached at the end.

    In 1926, Stalin's collection of essays, "Problems of Leninism," was published in the Soviet Union. In the following ten years, this book became the most widely circulated of Stalin's works. In January 1934, when the fifth anti-encirclement campaign was in full swing, the CCP Central Bureau in Ruijin published "Problems of Leninism" (including twelve articles by Stalin). This book was published as a gift to celebrate the National Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers' Representatives held at that time.

    As is well known, the Chinese versions of Lenin and Stalin's works published in the Soviet Union played a huge role in the Chinese people's study of Marxism-Leninism. As early as during the First and Second Revolutionary Civil Wars in our country, the Foreign Workers' Publishing House in the Soviet Union published a large number of Chinese versions of Stalin's works, including various separate editions and two volumes of "Problems of Leninism" (published in 1935). These books were continuously transported to China despite the isolation of the counter-revolution, giving great support to the Chinese revolutionary people.

    Throughout the First and Second Revolutionary Civil Wars, the Party overcame various difficulties and gradually disseminated Stalin's works among the broad revolutionary cadres and people.

    After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese revolution entered a new climax. During the Anti-Japanese War and the Third Revolutionary Civil War—the years when the Chinese people's revolutionary movement flourished until it achieved national victory—Stalin's works were introduced to China more extensively and systematically. Under the call of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communists launched a movement to study Marxism-Leninism. Regarding this, Comrade Chen Boda once said in his essay "Stalin and the Chinese Revolution": "Comrade Mao Zedong had the opportunity to broadly read Stalin's works during the Anti-Japanese War. Comrade Mao Zedong used the highest enthusiasm to read and deeply deliberate on the various works of Stalin he obtained." "Stalin's doctrines, Stalin's methods and theories, after being introduced and applied by Comrade Mao Zedong, greatly enlightened the broad vision of the Chinese Communists in politics and ideology, improved the Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the Chinese Communists, and helped our Party have sufficient ideological strength to defeat any counter-revolution and any enemy hindering the progress of the revolution."

    In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, whether in the anti-Japanese base areas or in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, Stalin's outstanding theoretical work "Foundations of Leninism" and his brilliant collection of essays "Problems of Leninism" and "Marxism and the National Question" had relatively complete translations. In May 1938, the Shanghai Seed Society also published Stalin's another collection of essays "On the Opposition."

    In 1940, the Chinese version of "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks): Short Course" was published by the Liberation Press in Yan'an (published in Shanghai in the same year under the name "China Publishing House"). The publication of this great work by Stalin (1938) was a major event in the ideological and political life of communists around the world. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his report "Reform Our Study" published in 1941: "'The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks): Short Course' is the highest synthesis and summary of the world communist movement in the past 100 years, and it is a typical example of the combination of theory and practice, and it is the only complete typical example in the world. We can see how Lenin and Stalin combined the universal truth of Marxism with the specific practice of the Soviet revolution and thus developed Marxism, and we can know how we should work in China." Comrade Mao Zedong instructed the entire Party to study Marxism-Leninism with this great work as the central material. The Chinese Communists responded to Comrade Mao Zedong's call and enthusiastically studied "The History of the CPSU (B)."

    In 1942, the Chinese Communists conducted Marxist-Leninist education throughout the Party in the form of a rectification movement. Stalin's articles on the Bolshevization of the Party, the Conclusion to "The History of the CPSU (B)," Stalin on Leadership and Inspection, Stalin on Self-Criticism, Lenin, Stalin, etc. on Party Discipline and Party Democracy, Stalin on Egalitarianism, etc. were all listed as rectification documents. All Party cadres carefully studied these works and teachings of Stalin and conducted self-examination of their own ideology and work style. During the rectification movement and for a long time thereafter, these documents were repeatedly edited and published, becoming an important guide and motto for Chinese Communists to improve their work style. Since then, the propaganda departments at all levels of the Party and the Party newspapers in various places have also frequently compiled relevant parts of Lenin and Stalin's works to solve major problems in their work at the time, as theoretical guidance.

    Stalin's works on the Chinese revolution, his insightful predictions about the Chinese revolution, and his important instructions on the nature of the Chinese revolution and the strategic issues of the Chinese revolution, were significant contributions to the Chinese revolution. These works were also systematically compiled within the Party after the 1942 rectification movement. In July 1944, the Secretariat of the CCP Central Committee compiled and printed "Lenin, Stalin, and the Communist International on China" in Yan'an, which included 23 works by Stalin. Later, the Liberation Press published "Lenin and Stalin on China," enabling the entire Party and the people of the country to systematically study Lenin and Stalin's theories on the Chinese revolution.

    During the Anti-Japanese War and the Third Revolutionary Civil War, although the Party was in a severe war environment, Stalin's newly published works, from the "Report on the Work of the Central Committee to the 18th Party Congress" in 1939 to the speeches during the Soviet Patriotic War and after the war, could be translated and published at any time. The Party quickly mastered the two powerful weapons of broadcasting (the establishment of the Xinhua News Agency) and newspapers (the large-scale publication of newspapers in various liberated areas). Every speech and every communiqué of Stalin during the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union was quickly disseminated throughout the Party through broadcasting, newspapers, and printed pamphlets, becoming an extremely important source of encouragement for the entire Party and the entire army during the Anti-Japanese War. In 1945, the Shanghai Times Publishing House published Stalin's collection of essays "On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union."

    In the years of war, the Party always made great efforts to translate and publish the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. From Yan'an to various liberated areas to the Kuomintang-controlled areas, various classic works were constantly being reprinted. The publication of the "Selected Works of Stalin" was a significant sign of this effort. In January 1939, Yan'an, under difficult material conditions, published the five-volume "Selected Works of Stalin," collecting 59 important works by Stalin. The entire book had a total of 1,768 pages. This "Selected Works of Stalin" was also published in Shanghai in 1940 under the name "China Publishing House." In 1941, in the fighting Taihang area, the North China Branch of the Xinhua Daily also reprinted 3,000 copies. These 3,000 books were printed under extremely difficult material conditions. The entire book was printed on one side of various colors of glazed paper such as pink, green, yellow, and white, folded into double pages and bound together. In September 1949, the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore reprinted this selection again, dividing it into a popular edition and a hardcover edition, which circulated throughout the country. This hardcover edition was already printed on woodfree paper.

    National liberation and the establishment of the People's Republic of China created conditions for the large-scale publication of the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. It has become possible for the Chinese people to study Marxism-Leninism on a national scale and on a mass scale.

    As early as the beginning of 1949, Comrade Mao Zedong called on the entire Party to strengthen theoretical study and prescribed twelve essential books for cadres to read. Among them, the four books "Foundations of Leninism," "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks): Short Course," "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction" (two volumes), and "Lenin and Stalin on China" included many important works by Stalin. When the war was still going on, many Party cadres enthusiastically responded to Comrade Mao Zedong's call and began to read these works one by one. These twelve essential books for cadres, after being published in unified versions starting in 1949, have been distributed in large quantities and have become basic reading materials for cadres to study Marxism-Leninism on their own.

    Stalin's brilliant work "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," published in June 1950, was an outstanding contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. After the publication of the translation of this work, it had a huge impact on China's academic work. It gave the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people new and powerful ideological weapons.

    In October 1952, Stalin's new great work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" was published. In this work, Stalin comprehensively discussed the fundamental problems of socialist political economy, pointed out the path from socialism to communism, summarized the experience of Soviet socialist construction and international revolutionary movements, and creatively enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism. After the publication of the Chinese version of this work, more than 960,000 copies were distributed in November alone. In its instruction calling on the entire Party to study "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," the CCP Central Committee pointed out that this work was not only an important development for Marxism, but also had great guiding significance for our country's economic construction, and required senior Party cadres to first seriously study this work in order to guide the study of general cadres. In the past six months, the vast number of cadres across the country have responded to the call of the CCP Central Committee, forming a upsurge in studying Stalin's works and the documents of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and laying a good foundation for subsequent theoretical study by cadres.

    Recently, cadres at all levels across the country are unfolding the study of Soviet socialist economic construction problems centered on Chapters 9-12 of "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks): Short Course," in accordance with the CCP Central Committee's instructions on cadre theoretical education for 1953-1954.

    In line with the constantly rising study movement, Stalin's works have been published in large quantities in recent years. From 1949 to June 1953, the People's Publishing House printed a total of 41 kinds of Stalin's works (including 7 co-authored works), with a total printing volume of 6,600,400 copies. Among them, 608,000 copies were printed in 1949, 1,049,000 copies were printed in 1950, 135,000 copies were printed in 1951, 1,842,000 copies were printed in 1952, and 2,970,000 copies were printed in the first half of 1953.

    Among the above 41 kinds of works:
    "Foundations of Leninism" was printed 28 times, with a total of 374,000 copies,
    "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks): Short Course" was printed 28 times, with a total of 330,000 copies,
    "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" was printed 17 times, with a total of 1,335,000 copies,
    "Speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" was printed 13 times, with a total of 771,000 copies,
    "Lenin and Stalin on China" was printed 20 times, with a total of 218,000 copies,
    Volume 1 of "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction" was printed 24 times, with a total of 218,000 copies, and Volume 2 was printed 23 times, with a total of 185,000 copies,
    A total of 716,000 copies of the advanced and intermediate group books of "On the Socialist Economic Construction of the Soviet Union" have been printed as of the end of June this year.

    Since 1949, the International Bookstore has also ordered a large number of Chinese versions of Stalin's works from the Soviet Foreign Languages Publishing House, totaling more than 3,519,000 copies. Among them, the number of goods received in 1949 was more than 464,200 copies, the number of goods received in 1950 was more than 1,800,660 copies, the number of goods received in 1951 was more than 364,100 copies, the number of goods received in 1952 was more than 195,600 copies, and the number of goods received from January to August 1953 was more than 690,000 copies. Among these more than 3,519,000 copies, "Concise Course on the History of the CPSU (B)" accounted for more than 628,000 copies.

    In this way, from 1949 to the first half of 1953, the number of Chinese versions of Stalin's various works distributed in China has exceeded 10 million copies.

    From these figures, we can also see how much the Chinese people love Stalin's works since national liberation and how they study Stalin's theories with increasingly high enthusiasm.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said in his article "The Greatest Friendship" written in mourning for Stalin's death:
    "All of Comrade Stalin's works are immortal Marxist documents. His 'Foundations of Leninism', 'History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union', and his last great work 'Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR' are encyclopedias of Marxism-Leninism and syntheses of the experience of the world communist movement over the past century. His speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a valuable last will and testament to the communists of all countries in the world. We Chinese communists, like the communists of all countries in the world, go to Comrade Stalin's great works to find the path to our victory."

    He also said:
    "Since Lenin's death, Comrade Stalin has always been the central figure in the world communist movement. We have rallied around him, constantly consulted him, and constantly drawn ideological strength from his works."

    For more than 30 years, it is precisely in this way that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have constantly drawn ideological strength from Stalin's works, followed the great theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and achieved historical victories. The dissemination of Stalin's works in China over the past 30 years also illustrates this point.

    Now, our country has entered a period of construction. The theories of Lenin and Stalin guiding Soviet socialist construction are of great guiding significance to us. At this time, the Chinese version of "The Complete Works of Stalin" has begun to be published, which is such a cause for rejoicing! The volumes of the Chinese version of "The Complete Works of Stalin" will be published successively in the near future to adapt to the situation and the needs of the people of the country. The entire Party and the broad masses of cadres must respond to Comrade Mao Zedong's call, intensify their study of Stalin's theories, conscientiously draw ideological strength from Stalin's works, do a good job in our construction work, and strive to realize the industrialization of the country and the gradual transition to socialism.

    斯大林著作在中国的传播
    谷力虹
    “斯大林全集”中文版第一卷出版了。斯大林全集的出版和马克思、恩格斯、列宁著作的大量印行是我国人民的最大的幸福。在过去三十多年以来，我国人民在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林学说的指导下赢得了革命的伟大胜利。今后我们将继续依靠它向着社会主义和共产主义前进。
    斯大林在列宁逝世以后，领导苏联人民建设社会主义和战胜法西斯，指导全世界人民的解放运动，全面地发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义推进到新的高峰。斯大林在中国革命问题上也献出了崇高的智慧。中国共产党不断地学习斯大林的著作，如同他们不断地学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁的著作一样。正是因为坚持了这个学习，中国共产党才茁壮地成长和发展起来。
    斯大林著作在中国的传播始于三十年前。
    最早被介绍到中国来的斯大林的著作，便是他的杰出的理论著作“论列宁主义基础”。这本书的介绍者是著名共产党人瞿秋白同志和蒋光慈（蒋光赤）同志。我们可以在一九二四年十二月二十日出版的“新青年”季刊第四期上看到蒋光赤译的“列宁主义之民族问题的原理”（即“论列宁主义基础”第六章“民族问题”），在一九二五年四月二十二日出版的“新青年”第一号上看到瞿秋白摘要译述的“列宁主义概论”一文。此外，在一九二五年十二月二十九日出版的“中国青年”第一○六期上，也开始以“列宁主义的理论及实践”为题，分期译载了“论列宁主义基础”的第一章至第四章。由于这一著作的单行本已于一九二六年初在广州出版，该刊乃停止续载。
    自中国共产党成立至第二次国内革命战争这一期间，斯大林的著作便这样开始通过革命的进步的刊物、中国共产党的党内刊物和各种铅印的油印的小册子，公开地或秘密地逐渐广泛地被传播着，指导和鼓舞了中国人民革命运动的发展。
    由于长期的战争和白色恐怖，这些刊物和小册子只有极少数被有心人留存下来。这些书现在已成为中国革命历史文物的一部分和中国人民出版事业的珍贵的纪念品。
    从这些纪念品中，我们可以看到，在第一次、第二次国内革命战争时期，“论列宁主义基础”的单行本，以及后来这一著作和“论列宁主义底几个问题”合编在一起的单行本，先后在许多地方以各种不同的版本传播着，成为中国共产党人和中国革命人民学习马克思列宁主义的教科书。在不少场合，这一著作被郑重地出版，例如“新青年社”出版的“列宁主义概论”（即“论列宁主义基础”）的一九二八年的再版本（初版于一九二七年）的扉页上，就印着“贡献这个译本给中国共产党第五次大会”。这书还曾在一九三一年十一月被中国工农红军第十二军政治部重印，在红色根据地普遍发行，用来纪念第一次全国工农代表大会的开幕。上述两个著作的合编本，曾于一九三○年在上海出版，当时用了“列宁”（世界科学研究会丛书）这一书名。一九三三年二月，工农红军学校政治部用“列宁主义概论”这一书名重印了这个合编本。这本书用福建土纸印了一万册。
    在苏联共产党获得恢复国民经济的决定意义的胜利之后，把苏维埃国家引上新的历史阶段的斯大林的重要著作——“在联共（布）第十四次代表大会上关于中央委员会政治工作的总结报告”（一九二五年十二月十八日），在当时曾立即被介绍到中国来。一九二六年一月三十一日、二月一日中华全国总工会省港罢工委员会在广州出版的“工人之路”日刊第二一八、二一九期上，和一九二六年七月二十五日出版的“新青年”第五期上，就都刊载有这一报告的摘要，前者标题为“苏联经济状况与其应行政策”，后者标题为“苏联政治经济概况”。斯大林在联共（布）第十五次、十六次、十七次代表大会上的报告也在发表后就迅速被翻译出来。其中“在联共（布）第十七次代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告”在当年（一九三四年）便由上海中国书店出版了。
    斯大林关于民族和殖民地问题的著作，是殖民地半殖民地人民革命运动的重要指导文献。现在我们可以看到一九三三年三月十五日上海扬子江书店出版的“马克思主义和民族问题”的译本。斯大林“论南斯拉夫的民族问题”、“再论民族问题”两文，也在一九三三年译出。在此以前，还有一种辑译马克思、列宁、斯大林等人著作的“马克思主义的民族革命论”，出版者是“新青年社”，时在一九二七年。
    在上述时期中，斯大林的其他重要著作，也不断地被介绍到中国来。我们可以举出如下几个例子。
    一九二九年九月十日出版的“列宁青年”第一卷第二十三期，译载了“中国革命问题中反对派的错误”（即“时事问题简评”第二部分“关于中国”）。同年十月出版的该刊第二卷第一、二期上，又连载了“苏联工业化与反右倾斗争问题”（即“论国家工业化与联共（布）党内的右倾”）一文。
    一九三○年三月十五日出版的“布尔塞维克”第三卷第二、三期（合刊），译载了“大变化的一年”（即“大转变的一年”）。
    一九三○年二月出版的“共产国际”月刊第一卷第一期，译载了“斯大林同志在马克思主义农业学家会议上的演说词”（即“论苏联土地政策底几个问题”）。
    一九三二年三月十八日出版的“红旗周报”第三十二期，译载了“论布尔塞维主义史中的几个问题”（即“论布尔什维主义历史中的几个问题”）。
    一九三三年十二月十日出版的“青年实话”周报第三卷第三号，译载了“青年团的任务”（即“论共产主义青年团的任务”）一文。
    上述书、刊，大都是在严重的战争环境和白色恐怖的环境中出版和发行的。广大革命人民热爱斯大林的著作，他们用各种办法来翻印它。一九三四年十月十五日瑞金中共闽浙赣省委印行的“斯大林论列宁”这一小册子，就是用土纸单面油印的，书末附有斯大林传略。
    一九二六年，在苏联出版了斯大林的文集“列宁主义问题”。本书在此后十多年中成为斯大林著作中传播最广的书。一九三四年一月，正当第五次反围攻战争紧张进行的时候，瑞金中共中央局出版了“列宁主义问题”（包括斯大林著作十二篇）。这本书是作为庆祝当时召开的全国工农代表大会的献礼出版的。
    如所周知，苏联出版的列宁、斯大林著作的中文本，对于中国人民学习马克思列宁主义发挥了巨大的作用。还在我国第一次、第二次国内革命战争时期，苏联外国工人出版社便大量出版了斯大林著作的中文本，其中包括各种单行本和两卷“列宁主义问题”（一九三五年出版）。这些书在当时反革命的隔离的情况下，仍然不断地被输送到中国来，给予中国革命人民以极大的支持力量。
    在整个第一次、第二次国内革命战争时期，党克服种种困难，陆续地在广大革命干部和人民中传播了斯大林的著作。
    抗日战争爆发以后，中国革命进入新的高潮。在抗日战争时期和第三次国内革命战争时期——中国人民革命运动蓬勃发展直到取得全国胜利的年代里，斯大林的著作更多地和更有系统地被介绍到中国来了。中国共产党人在毛泽东同志号召下，展开了学习马克思列宁主义的运动。关于这一点，陈伯达同志在“斯大林和中国革命”的论文中曾经说到：“毛泽东同志有机会宽泛地阅读斯大林的著作，是在抗日战争的时候。毛泽东同志用最高的热情，来阅读和深思熟虑他所得到的斯大林的各种著作。”“斯大林的学说，斯大林的方法和理论，经过毛泽东同志的介绍和运用，极大地启发了中国共产党人在政治上、思想上的广阔眼界，提高了中国共产党人的马克思列宁主义自觉，帮助我们党有足够的思想力量，可以打败任何反革命和任何阻碍革命前进的敌人。”
    抗日战争初期，无论在抗日根据地或国民党统治区，斯大林的杰出的理论著作“论列宁主义基础”和他的辉煌的文集“列宁主义问题”以及“马克思主义与民族问题”等著作，都有了比较完善的译本。一九三八年五月，上海播种社还出版了斯大林的另一文集“论反对派”。
    一九四○年，“苏联共产党（布）历史简要读本”中文本在延安由解放社出版（同年在上海以“中国出版社”的名义出版）。斯大林这一伟大著作的出版（一九三八年），是全世界共产党思想和政治生活上的重大事件。毛泽东同志在一九四一年发表的“改造我们的学习”的报告中指出：“‘苏联共产党（布）历史简要读本’是一百年来全世界共产主义运动的最高的综合和总结，是理论和实际结合的典型，在全世界还只有这一个完全的典型。我们看列宁、斯大林他们是如何把马克思主义的普遍真理和苏联革命的具体实践互相结合又从而发展马克思主义的，就可以知道我们在中国是应该如何地工作了。”毛泽东同志指示全党研究马克思列宁主义应以这一伟大著作为中心材料。中国共产党人响应毛泽东同志的号召，热情地学习了“联共（布）党史”。
    一九四二年，中国共产党人以整风运动的形式在全党进行了马克思列宁主义的教育。斯大林论党的布尔什维克化、“联共（布）党史”结束语、斯大林论领导与检查、斯大林论自我批评、列宁、斯大林等论党的纪律与党的民主、斯大林论平均主义等论文都被列为整风文献。全党干部都精读斯大林的这些著作和教言，并对自己的思想作风进行了检查。在整风运动及此后长时期中，这些文件都一再编辑出版，成为中国共产党人改进工作作风的重要指针和座右铭。党的各级宣传部和各地党的报纸，从那时起还经常地为解决当时工作中的重大问题而辑录列宁、斯大林著作中的有关部分，作为理论指导。
    斯大林关于中国革命问题的著作，他的关于中国革命的英明预见，关于中国革命性质问题、关于中国革命策略问题的重要指示，是对于中国革命的重大贡献。这些著作在一九四二年整风运动以后，也在党内有系统地编辑出来了。一九四四年七月在延安，中共中央书记处编印了“列宁、斯大林、共产国际论中国”，其中包括斯大林的著作二十三篇，以后，解放社又出版了“列宁斯大林论中国”，使全党全国人民得以有系统地学习列宁、斯大林关于中国革命的学说。
    在抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争时期，虽然党处在严重的战争环境中，但斯大林新发表的著作，从一九三九年的“在第十八次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告”，到苏联卫国战争时期以及战后的言论，都能随时翻译出版。党很快地掌握了广播（新华社的成立）和报纸（各解放区报纸的大量出版）这两个有力的武器。斯大林在苏联伟大卫国战争时期的每一演说、每一文告，都迅速地通过广播和报纸以及印成小册子在全党传播，成为全党全军在抗日战争时期的极重要的鼓舞力量。一九四五年，上海时代社便出版了斯大林“论苏联伟大卫国战争”这一文集。
    在战争的年代里，党始终以极大的努力翻译出版马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作。从延安到各个解放区到国民党统治区，各种经典著作都不断地被翻印着。“斯大林选集”的出版，便是这种努力的显著标志之一。一九三九年一月，延安在物质条件困难的条件下，出版了五卷“斯大林选集”，辑集了斯大林重要著作五十九篇。全书共一千七百六十八页。这部“斯大林选集”在一九四○年又在上海以“中国出版社”的名义出版。一九四一年，在战斗的太行地区，新华日报华北分馆也翻印了三千册。这三千本书是在物质条件极端困难的情况下印出的，全书用粉红色、绿色、黄色、白色等各色油光纸单面印刷，摺成双页装订起来。一九四九年九月，东北新华书店再次翻印了这部选集，分普及本及精装本两种，流传全国各地。这个精装本已是用道林纸来印刷的了。
    全国解放，中华人民共和国成立，为大量出版马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林著作创造了条件。中国人民已有可能在全国范围内在全体规模上进行马克思列宁主义的学习了。
    还在一九四九年初，毛泽东同志便号召全党加强理论学习，并规定了十二本干部必读书。其中“论列宁主义基础”、“苏联共产党（布）历史简要读本”、“列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设”（上下两册）、“列宁斯大林论中国”四书，包括了斯大林的许多重要著作。当战争还在进行的时候，党的许多干部便热情地响应毛泽东同志的号召，开始逐一阅读这些著作了。这十二本干部必读书，从一九四九年开始以统一的版本陆续出版后，一直大量地发行着，成为干部自修马克思列宁主义的基本读物。
    斯大林在一九五○年六月发表的天才著作“马克思主义与语言学问题”，是对于马克思列宁主义宝库的杰出的贡献。这一著作的译文发表后，对于中国的学术工作，发生了巨大的影响。它给予中国共产党人和中国人民以新的有力的思想武器。
    一九五二年十月，斯大林新的伟大的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”发表。在这个著作中，斯大林全面地论述了社会主义政治经济学的根本问题，指明了社会主义过渡到共产主义的道路，总结了苏联社会主义建设和国际革命运动的经验，创造性地丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义。这一著作的中文本出版后，十一月一个月内即发行九十六万册以上。中共中央在号召全党学习“苏联社会主义经济问题”的指示中，指出这一著作不仅对于马克思主义是一重要发展，并且对于我国的经济建设有巨大的指导意义，要求党的高级干部首先认真学习这一著作，以便指导一般干部的学习。在过去的半年多中，全国广大干部响应中共中央的号召，形成了学习斯大林著作和联共（布）第十九次代表大会文件的热潮，并为此后的干部理论学习打下了良好的基础。
    最近，全国各级干部正按照中共中央关于一九五三——一九五四年干部理论教育的指示，展开以
    “苏联共产党（布）历史简要读本”第九——十二章为中心的苏联社会主义经济建设问题的学习。
    和不断高涨的学习运动相适应，斯大林的著作近年来大量出版了。自一九四九年至一九五三年六月，人民出版社印行斯大林著作共计四十一种（包括合著七种），印数共达六百六十万零四千册。其中一九四九年印行六十万八千册，一九五○年印行一百零四万九千册，一九五一年印行十三万五千册，一九五二年印行一百八十四万二千册，一九五三年上半年即印行二百九十七万册。
    在上述四十一种著作中：
    “论列宁主义基础”印了二十八次，共三十七万四千册，
    “苏联共产党（布）历史简要读本”印了二十八次，共三十三万册，
    “苏联社会主义经济问题”印了十七次，共一百三十三万五千册，
    “在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说”印了十三次，共七十七万一千册，
    “列宁斯大林论中国”印了二十次，共二十一万八千册，
    “列宁斯大林论社会主义经济建设”上册印了二十四次，共二十一万八千册，下册印了二十三次，共十八万五千册，
    “论苏联社会主义经济建设”高级组本和中级组本第一册至今年六月底止，共印了七十一万六千册。
    自一九四九年以来，国际书店还向苏联外国文书籍出版局订购了大量的斯大林著作中文本，总数达三百五十一万九千多册。其中一九四九年进货数为四十六万四千二百多册，一九五○年进货数为一百八十万零六千六百多册，一九五一年进货数为三十六万四千一百多册，一九五二年进货数为十九万五千六百多册，一九五三年一月至八月进货数为六十九万多册。在这三百五十一万九千多册中，“联共（布）党史简明教程”占六十二万八千多册。
    这样，自一九四九年至一九五三年上半年，斯大林的各种著作的中文本在中国的发行数已超过一千万册。
    从这些数字中，我们同样地可以看出全国解放以来，中国人民如何热爱斯大林的著作，和以愈益高涨的热忱来学习斯大林的学说。
    毛泽东同志在追悼斯大林逝世时所写的“最伟大的友谊”一文中说：
    “斯大林同志的一切著作都是马克思主义的不朽的文献。他所著的‘列宁主义基础’、‘苏联共产党历史’以及他最后的伟大著作‘苏联社会主义经济问题’，是马克思列宁主义的百科全书，是百年来世界共产主义运动经验的综合。他在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说，是给世界各国共产党人的一篇宝贵的遗嘱。我们中国共产党人和世界各国共产党人一样，是从斯大林同志的伟大的著作中去找寻自己胜利的途径的。”
    他又说：
    “从列宁逝世以来，斯大林同志一直是世界共产主义运动的中心人物。我们围绕着他，不断地向他请教，不断地从他的著作中吸取思想的力量。”
    中国人民三十多年来，正是这样在中国共产党的领导下，不断地从斯大林的著作中吸取思想力量，遵循着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大学说，而取得了历史性的胜利的。斯大林著作三十年来在中国的传播状况，也正说明了这一点。
    现在，我们的国家已进入建设时期。列宁、斯大林指导苏联社会主义建设的学说，对于我们有重大的指导意义。在这个时候，“斯大林全集”中文本开始出版了，这是多么值得庆幸的事！“斯大林全集”中文本各卷将适应形势和全国人民的要求，在今后较短时间内陆续出版。全党和全国广大干部，必须响应毛泽东同志的号召，加紧学习斯大林的学说，认真地从斯大林著作中吸取思想力量，做好我们的建设工作，为实现国家工业化和逐渐地过渡到社会主义而奋斗。
