    This Year's Strike Movement in the Capitalist World is Large in Scale
    Seriously Hits Imperialist Arms Expansion and War Preparation Plans
    [Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch] Since the beginning of this year, the strike movement of workers in capitalist countries has further surged. A characteristic of the strike struggles launched by workers in various countries bearing the heavy burden of imperialist arms expansion and war preparations this year is the enormous scale of the movements. Workers in various sectors have been widely involved in this movement, and the strikes have been continuous and wave after wave. At the same time, the economic struggles of workers to defend their immediate economic interests have developed more than in the past into political struggles for peace and democracy, and many strike movements have become demonstrations against war and fascist policies. The strike movements of workers in various countries have seriously undermined the imperialists' plans for arms expansion and war preparations and the monopoly capitalists' conspiracy to attack the living standards and democratic rights of workers.
    In some major capitalist countries, the strike movement has developed to an unprecedented scale in recent years. There have been increasing numbers of strikes that are directly aimed at the reactionary policies and measures of these countries' governments.
    This phenomenon is most pronounced in Italy and France. The strike movements of workers in these two countries have had a significant impact on their domestic political life and have achieved certain victories on many occasions.
    Italian industrial workers have continuously held strikes this year to protest against factory owners' mass layoffs of workers. Those participating in the protest strikes included 160,000 metallurgical workers in Milan Province, more than 100,000 metallurgical and machine-building workers in Genoa, 60,000 industrial workers in Rome and Rome Province, as well as 200,000 chemical workers and 600,000 textile workers. Two million agricultural workers in Italy also held a strike in April this year, which forced landlords in some areas to agree to immediately pay unemployment relief and wage subsidies to workers. In March this year, millions of workers across the country held a general strike to protest against the anti-democratic election reform law manufactured by the Italian ruling clique. In major industrial centers, the number of workers participating in the strike accounted for 90% to 100% of the total number of workers. On a larger scale, eight million workers in various industries held a 24-hour national general strike on September 24, demanding wage increases and protesting against layoffs. This general strike was the largest strike in Italy after the war. Almost 100% of workers and staff participated in this general strike. During the strike, no one went to work in factories of all sizes in many cities, no cars could be seen on the streets of many cities, and no newspapers were published in any city.
    In France, since the beginning of this year, strikes by workers in all walks of life demanding wage increases have also been continuous. In August, French workers held the largest national general strike since 1936 to oppose the Laniel government's "emergency decree" and demand wage increases. The strike lasted nearly three weeks. At the height of the strike, 5 million workers participated. Many civil servants, shop clerks, and technicians in the railway system who had not participated in strikes for a long time also participated. Staff of national and state-owned public utilities also widely participated in this strike. The strike paralyzed the postal and telecommunications, railway, and important departments of national industry. According to official newspapers, the strike caused the government and factory owners to suffer losses of 50 billion francs, forcing the government to amend the "emergency decree" and enabling workers in many sectors to win wage increases. This year, the French government's persecution of democratic organizations and the arrest of patriots, as well as the French police's shooting of demonstrators in July, have sparked a series of protest strikes by workers throughout France. The workers' staunch struggle enabled many patriots, including CGT Secretary-General Le Leap, to finally walk out of national prisons.
    Japanese workers under the dual exploitation of US-Japan monopoly capital, regardless of the suppression by the US-Japan reactionaries, also launched large-scale strike movements this year. This spring, 80,000 transportation workers, 100,000 steel workers, and workers in industries such as vehicles, shipbuilding, and machinery went on strike one after another, forming a wave of strikes demanding wage increases. This year, the struggle for living rights and legitimate rights and interests has spread to almost all industrial sectors across Japan, and many trade unions that had almost never participated in strikes in the past have now participated in the unified strikes of their respective industries. The strike also extended to factories managed by the US military in Japan. For example, workers at the Akabane Factory of Nippon Steel Works in Tokyo bravely conducted a strike in June to demand wage increases and defend trade union rights. Even Japanese workers working on US military bases, in order to defend trade union rights and legitimate rights and interests, regardless of the brutal suppression by the US military, held two large-scale strikes. To protest against the Yoshida government's "Anti-Strike Law," three million workers held various political struggles, including strikes, this year.
    In the bastion of monopoly capital—the United States—although the ruling clique is using fascist means such as anti-labor laws, batons, and prisons to brutally persecute the workers' movement, the American workers' strike movement continues to rise this year. Last year, the United States had the most strikes since 1946, with 3.5 million workers participating in the strikes. And this year, in the first half of the year alone, more than two million workers have participated in strike struggles. Workers in steel, rubber, electrical, docks, automobiles, railways and other sectors held strikes. At the same time, many strikes also occurred in enterprises producing war materials, directly hitting the war preparations plans of the American warmongers.
    In colonial and dependent countries, strike movements are also being widely carried out. Workers are waging struggles for food and clothing, and are increasingly closely combining this struggle with the struggle for national independence. For example, workers in Tunisia, Africa, held a general strike in May this year to protest against the French colonial authorities' terrorist measures and fight for national independence. Workers in many Latin American countries have launched a struggle to nationalize resources.
    The upsurge of the strike movement in capitalist countries vividly demonstrates the growth of the world labor movement. The results of the Third World Federation of Trade Unions Congress, scheduled to open in Vienna on October 10, will undoubtedly further strengthen and develop the struggles of workers in various countries.

### 今年资本主义世界罢工运动规模很大  严重打击了帝国主义的扩军备战计划

    今年资本主义世界罢工运动规模很大
    严重打击了帝国主义的扩军备战计划
    【新华社十日讯】今年以来，资本主义国家工人的罢工运动进一步高涨。背负着帝国主义扩军备战重担的各国工人在今年所展开的罢工斗争的一个特色是，运动规模巨大。各部门的工人很广泛地卷入了这个运动，而且罢工一直是此伏彼起，连绵不绝。同时，工人保卫切身经济权益的经济斗争比过去更多地发展成为争取和平民主的政治斗争，许多罢工运动成为反对战争及法西斯政策的示威。各国工人的罢工运动严重地打击了帝国主义扩军备战的计划和垄断资本向工人生活水平及民主权利进攻的阴谋。
    在一些主要的资本主义国家中，罢工运动在今年发展到多年来空前的规模。把矛头直接针对着这些国家政府的反动政策和措施而举行的罢工，已越来越多了。
    这种现象在意大利和法国最为显著。两国工人的罢工运动已在他们国内政治生活中产生了重大影响，并在许多场合中取得了一定的胜利。
    意大利产业工人在今年连续不断地举行了抗议厂主大批解雇工人的罢工。参加抗议罢工的有米兰省十六万冶金工人、热那亚十万多冶金和机器制造工人、罗马市和罗马省六万产业工人以及二十万化学工人和六十万纺织工人等。意大利二百万农业工人在今年四月也举行了罢工，结果迫使若干地区的地主答应立即把失业救济金和工资补助金补发给工人。今年三月，全国数百万工人曾举行总罢工，抗议意大利统治集团制造出来的反民主的选举改革法。在各大工业中心，参加罢工的工人占工人总数的百分之九十到百分之百。规模更大的是，八百万各业工人在九月二十四日举行的要求增加工资、抗议解雇工人的全国二十四小时总罢工。这次总罢工是意大利战后规模最大的一次罢工。几乎百分之百的工人和职员参加了这次总罢工。在罢工期间，许多城市各大小工厂没有一个人去上工，许多城市的街上看不到一辆汽车，没有一个城市出版报纸。
    在法国，今年以来各行各业工人要求增加工资的罢工，也一直连绵不绝。八月间，法国工人为了反对拉尼埃政府的“紧急措施法令”、要求增加工资，举行了一次自一九三六年以来最大的全国总罢工。罢工历时近三个星期。在罢工高潮时，参加罢工的工人达五百万人。许多长久未参加过罢工的公务员、商店店员、铁路系统中的技术人员都参加了罢工。国家和国营公用事业的工作人员也广泛参加了这次罢工。罢工瘫痪了邮电、铁路和国家工业中的重要部门。据官方报纸估计，这次罢工使政府和厂主受到五百亿法郎的损失，迫使政府修改了“紧急措施法令”，并使许多部门的工人赢得了工资的增加。在今年里，法国政府迫害民主组织、逮捕爱国者的事件，法国警察七月间枪杀示威群众的事件，都激起法国各地工人一连串的抗议罢工。工人的坚强斗争使得包括法国总工会总书记勒里普在内的许多爱国者终于走出了国家监狱。
    在美日垄断资本双重剥削下的日本工人，在今年也不顾美日反动派的镇压，展开了大规模的罢工运动。今年春季，八万运输工人、十万钢铁工人以及车辆、造船、机器等产业工人相继罢工，形成了要求提高工资的罢工浪潮。在今年里，争取生活权利和合法权益的斗争几乎遍及日本全国一切产业部门，许多工会过去几乎没有参加过罢工，现在都参加了各该业的统一罢工。罢工也扩展到驻日美军管理的工厂，例如东京日本制钢所赤羽工厂的工人在六月间就英勇地进行了要求增加工资和保卫工会权利的罢工。甚至在美国军事基地上工作的日本工人为了保卫工会权利和合法权益，也不顾美军的残酷镇压，举行了两次大规模罢工。为了抗议吉田政府的“禁止罢工法”，三百万工人在今年举行了包括罢工在内的各项政治性斗争。
    在垄断资本的堡垒——美国，尽管统治集团用反劳工法、警棍、监狱等法西斯手段蛮横迫害着工人运动，但是美国工人罢工运动在今年仍在继续高涨。去年美国罢工曾经是一九四六年以来最多的一年，参加罢工的工人有三百五十万。而今年仅仅上半年中就已有二百万以上工人参加了罢工斗争。钢铁、橡胶、电气、码头、汽车、铁路等部门工人举行了罢工。同时，许多罢工还发生在生产战争物资的企业中，直接打击了美国战争贩子的备战计划。
    在殖民地附属国中，罢工运动也在广泛开展。工人进行着争取温饱的斗争，并且越来越把这个斗争和争取民族独立的斗争紧密结合起来。例如，非洲的突尼斯工人在今年五月举行了抗议法国殖民当局恐怖措施、争取民族独立的总罢工。拉丁美洲许多国家工人展开了争取资源国有化的斗争。
    资本主义各国罢工运动的高涨，集中地表现出世界工人运动的壮大。定于十月十日在维也纳开幕的世界工会第三次代表大会的结果，无疑将使各国工人的斗争进一步加强和开展。
