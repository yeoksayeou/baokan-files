Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 30th -- A special correspondent for this agency reports: The U.S. side, in violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement's provisions regarding the "Terms of Reference" of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, is brazenly interfering with the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. It lodged an extremely unreasonable protest against the informational letter issued to prisoners of war by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and arbitrarily instructed special agents to detain this letter and "burn it in bundles." This action by the U.S. side is clearly a serious insult and blatant interference with the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, with the aim of causing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to lose its neutral and independent character.

On September 26, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission distributed and broadcast a letter to all prisoners of war under its custody. This letter was drafted by a subcommittee composed of representatives from the five neutral nations of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and approved by the plenary session of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The U.S. side had already obtained a copy of this letter. The letter told the prisoners of war that the mission of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission "is to guarantee all the rights you should have under the terms of the Armistice Agreement and other international agreements. We are here to ensure that you can freely exercise your right to be repatriated." "No one has the right to prevent you from going home, nor can anyone force you to go home." "Our task is to prevent anyone from using any form of pressure on you."

The letter told the prisoners of war that they could state their demands to the Indian troops or any representative of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The letter said: "If anyone forces you to do something against your will, do not be fooled. We will, in accordance with regulations, punish anyone who tries to prevent you from going home or force you to go home."

The letter also warned: "If you behave improperly, engage in disruptive activities, or refuse to obey orders, you will be punished by the custodial army."

The letter also told the prisoners of war that during the ninety-day period of explanatory work, "representatives of your respective countries will come to explain to you in detail your rights and privileges. And they will tell you everything about going home. They will especially tell you that you have the right to peace, and that you have complete freedom to decide whether or not to return home. This explanatory work is stipulated in the Armistice Agreement. You must all attend." The letter said: "Do not be afraid. You are free to make your decisions. Those who wish to be repatriated will not be questioned and will be immediately repatriated home. Many of you have already been released from our custody and repatriated after expressing your willingness to return home."

The letter said: At the end of the ninety-day period, those who have not exercised their right to repatriation will remain in the prisoner of war camp under the supervision of the Indian custodial forces for another thirty days, awaiting the decision of the political conference. "If the political conference cannot make any decision, then you will be restored to civilian status. You are free to go to a neutral country. If you wish to return to your homeland, you can still go."

The letter finally told the prisoners of war: "This is the Neutral Nations personnel speaking to you. We are completely independent. We are not influenced by either side. We are here to rescue you and protect you from coercion in any way. Please trust us wholeheartedly. We assure you that we can give you all the above rights."

It can be clearly seen from the content of this letter that it is fully in line with all the provisions and spirit of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." Even Hamblen of the U.S. side had to admit in his letter that the Commission's letter "complies with the 'Terms of Reference'." Therefore, it is completely within the scope of its duties for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to distribute and broadcast this letter. Because the U.S. side used Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee gang special agents to implement a reign of terror against the prisoners of war, not allowing them to express their desire for repatriation, and plotting to sabotage and disrupt the explanatory work, it is absolutely necessary for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to broadcast and distribute such a letter to the prisoners of war, so that they know that they have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated according to the "Terms of Reference," and at the same time, the Commission reiterates in accordance with Article 3 of the "Terms of Reference" that it is not permitted to use force or threats to obstruct or force prisoners of war to be repatriated, and to inflict violence or insults on the person of prisoners of war. Any special agent who violates this clause to carry out a reign of terror against prisoners of war should of course be punished.

However, this letter greatly alarmed the U.S. side, which was doing its best to force the detention of prisoners of war. They feared that after reading this letter, the prisoners of war would be brave enough to break through the control of the special agents and demand repatriation. Therefore, on the one hand, they instructed the special agents who had infiltrated the prisoner of war camp to quickly detain the letter distributed to the prisoners of war, burn it in bundles, and prevent the prisoners of war from reading it. On the other hand, Hamblen, the head of the U.S. Repatriation Group, came forward to write a letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, making absurd so-called "angry accusations."

Hamblen roared and accused the letter of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission of "emphasizing the desire for repatriation." What U.S. law does this violate? Article 1, Paragraph 1, Sentence 1 of the "Terms of Reference" stipulates that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was established "to ensure that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated after the armistice." The letter of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is precisely based on this clause and other clauses of the "Terms of Reference." It not only guarantees that prisoners of war can "freely exercise the right to be repatriated," but also declares that no one can prevent or force prisoners of war to be repatriated. If the U.S. side was not trying to threaten and suppress the neutral countries, so that they would allow U.S. special agents to implement a reign of terror against prisoners of war without any scruples in order to force the detention of prisoners of war, they would never need to get so angry. In fact, the same letter from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has also been broadcast and distributed to the prisoners of war handed over to the custody of Indian troops by our side, but our side believes that this is a fair action by the neutral countries in accordance with the "Terms of Reference" and has no reason to oppose it.

The absurdity of Hamblen is especially evident in his accusation that the letter of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission "improperly influences the prisoners of war of both sides to make them willing to be repatriated rather than allowing them to choose freely and independently." This shows that the U.S. side is afraid that prisoners of war will be willing to be repatriated, just like a robber is afraid of a judge. What they are demanding is to allow the special agents to have the freedom to use various violent and terrifying methods among the prisoners of war to deprive them of the right to choose, and not to enable the prisoners of war to "choose freely and independently." What is so "improper" about making prisoners of war willing to be repatriated? If it is "improper" to allow prisoners of war to return home to live a peaceful life, is it "proper" to beat, abuse, disembowel, and gouge out the hearts of prisoners of war in order to detain them and make them cannon fodder for the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee gangs, and victims of the U.S.'s "Cold War"? Obviously, it is not that there is anything "improper" about the letter of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, but that the U.S. side has committed the evil act of forcibly detaining prisoners of war with threats of force in their prisoner of war camps. It is precisely in order to insist on this evil act that Hamblen opposes all appropriate measures to eliminate the doubts and fears of prisoners of war and make them willing to be repatriated. Hamblen's so-called "free and independent choice" for prisoners of war is actually to let Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee gang special agents "choose" on behalf of the prisoners of war. This trick has long been thoroughly exposed by many Korean and Chinese captured personnel who have returned after breaking through the control of special agents.

Hamblen's letter was so absurd that it was immediately refuted by all the members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. A Swedish representative also pointed out that the master copy for printing the Chinese version of this letter was actually typed on a Chinese typewriter by a U.S. military stenographer in the U.S. base camp. So the U.S. side had known about this letter for a long time. This makes Hamblen's accusations even more absurd. It can be clearly seen from this that all these unreasonable behaviors of the U.S. side fully prove that the U.S. side has brazenly done something wrong, refuses to correct it, and instead simply tries to cover it up and implement it even more brazenly and unreasonably, and even tries to force neutral countries to serve their conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war. In order to fairly perform its duties in accordance with the "Terms of Reference" and to safeguard the neutrality and independence of the Commission, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has no other way but to resist this tyrannical position of the U.S. side.

### 中立国遣返委员会根据“职权范围”规定  向不直接遣返的战俘散发并广播公告信

    中立国遣返委员会根据“职权范围”规定
    向不直接遣返的战俘散发并广播公告信
    美方竟对委员会这一合理行动加以蛮横干涉
    【新华社开城三十日电】本社特派记者报道：美方破坏朝鲜停战协定中关于“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的协议，竟然对中立国遣返委员会的工作横加干涉，对中立国遣返委员会向战俘发表的该委员会的公告信提出极端蛮横无理的抗议，擅自指使特务将这封公告信加以扣留，并将其“整捆焚烧”。美方这种行动显然是对于中立国遣返委员会的严重侮辱和横暴干涉，其目的是企图使中立国遣返委员会丧失其中立的、独立的性质。
    九月二十六日，中立国遣返委员会向其看管下的全体战俘散发了并且广播了一封信。这封信是由中立国遣返委员会的五个中立国的代表所组成的一个小组委员会拟就，并由中立国遣返委员会全体会议通过的，美方是早已就得到了这一封信的底稿的。这封信告诉战俘们说，中立国遣返委员会的任务“就是为你们保证停战协定条款和其他国际协定所规定的你们应有的一切权利。我们到这里来就是为了保证你们可以自由地运用你们被遣返的权利”。“任何人都无权阻止你们回家，也不容任何人强迫你们回家。”“我们的任务就是要防止任何人对你们使用任何形式的压力。”
    这封信告诉战俘们，他们可以向印度军队或中立国遣返委员会的任何一个代表陈述他们的要求。信上说：“如果有任何人强迫你做违反你的意志的事情，你不要上当。我们将会按照规定，处罚那些企图阻止你回家或是强迫你回家的任何人。”
    这封信又警告说：“如果你行为不轨、进行扰乱活动或是拒绝服从命令，你就将受到看管军队的处罚。”
    这封信还告诉战俘们说：在进行解释工作的九十天期间，“你们所属国家的代表将来详细地向你们解释你们的权利和特权。而且他们将告诉你们有关你们回家的一切事情。他们特别要告诉你们，你们有和平的权利，你们对于回家与否的决定有完全的自由。这种解释工作是停战协定上所规定的。你们必须全体去参加。”这封信说：“不要害怕。你们可以自由地做出你们的决定。那些愿意被遣返的人们将不予询问，立刻予以遣返回家。你们当中有许多人在表示愿意回家以后，就立刻从我们的看管下释放出来，现在已经被遣返了。”
    这封信说：在九十天期满时，凡是还没有行使其遣返权利的人，还要在印度看管部队的监管下留在战俘营中再等三十天，等待政治会议的决定。“假如政治会议不能作出任何决定，那么，你们将恢复平民的身份。你们可以自由地到一个中立国去。如果你们愿意回到你们的祖国，你们还是可以去的。”
    这封信最后告诉战俘们说：“这是中立国的人员在对你们讲话。我们是完全独立的。我们不受任何一方的影响。我们到这里来就是为了救你们，保护你们不受任何方式的胁迫。请你们全心信任我们。我们向你们保证：我们可以给予你们上述一切权利。”
    从这封信的内容可以清楚地看出，它是完全符合于“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的全部条文和精神的。甚至连美方汉布伦在他的信中都不得不承认委员会的信“符合于‘职权范围’”。因此，中立国遣返委员会散发和广播这封信，完全是它的职权范围之内所应做的事情。由于美方利用国民党和李承晚匪帮特务分子对战俘实行恐怖统治，不许战俘表达他们要求遣返的愿望，并且阴谋对解释工作进行破坏和捣乱，中立国遣返委员会向战俘广播和散发这样一封信，使战俘们知道他们根据“职权范围”有机会行使其被遣返的权利，同时该委员会并根据“职权范围”第三款重申不许使用武力威胁阻挠或强使战俘遣返并对战俘人身施以暴力或侮辱他们，更是绝对必要的。任何违反这一款来对战俘实行恐怖统治的特务，当然是应该受到处分的。
    但是这封信却使竭力企图强迫扣留战俘的美方大为恐慌，他们唯恐战俘们在读了这封信以后会勇敢起来突破特务的控制要求遣返。因此他们一方面指使混入战俘营的特务赶紧将散发给战俘的这封信加以扣留，整捆地烧掉，不许战俘们阅读，一方面由美方遣返组组长汉布伦出面写信给中立国遣返委员会，提出荒谬绝伦的所谓“愤怒的指责”。
    汉布伦咆哮地指责中立国遣返委员会的信是“着重于遣返的愿望”。这又犯了什么美国的法律？“职权范围”第一条第一款第一句就规定了成立中立国遣返委员会就是“为保证全部战俘在停战之后有机会行使其被遣返的权利”。中立国遣返委员会的信正是根据这一条款以及“职权范围”的其他条款。它不仅保证战俘可以“自由地运用被遣返的权利”，并且声明了任何人不能阻止或强迫战俘遣返。如果美方不是企图威胁和压制中立国，使他们容许美方特务毫无顾忌地对战俘实施恐怖统治以便强迫扣留战俘的话，他们是绝不需要动这些肝火的。事实上，同样的中立国遣返委员会的信也已对由我方交给印度部队看管的战俘们广播和散发了，但我方却认为这是中立国根据“职权范围”公正的行动，没有理由加以反对。
    汉布伦的荒谬之处，尤其在于他指责中立国遣返委员会的信“不恰当地影响双方的战俘使他们愿意遣返而不是使他们自由和独立地选择”。这显出美方害怕战俘愿意遣返，就像强盗害怕法官一样。他们所要求的是容许特务们有自由在战俘中用种种暴力和恐怖办法来剥夺战俘作选择的权利，而恰恰不是要使战俘能够“自由和独立地选择”。究竟使战俘愿意遣返，有什么“不恰当”的地方？如果使战俘回家过和平生活是“不恰当”的，难道对战俘毒打、虐杀、剥腹、挖心，这样来扣留他们，使他们成为国民党、李承晚匪帮的炮灰，成为美国进行“冷战”的牺牲品，倒是“恰当”的？显然并不是中立国遣返委员会的信有什么“不恰当”，而是美方在他们的战俘营里做下了“不恰当”的以武力威胁强迫扣留战俘的恶行。正是为了坚持这种恶行，汉布伦才反对使战俘消除疑惧、愿意遣返的一切恰当措施。汉布伦的所谓使战俘“自由和独立地选择”，实际上就是要让国民党和李承晚匪帮特务来代替战俘“选择”。这一套鬼把戏，早已被许多突破特务控制归来的朝中被俘人员彻底揭穿了。
    汉布伦这封信是如此荒谬，以致立即遭到了中立国遣返委员会全体委员的一致驳斥。一位瑞典代表并且指出：印这封信的中文本的底版实际上是由美方的一个军事速记员在美方基地行营里用中文打字机打出来的。所以美方是早就知道有这封信的。这就使汉布伦的指责显得更其荒谬。从这里可以清楚地看出，美方所有这一切无理取闹的行为，完全证明美方自己蛮横地做了亏心事，不肯改正，反而索性更加蛮横、更加无理地企图加以掩盖，加以贯彻，甚至企图逼使中立国家来为他们强迫扣留战俘的阴谋服务。中立国遣返委员会为了公正地按照“职权范围”执行其职务，为了保障委员会的中立性和独立性，除了抵抗美方的这种强暴立场之外，是没有什么别的办法的。
