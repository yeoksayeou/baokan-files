The theoretical study of leading cadres is the primary and regular task of party organizations in government agencies. Article 52 of the "Constitution of the Communist Party of China" stipulates in its fourth item regarding the tasks of a branch: "To educate party members and organize their study." Comrade Suslov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, stated in his speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "Conducting Party education and supervising that communists possess the necessary basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism is the most important task of all party organizations." Communist Party organizations should not only educate their own members but also bear the responsibility of propagating Marxism-Leninism to non-Party masses.

Continuously improving the political and theoretical level of cadres is the fundamental method to ensure the completion of administrative tasks. Comrade Stalin said: "The higher the political level and Marxist-Leninist awareness of the staff in any department of national work and Party work, the higher the work itself, the more effective it is, and the more effective the results of the work are." Therefore, it is self-evident that the party organization of every agency should regard leading cadres' political and theoretical study as its primary and regular task.

Many party organizations in government agencies are indeed doing this now. However, there are also some party organizations that lack a deep understanding of this point and have abandoned or relaxed their leadership over the political and theoretical study of cadres. They either use the excuse of being busy with Party organizational work, believing that they have no time for this, or mistakenly push the responsibility to the agency's study committee, being satisfied with so-called "principle leadership" while actually rarely intervening in the cadres' study issues. More party organizations in government agencies have begun to pay attention to cadres' theoretical education work, but have not truly made leading study their regular center of work. Branch secretaries rarely intervene in study issues, only pushing it to the propaganda committee member to be solely responsible. Branch committees rarely or never discuss leading study issues, and therefore there is no collective leadership over study.

Currently, many party organizations in government agencies have paid attention to establishing study organizations and systems, which is necessary. But after the organization and system are established, we must further pay attention to ideological leadership and guidance on the content of theoretical study in order to achieve real results from theoretical study. At present, comrades managing study in many branches do not pay enough attention to understanding and researching the specific ideological situation of cadres in their studies, and in particular, rarely organize the various study guidance forces within the agency to provide specific guidance and assistance to the activities of theoretical teachers and instructors. In short, the leadership of party organizations in government agencies over cadres' study is still lagging behind the needs of study development. At present, cadres encounter many difficulties in their studies, and they still have many shortcomings in their attitude and methods of learning. If the Party organization does not strengthen its leadership and assistance to their studies, it will not enable them to achieve good learning results, nor will it be able to consolidate their existing learning enthusiasm. Therefore, strengthening the leadership of party branches in government agencies over cadres' theoretical study is a basic link in doing a good job in cadres' theoretical education.

What should we require the Party's grassroots organizations in government agencies—the Party branches—to do in leading cadres' theoretical study? There is a lot of work that needs to be done and can be done in this regard. Generally speaking, there are the following three aspects of work:

(1) Persist in necessary study systems on a voluntary basis and supervise the theoretical study of party members organizationally. On the one hand, we must emphasize that every party member should have the consciousness of studying, and on the other hand, we must emphasize that the Party organization should strictly supervise them. The two must be combined. The Party branch should strengthen ideological leadership, but it must never relax organizational leadership because of this. We should use various feasible methods to give play to the role of organizational supervision. For example, stipulate specific progress plans for study, supervise the progress of each participant according to the plan, urge everyone to abide by the system and discipline of collective study activities (including classes, discussions, examinations, etc.), Party small group meetings regularly check the study of party members, and Party branch committee members and Party small group leaders conduct individual talks with party members to check their studies.

(2) Conduct specific and meticulous ideological leadership over cadres' theoretical study. In the process of theoretical study, cadres often have various ideological problems or biases regarding the attitude, method, and mode of study. For example, they are not assiduous or humble in their attitude towards study, do not use their brains much, are impatient and greedy for more, have a one-sided view of the role of various study modes, have a one-sided understanding of the principle of collective study based on individual self-study, or doubt the significance of collective discussion, or have too high demands on collective discussion; rely on listening to reports and have too high demands on reports; and have various one-sided views on the theoretical connection to reality in terms of learning methods, either not connecting to reality or connecting indiscriminately. The Party branch should frequently and promptly understand the situation in the process of learning, analyze and study the ideological situation of various types of cadres, adopt various methods to mobilize, explain, or criticize, and guide cadres' learning onto a healthy development path.

(3) Organize and strive for the guidance forces for various studies within the branch members (such as comrades from senior groups, administrative responsible comrades, theoretical teachers, instructors) according to the possible conditions, and cooperate to carry out theoretical guidance. Of course, this requires different requirements based on the number of comrades with higher theoretical levels in each branch. Although the guidance work on theoretical content should be given more attention and concern by the higher-level Party committee, all branches should at least be able to do the following two points: First, introduce and urge cadres to use various learning materials issued by higher authorities, such as magazines, outlines, question and answer sessions, etc. The branch's ability to help everyone theoretically is very limited, so it should pay close attention to making good use of existing conditions. It often happens that some comrades feel that they cannot grasp the key points of study, but they put aside the study outline stipulated by the higher authorities without reading or studying it; some comrades' difficult problems cannot be solved, but in fact, these problems have already been answered in "Study" magazine or other study publications. The branch should prevent these situations from occurring. Second, we must frequently and promptly collect and reflect difficult problems in study to the higher authorities. Only by concentrating the problems in study in a timely manner can the higher-level study leading organs make appropriate answers. The method of "filtering at each level" can be used to answer questions, that is to say, each link in the study leadership must answer as many questions as possible that can be answered, and report the questions that it cannot answer to the higher level.

To do the above work, we must first require the Party organizations in government agencies to improve their sense of responsibility for leading cadres' theoretical study and truly regard leading study as the primary task of the Party branch in the agency. Organizationally, the branch committee should take leading study as the focus of the branch's work and frequently discuss study issues. In terms of the Party branch's leadership method for study, we should pay attention to relying on activists in study, organizing the core of study leadership, so as to drive the general comrades; we must summarize the typical experiences of individuals, groups, etc. in studying and promote them.

    机关的党组织必须具体领导干部理论学习
    中共北京市委宣传部  理论教育处处长  查汝强
    领导干部的理论学习是机关党组织的首要的经常工作。在“中国共产党党章”第五十二条中，规定支部任务的第四项是：“教育党员，组织党员的学习。”苏共中央书记苏斯洛夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的发言中说：“进行党的教育，以及监督共产党员具备马克思列宁主义必要的起码知识，是一切党组织的头等重要的任务。”共产党的组织不但要教育自己的党员，同时还应该负起向非党群众宣传马克思列宁主义的责任。
    不断提高干部的政治理论水平是保证完成行政任务的根本方法。斯大林同志说：“在国家工作和党工作任何一个部门中，工作人员底政治水准和马列主义觉悟程度愈高，工作本身也愈高，愈有成效，工作底结果也愈有效力”。因此，每一个机关的党组织都应该把领导干部的政治理论学习作为它的首要的经常工作，这是最明显不过的。
    现在很多机关的党组织的确是这样做的。但是也还有一些机关的党组织对这一点缺乏深刻的认识，放弃或放松了对干部政治理论学习的领导。他们或者藉口忙于党的组织工作，认为无暇及此，或者错误地将责任推诿给机关的学习委员会，满足于所谓“原则领导”，而实则对干部的学习问题很少过问。更多的机关的党组织虽已开始重视了干部理论教育工作，但还没有真正把领导学习当做自己的经常工作重心。支部书记很少过问学习问题，只推给宣传委员去单独负责，支部委员会很少或根本不讨论领导学习的问题，因而也就谈不到对学习的集体领导。
    目前机关党组织很多都已经注意建立学习的组织和制度，这是必要的。但在组织和制度建立之后，必须进一步注意思想领导和对理论学习内容的指导，才能使理论学习获得真实的效果。现在许多支部中管理学习的同志，对于了解、研究干部在学习中的具体思想情况重视不够，尤其是很少组织机关内的各种学习指导力量，给理论教员和辅导员的活动以具体的指导和帮助。总之，现在机关的党组织对干部学习的领导还落后于学习发展的需要。目前干部在学习中遇到很多困难，他们在学习态度和学习方法上还有不少缺点。如果党组织不加强对他们的学习的领导和帮助，就不能使他们得到很好的学习效果，也就不能使他们现有的学习热情巩固下来。因此加强机关党支部对干部理论学习的领导，是搞好干部理论教育工作的基本环节。
    我们应该要求机关党的基层组织——党支部在领导干部的理论学习方面做些什么工作呢？在这方面，需要而且可能做的工作是很多的。一般说来，有下列三方面工作：
    （一）在自愿的基础上坚持必要的学习制度，从组织上监督党员的理论学习。一方面要强调每个党员应有学习的自觉性，另一方面又要强调党组织对他们作严格监督，二者必须结合起来。党支部应该加强思想领导，但是决不能因此而放松组织领导。应该运用各种可行的办法来发挥组织监督的作用。如规定学习的具体进度计划，根据计划来监督每个参加学习者的进度，督促大家遵守集体学习活动（包括上课、讨论、考试等）的制度和纪律，党小组会定期检查党员的学习，党支部委员和党小组长与党员进行个别谈话来检查学习等。
    （二）对干部的理论学习进行具体的细致的思想领导。干部在理论学习过程中经常发生关于学习的态度、方法、方式等方面的各种思想问题或偏向，例如在学习态度上的不刻苦、不虚心，不多开动脑筋、急躁贪多、对各种学习方式的作用的片面看法，对在个人自修的基础上的集体学习的原则的片面了解，或者怀疑集体讨论的意义，或者对集体讨论的要求过高；依赖听报告，对报告的要求过高，以及在学习方法上对理论联系实际的各种片面看法，或者不联系实际或者乱联系一气等等。党支部应该在学习的过程中经常地及时地了解情况，对各类干部思想情况作分析研究，采用各种方法进行动员、解释或批判，引导干部学习走上健全发展的道路。
    （三）根据可能的条件组织和争取支部成员内各种学习的指导力量（如高级组的同志，行政负责同志，理论教员，辅导员），分工合作，进行理论指导。当然，这要根据各个支部内理论水平较高的同志的多寡来提出不同的要求。关于理论内容的指导工作虽然应由上级党委更多地重视和关心，但是所有支部至少应该也可能做到下列两点：一、介绍和督促干部利用上级所发的各种学习材料如杂志、提纲、问题解答等。支部在理论上帮助大家的能力很有限，那么就应该很好地注意利用已有的各种条件。往往有这样的情况：有些同志感觉学习抓不住重点，但又把上级规定的学习提纲放在一边不看、不研究；有些同志的疑难问题得不到解决，但事实上这些问题已经在“学习”杂志或其它学习刊物上有了解答。支部应该防止这些情况的发生。二、要经常及时地收集和向上级反映学习中的疑难问题。只有及时地将学习中的问题集中起来，上级学习领导机关才可能来作适当的解答。解答问题可以用“逐级过滤”的办法，就是说每个学习领导的环节都必须尽可能地解答一些能够解答的问题，而将它所不能解答的问题逐级汇报上去。
    要做到上面这些工作，首先就要求机关的党组织提高对领导干部理论学习的责任心，真正把领导学习作为机关党支部的首要工作。在组织上，支委会应以领导学习作为支部工作的重点，经常讨论学习问题。在支部对学习的领导方法上，要注意依靠学习的积极分子，组织学习领导的核心，以带动一般同志；要总结个人、小组等学习的典型经验，加以推广。
