In 1932, Mr. Feng Yuxiang advocated resistance against Japan and was ostracized by Chiang Kai-shek, and he retired to Mount Tai. In September 1946, Mr. Feng was sent to the United States by Chiang Kai-shek under the guise of being a "Special Envoy for Water Conservancy Investigation." Later, he publicly opposed Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial government in the United States and was stripped of his title as Special Envoy and expelled from the Kuomintang. On New Year's Day 1948, when the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was established, he was elected as the Chairman of the Political Committee of the Committee. In August of the same year, he left the United States to return to China, and on September 1, while traveling to the Black Sea, he died in a ship fire.

    冯玉祥先生遗体骨灰在泰山安葬
    【新华社济南二十日电】前中国国民党革命委员会政治委员会主席冯玉祥先生遗体骨灰已安葬于泰山西山麓。隆重的安葬仪式于十五日在泰山墓地举行。
    墓地上笼罩着庄严肃穆的气氛。墓前高挂着中央人民政府毛泽东主席、朱德副主席的题字。下面摆满了花圈。送花圈的机关有中央人民政府政务院，中共中央统一战线工作部，中国国民党革命委员会中央委员会，中国民主促进会，中国人民救济总会，中国红十字会总会，中国人民解放军海军司令部、政治部等，个人有宋庆龄、李济深、张澜、沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、康生等。
    参加安葬仪式的有中央人民政府李济深副主席，中国共产党中央委员会统一战线工作部副部长于毅夫，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副秘书长梅龚彬，中央人民政府委员会办公厅副主任余心清，中国国民党革命委员会中央常务委员于振瀛、王昆仑、邵力子、陈劭先、贺贵严、张治中、蒋光鼐和中央委员吕集义、吴茂荪、刘斐以及冯玉祥先生生前友好高树勋、赖亚力、王冶秋、王倬如、屈武、黄绍竑、王葆真、魏凤楼、傅华亭、高象九等人。此外，参加安葬仪式的还有中共中央山东分局统一战线工作部副部长赵笃生、山东省各界人民代表会议协商委员会副主席李澄之、中国国民党革命委员会山东省分部筹备委员会召集人范予遂、泰安专员公署专员王翰卿、泰安县人民政府县长罗祥临及泰安县各机关团体学校和当地居民共八百余人。
    安葬仪式在上午九时半开始，由李济深副主席主持。在哀乐声中，冯玉祥先生之长子冯洪国和次子冯洪达怀着悲痛的心情，手捧骨灰匣放入墓穴内。全体默哀三分钟。接着由李济深副主席致悼词，李德全夫人致答词，至十一时礼成。
    一九三二年，冯玉祥先生曾因主张抗日，遭到蒋介石的排斥，退隐泰山。一九四六年九月，冯先生又被蒋介石以所谓“考察水利专使”的名义遣往美国。后因在美国公开反对蒋介石独裁政府而被撤销了专使名义，并被开除国民党党籍。一九四八年元旦，中国国民党革命委员会成立时，被选为该会政治委员会主席。同年八月，离美返国，九月一日行至黑海，因轮船起火遇难。
