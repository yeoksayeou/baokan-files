    In Guangdong Province, farmers are making active preparations for winter planting during the slack season after the mid-season rice cultivation, aiming to maximize grain production and fully utilize the superior natural conditions of the subtropical climate. They are striving to expand the winter planting area in the province to approximately ten million mu, in order to grow crops such as wheat, buckwheat, and sweet potatoes.

    This year, the CCP Central Committee South China Branch and the Guangdong Province People's Government have attached great importance to farmers' winter production. As early as August, the CCP Central Committee South China Branch instructed Guangdong Province to treat this year's winter planting as a season of production, and instructed relevant departments to investigate and study farmers' original winter planting methods and experiences as soon as possible, in order to prepare for solving problems such as seeds and fertilizers, and improving farming methods. Subsequently, eastern Guangdong, northern Guangdong, and central Guangdong regions held relevant departmental meetings to study this year's winter planting work. In September, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Department of Food jointly allocated wheat, pea and other seeds to various administrative offices, and together with government loans for purchasing seeds, it can solve the problem of about two million catties of seeds. This will help solve the seed shortage problem in some areas. At the end of September, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry also organized three working groups to go to eastern, northern, and central Guangdong to specifically help solve problems such as seeds and fertilizers.

    Currently, the preparation work for winter planting production in Guangdong Province has achieved certain results. The Chen Baolong mutual aid team in Futang Township, Chao'an County, has formulated a winter planting plan and accumulated more than 28,000 catties of green manure for winter planting within ten days, driving six or seventy people in the village to go out to accumulate fertilizer every day. In Duruan Township, Xinhui County, the entire township combined winter planting with the patriotic health movement, accumulating more than 350,000 catties of miscellaneous fertilizer and green manure in a short period of time.

    Guangdong Province has a warm winter climate and adequate rainfall, which is suitable for winter planting production. Farmers generally have the habit of winter planting, and the cultivated area last year was about seven million mu. The spring harvest after winter planting each year is equivalent to one-quarter of the province's total annual grain output. (Xinhua News Agency)

    广东省农民积极准备冬耕
    广东省农民为尽最大力量增产粮食，充分利用亚热带气候的优越自然条件，正抓紧完成晚稻中耕后的农闲时间积极准备冬耕，争取全省冬耕面积扩大到一千万亩左右，以便种植小麦、荞麦、红薯等作物。
    今年，中共中央华南分局和广东省各级人民政府都很重视农民的冬季生产。早在八月间，中共中央华南分局就指示广东省要把今年的冬耕当作一季生产来进行，并指示各有关部门及早调查研究农民原有的冬耕方法和经验，为解决种籽和肥料、改进耕作法等作好准备。接着，粤东、粤北和粤中等地区都分别召开有关部门会议，研究了今年的冬耕工作。广东省人民政府农林厅、粮食厅九月份曾协同将小麦、豌豆等种籽拨到各行署，加上政府发出的购买种籽的贷款，共约可解决二百万斤种籽的问题。这样可使缺乏种籽地区的问题有所解决。九月底，广东省人民政府农林厅还组织了三个工作组到粤东、粤北和粤中等地具体帮助解决种籽、肥料等问题。
    现在，广东省各地农民冬耕生产准备工作已有
    一定成绩，潮安县福塘乡陈宝龙互助组已订出冬耕计划，并在十天内就为冬耕积得绿肥两万八千多斤，带动村里每天都有六、七十人外出积肥。新会县杜阮乡全乡结合爱国卫生运动，短期内就为冬耕积得杂肥和绿肥三十五万多斤。
    广东省冬季气候温暖并有适当雨量，宜于冬耕生产，农民也普遍有冬耕习惯，仅去年耕作面积就有七百万亩左右。每年冬耕后的春季收获量，相当于全省一年粮食总产量的四分之一。    （新华社）
