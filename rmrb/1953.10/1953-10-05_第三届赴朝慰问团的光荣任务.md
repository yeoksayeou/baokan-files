    The Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea departed yesterday. Under the current situation after the Korean armistice, the dispatch of such a large-scale delegation to Korea by the Chinese people has extremely important significance.
    The task of this delegation to Korea is to widely convey to the Volunteers the respect and solicitude of the people of the motherland, to report on the great achievements of domestic construction and the strong will of the people to resist America and aid Korea, and to encourage them to continue their efforts and heighten their vigilance in order to strive for the accurate realization of the Korean armistice agreement and to fight for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. At the same time, it will also express to the Korean military and civilians the cordial respect of the Chinese people, as well as the determination of our people to actively support them in healing the wounds of war and to support their great cause of striving for peace, unification, and independence.
    The realization of the Korean armistice is a great victory for the just struggle of the Korean and Chinese people against American aggression and for the defense of peace in the Far East and the world. It has dealt a serious blow to the aggressive plans of American aggressive forces to launch new wars in the Far East and Asia and to suppress the peoples of various countries in their struggle for freedom and independence, safeguarded peace in the Far East, and begun to ease international tensions somewhat. All peace-loving forces in various countries are taking the Korean armistice as a starting point and continuing to make firm efforts to strive for further easing of international tensions. After the victory in the war to defend the independence and freedom of their country, the Korean people are continuing to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question on the basis of national unification, and at the same time, with the extensive assistance of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, have begun to carry out the work of restoring and developing the people's economy that has been destroyed by the war.
    All peace-loving people in the world recognize the great contribution and immortal achievements of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies and the Korean people to peace in the Far East and the world. The Chinese people have even deeper feelings of gratitude and pride for the heroic deeds of the Korean military and civilians and our outstanding sons and daughters—the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    However, people cannot fail to see that the American aggressive forces are not reconciled to the failure they have suffered in Korea. Since the Korean armistice, they have been carrying out all kinds of conspiracies and tricks to systematically make the Korean armistice unstable and to try to sabotage the political conference. People know that the United States has formally signed a so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Syngman Rhee group in order to keep American troops stationed in South Korea indefinitely; at the same time, the US side is doing its utmost to obstruct and undermine the explanatory work for prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated; regarding the convening of the political conference, the United States, ignoring the correct proposals of the Korean and Chinese countries and the Soviet Union, and ignoring the reasonable wishes of most countries in the world, has used brutal pressure to force the Seventh United Nations General Assembly to make unilateral and unreasonable decisions, and has refused to continue discussing this issue at the Eighth United Nations General Assembly. The arrogant practices of the American aggressive forces clearly show that they are still attempting to continue to maintain tensions.
    The people of our country are constantly watching and are vigilant against these new conspiracies and tricks of the American aggressive forces. Therefore, while vigorously carrying out the planned economic construction of our motherland, the people of our country are determined to continue the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and to continue to support the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, until the Korean people's reconstruction work is completed and until the Korean question is finally resolved peacefully. The dispatch of the Third Delegation to Korea is precisely a manifestation of the close unity and sincere friendship of the Chinese people towards the Korean people.
    The delegation to Korea will meet with the heroes of the Volunteers in Korea. The Volunteer heroes who, together with the Korean People's Army and the Korean people, continue to fight for the accurate realization of the Korean armistice agreement and for the peaceful resolution of the Korean question, embody the great will of our motherland's people, bear the most glorious task of resisting America and aiding Korea, and are highly respected and fully supported by the people of the motherland. The dispatch of a delegation by the people of the motherland to visit them will make them feel deeply the concern and remembrance of the people of the motherland for them, and learn about the increasingly strong and prosperous appearance of the motherland, which will undoubtedly be a great source of encouragement to them. The care and support of the people of the motherland will surely make them full of confidence and fight to the end to accomplish the great task they are burdened with.
    The delegation to Korea will meet with the heroic Korean people and the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, and will see the great work that the Korean people have already begun to rebuild their country and strive for the peaceful reunification of Korea. The people of our country have unlimited respect for the heroism and fortitude shown by the Korean people in defending the freedom and independence of their country and in the great reconstruction work carried out after the war, and will continue to give their full support to their cause of rebuilding their country, just as they did during the war. In its congratulatory telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteers on September 12, the Central People's Government of China declared: "The Government and people of the People's Republic of China will do their best to help the heroic Korean people heal the wounds of war and restore peaceful life." The Korean people's work of rebuilding their country has also received the care and assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The Soviet-Korean talks held in Moscow not long ago decided that the huge sum of 1 billion rubles, which the Soviet Union allocated to the Korean people without compensation, would first be used to restore and build some factories that form the basis of the Korean people's economy. This huge and selfless assistance from the Soviet Union will undoubtedly play a major role in the Korean people's successful completion of their work of rebuilding their country. The people of our country firmly believe that under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, and with extensive international assistance and support, the Korean people will certainly be able to achieve great success in their work of rebuilding their country.
    The unity and friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples have been consolidated and strengthened through the test of the Korean War. The peace-loving people of all countries have regarded this fighting friendship and unity between the Korean and Chinese peoples, which is cemented by blood, as an important guarantee for defending and consolidating peace in the Far East. Therefore, the primary task at present is to continue to strengthen this unity between the two peoples and to further consolidate the unity between the two peoples and the peoples of all countries in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    The task undertaken by the Third Delegation to Korea is important and glorious. During the Korean War, our people twice sent delegations to Korea, which played a major role in inspiring the fighting will of our People's Volunteers, consolidating the unity between the Korean and Chinese peoples, and promoting the in-depth development of our movement to resist America and aid Korea. We believe that the Third Delegation to Korea, with the care and support of the people of the whole country, will certainly be able to complete its glorious task.

### 第三届赴朝慰问团的光荣任务

    第三届赴朝慰问团的光荣任务
    中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团已于昨日出发了。在朝鲜停战后的目前形势下，我国人民派遣了这样大的规模的慰问团去朝鲜，有着极其重大的意义。
    本届赴朝慰问团的任务，是向志愿军广泛传达祖国人民对他们的敬意和慰问，报告国内各项建设的伟大成就及全国人民的抗美援朝的坚强意志，鼓励他们继续努力，提高警惕，以争取朝鲜停战协定的确切实现，为和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗；同时并向朝鲜军民表达中国人民的亲切敬意，以及我国人民积极支援他们医治战争创伤和支持他们争取和平、统一与独立的伟大事业的决心。
    朝鲜停战的实现，是朝中人民反对美国侵略、保卫远东与世界和平的正义斗争的伟大胜利。它使美国侵略势力在远东及亚洲发动新战争、镇压各国人民争取自由独立的侵略计划受到了严重的打击，保卫住了远东的和平，并使国际紧张局势开始有些缓和。各国一切爱好和平的力量正以朝鲜停战为出发点，继续作坚定的努力，以争取国际紧张局势的进一步缓和。朝鲜人民在保卫祖国的独立自由的战争胜利之后，正继续为争取在全国统一的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗，同时并在苏联和各人民民主国家的广泛援助下，已开始进行恢复和发展被战争破坏了的人民经济的工作。
    全世界爱好和平的人民都承认朝中人民军队和朝鲜人民对远东与世界和平的伟大贡献和不朽的功绩，我国人民对朝鲜军民和我国的优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军的英雄业绩，更怀着深厚的感激和自傲的心情。
    但是，人们不能不看到美国侵略势力并不甘心他们在朝鲜所遭到的失败。在朝鲜停战以来，他们施展着各种各样的阴谋诡计，有计划地使朝鲜停战处于不稳定的状态，并力图破坏政治会议。人们知道，美国已与李承晚集团正式签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，以使美国军队继续无限期地留驻在南朝鲜；同时美方并对不直接遣返的战俘的解释工作极力加以阻挠和破坏；对政治会议的召开，美国不顾朝中两国和苏联的正确主张，不顾世界上大多数国家的合理愿望，以粗暴的压力强使第七届联合国大会作出了片面的、不合理的决定，并拒绝在第八届联合国大会上继续讨论这个问题。美国侵略势力的这种蛮横做法，清楚地表现了他们还在企图继续保持紧张局势。
    我国人民时时刻刻都在注视着和警惕着美国侵略势力的这种新的阴谋诡计。因此，我国人民在大力进行祖国有计划的经济建设的同时，决心继续进行抗美援朝运动，继续支援朝鲜人民和我国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，直到朝鲜人民重建工作完成，直到朝鲜问题最后和平解决为止。第三届赴朝慰问团的派遣，正是我国人民对朝鲜人民的亲密团结和真诚友谊的表现。
    赴朝慰问团在朝鲜将与志愿军英雄们见面。与朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民一道为争取朝鲜停战协定的确切实现、为和平解决朝鲜问题而继续奋斗的志愿军英雄们，体现着我们祖国人民的伟大意志，负担着抗美援朝的最光荣的任务，受到祖国人民的最高的崇敬和全力支援。祖国人民派遣慰问团访问他们，将使他们亲切地感觉到祖国人民对他们的关怀和感念，获知祖国日益强大繁盛的面貌，这对他们无疑是一个巨大的鼓舞力量。祖国人民的关怀和支援，一定会使他们信心百倍地为完成他们所负担的伟大任务而奋斗到底。
    赴朝慰问团在朝鲜将与英勇的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军的将士们见面，并将看到朝鲜人民已经开始的重建祖国、争取朝鲜和平统一的伟大工作。我国人民对朝鲜人民保卫祖国的自由独立以及在战后所展开的伟大恢复工作中所表现的英雄气概和刚毅精神，怀着无限的敬意，并对他们重建祖国的事业将如在战争中一样，继续给以全力的支持。我中央人民政府在九月十二日致中国人民志愿军的慰问电中宣告：“中华人民共和国政府和人民将尽力来帮助英雄的朝鲜人民医治战争创伤，恢复和平生活。”朝鲜人民重建祖国的工作并得到苏联、各人民民主国家的关怀和援助。不久之前在莫斯科举行的苏朝会谈，已决定将苏联无代价地拨给朝鲜人民的十亿卢布巨款，首先用于恢复建设朝鲜人民经济基础的一些工厂。苏联这种巨大的、无私的援助，在朝鲜人民顺利完成其重建祖国工作中无疑将发生重大的作用。我国人民深信：在朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅的领导之下，在广泛的国际援助和支持之下，朝鲜人民一定能够在他们重建祖国的工作中取得重大的成就。
    朝中人民的团结和友谊通过朝鲜战争的考验而巩固和加强了。各国爱好和平人民，已把朝中人民这种以鲜血凝结起来的战斗友谊和团结，看作为保卫和巩固远东和平的重要保证。因而，目前的首要任务是继续加强两国人民的这种团结，并使两国人民与以苏联为首的和平民主阵营各国人民之间的团结更加巩固起来。
    第三届赴朝慰问团所负担的任务是重大而光荣的。在朝鲜战争期间，我国人民曾两度派遣慰问团赴朝，对鼓舞我国人民志愿军的战斗意志，巩固朝中两国人民的团结，推动我国抗美援朝运动的深入发展都起了重大的作用。我们相信第三届赴朝慰问团在全国人民的关怀和支持下，也一定能够完成它的光荣任务。
