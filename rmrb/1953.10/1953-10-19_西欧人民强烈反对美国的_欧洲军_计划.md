(Xinhua News Agency, 16th) The United States has been trying to accelerate the establishment of a "European Army" since the West German elections, but it continues to face strong obstacles, namely the strong opposition of the Western European people. Currently, almost all levels of people in Western European countries are fiercely condemning this plan to revive West German militarism and enable it to re-dominate Western Europe.

After the United States supported the Adenauer group's continued rule in the West German elections through terror, Adenauer, encouraged by the United States, arrogantly threatened France and other Western European countries that they must approve the "European Army" treaty in the "shortest possible time," otherwise West Germany would rebuild its army on its own. Officials of the Adenauer government recently publicly announced that more than 100,000 "volunteers" in West Germany are ready to wear the uniforms of the "European Army." The United States is also directly exerting enormous pressure on France and other Western European countries. The United States threatened France that if France did not quickly approve the "European Army" treaty, the United States would stop giving "aid"; if France did not agree to rebuild the West German army under the guise of the "European Army," the United States would rebuild the West German army by pulling West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

However, the more the United States forces Western Europe to quickly establish the "European Army," the more this conspiracy is opposed by the Western European public.

Opposition comes first from France. The French National Peace Council and many provincial peace councils have recently adopted decisions to strengthen the struggle against the "European Army" treaty. People in various places are holding rallies against the "European Army" treaty. From October 25th to November 25th, 56 provinces across France will launch large-scale mass protests against the rearmament of West Germany. Now people from all parties in France—members of the Communist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, the "Independent Republican Party," and the People's Republican Movement—are participating in the movement against the "European Army." The unity shown by the public of all classes and political views in France in opposing the "European Army" is unprecedented since the French Resistance movement against the German fascist occupation during World War II.

The people's protests have already affected the attitudes of many political figures in France. Two hundred bourgeois members of the French parliament and senators have formed a national committee against the ratification of the "European Army" treaty. This committee recently sent a letter to Belgian parliamentarians, asking them to establish a national committee of the same nature and to appoint representatives to jointly establish a European committee against the "European Army" in the shortest possible time. The number of people within the French ruling group who oppose the "European Army" is increasing. A considerable number of influential figures in the de Gaulle faction and the Radical Socialist Party, including party leader Herriot, oppose the current form of the "European Army." Even some ministers in the French cabinet oppose the current "unified" Europe plan.

In other Western European countries, hatred of the "European Army" treaty is also widespread. The people's movement against the establishment of the "European Army" in Belgium and the Netherlands is continuing to develop. Many rallies protesting the establishment of the "European Army" have recently been held in various parts of Italy. Speakers at these rallies included not only representatives of democratic parties and organizations, but also members of the Liberal Party and the Christian Democratic Party.

### 西欧人民强烈反对美国的“欧洲军”计划

    西欧人民强烈反对美国的“欧洲军”计划
    【新华社十六日讯】美国在西德选举后就竭力企图加快成立“欧洲军”的步伐，但是它却继续遭到强大的障碍，那就是西欧人民的强烈反对。目前，西欧各国几乎是各阶层的人士都在激烈谴责这个复活西德军国主义及使其重新统治西欧的计划。
    在美国支持阿登纳集团在西德选举中用恐怖手段继续执政以后，阿登纳就在美国的鼓励下嚣张地要挟法国及其他西欧国家必须在“最短期内”批准“欧洲军”条约，否则西德就要自行重建军队。阿登纳政府的官员最近并公然宣布西德已有十万多“志愿者”准备穿上“欧洲军”的制服。美国并且直接向法国及其他西欧国家行使巨大压力。美国向法国威胁说，如果法国不赶快批准“欧洲军”条约，美国就要停止给予“援助”；如果法国不同意在    “欧洲军”的招牌下，重建西德军队，美国就要用把西德拉入北大西洋集团的形式来重建西德军队。
    但是，美国愈是强迫西欧赶快建立“欧洲军”，这个阴谋就愈是遭到西欧公众的反对。
    反对首先来自法国。法国全国和平理事会以及许多省的和平理事会最近都通过了加强反对“欧洲军”条约斗争的决定。各地人民正纷纷举行反对“欧洲军”条约的大会。从十月二十五日到十一月二十五日，全法国将有五十六个省要展开规模宏大的群众抗议运动，反对重新武装西德。现在法国各党派人士——共产党、激进社会党、“独立共和党”和人民共和党的党员都参加了反对“欧洲军”的运动。法国各阶层、各种政治见解的公众在反对“欧洲军”上所表现的一致，是在第二次世界大战期间法国反抗德国法西斯占领的抵抗运动以来所从来没有过的。
    人民的抗议已经影响到法国许多政界人士的态度。法国两百个资产阶级议员和参议员成立了反对批准“欧洲军”条约的全国委员会。这个委员会最近并致函比利时议员，要求他们成立一个同样性质的全国委员会，并指派代表共同在最短期间成立反对“欧洲军”的欧洲委员会。法国统治集团内部反对“欧洲军”的人越来越多，戴高乐派及激进社会党中包括党魁赫里欧在内的相当一部分有势力人士都反对目前形式的“欧洲军”。甚至在法国内阁中也有一些部长反对目前的“统一”欧洲计划。
    在西欧其他国家，憎恨“欧洲军”条约的情绪也十分普遍。比利时和荷兰全国反对建立“欧洲军”的人民运动正在继续开展。意大利各地最近举行了许多抗议建立“欧洲军”的集会，在这些集会上发言的不仅有民主党派和组织的代表，而且还有自由党和天主教民主党的党员。
