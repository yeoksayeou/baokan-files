Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th. In the name of "aid," the American aggressors have obtained even greater privileges for economic plunder in South Korea, in order to dump large quantities of surplus goods into South Korea and supply the Syngman Rhee gang with more munitions.

According to South Korea's "Dongyang News Agency," the South Korean puppet National Assembly passed the so-called "Revised Customs Law Bill" on September 25. According to this traitorous bill, goods imported into South Korea "for the purpose of aid by the United Nations or foreign governments," or "airplanes and airplane parts," or ships over one hundred tons, are exempt from import duties. This bill greatly facilitates the import of American goods and munitions.

South Korea under the rule of the US-Rhee regime already has a shockingly large trade deficit. According to statistics from the puppet "Bank of Korea," the total value of South Korea's trade exports in 1952 was 200,364.4 million won, and the value of imports was 704,419 million won, with a trade deficit of 504,055 million won. The trade deficit increased even more sharply in 1953, reaching 122.4 billion won in just January and February.

Moreover, according to statistics, during the two and a half years from the beginning of June 1950 to the end of November 1952, the United States, in the name of "aid," sold more than $570 million worth of surplus goods to South Korea. These surplus goods are all food, textiles, cosmetics, daily necessities, and airplanes, tanks, ships, weapons and ammunition that South Korea can produce, and are used to slaughter the people.

    美国在南朝鲜进行经济掠夺
    【新华社平壤七日电】美国侵略者以“援助”为名，在南朝鲜取得了更大的进行经济掠夺的特权，以便向南朝鲜大量倾销剩余商品并供给李承晚匪帮更多的军火。
    据南朝鲜“东洋通讯社”透露：南朝鲜伪国会在九月二十五日通过了所谓“关税法改订法案”。依照这个卖国的法案，凡是“由联合国或外国政府以援助为目的”，向南朝鲜输入商品或“飞机及飞机零件”或一百吨以上的船只时，得免征入口税。这个法案大大便利了美国商品和军火的进口。
    美李统治下的南朝鲜本来就有着惊人的庞大贸易入超。据伪“韩国银行”统计：一九五二年度南朝鲜贸易总输出额为二千零三亿六千四百万圆，输入额为七千零四十四亿一千九百万圆，入超达五千零四十亿五千五百万圆。一九五三年度入超更急遽地增加，只一月和二月两个月份，入超就达到一千二百二十四亿圆。
    不仅如此，据统计，在从一九五零年六月初到一九五二年十一月末的两年半期间，美国以“援助”为名，向南朝鲜推销了价值五亿七千多万美元的剩余商品。这些剩余商品全是南朝鲜可以生产的粮食、食品、棉织物和化妆品、日用品和用以屠杀人民的飞机、坦克、舰船、武器和弹药等。
