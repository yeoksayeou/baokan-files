Bumper Harvests on Both Sides of the Jing River Lead to Unprecedented Prosperity in Urban and Rural Economies; Farmers Actively Sell Grain, Purchase Production Materials, and Expand Production

Following the completion of the Jing River Flood Diversion Project, the urban and rural areas on both sides of the Jing River have experienced unprecedented prosperity. After consecutive bumper harvests, farmers are enthusiastically selling grain to the state, actively purchasing production materials, and preparing for large-scale production next year.

Last year, immediately after the completion of the first phase of the Jing River Flood Diversion Project, more than 30 million mu of crops on both sides of the Jing River achieved universal bumper harvests, generally increasing production by 10% to 30% compared to 1951. The thirteen counties under the Jingzhou Special District of Hubei Province alone increased rice production by approximately 500 million jin and cotton by approximately 100,000 dan. Among them, Jianli County, which is close to the Jing River levee, recovered more than 300,000 mu of good farmland from the accumulated water that used to flow in, increasing the county's cultivated area by a quarter and its output by a half compared to before liberation. This year is the second year of bumper harvests in the Jing River basin after the completion of the flood diversion project. The output of rice, cotton, wheat, miscellaneous grains, and aquatic products in various places has generally increased by 5% to 20%, and in some cases by more than double. In the Jianghan Plain, Jiangling, Jianli, Honghu, Qianjiang, Mianyang, Hanchuan, and Hanyang counties have all increased their mid-season rice and wheat production by about 20%, increasing the output of raw grain by no less than 1 billion jin. Qianjiang County, which suffered from floods and poor harvests every year before liberation, has also achieved a bumper harvest of soybeans and millet this year, with wheat production increasing by nearly double compared to the year before. The cotton yield of the state-owned Jingzhou Prefectural Farm is 200 to 300 jin per mu, an increase of 45% over last year. The People's Great Embankment (north bank of the Jing River), opened up during the Jing River Flood Diversion Project, has a total of more than 230,000 mu of cultivated land. Last year, it already had a bumper harvest in one season. This year, rice yields can reach more than 500 jin per mu, doubling last year's yield, and cotton yields can reach 150 jin per mu, an increase of 50% to 60% over last year. The "granary" on the right bank of the Jing River – the Dongting Lake area of Hunan Province – also saw bumper harvests of early and mid-season rice this year. The yield of 5 million mu of mid-season rice averaged more than 500 jin per mu, an increase of more than 10% over last year. Jingjiang County in the flood diversion area saw a general increase of 20% to 30% in the output of various crops this year compared to last year, with some increasing by more than double.

The completion of the Jing River Flood Diversion also ensured the smooth navigation of the Jing River section. During the flood diversion project, the advanced Soviet experience – the one-line towing method – was first adopted, breaking the conservative view that "the Jing River cannot be navigated at night." Later, the Yangtze River Navigation Leading Authority promoted these experiences and carried out tasks such as modifying and adding markers, and repairing shoal wharves in the Jing River section, ensuring smooth navigation on the Yangtze River in all seasons. During the peak season with wide waters and abundant goods, it can transport more than 10,000 tons of materials per day. The total transportation volume this year is expected to increase by more than 18% compared to last year. The transportation of timber, bricks, tiles, steel, cement, grain, cotton, and other items has increased by one to twenty-seven times compared to the same period last year. Transportation prices have decreased by 30% to 80% compared to 1950.

With the bumper harvests and the development of Yangtze River shipping, the large and small towns on both sides of the Jing River have also rapidly prospered. In Shashi, near the Jing River levee, the planned area for basic construction projects in the city this year is more than 12,500 square meters, and the construction area within the city is more than 3,000 square meters. Basic construction projects and factory production in the first half of the year have all completed or exceeded planned targets. In terms of trade, taking the sales volume of general merchandise as an example, it increased by more than double in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year, and salt increased by two times. Xinchang (under the jurisdiction of Shishou County, Hubei), which is located on the north bank of the Jing River, was just a small street with seventy households two years ago. Now, two new streets have been built, developing into a prosperous town with more than three hundred households. In addition to the increase in the number of department stores and cloth shops in the town, farm implement yards and machine rice mills have also appeared.

The bumper harvests of the past two years, coupled with a series of social reforms carried out in the countryside after liberation, have given the rural areas on both sides of the Jing River a new look. Every household is filled with grain, and the threshing floors are piled high with straw. The well-fed and clothed farmers are enthusiastically selling their surplus grain and cotton to the state, purchasing large quantities of production materials, and actively preparing for further production. The purchase volume of wheat in Hubei Province in August this year increased by about 145% compared to the same period last year. The purchase of rice increased by about 40% compared to the same period last year. In terms of purchasing production materials, taking Jingjiang County as an example, the 180,000 farmers in the county added 593 oxen, 305 carts, and 618 wooden boats in the first half of this year alone. The county's supply and marketing cooperatives sold 44,000 jin of cake fertilizer last year, and have already sold 200,000 jin in the first three quarters of this year. The Ding Hesheng mutual aid group in the third district spent 1.55 million yuan just on purchasing buckets, sickles, and fertilizers after the autumn harvest, and plans to buy another ox and two plows. Farmers in the fifth district have also deposited more than 100,000 jin of grain and more than 170 million yuan in the bank with the supply and marketing cooperatives and banks. This year, the rice fields on both sides of the Jing River have generally been plowed three times and harrowed four times, and weeds have been hoed three or four times. Cotton has been weeded up to eleven times in most cases. At present, the winter plowing, winter planting, manure accumulation, and increased production and economy campaign are being launched in the rural areas on both sides of the Jing River. Mid-season rice fields are being plowed, and some have been plowed and harrowed twice. Winter planting has already begun in some areas, requiring that no acre of land be left vacant, striving for another bumper harvest next spring. (Tang Changtai)

    荆江两岸连获丰收城乡经济空前繁荣
    农民踊跃售粮购买生产资料扩大生产
    荆江分洪工程完成后，荆江两岸城乡空前繁荣，连获丰收后的农民，踊跃把粮食卖给国家，积极添购生产资料，准备明年大生产。
    去年，荆江分洪第一期工程刚刚完成，荆江两岸三千万亩以上农作物就普遍丰收，一般比一九五一年增产一成到三成，仅湖北省荆州专区所属十三个县，就增产稻谷约五亿斤，棉花约十万担。其中紧挨荆江大堤的江陵县，从过去倒口流进去的积水中救出良田三十余万亩，使全县耕田面积比解放前增加四分之一，产量增加了二分之一。今年是荆江流域在分洪工程完成后的第二个丰收年，各地水稻、棉花、小麦、杂粮、水产，一般的都增产了半成到二成，有的增产到一倍以上。江汉平原上的江陵、监利、洪湖、潜江、沔阳、汉川、汉阳各县，今年中稻和麦子都增产二成左右，增产的原粮不下十亿斤。解放前年年遭水淹歉收的潜江县，今年黄豆、粟谷也大获丰收，小麦比前年增产将近一倍。国营荆州专署农场的棉花每亩可收二百斤到三百斤，比去年增产四成半。在荆江分洪工程中开辟的人民大垸
    （荆江北岸），共二十三万多亩耕地，去年已丰收了一季，今年水稻每亩可收五百多斤，比去年又增加一倍，棉花每亩可收一百五十斤，比去年增产五六成。荆江右岸的“米仓”——湖南省洞庭湖滨湖地区，今年早稻、中稻也都丰收，五百万亩中稻每亩收成均在五百斤以上，比去年增产一成多。分洪区的荆江县，今年各种农作物普遍比去年增产二成到三成，部分增产一倍多。
    荆江分洪完成后，还保证了荆江段航运的畅通。在分洪工程进行中，首先采用了苏联先进经验——一列式拖拉法，打破了“荆江不能夜航”的保守观点。后来长江航务领导机关将这些经验推广，又在荆江段进行了改标，添标，修整洲滩码头等工作，使长江航运四季畅通。在水阔货旺的季节里，一日可运物资万吨以上。今年运输总量预计可比去年增加百分之十八以上。木材、砖瓦、钢料、水泥、粮食、棉花等项运输，比去年同时上升一倍到二十七倍。运价比一九五○年降低了百分之三十到八十。
    随着丰收和长江航运的发展，荆江两岸的大城小镇也迅速繁荣起来。靠近荆江大堤的沙市，今年全市基本建设工程计划面积共一万二千五百多平方公尺，市内建设面积三千多平方公尺。上半年基本建设工程和各工厂生产，都完成或超额完成计划指标。在贸易上以百货销售额为例，今年上半年就比去年同期增加一倍多，食盐增加两倍，靠荆江北岸的新厂（属湖北石首县），两年前只是一条七十来户的小街，现在新建了两条街，发展成三百多户的繁荣市镇，镇上除百货、布匹商店数字增加外，还出现了农具场和机器米厂。
    两年的丰收，加上解放后农村中进行了一系列的社会改革，荆江两岸的农村已面貌一新，家家粮食满屯，场边也堆满谷草。丰衣足食的农民，都踊跃地把余粮和棉花卖给国家，大批买进生产资料，积极准备再生产。湖北省今年八月份完成的小麦收购量，比去年同时约增加百分之一百四十五。稻谷收购比去年同时约增加百分之四十。在购买生产资料方面，以荆江县为例，全县十八万农民在今年上半年中就添购耕牛五百九十三条，大车三百零五部，木船六百一十八只。全县供销合作社去年卖出饼肥四万四千斤，今年头三季中已卖出了二十万斤。三区丁和生互助组，光是秋收以后购买板桶、镰刀、肥料等就用去一百五十五万元，还打算再买耕牛一条，犁二张。五区农民还向供销合作社存粮食十万多斤，向银行存款一亿七千多万元。今年荆江两岸的水稻田，普遍做到三犁四耙，薅草三、四道，棉花最多的锄草十一道。目前，冬耕、冬种、积肥和增产节约运动正在荆江两岸农村中展开，中稻田普遍翻耕，有的已耕耙两次，部分地区冬种已经开始，要求不留一亩空田，争取明春再来一个大丰收。    （唐昌泰）
