    Sichuan Province Adapts to This Year's Bumper Harvest of Autumn Crops; Procurement Work is Proceeding Smoothly as Planned
    Sichuan Province has once again achieved a bumper harvest of autumn crops this year. Large quantities of autumn grain are pouring into the market, the amount entering the market is increasing daily, and procurement work is proceeding smoothly as planned.
    In order to adapt to the increased grain sales by farmers after the bumper autumn harvest and to meet the needs of national economic construction, this year's autumn grain procurement plan has been appropriately increased compared to last year. The Sichuan Provincial People's Government Grain Bureau and the Preparatory Committee of the Provincial Cooperative Federation signed a grain purchase agreement in early August. The agreement stipulates that the cooperative system should bear 70 percent of this year's autumn grain procurement plan, and the autumn grain procurement work in most townships and towns throughout the province is entrusted to the cooperatives for purchase.
    Party committees and governments at all levels attach great importance to the work of procuring autumn grain. Under the leadership of the local Financial and Economic Committees, all special districts and counties have successively established "Autumn Grain Procurement Offices" with the participation of state-owned trade, cooperatives, grain, banking, taxation and other financial and economic departments to strengthen unified leadership, so that relevant departments can support and cooperate with each other, and so that purchasing and marketing work can be closely integrated, overcoming the tendency of decentralism in financial and economic work in the past. Therefore, this year's procurement work has been greatly improved compared to last year. Yibin County only set up twenty-three procurement points throughout the county last year, but this year it has doubled. In addition to setting up key procurement stations in the larger twenty-three distribution markets in the county, Changshou County also organized a number of mobile procurement teams to set up temporary procurement offices in the countryside to expand the scope of grain procurement. As of now, more than two thousand procurement points have been established throughout the province. In terms of procurement procedures, most of the grain bureaus in Jiangjin, Suining, Luzhou, Neijiang and other special districts, starting from checking and summarizing the experience and lessons learned in this year's summer wheat procurement work, studied ways to improve based on the principle of how to make it more convenient for farmers to sell grain, prepared more ample manpower and material resources, and tried to simplify procurement procedures as much as possible to achieve both speed and quality. The grass-roots supply and marketing cooperatives in Rongchang County achieved frequent, zero-lot, daily, and on-demand procurement in terms of procurement time; when there are an unusually large number of farmers selling grain, temporary staff and scales are added, which the masses are very satisfied with. In terms of correctly implementing grade price differences, grain departments and cooperative grain purchasers in many areas have come up with some methods. The grain department in the Ninth District of Yongchuan County adopted the method of concentrating cadres to learn grading technology before procurement to improve the business level of cadres; during procurement, samples were put out as standards. In the grading work, the cadres of Gelan Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Changshou County, in addition to paying attention to strengthening learning from grain depot cadres, also adopted the method of inviting farmers with experience in identifying grain quality to conduct democratic evaluation to determine the quality grade when encountering difficulties. The effect of this method has been very good since its implementation. On the one hand, it can improve the grading technology of cooperative cadres; on the other hand, it can educate the masses.
    After the autumn grain procurement work was launched, the purchasing power of farmers has greatly increased, and the sales volume of industrial products, especially handicrafts, needed by farmers has greatly increased. Before the autumn grain procurement, the average turnover of the supply department of the Rongchang County Cooperative Federation was only more than 2 million yuan every three days. After the autumn grain procurement, the average turnover every three days reached more than 20 million yuan, an increase of nine times. In its supply work, the Tongliang County Cooperative Federation adopted the method of processing and supplying materials locally, organized thirteen iron furnace production groups and a casting plow factory to repair old farm tools and manufacture new farm tools, and ordered goods from local handicraft plow factories. In ordering goods, attention was paid to helping handicraft households improve their technology and improve product quality so that they would be suitable for farmers' needs. All areas that have met the purchasing and sales requirements of farmers have both completed the state's grain purchase plan and promoted autumn agricultural production and the development of cooperatives.
    The urgent problems to be solved in the current grain purchase work are: 1. Some state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in some areas have underestimated the increase in farmers' purchasing power after this year's bumper autumn harvest, and have not prepared enough supply materials, resulting in out-of-stock phenomena. It is necessary to immediately expand the organization of goods and actively supply them. 2. In the implementation of grade price differences, some cadres have the idea of "rather high than low, rather strict than wide" and raise the grading standards. The grading technology of some cadres is not high enough, resulting in deviations in grading, which must be corrected in time. 3. It has been found that some illegal private merchants are intercepting and suppressing prices to purchase autumn grain in rural areas, or raising prices to grab autumn grain, deliberately creating market price confusion. Local industrial and commercial administrative departments and relevant commercial departments should strengthen market management to stop the speculative behavior of illegal private merchants.

    四川省适应今年大秋作物丰收情况
    收购工作正按计划顺利开展
    四川省今年大秋作物又获丰收。大批秋粮涌入市场，上市量逐日上升，收购工作正按计划顺利开展中。
    为了适应秋粮丰收后农民售粮增加和国家经济建设的需要，今年的秋粮收购计划比去年适当增加。四川省人民政府粮食厅与省合作社联合社筹备委员会在八月上旬签订了购粮协议书，协议书规定合作社系统应负担今年秋粮收购计划的百分之七十，全省绝大部分乡镇的秋粮收购工作，都委托合作社代购。
    各地党委、政府都很重视收购秋粮工作。各专区、县在当地财政经济委员会的领导下，都已先后成立了包括国营贸易、合作社、粮食、银行、税收等财经部门参加的“秋粮收购办公室”，以加强统一领导，使有关部门互相支持、配合，使购销工作密切结合，克服过去财经工作中的分散主义倾向。因此，今年的收购工作较去年有很大改进。宜宾县去年全县只设了二十三个收购点，今年增加了一倍。长寿县除在全县较大的二十三个集散市场分别设立了重点收购站外，还组织了若干流动收购小组，下乡设立临时收购处，扩大粮食收购面。截至目前止，全省共设立了两千多个收购点。在收购手续上，江津、遂宁、泸州、内江等大多数专区的粮食局，从检查和总结今年夏季收购小麦工作中的经验教训着手，根据如何更能便利农民售粮的原则，研究了改进办法，准备了更充裕的人力、物力，尽量简化收购手续，做到既快又好。荣昌县各基层供销合作社在收购时间上做到了勤收、零收、天天收、随到随收；如遇卖粮农民特别多时，临时添人、添秤，群众很满意。在正确贯彻等级差价方面，不少地区的粮食部门和合作社购粮人员想出了一些办法。永川县九区粮食部门在收购前，采用集中干部学习验级技术的办法，以提高干部的业务水平；在收购时，又把样品摆出来作标准。长寿县葛兰供销合作社干部在验级工作中，除注意加强向粮库干部学习外，遇到疑难时，还采取了邀集对辨识粮食品质有经验的农民，进行民主评议，确定品质等级。这个办法实行以来，效果很好，一方面可以提高合作社干部的验级技术；一方面可以教育群众。
    收购秋粮工作展开后，农民购买力大大提高，凡是农民所需要的工业品，尤其是手工业品，销售量大增。荣昌县合作社联合社在没有收购秋粮前，供应部每三天的平均营业额只有两百多万元，收购秋粮后，每三天平均营业额达两千多万元，增加了九倍。铜梁县合作社联合社在供应工作中，采取就地取材加工供应的办法，组织了十三个铁炉生产组和一个铸铧厂，进行修整旧农具和制造新农具，并向当地手工业铧厂订货。在订货中，注意了帮助手工业户改进技术，提高产品质量，使其适合农民需要。凡满足了农民购销要求的地区，都是既完成了国家购粮计划，又推动了秋季农业生产和合作社的发展。
    目前购粮工作中急需解决的几个问题是：一、部分地区的国营商业部门和合作社对今年秋粮丰收后农民购买力增长的情况估计不足，对供应物资的准备不够，发生脱销现象。必须立刻扩大组织货源，积极供应。二、在贯彻等级差价工作中，部分干部有“宁高勿低，宁严勿宽”，提高验级标准的思想。部分干部验级技术还不高，致使验级中发生了偏差，必须及时纠正。三、目前已发现部分不法私商在农村中拦路压价套购，或提价抢购秋粮，故意制造市场价格混乱的情况。当地工商行政部门及有关商业部门应加强市场管理工作，以制止不法私商的投机行为。（之琛）
