The China National Department Store Corporation and the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation recently issued instructions requiring their subordinate units to earnestly implement the instructions of the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government on increasing production and practicing economy, to cooperate with agricultural product procurement, vigorously organize sales, and strive to overfulfill sales plans.

The instructions of both the China National Department Store Corporation and the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation emphasized that vigorous sales should be the central task after the autumn harvest. The China National Department Store Corporation instructed the national state-owned department store system to implement the business policy of wholesale as the main focus in sales. First, it is necessary to closely integrate with cooperatives, fully supply cooperatives with materials, and resolutely implement the preferential rate of 3%; if cooperatives have financial difficulties, short-term sales on credit without returns for seven to ten days can be used to assist them, and cooperatives should be helped to improve their sales business. Stores should invite grassroots cooperatives to hold supply meetings to expand the supply of goods to cooperatives. In addition, they should convene private retailers, peddlers, and private merchants engaged in transportation between urban and rural areas to hold forums, mobilize them to purchase goods from state-owned wholesale stores locally, implement national price policies, and quickly transport goods to consumers. The instructions of the China National Department Store Corporation further pointed out: In order to cooperate with the procurement of grain and other agricultural products, commodities suitable for farmers' needs should be supplied to rural areas as soon as possible, especially paying attention to the supply to grain-producing areas. The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation required the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth system to earnestly implement the policy of close integration with cooperatives, and all varieties should be supplied to cooperatives first, and preferential treatment should be given as stipulated, to ensure that cotton cloth can penetrate into grain-producing areas and cash crop areas, and meet the needs of the vast rural areas.

The instructions of the China National Department Store Corporation and the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation also required their subordinate units to continue to organize sources of goods, expand purchases in a planned manner, and pay attention to making product quality, varieties, patterns, and specifications suitable for consumer needs. These two instructions also required their subordinate units to strengthen commodity transportation and coordination work.

In addition, the instructions of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation also required the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth system to pay attention to strengthening cotton procurement and storage. The instructions stated: The amount of cotton purchased in November will increase, and cotton yarn and cloth companies in various places should make full preparations to ensure that funds are not disrupted, and closely contact cotton inspection agencies and cooperatives to do a good job in grade inspection. At the same time, a regular inspection system for cotton storage should be established.

Furthermore, the All-China Committee of the National Textile and Department Store Workers' Union recently issued a notice calling on employees in state-owned trade departments to launch a labor emulation drive to increase production and practice economy, and to ensure the comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of national plans.

The notice said: In order to complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy, all employees in state-owned trade departments must further improve their work enthusiasm and sense of responsibility, overcome the idea of underestimating commerce, seriously discuss national plans, formulate guarantee plans for groups and individuals to complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy, and actively launch labor emulation drives.

The notice requires trade union organizations at all levels to do the following: 1. Publicize the significance of increasing production and practicing economy to the broad masses of employees, and focus on political and ideological education and the consolidation of labor discipline, so that the masses of employees further establish a new labor attitude of serving the people. 2. Based on the specific tasks of increasing production and practicing economy, go deep into the key departments of increasing production and practicing economy, and mobilize the masses to solve the key problems in these departments to complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy. 3. Proceeding from encouraging production, correctly use bonuses.
