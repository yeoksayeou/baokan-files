    Partial Engineering Trial Run of Sugar Machine Workshop at State-Owned Guangdong Zini Sugar Factory Shows Good Results

    The newly built state-owned Guangdong Zini Sugar Factory's sugar machine workshop began trial runs of some of its engineering projects on the evenings of October 5th, 7th, 9th, and 10th, for a total of four days. The trial runs produced good results.

    The equipment involved in this trial run included: white sugar elevators, cane juice neutralizers, syrup neutralizers, syrup settling tanks, sugar paste mixers, brown sugar paste mixers, vibrating troughs, mud juice tanks, and turbid juice tanks. Before the trial run, technicians, team leaders, group leaders, and technical staff conducted multiple inspections with a conscientious and responsible spirit. The trial run proceeded effectively: bearings did not overheat, operation was normal, and there were no extraneous noises. During the trial run, although there were some minor issues, such as some sugar buckets on the white sugar elevator hitting the machine body, and the motor frame of the mud juice tank not being strong enough, causing some vibration when the machine started, the technicians quickly repaired these issues by fully utilizing their labor enthusiasm and creative initiative.

    Zini Sugar Factory is a relatively large-scale sugarcane sugar factory with an annual production capacity of 30,000 tons of sugar. Construction began in October 1952, and earthwork construction fully commenced in February of this year. Steel frame installation was completed in April. Currently, if some equipment can arrive in a timely manner, production is expected to begin in December. The upcoming projects at the factory include vacuum pumps, crystallizing pans, and cane juice pumps. Other unfinished projects are being expedited to ensure timely or even earlier trial runs.

    国营广东紫坭糖厂糖机车间部分工程试机效果良好
    新建国营广东紫坭糖厂糖机车间部分工程在十月五、七、九、十日四天晚上开始试机。试机效果良好。
    参加这次试机的有：白糖上升机、蔗汁中和器、糖浆中和器、糖浆沉淀器、糖糊匀和机、丙糖羔匀和机、震槽、泥汁箱、浊汁箱等。在试机前，技工、班长、组长和技术员都曾以认真负责的精神，进行了多次检查，试机进行效果良好：轴承不发热，运转正常，没有杂声。在试机进行中，虽然还有一些小毛病，例如白糖上升机有一些糖斗碰到机身；泥汁箱的摩打架不够坚固，行起机来有些震动等，但由于技工充分发挥劳动热情和创造的积极性，很快便修好了。
    紫坭糖厂是一个较具规模的甘蔗糖厂，每年可产糖三万吨。于一九五二年十月开始施工，今年二月间土建工程全面展开，四月完成了钢架安装，目前尚有一部分设备如能及时到货，预计十二月间开工生产。现在，该厂即将进行的工程有真空泵、结晶箱、蔗汁泵等。其他尚未完成的工程正在加紧进行，争取按期或提前试机。  （青奇、李为）
