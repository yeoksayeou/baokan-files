Two Good Experiences

    Today's People's Daily publishes the experiences of Taigu, Shanxi, and Laiyang, Shandong, in purchasing wheat, which shows that we must grasp and apply a fundamental principle in our rural work: political work must be closely coordinated with economic work. Stalin said: "In practice, politics and economics are inseparable. They exist and function together. Anyone who tries to separate economics from politics in our practical work, to strengthen economic work at the expense of weakening political work, or vice versa, to strengthen political work at the expense of weakening economic work, is bound to fall into an impasse." ("On the shortcomings of Party work and the methods of eliminating Trotskyist double-dealers and other double-dealers") This principle should always be followed in our national construction work.
    What are the basic tasks and basic contents of current rural political work? It is to vigorously publicize the general line and general tasks of our country during the transition period, the road of industrialization and socialism, and the policy of socialist transformation of agriculture during the transition period, that is, to gradually guide agriculture to socialism over a considerable period of time through the development of mutual aid and cooperation, in accordance with the principle of farmers' voluntary participation. All farmers must understand that only by taking the socialist road can agricultural production be developed smoothly, so that all farmers can truly get rid of poverty and become increasingly prosperous. And to transition to socialism, we must first realize the construction of national industrialization, which is the highest interest of all the people and the highest interest of farmers. Because only by realizing socialist industrialization can the state be able to help farmers develop large-scale agriculture with machines, improve agricultural productivity, and provide farmers with abundant and cheap means of livelihood. In order to help the cause of national industrialization, all farmers should launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy, fully supply the state with the commodity grain and other crops it needs to ensure the people's food supply, stabilize prices, and protect economic construction; they should actively cooperate closely with socialist state-owned industry and commerce, and not allow speculative private merchants to use farmers' products to disrupt the market and destroy construction. If we fail to do these tasks well and allow the rural economy to develop freely according to the economic laws of capitalism, the result will be that, in addition to a few speculators and exploiters becoming the bourgeoisie, the vast majority of farmers will fall into a state of poverty being exploited and enslaved, and the entire economic construction will not be carried out smoothly according to the state plan, which is very detrimental to the farmers and all the people.
    Some comrades in the work of grain requisition and purchase have neglected to publicize the general line of the transition period and the future of socialism to the masses, and only carried out ideological mobilization from the perspective of the farmers' individual, local, and immediate small interests. Some comrades even avoid carrying out these propaganda, mistakenly thinking that this will hinder the farmers' enthusiasm for production. This view is obviously wrong. If we do not explain to the farmers the prospects of national development and the future of the farmers, we cannot inspire the enthusiasm of the peasant masses to participate in national construction, but instead make the farmers more interested in their own small calculations. As for the fact that propaganda in some places has not achieved the desired effect, that is because there are errors in the content or method of propaganda: some propagandists have not seriously studied the general direction and general line of national construction and have made deviations in their lectures; or they have not deeply understood the specific situation of the local area and the thoughts of the masses, and the content of the propaganda is empty, the method is rigid, and it is divorced from reality. These should be corrected.
    The propaganda of the general line of the transition period in the countryside should be linked to the farmers' personal experience. Since liberation, the peasant masses have had many personal feelings about the benefits the country has given them. In just a few years, our country has given farmers enormous benefits: agricultural loans, water conservancy construction, the supply of agricultural tools, fertilizers and other means of production and means of livelihood have increased year by year; the price difference between industrial products and agricultural products has narrowed year by year; the Communist Party and the People's Government have also given farmers great help in improving agricultural technology and overcoming natural disasters; more importantly, poor farmers have invariably received land and houses in the land reform; many farmers have established production cooperation and marketing cooperation organizations under the correct leadership of the Communist Party. The inevitable result of all this is that agricultural products increase year by year, and the material and cultural life of farmers improves year by year. However, some farmers, while their lives are gradually improving, cannot see or have forgotten the great changes that the country has brought to their lives, and cannot recognize the better future of the country and themselves. However, as long as we are good at enlightening and guiding, the peasant masses can educate themselves through memories, comparisons, and associations, and can transform great principles into their own thoughts. When the peasant masses more clearly understand that their fate and the fate of the national construction cause are inextricably linked, their patriotic enthusiasm will be even higher, and their enthusiasm to sell grain to the state and pay agricultural taxes can be brought into play. The experience of Li Fengyi Mutual Aid Group members in Laiyang County, Shandong Province, from being unwilling to sell grain to actively selling grain, fully proves this point.
    Of course, political work must also be coordinated with economic work. The economic work in grain purchase mainly includes correctly grasping grain prices, doing a good job in material supply, and strengthening market management. When carrying out this work, state-owned trade and cooperative agencies must closely cooperate and support each other under the unified leadership and arrangement of the local Party committee. In this regard, the grain purchase experience of Taigu County, Shanxi Province, is worth learning from in various places.
    The experience of grain purchase in previous years has proved that the quality of material supply work is the key to whether the grain purchase task can be completed well. Because the main form of economic connection between rural and urban areas in our country is through commodity exchange, the direct purpose of farmers selling grain is to buy the means of production and means of livelihood they need, and "selling for buying" is the general law for working farmers to participate in market activities. We must be good at grasping this law in order to do a good job in grain procurement. Material supply work must be carried out according to the season, meet the needs of the masses, and be planned. Some state-owned commercial departments and cooperative cadres have a simple idea of selling goods, only thinking that the autumn harvest is a good selling opportunity, and regardless of whether farmers need it, they send a large amount of inventory to the countryside in order to "complete the sales task." Some commercial departments and cooperative cadres are also full of enthusiasm to serve the farmers, but their working methods are incorrect, and they subjectively allocate materials, and the result is that they supply what is not needed. In order to change this situation, commercial departments and cooperatives at all levels should conduct in-depth and comprehensive investigations into the quantity and variety of commodities needed by farmers, and carefully study the needs of farmers in different regions, in order to achieve planned supply.
    Another issue that should be paid special attention to in grain work is to resolutely strengthen market management and strictly prohibit the speculation and sabotage of grain merchants. At present, some illegal grain merchants have been found in various places taking advantage of the peak season of grain purchase to engage in illegal activities such as raising prices, lowering prices, intercepting purchases, and rushing to purchase, which has seriously harmed the interests of the state and farmers. Therefore, various measures must be taken to control them to ensure the completion of the grain purchase plan.
    Party and government organs at all levels in various places should strengthen the unified leadership of various financial and economic departments and propaganda departments in a timely and practical manner, strengthen political work and economic work in rural areas, so that all rural work cadres can learn to correctly conduct political education for the peasant masses, correctly carry out economic work in rural areas, and closely combine the two.

### 两个好经验

专栏：经济工作述评

    两个好经验
    今天本报发表的山西太谷、山东莱阳收购小麦的经验，说明我们在农村工作中必须掌握和运用一条根本原则：政治工作与经济工作要密切配合。斯大林说：“在实践中，政治和经济是分不开的。它们两者一同存在，一同起作用。谁想在我们的实际工作中把经济和政治分开，以减弱政治工作为代价来加强经济工作，或者相反地，以减弱经济工作为代价来加强政治工作，那他就一定要陷入绝境。”（“论党工作底缺点和消灭托洛茨基两面分子及其他两面分子的办法”）这个原则，在我们的国家建设工作中是永远应当遵循的。
    当前农村政治工作的基本任务和基本内容是什么呢？这就是向各级干部和全体党员以及所有农民大力宣传我们国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务，宣传工业化和社会主义的道路，宣传过渡时期中对于农业的社会主义改造的方针，即按照农民自愿的原则经过发展互助合作的道路，在一个相当长的时间之内，逐步引导农业过渡到社会主义的方针。要使所有农民都懂得，只有走社会主义的道路，才能顺利地发展农业生产，使所有的农民真正摆脱贫困的境地而日益富裕起来。而要过渡到社会主义，首先就必须实现国家工业化的建设，这是全体人民的最高利益，也是农民的最高利益。因为只有实现社会主义的工业化，才能够使国家有可能用机器来帮助农民发展大规模的农业，以提高农业生产率，并有可能供给农民以丰富的和便宜的生活资料。为了帮助国家工业化的事业，全体农民就应该展开增产节约运动，充分供给国家所需要的商品粮食和其他农作物，以便保证人民的粮食供应，稳定物价，保障经济建设；就应该积极与社会主义的国营工商业密切合作，而不要让投机的私商利用农民的生产品扰乱市场，破坏建设。如果我们不能作好这些工作，而听任农村经济按照资本主义的经济法则自由发展下去，其结果，除了少数投机者和剥削者变为资产阶级之外，绝大多数农民将会陷于被剥削被奴役的贫困地位，而整个经济建设也不能按照国家的计划顺利进行，这是对农民和全体人民十分不利的。
    有些同志在征粮购粮工作中忽略了对群众宣传过渡时期的总路线和社会主义的前途，只是从农民个人的局部的眼前的小利益出发进行思想动员。有的同志甚至回避进行这些宣传，错误地以为这会妨碍农民的生产积极性。这种看法显然是不对的。我们如果不向农民讲清楚国家发展的远景和农民的前途，就不能鼓舞起农民群众参加国家建设的热情，反而使农民只是更津津有味地打个人的小算盘。至于有些地方宣传没有收到应有的效果，那是由于宣传的内容或方式有错误：有的是宣传者对于国家建设的总方针总路线没有认真地学习，讲得出了偏差；或者是对于当地的具体情况和群众的思想没有深入地了解，宣传的内容空洞、方式生硬，脱离实际。这些都是应该改正的。
    在农村中进行过渡时期总路线的宣传，应该和农民切身的经验联系起来。解放以来，农民群众对于国家给自己的好处是有很多亲身的感受的。短短几年间，我们的国家已经给了农民以巨大的利益：农业贷款、水利建设、农具肥料和其他生产资料生活资料的供应年年增加；工业品和农业品之间的差价年年缩小；在提高农业技术和战胜自然灾害等方面，共产党和人民政府也给了农民很大的帮助；更重要的是：贫苦农民无例外地都在土地改革中得到了土地、房屋；许多农民在共产党的正确领导下已经成立了生产合作和供销合作的组织。这一切的必然的结果，是农业产品一年比一年增加，农民的物质和文化生活一年比一年提高。可是，有些农民在生活日渐改善中却看不清或者忘记了国家给他们的生活带来的大变化，认不清国家和自己的更加美好的前途。但是，只要我们善于启发，注意引导，农民群众自己就能够用回忆、对比和联想来教育自己，就能够把大道理化为群众自己的思想。农民群众更清楚地了解到他们的命运和国家建设事业的命运是血肉相连的时候，爱国热情就会更加高涨起来，出售粮食给国家和缴纳农业税的积极性就能发挥出来。山东莱阳县李凤义互助组组员由不愿售粮到踊跃售粮的经验，完全证明了这一点。
    当然，政治工作还必须要和经济工作相配合。购粮中的经济工作，主要的是正确掌握粮食价格，作好物资供应和加强市场管理。进行这项工作时，国营贸易和合作机关，必须在当地党委统一领导布置下，密切配合和互相支援。在这一方面，山西太谷县的购粮经验是值得各地学习的。
    历年购粮的经验，都证明了物资供应工作的好坏是购粮任务能不能很好完成的关键。因为当前我国农村和城市进行经济联系的主要形式是通过商品交换，农民出售粮食的直接目的是为了买进他们所需要的生产资料和生活资料，“为买而卖”是劳动农民参加市场活动的一般规律。我们必须善于掌握这个规律，才能做好粮食收购工作。物资供应工作必须按照季节、适应群众需要、有计划地进行。有些国营商业部门和合作社干部有一种单纯推销货物的想法，只想到秋收后是一个良好的推销时机，不管农民是否需要，就把大量存货送到农村里去，以求“完成推销任务”。有些商业部门和合作社的干部也是满腔热忱为农民服务的，可是工作方法不对，主观主义地调拨物资，结果也是供非所需。为了改变这种状况，各级商业部门和合作社应当深入地全面地进行农民所需商品数量和品种的调查，认真研究不同地区的农民的需要，以求做到有计划的供应。
    在粮食工作中特别应该注意的另一个问题是要坚决加强市场管理，严禁粮食商人的投机捣乱。目前各地已发现一些不法粮商乘着购粮的旺季，进行抬价、压价、拦购、抢购等不法行为，这对国家和农民的利益，都有严重损害。因此，必须采取各种办法加以管制，保证粮食收购计划的完成。
    各地各级党政机关，应当及时地切实地加强对各个财经部门和宣传部门的统一领导，加强农村的政治工作和经济工作，使所有农村工作干部学会正确地对农民群众进行政治教育，正确地在农村进行经济工作，并且把两者密切地结合起来。
