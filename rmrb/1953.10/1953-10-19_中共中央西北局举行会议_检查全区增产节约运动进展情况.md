Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, October 18th: The Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a meeting on October 16th to review the progress of the increase production and practice economy movement in the region. Of the four key capital construction projects in the Northwest this year—coal, electricity, textiles, and oil drilling—by the end of September, except for coal mine drilling progress, which only completed 39 percent of the annual plan, electricity had completed 73 percent of the annual plan, textiles 74 percent, and oil drilling 65 percent. In September, the nine drilling teams distributed across seven oil drilling areas all set high records for their respective teams.

The key electricity construction project—the No. 1 new generator at the Xi'an No. 2 Power Plant and the No. 3 new generator at the Lanzhou Power Plant—began operating in the first ten days of this month. The key textile construction project, the state-owned Northwest No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill, also simultaneously put 30,000 spindles and nearly 1,000 looms into production.

State-owned industrial enterprises in major production sectors such as coal, electricity generation, crude oil, gasoline, kerosene, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth have all greatly exceeded their monthly product plans for September. By the end of September, these enterprises had nearly completed or exceeded three-quarters of their annual product plans. Among them, the annual increase production and practice economy plans for items like kerosene and cotton cloth are nearing completion. Electricity and oil drilling units, after mobilizing the masses of workers to rationally organize production, have found that they have too many personnel and have requested that higher-level authorities make unified allocations. Textile and other departments nearing completion of their annual increase production and practice economy tasks are studying the possibility of adding production tasks to produce even more wealth for the country.

Workers in the local industrial system have also achieved great success in tapping potential.

During this period, farmers have been working intensively on autumn harvest and autumn planting. Currently, except for a few late-autumn crops, the autumn harvests in most areas have been completed. The total output for the region is expected to increase slightly compared to last year. Among them, Shaanxi, following a bumper wheat harvest this summer, has seen its autumn grain output increase by another 10 percent compared to last year. Grain output in Gansu and Ningxia is close to last year's levels. The people of all nationalities in Qinghai, after overcoming severe natural disasters, have achieved an autumn grain harvest slightly lower than last year's. Xinjiang is expected to increase its harvest by 10 to 15 percent compared to last year. The average yield of ginned cotton in the cotton-growing areas of Shaanxi is 40 jin per mu, an increase of 25 percent compared to last year. Autumn planting (winter wheat sowing) has been completed in all areas except for parts of central Shaanxi and Gansu. Farmers in many areas have set targets for increasing yields per unit area. Farmers in Xingping County plan to establish 82,000 mu of high-yield land, striving to achieve a grain yield of 304 jin per mu.

Herdsmen in various areas are actively cutting and storing grass in preparation for wintering their livestock. By the end of September, herdsmen in Suzi Township, Xunhua County, Qinghai, had stored 950,000 jin of grass.

Financial, tax, banking, commercial, cooperative, grain, and transportation departments, which serve the tasks of increasing production and practicing economy in industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, have also taken active steps under the leadership of local Party committees and governments. Financial departments have strengthened the review and supervision of expenditures. Tax departments have strengthened the inspection of peak-season collection and the final settlement of income taxes. Banks have vigorously expanded savings and recovered loans to provide funds for the market. Commercial departments have launched competitions among employees to strive to complete purchasing, sales, and remittance tasks. Cooperatives in many areas have also begun to attach importance to the purchase of grain and cotton and the reserve and supply of means of production. Grain departments have begun to conduct purchases and supplies in certain areas in a planned manner. Many transport workers have also launched increase production and practice economy competitions.

After summarizing the above achievements, the meeting emphasized that the progress of the increase production and practice economy movement in the region is uneven, and there are still many shortcomings. Industrial production is better, but capital construction is worse. Some production units do not mobilize the masses and only emphasize objective difficulties. Many capital construction units show insufficient enthusiasm and are currently only at the stage of making appeals. In the work in agricultural and pastoral areas, the work of material supply and other aspects has not been effectively coordinated, and the progress of highway transportation departments is very slow. In order to further deepen the increase production and practice economy movement, the meeting pointed out that the first thing is to fully mobilize the masses and take the increase production and practice economy plan to the masses for discussion. Secondly, the work in all aspects should be carried out in a coordinated and linked manner. If one link is not working, it will definitely affect the operation of the entire chain. At present, it is necessary to change the backward state of transportation. Thirdly, all Party organizations, down to the branch level, must assist administrative organizations in studying and discussing the increase production and practice economy issues in their respective units so that every Communist Party member can be educated by this.

The meeting finally emphasized that as winter will soon begin, the work of capital construction departments must be particularly stepped up. In particular, the three key capital construction tasks of coal, electricity, and oil drilling must take effective measures to strive to complete and overfulfill the tasks on schedule.

    中共中央西北局举行会议
    检查全区增产节约运动进展情况
    【新华社西安十八日电】中共中央西北局在十月十六日开会检查全区增产节约运动的进展情况。西北今年基本建设中的四大重点——煤、电、纺织和石油钻探，到九月底止，除煤矿钻探进度只完成年度计划的百分之三十九外，电已完成年度计划的百分之七十三，纺织完成百分之七十四，石油钻探完成了百分之六十五。在九月份内，分布在七个石油钻区的九个钻井队都创造了各队的高额纪录。
    电的建设重点——西安第二发电厂一号新机和兰州电厂第三部新机已在本月上旬开始运转，纺织建设重点国营西北第二棉纺织厂也有三万纱锭和近千台布机同时转入生产。
    国营工业中的煤、发电、原油、汽油、煤油、棉纱、棉布等主要生产企业，都大大地超额完成了九月份月度产品计划。到九月底止，这些企业都已接近完成和超额完成年度产品计划的四分之三，其中煤油、棉布等项的全年增产节约计划已接近完成。电业、石油钻探等单位在发动职工群众合理组织生产后，已感到人员过多，提请上级机关统一调配。接近完成全年增产节约计划任务的纺织等部门正在研究追加生产任务，为国家增产更多财富。
    地方工业系统的职工在挖掘潜力方面也得到很大成就。
    农民在这一阶段中紧张地进行了秋收和秋播工作。目前除少数晚秋外，大部地区的秋禾都已收割完毕。全区总产量比去年可略有增产。其中陕西继今夏小麦丰收之后，秋粮产量又较去年增产一成；甘肃、宁夏秋粮产量接近去年水平；战胜严重自然灾害的青海各族人民，取得了略低于去年的秋粮收成；新疆可较去年增收一成到一成半。陕西棉区平均每亩可产皮棉四十市斤，较去年增收两成半。各地的秋播（冬麦播种）工作，除陕中、甘肃部分地区外，都已播种完毕。许多地区的农民订出了提高单位面积产量计划，兴平县农民计划建立大面积丰产地八万二千亩，每亩产量争取收粮三百零四斤。
    各地牧民现正积极打草储草，以备牲畜过冬。青海循化县苏自乡牧民到九月底已储草九十五万斤。
    为工、农、牧业增产节约任务服务的财政、税务、金融、商业、合作、粮食、交通运输等部门，在各地党和政府的领导下，也都已积极行动起来。财政部门加强了对支出的审核监督。税务部门加强了检查旺季征收和所得税的汇算清缴工作。银行大力展开储蓄、收回贷款以供市场用款。商业部门已发动职工开展竞赛，争取完成购销和上缴任务。许多地区的合作社也都开始重视收购粮、棉和对于生产资料的储备和供应。粮食部门已开始有计划地在某些地区进行收购和供应。许多运输工人也展开了增产节约竞赛。
    会议总结了上述成绩后，着重指出：全区增产节约运动的进展是不平衡的，还存在着不少缺点，工业生产好些，基本建设差些；部分生产单位不发动群众，只强调客观困难；许多基本建设单位表现劲头不足，目前还只停留在号召阶段。农牧地区工作中，物资供应等方面的工作还没有进行有效的配合，公路运输部门的进度则很迟缓。为了更深入一步开展增产节约运动，会议指出：首先是要充分发动群众，把增产节约计划拿到群众中去进行讨论。其次，各方面的工作应该有联系、有配合地去进行，一个环节不灵，就一定会影响到整个链条的运转。目前必须改变交通运输方面的落后状态。再次，党的各个组织直到支部，都必须协助行政组织，研究和讨论本单位的增产节约问题，使每个共产党员都由此受到教育。
    会议最后着重指出：时间不久即转入冬季，基本建设部门的工作必须特别加紧进行，特别是煤、电和石油钻探三项基本建设任务，必须采取有效措施，争取如期完成和超额完成任务。
