Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 23rd. The Korean-Chinese side's explanation work to prisoners of war was still unable to proceed on the 23rd. Due to obstruction by U.S. special agents, the explanation work has been halted for five consecutive days.

On the 23rd, six of our captured personnel were repatriated. This included three captured personnel from the Korean People's Army and three captured personnel from the Chinese People's Volunteers. Among these six returnees, apart from one captured volunteer who was detained in the explanation tent for three hours on the 17th due to U.S. obstruction and was not repatriated, the remaining five were repatriated after scaling the wire fences of the camp and escaping the control of U.S. special agents.

    我方解释工作因美方特务阻挠已停顿五天
    【新华社开城二十三日电】朝中方面对战俘的解释工作二十三日仍未能进行。由于美方特务的阻挠，解释工作陷于停顿已连续五天之久。
    二十三日有六名我方被俘人员遣返归来。其中包括三名朝鲜人民军被俘人员和三名志愿军被俘人员。这六名归来人员中，除十七日在解释帐篷中由于美方阻挠而停留三小时未获遣返的一名志愿军被俘人员以外，其余五人都是翻越营场的铁丝网逃出美方特务的控制而被遣返归来的。
