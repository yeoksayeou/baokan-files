    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 13th: TASS reports that the German News Agency broadcasted a summary of the report by Max Reimann, Chairman of the German Communist Party, at the Eleventh Plenary Session of the German Communist Party Central Committee held in Dusseldorf earlier this month.
    The report discussed the lessons learned from the Bundestag elections and the problems faced by the German Communist Party in the struggle for peace, unity, and democracy.
    Max Reimann said: The reason Adenauer won the election is because he and the imperialist groups backing him used despicable means to cover up their militaristic and anti-national plans, and deceived the voters. All reactionary, militaristic, and revanchist forces supported by the American imperialists are united around Adenauer.
    Reimann pointed out: The election result is a lesson for all democratic, peace-loving, and patriotic people in West Germany. The lesson is that victory can only be achieved if all those who oppose Adenauer, all those who strive for peace and the peaceful reunification of Germany on a democratic basis, form a united front.
    Max Reimann refuted the deceptive propaganda spread by the imperialists, who insisted that the election results proved that the majority of West German people supported Adenauer's militaristic policies, and pointed out that in fact, nine million voters—mainly the working class—expressed their opposition to Adenauer's war policies in the election.
    He pointed out that the main task of the West German working class and all peace-loving and democratically-minded people is to prevent the realization of the Bonn and Paris military treaties and to stop Adenauer from implementing policies that deepen the division of Germany.
    Reimann pointed out that only the signing of a peace treaty can free West Germany's economy from dependence on the United States, because the treaty will eliminate all obstacles to the development of peaceful industries and will lead to the expansion of trade with all countries on an equal footing.
    Reimann emphasized that it is necessary to establish united action of the working class, first and foremost the united action of Social Democrats and Communists.

    德共中央委员会举行第十一次全体大会
    雷曼号召西德人民击败阿登纳卖国政策
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林十二日讯：德意志通讯社播发了德国共产党主席马克斯·雷曼于本月初在杜塞尔多夫举行的德国共产党中央委员会第十一次全体大会上的报告摘要。
    报告谈到自联邦议院选举中得到的教训，以及德国共产党在争取和平、统一与民主的斗争中所面临的问题。
    马克斯·雷曼说：阿登纳在选举中得到胜利的原因，是由于他以及为他撑腰的帝国主义集团用卑鄙手段掩盖住他们的军国主义的、反民族的计划，欺骗了选民。美帝国主义者所支持的一切反动的军国主义以及复仇主义势力都团结在阿登纳的周围。
    雷曼指出：选举结果是对西德所有民主的、爱好和平的和具有爱国思想的人民的一个教训，这个教训就是：只有所有反对阿登纳的人、所有争取和平与在民主基础上和平统一德国的人组成联合阵线，才能获得胜利。
    马克斯·雷曼驳斥了帝国主义所散布的硬说选举结果证明大多数西德人民拥护阿登纳的军国主义政策的欺骗宣传，并指出：事实上有九百万选民——主要是工人阶级——在选举中表示了反对阿登纳的战争政策。
    他指出：西德工人阶级与全体爱好和平和具有民主思想的人民的主要任务是，不让波恩与巴黎军事条约实现，并阻止阿登纳实行这种加深德国分裂的政策。
    雷曼指出：只有签订和约，才能使西德经济不再依靠美国，因为和约将消除和平工业发展的一切障碍，并且将导致在平等的基础上扩大与各国的贸易。
    雷曼强调指出：必须建立工人阶级的一致行动，首先是社会民主党人和共产党人的一致行动。
