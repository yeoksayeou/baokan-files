    My Preliminary Experiences as a Theory Instructor
    Song Hanmin

    When I first took on the role of theory instructor, I was initially somewhat timid. However, with the strong support of the Party committee and administrative leadership, my confidence has grown over the past two months. I deeply feel that being a theory instructor for "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" is a glorious task assigned to me by the Party. At the same time, I realize that because my theoretical level is not high enough, this work is also difficult, and I must be conscientious and learn humbly from my work, accumulating experience to improve the quality of teaching.

    The following are my preliminary experiences in teaching:

    (1) It is necessary to carefully prepare the lecture outline, and to seek opinions and revise repeatedly without fearing the complexity and difficulty.

    In late August, under the leadership of the Party committee, I began to draft an outline for the introduction to Chapter Nine of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)." I spent half a month writing the introduction to the lecture, and listened to the opinions of leaders and comrades, making four revisions in total. The items for which opinions were sought included whether the content was correct, whether the central theme was prominent, whether the arguments were clear, whether the explanation was sufficient, and whether the logic was clear. I believe that only through such revisions can the quality of the lecture be improved. In addition, this revision work is also of great benefit to me; each revision improves my theoretical level.

    (2) The content of the outline should be enriched step by step, from simple to complex. My drafting procedure is roughly as follows: First, based on the necessary materials, draft the paragraphs and outlines of the issues to be discussed, and write subheadings as the "backbone" of the lecture; second, according to the requirements of each subheading, collect relevant documents and materials (in addition to the learning documents stipulated by the central government, this also includes relevant special articles in newspapers and magazines, study notes, etc.), record their page numbers and paragraphs as a material index for writing the draft, and annotate them after each subheading. In this way, the complete engineering blueprint of the lecture has been formed, the materials are roughly complete, and I have a clear understanding; the third step is to determine the above draft through review and discussion by relevant parties; the fourth step is to start writing the lecture, and according to the index, find all the chapters and paragraphs related to a certain sub-issue, read, consider, compare, and determine how to compile, which proposition to use as the basis, which materials to add, which original texts to cite, etc. Finally, write the first draft of this sub-issue. After writing each topic in this way, enter the process of repeated review, discussion, revision, examination, trial lecture, and finalization. It should be pointed out that writing the first draft is very important in the entire writing process. My preliminary experience is that if you compile according to the above steps, it will be relatively complete.

    (3) The principle of "less but refined" must be grasped. The writing and lecturing must be aimed at the general level of the students, and strive for prominent central themes, clear concepts, clear levels, and systematic content. This requires a thorough understanding of the central theme of the lecture content. If you cannot grasp the essence of the problem, then no matter how much you quote and how much you strain your lips and tongue, you will not be able to explain it clearly, and you will not be able to make the students feel that the "problem is solved." I once tried to write about the necessity of the transition period, and wrote for three or four days, but the logic of the writing was still very confusing. After being enlightened by the leaders, I realized that although my lecture quoted many words from Lenin and Stalin, it did not grasp the essence of the problem. Therefore, I feel that it is not appropriate to deal with too many problems at once, but to concentrate on understanding a few major problems.

    (4) Before lecturing, the student committee should be used to collect questions from students during previewing. In addition, you should often read the blackboards, wall newspapers, and small newspapers of various units, and often "chat" with the comrades around you about the experiences, insights, and difficult problems in learning, as a reference for lecturing. Such an approach can be combined with reality, and the effect will be much better than teaching without a concrete understanding of the lecture object, aimlessly, and generally. This time, when I lectured on the New Economic Policy, I learned a lot of problems from below in advance, such as: "Does the implementation of the New Economic Policy mean that the October Revolution was also a bourgeois democratic revolution?" "Since it is the dictatorship of the proletariat, why is there still the question of 'who will defeat whom'?" For example, when preparing to talk about commerce recently, a group raised the question: "Is the Soviet Union's expulsion of private capital from commerce at that time different from the 'each gets what they deserve' in our Common Program?" These questions are enlightening to me in writing the lecture. Understanding the difficult problems of the students at any time, and paying attention to them in preparing and lecturing, can achieve a targeted approach and improve the teaching effect.

    (5) Theory instructors should study the methods of lecturing. I believe that lectures should be stable, and important places should be clearly stated word by word, and even repeated once or twice; the cited materials should preferably indicate which book and article and how many pages they are excerpted from, in order to help comrades further check the original text and increase their interest in in-depth study. From my experience, when reading many special articles, further checking the original text will reveal many arguments that are more suitable for your own selection, and make the study more in-depth. Secondly, in order to make it easier for students to accept, the method of dividing into sections and sections can be appropriately adopted during lectures to make the explanation levels clearer, but it is necessary to prevent "A, B, C, D, opening a Chinese medicine shop." Speaking too fast or unclear speech will greatly damage the teaching effect. Too fast will make it difficult for people to take notes, find the key points, and especially leave no room for ideological maneuvering; unclear pronunciation will make it difficult for students to hear clearly. Experience has proved that after unified lesson preparation and unified lecture outlines, the same lecture can also achieve different results, and the main reason lies in the explanation method.

    In general, being a theory instructor is a glorious and arduous task. With the strong support of the Party and administrative leadership, as long as we are willing to be elementary school students, humbly listen to opinions, and carefully study the lectures, we can complete this task. I have deeply realized this from the learning and exploration of the past two or three months.

    我担任理论教员的初步经验
    宋寒民
    我担任理论教员之初，本来是有些胆怯的，可是在党委和行政领导的大力帮助下，两个月来已提高了信心。我深感到担任“联共（布）党史”理论教员，是党交给我的光荣任务。同时我感到由于我的理论水平不够高，这个工作又艰难，必须兢兢业业，百倍虚心地从工作中学习，积累经验，以提高教学质量。
    下面是我在教学工作中的初步体会：
    （一）必须认真拟好讲课提纲，不怕繁难地征求意见，反复修改。
    八月下旬，在党委的领导下，我开始起草“联共（布）党史”第九章学习引言的提纲。我以半个月时间来写引言的讲稿，并听取领导上和同志们的意见，前后作了四次修改。征求意见的项目，包括内容是否正确，中心是否突出，论点是否明确，阐释是否充分，逻辑是否清楚等等。我认为只有经过这样的修改，才能提高讲稿的质量。此外，这种修改工作对我也有很大好处，每一次的修改，都使我的理论水平有所提高。
    （二）要按步就班、由简入繁地充实提纲内容。我的撰稿程序大致是这样的：首先，根据必要的资料，将要讲的问题拟出段落和纲目，写出小标题作为讲稿的“龙骨”；其次，按照每一个小标题的要求，搜集有关的文件资料（除中央规定的学习文件外，还包括报纸、杂志上的有关专题论文、学习笔记等），记下它们的页数和段落，作为写稿的资料索引，批注在每个小标题之后，这样，全部讲稿的工程蓝图已经构成，材料也大致齐备，心中也有数了；第三步，经过有关方面审查、讨论来确定以上草案；第四步，着手撰写讲稿，按照索引翻出所有有关某一小问题的章节段落来，对照阅读、考虑、比较，确定如何编写，以那个命题为基础，补入那些材料，引证那些原文等等最后写出这一小题的初稿，这样逐题写完后就进入反复核阅、讨论、修改、审查、试讲及最后定稿的过程。应该指出，编写初稿在全部写稿过程中是很重要的。我的初步经验是，如果按照上述的步骤来编写，是会比较完备的。
    （三）必须掌握少而精的原则。撰稿和讲课一定要针对着学员的一般水平，力求中心突出、概念明确、层次清晰、内容有系统。这就必须使自己对讲课内容中心有透澈的了解。如果抓不住问题的实质，那么尽管旁征博引，唇敝舌焦，也不能讲得很清楚，不能使学员感到“解决问题”。我曾经试写了一次过渡时期必要性的问题，写了三四天，文字的逻辑仍很混乱。得到领导上的启示后，才发现我的讲稿虽然引用了许多列宁、斯大林的话，但没有抓住问题的本质。所以我觉得问题不宜一次搞得太多，而要集中力量搞通几个主要问题。
    （四）讲课之前要通过学委会搜集学员在预习中的问题，此外要常看各单位的黑板报、壁报和小报，要常和周围的同志“聊一聊”学习中的心得、体会和疑难问题，作为讲课的参考。这样的做法，就能结合实际，较之对于讲课对象没有具体了解、无的放矢、泛泛而谈的教课，效果就要好得多了。这次在我讲新经济政策问题时，事先从下面了解到很多问题，例如：“实行新经济政策是否说明十月革命也是资产阶级性质的民主革命？”“既然是无产阶级专政，何以还会有‘谁战胜谁’的问题？”又如在最近准备讲商业问题时，一个小组中提出这样的问题：“苏联当时从商业中排挤私人资本，是否与我国共同纲领中‘各得其所’不相同？”这些问题对我撰写讲稿是有启发的。随时了解学员的疑难问题，并在备课和讲课中加以注意，就能做到有的放矢，提高教学效果。
    （五）理论教员应该研究讲课的方法。我认为讲课要力求平稳，重要的地方尤其应一字一句说清楚，甚至可反复一二次；引证的材料最好说明摘自何书何文多少页，以便帮助同志们进一步查对原文并提高深入学习的兴趣。以我的经验说：在阅读许多专题论文时，进一步查对原文，就会发现许多更适合于自己选用的论据，并使学习更深入些了。其次，为使学员便于接受，在讲课时可适当采用分段分节的办法，使讲解层次更清楚些，但必须防止“甲乙丙丁，开中药铺”。发言过快或说话不清楚都会大大损害教学效果。过快会使人记不下笔记、找不到重点，特别是思想上没有回旋的余地；发音不清楚则会使学员听不清。经验证明，经过统一备课，统一讲课提纲后，同一讲稿也能得到不同的效果，其原因主要就在讲解方法上。
    总的说来，担任理论教员是一个光荣而艰巨的任务。在党与行政领导上的大力支持下，我们只要肯当小学生，虚心地听取意见，细致地钻研讲稿，是能够完成这个任务的。我从这两三个月来的学习与摸索中，深刻地体会到这一点。
