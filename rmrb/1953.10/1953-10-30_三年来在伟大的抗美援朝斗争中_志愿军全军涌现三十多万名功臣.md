Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: In the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the commanders, fighters, and staff of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army displayed a high degree of patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism. In the past three years, in various battles and tasks, a large number of heroes, models, meritorious servicemen, and many collective units with meritorious service have emerged. According to statistics from October 25, 1950, to August of this year, more than 300,000 meritorious servicemen above the third-class merit level and more than 6,100 units with collective third-class merit or above have emerged in the entire army. This includes 217 special-class meritorious servicemen, 154 first-class meritorious servicemen, and 16 units with collective special-class merit. Additionally, 282 meritorious servicemen have been awarded the glorious title of hero or model.

Among the more than 300,000 heroes, models, and meritorious servicemen, 231,190 have been awarded various orders and medals by the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Among them, eight heroes—Yang Gensi, Huang Jiguang, Wu Xianhua, Qiu Shaoyun, Sun Zhanyuan, Yang Lian'di, Yang Chunzeng, and Hu Xiudao—were awarded the honorary title of "Republic Hero" by the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, along with a first-class National Flag Order and a Gold Star Medal each.

Among the sixteen units that were awarded collective special-class merit, there is the 5th Company of the 2nd Battalion of a certain unit, which captured Dongnanshan, a stronghold of Guangtianli, in the Guangtianli battle of the Fourth Campaign, and held the position, blocking the enemy's escape route. It repeatedly charged and killed a large number of enemies, playing a significant role in striking the 8th Division of the Li Pseudo Army. There is also the 8th Company of a certain unit, which completely annihilated more than 240 enemy troops at the cost of very few casualties in the battle to counterattack Height 597.9 in the Shangganling Campaign, and then repelled the group charge of four enemy battalions with two platoons, and later persisted in fighting in the tunnel for fourteen days and nights, eliminating a total of more than 1,760 enemy troops, and finally won a complete victory in the counterattack in coordination with fraternal units. There is the 1st Company of a certain unit, which defended Height 938.2 for five days and four nights in the battle to smash the enemy's "Autumn Offensive" in 1951, eliminating more than 1,800 enemy troops. There is the 9th Squad of the 5th Company of a certain unit, which killed and wounded more than 540 enemy troops at the cost of very few casualties in a certain battle, and the 8th Squad of the 7th Company of a certain unit, which killed and wounded more than 230 enemy troops and captured a large amount of materials in one day and night. There is also Tank No. 215 of a certain unit, which destroyed five enemy tanks, one vehicle, and nine small cannons, damaged one enemy tank, and destroyed twenty-six enemy bunkers, eight machine-gun nests, and command posts and tunnels each in various battles.

In countless victorious battles and various tasks, the heroes, models, and meritorious servicemen, with their exemplary actions, led their comrades to charge and fight, defend tenaciously, and work selflessly, playing a significant role in the battles and tasks to win victory. Special-Class Hero and Company Commander Yang Gensi, in the battle to defend Height 1071 on the outskirts of Xiajieyuli, led the comrades of the 3rd Platoon to bravely smash the enemy's nine charges with the coordination of aircraft and artillery. When the ammunition ran out, he bravely picked up the explosives and blew up dozens of enemies who had rushed up, sacrificing himself gloriously and consolidating the position. In the glorious Shangganling Campaign, Special-Class Hero Huang Jiguang blocked the enemy's machine-gun fire with his chest in order to eliminate the enemy's firing point on the assault road, covering the troops to successfully rush to the main peak and completely annihilate the defending enemy. The victory of the famous Longyuanli battle was won by First-Class Hero Guo Zhongtian and his comrades. They blocked a large number of retreating enemies with one platoon, smashed three fierce attacks by enemy battalions in one day, eliminated more than 200 enemy troops, and persisted until our follow-up troops arrived, annihilating the enemy in one fell swoop. In November last year, in the battle to defend Height 597.9 on the front line of Shangganling, First-Class Combat Hero Hu Xiudao, in close coordination with our artillery, repelled forty-one large and small attacks by the enemy alone, eliminating more than 280 enemy troops and ensuring the safety of the position.

There are also many outstanding heroic figures in the powerful artillery and tank units. Second-Class Hero Liu Si of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit insisted on directing an anti-aircraft gun to shoot down an enemy plane despite suffering a serious head injury in the Huangjiangqiao battle in 1951. In more than two years, the anti-aircraft gun he commanded shot down fourteen enemy planes and damaged twenty-four enemy planes. In the Shangganling battle, Special-Class Meritorious Serviceman and Heroic Gunner Zhang Ruichen, 19, took on the work of several gunners alone and persisted in the shooting task for two days and two nights, cooperating with the infantry to kill many counterattacking enemies and destroy enemy tanks and artillery groups.

The courageous and hardworking engineers also made great contributions to the victory of the war. Many heroic figures like Zhang Zhenzhi and Zhu Chongyuan led their comrades to lay mines under the enemy's "nose," build bridges across frozen rivers at minus 30 degrees, and repair roads destroyed by enemy planes, so that infantry, artillery, tanks, and transport vehicles could continuously advance to the front line.

In the Volunteer Army's reconnaissance units, there are heroes like Cai Jintong. On the medical front, there are models like Liu Xiuzhen. On the railway transport front, there are outstanding locomotive crews like Wang Yu and Li Guoheng.

The immortal deeds of Luo Shengjiao, Wang Yongwei, Lü Yujiu, Zhang Minglu, and others who risked their lives to rescue the Korean people are the glorious banner of the great internationalist spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

In addition, many heroes have emerged in the young Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force. They have achieved great victories in the fight against American air bandits.

On the logistics front, the role of heroes, models, and meritorious servicemen is also extremely significant. They contributed their greatest strength to the unbreakable and indestructible steel transportation line. Special-Class Meritorious Serviceman Yin Jifa not only excellently completed each transportation task under the bombing and strafing of enemy planes but also was the first to create a record of more than 40,000 kilometers of safe driving. Subsequently, Special-Class Meritorious Serviceman Zhang Zhaoyi created a record of 57,000 kilometers of safe driving. Now, truck driver Liu Jingbo has created a record of more than 71,000 kilometers of safe driving, and his truck is still maintained like new.

Among the heroes, models, and meritorious servicemen, some have contributed their precious lives for the motherland and for peace. Their heroic names will be immortal.

    三年来在伟大的抗美援朝斗争中
    志愿军全军涌现三十多万名功臣
    据新华社平壤讯：在伟大的抗美援朝斗争中，中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员和工作人员高度地发挥了爱国主义、国际主义和革命英雄主义精神，三年来在历次战斗和各项工作中，涌现了大批英雄、模范、功臣和许多集体立功单位。据从一九五零年十月二十五日到今年八月止统计，全军涌现了三等功以上的功臣三十多万名，立集体三等功以上的单位六千一百多个。其中包括二百十七名特等功臣、一百五十四名一等功臣和十六个立集体特等功的单位，并有二百八十二名功臣获得了英雄或模范的光荣称号。
    在三十多万名英雄、模范和功臣中，有二十三万一千一百九十人获得了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会颁发的各种勋章和奖章。其中，杨根思、黄继光、伍先华、邱少云、孙占元、杨连第、杨春增、胡修道八位英雄获得了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会授予的“共和国英雄”的光荣称号和一级国旗勋章、金星奖章各一枚。
    在十六个荣立集体特等功的单位中，有在第四次战役广田里战斗中攻克广田里屏障东南山，并坚守阵地，扼住敌人逃路，最后向数倍于己的敌人反复冲杀，大量杀伤了敌人，对打击李伪军第八师的战斗起了重大作用的某部第二营第五连；有在上甘岭战役反击五九七点九高地的战斗中，以极小伤亡代价全歼守敌二百四十余名，又以两个班的兵力击退敌人四个营的集团冲锋，后来又在坑道中坚持战斗十四昼夜，共歼灭敌人一千七百六十多名，最后又在配合兄弟部队反击中获得全胜的某部第八连；有在一九五一年粉碎敌人“秋季攻势”的战斗中，坚守九三八点二高地五天四夜，歼灭敌人一千八百多名的某部第一连；有在某次战斗中以极小伤亡的代价杀伤敌人五百四十多名的某部第五连第九班和在一昼夜中杀伤敌人二百三十多名并缴获大量物资的某部第七连第八班；有在历次战斗中共击毁敌坦克五辆、汽车一辆、小炮九门、击伤敌坦克一辆、摧毁敌人地堡二十六个、机枪巢八个、指挥所、坑道各一个的某部第二一五号坦克。
    英雄、模范和功臣们，在无数次胜利的战斗和各项工作中，以自己的模范行动，带领着战友们冲锋陷阵、顽强守备和忘我地工作，在争取胜利的战斗和工作中，起了很大的作用。特级英雄、杨根思连长在守备下碣隅里外围的一零七一高地的战斗中，率领第三排的战友们英勇粉碎了敌人在飞机、大炮配合下的九次冲锋，最后到弹药打完时，他勇敢地抱起了炸药包，炸死了冲上来的数十名敌人，自己光荣牺牲，巩固了阵地。在光辉的上甘岭战役中，特级英雄黄继光为了消灭冲锋道路上的敌人火力点，以胸膛堵住了敌人的机枪口，掩护部队顺利地冲上主峰，全歼守敌。著名的龙源里战斗的胜利，是一级英雄郭忠田和他的战友们打出来的。他们以一个排的兵力，堵住了大批溃退的敌人，一天中粉碎了敌人成营兵力的三次猛攻，歼灭敌人二百多名，一直坚持到我军后续部队赶来，聚歼了敌人。去年十一月在坚守上甘岭前线的五九七点九高地的战斗中，一级战斗英雄胡修道在我炮兵的密切配合下，一个人打退了敌人大大小小四十一次进攻，歼敌二百八十多人，保证了阵地的安全。
    在强大的炮兵部队和坦克部队中，也有许多杰出的英雄人物。高射炮某部二级英雄刘四，在一九五一年黄江桥战斗中头部负重伤，仍坚持指挥一门高射炮击落了一架敌机。在二年多时间中，他指挥的一门高射炮，就击落了十四架敌机，击伤二十四架敌机。在上甘岭战斗中，特等功臣、十九岁的英雄炮手张瑞臣，一个人担负几个炮手的工作，坚持了两天两夜的射击任务，配合步兵，打死了很多反扑的敌人，打毁了敌人的坦克和炮群。
    英勇而勤劳的工兵对战争的胜利也作了巨大的贡献。许多像张振智、朱重元的英雄人物，带领着战友们在敌人的“鼻子”底下埋设地雷，在零下三十度的冰河里架设桥梁，把敌机炸毁的公路再修起来，使步兵、大炮、坦克和运输汽车源源开赴前线。
    在志愿军的侦察部队里有着蔡金同这样的英雄。在医务战线上，有着刘秀珍这样的模范，在铁路运输战线上有着王禹、李国珩这样出色的机车组。
    罗盛教、王永维、吕玉久、张明禄等舍身抢救朝鲜人民的不朽事迹，是中国人民志愿军伟大国际主义精神的光辉的旗帜。
    此外，年青的中国人民志愿军空军部队中也出现了许多英雄。他们在打击美国空中强盗的战斗中，取得了很大的胜利。
    在后勤战线上，英雄、模范和功臣们所起的作用也是十分巨大的。他们在打不断炸不烂的钢铁运输线上贡献了自己最大的力量。特等功臣尹继发在敌机的轰炸扫射下，不但出色地完成了历次的运输任务，而且最先创造了安全行车四万多公里的纪录。接着，特等功臣张昭义又创造了安全行车五万七千公里的纪录。现在汽车司机刘静波已经创造了安全行车七万一千多公里的纪录，他的车子还保养得像新的一样。
    在英雄、模范和功臣中，有的已为祖国为和平贡献出了他们宝贵的生命。他们的英名将永垂不朽。
