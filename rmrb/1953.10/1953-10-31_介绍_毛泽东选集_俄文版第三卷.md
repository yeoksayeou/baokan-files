    Introduction to the Russian Edition of "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung," Volume III
    By A. Aleksandrov, Soviet Union
    The Foreign Languages Publishing House recently published the Russian translation of Volume III of "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung," translated from Chinese. This volume contains Comrade Mao Tse-tung's essays, speeches, and other works from May 1939 to May 1941.

    Comrade Mao Tse-tung's works, such as "The Current Situation and the Tasks of the Party," "Overcome the Danger of Capitulation and Strive for a Turn for the Better in the Situation," "Unite All Anti-Japanese Forces, Oppose the Anti-Communist Die-hards," and "The Situation After Repulsing the Second Anti-Communist Onslaught," clarify the domestic political situation in China at that time. The following main facts illustrate the characteristics of this political situation.

    Japanese aggressors drove deep into China, occupying vast territories, including important cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Changsha. However, the Japanese offensive power had been greatly depleted by the resistance of the Chinese people. Behind enemy lines, under the initiative and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, countless solid guerrilla base areas were established. The People's Revolutionary Army, such as the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, relied on these base areas to victoriously launch an armed struggle against Japan. Therefore, the Japanese gradually stopped their attacks on the Kuomintang army and used their main force to deal with the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. At the same time, Japanese imperialists launched a "political offensive" against the Kuomintang, attempting to force them to surrender.

    A portion of the comprador bourgeoisie, landlords, and Kuomintang bureaucrats, headed by the traitor Wang Jingwei, openly embraced Japanese imperialism, signed traitorous treaties with the Japanese, and turned vast areas of Chinese territory into Japanese colonies.

    Another part of the comprador bourgeoisie, landlords, and Kuomintang bureaucrats, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, the so-called die-hards, though ostensibly remaining in the anti-Japanese national united front, were in fact engaged in activities to undermine and split the united front, pursuing an anti-communist and anti-people policy.

    On June 12, 1939, Kuomintang elements in Pingjiang shot and killed Tu Zhengkun, Luo Ziming, and other patriotic people who actively resisted Japan from the New Fourth Army Liaison Office. Reactionaries and capitulationists regarded this massacre as a signal to provoke armed conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in order to realize their conspiracy to split the united front and resume the civil war. In January 1941, the Southern Anhui Incident, an attack on the headquarters of the New Fourth Army, occurred.

    Chiang Kai-shek began to blockade the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the central base area of the Eighth Route Army. According to his instructions, Kuomintang troops launched military provocations against the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army in various regions.

    Under these circumstances, the main task of the Chinese Communist Party and the entire Chinese people was to overcome the danger of the split of the anti-Japanese national united front and capitulation, because capitulation would lead to deep national disasters and subject the Chinese people to colonial slavery under Japanese imperialism.

    At that time, the Chinese Communist Party correctly prescribed a path to overcome this danger, which was to strengthen the struggle of all patriotic and democratic forces of the Chinese people against Japanese imperialism, traitors, and capitulationists. All the people, all the armed forces within China, all nationalities, all patriotic parties and groups, and all overseas Chinese must be drawn into this struggle. This main task and guideline of uniting all forces and consolidating the united front determined the policy and strategy of the Chinese Communist Party during this period.

    On January 28, 1940, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions to party organizations at all levels to "Overcome the Danger of Capitulation and Strive for a Turn for the Better in the Situation." The instructions pointed out that "the direction of capitulation of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie is opposed to the direction of resistance of the proletariat, peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie, and middle bourgeoisie, and the two sides are in struggle." [1]

    The Central Committee called on Communist Party members to resolutely resist capitulation activities and overcome the threat of splitting the anti-Japanese national united front. The Central Committee organized this resistance based on the following considerations: both domestic and international environments had factors that would consolidate the anti-Japanese united front and make it difficult for Chiang Kai-shek to implement a policy of capitulation.

    The main factor was that the Chinese Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, the guerrilla base areas, and the democratic governments had developed into powerful forces in the liberated areas and behind enemy lines, victoriously resisting Japanese imperialism. In this struggle, they relied closely on the resolute and enthusiastic support of the working class and peasants, who accounted for more than 90% of the national population. The urban petty bourgeoisie, intellectuals, and middle bourgeoisie also supported the war of resistance.

    Although the Chiang Kai-shek group held power within the Kuomintang at that time, this group was only a tiny minority. Most Kuomintang members opposed the policy of capitulation, which also promoted the development of the anti-Japanese struggle.

    The characteristics of the international environment at that time were the increasingly sharp contradictions between imperialists that led to the European and Pacific wars, which were also conducive to the continued and smooth struggle of the Chinese people. The existence of the Soviet Union and its warm sympathy for the Chinese people who were striving for independence and freedom was a decisive international factor.

    Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrote: "Under the above circumstances, the task of the party is: on the one hand, to resolutely resist the military offensive and political offensive of the capitulationist die-hards; on the other hand, to actively develop the united front of all parties, governments, armies, civilians, students, and other aspects of the country, to strive for the majority in the Kuomintang, to strive for the middle classes, to strive for sympathizers in the anti-Japanese army, to strive for the deepening of the mass movement, to strive for the intellectuals, to strive for the consolidation of the anti-Japanese base areas and the development of the anti-Japanese armed forces and anti-Japanese regime, and to strive for the consolidation and progress of the party." [2]

    Comrade Mao Tse-tung, in "On Policy," "The Strategic Problems in the Current Anti-Japanese United Front," and other works, clarified the policies of the Chinese Communist Party during the Anti-Japanese War, and warned against the danger of repeating past "leftist" and rightist opportunist errors.

    The Communist Party implemented a flexible policy during the Anti-Japanese War aimed at consolidating the anti-Japanese national united front. Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrote: "...The anti-Japanese national united front policy is neither all alliance and no struggle, nor all struggle and no alliance, but a policy that combines alliance and struggle." [3]

    This specifically illustrates that the Communist Party was trying to unite all workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals, and the national bourgeoisie, and all anti-Japanese forces, in the anti-Japanese national united front, but at the same time, it implemented an independent and autonomous policy within the united front and in its relations with other parties in this front.

    For example, on military issues, the party implemented an independent and autonomous operational line under unified strategic leadership.

    In the Japanese-occupied areas, the Chinese Communist Party tried to combine open work and secret work to expand the anti-Japanese national united front. The party used all legal opportunities on the one hand, and established long-term underground work on the other, accumulating strength to await opportunities.

    In the liberated areas and guerrilla base areas, as pointed out in the article "The Question of Political Power in the Anti-Japanese Base Areas," the Communist Party implemented a policy of democratic construction based on the unity of all classes, strata, and groups willing to resist Japan. In the democratically elected political organs, Communist Party members only accounted for one-third, giving two-thirds of the seats to non-party members and representatives of other democratic parties participating in the united front.

    On the land issue, the policy of rent reduction and interest reduction was used to replace the policy of confiscating landlords' land, and wasteland and the land of traitors who had defected to the Japanese were distributed to landless and land-poor peasants.

    The Communist Party used all the contradictions within the Kuomintang, supported progressives, and gradually won over the wavering middle majority, opposing the anti-communist and reactionary minority of the Kuomintang.

    Volume III of "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung" contains rich materials on the Chinese Communists' struggle for the victory of the principles of Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory. Comrade Mao Tse-tung's works prove how the Chinese Communist Party creatively developed this theory based on the conditions of the Chinese people's national liberation struggle.

    The article "'The Communist' Inaugural Message," written on October 4, 1939, is of great theoretical significance in this regard. Comrade Mao Tse-tung analyzed in this article the specific circumstances and characteristics of the historical development of the Chinese revolution (a revolution that was primarily an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal bourgeois democratic revolution). The proletariat, peasants, and urban petty bourgeoisie were the basic driving forces of this revolution, and the national bourgeoisie would also participate in this revolution to a certain extent and during a certain period.

    The basic problems encountered by the Chinese Communist Party in the revolutionary process were the united front, armed struggle, and party building. Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrote: "...The united front, armed struggle, and party building are the three magic weapons, the three main magic weapons, for the Chinese Communist Party to defeat the enemy in the Chinese revolution. This is the great achievement of the Chinese Communist Party and also the great achievement of the Chinese revolution." [4]

    When talking about the united front, Comrade Mao Tse-tung emphasized that because the greatest oppression in semi-colonial countries like old China was national oppression, the national bourgeoisie could participate in the struggle against imperialism and feudal warlords to a certain extent and during a certain period. Therefore, the proletariat should establish a united front with the national bourgeoisie during this period and maintain it as much as possible.

    Comrade Mao Tse-tung pointed out that if the united front was mainly to oppose a certain foreign imperialist enemy, such as opposing Japanese imperialism, then a part of the comprador bourgeoisie might also support the national united front during a certain period. This instruction had great significance during the Chinese people's Anti-Japanese War. Comrade Mao Tse-tung explained this fact as follows: China was in a semi-colonial position, and the imperialist powers each had their spheres of influence in China, so the comprador bourgeoisie, warlords, and Kuomintang were also divided into various groups. These groups were closely colluded with certain foreign monopoly groups, and the foreign monopoly groups raised them as their lackeys in China. Therefore, when a certain imperialist country invaded China and intensified the contradictions between imperialists, some of these groups would rise up to resist this aggression to a certain extent.

    Comrade Mao Tse-tung revealed the harmfulness and errors of "leftist" closed-doorism and rightist opportunism in dealing with the Chinese national bourgeoisie. "Leftist" closed-doorists viewed the Chinese bourgeoisie as the same as the bourgeoisie in capitalist countries, thus neglecting the policy of establishing a united front with the bourgeoisie.

    "On the other hand, we must oppose the error of regarding the program, policies, thoughts, and practices of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie as the same, and ignoring the fundamental differences between them." [5] Neglecting this aspect would lead to rightist opportunist errors. An important part of the Chinese Communist Party's party building was developed and tempered in the midst of uniting with the bourgeoisie and struggling against it. "The so-called alliance here is the united front with the bourgeoisie. The so-called struggle, when allied with the bourgeoisie, is a 'peaceful' and 'bloodless' struggle in thought, politics, and organization; and when forced to split with the bourgeoisie, it turns into armed struggle." [6]

    When talking about the second main characteristic of the development of the Chinese revolution, namely that armed struggle is the main form, Comrade Mao Tse-tung pointed out: "The Chinese Communist Party's armed struggle is a peasant war under the leadership of the proletariat." [7]

    Comrade Mao Tse-tung made a detailed explanation of the various stages of development of the Chinese Communist Party when deeply analyzing the third main problem, namely the problem of party building, and pointed out the characteristics of party building, development, and consolidation at each stage.

    During the Anti-Japanese War, relying on past experience, the party's organizational strength and armed forces, the party's high political prestige among the people of the country, and the party's deeper understanding of Marxist-Leninist theory, the party not only established the anti-Japanese national united front, but also mobilized the people of the country to carry out the Anti-Japanese War. The Chinese Communist Party became a large national party. The party's political influence in the country expanded and strengthened. At the same time, a large number of new party members who had not received any political training poured into the party ranks. Many party organizations were not solid enough, and a large part of the cadres did not have revolutionary experience.

    The article "'The Communist' Inaugural Message" played a major role in overcoming the shortcomings of the Chinese Communist Party's party building. This article pointed out a clear line for consolidating the party organizationally and ideologically.

    ×    ×    ×

    Under the extremely difficult conditions of the long-term armed struggle, the Chinese Communist Party formulated and successfully implemented a clear and flexible political line, strategy, and tactics for the Chinese people's anti-Japanese war of liberation. At the same time, the party formulated a program for building a new China.

    This well-founded program was initially discussed in brief outlines and general principles in various speeches and essays, and was later elaborated in Comrade Mao Tse-tung's works "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "On New Democracy."

    In the work "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," a profound analysis was made of the development of Chinese history and the characteristics of the Chinese people's liberation struggle. Comrade Mao Tse-tung pointed out how China was transformed into a semi-colony of imperialism due to the intrusion of foreign capital, and how Chinese society was transformed from a feudal society into a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society.

    The historical task of the Chinese people is to transform this old society into a new, independent, free, and people's democratic society. This goal cannot be achieved without overthrowing the rule of imperialism and feudalism. That is why the revolution has always been an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution at all stages of its development.

    Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrote that the Chinese revolution was realized under the leadership of the proletariat by an alliance of several revolutionary classes (the proletariat, peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie in a certain period). The proletariat and the peasants are the main revolutionary driving forces.

    In Comrade Mao Tse-tung's works, special attention is paid to the peasant problem (one of the most important problems in the Chinese revolution). The author pointed out that a fierce process of differentiation was taking place among the peasants, who accounted for almost 80% of the Chinese population, and analyzed in detail the social composition of the countryside. At that time, poor peasants and farm laborers accounted for 70% of the Chinese rural population, and they either had no land at all or felt that their land was very insufficient. Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrote: Poor peasants "are the semi-proletariat in the countryside, the broadest motive force of the Chinese revolution, the natural and most reliable ally of the proletariat, and the main force in China's revolutionary ranks." [8]

    The author emphasized: "The poor peasants and middle peasants can only be liberated under the leadership of the proletariat; and the proletariat can only lead the revolution to victory by forming a solid alliance with the poor and middle peasants" [9].

    Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrote that revolutionary intellectuals and young students are an important force in the Chinese democratic revolution (see "The May Fourth Movement," "The Orientation of the Youth Movement," "Absorb Intellectuals in Large Numbers," etc.).

    Comrade Mao Tse-tung emphasized that intellectuals are weak and incompetent if they are not combined with the broad masses of workers and peasants. He put forward a very appropriate standard for measuring the true political face of every intellectual:

    "To see whether they are willing to and do combine with the worker and peasant masses. Their final demarcation lies only in this point, not in what they say... True revolutionaries must be willing to and do combine with the worker and peasant masses." [10]

    Because the revolution is realized by an alliance of several revolutionary classes, the democratic regime and democratic state established during and after the revolution can only be a joint dictatorship of several revolutionary classes under the leadership of the proletariat, and the worker-peasant alliance is the basis of this dictatorship.

    The author wrote that this is also the main content of the Chinese revolution. Since the emergence of the working class in China and the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party to lead the Chinese people in their liberation struggle, the Chinese revolution is no longer a bourgeois democratic revolution in the old category, but a new type of bourgeois democratic revolution, or as Comrade Mao Tse-tung said at the time, a new democratic revolution.

    Comrade Mao Tse-tung also emphasized that because the fundamental transformation of world history after the October Socialist Revolution, the Chinese revolution is a new democratic revolution, and the country established by this revolution is a new democratic country. If all the old bourgeois democratic revolutions completed in the West were to clear the way for the development of capitalism, which was then on the rise, then now capitalism is dying capitalism, and in a large part of the world, capitalism has been overthrown and replaced by socialism.

    Comrade Mao Tse-tung pointed out that the Chinese people's liberation struggle and the Chinese revolution are an inseparable part of this worldwide historical process, and it can only achieve complete victory by joining the socialist camp and obtaining the support and assistance of this camp. If it leaves this camp and does not have its direct support and assistance, the Chinese people can never achieve complete final victory at any time, cannot have true prosperity, and cannot have true independence and freedom.

    The work "On New Democracy" in Volume III pointed out that because China's bourgeois democratic revolution is no longer an old-fashioned general bourgeois democratic revolution, it is developing in a new international environment where socialism is rising and capitalism is declining, so the result of this revolution should not be the establishment of a capitalist society and the establishment of a bourgeois dictatorship in China under any circumstances. On the contrary, the ultimate prospect of the Chinese revolution is socialism and communism, not capitalism.

    "The democratic revolution is a necessary preparation for the socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution is the inevitable trend of the democratic revolution. And the final goal of all communists is to strive for the final completion of socialist society and communist society." [11]

    Comrade Mao Tse-tung foresaw that the Chinese New Democratic Revolution would lead to a certain development of capitalist elements, and at the same time pointed out that the main result of the revolution should be the development of socialist elements. When explaining the characteristics of socialist elements, he wrote: "It is the increase in the proportion of the proletariat and the Communist Party in the national political forces, it is the peasants, intellectuals, and urban petty bourgeoisie... recognize the leadership of the proletariat and the Communist Party, it is the state-owned economy of the democratic republic and the cooperative economy of the working people. All of this is a socialist element. With the favorable international environment... in the end, avoiding the prospects of capitalism and realizing the prospects of socialism cannot but have great possibilities." [12]

    This is also the case. At present, four years after the Chinese people have achieved great victory, the socialist elements of the People's Republic of China have developed into a powerful force.

    In Volume III of "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung" there is an article "The Consistency of Soviet Interests and Human Interests," which was written in September 1939 to commemorate the upcoming 22nd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. There is also an article "Stalin is a Friend of the Chinese People," which was written to celebrate the sixtieth birthday of J. V. Stalin, and a conversation with a Xinhua Daily reporter on the Soviet Union's foreign policy at that time, and other articles. In these articles, Comrade Mao Tse-tung developed the idea of strengthening the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, indicating that the Soviet Union's selfless and brotherly friendship and help were favorable international conditions to guarantee the Chinese people's liberation struggle and defeat the enemy.

    Comrade Mao Tse-tung explained that the Soviet Union's foreign policy has always been consistently to defend the interests of peace and security of all peoples, to safeguard the interests of the victims of fascist aggression and the interests of the progress of all mankind.

    When exposing the malicious attacks by the enemies of the Soviet Union who insisted that the interests of the Soviet Union conflicted with the interests of China's national liberation, Comrade Mao Tse-tung said: "The interests of the Soviet Union and the interests of China's national liberation will never conflict with each other, but will always be consistent with each other. I think there is absolutely no doubt about this." [13]

    Comrade Mao Tse-tung used simple and obvious facts to show that the Soviet Union's relationship with China is completely different from the capitalist countries' plundering relationship with China. These countries often pretend to be China's "friends." "But this kind of friend can only belong to Li Linfu of the Tang Dynasty. Li Linfu was the prime minister of the Tang Dynasty and a famous person known as 'honey-mouthed and dagger-hearted.' Now these so-called 'friends' are exactly 'honey-mouthed and dagger-hearted' friends. Who are these people? They are the imperialists who call themselves sympathetic to China." [14]

    Based on the well-known facts of the Soviet Union's selfless and brotherly help to the Chinese people and the signing of truly equal treaties and agreements between China and the Soviet Union, Comrade Mao Tse-tung concluded that only socialist countries can truly assist the Chinese people's cause of national and social liberation. "...The Chinese people's love and respect for Stalin and their friendship with the Soviet Union are completely sincere, and no one's attempts to provoke discord or spread rumors and slander will be of any use in the end." [15]

    Real life has confirmed the complete correctness of this argument.

    ×    ×    ×

    Comrade Mao Tse-tung's works profoundly and clearly explain all aspects of the social life and heroic struggle of our friend, the great Chinese people, and the brotherly party, the Chinese Communist Party. These works are examples of creatively studying Marxism, and examples of combining the revolutionary Marxist-Leninist theory with the practice of the Chinese people's liberation struggle and the activities of the Communist Party of one of the world's largest countries.

    In these works, there are important theoretical summaries and specific analyses of the general and individual problems of the Chinese revolution, as well as the problems of national democratic construction and the policies and practical activities of the Chinese Communist Party. Comrade Mao Tse-tung's works are of great theoretical and practical significance for the entire international national liberation movement and the communist movement.

专栏：

    介绍“毛泽东选集”俄文版第三卷
    苏联  阿·亚历山德罗夫
    外国书籍出版局不久前出版了从中文译成俄文的“毛泽东选集”第三卷。本卷收集了毛泽东同志在一九三九年五月至一九四一年五月这段期间的论文、演说及其他著作。
    在毛泽东同志的“目前形势和党的任务”、
    “克服投降危险，力争时局好转”、“团结一切抗日力量，反对反共顽固派”、“打退第二次反共高潮后的时局”等著作中，阐明了当时中国国内的政治情况。下面的一些主要事实可以说明这一政治情况的特征。
    日本侵略者向中国内部长驱直入，占领了广大的领土，其中包括北京、天津、上海、南京、汉口、广州、长沙等重要城市。但是，日寇的进攻力量由于受到中国人民的抵抗已经消耗很大。在其后方，在中国共产党的发起和领导之下，建立了无数巩固的游击根据地。八路军和新四军等人民革命军队依靠这些根据地胜利地展开了抗日武装斗争。因此，日寇逐渐停止其对国民党军队的进攻，而将其主力用来对付八路军和新四军。同时，日本帝国主义者又向国民党展开了“政治攻势”，企图使其屈膝投降。
    以汉奸汪精卫为首的一部分大买办资产阶级、大地主和国民党官僚，公开投入日本帝国主义怀抱，和日寇订立了卖国条约，使广大的中国领土沦为日本的殖民地。
    以蒋介石为首的另一部分大买办资产阶级、大地主和国民党官僚，即所谓顽固派，虽则表面上仍留在抗日民族统一战线中，但事实上他们却从事着破坏和分裂统一战线的活动，奉行反共反人民的政策。
    一九三九年六月十二日国民党分子在平江枪杀了新四军通讯处工作人员涂正坤、罗梓铭以及其他积极抗日的爱国志士。反动派和投降主义者把这次屠杀视为挑起国民党和共产党间武装冲突以遂其分裂统一战线和恢复内战的阴谋的信号。一九四一年一月发生了袭击新四军总部的皖南事变。
    蒋介石开始对八路军的中央根据地陕甘宁边区实行封锁。按照他的指示，国民党军队在各个不同的地区开始对八路军和新四军部队进行军事挑衅。
    在这种情况下，中国共产党和全中国人民的主要任务就是克服抗日民族统一战线的分裂和投降的危险，因为投降会招致民族的深重灾难，会使中国人民受到日本帝国主义的殖民地奴役。
    当时中国共产党正确地规定了一条克服这种危险的道路，这就是加强中国人民一切爱国民主力量反对日本帝国主义、反对汉奸和投降主义者的斗争。必须把全体人民，中国境内的一切武装力量，各民族、各爱国党派和团体以及所有国外华侨，吸引到这一斗争中来。这种团结一切力量和巩固统一战线的主要任务和方针规定了中国共产党在这个时期的政策和策略。
    一九四○年一月二十八日中国共产党中央委员会向各级党组织发出了“克服投降危险，力争时局好转”的指示。指示中指出“大地主大资产阶级的投降方向和无产阶级、农民、城市小资产阶级、中等资产阶级的抗战方向，是对立的，双方在斗争中。”〔一〕
    党中央委员会号召共产党员坚决反抗投降活动和克服分裂抗日民族统一战线的威胁。中央委员会在组织这一反抗时是从下述情况出发的：当时在国内、国际环境中都存在着巩固抗日统一战线和使蒋介石不易执行投降政策的因素。
    这些因素中主要的一个，便是中国共产党、八路军、新四军、游击根据地和民主政权，在解放区和敌后已发展成为强大的力量，胜利地抗击了日本帝国主义。在这一斗争中，他们紧紧地依靠了占全国人口百分之九十以上的工人阶级与农民的坚决和热烈的支援。城市小资产阶级、知识分子、中等资产阶级也是拥护抗战的。
    当时国民党内的权力虽然掌握在蒋介石集团手中，但这个集团只是极少数的人，大部分国民党员是反对投降政策的，这一点也促进了抗日斗争的开展。
    当时国际环境的特点是引起欧洲和太平洋战争的帝国主义的矛盾日益尖锐，这一点也有利于中国人民继续顺利地进行斗争。而苏联的存在及其对争取独立和自由的中国人民的热烈同情则是决定性的国际因素。
    毛泽东同志写道：“在上述情况下，党的任务就在于：一方面，坚决反抗投降派顽固派的军事进攻和政治进攻；又一方面，积极发展全国党政军民学各方面的统一战线，力争国民党中的大多数，力争中间阶层，力争抗战军队中的同情者，力争民众运动的深入，力争知识分子，力争抗日根据地的巩固和抗日武装、抗日政权的发展，力争党的巩固和进步。”〔二〕
    ×    ×    ×
    毛泽东同志在“论政策”、“目前抗日统一战线中的策略问题”以及其他著作中阐明了中国共产党在抗日战争时期的政策，并对可能重犯过去“左”倾和右倾机会主义错误的危险提出了警告。
    共产党在抗日战争时期实行了旨在巩固抗日民族统一战线的灵活政策。毛泽东同志写道：“……抗日民族统一战线政策，既不是一切联合否认斗争，又不是一切斗争否认联合，而是综合联合和斗争两方面的政策。”〔三〕
    这就具体地说明共产党是力图把所有工人、农民、士兵、知识分子和民族资产阶级，把所有一切抗日的力量，团结在抗日民族统一战线中，但同时在统一战线中，在与这一战线中的其他各党派的关系上又实行了独立自主的政策。
    例如在军事问题上，党实行了在战略统一领导下的独立自主的作战路线。
    在日寇占领区，中国共产党力图把公开工作和秘密工作结合起来以扩大抗日民族统一战线。党一方面利用一切合法的机会，一方面建立了长期埋伏的地下工作，积蓄力量，以待时机。
    在解放区和游击根据地，正如在“抗日根据地的政权问题”一文中所指出的，共产党在团结各阶级、阶层和愿意抗日的团体的基础上，实行了民主建设的政策。在经过选举产生的民主政权机关中，共产党员只占三分之一，把三分之二的席位让与参加统一战线的非党人士和其他民主党派代表。
    在土地问题上，则以减租减息的政策代替没收地主土地的政策，并将荒地和投靠日寇的汉奸的土地分给无地和少地的农民。
    共产党利用了国民党内部的一切矛盾，支持进步分子，一步一步地争取动摇的中间的多数，反对国民党反共的反动的少数。

    “毛泽东选集”第三卷包含有关于中国共产党人争取马克思列宁主义革命理论原则的胜利的丰富材料。毛泽东同志的著作证明中国共产党是怎样根据中国人民的民族解放斗争的条件创造性地发展了这一理论。
    一九三九年十月四日所写的“‘共产党人’发刊词”一文，在这方面有巨大的理论意义。毛泽东同志在这篇文章中分析了中国革命（这个革命首先是反帝反封建的资产阶级民主革命）历史发展过程中具体情况和特点。无产阶级、农民、城市小资产阶级是这一革命的基本动力，而民族资产阶级在一定时期中和一定程度上也会参加这一革命。
    中国共产党在革命进程中所碰到的基本问题是统一战线问题、武装斗争问题和党的建设问题。毛泽东同志写道：“……统一战线，武装斗争，党的建设，是中国共产党在中国革命中战胜敌人的三个法宝，三个主要的法宝。这是中国共产党的伟大成绩，也是中国革命的伟大成绩。”〔四〕
    毛泽东同志在谈到统一战线时强调指出，由于像旧中国这样的半殖民地国家中最大的压迫是民族压迫，民族资产阶级在一定时期中，在一定程度上，是能够参加反帝国主义和反封建军阀的斗争的。因此，无产阶级在这种时期就应该同民族资产阶级建立统一战线，并尽可能地保持下去。
    毛泽东同志指出，如果统一战线主要是为了反对某一个外国帝国主义敌人，例如反对日本帝国主义，那末，一部分大买办资产阶级在一定时期内也可能拥护民族统一战线。这一指示在中国人民抗日战争时期有很大的意义。对于这一事实，毛泽东同志作了如下的解释：中国处于半殖民地地位，帝国主义列强在中国各有其势力范围，因而买办资产阶级、军阀和国民党也分为各种不同的集团。这些集团和一定的外国垄断集团紧密地勾结在一起，外国垄断集团把他们豢养成自己在中国的走狗。因此，当某一帝国主义国家侵略中国而使帝国主义间的矛盾尖锐化的时候，其中某些集团就会在一定程度上起来反抗这种侵略。
    毛泽东同志揭露了在对待中国民族资产阶级这
    一问题上的“左”倾关门主义和右倾机会主义的危害性和错误。“左”倾关门主义者把中国资产阶级和资本主义国家的资产阶级看做一样，因而忽视同资产阶级建立统一战线的政策。
    “另一方面，则要反对把无产阶级和资产阶级的纲领、政策、思想、实践等等看做一样的东西，忽视它们之间的原则差别的错误。”〔五〕忽视了这
    一方面就会犯右倾机会主义的错误。中国共产党的党的建设的重要一部分，就是在同资产阶级联合又同它斗争的中间发展起来和锻炼出来的。“这里所谓联合，就是同资产阶级的统一战线。所谓斗争，在同资产阶级联合时，就是在思想上、政治上、组织上的‘和平’的‘不流血’的斗争；而在被迫着同资产阶级分裂时，就转变为武装斗争。”〔六〕
    谈到中国革命发展过程的第二个主要特点即武装斗争是主要形式时，毛泽东同志指出：“中国共产党的武装斗争，就是在无产阶级领导之下的农民战争。”〔七〕
    毛泽东同志在深刻地分析第三个主要问题即党的建设问题时，对中国共产党的各个发展阶段作了详尽的说明，指出了在每一阶段上党的建设、发展和巩固的特点。
    在抗日时期，党凭借着过去的经验，凭借着党的组织力量和武装力量，凭借着党在全国人民中间很高的政治威信，凭借着党对于马克思列宁主义的理论之更加深入的理解，不但建立了抗日民族统一战线，而且发动了全国人民进行抗日战争。中国共产党变成了全国性的大党。党在全国的政治影响扩大而加强了。同时，大批没有受到任何政治锻炼的新党员涌进党的队伍里来。很多的党组织不够巩固，很大一部分干部还没有革命经验。
    “‘共产党人’发刊词”一文对克服中国共产党建党中的缺点起了重大的作用。这篇文章指出了从组织上和思想上巩固党的明确路线。

    中国共产党在长期武装斗争极端困难的条件下，制订了并成功地实现了中国人民抗日解放战争的明确而灵活的政治路线、战略和策略。同时党制订了建设新中国的纲领。
    这一有深刻根据的纲领，起初用简要的提纲和一般的原则在各篇演说和论文中论述了，后来则在毛泽东同志的著作“中国革命和中国共产党”和
    “新民主主义论”中加以论述。
    在“中国革命和中国共产党”这一著作中，对中国历史的发展、对中国人民解放斗争的特点作了深刻的分析。毛泽东同志指出中国怎样由于外国资本的侵入而变成了帝国主义的半殖民地，中国社会怎样由封建社会变成了半封建半殖民地的社会。
    中国人民的历史任务是把这一旧社会变成独立和自由的人民民主的新社会。如果不打倒帝国主义和封建主义的统治就不能达到这一目的。这就是为什么革命在其发展的各个阶段中始终都是反帝反封建的革命。
    毛泽东同志写道，中国的革命是在无产阶级领导下由几个革命阶级（无产阶级、农民、城市小资产阶级、以及在一定时期内的民族资产阶级）的联盟来实现的。无产阶级和农民是主要的革命动力。
    在毛泽东同志的著作中对农民问题（中国革命中最重要的问题之一）是特别重视的。著者指出在几乎占中国人口百分之八十的农民中间正在进行着激烈的分化过程时，详尽地分析了乡村的社会成份。当时贫雇农占中国农村人口百分之七十，他们不是完全没有土地，就是感到土地很不足。毛泽东同志写道：贫农“是农村中的半无产阶级，是中国革命的最广大的动力，是无产阶级的天然的和最可靠的同盟者，是中国革命队伍的主力军”。〔八〕
    著者强调指出：“贫农和中农都只有在无产阶级的领导之下，才能得到解放；而无产阶级也只有和贫农、中农结成坚固的联盟，才能领导革命到达胜利”〔九〕。
    毛泽东同志写道，革命知识分子和青年学生是中国民主革命的重要力量（见“五四运动”、“青年运动的方向”、“大量吸收知识分子”等文）。
    毛泽东同志强调指出，知识分子如果不与广大工农群众相结合则是软弱无能的。他提出了一个衡量每个知识分子的真正政治面目的极恰当的标准：
    “看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。他们的最后分界仅仅在这一点，而不在乎口讲……。真正的革命者必定是愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合的。”〔十〕
    因为革命是由几个革命阶级的联盟来实现的，所以在革命过程中和革命胜利后建立起来的民主政权和民主国家也只能是在无产阶级领导下的几个革命阶级的联合专政，工农联盟则是这一专政的基础。
    著者写道，这一点也正是中国革命的主要内容。自从在中国出现了工人阶级并建立了领导中国人民进行解放斗争的中国共产党以后，中国革命已不再是旧范畴的资产阶级民主革命，而是新式的资产阶级民主革命，或者像毛泽东同志当时所说的，是新民主主义革命。
    毛泽东同志同时强调指出，由于十月社会主义革命以后全世界历史发生了根本的转变，中国革命是新民主主义革命，而这种革命所建立起来的国家，则是新民主主义的国家。如果说西方所完成的
    一切旧的资产阶级民主革命的任务，是为当时走上坡路的资本主义的发展扫清道路，那末，现在资本主义已是垂死的资本主义，在世界很大一片土地上资本主义已被推翻而让位于社会主义了。
    毛泽东同志指出，中国人民的解放斗争和中国革命是这一全世界历史过程的不可分割的组成部分，它只有加入社会主义阵营并取得这一阵营的支持和援助才能获得彻底的胜利。如果离开这一阵营，没有它的直接支持和援助，中国人民任何时候也不能取得完全的最后的胜利，不能有真正的繁荣，不能有真正的独立和自由。
    第三卷里的“新民主主义论”这一著作指出，因为中国的资产阶级民主革命已不是旧式的一般的资产阶级民主革命，它是在社会主义高涨而资本主义没落的新的国际环境中发展起来的，所以这种革命的结果无论如何也不应当是在中国建立资本主义社会，建立资产阶级专政。恰恰相反，中国革命的最终的远景是社会主义和共产主义，而不是资本主义。
    “民主主义革命是社会主义革命的必要准备，社会主义革命是民主主义革命的必然趋势。而一切共产主义者的最后目的，则是在于力争社会主义社会和共产主义社会的最后的完成。”〔十一〕
    毛泽东同志预见到中国新民主主义革命要招致资本主义因素的某种发展，同时指出，革命的主要结果应当是社会主义因素的发展。在说明社会主义因素的特点时，他写道：“就是无产阶级和共产党在全国政治势力中的比重的增长，就是农民、知识分子和城市小资产阶级……承认无产阶级和共产党的领导权，就是民主共和国的国营经济和劳动人民的合作经济。所有这一切，都是社会主义的因素。加以国际环境的有利，……最后结果，避免资本主义的前途，实现社会主义的前途，不能不具有极大的可能性了。”〔十二〕
    事实也是如此，在目前，在中国人民已取得了伟大胜利的四年后，中华人民共和国的社会主义因素已经发展成强大的力量。

    “毛泽东选集”第三卷中有“苏联利益和人类利益的一致”的一篇文章，是一九三九年九月为纪念即将到来的伟大的十月社会主义革命二十二周年而写的。另外有“斯大林是中国人民的朋友”一文，是为祝贺约·维·斯大林六十寿辰而作的，还有一篇关于当时苏联对外政策对新华日报记者的谈话以及其他等文章。在这几篇文章中，毛泽东同志发展了加强中国与苏联友谊的思想，指明苏联的大公无私的兄弟般的友谊和帮助，是保证中国人民解放斗争和打败敌人的有利的国际条件。
    毛泽东同志说明了苏联对外政策始终一贯地是保卫各族人民的和平与安全的利益的，是维护法西斯侵略下的受难者的利益和全人类进步的利益的。
    毛泽东同志在揭露苏联敌人硬说苏联利益与中国民族解放利益相冲突的恶意攻击时说道：“苏联的利益和中国民族解放的利益决不会互相冲突，而将是永久互相一致。这一点，我认为绝对没有疑义。”〔十三〕
    毛泽东同志用简单而明显的事实表明苏联对中国的关系与资本主义国家对中国掠夺的关系有天渊之别。这些国家经常装作中国的“朋友”。“但是这种朋友，只能属于唐朝的李林甫一类。李林甫是唐朝的宰相，是一个有名的被称为‘口蜜腹剑’的人。现在这些所谓‘朋友’，正是‘口蜜腹剑’的朋友。这些人是谁呢？就是那些口称同情中国的帝国主义者。”〔十四〕
    根据众所周知的苏联对中国人民大公无私的兄弟般的帮助和中苏两国签订真正平等条约和协定的事实，毛泽东同志作出结论说，只有社会主义国家才能真正援助中国人民的民族解放和社会解放的事业。“……中国人民对于斯大林的敬爱，对于苏联的友谊，是完全出于诚意的，任何人的挑拨离间，造谣污蔑，到底都没有用处。”〔十五〕
    现实生活证实了这一论断的全部正确性。

    毛泽东同志的著作，深刻而明确地阐明了我们的朋友伟大的中国人民和兄弟党——中国共产党在社会生活和英勇的斗争中各方面的问题。这些著作是创造性地研究马克思主义的范例，是把革命的马克思列宁主义理论和中国人民解放斗争的实践，和世界上最大国家之一的共产党的活动相结合的范例。
    在这些著作中，有对中国革命总的问题和个别问题以及国家民主建设和中国共产党的政策和实际活动等问题所做的重要的理论总结和具体分析。毛泽东同志的著作，对于整个国际民族解放运动和共产主义运动，在理论上和实践上都有巨大的意义。
