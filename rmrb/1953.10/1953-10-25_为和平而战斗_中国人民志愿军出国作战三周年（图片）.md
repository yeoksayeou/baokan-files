    For three years, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fought side by side against the American aggressors and achieved great victories. In accordance with the armistice order issued by Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, they withdrew all military forces from the demilitarized zone within seventy-two hours after the armistice agreement came into effect and established new "home bases" on the "armistice line," closely monitoring any destructive actions from the other side. This is a scene of Chinese and Korean commanders jointly studying the defensive arrangements of the front line.

    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军三年来并肩抗击美国侵略者，取得伟大的胜利。他们遵照朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军发布的停战命令，在停战协定生效后的七十二小时内，将一切军事力量撤出了非军事区，并在“停战线”上建立了新的“阵地之家”，密切地监视着来自对方的任何破坏行动。这是中、朝指挥员共同研究前沿阵地设防的情形。
