Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th – The "Pravda" published an article by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. The title of the article is "The German Democratic Republic - A Fortress of Peace-Loving Forces in All of Germany."

    Ulbricht pointed out that the historical significance of the founding of the German Democratic Republic lies in the fact that it constitutes a serious obstacle to the path of imperialist aggressive forces and has become one of the fortresses of peace in Europe.

    Ulbricht then stated that the peace-loving forces of Germany are grateful to the Soviet people and the Soviet government because, on the issue of concluding a peace treaty and establishing a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany, the Soviet Union has steadfastly defended the national interests of the German people.

    Ulbricht spoke in detail about the selfless assistance provided by the Soviet Union to the German Democratic Republic in terms of economic and cultural development and emphasized the great significance of the results of the Moscow talks between the governments of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic.

    Ulbricht wrote: The historical task of the working class, peasants, and all democratic forces of the German Democratic Republic is to greatly develop the national economy in the course of implementing the Five-Year Plan in order to improve the material life of the working people, thereby proving to the working people of West Germany the superiority of the progressive new system that the German Democratic Republic has already laid down.

    Ulbricht pointed out that in the four years since the founding of the German Democratic Republic, the working people of the Republic have achieved great successes. Industrial production at the end of 1953 will be 165 percent of the 1936 level. Compared with 1950, the trade volume in 1953 will reach 165 percent, in 1954 it will increase to 177 percent, and in 1955 it will increase to 185 percent.

    The Republic is continuing to build the foundations of socialism. At the end of 1953, the output of public enterprises, that is, enterprises of a socialist nature, will reach 84 percent of the total industrial output. Ulbricht mentioned the great assistance given to farmers by the government and pointed out that the German Democratic Republic will have to overcome considerable difficulties caused by the division of Germany.

    Ulbricht pointed out: Only with the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union can we complete our current great economic tasks. Soviet science, engineering, and art are having a tremendous and effective influence on the political, economic, ideological, and cultural life of the German Democratic Republic, helping the working class and all working people of democratic Germany to lay the foundations of socialism and build a new life in Germany.

    Ulbricht spoke of the American occupiers and West German militarists who are doing everything possible to obstruct the relaxation of tensions in Europe. He concluded by writing: The Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the government of the German Democratic Republic have pointed out to the German people the true path to restoring Germany's unity in peace and freedom. The most important task at present is to expand the unity of the entire German working class in the struggle against the enemies of Germany, the American imperialists and the West German militarists. It is necessary to further consolidate the unity of the working class and the working peasants, and to launch a broad patriotic people's movement to strive for the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.

    乌布利希撰文庆祝德意志民主共和国国庆
    【新华社七日讯】　据塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：“真理报”发表了德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记瓦尔特·乌布利希为庆祝德意志民主共和国成立第四周年所写的一篇文章，文章的题目是“德意志民主共和国——整个德国爱好和平力量的堡垒。”
    乌布利希指出：德意志民主共和国成立的历史意义，在于它构成了帝国主义侵略势力道路上的一个严重障碍，它已成为欧洲的和平堡垒之一。
    乌布利希接着说，德国爱好和平的力量感激苏联人民和苏联政府，因为在缔结和约和建立一个统一、爱好和平、民主的德国的问题上，苏联坚持不渝地保卫德国人民的民族利益。
    乌布利希详细谈到苏联在经济和文化发展方面给德意志民主共和国的无私援助，并强调指出了苏联政府与德意志民主共和国政府莫斯科会谈的结果的重大意义。
    乌布利希写道：德意志民主共和国的工人阶级、农民和一切民主力量的历史任务是：在实行五年计划的过程中大大地发展国民经济以提高劳动人民的物质生活，从而向西德的劳动人民证明德意志民主共和国所已经奠立的进步新制度的优越性。
    乌布利希指出，在德意志民主共和国成立四年以来，共和国的劳动人民已获得了巨大的成就。工业生产量在一九五三年底将是一九三六年水平的百分之一六五。与一九五零年比较，贸易额在一九五三年将达到百分之一六五，一九五四年将增加到一七七，而一九五五年将增加到一八五。
    共和国正在继续建立社会主义的基础。在一九五三年年底，公营企业，即社会主义性质企业的产量将达全部工业产量的百分之八十四。乌布利希提到政府给予农民的巨大援助，并指出，德意志民主共和国将不得不克服由于德国的分裂而引起的相当大的困难。
    乌布利希指出：只有在苏联的友好援助下，才能完成我们当前的伟大的经济任务。苏联的科学、工程学与艺术，对于德意志民主共和国的政治、经济、思想与文化生活正发生巨大的、有效的影响，正帮助民主德国的工人阶级与所有劳动人民奠定社会主义的基础并在德国建设新生活。
    乌布利希谈到美国占领者以及西德军国主义者正千方百计来阻挠欧洲紧张局势得到缓和，他最后写道：德国统一社会党以及德意志民主共和国政府已经向德国人民指出了在和平与自由的情况下恢复德国的统一的真正道路。目前最重要的任务是在反对德国的敌人美帝国主义者以及西德军国主义者的斗争中扩大全德工人阶级的团结，必须更加巩固工人阶级与劳动农民的团结，并开展一个广泛的爱国主义人民运动，争取建立一个统一、民主、爱好和平的德国。
