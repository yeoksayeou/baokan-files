    Shorten the Disaster Period
    Since September, the Hebei Daily has prominently publicized the timely planting of wheat and striving for increased wheat production. Some areas of Hebei Province suffered varying degrees of disaster due to excessive rainfall in July and August this year; this has added difficulties to the autumn planting work. However, Hebei is one of China's major wheat-producing areas, and timely planting of wheat and striving for increased wheat production can not only better meet the country's growing need for refined grains, but also play a decisive role in shortening the disaster period. Therefore, the Party and government leading organs of Hebei Province, based on local conditions, have put forward the requirement of striving to plant 35 million mu of wheat this year, with an average yield of 90 jin per mu. In order to strive for the victorious completion of this wheat planting plan, the Hebei Daily has successively published editorials and short articles on September 4, 12, 28, and 30, repeatedly emphasizing the serious significance of increasing wheat production for supporting national economic construction and alleviating the difficulties of the people in disaster areas in production and life next year, pointing out that "actively leading wheat planting is the most prominent central task in current agricultural production," and "delaying wheat planting is a political error." While clarifying the great significance of completing the wheat planting task, the newspaper also paid attention to eliminating ideological obstacles among cadres and the masses. For example, the propagandist's speech published on September 4 criticized the mistakes of some farmers who, after suffering from the disaster, lacked confidence in production and planned to blindly go out to make a living, analyzed the conditions and methods for overcoming difficulties, and mobilized farmers to quickly drain water and prepare the land for wheat planting. On September 28, in response to the blindly optimistic mood among cadres and the masses in some areas due to the recent lack of rain leading to drought in farmland, who still believed that this year's rainfall was high and the soil moisture was good, it was proposed to overcome the idea of relying on heaven and waiting for rain, and to plant wheat in a timely manner. This pointed out the direction of effort for the broad masses of cadres and the masses.
    To complete the wheat planting task, it is necessary to carry out a lot of political and economic work, especially to overcome the many difficulties brought about by the disaster in some areas; and the key to completing this task lies in conscientiously strengthening leadership. The Hebei Daily grasped this key issue and relatively fully reflected the situation of leading organs in various places implementing the instructions of the provincial party committee, taking specific and effective measures, and promoting and leading the wheat planting work. For example, it gave prominent reports on the working methods of the leading organs of Tianjin Special District, who went deep into the lower levels to mobilize the masses to remove accumulated water, timely inspect the wheat planting preparation work, and specifically solve the difficulties in wheat planting. On the other hand, the newspaper promptly criticized phenomena that hindered production, such as Jiahe County's indiscriminate issuance of statistical forms, and the lack of unified or specific leadership in wheat planting work in counties such as Nanhe and Anci. Focusing on the central link of the current work of timely wheat planting, the newspaper also used specific examples to introduce the methods and experiences of various places in draining water to remove land, preparing land to preserve soil moisture, promoting close planting, and solving the problems of wheat seeds, fertilizers, labor, and animal power, in order to promote the development of wheat planting work.
    In order to encourage and mobilize the broad masses of cadres and the masses to overcome the difficulties in wheat planting with a fighting spirit, the Hebei Daily also vigorously praised good people and good deeds in this regard. For example, the report "Liu Yunlu Leads the Whole Village to Plant Wheat Quickly and Well" published on October 6 vividly described how Liu Yunlu, the village director and Communist Party member of Dongli Village, Wuyi County, through patient propaganda and demonstration methods, reversed the thinking of the masses who only cared about immediate interests, busied themselves with weaving mats for money, and were not actively preparing for wheat planting, and specifically helped and mobilized the masses to overcome difficulties such as wet land that was difficult to cultivate and the lack of labor and animal power. As a result, the whole village set off a surge of land cultivation, and in a few days, more than 500 mu of early stubble land was cultivated, and then all the wheat was sown; in addition, 200 mu of late stubble land is also being harvested and prepared to be vacated and then planted with wheat.
    Under the concerted efforts of the broad masses of cadres and the masses, various parts of Hebei Province are currently entering a stage of intense rush planting, and have achieved great results. For example, the Xingtai Special District had completed more than 82 percent of its wheat planting plan by October 5. However, some cadres and masses still have paralyzed thinking such as "this year's rainfall is high, and wheat planting will not be a problem," and have not seized the favorable time for wheat planting. The Hebei Daily pointed out this problem in its report on October 2, and demanded that various places continue to strengthen specific leadership to ensure that the sowing task is completed in the shortest possible time.

### 缩短灾期

    缩短灾期
    九月份以来，河北日报对适时种麦和争取小麦增产进行了突出的宣传。河北省部分地区因今年七、八月份雨水过多，遭受了程度不同的灾害；这就给秋种工作增加了困难。但是河北是我国主要的产麦地区之一，适时种麦并争取小麦增产，不仅可以更好地满足国家对细粮日益增长的需要，而且对于缩短灾期具有决定性的作用。因此河北省党、政领导机关根据当地条件，提出了今年争取种小麦三千五百万亩、平均每亩产九十斤的要求。河北日报为争取胜利完成这一种麦计划，曾在九月四日、十二日、二十八日、三十日连续发表社论、短论，反复强调增产小麦对于支持国家经济建设和减轻灾区人民明年在生产、生活方面困难的严重意义，指出“积极领导种麦是当前农业生产上最突出的中心工作”，“贻误种麦，就要在政治上犯错误”。报纸在阐明完成种麦任务的重大意义的同时，还注意扫除干部和群众中的思想障碍。如九月四日发表的宣传员讲话，就曾批判了部分农民在受灾以后生产信心不足、打算盲目外出的错误，分析了克服困难的条件和办法，动员农民赶快排水誊地准备种麦。九月二十八日又针对部分地区由于近来缺雨以致农田干旱，而干部群众还认为今年雨水多墒情好的盲目乐观情绪，提出克服靠天等雨思想，适时种麦。这就为广大干部群众指明了努力的方向。
    要完成种麦任务，需要进行许多政治经济工作，特别是需要克服由于部分地区受灾而带来的许多困难；而完成这一任务的关键，在于认真加强领导。河北日报抓住了这个关键问题，比较充分地反映了各地领导机关贯彻省委指示，采取具体有效措施，推动和领导种麦工作的情况。如对天津专区领导机关深入下层发动群众排除积水，及时检查种麦准备工作和具体解决种麦困难的作法，就曾作了突出的报道。在另一方面，报纸对交河县滥发统计表格，南和、安次等县对种麦工作缺乏统一领导或具体领导等妨碍生产的现象，及时提出了批评。围绕着适时种麦这一当前工作的中心环节，报纸还运用具体事例介绍了各地排水脱地、整地保墒、推广密植以及解决麦种、肥料、人力、畜力等问题的办法和经验，以推动种麦工作的开展。
    为鼓舞和动员广大干部、群众以战斗精神克服种麦中的困难，河北日报还大力表扬了这方面的好人好事。例如十月六日发表的“刘运录领导全村种麦又快又好”的报道，就曾生动地描述了武邑县东里村村主任、共产党员刘运录通过耐心的宣传并用典型示范办法扭转了群众只顾眼前利益，忙于织席卖钱而不积极准备种麦的思想，并具体帮助和发动群众克服了地湿难耕及人力、畜力缺乏等困难，结果全村掀起了耕地的热潮，在几天之内将五百多亩早茬地都耕了一遍，接着全部耩上了麦子；另外二百亩晚茬地，也正在往回收割，准备誊好地再种麦。
    在广大干部、群众的一致努力下，目前河北省各地正进入紧张的突击播种阶段，已获得很大的成绩，如邢台专区到十月五日止已完成种麦计划百分之八十二强。但是还有一些干部、群众存有“今年雨水大，种麦不成问题”等麻痹思想，没有抓紧种麦的有利时间。河北日报在十月二日的报道中指出了这个问题，要求各地继续加强具体领导，保证在最短期间全部完成播种任务。
