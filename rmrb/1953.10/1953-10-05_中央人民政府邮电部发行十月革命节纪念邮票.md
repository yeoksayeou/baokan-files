Xinhua News Agency: The commemorative stamps that the Central People's Government Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications planned to print last year to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution will be issued in post offices and telecommunications bureaus across the country starting October 5th this year. This set of commemorative stamps has four designs: One in red depicts a historical painting of the October Revolution – a painting (by V.

Berezov and I. Shagen); one in green is a famous Soviet painting: "The Banner of Our Great Victory - Stalin and Mao Zedong" (by A. Gerasimov); one in blue depicts Soviet communist construction – a majestic statue of Stalin erected at the entrance of the Lenin Canal (sculpted by the Soviet sculptor Vuchetich, photographed by Bartleman). These stamps are all finely printed by intaglio printing and have a face value of 800 yuan each.
