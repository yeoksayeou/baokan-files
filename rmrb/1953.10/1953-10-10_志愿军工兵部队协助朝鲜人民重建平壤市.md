Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th. The engineering corps of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is assisting the Korean government and the Korean people in rebuilding the heroic city of Pyongyang. The projects this unit has already started working on include: restoring the building of the DPRK Cabinet Affairs Bureau, repairing 2,000 rooms of workers' dormitories, rebuilding two kilns and a hospital, and assisting in the reconstruction of a bridge over the Taedong River.

The reconstruction project officially began in early September. The soldiers demonstrated a high degree of internationalism in their work. They said: "It is our glory to assist the Korean people in rebuilding this heroic city. We will definitely build it even more beautifully together with the Korean people." The engineering soldiers braved the heavy rain to transport building materials, clear cement debris, glass shards, and shrapnel from the destroyed buildings, singing happily and shouting work songs. The worksite was busy and lively. Soldiers of the 3rd Company of a certain unit also used their rest days to help a Korean elementary school, thirty li away, to transport wood for building the school buildings; soldiers of another unit also used their rest time to build nineteen thatched houses for the Korean people near their station. The engineering soldiers have recently been assisting in the construction of workers' dormitories at West Pyongyang Station. Once completed, these dormitories can accommodate 2,000 workers and their families.

In the construction project, the engineering soldiers launched the "Cherish Every Inch of Wood and Every Nail in Korea" campaign to save the resources of the Korean people. They made precise calculations when using equipment to avoid any waste. When a certain company lacked iron nails, they cut scrap iron wire mesh into nails to replace them.

    志愿军工兵部队协助朝鲜人民重建平壤市
    【新华社平壤九日电】中国人民志愿军某工兵部队正在协助朝鲜政府和朝鲜人民重建英雄的平壤市。这支部队已经着手进行建设的工程有：恢复朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁事务局大楼，修补工人宿舍二千间，重建窑厂二座、医院一所，和协助在大同江上改建桥梁。
    重建工程在九月初正式开始。战士们在劳动中表现了高度的国际主义精神。他们说：协助朝鲜人民重建这座英雄城市是我们的光荣。我们一定和朝鲜人民一道把它建筑得更加美丽。工兵战士在下雨天冒着大雨搬运建筑器材，清除被毁的建筑物的水泥碎块、玻璃碎片和弹片，兴高采烈地唱着歌，打着号子，作业场上又紧张又热闹。某部第三连的战士们还利用休息日到三十里以外去帮助朝鲜小学校搬运建筑校舍的木料；另一部战士也利用休息时间给驻地附近的朝鲜人民盖了十九间草房。工兵战士们最近又在西平壤车站协助修建工人宿舍。这些宿舍建成后可供二千个工人及其眷属居住。
    在建筑工程中，工兵战士们为了节约朝鲜人民的资源，开展了“爱护朝鲜寸木一钉”运动。他们使用器材时进行精密的计算，以避免有一点浪费。某连在缺乏铁钉时，就把废铁丝网截成钉子来代替。
