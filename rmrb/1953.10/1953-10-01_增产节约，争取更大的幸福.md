    Increase Production and Practice Economy, Strive for Greater Happiness
    By Guo Yu'en, Agricultural Labor Model of Shanxi

    The fourth anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China has arrived, and I feel very happy. In these short four years, the people of our motherland have achieved great victories on all fronts, and this year marks the beginning of the first five-year plan for economic construction. In terms of agricultural production, farmers are gradually moving towards the path of mutual assistance and cooperation. People have already escaped from the suffering of the past. Take Chuandi Village in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, where I live, for example. Now the whole village has risen to the level of middle peasants, 84 percent of the farmers have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives, and the rest have organized two mutual aid teams.

    Our lives have been greatly improved. This year, each member can eat an average of 3.1 dan of grain per year, which is 1.1 dan more than before the War of Resistance Against Japan. With the increase in production, the purchasing power of the members has also greatly increased. In the nine months from spring to now, the village supply and marketing cooperative alone has purchased 468 zhang of various colored city cloth, an average of more than 6 zhang per household; and 35 pieces of agricultural implements. This year, under the correct leadership of the Party branch, the members have been constantly educated in patriotism, internationalism, and the socialist future. In order to strive for another bumper harvest year after continuous bumper harvests, to complete the important task of increasing grain production on the agricultural production front, to further achieve abundant food and clothing, and to strongly support industrial construction and the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the members' enthusiasm for labor has always been high. At the same time, this year the cooperative has implemented a system of year-round contract work and output quotas, which has greatly encouraged the members' enthusiasm for labor. Farming techniques have surpassed any previous year. Therefore, the crops are growing really well. Before the seventh month of the lunar calendar, it was windy when wind was needed, and rainy when rain was needed, it was really a favorable weather. The members were happy to see the vigorous crops and said: With crops like this year, the grain harvested will be really inexhaustible! However, later, unexpectedly, just when the crops were flowering and earing and urgently needed rain, there was a drought, and it didn't rain for nearly two months. The hot sun made the crops bow their heads, and the grains were not full. Fortunately, when it rained in late June, the members bravely fought against the natural disasters, gave full play to the power of organization, and braved the rain to block floods and irrigate more than 100 mu of land. Other crops such as millet and corn, although severely affected by the disaster, due to collective farming and attention to scientific and technological techniques, meticulous farming, this year's yield is also about 30 percent higher than that of neighboring villages. This is really a gratifying thing.

    Farmers have always had the habit of diligence and thrift. After reading the People's Daily editorial published on September 6, "Increase Production, Increase Income, Practice Strict Economy, Tighten Expenditures, and Overfulfill National Plans," everyone unanimously expressed that they would respond to this call with practical actions. Our agricultural producers' cooperative has already rushed to plant 70 mu of wheat fields. We must pay special attention to doing a good job in autumn harvesting and strive not to lose grain or lose less grain. We decided to harvest and thresh as we go, first harvest the mountains, then harvest the plains. By doing so, we can lose at least 1,200 jin less grain than last year this year. At the same time, in order to lay the foundation for next year's bumper harvest, 100 percent of the seeds of various crops in the whole cooperative will be selected in the field, and it is planned to select 3,150 jin of excellent varieties; and we must achieve harvesting one piece and cultivating another, and strive for early cultivation, deep cultivation, and universal cultivation. The three public horses and the members' private livestock of all sizes in the cooperative have been matched into twelve teams, each of which has a dedicated person in charge. This winter, we will rationally organize the surplus labor force to engage in sideline production, planning to earn 5,000 jin of millet to expand reproduction. We must also do a good job in winter manure accumulation. We must turn the more than 6 million yuan of public accumulation funds in the cooperative into active money and use it for expanding reproduction; things that can be done slowly, such as building 80 houses in the five-year plan, can be suspended and done later. The grain stored in the cooperative should be generally dried once to avoid losses. At the same time, we must mobilize every household in the whole cooperative to make a careful plan, and educate male and female members to save grain. The cooperative should continue to implement cost accounting and effectively grasp the income and expenditure plan to avoid blind investment.

    We need relevant departments to provide us with support in production technology, especially in new agricultural implements suitable for mountainous areas and good varieties, fertilizers, and agents. We here are particularly short of water, and the water people drink relies on storing rainwater, so there is still a need to solve the water source problem well. We must produce more grain, plant a large number of trees, and support national economic construction. Only when the country is industrialized can we get greater and more support from the country.

    增产节约，争取更大的幸福
    山西农业劳动模范  郭玉恩
    伟大的中华人民共和国成立四周年来到了，我心里感到非常高兴。在这短短的四个年头里，祖国人民在各个战线上都取得了伟大的胜利，今年已开始了第一个五年计划经济建设。在农业生产方面，农民们正逐渐走向互助合作的道路。人们已经摆脱了过去的苦难日子。就拿我所住的山西省平顺县川底村来说，现在全村已经上升到中农的水平，百分之八十四的农民已经参加了农业生产合作社，其余的组织了两个互助组。
    我们的生活，已经大大地提高了。今年社员们每人每年平均可以吃到三石一斗粮食，比抗日战争以前多一石一斗。随着生产的提高，社员们的购买力也大大提高了。今年春天到现在九个月时间，光在村里供销合作社购买的各色市布就有四百六十八丈，每户平均六丈多；购买农具三十五件。今年在党支部正确领导下，社员们经常不断受到爱国主义、国际主义和社会主义前途的教育。为了争取今年成为连续丰收后的又一个丰收年，在农业生产战线上完成增产粮食的重大任务，进一步做到丰衣足食，有力地支援工业建设和抗美援朝的斗争，社员们的劳动热情始终是高涨的。同时，社内今年实行了常年包工包产制，这样更大大鼓舞了社员们的劳动积极性。耕作技术超过了以往任何一年。因此，庄稼长得实在是好。这里在阴历七月前，要风来风，缺雨落雨，真是风调雨顺。社员们看到了旺盛的庄稼，高兴地说：像今年的庄稼，打下的粮食真吃不完！可是，后来出乎人们意料，正当庄稼扬花出穗急需落雨的时候，天旱了，将近两个月始终没落一点雨，炎热的太阳晒的庄稼低了头，籽粒不饱。好在六月下旬下雨的时候社员们英勇地向自然灾害进行了顽强的斗争，发挥了组织起来的力量，冒着雨堵洪水浇地一百多亩。其他作物如谷子、玉米等，虽然遭受到严重的灾害，但由于集体耕作，讲究了科学技术，耕作细致，今年的产量也比邻村的产量高百分之三十左右。这实在是一件令人高兴的事情。
    农民们素来就有勤俭朴素的习惯。我们看了九月六日人民日报发表的“增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支、超额完成国家计划”的社论后，大家一致表示：要以实际行动响应这个号召。我们农业生产合作社已经抢种了七十亩麦田。我们要特别注意做好秋收工作，争取不丢粮食或少丢粮食。我们决定随黄随收，随割随打，先收山，后收川。照这样做，今年至少可比去年少损失一千二百斤粮食。同时，为了给明年的丰产打下基础，全社各种作物的种籽要百分之百进行田间选种，计划选出优良品种三千一百五十斤；并要做到收一块耕一块，争取早耕、深耕、普耕。社内公共的三匹马和社员私有的大小牲口配成了十二犋，每犋都有专人负责。今年冬季，要合理组织剩余劳力搞副业生产，计划赚五千斤小米，以进行扩大再生产。还要做好冬季积肥工作。要把社内存有的公积金六百多万元变成活钱，用到扩大再生产上去；可以缓办的事情，如五年计划盖房子八十间，就可以暂停实行，以后再办。社内存有的粮食，要普遍晒一次，以免受到损失。同时，要发动全社每户都订一个精打细算的计划，要教育男女社员节约粮食。社内要继续实行成本核算，把收入支出计划切实掌握好，避免盲目投资。
    我们需要有关部门在生产技术上尤其是适合山区的新农具和好的品种、肥料、药剂等方面给我们以支援。我们这里水特别缺，人们吃的水就靠把天上下的雨窖起来使用，因此还需要很好地解决水源问题。我们要多打粮食，大量植树造林，支援国家经济建设。只有国家工业化了，我们才能从国家得到更大更多的支援。
