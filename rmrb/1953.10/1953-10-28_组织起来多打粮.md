Organize to Produce More Grain
Calculated Detailed Accounts, Increased Understanding
Of the seventeen agricultural production cooperatives in Anyang County, Henan Province, fourteen were established this spring. The members of these seventeen cooperatives all received more grain in the autumn harvest. Since the establishment of each cooperative, some members have remained skeptical about its benefits. Some members joined the cooperative but also kept a significant amount of land for their own cultivation, anticipating that if the cooperative's land did not yield a good harvest, their own land would still provide a good yield. In the autumn, each cooperative calculated the annual income of each household and compared it with their income from last year and the income of the surrounding masses, making the members realize the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation. Ma Cunxin, a member of the Ma Fugui Agricultural Production Cooperative, earned 1,695 jin more grain this year than last year. After calculating the detailed accounts, he immediately requested to contribute his reserved land for seed to the cooperative, saying, "My thinking about reserving land was wrong. I will never leave the cooperative."

Collectively Studying Technology, Increasing Output Year After Year
The Wang Weimei Mutual Aid Team in Xuancheng County, Anhui Province, has continuously studied and improved production techniques for the past three years, increasing output year after year. After the Wang Weimei Mutual Aid Team was organized in 1951, it implemented intensive cultivation and increased fertilizer application. The autumn harvest yielded more than 20% higher output than the highest annual output before liberation. The team members then discussed the reasons for the increased production. Everyone agreed that it was the result of the People's Government leading them to organize and implement intensive cultivation. They also realized that if they further developed the spirit of collective research and improved cultivation methods, output would gradually increase. In the spring of 1952, the team members discussed the rice-growing methods in their team by comparing them to Chen Yongkang's experience in high-yield rice production. They found the reasons for the uneven growth, inconsistent maturity, and low yields of the rice they had grown in the past. They then adopted Chen Yongkang's experience, improved the soil, selected seeds, mixed them with water manure, and implemented close planting. As a result, the seedlings grew quickly, the rice matured earlier, the growth was even, and the output increased by 50% compared to 1951. This spring, four households including the individual farmer Bao Nanshan, seeing that the Wang Weimei Mutual Aid Team continuously improved technology and increased output year after year due to being organized, voluntarily requested to join the Wang Weimei Mutual Aid Team. This year, the team further learned technologies such as making "combined seedling beds" and "salt-selecting seeds," which advanced the harvest period. The harvested rice has increased by more than 10% compared to 1952.

Learning from Veteran Farmers
The Xie Yuting Mutual Aid Team in Gaoshan Township, Luxian County, Sichuan Province, mastered advanced techniques such as "good seeds and strong seedlings, sparse seedlings and close planting, and rational fertilization" this year. The autumn harvest resulted in the realization of a 20% increase in production, 5% more than ordinary crops. In production, the team members' production techniques have undergone great changes. Farmers with technical skills actively helped farmers without skills or with poor skills to master the techniques. In the team, Yin Guohua, Yin Shaowu, Li Zhengyou, and others previously did not know how to plow, transplant rice seedlings, or thresh grain. With the patient help of veteran farmers LÃ¼ Qinghe and Wang Kunqian, they were taught in the fields during the day and held meetings in the evening to summarize and improve, so they all learned these skills. Some young farmers progressed faster and were almost as skilled as experienced adults. These young farmers are very grateful and respectful to the veteran farmers. In the mutual aid team, not only did the veteran farmers teach the young farmers the techniques, but they also promoted the veteran farmers to study and improve their techniques together. For example, Wang Kunqian's field had been planted for seventeen years, and the grain had been lodging every year, resulting in diseased seedlings and rotten straw. After the farmers in the team researched and improved the grain seeds, cultivated strong seedlings, sparsely planted them closely, and applied plant ash, the grain grew well and the output increased. Wang Kunqian happily said, "Three cobblers are equal to one Zhuge Liang. The team has many people and many ideas. Problems that have not been solved for many years have been solved by the mutual aid team. The mutual aid team is really good." (Li You)

Same Drought, Different Harvests
The Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chuandi Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, demonstrated the superiority of cooperative mutual aid with facts in the autumn evaluation of the whole township. Although the crops in the area originally grew well, the entire township had been experiencing drought without rain since July, and the harvest generally decreased by 30% to 40%. However, the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative, under the same drought attack, increased production. Their autumn crops averaged 311 jin per mu, 48 jin more than the township average. They had 102 mu of corn that achieved a large-scale increase in production, exceeding the county's increase standard by 61.5%. This year, the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative implemented tillage techniques such as deep plowing to conserve moisture and careful land preparation. During the drought season, they also fully repaired two large canals and carried out flood irrigation, which eventually increased the autumn crop production. During the township's visit and evaluation, the visiting representatives saw that the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative increased production due to being organized with great strength, cultivating well, applying high-quality fertilizers, and focusing on technology. They all expressed that they would learn from them. Some representatives said, "It's not that we don't know the value of the goods, it's just that we're afraid of comparing the goods. The agricultural production cooperative's crops suffered the same drought as ours, but they grew and harvested differently." (Wang Liangyu)

Large-Area Production Increase
The Lai Liuzhen Mutual Aid Team in Rongchang County, Sichuan Province, has achieved a large-area increase in production this year because it has solved production problems and improved production techniques after being organized. The team's rice production increased by more than 30% compared to last year and more than 25% compared to the average annual output. After Lai Liuzhen participated in the provincial agricultural labor model representative meeting this spring, he understood the principle of increasing the yield per unit area and striving for a large-area increase in production. When he returned to the team, he encouraged everyone to grow all the fields well, instead of only pursuing high yields in a few fields. All the team members agreed to this idea, and they all accepted advanced production experiences such as "sparse seedlings and close planting" and "rational fertilization" when planting rice. Also, because the mutual aid team signed a savings and loan contract with the Shuanghe Township branch of the People's Bank of Rongchang County, it was not only convenient to deposit a lot of money in the bank, but also to get loans. This year, the team used these savings and loans to buy enough fertilizer and apply it to the fields, so that the local reclaimed fields no longer needed to be reclaimed, thus ensuring increased production. In addition, mutual assistance in the mutual aid team enabled people with a lack of labor to also achieve a good harvest. For example, Tang Fuzhen, a team member, lacked major labor in her family, so the team members helped her plow the fields, and the output of her fields this year also exceeded the average annual output. The team members are deeply aware that if it were not for the People's Government leading them to organize and support them, they would not have had such a good harvest this year. They are all preparing to use the best grain to pay patriotic public grain, and also to sell grain to the state. (Han Qing)

Played a Leading Role
The Zhang Fugui Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fugui Village, Wendeng County, Shandong Province, suffered a decrease in production due to floods this year, but because they cultivated well, their autumn crops yielded higher than those of ordinary farmers. In the autumn harvest, they gave full play to the effectiveness of being organized. Harvesting, autumn plowing, hoeing radish fields, stripping corn, and other tasks were all done by someone. Under the influence of Zhang Fugui Agricultural Production Cooperative's harvesting and plowing at the same time, the whole village's autumn plowing also started early. Zhang Fugui Agricultural Production Cooperative applied manure and sowed seeds in the wheat fields on time, and the whole village also finished sowing at the autumnal equinox. Now the seedlings have basically emerged completely. However, some villages in neighboring villages did not grasp the autumn plowing and sowing work, and as a result, the uncultivated land became hardened, and the late-sown wheat did not emerge completely. When the people of Fugui Village summed up the wheat work, they all said in unison: Our village is very grateful for the help of the superiors, the agricultural production cooperative took the lead, and the wheat was sown early. We also benefit from the cooperative. It had not rained in the local area for forty days, and the radishes and cabbages of the Zhang Fugui Agricultural Production Cooperative were still growing well because they were watered on time. Zhang Fugui said, "Without a cooperative, the wheat may not have been sown on time, who would have the time to water the radishes."
