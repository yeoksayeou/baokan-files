Organize to Produce More Grain
Calculated Detailed Accounts, Increased Understanding
Of the seventeen agricultural production cooperatives in Anyang County, Henan Province, fourteen were established this spring. The members of these seventeen cooperatives all received more grain in the autumn harvest. Since the establishment of each cooperative, some members have remained skeptical about its benefits. Some members joined the cooperative but also kept a significant amount of land for their own cultivation, anticipating that if the cooperative's land did not yield a good harvest, their own land would still provide a good yield. In the autumn, each cooperative calculated the annual income of each household and compared it with their income from last year and the income of the surrounding masses, making the members realize the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation. Ma Cunxin, a member of the Ma Fugui Agricultural Production Cooperative, earned 1,695 jin more grain this year than last year. After calculating the detailed accounts, he immediately requested to contribute his reserved land for seed to the cooperative, saying, "My thinking about reserving land was wrong. I will never leave the cooperative."

Collectively Studying Technology, Increasing Output Year After Year
The Wang Weimei Mutual Aid Team in Xuancheng County, Anhui Province, has continuously studied and improved production techniques for the past three years, increasing output year after year. After the Wang Weimei Mutual Aid Team was organized in 1951, it implemented intensive cultivation and increased fertilizer application. The autumn harvest yielded more than 20% higher output than the highest annual output before liberation. The team members then discussed the reasons for the increased production. Everyone agreed that it was the result of the People's Government leading them to organize and implement intensive cultivation. They also realized that if they further developed the spirit of collective research and improved cultivation methods, output would gradually increase. In the spring of 1952, the team members discussed the rice-growing methods in their team by comparing them to Chen Yongkang's experience in high-yield rice production. They found the reasons for the uneven growth, inconsistent maturity, and low yields of the rice they had grown in the past. They then adopted Chen Yongkang's experience, improved the soil, selected seeds, mixed them with water manure, and implemented close planting. As a result, the seedlings grew quickly, the rice matured earlier, the growth was even, and the output increased by 50% compared to 1951. This spring, four households including the individual farmer Bao Nanshan, seeing that the Wang Weimei Mutual Aid Team continuously improved technology and increased output year after year due to being organized, voluntarily requested to join the Wang Weimei Mutual Aid Team. This year, the team further learned technologies such as making "combined seedling beds" and "salt-selecting seeds," which advanced the harvest period. The harvested rice has increased by more than 10% compared to 1952.

Learning from Veteran Farmers
The Xie Yuting Mutual Aid Team in Gaoshan Township, Luxian County, Sichuan Province, mastered advanced techniques such as "good seeds and strong seedlings, sparse seedlings and close planting, and rational fertilization" this year. The autumn harvest resulted in the realization of a 20% increase in production, 5% more than ordinary crops. In production, the team members' production techniques have undergone great changes. Farmers with technical skills actively helped farmers without skills or with poor skills to master the techniques. In the team, Yin Guohua, Yin Shaowu, Li Zhengyou, and others previously did not know how to plow, transplant rice seedlings, or thresh grain. With the patient help of veteran farmers Lü Qinghe and Wang Kunqian, they were taught in the fields during the day and held meetings in the evening to summarize and improve, so they all learned these skills. Some young farmers progressed faster and were almost as skilled as experienced adults. These young farmers are very grateful and respectful to the veteran farmers. In the mutual aid team, not only did the veteran farmers teach the young farmers the techniques, but they also promoted the veteran farmers to study and improve their techniques together. For example, Wang Kunqian's field had been planted for seventeen years, and the grain had been lodging every year, resulting in diseased seedlings and rotten straw. After the farmers in the team researched and improved the grain seeds, cultivated strong seedlings, sparsely planted them closely, and applied plant ash, the grain grew well and the output increased. Wang Kunqian happily said, "Three cobblers are equal to one Zhuge Liang. The team has many people and many ideas. Problems that have not been solved for many years have been solved by the mutual aid team. The mutual aid team is really good." (Li You)

Same Drought, Different Harvests
The Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chuandi Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, demonstrated the superiority of cooperative mutual aid with facts in the autumn evaluation of the whole township. Although the crops in the area originally grew well, the entire township had been experiencing drought without rain since July, and the harvest generally decreased by 30% to 40%. However, the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative, under the same drought attack, increased production. Their autumn crops averaged 311 jin per mu, 48 jin more than the township average. They had 102 mu of corn that achieved a large-scale increase in production, exceeding the county's increase standard by 61.5%. This year, the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative implemented tillage techniques such as deep plowing to conserve moisture and careful land preparation. During the drought season, they also fully repaired two large canals and carried out flood irrigation, which eventually increased the autumn crop production. During the township's visit and evaluation, the visiting representatives saw that the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative increased production due to being organized with great strength, cultivating well, applying high-quality fertilizers, and focusing on technology. They all expressed that they would learn from them. Some representatives said, "It's not that we don't know the value of the goods, it's just that we're afraid of comparing the goods. The agricultural production cooperative's crops suffered the same drought as ours, but they grew and harvested differently." (Wang Liangyu)

Large-Area Production Increase
The Lai Liuzhen Mutual Aid Team in Rongchang County, Sichuan Province, has achieved a large-area increase in production this year because it has solved production problems and improved production techniques after being organized. The team's rice production increased by more than 30% compared to last year and more than 25% compared to the average annual output. After Lai Liuzhen participated in the provincial agricultural labor model representative meeting this spring, he understood the principle of increasing the yield per unit area and striving for a large-area increase in production. When he returned to the team, he encouraged everyone to grow all the fields well, instead of only pursuing high yields in a few fields. All the team members agreed to this idea, and they all accepted advanced production experiences such as "sparse seedlings and close planting" and "rational fertilization" when planting rice. Also, because the mutual aid team signed a savings and loan contract with the Shuanghe Township branch of the People's Bank of Rongchang County, it was not only convenient to deposit a lot of money in the bank, but also to get loans. This year, the team used these savings and loans to buy enough fertilizer and apply it to the fields, so that the local reclaimed fields no longer needed to be reclaimed, thus ensuring increased production. In addition, mutual assistance in the mutual aid team enabled people with a lack of labor to also achieve a good harvest. For example, Tang Fuzhen, a team member, lacked major labor in her family, so the team members helped her plow the fields, and the output of her fields this year also exceeded the average annual output. The team members are deeply aware that if it were not for the People's Government leading them to organize and support them, they would not have had such a good harvest this year. They are all preparing to use the best grain to pay patriotic public grain, and also to sell grain to the state. (Han Qing)

Played a Leading Role
The Zhang Fugui Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fugui Village, Wendeng County, Shandong Province, suffered a decrease in production due to floods this year, but because they cultivated well, their autumn crops yielded higher than those of ordinary farmers. In the autumn harvest, they gave full play to the effectiveness of being organized. Harvesting, autumn plowing, hoeing radish fields, stripping corn, and other tasks were all done by someone. Under the influence of Zhang Fugui Agricultural Production Cooperative's harvesting and plowing at the same time, the whole village's autumn plowing also started early. Zhang Fugui Agricultural Production Cooperative applied manure and sowed seeds in the wheat fields on time, and the whole village also finished sowing at the autumnal equinox. Now the seedlings have basically emerged completely. However, some villages in neighboring villages did not grasp the autumn plowing and sowing work, and as a result, the uncultivated land became hardened, and the late-sown wheat did not emerge completely. When the people of Fugui Village summed up the wheat work, they all said in unison: Our village is very grateful for the help of the superiors, the agricultural production cooperative took the lead, and the wheat was sown early. We also benefit from the cooperative. It had not rained in the local area for forty days, and the radishes and cabbages of the Zhang Fugui Agricultural Production Cooperative were still growing well because they were watered on time. Zhang Fugui said, "Without a cooperative, the wheat may not have been sown on time, who would have the time to water the radishes."

    组织起来多打粮
    算了细账，提高了认识
    河南省安阳县十七个农业生产合作社中，有十四个社是在今年春天建立的。这十七个社的社员在秋收中都多分了粮食。各个社自建立以来，部分社员对它的好处还是半信半疑，有的社员一边入社，一边还留了不少地自己种，预防社里的地收成不好时，自己的地里还有好收成。秋季，各社计算出了各户的全年收入，再把各户的全年收入和他去年的收入及周围群众的收入进行对比，使社员们都认识到互助合作的好处。马富贵农业生产合作社社员马存信，今年的粮食收入比去年多了一千六百九十五斤。算过细账后，当时他就要求把自己留种的土地入到社里，他说：“我留地的思想不对，以后说啥我也不出社啦。”
    集体研究技术，产量年年提高
    安徽省宣城县汪为美互助组，三年来不断研究改进生产技术，产量一年比一年提高。汪为美互助组在一九五一年组织起来后，实行精耕细作，增施肥料，在秋收中的产量比解放前的最高年产量增产二成以上。组员当时就讨论了增产的原因，大家一致认为，这是人民政府领导他们组织起来，实行深耕细作的结果，同时认识到，如果再进一步发挥集体研究的精神，改进耕作方法，产量还会逐步提高。一九五二年春天，组员根据陈永康水稻丰产的经验，对照自己组里的种植方法进行讨论，找出了以往种的稻子生长不齐，成熟不一致，收成不多的原因。他们当时就接受了陈永康的经验，进行改良土壤、选种、拌匀水粪，并实行了小株密植，结果，那年秧苗发棵快，稻子成熟早，生长又整齐，比一九五一年又增产五成。今年春天，单干农民鲍南山等四户，看到汪为美互助组因组织起来不断改进技术，产量年年提高，便自动要求参加了汪为美互助组。今年组里又进一步学习了做“合式秧田”、“盐选种”等技术，使收割期又提早了，已收的稻子比一九五二年又增产一成多。
    向老农请教
    四川省泸县高山乡谢玉廷互助组，今年掌握了“好种壮秧，少秧密栽，合理施肥”的先进技术，秋收结果，增产百分之二十的计划实现了，比一般的庄稼增产百分之五。在生产中，组员们的生产技术起了很大变化，组里有技术的农民积极帮助没有技术或技术不好的农民掌握技术。组里殷国华、尹绍武、李正有等，过去都不会犁田、栽秧、打谷等主要生产技术，经过老农吕清和、王坤乾等的耐心帮助，白天在田里教，晚上又开会总结提高，使他们都学会了。有的青年农民比较进步快，和早有技术的成年人差不多了。这些青年农民都很感激和尊敬老农。在互助组中，不但老农教会了青年农民技术，也促进了老农在一起互相研究提高技术。如王坤乾的一块田，过去种了十七年，谷子年年倒伏，挞生秧谷子，收烂谷草；经组里农民研究以后，实行改良谷种，培育壮秧，少秧密栽，下草木灰，结果谷子长好了，产量提高。王坤乾高兴地说：“三个臭皮匠，顶个诸葛亮，组里人多办法多，多年没有解决的问题，互助组也把它解决了，互助组硬是好。”    （李由）
    一样受旱，两样收成
    山西平顺县川底村郭玉恩农业生产合作社在全乡秋季评比中，以事实显示了合作互助的优越性。当地庄稼原来虽然长得很好，但全乡从七月起一直干旱无雨，收成一般减产三成到四成。而郭玉恩农业生产合作社，在同样的干旱袭击下，却增产了。他们的秋季作物，平均每亩产量三百一十一斤，比全乡平均每亩产量多收四十八斤；他们有一百零二亩玉米获得大面积增产，超过全县增产标准百分之六十一点五。郭玉恩农业生产合作社今年实行了深耕保墒，精细整地等耕作技术，在干旱季节又全力修好了两条大渠，进行了洪浇，使秋庄稼终于增产。在全乡参观评比中，参观代表们看到郭玉恩农业生产合作社，由于组织起来力量大、耕作好、下的肥多质高、讲技术而增产的情形，都表示要向他们学习。有的代表说：“不怕不识货，只怕货比货，农业生产合作社庄稼和我们的庄稼一样受旱，但长的收的却是两个样。”（王良玉）
    大面积增产
    四川省荣昌县赖流贞互助组，因为组织起来以后解决了生产中的困难，改进了生产技术，今年得到了大面积增产。全组水稻比去年增产三成多，比常年产量增产二成半以上。赖流贞在今年春天参加了省农业劳动模范代表会以后，懂得了提高单位面积产量，争取大面积增产的道理，回到组里就鼓励大家要把所有的田都种好，不要光追求少数田的高额产量。全组组员都同意这个意见，种水稻都接受了“少秧密栽”“合理施肥”等先进生产经验。又因为互助组和人民银行荣昌县双河乡营业所订了储贷合同，不但在银行存了许多款，而且向银行贷款也大感方便，今年该组就用这些存款和贷款，买了足够的肥料，下到田里，使当地翻硝的田不再翻硝，因而保证了增产。此外，互助组里彼此互助，使缺乏劳动力的人也得到了好收成。如组员唐福贞家里缺乏主要劳动力，组员就帮助她犁田，她的田的产量今年也超过常年产量。组员们都深刻认识到，如果不是人民政府领导他们组织起来，扶助他们，就不会有今年这样的好收成。他们都准备用最好的谷子缴爱国公粮，还要把粮食卖给国家。    （汗青）
    起了带头作用
    山东文登县富贵村张富贵农业生产合作社，今年虽然遭了涝灾减了产，但因为他们耕作得好，秋季作物比一般农民的产量还高。在秋收中，他们充分发挥了组织起来的效能，秋收、秋耕、锄萝卜地、剥玉米等活，件件都有人干。在张富贵农业生产合作社边收边耕的影响下，全村的秋耕也随之早动了手。张富贵农业生产合作社按时在麦地上了粪，下了种，全村也在秋分时种完。现在出苗基本上齐全。可是邻村有的村不抓紧秋耕秋种工作，结果没有耕的地都硬了，晚种的麦子也没有出齐。富贵村的群众在总结小麦工作时，都异口同声地说：咱村多亏上级帮助，农业生产合作社带头，把麦子早种上了，有了合作社咱也沾光。当地四十天没有下雨，张富贵农业生产合作社的萝卜、白菜因为按时浇了水，仍旧长得好。张富贵说：“不办社，麦子也不一定能按时种上，谁还有工夫浇萝卜。”
