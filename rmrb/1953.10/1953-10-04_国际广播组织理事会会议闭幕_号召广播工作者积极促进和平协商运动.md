Xinhua News Agency report: The 24th Council Meeting and the 9th Technical Committee Meeting of the International Broadcasting Organization were held in Beijing from September 15th to October 2nd. The meeting was presided over by Mei Yi, Chairman of the Council of the International Broadcasting Organization and Director of the Central Broadcasting Administration of China.

The full text of the communique issued after the meeting is as follows:

"The 24th Council of the International Broadcasting Organization, comprising the broadcasting institutions of eighteen countries in Europe and Asia, was held in Beijing from September 15th to October 2nd, 1953, under the chairmanship of the organization's chairman, Mei Yi.

The meeting reviewed and discussed: the report on the activities of the International Broadcasting Organization; the draft program activities of the International Broadcasting Organization for 1954; the report of the Romanian People's Republic Broadcasting Committee on the work carried out during the Fourth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship in Bucharest; and certain organizational issues.

The 24th Council adopted resolutions on the reports it heard, striving to expand international cooperation in broadcasting and television, and to comply with international agreements in this regard.

The meeting unanimously adopted the proposal of the People's Republic of China delegation to support the World Peace Council's recommendation to launch a worldwide movement aimed at easing international tensions and resolving international disputes peacefully, as this movement is in the vital interests of the people of all countries. At the same time, the Council called on all broadcasters to actively participate in and promote the development of this movement, exposing the forces of aggression and war through broadcasting, as they are trying to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement, incite hatred among nations, and prepare and launch a new world war.

The Council further pointed out that the International Telecommunication Union, under pressure from the US representatives, continues to refuse the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in its various bodies and meetings, and continues to pursue an intolerable policy of discrimination against them. This abnormal situation is contrary to the aims and tasks pursued by the International Telecommunication Union. It is causing irreparable damage to the resolution of international telecommunications issues through cooperation between the peoples of all countries, undermining the prestige of the International Telecommunication Union and reducing its international significance.

Regarding this issue, the Council, in its resolution, drew the attention of the International Telecommunication Union to the need for the Union to take practical measures to eliminate this unacceptable situation in order to facilitate effective cooperation between countries in the field of telecommunications and to consolidate peace and the security of all peoples.

The Council also unanimously decided that the International Broadcasting Organization Technical Center should provide fraternal assistance to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in rebuilding the broadcasting services destroyed by the interventionists, by means of consultation and the supply of recording programs.

Based on the information provided by the International Broadcasting Organization Technical Center, the meeting considered that the occupying authorities of the United States, Britain, and France were indeed continuing to violate the European Broadcasting Agreement and the frequency allocation plan (Copenhagen Plan) in the annexes to this agreement by illegally using 123 radio transmitters on 78 channels. This behavior has caused serious damage to millions of radio listeners in Europe, preventing them from making normal use of radio, a powerful cultural tool. The Council unanimously called for a halt to this destructive behavior, mainly taken by the US occupying authorities, and drew the attention of the International Telecommunication Union to the need for the Union to take effective measures to establish order in the airwaves and to ensure compliance with the European Broadcasting Agreement jointly signed by twenty-five European countries.

At the same time, the Council considered that the work of the International Broadcasting Organization Technical Center had indeed made progress, and that a series of measures had been drawn up to expand the monitoring work carried out by the station, in particular to expand the monitoring work in the medium and long wave bands.

Simultaneous with the 24th Council Meeting, the 9th Technical Committee Meeting of the International Broadcasting Organization was held, at which various pressing issues in broadcasting and television technology were studied, and specialized reports made by experts from member countries were discussed (including 'Results of Medium and Long Wave Band Monitoring in Europe,' 'Modern Color Television Systems,' 'On Rural Wired Broadcasting Systems,' etc.). A series of recommendations were put forward in order to promote the further development and improvement of broadcasting and television technology in member countries.

The meeting pointed out that the Technical Committee of the International Broadcasting Organization has achieved significant results in its work by relying on extensive cooperation among member countries in broadcasting and television technology, thus benefiting international cooperation in practice.

The Technical Committee also reviewed the work plan for 1954. According to this plan, the committee's activities will be further developed.

In accordance with the provisions of the organization's charter, the 24th Council elected Luo Gadomski, the representative of the Polish Broadcasting Committee (Polish Radio), as the Chairman of the International Broadcasting Organization for 1954, and elected Pozdnyak, the representative of Soviet Radio, and Mei Yi, the representative of the Chinese Broadcasting Organization, as Vice-Chairmen.

The Technical Committee elected Ka. Ya. Star, the representative of the Czechoslovak Broadcasting Organization, as the Chairman of the Technical Committee for 1954-1955.

    国际广播组织理事会会议闭幕
    号召广播工作者积极促进和平协商运动
    据新华社讯：国际广播组织理事会第二十四次会议和技术委员会第九次会议，已于九月十五日至十月二日在北京举行。会议由国际广播组织理事会主席、中国广播事业局局长梅益主持。
    会议结束后发表的公报全文如下：
    “拥有欧亚两洲十八国广播机构的国际广播组织第二十四次理事会，在本组织主席梅益主持之下，已于一九五三年九月十五日至十月二日在北京举行。
    本次会议审查并讨论了：关于国际广播组织活动的报告；国际广播组织一九五四年的节目活动草案；罗马尼亚人民共和国广播委员会关于布加勒斯特第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节时所进行的工作报告以及某些组织问题。
    第二十四次理事会，就其所听取的报告通过了各项决议，用以尽力扩大广播与电视的国际合作，并遵守这一方面的国际协定。
    本次会议一致通过了中华人民共和国代表团所提支持世界和平理事会关于展开旨在缓和国际局势而以和平方式解决国际争端的世界性运动的建议，因为这一运动符合于世界各国人民的切身利益。同时，本次理事会号召所有广播工作者积极参加并促进这一运动的开展，通过广播揭露侵略和战争势力，因为它们正在力图破坏朝鲜停战协定，燃起各民族间的仇恨，借以准备并发动新的世界战争。
    本次理事会继而指出，国际电讯联盟在美国代表的压力下，仍在拒绝中华人民共和国合法代表参加其各种机构与会议，而对之继续奉行令人不能容忍的歧视政策。此种反常情况，是和国际电讯联盟所追求的目的与任务相违背的，它正在对通过各国人民间的合作以解决国际电讯问题造成不可弥补的损害，破坏着国际电讯联盟的威信并降低其国际意义。
    关于这一问题理事会在其决议中曾提请国际电讯联盟注意，该联盟有必要采取实际措施消除此种不可容许之情况，以利各国在电讯方面之有效合作，并巩固和平与各族人民的安全。
    理事会并一致决议，由国际广播组织技术中心站采用咨询及供给录音节目等方式，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国重建为干涉者所破坏的广播事业的工作中，给予兄弟般的援助。
    根据国际广播组织技术中心站所提供的资料，本次会议认为美、英、法国占领当局确有在七十八个频道上，非法使用一百二十三部广播机，继续破坏欧洲广播协定，以及这一协定之附件中、长波波段周率分配计划（哥本哈根计划）的行为。此种行为给欧洲千百万广播听众带来了严重的损害，妨碍他们正常地利用广播这一强而有力的文化工具。理事会一致要求制止此种主要由美国占领当局所采取的破坏行为，并提请国际电讯联盟注意，该联盟有必要采取有效措施，以建立空中秩序，并使欧洲二十五个国家所共同签订之欧洲广播协定得到遵守。
    同时理事会认为，国际广播组织技术中心站的工作确有进展，并已拟定一系列的措施，以扩大该站所进行之收测工作，其中特别要扩大中、长波波段的收测工作。
    与第二十四次理事会同时，举行了国际广播组织第九次技术委员会会议，会上对广播技术及电视技术方面各项迫切问题进行了研究，并讨论各会员国专家所作的专题报告（其中有‘关于欧洲中、长波波段收测结果’，‘现代有色电视系统’，‘谈农村有线广播的系统’等篇）后，提出一系列的建议，以期促进各会员国广播技术与电视技术的进一步发展与改善。
    本次会议指出，国际广播组织技术委员会在其工作中依靠各会员国在广播技术与电视技术方面的广泛合作，已获得了显著的成就，因而在实践上有益于国际合作。
    本次技术委员会也审查了一九五四年的工作计划。根据这一计划，委员会的活动会得到进一步的开展。
    第二十四次理事会根据本组织章程的规定，已选举波兰广播委员会（波兰电台）的代表罗·加多姆斯基担任国际广播组织一九五四年度的主席，选举苏联电台的代表波兹德尼亚克及中国广播组织的代表梅益担任副主席。
    此次技术委员会已选举捷克斯洛伐克广播组织的代表卡·雅·斯塔尔担任技术委员会一九五四年至一九五五年的主席。
