Xinhua News Agency, November 11th, Bombay Dispatch: Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech in Bombay on the 9th, addressing the issue of prisoner of war repatriation following the Korean armistice.

Prime Minister Nehru stated that South Korea has never concealed its intention to continue the war in Korea. "But others do not openly state this," he said. Recent developments in Korea have created certain complex situations, indicating that some countries do not wish to end the Korean War peacefully. Nehru condemned the Syngman Rhee government's threats to use force against the Indian custodial forces and to seize non-directly repatriated prisoners of war. He said, "The South Korean government, which so frequently violates solemn obligations, is extremely irresponsible." He said, "The South Korean government has shamefully violated the armistice agreement. Only four days after the armistice agreement was signed, it released 23,000 prisoners of war. These prisoners of war should have been handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. This is not only a shameful act by the South Korean government, but also an act that should be condemned and is dishonorable. We have never trusted the words of the South Korean government. We have never trusted them, and we never will. But the United Nations is a responsible body." Nehru said, "The United Nations and the United States have guaranteed to protect us. But now a situation has arisen that makes us feel difficult."

Prime Minister Nehru emphasized that regardless of what South Korea does, other members of the United Nations—especially the United States, which bears the greatest responsibility in the Korean War—should be responsible for fulfilling all the terms of the armistice agreement. Nehru said, "The 'United Nations Command' in Korea must frankly and publicly condemn the South Korean government's wrongdoings." He believes that the United Nations and the countries that have troops stationed in Korea "must state that they will not allow the South Koreans to carry out their threats." Nehru said, "I cannot understand why there is fear in pointing out South Korea's situation to make it understand." Nehru pointed out that South Korea's army was built up with "money given to them by others," and this army is under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Command.

In his speech, Nehru elaborated on the various problems faced by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. He said that when the custodial forces arrived in Korea and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission established its headquarters, it found that the "explanation houses" were not ready and hoped to build new ones. The United Nations Command hoped to take 41 days to build the houses, while the commission hoped to complete them within four days. The time for interviewing 25,000 prisoners of war was only 90 days. If 41 days were spent building the houses, then only 50 days would be left. Therefore, a request was made to extend the 90-day time limit. The United Nations Command did not accept this request. They were not prepared to reply immediately, and as the days passed, the situation became even more serious.

The Indian Prime Minister said, "It is strange that the United Nations Command neither agreed to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's suggestion to extend the end date of the explanation period, nor prepared to build the facilities for explaining to the prisoners of war. The United Nations Command is now informing the chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission that it will need 41 days to provide the facilities. This is not right. You should either provide the facilities immediately, or extend the time, because you are very likely to say after some time: Now the explanation time is over."

Nehru said that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has told the United Nations Command that if the United Nations Command believes that the requests for a three-month extension of the time limit and the construction of new explanation houses are unacceptable, then the commission's presence here is futile.

Nehru said that the prisoners of war are under threat and therefore cannot express their desire for repatriation. He said, "If it is believed that all these prisoners of war are truly refusing to return to their own country, then it would be meaningless to spend six months discussing the issue of explanation." "These prisoners of war may be refusing repatriation under threat and fear, and the explanation work is to eliminate any fear and misunderstanding they may have. It has been proven that approximately 103 prisoners of war have told the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission that they have been threatened by the prisoners of war who are with them, who told them that if they agree to return to their country, they will be killed."

Prime Minister Nehru questioned: If the United Nations Command claims that the majority of the 22,500 prisoners of war have decided not to go home, then what is the purpose of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission? "And if the prisoners of war have decided that they oppose repatriation unless by force or coercion, then why don't they dare to tell the commission their decision?"

Nehru pointed out that the task of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is to give the prisoners of war every opportunity to express their free will without any external influence or threat. Nehru said that as for the prisoners of war, they are always very eager to cause trouble. They are ready to riot at any time. Nehru said he does not know what discipline "the United Nations Command has taught them." Some prisoners of war secretly came to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission without the knowledge of other prisoners of war and said they wanted to go home, but the other prisoners of war in the camp stopped them. Nehru said, "Clearly, some prisoners of war have been threatened or pressured. If this threat continues, then the commission will not be able to play any role. In that case, there is no need for us to be there. The whole arrangement will become a farce."

Nehru said that recently "a very important figure" in the United States used the words "so-called neutral nations" when talking about the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. He makes one doubt whether the member states of the commission are truly neutral. This shows a certain degree of narrow-mindedness towards the work of people who are performing their duties in accordance with pre-determined principles and rules.

(Editor's Note: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said at a press conference on the 6th that "the United States is not happy with all the actions taken by the so-called neutral nations commission in Korea.") Nehru said, "We are not afraid of threats. As long as we can continue, we will continue to do our work impartially. This is a time of testing for the United Nations." Prime Minister Nehru said that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is absolutely neutral. He said, "When we are working sincerely and trying to fulfill our responsibilities, we are called 'so-called neutral nations.' This is unfortunate."

Nehru said that the United Nations is facing a serious test, and it must clearly declare whether the Korean armistice and the appointment of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission are "a joke and just for show."

    印度总理尼赫鲁在孟买发表演说
    要求美方履行停战协定各项条款
    【新华社十一日讯】孟买消息：印度总理尼赫鲁九日在孟买发表演说，谈及朝鲜停战后的战俘遣返问题。
    尼赫鲁总理说，南朝鲜从未隐讳它在朝鲜继续进行战争的打算。“但是别人并不公开道出这一点。”他说，朝鲜最近情势的发展引起了某些错综复杂的情况，这些情况表明：某些国家并不希望以和平方式结束朝鲜战争。尼赫鲁斥责李承晚政府要以武力对付印度看管部队和劫夺不直接遣返的战俘的威胁。他说：“这样经常地破坏庄严的义务的南朝鲜政府是极端不负责任的”。他说：“南朝鲜政府已可耻地破坏了停战协定。仅仅在停战协定签字之后四天，他就释放了二万三千名战俘。这些战俘是应该交给中立国遣返委员会的。这不但是南朝鲜政府的可耻的行为，而且这种行为是应该受到谴责的，是不名誉的。我们对南朝鲜政府的言论从来就不信任的。我们从来就不信赖他们，也从来不信任他们。但是联合国是一个负责的机构。”尼赫鲁说：“联合国和美国曾保证要保护我们。但是现在产生了使我们感觉困难的情况。”
    尼赫鲁总理强调说：不管南朝鲜怎样，联合国的其他会员国——特别是在朝鲜战争中负最大责任的美国——应负责履行停战协定的各项条款。尼赫鲁说：在朝鲜的“联军司令部必须坦白地出来公开斥责南朝鲜政府的错误行为”。他认为联合国和在朝鲜派有部队的国家“必须表示：它们将不允许南朝鲜人把他们的威胁付诸实施”。尼赫鲁说：“我不能理解：为什么怕向南朝鲜指出而使它了解它的处境。”尼赫鲁指出，南朝鲜的军队，是靠“别人给他们出钱”而建立起来的，这支军队是在联合国军司令部的管辖之下。
    尼赫鲁在演说中就中立国遣返委员会所面临的各种问题作了详细的论述。他说：当看管部队抵达朝鲜，中立国遣返委员会设立了它的总部之后，它发现“解释房屋”尚未就绪并希望修建新的房屋。联合国军司令部希望用四十一天的时间来修建房屋，而委员会则希望在四天之内修建完毕。询问二万五千名战俘的时间仅有九十天。如果用四十天的时间来修建房屋，那么就只剩下五十天了。于是就提出来延长九十天的时限的要求。联合国军司令部没有接受这个要求。他们不准备立刻答复，而日子一天一天地过去，使得情况就更为严重。
    印度总理说：“令人奇怪的是：联合国军司令部既不同意中立国遣返委员会提出的要求延长解释期限的结束日期的建议，而且也不筹备修建向战俘进行解释的种种设备。联合国军司令部现在通知中立国遣返委员会主席说：它将需要四十一天的时间才能提供种种设备。这是不对的。你们要末应该立即提供设备，要末就得延长时间，因为你们过一些时候之后很可能这样说：现在解释的时间已经完了。”
    尼赫鲁说，中立国遣返委员会已告诉联合国军司令部说，如果联合国军司令部认为延长为时三个月的时限和修建新的解释房屋这些要求都是不能接受的话，那么委员会来到这里是徒劳无益的。
    尼赫鲁说到了战俘们处于威胁之下因而不能表示遣返愿望。他说：“如果认为所有这些战俘都是真正拒绝回到自己的祖国去的，那么花费六个月的时间来讨论解释问题，将是毫无意义的事了。”“这些战俘可能是在威胁与恐惧下才拒绝遣返的，而解释工作就是要消除他们可能有的任何畏惧心理与误解。已经证明：大约有一百零三名战俘曾告诉中立国遣返委员会说：他们曾受到和他们在一起的战俘们的威胁，这些和他们在一起的战俘告诉他们说：假如他们同意返回祖国去，那么他们将遭到杀害。”
    尼赫鲁总理质问道：如果联合国军司令部声称二万二千五百名战俘中的大多数已经决定不回家，那么中立国遣返委员会的目的是干什么呢？“而且假使战俘们已经决定，要是不用武力或强迫，他们就反对遣返，那末他们为什么不敢向委员会说出他们的决定呢？”
    尼赫鲁指出：中立国遣返委员会的任务是给与战俘一切机会在没有外界的任何影响或威胁之下表示他的自由意志。尼赫鲁说，至于战俘们，他们总是极想找麻烦的。他们随时准备骚动。尼赫鲁说，他不知道“联合国军司令部曾经教导他们”什么纪律。有些战俘不让其他战俘知道而偷偷地来到中立国遣返委员会说他们希望回家，但战俘营中的其他战俘阻止他们。尼赫鲁说，“很明显，有人曾对某些战俘进行威胁或施加压力。如果这种威胁继续下去的话，那末委员会将不能起什么作用。那样的话，就无需要我们到那里去。整个安排将成为一幕滑稽戏。”
    尼赫鲁说最近美国的“一位很重要的人物”谈到中立国遣返委员会时曾用“所谓中立国”那样的话。他使人怀疑委员会的成员国究竟是否是真正中立的。这表明对依照事先规定的原则和规则执行他们的任务的人们的工作表示某种程度的偏狭的态度。
    （编者按：美国国务卿杜勒斯六日曾在记者招待会上说，“美国对在朝鲜的所谓中立国委员会所采取的一切行动，并不感到愉快”。）尼赫鲁说：“我们不怕威胁。只要我们能够继续下去，我们将继续不偏不倚地做我们的工作。这是一个对联合国考验的时期。”尼赫鲁总理说：中立国遣返委员会是绝对中立的。他说：“当我们正在诚心诚意地工作而设法尽我们的责任时，我们被称作‘所谓中立国’。这是不幸的。”
    尼赫鲁说：联合国正面临着严重的考验，它必须明确声明：朝鲜的停战以及任命组成中立国遣返委员会一事是不是“在开玩笑和仅仅是做做样子”。
