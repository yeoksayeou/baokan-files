    "Sunan" and "Yixin" Private Pen Shops Are Being Dealt With for Deceiving Customers

    Reader Yang Wu writes: The "Sunan" and "Yixin" private pen shops in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, recently printed tens of thousands of advertisements under the guise of pen factories and mailed them to government agencies, military units, industrial and mining enterprises, and other organizations across the country. The advertisements were exquisitely printed and filled with pleasant phrases. In reality, these two shops have no factories or machines. The pens they sell are assembled from various parts, their quality is very poor, but the price is much higher than the market price. For example, one type of pen called the "Type 61 Gold Pen" sells for 240,000 yuan per dozen; while pens of the same quality sell for only 141,000 yuan a dozen in other local stores. Many people have been deceived into sending money by mail order after seeing the advertisements. According to my understanding, there are no less than 10,000 people. For example, comrades from the Zhuji County Tax Bureau in Zhejiang Province ordered a dozen pens after seeing the advertisement, but to their surprise, eight of them were damaged after only eight days of use. When they wrote to negotiate, their request was ignored.

    After receiving "Five-Anti" education, the "Sunan" and "Yixin" private pen shops still fail to abide by government laws and actively engage in legitimate business. Instead, they are driven by profit and use deceptive means. This is a blatant illegal act, and the local industrial and commercial departments must deal with it.

    Editor's note: This newspaper has received more than a dozen letters from readers exposing the above-mentioned incident. The Suzhou Municipal People's Government Administration for Industry and Commerce has also received more than 300 letters of exposure from deceived units. Currently, the Suzhou Municipal People's Government Administration for Industry and Commerce is handling this incident and has ordered the two shops to make public self-criticisms in the Shanghai "Liberation Daily" and the Tianjin "Ta Kung Pao."

### “苏南”、“益新”两家私营钢笔店欺骗顾客的行为正进行处理

专栏：读者来信摘要

    “苏南”、“益新”两家私营钢笔店欺骗顾客的行为正进行处理
    读者杨吾来信：江苏省苏州市“苏南”、“益新”两家私营钢笔商店，最近冒用笔厂名义印了几万份广告，分寄全国各地机关、部队、工矿企业等单位。广告印得十分精致漂亮，上面写着一派动听的词句。实际上这两家商店既没有工厂、又没有机器，所出售的钢笔是把各种零件搭配装成，质量很坏，售价却比市价高得多。如其中有一种名叫“六十一型金笔”的钢笔，每打售二十四万元；而同样质量的钢笔在当地其他店里只卖十四万一打。看了广告后受骗汇款函购的人很多，仅据我所了解，就不下一万人。如浙江诸暨县税务局的同志看了广告后函购了一打钢笔，不料用了八天就损坏了八只，写信去交涉，结果是置之不理。
    在经过“五反”教育后，“苏南”、“益新”两家私营钢笔店仍不遵守政府法令、积极从事正当经营，却唯利是图，施行欺骗手段，这是一种恶劣的违法行为，当地工商部门必须进行处理。
    编者按：本报曾先后接到十几位读者揭露上述事件的来信，苏州市人民政府工商局也曾收到三百多个受骗的单位的揭发信。现在，苏州市人民政府工商局对这个事件正在进行处理，并已令该两商店在上海“解放日报”、天津“大公报”上公开进行检讨。
