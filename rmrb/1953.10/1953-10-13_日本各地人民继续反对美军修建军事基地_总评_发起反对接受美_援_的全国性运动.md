Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Tokyo: The US and Japanese reactionaries attempted to seize Japan's scenic Mount Myogi as a US military training ground through a popular vote under their control, but this plot has been thwarted. At the same time, measures to militarize Hokkaido are also facing fierce opposition from the Japanese people.

The Yoshida government's plan to designate Mount Myogi as a US military training ground has been delayed due to strong public opposition. Therefore, they devised a method of holding a popular vote under their control and supervision, attempting to force the local people to vote in favor of leasing Mount Myogi to the US military as a training ground. However, the results of the vote held on the 7th in the Usui Town of Mount Myogi showed that an overwhelming majority of people opposed the US military establishing a training ground on Mount Myogi.

Meanwhile, the US and Japanese reactionaries' measures to turn Hokkaido into an invasion base continue to be resisted by the people. Kotoni Town, located northwest of Sapporo City in Hokkaido, has become a transportation hub connecting the port of Otaru and military bases such as Chitose and Makomanai, due to the US military occupying Sapporo and many other places as bases. Residents are often run over or injured by US military vehicles, and harassment and terror engulf the entire town. Therefore, the local people have long launched a struggle against it. Recently, the US military plans to further militarize Kotoni Town completely. According to this plan, the highway through the center of the town will be expanded into a military road 25 meters wide, the riverbank irrigating farmland will be changed to a military canal 50 meters wide, and 30% of the town's land will be occupied without compensation.

The US military's plan to further militarize the town has aroused even more intense opposition from the local people. They united people from all walks of life to form an organization against the US military's militarization of the town, held more than 50 meetings, and more than 80% of the town's residents signed the petition opposing the militarization of Kotoni Town.

Residents of Naka Town in Gifu Prefecture in central Japan, unable to withstand the harassment and persecution from the nearby US military base in Kagamigahara, have also launched a struggle against the US military. The Gifu Prefecture Trade Union Council convened a "Base Countermeasures Committee" on September 15th. At the meeting, a resolution was passed to unite people from all walks of life to carry out a joint struggle to abolish the "US-Japan Administrative Agreement" and oppose US military bases. Three hundred students from the Faculty of Agriculture at Gifu University also participated in this struggle.

[Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (abbreviated as "Sohyo"), in order to counter the large-scale rearmament that the Yoshida government is preparing to undertake under the urging and assistance of the United States, has recently decided to launch a nationwide movement to oppose accepting "aid" from the US Mutual Security Agency, oppose amending the constitution, oppose US military bases, and demand that the Yoshida government take emergency relief measures for areas affected by floods and frost damage. "Sohyo" called on Japanese trade union organizations, farmers' groups, and other democratic groups to participate in this movement.

"Sohyo" decided to convene a meeting of representatives of various democratic groups within October, and an executive committee will be established by the representatives of various democratic groups to promote this movement in various places.

Negotiations on the Yoshida government's acceptance of "aid" from the US Mutual Security Agency are currently being actively conducted in the United States by Yoshida's special envoy, Hayato Ikeda. In order to remove legal obstacles to large-scale rearmament, Eisaku Sato, secretary-general of Yoshida's Liberal Party, announced on the 6th that a special committee would first be established within Yoshida's Liberal Party to study the issue of amending the constitution, which prohibits rearmament.

    日本各地人民继续反对美军修建军事基地
    “总评”发起反对接受美“援”的全国性运动
    据新华社讯：东京消息：美、日反动派企图通过他们控制下的人民投票的办法，强占日本名胜地妙义山为美军演习场，这个阴谋已遭到挫败。同时，北海道军事基地化的措施也受到日本人民的激烈反对。
    吉田政府划妙义山为美军演习场的计划，由于人民的强烈反对，迟迟未能实现。于是它就想出在他们的控制和监视下举行人民投票的办法，企图迫使当地人民投票同意将妙义山租给美军作演习场。但是七日在妙义山的舀井町投票的结果，占压倒多数的人都反对美军在妙义山设演习场。
    同时，美、日反动派把北海道变为侵略基地的措施正继续受到人民的反抗。位于北海道札幌市西北的琴似镇，由于美军把札幌和许多地方霸占为基地，使它变成了连结小樽军港和千岁、真驹内等军事基地的交通枢纽，居民经常被美军车辆压死或撞伤，骚扰和恐怖笼罩着全镇。因此，当地人民早就展开了反对的斗争。近来，美军又计划进一步把琴似镇完全军事化。根据这一计划，通过镇中心的公路将被扩充为横宽二十五公尺的军用公路，灌溉农田的河堤将被改为五十公尺宽的军用运河，全镇百分之三十的土地将被无偿占用。
    美军把该镇进一步军事化的计划，激起了当地人民更激烈的反对。他们团结各阶层人士成立了反对美军使该镇军事化的组织，举行了五十多次集会，全镇百分之八十以上的居民都在反对琴似镇军事化的签名簿上签了名。
    日本中部歧阜县那加镇的居民，由于不堪邻近的各务原的美军基地的骚扰和迫害，也展开了反对美军的斗争。歧阜县工会协议会于九月十五日召开了“基地对策委员会”，会上通过了决议，要团结各界人民进行联合斗争，以废除“美日行政协定”、反对美军基地。歧阜县大学农学系的三百名学生也参加了这次斗争。
    【新华社十二日讯】东京消息：日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）为了反击吉田政府正在美国的督促和帮助下着手准备进行的大规模重新武装，最近决定发起一个全国规模的运动，反对接受美国共同安全署“援助”、反对修改宪法、反对美国军事基地和要求吉田政府对水灾、霜灾地区采取紧急救济措施。“总评”号召日本各工会组织、农民团体及其他各民主团体都参加这个运动。
    “总评”决定在十月内召集各民主团体的代表举行会议，并由各民主团体的代表成立一个执行委员会，以便在各地推进这一运动。
    吉田政府接受美国共同安全署“援助”的谈判，目前正由吉田的特使池田勇人在美国积极进行。为扫除大规模重新武装的法律障碍，吉田自由党干事长佐藤荣作已在六日宣布要首先在吉田自由党内成立一个特别委员会，研究修改禁止重新武装的宪法问题。
