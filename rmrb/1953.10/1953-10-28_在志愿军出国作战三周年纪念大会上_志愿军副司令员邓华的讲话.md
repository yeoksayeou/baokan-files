Comrades:

Today, we solemnly hold the commemoration of the third anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the war. This is of great significance, because the people of Korea and China have already achieved a great victory in defending peace and resisting aggression. At the same time, Chairman Kim Du-bong, Secretary-General Kang Ryang-wook of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's Decoration Conferral Delegation, and the Korean government delegation headed by Park Ui-wan celebrating the third anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the war, and the Third Delegation of the People of the Motherland to Korea headed by General Commander He Long, and the representatives of heroes and model soldiers from the entire army, and the representatives of cadres from the entire army have all honored us with their presence at our meeting, which makes us feel extremely excited and honored.

In the past three years, the Chinese People's Volunteers, with the warm and full support of the people of the motherland, and together with the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army, and with the support of the world's peace and democracy forces led by the Soviet Union, have resolutely carried out the struggle against aggression, defeated the enemy headed by U.S. imperialism, and won the glorious victory of the Korean armistice. This is a great victory for the people of Korea and China in defending peace and resisting aggression, a great victory for the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union, and a great victory for the peace-loving people of the world. Therefore, at the meeting commemorating the third anniversary of our army's participation in the war, I would like to first, on behalf of Commander Peng Dehuai and all commanders and fighters, pay tribute to the heroic Korean people and their wise leader Marshal Kim Il-sung! Pay tribute to the great people of our great motherland and our great leader Chairman Mao! Pay tribute to the democratic countries led by the Soviet Union and the people of the world who are fighting for peace! And express my heartfelt gratitude and respect to Chairman Kim Du-bong and all the representatives of the Korean government Decoration Conferral Delegation, and to General Commander He Long and all the comrades of the Third Delegation of the People of the Motherland to Korea. At the same time, on this day of victory and glory, I, on behalf of the leading organs of the Chinese People's Volunteers, extend warm congratulations to all commanders and fighters! Extend cordial greetings to the comrades who were gloriously wounded and suffered from overwork in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and express deep condolences to the martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

Comrades! Everyone remembers that at this time three years ago, the enemy who landed at Incheon was arrogant and defiant, ignoring the repeated warnings of our government, and recklessly advanced. Its vanguard troops had already reached Chushan on the Yalu River, and shelled our northeast. At that time, the enemy was full of confidence that it could sweep through the entire Korean peninsula before Thanksgiving, and then invade our northeast. Under such a serious situation, our people, in order to defend the security of the motherland and to assist our Korean comrades, dispatched their own sons and daughters, organized the Chinese People's Volunteers, and entered Korea to carry out the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. At this time three years ago, from the encounters with the enemy at Wenjing and Yunshan, after the first, second, and third battles, the enemy was driven all the way back to the south of the 38th parallel - the line of Suwon and Wonju. From then on, all the territory of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea north of the 38th parallel was restored. The enemy's invasion plan was completely crushed. Afterwards, although the enemy gathered forces from the east and west lines, and increased a large number of planes, artillery, and tanks, and continuously launched frantic offensives and counterattacks, it was finally crushed by us. Moreover, our army, in the process of active defense, constructed a steel defense line, and kept the enemy long-termly blocked near the 38th parallel. At the same time, in the continuous counterattacks, the front line was pushed further and further south. In order to defend the motherland and defend peace, the righteous war waged by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, although temporarily inferior to the enemy in equipment, was able to defeat the enemy because we had a high degree of political awareness, were brave and resolute, and came up with many ways to overcome difficulties.

In the past three years, we have become stronger and stronger in the war. Not only have we been able to crush countless enemy offensives, both large and small, but we have also been able to frequently organize victorious counterattacks, annihilate the enemy in entire companies, platoons, and battalions, and capture enemy positions. Not only were we able to defeat the enemy's frenzied attacks like those on Shangganling, but in the summer of this year, we were also able to carry out large-scale counterattacks like those south of Kimseong - opening up gaps in the enemy's positions defended by four divisions, so that the U.S. imperialism and the Lee Syngman bandit gang, who had repeatedly obstructed and sabotaged the realization of the armistice and frantically clamored for "unifying Korea by force," were finally forced to accept the armistice. The enemy recently confessed that more than 1.4 million of its troops were annihilated by us in the past three years, and a large amount of material and equipment were also lost, but none of its aggressive goals were achieved. This proves that the era in which the U.S. aggressors arbitrarily ran amok and enslaved the Asian people is gone forever.

The great victory won by the Korean and Chinese people in the struggle against the U.S. imperialist aggression not only defended the independence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the integrity of the democratic base, defended the security and construction of China, but also disrupted the U.S. imperialist plan and timetable for launching a new world war, thereby inspiring the fighting spirit of the peace-loving people of the world and strengthening the forces of peace. The armies of Korea and China have also been greatly trained in this struggle, and have gained rich experience in defeating the highly modernized U.S. aggressor army with inferior equipment. This will have a huge impact on our future national defense construction. Therefore, the significance of this victory is very great.

Comrades! The reason why we have been able to achieve such a great victory is inseparable from the enthusiastic help of the Korean people and the coordinated combat of the Korean People's Army. The Korean people treated the Volunteers as their own brothers and sisters. Whenever we had difficulties or needs, whether it was food, vegetables, firewood, or houses, furniture, etc., they always tried their best to help us solve them. The Korean people helped us rescue and transport the wounded on the battlefield. The glorious deeds of Park Jae-geun-style self-sacrificing cover for the wounded Volunteers are the most moving to us. When our army was constructing fortifications, the Korean people helped us dig tunnels with manpower and machinery, which accelerated the speed of our construction. The Korean government awarded medals and badges to our army's meritorious personnel, and frequently sent delegations and art troupes to express their sympathy, which gave us great spiritual inspiration and encouragement. The Korean People's Army's coordination with our army in combat was even closer, and various combat tasks were completed very well. Therefore, it not only reduced many difficulties for our participation in the war, but also increased our strength and confidence. Without the enthusiastic help of the Korean people and their government, and without the coordinated combat of the Korean People's Army, it would have been impossible to defeat the ferocious enemy. Therefore, glory should be attributed to the Korean people and their leader Marshal Kim Il-sung.

Our victory is even more due to Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the full support of the people of the motherland. The people of the motherland mobilized their most outstanding sons and daughters to the Korean front, so that our troops could be frequently replenished and fully staffed. The people of the motherland donated a large number of airplanes, artillery, and tanks, improved our equipment, and enhanced our firepower. The people of the motherland not only ensured the necessary supplies for our material life, but also continuously encouraged us spiritually, and called us "the most beloved people," and sent many delegations and cultural troupes to the front to encourage us. The care of the people of the motherland for us is meticulous, which is the main factor that makes us stronger and stronger in the war. Without Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the enthusiastic support of the people of the motherland, it would have been impossible for us to defeat the ferocious enemy. Therefore, glory should be attributed to the great people of the motherland and the great leader Chairman Mao.

Similarly, our victory is due to the warm support of the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union, the great role of the Soviet Union's consistent implementation of a policy of peace, and the continuous upsurge of the world's people's peace and anti-war movement. With these many favorable conditions, we were able to continuously achieve victory and quickly reach an armistice. Therefore, glory should be attributed to the democratic countries led by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world. We should correctly estimate and recognize the various factors of the victory of the war, and never attribute the achievements of everyone's efforts to ourselves, let alone be complacent and arrogant.

Although the Korean War has stopped, U.S. imperialism is systematically making the Korean armistice unstable and continuing to maintain international tension. The strength of the U.S. invading army in Korea has not only not decreased, but is also increasing. The U.S. Marine Corps' Third Division has been deployed to Japan. The Lee Syngman bandit gang is still actively conscripting troops, preparing to expand to twenty divisions by the end of this year, and has also formed the so-called "National Patriotic Army" with retired soldiers and reserve "militia" as a second-line force.

At the same time, they are also carrying out plots to sabotage the political conference, and are doing everything possible to obstruct and sabotage the explanation work for prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated. Enemy planes are also constantly crossing the border and entering our area to carry out reconnaissance activities, and are frequently creating incidents that violate the armistice agreement. All these signs prove that the U.S. imperialists are not reconciled to their failure in Korea, and are actively preparing for war, preparing to make a comeback. Therefore, we should be a hundred times more vigilant, maintain our high fighting will, be strictly on guard, defend our positions, and closely monitor and prevent any provocations and aggressive actions by the enemy. If the enemy dares to violate the agreement and launch another aggression, then we will give the enemy an even more disastrous blow.

On the occasion of commemorating the third anniversary of the Volunteers' participation in the war, we would like to express to Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland, and to Marshal Kim Il-sung and the Korean people: We will strengthen our military, political, and cultural studies to make us more substantial and stronger; we will respond to the call of the motherland, streamline and save, tighten expenditures, cherish materials, weapons, ammunition, and all equipment, oppose waste and undue losses, in order to concentrate our efforts to strengthen the economic construction of the motherland. We will never disappoint the Korean people and the people of the motherland's expectations of us. We will further consolidate and develop the fighting friendship between the people of Korea and China, which is condensed with flesh and blood, and unite more closely with the Korean people and the People's Army, and strive to the end to ensure the thorough implementation of the armistice, to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and to defend lasting peace in the Far East and the world!

Long live the victory of the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea!

Eternal glory to the martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea!

Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the people of Korea and China!

Long live the heroic Korean people and the wise leader of the Korean people, Marshal Kim Il-sung!

Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

Long live the great motherland and the people of the motherland!

Long live the world peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union!

### 在志愿军出国作战三周年纪念大会上  志愿军副司令员邓华的讲话

    在志愿军出国作战三周年纪念大会上
    志愿军副司令员邓华的讲话亲爱的同志们：
    今天，我们在这里隆重地举行中国人民志愿军出国作战三周年纪念大会，是有极大的意义的，因为朝中两国人民业已取得了保卫和平反抗侵略的伟大胜利。同时，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国授勋代表金枓奉委员长，康良煜书记长和以朴义琓为首的朝鲜政府祝贺中国人民志愿军出国作战三周年代表团，以贺龙总团长为首的祖国人民第三届赴朝慰问团，还有全军英雄模范代表和全军干部代表都光临了我们的大会，更使我们感到无比的兴奋和荣幸。
    三年来，中国人民志愿军在祖国人民的热烈的全力的支援下，和英雄的朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军在一起，在以苏联为首的全世界和平民主力量的支持下，坚决地进行了反侵略的斗争，打败了以美帝国主义为首的敌人，获致了朝鲜停战的光荣胜利。这是朝、中两国人民保卫和平、反抗侵略斗争的伟大胜利，是以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的伟大胜利，是全世界爱好和平人民的伟大胜利。因此，在纪念我军出国作战三周年的大会上，我首先代表彭德怀司令员和全军指挥员、战斗员向英雄的朝鲜人民及其英明的领袖金日成元帅致敬！向我们伟大的祖国人民和我们伟大的领袖毛主席致敬！向以苏联为首的民主国家和全世界为和平而斗争的人民致敬！并向金枓奉委员长和朝鲜政府授勋代表团全体代表、向贺龙总团长和祖国人民第三届赴朝慰问团全体同志，致以衷心的感谢和敬意。同时，在这个胜利与光荣的节日里，我代表中国人民志愿军领导机关，向全军指挥员、战斗员致热烈的祝贺！向在抗美援朝战争中光荣负伤、积劳成病的同志们致亲切的慰问，向在抗美援朝战争中英勇献身的烈士们致深切的哀悼。
    同志们！大家都记得，在三年前的这个时候，从仁川登陆的敌人趾高气扬，不顾我国政府的再三警告，疯狂冒进，其先头部队已进抵鸭绿江边的楚山，并炮击我国东北。当时的敌人，满以为在感恩节以前便可席卷全部朝鲜，并进而侵略我国东北。我国人民在这种严重的情况下，为了保卫祖国的安全，为了援助朝鲜友人而派遣了自己的子弟，组织了中国人民志愿军，进入朝鲜进行抗美援朝的战争。在三年前的这个时候，从温井、云山同敌遭遇战斗起，经过一、二、三次战役后，把敌人一直打回到
    “三八线”以南——水原、原州之线。从此，“三八线”以北的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的领土全部恢复。敌人的侵略计划便被彻底粉碎了。以后，虽然敌人纠集了东西两线的力量，并增加了大量的飞机、大炮、坦克，不断地进行疯狂的进攻和反扑，但终于被我粉碎。并且，我军在积极防御过程中，构成了钢铁防线，把敌人长期地阻止在“三八线”附近，同时，在不断的反击中，使战线日益向南推移。为了保卫祖国、保卫和平，进行正义战争的朝、中人民军队，虽然在装备上暂时不如敌人，但因我们有高度的政治觉悟，勇敢坚决，想出了很多办法克服困难，所以我们战胜了敌人。
    三年来，我们越战越强，不但能够粉碎敌人无数次的大小进攻，而且还能经常地组织胜利的反击，整连整排整营地消灭敌人和攻占敌人阵地。我们不但能够打败像敌人向上甘岭那样的疯狂进攻，到了今年夏季，我们还能进行像金城以南那样大规模的反击——打开了敌人四个师所据守的阵地的缺口，使曾经再三阻挠和破坏停战实现的美帝国主义和疯狂叫嚣要以“武力统一朝鲜”的李承晚匪帮，终于不得不被迫接受了停战。敌人最近供称：三年来被我歼灭的兵力，达一百四十余万人之多，物资装备亦遭受了大量的损失，但它的侵略目的却一个也没有达到。这就证明了：美国侵略者任意横行并奴役亚洲人民的那种时代，是永远地一去不复返了。
    朝中人民在反抗美帝国主义侵略的斗争中所取得的这一伟大胜利，不仅保卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立和民主基地的完整，保卫了中国的安全与建设，而且打乱了美帝国主义发动新的世界战争的计划和时间表，从而鼓舞了全世界爱好和平的人民的斗志，增强了和平的力量。朝中两国的军队也从这一斗争中受到了极大的锻炼，取得了以劣势装备打败高度现代化的美国侵略军的丰富经验。这对我们今后国防建设是有巨大作用的。所以，这个胜利的意义是很大的。
    同志们！我们之所以能够取得这样伟大的胜利，是与朝鲜人民的热情帮助，是与朝鲜人民军的协同配合作战分不开的。朝鲜人民把志愿军当成自己的兄弟姊妹一般的看待，每当我们有困难或有所需要的时候，不论是粮食、菜蔬、柴草或者是房屋、家具等等，总是竭力帮助我们解决。朝鲜人民在战地上帮助我们抢救、运送伤员，像朴在根式的舍身掩护志愿军伤员的光辉事迹是最使我们感动的。在我军构筑工事时，朝鲜人民又以人力和机器来帮助我们开凿坑道，促进我们构筑工事的速度。朝鲜政府对我军的立功人员授予勋章、奖章，并经常派出代表团、文艺团体来进行慰问，在精神上给了我们莫大的激励与鼓舞。朝鲜人民军在战斗中与我军的协同配合，更是十分亲密，各种战斗任务都完成得很好。因此，不仅减少了我们出国作战的许多困难，而且增加了我们的力量和信心。没有朝鲜人民及其政府对我们的热烈帮助，没有朝鲜人民军的协同作战，要战胜凶恶的敌人是不可能的。所以，光荣应归于朝鲜人民及其领袖金日成元帅。
    我们的胜利更是由于毛主席的英明领导与祖国人民的全力支援而得来的。祖国人民动员了自己最优秀的儿女到朝鲜前线，使得我们部队能够经常的充实和满员。祖国人民捐献了大量的飞机、大炮和坦克，改善了我们的装备，增强了我们的火力。祖国人民不仅保证了我们物质生活上的必需供应，而且在精神上亦不断地鼓舞着我们，并把我们称为“最可爱的人”，多次派遣慰问团、文工团到前线来鼓励我们。祖国人民对我们的关怀是无微不至的，这就是我们越打越强的主要因素。没有毛主席的英明领导和祖国人民的热烈支援，我们要想战胜凶恶的敌人是不可能的。所以，光荣应该归于伟大的祖国人民和伟大的领袖毛主席。
    同样的，我们的胜利是由于以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的热烈声援，是由于苏联一贯执行和平政策的巨大作用，是由于全世界人民和平反战运动的不断高涨。有了这许多有利条件，才使我们能不断地取得胜利并迅速达成停战。所以光荣应归于以苏联为首的各民主国家及全世界爱好和平的人民。我们应正确地估计与认识到战争胜利的种种因素，决不应把大家努力的成果归之于自己身上，更不能居功骄傲。
    朝鲜战争虽已经停止，但美帝国主义正在有计划地使朝鲜停战处于不稳定的状态，继续保持国际紧张局势。美国侵略军队在朝鲜的力量不但没有减少，而且还在加强。美陆战三师已开到日本。李承晚匪帮仍在积极抽兵，准备在今年底扩大到二十个师，同时又把退伍军人与后备“民兵”组成所谓
    “国民爱国军”，作为第二线兵力。
    同时，它们还在进行着破坏政治会议的预谋，并百般阻挠与破坏对不直接遣返战俘的解释工作。敌人的飞机也不断越界进入我区进行侦察活动，并经常制造违反停战协定的事件。这一切迹象，都证明美帝国主义者不甘心于它在朝鲜的失败，正在积极进行备战，准备卷土重来。所以我们应百倍警惕，保持我们高度的战斗意志，严密戒备，坚守阵地，密切注视和防止敌人的任何挑衅和侵袭行动。如果敌人敢于破坏协定，再度发动侵略的话，那末，我们将给予敌人以更惨重的打击。
    在纪念志愿军出国作战三周年的时候，我们谨向毛主席和祖国人民表示，向金日成元帅和朝鲜人民表示：我们要加强军事、政治、文化的学习，使我们更加充实和强大；要响应祖国号召，精简节约，紧缩开支，爱护物资、武器、弹药及一切器材，反对浪费和不应有的损耗，以便集中力量加强祖国的经济建设。我们决不辜负朝鲜人民和祖国人民对我们的期望，我们要进一步地巩固和发展朝中两国人民以血肉凝结成的战斗友谊，更加紧密地和朝鲜人民与人民军团结一致，为保障停战的彻底实施、为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决、为保卫远东与世界的持久和平而奋斗到底！
    伟大的抗美援朝斗争的胜利万岁！
    在抗美援朝战争中英勇牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
    朝中人民牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
    英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民的英明领袖金日成元帅万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    伟大的祖国和祖国人民万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营万岁！
