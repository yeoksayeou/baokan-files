    [This newspaper dispatch] The Tanggu New Port held a grand anniversary celebration meeting on the 17th. Those attending the meeting included Wang Shoudao, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government, responsible persons from the Maritime Transport Administration Bureau and Navigation Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, Wang Xiaoyi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, as well as representatives from various organizations and New Port employees, totaling more than 1,400 people. Soviet experts Shashkov and Grisenko were also invited to attend.

    The meeting was opened by Wu Yingmin, Director of the Tianjin District Port Affairs Administration Bureau. He said: Over the past year, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the employees of various departments of the New Port project have closely cooperated and demonstrated their labor enthusiasm, and the work of the New Port has made great progress. The draft of the channels and docks has become deeper, and many warehouses, cargo yards and other buildings have been added to the port area. Our ships have also received timely repairs, and the dock management work and loading and unloading efficiency have created unprecedented new records. From January to September this year, the import and export of materials from Tianjin Port has exceeded any year since liberation, and the material throughput in September this year has created the highest monthly throughput record in nearly ten years. In the future, the tasks of the New Port will be more arduous, and the relevant departments will further strengthen unity to better complete the task of domestic and foreign material exchange assigned to us by the Party and the People's Government.

    Zhou Lun, Director of the Port Construction Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government, then reported on the labor achievements of the New Port employees in the port construction project. He emphatically pointed out that the achievements of the New Port today are inseparable from the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, especially technical guidance.

    Soviet expert Shashkov was invited to speak. He congratulated the New Port employees on their achievements over the past year. He also wished the New Port employees to make even greater achievements on the basis of this victory.

    Wang Shoudao, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government, spoke. He said: The facts of the past year have proved that the construction work and port management work of the New Port have made great achievements. The engineering department has completed the project progress task. The port affairs department has managed the port well, and especially the stevedores have completed the highest loading and unloading quota under poor equipment conditions. After the opening of the New Port, it has played a great role in the prosperity of Tianjin and the North China market and the national construction. He called on all employees to carry forward the working spirit of the past and do their work better. The port construction department should meet the requirements of "good, fast, and economical" so that the country can complete greater engineering construction tasks with less money. The port management department, especially the stevedores, should better complete the state's material throughput task, achieve "fast loading and unloading," and improve the ship turnover rate. Pilots should achieve "fast entry and fast exit." The ship repair department should integrate the ship repair work well with ship transportation. All departments should closely cooperate to build the New Port into a new modern port that undertakes the exchange of domestic and foreign materials, and the exchange of urban and rural materials.

    Wang Xiaoyi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, spoke. He said: Due to the selfless labor of the New Port employees over the past year, the exchange of domestic and foreign materials has been promoted, and greater prosperity has also been brought to Tianjin. He, on behalf of Wu De, Mayor of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, paid tribute to the New Port employees and expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Soviet experts who helped our country build the port.

    Employee representatives from the New Port Engineering Team, Tianjin Dredging Team, New Port Operating Area, and Tugboat Brigade unanimously pledged at the meeting that they would further develop their enthusiasm and creativity, find tricks, tap potential, and successfully complete this year's tasks. The employee representatives of the New Port Operating Area of the Tianjin District Port Affairs Administration Bureau proposed a guarantee: fast loading and unloading, so that each ship can leave the port one tide earlier, saving each ship 30 million yuan in berthing fees. And in the fourth quarter of this year, they will load more goods, increase production by more than 310 million yuan, and save more than 320 million yuan in expenses.
