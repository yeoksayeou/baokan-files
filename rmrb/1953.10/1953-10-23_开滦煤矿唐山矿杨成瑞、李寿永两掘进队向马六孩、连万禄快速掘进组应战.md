The Yang Chengrui and Li Shouyong tunneling teams of Tangshan Mine, Kailuan Coal Mine, wrote: We are workers from Kailuan Coal Mine, which is rich in revolutionary traditions. In the past, in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, we stood heroically at the forefront. Today, as our great motherland begins its first Five-Year Plan, we are determined to be at the forefront as well. We guarantee to overfulfill the glorious task assigned to us by the state this year and prepare for next year's production. Since our mine launched the "increase production and practice economy" campaign in mid-September, production has been rising steadily. In September, we completed 106.29 percent of the state plan. However, with the development of increasing production and practicing economy, the prominent problem currently is that tunneling work cannot keep up with the needs of mining. From September to December this year, the total tunneling workload of the entire mine is approximately 61 percent of the annual tunneling plan, which poses a daunting task for our tunneling workers. But we are confident in completing this task. After several days of discussion, we formulated a plan to increase production and practice economy for the fourth quarter, and on the 10th of this month, we held a signing ceremony to challenge the Ma Liuhai and Lian Wanlu rapid tunneling groups of Datong Coal Mine and to challenge all tunneling teams in the Kailuan mining area.

    The Yang Chengrui tunneling team's challenge conditions are:

    (1) Guarantee to tunnel 1,740 meters in the fourth quarter, tunneling 19.3 meters per day, and an average of 580 meters per month, striving to reach 600 meters. The total quarter will exceed the state plan by 201 meters, producing 1,311 more tons of coal, totaling an increase of 143,124,800 yuan.

    (2) Guarantee safe production and no minor or major injuries.

    (3) Guarantee to save 0.5 kilograms of explosives and 0.17 detonators per meter of tunneling. Ensure that the sheds meet specifications and that no pit wood is wasted. The total quarter is expected to save 2,825,760 yuan.

    (4) If the tunneling efficiency of each worker is calculated in meters, it will be 22.9 percent higher than the state plan; if calculated in tons, it will be 17.4 percent higher than the state plan.

    To accomplish the above conditions, we will take the following measures:

    (1) Modestly learn the advanced working methods of Ma Liuhai, adopt deep-hole hollow blasting, yellow sand blasting, and single-eye grooving and cracking methods, making the blasting holes as deep as 2 meters.

    (2) Fix job types, fix work, and consolidate the three-person responsibility system.

    (3) Ensure that roadways and supports meet specifications.

    (4) Each job type operates in a cycle, using production instruction charts.

    (5) Except for sick workers, guarantee an attendance rate of 100 percent. Hold a 20-minute meeting after work to study the next day's operations; hold joint meetings of all shifts and group meetings to conscientiously implement the shift handover system; further consolidate the technical research association to improve technology and ensure the smooth completion of the competition plan.

    The Li Shouyong tunneling team's challenge conditions are:

    (1) Guarantee to tunnel 1,620 meters in the fourth quarter, tunneling 18 meters per day, and an average of 540 meters per month, striving to reach 580 meters. The total quarter will exceed the state plan by 180 meters, producing 1,128 more tons of coal, totaling an increase of 131,750,400 yuan.

    (2) Guarantee to save 0.5 kilograms of explosives and 0.17 detonators per meter of tunneling. Ensure that the sheds meet specifications and that large timbers are not used for small purposes, wasting pit wood. The total year is expected to save 2,630,880 yuan.

    (3) If the tunneling efficiency of each worker is calculated in meters, it will be 13.6 percent higher than the state plan; if calculated in tons, it will be 17 percent higher than the state plan.

    (4) Guarantee safe tunneling and no minor or major injuries.

    To ensure the realization of the above conditions, we have decided to:

    (1) Continue to learn the advanced working methods of Ma Liuhai, to achieve fixed job types and clear responsibilities; each job type operates in a cycle, using charts to instruct production.

    (2) Learn deep-hole operation and yellow sand blasting methods, making the blasting holes as deep as 2 meters and ensuring that the roadways meet specifications.

    (3) Use wax bags to pack explosives; when encountering water holes, load the explosives last and pull the detonator first to avoid misfires.

    (4) Require an attendance rate of 96 to 98 percent; strictly implement various meeting systems and the shift handover system; hold joint meetings of the three shifts and group meetings, with everyone working together to find ways to ensure the completion of the production increase and economy practice plan.

    开滦煤矿唐山矿杨成瑞、李寿永两掘进队向马六孩、连万禄快速掘进组应战
    开滦煤矿唐山矿杨成瑞掘进队、李寿永掘进队来信：我们是富于革命传统的开滦煤矿的工人。过去，在反对帝国主义、反对封建主义、反对官僚资本主义的斗争中，我们曾英勇地站在前列；今天当我们伟大的祖国开始第一个五年建设计划的时候，我们也决心要走在前面。我们保证超额地完成今年国家给予我们的光荣任务，并为明年的生产做好准备工作。我们矿自从九月中旬开展增产节约竞赛以来，产量一直是直线上升。九月份完成国家计划百分之一百零六点二九。但随着增产节约的发展，当前突出地存在着的问题是掘进工作赶不上回采工作的需要。今年九月到十二月份，全矿的掘进工作量约等于全年度掘进计划的百分之六十一，这就给我们掘进工人提出了一个艰巨的任务。但我们有信心完成这个任务。经过几天的讨论，我们制订出第四季度的增产节约计划，并在本月十日举行了向大同煤矿马六孩、连万禄快速掘进组应战和向开滦全矿区掘进队挑战的签字仪式。
    杨成瑞掘进队的应战条件是：
    （一）保证第四季度掘进一千七百四十公尺，每日掘进十九点三公尺，平均每月掘进五百八十公尺，争取达到六百公尺。全季度比国家计划提高二百零一公尺，多产煤一千三百一十一吨，合计增产一亿四千三百一十二万四千八百元。
    （二）保证安全生产，不出任何轻重伤事故。
    （三）保证每掘进一公尺节省炮药零点五个，雷管零点一七个。保证棚子符合规格，不浪费坑木。全季度合计节约二百八十二万五千七百六十元。
    （四）每个工的掘进效率如以公尺数计算，保证较国家计划提高百分之二十二点九；如以吨数计算，要较国家计划提高百分之十七点四。
    为了完成上述条件，我们采取以下办法：
    （一）虚心学习马六孩先进工作法，采用深孔空心爆破法、黄沙爆破法和独眼拉槽龟裂法，炮眼做到深达二公尺。
    （二）固定工种，固定工作，巩固三人负责制。
    （三）保证巷道和支架合乎规格。
    （四）各工种循环操作，采用生产指示图表。
    （五）除病号外，保证出勤率达百分之百。开好收工后二十分钟的碰头会，研究第二天的作业；开好各班联席会和小组会，认真执行交接班制度；进一步巩固技术研究会以提高技术，保证顺利地完成竞赛计划。
    李寿永掘进队的应战条件是：
    （一）保证第四季度掘进一千六百二十公尺，每日掘进十八公尺，每月平均掘进五百四十公尺，争取达到五百八十公尺。全季度比国家计划提高一百八十公尺，多产煤一千一百二十八吨，合计增产一亿三千一百七十五万零四百元。
    （二）保证每掘进一公尺节省炮药零点五个，雷管零点一七个。保证棚子符合规格，不大材小用浪费坑木。全年度合计节约二百六十三万零八百八十元。
    （三）每个工的掘进效率如果以公尺数计算，保证较国家计划提高百分之十三点六；如果按吨数计算，保证较国家计划提高百分之十七。
    （四）保证安全掘进，不出任何轻重伤事故。
    为保证上述条件的实现，我们决定：
    （一）继续学习马六孩先进工作法，做到工种固定，责任明确；各工种循环操作，以图表指示生产。
    （二）学习深空作业和黄沙爆破法，做到炮眼深达二公尺，巷道合乎规格。
    （三）利用蜡袋装药，遇到水眼就后装药先拉，避免瞎炮。
    （四）出勤率要求达到百分之九十六至九十八；严格执行各种会议制度和交接班制度，开好三班联席会小组会，大家共同想办法保证完成增产节约计划。
