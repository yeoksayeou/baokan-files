    A Record of the Victory Exhibition of the Korean People's Army
    Wu Ming
    In the heroic city of Pyongyang, which is unfolding restoration and reconstruction work, the Korean People's Army has held the "Comprehensive Exhibition Commemorating the Victory of the Fatherland Liberation War of the Korean People's Army." The people of Pyongyang proudly call it the "Victory Exhibition." Since its opening on August 16th, thousands of people have come here every day to visit, learn, and pay their highest respects to the People's Army.
    Passing through the magnificent archway with red flags waving, people first enter the "Preface Hall" of the exhibition. What is displayed here before people is the general process of the heroic Korean People's Army growing, becoming stronger, and marching towards victory. Here are the battle deeds of the anti-Japanese guerrillas led by Marshal Kim Il-sung. This spark ignited along both sides of the Yalu River, fighting the Japanese invaders hand in hand with the Chinese people; then, in cooperation with the great Soviet army, it defeated the Japanese invaders and restored the country. In the long anti-Japanese war, Kim Il-sung taught the people how to wage tenacious and unyielding struggles against the enemy and laid the foundation for the creation of the glorious Korean People's Army.
    The heroic spirit of this People's Army, which grew out of trials and tribulations, is prominently manifested in the "Revenge Manual" written by the soldiers of the People's Army during the Fatherland Liberation War. This is an epic of the soldiers' counterattack against the American invaders, recording their heroic battle results in killing the enemy. In the manual of the hero of the Republic, Liu Qihuang, it is written item by item: from May 8th to July 8th in 1952, he experienced more than 20 battles and eliminated a total of 152 enemies. On the manual jointly used by two close comrades-in-arms, soldiers Kang Xiaojun and Che Xianglu, it is recorded that from May 24th to October 9th, 1952, they eliminated a total of 54 enemies. On October 10th, 1952, Kang Xiaojun, the immortal soldier who carried this victory manual, heroically sacrificed himself on Height 851. A bullet pierced their manual. Che Xianglu wrote his oath on this "manual": "Robbers, although you have pierced our manual and taken the life of my closest comrade-in-arms, the power with which he killed you has been completely transformed into me, and I must record your deaths around every bullet hole..." Sure enough, after this, more than 20 enemies fell before the accurate firepower of this hero. The hero's new achievements were written around the bullet holes in the manual. The victory of the Korean people is accumulated by the records of these heroes.
    Every visitor must pay long attention and respect to a national flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It is the national flag that fluttered in the wind of victory on Jiaqi Peak in the eastern front battle in 1951 when the Korean People's Army crushed the enemy's autumn offensive. Around the national flag are displayed many party membership cards of the immortal Labor Party member soldiers. Each party membership card has bullet holes or blood stains. Before going to war, the hero of the Republic, Kim Chang-jeol, attached to his party membership card the heroic words: "I know that this trip will be a farewell to my motherland and people forever, but the motherland and people need me like this, and I can only feel glorious!" For the sake of victory, for the sake of the national flag of the motherland flying on the land of the motherland, how many outstanding Labor Party members shed their last drop of blood. The fortress role of the glorious Labor Party members in the battle is the guarantee for the Korean people to achieve great victory.
    In another part of the "Preface Hall," many splendid banners cluster around the portrait of Marshal Kim Il-sung. Some of these banners come from factories in Moscow and collective farms in Siberia, some cross the Carpathian Mountains from the banks of the blue Danube, some come from the vast grasslands of Mongolia, and even more come from the new China of 500 million people. The entire world peace and democracy camp is celebrating the victory of the Korean people and supporting the Korean people with their unparalleled strength to continue to achieve victory.
    Following the "Preface Hall" is the "Infantry Hall." Everything here is electric. At the touch of a button, people can clearly see the four stages of the development of the Korean War and its brilliant achievements. Press the button again and people see that from the second half of 1951, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers guarded the steel-like "underground Great Wall" near the 38th parallel, crushing the victorious battles of countless enemy invasions, large and small.
    Specially marked are Height 1211 and Height 1052 on the eastern front. This is the battlefield known to the world as the "Heartbreak Ridge" by the American invading army itself.
    From September 5th to November 11th, 1951, more than 15,900 corpses of enemies who continuously attacked this area were abandoned. Ridgway had launched a so-called "scorched earth tactic" here, firing at least 30,000 shells at this area every day for more than half a month. After September, the enemy averaged 7.5 heavy bombs per square meter of this highland every day. The enemy also drove tens of thousands of its most elite 187th Airborne Regiment, the 1st Marine Division, and the 3rd Infantry Division of the US Army into the offensive, but they were repeatedly defeated miserably by the Chinese and North Korean people's forces. The heroes victoriously executed Marshal Kim Il-sung's order with their iron will: "Do not retreat a single step."
    On display here are the blood-stained clothes of the heroes Li Shoufu and Kim Myung-chul, who sacrificed themselves to block the enemy's gun holes; there is the blood-stained party membership card left by the artillery commander Lu Taizhen, who insisted on fighting despite being seriously injured, and a letter he wrote to the Supreme Commander. The letter reads: "I dedicated the last drop of my blood and gloriously defended the high ground of the motherland."
    In the center of the exhibition room to the left, a heavy machine gun is erected. It has been used by 18 excellent shooters, who have successively used it to kill or wound 1,738 enemies. Next to it is a revolving gun, and the hero Kim Zuoxun used the flames spewed out by this gun to kill or wound 278 enemies.
    After the "Infantry Hall," the exhibition sequentially arranges the Engineering Corps, Reconnaissance Soldiers, Communications, Tanks, Artillery, Navy, Air Force, Automobile Transportation, and Political Culture, Rear Area, and other halls. Each hall has very rich content. Through the various charts, models, and objects of the exhibition, it fully illustrates that although the Korean People's Army has only a short history of five years of military construction, it has grown into a heroic force with high military literacy, regularization, and modernization in the test and training of the anti-aggression war.
    Each hall has countless heroic deeds.
    In the "Reconnaissance Soldier Hall," the "Double Hero" Li Xuewen appeared. He is one of the four "Double Heroes" of the People's Army. In the war for more than three years, he skillfully operated behind enemy lines and achieved brilliant victories. He once took more than 20 reconnaissance soldiers to completely destroy the enemy's two battalions of artillery positions and wiped out more than 60 enemies. He once cleverly captured 43 Li pseudo-soldiers alive without firing a shot. He once led a company deep into the enemy's rear, operated for more than a month, completed the reconnaissance mission, and captured more than 50 enemies alive, including two American officers. His heroic deeds attract every visitor like a myth.
    In the "Communications Hall," miraculous achievements are also displayed. The distance traveled by the brave communications soldiers in more than three years, according to the statistics of a certain communication work alone, can circle the earth 654 times.
    The "Automobile Transportation Hall" tells us countless heroic examples of automobile drivers. Their underground automobile factories, set up to overcome difficulties, insisted on working and created more than 600 kinds of machines and parts.
    Look at the model in the "Engineering Corps Hall"! The Datong River, the Feiliu River, the Licheng River... are rushing, and the long bridges are erected on the river. This is the most acute irony for the enemy who boasts of "air superiority." At a place less than hundreds or even dozens of meters away from the enemy, the heroes were opening mountains and digging rocks, and built the "underground Great Wall." The exhibition displays a model of a tunnel made by the soldiers themselves, which is not only a combat position, but also a "soldiers' home" including a club, a blacksmith's furnace, a kitchen, a bathroom, etc. The soldiers fought bravely, studied hard, and lived happily here. The art and labor of building tunnels by the wise and brave engineers provided the conditions for victory and have been praised by the people of the world.
    In contrast to the heroic deeds of the heroes, the exhibition also displays some materials about the enemy suffering severe blows. Next to an American star-spangled banner printed with the enemy's dirty footprints, which was abandoned when the enemy fled, are a large number of various documents of the enemy. There is a "residence permit" from Illinois, USA, as well as a "night pass" from Tokyo, Japan, and various certificates of the US military in the Philippines, West Germany, and Britain, as well as a "surrender certificate" composed of English letters spelling Chinese sounds and an "emergency" request certificate printed in ten languages.
    What is even more attractive here is the countless spoils seized from the enemy.
    When visitors enter the "Spoils Exhibition Hall," the first thing they see are those colorful clothes. Turkish military uniforms with flower gourds embroidered on the shoulders, earth-red "F-80" pilot uniforms, US Marine Corps 1st Division military uniforms, dark green Dutch military uniforms, US Navy waterproof uniforms with monk hats as hat flowers, flower-green British camouflage uniforms, "B-26" pilot uniforms with crisscross ropes, Greek uniforms with six buttons, special agent uniforms with cherry blossoms as marks, and other Philippine, French, and Australian uniforms, almost everything is available. There are also blood-stained "nylon bulletproof vests," which are a kind of "magic weapon" used by American generals to deceive soldiers to their deaths. Then, visitors can see the exhibition of captured ordnance. Hundreds of thousands of weapons mark the "scientific civilization" of the American invaders in killing people. Here are handguns specially used for assassination that are so small that several can be packed in a small pocket, as well as cannons, tanks, and airplanes. There are also high-explosive bombs that look like toys specially used to kill children, which make every visitor gnash their teeth. But weapons cannot save the invaders from failure. Now they are arranged neatly in the exhibition hall and have become the spoils of the Korean people. Like the 45-ton American "Patton" tank, some have been riddled with holes by our army's anti-tank weapons, while others have been captured by the hands of the heroic people completely—even the glossy green paint on them has not peeled off at all.
    When visitors see that row of various enemy aircraft, they inevitably express their infinite hatred for the robbers who destroyed their cities and homes; at the same time, they also miss and admire their heroes even more, who smashed the enemy's clamor of so-called "air superiority." Like the famous double hero Kim Ki-wook, he shot down 11 enemy aircraft in 16 days; later, Li Bizhen used his anti-aircraft machine gun to shoot down 5 enemy aircraft and won the title of "Hero of the Republic." Now, this machine gun is placed in the exhibition hall, making every visitor feel proud.
    This extraordinarily rich and moving "Victory Exhibition" truly shows that the Korean People's Army is glorious, great, and invincible. It is a victorious epitome of the Korean People's Army's arduous struggle and heroic battle. It not only tells us the great significance of victory, but also tells us how victory was achieved.

    记朝鲜人民军的胜利展览会
    吴明
    在展开着恢复与重建工作的英雄城市平壤，朝鲜人民军举办了“祖国解放战争胜利纪念朝鲜人民军综合展览会”。平壤人民骄傲地称它为“胜利展览会”，从八月十六日开幕以来，每天都有成千上万的人群来这里参观、学习，并向人民军致崇高的敬意。
    通过红旗招展的壮丽牌坊，人们首先走进了展览会的“序馆”。这儿显示在人们面前的是英雄的朝鲜人民军成长、壮大和走向胜利的总的过程。这儿有金日成元帅所领导的抗日游击队的战斗事迹。这一星星之火，沿着鸭绿江两岸燃烧起来，和中国人民携手打击日本侵略者；而后又配合伟大的苏联军队战胜日寇，光复祖国。在长期的抗日战争中，金日成教导了人民如何向敌人进行顽强不屈的斗争，并为创建光荣的朝鲜人民军打下了基础。
    这一支从千锤百炼中成长起来的人民军队的英雄气概，突出地表现在人民军战士在祖国解放战争中写下的“报仇手册”上。这是战士们反击美国侵略者的史诗，记载着他们英勇杀敌的战果。共和国英雄刘其璜的手册上，一条一条地写着：从一九五二年五月八日到七月八日两个月中，他经历了二十多次战斗，一共消灭了敌人一百五十二名。在一对亲密的战友——战士康效君和车相律合用的手册上，记载着他们两个人从一九五二年的五月二十四日到十月九日，一共消灭了敌人五十四名的战绩。一九五二年十月十日，携带这个胜利手册的不朽的战士康效君在八五一高地上英勇地牺牲了。一颗子弹穿过了他们的手册。车相律就在这个“手册”上写下他的誓言：“强盗们，你虽然打穿了我们的手册，夺去我最亲密战友的性命，但他杀死你们的力量已完全化在我身上了，我必须在每一页弹孔的周围，记录上你们的死亡……。”果然，在这以后，就有二十多个敌人倒在这位英雄准确的火力面前。这位英雄的新战绩被写在手册上的弹孔周围了。朝鲜人民的胜利就是靠这些英雄们的记录积累起来的。
    每一个参观的人，都要在一面朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国旗下长久地注目致敬。它就是一九五
    一年朝鲜人民军粉碎敌人秋季攻势的东线战斗中，在加七峰上迎着胜利而飘扬的国旗。在国旗的周围陈列了许多永垂不朽的劳动党党员战士的党证。每个党证上都有枪洞或血迹。共和国英雄金昌杰在赴战之前，附在他党证上的豪语是：“我知道我这一去将会永别了我的祖国和人民，但是祖国和人民需要我这样，我只有感到光荣！”为了胜利，为了祖国国旗在祖国大地上飘扬，多少优秀的劳动党员流尽了他们最后的一滴血。光荣的劳动党员在战斗中的堡垒作用，这就是朝鲜人民获得伟大胜利的保证。
    在“序馆”的另一处，许多灿烂的锦旗簇拥着金日成元帅肖像。这些锦旗，有的来自莫斯科的工厂和西伯利亚的集体农庄，有的越过喀尔巴阡山来自蓝色的多瑙河岸，有的来自蒙古的广阔草原，其中更多的是来自五亿人民的新中国。整个世界和平民主阵营在庆祝朝鲜人民的胜利，在以他们的无比的力量支援朝鲜人民继续取得胜利。
    紧接着“序馆”的是“步兵馆”。这里的一切全用电气化装置。一按电纽，人们就可以明晰地看到朝鲜战争发展的四个时期和辉煌战绩。再按电纽人们又看到从一九五一年下半年起，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军守卫在“三八”线附近的钢铁般的“地下长城”里，粉碎敌人无数次大小进犯的胜利战斗。
    被特别标志出来的是东线一二一一高地和一○五二高地。这里就是世界闻名的美国侵略军自称为
    “伤心岭”的战地。
    从一九五一年的九月五日开始到十一月十一日为止，向这儿连续进攻的敌人遗弃的尸体就有一万五千九百多具。李奇微曾向这里发动所谓“焦土战术”，每天最少要向这地带发射三万发以上的炮弹，一直轰击了半个多月。九月以后，敌人又在这高地的每平方公尺的面积上平均每天投射七颗半重磅炸弹。敌人并曾驱使它最精锐的一八七伞兵团，海军陆战队第一师、美军步兵第三师等数万之众，投入攻势，但他们一次又一次地被中朝人民部队打得惨败。英雄们以钢铁般的意志胜利地执行了金日成元帅的命令：“不要退让一步。”
    在这儿展出的，有舍身堵住敌人枪眼的英雄李寿福和金明哲的血衣；有身负重伤而仍坚持战斗的炮长卢太振留下的血染的党证和他给最高司令官的一封信。信上写着：“我献出了最后的一滴血，光荣地坚守了祖国的高地。”
    展览室偏左的中央，高架着一挺重机枪。曾有十八个优秀射手使用过它，先后用它杀伤敌人一千七百三十八名。它的旁边还放着一支轮盘枪，英雄金作勋以这支枪喷出的火舌，杀伤了敌人二百七十八名。
    展览会在“步兵馆”之后，顺序排列着工兵、侦察兵、通讯、坦克、炮兵、海军、空军、汽车运输以及政治文化、后方等馆。每个馆都有非常丰富的内容。通过展览的各种图表、模型和实物，完全说明了朝鲜人民军虽然只有短短的五年建军历史，但它在反侵略战争的考验和锻炼中，已成长为一支有着高度军事素养、正规化现代化的英雄部队。
    每个馆都有数不尽的英雄事迹。
    在“侦察兵馆”中，出现了“双重英雄”李学文。他是人民军四个“双重英雄”之一。在三年多的战争中，他巧妙地活动在敌人的后方，取得了辉煌的胜利。他曾带了二十多名侦察兵，将敌人两个营的炮兵阵地全部摧毁，并歼敌六十余名。他曾不费一弹而机智地活捉了四十三名李伪军。他曾带领一个连深入敌后，活动一个多月，完成了侦察任务，并活捉包括两名美国军官在内的五十多个敌人。他的英雄事迹像神话一样吸引着每一个参观的人。
    在“通讯馆”里，也陈列着奇迹式的战绩。英勇的通讯兵们三年多中所跑的路程，仅就某一项通讯工作的统计，就可以绕地球转六百五十四个圈。
    “汽车运输馆”告诉了我们汽车司机们无数的英勇事例。他们设置在地下的汽车工厂战胜困难坚持工作，创造了机器和零件六百多种。
    看“工兵馆”的模型吧！大同江、沸流江、礼成江……在急湍奔流，江上的长桥架起来了，这是给吹嘘“空中优势”的敌人的最尖锐的讽刺。在离开敌人不到数百公尺，甚至数十公尺的地方，英雄们在开山掘石，修成了“地下长城”。展览会里陈列了战士们手造的一条坑道的模型，这里不仅是一个战斗的阵地，而且是一个包括有俱乐部、打铁炉、厨房、浴室等等的“战士之家”。战士们在这里英勇地作战，紧张地学习，愉快地生活。智勇双全的工兵们建筑坑道的艺术和劳动，提供了胜利的条件，为世界人民所传颂。
    和英雄们的战迹相对照，展览会中也陈列着一部分关于敌人遭受严重打击的材料。在敌人溃逃时所遗弃的一面印满敌人污秽脚印的美国星条旗旁边，摆着大量的敌人的五花八门的证件。有美国伊利诺斯州的“居住证”，也有在日本东京的“夜间通行证”和美军在菲律宾、西德、英国的什么证，还有用英文字母拼成中国字音的“投降证”和用十国文字印成的“遇难”恳求证件。
    这里更吸引人的，是无数缴自敌人的战利品。
    当参观者走进“胜利品展览馆”时，首先看到的是那些五颜六色的衣服。肩上绣有花葫芦的土耳其军服，土红色的“F八○”驾驶员服，美海军陆战队第一师军服，墨绿的荷兰军服，以僧帽为帽花的美海军防水服，花绿颜色的英军伪装服，横三竖四全是拉索的“B二十六”驾驶员服，六个扣子的希腊服，有樱花为记的特务服，其他菲律宾的，法兰西的，澳大利亚的，几乎应有尽有了。还有血迹斑斑的“尼龙避弹衣”，这是美国将军们用来骗使士兵送命的一种“法宝”。接着，参观的人们就可以看到那些缴获的军械展览品了。成百上千的武器，标志着美国侵略者杀人的“科学文明”。这里有小到一个小口袋里可以装下好几支的那种专门用于暗杀的手枪，也有大炮、坦克和飞机。还有专门用来杀害儿童的像玩具一样的烈性炸弹，使每一个参观者看了都咬牙切齿。但武器挽救不了侵略者的失败。现在它们在展览会会场上排列得整整齐齐，成了朝鲜人民的战利品。像那四十五吨重的美国“巴顿式”坦克，有的已被我军的反坦克武器打得百孔千疮，有的却完完整整地——连上面绿油油的亮漆也没剥落一点——被夺到英雄的人民的手里来了。
    参观者看到那一排各式各样的敌机时，就不期而然地对那些毁灭了自己的城市和家园的强盗们表示万分的痛恨；同时，也更加怀念和敬仰自己的英雄们，他们把敌人的所谓“空中优势”的叫嚣打得粉碎。像著名的双重英雄金基禹，他曾在十六天中打落敌机十一架；后来李弼真又使用他那挺高射机枪，打落敌机五架而荣获“共和国英雄”称号。现在，这挺机枪摆在展览馆内，使每一个参观的人感到骄傲。
    这个异常丰富动人的“胜利展览会”，真实地显示着朝鲜人民军是光荣伟大的，不可战胜的。它是朝鲜人民军艰苦奋斗、英勇作战的胜利的缩影。它不仅告诉了我们胜利的伟大意义，而且告诉了我们胜利是如何取来的。
