Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th. Among the North Korean People's Army prisoners of war in Camp 48, who were unable to listen to explanations for three consecutive days due to special agent control, two escaped from the barbed wire today and were repatriated. Three other People's Army prisoners of war from two other camps escaped and were repatriated in the same manner. They said they would rather risk their lives to escape the barbed wire and request repatriation than wait for the explanations because the special agents controlling the POW camp threatened to kill anyone who went to listen to the explanations and applied for repatriation; moreover, they saw no sign that these special agents' control would be lifted in the past two or three days, allowing POWs to leave the camp and listen to the explanations.

Choi Moon-deok and Song Myung-ro, who escaped from Camp 48, told neutral nation observers and reporters in a rest tent in Panmunjom that on the morning of the 17th, when Indian troops called for POWs to leave the camp to listen to the explanations, Kang Kyung-ryul, the U.S. special agent and leader of the "Anti-Communist Youth Corps" in the POW camp, fearing that the POWs would apply for repatriation, gathered the POWs in the square and surrounded them with "guards" holding knives to prevent them from leaving. After the Indian troops surrounded the camp, Kang Kyung-ryul forced all the POWs to jump into trenches about one person high that had been dug in advance inside the tents to resist. He also said: The U.S. military is prepared behind the camp. If the Indian troops open fire and call for the POWs to listen to the explanations, the U.S. military will immediately resolve the Indian troops and protect you.

Choi Moon-deok said that several days ago, trenches to resist Indian troops were dug in every tent in Camp 48, and a large number of knives, wooden sticks, axes, iron shovels, and stones were prepared. From morning to 3:50 p.m. on the 17th, the special agents forced the POWs to stay in the trenches and were not allowed to come out. The special agent leader, Kang Kyung-ryul, told the POWs that the special agent armed forces would resist the Indian soldiers entering the camp. If the resistance failed, they should take up arms, rush out, destroy the explanation site, kill the explanation representatives, and then flee to the U.S. military area. He also said that if the riot failed and they had to listen to the explanations, they should take off their clothes, go in, and scold and act shamelessly. At the same time, special agents were deployed outside the tents, and if anyone applied for repatriation, they would intercept him on the way and kill him.

Choi Moon-deok said that after the 17th, the special agents' reign of terror over the POWs became even tighter, with "guards" carrying knives stationed every five meters along the barbed wire, and Indian troops were not allowed to enter the camp at all. The POWs were also strictly forbidden to leave the tents, and every POW who came out to relieve themselves was followed by a "guard."

Won Ko-seop, who escaped from Camp 52, said that when special agents in Camp 48 prevented POWs from leaving the camp to listen to the explanations, special agents in Camp 52 forced POWs to "demonstrate support" outside the tents; at the same time, an order came from Camp 51 saying that if Camp 48 insisted on going out to listen to the explanations, Camp 52 would rush out with POWs from other camps to eliminate the Indian troops and then flee south.

### 我方五名被俘人员突破特务控制遣返归来  沉重地打击了美方所谓战俘拒绝听取解释的谰言

    我方五名被俘人员突破特务控制遣返归来
    沉重地打击了美方所谓战俘拒绝听取解释的谰言
    【新华社开城十九日电】一连三天为特务控制未能听取解释的四十八号营场的朝鲜人民军被俘人员中，今天有两个人逃出铁丝网被遣返归来。以同样方式逃出来被遣返的还有另外两个营场的三名人民军被俘人员。他们说，他们宁愿冒着生命的危险逃出铁丝网要求遣返而不等到解释的时候，是因为控制战俘营的特务恐吓说，如果有人去听解释而且申请遣返的话，就要把他打死；而且他们两三天来还看不出这些特务的控制令被解除，而让战俘出营场来听取解释。
    从四十八号营场逃出来的崔文德、宋明鲁在板门店休息帐篷里对中立国观察人员和记者说，十七日晨，当印度军队叫战俘们出营场去听解释时，战俘营里的美国特务、“反共青年团”组长姜京烈怕战俘申请遣返，就把战俘们集合在广场上，由拿着刀子的“警备队”包围起来，不让出去。印度军队包围了营场后，姜京烈又强迫所有战俘跳进事先在帐篷里面挖好的约有一人高的壕沟里抗拒。他并且说：美军已在营场后面作好准备，如果印度军队开枪叫战俘去听解释，美军就会立即解决印度军队，保护你们。
    崔文德说，几天以前，四十八号营场各个帐篷都挖好了对抗印度军队的战壕，并且准备了大批刀子、木棒、斧子、铁锨和石块。十七日从早晨到下午三时五十分，特务们一直强迫战俘呆在战壕里，不准出来。特务头子姜京烈对战俘说，特务武装要抗拒印度兵进营场里来。如果抗拒不成，那么就要拿起武器，冲出去把解释场所捣毁，打死解释代表，然后向美军地区逃跑。他又说，如果暴动不成，非听解释不可，就要脱光衣服进去谩骂、耍无赖。同时在帐篷外面布置好特务，如果有人申请遣返就在半路上截住他，把他打死。
    崔文德说，十七日后，特务们对战俘的恐怖统治更加紧了，带着刀子的“警备队员”沿着铁丝网每隔五公尺就站一个岗，根本不准印度军队走进营场。战俘们也被严禁走出帐篷，出来大小便的每一个战俘都由一个“警备队员”跟着。
    从五十二号营场逃出来的元考燮说，当四十八号营场特务阻止战俘出营场听取解释时，五十二号营场的特务就强迫战俘到帐篷外面“示威声援”；同时，从五十一号营场又传来了命令说，如果四十八号营场一定要出去听解释，五十二号营场就要和其他营场的战俘一齐冲出去，消灭印度军队，然后向南逃跑。
