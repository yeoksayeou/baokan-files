Full Text of Lieutenant General Thimayya's Reply to Clark, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission

[Xinhua News Agency dispatch] The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission Chairman, Lieutenant General Thimayya, sent a letter to the United Nations Forces Commander, Clark, on October 7th, replying to the questions raised by Clark in his letter of October 5th. The full text of Lieutenant General Thimayya's reply is as follows:

Dear General Clark:

This Commission has instructed me to acknowledge receipt of your letter of October 5th, in which you kindly offered your opinions on certain aspects of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's activities. Although this Commission is not unaware of the complex and intricate negotiations that led to the formulation of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," the Commission is nevertheless grateful for your concise restatement of the background.

Your letter makes the difference in viewpoints between the United Nations Command and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the issues very clear, and it seems to be a rather fundamental difference. You stated: "The decisions and activities of your Commission, to date, seem to presuppose that all prisoners of war under your care are truly willing to be repatriated." This Commission has not made such an assumption. On the other hand, this Commission is not prepared to accept the following point as a fait accompli: "Korean and Chinese prisoners of war made their choice several months ago, and without force or coercion, the vast majority would adhere to their decision." This is indeed the assertion of the United Nations Command. On the other hand, the argument of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers is that these prisoners of war did not have the opportunity to express their free will because there were well-organized groups in the prisoner of war camps. These groups allegedly intimidated those prisoners of war who were willing to be repatriated. This Commission is not prepared to operate on either assumption. This Commission harbors no prejudice and is eager to ensure that prisoners of war have complete freedom to choose without compulsion or threat. Assuming that "the majority would adhere to their decision," how would this Commission discover the small number of people who might change their minds? It is precisely for this purpose that the commanders of both sides agreed to stipulate "explanations" in the terms of the agreement. This is a mandatory provision, and the Commission must, in accordance with its terms of reference, provide the necessary freedom and facilities to the explanation personnel. On the one hand, this Commission has the obligation to protect prisoners of war from the use of force and threats of force, and it also has the same obligation to ensure that the Commission fulfills its legitimate duties as conferred by its terms of reference.

It is possible that many prisoners of war will not request repatriation, but the fact that approximately one hundred and ten prisoners of war have requested repatriation to date proves that at least some prisoners of war do wish to be repatriated. The more important fact is that no prisoner of war in the camps dares to openly request repatriation. They must do so secretly, either at the risk of being killed or injured by other prisoners of war, or at the risk of being shot dead by armed guards on the barbed wire. The abnormal manner in which repatriated prisoners of war must express their wishes naturally leads one to doubt that all prisoners of war are free individuals. In such circumstances, I hope you will appreciate why this Commission cannot fully acknowledge the fact that Korean and Chinese prisoners of war made their choice several months ago; nor can it fully acknowledge that, without force or coercion, the vast majority would adhere to their decision. This Commission certainly guarantees that no force or coercion will be used during the explanations, but this Commission cannot convince itself that the prisoners of war are not currently being subjected to force or coercion by other prisoners of war.

You have suggested that prisoners of war should be encouraged to directly present their views to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission or its subsidiary bodies in order to eliminate any doubt about the true attitude of the prisoners of war. In the course of my conversations with the leaders of the prisoners of war, I did ask them if they would agree to come to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to express their views, but they were not even prepared to agree to this. Clearly, these leaders do not trust the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, or they fear that once a prisoner of war is allowed to be alone in a place, he will change his mind and decide to request repatriation. Therefore, this method of understanding the attitude of prisoners of war that you suggested is not feasible for us.

You certainly have the right to expect the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to fulfill the obligations given to it by the Armistice Agreement and the terms of reference, and to expect it to strictly adhere to the humanitarian intentions of these documents. This Commission believes that it has done so, and to date it has fully complied with the responsibilities given to it by its terms of reference, without doing anything that could be considered as tolerating or hindering the principle of prisoners of war having freedom of choice regarding their future. This Commission has noted the measures taken by the United Nations Command to notify prisoners of war of the provisions of the terms of reference. However, it appears that these prisoners of war do not adequately understand these provisions. The following examples illustrate this point. In his letter of September 12th to me, General Harrison stated that the United Nations Command had told the prisoners of war that no observers should be present when the Indian Custodial Forces took over. This Commission unanimously believes that this interpretation is incorrect. The prisoners of war also stated that according to the terms of reference, they do not have to attend explanations, and they will be automatically released at the end of the ninety days. The correct situation is that they must remain in custody until the political conference resolves the issue of their disposition. In this situation, the Commission believes it is necessary to distribute a leaflet explaining the provisions of the terms of reference in order to eliminate this misunderstanding. I admit that when I received General Hamblen's letter, I thought that the initial draft, which was later revised by the Commission, might have been translated into Chinese due to negligence. I said this in a casual conversation with a journalist. I also told him that I had returned the statement to the Commission's translators to check and give me a report, and I was waiting for this report at the time. However, this journalist was unwilling to report the entire conversation. Upon receiving the translators' report, I was satisfied that this error did not exist and that the Chinese text was a faithful translation of the English text that the Commission finally approved.

I admit that I did not understand the purpose of distributing the leaflet about the Indian materials at the time. From what you say in your letter, I now fully understand the purpose and necessity of distributing this leaflet.

This Commission has noted that the United Nations Command cannot agree to extend the deadline beyond what is stipulated in the terms of reference. This Commission has not suggested anywhere that this is a matter for the Commission to interpret. This Commission is fully aware that any such extension is only possible with the agreement of both sides. However, in view of the delay in providing explanation facilities, this Commission believes that both sides should be requested to agree to an extension.

This Commission carefully considered the matter of allowing observers to watch the coming into effect. Although questioning prisoners of war may be considered a task of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the coming into effect is definitely not a task of the Commission. It is obviously impossible for practical reasons to separate these two functions. Therefore, this Commission cannot agree to allow observers to attend the coming into effect. However, I would like to point out that, just as observers were allowed to attend when the Indian Custodial Forces took over the prisoners of war, this Commission has also agreed that observers will be present when the prisoners of war are finally transferred and repatriated.

This Commission fully believes that the United Nations Command will continue to fulfill its commitments, and can assure the United Nations Command that this Commission is fully aware of its responsibilities and will continue to fulfill its obligations with complete integrity, absolute fairness, and a full understanding of the matter involved, keeping in mind the history of the prisoner of war issue.

### 中立国遣返委员会主席  蒂迈雅中将给克拉克的复信全文

    中立国遣返委员会主席
    蒂迈雅中将给克拉克的复信全文
    【新华社讯】    中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将在十月七日致函联合国军总司令克拉克，答复克拉克在十月五日信中所提的各项问题。蒂迈雅中将的复信全文如下：亲爱的克拉克将军：
    本委员会要我通知已收到你十月五日的来信，承蒙你在来信中对中立国遣返委员会活动的某些方面提出了你的意见，虽然本委员会并非不知道导引至拟订“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的交综错杂的谈判过程，但本委员会还是感谢你把背景扼要地重述了一遍。
    你的来信使联合国军和中立国遣返委员会对问题看法的分歧成为很鲜明，看来还是相当基本的分歧。你曾说：“贵委员会的决定与活动，到今天为止，好像都是预先假定在你看管下的战俘都当真是愿意遣返的”，本委员会并不曾作过这样的假定。另一方面本委员会不准备接受下列一点作为既成事实，即：“朝鲜籍与中国籍战俘好几个月以前就作了选择，如果没有武力或胁迫的话，绝大多数人将坚持他们的决定”。这的确是联合国军的主张。另一方面，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的论点是：这些战俘没有表示他们自由意志的机会，因为在战俘营中存在着组织严密的团体。据称这些团体对那些愿意遣返的战俘进行恫吓。本委员会不准备以任何一个假定来进行工作。本委员会不存任何偏见，并渴望保证战俘有不受强迫、不受威胁进行选择的完全自由。假定“大多数人将坚持他们的决定”，本委员会又怎样来发现一小部分可能改变他们决定的人呢？正是为了这个目的，双方司令官才同意在协定的条款中规定“解释”，这是强制性的规定，而本委员会必须根据职权范围提供解释人员必要的自由与便利。本委员会一方面有义务保护战俘不遭受武力和武力的威胁，而它也有同样的义务注意使委员会执行职权范围所赋予的合法职司。
    有可能很多战俘将不要求遣返，但到现在为止已有约一百一十个战俘要求遣返，这证明至少有些战俘确是希望被遣返的，更重要的事实是在营中没有一个战俘敢于公开要求遣返，他们必须秘密地如此作，或是冒着被其他战俘打死或打伤的危险，或是冒着被武装警卫打死在铁丝网上的危险。遣返的战俘在表达愿望时所必需采取的不正常的方式，使人们很自然地怀疑到全体战俘都不是自由的个人。在这样的情况下，我希望你将能体会为什么本委员会不能完全承认这一事实，即：朝鲜籍与中国籍战俘好几个月以前就作了选择；也不能完全承认，如果没有武力或胁迫的话绝大多数人将坚持他们的决定。本委员会当然保证在解释时将不施以武力或胁迫，但本委员会不能使自己相信战俘们不是正在受到其他某些战俘的武力或武力胁迫。
    你曾建议，应鼓励战俘直接向中立国遣返委员会或其附属机构陈述他们的意见，以便将关于战俘们真正态度的一个怀疑消除。在我与战俘的首领们谈话的过程中，我确曾问他们是否同意到中立国遣返委员会来表达他们的意见，即使这一点他们都不准备同意。显然，这些首领们不相信中立国遣返委员会，或是他们害怕一旦一个战俘被容许独自在一处，他会改变他的主意而决定要求遣返。因此你所建议的这个了解战俘态度的方法，对我们是行不通的。
    你当然有权期望中立国遣返委员会完成停战协定及职权范围所给予它的义务，并期望它严密地遵守这些文件的人道意图。本委员会认为：委员会已经这样做了，并到现在为止它完全遵照了职权范围所给予它的责任，没有做任何事情可以被认为是容忍了或妨害了战俘对他们的未来有选择自由的原则。本委员会注意到联合国军为了将职权范围的规定通知战俘所采取的措施。但看来这些战俘没有适当地了解这些规定。下列事例可以说明这一点。哈利逊中将在九月十二日给我的信里说：联合国军已告诉战俘们在印度看管部队接管他们的时候，不应有观察代表在场。本委员会一致认为，这种解释是不正确的。战俘也说：根据职权范围，他们不必出席解释，九十天终了时他们就会自动地被释放。而正确的情况是：在政治会议解决了关于他们的处理问题以前，他们仍须留在看管之下。在这种情况下，委员会认为有必要分发一种解释职权范围规定的传单，以消除这种误解。我承认当我收到汉布伦将军的来信时，我以为后来经委员会修正的初稿可能因为疏忽已经被译成了中文，在一次与一位新闻记者的偶然谈话中我就曾这样说过。我还告诉他我已将该声明再次交给委员会的翻译人员去查对并给我一个报告，当时我还在等待这个报告。但是这位新闻记者却不愿报道全部的谈话。在收到翻译人员的报告时，我感到满意的是这种错误并不存在，中文文本是本委员会最后通过的英文文本的忠实译文。
    我承认，我当时不了解分发关于印度的材料的传单的目的。从你来信中所说的，我现在完全了解散发这种传单的目的和必要。
    本委员会注意到联合国军不能同意将期限延长到超出职权范围所规定的，本委员会没有在什么地方建议过这是由本委员会来解释的事情。本委员会完全知道任何这种延期只有双方同意才是可能的。但是考虑到提供解释设备有所迟延，本委员会认为应该请求双方同意延期。
    本委员会仔细地考虑了允许观察人员观看生效的问题，虽然询问战俘可能被认为是中立国遣返委员会的一种工作，但是生效却决不是委员会的一种工作。由于实际的理由要把这两种职司分开显然是不可能的。因此本委员会不能同意允许观察人员在生效时出席，然而我愿意指出：正如在印度看管军接管战俘时准许观察人员出席，本委员会也已同意在战俘最后被移交并遣返时有观察人员在场。
    本委员会完全相信联合国军将继续履行其承诺，并且可以向联合国军保证：本委员会完全知道它所承担的责任，并将以完全的正直、绝对的公平，和对于所涉及的事的完全了解，并记住战俘问题的历史，来继续履行其义务。
    中立国遣返委员会主席
    蒂迈雅中将（签名）
