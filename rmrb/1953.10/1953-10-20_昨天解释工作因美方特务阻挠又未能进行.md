Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th—All thirty-two explanation tents in Dongchang-ri were empty today because Rhee Syngman special agents, who had infiltrated the prisoner-of-war camps, continued to prevent Korean People's Army prisoners from coming to hear explanations, in accordance with the US plan to counter explanations. Explanation work has failed to proceed for another day.

Since the beginning of the explanation work, not a single Korean People's Army prisoner has had the opportunity to hear an explanation. Today, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission attempted to arrange the explanation work according to the plan proposed by the Korean-Chinese side, but it was disrupted by Rhee Syngman agents for the third time.

When reporters arrived at Dongchang-ri in the chilly morning, they saw a black US reconnaissance plane flying back and forth in the northeast sky. Across the hills came the frantic shouts and noisy drumbeats and bugle sounds from inside the prisoner-of-war camp. This blatant US practice of militarily threatening the prisoners and directing special agent forces to run amok obstructed the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

Just as the US was stepping up its efforts to instigate Rhee Syngman special agents to do their utmost to prevent Korean People's Army prisoners from hearing explanations, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission handed over five Korean People's Army prisoners to the Korean-Chinese side this afternoon. These prisoners risked their lives to climb over the barbed wire fence to request repatriation. This fact dealt a heavy blow to the US propaganda machine's slander that prisoners refused to listen to explanations.

The Korean-Chinese side has notified the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission today that it will continue to provide explanations to Korean People's Army prisoners in the original camp tomorrow.

### 昨天解释工作因美方特务阻挠又未能进行

    昨天解释工作因美方特务阻挠又未能进行
    【新华社开城十九日电】今天东场里三十二个解释帐篷内空无一人，因为混入战俘营中的李承晚特务分子按照美方的反解释计划继续阻止朝鲜人民军被俘人员前来听取解释，解释工作又有一天未能进行。
    自解释工作开始以来，还没有一个朝鲜人民军被俘人员得到听取解释的机会。今天中立国遣返委员会曾企图按朝中方面提出的计划安排解释工作，但第三次遭到了李承晚特务的破坏。
    记者在清冷的早晨到达东场里时，看见东北方向的上空有一架黑色的美方侦察机来回飞行。隔着山岗传来了战俘营场内疯狂的喊叫声和噪杂的鼓声和喇叭声。美方这种明显地对战俘进行军事威胁和指使特务势力胡作非为的作法，使中立国遣返委员会的工作遭到了阻碍。
    正当美方加紧鼓动李承晚特务分子竭力阻止朝鲜人民军战俘听取解释的时候，中立国遣返委员会在今天下午将五名冒着生命危险翻越铁丝网要求遣返的朝鲜人民军战俘遣交给朝中方面。这个事实沉重地打击了美方造谣机器所谓战俘拒绝听取解释的谰言。
    朝中方面今天已通知中立国遣返委员会，明天仍将向原定营场的朝鲜人民军战俘进行解释。
