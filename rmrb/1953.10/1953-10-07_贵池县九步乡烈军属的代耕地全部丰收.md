    All Farmland Cultivated on Behalf of Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Soldiers in Jiubu Township, Guichi County, Reaped a Bumper Harvest
    Yu Dunkui of the People's Government of Guichi County, Anhui Province, writes: Jiubu Township in Dingxiang District of our county correctly implemented the policy of cultivation on behalf of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, resulting in a bumper harvest on all cultivated land, with the highest yield reaching 927 jin per mu.
    In February of this year, Jiubu Township, in conjunction with the issuance of memorial certificates for veterans in old revolutionary areas, repeatedly explained the policy of cultivation on behalf of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers at symposiums for these families. Twenty-three out of the twenty-nine families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in the township declared on the spot that they did not need assistance with cultivation. Therefore, the scope of those receiving such assistance was appropriately reduced (accounting for only 30 percent of last year), while the scope of those bearing the responsibility for such cultivation was expanded compared to last year. Township cadres who did not separate themselves from production, with the exception of the deputy township head, all members of the township government committee and the militia shouldered the responsibility for cultivation on behalf of others. The burden of cultivation on behalf of others for each labor force in the township was reduced, averaging only one and a half workdays. The land of the six families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers receiving assistance with cultivation was contracted to seven perennial mutual aid teams, and contracts were signed to ensure an average increase in production of 9 percent on the basis of last year's bumper harvest. Due to meticulous cultivation and sufficient fertilization, the rice paddies generally grew well. For example, the Li Longde Mutual Aid Team, which contracted to cultivate Cao Chuanbo's 4.7 mu of land, ensured two plowings, two harrowings, two fine harrowings, and four weedings. They used the method of planting seedlings with small spacing and high density, and applied oil cake, mountain grass, ash manure, and gypsum as fertilizer. In order to prevent lodging, they also twisted ropes and erected wooden stakes, building frames in the fields. Although there were two major wind and rainstorms in August, the crops were not damaged, and a total of 2,674 jin of rice was harvested, exceeding the original contracted yield by 30 percent. The Shi Laxi Mutual Aid Team, which contracted to cultivate Cheng Genmiao's 0.8 mu of land (family of a soldier), achieved a yield of 927 jin per mu. The Jiao Xinlai Mutual Aid Team, which contracted to cultivate Liu Yimin's 2.2 mu of land (family of a soldier), achieved a yield of 717 jin per mu, both exceeding the yields of neighboring fields.

### 贵池县九步乡烈军属的代耕地全部丰收

专栏：读者来信摘要

    贵池县九步乡烈军属的代耕地全部丰收
    安徽省贵池县人民政府余敦奎来信：我县丁香区九步乡正确执行了代耕政策，使代耕土地全部得到丰收，最高产量每亩达九百二十七市斤。
    今年二月间，九步乡结合颁发老区烈士纪念证，在烈军属座谈会上，反复讲解了代耕政策。全乡二十九户烈军属有二十三户当场自报不要代耕。因此享受代耕的面适当缩小（仅占去年的百分之三十），负担代耕的面却较去年扩大了，不脱离生产的乡干部，除副乡长外，其余乡政府委员、民兵都全部负担了代耕。全乡每个劳动力的代耕负担减轻了，平均只负担代耕工一个半。享受代耕的六户烈军属的土地，分别由七个常年互助组包耕；并商订合同，保证在去年丰收基础上平均增产百分之九。由于耕作细致，施肥足，稻田普遍生长良好。如李龙德互助组包耕烈属曹传伯的四亩七分田，做到了犁二、耙二、耖二、耘四，用小株密植法插秧，下了油饼、山草、灰粪、石膏做肥料；为了防止倒伏，又搓绳打木桩，在田里搭了架子，八月份虽经两次大风雨侵袭，也未受损失，共收稻二千六百七十四斤，超过原包产量百分之三十。施腊喜互助组包耕军属程根苗八分田，每亩产量合九百二十七斤。焦新来互助组包耕军属刘以民的田二亩二分，每亩产量达七百一十七斤，都超过了四邻田的产量。
