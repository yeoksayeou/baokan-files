	More than 5,000 Cadres in Shaanxi Province Participate in Cultural Studies
	Under the leadership of Party and government leading organs at all levels, amateur cultural schools for cadres have been established in six special districts (SuiDe, Yulin, Yan'an, Baoji, Weinan, and Ankang) and fifteen counties and cities of Shaanxi Province, as well as in provincial-level organs. More than 5,300 on-the-job cadres with lower levels of education who are unable to participate in theoretical studies have been organized to participate in cultural learning. Students are assigned to junior high school classes, senior elementary school classes, and literacy classes according to their educational level. Party and government leading organs at all levels have also appointed dedicated personnel to be responsible for the leadership of the schools. In addition to the allocation of forty-eight part-time teachers, forty full-time teachers have also been assigned to be specifically responsible for teaching. At present, cadre amateur cultural schools in various parts of Shaanxi Province are gradually establishing and improving various necessary systems and organizations, so that the schools gradually become standardized.
	Beijing History Museum Holds "Bingling Temple Grottoes Photo Exhibition"
	The "Bingling Temple Grottoes Photo Exhibition" room at the Beijing History Museum has officially opened. The Bingling Temple Grottoes are located in Yongjing County, Gansu Province, and they preserve exquisite carvings and murals from various dynasties from the 4th to the 7th centuries. In the last seven or eight decades, this grotto has suffered considerable damage. It was rediscovered in the autumn of 1951 after liberation. In 1952, the Central Ministry of Culture and the Northwest Ministry of Culture organized experts to conduct a survey. According to the initial survey, the Bingling Temple Grottoes have a total of 124 caves and niches, containing exquisite stone statues from the Wei and Tang dynasties and murals from the Song and Ming dynasties. The survey team conducted precise surveying, mapping, photography, and tracing work here. The exhibition at the Beijing History Museum showcases the fruits of the survey team's diligent labor.

    北京历史博物馆举办“炳灵寺石窟图片展览”
    北京历史博物馆“炳灵寺石窟图片展览”室已正式开放。炳灵寺石窟在甘肃省永靖县内，它保存着由第四到第七世纪历代精美的雕刻和壁画。近七八十年间，这个石窟曾遭受到相当严重的破坏。它之重新被发现，是在解放后的一九五一年秋天。一九五二年，中央文化部和西北文化部组织专家们前往勘查。据初步勘查，炳灵寺石窟共有一百二十四个窟龛，里面有魏、唐的精美石雕像和宋、明的壁画。勘查团在这里曾进行了精确的测绘、摄影和临摹工作。北京历史博物馆展出的，就是勘查团辛勤劳动的成果。
