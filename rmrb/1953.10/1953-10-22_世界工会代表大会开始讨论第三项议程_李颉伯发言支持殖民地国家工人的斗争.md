Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 21st: The Third World Federation of Trade Unions Congress began discussing Veiga de Carvalho’s report at its meeting on the 19th.

    At the morning session, Yula Hojayev, representative of the trade unions of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, and Emo Kokeni, representative of the workers of Albania, spoke successively, pointing out that their countries were backward colonies and semi-colonies before liberation, but after liberation, industrial and agricultural production had rapidly increased and people's lives had been greatly improved. Hojayev said that Soviet workers warmly sympathize with the just struggle of the colonial laboring people for freedom and national independence, and agree with the WFTU's activities to provide assistance to trade unions in colonial and dependent countries.

    Diallo, General Secretary of the Sudanese Workers' Federation and Vice-President of the World Federation of Trade Unions, said in his speech that French, British, Belgian, Portuguese and Spanish colonialists had fragmented the African continent. They attempt to turn Africa into a military base and source of raw materials, and to turn the African people into cannon fodder. In Africa, racial discrimination exists in terms of wages, employment, private and social life, and social laws.

    Algerian representative Rakdar Kaidi then spoke, saying that Algerian workers know that the main reason for their poverty is the colonial system. Therefore, on the one hand, they are fighting to meet their social and economic demands, and at the same time, they are actively participating in the struggle for freedom and national independence. Workers' organizations played a major role in the establishment of the Freedom Defense Front in 1951 and actively participated in the activities organized by this front.

    Representatives from Israel, Belgium, French Guinea, Paraguay, Cameroon, Guatemala, Jordan and Sudan also spoke at the morning session.

    At the afternoon session, Chinese representative Li Jiebo rose to speak amidst warm applause from the audience. He first stated that the Chinese working class is deeply concerned about the tragic situation currently encountered by the working-class brothers in colonial and semi-colonial countries, as well as their heroic struggles to defend world peace, for national independence, to improve their living conditions, and to fight for democratic rights. He said that the reason why the Chinese working class has such deep sympathy is that the Chinese workers and the Chinese people were liberated from a semi-colonial situation. Now, the Chinese people have stood up. The era when foreign imperialism bullied the Chinese people has been declared over forever. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, with the support of the peace-loving people of the world, have achieved a great victory and forced the United States to accept the armistice agreement. This shows that the era when Western aggressors arbitrarily occupied an Eastern country is gone forever.

    Li Jiebo expressed his warm support for Veiga de Carvalho's report. He said that based on their own experience, the Chinese workers deeply know that the struggle of the working-class brothers in colonial and semi-colonial countries is extremely arduous and complex. He firmly believes that the trade union organizations in these countries will be more united and will bravely and intelligently continue to lead the working masses in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle, defend the vital interests of the workers, establish closer ties with the broad masses of workers, further organize and educate the workers, constantly enhance their combat effectiveness, and, on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance, unite all patriotic democratic classes and patriotic people to form a broad united front for the struggle for independence, democracy and peace, and finally defeat imperialist aggression and obtain their own national independence and the liberation of the workers themselves and other working people.

    The liberation of Chinese workers and the great achievements of China's construction, especially the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea and the smooth start of the first five-year plan, have given great support and encouragement to the oppressed working-class brothers in various countries. We Chinese workers will continue to work hard to continuously strengthen the strength of the struggles of the working-class brothers in these countries and support their struggles with the achievements in building our motherland and a better life.

    Li Jiebo said that the struggle of the working class in colonial and semi-colonial countries will surely receive the sympathy and support of the Soviet Union, China, the people's democratic countries, and the working-class brothers in other countries and the home countries. The trade union movement in colonial and semi-colonial countries will surely further develop and grow stronger, and achieve more brilliant achievements in the struggle.

    Next, Jose Morella, representative of the Latin American Labor Federation, spoke. He said that the characteristic of the struggle of the Latin American laboring people in the past two years has been large-scale strikes and demonstrations. When striking, workers not only put forward economic demands, but also demanded the nationalization of important mines, the implementation of land reform, the reconstruction of trade relations with all countries in the world, and protested against the conclusion of military treaties with the United States. He finally assured the delegates that they would implement the policy of consistent action with greater determination and work tirelessly to implement the resolutions of this conference.

    Syrian representative Abdullah Hosseini and Lebanese representative Maum exposed the enslavement and plunder of these two countries by the American and British imperialists. Maum said that the Lebanese working class is organizing itself to strengthen the struggle against foreign enslavement.

    Alphonse Drua, representative of the French General Confederation of Labor, praised the national liberation struggles waged by the people oppressed by the French colonialists. He said that the French General Confederation of Labor will support all the demands of the colonial people. It is fighting not only for the interests of the French people, but also for the interests of the people of oppressed countries.

    Representatives from Costa Rica, Burma, Cyprus and Central Congo also spoke at the afternoon session.

    世界工会代表大会开始讨论第三项议程
    李颉伯发言支持殖民地国家工人的斗争
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：世界工会第三次代表大会十九日会议开始讨论维佳佳萨斯特拉的报告。
    在上午会议上，乌兹别克苏维埃社会主义共和国工会代表约拉·霍捷耶夫和阿尔巴尼亚工人代表艾莫·柯克尼先后发言，他们指出：他们国家解放前都是落后的殖民地和半殖民地，但在解放后，工业农业生产已迅速提高，人民生活已大大改善。霍捷耶夫说：苏联工人热情地同情殖民地劳动人民争取自由与民族独立的正义斗争，并同意世界工联对殖民地与附属国工会给予援助的活动。
    苏丹工人联合会总书记、世界工联副主席迪亚洛在发言中说：法国、英国、比利时、葡萄牙和西班牙殖民主义者把非洲大陆弄得四分五裂。他们企图把非洲变成一个军事基地和原料来源地，企图把非洲人民变成炮灰。在非洲，无论在工资、就业、私人生活和社会生活，以及社会法律方面都存在着种族歧视。
    阿尔及利亚代表拉克达尔·卡伊第接着发言，他说，阿尔及利亚工人知道使他们贫困的主要原因是殖民制度。因此，他们一方面为满足他们的社会与经济要求而斗争，同时也积极参加争取自由与民族独立的斗争。工人组织在一九五一年成立保卫自由阵线的工作中起了很大的作用，并积极参加了这个阵线所组织的活动。
    在上午会议上发言的还有以色列、比利时、法属几内亚、巴拉圭、喀麦隆、危地马拉、约旦和苏丹的代表。
    在下午会议上，中国代表李颉伯在全场热烈掌声中起立发言。他首先表示，中国工人阶级亲切地关怀着殖民地、半殖民地国家工人兄弟当前所遭遇的悲惨处境，以及他们为保卫世界和平、为民族独立、为改善自己生活条件、为争取民主权利所进行的英勇斗争。他说，中国工人阶级所以有这种深切的同情，是由于中国工人和中国人民是从半殖民地的状况下解放出来的。现在，中国人民已经站起来了。外国帝国主义欺负中国人民的时代已经永远宣告结束了。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在世界爱好和平人民的支援之下得到伟大的胜利，并迫使美国接受了停战协定。这说明了西方侵略者任意霸占一个东方国家的时代是一去不复返了。
    李颉伯表示热烈支持维佳佳萨斯特拉的报告。他说，中国工人基于自身的经验，深知殖民地、半殖民地国家工人兄弟的斗争，是异常艰苦和曲折复杂的。他深信这些国家的工会组织，将更加团结一致，勇敢机智地继续领导工人群众，进行反帝反封建的斗争，保卫工人切身利益，更加密切与广大工人群众的联系，进一步组织和教育工人，不断增强其战斗力，并在工农联盟的基础上，团结一切爱国的民主阶级和爱国人士，形成一个广泛的为独立、民主、和平而斗争的统一战线，最后击败帝国主义的侵略，获取自己民族的独立和工人自身以及其他劳动人民的解放。
    中国工人的解放和中国建设事业的巨大成就，特别是抗美援朝的胜利和第一个五年计划的顺利开始，已经给予被压迫各国工人兄弟以极大的支持和鼓舞，我们中国工人定将继续努力，以建设自己祖国和美好生活的事业上的成就，来不断增强这些国家工人兄弟斗争的力量，支持他们的斗争。
    李颉伯说，殖民地、半殖民地国家工人阶级的斗争，一定会得到苏联、中国、各人民民主国家以及其它各国和宗主国工人兄弟的同情和支援。殖民地、半殖民地国家的工会运动必将进一步发展壮大，并在斗争中取得更辉煌的成就。
    接着，拉丁美洲劳工联盟代表何塞·摩雷拉发言。他说，两年来拉丁美洲劳动人民斗争的特征就是大规模的罢工和示威。工人们在罢工时不仅提出经济要求，还要求把重要矿山收归国有，实行土地改革，与世界所有国家重建贸易关系，并抗议与美国缔结军事条约。他最后向代表们保证将以更大决心实行一致行动的政策，并将不停歇地工作来实现这次大会的决议。
    叙利亚代表阿卜杜拉·候赛尼和黎巴嫩代表毛姆揭露了美英帝国主义者对这两个国家的奴役和掠夺。毛姆说，黎巴嫩工人阶级正在把自己组织起来，加强反对外国奴役的斗争。
    法国总工会代表阿方斯·德鲁瓦赞扬被法国殖民者所压迫的人民所进行的民族解放斗争。他说，法国总工会将支持殖民地人民的所有要求。它不仅是为了法国人民的利益而斗争，也为了被压迫国家的人民    的利益而斗争。
    在下午会议上发言的还有哥斯达黎加、缅甸、塞浦路斯和中刚果的代表。
