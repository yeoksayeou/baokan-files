Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 26th. Our special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: The bilateral talks on the Korean political conference began in Panmunjom on the 26th. In order to ensure the success of the future political conference, the bilateral talks must, in addition to discussing the date and location of the political conference, also discuss and resolve the issue of the composition of the political conference. It is on this basis that the Korean and Chinese sides agreed to meet with the U.S. side in Panmunjom.

In the past two months, the Korean and Chinese sides, as well as broad world opinion, have repeatedly pointed out that the issue of the composition of the political conference will be the key to the success or failure of the conference. The U.S. government, in order to be able to be arrogant and unreasonable and act unilaterally in the political conference, making it difficult for the conference to reach an agreement, has tried its best to oppose the participation of neutral countries in the political conference, which shows that it lacks the necessary sincerity in withdrawing all foreign troops and peacefully resolving the Korean issue. Today's bilateral talks on the political conference provide the U.S. government with a new opportunity to adopt a consultative attitude on the issue of the composition of the political conference, in order to conform to the deep aspirations of peace-loving people around the world.

However, many signs revealed by the U.S. side on the eve of the bilateral talks indicate that the U.S. government has not changed its rigid stance on the membership issue. Although the U.S. government has clearly admitted that the bilateral talks should discuss the membership issue, officials in Washington have openly declared that the U.S. believes that the "dispute over the membership of the political conference has come to an end." If the Korean and Chinese sides raise this issue, "the United States will still take a firm stance" against the participation of neutral countries in the political conference.

At the same time, Arthur Dean, the representative appointed by the U.S. government to attend the bilateral talks, also declared arbitrarily in Tokyo that the United States would insist on opposing the discussion of the membership issue of the political conference, and openly overturned the U.S. government's promise to discuss the membership issue, saying that he was only authorized to discuss the issues of time and place.

Dean also arbitrarily predetermined a deadline for the bilateral talks. He said that the United States requires the bilateral talks to "make a decision within ten days or two weeks." He also said that if a decision cannot be made at that time, "we probably won't make a decision." The United States unilaterally announced the restriction of the duration of the talks on the eve of the bilateral talks, which is obviously a repeat of the old trick of sabotaging the negotiations during the armistice negotiations. Before the meeting has even started, it is already preparing to close, which shows that the U.S. government is unwilling to solve the problem in a spirit of consultation.

Dean emphasized at a press conference that the United States' purpose for the political conference is to unify Korea and promote the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers. When asked why he only wanted the Chinese People's Volunteers to withdraw, he said that this was because "the mutual defense treaty just signed between South Korea and the United States makes it difficult for American troops to leave the peninsula." And everyone knows that the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is a prerequisite for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The U.S. government now openly declares that it only requires the Chinese People's Volunteers to withdraw, while American soldiers still have to stay in Korea. Is this the performance of the United States wanting to hold a good political conference?

All these facts make people extremely suspicious that the United States does not want to hold a political conference. They have repeatedly predicted that a political conference may never be held. Their participation in the bilateral talks on the political conference is out of necessity, only a pretense to deceive public opinion. Childs, a columnist for the U.S. "Washington Post," once pointed out that the U.S. agreed to hold bilateral talks in Panmunjom merely "to dispel the doubts of European and Asian representatives in the United Nations, who have begun to feel that the United States does not want to hold a political conference." If the current strategy of the United States is to set up one obstacle after another for the bilateral talks and the political conference itself, so that the membership issue cannot be discussed and resolved, and the political conference cannot be successful or fails, then the peace-loving people of the world will never forgive the United States for its responsibility for sabotaging the political conference.

### 昨天开始的关于政治会议问题的双方会谈将严重考验美国政府对政治会议有无诚意

    昨天开始的关于政治会议问题的双方会谈将严重考验美国政府对政治会议有无诚意
    【新华社开城二十六日电】本社特派记者江南报道：朝鲜政治会议的双方会谈于二十六日开始在板门店举行。为了使未来的政治会议能够成功，双方会谈除了讨论政治会议的日期与地点以外，还必须讨论和解决政治会议的组成问题。朝中方面正是在这样一个基础上同意和美方在板门店开会的。
    在过去两个多月中间，朝中方面以及广泛的世界舆论已经一再指出，政治会议的组成问题将是会议成败的关键。美国政府为了便于在政治会议中蛮横无理、唯我独尊，使会议难于达成协议，竭力反对中立国家参加政治会议，这表明它对撤退一切外国军队，和平解决朝鲜问题缺乏应有的诚意。今天开始的关于政治会议的双方会谈，给了美国政府一个新的机会，来在政治会议组成问题上采取协商态度，以符合于全世界爱好和平的人民的深切愿望。
    但是，在双方会谈前夕美国方面透露出来的许多迹象表明：美国政府还没有改变它在成员问题上的僵硬立场。尽管美国政府早已明确承认双方会谈要讨论成员问题，华盛顿的官方人士却公开宣称，美国认为关于政治会议成员问题的“争论已告终结”。如果朝中方面提出这个问题，“美国仍将采取坚决态度”，反对中立国参加政治会议。
    同时，美国政府所指派的出席双方会谈的代表阿瑟·迪安也在东京独断地宣称：美国将坚持反对讨论政治会议的成员问题，并公然推翻美国政府关于讨论成员问题的诺言，说他只受权讨论时间和地点问题。
    迪安还专断地预先就给双方会谈定下一个期限。他说，美国要求双方会谈“在十天或两个星期之内作出决定”。他还说，如果在那时不能作出决定，“大概我们就不会作出决定了”。美国在双方会谈的前夕就片面宣布限制会谈的期限，这显然又是重施停战谈判时破坏谈判的故技。会还未开就要闭会，这就是美国政府不愿用协商精神解决问题。
    迪安在记者招待会上强调说，美国对于政治会议所怀抱的目的是统一朝鲜和促使中国人民志愿军撤退。当有人问他为什么只要中国人民志愿军撤退时，他说，这是因为“南朝鲜与美国刚刚签订的共同防御条约使美国军队很难撤离这个半岛”。而大家知道，从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队是和平解决朝鲜问题的先决条件。美国政府现在公然宣布它只要求中国人民志愿军撤退，而美国兵还要留在朝鲜。这难道是美国想开好政治会议的表现吗？
    所有这些事实，令人极端怀疑美国并不想举行政治会议。他们曾经一再预言政治会议可能永远不会举行。他们来参加政治会议的双方会谈是出于不得已的，只是一种装模作样的迷惑舆论的姿态。美国“华盛顿邮报”的专栏作家蔡尔兹曾经指出，美国同意在板门店举行双方会谈，仅仅是“为了要消除联合国中的欧、亚代表们的疑虑，他们已开始感觉到美国不想举行政治会议”。如果美国现在的策略是尽可能给双方会谈和政治会议本身安下一个又一个的障碍，来使成员问题不得讨论和解决，使政治会议开不成功或开得失败，那么全世界爱好和平的人民是绝不能饶恕美国破坏政治会议的责任的。
