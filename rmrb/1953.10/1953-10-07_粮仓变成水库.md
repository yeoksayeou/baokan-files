Granary Turns into Reservoir
    Zhan Tian
    In Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, Warehouse No. 1 has a newly built silo from last year. Because construction started late, it was not fully completed before the ground froze, so it became a carry-over project.

    This year, the higher-level leading departments have been "busy" with new warehouse construction work, and have long ignored this unfinished silo; local leaders also believe that this silo cannot be used yet, and have adopted an indifferent attitude. As a result, this carry-over project did not "carry over" with the new year, and still looks like it did last year—the bottom of the walls have small holes for grain removal, and the top has large holes for grain filling.

    The rainy season arrived, and the first rain filled the silo with water. Initially, comrades in the warehouse raised their concerns to the leaders, who found a few old reed mats to cover it. Soon, the reed mats were blown away by the wind, and no one paid attention to it after that. As a result, the silo often accumulated two or three inches of water. Recently, the continuous rain has been pouring in and flowing out... Many comrades have raised their concerns to the leaders of the Yangquan City Grain Company, but the reply they received was "The provincial department will make unified plans for repairs in the future, there is no need to worry about it now." In this way, a silo worth 80,000 jin of millet has been soaking in water for nearly half a year.

    The nearby masses are very dissatisfied with this behavior of not caring about state property. Some people lamented, "So much money was spent, and now they don't want the warehouse." Some people sarcastically said, "The Grain Company is really something, they actually have such a big reservoir!" Building a granary and turning it into a reservoir is absurd, but it is a true story.

    粮仓变成水库
    詹天
    山西阳泉市第一仓库有一座去年新建的池仓。因为开工较晚，尚未全部竣工，即已上冻，于是转为跨年度工程。
    今年以来，上级领导部门“忙”于新的建仓工作，长期没有理会这座未完工的池仓；当地领导上认为这座池仓还不能使用，也采取了漠不关心的态度。这样，这座跨年度的工程，并没有随着年度“跨”过来，仍然保持着去年的样子——墙根留着出粮的小洞，顶上留着灌粮的大洞。
    雨季到了，第一场雨就将池仓灌满了水。开始，库内同志向领导上提意见，找了几张旧苇席盖上了。不久，苇席被大风吹走，此后就再也没人过问了。因此，池仓内经常积水二、三寸深。最近，霪雨连绵，雨水不断地往里灌，又不断地向外流……。不少同志曾向阳泉市粮食公司领导上提过意见，但得到的答复是“将来省厅统一计划修理，现在无须管它”。就这样，一座价值八万斤小米的池仓在水里浸了将近半年之久。
    附近群众对这种不关心国家财产的行为很不满意。有的人惋惜地说：“花了许多钱，修下仓库就不要了。”有的人讽刺地说：“粮食公司真不简单，居然有这么大的水库！”修起粮仓做了水库，这是荒唐的事，然而却是真实的事。
