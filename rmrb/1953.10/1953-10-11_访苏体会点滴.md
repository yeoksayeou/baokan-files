    Glimpses of Impressions from a Visit to the Soviet Union
    Hua Luogeng, Member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Delegation to the Soviet Union
    During its visit to the Soviet Union, the Chinese Academy of Sciences delegation visited twenty units within eight departments and affiliated institutes of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. During this visit, every comrade in our delegation gained a lot of new knowledge and received extremely profound education. In this article, I will only report to the readers three points from the more complete fragments in my notebook, the more profound impressions in my memory, and the parts that are less related to specialized business. The first point will illustrate how, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Soviet science has advanced by leaps and bounds, and how the Party leads the Soviet Academy of Sciences from the science of old Russia in the Tsarist era to a process that makes Soviet science occupy the leading position in the world. The second point will explain how, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, Soviet mathematicians are advancing on a broad scientific front, and how their mathematical work has made concrete contributions to the people. The third point will provide examples to illustrate how Soviet mathematicians, based on the spirit of internationalism, care for and help us meticulously.
    Let me first describe the facts of the past. Old Russia was not lacking in outstanding great scientists, but due to the corruption of the Tsarist regime and its indifference to the development of science, by the eve of the October Socialist Revolution, the entire Russian Academy of Sciences had only one hundred and fifty-four scientific researchers. Detachment from the people was its characteristic. It did not combine with life but studied extremely empty problems.
    The great October Socialist Revolution shattered and eliminated the barrier between science and the people, bringing science closer to life and expanding the scope of scientific activities unprecedentedly.
    After the victory of the revolution, the Soviet regime affirmed the importance of science from the very beginning. The famous "Draft Plan for Scientific and Technical Work," personally written by Lenin in 1918, was the first call of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to lead scientists to serve the people. At that time, the Party also entrusted the Academy of Sciences with the task of studying and formulating plans for reorganizing the national industry and revitalizing the economy. However, the Academy of Sciences was not able to quickly eliminate the phenomenon of separation between theory and practice, as well as the tradition of choosing research topics based on personal interests. From 1929 onwards, the Soviet Academy of Sciences underwent reorganization under the leadership of the Party. During this reorganization, Kirov played a great role. He transformed the Academy of Sciences into a huge scientific institution with a unified purpose, guiding scientific research work throughout the Soviet Union.
    During the Great Patriotic War, Stalin's two telegrams to Komarov, the president of the Academy of Sciences, pointed out the basic direction of the Academy's work during the war. Due to Stalin's great call, Soviet scientists contributed all their strength to crushing the enemy's offensive.
    In 1946, Stalin stated: "I believe that as long as we give our scholars the necessary help, they will not only catch up with but also surpass the achievements of foreign science in the near future." Responding to Stalin's call, Soviet scientists actively engaged in and completed many extremely complex tasks in the implementation of the great Fifth Five-Year Plan, especially in the Stalin Plan for the Transformation of Nature. It was also at this time that the important characteristics of Soviet science were affirmed: comprehensively solving all major scientific and national economic tasks.
    At the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Malenkov called on all Soviet scientists: "Further develop advanced Soviet science and make it the first in the world." The Soviet Academy of Sciences accepted this glorious task. The Soviet Academy of Sciences is currently undertaking a huge task, namely, historically and comprehensively analyzing and studying the achievements of all scientific fields in the world, in order to select the main directions of scientific development and determine key issues. Soviet scientists are making every effort to bring science closer to the practice of communist construction, closer to industrial production, absorb the experience of industrial and production innovators, and solve huge, key theoretical scientific problems on this basis.
    Why has the Soviet Academy of Sciences achieved leap-forward development in the last thirty years, transitioned from scientific research that is detached from reality to scientific research that serves the people, and moved from a situation where it accounted for a small proportion in the world to today's requirement of occupying the first position in the world? Undoubtedly, the superior socialist system and the correct leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are the most important reasons. The above facts fully illustrate how the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has led scientists step by step out of the old shackles, from one victory to another, until it has reached the highest peak of Soviet science in human history and in the world. This fact has educated and inspired us, making us more deeply aware that only by relying on the Party and under the correct leadership of the Party can we move towards brightness, towards victory, and from the current state of scientific backwardness towards a future of scientific prosperity.
    I am not unfamiliar with the research work of Soviet mathematical science. Since 1935, I have been captivated by the depth of Soviet mathematics, especially the brilliant achievements of Academician Vinogradov, the banner of the Soviet mathematical community and a Hero of Socialist Labor, whom I have been studying for more than ten years, feeling that "I look up to him in front, and he is suddenly behind." I have realized that Soviet mathematics has the characteristic of seeking new methods from specific problems. This trip to the Soviet Union has further broadened my horizons and allowed me to understand another aspect of Soviet mathematics—its breadth. I have concretely experienced the role of Marxism-Leninism in various sciences—namely, the correlation and integrity between sciences.
    Of course, I knew Academician Lavrentyev's reputation. In the past, I only knew some of his contributions in complex variable function theory and functional analysis. However, when we talked about computational mathematics during our visit to the Soviet Union, I learned that Academician Lavrentyev is not only an expert in theoretical mathematics in the mathematics department and the head of the numerical calculation institution, but also a mechanics expert, and he has also made great contributions in seismology. This surprised me very much. For several years, in the groups of bourgeois scholars I have been in contact with, I have often heard that modern scientific division of labor is too detailed, and each scientist can only study a very small and specialized part of it! Influenced by this kind of thinking, I would of course be shocked by Lavrentyev's breadth.
    Not only is Academician Lavrentyev like this, but other scientists such as Academician Kolmogorov, Academician Sobolev, and Academician Petrovsky have also made contributions in many fields. This makes me have to think about the root cause. Why are there so many well-rounded talents in the Soviet Union, which scholars in capitalist countries believe is impossible to produce in modern science? In my experience, this is entirely because Soviet scientists have a profound ideological foundation of Marxism-Leninism. Under the guidance of this thought, Soviet scientists pay close attention to the combination of theory and practice, and the combination of teaching and research work. Under the guidance of this thought, Soviet scientists often pay attention to the correlation between various sciences. Therefore, in the Soviet Union, mathematics is no longer a number of isolated peaks, but an organic part of the organic whole of science.
    Of course, there are many more places where I have experienced the help that Marxism-Leninism gives to scientists in the Soviet Union, and I cannot describe them all one by one. But just what I have said above is enough to make our Chinese scientists realize the necessity of studying Marxism-Leninism. Only by mastering Marxism-Leninism can we avoid going down a narrow path, avoid being deceived by agnosticism, and overcome all difficulties to reach the level of Soviet scientists.
    Chairman Mao's works have had a significant impact among Soviet scientists. They told us: If you encounter difficulties, you can find solutions in Chairman Mao's works.
    The love and care of Soviet scientists for us are endless. They introduced their advanced experience to us with exceptional sincerity, for fear that we would take any detours. In the Soviet Union, time is very precious. But when we raised questions, they never hesitated to spend time, introducing their valuable experience to us in detail. Many of these are not only of great significance to China's scientific research work today, but also of inexhaustible benefit to us throughout our lives.
    I will now only take Vinogradov, the director of the Institute of Mathematics, as an example to illustrate the care of Soviet scientists for us. He is meticulously concerned about the development of our mathematics. He started with secondary school mathematics education; he cares about our textbooks; he mentioned secondary school mathematics groups; he also introduced the mathematics competition of students in grades eight to ten in Soviet secondary schools, and told us how to select young people with special potential for mathematics from the competition to enter the mathematics department of the university. In the university mathematics department, we must start from cultivating students' research ability, and talk about how mathematics should develop and how Chinese mechanics should develop. If you think about it carefully, you will find that he has provided valuable advice for every important key to the development of Chinese mathematics.
    Not only that, but even some examples that were mentioned casually, Vinogradov talked about them very specifically and kindly. For example, when he talked about how to cultivate young scholars in a planned way, he said: "Some young mathematicians like to study abstract algebra, topology, and real variable function theory, but do not like to study complex variable function theory, differential equation theory, etc. But those who do mathematics leadership work have a responsibility to persuade them and let them go to departments that have practical connections with the construction of the motherland."
    When talking about the direction of mathematics development, he gave such an example, saying: It is not good if there is only topology but no differential equations in an institute; it is okay if there are only differential equations but no topology. What the motherland needs is what we should focus on.
    I think the meaning of this passage is to explain that our focus should be based on the interests of the people. At the same time, it also shows that the need for the development of differential equations is more urgent than topology, but it does not mean that topology is not important. As for the achievements of topology in our country, that is certain.
    After Academician Vinogradov said this, he was afraid that we would go down the wrong path, and he added: "The mathematics we need to develop is in all aspects. Because some departments are not very important today, but they may be useful in the future." From here, we can see how concerned Academician Vinogradov is about the development of Chinese mathematics, and how concerned he is that Chinese mathematics can embark on a more effective path to serve the people. This reminds me of a story that someone told in the past: In 1946, when the Institute of Mathematics of the pseudo-Central Research Institute was about to be established, in order to determine the direction of mathematics development, they consulted an American "authoritative" scholar on the issue of Chinese mathematics development. The suggestion of this "authority" was: "The best way for the development of Chinese mathematics is to find a department that has relatively little relationship with other sciences and is easy to develop, and concentrate all efforts on research and development. This will easily occupy a position in the world. Send well-trained young people to our Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton for further study. Your institute can be regarded as our branch in the Far East." Based on this suggestion, the Institute of Mathematics of the pseudo-Central Research Institute decided to focus solely on combinatorial topology, ignoring other departments of mathematics, and even more neglecting departments that had direct connections with applications. This suggestion hindered the development of our country's mathematical scientific research work.
    In contrast, Soviet mathematicians always educate us with the premise that mathematical research work must be combined with the needs of the country's construction, hoping that we will take care of everything, instructing us that we must carry out work with a focus, and this focus must be placed on the departments that the motherland needs; instructing us to broaden our horizons, look far ahead, and see what will be needed in a few years. They care for us in this way, for fear that we will take detours. They introduce their experience to us one by one, specifically and deeply, giving us the confidence that we will definitely be able to develop scientific undertakings, and also teach us a series of working methods to achieve this goal. Who our good friends are is very clear.
    From the above points, I fully realize that scientists in New China should always follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. In this way, Chinese science can go from one victory to another, just like Soviet science. We should take Soviet scientists as examples, strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, and strive to enrich and comprehensively develop our country's scientific undertakings. I firmly believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and with the help of Soviet scientists, the scientific undertakings of New China will be greatly developed.

    访苏体会点滴
    中国科学院访苏代表团团员  华罗庚
    中国科学院访苏代表团在访苏期间，访问了苏联科学院所属八个部及其所属研究所中的二十个单位。在这次访问中，我们代表团每一位同志都获得了不少新的知识，受到了极其深刻的教育。本文中仅将我记事册中较完整的片段，记忆中较深刻的印象，和与专门业务关系较少的部分，提出三点向读者报道。第一点将说明在苏联共产党领导之下，苏联科学怎样地突飞猛进，党怎样领导苏联科学院，从沙皇时代的旧俄罗斯的科学进入使苏联科学在世界上占居首位的过程。第二点将说明在马克思列宁主义的思想指导下，苏联数学家怎样在宽广的科学战线上推进，他们的数学工作怎样地为人民作出了具体的贡献。第三点将提出例证，来说明苏联数学家根据国际主义精神，怎样无微不至地关心我们，帮助我们。
    先叙述一下已往的事实。旧俄罗斯并不缺乏特出的伟大科学家，但由于沙皇政权的腐败和对科学发展的漠不关心，以致到了十月社会主义革命前夕，俄罗斯科学院全部科学研究人员只有一百五十四人。脱离人民是它的特征。它不和生活相结合，而研究着极其空洞的问题。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命粉碎了并消除了科学和人民之间的壁垒，使科学接近生活，并空前地扩展了科学的活动范围。
    革命胜利之后，苏维埃政权一开始就肯定了科学的重要性。一九一八年列宁亲手写下的有名的“科学技术工作计划草案”，就是苏联共产党领导科学家走向为人民服务的第一个号召。当时，党并委托科学院研究和拟定改组全国工业和复兴经济的计划。但当时科学院并没有能够迅速地去掉理论和实际脱节的现象，以及依据个人兴趣来选择研究题目的传统。一九二九年起，苏联科学院在党的领导下进行了改组。在这次改组过程中，基洛夫起了很大的作用，他使科学院变成了一个巨大的具有统一目的的指导全苏科学研究工作的科学机构。
    在卫国战争中，斯大林给科学院院长柯玛洛夫的两封电报，指出了在卫国战争中，科学院工作的基本方向。由于斯大林伟大的号召，苏联科学家为粉碎敌人的进攻，贡献出自己的全部力量。
    一九四六年，斯大林提出：“我相信，只要我们对我国的学者给以应有的帮助，他们在最近期间，就不仅会赶上，而且会超过国外科学的成绩。”响应斯大林的号召，苏联科学家在执行伟大的第五个五年计划中，特别是斯大林改造大自然计划中，积极从事并且完成了不少极复杂的任务。也在此时肯定了苏联科学的重要特点：综合地解决一切重大的科学任务和国民经济任务。
    在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上，马林科夫号召全苏科学家：“进一步发展先进的苏维埃科学，使它在世界上居第一位。”苏联科学院接受了这一光荣任务。苏联科学院正在进行着一件巨大的工作，即历史地全面地分析和研究世界上所有科学领域的成就，以便选择科学发展的主要方向，和决定关键性的问题。苏联科学工作者全力使科学接近于共产主义建设的实践，接近于工业生产，吸收工业和生产革新者的经验，并在这一基础上来解决巨大的、关键性的理论性的科学问题。
    苏联科学院为什么会在最近三十年来获得飞跃地发展，会从脱离实际的科学研究进入为人民服务的科学研究，会从在世界范围内占比重较小的情况而达到今天的要求占世界首位的情况？无疑的，优越的社会主义制度，和苏联共产党的正确领导是其最主要的原因。以上事实充分地说明了苏联共产党怎样领导着科学家，逐步地由旧的牢笼中走出来，从一个胜利走向一个胜利，一直达到使苏联科学在人类历史上，在世界范畴内的最高峰。这一事实教育了和鼓舞了我们，使我们更深切地认识到唯有依靠党，在党的正确领导下，我们才能走向光明，走向胜利，才能从科学落后的现在走向科学昌明的未来。
    苏联数学科学研究工作的情况，对我并不算生疏。自从一九三五年以来我就为苏联数学的精深所倾倒，特别是苏联数学界的旗帜、社会主义劳动英雄维诺格拉多夫院士的辉煌成就，我十余年来“瞻之在前，倏焉在后”地学习着。我体会到苏联数学有着由具体问题寻求新方法的特质。这一次去苏联使我更扩大了眼界，了解了苏联数学的另一面——博大的一面。我具体地体会到马克思列宁主义在各门科学中所起的作用——即科学间的关联性和整体性。
    拉符抡捷夫院士的声名当然是我所素知的。过去，我只知道他在复变数函数论、泛函分析方面的一些贡献。但是，当我们在苏联访问时，谈到计算数学的时候，我才知道拉符抡捷夫院士不但是数学部门中理论数学的专家、数值计算机构的负责人，而且还是力学专家，他在地震学方面也有极大的贡献。这使我十分惊讶。若干年来在我所接触的资产阶级学者群中，我时常听说：近代的科学分工太细致了，每个科学家仅能研究其中的极小极专的一部门了！受了这种思想影响的我，当然会为拉符抡捷夫的博大而震惊。
    不仅是拉符抡捷夫院士如此，其他如阔勒莫果洛夫院士、索伯列夫院士、彼得罗夫斯基院士等也都是在多方面有贡献的科学家。这使我不得不追根求源地思考一下。为什么在苏联会有这么多的全面发展的人才，而这正是资本主义国家的学者认为在现代科学中所不可能产生的；据我的体会，这完全是由于苏联的科学家具有深厚的马克思列宁主义的思想基础，在这种思想指导之下，苏联的科学家密切地注意了理论和实际配合，教学和研究工作结合的问题。在这种思想指导之下，苏联科学家经常地注意各门科学之间的关联性，因此，在苏联，数学不再成为若干个孤立的山峰，而是科学的有机整体中的一个有机部分。
    当然，我在苏联所体会到的关于马克思列宁主义所给予科学家的帮助的地方还很多，不能一一尽述。但仅仅上面所说的，也就足以使我们中国的科学家认识到学习马克思列宁主义的必要性，只有掌握了马克思列宁主义，我们才不至于走上偏狭的道路，才不至于受不可知论的蒙蔽，才可能克服一切困难而达到苏联科学家的水平。
    毛主席的著作在苏联科学家间发生了重大影响。他们对我们说：如果你们遇到了困难，可以在毛主席的著作中去寻找解决的方法。
    苏联科学家对我们的热爱、关怀，是说不尽的。他们异常诚恳地给我们介绍了他们的先进经验，唯恐我们走一点儿弯路。在苏联，时间是非常宝贵的。但是当我们提出问题时，他们从不吝惜时间，把宝贵的经验详尽地介绍给我们。其中很多不单是对今天中国的科学研究工作有着重大意义，而且是我们终身受用不尽的。
    我现在仅举数学研究所所长维诺格拉多夫为例，来说明苏联科学家对我们的关心。他关心我们的数学发展是无微不至的。他从中学数学教育说起，他关心我们的教科书；他提起中学的数学小组，他更介绍了苏联中等学校八年级至十年级学生的数学竞赛会的情况，并且告诉我们怎样从竞赛会中选拔对数学有特殊培养前途的青年升入大学的数学系，在大学数学系中又必须从培养学生的研究能力的方向入手，一直谈到数学应当如何发展及中国力学如何发展的问题。如果细致地想一下，就会发现他对中国数学事业发展的每一个重要关键都提供了宝贵的意见。
    不仅如此。就是偶然提到的一些例子，维诺格拉多夫也都是谈得非常具体而亲切的。例如，他讲到如何有计划地培养青年学者的时候，他说：“有些青年数学家喜欢研究抽象代数、拓朴和实变数函数论，而不喜欢研究复变数函数论、微分方程论等。但是做数学领导工作的人有责任说服他们，让他们走到和祖国的建设有着实际联系的部门。”
    当谈到数学的发展方向的问题时，他曾经举出这样的一个例子，他说：在一个研究所里，如果只有拓朴学而没有微分方程，很不好；如果只有微分方程而没有拓朴学倒还可以。祖国需要什么，我们就要把什么来做为我们的重点。
    我想他这一段话的意义是说明我们的重点应当是以人民的利益为依归的，同时也说明了微分方程的需要发展比拓朴学更为迫切，而不是说拓朴不重要。至于拓朴学在我国的成绩，那是肯定的。
    维诺格拉多夫院士讲了这段话之后，他又诚恐我们走上了错误的途径，他又补充说：“我们所需要发展的数学是各方面的。因为有些部门在今天并不很重要，但将来是可能有用的。”从这里可以看到维诺格拉多夫院士是怎样地关心着中国数学的发展，是怎样地关心着中国数学能够走上更有效地为人民服务的道路。这使我联想到过去有人谈起的一个故事：在一九四六年，伪中央研究院数学研究所将成立的时候，为了确定数学发展的方向，曾经把中国数学发展的问题，请教过一个美国的“权威”学者。这位“权威”的建议是：“中国数学的发展最好是找一个和旁的科学关系比较少的、容易发展的部门，集中所有力量研究、发展，这样就十分容易地在世界上占有地位。把培养好的青年送到我们普林斯顿高等研究所来深造。你们的研究所可以看作是我们在远东的分所。”根据这个建议，伪中央研究院数学研究所便决定以组合拓朴学为唯一重点，忽视了数学中的其他部门，对于和应用有直接联系的部门更是置之不顾。这个建议阻碍了我国数学科学研究工作的发展。
    对比一下，苏联的数学家总是拿数学研究工作必须和祖国的建设需要相结合为前提来教育我们，希望我们照顾到全面，指示我们必须要有重点地进行工作，而这个重点必须放在祖国需要的部门上；指示我们要扩大眼界，高瞻远瞩，远看到若干年后。他们这样地关心我们，是唯恐我们走了弯路。他们把自己的经验，一一地具体地深入地介绍给我们，他们给予我们一定能够发展科学事业的信心，还教给我们一系列的达到这一目的的工作方法。谁是我们的好朋友是十分明显的。
    从以上几点，我充分地体会到：新中国的科学家应当永远跟着共产党和毛主席，这样，中国的科学才能像苏联的科学一样，从一个胜利走上另一个胜利。我们应当以苏联的科学家作榜样，加强马克思列宁主义的学习，为丰富和全面地发展我国科学事业而努力。我深信：在中国共产党的领导下，在苏联科学家的帮助下，新中国的科学事业是会得到很大的发展的。
