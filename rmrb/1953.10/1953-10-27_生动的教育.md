    Vivid Education
    On September 29th, the Guangxi Daily prominently reported on page two the example of District One of Guanyang County using an exhibition to conduct patriotic education for farmers in preparation for the autumn grain requisition.
    The report stated: District One of Guanyang County held an exhibition at a conference of district and township cadres to arrange the autumn grain requisition preparation work. The exhibition was divided into three sections: the first section was "The Benefits of National Construction for Farmers"; the second section was "How the Communist Party and the People's Government Lead and Help Farmers Increase Production"; and the third section was "How the Volunteers Defend the Motherland so that We Can Produce with Peace of Mind." The exhibition displayed physical objects, pictures, and necessary data and textual explanations, and had dedicated personnel to explain them. In the "Benefits of National Construction for Farmers" section, there were agricultural tools, salt, Shilin cloth clothing, washcloths, rubber shoes, sewing needles, and matches, as well as other means of production and consumer goods. The price of millet was used to compare the prices before liberation in 1948 with the current prices, showing how much the prices had decreased and how much benefit the farmers had received. For example, the exhibition displayed one jin of salt. On the left side of the salt was placed twenty-three jin of millet, which was the price of one jin of salt in 1948. On the right side of the salt was placed three jin and five liang of millet, which is the current price. Now, farmers spend nineteen jin and eleven liang less of millet to buy one jin of salt than before liberation. If a person consumes twelve jin of salt a year, they will save two hundred and thirty-six jin and four liang of millet. The exhibition also displayed a piece of Shilin cloth clothing, which ordinary farmers could not afford before liberation. In the Fuxing Township He Jimin Mutual Aid Team, only one person could afford to wear it in 1949, but by 1952, sixteen people could wear it. This was partly due to farmers' efforts to increase production and earn more money, and partly due to the lower price of cloth. For example, in 1948, it cost at least two hundred jin of millet to make a cotton coat, but now sixty-five jin of millet is enough. The reason why the price of cloth has decreased is because the state has developed the textile industry and textile workers have worked hard to increase production and practice economy. The exhibition also posted photos of state-built textile factories and advanced textile worker Hao Jianxiu implementing new work methods.
    In the "Benefits of National Construction for Farmers" section, there were also three kinds of local products of farmers: one dan of firewood, twenty jin of soybeans, and one pit prop. Before liberation, these local products were not worth much, but today they have a relatively reasonable price. For example, twenty jin of soybeans were worth thirty jin of millet before liberation, but now they are worth forty-five jin of millet. When explaining this section, the person in charge of the explanation grasped the facts that visitors could easily understand, and combined physical object comparisons with charts and numbers to explain in simple terms that due to the recovery and development of the national economy, the leading role of the state-owned economy, the active production of the working class, and the expansion of urban-rural exchanges, the price scissors between agricultural products and industrial products are narrowing, and the lives of farmers have improved. In the future, with the development of national economic construction, the lives of farmers will be even better.
    In the "How the Communist Party and the People's Government Lead and Help Farmers Increase Production" section, various materials on the Party and the government leading farmers to carry out production movements and providing production assistance were displayed. In the area of water conservancy alone, the district built 170 small-scale water conservancy projects such as dikes, dams, and ponds, irrigating a total of 19,483 mu of farmland. As a result of the production movement, farmers throughout the district have harvested more than 2,347,000 jin of grain in the past two years. In the section "How the Volunteers Defend the Motherland so that We Can Produce with Peace of Mind," pictorials related to the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea were displayed, introducing the great achievements of the Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fighting side by side for three years, and pointing out that U.S. imperialism is not resigned to defeat, and that we must raise our vigilance, continue to consolidate national defense, and actively promote national construction.
    According to the Guangxi Daily, the exhibition held in District One of Guanyang County has been very effective. Visitors all believe that it has solved ideological problems and recognized the importance of doing a good job in national construction. Now, this kind of exhibition has been promoted by various townships to the masses. Although the content of the exhibition held in District One of Guanyang County should be further improved based on the feedback from the masses, the way the district adopted a vivid and lively approach, linking the local area with the whole country, linking the individual with the collective, and linking the past, present, and future, to conduct patriotic education for farmers is obviously worth promoting. This is not only a method that can be used in autumn grain requisition propaganda, but also an effective way to conduct regular political education for farmers.

专栏：报纸巡礼

    生动的教育
    广西日报在九月二十九日以二版较显著的地位，报道了灌阳县一区在秋征准备工作中运用展览会向农民进行爱国主义教育的事例。
    报道中说：灌阳县一区在布置秋征准备工作的区乡干部大会上举办了一个展览会。这个展览会共分三栏：第一栏是“国家建设给农民的好处”；第二栏是“共产党和人民政府是怎样领导和扶助农民增加生产的”；第三栏是“志愿军是怎样保卫祖国使我们能安心生产的”。展览会上陈列着实物、图片和必要的数字及文字说明材料，并有专人进行讲解。在“国家建设给农民的好处”栏里就陈列着农具、食盐、士林布衣服、洗脸帕、胶鞋、缝衣针和火柴等生产资料和生活资料；并用谷子作价，拿一九四八年未解放时和现时对比，看价格降低了多少，农民得到了多大的好处。如展览会上摆着一斤食盐，在食盐的左边放着二十三斤谷子，这是一九四八年一斤食盐的价钱；在食盐的右边放着三斤五两谷子，这是现时的价钱。现在农民买一斤盐比解放前少花十九斤十一两谷子；如果一个人一年吃十二斤盐，就要节省二百三十六斤四两谷子。展览会上又摆着士林布衣服一件，这是解放前一般农民穿不上的。该区福兴乡何吉民互助组一九四九年时才有一个人能穿上，到一九五二年就已经有十六人穿了。这一方面固然由于农民努力增产，有了钱，另一方面则是因为布价便宜了的缘故。如一九四八年做件棉衣服至少要二百斤谷子，现在有六十五斤多谷子就足够了。布价所以降低，就是国家发展了纺织工业和纺织工人努力增产节约。展览会并贴出了国家建设纺织工厂和先进纺织工人郝建秀进行新工作法的照片。
    在“国家建设给农民的好处”这一栏里，还陈列了三种农民的土产：一担柴火，二十斤黄豆，一根坑木。解放前这些土产很不值钱，而今天却有了比较合理的价格。如黄豆二十斤解放前值谷三十斤，现在值谷四十五斤。负责讲解的人在讲解这一栏时，抓住了参观者容易理解的事实，将实物对比和图表数字配合起来，通俗地说明了由于国民经济的恢复和发展，国营经济的领导作用，工人阶级的积极生产，城乡交流的扩大等原因，农产品和工业品的剪刀差额日益缩小，农民的生活得到了改善；今后随着国家经济建设的开展，农民的日子会过得更好。
    在“共产党和人民政府是怎样领导和扶助农民增加生产的”一栏里，则陈列了党和政府领导农民开展生产运动和进行生产扶助的各项材料。光兴修水利一项，该区就修了堤、坝、塘等小型水利一百七十处，共灌溉田亩一万九千四百八十三亩。生产运动开展的结果，使得全区农民近两年来多收粮食二百三十四万七千余斤。在“志愿军是怎样保卫祖国使我们能安心生产的”一栏内，集中展览了有关抗美援朝的画刊，一方面介绍了志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战三年来所取得的伟大成就，另一方面指明了美帝国主义并不死心，我们要提高警惕，继续巩固国防，积极推进国家建设事业。
    据广西日报报道，灌阳县一区所举办的这个展览会收效很好，参观者都认为很解决思想问题，认识了搞好国家建设的重要性。现在这种展览会已由各乡推行到群众去了。灌阳县一区所举办的展览会的内容虽然还应根据群众反映继续改进，但像该区这样采用生动活泼的方式，将本地区和全国联系起来，将个人和集体联系起来，将过去、现在和将来联系起来，向农民进行爱国主义教育，显然是值得提倡的。这不仅是秋征宣传中可以采用的一种方式，也是向农民经常进行政治教育的一种有效方式。
