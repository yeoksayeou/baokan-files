Shaanxi farmers are selling grain after a bumper harvest to repay national agricultural loans. According to statistics from the Shaanxi Branch of the People's Bank of China, as of the end of September, the total amount of agricultural loans repaid by farmers in the province has reached 56% of the total amount of loans due and overdue. Among them, farmers in counties such as Nanzheng, Fengxian, and Ningqiang have fully repaid all kinds of agricultural loans. Farmers in the Baoji area, whose main crop is summer harvest, have repaid 88% of their loans.

Shaanxi Province saw the largest number of agricultural loans in the first and second quarters before spring plowing and summer harvest. During this period, the loan recipients included not only more than 80,000 agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations, but also more than 200,000 individual farmers. As of the end of September, thanks to national loans, farmers across the province purchased more than 26 million jin of various fertilizers, nearly 2 million jin of cotton, corn, and other seeds, more than 6,500 waterwheels, as well as many livestock, medicines, machinery, and farm tools. This year, Shaanxi farmers have reaped a bumper harvest, and national loans have played a certain role.

After the bumper harvest, farmers, with grateful hearts, sell grain and cotton to the state to repay their loans. From early July to the end of September, farmers in Liquan County used the money from selling wheat to not only repay the third quarter's due and overdue national loans, but also repaid the fourth quarter's loans in advance. In Xingping County, farmers in three districts sold more than 400,000 jin of wheat in one month from mid-July to early August, repaying more than 95% of their due loans. In order to facilitate farmers' repayment of loans, People's Banks in various places have generally adopted the method of rotating shifts and accepting repayments as they arrive. Xianyang, Xingping, Liquan, Fengxiang and other counties have also organized mobile teams to go deep into the countryside to handle the procedures for farmers to repay their loans.

    陕西农民出售粮食归还国家农业贷款
    陕西省农民在丰收后出卖粮食，归还国家农业贷款。据中国人民银行陕西省分行统计，截至九月底止，全省农民归还农业贷款的总数已达到期和逾期贷款总数的百分之五十六，其中南郑、凤县、宁强等县农民已全部还清了各种农业贷款，以夏收作物为主的宝鸡专区的农民已归还贷款百分之八十八。
    陕西省在春耕生产和夏收以前的第一、二两个季度农业贷款数字最大，在这个时期内，贷款对象不仅有八万多个农业生产互助合作组织，而且有二十多万户单干农民。截至九月底止，全省农民由于得到国家贷款，买到各种肥料达两千六百多万斤，棉花、玉米等种籽近二百万斤，水车六千五百多辆以及很多牲畜、药械和农具等。今年陕西农民获得丰收，国家贷款起了一定的作用。
    农民丰收以后，怀着感激的心情把粮食和棉花卖给国家以归还贷款。醴泉县各地农民由七月初到九月底止，用出售小麦的钱不仅归还了第三季度的到期和逾期的国家贷款，而且提前归还了第四季度的贷款。兴平县的三个区的农民在七月中旬到八月上旬一个月内，卖出小麦四十多万斤，归还到期贷款百分之九十五以上。各地人民银行为了便利农民归还贷款，普遍采用轮流值班，随到随收的办法。咸阳、兴平、醴泉、凤翔等县还组织巡回小组深入农村办理农民归还贷款的手续。
