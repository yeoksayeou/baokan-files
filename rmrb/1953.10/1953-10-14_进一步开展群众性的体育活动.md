    Further Develop Mass Sports Activities
    Cheng Zhi
    Under the correct leadership and loving care of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the sports movement in New China has made great achievements in the past four years. This achievement was concentrated and prominently demonstrated at the "1953 National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Championships" held in the capital in early October. In the thirty-four track and field events of the Games, nineteen set new national records; the women's achievements were even more remarkable, with all but the high jump, long jump, discus throw in the field events, and the newly added 1,000-meter medley relay in the track events surpassing the national record level. Many people who have been engaged in sports work for many years also believe that such outstanding achievements are rare in the sports history of the world.

    The rapid advancement of sports technology is inseparable from the correct sports policy. Chairman Mao's instruction to "develop sports and improve the people's physique" is our sports policy. This policy requires the development of mass sports activities to serve the people's health, economic construction, and national defense construction.

    In the past four years, with the restoration and development of national industrial and agricultural production, mass sports activities and sports competitions have been widely carried out in schools and troops, and are gradually being carried out in factories, government agencies, and some rural areas. In the Northeast Region, from the complete liberation of the entire region at the end of 1948 to August of this year, a total of nine regional sports meets were held, and 163 sports meets and selection competitions were held successively in the six provinces and six cities of the region. The number of participants in the sports meets has increased year by year, and the proportion of workers and peasants and female athletes has increased particularly significantly. For example, more than 40% of the athletes participating in the 4th Sports Meet of Liaoxi Province came from factories and rural areas. In August of this year, at the "Northeast Region Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Championships" held in Dalian, nearly 40% of the athletes from the Heilongjiang Province delegation were women. Sports in Xinjiang Province was not very popular in the past, but in mid-July of this year, the first sports meet was also held in Dihua City. More than 100,000 people visited the sports meet, many of whom came from the remote national border.

    These situations show that our sports movement has a preliminary mass base.

    In some factories and government agencies, the number of employees and cadres who persist in sports activities is gradually increasing. In Shanghai, where workers are more concentrated, according to a survey of 338,558 employees from 705 primary trade unions, 72,737 people regularly participate in sports activities; in the No. 6 workshop of the Northeast Machinery Factory No. 3, the workers not only persisted in doing broadcast exercises every day, but also promoted four-section exercises suitable for their own work.

    The composition of the 658 outstanding athletes who participated in this National Games specifically demonstrates the fruitful achievements of developing mass sports, and demonstrates the brilliant achievements of the working class and peasants after they have gained the opportunity to exercise and mastered sports skills. Liu Chengbang, one of the winners of the first place in the men's individual all-around score, is a railway weigher. He has not participated in formal sports training for a long time, but he won first place in javelin throwing and grenade throwing, and also broke the national record in grenade throwing. Yi Taotege, a Mongolian youth and soldier of the People's Liberation Army from a pastoral background, achieved a score of 15 minutes and 48 seconds in the 5,000-meter final, also breaking the national record. The Northeast delegation, which won the second place in the team all-around score, emphasized the mass nature of sports activities in the Northeast region when analyzing the basic reasons for their victory at a meeting. The fact is that sports technology can only be improved on the basis of popularization. Liu Yuying, a female athlete from the Northeast region who won the first place in the women's individual all-around score and broke the national records in both the 100-meter and 200-meter events, is an 18-year-old student at the Dalian Normal School. She grew up and was cultivated in the development of mass sports activities.

    Due to the extremely clear political purpose of our sports movement, the moral character of athletes has also undergone fundamental changes. The qualities of being brave, tenacious, not arrogant, not discouraged, obeying the organization, and abiding by discipline, as well as the style of competing for progress, unity, and progress, have become the common characteristics of athletes. This National Games fully demonstrated this new atmosphere. Athletes from different regions and different ethnic groups encouraged each other to create higher new records for the motherland. When Luo Yunqi, a female athlete from the People's Liberation Army, broke the national record of shot put held by Wang Canhua from East China with a score of 12 meters and 19 centimeters, Wang Canhua cordially shook hands with her and congratulated her on creating an excellent sports record for the motherland.

    But the brilliant achievements of this National Games are only a good start. The development of sports is still far behind the needs of various construction undertakings of the motherland. At present, we have entered a new historical period of implementing planned economic construction and gradually transitioning to a socialist society. Exercising to improve health, so that the people of the whole country, especially the younger generation, can exert greater strength in the glorious cause of defending peace and building the motherland, has become a major and lofty task of the sports movement. In the four years since liberation, we have relied on our own efforts and on the advanced ideas and advanced experience of Soviet sports to achieve great achievements. In the future, we should, on the existing basis, more widely develop mass sports activities, which is the central link in the development of China's sports movement.

    The development of mass sports activities has gained a lot of experience in the troops, railway system, and various regions. By organizing large and small sports meets, diversified competitions, and sending sports work teams to various places to conduct touring performances, many people have been attracted to the ranks of sports activities. The touring performances of the North China Men's and Women's Basketball and Volleyball teams in five cities along the Beijing-Baotou Railway (Beijing to Suiyuan Baotou) in May this year alone attracted 95,000 spectators. The Northeast Railway system has organized 10,045 large and small sports meets and competitions in the past three years, and the number of various sports training groups has increased to 6,002. These effective methods have gradually strengthened the athlete teams of the railway system.

    But our country's planned economic construction has just begun, and there are still many difficult and complicated tasks facing the people of the whole country. In addition, the foundation of the national sports movement was originally relatively weak, and the development was also very uneven. Therefore, the development of mass sports activities must proceed from reality and advance steadily, and must not be eager for quick results. The tendency of rushing and over-exercising that has occurred in a few areas must be overcome. Because being too hasty will affect the development of mass sports.

    Some regions and units have organized and promoted simple and easy-to-implement sports activities according to actual conditions, and have absorbed many people who were unwilling to participate in sports activities in the past into the ranks of sports. The reason why sports in Putian County, Fujian Province, East China, is active is because it has mastered this method: finding active members from various sports and establishing various amateur organizations for physical exercise through them. In this way, the scope of sports has gradually expanded from several middle schools to the masses of the people.

    Our great motherland has created all the conditions to cultivate a healthy, happy, and lively younger generation. Party organizations, people's governments, and youth league and trade union organizations at all levels should follow Chairman Mao's instructions to develop our sports movement more widely, and improve sports technology in a planned and step-by-step manner on the basis of popularization, so that our sports technology will gradually reach the world's advanced level.

    进一步开展群众性的体育活动
    程执
    新中国的体育运动事业，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导与亲切关怀下，四年来已获得很大成就。这种成就，集中、突出地从十月初在首都举行的“一九五三年全国田径、体操、自行车运动大会”上表现出来。运动会的三十四项田径赛项目，有十九项创造了全国最高纪录；女子成绩更为卓越，十三项竞赛项目除田赛的跳高、跳远、掷铁饼和径赛的新添项目一千公尺异程接力外，其余全部超过全国纪录水平。许多从事多年体育工作的人，也认为这种优异的成就，在世界各国的体育运动史册上都是不多见的。
    运动技术的突飞猛进，是和正确的体育运动方针分不开的。毛主席指示我们的“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”，就是我们的体育运动的方针。这个方针要求开展群众性的体育运动，为人民的健康、经济建设和国防建设服务。
    四年来，随着国家工农业生产的恢复和发展，群众性的体育活动和运动竞赛，已经在学校和部队里广泛展开，工厂、机关和部分农村，也正逐步开展。东北区自一九四八年底全境解放到今年八月，全区性的运动大会共举行了九次，全区六省六市先后举行了一百六十三次运动会和选拔比赛会。参加运动会的人数一年比一年增加，而工农成分和女运动员比重的增长尤为显著。如参加辽西省第四届运动大会的运动员，百分之四十以上来自工厂和农村。今年八月，在大连举行的“东北区田径、体操、自行车运动大会”，黑龙江省代表队的选手，近百分之四十是妇女。新疆省的体育运动过去不很普及，今年七月中旬，也在迪化市举行了首届体育运动会。参观这次运动会的达十万多人，其中不少是从辽远的国境线上赶来的。
    这些情况表明：我们的体育运动事业，已经具有了初步的群众基础。
    而在部分工厂和机关，坚持体育活动的职工和干部，正逐渐增多。工人比较集中的上海市，根据七百零五个基层工会三十三万八千五百五十八名职工的调查，经常参加体育活动的有七万二千七百三十七人；东北机械三厂六车间，工人们不仅坚持了每天作广播体操，而且还推行了适合于他们自己工作的四节体操。
    参加这次全国运动会的六百五十八名优秀选手的成分，具体地显示了开展群众体育运动的丰硕收获，显示了工农群众在得到了运动锻炼的机会和掌握了运动技巧后的光辉成就。荣获大会男子个人总分第一的优胜者之一的刘成邦，就是铁路司磅员。他参加正规的体育锻炼的时间并不很长，但掷标枪和掷手榴弹都取得了第一名，掷手榴弹还打破了全国最高纪录。牧民出身的蒙族青年、人民解放军战士伊套特格，五千公尺决赛成绩达到十五分四十八秒，也打破了全国最高纪录。获得大会团体总分第二的东北代表队，在一次会议上分析他们取得胜利的几个基本原因时，特别强调了东北区体育活动的群众性。事实也正是这样，体育运动只有在普及的基础上，运动技术才有可能提高。女子个人总分第一、百公尺和二百公尺都打破了全国纪录的东北区选手刘玉英，是旅大师范学校一个年仅十八岁的学生，她就是在开展群众性的体育运动中生长、培养起来的。
    由于我们的体育运动的极其明确的政治目的，运动员的道德作风也有了根本的变化。勇敢顽强、不骄不馁、服从组织、遵守纪律的品质和竞相进取、团结进步的作风，已成为运动员的共同特点。这次运动大会充分展示出了这种新的气象。来自不同地区、不同民族的选手，彼此勉励着为祖国创造更高的新纪录。当解放军女子选手罗运琪，以十二公尺十九公分的成绩，打破华东区选手王灿华所保持的推铅球全国最高纪录时，王灿华亲切地和她握手，祝贺她为祖国创造了优异的运动纪录。
    但这次运动大会的光辉成就，还仅仅是良好的开端。体育运动事业的发展，今天还远远地落后于祖国各种建设事业的需要。目前，我们已进入实施有计划的经济建设、逐步过渡到社会主义社会的新的历史时期。锻炼身体、提高健康水平，使全国人民、特别是年青一代在保卫和平和建设祖国的光荣事业中，发挥更大的力量，就成为体育运动事业的重大而崇高的任务。在解放后的四年中，我们已经依靠自己的努力，依靠苏联体育运动的先进思想和先进经验，取得了巨大成绩，今后我们应该在现有基础上，更加广泛地开展群众性的体育活动，这就是发展我国体育运动事业的中心一环。
    群众性体育活动的开展，在部队、铁路系统和各地区，都已取得不少经验。通过组织大小型运动会，多样化的对抗赛和派遣体育工作队到各地进行巡回表演，许多群众已被吸引到体育活动的队伍中来。仅华北区男、女篮排球代表队今年五月在京包线（北京至绥远包头）五个城市的巡回表演，观众即达九万五千人。东北铁路系统三年来共组织了大小型运动会和对抗赛达一万零四十五次，各种体育锻炼小组，已增加到六千零二个。这些有效的方法，使铁路系统的运动员队伍，逐渐地壮大起来。
    但我们祖国有计划的经济建设还刚刚开始，摆在全国人民面前的，还有许多艰难而复杂的工作，再加上全国体育运动的基础原来就比较薄弱，发展也很不平衡，因此开展群众性的体育运动，必须从实际出发，稳步前进，决不能急于求成。少数地区发生突击和锻炼过度的偏向，必须加以克服。因为求之过急，反而会影响群众性运动的开展。
    有些地区和单位根据实际条件，组织和推行了简单易行的体育活动，吸收了许多过去不愿参加体育活动的人，参加了体育运动的队伍。华东区福建省莆田县体育运动之所以活跃，就是由于掌握了这一方法；从各项运动中发现积极分子，通过他们建立锻炼身体的各种业余组织。这样，体育运动的范围，就从几个中等学校逐渐扩展到人民群众中去。
    我们伟大的祖国，已经创建了一切条件去培养健康的、愉快活泼的年青一代，各级党的组织、人民政府以及青年团和职工会组织，应该遵循毛主席的指示，把我们的体育运动事业，更广泛地开展起来，在普及的基础上，有计划、有步骤地提高运动技术，使我们的运动技术逐步地达到世界先进水平。
