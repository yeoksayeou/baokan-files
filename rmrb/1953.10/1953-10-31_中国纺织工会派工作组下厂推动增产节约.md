    The National Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union, in order to better promote the development of the increased production and thrift campaign in textile factories across the country, strengthen concrete leadership, and establish a normal order for union work, dispatched work teams to Shanghai, Qingdao, the Southwest and other places in mid-September and early October to assist in the work. The work team sent to Qingdao, in addition to investigating the issues of how to proceed with increased production and thrift in the state-owned Qingdao No. 1, 2, 4, and 8 cotton textile factories, also summarized the experience of the state-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory in technical management together with relevant parties. It also helped the factory's union study how to establish a normal order for union work in the increased production and thrift campaign. Due to the strengthening of the union's work, the progress of the increased production and thrift campaign has been promoted.
    The work teams sent to Shanghai, the Southwest and other places will also study the issue of strengthening union work and gradually establishing a normal order for union work while helping to carry out the increased production and thrift campaign.
    The work team studying the work of unions in private factories, in addition to investigating the production situation and union work of Tianjin Hengyuan Yarn Factory, Qingdao Huaxin Yarn Factory, and Jinan Chengtong Yarn Factory, has now arrived in Shanghai and will study the union work in private factories in Shanghai.

    中国纺织工会派工作组下厂推动增产节约
    中国纺织工会全国委员会为了更好地推动各地纺织工厂增产节约竞赛的开展，加强具体领导，并从中建立工会工作的正常秩序，于九月中，十月初，先后派了工作组分赴上海、青岛、西南等地帮助进行工作。去青岛的工作组除调查了国营青岛第一、二、四、八等棉纺织厂增产节约从何着手等问题外，并会同有关方面总结了国营青岛第六棉纺织厂在技术管理方面的经验。还帮助该厂工会，研究了在增产节约竞赛中，如何建立工会工作的正常秩序问题。该厂由于工会工作的加强，推动了增产节约竞赛的进展。
    到上海、西南等地去的工作组，也将在帮助开展增产节约竞赛的同时，研究加强工会工作，逐步建立工会工作正常秩序的问题。
    研究私营厂工会工作的工作组，除调查了天津恒源纱厂、青岛华新纱厂、济南成通纱厂等的生产情况和工会工作外，现在这个工作组已到达了上海，将在上海研究私营工厂的工会工作。
