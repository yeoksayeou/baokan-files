    Modern Power Plant Built with Soviet Assistance
    Xi'an No. 2 Power Plant Begins Generating Electricity
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The first modern automated thermal power plant in the Northwest, the state-owned Xi'an No. 2 Power Plant, has been completed and is operating well in trial runs. A ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the completion and commissioning of the new plant was held on October 9th. When all existing equipment at this power plant is fully operational, its generating capacity will be twice that of Xi'an No. 1 Power Plant.
    The ceremony was attended by Ma Wenrui, Deputy Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Administrative Committee, Cheng Mingsheng, Director of the Electric Power Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, representatives from various organizations and groups in the Northwest Region and Xi'an City, and more than 2,000 employees. Also attending the conference were Mr. Prapkin, head of the Soviet expert group invited to help our country in its construction, and Mr. Borunov, head of the Soviet installation expert group and construction expert Mr. Shapiro, who guided the construction of this power plant, and 16 other people.
    Ma Wenrui, Deputy Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, spoke at the celebration ceremony. He first pointed out the great significance of the completion of this power plant. He said that the power industry is the foundation for the development of all industries. The completion of this power plant can not only fully supply the electricity needs of industrial production and urban people's lives in the Xi'an and Xianyang areas for the next two or three years, but more importantly, this power plant was successfully built in the Northwest region, where the industrial base is relatively weak, in the first year of our country's planned economic construction. It provides us with rich construction experience and cultivates a group of construction talents who can master new technologies. This is very valuable for our future construction undertakings. He pointed out that the completion of this power plant is inseparable from the selfless assistance of Soviet experts. He called on all employees to continuously learn from Soviet advanced experience and improve their technology in order to do a good job in our construction undertakings. Mr. Borunov, head of the Soviet expert group, Cheng Mingsheng, Director of the Electric Power Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, and worker representative Lei Dingkun also spoke at the meeting. After the speeches, the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Northwest Administrative Committee, and the Northwest Finance and Economics Committee presented flags to Soviet experts Prapkin, Borunov, Shapiro, and others to express their gratitude, and awarded banners and prizes to the four construction units, fourteen advanced groups, and labor models that participated in the construction of this power plant.
    The Xi'an No. 2 Power Plant was designed by Soviet experts and equipped with the most advanced Soviet technology and the latest machinery. The degree of mechanization and automation is first-class in our country. From the moment the train delivers coal to the factory, crushes it, grinds it into powder, and sends it to the boiler for combustion, all processes are automatically operated by machines. Many important components are equipped with duplicate equipment; if one set fails, the other set will automatically take its place to ensure that power generation is not interrupted. The boiler, turbine, and main switchboard are all equipped with automatic signals. If something goes wrong, the duty personnel will know immediately and can carry out pre-emptive repairs. All parts of the machinery and equipment also have an "interlock device." If the worker operates incorrectly, the machine will automatically stop to protect personal safety and prevent damage to the machinery and equipment. In the main control room, there is a Soviet-style 20-line dispatch telephone. The factory director can talk to the operators in each workshop at any time and can transmit orders to each workshop at the same time. In addition, there are good security facilities throughout the plant and a strict fire-fighting organization. In the event of a fire or other accident, the security department can be notified directly at any time. Due to the superiority of the equipment, the number of production personnel is reduced, coal consumption is low, and operation is economical and safe, and production costs can be greatly reduced.
    Construction of the Xi'an No. 2 Power Plant began last November, and it went through a severe winter and a hot summer. In the course of construction, construction workers and installation workers showed high levels of labor enthusiasm and overcame various difficulties to complete the various projects on schedule. The quality of the project was guaranteed thanks to the Soviet experts' personal on-site guidance and the whole-hearted study of Soviet advanced construction experience by all employees, as well as their earnest implementation of the Soviet experts' recommendations. During the construction process, in order to strictly supervise the phenomenon of not paying attention to quality in construction, the construction unit also specially organized a supervisory team to go to and from work with the workers, conduct inspections at any time, and promptly check and accept hidden works, avoiding major rework and waste. At the same time, thanks to a tight security organization during construction, no fatal accidents occurred even when working at a height of sixty meters. During the construction period, this power plant received support from an installation team of more than 600 people from the Northeast Thermal Power Engineering Company, and more than 30 units from all over the country and the Northwest region helped it solve problems in manpower, technology, fuel, and materials.
    From zero o'clock on September 25th, the machinery and equipment of this power plant entered a complete set of start-up, and the operation is in good condition. The turbine vibration amplitude is only 0.02 mm (the design requirement is 0.07%), and the boiler has never had a fire-out accident since it was ignited more than 20 days ago.

    苏联帮助我国建设的现代化发电厂
    西安第二发电厂开始发电
    【本报讯】西北第一座现代化自动火力发电厂——国营西安第二发电厂已经建成，试车情况良好。十月九日举行了庆祝新厂落成发电剪彩典礼。这座发电厂的现有设备全部开动后，发电容量等于西安第一发电厂发电容量的两倍。
    参加典礼的有中共中央西北局副书记马文瑞、西北行政委员会副主席杨明轩、中央人民政府燃料工业部电业管理总局局长程明升和西北区、西安市各机关团体的代表以及职工共两千多人。参加大会的还有应邀前来帮助我国建设的苏联专家总组长普拉普金和指导这座发电厂修建工程的苏联安装专家组长鲍鲁诺夫、建筑专家沙比罗等十六人。
    庆祝典礼上，中共中央西北局副书记马文瑞讲话。他首先指出这座发电厂的建成的重大意义。他说，电力工业是发展一切工业的基础，这座发电厂的建成，不仅可以充分供给西安和咸阳地区今后两三年内工业生产和城市人民生活用电的需要；更重要的是，这座发电厂是在我国开始有计划的经济建设的第一年、在工业基础比较薄弱的西北地区顺利建设起来的，它给我们提供了丰富的建设经验，培养了一批能够掌握新技术的建设人材。这对我们今后的建设事业是非常宝贵的。他指出这座发电厂的建成是与苏联专家的无私援助分不开的。他号召全体职工不断地学习苏联先进经验和提高自己的技术，为作好我们的建设事业而努力。在会上讲话的还有苏联专家组长鲍鲁诺夫、中央人民政府燃料工业部电业管理总局局长程明升和工人代表雷定坤。讲话完毕后，中共中央西北局、西北行政委员会和西北财政经济委员会等单位向苏联专家普拉普金、鲍鲁诺夫、沙比罗等赠旗致谢，并给参加这座发电厂建设的四个施工单位、十四个先进小组和劳动模范颁发锦旗和奖品。
    西安第二发电厂是由苏联专家设计，并用苏联最先进的技术和最新式的机器装备起来的，机械化和自动化的程度在我国都是第一流的。从火车把煤送到厂房，打碎、磨成粉，送入锅炉燃烧，一直到强大的电力发出为止，全部过程都是机器自动来操作。很多重要的机件，都装置了双套设备，这套出了故障，另一套就自动来代替，保证发电不致中断。锅炉、透平和总配电盘都设有自动信号，哪里出了毛病，值班人员立刻就会知道，可以进行事先检修。各部分机器设备还有一套“联锁装置”，如果工人操作错误，机器就自动停止，以保护人身安全和机器设备不致损坏。在主控制室内，装有苏联最新式的二十门调度电话，厂长随时可与各车间操作人员通话，并能在同一时间内把命令传达到各个车间。另外，全厂各处都有很好的保安设备和一套严密的消防组织，一旦发生失火或其他事故，能随时直接通知保安部门。由于设备的优越性，生产人员减少，煤耗低，运转时经济而安全，生产成本可以大大降低。
    西安第二发电厂从去年十一月开工，中间经过了一个严寒的冬季和炎热的夏季。在施工过程中，建筑工人和安装工人发挥了高度的劳动热情，克服了各种困难，使各项工程按期完成。由于苏联专家亲到现场指导和全体职工虚心学习了苏联先进的施工经验，并认真执行了苏联专家的建议，保证了工程质量。在工程进行中，为了严格监督施工中不注意质量的现象，建设单位还特别组织了监工小组，和工人一同上、下班，随时进行检查，并及时验收隐蔽工程，避免了重大的返工浪费现象。同时在施工中由于有了严密的保安组织，虽在六十公尺的高空作业中，从未发生死亡事故。在建设期间，这座发电厂得到了东北火电工程公司六百多人组成的安装大队的支援，全国各地和西北地区还有三十多个单位帮助它解决了人力、技术、燃料和器材等方面的问题。
    九月二十五日零时起，这座发电厂机器设备就进入整套起动，运转情况良好。透平机振动幅度只到百分之二公厘（设计要求是百分之七）；锅炉自点火二十多天以来，从来没有发生停火事故。
