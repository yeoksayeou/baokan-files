Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 3rd. In response to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's announcement to prisoners of war on September 26, Hamblen, the head of the U.S. Repatriation Group, sent a letter to Lieutenant General Thimayya of India, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, absurdly lodging a protest. Chairman Thimayya sent a reply to Hamblen on the 2nd. The full text of the reply is as follows:

"Dear General Hamblen,

I have received your letter No. AG 383.6/2RGCG issued on September 28. Before I reply to the points raised in your letter, I think I should let you know certain facts so that you may arrive at a different conclusion than the one you reached in your letter.

Undoubtedly, you are certainly aware of the provisions of Clause 22 of the Terms of Reference, which require that all non-directly repatriated prisoners of war must be informed of the various provisions contained therein. The Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command has given assurances that this has been done. However, it soon became known that the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, in doing so, had given an interpretation of the Terms of Reference that this Commission could not accept. In his letter to me on September 12, Lieutenant General Harrison stated that the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command had informed the prisoners of war that there would be no observing representatives from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army present when the Indian Custodial Forces began to guard them. As you know, this interpretation of Clause 1 of the Terms of Reference to the prisoners of war is contrary to the unanimous opinion of this Commission, which unanimously believes that the taking over of the custodial work of the prisoners of war is a 'Commission task,' and that observing representatives from both sides have the right to attend. The Commission cannot accept any guidance other than its own interpretation. Clause 24 of the Terms of Reference stipulates that the interpretation of the Terms of Reference is a matter for the Commission. Therefore, the unfortunate difference of opinion between the Commission and the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command must be rectified.

After the prisoners of war began to be transferred to the Commission, it became even more apparent that the prisoners of war's understanding of the Terms of Reference was insufficient. On several issues, it appeared that they had also received incorrect information from a certain party. The prisoners of war brought with them a large number of leaflets, brochures, and other printed materials. I would like to give you just one example: leaflets were found in the hands of the prisoners of war, with a picture of the Indian flag printed on one side. On the other side, however, was printed a short essay discussing India's foreign and domestic policies. No matter how complimentary this essay may be to India's policies and purposes, it cannot be said to be for the purpose of explaining the Terms of Reference, nor can it be said to be for the purpose of explaining the duties and responsibilities of India as stipulated in the Terms of Reference.

The prisoners of war also have the impression that they will be released after ninety days, whereas you know that the Terms of Reference stipulate a period of one hundred and twenty days. And they have been told that they will go to Taiwan at the end of this period, whereas according to the Terms of Reference, they have the right to go to any neutral country.

All of this has created misunderstandings in the minds of the prisoners of war and added difficulties for this Commission, so this Commission believes that it has an inescapable responsibility to explain the Terms of Reference to the prisoners of war again. Therefore, a subcommittee was established to draft a letter to the prisoners of war. The subcommittee's draft was discussed by this Commission, and the final draft was unanimously adopted by this Commission.

The original draft was written in English, and the Chinese translation was completed by the Czechoslovak, Polish, Swedish, Swiss, and Indian personnel of this Commission. The Korean translation was completed by the Czechoslovak, Polish, Swedish, and Swiss personnel of this Commission. Both translations were unanimously adopted.

A copy of the English original is attached. This Commission believes that this original draft is a completely correct interpretation of the Terms of Reference. Furthermore, the Chinese and Korean translations are no less faithful to the English original than any translation that can be considered faithful.

I do not understand your reference to interpreters. This Commission did not engage in translation work. This Commission only reviewed and approved the translations. Since this Commission is not lacking in personnel who are proficient in the respective languages, there has never been a need for interpreters.

This Commission has considered the suggestion in the last section of your letter. If such an incident occurs again in the future, this Commission will pay attention to it when it deems it necessary or appropriate.

There is one more thing that I think I should bring to your attention on behalf of this Commission. It appears that your letter to me was published by you to the press before I received it. I have seen this happen several times. Obviously, you think this is the right approach. This Commission believes (and I am sure you will not take offense at this statement) that this approach is not helpful for the calm consideration of any issue. I even think it hinders and obstructs the progress of this Commission's work. This Commission attaches great importance to the press. But it believes that the press is entitled to more than just unilaterally published opinions.

I believe you are very much hoping to cooperate with this Commission and are willing to help it fulfill its mission and significant responsibilities. However, since you have published your letter to the press, I will publish this letter after you receive it. Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission."

    答复美方就告战俘书所提出的荒谬抗议
    中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅复函汉布伦
    【新华社开城三日电】在中立国遣返委员会于九月二十六日向战俘发表公告信后，美方遣返组组长汉布伦曾致函中立国遣返委员会主席印度蒂迈雅中将，荒谬地提出抗议。蒂迈雅中将在二日以复信送致汉布伦。复信全文如下：
    “亲爱的汉布伦将军：
    我已接到你于九月二十八日发出的AG三八三·六／二RGCG号来信。在我答复你信中所提出各点之前，我觉得应该使你知道某些事实，这样你便会获得与上述你信中所获得的不同的结论。
    没有疑问，你当然知道职权范围第二十二款的规定，该款中各项规定必须让不直接遣返的战俘知道。联军司令部已经提供保证，说这一点已经做到。但是，不久大家就知道，联军司令部在这样做的时候，却对职权范围作了一种本委员会所不能接受的解释。哈利逊中将在九月十二日给我的信中说，联军司令部已告知战俘，在印度看守部队开始看管他们时，将没有朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部的观察代表在场。你知道，对战俘作这种关于职权范围第一款的解释，是违反本委员会的一致意见的，本委员会一致认为，接管战俘的看管工作是一项‘委员会的工作’，双方的观察代表有权出席。委员会除了它自己的解释以外，不能接受任何解释的指导。职权范围第二十四款规定，职权范围的解释是委员会的事。因此，委员会与联军司令部之间的不幸的意见分歧必须加以纠正。
    在战俘开始移交给委员会后，可以更明显地看出，战俘对于职权范围的了解是不足的。在若干问题上，看来他们从某一有关方面所获得的消息也是错误的。战俘随身带来了大批传单、小册子以及其他印刷品。我愿意只向你举出一个例子：在战俘手中发现传单，在一面，印着一幅印度旗。在另一面，却印有一篇短文，论述印度的外交和内政政策。不论这篇短文对印度的政策和宗旨可能作怎样的恭维论述，绝不能说这是为了要解释职权范围，也不能说这是为了要解释职权范围所规定的印度的职务和责任。
    战俘并怀有这种印象，认为他们将在九十天后获释，而你知道，职权范围规定一百二十天的期限。并且有人告诉他们，他们在这个期限终了时将到台湾去，而依照职权范围，他们有权到任何中立国去。
    所有这一切，都在战俘心中造成误解，为本委员会增加了困难，因此本委员会认为，它有不可逃避的责任向战俘再度说明职权范围。因此，成立了一个小组委员会草拟一份告战俘书。小组委员会的草稿经过本委员会的讨论，最后定稿亦经本委员会一致通过。
    原稿系用英文草成，中文翻译工作是由本委员会捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、瑞典、瑞士及印度人员完成的。朝鲜文翻译工作是由本委员会捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、瑞典及瑞士人员完成的。两种译文都经一致通过。
    兹附上英文原稿一份。本委员会认为，这份原稿对职权范围的解释是完全正确的。此外，中文与朝鲜文译稿之忠于英文原稿，不下于任何可以认为是忠实的译文。
    我不懂你提到译员的话。本委员会并未从事翻译工作。本委员会只审阅译文并加以通过。由于本委员会不乏通晓各该语文的人员，因此从来没有需要译员的问题。
    本委员会已对你信最后一节中的建议加以考虑。将来如再有这类事件，本委员会在认为必要或认为相宜时，自当予以注意。
    还有一件事，我认为我应该代表本委员会引起你的注意。看来你给我的信在我收到之前已由你向报界公布。这样的事我已看到几次了。显然，你认为这是正确的办法。本委员会认为（并且我敢肯定你不会对我这种说法引以为意），这种办法对冷静地考虑任何问题，是没有帮助的。我甚至认为，它会妨碍和阻挠本委员会工作的进行。本委员会非常重视报界。但是它认为，报界有权得到比单方面发表的任何意见要多的东西。
    我相信你是非常希望和本委员会合作，并愿意帮助它履行它的任务和重大的责任的。但是，由于你已向报界发表了你的信，我将在你收到这封信之后把它公布。中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将
