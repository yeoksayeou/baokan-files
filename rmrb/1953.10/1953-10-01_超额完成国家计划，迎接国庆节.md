    The 1953 National Day is here. Our team unanimously stated that we will use the practical action of overfulfilling the national plan to respond to the call for increased production and conservation, and to greet the National Day of the first year of the first Five-Year Plan.
    Under the leadership and assistance of the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, and thanks to the joint efforts of all team members, we comprehensively completed the national plan from January to August this year. In terms of output: the average unit output of 32-count yarn reached 0.33 pounds, fulfilling 101.5% of the plan; the average unit output of 21-count yarn reached 0.624 pounds, fulfilling 102% of the plan. The yarn breakage rate decreased every month. In January, the breakage rate of 21-count yarn was 209 breaks (calculated per thousand spindles). In May, the plan was to reduce it to 178 breaks, but the actual rate was reduced to 149 breaks. In August, the plan was to reduce it to 136.6 breaks, but the actual rate was reduced to 111 breaks. The breakage rate was lower than originally planned. The leather roller lapping rate also decreased month by month; for 21-count yarn, it was 0.659% in January. The plan was to reduce it to 0.65% in May, but the actual rate was reduced to 0.597%. The original plan for August was to reduce it to 0.6%, but the actual rate was reduced to 0.391%. According to the measurement and scoring of the Hao Jianxiu work method, the average score was 89.5 points, which exceeded the original target (89 points). The attendance rate averaged 96.2% over eight months, also overfulfilling the plan.
    How did we overfulfill the plan?
    When we first started drafting the plan, everyone didn't realize the importance of this matter. Some said, "Just work with conscience, no need to make a plan." Others said, "Making a plan every month is the same old thing." After studying and conducting criticism and self-criticism, we established the concept of planning and overcame these erroneous ideas. Now everyone's saying is different. For example, team member Sun Guiying said, "Completing the plan will enable the country to build faster, reach socialism sooner, and live a happy life."
    In implementing the production plan, we mainly focused on these three key points: First, earnestly implement the Hao Jianxiu work method; Second, reduce the breakage rate; Third, increase the attendance rate. To solve these problems, we strengthened political and technical learning.
    Once political study was strengthened, everyone's awareness was raised, the spirit of unity and mutual assistance was better than in the past, and the attitude towards labor was also correct. Everyone's difficulties can be resolved in the team in a timely manner. In work, everyone teaches and learns from each other. For example, team member Yan Lifang didn't know how to change roving originally, but Sun Yamei helped her learn. In life, family visits were organized. For example, team member Wu Xiaomei was not getting along with her husband and was arguing about getting a divorce. She cried when working in the workshop, which affected production morale. The team organized several people to go to her home and persuaded her mother-in-law, her husband, and herself separately. They all happily expressed that they must respect and love each other in the future. The next day, her husband even took her to the factory gate. From then on, Wu Xiaomei worked happily and energetically. Such promotion of the spirit of unity and mutual assistance played a great role in doing a good job in the team's production and completing the team's plan.
    In technical learning, the entire team used their brains, found tricks, organized technical exchanges, and worked with technical personnel to improve production. For example, the work of wiping the leather rollers and aprons was originally considered impossible to do during the patrol, so they came to work half an hour earlier to do it. Later, after absorbing the experience of advanced worker Zhu Guó in mastering the replacement of roving and wiping leather rollers and aprons during the patrol, there was no need to come to work half an hour early. This reduced fatigue at work and gave everyone more time to study.
    Although our team has completed the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the state, we still have many shortcomings. Our cultural studies are still poor, and technical exchanges have only just begun. In the future, in the production increase and conservation competition, we must overcome shortcomings and further improve our level of awareness, technology, and culture.
    Now the specific goals for increasing production and conservation that our team has set are: to increase production of 21-count yarn by 30.88 pieces and 32-count yarn by 53.31 pieces for the whole year.
    The unit output for the fourth quarter is 0.6262 pounds per spindle for 21-count yarn and 0.341 pounds per spindle for 32-count yarn. In terms of quality, ensure that both 21-count and 32-count yarns reach 80 points or more. In terms of conservation, although the leather roller lapping rate will increase with increased production, we must ensure that the 21-count yarn does not exceed 0.5% (15 taels per machine) and the 32-count yarn does not exceed 0.65% (1.5 taels per machine). The attendance rate should reach 96.5% (maternity leave, special leave of more than one month, and sick leave are not included). Specific indicators have also been set for other areas such as safe production and operating methods.
    Completing this production increase and conservation plan is glorious and arduous at the same time. We guarantee that we will not be complacent or arrogant, and will humbly learn from brother teams and brother factories. We are full of confidence and determination to strive to overfulfill the task of increasing production and conservation throughout 1953, and use this as a gift for National Day.

    超额完成国家计划，迎接国庆节
    全国纺织工业模范小组小组长

    一九五三年国庆节到了，我们小组一致表示：要用超额完成国家计划的实际行动，响应增产节约的号召，迎接第一个五年计划第一年的国庆节。
    我们小组在党、行政、工会、青年团的领导和帮助下，由于组员的共同努力，今年一月到八月，全面地完成了国家计划。产量方面：三十二支纱平均单位产量达到零点三三磅，完成计划一百零一点五；二十一支纱平均单位产量达到零点六二四磅，完成计划百分之一百零二。纱的断头率每月都有降低，一月份二十一支纱断头是二百零九根（以每千锭计算），五月份计划降到一百七十八根，实际降到一百四十九根；八月份计划降到一百三十六点六根，实际降到一百一十一根，断头率都较原计划为小。皮辊花率也是月月下降；二十一支纱一月份是百分之零点六五九，计划五月份降到百分之零点六五，实际降到百分之零点五九七，原计划八月份降到百分之零点六，实际降到百分之零点三九一。按照郝建秀工作法的测定评分平均为八十九点五分，已超过了原订的指标（八十九分）。出勤率八个月平均是百分之九十六点二，也超额完成了计划。
    我们是怎样超额完成计划的呢？
    开始订计划的时候，大家并没有认识到这件事的重要，有的说“凭良心做工作，用不着订计划”，有的说“月月订计划，老一套”。经过学习和展开批评与自我批评后，我们树立了计划观念，克服了这些错误思想。现在大家的说法不一样了，比方组员孙桂英就说：“完成计划能使国家建设得快，早一些到达社会主义，过幸福生活。”
    在贯彻生产计划当中，我们主要是抓住这样三个关键：第一，认真执行郝建秀工作法；第二，减少断头率；第三，提高出勤率。为了解决这些问题，我们加强了政治和技术学习。
    政治学习一加强，大家的觉悟便提高了，团结互助的精神也比过去好了，劳动态度也端正了。大家有什么困难，在组里都能及时地解决。在工作上，大家互教互学，像组员严莉芳原来不会换粗纱，孙雅美就帮她学会了。在生活上，组织了家庭访问。像组员吴小妹和丈夫不和睦，吵着要离婚，在车间里工作时也哭，影响生产情绪。小组就组织了几个人到她家里去，分别对她的婆婆、丈夫和她本人进行了说服教育，使他们三人都乐意地表示以后一定要互敬、互爱，第二天她丈夫还送她到厂门口，从此吴小妹就工作得愉快有劲了。这样发扬团结互助精神，对搞好小组的生产，完成小组计划起了很大作用。
    在技术学习上，全组动脑筋，找窍门，组织技术交流，和技术人员一道改进生产。像擦皮辊皮啳的工作，本来认为无法在巡回中擦，因此提早半小时上班来做，后来吸收了先进工作者朱帼在巡回时掌握换粗纱和擦皮辊皮啳的经验，就用不着早上班半小时了。这样减少了工作上的疲劳，使大家有了更多的学习时间。
    我们小组虽然完成了党和国家交给我们的任务，可是还有很多缺点，我们的文化学习还差，技术交流也才开始，今后在增产节约竞赛当中，要克服缺点，进一步提高我们的觉悟程度和技术、文化水平。
    现在我们小组订出的增产节约的具体奋斗目标是：全年增产二十一支纱三十点八八件，三十二支纱五十三点三一件。
    第四季度的单位产量二十一支纱锭扯是零点六二六二磅，三十二支纱锭扯为零点三四一磅。质量方面，保证二十一支纱、三十二支纱都达到八十分以上。节约方面，虽然皮辊花率随着增产会增大，但我们要做到：二十一支纱不超过百分之零点五
  （每台车十五两）、三十二支纱不超过百分之零点六五（每台车一两半）。出勤率达到百分之九十六点五（产假特假一月以上，病假不在内）。其它安全生产和操作法等也都订了具体的指标。
    完成这个增产节约计划，是光荣的，同时也是艰巨的。我们保证不自满，不骄傲，虚心向兄弟组、兄弟厂学习，我们满怀信心和决心，为超额完成一九五三年全年增产节约任务而奋斗，并以此作为国庆节的献礼。
