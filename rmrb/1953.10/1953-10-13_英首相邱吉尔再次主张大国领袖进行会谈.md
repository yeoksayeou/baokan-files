Xinhua News Agency, Margate, October 11th: TASS reports that the 73rd annual conference of the British Conservative Party concluded on October 10th in Margate. At the closing session, Prime Minister Churchill spoke on some domestic and foreign policy issues of Britain.

    Churchill called for strengthening Western "defense," saying: "We must do everything possible to promote the establishment of a European army with strong German forces participating. We, like the Americans, must have an armed force in Europe to balance the strength of France and the strength of our new German colleagues. If France does not agree to establish the European Defense Community, then we have no other wise way but to take new measures to incorporate German strength into the strength of the Western allies within the framework of the North Atlantic military bloc."

    Regarding the issue of East-West relations, Churchill said that he "still believes that the leaders of various countries should be able to come together to hold talks."

    英首相邱吉尔再次主张大国领袖进行会谈
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社马尔加特十一日讯：英国保守党第七十三届年会于十月十日在马尔加特闭幕。在闭幕会上，邱吉尔首相发言，谈到一些英国国内政策和外交政策的问题。
    邱吉尔号召加强西方“防务”说：“我们无论如何要尽一切可能促成有强大的德国部队参加的欧洲军的建立。我们和美国人一样，要在欧洲有一支武装力量，以使法国的力量和我们新德国同僚的力量平衡。如果法国不同意建立欧洲防务集团，那么我们就没有其他明智的办法，只有采取新的措施，在北大西洋军事集团的范围内使德国的力量加入西方盟国的力量。”
    谈到东西方关系问题时，邱吉尔说，他“仍然认为，各国的领袖应该有可能聚首一堂，进行会谈。”
