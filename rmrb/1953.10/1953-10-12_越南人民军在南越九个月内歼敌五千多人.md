Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army recently released a communiqué announcing that in the first nine months of this year, the People's Army annihilated a total of over five thousand French invading troops in South Vietnam. The communiqué also listed the People's Army's achievements during this period as follows: sinking sixteen enemy gunboats, shooting down four aircraft, destroying forty-two tanks and trucks, and seizing over seven hundred weapons.

The communiqué stated: Since the end of 1952, the French army has been making every effort to pacify the rich and densely populated South Vietnam. To this end, the French invaders, on the one hand, assembled their mobile units to launch sweeps against the guerrilla bases in western and eastern South Vietnam, attempting to divide the guerrilla bases and force the people to move to the occupied areas; on the other hand, they carried out small-scale sweeps in their rear, capturing young men and destroying and looting the people's grain.

The communiqué pointed out: However, the military and civilians of South Vietnam fiercely struck at the French army's offensive and further expanded their base areas.

The French army suffered heavy blows in various parts of South Vietnam. Between May 29th and June 4th, the People's Army annihilated 400 enemy troops in Kim Oua province and sank and burned five enemy gunboats. In eastern South Vietnam, the People's Army victoriously conducted anti-sweeping operations in June and July. For example, on June 18th, they annihilated 160 enemy troops, and then removed the Go Lua stronghold, which was defended by a company of troops, capturing fifteen tons of ammunition and equipment. In the battle to remove the Go Lua stronghold, eighty puppet soldiers surrendered to the People's Army.

The enemy launched a large-scale offensive against the Plain of Reeds in South Vietnam in late July, but was also repelled by the People's Army. The People's Army crushed an invading enemy battalion on July 25th, capturing the battalion commander alive, which caused great confusion to the enemy. As a result, more than 600 puppet soldiers abandoned twenty-five strongholds and watchtowers and fled.

In addition, the People's Army's offensive in the enemy's rear areas in South Vietnam forced the enemy to withdraw from twenty strongholds and watchtowers.

Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Some Bao Dai's new puppet army light infantry battalions, hastily put together according to the French Navarre's new military plan, suffered devastating blows from the Vietnam People's Army as soon as they were put into the Red River Delta battlefield.

A spokesman for the French invading army in Vietnam admitted on the 5th that the Bao Dai light infantry battalion, which had taken over from the French army to independently guard the Bei Zhu area southeast of Hanoi in early September, "has suffered heavy losses in the past month." On October 6th, the Bao Dai puppet army was attacked again, and Agence France-Presse admitted that this time Bao Dai's troops "suffered significant losses." An Associated Press reporter wrote anxiously while reporting on the Bao Dai light infantry battalion being repeatedly and fiercely attacked by the People's Army:

"The Viet Minh army's sudden and continuous attacks on the newly formed Vietnamese light infantry battalions" "seems to have started a campaign aimed at eliminating the Vietnamese light infantry battalions in the Red River Delta."

The Bao Dai puppet army's low combat effectiveness and demoralized morale have prevented the French invading army authorities from withdrawing its mobile units as much as originally planned to launch offensives in order to get rid of the French army's passive position. An Associated Press dispatch reflected this predicament of the French military headquarters, saying: "Daily war reports in the past few months have revealed that the French army must repeatedly engage in combat in order to prevent strongholds defended by Vietnamese or Vietnamese troops (referring to the Bao Dai puppet army) from being eliminated by the Viet Minh." It also said: Although the French army has taken great pains to train these troops, the daily war reports in recent weeks have been "filled" with news of strongholds defended by the Bao Dai puppet army falling into the hands of the People's Army.

Faced with the Vietnam People's Army's intensified offensive, the French military is extremely uneasy about the Bao Dai puppet army, which is vulnerable to attack. A United Press reporter wrote from Hanoi: Although "France's success or failure in future battles will depend on the hastily recruited, trained, new Vietnamese army," the current situation of these troops "is causing widespread anxiety."

    越南人民军在南越九个月内歼敌五千多人
    【新华社十日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总司令部最近发表的公报宣布：今年头九个月，人民军在南越一共歼灭法国侵略军五千多人。公报并列举人民军在这一时期的战果如下：击沉敌军炮艇十六艘，击落飞机四架，击毁坦克、卡车四十二辆，并缴获七百多件武器。
    公报说：从一九五二年年底以来，法军竭力企图平定富饶和人口稠密的南越。为此，法国侵略者一面纠集它的机动部队向在南越西部和东部的游击根据地发动扫荡，企图割裂游击根据地，强迫人民移向占领区；一面又在它们后方进行小规模的扫荡，捕捉壮丁，毁坏和抢劫人民的谷物。
    公报指出：但是，南越军民猛烈打击法军的进攻，并进一步扩大了自己的根据地。
    法军在南越各地遭到了沉重的打击。在五月二十九日和六月四日间，人民军在金瓯省歼灭敌军四百人，击沉和烧毁敌军炮艇五艘。在南越东部，人民军于六、七两月间胜利地进行了反扫荡战，例如，在六月十八日歼灭敌军一百六十名，接着又拔除了有一连军队防守的鹅垒据点，缴获十五吨弹药装备。在拔除鹅垒据点的战斗中，有八十名伪军向人民军投降。
    敌军在七月下旬曾向南越水草平原发动了一次大规模的进攻，也被人民军击退。人民军在七月二十五日击溃了进犯的敌军一个营，活捉该营营长，这使敌军非常混乱。伪军六百多名因此丢弃了二十五个据点和瞭望塔逃跑。
    此外，人民军在南越敌后地区的进攻，迫使敌军撤出了二十个据点和瞭望塔。
    【新华社九日讯】根据法国的纳瓦尔新军事计划而匆忙拼凑起来的一些保大新伪军轻装营，刚投入红河三角洲战场就遭到越南人民军的毁灭性打击。
    侵越法军发言人五日承认：九月初接替法军单独驻守河内东南裴朱地区的保大轻装营，“在过去
    一个月中遭到惨重的损失”。十月六日，保大伪军再次受到进攻，法新社承认，这次保大的部队“受到的损失是重大的”。美联社记者在报道保大轻装营不断遭到人民军的猛烈袭击时惶惶不安地写道：
    “越盟军队对新组成的越南轻装营的突然和连续的进攻”，“似乎已开始了一个目的在消灭红河三角洲的越南轻装营的战役”。
    保大伪军的低弱的战斗力和萎靡的士气，使侵越法军当局不能像原来计划的那样尽量把它的机动部队抽调出来发动进攻，以摆脱法军的被动地位。美联社的一条电讯反映了法军司令部的这种苦恼状况，消息说：“过去几月来的每日战报透露：法军必须一再地投入战斗，以便防止由越南人防守的据点或越南部队（指保大伪军）遭到越盟的消灭。”又说：法军虽然煞费苦心训练这些部队，但是最近几周来的每日战报却“塞满”了由保大伪军防守的据点落到人民军手里这一类的消息。
    面对着越南人民军的加强进攻，法国军方对不堪一击的保大伪军极感不安。合众社记者从河内发出的消息写道：虽然“法国在未来的战斗中的成败将系于匆匆征募的、经过训练的、新的越南军”，但是这些军队目前的情况“引起了广泛的焦虑”。
