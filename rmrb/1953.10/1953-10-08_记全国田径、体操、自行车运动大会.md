    Record of the National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Games
    Xiao Yuan
    The National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Games have concluded. Six hundred and fifty-eight outstanding athletes from the motherland's border regions, the Inner Mongolian grasslands, coastal provinces and cities, and the heartland of the Central Plains, displayed a spirit of creativity under the slogan "Create New Records for the Motherland." After six days of intense competition, the athletes broke nineteen national records; the gymnastics and cycling competitions also achieved excellent results. At the closing ceremony on October 7, over 20,000 spectators cheered these glorious achievements. People were not only proud that the motherland has such outstanding athletes, but also thrilled that the motherland's sports endeavors will be better developed.
    On the opening day of the Games, the sky was clear and cloudless. Guided by the Five-Starred Red Flag and countless colored flags, the athletes, men and women, dressed in bright sportswear, were full of spirit and strode forward with vigor, receiving the review of Vice Premier of the Government Administration Council, Guo Moruo, Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, He Long, and the heads of various ministries and commissions.
    After 2,000 male and female students from Beijing and 500 soldiers from the Public Security Forces performed "Labor and Defense" exercises and group calisthenics, the competition began. On the track and in the field, the robust athletes displayed the youthful vitality of the new generation of Chinese youth.
    In the women's hand grenade throwing preliminary and final rounds, more than ten athletes engaged in fierce competition. Yang Yizhuang and Zhang Jiaqi from the People's Liberation Army, Ma Shuchun from the Northeast, K Maoji from the Northwest, Zhou Jian from East China, and Liu Fu from North China qualified for the finals. Yang Yizhuang and Liu Fu were evenly matched opponents. Liu Fu's final throw reached 45.21 meters, breaking her own national record and winning the championship. Yang Yizhuang and Zhang Jiaqi took second and third place respectively; their scores also broke the national record.
    The good news of female athletes breaking national records came one after another. In the women's shot put final, Luo Yunqi from the People's Liberation Army and Shi Baozhu from the Northeast broke the national records with 12.19 meters and 11.82 meters respectively, taking first and second place. When Luo Yunqi's shot put passed the small yellow flag marking the "national record," Wang Canhua, the original national record holder, warmly shook hands with Luo Yunqi to congratulate her on creating a brand new sports record for the motherland. The most intense competition was the women's 800-meter final, a track event that requires both speed and endurance. Before liberation, women's track events were at most 200 meters, and 400 meters was a relay. The athletes participating in this final encouraged each other to raise their scores to a new level. As a result, not only did Wen Liping from the People's Liberation Army, who won first place, break the national record with a time of 2 minutes 33.1 seconds, but also Zhang Fushun from Inner Mongolia, Sun Hongxia from the Railways, Zhao Guizhi from the Northeast, who won second, third and fourth place, and Li Shaofang from the People's Liberation Army, who won fifth place, all broke the national record.
    Echoing the outstanding achievements of the female athletes was the men's middle-distance competition. Whether it was 400 meters, 800 meters, or 1,500 meters, all broke the national record. Among them, the 1,500-meter race was the most intense and fierce. Among the twelve athletes who qualified for the final were Yan Zhangzhao and Shi Qin, 23-year-old athletes from the People's Liberation Army; Li Qi, our country's athlete who attended the Fourth World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival; and You Yunting, a worker athlete who has diligently studied and trained and achieved excellent results in middle and long-distance races, and Zhang Wei, a railway worker. In the competition, Yan Zhangzhao crossed the finish line in 4 minutes 7.2 seconds, breaking the national record, and Li Qi, Shi Qin, and Bai Liangwu also arrived one after another. The scores of the top three all broke the national record.
    The new sports ethics of "unity, friendship, and active progress" were prominently displayed in various competitions. Wang Yong'an, an athlete from the North China region who broke the national record of 57.9 seconds in the 400-meter intermediate hurdles with a time of 57.1 seconds, said: "Creating a new record is not only a personal honor, but also has great political significance." Because the athletes of New China know that the creation of new records demonstrates the development and achievements of New China's sports, and also shows the improvement of people's health.
    October 6, the fifth day of the Games, was also the most exciting day. Good news of breaking national records in men's and women's track and field events came one after another. The announcer had just reported that Jiang Yumin, an athlete from the People's Liberation Army, had created an excellent result of 1 minute and 2 seconds in the women's 400 meters, and immediately broadcasted the results of Liu Zheng from the North China region and Wen Yunzhen from the People's Liberation Army breaking the national record of 12.9 seconds in the women's 80-meter low hurdles with 12.6 seconds and 12.8 seconds respectively. A burst of applause suddenly rang out in the southeast corner of the stadium, as the women's javelin throw final began. Yang Yizhuang's javelin from the People's Liberation Army flew past the small yellow flag marking the "national record" and exceeded the small triangular iron flag marking the broken national record of Zhang Guixiu from East China, with a score of 34.12 meters. Liu Yuying, a sprint expert from the Northeast who won first place in the 100 meters and broke the national record, created a new national record of 27.1 seconds in the 200-meter final. Thousands of spectators in the northeast corner of the stadium cheered for Gao Shugui, a long jumper from the People's Liberation Army, who broke the national record of 6.912 meters, which had not been broken for 20 years in our country, with a score of 6.93 meters.
    The men's 5,000-meter long-distance race began. Twenty-seven long-distance runners, with a spirit of courage and steadfastness, advanced rapidly. The famous long-distance runners: Yi Taotege, a Mongolian youth from the People's Liberation Army, Wang Qing'en and Zhang Xiling from the Northeast, You Yunting and Li Qi from East China, Zhang Yuncheng from Inner Mongolia, and Fu Shenghai from the Railways, etc., were overtaking each other, and the competition became fierce in the last 800 meters. Yi Taotege went all out and sprinted bravely, crossing the finish line first with a brilliant score of 15 minutes and 48 seconds. Then, Zhang Xiling, Li Qi, and You Yunting also reached the finish line one after another, and the scores of the top three all broke the national record of 15 minutes and 56.2 seconds.
    The men's hand grenade throw was the last event in the field and track event on the 6th. The outstanding athletes did not disappoint everyone, and the top three winners, Liu Chengbang from the Railways, Li Binzheng from the Northwest, and Zhang Zhongshan from the People's Liberation Army, all broke the national record.
    The National Cycling Competition was held for the first time. The male and female athletes from the People's Liberation Army, known for their fortitude and courage, occupied a significant advantage in this competition. The top three in the men's 10,000-meter final, Jiang Defu, Qian Huaiyu, and Yu Shengtao, were all athletes from the People's Liberation Army. They competed in the same group, advancing at high speed, end to end. Amidst the cheers of the audience, Jiang Defu and Qian Huaiyu reached the finish line with the same time of 18 minutes and 24.1 seconds, and Yu Shengtao was only 0.6 seconds behind.
    Like the cycling competition, the gymnastics competition was also held for the first time. Sixty-seven athletes from eight units participated in the competition. Their competitions and performances also achieved good results. Comrade A. Polezhaev, the coach of the women's team of the Soviet Sports Delegation visiting China, praised our country's female gymnasts at a symposium. Male and female gymnasts were encouraged and guided by outstanding Soviet gymnasts at this meeting. They studied and watched the excellent gymnastics performances of the Soviet sports delegation, which will definitely be of great help to the improvement of gymnastics techniques in our country in the future.
    On the 7th, at the closing ceremony of the Games, when Rong Gaotang, Secretary-General of the Congress Presidium and the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, announced that a total of nineteen national records had been broken in all track and field events, the audience celebrated the victory of this sports meet with prolonged applause.
    As Comrade He Long, Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, pointed out in his opening speech: The sports cause of New China is developing rapidly. With the arrival of a new period of construction, the sports cause will surely show a newer face.

    记全国田径、体操、自行车运动大会
    晓远
    全国田径、体操、自行车运动大会闭幕了。来自祖国边疆、内蒙草原、滨海省市和中原腹地的六百五十八名优秀选手，在“为祖国创造新纪录”的口号下，发扬了创造性的精神。经过六天的紧张比赛，运动员们打破了十九项全国最高纪录；体操、自行车竞赛也获得优良的成绩。十月七日的闭幕会上，两万余观众为这些光辉的成就发出了欢呼。人们不仅为祖国有这批卓越的运动选手感到骄傲，而且为祖国的体育运动事业将得到更好的开展而振奋。
    在运动会开幕的那一天，晴空万里，在五星红旗和无数面彩旗的导引下，穿着鲜艳运动衣的男女健儿们，个个精神奕奕，迈开雄健的步伐，接受了政务院副总理郭沫若、中央人民政府体育运动委员会主任贺龙和各部院首长的检阅。
    在北京市两千名男女学生和五百名公安部队战士表演“劳卫”操和集体操后，竞赛便开始了。跑道上和田径场地里，健壮的运动员们显示出新中国青年一代的青春活力。
    女子掷手榴弹预决赛中，十余名选手展开了激烈的竞争。人民解放军的杨一庄、张家琪、东北的马树春、西北的卡毛吉、华东的周健和华北的刘馥获得决赛权。杨一庄和刘馥是旗鼓相当的对手。刘馥最后一掷，达到四十五公尺二十一公分，突破她自己所保持的全国最高纪录，获得冠军。杨一庄和张家琪分别取得第二、三名；她们的成绩，也突破了全国最高纪录。
      女运动员突破全国最高纪录的捷报，接连传来。女子铅球决赛结果，人民解放军选手罗运琪和东北选手石宝珠分别以十二公尺十九公分和十一公尺八十二公分突破了全国最高纪录，取得第一、二名。当罗运琪的铅球越过标志“全国纪录”的小黄旗后，原全国纪录保持者王灿华，亲密地向罗运琪握手祝贺，庆贺她为祖国创造了全新的运动纪录。竞争得最激烈的是女子八百公尺决赛，这是一项既需要速度、又需要耐久力的径赛项目。解放前，女子径赛最多跑二百公尺，四百公尺就是接力了。参加这项决赛的运动员们，相互鼓励，要把成绩提高到新的水平。决赛结果，不仅获得第一名的人民解放军选手温丽萍以二分三十三秒一的成绩突破全国最高纪录，第二、三、四名的内蒙选手张福顺、铁路选手孙洪霞、东北选手赵桂芝和第五名的人民解放军选手李少芳，也都打破了全国纪录。
    和女运动员的优异成就互相辉映的，是男子中距离竞赛。无论四百公尺，八百公尺或一千五百公尺，都打破了全国最高纪录。其中一千五百公尺竞赛最为紧张、激烈。取得决赛权的十二名选手中，有二十三岁的人民解放军选手严章照、石勤；有出席第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的我国选手李琦；也有勤学苦练、在中距离和长距离竞赛中获得优异成绩的工人选手酉云亭和铁路职工张威等。在竞赛中，严章照以四分七秒二的成绩突破终点红线，李琦、石勤、白良武也先后到达。前三名的成绩，都突破了全国最高纪录。
    “团结友爱、积极进取”的新的体育道德作风，在各项竞赛中表现得很突出。以五十七秒一破全国四百公尺中栏五十七秒九纪录的华北区选手王永安说：“创造新纪录，不仅是个人的荣誉，而且是具有重大的政治意义的。”因为新中国的运动员都知道，新纪录的创造，说明着新中国体育运动的发展和成就，也显示着人民健康水平的提高。
    十月六日，大会第五天，也是令人最兴奋的一天，男、女田径赛接二连三地传出打破全国最高纪录的捷报。广播员刚刚报告了人民解放军选手姜玉民以一分二秒创造了女子四百公尺的优异成绩，马上又播送华北区选手刘正和人民解放军选手文蕴珍分别以十二秒六和十二秒八突破女子八十公尺低栏十二秒九的全国纪录的战果。运动场东南角忽然响起了一片掌声，女子组标枪掷远决赛开始了。人民解放军选手杨一庄的标枪飞过了“全国纪录”的小黄旗，又超过了标志已破全国纪录的华东选手张桂秀的三角小铁旗，成绩是三十四点十二公尺。获得一百公尺第一名、突破全国最高纪录的短跑能手东北选手刘玉英，在二百公尺决赛中，又创造了二十七秒一的全国最高成绩。场地东北角数千观众为创新纪录的人民解放军跳远选手高树贵助威。他以六公尺九十三公分的成绩，打破了我国二十年来一直未打破的六公尺九十一点二公分的全国最高纪录。
    男子五千公尺长跑决赛开始了。二十七名长跑选手，以勇往直前的精神，稳健地急速前进。著名的长跑健将们：人民解放军中的蒙族青年伊套特格、东北选手王清恩、张希苓、华东选手酉云亭和李琦、内蒙选手张云程、铁路选手傅生海等，互相超越着，到最后八百公尺时，竞争趋白热化。伊套特格一鼓作气，勇猛冲刺，以十五分四十八秒的光辉成绩首破红线。接着，张希苓、李琦和酉云亭也先后冲达终点，前三名的成绩又都突破了全国十五分五十六秒二的成绩。
    男子手榴弹投远是六日田径赛中最后一个项目。优秀的选手们，没有辜负大家的期望，铁路选手刘成邦、西北选手李斌正、人民解放军选手张仲山等前三名的优胜者，都打破了全国纪录。
    全国自行车竞赛，这还是第一次。以刚毅、勇敢著称的人民解放军男女选手们，在这项竞赛中，占了显著的优势。男子一万公尺决赛前三名姜德富、钱怀玉、于声桃，都是人民解放军选手，他们在同一个组里决赛，飞速前进，首尾相接。在观众的欢呼声中，姜德富和钱怀玉同以十八分二十四秒一的时间到达终点，于声桃相差也只有零点六秒。
    和自行车比赛一样，体操比赛也还是第一次。参加比赛的有八个单位六十七名选手。他们的比赛和表演，也有了良好的成绩。来华访问的苏联体育代表团女子队教练阿·波列热耶夫同志在一次座谈会上，赞扬了我国女子体操选手。男女体操选手在这次会上受到了苏联优秀的体操运动家的鼓励和指导。他们学习和观摩了苏联体育代表团卓越的体操表演，这对我国今后体操技术的提高一定会有很大的帮助。
    七日，在大会闭幕典礼上，当大会主席团、中央人民政府体育运动委员会秘书长荣高棠宣布全部田径竞赛项目，共有十九项打破了全国最高纪录时，观众用经久不息的掌声来庆贺这次运动大会的胜利。
    正如中央人民政府体育运动委员会主任贺龙同志在开幕词中指出的：新中国体育运动事业，正在飞跃地向前发展。伴随着新的建设时期的到来，体育运动事业，一定会出现一个更新的面貌。
