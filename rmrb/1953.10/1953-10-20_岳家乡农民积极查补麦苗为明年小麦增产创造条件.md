    Farmers in Yuejia Township Actively Inspect and Replenish Wheat Seedlings to Create Conditions for Increased Wheat Production Next Year
    Yang Qinzi of the Zibo Prefectural Office of Shandong Province writes: Yuejia Township in the suburbs of Zibo City suffered from an autumn drought this year, resulting in incomplete wheat seedling emergence. Yue Hongfen's 1.2 mu of wheat field had an emergence rate of only 50%; Qu Fucheng's 1.5 mu of wheat had an emergence rate of less than 70%. The township's Party branch mobilized farmers to inspect and replenish seedlings. On October 1st, the Meng Qingkai mutual aid team found that one-fifth of their two mu of wheat on the southern slope was missing seedlings. The next day, a full laborer and a half laborer went to carry water to replenish the seedlings. Xing Weibin and Qin Guangcheng used kettles to water the unsprouted wheat rows (due to the lack of water conservancy conditions in the mountainous area) to encourage and replenish seedlings. Farmers throughout the township are actively inspecting and replenishing seedlings to create conditions for increased wheat production next year.

    岳家乡农民积极查补麦苗为明年小麦增产创造条件
    山东省淄博专署杨钦孜来信：淄博市郊区岳家乡今年遭到秋旱，小麦有出苗不全的现象。岳洪芬的一亩二分麦田，出苗率只占百分之五十；曲福成的一亩半麦，出苗不到百分之七十。这个乡的党支部就发动农民查苗补苗。孟庆凯互助组十月一日查到南坡二亩麦缺苗五分之一，第二天就由一个整劳力和一个半劳力去挑水补苗。邢为彬、秦光成用水壶顺着没出苗的麦垅浇水（因山区没有水利条件）追苗、补苗。全乡农民都在积极地查苗补苗，为明年小麦增产创造条件。
