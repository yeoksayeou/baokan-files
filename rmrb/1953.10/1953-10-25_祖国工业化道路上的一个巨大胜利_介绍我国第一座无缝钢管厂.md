    A Great Victory on the Road to Socialist Industrialization
    ——Introducing China's First Seamless Steel Tube Plant

    The seamless steel tubes that the Chinese people have long awaited will soon be produced at the newly built seamless steel tube plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. This is a victory in our industrial construction and great joyful news for the people of the whole country.

    The newly built seamless steel tube plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is one of the key construction projects in our Five-Year Construction Plan. The entire factory structure is built with thousands of tons of metal and building materials. Above and below the factory buildings, various shapes of pipelines and conduits for transporting electricity, water, air, gas, wind, etc., are densely crisscrossed, totaling hundreds of miles in length. On the foundation poured with tens of thousands of cubic meters of concrete, various large mechanical equipment and precision electrical equipment weighing thousands of tons are neatly installed. Among these equipment, the mechanical equipment for rolling and reducing the diameter of steel tubes, which is only one of the nearly thirty processes in the entire plant, is loaded with twenty-one train carriages. This factory is also equipped with various automatic control and instrument control devices; individual drive devices for machine equipment; a lubrication system for maintaining machines and automatically recovering waste oil; finished product inspection devices for controlling quality; telecommunications equipment for production liaison; and various new safety equipment and emergency lighting equipment. Because this factory is equipped with many mechanized and automated equipment, it is possible to manufacture various seamless steel tubes at an astonishing speed while utilizing more economical raw materials.

    The seamless steel tube plant was built with the most advanced Soviet technology achievements. The entire factory was designed by the Soviet Union; many excellent Soviet experts directly participated in the construction of this factory; and the entire set of the latest mechanical equipment in the factory was also provided by the Soviet government. Therefore, after this factory is completed, its technical level will exceed that of steel rolling mills in capitalist countries. In capitalist countries, heavy manual labor accounts for a large proportion of steel rolling mills, and workers often work in high temperatures, and machines devour their health. When designing my country's newly built seamless steel tube plant, Soviet experts took into consideration the improvement of workers' working conditions in every aspect. The entire plant is equipped with a lubrication system for maintaining the machinery, which can not only automatically oil the machines in a timely manner but also automatically recover waste oil, filter it, and then send it back to the machines for use. The factory has a huge main electrical room, which manages hundreds of battery stations, thousands of motors, and hundreds of electrical control boxes. The rotation of various mechanical equipment in the entire factory is controlled by this electrical equipment. The entire production process requires workers not to perform heavy labor but rather to apply science and technology. Workers who have mastered science and technology can manufacture various steel tubes by simply sitting at workbenches far away from the mechanical equipment and pressing the buttons on the control box. In old steel rolling mills, workers working in the heating furnace section had to endure high-temperature baking for feeding materials and watching the furnace, which often resulted in many defective products due to inaccurate temperature control and poor heating. The heating process of my country's newly built seamless steel tube plant has completely changed this situation. The entire working process of the heating furnace, except for individual operations, only requires workers to press buttons, and the steel billets can be automatically loaded into and unloaded from the furnace. At the same time, several metering devices are specifically used to control the temperature and wind force inside the furnace. If it is necessary to adjust the temperature and wind force, just move the pointer of the meter. If there is a possibility of a dangerous accident in the furnace, the alarm bell will ring automatically. Electrical workers in the main electrical room can know the operating conditions of all motors on the other side of the wall from the instruments. When the motor overheats, a red light will turn on. At this time, if no one has adjusted it, the automatic device will immediately stop supplying power. There are many such devices to reduce workers' labor and protect personal safety. Many aspects of the various mechanized and automated equipment in this factory have greatly exceeded the technical standards of capitalist countries.

    The construction speed of this factory is relatively fast, and the project quality is good. It has only been built for just over a year since July last year, and it will soon be put into production. The construction of the seamless steel tube plant is a severe test for the people and the working class of our country. This factory is not only large in scale but also extremely complex in technology. For example, in the concrete foundation project, nearly 20,000 anchor bolts need to be installed, but the tolerance of each bolt to the center line must not exceed three to five millimeters; otherwise, thousands of meters of concrete foundation will have to be redone. Many important mechanical equipment in the entire factory must be installed on certain center lines and elevation points without any deviation. If the elevation differs by even one dao (the thickness of a hair, about equal to eight dao), it must be reworked.

    The completion of the new seamless steel tube plant and its imminent commissioning have a very important role in ensuring the completion of our Five-Year Construction Plan. Seamless steel tubes have a wide range of uses and are an indispensable and important material in industrial construction. Its pressure resistance is many times greater than that of welded steel tubes, and it is lighter than welded steel tubes. Therefore, the frames of airplanes and high-pressure oil pipes, warships, ships, locomotive boilers and various factory-used boiler tubes, drill pipes and casings for geological exploration and oil exploitation, oil pipes and air compression pipes used in factories and mining machinery, and urban transportation of water, heating, gas, etc., are all inseparable from it. In the period of entering the Five-Year Construction Plan, the rich resources hidden underground in our country will be extensively explored and exploited; many new iron and steel enterprises, non-ferrous metal smelting plants, oil refineries, machine manufacturing plants, automobile manufacturing plants, tractor manufacturing plants, power stations, and various light industrial factories will be established one after another; the scale of coal mine and oil field exploitation in our country will be further expanded; and the construction area of ​​various cities will also be greatly increased. All these construction projects are urgently awaiting the production of this seamless steel tube plant.

    The completion of the new seamless steel tube plant has also laid a good foundation for our country to establish more steel tube rolling plants. For more than a year, Chinese workers and technicians who are preparing to participate in the production of this modern factory have basically mastered various operating techniques for rolling seamless steel tubes after interning in the Soviet Union with the help and training of Soviet experts. The growth of this batch of new technical talents provides conditions for the construction of new tube rolling plants in the future.

    The birth of the new seamless steel tube plant will greatly change the face of my country's industry. In the past, our country could never manufacture seamless steel tubes, and various industries could only purchase them from abroad when needed. Now, the completion and commissioning of my country's first seamless steel tube plant can fundamentally change this situation.

    祖国工业化道路上的一个巨大胜利
    ——介绍我国第一座无缝钢管厂
    新华社记者  孙铭惠
    中国人民盼望已久的无缝钢管，很快就要从鞍山钢铁公司新建的无缝钢管厂中生产出来了。这是我国工业建设上的一个胜利，是全国人民的一个大喜讯。
    鞍山钢铁公司新建的无缝钢管厂，是我国五年建设计划中的重点建设工程之一。全部厂房结构是用几千吨金属和建筑材料建成的。厂房内外的空中和地下，纵横交错地密布着输送电、水、空气、瓦斯、风等各种形状的管道和电线管，总长达数百里。在几万立方公尺混凝土浇灌成的基础上，整齐地安装着重约数千吨的各种庞大的机械设备和精密的电气设备。在这些设备中，只是作为全厂近三十道工序之一的轧减钢管口径的机械设备，就装了二十一个火车车皮。这座工厂中，还设有各种自动操纵和仪器控制装置；有机器设备的单独传动装置；有为保养机器和自动回收废油的滑润系统；有控制质量的成品检查装置和作为生产连络用的电讯设备；有各种新式的安全设备和事故照明设备等。由于这个工厂安装了许多机械化自动化的设备，就可能在利用较经济的原材料的条件下，以惊人的速度制造各种无缝钢管。
    无缝钢管厂是用苏联最先进的技术成就建设起来的。整个工厂是由苏联设计的；许多优秀的苏联专家，直接参加了这个工厂的建设；工厂内全套最新式的机械设备，也都是由苏联政府供给的。因此，这个工厂建成以后，它的技术水平将超过资本主义国家的轧钢工厂。在资本主义国家中，轧钢工厂中繁重的手工劳动占了很大的比重，工人们常常冒着高温工作，机器吞噬了他们的健康。我国新建的无缝钢管厂，在苏联专家设计时，就处处考虑到改善工人的劳动条件。全厂设有保养机械的滑润系统，它不但可以适时地给机器自动上油，并能自动把废油收回，进行过滤，滤后再送给机器使用。工厂内设有巨大的主电室，管理着几百个电池站、成千台电动机和上百台的电气操纵箱，全厂各种机械设备的转动，就是由这个电气设备操纵的。整个生产过程要求工人的已不是繁重的劳动，而是科学和技术，掌握了科学技术的工人们只要坐在离机械设备很远的工作台上，按按操作箱上的电钮，各种钢管就可以制造出来。旧轧钢工厂中，在加热炉部分工作的工人，要冒着高温的熏烤，进行拨料和看炉，这样往往由于温度掌握不准，加热不良，造成许多废品。我国新建无缝钢管厂的加热过程，就完全改变了这种情况。整个加热炉的工作过程，除个别操作外，只要工人按按电钮，钢坯就可以自动地进炉和出炉，同时有几台计器装置，专门掌握炉内的温度高低和风力大小等情况。如果需要调整温度和风力，只要拨一下计器的指针就行了。如果炉内有发生危险事故的可能，警铃就自动响起来。主电室里的电气工人，从仪器上就可以知道隔墙所有电动机运转的情形。马达过热时，就有红灯亮了起来。这时，如果还没有人去调整，自动装置就立即停止送电。这种为减轻工人劳动、保护人身安全的装置是很多的。这座工厂的各种机械化自动化的设备装置，有许多方面已大大超过了资本主义国家的技术水准。
    这座工厂施工速度比较快，工程质量良好。从去年七月起，到现在仅仅建设了一年多的时间，很快就要投入生产了。无缝钢管厂的建设是对我国人民和工人阶级的一个严重的考验。这座工厂不但规模浩大，而且技术极为复杂，例如：在混凝土基础工程上，要安装近两万个地脚螺丝，每个和中心线的公差却不得超过三个公厘到五个公厘，否则成千公尺的混凝土基础就得重做。全厂有许多重要的机械设备，要丝毫不差地安装在一定的中心线与标高点上，如果标高差上一道（一根头发粗细约等于八道）也要重新返工。
    新建无缝钢管厂的完工和它很快地投入生产，对保证我国五年建设计划的完成有很重大的作用。无缝钢管的用途很广，是工业建设中一项不可缺少的重要器材。它比有缝钢管的抗压力大许多倍，又比有缝钢管轻，所以飞机的骨架和高压油管，军舰、船舶、火车头和各种工厂用的锅炉管，地质钻探和石油开采用的钻杆及套管，工厂、矿山机械上用的油管、空气压缩管和城市输送水、暖气、瓦斯等，都离不开它。在进入五年建设计划的时期，蕴藏在我国地下的丰富的资源，将得到大量的勘察和开采；许多新的钢铁企业、有色金属冶炼厂、煤油厂、机器制造厂、汽车制造厂、拖拉机制造厂、电力站以及各种轻工业工厂等，将陆续建立起来；我国的煤矿和油田的开采规模将进一步地扩大；各个城市的建筑面积也要大大增加。所有这些建设工程，都在急迫地等待着这座无缝钢管厂的生产。
    新建无缝钢管厂的建成，还为我国建立更多的钢管轧制工厂打下了良好的基础。一年多以来，准备参加这个现代化工厂生产的中国工人和技术人员，经过到苏联实习以后在苏联专家的帮助培养下，已基本掌握了轧制无缝钢管的各种操作技术。这一批新的技术人材的成长，为今后建设新的轧管厂提供了条件。
    新建无缝钢管厂的诞生，将大大改变我国工业的面貌。过去我国从来不能制造无缝钢管，各种工业需要时，只能向国外购买。现在，我国第一座无缝钢管厂的建成和它的投入生产，就可以根本改变这种情况。
