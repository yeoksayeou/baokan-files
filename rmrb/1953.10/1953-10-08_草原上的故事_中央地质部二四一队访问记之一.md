Stories on the Grassland
——A Visit to the Central Geological Department’s Team 241 (Part 1)
Fan Rongkang

	This is a boundless grassland. On the grassland, there are no villages, no cultivated land. The Central Geological Department’s Team 241 has been conducting iron ore exploration work here for more than three years. In the near future, a new type of heavy industrial city will appear on this wasteland.

	More than three years ago, the secret of this grassland had not yet been revealed. Like all the grasslands in northern China, it was covered by ice and snow for more than half the year. Two or three Mongolian girls herded sheep here. Year after year, the sheep nibbled at the green grass, often startled by something, crowding together and running. The tall, fat shepherd dogs guarded the flock. The shepherd girls stood behind the sheep, staring motionlessly into the distance of the grassland, silently counting the passing years. So many years passed, and the grassland was still so desolate, often haunted by wolves, snakes, and wild rabbits darting across the grassland like lightning. Ground squirrels dug countless burrows in the grass, and occasionally large eagles swooped down over the grassland. Because of the rampant wolves, this place was called "Wolf Market Pass."

	On this endless green grassland stands a mountain. This mountain is what is now called the Main Mine, the main area where Team 241 is conducting exploration work. They discovered that it contains abundant iron ore. However, since ancient times, the people of the grassland have cherished this mountain, calling it "Treasure Mountain." The remains of Mongolian heroes of past generations are buried on this Treasure Mountain. The tombs also contain the military uniforms, weapons, and various mementos used by the heroes during their lives. They forbid anyone from moving a blade of grass or a stone on this Treasure Mountain, lest they disturb the slumbering heroes. Every year, Mongolians from all directions come to hold regular grand sacrificial ceremonies.

	In May 1950, the Central People's Government dispatched geological engineer Yan Kunyuan and twenty drilling workers, led by veteran driller Zhang Jianxun, who had twenty years of experience, with a drilling rig to this grassland. Accompanying the geological exploration team was also a Mongolian cavalry company and an infantry platoon (because at that time, Kuomintang bandits were still roaming the grassland). May was the beautiful early summer. South of the Yangtze River, all kinds of flowers were in full bloom, while the grassland was still slumbering in a vast expanse of snow. This vanguard of the country's economic construction could not find houses or water here. They set up yurts, dug ancient wells, and installed the first drilling rig on the main mine, probing into the heart of the grassland. The cavalry, with the assistance of the Mongolian people, annihilated the scattered bandits on the grassland. In this battle, the geological exploration team and the Mongolian people forged an unbreakable friendship.

	The short summer on the grassland passed quickly, and snow and severe cold were soon to arrive. According to the original plan, this geological exploration team was not prepared to spend the winter here. However, a new order came from the state, requiring the drilling workers to persist in winter work, and another drilling rig and another group of drilling workers were allocated. The winter on the grassland was still an unbreakable mystery to the drilling workers who had just arrived. No one knew how cold it would get, no one knew whether the fuel and water would freeze. At this time, the Mongolian people and the local autonomous government provided the geological exploration team with information about the winter climate and various suggestions for making insulation equipment. In this winter, all the wells were coated with horse manure and covered with yurts, with fires burning day and night to prevent the well water from freezing. Also in this winter, the first house was built on the grassland. All the workers received leather coats, leather hats, leather gloves, and leather boots. All the equipment to fight the severe cold was ready. The drilling team thus successfully survived the first winter.

	By the winter of 1952, the data possessed by the geological workers could already judge how conservative the estimates of the iron ore reserves here by Japanese imperialists and other geological workers in the past were. New data proved that the reserves of this iron ore exceeded the past estimates not by tens of percent, but by hundreds of percent. Geological workers not only proved that the main mine was a large ore body, but also inferred that the outcrop of the ore body in the East Mine might also be a continuous whole. This inference was confirmed by physical prospecting in 1951.

	The exploration work continued under the encouragement of these good news. However, in the winter of this year, unprecedented difficulties were encountered. In this winter, the number of drilling rigs increased, but the water sources did not. The only three wells were drying up day by day. If one bucket of water could be drawn today, only half a bucket could be drawn the next day. The workers stipulated saving water in the patriotic pact, not taking baths, not washing quilts, and several people shared a basin of washing water, which was still saved and carried to the drilling rig. However, all these drops of water saved could not meet the needs of the drilling rig. Many times, the drilling rig had to be forced to stop drilling. In order to overcome this difficulty, the driver of the motor vehicle team, Liu Zhengting, drove a water truck to find water sources in the vast grassland. However, all the ditches found were covered with thick ice. Day after day, he drove the truck out and returned empty. Finally, he heard that there was a place called Warm Spring where the water did not freeze. He drove the truck and traveled more than forty miles on the snow to find this warm spring. Liu Zhengting jumped out of the car happily. However, the water pipe on the water truck was frozen and could not draw water. It would take a long time to use firewood to thaw the frozen water pipe, and he did not bring a single piece of firewood. He stood in the snow for a while, and found a yurt nearby. He walked over without hesitation, borrowed buckets from the Mongolians, and waded step by step into the stream to send water to the water truck. When the two-and-a-half-ton water truck was full, Liu Zhengting was exhausted, covered in sweat, and the water flowing into his shoes and pants had begun to freeze. He climbed into the car with difficulty. As the car drove towards the construction site, the telephone was urging him to send water to the drilling rig.

	Apprentice worker Fu Rang also kept thinking about a question: the country is strongly supporting our work, asking for anything and giving anything. New houses are being built one after another, and new workers are coming in batches. But what are we giving to the country? The country asks us to produce footage and core samples, but we have stopped drilling, there is no more footage, and no more core samples. Fu Rang remembered that he had quenched his thirst by melting snow when he was thirsty. Couldn't snow be melted for drilling? At first, no one paid attention to this suggestion. People didn't believe that snow water could supply the endless needs of the drilling rig. Fu Rang and another apprentice worker went to the grassland and dug a large bucket of snow, which melted into more than half a bucket of water after a while on the stove, one bucket after another. They melted seven large buckets of snow this day. Their drilling rig drilled in again. The news of this victory quickly spread to all the drilling rigs. From then on, "melting snow into water and starting the drilling rig" became the action slogan of all workers. In those days of heavy snow, the workers braved the severe cold, fell into the snow pits and climbed up again, transported the snow to the drilling rig room. When melting snow, the workers dug up the frozen earth, dug many pits, and let the snow water gather in the pits.

	The difficult winter of 1952 passed. 1953, the first year of the first Five-Year Plan, arrived. Geological workers and drilling workers from all over the country came to the grassland to participate in the work of Team 241. A huge physical prospecting team arrived, a laboratory was established, and new types of Soviet drilling rigs were erected one after another. More than a dozen water trucks continuously supplied water to the mountain day and night. Large trucks transported various equipment and all daily food and vegetables from cities more than three hundred miles away in a steady stream. Dozens of mule and horse carts continuously transported various building materials and mud for the drilling rig to the construction site. Auditoriums, offices, and dormitories were constantly being built. Cooperatives, bank offices, and post offices were successively established. Film teams, theater troupes, literary and art workers experiencing life, and news reporters, carrying the deep concern and respectful greetings of the people of the motherland, came to the grassland time and time again.

	The grassland is no longer "the sky is vast, the wilderness is boundless, and cattle and sheep are seen when the wind blows the grass low." On the green grassland, various benchmarks and small flags for geological exploration work are densely nailed. Tall drilling rig rooms are like many milestones recording the forward development of the motherland's construction cause. In the morning, as soon as the sheep wake up, the geological workers are already working on the grassland. In the evening, the stars no longer spend the long nights on the grassland alone. When the first star rises, all the drilling rig rooms, all the offices, all the dormitories, and street lights shine brightly. The evening wind no longer whispers alone, and the girls' songs overwhelm it. The girls sing:

	We work on the vast grassland,
	Far away from our hometown,
	To find the people's resources in that mysterious land. …

    草原上的故事
    ——中央地质部二四一队访问记之一
    范荣康
    这是一片无边无际的草原。草原上，没有村庄，没有一块被开垦过的土地。中央地质部二四一队在这里进行铁矿的勘探工作已经持续了三年多。不久的将来，一座新型的重工业城市将出现在这荒原上。
    三年多以前，这个草原的秘密尚未揭开，它和所有祖国北方的草原一样，一年中有半年多的时间被冰雪掩盖着，三两个蒙古姑娘在这儿牧放着羊群。一年又一年，羊儿们啃着青青的草丛，时时不知受了什么惊吓，互相拥挤着奔跑，又高又肥的牧羊犬警卫在羊群旁边，牧羊姑娘们站在群羊的后面，一动不动地凝望着草原的远方，默数着一个又一个逝去的年头。多少个年头过去了，草原上还是那样荒凉，经常出没着狼、蛇和像闪电一样在草原上奔窜的野兔，黄鼠在草地上挖成无数个洞穴，偶而还有大雕俯着身子在草原上掠过。这个地方，由于狼的猖狂，被人们称为“狼市口”。
    在这无止境的绿色的草原上，屹立着一座山。这座山就是今天被称为主矿的、二四一队进行勘探工作的主要地区，他们发现这里蕴藏着丰富的铁矿。可是，自古以来，草原上的人们就珍爱这座山，把它称为“宝山”。历代蒙古英雄们的尸骨都被埋葬在这座宝山上。陵墓里还埋藏着英雄们生前穿用的戎服、武器和各种纪念品。他们禁止任何人在这座宝山上搬动一草一石，惊动长眠的英雄。年年有蒙古人从四方奔来，举行定期的盛大的祀祷。
    一九五零年五月，中央人民政府派遣了地质工程师严坤元等以及以有二十年工龄的老钻探工人张建勋为首的二十个钻探工人，携带了一部钻机来到这草原上。护送地质勘探队来的还有一个蒙古骑兵连和一个步兵排（因为那时草原上还流窜着国民党匪军）。五月，正是美丽的初夏，长江南岸，百花怒放了，而草原还沉睡在茫茫的大雪中。这支祖国经济建设的先锋队，在这里找不到房子，找不到水，他们就架起蒙古包，淘掘了古井，把第一架钻机在主矿上安起来，探进草原的心脏。骑兵们在蒙古人民的协助下，歼灭了草原上的散匪。在这个战斗中，使地质勘探队和蒙古族人民结成牢不可破的友谊。
    草原上的短促的夏天逝去了，大雪和严寒紧跟着就要来到。按照原先的计划，这支地质勘探队伍是不准备在这里过冬的。可是，国家来了新的命令，要钻探工人坚持冬季工作，并且拨来了另一部钻机和另一批钻探工人。冬天的草原对初来这里的钻探工人说来，还是一个打不破的谜。没有谁能知道将寒冷到什么程度，没有谁能知道油料和水会不会结冰。就在这个时候，蒙古人民和当地的自治政府为地质勘探队提供了冬季气候的情况和作好保暖设备的各项意见。这一年的冬天，所有的水井都涂上马粪，盖起蒙古包，日以继夜地燃烧着烈火，不让井水冻住。也就在这一年冬天，草原上建成了第一幢房子。所有的工人都领到皮衣、皮帽、皮手套、皮靴，一切和严寒搏斗的设备都已准备就绪。钻探队就这样胜利地度过了第一个冬天。
    到了一九五二年的冬天，地质工作者所占有的资料，已可以判断过去日本帝国主义和其他的地质工作者对这里的铁矿蕴藏量的估计是多么保守，新的资料证明，这个铁矿的蕴藏量不是百分之几十，而是百分之几百地超过过去的估计。地质工作者不仅证明主矿是一个大的矿体，而且推断东矿的矿体露头可能也是一个相连的整体，这个推断在一九五一年就被物理探矿所证明。
    勘探工作在这些喜讯的鼓舞下继续进行。可是，就在这一年的冬天，遇到前所未有的困难。这一年的冬天，钻机增加了，而水源没有增加，仅有的三口水井一天天地枯竭下去，如果今天能够提上一桶水，第二天只能提上大半桶。工人们把节省用水订在爱国公约里，不洗澡、不洗被子，几个人合用了一盆洗脸水，还把它积存着，抬到钻机上去。可是，所有这些一点一滴节省下来的水都不能满足钻机的需要。有不少时候，钻机不得不被迫停止了钻进。为了克服这一困难，汽车队司机刘正庭驾驶着水车在茫茫的草原上寻找水源。可是，所有发现的水沟都结了厚厚的冰。他一天又一天，驾着车子出去，又空着车子回来。最后，他打听到有一个叫暖泉的地方，水是不结冰的。他开了车子，在雪地里走了四十多里路，发现了这个暖泉。刘正庭高兴地跳下车来。可是，水车上吸水的管子已经冻了，吸不上水。用柴火来烤开结了冻的水管需要很长的时间，而且没有带一根柴草。他站在雪地里愣了一阵，发现附近有一个蒙古包，他毫不犹豫地走过去，向蒙古人借了水桶，一步步地涉到水流中去，用水桶向水车上送水。两吨半的水车盛满水的时候，刘正庭已经精疲力尽，满身大汗，而流进他鞋子和裤子的水已开始冻结起来。他艰难地爬进车厢。当汽车驶向工地的时候，电话铃正催促着往钻机送水。
    学工傅让也不断地思索着一个问题：国家是大力支持着我们的工作，要什么，给什么。新的房子一幢幢地建成，新的工人一批批地来到。可是，我们给国家的是什么呢？国家要求我们拿出进尺和岩心，而我们停钻了，再也没有进尺，再也没有岩心。傅让想起了自己口渴的时候曾化雪解渴，难道就不能化雪钻进吗？起初，这个建议没有人重视，人们不相信雪水能供应钻机的无止境的需要。傅让就和另一个学工一起到草原上去挖了一大桶雪，放在火炉上一会儿就融成大半桶水，一桶接着一桶，这一天化了七大桶雪。他们的钻机重又钻进了。这个胜利的消息很快就传遍了所有的钻机。从此之后，“化雪为水，开动钻机”成为所有工人的行动口号。在那些大雪飘飘的日子里，工人们冒着严寒，跌倒在雪坑里又爬起来，把雪运到钻机房，化雪的时候，工人们掘开了冰冻的土地，挖成许多洞坑，让雪水聚结在坑里。
    困难的一九五二年的冬天过去了。一九五三年，第一个五年计划开始的第一年来到了。地质工作者、钻探工人从全国各地来到草原上，参加二四一队的工作。庞大的物理探矿队来到了，化验室建立了，各种新型的苏联钻机一部一部地架起来，十余部水车日夜不停地向山上供水，大卡车川流不息地从三百里以外的城市运来各种器材和所有一切日常食用的粮食和菜蔬，数十辆骡马大车不停地为工地送来各种建筑材料和钻机上用的泥浆，礼堂、办公室、宿舍不停地修建着，合作社、银行办事处、邮局相继成立，电影队、剧团、体验生活的文艺工作者、新闻记者，带着祖国人民深切的关怀和敬意的慰问团一次又一次来到草原上。
  草原上再不是“天苍苍，野茫茫，风吹草低见牛羊”了。绿色的草原上热闹地钉着各种地质勘探工作的基桩和小旗，一座座高高的钻机房，好像是许多记载着祖国建设事业向前发展的里程碑。早晨，羊儿刚刚醒来，地质工作者已经工作在草原上。晚上，星星不再是孤独地度过草原的长夜，当第一颗星儿升起的时候，所有的钻机房，所有的办公室，所有的宿舍和路灯都大放光明，晚风也不再孤独地低吟，姑娘们的歌声压倒了它。姑娘们唱着：
    我们工作在茫茫的草原，
    远离了自己的家乡，
    要在那神秘的大地里寻找人民的富源。……(附图片)
