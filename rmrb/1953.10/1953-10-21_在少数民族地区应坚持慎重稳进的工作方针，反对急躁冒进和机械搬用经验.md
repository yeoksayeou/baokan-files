    In Minority Areas, Adhere to a Cautious and Steady Work Approach, Oppose Impatience and Blindly Applying Experience
    Ma Jie
    China is a large multi-ethnic country with extremely complex ethnic situations. To do a good job in ethnic work, we must adopt a cautious and steady approach based on the specific circumstances of each ethnic group; especially for social reforms within minority ethnic groups—a process these groups must go through for development and progress—moreover, we must take appropriate steps to prevent impatience and rashness. To this end, the Party Central Committee has repeatedly emphasized the adherence to a cautious and steady work approach in its instructions to Party committees at all levels in relevant regions.
    Over the past four years, work in various minority areas across the country has basically been carried out in accordance with the cautious and steady approach, based on the characteristics and specific circumstances of each minority group, and with the voluntary participation of the majority of the people and leaders connected to the people in the region. Therefore, it has been warmly supported by the people of all ethnic groups and has achieved unprecedented unity among all ethnic groups in the country. However, based on the current situation, in many regions there are still practices of mechanically applying the experiences of the Han areas and rushing ahead impatiently, without regard for the characteristics and specific circumstances of the ethnic groups. Some comrades attempted to implement social reforms in pastoral areas, resulting in chaos. Some areas, when establishing ethnic autonomous regions, mechanically applied the set of methods used to organize peasant associations during land reform in the Han areas. In some minority areas, there are also practices of neglecting the production characteristics of minority ethnic groups and mechanically applying the experiences of the Han areas. For example, the Miao people in mountainous areas mainly produce coarse grains and need to plow and sow the land for coarse grains first in March and April each year, before plowing and sowing the land for rice, in order to sow coarse grains in time; however, some cadres insisted on using the methods of the plains areas, first ordering the plowing of land for rice, and some cadres even interfered with the masses' sowing of coarse grains. Such thoughts and practices of impatience and mechanically applying experience have invariably spoiled things and caused losses politically or in work. Why is it necessary to particularly emphasize a cautious and steady approach in ethnic work? Because:
    First, the ethnic situation in China is extremely complex. Minority ethnic groups differ from the Han in many aspects, such as economic life, language, writing, religious beliefs, and customs. Moreover, different minority ethnic groups often differ from each other, and even within a single minority group, the situations between different tribes, different religious sects, and agricultural and pastoral areas are often different or not entirely the same.
    Second, since liberation, although our country's ethnic groups have established a new relationship of equality, unity, mutual assistance, and friendship, factors hindering unity have not been completely eradicated. First, there is the sabotage from the enemy, namely the remnants of imperialism and its running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries—bandits, secret agents, and other counter-revolutionaries—instigating discord among various ethnic groups. They are constantly seeking gaps, using historical grievances existing between ethnic groups, as well as shortcomings and errors in our work, to instigate and incite, in order to undermine the unity of various ethnic groups and sabotage our great motherland. Especially the fraternal ethnic groups located on the borders of the motherland, who are frequently subjected to this threat. Secondly, there is the existence of Han chauvinism or remnants of Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism or remnants of narrow nationalism. Furthermore, within some minority ethnic groups, due to historical feuds, the instigation of counter-revolutionaries, and conflicts over specific interests, there are still phenomena of disunity.
    Third, the number of ethnic cadres still cannot keep up with the needs of the work. Han cadres sent to work in minority areas are not familiar with the local situation, and there are language barriers, resulting in many difficulties in contacting the masses, implementing the Party's policies, and implementing government orders.
    These situations determine that we must emphasize a cautious and steady approach in ethnic work. This approach is also necessary because if we do not do so, once we make mistakes in our work, it will be more difficult to recover political losses than in the Han areas.
    Of course, cautious and steady does not mean not advancing, but rather requires fully assessing the local ethnic situation and carrying out work based on the awareness of the broad masses. For example, regarding the issue of implementing social reforms in minority areas, we have always adopted a cautious and steady work approach, but this does not mean that we are not prepared to help the minority people carry out social reforms or that we will not do this kind of work. Appropriate reforms within ethnic groups are necessary, because this is a process that each group must go through to develop and progress and gradually reach the level of advanced ethnic groups. However, this kind of reform must be suited to the characteristics of its current stage of development, must be based on the will of the majority of the people of that ethnic group, and must take appropriate steps, relying on its own ethnic cadres to carry it out. The work experience in various minority areas over the past four years has proved that: Wherever the Party's policies are followed and a cautious and steady work approach is earnestly adhered to based on specific actual conditions, ethnic work has achieved great success, the ties between the Party and the masses have been strengthened, and the unity and cooperation between ethnic groups have been further consolidated and developed; at the same time, much experience has been accumulated. Conversely, in some areas where ethnic issues are not given enough attention, the situation is not understood, ethnic characteristics are ignored, and there is impatience and rushing ahead, mechanically applying the experiences of the Han areas, although the work in these areas has also achieved certain results, there are many errors and shortcomings, and the relationship of equality, unity, and mutual assistance between local ethnic groups has not been truly established.
    Impatience and blindly applying experience are both practices that do not proceed from reality and run counter to the Party's cautious and steady approach. The former proceeds from subjective desires, not appropriately postponing things that cannot be done today, but attempting to do things today that can only be done tomorrow, or even the day after tomorrow; not intending to help the minority peoples progress and develop gradually over a long period of time, but attempting to complete many things in a single morning. The latter proceeds from one's own narrow experience, often using the methods of the Han areas to deal with matters in minority areas with different situations; or mechanically applying the experience of one minority area to another minority area with different situations, resulting in spoiling things. Of course, correctly applying advanced experience based on the local ethnic situation and historical conditions is a necessary condition for the smooth development and progress of all ethnic groups. The practice of being complacent and refusing advanced experience is also wrong and must be prevented and corrected. In short, many cadres, due to insufficient understanding of the particularity, long-term nature, and complexity of ethnic work, and due to not investigating or studying, or rarely investigating and studying, the socio-economic situation of minority ethnic groups, often show serious subjective elements and one-sidedness in their work. They only see the smooth side of the work, neglecting the difficult side; only see the class relations side, neglecting the ethnic relations side; only see the active elements in the minority ethnic groups, neglecting the broad masses; only see or even exaggerate the side of the masses wanting to make progress, but neglect the side of the masses still being bound by many traditional backward influences; and even for the extremely complex religious issues with ethnic, mass, and historical characteristics, they neglect the many aspects of its penetration into the lives of the masses. As a result, it is naturally very easy to make mistakes.
    Comrade Stalin once pointed out the harm of impatience and blindly applying experience in ethnic work. He said: "That impetuousness displayed by some comrades in the sovietization of the borderlands—an impetuousness which often turns into crude clumsiness—is also a serious obstacle to the realization of Soviet autonomy. When these comrades, in areas that are a whole historical era behind Central Russia, in areas where medieval institutions have not yet been completely eliminated, are determined to make 'heroic efforts' to implement 'pure communism,' it can be confidently said that such cavalry-like attacks, such 'communism,' will not be of any benefit." (The Soviet Government's Policy on the National Question in Russia) He also said: "It is impossible and dangerous to transfer to the regions of these nationalities those methods which are effective and have significance in the center of Russia."
    (Report on the Immediate Tasks of the Party in the National Question at the Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)) Therefore, the emotions of impatience and the practice of mechanically applying experience in ethnic work must be resolutely opposed.
    In order to correct the errors of impatience and blindly applying experience, and to adhere to a cautious and steady work approach, based on the experience and practices of various regions in the process of rectification, the following suggestions are put forward:
    First, it is necessary to seriously criticize and overcome Han chauvinism. The subjectivism of impatience and blindly applying experience in ethnic work is often inseparable from the Han chauvinism or remnants of Han chauvinism existing in the ideological consciousness of some Han cadres. Criticizing Han chauvinism is conducive to overcoming subjectivism, bureaucracy, and the thoughts and behaviors of violating laws and regulations in ethnic work.
    Second, it is necessary to study and research Marxist-Leninist theory on the national question and the Party's ethnic policies. Marxist-Leninist theory on the national question is a guide for solving China's ethnic problems and has great practical significance for studying and solving China's ethnic problems and guiding our work. Therefore, by seriously studying and researching in connection with our own work, we can obtain inexhaustible instructions from the relevant works of Marxism-Leninism. At the same time, we must also earnestly study the various policies and documents of our Party on the national question. These policies and documents are formulated by the Party in accordance with the Marxist-Leninist theory on the national question and based on China's specific circumstances. Fully understanding the spirit of the Party's ethnic policies is essential to effectively overcome the shortcomings and errors of impatience and mechanically applying experience.
    Third, conduct systematic investigation and research work. Chairman Mao taught us: "Without investigation, there is no right to speak." The Party Central Committee's decision on investigation and research states: "Systematic and thorough social investigation is the basis for deciding policies." Currently, many new problems have been raised in ethnic work, all of which must rely on thorough and systematic investigation and research work to gradually solve.
    Fourth, establish and improve the work of Party committees at all levels and relevant departments of people's governments in managing minority areas. Party committees at all levels and relevant departments of people's governments should, based on needs, establish dedicated personnel or specialized institutions in their departments to manage this work, and in accordance with Article 31 of the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China": "The higher-level people's government should sufficiently estimate the characteristics and specific circumstances of the current stage of development of each ethnic autonomous region, so that its instructions and orders conform both to the general path of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and to such characteristics and specific circumstances," whenever work related to minority areas is carried out, when carrying out work deployments with a global scope and issuing decisions or decrees with a global scope, necessary explanations should be made according to the different circumstances of each minority ethnic group.
    Fifth, strengthening the unified leadership of Party committees, strictly implementing the system of asking for instructions and reporting, and overcoming the phenomena of disorganization, indiscipline, and decentralism is the main key to correctly grasping policies. Therefore, all issues related to policies and guidelines, as well as important plans and major matters, should be reported to the higher-level Party committee and the higher-level government in advance and implemented after approval.
    Sixth, regularly, with a focus, and from top to bottom, inspecting and summarizing work is an effective way to help leading bodies discover and solve problems and educate cadres. The inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies in various regions across the country that began last September has been of great help to cadre education. In particular, leading bodies above the county level have a relatively clear understanding of the basic policies and the erroneous thoughts and practices of impatience and mechanically applying experience, and there have been improvements in their work. However, some cadres in individual regions have not yet deeply understood the spirit of the Party's ethnic policies from this inspection and do not understand the importance of a cautious and steady approach. Therefore, in future work, leading bodies should help them study and analyze the specific situation and improve their policy thinking in order to do a good job in ethnic work.

    在少数民族地区应坚持慎重稳进的工作方针，反对急躁冒进和机械搬用经验
    马杰
    我国是一个多民族的大国，民族情况极端复杂，为了做好民族工作，必须根据各民族的具体情况，采取慎重稳进的方针；特别是对少数民族内部的社会改革——这种改革是少数民族发展进步中所必须经历的过程，更必须采取妥善步骤，防止急躁冒进。为此党中央在给各有关地区各级党委的指示中，曾一再强调坚持慎重稳进的工作方针。
    四年来，全国各少数民族地区的工作，基本上是按照慎重稳进的方针，根据各少数民族的特点和具体情况以及当地民族大多数人民和与人民有联系的领袖人物的自愿进行的，因而得到各族人民的热烈拥护，实现了全国各民族的空前大团结。但是，依据目前的情况看来，在不少地区还有不顾民族特点和具体情况而机械搬用汉族地区经验和急躁冒进的作法。有的同志曾企图在牧业区实行社会改革，结果引起牧业区的混乱。有的地区在建立民族自治区时搬用汉族地区土地改革中组织农会的一套办法。在某些少数民族地区也存在着忽视少数民族生产上的特点而机械搬用汉区经验的作法。如山区苗胞的生产以杂粮为主，每年三四月间需要先犁种杂粮的地，后犁种稻子的地，以便及时种杂粮；而有些干部却硬搬平原地区的办法，先叫犁种稻子的地，甚至有的干部还干涉群众种杂粮。诸如此类的急躁冒进和机械搬套经验的思想和作法，都无例外地把事情办坏了，在政治上或工作上造成了损失。为什么在少数民族工作中要特别强调慎重稳进的方针呢？因为：
    第一，我国民族情况是十分复杂的，少数民族在经济生活、语言文字、宗教信仰、风俗习惯等方面大都与汉族不同。而且各少数民族之间也往往互不相同，甚至一个少数民族内部的各部落间、各教派间、农业区与牧业区间，情况也多不相同或不完全相同。
    第二，解放以来，我国各民族虽已建立了民族平等、团结、互助、友爱的新关系，但妨碍团结的因素并没有完全根除。首先是从敌人方面来的破坏，即帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派的残余势力——土匪特务和其他反革命分子在各民族间的挑拨。他们无时不在寻找空隙，利用历史上遗留下来的存在于民族间的各种隔阂，以及我们工作中的缺点、错误，千方百计地进行挑拨、煽惑，来达到其破坏各民族的团结、破坏我们伟大祖国的目的。特别是处在祖国边疆的兄弟民族，经常地遭受到这种威胁。其次是大汉族主义思想或大汉族主义的思想残余和狭隘民族主义思想或狭隘民族主义思想残余的存在。再就是某些少数民族内部由于历史的仇隙，反革命分子的挑拨，以及某些具体利益的矛盾等原因，仍然存在着不团结的现象。
    第三，民族干部还赶不上工作的需要，派往少数民族地区工作的汉族干部，对当地情况不够熟悉，语言文字隔阂，因而在联系群众，贯彻党的政策，推行政令等各方面都存在着许多困难。
    以上这些情况，就决定了我们在民族工作中必须强调慎重稳进的方针。这个方针之所以必要，还由于如果不这样做，一旦在工作中犯了错误，要挽回政治上的损失较之在汉族地区更要困难。
    自然，慎重稳进并不是不进，而是要求必须充分估计当地民族的情况与依据广大群众的觉悟进行工作。例如关于少数民族地区实行社会改革问题，我们从来是采取慎重稳进的工作方针，但这并不是说我们不准备帮助少数民族人民进行社会改革，不去作这方面工作。各民族内部的适当改革是必要的，因为这是各民族发展进步、逐渐跻于先进民族水平所必需经历的过程。但这种改革必须适合其本民族当前发展阶段的特点，必须根据其本民族大多数人民的意志，并采取妥善步骤，依靠其本民族干部去进行。四年来在各少数民族地区的工作经验，都证明了：凡是根据党的政策，并从具体实际情况出发，认真地坚持了慎重稳进的工作方针的地区，民族工作就有很大的成就，密切了党和人民群众的联系，民族间的团结合作更加巩固和发展了；同时也积累了许多经验。反之，有些地区对民族问题不够重视，不了解情况，忽视民族特点，急躁冒进，在工作中机械搬用汉区经验，这些地区的工作虽然也有一定的成绩，但是错误缺点很多，当地民族间的平等、团结和互助的关系并未真正建立。
    急躁冒进和硬搬经验的作法，都是不从实际出发的，是和党的慎重稳进的方针背驰的。前者是从主观愿望出发，不是把今天还不能办的事予以适当推迟，而是企图把明天才能办的事，甚至是后天才能办的事，拿到今天来办；不是打算长期地、艰苦地、逐步地帮助少数民族人民进步和发展，而是企图在一个早上把许多事情都办完。而后者则是从自己狭隘的经验出发，往往以汉族地区的一套办法来对待情况不同的少数民族地区的事情；或将这一少数民族地区的经验，机械地搬用到另一情况不同的少数民族地区，结果把事情办坏。当然，依据当地民族情况和历史条件，正确地运用先进经验，是各民族顺利发展和进步的必要条件，那种故步自封，拒绝先进经验的做法也是错误的，也必须加以防止和纠正。总之，不少干部由于对民族工作的特殊性、长期性、复杂性认识不足，由于对少数民族的社会经济情况不调查、不研究或很少调查研究，往往在工作上表现了严重的主观成分和片面性。只看到工作顺利的一面，忽视困难的一面；只看到阶级关系的一面，忽视了民族关系的一面；只看到少数民族中积极分子的一面，忽视了广大群众的一面；只看到甚至夸大了群众要进步的一面，却忽视了群众尚被许多传统的落后影响所束缚的一面；甚至对具有民族性、群众性和历史性的极复杂的宗教问题，也忽视它的渗透群众生活的诸多方面。结果自然很容易犯错误。
    斯大林同志曾经指出在民族工作中急躁冒进和硬搬经验的危害性，他说：“有些同志在边疆苏维埃化上所表现的那种躁急情形——这种躁急往往转为粗暴的笨拙——也是实现苏维埃自治的一个严重的障碍。当这些同志在比中央俄罗斯落后一个整个历史时代的区域内，在尚未完全消灭中世纪机构的区域内，竟然决心为实行‘纯粹的共产主义’而作‘英勇的努力’的时候，可以自信地说，这种骑兵式的袭击，这种‘共产主义’是不会有好处的。”（苏维埃政权对俄国民族问题的政策）他又说：“把在俄罗斯中央有效力和有意义的办法，搬移到这些民族的区域里面来，那是不可能的，而且是危险的。”
    （在俄共（布）第十次代表大会上关于党在民族问题方面的迫切任务的报告）因此，民族工作中急躁冒进的情绪与机械搬用经验的作法是必须坚决反对的。
    为纠正急躁冒进和机械搬用经验的错误，坚持慎重稳进的工作方针，根据各地在改正过程中的经验和作法，提出如下几点意见：
    第一，必须严肃批判与克服大汉族主义思想。在民族工作上所表现出来的急躁冒进情绪和机械搬用经验的主观主义，往往是和一些汉族干部思想意识上存在的大汉族主义或大汉族主义思想残余分不开的。批判大汉族主义，就有利于克服民族工作中的主观主义、官僚主义和违法乱纪的思想和行为。
    第二，必须学习和研究马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的理论与党的民族政策。马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的理论是解决我国民族问题的指南，对研究和解决中国的民族问题，指导我们的工作有很大的现实意义。所以我们联系着自己的工作，认真地学习研究，就可以从马克思列宁主义的有关著作中，源源不竭地得到指示。同时也必须认真地学习我们党关于民族问题的各种政策和文件。这些政策和文件，是党按照马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的学说，根据我国的具体情况所制订出来的。充分领会党的民族政策的精神，才能有效地克服急躁冒进和机械搬用经验的缺点和错误。
    第三，进行系统的调查研究工作。毛主席教导我们说：“没有调查就没有发言权。”党中央关于调查研究的决定说：“系统的周密的社会调查是决定政策的基础。”当前民族工作中已提出了许多新的问题，都必须依靠周密的系统的调查研究工作，才能逐步解决。
    第四，建立与健全各级党委与各级人民政府有关部门管理少数民族地区工作的业务。各级党委与人民政府有关部门应依据需要在自己部门中设专人或建立专门机构管理这项工作，并根据中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要第三十一条：“上级人民政府应足够地估计各民族自治区当前发展阶段的特点和具体情况，使自己的指示、命令既符合于中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的总道路，又适合此种特点和具体情况”的规定，凡是有关少数民族地区的工作，在进行带全局性的工作部署与颁发带全局性的决定或法令时，应按照各少数民族的不同情况作必要的交代。
    第五，加强党委统一领导，严格执行请示报告制度，克服无组织无纪律现象和分散主义，这是正确掌握政策的主要关键。因此，凡有关政策、方针性的问题，以及重要计划、重大事项，都应事先报告上级党委和上级政府，经批准后再执行。
    第六，经常地、有重点地、自上而下地检查与总结工作，是帮助领导机关发现和解决问题、教育干部的有效办法。去年九月间开始的全国各地区民族政策执行情况的检查，对干部教育是很大的。特别是县以上的领导机关，对各项基本政策和急躁冒进与机械搬套经验的错误思想和作法，有了比较明确的认识，工作上有了改进。但个别地区有些干部还没有从这次检查中深刻领会党的民族政策的精神，还不懂得慎重稳进方针的重要性，因此，领导机关在今后工作中，应帮助他们研究分析具体情况，提高他们的政策思想，以做好民族工作。
