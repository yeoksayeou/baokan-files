Increased production and economy in Longshan Village, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, is continuing to deepen. The reason why the increased production and economy movement in this village can develop normally is mainly due to grasping the following four methods to conduct in-depth and popular propaganda: First, promoting key forces such as party members, Youth League members, and village cadres, and conducting door-to-door propaganda through various organizations such as the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and the People's Armed Forces, so that increased production and economy has become a household name in a short period of time. Second, holding small-scale symposiums for mutual aid team leaders, old peasants, women, and neighbors to educate the masses by the masses and concentrate the existing experience of the masses. For example, someone proposed the method of feeding pigs with beet leaves, which greatly saved miscellaneous grains. Third, seize typical groups of households for education. County and district cadres checked the harvested grain fields of a household with the surname Han and picked up seventy ears of grain in an area six tiao long wide and six gong long. According to this calculation, each hectare of land loses four dou of grain. Use such examples to educate the masses. Fourth, go deep into the groups and demonstrate typically. They seized the Shan Hongjun mutual aid team, reasonably organized manpower and animal power, adjusted the work of harvesting, pulling, and threshing, accelerated the speed, and built courtyard walls and laid mats when pulling crops to reduce losses. Then, the experience of this group was widely promoted. In the future, the village will strengthen the publicity and education of the worker-peasant alliance and national economic construction to further deepen the increased production and economy.

    黑龙江省绥化县龙山村增产节约宣传作到家喻户晓
    黑龙江省绥化县龙山村的增产节约正继续深入。该村增产节约运动所以能够正常发展，主要是抓紧以下四种方式，作深入人心的宣传：一、推动党员、团员以及村干部等骨干力量，并通过青年团、妇联会、人民武装各种组织进行挨门挨户的宣传，这样便使增产节约在短期作到了家喻户晓。二、召开互助组长、老农、妇女、同院等小型座谈会，以群众教育群众，并能集中群众已有经验。如有人提出以甜菜叶子喂猪的办法，大大节省了杂粮。三、抓住典型组户进行教育。县、区干部检查出韩打头的已割完的谷地，在六条垅宽六弓长的面积上，拣了七十个谷穗，如此推算，每垧地损失四斗粮。用这样的例子教育群众。四、深入小组，典型示范。他们抓住了单洪钧互助组，合理组织人力畜力，把割、拉、打的工作调剂好，加快了速度，并修筑场院墙、拉庄稼时铺席子，以减少损失。然后再把这个组的经验普遍推广。该村今后将加强工农联盟与国家经济建设的宣传教育，使增产节约继续深入。    （方青）
