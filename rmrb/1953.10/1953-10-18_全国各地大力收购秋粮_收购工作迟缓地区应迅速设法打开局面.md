    [This newspaper reports] National state-owned grain departments and cooperatives are vigorously carrying out the work of purchasing autumn grain. In September, the national purchase volume of rice, miscellaneous grains, soybeans, and wheat increased by 26.67 percent compared to the same period last year. However, the completion of the plan in various regions in September was very uneven. The Northeast region completed 108.54 percent of the plan, Inner Mongolia completed 232.99 percent, while the Northwest region only completed 45.98 percent.

    September is the season when grain is marketed in large quantities. In the South, the medium-season rice; in the North, soybeans and miscellaneous grains such as sorghum, corn, and millet; and in the Northeast, spring wheat have all generally entered the market. Wheat in North China, Northwest China and other places continues to be marketed. The national grain purchase volume in September increased by 28.04 percent compared to August, with rice increasing by 59.34 percent and miscellaneous grains increasing by 31.62 percent. In the Southwest region, the grain purchase volume in September increased by more than 120 percent compared to August.

    Before and after the large-scale marketing of autumn grain, many regions have taken effective measures to strengthen the autumn grain purchase work. The entire Central South region and the provinces of Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and others have successively held grain work conferences to study and vigorously carry out the autumn grain purchase work. The Southwest District Grain Administration and the Southwest District Office of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives jointly dispatched six inspection teams to various parts of Sichuan Province to inspect the purchase of grain and the supply of materials; financial departments at the special district and county levels in Sichuan, Yunnan, and other provinces also dispatched inspection teams to assist in the new grain purchase work in various places. In early September, the responsible persons of relevant units in the Wuhu Special District of Anhui Province inspected the grain purchase work in various counties. During September, the entire special district added 128 purchase stations. Counties actively solved the problem of storage capacity by strengthening transportation, building temporary warehouses, and renting private houses. At the same time, they further appropriately strengthened market management. The grain purchase work in the special district was relatively smooth in September, and the amount of grain marketed was quite large, reaching a maximum of 13 million jin per day.

    At present, the following shortcomings still exist in the grain purchase work in various regions: First, some regions have not done a good job in propaganda, and have not overcome some farmers' concerns about selling grain and their reluctance to sell. Second, some regions have insufficient supply of materials, and there are shortages of commodities. Third, some cadres have a sense of complacency. Some cadres in regions that have completed their plans well are blindly complacent, thinking they can relax. Some cadres in regions that have completed their plans poorly are losing confidence and working passively. In addition, the purchase methods in some areas are not convenient enough for farmers, some areas have problems such as insufficient storage capacity and funding disconnection, some areas do not manage the market well, some areas lack close cooperation between state-owned grain departments and cooperatives, and some cooperatives in some areas have relaxed their grain purchase work after cotton, native products, and specialties have been marketed. These shortcomings have, to varying degrees, affected the smooth progress of grain purchase work. All regions should quickly find ways to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings, especially regions where grain purchase work is progressing slowly, and should immediately take effective measures to open up the situation.

    全国各地大力收购秋粮
    收购工作迟缓地区应迅速设法打开局面
    【本报讯】全国各地国营粮食部门和合作社大力展开收购秋粮工作，九月份全国收购稻谷、杂粮、大豆、小麦的数量比去年同时期增加百分之二十六点六七。但九月份各地完成计划情况很不平衡，东北区完成计划百分之一百零八点五四，内蒙古完成计划百分之二百三十二点九九，西北区却只完成计划百分之四十五点九八。
    九月份是粮食大量上市的季节。南方的中稻，北方的大豆和高粱、玉米、谷子等杂粮，东北的春麦都已普遍登场。华北、西北等地的小麦也在继续上市。九月份全国收购粮食的数量比八月份增加了百分之二十八点零四，其中稻谷增加百分之五十九点三四，杂粮增加百分之三十一点六二。西南区九月份收购粮食数量比八月份增加了百分之一百二十以上。
    在秋粮大量上市前后，许多地区都采取有效措施，加强了秋粮收购工作。中南全区及河南、湖北、江西等省曾先后召开粮食工作会议，研究大力开展收购秋粮工作。西南区粮食管理局和中华全国合作社联合总社西南区办事处联合派出六个检查组，分赴四川省各地检查收购粮食和物资供应的情况；四川、云南等省专区、县各级财经部门也派出检查组协助各地进行新粮收购工作。安徽省芜湖专区各有关单位负责人在九月上旬到各县检查了购粮工作；全专区在九月间增设了一百二十八个收购站；各县都用加强调运、建造临时仓库、租借民房等办法积极解决仓容问题，同时进一步适当加强了市场管理。该专区九月份收购粮食工作开展比较顺利，粮食上市量相当大，最高时一天上市达一千三百万斤。
    目前，各地收购粮食工作中还存在着如下缺点：一、有些地区宣传工作作得不好，没有克服某些农民对售粮的顾虑和惜售思想。二、有些地区物资供应不足，有商品脱销现象。三、有些干部存在松气思想。完成计划较好的地区，有些干部盲目自满，认为可以松一口气；完成计划较差的地区，有些干部丧失信心，工作消极。另外，有的地区收购方法对农民还不够便利，有的地区有仓容不足、资金脱节等现象，有的地区对市场管理得不好，有的地区国营粮食部门和合作社配合不够密切，还有部分地区的合作社在棉花、土产、特产上市后放松了购粮工作。这些缺点都在一定程度上影响了购粮工作的顺利开展。各地应迅速设法克服上述各种缺点，特别是购粮工作进展迟缓的地区，应即采取有效措施打开局面。
