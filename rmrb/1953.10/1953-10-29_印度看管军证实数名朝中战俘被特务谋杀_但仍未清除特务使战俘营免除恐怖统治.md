Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 28th: The Indian Custodial Forces today, for the first time since taking over the custody of prisoners of war, confirmed that several Korean and Chinese POWs have been murdered by special agents of Syngman Rhee and the Kuomintang who control the camp.

The official press release issued by the Indian Custodial Forces today stated that one Korean POW was hanged, another was beaten to death, a third died of "starvation," and the fourth was a Chinese POW who was strangled to death. However, the news did not specify the causes of death, the time, or the camp numbers where the murders occurred.

The above situation is consistent with the accounts provided by returning Korean and Chinese prisoners of war regarding the reign of terror imposed by Syngman Rhee and Kuomintang special agents to prevent POWs from demanding repatriation. These returnees, upon arriving at Panmunjom from the POW camps, told the Neutral Nations Representatives and Indian officers about these circumstances.

Three weeks ago, Qian Shunkun, a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers, revealed at Panmunjom that Zhang Zilong, a POW in Camp No. 28, was executed by Kuomintang special agents who cut out his heart for expressing his desire for repatriation, shocking the neutral representatives present. Furthermore, Wang Xianzhang and Wang Xiang, two captured soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers who escaped from the custodial camp hospital and were sent back last Friday, cited the incident of a sick Chinese POW surnamed Zhang being beaten to death with wooden sticks by special agents on October 1st. They also confirmed that three Korean POWs were beaten to death by special agents in the hospital.

In order to enable the POWs to freely exercise their right to be repatriated, the Korean and Chinese sides immediately requested the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to conduct a thorough investigation into the atrocities committed by the Lee Chiang (Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek) agents in the POW camps and expressed their willingness to assist in providing witnesses, pointing out burial locations of the bodies, and identifying the murderers. However, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces have not yet taken action on this matter, nor have they made any efforts to free the POW camps from the reign of terror and ensure the POWs' right to be repatriated.

    印度看管军证实数名朝中战俘被特务谋杀
    但仍未清除特务使战俘营免除恐怖统治
    【新华社开城二十八日电】印度看管部队从接收看管战俘以来今天第一次证实有几个朝中战俘已被控制着营场的李承晚和国民党特务谋杀了。
    印度看管部队今天发表的官方新闻说，一个朝鲜战俘被绞死，另一个被砸死，第三个由于“饥饿”而死，第四个是中国战俘，他被缢死。然而该新闻并未说明死亡原因、时间及谋杀发生的营场的号码。
    上述情况与归来的朝中被俘人员所提供的关于李承晚、国民党特务为阻止战俘要求遣返施行恐怖统治的情况是相符合的。这些归来人员从战俘营一到板门店时，就把这些情形告诉了中立国代表以及印度军官。
    在三个星期以前，中国人民志愿军被俘人员钱顺坤就在板门店揭露了：二十八号营场的战俘张子龙因为表示要求遣返被国民党特务挖心处死，这使在场的中立国人员都大为震惊。另外两个从看管营医院逃出并在上星期五被送回来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员王宪章和王祥，又举出一名姓张的生病的中国籍战俘在十月一日被特务用木棍活活夹死的事件，他们并证实有三个朝鲜籍战俘在医院被特务打死。
    为了使战俘们能自由行使他们被遣返的权利，朝中方面立即要求中立国遣返委员会对李蒋特务在战俘营中的暴行进行彻底调查，并表示愿意在提供人证，在指出尸体埋葬地点和谋杀者等方面加以协助。然而中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队至今还没有就此事采取行动，也没有作任何努力，使战俘营免除恐怖统治，保证战俘有被遣返的权利。
