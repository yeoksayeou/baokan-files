Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: Vietnam News Agency reported on the 24th that the spokesperson of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army commented on the French colonialists' invasion of the liberated areas of Ninh Binh and Thanh Hoa provinces in mid-October. The spokesperson said that on October 15th, the French invading army gathered twelve mobile battalions, directly commanded by Navarre and Cogniet, the commander of French forces in North Vietnam, and launched an offensive against the southwest of Ninh Binh province with the support of artillery and aircraft. The French army also openly boasted that it would launch a large-scale offensive against Thanh Hoa.

On the morning of October 16th, about 400 enemy troops landed in some villages on the coast about 40 kilometers south of Thanh Hoa province. The landed enemy troops were repelled by local guerrillas that day and fled back to the sea. The enemy's landing in this area was to draw our regular troops to Thanh Hoa province in order to launch an offensive against the Nho Quan district of Ninh Binh province. However, contrary to the enemy's expectations, the Vietnamese People's Army did not move in this direction, but seized this opportunity to launch an offensive against the French army's weak rear positions, making them very embarrassed.

On the nights of October 18th and 19th, the People's Army attacked the flanks of the enemy advancing towards Ly Nhan, twelve kilometers southeast of Nho Quan, and annihilated four elite companies of the enemy.

At the same time, the People's Army took advantage of the exposed weaknesses in the enemy's rear to inflict devastating blows on the enemy in the Bui Chu area and Thai Binh province. On the night of the 18th, they annihilated the puppet army's 703rd and 707th light infantry battalions in Van Ly, south of Bui Chu, and seized all their weapons and ammunition. Thus, adding to the puppet army units annihilated earlier, the Vietnamese People's Army has so far annihilated two battalions and eleven companies of the newly formed puppet army light infantry battalions. This is a very heavy blow to the enemy's conspiracy to build a puppet army.

In Thai Binh province, People's Army units destroyed an enemy stronghold ten kilometers northwest of the capital of Thai Binh province on October 17th, annihilating two companies of the puppet army's 58th Battalion. The next day, they ambushed the Thai Binh-Hung Yen highway, annihilating two companies of the puppet army's 22nd Battalion.

Therefore, in the five days after the enemy began their futile incursions into southwestern Ninh Binh province, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated a total of fourteen companies of the enemy. The number of enemy casualties is equal to the number annihilated by the Vietnamese People's Army in the first phase of the autumn-winter offensive launched in the northwest in 1952.

The spokesperson then pointed out that the French colonialists shamelessly boasted that their troops had landed at Sam Son Port south of Thanh Hoa province, that their troops had advanced to places about 21 kilometers and 16 kilometers away from Thanh Hoa province, and that they had destroyed many important Vietnamese arms depots, all of which were fabricated.

The spokesperson said that in order to cover up their failures, Navarre and Cogniet will use all kinds of methods to obtain some "victories." They have not given up their attempt to invade Nho Quan, and may also attack Thanh Hoa. But the troops and people in these areas are ready to annihilate the enemy.

The spokesperson finally said that the French invading army, which is only concerned with advancing forward, has not had enough time to replenish their forces, and their rear is emptier than before. Therefore, the Vietnamese People's Army will seize this opportunity to annihilate the enemy's effective forces as much as possible, forcing Navarre and Cogniet, who want to gain military initiative, into a more passive position and suffer even more severe blows.

Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: According to Vietnam News Agency, in order to coordinate with the operations on the main battlefield in North Vietnam, eliminate enemy effectives, and expand the guerrilla zone, the People's Army units in South Vietnam actively launched offensives. In September, they killed 366 enemy troops, destroyed 9 enemy strongholds, sank and damaged one enemy gunboat each, and seized 110 various weapons and a large amount of military supplies.

In the Long-Chau-Sa area (i.e., Long Xuyen, Chau Doc, and Sa Dec provinces), the People's Army local forces eliminated three enemy strongholds in Lai Dung, Can Nhut, and Doc Du during the first twenty days of September.

In the Gia Dinh and Tay Ninh areas, the People's Army repelled the French army's "sweep" in Zhou Thanh County in mid-September, killing 126 enemy troops. A few days later, the People's Army repelled the enemy's second "sweep" by seven battalions, killing and wounding many enemy troops, and forcing 25 puppet soldiers to surrender. At the same time, the People's Army sank and damaged one enemy gunboat each in Cai Be District of My Tho Province.

    越南人民军总部发言人评论越南最近战局
    人民军正乘虚袭击敌军后方并截击进犯宁平清化之敌
    【新华社二十七日讯】据越南通讯社二十四日讯：越南人民军总司令部发言人就法国殖民者在十月中旬向宁平省和清化省解放区进犯一事发表评论。发言人说，在十月十五日，法国侵略军纠集了十二个机动营，由纳瓦尔和北越法军司令戈涅直接指挥，在大炮和飞机的支援下向宁平省西南进犯。法军并公开吹嘘要向清化发动一次大规模进攻。
    十月十六日早晨，约有四百名敌军在清化省会以南四十公里左右的海岸的一些村庄登陆。登陆的敌军当天就被当地游击队击退，逃回海面去。敌军在这个地区登陆是为了把我们的正规部队吸引到清化省，以便对宁平省儒关府发动进攻。但是和敌军所料想的相反，越南人民军并没有向这个方向移动，反而抓住这个机会对法军后方脆弱的据点发动进攻，使他们非常狼狈。
    十月十八日和十九日夜晚，人民军袭击了向儒关府东南十二公里的里亚推进的敌军侧翼，歼灭了敌军四个精锐连。
    人民军同时利用敌军后方暴露的弱点，给予裴朱地区和太平省的敌军以歼灭性的打击。十八日晚在裴朱以南的文里歼灭伪军第七零三和第七零七轻装营，缴获了他们的全部武器和弹药。这样，加上以前歼灭的伪军部队，越南人民军到现在为止已经歼灭了新成立的伪军轻装营的两个营和十一个连。这是对敌人建立伪军的阴谋的一个非常沉重的打击。
    在太平省，人民军部队在十月十七日摧毁了敌军在太平省省会西北十公里的一个据点，歼灭伪军第五十八营的两个连。第二天又在太平—兴安公路上进行伏击，歼灭伪军第二十二营的两个连。
    因此，在敌人对宁平省西南部开始进行徒然的窜犯后的五天中，越南人民军一共歼灭了敌军十四个连。敌军伤亡人数等于一九五二年在西北部发动的秋—冬攻势第一个阶段中被越南人民军所歼灭的人数。
    发言人接着指出：法国殖民者无耻地吹嘘他们的部队已经在清化省会以南的参山港登陆，他们的部队已经进抵离清化省会约二十一公里和十六公里的地方，以及他们已毁坏了许多越南的重要军火库等情事，完全是捏造的。
    发言人说：为了要掩饰他们的失败，纳瓦尔和戈涅将会用各种办法来取得一些“胜利”。他们还没有放弃向儒关府进犯的企图，并且可能要进攻清化。但是在这些地区的军队和人民已经做好了歼灭敌人的准备。
    发言人最后说：只顾向前进攻的法国侵略军还没有充分的时间来补充他们的兵力，而且他们的后方比以前更加空虚。因此，越南人民军将抓紧这个机会，尽量歼灭敌人的有生力量，迫使想取得军事主动权的纳瓦尔和戈涅处于更加被动的地位，并遭受更加惨重的打击。
    【新华社二十七日讯】据越南通讯社讯：南越人民军部队为了配合北越主要战线的作战，消灭敌人有生力量和扩大游击区，积极主动出击，在九月份共打死敌军三百六十六名，摧毁敌军据点九处，击沉和击伤敌人炮艇各一艘；缴获各种武器一百一十件和大量军用物资。
    在龙—朱—沙地区（即龙川、朱笃、沙沥三省），人民军地方部队在九月的头二十天中拔除了莱蓉、芹育和笃预的敌军据点三处。
    在嘉定、西宁地区，人民军在九月月中击退了法军在周盛县的“扫荡”，打死敌军一百二十六名。数天后，人民军又击退了敌军七个营的第二次
    “扫荡”，杀伤许多敌军，并迫使二十五名伪军投诚。同时，人民军在美萩省的丐?县曾击沉和击伤敌军炮艇各一艘。
