    The Wuhan Municipal Increase Production and Practice Economy Inspection Committee held a meeting on October 13th, deciding to further develop the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in Wuhan's private industrial and commercial sectors during the fourth quarter. More than 30 people attended the meeting, including leaders from the Municipal People's Government, the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee.

    The meeting initially summarized the production and operation of Wuhan's private enterprises over the past year. It was considered that under the leadership of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Wuhan Municipal People's Government, launching the broad masses of workers to carry out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement under the principle of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital has achieved great success. After carrying out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, the output of many private factories has increased by about 30 to 50 percent compared to a year ago. Among them, some private enterprises, like Yizhong Knitting Factory, currently have an output increase of about 70 percent compared to last November, and the rate of defective products has also dropped from 30 percent to 8 percent. In the past, many private factories had products that were "not good in quality and not cheap in price," but they have largely improved their quality in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement.

    In the process of carrying out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, the grassroots organizations of the Party, the Youth League, and the trade unions in many private enterprises in Wuhan have also grown stronger along with the development of production. Over the past year, more than 1,000 worker activists in private enterprises have joined the Communist Party, and more than 3,000 have joined the Youth League. They have played an important role in private enterprises. Many capitalists have also gained confidence in their operations due to their personal experience of the benefits of the People's Government's policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital. A year ago, the owner of a factory in Wuchang was negative about business, but now he has improved his business management and is actively producing.

    The meeting analyzed that because the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement has not yet been universally carried out in all private enterprises in the city, it has recently been discovered that some capitalists are cutting corners and evading taxes quite seriously. Therefore, in the fourth quarter, it is necessary to continue to deepen the city-wide Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement in private industry and commerce to ensure the state's processing orders and state tax revenue; to further strengthen the work of the grassroots trade union organizations and the Party and Youth League in private enterprises; and to appropriately improve workers' living welfare on the basis of developing production. The meeting emphasized: all manufacturers must ensure the quality of state processing orders, deliver goods on time, not cut corners, not inflate costs, and constantly pay attention to improving quality and reducing costs. The central task of private commerce is to prevent speculation and hoarding, raise prices and other behaviors, establish new business ethics, and ensure the completion of tax payment tasks in accordance with state tax rates. Workers should ensure quality, improve technology, help capitalists improve production, and report illegal acts of capitalists. At the same time, state-owned commerce should continue to gradually strengthen the planning of processing orders. Private handicrafts should further improve labor-capital, employment, and apprenticeship relations, and change the phenomenon of rough manufacturing and high prices.

    武汉市私营工商业进一步开展增产节约运动
    武汉市增产节约检查委员会在十月十三日举行会议，决定第四季度在武汉市私营工商业中进一步开展增产节约运动。出席会议的有市人民政府、市工商业联合会、市财政经济委员会等单位的负责人三十余人。
    会议初步总结了一年来武汉市私营企业生产经营的情况，认为在中国共产党武汉市委员会和武汉市人民政府领导下，发动广大职工，在发展生产、劳资两利的原则下开展增产节约运动已获得很大成绩。许多私营工厂开展增产节约运动后，比一年以前的产量约提高了百分之三十到五十。其中有些私营企业像一中针织厂，目前的产量约比去年十一月份增加百分之七十，次货率也由百分之三十降到百分之八。过去许多私营工厂“货不美、价不廉”的产品，也大都在增产节约运动中提高了质量。
    在开展增产节约运动中，武汉市许多私营企业中的党、团和工会基层组织也随着生产的发展而壮大起来。一年来私营企业中的职工积极分子已有一千多人参加了共产党，三千多人参加了青年团，他们在私营企业中起了重要的作用。许多资本家由于亲身体验到人民政府发展生产、劳资两利政策的好处，经营的信心也有了提高。一年前，武昌有一家工厂的老板经营消极，现已改善经营管理，积极生产了。
    会议分析了由于增产节约运动还没有在全市私营企业中普遍开展起来，近来已发现某些资本家偷工减料、偷税漏税相当严重。因此，第四季度中就必须继续深入开展全市私营工商业增产节约运动，以保证国家加工定货和国家税收任务；进一步加强私营企业中工会基层组织和党、团的工作，并在发展生产的基础上，适当改善工人生活福利。会议强调指出：各厂商必须保证国家加工定货的质量，按期交货，不偷工减料，不浮报成本，并经常注意改进质量，降低成本。私营商业的中心工作在于防止投机倒把，抬高物价等行为，树立新的商业道德，保证按照国家税率，完成纳税任务。工人应该保证质量，提高技术，并帮助资方搞好生产，检举资方的不法行为。与此同时，国营商业应继续逐步加强加工定货的计划性。私营手工业应进一步搞好劳资、雇佣和师徒关系，改变粗制滥造和价格偏高的现象。    （新华社）
