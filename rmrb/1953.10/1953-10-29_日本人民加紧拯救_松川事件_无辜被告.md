Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th: As the date of the second trial verdict of the "Matsukawa Incident" frame-up case – November 5th – draws nearer, the people of Japan are intensifying their rescue movement, resolutely demanding that all innocent defendants be declared not guilty and have their freedom restored.

    The rescue movement is particularly high in the Tohoku region (northern Honshu). Sendai City, where the Sendai High Court which is trying the "Matsukawa Incident" is located, is in this region. On the 24th, a Tohoku regional conference "Demanding a Fair Trial for the Matsukawa Incident and Upholding Freedom and Human Rights" was held in Sendai City. This conference was prepared for a long time by the "Matsukawa Incident" Tohoku Regional Countermeasures Council, the Miyagi Prefecture Branch of the Japan National Relief Association, and trade union organizations from six prefectures in the Tohoku region, including Miyagi and Yamagata, and was sponsored by Japan National Relief Association advisor, Councilor Jiichiro Matsumoto, and others. More than 2,000 representatives from various people's organizations and people from all walks of life participated in the conference. The conference received more than 110 telegrams of encouragement from all over the country. Speakers at the meeting pointed out that the "Matsukawa Incident" was a frame-up case created by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to suppress the Japanese people and demanded a fair trial. The conference unanimously adopted a resolution demanding the release of all defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident."

    The movement to demand the release of the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" is also developing further in other parts of Japan. The Niigata Prefecture Branch of the Japan Teachers' Union has launched a campaign to collect signatures and raise relief funds to demand the release of all innocent defendants. The Tokyo Chuo Ward Trade Union Council also resolved on the 7th to demand a fair trial for the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" and to launch a signature campaign and raise relief funds to demand the release of all defendants.

    Since mid-September, the families of the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" and the defendants who were released on bail due to illness have launched a complaint movement in Kyushu, Kansai, Kanto, Hokuriku, and Hokkaido, allowing more people from all walks of life in Japan to understand the truth of the "Matsukawa Incident" created by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. On November 4th, the day before the second trial verdict of the "Matsukawa Incident," people from all walks of life in Japan will hold a national conference in Sendai City demanding the release of all innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident."

    Under the continuous exposure by the Japanese people, the fabricated and framed nature of the "Matsukawa Incident" has become increasingly difficult to conceal. The Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Yomiuri Shimbun" recently admitted that the original verdict of the "Matsukawa Incident" was untenable. On October 6th, the newspaper published a news item on the first page with the headline "Doubts that Make the Original Verdict of the Matsukawa Incident Untenable," in which it admitted that there were many flaws in the "evidence" that served as the basis for the first instance verdict. The newspaper also said: All this "proves the incompleteness of the first instance, and now the original verdict is untenable."

    日本人民加紧拯救“松川事件”无辜被告
    【新华社二十八日讯】东京消息：在“松川事件”诬害案第二审宣判日——十一月五日——一天天临近的时候，日本各地人民正在加紧展开救援运动，坚决要求宣布全体无辜被告无罪，恢复他们的自由。
    救援运动在东北地方（本州北部）特别高涨。审判“松川事件”的仙台高等裁判所所在地仙台市就在这个地区内。二十四日，在仙台市举行了东北地方“要求公正审判松川事件、维护自由与人权”的大会。这个大会由“松川事件”东北地方对策协议会、日本国民救援会宫城县分会和东北地方的宫城、山形等六个县的工会组织进行了长时间的筹备工作，并得到日本国民救援会顾问、参议员松本治一郎等人的赞助。参加大会的有各人民团体的代表和各阶层人民共二千多人。大会接到来自全国各地的鼓励电报达一百数十件。会上的发言者指出，“松川事件”是美、日反动派为了镇压日本人民而制造的诬害案，并要求公正的审判。大会一致通过决议，要求释放“松川事件”全体被告。
    要求释放“松川事件”被告的运动也在日本其他地方进一步发展。日本教职员工会新澙县分会发起了要求释放全体无辜被告的签名和募集救援金运动。东京中央区工会协议会在七日也决议要求公正审判“松川事件”被告、展开要求释放全体被告的签名运动和募集救援金。
    “松川事件”被告的家属和因病保释出狱的被告，自九月中旬以来即分别在九州、关西、关东、北陆以及北海道等地方，展开控诉运动，使更多的日本各界人民都明了了美、日反动派制造“松川事件”的真象。在“松川事件”第二审宣判的前一天——十一月四日，日本各界人民将在仙台市举行要求释放“松川事件”全体无辜被告的全国大会。
    在日本人民不断的揭露下，“松川事件”的捏造和诬陷性质已越来越难以掩盖。日本资产阶级报纸“读卖新闻”最近也承认“松川事件”的原判是站不住脚的。十月六日，该报在第一版头一栏上以“使松川事件原判站不住脚的疑窦”为题发表了一条新闻，其中承认：作为第一审判决的根据的“证据”，有着许多的破绽。该报并且说：这一切都“证明第一审的不完备，现在原判要站不住脚了”。
