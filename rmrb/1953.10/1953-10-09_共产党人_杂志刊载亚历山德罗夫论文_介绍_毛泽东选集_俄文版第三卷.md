Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th: The 14th issue of the magazine "Communist" published an article by A. Alexandrov, introducing the Russian edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume III. (Note: The Russian edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume III is the second half of the Chinese edition, Volume II, which includes Chairman Mao's papers, speeches, and other works published from May 1939 to May 1941.)

In his article, Alexandrov introduced the international and domestic environment at the time of publication of Chairman Mao's works collected in this volume, as well as the situation of the War of Resistance Against Japan at that time. He pointed out that, based on a scientific analysis of these objective circumstances, Comrade Mao Zedong elaborated in detail the characteristics of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan and the tasks and policies of the Chinese revolution, and stipulated the policies and strategies of the Chinese Communist Party on various issues. Alexandrov wrote: "The Russian edition of 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong,' Volume III, includes rich material illustrating the struggle of the Chinese Communists for the victory of Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and principles. Comrade Mao Zedong's works prove that the Chinese Communist Party creatively developed this theory and applied it in the national liberation struggle of the Chinese people."

Alexandrov introduced in detail the article "'Foreword' to 'The Communist.'" He said: Comrade Mao Zedong's article has great theoretical value. In this article, Comrade Mao Zedong analyzed the specific environment and characteristics of the historical development of the Chinese revolution, and played a significant role in overcoming the shortcomings in the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. This article pointed out a clear line for consolidating the Party organizationally and ideologically.

Alexandrov then wrote: Under the extremely difficult conditions of a long period of armed struggle, the Chinese Communist Party formulated and successfully implemented a flexible and clear political line and strategy and tactics for the Chinese people's war of liberation against Japanese imperialism. At the same time, the Chinese Communist Party also formulated a program for building a New China. Alexandrov analyzed Chairman Mao's "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "On New Democracy." He said that in these two works, Comrade Mao Zedong formulated a profound program for building a New China.

Alexandrov then introduced the two articles "The Identity of Soviet Interests and the Interests of Humanity" and "Stalin is a Friend of the Chinese People." He said that in these two articles, Comrade Mao Zedong developed the idea of strengthening the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and pointed out that the sincere, selfless, brotherly friendship and assistance of the Soviet Union is a powerful international condition for ensuring the victory of the Chinese people's liberation struggle and the struggle against the enemy. Alexandrov said that life has confirmed the complete correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's argument on Sino-Soviet friendship.

Alexandrov concluded by writing: Comrade Mao Zedong's works profoundly and clearly expound on all aspects of the social life and heroic struggle of our friends—the great Chinese people and the fraternal party—the Chinese Communist Party. These works are examples of the creative study of Marxism, examples of linking Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory with the practice of the Chinese people's liberation struggle, and with the activities of the Communist Party of one of the world's largest countries. In these works, there are important theoretical summaries and concrete analyses of the general and individual problems of the Chinese revolution, of national democratic construction, and of the policies and practical activities of the Chinese Communist Party. Comrade Mao Zedong's works have great theoretical and practical significance for the national liberation and communist movements of all countries.

    “共产党人”杂志刊载亚历山德罗夫论文
    介绍“毛泽东选集”俄文版第三卷
    【新华社莫斯科八日电】“共产党人”杂志第十四期刊载了阿·亚历山德罗夫的一篇论文，介绍“毛泽东选集”俄文版第三卷。（按：“毛泽东选集”俄文版第三卷是中文版第二卷的后半部，其中包括毛主席从一九三九年五月到一九四一年五月期间所发表的论文、演说和其他著作。）
    亚历山德罗夫在文章中介绍了该卷所收集的毛主席的著作在当时发表时的国际和国内环境，以及当时抗日战争的形势。他指出：根据对这些客观环境的科学分析，毛泽东同志详尽地论证了中国人民抗日战争的特点和中国革命的方针任务，并规定了中国共产党在各种问题上的政策和策略。亚历山德罗夫写道：“毛泽东选集”俄文版第三卷包括了说明中国共产党人为马克思列宁主义革命理论和原则的胜利而进行的斗争的丰富材料。毛泽东同志的著作证明了中国共产党创造性地发展了这个理论，并在中国人民的民族解放斗争中运用了这个理论。
    亚历山德罗夫详细介绍了“‘共产党人’发刊词”一文。他说：毛泽东同志的这篇文章有着巨大的理论价值。毛泽东同志在这篇文章中分析了中国革命的历史发展过程的具体环境和特点，在克服中国共产党建党中的缺点方面起了重大的作用。这篇文章指出了从组织上、思想上巩固党的明确的路线。
    亚历山德罗夫接着写道：中国共产党在长期的武装斗争的极端困难的条件下，制订了并成功地实现了中国人民反抗日本帝国主义的解放战争的灵活的、明确的政治路线及战略和策略。和这同时，中国共产党还制订了建设新中国的纲领。亚历山德罗夫分析了毛主席的“中国革命和中国共产党”和“新民主主义论”。他说，在这两部著作中，毛泽东同志拟定了深刻的建设新中国的纲领。
    亚历山德罗夫接着介绍了“苏联利益和人类利益的一致”和“斯大林是中国人民的朋友”两篇文章。他说，在这两篇文章中，毛泽东同志发展了加强中国与苏联友谊的思想，指明苏联的真诚无私的兄弟般的友谊和帮助，是保证中国人民解放斗争和对敌斗争胜利的强大的国际条件。亚历山德罗夫说，生活证实了毛泽东同志关于中、苏友谊的论断的全部正确性。
    亚历山德罗夫最后写道：毛泽东同志的著作，深刻而明确地阐明了我们的朋友——伟大的中国人民和兄弟党——中国共产党在社会生活和英勇的斗争中各方面的问题。这些著作是创造性地研究马克思主义的范例，是把马克思列宁主义革命理论和中国人民解放斗争实际联系、和世界上最大国家之一的共产党的活动联系起来的范例。在这些著作中，有中国革命总问题和个别问题的、有国家民主建设的、有中国共产党政策和实际活动的重要的理论总结和具体分析。毛泽东同志的著作，对于所有国家的民族解放和共产主义运动，在理论上和实际上都有着很大的意义。
