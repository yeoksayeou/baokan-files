Severe Tax Evasion by Private Industrial and Commercial Businesses Across the Country

Tax evasion by private industrial and commercial businesses is rampant across the country, and some regions have begun self-reporting and supplementary payment efforts.

The tax evasion situation of private industrial and commercial businesses in major cities across the country is as follows: Since May of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Taxation Bureau has sampled 2,758 self-declared accounts and discovered that 2,347 households had varying degrees of tax evasion. The recently launched self-reporting and supplementary payment efforts have further proven that tax evasion among those whose taxes were assessed by public appraisal is also quite serious. For example, the Changshu District Taxation Sub-bureau sampled 69 households whose taxes were assessed by public appraisal and found that 67 households had tax evasion problems. They use a wide variety of tax evasion methods; according to Shanghai statistics, there are as many as 77 types. The circumstances of some tax evaders are very egregious. For example, a Shanghai machinery factory reported a loss of 6.9 billion yuan despite having a surplus of 3.4 billion yuan. The Desen Chang Umbrella Shop in Songshan District has consistently evaded taxes by issuing invoices with "large heads and small tails"; for one transaction worth 1.6 million yuan, the invoice stub only showed 2,000 yuan. Another example is the Anfeng Coal Company on Changsha Road in the city, which evaded taxes by forging seals, falsifying documents, and falsely listing procurement commissions. It even falsely reported sales discounts and incited other businesses to forge sales discount vouchers, evading over 21 million yuan in income tax. Despite repeated education from the tax authorities, it still attempted to quibble. It has now been transferred to the People's Court for handling and has been severely punished. Similarly, in Tianjin, the Municipal Taxation Bureau inspected 742 industrial and commercial households in April and May of this year, and 529 households were found to have engaged in tax evasion. In Wuhan, the Municipal Taxation Bureau inspected some industrial and commercial households in July and August and discovered that 440 households had engaged in tax evasion, with a preliminary finding of over 1.1 billion yuan in tax evasion. In Beijing, the Municipal Taxation Bureau inspected 3,034 households in the second quarter of this year and found that 1,202 households had engaged in tax evasion, totaling over 1.1 billion yuan in tax evasion. In Guangzhou, the Municipal Taxation Bureau discovered 118 households engaged in tax evasion during the 1952 income tax final settlement review, evading over 60 million yuan in business tax, over 1.12 billion yuan in income tax, and over 7 million yuan in other taxes.

The situation of tax evasion by private industrial and commercial businesses in small and medium-sized cities across the country is also quite common. For example, the Changsha Municipal Taxation Bureau in Hunan Province investigated 188 households in August and found that unreported income amounted to over 1.12 billion yuan. According to a survey by the Provincial Taxation Bureau in Jiangxi Province, the average unreported turnover of five industries in Ji'an County was 31 percent, with the highest being 51 percent and the lowest being 18 percent. The Wuxi Municipal Taxation Bureau in Jiangsu Province investigated 171 households and found that 120 households had engaged in tax evasion. One cloth factory alone failed to report a turnover of over 230 million yuan. Some industrial and commercial households consistently evade taxes and do not repent after repeated education. For example, Pan Jiyuan, the person in charge of the Wantai Fu Native Tobacco Floss Shop in Suzhou, privately sold a batch of native tobacco floss without paying commodity tax in November 1952. After the tax bureau discovered this, he was treated leniently, given education, and made to pay the tax and exempt from penalty. In July of this year, the tax bureau discovered that the shop had again privately sold over 700 jin of untaxed tobacco floss. After the city launched the "rectify tax discipline" campaign, the shop again privately sold 200 jin of untaxed native tobacco floss, and consistently defaulted on tax payments and resisted paying. When tax cadres provided education, his attitude was consistently arrogant. The Suzhou Municipal People's Court has already sentenced the merchant to imprisonment. The Hangzhou Municipal Taxation Bureau in Zhejiang Province investigated 2,800 households and found that more than 2,000 households had engaged in tax evasion. The situation of tax evasion in Shandong Province is also quite serious. A company in Qingdao, for example, evaded over 149 million yuan in income tax. Other cities in the Northeast region such as Anshan, Benxi, and Chengde, and the Linfen County Taxation Bureau in Shanxi Province in the North China region have also uncovered many tax evasion cases.

The tax evasion behavior of these illegal industrial and commercial households has attracted the attention of party and government leading organs and tax authorities in various regions. Workers and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have also called on the government to take effective measures to stop it. Some regions have already launched self-reporting and supplementary payment efforts, while others have begun to rectify tax discipline. Tax authorities in various regions, under the leadership and assistance of local party and government organs and the broad masses of workers and shop assistants, are resolutely fighting against tax evasion.

    各地私营工商业偷税漏税现象严重
    全国各地私营工商业者偷税漏税现象严重，部分地区已开展自查补报工作。
    全国各大城市私营工商业者的偷漏税情况是：上海市税务局自今年五月份起抽查了二千七百五十八家自报查账户，发现有二千三百四十七户有不同程度的偷税漏税行为。在最近开展自查补报工作中，进一步证明了民评户偷税漏税情况也相当严重。如常熟区税务分局抽查了六十九家民评户，发现六十七户有偷税漏税的问题。他们偷税漏税的花样非常多，据上海统计，竟达七十七种。有些偷税漏税户的情况非常恶劣，如上海一机器厂盈余三十四亿元，竟报亏损六十九亿元；嵩山区德森昌伞店，一贯以开发货票“大头小尾”的方式进行偷税，有一笔生意卖了一百六十万元，在发货票存根上仅开了二千元。又如该市长沙路安丰煤号，竟采取私刻图章、伪造单据、虚列进货佣金等方式进行偷税。其中伪报销货折让并唆使其他商户伪造销货折让凭证一纸，即偷漏所得税二千一百余万元。虽经税务机关屡次教育，仍然企图狡赖，现已移送人民法院处理，并受到严厉的惩处。又如天津市税务局在今年四、五月间检查的七百四十二户工商业户中有偷漏税行为的达五百二十九户。武汉市税务局在七、八月份对部分工商业户进行检查的结果，发现四百四十户有偷漏税行为，初步发现偷漏税额达十一亿余元。北京市税务局今年第二季度检查三千零三十四户的结果，发现有偷漏税行为的达一千二百零二户，共偷漏税款达十一亿余元。广州市税务局在一九五二年度所得税汇算清交覆查工作当中，查获一百一十八户有偷税漏税行为，偷漏营业税六千余万元，所得税十一亿二千余万元，其他各税七百余万元。
    全国各地中小城市私营工商业者偷税漏税的情况也是相当普遍的。如湖南省长沙市税务局八月份调查了一百八十八户，发现漏报所得额达十一亿二千余万元。江西省据省税务局调查，吉安县五个行业漏报营业额平均为百分之三十一，最高的达百分之五十一，最低的也达百分之十八。江苏省无锡市税务局调查了一百七十一户，发现有一百二十户有偷税漏税行为，某布厂一家漏报营业额即达二亿三千余万元。有些工商业户一贯地偷税，屡经教育并不悔改，如苏州市万泰福土烟丝号负责人潘积元，在一九五二年十一月间私售未纳货物税的土烟丝一批，经税务局查获后，从宽处理，给予教育，补税免罚。今年七月税务局又查获该号私售未纳税的烟丝七百余斤，在该市开展“整饬纳税纪律”工作后，该号又私售未纳税的土烟丝二百斤，并一贯拖欠税款抗拒不缴，税务干部给予教育时，态度始终蛮横，现苏州市人民法院已经对该商判处徒刑。浙江省杭州市税务局调查了二千八百户，有偷税漏税行为的就在二千户以上。山东省偷税漏税的情况也相当严重，其中偷税问题较大的如青岛市某公司偷漏所得税额达一亿四千九百余万元。其他东北区鞍山、本溪、承德等市和华北区山西的临汾县税务局都查获了不少的偷税漏税案件。
    这些不法工商业户的偷税漏税的行为，已引起各地党、政领导机关和税务机关的重视。各地工人群众与工商联也纷纷要求政府采取有效方法加以制止。现在有些地区已经展开自查补报工作，有些地区已开始整顿纳税纪律，各地税务机关正在当地党、政机关及广大工人、店员的领导和协助下，坚决与偷税漏税现象作斗争。
