Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th: The Indonesian government delivered a note to the U.S. government on the 9th, protesting against the U.S. policy of suppressing natural rubber prices, because Indonesia has suffered significant economic losses as a result. Previously, the Indonesian government had lodged a protest with the U.S. government on May 4th of this year.

    The Indonesian government's note pointed out that the U.S. government has adopted methods of subsidizing the synthetic rubber industry and lowering the selling price of synthetic rubber, thereby suppressing the price of natural rubber. This U.S. policy has seriously affected the economies of Indonesia and other Asian countries that rely on natural rubber exports as their main source of foreign exchange. The note expressed concern about the U.S. government's intention to sell the currently government-run synthetic rubber factories at low prices in a way that is detrimental to the natural rubber industry. It protested against the U.S. continuing to produce and sell synthetic rubber with government subsidies before selling the synthetic rubber factories.

    However, according to Reuters, after the Indonesian government lodged its protest, U.S. officials stated that the U.S. does not intend to take any measures to alleviate the serious difficulties encountered by Indonesia. Leroy Johnson, the head of the six-member delegation of the U.S. House of Representatives Military Subcommittee currently "visiting" Malaya, also stated: "It is impossible for the United States to take any measures."

    印尼再次抗议美国压低胶价
    【新华社十六日讯】华盛顿消息：印尼政府九日向美国政府递送了照会一份，抗议美国所实行的压低天然橡胶价格政策，因为印尼已经因此在经济上受到了重大的损失。在这以前，印尼政府曾在今年五月四日向美国政府提出过一次抗议。
    印尼政府的照会指出：美国政府采取了补贴人造橡胶工业的办法，降低人造橡胶的售价，从而压低天然橡胶的价格；美国这一政策，使得依靠天然橡胶出口作为主要外汇来源的印尼以及亚洲其他国家，在经济上受到了严重的影响。照会对于美国政府准备用不利于天然橡胶业的办法低价出售目前官办的人造橡胶工厂，表示关怀；对于美国在出卖人造橡胶工厂以前继续用政府补贴的办法来生产和售卖人造胶，提出了抗议。
    但是，据路透社报道，在印尼政府提出抗议之后，美国官员表示：美国不打算采取任何措施来减轻印尼所遭遇的严重困难。目前“访问”马来亚的美国众议院军事小组委员会六人代表团团长莱罗伊·约翰逊也表示：“美国不可能采取任何办法”。
