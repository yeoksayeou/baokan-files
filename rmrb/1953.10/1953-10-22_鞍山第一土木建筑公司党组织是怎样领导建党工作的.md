    How the Party Organization of Anshan No. 1 Civil Engineering and Construction Company Leads Party Building Work
    Liu Yaqin
    From July of last year to the first quarter of this year, the Party organization of Anshan No. 1 Civil Engineering and Construction Company has developed 515 new Party members. Now, Party members account for 5.7% of the staff and fixed workers. The quality of the new Party members developed is generally good. Among the 318 Party members developed in 1952, 121 were promoted to cadres, and more than 50 were selected as model workers. Party organizations have been established in various construction sites and engineering teams. Therefore, the completion of engineering tasks has been effectively guaranteed.
    The success of the No. 1 Civil Engineering and Construction Company in Party building work is mainly due to the importance attached by the Party committee. Over the past year, the Party committee of the No. 1 Civil Engineering and Construction Company has taken the following measures to strengthen its leadership over Party building work.
    I. The Party committee mobilized the entire Party to do Party building work and regularly inspected and summarized the Party building work. Since the number of Party members in the basic construction sector is very small, it is even more necessary to mobilize every Party member to do Party building work. In the early stage of Party building, some Party members did not sufficiently recognize the importance of Party building work. For example, some Party member cadres who did administrative leadership work made excuses of being busy and did not do Party building work. Some general branch secretaries and branch secretaries also said: "As long as we can complete the production tasks, it doesn't matter if we don't complete the Party building tasks." These all hindered the smooth progress of Party building work. After studying the above situation, the Party committee first criticized these erroneous ideas through various branches and repeatedly explained the meaning and purpose of Party building. At the same time, every member of the Party committee took the lead in doing Party building work. Although the company manager Zheng Kang was very busy with administrative work, he still took time out during his spare time or on holidays to invite the activists and Party members cultivated by the group to his home to help them study the basic knowledge of the Party and current affairs and policies. The personal involvement of leading cadres in Party building work powerfully promoted all Party members to do Party building work, enabling everyone to correctly recognize that developing Party members is the duty of every Party member.
    Another method for the Party committee to promote all Party members to do Party building work is to regularly summarize and arrange Party building work, formulate Party building plans, conduct in-depth inspections at any time, discover problems, and solve problems. In February of this year, the Party committee convened a general meeting of all Party members to summarize the Party building work of last year and arrange the Party building work for the first quarter. After the meeting, it organized Party members to conduct self-criticism and mutual criticism on the past Party building work in branch meetings and group meetings. Party members who did well were commended and their experiences were introduced. Party members who did not do well were criticized mutually in addition to their own self-criticism, thereby arousing everyone's attention to Party building work. Finally, the branch and each Party member made specific Party building plans based on the arrangements and requirements of the Party committee (Party members made verbal or written plans to cultivate and examine activists). For example, Party members of the 501 construction site branch all made plans with specific content to cultivate and examine activists. The plans included what kind of people to cultivate, what issues to discuss with activists, and so on. In this way, the branch developed 19 new Party members in a planned way in the first quarter. After each time the Party committee deployed Party building work, it sent organizers to various branches to conduct in-depth inspections, discover problems, and specifically help the branches solve problems. For example, the division of labor among the branch committee members of the woodworking factory was not clear, and the branch did not establish a regular reporting and research system for Party building work. Therefore, the branch could not fully grasp the cultivation and examination of activists. After the organizer discovered this during the inspection, he helped the branch study and solve these problems. For example, the 501 construction site branch was not cautious enough in cultivating and examining activists. Once, the branch prepared to admit two workers into the Party. However, these two workers had a bad work style and did not have high prestige among the masses. When the organizer studied this issue with the branch, he pointed out that the branch's examination of activists was not comprehensive enough, and only looked at the performance of a particular time and event. This not only helped the branch correct its shortcomings, but also improved the Party building work level of the branch cadres.
    II. The Party committee organizes all Party members to study Party building knowledge and Party building experience to quickly improve the level of Party building work. There are 28 cadres in the company who lead Party building work. Among them, except for three organizers, other branch committee members lack Party building knowledge. To this end, the Party committee has organized a total of six studies on Party building knowledge from last year to the present. For example, the first study last year was on how to select activists, and the second was on how to grasp the standards of Party members. In February of this year, after the Party committee deployed the Party building work for the first quarter, the organization department organized another study on Party building plans because some cadres were newly promoted. When revising the list of activists, another study was organized on how to revise the list of activists, and so on. For general Party members, the method of holding forums and exchanging experiences was used to improve their Party building ability. When Party building work began last year, Party members generally reflected that they did not know how to be introducers and did not know how to introduce. Based on this situation, the Party committee's organization department held a forum for introducers. The content of the forum was: What is the responsibility of the introducer? How to cultivate activists? How to introduce, etc. Later, the Party committee sent organizers to various construction sites to hold forums. First, everyone talked freely about their experience in selecting and cultivating activists, and raised difficult issues in cultivation and examination. Finally, the organizer summarized everyone's experiences and problems and pointed out specific methods. Sometimes forums were also held on specific issues. For example, when the 501 construction site branch developed new Party members, the introducers were not sure about grasping the conditions for Party membership, so they held two forums on the issue of Party membership conditions. After these forums, the Party building ability of Party members was generally improved.
    III. The Party committee pays attention to strengthening the education of activists. Basic construction departments are newly built enterprises, and the vast majority of workers are new (especially in civil engineering and construction departments). The level of consciousness of workers is generally low. In order to do a good job in Party building, the Party committee vigorously carried out communist and Party education for activists in their spare time. Before July of last year, the Party committee divided five education zones according to the specific conditions of each factory and construction site, and opened five spare-time Party class training courses at the same time. In September and October, 11 more branches opened spare-time Party class training courses under the leadership of the Party committee. A total of 1,810 workers participated in Party class studies (mainly activists). The largest and most effective was the political education during the winter training. During the study period, Party members and those being cultivated were organized into the same group to facilitate the cultivation and examination of activists by Party members. Due to frequent education, the level of consciousness of the masses has been improved. Among the 1,380 activists in the company, 510 are eager to join the Party. This enables the Party to admit outstanding members into the Party step by step and in a planned way.
    IV. The Party committee pays attention to combining Party building work with ensuring the completion of construction tasks. Last year, some branches had a tendency to carry out Party building in isolation or only pay attention to supervising production without carrying out Party building work. After discovering this, the Party committee criticized these practices. Based on this idea, the Party committee assigned the following tasks to various branches at the beginning or end of each movement: pay attention to discovering activists in the movement and production, revise the list of activists after the end of the movement; and examine existing activists through movement and production. Therefore, various branches also paid attention to combining Party building work with production. When the West Construction Site Branch established the responsibility system in 1952, it convened a general meeting of Party members and activists to explain the significance of the movement and called on Party members and activists to play a leading role in the movement. After the meeting, the activists expressed their determination and put forward specific measures to ensure the completion of the task. After the meeting, activist Wang Shoujin proposed and improved the rationalization proposal for the partition wall, saving the state more than 5.7 million yuan. Several workers in the slag brick factory were not at ease with their work and slept during working hours. The branch then arranged for activists to carry out unity and education for them. After the activists had individual talks with these workers, they gradually changed their backward ideas. These workers played an active role in production and improved labor organization, saving three man-days per day.

    鞍山第一土木建筑公司党组织是怎样领导建党工作的
    刘雅琴
    鞍山第一土木建筑公司党组织从去年七月到今年第一季度，已发展了五百一十五名新党员。现在，党员已占职员和固定工人的百分之五点七。所发展的新党员的质量基本上是好的。在一九五二年发展的三百一十八名党员中，被提拔为干部的有一百二十一名；被选为劳动模范的有五十多名。各工地和工程队都建立了党的组织。因此，有力地保证了工程任务的完成。
    第一土木建筑公司的建党工作所以取得这样成绩，主要是由于党委重视。一年来第一土木建筑公司党委曾经采取了以下办法加强了对建党工作的领导。
    一、党委动员全党做建党工作，并定期对建党工作进行检查总结。由于基本建设部门中党员数量很少，动员每个党员来做建党工作，就更为需要。在建党初期，有些党员对建党工作的重要性认识不足。例如：有些做行政领导工作的党员干部，藉口工作忙，不做建党工作；还有个别总支书记、支部书记也说：“只要能完成生产任务，完不成建党任务不要紧。”这些都阻碍着建党工作的顺利进行。党委研究了上述情况，首先通过各个支部批判了这些错误思想，并反复讲解了建党的意义和目的。同时，每个党委委员都带头做建党工作。公司经理郑康虽然行政工作很忙，但仍抽出业余时间或假日，把小组所培养的积极分子和党员邀请到自己家里，帮助他们学习党的基本知识和时事、政策。领导干部的亲自动手做建党工作，有力地推动了全体党员来做建党工作，使大家正确地认识到了发展党员是每个党员的义务。
    党委推动全体党员做建党工作的另一个方法就是定期的总结和布置建党工作，制订建党计划，随时深入检查，发现问题，解决问题。今年二月份，党委召开了全体党员大会，总结了去年建党工作，并布置了第一季度的建党工作。会后又组织党员在支部大会和小组会上对过去建党工作情况进行了自我检查和互相批评。对做得好的党员则进行表扬并介绍了经验。做得不好的党员除自己检讨外，还进行了互相批评，从而引起大家对建党工作的重视。最后，支部与每个党员则根据党委的布置与要求，作出具体的建党计划（党员作出口头的或书面的培养考察积极分子的计划）。如五○一工地支部党员就都做出了有具体内容的培养考察积极分子的计划，计划中包括准备培养什么人，准备和积极分子谈什么问题等等。这样，该支部在第一季度有计划地发展了十九名新党员。党委每次把建党工作布置下去之后，随时派组织员到各支部进行深入检查、发现问题，具体帮助支部解决问题。比如，木工厂的支部委员分工不明确，支部没有建立定期的汇报和研究建党工作的制度，因而支部还不能全部掌握对积极分子的培养与考察的情况。经组织员检查发现后，就帮助该支部研究解决这些问题。又如五○一工地支部对培养考察积极分子的工作不够慎重。有一次，支部准备吸收两名工人入党。但是，这两名工人作风不好，在群众中威信不高。组织员在和支部研究这一问题时指出了支部对积极分子的考察工作还不全面，只看一时一事的表现。这样，不但帮助支部改正了缺点，并且提高了支部干部的建党工作水平。
    二、党委组织全体党员学习建党知识和建党经验，迅速提高建党工作水平。该公司领导建党工作的干部共二十八名，其中除三名组织员外，其他支部委员都缺乏建党知识。为此党委从去年到现在，共组织了六次关于建党知识的学习。如去年第一次学习是如何选择积极分子，第二次是如何掌握党员标准等。今年二月，党委布置了第一季度建党工作之后，因为有些干部是新提拔起来的，组织科又组织学习了一次建党计划。在修订积极分子名单时，又组织学习了如何修订积极分子名单等。对一般党员则以召开座谈会，交流经验的办法来提高其建党能力。去年建党工作开始时，党员普遍反映：不会当介绍人，不知道如何介绍。党委组织科就根据这种情况召开了介绍人座谈会。座谈的内容为：介绍人的责任是什么？如何培养积极分子？如何介绍等。后来党委又派组织员到各工地召开座谈会，先由大家漫谈自己选择培养积极分子的经验，并提出培养考察中的困难问题，最后由组织员把大家的经验和问题加以综合指出具体办法。有时也按专门问题进行座谈，如五○一工地支部在发展新党员时，介绍人对入党条件的掌握没有把握，因此就座谈了两次入党条件问题。经过这些座谈会以后，党员的建党能力普遍提高。
    三、党委注意加强对积极分子的教育工作。基本建设部门是新建企业，绝大部分工人是新来的（尤其是土木建筑部门），工人的觉悟程度一般都较低。为了做好建党工作，党委在业余时间对积极分子大力进行了共产主义与共产党的教育。去年七月份以前，党委根据各工厂、工地的具体条件划分了五个教育区，在同一个时间内开办了五处业余党课训练班。九、十月份又有十一个支部在党委的领导下办了业余党课训练班。前后共有一千八百一十名工人参加党课学习（主要是积极分子）。而规模最大，收效最好的是冬训中的政治教育。在学习期间把党员和培养的对象编在一个组，便于党员对积极分子进行培养考察工作。由于经常地进行教育，群众的觉悟程度提高了。该公司现有一千三百八十名积极分子中，迫切要求入党的有五百一十名。这就使得党能够有步骤有计划地将其中优秀的分子吸收入党。
    四、党委注意了使建党工作与保证完成施工任务相结合。去年有些支部曾有孤立地进行建党或只注意监督生产不进行建党工作的偏向。党委发现后，对这些作法都进行了批判。在这思想基础上党委在每次运动开始或运动将要结束时，给各支部布置以下的工作：注意发现运动和生产中的积极分子，在运动结束之后，修订积极分子名单；对已有的积极分子通过运动和生产进行考察。因此，各支部也就注意了建党工作与生产相结合。西工地支部一九五二年建立责任制时，召开了党员和积极分子大会，讲清运动的意义，并号召党员、积极分子在运动中起带头作用。会后积极分子都纷纷表示决心，提出了保证完成任务的具体办法。积极分子王守金会后提出和改进了间壁墙的合理化建议，给国家节省了五百七十多万元。矿渣砖厂支部有几个工人工作不安心，在工作时间睡觉。支部就布置积极分子对他们进行团结教育。积极分子和这些工人进行个别谈话后，逐渐转变了他们的落后思想。这几个工人在生产中发挥了积极性，改进了劳动组织，每天节省了三个人工。
