    We Study on the Great Motherland's Plains
    Shi Yue
    (I)
    After a year of intensive classroom study, our practical production training has begun. We have thrown ourselves into the vast and expansive plains of our great motherland, observing the natural scenery and familiarizing ourselves with the objects of our professional research. Through direct observation of various natural geographic phenomena, we are further solidifying our classroom learning from the past year, laying a foundation of perceptual knowledge for the new courses in the coming year.
    (II)
    One morning in July, the 31 teachers and students from the Natural Geography Department of the Geology and Geography Department of Peking University, who participated in the internship, embarked on their journey. Over the next twelve days, we climbed mountains and crossed ridges, passed through mountain basins such as Huailai and Xuanhua, went straight up to the Mongolian Plateau, and then folded back from Zhangbei on the Mongolian Plateau to Datong. In the areas we passed through, the typical geographical phenomena were diverse and the changes in the natural landscape were rich and enormous. For example, in the Qinghe Gorge of Zhangjiakou, on a mountain slope as high as 100 meters, we observed gravel deposits from over a million years ago in geological history, ironclad evidence of terrain evolution akin to "seas changing into mulberry fields." Near the Pufosi Temple in Shanfangbu, Wanquan County, we saw a river capture actively in progress, powerfully illustrating the principle of "headward erosion." On the Mongolian Plateau, the infinitely beautiful grasslands where "the sky is like a dome, covering all the plains" amazed us; good soil, abundant pasture, verdant fields, forest farms under cultivation...all of this greatly corrected our old, erroneous impression from books that the Mongolian Plateau was barren and desolate. On the majestic platform of the Great Wall, built on the southern edge of the Mongolian Plateau, we looked down south at the undulating mountains "inside the pass," and the dramatic erosion of the relatively soft strata of the so-called "Nantianmen Series" in large areas gave us an indelible impression. In order to protect the land of our motherland and permanently eliminate the greedy and ruthless plunder of nature, we recognized the importance of the water and soil conservation work carried out in vast areas of our motherland since liberation, and initially clarified the role that our geographic workers can play in this great work of transforming nature. Near Datong, we spent two days creating a geologically significant profile of Qifeng Mountain, collecting rich rock specimens, analyzing soil, and observing the vertical distribution of plants. This Qifeng Mountain is right on the edge of the Datong Coalfield. Zhang Jiying, Deputy Director of the Datong Mining Bureau, gave us a special report to help us better understand the area. It was the most intimate on-site education and the richest patriotic education. In the last two days, we also went deep into the Quaternary volcanic area east of Datong, tracing the lava flows during the volcanic eruption period under the scorching sun, all the way to the upper reaches of the Sanggan River.
    During these twelve days of intensive fieldwork, we only used two and a half days for sightseeing and visits, as a rest. One and a half days were spent visiting the famous ancient buildings in Datong; the other half day was spent admiring the solemn grandeur of the Yungang Grottoes. This greatly helped us to recognize the great artistic creation of the working people in history, thus deepening our love for our motherland with its excellent cultural traditions.
    (III)
    Twelve days passed like a flash, and a car filled with joyous songs carried us back to the campus, which seemed like it had been long separated from us, in the final chorus of "Ode to the Motherland." Returning from the vast and expansive plains of our motherland, the campus feels more tranquil and beautiful!
    We are indeed returning fully loaded. We are not only loaded with rich rock, soil, and plant specimens, but also with new professional gains. Through this internship, students clarified some questions that had always been vague in the classroom. For example, some students said:
    "Before participating in this internship, when I thought of river terraces, I thought they were really as neat as stairs; when I thought of volcanoes, I thought they were like a landscape painting. This time I really saw the river terraces and volcanoes, and when I think back to my original thoughts, it's really too naive and childish." The reaction of the vast majority of students was: the problem of "headward erosion," which they could never figure out in the classroom, was completely solved this time when observing the phenomenon of river capture near Pufosi Temple. This proves that only direct knowledge of geographical phenomena has the greatest possibility of forming correct geographical concepts. Secondly, students also realized the significance of linking theory with practice, thus realizing that only after encountering practical problems can they feel the importance of theoretical study; this not only made them interested in fieldwork, but also made them pay more attention to future classroom lectures and theoretical study. For example, one student said: "Before encountering a problem, no matter how the teacher explained it, I could never hold it in my mind. This time I came to the field, and every time I encountered the teacher's explanation of a phenomenon, I wanted to listen more and more." Most students said: In classroom learning, they always felt that there was a lot of repetition and little connection between the courses, and each course seemed to be isolated. But this time, when encountering real geographical phenomena, they realized that to truly understand this phenomenon, they had to understand not only geology and topography, but also hydrology; or not only soil and plants, but also climate. One student said: "Through this internship, we have initially connected the theoretical knowledge of the various courses we have learned in the classroom in the past. Before the internship, I felt that the various courses were unrelated... I lacked a clear concept and complete system for the knowledge I had learned, but in this internship, I initially understood how to integrate, connect, and comprehensively solve problems using the theoretical knowledge I had learned." The reflection of these opinions should first of all prompt teachers to further examine the problems existing in classroom teaching, but at the same time it should also be affirmed that even at the current level of teaching, this practical production internship has played a certain role in consolidating and digesting the classroom lectures of the past year. Finally, the students did absorb some perceptual knowledge in the complex and diverse geographical phenomena as a basis for the next stage of theoretical study. For example, one student wrote very specifically: "In this field practice, I have a preliminary concept of the interrelationship between soil, plants, climate, geology, and topography, which provides a better foundation for studying soil geography, plant geography, and topography in the next semester, and also cultivates my interest in this area." At the same time, it must also be pointed out that through this internship, students have indeed stepped into the real world for the first time after very preliminary professional theoretical study, and have begun to contact the objects of their professional research. The eyes of their direct observation of geographical phenomena opened for the first time and saw things they could not see before. This not only stabilized their learning mood, but also inspired their love for their profession. Especially when they discovered in reality that they could undertake the great task of transforming nature after this professional training in the future, they were even more proud of their profession. One student said: "Through this practical production internship, my vision has expanded many times more than a year ago. In the past, I thought the explanation of mountains was just mountains, and what about water and rocks? My thoughts were even simpler, how could I understand their nature and secrets! This is not to say that I have never seen mountains and rivers, I grew up in a mountainous area, often climbing hundreds of meters of peaks, cutting grass and felling trees, but I didn't realize its meaning at all. But now, through this year of theoretical study and this practical production internship, the formation of those river terraces, the drag folds near Yongfeng Fort, the grasslands of Mongolia, the geology of Qifeng Mountain, and the topography of the volcanic area all have new meanings for me." Another student said without reservation: "I have never solved my professional problems very well, but in this internship, I began to have a transformation. I realized that only by comprehensively understanding nature can we better transform nature, and geographers should comprehensively understand nature." Another student affirmed: "As a future geographer, I am very proud and happy, because the motherland needs me!" No teacher is not excited to hear these words from their students. But how to further inspire students' interest, cultivate students' professional knowledge and skills, and satisfy their thirst for learning has become a primary task for the teachers of the current Department of Geology and Geography.
    In addition, we have another great gain, that is, through this internship, the harmonious relationship between teachers and students has reached an unprecedented height. From the teacher's point of view, there is really no better way to understand and care for students than fieldwork; from the student's point of view, there is no better way to approach and rely on teachers than fieldwork. Now, through concrete facts, the students realize that the teachers are really concerned about their learning, and that only by relying on the teachers can they learn better. Some students said: "You have to rely on the teacher to go to the field, otherwise you can't see anything even with your eyes." Some students said: "The reason I can understand so many things and have so many gains this time is because the teacher explained it again and again." The teachers' full preparation, advance foresight, and on-site guidance have all received the most realistic results here. In addition, teachers and students live and work together in the field, solve problems together, and take on difficulties together; even in some difficult problems, the teachers always walk in front of the students. To go up the mountain, the teachers first inspected the road; to go to the countryside, the teachers first arranged food and accommodation; all of this is to ensure that the students get the highest and greatest harvest in the limited time of the field internship. A Soviet teacher once said when talking about excursions and visits in primary school geography classes: "Excursions and visits consolidate the teacher's love for the students and make the students love and be close to the teacher." This sentence can also be applied to field production internships in higher education institutions.
    The gains we have brought back from the plains of our great motherland are extremely rich. We observe during the journey and work on the site, which not only points out new directions for our future geography teaching, but also opens up new paths.

    我们学习在伟大祖国的原野上
    石钺
    （一）
    在一学年紧张的课堂学习结束之后，我们的生产实习开始了。我们投身到伟大祖国的辽阔而广大的原野，观察自然的景物，熟习我们专业研究的对象，并通过对于若干自然地理现象的直接观察，进一步巩固我们过去一年的课堂学习，为下一年的新课程打下感性认识的基础。
    （二）
    七月的一个早上，我们北京大学地质地理系自然地理专业参加实习的师生三十一人踏上了旅途。在此后的十二天中，我们爬山越岭，经过怀来宣化等山间盆地，直上蒙古高原，又从蒙古高原上的张北折回到大同。在我们经过的地区中，典型的地理现象是多种多样的，自然景象的变化是丰富而巨大的。例如：我们曾在张家口的清河峡谷高达一百公尺的山陂上观察到地质史上一百几十万年以前的砾石沉积，铁证一般说明了“沧海桑田”似的地形演变；我们曾在万全县膳房堡普佛寺附近看到了正在活泼进行中的河流袭夺，强而有力地说明了“向源侵蚀”的原理。在蒙古高原上，“天似穹庐，笼盖四野”的无限美好的大草原使我们惊叹；良好的土壤，丰盛的牧草，碧油油的原野，正在培植中的林场，……这一切都大大纠正了我们旧日从书本上得来的蒙古高原荒凉不毛的错误印象。在修筑于蒙古高原南部边缘的万里长城的神威台上，我们俯首南望“塞内”丛山，波浪起伏，而大片地区内所谓“南天门系”的较软地层的剧烈侵蚀，更给我们以不可磨灭的印象。为了保护祖国的大地，永久杜绝对于自然的贪婪无情的掠夺，我们认识了解放以来在祖国广大地区上所进行的水土保持工作的重要性，并初步明确认识了我们地理工作者在这项伟大的改造自然的工作中所能起的作用。在大同附近，我们曾以两天的时间作了具有典型意义的七峰山的地质剖面，采集了丰富的岩石标本，作了土壤分析，观察了植物的垂直分布。这七峰山正当大同煤田的边际。大同矿务局的张继英副局长为了帮助我们更好地认识这一地区，专门为我们作了一次报告。那是一课最亲切的现场教育，也是一课最丰富的爱国主义教育。在最后两天中，我们还曾深入大同以东第四纪的火山地区，在炎炎烈日之下追踪火山喷发时期的溶岩流，一直到桑乾河的上游。
    在这十二天紧张的野外实习中，我们只用了两个半天的时间来游览参观，权作休息。一个半天我们参观了大同城内有名的古代建筑；另一个半天我们瞻仰了云岗石刻的庄严壮丽。这又大大帮助我们认识了历史上劳动人民伟大的艺术创造，从而加深了我们对于自己富有优秀文化传统的祖国的热爱。
    （三）
    十二天像飞一样地过去了，洋溢着欢腾的歌声的一部车子，在最后一曲“歌唱祖国”的大合唱声中，把我们载回了好像是久别后的校园。从祖国辽阔而广大的原野中回来，觉得校园更幽静更美丽了！
    我们确实是满载而归的。我们不但满载了丰富的岩石、土壤和植物标本，而且还满载了业务上的新收获。同学们通过这次实习，弄清楚了在课堂里始终模糊不清的一些问题。例如，有的同学说：
    “在没有参加这次实习以前，我想起河谷阶地就以为真的像楼梯那样整齐；想起火山，就以为像一幅风景画。这一次真的看到了河谷阶地和火山，回想起我当初的想法，实在是太天真太幼稚了。”绝大部分同学的反应是：在课堂里始终想不通的“向源侵蚀”的问题，这次在观察普佛寺附近河流袭夺的现象时得到了彻底的解决。这就证明了只有直接认识地理现象才有最大可能形成正确的地理概念。其次，同学们也体会到理论联系实际的意义，从而认识到只有在接触了实际问题之后，才更感觉到理论学习的重要；这就使自己不但对野外实习发生了兴趣，而且对今后的课堂讲授和理论学习，也更加重视。例如，有的同学说：“没有碰到问题以前，无论先生怎么讲，脑子里总是挂不住。这次来到野外，每遇到先生对于一种现象的解释，我都是越听越要听。”多数同学说：在课堂里的学习，总觉得各门课程之间重复多而联系少，一门一门课程好像都是孤立的。可是这一次在遇到真实的地理现象时，才知道要真正地了解这一现象，不但要懂地质、地形、还要懂水文；或者是不但要懂土壤、植物，还要懂得气候。一个同学说：“经过这次实习，把我们过去在课堂上所学习的各门课程的理论知识，都初步联系起来。在实习以前，觉得各门功课都是各不相干的……对于所学到的知识，缺少明确的概念和完整的体系，但在这次实习中，初步领会了如何将所学到的理论知识融合起来、联系起来，全面地解决问题。”以上这些意见的反映，首先应该促醒教师们去进一步检查课堂教学中所存在的问题，但同时也应当肯定：即使在现有的教学水平上，这一次的生产实习对于过去一年的课堂讲授也是起了一定的巩固和消化作用的。最后，同学们也确实在复杂多样的地理现象里，吸取了一些感性的认识作为下一阶段理论学习的基础。例如一个同学十分具体地写道：“在这次野外实习中，对于土壤、植物、气候、地质和地形的相互关系有了初步的概念，这样对于学习下学期的土壤地理及植物地理和地形学有了较好的基础，也培养了这方面的兴趣。”同时，还必须指出：通过这次实习，同学们确实是在极初步的专业理论学习之后，真正走进了现实的世界，开始接触了自己专业研究的对象。他们对于地理现象直接观察的眼睛第一次睁开了，并且看见了以前看不见的东西。这样不但安定了他们的学习情绪，而且启发了他们对于自己专业的爱好。特别是当他们在现实中发现了自己经过这种专业训练、将来可以负担起改造自然的伟大的任务时，更产生了对于自己专业的自豪感。一个同学说：“通过这次的生产实习，使我的眼光比一年以前不知放大了多少倍。过去我认为山的解释就是山，水、岩石呢？想法更简单了，那里能够了解其中的性质和秘密呢！这并不是说我未曾见过山川河流，我生长在山区里，经常攀上数百公尺的山峰，割草伐木，可是我一点儿也体会不到它的意思。但现在，通过这一年的理论学习和这次的生产实习，那些河谷阶地的生成、永丰堡附近的拖拽褶皱、蒙古的草原、七峰山的地质、火山区的地形，都对我有了新的意义。”另一个同学毫不掩饰地说：“我对自己的专业问题始终没有很好地解决，但在这次实习里，我开始有了转变。我认识到只有全面认识自然，才能更好地改造自然，而地理工作者就正应该全面地去了解自然。”还有一个同学肯定地写道：“作为一个将来的地理工作者，是非常自豪和幸福的，因为祖国需要我！”听到自己学生口里说出来的这些话，没有一个教师不兴奋的。但今后如何进一步启发学生的兴趣，培养学生的专业知识和本领，满足他们在学习上如饥如渴的要求，就成了当前地质地理系教师们的一个首要任务。
    此外，我们还有一个很大的收获，就是通过这次实习，师生之间感情的融洽，达到了从来未有的高度。从教师方面看，实在没有比野外实习能够更好地了解学生、关心学生；从学生方面看，也没有比野外实习更好地接近教师、依靠教师。现在通过具体事实，同学们认识到教师们实在是关心他们的学习的，而且也只有依靠教师，他们才能更好地学习。有的同学说：“到野外去非依靠先生不可，否则有眼睛也看不见东西。”有的同学说：“我这一次能够懂得这么多东西，有这么多收获，都是先生一遍又一遍讲解的结果。”教师们充分的准备、事先的预察，以及现场的指导，都在这里收到了最现实的效果。加之师生在野外共同生活，共同工作，有问题共同解决，有困难共同担当；甚至在某些困难问题上，教师还总是走在同学的前面，要上山，教师们先去察看了道路；要下乡，教师们先去布置了食宿；这一切都为的是要保证同学们在野外实习的有限时间内得到最高最大的收获。苏联有位教师在谈到初等学校地理课的远足参观时曾说：“远足参观巩固了教师对学生的爱，并使学生爱慕教师、亲近教师。”这句话可以同样应用到高等学校的野外生产实习上去。
    我们从伟大祖国的原野上所带回来的收获是异常丰富的，我们在旅行中观察，在现场上工作，这给我们今后的地理教学不仅指出了新的方向，也开辟了新的道路。
