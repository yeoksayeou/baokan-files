Comrades, honored guests, fellow athletes!

The First National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Meet, after six days of enthusiastic and intense competition, has now concluded victoriously.

Comrades! The achievements of this sports meet are significant. In various sports competitions, our athletes have universally created and consolidated their personal bests: nineteen track and field events have set new national records, with ten in men's events and nine in women's events. Many outstanding athletes have repeatedly achieved new results. It should be particularly pointed out that during the competition, the athletes from various delegations demonstrated a spirit of active progress, humble learning, unity and friendship, and a new sporting ethic characterized by not being arrogant in victory or discouraged in defeat, fully demonstrating the new atmosphere of sports in the four years since the founding of New China. Our athletes have made great progress both ideologically and technically. Comrades! In just four short years, we have been able to achieve such excellent results thanks to the care and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao in sports, and also to the joint efforts of all our sports workers and athletes in following Chairman Mao's instruction to "develop sports and improve the people's physical fitness."

Comrades! This sports meet, on the one hand, reviewed the achievements of track and field, gymnastics, and cycling in our country; on the other hand, through this sports meet, it has powerfully promoted the development of mass sports in our country. Director He Long pointed out in his opening speech: "Our conference is to review the achievements of track and field, gymnastics, and cycling in the past four years, promote the popularization and improvement of these sports among the people, and further encourage and promote more people to participate in sports, exercise their bodies, and improve their health so that they can exert greater strength in the cause of building the motherland and defending peace." Fellow athletes! We cannot be satisfied with the achievements of this conference; we also shoulder the serious task of carrying out mass sports activities. We must bring the excellent spirit and style of this conference back to schools, troops, factories, government offices, and rural areas, actively promote sports to the people, organize them to participate in sports, and guide them in sports activities.

Fellow athletes! Through this sports meet, we deeply realize that only through comprehensive training and focusing on improvement can our sports technical level be improved and can we achieve good results. We hope that comrades will continue to work hard, implement scientific training methods, and strive to create higher new national records in a short period.

In this conference, the Soviet sports delegation gave us an outstanding gymnastics performance, giving us a shining example. Comrades! Learning from the advanced Soviet sports theory, experience, and technology will be an important condition for the continuous progress of sports in our country. On behalf of the presidium of the conference, I express my deep gratitude to the Soviet sports delegation.

All athlete comrades! You have demonstrated an excellent spirit and created good results in this conference. On behalf of the presidium of the conference, I congratulate you.

The successful conclusion of this conference is inseparable from the hard work and endurance of all the working comrades. On behalf of the presidium of the conference, I express my deep sympathy and gratitude to you.

I now declare the closing of this conference.

Let us shout:

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live Chairman Mao!

    荣高棠的闭幕词各位来宾，各位同志，全体运动员同志们：
    第一次全国田径、体操、自行车运动大会，经过了六天热烈、紧张的竞赛，现在胜利地闭幕了。
    同志们！这一次运动大会所获得的成就是很大的。在各项运动竞赛中，我们的运动员们普遍地创造和巩固了个人的成绩：田径赛有十九项创造了全国的最高纪录；其中男子有十项，女子有九项。不少优秀选手，一次再次地创造了新的成绩。特别应该指出，在竞赛过程中，各个代表队的运动员同志们，表现出积极进取、虚心学习、团结友爱、不骄不馁的精神和新的体育道德作风，充分地说明了新中国成立四年来体育运动的新气象。我国运动员们，无论在思想上和技术上都有了很大的进步。同志们！在短短的四年里，我们能取得这样优良的成绩，是中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席对体育运动的关怀和领导的结果；也是我们全体体育工作者和运动员们遵循着毛主席的“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的指示共同努力的结果。
    同志们！这一次运动大会，一方面检阅了我国田径、体操、自行车运动的成绩；另一方面，通过这次运动大会，有力地推动了我国群众性体育运动的开展。贺龙主任在致开幕词中指出：“我们这次大会就要检阅四年来田径、体操、自行车运动的成绩，促进这些运动在人民群众中的普及和提高，进一步鼓舞和推动更多的人民群众参加体育运动，锻炼身体，提高健康水平，以便在建设祖国和保卫和平的事业中，发挥更大的力量。”运动员同志们！我们不能满足于这次大会的成就，我们还担负着开展群众性体育运动的严重任务。我们必须把这次大会优良的精神和作风，带回到学校、部队、工厂、机关和农村中去，积极地向人民群众宣传体育运动，组织他们参加体育运动，并指导他们从事体育运动。
    运动员同志们！通过这次运动大会，使我们深深地体会到，只有全面锻炼，重点提高，我们的运动技术水平才能有所提高，才能创造好的成绩。我们希望同志们继续努力，贯彻科学的锻炼方法，争取在短时期内，创造更高的国家新纪录。
    在这次大会中，苏联体育代表团给我们作了卓越的体操表演，给了我们光辉的榜样。同志们！学习苏联先进的体育理论经验和技术，将是我国体育运动不断进步的重要条件。我代表大会主席团向苏联体育代表团表示深切的感谢。
    全体运动员同志们！你们在这次大会中表现了优良的精神，创造了良好的成绩，我代表大会主席团向你们庆贺。
    这次大会能够圆满地结束，是与全体工作同志们的刻苦耐劳精神分不开的，我代表大会主席团向你们表示深切的慰问和感谢。
    我现在宣布这次大会闭幕了。
    让我们高呼：
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
