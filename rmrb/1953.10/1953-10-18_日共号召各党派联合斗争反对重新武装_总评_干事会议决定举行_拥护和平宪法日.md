Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: Tokyo News: The Japanese Communist Party has proposed to relevant Japanese political parties that they conduct a joint struggle on the issues of the Yoshida government accepting US Mutual Security Agency "aid" to carry out large-scale rearmament and demanding that the Yoshida government earnestly provide relief to flood and wind disaster victims, in order to launch a nationwide movement centered on the aforementioned struggles. The Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party has begun to make this suggestion to the Labor-Farmer Party, the Left-wing Socialist Party, and the Right-wing Socialist Party separately, starting on the 12th.

On the 12th, Kuroda Hisao, chairman of the Labor-Farmer Party, also issued a statement expressing his intention to strengthen joint action with the Japanese Communist Party, the Left-wing Socialist Party, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) to promote the struggle against US Mutual Security Agency "aid" and against the war economy.

The "Akahata," the central organ of the Japanese Communist Party, published an editorial on the 3rd, calling on the Japanese people to strengthen unity and further strengthen the struggle against rearmament. The editorial said: Before the Yoshida government sent Ikeda Hayato to the United States with a rearmament plan, Yoshida and Shigemitsu Aoi, through the mediation of Japanese monopoly capital, reached an agreement on the issue of rearmament. This shows that the traitorous forces headed by Yoshida and Shigemitsu are following the orders of the United States, and while accepting the US Mutual Security Agency's "aid" to promote rearmament, they are attempting to establish a stable rearmament government in Japan. The editorial pointed out that this kind of traitorous deal is being conducted secretly, avoiding the eyes and ears of the people. This once again exposes that the rearmament plan is formulated for the United States.

The editorial further pointed out that the rearmament policy is a policy of intensifying the colonization of Japan and dragging the people into war. At the same time, it will further strengthen the US occupation system in Japan. The aim of the United States and the Yoshida government is to rearm Japan and use it as the main tool for US aggression in Asia. The "aid" from the US Mutual Security Agency is the selling price for selling out the Japanese people as cannon fodder.

The editorial emphasized that the forces of rearmament are being isolated. The collusion between Yoshida and Shigemitsu is by no means a manifestation of the strength of the rearmament forces, but a manifestation of their increasing isolation from the people, leading to anxiety.

The editorial concluded: The united action and united front struggle centered on workers and peasants are moving forward. Taking this movement as the center, concentrate all the struggles of the people under the slogans of anti-American, anti-Yoshida, and anti-rearmament, and push it forward. This is our current task.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: Tokyo News: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the largest trade union organization in Japan, held its fifth Executive Council meeting in Tokyo on the 14th. The meeting decided to designate November 3rd as "Day to Uphold the Peace Constitution" to oppose the Yoshida government's conspiracy to amend the constitution and thereby implement large-scale rearmament. At the same time, the Executive Council also decided that all trade unions would hold mass rallies on this day to demand higher wages and the issuance of year-end bonuses.

The Executive Council also decided that the Sohyo Central Headquarters would send staff to various parts of the country to organize worker-peasant liaison conferences to promote the nationwide movement demanding that the Yoshida government reduce military spending and provide relief for flood and frost disasters.

### 日共号召各党派联合斗争反对重新武装  “总评”干事会议决定举行“拥护和平宪法日”

    日共号召各党派联合斗争反对重新武装
    “总评”干事会议决定举行“拥护和平宪法日”
    【新华社十七日讯】东京消息：日本共产党向日本各有关党派提出建议，建议有关党派在反对吉田政府接受美国共同安全署“援助”进行大规模重新武装和要求吉田政府认真救济水灾风灾灾民等问题上，进行联合斗争，以展开一个以上述斗争为中心的全民运动。日共中央指导部已从十二日开始分别向劳农党、左派社会党和右派社会党提出这一建议。
    十二日，劳农党主席黑田寿男也发表了谈话，表示要加强和日本共产党、左派社会党和日本工会总评议会之间的联合行动，以推动反对美国共同安全署“援助”、反对战争经济的斗争。
    日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”在三日发表社论，号召日本人民加强团结、进一步加强反对重新武装的斗争。社论说：在吉田政府派遣池田勇人携带重新武装计划去美国以前，吉田与重光葵在日本垄断资本的斡旋下对重新武装问题取得了协议。这说明以吉田和重光为首的卖国势力正听从美国的命令，在接受美国共同安全署“援助”推行重新武装的时候，企图在日本成立一个稳定的重新武装政府。社论指出：这种卖国交易，是回避人民的耳目秘密地进行的。这就再一次暴露了重新武装方案是为美国而制订的。
    社论进一步指出：重新武装政策是加紧使日本殖民地化，把人民拖进战争的政策。它同时将进一步加强美国在日本的占领制度。美国和吉田政府的目的是要重新把日本武装起来，充当美国侵略亚洲的主要工具。美国共同安全署的“援助”，就是出卖日本人民去当炮灰的卖身价。
    社论着重指出：重新武装势力正在孤立起来。吉田、重光的勾结决不是重新武装势力强大的表现，而是他们越来越被人民孤立以致焦躁不安的表现。
    社论最后说：以工人、农民为中心的统一行动和统一战线的斗争正在向前发展。以这个运动为中心，把人民的所有斗争都集中在反美、反吉田、反对重新武装的口号下，并使之向前发展。这就是我们当前的任务。
    【新华社十七日讯】东京消息：日本最大的工会组织日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）于十四日在东京召开了第五次干事会议。会议决定以十一月三日为“拥护和平宪法日”，反对吉田政府修改宪法从而实行大规模重新武装的阴谋。同时，干事会议并决定所有工会都在这天举行群众大会，要求提高工资和发给年终津贴。
    这次干事会议还决定由“总评”中央本部派出工作人员，去全国各地组织工农联络会议，以推动全国人民要求吉田政府减削军费、救济水灾和霜灾的运动。
