    Message of Respect to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

    Dear Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

    The Chinese literary and art workers held their Second Congress in the capital. All the representatives unanimously resolved to extend their highest respect and heartfelt gratitude to you, the most beloved people. At the meeting, we discussed the issue of literature and art serving the great goal of the country's socialist industrialization. During the discussion, we often thought of you: it is because you, together with the Korean People's Army, defeated the American aggressors and ensured the security of the motherland that we can carry out such large-scale construction. On the correct path indicated to us by Chairman Mao, your heroic deeds and noble character will always become a great force inspiring us.

    All the representatives attending the conference were moved by your selfless spirit. We want to take you as an example, work hard to improve ourselves, and use all art forms to reflect the magnificent face of the great era.

    Let us unite more closely in the struggle against imperialism and to defend the security of the motherland!

                                    The Entire Body of Representatives of the Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers
                                                                                              October 6, 1953
