Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th – As expected, on the first morning of the explanation work, US-Chiang secret agents in the POW camps, posing as POW representatives, claimed that the POWs "refused" to leave the camps to listen to the explanations, thus preventing the explanation work from proceeding this morning. According to the plan submitted yesterday by the Korean-Chinese side to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC), the Korean-Chinese side should provide explanations to 1,000 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Camps 28 and 31 today.

At 8:10 AM, General Thimayya, Chairman of the NNRC, announced the above situation to reporters and, in front of the commissioners from various neutral nations and reporters, reiterated to the 31 so-called POW "representatives" from various Chinese POW camps the guarantees already affirmed in the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work": that no force or threats would be used during the explanations. These "representatives" initially refused to listen to the explanations at all, and then demanded that the explanation representatives enter the POWs' tents to conduct the explanations. General Thimayya firmly rejected this unreasonable demand, pointing out that it had already been stipulated that the POWs must listen to the explanations and that the explanations should be conducted at a specific location outside the POWs' camps, as agreed upon by both sides. These were unchangeable. He told these "representatives" to return to their respective camps immediately and tell the POWs to come and listen to the explanations and not to cause trouble.

The unreasonable demands of the POW "representatives" confirmed the information provided by Li Ying-seon, a repatriated Korean People's Army POW yesterday, who said: The agents have received new instructions to coerce the POWs to refuse to listen to the explanations as much as possible when the explanation work begins, and if necessary, to demand that the explanation representatives enter the POWs' tents to conduct the explanations, so as to assault the explanation representatives.

At 10:25 AM, General Thimayya met with reporters for the second time, announcing that he had given the POW "representatives" the necessary guarantees and allowed them to inspect the explanation camps, giving them ample time to explain to the POWs. If the POWs who were supposed to listen to the explanations at twelve o'clock still did not leave their camps, the Indian troops would enter Camps 28 and 31 and take the necessary measures to bring the POWs to listen to the explanations.

The US reporters were interested in hoping for disturbances in the POW camps. When meeting with General Thimayya in the morning, they immediately asked if any disturbances had occurred. At the end of the meeting, they demanded to stay with the POW "representatives" and refused to return to the explanation camps. Only under the firm request of the Indian press officer did they leave those POW "representatives."

The US observation representatives brought a radio communication vehicle, which violated the agreement. After being pointed out by our observation representatives, the NNRC agreed to investigate. According to item E of Article 3, Section 8 of the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," only explanation representatives have the right to carry radio communication equipment and communication personnel.

The US instructed the agents in the POW camps to force the POWs to "refuse" to listen to the explanations, causing the explanation work to not begin as scheduled. This is a destructive act against the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and a provocation by the US against the NNRC.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th – Due to the US instigation of secret agents in the POW camps to coerce POWs to collectively refuse to listen to the explanations, the explanation representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army did not begin providing explanations to the POWs not directly repatriated until 4:25 PM today. The US observation representatives and the interpreters provided for the NNRC constantly disrupted the explanation work. The secret agents threatened the POWs by shouting loudly, making the POWs afraid to freely express their desire for repatriation. However, despite this, ten POWs on the spot demanded repatriation today. From 8:00 AM, it was delayed for seven hours, and finally, with the efforts of the NNRC and the Indian custodial troops, 500 POWs from Camp 31 left the POW camp to come to the explanation site at around 2:00 PM.

The explanation work was carried out simultaneously in thirty-two tents divided into two explanation sites.

The secret agents had made prior arrangements for disrupting the explanation work and controlling the POWs at the explanation sites. Therefore, the POWs were still unable to get rid of the threats and influences of the secret agents in the explanation work. The secret agents deliberately made noise and shouted in the explanation tents, some even banging on the table and stomping their feet, and insulting the neutral personnel and our explanation representatives, making it impossible for the POWs to listen quietly to the explanations. After the secret agents left the tents, they shouted and insulted loudly. Under this terrifying threat from the secret agents, the POWs said like reciting a book: "Return to Taiwan, return to Taiwan, return to Taiwan..." refusing to listen to the explanations, some even having wads of paper stuffed in their ears by the secret agents, so they could not hear the speeches.

Each explanation tent had two US observation representatives, one of whom was a Kuomintang secret agent sent from Taiwan, wearing a US military uniform as cover. They sat at the right-hand door of the explanation tent. When the POWs came in, they squinted and glared, intimidating the POWs. They completely violated the "Scope of Authority" and the detailed rules for explanation work, repeatedly interrupting the explanations of our explanation representatives, and even ignoring the prohibition of the chairman of the subsidiary body of the NNRC, standing up and loudly expressing fallacies that hindered the explanation work, hindering the smooth progress of the explanation work.

In explanation tent No. 17, the reporter saw that after our explanation representative had just begun explaining to the first POW, a Kuomintang secret agent posing as a US observation representative actually stood up and threatened the POW: "I'll show you the way, go to Taiwan, go through this door"; and the interpreter provided by the US to the NNRC also took the liberty of speaking directly to the POW, pointing out to the POW in a threatening tone: "Go to Taiwan, go through this door." This POW was forced to walk out of the "did not apply for repatriation" door under the threat of the so-called US observation representative and interpreter.

In explanation tent No. 20, the so-called interpreter provided by the US also took the liberty of saying to the POW: "This is the door to go to Taiwan," and pointed to the door of "did not apply for repatriation." Our explanation representative immediately pointed out to the chairman that this action of the US "interpreter" was a blatant violation of the "Scope of Authority." The US "interpreter" tried to quibble, but after the Indian chairman of the subsidiary body of the NNRC warned: "You have no right to answer the POWs without authorization," the US "interpreter" was speechless.

Our explanation representatives treated every POW who came to listen to the explanations with a kind attitude, and on behalf of the people of the motherland, expressed concern and condolences for their unfortunate experiences after being captured, hoping that they would eliminate their doubts and fears and return to a life of peace and freedom as soon as possible.

The process of the explanation work was as follows: 500 POWs brought out from a POW camp were divided into two groups of 250 people each and entered the waiting tents, then each group was divided into groups of 25 people and brought to the preparation tents, and then one by one by the Indian soldiers to the explanation tents to listen to the explanations.

Before the explanations, the Indian chairman of the subsidiary body of the NNRC introduced to each POW the situation regarding the explanations and the application for repatriation, and then our explanation representatives began the explanations.

Due to the US instigation of secret agents to carry out sabotage, the starting time was delayed, so that the explanation work for 500 people today was delayed until 6:45 PM before it was completed.

### 解释工作在冲破美蒋特务重重阻挠后开始  首批我方被俘人员坚决要求遣返  美方指使特务采用各种卑鄙方法进行破坏

    解释工作在冲破美蒋特务重重阻挠后开始
    首批我方被俘人员坚决要求遣返
    美方指使特务采用各种卑鄙方法进行破坏
    【新华社开城十五日电】解释工作开始的第一个上午，如所预计的，战俘营中的美蒋特务冒充战俘代表，声称战俘“拒绝”离开营场听取解释，因而解释工作在今天上午未能进行。按朝中方面昨天向中立国遣返委员会提出的计划，朝中方面今天应向第二十八号和第三十一号营场的一千名中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行解释。
    八时十分，中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军向记者宣布了上述情况，并在中立国各国委员和记者面前向三十一个从各中国籍战俘营场来的所谓战俘“代表”再度宣布了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”及“解释和访问工作细则”中早已肯定了的保证：解释时将不使用任何武力与威胁。这些“代表”始而根本拒绝听取解释，继而要求解释代表进入战俘居住的帐篷进行解释。蒂迈雅将军坚决拒绝了这种无理要求，指出战俘必须听取解释早有规定，解释应在战俘所住的营场之外的一特定地点进行是双方的协议。这些都是不可改变的。他要这些“代表”立即回到各营场，告诉战俘们前来听取解释，不要找麻烦。
    战俘“代表”的这种无理要求，证实了昨天被遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员李应善所提供的材料，他说：特务们已经得到新的指示，在解释工作开始时，尽一切可能胁迫战俘拒绝听取解释，不得已时则要求解释代表进入战俘居住的帐篷进行解释，以便对解释代表行凶。
    上午十点二十五分，蒂迈雅将军第二次会见记者，宣布：他已给予战俘“代表”们以必要的保证，并允许他们观看了解释营场，他们已有充分时间向战俘说明。假如十二时应听取解释的战俘仍不离开居住营场，印度军队将进入第二十八号和第三十一号营场，采取必要措施使战俘前来听取解释。
    美方记者感到兴趣的是希望战俘营中发生骚动。在早晨会见蒂迈雅将军时，他们劈头就问是否发生了骚动。会见结束，他们又要求和战俘“代表”留在一起，而拒绝返回解释营场，只是在印度新闻官的坚决要求下，他们才离开那些战俘“代表”。
    美方观察代表带来了无线电通讯车，这是违反协议的，经我方观察代表指出后，中立国遣返委员会允予调查。按“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第三条第八款戊项的规定，只有解释代表才有权携带无线电通讯设备和通讯人员。
    美方指使战俘营中的特务强迫战俘“拒绝”听取解释，致使解释工作不能如期开始，这是对“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的破坏行为，是美方对中立国遣返委员会的挑衅。
    【新华社开城十五日电】由于美方策动在战俘营中的特务分子胁持战俘集体拒绝听取解释，今天下午四时二十五分中国人民志愿军解释代表才开始向不直接遣返的战俘进行解释。美方观察代表和为中立国遣返委员会提供的翻译始终不断地捣乱解释工作的进行。特务分子以高声大喊威胁战俘，使战俘不敢自由地表达要求遣返的意愿。但尽管这样，今天仍有十名战俘当场要求遣返。从上午八时起，拖延了七个小时，最后在中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队的努力下，第三十一号战俘营场的五百名战俘才在二时许离开战俘营场到解释场所来。
    解释工作在分为两个解释场所的三十二个帐篷中同时进行。
    特务分子对破坏解释工作和在解释场所控制战俘都预有布置，因此，战俘们在解释工作中仍未能摆脱特务分子的威胁和影响。特务分子在解释帐篷中故意吵闹、叫喊，有的甚至拍桌、顿脚、辱骂中立国人员和我方解释代表，使战俘无法静听解释。特务分子走出帐篷后，又高声喊叫、辱骂。战俘们在特务分子这种恐怖威胁下，像背书一样地说：“回台湾，回台湾，回台湾……”拒绝听取解释，有的甚至被特务分子在耳朵里塞上纸团，不能听见讲话。
    所有解释帐篷中各有两个美方观察代表，其中一个是台湾派来的国民党特务，穿了一套美军制服作掩护。他们坐在解释帐篷的右面的门口，当战俘进来时，他们就挤眉瞪眼，威吓战俘。他们完全破坏“职权范围”与解释工作细则，一再打断我方解释代表的解释，甚至不听中立国遣返委员会附属机构主席的制止，站起来大声发表阻挠解释工作的谬论，阻挠解释工作的顺利进行。
    记者在第十七号解释帐篷中看到，当我方解释代表刚向第一个战俘进行解释后，一个冒充美方观察代表的国民党特务，竟然站起来向战俘威胁说：“我给你指路，到台湾去走这个门”；而美方提供给中立国遣返委员会的翻译也擅自和战俘直接讲话，用威胁口吻给战俘指点说：“去台湾就走这个门。”这个战俘就在所谓美方观察代表和翻译的威胁下，被迫走出“未申请遣返”的门口。
    在第二十号解释帐篷中，美方提供的所谓翻译，也擅自对战俘说：“这就是去台湾的门”，并用手向“未申请遣返”的门口指点。我方解释代表立即向主席指出美方“翻译”这种公然违反“职权范围”的行动，美方“翻译”想狡赖，经中立国遣返委员会附属机构印度主席提出警告：“你没有权利擅自回答战俘的话。”美方“翻译”才哑口无言。
    我方解释代表对前来听取解释的每个战俘一律以亲切的态度对待，并代表祖国人民对他们被俘后的不幸遭遇表示关怀和慰问，希望他们消除疑惧、早日归来过和平与自由的生活。
    解释工作进行的过程是：从一个战俘营场带出来的五百名战俘分成各二百五十人进入等待帐篷，再各分二十五人为一组带到准备帐篷，然后由印度士兵逐一带到解释帐篷听取解释。
    解释前，中立国遣返委员会附属机构印度主席向每一个战俘介绍关于解释和申请遣返的情况，接着我方解释代表即开始解释。
    由于美方策动特务分子进行破坏，推迟了开始的时间，使得今天五百人的解释工作拖延到下午六时三刻才告结束。
