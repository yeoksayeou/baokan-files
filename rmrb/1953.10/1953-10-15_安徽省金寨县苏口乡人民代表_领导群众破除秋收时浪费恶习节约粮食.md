    People's Representatives in Sukou Township, Jinzhai County, Anhui Province,
    Lead the Masses to Eliminate Wasteful Habits During the Autumn Harvest and Conserve Grain
    After the completion of the general election in Sukou Township, Jinzhai County, Anhui Province, the people's representatives led the masses to abolish the old custom of eating "harvest meals," saving a large amount of grain.
    For a long time, the farmers of Sukou Township have had the old habit of eating "harvest meals." Every autumn harvest season, every household would buy large quantities of meat, fish, wine, and vegetables, and feast on hired laborers and relatives and neighbors, resulting in great waste. This year, Sukou Township had a bumper rice harvest, and the masses' idea of extravagant eating and drinking grew even stronger; moreover, because this was an old custom, no one dared to take the lead in abolishing it. Not long ago, Sukou Township completed its general election, and the people's representatives elected in the general election considered the interests of the people in every way. In order to mobilize the farmers to pay attention to conserving grain, the newly elected people's representatives proposed to change this custom. The mutual aid team led by People's Representative Xu Zihong served eight big bowls in every household during last year's harvest, but this year, after his mobilization, none of them bought any special wine or dishes. Last year, the whole team spent more than 8 million yuan, while this year they only spent 1 million yuan. The 28 households in the ninth electoral district spent 1.56 million yuan during last year's harvest, while this year they only spent 240,000 yuan.
    After selling the grain they saved to the state, the farmers of Sukou Township bought large quantities of means of production to increase production. Xu Zihong's mutual aid team planted a total of 17 mu of wheat this autumn, and the average fertilizer application per mu can be increased by 2,000 jin compared to last year. In addition to accumulating a large amount of fertilizer for the wheat fields, Gu Sihong's mutual aid team also purchased 1,850 jin of miscellaneous fertilizer. Zhang Yunheng's mutual aid team lacks cattle power and is planning to use the grain saved after the autumn harvest to buy an ox.

    安徽省金寨县苏口乡人民代表
    领导群众破除秋收时浪费恶习节约粮食
    安徽省金寨县苏口乡完成普选后，人民代表领导群众破除了吃“割稻饭”的旧习惯，节省了大批粮食。
    苏口乡的农民很久以来就有吃“割稻饭”的旧习惯。每年秋季割稻时，家家户户都购买大量的肉、鱼、酒、菜，请帮工和亲邻们大吃大喝，浪费很大。今年苏口乡稻谷丰收，群众这种大吃大喝的思想更加滋长；又因为这是老习惯，谁也不好领头破除。不久以前，苏口乡完成了普选，普选中所选出的人民代表处处为人民利益着想。为了动员农民注意节约粮食，新选出的人民代表便倡议改变这个习惯。人民代表许子宏所领导的互助组，去年割稻时家家都是八大碗，今年经过他的动员，都没有特别买酒菜。去年全组花了八十多万元，今年只花了十万元。第九选区二十八户，去年割稻时花了一百五十六万元，今年只花了二十四万元。
    苏口乡的农民把节省下的粮食卖给国家后，纷纷购买大批的生产资料，以增加生产。许子宏互助组今秋共种小麦十七亩，平均每亩能比去年增施肥料两千斤。顾思宏互助组除已积蓄了大批上麦地的肥料外，又购买了杂肥一千八百五十斤。张云恒互助组缺少牛力，秋后正计划利用节约的粮食买一条耕牛。    （新华社）
