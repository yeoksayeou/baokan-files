Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 11th -- The US side's continued failure to fulfill its obligation to construct explanation camp facilities for the use of the Korean and Chinese representatives has created an intolerable situation of prolonged delay in the explanation work. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) sent a letter to the US side on October 8, firmly insisting that the US side should complete all explanation facilities for the use of the Korean and Chinese representatives by 9:00 AM on October 14; otherwise, the Korean and Chinese side would be responsible for the construction of the explanation camp according to its plan to complete all the above-mentioned construction work within four days.

In its reply to the NNRC on October 9, the US side not only refused to complete the explanation camp by 9:00 AM on October 14, but also opposed the construction by the Korean and Chinese side. It only stated that it could put up twenty temporary explanation tents by the evening of October 11, but did not make any clear statement as to when permanent explanation facilities could be completed. According to the decision of the NNRC, the Korean and Chinese representatives should have the freedom and convenience to conduct explanation work to non-directly repatriated Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in thirty-two explanation facilities. Therefore, the US side's reply to the NNRC on October 9 fully demonstrates that after its long-term delay of the commencement of the explanation work has been condemned by people all over the world and opposed by the NNRC, it is now deliberately using the construction of permanent explanation facilities as an excuse to continue to delay the comprehensive commencement of the explanation work, attempting to deprive the Korean and Chinese side of more than one-third of its explanation work rights.

The NNRC has made it clear that it "expressed disappointment" at the US side's reply, and has once again sent a letter to the US side on October 10, insisting on the Commission's demand to the US side on October 8. At the same time, the NNRC also informed the Korean and Chinese side of the content of its letter to the US side.

General Li Sang-cho, Chief Commissioner of the Korean and Chinese side, replied to the NNRC on October 11. He pointed out that the Commission's renewed demand for the US side to complete all permanent explanation facilities by 9:00 AM on October 14 is completely justified. The Korean and Chinese side fully supports this. However, in view of the fact that the US side is using the construction of permanent explanation facilities as an excuse to delay the comprehensive commencement of the explanation work, in order to eliminate the US side's excuse for delay and accelerate the comprehensive commencement of the explanation work, the Korean and Chinese side is willing to make a concession, and is prepared to conduct all explanation work stipulated by the NNRC from October 14 after slightly expanding the temporary explanation facilities that the US side has already constructed. General Li Sang-cho pointed out that since the US side is able to complete twenty temporary explanation tents and related additional facilities within four days, there is no longer any excuse to disagree to complete all thirty-two temporary explanation tents and related additional facilities by 9:00 AM on October 14. Furthermore, after the liaison officer of the Korean and Chinese side went to the site for inspection on October 10, it was also confirmed that the US side's construction of the above-mentioned supplementary temporary explanation tents can undoubtedly be completed well before October 14.

General Li Sang-cho also pointed out that the Korean and Chinese side has consistently advocated that the explanation work should begin as soon as possible, but after the explanation work has been delayed for so long due to the US side's obstruction, the Korean and Chinese side cannot agree that it should be deprived of more than one-third of its explanation work rights at the very beginning of the explanation work, while the US side can conduct explanation work in all the explanation facilities it has requested.

In his letter, General Li Sang-cho finally pointed out that the postponement of the commencement date of the comprehensive explanation work, which was extended due to the US side's repeated delays, should be extended in accordance with the existing decision of the NNRC.

    我方声明自十四日起开始全面解释工作
    再次表示解释期限应按遣返委员会决定予以顺延
    【新华社开城十一日电】由于美方延不履行其修建供朝中代表使用的解释营场之义务，造成了解释工作长期拖延的令人不能容忍的局面。中立国遣返委员会曾于十月八日致函美方，坚决贯彻要求美方应在十月十四日上午九时以前修好供朝中代表使用的一切解释设备，否则，即由朝中方面根据它可于四天内完成上述全部修建工作的计划，负责该解释营场的修建。
    美方于十月九日答复中立国遣返委员会，既拒绝在十月十四日上午九时以前修好解释营场，又反对由朝中方面进行此项修建，仅表示可于十月十一日晚搭好二十个临时解释帐篷，至于永久性解释设备何时可修好，则未作任何明确表示。根据中立国遣返委员会的决定，朝中代表应有自由与便利在三十二个解释设备内向不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员进行解释工作，因此，美方十月九日给中立国遣返委员会的答复就充分表明：美方在长期拖延解释工作的开始，已遭到全世界人民的谴责与中立国遣返委员会的反对后，现在又正蓄意以修建永久性的解释设备为藉口，继续拖延解释工作的全面开始，企图剥夺朝中方面三分之一以上的解释工作权利。
    中立国遣返委员会已明白对美方的答复“表示失望”，并已于十月十日再一次致函美方，坚持该委员会十月八日对美方的要求。与此同时，中立国遣返委员会并将致美方函的内容告知朝中方面。
    朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将已于十月十一日函复中立国遣返委员会。指出该委员会再次要求美方在十月十四日九时以前完成全部永久性的解释设备是完全正当的。朝中方面对此表示完全支持。但鉴于美方正以修建永久性的解释设备为藉口，拖延全面解释工作的开始，因此，如果美方仍拒绝在十月十四日九时以前修好全部永久性设备，则为解除美方拖延的藉口，加速全面解释工作的开始，朝中方面愿意让步，准备在美方已修建的临时解释设备稍加扩充后，即自十月十四日起进行按照中立国遣返委员会所规定的全部解释工作。李相朝中将指出：美方既有可能在四天之内修好二十个临时性解释帐篷及其有关附加设备，就再没有任何藉口不同意在十月十四日上午九时以前修成全部三十二个临时性解释帐篷及其有关的附加设备，而十月十日朝中方面联络官去现场进行视察后，也证实美方修建上述补充的临时性解释帐篷是毫无疑问可以远在十月十四日以前完成的。
    李相朝中将并指出：朝中方面一贯主张解释工作应尽速开始，但在解释工作已因美方的阻挠而拖延如此长久之后，朝中方面不能同意解释工作一开始它又被剥夺三分之一以上的解释工作权利，而美方却可在其所要求的全部解释设备中进行解释工作。
    李相朝中将在信中最后指出：朝中方面准备在十月十四日开始进行全面解释工作，由于美方一再拖延而延长的全面解释工作开始日期的推迟，应按照中立国遣返委员会的已有决定予以顺延。
