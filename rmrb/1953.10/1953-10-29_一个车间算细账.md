    A Workshop's Detailed Accounting
    By Our Correspondent Bai Huai
    In the State-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory's spinning workshop, workers are highly motivated in the production increase and economization campaign. The workshop's wall newspapers and blackboards are filled with team and individual production plans, and eye-catching challenge letters and responses are posted everywhere. Workshop administrator Comrade Sun Gehua told us: "Now the cadres and workers are confident in completing the plan. Without this detailed accounting, many people would have worried about not being able to complete it!"
    Originally, before the start of the production increase and economization campaign, some people always thought that it would be difficult to find more ways to improve the workshop and that the potential had been exhausted. Some even complained about insufficient manpower and requested more people, while others saw the detailed accounting as the leadership being stingy, nitpicking over everything. Later, after research by workshop cadres and activists, based on the actual situation of the workshop and relatively thorough scientific calculations, a figure was calculated, which illustrated that the workshop still had many ways to improve and much potential.
    According to preliminary calculations, if each machine rotates one more revolution per minute, the entire workshop can increase production by 21.8 million yuan per month; if the doffing time can be reduced by one second, production can be increased by 713,100 yuan per month; if a person produces one or two less slivers of clearer waste per day, one pound and ten ounces more fine yarn can be produced per month, and the entire workshop can increase production by 9.18 million yuan per month; if a person produces one less defective yarn, 1,600 yuan can be saved; if one less traveler is lost, and one less brush and broom is damaged, more than 30,000 yuan can be saved per month; if one or two less machine oil and spindle oil are wasted, and one less spindle tape is damaged, 5,000 yuan can also be saved.
    After this calculation, everyone's minds were opened. People who previously thought that no more improvements could be found and no more potential could be tapped also changed their minds. They said: "It turns out that there are still so many ways to improve and so much potential in the workshop, it's just that I didn't use my brain enough to think." People who previously thought that producing one or two more slivers of clearer waste didn't matter were also surprised and said: "Don't underestimate one person producing one or two less slivers of clearer waste per day. If hundreds of thousands of textile workers across the country all produce one or two less every day, how much wealth will be added to the country!"
    After the workers calculated the detailed accounting, tapped the potential, and earnestly learned from advanced experience, the ability to look after more spindles increased universally. They not only maintained the number of people in August, but also added 6,400 spindles to the entire workshop. In this way, in September alone, 33.24 million yuan could be saved in wages. Regarding accelerating machine operation, some people previously believed that the speed could not be increased by even one revolution, and that further acceleration would jeopardize the end breakage rate and clearer waste rate. But now, the facts prove that after increasing the speed of spinning 32-count yarn from 198 revolutions to 204 revolutions, and increasing the speed of spinning 21-count yarn from 235 revolutions to 245 revolutions, the workers can still control the machines very well. Not only did the clearer waste not increase, but it actually decreased from the original 0.7 percent to 0.5 percent. The national textile industry model group - Huang Yuzhen Group also created a new record of 0.36 percent. The end breakage rate of 32-count yarn also still maintains a level of 80 ends per thousand spindles per hour. In this way, profits of 100 million yuan can be turned over each month. In September, defective yarn also decreased from 10 kilograms in August to 5.4 kilograms, saving 110,000 yuan in costs. The doffing time of Huang Yuzhen's group has been reduced from 45 seconds to 35 seconds. The amount of travelers used has been reduced by two-thirds compared to the past.
    These concrete facts not only educated the cadres and workers, but also increased everyone's work enthusiasm and confidence in guaranteeing the completion of the plan. According to statistics, after this detailed accounting, the annual production increase and economization figures of the spinning workshop account for one-sixth of the total annual production increase and economization value of the entire factory.

    一个车间算细账
    本报记者  白槐
    国营西北第一棉纺织厂细纱车间工人，在增产节约竞赛中，大家的情绪都很高。车间里的墙报和黑板报上写满了小组和个人的生产计划；到处都张贴着显眼的挑战书和应战书。车间管理员孙葛华同志对我们说：“现在干部和工人都有信心完成计划了。要不经过这次算细账，好多人都担心着没办法完成呢！”
    原来在增产节约竞赛开始以前，有些人总以为车间里的窍门很难找了，潜力也挖掘完了。有的还嫌人手不够，要求增加人，有的把算细账看成是领导上小气，甚么东西都扣得那么紧。后来经过车间干部和积极分子的研究，根据车间的实际情况和比较周密的科学计算，算出了一笔数目字，说明了车间还有很多窍门和潜力。
    根据初步计算，每部机器如果每分钟多转一转，全车间每个月就可以增产二千一百八十万元；落纱时间如果能减少一秒钟，一个月就可以增产七十一万三千一百元；一个人一天少出一两皮辊花，一个月就可以多生产一斤十两细纱，全车间每月可以增产九百一十八万元；一个人少出一个坏纱，就可以节省一千六百元；少丢掉一个钢丝圈、少损坏一把毛刷和扫帚，一个月就可以节约三万多元；少浪费一两机油和锭子油、少损坏一根锭带，也可以节约五千元。
    这样一算以后，大家的脑筋开动了。过去认为再找不到窍门、再挖掘不出潜力的人也改变了认识，他们说：原来车间里的窍门和潜力还这样多，只怪自己没多用脑子想。过去认为多出一两皮辊花没甚么关系的人也都惊奇地说：别看一个人一天少出一两皮辊花，全国几十万纺织工人每天都少出一两，会给国家增产多少财富呀！
    工人们经过这次算细账，挖潜力，认真学习了先进经验后，看锭能力都普遍提高。他们不仅仍然保持八月份的人数，同时在全车间又增加了六千四百个锭子。这样，仅工资一项，九月份就可节约三千三百二十四万元。在加速机器运转上，过去有些人认为一转也不能加快了，再加快就保证不了断头率和皮辊花率。但是现在事实证明，纺三十二支纱的车速由一百九十八转增加到二百零四转；纺二十一支纱的车速由二百三十五转增加到二百四十五转后，工人们对机器仍然能很好地掌握。皮辊花不但没有增加，反而从原来的百分之零点七降到百分之零点五。全国纺织工业模范小组——黄玉珍小组还创造了百分之零点三六的新纪录。三十二支纱的断头率也仍然保持着一千锭每小时八十根的水平。这样每月可以增缴利润一亿元。九月份坏纱也由八月份的十公斤降到五点四公斤，节省成本十一万元。黄玉珍小组的落纱时间已从四十五秒降低到三十五秒。钢丝圈的用量已比过去减少了三分之二。
    这些具体事实，不仅教育了干部和工人，同时也提高了大家的劳动热情和保证完成计划的信心。据统计，经过此次算细账后，细纱车间全年的增产节约数字，就占全厂全年增产节约总值的六分之一。
