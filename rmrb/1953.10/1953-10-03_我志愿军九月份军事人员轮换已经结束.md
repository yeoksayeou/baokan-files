    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 2nd -- The Chinese People's Volunteer Army's military personnel rotation for September has concluded. From the 15th to the 30th of September, a total of 5,336 military personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army rotated into the country via Sinuiju, the rear port designated by the Korean Armistice Agreement, and 5,336 rotated out of the country. Note: The Armistice Agreement stipulates that rotation must be carried out on a one-for-one basis, and neither side may rotate more than 35,000 military personnel into Korea in any one month.
    The rotation of military personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is carried out under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Inspection Team. The liaison officer's office of the Korean-Chinese forces stationed at the Sinuiju port provides the Neutral Nations Inspection Team with full convenience and assistance in supervising and inspecting the rotation work. The liaison officer's office notifies the Neutral Nations Inspection Team in advance of the time and place of arrival of each batch of rotating personnel, and the liaison officer accompanies the team members to inspect.
    The rotating military personnel maintained good order while being inspected by the Neutral Nations Inspection Team. Each batch of military personnel entering and leaving by train has a chief person in charge of the train, and each carriage also has a person in charge. When the train arrives at the port station, the chief person in charge of the train reports the number of people to the Neutral Nations Inspection Team, and the personnel in each carriage remain in their original positions for inspection, and there has never been any confusion.
    In accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, our side has reported the number of Chinese People's Volunteer Army military personnel entering and leaving the country in each batch to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on time. The figures reported by our side are completely consistent with the figures reported by the Neutral Nations Inspection Team to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

    我志愿军九月份军事人员轮换已经结束
    【新华社开城二日电】中国人民志愿军九月份的军事人员轮换已经结束。九月份从十五日到三十日，中国人民志愿军军事人员经由朝鲜停战协定指定的后方口岸新义州轮换入境的共五千三百三十六名、轮换离境的五千三百三十六名。按：停战协定规定，轮换须在一人换一人的基础上进行，任何一方在任何一个月份内轮换进入朝鲜的军事人员不得超过三万五千人。
    中国人民志愿军军事人员的轮换，是在中立国视察小组监督之下进行的。朝中部队驻新义州口岸联络军官办事处给予中立国视察小组监督与视察轮换工作以充分的便利和协助，联络军官办事处预先通知中立国视察小组每批轮换人员到达的时间和地点，并由联络军官陪同小组人员前往视察。
    轮换的军事人员在接受中立国视察小组检查时保持着良好秩序。每批乘火车进出的军事人员中都有一名列车总负责人，每节车厢也有一名负责人。列车到达口岸车站时，列车总负责人即向中立国视察小组报告人数，各车厢内的人员都各就原位接受检查，从未发生混乱。
    根据停战协定的规定，我方已将每批入境与离境的中国人民志愿军军事人员的数目按时报告军事停战委员会和中立国监察委员会。我方报告的数字与中立国视察小组向中立国监察委员会报告的数字完全相符。
