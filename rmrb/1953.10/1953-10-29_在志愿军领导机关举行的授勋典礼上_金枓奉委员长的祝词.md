Comrades:

Today, on the third anniversary of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the Korean War of Liberation, I feel boundless joy in awarding the Order and Medal of the Republic to you, who have established brilliant feats of arms on the Korean front, and I extend my warm congratulations to you.

Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people not only gave enormous material and spiritual assistance to the Korean people, who rose up to wage a just war of national liberation against the American imperialist armed aggressors from the beginning of the war, but also, at the most critical moment for the Korean people, held high the sacred banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, sending their outstanding sons and daughters—the glorious Chinese People's Volunteer Army—to participate in the Korean War of Liberation, bringing about a tremendous change in the Korean war situation, strengthening the Korean people's confidence in victory, and creating strong conditions for the Korean people to win a glorious victory that could withstand arduous struggles.

Inheriting the revolutionary traditions of the great Chinese people, the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in the three years of arduous fighting against the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean peoples—the American armed aggressors—together with the heroic Korean People's Army, displayed unparalleled heroism and boldness, shattered the American imperialists' vicious aggressive plans, and won a glorious victory.

This great victory achieved by the peoples of China and Korea has become a new example of strengthening the invincible great strength shown by the internationalist unity of the peoples who have risen up for national independence and freedom.

The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, holding high the sacred banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, displayed revolutionary heroism and a noble spirit of internationalism in the fierce battles to strike at the American armed aggressors, established immortal feats, and gloriously completed the sublime task of participating in the Korean War of Liberation.

Brotherly commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in supporting the Korean people's war of national liberation, overcame all difficulties and, shoulder to shoulder with the Korean people, defended every inch of our motherland with blood. In particular, the comrades who received the Order and Medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have displayed unprecedented bravery and selflessness in the bloody struggle against the American armed aggressors and have become examples for all commanders and fighters.

Among the incomparably brave commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, many combat heroes and model fighters have emerged.

The noble patriotism and heroism displayed by the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army have proved that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is a true defender of the people's happiness and freedom and our Korean people's most reliable comrade-in-arms. Therefore, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers have been loved and respected by our Korean people everywhere and have received enthusiastic support and welcome.

The various merits and glorious achievements achieved by all the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, with you as the vanguard, during the war are a symbol of the great friendship and unity between the peoples of China and Korea and will be passed down among the Korean people for generations to come.

Dear comrades, the historic victory achieved by the peoples of China and Korea in the just common struggle against the American imperialist armed aggressors has severely struck at the insidious policies of the imperialist aggressors.

The great Chinese people's movement to resist America and aid Korea and the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army's entry into Korea have demonstrated a new example of the fraternal peoples' lofty internationalist unity and the arrival of a new era in the East.

The great unity of the peoples of China and Korea forged in blood and the great victory achieved by the peoples of China and Korea have proved that, with the support and solidarity of the international democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, the people who rise up for their national sovereignty and the freedom of the people are an invincible force capable of defeating any armed aggression by the imperialists. This has become a complete historical lesson.

The great victory of the peoples of China and Korea is the victory of socialism and people's democracy over imperialism, and the victory of the peace-loving democratic camp over the warmongers.

Today, the facts prove that the imperialists' delusion of easily invading other countries has been shattered, that any aggressive plans of the imperialists can never be realized, and that all provocative acts by the new warmongers will inevitably be bankrupt in the face of the powerful forces of peace headed by the great Soviet Union.

The American imperialist armed aggressors have realized the heroism and tenacity of the peoples of China and Korea in the three years of fighting against us, and at the same time, they have recognized that they cannot conquer the peoples of China and Korea no matter what vicious means and methods they use. Therefore, the American imperialist armed aggressors admitted that their aggression had been bankrupted by the great power of the united peoples of China and Korea, and they had to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement.

Comrades:

Although the American imperialists have stopped the Korean War, they have still not abandoned their aggressive conspiracies that threaten peace and security.

We clearly know that the danger of the enemy re-igniting the Korean War has not disappeared. Therefore, we must raise our revolutionary vigilance against the enemy, maintain a vigilant and tense posture, and be able to crush any enemy attack at any time and in any place.

Dear comrades:

I am confident that the comrades will achieve even more brilliant successes in the cause of defending peace and security.

Finally, I sincerely wish the awarded comrades and all the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army new achievements. Glory to you.

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of China and Korea forged in blood!

Glory to the commanders and fighters of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

Eternal glory to the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who sacrificed themselves in the heroic struggle against the American armed aggressors!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the beloved leader of the Chinese people!

Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung, the beloved leader of the Korean people!

Long live Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union!

    在志愿军领导机关举行的授勋典礼上
　　金枓奉委员长的祝词亲爱的同志们：
    今天值此英雄的中国人民志愿军参加朝鲜解放战争三周年之际，我向在朝鲜前线建立辉煌战斗伟勋的你们，授予共和国勋章和奖章，觉得无限高兴，并向你们致以热烈的祝贺。
    在伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下的中国人民，不仅对于反对美帝国主义武装侵略者而奋起进行正义的祖国解放战争的朝鲜人民，从战争开始给了物质上和精神上的巨大援助，而且在朝鲜人民处于最严重的时期，高举起抗美援朝的神圣旗帜，派遣了自己的优秀的儿女——光荣的中国人民志愿军，参加朝鲜解放战争，使朝鲜战局起了巨大的转变，坚定了朝鲜人民的胜利信心，并造成了经得起艰苦的斗争考验的朝鲜人民争取光荣胜利的坚强条件。
    继承伟大的中国人民的革命传统的中国人民志愿军指挥员和战斗员，在三年来反对朝中两国人民的共同敌人——美国武装侵略者的艰苦战斗中，与英雄的朝鲜人民军一起，发挥无比的英雄性和大胆性，粉碎了美帝国主义的凶恶的侵略计划，争取了辉煌的胜利。
    朝中两国人民取得的这种伟大胜利，已成为加强为民族独立和自由而奋起的人民的国际主义团结所显示的不可战胜的伟大力量的新的榜样。
    高举抗美援朝的神圣旗帜的中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员们，在打击美国武装侵略者的激战中，发挥革命的英雄主义和高尚的国际主义精神，建立了不朽的功勋，光荣地完成了参加朝鲜解放战争的崇高任务。
    兄弟的中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员们，在支援朝鲜人民的祖国解放战争时，克服一切困难，与朝鲜人民并肩以鲜血保卫了我们祖国的每分土地。特别是接受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的勋章和奖章的同志们，在反对美国武装侵略者的血腥斗争中，发挥空前的勇敢性和忘我精神，已成为全体指挥员、战斗员的榜样。
    在勇敢无比的中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员中，涌现了许多战斗英雄和模范战斗员。
    英雄的中国人民志愿军发挥的高尚的爱国主义和英雄性，证实了中国人民志愿军是为人民的幸福和自由的真正的保卫者，是我们朝鲜人民最可靠的战友。所以，中国人民志愿军勇士们到处受到了我们朝鲜人民的爱戴与尊敬，受到了热烈的支持与欢迎。
    以你们为先锋的全体中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员，在战争过程中所发挥的各种功勋和辉煌战绩，是朝中两国人民的伟大友谊和团结的象征，将在朝鲜人民中流传到世世代代。
    亲爱的同志们：在反对美帝国主义武装侵略者的正义的共同的斗争中，朝中两国人民所取得的历史性胜利，严重地打击了帝国主义侵略者的阴险政策。
    伟大中国人民的抗美援朝运动和英雄的中国人民志愿军入朝作战，表现了兄弟人民的崇高的国际主义团结的新的范例，表现了在东方新时代的到来。
    以鲜血结成的朝中两国人民的伟大团结和朝中两国人民所取得的巨大胜利，证实了在以苏联为首的国际民主阵营的支持与声援下，为了自己民族的自主权和人民的自由而奋起的人民，是能够战胜帝国主义者任何武装侵略的不可战胜的力量，这已完全成了历史的教训。
    朝中两国人民的伟大胜利，就是社会主义和人民民主主义对帝国主义的胜利，也就是爱好和平民主阵营对战争挑拨者的胜利。
    今天事实证明，帝国主义者轻易侵略别国的妄想已被击破了，帝国主义的任何侵略计划绝不能获得实现，新战争挑拨者的一切挑衅行为，在以伟大苏联为首的强大的和平力量面前，必将遭到破产。
    美帝国主义武装侵略者在三年来和我们作战中已觉察到了朝中两国人民的英雄性和顽强性，同时认清了它用任何毒辣手段和方法也不能征服我们朝中两国人民。因此，美帝国主义武装侵略者承认自己的侵略已在朝中两国人民团结起来的伟力面前遭到破产，他们不得不签订朝鲜停战协定。
    同志们：
    美帝国主义者虽然停止了朝鲜战争，但是他们仍然没有放弃威胁和平与安全的侵略阴谋。
    我们清楚地知道：敌人再挑起朝鲜战争的危险还没有消逝。所以，我们应对敌人提高革命的警惕性，坚持戒备的紧张姿态，不论在何时何地都能够粉碎敌人的任何进攻。
    亲爱的同志们：
    我确信：同志们将在保卫和平与安全的事业中获得更辉煌的成就。
    最后，衷心预祝受勋的同志们和全体中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员获得新的成就，光荣归于你们。
    以鲜血结成的朝中人民的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    光荣归于英雄的中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员！
    在反对美国武装侵略者的英雄斗争中牺牲的中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员永垂不朽！
    中国人民敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅万岁！
    苏联部长会议主席马林科夫同志万岁！
