The workers of the state-run Shanxi Xinxian Winery, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, successfully experimented with using distillers' grains (waste product) to make *qu*, which can save a large amount of grain for the country. The method is as follows: First, scatter the original grains (waste product) while cold once, without adding any materials. Then, use a *qu* mold to form blocks and place them in the *qu* room. When placing, it is advisable to put two to two and a half layers to prevent collapse (because it is soft). There is no need to light the mold to start fermentation. Turn it over once a day from the third to the eighth day, and take it out of the room after twelve days, which is half the time of grain *qu*. The temperature should be one degree higher than that of grain *qu*. The quantity of distillers' grain *qu* should be twice as much as that of grain *qu*. According to preliminary calculations after the successful trial of using distillers' grains to make *qu*, each cellar can save 100 *jin* of grain *qu*, equivalent to 130 *jin* of grain, and the cost is 50,000 yuan less than grain *qu*. For this, all the workers were commended by the Xinxian Prefectural Commissioner's Office and received a silk banner. Now, they plan to universally use distillers' grain *qu* in all five production teams when reviving the distiller's grains starting from the fourth quarter, and conduct experiments on small amounts of *xiaoqu*. If all the experiments are successful, it is calculated that 3,125 *jin* of grain can be saved every day, and 975,000 *jin* of grain can be saved for the country in one year (based on 26 days per month).

    国营山西忻县酒厂试验用酒糟踩曲成功
    国营山西忻县酒厂职工，在增产节约运动中，利用酒糟（废品）踩曲试验成功，可为国家节约大批粮食。作的方法是：首先将原糟（废品）冷散一次，不加任何材料，就用曲模作用块放进曲房，放时以二层至二层半为宜，防止倒塌（因性软），不用亮霉连毛起火，三天后至八天前每日翻一次，十二天出房，比粮食曲提前一半时间，温度要比粮食曲高一度，糟曲要比粮食曲的数量多一倍。据用酒糟制曲试验成功后的初步计算，每窖能节省一百斤粮食曲，折合粮食一百三十斤，成本比粮食曲节约五万元，为此全体职工受到忻县专署的表扬，并得到锦旗一面。现在，他们计划从第四季起在五个生产小组内普遍在撂糟回活中使用糟曲，并在小?上进行试验，如果全部试验成功，计算每天能节约粮食三千一百二十五斤，一年（每月以二十六天计）就可给国家节约粮食九十七万五千斤。
