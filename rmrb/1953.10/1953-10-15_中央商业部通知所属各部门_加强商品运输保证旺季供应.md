    Central Ministry of Commerce Issues Notice to Subordinate Departments
    Strengthen Commodity Transportation to Ensure Peak Season Supply
    To strengthen commodity transportation and ensure the needs of peak season supply, the Central People's Government Ministry of Commerce recently issued a notice requiring commercial administrative departments, specialized companies, and wholesale stations at all levels to pay close attention to this work and strive to complete and overfulfill purchasing and sales plans.
    With the expansion of commodity circulation plans, transportation tasks have become correspondingly heavier. According to past practice, the volume of material transportation generally increases during the peak season, while vehicles and ships are relatively insufficient. In order to achieve the goal of timely supply and expanded sales, the Central People's Government Ministry of Commerce requires state-owned commercial departments at all levels to arrange commodity transportation work while studying peak season supply, and it is particularly necessary to do a good job in transportation planning.
    Judging from the past situation of transportation plans, the main reason for inaccurate plans is insufficient internal communication. When compiling transportation plans, they are only based on contracts or requisition orders, without understanding whether the source of goods can be organized on time and whether the figures have changed. Therefore, additions and changes are made at the time of consignment, greatly affecting the accuracy of the plan. According to materials reflected by East China and Northeast China, some units have established a system of monthly joint meetings of planning, business, and transportation departments, which has achieved good results. This is based on the planning department, reviewing commodity circulation plans, transportation plans, and the organization of goods, exchanging information and studying together to connect the three aspects. The key to whether this method can work lies in the attention of the leaders of each unit and the subjective efforts of the staff. After the Jiangsu Provincial Native Products Company adopted this method, the accuracy of the transportation plan increased from 48% in April to 82% in June.
    After having a more accurate transportation plan, it is necessary to take the initiative and actively contact the transportation department according to the planned indicators, familiarize yourself with changes in transportation conditions and combine them with market needs, and propose five-day consignment or loading plans according to different regions and different needs in order to ship on time.

    中央商业部通知所属各部门
    加强商品运输保证旺季供应
    为加强商品运输，保证旺季供应需要，中央人民政府商业部于日前发出通知，要求各级商业行政部门、专业公司、批发站切实重视这一工作，为完成并超额完成购销计划而努力。
    随着商品流转计划的扩大，运输任务也相应的更加繁重。根据往年的惯例，每当旺季，物资运输量即普遍增加而车船相对不足。为了要达到及时供应扩大推销的目的，中央人民政府商业部要求各级国营商业部门在研究旺季供应的同时，把商品运输工作安排好，特别是要做好运输计划是十分必要的。
    根据以往运输计划的情况来看，计划不正确的主要原因是内部联系不够。在编运输计划时只照合同或要货单编制，不了解货源能否准时组织好，数字有无变化，因而到托运时就要追加，变更很大，影响计划准确性。据华东、东北反映的材料，有些单位建立计划、业务、运输部门每月联席例会的办法，已收到较好的效果。这就是以计划部门为主，审查商品流转计划、运输计划和货源组织情况，互通情况共同研究，使三方面衔接起来。这个办法的能否起作用的关键在于各单位领导的重视，和经办人员的主观努力。江苏省土产公司采用此办法后，运输计划的准确性由四月份完成百分之四十八提高到六月份完成百分之八十二。
    在有了较准确的运输计划后，要根据计划指标主动积极和承运部门密切联系，熟悉运输情况的变化和市场的需要情况结合起来，按照不同地区，不同需要，提出五日托运或装船计划，以便准时起运。
