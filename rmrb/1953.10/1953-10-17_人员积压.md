    "Personnel Backlog"
    Su Baolin
    Some commercial institutions have a backlog of goods, but the China Department Store's Rehe Provincial Company has a backlog of personnel. These personnel have been backlogged for six months and are still backlogged.
    Six months ago, the department store established an inspection agency. Initially, the company's leadership did not determine the work tasks and scope of this new agency, but simply hung a "Inspection Section" sign on the door and started "office work." Later, the inspection section itself drafted a work plan and submitted it to the Rehe Provincial Department of Commerce for approval, but to this day, there has been no response.
    During this period of undetermined work tasks, the cadres of the inspection section requested work from the leadership more than once, but the leadership said, "Let's wait for the Department of Commerce's approval! You can study for now." Thus, the few people in the inspection section followed the company's work schedule, going to work and leaving work on time. They can't be said to be resting, as they are not sick; but they can't be said to be working, as they have nothing to do. Unconsciously, half a year has passed.
    The personnel of the inspection section feel very distressed about this idle work. They say, "It's terribly boring to be idle; one day feels longer than a year!" In half a year, the cadres could have done a lot of work, but it has been wasted in vain.

    “人员积压”
    苏宝林
    有的商业机构存在积压商品的现象，中国百货公司热河省公司却存在着积压人员的现象。这些人员一直被积压了六个月，现在仍然被积压着。
    六个月以前，百货公司成立了一个检查机构。开始时，公司的领导上对这个新机构的工作任务、范围都没有确定，就让在门上挂了一块“检查科”的牌子，先行“办公”了。以后，检查科自己拟制了一个工作计划，呈请热河省商业厅批示，可是，直至现在还没有下文。
    在这没有确定工作任务的期间，检查科的干部不只一次地向领导上要求工作，可是，领导上却说：“等商业厅的批示回来再说吧！你们暂时先学习学习。”就这样，检查科的几个人依照公司的作息时间，按时上班，按时下班，说是休养，他们都不是病号，说是工作，却又无事可干。不知不觉，半年时间过去了。
    检查科的人员，对这种清闲无事的工作，感到非常苦闷。他们说：“闲着难受死了，过一天比过一年还长！”半年的时间，几个干部可以做多少工作，然而就这样白白地浪费了。
