Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 25th: Our correspondent Wu Min reports: Observers here point out that a dangerous situation is developing in the Demilitarized Zone. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has been paralyzed by the empty threats of "massive bloodshed" and the excuse of "no use of force" against special agents. This new excuse of "no use of force" is being used to protect the Syngman Rhee and Kuomintang special agents in the prisoner-of-war camps. These special agents openly defy the authority and decisions of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, tearing up the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," in order to realize the American and Syngman Rhee conspiracy to sabotage the armistice.

The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces are being constrained by the Swiss government's statement. The Swiss government's statement says: "The Federal Political Department has now given the Swiss delegation clear instructions to endeavor to avoid the use of force under any circumstances." This statement has become a justification for condoning the terrorist activities of Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee special agents to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war.

It is also worth noting that during the visits of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Switzerland to the prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island and Jeju Island, the U.S. military massacred Korean and Chinese prisoners of war month after month who opposed illegal screening and insisted on their rights under the Geneva Convention, yet the Swiss government never said a word. The U.S. military used tanks, flamethrowers, and machine guns to kill and injure thousands of unarmed prisoners of war at that time, yet the Swiss government never said a word about "no use of force" and not "violating the Geneva Convention."

For many days, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has been unable to carry out its work, because some members of the commission, under the pretext of "no use of force," are obstructing the implementation of the commission's most important responsibility: ensuring that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated. For ten days, Syngman Rhee special agents, acting on orders from Seoul, have been preventing prisoners of war from coming out to listen to explanations. Returned prisoners of war revealed that as soon as a prisoner of war showed the slightest desire to be repatriated, they would be subjected to continuous and extremely cruel beatings, whippings, and killings. There was no other way to express the desire to be repatriated other than sneaking out of the barbed wire, risking arrest and murder by those Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee special agents who were guarding the camps.

Within the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, only the Polish and Czechoslovak commissioners have demanded that the commission immediately take decisive measures to salvage this serious situation. They have repeatedly pointed out that the Indian Custodial Forces, as the executive arm of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, should deal with the challenges of the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee special agents, smash their reign of terror, and enable the prisoners of war to have the opportunity to exercise their right to repatriation.

Observers here and prisoners of war who have escaped from the clutches of these special agents point out that "avoiding the use of force under any circumstances" is tantamount to helping the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee special agents use force and violence against the prisoners of war and the Indian troops. At the same time, this also means that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces can only stand by and watch as the special agents directed by the United States tear up the "Terms of Reference" piece by piece.

American propaganda and the Syngman Rhee government have also made a big fuss about the demand for "avoiding the use of force under any circumstances" and the threats of "bloodshed and heavy casualties." This is by no means a coincidence. Brigadier General Hamblen, the head of the United Nations Command's anti-repatriation group, the Syngman Rhee government, and the special agent ringleaders in the prisoner-of-war camps who despise the authority and orders of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, have all demanded that the Indian Custodial Forces "not use force." But on the other hand, the U.S. special agents are using massive force against the prisoners of war day and night, creating bloodshed and heavy casualties among the prisoners of war. The Syngman Rhee government has threatened that if force is used against the Syngman Rhee and Kuomintang special agents, it will take "appropriate action." At the same time, Syngman Rhee's spokesman openly advocated "mass escapes" and the use of force to "liberate prisoners of war" in order to achieve the goal of sabotaging the armistice agreement.

In fact, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces have every right to take action to deal with any activities that oppose the exercise of their legitimate duties. Article 3 of the "Terms of Reference" stipulates: "No force or threat of force shall be used to obstruct or compel the repatriation of prisoners of war, and no violence shall be inflicted on their persons or insult their dignity or self-respect in any manner or for any purpose (but subject to paragraph 7 below). This task shall be entrusted to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." This means that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces have the responsibility not to allow special agents to use force or threats of force against prisoners of war, or to inflict violence or insult their dignity. Moreover, according to the "Terms of Reference," this article must never be exploited to tie the hands of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces, so that they can stand by and watch the reign of terror of the U.S. special agents. Paragraph 7 of the "Terms of Reference" stipulates: "Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 above, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as diminishing in any way the power of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to exercise its legitimate functions of control over prisoners of war under its temporary jurisdiction." The clear task now for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces is to act in accordance with the established provisions, eliminate the special agents, break their reign of terror, and protect the prisoners of war. They should not compromise their conscience and submit to the special agents simply because they are dispatched by the United States. The consequences of such submission are very serious.

### 中立国遣返委员会必须按照“职权范围”办事  不应屈从美方的压力听任蒋李特务胡作非为

    中立国遣返委员会必须按照“职权范围”办事
    不应屈从美方的压力听任蒋李特务胡作非为
    【新华社开城二十五日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：这里的观察家指出：在非军事区正在发展着一种危险的局势，中立国遣返委员会已在“大量流血”的虚声恫吓和对特务“不得使用武力”的藉口面前陷于瘫痪。这种“不得使用武力”的新藉口正被利用来保护战俘营里的李承晚和国民党特务。这些特务公然违抗中立国遣返委员会的权力和决定，撕毁“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，以便实现美国和李承晚破坏停战的阴谋。
    中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队正被瑞士政府的声明束缚着。瑞士政府的声明说：“联邦政务委员会现在已给予瑞士代表团明确的指示，要瑞士力求在任何情况下都避免使用武力。”这个声明成为纵容国民党与李承晚特务进行恐怖活动以阻挠战俘遣返的凭据。
    还值得注意的是：在瑞士的红十字国际委员会访问巨济岛和济州岛战俘营期间，美国军队月复一月地屠杀反对非法甄别和坚持日内瓦公约所给与他们的权利的朝中战俘，瑞士政府却从没有讲过一句话。美国军队在当时用了坦克、火焰喷射器和机关枪杀害和打伤了成千手无寸铁的战俘，而瑞士政府从没有说过一句关于“不得使用武力”和不得“违反日内瓦公约”的话。
    好多天来，中立国遣返委员会无法展开工作，因为委员会的某些委员在“不得使用武力”的藉口下，阻挠实施委员会最重要的职责：保证全部战俘有机会行使其被遣返的权利。十天来，李承晚特务奉汉城方面的命令，一直阻挠战俘出来听取解释。从战俘营中归来的被俘人员揭露，只要战俘稍微流露出要求遣返的愿望，他们就要遭到连续的极端残酷的棍打、鞭击和杀害。除了偷偷越出铁丝网，冒着被那些在营房四周放哨的国民党与李承晚特务逮捕和杀害的生命危险外，没有其他办法可以表达要求遣返的愿望。
    在中立国遣返委员会中，只有波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员要求委员会立刻采取决定性的措施来挽救这种严重的局势。他们曾屡次指出，印度看管部队作为中立国遣返委员会的执行机构，应当对付国民党和李承晚特务的挑战，粉碎他们的恐怖控制，使战俘们能有机会行使遣返权利。
    这里的观察家以及从这些特务的魔掌中逃回来的战俘们指出：“在任何情况下都避免使用武力”，就等于帮助国民党和李承晚的特务对战俘和印度军队使用武力和暴力。同时，这也意味着中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队在美国所指挥的特务一片一片地撕毁“职权范围”的时候，只能袖手旁观。
    美国的宣传和李承晚政府也都就“在任何情况下都避免使用武力”的要求及“流血和重大伤亡”的恫吓大事渲染。这决不是偶合。联合国军反对遣返组组长美国准将汉布伦、李承晚政府以及战俘营中藐视中立国遣返委员会的权力和命令的特务头子也都要求印度看管部队“不得使用武力”。但是另一方面美方特务却日夜不停地对战俘大量使用武力，制造战俘的流血和重大伤亡。李承晚政府威胁说，如果对李承晚和国民党特务使用了武力，它将采取“适当行动”。同时，李承晚的发言人公开鼓吹“集体逃跑”和用武力行动来“释放战俘”，以达到破坏停战协定的目的。
    实际上，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队完全有权采取行动，应付任何反对它行使合法职务的活动。“职权范围”第三款规定：对战俘“不得使用武力或以武力威胁以阻挠或强使其遣返，不得允许以任何方式或为任何目的（但须参照下述第七款），对战俘人身施以暴力或侮辱其尊严或自尊。这一任务应交托于中立国遣返委员会。”这就是说中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队负有责任不容许特务对战俘使用武力或武力威胁，或对战俘人身施以暴力或侮辱。而且，根据“职权范围”，这一款绝不许反被利用来绑住中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队的手脚，使他们对美方特务的恐怖统治可以袖手旁观。“职权范围”第七款规定，“虽然有上述第三款的规定，本协定中没有任何项目应被解释为削弱中立国遣返委员会行使其合法职务和责任以控制在其临时管辖下之战俘的权力。”中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队现在的明确任务就是按照已定的条文办事，清除特务，打破他们的恐怖统治，保护战俘。他们不应该因为特务是美国派遣的而委屈自己的良心向之屈服。这样屈服的结果是非常严重的。
