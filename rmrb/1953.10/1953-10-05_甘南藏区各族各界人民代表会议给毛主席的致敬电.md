Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Representatives Conference
Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao

Respected Chairman Mao:

　　Under the brilliant illumination of your great nationality policy, in the past four years, the people of all ethnic groups in our Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region have been united as never before. Today, representatives of our Tibetan, Han, Hui, Mongolian, and Salar ethnic groups are gathered together to discuss their own important affairs and establish the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government. This is something we have dreamed of for many years, and it is the beginning of a happy life for our future generations. We are all overjoyed and inspired.

　　At this conference, we discussed and determined the working principles and tasks for the Gannan region in the future. We must strengthen unity among ethnic groups and within each ethnic group, implement the resolutions of the conference, actively develop animal husbandry and agricultural production, and do a good job in transportation, trade, culture, education, health, and other work, to strive for the construction of Gannan.

　　On the occasion of the successful conclusion of the conference, we, on behalf of the 300,000 people of all ethnic groups in Gannan, extend to you our most sincere respect.

　　We wish you eternal health and boundless longevity!

　　Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Representatives Conference
　　September 30, 1953
