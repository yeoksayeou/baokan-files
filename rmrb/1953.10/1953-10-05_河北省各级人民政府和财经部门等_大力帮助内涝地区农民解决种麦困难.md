    Hebei Province Governments at All Levels and Financial Departments etc.
    Vigorously Help Farmers in Waterlogged Areas Solve Difficulties in Wheat Planting
    Hebei Province's production and disaster relief work in waterlogged areas has achieved preliminary results. At present, governments at all levels and financial departments, cooperatives, etc., are leading and supporting farmers in disaster areas to prepare to develop sideline production, continue to supply disaster-stricken people with living materials, and at the same time regard wheat planting work in disaster areas as a blitz mission, vigorously leading farmers in disaster areas to drain water and cultivate land, supplying farmers with wheat seeds, fertilizers, etc., to ensure timely wheat planting.
    After some areas of Hebei Province were flooded, Party committees and governments at all levels actively led the people in the disaster areas to carry out production and disaster relief work. Ma Guorui, Second Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Xue Xun, Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, led a delegation to the disaster-stricken areas to express their condolences to the disaster victims and guide and cooperate with the waterlogged areas in carrying out production and disaster relief work. As of September 15, the number of acres of land drained and freed from water had reached more than 60 percent of the flooded area. Financial departments, cooperatives, etc. at all levels overcame various difficulties, vigorously supplied disaster areas with various materials, and promptly issued loans. Qingxian Cooperative alone supplied cooperative members in disaster areas with more than 1 million jin of coarse grains, 8,600 jin of kerosene, 4,200 jin of sesame oil, 8,800 jin of alkali noodles, 22 rolls of tarpaulins, and a batch of other supplies in August alone. In order to support sideline production in disaster areas, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has signed a batch of contracts for purchasing sideline products with relevant parties, and specific figures are being distributed to various disaster-stricken areas one after another.
    In order to help farmers in disaster areas solve the difficulties in wheat planting, the Hebei Provincial People's Government allocated 99.25 million jin of wheat seeds to relevant special districts and cities. Cangxian, Tianjin, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang and other special districts are transporting these wheat seeds to various counties and districts. The Hebei Branch of the People's Bank of China decided to use 83 billion yuan of wheat seed loans and 45 billion yuan of fertilizer loans mainly to support farmers in disaster areas to plant wheat. The branch also required people's banks in various counties to simplify the issuance procedures and adopt the method of carrying notes and funds to the countryside to distribute them to each village, so as to avoid farmers running back and forth and delaying production. The agricultural and forestry departments plan to sell the 2.02 million jin of pesticides stored in various places at low prices, free of charge, or on credit to support the masses in planting wheat. Local cooperatives have also prepared a large number of wheat seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Qingxian Cooperative has prepared 1.5 million jin of wheat seeds, 300,000 jin of bean cake, and 6,000 jin of "666" powder; the Hegu Temple grassroots cooperative in Guangzong County has prepared 250,000 jin of wheat seeds and 120,000 jin of fertilizer.
    Local financial departments are now supplying farmers in disaster areas with daily necessities, while transferring wheat seeds, supplying fertilizers and pesticides, and issuing loans. From September 3 to 6, the Cangxian Grain Bureau and the Cooperative Union jointly transported 745,000 jin of wheat seeds to the disaster areas. As of September 11, Xianxian, Huanghua, Yanshan, Jiahe and other five counties in Cangxian Special District had transported more than 6.1 million jin of wheat seeds to the supply stations and began to supply them to farmers. The Tianjin Special District Central Branch of the People's Bank of China has distributed 3.1 billion yuan of wheat seed loans to various counties and is now organizing the issuance.

    河北省各级人民政府和财经部门等
    大力帮助内涝地区农民解决种麦困难
    河北省内涝地区生产救灾工作已有初步成绩。目前各级人民政府和财经部门、合作社等，正领导和支持灾区农民准备开展副业生产，继续供应灾区人民生活资料，同时把灾区种麦工作当作突击任务，大力领导灾区农民排水整地，供应农民麦种、肥料等，保证适时种麦。
    河北省部分地区受涝以后，各级党委、政府即积极领导灾区人民展开生产救灾工作。中共河北省委第二书记马国瑞、河北省人民政府副主席薛迅等并率领慰问团到受灾地区慰问灾民，指导和配合内涝地区进行生产救灾工作。截至九月十五日止，排水脱地亩数已达淹地面积的百分之六十以上。各级财经部门、合作社等克服各种困难，大力供应灾区各种物资，及时发放贷款。仅青县合作社在八月份就供应灾区社员一百多万斤粗粮，八千六百多斤煤油，四千二百多斤香油，八千八百多斤碱面，二十二匹油布及其他用品一批。河北省供销合作总社为了支持灾区副业生产，已经和各有关方面签订了一批采购副业产品的合同，具体数字正陆续分配各受灾地区。
    为了帮助灾区农民解决种麦中的困难，河北省人民政府分配给有关专区和市九千九百二十五万斤麦种。沧县、天津、邢台、石家庄等专区正在将这些麦种往各县、区调运。中国人民银行河北省分行决定以八百三十亿元的麦种贷款和四百五十亿元的肥料贷款主要用来扶植灾区农民种麦。该分行并要求各县人民银行简化发放手续，采取携据带款下乡的办法，到一村发放一村，免得农民往返跑道耽误生产。农林部门计划把存在各地的二百零二万斤农药用低价、免费或赊销等办法出售，支持群众种麦。各地合作社也准备了大批麦种、肥料和农药。青县合作社已备妥麦种一百五十万斤，豆饼三十万斤，“六六六”粉六千斤；广宗县何古庙基层社已备妥麦种二十五万斤，肥料十二万斤。
    各地财经部门现正一面供应灾区农民生活必需品，一面调运麦种，供应肥料、农药，发放贷款。沧县粮食局和合作社联合社从九月三日到六日，已运到灾区七十四万五千斤麦种。沧县专区献县、黄骅、盐山、交河等五县到九月十一日为止，已运到供应站六百一十多万斤麦种，开始供应农民。人民银行天津专区中心支行已把三十一亿元的麦种贷款发到各县，现正组织发放。
