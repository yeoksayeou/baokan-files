People of Shazhouba Township, Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province
Guarantee to Carry Forward Revolutionary Traditions and Strive for Greater Glory

Respected Chairman Mao:

It has been nineteen years since you left our Shazhouba Township in Ruijin County. As the Fourth National Day arrives, we are reporting to you on our production and living conditions.

Shazhouba Township after liberation is full of new vitality. Now the mountains around our township are covered with lush pine trees, the vegetable gardens by the ponds are full of various vegetables, and the crops in the fields are growing strong and pleasing. This year, the whole township has increased grain production by 10% compared to last year; the Yang Rongfu mutual aid team has increased early rice production by more than 13% compared to last year. Our lives have also improved on the basis of increased production. The enthusiasm of the farmers throughout the township is very high. Some time ago, bean leaf rollers appeared in the bean fields, and men, women, old and young throughout the township took bamboo brooms and dustpans to the fields to control the pests, working from dawn to dusk. After three hundred and thirteen people worked hard for two days, they caught more than 190 catties of insects in total, ensuring a good harvest of more than 1,130 mu of beans. Also, in July and August, it did not rain for more than forty days, the rice fields were dry, and autumn crops could not be planted. But with the help of the People's Government, we repaired 19 ponds, 14 irrigation ditches, and 6 weirs, and newly opened 3 irrigation ditches, overcoming the drought.

Respected Chairman Mao, the reason why we can continuously increase grain production is because we have the leadership and help of the People's Government, which has enabled us to solve the difficulties in production; it is because we have listened to your instruction to "get organized" (now there are three year-round mutual aid teams, eleven seasonal mutual aid teams, and thirty-one temporary labor exchange groups in the whole township), which has improved labor efficiency. We are by no means satisfied with the current achievements. We assure you: We must keep your instructions firmly in mind: "Carry forward revolutionary traditions and strive for greater glory." In addition to doing a good job in this year's production, we have also decided to accumulate 2,000 dan of fertilizer in the near future to prepare for increased production next year. We must earnestly prepare for the work of paying patriotic public grain, so as to maintain the glory of being rated as a model township in paying patriotic public grain in the whole county last year.

The entire people of Shazhouba Township, Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province

    江西省瑞金县沙洲坝乡人民
    保证发扬革命传统争取更大光荣敬爱的毛主席：
    您离开我们瑞金县沙洲坝乡已经十九年了。在第四届国庆节来到的时候，我们向您报告一下我们的生产和生活情况。
    解放后的沙洲坝乡充满了新气象。现在我们乡四周山上长满青郁的松树，塘边的菜园长满着各种菜蔬，田间的庄稼长得粗壮喜人。今年，全乡比去年增产了百分之十的粮食；杨荣富互助组早稻比去年增产百分之十三还多。我们的生活也在生产提高的基础上改善了。全乡农民生产劲头很大。前些时候，豆田里生了卷叶虫，全乡男女老少都拿着竹帚、簸箕到地里治虫，从天刚亮忙到日落。经过三百十三人两天紧张的劳动，共捕捉了一百九十多斤虫子，保全了一千一百三十多亩豆子的丰收。又如七、八月间有四十多天没下雨，稻田旱了，秋季作物种不上。但我们在人民政府帮助下修好了十九口塘、十四条圳、六座陂，并新开了三条圳，战胜了旱灾。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们所以能够不断地增产粮食，是因为有了人民政府的领导和帮助，使我们解决了生产中的困难；是因为我们听了您“组织起来”的指示（现在全乡已有三个常年互助组、十一个季节性互助组和三十一个临时换工组），提高了劳动效率。我们决不满足于现在的成绩。我们向您保证：我们一定要牢记您的指示：“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”。我们除了做好今年的生产外，还决定在最近积肥二千担，为明年增产做好准备工作。我们要切实准备好缴爱国公粮的工作，以保持去年被评为全县缴爱国公粮模范乡的光荣。
              江西省瑞金县沙洲坝乡全体人民
