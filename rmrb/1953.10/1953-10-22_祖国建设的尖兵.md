    Pioneers of National Construction
    "We are the eyes of industrial construction"
    "We are the eyes of industrial construction, we must see through all strata, and advance rapidly for the construction of the motherland!" This is a clapper talk composed by the drillers of the Shuikoushan Lead-Zinc Exploration Team. Four-fifths of the workers in this team are new workers, including warriors who killed enemies in the revolutionary war and farmers who just put down their hoes... They had never even seen a drilling rig before, but now they are participating in the country's planned economic construction. They study basic theory and learn from veteran workers. They even run to the team headquarters two or three miles away to take technical classes on windy and rainy nights. Yi Xiuren was an apprentice three months ago, but now he is the captain of the more advanced No. 12 drilling rig in the team, and he has also trained more than a dozen apprentices. When Du Benxu first arrived at the team, when told to take a spanner, he brought a screwdriver. But now, in just three months, he has mastered the drilling rig.
    Earthquake Team in the Desert
    In an earthquake team on the Loess Plateau in northern Shaanxi, there are two female comrades, one named Yang Shiyu and the other named Yan Xingying. The comrades in the team affectionately call them Da Yang and Xiao Yan. They jointly operate a seismograph on the vast Gobi Desert. The winter in the desert is cold enough, but the comrades of the earthquake team often work in the middle of the night when the temperature is minus twenty-seven degrees Celsius and the wind is howling with snow. To keep warm, Da Yang and Xiao Yan used camel grass from the desert to make a fire. To quench their hunger and thirst, they swallowed cold steamed buns and snow together. As soon as they arrived at the construction site, they stayed with the instruments all day long, and often learned from the veteran comrades how to connect wires, set off cannons, and take photos.
    A Model Drilling Rig Captain
    Wang Wenhan, the model machine team technical captain of a certain district team of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry's Resource Exploration Headquarters, worked as a servant in a geological institution under the rule of Japanese imperialism before liberation, and later as a drilling worker, living a very hard life. After Japan surrendered, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, he lost his job and returned home to farm. After liberation, he quickly joined the Northeast Geological Survey. When the country began planned economic construction, he was very excited to leave his hometown and went to Henan Province to participate in drilling work. When he first arrived in Henan, although he fell ill due to acclimatization, he did not leave the rig for a moment. When transporting machines, he always took the lead in carrying the heaviest parts. During breaks, he assembled and sorted out the parts. He often told the workers: "Although our work is hard, it is very glorious. Wherever we drill, huge mines and factories may be built in the future." Under his leadership, when the entire team was drilling a certain well, the drilling efficiency increased by nearly one time, and the ore body extraction rate reached 93%. Now Wang Wenhan has gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.
    Exploration Personnel in the Gobi Desert
    All the comrades of a certain petroleum geological exploration team in Northwest China work with great enthusiasm, because they know that finding new oil fields is a major matter related to the country's industrialization. They walk dozens of miles a day in the Gobi Desert, surveying geological conditions under the scorching sun. Sometimes, in order to complete the survey of an area at one time and save travel time, they work until the sun goes down. When it gets dark, it is not easy to find their tents in the uninhabited Gobi Desert. Sometimes they wander in the wilderness all night and cannot find "home," but everyone still works happily.
    Daye Exploration Team Improves Drilling Efficiency
    The drilling teams under the Daye Mining Area Exploration Team have made significant progress in geological drilling work because they have done a good job in safety work and reduced various accidents. The number of personal, equipment, and in-hole accidents in each drilling team in the second quarter of this year decreased by 65% compared with the first quarter, and decreased by an average of 1.3% per month in July and August compared with the second quarter. According to the statistics of the directly affiliated drilling team, because the number of accidents decreased, the average monthly footage of each drilling rig in July and August increased by 62% compared with the average in the second quarter, and increased by 139% compared with the first quarter; the core extraction rate in August also increased by an average of 24.8% compared with the first half of the year.
    Popularizing Mud Drilling Method
    After the 321 Exploration Team of the Central Geological Department popularized the Soviet Union's advanced experience—the mud drilling method—the effect was great. The 321 team originally used clear water to flush the drill holes, which often caused serious in-hole accidents. After the workers learned this valuable experience of mud drilling (mud drilling is to use mud to flush the drill holes. Using this method can protect the hole wall and prevent collapse, seal voids and prevent water leakage, and can flush all the powder in the drill hole to ensure the smooth progress of the drilling work.), they went to the riverside dozens of miles away to find high-quality clay raw materials. The workers also helped the team leaders make equipment and testing instruments to ensure the rapid popularization of this experience. In the past, the No. 9 machine was affected by the collapse of the formation, which affected the drilling work. After using mud, it quickly removed the collapsed rock debris and completed the task ahead of schedule. The No. 6 machine had many cracks in the formation. When clear water was used to flush the drill holes, more than ten tons of water were lost in three shifts a day. After using mud, the cracks in the rock were sealed, serious water leakage accidents were overcome, and costs were reduced. (Liu Guangzhi)
    Highest Record of Petroleum Drilling Team
    In the production increase and conservation campaign, various brigades under the Petroleum Drilling Bureau launched a new record-breaking movement. In September, nine drilling teams set new daily footage records for various types of drilling rigs in the district, with daily footage of large drilling rigs exceeding 80 meters and small drilling rigs exceeding 30 meters. The daily footage of the 303 team's drilling rig was 84.84 meters. Therefore, the September plan was overfulfilled by 5.59%, and the quality of the project was guaranteed.
    In order to consolidate the achievements in September, a competition was launched between exploration areas. On September 26, the Sirlangmiao Drilling Brigade in northern Shaanxi sent a challenge telegram to the Yanchang Drilling Brigade, proposing to ensure the quality of deep exploration wells and ensure the comprehensive completion of daily and monthly planned footage. The Yanchang Drilling Brigade is actively preparing for the challenge. (Xiao Qi)
    Outdoor Club
    In the construction site of a certain district team of the Resource Exploration Headquarters of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, there is a club with various entertainment supplies, books, and newspapers. In the evening, after the workers get off work, it becomes lively here. The loud sounds of musical instruments and songs echo in the valley. The platform in front of the club is full of workers. Some are playing chess, some are reading newspapers and various pictorials, and some are playing cards. Not long ago, the district team's Youth League branch and trade union took advantage of the downtime to organize a singing team and a drama team. They are learning new songs and rehearsing short and lively dramas in their spare time, preparing to perform for the workers. The happy life on the construction site encourages the workers' confidence in ensuring the completion of tasks.
    We must find out everything about our home
    The drillers who are exploring lead and zinc in Shuikoushan, Hunan, are working hard day and night, unafraid of wind and snow. Their lives are also very happy. The workers have cleared away weeds, thorns, and rocks, and built many wide and flat roads; they have cleaned their dormitories and drilling towers very clean and arranged them delicately. They said: This is our home, we must live here for three to five years until we find out everything about our home.

    祖国建设的尖兵
    “我们是工业建设的眼睛”
    “我们是工业建设的眼睛，要看穿一切地层，为建设祖国，快步前进！”这是水口山铅锌勘探队的钻工们自己编的快板。这个队里有五分之四的工人是新工人，他们中有在革命战争中杀敌的勇士，有刚放下锄头的农民……。他们过去连钻机都没有看见过，现在参加了祖国有计划的经济建设，便一面学习基本理论，一面向老工人学习，在刮风下雨的夜晚，也跑到两三里地外的队部去上技术课。易修仁在三个月前是个学徒，现在却是队里较先进的十二号钻机的机长，而且他还培养了十几个徒工。杜本旭刚到队里时，叫他拿攀子，他却拿来起子，可是现在，仅仅三个月工夫，他已经能够掌握钻机了。
    沙漠上的地震队
    在陕北黄土高原上的一个地震队里，有两个女同志，一个叫杨师愉，另一个叫晏杏英，队里的同志都亲切地叫她们大杨、小晏。她们在浩瀚如海的戈壁滩上共同操作着一个地震仪。沙漠上的冬天是够冷的，但是地震队的同志们，经常在零下二十七度、狂风卷雪的深夜里工作。大杨和小晏为了御寒，她们用沙漠上的骆驼草烤火，为了解除饥渴，就用冷馍和雪一齐吞食。她们俩一到工地上，就一天到晚守着仪器，而且常常向老同志学习怎样接线，怎样放炮，怎样照相等技术。
    一个模范钻机长
    中央重工业部资源勘探总队某区队模范机队技术机长王文汉，解放前曾在日本帝国主义统治下的一个地质机关当杂役，后来当钻探工人，生活很苦。日本投降后，国民党反动派统治时期，他失业回家种地。解放后，他很快就参加东北地质调查所工作。当国家开始有计划的经济建设时，他非常兴奋地离开了家乡，到了河南省参加钻探工作。初到河南时，他虽然因水土不服病了，但一时也没有离开过机台。搬运机器时他总是最先扛起最重大的机件走，休息时间他就装配、整理机件。他常和工人们说：“干我们这个活虽说苦些，但是很光荣，凡是我们钻探的地方，将来都可能建立起巨大的矿山和工厂。”全组工人在他的带动下，在钻探某号井时，钻进效率提高将近一倍，矿体采取率达到百分之九十三。现在王文汉已经光荣地参加了中国共产党。
    戈壁滩上的勘探人员
    西北某地石油地质勘探大队的全体同志以高度的热情进行工作，因为他们知道，找寻新油田是关系国家工业化的大事。他们在戈壁滩上每天走几十里路，在炎热的阳光下勘查地质情况，有时为要一次勘测完一个地区，节省往返的时间，便一直工作到太阳下山。天黑了，在没有人烟的戈壁滩上，找寻自己的帐幕是不容易的，有时在旷野里转一夜还找不到“家”，但大家仍然愉快地工作着。
    大冶勘探队提高钻探效率
    大冶矿区勘探队所属的各钻探队因为作好了安全工作，减少了各种事故，地质钻探工作有了显著的进步。今年第二季各钻探队发生的人身、设备、孔内等事故次数比第一季度减少了百分之六十五，七、八两月又比第二季度每月平均减少了百分之一点三。根据直属钻探队的统计，因为事故减少，七、八月份各钻机的每月平均进尺数比第二季度平均提高了百分之六十二，比第一季度提高了百分之一百三十九；八月份的岩心采取率也比上半年平均提高百分之二十四点八。
    推广泥浆钻探法
    中央地质部三二一勘探队推广了苏联先进经验——泥浆钻探法后，效果很大。三二一队原来是用清水冲洗钻孔，常常发生严重的孔内事故。工人们学习了泥浆钻探法这一宝贵经验后（泥浆钻探法，就是用泥浆来冲洗钻孔。使用这个办法，可以保全孔壁防止塌陷，封闭空隙防止漏水，并且能冲洗钻孔内的所有粉末，保证钻进工作的顺利进行。）纷纷到几十里以外的江边去找寻质量好的粘土原料。工人还帮助队的领导制作设备和化验仪器，保证了这一经验的迅速推广。九号机过去由于地层坍塌，影响钻进工作，采用了泥浆后，迅速清除了坍塌下来的岩石块末，提前完成了任务。六号机地层裂缝很多，用清水冲洗钻孔时，一天三班就损失十几吨水，使用泥浆后，封闭了岩石裂缝，克服了严重的漏水事故，降低了成本。    （刘广志）
    石油钻探队的最高纪录
    石油钻探局所属各个大队在增产节约竞赛中，开展了创造新纪录运动。九月份有九个钻井队均创造了该区各种不同类型的钻机日进尺新纪录，其中大钻机日进尺都在八十公尺以上，小钻机均在三十公尺以上，三○三队钻机日进尺八十四点八四公尺。因此，超额百分之五点五九完成九月份计划，并且保证了工程质量。
    为了巩固九月份的成绩，探区与探区之间又掀起了竞赛。陕北四郎庙钻探大队于九月二十六日向延长钻探大队发出挑战电报，提出保证深探井的质量，保证全面完成日、月计划进尺。延长钻探大队正在积极应战。    （肖奇）
    野外俱乐部
    在重工业部资源勘探总队某区队的工地里，设有一个俱乐部，里边陈列着各种娱乐用品和书报。到傍晚，工人下班后，这里就热闹起来了。嘹亮的乐器声、歌声在山谷中回荡着。俱乐部门前平台上聚满了工人，他们有的在下棋，有的在看报和各种画报，有的在玩扑克牌。不久以前，区队的青年团支部和工会，趁着停工时间，又组织了一个歌咏队和话剧队，他们正在业余时间学习新歌和排演短小生动的话剧，准备给工人演出。工地的愉快生活，鼓舞着工人保证完成任务的信心。
    一定要把家当摸清
    湖南水口山勘探铅锌的钻工们，在不分日夜，不怕风雪地辛勤工作，他们的生活也很愉快，工人们排开野草、荆棘和乱石，修筑了很多宽坦的大道；他们把自己的宿舍和钻塔打扫得干干净净，布置得精精致致。他们说：这里就是我们的家，我们一定要在这里住上三年五年，直到把家当摸清。
