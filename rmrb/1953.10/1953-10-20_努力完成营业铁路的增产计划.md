Strive to Fulfill the Increased Production Plan for Operating Railways

The Central Ministry of Railways has formulated a plan to increase production and practice economy by 4.1 trillion yuan; of which 3.2 trillion yuan is for operating railways. All railway administrations nationwide, as well as the Shenyang and Andong Transportation Bureaus, have, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Ministry of Railways, reviewed the implementation of the production and financial plans over the past eight months and formulated specific plans for increasing production and practicing economy. Currently, various enterprise departments are increasing their car requisition plans in response to the needs of the increased production and economy movement, and various railway administrations are also requesting the Ministry of Railways to increase car loading plans. The car loading plan for October has exceeded past standards, reaching the projected level for 1954.

Can the 3.2 trillion yuan increased production plan be fulfilled? From the perspective of freight sources, the conditions for fulfilling it exist. In the first half of the year, the national railways completed 58.9 percent of the annual transportation plan and 60 percent of the annual financial revenue plan, while operating expenses accounted for only 46.6 percent of the plan. Therefore, the profit for the first half of the year reached 98.8 percent of the annual plan. The completion of the plan in the first half of the year, on the one hand, demonstrated the active efforts of all railway employees, but on the other hand, it also showed that this year's transportation plan for operating railways was actually relatively conservative, and there was insufficient understanding of the increase in transportation needs after the start of the country's planned economic construction in 1953. For example, the car loading plan for mineral building materials lagged far behind the actual car loading volume, with the actual completion in the first half of the year exceeding the plan by 53.8 percent. The actual passenger traffic in the first half of the year also exceeded the plan by 28.7 percent. Judging from the current situation, with the development of the increased production and economy movement across the country, and with the active exchange of goods after the autumn harvest, the volume of grain, cotton, daily industrial goods, and agricultural products transported will inevitably increase. The transport volume in the coming months can maintain and exceed the level of the first half of the year. The significant increase in the October car loading plan is one example. From the perspective of freight sources, there is no problem with the 3.2 trillion yuan increased production plan.

However, abundant freight sources only provide a possible condition for realizing the increased production plan. How to strengthen plan management, use limited railcars, and organize the enormous freight sources to operate normally on operating railways still requires arduous work. This is the key issue of whether operating railways can fulfill the increased production plan.

At present, the level of plan management for operating railways is not high. Due to the lack of practical transportation plans, train schedules and locomotive routing diagrams are often divorced from reality. In addition, the planning and discipline of transportation dispatching work are not strong, which further increases some confusion. The lack of planning results in phenomena such as having cars but no goods, having goods but no cars, mismatch between car types and freight types, and excessively high single-engine running rates. The lack of discipline results in phenomena such as grabbing routes, not emptying according to plan, and not receiving trains according to plan. The result of these phenomena is train congestion, transportation chaos, waste of locomotives and vehicles, and slow vehicle turnover. This status quo hinders the improvement of railway transportation capacity and is an obstacle to realizing the increased production plan. In particular, it must be recognized that the current railway transportation capacity is relatively tight in some links. The October car loading plan is close to the maximum volume that existing vehicles can handle, and the passing capacity of sections of certain lines and large marshalling stations cannot meet transportation requirements. Therefore, if the current status of railway transportation plan management is not improved, the turnover rate of locomotives and vehicles is not shortened, and normal transportation is not organized, then the 3.2 trillion yuan increased production plan will still be difficult to guarantee.

In order to strengthen plan management, it is necessary to strive to learn from the advanced experience of the former China Changchun Railway (CCR). The CCR's experience is a complete set of socialist railway enterprise management experience, and a model of the combination of advanced Soviet experience and China's specific conditions. Seriously learning from the CCR's experience is a strong guarantee for improving the current status of railway transportation plan management and completing the 3.2 trillion yuan increased production plan. Any attempt to pit the increased production and economy movement against learning from the CCR, or to believe that launching the increased production and economy movement should postpone learning from the CCR's plan is completely wrong. Learning from the CCR's experience, strengthening plan management, and launching the increased production and economy movement should focus on the following links:

First, closely contact cargo owners, strive for support from all parties, and try to achieve balanced transportation. Although there is no problem with freight sources now, the shipping plans of various departments are still not accurate, averaging only 70 to 80 percent, and plan changes are still frequent. If all efforts are not made to minimize changes in shipping plans, and the waste of locomotives and vehicles caused by frequent plan changes is not overcome, the balance rate of transportation cannot be improved, and the increased production plan will still fall through. Therefore, all railway transportation units should seriously strengthen their contact with cargo owners, clarify the view that railway transportation serves cargo owners, appropriately take care of the actual difficulties of cargo owners, familiarize themselves with the laws of freight sources and freight flows, and at the same time urge cargo owners to provide accurate shipping plans in a timely manner and strictly ship according to plan.

Second, strengthen the planning and discipline of railway transportation. Change the current situation of plans being divorced from reality, formulate transportation plans according to freight source data, formulate daily shift plans, train formation plans, and improve various technical operation processes according to transportation plans. Allocate locomotives and vehicles according to transportation plans and train formation plans, resolutely overcome departmentalism and the disorganized and undisciplined phenomenon of not seriously implementing dispatching orders, especially to strictly implement emptying orders. Now some car service departments of some railway administrations are shouting that other car service departments cannot commit departmentalism, but they themselves are the first to commit departmentalism. They believe that since they cannot guarantee that others will not commit departmentalism, it "doesn't matter" if they commit departmentalism, and there is even the disorganized and undisciplined phenomenon of "rather be punished than empty cars." This phenomenon disrupts the country's transportation plan and often affects the most important transportation tasks. Therefore, it must be resolutely overcome. For those with serious circumstances, appropriate punishment should be given to educate all personnel.

Third, mobilize all railway employees to vigorously learn various advanced experiences and further carry out the patriotic increased production and economy competition. The car service, business, locomotive, vehicle, engineering, and signaling departments of operating railways all have many advanced experiences. These advanced experiences are effective ways to improve the various business capabilities of operating railways. Seriously promoting these advanced experiences can improve railway transportation capacity in all aspects and ensure the completion of the increased production plan.

The plan for operating railways to increase production by 3.2 trillion yuan actually also reflects the transportation requirements of various enterprise units for raw material supply, product sales, and material exchange after the launch of the increased production and economy movement nationwide. The increased production and economy plans of tens of millions of factory and mine workers are waiting for railway workers to transport raw materials and export products. The commodity circulation plans of commercial departments are also waiting for railway employees to help realize. The significance of completing the increased production plan for operating railways is not only that the railway department has increased financial revenue for the country, but also that it has met the needs of the national increased production and economy movement for railway transportation. Railway leaders at all levels must educate all employees to recognize the great significance of completing the increased production plan for operating railways to the entire national economy, and organize all employees to strive to complete and over fulfill the increased production plan.

### 努力完成营业铁路的增产计划

    努力完成营业铁路的增产计划
    中央铁道部已制订了增产节约四万一千亿元的计划；其中营业铁路的增产计划是三万二千亿元。全国各铁路管理局及沈阳、安东等运输分局都根据中央铁道部的指示，检查了八个多月来生产财务计划的执行情况，订出了具体的增产节约计划。目前，各企业部门根据增产节约运动的需要，纷纷提高要车计划，各个铁路管理局也纷纷要求铁道部提高装车计划。十月份的装车计划已超过过去的标准，达到一九五四年预计的水平。
    三万二千亿元的增产计划能不能完成呢？从货源情况看，是具备了可能完成的条件的。全国铁路在上半年完成了全年运输计划的百分之五十八点九，完成了全年财务收入计划的百分之六十，而营业支出仅占计划的百分之四十六点六，因此上半年的利润已达全年计划的百分之九十八点八。上半年完成计划的情况，一方面说明了全体铁路员工的积极努力，但另一方面也说明营业铁路今年的运输计划在实际上是比较保守的，对一九五三年国家有计划的经济建设开始后，运输需要的增长是认识不足的。例如矿物性建筑材料的装车计划就远远落后于实际装车量，上半年实际完成数超过计划百分之五十三点八；上半年客运实绩也超过计划百分之二十八点七。从目前情况看，随着增产节约运动在全国开展，随着秋后物资交流的活跃，粮食、棉花、日常工业品、农产品的运量必然增加，今后数月的运量是可以保持和超过上半年的水平的。十月份装车计划大大提高即是一例。三万二千亿元的增产计划，从货源情况来看，是没有问题的。
    但是，货源旺盛只为实现增产计划提供了可能条件，如何加强计划管理，利用有限的车皮，把庞大的货源组织在营业铁路上正常运行，还需要作艰巨的工作。这是营业铁路能不能完成增产计划的关键问题。
    目前营业铁路计划管理的水平是不高的。由于缺乏切合实际的运输计划，运行图和机车交路图常常是脱离实际的，加以运输调度工作的计划性和纪律性不强，更增加了一些混乱。计划性不强，就发生有车无货，有货无车，车种与货种不符，单机走行率过高等现象；纪律性不强就发生抢交路，不按计划排空，不按计划接车等现象。这些现象的结果就是列车堵塞、运输混乱、机车车辆浪费、车辆周转缓慢。这个现状是妨碍铁路运输能力的提高的，是实现增产计划的障碍。特别是要认识到，目前铁路运输能力在某些环节上是比较紧张的，十月份装车计划，几近于现有车辆所能担负的运量的最高限度，某些线路的区间和大编组站的通过能力也不能满足运输的要求。因此，如果不改善铁路运输计划管理的现状，缩短机车车辆周转率，组织正常的运输，那么，三万二千亿元的增产计划仍然是难以保证完成的。
    为了加强计划管理，就必须努力学习原中长路的先进经验。中长路的经验是一套完整的社会主义铁路企业管理的经验，是苏联先进经验和中国具体情况相结合的典范。认真学习中长路的经验，对改善铁路运输计划管理的现状，完成三万二千亿元的增产计划是一个强有力的保证。任何把增产节约运动和学习中长路对立起来，认为开展增产节约运动就应该推迟学习中长路的计划是完全错误的。学习中长路经验，加强计划管理，开展增产节约运动应该抓紧以下几个环节：
    第一，密切与货主的联系，争取各方面的支持，尽力作到平衡运输。现在货源虽然没有问题，但各部门托运计划还不准确，平均一般只达到百分之七十到八十，计划的变更依然频繁。如果不尽一切努力把托运计划的变更紧缩在最小的范围内，不克服计划变更频繁所造成的机车车辆的浪费现象，就不能提高运输的均衡率，增产计划还会落空。因此，各铁路运输单位应该认真加强和货主的联系，明确铁路运输为货主服务的观点，适当照顾货主的实际困难，熟悉货源、货流的规律，同时督促货主及时提供准确的托运计划，严格按计划托运。
    第二，加强铁路运输的计划性、纪律性。改变计划脱离实际的现状，按照货源资料制订运输计划，根据运输计划制订日班计划，列车编组计划和改进各种技术作业过程。按照运输计划和列车编组计划调配机车车辆，坚决克服本位主义与不认真执行调度命令的无组织无纪律的现象，特别是要严格执行排空命令。现在有些管理局的车务部门叫喊别的车务部门不能犯本位主义，但自己首先犯本位主义，他们认为既然不能保证别人不犯本位主义，自己犯一下本位主义也就“无妨”，甚至有“宁受处分，也不排车”的无组织无纪律现象。这种现象打乱了国家的运输计划，常常影响最主要的运输任务。因此，必须坚决克服。对其中情节严重者，并应给以适当处分，以教育全体人员。
    第三，动员全路职工，大力学习各种先进经验，进一步开展爱国增产节约竞赛。营业铁路的车务、商务、机务、车辆、工务、电务等各部门都有不少先进经验，这些先进经验是提高营业铁路各种业务能力的有效办法，认真推广这些先进经验，就能从各个方面提高铁路运输能力，保证完成增产计划。
    营业铁路增产三万二千亿元的计划，实际上也反映了全国范围内增产节约运动开展后，各个企业单位对原料供应，产品销售，物资交流等运输的要求。千万厂矿职工的增产节约计划等待着铁路职工运来原料和输出产品，商业部门的商品流转计划也等待着铁路员工去帮助实现，完成营业铁路增产计划的意义，就不仅是铁道部门为国家增加了财政收入，而且是满足了全国增产节约运动对铁路运输的需要。各级铁路领导干部要教育全体员工认识完成营业铁路增产计划对整个国民经济的重大意义，组织全体员工努力为完成与超额完成增产计划而奋斗。
