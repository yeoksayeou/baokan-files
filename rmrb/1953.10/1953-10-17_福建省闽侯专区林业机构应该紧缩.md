    The Forestry Agency of Minhou Special District, Fujian Province, Should Be Streamlined
    Lu Yuquan from the Minhou Special Commissioner's Office in Fujian Province writes: After studying the People's Daily editorial on September 6th, "Increase Production, Increase Income, Practice Economy, Cut Expenses, and Exceed the National Plan," I deeply feel that this editorial is to the point. At present, many government departments and units still have the phenomenon of bloated organizations and waste of manpower, and it is indeed necessary to streamline redundant personnel in a planned and proper manner to save expenses. Taking our Forestry Management Office of the Minhou Special Commissioner's Office as an example, there are currently seven people, including a director, an accountant, clerks, and a correspondent. In fact, the accountant and the correspondent are all redundant personnel. After the implementation of the three-level fiscal system this year, the accounting work of the Special Commissioner's Office Forestry Management Office, in addition to managing its own seven people, only manages one special district nursery, and there is no need for one person to do it at all; the correspondent is also often idle and has nothing to do. In fact, the Forestry Management Office can be changed to a Forestry Section, and the financial accounting work can be uniformly led by the Finance and Grain Section.
    Fujian is a forest area, and it is certain that forestry should be greatly developed, but it should be done in a planned and step-by-step manner. At present, among the counties under the Special Commissioner's Office, except for Pingtan County, which only sent two cadres, the other seven counties have forestry management stations. In fact, the coastal counties are all barren mountains with no forests to manage. What is urgently needed locally is seedling cultivation and afforestation, not forestry management. Forestry cadres are needed, but adding one or two cadres to the Construction Section can solve the problem, without the need to establish a separate agency and increase expenses.

### 福建省闽侯专区林业机构应该紧缩

专栏：读者来信摘要

    福建省闽侯专区林业机构应该紧缩
    福建省闽侯专署卢玉泉来信：学习了九月六日人民日报“增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支、超额完成国家计划”的社论，深深地感到这个社论说得中肯。目前有许多机关单位还存在着机构臃肿、浪费人力的现象，的确应该有计划地、妥善地精简冗员，节约开支。拿我们闽侯专署林业管理处来说，现有主任、会计、科员、通讯员等七人，实际上会计和通讯员都是冗员。今年实行财政三级制后，专署林业管理处的会计工作，除了管理本机关七个人外，只管了一个专区苗圃，根本用不着一个人来做；通讯员也是经常闲着无事可做。实际上，林业管理处尽可改为林业科，财政会计工作可由财粮科统一领导。
    福建是林区，要大量发展林业是肯定的，但应有计划、有步骤地来做。目前专署所属各县，除平潭县只派了两个干部外，其他七县都设有林业管理站。事实上沿海各县都是童山秃秃，无林可管，当地急需的是育苗造林，而不是林业管理。林业干部是需要的，但只要在建设科内增加一、两个干部就可以解决问题，不必另立机构，增加开支。
