Shortly before National Day, as I was on a boat leaving a port at the southernmost tip of Hainan Island, sailing and plowing through the waves of the South China Sea for several hours, nearing a certain island, suddenly, the boatman pointed ahead and said with a smile, "Comrade, look!" I looked into the distance across the deep blue sea, and vaguely saw a bright red five-star national flag fluttering in the wind above a small island covered with green coconut trees.

This small island is one of the many islands scattered across the South China Sea of the motherland. Under the national flag, People's Liberation Army soldiers are vigilantly guarding the motherland day and night.

With excitement, I stepped onto the beach. I walked step by step along "Victory Avenue." The roadside was full of tall cacti and small pink wildflowers. I seemed to have entered a fairy-tale wonderland, with so many sights and sounds that my eyes and ears were not enough. When the soldiers warmly extended their hands to shake mine, I couldn't find an appropriate word to express my love for the soldiers; I simply said, "Comrades, you've worked hard!" At this moment, I heard a loud and firm reply, "Serve the people!"

Every day I lived with the soldiers on the island, I deeply felt that every soldier was faithfully practicing their heroic oath.

When the soldiers first arrived on this small island, it was an uninhabited wilderness, overgrown with weeds and thorns, crawling with centipedes more than half a foot long, four-legged lizards that could fly on grass leaves, and scorpions the size of fingernails. However, our soldiers were determined to build this desolate island into a beautiful garden.

Without houses to live in, the soldiers braved the tropical rainstorms, cut grass, felled trees, and built rows of thatched houses; they wove coconut leaves into curtains and built shelters. In less than a month, the soldiers opened up gardens around the houses, using various shells to create huge five-pointed stars, and planted various bright tropical flowers such as cruciferous flowers and agave. The soldiers gave it a name: "Peace Garden." Soon after, patches of farmland appeared on the island, covered with long vines of squash, purple eggplants that looked like balls, and other vegetables such as cabbage and peppers. At the same time, the island also heard dogs barking and saw yellow cattle grazing on the hillside; many eggs could be found all over the mountains and fields, and every mud pond had fat pigs covered in mud. In addition, the soldiers often caught some shrimp and crabs from the sea for some "seafood"; after returning from sentry duty, they would leisurely suck on sweet coconut juice under the coconut grove. In the words of the soldiers, "We have made a home on the island!" The soldiers erected wooden poles on the high ground in front of their doors and raised a five-star national flag high.

A few days before I arrived on the island, the soldiers' "home" was "wiped out" by a rare and fierce typhoon. The thatched houses were blown down, the flowers and vegetables were gone, and the eyes of the chickens and pigs were blinded by sand. Therefore, the soldiers immediately launched a struggle against the disasters brought by nature. In the scorching sun, they rebuilt all the houses in just three days, and they were taller and stronger; they reopened the "Peace Garden" and farmland, planting more flowers and vegetables. Wang Congdian, a combat hero and instructor who had performed three major meritorious services, said, "It is false to say that the soldiers' lives are not hard, but every soldier is mentally happy. Because they recognize the glory of the task and the responsibility of the soldiers, they have the strength to overcome difficulties."

One evening, I saw a soldier picking up shells on the beach, with waves rolling at his feet. I walked over and asked him, "What are you picking up shells for?" The soldier turned around and solemnly said to me, "I want to find the best-looking shells on this island and send them to Chairman Mao; in addition, I want to write a letter to tell him where I am in the motherland!" His simple wish made people feel how lovable our soldiers are, so I said with a smile, "Chairman Mao knows you are on this island!" He immediately said happily, "Does the old man also know me?"... At that moment, I saw a moving radiance emanating from the soldier's face, as beautiful as the eastern morning glow.

Although separated by mountains and seas, the soldiers' hearts are with Chairman Mao day and night. On a quiet night in the South China Sea, the moon hung high in the sky, illuminating the ocean like a piece of transparent crystal. At this time, I sat with several soldiers under the coconut trees, and I said to them: Not long ago, I saw Chairman Mao, and his health is very good. The soldiers were very excited to hear this. When they knew that I was going to Beijing for National Day this year, one soldier immediately said to me, "When you see Chairman Mao, don't forget to tell him about the situation on the island!" Another said: "Tell the old man to rest assured! Let the people of the motherland build with peace of mind! With us guarding here, imperialism will not be able to enter the gate of the motherland!"

Meng Huajun is a twenty-year-old young soldier and an excellent member of the Communist Youth League. Once, I talked with him, and he said very seriously in the conversation, "In order to defend the motherland, as long as I can breathe, I will not allow the enemy to set foot on an inch of our motherland's land!" I asked him, "But what is the motherland?" Meng Huajun stamped his foot on the ground without hesitation and replied, "This is the motherland!" -- Our soldiers are so lovable!

The soldiers have the determination and confidence to turn the small island into a steel fortress of the motherland. They diligently build the motherland's island, regardless of the tropical sun burning their skin like needles, regardless of the hot sand, and regardless of typhoons and rainstorms. The soldiers on the island often use the spirit of the volunteers overcoming difficulties in Korea, the deeds of the warriors who built roads on the Kangzang Plateau, and the victory of the fraternal troops in annihilating the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on Dongshan Island to encourage themselves. Their common oath is: Overcome difficulties, defend the island, and defend the economic construction of the motherland!

Although the small island is far away from the mainland and has inconvenient transportation, the troops guarding the island are always receiving the care and support of the people of the motherland. Leaders at all levels not only often come across the sea to visit them in person, but also often send film teams to show movies, and also send many accordions, radios, sanxians, gongs and drums, and balls to comfort them. The leaders also often send telegrams to tell them to send whatever they need. The soldiers need a lot of things, but they replied: We don't need anything anymore, save materials for the motherland and increase construction strength! The soldiers' parents and lovers also constantly write letters from all over the country, reporting the happy lives of the people in the rear and encouraging the soldiers to defend the motherland well. Yao Sheng, a member of the Communist Youth League and deputy squad leader of the machine gun squad, is from Lijia Village, Wuyu District, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province. His fiancée, Hu Wenjie, is also a member of the Communist Youth League and lives in Suntou Village, two miles away from his home. The two often communicate and encourage each other.

When I left this small island, the soldiers were writing letters to Chairman Mao to celebrate National Day. I saw a young soldier taking advantage of his lunch break, sitting in the shade of a coconut tree to write a letter, with a clean white piece of paper spread out in front of him, holding a pen in his hand, slightly raising his face and looking north across the sea. In that instant, I saw a soldier's true wishes and joy in the eyes of this soldier. This soldier wrote in his letter: "Dear Chairman Mao: Your soldiers are guarding this small island, guarding the national flag planted on the island. We want to make it shine with the national flag in front of Tiananmen Square in Beijing, and forever flutter in the beautiful South China Sea of the motherland!"

    在祖国南海上
    孙景瑞
    国庆节前不久，当我乘船离开海南岛最南端的一个港口，在南海上破浪航行了好几个钟头，快到某岛的时候，突然，船夫指着前面，笑着对我说：“同志，看啊！”我隔着深蓝的海水向远处望去，遥遥看见在长满绿色椰子树的小岛的上空，随风飘扬着一面鲜红的五星国旗。
    这个小岛是祖国南海中星罗棋布的岛屿中间的一个。在国旗下面，人民解放军战士们正日日夜夜警惕地保卫着祖国。
    我怀着兴奋的心情登上了沙滩。沿着“胜利大路”一步一步地向前走去。路旁长满高大的仙人掌和粉红色的小野花。我好像走进了一个童话中的奇境，许多景物和声音使我的眼睛和耳朵都不够用了。当战士们亲热地伸过手来和我握手时，我真找不出一句恰当的话来表达我对战士的热爱，我只是这样说：“同志们辛苦了！”这时，我听到一片雄壮而坚定的回答声：“为人民服务！” 
    我在岛上和战士们一起生活的每一天，都深刻地感到每个战士都在忠实地实践着他们的英雄的誓言。
    当战士们初到这个小岛上的时候，在这个没有人烟的荒岛上，野草蔽人，荆棘丛生，半尺多长的蜈蚣、能在草叶上飞走的四脚蛇、指甲大小的火蝎子等满地乱爬。然而，我们的战士们却决心要把这个荒岛建设成一个美丽的花园。
    没有房子住，战士们就冒着热带特有的暴风骤雨，割草、伐木，搭起了成片的草房；把椰子叶编成帘子，搭起了凉棚。过了不到一个月，战士们在房屋的四周又开辟了花园，在花园里用各种贝壳摆成巨大的五角星，栽植起十字花、龙舌兰等各种鲜艳的热带花草，战士们给它起了一个名字叫“和平花园”。又过了不久，岛上又出现了一块一块的田地，地上长满了秧蔓长长的倭瓜、结得像皮球一样的紫茄子，还有白菜、辣椒等其他菜蔬。同时，岛上也听到了犬吠，看到了在山坡上低头吃草的黄牛；漫山遍野可以寻找到许多的鸡蛋，任何一个泥塘里都有滚得满身泥浆的肥猪。另外，战士们还常从海里抓些虾蟹，吃点“海味”；放哨回来在椰子林荫下饱饱地吸吮一顿甜蜜的椰汁。用战士的话来说：“我们在岛上安了家！”战士们就在门前的高地上竖起了木杆，高高地升起了一面五星国旗。
    在我来到岛上的几天前，战士们的“家”被一场罕见的猛烈的台风“一扫光”了。草房被吹倒了，花草菜蔬被吹没了，鸡和猪的眼睛被沙子打瞎了。于是，战士们立刻对自然带来的灾害展开斗争。他们在火毒的太阳下，仅用三天时间就重新盖起了全部房屋，而且更高大更坚固了；他们又重新开辟了“和平花园”和田地，种上了更多的花草和菜蔬。曾立过三次大功的战斗英雄、指导员王从典说：“说战士们的生活不苦是假的，可是每个战士精神上却是愉快的。因为他们认识到任务的光荣和战士的责任，所以就产生了克服困难的力量。”
    一天黄昏，我看见一个战士正在海滩上拾贝壳，浪花在他的脚下翻滚着。我走过去问他道：“你拾贝壳做什么？”那个战士扭过脸来郑重地对我说：“我想在这岛上找到最好看的贝壳，寄给毛主席；另外，还要写一封信告诉他老人家我在祖国的什么地方！”他的纯朴的愿望使人感到我们的战士们多么可爱，于是我笑着对他说：“毛主席是知道你在这个岛上的！”他立刻愉快地说：“他老人家也知道我吗？”……这时，我看到了那个战士的脸上散发出动人的光彩，像东方的朝霞一样美丽。
    虽然远隔着大山大海，战士们的心却日日夜夜在毛主席的身边。南海上一个静静的夜晚，月亮挂在高空，照耀得海洋像一块透明的水晶。这时，我跟几个战士一起坐在椰子树下谈天，我向他们说：不久前我曾见到过毛主席，他老人家的身体非常健康。战士们听了都非常兴奋。当他们知道我今年国庆节还要到北京去的时候，一个战士马上对我说：“你见了毛主席，可别忘了把岛上的情形告诉他！”另一个说：“你告诉他老人家放心吧！让祖国人民安心建设吧！有我们守住这里，帝国主义就进不了祖国的大门！”
    蒙华君是个二十岁的年轻的战士、优秀的青年团员。有一次，我和他谈话，他在谈话中非常严肃地说：“为了保卫祖国，只要我能够呼吸，就不许敌人踏上我们祖国的一寸土地！”我问他：“可是什么是祖国呢？”蒙华君一点也不犹豫地把脚往地上一跺，答道：“这就是祖国！”——我们的战士就是这样地可爱！
    战士们有决心和信心把小岛变成祖国的钢铁堡垒。他们不管热带的太阳晒得皮肤像针刺的一样疼，不管沙土烫脚，也不管台风和暴雨，勤劳地建设祖国的海岛。岛上的战士经常拿志愿军在朝鲜克服困难的精神，拿在康藏高原上修筑公路的勇士们的事迹，拿兄弟部队在东山岛歼灭蒋匪军的胜利来鼓励自己。他们共同的誓言是：克服困难，保卫海岛，保卫祖国的经济建设！
    小岛虽然远离祖国大陆，交通不便，可是守卫这个岛的部队时时刻刻都受着祖国人民的关怀和支援。各级首长不但经常亲自过海来看望他们，还常派电影队来演电影，还送了许多手风琴、收音机、三弦、锣鼓和球类等来慰问他们。首长们更常常打电报告诉他们，他们需要什么就送什么来。战士们需要的东西很多，可是他们这样回答：我们不需要什么了，为祖国节约物资，增加建设力量！战士们的父母和爱人也不断地从各地写信来，报告后方人民的幸福生活，鼓励战士们好好保卫祖国。青年团员、机枪班副班长姚生是黑龙江省绥化县五区李家村人，他的未婚妻胡文杰也是一个青年团员，住在离他家二里远的孙头村，两人经常通信，互相鼓励。
    当我离开这个小岛的时候，战士们为了迎接国庆节，正在纷纷给毛主席写信。我看见一个年轻的战士利用中午休息时间，坐在椰子树荫下写信，他的面前铺着一张洁白的纸，手里拿着一只钢笔，微微地仰着脸，隔着海向北方望着。在那一瞬间，我从这个战士的眼睛里看到了一个战士的真正的愿望和喜悦。这位战士在信上写着：“亲爱的毛主席：您的战士们正保卫着这个小岛，保卫着插在岛上的一面国旗，我们要使它和北京天安门前的那面国旗互相辉映，永远飘扬在祖国的美丽的南海上！”
