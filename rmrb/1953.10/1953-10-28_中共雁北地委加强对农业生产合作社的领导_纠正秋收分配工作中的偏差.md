    The CPC Yanbei Prefectural Committee Strengthens Leadership Over Agricultural Production Cooperatives and Corrects Deviations in Autumn Harvest Distribution Work
    The autumn harvest work in the Yanbei Special District of Shanxi Province is nearing completion. Counties have generally paid close attention to the distribution issues within agricultural production cooperatives during the autumn harvest. The majority of the ninety-six agricultural production cooperatives in the entire special district have developed relatively practical distribution plans. Dazong, Ying County, Shanyin, Shuoxian and other places also dispatched twenty-eight capable cadres to various cooperatives to assist with the autumn harvest distribution. As a result, the distribution work in various cooperatives is generally proceeding smoothly.
    The main problems discovered in the autumn harvest distribution are: First, the compensation for land and means of production in some agricultural production cooperatives is too low, ignoring the principle that land should receive reasonable compensation. In Hunyuan County, out of fourteen agricultural production cooperatives, except for Qiaomai Chuan and Xihe, the land rent in the remaining twelve cooperatives is low. In the Jiupei Village agricultural production cooperative, the grain rent for 340 mu of land accounted for 12.5 percent of the total income of 160,000 jin of grain, and it is estimated that it accounts for less than 20 percent of the net income. In the Qinzhuang agricultural production cooperative of Ying County, the four households with more land and less labor received 3% to 6% less this year than last year, while the thirteen households with less land and more labor received 23% to 300% more this year than last year. Obviously, this would disadvantage farmers with less labor and more land. Second, a few agricultural production cooperatives have an excessively large proportion of distribution from production investment, reducing labor income and creating the phenomenon of "increased production but less actual income." For example, in the Chenjiabao agricultural production cooperative in Yanggao, the distribution of means of production accounted for 92.2 percent, while the labor distribution accounted for only 7.8 percent, with each labor day receiving only 870+ yuan, which disadvantaged farmers with more labor and fewer means of production (this situation has been corrected). The reason for this situation is the incorrect expansion of production investment interest, such as paying interest on inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, and fodder, and even having the cooperative uniformly pay wages for the autumn耕地 when joining the cooperative last year. Although counties have already paid attention to this issue, there is still a lack of inspection of each cooperative, and concrete problems have not been earnestly and meticulously resolved. Some counties even rely solely on the cadres stationed in the cooperatives without sending people to provide concrete assistance, thus failing to grasp the overall situation and resolve various specific problems, affecting the consolidation, improvement, and development of agricultural production cooperatives.
    After studying the above situation, the CPC Yanbei Prefectural Committee has instructed all counties to take appropriate measures to solve the existing problems.
    The instructions first require all counties to conduct a comprehensive inspection of each agricultural production cooperative to understand whether the total income of each cooperative has increased compared with previous years and the reasons for this. They should go deep into each cooperative to investigate the income of poor and middle peasants, to see whether their income has increased compared with previous years, and whether they have all received appropriate benefits and have largely satisfied their distribution requirements. When leading agricultural production cooperatives in distribution work, the originally established distribution ratio should be reviewed, that is, whether the proportion of production investment and labor dividends is appropriate. If it is inappropriate, it should be appropriately revised after educating the members based on the actual local situation. However, major changes should be approved by the county party committee. When carrying out the distribution work of agricultural production cooperatives, it is necessary to carefully check whether the preparatory work is complete, and any confusion in accounts and work points should be quickly clarified. Shortcomings in democracy, finance, and labor management within the cooperative should be checked and corrected through distribution work.
    The instructions finally stated that during the autumn harvest distribution process of agricultural production cooperatives, the party's political and ideological work must be strengthened, and in particular, members must be educated on the concept of collectivism and the policy of voluntary mutual benefit, criticizing the idea of absolute egalitarianism, so as to further consolidate and improve the cooperative through distribution work. For cooperatives with chaotic internal situations that cannot be consolidated, the county party committee should help them solve outstanding problems and steadily transform them into mutual aid teams.

### 中共雁北地委加强对农业生产合作社的领导  纠正秋收分配工作中的偏差

    中共雁北地委加强对农业生产合作社的领导
    纠正秋收分配工作中的偏差
    山西省雁北专区的秋收工作已将结束。秋收中各县对农业生产合作社的分配问题都比较重视。全专区九十六个农业生产合作社，其中大部都做出了比较实际的分配方案。大同、应县、山阴、朔县等地还派了得力干部二十八名，分赴各社帮助进行秋收分配。因而目前各社分配工作一般进行比较顺利。
    从秋收分配中发现的主要问题是：一、有一些农业生产合作社的土地及生产资料的报酬偏低，忽视了土地应取合理报酬的原则。浑源全县十四个农业生产合作社，除乔麦川和西河二社外，其余十二个社地租都低；旧裴村农业生产合作社有地三百四十亩，谷租占总收入十六万斤的百分之十二点五，估计占纯收入也不到百分之二十；应县秦庄农业生产合作社土地多劳力少的四户，今年比去年少收百分之三至百分之六，土地少劳力多的十三户则今年比去年多收百分之二十三至百分之三百，显然，这会使劳力少土地多的农民吃亏。二、有少数农业生产合作社生产投资所得的分配比例过大，劳动收入减少，造成“增产多，实际收入少”的现象。如阳高陈家堡农业生产合作社生产资料分配占百分之九十二点二，劳力分配只占百分之七点八，每个劳动日只分八百七十多元，使得劳力多生产资料少的农民吃亏（这一情况已纠正）。造成这种情况的原因，是因为不正确地扩大了生产投资利息，如对肥料、籽种、草料等垫本也实行作价付息，甚至把去年入社时的秋耕地也由社内统一付耕地的工资。目前各县对这一问题虽然已经引起重视，但还缺乏逐社检查，还没有认真、细致地解决具体问题，甚至有的县只依靠住社干部而不派人去具体帮助，因而不能掌握全面情况和解决各种具体问题，影响了农业生产合作社的巩固、提高和发展。
    中共雁北地委对以上情况进行研究后，已经指示各县采取适当措施，解决存在的问题。
    指示中首先要求各县把各个农业生产合作社进行一次全面的检查，了解各社总收入是否比往年增加，原因何在。应深入到每一个社内，调查贫农、中农的收入情况，看是否比往年的收入增加了，是否都得到适当利益和大体上满足了他们的分配要求。在领导农业生产合作社进行分配工作时，应审查一下原订的分配比例，即生产投资和劳力分红比例是否适当。如有不适当的，即应根据当地实际情况，教育社员作适当修正。但重大的改变，应经县委批准。进行农业生产合作社的分配工作时，要认真检查准备工作是否完备，账目、计工上混乱的，即应迅速澄清，并通过分配工作检查和纠正社内民主、财务、劳动管理上的缺点。
    指示中最后说，在农业生产合作社秋收分配过程中，必须加强党的政治思想工作，特别要对社员进行关于集体观念和自愿两利的政策教育，批评绝对平均主义的思想，以通过分配工作，使社进一步巩固提高。对社内情况太混乱，不能巩固的社，县委应帮助他们解决遗留问题，稳步转为互助组。
