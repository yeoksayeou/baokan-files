Xinhua News Agency: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army held a grand meeting on October 27th at the Volunteer Army leadership organs to commemorate the third anniversary of going abroad to fight. More than 5,000 people attended the meeting.

　　The meeting was held in an open-air square. The newly built rostrum was decorated with red cloth, and a huge "Resist America, Aid Korea" commemorative medal was hung high in front of the stage. On both sides, the heroic weapons of the Volunteer Army and spoils of war such as artillery and tanks were arranged.

　　The meeting was presided over by General Zhang Nansheng, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

　　When General Deng Hua, Deputy Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, General Yang Dezhi, and Chief of Staff Li Da accompanied Kim Du-bong, Chairman of the Korean Democratic People's Republic Government Awarding Medal Delegation, Kang Ryang-uk, Secretary-General, Park Ui-wan, Deputy Prime Minister, Head of the Korean Democratic People's Republic Government Delegation to Congratulate the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Third Anniversary of Going Abroad to Fight, and He Long, Head of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, onto the rostrum, they were warmly welcomed by those present.

　　The meeting began with the solemn playing of the national anthems of China and North Korea and the sound of salutes.

　　General Deng Hua, Deputy Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and General He Long, Head of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, delivered speeches at the meeting (the full texts are on page 3 of today's newspaper). Subsequently, Park Ui-wan, Deputy Prime Minister and Head of the Korean Government Delegation to Congratulate the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Third Anniversary of Going Abroad to Fight, delivered a congratulatory speech at the meeting. He said: The Korean people will never forget the immortal achievements and merits of the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean battlefield, and our descendants for generations to come will always be grateful to you. He said that in the difficult days when the Korean people were fighting against the armed aggression of the American and British imperialists, the Chinese people sent a strong Volunteer Army to assist us. This not only represents the friendly relations historically forged between the Chinese and Korean peoples, but also serves as a practical example of noble internationalist mutual solidarity. When Deputy Prime Minister Park Ui-wan spoke about the Korean people's confidence in victory in the post-war economic reconstruction, he said: The people of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other People's Democratic countries are providing us with the greatest assistance in our Korean post-war construction work. This assistance is a solid guarantee for the Korean people to strive for victory in the cause of building a prosperous motherland. He concluded by saying: Today, as the Korean people welcome the third anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the War to Resist America and Aid Korea, we once again extend our infinite respect and gratitude to the brotherly Chinese People's Volunteer Army and Chairman Mao Zedong. At the same time, the unbreakable friendship between the two peoples will become even deeper and more consolidated. The Korean people will do their best to give the Chinese People's Volunteer Army all kinds of support and assistance.

　　Kim Hwa-seon, Chairman of a certain mine committee of the Korean People's Representatives Labor Party, spoke at the meeting. He said: All the staff and workers of the mine have sworn to our beloved leader, Marshal Kim Il-sung, that in the struggle to restore the post-war people's economic construction, we will celebrate the 36th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the 3rd anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the war with greater labor achievements. At present, the entire mine has completed the annual production plan seventy-one days ahead of schedule. We must make greater efforts to strive for greater victories.

　　Before the closing of the conference, representatives of the Korean People's Army and the Provisional Capital of the Korean Democratic People's Republic, Pyongyang, presented a banner to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The front of the banner read: "Celebrating the Third Anniversary of the Great Chinese People's Volunteer Army's Participation in the War," and the back read: "Long Live the China-North Korea Friendship United by Blood!"
