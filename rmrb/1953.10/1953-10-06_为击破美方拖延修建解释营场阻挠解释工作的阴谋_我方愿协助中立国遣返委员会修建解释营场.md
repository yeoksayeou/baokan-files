Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 5th. The Korean-Chinese side delegation to the Military Armistice Commission issued the following communiqué on the 5th:

    The explanation work conducted by both sides of the Korean Armistice Agreement to all non-directly repatriated prisoners of war dependent on their respective sides has not yet begun, due to the extremely unreasonable delaying tactics adopted by the U.S. side in the construction of explanation enclosures.
    Regarding the construction of explanation enclosures, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has long requested that both sides expedite the construction in accordance with the principle of respecting the requests made by the explaining party regarding the location and design of the explanation enclosures. The Korean-Chinese side has, in accordance with the aforementioned request of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, constructed all the equipment for the explanation enclosure for the U.S. side's use at the location designated by the U.S. side and according to the U.S. side's design. However, the U.S. side has not yet begun to construct any equipment for the explanation enclosure for the Korean-Chinese side's use at the location designated by the Korean-Chinese side and according to the Korean-Chinese side's design, in accordance with the request of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. In order to enable the explanation work to begin quickly, the Korean-Chinese side suggested to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on September 30th that the U.S. side could first construct the most necessary equipment at the location designated by the Korean-Chinese side, including twenty explanation tents, which could be erected within twenty-four hours. However, the U.S. side has delayed even the construction of these extremely simple facilities. Not only that, but according to the communiqué issued by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on October 4th, the U.S. side even indicated to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission that it had not yet determined whether it was willing to undertake its obligation to build the explanation enclosures as required by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and claimed that even if it decided to undertake this obligation, it would take seven days after undertaking this obligation to erect twenty tents; and it would take four weeks after deciding to undertake this obligation to complete the entire explanation enclosure. This blatant delaying tactic is intolerable.
    At present, the U.S. side is delaying the construction of the explanation enclosures on the one hand, making it impossible for the explanation work to begin. On the other hand, it is unreasonably insisting that the explanation period must end on December 24th. The U.S. side fully understands that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has the responsibility to ensure the right of the explanation representatives to conduct explanations to the prisoners of war within ninety days and the right of the prisoners of war to listen to the explanations within ninety days. In order to fulfill this responsibility, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission determined on September 24th that the explanation period should be extended accordingly if the explanation work is delayed to begin, and has twice requested the U.S. side to agree to this principle. Now that the U.S. side neither expedites the construction of the explanation enclosures as required by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, nor opposes the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's decision to extend the explanation period, it is clearly in order to shorten the explanation period, infringe upon the right of the explanation representatives to conduct explanations and the right of the prisoners of war to listen to the explanations, and make it impossible for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to it within the scope of its authority. The explanation enclosure built by the Korean-Chinese side according to all the requirements put forward by the U.S. side at the request of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, has been officially taken over by the Indian custodial troops of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on October 5th. In view of the fact that the U.S. side flagrantly disregards the provisions of the Armistice Agreement and openly refuses to undertake the obligation to build the explanation enclosures, so as to delay this construction indefinitely, the Korean-Chinese side has requested the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to immediately take measures to independently resolve this construction issue. The Korean-Chinese side further stated that in this construction work, the Korean-Chinese side is willing to provide all necessary assistance to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The delay in the explanation period caused by the repeated obstruction of the U.S. side must be extended in accordance with the method proposed by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

    为击破美方拖延修建解释营场阻挠解释工作的阴谋
    我方愿协助中立国遣返委员会修建解释营场
    【新华社开城五日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面代表团五日发表公报如下：
    朝鲜停战双方向一切依附其本方的不直接遣返的战俘所进行的解释工作，由于美方在修建解释营地的工作上继续采取极端无理的拖延态度，迄今尚未开始。
    关于解释营地的修建，中立国遣返委员会早已要求双方按照解释营场的地点与设计尊重解释一方所提要求的原则加紧进行。朝中方面已根据中立国遣返委员会的上述要求，在美方所指定的地点，按照美方的设计，修建好供美方使用的解释营场之一切设备。但美方则迄未根据中立国遣返委员会的要求，在朝中方面所指定的地点，按照朝中方面的设计，开始修建供朝中方面使用的解释营场之任何设备。为使解释工作得以迅速开始，朝中方面在九月三十日曾向中立国遣返委员会建议可由美方在朝中方面所指定的地点先行修建最必要的设备，包括二十个解释帐篷，这是完全可以在二十四小时内搭好的。但美方连这些极简单的设备，也拖延不着手修建。不但如此，根据中立国遣返委员会在十月四日所发表的公报，美方甚至向中立国遣返委员会表示，它尚未确定是否愿按照中立国遣返委员会的要求承担其修建解释营场的义务，而且声称即使它决定承担此项义务，也要在承担此项义务的七天以后，才能搭好二十个帐篷；并须在决定承担此项义务的四个星期后，才能修好整个解释营场。这种明目张胆的拖延手段，是令人不能容忍的。
    目下美方正一面拖延解释营场的修建，使解释工作无法开始。一面又无理主张解释期限至十二月二十四日即须结束。美方完全了解：中立国遣返委员会负有责任保证解释代表在九十天的时间内向战俘进行解释的权利以及战俘在九十天的时间内听取解释的权利。中立国遣返委员会为了履行这一责任，曾于九月二十四日确定了解释工作推迟开始则解释期限亦应顺延的原则，并曾两度要求美方同意这一原则。如今美方既不按照中立国遣返委员会的要求，加紧修建解释营场，又反对中立国遣返委员会关于解释期限顺延的决定。这显然是为了要缩短解释期限，侵犯解释代表进行解释以及战俘听取解释的权利，并使中立国遣返委员会无法履行中立国遣返委员会职权范围所赋予该委员会的职责。朝中方面根据中立国遣返委员会的请求，按照美方提出的全部要求所修建的解释营场，已在十月五日正式交由中立国遣返委员会印度看管部队接管。鉴于美方悍然不顾停战协定的规定，公开表示拒绝承担修建解释营场的义务，以无限期拖延此项修建，朝中方面已要求中立国遣返委员会立即采取措施，自行负责解决此项修建问题。朝中方面并表示在此项修建工作中，朝中方面愿向中立国遣返委员会提供一切必须的协助。由于美方一再阻挠而产生的解释期限的推迟，必须按照中立国遣返委员会所提出的办法予以顺延。
