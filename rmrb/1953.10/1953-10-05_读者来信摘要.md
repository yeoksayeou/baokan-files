Reader's Letters Abstract

Fully Utilize All Possibilities to Strive to Increase Crop Yields

Editor's Note: Actively leading and organizing the broad masses of farmers to use various methods to increase this year's crop yields is a major task in current rural work. The following abstracts of four letters illustrate that many crops are already ripe or being harvested. As long as we can fully utilize all possibilities for increased production and avoid even the most "minor" losses during the autumn harvest, we can increase crop yields. In addition, strengthening field management of late autumn crops such as buckwheat and striving to grow a variety of vegetables can also increase this year's crop production. Party and government leading organs and rural work cadres at all levels should pay close attention to this issue, using typical demonstrations and detailed accounting methods to educate farmers so that they understand the benefits of increasing crop yields for individuals and the country, and consciously seek various ways to strive to increase this year's crop yields.

Jiangsu Dafeng County Herui Township Cotton Farmers

Actively Prevent Cotton Boll Rot

Letters from readers Shen Fuhua and Xu Hanying, Dafeng County, Jiangsu Province: Cotton fields in our county are generally starting to be picked. However, late-planted cotton and high-yield cotton fields are still lush with green branches and leaves, making them difficult to ventilate and let light in, and the phenomenon of cotton boll rot is very common. This situation will seriously affect the increase in cotton production and the improvement of quality. Initially, farmers had an indifferent attitude towards this phenomenon, thinking that it was nothing to worry about if one or two bolls rotted on a cotton plant. But after this phenomenon became widespread, farmers were distressed because they could not think of a solution. They thought that weeds could be hoed, insects could be treated, but only this boll rot could not be cured.

When the Yang Xinian Mutual Aid Group in Herui Township discovered this situation, they discussed it. Group leader Yang Xinian gave everyone a detailed account: if an average of one boll rots on a cotton plant, and there are 2,500 plants per mu, then 2,500 bolls will rot; with 125 bolls making one jin of cotton, then 20 jin of cotton will rot per mu. Yang Changyou, the party branch secretary of the township, also pointed out: "Good cotton cannot be picked from rotten bolls; if bad cotton is sold to the state, the yarn and cloth spun and woven will not be strong." So everyone's thinking was straightened out, and they actively started to use their brains. After everyone's research, the main reasons for the boll rot are: the cotton branches and leaves are too dense, there is too much firewood and grass on the field banks and ditch edges, the cotton bolls are not easily ventilated, and the red bollworm is also harmful. The main prevention methods are: cutting off the firewood and grass on the field banks and ditch edges, cutting off some of the empty branches and old cotton leaves, and actively catching red bollworms. After the solution was found, everyone's confidence increased and their enthusiasm came. The mutual aid group also divided the labor. Since the cotton bolls are not yet generally spitting lint, it was decided that the elderly and children with weak labor power would pick cotton, and the strong labor power would concentrate on cutting grass, pruning branches, and catching insects. After several days of intense labor, all the 100+ mu of cotton fields in the group were completely trimmed and cut.

This method has been quickly promoted throughout the township. Cotton farmers throughout the township have expressed that they will resolutely prevent cotton boll rot and ensure a good harvest.

Songjiang Huachuan County Second District Farmers

Improve Soybean Harvesting Methods

Letters from readers Yang Yuchun, Wang Jiang, and Li Xuezhong: Yang Yuchun, secretary of the Second District Committee of the CCP Songjiang Province Huachuan County, inspected the autumn harvest work of the Mingxing Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Zhao Haitao Mutual Aid Group in the district. In the soybean fields harvested by the Mingxing Agricultural Production Cooperative, he found that 22 out of 37 soybean stalks had not been harvested cleanly. After everyone's rough calculation, it was estimated that about 237 jin of soybeans were lost per hectare; the cooperative planted 40 hectares of soybeans this year, which would result in a loss of 9,480 jin, enough to buy two large horses. However, because the Zhao Haitao Mutual Aid Group studied autumn harvest methods and harvested in a timely and careful manner, there was very little loss during the harvest. For example, when the group harvested the soybeans of group member Lao Zhai's family, they left out the slightly green leaves on the edge of the field ridge. The soybean leaves in the north depression had not fallen completely and were not fully ripe, while those on the south slope were ripe first, so the group harvested the ones on the slope first.

In order to promote farmers to do a good job in the autumn harvest, the Second District Committee used the production gaps to convene the leaders of the agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in the district to visit the Zhao Haitao Mutual Aid Group's harvesting methods on the spot, and at the same time compared them with the harvesting work of the Mingxing Agricultural Production Cooperative. The people who visited unanimously agreed that the Zhao Haitao Mutual Aid Group's harvesting methods were worth learning. The director of the Dongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative frowned and said at the time: "Our cooperative has been harvesting soybeans for two days. Compared with the Zhao Haitao Mutual Aid Group, we will lose at least 500 more jin of soybeans; we must resolutely correct this phenomenon when we go back." Wang Chunnian, the leader of the Changsheng Village Mutual Aid Group, pointed to the soybean ridges left out and the green soybeans in the depression that had not been harvested during the visit and said: "If we don't want to waste grain, we must do it like them, harvesting one ridge when it is ripe. I will hold a meeting of all the group members tonight and start working tomorrow, we can't wait any longer!" After this visit, the whole district generally improved the soybean harvesting methods and strove to harvest more grain.

Xiaojinren Agricultural Production Cooperative

Pay Attention to Checking the Method of Cutting Grain Ears

Letters from readers Yao Congyi, Gong Linhai, and Qin Xiaoren: The members of the Xiaojinren Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhangjiahe Village, Shuo County, Shanxi Province, are busy threshing grain these days. The women are working very enthusiastically in the field cutting grain ears. However, some people are simply seeking speed, grabbing five or six ears at a time and cutting them off with one knife. Because some of the grains are not bundled very neatly, a few ears are left in the straw; some grain stalks are uneven in height, and a few grain "eggs" (the tail end of the ears) are left on the straw. Xiao Jinren, the director of the cooperative, carefully checked the straw and found that at least three ears were missed in each bundle, and as many as eight were missed in some bundles. However, the members thought: this is a "minor matter", "everyone cuts grain like this." Xiao Jinren inspected all the straw once and found 460 large and small grain ears in the straw from two mu of land, which yielded more than 12 jin of grain. Everyone calculated that the cooperative's 240+ mu of grain this year would lose 1,500 jin. This fact educated the members. Everyone said: if we don't pay attention to this "small problem", we would have almost lost 1,500 jin of grain; we must pay attention everywhere and be careful in everything to increase production and save.

Leading Cadres of Zhaixi District, Tonglu County

Lead Farmers to Strengthen Autumn Field Management

Letters from readers Xu Dejian and Zhou Naiyun, Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province: Leading cadres in Zhaixi District, our county, clearly understand the importance of striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest, and have corrected the thinking of only focusing on leading rice production increases and neglecting striving for bumper harvests of late-maturing crops in previous years. The autumn production situation this year is very different from previous years. While actively leading the masses to overcome natural disasters, the District Committee of the CCP has arranged for cadres to lead the masses to make preparations for timely harvesting and rushing to plant late autumn crops. This year, the district has sown 3,896 mu of buckwheat and grass seeds, three times more than last year. At present, the late autumn crops are growing well. At the same time, farmers also pay attention to autumn field management such as protecting seedlings, replanting seedlings, weeding, insect control, and fertilization. Although there was alternating drought and flood this autumn, which brought new difficulties to autumn field management, the district cadres convened experienced farmers to discuss the management experience of late autumn crops and discovered many good methods. For example, when studying the situation that late planting may be affected by frost, the farmers proposed to carefully cultivate late autumn seedlings, appropriately apply plant ash to increase fertility and heat, promote rapid germination, and use irrigation and smoke to prevent frost. They also organized an inspection of the planted buckwheat and found a shortage of seedlings. They then took remedial measures according to the specific situation, such as digging soil for spot seeding or replanting vegetables. At present, the farmers in the district have a great enthusiasm for striving for a bumper harvest of late autumn crops.

Promote the Spirit of Unity and Mutual Assistance to Solve the Difficulties of Some Farmers Lacking Wheat Seeds

(1)

Letter from reader Xu Busheng: Huachi Township, Sixth District, Hua County, Shaanxi Province, is a mountainous area. Because of the disaster this year, 41 households in the township are short of wheat seeds. After the township cadres of Xuema Township (a high-yield wheat township) in the same district learned about this, they immediately went to Xuema and other five villages to discuss with farmers who had surplus wheat seeds. After the farmers in these five villages understood the principles of unity and mutual assistance and doing a good job in production, they sold about 1,600 jin of wheat seeds. On the morning of September 16, Zhao Kaiyun, the township head of Huachi Township, brought farmers with ropes and bags to transport the wheat seeds. They were unspeakably grateful to the farmers in Xuema Township. They carried the "Bima No. 1" improved variety and "White Wheat" back to Huachi Township and actively prepared to dry, select, and mix the seeds to strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year.

Letters from readers Jia Keqin, Guo Naiqi, and Yang Guicheng: Lijia Gelo Village in Xiazhuang Township, Licheng County, Shanxi Province, is a small mountain village with 12 households. This year, the farmers in this village lacked wheat seeds because the wheat was frozen. After Fan Chunwang, the secretary of the CCP branch in the neighboring Yuancun Village, learned about this situation, he convened a branch meeting to discuss how to help Lijia Gelo Village solve the problem of wheat seeds. The party members unanimously agreed that as long as the masses are mobilized to lend and help each other, the problem can be solved. Fan Chunwang and Guo Ruixing took the lead in lending wheat seeds; in addition to lending wheat, Fan Guangji and Qin Xiaolian also paid the farmers in Lijia Gelo Village with wheat for the wages they helped them cultivate the land. Under the leadership of the party members, many farmers in Yuancun Village also came to help the farmers in Lijia Gelo Village, solving their difficulty in lacking seeds. The farmers in Lijia Gelo Village said: In the old society, large villages suppressed small villages, but under the leadership of the Communist Party, large villages help small villages.

Some Farmers in Pixian County Carefully Select Wheat Seeds

Saving Grain and Ensuring a Bumper Harvest

Letters from Wang Kangjun and Cai Shiyuan, Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry: More than 10% of the wheat seeds in Wuzha Village, Lianhe District, Pixian County, Jiangsu Province, have been damaged by the wheat weevil and will not sprout when sown in the ground. Before planting wheat, local farmers only screened the wheat seeds with a sieve and winnowed them with a dustpan, and could not select the insect-damaged grains. The village plans to sow 1,500 mu of wheat fields this year, sowing 20 jin per mu. If the damaged wheat grains can be selected, 3,000 jin of grain can be saved, and the full seedlings in the wheat fields can be ensured.

After the work team of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry discovered this problem in the village, they immediately mobilized the farmers to select seeds with muddy water. Muddy water selection is to mix 30 jin of clay with 100 jin of clean water to form muddy water, and then put the wheat seeds in and stir gently. Because the muddy water has a large specific gravity, the shriveled, small, and insect-bitten wheat grains will float on the surface and can be scooped out. This not only saves wheat seeds, but also avoids the phenomenon of broken seedlings caused by good wheat being heavy and falling to the ground first during sowing, and bad wheat being light and falling to the ground later; because the insect-damaged wheat grains are selected, the occurrence of wheat nematode disease can also be prevented; the selected good wheat seeds are dried and sown, the seedlings emerge quickly, evenly, and consistently, and there will be no phenomenon of yellow and green, and uneven maturity during harvest. The work cadres of the group publicized the above benefits to the farmers, and personally made samples and taught techniques, so that the method of muddy water selection was quickly promoted, and cadres and farmers from nearby townships also went to visit and learn. Ding Hongxue, an old farmer in Dingchang Village, said when he saw the wheat seeds with damaged germ floating in the muddy water: "With this broken mouth, I knew that it would not sprout before, but I couldn't find a way to select it. Now I have found the way." Under his leadership and influence, the farmers in Dingchang Village selected more than 1,900 jin of wheat seeds in two mornings.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    充分利用一切可能性努力提高农作物收获量
    编者按：积极领导和组织广大农民利用各种办法来提高今年农作物的收获量，是当前农村工作中的一项重大任务。下面摘要发表的四封来信说明：目前不少作物已经成熟或正在收割，只要我们能够充分利用各种增产的可能性，避免在秋收过程中即使是很“细微”的损失，就能提高农作物的收获量。此外，加强对荞麦等晚秋作物的田间管理和争取多种蔬菜等，也能使我们增加今年农作物的产量。各地党政领导机关和农村工作干部应该十分重视这个问题，用典型示范和算细账的办法，来教育农民，使他们认识提高农作物收获量对个人、对国家的利益，自觉地想各种办法来为提高今年农作物的收获量而努力。
    江苏大丰县和瑞乡棉农
    积极防治棉花烂果现象
    江苏省大丰县读者沈福华、徐汉英来信：我县棉田正普遍开始拾花。但晚种棉花和丰产田的棉花还是青枝绿叶，相当茂盛，不易通风、透光，棉果霉烂现象很普遍。这个情况将严重影响棉花的增产和质量的提高。起初农民对这种现象抱着无所谓态度，认为一棵棉花烂掉个把果子没什么了不起。但这种现象普遍发生后，农民即苦于想不出办法，认为草可以锄、虫可以治、独有这烂果子没法治。
    和瑞乡杨喜年互助组发现这一情况时，就进行了讨论。组长杨喜年向大家算了细账：如果一棵棉花平均烂掉一个果子，一亩田以两千五百棵计算，就要烂掉两千五百个果子；以一百二十五个果子合一斤花，那么一亩田就要烂掉二十斤棉花。该乡党支部书记杨长友也指出：烂果子就拾不到好花；坏花卖给国家，纺的纱、织的布都不结实。于是大家思想搞通了，就积极动起脑筋来。经大家研究，烂果子的主要原因是棉花枝叶太密和田岸沟边柴草多、棉果子不易通风透气，还有红铃虫为害。防治办法主要是：割去田岸沟边柴草，把空枝和老棉叶剪去一部分，并积极捕捉红铃虫。办法想出来后，大家信心高了，劲头也来了。互助组又在劳力上进行了分工，目前棉果吐絮尚不普遍，决定劳力弱的老人、小孩拾花，劳力强的突击割草、剪枝和捉虫。经过了几天的紧张劳动，全组一百多亩棉田全部整割完了。
    这一办法已经很快在全乡推广了。全乡棉农都表示要坚决防治棉花烂果，保证丰收。
  松江桦川县二区农民
    改善收割大豆的方法
    读者杨玉春、王江、李学忠来信：中共松江省桦川县二区区委书记杨玉春同志检查了该区明星农业生产合作社及赵海涛互助组的秋收工作。他在明星农业生产合作社割过的大豆田中，发现三十七棵豆槎当中就有二十二颗豆荚没有收净。经大家粗略计算，估计每垧约损失大豆二百三十七斤；全社今年种的四十垧大豆，就要损失九千四百八十斤，可买两匹大马。但赵海涛互助组因为研究了秋收方法，收割及时而仔细，因此收割中损失很少。如该组收割组员老翟家的大豆时，就把田垄边叶子稍青的留了出来。北洼兜的豆叶没落净不太熟，南岗的先熟了，该组就先割了岗上的。
    二区区委员会为了推动农民做好秋收工作，就利用生产空隙时间，召集全区农业生产合作社和互助组的领导人实地参观赵海涛互助组的收割方法，同时又和明星农业生产合作社的收割工作作了对比。参观的人一致认为，赵海涛互助组的收割方法是值得学习的。东兴农业生产合作社主任当时就紧皱着眉头说：“我们社里割了两天豆子，如和赵海涛互助组比，最少要多损失五百斤豆子；回去要坚决纠正这种现象。”长胜屯互助组长王春年在参观时指着留出来的边垄豆子和洼兜里没割的青豆说：“要想不糟损粮食，必须像人家这样，熟一垄，割一垄。我回去晚上开个全体组员会，明天就动手干，可不能再等啦！”经过这次参观，全区普遍改善了收割大豆方法，争取多打粮食。
    萧进仁农业生产合作社
    注意检查切谷穗的方法
    读者姚从义、龚临海、秦效仁来信：山西省朔县张家河村萧进仁农业生产合作社的社员们，这几天正在紧张地打谷。妇女们上场切谷穗，工作热情很高。但是，有的人单纯求快，一把抓起五、六个穗子一刀就切下来。因为有的谷子捆得不很整齐，少数穗子就遗留在谷草里了；有的谷秆高低不齐，少数谷蛋蛋（穗子尾端）就留在谷草上了。该社社长萧进仁仔细检查了谷草，发现每捆最少漏下三个穗子，多的漏下八个。但社员们认为：这是“毫毛小事”，“谁家切谷也是这样”。萧进仁就把全部谷草检查了一次，结果在二亩地的谷草中就找出大小谷穗四百六十个，共打了十二斤多谷。大家一算账，今年全社二百四十多亩谷，损失就会有一千五百斤。这个事实教育了社员们，大家说：如果不注意这个“小问题”，几乎把一千五百斤谷子丢了；增产节约必须处处注意、事事留神才行。
    桐庐县窄溪区领导干部
    领导农民加强秋田管理
    浙江省桐庐县读者徐德健、周乃筠来信：我县窄溪区领导干部明确地认识了争取全面丰收的重要意义，纠正了往年只重视领导水稻增产而忽视争取后熟作物丰收的思想，今年晚秋的生产情况与往年大不相同。该区中共区委员会在积极领导群众战胜自然灾害的同时，就布置干部领导群众做好及时收割和抢种晚秋作物的准备工作。今年全区已经播种荞麦和草籽三千八百九十六亩，比去年扩大了三倍。目前晚秋作物生长良好。同时，农民还重视了保苗补苗、除草除虫、施肥等秋田管理工作。今年秋季虽然旱涝交错，给秋田管理带来了新的困难；但区干部召集了有经验的农民座谈晚秋作物的管理经验，发现了不少好办法。如在研究下种晚可能受霜灾这一情况时，农民们就提出了加意培育晚秋禾苗，适当施草木灰、增加肥力和热度，促使发苗快，以及灌水、薰烟等防霜办法。对已种植的荞麦，曾组织了一次检查，发现缺苗现象，他们就根据具体情况采取挖土点播或补种菜蔬等方法来补救。目前全区的农民对力争晚秋作物丰收的劲头很大。
    发扬团结互助精神解决部分农民缺麦种的困难
    （一）
    读者徐步升来信：陕西省华县六区灰池乡是山地，因为今年有灾情，全乡有四十一户农民缺少小麦种籽。同区薛马乡（小麦丰产乡）乡干部知道了这件事情后，马上就到薛马等五个村和有多余麦种的农民商量。这五个村的农民在了解到团结互助、搞好生产的道理后，就卖出了一千六百斤左右麦种。九月十六日早上，灰池乡赵开运乡长带着农民拿了绳索、口袋来搬运麦种，见了薛马乡的农民有说不出的感激。他们把“碧玛一号”良种和“白麦种”担回了灰池乡，积极准备晒种、选种和拌种，以争取明年小麦丰收。
    （二）
    读者贾克勤、郭乃奇、杨贵成来信：山西省黎城县霞庄乡李家圪罗村是个十二户农民的小山庄。今年这个村子的农民因为小麦遭冻而缺麦种。临近的元村中共分支部书记范春旺知道这个情况后，就召开分支部大会商议如何帮助李家圪罗村解决小麦种籽问题。党员们一致认为：只要发动群众互借互济，就能解决问题。范春旺、郭锐兴等都带头借出麦种；范广吉、秦小连除了借出小麦外，还把李家圪罗村农民帮他们耕地的工资米折付麦子。元村不少农民在党员带动下，也都来帮助李家圪罗村农民，解决了他们缺种的困难。李家圪罗村农民都说：旧社会大村压小村，共产党领导下大村帮小村。
    邳县部分农民精选麦种
    节约下粮食又能保证丰收
    江苏省农林厅王康俊、蔡士元来信：江苏省邳县莲河区吴闸村有百分之十以上的麦种胚芽被象鼻虫咬坏了，播在地里不会出苗。当地农民在种麦前仅仅把麦种用筛子筛筛和簸箕扬一下，无法选出受虫害的麦粒。全村今年计划播种一千五百亩麦田，每亩播种二十斤。如果能把受害的麦粒选出来，就能节省三千斤粮食，又能保证麦田的全苗。
    江苏省农林厅工作组在该村发现这一问题后，立即发动农民进行泥水选种。泥水选种是用清水一百斤放胶泥三十斤拌和成泥水，然后放入麦种轻轻捣拌，由于泥水比重大，就使瘪的、细小的、虫咬的麦粒都漂在上面，可以捞出来。这样不但节约了麦种，还可以避免因好麦子重，耩时先掉下地，坏麦子轻，耩时后掉下地而产生的断苗现象；因受虫害的麦粒被选出，又可以防治小麦腺虫病的发生；选出的好麦种晒干后播种，出苗较快、匀壮一致，收割时也不会产生黄的黄、青的青，成熟期不一的现象了。该组工作干部给农民宣传了以上的好处，并亲自做出样子、传授技术，使泥水选种的办法很快地推广开了，连附近各乡的干部、农民也都去参观学习。丁长村老农丁洪学看到芽胚被咬坏的麦种在泥水里漂起来时说：“就这个破嘴子，在先俺也知道不能出苗，可就没法选出来，现在找到门了。”丁长村全村农民在他的带头和影响下，两个上午就选出了一千九百多斤麦种。
