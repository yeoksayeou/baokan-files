    Shandong, Shanxi and Other Provinces Commence New Cotton Procurement
    High Concentration of Cotton on the Market in Some Areas Requires Vigorous Promotion of Seasonal Cotton Price Differences
    Cooperative societies in cotton-producing areas of Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, and other provinces have successively begun procuring new cotton.
    In regions where cotton matures early in these cotton-producing provinces, new cotton appeared on the market as early as late August and early September. Currently, cooperative societies in all cotton-producing areas have universally begun procuring new cotton. Before the start of the new cotton procurement work, these provinces had made appropriate arrangements for cotton procurement funds, supply materials, warehouses, transportation, and processing capacity. Shandong and Shaanxi provinces trained a group of personnel to inspect cotton grades. After the new cotton began to be marketed, the Hebei Provincial People's Government specifically stipulated and announced the seasonal price differences for purchasing new cotton in various parts of the province for early September and November 1st.
    This year, these cotton-producing provinces have paid attention to the supply of materials to the cotton-producing areas. The Shandong Provincial Cooperative Federation and the Shandong Provincial Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company have shipped 1.3 million bolts of cloth to various cotton-producing areas. The Shaanxi Provincial Cooperative Federation has prepared over 1,300 tons of various commodity fertilizers; cooperative societies in Xianyang, Chang'an, and other counties have supplied cotton farmers with a large number of harrows, ploughshares, as well as carrying baskets and mats for harvesting and drying cotton. Many grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in Handan County, Hebei Province, have increased the variety of commodities. While procuring new cotton, they are also supplying fertilizers, coarse grains, cloth, general merchandise, and so on. The currency recovered by the Congzhong Grassroots Cooperative in the county from September 9th to 19th accounted for more than 45 percent of the cash released during the same period.
    In some cotton-producing areas of these provinces that have paid attention to promoting seasonal cotton price differences, the cotton marketing situation is relatively normal. Before the Nan Zhengcun Grassroots Cooperative in Handan County, Hebei Province, effectively promoted seasonal cotton price differences, the cotton marketing was very crowded, so that some cotton farmers were vying to sell, arguing with each other, and some could not sell, wasting manpower and animal power. After the grassroots cooperative, in conjunction with district, township, and village cadres, promoted seasonal cotton price differences through blackboard newspapers, rhythmic storytelling, small-scale seminars, and other methods, the cotton marketing situation has become normal. However, at present, in many areas, the cotton marketing is still very crowded. In addition, some areas have insufficient material preparation, with supply imbalances. In some areas, such as Zhangqiu and Guanchao in Shandong Province, speculative private merchants have been found to depress prices to procure new cotton. In Jie County, Shanxi Province, some personnel inspecting cotton grades tend to err on the side of "lower rather than higher" when grading. These issues urgently need to be addressed by various localities.

### 山东山西等省展开收购新棉工作  部分地区棉花上市拥挤需要大力宣传棉花季节差价

    山东山西等省展开收购新棉工作
    部分地区棉花上市拥挤需要大力宣传棉花季节差价
    山东、山西、陕西、河北等省产棉区合作社先后展开收购新棉工作。
    这些产棉省份棉花成熟早的地区，在八月底、九月初即有新棉上市；目前，各产棉区合作社已普遍展开收购新棉工作。在新棉收购工作开始以前，这几省都对收棉资金、供应物资、仓库、运输和加工力量等作了妥善的安排。山东、陕西等省训练了一批检验棉花等级的人员。河北省人民政府在新棉刚开始上市后，具体规定并公布了该省各地九月初和十一月一日收购新棉的季节差价。
    今年这些产棉省份都注意了对产棉区的物资供应工作。山东省合作总社和山东省花纱布公司运往各产棉区的布匹，已有一百三十万匹。陕西省合作总社已准备各种商品肥料一千三百多吨；咸阳、长安等县的合作社供应了棉农大批耙齿、铧及收晒棉花用的担笼和箔子等生产工具。河北省邯郸县许多基层供销合作社都增加了商品品种，一面收购新棉，一面供应肥料、粗粮、布匹、百货等。该县丛中基层合作社在九月九日到十九日回笼的货币，占同时期投放现金的百分之四十五以上。
    这几个省的产棉地区，有些地方注意宣传棉花季节差价，棉花上市情况比较正常。河北省邯郸县南郑村基层合作社在没有很好宣传棉花季节差价以前，棉花上市很拥挤，以致有些棉农互相抢售、争吵，有的卖不出去，浪费了人力、畜力。该基层社结合区、乡、村干部，通过黑板报、快板、小型座谈会等方式宣传棉花季节差价以后，棉花上市情况已趋正常。但是目前有许多地区棉花上市仍很拥挤。另外，有的地区物资准备不足，有供应失调现象。有些地区，如山东省章邱、观朝等地发现投机私商压价收购新棉。山西省解县部分检验棉花等级的人员分级时有“宁低勿高”的偏向。这些问题，亟需各地注意解决。
