    Certain Speculative and Unscrupulous Merchants in Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, Suppress Grades and Prices to Deceitfully Purchase New Cotton from Farmers
    After new cotton came on the market in Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, some speculative private merchants used illegal methods such as suppressing grades and prices to fraudulently purchase new cotton from farmers, seriously harming the interests of the farmers.
    In Pantang, Sandian, Xinchong, Xugu, Gugang and other places in Xinzhou County, there were speculative private merchants who blocked the roads to snap up new cotton. In Sandian District, three private merchants jointly set up "checkpoints" outside the market town and on the streets to snap up cotton. At each checkpoint, they gave farmers different prices, but all were lower than the purchase price of the cooperatives. In Gugang District, five private merchants undermined the state's "superior cotton, superior price" policy, purchasing all seed cotton at the same price, regardless of its grade. The privately-run "Huimin Native Products Purchasing Fifth Group" in Liji District even told the masses: "The cooperatives grade cotton and differentiate between good and bad, but we don't care about good or bad cotton, we buy it all." They did this to undermine the state's policy of "grading and pricing according to quality, superior cotton, superior price," and to sow discord between the masses and the cooperatives. Even worse, speculative merchants in Liji District even disguised themselves as cadres, taking scales to the countryside to fraudulently purchase and order cotton. When poor peasant Huang Popo was picking cotton in the cotton field, she was deceived by a speculative merchant who purchased four catties and two taels of seed cotton, and after "deducting water" and underweighing, only paid her for three catties and two taels of seed cotton. Some speculative private merchants also used the method of bartering goods for goods, raising the price of goods and lowering the price of cotton, to fraudulently purchase new cotton from farmers.
    After discovering the above situation, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Xinzhou County People's Government instructed cadres in various districts to call on farmers to be vigilant, and at the same time, transferred cadres to organize inspection teams to go deep into various districts for inspection, and promptly strengthened market management to stop the illegal activities of speculative private merchants.

    湖北省新洲县某些投机奸商压级压价骗购农民新棉
    湖北省新洲县新棉上市后，有些投机私商用压级、压价等非法手段骗购农民新棉，严重地损害了农民的利益。
    新洲县潘塘、三店、辛冲、徐古、顾岗等地，都有投机私商拦路抢购新棉。三店区有三家私商合伙在集镇外和街头“设卡”抢购，每一道卡子，给农民以不同的价钱，但都低于合作社收购牌价。顾岗区有五家私商，破坏国家“优棉优价”政策，不论籽棉品级高低，都以同一价格购进。李集区私营“惠民土产收购第五组”甚至向群众说：“合作社收花要分好坏、等级，我们不管好花、坏花，一揽子收。”这样来破坏国家“分等论价，优棉优价”的政策，挑拨群众和合作社的关系。更恶劣的是，李集区的投机商人竟伪装干部，带秤下乡，到棉花产地骗购和订购棉花。贫农黄婆婆在棉地拾花时，被投机商人骗购了四斤二两籽花，连“除水”带压秤，只给了三斤二两籽花的钱。有的投机私商还用以货易货的办法，把货价抬高，棉价压低，骗购农民的新棉。
    新洲县人民政府财政经济委员会发现上述情况后，一面指示各区干部号召农民提高警惕，一面抽调干部组织检查组，深入各区进行检查，及时加强市场管理工作，制止投机私商的非法活动。（黄兴安）
