(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th) Special correspondent Wu Min reports: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles declared on the 6th that he was not pleased with any of the actions taken by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. This is the first time Washington has openly exerted pressure on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Dulles's remarks are clearly an encouragement and support for the United Nations Command and the Syngman Rhee clique's heinous activities of colluding from inside and outside the prisoner-of-war camps to abduct large numbers of prisoners of war and undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement.

Dulles did not elaborate on why the actions of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission made him unhappy. An explanation for this can be found in a letter written on the same day by United Nations Commander-in-Chief Clark to the Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, Thimayya. From this letter, written by Clark before his retirement, it can be seen that the U.S. side is so angrily attacking the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission because the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has exposed the fact that the U.S. side did not correctly inform the prisoners of war about the agreement on the prisoner-of-war issue in the Korean Armistice Agreement, and instead a large number of special agents were sent into the prisoner-of-war camps to prevent the prisoners of war from exercising their right to be repatriated. After understanding this fact, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission took necessary steps to inform the prisoners of war of the content of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and formulated the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work" based on the "Terms of Reference."

Of course, this situation is embarrassing for the so-called United Nations Command, not only because it exposes its conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war, but especially because this conspiracy is in danger of complete bankruptcy. This is enough to explain why the United Nations Commander-in-Chief, who has always adopted a "no comment" attitude towards accusations from all sides, is now suddenly angrily speaking out.

Clark denied point by point the facts exposed by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and repeated the old tune already sung by Hamblen, accusing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's "decisions and activities are based on the assumption that the prisoners of war in your custody actually want to be repatriated." According to Clark, these prisoners of war had long ago "voluntarily" decided to "refuse repatriation," and "as long as there is no force or coercion, the vast majority of prisoners of war will adhere to their decision."

Clark's words are not worth refuting. Since the prisoners of war had long ago "voluntarily" decided to "refuse repatriation," why have more than a hundred prisoners of war resolutely demanded repatriation, and more prisoners of war are trying to escape the control of special agents and demand repatriation? Why is Clark not sure enough to say that "all" prisoners of war will "adhere" to their "decision" but only dares to say "the vast majority"? Why does the "United Nations Command insist that these prisoners of war should express their individual will," but at the same time firmly oppose individual explanations and visits to the prisoners of war, and not allow them to express their individual will?

Clark himself knows very well who is using force to coerce prisoners of war, disregard the human rights of prisoners of war, and not allow prisoners of war to express their individual will. Just one fact is enough: Clark should still remember that on May 7, 1952, he was arriving in Tokyo from the United States to replace Ridgway as Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command. On this day, the captured North Korean and Chinese personnel on Geoje Island detained Brigadier General Dodd in order to oppose the U.S. side's bloody massacre and forced "screening," thoroughly exposing the whole truth of the U.S. side's manufacturing of prisoners of war who "refused repatriation." How did Clark handle this "hot potato"? Clark overturned all the promises made by Dodd and Colson to the prisoners of war, and on June 2, 1952, went to Geoje Island with Van Fleet and declared that "the greatest force will be used" to suppress the captured North Korean and Chinese personnel and not allow them to express their willingness to be repatriated. Clark's brutal actions even aroused the indignation of American soldiers. At that time, U.S. Army Sergeant Chess, who was serving in Oldeburg, California, wrote a letter to Clark condemning his treacherous actions as "one of the most disgusting and shameful things done for nationalism and militarism, regardless of moral demands. ... I simply don't understand how you still have the face to see people." Clark's reply to Chess was to notify the U.S. Department of the Army to send Chess to a military court for trial.

Obviously, Clark's demand that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission not use "force and coercion" against prisoners of war is a "thief crying 'stop thief'" trick, the purpose of which is to confuse the world's attention and cover up the fact that the U.S. side is using force and coercion through special agents to prevent prisoners of war from demanding repatriation. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission accused the U.S. side of sending special agents to infiltrate the prisoner-of-war camps and inflict violence on the prisoners of war in a statement on October 2. In his aggressive letter to Thimayya, Clark dared not refute such a sharp accusation, which fully shows how guilty he is! All this proves that the so-called "human rights" and "individual will" in the mouths of the likes of Dulles and Clark have long lost their original meaning and have become broken tools in the U.S. aggressive bloc's arsenal of "Cold War."

Clark repeatedly said that "the Allied Forces will continue to fulfill its obligations to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement and the 'Terms of Reference'." However, everyone knows that the Armistice Agreement and the "Terms of Reference" do not stipulate that the U.S. side has the "obligation" to obstruct the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission from performing its duties, but Clark is working hard to obstruct the work of the Commission. Article 24 of the "Terms of Reference" stipulates that "the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission shall be responsible for the interpretation of this agreement," but Clark said, "We believe that the clear text of the Terms of Reference does not need interpretation." At the same time, Clark and Hamblen have made many distorted interpretations of the clear text of the "Terms of Reference" and want the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to act according to their interpretations. Otherwise, they will shout everywhere that they feel "unhappy," they want to "protest," they want to "oppose," but the more they shout hoarsely, the more thoroughly their ugly faces are exposed.

    为了掩盖美方强迫扣留战俘的可耻目的
    杜勒斯、克拉克信口攻击中立国遣返委员会
   【新华社开城八日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：美国国务卿杜勒斯在六日宣称，他对于中立国遣返委员会所采取的一切行动，并不感到愉快。这是华盛顿方面第一次公开对中立国遣返委员会施行压力。杜勒斯的谈话显然是鼓励和支持联合国军司令部与李承晚集团从战俘营内外里应外合来劫走大批战俘、破坏朝鲜停战协定的罪恶活动。
    中立国遣返委员会的行动为什么会使杜勒斯感到不愉快，杜勒斯没有进一步加以说明。关于这一点的说明可以从同一天联合国军总司令克拉克写给中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅的信里找到。从克拉克在他退休离职之前所写的这封信里可以看出，美方之所以如此恼怒地对中立国遣返委员会进行攻击，是因为中立国遣返委员会揭穿了这样一个事实，这就是：美方并没有把朝鲜停战协定中关于战俘问题的协议正确地告诉战俘，反而有大批特务被派进战俘营来阻止战俘行使他们被遣返的权利。而中立国遣返委员会在了解了这样一个事实以后，就采取必要的步骤，将“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的内容告诉了战俘，并且根据“职权范围”拟订了“解释和访问工作细则”。
    当然，这种情况对于所谓联合国军司令部是难堪的，不但因为这样一来就使它的强迫扣留战俘的阴谋被揭发了出来，尤其因为这个阴谋因此而有彻底破产的危险。这就足以说明为什么一向对于各方面的指责采取“拒绝评论”的态度的联合国军总司令，现在忽然怒气冲冲地出来讲话了。
    克拉克逐点地抵赖中立国遣返委员会所揭发的事实，并且重弹汉布伦已经唱过的老调，指责中立国遣返委员会的“决定和活动是基于这种假定，即：你们看管的战俘实际上都希望遣返”。据克拉克说，这些战俘早就“自愿”决定了“拒绝遣返”的，“只要没有武力和胁迫，绝大多数战俘都将坚持他们的决定”。
    克拉克这些话都是不值一驳的。既然战俘是早就“自愿”决定“拒绝遣返”的，为什么竟然有一百多名战俘已经坚决要求遣返，并且有更多的战俘正在设法逃脱特务的控制而要求遣返呢？为什么克拉克毫无把握地说“绝大多数”战俘都将“坚持”他们的“决定”而不敢说“全部”战俘呢？为什么“联合国军方面坚持应该让这些战俘个人表示他们的意志”，同时却又坚决反对向战俘进行个别解释和访问，不许他们表达他们的个人意志呢？
    克拉克自己知道得很清楚，用武力胁迫战俘，不顾战俘的人权，不许战俘表示他的个人意志的究竟是谁。单举这一个事实就够了：克拉克应该还记得，一九五二年五月七日，他正从美国到达东京准备接替李奇微担任联合国军总司令。在这一天，巨济岛上的朝中被俘人员为了反对美方的血腥屠杀和强迫“甄别”，扣留了杜德准将，彻底揭穿了美方制造“拒绝遣返”的战俘的全部真相。克拉克是怎样处理这一颗“烫手的栗子”的呢？克拉克将杜德和柯尔生向战俘所作的诺言全部推翻，并且在一九五二年六月二日和范佛里特一起赶往巨济岛，宣称“要使用最大的力量”来镇压朝中被俘人员，不许他们表达要求遣返的意愿。克拉克这种残暴的行径，甚至引起了美国军人的愤慨。当时在美国加利福尼亚州奥尔德堡服役的美军中士切斯曾经写信给克拉克，谴责他这种背信弃义的行动是“为了民族主义和军国主义，不顾道德上的要求而干出来的许多最令人厌恶、最可耻的事情之一。……我简直不明白，你怎么还有脸见人”。克拉克给切斯的答复是通知美国陆军部将切斯送交军事法庭审判。
    很明显，克拉克要求中立国遣返委员会不得对战俘使用“武力和胁迫”，是一种“贼喊捉贼”的诡计，其目的是要迷惑全世界的视线，掩饰美方通过特务用武力和胁迫不许战俘要求遣返的事实。中立国遣返委员会曾经在十月二日的声明中指责美方派遣特务混入战俘营，对战俘行施暴力。克拉克在他给蒂迈雅的气势汹汹的信中，对于这样尖锐的指责却一句话也不敢反驳，这充分说明他是何等的作贼心虚！这一切都证明：杜勒斯、克拉克之流嘴里的所谓“人权”、“个人意志”，早已丧失了它们原来的意义，而成为美国侵略集团进行“冷战”的武器库里的破烂家伙了。
    克拉克口口声声说，“联军方面将根据停战协定和‘职权范围’的规定，继续履行它对中立国遣返委员会所负的义务。”但是，大家知道，停战协定和“职权范围”中并没有规定美方有阻挠中立国遣返委员会执行其职务的“义务”，可是克拉克却正在努力阻挠委员会的工作。“职权范围”二十四款规定，“对本协议之解释由中立国遣返委员会负责”，克拉克却说，“我们认为，职权范围的明白文字是不需要解释的”。而同时，克拉克和汉布伦却对“职权范围”的明白文字作了许多歪曲的解释，并且要中立国遣返委员会非照他们的解释办事不可。否则，他们就到处叫喊说他们感到“不愉快”，他们要“抗议”，他们要“反对”，可是他们越是叫喊得声嘶力竭，他们的丑恶嘴脸也就暴露得越彻底。
