(I)
    After achieving revolutionary victory, the Chinese people began a new era, that of gradually transitioning to socialism.

    On the road to the great goal of socialism, the Chinese people have now begun the planned construction of the national economy. The most important task of the Chinese Communists and the people of the whole country is to develop our country's socialist industry in a planned way, promote the cooperation of agriculture and handicrafts, and transform our country from a backward agricultural country into a socialist industrial-agricultural country. Only through the planned economy and the correct guidance of the development of the national economy can we achieve these complex and enormous tasks.

    In the short period since the founding of the People's Republic of China, great victories have been achieved on all fronts, creating the necessary conditions for the planned economy of the national economy. Due to the completion of democratic social reforms on a national scale, the remnants of domestic imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism have been eliminated, the level of consciousness and organization of the working masses and other working people has been raised, and the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class has been greatly consolidated. Due to the victory of economic recovery work, the productive forces of our country's industry and agriculture, especially the productive forces of modern industry, have been greatly improved, and the main products of industry and agriculture have exceeded the highest annual output level in Chinese history; in the process of economic recovery, the proportion of the socialist state-owned economy has greatly increased, establishing the leading position of the state-owned economy in the national economy; with the recovery and development of the economy, the state's fiscal revenue and expenditure have been balanced, prices have stabilized, and people's lives have been initially improved.

    The great victories achieved by the Chinese people are inseparable from the selfless assistance of the great ally, the Soviet Union.

    During this period, US imperialism occupied our country's Taiwan and launched a large-scale invasion against our neighboring country, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In order to defend national security and safeguard justice and peace, under the call of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people heroically carried out the great struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and achieved a decisive victory.
(II)
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has stipulated that the basic task of our country during the first five-year construction plan period starting in 1953 is: to concentrate efforts on developing heavy industry, establish the foundation for national industrialization, and ensure the steady growth of the proportion of socialist components in the national economy. Under this general goal, agriculture and light industry will be developed accordingly, agricultural and handicraft cooperation will be actively and systematically promoted, and the material and cultural living standards of the people will be improved on the basis of developing production.

    According to the above instructions of the Party, the State Planning Commission is compiling the outline of the first five-year plan. In the first five-year plan, the specific policy of industrial construction in our country is:

    First, to take the development of the national heavy industry as the central link of the five-year construction. This will require huge amounts of funds, a long time, and relatively complex technology, but this policy must not be abandoned in favor of another. Because only by building the country's heavy industry, that is, developing metallurgy, fuel, electricity, machinery, basic chemicals, and other industries, can we establish a solid foundation for our country's industry; can we guarantee the consolidation of national defense and national security; can we establish a strong economic force to ensure our country's economic independence and the rapid growth of socialist economic forces; can we give light industry a broad prospect for development, provide material and technical conditions for the transformation of our country's agriculture, and enable our country's economy to continue to rise and the people's lives to continue to improve.

    In the general development of our country's infrastructure and national economy, we will pay close attention to the comparative relationship between the means of production and the means of consumption, that is, to ensure that the growth rate of the means of production is greater than the growth rate of the means of consumption, and to make the former adapt to the speed of expanded reproduction and the latter adapt to the speed of increasing people's purchasing power.

    Second, in the process of economic development in our country, the proportion of the socialist economy must continue to grow. This is the fundamental path for our country to develop its economy. Because only by continuously increasing the proportion of the socialist economy can we guarantee the daily consolidation and development of the people's democratic system, lay a material foundation for our country's transition to socialism, and finally enable our country to achieve socialist victory. Therefore, we will use our greatest efforts to rapidly develop state-owned industry, state-owned commerce, and cooperative commerce, and continuously strengthen the leading role of socialist economic components in the national economy. Due to China's historical conditions and economic development, at present, the capitalist economy, under the general policy of restriction, will still utilize its part that is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, and adopt methods such as ordering goods, commissioned processing, and joint state-private operation to bring it into the orbit of the national plan, while weakening and gradually eliminating its part that is not conducive to the national economy and people's livelihood.

    Third, further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. Here, the primary issue is to further develop industrial and agricultural production, and on this basis, expand commodity circulation and strengthen economic ties between urban and rural areas. Therefore, great attention will be paid to the development of agriculture, especially increasing grain production. Because only by developing agriculture and increasing grain production can we gradually improve the living standards of farmers; can we accumulate funds for industrial construction from the agricultural sector; can we ensure a sufficient supply of industrial raw materials; can we expand the market for industrial products and promote the development of industry; and can we also expand the source of commercial grain and meet the needs of cities. In order to develop agriculture, under the current conditions, it is necessary to focus on developing the peasant mutual aid and cooperation movement, but also to take care to protect the interests of farmers who have not yet participated in mutual aid and cooperation.

    In order to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, in addition to our industry must supply farmers with the necessary means of production and means of livelihood, our state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives, financial institutions, and credit departments will correctly grasp price policies, tax policies, and credit policies, so that farmers can increase their income on the basis of increasing production, and agriculture can obtain the conditions for continuous expanded reproduction.

    Fourth, on the basis of production development, improve the material and cultural living standards of the working people. Comrade J.V. Stalin taught us that: “Ensuring the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society is the goal of socialist production; constantly increasing and perfecting socialist production on a high technical basis is the means to achieve this goal.” In our country’s five-year construction plan, we will not only stipulate plans for developing production, but also plans for improving the material and cultural life of the people accordingly. Due to the improvement of the material and cultural life of the workers, the masses of the people will more extensively participate in the construction of the country and give full play to their high level of enthusiasm and creativity, and strive for a better future.

    In order to improve the living standards of the working people, the five-year plan stipulates that the growth rate of labor productivity is greater than the growth rate of wages, in order to ensure the accumulation of national funds, promote the further development of industry, and enable the country to have material reserves. Obviously, this is entirely in line with the long-term interests of the working people.
(III)
    In order to realize the five-year construction plan, our country is taking the following series of measures with the selfless and active economic and technical assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries:

    First, vigorously carry out the construction of new industrial enterprises. Within five years, the new enterprises built in our country will include black metallurgical joint factories, non-ferrous metallurgical enterprises, coal mines, coal washing plants, oil processing plants, machinery manufacturing plants, automobile manufacturing plants, power and power machinery manufacturing plants, chemical plants, thermal and hydroelectric power stations, and a number of light industrial factories. These factories and mines will all be equipped with modern equipment. In addition to the above-mentioned large-scale enterprises, under possible conditions, our country will also transform and expand some existing enterprises, and build a certain number of medium and small enterprises. In order to cooperate with the needs of industrial construction and economic development, our country will build thousands of kilometers of railways, and give sufficient attention to road construction and inland waterway transportation.

    When our country started construction, some comrades, due to lack of experience and insufficient understanding of the arduousness of the cause of national economic development, put forward excessively large and urgent plans for the construction of new enterprises. The Party Central Committee has made necessary criticisms of this kind of thinking and practice that does not conform to the objective laws of economic development and the actual situation of our country.

    Second, give full play to the potential of existing enterprises, because our country's existing enterprises will shoulder the arduous task of supplying new enterprises with equipment and training personnel. Our country's existing enterprises are the foundation for the development of our country's industry, so the Party and the government attach great importance to the full utilization of existing enterprise equipment, and take concrete steps and methods to rationally adjust equipment and organize the production of various enterprises; at the same time, gradually implement a scientific management system in existing enterprises, strengthen planning and technical management, strengthen ideological and political work, improve the level of enterprise management, and overcome shortcomings and problems, so that our country's existing enterprises can give full play to their potential and complete and over fulfill the country's production plans.

    When our country started construction, some comrades, due to a lack of understanding of the important role of existing enterprises in national construction, looked down on the original enterprises and did not pay attention to using existing enterprises. The Party Central Committee has also made necessary criticisms of this kind of thinking and practice that does not conform to the Party's policy.

    Third, practice strict economy and accumulate funds. The country's huge-scale construction requires a large amount of funds, and needs to accumulate funds from all aspects.

    Lenin and Stalin taught that: implementing economy and socialist accumulation is the only way to realize industrialization. Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out that: increasing production, reducing costs, overcoming waste, and practicing strict economy are the fundamental methods of accumulating funds. According to these instructions, the Communist Party of China has widely carried out the movement to increase production and practice economy within industrial, commercial, and transportation enterprises. At the same time, we are taking appropriate steps to promote economic accounting methods in all state-owned enterprises, joint state-private enterprises, and cooperative enterprises; in the construction of new industrial and mining enterprises, we are particularly strengthening the leadership of surveying and design and the management of construction.

    Fourth, vigorously cultivate construction cadres. One of the biggest difficulties left to us by the industrially backward old China is the lack of industrial construction cadres and technical forces, which makes it impossible to carry out economic construction on a large scale. Several years of experience in economic recovery have made us realize the seriousness of this problem.

    In order to train cadres for industrial construction, the state has used great efforts to build a number of new universities according to the needs of construction, expanded the scale of existing universities and specialized schools, adjusted the departments of various universities, developed a certain number of secondary technical schools, reformed the curriculum, and strengthened the leadership of these schools; in various larger enterprises, primary technical schools, apprentice schools, or spare-time tutoring schools and short-term training courses were widely held, and effective training methods such as master-apprentice contracts were promoted.

    In the work of training industrial construction cadres, the Party and the government will pay great attention to promoting and training outstanding elements from among the workers, and gradually make them experts in our construction cause and become the backbone of the new industrial intellectuals.

    Finally, in order to strengthen the Party's leadership over economic work and ensure the completion of our country's first five-year construction plan, the Chinese Communists are studying Lenin and Stalin's theories on socialist construction, learning from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, learning from the Soviet Union's methods of leading economic work and advanced labor methods based on science. Seriously learning from the Soviet Union is undoubtedly one of the most important conditions for making our great motherland embark on the correct path of building a new life.

    中华人民共和国怎样发展工业建设
   （原载“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第三十九期）
    李富春
    （一）
    中国人民在取得了革命的胜利以后，就开始了一个新的时期，即逐步过渡到社会主义的新时期。
    中国人民在一步一步地向着社会主义这一伟大目标前进的路上，现在开始了国民经济的有计划建设。中国共产党人和全国人民最主要的任务，就是有计划地发展我国的社会主义工业，促进农业和手工业的合作化，使我国由落后的农业国变为社会主义的工业—农业国。只有国民经济计划化以及正确地指导全国经济的发展，才能实现这些复杂的巨大的任务。
    中华人民共和国在成立以来的短时期内，在各个战线上都取得了伟大的胜利，并为国民经济计划化创设了必要条件。由于完成了全国范围内各项民主的社会改革，肃清了国内的帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的残余势力，提高了工人群众和其他劳动人民的觉悟程度和组织程度，工人阶级领导的人民民主专政已经大大地巩固了。由于经济恢复工作的胜利，我国工农业的生产力特别是近代工业的生产力有了很大提高，工农业的主要产品已经超过了中国历史上的最高年产量的水平；在经济恢复的过程中，大大地增长了社会主义性质的国营经济的比重，确立了国营经济在国民经济中的领导地位；随着经济的恢复和发展，国家的财政收支已经平衡，物价稳定，人民生活得到了初步改善。
    中国人民所取得的伟大胜利，是和伟大盟邦苏联的无私援助分不开的。
    在这时期内，美帝国主义侵占了我国的台湾，并对我国邻邦朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动了大规模的侵略。中国人民为了保卫国家的安全，保卫正义与和平，在毛泽东同志的号召下，英勇地进行了抗美援朝的伟大斗争，并取得了决定的胜利。（二）
    中国共产党中央规定我国从一九五三年开始的第一个五年建设计划期内的基本任务是：集中力量发展重工业，建立国家工业化的基础，保证国民经济中社会主义成份的比重稳步地增长。在这一总目标之下，相应地发展农业和轻工业，积极地有步骤地促进农业和手工业的合作化，并在发展生产的基础上提高人民物质生活和文化生活的水平。
    根据党的上述指示，国家计划委员会正在编制第一个五年计划的大纲。在第一个五年计划中，我国工业建设的具体方针是：
    第一、把发展国家的重工业作为五年建设的中心环节。这将需要巨量资金、较长的时间和比较复杂的技术，但决不能舍弃这一方针而选择另外的方针。因为只有建设国家的重工业，即发展冶金、燃料、电力、机械、基本化学等工业，才能建立我国工业的坚实基础；才能保障国防的巩固和国家的安全；才能建立强大的经济力量，保证我国经济上的完全独立和社会主义经济力量的迅速增长；才能给轻工业以广阔发展的前途，给我国农业的改造提供物质的和技术的条件，使我国经济不断上升，人民的生活不断改善。
    我国在基本建设和国民经济的一般发展中，将十分注意到生产资料与消费资料的对比关系，即保证生产资料的增长速度大于消费资料的增长速度，并使前者与扩大再生产的速度相适应，后者与人民购买力提高的速度相适应。
    第二、在我国发展经济的过程中，要使社会主义经济的比重不断得到增长。这是我国发展经济的根本道路。因为只有不断增长社会主义经济的比重，才能保证人民民主制度的日益巩固和发展，才能为我国过渡到社会主义奠定物质的基础，最后使我国取得社会主义的胜利。因此，我们将以最大的力量来迅速发展国营工业、国营商业和合作社商业，并不断加强社会主义经济成份在国民经济中的领导作用。由于中国的历史条件和经济发展的情况，目前对于资本主义经济，在总的限制政策下，仍将利用其有利于国计民生的部分，并采取定货、委托加工、公私合营等方法将其纳入国家计划的轨道，同时削弱和逐渐淘汰其不利于国计民生的部分。
    第三、进一步巩固工农联盟。在这里，首要的问题是进一步发展工农业的生产，并在此基础上扩大商品流转，加强城乡经济联系。因此，对于发展农业特别是增产粮食，将给予很大的注意。因为只有发展农业和增产粮食，才能逐步地提高农民的生活水平；才能从农业方面积累工业建设的资金；才能保证工业原料的充分供应；才能扩大工业品的市场，促进工业的发展；也才能扩大商品粮食的来源，满足城市的需要。为了发展农业，在目前条件下，需要着重发展农民互助合作运动，但同时也照顾到保护还没有参加互助合作的农民的利益。
    为了进一步巩固工农联盟，除我们的工业必须供应农民所必需的生产资料和生活资料外，我们的国营商业和供销合作社、财政机关和信贷部门，将正确地掌握价格政策、税收政策和信贷政策，以便使农民在增加生产的基础上增加收入，使农业获得不断扩大再生产的条件。
    第四、在生产发展的基础上，提高劳动人民物质生活和文化生活的水平。约·维·斯大林教导我们说：“保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要，就是社会主义生产的目的；在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善，就是达到这一目的的手段。”在我国的五年建设计划内，不仅将规定发展生产的计划，而且将规定与之相适应的改善人民物质生活与文化生活的计划。由于劳动者物质生活和文化生活的改善，人民群众将更广泛地参加国家的建设事业，并发挥高度的积极性和创造性，为更加美好的未来而奋斗。
    为了提高劳动人民的生活水平，五年计划规定劳动生产率增长的速度大于工资增长的速度，以保证国家资金的积累，促进工业的进一步发展，使国家的物资有积存。很明显，这是完全符合于劳动人民长远的利益的。（三）
    为了实现五年建设计划，我们的国家在苏联及各兄弟国家无私的积极的经济和技术援助之下正在采取下述的一系列的措施：
    第一、大力进行新的工业企业的建设。五年以内我国新建的企业，将包括黑色冶金联合工厂、有色冶金企业、煤炭矿井、选煤工厂、石油加工工厂、机械制造工厂、汽车制造工厂、动力和电力机械制造工厂、化学工厂、火力和水力发电站，以及若干轻工业工厂。这些工厂和矿山，都将采用近代化的装备。除了上述规模巨大的企业外，在可能的条件下，我国还将改造与扩建一些现有的企业，并建设一定数量的中、小型企业。为了配合工业建设和经济发展的需要，我国将修建数千公里的铁路，并对公路建设和内河航运方面给予足够的重视。
    在我国开始进行建设的时候，曾有一些同志，由于缺乏经验和不具体了解国民经济发展事业的艰巨性，把新的企业的建设计划提得过大，要求过急。对于这种不符合客观经济发展规律和我国实际情况的想法和做法，党中央曾进行了必要的批判。
    第二、充分发挥现有企业的潜在力量，因为我国现有的企业将担负供应新企业以设备及训练人材等方面的艰巨任务。我国现有的企业是发展我国工业的基础，因此党和政府十分重视现有企业设备的充分利用，并采取具体的步骤和方法，合理地调整设备和组织各个企业的生产；同时，在现有企业中逐步地实行科学的管理制度，加强计划与技术管理，加强思想工作和政治工作，提高企业管理的水平，克服缺点和毛病，以便使我国的现有企业能充分发挥潜在力量，完成和超额完成国家的生产计划。
    在我国开始进行建设的时候，曾有一些同志，由于不了解现有企业在国家建设中的重要作用，因此看不起原有的企业，不注意利用现有企业。对于这种不符合党的方针的想法和做法，党中央也曾进行了必要的批判。
    第三、厉行节约，积累资金。国家巨大规模的建设，需要有大量的资金，需要从各方面积聚资金。
    列宁、斯大林曾教导说：实行节约和社会主义积累，是实现工业化的唯一的道路。毛泽东同志也指出：增加生产、降低成本、克服浪费现象、厉行节约，是积累资金的根本方法。按照这些指示，中国共产党在工业和商业以及交通运输的企业内部，广泛地开展了增产节约的运动。同时，我们正采取妥善的步骤，在一切国营企业中，在公私合营企业和合作社企业中，推行经济核算的方法；在新的工矿企业的建设中，我们特别加强对勘察设计的领导和施工的管理。
    第四、大力培养建设干部。工业落后的旧中国遗留给我们的最大困难之一，是工业建设干部和技术力量的缺乏，这种情况使经济建设不能大规模地展开。数年来经济恢复的经验使我们认识到这一问题的严重性。
    为了培养工业建设的干部，国家已用很大的力量，根据建设的需要，新建了若干高等学校，扩大了原有大学、专科学校的规模，调整了各高等学校的院系，发展了一定数量的中级技术学校，改革了课程，并加强了对这些学校的领导；在各个较大的企业中，普遍举办了初级技术学校、艺徒学校或业余补习学校和短期训练班，推行了师徒合同等有效的训练方法。
    在培养工业建设干部工作中，党和政府将十分注意提拔和培养工人中的优秀分子，并逐步地使他们成为我们建设事业中的专家，成为新的工业知识分子的骨干。
    最后，为了加强党对经济工作的领导，保证我国第一个五年建设计划的完成，中国共产党人正在学习列宁、斯大林关于社会主义建设的理论，学习苏联共产党，学习苏联的领导经济工作的方法和建立在科学基础上的先进的劳动方法。认真地学习苏联，无疑地是使我们的伟大祖国走上建设新生活的正确道路的最重要条件之一。
