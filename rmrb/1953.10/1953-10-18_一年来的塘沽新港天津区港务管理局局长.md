The people's Tanggu New Port has been participating in the economic construction of the motherland for a year now.

The facts of the past year have shown that Tanggu New Port has immeasurable value and significance in the economic life of our people, especially the people of North China. It has raised the status of the Tianjin port area; it has reversed the flow of some materials, reduced the cost of imported materials in North China, and also reduced the turnover costs of exported materials in North China. The facts of the past year prove that the hardworking and courageous Chinese people have the ability to build the seaports they need and the ability to manage their ports well.

Since the opening of the port on October 17 last year, especially after the Tianjin District Bureau announced the depth of the Tanggu New Port channel to domestic and foreign countries in July this year, the number of domestic and foreign ships coming to Tanggu New Port has been increasing day by day, and the import and export of materials has also been increasing day by day. It is worth noting that the speed of this increase far exceeds our expectations. In the first nine months of this year alone, the materials imported and exported from Tianjin Port exceeded any year since liberation. The throughput in September even set the highest monthly throughput record in the past ten years. This has greatly changed and improved the position of Tianjin Port in my country's seaports. In the past, the materials exported from Tianjin Port generally accounted for less than 30 percent of my country's seaport export materials, and the materials imported from Tianjin Port accounted for only 20 percent of my country's seaport import materials. However, from January to September this year, the materials exported from Tianjin Port increased to 60 percent of the country's export materials, and the materials imported from Tianjin Port accounted for 40 percent of the country's import materials. That is to say, Tianjin Port has become the center of my country's foreign trade, and about half of the country's import and export materials are exchanged in Tianjin. This situation has directly promoted the prosperity of the Tianjin market.

Before the completion of Tanggu New Port, Tianjin Port did not have deep-water docks, and ships with a deadweight of 10,000 tons could not dock. At that time, many materials that should have been loaded and unloaded in Tianjin had to be detoured through Dalian and Guangzhou, and then transported to Tianjin and other parts of North China by train. Therefore, the price of imported materials was expensive, and the people of North China suffered a lot of losses. We calculated that if the goods loaded and unloaded at Tanggu New Port since this year were transported from foreign countries to Guangzhou as usual, and then transferred to Tianjin by railway, it would require many train carriages and an additional 50 billion yuan in transportation costs. If the goods loaded and unloaded at Tanggu New Port this year were transported from foreign countries to Dalian as usual, and then transported to Tianjin by train, it would require an additional 12 billion yuan in transportation costs. That is to say, the completion and opening of Tanggu New Port has reduced the transportation burden on the railway and saved a lot of wealth for the country and the people.

Before the opening of Tanggu New Port, ships with a deadweight of 10,000 tons often anchored on the sea surface outside Dagukou, and then were transported by tugboats and barges. It is natural that mechanical loading and unloading tools cannot be used for loading and unloading goods at sea. Therefore, the loading and unloading speed is extremely slow, the cost is high, and it is easily attacked by wind and waves, which is very dangerous. After the opening of Tanggu New Port, 10,000-ton freighters can directly sail to the new port to dock. We also calculated that if the goods loaded and unloaded at the new port this year were anchored outside Dagukou for loading and unloading as usual, and then transported to Tianjin by tugboats and barges, our country and people would have to pay an additional 22 billion yuan in expenses.

As a port management personnel, standing in front of the "gateway to the motherland," port workers have a profound experience of international friendship between brotherly countries. In the past, Tianjin Port, like other ports in our country, was a springboard for imperialist aggression against our country's territory and a base for plundering our country's resources. At that time, Tianjin imported consumables and luxury goods, and exported our precious industrial raw materials. All the ships coming and going were imperialist ships. They robbed a large number of materials from our door and turned around to attack us from here. Today's Tanggu New Port has swept away the past situation of "customs cannot be independent." The key to entering and exiting this gate is completely in our own hands. The main countries that interact with us are our brotherly countries—the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Under the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and with a high degree of internationalist spirit, they have sent us a large number of machines, hardware equipment, scientific instruments, and chemical fertilizers for developing agricultural production, as well as paper and stationery for developing cultural education. At the same time, they have also taken away the means of production and means of livelihood necessary for the development of their own national production. This trade policy of common development for both sides is in contrast to the trade of imperialism in the past. We cannot but express our deep gratitude to the brotherly countries headed by the Soviet Union for their sincere assistance to our country.

In this year, the management of Tanggu New Port has also been greatly improved, and the vast number of employees and administrative staff have also been improved and tempered. We have understood how to manage our "gateway" well.

When Tanggu New Port was first built, we were in a state of "having a horse but no saddle," that is, when the new port was opened, the equipment on the port was still very simple, and many things that should have been built were not built in time. But in this year, our channel has become deeper, the land equipment has increased, the warehouses have almost doubled compared to the beginning of the port, and the 40,000 square meters of open cargo yard were all newly built this year. Various mechanized loading and unloading tools have been added to the dock, which has basically changed the past phenomenon of relying solely on manual labor, and the physical labor of loading and unloading workers has been reduced to a minimum. In line with the addition of mechanical loading and unloading equipment, the labor efficiency of workers has been greatly improved. In the early days of the port opening, only 725 tons of goods could be loaded and unloaded per day and night, but this year it has increased to 1,388 tons per day. In September, when there were an unprecedented number of ships, the workers increased the daily loading and unloading volume to 1,794 tons. This high-speed loading and unloading efficiency has been praised by international friends. Comrade Moloszkiewicz, the captain of the "Bialystok" ship of the brotherly country Poland, even wrote a letter to the workers of the new port because of this. The letter said: Such a high-speed efficiency of the loading and unloading workers in the new port is "something I have never seen in my 25 years of sailing." The workers of the new port were encouraged, and their enthusiasm for labor was even higher. They unanimously announced that they would increase the loading and unloading efficiency even higher.

While the loading and unloading workers launched the "fast loading and unloading" campaign, the pilots put forward the slogan of letting ships "enter and exit quickly." They calculated that for a 10,000-ton freighter coming and going to the new port, every extra day it stays in the port, the ship consumes more than 60 million yuan, and our country must also pay a certain amount of ship demurrage fees to others. Conversely, one day earlier that the ship leaves the port, it will not only reduce the ship's consumption of more than 60 million yuan, but also our country can earn an extra sum of "dispatch money." And one day earlier or one day later, the pilot is often one of the deciding factors. Therefore, the pilots proposed to strive to collect more "dispatch money" and never let the country pay more demurrage fees because of piloting. Under such goals, they disregarded the limitations of the harsh natural environment, forgot their fatigue, and set seven new night航 records. This is very difficult in Tianjin Port, where channel conditions are relatively difficult.

The biggest progress in administrative management in this year is the implementation of the loading and unloading cargo operation plan. Before each ship docks, they hold a "pre-ship meeting" to specifically allocate labor, specifically arrange the location of cargo storage, and formulate loading and unloading indicators... making the complicated and busy dock loading and unloading work as orderly as parallel assembly line operations in a factory. This prepares the conditions for "fast loading and unloading" and also inspires the workers' enthusiasm for labor. The workers said: "As long as we set a goal, we can exceed it." The fact is also true. The workers' labor efficiency always breaks through our operation plan. This provides conditions for the formulation of quota management.

Standing in front of the great "gateway to the capital," the workers of the port deeply understand the importance of their responsibilities. On this first anniversary of the opening of Tanggu New Port, we are determined to learn from brotherly ports, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and under the leadership and supervision of the Party and the Central People's Government, build the people's Tanggu New Port better and manage it better!

    一年来的塘沽新港天津区港务管理局局长
    吴英民
    人民的塘沽新港，参加到祖国经济建设行列里已经一年了。
    一年来的事实说明：塘沽新港在我国人民、特别是华北人民的经济生活上，有着不可估量的价值和意义。它提高了天津港区的地位；它扭转了一部分物资的流转方向，减低了华北进口物资的成本，也减少了华北出口物资的周转费用。一年来的事实证明：勤劳而勇敢的中国人民，有能力修成自己所需要的海港，也有本领把自己的港口经营得好。
    自从去年十月十七日开港以来，特别是今年七月，天津区局向国内外公布了塘沽新港的航道水深以后，前来塘沽新港靠岸的国内外船只一天天增多，进口与出口的物资也一天天上升。值得注意的是：这种增多与上升的速度，远远超过了我们的预计。单是今年头九个月，从天津港进口与出口的物资，就超过了解放后的任何一年。九月份的吞吐数量，更创近十年来所没有的月度吞吐量的最高纪录。这就大大改变和提高了天津港在我国海港中的地位。过去，从天津港输出的物资，一般不到我国海港出口物资的百分之三十，从天津港进口的物资，也只占我国海港进口物资的百分之二十。可是今年一月到九月，从天津港出口的物资，提高到全国出口物资的百分之六十，从天津港进口的物资，占全国进口物资的百分之四十。这就是说，天津港已成为目前我国对外贸易的中心，全国半数左右的进出口物资，要在天津交换。这种情况，直接促进了天津市场的繁荣。
    塘沽新港没有修成以前，天津港没有深水码头，载重万吨的轮船不能靠岸，那时，许多应在天津装卸的物资，不得不绕道大连、广州，然后再由火车运来天津及华北各地。因此进口物资的价格昂贵，华北人民承受了不少损失。我们计算了一下，如果把今年以来，在塘沽新港装卸的货物，像往常那样由外洋到广州，然后再由铁路转运来天津，那就需要许多辆火车皮，同时必须再多付出五百亿元的运费。如果把今年在塘沽新港装卸的货物，像往常那样由外洋到大连，然后再用火车运来天津，那就必须再多付出一百二十亿元的运费。这就是说：塘沽新港的修成和开港，减轻了铁路上的运输负担，为国家和人民节省了大量财富。
    塘沽新港没有开港以前，载重万吨的轮船，往往停泊在大沽口以外的海面上，然后再用拖轮、驳船起运。在海上装卸货物，自然不能使用机械装卸工具，因此，装卸速度极慢，费用也高，又容易受风浪的袭击，危险很大。塘沽新港开港后，万吨巨轮就可以直驶新港靠岸。我们也计算了一下，如果把今年在新港装卸的货物，像往常那样停泊在大沽口外去装卸，然后再用拖轮、驳船运天津，那我们的国家和人民，就必须再多付出二百二十亿元的开支。
    作为一个港务管理人员，站在“祖国门户”之前的海港工作者，对于各兄弟国家间的国际友谊的体验是深刻的。过去，天津港也和我国其它港口一样，是帝国主义侵略我国领土的跳板，掠夺我国资源的据点。那时，从天津进口的是消耗品和奢侈品，出口的是我们宝贵的工业原料，来来往往的全是帝国主义的船只，它们从我们的门前抢走大批物资，反过来又从这里来打我们。现在的塘沽新港，一扫过去那种“海关不能自主”的局面，进出这个大门的钥匙，完全掌握在我们自己手里。和我们进行来往的，主要是我们的兄弟国家——苏联和各人民民主国家。他们在平等互惠的原则下，以高度的国际主义精神，给我们送来了大量的机器、五金器材、科学仪器和发展农业生产的化学肥料，以及发展文化教育的纸张、文具等。同时，他们也带走了发展他们本国生产所必需的生产资料和生活资料，这种双方共同发展的贸易方针，和以往帝国主义的贸易相对照，我们不能不对以苏联为首的对我国真挚援助的兄弟国家表示深切的感激。
    在这一年当中，塘沽新港的管理上，也得到很大改善，广大职工和行政管理人员，也得到了提高和锻炼，我们已经懂得了怎样把我们的“门户”管好。
    当塘沽新港建成之初，我们是处在“有马无鞍”的状态下，就是说，当新港开港以后，港上的设备还很简陋，许多应该建设的东西，一时来不及建设。但在这一年中，我们的航道更深了，陆上设备增加了，仓库比开港当初增多了几近一倍，四万平方公尺的露天货场，全是今年新建的。码头上添了各种各样的机械化的装卸工具，基本上改变了过去那种单靠人工的现象，装卸工人的体力劳动减少到了最低限度。和增添机械装卸设备相适应，工人的劳动效率大大提高，开港初期，每昼夜只能装卸货物七百二十五吨，今年提高到每天一千三百八十八吨。在来船空前繁多的九月份，工人们更把每天的装卸数量，提高到一千七百九十四吨。这种高速度的装卸效率，曾得到国际友人的赞许。兄弟国家波兰的“比奥斯托克”号船船长摩洛淑维茨基同志，还因此给新港工人写了一封信。信中说：像新港装卸工人这么高速度的效率，“是我二十五年的航海生活中从来没有见过的”。新港工人得到了鼓励，他们的劳动热情更高了，一致宣布要把装卸效率提得更高。
    在装卸工人开展“快装快卸”运动的同时，引水员提出让船只“快进快出”的口号。他们计算了一下，像来往在新港的万吨轮船，在港上多停一天，船上就多消耗六千多万元，另外我们的国家还必须付给人家一定数量的船只延期费。相反的，船只早出港一天，这就不仅减少了船上六千多万元的消耗，而且我们的国家就能额外收入一大笔“速遣费”。而早一天或迟一天，引水员往往是决定因素之一。因此，引水员提出争取多收“速遣费”，决不因引水而让国家多出延期费。在这样的目标下，他们不顾恶劣的自然环境的限制，忘记了自己的疲劳，连创七次夜航新纪录。这在航道条件比较困难的天津港，是很不容易的。
    这一年中，行政管理工作中的最大进步，是推行了装卸货物的作业计划。每逢船只靠岸以前，他们召开“船前会议”，具体分配劳动力，具体安排货物停放地，制订装卸指标……使复杂而忙乱的码头装卸工作，像工厂的平行流水作业一样井井有条。这给“快装快卸”准备了条件，也启发了工人的劳动热情。工人们说：“只要订出目标，我们就能够超过。”事实也正是这样，工人们的劳动效率，总是突破我们的作业计划。这就给制订定额管理提供了条件。
    站在伟大的“首都门户”之前的港湾工作者，深深懂得自己责任的重大，在这塘沽新港开港一周年纪念日，我们决心向兄弟港口学习，向苏联的先进经验学习，在党和中央人民政府领导、督促之下，把人民的塘沽新港建设得更好，经营管理得更好！
