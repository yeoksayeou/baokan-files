Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: The German Democratic Republic celebrated its fourth anniversary on October 7th. Over the past four years, the German Democratic Republic has made many achievements in political, economic, and cultural construction based on profound democratic reforms. Now, in the German Democratic Republic, the monopoly capitalism and Junker land ownership that formed the basis of aggressive German imperialism no longer exist. All large industrial enterprises in the German Democratic Republic have become the property of the people, and the land belongs to the working farmers who cultivate it.

Currently, the average monthly industrial production level in the German Democratic Republic is 64.4 percent higher than the pre-war level of 1936. As a result of the completion of the national economic plan in the second quarter of 1953, the overall level of industrial production increased by 10.4 percent compared to the second quarter of 1952. The achievements of the German Democratic Republic's industrial development can be exemplified by the metallurgical industry: the German Democratic Republic now produces four times as much pig iron as in 1950, and by 1954 it will be six times as much as in 1950; the steel produced by a new metallurgical plant in Brandenburg in 1954 will be equal to the total steel production of all metallurgical plants in the German Democratic Republic in 1950.

This summer, the government of the German Democratic Republic, on the advice of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, began implementing a new policy aimed at raising the material living standards of all strata of residents in the German Democratic Republic. Due to the implementation of various measures under the new policy, residents' purchasing power will increase by 2 billion marks this year alone. In the second half of this year, residents will receive 5 billion marks more in goods than in the first half of the year. The German Democratic Republic has repeatedly lowered prices in state-owned stores and abolished rationing for many means of production and daily necessities. Prices will be reduced again in 1954, and residents will benefit by 4.5 billion marks. The remaining rationing system will be abolished in 1954. The new policy of the German Democratic Republic government has been warmly embraced by residents of all strata in the republic, triggering a new upsurge in the labor competition to complete the national economic plan ahead of schedule in enterprises across the country.

The German Democratic Republic has achieved great success in agriculture. The current per-unit-area yield of agricultural crops and the number of livestock have exceeded the pre-war level of 1936. The government provides laboring farmers with substantial practical assistance, such as loans, and the supply of fertilizers and seeds. In the course of implementing the new policy, the government has reduced the total amount of grain collected and purchased, allowing farmers to directly benefit by as much as 1 billion marks in 1953. The German Democratic Republic has established an extensive network of machine tractor stations with modern agricultural machinery. In 1953 alone, machine tractor stations received 5,900 tractors, 2,400 binders, 2,700 cultivators, 5,300 tractor-drawn plows, and a large number of other agricultural machines. In 1954, the German Democratic Republic will begin producing grain combine harvesters, beet combine harvesters, and potato combine harvesters. In addition to helping individual farmers, the government is also trying to promote the development of agricultural production cooperatives. The German Democratic Republic now has 4,800 agricultural production cooperatives, accounting for 13 percent of the country's cultivated land.

The government of the Republic is very concerned about improving the material and cultural life of the working people. In the course of implementing the new policy, the government allocated an additional 600 million marks to expand residential construction. During the Weimar Republic, the children of workers and peasants accounted for only 2 to 3 percent of the students in universities, while now the children of workers and peasants account for 45.2 percent of all university students in the German Democratic Republic. Ninety-four percent of university students in the German Democratic Republic now receive state scholarships.

    德意志民主共和国建设成就巨大
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社柏林讯：十月七日是德意志民主共和国成立四周年纪念日。四年来，德意志民主共和国在深刻的民主改革的基础上所进行的政治、经济和文化建设取得了许多成就。现在，在德意志民主共和国内，作为侵略性的德国帝国主义基础的垄断资本主义和容克土地所有制已不存在。德意志民主共和国所有的大工业企业都已成为人民的财产，土地归耕种土地的劳动农民所有。
    目前，德意志民主共和国每月的工业生产平均水平，比战前一九三六年提高了百分之六十四点四。一九五三年第二季度国民经济计划完成的结果，工业生产总水平比一九五二年第二季度提高了百分之十点四。德意志民主共和国工业发展的成就可以冶金工业为例：德意志民主共和国现在出产的铣铁为一九五○年的四倍，到一九五四年将为一九五○年的六倍；在布兰登堡新建的一个冶金工厂一九五四年为国家生产的钢，将等于一九五○年德意志民主共和国所有冶金工厂钢生产量的总和。
    今年夏天，德意志民主共和国政府根据德国统一社会党的建议，开始执行新方针，目的是提高德意志民主共和国各阶层居民的物质生活水平。由于执行新方针的各种措施，居民的购买力今年一年就将提高二十亿马克。今年下半年，居民将得到比上半年多五十亿马克的物品。德意志民主共和国已经不止一次地降低了国营商店的物价，并废除了许多生产品和日用品的配给制。一九五四年将再度降低物价，居民们将可以获益四十五亿马克。一九五四年将取消其余的配给制。德意志民主共和国政府的新方针受到共和国各阶层居民的热烈拥护，引起了全国各企业争取提前完成国民经济计划的劳动竞赛的新高潮。
    德意志民主共和国的农业取得了巨大的成就。现在的农业作物单位面积产量和牲畜头数已经超过了战前一九三六年的水平。政府给予劳动农民巨大的实际援助，如贷款、供应肥料和种子等。在执行新方针的过程中，政府降低了征收和征购的粮食总额，使农民在一九五三年内直接得益达十亿马克之多。德意志民主共和国建立了广泛的、拥有现代化农业机器的机器拖拉机站网。仅仅在一九五三年内，机器拖拉机站就得到了五千九百台拖拉机，二千四百台捆禾机，二千七百台中耕机，五千三百架拖拉机牵引犁以及大量其他农业机器。一九五四年，德意志民主共和国将开始生产谷物联合收割机、甜菜联合收割机和马铃薯联合收割机。政府除了帮助个体农民外，还设法促进农业生产合作社的发展。德意志民主共和国现在共有四千八百个农业生产合作社，占有全国耕地的百分之十三。
    共和国政府非常关心改善劳动人民的物质和文化生活。在执行新方针过程中，政府额外拨出了六亿马克来扩大住宅建筑。在魏玛共和国时，在高等学校学生中，工农子弟只占百分之二到三，而现在德意志民主共和国的所有高等学校的学生中，工农子弟占百分之四十五点二。德意志民主共和国百分之九十四的高等学校学生现在得到国家的助学金。
