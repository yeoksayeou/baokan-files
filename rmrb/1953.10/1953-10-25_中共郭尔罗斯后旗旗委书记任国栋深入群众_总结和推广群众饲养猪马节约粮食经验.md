CPC Guorlos Houqi Committee Secretary Ren Guodong went deep into Tongxin Village in the Fifth District and, together with experienced elderly farmers, studied methods for increasing production and practicing economy. He put forward the experience of raising pigs and horses well while saving grain, and identified this as an important link in increasing production and saving grain.

In Tongxin Village, the entire village has a total of 160 pigs. According to past habits, each pig had to be fed one to two shi of grain from autumn to the end of the year. When Committee Secretary Ren Guodong convened a meeting in this village with elderly farmers, women, and others to study ways to increase production and practice economy, two old women from the Feng and Shao families introduced their experience of using goosefoot seeds, alkali bluegrass seeds, grain chaff, soybean leaves, and sorghum husks to feed pigs well instead of grain. They had been feeding two fat pigs well every year using this method, and the pork fat was three fingers thick. After they introduced these experiences, neighbors confirmed that this was what they did. Their specific feeding method is: boil the goosefoot seeds mixed with some broken grain, then take them out to prevent them from turning black in the pot, which pigs dislike. When feeding, the food should be warm; if it is too hot, the pigs will not gain weight and will grow red hair, affecting the quality of the pig bristles. Feeding the pigs should be done at a fixed time and in a fixed quantity, with frequent small additions. The pig trough should be raised to avoid choking and overturning, and to facilitate the pigs' overall weight gain. Every ten days or half a month, add some salt, small hemp seeds, and garlic peels to the feed to stimulate the pigs' appetite, clear their intestines, and prevent them from getting sick. When feeding the horses at night, the pigs are also driven up, not allowing them to urinate in their pens, and the pig pens are cleaned and padded frequently. Committee Secretary Ren Guodong studied with the masses and believed that using this method to feed pigs could save five dou of grain per pig by the end of the year, while still allowing them to gain weight. If all 160 pigs in the village were fed using this method, 80 shi of grain could be saved. For the entire banner’s 20,000 pigs, 10,000 shi of grain could be saved by the end of the year. This is a major project in increasing production and practicing economy, so it was decided to promote it throughout the banner.

Committee Secretary Ren Guodong also studied with the farmers the existing methods among the farmers of using grain chaff, shriveled sorghum, sorghum husks, and soybeans that did not mature properly to replace horse feed. These methods were summarized and proposed, and the farmers agreed with them. Farmers in Tongxin Village estimated that this year, because the village's crops were affected by disasters, the collected broken grain would be enough for the horses to eat, and they could still be fattened. According to past habits, each horse needed two to two and a half shi of grain. This time, using broken grain to replace part of the good grain, each horse can save one shi of grain. If this is implemented throughout the banner, 35,000 draft horses can save 35,000 shi of good grain.

After these methods were promoted, many women went to visit old Mrs. Feng's house. One old woman went to see it twice. After the farmers in Tongxin Village accepted this method, more than 40 women went to the fields, roadsides, wasteland grids, and alkali flats to gather alkali bluegrass seeds, goosefoot seeds, and barnyard grass, with the most gathering seven dou to one shi. Twenty-eight young women and five old women from the Wanghu Ma Agricultural Production Cooperative gathered more than four shi and nine dou in five days. They each planned to gather one shi and five dou, enough to feed 32 fat pigs.

    中共郭尔罗斯后旗旗委书记任国栋深入群众
    总结和推广群众饲养猪马节约粮食经验
    中共黑龙江省郭尔罗斯后旗旗委书记任国栋，深入五区同新村和有经验的老年农民研究增产节约办法，提出了饲养好猪和马，又节约了粮食的经验，并认定这是增产节约粮食的重要环节。
    同新村全村共一百六十口猪，按过去旧习惯，每口猪从秋天到年底要喂一石到两石粮食。旗委书记任国栋在这个村召集老农、妇女等座谈，研究增产节约办法时，冯、邵两家的老太太介绍了她们用灰菜籽、堿蓬籽、谷秕子、黄豆叶、高粱壳等代替粮食喂好猪的经验。她们两家每年都这样喂好两口肥猪，肉膘有三指厚。她们介绍这些经验后，邻居都证实她们两家是这样做的。她们具体饲养的办法是：把灰菜籽掺些秕粮食煮熟后，就捞出来，免得在锅里煮黑了猪不爱吃，捞出后并要挑净草秆。喂的时候要温热，太热了猪吃了不上膘，还长红毛，影响猪鬃质量。喂猪要有一定时间和数量，少添勤添。要把猪槽垫高，避免呛食和翻槽，也便于猪全身增加重量。每隔十天半月，喂时稍加一些盐、小麻籽、蒜皮，猪开胃串肠，不闹病。晚上喂马的时候，同时就把猪赶起来，不让尿窝，勤起勤垫猪圈。旗委书记任国栋和群众研究，认为用这个办法喂猪，到年底每口猪可节省五斗粮食，还照样能长膘，如果全村一百六十口猪都用这办法，就可节约八十石粮食，全旗两万口猪，到年底可节省出一万石粮食。这是增产节约中的一个大项目，所以决定向全旗推广。
    旗委书记任国栋又和农民研究了农民中已有的用谷秕子、瞎高粱、高粱壳、没上成实的豆子代替马料。这些办法经过总结提出后，农民都很赞成。同新村农民估计，今年因该村庄稼受灾，所收秕粮食就足够马吃，而且一样能把马喂肥。按过去习惯，每匹马需要两石到两石五斗粮食，这回用秕粮食代替一部分好粮食，每匹马可节省一石粮食。如果在全旗推行，三万五千匹耕马就可节省三万五千石好粮食。
    这些办法经推广后，有许多妇女到老冯家参观，有一位老太太连去看了两次。同新村农民接受这一办法后，有四十多名妇女到地里、道旁、荒地格子、堿甸子上去撸堿蓬籽、灰菜籽和风稗，最多的撸到七斗到一石。王湖马农业生产合作社二十八名青年妇女和五名老太太，五天撸了四石九斗多，她们每人计划撸一石五斗，共喂三十二口肥猪。
