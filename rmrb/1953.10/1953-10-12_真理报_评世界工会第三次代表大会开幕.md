Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th - The "Pravda" published an editorial on the 10th, titled "A Congress of Solidarity for Working People". The editorial said that the Third World Federation of Trade Unions Congress opened in Vienna on the 10th. Millions of working people in countries around the world are watching this congress. The congress will discuss issues of vital importance to the struggle of working people for their rights, for improved living conditions, and for peace and international security.

The editorial pointed out that this congress is of particular significance because, unlike previous international trade union congresses, this congress is a congress of unity. Representatives of all trade union organizations in the world can participate in this congress on a broad democratic basis. Currently, trade union organizations from ninety-six countries have sent telegrams to congratulate the congress and issued statements of support, including seventy-four national trade union centers (sixteen of which have not yet joined the World Federation of Trade Unions) and two hundred and forty-five trade union organizations (ninety-one of which have not yet joined the World Federation of Trade Unions).

Another feature of this World Trade Union Congress is that the delegates were not only selected from the leading bodies of the organizations participating in the congress but were also directly elected from among the broad masses of workers in factories and institutions.

All this illustrates the broad representation of this congress, its mass character, and the great interest of workers from all countries around the world in the convening of the congress.

The editorial pointed out that since its establishment, the World Federation of Trade Unions has been fighting for the great unity of the international trade union movement and for strengthening the international solidarity of working people. The successful experiences of workers in Italy and France, as well as workers in other capitalist countries, demonstrate that the most powerful and effective weapon for working people in the struggle for their own rights and for peace and international security is united action, is the courageous struggle undertaken by all working people of various views and political parties. Where workers have united action, there workers will triumph.

The reactionary leaders of the American trade union center, who serve the interests of American monopoly capital, are obstructing the unity of trade unions, a behavior that can only arouse the unanimous condemnation of working people. The strong support of the broad masses of people for the World Trade Union Congress powerfully demonstrates this point.

The editorial emphasized that workers are increasingly aware that the struggle to improve living standards is inseparable from the struggle for peace. The World Trade Union Congress is opening at a time when people in all countries are demanding a solution to international disputes and a halt to the arms race that promotes the decline of peaceful industries, promotes unemployment, increases taxes, and impoverishes the working people. Working people everywhere hope that this congress will be an important stage in strengthening the unity of working people in the struggle for their own interests and for peace and international security.

The editorial concluded by saying that the decisions adopted by the congress will undoubtedly push the struggle of workers for their own interests, for peace and democracy, and for the happiness of mankind to a higher level.

    “真理报”评世界工会第三次代表大会开幕
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”十日发表社论，题为“劳动人民团结的大会”。社论说，世界工会第三次代表大会十日在维也纳开幕了。世界各国千百万劳动人民都注视着这个大会。大会将讨论对于劳动人民争取他们的权利、争取改善生活条件、争取和平与国际安全的斗争至关紧要的问题。
    社论指出，这次大会之所以具有特别重大的意义，还在于它与过去所举行的历次国际工会代表大会不同，这次大会是一个团结的大会。世界上所有工会组织的代表都能在广泛的民主基础上参加这次大会。现在已有九十六个国家的工会组织致电大会祝贺并发表支持大会的声明，其中有七十四个全国性的工会中心（其中有十六个还没有参加世界工联），二百四十五个工会组织（其中有九十一个还没有参加世界工联）。
    这次世界工会代表大会还有一个特色是：这次大会的代表不仅是从参加大会的组织的领导机构中选出来的，也有在工厂与机关的广大工人中直接选出来的。
    这都说明了这次大会的广泛代表性，说明了它的群众性，并说明了世界各国工人对大会的召开有着极大的兴趣。
    社论指出，世界工联自从成立以来，一直在为国际工会运动大团结、为加强劳动人民的国际团结而斗争。意大利和法国工人以及其他资本主义国家工人取得胜利的经验说明，在争取自身权利、争取和平与国际安全的斗争中，劳动人民最有力、最有效的武器是统一行动，是各种见解和各种政治党派的所有劳动人民联合起来从事勇敢的斗争。那里工人有了统一行动，那里的工人就会胜利。
    为美国垄断资本服务的美国工会中心的反动领袖们，正在阻挠工会的团结，这种行为只能引起劳动人民的一致谴责。广大人民对世界工会代表大会的支持就有力地表明了这一点。
    社论强调指出，工人们越来越认识到，争取提高生活水平的斗争与争取和平的斗争是分不开的。世界工会代表大会开幕的时候，正是在各国人民要求解决国际争端，要求停止那促成和平工业萎缩、促成失业、税额增加及劳动人民日益贫穷的扩军运动的时候。世界各地劳动人民都希望这次大会将成为加强劳动人民在争取切身利益、争取和平与国际安全的斗争中的团结的一个重要阶段。
    社论最后说，大会将通过的决定无疑会把工人争取切身利益、争取和平与民主、争取人类的幸福的斗争推向更高的水平。
