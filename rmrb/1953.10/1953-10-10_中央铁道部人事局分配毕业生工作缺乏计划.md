    Central Ministry of Railways Personnel Bureau
    Lacks Planning in Allocating Jobs to Graduates
    Reader Luo Chaochen writes: I am a graduate of the Russian Department of Harbin Railway Institute this year. On August 13th, I and several other classmates were assigned by the Personnel Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways to work at the Jinan Railway Administration. Unexpectedly, the Personnel Department of the Jinan Railway Administration was unaware of this. After a temporary direct telephone call to the Personnel Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways, they accepted us. The Personnel Department of the Jinan Railway Administration spent three days studying our materials, and during these three days our meals were not resolved. On the afternoon of the third day, the Personnel Department said, "The Personnel Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways called and said that the Translation Office of the Ministry of Railways needs someone, and they want one comrade to return." So, I was transferred back to Beijing. After I returned to the Personnel Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways, they first prepared to send me to Tianjin Technical School to work, and later they reassigned me to Jinzhou Railway Bureau Technical School, which was said to be "most in need of Russian teachers." However, after I arrived at Jinzhou Railway Bureau Technical School on August 19th, I learned that all seven classes of students here will graduate in July next year. The Education Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, in order to take care of the students' professional studies, has decided not to offer Russian classes this year. Therefore, I have to wait a year before I can teach Russian.
    The above situation shows that the Personnel Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways is treating the allocation of jobs to graduates with a bureaucratic attitude. I request the Personnel Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways to reassign my job, and I hope that the Central Personnel Department and the Central Ministry of Railways can earnestly investigate the above issues.
    Editor's note: The opinions raised by reader Luo Chaochen are worthy of attention. According to letters from other readers, the Personnel Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways lacked planning when allocating jobs to graduates of the Russian Department of Harbin Railway Institute this year. For example, similar situations have occurred for graduates assigned to Shanghai by the bureau. Therefore, we believe that the Central Personnel Department and the Central Ministry of Railways need to investigate this issue thoroughly.

### 中央铁道部人事局分配毕业生工作缺乏计划

专栏：读者来信摘要

    中央铁道部人事局
    分配毕业生工作缺乏计划
    读者罗朝臣来信：我是哈尔滨铁道学院本届俄文系毕业生。八月十三日，我和其他几个同学经中央铁道部人事局分配，到济南铁路管理局去工作。不料，济南铁路管理局人事处竟不知道有这件事，经临时挂直通电话和中央铁道部人事局联系，才接收了我们。济南铁路管理局人事处研究我们的材料花了三天时间，在这三天内我们的吃饭问题也得不到解决。第三天下午，人事处说：“中央铁道部人事局来电话说，铁道部翻译处需要一个人，要一个同志回去。”这样，我又被调回北京。我回到中央铁道部人事局后，他们先准备派我到天津技术学校工作，后来又把我改派到据说是“最需要俄文教员”的锦州铁路局技术学校去。但是，八月十九日我到达锦州铁路局技术学校后，才知道这里七个班的学生全部在明年七月毕业，铁道部教育局为了照顾同学的专业学习，已决定本年度不开俄文课。这样，我得等待一年才能有俄文可教。
    以上情况说明，中央铁道部人事局是以官僚主义的态度来对待分配毕业生工作的。我要求中央铁道部人事局重新分配我的工作，并希望中央人事部和中央铁道部能切实检查以上问题。
    编者按：读者罗朝臣所提意见是值得注意的。根据其他读者来信反映：中央铁道部人事局在分配哈尔滨铁道学院本届俄文系毕业生工作时是缺乏计划的，如该局分配到上海去的毕业生也有类似情况发生。因此，我们认为中央人事部和中央铁道部有必要深入检查这个问题。
