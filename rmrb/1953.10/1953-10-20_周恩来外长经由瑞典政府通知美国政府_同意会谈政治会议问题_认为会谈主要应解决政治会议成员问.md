(Xinhua News Agency, 19th) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China received on October 14, 1953, a notification from the U.S. government via the Swedish government, delivered by the Swedish Embassy in China, regarding the political conference. Premier Zhou Enlai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government submitted a response to the aforementioned notification on October 19, 1953, which was sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Swedish Embassy, requesting it to forward the response to the Swedish government and then to the U.S. government. On the same evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government also telegraphed Premier Zhou Enlai's aforementioned notification to Mr. Hammarskjöld, Secretary-General of the United Nations, requesting him to forward it to Mrs. Pandit, President of the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and requesting Mrs. Pandit to distribute it to all United Nations member states attending the United Nations General Assembly, except for the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group.

At the same time, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea received the aforementioned U.S. government notification regarding the political conference, forwarded by the Swedish government. Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea also submitted a similar response notification on October 19, 1953. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea entrusted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Republic of China to forward Foreign Minister Nam Il's aforementioned notification to the Swedish government and then to the U.S. government. On the same day, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government forwarded Foreign Minister Nam Il's aforementioned notification to the Swedish Embassy.

The full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's notification is as follows:

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has taken note of and jointly studied with the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea the notification forwarded by the U.S. government via the Swedish government on October 14, 1953.

I am now authorized to notify on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China as follows:

(1) In its notification of October 14, the U.S. government insisted that General Nam Il, Chief Delegate of the Korean-Chinese Armistice Negotiation Delegation, had previously insisted that the participants in the political conference should be limited to the relevant governments of both sides. This is completely untrue. When the fifth agenda item of the Korean Armistice Negotiations was underway in February 1952, the negotiating representatives of the United Nations Command attempted to include the vast majority of United Nations member states that had not participated in the Korean War as the opposing party of the Korean warring parties. Therefore, in the discussion process, General Nam Il explicitly defined the meaning of the term "relevant governments on both sides of the belligerent parties" as: the governments of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China on one side, and the relevant governments of the United Nations Command on the other side; and pointed out that the vast majority of member states of the United Nations that had not participated in the Korean War should not be listed as the opposing parties of the Korean warring parties. This explanation was also agreed upon by Major General Joy, spokesman for the United Nations Command at the time. Throughout the armistice negotiations, the Korean-Chinese negotiating delegation never advocated that other relevant neutral countries should not participate in the political conference. Moreover, it is impossible to conclude from Article 60 of the Korean Armistice Agreement that the political conference must exclude the participation of other relevant neutral countries. Furthermore, Resolution (B) passed by the United Nations General Assembly at its 430th meeting also recognized that the Soviet Union, which was not one of the belligerent parties, could participate in the political conference; this shows that the principle that the members of the political conference should not be limited to the belligerent parties has been agreed upon by the vast majority of the United Nations member states. Therefore, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that its consistent position that the political conference should have relevant neutral countries other than the Korean warring parties—especially relevant neutral countries in Asia—participating, is completely correct.

(2) Based on the above, the United Nations General Assembly should have accepted the suggestions of the Chinese and Korean governments in their telegrams to Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on September 13 and 14, respectively, to recommend the entire membership of the political conference, including the belligerent parties and other relevant neutral countries. However, the United Nations General Assembly succumbed to the will of a few countries, violated the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, and rejected the reasonable suggestions of the Chinese and Korean sides. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China cannot but express its deep regret once again.

(3) Based on our principled attitude towards the political conference issue, and taking into account the desire of the people of the world for a swift convening of the political conference, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, after consultation with the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, agrees to jointly dispatch representatives to meet with U.S. representatives in Panmunjom on October 26 to conduct talks on the political conference issue.

(4) The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that this meeting can include the resolution of the issues of the location and time of the political conference, as well as various procedural, administrative, and arrangement-related issues as proposed in the U.S. government's notification. However, the Central People's Government still believes that the more important issue to be resolved in this meeting is the membership of the political conference. To this end, the Central People's Government specifically declares that it reserves the right to raise, discuss and resolve the issue of the membership of the political conference in this meeting.

    周恩来外长经由瑞典政府通知美国政府
    同意会谈政治会议问题
    认为会谈主要应解决政治会议成员问题
    【新华社十九日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部，在一九五三年十月十四日接到驻我国的瑞典大使馆交来的美国政府经由瑞典政府致送的关于政治会议的通知一件。我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长在一九五三年十月十九日对上述通知提出了答复通知，由外交部送致瑞典大使馆，请它转致瑞典政府然后转致美国政府。同日晚，我中央人民政府外交部并已将周恩来部长的上述通知用电报拍给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德先生，请他转致联合国第八届大会主席潘迪特夫人，并请潘迪特夫人分发给除中国国民党反动残余集团外的所有出席联合国大会的联合国会员国。
    与此同时，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府接到了瑞典政府转交的上述美国政府关于政治会议的通知。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府外务省南日外务相也已在一九五三年十月十九日提出了同样的答复通知。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省委托中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部将南日外务相的上述通知转致瑞典政府然后转致美国政府。同日，我中央人民政府外交部已将南日外务相的上述通知转致瑞典大使馆。
    周恩来外长的通知全文如下：
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府已经注意到了、并已与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府共同研究了美国政府经由瑞典政府于一九五三年十月十四日转来的通知。
    我现在受权代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府通知如下：
    （一）美国政府在其十月十四日的通知中，硬说朝中停战谈判代表团首席代表南日大将过去曾经坚持过政治会议的参加者应该仅限于双方有关政府。这是完全不合乎事实的。当一九五二年二月朝鲜停战谈判第五项议程正在进行之时，联合国军方面谈判代表力图将并未参加朝鲜战争的绝大多数联合国会员国列入朝鲜交战双方中的敌对一方，因此，南日大将在讨论过程中，曾经将“敌对双方有关各国政府”一辞的含意明确肯定为：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国两国政府为一方，联合国军有关各国政府为另一方；并指出不应把联合国中绝大多数未曾参加朝鲜战争的会员国列为朝鲜交战双方中的敌对一方。这个解释当时也曾为联合国军发言人乔埃中将所同意。朝中谈判代表团在整个停战谈判的过程中，从来就没有主张过政治会议不应该有其他有关中立国家参加。从朝鲜停战协定第六十款中，也根本不可能得出政治会议必须排斥其他有关中立国家参加的结论。而且，就在联合国大会第四三○次会议所通过的决议案（乙）中，也承认并非交战双方之一的苏联可以参加政治会议；足见政治会议成员之不应仅限于交战双方的原则，是联合国会员国中绝大多数所已经同意了的。因此，中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为它所始终坚持的政治会议应该有朝鲜交战双方之外的有关中立国家——特别是亚洲有关中立国家——参加的主张，是完全正确的。
    （二）根据上述，联合国大会本应接受中朝两国政府在九月十三日和十四日先后覆哈马舍尔德秘书长的电文中的建议，来推荐组成政治会议的全体成员，包括交战双方及其他有关中立国家在内；但联合国大会竟屈从少数国家的意旨，违背联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，拒绝了中朝方面的合理建议。中华人民共和国中央人民政府对此不能不再度表示深切遗憾。
    （三）根据我们对政治会议问题所采取的原则性的态度，并考虑到全世界人民热望迅速召开政治会议的要求，中华人民共和国中央人民政府在与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府协商之后，同意共同派遣代表于十月二十六日在板门店与美国代表会晤，进行关于政治会议问题的会谈。
    （四）中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为，在这一会谈中，可以包括美国政府通知中所提出的解决政治会议的地点和时间问题，以及有关程序的、行政管理的和安排方面的各项问题；但中央人民政府仍然认为，在这一会谈中更主要的还是应当解决政治会议的成员问题。为此，中央人民政府特声明保留在这一会谈中提出讨论和解决政治会议成员问题的权利。
