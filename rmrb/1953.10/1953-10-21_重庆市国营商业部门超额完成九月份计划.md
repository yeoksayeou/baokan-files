Chongqing's state-owned commercial departments overfulfilled their September purchase and sales plans in the increased production and economy campaign.

After the Chongqing Municipal People's Government Commerce Bureau mobilized the city's commercial departments on September 15 to launch an increased production and economy movement, each specialized company, on the basis of ensuring the completion of the annual plan, formulated specific competition targets and action plans to accelerate commodity circulation and reduce circulation costs. They also mobilized the masses to put forward rationalization proposals and convened various professional meetings to carefully calculate accounts and tap potential from various specific links. Since the start of the competition, the Oils and Fats Company had submitted 182 rationalization proposals by the end of September and came up with many ways to save commodity circulation costs. The company estimates that the loading and unloading costs of oils and fats transported from Chengdu to Chongqing in the fourth quarter alone can be reduced by seventy or eighty million yuan. The Trade Company strengthened the organization of goods and went deep into the producing areas to sign purchase and sales contracts. Many department stores adjusted labor organization and extended business hours. The Grain Company held meetings of custodians and laboratory personnel to implement seasonal grain storage plans and reduce grain losses. The competition movement improved the work efficiency of various departments. The Transportation and Electrical Equipment Company strengthened the connection and cooperation between accounting, warehousing, procurement, sales, and promotion units, initially overcoming the phenomenon of mutual restraint and disconnection. The Accounting Section of the Oils and Fats Company also created a new method for calculating commodity costs, reducing the time for calculating profits from one and a half days to only twenty or thirty minutes.

Each department, according to its own competition targets, formulated action plans and individual guarantee conditions, launching challenges and acceptances to each other, and overfulfilled the September plan. The city's state-owned commercial departments' sales plan (excluding purchases from the company's own system and supply stations) increased by 28.47 percent compared with August, completing 111.57 percent of the September plan; the purchase plan increased by 47.04 percent compared with August, completing 120.43 percent of the September plan.

At present, the development of the increased production and economy movement is not yet balanced, and the staff and workers of individual units have not been fully mobilized. The Municipal Commerce Bureau has decided to further educate staff and workers to clearly understand the great significance of increased production and economy through checking the implementation of the September plan and discussing the October plan, so as to deepen the movement.

    重庆市国营商业部门超额完成九月份计划
    重庆市国营商业部门在增产节约竞赛中，超额完成了九月份的购销计划。
    九月十五日，重庆市人民政府商业局动员全市商业部门开展增产节约运动以后，各专业公司在保证完成年计划的基础上，均订出了加速商品流转和降低流转费用的具体竞赛指标和行动计划，并发动群众提合理化建议，召开各种专业会议，从各个具体环节上算细账、挖潜力。油脂公司自开展竞赛后，至九月底提出合理化建议一百八十二件，想出了许多节省商品流转费用的办法，仅第四季度由成都运到重庆的油脂装卸搬运费用即可节省七、八千万元；贸易公司加强组织货源，深入产地订立购销合同；许多百货公司调整劳动组织，延长了营业时间，粮食公司召开了保管和化验人员会议，贯彻各季保管粮食计划，减少粮食损耗。竞赛运动中使各部门提高了工作效率。交通电工器材公司加强了记账、保管、采购、营业、推销各单位之间的联系配合，初步克服了互相牵制和脱节的现象。油脂公司会计科并创造了一种新的计算商品成本的办法，计算利润时间由原来一天半缩减至二、三十分钟就够了。
    各部门根据自己竞赛指标，订出行动计划和个人保证条件，互相掀起了挑战应战，超额完成了九月份计划。全市国营商业部门销售计划（不包括公司本系统和供应站进货）较八月份增加百分之二十八点四七，完成九月份计划百分之一百一十一点五七；购进计划较八月份增加百分之四十七点零四；完成九月份计划百分之一百二十点四三。
    目前增产节约运动的发展还不够平衡，个别单位职工还没有充分发动起来，市商业局决定通过检查九月份计划执行情况和讨论十月份计划，进一步教育职工明确认识增产节约的重大意义，使运动深入开展下去。
