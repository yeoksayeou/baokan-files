The joint state-private Hwasin Cement Factory has seen significant development in recent years. The cement produced by this factory has been selling well throughout the country, playing an important role in national construction. According to statistics, 224 units placed orders with the factory in the first half of this year, including municipal construction departments in the capital, the Huai River Harnessing Committee, the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Committee, transportation construction departments in the Northwest, and the Nanling Coal Mine in South China. Some newly built and expanded factories in East China and Southwest China have also successively ordered high-quality cement from this factory. The completed Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project sluice gates, the South Dongting Lake water conservancy project, and the Huainan Nanwan Reservoir project were also constructed entirely or mostly using cement produced by this factory.

Before liberation, the Hwasin Cement Factory was jointly operated by bureaucratic capital and private capital. In 1948, on the eve of the total collapse of the Kuomintang, the factory could not sell even the 300 to 400 tons of cement produced during trial production, and the factory's construction and production came to a standstill. The livelihoods of all employees could not be maintained. After liberation, the People's Government took over the bureaucratic capital portion of the factory and implemented joint state-private operation with private shares, making large investments and enabling the Hwasin Cement Factory to achieve rapid recovery and development. Now, all the factory's machinery has been installed and put into production. The original temporary wooden structures have also been rebuilt into permanent steel structures or steel-concrete hybrid structures. The newly built cement and raw material grinding workshops stand majestically in the center of the factory area. In the scenic areas around the factory, tens of thousands of square meters of newly built employee dormitories, canteens, and children's schools are neatly distributed. Due to the gradual improvement of equipment and the increasing enthusiasm of employees, the factory's production has rapidly increased year by year. For example, if the factory's cement production in 1950 is taken as 100, then it was 318 in 1951, 333 in 1952, and has increased to 469 this year.

With the development of production, the shareholders of the Hwasin Cement Factory have also obtained the deserved annual increase in profits. For example, the total amount of dividends paid in 1952 was more than twice that of 1950. Seeing that the factory had state leadership and production was thriving after liberation, the private shareholders' enthusiasm for management also increased. In 1951, when the factory carried out basic construction investment, some private shareholders also invested. Currently, the Hwasin Cement Factory is starting its five-year construction plan. It is expected that in the near future, its cement production and quality will be further improved.

    公私合营华新水泥厂几年来生产迅速发展
    公私合营的华新水泥厂几年来有很大的发展。这个厂出产的水泥已畅销全国，对国家建设事业起了重要的作用，据统计：今年上半年向该厂订货的单位共有二百二十四个，其中包括首都的市政建设部门，治淮委员会，长江水利委员会，西北的交通建设部门，华南的南岭煤矿。华东和西南的一些新建和扩建的工厂，也先后在该厂订购到质量优良的水泥。我国已经建成的荆江分洪工程的水闸、南洞庭湖水利工程和淮南南湾水库等工程，也都是全部或大部使用该厂出产的水泥建造的。
    华新水泥厂在解放以前是由官僚资本和私人资本合股经营的，一九四八年国民党总崩溃的前夕，该厂连试车生产的三四百吨水泥也无法销售，工厂兴建工程和生产都陷于停顿。全体职工生活无法维持。解放后，人民政府接收了这个厂的官僚资本部分，与私股实行公私合营，并大量投资，使华新水泥厂获得了迅速的恢复和发展。现在，该厂的全部机器早已安装起来，投入了生产，原来临时性的木结构建筑，也改建为永久性的钢铁结构或钢铁混凝土混合结构的建筑。新建的水泥和生料磨的厂房已巍峨地耸立在厂区中心。在厂区周围风景优美的地方，整齐地分布着新建的成万平方公尺的职工宿舍、食堂和子弟学校。由于设备的逐步完善，职工劳动热情的日益高涨，该厂生产就逐年迅速提高。如以该厂一九五零年水泥产量为一百，那末，一九五一年为三百一十八，一九五二年为三百三十三，今年更增长为四百六十九。
    随着生产的发展，华新水泥厂的股东们也获得了应有的逐年提高的利益。例如一九五二年的股息发给总额，就比一九五零年提高了两倍多。私股的股东们看到工厂在解放后有了公股领导，生产蒸蒸日上，经营热情也提高了。一九五一年该厂进行基本建设投资时，部分私股股东也进行了投资。目前，华新水泥厂正在开始它的五年建设计划，预计不久的将来，它的水泥产量和质量，将会更进一步的提高。
