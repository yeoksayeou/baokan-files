　　“Doesn't Count for Much”
　　Richard Crossman, an influential politician of the British Labour Party, recently gave a speech in Warwickshire, England. He expressed regret that Dulles would rather listen to Syngman Rhee and Adenauer than to British Prime Minister Churchill, and he said with emotion: "Churchill doesn't count for much in Washington now." In fact, in the eyes of Wall Street, "Churchill doesn't count for much," not just now, but for a long time. This Labour politician seems to have forgotten what happened just last winter. At that time, Churchill ran to the United States, and as soon as he landed, he was stopped by agents of the US immigration authorities. All of his entourage were subjected to interrogation, and the Prime Minister of Great Britain was only "spared by a hair."

　　Mutual Distrust
　　According to a United Press report from Sydney, the British government has decided to conduct an atomic weapons test in the central desert region of Australia in October, and said that according to strict confidentiality regulations, no American ground observers will be allowed to observe it, nor will American journalists be allowed to visit it, only British and Australian journalists will be allowed to watch. As early as mid-September, British Minister of Supply Duncan Sandys also announced this ban. The bosses of Wall Street keep saying that Britain is its best "ally", but it has a law that it does not exchange major intelligence about atomic weapons with Britain, to which Britain is of course greatly dissatisfied. This time it seems to be Britain's turn to show America a bit of a face.

　　France's Sorrow
　　Three years ago, France signed an agreement with the United States, allowing the United States to build five air force bases in Morocco, and also allowing 7,500 American troops to be stationed at these air force bases. However, the insatiable United States is not satisfied. According to an Associated Press report on October 8, American officials said: "This number of people will soon be insufficient", "a large increase in troops is needed, perhaps doubling the 7,500 people currently permitted by the Franco-American agreement." And France? Because it has discovered that "the Americans are interfering in local politics" and because of "fear of the increase of American power in Morocco," it still does not allow the United States to continue to increase its troops. Even a U.S. government official in Morocco said: "The French really think we are going to take over this colony." A French official admitted: "Morocco is one of France's most vulnerable spots."

　　Such "Friendship"
　　The United States and its "friends" do business together, calling it "friendship," but in reality, they are taking advantage of the situation. The New Zealand newspaper "People's Voice" listed ten typical "US-New Zealand joint venture" companies with a total capital of approximately 3.5 million pounds as examples, saying that American monopoly capitalists control 99% of all the shares of these companies, while New Zealanders own only 1% of the shares. And in the "New Zealand Mobil Oil Company" with a capital of one million pounds, New Zealanders only own two New Zealand pounds of symbolic capital. The New Zealand bourgeoisie, which is currently being squeezed and threatened, is no longer very welcoming of this "friendship," and certain factions are opposing American control.

　　Lackey Beats Master
　　According to a United Press report from Belgrade on October 10, in order to turn the port of Trieste between Italy and Yugoslavia into its military base, the United States has colluded with Britain to secretly decide to hand over Zone A of the port of Trieste to Italy. According to the provisions of the peace treaty with Italy, the port of Trieste should establish a free zone and should not be given to Italy or Yugoslavia. This barbaric decision by the United States is a very infuriating matter for the Tito government of Yugoslavia, which has long coveted the free zone. On October 10, three divisions of Tito's army moved to the boundary line between the two zones, and Yugoslav warships were also concentrated on the coast of Zone B of the port of Trieste. Tito warned the United States to rescind this decision. On the 11th, the United States also sent three destroyers to the port of Trieste and threatened to stop aid to Tito. But Tito still did not yield. On the 12th, William King, the director of the US Information Service in Belgrade, was beaten up by Tito's followers.

    美国和它的“朋友”
    “不算什么了”
    英国工党一个有势力的政治家理查德·克罗斯曼，不久以前在英国的瓦尔威克郡作了一次演说：他对杜勒斯宁愿听从李承晚和阿登纳的话，而不愿听从英国首相邱吉尔的话表示遗憾，他感慨地说：“目前在华盛顿，邱吉尔已不算什么了”。其实，在华尔街眼中，“邱吉尔已不算什么”，岂止目前，应该说由来已久了。这位工党政治家似乎忘记了就在去年冬天发生的事。当时邱吉尔跑到美国，一上岸就被美国移民当局的特务们所挡驾，他的全部随员挨个受到了审查，这位大不列颠的首相不过“仅以身免”而已。
    互不信任
    据合众社自悉尼报道：英国政府决定十月在澳大利亚的中央沙漠区，作一次原子武器的爆炸试验，并且说根据严格的保密条例，不让美国的地面观察员去观察，也不让美国的记者去参观，只允许英国和澳大利亚的记者去看。早在九月中旬，英国供应大臣邓肯·桑迪斯也宣布过这条禁令。华尔街的老板口口声声说英国是它最要好的“盟国”，但是它却有这样一条立法：不与英国交换关于原子武器的主要情报，英国对此当然是大大不满。这一次似乎轮到英国给美国瞧瞧脸色了。
    法国的悲哀
    三年前，法国曾与美国签订了一个协定，允许美国在摩洛哥建筑五个空军基地，同时允许在这些空军基地上驻扎七千五百名美军。可是，贪得无厌的美国并不满足，据美联社十月八日的报道，美国官员们说：“这个数目的人不久就要不够了”，“需要大量增加军队，或许要把目前法美协定所准许的七千五百人增加一倍”。而法国呢？由于它发现“美国人在干涉当地的政治”，由于“惧怕美国势力在摩洛哥增涨”，直到现在还不允许美国继续增加军队。甚至在摩洛哥的一个美国政府官员也说：“法国人真正认为我们要把这个殖民地拿过来”。一个法国官员则承认：“摩洛哥是法国的一个最脆弱的地方。”
    如此“友谊”
    美国和它的“朋友”合伙做生意，说是“友谊”，实际上却在乘火打劫。新西兰“人民之声报”列举了资本额共约三百五十万英镑的十家典型的“美国、新西兰合营”公司作例子说：美国垄断资本家控制了这些公司的全部股票的百分之九十九，新西兰人所占的股票只有百分之一。而在资本额一百万镑的“新西兰美孚石油公司”中，新西兰人仅仅占有两个新西兰镑的象征性股本。目前受到排挤和威胁的新西兰资产阶级已经不大欢迎这种“友谊”了，有某些派系正在反对美国的控制。
    奴才痛击主子
    但据合众社贝尔格莱德十月十日的消息，美国为了要把意大利和南斯拉夫之间的的里雅斯特港变为它的军事基地，已串通英国暗地决定了将的里雅斯特港甲区交给意大利。依照对意和约的规定，的里雅斯特港应建立自由区，不应给予意大利或是南斯拉夫。美国这一横蛮的决定，对早已垂涎自由区的南斯拉夫铁托政府是一件十分恼火的事。十月十日，三师铁托军队开到了两区的分界线，南斯拉夫军舰也在的里雅斯特港乙区海岸集中。铁托警告美国，要它撤销这个决定。十一日，美国也将三艘驱逐舰开到的里雅斯特港，并以停止对铁托的援助相威胁。但铁托仍未就范，到十二日，住在贝尔格莱德的美国新闻处处长威廉·金，遭到铁托分子一顿痛击。
