Cultivating Industrial Workers and Revolutionary Cadres: Methods and Paths for Advanced Construction Talent
Hu Xikui

      I. New Era and New Tasks

    Since our country is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and the working class is the leading class of the country, cultivating worker-peasant cadres to become construction cadres of the working class itself with culture and knowledge is a serious political task of higher education in the new China. For decades in the past, higher education in China served imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and thus it was divorced from the laboring people, who were fundamentally unable to enter the gates of universities. The higher education of the new China must first serve the workers and peasants. As Comrade Stalin pointed out in "New Environment and New Tasks of Economic Construction": "We do not need just any kind of industrial commanding personnel and engineering and technical personnel. What we need are those who can understand the policies of our working class, can comprehend these policies, and are determined to sincerely implement them. And what does this mean? It means that our country has entered such a stage of development, at this time the working class should create its own production and technical intelligentsia, that is, the production and technical intelligentsia that can safeguard the interests of its ruling class in production." "The Soviet regime has noticed this, so it has tried its best to absorb working-class elements into higher schools in various departments of the national economy to study. You know that there are hundreds of thousands of young workers and peasants studying in higher schools in our country now. In the past, under the capitalist system, higher schools were exclusively occupied by young masters and sons of officials, while now under the Soviet system, young workers and peasants are the dominant force in higher schools. There is no doubt that in the near future we will be able to obtain from our higher schools thousands of new technicians and engineers, new commanders of our industry." It can be seen that the road that higher education in the new China should follow—the road of cultivating worker-peasant intellectuals to become advanced construction talents (including industrial command or management talents and technical talents, the two should not be neglected)—is the victorious and correct road that Soviet socialist construction has already taken. Of course, the cultural heritage we have inherited is backward, and we may encounter many twists and turns and difficulties on this road forward. We must advance steadily and in a planned way, but at the same time, we are not allowed to hesitate and stop moving forward on this road.

    Since its establishment in 1950, Renmin University of China has, according to the instructions of the Central Committee, focused on cultivating worker-peasant cadres. In addition to absorbing progressive young intellectuals to participate in the study, it has also absorbed a large number of industrial workers and revolutionary cadres to enroll. In the past few years, the student composition of our school has been about 70% industrial workers and revolutionary cadres, including a group of labor models and combat heroes. Their academic performance is generally good, and their progress is relatively fast.

    In the past three years, a total of 4,587 students have graduated from undergraduate and specialized courses at Renmin University of China. Among them, 443 students from the six departments of economic planning, statistics, factory management (renamed as the Department of Industrial Economics this year), finance, credit and loan, trade, and cooperation graduated this year. Industrial workers accounted for 12%, revolutionary cadres accounted for 60%, and young intellectuals accounted for 28%. This group of students not only has good composition and political quality, but also has undergone long-term formal education and strict graduation examinations. They have specialized skills, and have initially mastered the weapons of Marxism-Leninism and advanced Soviet science, as well as the experience of socialist construction for more than 30 years. Therefore, not only has the slogan of "intellectualizing worker-peasant elements" been basically realized, but also they generally have the scientific level of construction talents needed by the state. This is a new event in the history of higher education in China, and this matter has attracted the attention of relevant departments. Most of the graduates are assigned by the Central Personnel Department to work in various business departments and factories and mines according to the needs and the principle of "applying what they have learned"; at the same time, some of the graduates who study better stay in our school as formal graduate students (i.e., relatively advanced graduate students). Among these graduate students, such as the mechanical class, metallurgical class, coal mining class, and textile class of the Department of Industrial Economics, except for individual young intellectuals, are all railway lathe workers, metal machinery factory fitters, coal mining or textile workers. There are also many industrial workers and revolutionary cadres in the formal graduate students of other financial and economic departments. All this proves that cultivating worker-peasant intellectuals into advanced construction talents is not only necessary for national construction, but also possible. However, to implement this policy and task, on the one hand, it is necessary to fight against the view of underestimating worker-peasant students, earnestly solve their difficulties in learning, and give them due guarantees in life; on the other hand, it is also necessary to oppose the tendency of excessively lowering the admission standards simply because of the subjective desire for workers to study, otherwise it will also create waste products and detours.

      II. Main Difficulties and
          Favorable Conditions for Overcoming Difficulties

    In the past three years, Renmin University of China has enrolled a large number of workers and cadres directly into undergraduate studies. Generally, they have a cultural level equivalent to junior high school (this year, due to the large proportion of cadres transferred from the army and students graduated from preparatory courses and worker-peasant rapid middle schools, the cultural level of students when they enter school has improved to a certain extent). At the same time, their knowledge of Chinese language, mathematics, physics, and chemistry varies, which has become a common and most basic shortcoming of these students. Precisely because of this shortcoming, it will inevitably bring some practical difficulties to the teaching work of universities; but at the same time, there are also favorable conditions for overcoming these difficulties. That is, they have a certain degree of political consciousness, a sense of responsibility for learning, they believe that this is a glorious task entrusted to them by the Party and the state, maintain a constant full of learning enthusiasm and initiative, and also have a certain revolutionary struggle experience and production knowledge, and have a strong understanding. Both aspects must be sufficiently estimated, so as not to produce overly high demands or pessimistic disappointment. Our teaching work is to give full play to its favorable conditions to overcome difficulties. In terms of administrative leadership and teachers, we must carefully study the characteristics of their learning, strengthen the leadership and help for their learning, that is: (1) The leadership should give them support and help, mainly to appropriately increase the proportion of cultural foundation courses such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and Chinese language in the teaching plan, take care of them in all aspects, solve their difficulties in learning, and carry out strict education to encourage them to move forward. (2) Teachers should provide patient and effective help, and constantly create teaching methods suitable for new situations, especially the special active guidance of teachers, and enthusiastically hand over valuable scientific knowledge to students, fully demonstrating the characteristics of people's teachers, and becoming the most reliable force for students to overcome difficulties. (3) At the beginning of school, due to the class friendship and labor mutual assistance between students, those with more knowledge help those with less knowledge, senior students help new students, and advanced students help backward students, inheriting the glorious tradition of mutual support in learning in the old liberated areas. After a considerable period of time, they have a certain foundation, and gradually guide them to develop the habit of independent study and self-study ability, and improve their learning one step further. This is also an assistance to overcome difficulties. (4) Calling on and organizing students to actively participate in physical health and hygiene activities is a powerful guarantee for overcoming difficulties and completing the learning plan. In the past, there were also people who disregarded their health, disregarded the school's regulations, or did not actively participate in physical health and hygiene activities, and simply and one-sidedly engaged in learning by rote; as a result, their bodies were damaged, and their studies were not good. On the contrary, those who pay attention to physical exercise and actively participate in sports and hygiene activities generate a practical force for improving learning and overcoming difficulties. For example, Han Zhendong, a student in the mechanical class of the second grade of the Department of Industrial Economics, is a worker at the Tangshan Railway Machinery Factory. When he came to school, he actively participated in the physical exercise of the "Beijing Higher Education Institutions 1952 Physical Exercise Standards" and won the Excellent Award. It is precisely because his body is well exercised that his academic performance is not only not behind, but also often maintains excellence. This is a powerful proof of "good health, good learning, and good work." Due to the advantages of workers and cadres and the constant help from the leadership to overcome the difficulties in learning, especially the difficulties in the cultural foundation in the early stage, the possibility of cultivating worker-peasant intellectuals to become advanced construction talents has gradually become a reality with the gradual deepening and improvement of theoretical and professional learning, through two production internships and graduation examinations. But it must be pointed out that this is only laying a preliminary scientific foundation, and there should be no pride or complacency. We should always be vigilant: "The enemy of learning is our own satisfaction." Whether working and learning in any agency, enterprise, or school, we must be modest and diligent, strengthen learning, and delve into business, and continue to move forward on the basis of continuous improvement.

      III. Methods and Steps

    In order to effectively implement the policy of opening higher education to workers and peasants, and to more effectively cultivate worker-peasant intellectuals, Renmin University of China has adopted the following methods and steps:

    (1) According to the instructions of the Central Committee on the establishment of Renmin University of China in 1950, the admission standards are that all industrial workers and revolutionary cadres with a cultural level equivalent to junior high school (progressive young intellectuals must have a cultural level above high school) can be recruited. In the current specific situation in China, this is suitable for the requirements of industrial workers and revolutionary cadres to enter school; if the admission standards for such students are to be raised to the level of high school, they will inevitably still be pushed out of the school gate. There are indeed many difficulties and troubles in enrolling them, but experience has proven that difficulties can be overcome, troubles are unavoidable in any revolutionary work, and there is no reason to refuse them to enter university undergraduates; therefore, we still insist on implementing this policy of the Central Committee, in addition to not lowering our admission cultural conditions, we must also ensure good health, progressive thinking, and age under 30.

    In order to ensure the quality and source of students, we solve it from two aspects, that is, on the one hand, we directly recruit undergraduate students (specialized courses are provided by relevant business departments for in-service cadres above the section chief level to take rotational training), on the other hand, we continuously expand the reserve army from the affiliated preparatory courses and worker-peasant rapid middle schools. The admission level of preparatory courses is lower than that of universities and higher than that of worker-peasant rapid middle schools. Under the circumstances that the school system of worker-peasant rapid middle schools cannot be changed, preparatory courses have a transitional nature. In the future, this reserve force should be further expanded on the existing basis in order to better ensure the quantity and quality of workers and cadres entering school.

    (2) In addition to the teaching plan taking into account the uneven level of students and making arrangements, the content and methods of teaching cannot be completely adopted at one pace or one method, because we currently actually have two different levels of students. Progressive young intellectuals who graduated from high school have a higher cultural level and a lower political level, and their proportion is relatively small. Workers and revolutionary cadres have a higher political level and a lower cultural level, and their proportion is relatively large. It is necessary to adopt different paces and methods to solve the problem. The main thing is the cultural foundation courses, the time is short, the requirements are high, but the level of students is uneven; therefore, in the content of these courses, in addition to adopting different paces for teaching, it is also appropriate to reduce them and compile a set of teaching materials and lecture notes that combine professional teaching of cultural foundation courses. Students with a higher level can also study according to the cultural course system (such as advanced mathematics). In terms of teaching methods, the systematic unit teaching method can be adopted according to professional needs. The content is less and more refined, from concrete to abstract, from shallow to deep. We must be good at using the language and life examples of workers and peasants to explain, use more physical charts for teaching, give universal lectures, highlight the key points, talk less, practice more, and use the cycle memory method. When talking about new units, try to insert problems from old units, use more familiar examples, not too fast, to be proficient, and to consolidate, to achieve the purpose of gradual improvement.

    (3) Workers and cadres lack the habit of formal study. Many of them have the experience of "single-handedly fighting," are accustomed to informal discussions, and have certain ideological concerns and resistance to the formal study system and organization. Therefore, first of all, we must stabilize their ideological emotions, improve their confidence in learning, and according to the timetable, the teaching progress of each subject, the number of internship assignments, and the difficulty of students' acceptance of the course itself, help them formulate weekly study plans, so that they can review their homework while their memory is still fresh. At this time, developing the habit of learning is a very important link. With a study plan, they can ensure the simultaneous progress of the learning effects of each subject, so that they can have a clear idea and be organized, and establish confidence in continuous improvement in learning. Then, according to the difficulties of workers and cadres in learning, each teaching and research office considers organizing individual and collective tutoring in various forms to guide them to delve into and improve their learning effectiveness.

      IV. A Few Experiences

    (1) The teaching practice of Renmin University of China in the past three years has proved that the Central Committee's policy of cultivating worker-peasant cadres to become national advanced construction talents is completely correct. Because worker-peasant cadres have a certain political awareness, struggle experience, and production knowledge, after a considerable period of formal education, their perceptual knowledge is raised to rational knowledge, and theory is combined with practice, it is possible to become the backbone of national advanced construction and play a greater efficiency for the country's economic construction. They can not only generally become advanced construction backbones, but also can be trained to become scientific workers. The workers and cadres who graduated from Renmin University of China this year have been welcomed by all parties. Many people have worked as factory directors, mine managers, or department directors and section chiefs above the functional sections and offices of planning and management of ministry bureaus and enterprises, and some have also served as cadre theoretical education and scientific work. This is the most eloquent fact that powerfully proves this possibility. Therefore, it is a matter of great significance for various business departments, factories, and mines to select a group of outstanding workers and cadres to study in universities for the long-term interests of the national construction cause.

    (2) There are many ways for workers and cadres to enter universities. They can either go through the study of rapid middle schools or preparatory courses, or they can go through the study of training classes and technical classes in factories and mines, and then enter universities; or they can be selected by factories, mines, and various business departments to directly enter universities. Therefore, the way for workers and cadres to enter universities does not necessarily have to go through the stage of worker-peasant rapid middle schools; of course, in order to ensure the growth of the reserve force of university students, worker-peasant rapid middle schools must continue to expand enrollment, and at the same time, in terms of cultural conditions for worker-peasant cadres to enter school, it should not be mechanically and excessively emphasized that they must all have a high school graduation level. The educational experience of Renmin University of China in the past three years tells us that workers and cadres with a level equivalent to junior high school have the possibility of pursuing undergraduate studies. Although the starting point of learning in cultural foundation courses may be lower when entering school, due to their active efforts in learning, they can still achieve the purpose of improvement in the end; and the quality of their training is generally not worse than that of young intellectuals who graduated from high school and entered university. On the contrary, the academic performance of many worker-peasant cadres even exceeds that of young intellectuals, and it is also relatively solid.

    (3) To ensure that workers and cadres study well, in addition to taking effective measures in general teaching, we must also pay attention to their daily ideological education, so that they more actively maintain a constant full of learning enthusiasm. We should always care about their health and living conditions, and appropriately take care of and solve their difficulties in life under possible conditions; but the requirements for their learning must be strict, especially the education of labor models and combat heroes must be firmly grasped, and external social activities and receptions should be reduced as much as possible. All students who hold concurrent positions (outside the school) generally decline to participate in meetings and receive visits during the study period according to school regulations. This will enable them to settle down and study steadily, so as not to be distracted by social activities and affect systematic learning. Only in this way can we effectively train labor models and combat heroes to become the backbone of national advanced construction.

    培养产业工人和革命干部
    为高级建设人才的方法和道路
    胡锡奎
      一、新时期和新任务
    由于我们的国家是以工人阶级为领导、工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家，工人阶级是国家的领导阶级，因此，培养工农干部使之成为工人阶级自己的有文化与知识的建设干部，乃是新中国高等教育严重的政治任务。过去中国数十年来的高等教育，是为帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义服务的，因而它是脱离劳动人民的，劳动人民是根本不能走进高等学校的大门的。新中国的高等教育首先是要为工农服务的。正如斯大林同志在“新的环境和新的经济建设任务”中所指出的：“我们并不是需要随便一种工业指挥人材和工程技术人材。我们所需要的是能了解我国工人阶级底政策，能领会这个政策，并决意诚恳把它实现起来的那种人材。而这是什么意思呢？这就是说，我国已经走入这样一个发展阶段，此时工人阶级应当造就它自己的生产技术知识界，即能维护它这个统治阶级在生产中的利益的生产技术知识界。”“苏维埃政权注意到这点，所以极力吸收工人阶级分子到国民经济各部门高级学校去学习。你们知道，现在我国高级学校里学习的有几十万工农青年。从前在资本主义制度下，高级学校是少爷公子独占的场所，而现时在苏维埃制度下，工农青年却是高级学校里的统治力量了。毫无疑义的，我们在最近将来就会能从我们各高级学校里获得成千数的新的技师和工程师，我国工业的新的指挥员。”由此可见，新中国高等教育所应遵循的道路——培养工农知识分子为高级建设人才（包括工业指挥或管理人才与技术人才在内，二者不能偏废）的道路，是苏联社会主义建设已经走过的胜利的正确的道路。当然，我们所接受的文化遗产落后，在这一前进的道路上可能要遇到不少的曲折和困难，必须稳步地有计划地前进，但同时也不允许在这条道路上徘徊、犹豫，裹足不前。
    中国人民大学自一九五○年成立之日起，就根据中央指示，以培养工农干部为中心，除吸收思想进步的青年知识分子参加学习外，并大量地吸收产业工人和革命干部入学。几年来我校的学生成分都是产业工人与革命干部，约占总人数的百分之七十左右，其中还有一批劳动模范和战斗英雄，他们的学习成绩一般是良好的，进步是较快的。
    三年来中国人民大学本科及专修科学生共毕业四千五百八十七人，其中今年经济计划、统计、工厂管理（从今年起改为工业经济系）、财政信用借贷、贸易、合作六系学生四百四十三人毕业，产业工人占百分之十二，革命干部占百分之六十，知识青年占百分之二十八。这批学生不仅成分及政治质量好，而且经过了长期的正规教育与严格的毕业考试，学有专长，初步地掌握了马克思列宁主义与苏联先进科学的武器及三十多年以来社会主义建设的经验；因此，不仅基本上实现了“工农分子知识化”的口号，而且一般地已具有国家所需要的建设人才的科学水平。这是我国高等教育史上的新事件，这件事情已引起各有关部门的重视。毕业学生大部分是由中央人事部根据需要与“学以致用”的原则分配到各业务部门及厂矿企业进行工作；同时，一部分学习较好的毕业生，留在本校作正规的研究生
  （即比较高级的研究生）。在这批研究生中如工业经济系的机械班、冶金班、采煤班与纺织班，除个别青年知识分子外，皆为铁路镟工，金属机械厂钳工，采煤或纺织工人，其他财经各系的正规研究生，产业工人与革命干部也是不少的。这一切证明了培养工农知识分子为高级建设人才，不仅为国家建设所必需，而且也是可能的。但要贯彻执行这一方针和任务，必须一方面要与轻视工农学习的观点进行斗争，切实地解决他们在学习上的困难，并在生活上给以应有的保证；另方面也要反对只是由于主观上为了工人学习而过分降低入学标准的倾向，否则也会造成废品和走弯路。
    二、存在着的主要困难和
        克服困难的有利条件
    过去三年来中国人民大学招收了大批工人与干部直接入本科学习，一般都具有相当于初中的文化水平（今年则由于部队转业的干部与预科及工农速成中学毕业的同学占了较大的比重，同学入学时的文化水平有一定的提高），同时还由于他们的语文与数理化的知识参差不齐，高低不一，就成为这些同学一个共同的也是最基本的缺点。正因为存在着这种缺点，这就必然给高等学校教学工作带来若干实际的困难；但同时也存在着克服这种困难的有利条件。这就是他们具有一定的政治觉悟程度，有学习的责任感，他们认为这是党与国家交给自己的光荣的任务，保持着经常的饱满的学习情绪与积极性，同时还具有一定的革命斗争经验与生产知识，理解力较强。对这两方面都必须有足够的估计，才不致产生要求过高或悲观失望的情绪，我们的教学工作就是要充分地发挥其有利条件去战胜困难。在行政领导方面与教师们要认真研究他们学习的特点，加强对他们学习的领导和帮助，这就是：（1）领导上给他们支持和帮助，主要地是在教学计划上适当地增加数学、物理、化学、语文等文化基础课程的比重，从各方面加以照顾，解决他们学习上的困难，并进行严格的教育，鼓励他们前进。（2）教师进行耐心而有效的帮助，并不断创造适合于新情况的教学方法，尤其是教师特殊的积极的辅导，把宝贵的科学知识热情地交给学生，充分地表现了人民教师的特点，成为学生们克服困难最可依靠的力量。（3）初入学时由于同学之间的阶级友爱与劳动互助，知识多的帮助知识少的，老同学帮助新同学，先进的帮助落后的，继承了老解放区学习上的互相支援的光荣传统。经过了相当的时期，他们有了一定的基础，就逐渐引导他们养成独立钻研的习惯与自学的能力，把学习提高一步。这也是克服困难的一种助力。（4）号召与组织学生积极参加体育健康卫生运动，是克服困难完成学习计划的一个有力的保证。过去也有不顾身体健康，不顾学校制度的规定，或不积极参加体育健康卫生运动，单纯地片面地搞学习扣死书的人；结果，身体搞坏了，学习也搞不好。反之，凡注意身体锻炼，积极参加体育卫生运动的人，对于提高学习，克服困难，就产生
  一种实际的力量。例如工业经济系二年级机械一班的学生韩振东，是唐山铁路机器厂的工人。他来校学习，积极地参加“北京市高等学校一九五二年体育锻炼标准”的体育锻炼，获得优等奖。正是由于他的身体锻炼得好，平时学习成绩不但没有落后，而且经常都是保持着优，这就是“身体好，学习好，工作好”一个有力的证明。由于工人与干部的优点以及领导上不断地帮助他们克服学习中的困难，特别是初期的文化基础上的困难，使培养工农知识分子成为高级建设人才的可能性，随着理论与专业学习的逐渐深入与提高，通过两次生产实习与毕业考试，逐渐变成了现实。但必须指出这还只是打下初步的科学基础，绝不能有任何的骄傲自满。我们应当经常地警惕：“学习的敌人是自己的满足”，无论在任何机关企业或学校工作与学习岗位上，都要虚心努力，加强学习，深入钻研业务，在不断提高的基础上继续前进。
      三、方法和步骤
    为了切实贯彻高等教育向工农开门的方针，与更有效地培养工农知识分子，中国人民大学采取了如下的方法和步骤：
      （1）根据一九五○年中央成立中国人民大学的指示，招生标准，凡属产业工人、革命干部具有相当初中的文化水平（思想进步的青年知识分子须具有高中以上的文化水平），均可招收。这在目前中国的具体情况下，是适合于产业工人与革命干部入学要求的；如果要把这类学生的招收标准提高到高中的水平，势必仍然要把他们推之于校门之外。招收他们入学确实是有不少困难和麻烦的，但经验已经证明，困难是可以克服的，麻烦是任何革命工作所难以避免的，拒绝他们入大学本科则是没有理由的；所以我们仍坚持贯彻中央这一方针，除不降低我们的招生的文化条件外，并须保证身体健康，思想进步，年龄在三十岁以下。
    为了保证学生的质量和来源，我们是从两方面解决的，即一方面直接招收本科学生（专修科是由各有关业务部门提供轮训在职科长以上的干部），另一方面则从附设的预科和工农速成中学不断地扩大后备军。预科招收学生入学程度低于大学而高于工农速成中学，在工农速成中学学制不能变动情况下，预科带有过渡的性质。今后应在现有的基础上继续扩大这种后备力量，才能更好地保证工人、干部学生入学的数量和质量。
      （2）除了教学计划要照顾到学生程度不齐而有所安排外，在教学的内容和方法上，也不能完全采取一个进度或一种方法，因为目前我们实际上存在两种不同程度的学生。高中毕业的思想进步的青年知识分子，文化水平较高，政治水平低，比例较小，工人与革命干部政治水平高，文化水平低，比例较大，势必要采取不同的进度和方法才能解决问题。主要的是文化基础课程，时间短，要求高，但学生程度高低不齐；因此在这些课程的内容上除采取不同的进度进行教学外，并适当地加以减缩，编制一套结合专业进行讲授文化基础课程的教材讲义，程度较高的学生也可以按文化课系统进行学习
  （例如高等数学）。在教学方法上可按专业需要采取系统的单元教学法，内容少而精，由具体到抽象，由浅入深，要善于使用工农的言语与生活的实例进行解释，多用实物图表教学，普遍讲授，重点突出，要少讲，多练习，采用循环记忆法，在讲到新单元时，尽量插穿旧单元中的问题，多举熟例，不宜太快，要熟练，要巩固，以达到逐步提高的目的。
    （3）工人与干部学生缺少正规学习的习惯，其中不少的人有“单打一”的学习经验，习惯于漫谈讨论，对正规学习的制度与组织，有一定的思想顾虑与抵触，因此，首先必须安定他们的思想情绪，提高学习的信心，并按照课程表，各科教学进度，实习作业次数，学生本身对课程接受的难易，帮助他们制订每周学习计划，使他们趁记忆犹新时把功课复习一遍，这时养成学习习惯是很重要的一个环节。有了学习计划，就使他们能保证各科学习效果同时并进，做到心中有数，有条不紊，树立不断提高学习的信心。然后根据工人与干部学生在学习上的困难，由各教研室考虑组织个别的与集体的各种形式的辅导，引导他们深入钻研，提高学习效果。
      四、几点体会
    （1）三年来中国人民大学的教学实践证明了：中央关于培养工农干部成为国家高级建设人才的方针是完全正确的。由于工农干部具有一定的政治觉悟、斗争经验和生产知识，经过相当时期的正规教育之后，使其感性知识提高到理性知识，理论与实践相结合，就可能成为国家高级建设的骨干，为祖国的经济建设发挥更大的效率。他们不仅一般的能够成为高级的建设骨干，同时也能够培养成为科学工作者。今年中国人民大学毕业的工人与干部学生受到了各方面的欢迎。许多人已作了厂长、矿长或任部局与企业单位计划管理等职能科长、处长以上的工作，也有担任干部理论教育与科学工作的，这就是有力证明这种可能性的最雄辩的事实。因此，各业务部门、厂矿企业为了国家建设事业长远的利益，选送一批优秀的工人与干部入高等学校学习，是一件具有重大意义的事情。
      （2）工人和干部入大学的道路是多方面的，它既可以经过速成中学或预科的学习，也可以经过厂矿企业训练班、技术班的学习，然后进入大学；也可以经过厂矿与各业务部门选送优秀的工人与干部直接进入大学。因此工人与干部进入大学的道路，不一定都非经过工农速成中学阶段不可；当然，为了保证大学生后备力量的生长，工农速成中学必须继续扩大招生，同时对工农干部入学，在文化条件上也不宜机械地过分地强调一律非高中毕业程度不可。中国人民大学三年来的教育经验告诉我们：凡是工农干部相当于初中毕业程度者，就有入本科深造的可能。虽然在入学时，文化基础课程在学习的起点可能低一点，但由于他们积极努力学习的结果，最后仍能达到了提高的目的；而且他们培养出来的质量一般的并不比高中毕业升入大学的知识青年差。相反的，不少工农干部的学习成绩，还超过了青年知识分子，而且也是比较巩固的。
      （3）要保证工人和干部学习好，除了在一般教学上要采取有效的措施外，还要注意他们的日常思想教育，使他们更主动地保持经常的饱满的学习情绪。经常地关心他们的身体健康与生活状况，在可能条件下要适当地照顾到与解决他们生活方面的困难；但对其学习的要求则必须严格，特别是对劳动模范和战斗英雄的教育必须抓紧，尽量减免对外应酬与社会活动。凡属兼职（在校外）的同学，根据学校规定，在学习期内一般谢绝参加会议与接见访问。使其能安下心来，踏踏实实地学习下去，不致因社会活动而分散精力，影响系统地学习。只有如此，才能把劳动模范和战斗英雄有效地培养成为国家高级建设的骨干。
