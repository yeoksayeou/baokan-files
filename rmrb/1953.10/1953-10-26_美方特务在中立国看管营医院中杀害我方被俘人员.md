Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong Dispatch: Volunteer POWs Wang Xianzhang and Wang Xiang, who returned on the 23rd, both confirmed that at least four North Korean and Chinese POWs who requested repatriation had been murdered by U.S. special agents in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's custodial camp hospital. Wang Xianzhang himself was nearly buried alive by special agents.

When Wang Xianzhang and Wang Xiang were in the internal medicine ward of Camp No. 44 in the neutral nations custodial camp hospital, they personally witnessed a Volunteer POW with the surname Zhang, who lived in the same tent, being beaten to death with sticks by special agents. This POW surnamed Zhang had aroused the suspicion of the special agents because he usually did not speak. On September 29th, the special agents rolled up his sleeves to check and found that he had no tattoos, so they began to interrogate him. He only replied that his surname was Zhang, but did not answer his name or prisoner number. The special agent Deng Hongxun then ordered that he not be given food, intending to starve him to death. On October 1st, due to the disturbance created by the special agents, Indian troops entered the camp to maintain order. After the Indian soldiers withdrew, the special agents Deng Hongxun, Hu Kechang, and others immediately called two people to beat his head and chest fiercely with wooden sticks, hitting him more than twenty times. Finally, they used two wooden sticks from the marching bed to clamp his neck and strangled him to death. After the special agents killed him, they immediately reported to the Americans in the hospital, saying that Indian soldiers had killed the prisoner of war. The next morning, an Indian officer, an Indian in plain clothes, and a U.S. Army lieutenant colonel came to investigate. The special agents had already discussed it, locked all the prisoners of war in tents, and only allowed the so-called "prisoner of war representative," the special agent Hu Kechang, to pretend to be sick, lying on a stretcher and carried out of the barbed wire to "testify." Hu Kechang announced after "testifying": "We won this lawsuit over human life, and the Indians signed and admitted it!"

After that, Wang Xianzhang never saw the Indians come to the hospital for further investigation. Wang Xianzhang said: "I personally witnessed the whole process of this incident. Before I came back, I had told the Indians the names of the murderers. I can testify anywhere!"

Not many days after this murder, Wang Xianzhang heard Zhang Guangjin, who was sent by the special agents in the mental illness ward to deliver the message, say to Deng Hongxun: "Three Koreans climbed the barbed wire and tried to escape, but were caught and beaten to death. Two were beaten to death last night, and one was beaten to death the night before yesterday. One was not dead when he was buried." He also told Deng Hongxun where the bodies were buried. On October 11th, Wang Xianzhang happened to go to that place and saw two new mounds of earth.

    美方特务在中立国看管营医院中杀害我方被俘人员
    据新华社开城电：二十三日归来的志愿军被俘人员王宪章和王祥一致证实了至少已有四名要求遣返的朝中被俘人员在中立国看管营医院中被美方特务分子所杀害，王宪章本人也几乎被特务活埋。
    王宪章和王祥住在中立国看管营医院中的第四十四号营场内科病房时，他们亲眼看见同帐篷住的一个姓张的志愿军被俘人员被特务分子用棍子夹死。这个姓张的被俘人员因为平时不说话，早已引起特务分子的怀疑，九月二十九日特务把他的袖子捋起来看，发现他没有刺字，就开始审问他，他只回答说姓张，没有回答他的名字和俘虏编号，特务分子就更加恶狠狠地问他：“你要到哪里去？”张说：“回中国！”特务分子邓鸿勋就命令不许给他吃饭，打算把他活活饿死。十月一日那天，由于特务制造骚乱，印度部队曾进入营场维持秩序。印度士兵退出后，特务邓鸿勋、胡克昌等当即叫来两个人，用木棍猛打他的头部和胸部，打了二十多棍。最后又用两根行军床上的木棍夹住脖子，把他活活夹死了。特务打死人以后，马上报告医院里的美国人，说是印度兵打死了战俘。第二天上午，一个印度军官和一个穿便衣的印度人员以及一个美军中校同来调查。特务们早已商量好，把战俘们都关在帐篷里，只让所谓“战俘代表”、特务分子胡克昌装病躺在担架上抬出铁丝网去“作证”。胡克昌“作证”回来后宣布说：“这场人命官司我们打赢了，印度人签字承认了！”
    此后，王宪章再也没有看到印度人到医院里来作进一步的调查。王宪章说：“我亲眼看见了这件事的全部经过，我回来以前已经把凶手的名字告诉了印度人，无论到什么地方，我都可以作证！”
    在这次杀人事件发生以后没有几天，王宪章又听到被精神病室里的特务分子派来传递消息的张光金对邓鸿勋说：“有三个朝鲜人爬铁丝网想逃走，被抓回来打死了，昨天晚上打死两个，前天晚上打死一个，有一个被埋起来的时候还没断气呢。”他还告诉邓鸿勋尸体埋在什么地方。十月十一日，王宪章偶然到了那个地方，果然看见有两处新土。
