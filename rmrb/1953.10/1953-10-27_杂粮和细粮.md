    Coarse Grains and Refined Grains
    Researcher, Central Institute of Hygiene
    Yang Enfu
    Since liberation, people's lives have become increasingly prosperous. The most significant manifestation of this is that the consumption of refined grains (rice and flour) has increased in large cities, while the consumption of coarse grains (millet, sorghum rice, mixed grain flour, etc.) has decreased. Newspapers frequently carry news about schools and factories improving their meals, and the only way to improve them is to change coarse grains to refined grains. In our numerous dietary surveys, we have also found that the canteens of some schools and construction sites use only rice and white flour as their staple food. According to our research, this approach has not improved nutritional status; instead, the number of people with nutritional deficiencies has increased.
    According to our investigation, many units or individuals spend about 80 percent of their food expenses on staple foods and very little on non-staple foods. Diets are not only lacking in meat, but also in vegetables and oil. Therefore, deficiencies in Vitamin A and Vitamin C are quite common. However, if the staple food is slightly adjusted, using some coarse grains instead of refined grains, the money saved can be used to increase non-staple foods, bringing the diet closer to suitable nutritional conditions. Improving nutritional status is entirely achievable.
    Coarse grains account for more than 40 percent of China's food production, and some regions rely entirely on coarse grains as their staple food. However, most people doubt whether coarse grains have sufficient nutritional value and whether they are easy to digest. They are unaware that some nutritionists in our country have done a lot of research in this area, and their results prove that these concerns are unnecessary.
    We can extract some material on grain analysis from the food composition table compiled by the Department of Nutrition of the Central Institute of Hygiene to answer the first question, namely, whether coarse grains have sufficient nutritional value.
    Nutritional Composition per Jin of Refined and Coarse Grains (Attached Table)
   The figures in the table show that the amount of heat energy provided by various grains does not differ much. As for the protein content of grains, although there are some differences in nutritional value due to different types and varieties, such as the poorer nutritional value of corn protein, research has shown that the nutritional value of the protein contained in other grains, including flour, is similar to each other.
    Regarding how to solve the problem of the nutritional value of corn protein, the Chinese people have gained good experience in their lives. For example, residents living in North China are accustomed to mixing corn flour with millet flour and soybean flour to make millet noodles or mixed grain flour. Experiments have shown that the nutritional value of the protein contained in such mixed grains is better than that of all single foods. Mothers who eat mixed grain flour also produce more milk of better quality than mothers who mainly eat rice.
    Recently, we have done some more experiments and proved that adding 30 percent corn flour or millet flour to "August 1st Flour" does not affect fermentation for making steamed buns. In addition, using the above-mentioned mixed grains as feed, no adverse effects on the growth rate of animals were found. Therefore, adding coarse grains does not reduce the nutritional value of "August 1st Flour." What is even more worth mentioning is that in our continued experiments, we added some soy flour as a non-staple food, and the experimental results proved that flour mixed with millet can make animals grow faster than "August 1st Flour." This shows that eating some coarse grains while eating refined grains is good for your health.
    The biggest nutritional problem faced by the Chinese people is the lack of various vitamins in their diet, especially Vitamin B1, Vitamin B2, and Vitamin A. The table above shows that the Vitamin B1 content of all coarse grains is higher than that of rice, only sorghum rice is inferior to "August 1st Flour," but the sorghum rice referred to in the table has been processed through eight or even nine milling procedures. If it is only milled five or six times, then the Vitamin B1 content of sorghum rice is not much different from that of "August 1st Flour." It is worth mentioning that millet, among all coarse grains, contains far more Vitamin B1 than other grains. As for the Vitamin B2 content, almost all coarse grains are higher than refined grains.
    Due to insufficient vegetable cultivation or a lack of vegetables due to seasonal reasons, Vitamin A deficiency is quite common in our country. However, it must be pointed out that refined grains contain very little Vitamin A, or almost none, but corn and millet have considerable content.
    Therefore, from the perspective of preventing various vitamin deficiencies, coarse grains are much better than refined grains.
    Although sweet potatoes do not belong to the grain category, they are generally considered coarse grains. Sweet potatoes are not only widely planted and have a high yield per unit area, but they are also an important food source for providing heat energy. According to estimates, three jin of sweet potatoes can抵(match or substitute) one jin of grain.
    Some farmers in certain areas of China even use sweet potatoes as their staple food. Although we do not recommend that everyone use sweet potatoes as their staple food, it is beneficial to eat some sweet potatoes regularly. Because in many areas of China, people only use Chinese cabbage as their only non-staple food in winter, and Chinese cabbage contains very little Vitamin A, and its Vitamin C content is greatly reduced after prolonged storage. To prevent the occurrence of vitamin deficiencies, using sweet potatoes is the best way. The Vitamin A content of sweet potatoes varies greatly depending on the variety. According to our analysis, the lowest content is only 1,500 international units per jin, and the highest reaches 45,000 units. Unfortunately, the Victory No. 1 variety that we are currently promoting has the lowest Vitamin A content. Red-hearted sweet potatoes that can be bought on the market can have a Vitamin A content of more than 10,000 units per jin. The North China Agricultural Science Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has cooperated with the Central Institute of Hygiene to improve sweet potato varieties, starting from increasing the Vitamin A content, and has achieved great success. The improved variety can reach 45,000 units of Vitamin A per jin. If each person eats three taels a day, it can ensure that Vitamin A is not deficient. In addition, sweet potatoes also contain a lot of Vitamin C, especially because they are easy to store and can replace fresh vegetables in winter. Therefore, we believe that the improved variety of the North China Agricultural Research Institute should be vigorously promoted.
    To answer the question of whether coarse grains are easy to digest, we must consider the various factors that affect digestion. The first is the structure of the food itself, the second is the pre-meal processing, and the third is the capacity of the human digestive organs.
    Let's talk about the structure of the food itself first. Any grain contains a certain amount of crude fiber, which has the effect of stimulating intestinal peristalsis. If the food contains too much crude fiber, intestinal peristalsis is over-stimulated, causing the food to pass through the digestive organs in a relatively short period of time, so that the digestive juices do not have enough time to decompose the food, resulting in indigestion. However, if the crude fiber content is too low, it will affect poor intestinal peristalsis and easily cause constipation. Therefore, an appropriate amount (5 to 10 grams per person per day) of crude fiber in the food is necessary. The table above shows that the crude fiber content of some coarse grains such as sorghum and millet is not higher than that of refined grains, and the crude fiber content of other coarse grains, except for barley and oats, is not enough to affect digestion. Sometimes, people excrete more feces and feel bloated in their abdomen after eating corn flour, simply because the outer skin of the corn and soybeans used has not been removed. Even with barley rice and oats, if they are properly processed or the daily intake is not too large, it will not affect digestion.
    Secondly, let's talk about pre-meal processing. According to general habits, rice, sorghum, and millet are used to make rice. After rice is cooked, the rice grains form many cracks. Therefore, cooked rice grains have a larger area in contact with digestive juices during the digestion process, and digestion is faster. As for sorghum and millet, they cannot form as many cracks as rice after being cooked. Because the contact area with digestive juices is not large, digestion is slower. Therefore, the pre-meal processing of sorghum rice and millet should be further studied. However, if rice is ground into flour and made into rice flour noodles, its advantageous conditions will completely disappear. Experiments have shown that the digestion rate of rice flour after being boiled in water is no different from that of sorghum flour and millet flour treated in the same way. Experiments have shown that bread baked with sorghum flour is easier to digest than sorghum rice.
    Thirdly, it is the capacity of the human digestive organs. In this regard, attention should first be paid to the degree to which food is chewed. The main component of food is starch, and saliva in the mouth is the main digestive juice for digesting starch. Therefore, you must chew more when eating. This not only grinds the food, but also increases the area of contact between the food and the digestive juices and prolongs the digestion time. Many people eat by swallowing quickly, so after eating sorghum rice or millet rice, they inevitably excrete whole grains of rice in their feces, and think that coarse grains are not easy to digest. With such eating habits, not only coarse grains are not easy to digest, but even if refined grains are eaten, they will not be completely digested.
    The degree of food digestion is also greatly related to the amount of food eaten each time. Some people only eat two meals a day, or eat very little breakfast, and most of the food is concentrated in lunch and dinner. Eating too much food at one time overburdens the digestive organs and cannot digest all the food at once, resulting in indigestion.
    In addition, the function of human digestive organs is also greatly related to eating habits. Pavlov proved that animals that consume large amounts of protein have a stronger ability to digest protein. Pediatricians all know that the saliva of an infant who has never eaten grain has no ability to digest starch, and only after eating grain for a few days can it gradually have this digestive ability. Recently, some people have proven that the saliva of ethnic groups who mainly eat meat has a very low ability to digest starch. These facts show that people who are not used to eating coarse grains do not always feel that they are not easy to digest after eating them. After getting used to them, they can use these grains very well. It is best for a person to be accustomed to all kinds of food, so that people's organs can adapt to various different foods. However, at the beginning, they should eat small amounts, and then gradually increase them. After becoming accustomed to them, they will not feel that they are not easy to digest.
    Another digestion-related issue is the question of "delicious or not delicious." The taste of food also affects digestion. When we were doing surveys at construction sites, some comrades who had never eaten coarse grains ate steamed buns made from "August 1st Flour" and white corn flour for many days in a row. Apart from feeling a little sweet, they did not feel that they were not delicious. Recently, some colleagues visited some public canteens and saw that these canteens used coarse grains to make various kinds of food, which were very popular among the diners. Therefore, we believe that when using coarse grains, we can use our brains more and find suitable cooking methods to solve the taste problem.
    The only disadvantage of flour mixed with coarse grains and refined grains is that it is not easy to store. Therefore, we cannot hope that flour mills will sell mixed flour at present. However, those who use it, especially public canteens in institutions, troops, factories, or schools, can mix it themselves. The procedure is simple and there are no difficulties.
    Based on the above analysis, we believe that the nutritional value and digestibility of coarse grains are not necessarily inferior to those of refined grains. In some respects, they are even better than refined grains. Moreover, adding coarse grains to the diet can increase the money saved on food expenses for non-staple foods. This approach is extremely beneficial to improving people's nutritional status.

    杂粮和细粮
    中央卫生研究院研究员
    杨恩孚
    解放以来，人民的生活日渐宽裕，最显著的表现是：在大城市里，细粮（大米和面粉）的消耗量增加，杂粮（小米，高粱米，杂合面等）的消耗量减少。报纸上经常可以看到关于学校和工厂改善伙食的消息，其改善办法只不过将杂粮改成细粮。在我们多次膳食调查中，也发现若干学校和工地的食堂完全以大米和白面作为主食。根据我们的研究，这种办法并没有把营养状况改好，营养缺乏病患者反而增多。
    根据我们的调查，许多单位或个人的伙食费，百分之八十左右都用在主食上面，用在副食上面的很少。在膳食中，不仅缺少肉类，亦且缺乏菜蔬和油。因此，甲种维生素和丙种维生素缺乏现象相当普遍。但是如果将主食调配稍加改变，用一部分杂粮代替细粮，节省下来的钱就可用以增加副食，使伙食可以接近适于营养的条件，营养情况是完全有把握改善的。
    杂粮占我国食粮生产量的百分之四十以上，某些地区甚至完全以杂粮作为主食。但是杂粮是否有足够的营养价值，杂粮是否容易消化，大多数人都是抱着怀疑态度的。他们不知道我国曾经有一些营养学工作者在这方面做了许多研究，而且他们所得的结果证明这些顾虑是不必要的。
    我们可以从中央卫生研究院营养学系编写的食物成分表中摘录关于谷类分析的一部分材料来解答第一个问题，即杂粮是否有足够的营养价值的问题。
    每斤细粮和杂粮的营养成分（附图表） 
   表中数字说明，各种食粮所能供给的热量是没有多大差别的。至于粮食中所含蛋白质虽然由于种类不同和品种不同在营养价值上有若干差别，如玉米的蛋白质营养价值较差等，但是根据过去所做的研究，可知其他的粮食，包括面粉在内，所含蛋白质的营养价值是彼此相近的。
    关于如何解决玉米蛋白质的营养价值的问题，我国人民在生活经验中已经得到了很好的办法。例如，生活在华北一带的居民，就很习惯于用玉米粉和糜子面及黄豆粉混合在一起做成小米面或者杂合面。试验证明，这样混合的粮食所含蛋白质的营养价值比一切单独的食粮都要好。食用杂合面的母亲也比以大米为主食的母亲出奶多，并且质量好。
    最近我们又做了些试验，证明“八一粉”里掺入百分之三十的玉米粉或小米粉并不影响发酵做馒头。此外，又曾以如上配合的粮食作为饲料，对于动物的生长率亦未发现任何不良影响。因此，掺入杂粮，并不降低“八一粉”的营养价值。更值得提出的是，在我们继续进行实验中，曾加用了一些大豆粉作副食，而实验结果证明了掺有小米的面粉比
    “八一粉”还能够使动物生长得更快。由此可见，在吃细粮的时候也吃些杂粮，对身体的健康是有好处的。
    我国人民在营养上存在的最大的问题，就是膳食中各种维生素缺乏的问题，尤其是一号乙种维生素、二号乙种维生素和甲种维生素缺乏的问题。上表指出，所有杂粮的一号乙种维生素含量都比大米高，只有高粱米不如“八一粉”，但表中所指的高粱米是经过磨八道甚至磨九道的手续处理的，如果只磨五道或者六道，那高粱米所含的一号乙种维生素和“八一粉”的含量并没有多大差别。值得特别提出的是，小米在一切杂粮中，所含一号乙种维生素远远超过其他的粮食。至于二号乙种维生素的含量，则几乎所有的杂粮都比细粮高。
    由于蔬菜的栽培不够，或者由于季节的关系缺少蔬菜，甲种维生素缺乏症在我国是相当普遍的。但是必须指出，细粮所含甲种维生素是很少的，或者是几乎等于没有的，但是玉米和小米却有相当的含量。
    因此，从预防各种维生素缺乏症的角度来看，杂粮也要比细粮好得多。
    甜薯虽然不属于谷类，但一般也把它算作杂粮。甜薯不仅是种植面积很广，单位面积产量很高，也是一种供给热量的重要食物。根据推算，每三斤甜薯可以抵一斤粮食。
    甚至我国有些地区的农民，经常用甜薯作为主食。我们虽然不建议每个人都以甜薯为主食，但是经常食用一些甜薯是有益处的。因为在我国很多地区，冬季仅以大白菜作为唯一的副食，而大白菜所含甲种维生素很低，并且储藏过久，其所含丙种维生素也大大减少。为了预防维生素缺乏症的产生，利用甜薯是一个最好的办法。甜薯的甲种维生素含量，因为品种不同，差别很大。根据我们的分析，含量最低的每斤只有一千五百国际单位，最高的达到四万五千单位。可惜我们目前所推广的胜利一百号品种就是甲种维生素含量最低的。市上可以买到的红心甜薯，每斤甲种维生素的含量可以到一万单位以上。中央人民政府农业部华北农业科学研究所曾与中央卫生研究院合作，从提高甲种维生素的含量出发，改良甜薯的品种，得到很大的成功。经过改良的品种，所含甲种维生素每斤可以达到四万五千单位。如果每人每天吃三两，就可以保证甲种维生素不至缺乏。此外，甜薯所含丙种维生素也多，尤其是因为它便于储藏，在冬季可代替新鲜蔬菜。因此，我们认为华北农业研究所的改良种是应该大力加以推广的。
    为了答复关于杂粮是否容易消化的问题，我们必须从影响消化的各种因素来考虑。第一是食物本身的结构，第二是食前的处理，第三是人体消化器官的能力。
    我们先谈食物的本身的结构。任何粮食都含有一定量的粗纤维，粗纤维有刺激肠蠕动的作用。如果食物所含粗纤维过多，肠蠕动受了过分刺激，使食物在比较短的时间内即行通过消化器官，以致消化液不能有充分的时间发挥分解食物的作用，因而造成消化不良。但是如果粗纤维含量过少，又将影响肠蠕动不良，容易引起便秘。因此，食物中有适量（每天每人五至十克）的粗纤维是必需的。上表指出，某些杂粮如高粱和小米的粗纤维含量不比细粮高，其他杂粮的粗纤维含量除大麦和莜麦外，并不至于对消化有什么影响。有的时候，人吃了玉米面以后，粪便排泄多，腹内感到胀气，这只是因为所用玉米和黄豆没有将外皮去掉的缘故。即以大麦米和莜麦而论，如果经过适宜的加工，或者每日所食分量不多，也不至于影响消化。
    其次，我们谈一谈食前的处理。按照一般习惯，大米、高粱、小米是用来做饭的。大米煮熟后，米粒形成许多裂口，因此煮熟以后的米粒在消化过程中，由于和消化液接触的面积比较大，消化也就比较快。至于高粱和小米，则煮熟后不能像大米一样形成许多裂口，由于和消化液接触面积不大，消化得比较慢些。因此高粱米和小米的食前处理还应该进一步加以研究。但是如果将大米磨成粉、制成米粉面条，则它的有利条件就完全不存在了。试验证明，大米粉经用水煮后，其消化速度和经过同样处理的高粱粉和小米粉并没有什么差别。试验证明，用高粱粉烤成面包，是比高粱米饭消化得更好的。
    第三是人体消化器官的能力。在这方面，首先应该注意食物被咀嚼的程度。食粮所含主要成分是淀粉，口腔内的唾液是消化淀粉的主要消化液。因此，在进食时必须多加咀嚼。这不但可以使食物磨碎，并且可以增加食物与消化液接触的面积和延长消化的时间。有许多人吃东西，是采取狼吞虎咽的办法的，因此在吃了高粱米或小米饭以后，就不免在粪便里排泄出整粒的饭，而认为杂粮不容易消化了。这样的吃法，不但杂粮不容易消化，即令吃的是细粮，也是一样不会消化完全的。
    食物的消化程度和每次的食量也有很大的关系。有的人每天只吃两餐，或者是早餐吃得很少，大部分的食物集中在午餐和晚餐。一次吃下过多的食物，使消化器官负担过重，一时不能将所有食物都消化掉，以致造成消化不良。
    此外，人体消化器官的功能和饮食习惯也有很大的关系。巴甫洛夫曾经证明，食用大量蛋白质的动物，其消化蛋白质的能力比较强。小儿科医师都晓得，一个从未吃过粮食的婴儿，他的唾液就没有消化淀粉的能力，只是在吃了粮食几天以后，才可以渐渐地有这种消化能力了。近来有人证明，以肉为主食的民族，唾液消化淀粉能力很低。这些事实说明了没有习惯吃杂粮的人，不是永远吃了以后就感觉不易消化，习惯了以后一样可以很好地利用这些粮食。一个人最好是能够习惯于各种各样的食物，这样就可以使人的器官适应各种不同的食物。不过在开始的时候应当少量食用，以后可以逐渐增加，成了习惯以后，就不会感觉不易消化了。
    另外一个和消化有关的问题，就是“好吃不好吃”的问题。食物的口味不好，也会影响消化。我们在工地作调查的时候，有些同志一向没有吃过杂粮，接连着吃了许多日子“八一粉”和白玉米粉所制的馒头，除了觉得有些甜味之外，并没有不好吃的感觉。最近有些同事参观了一些公共食堂，看见在这些食堂里利用杂粮制成各种不同花样的食物，这些食物很受食用者的欢迎。因此，我们认为在使用杂粮的时候，多动些脑筋，找出适宜的烹饪方法，就可以解决口味的问题。
    用杂粮和细粮掺合的面粉只有一个缺点，就是不容易储存。因此，目前不能希望制粉厂将混合好的面粉出售。但是用的人，尤其是机关、部队、工厂或学校里的公共食堂，是可以自己去掺合的，手续简单，并没有什么困难。
    根据以上的分析，我们认为杂粮的营养价值和消化率并不见得不如细粮，有些方面甚至比细粮还要好。并且在膳食中掺用了杂粮，就可以将节省下来的伙食费增加在副食上。这种办法对于改善人民的营养情况是极其有利的。
