Comrades:
	Today, the people of Korea and China solemnly celebrate the third anniversary of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers fighting against our common enemy, the American imperialist armed aggressors.
	The immortal feats established by the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front will, together with the great achievements of the Korean People's Army, shine forever in our history.
	Through this conference, I extend my heartfelt thanks and highest respect to the great Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the heroic commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who have sincerely assisted the Korean people in the Korean War and in the post-war reconstruction of Korea, as well as in the cause of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
	Comrades: When the Korean people were in their most difficult period, the Chinese people, in order to assist the Korean people and to defend the security of their own country and the peace of the Far East and the world, sent the volunteer army composed of their own excellent sons and daughters to the Korean front three years ago today, turning the Korean war situation to our advantage and achieving the great victory we have today. This great victory has made a huge contribution not only to safeguarding the security of the people of Korea and China, but also to the cause of defending peace in the Far East and the world.
	The courageous spirit and noble moral qualities displayed by the Chinese People's Volunteers in the course of the Korean War have become a vivid example of proletarian internationalism.
	The Chinese People's Volunteers love every mountain and every blade of grass in Korea as they love the land and grass of their own motherland. They lived and died together with the Korean People's Army, overcame all difficulties, repelled all enemy attacks, forced the enemy to retreat to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, the starting point from which they had begun their aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and forced the continually defeated enemy to finally sign the Korean Armistice Agreement.
	Dear Comrades! The Chinese People's Volunteers have demonstrated unparalleled and noble moral qualities not only in combat but also in helping the people in the rear areas of Korea. They used the intervals between battles to help Korean farmers cultivate the land and build houses; actively helped repair the reservoirs destroyed by the enemy; and even saved their own rations to provide large amounts of relief to war refugees.
	The self-sacrificing spirit of martyr Luo Shengjiao, who saved the life of a Korean boy at the cost of his own, is a living example of true internationalism. There are many such touching examples in the Chinese People's Volunteers.
	The Korean people feel infinite pride and honor in having such comrades-in-arms. Therefore, the Korean people infinitely respect and love the Chinese People's Volunteers and do everything in their power to support them. The deeds of Korean farmer Park Jae-geun, who sacrificed his own life to rescue wounded Chinese People's Volunteers, are an example of how the Korean people treat the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers.
	In the face of the strong and resilient struggle of the Korean and Chinese people, united firmly under the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism and internationalism, the enemy, from the beginning of the Korean War to the armistice, suffered, according to the U.S. Department of Defense's own admission, more than 1.47 million killed, wounded, and captured. More than 12,200 enemy aircraft were shot down or damaged, and more than 257 enemy ships were sunk or destroyed. In this way, the United States suffered a disastrous defeat unprecedented in its history.
	However, the American imperialists do not want to learn the lessons they should from this serious military failure and the disastrous failure in political morality. On the contrary, they have not given up their conspiracy to launch wars and are even frantically plotting for war.
	Under these circumstances, the Korean people are continuing to struggle with high vigilance, and on the basis of the Korean Armistice, are making further efforts for the peaceful reunification of Korea and for the further easing of international tensions around the world, especially in the East. At the same time, the Korean people firmly believe that, with the help of the great Soviet Union, China, and the people of all brotherly people's democratic countries, they will do everything in their power to successfully complete the post-war economic reconstruction, which will become the basis for the peaceful reunification of their own country.
	The Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and their beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, are waging a heroic struggle for the restoration of the post-war people's economy with the firm confidence of victory, just as they did in the war against the American imperialist armed aggressors.
	Glory to the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea!
	Long live the Chinese People's Volunteers!
	Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity of the Korean and Chinese people!
	Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!
	Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung, the beloved leader of the Korean people!
	Long live Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union!
	Long live the victory of the world's peace and democracy camp!

### 徐哲的讲话

专栏：

    徐哲的讲话亲爱的同志们：
    今天，朝中两国人民很庄严地庆祝英勇的中国人民志愿军对我们共同的敌人美帝国主义武装侵略者作战的三周年。
    中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线所树立的不朽功勋，将与朝鲜人民军的伟勋一起，在我国历史上永远光辉。
    通过本大会，我向在朝鲜战争中和在朝鲜人民战后恢复建设以及为朝鲜问题和平解决事业中，诚心诚意地援助朝鲜人民的伟大的中国人民、毛泽东主席，和英勇的中国人民志愿军指战员们，致以衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    同志们：当朝鲜人民最艰难的时期，中国人民为了援助朝鲜人民，为了保卫自己祖国的安全和远东及世界的和平，在三年前的今天，把由自己优秀的儿女所组成的志愿军部队，派遣到朝鲜前线，使朝鲜战局转变为于我们有利，并争取了像今天这样的伟大胜利。这一伟大的胜利，不但在捍卫朝中两国人民的安全方面，并且在保卫远东和世界和平的事业方面，都作了巨大的贡献。
    中国人民志愿军，在朝鲜战争过程中所发挥的勇敢精神和崇高的道德品质，已成为无产阶级国际主义的生动的典范。
    中国人民志愿军，把朝鲜的每座山，每棵草木，都爱如自己祖国的土地和草木。他们和朝鲜人民军同生共死，克服一切困难，击退敌人的一切攻击，迫使敌人败退到它们曾开始侵犯朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的出发地三八线附近，迫使继续遭到失败的敌人终于不得不在朝鲜停战协定上签了字。
    亲爱的同志们！中国人民志愿军不仅是在战斗中，而且在帮助朝鲜后方人民的事业中，也表现了无比高尚的道德品质。他们利用战斗间隙，帮助朝鲜农民耕种土地和修建住宅；积极帮助抢修了遭到敌人破坏的贮水池；更节省出自己的口粮，大量接济了战灾难民。
    不惜自己的生命，救活了朝鲜少年的罗盛教烈士的自我牺牲精神，是真正国际主义的活生生的榜样。这样动人的事例，在中国人民志愿军里是很多的。
    朝鲜人民因为有这样的战友，感到无限骄傲和光荣。所以，朝鲜人民无限尊敬和爱戴中国人民志愿军，并尽一切的力量，来支援他们。献出自己的生命，抢救了中国人民志愿军伤员的朝鲜农民朴在根的事迹，是朝鲜人民对待英勇的中国人民志愿军的一个范例。
    在这种马克思列宁主义的战无不胜的国际主义旗帜下，巩固地团结起来的朝中两国人民的坚强而有韧性的斗争面前，从朝鲜战争开始到停战，敌人被我军杀、伤、俘掳的，据美国国防部自己承认，共达一百四十七万多名。敌机共被击落或击伤一万二千二百多架，敌人舰艇共被击沉或击毁二百五十七艘之多。这样，使美国遭到在它历史上没曾有过的惨重失败。
    可是，美帝国主义者并不想从这种军事上的严重失败中以及在政治道义上的惨重失败中接受应有的教训，反之，它还不放弃发动战争的阴谋，更在疯狂策划战争。
    在这种情况下，朝鲜人民正以高度的警惕，继续斗争，在朝鲜停战的基础上，进一步为朝鲜的和平统一，为进一步缓和全世界的、首先是东方的国际紧张局势而努力。同时，朝鲜人民坚信，在伟大的苏联、中国和各兄弟人民民主国家人民的帮助下，竭尽一切的力量，一定会胜利完成将成为和平统一自己祖国的基础的战后人民经济的恢复事业。
    朝鲜人民，在朝鲜劳动党和自己敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的领导下，像在反对美帝国主义武装侵略者的战争中一样，以必胜的坚强信心，为战后人民经济的恢复，正在展开着英雄的斗争。
    为抗美援朝而牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    朝中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊团结万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅万岁！
    苏联部长会议主席马林科夫同志万岁！
    世界和平民主阵营胜利万岁！
