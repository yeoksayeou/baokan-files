    Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, Grain Purchase Work Experience
    Zhou Xiuqing, Secretary of the Yanggao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    This year, in the autumn grain purchase work in Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, the Party committee corrected the past tendencies of "only eating grain, not managing grain" and "only managing politics, not asking about economics," and focused most of its attention on the grain purchase work. The purchase speed increased by two times compared to last year. At the same time, because a reasonable price policy was implemented in the grain purchase work, and necessary political work and economic work were carried out, the worker-peasant alliance was further consolidated, the masses were further united, and the relationship between the Party and the masses was closer. The masses generally have a very good response to this autumn's grain purchase work. Some farmers even composed ballads praising the grain purchase work: "Born in the era of Chairman Mao, there is no worry about selling grain, no worry about buying goods, the procedures are simple, and the attitude is kind."
    The reason why Yanggao County's grain purchase work can achieve considerable results is mainly because it has grasped several central links such as vigorously carrying out political propaganda and doing a good job in supplying materials.
    Vigorously carry out political and economic work
    Before and after the start of the autumn grain purchase work, the county party committee and the district party committees educated cadres through various meetings to recognize the economic and political significance of the grain purchase work. At the same time, the county party committee, at the joint meeting of grain depot directors and primary cooperative directors, pointed out to the grain purchase cadres: the grain purchase work should achieve two goals: first, economically, to overfulfill the task of purchasing grain and supplying materials; second, politically, to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance through the grain purchase work. The county party committee criticized the past one-sided views of cadres in grain purchase of "burying their heads in grain purchase, not asking about politics" and "only caring about tasks, not caring about policies," and explained the consistency of tasks and policies, and the consistency of the mass viewpoint and the national viewpoint. This made the cadres themselves clearly recognize the significance of the grain purchase work, and became more consciously aware of the importance of political propaganda work in grain purchase in their thinking. More than 130 cadres from party committees and government departments throughout the county went deep into the countryside, leading the masses in autumn plowing on the one hand, and publicizing the significance of the state's purchase of grain on the other hand. The mobile purchase teams of the cooperative system brought goods to the countryside to purchase grain on the one hand, and actively publicized the significance of grain purchase work on the other hand. Their slogans are:
    "Go wherever we go, publicize wherever we go," "Purchase grain while publicizing."
    Our political propaganda work in grain purchase focused on publicizing the importance of the state's control of grain and the state's price policy, and publicizing that the farmers' selling grain to the state is a patriotic action to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and support national construction, and it is also the glorious responsibility of all grain farmers. At the same time, we explained to the farmers the three relationships between the patriotic action of selling grain to the state and the interests of the farmers, namely: the relationship between national interests and individual interests, the relationship between industrial interests and agricultural interests, and the relationship between current interests and long-term interests. Through these propagandas, the farmers further enhanced their patriotic awareness and further strengthened the idea of the worker-peasant alliance. In our grain purchase propaganda, we also combined it with the propaganda of increasing grain production, saving grain, and the agricultural tax policy.
    Political propaganda work has a great effect. For example, some farmers in Bao Village initially had the idea of waiting for high prices and hoarding, and were unwilling to sell grain; after political propaganda was carried out, the farmers sold grain to the state one after another. In two days, this village completed a month's grain purchase task.
    The cooperative societies at all levels in Yanggao County generally attached importance to the supply of materials in grain purchase. The primary cooperative societies generally strengthened the supply of materials in coordination with the grain purchase work; the cooperative system also organized 19 mobile teams, bringing goods to the countryside and going deep into remote villages, supplying on the one hand and purchasing on the other hand. The joint cooperatives of Aoshi Village and Youzhai Village adopted the methods of "bringing goods to the countryside, carrying grain back to the cooperative," "purchasing grain with one hand, selling goods with the other," and "exchanging goods for grain," and did a good job in supplying materials, which encouraged the farmers' enthusiasm for selling grain. According to incomplete statistics from Aoshi Village and Bao Village, 14 wealthy farmers originally did not plan to sell grain in the autumn, but later saw that other farmers had bought satisfactory goods, so they actively sold grain to buy goods. Many farmers support the method of purchasing with goods in the countryside, they said: the method of bringing goods to the countryside is really good, it saves us both labor and trouble. As a result, the amount of grain purchased by these two cooperatives in September reached more than one-fourth of the total amount purchased in the county in September.
    In the past, the primary cooperative societies in Yanggao County had the phenomenon of "three not receiving" in the grain purchase work, that is: not receiving those who come early, not receiving those who come late, and not receiving when settling accounts; some grain purchase cadres had a bad attitude towards the grain-selling farmers, which caused dissatisfaction among the farmers. This autumn, we have basically overcome these shortcomings. The primary cooperative societies generally achieved "receiving as soon as they come," and the grain purchase cadres generally achieved "good attitude, good reception, and good unity with the masses." The purchasing stations also generally prepared tea to entertain the grain-selling farmers. In order to save the farmers' time, the grain purchase cadres actively tried to improve work efficiency and achieved "three fasts" - fast weighing, fast issuing receipts, and fast payment. In the past, the purchasing station purchased 10,000 jin of grain every day, and some farmers had to wait for two or three hours to receive the payment; now they can purchase 20,000 to 30,000 jin of grain every day, and the farmers can still "come and go as they please" without any crowding. Therefore, the farmers are willing to sell grain to the state purchasing station. Many farmers said: the style and attitude of the cadres at the purchasing station have changed for the better. In the past, when we came to sell grain, we could not even get cold water to drink, but now we can drink boiled water, and the payment is also very fast. We will go back and tell everyone to sell grain at the state purchasing station!
    The Party committee strengthens leadership, and all departments cooperate closely
    This autumn, the Party committees at all levels in Yanggao County generally attached importance to the grain purchase work. First of all, at the beginning of the autumn grain purchase, the county party committee convened a meeting to specifically study the grain purchase work, and let the responsible cadres of the relevant departments attend. Then, a joint meeting of district party committee secretaries was convened to uniformly deploy the grain purchase work; after the district party committee secretaries went back, they convened a joint meeting of township branch secretaries and township chiefs to convey the work deployed by the county party committee; then the township branch secretaries conveyed the significance of grain purchase and the price policy to the branches. Recently, the county party committee issued a call to all party members, requiring party members to take the lead in leading the masses to sell grain and support national economic construction. At the same time, the county party committee personally participated in and helped to hold a joint meeting of grain depot directors and primary cooperative directors. Secondly, Comrade Yu Jicai, Minister of the Organization Department of the County Party Committee, and others went deep into the relevant departments and rural areas to inspect the grain purchase work and help solve problems. Recently, the Party committee and the main cadres of the grain company and the cooperative society jointly conducted an in-depth inspection of the grain purchase work, and after discovering problems such as the lack of grain depots in the ninth district and the difficulty in transportation in the second district, they were promptly resolved. In addition, the Party committee also paid attention to mobilizing relevant departments to promptly commend good people and good deeds in grain purchase and promptly exchange experiences. Recently, the director of the County Cooperative Union commended the two primary cooperatives of Aoshi Village and Youzhai Village with good grain purchase results at the joint meeting of the primary cooperative societies and grain depot directors, which boosted the enthusiasm of the cadres of these two cooperatives, and also promoted the active action of the primary cooperative societies with relatively backward grain purchase work.
    Facts have proved that the Party committee attaches importance to and strengthens leadership is the basic key to doing a good job in grain purchase work.
    In addition, in this autumn's grain purchase work in Yanggao County, the policy of "purchasing a large amount of grain, comprehensive purchase, buying both coarse and fine grains, and receiving both good and inferior grains" was also implemented. The past ideas of cadres such as "only focusing on purchasing in the market, neglecting purchasing in the countryside," "only focusing on sitting at the counter to purchase, neglecting mobile purchases," "only focusing on purchasing in the plains, neglecting purchasing on the mountains" and "valuing fine grains, neglecting coarse grains," "valuing good grains, neglecting inferior grains" were criticized; the price policies such as "grading and pricing" and "superior grain and superior price" were publicized and implemented, and the regional price differences were appropriately adjusted and reduced; the work of recovering loans was carried out in coordination with the grain purchase, and these practices promoted the smooth development of the grain purchase work.
    Existing problems
    In the previous stage, there were still some shortcomings in the autumn grain purchase work in Yanggao County.
    First of all, in some areas, the propaganda work was not universal and in-depth enough, and bad elements took the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, which aroused the idea of reluctance to sell among some farmers. At the same time, in some areas, there were speculative private merchants using methods such as raising prices and purchasing small quantities to disrupt the grain market, which also fueled the idea of reluctance to sell among some farmers. We have decided to further carry out propaganda work in light of the actual situation, and strengthen rural control work and strengthen market management.
    Secondly, some commodities are in short supply in some areas, and there are out-of-stock phenomena; some areas have financial disconnections. These have affected the purchase work. Now the County Cooperative Union has sent cadres and mobilized the primary cooperative societies to investigate the quantity and specifications of goods needed by the masses, and formulate purchase and sales plans and replenish materials according to the actual situation. At the same time, the three departments of the grain company, the cooperative society, and the bank have strengthened their contacts with each other and between the upper and lower levels to promptly understand the use of funds at the lower levels and promptly allocate funds.
    In addition, some areas have insufficient grain depots, or lack of transportation capacity, and too few cadres. The leaders have not timely discovered and solved these problems; individual primary cooperative societies still have the phenomenon of suppressing prices, weights, and grades, which have affected the smooth development of the grain purchase work to a certain extent. At present, we have tried to solve these problems.

    山西省阳高县购粮工作经验
    中共阳高县县委书记  周秀清
    今年山西省阳高县秋季购粮工作，由于党委纠正了过去“只吃粮，不管粮”和“只管政治，不问经济”的偏向，把大部注意力集中在购粮工作上，收购速度比去年提高了两倍。同时由于在购粮工作中贯彻了合理的价格政策，进行了必要的政治工作和经济工作，也就进一步巩固了工农联盟，进一步团结了群众，密切了党和群众的关系。群众对今秋购粮工作普遍反映很好。有些农民还编了歌谣称赞购粮工作：“生在毛主席时代，有粮不愁卖，要货不愁买，手续又简便，态度又和蔼。”
    阳高县购粮工作所以能作出相当成绩，主要是因为抓住了大力开展政治宣传和做好物资供应工作等几个中心环节。
    大力作好政治和经济工作
    县委和各区区委在秋季购粮工作开始前后，曾通过各种会议教育干部认识了购粮工作的经济意义和政治意义。同时县委在粮库主任和基层合作社主任联席会议上，向购粮干部指出：购粮工作中要达到两个目的：第一、在经济上要超额完成收购粮食和供应物资的任务；第二、在政治上要通过购粮工作进一步巩固工农联盟。县委在会上批判了过去干部在购粮中“埋头购粮，不问政治”、“只顾任务，不顾政策”的片面观点，说明了任务和政策的一致性，群众观点和国家观点的一致性。这样就使干部首先自己明确认识了购粮工作的意义，并且在思想上更加自觉地重视了购粮中的政治宣传工作。全县党委、政府部门有一百三十余名干部深入农村，一面领导群众秋耕，一面宣传国家收购粮食的意义。合作社系统的流动收购小组，一面带货下乡收购粮食，一面积极宣传购粮工作的意义。他们的口号是：
    “走到那里，宣传到那里”、“边购粮，边宣传。”
    我们在购粮中的政治宣传工作，着重宣传国家掌握粮食的重要性和国家的价格政策，宣传农民把粮食卖给国家是巩固工农联盟、支援国家建设的爱国行动，也是全体粮农的光荣责任。同时向农民说明把粮食卖给国家这一爱国行动和农民利益的三种关系，即：国家利益和个人利益的关系、工业利益和农业利益的关系、当前利益和长久利益的关系。通过这些宣传，使农民进一步提高了爱国主义的觉悟，进一步加强了工农联盟的思想。我们在购粮宣传中，还结合进行了增产粮食、节约粮食以及农业税政策的宣传。
    政治宣传工作，效果很大。如堡村部分农民开始有等待高价等惜售思想，不愿出卖粮食；经过进行政治宣传，农民们纷纷把粮食卖给国家。两天工夫，这个村就完成了一个月的购粮任务。
    阳高县各级合作社对购粮中的物资供应工作，一般是重视的。各基层合作社一般都配合购粮工作，加强了物资供应；合作社系统还组织了十九个流动小组，带货下乡，深入偏僻乡村，一面供应，一面收购。鳌石村和友寨两个村联社采取“带货下乡，背粮回社”、“一手购粮，一手卖货”和“以货换粮”的办法，作好了物资供应工作，鼓舞了农民的卖粮情绪。据鳌石村和堡村不完全的统计，有十四户富裕农户原来不打算在秋季卖粮，后来看到别的农民买了如意的货物，便积极卖粮买货。许多农民都拥护带货下乡收购的办法，他们说：带货下乡的办法真好，使咱们又省工，又省事。结果这两个社在九月份收购粮食的数量，达全县九月份总收购量的四分之一以上。
    过去阳高县基层合作社在购粮工作中有“三不收”的现象，即：早来不收，晚来不收，结账时不收；有些购粮干部对售粮农民的态度不好，引起农民不满。今秋我们已基本上克服了这些缺点。各基层合作社普遍作到了“随来随收”，购粮干部普遍作到了“态度好、招待好、团结群众好”。收购站还普遍预备茶水，招待售粮农民。为了节省农民的时间，购粮干部积极设法提高工作效率，作到“三快”——快过磅、快开条、快付款。过去收购站每天收购一万斤粮，有些农民要等两、三个钟头才领到款；现在每天收两、三万斤粮，农民还能“随来随走”，一点也不拥挤。因此农民都愿意到国家收购站卖粮。许多农民说：收购站干部的作风、态度变好了。过去来卖粮，有时连冷水也喝不上，现在能喝到开水，付款也很快。咱回去告诉大家，叫大家都到国家收购站来卖粮！
    党委加强领导，各部门密切配合
    今秋阳高县各级党委普遍重视了购粮工作。首先，在秋季购粮开始时，县委即召开会议具体研究了购粮工作，并让有关部门的负责干部列席。随后即召开区委书记联席会议，统一布置购粮工作；区委书记回去后，召开乡支部书记、乡长联席会议，传达县委布置的工作；然后由乡支部书记向支部传达了购粮的意义和价格政策等。最近县委又向全体党员发出号召，要求党员带头领导群众出卖粮食，支援国家经济建设。同时，县委又亲自参加并帮助开好了粮库主任和基层合作社主任联席会议。其次，县委组织部部长于吉财同志等还深入有关部门和农村检查购粮工作，帮助解决问题。最近党委和粮食公司、合作社主要干部共同对购粮工作深入进行了检查，发现九区粮库缺乏、二区运输困难等问题后，及时予以解决。另外，党委还注意发动有关部门及时表扬购粮中的好人好事，及时交流经验。最近县合作社联合社主任在基层合作社和粮库主任联席会议上表扬了购粮成绩好的鳌石村和友寨两个基层社，鼓舞了这两个社的干部的工作积极性，同时也推动购粮工作比较落后的基层社积极行动起来。
    由于党委广泛宣传了购粮工作的重要意义，许多党委、政府部门的干部克服了过去认为“购粮工作与我无关”的思想，积极参加了购粮宣传等工作。国营粮食部门和合作社的关系，今年也有很大改进。去年国营粮食部门和合作社都存在一些本位主义的思想，互相配合不够，甚至互不信任，影响了购粮工作。今年县委批判了这两个部门过去存在的本位主义和分散主义的错误，加强了有关干部的整体观念，贯彻统一领导的原则，改进了这两个部门的关系。这两个部门在县委领导下，统一了思想，统一了计划，统一了样品，统一了价格，并订出联系制度；在购粮范围方面，也进行了分工。国营粮食部门明确认识了依靠合作社的重要性，大大发挥了合作社在购粮中的作用。
    事实证明：党委重视，加强领导，是作好购粮工作的基本关键。
    另外，阳高县今秋购粮工作中，还贯彻了“大量购粮，全面收购，粗细兼买，好次都收”的方针，批判了过去干部“只顾在市场收购，忽视下乡收购”、“只顾坐柜收购，忽视巡回收购”、“只顾在平原收购，忽视上山收购”和“重细粮，轻粗粮”、“重好粮，轻次粮”的思想；宣传和贯彻了“分等论价”、“优粮优价”等价格政策，适当调整和缩小了地区差价；配合购粮进行了收回贷款的工作，这些作法，都促进了购粮工作的顺利开展。
    存在的问题
    阳高县秋季购粮工作，在前一阶段还存在一些缺点。
    首先是有的地区宣传工作不够普遍和深入，坏分子趁机造谣破坏，引起了部分农民的惜售思想。同时，有的地区有投机私商用抬价少量收购等办法，扰乱粮食市场，也助长了部分农民的惜售思想。我们已决定结合实际情况，进一步开展宣传工作，并加强农村管制工作，加强市场管理。
    其次，有的地区某些商品供应不足，有脱销现象；有的地区资金脱节。这都影响了收购工作。现在县合作社联合社已派出干部并发动基层社调查群众需要货物的数量、规格等，根据实际情况制订购销计划，充实物资。同时粮食公司、合作社、银行三个部门之间和上下级之间都加强了联系，及时了解下边资金使用情况，及时调拨资金。
    另外，有的地区粮库不足，或运输力缺乏，干部太少，领导方面对这些问题没有及时发现和解决；个别基层合作社还有压价、压秤、压级的现象，这都在一定程度上影响了购粮工作的顺利开展。目前，这些问题，我们已经设法加以解决。
