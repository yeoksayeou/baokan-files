To meet the increasing demand for animal power in agricultural production and transportation, various regions have vigorously carried out livestock breeding work in the first half of this year, and have achieved remarkable results.

Northeast, North China, Northwest, Inner Mongolia and other major regions and Shandong, Henan and other provinces have mated a total of more than 657,000 head of female livestock this year. Public breeding stations have mated more than 73,000 head of privately owned livestock. Henan Province alone has mated more than 175,000 head, of which the conception rate of mating female donkeys and horses reached 40%. If all survive, more than 23,700 mules could be bred next year, which will be able to supply part of the animal power for agricultural production and transportation in the province.

This year, the People's Government continued to implement the policies of not struggling against or dividing property, not drawing class lines, protecting and developing animal husbandry, and benefiting both labor and capital in pastoral areas; after correcting the deviations of forcibly borrowing livestock for free use without the consent of livestock owners, and premature collectivization of livestock in agricultural production cooperatives in agricultural areas, the enthusiasm of farmers and herdsmen for raising livestock has greatly increased, and breeding work in agricultural areas has also developed rapidly. After understanding the policy, some herdsmen in Xinjiang dispelled their concerns, dug out gold and silver buried underground for many years to buy livestock, and requested the supply of fine breeding stock. The number of female livestock mated this year in agricultural areas such as Jilin, Liaoxi, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces has exceeded previous years. The number of female horses mated in Liaoxi alone has more than doubled compared with last year. The brisk sales of livestock products, the increase in livestock prices, and the lifting of restrictions on the export of draught animals have all stimulated the enthusiasm of livestock farmers for breeding livestock. In Ningxia before liberation, every 100 jin of camel hair could only be exchanged for 33 jin of wheat or 28 chi of Yanta cloth, but in 1952 it could be exchanged for 1,786 jin of wheat or 710 chi of Yanta cloth. Zhang Yong, a farmer in Zhangguzhuang, Tongxian County, Hebei Province, raised a female donkey, which gave birth to a mule foal in 1951, and sold it last year for the equivalent of 25 shi of corn. The number of female livestock mated for mule foals in the county this year has increased by four and a half times compared with last year. After Jilin Province in Northeast China implemented the free trading of draught animals last December, the price of two- and three-year-old foals increased by an average of 30% in February this year, which not only provided adjustments and supplements to areas lacking draught animals, but also encouraged farmers to breed livestock.

Veterinary organizations and public breeding stations in various regions have become the main force in supporting private breeding households and organizing the masses to carry out livestock breeding, and have played a great role in increasing and protecting livestock. This year, major infectious diseases of more than 8 million head of livestock have been prevented and controlled in various regions. The epidemic diseases can generally be controlled in time and eradicated in a short period of time, which greatly reduces the threat of epidemic diseases and increases the confidence of farmers and herdsmen in raising and breeding livestock. Public breeding stations actively support private breeding livestock households, and organize the masses to select breeds locally, which has initially solved the difficulty of insufficient breeding livestock. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently more than 17,000 head of private breeding livestock (horses, donkeys, cattle) across the country, and they are carrying out breeding within the scope divided with public breeding stations. Most of the public breeding stations have mastered good breeds from home and abroad, and actively improved artificial insemination technology, which has been welcomed by the masses. In addition, the People's Government also provided a large number of loans to help the masses purchase breeding livestock. According to statistics from Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Qinghai alone, the loans for breeding livestock reached more than 580 million yuan. Various mutual aid groups were also organized in pastoral areas to build sheds and pens, and to hunt wolves and cut grass. These have played a role in promoting the breeding and protection of livestock.

There are also serious shortcomings in livestock breeding. In many places, serious blindness has been shown in the development of breeding livestock and the establishment of breeding stations. People relied solely on enthusiasm, without considering the actual needs and possibilities. Liaodong Province originally planned to establish 74 artificial insemination stations for breeding mules (mules born from female donkeys), but as a result, only 18 were established due to insufficient personnel and equipment; and because the technical level was very low, the conception rate of the breeding station in Fuxian County only reached 9.3%. In solving the problem of insufficient breeding livestock, some areas did not start from the current foundation of the masses breeding livestock, so although the number of breeding livestock increased, the owners of female livestock were still unwilling to breed, resulting in losses for breeding livestock households. The work style of coercion and command is also very serious. In some places, breeding livestock households are forced to organize large joint ventures, with breeding livestock priced as shares. As a result, because it is not democratic and voluntary, the work of breeding livestock households is passive. Some areas force the masses not to use horses to breed mules. Guangling County in Shanxi Province stipulates that if donkeys are used to mate with horses, a fine of 200,000 yuan will be imposed, forcing some households raising female horses to go to Hebei to breed. In addition, some state-owned farms and public breeding stations have neither played the exemplary role of socialist enterprises, nor maintained good relations with the masses, and even stood in opposition to the masses, giving the masses a very bad impression. Especially in terms of development, there is a blind pursuit of quantity and scale, lacking a clear management direction. Some farms build houses first, and then determine the work tasks. The management of farms lacks economic accounting. Generally, the costs are high and waste is great. Some farms require a cost of 30 to 40 million yuan to raise a two-year-old foal. In addition, the labor organization of some farms and breeding stations is extremely unreasonable, with each person managing an average of just over one horse. The lax management system and the phenomenon of no one being responsible have also caused huge waste of breeding livestock and feed. All these shortcomings are inseparable from the fact that the higher-level leading organs do not understand the actual situation and forcibly assign tasks in a bureaucratic manner. This has been exposed in this year's anti-bureaucracy struggle, and all regions must thoroughly check and correct it when convening meetings or conducting centralized training for cadres this winter.

    适应农业生产和运输事业发展的需要
    各地大力配种繁殖牲畜
    为适应农业生产和运输事业日益增加的对于畜力的要求，今年上半年各地大力进行了牲畜配种繁殖工作，已经取得了显著的成绩。
    东北、华北、西北、内蒙等大区及山东、河南等省今年共交配母畜六十五万七千多头，公营配种站给民畜交配的有七万三千多头。只是河南省就配种十七万五千多头，其中用母驴和马交配的，受胎率达百分之四十，如能全部成活，明年就可繁殖驴骡二万三千七百多头，将能供给该省农业生产和运输业一部分畜力。
    人民政府今年在牧区继续贯彻了不斗不分，不划阶级，保护发展畜牧业和劳资两利的政策；在农业区纠正了不得畜主同意就强借白用，和农业生产合作社中牲畜过早入伙归公的偏向以后，农牧民养畜情绪高涨，农业区配种工作也迅速开展起来。新疆有些牧主了解政策以后，解除了顾虑，挖出多年埋藏在地下的金银去购买牲畜，并要求供给优良种畜。农业区吉林、辽西、河南、河北、山东等省今年母畜的交配数字都超过往年，只辽西的母马交配数就超过去年一倍以上。畜产品的畅销，牲蓄价格的提高，限制耕畜出境规定的解除，都刺激了养畜户繁殖牲畜的情绪。宁夏在解放以前，每百斤驼毛只能换三十三斤小麦或二十八尺雁塔布，到一九五二年就可换一千七百八十六斤小麦或七百一十尺雁塔布了。河北省通县张谷庄张镛养了一头母驴，在一九五一年生了骡驹，去年就以相当二十五石玉米的价钱卖了出去。该县今年配骡驹的母畜比去年增加了四倍半。东北吉林省去年十二月实行了耕畜自由买卖后，今年二月间，二、三岁马驹价格平均提高了百分之三十，不但使缺耕畜的地区得到了调剂补充，而且鼓励了农民繁殖牲畜。
    各地兽医组织、公营配种站，已经成为扶植民营配种户，组织群众进行牲畜配种的主要力量，对增畜保畜工作起了很大的作用。今年各地防治了八百多万头牲畜的主要传染病，对流行的疫病一般能做到及时控制，短期扑灭，大大减轻了疫病的威胁，提高了农牧民饲养和繁殖牲畜的信心。公营配种站积极扶植民营种畜户，并组织群众就地选种，初步解决了种畜不足的困难。据目前不完全统计，全国已有民营种畜（马、驴、牛）一万七千多头，和公营配种站划分范围进行配种。公营配种站大部掌握了国内外良种，积极改进人工授精技术，受到了群众的欢迎。此外，人民政府还大量贷款，帮助群众购买种畜，只是内蒙、宁夏、青海统计，种畜贷款就达五亿八千多万元。牧区并组织各种互助组，修搭棚圈，打狼打草。这些，对繁殖和保护牲畜都起了推动作用。
    牲畜配种繁殖工作中，还有严重的缺点。许多地方，在发展种畜、建立配种站等工作中，都表现了严重的盲目性，单凭热情，而不考虑实际的需要和可能性。辽东省原计划建立配驴骡（母驴生的骡）的人工授精站七十四处，结果因人员器材的不足，只成立了十八处；又因技术水平很低，复县配种站受胎率只达到百分之九点三。在解决种畜不足的问题上，没有从目前群众繁殖牲畜的基础出发，因此，有些地区种畜虽然增加了，母畜主仍然不愿配种，致使种畜户赔本。强迫命令作风也很严重，有的地方硬性组织种畜户大联营，种畜作价入股，结果，因为不是民主自愿，种畜户工作都表现消极。有的地区强迫群众不许用马生骡，山西广灵县规定，如用驴配马，要罚洋二十万元，逼得一些养母马户到河北去配种。此外，有些国营牧场和公营配种站，既没有起到社会主义企业的示范作用，和群众的关系也搞得不好，甚至和群众对立，给群众以极不好的影响。特别是在发展方面，盲目贪多贪大，缺乏明确的经营方针，个别牧场先盖好房子，才确定工作任务。对牧场的经营缺乏经济核算，一般是成本高，浪费大，个别牧场养好一匹二岁大的马驹竟需要成本三、四千万元。另外，有的牧场和配种站劳动组织极不合理，每人平均只管大小马一匹多。管理制度不严和无人负责的现象，也造成种畜和饲料的巨大浪费。所有这些缺点，都是和上级领导机关不了解实际情况，硬性布置任务的官僚主义分不开的，这在今年反官僚主义斗争中已经揭发出来，各地还须在今冬召开会议或集训干部时彻底检查纠正。
