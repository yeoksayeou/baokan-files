    Seamless Steel Tube Plant Production Personnel Confidently Take Up Their Posts
    A production army mastering modern seamless steel tube rolling technology has confidently taken up their production posts.
    This production army has grown up alongside the newly built Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Seamless Steel Tube Plant. Among them are forty workers and technicians who studied advanced tube rolling technology in the Soviet Union, and they are the backbone of this production army; there are young peasants from the countryside and children of Anshan workers, who account for about 70 percent of the total number; there are veteran workers sent by brother factories and mines; and there are also veteran Anshan workers who came with their families from rural areas in Shandong and Hebei. They had been displaced to the countryside due to the severe damage suffered by Anshan during the late period of Japanese puppet rule and the Kuomintang rule. After the founding of New China, they were allocated land and settled down to farming in the countryside for many years. In addition, there are technicians assigned by the state. In this production army, nearly 20 percent of the personnel are young women, mostly girls from the countryside, now distributed across various production processes.
    The production personnel of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant began learning production technology as early as the end of last year and the beginning of this year. In their studies, they all demonstrated a tenacious will to overcome difficulties. Therefore, before entering the workshop, they had basically learned the operating methods of rolling seamless steel tubes and understood general technical theories. Technician Wang Jiazheng, a young student who graduated from Tangshan Institute of Technology last year, was assigned to work in Anshan in the autumn of that year. As a result of her hard work in the actual construction of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant over the past year, she has grown up together with the Seamless Steel Tube Plant. She has now been promoted to a formal technician and serves as the shift leader of the most important and complex tube rolling section of the entire plant. Tube rolling machine operator Zheng Xinming and heating worker Lan Zhenqi are both veteran workers with more than ten years of experience. When they started learning new technologies, they also encountered new difficulties. However, after humbly and diligently persisting in their studies, they finally successfully mastered modern production technology and became excellent workers. Feeder operator Li Jinzhi is a young girl from the countryside who had never seen a machine before and only knew a few characters from the quick literacy class. Therefore, when she first heard a bunch of unfamiliar technical terms, she became anxious. But later she thought: To master such a good machine, how can I not learn to "pick it up and put it down"? She worked hard day and night, and asked veteran workers about anything she didn't understand. Later, she finally caught up with the learning progress and became an excellent student. This production army is composed of these people with the precious qualities of loving new things and being unafraid of difficulties.
    As the various projects were successively accepted, this production army stepped onto their respective work posts in batches. The employees who took up their posts early demonstrated their outstanding ability to master the latest equipment technology during the load test run. On the first day of trial loading, the charging machine operator could only load two rows of tube billets in fourteen minutes. But after five or six days, they could load three rows of tube billets in five minutes, reaching a skilled level. The operators on the tube rolling machine and the straightening machine were also unable to coordinate their hands and eyes at the beginning of the operation. However, after one or two days of guidance from Soviet experts, they are now operating very skillfully. When the workers in the processing plant first operated the latest Soviet automatic lathes, they dared not work without Soviet experts and masters present. However, after a short period of time, 60 percent of the workers were able to work independently. The factory director wrote an article to celebrate the completion of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, titled: "We can build and we can produce." His bold words have now been vividly practiced by thousands of employees of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant in their creative labor.

### 无缝钢管厂生产人员满怀信心地走上岗位

    无缝钢管厂生产人员满怀信心地走上岗位
    一支掌握现代化轧制无缝钢管技术的生产大军，已满怀信心地走上生产岗位。
    这支生产大军，是和新建的鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂同时成长起来的。其中有曾经到苏联学习过先进的轧管技术的四十个工人和技术人员，他们是这支生产大军中的骨干；有来自农村的青年农民和鞍山工人的子弟，他们约占总人数百分之七十左右；有各兄弟厂矿派来的老工人；还有远从山东、河北各地农村携眷而来的原来鞍山的老工人，他们都是在日伪统治末期和国民党统治时期因鞍山遭到严重破坏而流离乡村，新中国成立后分得土地，在农村安家务农多年了的。此外，有国家统一分配来的技术人员。在这支生产大军里，还有为数将近百分之二十的人员是年轻的妇女，她们大都是来自农村的姑娘，现在分布在各个生产程序上。
    无缝钢管厂的生产人员，早在去年年底和今年年初就开始了生产技术的学习。在学习中，他们都表现了克服困难的顽强毅力，因而在没有进入车间之前，就基本上学会了轧制无缝钢管的操作方法，并懂得了一般的技术理论。技术员汪家铮是去年才从唐山工学院毕业的一个青年学生，就在这一年的秋天被国家分配到鞍山来工作。一年来，她在实际参加无缝钢管厂的建设中刻苦学习的结果，已和无缝钢管厂一起成长起来，现在她已被提升为正式技术员，并担任了全厂最重要、最复杂的轧管工段的值班长。轧管机运转手郑新明、加热工蓝振岐，都是具有十多年工龄的老工人，他们开始学习新的技术时，也碰到了新的困难，可是经过虚心努力地坚持学习，终于也胜利地掌握了现代化的生产技术而变成了优秀的工人。送料机女工李金芝，是一个来自农村的年轻姑娘，过去一部机器也没有见过，而且只在速成识字班里认识了不多的字。因此在开始学习时听到一堆陌生的名词术语，就急得发闷，可是后来她想：掌握这样好的机器，不学得“拿得起，放得下”怎么行呢？她就废寝忘食地苦学，有不明白的地方就问老工人，后来也终于赶上了学习进度，而且变成了优等学生。这支生产大军就是由这些具有着热爱新事物的宝贵品质和不怕困难的顽强人物所组成的。
    这支生产大军随着各项工程的陆续验收，分批地踏上了各自的工作岗位。早踏上工作岗位的职工们，在负荷试运转中，就显示了他们掌握最新设备技术的卓越能力。装料机运转手在试行装料的第一天，十四分钟内只能装两排管胚，可是在五、六天之后，他们就能在五分钟内装三排管胚，达到了熟练的程度了。轧管机、均整机上的运转手，在开始操作时，也都手眼不能配合，可是经过苏联专家一两天的指导，现在已操作得很熟练了。加工工厂的工人们，在刚操纵苏联最新式自动车床时，没有苏联专家和师傅在跟前，就不敢进行工作，但经过很短的时间，就有百分之六十的工人能独立进行工作了。厂长为庆祝无缝钢管厂竣工写了一篇文章，题目是：“我们能建设，也能生产。”他的这一豪语，现在已为无缝钢管厂千百个职工在创造性的劳动中生动地实践了。    （新华社）
