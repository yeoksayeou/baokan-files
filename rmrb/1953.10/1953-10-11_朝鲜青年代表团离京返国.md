Xinhua News Agency: The Korean Youth Delegation, which was invited to China to attend the National Day celebrations, left Beijing for home on the 8th. Among those who went to the station to see them off were Qu Tangliang, Secretary of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, and others. Correction: In the editorial of this newspaper on October 10, "Implement National Policies and Criticize Han Chauvinism," the second line of the third paragraph, which reads "established 47 ethnic autonomous regions at or above the county level...", should be changed to "by March 1953, a total of 47 ethnic autonomous regions at or above the county level had been established...".

    朝鲜青年代表团离京返国
    据新华社讯：应邀来我国参加国庆节观礼的朝鲜青年代表团已于八日离京返国。到车站欢送的有中国新民主主义青年团中央书记处书记区棠亮等多人。补正十月十日本报社论“贯彻民族政策，批判大汉族主义思想”第三段第二行中的“建立了四十七个相当于县级及县级以上的民族自治区……”，应改为“到一九五三年三月止共建立了四十七个相当于县级及县级以上的民族自治区……”。
