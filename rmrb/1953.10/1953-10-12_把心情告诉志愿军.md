Telling the Feelings to the Volunteer Army
Yi Haomei

Last June, when the early rice matured in Hequan Township, Liling County, Hunan Province, a letter arrived from the Korean front to the Zou Yelai mutual aid team. It was written by Zou Nanren, Zou Yelai’s son and a soldier in the Volunteer Army. The letter said: "I heard that your mutual aid team won the red flag, and I'm really happy. This time, I want to challenge you, with the condition: strive to earn merits and become a model. Are you willing?..."

It turned out that in the spring production last year, the Zou Yelai mutual aid team absorbed advanced experience, accumulated a lot of fertilizer, and controlled pests well. The rice harvest was abundant, and they also won a big red flag. In April, Zou Yelai wrote a letter to his son Nanren to tell him the news. The members of the mutual aid team thought: the Volunteer Army is in Korea to defend our good life, this time, Nanren challenged us, how can we not respond? So, they held four symposiums in a row, set out the conditions for responding to the challenge, and sent them to the Korean front.

As a result, everyone's production enthusiasm was even greater. Drought resistance, fertilizer accumulation, pest control, weeding... every job was done on time. The late rice grew even better than the early rice. In total, the average yield of early and late rice was 1,130 jin per mu, an increase of 30% compared to 1951!

After the autumn harvest, the Zou Yelai mutual aid team was rated as a provincial-level model mutual aid team, and Zou Yelai himself was also rated as a provincial-level special-class agricultural labor model. In December, the mutual aid team was also rated as a national model mutual aid team for high rice yield, and the team received a certificate and a bonus of one million yuan. Zou Yelai also received a medal.

This spring, one day, Zou Yelai was attending a meeting in the district, and Nanren's commendation for meritorious service also arrived there. The news immediately spread throughout the township and the district. The farmers in the township all went to his house to congratulate him, and the district also gave him a big flag with the words "One person earns merit, the whole family is honored."

The news was also sent to the Volunteer Army on the Korean front. The Zou Yelai mutual aid team challenged Nanren, and the mutual aid team guaranteed to use advanced farming techniques and guarantee a yield of 1,300 jin of rice per mu in 1953. Zou Yelai also proposed to Nanren: "You fight well, I farm well, and strive to see Chairman Mao together!" In his reply, Nanren excitedly accepted the challenge conditions.

The Zou Yelai mutual aid team cultivated more than a dozen mu of land on the banks of the Lujiang River. This year, the early rice seedlings had just been planted when the first major flood came. The seedlings were all submerged in water. When the flood was about to recede, Zou Yelai led everyone to wade into the water to wash away the mud and support the seedlings. However, the seedlings had just recovered when the second, third... a total of five major floods came one after another. The team members fought the floods time and time again. Not long after the floods were repelled, a drought followed. At this time, everyone drew water to fight the drought. Men and women, day and night, persisted for more than thirty days, and the paddy fields were never without water. The early rice was harvested abundantly. In addition, this year, in March, Zou Yelai gloriously joined the Communist Party of China, and his two sons at home also joined the Communist Youth League; in April, the second commendation for meritorious service from Nanren on the Korean front arrived, and everyone's excitement was indescribable!

In late September, Comrade Zou Yelai received a notice to participate in the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to慰问 (express sympathy and solicitude to) the soldiers in Korea. Before he left, he said: "This time, I must tell Nanren and the Volunteer Army comrades all the feelings of the people of our county!"

    把心情告诉志愿军
    易浩梅
    去年六月，湖南醴陵县河泉乡的早稻成熟的时候，一封书信从朝鲜前线寄到了邹业来互助组里。这是邹业来的儿子、志愿军战士邹南仁写来的。信里写道：“听说你们互助组里得了红旗，我心里真喜欢。这回呀，我要向你们挑战，条件是：争取立功，当模范。你们愿意吗？……”
    原来在去年春季生产中，邹业来互助组吸取了先进经验，积肥多，除虫好，稻子获得了丰收，还得了一面大红旗。四月，邹业来就把这个消息写信告诉他的儿子南仁。互助组组员们想：志愿军在朝鲜就是为了保卫咱们的好日子，这回，南仁向我们挑战，那还能不应？于是，他们一连开了四次座谈会，把应战条件订出来，寄到朝鲜前线去。
    这一来，大家的生产劲头就更足了。抗旱、积肥、除虫、除草……，每样活都没误了时候。晚稻比早稻长得更好。合计一下，早、晚稻平均每亩收了一千一百三十斤，比一九五一年增产了三成！
    秋收后，邹业来互助组被评为全省的甲等模范互助组，邹业来自己也被评为省的特等农业劳动模范。十二月间，互助组又被评为全国水稻丰产模范互助组，组内获得奖状一份，奖金一百万元。邹业来也得了一枚奖章。
    今年春天，有一天，邹业来正在区里开会，南仁的立功喜报也到了那里。消息立刻传遍了全乡、全区。乡里的农民都到他家里去贺喜，区里还送给他一面“一人立功，全家光荣”的大旗。
    消息又送给朝鲜前线的志愿军。邹业来互助组向南仁挑战，互助组保证使用先进耕作技术，保证一九五三年每亩收稻谷一千三百斤。邹业来还向南仁提出：“你打好仗，我种好地，争取一块去见毛主席！”南仁在回信中，兴奋地接受了挑战条件。
    邹业来互助组在渌江岸上种着十几亩土地。今年的早稻刚插上苗，第一次大水就来了。禾苗都淹在水里。当大水快退的时候，邹业来就带领大家，下水洗泥、扶苗。可是，禾苗才反省过来，第二次，第三次……一共五次大水连续袭来。组员们也一次又一次地和洪水作斗争。洪水被打退不久，旱灾又接着袭来。这时大家又车水抗旱。男的女的，白天黑夜，一连坚持了三十多天，稻田里始终没断过水。早稻获得了丰收。再加上今年三月间，邹业来光荣地加入了中国共产党，他在家里的两个儿子也加入了青年团；四月，朝鲜前线又送来了南仁第二次立功的喜报，大伙的高兴劲儿，真是没法形容！
    九月下旬，邹业来同志得到了通知，要参加中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团到朝鲜去。他临走前说：“这回呀，可要把咱全县人民的心情，都告诉南仁，告诉志愿军同志！”
