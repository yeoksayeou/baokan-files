Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 29th: Indian poet Chattopadhyaya, after visiting Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou and other cities in China, returned home via Hong Kong from Guangzhou on the morning of the 29th. Ouyang Shan, chairman of the Guangzhou Writers Association, and others were at the station to see him off.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 30th: Indian poet Chattopadhyaya expressed his sentiments before leaving Guangzhou, as follows: I believe that China is the guarantee of the liberation of all of Asia. It particularly points out a path towards a new life, new hope, new ideals, and new achievements for Asia. I have been to several cities and met many very good men, women, and children. In their eyes, I clearly saw a sky where peace doves, full of confidence, were soaring peacefully. I have also been to the countryside, visited rural work, and, during my trip, noted the abundant crops in China's farmlands with joy and amazement. In this great agricultural victory, I see the beginning of industrialization. Truly, China is a fortress of peace and life in Asia. Long live China and the Chinese people! Long live the scientists, artists, writers, soldiers, peasants, workers, and students! Long live Chairman Mao, the rising sun of the East!

    印度诗人查托巴迪雅亚返国
    行前发表访问我国的感想
    【新华社广州二十九日电】印度诗人查托巴迪雅亚在我国北京、南京、上海、杭州、广州等城市参观访问后，在二十九日上午离广州经香港回国。到车站欢送的有广州作家协会主席欧阳山等人。
    【新华社广州三十日电】印度诗人查托巴迪雅亚离广州前发表感想，文如下：我认为中国是解放全亚洲的保证。它特别为亚洲指出了一条走向新的生活、新的希望、新的理想和新的成就的道路。我曾经到过几个城市，会见了许多非常好的男女和儿童，在他们的眼中，我清楚地看到一片天空，那里有和平鸽充满自信在安祥地翱翔着。我也曾经到过农村，参观了农村的工作，并且在我的旅途中，怀着欣喜和惊奇的心情，注意了中国农田里的丰盛的庄稼。在这种伟大的农业胜利中，我看到了工业化的开端。真的，中国是亚洲的和平和生命的堡垒。中国和中国人民万岁！科学家、艺术工作者、作家、军人、农民、工人、及学生万岁！东方的旭日毛主席万岁！
