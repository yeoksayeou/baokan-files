    On Volume One of the Complete Works of Stalin
    Hu Sheng
    Volume One of "The Complete Works of Stalin" contains Stalin's writings from 1901 to April 1907. These writings mark the beginning of the great Stalin's glorious revolutionary career of more than fifty years. The sun, just rising from the horizon, already spreads light and heat to the earth. These writings, dating back to the time of the first Russian revolution fifty years ago, can still provide us with a wealth of ideological strength.
    Before the first Russian revolution, the young Stalin had already embraced Marxist ideology and actively participated in leading the workers' movement in the South Caucasus region. He was arrested in 1902. In January 1904, he escaped from exile in Siberia and returned to his post in the South Caucasus to meet the revolutionary high tide of 1905.
    The Russian Revolution of 1905 was a bourgeois democratic revolution. At that time, there were not only bourgeois liberals who opposed the working class in Russia, but also various anti-Marxist factions masquerading under the banner of socialism. Within the Social Democratic movement, there were also various opportunist factions claiming to be Marxist. All these factions acted recklessly, obstructing and confusing the revolutionary path of the proletariat. In this complex situation, Lenin waged a great struggle, laying the ideological, organizational, and tactical foundations for a true Marxist proletarian revolutionary party, and developing the theoretical basis of the Marxist party in the face of all opportunist distortions and slanders.
    Stalin was a fearless warrior who held high the banner of Leninism in the South Caucasus region. In the South Caucasus, as in all of Russia, various confused and reactionary ideological factions were also active in disrupting the revolutionary camp. In this situation, fighting for the principles of Leninism required sufficient theoretical and practical courage.
    Stalin possessed a high degree of theoretical Marxist training at a very early age, and at the same time, he directly threw himself into the workers' movement, sharing the same breath as the working masses struggling for liberation. Therefore, from the very beginning, Stalin was able to clearly recognize that Lenin's line was the only correct line in the Russian revolution. Whether in practical work or in ideological work, Stalin consistently stood on the side of the Bolsheviks led by Lenin and waged an irreconcilable struggle against all anti-Marxist and opportunist factions.
    Volume One of "The Complete Works of Stalin" has a multifaceted and rich content. According to the actual needs in the development of the revolution, Stalin's writings during this period discussed important issues related to the ideological, organizational, and tactical foundations of the Marxist party. In the essay "How Does Social Democracy Understand the National Question?" Stalin established the basic viewpoints of the Marxist-Leninist theory of the national question. In the masterpiece "Anarchism or Socialism?" Stalin profoundly elaborated the dialectical materialist world view and the theory of socialist revolution in combination with the revolutionary practice of the proletariat. …
    Stalin's writings are immortal examples of defending the theoretical and tactical principles of Marxism-Leninism. × × ×
    When Stalin began his revolutionary life, the Russian Marxist revolutionary movement had already developed through the struggle against the Populists (Narodniks). The Populists denied the role of the proletariat in the revolution, vainly hoping to realize socialism without relying on the workers' movement. Lenin's "What the 'Friends of the People' Are" written in 1894 gave the Populist ideology a devastating blow. Stalin accepted Lenin's ideas and from the very beginning made himself a true Marxist relying on the working class. In the first two essays of "The Complete Works of Stalin" it is stated unequivocally: "Only the revolutionary proletariat is entrusted with the historical mission of liberating mankind and seeking happiness for the whole world." (p. 6) "The working masses are the only natural representatives of the socialist ideal." (p. 10) In "Anarchism or Socialism," Stalin described the historical role of the proletariat in such clear terms:
    "Only the class that grows stronger and stronger every day, advances forever, and tirelessly struggles for a better future will always be progressive and can smash the shackles of slavery. We see that the only class that is constantly growing stronger, advancing forever, and struggling for the future is the proletariat of the city and the countryside. Therefore, we should serve the proletariat, we should place our hopes on it." (p. 302)
    Placing hope on the proletariat—this is the fundamental starting point of the great Stalin's life, thought, and career.
    To serve the proletariat, but what kind of service is truly beneficial to the proletariat? —Stalin raised this question in his writings and answered: The reformists in the workers' movement want the proletariat to forget socialism, which can only harm the proletariat; the anarchists want to realize socialism within the scope of individual cities and individual village communities, which can only harm the proletariat; to truly serve the proletariat, we must, like Marx, "call on the proletariat to fight for proletarian socialism based on the broad foundation of modern large-scale industry." (p. 302)
    Stalin said: "To strive for the main purpose of realizing a broad socialist life - this is how we should serve the proletariat." (p. 303)
    That is to say: the fundamental interests of the proletariat are inseparable from the realization of socialism; the socialism of the proletariat must be based on modern large-scale industry, therefore socialism cannot be implemented in individual cities and individual village communities, but can only be implemented within a unified and indivisible national territory.
    To serve the proletariat is to strive for the purpose of realizing such socialism.
    The Populists abandoned the workers' movement and engaged in empty talk about socialism, while the so-called "Economists" who appeared in the Russian revolutionary movement at the end of the 19th century only saw the workers' movement and forgot about socialism. Stalin said: "In the past, utopian socialists only paid attention to the ultimate goal, and were blinded by this goal, completely ignoring or denying the real workers' movement unfolding before their eyes; now, some Russian Social Democrats, on the contrary, focus all their attention only on the spontaneous workers' movement and its daily needs." (p. 13) They are "intoxicated with economic struggles, intoxicated with struggles to partially improve the living conditions of workers (such as shortening working hours and raising wages), willing to completely forget their great responsibilities, their great ideals."
    (p. 13) Economism is also an idea that wants the working class to forget socialism. In Russia in the 1890s, the Economists were the main stumbling block to the revolutionary cause of Marxism.
    Stalin made outstanding contributions to the struggle led by Lenin to build a Marxist workers' party by combating the ideology of the Economists. Many of the arguments put forward by Stalin in "A Brief Account of Differences of Opinion in the Party" and other essays to defend and develop Lenin's ideas are still fresh and vivid to us today. Stalin said: "We should raise the proletariat to the point where it can recognize its true class interests, recognize the ideal of socialism, and never trivialize this ideal or make it adapt to the spontaneous movement. This practical conclusion is precisely built on the theoretical foundation laid by Lenin. As long as you accept this theoretical premise, you will not be infected by any opportunism. This is the significance of Lenin's thought." (p. 48)
    Stalin revealed the harm of Economism to the workers' movement, saying: "Because the banner under which Russian workers are fighting is still an old, faded rag written with trivial slogans of economic struggle, they cannot deeply understand the lofty purpose and content of the struggle as the movement develops, so the workers inevitably participate in this struggle with less energy, less interest, and lower revolutionary enthusiasm, because great energy is only generated for great purposes."
    (p. 16)
    The Russian Economists, following the West European Bernsteinian opportunists, said: "For us, the movement is everything, the ultimate goal is insignificant"; in response to this view, Stalin pointed out, "Great energy is only generated for great purposes." If we follow the former statement, then in the workers' movement we can be satisfied with using some immediate and local interests to form a temporary "upheaval" of the movement; but practical life precisely proves that this "upheaval" is unreliable, and even harmful to the cause of the working class. Practical life can prove the correctness of Stalin's teachings everywhere.
    From this, it can be seen that political and ideological education among the working masses, using the great purpose that conforms to the historical position of the working class to enhance its class consciousness and inspire its revolutionary enthusiasm, is necessary and indispensable at all times.
    Stalin's argument makes us see that if we do not instill scientific socialist ideas into the working class, and do not make the working class consciously combine the current struggle with the ultimate goal of socialism, then we are letting the working masses remain at the low level of spontaneous movement, thus inevitably being dominated by the bourgeois ideological system. The worshippers of spontaneous movement seem to be serving the workers on the surface, but in reality, they are hindering the class consciousness of the working masses, weakening the revolutionary energy of the working masses, and preventing the working masses from escaping the influence of the bourgeoisie.
    Stalin developed Lenin's famous argument in "What Is to Be Done?" that "the spontaneous development of the labor movement tends to subordinate it to bourgeois ideology." While the working class tends toward socialism, it also tends to be dominated by bourgeois ideology. The latter tendency must be noted because the bourgeois ideological system is "much older than the socialist ideological system, more widely disseminated, more deeply rooted in life, and bourgeois viewpoints can be encountered everywhere, both among our own people and among outsiders, while the socialist ideological system has only just taken a few steps, just opened up its own path." (p. 86) Therefore, the spontaneous workers' movement is bound to be dominated by the bourgeois ideological system. Moreover, Stalin said, "Do not forget that the bourgeois thinkers are not dozing off at this time either; they dress up as socialists in their own way, and try their best to make the working class subordinate to the bourgeois ideological system." (p. 86) The ideology of Economism is essentially a manifestation of the influence of bourgeois ideology in the working class.
    Stalin said: "To be dominated by the bourgeois ideological system is to exclude the socialist ideological system, because these two ideological systems are mutually exclusive." (p. 86)
    The great significance of Lenin's and Stalin's criticism of spontaneity for us lies in the fact that they remind us to pay great attention to the struggle against the bourgeois ideological system, and to regard "opposing this tendency to be dominated by the bourgeois ideological system and promoting another tendency, namely the socialist tendency" (p. 87) in the working class as a constant and serious task.
    × × ×
    Since the goal of socialism cannot be achieved by relying on the spontaneous workers' movement, it is necessary to organize the most conscious working-class elements into a working-class party; this party must be able to educate the working masses with socialist ideas, organize and lead the working masses, and move towards the ultimate goal; therefore, this party must be a party armed with Marxist ideas, a centralized, disciplined, and militant working-class revolutionary party. Without such a party, the working class will inevitably go astray, will hardly be able to get rid of the control of the bourgeoisie, and will go through all kinds of hardships without being able to reach the goal of socialism.
    What Lenin and Stalin were striving to build at that time was such a party, and in order to build such a party, they had to fight against various opponents and saboteurs. In many of his writings during this period, Stalin refuted the ideas of the Economists and Mensheviks in accordance with Lenin's ideas and argued for the role of the proletarian party and its organizational principles.
    Stalin pointed out that the view of denying the party inevitably derives from the Economists' worship of spontaneity. Because according to the Economists' view, the party can only be "a docile tool of the spontaneous movement." Neither should socialist consciousness be instilled into the workers' movement, nor should the workers' movement be led. "In a word, the Social Democrats are portrayed as a burden in the movement." (p. 81)
    In contrast to the Economists, Stalin affirmed that the party has a significant role precisely because "it should instill socialist consciousness into the workers' movement, it should always be at the head of the movement, and not stand idly by and be the tail of the spontaneous workers' movement." (p. 82)
    In order to instill socialist consciousness into the workers' movement, it is necessary to carry out propaganda and education work. Lenin's and Stalin's party has always regarded this as a regular and important task. But Lenin and Stalin certainly did not limit the role of the party to propaganda and education work. The proletarian party is a militant and active party, it must always be at the head of the movement in practical life.
    When the revolutionary situation of 1905 had matured, Lenin and Stalin immediately put forward to the party the task of organizing a nationwide armed uprising, so that the party would truly become a vanguard capable of standing in front of the masses and launching an open struggle. Lenin and Stalin resolutely refuted the opportunist ideas of the Mensheviks. At this time, the Mensheviks attempted to keep the party in its usual state, doing some general propaganda and mobilization work as usual, and allowing the masses' struggle to proceed spontaneously. The Mensheviks were actually inheriting the mantle of the Economists. Stalin rebuked them, saying: "Those who worship the spontaneous movement lower the purpose of the party to merely following the course of life, being the tail of the movement, instead of walking at the head of the movement as an advanced and conscious force should." (p. 120)
    In Lenin's and Stalin's view, what is important is that the party must be able to answer the questions raised by practical life in a timely manner, and closely adapt its tactics to the needs of the development of revolutionary practice, so that the party will never lag behind real life. Stalin, addressing those doctrinaire scholars who only know how to carry out general agitation and propaganda in any situation, said: "It is entirely necessary to carry out extensive agitation and propaganda and to implement political leadership over the proletariat. However, if we are only limited to this general task, it is equivalent to either avoiding answering the questions directly raised by practical life, or exposing that we are simply not good at adapting our tactics to the needs of the vigorously developing revolutionary struggle." (p. 120) Like Lenin, Stalin at this time paid close attention to the technical preparations for the uprising, organizing fighting teams, collecting and manufacturing weapons, and so on. Stalin said: "Technically leading and organizationally preparing the all-Russian uprising, this is precisely the new task that practical life has put forward to the proletariat." (p. 121)
    The Mensheviks, when the storm of mass revolution had already risen, still tried their best to avoid the task of being the vanguard, which in practice was to abolish the fighting and revolutionary nature of the party, that is, to abolish the party. If the leader cannot look ahead and see the new problems and new tasks put forward by practical life, then he cannot but tragically fall behind reality, and thus fail to be a leader.
    Stalin's teachings not only make us see that the party must be good at leading the masses in the struggle, but also make us understand why the party can lead the masses in the actual struggle.
    Stalin quoted Engels's saying that the workers' party is "the conscious expression of an unconscious process" and explained: "The party should consciously embark on the path that practical life itself is unconsciously taking, the party should consciously express the kind of thought that boiling life is unconsciously putting forward." (p. 233)
    This means that the "path" taken by the party is not some
    "path" that is imagined out of thin air. Practical life itself was originally advancing in this direction. The party's ability lies in "consciously" expressing the "path" that hundreds of millions of people are "unconsciously" taking in practical life, concentrating it into the party's guidelines, policies, and slogans, and in turn using it to guide practical life. The party relies on the power of the scientific theory of Marxism to keenly feel every new sign in the pulse of practical life, and is able to bravely undertake every new task put forward by practical life, so the party can never be separated from the masses and can always stand in front of the masses to lead them forward.
    Stalin taught that when the entire proletariat cannot yet be raised to the due level of consciousness, then "there must be a conscious leading group to educate the proletarian army with socialist ideas, unite this army, and lead them in the struggle." (p. 56) — This is the role to be played by the fighting and revolutionary workers' class party.
    Since the party is such a fighting and revolutionary leadership organization, then the party cannot but be a unified, centralized, and disciplined organization. Stalin said: "A party aimed at leading the fighting proletariat should not be a casual combination of individuals, but should be a united and centralized organization, because only in this way can it guide the work of the party according to a unified plan." (p. 56)
    The debate at the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party in 1903 on the question of who can be a party member was a debate of great principle. At this congress, the Mensheviks advocated lowering the standards for party members as much as possible, so that people who do not participate in work in the party organization can also become party members; if the Mensheviks' proposal were implemented, it would inevitably lead the party to a state of organizational disunity, making the party unable to become a fighting and revolutionary party. It is very clear that the Mensheviks' opportunism on organizational issues is closely related to their opportunism on program and tactical issues.
    Stalin did not participate in this congress, but he actively carried out the struggle against Menshevik opportunism and promoted the party's organizational principles put forward by Lenin at this congress. In the essay "The Proletariat and the Proletarian Party," written for this purpose, Stalin said:
    "The unity of programmatic viewpoints, tactical viewpoints, and organizational viewpoints is the basis on which our party is built. Only the unity of these viewpoints can bind party members into a centralized party. If the unity of viewpoints is destroyed, the party will also disintegrate." (p. 57)
    Stalin further said that for a party member, it is not enough to just "recognize" the party's viewpoints. "Since our party is a fighting party, it cannot be satisfied with abstractly recognizing its program, tactics, and organizational viewpoints, it must require its party members to realize the viewpoints they recognize." (p. 57) Therefore, the fighting party requires its party members not to "struggle alone and dispersedly," but to struggle in the unified and centralized party organization. Stalin said:
    "...The more closely party members are bound together in a united organization, the better they can fight, and therefore the more completely they can realize the party's program, tactics, and organizational viewpoints. Some people are right when they say that our party is an organization of leaders, not a combination of individuals. Since our party is an organization of leaders, then it is very clear that only those who work in this organization, who consider it their duty to integrate their personal wishes with the wishes of the party and act with the party, can be regarded as a member of this party, as a member of this organization." (p. 58)
    Stalin's teachings make us see how significant it is to fight against decentralism on the party's organizational issues. The struggle between Lenin and Stalin at that time and the Mensheviks can be said to be a struggle against decentralism with the party's principles of unity and centralization. The Mensheviks hypocritically claimed that allowing decentralism and allowing all those who do not like strict discipline to join the party could make the party strong. Lenin and Stalin proved that this attempt could never strengthen the party, but was only a conspiracy to corrupt and disintegrate the party. Stalin said that if our party is not a centralized organization, it will lead to "the party not being a fortress, but a banquet that all sympathizers can freely participate in." (p. 62) Both Lenin and Stalin regarded the tendency to weaken the party's high degree of organization as a bad influence of bourgeois individualism and liberalism.
    The Lenin-Stalin-style invincible party is our glorious example, and we must also crush any form of decentralism and defend the organizational foundation of the party established by Lenin and Stalin. × × ×
    During the 1905 revolution, Lenin brilliantly elaborated the idea of the proletariat's leadership in the bourgeois democratic revolution and the idea of a worker-peasant alliance led by the proletariat in "Two Tactics of Social Democracy in the Democratic Revolution" and other writings. These ideas permeated every newspaper article and street leaflet written by Stalin during this period. These ideas were also fundamentally opposed to the views of the Mensheviks.
    The Mensheviks' tactical viewpoint was likewise a continuation of Economism. Since the Economists limited the activities of the workers' movement to the narrow struggle for daily interests, they were letting the political struggle go to other classes, that is, to the bourgeoisie. When the democratic revolutionary situation against Tsarist rule in Russian society had become increasingly mature at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. At this time, Lenin and Stalin defeated the ideology of Economism to form an independent party of the working class, precisely so that the working class could play an active leading role in the democratic revolution. Therefore, Stalin had already pointed out in his 1901 essay against the Economists: "The Social Democrats should use the new street movement that has already begun, should take the banner of Russian democracy into their own hands and lead Russian democracy to the victory that everyone hopes for!" (p. 23) Stalin also sharply raised the question: "It is of great significance for the Russian democratic cause whether the working class has the ability to stand at the forefront of the overall democratic movement, or acts as a supporting role to the 'intelligentsia,' that is, the bourgeoisie, and follows the tail of the movement." (p. 24)
    The tactical policy put forward by the Mensheviks for the 1905 revolution was to let the bourgeoisie be the leader of the revolution, and to let the proletariat occupy a supporting role. The Mensheviks believed that since the nature of the revolution was a bourgeois revolution, it could only be dominated by the bourgeoisie, and if a temporary revolutionary government were established from the revolution, the proletarian party should not participate. The Mensheviks engaged in empty talk that only socialist revolution was the task of the proletariat, and they used this empty talk to cover up their ideas of surrendering to the bourgeoisie and canceling the revolution. Stalin, based on the Leninist policy, waged a serious struggle against this idea of surrender. Stalin stated in the article "The Provisional Revolutionary Government and Social Democracy" that the proletariat must engage in revolutionary struggle with the peasants and participate in the temporary revolutionary government. Stalin directly said: "The proletariat and the peasants will dominate the streets, they will shed blood and sacrifice themselves. Naturally, they should also dominate in the provisional government." (p. 126)
    "We proletarians should not only participate in today's revolution, but should also play a leading role in this revolution, lead this revolution, and carry this revolution through to the end." (p. 128) Stalin, directly participating in the mass struggle, at that time used such clear language to educate the masses with Lenin's tactical ideas.
    Stalin pointed out that the Mensheviks' proposal was actually the line of the bourgeois liberals. If we act according to the Mensheviks' proposal,
    "the proletariat is bound to become an appendage of the liberals, and will not become an independent force." (p. 252)
    It was precisely because the proletariat wanted to actually grasp the leadership of the revolution in order to oppose the leadership of the bourgeoisie, that Stalin, like Lenin, bravely called on the working masses to "go to the streets," launch armed uprisings, and seize power with the peasants. Lenin and Stalin studied Marx's and Engels's theory on the tactical issues of armed uprisings in the revolutionary storm of 1905, and developed this theory based on the experiences of January and December 1905.
    The tactical policy formulated by Lenin for the working-class party in the 1905 revolution guided the working people of Russia to advance, until they won the great victory of the October Socialist Revolution in 1917. The Chinese revolution basically advanced under the guidance of Lenin's tactical policy. Due to the characteristics of Chinese society, the Chinese revolution has characteristics that are different from the Russian revolution. The Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution carries a serious nature of anti-imperialism, which cannot but affect the social class relations in the Chinese revolution, but the policy that led the Russian revolution to victory under Lenin's leadership is basically applicable to China. The great victory of the Chinese people's democratic revolution, which is led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, is the victory of Lenin's policy under the historical conditions of China. Now that the Chinese democratic revolution has achieved victory, studying the arguments of Lenin and Stalin on the tactical principles of the proletarian party during the Russian revolution of 1905 is still of great significance to us.
    Lenin and Stalin resolutely refuted the Mensheviks' ravings that the democratic revolution can only be the task of the bourgeoisie. The Russian bourgeois liberals, even if they occasionally participated in opposing the Tsarist system, were, as Lenin said, "helping the struggle for freedom with one hand - and this is also very rare - while the other hand always helps the Tsar." (Selected Works of Lenin, Volume 1, p. 710) Stalin had also vividly described it in this way in 1901:
    "The bourgeoisie of all countries and all nations are very good at seizing the fruits that are not obtained by their own victory, and are very good at taking chestnuts out of the fire with the hands of others. They never want to risk their more privileged position in the struggle with strong enemies, in the struggle that is temporarily not easy to win. ... They themselves only 'sympathize' with the struggle ... They are afraid of revolutionary action, and only in the last few minutes of the struggle, when they see that the enemy has no strength, do they themselves turn to revolutionary methods. This principle is taught to us by historical experience ... Only the working class and the general people, who have nothing to lose in the struggle except their own chains, are the real revolutionary forces. Although Russia's experience is still very poor, it also proves this ancient truth taught to us by the history of all revolutionary movements." (p. 18)
    Therefore, a principled distinction must be seen between a bourgeois-led democratic revolution and a proletarian-led democratic revolution. Stalin pointed out at that time: The Russian revolution of 1905 was a bourgeois revolution, "In this respect, it is similar to the French Revolution, whose fruits were enjoyed by the bourgeoisie. But it is equally clear that the differences between these two revolutions are also very great." (p. 235) That is to say, the result of the French Revolution led by the bourgeoisie was a bourgeois dictatorship, while only under the leadership of the proletariat can the democratic revolution be thoroughly carried through to the end and thus cannot exceed the scope of the democratic revolution.
    Stalin said: "In France, the revolution was led by the bourgeoisie, while in Russia it was led by the proletariat. There, the fate of the revolution was dominated by the bourgeoisie, while here it was dominated by the proletariat." (p. 135) "What we need is not the kind of republic established by the French bourgeoisie in the eighteenth century, but the kind of republic demanded by the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party in the twentieth century. Only a victorious people's uprising led by the proletariat and its proposed provisional revolutionary government can establish such a republic." (p. 136)
    Stalin said that realizing the proletariat's leadership and carrying the revolution through to the end is to enable the working class to "fully realize its minimum program, thereby opening up the road to socialism." (p. 236)
    Marxist-Leninist theory scientifically proves that, under the conditions of adhering to the leadership of the proletariat and consolidating and developing the worker-peasant alliance, the transition from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution is consistently linked and interconnected. In Lenin's words in "Two Tactics of Social Democracy in the Democratic Revolution": The proletariat "strives to make the maximum use of the democratic revolution to ensure the proletariat's extremely smooth advance towards socialism." (Selected Works of Lenin, Volume 1, p. 633)
    Therefore, when Lenin explained the actual activities of the proletarian party, he always regarded the struggle for socialism and the struggle for democracy as two closely related activities. Lenin said: Russian Social Democrats "have always insisted that their socialist tasks and democratic tasks are inseparably linked." (Selected Works of Lenin, Volume 1, p. 158) Some of the popular leaflets written by Stalin clearly show that Stalin's activities among the working masses at that time faithfully implemented Lenin's policy. These leaflets, while calling on the masses to fight to overthrow the Tsarist system and establish a democratic republic, also educated the masses with the ultimate goal of socialism, making the working masses understand why the proletariat needs a democratic republic, precisely in order to further realize socialism.
    The development of the Chinese revolution is also basically carried out according to this law. The bourgeois democratic revolution is completed under the leadership of the proletariat, and the result is not a state of bourgeois dictatorship, but a state of people's democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the proletariat. In this country, socialist factors cannot but grow every day and every hour; in this country, capitalist industrialization cannot be implemented, but only socialist industrialization can be implemented. The development of the Chinese revolution is once again proving the truth of Marxism-Leninism: carrying the democratic revolution through to the end is the closest, straightest, and widest road to socialism.
    × × ×
    Stalin's theoretical work "Anarchism or Socialism," published in 1906 and 1907, fully demonstrates the significant role of theory in the proletarian revolutionary movement.
    Stalin said: "Marxism is not just a theory of socialism, but a complete world view, a philosophical system, and Marx's proletarian socialism naturally arises from this philosophical system. This philosophical system is called dialectical materialism." (p. 274)
    Stalin makes us see that only by using the dialectical materialist world view to analyze and study the development process of social history can socialism "not only be a wonderful ideal or fantasy," but be built on irrefutable scientific grounds. At the same time, it is precisely the dialectical materialist world view that makes people see clearly how to act in order to achieve the goal of socialism.
    Stalin uses extremely vivid language to express the essence of the Marxist dialectical method: "The dialectical method says: we must examine life according to the real situation of life. We see that life is in constant motion, so we should examine life as something that is moving, and ask: where is life going? We see that life is a picture of constant destruction and creation, so we should examine life as a process of both destruction and creation, and ask: what is being destroyed in life, and what is being created?" (p. 275)
    Thus our task lies in defending and developing that which is newly produced and growing day by day in life, and in pushing that which is increasingly decaying and aging in life to death.
    Starting from the principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, Stalin elucidated the necessity of socialist revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, the nature and role of the proletarian party, and also elucidated the foundations of the party's strategy and tactics. — These fundamental issues in Marxist-Leninist theory are all developed in an extremely concise and vivid manner in the work "Anarchism or Socialism."
    Stalin's work, like many classic theoretical works of Marxism-Leninism, is written in the form of a polemic. This work makes us see that defending the theoretical foundation of the Marxist-Leninist party has extremely important significance.
    The fighting brilliance of Marxism-Leninism is radiated in every page and every line of Stalin's writings. This brilliance not only illuminates all practical problems in the Russian revolution at that time, but also illuminates the road to liberation for all mankind in the world.
    The publication of the Chinese version of "The Complete Works of Stalin" will enable us to better arm ourselves with the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. In our advance towards the great goals of socialism and communism, we will be able to infinitely increase our confidence and continuously improve our abilities by the teachings given by Stalin's writings.

    关于斯大林全集第一卷
    胡绳
    “斯大林全集”第一卷包含斯大林在一九○一年到一九○七年四月的著作。这些著作标志着伟大斯大林的五十多年的光辉灿烂的革命生涯的发端。太阳在刚从地平线升起时已经把光和热散布到大地。这些远在五十年前第一次俄国革命时期的著作，至今仍然可以让我们从中吸取丰富的思想的力量。
    在第一次俄国革命时期以前，青年的斯大林已经接受了马克思主义思想，在南高加索地区积极地参加领导工人运动。他在一九○二年被捕。一九○四年一月他从西伯利亚的流放所脱逃，仍回到南高加索地区的工作岗位上，迎接了一九○五年的革命高潮。
    一九○五年的俄国革命的性质是资产阶级民主革命。当时在俄国不但有反对工人阶级的资产阶级自由派，而且有各种打着社会主义招牌的反马克思主义的派别，在社会民主党的运动中也有各种自命为马克思主义的机会主义派别。所有这些派别都曾放肆地活动，阻挠和混乱无产阶级的革命道路。列宁在这种纷歧错杂的情势下，进行了巨大的斗争，为真正的马克思主义的无产阶级革命政党奠定了思想基础、组织基础和策略基础，并对抗着一切机会主义的曲解和诬蔑而发展了马克思主义政党的理论基础。
    斯大林是在南高加索地区高举起列宁主义的旗帜的无畏的战士。在南高加索，和全俄国一样，也同样有各种混乱的和反动的思想的派别活动来扰乱革命阵营，在这种情形下，为列宁主义的原则而斗争不能不具有足够的理论勇气和实践勇气。
    斯大林在很早的时候就拥有马克思主义的高度的理论修养，同时他又直接投身在工人运动中，和为求解放而斗争的工人群众呼吸相共。因此，斯大林一开始就能明确地认定列宁的路线是俄国革命中唯一正确的路线。无论在实际工作还是在思想工作中，斯大林始终一贯地站在以列宁为首的布尔什维克方面，和一切反马克思主义派别及机会主义派别进行了不调和的斗争。
    “斯大林全集”第一卷具有多方面的丰富的内容。按照革命发展中的实际需要，斯大林在这一时期的著作中论述了有关马克思主义政党的思想基础、组织基础和策略基础的重要问题。在“社会民主党怎样理解民族问题的？”这一论文中，斯大林确立了马克思列宁主义的民族问题理论的基本观点。在“无政府主义还是社会主义”这个杰作中，斯大林把辩证唯物主义的世界观和社会主义革命的理论结合着无产阶级的革命实践而作了深刻的阐述。……
    斯大林的这些著作是捍卫马克思列宁主义的理论与策略原则的不朽的典型。×  ×  ×
    当斯大林开始其革命生活时，俄国的马克思主义革命运动已经通过对民粹派的斗争而发展起来。民粹派否认无产阶级在革命中的作用，妄想不依靠工人运动而实现社会主义。列宁在一八九四年所著“什么是‘人民之友’”给予民粹派思想以毁灭性的打击。斯大林接受了列宁思想，从一开始就使自己成为一个依靠工人阶级的真正马克思主义者。在“斯大林全集”的最初两篇论文中这样斩钉截铁地说：“只有革命无产阶级才负有解放人类并为全世界谋幸福的历史使命。”（页六）“工人群众才是社会主义理想唯一天然的代表者。”（页十）斯大林在“无政府主义还是社会主义”中用如此鲜明的语句来描述无产阶级的历史作用：
    “只有天天成长壮大、永远前进并不倦地为美好的未来而斗争的阶级才会始终是进步的，才能粉碎奴役的枷锁。我们看到，不断成长壮大、永远前进并为未来而斗争的唯一阶级就是城市和乡村的无产阶级。因此，我们应当为无产阶级服务，应该把自己的希望寄托在它的身上。”（页三○二）
    把希望寄托在无产阶级身上，这就是伟大斯大林的一生思想和事业的基本出发点。
    要为无产阶级服务，但怎样的服务才是真正有利于无产阶级呢？——斯大林在他的著作中提出这个问题并答复说：工人运动中的改良主义者要无产阶级忘掉社会主义，那只能使无产阶级受到损害；无政府主义者想以个别城市和个别村社为范围来实现社会主义，那也只能使无产阶级受到损害；真正为无产阶级服务必须像马克思那样“号召无产阶级去争取以广阔的现代大工业基础为依据的无产阶级社会主义”。（页三○二）
    斯大林说：“为实现广泛的社会主义生活这一主要目的而奋斗，——我们就应当这样为无产阶级服务”。（页三○三）
    这也就是说：无产阶级的根本利益是和实现社会主义分不开的；无产阶级的社会主义必须以现代大工业为基础，因而社会主义不能实行于个别城市和个别村社中，而只能实行于统一的不可分的全国领域内。
    为无产阶级服务，就是要为实现这样的社会主义的目的而奋斗。
    民粹派是把工人运动丢在一边空谈社会主义，而在十九世纪末俄国革命运动中出现的所谓“经济派”则是只看见工人运动而忘掉了社会主义。斯大林说：“从前空想社会主义者只注意到最终目的，并为这个目的所眩惑而完全忽视或者否认在他们眼前展开的现实的工人运动；现在某些俄国社会民主主义者则恰好相反，他们把自己的全部注意力只放在自发的工人运动及其日常需要方面。”（页十三）他们“醉心于经济斗争，醉心于局部地改善工人生活状况的斗争（例如缩短工作时间和提高工资），甘愿把自己的伟大职责、自己的伟大理想完全忘掉。”
    （页十三）经济主义也就是一种要工人阶级忘掉社会主义的思想。在九十年代的俄国，经济派是马克思主义的革命事业的主要绊脚石。
    在当时列宁为了建立马克思主义工人政党而领导进行的对经济派思想的斗争中，斯大林作了出色的贡献。斯大林在“略论党内意见分歧”及其他论文中为保卫和发挥列宁的思想而提出的许多论证，至今对我们都是新鲜的、生动的。斯大林说：“我们应把无产阶级提高到能够认识真实的阶级利益，认识社会主义的理想，而决不是把这个理想琐碎化，或者使它去适应自发运动。这个实际结论正是建筑在列宁所奠定的理论基础上面。只要接受了这个理论前提，任何机会主义都沾染不上你。列宁思想的意义就在于此。”（页四八）
    斯大林揭露经济主义思想对于工人运动的危害说：“由于俄国工人在进行斗争时所打的旗帜仍然是一块写着经济斗争琐碎口号的陈旧褪色的破布，他们就不能随着运动的发展深刻地了解斗争的崇高目的和内容，所以工人们也就不免以较少的精力、较小的兴趣、较低的革命热情来参加这个斗争，因为伟大的精力只是为了伟大的目的而产生的。”
    （页十六）
    俄国的经济派跟着西欧的伯恩施坦派机会主义者说：“对我们，运动就是一切，最终目的是微不足道的”；针对这种观点，斯大林指出，“伟大的精力只是为了伟大的目的而产生的”。如果照前一种说法，那么我们在工人运动中就可以满足于用某种眼前的局部的利益来形成暂时的运动的“热潮”；但实际生活恰恰证明，这种“热潮”是不可靠的，甚至是有害于工人阶级的事业的。实际生活处处可以证明斯大林的教导的正确性。
    由此可见在工人群众中进行政治思想教育，用符合于工人阶级历史地位的伟大目的来提高其阶级觉悟、鼓舞其革命热情，这在任何时候都是必要的，不可缺少的。
    斯大林所作的论证使我们看到，如果不把科学的社会主义思想灌输到工人阶级中间去，不使工人阶级自觉地把当前的斗争和社会主义最终目的结合起来，那就是让工人群众停留在自发运动的低级水平上，从而不能不为资产阶级思想体系所支配。自发运动的崇拜者表面上好像是为工人服务，实际上却是妨害工人群众的阶级觉悟，减弱工人群众的革命精力，使工人群众跑不出资产阶级的影响。
    斯大林发挥了列宁在“做什么？”中所说“工人运动自发的发展过程，就有受资产阶级思想体系支配的倾向”这个著名的论点。工人阶级固然是倾向于社会主义的，但同时又有受资产阶级思想体系支配的倾向。后一种倾向之所以必须注意是因为，资产阶级思想体系较社会主义思想体系“要老得多，传播的范围要广得多，在生活中扎下的根要深得多，无论在自己人中间或外人中间，到处都可以碰到资产阶级的观点，而社会主义的思想体系则刚刚开始走了几步，刚刚给自己开辟道路。”（页八六）因此自发的工人运动就势必受资产阶级思想体系所支配。而且斯大林说，“不要忘记，资产阶级的思想家这时也并没有打瞌睡，他们照自己的办法装扮成社会主义者，竭力想使工人阶级受资产阶级思想体系的支配。”（页八六）经济派思想在实质上就是资产阶级思想在工人阶级中的影响的表现。
    斯大林说：“受资产阶级思想体系支配就是排斥社会主义思想体系，因为这两种思想体系是互相否定的。”（页八六）
    列宁、斯大林对自发论的批判对我们的重大意义就在于他们提醒我们要十分重视对资产阶级思想体系的斗争，要把在工人阶级中“反对这种受资产阶级思想体系支配的倾向，而促进另一种倾向即社会主义的倾向”（页八七）当做经常的严重任务。
    ×    ×    ×
    要达到社会主义的目的，既然不能依靠自发的工人运动，那就必须把最觉悟的工人阶级分子组成工人阶级政党；这个党要能用社会主义思想教育工人群众，要能组织和领导工人群众，向最后的目的前进，因此，这个党必须是以马克思主义思想武装起来的党，是集中的、有纪律的、战斗的工人阶级革命政党。没有这样的党，工人阶级就难免于彷徨歧途，就很难摆脱资产阶级的支配，就将历尽艰险而不能达到社会主义的目的。
    列宁和斯大林当时所力求建设的就是这样的党，为建设这样的党，他们曾必须和各种反对者和破坏者进行斗争。斯大林在这时期的许多著作中按照列宁的思想驳斥了经济派和孟什维克派的思想而论证了无产阶级党的作用及其组织原则。
    斯大林指出，从崇拜自发性的经济派思想中，不可免地引申出否认党的观点。因为照经济派的看法，党就只能是“自发运动的驯服的工具”。既不要把社会主义意识灌输到工人运动中去，也不要去领导工人运动。“一句话，社会民主党被描绘成运动中的累赘。”（页八一）
    和经济派相反，斯大林肯定，党之所以有重大作用，正是因为“它应该把社会主义意识灌输到工人运动中去，应该始终走在运动的前头，而不要冷眼旁观，做自发工人运动的尾巴。”（页八二）
    为了把社会主义意识灌输到工人运动中去，需要进行宣传教育工作。列宁斯大林的党从来把这看做是一个经常的重要的工作。但列宁和斯大林当然不是把党的作用仅限于宣传教育工作。无产阶级的党是战斗的行动的党，它必须在实际生活中始终走在运动的前头。
    在一九○五年革命形势已经成熟时，列宁和斯大林立即向党提出组织全民武装起义的任务，要使党确确实实成为能够站在群众前面发动公开斗争的先锋队。列宁和斯大林坚决驳斥了孟什维克的机会主义思想。孟什维克在这时候企图党停留在平常时候的状态，照常做一些一般的宣传鼓动工作，而听任群众的斗争自发地进行。孟什维克其实是继承了经济派的衣钵。斯大林加以斥责说：“崇拜自发运动的人把党的目的降低到仅仅跟在生活进程的后面，做了运动的尾巴，而不像先进的觉悟部队所应做的那样走在运动的前头。”（页一二○）
    在列宁、斯大林看来，重要的是，党必须能够及时回答实际生活所提出的问题，使自己的策略密切适应革命实践发展的需要，从而使党永不落后于现实生活。斯大林针对那在任何情形下只知道进行一般的鼓动宣传的学究主义者说：“广泛进行鼓动和宣传，对无产阶级实行政治领导是完全必要的。然而，若是仅仅限于这种一般性的任务，就等于我们不是避免回答实际生活所直接提出的问题，就是暴露我们根本不善于使自己的策略适应蓬勃发展的革命斗争的需要。”（页一二○）和列宁一样，斯大林在这时十分注意起义的技术准备工作，组织战斗队，收集和制造武器等等。斯大林说：“在技术上领导和在组织上准备全俄起义，这正是实际生活向无产阶级提出来的新任务。”（页一二一）
    孟什维克在群众革命风暴已经起来的时候，仍尽力躲避作为先锋队的任务，这在实际上就是取消了党的战斗的革命的性质，也就是取消了党。领导者如果不能向前看，看到实际生活提出来的新的问题，新的任务，那就不能不悲惨地落在现实后面，因而不成其为领导者。
    斯大林的教导不仅使我们看出党必须善于在斗争中领导群众，而且还使我们懂得，党为什么能够在实际斗争中领导群众。
    斯大林引用了恩格斯所说工人政党是“不自觉过程的自觉表现者”这句话而加以阐明说：“党应当自觉地走上实际生活本身所不自觉地走着的那条路，党应当自觉地表达沸腾的生活所不自觉地提出的那种思想。”（页二三三）
    这就是说，党所走的“路”并不是什么凭空想
    出来的“路”。实际生活本身原来就是按照这个方向前进的。党的本领就在于把千百万群众在实际生活中“不自觉”地走着的“路”，“自觉”地表达出来，集中为党的方针、政策、口号，反过来用以指导实际生活。党依靠马克思主义的科学理论的力量而能够敏锐地感触到实际生活的脉搏跳动中每一个新的征象，而又能够勇敢地担当实际生活所提出的每一个新的任务，因此党能够永远不脱离群众而又永远站在群众前面领导群众前进。
    斯大林教导说：当整个无产阶级还不能提高到应有的觉悟程度时，就“必须有一个觉悟的领导集团用社会主义思想教育无产者大军，把这支大军联合起来，并在斗争中领导他们”。（页五六）——这就是战斗的、革命的工人阶级政党所要起的作用。
    既然党是这样的战斗的、革命的领导组织，那么党也就不能不是统一的、集中的、有纪律的组织。斯大林说：“一个以领导战斗的无产阶级为目的的政党，就不应当是个人的偶然凑合，而应当是团结一致的集中的组织，因为只有这样，才能按照统一的计划指导党的工作。”（页五六）
    在一九○三年俄国社会民主工党第二次代表大会上关于什么人能做党员问题的争论是具有重大原则性的争论。孟什维克在这次大会上主张把党员的标准尽量降低，让不在党的组织中参加工作的人也可以成为党员；如果实行孟什维克的主张，那就必然使党趋于组织涣散的状态，使党不能成为战斗的革命的党。很显然的，孟什维克在组织问题上的机会主义是和他们在纲领问题及策略问题上的机会主义密切相联系着的。
    斯大林没有参加这次代表大会，但他积极地进行了反对孟什维克机会主义的斗争，宣传列宁在这次大会上所提出的党的组织原则。在为这目的而写的论文“无产阶级和无产阶级政党”中，斯大林说：
    “纲领观点、策略观点和组织观点的一致是和我们党赖以建立的基础，只有这些观点的一致才能把党员结成一个集中的党。如果观点的一致被破坏了，党也就要瓦解。”（页五七）
    斯大林又进一步说，就一个党员说来，如果只“承认”党的观点是还不够的。“既然我们的党是一个战斗的党，它就不能满足于抽象地承认它的纲领、策略和组织观点，它一定要求它的党员实现他所承认的观点。”（页五七）因此，战斗的党就要求它的党员不是“单独地分散地进行斗争”，而是在统一的集中的党的组织中进行斗争。斯大林说：
    “……党员愈能紧密地结成一个团结一致的组织，就愈能更好地进行斗争，因而也就愈能更完满地实现党的纲领、策略和组织观点。有些人说得对，我们党是领导者的组织，而不是个人的凑合。既然我们党是领导者的组织，那末很明显，只有在这个组织中工作、认为自己的义务是把个人愿望同党的愿望融为一体并和党一起行动的人，才能算做这个党的一员，算做这个组织的一员。”（页五八）
    斯大林的教导使我们看到，在党的组织问题上和分散主义作斗争是具有何等重大的意义。列宁斯大林当时和孟什维克的斗争可以说就是用党的统一集中的原则来反对分散主义的斗争。孟什维克虚伪地宣称，容许分散主义，让一切不喜欢严格纪律的人都加入党来，才能使党强大。列宁和斯大林证明，这种企图决不能加强党，而只是败坏和瓦解党的阴谋。斯大林说，如果我们的党不是一个集中的组织，那就会弄到“党并不是一座堡垒，而是一切同情者都可以自由参加的宴会”。（页六二）列宁和斯大林都把减弱党的高度组织性的倾向看做是资产阶级的个人主义和自由主义的恶劣影响。
    列宁斯大林式的百战百胜的党是我们的光辉的榜样，我们也必须粉碎任何形式的分散主义，保卫列宁斯大林所确立的党的组织基础。×    ×    ×
    在一九○五年的革命期间，列宁在“社会民主党在民主革命中的两个策略”和其他著作中光辉地阐发了无产阶级在资产阶级民主革命中的领导权思想和以无产阶级为领导的工农联盟的思想，这些思想渗透在斯大林在这时期所写的每一篇报纸论文和街头传单中。这些思想也是和孟什维克的观点根本对立的。
    孟什维克的策略观点同样是经济主义的继承。经济派既然把工人运动的活动限制在日常利益的狭隘斗争中，那就是把政治斗争让给别的阶级，也就是让给资产阶级。当十九世纪末年和二十世纪开头时，俄国社会中反对沙皇统治的民主革命形势已经日益成熟。在这时候，列宁和斯大林击败经济主义思想以组成工人阶级独立政党，正是为了使工人阶级能够在民主革命中起积极的领导作用。所以斯大林在一九○一年的反对经济派的论文中已指出：“社会民主党应当利用已经开始的新的街头运动，应当把俄国民主主义的旗帜拿到自己手里并把俄国民主主义引向大家所盼望的胜利！”（页二三）斯大林又尖锐地提出问题说：“工人阶级有本事站在总的民主主义运动的前头呢，还是作为‘知识界’即资产阶级的配角去做运动的尾巴，这对于俄国民主事业是有非常重大意义的。”（页二四）
    孟什维克对于一九○五年的革命所提出的策略方针，就是让资产阶级做革命的领袖，而让无产阶级居于配角的地位。孟什维克认为，既然革命的性质是资产阶级革命，那就只能以资产阶级为主，如果从革命中成立临时革命政府，无产阶级政党也不应该参加。孟什维克空谈只有社会主义革命才是无产阶级的任务，他们用这种空谈来掩盖自己的投降资产阶级、取消革命的思想。斯大林根据列宁主义的方针和这种投降思想作了严肃的斗争。斯大林在
    “临时革命政府和社会民主党”一文中说明无产阶级一定要和农民在一起从事革命斗争，并参加临时革命政府。斯大林直截了当地说：“无产阶级和农民将在街头占统治地位，他们将流血牺牲。自然他们在临时政府中也应当占统治地位。”（页一二六）
    “我们无产者不仅应当参加今天的革命，并且应当在这个革命中起带头作用，领导这个革命，把这个革命进行到底。”（页一二八）直接参与着群众斗争的斯大林当时就是用这样明快的语言来把列宁的策略思想教育群众。
    斯大林指出，孟什维克的主张实际上乃是资产阶级自由派的路线。如果按照孟什维克的主张做，
    “无产阶级势必变成自由派的附属品，而不会变成独立的力量”。（页二五二）
    就因为要使无产阶级实际上掌握革命领导权，以反对资产阶级的领导权，所以斯大林和列宁一样，勇敢地号召工人群众“走向街头”，发动武装起义，和农民一起夺取政权。列宁和斯大林在一九○五年的革命风暴中研究了马克思、恩格斯关于武装起义的策略问题的学说，并且根据一九○五年一月和十二月的经验发展了这个学说。
    列宁在一九○五年革命中为工人阶级政党所制定的策略方针引导俄国的劳动人民前进，一直到在一九一七年赢得了十月社会主义革命的伟大胜利。中国革命基本上也是在列宁的策略方针指导下前进的。由于中国社会的特点，中国革命具有和俄国革命不同的特点。中国资产阶级民主革命带着反帝国主义的严重性质，这就不能不影响到中国革命中的社会阶级关系，但是列宁领导俄国革命取得胜利的方针在基本上是适用于中国的。中国以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主革命的伟大胜利，就是列宁的方针在中国的历史条件下的胜利。现在在中国民主革命已经取得胜利的时候，研究列宁斯大林在一九○五年俄国革命时期关于无产阶级政党的策略原则的论证，对我们仍然有重大的意义。
    对于民主革命只能是资产阶级的任务这种孟什维克的呓语，列宁和斯大林都曾给以坚决的驳斥。俄国的资产阶级自由派即使偶而参加反对沙皇制度，但他们也是如列宁所说“用一只手——而且这也是很稀少的事情——帮助争取自由的斗争，而另一只手始终都援助沙皇”。（列宁文选卷一，页七一○）斯大林在一九○一年也曾这样生动地描写说：
    “一切国家和一切民族的资产阶级都极善于攫取并非由自己的胜利所得来的果实，都极善于假他人之手火中取栗。他们从来也不愿意在与强敌斗争中，在暂时还不大容易取得胜利的斗争中，拿自己的较有特权的地位去冒险。……他们自己只是‘同情’斗争……他们是害怕革命行动的，只有在斗争的最后几分钟，当看清敌人没有力量的时候，他们自己才转而采取革命的办法。这个道理是历史经验教给我们的……只有在斗争中除了自己的锁链而外别无可失的工人阶级和一般人民才是真正的革命力量。尽管俄国的经验还很贫乏，却也证明了一切革命运动的历史所教给我们的这个古老的真理。”（页十八）
    因此，在资产阶级领导的民主革命和无产阶级领导的民主革命之间不能不看出原则性的区别。斯大林当时指出：一九○五年的俄国革命是资产阶级革命，“在这方面，它是和那被资产阶级享受了果实的法国大革命相似的。但是同样很明显，这两个革命之间的区别也是很大的。”（页二三五）这就是说，资产阶级领导的法国革命的结果是资产阶级专政，而只有在无产阶级领导下，民主革命才能彻底进行到底并从而不能不超过民主革命的范围。
    斯大林说：“在法国，领导革命的是资产阶级，在俄国则是无产阶级。在那里，支配革命命运的是资产阶级，在这里则是无产阶级”。（页一三五）“我们所需要的并不是十八世纪法国资产阶级所建立的那种共和国，而是二十世纪俄国社会民主工党所要求的共和国。只有无产阶级领导的胜利的人民起义和它提出的临时革命政府才能把这样的共和国建立起来。”（页一三六）
    斯大林说，实现无产阶级领导权，把革命进行到底，就是为了使工人阶级“完全实现自己的最低纲领，从而开辟走向社会主义的道路”。（页二三六）
    马克思列宁主义的理论科学地证明，在坚持无产阶级领导权和巩固发展工农联盟的条件下，从民主主义革命到社会主义革命是一贯相联，一脉相通的。用列宁在“社会民主党在民主革命中的两个策略”中的说法就是：无产阶级“力求最高限度利用民主革命来保证无产阶级极顺利地向前争取社会主义”。（列宁文选卷一，页六三三）
    所以列宁在说明无产阶级政党的实际活动时总是把为社会主义的斗争和为民主主义的斗争看作密切联系的两种活动。列宁说：俄国社会民主党人“始终坚持说他们社会主义任务与民主主义任务有分不开的联系”。（列宁文选卷一，页一五八）斯大林所写的一些通俗的传单显著地表明，斯大林当时在工人群众中的活动是忠实地执行了列宁的方针。这些传单在号召群众为推翻沙皇制度，建立民主共和国而斗争时，又用社会主义的最后目的来教育群众，使工人群众懂得无产阶级之所以需要民主共和国，就是为了进一步实现社会主义。
    中国革命的发展基本上也是按照这个规律进行的。资产阶级民主革命在无产阶级领导下完成，其结果出现的就不是资产阶级专政的国家，而是无产阶级领导下的人民民主专政的国家。在这个国家里，社会主义因素不能不每天每时地增长起来；在这个国家里，不能实行资本主义的工业化，而只能实行社会主义工业化。中国革命的发展正在又一次地证明马克思列宁主义的真理：把民主革命进行到底就是通向社会主义的最近最直的大路。

    斯大林在一九○六和一九○七年间发表的“无政府主义还是社会主义”这一理论著作充分地表明了理论对于无产阶级革命运动的重大作用。
    斯大林说：“马克思主义不只是社会主义的理论，而且是一个完整的世界观，是一个哲学体系，马克思的无产阶级社会主义就是从这个哲学体系中自然而然产生出来的。这个哲学体系叫做辩证唯物主义。”（页二七四）
    斯大林使我们看到，只有运用辩证唯物主义的世界观来分析和研究社会历史的发展过程，才使得社会主义“不只是一种美妙的理想或幻想”，而是建立在不能违抗的科学根据上的。同时也正是辩证唯物主义的世界观使得人们看清楚，应该怎样行动才能够达到社会主义的目的。
    斯大林用极为生动的语言来表述马克思主义辩证方法的精萃：“辩证方法说：必须按生活的实在情形来考察生活。我们看到生活处在不断的运动中，所以我们应当把生活当做动的东西来考察，并且要问：生活走向哪里去？我们看到生活是一幅不断破坏和创造的图画，所以我们应当把生活当做既破坏又创造的过程来考察，并且要问：生活中破坏的是什么，创造的是什么？”（页二七五）
    这样我们的任务就在于去卫护和发展那在生活中新产生的一天天成长的东西，就在于把那在生活中日益腐朽衰老的东西推送到死亡。
    由辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的原理出发，斯大林阐明了社会主义革命和无产阶级专政的必要性问题，无产阶级政党的性质和作用的问题，同时也阐明了党的战略与策略的基础。——这些在马克思列宁主义理论中的根本问题都在“无政府主义还是社会主义”这一著作中得到极其简明而生动的发挥。
    斯大林的这个著作，正如马克思列宁主义的许多经典理论著作一样，是以论战形式写的。这个著作使我们看到捍卫马克思列宁主义政党的理论基础具有极其重大的意义。
    马克思列宁主义的战斗光芒散发在斯大林著作的每一页每一行中，这个光芒不仅照明了当时俄国革命中的一切实践问题，而且为全世界人类照明了通向解放的大路。
    “斯大林全集”中文版的开始出版将使我们能够更好地用马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说来把我们自己武装起来。在我们向社会主义和共产主义的伟大目标前进中，我们将能够由斯大林的著作所给的教导而无限地增强我们的信心，不断地提高我们的本领。
