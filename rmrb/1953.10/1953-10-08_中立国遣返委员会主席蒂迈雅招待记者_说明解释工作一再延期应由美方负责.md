Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th: Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, presented many facts at a press conference held in Panmunjom on the afternoon of the 6th, clearly showing that the US side should bear the responsibility for the repeated postponements of explanatory work with prisoners of war. The US deliberately delayed the construction of necessary explanatory facilities in the southern prisoner-of-war camps.

General Thimayya said that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army had completed the construction of explanatory facilities in the northern prisoner-of-war camps on the 5th. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission again requested the US side on the 5th to "construct permanent facilities for explanatory work as quickly as possible, and at the same time immediately complete the construction of temporary explanatory venues in accordance with regulations." He said, "We are now waiting for the United Nations Command to notify us of the completion date of these buildings."

General Thimayya pointed out that the Korean and Chinese sides had agreed to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's suggestion to extend the explanatory period, but the United Nations Command did not agree to the extension.

He emphasized that whether the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission can succeed depends on whether it can "smoothly carry out this important task," which is to explain to the prisoners of war in accordance with the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission."

General Thimayya told nearly one hundred journalists from both sides: "There are strict organizations in the prisoner-of-war camps. It seems that no prisoner of war can be disloyal to these organizations." "It is incorrect to say that all 23,000 prisoners of war are unwilling to return to the North because more than one hundred and ten prisoners of war have escaped and expressed their willingness to go home. In the process, some of these people have been beaten. For example, when we rescued one or two prisoners of war, they were sitting on the ground, and other prisoners of war immediately stepped forward to beat them." General Thimayya said: Although there is a danger of being shot or killed when climbing over the barbed wire, they still want to escape. "This makes us wonder if there are more people who want to go back, but don't have the courage to do so."

General Thimayya formally announced that a Chinese prisoner of war was missing from Camp No. D-28. According to a recent report from a returning Chinese prisoner of war, this prisoner of war was murdered on October 3rd, and his body was buried in this camp. He was killed because he revealed his desire to return home. According to General Thimayya, they are still continuing to investigate this act of preventing repatriation.

General Thimayya said that the Indian Custodial Forces are "very clear" about the fact that in addition to weapons like flagpoles with spearheads that were secretly brought into the prisoner-of-war camps, a large number of weapons, including daggers, have been privately manufactured in the prisoner-of-war camps. According to returning Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, these weapons were manufactured by Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee's secret agents in the prisoner-of-war camps to kill prisoners of war who dared to express their desire to return home and to deal with Indian troops in the event of a "large-scale escape."

General Thimayya cited three channels through which secret agents in the southern prisoner-of-war camps received instructions from the outside: the first channel is the hospital in the Indian custodial area, which has forty to fifty South Korean personnel and some US military officers working there; another channel is the garbage truck driver who comes to the prisoner-of-war camp every morning; and the third channel is the signals sent to the prisoner-of-war camp from the mountains near the southern edge of the demilitarized zone. He said, "We have tried to translate these signals, but they are in a strange language that we cannot understand." The method of communication between the prisoner-of-war camps is to wrap stones in written papers and throw them back and forth between the camps. General Thimayya said that Indian troops had intercepted some of these letters, which contained orders to launch demonstrations and notices about when the Neutral Nations and Korean-Chinese observer representatives would arrive.

An American reporter asked General Thimayya how he reacted to Syngman Rhee's threats to fight Indian troops and seize prisoners of war. General Thimayya said: "Why should we bother about this? The United Nations Command has guaranteed the safety of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces."

    中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅招待记者
    说明解释工作一再延期应由美方负责
    并表示将继续调查战俘营内阻止遣返的暴行事件
    【新华社开城七日电】　中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将六日下午在板门店举行的记者招待会上提出了许多事实，清楚地说明使对战俘的解释工作一再延期进行的责任，应由美方担负。美方故意拖延在南部战俘营修建必要的解释设备的工作。
    蒂迈雅将军说，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面已在五日完成北部战俘营的解释设备的修建工作。中立国遣返委员会五日再度要求美方“以最快的速度修建供解释工作之用的永久性设备，同时应立即完成依照规定的临时性的解释场所的修建工作”。他说：“我们现在在等待联军司令部通知完成这些建筑的日期”。
    蒂迈雅将军指出：朝中方面已同意中立国遣返委员会关于顺延解释期限的建议，但是联军司令部不同意顺延。
    他强调说，中立国遣返委员会的工作是否能成功，要看是否能够“顺利执行这个重要任务”而定，这个任务就是，按照“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定，对战俘进行解释。
    蒂迈雅将军告诉双方将近一百位新闻记者说：“在战俘营中有着严密的组织。看来没有战俘能够不忠于这些组织”。“说二万三千名战俘全都不愿意回到北方去，是不正确的。因为已有一百一十多名战俘逃出来表示愿意回家。在这个过程中，这些人当中有些人曾挨过打。譬如说，我们把一两名战俘救出来的时候，他们正坐在地上，其他战俘立即走上前去打他”。蒂迈雅将军说：虽然在爬过铁丝网时有被枪击的危险或被打死的危险，但是他们还是想逃出去。“这使我们想到是不是还有更多的人想回去，但是没有勇气这样做。”
    蒂迈雅将军正式宣布D二十八号战俘营场内失踪了一名中国战俘。据最近回来的中国战俘报告：这名战俘已在十月三日被害了，他的尸体就被埋在这个营场里，他被害的原因是因为他透露了想回家的愿望。据蒂迈雅将军说，他们现在还在继续调查这一阻止遣返的暴行事件。
    蒂迈雅将军说，印度看管部队已“十分清楚地知道”这样一个事实：除了被偷偷带入战俘营的像装有矛头的旗杆这一类的武器以外，战俘营中还一直在私造大量的包括匕首在内的武器。据回来的朝中战俘说，这些武器是国民党的和李承晚的特务分子们在战俘营内制造的，目的是用来杀害那些敢于表示想回家的战俘，并在一旦发生“大规模逃跑”时对付印度部队。
    蒂迈雅将军举出了南部战俘营中的特务得到外面的指示的三个途径：第一个途径是印度看管区内的医院，这医院内有四五十名南朝鲜人员和一些美军军官担任工作，另一个途径是每天早晨到战俘营来的垃圾车驾驶员，第三个途径就是非军事区南面附近山头上向战俘营发出的信号。他说：“我们曾试图翻译这些信号，但是它们用的是那种我们无法懂得的奇怪文字。”战俘营营场之间的通讯方法则是把写好了的纸包了石头在营场之间扔来扔去。蒂迈雅将军说，印度部队曾截获到一些这类的信件，上面是关于发动示威的命令和关于中立国及朝中观察代表几时到达的通知。
    一名美国记者问蒂迈雅将军，他对李承晚扬言要与印度部队作战和劫夺战俘一事的反应如何，蒂迈雅将军说：“我们为什么要为此事烦恼呢？联军司令部曾为中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队的安全作了保证。”
