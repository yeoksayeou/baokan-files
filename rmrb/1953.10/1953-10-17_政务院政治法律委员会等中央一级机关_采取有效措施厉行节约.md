The State Council Political and Legal Affairs Committee, the State Council's People's Supervision Committee, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Justice, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives and other central-level organs are actively adopting effective measures to practice economy within their organizations. The State Council Political and Legal Affairs Committee, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Food, the Central Committee of the Youth League, and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives have all convened general meetings of all staff, with the heads of the organizations specifically mobilizing and deploying for increased production and economy.

These units have all proposed to tighten expenditures, reduce appropriations for projects that can be reduced, postponed, or are optional, and some have already formulated specific plans. The State Council Political and Legal Affairs Committee initially plans to reduce appropriations for construction projects and procurement expenses by 770 million yuan this year, accounting for 33.5 percent of the original budget; it also plans to save 260 million yuan on printing and publishing costs, accounting for 70 percent of the original budget. The State Council People's Supervision Committee plans to reduce construction costs, office equipment, and automobile procurement costs by more than 890 million yuan, accounting for over 18 percent of the committee's annual budget. The Ministry of Justice conducted a strict review of housing repair costs, which account for the largest proportion of administrative expenses, and decided to reduce them by 1 billion yuan this year; for office furniture, it decided to save more than 130 million yuan in procurement costs by repairing waste products. The Ministry of Food initially plans to save 10 percent of administrative expenses. The Central Committee of the Youth League decided to strive to save 15 billion yuan by tightening expenditures.

The State Council Political and Legal Affairs Committee, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Justice, the Central Committee of the Youth League, and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives are all preparing to streamline administrative organs and allocate cadre strength more rationally. The General Office of the Ministry of Forestry originally planned to set up two divisions, but it has now been decided not to set them up for the time being, and it has also been decided to merge the accounting and general affairs sections, as well as the housing management and reception sections, respectively, and several sections of the Secretariat will also be adjusted. The All-China Federation of Cooperatives and others have conducted specific discussions on streamlining institutions within the organization.

In order to save grain, the State Council Political and Legal Affairs Committee, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Central Committee of the Youth League, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives and others are advocating eating coarse grains. The canteen of the Ministry of Water Resources eats 20 to 30 percent coarse grains; the Ministry of Food initially requires eating 20 percent coarse grains; the Ministry of Higher Education plans to increase the proportion of coarse grains in meals by one-tenth, which can save 2,500 to 3,000 catties of refined grains by the end of the year.

The State Council Political and Legal Affairs Committee, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Food, the Central Committee of the Youth League and others, when deploying to practice economy, also put forward requirements to rectify the work of the organs and improve work efficiency. The Ministry of Food also held an exhibition on bureaucracy in late September.

    政务院政治法律委员会等中央一级机关
    采取有效措施厉行节约
    中央人民政府政务院政治法律委员会、政务院人民监察委员会、农业部、水利部、林业部、粮食部、高等教育部、卫生部、司法部和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国合作社联合总社等中央一级机关，积极采取有效措施，在机关内部厉行节约。政务院政治法律委员会、农业部、粮食部、青年团中央、全国合作总社等，都曾召开全体工作人员大会，由机关首长专门对增产节约工作作了动员布置。
    这些单位都提出要紧缩开支，削减可以削减、可以推迟或可办可不办的事业拨款，有的已制订了具体计划。政务院政法委员会初步计划今年削减修建工程拨款和购置用费七亿七千万元，占原预算的百分之三十三点五；印刷出版费，也计划节省二亿六千万元，占原预算的百分之七十。政务院人民监察委员会计划削减工程修建费、办公用具和汽车购置费八亿九千余万元，占该委员会全年预算的百分之十八强。司法部对占行政经费比重最大的房屋修缮费进行了严格的审查，决定在今年削减十亿元；办公家具，决定用修补废品等办法节省购置费一亿三千余万元。粮食部初步计划节约行政经费百分之十。青年团中央决定通过紧缩开支，争取节约经费一百五十亿元。
    政务院政法委员会、农业部、水利部、林业部、司法部、青年团中央、全国合作总社等都准备精简行政机构，更合理地配备干部力量。林业部办公厅原要设两个处，现已决定暂不设立，并决定将会计、总务两科和房屋管理、招待两科分别加以合并，秘书处有几个科也要加以调整。全国合作总社等已对在机关内部精简机构作了具体讨论。
    为了节约粮食，政务院政法委员会、水利部、林业部、粮食部、高等教育部、青年团中央、全国合作总社等都提倡吃粗粮。水利部机关食堂吃百分之二十到三十的粗粮；粮食部初步要求吃百分之二十的粗粮；高等教育部计划在伙食中增加十分之一的粗粮，到年底可节约细粮二千五百斤到三千斤。
    政务院政法委员会、农业部、粮食部、青年团中央等在布置厉行节约时，还提出要求整顿机关工作，提高工作效率。粮食部并于九月下旬举行了一次文牍主义展览。

    在增产节约运动中，武昌车辆制造厂轮轴车间全体职工把过去生产的一些不合规格的已经报废的轮轴重新改制成合乎规格的标准轴，以便装配更多的车辆。估计这一项可给国家增产节约十五亿元。这是该厂轮轴车间工人正在改制废轴为标准轴的情形。
