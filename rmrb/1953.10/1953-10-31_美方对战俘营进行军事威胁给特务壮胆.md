Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 29th. As of the 29th, the explanation work of the Korean-Chinese side has been suspended for ten days. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has still not taken effective measures to break the terrorist rule of the secret agents and allow our captured personnel to come out of the camps to listen to the explanations. However, the US side's military threats against our captured personnel, in coordination with the secret agents in the camps, have become even more rampant.

According to reports from our civilian police: At 18:40 on the 27th, a tank in the US military position two kilometers northeast of the Neutral Nations supervisory camp emitted a beam of light, drawing an arc in the sky above the camp, and the US military tank shone the light again five minutes later. At 15:28 on the 28th, a loud explosion was heard from the US military position behind Hill 155, about two kilometers northeast of the Neutral Nations supervisory camp, and smoke billowed out. At the same time, there was the sound of aircraft in the southeast direction. At 0:10 on the 29th, five red flares were fired from the hilltop in the US-controlled area near Camp A of the supervisory camp. At 2:00 on the 29th, US military tanks in the area east of Hill 155 again emitted a beam of light into the sky above the camp.

These actions by the US side are clearly a military threat to our captured personnel and are intended to embolden the secret agents. According to our captured personnel who have recently been repatriated: The Li-Jiang secret agents openly threatened the prisoners of war, saying: The supervisory camp is completely under the military control of the US military, and those who request repatriation cannot escape.

    美方对战俘营进行军事威胁给特务壮胆
    【新华社开城二十九日电】到二十九日为止，朝中方面的解释工作已停顿十天了。中立国遣返委员会仍然没有采取有效的措施来打破特务分子的恐怖统治，使我方被俘人员出营场来听取解释。但是美方配合营场内特务分子对我方被俘人员施加的军事威胁却更加猖狂了。
    据我方民政警察报告：二十七日十八时四十分，中立国看管营地东北二公里的美军阵地上的坦克射出一团灯光，在营地上空划了一道弧，五分钟以后，美军坦克又照射了一次。二十八日十五时二十八分，中立国看管营地东北约二公里的一五五高地后面的美军阵地发出巨大的爆炸声，并且冒出浓烟。同时在东南方向有飞机声音。二十九日零时十分，看管营地A营区附近美方控制区的山头上，射出了五颗红色信号弹。二十九日二时，一五五高地以东地区的美军坦克又向营地上空射出一团灯光。
    美方的这种行动，显然是对我方被俘人员进行军事威胁，和给特务分子助威壮胆。据最近遣返归来的我方被俘人员说：李、蒋特务公然恫吓战俘说：看管营地完全是在美军武力控制之下，要求遣返的人都跑不出去。
