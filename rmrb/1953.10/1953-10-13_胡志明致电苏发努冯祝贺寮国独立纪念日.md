Xinhua News Agency, October 12th: The Vietnam News Agency reported on the 12th that Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, sent a telegram to Prince Souphanouvong, Prime Minister of the Lao Resistance Government, to congratulate him on Lao Independence Day. The text of the telegram is as follows:

    On the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the declaration of independence of Laos and the establishment of the Lao Resistance Government, on behalf of the Vietnamese people, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and in my own name, I extend my sincere and warm congratulations to you, as well as to the Lao people and government.

    Under the leadership of the Lao Resistance Government, the Lao military and civilians have liberated a large part of their territory, and are consolidating national unity, and continuing their heroic struggle against the French colonialists and their puppets.

    I believe that the Lao, Vietnamese, and Khmer peoples, closely united in the alliance of the three peoples of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, will surely achieve complete victory in their just struggle against the common enemy and for freedom and independence.
