Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th—American side instructed the Li bandit special agents to continue preventing Korean People's Army prisoners of war from listening to explanations, which made this morning’s explanation work still unable to proceed.

Yesterday, because special agents coerced prisoners of war to refuse to listen to explanations, the Korean representative of the Korean-Chinese explanation delegation waited at the explanation venue for an entire day, but was unable to conduct explanations to the Korean prisoners of war in the 48th and 51st camps. The Korean-Chinese side notified the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission last night that the Korean representative will continue to conduct explanation work for the prisoners of war in the above two camps today.

At 7:55 this morning, the Korean representative arrived at the Dongchang-ri explanation venue; the special agents in the prisoner-of-war camp once again prevented prisoners of war from leaving the camp to listen to explanations.

More than 22,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war handed over by the US side to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission all eagerly desire to obtain the opportunity to freely exercise their right to repatriation. The fact that Li Ying-shan, the "battalion commander" of the 48th camp, applied to return before the explanation work began, more powerfully illustrates the strong desire of the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to return home to live a peaceful life. However, the special agent forces in the prisoner-of-war camp are attempting in every possible way to deprive the prisoners of war of exercising their right to repatriation.

The facts of yesterday and this morning show that because the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has failed to take effective measures to break the special agent control in the prisoner-of-war camp, it has created difficulties for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission itself in performing its solemn duties and making arrangements for the explanation work.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th—In the explanation work that began this afternoon, nine Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel broke through the American side's special agent's terror control and applied for repatriation, and have been sent to our side by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission tonight. Another Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel also requested repatriation, but was not repatriated due to obstruction by the American side and is now being guarded separately by the Indian custodian troops.

This morning's explanation work failed to proceed because special agents prevented prisoners of war from leaving the camp to listen to explanations. The Korean-Chinese explanation delegation accepted the request of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and agreed to change the explanation work plan submitted to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission last night. At 2:38 this afternoon, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army representative began explanation work for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel in the 33rd camp. The explanation work ended at 6 pm.

During this afternoon's explanation process, the special agents, according to the instructions of the American side, either "remained silent" and refused to listen to explanations, or made a lot of noise and disrupted the order of the explanation venue.

In the 18th explanation tent, three "prisoners of war" were arrested on the spot by the Indian custodian troops for not following the rules and attempting to use violence to obstruct the explanation work. One of them shouted loudly to the so-called American observer representative: "Didn't you want me to do this? What do you want me to do now?"

At the same time, many so-called observers, detention representatives, and translators from the American side openly violated the provisions of the "terms of reference," making gestures, glaring, nodding, and threatening the prisoners of war. Some stood in front of the prisoners of war, pointing to the door of "not applying for repatriation" with their fingers, severely threatening the prisoners of war, saying: "This is the door to go to Taiwan." Some of these "observers" so-called "mobile team" members stood outside the "applying for repatriation" door of the explanation tent with their arms akimbo, staring fiercely at the prisoners of war, threatening the prisoners of war and preventing them from coming out of this door. The American "observer representatives" even pulled car drivers wearing American military uniforms to stand in a row next to the barbed wire fence of the explanation venue, increasing the threat to the prisoners of war.

In the 29th explanation tent, a Kuomintang special agent acting as a "detention representative" pointed to the Kuomintang badge on his arm and said to the prisoners of war: "Listen to me." Before the explanation work began, many Volunteer Army captured personnel who had returned after breaking through the special agent control had already revealed that while still in the American prisoner-of-war camp, the Kuomintang special agents had already announced to the prisoners of war that they would act as "United Nations forces representatives" and come to the venue during the explanation to monitor the prisoners of war. Today's situation proves this.

In the 18th explanation tent, the so-called American observer representative pointed to a prisoner of war and said: "Go through this door!" The chairman of the subsidiary body immediately asked him to leave the meeting. A similar incident occurred in the 19th explanation tent. The chairman of the subsidiary body told a Kuomintang "translator": "There is no place for you here, shut up! Get out!" This special agent had no choice but to leave the explanation tent with a red face.

In the 25th explanation tent, although the chairman of the subsidiary body had announced that the American "observer representatives" must not make gestures to the prisoners of war, the Taiwanese special agents acting as American "observer representatives" still made gestures to threaten the prisoners of war and were stopped by the chairman. Later, another "representative" from the American side ridiculously proposed that the explanation representatives should not have two or three people explain to the prisoners of war at the same time, attempting to obstruct the explanation work. The chairman told him: "The explanation representatives have the right to decide the method of explanation themselves."

The situation during today's explanation work is the same as the day before yesterday, fully reflecting the influence of these threatening methods and the terrorist rule of the special agents on the prisoners of war. Many prisoners of war looked around in fear as soon as they entered the explanation tent, and when they saw the American "observer representatives" and "translators" present, they tremblingly shouted "Return to Taiwan!" In the 23rd explanation tent, a prisoner of war pulled down his hat to cover his face and listened quietly to the explanation. The American "translator" bent down to look at the prisoner of war's face, and the prisoner of war suddenly shouted: "Return to Taiwan!" and was forced to walk out of the explanation tent through the "not applying for repatriation" door. Many prisoners of war constantly looked out of the tent when they came into the tent to listen to the explanation, and when other prisoners of war passed by outside the door, he shouted loudly "Return to Taiwan." Some people had tears in their eyes when they shouted "Return to Taiwan." The captured personnel who returned the day before yesterday pointed out that the special agents told the prisoners of war that if they requested repatriation, they would be beaten to death on the road. They had to shout "Return to Taiwan" according to the arrangement of the special agents, and they had to make the neighboring tents hear it. Today, in the 20th explanation tent, a prisoner of war originally shouted "Return to Taiwan" loudly. After our explanation representative explained, the shouting gradually subsided, and he remained silent, quietly considering applying for repatriation. At this time, a special agent passed by the tent door and shouted loudly inside: "Return to Taiwan!" The prisoner of war in the tent suddenly responded and shouted, and then left the explanation tent.

Although our captured personnel who requested repatriation today bravely expressed their wishes, the threat of the special agents still made them very uneasy. Our explanation representative and the subsidiary body of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission assured them that no one could force them to refuse repatriation, but after they walked out of the explanation tent through the door for applying for repatriation, they still did not dare to believe their safety. A prisoner of war looked back in horror and asked: "Are there still Kuomintang special agents here? Is there still danger?" Another prisoner of war ran up the hillside hurriedly after leaving the explanation tent and went to the tent waiting for repatriation, as if special agents were chasing him.

    十七日下午我方进行解释工作后
    九名中国人民志愿军被俘人员遣返归来
    由于特务分子阻挠上午解释工作未能进行
    【新华社开城十七日电】美方指使李匪特务继续阻止朝鲜人民军战俘前来听取解释，使得今天上午的解释工作仍然未能进行。
    昨天，由于特务分子胁持战俘拒绝听取解释，朝中解释代表团朝鲜代表在解释场所等了整整一天，而未能向第四十八号和五十一号两营场的朝鲜战俘进行解释。朝中方面在昨天晚上通知中立国遣返委员会，朝鲜代表将在今天继续对上述两营场的战俘进行解释工作。
    今天早晨七时五十五分，朝鲜代表到达东场里解释场所；战俘营中的特务再次阻止战俘出营场来听取解释。
    由美方移交给中立国遣返委员会看管的二万二千多名朝中战俘都渴望获得自由行使被遣返权利的机会。四十八号营场“大队长”李应善在解释工作开始前申请遣返归来的事实更有力地说明了朝中战俘要求回家过和平生活的强烈愿望。但是，战俘营中的特务势力，竟千方百计企图剥夺战俘行使遣返的权利。
    昨天和今天上午的事实表明，由于中立国遣返委员会未能采取有效措施来打破战俘营中的特务控制局面，造成了中立国遣返委员会本身执行其庄严职责和为解释工作进行安排的困难。
    【新华社开城十七日电】在今天下午开始的解释工作中，九名中国人民志愿军被俘人员突破美方特务的恐怖控制，申请遣返，已由中立国遣返委员会在今晚送给我方。另有一名中国人民志愿军被俘人员也要求遣返，但因为美方阻挠而未能遣返，现由印度看管部队单独看管中。
    今天上午的解释工作，由于特务分子阻止战俘离开营场去听解释而未能进行。朝中解释代表团接受中立国遣返委员会的请求，同意改变昨晚送交中立国遣返委员会的解释工作计划，在今天下午二时三十八分，由中国人民志愿军代表对三十三号营场的中国人民志愿军被俘人员开始解释工作。解释工作在下午六时结束。
    在今天下午的解释过程中，特务分子按照美方的指示，有的“保持沉默”拒绝听取解释；有的大吵大闹，捣乱解释场所的秩序。
    在第十八号解释帐篷，有三个“战俘”因为不守规则，企图用暴力阻挠解释工作的进行，被印度看管部队当场拘捕，其中有一个人就向所谓的美方观察代表高声喊道：“不是你们要我这样做的吗？现在教我怎么办呢？”
    同时，许多美方的所谓观察代表、拘留方代表和翻译公然违反“职权范围”的规定，向战俘打手势，瞪眼，点头，恐吓他们。有的站在战俘面前，用手指着“未申请遣返”的门口，严厉地威胁战俘说：“这就是去台湾的门。”这些“观察代表”中的一部分所谓“机动小组”人员，两手叉着腰，站在解释帐篷“申请遣返”的门外，用凶恶的眼睛紧盯着战俘，威胁战俘不敢从这个门出来。美方“观察代表”甚至把穿着美军制服的汽车司机拉到解释场所铁丝网旁边站成一排，增加对战俘的威胁。
    在第二十九号解释帐篷，一个充作“拘留方代表”的国民党特务，指着他臂上的国民党徽号对战俘说：“听我的话。”在解释工作开始以前，许多突破特务控制归来的志愿军被俘人员早已揭露，还在美方战俘营中，国民党特务就已经向战俘们宣布将充作“联合国军代表”在解释时到场来监视战俘，今天的情形证明了这一点。
    在第十八号解释帐篷，所谓美方观察代表向一个战俘指点说：“走这个门！”附属机构主席当即要他退席。在第十九号解释帐篷也有类似的事件发生，附属机构主席告诉一个国民党“翻译”说：“这里没有你的地位，闭嘴！走出去！”这个特务只好红着脸退出解释帐篷。
    在第二十五号解释帐篷，尽管附属机构主席已宣布美方“观察代表”不得向战俘打手势，但是充作美方“观察代表”的台湾特务仍旧打手势恐吓战俘，当被主席制止。以后，美方另一个“代表”又荒谬地提出解释代表不得有两三个人同时向战俘进行解释，企图阻挠解释工作的进行，主席告诉他说：“解释代表有权自己决定解释的方法。”
    今天解释工作进行时的情形和前天一样，充分反映出美方的这些威胁手段和特务分子的恐怖统治对战俘所造成的影响。很多战俘一进解释帐篷就恐惧地东张西望，看见美方“观察代表”和“翻译”在场，便战战兢兢地喊起“回台湾！”来。第二十三号解释帐篷，有一个战俘拉下帽檐遮住脸静听解释，美方“翻译”就弯下腰来看战俘的脸，这个战俘忽然就大喊：“回台湾！”被迫着从“未申请遣返”的门走出解释帐篷。有许多战俘在进帐篷来听解释时，不断向帐篷外面张望，在门外有其他战俘经过时，他就大声地喊“回台湾”，有些人在喊“回台湾”时眼里噙着泪。前天回来的被俘人员曾指出，特务们告诉战俘，如果他们要求遣返，他们就要在路上被打死，他们必须按照特务分子所布置的喊叫“回台湾”，并且要使得邻近的帐篷能听见。今天在第二十号解释帐篷中，有一个战俘原来喊“回台湾”的声音很大，经我方解释代表解释后，这个喊声便逐渐低下来，最后一言不发，安静地考虑申请遣返。这时，有一个特务分子经过帐篷门口向里面大吼：“回台湾！”帐篷中的这个战俘也突然应声喊起来，接着离开了解释帐篷。
    今天要求遣返的我方被俘人员虽然勇敢地表示了自己的愿望。然而，特务们对他们的威胁使他们仍旧很不安。我方解释代表和中立国遣返委员会附属机构曾向他们保证没有人能强迫他们拒绝遣返，但在他们走出解释帐篷申请遣返的门以后，还不敢相信自己的安全。有一个战俘惊恐地回顾，问题：
    “这里还有国民党特务吗？还有没有危险？”另一个战俘在出了解释帐篷以后就急急忙忙地跑上小山坡，到等待遣返的帐篷里去，好像后面有特务追赶他似的。
