Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 26th: Today, another North Korean People's Army prisoner of war, Lim Young-jo, who broke through special agent control and requested repatriation, was repatriated to our side by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

    In a rest tent in Panmunjom, Lim Young-jo told Neutral Nations personnel and international journalists that the prisoners of war in Camp No. 40, where he was held, had never been informed of matters concerning prisoners of war exercising their right to repatriation due to the control of the Li bandit special agents, and therefore had no idea what the explanations were about. The people who contacted and interacted with the Indian guard troops were only special agent "battalion commanders" posing as "prisoner of war representatives." The special agents deceived and intimidated the prisoners of war, saying that this was an "international review." Lim Young-jo said that no prisoner of war dared to express even the slightest intention of returning home, and anyone deemed "not active enough" in the "demonstrations" forcibly held by the special agents would be beaten. Lim Young-jo said, "One person even had his arm broken." Lim Young-jo said that he hoped the Indian troops would quickly take measures to break the terrorist rule of the special agents so that prisoners of war could freely express their will. When asked about the reason why he risked his life to escape from the camp, he said that his desire to return to the Republic was so urgent, and the "international review" was so vague and unbelievable, that he took advantage of a slight oversight by the special agents on the afternoon of the 24th and climbed out of the barbed wire fence to escape. After the special agents discovered him, they desperately threw stones at him, but could no longer stop him from returning.

    我方被俘人员一名冲破特务阻挠昨日归来
    【新华社开城二十六日电】今天又有一名突破特务控制要求遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员林英朝由中立国遣返委员会遣返给我方。
    林英朝在板门店休息帐篷里告诉中立国人员和各国记者：他所在的第四十号营场的战俘由于李匪特务的控制，从来没有被告知过关于战俘行使遣返权利的事项，所以完全不知道解释是怎么一回事。与印度看管部队联系和接触的人只是冒充“战俘代表”的特务“大队长”。特务分子欺骗和恫吓战俘说，这是一种“国际审查”。林英朝说，没有一个战俘敢稍微表示一点回国的意愿，在特务们强迫举行的“示威游行”中有人如被认为“不积极”，便要遭到殴打。林英朝说：“有一个人就被打断了胳膊。”林英朝说：希望印度部队迅速采取措施，打破特务分子的恐怖统治，使战俘自由表达自己的意志。当谈到他冒着生命危险，逃出营场的原因时，他说，他想回到共和国的心是那样急切，而“国际审查”又是那么渺茫和不可信，因此他才在二十四日下午趁特务们稍一疏忽，就爬出铁丝网逃出来。特务们发觉以后曾拚命向他投掷石块，但再也不能阻止他回来了。
