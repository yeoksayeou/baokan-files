Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: According to a Reuters dispatch from Delhi, the Indian government is more worried about the attitude of the United States than about South Korea's threat of armed intervention. A high-ranking official said: "India had expected South Korea to behave in this way, but did not expect US Secretary of State Dulles to express doubts about the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Dulles said that he was not very satisfied with the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. We believe this statement is unfounded."

Another dispatch: A special correspondent for the Delhi "Hindustan Times" reported that a spokesman for the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the Indian government does not intend to relieve the Indian representative on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission of the chairmanship. However, the spokesman said that the Indian government takes the threat of South Korean troops attacking Indian troops very seriously. The spokesman said that if Indian troops are subjected to such an attack, the United Nations Command should bear full responsibility.

Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: TASS London, 8th dispatch: A Reuters correspondent in Delhi reported that several major Indian newspapers on the 8th severely criticized the US policy on the repatriation of prisoners of war in Korea. The "Times of India" commented on Syngman Rhee's provocations on the issue of prisoners of war, saying: "The United Nations Command and the US government have moved from tacit approval to instigating Syngman Rhee."

The "Indian Express" rebuked the arguments of US Secretary of State Dulles. Dulles had said he was "not satisfied" with the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

The "Indian Express" pointed out: "Don't think that India will pursue a policy that favors the United States."

Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: TASS Delhi, 7th dispatch: Indian newspapers with various different political views have all accused the United States of provocative acts within the Korean Demilitarized Zone.

The "National Herald" pointed out that the US military is using all means to undermine the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and the newspaper called on the United Nations to immediately discuss the Korean situation.

The "Free Press" believes that this kind of provocation in the demilitarized zone is an act of undermining peace in Korea.

The "World News" pointed out that peace can only be established in Korea if Syngman Rhee and other American agents are not allowed to carry out sabotage activities. The newspaper said that their conspiracy is not only against the Korean people, but also a provocation to the entire peace-loving world.

The "Today's News" said that it should be remembered that the Americans are serving as the Commander of the United Nations Forces. People will not be surprised by the American conspiracy to undermine the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission under the guise of the United Nations Command, as long as they recognize the US attitude towards the Korean armistice negotiations and the US obstruction of the peaceful settlement of all major international issues.

The "Indian Newspaper" of Allahabad city called on the United Nations Command to provide the Indian army with the necessary conditions so that they can carry out their tasks in a peaceful atmosphere.

    印度不满杜勒斯纵容李承晚破坏停战
    印度报纸严厉抨击美国阻挠遣返战俘的政策
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社九日讯：路透社驻德里记者报道，印度政府对于美国的态度所感到的忧虑，比对南朝鲜扬言要进行武装干涉所感到的忧虑更大。某高级人士说：“印度曾预料到南朝鲜要有类似的行为，但是没有预料到美国国务卿杜勒斯会对中立国遣返委员会的工作表示怀疑。杜勒斯说，他对中立国遣返委员会不很满意。我们认为这种说法是没有理由的。”
    又讯：德里“印度斯坦时报”特派记者报道，印度外交部发言人说，印度政府不打算使中立国遣返委员会中的印度代表解除主席的职责。但是，发言人说，印度政府十分认真地对待南朝鲜军进攻印度军队的威胁。发言人说，如果印度军队受到这样的进攻，联合国军司令部应负全部责任。
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社伦敦八日讯：路透社驻德里记者报道，印度几家大的报纸八日严厉抨击美国在朝鲜遣返战俘方面的政策。“印度时报”在评论李承晚在战俘问题上的挑衅时说：“联合国军司令部和美国政府已经从默许转而唆使李承晚了。”
  “印度快报”斥责美国国务卿杜勒斯的论调。杜勒斯曾说，他“不满意”中立国遣返委员会的工作。
  “印度快报”指出：“不要想印度会奉行偏袒美国的政策。”
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社德里七日讯：印度的具有各种不同政治见解的报纸，都指责美国在朝鲜非军事区内所进行的挑衅行为。
    “国民先驱报”指出美军正在使用一切手段破坏中立国遣返委员会的工作，该报要求联合国立即讨论朝鲜局势。
    “自由新闻”认为这种在非军事区内的挑衅是破坏朝鲜和平的行为。
   “世界报”指出，只有不准李承晚和美方其他的特务进行破坏活动，朝鲜才能建立和平。该报说，他们的阴谋不仅是反对朝鲜人民，而且也是对整个爱好和平的世界的挑衅。
    “今天报”说，应该记住：美国人在担任着联合国军司令。人们只要认识到美国对朝鲜停战谈判所持的态度，以及美国阻挠和平解决一切重要国际问题的行为，那么对于美国假借联合国军司令部名义发动破坏中立国遣返委员会的阴谋，就不会感到惊异了。
    阿拉哈巴德城的“印度报”要求联合国军方面给予印度军队以必要的条件，使他们能够在和平的气氛里执行他们的任务。
