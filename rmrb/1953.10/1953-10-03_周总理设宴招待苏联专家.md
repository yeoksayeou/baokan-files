Xinhua News Agency, October 2nd: Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the Central People's Government hosted a banquet at 7:00 PM on October 2nd to entertain Soviet experts sent by the Soviet government to assist in various aspects of China's construction.

Invited to the banquet were Soviet Ambassador to China Kuznetsov, Chief Soviet Expert Advisor Arkhipov, Deputy Chief Advisor Zhitkov, Soviet Commercial Representative Migunov, Deputy Representative Navicki, and Soviet experts working in China’s metallurgical, coal, petroleum, chemical, power plant, machinery, geological, water conservancy, agricultural, forestry, transportation, finance, trade, cooperation, cultural, educational, and other departments, both in Beijing and from various regions to attend the National Day celebrations.

Attending as hosts were Vice Premiers of the State Council Chen Yun and Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the State Planning Commission Gao Gang, Vice Chairman Li Fuchun, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Committee Peng Zhen, Secretary-General of the State Council and Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee Xi Zhongxun, and heads of various ministries and commissions.

At the beginning of the banquet, Premier Zhou delivered a speech. He said:

Dear Comrades, as we celebrate our National Day and the achievements we have made, I would like to extend, on behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and Chairman Mao Zedong himself, our warm greetings and heartfelt thanks to all Soviet expert comrades who are helping in various aspects of our country's construction.

We deeply feel that the reason why New China has been able to achieve such great success in economic recovery and transformation, and successfully launched its first Five-Year Plan for economic construction, is inseparable from the Soviet government and the Soviet people's kind care and selfless assistance. In the initial stage of our economic construction, the great Soviet government agreed to provide systematic economic and technical assistance to 141 newly built and renovated enterprises. Thanks to the Soviet Union's enormous and selfless assistance, as Comrade Mao Zedong said in his telegram to Comrade Malenkov, "The Chinese people will be able, through learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and the latest technological achievements, to gradually establish their own powerful heavy industry, which is of extreme importance to China's industrialization, its gradual transition to socialism, and the strengthening of the forces of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union." We sincerely thank the Soviet government and the Soviet people for their assistance. This historically unprecedented and enormous selfless assistance once again vividly demonstrates the further development of the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union, which has already been cemented by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance.

In order to help China's economic recovery and development, the Soviet government, in response to the Chinese government's request, sent you—outstanding Soviet expert comrades—to our country. In all departments of our country, you have imparted advanced and exquisite technical experience to Chinese comrades with a high degree of internationalist spirit, sincerity, and without reservation. You have dedicated the outstanding wisdom of the great Soviet people, demonstrating the high labor creativity of socialism and the noble qualities of selfless labor. Therefore, you have not only made outstanding contributions to our country's construction, but also profoundly educated the Chinese people. This extremely profound friendship and assistance will be unforgettable to the Chinese people. Under the strong leadership of the Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, with the enormous assistance of the Soviet Union and the continuous help of Soviet experts, the Chinese people will surely overcome the difficulties on the road of economic construction and strive with full confidence to realize the socialist industrialization of New China. At the same time, the Chinese people will continue to work hard to strengthen the close cooperation and friendly alliance between the Soviet Union and China, unite more closely with the Soviet people, and strive together for the cause of world peace.

Let us drink to the outstanding work of the Soviet expert comrades, to the increasing consolidation and development of the great and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and China, and to the health of the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government headed by Comrade Malenkov.

Soviet Ambassador to China Kuznetsov then delivered a speech. He said: On this national holiday of New China, please allow me to congratulate the Chinese people on the great achievements they have made in the cause of restoring and developing the national economy, and on the great victory they have achieved in the cause of defending peace, namely the Korean armistice. And I would like to express my gratitude for Premier Zhou's praise of the achievements made by Soviet experts in helping China's economic construction. The Soviet people will never spare their strength, now or in the future, to help the great and friendly Chinese people. The reason why all Soviet experts working in China have been able to achieve success in their work is because of the enthusiastic labor of the Chinese people, the Chinese government's constant care for Soviet experts, and the good working conditions prepared for them. This care and attention encourages Soviet experts to work hard and achieve success. He said: The Soviet people are heartily rejoiced by the great achievements of the Chinese people, just as Comrade Malenkov wrote in his congratulatory message to Chairman Mao Zedong on the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China: "The Soviet people warmly congratulate the great Chinese people on their new achievements in realizing the plan for national industrialization, in developing agriculture and improving the people's welfare, and in further consolidating their people's democratic state with all their strength." Finally, he proposed a toast to the great Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese government and its great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong.

Chief Soviet Expert Advisor Arkhipov delivered a speech. He said: The Chinese people have already achieved brilliant achievements in restoring and developing the national economy, and are now beginning to solve the task of national industrialization. Our Soviet experts have carried out the instructions of the Soviet government and come to China to help the Chinese people in their construction cause. We wish the Chinese people even greater achievements in their future economic construction endeavors. Let us drink to the prosperity and happiness of the People's Republic of China.

Chairman of the State Planning Commission Gao Gang delivered a speech. He said: The achievements we have already obtained and will obtain in economic construction are inseparable from the systematic economic and technical assistance of the Soviet government and the Soviet people, and are inseparable from the hard and selfless work of all the Soviet expert comrades who have come to China to help us in our construction. We sincerely thank the Soviet government and the Soviet people, and sincerely thank the Soviet expert comrades for their sincere help.

During the banquet, the guests frequently toasted the health of the Soviet Party and government leaders headed by Comrade Malenkov and Chairman Mao Zedong. Finally

    【新华社二日讯】中央人民政府政务院总理周恩来二日下午七时设宴招待苏联政府派来我国帮助各方面建设的苏联专家。
    应邀参加宴会的有苏联驻我国大使库兹湼佐夫、苏联专家总顾问阿尔希波夫、副总顾问日特柯夫、苏联商务代表米古诺夫、副代表那维琪，以及在京和由各地来京参加我国国庆节观礼的在我国冶金、煤炭、石油、化学、电站、机械、地质、水利、农业、林业、交通运输业及财政、贸易、合作、文化、教育等各部门工作的苏联专家。
    出席作陪的有政务院副总理陈云、黄炎培，国家计划委员会主席高岗、副主席李富春，政治法律委员会副主任彭真，政务院秘书长兼文教委员会副主任习仲勋以及各部、会的负责人等。
    宴会开始，周总理首先致词。他说：
    亲爱的同志们，当我们欢度我国国庆佳节并庆贺我们已获得的成就之际，我谨代表中国人民、中国政府和毛泽东主席本人，向为帮助我国各方面建设的全体苏联专家同志们致以亲切的慰问和衷心的感谢。
    我们深切地感到新中国所以能在经济的恢复和改造工作中获得如此巨大的成就，并胜利地开始了第一个五年经济建设计划，是和苏联政府和苏联人民的亲切的关怀和无私的援助分不开的。在我国经济建设的开始阶段，伟大的苏联政府又同意在新建和改建的一百四十一个企业中，给以系统的经济的和技术的援助。由于苏联巨大的慷慨无私的援助，正如毛泽东同志致马林科夫同志的电文中所说“中国人民将能够在学习苏联的先进经验和最新技术成就的努力之下，逐步地建立起自己的强大的重工业，这对于中国工业化、使中国逐步地过渡到社会主义和壮大以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，都具有极其重大的作用。”我们衷心地感谢苏联政府和苏联人民的援助，这种历史上空前未有的巨大无私的援助，又一次生动地表明了业已由中苏友好同盟互助条约所固定起来的中苏伟大的友谊的进一步发展。
    为了帮助我国经济的恢复和发展，苏联政府为满足中国政府请求派遣了你们——优秀的苏联专家同志们来到我国，你们在我国的各部门都以高度的国际主义精神、真心诚意地毫无保留地把先进的精湛的技术经验传授给中国同志。你们献出了伟大的苏维埃人民卓越的智慧，表现了社会主义的高度的劳动创造性和忘我劳动的崇高品质。因此，你们不但对我国的建设事业作了杰出的贡献，同时也深刻地教育了中国人民。这种极其深厚的友谊和援助将使中国人民永志不忘。中国人民在共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的坚强领导下，在苏联的巨大援助下，在苏联专家不断的帮助下，定能克服经济建设道路上的困难，满怀信心地为实现新中国的社会主义工业化而斗争。同时，中国人民必将不断地努力加强苏中两国的亲密合作和友好同盟，更紧密地和苏联人民团结一致，为世界和平事业而共同奋斗。
    为感谢苏联专家同志们的卓越工作而干杯，为祝苏中两国伟大的与牢不可破的友谊的日益巩固和发展而干杯，为祝以马林科夫同志为首的苏联共产党和政府的领袖们的健康而干杯。
    苏联驻我国大使库兹湼佐夫接着致词。他说：在新中国这个全民的节日，请允许我祝贺中国人民在恢复和发展国民经济的事业中所获得的伟大成就，和在保卫和平事业中所取得的朝鲜停战的伟大胜利。并对总理同志刚才对苏联专家在帮助中国经济建设中所获得成绩的赞扬，表示感谢。苏联人民现在和今后决不吝惜自己的力量来帮助伟大的友好的中国人民。在中国工作的全体苏联专家之所以能在工作中取得成绩，是因为中国人民的热情劳动，中国政府对苏联专家经常的关怀，并为他们准备了良好的工作条件。这种关怀和照顾，鼓舞着苏联专家努力工作，取得了成绩。他说：苏联人民衷心地为中国人民的伟大成就欢欣鼓舞，正如马林科夫同志在祝贺中华人民共和国建国四周年给毛泽东主席的贺电中所写的：“苏联人民热烈地祝贺伟大的中国人民在实现国家工业化计划、在发展农业和提高人民福利、在进一步全力巩固自己的人民民主国家的事业中获得新的成就。”他最后并提议为伟大的中国人民，中国共产党和中国政府及其伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的健康干杯。
    苏联专家总顾问阿尔希波夫致词。他说：中国人民已经在恢复和发展国民经济中取得了辉煌的成就，现在正开始解决国家工业化的任务。我们苏联专家执行了苏联政府的指示，前来中国帮助中国人民的建设事业，我们预祝中国人民在今后的经济建设事业中获得更伟大的成就。为中华人民共和国的繁荣和幸福而干杯。
    国家计划委员会高岗主席致词。他说：我们在经济建设方面已经得到的和将要得到的成就，是和苏联政府、苏联人民的有系统的经济和技术的援助分不开的，是和来中国帮助我们建设的全体苏联专家同志们辛勤忘我的工作分不开的。我们衷心地感谢苏联政府和苏联人民，衷心地感谢苏联专家同志们的真诚帮助。
    席间，宾主频频为以马林科夫同志为首的苏联党政领袖们和毛泽东主席的健康而干杯。最后，当周恩来总理提议为和平民主与社会主义的大家庭的繁荣、为苏联和中国牢不可破的友谊而干杯时，全场响起了热烈的经久不息的掌声和欢呼声。
