    People's Supervision Correspondent Liu Jun Cares About the People's Cause and Works Successfully
    A letter from the Correspondence Group of the People's Supervision Committee of the Government Administration Council: Comrade Liu Jun works in the Secretariat of the General Office of the People's Government of Jilin Province and is a people's supervision correspondent. From June to mid-August of this year, in just over two months, he reported a total of sixteen cases to the Provincial Supervision Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Provincial Supervision Committee) (accounting for a quarter of the cases reported by all people's supervision correspondents of the Provincial Supervision Committee from early March to mid-August this year). The problems he reported not only exposed illegal and undisciplined behavior and violations of regulations by certain units or individual staff members, but also saved the state a lot of expenses due to timely reporting. For example, the bricks needed for the Jilin Provincial People's Government Building project were originally decided by the Provincial Finance and Economics Committee to be transferred from Changchun. Due to the long journey and frequent loading and unloading, out of the 910,000 bricks that had been transported, 100,000 were broken or lost, resulting in a loss of 45 million yuan. Comrade Liu Jun reported this problem to the leadership. The leadership decided to change the source of the remaining bricks to the Jilin City Brick and Tile Factory, which was nearby. This saved the state nearly 200 million yuan in losses.
    The reason why Comrade Liu Jun was able to achieve results in his work is first of all because he recognized the importance of the work of the people's supervision correspondent, and secondly because he was able to discover problems in connection with his own work. For example, the case he reported of the Building Engineering Bureau's Materials Prefabrication Company not strictly adhering to the financial system was discovered when he was recently transferred to the Finance Office of the "Provincial Government Building" Construction Committee. He is able to closely connect with the people around him and discover problems through them. For example, on the morning of August 11, the Materials Section of the Construction Committee blindly hired a car to transport cement from other units at the station, wasting car fees and manpower. Comrade Liu Jun learned about this situation through comrades on the scene and reported it to the Provincial Supervision Committee at noon that day. In addition, when he discovers problems, he often brings them to the People's Supervision Correspondent Group and conducts joint research with comrades who are familiar with the situation. This shows that his work attitude is serious.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    人民监察通讯员刘浚关心人民事业工作有成绩
    政务院人民监察委员会通讯组来信：刘浚同志在吉林省人民政府办公厅秘书处工作，是人民监察通讯员。从今年六月到八月中旬两个多月中，他共向省监察委员会（以下简称省监委）反映了十六起案件（占省监委全体人民监察通讯员在今年三月初到八月中旬期间所反映案件的四分之一）。他所反映的问题，不但揭露了某些单位或个别工作人员的违法乱纪、违犯制度等事件，而且由于反映及时还给国家节省了大量的开支。例如，吉林省人民政府大楼工程需用的砖，省财政经济委员会原决定由长春调拨。由于路途远，装卸频繁，已运到的九十一万块砖中碰碎和丢失的就有十万块，损失达四千五百万元。刘浚同志向领导方面反映了这一问题。领导同志就决定改由吉林市砖瓦厂就近拨给其余的砖。这样就使国家避免了将近二亿元的损失。
    刘浚同志在工作中所以能获得成绩，首先是由于他认识了人民监察通讯员工作的重要性，其次是由于他能结合自己的业务发现问题。如他所反映的建筑工程局材料预制公司没有严格掌握财政制度的情况，就是在最近调到“省府大楼”修建委员会办公室做财务工作时发现的。他能密切联系周围的群众，通过他们来发现问题。比如修建委员会材料科在八月十一日早晨，盲目雇汽车到车站去装运了其它单位的水泥，浪费了汽车费和人工。刘浚同志通过现场的同志了解了这一情况，即在当日中午汇报给省监委。此外，他发现了问题，往往拿到人民监察通讯员小组上，和找熟悉情况的同志共同进行研究。这说明他的工作态度是认真的。
