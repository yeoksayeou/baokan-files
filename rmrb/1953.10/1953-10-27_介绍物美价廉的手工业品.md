Introducing Inexpensive and High-Quality Handicraft Products

Handicraft industry occupies a large proportion in our national economy. At present, 60 to 80 percent of the means of production and means of livelihood needed by our farmers rely on the supply of handicraft products. Improving the quality of handicraft products can not only better meet the needs of the broad masses of people, especially the farmers, but also is an effective method for the handicraft industry, which is needed for the national economy and people's livelihood, to overcome production and sales difficulties. In strengthening the propaganda of the leadership of handicraft production, the Fujian Daily has paid attention to the issue of improving the quality of handicraft products.

On September 15, the Fujian Daily respectively introduced the product exhibition held by the Fuzhou City Handicraft Production Cooperative and the technical exhibition held by the Fuzhou City Xiaoqiao District toothbrush industry, as well as their experiences. The former report shows that although the Fuzhou City Handicraft Production Cooperative has played a certain role in supporting industrial and agricultural production and meeting the needs of urban and rural people’s lives in the past, some production cooperatives have low product quality, resulting in relatively serious product backlogs and inflexible capital turnover. This has affected the development of the handicraft production cooperatives themselves and hindered the handicraft industry from playing a greater role in national construction. In order to change this situation, the Fuzhou City Cooperative Federation organized a city-wide handicraft production cooperative product exhibition from August 13 to 15. The exhibition displayed various handicraft finished products, defective products, and waste products, and used practical examples to expose the various reasons for the low quality of handicraft products. For example, the umbrella production cooperative, influenced by capitalist management ideas, added too much water to the persimmon oil applied to the umbrellas, affecting the adhesion of the umbrella ribs and umbrella paper; the glass production cooperative accepted a batch of processing orders, but because the cooperative members had a bad work attitude, they made many bad products; the brush production cooperative initially opened up product sales channels through material exchanges last year, and became complacent, producing shoddy products, which led to the loss of the sales market. At the exhibition, the production cooperatives also exchanged experiences in improving technology and improving product quality. The exhibition educated the cadres and members of each cooperative, making everyone realize the truth that "good goods travel all over the world, while bad goods can't move an inch." Everyone said that they must work hard to improve product quality, reduce and eliminate defective products and waste products, and ensure that "bad goods do not leave the door." The latter report explains that in order to help the toothbrush industry in Xiaoqiao District, Fuzhou City, improve technology, improve quality, and reduce costs, the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee Working Group led the industry to hold a technical exhibition on July 5. Participating in the exhibition were veteran workers, young workers, mobile workers, independent producers, and handicraft capitalists. Because relatively sufficient mass mobilization work was carried out before the meeting, breaking the conservative thinking of veteran workers and technicians and the blindly complacent mood of young workers, and cultivating appropriate typical examples, the meeting adopted a combination of mass performance and small group research according to each process, so that the technical research went deeper step by step, and the technical exhibition achieved very good results. Through the practical education of the exhibition, a mass atmosphere of learning technology was formed after the meeting, improving the technical level and product quality of handicraftsmen, and strengthening the unity of young workers and veteran workers, improving the relationship between masters and apprentices, employment, and labor-capital relations.

While introducing the product exhibition held by the Fuzhou City Handicraft Production Cooperative and the technical exhibition held by the Fuzhou City Xiaoqiao District toothbrush industry, the Fujian Daily also reported on the examples of the Shaxian Farm Implement Production Cooperative and the Fuzhou City Textile Production Cooperative, etc., in improving product quality and opening up product sales channels. For example, the Shaxian Farm Implement Production Cooperative was the Shaxian Farm Implement Factory before March this year. Due to poor management, the product quality was very poor, and farmers were unwilling to buy their products. This spring, it finally collapsed due to sales problems that could not be solved. Later, it was reorganized into a farm implement production cooperative. After conducting ideological education for the members and establishing product inspection and other systems on this basis, and unifying product specifications, the product quality was gradually improved and production costs were reduced. Now the farm implements produced by the cooperative are in short supply, and the farmers have responded very well. Facts have proved that improving product quality not only conforms to the interests of the majority of users, but also conforms to the interests of the handicraftsmen themselves.

In order to do a good job in peak season supply, state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives in various places are vigorously organizing local handicraft sources. Educating handicraftsmen to change the old habit of producing shoddy goods and continuously improve product quality, and supplying the people with inexpensive and high-quality production and living materials is obviously an issue worthy of our newspapers' attention.

    介绍物美价廉的手工业品
    手工业在我国国民经济中占着很大的比重。我国农民目前所需要的生产资料和生活资料，有百分之六十到八十依靠手工业产品的供应。提高手工业产品的质量，不仅可以更好地满足广大人民特别是农民的需要，而且是为国计民生所需要的手工业克服产销困难的一个有效方法。福建日报在加强对手工业生产的领导的宣传中，注意了提高手工业产品质量的问题。
    九月十五日，福建日报分别介绍了福州市手工业生产合作社举行产品观摩会和福州市小桥区牙刷业举行技术观摩会的情况和经验。前一篇报道表明，福州市的手工业生产合作社过去在支援工农业生产、满足城乡人民生活需要方面虽曾起了一定的作用，但由于有些生产合作社的产品质量不高，以致形成比较严重的产品积压、资金周转不灵的现象，既影响了手工业生产合作社本身的发展，又妨碍了手工业在国家建设中发挥更大的作用。为了改变这种情况，福州市合作总社在八月十三日到十五日组织了一次全市手工业生产合作社产品观摩会。观摩会陈列出各种各样的手工业成品、次品和废品，运用实际事例揭露了手工业产品质量不高的各种原因。如雨伞生产合作社因受资本主义经营思想的影响，在雨伞上涂的柿油掺水过多，影响伞骨和伞纸的黏合；玻璃生产合作社接受了一批加工定货，由于社员劳动态度不好，做坏了许多；毛笔生产合作社经过去年物资交流，初步打开了产品销路，就自满起来，粗制滥造，以致失去了销售市场。在观摩会上，各生产合作社还交流了改进技术、提高产品质量的经验。观摩会教育了各社的干部和社员，使大家体会到“好货走遍天下，坏货寸步难行”的道理。大家表示一定要努力提高产品质量，减少和消灭次品、废品，做到“坏货不出门”。后一篇报道说明中共福州市委工作组为帮助福州市小桥区牙刷业改进技术、提高质量、降低成本，曾在七月五日领导该业召开了一次技术观摩会。参加观摩会的有老年工人、青年工人、流动工人、独立生产者及手工业资本家。由于会前进行了比较充分的发动群众工作，打破了老年工人、技工的保守思想和青年工人的盲目自满情绪，培养了适当的典型，会上又按照各道工序采取大会表演和小组研究相结合的方法，使得技术研究步步深入，因而技术观摩会的收效很好。通过观摩会的实际教育，会后不仅形成了群众性的学习技术的空气，提高了手工业者的技术水平和产品质量，而且加强了青年工人和老年工人的团结，改善了师徒、雇佣、劳资关系。
    福建日报在介绍福州市手工业生产合作社举行产品观摩会和福州市小桥区牙刷业举行技术观摩会的同时，还报道了沙县农具生产合作社和福州市纺织生产合作社等提高产品质量、打开产品销路的事例。如沙县农具生产合作社在今年三月以前是沙县农具工厂，该厂由于经营管理不善，产品质量十分低劣，农民都不愿买他们的产品，今年春天终于因销路问题无法解决而垮台。以后改组为农具生产合作社，经过对社员进行了思想教育，又在这个基础上建立了产品检查等制度，统一了产品规格，便逐步提高了产品质量，并降低了生产成本。现在该社所产农具已供不应求，农民反映很好。事实证明：提高产品质量不仅符合广大用户的利益，而且符合手工业者自身的利益。
    为了做好旺季供应，各地国营商业和合作社正在大力组织地方手工业货源。教育手工业者改变粗制滥造的旧习惯，不断提高产品质量，供给人民物美价廉的生产和生活资料，显然是值得我们报纸注意的问题。
