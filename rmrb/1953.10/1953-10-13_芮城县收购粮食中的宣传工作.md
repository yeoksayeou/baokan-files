    Ruicheng County's Propaganda Work in Grain Procurement
    Wang Zhimu
    Ruicheng County, Shanxi Province, achieved good results by vigorously carrying out propaganda work during the wheat procurement season this year.
    In the early stages of the wheat market this year, farmers in Ruicheng County generally had serious reluctance to sell their grain. Some farmers not only did not sell their wheat but also rushed to buy and hoard it, which made it impossible to carry out the wheat procurement work, and the market situation was quite chaotic.
    At that time, the masses had various ideological concerns. Some, because they had long suffered from hunger and cold in the old society, were still afraid of famine and starvation, so they stored grain and refused to sell it. Some believed that the price of wheat would rise, so they waited for a better price before selling, and a few even rushed to buy and hoard it. Their thinking was: "This year, the government is buying wheat at 1,100 yuan per jin from the beginning, and the price of wheat will probably be even more expensive in the future." "Many places suffered from famine this spring, and the price of grain must rise in the future." At the same time, the fear of revealing wealth was also quite common. A few speculators wanted to take the opportunity to hoard large quantities of grain, waiting to make a fortune next spring. In addition, the poor management of the local grain department also increased the ideological confusion of the masses. For example, when supplying grain locally in the spring, the procedures were very troublesome, which was very inconvenient for the masses. After the new wheat came on the market, some farmers who had sold cotton, melons, fruits, and vegetables and had some money in their hands had the idea of "saving grain is better than saving money, and it will be convenient to eat and sell in the future," so not only did they not sell grain, but they also bought grain and hoarded it.
    The local Party committee and the People's Government promptly discovered these situations, and under the direct leadership of the Propaganda Department of the Ruicheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Financial and Economic Committee of the County People's Government, they focused on Chengnan Township, where the phenomenon of rushing to buy was the most serious, and carried out extensive propaganda activities through the Party's propaganda network. Through this propaganda activity, the ideological concerns of the masses were dispelled, and the masses were transformed from reluctance to sell and rushing to buy to organizing collective grain sales, achieving great results.
    At the beginning of the propaganda activities, some propagandists lacked confidence, thinking that "it is not easy to do." The Chengnan Township Party Branch of the Communist Party of China, etc., first carried out ideological mobilization work for the propagandists. After organizing the study of the propaganda outline on wheat procurement issued by the Yuncheng Local Committee of the Communist Party of China and relevant documents in the newspapers, and repeatedly and patiently explaining the policies, the propagandists consciously took active action. They organized village cadres, Party members, League members, and activists to get their ideas straight at all levels, participate in propaganda, and expand the propaganda force. Party members and League members also used their practical actions of taking the lead in selling grain to influence the masses.
    In their propaganda, they gave full play to the role of the original blackboards and loudspeakers. At the same time, they used rainy days to hold township cadre meetings, activist meetings, small-scale mass forums, etc., so that the policy of wheat procurement was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and became known to every household. Woman Feng Guilan said at the forum: "If the big river has no water, the small river will dry up. If Chairman Mao hadn't led us so well, how could we have such a good life today! It is good for the country and even better for ourselves to sell the surplus grain to the state. What's wrong with that?" On the spot, she decided to sell more than 400 jin of wheat.
    The content of the propaganda mainly explained the great significance of the state's control of grain in stabilizing prices, ensuring the supply of cities and industrial and mining areas, and supporting the country's economic construction. At the same time, ideological education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and patriotism was carried out. They invited local retired veterans of the Volunteer Army to widely publicize the heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army. The masses were very moved. For example, farmer Fan Qunhu said: "People have gone to Korea to fight against U.S. imperialism, and we should have sold our surplus grain to the state long ago!" The propagandists of Chengnan Township also guided the farmers to recall the benefits that the state's control of grain and stabilization of prices have brought to the farmers since then, and made the farmers realize the happy prospects that are unfolding before the farmers as the state begins to carry out planned economic construction. These propaganda all played a great educational role. The farmers generally regarded selling surplus grain to the state as the greatest honor.
    In order to specifically solve the ideological problems of the masses, they also carried out different propaganda targeting different ideological concerns of the masses. For example, some masses had a vague understanding of the state's price policy, so they adopted the method of comparing the old and new societies to conduct propaganda. First, they asked the masses to recall the past events in the old society when the price of wheat fell when new wheat first came on the market and the price of grain rose during the spring famine, which caused the farmers to suffer losses. Then, they explained that today the People's Government raises the price when new wheat first comes on the market and hangs the price tag all at once, which are all specific measures to protect the interests of farmers, develop agricultural production, and improve the lives of farmers. This kind of propaganda targeting specific ideas has achieved good results.
    In order to make the farmers realize the principle that there is no benefit in hoarding grain and refusing to sell it, and that selling grain to develop production is beneficial, they used real people, real things, and detailed calculations to conduct propaganda in this area. Local farmer Guo Xianyi stored wheat last year and refused to sell it. Later, the wheat became infested with insects. He was afraid of others knowing, so he did not dare to dry it. As a result, more than 300 jin of his 1,500 jin of wheat were eaten by insects. This year, the cotton fields of the Dang Shishu Agricultural Production Cooperative can harvest more than 8,000 jin of cotton. Hiring someone to gin the cotton costs the equivalent of one jin of cotton for every ten jin ginned, and each cotton gin only costs more than 3 million yuan. After calculating the details, they sold more than 3,000 jin of wheat and bought a cotton gin. According to calculations, they can earn enough money to buy two cotton gins this year alone. After the propagandists seized these examples to conduct propaganda, the farmers who originally stored grain and refused to sell it sold their grain one after another.
    At the same time, cadres of the grain and other departments also reviewed the shortcomings in their past grain supply work during the propaganda work. Later, the masses also saw that the purchasing points of the grain department and the cooperative prepared tea and set up cool sheds, and the reception was considerate, and the attitude of the cadres was also very amiable, so they were more willing to sell grain.
    After this propaganda activity, the thinking of the masses has undergone great changes, the phenomenon of rushing to buy grain has stopped, and the wheat procurement work has been carried out smoothly. Chengnan Township, led by Hehua Village, organized the collective sale of more than 13,000 jin of wheat; Hanzhang Township also organized the collective sale of 11,000 jin of wheat. The proceeds from the sale of wheat by the masses have been invested in production. According to statistics from Kong Village, Han Village, and Zhang Village alone, four large cattle and three small cattle have been bought back, and some of the masses have reported buying 6,000 jin of fertilizer. Hehua Village has purchased 815 jin of fertilizer powder. These have laid a good foundation for increasing grain production next year.

    芮城县收购粮食中的宣传工作
    王之木
    山西省芮城县在收购小麦时，大力开展宣传工作，效果很好。
    今年小麦上市初期，芮城县农民群众普遍存在着严重的惜售思想。有的农民不但不出售小麦，反而抢购囤存，以致收购小麦工作无法开展，市场情况相当混乱。
    当时群众的思想顾虑是多种多样的。有的因为在旧社会中长期忍受饥寒交迫的痛苦，至今还怕闹灾荒，怕挨饿，所以存粮不售。有的认为麦价会涨，因而待价惜售，少数人甚至抢购囤存。他们的想法是：“今年政府收麦子，一开始就一千一百元一斤，将来麦价恐怕还要贵。”“今年春天许多地方闹灾荒，今后粮价一定要涨。”同时怕露富的思想也相当普遍。个别投机牟利分子这时便想趁机大量囤积，待明年春季发大财。另外，当地粮食部门经营管理不善，也增加了群众的思想混乱。如当地春季供应粮食时，手续很麻烦，群众很感不便。新麦上市后，一些卖了棉花、瓜果、青菜，手中有些余钱的农民，就都产生了“存钱不如存粮，将来吃粜两便”的思想，因而不但不卖粮食，反而购粮囤存。
    当地党委和人民政府及时发现了这些情况，便由中共芮城县委员会宣传部和县人民政府财政经济委员会直接领导，以抢购现象最严重的城南乡为重点，通过党的宣传网，开展了广泛的宣传活动。通过这个宣传活动，打消了群众的思想顾虑，使群众由惜售、争购，转为组织集体售粮，成绩很大。
    在宣传活动刚开始的时候，有些宣传员没有信心，认为“不好搞”。中共城南乡党支部等就首先对宣传员进行了思想动员工作。经过组织学习中共运城地方委员会关于收购小麦的宣传提纲和报纸上的有关文件，并反复地、耐心地交代了政策以后，宣传员都自觉地积极行动起来。他们组织村干部、党员、团员和积极分子层层打通思想，参加宣传，扩大了宣传力量。党员、团员还用带头卖粮的实际行动来影响群众。
    他们在宣传中，充分发挥了原有黑板报、广播筒的作用。同时利用雨天，召开了乡干部会、积极分子会、小型群众座谈会等，使收购小麦的政策深入人心，做到了家喻户晓。妇女冯贵兰在座谈会上说：“大河没水小河干。不是毛主席领导得好，我们那能有今天这样好光景！咱们把多余的粮食卖给国家，对国家有好处，对自己更有好处，还有什么不可以？”当场她就决定卖出四百多斤小麦。
    宣传的内容，主要是讲清国家掌握粮食，可以稳定物价，保证城市与工矿区的供应，支援国家经济建设的重要意义。同时进行了抗美援朝、爱国主义的思想教育。他们邀请当地志愿军退休人员，广泛宣传了志愿军的英勇事迹。群众很受感动。如农民范群虎说：“人家都到朝鲜打美帝国主义去，咱们有点余粮早就该卖给国家！”城南乡的宣传员还引导农民回忆了国家掌握粮食、稳定物价以来对农民的好处，并使农民认识到由于国家开始进行有计划的经济建设以后，在农民面前正在展开的幸福的远景。这些宣传都起了很大的教育作用。农民们普遍都以出售余粮给国家作为最大的光荣。
    为了具体地解决群众的思想问题，他们还针对着群众不同的思想顾虑，进行了不同的宣传。如有些群众对国家价格政策认识不清，他们就采取新旧社会对比的方法进行宣传。先让群众回忆在旧社会新麦刚上市时麦价下跌，春荒时粮价又上涨，因而使农民吃亏的往事，然后说明今天人民政府在新麦刚上市时就提高价格，并将牌价一次挂足，这都是保护农民利益、发展农业生产、改善农民生活的具体措施。这样针对具体思想进行的宣传，收到了很好的效果。
    为了使农民认识存粮惜售没好处、售粮发展生产有好处的道理，他们用真人真事和算细账的办法进行了这方面的宣传。当地农民郭贤义去年存麦不售，后来麦子生虫，又怕别人知道，不敢晒，结果一千五百多斤小麦被虫吃了三百多斤。党世述农业生产合作社今年的棉田，共可收棉花八千余斤，找人轧花，每轧十斤要相当于一斤花钱的工资，而每辆轧花车仅三百余万元；经过算细账以后，他们卖出了三千多斤小麦，买了一辆轧花车，据计算，今年一年即可赚到买两辆轧花车的钱。宣传员们抓住这些实例进行宣传以后，原来存粮不卖的农民都纷纷出卖粮食。
    同时，粮食等部门的干部在宣传工作中也检讨了过去在粮食供应工作中的缺点。后来，群众又看到粮食部门和合作社的收购点都准备了茶水，搭好凉棚，招待周到，干部的态度也很和蔼，便更加愿意卖粮。
    经过这次宣传活动，群众思想有了很大转变，抢购粮食现象停止了，小麦收购工作顺利展开。城南乡以合花村为首，组织集体售麦一万三千余斤；韩张乡也组织集体售麦一万一千斤。群众售麦所得，都纷纷投入生产。仅据孔村、韩村、张村的统计，已买回大牛四头、小牛三头，部分群众自报购买肥料六千斤。合花村已购买肥田粉八百十五斤。这都为明年增产粮食打下了良好的基础。
