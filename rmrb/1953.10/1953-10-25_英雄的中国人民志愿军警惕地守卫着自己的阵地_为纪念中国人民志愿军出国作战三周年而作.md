The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers vigilantly guard their position
    -- Written in commemoration of the third anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the war abroad
    Li Zhimin, Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteers

As the Chinese People's Volunteers have been abroad fighting alongside the Korean People's Army to resist the aggression of American imperialism for three full years, a new situation has emerged in Korea: the struggle of the Chinese and Korean people to defend peace and resist aggression has achieved a great victory, the Korean War, which seriously threatened peace in Asia and the world, has been stopped, and the American aggressors' outrageous plan to annex the entire Korean peninsula and then invade Northeast China has been crushed. Although the American aggressors are still violently and unreasonably trying to undermine and obstruct the convening of a political conference to discuss the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and are constantly undermining the armistice agreement and stubbornly obstructing its precise implementation, the savage aggressors will continue to suffer shameful defeats.

In the great War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers have been forged into a strong armed force for defending peace. This army, which comes from the people and is educated with patriotism and internationalism, has become stronger with each battle.

The revolutionary heroism of the Chinese People's Volunteers continues to develop, morale rises higher with each battle, and fighting spirit grows stronger with each battle. Over the past three years, more than 300,000 heroes and meritorious individuals have emerged from the entire army, including many great and immortal warriors like the martyrs Yang Gensi, Huang Jiguang, Sun Zhanyuan, Qiu Shaoyun, and Luo Shengjiao; and many glorious heroes and models like Guo Zhongtian and Huang Jiafu. The first manifestation of this continuously developing revolutionary heroism is the increasing spirit of not avoiding hardship and overcoming all difficulties. Over the past three years, many unimaginable difficulties encountered by our army due to the disparity in military equipment between the enemy and ourselves have been overcome by the unwavering determination of our army's commanders and fighters. During the five battles, the troops carried heavy burdens, trekked through mountains and rivers, were exposed to snow and rain, and ate and slept in the open. Sometimes they could not eat for several days or sleep for several nights, but they still happily persisted in fighting and defeated the enemy. Later, since entering the phase of active defense, our army has used its diligent hands, simple tools, and abundant wisdom to build incomparably solid defensive fortifications on the long front. A great underground wall has been built in the mountains, preventing the enemy from advancing an inch. Especially this spring, the entire army, with a high degree of assault spirit, also built steel-like deep defense lines on the east and west coasts, making Eisenhower's planned landing adventure after taking office retreat in the face of difficulty. The troops lived in cold and damp tunnels for long periods, firmly guarding their positions, shattering countless enemy attacks, and constantly actively counterattacking the enemy to expand our army's positions. No matter how difficult and arduous the circumstances, the troops were always full of optimistic spirit, strong and firm fighting will, and intense and selfless working spirit.

The second manifestation of this continuously developing revolutionary heroism is the increasing number of heroes who are able to take on a hundred, defeat more with less, fight alone, and cleverly annihilate the enemy. In battle, it often happens that two or three people, or even one person, defend a position, repelling attacks by the enemy in platoons, companies, or even battalions. In countless defensive operations, our troops often resisted and annihilated enemies several times or even dozens of times their own size. A squad, a combat team, or an individual penetrated deep into the enemy's rear, killing and capturing a large number of enemies; one person destroying several enemy tanks, one person capturing several or even dozens of prisoners - such heroes appear frequently and continuously.

The third manifestation of the continuous development of the new heroism is the spirit of fearlessness in the face of danger and unyielding to death, which is becoming more and more prominent. In extremely urgent situations, great warriors with a high degree of awareness often emerge, sacrificing their own lives in exchange for the entire victory. In battle, some soldiers used their bodies to block enemy gun holes, covering their comrades' charges, while others lay on barbed wire, allowing their comrades to pass over them. Some people were wounded multiple times but still refused to leave the front line and persisted in fighting. The brave men did not complain in the most difficult times, nor did they flinch in the most dangerous times, encouraging each other and supporting each other. Sometimes the enemy's planes, tanks, and artillery bombarded fiercely, turning solid rock into quicksand, but they still could not shake the will of our army's brave men. Our army's position remained unmoved. In battle, some brave men's guns were broken, so they fought the enemy with bayonets; when they ran out of bullets, they used gun butts and stones to strike the enemy; others twisted together with the enemy, shouting slogans, and finally pulled the pin on grenades or demolition charges and died together with the enemy. There were also brave men who, after being seriously wounded, still sang victory songs with their last breath, encouraging their comrades to continue to advance. All these noble qualities of great selflessness and revolutionary heroism, which dare to sacrifice oneself, have created the overwhelming and incomparably powerful strength of our army, and have created our army's excellent fighting style of attacking like tigers and defending like mountains.

The characteristic of this revolutionary heroism is built on collectivist thought, on the basis of boundless hatred for the enemy and infinite love for the people. Everyone realizes that we rely on the people to defeat the enemy, and the support of the Korean people, the people of the motherland, and all peace-loving people around the world has become a force that inspires the entire army to be a hundred times more courageous and to become stronger with each battle!

Now, the equipment of the Chinese People's Volunteers is being strengthened day by day. We have built a strong artillery force and have exerted great power, giving our infantry a capable assistant. Our armored forces have also appeared on the battlefield. Our young air force has also given a powerful blow to the enemy's "air superiority," and with the strengthening of ground anti-aircraft fire, the era of enemy planes acting recklessly has passed.

With the increasing strength of our army's equipment and the increasing abundance of our army's practical experience, our army's tactical and technical level has also been improving day by day. In the frequent and intense battles of the past three years, our army has made use of all gaps and opportunities to study advanced Soviet military science, study Chairman Mao's military thought, summarize its own practical experience, and conduct military training, and has also launched a movement within our army to learn from the advanced experience of fraternal units and the experience of the Korean People's Army. Our commanders at all levels maturely apply the art of commanding joint operations of various arms, and constantly use clever tactics and skilled techniques to inflict huge casualties on the enemy at a small cost.

We still remember: in October last year, the enemy concentrated more than two divisions of infantry and a large amount of artillery and air force, launching the so-called "Kimhwa Offensive," using superior forces and firepower to attack two hilltops less than four square kilometers north of Shangganling. After more than a month of fierce fighting, the enemy lost more than 20,000 men but gained nothing. In the summer counterattack campaign launched by our army in mid-May this year, we annihilated more than 123,000 enemy troops and expanded our position area by more than 220 square kilometers. In the later stage of this campaign (mid-July), our army, in just one hour, broke through the 22-kilometer-wide frontal defensive positions held by the puppet Capital Division, the 6th Division, the 8th Division, and the 3rd Division south of Kimseong, and continued to extend into the enemy's depths. The facts of the Shangganling battle and the summer counterattack campaign this year are clear proof of the increasing strength of our army. Our army not only has the confidence to repel any enemy attack, but also has the strength to break through the enemy's firmly defended defense lines and annihilate the enemy in entire battalions and regiments. The process of the evolution of the Korean War is the process of our army becoming stronger with each battle, and also the process of the enemy becoming weaker with each battle. This is an important reason why the enemy was forced to accept the armistice.

Since the armistice was realized, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have been strictly abiding by and implementing all the provisions of the armistice agreement for the past three months. However, incidents of the US military violating the armistice agreement have continued to occur. The American aggressors continue to forcibly detain our prisoners of war, constantly undermine the explanation work for prisoners of war, and try their best to obstruct the convening of the political conference. American imperialism has signed a so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, stipulating that the United States has the right to station troops in South Korea indefinitely; and has openly declared that if the political conference does not achieve their goals within three months, they will withdraw from the political conference together; this is how American imperialism has set traps in advance for the convening of the political conference. Not only that, American imperialism still unreasonably rejects the principles proposed by our side regarding the convening of a political conference on a reasonable basis, and refuses the relevant neutral countries to participate in the political conference. American warmongers are even more arrogantly clamoring to resume the Korean War and make it not limited to Korean territory, attempting to threaten the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world. All this shows that the American imperialists, who are addicted to aggression, have not given up their aggressive ambitions. They are not reconciled to their defeat.

In the future, the Chinese People's Volunteers and their closest comrades-in-arms - the Korean People's Army - will continue to strictly abide by and implement all the provisions of the armistice agreement. At the same time, our entire army will maintain a high degree of vigilance, strictly guard our positions, and guard against all provocative conspiracies to undermine the armistice from the other side. The Chinese People's Volunteers will continue to work hard to enhance their combat power. Strengthen cultural learning, improve cultural standards, and create conditions for further mastering modern tactical and technical equipment; conscientiously summarize the experience of combat and other aspects in the past three years, strive to study Soviet military science, and strengthen military training. Only by constantly strengthening the strength of the Korean and Chinese people's armies can it be more likely to defend the Korean armistice and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The unbreakable combat friendship forged by the blood of the Chinese and Korean people is a reliable guarantee for defeating the common enemies of the Chinese and Korean people. We must do our best to continue to strengthen the unity between our army and the Korean people, and do our best to help the Korean people rebuild their peaceful life. The Korean armistice is only the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The facts of the three months since the armistice further prove that the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue will be an arduous and tortuous struggle process. The Chinese People's Volunteers will continue to be with the Korean People's Army and the Korean people, with the people of the motherland, and with the peace-loving people of the world, and will fight to the end for the full implementation of the armistice agreement and for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue! If the American aggressors and their lackeys, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, dare to violate the Korean armistice agreement and launch another war, they will surely be battered and bruised!

    英雄的中国人民志愿军警惕地守卫着自己的阵地
    ——为纪念中国人民志愿军出国作战三周年而作
    中国人民志愿军政治部主任  李志民
    当中国人民志愿军出国与朝鲜人民军并肩作战、抵抗美国帝国主义的侵略已满三周年的时候，朝鲜已经出现了一个新的局面：中、朝人民保卫和平、反抗侵略的斗争，业已取得了伟大的胜利，严重地威胁着亚洲及世界和平的朝鲜战争被制止了，美国侵略者企图吞并全朝鲜并进而侵略我国东北的狂妄计划被粉碎了。虽然，目前美国侵略者仍在狂暴无理地竭力破坏和阻挠讨论和平解决朝鲜问题的政治会议的召开，仍在不断地破坏停战协定和蛮横地阻挠停战协定的确切实施，但是，野蛮的侵略者必将继续遭到可耻的失败。
    中国人民志愿军在伟大的抗美援朝战争中，已经锻炼成为一支坚强的保卫和平的武装力量，这支来自人民并以爱国主义与国际主义精神教养起来的军队，已经越战越强了。
    中国人民志愿军的革命英雄主义精神不断发展，士气越战越高，斗志越战越强。三年来，全军中涌现了各种功臣三十多万人，其中有很多像烈士杨根思、黄继光、孙占元、邱少云、罗盛教那样伟大的不朽的战士；有许多像郭忠田、黄家富那样光辉的英雄和模范。这种革命英雄主义不断发展的表现首先是：不避艰险、克服万难的精神日益增长。三年来，我军所遇到的在敌我双方军事装备悬殊情况下形成的很多不可想像的困难，都被我军指挥员、战斗员的坚韧不拔的毅力战胜了。在五次战役当中，部队身背重负，跋山涉水，雪掩雨淋，风餐露宿，有时甚至几天吃不上饭，几夜睡不了觉，仍然愉快地坚持战斗，并战胜了敌人。而后，进入积极防御作战以来，我军更以勤劳的双手、简单的工具和丰富的智慧，在漫长的战线上构筑了无比坚固的防御工事。在丛山峻岭里筑起了一条地下长城，使敌人不能前进一步。特别是在今年春天，全军更以高度的突击精神，在东西海岸也筑成了钢铁般的纵深防线，使艾森豪威尔上台后阴谋发动的登陆冒险，也不得不知难而退。部队长时期生活在阴冷潮湿的坑道里，寸步不移地坚守着阵地，粉碎了敌人无数次的进攻，并且不断积极反击敌人，扩大我军阵地。无论在任何困难艰苦的情况下，部队始终充满了饱满的乐观情绪、刚强坚定的战斗意志和紧张忘我的工作精神。
    这种革命英雄主义精神不断发展的第二个表现是：以一当百、以少胜多、孤胆作战、机智歼敌的英雄人物越来越多。在战斗里，常常有两三个人甚至一个人坚守阵地，打退了敌人成班、成排、成连的进攻。在无数次的防御作战中，我们的部队常常抵抗与消灭数倍到数十倍于自己的敌人。一个班、一个战斗小组或一个人冲入敌人纵深，杀伤和活捉大批的敌人；一个人打毁敌人数辆坦克，一个人捉到几个甚至几十个俘虏的——这样的英雄经常不断地出现。
    新英雄主义精神不断发展的第三个表现是临危不惧、宁死不屈的精神，越来越突出，在十分紧急的情况下，常常出现以牺牲自己性命来换取整个胜利的具有高度自觉的伟大战士。在战斗里，有的战士以自己的身子堵住敌人枪眼，掩护战友冲锋，也有的战士伏在铁丝网上让战友们从自己身上过去。有的人负伤多次仍不下火线而坚持战斗。勇士们在最困难的时候不叫苦，在最危急的时候不畏缩，彼此鼓动，互相支援。有时敌人飞机、坦克、大炮的猛烈轰击，把坚石打成流砂，但是它们仍然不能动摇我军勇士的意志。我军阵地仍屹然不动。战斗中，勇士们有的枪打坏了，就和敌人拚刺刀，子弹用完了就用枪把、用石头打击敌人；也有的与敌人扭在一起，高呼口号，最后拉开手榴弹或爆破筒与敌同归于尽。还有的勇士，在自己身负重伤后，用最后一口气仍唱着胜利歌曲，鼓舞着战友继续前进。这一切伟大无私、勇于自我牺牲的革命英雄主义的高贵品质，造成了我军排山倒海无比强大的力量，造成了我军攻如猛虎、守若泰山的优良的战斗作风。
    这种革命英雄主义的特色，是建筑在集体主义思想之上的，是建筑在对敌人无比的憎恨、对人民无限的热爱的基础之上的。大家认识到我们是依靠人民战胜敌人，朝鲜人民、祖国人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的支持成为鼓舞全军勇气百倍，越战越强的力量！
    现在，中国人民志愿军的装备已在日新月异地增强着，我们已经建设起一支强大的炮兵，并已发挥了极大的威力，使我们的步兵有了一个得力的助手。我们的装甲部队也已出现在战场。我们年青的空军也给予了敌人的“空中优势”以有力的打击，加上地面高射炮火的加强，敌机肆无忌惮的时期已经成为过去了。
    随着我军装备的日益增强，随着我军实战经验的日益丰富，我军战术技术水平也已日益提高。在三年来频繁紧张的战斗中，我军利用一切空隙与机会，努力学习苏联先进的军事科学，学习毛主席的军事思想，总结自己的实战经验，利用一切空隙与机会进行军事训练，在我军内部也展开了互相学习兄弟部队先进经验的运动，学习朝鲜人民军的经验。我各级指挥员成熟地运用着诸兵种协同作战的指挥艺术，不断地以巧妙的战术和熟练的技术用小的代价给敌人以巨大的杀伤。
    我们还记得：在去年十月间，敌人曾经集中了两个多师的步兵和大量的炮兵、空军，发动了所谓
    “金化攻势”，以优势的兵力与炮火进攻我上甘岭以北不到四平方公里的两个山头，激战一个多月，敌人损兵两万多，却没有换到一点东西。而我军在今年五月中旬发动的夏季反击战役中，就歼灭了敌人十二万三千多人，扩大阵地面积二百二十多平方公里。在这次战役的后一阶段中（七月中旬），我军在一小时的时间内，就一举突破了金城以南伪首都师、第六师、第八师、第三师等四个师所据守的二十二公里宽的正面防御阵地，并继续一直伸入敌人纵深。上甘岭战役和今年夏季反击战役的事实，是我军力量的日益增长的明显证明。我军不但有信心击退敌人任何的进攻，而且有力量突破敌人牢固设防的防线，并整营整团地歼灭敌人。朝鲜战争演变的过程就是我军越战越强的过程，也就是敌人越战越弱的过程，这就是敌人被迫接受停战的重要原因。
    停战实现以后，三个月来中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一道，一直是严格地遵守并履行着停战协定的一切规定。但是，美军破坏停战协定的事件却不断发生，美国侵略者继续强迫扣留我方战俘，不断破坏对战俘的解释工作，并竭力阻挠政治会议的召开。美国帝国主义已经与李承晚匪帮签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，规定美国有权无限期留驻军队在南朝鲜；并公开声明，如果政治会议在三个月内达不到他们的目的的话，他们将一同退出政治会议；美帝国主义就是这样预先为政治会议的召开设置了陷阱。不仅如此，美帝国主义仍然无理地拒绝我方提出的关于在合理的基础上召开政治会议的原则，拒绝有关的中立国家参加政治会议。美国好战分子更狂妄地叫嚣恢复朝鲜战争并使之不限于朝鲜境内，企图威胁中、朝人民和世界人民。这一切都说明侵略成性的美帝国主义并未放弃他们的侵略野心。他们还不甘心于他们的失败。
    今后，中国人民志愿军和自己最亲密的战友——朝鲜人民军，将继续严格地遵守与履行停战协定的一切规定。同时，我全军上下，将保持高度的警惕，严守自己的阵地，慎防来自对方的一切破坏停战的挑衅阴谋。中国人民志愿军将继续不断地努力增强自己的战斗力量。加强文化学习，提高文化水平，为进一步掌握现代化的战术和技术装备创造条件；认真地总结三年来作战和其它各方面的经验，努力学习苏联军事科学，加强军事训练。只有朝、中人民军队的力量不断强大，保卫朝鲜停战和争取朝鲜问题和平解决，才越有可能。中、朝人民以鲜血结成的牢不可破的战斗友谊是战胜中、朝人民共同敌人的可靠保障。我们要尽最大的努力继续增强我军与朝鲜人民的团结，尽最大的努力来帮助朝鲜人民重建自己的和平生活。朝鲜的停战，仅仅是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。停战三个月来的事实进一步证明，和平解决朝鲜问题，将是一个艰苦的曲折的斗争过程。中国人民志愿军将继续与朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民在一起、与祖国人民在一起、与全世界爱好和平的人民在一起，为停战协定的全部实施、为朝鲜问题的和平解决而奋斗到底！假如美国侵略者及其走狗李承晚匪帮胆敢背信弃义地破坏朝鲜停战协定，再次发动战争，他们必将碰得头破血流！    （新华社）
