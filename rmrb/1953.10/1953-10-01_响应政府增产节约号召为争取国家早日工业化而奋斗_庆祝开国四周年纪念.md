    Respond to the Government's Call for Increased Production and Economy, Strive for the Early Industrialization of the Country
    ——Celebrating the Fourth Anniversary of the Founding of the Nation
    Chen Shutong, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce
    The new China has been born for four years. In the past four years, our great motherland, like the rising sun, has burst forth with boundless light and heat. Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, our country's people's democratic united front has grown stronger and more consolidated; the national economy has moved from a stage of recovery and development to a new stage of large-scale construction. In particular, the three-year great struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, in the situation of becoming stronger with each battle, has achieved brilliant victories. The Korean Armistice Agreement was finally signed. This great victory in the struggle against aggression is of extremely great significance. As Chairman Malenkov pointed out: "It proves that the unity between the people of Asian countries is unbreakable. This is a sign of a new era beginning in the East, a sign of the Asian people's determination to strive for and maintain national freedom and independence and not to allow Asia to become a hotbed of a new world war." These world-shaking and historically significant brilliant achievements have all been achieved in a short four years, making our enemies tremble with fear and our friends rejoice.
    In the past four years, under the overall national economic plan, thanks to the strong support of the People's Government, the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, and the efforts of private industrialists and businessmen themselves, our private industry and commerce have overcome various difficulties and shortcomings through various movements and reforms, especially through the education of the "Five-Anti" movement, and have moved from recovery to prosperity and development. The specific facts of the past four years have proved that only after liberation can the Chinese national bourgeoisie obtain genuine political and economic guarantees. It has proven that the People's Government has consistently adhered to Chairman Mao's instructions and the provisions of the Common Program, adopting a policy of "encouraging their enthusiasm for operation and assisting their development" for industry and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. On the other hand, private industry and commerce have also made considerable contributions to the continuous development of national construction. They have played a certain role in restoring production, expanding the exchange of goods, supplying the needs of the people, and paying taxes patriotically. They have also actively performed in supporting the great struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Patriotic overseas Chinese and industrialists and businessmen among the minority nationalities have also done their best in different regions and under different circumstances.
    These efforts and contributions of our private industrialists and businessmen are inseparable from the achievements and progress of self-education and transformation. In particular, since the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, through our own organization, we have focused on organized and planned study of the Common Program and government policies and regulations, our political awareness has been improved, we have further recognized the beautiful prospects of national construction, understood the correctness and greatness of the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and encouraged our firm confidence in loving the motherland and defending peace.
    In the past four years, the rapid transformation and development of private enterprises, and the continuous progress and improvement of the ideological understanding of private industrialists and businessmen, are all in line with the development of the new China and are completely gratifying!
    Vice Premier Chen Yun's report at the 25th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee made us clearly see that the situation in the first year of our country's Five-Year Plan is exciting. In order to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the first year of the Five-Year Plan for construction, increase national income, and accumulate funds to ensure national industrialization, state-owned enterprises across the country are enthusiastically launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy. Our private industrialists and businessmen must also respond enthusiastically, actively produce, improve operations, and contribute more to national construction.
    The state's processing orders, procurement and exclusive sales to private enterprises are part of the state's planned economy and an important step for private enterprises to obtain transformation and development. We must be responsible for doing this work well. We must overcome past phenomena such as not abiding by contracts, not delivering goods on time, or cutting corners and using inferior goods to pass off as good ones, and resolutely oppose the wrong ideas and illegal behaviors of refusing to accept processing orders and all direct or indirect, open or secret evasions of supervision by the working masses. We must abide by the principles pointed out to us by the slogans issued by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to celebrate this year's National Day. Under the leadership of the People's Government and the state-owned economy, we must strive to operate enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, abide by the Common Program, oppose cutting corners and tax evasion, accept the supervision of the working masses, actively improve business management, and gradually embark on the path of state capitalism and state planning.
    In the 1953 national budget, the amount of taxes paid by private industry and commerce accounted for 22.36 percent of the national income. This is our glorious obligation to the country. Because paying taxes according to regulations, in a certain sense, is accumulating construction funds for the country and accelerating the country's industrialization. In order to ensure national tax revenue, our industrial and commercial circles should further correct their attitude towards paying taxes and assist the government in preventing and eliminating the bad behavior of some lawless elements in industrial and commercial circles evading taxes.
      Now, what is unfolding before the Chinese people is a new stage of large-scale peaceful construction. The people of the whole country, especially the working class, are working selflessly and striving diligently, full of confidence to create greater achievements in this new stage, and striving to realize the basic tasks of the first Five-Year Plan. In order for us industrialists and businessmen to shoulder our due responsibilities in the great economic construction in the future, and in order to complete the glorious tasks entrusted to us by the country, we should guarantee: Under the brilliant light of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, we will further strengthen our study and transformation, give play to our due active role, strive to gradually embark on the path of state capitalism, and strive to realize national industrialization at an early date!

    响应政府增产节约号召为争取国家早日工业化而奋斗
    ——庆祝开国四周年纪念
    中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会主任委员  陈叔通
    新中国诞生已四周年了。四年以来，我们伟大的祖国，正如朝日东升，迸发出无限的光和热。我们的国家在毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导下，人民民主统一战线日益壮大与巩固；国民经济已由恢复与发展而进入大规模建设的新阶段。特别是三年来伟大的抗美援朝的斗争，在愈战愈强的情况下，已经取得了辉煌的胜利。朝鲜停战协定终于签字。这一反抗侵略斗争的伟大胜利是有其极重大意义的，正如马林科夫主席指出的：“证明亚洲各国人民之间的团结是牢不可破的。这是在东方开始的新纪元的标志，这是亚洲人民争取并维护民族自由和独立、不让亚洲成为新世界大战的温床的决心的标志”。这些震撼世界具有历史意义的光辉成就，都是在短短四年中获得的，使得我们的敌人已为之胆战心惊，我们的朋友则为之兴高采烈。
    四年来，我们私营工商业在国家总的经济计划下，由于人民政府的大力扶持，工人阶级及国营经济的领导，以及私营工商业者自己的努力，通过各项运动和改革，特别是通过“五反”运动的教育，战胜和克服了各种困难和缺点，由恢复而走向繁荣发展。四年来具体事实证明了：中国民族资产阶级只有在解放以后，才可能在政治上、经济上得到真正的保障。证明了人民政府对于有利于国计民生的工商业，是一贯本着毛主席的指示和共同纲领的规定，采取“鼓励其经营积极性，并扶助其发展”的方针的。另一方面，在国家建设的不断发展中，私营工商业也是有其相当贡献的。在恢复生产、扩大物资交流、供应人民需要，以及爱国纳税等方面均起了一定的作用。在支援伟大的抗美援朝斗争中，亦有积极的表现。国外爱国华侨和国内少数民族中的工商业者，也都在不同的地区，不同的环境下尽了力量。
    我们私营工商业者的这些努力与贡献，是与自我教育和改造的成就与进步是分不开的。特别是自从全国工商业联合会筹备委员会成立之后，通过我们自己的组织，着重的就共同纲领和政府的政策法令，进行了有组织、有计划的学习，政治觉悟有所提高，进一步认清了祖国建设的美好远景，体会了毛主席和中国共产党领导的正确伟大，鼓舞了热爱祖国、保卫和平的坚定信心。
    四年来，私营企业的迅速的改造和发展，私营工商业者思想认识不断的进步和提高，这都是与新中国发展形势相适应的，是完全可以欣喜的事！
    陈云副总理在中央人民政府委员会第二十五次会议上的报告，使我们清楚看到，我国实行五年计划第一年度的情况是令人兴奋的。为了保证完成与超额完成五年建设第一年度计划，增加国家收入，积累资金，以保证国家工业化。全国各地国营企业正热烈地展开增产节约运动，我们私营工商业者也必须热烈响应，积极生产，改善经营，对国家建设贡献出更多的力量。
    国家对私营企业的加工订货和收购包销，是国家计划经济内容之一，也是私营企业获得改造与发展的重要步骤，我们必须负责作好这一工作。克服过去不遵守合同，不按期交货，或偷工减料，以劣货充好货等现象，并坚决反对拒绝接受加工订货任务以及一切直接或间接公开或隐秘的逃避工人群众的监督的错误思想与不法行为。我们必须遵照中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会所发布的庆祝今年国庆节的口号所给我们指出的方针，在人民政府和国营经济的领导下，努力经营有利于国计民生的企业，遵守共同纲领，反对偷工减料和偷税漏税，接受工人群众的监督，积极改善经营管理，逐步走上国家资本主义和国家计划的轨道。
    一九五三年国家预算中，私营工商业交纳税款的数字占国家收入百分之二十二点三六，这是我们对国家光荣的义务。因为照章纳税，在一定的意义上来说，是为国家积累建设资金，加速国家的工业化。为了保证国家税收，我们工商界应进一步端正自己的纳税态度，协助政府防止和杜绝工商界中某些不法分子偷税漏税的恶劣行为。
      现在，展开在中国人民面前的，是一个大规模的和平建设的新阶段，全国人民特别是工人阶级正以忘我劳动，努力工作，满怀信心地要在这个新阶段中创造更大的成绩，为实现第一个五年计划的基本任务而奋斗。我们工商业者为了在今后伟大的经济建设中担负起应尽的责任，为了完成国家所交付我们的光荣任务，我们应该保证：在毛主席和中央人民政府光辉照耀之下，在工人阶级与国营经济的领导之下，进一步加强我们的学习与改造，发挥我们应有的积极作用，为逐步走上国家资本主义的轨道，为争取早日实现国家工业化而奋斗！
