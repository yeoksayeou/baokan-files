(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 5th) Our correspondent Wu Min reports: Hamblen, the U.S. side's leader of the repatriation group, wrote to Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC), to lodge a so-called protest against the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits" formulated by the NNRC.

In his so-called protest, Hamblen attacked the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits" as "violating" the principles of the Armistice Agreement regarding the issue of prisoners of war, but he could not offer any valid reasons to support his accusations. Hamblen's central argument is that "the intention of these rules... is not to allow them (the prisoners of war) to fully and voluntarily freely choose a solution," that is to say, the U.S. side is most concerned about the so-called "free choice" issue.

However, everyone knows that "free choice" first requires that prisoners of war have the freedom to return home and the freedom to exercise their right to be repatriated. To truly guarantee that prisoners of war have the right to freely choose regarding their repatriation, it is first necessary to remove the control of special agents over the will and person of the prisoners of war, and to end the reign of terror of U.S. special agents in the non-direct repatriation prisoner of war camps. The NNRC, in a statement issued on the 2nd, pointed out the extremely abnormal state of the prisoner of war camps, stating: "The prisoners of war were undoubtedly organized into groups during the reception work, and this form of organization is still maintained in the current prisoner of war camps. All the leading figures among the prisoners of war before being received by the Indian troops continue to exert influence over the prisoners of war, and the prisoners of war are subjected to great pressure, sometimes this pressure is violent. This is the problem facing the committee today." But Hamblen, shamelessly talking about his "free choice," avoids mentioning the dark and terrifying rule of special agents in the prisoner of war camps. From Hamblen's argument, one can draw the following logic: it seems that allowing prisoners of war to break free from the control of special agents and freely express their own will in front of neutral country representatives and explanation personnel is "coercion," while allowing U.S. special agents to deprive prisoners of war of the opportunity to listen to explanations and express their desire for repatriation, and arbitrarily persecute prisoners of war, respects the prisoners of war's right to "free choice."

People have to ask: Behind Hamblen's sophistry and self-contradictory protest, behind the accusations of so-called "violation" of the "free choice" principle, what kind of ulterior motives are hidden? Hamblen dares not say it directly. However, after the NNRC promulgated the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits," U.S. news agencies have already revealed this: the U.S. side is most afraid of the provision in the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits" for individual explanations and visits to prisoners of war. On September 30, when the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits" were announced, the Associated Press and United Press International both reported that the United Nations Command strongly opposed the "individual talks" provision in the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits." United Press International said that this provision was a "blow" to the United Nations forces, and the Associated Press said that "the United Nations Command is deeply concerned about the rules that allow individual talks with prisoners of war."

What is the U.S. side "concerned" about? What is it afraid of? The answer is self-evident. The U.S. side fears that due to individual explanations, the Kuomintang bandit gangs and the Syngman Rhee bandit gangs' special agents under U.S. command will have no room to maneuver, and that prisoners of war, freed from the surveillance of special agents, will freely express their will to return to their motherland, and that the U.S. side's painstakingly fabricated lie of prisoners of war "preferring death to repatriation" will be completely bankrupt. Therefore, the U.S. side has consistently insisted that prisoners of war should listen to explanations "in batches" under the strict control of special agents.

The U.S. side's desperate opposition to the method of individual explanations to prisoners of war precisely proves that the U.S. side has a guilty conscience and is very afraid that prisoners of war can freely express their desire to return to their motherland. The U.S. side claims that it individually consulted prisoners of war about repatriation when forcibly "screening" our prisoners of war. However, today, in a public setting with the participation of neutral country representatives and representatives of the prisoners of war's country of origin, where prisoners of war can be individually explained to and visited completely without threat, the U.S. side is panicking and raising unreasonable objections. What other explanation can there be for this behavior of the U.S. side other than further exposing the truth that it is using forced "screening" to detain a large number of prisoners of war?

Hamblen talks endlessly about the "freedom" of prisoners of war to "choose." What he demands is not the freedom of prisoners of war from the terrorist rule of special agents and the freedom to exercise their right to repatriation, but the freedom of U.S. special agents to coerce prisoners of war and prevent them from exercising their right to repatriation.

### 美方极力阻挠对战俘进行个别解释访问  证明美方害怕战俘表达要求回家的意志

    美方极力阻挠对战俘进行个别解释访问
    证明美方害怕战俘表达要求回家的意志
    【新华社开城五日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：美方反对遣返组组长汉布伦写信给中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将，就中立国遣返委员会制订的“解释和访问工作细则”提出所谓抗议。
    汉布伦在他的所谓抗议中攻击“解释和访问工作细则”“违反”停战协定中关于战俘问题的原则，但是提不出任何可以成立的理由来支持他的指责。汉布伦的中心论点是认为“这些规则的用意……不是允许他们（战俘）充分而自愿地自由选择处理办法”，也就是说，美方最关心的是所谓“自由选择”问题。
    但是，人人都知道，“自由选择”首先是要使战俘有回家的自由，有行使其被遣返的权利的自由，而要真正保障战俘在其遣返问题上有自由选择的权利，首先就必须解除特务分子对战俘的意志和人身的控制，必须终止美方特务在不直接遣返的战俘营场中的恐怖统治。中立国遣返委员会在二日发表的声明中就曾经指出战俘营中极不正常的状态，它说：“战俘在接收工作进行时无疑已分组组织好了，这种组织形式在现在的战俘营中仍旧保留着。在被印度部队接收以前战俘中间所有的领导分子现在仍继续对战俘行施影响，战俘遭受着很大的压力，有时这种压力是暴力行为。这便是本委员会今天面临的问题。”但是汉布伦在厚着脸皮大谈其“自由选择”的时候却避而不谈战俘营中暗无天日的特务统治。从汉布伦的论点可以得出这样一个逻辑：似乎让战俘摆脱特务的控制而在中立国代表和解释人员面前自由表达他自己的意志反而是“威逼”，而听任美方特务剥夺战俘听取解释和表达遣返愿望的机会并任意迫害战俘，倒是尊重了战俘“自由选择”的权利。
    人们要问：在汉布伦强词夺理而又不能自圆其说的抗议背后，在所谓“违反”“自由选择”原则的指责背后，究竟隐藏着一些什么样的不可告人的真实意图呢？汉布伦不敢直说。但是，在中立国遣返委员会制订的“解释和访问工作细则”公布以后，美方通讯社对此已有过透露：美方最害怕的就是“解释和访问工作细则”中对战俘进行个别解释与访问的规定。在公布“解释和访问工作细则”的九月三十日，美联社和合众社都报道说，联合国军司令部极力反对“解释和访问工作细则”中关于
  “个别谈话”的规定，合众社说，这一规定是对于联合国军方面的“打击”，美联社说，“联合国军司令部对于规定可以个别地和战俘谈话的规则深为忧虑”。
    美方“忧虑”些什么？害怕些什么呢？答案是不言自明的。美方唯恐由于进行个别解释，美方指挥下的国民党匪帮和李承晚匪帮的特务分子就会无用武之地，战俘就会由于摆脱了特务分子的监视而自由表达其要求回到祖国的意志，而美方费尽九牛二虎之力拚命制造的战俘“宁死不愿遣返”的骗局就会随着而彻底破产。因此美方一贯表示坚持战俘应“成批地”在特务分子的严密控制下听取解释。
    美方拚命反对对战俘进行个别解释的办法，恰好证明美方作贼心虚，十分害怕战俘能自由表达要求回到祖国的意志。美方自称在对我方战俘进行强迫“甄别”时曾经个别地征询战俘关于遣返的意见，但是，今天在有中立国代表和战俘所属国家代表参与的公开场合下，在战俘可以完全不受威胁的情况下对战俘进行个别解释，美方却恐慌万状地提出毫无道理的反对。美方的这种行径除了进一步暴露它利用强迫“甄别”以扣留大批战俘的真象以外，还能有任何其他的解释么？
    汉布伦唠叨不休地谈论战俘“选择”的“自由”，他所要求的不是战俘免于特务恐怖统治和行使遣返权利的自由，而是美方特务胁迫战俘不让其行使遣返权利的自由。
