Seize the Opportunity to Actively Prevent and Control Pine Caterpillars and Bamboo Locusts
The Operations Department of the Ministry of Forestry of the Central People's Government

Forest pests cause great harm to forests, and preventing and controlling forest pests is one of the important methods to protect forests. The most harmful forest pests are pine caterpillars and bamboo locusts. Prevention and control of these two pests is most effective in the autumn and winter seasons.

　　×　　×　　×

The trees harmed by pine caterpillars are mainly pine trees. Masson pine in the south, Dahurian larch in the northeast, and Chinese pine in the north are all targets of its harm. This pest spreads quickly after it occurs, and the damage is very serious. The pine forests in Shouchang County, Zhejiang Province, which have suffered severe pine caterpillar damage, look like withered trees without leaves from a distance, and look like they have been burned by fire up close. This pest causes huge losses to the country and forest farmers, and affects the production and life of forest farmers (for example, some farmers in the first district of Dong'an County, Hunan Province, originally planned to cut pine resin around the Qingming Festival this year to sell for money to survive the famine and buy fertilizer, but later they had no pine resin to cut because the pine forest was harmed by pine caterpillars). In addition, after the pine forest is damaged, the function of regulating the climate, preventing wind, and conserving water will be greatly reduced. Therefore, we must take eliminating pine caterpillars as an extremely important task in forest protection work.

At present, most areas in our country can only rely on manual capture, but the damage of this pest mostly occurs during the spring and summer farming seasons, so there have been cases where insect capture and production conflict. To solve this problem, we can only take advantage of the pine caterpillar's habit of going down the tree in winter to hide and overwinter, and vigorously carry out the work of eliminating overwintering pine caterpillars. Pine caterpillars are distributed in different regions, and their life habits are also different. In the Northeast region and Hebei, Shandong and other provinces, one generation occurs every year, and after October, they go down the tree and hide in the bark crevices in the lower part of the trunk or under the ground weeds, leaf litter, rocks, and rock crevices to overwinter. In the provinces south of the Yangtze River, pine caterpillars occur in two or three generations each year. In winter, some also go down the tree to overwinter, while others hide in bark crevices or curl up in groups in coniferous foliage to overwinter.

The most effective way to eliminate overwintering pine caterpillars is to tie rice straw, wheat straw, weeds, etc. around the trunk three or four feet above the ground before the pine caterpillars go down the tree in late autumn. When the pine caterpillars that go down the tree pass through the straw bundles on the trunk, they will hide in them to avoid the cold and overwinter. After all the larvae have gone down the tree and hidden in the straw bundles, the grass can be untied and captured. According to the experience of the Kunyu Forest Farm in Shandong: before bundling the grass, first scrape off a layer of the outermost layer of old bark (young trees do not need to be scraped), and then tie the slightly trimmed grass around the trunk. Pay attention to the degree of tightness when tying. The Kunyu Forest Farm achieved great results in inducing and killing pine caterpillars using this method last winter. The most insects caught in the grass bundle of one tree was more than 3,500. The farm captured more than 1,000 catties of pine caterpillars using this method last winter. The local people also think this method is very good, and they all say that one such elimination is equivalent to two eliminations next year.

Overwintering pine caterpillars can also be eliminated by searching and capturing. After October, pine caterpillars overwinter in the larval state. At this time, the activity of the insects is very weak, and the toxicity is also light. The masses can be mobilized to search and capture them in their hiding places. Farmers in Qianxi, Funing and other counties in Hebei Province used this method to eliminate overwintering pine caterpillars last winter, and the effect was very good.

Bamboo locusts are the main pests in bamboo-producing areas in our country. After bamboo locusts eat up the bamboo, they descend from the mountains in groups and harm crops such as rice, corn, and palm trees, causing extremely serious and widespread damage. Bamboo locusts lay eggs on the ground in autumn, so prevention and control in autumn and winter is very effective.

According to the experience of some locust-affected areas in preventing and controlling bamboo locusts in recent years, digging up and destroying overwintering egg masses is still the main method to eliminate bamboo locusts. Because bamboo locusts only have one generation each year, eliminating one locust egg in winter is equivalent to eliminating one bamboo locust next year. At the same time, bamboo locust egg masses are relatively concentrated, making them easy to eliminate. When digging eggs, half labor can be used, but strive for meticulousness and depth, and do not allow egg masses to be missed.

In order to do a good job in digging eggs and capturing nymphs, it is necessary to strengthen reconnaissance work and detect the egg-laying locations of bamboo locusts. In all locust-affected areas, the original reconnaissance organizations should be further strengthened; reconnaissance organizations should be established where there are none. The reconnaissance personnel should be selected from the masses or village cadres who have a certain political awareness, are familiar with the local terrain, have common sense of bamboo locust prevention and control, and can endure hardship and work hard. It is best to check for eggs around the Cold Dew solar term, in the landing area of ​​adult insects and near the bamboo forest where the bamboo shoots are damaged, and mark the range where locust eggs are found.

In addition, in autumn and winter, it is also possible to carry out the work of digging eggs and capturing nymphs to clear obstacles, seize the time, and cut down the cogongrass in the bamboo locust egg-laying area.

In recent years, most areas have made great efforts in preventing and controlling pine caterpillars and bamboo locusts, and have achieved good results. However, some cadres in the past did not have a clear understanding of the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy in private forest areas, and some situations occurred that hindered insect control work due to damage to the interests of the masses. For example, in some places in Hunan Province, because the price of pine trees is unreasonable, or the restrictions on logging private forests are too strict, farmers are unwilling to catch insects, thinking that "anyway, pine trees are not worth much, catching insects will cost labor, let them eat them to death and burn them as firewood!" There were also situations where agricultural production was not taken into account when mobilizing the masses to prevent and control bamboo locusts. For example, last year, the cadres of Dujiachong Township, Jiuyu District, Taojiang County, Hunan, blindly mobilized the masses to cut cogongrass for twenty-seven days, which delayed agricultural production, and the masses were no longer willing to actively eliminate insects. Because the broad masses were not mobilized, the phenomenon of avoiding difficulties and not universally eliminating pine caterpillars occurred in various places in the past in the elimination of pine caterpillars. For example, some forest farmers in Jinhua Prefecture, Zhejiang, only caught insects on trees on the plains when eliminating pine caterpillars, but not on trees on high mountains; Kunyu in Shandong and Matou and other forest farms in Anhui only eliminated insects in state-owned forests when eliminating pine caterpillars last year, and did not mobilize and assist the masses to eliminate insects in private forests at the same time. This greatly reduced the prevention and control effect. In the future, we should remember these lessons, conscientiously implement forestry policies, and earnestly improve our work methods.

Some areas have already created some experience in leading the masses to prevent and control forest pests. For example, Tangxi County, Zhejiang, adopted the method of mutual assistance and mutual benefit: when insect pests occur in the private forests of forest farmers in mountainous areas, if farmers in plain areas are needed to help catch insects, the farmers who help catch insects are given appropriate remuneration (such as giving the fallen dead branches to the masses in the plain areas to burn as firewood) under the principle of voluntary mountain owners. Junan County, Shandong Province, adopted the method of mutual assistance and exchanging labor to mobilize half labor to participate in insect control work, and like agricultural production, points are calculated according to the size of labor. Taojiang County, Hunan Province, adopted a reasonable division of labor system, organized labor, and reasonably divided labor according to ability, so that locust control and production are not delayed. These are good ways to solve the problem of insufficient manpower for insect control and overcome the contradiction between forestry and agriculture. All localities can create more and better methods according to their specific local conditions.

    抓紧时机积极防治松毛虫和竹蝗
    中央人民政府林业部经营司
    森林害虫对于森林的为害很大，防治森林害虫是保护森林的重要方法之一。为害最严重的森林害虫有松毛虫和竹蝗两种；对于这两种害虫，在秋冬两季防治是最有效的。
        　　×　　×　　×
    松毛虫为害的树木主要是松树。南方的马尾松、东北区的落叶松和北方的油松，都是它为害的目标。这种害虫发生后蔓延很快，并且为害十分严重。浙江寿昌县遭受松毛虫严重为害的松林，远看好像一片没有叶子的枯树，近看像被火烧过的一样。这种虫害，使国家和林农受到巨大的损失，影响林农群众的生产和生活（如湖南省东安县第一区有的农民原来预定在今年清明节前后割松脂卖钱渡荒和买肥料，后来因为松林被松毛虫所害就没有松脂可割）。此外，松林受害后，调节气候、防风、保蓄水分的作用也将大为减少。因此，我们必须把消灭松毛虫作为护林工作中极其重要的一项任务。
    目前，我国大部地区还只能以人工捕打为主，可是，这种害虫的为害多在春、夏农忙季节，因此曾发生捕虫和生产相矛盾的情况。要解决这个问题，只有利用松毛虫冬季下树潜藏越冬的习性，大力开展除治越冬松毛虫的工作。松毛虫分布区域不同，生活习性也不一样。在东北区和河北、山东等省，每年发生一代，十月后就下树藏在树干下部树皮缝隙或地面杂草、落叶层、石块下、石缝里越冬。长江以南各省的松毛虫每年发生二、三代不等，冬季有的也下树越冬，有的则藏在树皮缝隙里或成群蜷曲在针叶丛中越冬。
    除治越冬松毛虫的最有效的办法，是在秋末松毛虫将要下树以前，在距地面三、四市尺高的树干周围束上稻草、麦秸、杂草等，下树的松毛虫经过树干上的草束时就隐藏进去，避寒越冬。在全部幼虫都下树隐藏在草束里以后，就可以解草捕杀。据山东崑嵛林场的经验：在束草之前可先把最外层的老树皮刮去一层（幼树不必刮），然后用稍加整理过的草顺着树干周围缚起；缚时要注意松紧适度。崑嵛林场在去年冬季用这种方法诱杀松毛虫的效果很大，在一棵树的草束内最多的可以捕捉虫子三千五百多条。该场去冬用这种办法共捕得松毛虫一千多斤。当地群众也认为这种办法很好，都说这样除治一次，抵得明年除治两次。
    除治越冬松毛虫，还可以用搜寻捕打的办法。松毛虫在十月以后即以幼虫状态越冬。这时虫子的活动能力很弱，毒性也轻，可以发动群众在它隐藏的处所搜寻捕打。河北省迁西、抚宁等县的农民，去年冬季曾用这种办法除治越冬松毛虫，效果很好。
        ×　　×　　×
    竹蝗是我国产竹地区的主要害虫，竹蝗在吃光竹子后，又成群下山，侵害水稻、玉米、棕榈等作物，为害异常严重普遍。竹蝗秋季下地产卵，因此，利用秋冬两季防治效果很好。
    根据部分蝗灾地区几年来防治竹蝗的经验，掘毁过冬卵块，目前还是消灭竹蝗的主要办法。因为竹蝗每年只有一代，冬季消灭蝗卵一粒，即等于消灭次年竹蝗一个。同时竹蝗的卵块比较集中，便于消灭。挖卵时，可利用半劳动力，但务求细致深入，不要使卵块遗漏。
    为了做好挖卵和捕打跳蝻工作，必须加强侦查工作，侦查竹蝗产卵地点。各蝗灾地区，原有的侦查组织应进一步加强；没有侦查组织的应建立侦查组织。侦查人员以选用有一定的政治觉悟，能熟悉当地地形，具有防治竹蝗常识，并能刻苦耐劳的群众或乡村干部担任为宜。查卵最好在寒露节前后，在成虫降落地点和竹梢被害的竹林附近，进行侦查，并将查出产有蝗卵的范围，做好标记。
    此外在秋冬两季还可以进行挖卵和捕打跳蝻清除障碍的工作，抓紧时间，把竹蝗产卵地区的茅柴砍除。
        　　　×　　×　　×
    几年来，多数地区对于防治松毛虫和竹蝗作了很大的努力，并且得到好的效果。但是，有些干部过去对于私有林区的小农经济特点认识不清，发生了一些因损害群众利益而阻碍治虫工作的情况。如湖南省某些地方因松树价格不合理，或者对私有林的采伐限制过严，农民就不愿意捉虫，认为“反正松树不值钱，抓虫还要费工，让它吃死了当柴烧吧！”在发动群众防治竹蝗时，也有不照顾农业生产的情况。如湖南桃江县九区杜家冲乡干部去年在除治竹蝗时曾盲目地动员群众砍了二十七天茅柴，把农业生产耽误了，群众再也不愿积极除虫了。因为没有把广大群众发动起来，以前各地在除治松毛虫中就发生了避难就易，不普遍除治的现象。如：浙江金华专区有的林农在除治松毛虫时只捉平地树上的，不捉高山树上的；山东崑嵛和安徽马头等林场在去年除治松毛虫时只除治国有林内的，不发动和协助群众同时除治私有林内的。这样，就大大降低了防治效果。今后应该记取这些教训，认真贯彻林业政策，切实改进工作方法。
    有些地区在领导群众防治森林害虫的工作中已经创造了一些经验。如浙江汤溪县采用了互助两利的办法：山区林农的私有林发生虫害时，如需要平原地区农民帮助捉虫，在山主自愿的原则下，给帮助捉虫的农民以适当报酬（如以打下的枯枝给平原地区群众作柴烧）。山东莒南县采用互助变工的办法，动员半劳力参加治虫工作，和农业生产一样按劳力大小计分。湖南桃江县采取合理分工制，把劳力组织起来，按能力合理分工，使治蝗和生产两不误。这都是解决治虫人力不足的问题、克服林业和农业的矛盾的好办法。各地可以根据当地具体情况，创造出更多更好的办法来。
