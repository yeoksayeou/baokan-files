(Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 27th) According to a TASS report from Paris: On October 25th, a rally of approximately 30,000 people was held in Paris to oppose the Bonn and Paris military treaties, to oppose the establishment of a "European Army," and to demand a peaceful resolution of international disputes.

    The presidium of the conference consisted of the following: Mrs. Gordon, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation; Dastier de la Vigerie, member of the National Assembly and member of the Progressive Republican Alliance; Raymond Guyot, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party; Germaine Guille, Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor; renowned writer Louis Aragon; Pastor Bosk; and other representatives of outstanding scientists, actors, artists, and French democrats.

    Jacques Pogue, a member of the United Association of War Invalids of the Resistance Movement, Georges Guingouin, member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, and others who spoke pointed out that the fundamental purpose of the Bonn and Paris military treaties is to rearm West Germany in order to launch another aggression against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. They emphasized that the resurrected German militarism seriously threatens the survival of France. They demanded that the people oppose the ratification of the Bonn and Paris military treaties by the French Parliament.

    The conference read out a letter from former French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier. Daladier pointed out: "Under the pretext of establishing a defense organization, the draft 'European Defense Community' agreement is rearming Germany and preparing for the appearance of Nazi generals and SS men in European military uniforms." Daladier said: "For three years, I have been opposing this dangerous plan; I will oppose it to the end, because it breeds the seeds of a third world war. Naturally, others also oppose this plan. Regardless of their party affiliation or religious beliefs, I stand with them to stop something that could cause eternal regret. Now is the time, because the various pressures have become increasingly rude and shameless. Let our whole country stand together to oppose the rearmament of West Germany and strive for peaceful coexistence among all countries—as long as they fight for peace. Our task is arduous, but as long as we are united and determined, we can achieve the unconditional cancellation of this plan, which is equally dangerous to peace and to our country."

    Letters from Edmond Michelet and Léo Hamon, members of the Council of the Republic, were also read at the meeting.

    Mass rallies have also been held in Marseille, Saint-Étienne, Grenoble, Lens, and other parts of France to oppose the "European Army" and strive for a peaceful resolution of international disputes.

    (Xinhua News Agency, 27th) According to the October 16th issue of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!", the French Communist Party has recently won successive victories in elections. In mid-October, a Communist candidate won a seat as a councilor in the Yonne department in a by-election. He received more than twice as many votes as in the 1951 election. In the rural areas of the Pont-sur-Yonne constituency in this department, the number of votes for the French Communist Party increased two or three times. In addition, two Communist candidates were elected municipal councilors in the towns of Aiguillon and Barbaste in the Lot-et-Garonne department.

    巴黎三万人举行大会反对波恩和巴黎条约
    法国共产党最近在选举中接连获得胜利
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：十月二十五日，巴黎举行了约三万人的大会，反对波恩与巴黎军事条约，反对成立“欧洲军”，要求和平解决国际纠纷。
    大会主席团由下面许多人组成：国际民主妇女联合会主席戈登夫人，国民议会议员、进步共和联盟盟员达斯迪埃·德拉维热里，法国共产党中央委员会政治局委员雷蒙·葛约，总工会书记歇曼娜·葛叶，名作家路易·阿拉贡，波斯克牧师以及卓越的科学家、演员、艺术家和法国民主分子的其他代表。
    抵抗运动战争残废者联合会会员雅克·波格、法国共产党中央委员会委员乔治·谷尼欧及其他演说的人都指出：波恩与巴黎军事条约的基本目的是重新武装西德，以便向苏联和人民民主国家再度发动侵略。他们强调指出：复活起来的德国军国主义严重威胁着法国的生存。他们要求人民反对法国议会批准波恩与巴黎军事条约。
    大会宣读了前法国内阁总理爱德华·达拉第的来信。达拉第指出：“在建立一个防务组织的藉口下，‘欧洲防务集团’协定草案正在使德国重新武装起来，并且为纳粹将领和党卫军穿着欧洲军制服出现作好准备。”达拉第说：“三年来，我一直在反对这种危险的计划；我还要反对到底，因为它孕育着第三次世界大战的种子。自然，其他的人也反对这个计划。不管他们属于甚么党派，他们的宗教信仰如何，我都和他们站在一起，制止那种一失足便成千古恨的事情，现在是时候了，因为各种压力已经变得越来越粗暴、越来越无耻了。让我们全国的人都站在一起，来反对重新武装西德，争取所有国家——只要它们为和平而奋斗——和平共处。我们的任务是艰巨的，但是只要我们一致，只要我们有决心，我们就可以达到无条件取消这个对和平以及对我国同样危险的计划。”
    会上还宣读了共和国参议院议员埃德蒙·密歇勒和利奥·阿蒙的来信。
    马赛、圣亚田、格累诺布尔、隆斯及法国其他地方都举行了群众大会，反对“欧洲军”，争取和平解决国际纠纷。
    【新华社二十七日讯】据十月十六日出版的“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”报道，法国共产党最近在选举中接连赢得了胜利。十月中旬，共产党的一个候选人在补缺选举中赢得了犹勒省省议会议员的席位。他获得的选票比一九五一年选举时多了一倍以上。在这个省的彭—奥德麦选区的乡村里，法国共产党的票数增加了两、三倍。此外，在罗特—加隆省的艾吉翁市和巴尔巴斯特市，也有两个共产党候选人当选市政委员。
