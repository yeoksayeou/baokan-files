    Ikeda Masanosuke's Talk

    This time, we are visiting Beijing as representatives of the Japanese "Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade." This visit to your country is based on the friendly and peaceful spirit of the Chinese people. We are sincerely delighted to be able to personally experience the construction of New China in all its aspects, to have the opportunity to talk to each other, and to deepen our mutual understanding and friendship.

    Today, we are signing a trade agreement here. Although there will be many difficulties in its implementation in the future, we are determined to cooperate and work together with the Japanese industrial and trade circles, as well as the Japanese people, to make it a reality. Moreover, after returning to our country, we will definitely make every effort to welcome the delegation of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to Japan as soon as possible and make it a reality.

    This time, we were able to meet with Mr. Nan Hanchen of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and responsible gentlemen from all aspects of trade, and we also had the opportunity to discuss and exchange specific views on practical trade issues. We are convinced that this is of historical significance in promoting future trade.

    In particular, the future relationship between Japan and China is built on the principles of peace, friendship, equality, and mutual benefit. We fully agree with this spirit.

    Based on this spirit, we have enriched and developed the Japan-China trade agreement concluded in 1952 and made it more practical. In this sense, we have now signed a new Japan-China trade agreement. I believe that this is not only for the economic construction and improvement of people's livelihood in both China and Japan, but also a big step forward for the peaceful and friendly relations between the two countries, which is worth celebrating. I would like to express my deep gratitude to all the gentlemen who have worked hard to conclude this agreement.

    Finally, on behalf of all the members of our delegation, I would like to express our deep gratitude and respect for the thoughtful hospitality we received in Beijing for a month, as well as for the visits we made to various places to see the construction of New China and the Chinese people's ardent hope for world peace and their efforts for peace.

    On the occasion of the conclusion of this new agreement, I would like to express my feelings as a speech. (Xinhua News Agency)

    池田正之辅的谈话
    这次，我们代表日本“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”来访问北京。这次访问贵国，就是根据了中国人民的友好与和平的基本精神。我们能够亲身接触到新中国各方面的建设，能够有相互交谈的机会，能够加深我们相互的理解和友好，我们感到衷心的欣幸。
    今天，在此签订贸易协议，虽然今后在执行上还有着很多困难，但我们决心和日本产业界、贸易界以及日本国民共同合作努力使其实现。而且我们回国之后，一定为着早日迎接中国人民政治协商会议代表团到达日本，尽所有的努力使其早日实现。
    这次，我们能和中国国际贸易促进委员会南汉宸先生以及有关贸易各方面的负责先生们见面，而且对于贸易上的实际交易问题，也有了商谈和交换具体意见的机会，我们确信，在促进今后贸易这点上，是有着历史性的意义的。
    特别是今后日中两国的关系是建筑在和平友好与平等互利的原则上，这个精神，也是我们所完全同意的。
    我们本着这个精神，在一九五二年缔结的中日贸易协议的基础上，使其充实发展，并使其更为实际，在这样意义上，我们兹签订了新的中日贸易协议，我相信这不仅是对于中日两国经济建设和改善民生，而且对于两国和平友好的关系，也前进了一大步，这是值得庆贺的。我在这里对为缔结本协议而努力的各位先生致以深切的感谢。
    最后，我们代表团全体团员，在北京的一个月里受到了周到的招待，同时又到各方面去参观，看到了新中国的建设和中国人民对世界和平的热烈希望以及为和平而尽的努力。对此我们深表感激和敬意。
    当此缔结新协议之际，仅叙述一下我的感想做为致辞。    （新华社）
