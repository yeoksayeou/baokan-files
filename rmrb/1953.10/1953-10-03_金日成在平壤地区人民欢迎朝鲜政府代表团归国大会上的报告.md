Comrades!

Our government delegation's visit to the great Soviet Union was met with a warm welcome from the fraternal Soviet people. Under the deep care and concern of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, we successfully completed the mission entrusted to us by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a short period of time and in a fully harmonious atmosphere, and returned to our homeland.

As pointed out in the already published communiqué on the talks between the government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Soviet government, the main issues discussed during the Moscow talks between the two governments were further consolidation and development of the fraternal friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issues related to the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, the use of the 1 billion rubles of aid provided by the Soviet government for the rapid restoration and construction of our war-torn people's economy, and the repayment of loans granted to our republic by the Soviet Union in the past few years.

The Soviet government vigorously resolved these issues, which are of utmost importance to the future development of our country, to conform to our current economic and political situation and the interests of our people. During the talks, both sides reached a full understanding, believing that the friendly cooperative relations already established between the two countries fully conform to the interests of the peoples of both countries and are conducive to safeguarding and ensuring peace and security in the Far East.

The two sides reached a consensus that the armistice in Korea has created a condition for achieving the unification of the Korean nation by peaceful means, that is, achieving a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue based on giving the Korean people the opportunity to resolve the issue of the Korean state structure themselves.

During the talks, regarding the particularly concerning issue of economic assistance, namely the use of the 1 billion rubles allocated by the Soviet government to our people, who suffered many sacrifices and losses during the Fatherland Liberation War, for the purpose of restoring and developing the post-war people's economy, the following agreement was reached: First, it will be used to restore and construct some factories that serve as the foundation of our people's economy. The factories to be restored are: Kim Chaek Ironworks, Chongjin Steel Mill, Hungnam Fertilizer Factory, Nampo Smelter, Sunghori Cement Factory, Supung Power Plant, Pyongyang Textile Factory; the factories to be newly built are: Silk Weaving Factory, Meat Processing Complex, Fish Cannery, Hydrochloric Acid Factory, Dyeing Factory, Bleaching Factory, Tractor Repair Factory, Central Radio Broadcasting Station.

The specific ways in which the Soviet Union is taking to restore and build these factories are: the Soviet Union will provide the equipment and materials for the factories, provide technical assistance in the process of restoring and building the factories, provide us with licenses and technical documents for organizing product production, and train our national cadres to work in these enterprises. Not only that, but the Soviet Union will also supply us with the equipment and materials needed for factory restoration work that we can carry out on our own, according to our needs, and at the same time supply agricultural machinery, farm implements, chemical fertilizers, breeding livestock, horses, fishing boats, buses, daily necessities, and equipment and materials for hospitals and schools, etc., to develop the rural economy and improve the people's living standards.

In view of the huge investment required for our country to practically restore the important and urgent task of the people's economy, the Soviet government not only postponed the start of repayment of loans granted to our country by the Soviet government over the years for several years, but also made the repayment conditions even more favorable. Thanks to this multifaceted and selfless assistance from the Soviet government, the restoration and development of our people's economy has been materially guaranteed, and in the shortest possible time it will be restored to the pre-war level, and many enterprises in all sectors of our national economy, especially in the heavy industry sector, will be even larger than before the war, and many new factories that did not exist before the war will appear in the light and food industries.

If we add the factories and equipment that the People's Republic of China and the fraternal people's democratic countries – Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, and other countries – have agreed to help us build, we can imagine the scale to which our people's economy will expand in the next two or three years.

This not only means exceeding the scale of our people's economy before the war in quantity, but also means that we have a prospect that will actually bring about fundamental and qualitative changes to our national economy, correct the colonial biases that have long existed in our industrial sectors, and enable our country to develop into an independent industrial country.

The people's economy in our industrial, transport, postal, agricultural, and fishery sectors will be restored and constructed not on the backward technical basis left by Japanese imperialism, but on the basis of modern, cutting-edge technology.

Important parts of our national economy will be equipped with modern, cutting-edge technology and develop to a higher stage, which will become a solid material foundation for the comprehensive industrialization of our country in the future. Moreover, according to this assistance from the Soviet government, the factories that we must restore and rebuild also include factories for daily necessities and food factories that are used to improve the people's material life. The main significance is that we Koreans, who are still unable to produce our own important daily necessities and food, will be able to solve this problem with our own hands in the near future.

Therefore, we will vigorously carry out the production of cotton and silk fabrics, one of the products for which raw materials can be solved in Korea.

The vast majority of our population is farmers engaged in agricultural production. Therefore, the rapid restoration of the post-war rural economy is one of the important economic tasks of our people.

The key issues to be emphasized in developing the rural economy are: to supply many livestock, tractors and fertilizers to ensure the production of farmers, and to pay attention to the rapid restoration of irrigation facilities.

The results of the talks in Moscow this time enabled our agriculture to obtain many livestock and tractors from the Soviet Union, and to build tractor repair factories and restore fertilizer factories. This has solved the urgent problems we face in developing the rural economy.

Our universities and laboratories and libraries in scientific departments were completely destroyed during the war. We can also get Soviet assistance in restoring the various laboratories and libraries that are urgently needed for our many scientific cadres and university students to study science.

The above are the results of the talks between our government delegation and the Soviet government in Moscow this time.

The results of these talks between the governments of Korea and the Soviet Union have great political significance. This result will further develop and strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries of Korea and the Soviet Union to a new stage; moreover, it has taken an important step in the great cause of peacefully resolving the Korean issue and maintaining and safeguarding peace and security in the Far East and the world.

Therefore, the peace-loving people of the world, together with the people of Korea and the Soviet Union, welcome the results of this meeting with great satisfaction, and believe that it has made a great contribution to the common cause of the peace, democracy and socialist camp. This is only natural.

However, the US ruling clique, ignoring the expectations and demands of the peace-loving people of the world, is taking a stand that runs counter to maintaining and safeguarding peace and security in Asia and the world.

Now, the attitude adopted by the US ruling clique on the working procedures and membership of the political conference to be convened in accordance with the terms of the Korean Armistice Agreement has been sharply criticized by the peace-loving camp around the world. This attitude of the US ruling clique shows that they are unwilling to stabilize the armistice achieved in Korea and peacefully resolve the Korean issue once and for all.

However, we will adhere to our position of safeguarding our national interests and ensuring peace and security in the Far East, and we will never retreat a step from this position, and we will continue to carry out a firm struggle to ensure that the Korean people resolve the Korean issue themselves without foreign interference and to achieve the peaceful unification and independence of our motherland.

Compatriots! I believe that the huge assistance given to us by the Soviet Union and the assistance given to us by the fraternal people's democratic countries have created all the material and technical conditions for us to accelerate the restoration and construction of our post-war people's economy.

The remaining question is whether we Korean people can correctly utilize this assistance.

We are a people who have been tempered by the three-year Fatherland Liberation War and have the strength to fight.

All of us Korean people must not relax the mobilized and tense state of the war period, but must unite around the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government as one, and rise up together to participate in the post-war restoration and construction of the people's economy.

We must formulate a three-year people's economic plan in the short term, and do all the preparatory work and mobilization work to implement it from 1954.

Now, we must vigorously carry out the current year's autumn harvest work and the preparation work for next year's spring plowing and sowing, and at the same time, we must strive to do a good job in this year's winter preparation work.

We must start up as many machines as possible that can produce; we must fight to quickly build building materials factories and start supplying basic construction projects with materials in the short term; we must widely carry out the production of daily necessities urgently needed by the people's lives; other departments must vigorously carry out winter preparations and work to ensure that next year's production is not damaged.

We must mobilize all domestic resources, correctly organize and use labor, improve specialized technology in economic departments, widely carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy as an element to solve economic construction funds, and launch a mass mutual assistance movement to stabilize the people's lives.

During the war, we defended our motherland with our blood and death. Today, we must quickly restore the wounds suffered by our motherland due to the war with our glorious efforts.

It is the glorious task of each of our citizens today to dedicate themselves to repaying our motherland and people with glorious efforts.

We must fully invest the valuable experience gained in the flames of war and the unprecedented spirit of patriotism and heroism that has been brought into play in the post-war restoration and the struggle to achieve the peaceful unification and independence of our country.

I am confident that as long as we Korean people unite as one to fight for the restoration of the post-war people's economy, and with the assistance of China and the people's democratic countries led by the Soviet Union, we will surely overcome the difficulties before us and achieve victory in the cause of restoring the post-war people's economy.

Dear comrades! The results of these talks between Korea and the Soviet Union once again prove to the world that the bastion of world peace and security – the great Soviet Union – is not only the liberator of our people, but also our true helper and close friend.

Thanks to the selfless and active assistance of the Soviet Union, Korea established a people's government with its own hands after liberation and implemented various democratic reforms. The economic and cultural mutual assistance agreement signed with the Soviet Union in 1949 marked an important stage in the development of our country. During our Fatherland Liberation War against the armed aggressors of US imperialism and its running dog, the traitorous Lee Seung-man bandit gang, the Soviet Union encouraged and encouraged the Korean people to move towards victory with its active support and solidarity. Today, with the armistice already achieved, the Soviet Union, in order to restore our destroyed people's economy as soon as possible, has once again issued a call to help our people, allocating a huge amount of restoration aid funds for us and starting to put it into practice.

The solid friendship formed by the people of Korea and the Soviet Union through liberation and assistance not only conforms to the interests of both countries, but also benefits the entire peace, democracy and socialist camp.

We will strive to strengthen this noble friendship between the people of Korea and the Soviet Union, and will never allow anyone to weaken this friendship.

Only by further strengthening the fraternal friendship and relations with the people of the People's Republic of China and the people of all people's democratic countries headed by the great Soviet people can we achieve results and victory in the post-war restoration of our people's economy and in the struggle for the peaceful unification and independence of our country, just as we achieved victory in the war.

I am confident that all the Korean people will hold high the banner of internationalism, and for the prosperity of our nation, for the construction of a strong, democratic, unified and independent country, will unite as one to rise up and carry out the historical mission of the entire nation.

Long live the eternal friendship and unity between the great Soviet people and the Korean people!

Long live our glorious motherland – the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

### 金日成在平壤地区人民欢迎朝鲜政府代表团归国大会上的报告

    金日成在平壤地区人民欢迎朝鲜政府代表团归国大会上的报告亲爱的同志们！
    我们政府代表团这次访问伟大的苏联，受到兄弟般的苏联人民的热烈欢迎。在苏联共产党和苏联政府的深切照顾和关怀下，在充分和谐的气氛中，以短短的时间，成功地完成了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府委托给我们的使命，返回祖国了。
    就像业已发表的关于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团与苏联政府会谈的公报所指明的一样，这次朝苏两国政府在莫斯科会谈的主要问题，是进一步巩固和发展苏联与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国之间的兄弟般的友好关系问题以及与和平解决朝鲜问题有关的问题，关于怎样使用苏联政府为迅速恢复建设我们遭受战争破坏的人民经济而拨给的十亿卢布的援助金的问题以及偿付苏联在过去几年中贷予我们共和国的贷款的问题。
    对于这些与我国未来的发展极关重要的问题，苏联政府都大力予以解决，使符合我国目前的经济政治形势和我们人民的利益。在会谈过程中，双方获致充分谅解，认为：朝苏两国之间已经建立的友好合作关系，首先是完全符合于朝苏两国人民的利益并有利于维护和保障远东和平与安全事业的。
    双方达到了一致的意见，认为朝鲜停战的达成，创造了一种条件，能以和平的方法达成朝鲜民族的统一，即在给朝鲜人民以自己解决朝鲜国家结构问题的机会的基础上，达成朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    在会谈过程中，关于受到特别关心的经济援助问题，即使用苏联政府拨给在祖国解放战争过程中遭受很多牺牲和损失的我国人民作为恢复和发展战后人民经济之用的十亿卢布的问题，获致如下的协议：首先将用于恢复建设作为我国人民经济基础的一些工厂。要恢复的工厂是：金策制铁所、清津炼钢厂、兴南肥料工厂、南浦冶炼厂、胜湖里水泥工厂、水丰发电厂、平壤纺织工厂；要新建的工厂是：绢织工厂、肉类综合工厂、鱼类罐头工厂、盐酸工厂、染色工厂、漂白工厂、拖拉机修理工厂、中央无线电放送局。
    苏联所采取的恢复和建设这些工厂的具体方式是：由苏联提供工厂的设备和器材，在工厂的恢复和建设过程中给予技术上帮助，提供给我们为组织产品生产的特许证及技术文件，并培养在这些企业里工作的我们民族干部。不但如此，苏联并按照我们的要求，供给我们以自己力量能够进行的工厂恢复工作所需要的设备和器材，同时供给作为发展农村经济和提高人民生活的农业机器、农具、化学肥料、种畜、马匹、渔船、公共汽车、生活必需品和医院、学校等的设备和器材。
    苏联政府鉴于我国在实践恢复人民经济的重要而迫切的任务时所需要的巨大投资，不仅把多年来苏联政府贷予我国的贷款的开始偿付期限延期数年，而且把偿付条件订得更加优惠。由于苏联政府这种多方面的无私援助，我国人民经济的恢复和发展得到了物质的保证，今后将在最短期间内恢复到战前的水平，在我们民族经济的各部门，特别是在重工业部门中并且将有许多企业比战前更加扩大，在轻工业及食品工业方面将出现许多战前所没有的新工厂。
    如果再加上中华人民共和国和兄弟般的各人民民主国家——捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、匈牙利及其他国家已约定帮助我们建设的工厂和设备，我们就可以想见我国人民经济在今后两三年间将扩大到怎样的规模。
    这不但意味着在数量上超过战前我国人民经济的规模，而且意味着我们具有了在实际上给我们民族经济带来根本性的和质的变化的展望，纠正长期存在于我国工业部门的殖民地的偏颇性，使我国能够发展成为独立的工业国。
    我们工业、运输、递信、农业、渔业等各部门的人民经济，将不是在日本帝国主义留下的那种落后的技术基础上，而是在现代的最新技术的基础上进行恢复和建设。
    我们民族经济的重要部分将以现代的最新技术装备起来，向更高的阶段发展，它将成为我国今后全面工业化的巩固的物质基础。不但如此，按照苏联政府这次的援助，在我们一定要恢复新建的工厂中还包括着用来提高人民物质生活的生活必需品工厂和食品工厂。其主要的意义在于：尚不能生产自己的重要生活必需品和食品的我们朝鲜人，在不久的将来就可以用自己的手来解决这个问题了。
    因此，我们将大力进行在朝鲜能够解决原料问题的产品之一——棉花和绢织物的生产。
    我国绝大多数的人口是从事农业生产的农民。因此，迅速恢复战后农村经济事业是我国人民在经济上的重要任务之一。
    在发展农村经济上应着重提出的问题是：为了保障农民的生产，要供应许多畜力、拖拉机和肥料，要对迅速恢复灌溉设施的事业加以注意。
    这次在莫斯科会谈的结果，使我国农业可以从苏联获得许多畜力和拖拉机，并可建设拖拉机修理工厂，恢复肥料工厂。这样就解决了我们在发展农村经济上的迫切问题。
    我们的大学和科学部门的实验室和图书馆在战时完全被破坏了。在恢复我们许多科学干部和大学生研究科学事业上所急需解决的各种实验室和图书馆方面，我们也可以得到苏联的援助。
    以上就是我们政府代表团这次在莫斯科与苏联政府会谈所达成的结果。
    这次朝苏两国政府会谈的结果，具有重大的政治意义。这一结果将使朝苏两国的友好关系进一步发展和加强到新的阶段；而且，在和平解决朝鲜问题和维护与保障远东及全世界和平与安全的伟大事业上，进了重要的一步。
    因此，全世界爱好和平的人民和朝苏两国人民一起，以极大的满意欢迎这一会谈的结果，并且认为这对和平民主和社会主义阵营的共同事业作了巨大的贡献。这是当然的事情。
    但是，美国统治集团无视全世界爱好和平人民的期望和要求，采取着和维持及保障亚洲及全世界和平与安全背道而驰的立场。
    现在，美国统治集团在根据朝鲜停战协定的条款行将召开的政治会议工作程序及其成员问题上所采取的态度，受到全世界爱好和平阵营尖锐的非难。美国统治集团的这种态度，说明它们不愿意稳定在朝鲜达成的停战状态和最后地和平解决朝鲜问题。
    但是，我们将坚持维护我们民族利益和保障远东和平与安全的立场，决不从这个立场上后退一步，并将为争取使朝鲜人民不受外国干涉、自己解决朝鲜问题和实现我们祖国的和平统一独立而继续进行坚强的斗争。
    同胞们！我认为，苏联给予我们的如此巨大的援助和兄弟般的各人民民主国家给予我们的援助，已经为我们创造了能够加速进行恢复和建设我们战后人民经济的一切物质和技术条件。
    剩下的问题是我们朝鲜人民正确地利用这些援助的问题。
    我们是经历了三年祖国解放战争的锻炼，具有斗争力量的人民。
    我们全体朝鲜人民不要放松在战争时期的动员紧张态势，要像一个人似地团结在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的周围，一致奋起参加战后人民经济的恢复建设事业。
    我们要在短期内制定三年人民经济计划，并做好一切准备工作和动员工作，使它从一九五四年起，付诸实施。
    现在，我们要有力地进行摆在我们面前的今年度的秋收工作和明年度的春耕播种准备工作，同时要努力作好今年的过冬准备工作。
    我们要尽可能地使能够生产的机器都转动起来；要进行斗争来迅速建设建筑材料工厂，在短期内就开始供给基本建设事业以资材；要广泛地进行人民生活所急需的日用品的生产；其他各部门要有力地进行过冬准备，为明年的生产不受损害而进行工作。
    我们要动员国内的一切资源，正确地组织和使用劳动力，在经济部门要提高专门技术，广泛地进行作为解决经济建设资金的要素的增产节约运动，为了安定人民的生活要展开群众的互助运动。
    在战争期间，我们用鲜血决死地保卫了我们的祖国。今天，我们要以我们光荣的努力，很快地恢复我们祖国因战争而遭受的创伤。
    以光荣的努力来献身报效我们祖国和人民，是今天我们每一个公民的光荣任务。
    我们要把在战争火焰中获得的宝贵经验和发挥出来的空前的爱国主义与英雄主义精神，完全投入战后恢复事业和争取实现我国和平统一与独立的斗争中去。
    我确信，只要我们朝鲜人民像一个人似地团结起来，为恢复战后人民经济而进行斗争，并在以苏联为首的中国和各人民民主国家的援助下，我们必能克服我们面前的困难，在恢复战后人民经济的事业中取得胜利。
    亲爱的同志们！这次朝苏两国会谈的结果在全世界面前再一次证明：世界和平及安全的堡垒——伟大的苏联，不但是我们人民的解放者，而且是我们真正的援助者和亲密的朋友。
    由于苏联大公无私的积极援助，朝鲜在解放后以自己的手建立了人民政权，实现了各项民主改革。一九四九年和苏联缔结的经济与文化互助协定，更标志了我国发展史上一个重要的阶段。我们在为反抗美帝国主义武装侵略者及其走狗李承晚卖国匪帮而进行的祖国解放战争时期，苏联曾以自己的积极支持和声援来鼓舞和鼓励朝鲜人民走向胜利。在停战已经实现的今天，苏联为了早日恢复我们被破坏的人民经济，又首先发出援助我们人民的呼声，为我们拨出巨额的恢复援助金，并开始付诸实践。
    朝苏两国人民以解放和援助结成的牢固的友谊，不仅符合于朝苏两国的利益，而且有利于整个和平民主及社会主义阵营。
    我们将努力加强朝苏两国人民这种崇高的友谊，决不容许任何人来削弱这种友谊。
    我们只有进一步加强和以伟大的苏联人民为首的中华人民共和国及各人民民主国家人民兄弟般的友谊关系，才能像在战争中取得胜利一样，在战后恢复我国人民经济事业中和争取祖国和平统一与独立的斗争中，取得成果和胜利。
    我确信，全体朝鲜人民将高举国际主义的旗帜，为了我们民族的繁荣，为了建设一个强大的民主、统一、独立的国家，而团结得像一个人似地奋起执行全民族的历史使命。
    伟大的苏联人民和朝鲜人民永恒的友谊团结万岁！
    我们光荣的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！　（新华社平壤讯）
