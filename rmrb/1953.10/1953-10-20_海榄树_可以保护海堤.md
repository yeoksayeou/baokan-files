    "Sea Mangroves" Can Protect Seawalls - Hepu County Should Stop People from Cutting Them Down
    Reader Luo Deqi writes: Recently, many farmers in Dajiang Village, Fourth District, Hepu County, Guangxi Province, have been cutting down a lot of "sea mangroves" on the beach and taking them home to burn as firewood. "Sea mangroves" can defend against sea waves and protect seawalls; cutting down "sea mangroves" will expose the seawalls directly to the impact of strong winds and huge waves. I suggest that the local government should quickly educate the masses and stop the cutting. Other coastal areas should also pay attention to this situation.

    “海榄树”可以保护海堤  合浦县应制止群众砍伐
    读者罗德启来信：广西省合浦县第四区黄金乡大江村不少农民近来在海滩伐了很多“海榄树”，拉回家去做柴烧。“海榄树”可以防御海浪保护海堤；伐去了“海榄树”，就使海堤直接受到狂风巨浪的冲击。我建议当地政府应迅速教育群众，制止砍伐。其他沿海地区对这一情况也应加以注意。
