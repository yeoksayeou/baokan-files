Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, October 26th: Preparations for this winter's Huai River project are actively underway, and construction is expected to begin in November.

The requirements for the 1953 Huai River project are mainly to continue controlling Huai River floods, regulate river channels to reduce waterlogging disasters, and begin building some irrigation and shipping projects. This winter's project is a continuation of the project from the first half of the year. The main parts of the project, in terms of flood control, will continue to build the Boshan Reservoir and Nanwan Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Huai River in Henan Province; and continue to build the Foziling Reservoir in the middle reaches of the Huai River in Anhui Province. In terms of regulating river channels, Henan Province has the Huiji River dredging project, and Anhui Province has the diversion projects for the main stream and tributaries of the Huai River, the Sui River drainage project, the Bei Fei River drainage project, the Fei River diversion into the Wo River project, the Wo River dike repair project, and the shoal dredging project for the main stream of the Huai River. In addition, the project to raise the village platforms in the flood storage and flood discharge areas will begin this winter.

Preparations for this winter's Huai River project began in June. In order to fully utilize the potential construction force, accelerate the progress of the project, and save manpower and materials, the Huai River Management Committee focused on the Foziling Reservoir project and conducted experimental work on the reform of construction organization. After more than two months of efforts, great achievements have been made. In terms of mobilizing civilian labor, based on the experience of the past three years of Huai River management, this winter will be changed to a more fixed system of civilian labor, with the surplus rural labor force and the slack-season rural labor force forming the backbone team of Huai River management civilian laborers. This will not only save manpower and benefit rural production, but also facilitate the accumulation of construction experience and improve work efficiency. In order to take care of the lives of the civilian laborers, the wage standards have also been appropriately increased. In addition, the equipment cleanup work carried out by the Huai River management agencies at all levels since July has also been completed.

In order to ensure the smooth progress of this winter's Huai River project, from July to now, the Huai River Management Committee and the Huai River management agencies at all levels have successively convened meetings on engineering, political, financial, and equipment work, and formulated various work plans in accordance with the policy of increasing production and practicing economy. After the spring project, the Huai River management agencies at all levels also used the construction gap period to intensively train cadres, and held short-term training courses in hygiene, engineering, finance, and other specialties, which greatly improved the political and professional level of the cadres.

At present, 40 percent of the equipment required for the winter project has been allocated. In order to ensure full-scale construction in November, the Political Department of the Huai River Management Committee has specially organized working groups to go to various places in early October to assist in the work.

    今年冬季治淮工程准备工作正在积极进行
    【新华社蚌埠二十六日电】今年冬季治淮工程的准备工作正在积极进行中，十一月间将可开工。
    一九五三年度治淮工程的要求，主要是继续控制淮河洪水，整理河道减轻内涝灾害，并开始兴办一部分灌溉和航运工程。今年冬季工程是在上半年工程基础上继续进行的。工程的主要部分，拦蓄洪水方面，要在淮河上游河南省境内继续兴修薄山水库、南湾水库；在淮河中游安徽省境内继续修建佛子岭水库。整理河道方面，河南省有惠济河疏浚工程，安徽省有淮河干流和支流的分流工程、濉河排水工程、北淝河除涝工程、引淝河入涡河工程、修复涡河河堤工程和淮河干流的浅滩疏浚工程。此外，今年冬季将开始进行蓄洪区和行洪区的庄台加高工程。
    今年冬季治淮工程的准备工作，在六月份即开始进行。为充分发挥施工潜在力量，加速工程进度，节省人力物力，治淮委员会以佛子岭水库工程为重点，进行施工组织的改革试验工作，经过两个多月的努力，现已做出很大成绩。民力动员方面，根据过去三年治淮经验，今年冬季将改为比较固定性的民工制，以农村剩余劳动力和农闲劳动力组成治淮民工基干队，这样既可节省人力，利于农村生产，又便于积累施工经验，提高工作效率。为了照顾民工生活，工资标准也作了适当提高。此外，各级治淮机构从七月份开始进行的器材清理工作也已完成。
    为了保证今年冬季治淮工程顺利进行，从七月到现在，治淮委员会和各级治淮机构都曾先后召开了工程、政治、财务、器材工作等会议，根据增产节约的方针，制订出各项工作计划。春季工程结束后，各级治淮机构又曾利用施工空隙期间集训了干部，举办了卫生、工程、财务等专业短期训练班，使干部的政治水平和业务水平都大大提高了一步。
    现在，冬季工程中所需器材，已完成了调拨任务百分之四十。为了保证在十一月份全面施工，治淮委员会政治部特组织了工作组，在十月初分赴各地协助工作。
