Party Life

    The First Engineering Company General Branch Committee of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau, in its construction work last year, seriously discussed and studied the CCP Central Committee's instructions on Party building and carried out Party building work in a guided, planned, and prepared manner. Before Party building, the First Engineering Company General Branch Committee organized and trained Party building cadres, conducted typical experiments, and during construction, persisted in providing systematic communist education to the broad masses of workers and activists, and cultivated activists in conjunction with various movements and production tasks. On this basis, the Party organization developed two batches of Party members separately around the winter training of 1952. Among these new Party members, 41 were model workers. After Party building, the Party organization of the First Engineering Company continued to pay attention to providing systematic communist education to the broad masses of workers and has now newly cultivated more than 600 activists. The continuous growth of the Party and activist ranks has greatly promoted the progress of basic construction projects. The Party building work of the First Engineering Company Party organization has explored some experiences:

    1.  By means of Party lectures, systematic communist education was conducted among the broad masses of workers and activists, continuously enhancing the workers' class consciousness. This is the most important preparatory work in Party building. It is difficult to adhere to the Party lecture system during the construction season. However, as long as it is well organized, these difficulties can be overcome. According to the experience of the First Engineering Company Party organization, attention must be paid to solving the following problems:

    Solving the problem of time. Basic construction in the Northeast region is seasonal production, with heavy tasks and tight schedules. Conducting Party education during the construction season initially encounters the difficulty of time constraints. In the beginning, because the First Engineering Company did not have a unified plan for the use of leisure time, the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League competed for time, often squeezing out Party lecture time. The Party General Branch, based on this situation, jointly studied and formulated a unified distribution system for leisure activities with the administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, determining that Tuesday evenings from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM would be used for Party and League lectures (mainly for Party members, League members, and activists who voluntarily attend), and requiring each department to adhere to this system. If it is necessary to hold meetings or do other things during Party lecture time, it must be with the permission of the Party branch. This is how the Party lecture education system was maintained.

    Strengthening ideological education, gradually mobilizing workers and activists to participate in Party lectures, and finding ways to expand the effectiveness of lectures. Basic construction work is mostly heavy physical labor, and workers are very tired after working all day. Based on this situation, the Party organization cannot take up too much time for Party lectures, nor can it organize activists and workers all at once to listen to lectures. It must patiently carry out ideological mobilization, enlighten the masses' consciousness, and gradually organize everyone to voluntarily participate in learning. For example, at the Large Electrical Machinery Plant construction site, only 30 people initially participated in Party lectures. Later, after Party members, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League carried out publicity and mobilization, 300 people participated in learning by the summer of this year. Some units organized people who listened to the lectures to go back and promote the lectures to other workers in order to expand the effect of listening to the lectures.

    The content of Party lectures should also be closely integrated with reality, focusing on solving one problem each time. Before explaining the eight conditions for Party membership, first use forums, individual talks, and other methods to understand the workers' ideological situation and determine the content of the lectures based on the main problems in the workers' thinking. For example, at the Large Electrical Machinery Plant construction site last year, when implementing the responsibility system, criticism and self-criticism could not be carried out among technical personnel, staff members, and some workers, and the responsibility system movement was slow to progress. Based on this situation, the Party organization decided to specifically explain the sixth condition for Party membership in the Party lectures: why criticism and self-criticism should be carried out, who can master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and how to conduct criticism and self-criticism. After education, activists and workers dared to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and the responsibility system movement was vigorously launched. This spring, it was found that labor discipline among workers was lax, and the phenomenon of arriving late and leaving early was quite serious. After analyzing these thoughts, the branch carried out education on cherishing state property and organizational discipline through Party lectures. After the lectures, the phenomenon of arriving late and leaving early gradually disappeared. Some workers who did not live at the construction site in the past also moved their bedding to the site.

    2. Cultivating and examining activists through current work, adapting to the characteristics of construction, so that Party building is closely integrated with the central task. To achieve this, it is necessary to:

    Select activists from the completion of production tasks and various activities, pay attention to the model and advanced figures in production as Party activists, and determine them as activists when they are considered qualified and continue to cultivate them. When cultivating activists, organize them into current production work or movements, give full play to their role, and make them organizers and promoters in the current production movement. Before carrying out a certain movement, the First Engineering Company Party organization often holds a conference of Party members, League members, and activists for mobilization. At the meeting, requirements are put forward to Party members, League members, and activists respectively. In addition, the Party organization often uses forums or individual talks to assign tasks to activists (such as solving a key problem in current production or requiring them to understand the ideological situation of the masses and publicize certain Party policies), teaches them working methods, and asks them to report on the implementation. Among the 32 activists at a construction site, 23 became propagandists in production. Through the publicity and mobilization of these activists, a certain role was played in promoting the completion of the project one month ahead of schedule in 1952 at this construction site. Furthermore, advanced figures such as Su Changyou, who created the method of bricklaying by squeezing mortar with both hands, Yang Dezhong, who created the assembly line method of plastering, and Xie Wanfu, who created the assembly line method of carpentry, are all activists of this company (some have now become Party members). Therefore, some construction site cadres reflected: adding an activist adds a point of strength to production. Some administrative cadres who originally thought that Party building affected production have now actively participated in Party building work.

    In response to the law of frequent transfers and high mobility in basic construction units, the First Engineering Company Party organization established a series of management systems such as activist lists, cards, record keeping, and relationship transfers. The branch registers activists in all aspects, fills out cards, and establishes a regular activist "record" book, filling in the ideological and work performance of activists. When activists transfer work, the original branch promptly transfers the materials. Another organization can continue to carry out investigation and cultivation work on the basis of the investigation by the original branch. This ensures that the Party organization can carry out systematic cultivation and examination of activists, enabling them to quickly improve to the level of Party members.

    3. Organizing and training Party building cadres is the key to carrying out Party building work in basic construction departments. According to the experience of the First Engineering Company Party organization, to do this work well, the Party committee must attach importance to it, strengthen specific leadership, and have someone specifically responsible. Like other basic construction units, the First Engineering Company has a weak Party organization, few Party members, and they are mostly concentrated in the organs, which has led to the phenomenon of heavy Party building tasks and insufficient subjective strength. Therefore, in addition to mobilizing the entire Party to act and organizing all possible forces, it is also necessary to strengthen the leadership and training of Party building cadres. The Party organization of the First Engineering Company once planned to develop a batch of Party members on "July 1" in 1952, but it failed because there was no one specifically responsible and no specific leadership. In July, after the higher-level Party committee criticized the company's leadership for not paying attention to Party building work, it re-formulated the plan, and the General Branch Organization Committee was specifically responsible for carrying out key experiments to create experience, and at the same time providing specific guidance to the branches, teaching methods, and establishing a learning and reporting inspection system (every one to two weeks, the branch secretary reports to the General Branch once, and at the same time studies and arranges work). In addition, in order to mobilize the entire Party to act, leading cadres took the lead in doing Party building work.

    The higher-level Party committee held a lecture on Party building work knowledge once a week at the end of winter training. The First Engineering Company General Branch adopted the method of "learning while doing." After the Municipal Party Committee gave each lecture, the General Branch transmitted it to all Party members and mobilized all Party members to do it in practice. This not only improved the ability of Party member cadres to do Party building work, but also carried out Party building mobilization. The General Branch personally conducts key experiments, summarizes Party building work every one or two months, draws lessons from it, discovers problems, reports to all Party building cadres and Party members, and then organizes discussions by branch to improve their ability to do Party building work with practical experience. The construction site branch also frequently convenes Party building work symposiums, where experienced organizers or Party members introduce experience or study and solve problems in Party building.

    In addition to mobilizing the entire Party to do Party building work, the Party organization of the First Engineering Company also equipped five full-time organizers. In addition, it organized the forces of the trade union and the Communist Youth League to cooperate with Party building to carry out the following work: submit the list of activists under its system to the Party, materials and comprehensive opinions; carry out communist propaganda and education among workers, cadres and League members; strengthen the work of the Communist Youth League and the trade union in units with a weak work foundation, and create conditions for Party building work from various aspects.

    有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司党组织在施工中进行建党工作的经验
    中共有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司总支委员会，在去年施工中，认真地讨论研究了中共中央的建党指示，有领导、有计划、有准备地进行了建党工作。第一工程公司总支委员会在建党之前，组织与训练了建党干部，进行了典型试验，在施工中坚持对广大职工与积极分子进行系统的共产主义教育，并结合各种运动与生产任务，培养了积极分子。在这个基础上，党组织于一九五二年冬训前后曾分别发展了两批党员。这些新党员中有四十一名是劳动模范。第一工程公司党组织在建党之后，继续注意对广大职工进行系统的共产主义教育，现在又新培养了六百余名积极分子。党和积极分子队伍的不断壮大，对于基本建设工程的进展起了很大的推动作用。第一工程公司党组织的建党工作已经摸索出一些经验：
    一、通过上党课的形式，向广大职工与积极分子进行了系统的共产主义教育，使职工的阶级觉悟不断地提高，这是建党工作中最重要的准备工作。在施工季节中，坚持上党课制度是有困难的。但是只要组织得好，这些困难是可以克服的。根据第一工程公司党组织的经验，必须注意解决以下几个问题：
    解决时间问题。东北地区的基本建设是季节性的生产，任务重、时间紧，在施工季节中进行党课教育首先要碰到时间困难的问题。在开始时，由于第一工程公司对业余时间的支配没有统一的计划，每到业余时间，党、行政、工会、青年团就互相争时间，往往把党课教育时间挤掉了。党总支就根据这一情况与行政、工会、青年团共同研究规定了业余活动时间的统一分配制度，确定每星期二晚上七时至八时为上党课与团课时间（主要对象为党员、团员和自愿参加旁听的积极分子），并要求各部门坚持这一制度。如果必须在党课时间开会或作其他事情时，则要经过党支部的允许。这样就坚持了党课教育制度。
    加强思想教育，逐步地动员职工和积极分子参加党课，并设法扩大讲课的效果。基本建设工作多是重体力劳动，工人工作一天后已很疲劳。根据这种情况，党组织就不能占很长的时间来上党课，而且也不能一下子把积极分子和职工都组织起来听课，必须耐心地进行思想动员，启发群众的自觉，逐步地组织大家自愿参加学习。如大型电机厂工地开始参加党课学习的只有三十个人，以后经过党员和工会、青年团进行宣传动员，到今年夏天已有三百人参加学习。有的单位组织听课的人回去向其他工人宣传，以扩大听课的效果。
    党课内容还要紧密结合实际，每次集中解决一个问题。讲党员标准的八项条件之前，先用座谈会、个别谈话等方式，了解职工的思想情况，针对职工思想中的主要问题确定讲课内容。如大型电机厂工地去年贯彻责任制时，在技术人员、职员和部分工人中，展不开批评和自我批评，开展责任制运动迟迟不前。根据这个情况，党组织确定在党课中专门讲党员标准第六条，为什么要开展批评与自我批评，什么人才能掌握批评与自我批评的武器，怎样进行批评与自我批评等。经过教育之后，积极分子和职工们敢于进行批评和自我批评了，责任制运动就轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。今年春天发现职工中劳动纪律松懈，迟到早退的现象相当严重。支部分析了这些思想后，就通过讲党课，进行爱护国家财产和组织性纪律性的教育。讲完后，迟到早退的现象逐渐消灭。有些过去不在工地住的工人也都把铺盖搬到现场来住了。
    二、通过当前工作，适应施工特点来培养考察积极分子，使建党与中心任务紧密结合。要做到这
    一点就需要：
    从完成生产任务和各种活动中挑选积极分子，注意把生产中的模范先进人物作为党的积极分子，认为够条件时即确定为积极分子并继续进行培养。在培养积极分子时，要把积极分子组织到当前生产工作或运动中去，充分发挥他们的作用，使他们成为当前生产运动中的组织者与宣传者。第一工程公司党组织在进行某一项运动之前常常先召开党员、团员与积极分子大会进行动员，会上对党员、团员和积极分子分别提出要求。此外，党组织还经常用座谈会或个别谈话形式给积极分子布置任务（如解决当前生产中的某一关键问题或要他们了解群众思想情况与宣传党的某些政策等），教给工作办法，并要他们汇报执行情况。有个工地的三十二名积极分子中，就有二十三名成为生产中的宣传员，经过这些积极分子的宣传鼓动，在推动这个工地一九五二年提前一个月完成工程任务当中起了一定作用。再如创造双手挤浆砌砖法的苏长有，创造抹灰流水作业法的杨德重，创造木工流水作业法的谢万福等先进人物，都是这个公司的积极分子（有的现在已成为党员）。因此，有些工地干部反映：添上一个积极分子生产上就增加一分力量。原来认为建党影响生产的某些行政干部，后来都积极地参加了建党工作。
    针对基本建设单位调动多、流动性大的规律，第一工程公司党组织建立了积极分子名单、卡片、记事、转关系等一系列的管理制度。对各方面的积极分子，支部都进行登记，填写卡片，建立经常的积极分子“记事”簿，填写积极分子的思想与工作表现。积极分子调动工作时，原支部便及时将材料转去。另一个组织便可在原支部考察的基础上继续进行考察培养工作。这样就保证了党组织能够对积极分子进行系统的培养考察工作，使其很快提高到党员的水平。
    三、组织与训练建党干部，这是基本建设部门进行建党工作的关键。根据第一工程公司党组织的经验，要做好这一工作必须党委重视，加强具体领导，同时有专人负责。第一工程公司与其他基本建设单位一样，党的组织薄弱，党员少，且多集中在机关，因而就产生了建党任务繁重，主观力量不足的现象。因此，除动员全党动手，组织一切可能使用的力量外，还需要加强对建党干部的领导与训练。第一工程公司党组织曾经计划一九五二年“七一”发展一批党员，但因无专人负责，也没有具体领导，所以落了空。七月，上级党委对该公司领导不重视建党工作进行批评后，又重新订了计划，并由总支组织委员专门负责进行重点试验以创造经验，同时对各支部进行具体领导，教给办法，建立学习与汇报检查制度（每一至二周支部书记到总支汇报
    一次，同时研究布置工作）。此外，为了动员全党动手，领导干部都带头做建党工作。
    上级党委在冬训末期，每星期举办一次建党工作知识讲座。第一工程公司总支采取了“边学、边作”的方法，市委每讲一课后，总支就向全体党员进行传授和发动全体党员实地去作。这样不但提高了党员干部做建党工作的能力，同时也进行了建党动员。总支亲自进行重点试验，每一两个月总结一次建党工作，从中吸取经验、发现问题，向全体建党干部和党员作报告，再以支部为单位组织讨论，用实际经验来提高他们做建党工作的能力。工地支部也经常召集建党工作座谈会，由有经验的组织员或党员介绍经验或研究解决建党中的问题。
    第一工程公司党组织除发动全党动手做建党工作之外，还配备了五名专职组织员。此外并组织了工会、青年团的力量，配合建党进行了以下工作：向党提出所属系统下的积极分子的名单、材料及全面意见；在工人、干部和团员中进行共产主义的宣传教育；在工作基础薄弱的单位，加强青年团和工会工作，从多方面着手为建党工作创造条件。
