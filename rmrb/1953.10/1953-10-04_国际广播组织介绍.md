    Introduction to the International Broadcasting Organization

    The International Broadcasting Organization was established in Brussels, the capital of Belgium, on June 26, 1946, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. At that time, the organization had twenty-six member states, including the Soviet Union and various People's Democracies in Eastern Europe, as well as France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Egypt, Syria, and other countries. Later, under pressure from the United States, most capitalist countries' broadcasting organizations withdrew from the organization one after another and separately established the so-called "European Broadcasting Union" to oppose the International Broadcasting Organization. The International Broadcasting Organization moved its headquarters from Brussels to Prague in 1950. Currently, there are eighteen member states: the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, Hungary, Mongolia, Bulgaria, Albania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Karelia-Finland, Moldova, and Finland. Among them, the Soviet Union, China, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, and Estonia are the member states of the council.

    The mission of the International Broadcasting Organization is to strive for international cooperation in broadcasting, maintain order in the airwaves, and exchange experience in broadcasting programs and radio technology. The Technical Committee led by this organization, with the assistance of Soviet experts, has provided member states with high-level technical experience in radio broadcasting technology, television, and recording. The "Technical Center Station" established by this organization has also made many valuable contributions in protecting the legitimate broadcasting rights and interests of member states, exposing the sabotage of the Copenhagen frequency allocation plan by the United States, Britain, and France, and opposing reactionary propaganda from the United States. Under the technical guidance of the station, the broadcasting stations of the International Broadcasting Organization's Eastern European member states have effectively countered the reactionary broadcasting propaganda of the "Radio Free Europe" stations established by U.S. imperialism in West Germany, France, and Italy, and have protected the broadcasting of Eastern European member states from interference and infringement.

    In the past two years, the International Broadcasting Organization has also played a role in promoting the world peace movement. Last year, the 22nd session of the organization's council issued a declaration calling on all broadcasting organizations and radio workers around the world to faithfully and thoroughly report the resolutions of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and the Vienna World People's Peace Congress. This call was echoed by more than forty non-member broadcasting stations and achieved great results.

    In recent years, the close cooperation between the member states of the International Broadcasting Organization has been reflected not only in the broadcasting agreements signed between some member states to exchange programs and broadcasting work experience, but also in the organizational work of broadcasting propaganda on major international events by various member states. For example, the broadcasting propaganda for the Fourth World Youth and Students Peace and Friendship Festival held in Bucharest in August this year, thanks to the assistance of the International Broadcasting Organization and the Romanian Broadcasting Committee, enabled one hundred broadcasting staff members sent by member states such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Bulgaria to work smoothly, so that the activities, speeches, and important performances of the festival were broadcast to the world in nearly fifty languages by member states of the International Broadcasting Organization. This broadcasting propaganda experience will be very helpful for the close cooperation between the member states in broadcasting propaganda in the future.

    Our country's broadcasting organization officially joined the organization in 1952. At the 22nd session of the organization's council last year, Mei Yi, Director of the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau of our country, was elected as the chairman of the council for 1953. The 24th session of the council and the 9th session of the Technical Committee of the International Broadcasting Organization held in Beijing this time, in addition to discussing the work reports of the council and the Technical Committee and making resolutions, also passed the proposal submitted by our delegation to support the World Peace Council's proposal to launch a worldwide movement aimed at easing international tensions and resolving international disputes peacefully. At the same time, the meeting called on all broadcasting workers to actively participate in and promote the development of this movement and to expose the aggressive conspiracies of the enemies of peace through broadcasting.

    国际广播组织介绍
    国际广播组织是根据联合国宪章于一九四六年六月二十六日在比利时首都布鲁塞尔成立的。当时这个组织拥有二十六个会员国，除苏联及东欧各人民民主国家以外，还有法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰以及埃及、叙利亚等国。其后多数资本主义国家的广播组织在美国的压力下，先后退出这个组织，而另外成立了所谓“欧洲广播协会”，以与国际广播组织对立。国际广播组织从一九五○年即将会址从布鲁塞尔迁至布拉格。目前共有十八个会员国：苏联、中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、蒙古、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚、立陶宛、白俄罗斯、乌克兰、卡累利阿—芬兰、摩尔达维亚、芬兰。其中苏、中、捷、波、匈、保、阿尔巴尼亚及爱沙尼亚八国为组织的理事国。
    国际广播组织的任务是争取国际间广播的合作，维持空中秩序，交流广播宣传节目与无线电技术的经验。这个组织所领导的技术委员会在苏联专家的帮助下，在无线电广播技术、电视及录音等方面，曾为各会员国提供了水平很高的技术经验。这个组织所设立的“技术中心站”，在保护各会员国正当的广播权益、揭露美英法三国破坏哥本哈根频率分配计划、反对美国反动宣传方面，也曾作了许多宝贵的贡献。在该站的技术指导下，国际广播组织所属东欧各会员国的广播电台，有力地打击了美帝国主义设在西德、法国和意大利境内的“自由欧洲广播电台”的反动广播宣传，并保障了东欧各会员国的广播免受干扰与侵犯。
    近两年来，国际广播组织在促进世界和平运动方面也起了一些作用。去年该组织理事会第二十二次会议曾发表宣言，号召全世界一切广播组织及无线电工作者忠实而详尽地报道亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议和维也纳世界人民和平大会的决议，这个号召得到了四十多个非会员国广播电台的响应，收到了很大的效果。
    近年来，国际广播组织各会员国之间的密切合作，不仅表现在若干会员国之间先后签订了用以交换节目及广播工作经验的广播协定，而且表现在各会员国关于国际上重大事件的广播宣传的组织工作方面，比如今年八月间在布加勒斯特举行的第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的广播宣传，由于国际广播组织和罗马尼亚广播委员会的帮助，使捷、匈、波、保等会员国派遣的一百名广播工作人员得以顺利工作，使得联欢节的活动、演讲及重要演出，由国际广播组织会员国以将近五十种语言向全世界播送。这种广播宣传的经验，将对今后各会员国广播宣传方面的密切合作很有帮助。
    我国广播机构是在一九五二年正式参加这个组织的。在去年这个组织理事会第二十二次会议上，我国广播事业局局长梅益当选为一九五三年理事会主席。国际广播组织此次在北京举行的理事会第二十四次会议及技术委员会第九次会议，除讨论了这个组织理事会及技术委员会各项工作报告并作出决议以外，并通过了我国代表团所提出的支持世界和平理事会关于展开旨在缓和国际局势而以和平方式解决国际争端的世界性运动的建议。同时，这次会议并号召所有广播工作者积极参加并促进这一运动的开展，通过广播来揭露和平敌人的侵略阴谋。
