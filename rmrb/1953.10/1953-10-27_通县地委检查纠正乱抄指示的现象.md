    Tong County Prefectural Committee Inspects and Corrects the Phenomenon of Indiscriminate Copying of Instructions
    Shang Kai
    In the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, various localities have exposed and criticized the bureaucratic subjectivism of leading organs at all levels in issuing instructions indiscriminately without regard to actual conditions. This was entirely necessary. Although this phenomenon has greatly changed to date, it still exists seriously in some places. The "Instructions on Mobilizing to Carry Out Production for Self-Salvation" issued by the Liangxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in September this year is an example of issuing instructions indiscriminately. This year, Liangxiang in Tong County, Hebei Province, had a partial autumn harvest failure in some areas. The Liangxiang County Committee should have foreseen this and mobilized the masses to pay attention to saving food and preventing famine. However, this instruction of the Liangxiang County Committee was not drafted based on the actual conditions of the county, but was pieced together by copying from various sources.
    The first half of this instruction was copied from the Cang County Prefectural Committee's "Instructions on Starting Production for Self-Salvation as Soon as Possible." However, the specific conditions of these two regions are clearly different. Cang County Prefecture suffered from continuous heavy rains and the breach of the canal, resulting in a more severe disaster. Some of the most severely affected areas only harvested 20-30% of the crop. Therefore, the Cang County Prefectural Committee's instructions required the party organizations in these areas to actively lead the people to carry out production for self-salvation in order to overcome the severe famine. Liangxiang County, on the other hand, had an average of over 70% harvest this year, but the Liangxiang County Committee also stated in its instructions that the county's disaster situation was serious and that party organizations at all levels should lead production for self-salvation. The Cang County Prefectural Committee estimated that some people might have difficulty in life this winter and spring. Therefore, the instructions required party organizations to not only mobilize the masses to save food, but also to collect wild vegetables and other substitutes in preparation for food shortages. The Liangxiang County Committee also required party organizations at all levels to mobilize the masses to collect wild vegetables and other substitutes to overcome the famine... But, taking the grain-deficient areas of Liangxiang as an example, there has always been a foundation for sideline production, such as weaving mats and boiling saltpeter. At the same time, these areas have more vehicles and horses and can develop transportation. The Liangxiang County Committee's instructions should have called on the masses to develop sideline occupations from the perspective of active production to overcome the disaster, instead of copying the call to collect wild vegetables and other substitutes to overcome the famine.
    The second half of the Liangxiang County Committee's instructions was copied from the Hebei Provincial Committee's "Instructions on Vigorously Supporting Disaster Areas." The Hebei Provincial Committee's instructions stated: "Appropriately streamline institutions," "Conscientiously reduce appropriations for projects that can be reduced, postponed, or are dispensable," and "Unnecessary construction should be stopped." This was a general call for economy issued by the Hebei Provincial Committee for the entire province. The Liangxiang County Committee should have proposed, according to the actual situation of Liangxiang, which organizational structures were excessively large and needed to be streamlined, how to streamline them, which of Liangxiang's project appropriations could be reduced, which could be postponed, and which construction projects could be stopped. However, the Liangxiang County Committee did not do this, but simply "copied the gourd as it was" and sent down the Hebei Provincial Committee's instructions verbatim.
    This practice of the Liangxiang County Committee copying instructions is very bad. Because this approach not only cannot mobilize the masses to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, but on the contrary, it will confuse the masses' thinking. After discovering this situation, the Tong County Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party strictly criticized the Liangxiang County Committee's bureaucratic subjectivism. But how did the Liangxiang County Committee understand this mistake? Comrade Zhang Lingde, secretary of the county party committee, said: "Because everyone is a practical cadre, not a pen-pushing cadre, and cannot write instructions." and "hoped that the prefectural committee would quickly provide Liangxiang with cadres who can write." It may be a fact that the Liangxiang County Committee lacks cadres who can write, but is the main reason for this kind of copying of instructions because of a lack of writing cadres? Should comrades who do practical work but cannot write copy instructions? "Practical cadres" should be the most familiar with the actual situation, the most familiar with the demands of the masses, and the easiest to propose work plans that are practical and meet the demands of the masses. However, the "practical cadres" of the Liangxiang County Committee are not like this. Instead, they are using the work instructions of the Cang County Prefectural Committee, which is hundreds of miles away and inconsistent with the actual situation of the county. If it were merely a matter of low literacy, the instructions written would at most be grammatically incorrect and use inappropriate words, but it would never turn the county's 70% harvest into a serious disaster; it would never say that the lives of the county's masses are not difficult, saying they are very difficult. Therefore, the problem is simply that the work of these "practical cadres" is not practical. They do not understand the actual situation, or even if they do understand the actual situation, they do not act according to the actual situation, but instead piece together an impractical instruction by copying from various sources to "guide" the work. This is the essence of the problem.
    Such erroneous instructions could have been prevented if the Liangxiang County Committee had strong collective leadership. On the contrary, these instructions were written and issued under decentralized circumstances. An instruction on the production and lives of hundreds of thousands of people in the county, the Liangxiang County Committee did not convene a meeting to discuss it, but instead, County Party Secretary Zhang Lingde assigned a cadre to write it. After this cadre pieced it together by copying from various sources, not only was it not discussed by the County Party Committee, but even Zhang Lingde himself did not finish reading it before sending it to subordinate organizations for implementation. Clearly, the reason for writing and issuing instructions so rashly is absolutely not because of a lack of writing cadres, but rather a lack of a spirit of being seriously responsible to the Party and the people.
    According to the inspection of the Tong County Prefectural Committee, this situation is not an isolated case in the Tong County Prefectural Committee. The Ji County County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also disregarded the specific conditions of the county and copied and issued the Tong County Prefectural Committee's "Instructions on Strengthening Leadership in Wheat Planting Work." It was so serious that even the secretary of the Ji County County Committee did not read it before it was issued. It was not until the Tong County Prefectural Committee discovered and criticized it that the secretary of the Ji County County Committee realized that such an erroneous instruction had been issued. This phenomenon cannot be tolerated. Party committees at all levels must inspect the instruction documents issued by each county like the Tong County Prefectural Committee, and promptly correct this serious bureaucracy and subjectivism to ensure that the work of the Party can proceed smoothly.

### 通县地委检查纠正乱抄指示的现象

    通县地委检查纠正乱抄指示的现象
    商恺
    各地在反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争中，曾揭发与批判了各级领导机关的不根据实际情况乱发指示的官僚主义主观主义，这是完全必要的。至今为止，这种现象虽然大有改变，但在有些地方仍旧严重地存在着。中共良乡县委在今年九月发出的“关于动员起来开展生产自救的指示”，就是一个乱发指示的例子。今年河北省通县专区的良乡，有部分地区秋禾歉收，良乡县委应当有预见地动员群众注意节约粮食，防备灾荒。但是良乡县委的这项指示却并不是根据本县的实际情况拟出来的，而是东抄西抄拼凑起来的。
    这个指示的前半部分抄自沧县地委“关于及早动手开展生产自救工作的指示”。但是这两个地区的具体情况显然不同，沧县专区因大雨连绵，运河决口，灾情较重，部分最严重的地区只收二三成，因此沧县地委的指示中要求这些地区的党组织必须积极领导人民群众开展生产自救运动，以便渡过严重的灾荒；而良乡县今年平均有七成以上年景，良乡县委却在指示中也说，本县灾情严重，也要各地党组织领导生产自救运动。沧县地委估计今冬明春可能有部分群众的生活有困难，因此在指示中要求党组织除发动群众节省粮食外，还要采集野菜等代食品，以备粮荒；良乡县委也要求各级党组织发动群众采集野菜等代食品，以便渡荒……。但以良乡歉收地区来说，历来有副业生产的基础，如编席、熬硝等，同时这些地区的车马较多，可以发展运输事业，而因良乡县委这一指示也应该从积极生产方面去号召群众发展副业，克服灾荒，用不着照样提出采集野菜等代食品来渡荒。
    良乡县委指示中的后半部分，是从河北省委“关于大力支援灾区的指示”中抄来的。河北省委指示中提出：“适当精减机构”，“认真地削减那些可以削减的，可以推迟的，或可办可不办的事业拨款”，“不必要的兴建，应予停止”。这是河北省委针对全省一般情况提出的节约号召，良乡县委应当按照良乡实际情况，提出那些组织机构过分庞大，需要精减，怎样精减，良乡县事业拨款中有那些是可以削减的，有那些是可以推迟的，有那些兴建是可以停止的。但是，良乡县委没有这样作，而只是“依样画葫芦”地把河北省委的指示照抄照发下去。
    良乡县委会这种抄袭指示的作风是非常不好的。因为这种作法不仅不能发动群众开展增产节约运动，相反的，会使群众思想混乱。中共通县地委发现这个情况后，严格地批评了良乡县委的这种官僚主义主观主义。但是良乡县委对这个错误是怎样认识的呢？县委书记张令德同志说：“因为大家都是实际干部，不是笔杆子干部，写指示写不了。”并“希望地委快给良乡配备会写作的干部”。良乡县委缺少能写作的干部可能是事实，但是产生这种照抄指示的主要原因是不是因为缺少写作干部呢？难道作实际工作不会写作的同志就应该照抄指示吗？“实际干部”应该是最熟悉实际情况，最熟悉群众的要求，最容易提出切合实际切合群众要求的工作计划的。可是良乡县委会的“实际干部”恰恰不是如此，而是搬用数百里以外与本县实际情况不符合的沧县地委的工作指示。如果仅仅是文化水平不高的话，所写的指示最多不过是语法不通，用词不当，决不会把全县七成年景写成了严重灾情；决不会把全县群众生活并不困难说成十分困难。因此问题只是在于这些“实际干部”的工作并不实际。他们不了解实际情况，或者虽然了解实际情况但并不根据实际情况去办事，而是东抄西抄地去拼凑一个不合实际的指示来“指导”工作。这就是这一问题的实质。
    这样错误的指示，如果良乡县委集体领导强的话，是可以防止的。恰恰相反，这个指示是在分散情况下写出来和发出去的。像这样关系到全县数十万人民群众的生产、生活问题的指示，良乡县委会就没有召开会议进行讨论，而是由县委书记张令德指定一个干部来写，由这一干部东抄西抄拼凑起来以后，不只是没有经过县委会讨论，甚至张令德自己也没有看完，便发给了下级组织去执行。很显然，这样轻率地写指示和发指示的原因，绝对不是因为缺乏写作干部，而是缺乏对党对人民认真负责的精神。
    据通县地委的检查，这种情况在通县地委来说，也不是个别的，中共蓟县县委会，也是不顾本县具体情况，照抄照发了通县地委“关于加强种麦工作领导的指示”，也严重到连蓟县县委书记没有阅看就发出去了，等通县地委发觉批评以后，蓟县县委书记才知道发了这样错误的指示。这种现象是不能容忍的，各级党委，必须像通县地委一样的检查各县所发的指示文件，及时纠正这种严重的官僚主义、主观主义，以保证党的工作能顺利地进行。
