    Teachers and students of the Department of Public Health of Dalian Medical College conducted investigation, research, and prevention and treatment of endemic diseases in Changhai County.
    Professors, teaching assistants, and students of the Public Health Teaching and Research Group of Dalian Medical College went to Changhai County during the summer vacation to investigate, research, and treat endemic diseases, and to publicize hygiene knowledge to the residents. Forty teachers and students treated more than 6,000 people from late July to late August, and also used various forms of art to carry out publicity, so that the majority of residents received education in hygiene knowledge. Changhai County is composed of seventeen large and small islands, located northeast of Dalian. The island is rich in fish and shrimp, and the residents mostly like to eat raw food and have the habit of going barefoot, so many suffer from ascariasis and hookworm disease. After the teachers and students of Dalian Medical College arrived there, they divided into many groups to go to various small islands to carry out publicity and treatment work, so that many residents suffering from various parasitic diseases were thoroughly treated and regained their health.
