In September, most cotton-producing areas across the country entered the harvest season. New cotton in provinces along the Yangtze River, such as Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Hubei, began to enter the market successively in mid-August. Now, new cotton in the Yellow River basin and cotton-producing areas such as Hebei has also entered the market in large quantities.

In order to promptly launch the new cotton purchasing work and allow farmers to sell cotton calmly, cooperatives in various regions have started purchasing based on the new cotton prices stipulated by the state this year. In some areas, the amount of cotton entering the market has basically met the cooperatives' purchasing plan requirements because the cooperatives have vigorously publicized and explained the seasonal price difference policy for cotton. For example, in Lingbao County, Henan Province, before cotton entered the market, cotton farmers were preparing to rush to the market to sell their cotton. After the seasonal price difference was announced, the local county party committee led the grassroots cooperatives to convene meetings of cooperative member representatives to correctly explain the rationale behind the state's seasonal price difference. As a result, cotton farmers were no longer in a hurry to sell cotton. In Anyang City, Henan Province, after the cotton purchasing cadres of the cooperative patiently publicized the seasonal price difference to the cotton farmers at the purchasing points, the daily amount of cotton entering the market met the local cooperative's purchasing plan.

However, in many cotton-producing areas, the seasonal price difference announced by the government has not been explained to the masses in a timely manner, and the publicity work has not been well coordinated with the purchasing work. For example, cotton farmers near Xinji Town in Hebei Province are still unclear about this year's cotton purchasing policy, and their thinking is quite confused. After the cotton harvest, they rush to the market in large quantities, and the purchasing personnel are overwhelmed. Cotton farmers have to queue for a day to sell their cotton. This will cause dissatisfaction among the masses and easily lead to market chaos and unscrupulous private merchants taking the opportunity to depress prices and抢购 (qiǎnggòu - panic buying/rushing to purchase).

In order to protect the interests of cotton farmers and do a good job in this year's new cotton purchasing work, cotton-producing area cooperatives must, under the leadership of the local Party committee, rapidly launch and vigorously strengthen the publicity work on cotton price policies, especially the publicity work on seasonal price differences, so that it is known to every cotton farmer.

When publicizing the seasonal price difference to the general cotton farmers, we should first affirm the cotton farmers' contributions to the country in recent years, strengthen patriotic education to inspire their sense of honor in supporting national construction, and also emphasize that the development of cotton farmers' production in recent years is inseparable from the government's support and assistance. Then, explain the important significance of the state's seasonal price difference this year.

First of all, it should be explained that the seasonal price difference regulations in our country are fundamentally different from the so-called "seasonal price difference" in old China. In old China, the lifeline of the national economy was controlled by imperialists, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic capitalists. When the new cotton entered the market, these exploiters took advantage of the farmers' difficulty in selling in a hurry to pay rent and repay debts, and lowered prices to purchase, plundering the farmers. When the cotton off-season came, they frantically raised prices to seek exorbitant profits. The so-called "seasonal price difference" at that time was as high as 30% to 60%. Taking the cotton price in Shaanxi Province as an example, from June to September 1937, each dan (a traditional unit of weight) of cotton was worth 45.67 "legal currency" yuan. By October of the same year, when new cotton entered the market in large quantities, the price of each dan of cotton plummeted to 23.67 "legal currency" yuan. In Weinan cotton area of the province, from April to August 1936, each jin (a traditional unit of weight) of cotton could be exchanged for about 7.4 jin of wheat, but in September of the same year after the new cotton entered the market, each jin of cotton could only be exchanged for 4.9 jin of wheat. The cotton price differed by 58% in one month. Obviously, the seasonal price difference at that time only benefited a few exploiters, and the vast number of cotton farmers suffered from its exploitation. Such cruel exploitation is absolutely not allowed in the People's China. The seasonal price difference we have formulated now is based on the fact that cotton contains more moisture when it first enters the market and gradually dries later. In storage and preservation, it is also necessary to pay for necessary losses, interest, and保管 (bǎoguǎn - safekeeping) costs, etc. Therefore, it is completely reasonable and necessary to stipulate that the purchase price should be slightly lower at the beginning of the cotton market and gradually increase appropriately later to compensate cotton farmers for the losses and costs during the storage and sale period.

Secondly, it should be explained that a reasonable seasonal price difference is beneficial to the country, the cooperative, and the farmers. In the past three years, the state has not stipulated a seasonal price difference for cotton, which is inseparable from the state's cotton production and purchasing situation at that time. At that time, in terms of production, the area planted with cotton was still small, and the cotton output was not large. In terms of purchasing, due to the搶购 (qiǎnggòu - panic buying/rushing to purchase) and hoarding by奸商 (jiānshāng - unscrupulous merchants) and speculators, cotton prices fluctuated. Some cotton farmers had the idea of holding out for higher prices. Therefore, the state's purchasing plan could not be completed on time, and the cotton controlled by the state could not timely meet the needs of the textile industry and civilian wadding. However, in recent years, under the guidance of the price policy and other production increase measures that are extremely beneficial to the development of cotton production adopted by the People's Government, with the efforts of cotton farmers to actively increase production, and with the efforts of state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives to organize purchasing, the situation of disconnection between cotton production, purchasing, and demand has been fundamentally changed. Therefore, the stipulation of seasonal price differences for cotton this year has become a timely and necessary measure, which, for the country, can purchase cotton normally step by step and ensure the needs of the cotton textile industry and civilian wadding; for cooperatives, it can avoid忙乱 (mángluàn - rushing about in a disorderly fashion), reduce difficulties in warehousing,保管 (bǎoguǎn - safekeeping), etc., and can also reasonably adjust the supply of production materials and means of livelihood; for cotton farmers, it can avoid排队 (páiduì - queuing) and crowding when selling, wasting production time, and selling slowly will not suffer price losses, and will even be slightly beneficial.

Thirdly, it is necessary to use the method of careful calculation to clearly explain the principle that implementing the seasonal price difference is beneficial to cotton farmers who sell less first and more later, so that cotton farmers can keep some of the cotton that is not urgently needed for sale until November and December. However, when calculating and conducting publicity, it must be based on the actual local situation, be realistic and pragmatic, and neither exaggerate nor reduce it. This is very important.

Finally, when publicizing to cotton farmers, it should be repeatedly explained to cotton farmers that cotton is the main raw material for the country's industrial development. Now, asking cotton farmers to sell cotton according to the state plan does not mean that the state will not purchase cotton. On the contrary, the state and cooperatives guarantee to purchase regularly according to the plan. Therefore, farmers, especially poor farmers and some middle farmers, should be awakened to be vigilant against the speculative and巧取 (qiǎoqǔ - seize by trickery) behavior of奸商 (jiānshāng - unscrupulous merchants) and speculators, and prevent them from taking the opportunity to套购 (tàogòu - to buy something in order to resell it at a higher price) at low prices before the price adjustment or when farmers are eager to sell.

When grassroots cadres of cooperatives in various regions publicize seasonal price differences and implement the planned cotton purchasing policy, they must prevent the two tendencies of abandoning leadership and issuing coercive orders. On the one hand, we must patiently explain to cotton farmers the state's cotton purchasing policy this year and organize cotton farmers to sell cotton in a planned way. On the other hand, we must prevent急躁 (jízào - rashness) emotions. If there is a slight急躁 (jízào - rashness) emotion in the work of mobilizing cotton farmers to sell cotton calmly, it will lead to coercive orders and turn good things into bad things. In addition, the financial and economic departments in cotton-producing areas should strengthen the organization of purchasing and supply. For example, by holding small-scale material exchange meetings and other methods, actively prepare materials and expand the supply of industrial products and local and special products to meet the actual needs of cotton farmers. In purchasing, priority should be given to the sales requests of farmers in difficulty. When necessary, "cotton deposit" business should be handled to solve the difficulties of cotton farmers in保管 (bǎoguǎn - safekeeping) and sales.

    正确宣传棉花季节差价政策
    大力贯彻有计划购棉方针
    九月份，全国各产棉区大都进入收获季节。长江流域的江苏、江西、湖北等省的新棉在八月中旬即已陆续上市，现在黄河流域及河北等产棉区新棉也已大量上市。
    为了及时展开新棉收购工作，并使农民从容出售棉花，各地合作社均已根据今年国家规定的新棉价格开始收购。有些地区合作社由于对棉花季节差价政策进行了大力宣传解释工作，棉花上市量基本上已符合了合作社的收购计划要求。如河南灵宝县在棉花上市前，棉农准备把棉花一下涌向市场，急忙出售，季节差价公布后，经当地县委领导各基层合作社召开了社员代表会议，正确地说明国家规定季节差价的道理，棉农也就不急于售棉了。河南安阳市合作社收棉干部在收购点上耐心地对棉农进行了季节差价的宣传后，每日上市棉花数量就符合了当地合作社的收购计划。
    但也有不少棉区，对政府公布的季节差价，未及时向群众解释清楚，宣传工作没有很好地配合收购工作进行。例如河北辛集镇附近的棉农，对今年收棉方针还不清楚，思想相当混乱，棉花收获后急急忙忙地大量涌上市场，收购人员忙不过来，棉农出售棉花也须排队等上一日，才能卖掉。这样，群众就会不满意，同时也容易引起市场紊乱和不法私商乘机压价抢购等现象。
    为了保护棉农利益和做好今年新棉收购工作，棉区合作社必须在当地党委领导下，迅速展开并大力加强对棉花价格政策的宣传工作，特别是对季节差价的宣传工作，必须做到使棉农家喻户晓。
    在对一般棉农群众进行季节差价的宣传时，应该首先肯定棉农几年来对国家的贡献，加强爱国主义教育，来启发他们支援祖国建设的光荣感，同时也要着重指出几年来棉农的生产发展是和政府的支持与协助分不开的，然后说明今年国家规定季节差价的重要意义。
    首先应该说明：在我们的国家中，棉花季节差价的规定，与旧中国的所谓“季节差价”根本不同。在旧中国，国民经济命脉操纵在帝国主义、封建地主、官僚资本手里，当新棉上市季节，这些剥削者即利用农民急于出售以交租还债的困难，杀价收购，掠夺农民；等到棉花淡季到来，又疯狂抬价，图取暴利。当时的所谓“季节差价”，曾高达百分之三十至六十，以陕西省棉价为例，一九三七年六月至九月，每担棉花值“法币”四十五元六角七分，至同年十月新棉大量上市，每担棉花价格则惨跌到“法币”二十三元六角七分。该省渭南棉区，一九三六年四月至八月，每斤棉花可换七斤四两左右小麦，但到同年新花上市后的九月，一斤棉花仅能换到四斤九两小麦，一月之间，棉价相差百分之五十八。显然，当时的季节差价只是有利于少数剥削者，广大棉农则饱受其剥削，这种残酷剥削在人民的中国是决不能允许的。我们现在制订的季节差价，是根据棉花在初登场时水分较多，以后逐渐干燥；在储存保管中，还需要支出必要的损耗、利息和保管费用等。因此，规定在棉花上市初期，收购价格稍低一些，以后适当地逐渐提高，以补偿棉农在存储待售期间的损耗和费用，这是完全合理和必要的。
    其次，应该说明：合理的季节差价对国家、合作社、农民都有利。过去三年，国家没有规定棉花季节差价，是与国家当时棉花的生产、收购情况分不开的。当时在生产上，棉田种植面积尚小，棉花产量不大；在收购上，由于奸商和投机牟利分子抢购囤积，造成棉价波动，有些棉农则产生了待价惜售的思想，因此，使国家收购计划不能按时完成，使国家掌握的棉花不能及时满足纺织工业和民用絮棉的需要。但是，几年来，在人民政府采取对发展棉花生产极为有利的价格政策和其他增产措施的指导下，在棉农积极增加生产的努力下，加以国营商业和合作社努力组织收购，棉花的生产、收购和需要脱节的情况已有了基本改变。因此，今年规定棉花季节差价，就成为切合时宜的必要措施，这对国家来说，可以有步骤地正常地收购棉花，并保证棉纺织工业和民用絮棉的需要；对合作社来说，可避免忙乱，减少仓储、保管等方面的困难，并且可以做到合理地调剂生产资料和生活资料的供应，对棉农来说，可避免出售时排队拥挤，浪费生产时间，并且，慢慢出售，在价格上不会吃亏，且稍有利。
    再其次，要用算细账的办法，把实行季节差价后，对先少售后多售的棉农有利的道理讲清楚，使棉农能将一部分不急于出售的棉花留到十一、十二月份再卖。但在算细账进行宣传时，必须按照当地实际情况出发，实事求是，既不要夸大，也不要缩小。这一点是很重要的。
    最后，在向棉农进行宣传时，应向棉农反复说明：棉花是国家发展工业的主要原料，现在要求棉农按国家计划出售棉花，并不是国家不收购棉花，恰恰相反，国家和合作社是保证定期按计划收购的。因此，应唤起农民主要是贫苦农民和一部分中农警惕奸商和投机牟利分子的投机取巧行为，防止他们利用调价前或农民急于出售的困难时机乘机低价套购。
    各地合作社基层干部在宣传季节差价和贯彻有计划的收棉方针时，要防止放弃领导和强迫命令两种倾向。一方面，一定要耐心地向棉农说明国家今年收购棉花的方针，组织棉农有计划地售棉；另一方面，必须防止急躁情绪，如果在动员棉农群众从容售棉工作中，稍有急躁情绪，就会强迫命令，把好事办成坏事。另外，产棉区各财经部门，应加强收购与供应的组织工作。如通过召开小型物资交流会等方式，积极准备物资，并扩大工业品和土、特产品的供应，以满足棉农的实际需要。在收购中，应优先照顾有困难农民的出售要求，必要时，应办理“存棉”业务以解决棉农保管上和出售上的困难。
