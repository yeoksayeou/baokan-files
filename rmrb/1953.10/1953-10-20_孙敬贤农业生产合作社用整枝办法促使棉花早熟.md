    Sun Jingxian Agricultural Production Cooperative Uses Pruning Methods to Promote Early Cotton Maturity
    Reader Shouren writes: The cotton fields of the Sun Jingxian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sunzhuang Village, Beizhai Township, Handan County, Hebei Province, began picking cotton in mid-September. Twenty-five mu of cotton fields, severely affected by aphids, had not yet opened their cotton bolls. The cooperative members were saying that these cotton fields would definitely have to pick "red cotton" (frost-bitten cotton). Sun Baoshan, the Party General Branch Secretary of Beizhai Township, introduced the pruning method to promote early cotton maturity to Sun Jingxian, the cooperative director. However, many cooperative members were ideologically opposed to it. Some said, "The season is so late, pruning won't do any good, it's a waste of effort." Others said, "We've only heard of pruning in the hot season, who has ever heard of pruning at this time? We are so busy with the autumn harvest and planting wheat, let's not prune, let's just pick some frost-bitten cotton." Sun Jingxian then explained to everyone, "Removing the branches and leaves will not only provide ventilation but also allow the sunlight to reach the cotton bolls, which will surely make them open earlier. More high-quality cotton can be harvested after pruning, providing more raw materials for our country's textile factories, and also increase our own income." Sun Baoshan also used the example of a late-blooming cotton field in Nanbu Village last year, which opened earlier after pruning in the autumn, to educate everyone. After their explanation, most of the cooperative members agreed to give it a try. The Handan Special District Farm sent a technician to the field to teach the cooperative members the technique of using scissors and sickles to remove crazy branches, empty branches, terminal buds, and diseased leaves. Four male cooperative members and six female cooperative members completed the pruning of the twenty-five mu of cotton fields in only six workdays. To prove that pruning could promote early cotton maturity, they also deliberately left more than one fen of cotton field unpruned. After a few days, an inspection revealed that five-thirds of the cotton plants in the pruned cotton fields had bloomed; in the unpruned area, only one-fifth of the cotton plants had bloomed. This fact educated the cooperative members who did not believe that pruning could promote early cotton maturity. Sun Jingru said, "If I had known it was so effective, I would have started earlier." Other farmers in Sunzhuang Village also began to learn the cooperative's pruning methods one after another.

    孙敬贤农业生产合作社用整枝办法促使棉花早熟
    读者守仁来信：河北省邯郸县北寨乡孙庄村孙敬贤农业生产合作社的棉田在九月中旬开始摘花，有二十五亩受蚜害较重的棉田，棉桃还没开放。社员们都说，这些棉田一定要摘红花（霜后花）啦。北寨乡党总支书记孙宝善就给社长孙敬贤介绍促使棉花早熟的整枝办法。可是，许多社员思想都闹不通。有的说：“季节这样晚啦，整了枝也使不上劲，白费工。”有的说：“只听说伏天整枝，谁听说这时还整枝。秋收种麦这样忙，咱别整了，拾些霜后花算了。”孙敬贤就向大家解释：“去掉枝枝叶叶，既通风，又使阳光晒着棉桃，准能早开花。整枝后多收了好花，多供给咱国家的纺织厂原料，自己也能增加收入。”孙宝善也用去年南堡村一块晚花，秋天整了枝就早开花的事实来教育大家。他俩这样一说，大部分社员都同意试试看。邯郸专区农场派了一位技术员到地里教社员们用剪刀、镰刀去掉疯枝、空枝、群尖和病叶的技术。四位男社员、六位女社员只六晌就把二十五亩棉田整理完了。为了证明整枝能促进棉花早熟，他们还特别留下了一分多地不整枝的棉花。隔了几天，一检查，整过枝的棉田有五分之三的棉棵开了花；没整枝的那一片地，才开了五分之一的棉花。这件事实教育了不相信整枝能促使棉花早熟的社员们。孙敬如说：“早知这样灵，真不如早下手。”孙庄村的其他农民看到后也纷纷学习合作社整枝的办法。
