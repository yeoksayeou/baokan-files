Liaoxi Province State-Owned Commerce and Cooperatives Closely
	Cooperate to Exceed Monthly Commodity Sales Plans
	China Department Store Company of Liaoxi Province and its affiliated Tieling, Jinxi, Changtu, Heishan, Siping, Fuxin, Faku, Beizhen and other department stores closely cooperated with local cooperatives to expand sales and meet the needs of the people, exceeding the sales plan.
	Under the correct leadership of the local Party and government organs and the active efforts of all employees, the China Department Store Company of Liaoxi Province and its affiliated stores have seen a monthly increase in the proportion of sales through cooperatives, thus completing and exceeding the sales plan month by month. In July, the average monthly sales plan was exceeded by 2.1 percent, in August, the monthly sales plan was exceeded by 4.2 percent, and on September 24, the third quarter national sales plan was exceeded by 1.1 percent six days ahead of schedule. The average proportion of sales through cooperatives for the three months accounted for 47 percent, generally meeting the needs of the people.
	In terms of strengthening the links between state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives, the Liaoxi Provincial Company first strengthened ideological education for all employees, corrected the erroneous views of some employees on cooperatives, and established the idea of relying on cooperatives to do a good job in supply. Some people changed their past attitude of "it doesn't matter if we can't sell, we have goods in stock" and took the initiative to contact cooperatives to deliver goods. For example, the Sanjiangkou Department Store took the initiative to select goods for the cooperative and helped with packaging and loading. The Jinxi Hongluoxian Department Store changed the past complicated pick-up procedures, allowing the cooperative to quickly pick up goods. Salesman Jing Guilin said, "It is not easy for the cooperative to make a trip with the car and people, we cannot let them go back empty-handed even if we don't rest." In this way, the cooperative selected more than 100 million yuan worth of goods on a public holiday. After strengthening contact with cooperatives, the department store company and its affiliated stores learned more about the opinions of the vast number of consumers through the cooperatives. For example, the Tieling State-owned Department Store organized grassroots cooperative directors, purchasing agents, and salespersons to visit the state-owned company's warehouse, the Sanjiangkou Department Store held a supply meeting for grassroots cooperatives in the supply area, and other stores in Heishan, Xinlitun, Jinxi, Beizhen, etc. also organized salespersons to go deep into the grassroots cooperatives with "department store commodity catalogs and samples" to understand the situation. Some salespersons from the Jinzhou Department Store also visited nearby neighbors after returning home to solicit their opinions on the commodity supply of state-owned companies and cooperatives. In short, they conducted in-depth investigations in the organization of goods, studied business, and widely listened to the opinions of cooperatives and the people. The leadership drew on strong cadres to actively organize sources of goods, process, order goods, and improve the specifications and quality of goods. Therefore, they timely grasped a sufficient supply of goods suitable for the needs of the masses, guided production, and met the needs of consumers.
	Through the supply of goods to the people through cooperatives, the department store system stores often helped cooperatives improve their business. Salesmen from the Siping Department Store Wholesale Station often went to cooperatives to help arrange shelves and improve supply and sales. The Changbei County Department Store Wholesale Store drew on strong cadres to go to the grassroots cooperatives to specifically help formulate plans. The Jinxi Hongluoxian Department Store helped the cooperative change the original method of the central cooperative uniformly requesting goods and then distributing them to the grassroots cooperatives to a method where the grassroots cooperatives directly went to the state-owned company's warehouse to view and pick up goods, accelerating the turnover of the cooperative's funds and goods. Therefore, the proportion of sales through cooperatives also increased from 60 percent in June to 78.7 percent in July. When the Heishan Department Store saw that the Daheishan Cooperative failed to complete its sales plan, it took the initiative to send experienced cadres to conduct inspections, discovered the shortcomings of blindly purchasing goods and improper pick-up methods, and immediately helped them re-formulate plans. It changed the shortcoming of the purchasing agent blindly purchasing goods without asking about sales, and the salesperson directly went to the state-owned company's warehouse to view goods, requesting more than 70 kinds of goods at once, expanding the supply, and further strengthening the relationship between state-owned commerce and cooperatives and the people, establishing a higher prestige for state-owned commerce, and expanding the universal supply to the people.
	At present, the Liaoxi Provincial Department Store Company and its affiliated stores have prepared a large amount of seasonal goods, and on the basis of combining with cooperatives, they are expanding the supply of industrial products in cooperation with the state's grain purchase tasks.

### 辽西省国营商业和合作社密切  配合逐月超额完成商品销售计划

    辽西省国营商业和合作社密切
    配合逐月超额完成商品销售计划
    中国百货公司辽西省公司及所属铁岭、锦西、昌图、黑山、四平、阜新、法库、北镇等百货商店与当地合作社密切配合，扩大推销，满足了人民的需要，超额完成了销售计划。
    中国百货公司辽西省公司及所属商店在当地党、政机关的正确领导，全体职工积极努力下，通过合作社的销货比重月月上升，因而逐月完成和超额完成销售计划，七月份平均超额完成月销售计划百分之二点一，八月份超额完成月销售计划百分之四点二，九月二十四日提前六天超额完成第三季度国家销售计划百分之一点一，三个月通过合作社销货平均比重则占百分之四十七，普遍满足了人民的需要。
    在密切国营商业部门与合作社的联系方面，辽西省公司首先加强了对全体职工的思想教育，纠正了部分职工对合作社的错误看法，树立了依靠合作社做好供应工作的思想，一些人改变了过去的“卖不了有货在”的态度，主动向合作社联系送货。如三江口百货商店主动替合作社挑选商品，帮助包装、装车。锦西虹螺岘百货商店改变过去复杂的取货手续，使合作社很快能取到货物，营业员荆桂林说：“合作社连车带人来一趟不容易，我们不休息也不能让他们空车回去。”就这样在一个公休假日让合作社挑选了一亿多元的商品。百货公司及所属商店加强与合作社联系后，更通过合作社了解广大消费者的意见。像铁岭国营百货商店组织基层社主任、采购员、营业员参观国营公司仓库，三江口百货商店召开供应区内基层合作社供应会议，其他黑山、新立屯、锦西、北镇等商店也都组织营业员带着“百货商品目录、样品”深入基层合作社了解情况。锦州百货商店的部分营业员回家后也访问了附近的邻居，征求他们对国营公司及合作社在商品供应上的意见。总之，他们在组织货源中深入调查，钻研业务，广泛地听取了合作社及人民群众的意见，领导方面抽调了有力干部积极组织货源，加工、订货、改进商品规格质量，因此，适时地掌握了充分适合群众需要的货源，指导了生产，满足了消费者的需要。
    通过合作社对人民群众的供应，百货公司系统的商店经常帮助合作社改进业务。四平百货批发站业务员经常去合作社帮助摆货架，搞好供销。昌北县百货批发商店抽调有力干部到基层合作社具体帮助制订计划。锦西虹螺岘百货商店帮助合作社把原由中心社统一要货然后再分拨基层社的办法，改变为基层社直接到国营公司仓库看货取货的办法，加速了合作社的资金和商品的流转。因此，通过合作社的销货比重也由六月份的百分之六十上升到七月份的百分之七十八点七。黑山百货商店见大黑山合作社完不成销货计划就主动派有经验的干部去进行检查，发现了进货盲目及取货方法不当的缺点，即帮助他们重新制订计划，改变了采购员不问销售盲目进货的缺点，由营业员直接到国营公司仓库看货，一次就要了七十多种商品，扩大了供应，进一步密切了国营商业与合作社和人民之间的关系，给国营商业树立了更高的威信。并扩大了对人民群众的普遍供应。
    目前辽西省百货公司及所属商店，已准备大宗季节商品，在与合作社结合的基础上，配合国家的购粮任务，扩大工业品的供应。
