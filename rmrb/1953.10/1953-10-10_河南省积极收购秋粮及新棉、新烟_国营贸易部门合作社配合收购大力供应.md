Henan Province Actively Purchases Autumn Grain, New Cotton, and New Tobacco; State-Owned Trading Departments and Cooperatives Cooperate in Purchasing and Vigorously Supplying

    The amount of new cotton, new tobacco, and autumn grain entering the market in Henan Province is increasing daily. An'yang, Zhengzhou, Taikang, and other places have begun purchasing new cotton. To conscientiously implement policies and complete this year's cotton purchase tasks, relevant departments in Henan Province have trained cotton purchasing staff and made full preparations for the safe storage of cotton. The Henan Provincial Finance and Economics Committee has also instructed all localities to conscientiously implement cotton purchase and inspection policies, and thoroughly correct the erroneous behaviors of some units last year in cotton purchasing, such as suppressing grades and prices, and adding impurities, which violated the interests of the state and cotton farmers. Currently, the important issue is that all localities must conscientiously publicize and implement the 1953 to 1954 cotton seasonal price differences, grasp the market, and conduct purchases in a planned manner.

    Regarding the autumn grain purchase work in Henan Province, by August, the cooperatives in the three special districts of Luoyang, Xuchang, and Nanyang alone had purchased more than 4 million jin of sorghum, corn, millet, beans, etc. In order to continue deeply implementing wheat purchases, vigorously developing autumn grain purchases, and doing a good job in supply, the Henan Provincial Grain Bureau has also held a grain work conference, summarized the experience of wheat purchases, further enhanced policy thinking, and formulated a 1953 grain supply plan.

    This year, the purchase of new tobacco is based on new grading standards, that is, according to the position, quality, and color of the tobacco leaves, it is divided into seven grades of golden yellow, five grades of reddish yellow, and four grades of greenish yellow, implementing a policy of high prices for high grades. The implementation of the new grading method has increased the average price of each jin of tobacco leaves by 400 to 500 yuan compared to last year, which is very satisfying to tobacco farmers. After the tobacco leaves in Xuchang Special District entered the market, state-owned trading departments and cooperatives are vigorously purchasing them.

    In order to strengthen the supply of production and living materials to farmers during the busy autumn harvest season, the provincial trade and cooperative departments have vigorously opened up local sources of goods. Since the provincial department store company held a supply conference in late July, the Luoyang Department Store Wholesale Station, based on the principle of determining sales by production and adapting to local conditions, has actively organized local sources of goods. The planned preliminary processing, ordering, and purchasing of striped cloth, soap, umbrellas, scarves, toothbrushes, etc., exceeds six times the actual performance completed in July, basically completing the original task assigned by the provincial department store company for the second half of the year. According to preliminary statistics from cooperatives in nine special districts across the province, it is planned to supply 112.38 million jin of fertilizer, 26,206 step plows, 2.1 million small farm tools, and 1.92 million jin of pesticides during the three autumn harvests. The Qi County Cooperative also organized blacksmiths and carpenters to go to the countryside to process and repair farm tools for farmers. The Shangqiu City Cooperative obtained 2 million jin of manure locally to supply to farmers, which is sufficient for autumn planting needs. At the same time, many regional cooperatives have signed combination contracts with farmers. For example, six districts in Tangyin have signed 127 combination contracts, 132 general contracts, and 45 agreements, with a total value of more than 7.2 billion yuan. (Lü Jianzhong)

    河南省积极收购秋粮及新棉、新烟
    国营贸易部门合作社配合收购大力供应
    河南省新棉、新烟及秋粮上市量日益上升。安阳、郑州、太康等地开始收购新棉。为认真贯彻政策，完成今年棉花收购任务，河南省有关部门对收棉工作人员曾进行了训练，对收存棉花的安全设备也都作了充分准备，河南省财政经济委员会并指示各地切实贯彻棉花收购及检验政策，彻底纠正去年某些单位在收购棉花中的压级压价、掺假掺杂等违犯国家和棉农利益的错误行为。目前重要的问题是各地须认真宣传与贯彻一九五三年到一九五四年的棉花季节差价，掌握市场，有计划地进行收购。
    河南省的秋粮收购工作，到八月止，仅洛阳、许昌、南阳三个专区合作社即收购高粱、玉米、小米、豆子等四百多万斤。为继续深入贯彻小麦收购和大力开展秋粮收购，并作好供应工作，河南省人民政府粮食厅也已召开了粮食工作会议，总结了小麦收购工作经验，进一步提高了政策思想，并制订了一九五三年粮食供应方案。
    收购新烟，今年是按新的等级标准，即按照烟叶的部位、品质、颜色分为黄金七级、赤黄五级、青黄四级，贯彻优级优价政策，新分级法的实行，每斤烟叶平均价格比去年提高了四、五百元，烟农十分满意。许昌专区烟叶上市后，国营贸易部门和合作社正大力收购。
    为加强秋收旺季对农民生产、生活资料的供应，省贸易、合作部门大力开辟了地方货源，洛阳百货批发站自七月下旬省百货公司召开供应会议以后，根据以产定销、因地制宜的原则，积极组织地方货源，计划初步加工、订货和收购的条布、肥皂、雨伞、纱巾、牙刷等，超过七月份完成实绩的六倍，基本完成省百货公司原分配的下半年任务。据全省九个专区合作社的初步统计，计划在三秋生产中供应肥料一亿一千二百三十八万斤，步犁二万六千二百零六张，小型农具等二百一十万件，农药一百九十二万斤。淇县社并组织了铁匠、木匠下乡为农民加工修补农具。商邱市社就地取材，筹得二百万斤大粪供给农民，足够秋种所需。同时不少地区合作社与农民订立了结合合同，如汤阴六个区已订结合合同一百二十七件，一般合同一百三十二件，协议四十五件，总值达七十二亿多元。（吕建中）
