    Universally Promote Segmented Parallel Flow Operation Method
    Construction Progresses Rapidly at Various Basic Construction Sites in Harbin
    The campaign to increase production and practice economy at various basic construction sites in Harbin has become a mass movement. Construction units have further improved their construction management, especially in aspects such as operation plans, technical responsibility systems, and single-project responsibility systems. Various advanced experiences, especially the segmented parallel flow operation method, have been universally promoted at 46 larger construction sites throughout the city. Some construction sites have even seen new developments and innovations. For example, the Harbin Vehicle Repair Factory construction site has created a three-dimensional parallel rapid construction method. Units such as the Harbin Institute of Technology construction site are implementing the three-dimensional parallel rapid construction method, enabling projects spanning multiple years to be completed this year. Municipal-level leading departments have inspected key projects in turn, reversing the tendency to neglect quality that arose in a few construction sites during the initial stages of the campaign to increase production and practice economy. The quality of construction has gradually improved, accidents have gradually decreased, and construction progress has significantly advanced. The average daily progress in early September was around 0.5% of the annual target, around 0.8% in mid-September, and reached over 1% in late September, doubling the rate of early September. As of the end of September, the city's cumulative progress was 70.88% of the annual target, with key projects at 70.27%. However, due to the accelerated construction progress and the impending completion of projects, a slackening of effort has begun to emerge among some cadres at many construction sites. Some cadres believe that "the danger of spanning years has passed, it's time to rest," while others feel that the projects are almost finished and are unwilling to continue working hard and intensely on-site. Cadres and workers from within the passes and rural areas are preparing to return home. As a result, a sense of relaxation has appeared at many construction sites. In order to overcome this slackening and strive for complete victory, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an emergency meeting of basic construction cadres on the 13th of this month, deciding to take the following measures: First, quickly mobilize all employees to continue the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and strive for the complete and victorious completion of this year's basic construction tasks. Second, all companies and construction sites should quickly formulate operation plans for the final and complete completion, and further strengthen education on "quality first." Third, further improve work on winter protection at construction sites. Fourth, do a good job in balancing materials and labor, with completed construction sites supporting uncompleted ones to ensure supply. Fifth, continue to strengthen leadership over construction sites, and cadres should not be transferred at will. To ensure the implementation of the above measures, members of the Municipal Committee and responsible cadres from various departments formed ten inspection teams to go deep into key construction sites to conduct inspections and provide assistance, reversing the slackening of effort. By the 16th, all construction sites in the city, except for a few, had mobilized from top to bottom, made specific completion plans, and had begun to act urgently according to the plans.

    普遍推广分段平行流水作业法
    哈尔滨各基本建设工地工程进展很快
    哈尔滨市各基本建设工地增产节约竞赛已形成群众性的运动。各施工单位在施工管理，尤其是作业计划及技术责任制和单项工程专责制等方面有了进一步的改善；各种先进经验，尤其是分段平行流水作业法，在全市较大的四十六个工地已普遍推广，有的工地并有新的发展与创造，如哈尔滨车辆修理工厂工地创造了立体平行快速施工法。哈尔滨工业大学工地等单位推行立体平行快速施工法，使跨年度工程可在今年完工。市级领导部门对重点工程依次作了检查，扭转了少数工地在增产节约竞赛初期所产生的忽视质量的偏向，工程质量已逐步提高，事故已逐渐减少，工程进度有显著进展。九月上旬平均日进度为全年任务的百分之零点五左右，中旬为百分之零点八左右，而下旬已达百分之一以上，较上旬加速一倍。截至九月底统计，全市累计进度为全年任务的百分之七十点八八，重点工程为百分之七十点二七。但由于工程进度加速，工程结束在即，不少工地部分干部中开始滋长着松劲思想，有的干部认为“跨年度危险过去了，该休息一下了”；有的干部认为工程快完了，于是不愿继续深入现场作坚苦紧张的工作；关内与农村来的干部和工人则准备回家。因此许多工地出现了松弛现象。为克服松劲思想，争取全面胜利，中共哈尔滨市委于本月十三日召开了基本建设干部紧急大会，决定采取以下几项措施：一、迅速动员全体职工继续开展增产节约竞赛，为全面胜利地完成今年基本建设任务而奋斗；二、各公司与工地均应迅速制订最后全面完工的作业计划，进一步加强“质量第一”的教育；三、进一步做好工地防寒等工作；四、做好材料与劳动力的平衡工作，已完工的工地支援未完工的工地，保证供应；五、继续加强对工地的领导，工地干部不得随意抽调。为保证上述措施的实现，市委委员及各部门负责干部组成了十个检查小组，深入各重点工地进行检查帮助，扭转松劲思想。至十六日，全市除个别工地外，所有工地都从上而下进行了动员，作了具体的竣工计划，并已根据计划紧张地行动起来。
