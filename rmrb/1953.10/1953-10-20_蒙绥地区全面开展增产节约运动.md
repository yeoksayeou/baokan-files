    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan Province have comprehensively launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy.

    After farmers of all ethnic groups in the eastern agricultural and semi-agricultural, semi-pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia initiated the patriotic campaign to increase production and practice economy in mid-September, agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various places have formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy. The Eastern District Administrative Office also plans to mobilize the vast numbers of women and children to glean the crops lost in the fields during harvesting. If each hectare yields an additional one dou of grain, the entire district can increase grain production by 22,000 tons. In the increase production and practice economy campaign, farmers in Suiyuan Province are actively plowing the land in conjunction with autumn harvesting. Currently, the average autumn plowing in the province has completed 60 percent. Some mutual aid teams have also applied base fertilizer in the fields. In addition, in order to avoid natural disasters during the autumn harvest, farmers throughout the province have launched a rush harvesting campaign. For example, farmers in the Hetou area of Baotou County began harvesting at the end of August, enabling them to harvest more than 10,000 mu of crops before the river surged in mid-September.

    State-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in Suiyuan Province, as well as basic construction sites in Guisui and Baotou, have successively launched labor emulation drives since late September, achieving significant results. Due to the enthusiastic construction workers, 90 percent of the province's basic construction projects have been completed. Many factories and mines have overcome chaotic phenomena in the competition, formulated daily and ten-day work plans, and new records are constantly emerging. Local state-owned factories and mines in Inner Mongolia have also formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy. The Industry Department of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has specially dispatched cadres to key factories and mines to assist in solving the main problems in increasing production and practicing economy. The CCP Hailar Municipal Committee convened an advanced experience exchange conference in mid-October to summarize experience in a timely manner and promote competition.

    Now that the peak season for material exchange has arrived, the trade and cooperative departments in Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan are actively taking effective measures to complete the plan to increase production and practice economy. The Suiyuan Provincial Department Store and the Cooperative Federation are continuously transferring large quantities of general merchandise, cloth, and cotton to Guisui City for supply. Primary material exchange fairs have been held successively in the pastoral areas of Hulunbuir League in Inner Mongolia and in various parts of Suiyuan Province. (Xinhua News Agency)

    蒙绥地区全面开展增产节约运动
    内蒙古自治区和绥远省全面开展增产节约运动。
    内蒙古东部农业区、半农半牧区的各族农民，九月中旬发起爱国增产节约运动后，各地农业生产合作社和互助组都订出增产节约计划。东部区行政公署并计划发动广大妇女和儿童拣拾在收割中丢落在田间的庄稼，如每垧地增产一斗粮食，全区就可增产粮食二万二千吨。绥远全省农民在增产节约运动中，结合秋收工作积极翻地，目前全省秋翻地平均已完成了百分之六十。有的互助组并在地里施了底肥。此外，全省农民在秋收中为了避免自然灾害侵袭，展开了抢收运动。如包头县河头地区的农民，在八月底即开始收割，使一万多亩庄稼在九月中旬河水猛涨前抢收完毕。
    绥远省各国营及地方国营厂矿和归绥、包头两市基本建设工地，九月下旬先后展开劳动竞赛，已取得显著成绩。由于建筑工人热情蓬勃，全省基本建设工程已完成了百分之九十。许多厂矿在竞赛中克服了混乱现象，制订了日、旬作业计划，新纪录不断出现。内蒙古各地地方国营厂矿也订出增产节约计划。内蒙古自治区人民政府工业部特派出干部到各重点厂矿，协助解决增产节约中的主要问题。中共海拉尔市委员会在十月中旬召开先进经验交流大会，及时总结经验，推动竞赛。
    现在，物资交流旺季已经到来。内蒙古、绥远两地贸易、合作部门正积极采取有效措施，以完成增产节约的计划。绥远省百货公司及合作总社正源源调运大批百货、布匹、棉花到归绥市供应。在内蒙古呼纳盟牧区及绥远省各地，已先后召开了初级物资交流会。（新华社）
