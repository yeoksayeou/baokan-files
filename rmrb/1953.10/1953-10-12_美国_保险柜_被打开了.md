    The American "Safe" Has Been Opened
    Cai Yin
    There is an old Chinese story about a miserly and foolish hoarder who had a chest full of jewels and jade. The chest was locked, and he carried the key with him. This hoarder believed his lock was very strong, and only his key could open it. One day, the chest suddenly disappeared. This shocked him, but he still pinned his hopes on his lock and key. He thought: the key is in my hand, the lock cannot be opened, and the contents of the chest will eventually be mine. However, things did not turn out as he thought; the chest never came back.
    Today, when we tell this story, people will certainly feel that the American aggressors, who have always conspired to forcibly detain prisoners of war and are now trying every possible means to obstruct the explanation work for the prisoners of war, are too much like this miserly and foolish hoarder. In order to achieve the goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, the American aggressors conducted a cruel "screening" of our captured personnel, and forcibly attached labels of "unwilling to be repatriated" and "preferring suicide to returning home" to them. The American aggressors were confident that they had locked these prisoners of war in a very strong box—prisoner of war camps surrounded by layers of barbed wire and bunkers, locked with locks upon locks—fingerprints, tattoos, special agent control, news blockade, deceptive propaganda… For the American aggressors, this was no longer a medieval wooden chest, but a "steel safe" of the highly developed capitalist era. Therefore, the American aggressors were even more convinced of the reliability of their "safe."
    As everyone knows, when the American aggressors had to transport the captured Korean and Chinese personnel from Jeju Island, Geoje Island, and Busan to the demilitarized zone, to be guarded by the Indian Custodial Forces under the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, in accordance with the Korean Armistice Agreement, the American aggressors became even more rigorous in controlling and blocking their "safe." They not only preserved the special agent organizations in the U.S. prisoner of war camps intact, but also continuously sent large numbers of special agents into the camps. The American-Chiang Kai-shek special agents forced the prisoners of war to form mutual guarantee groups of three to five people. If one person was repatriated, the others would be severely punished. Each American-Chiang Kai-shek special agent controlled at least six prisoners of war. The special agents also secretly established a "General Staff" in the camps, under which there were "Garrison Teams" and "Special Agent Teams." They actually turned the hospitals in the camps into command posts and liaison stations for instigating riots. They used flag signals and signals in the camps to maintain contact with the U.S. military and the Rhee Syngman puppet army outside. They smuggled radio receivers into the camps, receiving instructions for sabotaging the explanation work directly from Tokyo and Seoul. The special agents tore up the prisoners of war's name and number cards and mixed into the camps with the prisoners of war. They brought wolves, dogs, and various weapons into the camps, including knives, wooden sticks, flagpoles and crutches prepared to be used as clubs, leather shoes with steel knives hidden in the soles… All of this shows that the twentieth-century Americans are indeed much more "clever" than the methods used by the medieval hoarders.
    However, the fact that more than one hundred and ten of our captured personnel broke through special agent control and were repatriated has already opened a gap in the American "safe." The prisoners of war, risking being cut and gouged out by the special agents, risking being beaten and shot by the special agents, successively broke through special agent control, crossed the barbed wire, and expressed their willingness to be repatriated to the Indian Custodial Forces. Volunteer soldier Zhang Shiying, although closely followed by five Chiang Kai-shek bandits, still tried every means to request repatriation. Another volunteer soldier, Huang Lichao, although he witnessed his comrade being killed by Chiang Kai-shek special agents who gouged out his heart, still ran out of the camp, ignoring the threats and intimidation of the special agents, to request repatriation. According to Yu Fuxin, a recently repatriated captured Korean People's Army soldier, "In their camp, besides the special agents, the vast majority of people are eager for the explanation work to begin so that they can have the opportunity to go home." These facts prove that no matter what kind of American "steel safe" it is, it is not safe.
    The secrets in the American "safe" are about to be fully exposed. At present, the U.S. side is doing its utmost to obstruct and sabotage the explanation work. On the one hand, the U.S. side is repeatedly delaying the construction of the explanation camps; on the other hand, it opposes extending the explanation period. At the same time, the U.S. side is stubbornly and unreasonably obstructing and sabotaging the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Hamblen and Clark have attacked the "Regulations for Explanation and Interview Work" and the announcement letter to the prisoners of war published by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission; Dulles is also "unhappy" with the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission; and the Rhee Syngman gang is constantly clamoring to "take up arms to deal with" the Indian Custodial Forces; the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits in Taiwan are also issuing a barrage of attacks on India. What are all these attacks, clamors, and noises for? It is because the "Regulations for Explanation and Interview Work" published by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in accordance with its "Terms of Reference" stipulate that the explanation representatives can conduct individual explanations and interviews with the prisoners of war, and that every prisoner of war should attend the explanations and interviews, so that the prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their free right to request repatriation. Undoubtedly, the "Regulations for Explanation and Interview Work" is a real key to open the American "safe." And the smooth progress of individual explanation and interview work means the complete bankruptcy of the American aggressors' lie that the prisoners of war "refuse repatriation." Therefore, the American aggressors, who have always chanted "respect for the individual will and rights of prisoners of war," have now suddenly issued the fallacies of "collective interviews" and the right of prisoners of war to "collectively refuse explanation." The U.S. side is attempting to use its special agents lurking in the camps to control the prisoners of war, making the explanation work impossible.
    Although the American "safe" has in fact gone bankrupt, it, like the hoarder in the previous story, still foolishly believes that the key is still in its hands. Clark, in his letter to Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, on October 6, still said that the prisoners of war had long ago "voluntarily" decided to "refuse repatriation," and that "as long as there is no force or coercion, the vast majority of prisoners of war will insist on their decision." At the same time, the Rhee Syngman and Chiang Kai-shek gangs, with the support of the American aggressors, are plotting a conspiracy to "make all the prisoners of war under Indian custody escape collectively." According to the British "Daily Telegraph" on October 5, such a plan has been drawn up and it said that "this matter will probably happen in the next few days." People cannot help but ask: Since Clark said that the prisoners of war had long ago "voluntarily" decided to "refuse repatriation," why have more than one hundred and ten of our captured personnel broken through special agent control to request repatriation today? Since Clark opposes the use of "force and coercion" to treat prisoners of war, why is the U.S. side instructing the Rhee Syngman and Chiang Kai-shek gangs to step up the planning of a conspiracy for the prisoners of war to "escape collectively"? The facts are irrefutably proving that no matter how deliberately the American aggressors obstruct and sabotage the prisoner of war repatriation work, and no matter how much they believe in the reliability of their "safe," the American "safe" has not only been opened, but is destined to be completely broken.

    美国“保险柜”被打开了
    采因
    中国有一个古老的故事说：一个贪财而愚蠢的守财奴，他有一只藏满珠宝玉器的箱子，箱子上了锁，钥匙带在自己身边。这个守财奴相信自己的锁很牢固，而且只有自己的钥匙才能打开。一天，忽然箱子不见了。这使他大吃一惊，可是他仍然把希望放在他的锁和钥匙上。他想：钥匙在自己手里，锁是打不开的，箱子里的东西终久还是自己的。然而事情并不像他所想的那样，箱子毕竟是再也不回来了。
    今天当我们讲起这个故事的时候，人们一定会觉得：一向阴谋强迫扣留战俘、如今正千方百计地阻挠对战俘的解释工作的美国侵略者，真和这位贪财而愚蠢的守财奴太相像了。美国侵略者为了要达到强迫扣留战俘的目的，曾对我方被俘人员进行了残酷的“甄别”，并且硬把“不愿遣返”、“宁愿自杀也不愿回家”的封条加在他们身上。美国侵略者满以为把这些战俘关进了一只非常牢固的箱子——围了一层又一层铁丝网和碉堡的战俘营里，锁上加锁——按手印、身上刺字、特务控制、新闻封锁、欺骗宣传……。而这对美国侵略者说来，已不是中世纪的木箱，而是资本主义高度发展时期的“钢制保险柜”了。因此，美国侵略者也就更加相信自己的“保险柜”的可靠性了。
    人们都知道，当美国侵略者不得不按照朝鲜停战协定，而把朝中被俘人员从济州岛、巨济岛和釜山等地运到非军事区，交由中立国遣返委员会属下的印度看管部队看管的时候，美国侵略者就越加对自己的“保险柜”摆布、封锁得严密了。他们不仅把在美方战俘营里的特务组织原封不动地保存着，并且还不断地把大批特务分子派进营场里去。美蒋特务分子强迫战俘们以三人到五人组成一组互相连保，假若有一个人被遣返，其余的人就要受到严厉的处罚。美蒋特务分子每人至少控制六个战俘。特务分子们并且在营场里秘密设立“参谋部”，在“参谋部”之下又设有“警备队”、“特务队”。他们把营场里的医院实际上变成了策动骚乱的司令部和联络站。他们在营场里打旗语、发信号与外面的美军和李伪军保持联系；他们把无线电收音机偷运进营场，直接从东京和汉城得到破坏解释工作的指示。特务们撕毁了战俘们的姓名和编号的卡片，和战俘们一同混进营场里来。他们把狼狗和各种凶器带进营场，里面有小刀、木棍，准备截作木棒用的旗杆和拐杖、鞋底里藏着钢刀的皮鞋……。所有这一切都说明：二十世纪的美国人确乎比中世纪的守财奴所用的方法，是更加“高明”得多了。
    然而，一百一十多名我方被俘人员突破特务控制遣返归来的事实，已经把美国的“保险柜”打开了一个缺口。战俘们冒着被特务分子割肉挖心的危险，冒着被特务分子殴打枪毙的危险，接连突破特务控制，越过铁丝网，纷纷向印度看守部队表示要求遣返的意志。志愿军被俘人员张世英虽然被五个蒋匪特务紧紧跟着，可是他仍然想尽方法要求遣返；另一位志愿军被俘人员黄立超虽然亲眼看到自己的同伴被蒋匪特务挖心杀害，可是他仍然不顾特务分子的恐吓和威胁跑出营场要求遣返。据最近被遣返回来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员余富新说：在他们的“营场里，除了特务之外，绝大多数人是渴望解释工作开始，以便他们能有机会回家。”这些事实都证明：任你什么美国的“钢制保险柜”也是并不保险的。
    美国“保险柜”里的秘密眼看就要全部暴露出来了。目前美方正极力阻挠和破坏解释工作。美方一面一再拖延解释营场的修建；一面又反对顺延解释期限。同时，美方正蛮横无理地阻挠和破坏中立国遣返委员会的工作。汉布伦和克拉克对中立国遣返委员会公布的“解释和访问工作细则”和给战俘们的公告信大肆攻击；杜勒斯对中立国遣返委员会的工作也“感到不愉快”；而李承晚匪帮也正不断叫嚣要“拿起武器来对付”印度看管部队；台湾国民党残余匪帮也发出一片攻击印度的吵嚷。这些攻击、叫嚣、吵嚷都是为了什么呢？那就是因为中立国遣返委员会根据“职权范围”公布的“解释和访问工作细则”规定解释代表可以向战俘进行个别的解释和访问，规定每一个战俘都出席解释和访问，以便使战俘有使用要求遣返的自由权利的机会。无疑地，“解释和访问工作细则”是一把真正能够打开美国“保险柜”的钥匙。而个别解释和访问工作的顺利进行，就意味着美国侵略者说战俘“拒绝遣返”的谎言的彻底破产。因此，一向高唱“尊重战俘个人意志和权利”的美国侵略者，如今忽而又发出“集体访问”和战俘有权“集体拒绝解释”的谬论来了。美方企图这样利用它潜伏在营场里的特务分子控制战俘，使解释工作无法进行。
    美国的“保险柜”虽然事实上已经破产了，但是它和前面故事中的那个守财奴一样，仍然愚蠢地相信钥匙还在自己的手中。克拉克十月六日在写给中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将的信中，仍然说什么战俘早就“自愿”决定了“拒绝遣返”，“只要没有武力和胁迫，绝大多数战俘都将坚持他们的决定。”同时，李承晚和蒋介石匪帮在美国侵略者的支持下，又在策划一个“使所有在印度人看管下的战俘集体逃跑”的阴谋。据十月五日英国“每日电讯报”透露：这样的一个计划已经拟定，并且说“这件事情大概会在今后几天之内发生”。人们不禁要问：克拉克既然说战俘早就“自愿”决定了“拒绝遣返”，为什么到今天已有一百一十多名我方被俘人员突破特务控制要求遣返了呢？既然克拉克反对用“武力和胁迫”对待战俘，为什么美方又指使李承晚和蒋介石匪帮加紧策划战俘“集体逃跑”的阴谋呢？事实在无可辩驳地证明，不管美国侵略者如何处心积虑地阻挠和破坏战俘遣返工作，也不管他怎样相信自己“保险柜”的可靠性，但美国的“保险柜”不但已经被打开了，而且注定是要彻底被打破的。
