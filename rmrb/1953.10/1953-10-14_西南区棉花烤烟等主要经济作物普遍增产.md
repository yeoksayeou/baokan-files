    Major Economic Crops Such as Cotton and Flue-cured Tobacco in the Southwest Region Generally Increase Production
    Several major economic crops in the Southwest region, such as cotton, flue-cured tobacco, blue hemp, and tea, have generally achieved increased production this year. According to preliminary estimates, cotton production increased by about 15% compared to last year; the output of flue-cured tobacco also increased significantly, with Guizhou Province, the main producing area, increasing production by 20% this year compared to last year; tea production increased by 10% compared to last year; and blue hemp production also increased compared to last year. Due to the strengthening of technical guidance in various regions, the quality has improved.
    The strong support from the state to farmers who grow economic crops is the main reason for this year's increased production. In addition to providing large amounts of loans for assistance, governments at all levels have also established technical guidance stations or guidance centers in the main producing areas of various economic crops, providing specific guidance on all technical aspects of increasing production. Cotton farmers in key cotton-producing counties such as Suining, Jianyang, and Santai in Sichuan Province, and Jianshui in Yunnan Province, and Shibing and Sinan in Guizhou Province, generally adopted advanced production experiences and field management techniques such as seed selection, seed soaking, single-plant close planting, topping and pruning, opening drainage ditches, rational fertilization, and pest and disease control, thereby greatly increasing cotton production this year. This year, cotton production in Baoshan Prefecture, Yunnan Province, will increase by 26.8% compared to last year. In terms of flue-cured tobacco and tea, improvements in techniques such as seedling cultivation, planting, picking, baking, and processing, as well as the reclamation of a large amount of wasteland for tea cultivation, have not only increased production but also greatly improved quality. Under the guidance of technical cadres, tobacco farmers in various counties in Guiding Prefecture, Guizhou Province, and Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, improved baking techniques and improved baking fuel, greatly increasing the proportion of upper and middle-grade flue-cured tobacco and significantly reducing the proportion of lower-grade tobacco. In Meitan County, Guizhou Province, first-grade Hong Mao tea accounts for 45%, second-grade accounts for 40%, and grades below second-grade account for only 15%; the export green tea produced in Pingba County in the province this year has all reached first-grade quality, ensuring export specifications. The quality of blue hemp has also improved this year. The blue hemp produced in Dazhu County, Sichuan Province, this year has generally reached export standards.
    State-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in the Southwest region have promptly launched procurement work after the harvest of these economic crops.

    西南区棉花烤烟等主要经济作物普遍增产
    西南区今年棉花、烤烟、青麻、茶叶等几种主要经济作物普遍获得增产。据初步估计，棉花比去年增产约百分之十五；烤烟的产量也增加了许多，主要产地贵州省今年比去年增产百分之二十；茶叶比去年增产百分之十；青麻产量也较去年增加。由于各地加强了技术指导，品质都有所提高。
    国家对种植经济作物的农民给予的大力扶持，是今年获得增产的主要原因。各级人民政府除大量发放贷款加以扶助外，并在各种经济作物的主要产地设立技术指导站或指导所，在增产的各个技术环节上给以具体指导。四川省遂宁、简阳、三台及云南省建水与贵州省施秉、思南等重点产棉县份的棉农一般都接受了选种、浸种、单株密植、摘心整枝、开排水沟、合理施肥、防治病虫害等先进生产经验和田间管理技术，因而今年的棉花产量大为提高。云南省保山专区今年的棉花将比去年增产百分之二十六点八。在烤烟、茶叶方面，由于改进了育苗、种植、采摘、烘烤、制作等技术和垦复了大量荒茶，不但在产量上有所增加，在质量上也大大提高。贵州省贵定专区各县及四川省简阳县烟农在技术干部指导下，改进了烘烤技术，改善了烘烤燃料，使上、中等品质烤烟大大增加，下级烟显著减少。贵州省湄潭县所产的红毛茶一级的占百分之四十五，二级的占百分之四十，二级以下的仅占百分之十五；该省平坝县所制的外销绿茶，今年的品质则全部达到一级，保证了出口规格。青麻的质量今年也有所提高。四川省大竹县今年所产的青麻一般均已达到出口标准。
    西南区国营商业部门和合作社在这些经济作物收获后便及时开展了收购工作。
