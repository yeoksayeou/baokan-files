Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: Béchade, reporter for the Paris "L'Humanité," reported from Panmunjom: The American prediction that riots and bloodshed would occur when explanation work began for the prisoners of war has been thoroughly discredited today. All the prisoners of war from Camp 31, the most tightly organized Chinese prisoner-of-war camp—the headquarters of Kuomintang ringleaders and special agents in all the camps—went to the explanation site and underwent individual explanations. Not a single shot was fired, and no force was used. In the first brief explanation process, ten prisoners of war decided to return home. The explanation work was delayed until the afternoon. Only half of the prisoners of war originally scheduled to hear the explanation today could be processed, and these prisoners only had half the scheduled time for explanation. This morning, General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, tirelessly persuaded the camp special agent ringleaders to allow the prisoners of war to go to the explanation site quietly. When his persuasion was refused, he dispatched a battalion of troops to Camp 31, preparing to bring the prisoners of war out from there. In less than a few minutes, the special agent ringleaders agreed to start the explanation work at 3:30 p.m. in the first group of sixteen tents, and to continue in the second group of tents about an hour later. Because American observers and Kuomintang interpreters in almost every tent violated the regulations, the work was immediately halted. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission then held an emergency meeting. According to the rules, observers and interpreters should not interrupt the work; they must wait until the work is completed before expressing what they want to say. Only personnel from the Neutral Nations Subsidiary Organizations can interrupt the work. However, from the beginning of the explanation work, the Kuomintang interpreters stood up to tell the prisoners of war how to go to Taiwan, questioned the remarks of the explanation personnel, disobeyed the repeated orders of the Indian chairman to sit down, and continued to talk with the prisoners of war. After holding an emergency meeting, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission warned the Americans that if the observers and interpreters violated the rules or disobeyed the chairman again, they would be prohibited from attending the remaining explanation work meetings.

The most disappointed people during today's explanation work were American journalists. After hearing that the special agent ringleaders refused to let the prisoners of war leave the camp and that General Thimayya had issued a final ultimatum to them with noon as the deadline, the American journalists asked to be allowed to go to the scene to "watch the fun." The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission decided not to allow any journalists to enter the site. As a result, ten United Nations journalists—mostly American journalists—launched a vicious personal attack on Lieutenant Colonel Striniwasin, the chief press officer. They said that during the riots and massacres on Geoje Island, journalists were allowed to interview, and they must be allowed to interview this time as well. Three American news agencies competed to insult the news policy of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and India's measures of not allowing journalists to enter when bloody riots and shooting incidents occurred with rude language. Later, Thimayya drove over to tell them that in the first show of force, the special agent ringleaders had bowed their heads and obediently allowed the prisoners of war to come out. There were no shootings or bloody riots. These journalists emitted some unbelieving groans and sighs of regret.

In the hysterical actions of most of the prisoners of war who passed through the explanation tents today, we can see the results of American psychological warfare tactics. They stared with wide eyes, made unnatural loud shouts, posed in ways that Chinese people usually don't, and kept shouting some of the words that had been instilled into their minds day and night for the past two years. In the death camps, if the prisoners of war wanted the whipping and torture to stop, they had to keep shouting these words: "Return to Taiwan. Return to Taiwan." The louder they shouted, the more the American observers smiled at them approvingly. If they stamped their feet or pounded the table again, the American observers would mark a special symbol in their scorebooks. But among these people, there were ten prisoners of war who were also shouting "Return to Taiwan," who, within minutes, abandoned the unnatural masks that each of them had put on and asked to go home.

These ten prisoners of war, after being examined, were immediately handed over to the Korean and Chinese side tonight.

    巴黎“人道报”记者贝却敌报道
    美国观察员和蒋匪译员公然阻挠解释工作
    【新华社十五日讯】巴黎“人道报”贝却敌自板门店报道：美国人预言在向战俘开始进行解释工作时会发生暴动和流血事件，这种预言今天已彻底破产了。有最严密组织的中国战俘营场第三十一号营场——其中有国民党头子并且是各营场的特务分子的大本营——的全体战俘都到了解释场所，并且经过个别的解释，没有发一枪，没有使用一点武力，在第一次短促的解释过程中，就有十个战俘决定回家。解释工作拖到下午才进行。原定今天听取解释的战俘，只有一半可以处理，而且只有一半的时间对这些战俘进行解释。中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军今晨不厌其烦地劝说营场特务头子允许战俘安静地走到解释场所去。当他的劝说遭到拒绝时，他就派遣一营军队到第三十一号营场去，准备把战俘从那边带出来。不到几分钟，特务头子就同意在下午三时三十分在第一组十六个帐篷开始解释工作，约一小时后在第二组帐篷进行解释。由于几乎每一个帐篷内的美国观察员和国民党译员都违反规定，这项工作立刻就停止了，中立国遣返委员会接着举行了紧急会议，按规则，观察员和译员不能打断工作的进行，必须等待工作结束后才能发表要说的话。只有中立国附属机构的人员才能打断工作的进行。但是国民党译员从解释工作开始时起就站起来告诉战俘们如何到台湾去，责问解释人员的谈话，不服从印度主席一再要他们坐下来的命令，而继续和战俘们谈话。中立国遣返委员会在举行紧急会议后，警告美国人说：如果观察员和译员以后再违反规则或不服从主席，就要禁止他们出席其余的解释工作会议。
    在今天的解释工作过程中，最失望的是美国新闻记者。在听说特务头子拒绝让战俘离开营场而蒂迈雅将军已经以中午为限期向他们发出最后通牒之后，美国新闻记者就要求让他们到现场去“看热闹”。中立国遣返委员会决定不让任何记者到场。于是，十个联合国记者——大半是美国记者，就对首席新闻发布官斯特里尼瓦生中校进行恶毒的人身攻击。他们说，在巨济岛暴动和屠杀案期间，记者就曾被允许去采访，这一次也必须允许他们去采访。三个美国通讯社竞相用粗暴的语言侮辱中立国遣返委员会的新闻政策和印度在流血骚乱与开枪事件发生时不让记者进去的措施。后来蒂迈雅驱车前来告诉他们，在第一次的武力表演中，特务头子已经低头屈服，服服贴贴地让战俘出来。并没有发生开枪事件和流血骚乱。这些记者就发出一些不相信的哀鸣和惋惜的叹息。
    在今天从解释帐篷经过的大多数战俘歇斯底里的行动中，我们可以看到美国的心理战伎俩的结果。他们瞪着眼睛，发出不自然的高声叫喊，摆出中国人通常都没有的架势，不停地喊出在过去两年中不分日夜灌输到他们头脑中的一些字眼。在死亡营中，如果战俘们希望鞭打和酷刑停止，就必须不停地喊这些字眼：“回台湾。回台湾。”他们喊得声音愈高，美国观察员就愈对他们微笑表示赞许，如果他们又顿脚或者又拍桌子的话，美国观察员就在他的记分本上记下特别的符号。但是在这些人中间，就有十名同样喊着“回台湾”的战俘在几分钟之内就抛弃了他们每个人所带上的不自然的假面具，要求回家。
    这十名战俘经过审查，就在今天晚上立即移交给朝中方面。
