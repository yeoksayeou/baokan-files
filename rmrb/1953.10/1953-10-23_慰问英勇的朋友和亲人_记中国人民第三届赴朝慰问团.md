Luo Mengshan, the representative of the families of martyrs, said: "Korea is the place where my son shed his blood and sacrificed his life, and every inch of its land is dear to us." The families of martyrs and soldiers had long prepared a bellyful of words to chat with their relatives and friends, sitting on the warm kang, and they will bring greetings from the families of soldiers in the motherland to their relatives in Korea and thank the Korean people.

    The representatives will represent the Chinese people in expressing their gratitude to their heroic friends and relatives.

Tell our friends and relatives that we thank them, and we will do our best to support them!

    The delegation also brought carefully selected gifts from the Chinese people. Every Korean and Chinese soldier will receive several gifts: a gold pen engraved with "Long Live Sino-Korean Friendship" or "Victory Commemoration of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea," an enamel mug printed with a Tiananmen pattern, a souvenir booklet with a relief of Chairman Mao on the cover, a commemorative badge engraved with the words "Long Live Peace," and colored postcards and ink.

Above the map are embroidered the trust and hope of the people of the motherland for their heroic children: "Defend our beautiful rivers and mountains and build a great industrialized motherland." After the map was embroidered, more than sixty design and embroidery personnel took photos around it, and they sent this photo to the Volunteers as well.

    In addition, the Chinese people specially selected a large number of gifts to give to the heroic Korean people. Among them is a colored portrait of Marshal Kim Il-sung, carefully embroidered with satin by Changsha workers, and a painting embroidered with Picasso's dove of peace flying with outstretched wings. The latter painting also has the four red characters "Long Live Peace" embroidered on it, expressing the Chinese people's determination to defend peace alongside the Korean people. All the Hui people in Chengde City, Rehe Province, selected two kang tables engraved with the ten famous scenic spots of Chengde City to give to the Korean people. The middle of these two kang tables is inlaid with Chengde's special product, elm burl. This is made by picking out the elm tree roots to manufacture.

    In order to express heartfelt respect to the heroes who have made outstanding contributions in the struggle to defend peace, the people of the motherland selected the most meaningful gifts to present to them. He Junxiu of the Technology Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company gave the ancestral sable fur coat to Li Yunfeng, the squad leader of the rocket launcher squad of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers and a first-class meritorious individual, who used his body to lie on the sharp barbed wire to allow the troops to pass over him; the steel casting group of the department also made a silk banner to give to the heroes who victoriously captured and defended "Old Bald Mountain."

    The gifts also include gifts specially dedicated to Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai.

    The gifts also include nearly one million letters of sympathy, more than eight hundred silk banners, and various pictures of the construction of the new China.

    Now, the delegation is traveling in the heroic country, bringing the heart of the Chinese people, and will bring back the heroic deeds created by the heroic friends and relatives in the struggle to defend peace, and their determination to continue the struggle to defend peace.
