Telegram of Greetings to the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea

To the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea:

    On the occasion of the third anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers going abroad to fight, we extend our highest respect and heartfelt gratitude to the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the heroic Korean people, the Korean People's Army, and Marshal Kim Il-sung, the wise leader of the Korean people. The victories achieved by the Chinese People's Volunteers in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea over the past three years are the result of fighting side-by-side and closely coordinating with the heroic Korean People's Army, the result of the fraternal and cordial support of the heroic Korean people, and the result of the great care and assistance given to us by Marshal Kim Il-sung, the Korean government, and the Korean Workers' Party. Victory and glory should belong to the heroic Korean people, the Korean People's Army, and Marshal Kim Il-sung, the wise leader of the Korean people.

    Currently, the Korean armistice is still in an unstable state. All commanders and fighters of our army are seriously watching with high vigilance the vicious schemes of the U.S. aggressors and the Syngman Rhee gang to undermine the repatriation agreement, obstruct and sabotage the political conference, and constantly violate the armistice agreement. We will resolutely defend our positions, strengthen our vigilance, prevent any aggression and provocation from the other side, continue to strengthen the fighting friendship cemented with blood between us and the heroic Korean people, strive to help the Korean people in their restoration and reconstruction work, and continue to work hand in hand to ensure the accurate implementation of the armistice agreement, to strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world to the end!

    All Commanders and Fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers
    October 25

    给朝鲜最高人民会议的致敬电朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议：
    在纪念中国人民志愿军出国作战三周年的时候，谨向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府、英雄的朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民英明的领袖金日成元帅致崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢。中国人民志愿军出国作战三年来在抗美援朝斗争中所取得的胜利，是与英雄的朝鲜人民军并肩作战密切协同的结果，是英雄的朝鲜人民兄弟般亲切支援的结果，是金日成元帅和朝鲜政府、朝鲜劳动党给予我们以莫大的关怀、帮助的结果。胜利与光荣应该属于英雄的朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民的英明领袖金日成元帅。
    目前，朝鲜停战仍然处于不稳定状态，我军全体指挥员、战斗员正在以高度的警惕，严重地注视着美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮破坏遣俘协议，阻挠和破坏政治会议的召开，并不断破坏停战协定的恶毒阴谋。我们将坚决严守阵地，加强戒备，阻止来自对方的任何侵袭和挑衅行动，继续加强我们和英雄的朝鲜人民之间以鲜血凝结起来的战斗友谊，努力帮助朝鲜人民的恢复与重建工作，继续并肩携手地为保障停战协定的确切实施，为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，为保卫远东与世界和平而奋斗到底！
    中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员    十月二十五日
