Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 12th: Commanders and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are preparing to welcome the arrival of the Third Group of People's Comfort Mission to Korea from the motherland with great joy and excitement.

The newspapers of all units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have prominently published the news that the people of the motherland have formed the Third Group of People's Comfort Mission to Korea and that the mission has departed from Beijing for Korea. This good news has spread throughout the Korean front.

Commanders and soldiers are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Third Group of People's Comfort Mission to Korea from the motherland. They say: We will sit on warm kang (heated brick bed) with our relatives from the motherland, talk about the construction of the motherland, Chairman Mao's health, and the hopes of the people of the motherland for us. After hearing the good news that the People's Comfort Mission from the motherland was about to arrive in Korea, the soldiers of a certain unit immediately posted large red slogans on the wall newspaper: "How will you welcome the relatives from the motherland?" The commanders and soldiers of the company where Special-Class Hero Huang Jiguang and First-Class Hero Qiu Shaoyun were before their deaths proposed to welcome the Comfort Mission with the practical actions of each person saving one or two liang (approx. 50-100 grams) of rice every day and cherishing every gun, every bullet, every needle, and every thread sent by the people of the motherland. They said: We must try to reduce the country's expenses as much as possible so that the motherland can concentrate more resources on economic construction. The soldiers guarding the east coast also proposed to welcome the People's Comfort Mission from the motherland with practical actions. Tang Fengxi, the deputy platoon leader who has gloriously earned two First-Class Merits, said: "Since entering Korea, the people of the motherland have cared for us meticulously, but my contribution to the motherland is too little. I must heighten my vigilance, strictly guard the position, guard against sudden enemy incursions, and fight to the end to defend the construction of the motherland and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue!"

Most of the preparations of various units to welcome the People's Comfort Mission from the motherland have been completed. A certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the western front has prepared a large exhibition hall. Various charts, models, and exhibits in the exhibition hall illustrate the combat achievements and work achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army units in the western front, as well as the support of the Chinese and Korean people for the Volunteer Army; the exhibition hall also has many trophies and weapons used by combat heroes. The units have prepared houses and vegetables to entertain the People's Comfort Mission from the motherland. When building the houses for the People's Comfort Mission from the motherland, the commanders and soldiers of the Eighth Company of a certain unit specially and carefully whitewashed the walls and hung colorful pictures in the room. The "Cui Jianguo Platoon's" barracks are on a hillside, and they were afraid that it would be inconvenient for the relatives to walk after the snow, so they added a road more than one meter wide. The soldiers of a certain unit are busy picking firewood in the mountains and forests. They said: The weather is cold, so we must chop more firewood so that our relatives can warm themselves when they come and tell us the news of the motherland's construction. While repairing the road, the soldiers of a certain unit happily sang a 快板 (clapper talk): "Hands blistered, back aches, not afraid of fatigue, not afraid of difficulties, smash the big stones and pave the road flat, flat, clean and beautiful, comrades want to ask why? It's to welcome the relatives from our motherland." Some soldiers are also preparing to give gifts of commemorative significance to the People's Comfort Mission from the motherland. Many company clubs are also actively preparing song and dance programs to perform when welcoming relatives.

    志愿军各部热烈准备欢迎第三届赴朝慰问团
    【新华社平壤十二日电】中国人民志愿军各部指挥员、战斗员正以欢欣鼓舞的心情，准备迎接祖国人民第三届赴朝慰问团的来临。
    中国人民志愿军各部队的报纸，都以显著地位刊登了祖国人民组成第三届赴朝慰问团和慰问团已自北京出发赴朝的消息。这些好消息已传遍朝鲜前线。
    指挥员、战斗员们都兴奋地等待祖国人民第三届赴朝慰问团的到达。他们说：我们将和祖国的亲人们一起坐在热炕上，谈谈祖国的建设，毛主席的健康状况和祖国人民对我们的希望。某部的战士们听到祖国人民慰问团就要来到朝鲜的喜讯后，立即在墙报上贴出大红标语：“你怎样来迎接祖国的亲人？”特级英雄黄继光和一级英雄邱少云生前所在连队的指挥员、战斗员提出要用每人每天节约一两米和爱护祖国人民送来的一枪一弹、一针一线的实际行动来迎接慰问团。他们说：我们要尽量减轻国家的开支，使祖国集中更多的力量从事经济建设。守卫在东海岸上的战士们也提出要以实际行动来迎接祖国人民慰问团。曾经光荣地立了两次一等功的副排长唐凤喜说：“入朝以来，祖国人民无微不至地关怀着我们，但是我对祖国的贡献太少了。我一定要提高警惕，严守阵地，防备敌人的突然进犯，为保卫祖国建设，争取和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗到底！”
    各部队欢迎祖国人民慰问团的准备工作大多数已经完成。西线中国人民志愿军某部准备了一座大展览馆。展览馆里的各种图表、模型、实物说明在西线的中国人民志愿军部队作战成绩和工作成绩，以及中朝人民对志愿军的支援；展览馆里还有许多战利品和战斗英雄用过的武器。各部队已准备好招待祖国人民慰问团住的房子和吃的菜蔬。某部第八连的指挥员、战斗员们在修建招待祖国人民慰问团住的房子时，特地细致地用白粉刷了墙壁，还在屋里挂了彩色图画。“崔建国排”的营房在半山坡上，他们怕下雪后亲人走路不方便，又加修了一公尺多宽的路。某部的战士们忙着到山林中去拣柴。他们说：天气冷了，要多打些柴，叫亲人来了烤得暖和和的，好给我们报告祖国的建设消息。某部战士们在修路时愉快地唱着快板：“手打泡、腰发酸，不怕疲劳不怕难，砸烂大石铺平路，平坦清洁又美观，同志们要问为了啥？是为了迎接咱们祖国的亲人。”有的战士还准备把富有纪念意义的礼物送给祖国人民慰问团。许多连队俱乐部也在积极准备歌舞节目，好在欢迎亲人时演出。
