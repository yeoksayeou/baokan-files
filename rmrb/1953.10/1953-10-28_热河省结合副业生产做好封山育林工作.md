Rehe Province has achieved preliminary success in strengthening afforestation by combining it with sideline production.

In the past, Rehe Province's afforestation work did not adequately consider the needs of the masses for firewood and grazing. Too much land was sealed off too rigidly, causing great dissatisfaction among the people. Since this spring, the province has strengthened afforestation in conjunction with sideline production in mountainous areas, partially resolving the past contradictions between afforestation and firewood gathering, grazing, and green manure production. The disputes caused by afforestation have also been resolved. For example, the three neighboring villages of Manniugou, Wohugou, and Erzhangzi in Kalaqin Left Banner have a total of more than 1,000 sheep. Only Erzhangzi Village has some firewood and grass on its mountain, but Erzhangzi Village planted trees along the roadside and around the springs where livestock are driven, making it impossible for livestock to pass or drink water. As a result, the masses of the three villages had been in dispute for several years. This spring, the three villages jointly came up with a solution. They established a joint village forest protection committee to uniformly plan and manage afforestation, appropriately demarcating areas for firewood gathering and grazing during afforestation. In this way, the contradiction between afforestation and firewood gathering and grazing was resolved. The long-standing dispute between the three villages was also resolved. Another example is the 12th District of Pingquan County, which has a total of 18 administrative villages. After afforestation, eight villages, including Xiaosigou, which are far from the mountains, had no place to cut green stalks for green manure. District cadres convened a joint meeting of village cadres. Each village delineated its boundaries, allowing the masses to cut green stalks for green manure, provided it did not damage soil and water conservation. After that, in half a month, each laborer cut an average of four to five thousand catties of green stalks, increasing the amount of agricultural fertilizer considerably.

Because the interests of the masses were taken into account in afforestation, the broad masses of people have increased their enthusiasm for protecting forests. As a result, the province afforested 38,500 hectares in the first half of this year, and the number of mountain fires and losses have also decreased compared to last year.

    热河省结合副业生产做好封山育林工作
    热河省结合副业生产加强封山育林工作已获得初步成绩。
    热河省的封山育林工作，过去由于没有适当地照顾群众打柴、放牧的需要，封得过多、过死，引起群众很大不满。该省从今春起，便结合山区副业生产加强封山育林工作，部分地解决了过去封山和打柴、放牧、压绿肥的矛盾，因封山而引起的纠纷也得到解决。如喀喇沁左旗牤牛沟、卧虎沟、二杖子等三个邻村，共有一千多只羊，只二杖子村的山上有些柴草，但是，二杖子村在赶牲口的道旁和水泉周围栽上了树，致使牲口不能通过，也不能喝水。因此，三个村的群众闹了几年纠纷。今年春天，这三个村共同想出了解决的办法。成立了联村护林委员会，统一计划、管理封山，封山时适当地划出了打柴和放牧的地区。这样，封山育林和打柴、放牧的矛盾得到解决。三个村多年的纠纷也解决了。又如平泉县十二区共十八个行政村，封山以后，小寺沟等八个离山较远的村子没处割青稞子压绿肥。区干部召集村干部开了联席会议。各村都划定了界限，允许群众在不破坏水土保持的条件下可以割青稞子压绿肥。此后，在半个月时间内，每个劳动力平均割了四、五千斤青稞子，增加了大量的农业肥料。
    由于在封山育林中照顾了群众利益，广大群众提高了爱护山林的积极性。因此，今年上半年该省封山育林三万八千五百公顷，发生山火次数和损失也比去年减少。
