    (Adopted at the 180th Session of the Government Administration Council on May 29, 1953)
    (Promulgated on October 6, 1953)
    In order to closely link higher education with practice, and to cultivate various types of advanced construction talents in a planned way, so as to meet the needs of the country's large-scale economic construction, the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government must closely cooperate with the relevant business departments of the Central People's Government, and implement unified and centralized leadership over higher education institutions across the country in a step-by-step manner. Therefore, the "Decision on the Leadership Relationship of Institutions of Higher Education" promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on August 2, 1950, is revised, and the following decision is made on the leadership relationship of institutions of higher education:
    1. The Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government shall implement unified leadership over all institutions of higher education in the country (excluding military schools, the same below) in accordance with the national education policy and system, and in compliance with the various decisions and instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on national higher education.
    All construction plans (including the establishment or closure of institutions of higher education, the establishment of departments and majors, enrollment tasks, basic construction tasks), financial plans, financial systems (including budget and final account systems, funding expenditure standards, teacher and student benefits, etc.), personnel systems (including personnel appointment and removal, teacher allocation, etc.), teaching plans, teaching syllabuses, production internship regulations, and other important laws, instructions or orders promulgated by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government concerning national higher education shall be implemented by all institutions of higher education in the country. If it is necessary to handle them flexibly, it shall be approved by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government or by the Government Administration Council upon the report of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government.
    2. In order to facilitate the development, construction, and close integration of teaching with practice in institutions of higher education, the direct management of various institutions of higher education shall be divided between the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government and the relevant business departments of the Central Government in accordance with the following principles:
    (1) Comprehensive universities shall be directly managed by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government.
    (2) Multi-disciplinary higher industrial schools related to several business departments shall be directly managed by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government. However, if the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government deems it necessary, it may consult with a relevant business department of the Central Government and entrust it with management.
    (3) Single-discipline institutions of higher education that cultivate cadres for a certain business department or mainly for a certain business department may be entrusted to the relevant business department of the Central Government for management. However, if the relevant business department cannot accept the entrustment due to practical difficulties, it shall be managed by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government.
    (4) For certain institutions of higher education, if the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government and the relevant business departments of the Central Government believe that direct management is temporarily difficult, they may entrust the administrative committee of the greater administrative area, the provincial or municipal people's government, or the people's government of the ethnic autonomous region where the school is located to be responsible for management.
    3. The central business departments and local governments that manage institutions of higher education shall manage the various tasks of the institutions of higher education under their jurisdiction in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Government Administration Council and the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government, and shall submit suggestions and reports to the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government. The specific responsibilities shall be negotiated and determined by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government and the relevant business departments of the Central Government in accordance with the spirit of this decision. If the central business departments and local governments encounter matters not covered by the regulations in managing institutions of higher education, they shall consult with the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government for handling.
    4. The central business departments that manage institutions of higher education shall establish specialized management agencies, maintain close contact with the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government on a regular basis, and, under its guidance, earnestly and responsibly implement the work of managing institutions of higher education. The heads of the central business departments and local governments that manage institutions of higher education shall regularly care about and inspect the progress of this management work.
    5. The Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government shall consult with the relevant central and local business departments on matters related to professional course textbooks, equipment, production internships, scientific research, and other cooperation with production enterprises and organs. The relevant business departments shall actively assist.
    6. All institutions of higher education shall maintain close contact with the administrative committee of the greater administrative area and the provincial and municipal people's governments where they are located, and obtain their guidance and assistance. The administrative committees of the greater administrative areas and the provincial and municipal people's governments have the responsibility of guiding and supervising the local institutions of higher education, and shall provide active assistance and guidance, especially for the school's political leadership, cadre learning, basic construction, general personnel, and security work; however, without the approval of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government, they shall not arbitrarily order the school to suspend classes, take holidays, or change the school's teaching plan.
    7. The "Decision on the Leadership Relationship of Institutions of Higher Education" promulgated on August 2, 1950, shall be repealed from the date of promulgation and implementation of this decision.

    为使高等教育密切联系实际，有计划地培养各类高级建设人才，以适应国家大规模经济建设的需要，中央人民政府高等教育部必须与中央人民政府各有关业务部门密切配合，有步骤地对全国高等学校实行统一与集中的领导。因此，特修改一九五零年八月二日中央人民政府政务院公布的“关于高等学校领导关系的决定”，对高等学校的领导关系作如下的决定：
    一、中央高等教育部根据国家的教育方针、政策与学制，遵照中央人民政府政务院关于全国高等教育的各项决定与指示，对全国高等学校（军事学校除外，以下同）实施统一的领导。
    凡中央高等教育部所颁布的有关全国高等教育的建设计划（包括高等学校的设立或停办、院系及专业设置、招生任务、基本建设任务）、财务计划、财务制度（包括预决算制度、经费开支标准、教师学生待遇等）、人事制度（包括人员任免、师资调配等）、教学计划、教学大纲、生产实习规程，以及其他重要法规、指示或命令，全国高等学校均应执行。其有必要变通办理时，须经中央高等教育部或由中央高等教育部报请政务院批准。
    二、为利于高等学校的发展、建设及教学密切结合实际，关于各高等学校的直接管理工作，得按下列原则由中央高等教育部与中央有关业务部门分工负责：
    （一）综合性大学由中央高等教育部直接管理。
    （二）与几个业务部门有关的多科性高等工业学校由中央高等教育部直接管理。但如中央高等教育部认为必要，得与某一中央有关业务部门协商，委托其管理。
    （三）为某一业务部门或主要为某一业务部门培养干部的单科性高等学校，可以委托中央有关业务部门负责管理。但如有关业务部门因实际困难不能接受委托时，应由中央高等教育部管理。
    （四）对某些高等学校，中央高等教育部及中央有关业务部门认为直接管理暂时有困难时，得委托学校所在地的大区行政委员会或省、市人民政府或民族自治区人民政府负责管理。
    三、管理高等学校的中央各业务部门和地方政府，应按照政务院及中央高等教育部有关高等教育的各项规定，管理所属高等学校的各项工作并向中央高等教育部提出建议和报告。其具体职责由中央高等教育部与中央有关业务部门根据本决定的精神商订之。中央各业务部门和地方政府管理高等学校，如遇有规定未尽事宜应与中央高等教育部协商处理。四、管理高等学校的中央各业务部门应设专管机构，与中央高等教育部经常密切联系，并在其指导下，切实负责执行管理高等学校的工作。管理高等学校的中央各业务部门和地方政府的首长应经常关心和定期检查此项管理工作之进行。
    五、关于高等学校的专业课教材、设备、生产实习、科学研究及其他有关与生产企业机关合作事项，中央高等教育部应与中央及地方各有关业务部门协商处理。各有关业务部门应积极予以协助。
    六、各高等学校应与所在地大区行政委员会及省、市人民政府密切联系，取得其指导与帮助。各大区行政委员会和省、市人民政府对当地高等学校负有指导、监督的责任，对学校的政治领导、干部学习、基本建设、一般人事及警卫等工作尤应予以积极的帮助和指导；但非经中央高等教育部批准，不得擅令学校停课、放假或改变学校的教学计划。
    七、一九五零年八月二日颁布之“关于高等学校领导关系的决定”自本决定公布施行之日起废除。
