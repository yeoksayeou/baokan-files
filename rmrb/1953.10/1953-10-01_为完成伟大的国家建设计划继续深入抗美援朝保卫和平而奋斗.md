    We celebrate the National Day of 1953 with infinite joy! We congratulate the People's Republic of China for the unprecedented great and glorious victories and achievements it has obtained internationally and domestically in just four short years.

    For the past four years, our People's Republic of China, together with fraternal countries within the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, has made great contributions to the movement to stop new wars and safeguard world peace. The Chinese and Korean people fought side by side for three years, repelled the invading forces of the US imperialist bloc, and finally forced them to sign the Korean Military Armistice Agreement. This is not only a great victory for our socialist peace and democracy camp's policy of insisting on a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but also a great victory for the world's people's demand for "resolving international disputes through consultation." This is a major event that we should warmly celebrate this National Day.

    Over the past four years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of China have carried out the movements of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, ideological remolding, and various social reform movements, and have achieved great achievements in economic recovery and development. Based on these victories, and with the great and selfless assistance of our great ally the Soviet Union, we began our first five-year construction plan this year. We will, over a considerable period of time, gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization, gradually realize the country's socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, and steadily transition to a socialist society. The ideal that the Chinese people have pursued for more than a century to build China into an independent, prosperous, and glorious industrial country, after a tortuous road, will steadily reach its destination under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. This is another major event that we should warmly celebrate this National Day.

    While celebrating the National Day with joy and excitement, the people of our country must not relax their high vigilance against imperialist aggressors, nor can they relax their utmost efforts to contribute to the great construction work during the country's transition period!

    The US imperialist aggression group, after being forced to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement, is not reconciled to the failure it encountered, and is still continuing its aggressive "Cold War" provocative policy, obstructing world peace, and opposing the peaceful consultation method for resolving all international disputes and developing friendly cooperation and economic and cultural relations between the peoples of all countries. To this end, we must continue to be vigilant and prevent their aggressive conspiracies. We must further strengthen our unity and cooperation with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, vigorously assist the recovery work of the Korean people, continue to adhere to the peaceful policy, and unremittingly struggle with the peace-loving people of the world to strive for the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, strive for the smooth convening and successful outcome of the political conference, strive for further easing of international tensions, and strive for the peaceful resolution of all international disputes!

    In order to achieve the above goals, in addition to strengthening the unity and cooperation of the world's socialist peace and democracy camp, it is more important to strengthen our country's national defense and economic strength. On the one hand, we must continue to deepen the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and on the other hand, we must strive to achieve the basic tasks of the country's first five-year plan; that is, to concentrate the main forces on developing heavy industry and building the foundation for national industrialization and national defense modernization; correspondingly cultivate construction talents, develop transportation, light industry, agriculture, and commerce; systematically promote the cooperation of agriculture and handicrafts, continue to transform private industry and commerce, correctly play the role of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce; ensure that the proportion of socialist components in the national economy steadily increases, and ensure that on the basis of developing production, the people's material and cultural living standards are gradually improved. This is the direction of our current efforts!

    While celebrating our great and glorious victory on this National Day, the people of the whole country must realize that in order to complete the task of building the motherland and defending world peace, our responsibility is great and the future is infinitely bright. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we must follow the general line of gradually realizing national industrialization and socialist transformation, so as to steadily transition to socialism; we must respond to Chairman Mao's call to study the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, learn from the Soviet Union's experience in socialist construction, and learn from the Soviet Union's advanced science and technology to build our country; we should work harder to increase production, increase income, practice strict economy, reduce expenditures, and strive to complete and overfulfill the great national construction plan!

### 为完成伟大的国家建设计划继续深入抗美援朝保卫和平而奋斗

    为完成伟大的国家建设计划继续深入抗美援朝保卫和平而奋斗
    中国民主同盟主席  张澜
    我们以无限欢乐的心情来庆祝一九五三年的国庆节！庆贺在短短的四年中，中华人民共和国在国际国内获得了空前伟大的辉煌的胜利和成就。
    我们中华人民共和国四年来，与以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营内各兄弟国家在一起，在制止新战争维护世界和平的运动中有了伟大的贡献。中国人民和朝鲜人民并肩战斗了三年，击退了美帝国主义集团的侵略军，终于迫使他们签订了朝鲜军事停战协定。这不只是我们和平民主社会主义阵营坚持和平解决朝鲜问题政策的伟大胜利，也是世界各国人民要求“以协商方式解决国际争端”这一主张的伟大胜利。这是今年国庆节我们应当热烈庆贺的一件大事。
    四年以来，全中国人民在中国共产党、毛主席领导下，进行了抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命、“三反”“五反”、思想改造及各项社会改革运动，进行了经济恢复和发展的工作，都得到了极大的成就。在这些胜利的基础上，在伟大的盟邦苏联大公无私的援助下，今年我们开始了第一个五年建设计划。我们将在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步实现国家对农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造，稳步地过渡到社会主义社会。中国人民百余年来所追求的把中国建设成一个独立富强、光辉灿烂的工业国家的理想，经过曲折迂回的道路，在中国共产党、毛主席领导下，将会稳步地走到目的地。这是今年国庆节我们应当热烈庆贺的另一件大事。
    我全国人民在欢欣鼓舞庆祝国庆的同时，绝不可松懈了对帝国主义侵略者的高度警惕，更不可放松了对于国家过渡时期的伟大建设工作所应贡献的最大努力！
    美帝国主义侵略集团在被迫签订了朝鲜停战协定后，不甘心所遭遇的失败，目前仍在继续着侵略的
  “冷战”挑衅政策，阻挠世界和平，反对用和平协商的方式解决一切国际争端和发展各国人民间的友好合作以及经济文化关系。为此我们必须继续提高警惕，防止他们的侵略阴谋。我们要进一步加强和苏联及各人民民主国家的团结合作，大力援助朝鲜人民的恢复工作，继续坚持和平政策，与全世界爱好和平的人民在一起不懈地斗争，以争取朝鲜停战协定的彻底实施，争取政治会议顺利召开并获致成果，争取进一步地缓和国际紧张局势，争取以和平协商方式解决一切国际争端！
    为期达成上述目的，除了加强世界和平民主社会主义阵营的团结合作外，更重要的是加强我国的国防和经济力量。我们一面要继续深入抗美援朝运动，一面要为实现国家第一个五年计划的基本任务而奋斗；这就是集中主要力量发展重工业，建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础；相应地培养建设人材，发展交通运输业、轻工业、农业和商业；有步骤地促进农业、手工业的合作化，继续进行对私营工商业的改造，正确地发挥个体农业、手工业和私营工商业的作用；保证国民经济中社会主义成份的比重稳步增长，保证在发展生产的基础上，逐步提高人民物质生活和文化生活的水平。这是我们当前努力的方向！
    在今年国庆节庆祝我们的伟大辉煌胜利的同时，全国人民一定要认识为了完成建设祖国保卫世界和平的任务，我们的责任是重大的，前途是无限光明的。我们要在中国共产党、毛主席领导下，循着逐步实现国家工业化和社会主义改造这一总路线，以稳步过渡到社会主义；要响应毛主席的号召，学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，学习苏联社会主义建设的经验，学习苏联先进的科学技术以建设我们的国家；应更加努力增加生产，增加收入，厉行节约，紧缩开支，为完成和超额完成伟大的国家建设计划而奋斗！
