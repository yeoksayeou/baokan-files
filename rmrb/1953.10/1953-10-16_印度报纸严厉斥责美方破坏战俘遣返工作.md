Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 15th: Indian newspapers have criticized the US for undermining the explanation work and hindering the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission from carrying out its mission in order to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

The "New Century" newspaper's editorial on the 10th wrote: "The events of the past few days have demonstrated with utmost clarity that the American warmongers and their lackey, Syngman Rhee, are sabotaging the regulations made by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and hindering the work of the commission. Their aim is to prevent the repatriation of prisoners of war." The editorial pointed out: The US General Hamblen even protested, saying that he did not know why a warning should be issued - that if anyone attempts to use coercive means to prevent the repatriation of any other prisoner of war, strict action should be taken. "This once again shows that the American warmongers are against the repatriation of prisoners of war. They are also afraid that if the prisoners of war understand their repatriation rights, they might exercise such rights."

The editorial said: "After the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission began its work, the American warmongers became increasingly rampant. They used their agents among the prisoners of war to intimidate them, attempting to prevent them from listening to the explanations, from hearing representatives of their homelands explain the true situation to them. These warmongers want to prevent the prisoners of war from being free from the control of brutal agents for even a moment."

The editorial criticized Dulles' speech expressing dissatisfaction with the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, pointing out: "These American remarks do not help the work of repatriating prisoners of war at all, and in fact violate the Korean Armistice Agreement." The editorial said: "The Indian people have a responsibility to protest against the conspiracy to undermine the repatriation of prisoners of war, and should demand strict adherence to and implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement."

The "New Century" newspaper's editorial on the 13th further commented on the US conspiracy to undermine the Korean armistice, saying: "The situation in the past few days shows that the danger of war has not yet been eliminated. The warmongers were forced to temporarily retreat in Korea, but today, they are once again endangering world peace. They want to plunge the people of Asia into the flames of war. The Indian people must recognize this danger and must organize a strong movement to oppose the warmongers. The people can defeat the warmongers' conspiracy."

The "Free Press" editorial on the 10th said: The US conspiracy to undermine the Korean armistice can no longer be kept secret. The editorial wrote: "In order to undermine the Korean armistice, the US is openly hindering all work, hindering the arrangement of explanation work, the repatriation of prisoners of war, and the progress of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's work. The five countries of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have all seen this with their own eyes, and the whole world is beginning to understand this."

The editorial exposed the US conspiracy to delay the construction of the explanation sites and oppose the extension of the explanation period, saying: "It is easy to understand that those whose purpose is to illegally detain prisoners of war by means of force and violence are extremely keen to shorten the explanation period as much as possible." The editorial criticized the US for "carrying out the most egregious provocations against the Indian army" and for "dispatching agents to the prisoner of war camps to create brutal acts of indiscipline."

The Hindi daily "Today's Paper" editorial on the 10th said: The revealed conspiracy to create disturbances in the prisoner of war camps shows that South Korea's threat "is part of a well-planned and widespread conspiracy."

    印度报纸严厉斥责美方破坏战俘遣返工作
    【新华社新德里十五日电】印度报纸斥责美方为了强迫扣留朝中战俘，破坏解释工作，并阻挠中立国遣返委员会执行任务。
    “新世纪报”十日的社论写道：“过去几天的事件万分清楚地说明，美国战争贩子及他们的走狗李承晚正在破坏中立国遣返委员会作出的规定，并阻挠委员会的工作。他们的目的要阻止遣返战俘。”社论指出：美方的汉布伦准将还提出抗议，说他不知道为什么要提出警告——如果任何人企图用强制手段阻止任何别的战俘遣返，就要采取严厉的行动。“这再度说明美国战争贩子反对遣返战俘。他们还害怕，如果战俘了解他们的遣返权利，这些战俘可能运用这种权利。”
    社论说：“中立国遣返委员会开始工作后，美国战争贩子愈来愈猖狂了。他们通过他们在战俘中间的特务，对战俘进行恫吓，企图阻止他们去听解释，去听祖国的代表向他们说明真正的情况。这些战争贩子想让战俘一刻也不能免受野蛮特务的控制。”
    社论斥责杜勒斯对中立国遣返委员会的工作表示不满的演说，指出：“美国的这些言论对遣返战俘的工作毫无帮助，并且事实上还违反了朝鲜停战协定”。社论说：“印度人民有责任抗议破坏战俘遣返工作的阴谋，并且应该要求严格遵守和执行朝鲜停战协定。”
    “新世纪报”十三日的社论又评论美国破坏朝鲜停战的阴谋说：“过去几天的局势说明，战争的危险还没有消除。战争贩子被迫在朝鲜暂时退却，但今天，他们又使世界和平陷于危险中。他们想要把亚洲人民投入战争的烈火中。印度人民必须认识这种危险，必须组织强大的运动来反对战争贩子。人民是可以击败战争贩子的阴谋的。”
    “自由报”十日社论说：美国破坏朝鲜停战的阴谋再也不能保守秘密了。社论写道：“为了破坏朝鲜停战，美方公开地阻挠一切工作，阻挠解释工作的安排、战俘的遣返以及中立国遣返委员会工作的进展。中立国遣返委员会的五个国家都亲眼看到这一点，全世界也都开始了解这一点。”
    社论揭露美方拖延解释场所的修建和反对解释期限顺延的阴谋说：“那些人的目的是要用武力和强暴手段非法扣留战俘，他们万分热中于尽量缩短解释期限是很容易理解的。”社论斥责美方“向印度军队进行最丑恶的挑衅”、并“派遣特务到战俘中间制造违反纪律的野蛮的行动”。
    印地文日报“今天报”十日的社论说：已揭露的在战俘营内制造骚乱的阴谋，说明南朝鲜的威胁“是计划周密的广泛阴谋的一部分。”
