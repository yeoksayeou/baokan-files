    Deputy Director of Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau

    This year's National Day makes me especially happy. I am happy that the Chinese and Korean people have shattered the American imperialists'妄想 attempt to forcibly occupy Korea and invade our country. The Korean armistice is a great victory for peace-loving people. I am happy that the motherland has started the first five-year plan for economic construction. Currently, a production increase and conservation campaign is being launched nationwide to strive to overfulfill the plan for the first year of the Five-Year Plan. Thinking of these happy things, I am even more reminded of this year's "May Day" when I saw our great leader Chairman Mao in Beijing. I also remember last year's "May Day" when I saw the great Stalin in Moscow's Red Square. I also remember the great achievements in socialist construction and the happy life of the Soviet people that I witnessed in the Soviet Union. Happy things, one after another, are simply countless, and they encourage me to move forward!

    Before liberation, the state power was in the hands of the reactionaries, and the hydropower company was bureaucratic capital, an enterprise aimed at making money. In the enterprise, workers were slaves, working hard all year round, and sometimes they couldn't even get enough to eat. How much happiness was there! I am an electrical worker who has worked for thirty years. In the old society, although I was surrounded by generators and boilers all day long, I never even thought about how much electricity the plant generated or what role it played. After liberation, the world has truly turned upside down. The old enterprises of bureaucratic capital are in the hands of the people, and the workers have become the masters of the factory. Everything has changed. The old machines in the hydropower plant have all been repaired and put into use, new machines are constantly being added, and new power plants are also being built. The power generation for industrial and mining production has also greatly increased. Costs have been reduced, and accidents have decreased. The workers are particularly concerned about and cherish their factories. For example, whenever there is a major thunderstorm, if there is lightning in the sky, the employees become vigilant, guarding the motors like a mother fearing her child will be frightened. When the workers hear the good news of reduced coal consumption, they always applaud, cheer, jump and dance with joy. These are all vivid manifestations of the workers' sense of ownership.

    In the four years since liberation, our water and electricity departments alone have seen thousands of creations and rationalization proposals from our worker brothers, but how many were there in the old society? Recently, many new lines have been built, and manpower is felt to be insufficient. The employees of the Wuhan work zone automatically proposed the application of a segmented responsibility flow operation method, dividing the transportation of power poles, planting of power poles, installation of transformers, and hanging of wires into sections, thereby increasing work efficiency several times. They realize that finding ways to overcome difficulties and actively support basic construction is their glorious responsibility.

    In the past four years, 196 workers from our Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau have been promoted to be section chiefs, workshop directors, section chiefs, work zone directors, factory directors, and bureau directors, of which exactly 100 were promoted last year and this year. I am also one of them. These cadres, with the support and leadership of the Party, the assistance of technical personnel, and especially the trust and assistance of the workers, have gradually learned to do leadership work. Zhang Rif, a line renovation worker, was promoted to technician last year and is now the engineering section chief of the Wuhan work zone. He leads fifty or sixty workers to renovate new lines and has achieved great results. This time, he was selected as a special-class model for the entire bureau. Du Songlin, an old repair worker who has worked with me for more than 20 years, is now the deputy director of the Sixth Power Plant. Their director is temporarily away from his post to study at the Party School, and he has taken on the responsibility of leading the entire plant's production. Old Du is already 52 years old, but his enthusiasm is getting stronger and stronger. The other day when we met, he excitedly told me about his experience of learning the leadership method of the mass line at the Party School.

    Many old workers have been transferred to planning, design, basic construction and other departments to do work that needs them more. In the operational departments, we have trained a group of young technical cadres. In 1951, we recruited more than 300 young workers, and within three or four months, we trained twenty young turbine drivers and other technical workers. Most of the people on duty in the operational departments are young workers. Now, we are still training young technicians and engineers from among the young workers!

    Old workers will encounter some difficulties when working in leadership positions. At first, I was also afraid that I wouldn't be able to do it because of my low education level. But with the Party's support, cultivation and education, and the masses' support and help, this greatly encouraged my confidence. When I was transferred to work, the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee personally talked to me and gave me many instructions. He also said that the Party would help me with any difficulties I encounter in the future. The worker comrades also said to me: "Old Peng: We will carry 100 catties of burden together. You carry 20 catties, and we will carry 80 catties." In this way, from October 1950, I took on the role of director of the water plant, and later director of the power plant, and this year I was transferred to the bureau. I firmly held in my heart a principle: relying on the Party, relying on the masses, learning humbly and persistently, there will be a way. Doing so, I became much bolder in my work.

    Safe power supply is the key issue in our production. At first, some comrades were unclear about the quality of electricity and said that electricity is a special product and it is difficult to determine its quality. Later, everyone also clarified: for example, if it should generate 6,600 volts of power, then maintaining the standard voltage and ensuring safe power supply is good quality of electricity. We also often use the method of mobilizing everyone to do detailed calculations to calculate the loss to the people and the country from an accident, as well as the impact on the country's economic construction. In this way, everyone's understanding of safe power supply has been improved. In order to ensure the safety of power supply and save electricity, we have invited worker comrades from the electricity consumption departments and power supply departments to hold seminars. The comrades put forward many valuable opinions and methods, which greatly improved our work. This also shows that everyone cherishes the people's electricity industry.

    This year I was transferred to the bureau to assist the director in overall work. I have encountered many new difficulties in my work. The work is progressing so fast, and there are many things that I don't understand. What should I do? The Party constantly teaches and urges us to study hard and catch up with the needs of work progress. Even though I am 51 years old, I still have the confidence and determination to study hard and strive to complete my work tasks.

    Among the 141 large-scale projects that the Soviet government is helping our country build are huge projects to establish new-type power stations. The establishment of these power stations will inevitably greatly advance our country's electrical industry, and will also greatly advance our country's industrial construction and national defense construction. We must thank the Soviet big brother for their help by rapidly launching and deepening the production increase and conservation campaign and ensuring the overfulfillment of this year's national plan, and use this to celebrate our country's fourth National Day.

    庆祝中华人民共和国成立四周年
    武汉市特等劳动模范
    武汉冶电业局副局长
    彭仰钦
    今年的国庆节使我特别高兴。高兴的是中朝人民粉碎了美帝国主义武力侵占朝鲜和侵略我国的妄想，朝鲜停战了，爱好和平的人民得到了伟大胜利。高兴祖国已经开始了第一个五年计划的经济建设，目前全国都展开了增产节约竞赛，要争取超额完成五年计划头一年的计划。想起这些高兴的事，我更想起了今年“五一”节，我在北京看到了我们伟大的领袖毛主席。想起去年“五一”节，我在莫斯科红场看见了伟大的斯大林。还想起我在苏联亲眼看到的社会主义建设中的伟大成就和苏联人民的幸福生活。高兴的事儿，一串连一串，简直数也数不尽，它鼓舞着我努力前进！
    解放以前，国家政权在反动派手里，水电公司是官僚资本，是以发财为目的的企业。在企业中，工人是奴隶，终年辛苦，有时候连饭都吃不饱，那里还有多少高兴的事！我是个做了三十年工的电业工人，在旧社会里，虽然整天围着发电机和锅炉转，但厂里究竟发了多少电，起了什么作用，我连想都不去想它。解放以后，真是天翻地复，官僚资本的旧企业，掌握在人民手里了，工人成了工厂的主人，什么事都变样了；水电厂的旧机器全都修好并使用起来了，新机器也在不断增加，新发电厂也在修建，供应工矿生产的动力发电也大大增加了。成本降低，事故减少了。工人们特别关心和爱护自己的工厂，例如每逢大雷雨天，天空若有闪电，职工们就都紧张戒备起来，像母亲怕孩子受惊一样地守护着电机，工人们听到煤耗降低的喜报时，总是高兴得鼓掌、欢呼、又蹦又跳。这都是工人有了主人翁的感觉的生动表现。
    解放后四年来，单是我们水、电部门就出现了千百件工人弟兄们的创造和合理化建议，可是旧社会有过几件呢？最近新修线路多，人手感到不足，武汉工区的职工就自动提出施用分段负责流水作业法，把运送电杆、栽电杆、装变压器、挂线等部分分段进行，这样提高工作效率数倍。他们认识到：想办法克服困难，积极支援基本建设是自己光荣的职责。
    四年来我们武汉冶电业局已经有一百九十六个工人被提拔当了股长、工场长、科长、工区主任、厂长和局长，其中去年和今年就整整提拔了一百名。我自己也是其中的一个。这些干部，得到了党的支持和领导，得到了技术人员的帮助，特别是得到了工人的信任和帮助，他们已经逐渐学会作领导工作了。线路装修工人张日富去年被提升为技术员，今年担任武汉工区工程股长，他带领着五、六十个工人装修新线路，工作很有成绩，这次又被选成全局的特等模范了。和我在一起作了二十几年工的老修理工人杜松林，现在已经担任第六发电厂的副厂长。他们的正厂长暂时离职进党校学习去了，他便挑起了领导全厂生产的担子，老杜已经是五十二岁的人了，干劲却越来越足。前几天见面，他还兴奋地对我讲了些他进党校学习群众路线的领导方法的情形。
    许多老工人被调往计划、设计、基本建设等部门去做更需要他们担任的工作。在运转部门，我们培养了一批青年技术干部，一九五一年招考了三百多个青年工人，三、四个月以内，就培养训练出了二十几个年轻的透平司机和其他技术工人。运转部门担任值长的，大部分都是青年工人。现在还正从青年工人中培养青年技师和工程师呢！
    老工人到领导岗位上工作，是会遇到一些困难的。起先我也怕自己文化程度低干不了。但是有党支持我、培养教育我，群众支持帮助我，这就大大鼓舞了我的信心。调动工作时，市委书记亲自找我谈话，给了我许多指示，他还说以后遇到什么困难，党会帮助我。工人同志们也对我说：“老彭：一百斤的担子我们大伙挑，你挑二十斤，我们挑八十斤”。这样从一九五○年十月起，我就担任起水厂厂长、后来是电厂厂长，今年又调到局里来了。我心里牢牢抱定了一条主意：依靠党、依靠群众，虚心、顽强地学习就有办法。这样作，工作起来就大胆多了。
    安全供电是我们生产中的关键问题。最初有些同志对电的质量问题弄不清，说电是个特别产品，很难定质量。后来大家也明确了：譬如应该发六千六电压的动力电，那么，始终保持标准电压，安全供电，这就是电的质量好。我们更常常用发动大家算细账的办法，计算发生一次事故对人民和国家的损失，以及对国家经济建设的影响。这样，大家便提高了对安全供电的认识。为了保证供电安全和节约用电，我们曾邀请用电部门和供电部门的工人同志们来开座谈会，同志们提出了很多宝贵的意见和办法，大大的改进了工作。这也说明了大家都很爱护人民的电业。
    今年我被调到局里来协助局长搞全面工作，在工作中遇到了很多新的困难，工作进展这么快，很多事情我不懂得，这又怎么办呢？党经常教导和督促我们，要我们努力学习，赶上工作进展的需要。别看我是五十一岁的人了，我还有刻苦学习、努力完成工作任务的信心和决心。
    苏联政府帮助我国建设的一百四十一项规模巨大的工程当中，包括建立新型电力站的巨大工程。这些电力站的建立，必然会使我国的电气事业大大前进一步，也必然会使我国的工业建设和国防建设大大前进一步。我们一定要以迅速开展和深入增产节约竞赛、保证超额完成今年的国家计划的行动，来感谢苏联老大哥的帮助，并以此来庆祝我国第四届国庆节。
