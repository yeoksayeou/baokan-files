(Xinhua News Agency, October 9th) Premier Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government Administration Council received Professor Ikuo Oyama, Chairman of the Japanese Peace Supporters' Committee, on September 28, 1953. The conversation went as follows:

    Professor Oyama: In the past, Japanese militarists carried out a long-term invasion of China, and the Japanese people failed to stop it in time, causing huge losses to the Chinese people. I represent the Japanese people in expressing my apologies to the Chinese people. The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people have consistently adopted a friendly attitude towards the Japanese people. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the Japanese people.

    Premier Zhou: The aggressive crimes of the Japanese militarists against foreign countries not only caused huge losses to the Chinese people and the people of various countries in the Far East, but also brought unprecedented disasters to the Japanese people themselves. I believe that the peace-loving people of Japan will remember this historical lesson and will not allow Japan to be remilitarized and to carry out foreign aggression again, so as to avoid Japan suffering even deeper disasters than in the past and present. Today, the Japanese people are waging a heroic struggle to win national independence and oppose remilitarization, and the Chinese people express their respect for this.

    Professor Oyama: Eastern countries, especially China and Japan, should have close relations due to historical and geographical reasons.

    Premier Zhou: We advocate restoring normal relations with all countries in the world, especially with Japan. However, if the Japanese government continues to act as a tool for the United States to invade China and other Eastern countries, continues to implement a policy of hostility towards The People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, and continues to maintain so-called diplomatic relations with the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang, then Japan will increasingly become an unstable factor in the Pacific, thereby hindering the possibility of Japan concluding a peace treaty with the New China and establishing normal diplomatic relations.

    Professor Oyama: I believe that before the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, it does not hinder cultural and economic exchanges between the people of the two countries.

    Premier Zhou: Yes. We welcome Japanese people's delegations to visit our country, and our people are also willing to send delegations to visit Japan. However, today, American imperialism and Japanese reactionaries are hindering the development of friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people. The current Japanese government openly implements the so-called embargo of the U.S. government and tries its best to hinder the development of Sino-Japanese trade and cultural exchanges. Therefore, breaking this obstacle first requires the joint efforts of the people of both countries.

    The trade relationship between China and Japan must be based on equality and mutual benefit. Some Japanese people believe: "Once China is industrialized, there will be no future for Sino-Japanese trade." It must be pointed out that this is completely wrong. Only when China is industrialized can it fundamentally change the imperialist and semi-colonial economic relationship of so-called "industrial Japan, raw material China" in the past, and establish a truly equal and mutually beneficial trade relationship of exchanging what each has. As China gradually realizes industrialization, the production and needs of the Chinese state and people will become increasingly expanded, and it will increasingly need to develop international trade relations. And Japan is China's neighbor, and on the basis of peaceful coexistence, the development of Sino-Japanese trade and economic exchanges has a broad future.

    Professor Oyama: The resolution on the Japan issue adopted at the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing, China, in October 1952 has been increasingly understood and supported by the Japanese people.

    Premier Zhou: The spirit of this resolution lies in: in order to safeguard the peace and security of the Pacific, it is necessary to prevent the new danger of war deepened by Japan being turned into a U.S. military base and remilitarized.

    We believe that an independent, democratic, peaceful, and free Japan should have its own self-defense armed forces. However, unfortunately, Japan is now occupied by the U.S. military, controlled by the United States, and is carrying out rearmament and reviving Japanese militarism in accordance with the intentions of the U.S. aggressors. This has threatened the peace and security of the Pacific, and we cannot but pay close attention to it. We should say that a strong New China today already has the strength to defend its own country and is increasingly becoming an important pillar in defending peace in the East.

    Today, two different futures are placed before the Japanese people: one is a militarist Japan in the position of a U.S. vassal state, which is what the Japanese reactionary forces demand; the other is an independent, peaceful, democratic, and free Japan, which is the goal of the Japanese people's struggle. The current situation is favorable to the Japanese people. The two futures must go through a long-term struggle, and we believe that the Japanese people will surely win the final victory.

    The Chinese people deeply understand the suffering of the Japanese people who are in dire straits due to being occupied by foreign troops, a suffering that Japan has never experienced in its history. The Chinese people hope that the Japanese people can obtain the rebirth and independence of their motherland, and hope that China and Japan can truly coexist and prosper together on the basis of peaceful coexistence.

    Professor Oyama: Thank you and the Chinese people for your care and friendship for the Japanese people.

The conversation ended in a friendly and amiable atmosphere. Premier Zhou also took a photo with Professor Oyama as a souvenir. (Attached picture)

    周总理接见大山郁夫
    并就中日关系发表谈话
   【新华社九日讯】中央人民政府政务院周恩来总理于一九五三年九月二十八日接见了日本拥护和平委员会主席大山郁夫教授。谈话经过如下：
    大山教授：过去日本军国主义分子长期侵略中国，日本人民未能及时加以制止，使中国人民蒙受巨大损失，我代表日本人民向中国人民表示歉意。中华人民共和国政府和中国人民对于日本人民一贯采取友好态度，我代表日本人民谨致感谢。
    周总理：日本军国主义分子的对外侵略罪行，不仅使中国人民和远东各国人民遭受了巨大损失，同时更使日本人民蒙受了空前未有的灾难。我相信，日本爱好和平的人民将会记取这一历史教训，不再让日本重新军国主义化和重新对外侵略，以免日本重新蒙受比过去和现在更加深重的灾难。今天日本人民正在为争取民族独立、反对重新军国主义化而进行着英勇的斗争，中国人民对此表示敬意。
    大山教授：东方各国，尤其是中国和日本，由于历史和地理的原因，关系应该密切。
    周总理：我们是主张恢复与世界各国的正常关系，特别是与日本的正常关系的。但是，如果日本政府仍然继续做美国侵略中国和东方各国的工具，仍然继续执行敌视中华人民共和国和中国人民的政策，并仍然继续保持与蒋介石残余匪帮的所谓外交关系，那么，日本就将日益成为太平洋上不安的因素，从而阻碍着日本与新中国缔结和约和建立正常外交关系的可能。
    大山教授：我以为，中日两国外交关系未建立之前，并不妨碍两国人民之间进行文化交流和经济交流。
    周总理：是的。我们欢迎日本人民代表团前来我国访问，同时我国人民也愿意派代表团前往日本访问。但是今天美帝国主义和日本反动派阻碍着中日两国人民友好关系的发展。日本现政府公然执行着美国政府的所谓禁运，竭力阻碍中日贸易的发展和文化的交流。因此，首先打破这个阻碍，需要两国人民的共同奋斗。
    中日两国之间的贸易关系，必须建立在平等互利的基础之上。有些日本人认为：“中国工业化了，中日贸易就没有前途。”必须指出，这是完全不对的。只有中国工业化，才能彻底改变过去那种所谓“工业日本、原料中国”的帝国主义和半殖民地的经济关系，而建立起真正平等互利、有无相通的贸易关系。中国逐步实现工业化，中国国家和人民的生产和需要就会愈加扩大，它就愈加需要发展国际间的贸易关系。而日本是中国的近邻，在和平共处的基础上，中日贸易的发展和经济的交流，是完全有它的广阔前途的。
    大山教授：一九五二年十月在中国北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上所通过的关于日本问题的决议，已日益为日本人民所了解和支持。
    周总理：这个决议的精神在于：为了保卫太平洋的和平与安全，必须防止因日本被变为美国军事基地及重新军国主义化而加深的新战争的危险。
    我们认为，一个独立、民主、和平、自由的日本，应该有它的自卫武装的力量。但是，不幸得很，日本现在是被美国军队所占领，受美国控制，并按照美国侵略者的意图，在进行着重整军备，复活日本军国主义。这就使得太平洋的和平与安全受到了威胁，我们不能不予以深切注意。我们应该说，强大的新中国今天已有力量保卫自己的国家，并且日益成为保卫东方和平的重要支柱。
    今天摆在日本人民面前的，是两个不同的前途：一个是处于美国附庸国地位的军国主义的日本，这是日本反动势力所要求的；另一个是独立、和平、民主、自由的日本，这是日本人民的奋斗目标。今天的形势是对日本人民有利的。两个前途必须经过长期斗争，我们相信日本人民一定能够获得最后的胜利。
    中国人民深刻了解因被外国军队占领而陷于水深火热中的日本人民的痛苦，这种痛苦是日本历史上未曾有过的。中国人民希望日本人民能够得到他们祖国的新生和独立，希望中日两国在和平共处的基础上真正能够共存共荣。
    大山教授：感谢您和中国人民对于日本人民的关怀和友谊。
    谈话在友好和蔼空气中结束。周总理并和大山教授拍摄照片，以留纪念。（附图片）
