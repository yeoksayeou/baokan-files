The various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company are continuing to establish and improve the responsibility system in the production increase and economy campaign, further implementing work plans, and striving to overfulfill production increase and economy plans.

Since the launch of the production increase and economy campaign, those factories and mines that have seriously studied past production, grasped key issues, strengthened central work, and fully mobilized the masses have seen relatively rapid and in-depth development of the campaign. However, some factories and mines, although mobilizing the masses, inspecting past work, and grasping key issues, do not know how to strengthen current central work, so the production increase and economy campaign cannot be rapidly deepened. Individual factory and mine leaders are clueless, take a long time to calculate, and have not deeply mobilized the masses, so the production increase and economy campaign is progressing very slowly. For example, after the primary rolling mill carried out a week of major repairs, the leading cadres only then began preparing for the production increase and economy campaign. As of September 19th, only the section cadres had held discussions, and the majority of workers had not yet participated in discussions. When arranging production increase and economy work, the leading cadres did not clearly explain the work methods and steps, making it impossible for the workers to start.

Currently, the following problems are still common in the production increase and economy campaigns of Anshan Iron and Steel Company:

    First, some cadres do not clearly understand the relationship between continuing to implement work plans, establishing and improving the responsibility system, and carrying out the production increase and economy campaign, and treat them as mutually opposed, thus affecting the progress of the work. The chemical plant's campaign was launched relatively quickly, but because it was disconnected from the central work, it still could not achieve greater results.

    Second, some units have not fully mobilized technical personnel and staff to participate in the competition, and have not put forward specific requirements based on their characteristics, so the role of technical personnel and staff has not been well utilized.

    Third, some units are busy carrying out production increase and economy campaigns and have neglected security work, so many accidents have occurred recently. For example, personal accidents have occurred in the scrap iron plant and the concentrating plant during the competition; the mechanical equipment of the iron smelting plant has also frequently experienced accidents recently, which greatly hinders the implementation of work plans and the development of production increase and economy campaigns.

    Fourth, recently some units have only focused on finding waste products and cleaning up warehouses, and have neglected to increase production and save money from major aspects such as increasing production and reducing consumption quotas.

### 鞍钢各厂矿增产节约竞赛正在深入开展  部分单位不注意结合中心工作收效不大

    鞍钢各厂矿增产节约竞赛正在深入开展
    部分单位不注意结合中心工作收效不大
    鞍山钢铁公司各厂矿在增产节约竞赛中，继续进行建立与健全责任制的工作，进一步贯彻作业计划，努力争取超额完成增产节约计划。
    增产节约竞赛展开以来，凡是认真研究了过去的生产情况，抓住关键问题，加强中心工作，充分地发动了群众的厂矿，增产节约竞赛开展得比较迅速、深入。但是，有些厂矿虽然发动了群众，检查了过去的工作，抓住了关键问题，但不知如何加强当前中心工作，因此增产节约竞赛不能迅速地深入下去。个别厂矿领导干部心中无数，算账时间长，没有深入发动群众，增产节约竞赛开展得很迟缓。如初轧厂进行了一个星期的中修工作以后，领导干部才进行增产节约竞赛的准备工作，到九月十九日还只是工段干部进行了讨论，大部分职工尚未进行讨论。领导干部在布置增产节约工作时也没有明确交代工作方法和步骤，使职工没法着手进行。
    目前，鞍钢各厂矿增产节约竞赛还普遍存在下面几个问题：
    一、部分干部对继续贯彻作业计划、建立与健全责任制工作与开展增产节约竞赛的关系认识不清楚，把它们互相对立起来，因而影响了工作的进展。化工总厂竞赛开展得比较迅速，但由于和中心工作脱节，结果还是不能收到更大的效果。
    二、部分单位没有充分发动技术人员和职员参加到竞赛中去，没有针对他们的特点提出具体的要求，因而没有很好地发挥技术人员和职员的作用。
    三、部分单位忙于开展增产节约竞赛，忽视了保安工作，因此最近发生了不少事故。如碎铁厂、选矿厂在竞赛中竟发生了人身事故；炼铁厂的机械设备最近也经常发生事故，这对贯彻作业计划和开展增产节约竞赛有很大的妨碍。
    四、最近部分单位只注意找废品、清理仓库等次要方面，忽视从增产和降低消耗定额等主要方面来增产节约。
