    Visiting Lu Xun's Hometown
    Shaoxing City, Zhejiang Province, is the hometown of Mr. Lu Xun. The city has many buildings and cultural relics closely related to Mr. Lu Xun's early life. After the liberation of Shaoxing City, the People's Government paid special attention to the preservation and repair of these buildings and cultural relics to commemorate this great standard-bearer of China's new culture.
    Mr. Lu Xun's early residence was in Dongchangfang, Shaoxing City. Dongchangfang has now been renamed Lu Xun Road. Mr. Lu Xun's former residence is located in the western part of Zhoujia Xintai Gate at Dongchangfangkou, which is now part of No. 182 Lu Xun Road. It was officially established as the Lu Xun Memorial Hall in January of this year. In addition, the Sanwei Study where Mr. Lu Xun studied in his early years, the Zhoujia Old Tai Gate where his family ancestral home was located, and the studio where he worked when he taught at Shaoxing Middle School (now Zhejiang Shaoxing Middle School) after returning from studying in Japan, have also been preserved by the People's Government.
    The Zhoujia Xintai Gate, where the Lu Xun Memorial Hall is located, is a five-courtyard old-style building. The courtyards inside and outside have been whitewashed and painted, and renovated. Mr. Lu Xun's father, mother, brothers, and others lived in the third and fourth courtyards of the west courtyard. The two rooms downstairs in the third courtyard were where Mr. Lu Xun lived after returning from Japan. The second room from the west to the east in the fourth courtyard is divided into north and south rooms by wooden boards. The north room was the residence of Mr. Lu Xun's mother, and the south room was where the whole family of Mr. Lu Xun ate after he returned from Japan. Now, the Lu Xun Memorial Hall has collected the tables, chairs, and furniture used in these two rooms from Mr. Lu Xun's relatives and friends, and is preparing to arrange them in their original appearance before the anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death this year.
    The third and fourth courtyards of Xintai Gate upstairs have seven cultural relic exhibition rooms. Among the cultural relics on display are the "Jianlüe" that Mr. Lu Xun read in his childhood, and the "Huajing" that he said he first obtained and loved most in the article "A Chang and The Classic of Mountains and Seas", with his annotations on it. There are also dozens of thread-bound textbooks he used when he studied in Nanjing, including "Geometry," "Evolution," and "Eight Line Studies," which were handwritten by him with very neat handwriting. In addition, there is a group photo of him with all the teachers and students when he taught at Shaoxing Middle School, and the "Physiology Lecture Notes" compiled and printed by him when he served as a physiology teacher at Zhejiang Second-Level Normal School (in Hangzhou). In addition, there are two "Complete Works of Lu Xun" and magazines such as "Zhejiang Tide" and "Henan" that published Mr. Lu Xun's early works, as well as various magazines that he later participated in editing.
    Behind the Xintai Gate is the "Hundred Herb Garden" described by Mr. Lu Xun in "Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk". Although this garden has been transformed by later residents and rockeries and pavilions have been built in the garden, its former appearance can still be identified. Climbing the rockery, you can see the Changqing Temple on Dongchangfang Straight Street and the Tuguci facing Changqing Temple across the street, which appeared in Mr. Lu Xun's works.
    The Sanwei Study, where Mr. Lu Xun studied as a child, is near the Xintai Gate. The study still has the desks and chairs used in the old days, and the desk and chair used by Mr. Lu Xun at that time are also placed in their original places. The plaque with the four characters "Sanwei Study" written on it, which Mr. Lu Xun wrote about in his article, and the painting under the plaque depicting "a very fat sika deer lying under an ancient tree" are still hanging in their old places. The furnishings in the corridor outside the study are also the same as they were in the past. The small garden behind the study and the flower beds in the garden still exist.
    Opposite the gate of Sanwei Study is the Zhoujia Old Tai Gate. This is the earliest place where Mr. Lu Xun's ancestors lived after arriving in Shaoxing. When Mr. Lu Xun was a child, he often followed his elders to the Old Tai Gate on sacrificial days or New Years. The Old Tai Gate is still as complete as before, and all the old Zhou family members live in it.
    In 1909, Mr. Lu Xun returned from Japan. In 1910, he served as a teacher and supervisor at the then Shaoxing Middle School. After the liberation of Shaoxing, this school was renamed Zhejiang Shaoxing Middle School. The People's Government turned Mr. Lu Xun's studio and bedroom behind it into a Lu Xun Memorial Room.
    Shortly after the liberation of Shaoxing, Xintai Gate, Old Tai Gate, and Sanwei Study were successively opened as areas commemorating Mr. Lu Xun, and many people from all over the country came to pay their respects. From October 19th to the 6th day in 1951, more than 4,400 people came to visit Mr. Lu Xun's former residence. People passing by Shaoxing from other places often detour to pay their respects. Many international friends also came to visit.
    The 17th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death—October 19th—is approaching, and the people of Shaoxing City have begun grand commemorative preparations. The Zhejiang Provincial People's Government allocated a special fund in early September for the repair of Mr. Lu Xun's former residence, Sanwei Study, and Old Tai Gate. Now the Xintai Gate of the former residence has been completely repaired, and the repair work of Sanwei Study will also be completed before the 19th of this month, and the repair project of Old Tai Gate will also start soon. The Memorial Hall has decided to open daily from October 19th, and Lu Xun's residence and Sanwei Study will also be open for half a month, so that the masses who admire Mr. Lu Xun will have the opportunity to visit.

    访鲁迅故乡
    新华社记者  张济生
    浙江省绍兴市是鲁迅先生的故乡，市内有很多与鲁迅先生早年生活有密切关系的建筑和文物。绍兴市解放后，人民政府对这些建筑和文物特别注意保管和修缮，以纪念这位中国新文化的伟大旗手。
    鲁迅先生早年的故居在绍兴城内东昌坊，东昌坊现在已改名为鲁迅路。鲁迅先生的故居东昌坊口周家新台门西部，即现在鲁迅路一百八十二号的一部分，已在今年一月正式成立了鲁迅纪念馆。另外还有鲁迅先生早年读书的三味书屋，他的家族祖居的周家老台门，和他从日本留学回国后在绍兴中学堂（现浙江省绍兴中学）任教时的工作室，也都已由人民政府加以保管。
    鲁迅纪念馆所在的周家新台门是一座五进的旧式楼房，院落内外都已粉刷油漆，修饰一新。鲁迅先生的父亲母亲和兄弟等人当时就住在西院第三和第四两进房屋里。第三进楼下两间是鲁迅先生从日本回国后居住的地方。第四进从西面往东的第二间，用木板隔成了南北两间，北屋是鲁迅先生母亲的住屋，南屋是鲁迅先生从日本回国后全家吃饭的地方。现在鲁迅纪念馆已经从鲁迅先生的亲友处搜集到当年这两间房里所用的桌椅家具，准备在今年鲁迅先生逝世纪念日前照原来的样子布置。
    新台门第三和第四进的楼上是七间文物陈列室。所陈列的文物中有鲁迅先生儿童时代读过的“鉴略”，鲁迅先生在“阿长与山海经”一文中所说的、他最初得到和最为心爱的“花镜”，上面还有他的批注。他在南京求学时所用的数十本线装课本，其中“几何学”、“开方”、“八线学”等是他手抄的，字迹十分工整。另外还有他在绍兴中学堂任教时和全校师生合摄的照片，他在浙江两级师范学堂（在杭州）担任生理学教员时所编印的“生理学讲义”等。此外，陈列室里还有两部“鲁迅全集”和刊载过鲁迅先生早年作品的“浙江潮”、“河南”等杂志以及他后来参加编辑的杂志多种。
    新台门后面就是鲁迅先生在“朝花夕拾”里描写过的“百草园”。这个园子虽然经后来的住户改造过，并在园里修筑了假山、亭阁，但昔日面貌依然可以辨认。登上假山，可以看见在鲁迅先生作品中出现过的东昌坊直街上的长庆寺和与长庆寺夹街相对的土谷祠。
    鲁迅先生幼时读书的地方——三味书屋就在新台门附近。书房里仍然摆着旧日用过的桌椅，鲁迅先生当时所用的课桌和椅子也摆在原处。鲁迅先生文章里写过的上有“三味书屋”四个字的匾，和匾下那幅画着“一只很肥大的梅花鹿伏在古树下”的画依然悬在旧处。书屋外面走廊上的陈设布置也一如当年。书屋后面的小园和园里的花坛依然存在。
    三味书屋大门的对面是周家老台门。这是鲁迅先生的祖先到绍兴后最早居住的地方。鲁迅先生小时在祭日或新年常常随着长辈到老台门来。老台门现在仍然和从前一样完整，在里面居住的都是周家旧族。
    一九零九年鲁迅先生从日本回国后，一九一○年曾在当时绍兴中学堂担任教员兼监学。绍兴解放后，这所学校改为浙江省绍兴中学，人民政府把当年鲁迅先生在这里的工作室和后面的卧室辟作了鲁迅纪念室。
    绍兴解放后不久，新台门、老台门和三味书屋曾相继作为纪念鲁迅先生的地区而开放，各地前来瞻仰的人很多。一九五一年十月十九日起六天中，便有四千四百多人到鲁迅先生故居来参观，外地路过绍兴的人也常绕道前来瞻仰。还有不少国际友人前来访问。
    鲁迅先生逝世十七周年纪念日——十月十九日就要到了，绍兴市人民又开始了隆重的纪念筹备工作。浙江省人民政府在九月初拨了一笔专款作为修理鲁迅先生故居和三味书屋、老台门之用。现在故居新台门已经完全修好，三味书屋修理工作也将在本月十九日以前结束，老台门的修理工程也快要动工。纪念馆决定从十月十九日起每日开放，鲁迅住屋和三味书屋也将开放半月，以便景仰鲁迅先生的群众有机会来参观。
