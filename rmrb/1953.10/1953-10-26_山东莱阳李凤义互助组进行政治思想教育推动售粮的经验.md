Editor's Note: Yesterday, on the second page of this newspaper, an economic work commentary titled "Two Good Experiences" introduced two experiences in purchasing wheat. The experience of Taigu, Shanxi, was published simultaneously with the economic work commentary. Now, we are publishing the experience of the Li Fengyi Mutual Aid Team in Laiyang, Shandong.

The members of the Li Fengyi Mutual Aid Team in Lijiayao Village, Laiyang County, Shandong Province (a total of ten households), have seen their production increase year by year and their lives gradually improve through several years of mutual aid in labor. The whole team now owns a horse, a donkey, and three cows; and has raised ten fat pigs from spring to now. Except for one household that has some difficulties, the rest of the households are living a middle-peasant life. However, due to insufficient political education, the team members generally have the idea of "only caring about personal production and not caring about national construction." After the wheat harvest this year, every household stored wheat but was unwilling to sell it to the state, hoping to wait for a higher price. When autumn corn needed topdressing, they were unwilling to sell wheat to buy fertilizer, and instead borrowed 300 jin of fertilizer from the state. The situation of the team leader Li Fengyi was similar. He cultivated more than ten mu of land and did not have livestock and wanted to buy a donkey; however, he always thought that the price of wheat would rise in the future, so he kept the wheat and didn't sell it. The situation of other team members was also similar. This hindered the expansion of agricultural production, which was detrimental to the country and not good for the farmers themselves.

Li Fengyi attended the mutual aid representative meeting in the township. After the cadres explained the situation, he understood the reasoning. After returning home, he convened a meeting of all team members to encourage everyone to discuss the issue, combining the reasons he understood with the specific situation of the team to carry out patriotic education, and improve everyone's political awareness in many ways:

(1) From summarizing production and analyzing the sources of production achievements, the relationship between the state and the peasants was explained, and the personal interests and national interests were unified. Team member Ren De said: "My crops have never grown as well as they have this year. In the past, I didn't have livestock or pigs, but now I have a big cow and two fat pigs. In 1951, I harvested eight dou of wheat, in 1952 I harvested one shi, and this year I harvested one shi and five dou, more each year." "In the past, I also put in a lot of effort every year, but I got poorer every year. Since the Communist Party came, I have been getting better step by step. In the past, I had no land, but I got land after the land reform; the shortage of livestock labor was solved by organizing mutual aid teams; the lack of farm tools and seeds was helped by government loans; when there were disasters, the government issued grain and funds for relief; when there was not enough food to eat, the government led us to grow high-yielding Victory No. 100 sweet potatoes; when the technology was not good, the government led us to improve the technology; especially this spring, with the implementation of rational close planting and rational fertilization, the crops grew particularly well." The team members used their own experiences to summarize the benefits of the state's leadership and support for farmers' production, and realized that: without the people's own state power, the production and life of the peasants would not be good, let alone so good so quickly. Everyone truly felt the lovability of their own country in their hearts.

(2) From the facts of the support of industry to agricultural production and the changes in the prices of industrial and agricultural products in recent years, the relationship between industry and agriculture was understood, and the idea of the worker-peasant alliance was strengthened. They recalled that: in the past, the things used for planting crops were expensive and scarce, and difficult to buy; but the things produced in the farmland were cheap and difficult to sell. With the development of national industry, the prices of industrial products have gradually decreased and gradually increased; the prices of agricultural products have risen steadily and are easy to sell. In this way, agricultural production has developed rapidly, and the lives of peasants have also improved. Team member Li Hengrui said: "In the past, every household used shovels that were half worn out, and they couldn't buy new ones, or they were very expensive; now there are more shovels and the price is cheaper. In the past, there were cutworms in the fields, and we were anxious, one jin of arsenic was 32,000 yuan, and we couldn't buy it, now it's 8,000 yuan a jin, and we can buy as much as we need; in the past, we couldn't buy fertilizer even if we had money, now it's cheap and convenient to buy fertilizer. It is because industry helps us everywhere that our crops grow stronger every year." Li Hengzhang said: "Two years ago, one jin of wheat sold for 800 yuan, and one jin of kerosene cost 8,000 yuan. Now one jin of wheat sells for more than 1,000 yuan, and one jin of kerosene has fallen to 4,800 yuan. Last year, 100 jin of wheat could be exchanged for 2 zhang 6 chi of cloth, but this year only 80 jin are needed. This reversal is of great benefit to us farmers!" Through such recollection and comparison, the team members understood even more that in order to make production and life better, it is necessary to support national industrial construction well.

(3) From the fact that prices have been increasingly stable in recent years, the significant role of continuing to support the government in stabilizing prices for the steady rise of farmers' production and life was understood. Team member Zhao Hanyan said: "In the past, prices rose and fell suddenly, and farmers suffered a lot. In 1949, the money I sold a fat pig for in the first market was not enough to buy a small pig in the second market. Now that prices are stable, we will never suffer that kind of loss again." Li Hengrui said: "The salt in the cooperative always sells for 1,000 yuan a jin. During the continuous rainy days in summer, the cooperative ran out of salt, and the merchants' salt in the market immediately rose to 2,000 yuan a jin. If the cooperative has more salt in stock, we will never suffer that kind of loss again. We must sell our surplus grain to the state. If the state has enough grain and other materials, prices can be stabilized." Everyone talked and realized the benefits of price stability for the peasants; they realized that the reason for price stability was the strong economic strength of the country and the development of industrial and agricultural production; and they realized that in order to maintain price stability, it is necessary to strive to develop production and sell more grain to the state to support national construction.

(4) After the ideological awareness was improved a step further, everyone calculated the comparative account of "is it better to hoard and wait for the price, or to sell grain quickly to expand production investment", and understood that "turning dead things into living things" is of great significance for expanding one's own production and supporting national construction. Team member Ren Hefu said: "If we store wheat at home, it will delay our own expansion of production and affect national construction. Even if we can sell it for a few more dollars in the future, it is not worthwhile. For example: I can now have 50 jin of wheat left over. After selling it to the state, in addition to exchanging some cloth to add clothes, I can also exchange it for 100 jin of dry manure, which can produce more than 60 jin of wheat in the field, and earn 25 jin dry besides the principal. In this way, I will produce more grain and support national construction. It is really a double-edged sword." After such a calculation, everyone's enthusiasm for loving the country and increasing production was even greater, and they made plans to sell wheat or store wheat in the cooperative to expand production investment. Li Fengyi wanted to deposit 200 jin of wheat in the cooperative, preparing to add some money later to buy a livestock; Ren Hexi and Li Hengrui wanted to deposit wheat in the cooperative, preparing to buy brooms, hoes, and bean cakes. Every household voluntarily sent the surplus wheat to the cooperative. Everyone plans to buy a livestock, 150 jin of bean cakes, 2,000 jin of dry manure, three chisels, and four hoes, to ensure processing and fertilization, grow wheat well, and produce more grain.

    山东莱阳李凤义互助组进行政治思想教育推动售粮的经验
    中共莱阳地委会
    编者按：昨天本报第二版登载的题为“两个好经验”的经济工作述评中，介绍了收购小麦的两个经验。其中山西太谷的经验已与该经济工作述评同时发表了，现在再把山东莱阳李凤义互助组的经验发表在这里。
    山东莱阳县李家窑村李凤义互助组的全体组员
    （共十户），经过几年来的劳动互助，生产逐年提高，生活也逐步改善了。现在全组总共有一匹马，一头驴，三头牛；从春天到现在喂出十口肥猪。除
    一户稍有困难以外，其余各户都过着中农生活。但由于对他们进行政治教育不够，组员普遍有“只顾个人生产，不管国家建设”的思想。今年麦收以后，家家都存着小麦，却不肯卖给国家，想等待更高的价钱。秋苞米需要追肥了，不肯卖麦子买肥料，还向国家贷了三百斤肥田粉。组长李凤义种着十几亩地，没有牲口，想买一头驴；可是，总想着麦子将来会涨价，所以有麦子也放着不卖。别的组员的情形也都差不多。这就妨碍了农业生产的扩大；对国家不利，对农民自己也不好。
    李凤义到乡里参加了互助代表会议，经过干部讲解，把这道理弄明白了。他回到家里以后，就召开全体组员会议，发动大家讨论，把他明白了的道理和组里的具体情况结合起来进行爱国主义教育，从多方面提高大家的政治觉悟：
    （一）从总结生产、分析生产成绩的来源，说明了国家与农民的关系，把个人利益和国家利益统一起来。组员任德说：“我的庄稼从来没有长得像今年的这样强。过去我没有牲口，也没有猪，现在有一头大牛，两头肥猪。一九五一年我打了八斗小麦，一九五二年打了一石，今年打了一石五，一年比一年多。”“我过去也是年年出大力，可是干一年穷一年。自从共产党来了，我才步步好了。过去我没有土地，土地改革后分到了地；牲畜劳力不足，组织互助组解决了困难；缺农具、种籽，政府贷款帮助；有了灾荒，政府发粮、发款救济；粮食不够吃，政府领导咱种产量很大的胜利百号地瓜（红薯）；技术不好，政府又领导咱们改进技术；尤其是今年春天，实行了合理密植、合理施肥，庄稼长得特别强。”组员们纷纷用亲自体验，总结了国家对农民的生产的领导、扶持的好处，认识到：如果没有人民自己的国家政权，农民的生产、生活就不会好起来，更不会好得这样快。大家从思想上真正感到了自己的国家的可爱。
    （二）从几年来工业对农业生产的支援和工业农业产品价格的变化的事实，明白了工业和农业的关系，加强了工农联盟的思想。他们回忆到：过去种庄稼用的东西又贵又缺，不好买；庄稼地里出产的东西却又贱又不好卖。国家工业发达了，工业品的价格逐步降低，而且渐渐多了起来；农产品价格稳步上升，而且容易卖出。这样，农业生产发展得快了，农民生活也改善了。组员李恒瑞说：“从前家家都是用的磨掉了一半的锨，买新的买不着，买着也贵得很；现在锨也多了，价也贱了。过去地里有蛴螬，干着急，一斤信石（砒）三万二千元，还买不着，现在八千元一斤，需要多少有多少；过去有钱也买不着肥田粉，现在买肥田粉又贱又方便。就因为工业处处帮助咱，咱的庄稼才一年比一年长得强。”李恒章说：“前年卖一斤小麦八百元，买一斤火油八千元。现在一斤小麦卖到一千多元，一斤火油落到四千八百元。去年一百斤小麦可以换二丈六尺布，今年只用八十斤就行了。这一反一正，对咱庄稼人有多大好处！”这样一回忆、对比，组员们就更明白了要把生产、生活搞得更好，非好好支援国家工业建设不行。
    （三）从几年来物价日趋稳定的事实，明白了继续支持政府稳定物价对农民的生产、生活稳步上升的重大作用。组员赵汉彦说：“过去的物价忽涨忽落，农民不知吃了多少亏。一九四九年我头一集卖了一头肥猪的钱，到第二集买一头小猪还不够。现在物价稳定了，再也不吃那样的亏了。”李恒瑞说：“合作社的盐，老是卖一千元一斤。夏天下连阴雨，合作社没了盐，市场上商人的盐马上涨到二千元一斤。如果合作社存盐多，咱再不能吃那样亏。咱多余的粮食一定要卖给国家，国家有了足够的粮食和别的物资，物价就能稳定。”大家一谈，都认识了物价稳定对农民的好处；认识了物价稳定的原因是国家经济力量强大了，工农业生产发展了；认识了要保持物价稳定就必须努力发展生产，卖给国家更多的粮食支援国家建设。
    （四）在思想觉悟提高了一步以后，大家又计算了一下“惜售待价好还是快些卖了粮食扩大生产投资好”的对比帐，明白了“把死物变活物”对扩大自己的生产和支援国家建设都有重大意义。组员任和福说：“咱把麦子存在家里，耽误了自己扩大生产，还影响了国家建设，即使将来能多卖几个钱，也不合算。比如：我手里现在可以剩余的小麦有五十斤，卖给国家以后，除换回一些布添置衣服以外，还能换回一百斤大粪干，上在地里就能多产六十多斤小麦，除了本还干赚二十五斤。这样，自己多打了粮食，还支援了国家建设，真是一举两得。”这样一算帐，大家爱国增产的劲头就更大了，纷纷作出卖出小麦或者把小麦存到合作社以扩大生产投资的打算。李凤义要存到合作社二百斤小麦，准备以后再添上些钱买一头牲口；任和喜、李恒瑞都要把小麦存到合作社里，准备买扫帚、镢头、豆饼。家家都自愿地把剩余的小麦送到合作社去了。大家打算买的东西共有牲口一头，豆饼一百五十斤，大粪干二千斤，鑱头三个，镢头四个，保证加工增肥，种好小麦，打更多的粮食。
