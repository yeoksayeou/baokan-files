More than 1,000 people attended the banquet.

Also invited to attend were Gan Yetao, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Korea, and diplomatic envoys from the Soviet Union and other countries stationed in Korea.

On the Korean side, those present to accompany the guests included Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Park Jung-ae and Kim Il, Vice-Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Vice-Premiers of the Cabinet Choi Yong-kun and Hong Myung-hee, heads of various party, government, and military departments, and leaders of various democratic parties and social organizations.

At the beginning of the banquet, Premier Kim Il-sung delivered a speech. First, on behalf of the Korean people, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Korean People's Army, he expressed his heartfelt and warm gratitude for the kind regards of the Third Chinese People's 慰问 (Comfort) Delegation to Korea.

Premier Kim Il-sung said: The victory achieved by the Korean people in the Fatherland Liberation War was achieved with the full support and solidarity of the worldwide democratic camp, headed by the Soviet Union, and all peace-loving forces. The 500 million Chinese people share life and death and help us with blood, truly demonstrating a new example of proletarian internationalism. The great and brilliant achievements established by the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army will never be forgotten by the Korean people.

Premier Kim Il-sung added: The arduous task facing the Korean people after the armistice is to begin restoring and building the people's economy destroyed in the war, stabilizing the people's lives, and striving for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue on the basis of national reunification. Although the American aggressor forces are still hindering the thorough implementation of the armistice agreement, attempting to undermine Korea's reconstruction and reunification efforts, the Korean people will surely overcome all difficulties and victoriously complete the future economic construction tasks.

Premier Kim Il-sung continued: The visit of the Chinese People's 慰问 (Comfort) Delegation to Korea during the war encouraged the fighting will of the Korean and Chinese People's Forces and consolidated the Korean people's confidence in victory. This time, the enthusiastic activities of the delegation comrades will further consolidate the friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese peoples and enable the Korean people to achieve greater achievements in the struggle to restore the post-war people's economic construction. The Korean people express infinite joy at the tremendous achievements made by China in implementing the Five-Year Plan and hope that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, will victoriously build a prosperous and powerful New China.

Premier Kim Il-sung concluded: I believe that the Korean and Chinese peoples will surely further strengthen the friendship and solidarity forged in blood in the anti-American struggle in the future, and achieve greater victories in the cause of defending the freedom and security of Korea and China, as well as peace in Asia and the world. I propose a toast first to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, the wise leader of the great Chinese people and the close friend of the Korean people!

The banquet was held in an atmosphere filled with the profound friendship of internationalism. During the banquet, the guests frequently toasted to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, Marshal Kim Il-sung, and the leaders of the Soviet government headed by Chairman Malenkov, and to the unbreakable friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese peoples.

After the banquet, the Korean National Art Theater and the Chinese People's Third 慰问 (Comfort) Delegation Art Troupe performed wonderful programs, and a dance was held.
