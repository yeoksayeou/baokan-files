    【Report from this newspaper】After the Central People's Government and the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated four documents concerning ethnic issues, including the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China," in August 1952, in order to further implement the ethnic policies, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued a notice on studying ethnic policies on August 18. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) instructed the Party committees of relevant regions in September to conduct a thorough and systematic inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies, in accordance with the Government Administration Council's notice and in conjunction with the study of ethnic policies. Subsequently, all relevant regions across the country carried out this inspection successively. Prior to this, the Xinjiang Branch of the CPC Central Committee convened the Second Xinjiang Party Congress in July 1952 to review and criticize the shortcomings and errors in the implementation of ethnic policies in the past. The Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region conducted an inspection against Han chauvinism in the first half of 1952. The nationwide inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies has lasted for a year and has now been successfully concluded.
    The Party committees and People's Governments of all relevant regions have generally attached great importance to this inspection. The relevant CPC Central Bureaus, Branch Bureaus, and Provincial and Municipal Party Committees, in accordance with the Central Committee's instructions, conducted research and arrangements based on local conditions, and guided their subordinates to conduct the inspection conscientiously. In addition to holding cadre meetings for inspection, the Party committees and People's Governments of relevant regions, such as Southwest and South China, adopted methods such as convening ethnic work conferences and minority ethnic representative symposiums. Senior Party committees and People's Governments in Central South, Northwest, East China, and North China regions sent visiting groups, work teams, or special personnel to go deep into the lower levels to help conduct inspections. Most regions have summarized the inspection results in a timely manner and reported to the higher-level Party committees and People's Governments.
    According to the situation in most regions, the inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies has generally been carried out in a relatively widespread and in-depth manner. In the inspection, all regions have generally conducted criticism and self-criticism in conjunction with the study of ethnic policies, summarized experiences and lessons, and resolved a number of prominent issues. This has corrected policies, educated cadres, and improved work, creating favorable conditions for further implementing ethnic policies and doing a good job in ethnic work in the future. Through this inspection, the Party committees and People's Governments of some relevant regions that did not pay enough attention to ethnic issues in the past could not help but be greatly surprised by the many serious problems revealed in the inspection, and thus paid attention to ethnic work. For the Party committees and People's Governments of relevant regions that already attached importance to ethnic issues, this inspection aroused greater vigilance and deepened understanding.
    The results of this inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies in various regions prove that the tasks, ethnic policies, and work guidelines and steps under different circumstances in different ethnic groups, stipulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao regarding the ethnic issue in China, are completely correct and completely necessary. The implementation of the Central Committee's ethnic policies by the relevant regions is also basically correct. Therefore, in the past three years, our country's ethnic work has achieved great and significant achievements, thereby strengthening and consolidating ethnic unity and enhancing the patriotic enthusiasm of all minority ethnic groups, laying a good foundation for further implementing the Party's ethnic policies and further strengthening and consolidating ethnic unity in the future.
    However, in this inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies in various regions, many shortcomings and errors still exist in current ethnic relations and work, some of which are quite serious. First, Han chauvinism and remnants of Han chauvinism exist among some Han cadres and Han people. People with Han chauvinism look down on minority ethnic groups, do not treat minority ethnic groups with equality, and, in the most serious cases, discriminate against minority ethnic groups and seriously infringe upon the rights of minority ethnic people. This is specifically manifested in three aspects: First, they do not respect the religious beliefs, customs, habits, and languages and scripts of minority ethnic groups, and even infringe upon the rights of minority ethnic groups in this regard. For example, Han cadres in Yuxiu and Caoying Townships in Xingwen County, Sichuan Province, once prohibited Miao people from speaking the Miao language. During the land reform in Gusong and Baila Townships, Han cadres forced Miao women to cut their hair and change into Han clothing. Similar phenomena have also occurred in some counties in Guizhou Province and Hunan Province. In areas where Hui and Han people live together in Henan and Anhui Provinces, some Han cadres ridiculed Hui people for not eating pork as "backward." Second, they neglect or even infringe upon the economic interests of minority ethnic people. In some counties in Guizhou and Guangxi Provinces, Tai'an County in Shandong Province, Jingyuan County in Gansu Province, Lanxi County in Zhejiang Province, and other places, during the land reform, some Han district and township cadres did not treat local minority ethnic groups with equality, giving minority ethnic groups less land, bad land, or even no land. In some areas, when distributing relief funds and loans, they gave minority ethnic groups less, less loans, or even no funds or loans, and arbitrarily misappropriated or froze special funds allocated by the central government to minority ethnic groups. For example, the minority ethnic education subsidy in Guangxi Province had an accumulated amount of over 38 percent that was turned over to the higher authorities in 1952. Third, they look down on minority ethnic cadres, do not respect the authority of minority ethnic cadres, and some Han cadres even monopolize affairs, act arbitrarily, and exclude minority ethnic cadres at will, which is a fairly common phenomenon in some autonomous regions. In this inspection, it was also revealed that narrow-minded nationalism existed to a considerable extent among minority ethnic cadres.
    Secondly, some cadres are impatient and rash in ethnic work and mechanically apply the experience of Han areas. Some cadres, in violation of the central government's cautious and steady approach, disregarding the characteristics and actual conditions of the current stage of development of minority ethnic groups, impatiently attempt to carry out certain reform work that does not have the necessary conditions, and indiscriminately apply the experience of Han areas, even applying the experience of organizing farmers' associations in Han agricultural areas to establish autonomous regions. Some places even mechanically apply the experience of one minority ethnic area to another minority ethnic area with different circumstances, resulting in serious errors.
    Thirdly, there is coercion and commandism and violations of laws and discipline by grassroots cadres. Although the coercion and commandism style of grassroots cadres is partial and individual, it is serious. It occurs in grain requisition, taxation, and even in medical treatment, trade, loans, and savings for minority ethnic groups, with phenomena such as forced vaccinations, forced sales of goods to the masses, and forced loans and exchange of silver ornaments. Violations of laws and discipline are also serious in some areas: some cadres arbitrarily arrest and beat people, causing great dissatisfaction among minority ethnic groups. The above errors are inseparable from bureaucratism in leadership.
    In the inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies, Party committees and People's Governments at all levels attached great importance to the revealed shortcomings and errors, conducted in-depth education among cadres, and adopted various methods with a serious and responsible attitude to correct them. Before the inspection, some counties in Guizhou, Sichuan, Hunan, and other places had a very small number of Han cadres who prohibited minority ethnic groups from speaking their own languages and forced minority ethnic groups to cut their hair and change their clothes. These errors have now been corrected. The Zhengzhou Central Branch of the People's Bank of China found that the loans given to minority ethnic groups in 1952 had not yet been issued, and immediately issued them together with this year's loans. The People's Bank of China's Longsheng County Branch in Guangxi Province forced the exchange of silver ornaments from minority ethnic groups. After inspection, the silver ornaments have been returned to the minority ethnic groups as much as possible. The legacy issues of land reform have been or are being addressed in many areas. The issue of minority ethnic cadres in some autonomous regions having positions and power has been properly resolved or is being resolved. Because minority ethnic cadres have positions and power, their enthusiasm for work has been greatly increased, and unity with Han cadres has been further strengthened. A new atmosphere has emerged in the work of autonomous regions. Many relevant senior Party committees and People's Governments have drawn experience from the inspection: it is necessary to strengthen education on ethnic policies for cadres, strengthen investigation and research, strictly implement the system of requesting instructions and reporting, and regularly inspect the implementation of ethnic policies in order to prevent and timely discover and correct deviations and errors in work. To this end, the Party committees and governments of many relevant regions have formulated various necessary systems and measures to inspect the implementation of ethnic policies. However, this inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies is not balanced enough. Some relevant Party committees, especially some relevant business departments, have not conducted the inspection seriously and in a timely manner in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee. The inspection in some areas is not thorough enough, and some of the shortcomings and errors found have not been seriously corrected. These must be effectively remedied.

    为进一步加强和巩固全国各民族的团结
    各地应深入贯彻民族政策
    【本报讯】在一九五二年八月，中央人民政府及中央人民政府政务院公布了“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”等四个有关民族问题的文件之后，为了进一步贯彻民族政策，中央人民政府政务院于八月十八日发出了关于学习民族政策的通知，中共中央于九月间指示各有关地区的党委，依照政务院的通知，结合民族政策的学习，深入地、系统地进行一次民族政策执行情况的检查。随后，全国各有关地区都先后进行了此项检查。在此以前，中共中央新疆分局于一九五二年七月间召开全疆第二届党代表会议，检查并批判了已往在执行民族政策中的缺点和错误。西康藏族自治区于一九五二年上半年进行了反对大民族主义的检查。全国各地民族政策执行情况的检查，时经一年，现已胜利结束。
    各有关地区的党委和人民政府对于此次检查，大都给予了极大的重视。各有关的中共中央局、分局和省、市党委遵照中央指示，根据各地情况，分别进行了研究和布置，并指导所属认真地进行了检查。各有关地区的党委和人民政府，除了召开干部会议进行检查以外，如西南和华南等地采取了召开民族工作会议、少数民族代表座谈会等方式，中南、西北、华东、华北等地区的高级党委和人民政府派出了访问团、工作组或专人，深入下层，帮助进行检查。各地对检查结果大都及时进行了总结，向上级党委和人民政府作了报告。
    依据大多数地区的情况看来，民族政策执行情况的检查，一般地都进行得比较普遍和深入。各地在检查中，大都从新结合学习民族政策，进行了批评和自我批评，并总结了经验教训，解决了若干突出的问题，从而端正了政策，教育了干部，改进了工作，为今后进一步贯彻民族政策，做好民族工作，创造了有利条件。经过这次检查，使若干过去对民族问题重视不够的有关地区的党委和人民政府，不能不由于在检查中所揭发出来的许多严重问题大吃一惊，因而重视了民族工作。对于原来就已重视民族问题的有关地区的党委和人民政府，经过了这次检查，则更加引起了警惕，加深了认识。
    这次各地检查民族政策执行情况的结果，证明党中央和毛主席所规定的党在中国国内民族问题方面的任务、各项民族政策以及在不同民族中不同情况下的各项工作方针与工作步骤是完全正确的，完全必要的，各有关地区执行中央的民族政策基本上也是正确的，因而三年多来，我们国家的民族工作获得了巨大的、显著的成就。从而加强和巩固了民族团结，提高了各少数民族的爱国主义热情，为今后进一步贯彻党的民族政策，进一步加强和巩固民族团结打下了良好的基础。
    但是，这次各地在进行检查民族政策执行情况中，也发现了在当前民族关系和工作中还存在着许多缺点和错误，有些甚至相当严重。首先是在一部分汉族干部和汉族人民中存在着大汉族主义思想和大汉族主义残余思想。有大汉族主义思想的人看不起少数民族，不以平等的精神对待少数民族，最严重的是歧视少数民族，严重地侵犯少数民族人民的权利。具体表现在三个方面：一、不尊重少数民族的宗教信仰、风俗习惯和语言、文字，甚至侵犯少数民族在这方面的权利。例如四川省兴文县毓秀、曹营两乡汉族干部曾禁止苗族群众说苗话。古宋、白腊乡土地改革时，汉族干部曾强迫苗族妇女剪发和改穿汉装。贵州省和湖南省有些县份也发生类似现象。河南、安徽等省回汉杂居地区，有些汉族干部讥讽回民不吃猪肉是“落后”。二、忽视甚至侵害少数民族人民的经济利益。贵州省和广西省的某些县，山东省泰安县、甘肃省靖远县、浙江省兰溪县等地在土地改革中，有些汉族区、乡干部不以平等精神对待当地少数民族，给少数民族少分田、分坏田、甚至不分田。有些地区在发放救济款和贷款时，对少数民族少发、少贷甚至不发、不贷，对中央拨给少数民族的专款，随便挪用、冻结。如广西省少数民族教育补助费，一九五二年积压上缴的就达百分之三十八以上。三、看不起少数民族干部、不尊重少数民族干部的职权，有些汉族干部甚至包办代替，独断专行，并随便排斥少数民族干部，这在若干自治区是相当普遍地存在着的现象。在这次检查中，也暴露出在少数民族干部中，相当多地存在着狭隘的民族主义思想。
    其次是部分干部在民族工作中的急躁冒进和机械地搬用汉族地区经验。有些干部违背中央慎重稳进的方针，不顾少数民族当前发展阶段的特点和实际情况，急躁地试图进行某些不具备条件的改革工作，并把汉族地区的经验到处乱套，甚至有的把汉族农业地区土地改革的经验搬用于少数民族牧业区，把汉族土地改革中组织农会的作法搬用来建立自治区。有些地方还把这一少数民族地区的经验，机械地搬用于另一情况不同的少数民族地区，结果造成了严重的错误。
    第三是基层干部的强迫命令以及违法乱纪。基层干部的强迫命令作风虽然是部分的、个别的，但却是严重的。它在征粮、税收等项工作中，甚至在对少数民族进行医疗、贸易、贷款、储蓄等项工作中，也发生强迫打防疫针，强迫群众推销货物，强迫贷款和兑换银首饰等现象。违法乱纪在若干地区也很严重：有的干部随便捕人、打人，引起少数民族很大的不满。以上的错误是和领导上的官僚主义分不开的。
    在进行民族政策执行情况的检查中，各级党委和人民政府对于揭发出来的缺点和错误，十分重视，在干部中深入地进行了教育，并以严肃认真的态度，采取各种办法进行了纠正。贵州、四川、湖南等地在进行检查前，有些县的很少数的汉族干部禁止少数民族说本民族语言、强迫少数民族剪发、改装的错误，现在已经得到纠正。中国人民银行郑州中心支行检查发现一九五二年给少数民族的贷款还未发出，当即连同今年的贷款一齐发出。中国人民银行广西省龙胜县支行强迫收兑少数民族银首饰事件，经检查后，已尽量将银首饰退还少数民族。土地改革的遗留问题，许多地区已经或正在着手解决。若干自治区的少数民族干部有职有权问题，已经得到妥善的解决或正在解决中。少数民族干部因为有职有权，工作积极性大大提高，与汉族干部进一步加强了团结，自治区的工作出现了新的气象。许多有关的高级党委和人民政府从检查中得出经验：必须加强对干部民族政策的教育，加强调查研究工作，严格请示报告制度，经常地检查民族政策执行情况，以便防止和及时发现、纠正工作中的偏差和错误。为此，许多有关地区的党委和政府，已订出各项必要的制度和办法，来检查民族政策执行的情况。但是，这次对民族政策执行情况的检查，还不够平衡，若干有关的党委特别是若干有关的业务部门没有及时地按照中央的指示认真进行检查，若干地区的检查还不够深入，对于检查出来的缺点和错误，有的还没有认真纠正，这些都必须切实地进行补救。
