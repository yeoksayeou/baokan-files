Huainan Mining Bureau Jiulonggang Coal Mine's Former Director Xie Nan (Party Branch Secretary) and other leading cadres such as Sun Jinqing, Sun Jimin, and Zhao Chunzhi from the 330-meter level area of the mine, were found to have falsely reported five times that the National Day First Team and Second Team had successively created new national records for collective coal mining efficiency. The Anhui Provincial Party Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission and the Anhui Provincial People's Government's People's Supervision Commission are seriously handling this incident of deceiving the Party and the country.

From 1951 to April 1952, the Jiulonggang Coal Mine of the Huainan Mining Bureau reported to higher authorities five times that the National Day First Team and Second Team under its jurisdiction had "created new national records for collective coal mining efficiency," and received commendations and rewards from higher leading organs. The first time was on April 26, 1951, reporting that the National Day First Team had created a new national record of 11.851 tons for collective coal mining efficiency; the second time was on December 24, 1951, reporting that the National Day First Team had created a new national record of 18.194 tons for collective coal mining efficiency; the third time was on March 4, 1952, reporting that the National Day First Team had created a new national record of 19.006 tons for collective coal mining efficiency; the fourth time was on March 8, 1952, reporting that the National Day Second Team had created a new national record of 19.447 tons for collective coal mining efficiency; the fifth time was on April 21, 1952, reporting that the National Day Second Team had created a new national record of 20.049 tons for collective coal mining efficiency. However, according to an inspection by the Huainan Municipal Party Committee's inspection team in March of this year: In recent years, thanks to the creativity and enthusiasm of all employees, the Jiulonggang Coal Mine has made achievements in production, and daily coal mining efficiency and production quotas have continued to rise, especially in the high-step coal mining method, which has been even more innovative. However, under the erroneous leadership of former mine director Xie Nan, a small number of cadres, for the sake of personal fame and gain, used the workers' production achievements to falsely report production records. The above-mentioned five so-called new national records for collective coal mining efficiency were all falsely reported. The first new national record for collective coal mining efficiency was "created" in this way: In April 1951, the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government convened a national coal mine conference. Before going to Beijing to attend the conference, Xie Nan, the then director of the Jiulonggang Coal Mine, personally arranged for the National Day First Team in the 330-meter area under his jurisdiction to choose good coal mining conditions. After considerable preparation, a shock production method using brute force was adopted to "create" a new national record for collective coal mining efficiency, in preparation for bringing it to the conference as a "gift" and to "create" it on the day of his departure. Later, because the working surface of the third shift of the National Day First Team did not meet the standards during the execution of the above-mentioned "task," an accident occurred and it was not "created." After Xie Nan arrived in Beijing, he repeatedly wrote letters urging the reporting of the new record, saying that "the conference is very interested in the new record of collective coal mining efficiency," and encouraging continued "creation" of a new record of coal mining efficiency. Sun Jimin, the captain of the National Day First Team of the 330-meter area at the time, Sun Jinqing, the chairman of the trade union and secretary of the Communist Youth League branch (a Communist Party member), Sun Duojing, the acting chief engineer of the Jiulonggang Coal Mine, and others, based on Xie Nan's intentions, further mobilized and arranged to adopt the above method to "create" a new record. On the day before "creating" the new record, that is, on April 25, Sun Jinqing knew that it would be difficult to create a new record based on the current situation, so he arranged for recorder Li Yanghou to record four fewer workdays for each shift on the day of "creating" the new record, and asked Li Yanghou to notify the recorder of the next shift to also record four fewer workdays. There were sixty-seven people working on the working face that day, but when calculating efficiency, it was calculated according to forty-seven people (because four fewer workdays were recorded for each shift, twelve fewer workdays were recorded for three shifts, and eight people who worked continuous shifts were not recorded). Because the numbers had not yet reached the requirements for "creating" a new record, Sun Jinqing and Sun Jimin asked recorder Wang Jiamin to alter the original records three times, and as a result, the so-called new national record of 11.851 tons of collective coal mining efficiency appeared, deceiving the leading organs and obtaining commendations and rewards. At that time, Sun Jimin and others also falsely reported to Chairman Mao in the name of the workers to report the good news. In fact, according to the actual coal production of 404.66 tons received by the production and sales department that day, the actual collective coal mining efficiency was 6.039 tons, calculated with all 67 people on the working face. The "creation" process of the third 19.006-ton national collective coal mining efficiency new record was as follows: In March 1952, under the leadership of Zhao Chunzhi, the party branch secretary at the time, the 330-meter area passed a resolution to have the National Day First Team "create" a new record, and formulated a plan for the National Day First Team to "create" a new record. A total of thirty-three people from the National Day First Team participated in the "creation" of the new record this time. In addition, cadres from the party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League in the coal mining area also participated in helping to push carts, transport materials, and watch small eyes. However, the actual coal mining efficiency that day was only 8.8 tons. In order to create the so-called "new record," Zhao Chunzhi asked squad leader Lu Nan to alter the numbers three times, changing the number of people participating in the "creation" of the new record on the working face to twenty, and not calculating the output based on the actual coal production number of 290.8 tons received by the production and sales department that day, but calculating the output based on the non-compliant so-called underground coal mining footage number, falsely reporting the output as 380.12 tons, fabricating the number of 19.006 tons, becoming the "third new national record of collective coal mining efficiency." After this new record was "created," Zhao Chunzhi asked Lu Nan to report the good news to Chairman Mao and leaders at all levels in the name of the workers. The report was finally revised by Zhao Chunzhi and approved by Deputy Mine Director Gao Pengge (a Communist Party member) and Xie Nan before being sent out. Xinhua News Agency and this newspaper also published this fake new record. As for the "creation" of the other three fake new records, they were all intentionally fabricated by means of undercounting the number of coal miners participating in coal mining, exaggerating coal production, and fabricating numbers out of thin air.

After the launch of the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and regulations, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission, the Anhui Provincial People's Government's People's Supervision Commission, the Huainan Municipal Party Committee, the Huainan Mining Bureau, and the Huainan Municipal Party Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission attached great importance to this issue after being exposed by the mine's employees, and immediately organized an inspection team by units such as the Huainan Municipal Party Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission to conduct an in-depth inspection. Under the leadership of the Jiulonggang Coal Mine Committee of the Communist Party of China, the inspection team learned about the situation and exchanged opinions with cadres, technicians, pneumatic pick operators, recorders, and workers from the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League who had participated in the "creation" of the new record in the past. It also inspected the original production records of the "creation" of the new record in the past, the comparison table of the coal mining area's engineering plan and actual conditions, the production and sales department's production receipt on the day of the "creation" of the new record, the personnel department's report form, the workload record table, and other materials. After repeated verification and analysis, and the result of confronting Xie Nan, who was transferred back from Jinan (he was transferred to work in Jinan this spring), it was proved that the above-mentioned five national collective coal mining efficiency new records were all fake reports fabricated out of thin air on the basis of a day of concentrated effort and shock production after considerable preparation.

The Jiulonggang Coal Mine's act of deceiving the Party, the government, and the people is extremely egregious and has caused considerable damage to actual work. The reason why this serious incident was able to occur and was not exposed for a long time is inseparable from the bureaucratic work style of the Huainan Mining Committee and the Mining Bureau's leadership at that time, and more importantly, because Xie Nan had personal egoism, fame and fortune ideology, and was not loyal to the Party in his work. In the process of this inspection and handling, Xie Nan also wanted to shirk responsibility and tried to muddle through, and later admitted his mistakes, but his attitude was also insincere. Finally, he wanted to overturn it. The Huainan Municipal Party Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission and the Huainan Municipal People's Government's People's Supervision Commission have put forward opinions on the handling of the main responsible persons for this fake new record incident, and are reporting to the Anhui Provincial Party Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission and the Anhui Provincial People's Government's People's Supervision Commission for research and handling respectively.

    淮南矿务局九龙岗煤矿前矿长谢楠等领导干部
    五次假报全国采煤集体效率新纪录
    安徽省党政领导机关正在严正处理这一严重事件
    【本报讯】中共安徽省淮南市委在反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争中，揭发并检查了以淮南矿务局九龙岗煤矿前矿长谢楠（党总支书记）及该矿三百三十公尺水平区孙晋清、孙继敏、赵纯知等负责干部为主的、五次假报国庆一队和二队先后创全国采煤集体效率新纪录的严重事件。中共安徽省委纪律检查委员会和安徽省人民政府人民监察委员会正在严肃处理这一欺骗党和国家的事件。
    从一九五一年到一九五二年四月，淮南矿务局九龙岗煤矿曾先后五次向上级报告该矿所属国庆一队和二队“创造了全国采煤集体效率新纪录”，获得了上级领导机关的表扬和奖励。第一次是一九五一年四月二十六日，报国庆一队创造采煤集体效率十一点八五一吨的全国新纪录；第二次是一九五一年十二月二十四日，报国庆一队创造十八点一九四吨全国采煤集体效率新纪录；第三次是一九五二年三月四日报国庆一队创造十九点○○六吨全国采煤集体效率新纪录；第四次是一九五二年三月八日，报国庆二队创造十九点四四七吨全国采煤集体效率新纪录；第五次是一九五二年四月二十一日，报国庆二队创造二十点○四九吨全国采煤集体效率新纪录。但据今年三月间中共淮南市委检查组检查证明：几年来，由于全体职工发扬了创造性与积极性，九龙岗煤矿在生产上是有成绩的，日常采煤效率和生产定额不断上升，特别在高台阶采煤方法上更有创造；可是在原矿长谢楠的错误领导下，少数干部为了个人名利，竟利用工人的生产成就，假报生产纪录，上述五次所谓全国采煤集体效率新纪录都是假报的。第一次全国采煤集体效率新纪录是这样“创造”出来的：一九五一年四月，中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局召开全国煤矿会议，当时的九龙岗煤矿矿长谢楠在去北京出席会议以前，就亲自布置所属三百三十公尺区国庆一队选择好的采煤条件，经过相当准备，采取拚体力的突击生产方式，“创造”全国采煤集体效率新纪录，准备带到会议上去“献礼”，并要在他临走那天“创”好。后来因为国庆一队第三班在执行上述“任务”中，工作面不合规格，出了事故没有“创”成。谢楠到北京后，还数次来信催报新纪录，说“会议对采煤集体效率新纪录很感兴趣”，鼓励继续“创造”采煤集体效率新纪录。当时的三百三十公尺区国庆一队队长孙继敏、工会主席兼团支部书记孙晋清（共产党员）、九龙岗煤矿代理主管工程师孙多晶等人，便根据谢楠的意图，进一步动员布置采用上述办法
    “创造”新纪录。在“创造”新纪录的前一天，即四月二十五日，孙晋清知道根据当时情况，很难创出新纪录，便布置记录员李仰厚在“创造”新纪录那天给各班少记四个工，并要李仰厚通知下一班的记录员也要少记四个工。这天在掌子面工作的是六十七人，但计算效率时，却按四十七人计算（因每班都少记了四个工，三班即少记十二个工，另有八个人打连勤也没有记工）。因数字还没有达到“创造”新纪录的要求，孙晋清和孙继敏又叫记录员王家民三次窜改原始记录，结果便出现了所谓十一点八五一吨的全国采煤集体效率新纪录，骗取了领导机关的表扬和奖励，当时孙继敏等还假借职工名义上书毛主席报喜。其实，按当天产销科实收产煤四百○四点六六吨，以掌子面全员六十七人计算，实际的采煤集体效率是六点○三九吨。第三次十九点○○六吨全国集体采煤效率新纪录的“创造”经过是这样的：一九五二年三月，三百三十公尺区在当时党支部书记赵纯知的领导下，通过了要国庆一队“创造”新纪录的决议，并给国庆一队制订了“创造”新纪录的计划。这次国庆一队参加“创造”新纪录的共有三十三人，另外还有采煤地区的党、行政、工会、青年团的干部，都参加帮助推车、运料、看小眼，但当天的实际采煤效率只有八点八吨。为了创造所谓“新纪录”，赵纯知便叫核算班长鲁南三次窜改数字，将参加掌子面“创造”新纪录的人数改为二十个，并且不根据产销科当天所收的实际产煤数二九○点八吨计算产量，而以不合规定的所谓井下采煤进尺数计算产量，将产量虚报为三八○点一二吨，捏造了十九点○○六吨的数字，成为
    “第三次全国采煤集体效率新纪录”。这次的新纪录“创”出后，赵纯知又叫鲁南以工人名义上书毛主席和各级首长报喜。报喜书最后经赵纯知修改，副矿长高朋格（共产党员）和谢楠批准后发出。新华社和本报，也都发表了这次假的新纪录。至于其他三次假新纪录的“创造”，也都是采取少算参加采煤人数，夸大产煤量，以及凭空虚构数字等办法有意制造出来的。
    反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争开展后，经该矿职工揭发，中共安徽省委纪律检查委员会、安徽省人民政府人民监察委员会暨中共淮南市委、淮南矿务局、淮南市委纪律检查委员会对此问题都极为重视，即由淮南市委纪律检查委员会等单位组织检查组深入检查。在中共九龙岗煤矿委员会领导下，检查组分别向历次参加“创造”新纪录的党、行政、工会、青年团的干部和技术人员、风镐手、记录员与工人了解情况，交换意见，并检查了历次“创造”新纪录的原始生产记录、采煤区工程计划与实际比较表、历次“创造”新纪录当天产销科的收产情况、人事科的报工单、工作量记录表等材料，经过反复的核对分析，并将谢楠由济南调回来（他已在今春调到济南工作）进行对证的结果，证明上述五次全国采煤集体效率新纪录，都是在经过相当准备，集中力量突击生产一天的基础上凭空制造出来的假报告。
    九龙岗煤矿这种欺骗党、政府和人民的行为是极其恶劣的，已给实际工作造成了相当严重的损害。这一严重事件所以能够发生，并在长时期内没有被揭发出来，是与当时中共淮南矿委和矿务局领导上的官僚主义作风分不开的，而更主要的还是由于谢楠存在着个人主义的名利思想，工作中对党不忠诚。在这次检查处理过程中，谢楠还想推卸责任，企图蒙混过去，后来承认了错误，态度也很不老实。最后又想推翻。中共淮南市委纪律检查委员会和淮南市人民政府人民监察委员会，已提出了对这一假新纪录事件主要负责人员的处理意见，正分别报请中共安徽省委纪律检查委员会和安徽省人民政府人民监察委员会研究处理中。
