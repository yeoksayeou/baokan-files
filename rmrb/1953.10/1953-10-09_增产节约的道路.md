    The Road to Increased Production and Economy
    Zhou Zuoxin

    The Shenyang Water Pump Factory, when recently formulating its plan for increased production and economy, decided to produce an additional 432 water pumps for the state. This enormous figure will not be achieved by increasing equipment and manpower, nor by crash programs involving overtime, but by continually improving management and tapping potential.

    From the outset, the Shenyang Water Pump Factory firmly grasped the correct method of increasing production and economy by relying on improved management to tap latent potential. They first studied the shortcomings of the current planning management and found that: First, in the past six months, the factory had learned and created many advanced experiences, and the output of semi-finished products in many types of work had increased many times; however, the increase in finished products was not as great. Second, there were many intermittent working hours in production, and the phenomenon of stopping work and waiting for materials had not been eradicated. From these two aspects, it was clear that the previous work plans were not correct enough and were not thoroughly implemented. Therefore, they decided to further tap potential by inspecting the formulation and implementation of work plans.

    The results of the inspection proved that there were problems in both aspects. First of all, the biggest shortcoming in the preparation of work plans was that it did not fully consider the creativity of the workers. Workers often created or learned new operating methods in their work, so the old work plans were often completely disrupted. Of course, the so-called new working methods did not appear in the whole factory at the same time, but often appeared in a certain department or on a certain component. Under this circumstance, the production command department should have organized other departments to catch up in a timely and rapid manner, but they did not do so. Thus, the following phenomenon inevitably occurred: advanced experience was stifled by ineffective work plans and backward departments.

    The shortcomings of the past work plans did not stop there, the worst thing was that they were not arranged correctly. For example, the process of producing the "guard pipe joint" component should have been to process it first, and then apply black gold plating. However, the work plan scheduled the black gold plating date before the processing date. As a result, the black gold plating workers had to stop work. There were many similar phenomena of intermittent working hours.

    The shortcomings did not stop there. The work plan should have organized all production-related work in the factory together, but their work plan only had the arrangement of production processes; the supply of tools and materials relied only on verbal agreements. Although the tool and material departments also had their own supply plans, they could not adapt to the new situation in production, so the phenomenon of stopping work and waiting for materials often occurred.

    Because the work plan itself was not sound, problems occurred during its implementation. For example, they did not carefully arrange the processes in the work plan, so after the workers received a batch of tasks, they would do whatever they wanted, and as a result, the components that were needed first were not made, and the components that were needed later were already completed. In this way, the situation of being relaxed in the first ten days of the month and rushing in the last ten days appeared. In February, the work plan stipulated that 78 water pumps should be assembled in the first six days, but the actual number was zero, and on the last day the plan was for 25 pumps, but the actual number that entered the warehouse was 117.

    These were the main problems found in this inspection.

    Finding the root of the problem is equal to solving half of the problem. Since the work plan was previously prepared unreasonably, this time it has to be started from here. The whole factory put forward a slogan: "Improve the quality of work plans." At the same time, a work plan preparation regulation and a system for providing work plan preparation materials were formulated. In view of the shortcomings of the previous practice of the production section taking care of the preparation of the plan alone, this time it was changed to a two-stage preparation method, that is, the production section first issued production targets, and the workshop planners specifically arranged the work dates according to the targets and the technical capabilities, labor force situation, equipment maintenance dates, and other new factors of the workshop - the workshop is much more familiar with these situations than the production section - and then submitted them to the production section for balancing to become the monthly work plan. Of course, this plan is much more advanced than before, but the ever-changing situation of the machine industry itself cannot be controlled by such a plan, so they also stipulated that each workshop should formulate three-day plans, five-day plans, and ten-day plans according to their own different situations. This plan can basically cope with all the new situations in the workshop and will not be broken through by sudden factors. In terms of implementation, they also stipulated that each batch of components must be issued a "work ticket" by the dispatching personnel, which basically can control the flow of in-process products and ensure balance.

    At the same time, the work plan is no longer limited to the arrangement of processes, and the materials and tools departments also formulate their own supply plans based on the monthly work plan.

    They have now carried out pilot projects on these reforms in the fourth workshop. The results of the pilot project prove that doing so does greatly improve work efficiency. Based on this successful experiment, the new situation of the improvement of workers' technical level, and other favorable factors such as the gradual simplification of products in the second half of the year, they formulated a plan to increase the production of 432 water pumps. Because this plan is based on facts, although it is not easy, the workers still fully support it and are determined to complete this glorious task. In the recent short few days, the workers of the factory have found 200 more tricks to realize this plan, and have formulated measures plans for their own groups, ensuring that they will do everything possible to realize the new advanced work plan.

    增产节约的道路
    周作新
    沈阳水泵厂最近制订增产节约计划时，决定再为国家多生产四百三十二台水泵。这个庞大的数字，不是靠增加设备和人力，也不是靠加班加点突击，而是从不断改善管理中发掘出来的。
    沈阳水泵厂一开始就紧紧地抓住了依靠改善管理发掘潜在力量进行增产节约的正确方法。他们首先研究目前计划管理上的缺点，发现：第一、半年来全厂学习和创造的先进经验很多，好多工种半成品产量提高了很多倍；但成品增加得却不多。第二、生产上的间断工时很多，停工待料的现象并未根绝。从这两方面来看，显然是过去的作业计划还订得不够正确，执行得也不够彻底。因此他们决定从检查作业计划的制订和执行去进一步挖掘潜在能力。
    检查的结果证明这两方面都有问题。首先，在编制作业计划中，一个最大的缺点是没有充分考虑到工人的创造性。工人在工作中时常创造或学习了新的操作方法，于是旧的作业计划就往往全被冲乱了。当然，所谓新的工作方法并不是在同一时间内在全厂出现，而往往是出现在某一部门或某某一个部件上。在这种情况下，生产的指挥部门应当及时迅速组织其他部门赶上前去，但他们没有这样做。于是就不可避免地产生了这样的现象：先进经验被不起作用的作业计划及落后的部门扼杀了。
    过去作业计划的缺点还不止此，最糟的是编排得不对头。举个例子：本来生产“护管接头”这个部件的工序应该是先加工，后挂乌金。但是作业计划把挂乌金的日期排在加工的日期前边。于是挂乌金的工人只好停工。类似这样间断工时的现象很多。
    缺点还不止此。作业计划应该是把全厂有关生产的工作组织在一起，但是他们的作业计划却只有生产工序的排列；工具、材料供应只靠口头约定。虽然工具、材料部门自己也有供应计划，但不能适应生产上的新情况，于是停工待料现象也就常常发生。
    因为作业计划本身不健全，所以执行时也就发生了问题。比如，他们在作业计划上没有细致地排列工序，因之工人在接受一批任务后，自己愿意干哪样就干哪样，结果先用的部件没做，后要的部件已经生产完了。这样一来，上旬松，下旬赶的情况就出现了。二月份，作业计划规定头六天要装出水泵七十八台，但实际是个零，最末一天计划是二十五台，实际却入库了一百一十七台。
    这就是此次检查出来的主要问题。
    找着问题的根源，就等于把问题解决了一半。过去既然是作业计划编制得不合理，那么这回还得从这里着手。全厂提出了一个口号：“提高作业计划的质量”。同时制订了一项编制作业计划规程和一项提供编制作业计划资料的制度。鉴于以前由生产科一手包办编制计划有那些缺点，这回改成两段编制法，就是先由生产科下达生产指标，车间计划员根据指标和本车间的技术能力、劳动力情况、设备检修日期及其他新的因素等等——这些情况车间要比生产科熟悉得多——具体安排作业日期，然后交到生产科平衡，成为月的作业计划。当然这样的计划是比以前进步多了，但是机器工业本身的千变万化情况也不是这样的计划所能控制得了的，所以他们又规定了各车间根据各自的不同情况定出三日计划、五日计划、十日计划。这个计划基本上可以应付车间里所有的新情况，不致被突然因素所冲破。在执行方面，他们又规定了每一批部件都必须由调度人员签发“工作票”，这样基本上就可以控制住在制品的流转，保证了均衡。
    与此同时，作业计划也不再限于工序的排列了，材料、工具部门根据月的作业计划也订出自己的供应计划来。
    现在他们已就这些改革在第四车间进行了试点。试点的结果证明，这样做，工作效率确是大大提高了。根据这一成功的试验，和工人们技术水平提高的新情况及下半年产品渐趋单纯等有利因素，他们制订出再增产水泵四百三十二台的计划。因为这个计划是有根据的，虽然不算轻松，工人们还是十分拥护，决心要完成这个光荣的任务。在最近短短的几天中，该厂工人们为实现这个计划，又找出了二百个窍门，订成自己小组的措施计划，保证尽一切力量实现新的先进的作业计划。
