Reader's Letters Abstract

    Hebei Provincial Transportation Company, Cangxian Branch, Organizes Farmers in Disaster Areas to Participate in Transportation Production
    Reader Lü Jingwei writes: The Cangxian Branch of Hebei Provincial Transportation Company, despite the shortage of transportation vehicles and difficult transportation conditions, has vigorously organized farmers in disaster areas to participate in transportation. This has not only solved the supply of materials in disaster areas, but also helped some farmers with livestock and carts to overcome their livelihood difficulties during the disaster period.
    This autumn, the Cangxian area suffered from flooding, and some highways were damaged by floods. Most of the goods need to be transported by a combination of water and land transport, and in some places, manual transshipment is required. Therefore, the transportation capacity is particularly insufficient. In order to promptly solve the problem of material supply in the disaster-stricken areas, the company's employees went deep into the rural areas to organize the transportation forces among the masses. From the beginning of August to September 20, a total of more than 2,300 carts (including rubber-tired and iron-sheet carts) and 307 boats were organized to transport more than 16,000 tons of production and living materials such as wheat seeds, grain, and coal into the disaster areas, as well as to transport local products and special products out of the area.
    The task of this work is quite arduous. For example, the distance from Cangxian to Jianguo County is only 30 kilometers, but it requires two cart transports and two boat transports. In order to do this work well, the company set up temporary transportation teams along the river along the highway, specifically to handle transportation matters such as the connection of vehicles and ships and the combination of human and animal power. With the efforts of the staff at the transportation stations under the company, the transportation task was finally completed. This approach is worth referring to by various localities.

    河北省运输公司沧县支公司组织灾区农民参加运输生产
    读者吕景伟来信：河北省运输公司沧县支公司在交通工具缺乏、交通条件困难的情况下，大力组织灾区农民参加运输，这不但解决了灾区的物资供应，同时也帮助了一部分有牲口、大车的农民解决了灾荒期间的生活困难。
    今秋沧县地区发生了水灾，某些公路受到洪水的破坏，大部分货物需经过水陆联运，有的地方还得用人力转运，因此，运输力量感到特别不足。为了及时解决受灾地区的物资供应问题，该公司职工纷纷深入农村组织群众中的运输力量，从八月初到九月二十日，共组织了大车二千三百余辆（包括胶轮和铁皮大车）、船三百零七只，运入灾区麦种、粮食、煤等生产、生活资料以及运出当地土产、特产品共一万六千余吨。
    这项工作的任务相当繁重，如沧县至建国县仅三十公里的路程，须经过两次车运和两次船运。为了做好这项工作，该公司根据当地的具体情况，在贯穿公路的河沿设立了临时运输组，专门办理车船联接以及人力、畜力结合等运输事项，在该公司所属各运输站工作人员的努力下，终于完成了运输任务。这种做法值得各地参考。
