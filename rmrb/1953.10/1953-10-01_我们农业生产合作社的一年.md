Our Agricultural Production Cooperative's Year
Shandong Agricultural Labor Model Lü Hongbin

Over the past year, our nation has achieved new accomplishments in all areas, and our agricultural production cooperatives have been further consolidated and improved.

Looking back on the road we have traveled this year, I feel very excited. Despite severe natural disasters, we still achieved a bumper harvest of wheat and early autumn crops this year. This year's crops suffered from many disasters and diseases. The wheat suffered from the worst frost damage in thirty years and the most serious blight in over a decade. This summer's heavy rainfall caused flooding damage to the autumn crops. In August, soybeans were infested with bean worms. Now we are facing a drought. However, all of this has been overcome by us! We drained the accumulated water, eliminated the insects, and resisted the frost damage and blight. All kinds of crops generally achieved good harvests. The cooperative's 367.8 mu of wheat yielded 70,311 jin and 10 liang, averaging 191 jin and 1 liang per mu, an increase of more than 7 jin per mu compared to last year. The 162.6 mu of spring corn yielded 90,487 jin, averaging 556 and a half jin per mu, an increase of more than 20 jin compared to last year. The 108 mu of sorghum and millet yielded more than 27,600 jin, averaging more than 250 jin per mu. Regardless of the type of crop, the yield exceeded that of the local mutual aid teams. The Communist Party and the People's Government asked us to work hard to increase grain production, support national construction, and improve the lives of the members. We are following this path.

If you ask why we were able to achieve a better harvest this year despite suffering from disasters, the members will answer, "We took the path of the cooperative and listened to the words of the Communist Party." None of our achievements can be separated from our cooperative or from the leadership of the Party and the government. Golden Queen corn is the highest-yielding crop here, producing twice as much grain as sorghum. However, individual farmers have limited capital. Each family can only plant 1.8 mu, so the increase in production is not significant. This year, with the cooperative, we planted 162 mu, more than 3 mu per household, which allowed us to produce more than 30,000 jin more than planting millet and sorghum. In August, during the busy season of harvesting autumn crops and plowing autumn land, soybeans were infested with bean worms, and the soybean leaves were disappearing day by day, threatening to become bare stalks. Some people said, "Bean worms are divine worms, the more you catch, the more there are." We did not believe this. Under the slogan of "harvesting autumn, plowing land, and controlling insects without delay," we mobilized the entire cooperative, men, women, old and young, to basically eliminate the bean worm disaster. Now, the soybeans with many leaves and dense pods around our village all belong to the agricultural production cooperative. Farmers inside and outside the cooperative praise the cooperative's ability. The cooperative's bumper millet harvest this year is also something that the entire village admires. Millet is most afraid of flooding. This year's heavy rainfall caused many to be flooded to death, but only the cooperative's millet survived. The reason is that we planted crops according to the land conditions, planting corn and sorghum on land that was not suitable for millet in the past, and planting all the millet on high ground. It is estimated that this item alone will increase production by more than 15,000 jin. We are organized, have complete tools, strong livestock, and the land is plowed deeply, harrowed finely, and planted at the right time. This is also the reason why we produce more grain than those outside the cooperative.

We also made mistakes and took detours this year. We made the mistake of being impatient and rash, blindly raising donkeys collectively, which caused difficulties in use. Excessive application of commercial fertilizer to wheat led to high costs and less grain distribution. Basic construction was also carried out too hastily and on too large a scale. With the education and assistance of the Party and the sincere criticism of the members, we quickly corrected our mistakes. Over the past year, the cooperative's management has been greatly improved. In terms of work recording, the practice of partially implementing fixed quality, fixed quantity, and piecework payment last year has been extended to the full implementation of fixed quality, fixed quantity, and piecework payment. We established a full-time accountant, improved the financial system, and corrected the chaotic situation. We also improved the method of raising donkeys, saving labor and feed. We stipulated a special responsibility system for storage, making the storage work orderly. We conducted political work in a timely manner through daily production activities and quarterly evaluations and summaries, and improved the ideological awareness of the members. In short, compared to a year ago, our cooperative has taken another step forward and become more consolidated and stronger.

Achievements should not make us complacent. All these achievements are achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government. We also have shortcomings. For various reasons, and also because we did not work hard enough, the wheat production increase plan was not completed, and the autumn crop part of the plan will also not be completed. We know that the country is waiting for us to produce more grain, and the worker brothers need an adequate grain supply. Increasing production, practicing strict economy, supporting national construction, and improving the lives of the members are our long-term tasks in the future, which require us to continue to work hard. When next year's National Day arrives, we will build our cooperative more solid and create more achievements!

    我们农业生产合作社的一年
    山东农业劳动模范　吕鸿宾
    一年来，我们国家的各个方面，都取得了新的成就；我们的农业生产合作社也进一步地巩固和提高了。
    回想一年来走过的路，心里十分兴奋。在自然灾害严重的情况下，今年我们仍然得到了小麦和早秋庄稼的丰收。今年的庄稼多灾多病，小麦受了三十年没有过的冻灾、十几年来最严重的疸病。今年夏季雨水大，秋庄稼受了涝灾。八月份，黄豆生了豆虫。现在又碰上了干旱。但是，这一切都被我们战胜了！我们排除了积水，消灭了虫子，抗住了冻害、疸病，各种庄稼普遍取得了较好的收成。全社的三百六十七点八亩小麦，收了七万零三百一十一斤十两；平均每亩合一百九十一斤一两，比去年每亩增产七斤多。春玉米一百六十二点六亩，收了九万零四百八十七斤，平均每亩五百五十六斤半，比去年增产二十多斤。高粱、谷子一百零八亩，收两万七千六百余斤，平均每亩二百五十多斤。无论那一种作物，产量都超过了当地的互助组。共产党和人民政府要求我们努力增产粮食，支援国家建设，改善社员生活。我们正是照着这条路走的。
    要问今年我们为什么受了灾还能够得到较好的收成，社员们都会回答：“走了合作社的路，听了共产党的话。”我们的成绩，没有一件能够和我们的合作社分开、和党和政府的领导分开。金皇后玉米是我们这里产量最高的一种庄稼，比种高粱能多打一倍粮食。但个人种地时本钱有限，一家只能种一亩八分地，增产不多。今年，我们有了合作社，种了一百六十二亩，一户合三亩多，使我们比种谷子、高粱多打了三万多斤。八月份，正是收大秋、耕秋地的紧张时候，黄豆生了豆虫，豆叶子一天少起一天，眼看要成光秆了。有的人说：“豆虫是神虫，越拿越多。”我们不信这一套，在收秋、耕地、治虫三不误的口号下，经过动员，全社男女老少齐动手，把豆虫灾基本上消灭了。现在我们村庄周围叶子多、荚子密的豆子，都是农业生产合作社的。社里社外的农民口口称赞“合作社有本事”。合作社今年的谷子丰收，也是全村佩服的一件事。谷子这种庄稼最怕涝，今年的雨水大，涝死了很多；唯有社里的没有涝死。原因是我们因地种植了庄稼，把过去种谷子不保收的地种上了玉米、高粱，把谷子全部种在高地上，估计这一项也能增产一万五千多斤。我们组织起来，工具健全，牲畜强壮，土地耕得深，耙得细，种得宜时。这也是我们比社外打粮食多的原因。
    我们在今年一年中，也曾经犯过错误，走过弯路。我们犯了急躁冒进的毛病，盲目地把驴子集体喂养，在使用上发生过困难。小麦施商品肥料过多，以致成本高、分粮少。基本建设也搞得过急过大。经过党的教育帮助和社员的诚恳批评，我们很快就改正了错误。一年来，社的经营管理大大地改进了。记工方面，由去年部分实行定质定量、按件记工，推广到全部实行定质定量、按件记工。我们设立了专职会计，健全了财经制度，纠正了混乱状态。我们还改进了驴子的饲养方法，节省了人工、草料；规定了保管的专责制度，使保管工作有条不紊。我们及时通过日常的生产活动和按季的评比总结，进行了政治工作，提高了社员的思想觉悟。总之，比一年前，我们的合作社是又前进了一步，变得更巩固更坚强了。
    成绩并不能使我们自满。我们这些成绩都是在共产党和人民政府的领导下得来的。我们也还有缺点。因为各种原因，也因为我们努力不够，小麦增产计划没有完成，秋季部分庄稼也完不成计划。我们知道：国家正等待着我们生产更多的粮食，工人兄弟需要充足的粮食供应。增加生产、厉行节约、支援国家建设、改善社员生活，是我们今后长期的任务，需要我们继续努力。在明年国庆节到来的时候，我们将把我们的合作社建设得更巩固，创造更多的成就！
