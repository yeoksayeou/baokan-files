Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 5th: As the fourth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic approaches, the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany issued a letter to the German people on the 3rd, reviewing the achievements of building a new Germany over the past four years and pointing out the path for the people of East and West Germany to fight in the future.

The letter to the German people said, "Our struggle and work have not been easy, but they have been successful. The German Democratic Republic is now a state of workers and peasants resolutely fighting to strengthen peace and establish national unity."

The letter to the people thanked the Soviet government and people for their generous assistance to the German people, enabling the German Democratic Republic to further strengthen the republic, implement the government's new policies at a faster pace, and achieve greater success.

The letter to the people continued: "We will celebrate the fourth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic with intensified efforts and in the spirit of striving to realize the national demand of 'Germans discussing together.' Only through consultation can an all-German provisional government be established with the basic task of holding free and democratic all-German elections, thereby creating the preconditions for establishing a unified, peace-loving, democratic, and independent Germany."

Speaking of future tasks, the letter to the people called on all the people of the republic to intensify their efforts to strengthen the democratic government and successfully and quickly complete the economic plan. The letter to the people said, "The German Democratic Republic is a bastion in the struggle for peace and the democratic unity of Germany, because a strong German Democratic Republic is the best guarantee to smash Adenauer's and American monopoly capital's war plans."

When referring to the successful implementation of the five-year plan for peaceful construction, the letter to the people paid tribute to the workers, peasants, and intellectuals who demonstrated patriotism and labor discipline, and said, "This makes it possible to continuously improve living standards by increasing the production of consumer goods, repeatedly reducing prices, and raising wages. The people's economy of the republic without crises and unemployment is far superior to the economy ruled by monopoly capital. ... With the further development of the new policies, the German Democratic Republic will gradually become an example of a unified, democratic Germany."

    庆祝德意志民主共和国成立四周年
    民主德国全国阵线发表告人民书
    【新华社柏林五日电】在德意志民主共和国建国四周年纪念日就要到来的时候，民主德国全国阵线全国委员会三日发表了告德国人民书，追述四年来建设新德国的成就，并指出东西德的德国人民将来进行斗争的道路。
    告德国人民书说，“我们的斗争与工作不是容易的，但是获得了成功。德意志民主共和国现在是正为加强和平、建立国家统一进行坚决斗争的工人与农民的国家。”
    告人民书中感谢苏联政府与人民给予德国人民的慷慨帮助，使民主德国有可能进一步加强共和国，以更大的速度执行政府的新方针，并获得更大的成就。
    告人民书继续说：“我们要以加紧努力、争取实现‘德国人在一起商量’这一民族要求的精神来庆祝德意志民主共和国建国四周年纪念。只有通过协商，才能成立以举行自由、民主的全德选举为基本任务的全德临时政府，从而为建立一个统一、爱好和平、民主、独立的德国创造先决条件。”
    谈到今后的任务，告人民书号召共和国全体人民加紧努力，以加强民主政府，并成功地、迅速地完成经济计划。告人民书说，“德意志民主共和国是争取和平与德国的民主统一的堡垒，因为一个强大的德意志民主共和国是粉碎阿登纳与美国垄断资本的战争计划的最好保证。”
    告人民书谈到成功地执行和平建设的五年计划时，对表现了爱国主义与劳动纪律的工人、农民和知识分子致敬，并说，“这使得有可能通过增加消费品生产来不断提高生活水平，多次降低物价并提高工资。没有危机和失业的共和国的人民经济，比垄断资本统治的经济要优越许多。……随着新方针的进一步发展，德意志民主共和国将渐渐成为一个统一、民主的德国的范例。”
