Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 2nd – Another five Korean People's Army prisoners of war were handed over to the Korean-Chinese side by Indian custodial forces at Panmunjom this morning. They broke through the control of special agents and demanded repatriation because the explanation work had been repeatedly delayed by the US side, and they could no longer wait. The number of people repatriated before the explanation work began has now reached one hundred and six.

    Choi Nam-sook (transliteration), one of the returning Korean People's Army prisoners of war, told the members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and Indian officers upon arriving at Panmunjom that the incident that occurred yesterday near the hospital camp area was planned by US Army officers and soldiers working in the hospital in the Indian custodial camp; in that incident, one prisoner of war was killed, and several other prisoners of war and some Indian guards were injured. He said: "These Americans have radio receivers, and they have turned the hospital camp area into a command post for directing special agents. Special agents are creating riots in the custodial camps."

    Choi Nam-sook was forced by special agents to act as an interpreter for the eightieth camp in the Indian custodial camp where he was previously located. He said: "The special agents in my camp are now receiving instructions directly from Seoul and Tokyo on how to sabotage the upcoming explanation work through radios smuggled into the camp."

    Another returnee, Han Sang-geo (transliteration), revealed that among the many orders received by the prisoners of war regarding the sabotage of the explanation work, one order stated: "Wear sunglasses during the explanation, wave the flags given to you, and shout and jump as much as possible." He continued: "They also told us that we could feign illness or pretend to urinate to avoid explanation."

    Han Sang-geo said: "In addition to radio instructions, the special agents in the prisoner of war camps are now also receiving orders from other special agents outside the prisoner of war camps." He said that he often saw a South Korean garbage truck driver handing small pieces of paper to the special agents in his camp from outside the barbed wire fence. He continued, saying that after the driver delivered the orders, the special agents' "propaganda team" would immediately hold secret meetings.

    Han Sang-geo said that before the prisoners of war went to the demilitarized zone, Syngman Rhee's special agents told them that they should carry out "riots and mass escapes," or take any steps they deemed necessary to sabotage the Indian custodial camp's explanation work. The special agents said: "The Indian army cannot even touch you. They will do whatever the Americans tell them to do, because all their logistical support is provided by the United Nations Command."

### 我方被俘人员又有五名从印度看管营归来  揭露美方指使特务分子在战俘营制造骚乱

    我方被俘人员又有五名从印度看管营归来
    揭露美方指使特务分子在战俘营制造骚乱
    【新华社开城二日电】又有五名朝鲜人民军被俘人员在今天上午由印度看管部队在板门店交给朝中方面。他们突破特务的控制，要求遣返，因为解释工作已被美方一再拖延，而他们已经等不及了。在解释工作开始以前被遣返的人数，至此已达一百零六名。
    归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员崔南叔（译音）在到达板门店时对中立国遣返委员会委员和印度军官说，昨天在医院营场附近地方发生的事件是在印度看管营的医院中工作的美国陆军官兵策划的；在那次事件中，有一名战俘被打死，另外几名战俘和一些印度卫兵被打伤。他说：“这些美国人带有无线电收音机，他们已把医院营场变成指挥特务的司令部，特务正在看管营中制造暴乱。”
    崔南叔曾被特务强迫充当他先前所在的印度看管营第八十号营场的译员。他说：“我所在的营场中的特务，现在已通过偷运到营场来的收音机，直接从汉城和东京方面获得关于如何破坏即将到来的解释工作的指示。”
    另一个归来人员韩尚居（译音）透露，在战俘们所接到的许多关于破坏解释工作的命令中，有一项命令是这样说的：“在听解释时戴上黑眼镜，挥动发给你们的旗子，尽量大嚷大跳。”他接着说：“他们还对我们说，我们可以装病或假装小便，以躲避解释。”
    韩尚居说：“除了无线电的指示以外，战俘营里的特务现在还从战俘营外面的其他特务那里接到命令。”他说，他常常看到一个南朝鲜的垃圾车司机把小纸片从铁丝网外递给他所在的营场中的特务。他接着说，在这个司机送来命令以后，特务的“宣传小组”就立即举行秘密会议。
    韩尚居说，在战俘们前往非军事区以前，李承晚特务曾对他们说，他们应当进行“暴乱和集体逃跑”，或者采取他们认为必要的任何步骤，以破坏印度看管营的解释工作。特务们说：“印度军队连碰也不能碰你们一下。美国人要他们怎样做他们就怎样做，因为他们的全部后勤支援都是联合国军司令部给予的。”
