Abandoned salt fields in the western Guangdong region, including Cheban in Lianjiang County, Yanting Village in Haikang County, Anli Township in Leidong County, and Bomao, Shatin, Mocun, Sanhewuo, and Nansan in Wuchuan County, have begun resalting since late May this year. Under the active leadership of the Western Guangdong Salt Field Management Office, management agencies (salt affairs offices) have been established in various small salt regions over the past three months. The People's Government has allocated over 1.56 billion yuan in relief funds and various loans to assist impoverished salt farmers in repairing their salt beds and dikes to resume production. Currently, construction on repairing the beds and dikes has been completed in many areas, and resalting has commenced. The salt beds and dikes that have not yet been repaired are being expedited for restoration and will soon produce salt. In Leidong County, the Southeast and Anli townships have repaired eight salt beds and two crystallization ponds, producing over 900 dan of salt after resalting; other salt beds and dikes are being rushed for repair in an effort to resume resalting as soon as possible. In Mocun, Wuchuan County, over 950 sand beds (for producing refined salt) have resumed production. In other refined salt areas, such as Bomao, Shatin, and Cheban in Lianjiang County, over 200 stoves have been restored, with an average daily production of about 6 dan of refined salt per stove, with over 1,000 dan of refined salt already produced. Based on the current production situation in various small salt regions, it is estimated that about 80,000 dan of salt can be produced by the end of this year.

During the repair of salt beds and dikes and resalting, about 30% of salt farmers in various small salt regions have organized production groups to overcome difficulties and improve production, and have formulated production covenants that include ensuring production and protecting taxes. Salt farmers in the Shatin and Bomao salt regions of Wuchuan County have also built salt storage warehouses and selected dedicated personnel to be responsible for the safekeeping of stored salt.

After resalting began, relevant departments in various regions immediately paid attention to solving the sales problem of salt in small salt regions. For example, most of the refined salt from Wuchuan is supplied to Huazhou County for agricultural use, with over 1,000 dan already sold. The 900 dan of salt produced in the Donghai small salt region of Leidong County, most of which was transferred to the Xiying sales outlet by the Zhanjiang Wholesale Office of the Salt Industry Company, with the remaining salt being reported and transported locally by local cooperatives and salt shops. Recently, in order to solve the sales problem of salt produced in the Donghai and Nansan regions, the Western Guangdong Salt Field Management Office and the Western Guangdong Aquatic Products Company are negotiating to sign a sales contract. From the fourth quarter of this year, the Western Guangdong Aquatic Products Company will be responsible for unified sales. In this way, the sales of produced and stored salt can be smooth.

Because the salt farmers in various small salt regions received assistance from the People's Government in repairing salt beds and dikes to restore production, and the People's Government solved the sales problem after the salt was produced, the salt farmers' lives have been initially improved. For example, Chen Bensen, a salt farmer in Bomao, Wuchuan, recently made two new sets of clothes after resalting, and Chen Tangxiu bought a water buffalo.

    广东西部地区被裁废的盐场开始复晒
    广东西部地区廉江县的车板、海康县的盐庭村、雷东县的庵里乡、吴川县的博茂、沙田、莫村、三合窝和南三等地曾被裁废的盐场，自今年五月下旬，经粤西盐场管理处积极领导进行复晒工作后，三个多月已先后在各小盐区成立了管产机构（盐务所），并由人民政府拨出救济款十五亿六千多万元和各种贷款帮助贫苦盐民修基修?，恢复生产。现在，有不少地区的修基修?工程已经完毕，开始复晒了。未修复的盐基盐?也正在加紧修复，不久即可产盐。雷东县的东南、庵里两乡已修好了八个?又二个结晶池，复晒后已生产食盐九百多担；其他盐基盐?也正在赶修，争取早日复晒。吴川县莫村也有九百五十多个沙?（制熟盐）恢复了生产，其他博茂、沙田及廉江县的车板等熟盐区有二百多灶已经进行复制，平均每天每灶能产熟盐六担左右，现在已产熟盐一千余担。根据目前各地小盐区的生产情况，估计到今年年底可生产食盐约八万担。
    各地小盐区在修基修?和复晒中，为了克服困难、搞好生产，有百分之三十左右的盐民组织了生产小组，并订出了以保产护税为内容的生产公约；吴川县的沙田、博茂两盐区的盐民还建搭了储盐仓地，选出专人负责保管存盐。
    复晒开始后，各地有关部门即注意解决小盐区盐斤的销路问题，如吴川熟盐大部供应化县的农业用盐，已销出一千多担；雷东县东海小盐区产盐九百多担，除大部分由盐业公司湛江批发处移运西营行销外，其余盐斤也已由当地合作社及盐店就地报运。最近为了解决东海、南三两区所产生盐斤的销路问题，粤西盐场管理处与粤西水产公司正在洽商签订包销合同，自本年第四季起由粤西水产公司统一包销。这样，产存盐斤的销路就可畅通了。
    各地小盐区的盐民因为在修基修?恢复生产时得到了人民政府的帮助，出产盐斤后，人民政府又给解决销路问题，盐民生活有了初步的改善，如吴川博茂盐民陈本森在复晒后最近就新做了两套衣服，陈棠修则买了耕牛。
