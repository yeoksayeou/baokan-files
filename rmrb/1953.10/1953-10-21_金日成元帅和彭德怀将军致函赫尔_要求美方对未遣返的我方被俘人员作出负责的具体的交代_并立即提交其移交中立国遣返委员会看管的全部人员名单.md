Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 20th: Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, sent a letter to General Hull, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, on October 20th, demanding that the U.S. side provide responsible and specific explanations for each of the 98,742 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were once held by the U.S. side but were neither repatriated nor accounted for responsibly. They also demanded that the U.S. side immediately submit to the Korean and Chinese side a list of all personnel claimed by the U.S. side to be Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and transferred to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

The full text of the letter from Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai to General Hull is as follows:

To General Hull, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command:

We have received General Clark's letter dated September 24, 1953.

On September 25, 1953, the chief member of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army side of the Military Armistice Commission notified your chief member that all your prisoners of war under our custody for direct repatriation had been repatriated to your side; all your prisoners of war not for direct repatriation had been transferred to the custody of the Indian Custodial Forces of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. We no longer have your prisoners of war in our hands.

Regarding the so-called list of your personnel allegedly captured, submitted by your side to the Military Armistice Commission on September 9, 1953, our chief member pointed out at the Military Armistice Commission on September 21, 1953, that 519 people on this list had already been directly repatriated, and 380 had already been notified to your side in the past or had been released on the front lines, or had escaped, or had died; and the remainder of this list, a part are those not directly repatriated, and most have never been captured. Our chief member also submitted to the Military Armistice Commission on October 3, 1953, the lists of the above-mentioned 519 and 380 personnel, which proves that the list submitted by your side is completely crude and fabricated, without any factual basis. Your attempt to conceal your crime of forcibly detaining our prisoners of war with such unfounded demands is doomed to failure.

Your side has publicly declared that it has detained a large number of our prisoners of war who insisted on repatriation as hostages, but has not yet fully repatriated them. Your South Korean government and its army forcibly detained more than 27,000 of our prisoners of war, and you have not yet recovered them, nor have you made any explanation. Among our prisoners of war handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody, you have placed a large number of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek agents to continue to obstruct the repatriation of these prisoners of war. At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on September 21, our chief member submitted to your side a list of 98,742 of our prisoners of war. These prisoners of war of our side have been included in your list of prisoners of war, or have been held by your side according to reliable materials, but have not been repatriated by your side, nor are they on the list of deaths and escapes submitted by your side. The total number is 76,140 more than the 22,602 prisoners of war of our side who are not directly repatriated claimed by your side to be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody. We demand that you provide responsible and specific explanations for each of these prisoners of war of our side, and we demand that you immediately submit to our side a list of all personnel claimed by your side to be prisoners of war of our side and transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody.

Kim Il-sung, Marshal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army

Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

October 20, 1953

Attached General Clark's letter:

To Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army

Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

September 25th was the final date stipulated in the Armistice Agreement for the exchange of prisoners of war on both sides who were willing to be repatriated. You have been informed that the last person of this type under the custody of the United Nations Command has been handed over to you. You also know that the last prisoner of war under the custody of the United Nations Command who did not wish to be repatriated has been handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody.

On September 9th, the chief member of the United Nations Command side of the Military Armistice Commission submitted to your chief member a list of United Nations Command personnel. We have definite evidence that these personnel were or are now in your custody. You know that this list is not merely a list of names of people missing in the war - it includes people who have been broadcast on your radio, or have been mentioned in your broadcasts, listed by you as captured by you, who wrote letters from your prisoner-of-war camps, or who were seen in your prisoner-of-war camps.

I believe that your chief member's reply to our demands submitted by your chief member at the Military Armistice Commission on September 21st is completely unacceptable.

When you signed the Armistice Agreement, you undertook a solemn obligation to directly repatriate or transfer to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission all prisoners of war in your custody at the time of the signing of the Armistice. This obligation binds you and applies to all United Nations Command personnel, regardless of where they were captured or detained.

As Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, I demand the immediate return of those United Nations Command personnel still in your hands and an honest accounting of all others who have been so clearly identified as having been in your custody.

General Clark, General of the Army, United States Army

September 24, 1953

At the Headquarters of the United Nations Command

    金日成元帅和彭德怀将军致函赫尔
    要求美方对未遣返的我方被俘人员作出负责的具体的交代
    并立即提交其移交中立国遣返委员会看管的全部人员名单
    【新华社开城二十日电】朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅与中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在十月二十日致函联合国军总司令赫尔，要求美方对曾为美方收容而美方既未予以遣返又未作负责交代的九万八千七百四十二名朝中被俘人员的每一个人，作出负责而具体的交代，并要求美方立即向朝中方面提交美方声称为朝中被俘人员而移交中立国遣返委员会看管的全部人员的名单。
    金日成元帅、彭德怀将军致赫尔将军的信全文如下：联合国军总司令赫尔将军：
    一九五三年九月二十四日克拉克将军的来信收到了。
    一九五三年九月二十五日军事停战委员会朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面首席委员，即已通知你方首席委员，前在我方收容下的直接遣返的你方被俘人员，已全部遣返你方；不直接遣返的你方被俘人员，已全部移交中立国遣返委员会印度看管部队接管。我方手中已无你方被俘人员。
    对于一九五三年九月九日你方在军事停战委员会上交来的所谓据称被俘的你方人员名单，我方首席委员已在一九五三年九月二十一日的军事停战委员会上指出：此项名单中有五百十九名已予直接遣返，三百八十名早已在过去通知你方或在前线释放、或已逃亡、或已死亡；而此项名单的其余部分，一部分是不直接遣返者，大部分从来就没有被俘过。我方首席委员并在一九五三年十月三日的军事停战委员会上，提交你方上述五百十九名与三百八十名人员的名单，它证明了你方交来的名单完全是粗制滥造而成，毫无事实根据。你方用这种毫无事实根据的要求，来掩盖你方目的在强迫扣留我方被俘人员的罪行的企图，是注定要失败的。
    你方曾公开声明扣留了大批坚持遣返的我方被俘人员作为人质，而至今未予全部遣返。你方南朝鲜政府及其军队强迫扣留了二万七千余名我方被俘人员，你方至今未予追回，亦未作出任何交代。你方在交予中立国遣返委员会看管的我方被俘人员中，更安置了大批的李承晚与蒋介石特务，阴谋继续阻挠这些我方被俘人员的遣返。九月二十一日军事停战委员会会议上，我方首席委员曾提交你方一份包括九万八千七百四十二名我方被俘人员的名单。这些我方被俘人员曾为你方所编入战俘名单，或根据确实材料曾为你方所收容，但既未被你方遣返，亦不在你方交来的死亡与逃亡的名单之中，其总数比你方声称交与中立国遣返委员会看管的二万二千六百零二名我方不直接遣返的被俘人员，多出七万六千一百四十名。我们要求你对于这些我方被俘人员的每一个人作出负责与具体的交代，我们并要求你立即向我方提交你方声称为我方被俘人员而移交中立国遣返委员会看管的全部人员的名单。
    朝鲜人民军最高司令官  朝鲜民主主义人民共和国元帅  金日成
    中国人民志愿军司令员  彭德怀
    一九五三年十月二十日附克拉克将军的来信：朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀：
    九月二十五日是停战协定规定的交送双方愿意遣返的被俘人员的期限的最后一天。已经通知你方，联合国军收容下属于这一类的最后一个人，已经送交给你们。你们也已知道，联合国军收容下的最后一名不愿遣返的战俘，已经移交中立国遣返委员会看管。
    九月九日，军事停战委员会联合国军方面的首席委员提交你方首席委员一份联合国军人员的名单。我们有肯定的证据，这些人员过去曾经是或者现在是在你们的收容之下。你们知道这份名单并不仅仅是战争中失踪人员的名字，——它包括在你们的无线电中作过广播的人，或在你们的广播中曾被提到过的人，被你们列为你们俘获的人，自你们的战俘营中写出信来或在你们的战俘营中被看到过的人。
    我认为九月二十一日军事停战委员会你方首席委员所提出的你们对我们的要求的答复是完全不能接受的。
    当你们签署了停战协定时，你们就承担了庄严的义务：将停战签字时你们所收容的全部被俘人员直接遣返或移交中立国遣返委员会看管。这一义务约束着你们，并适用于所有联合国军人员无论在何地被俘或拘留于何地。
    作为联合国军总司令，我要求立即送还那些尚在你们手中的联合国军人员，并对已经如此明确认出曾在你们收容之下的所有其他的人作诚实的交代。
    总司令
    美国陆军上将  克拉克
    一九五三年九月二十四日
    于联合国军总部
