　　"Production Internship Makes Us Love Our Major Even More"

　　Editor's Note: Recently, many students from various colleges and universities have written to reflect on their experiences and practical gains during their summer internships this year. Through production internships, they further realized that all aspects of the country's economic construction are important and mutually supportive. For example, to develop industry, it is necessary to train thousands of geological talents to explore and discover underground resources, and a large number of mining talents are needed to extract these resources. Also, for basic construction and urban construction, "water supply and drainage" work is indispensable. Many students wrote that through production internships, they are determined to overcome various individualistic ideas and love their major even more. They clearly see the position and beautiful prospects of their future professional tasks in the entire national construction. Our country is systematically training construction talents to meet the needs of national industrialization. Now, new students admitted from various places are reporting to school one after another. In order to help students correctly understand the importance of various construction undertakings in the motherland, we have selected four letters for publication below.

　　Improve Political Awareness and Professional Knowledge Prepare to Dedicate Oneself to the Motherland's Hydropower Industry

　　Wang Shijin, a student majoring in water energy utilization at Tsinghua University, wrote: In mid-August, more than sixty students in the second grade of our hydropower equipment major (now renamed water energy utilization) went to a hydropower plant in Northeast China for their first production internship. In the past, students had a vague understanding of what they would be doing after graduation. Some students felt that there was an electrical engineering department in the electrical field, and hydraulic engineering in structures; but we "hovered between the hydraulic engineering and electrical engineering departments." Some students thought that studying this major would definitely mean working in beautiful scenic spots and being able to travel and enjoy the scenery in the future. Although some students realized that our major is very important in the country's construction, they were not very clear about it. During this internship, we saw many benchmark points used to measure dam deformation on the long dam; we saw complex oil pressure systems and lubrication systems; we saw the true face of a hydropower plant... We deeply felt that what we had learned in the past was too little, and we must work harder in the future. Through this internship, we truly understood that power plants are the heart of industry, which will drive factories and construction sites to produce, turn darkness into light, and make rooms warm and pleasant; hydropower plant reservoir projects can also control and regulate hundreds of millions of cubic meters of water, so that the downstream banks of rivers can be protected from floods during the flood season, and irrigation can be obtained during water shortages, ensuring bumper harvests and the happiness of the people. Our great motherland has areas with abundant water energy, and power stations will soon be built, becoming an important part of the prime mover needed for the motherland's transition to socialism. We are proud to dedicate ourselves to this great cause.

　　This production internship also gave us a good political education. At the beginning of liberation, this hydropower plant was a dilapidated mess that had been subjected to explosions, fires, and water damage. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the workers worked selflessly, so that the hydropower plant quickly recovered and sent light to the people. This hydropower plant originally had two or three accidents a month, but now it has been more than a year without any accidents and no power outage for a second. In the eyes of some people, the work of the workers is very ordinary. For example, the machines are always humming, the workers in the power distribution room are staring at the instruments that always do not change much, and the workers by the speed governor are calculating how many revolutions the machine has made... It is these "ordinary" and "rigid" work that create huge wealth for the country. This fact gave me a profound education, making me correctly realize that on all fronts of building the motherland, any work is important and meaningful. I must learn from the noble qualities of the workers, constantly improve my political awareness and professional knowledge, and do more work for the motherland's hydropower industry in the future. The People Require Us to Study Hard

　　To Discover More Mineral Deposits for the Motherland in the Future

　　Liu Qinglin, a student of the Department of Geology of Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, wrote: Our internship life in the Daye mining area is an unforgettable event. Songs flew in the fields and valleys. The old professors excitedly walked and climbed mountains like young students, and constantly cared about the students' lives and explained all the difficulties encountered in the field internship. In the Jianshan area, we truly recognized the filling phenomenon, metasomatic phenomenon, and faults of marble, etc. The students' learning enthusiasm was very high. Some students even climbed barefoot up dozens of meters high cliffs and cliffs to see the relationship between the ore body and the surrounding rock, find symbiotic minerals, and find surrounding rock alteration phenomena to prove what type of deposit this ore belongs to. Some students discovered malachite, azurite, and vivianite together on the mountainside with an inclination of more than 70 degrees. Some students discovered chloritization, epidotization, and other surrounding rock alteration phenomena in diorite. The students nervously hammered rocks and minerals, measured the rock's strike and dip angle, and made notes or cross-sectional sketches. We used theory to make practical analysis of specific things and truly understood the textbook theory.

　　During the internship, we received help from comrades of the local exploration team. Engineers and technicians gave us reports on internship content and demonstrations on the operation methods of prospecting instruments. Technical workers also enthusiastically explained the operation methods of the tools to us, greatly expanding our field of knowledge. The people also deeply cared about us, often asking us: "Is there copper ore here?" "When will it be mined?" Teachers and students deeply realized that our teaching today is to prepare for creating happiness for the people of the motherland tomorrow. Facing the powerful, vast, and rich motherland, we feel that our future is bright and we are proud of our beautiful and colorful youth.

　　Determined to Engage in "Water Supply and Drainage" Work

　　To Create a Better Life for the People

　　Qiu Chou, a student at Tsinghua University, wrote: I am studying "water supply and drainage." The application of hydraulics encountered in this internship is much more vivid than in textbooks. For example, when we learned about the pressure pipes on both sides of the Venturi tube, we only recognized that there was a certain relationship between the pressure difference and the flow rate, but we did not know any other methods besides applying the conversion formula of pressure difference and flow rate to calculate the flow rate. This time we learned a lot of knowledge, such as combining the Venturi principle, Pascal's principle, and the lever principle to form a clever automatic filtration rate regulator; and flexibly applying the Venturi principle to chlorine gas metering chlorinators, etc. These things enriched our theory, enriched our imagination, and made us understand how to flexibly apply theory to practice and turn it into something full of life.

　　Our understanding of the close relationship between "electrical industry," "thermal engineering," and "water supply and drainage" was always unclear before. Through this internship, we saw that "thermal engines" and "electric motors" are widely used in pumping rooms and booster stations, the application of various forms of electric motors and various ingenious electric automatic controllers, especially the ingenious use of steam condensers in steam-powered Wanxin water pumps, which saves a lot of "coal consumption." This made us deeply realize the importance of "electricity" in production.

　　Through this practical education, we deepened our love for our major. Everyone criticized the past erroneous view that sewers were "digging smelly ditches and burying pipes," as Li Jing wrote in his diary: "Our cause will transform those smelly ditches that people cover their noses and pass by into tree-lined avenues full of flowers and plants, and transform those sewage pools that breed maggots and flies into beautiful parks. Isn't this a meaningful struggle for the happy life of the working people!"

　　For the Motherland's Forestry Cause

　　Dedicate Our Youth and Strength

　　Chen Ying from Beijing Forestry College wrote: At the end of July, the production internship team organized by more than 130 people from Beijing Forestry College began to enter the Guancen Mountain forest area in Ningwu County, Shanxi Province. The saying "Wear cotton in the morning, gauze at noon, and eat watermelon by the stove" accurately illustrates the characteristics of the local climate. However, for a month, whether it was sunny or rainy, the students were full of energy, carrying backpacks, carrying surveying poles, measuring ropes, and other instruments, climbing high into the forest, looking at the composition of the forest, the forest appearance, exploring the changes in rocks, studying the structure of the soil and the distribution of ground cover plants. We developed deep feelings for stones, soil, grasses, and every tree. The process of "gray soil formation," "the relationship between the soil after weathering of various rocks and the forest," and "how sand and gravel cones are formed," etc., through observation of things in practical work, we not only understood the principles, but also could observe and analyze the reasons for its occurrence and the impact it had. The students felt very excited and deeply realized the importance of linking theory with practice. This internship consolidated the theoretical knowledge we have learned and established our love for the major. We knew the relationship between building farmland shelterbelts and ensuring farmland water conservancy and improving people's lives, and that the forestry cause is an important part of national construction. Therefore, we corrected the wrong idea of "learning forestry is not as good as learning engineering" and established the determination to devote ourselves to forestry for life, and we are willing to contribute our youth and strength to the forestry cause.

### “生产实习使我们更加热爱所学的专业”

专栏：读者来信摘要

    “生产实习使我们更加热爱所学的专业”
    编者按：最近各地高等学校不少学生来信反映在今年暑期实习中的生活情况和实际收获。经过生产实习，他们进一步体会到国家经济建设的各个方面都是重要的而且是相互配合的。譬如要发展工业，就需要培养成千上万的地质人材去勘探和发现地下资源，就需要大量的采矿人材去开采这些资源；又如要进行基本建设和城市建设，“给水下水”的工作也是不可缺少的。许多同学来信表示，经过生产实习，使他们决心克服各种个人主义的想法，更加热爱所学的专业。他们清醒地看到将来所负担的专业任务，在整个国家建设中的地位及其美丽远景。我们的国家正有计划地培养建设人材，以适应国家工业化的需要。现在，各地录取的新生正纷纷报到入学。为了帮助同学们正确地认识祖国各种建设事业的重要性，我们选摘来信四件发表在下面。
    提高政治觉悟和业务知识  准备献身祖国水力发电事业
    清华大学水能利用专业学生汪诗金来信：八月中旬，我们水力动力装置专业（现改为水能利用）二年级的六十几个同学，到东北某水力发电厂进行了第一次生产实习。过去，同学们对自己毕业后到底是干啥的认识很模糊。有的同学觉得在电的方面有电机系，在结构上有水工；而我们却“徘徊在水利与电机两系之间”。有的同学认为学习这门专业将来一定是到美丽风景区工作，可以游山玩水。有的同学虽然认识到我们所学的专业在祖国建设中是很重要的，但还不是很明确的。在这次实习中，我们在长长的堤坝上，看到了作为测量坝身变形用的许多基准点；看到了复杂的油压系统，润滑系统；看到了一个水电厂的真实面目……。我们深深感觉到过去所学的东西太少，今后必须加倍努力学习。经过这次实习，我们切实了解了发电厂是工业的心脏，这里将带动工厂和工地进行生产，使黑夜变成光明，让房间温暖和愉快；水力发电厂的水库工程又能控制和调节几亿立方公尺的水量，使河流下游两岸在汛期免受水灾威胁，在缺水时期能得到灌溉，保证庄稼丰收和人民的幸福生活。我们伟大的祖国蕴蓄着丰富水能的地带，不久都要建立起发电站，成为祖国过渡到社会主义所需原动力的重要的一部分。我们为将要献身于这一伟大事业而感到骄傲。
    这次生产实习也给了我们一个很好的政治教育。刚解放的时候，这所水力发电厂是一个受过爆炸、火烧和水冲的破烂摊儿。解放后，工人同志们在党和人民政府的正确领导下忘我地工作，使这个水力发电厂很快恢复，给人民送出了光明。这所水力发电厂原先每月有二、三次事故，现在已有一年多没出任何事故，没有停电一秒钟。在有些人看来，工人们的工作都是很平凡的。比如机器老是那么轰轰地转动，配电室的工人眼睛睁得鼓鼓地瞅着那几块总是没有什么大变化的仪表，调速器边的工人计算着机器到底转了多少转，……。就是这些“平凡”、“呆板”的工作，为国家创造出了巨大的财富。这件事实，给了我深刻的教育，使我正确地认识到在建设祖国的各种战线上，任何工作都是重要的，有意义的。我一定要学习工人同志们这种高贵的品质，不断地提高自己的政治觉悟和业务知识，将来为祖国的水力发电事业做更多的工作。人民要求我们努力学习
    将来为祖国发现更多的矿藏
    中南矿冶学院地质系刘庆林来信：我们在大冶矿区的实习生活，是一件终身难忘的事情。歌声飞扬在原野和山谷，年老的教授们兴冲冲地和青年同学一样走路爬山，还不断关心同学们的生活和讲解野外实习中所遇到的一切疑难。在尖山一带我们真正认识了地质的充填现象、交代现象和大理岩的断层等。同学们的学习情绪非常高涨。有的同学甚至赤了脚爬上几十公尺高的峭壁悬崖，去看矿体与围岩关系，找共生矿物，找围岩蚀变现象，以证明这矿属于何种类型的矿床。有的同学在倾斜七十多度的山半腰发现了孔雀石、蓝铜矿和磷铁矿共生在一起。有的同学在闪长岩中发现了绿泥石化、绿帘石化等围岩蚀变现象。同学们紧张地用铁锤敲打着岩石、矿物，测量岩石走向和倾角，作笔记或剖面素描图。我们根据理论来对具体事物作实际的分析，切实了解了课本理论。
    在实习中，我们得到当地勘探队同志的帮助，工程师、技术员向我们作了有关实习内容的报告和探矿仪器操作方法的表演，技术工人同志也热情地给我们讲解工具的操作方法，大大地扩大了我们的知识领域。人民群众也在深深地关心我们，经常地问我们：“这里有铜矿吗？”“什么时候来开？”师生们都深刻地体会到：我们今天的教学，就是在准备明天为祖国人民创造幸福。面对着强大辽阔富饶的祖国，我们感到自己前程远大，为我们美丽多采的青春而骄傲。
    决心从事“给水下水”工作
    为人民创造更美好的生活
    清华大学学生仇讐来信：我是学“给水下水”专业的。这次在实习中所遇到的水力的应用，比书本上要生动得多。例如我们学冯透里管两侧压管时，只认识到压差与流量是有一定关系的，可是除了套用压差与流量的换算公式去计算流量外，就不知道还有别的什么办法。这次我们学到许多知识，如把冯透里原理、巴斯加原理与杠杆的原理结合起来，构成一种巧妙的自动滤率调节器；又如以冯透里原理灵活地应用于氯气的计量量氯计等。这些东西充实了我们的理论，丰富了我们的想像力，使我们懂得了怎样把理论灵活地运用到实际中去，而变成富有生命的东西。
    我们对“电工业”、“热工学”和“给水下水”的密切关系的认识，以前始终不大明确。通过这次实习，我们看到了“热机”与“电机”被大量地应用到抽水房与加压站，各种形式的电动马达与各种巧妙的电动自动控制器的应用，特别是汽动式万心水泵中蒸汽凝结器的巧妙运用，节省了大量“煤耗”。这使我们深刻地认识到“电”在生产中的重要性。
    通过这种实际的教育，我们加深了对所学专业的热爱。大家都批判了过去那种认为上下水道是“挖挖臭沟、埋埋管子”的错误看法，如李晶同学在他的日记中写道：“我们的事业，将使那些人们掩鼻而过的臭沟改变成为花草馥郁的林荫大道，将使那些孳生着蛆蝇的污水池改变成为美丽的公园。难道这不是为劳动人民幸福生活而作的有意义的斗争么！”
    为祖国的森林事业
    献出自己的青春和力量
    北京林学院陈滢来信：七月底，我们北京林学院一百三十多人组织的生产实习大队开始进入山西省宁武县管涔山林区。“早穿棉，午穿纱，抱着火炉吃西瓜”这句谚语正说明了当地气候的特点。但是，一月来不管是天晴下雨，同学们都是精神饱满地背上背包，拿着标竿、测绳等仪器，登高入林，寻视着森林的组成、林相，探讨着岩石的变化，研究着土壤的构造和地被物分布的情况。我们对石头、泥土、草类以及每一棵树木，都发生了深厚的感情。“灰壤土形成的过程”，“各种岩石风化后的土壤对森林的关系”，“沙砾圆锥是怎样形成的”等等问题，通过实际工作中对事物的观察，我们不仅懂得了道理，而且能观察和分析它产生的原因，发生的影响。同学们感到很兴奋，也深深体会到了理论联系实际的重要。这次实习，巩固了我们已学过的理论知识，并且使我们树立了对专业的热爱，知道了营造农田防护林对保障农田水利、改善人民生活的关系，而森林事业正是国家建设中重要的一部分。因此纠正了“学林不如学工好”的错误想法，建立了终身为林业奋斗的决心，愿意在森林事业中贡献自己的青春和力量。
