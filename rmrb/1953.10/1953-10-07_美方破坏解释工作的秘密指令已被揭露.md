Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 6th: Qian Shunkun, a captured Chinese People's Volunteer soldier who was repatriated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) on the 4th, handed over five secret instructions that fell into his hands to the NNRC. These five instructions were from US CIE (Central Intelligence Establishment) special agents to the special agents in the POW camp.

Qian Shunkun was originally held in a camp near the "hospital" in the neutral POW camp. On September 28th, a special agent surnamed Zhang, posing as a "prisoner of war," entered his camp. Because this person was illiterate, he asked Qian Shunkun to read five secret instructions from the US special agents for him, and told him that these were given to Ge Yongfei, the head of the secret liaison station who was pretending to be sick in the "hospital," by a CIE special agent surnamed Ma (Qian Shunkun knew that this person had come to Jeju Island POW camp from Taiwan in November 1952 to be a teacher at the CIE "school") who was acting as an interpreter for the US side in the "hospital". Ge Yongfei used to be the commander of the 3rd POW camp on Jeju Island. This person surnamed Zhang was sent out of the "hospital" by him to deliver the instructions, but he was imprisoned in this camp by the Indian troops for violating hospital rules. After hearing this, Qian Shunkun made an excuse to pack the letters separately for him, hid these five instructions, and replaced them with five fake instructions to return to him. These five fake instructions were later handed over to the American driver and ROK (Republic of Korea) assistant who came with the garbage truck every day to be forwarded to various camps.

On October 3rd, after Qian Shunkun escaped from the camp, he handed over two of the instructions to an Indian captain. When the NNRC questioned him, he handed over the remaining three to the Indian chairman, and handed over the other two copies he had copied to an Indian major.

Qian Shunkun said that, as far as he could remember, the contents of these secret instructions included the following points: (1) Control the prisoners of war so that they do not go outside the barbed wire to listen to explanations; (2) Demand that India allow so-called "pastors" to enter the camp; (3) Coerce prisoners of war to write to Chiang Kai-shek and Eisenhower to express their opposition to the explanation work; (4) The "hospital" is the general liaison station for special agents, and various camps must send people there regularly to receive instructions; (5) Frequently demand that India improve food, conduct physical examinations, etc.; (6) Find all excuses to hold demonstrations. The instructions, such as the request to allow special agents disguised as "pastors" to enter the camp, have been publicly put forward by the US side. This clearly proves that the US side is eager to send more special agents into the camp to carry out more intense sabotage activities.

### 美方破坏解释工作的秘密指令已被揭露

    美方破坏解释工作的秘密指令已被揭露
    【新华社开城六日电】四日由中立国遣返归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员钱顺坤，将落在他手中的美方破坏解释工作和制造暴乱的五份秘密指令，交给了中立国遣返委员会。这五份指令是美国CIE特务给战俘营场内的特务分子的。
    钱顺坤原被看管在中立国战俘营“医院”附近的营场里。九月二十八日，一个冒充“战俘”的姓张的特务进入他那个营场。这个人因为不识字，拿五份美方特务的秘密指令要钱顺坤替他看，并告诉他，这是在“医院”里充当美方翻译的一个姓马的CIE特务（钱顺坤知道这个人于一九五二年十一月自台湾到济州岛战俘营当CIE“学校”教员）交给装病住在“医院”中的秘密联络站负责人葛永飞的。葛永飞曾任济州岛第三战俘营联队长，这个姓张的是他派出院来传递，但姓张的特务因不守医院规则被印度部队关进了这个营地。钱顺坤听后托辞替他分别装信封，把这五份指令藏了起来，另换了五张假指令交还给他。这五份假指令以后便交给了每天开垃圾车来的美国司机和李伪军助手转送到各营场。
    十月三日，钱顺坤逃出营场以后，就曾把其中两份指令交给了一个印度大尉。在中立国遣返委员会询问他时，他又把其余的三份交给了印度主席，把他自己抄下的另外两份交给了一个印度少校。
    钱顺坤说，据他记得，这些秘密指令的内容有这样几点：（一）控制战俘不出铁丝网听解释；（二）要求印度允许所谓“牧师”进入营场；（三）胁迫战俘上书蒋介石和艾森豪威尔，表示反对解释工作；（四）“医院”是特务总联络站，各营场要经常派人去领受指令；（五）频繁地要求印度改善伙食、检查体格等；（六）寻找一切藉口，举行示威游行。指令中所说的如要求允许披着“牧师”外衣的特务进入营场，已由美方公开提出，这清楚地证明，美方急于要派遣更多的特务分子进入营场，进行更激烈的破坏活动。
