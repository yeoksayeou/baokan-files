    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 3rd. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission issued the following statement on the 2nd regarding the Commission's work situation:
    "In view of the various rumors circulating regarding the activities of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, this Commission wishes to clarify the situation. The paramount objective of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's current work is to give prisoners of war a fair opportunity to freely express their desire or unwillingness to be repatriated.
    The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission encountered many problems from the very beginning. The first issue this Commission had to resolve was whether to allow observer representatives from both sides to be present when the Commission received prisoners of war.
    The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Headquarters firmly believed that the presence of observer representatives was necessary, and after careful consideration, this Commission invited observer representatives from both sides to attend.
    The United Nations Command later objected to the presence of observer representatives from both sides during the prisoner of war reception process. Their attitude was that the prisoner of war takeover work was not the responsibility of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, but only the responsibility of the Indian Custodial Forces.
    This argument is unacceptable because, according to its mandate, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is responsible for the custody of prisoners of war through its agency - the Indian Custodial Forces.
    Prisoners of war were undoubtedly organized into groups during the reception process, and this form of organization remains in the current prisoner of war camps. All the leaders among the prisoners of war before being received by the Indian forces continue to exert influence over the prisoners of war, and the prisoners of war are subjected to great pressure, sometimes through acts of violence. This is the problem this Commission faces today.
    The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has now completed the first phase of its work and has entered the second phase of explaining and visiting the prisoners of war. Whether the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission can complete its task depends on whether this work can be carried out smoothly.
    This Commission has finally adopted detailed rules for conducting explanations and visits, and has given the full text of these rules to both Commands.
    Similarly, leaflets approved by this Commission, notifying prisoners of war of their rights and obligations under the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's mandate, have been translated into Chinese and Korean and have been distributed and read to the prisoners of war. This Commission will take similar steps within a day or two regarding the rules for explaining to and visiting the prisoners of war.
    It must be mentioned again: due to the failure to finalize the detailed procedures for explanation and visits in a timely manner, the Commission had to request both Commands to postpone the start date of explanation and visits by five days, thereby extending the explanation period by five days as well.
    Both Commands agreed to the postponement. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Headquarters agreed to postpone the explanation period by five days accordingly, but the United Nations Command did not agree.
    The Commission has asked both Commands to reconsider this issue. At the same time, both sides have made some suggestions regarding the facilities prepared for the explanation representatives and the locations for conducting explanations and visits.
    Regarding the prisoners of war previously detained by them, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Headquarters accepted the suggestions of the United Nations Command. The United Nations Command, after consultation with the Indian Custodial Forces, built facilities in certain locations.
    However, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Headquarters do not consider these facilities and locations to be suitable. The United Nations Command is still considering this issue.
    The Commission will make its final decision on these suggestions as quickly as possible and within the shortest possible time, and will begin the second phase of its work, namely conducting explanations and visits."

### 中立国遣返委员会发表关于工作情况的声明

    中立国遣返委员会发表关于工作情况的声明
    【新华社开城三日电】中立国遣返委员会在二日发表关于该委员会工作情况的声明如下：
    “鉴于目前流传着各种关于中立国遣返委员会的活动的传说，本委员会希望把情况澄清一下。中立国遣返委员会目前工作的最高目的是使战俘有一个公平机会，表示自己愿意或不愿意接受遣返的自由意愿。
    中立国遣返委员会从一开始就遇到了不少问题。本委员会要解决的第一个问题即是否允许双方的观察代表在委员会接收战俘工作进行时列席的问题。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部坚决认为观察代表的在场是必须的，本委员会在经过慎重考虑后邀请了双方观察代表出席。
    联合国军司令部后来对双方观察代表在战俘接收工作进行时列席一事提出反对。他们的态度是：战俘接管工作并不是中立国遣返委员会的工作，而只是印度看管部队的工作。
    这种论点是不能接受的，因为，按照职权范围，是中立国遣返委员会通过它的机构——印度看管部队——负责战俘的看管工作的。
    战俘在接收工作进行时无疑已分组组织好了，这种组织形式在现在的战俘营中仍旧保留着。在被印度部队接收以前战俘中间所有的领导分子现在仍继续对战俘行施影响，战俘遭受着很大的压力，有时这种压力是暴力行为。这便是本委员会今天面临的问题。
    中立国遣返委员会现已完成它的第一阶段的工作，已进入对战俘进行解释和访问的第二阶段的工作。中立国遣返委员会能否完成任务，要看这项工作能否顺利执行而定。
    本委员会已最后采纳了关于进行解释和访问的细则，并已把这个细则的全文交给双方司令部。
    同样，经本委员会批准的传单，其中通知战俘他们根据中立国遣返委员会的职权范围应有的权利和义务，已经译为中文和朝鲜文，并已向战俘散发和宣读，本委员会将在一两天之内，就关于对战俘进行解释和访问的规则，采取类似的步骤。
    必须重新提到：由于未能按时最后决定关于解释和访问的程序的细则，委员会不得不向双方司令部提出把开始进行解释和访问的日期推延五天的要求，从而解释期限也得向后推延五天。
    双方司令部都同意了延期。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部同意相应地把解释期限推后五天，但是联军司令部则不同意。
    委员会已要求双方司令部再考虑这个问题。同时，双方都就为解释代表准备的设施及进行解释和访问地点提出了一些建议。
    关于以前为它们所拘留的战俘，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部接受了联军司令部的建议。联军司令部与印度看管部队磋商后，在某些地点修建了设施。
    但是，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部不认为这些设施和地点是合适的。这个问题，联军司令部仍在考虑中。
    在尽可能快并在办得到的最短期间内，委员会将就这些建议作出它的最后的决定，并着手进行第二阶段的工作，即进行解释和访问。”
