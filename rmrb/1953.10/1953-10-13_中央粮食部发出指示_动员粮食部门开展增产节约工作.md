    Central Ministry of Food Issues Instructions
    Mobilize Grain Departments to Carry Out Production Increase and Conservation Work

    [Report from this newspaper] The Central People's Government Ministry of Food issued instructions to the major regions and provincial (municipal) food departments on October 7, requiring food departments at all levels across the country to take prompt action and carry out production increase and conservation work.

    The instructions emphasized that grain procurement is the most important task of the food departments. Food departments in all regions should promptly and firmly grasp the autumn grain procurement work. On the basis of fulfilling and overfulfilling the grain procurement plan, attention should be paid to saving expenses, correctly implementing price policies, and striving to complete the task of turning over profits to the state.

    The instructions stated: In terms of commodity circulation and other expenses, food departments in various regions should pay attention to careful budgeting, especially to grasping the direction of grain circulation and the laws of supply and demand, correctly formulating grain allocation plans, implementing reasonable transportation, shortening transport ton-kilometers, overcoming waste phenomena such as opposite-direction transportation and roundabout transportation, and reducing transportation costs. Savings should also be sought in areas such as basic construction investment and administrative expenses. At the same time, various grain price differences should be well managed, and precise calculations should be made according to the principles of economic accounting to reduce state compensation and accumulate construction funds for the country.

    The instructions also require food departments at all levels to pay attention to the issue of grain conservation. The first priority is to reduce the precision of grain processing and strive to increase the rice yield of paddy rice and the flour yield of wheat. The instructions pointed out that according to the current situation of paddy rice and wheat processing, if the finished product rate is increased by only two or three jin per hundred jin of grain, the national output of rice and flour will increase by tens of billions of jin each year.

    Also reported: The Central People's Government Ministry of Food convened a meeting of all cadres on September 19 to deploy production increase and conservation work.

    Zhang Naiqi, Minister of the Central People's Government Ministry of Food, delivered a report at the meeting. After explaining the significance of increasing production and practicing economy, he pointed out: The production increase and conservation work of the grain department should first focus on the two central links of grain management and grain transfer. In terms of procurement, grain prices should be set reasonably, and the state should control a large amount of grain to stabilize prices and cooperate with national construction. In terms of sales, various price differences should be reasonably and timely controlled, striving to combine political tasks and economic accounting to avoid unnecessary losses. At the same time, efforts should be made to accumulate funds for the country by reducing expenses, especially by reducing transfer costs. A large part of the grain controlled by the state needs to be transferred, and transportation costs account for the largest proportion of grain commodity circulation costs. The grain department must conduct in-depth investigation and research, grasp the situation of production and sales, warehouse capacity, etc., and strive to balance grain distribution and accurately plan transfers to avoid waste phenomena such as roundabout transportation and reverse flow. In addition, in terms of grain storage, processing, and basic construction, the suggestions of Soviet experts should be implemented in a planned, step-by-step, and active manner to reduce grain loss rates, increase grain processing yield rates, and save building materials. Zhang Naiqi also made arrangements on how the Central People's Government Ministry of Food organs should practice strict economy internally. On the same day, the General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of China of the Ministry of Food also convened a general meeting of all party members to deploy production increase and conservation work.

    中央粮食部发出指示
    动员粮食部门开展增产节约工作
    【本报讯】中央人民政府粮食部于十月七日向全国各大区、省（市）粮食部门发出指示，要求全国各级粮食部门迅速行动起来，开展增产节约工作。
    指示着重指出：收购粮食是粮食部门头等重要任务。全国各地粮食部门应及时抓紧秋粮收购工作，在完成和超额完成粮食收购计划的基础上，注意节约费用，正确执行价格政策，争取完成上缴任务。
    指示中称：在商品流转等项费用方面，各地粮食部门应注意精打细算，特别是要掌握粮食流转方向及供求法则，正确制订粮食调拨计划，实行合理运输，缩短运输吨公里，克服相向运输、迂回运输等方面的浪费现象，减少运费开支。在基本建设投资和行政开支等方面，也应力求节约。同时，应掌握好各种粮食差价，根据经济核算的原则精密计算，以减少国家的赔累，为国家积累建设资金。
    指示并要求各级粮食部门注意粮食节约的问题。首先要降低粮食加工精度，争取提高稻谷出米率和小麦出粉率。指示中指出，按照目前稻谷、小麦加工的情况，每百斤粮只要提高两三斤成品率，全国每年多出产的大米、面粉将达十数亿斤。
    又讯：中央人民政府粮食部已在九月十九日召开了全体干部大会，布置增产节约工作。
    中央人民政府粮食部部长章乃器在会上作报告。他在说明了增产节约的意义后指出：粮食部门的增产节约工作，首先要抓住粮食经营和粮食调运两个中心环节。在收购方面，粮食价格要拟定得合理，国家要掌握大量粮食，用以稳定物价，配合国家建设事业；在销售方面，应合理地、适时地掌握各种差价，力求政治任务和经济核算结合起来，避免不必要的赔本。同时，还应从减少费用入手，为国家积累资金，特别是要减低调运费用。国家所掌握的粮食，很大一部分需要调运，在粮食商品流通费中，运费所占比重最大。粮食部门必须深入进行调查研究，掌握产销、仓库容量等情况，力求使粮食摆布平衡、调运计划准确，避免迂回运输和倒流等浪费现象。此外，在粮食保管、加工和基本建设方面，要有计划、有步骤而又积极地实行苏联专家的建议，以减少粮食损耗率，提高粮食加工成品率，节省建筑材料。关于中央人民政府粮食部机关内部如何厉行节约，章乃器也作了布置。同一天，中共粮食部总支委员会也召开全体党员大会，布置了增产节约工作。
