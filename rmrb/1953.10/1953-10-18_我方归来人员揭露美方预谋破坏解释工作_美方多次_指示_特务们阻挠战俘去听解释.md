Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th: The current actions of US special agents to obstruct prisoners of war from listening to explanations are entirely part of a US pre-arranged plot to sabotage the explanation work. The inside facts revealed by Li Yingxian, a Korean People's Army prisoner of war repatriated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 14th, fully prove this point.

Li Yingxian served as the "Battalion Commander" of Camp 48 before repatriation. This camp was one of the two camps where our explanation representatives originally planned to conduct explanations on the 16th, but the explanation work could not be carried out on the 16th because special agents prevented prisoners of war from leaving the camp. Based on his understanding of the situation in the camp, Li Yingxian pointed out: "The reason why special agents prevent prisoners of war from leaving the camp to listen to explanations is because the special agents are afraid that the prisoners of war will request repatriation after listening to the explanations."

Li Yingxian said that after entering the camp guarded by Indian troops, he saw more than 50 "instructions" from Jiang Jinglie, a special agent in Camp 48 and leader of the "Anti-Communist Youth Corps." These "instructions" were all signed by Wen Chonghao, the special agent leader in charge of the camp and the general head of the "Anti-Communist Youth Corps" of the Nonsan prisoner of war camp. All these "instructions" were to strengthen control over prisoners of war, sabotage explanation work, and oppose the Indian guard troops.

Li Yingxian remembers the content of the "instructions" included: 1. When the explanation work begins, prisoners of war must not be allowed to listen to the explanations. In the future, when the Indians come to take them, no one is allowed to go out. Do not accept any clauses of the explanation work, and do not announce these clauses to the prisoners of war. (Issued on September 15th). 2. When the explanation work begins, a "demonstration" must be held, otherwise it will affect the prisoners of war. (Issued in late September). 3. The "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work" must not be allowed to be known to prisoners of war. Break the loudspeakers so that prisoners of war cannot hear the explanations. (Issued in early October). 4. After the explanation work begins, food may not be supplied due to the need to conduct parades and demonstrations. Now it is necessary to save food and save half of the lunch. (Issued in early October). 5. Resist the Indian troops and demand that the Indian troops withdraw from Korea. (Issued in early October). 6. The explanation work is about to begin, and we must do everything possible to sabotage the explanation work. The specific methods can be divided into three steps: First, resolutely refuse to listen to the explanation; Second, those with "consolidated" thinking should go first and delay the explanation representatives; Third, form a group of five people, one or two of whom are responsible. If someone returns to the country, the person in charge will be punished. (Issued on October 9th). 7. If the Indian troops use force to force them to listen to the explanation, they must "duel" with the Indian troops and seize the weapons of the Indian troops. "We have a large number of people, and the Indian soldiers are only 5,000. Moreover, we have the United Nations forces and the Republic of Korea forces behind us, so there is no need to worry at all." (Issued in early October).

Li Yingxian also remembers that there were instructions on intensifying control over prisoners of war and preventing them from expressing their willingness to be repatriated: 1. After entering the Indian camp, the "impure elements" in the major battalions have gradually increased, and surveillance must be strengthened; and they must be dealt with. If anyone is seen requesting repatriation, they should be killed on the spot. (Issued in late September). 2. "The three or four red elements in the hospital have already been 'dealt with.' You must do the same here." (Issued in early October). 3. Do not send patients from the major battalions to the hospital anymore, because many people have escaped from the hospital. When seriously ill patients are sent to the hospital, they must be reviewed by the special agent team, and more than two special agent team members must follow them. A gap from the hospital to the Indian troop camp should be guarded by special agent team members to prevent patients from escaping during "medication change." (Issued in early October). 4. The first "impure element" was not dealt with thoroughly. Further "treatment" must be carried out, and all "impure elements" must be "resolutely dealt with!" (Issued in early October).

Li Yingxian said: These "instructions" were transmitted to the various camps by various methods. Before late September, the special agents used the opportunity for prisoners of war to travel between the various camps to transmit these "instructions." After the Indian guard troops prohibited mutual travel between the various camps, the special agents tied the "instructions" to stones and threw them from one camp to another. After early October, the special agents even used the "prisoner of war representatives" meetings allowed by the Indian guard troops to transmit instructions and secret messages. Li Yingxian also said: One night at the end of September, Wen Chonghao specially ran from Camp 49 to Camp 48 and excitedly told him: "Our general command post is in the 'hospital,' and all instructions can be obtained from there; through the 'nurses' in the hospital, we can already contact President Lee and the Americans." Wen Chonghao's words revealed that the "instructions" he signed to sabotage the explanation work were received from the US-Lee gang.

    我方归来人员揭露美方预谋破坏解释工作
    美方多次“指示”特务们阻挠战俘去听解释
    【新华社开城十七日电】目前美方特务阻挠战俘听取解释的行动，完全是美方事先布置好的破坏解释工作阴谋的一部分。十四日由中立国遣返委员会遣送归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员李应善揭发的内幕事实，充分地证明了这一点。
    李应善遣返之前，在四十八号营场担任“大队长”，这个营场就是我方解释代表原定在十六日进行解释的两个营场之一，但因为特务阻止战俘离开营场，解释工作在十六日未能进行。李应善根据他对营场中情况的了解，指出：“特务们阻止战俘出营场来听解释，就是因为特务们害怕战俘听了解释，会要求遣返。”
    李应善说，他在进入印度部队看管的营场以后，曾从四十八号营场的特务分子、“反共青年团”组长姜京烈那里看到过五十多份“指示”。这些“指示”都是由看管营内的特务头子、原论山战俘营“反共青年团”总团长文重浩签发的。所有这些“指示”是要加强对战俘的控制，破坏解释工作，反对印度看管部队。
    李应善记得“指示”的内容有：一、在解释工作开始时，一定不能让战俘听取解释。将来印度人来带时，谁也不准出去。不接受解释工作的任何条文，也不准对战俘宣布这些条文。（九月十五日发）。二、解释工作开始时要举行“示威”，不然就会对战俘发生影响。（九月下旬发）。三、“解释和访问工作细则”绝不能让战俘知道。要打坏喇叭筒使战俘无法听到解释。（十月上旬发）。四、解释工作开始后，由于要进行游行示威，粮食可能供应不上，现在就要节约粮食，把中午饭节约一半。
    （十月上旬发）。五、要反抗印度部队，要求印度部队撤出朝鲜。（十月上旬发）。六、解释工作快开始了，要想尽一切办法破坏解释工作。具体作法可分三个步骤：第一、坚决不去听解释；第二、思想“巩固”的先去，和解释代表拖延时间；第三、每五个人组成一个小组，其中有一、二人负责，有人回国，负责人就要受到处罚。（十月九日发）。七、如果印度部队使用武力强迫听解释，就要和印度部队“决斗”，夺取印度部队的武器。“我们人多，印度兵只五千人，何况我们背后还有联合国军和大韩民国部队，完全不必担心。”（十月上旬发）。
    李应善还记得，关于加紧控制战俘，阻止战俘表示遣返意愿的指示有：一、进入印度营场后，各大队的“不纯分子”渐渐增多了，要加紧监视；并要进行处理，如看到有人要求遣返就当场杀死。
    （九月下旬发）。二、“在医院里的三、四个赤色分子已经‘处理’过了。你们这里也要这样作。”（十月上旬发）。三、各大队发生病号不要再送到医院去，因已有不少人从医院逃出。重病号送院时必须由特务队审查，去时由两个以上的特务队员跟着。从医院到印度部队营场的一个缺口应由特务队员把守，防止病员在“换药”时逃跑。（十月上旬发）。四、第一次“不纯分子”处理得不彻底，要作进一步“处理”，把一切“不纯分子”都“坚决处理掉！”（十月上旬发）。
    李应善说：这些“指示”是用种种方法传递到各营场的。在九月下旬以前，特务们利用战俘可以在各个营场间来往的机会传递这些“指示”。在印度看管部队禁止各个营场间互相来往以后，特务们就把“指示”绑在石块上从一个营场投掷到另一个营场。十月上旬以后，特务们更利用印度看管部队所允许的“战俘代表”开会时，传递指令和秘密消息。李应善并说：九月底的一个晚上，文重浩曾经特地从四十九号营场跑到四十八号营场，兴高采烈地对他说：“我们的总指挥所是在‘医院’里，一切指示都可以从那里得来；通过医院里的‘护士’，我们已经可以和李总统和美国人联系了。”文重浩的这些话暴露出，他签发的那些破坏解释工作“指示”，正是从美李匪帮那里领受来的。
