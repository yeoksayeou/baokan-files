    In northern Tibet, from the north of the Gangdise Mountains and the Nyainqêntanglha Mountains to the southern foot of the Tanggula Mountains, there is a largest grassland, which is called "Qiangtang" by the Tibetan people (meaning the northern wilderness in Tibetan). Its total area accounts for about two-thirds of the entire Tibet, and the average altitude is above 4,500 meters. The herders living in this area are called "Great Herders" because their pastures are large and they live a purely nomadic life.
    In August of this year, I visited the southern Qiangtang area. Standing on the ridge of the Gangdise Mountains and looking north, among the wave-like layers of silver mountains, there were vast grasslands, densely growing with a fine-leaved, cold-resistant natural pasture. The herders' black yak hair tents were scattered in places with abundant water and grass, forming many large and small tribes. Groups of fat yaks, sheep, and goats grazed near each tribe. The low-lying areas of the plateau constitute thousands of inland lakes. The "Tangra Tso" in the west (meaning the lake of the grassland mountain, called Tanggula Lake on the map) produces some highland barley, which is the only agricultural area in the entire Qiangtang and is regarded as a sacred place by the herders. There are also several large saltwater lakes, with good pastures along the shores. It would take more than ten days or half a month to ride a fast horse around these large lakes. Countless small lakes in the central and northern parts produce inexhaustible salt, alkali, and borax. The northernmost area, accounting for about half of the Qiangtang, is sparsely populated, and herds of wild horses, wild cattle, wild sheep, and foxes roam the wasteland.
    When I entered a tribe in the Yaba pastoral area of Qiangtang, I often saw men with disheveled hair and carrying muskets galloping on horseback on the grasslands. I also often saw women with braids adorned with silver, copper, coral, and other ornaments, barefoot and leading tall herding dogs to drive the herds of cattle and sheep. These herding dogs can drive away wild animals or bring back stray cattle and sheep. The herders welcomed me into their tents, offered me buttered tea and half-cooked fresh meat—their best food—and then we talked like friends.
    August is the busiest season for the herders. The rainfall this year was normal, there were no outbreaks of animal epidemics, and the cattle and sheep were very strong. The sheep had already been sheared (the herders scrape off the shedding wool once a year with knives). The people who went to the northern lake area to collect salt and alkali in June and July also returned one after another. Now is the time when cows and sheep produce the most milk. Early in the morning, the herding women milked the cows in the herds, and then spent the whole day in the tents boiling milk over cow dung fires to make butter. At noon, white milk dregs were drying in front of the tents, the men were mending tents and boots, and the old people were opening their sheepskin robes, baring their arms, and twisting woolen yarn to sew wool pockets. Soon, they will use cattle and sheep to carry wool, butter, salt, alkali, etc., to the Yarlung Tsangpo River area to exchange for grain, tea, and daily necessities, preparing to spend the long, cold winter.
    The hardworking herders have bravely overcome various difficulties. In order to preserve the winter grass, in summer they take their cattle, sheep, and tents to the highlands to graze, enduring hailstorms. In winter, they move to the lowlands, braving the fierce wind and snow to drive the cattle and sheep to break through the deep snow to eat the grass. Young and middle-aged people spend several months of the year traveling long distances, busy collecting salt and exchanging for grain. When animal epidemics break out, the herders drive their cattle and sheep to flee everywhere. The herders in the north often temporarily graze in the more northern, uninhabited grasslands in order to leave the pastures near their tents for the winter, and some also hunt wild animals with muskets. In heavy snowstorms, the song the herders love to sing most is: "Even if the wind and snow are heavy! Put on our fox hats, good companions beside us! My musket sounds like thunder..." In the past, the life of the Qiangtang herders was extremely painful. Before liberation, most of the wool they produced was plundered by imperialists at extremely low prices. The herders received very little grain, some living on milk dregs for months on end, and wearing the same sheepskin robe until the wool was worn out.
    After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the state-owned Tibet Trading Company signed contracts with Tibetan merchants twice, purchasing wool from Tibet at favorable prices, so that the herders began to receive some benefits. Recently, a large amount of wool has been transported from southern Qiangtang. The Yaba pastoral area (about 600 herder households) recently sold more than 1,200 packages of wool, and the price was also higher than in the past. This year, due to the stability of social order, the "Ula" (corvée labor) has been reduced, and more herders have dug salt and alkali than in previous years. Each tribe follows the long-standing habit of helping each other to collect salt, concentrating strong cattle and sheep, and bringing back hundreds or thousands of loads of salt. A herder named Duo Zun happily told me that the salt he brought back could be exchanged for half a year's food.
    Visiting the vast Qiangtang, the time seemed too short. The herders said that it would take a year to just visit a few large pastoral areas. As I retraced my steps on the thin snow on the Gangdise Mountains on my return journey, looking north at this boundless grassland, and thinking of those hardworking and persevering herders, I could not help but feel how vast and great our motherland is!

### 西藏高原上的羌塘

    西藏高原上的羌塘
    新华社记者  赵奇
    在西藏北部，从冈底斯山脉和念青唐古拉山脉以北到唐古拉山脉的南麓，有一片最大的草原，藏族人民称作“羌塘”（藏话，北方荒原之意）的地方。它的总面积约占整个西藏的三分之二，平均高度在海拔四千五百公尺以上。住在这个地区的牧民，被称为“大牧民”，因为他们的牧场大，又过着纯游牧生活。
    今年八月，记者访问了羌塘南部地区。站在冈底斯山的岭上向北看，在那海浪一般的层层银色的山岭间，都是广阔的草地，密密茸茸地生长着一种细叶耐寒的天然牧草。牧民们的黑色牛毛帐篷散布在水多草茂的地方，形成了许多个大小部落。一群群肥大的牦牛和绵羊、山羊放牧在各部落的附近。高原低陷区域构成了千百个内陆湖泊。西部的“唐拉错”（意为草原山之湖，地图上称唐古拉湖）湖边出产一些青稞，这是整个羌塘唯一的一块农业区，被牧民视为圣地。另外还有几个大的咸水湖，湖边都是好牧场。人们如果骑着快马把这些大湖绕一周，就要十天或半月以上。中北部无数的小湖，出产着取之不尽的盐、硷和硼砂。最北部约占羌塘二分之一的地区渺无人烟，成群的野马、野牛、野羊和狐狸在荒地上游荡。
    当我进到羌塘雅巴牧区的一个部落时，常常看到头发蓬松、背着火枪的男人们在草地上骑马奔驰，也常常看到发辫上系着银、铜、珊瑚等饰品的女人们，赤着脚带着高大的牧狗赶着牛羊群。这种牧狗可以驱走野兽或赶回离群的牛羊。牧民们把我接进了帐篷，请我吃酥油茶和半熟的鲜肉——这是他们最好的食品，然后我们就像朋友一样地谈起来。
    八月正是牧民们最忙的季节。今年雨水平常，没闹过兽疫，牛羊都很肥壮，羊毛已经刮过了（牧民每年用刀子把快脱的羊毛刮一次）。六、七月间到北部湖区取盐、硷的人们也陆续回来了。现在正是牛、羊产奶最多的时候。大清早，牧民妇女就在牛群里挤奶子，然后就成天在帐篷里用牛粪火煮奶，提制酥油。中午，帐篷前晒着白花花的奶渣，男人们在缝补帐篷和靴子，老人们敞开羊皮裘赤着臂在搓毛线，缝补毛口袋。不久，他们就要用牛羊驮起羊毛、酥油和盐、硷等，到雅鲁藏布江沿岸一带去换粮食、茶和日用品，准备度过漫长的严寒冬天。
    辛勤的牧民们曾经勇敢地战胜了各种困难。为了保存冬草，夏季他们带着牛羊、帐篷迁到高地去放牧，忍受着冰雹的袭击，冬季又迁到低地，冒着凛冽的风雪赶着牛羊拨开深雪吃草。青壮年一年中有好几个月在遥远的路途中奔波，忙着取盐、换粮。当兽疫流行的时候，牧民们就赶起牛、羊四处躲逃。靠北部的牧民们为了留下帐篷附近草场度冬，常常到更北部荒无人烟的草地去临时放牧，有的还用火枪猎取野兽。在大风雪中，牧民们最爱唱的歌子是：“那怕风雪大啊！戴起我们的狐狸帽，身边的好伙伴啊！我的火枪像雷响……”过去，羌塘牧民的生活是极端痛苦的。解放前，他们生产的羊毛大部被帝国主义者以极低的代价掠夺走了，牧民们得到的粮食很少，有的一连几个月靠奶渣过活，一身羊皮裘一直穿到磨光了羊毛。
    西藏和平解放后，国营西藏贸易公司两次和西藏商人签订合同，优价收购西藏的羊毛，使牧民们开始得到部分利益。最近已有大批羊毛从羌塘南运，雅巴牧区（约六百多户牧民）最近出售的羊毛即有一千二百多包，价钱也比过去提高了。今年由于社会秩序安定，“乌拉”（差役）减少，牧民们挖取盐、硷的也比往年多了，各部落都按照多年的习惯实行取盐互助，集中体壮的牛羊，取回了成百上千驮盐。牧民多尊高兴地告诉我，他取回的盐就可以换回半年的食粮。
    访问辽阔的羌塘，时间显得太不够了，牧民们说，仅仅到几个大牧区走一下，也需要一年的功夫。当我在归途重新踏上冈底斯山岭上的薄雪时，北望这无边无际的草原，想起那些勤劳刚毅的牧民，不由感到我们祖国是多么辽阔伟大！
