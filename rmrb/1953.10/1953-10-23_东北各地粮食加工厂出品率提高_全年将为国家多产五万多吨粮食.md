    Grain processing plants in Northeast China are launching a production increase and thrift campaign centered on increasing the output rate. Recently, the factories have revised their output rate targets. Because this target is higher than the planned target, the whole year will produce 51,721 tons more grain for the country, which can feed 3 million people for a month.
    Now, in order to achieve this goal and save grain for the country, the workers of various factories are vigorously promoting advanced experience and constantly breaking through and improving their competition conditions. According to the statistics of nine state-owned flour mills, after the experience of "front-end flour extraction" was promoted in various factories, the production efficiency has increased by an average of 22.7% compared with the past, and the flour extraction rate has also increased. Shenyang Flour Mill has set a goal of extracting 81.27 jin of flour per 100 jin of wheat, and created a new record of 83.9 jin of flour on October 7. After adjusting the flour path and improving the silk screen equipment, Harbin Flour Mill can produce an average of 1.14 jin more flour per 100 jin of wheat. In terms of rice milling: Dozens of rice mills in Harbin, Shenyang, Changchun, and western Liaoning, eastern Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Jilin have also universally promoted the advanced experience of Shenyang Rice Mill, and the rice yield has been greatly improved. After vigorously promoting several advanced experiences of reducing broken rice and increasing the rice yield, the staff of the millet workshop of Harbin No. 3 Rice Mill has exceeded the national planned target by 4.68%, and can save 847 tons of millet for the country by the end of the year. The rice yield per 100 jin of grain at the Liaoxi No. 4 Grain Processing Plant has also increased from 70 jin to 82 jin.

    东北各地粮食加工厂出品率提高
    全年将为国家多产五万多吨粮食
    东北各地制粉厂、制米厂正深入展开以提高出品率为中心的增产节约竞赛。最近各厂重新修订了出品率指标，因为这个指标比计划指标提高，全年将为国家多产五万一千七百二十一吨粮食，可供三百万人吃一个月。
    现在各厂职工为了实现这个目标，为国家节约粮食，都在大力推广先进经验，不断突破和提高自己的竞赛条件。据九个国营制粉厂的统计，各厂在推广“前路出粉”的经验后，生产效率平均已比过去提高百分之二十二点七，出粉率也有提高。沈阳制粉厂已订出了每百斤小麦出粉八十一点二七斤的奋斗目标，十月七日更创造了出粉八十三点九斤的新纪录。哈尔滨制粉厂调整了粉路、改进了筛绢设备后，平均每百斤小麦可以多出一点一四斤面粉。在制米方面：哈尔滨、沈阳、长春和辽西、辽东、黑龙江、吉林等地的几十个制米厂也已普遍推广沈阳市制米厂的先进经验，出米率已大大提高。哈尔滨第三制米厂小米车间职工，大力推广减少碎米，提高出米率的几种先进经验后，出米率已超过国家计划指标百分之四点六八，到年底可为国家节约小米八百四十七吨。辽西第四粮谷加工厂每百斤粮谷的出米量，也由七十斤提高到八十二斤。    （新华社）
