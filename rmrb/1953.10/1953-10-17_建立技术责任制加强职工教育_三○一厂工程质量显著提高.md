    Establishing Technical Responsibility System and Strengthening Staff Education
    The 301 Factory's Engineering Quality Has Significantly Improved
    The 301 Factory project of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry is one of the key national modern construction projects. During construction last year, due to staff's neglect of engineering quality and technical management, a serious phenomenon of no one being responsible existed on the construction site, and construction management was extremely chaotic, resulting in more than 600 quality accidents of varying degrees. In the first quarter of this year, effective measures were not taken in a timely manner, and the phenomenon of poor quality continued to occur, with a total of 18 accidents of varying degrees. Since April of this year, leading cadres of the construction site have learned from past experiences and lessons, emphasized engineering quality and technical management, and conducted extensive and in-depth quality education for all staff, establishing a series of responsibility systems, which has significantly improved engineering quality. For the completed 2,000 cubic meters of concrete project, the concrete strength generally exceeded the design requirements, and phenomena such as pitting, exposed rebar, and honeycombing were eliminated. In the furnace construction project, the mortar and refractory mud used were tested to meet or exceed the design requirements, and the brick surface elevation water platform fully met the standards. In the installation project, 56 trough shells were installed in a workshop, and the elevation, four-corner level, gap between the trough bottom and the foundation, center error, and shims fully met the requirements. The 32 installed mother machine lathes had center lines and elevations that fully met the standards and were operating well. The metal structure production also fully met the standards. In terms of quality accident losses, the second quarter decreased by 87.4 percent compared to the first quarter, and July decreased by 19 percent compared to the average monthly loss in the second quarter. In terms of the nature of the accidents, 18 major responsibility accidents occurred in the first quarter, only one major responsibility accident occurred in April and May, and only four minor responsibility accidents occurred in June and July, with the quality situation improving month by month.

    建立技术责任制加强职工教育
    三○一厂工程质量显著提高
    中央重工业部三○一厂工程，是国家重点建设的近代化工程之一。这一工程在去年施工中，由于职工忽视工程质量和技术管理工作，在工地里存在着严重的无人负责现象，施工管理异常混乱，先后发生大小质量事故六百多件。今年第一季度施工中，仍未及时采取有效措施，质量低劣的现象还是不断发生，大小事故共有十八件。从今年四月份以来，该工地领导干部接受过去的经验教训，重视了工程质量和技术管理，广泛而深入地对全体职工进行了质量教育，建立了一系列的责任制度，已使工程质量有显著提高。已完成的两千立方公尺的混凝土工程，混凝土强度普遍超过了设计要求，消灭了麻面、漏筋、蜂窝现象。在砌炉工程上，所用灰浆及耐火胶泥均经化验达到或超过设计要求，砖面标高水平台全面达到标准。在安装工程上，某车间槽壳安装五十六台，标高、四角水平、槽底与基础空隙度、中心误差、垫板情况等，完全合乎要求。已安装的三十二台母机车床，中心线和标高，完全合乎标准，运转情况良好。在金属结构制作上，也完全合乎标准。从质量事故损失上来看，第二季度比第一季度降低百分之八十七点四，七月份又比第二季度平均每月损失降低百分之十九。从事故性质上看，第一季度发生十八件较大责任事故，四、五两月只发生一次较大责任事故，六、七月份仅发生四件较小的责任事故，质量情况逐月好转。
