    Learning from Experienced Farmers
    By Our Reporter Gǔ Wéijìn
    Wú Kūnshān is the Party Branch Secretary of the Xúfàn Township in Xīshuǐ County, Húběi Province. He was promoted from the land reform movement. This year, as the township comprehensively concluded land reform and transitioned to production, he felt somewhat unfamiliar with the work of leading production. However, he believed that he had always been enthusiastic about his work and could get things done in any situation. When the spring plowing began, he actively mobilized the masses to respond to the government's call to increase agricultural production, striving to increase grain production by an average of 100 to 200 catties per mu based on last year's production. To ensure increased grain production, he and many other cadres vigorously promoted close planting and topdressing fertilizer.
    However, there was a drought during the transplanting season, and the rice seedlings were drying out and not growing. Some fields had not even been transplanted yet. Wú Kūnshān felt anxious about the issue of increased production. On May 12th, he attended an emergency drought resistance joint meeting of township branch secretaries convened by the district committee. The meeting decided that each township in areas near rivers or lakes must use waterwheels to combat the drought. Wú Kūnshān felt that this decision was very important. When he returned to the township, he convened cadre meetings and mass meetings to mobilize everyone to use waterwheels to combat the drought, but people did not pay much attention to this matter. Some people said that in the past, water was only wheeled when the grain turned yellow, and now the seedlings were still small, so it was not the right time to wheel water. Some people said that the ponds were dry, so where could they wheel water from? Some people said, let's wait for rain, there will definitely be a rainy day.
    When Wú Kūnshān heard these words, he thought: Why don't people pay attention to drought resistance? Don't they want to produce more grain? Of course not. Then he analyzed the reasons and found that the reason why the masses were not mobilized was that the mobilization work was not thorough enough. At the mobilization meetings, only the general principles of drought resistance were discussed, and no practical experience in drought resistance was mentioned. Then, why not talk about the practical experience of drought resistance? he asked himself. But then he asked himself: But what to talk about? For example, the masses believe that the seedlings are small, and it is not the right time to wheel water, what facts can be used to persuade them? Also, for example, many people have the idea of waiting for rain, what facts can be used to make them realize that they should not have this侥幸 mental state? Thinking of this, he realized that there was a weakness in his work: he only had the enthusiasm to lead production, but lacked the practical experience to lead production.
    Something that had been overlooked flashed through Wú Kūnshān's mind. That day, after the district committee convened the emergency drought resistance joint meeting of township branch secretaries and decided to use waterwheels to combat the drought, the district committee secretary repeatedly emphasized: "This year is our first year of learning to lead production. We lack experience, so we must spend more time with experienced farmers, hold Zhūgě Liàng meetings, and learn from experienced farmers." At that time, Wú Kūnshān rejected this suggestion. He thought that he had farmed for so many years, and he was a farmer himself, so who else should he learn from? Now he realized that this idea was not quite right: he was only in his thirties, and the experienced farmers were in their sixties or seventies. The experienced farmers had experienced more things than him, so why not find experienced farmers to study the issue of using waterwheels to combat the drought?
    Along the bank of Wàngtiān Lake, Wú Kūnshān walked towards the ninth natural village in his township. He decided to study the issue of using waterwheels to combat the drought with the experienced farmers in this village, which had many experienced farmers. He chose the home of Cài Jièshòu. Cài Jièshòu was over seventy years old this year. He was surprised by Wú Kūnshān's arrival. When he learned of his intention, he first talked about the following: In 1935, it didn't rain until May or June, and at that time, the seedlings that had grown roots lived, and those that had not grown roots died. From this incident, the experienced farmer called his attention and said: "Now the seedlings have not grown roots yet, and cannot withstand the sun, so they need water very much; with water, they will grow roots, and even if the drought continues now, they can still recover when it rains in the future; if there is no water now, they will not be able to grow roots, and even if it rains in the future, they will not survive." The experienced farmer's remarks caught his attention, and he continued to ask the experienced farmer: "Now the ponds are dry, what should we do to wheel water? Should we wheel lake water to irrigate the fields?" The experienced farmer said: "No. If too much lake water is wheeled into the fields, it will drown the seedlings, and if too little is wheeled in, it will dry out in the sun. We must wheel the lake water into the ponds, and then wheel as much water as the fields need from the ponds. It's not yet time to harvest wheat, so everyone is not busy, and now is the right time to wheel water."
    After listening to the experienced farmer's remarks, Wú Kūnshān gained a lot of practical knowledge about drought resistance. "If I had known these principles earlier," he thought, "the last mobilization to wheel water to combat the drought would not have failed." When he mobilized the masses to wheel water to combat the drought again, everything went smoothly as he expected.
    He convened an enlarged meeting of the branch committee. He reported to everyone the entire process of his visit to the experienced farmer. What was particularly noteworthy was that the experienced farmer, based on his experience in 1935, talked about many practical reasons why it was necessary to wheel water to combat the drought. Everyone felt that these reasons were very important. Township head Cài Xiùfēng said: "In the past, I thought that drought resistance was unnecessary, and that it would be fine to wait for rain, but now after hearing the experienced farmer's remarks, I clearly realized that drought resistance is very important. We must quickly take the lead in drought resistance work." Many cadres examined their own thoughts of not paying attention to drought resistance and said that they would immediately take the lead in drought resistance work.
    After the meeting, the cadres carried out an emergency mobilization for wheeling water to combat the drought throughout the township. The work of wheeling water to combat the drought was launched.
    After the rice was harvested, he and the cadres summarized the production work in this stage. This year's harvest was better than last year's: last year the average yield per mu was 550 catties, and this year the average yield per mu was 720 catties. The reason for the good harvest was first because wheeling water to combat the drought protected the seedlings, and the reason why wheeling water to combat the drought was launched was because he learned drought resistance experience from the experienced farmers. Based on everyone's opinions, he concluded: "Learning the drought resistance experience of the experienced farmers is the main gain in this stage of production work; at the same time, this incident also shows that in order to do a good job in production work in the future, we must humbly learn from the masses, and this is only the beginning of learning."

    向老农学习
    本报记者  古维进
    吴坤山是中共湖北省浠水县徐畈乡党支部书记。他是从土地改革工作中提拔起来的干部。今年乡里全面结束土地改革转入生产时，他对领导生产的工作感到有些生疏；但是他相信，自己一贯对工作积极热情，在任何场合，也能够把工作搞起来的。春耕开始了，他积极动员群众响应政府提高农业生产的号召，争取在去年的生产基础上，每亩田平均增产粮食一二百斤。为了保证粮食增产，他又和许多干部大力推广密植和上追肥。
    但是，插秧时天旱，秧苗干得长不起来，有的田还没有插上秧苗。吴坤山想起增产这件事情，心里很焦急。五月十二日，他参加了区委会召开的乡支部书记紧急抗旱联席会议，会议决定，各乡在靠河或滨湖地区必须车水抗旱。吴坤山感到这个决定很重要，回到乡里，就召开了干部会和群众会，动员大家车水抗旱，但是大家对于这件事情并不重视。有的人说，往年是谷黄时才车水，现在秧苗还小，车水不到时候。有的人说，塘内干了，到那里车水呢？有的人说，等着下雨吧，还能没有个下雨天。
    吴坤山听了这些话，就想：为什么大家不重视抗旱呢？大家不愿意多打粮食吗？当然不是。随后他分析其中的原因，发现没有把群众发动起来的原因，是动员工作不深入。在动员会上，光讲抗旱的大道理，没有讲到抗旱的实际经验。那末，为什么不讲抗旱的实际经验呢？他责问自己。但是，接着自己就问自己：可是讲什么呢？比如说，群众认为秧苗小，车水不到时候，拿什么事实去说服他们呢？又比如说，许多人存在等雨思想，拿什么事实使他们认识到不应该存在这种侥幸心理呢？他想到这里，发觉自己在工作中存在一个弱点：光有领导生产的热情，缺乏领导生产的实际经验。
    一件曾经被忽视的事情掠过吴坤山的脑际。那天区委会召开乡支部书记紧急抗旱联席会议决定车水抗旱之后，区委书记曾经一再强调说：“咱们今年是学习领导生产的第一年，缺乏经验，必须多和老农在一起，开诸葛亮会，向老农学习。”当时吴坤山否定了这个意见。他想自己种了多少年地，自己就是农民，还要向谁学习呢？现在他发现这个想法不大对：自己才三十多岁，老农有六、七十岁，老农经验过的事情，比自己丰富得多，为什么不找老农研究车水抗旱的问题呢？
    沿着望天湖畔，吴坤山向本乡的第九自然村走去。他决定在这个老农众多的村庄和老农研究车水抗旱的问题。他选择了蔡介寿这家。蔡介寿今年七十多岁。他惊讶吴坤山的到来。当他知道他的来意时，首先谈起这样一件事情：一九三五年，天旱到五、六月才下雨，当时秧苗长了根的就活，没有长根的都死了。从这件事情里，老农提起他的注意说：“现在秧苗都还没有长根，经不起晒，很需要水；有了水，长了根，即使现在继续旱下去，将来下了雨，也还能翻过来；如果现在没有水，就长不了根，将来即使下雨也活不成了。”老农的谈话，引起了他的重视，他继续问老农道：“现在塘里干了，车水怎么办呢？车湖水浇田吗？”老农说：“不能。湖水车到田里，太多了会把秧苗淹死，太少了经不起晒就干掉，必须把湖水车到塘里，然后田里需要多少水，就在塘里车多少水。现在还不到割麦时候，大家不忙，车水正是时候呀。”
    听完老农的谈话，吴坤山增加了许多抗旱的实际知识。“如果早懂得这些道理，”他想，“上次动员车水抗旱就不会失败了。”当他再次动员群众车水抗旱时，一切如他所意料的，进行得很顺利。
    他召开了支部扩大会议。向大家报告了访问老农的全部经过，其中特别引人注意的，是老农根据一九三五年的经验，谈到的当前必须车水抗旱的许多实际道理。大家都感到这些道理很重要。乡长蔡秀风说：“我过去认为抗旱是不必要的，等着下雨就成，现在听到老农的谈话，才明确认识抗旱是很重要的。目前要赶快把抗旱工作领导起来。”许多干部都检查了自己不重视抗旱的思想，表示要立即把抗旱工作领导起来。
    会后，干部在全乡进行了车水抗旱的紧急动员。车水抗旱的工作开展起来了。
    稻谷收割完毕后，他和干部总结了这一阶段的生产工作。今年的收成比去年好：去年每亩田平均产量五百五十斤，今年每亩田平均产量七百二十斤。收成好的原因，首先由于车水抗旱保护了秧苗，而所以会搞起车水抗旱，又由于向老农学习了抗旱经验。他根据大家的意见总结说：“学习老农的抗旱经验，是这一阶段生产工作的主要收获；同时从这件事情里，也说明今后要搞好生产工作，必须虚心向群众学习，而这次只是学习的开头。”
