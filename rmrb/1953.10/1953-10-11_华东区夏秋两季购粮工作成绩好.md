The East China region has achieved significant results in grain purchase work during the summer and autumn seasons this year. Starting with wheat acquisition in June and ending at the end of August, the region has exceeded this year's plan, with an acquisition volume reaching 139.42 percent of the original plan, representing 114.25 percent of the acquisition volume for the same period last year. Since the comprehensive commencement of autumn grain acquisition work in August, the acquisition volume had reached 87.34 percent of the third-quarter plan by mid-September, representing 122.47 percent of the acquisition volume for the same period last year.

The Party committees and governments at all levels in East China have attached great importance to this year's grain acquisition work and have strengthened leadership. Before the acquisition began, they conducted policy propaganda and political education for cadres and farmers, and appropriately increased grain prices. According to the average prices after adjusting grain prices in nine major grain markets in East China, namely Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuxi, Wuhu, Hangzhou, Huaiyin, Bengbu, Xuzhou, and Jinan, the wheat price increased by 14.7 percent compared to the same period last year; the prices of autumn miscellaneous grains in markets such as Xuzhou and Huaiyin were generally 5 to 10 percent higher than the same period last year. This has greatly encouraged farmers' enthusiasm for selling grain.

Under the unified leadership of the Party committees and governments, counties in East China generally established grain purchase offices this year, and relevant departments cooperated and divided their work, making appropriate arrangements for grain transfer, transportation, storage, currency issuance, and withdrawal, and preparing for the supply of materials. In particular, cooperatives have fully played their role as assistants to the national economy, enabling grain purchase work to be carried out quickly and thoroughly. For example, Shandong Province established 6,732 acquisition points during the summer grain purchase process this year, which is more than eight times the number of acquisition points self-established by state-owned grain companies.

During the acquisition process, cooperatives in various places have attached great importance to the supply of means of production and means of livelihood. Especially after seeing the fact that the supply of materials in some places affected the development of grain purchase work, they have been planning and preparing for it since July and August. For example, the Shandong Provincial Cooperative General Society successively convened meetings of supply section chiefs of various prefectural branch societies and persons in charge of wholesale and marketing stations of the provincial society in August, focusing on discussing the supply of means of production such as fertilizers and means of livelihood such as daily necessities. The Laiyang Prefectural Branch Society promptly inspected the preparation of material supply, and of the more than 300,000 pieces of agricultural tools planned to be supplied to farmers in the entire prefecture, 201,000 pieces have been prepared, 100,000 pieces have been ordered from industrial cooperatives, and the rest are being organized by local iron and wood craftsmen for processing; in order to help farmers solve the problem of lack of cattle power, they plan to send people to Inner Mongolia to purchase 10,000 head of draft cattle. The Kaihe Liancun Primary Cooperative in the former Nanwang County also adopted the method of holding small exchange meetings when purchasing grain in Wanglibao Village, which was very popular among the masses. They brought currency and 49 kinds of commodities needed by farmers to Wanglibao Village, and in two days, they purchased 32,800 jin of wheat and sold various commodities worth 4.95 million yuan.

Cadres participating in grain purchase work in various places have been able to fully exert their enthusiasm and overcome various difficulties due to increased understanding and clear policies. For example, in the face of insufficient warehouses, various places have tried to strengthen the planning of grain transfer, quick transportation, and quick transfer; temporary open-air warehouses were set up with tarpaulins at various acquisition points; and after grain acquisition, the grain was directly allocated to processing plants in a timely manner. This saves the country a great deal of wealth.

In terms of acquisition business, various places have continuously created various methods to improve work efficiency. For example, the Gushan Primary Cooperative in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, had few people and many things to do when it first started acquisition, and it was too busy to cope. Later, they developed a grading and pricing calculation table and used scientific methods such as "quantitative skinning" to simplify the procedures for inspection, grain receipt, and payment receipt. The work was fast and accurate, saving time and improving efficiency, and no one felt that the work could not be handled.

The main shortcomings in the grain purchase work in East China in the previous period were that the leading cadres in some places did not pay enough attention to this work, and the propaganda was not widespread and thorough enough. This could not better eliminate the phenomenon of some farmers being reluctant to sell grain. In some places, due to the failure of the Party and government leaders to grasp the work tightly and the lack of comprehensive planning, grain purchase work was carried out in isolation, without coordination with other related businesses, resulting in insufficient supply, which affected the development of grain purchase work. For example, in Guancheng County, Shandong Province, in July, 260 million yuan of remittances from other places, 100 million yuan of relief funds, 170 million yuan of agricultural loans, and 130 million yuan of by-product investment funds were received. After farmers received these currencies, they bought most of the wheat because they could not buy the means of production and means of livelihood they needed; of course, they would not sell the wheat they harvested themselves. In other cases, such as Feicheng Cooperative, due to the shortage of daily necessities, illegal private merchants took the opportunity to raise prices and disrupt the market, causing farmers to have a vague view of the prices stipulated by the state. Currently, the above-mentioned areas are overcoming these shortcomings.

### 华东区夏秋两季购粮工作成绩好

    华东区夏秋两季购粮工作成绩好
    【本报讯】    华东区今年夏、秋两季购粮工作有显著成绩。从六月份开始收购小麦，到八月底止，已超额完成今年计划，收购量达原计划的百分之一百三十九点四二，为去年同时期收购量的百分之一百一十四点二五。各种秋粮收购工作从八月全面展开以来，到九月中旬止，收购量已达第三季度计划的百分之八十七点三四，为去年同时期收购量的百分之一百二十二点四七。
    对今年收购粮食工作，华东区各级党委、政府都很重视，并加强了领导。在开始收购以前，就对干部和农民进行了政策宣传和政治教育，同时适当提高了粮价。华东全区根据上海、南京、无锡、芜湖、杭州、淮阴、蚌埠、徐州、济南九个主要粮食市场调整粮价后的平均价格计算，麦价较去年同时期提高百分之十四点七；徐州、淮阴等市场秋季杂粮价格，一般比去年同时期提高百分之五到百分之十以上。这对农民售粮情绪有很大的鼓舞作用。
    在党委、政府的统一领导下，华东各县今年普遍成立了购粮办公室，各有关部门分工合作，对粮食调运、运输、保管、货币投放回笼等工作，作了适当安排，对供应物资也进行了准备。特别是合作社充分发挥了它的国家经济的助手作用，使购粮工作开展得既迅速又深入，如山东全省今年在夏季购粮过程中就建立了六千七百三十二个收购点，约为国营粮食公司自设的收购点八倍以上。
    在收购过程中，对于生产资料和生活资料的供应，各地合作社都非常重视，尤其在看到有些地方因资料供应不上影响了购粮工作开展的事实后，从七、八月份以来，有计划地抓紧了准备工作。如山东省合作总社，在八月份就先后召开各专区分社供应科长、省社批发推销站负责人会议，着重讨论关于肥料等生产资料与日用百货等生活资料的供应问题。莱阳专区分社抓紧对物资供应准备情况作了检查，全专区计划供应给农民的三十余万件农具，已准备好二十万一千件，向工业合作社订做十万件，其余正组织当地铁木手工业者加工；为帮助农民解决牛力缺乏问题，准备派人到内蒙古代买耕牛一万头。原南旺县开河联村基层社，在当地王里堡村购粮时，还采取开小型交流会的办法，很受群众欢迎。他们带着货币和农民所需要的四十九种商品到王里堡村，两天中，就购进了三万二千八百斤小麦，卖出了总值为四百九十五万元的各种商品。
    各地参加购粮工作的干部，由于认识提高，政策明确，在工作中能充分地发挥积极性，克服各种困难。如仓库不足，各地就设法加强调运粮食的计划性，快运、快转；在各收购点用篷席搭好临时露天仓库；粮食收购以后及时地直接拨运加工厂。这就给国家节省了一大笔财富。
    在收购业务上，各地都不断创造出各种提高工作效率的办法。如江苏省江阴县顾山基层合作社，开始收购时人少事多，忙不过来，后来他们制出分等论价计算表，运用“定量除皮”等科学办法，简化了检验、收粮、领款的手续，工作又快又准确，节省了时间，提高了效率，再没有人感到工作应付不了。
    华东区在前一时期购粮工作中所存在的缺点，主要是有些地方的领导干部对这一工作还不够重视，宣传不够普遍、深入。这就不能更好地消除部分农民惜售粮食的现象。有些地方，由于党、政领导抓得不紧，缺乏全面计划，孤立地进行购粮工作，没有与其他有关业务配合进行，致供应不足，影响到购粮工作的开展。如山东省原观城县在七月份有外地汇入款二亿六千万元，救济款一亿元，农贷款一亿七千万元，副产投放款一亿三千万元，农民拿到这些货币后，因买不到自己所需要的生产资料和生活资料，就把它大部分购买了小麦；自己收获的小麦当然更不出售。其他如肥城合作社，因日用百货脱销，不法私商还趁机抬高物价，扰乱市场，使农民对国家规定的牌价，产生模糊的看法。目前，上述地区正在克服这些缺点。
