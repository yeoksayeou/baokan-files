(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 21st) Ladislav Simovic, Representative of Czechoslovakia to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission with the rank of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, issued the following statement to reporters from Xinhua News Agency and the Korean Central News Agency on October 21st:

It is clear from recent news released to the public that members of the Swiss and Swedish delegations to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have disclosed information about the Commission's closed meetings and the attitudes taken by individual members of the Commission.

Since the published information contains rude and inaccurate attacks on the representatives of Czechoslovakia and Poland, the representatives of Switzerland and Sweden should publicly state their position, as they promised to do in the Commission. However, this has not been done to this day.

In the past few days, we have seen more news about the Commission's closed meetings being leaked. This news could only be known by those who attended the meetings.

Some news agencies have reported that the representatives of the Czechoslovak Republic and the People's Republic of Poland withdrew from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission meeting on October 19, 1953. Because these reports distort the facts, providing inaccurate information to the public about the reasons for the Czechoslovak representative's action and the developments leading up to it, I feel it is necessary to correct these reports and clarify the truth.

At the meeting of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on October 19, 1953, an attempt was made to have a majority of the Commission's representatives pass a decision that would greatly undermine the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission."

Paragraph 8 of Article 3 of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" stipulates that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has the responsibility to enable both sides to conduct ninety days of explanations and visits to all prisoners of war belonging to their respective sides. According to Article 23 of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visit Work," which was unanimously adopted, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should enable both sides to conduct explanation and visit work according to their own plans—including the number and category of prisoners of war they wish to explain to and visit—which plans are always submitted to the Secretariat of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission the day before.

At the Commission meeting on October 19, 1953, an attempt was made to have the Commission make a decision that would negate this basic right of the Headquarters of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, forcing them to conduct explanations and visits only to captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, while preventing them from conducting explanations and visits to captured personnel of the Korean People's Army. The excuse put forward by the members of the Commission who wished to pass this illegal decision was that the Syngman Rhee agents maintained a reign of terror in the prisoner-of-war camps, using force to prevent captured personnel of the Korean People's Army from listening to explanations and receiving visits, and that the Indian Custodial Forces could not use the coercive means necessary to break through the terroristic rule of these agents and stop their violence, and therefore could only wait for these agents to agree to the prisoners of war listening to explanations.

The main task of these agents is to obstruct the explanation work, thereby obstructing the implementation of the "Terms of Reference." Once this is taken into account, the unreasonableness of this request becomes obvious.

The decision that was attempted to be forced through the Commission at the Commission meeting on October 19, 1953, not only greatly violates the basic provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visit Work," but also greatly violates the principles previously unanimously adopted by the Commission. The Commission has repeatedly decided that the Indian Custodial Forces should take coercive measures to the extent that agents cannot use force and terror to obstruct prisoners of war from listening to explanations and receiving visits. In view of the situation created by the terroristic rule of the Syngman Rhee agents, the Commission even unanimously adopted a specific decision on October 16, 1953, stipulating that the Indian Custodial Forces could even use weapons in the event of attacks and in the event of collective escapes or attempted collective escapes from the camps.

The decision that was to be forced through the Commission meeting on October 19, 1953, if passed, would completely abandon the Commission's basic mission, making it impossible for the Commission to carry out the tasks it had undertaken. Such a decision, if passed, would mean that the Commission would not only fail to suppress the terror and violence of the agents, but would instead support, strengthen, and "legitimize" this reign of terror.

The Czechoslovak representative to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, bearing in mind the responsibilities undertaken by the Czechoslovak Republic as a neutral country participating in the Commission, could not, for obvious reasons, participate in making such an illegal decision that would jeopardize the Commission's basic mission, and therefore withdrew from the meeting.

Just explaining the situation in the prisoner-of-war camps in the southern part of the demilitarized zone under the Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces or under the Indian Custodial Forces, one can understand the reasons for the situation at the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission meeting on October 19, 1953.

The situation in the above-mentioned prisoner-of-war camps can be summarized as follows.

(1) The "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" stipulates that the Commission shall "ensure that all prisoners of war… have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated." However, contrary to this provision, it is well known—and the Commission itself has repeatedly stated—that due to the terroristic rule of the Syngman Rhee and Kuomintang agents, captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have no way to exercise their rights. Those prisoners of war who have exercised this right have done so at great risk to their lives.

(2) The "Terms of Reference" stipulates: "No force or threat of force shall be used against… prisoners of war to prevent or compel their repatriation, and no violence or insult to their dignity or self-respect shall be allowed against the person of prisoners of war in any way or for any purpose." However, it is well known that, contrary to this provision, prisoners of war are being subjected to the most barbaric acts of violence, including torture and murder, and the Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces or the Indian Custodial Forces have not even investigated.

(3) The "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" stipulates: "The Commission shall also ensure that prisoners of war are treated humanely at all times in accordance with the specific provisions of the Geneva Convention and the general spirit of that Convention." Contrary to this provision, the terroristic rule of the Syngman Rhee and Kuomintang agents is a mockery of the Geneva Convention.

(4) The "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" stipulates that the prisoners of war are placed under the care of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in order to free them permanently from the influence of the former detaining side. Contrary to this provision, this influence on captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers is still being maintained, and the United Nations Command even openly declares in official documents that it has the right to control and "protect" these prisoners of war.

(5) The developments at the Commission's meeting on October 19, 1953, clearly demonstrate that the Commission has not enabled the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to conduct explanations and visits to their captured personnel.

(6) Contrary to the resolutions on disciplinary and punitive measures unanimously adopted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces, or the Indian Custodial Forces, have not taken disciplinary or punitive measures against those who have committed atrocities and other crimes against prisoners of war, not even in the event of murder.

These are some of the many facts that have repeatedly occurred in the prisoner-of-war camps in the southern part of the demilitarized zone.

The reason why this unreasonable situation, which violates the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" in many ways, has arisen is because the Commission, under pressure from certain representatives, has rejected the suggestions of the Czechoslovak and Polish representatives and refused to take effective measures to eliminate the terroristic rule of the agents, isolate and punish those who have committed atrocities and those who have violated the law. Another reason is that even the measures decided by the Commission have not been implemented by the Indian Custodial Forces Command. The task of implementing these measures was entrusted to the Indian Custodial Forces, which act as the Commission's executive agent.

These are the main reasons for the intolerable prisoner-of-war camp situation that seriously endangers the implementation of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission."

It cannot be denied that this situation is serious.

In order to fulfill the Armistice Agreement, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission urgently needs to make a firm determination to strictly implement the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visit Work," and other resolutions adopted by the Commission. The Czechoslovak representative to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, in a spirit of impartiality and respect for international law, will always do everything possible, together with the other representatives of the Commission, to ensure that the Korean Armistice Agreement is strictly and fairly implemented, and to ensure that the Commission strictly guarantees that both sides are equally able to exercise the rights stipulated in the agreements that have been signed, and equally requires both sides to strictly fulfill the obligations undertaken as a result of the agreements that have been signed.

(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 21st) Gajewski, the Polish representative to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, answered questions from reporters from Xinhua News Agency and the Korean Central News Agency on October 21st as follows:

Question: American newspapers and radio stations have reported that the Polish representative withdrew from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission meeting on the 19th of this month. Does this news correspond to the facts?

Answer: Yes, this news corresponds to the facts. However, the news published by American newspapers and radio stations, on the one hand, does not explain the real motives for us to take this step, and on the other hand, it proves this fact: certain members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission or certain personnel of the Commission's Secretariat violated the principles adopted by the Commission and disclosed the proceedings of the Commission's meetings to the press.

This had already happened at the beginning of this month, when the Associated Press and Reuters published news about the proceedings of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission meetings, distorting the attitude taken by the Polish representative, and saying that the news was obtained from the Swiss and Swedish representatives. When I raised this issue at the Commission meeting, these members denied having given such talks to the press; and to this day, they have not published the denial that I asked them to publish, even though they had promised to do so.

Question: Why did the Polish representative withdraw from the meeting?

Answer: The reason why the representative of the People's Republic of Poland withdrew from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission meeting on the 19th was because the majority of the Commission attempted to make a decision that would seriously violate the basic international agreements on which the Commission's work is based. The Polish representative obviously could not participate in making such a decision, because this decision would be completely inconsistent with the status of Poland as a neutral country participating in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

Question: What is the content of the illegal decision that the majority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission attempted to make?

Answer: Everyone knows that according to Article 8 of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and Article 23 of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visit Work," both sides have the right to conduct explanation work to the prisoners of war belonging to them in accordance with the detailed work plans they submit to the Commission's Secretariat twenty-four hours before the explanation work is carried out. These plans also include the requirements put forward by the relevant parties regarding the number and categories of prisoners of war who want to listen to the explanation. According to these provisions, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission obviously has the responsibility to enable the relevant parties to conduct explanation work on any day according to their requirements. The Commission discussed this issue and unanimously agreed to this principle. The Commission also unanimously decided that if prisoners of war are forced to remain in the prisoner-of-war camps and are deprived of the opportunity to listen to explanations as a result of the terroristic methods adopted by the leadership organizations of the Syngman Rhee and Kuomintang agents in the prisoner-of-war camps, then the Indian forces have the right to use the necessary coercive means to break through that terroristic control when necessary.

However, in the case where Korean prisoners of war are under the terroristic control of Syngman Rhee agents and cannot leave the prisoner-of-war camps to listen to explanations, certain members of the Commission, in violation of the decisions previously unanimously adopted by the Commission, opposed taking coercive measures against these agents. In order to justify their attitude, these members argued that if coercive measures were taken, the Indian forces might clash with the prisoners of war, which would inevitably lead to casualties. But our view is that only by breaking the existing terroristic rule of the agents can prisoners of war be spared casualties. In this way, these members not only agreed to the continued existence of the terroristic rule in the prisoner-of-war camps, but in fact also contributed to the terroristic organization and the control of the agents in the prisoner-of-war camps. Moreover, the Commission's agreement to adopt this attitude would inevitably make the Commission's basic task completely impossible to carry out, and the Commission's basic task is to enable both sides to conduct explanation work to all prisoners of war. In this case, the representative of the People's Republic of Poland obviously could not participate in making such a decision.

Question: What is the current situation in the prisoner-of-war camps?

Answer: I have already said that the agents are carrying out a very cruel terroristic rule in the prisoner-of-war camps against those prisoners of war who wish to return home.

Contrary to the suggestions put forward by the representatives of Poland and Czechoslovakia from the very beginning of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's work, the majority of the Commission's members have not taken any action to disband these terroristic organizations, and these terroristic organizations have recently intensified their activities due to the start of the explanation work. Therefore, because the Commission has refused to use coercive methods to stop the evil activities of these agents, thereby further consolidating their control over the prisoners of war, the Commission will create a situation that makes people doubt the Commission's entire work.

Question: Does the withdrawal of the Polish representative from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission meeting mean that the Commission's work has come to an end?

Answer: Of course not. When it is possible for the Commission to carry out its work in accordance with binding international agreements, the Polish representative will definitely participate in the Commission's work in order to fulfill the responsibilities that any truly neutral country's representative should bear.

    捷、波代表分别发表声明和谈话
    指出中立国遣返委员会某些代表企图强使委员会通过纵容美方特务活动的决定，严重危及“职权范围”的执行
    【新华社开城二十一日电】中立国遣返委员会捷克斯洛伐克特命全权大使衔代表拉吉斯拉夫·西莫维茨于十月二十一日向新华通讯社和朝鲜中央通讯社记者发表声明如下：
    从最近向公众发表的消息中，很明显地可以看出：中立国遣返委员会中的瑞士和瑞典的代表团团员曾把委员会举行秘密会议的情况和委员会个别委员所采取的态度透露出来。
    由于所发表的消息中含有对捷克斯洛伐克和波兰代表的无礼而不确实的攻击，因此瑞士和瑞典的代表理应公开表明他们的态度，像他们在委员会中所答应的那样，然而这件事直到现在还没有做。
    而在过去几天中，我们又看到了委员会秘密会议的消息被透露了出来。这种消息是只有参加会议的人才知道的。
    某些通讯社曾发表消息说：捷克斯洛伐克共和国的代表和波兰人民共和国的代表曾在一九五三年十月十九日退出了中立国遣返委员会的会议。由于这些消息歪曲了事实，在捷克斯洛伐克代表采取这个步骤的原因上以及在采取这个步骤以前的种种发展上，向公众提供了不确实的消息，所以，我认为有必要对这些消息加以更正并且澄清事情的真相。
    在一九五三年十月十九日中立国遣返委员会举行会议的时候，曾有人企图使委员会的多数代表通过一项决定，这项决定会大大地破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”。
    “中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第三条第八款规定：中立国遣返委员会有责任使双方能够向属于各自方面的全部战俘进行为期九十天的解释和访问。按照全体一致通过的“解释和访问工作细则”第二十三条的规定，中立国遣返委员会应使双方能够按照他们自己的计划——包括他们希望进行解释与访问的战俘的数字与类别——进行解释与访问工作，这种计划总是在前一天提交给中立国遣返委员会秘书处的。
    在一九五三年十月十九日的委员会会议上，有人企图使委员会作出一项决定，这个决定会取消朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军司令部的这个基本权利，强迫他们只对中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行解释与访问，而阻挠他们对朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行解释与访问。委员会中希望通过这个非法决定的委员们提出的藉口是：李承晚特务在战俘营中保持着恐怖统治，他们用武力阻止朝鲜人民军被俘人员听取解释与接受访问，而印度看管军队又不能使用为突破这些特务的恐怖统治和制止他们暴力行为所必需的强制手段，因此只能等待这些特务来同意战俘听取解释。
    这些特务的主要任务就是阻挠解释工作，从而阻挠“职权范围”的实施。只要考虑到这一点，那末，这个要求的无理就很明显了。
    企图在一九五三年十月十九日委员会会议上强迫委员会通过的这项决定，不仅大大地违反“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的基本规定以及“解释和访问工作细则”，而且也同样大大地违反了委员会以前一致通过的原则。委员会曾一再决定，印度看管军队应采取强制手段，其程度以使得特务不能用武力和恐怖手段阻挠战俘听取解释和接受访问为限。鉴于李承晚特务的恐怖统治所造成的情势，委员会甚至在一九五三年十月十六日就一致通过一项具体的决定，规定印度看管军队在遭到袭击的情况下，和遇到从营房集体逃跑或企图集体逃跑的情况下，甚至可以使用武器。
    在一九五三年十月十九日委员会会议上要委员会通过的这项决定，如经通过，势将完全废弃委员会的基本使命，使得委员会不能执行它已承担的任务。这样一项决定，如经通过，意味着委员会不但不镇压特务的恐怖和暴力行为，反而为这种恐怖统治撑腰，加强这种恐怖统治，并且使之“合法化”。
    中立国遣返委员会捷克斯洛伐克代表牢记着捷克斯洛伐克共和国作为一个中立国参加委员会而承担的责任，为了很明显的理由，他不能参与作出这样一个使委员会的基本任务有不能完成之虞的非法决定，所以就退出了这次会议。
    只要说明一下在非军事区南部在委员会和印度看管军队或者印度看管军队看管下的战俘营里的情况，就可以明白一九五三年十月十九日中立国遣返委员会会议情况产生的原因了。
    上述战俘营的情况可以简述如下。
    （一）“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”规定：委员会应“保证全部战俘……有机会行使其被遣返的权利”。但是与这项规定恰恰相反，大家都知道——而且委员会本身也一再声明——由于李承晚和国民党特务的恐怖统治，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员没有办法行使他们的权利。那些行使了这种权利的战俘，是冒着严重的生命危险才办到的。
    （二）“职权范围”规定：“对……战俘不得使用武力或以武力威胁以阻挠或强使其遣返，不得允许以任何方式或为任何目的，对战俘人身施以暴力或侮辱其尊严或自尊。”但是大家知道，与这个规定相反，战俘们正在遭到最蛮横的暴力行为，包括酷刑和杀害，而委员会和印度看管军队或印度看管军队甚至未予调查。
    （三）“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”规定：“委员会并保证在任何时候均应按日内瓦公约的具体规定及该公约之总精神予战俘以人道的待遇。”与这项规定相反，李承晚和国民党特务的恐怖统治是对日内瓦公约的嘲弄。
    （四）“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”规定：由中立国遣返委员会来看管战俘，是为了使他们能永远摆脱前拘留一方的影响。与这项规定相反，这种对朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员的影响仍旧被保持着，而且联合国军司令部甚至在正式的文件中也公然宣称有权控制和“保护”这些战俘。
    （五）委员会一九五三年十月十九日的会议上的发展清楚地说明，委员会并没有使朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面能够对他们的被俘人员进行解释和访问。
    （六）与中立国遣返委员会所一致通过的关于惩戒和刑罚措施的决议相反，委员会和印度看管军队，或者印度看管军队，并没有对那些干出迫害战俘的暴行和其他罪行的人采取惩戒或刑罚措施，甚至遇到谋杀事件也未采取这种措施。
    这些就是在非军事区南部战俘营中一再发生的许多事实中的一些事实。
    这种在许多方面违反“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的毫无道理的情况，其所以产生的原因，是由于委员会在某些代表的压力下，拒绝了捷克斯洛伐克和波兰代表的建议，不肯采取有效措施清除特务分子的恐怖统治，把那些犯了暴行的人和那些干犯法纪的人隔离开来并加以惩罚。另一种原因是甚至委员会所决定的措施，印度看管军司令部也未曾执行。而执行这种措施的任务却是托付给作为委员会的执行代理人的印度看管军队的。
    这些就是严重地危及“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的执行的令人不能容忍的战俘营情况之所以产生的主要原因。
    不能否认这种情势是严重的。
    为了履行停战协定起见，中立国遣返委员会迫切需要下定决心，严格执行“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”、“解释和访问工作细则”以及委员会所通过的其他决议。中立国遣返委员会捷克斯洛伐克代表本着公正无私和尊重国际法的精神，将始终尽一切力量，与委员会的其他代表们一道保证朝鲜停战协定得到严格和公正的执行，并保证委员会严格做到同等地保证双方都能够行使在业已签订的各项协定中规定的权利，并同等地要求双方严格地执行由于签订的各项协定而承担的义务。
    【新华社开城二十一日电】中立国遣返委员会波兰代表加耶夫斯基于十月二十一日答复新华通讯社和朝鲜中央通讯社记者提出的问题如下：
    问：美国报纸和电台发表消息说，本月十九日，波兰代表退出了中立国遣返委员会的会议。这个消息和事实相符吗？
    答：是的，这个消息是和事实相符的。但是，美国报纸和电台所发表的消息，一方面没有说明我们采取这种步骤的真正动机，另一方面，它证明了这个事实：中立国遣返委员会的某些委员或委员会秘书处的某些人员违背委员会所通过的原则，把委员会的会议进行情况透露给报界。
    这种事情在本月初已经发生过，当时合众社和路透社发表了关于中立国遣返委员会会议进行情况的消息，歪曲波兰代表所采取的态度，并说这项消息是从瑞士和瑞典代表处得到的。当我在委员会的会议上提出这个问题时，这些委员否认曾向报界发表过这种谈话；而且直到今天为止还没有发表我要求他们发表的否认，尽管他们曾答应发表。
    问：波兰代表为什么要退出会议？
    答：波兰人民共和国代表所以在十九日退出中立国遣返委员会的会议，是因为委员会中的大多数企图作出一个决定，而这个决定将严重地违反委员会进行工作所根据的基本国际协定。波兰代表显然不能参与作出这样的决定，因为这种决定将完全不符合波兰作为一个中立国参加中立国遣返委员会的身分。
    问：中立国遣返委员会的大多数所企图作出的非法决定的内容是什么？
    答：大家知道，根据“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第八款及“解释和访问工作细则”第二十三条的规定，双方都有权利按照他们在解释工作进行前二十四小时送交委员会秘书处的详细工作计划向他们所属的战俘进行解释工作。这些计划还包括了有关方面所提出的关于要听取解释的战俘的数目和类别的要求。根据这些规定，中立国遣返委员会显然有责任使有关方面能按照他们的要求在任何一天进行解释工作。委员会曾讨论了这个问题，并一致同意了这个原则。委员会并一致决定，如果由于李承晚和国民党特务在战俘营中的领导组织采取恐怖手段的结果使战俘被迫留在战俘营内而被剥夺了听取解释的机会，那末，印度部队就有权在必要时以必需的强迫手段去击破那种恐怖的控制。
    但是，在朝鲜战俘受到李承晚特务的恐怖控制而不能离开战俘营去听解释的情况下，委员会某些委员却违反委员会早先一致通过的决定，反对对这些特务采取强迫办法。这些委员为了替自己的态度作辩解，他们争辩说，如果采取强迫办法，印度部队可能和战俘发生冲突，因而不免发生死伤事件。但是我们的看法是：只有打破现在存在的特务恐怖统治，才能使战俘避免遭到死伤。这样，这些委员不仅同意战俘营中恐怖统治继续存在，事实上，也助长了战俘营中的恐怖组织和特务的控制。并且，委员会同意采取这种态度，其结果必然会使得委员会的基本任务完全无法执行，委员会的基本任务是使双方对所有战俘都能进行解释工作。在这种情况下，波兰人民共和国代表显然不能参与作出这样一个决定。
    问：目前战俘营内的情况如何？
    答：我已经说过，特务们正在战俘营内对那些希望回家的战俘实行一种非常残酷的恐怖统治。
    与波兰和捷克斯洛伐克两国的代表从中立国遣返委员会开始办公之初便提出的建议恰恰相反，委员会的多数委员丝毫没有采取任何行动来解散这些恐怖组织，而这些恐怖组织最近由于解释工作的开始已变本加厉地活动起来。因此，由于委员会拒绝以强迫方法来制止这些特务们的罪恶活动，从而进一步地巩固了他们对战俘的统治，这样，委员会将造成一种令人对委员会的全部工作感到怀疑的情况。
    问：波兰代表退出中立国遣返委员会会议，是不是意味着委员会的工作宣告结束了呢？
    答：当然不是这样的。等到委员会有可能按照具有约束性的国际协定来执行它的工作的时候，波兰代表将一定参加委员会的工作，以履行任何真正中立国家代表所应负的责任。
