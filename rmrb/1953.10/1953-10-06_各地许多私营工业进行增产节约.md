    Many Private Industries in Various Places Increase Production and Practice Economy

    [Report from this newspaper] Under the leadership of the People's Government, private industries in various places have successively launched campaigns to increase production and practice economy in order to improve business management, improve product quality, and reduce costs, and have achieved some results.
    Private industries in cities such as Wuhan and Taiyuan began to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy as early as August last year. Output has increased significantly, quality has improved, and costs have also been reduced. In Wuhan, private industrial enterprises that have launched the campaign to increase production and practice economy have generally increased production by 30% to 50%. In the Jianghan District, the rate of substandard cloth in nine weaving factories has dropped from 20% to below 1%. Now, the monthly output of towels from the No. 1 Zhongdian Textile Factory in the city can reach up to 5,000 dozens, an increase of more than four times compared to before the campaign to increase production and practice economy. The defective rate has also dropped from 40% to 0.7%, and the scrap rate has dropped from 5% to 1%. In Taiyuan, the employees of 58 private factories found 59 tricks, improved 27 kinds of tools, and increased production by 1.029 billion yuan in three months. This year, private industries in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Harbin, Lanzhou, Qiqihar, Hangzhou, Guiyang, Tangshan and other cities have successively launched campaigns to increase production and practice economy. In Tianjin, there are currently 400 private factories with more than 20,000 employees involved in the production increase and economy practice competition.
    One of the key points for private industries to increase production and practice economy is to grasp the key issues in the operation and management of each factory and solve them. In the past, Guangzhou Huaxin Cloth Factory often lost yarn and cloth during processing. After concentrating its efforts to eliminate cloth dismantling in the campaign, it overfulfilled the second quarter processing task by 2.95% this year. The saved cotton yarn can weave 95 pieces of "40" twill and 86 pieces of "42" twill. Wuhan Xinya Paper Mill originally had low output and poor quality. In the campaign, it focused on improving the operating techniques of cooking and pulping, and completed the production plan every month. The cost of each ton of paperboard was also reduced by 185,000 yuan. Secondly, since the products of private industries are generally of low quality and high cost, many private factories pay great attention to promoting advanced production experience in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. In the second half of this year, Tianjin began to promote the assembly line operation method of making rubber shoes in the rubber industry. The output of general factories increased by more than 30%. According to statistics from 13 cotton spinning factories in Shenyang, from late April to the end of June this year, the quality of products increased by an average of 11.3%, and the highest increased by 27.7% due to the promotion of advanced experience. Shanghai's motor manufacturing plants have jointly designed more than 140 new specifications of motors. On the one hand, it lays the foundation for gradually unifying the product specifications of the industry to be included in the national plan. At the same time, it also saves a lot of wealth; only the result of the trial production of new specifications of fully enclosed motors by Shanghai Huacheng Factory can save 5.7 billion yuan throughout the year.
    The employees in private industries have demonstrated the fine qualities of the working class of being selfless and altruistic in increasing production and practicing economy, which is the decisive factor for the success of the campaign to increase production and practice economy in private factories. According to preliminary statistics in Wuhan, employees put forward more than 6,000 rationalization proposals in the campaign. The employees of ten factories in Lanzhou improved 12 kinds of tools in two months, which increased production efficiency by two to three times. The employees of three weaving factories in Taiyuan improved the weaving sizing method, which is expected to save 1.67542 billion yuan throughout the year. The pulp workers of Hangzhou Huafeng Paper Mill created a high-temperature bleaching method, which can save 120 million yuan per month for bleaching powder alone. The employees of Shanghai Tianyi Printing and Dyeing Factory modified the mercerizing machine, which can increase the production of mercerized cloth by about 400,000 pieces per year.
    Some private industries have conscientiously implemented the policy of benefiting both labor and capital in increasing production and practicing economy. On the basis of increasing production and reducing costs, they have improved production conditions and the welfare of employees, and the capitalists have also increased their due income. After the private iron industry in Taiyuan launched the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the welfare benefits of employees increased by 24.55% on the original basis; the factory in the city that launched the campaign added machine tool equipment worth 233.88 million yuan in three months due to increased revenue.
    At present, the development of the campaign to increase production and practice economy in private industries is still very uneven. Some places have not yet started, and the places that have started are not wide and deep enough. Some capitalists do not have a correct understanding of increasing production and practicing economy, so they have not assumed their due responsibilities. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen education and leadership for them, overcome these shortcomings, and make the campaign to increase production and practice economy in private industries more widespread and in-depth.

    各地许多私营工业进行增产节约
    【本报讯】各地私营工业在人民政府的领导下，为了改善经营管理，提高产品质量，降低成本，已陆续开展增产节约运动，并且取得了一些成绩。
    武汉、太原等城市的私营工业从去年八月就开始进行增产节约运动，产量显著增加，质量已有提高，成本也降低了。武汉市开展增产节约的私营工业户，生产量一般提高百分之三十至五十。江汉区有九个织布厂的次布率由百分之二十降低到百分之一以下。现在该市一中电机织物厂的毛巾月产量最高可达五千打，比较开展增产节约运动以前提高了四倍多，次品率也由百分之四十降到百分之零点七，废品率由百分之五降到百分之一。太原市五十八个私营工厂的职工，在三个月中找出窍门五十九个，改进工具二十七种，增产十亿二千九百多万元。今年北京、天津、沈阳、上海、广州、哈尔滨、兰州、齐齐哈尔、杭州、贵阳、唐山等城市的私营工业都陆续开展增产节约运动。天津市目前已有四百户私营工厂，两万多职工投入增产节约竞赛。
    私营工业开展增产节约的重点之一，是要抓住各个工厂经营管理中的关键问题加以解决。广州市华新布厂过去在加工中经常赔纱赔布，在运动中集中力量消灭了拆布现象以后，便超额完成今年第二季加工任务百分之二点九五，节约的棉纱可织“四○”斜纹布九十五匹和“四二”斜纹布八十六匹。武汉新亚造纸厂原来产量低、质量差，在运动中抓紧改进蒸煮、打浆的操作技术，月月完成生产计划，每吨纸版的成本也降低了十八万五千元。其次，由于私营工业的产品一般是质量低、成本高，因此，许多私营工厂在增产节约运动中很注意推广先进生产经验。天津市今年下半年开始在橡胶业中推行做胶鞋的流水作业法，一般工厂的产量增加百分之三十以上。据沈阳市十三个棉纺工厂统计，今年四月下旬至六月底，由于推广了先进经验，产品质量平均提高了百分之十一点三，最高提高了百分之二十七点七。上海市各电机制造厂共同设计了一百四十多种电动机的新规格，一方面为逐步统一该业产品规格以纳入国家计划轨道打下基础，同时还节约了大量财富；仅上海市华成厂试制新规格全封闭电动机的结果，全年即可节约五十七亿元。
    私营工业中的职工在增产节约中发挥了工人阶级大公无私的优良品质，这是私营工厂增产节约运动获得成绩的决定因素。据武汉市的初步统计，职工在运动中提出了六千余件合理化建议。兰州市十个工厂的职工，在两个月中改进工具十二种，使生产效率提高两倍到三倍。太原市三个织布厂职工改进了织布浆纱方法，预计全年可节约十六亿七千五百四十二万元。杭州市华丰造纸厂浆间工人创造了高温漂浆法，只漂粉一项，一个月即可节约一亿二千万元。上海天一印染厂职工改装了丝光车，每年可增产丝光布约四十万匹。
    有些私营工业在增产节约中认真贯彻了劳资两利政策，在提高生产、降低成本的基础上，改善了生产条件与职工的生活福利，资方也增加了应得的收益。太原市私营铁工业开展增产节约运动后，职工的福利待遇在原基础上提高了百分之二十四点五五；该市开展运动的厂方因为收益增加了，三个月中增添的机具设备值二亿三千三百八十八万元。
    目前私营工业增产节约运动的发展还很不平衡，有些地方还没有动起来，已开展的地方也不够广泛和深入，某些资本家对于增产节约的认识还不够正确，因此还没有负起应有的责任，因此，必须加强对他们的教育和领导，克服这些缺点，使私营
  工业的增产节约运动更广泛更深入地开展起来。
