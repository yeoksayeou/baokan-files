Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 23rd: The Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea held a慰问 (comfort) conference in the auditorium of the Central Committee Headquarters of the Korean Workers' Party in Pyongyang on the evening of the 23rd to express sympathy to the leaders of the North Korean party and government organs, senior generals of the Korean People's Army, and leaders of various democratic parties and social organizations, totaling more than 800 people. Also invited to attend were diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from the Soviet Union, China, and various People's Democratic countries stationed in North Korea, as well as Gan Yetao, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in North Korea, and embassy staff.

At 7 p.m., the presidium took its place amid warm applause. The presidium included: the heads of the delegation, led by General He Long; Park Jung-ae and Kim Il, Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party; Choi Yong-kun, Deputy Commander of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army, Deputy Prime Minister of the Cabinet, and Minister of National Security; Hong Myung-hee, Park Ui-wan, and Choi Chang-ik, Deputy Prime Ministers of the Cabinet; Hong Ki-ju, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly; Kim Dal-hyun and Li Young-ho, Vice Chairmen of the Supreme People's Assembly, and other party, government, and military leaders; Li Da, Chief of Staff of the Chinese People's Volunteers; and Gan Yetao, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in North Korea.

The 慰问 (comfort) conference began with the national anthems of North Korea and China. The delegation's art troupe lined up on stage to present flowers to the North Korean leaders to pay respect, and the audience stood up and applauded unanimously.

General He Long, head of the delegation, delivered a message of sympathy amid warm applause. He first expressed his highest respect and warm sympathy on behalf of the Chinese people and Chairman Mao Zedong to the heroic Korean people and Kim Il-sung, the close friend of the Chinese people. After recounting the victories of the Korean people in the past three years, especially citing the victory of annihilating more than 10,000 enemies at Heartbreak Ridge, he pointed out: The enemy calls this nameless highland Heartbreak Ridge. This name is very appropriate. The more heartbroken the enemy is, the more brilliant the victory of the Korean People's Army is. Let the wicked enemy be heartbroken. The Korean people under the leadership of Premier Kim Il-sung have stood up in the world. This is a victory for the Korean people, a common victory for the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and a victory for the world's peace, democracy, and socialist camp led by the Soviet Union.

After describing the significance of this victory, General He Long said: The people of China and North Korea have forged fraternal friendship and unity in the common cause of opposing American aggressors. The close cooperation and support of the Korean people for the Chinese People's Volunteers demonstrate the lofty spirit of combining patriotism and internationalism. Such a heroic and excellent nation will always be respected by the Chinese people and the people of the world!

General He Long said: I warmly congratulate the great victory of the Korean people. The Korean people under the leadership of Premier Kim Il-sung have become a glorious banner against aggression and for national liberation, a symbol of heroism and honor, and a defender of peace in the Far East. All peace-loving people in the world look at you with gratitude and congratulate you, because your victory has also defended the peace of all countries. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the great victory of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, because these two victorious armies have not only defended the sacred territory of Korea, but also defended the security of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people will never forget this great achievement.

General He Long finally said: Dear comrades and friends! The Chinese People's Delegation to Korea has brought the Chinese people's love, respect and gratitude to the Korean people, and we have also brought the determination to continue to assist you. I once again express my cordial sympathy to the Korean people. We are not only united by blood, but also the hearts of the people of China and North Korea are connected. Our cause of opposing US imperialism and striving for world peace is also linked together.

After the speech, the presentation of gifts began. Members of the delegation presented gift lists and commemorative badges to Korean leaders such as Park Jung-ae, Kim Il, Park Chang-ok, Choi Yong-kun, Jung Il-ryong, Choi Chang-ik, Hong Myung-hee, Park Ui-wan, Kim Dal-hyun and Bai Nan-yun, representatives of Korean party and government agencies and social organizations. After receiving the gifts, the recipients warmly shook hands with General He Long and the gift presenters, expressing their gratitude. At this time, the audience stood up, and there was a long and uninterrupted applause.

Bai Nan-yun, representative of the Korean party and government organs and social organizations, delivered a reply speech. He first expressed his deep gratitude to the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, the government of the People's Republic of China, and Chairman Mao Zedong, the beloved leader of the Chinese people. He said: During the most serious period of the Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War against the American aggressors, the great Chinese people held high the sacred banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, not only sending their beloved children to the front lines in Korea to support us with blood, but also constantly providing us with material and spiritual assistance. The immortal feats and lofty moral qualities of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people—the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers—on the Korean front will forever radiate light along with the prosperity of our country. He then said: We are confident that with the support of the people of the fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union, our struggle to restore and develop the post-war people's economy and to strive for the peaceful reunification and independence of our motherland will surely be victorious. He finally wished the Chinese people glorious new victories in the cause of building their own country and defending lasting peace in Asia and the world.

At 8:30, the 慰问 (comfort) conference ended with the national anthems of North Korea and China. After the meeting, the delegation performed wonderful 慰问 (comfort) programs such as songs, dances, acrobatics, and Peking opera.
