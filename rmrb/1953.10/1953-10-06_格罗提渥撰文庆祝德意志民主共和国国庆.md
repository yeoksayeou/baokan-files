Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 5th: According to TASS Moscow, October 4th, to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic on October 7th, the Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" published an article by Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, entitled: "The Bulwark of the Peace-Loving Forces of the German People."

Grotewohl wrote that the past four years have given the German people great lessons. The development of international relations shows that only when Germany is united peacefully, becomes a peaceful, democratic, and independent country, and only when it obtains its position in Europe on an equal basis through friendly cooperation with all peace-loving countries, can European peace be maintained and consolidated.

Grotewohl talked about the economic policy of the government of the German Democratic Republic, pointing out that this policy has consistently been one of promoting the continuous development of the national economy of the Republic. The new course adopted by the government in June 1953, based on the proposal of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, is a policy of continuing to increase the happiness of the people.

He said: The realization of the new course will make the current historical task of the German people—the peaceful reunification of Germany—easier and faster to accomplish. Grotewohl pointed out that the fraternal and selfless assistance given by the Soviet Union to the German people has enabled the German people to realize the new course much faster and to transform the German Democratic Republic into a model democratic country.

Grotewohl then talked about the Soviet government's note of September 28th to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States, pointing out that this note once again vividly demonstrated the Soviet Union's consistent peace policy and sincere desire for a peaceful resolution of the German question.

Grotewohl pointed out that the policies of the Western countries and their lackey Adenauer are hindering the rapid and peaceful resolution of the German question. Adenauer's plan is a war plan to revive German imperialism. Its purpose is to establish a military alliance between American and German imperialists, restore West Germany's war industry, and establish a German aggressor army as a shock force in a new world war.

He said: The fact that Adenauer can continue to be in power in West Germany does not mean in the slightest that the German people agree with Adenauer's aggressive policy. On the contrary, the German people urgently hope for the unification of their country and hope for peace. Whoever opposes the noble national efforts of the German people will sooner or later be overthrown by the people's anger.

Grotewohl concluded by writing: The government of the German Democratic Republic will continue to strengthen the Republic as a bulwark of the German people's struggle for national independence and peace.

    格罗提渥撰文庆祝德意志民主共和国国庆
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：为庆祝十月七日德意志民主共和国建国四周年，苏联“消息报”发表了德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥的文章，题目是：“德国人民爱好和平力量的堡垒”。
    格罗提渥写道，过去四年给予德国人民很大的教训。国际关系的发展说明：只有德国以和平方式统一起来，变成一个和平、民主、独立的国家，只有它通过与所有爱好和平国家的友好合作，在平等基础上取得它在欧洲的地位，欧洲的和平才能维持与巩固。
    格罗提渥谈到民主德国政府的经济政策，指出这个政策过去与现在一贯是促进共和国国民经济的不断发展的政策。政府在一九五三年六月根据德国统一社会党的建议采取的新方针，是继续增进人民幸福的政策。
    他说：新方针的实现将使德国人民当前的历史任务——和平统一德国——能更容易和更迅速地完成。格罗提渥指出，苏联给予德国人民的兄弟般的、无私的援助，使得德国人民能够快得多地实现新方针，并把德意志民主共和国变成一个模范的民主国家。
    格罗提渥接着谈到苏联政府九月二十八日致法、英、美三国政府的照会，他指出，这个照会再一次生动地表现了苏联一贯的和平政策及和平解决德国问题的真诚愿望。
    格罗提渥指出，西方国家以及它们的走卒阿登纳的政策阻碍了德国问题的迅速的与和平的解决。阿登纳的计划是一个复活德国帝国主义的战争计划。它的目的是要建立美德帝国主义者之间的军事同盟、恢复西德战争工业、并建立一支德国侵略军作为新的世界大战中的突击队。
    他说：阿登纳能够在西德继续当权下去的事实，丝毫也不意味着德国人民同意阿登纳的侵略方针。相反的，德国人民迫切地希望他们的国家统一，希望和平。谁要是反对德国人民的崇高民族努力，他就早晚会被人民的愤怒打倒。
    格罗提渥最后写道：德意志民主共和国政府将继续加强共和国，作为德国人民争取国家独立与和平的斗争的堡垒。
