The first volume of the Chinese edition of "Complete Works of Stalin" has been published by the People's Publishing House. Starting today, it will be distributed in twenty-five cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Gui Sui, Shenyang, Harbin, Anshan, Dalian, Changchun, Ulanhot, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jinan, Fuzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changsha, Nanchang, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Dihua. Distribution in other regions will begin after November 7th.

The first volume of "Complete Works of Stalin" includes thirty articles by Stalin from January 1901 to April 1907, along with an appendix. The volume begins with a preface to the first volume written by Stalin himself.

The articles included in the first volume of "Complete Works" are writings from the early period of Stalin's revolutionary activities.

During this period, the Russian revolutionary movement gradually surged, and the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party had been formed. After the Second Congress of the Party in 1903, two factions emerged: the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. This period included the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 and the First Revolution of 1905, the convening of the Third and Fourth Party Congresses, and the convening and dissolution of the First and Second State Dumas.

During this period, Lenin successively published great works such as "What Is To Be Done?", "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back," and "Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution," laying the foundation for the ideology, organization, and tactics of the Marxist-Leninist party.

During this period, Stalin established Lenin's Iskra (Spark) faction, i.e., Bolshevik organizations, in Tiflis, Baku, Batum, Kutaisi, and other places in the South Caucasus, and led the activities of these organizations. He personally organized many workers' groups, lectured them, established secret printing houses, founded newspapers, wrote articles, gave reports, distributed leaflets, and directly led strikes and organized demonstrations.

During this period, Stalin waged an irreconcilable struggle against all kinds of anti-Marxist and opportunist factions in his writings, demonstrated and defended the basic principles of Marxist-Leninist doctrine, and assisted Lenin in laying the foundation for the ideology, organization, and tactics of the Marxist-Leninist party.

Lenin's book "What Is To Be Done?" (1902) is the ideological foundation of Marxism, while Stalin's "A Brief Account of the Differences in the Party" (1905) developed and defended this ideological system, demonstrated that the Marxist party is the combination of the workers' movement and socialism, thoroughly exposed the ideological roots of opportunism, and raised the role of theory and the Party to the proper height.

Lenin's book "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back" (1904) laid the organizational foundation of the Marxist party, while Stalin's "The Proletariat and the Proletarian Party" (1905) developed and defended this basic organizational principle, elucidated the doctrine of the Marxist party, and explained that the Party is the leading organization of the proletariat, the basic weapon in the hands of the proletariat, and only with this weapon can the struggle for the dictatorship of the proletariat be victorious.

Lenin's book "Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution" (July 1905) laid the tactical foundation of the Marxist party, while Stalin's articles "Armed Uprising and Our Tactics" (July 1905) and "The Provisional Revolutionary Government and Social-Democracy" (August 1905) developed and defended this basic tactical principle, ideologically shattered the petty-bourgeois tactical line of the Mensheviks, armed the Russian working class to further expand the bourgeois democratic revolution, and pointed out the clear future of the socialist revolution.

Stalin's brilliant Marxist-Leninist classic work "Anarchism or Socialism," published in 1906, played the same role in defending the theoretical foundations of Marxism as Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" (1909). In "Anarchism or Socialism," Stalin used simple and concise language to expound and demonstrate the dialectical method, the theory of materialism, and the socialism of the proletariat, thoroughly criticizing the various unscientific and reactionary ideas of anarchism, and pointing out the inevitable demise of capitalism and the inevitable victory of the proletarian revolution. After pointing out the vision of the future socialist society, Stalin affirmed that "what inevitably follows capitalism is the socialist system, just as day inevitably follows night." Almost fifty years ago, Stalin thus demonstrated the inevitability of socialist revolution and determined the role and tasks of the Bolshevik Party. This glorious task was finally accomplished, and the vision of socialist society that Stalin described fifty years ago has now finally been realized.

The first volume of "Complete Works of Stalin" contains more than thirty articles. In addition to the aforementioned classic treatises that elaborate on Marxist-Leninist thought, organization, tactics, and theoretical foundations, the first article is the editorial "From the Editorial Board" written by Stalin for the first Georgian newspaper of the Tiflis Social Democratic organization he founded, "Struggle Newspaper" (founded in September 1901). In this programmatic article, he briefly and clearly described the situation of the revolutionary movement in the Caucasus and the entire Russia at that time, pointed out and stipulated the direction and path of the South Caucasus workers' revolutionary movement, and linked it with the revolutionary movements in all of Russia and the world. In the article "The Russian Social Democratic Party and its Current Tasks" (November 1901), he gave a very concise and comprehensive account of the entire development process of scientific socialism and the history of the workers' movement. This work begins with how mankind, after countless sufferings, finally scientifically researched and demonstrated the theory of socialism, and succinctly explains how socialism changed from utopian to scientific, how the workers' movement changed from a spontaneous and unorganized state to a conscious and organized state, how socialist ideas combined with the workers' movement in Russia, and how the scattered struggles of individual workers' groups against individual owners were unified and merged into a general class struggle. This work points out that it is wrong to be confused by distant goals and abandon the current struggle, and it is also wrong to be satisfied with the current struggle and not pursue the ultimate goal. It reveals that the true face of the Economists is opportunism, elucidates the significance of socialism to the working class, proves the role of the Marxist party in the working class struggle, and further specifically points out the current tasks of the Russian Social Democratic Party—to overthrow the autocratic system and strive for a democratic constitution, with political struggle as the main task.

As early as before 1901, Stalin discovered that Lenin was the most exemplary leader of the proletarian revolutionary struggle. When the Social Democratic Labor Party split into two factions, the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, in 1903 due to differences of opinion, Stalin immediately stood on Lenin's side, the Bolshevik side. In the two "Letters from Kutaisi" (1904), Stalin fully showed how actively he defended Lenin's position and opposed the Menshevik opportunists headed by Plekhanov. After refuting the fallacy that "the spontaneous movement itself will produce socialism," he called the theory of socialism created "completely independent of the spontaneous movement" "Lenin's thought," "I call it Lenin's thought because no one in Russian literature has said it as clearly as Lenin." Stalin greatly respected Lenin, calling Lenin a visionary and unwavering "true mountain eagle." In his many outstanding works, he defended Lenin's line, demonstrated the scientific theory of socialism and the combination of socialism and the workers' movement. He waged a merciless struggle against Mensheviks, anarchists, nationalists, and all other anti-Marxist-Leninist opportunists, exposing their absurd ideas and treacherous behavior.

As one of the important policies of the Party at that time, the land issue was specifically explained and profoundly elaborated by Stalin in three articles: "The Land Question," "On the Land Question," and "On Revising the Land Program" (all works of 1906). On the national question, which became a serious problem in multi-ethnic Russia, Stalin expounded the exemplary Marxist viewpoint in the article "How Does Social Democracy Understand the National Question" (1904). In addition, in the two mobilizing articles "Long Live the Friendship of All Nationalities!" and "Proclamation to the Citizens. Long Live the Red Flag!", in addition to exposing the Tsarist government's vicious policies, he also clearly put forward the Party's specific propositions on the national question.

In order to defend the Party's correct line and policies, in the above-mentioned "A Brief Account of the Differences in the Party," "Armed Uprising and Our Tactics," and "The Provisional Revolutionary Government and Social-Democracy," and in the "Reply to the Social Democrat Newspaper," "The State Duma and the Tactics of the Social Democratic Party," "On the Current Situation," "The Current Situation and the Unification Congress of the Workers' Party," and other articles, Stalin used various examples to sharply criticize the Mensheviks and all anti-Marxist-Leninist opportunists, incisively expounded the Marxist-Leninist point of view, and explained in detail the root causes of the differences of opinion and the irrefutable correctness of the Bolsheviks, so that advanced workers could understand the true situation of the differences of opinion within the Party and the correct position of Lenin and the Bolsheviks.

During the period from 1901 to 1907, when Stalin was carrying out revolutionary activities in the South Caucasus, mainly in Tiflis, he wrote many highly agitated manifestos and leaflets, and published many short and powerful articles exposing the reactionary policies of the Tsarist government and instructing the masses on the tactics and methods of struggle, such as "Workers of the Caucasus, It is Time for Revenge!", "Citizens!", "Proclamation to All Workers!", "Tiflis, November 20, 1905," "Two Fights," "International Counter-Revolution," "The Bourgeoisie is Laying a Trap," "'Factory Legislation' and the Proletarian Struggle," etc. In these articles, Stalin raised the significance of armed struggle, especially armed uprising, to an extremely important position as the main form of struggle of the revolutionary movement at that time.

The "Preface to the First Volume by the Author" published in front of the main text provides a historical explanation of the views on the conditions for the victory of socialism and the issue of land nationalization in this book. Stalin pointed out that in the articles "Anarchism or Socialism" and "The Land Question," there are still traces of the views held by the older generation of Marxists (including the author himself) at that time, which were later corrected.

The "Annotations" and "Chronology" of the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union attached at the end of the book are of important reference value for studying the works in the first volume of "Complete Works of Stalin."

Stalin's writings fifty years ago are profound answers to many important theoretical issues of Marxism-Leninism during the formation and development of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1901-1907), a model of the unity of theory and practice, and a brilliant exposition of the revolutionary theory, ideology, organization, and tactical foundations of the Marxist-Leninist party. Studying these works is of great significance for improving the theoretical level of the Chinese Communist Party.

    斯大林全集中文版第一卷出版
    “斯大林全集”中文版第一卷已由人民出版社出版，自今天起先在北京、天津、太原、归绥、沈阳、哈尔滨、鞍山、大连、长春、乌兰浩特、上海、南京、杭州、济南、福州、武汉、广州、长沙、南昌、重庆、成都、昆明、西安、兰州、迪化等二十五个城市开始发行，其他各地在十一月七日以后开始发行。
    “斯大林全集”第一卷包括斯大林自一九○一年至一九○七年四月的著作，共计三十篇，还有一篇附录。卷首有斯大林自己写的第一卷序言。
    编入“全集”第一卷的文章是斯大林革命活动初期的著作。
    在这时期中，俄国革命运动逐渐高涨，俄国社会民主工党已经形成；一九○三年党的第二次代表大会后，出现了布尔什维克与孟什维克两个派别；其间经过一九○四年的日俄战争和一九○五年的第一次革命，第三次与第四次党代表大会的召开，第一届与第二届国家杜马的召开与解散。
    在这时期中，列宁陆续发表了“做什么？”、
    “进一步，退两步”和“社会民主党在民主革命中的两个策略”等伟大著作，奠定了马克思列宁主义政党的思想、组织和策略的基础。
    在这个时期中，斯大林在南高加索梯弗里斯、巴库、巴土姆、库泰依斯等地建立了列宁火星派即布尔什维克的组织，并领导了这些组织的活动。他亲自组织了许多工人小组，给他们讲课，设立秘密印刷所，创办报纸，写文章，作报告，印发传单，直接领导罢工，组织游行示威。
    在这个时期中，斯大林在他的著作中对各色各样的反马克思主义派别和机会主义派别进行了不调和的斗争，论证了和捍卫了马克思列宁主义学说的基本原则，协助列宁奠定了马克思列宁主义政党的思想、组织和策略的基础。
    列宁的“做什么？”（一九○二年）一书是马克思主义的思想基础，而斯大林的“略论党内意见分歧”（一九○五年）则发挥了和捍卫了这个思想体系，论证了马克思主义政党就是工人运动和社会主义的结合，彻底揭露了机会主义的思想根源，把理论和党的作用提到了应有的高度。
    列宁的“进一步，退两步”（一九○四年）一书奠定了马克思主义政党的组织基础，而斯大林的“无产阶级和无产阶级政党”（一九○五年）则发挥了和捍卫了这一基本的组织原理，阐明了马克思主义党的学说，说明党是无产阶级的领导组织，是无产阶级手中的基本武器，有了这个武器才能使争取无产阶级专政的斗争获得胜利。
    列宁的“社会民主党在民主革命中的两个策略”（一九○五年七月）一书奠定了马克思主义政党的策略基础，而斯大林的“武装起义和我们的策略”（一九○五年七月）和“临时革命政府和社会民主党”（一九○五年八月）二文则发挥了和捍卫了这一基本策略原理，在思想上击破了孟什维克的小资产阶级策略方针，武装了俄国工人阶级去进一步扩展资产阶级民主革命，并指出社会主义革命的明确前途。
    斯大林在一九○六年发表的“无政府主义还是社会主义”这一光辉的马克思列宁主义的经典著作，和列宁的“唯物主义与经验批判主义”（一九○九年）同样起了捍卫马克思主义理论基础的作用。斯大林在“无政府主义还是社会主义”一文中，用通俗简洁的文笔阐明和论证了辩证方法、唯物主义的理论和无产阶级的社会主义，彻底地批判了无政府主义各种反科学的反动思想，指出了资本主义的必然死亡，无产阶级革命的必然胜利。斯大林在指出了未来社会主义社会的远景之后，确定“继资本主义而来的必然是社会主义制度，正像继黑夜而来的必然是白天一样”。差不多在五十年前，斯大林就这样论证了社会主义革命的必然性，确定了布尔什维克党的作用和任务，这个光荣的任务后来终于完成了，斯大林在五十年前所描绘的社会主义社会的远景现在终于实现了。
    编入“斯大林全集”第一卷的共有三十多篇文章。除了前述几篇发挥马克思列宁主义思想、组织、策略、理论基础的经典论著之外，其第一篇为斯大林给他所创办的梯弗里斯社会民主党组织的第一个格鲁吉亚文报纸“斗争报”（一九○一年九月创刊）写的社论“编辑部的话”。他在这一篇纲领性的文章中简略而明确地叙述了当时高加索以及整个俄国革命运动的情况，指出和规定了南高加索工人革命运动的方针和道路，并把它和全俄与全世界的革命运动联系起来。在“俄国社会民主党及其当前任务”（一九○一年十一月）一文里，则把整个科学社会主义的发展过程和工人运动的历史作了非常简明而又全面的叙述。这一著作从人类怎样经过无数苦难而终于科学地研究出和论证了社会主义说起，扼要叙明社会主义怎样从空想到科学，工人运动怎样从自发的无组织的状态转变到自觉的有组织的状态，社会主义思想怎样在俄国和工人运动结合起来，个别工人集团反对个别业主的分散的斗争怎样统一起来，融合为总的阶级斗争。这一著作指出迷惑于遥远的目的而放弃目前的斗争和满足于目前的斗争而不追求最终目的的做法都是错误的，揭露出经济主义者的真面目就是机会主义，阐明社会主义对于工人阶级的意义，证明马克思主义政党在工人阶级斗争中的作用，并进一步具体指出俄国社会民主党的当前任务，——打倒专制制度，争取民主宪法的以政治斗争为主的任务。
    早在一九○一年以前，斯大林就发现列宁是无产阶级革命斗争的最典范的领导者。由于意见分歧，社会民主工党于一九○三年分裂为布尔什维克和孟什维克两个政派时，斯大林立刻站到列宁方面、布尔什维克方面。在两封“库泰依斯来信”（一九○四年）中，斯大林充分表明他是怎样积极地捍卫列宁的立场而反对以普列汉诺夫为首的孟什维克机会主义者。他驳斥了“自发运动本身就会产生社会主义”的谬论之后，把“完全不依赖自发运动”而创造的社会主义理论这一说法称之为“列宁思想”，“我之所以称它为列宁思想，是因为在俄国文坛上没有人像列宁把它说得那样清楚”。斯大林非常尊重列宁，称列宁为高瞻远瞩、坚定不移的
    “真正的山鹰”。他在自己的许多卓越的著作中，捍卫了列宁路线，论证了科学的社会主义理论和社会主义与工人运动的结合。对孟什维克、无政府主义者、民族主义者及其他一切反马克思列宁主义的机会主义者进行了无情的斗争，揭露了他们的荒谬思想和叛卖行为。
    作为当时党的重要政策之一的土地问题，斯大林在“土地问题”、“论土地问题”、“论修改土地纲领”（都是一九○六年的著作）等三篇文章中，作了具体的说明和深刻的阐述。在多民族的俄国成为一个严重问题的民族问题，斯大林在“社会民主党怎样理解民族问题”（一九○四年）一文中阐述了典范的马克思主义的观点。另外在“各民族友爱万岁！”和“告公民书。红旗万岁！”两篇号召性的文章中，除了揭露沙皇政府的恶毒政策外，也明确地提出了党对民族问题的具体主张。
    为保卫党的正确路线和政策，在上述“略论党内意见分歧”，“武装起义和我们的策略”，“临时革命政府和社会民主党”三文中，和在“答社会民主党人报”，“国家杜马和社会民主党的策略”，“论目前形势”，“目前形势和工人党统一代表大会”等文中，斯大林以种种实例，对孟什维克和一切反马克思列宁主义的机会主义者作了尖锐的批判，精辟地阐述了马克思列宁主义的观点，详尽地说明了意见分歧的根源所在和布尔什维克无可辩驳的正确性，使先进工人们认识了党内意见分歧的真实情况和列宁、布尔什维克的正确立场。
    在一九○一年至一九○七年这一时期中，斯大林在南高加索，主要是在梯弗里斯进行革命活动的时候，曾写了好多篇鼓动性很强的宣言传单，发表了好多篇揭露沙皇政府反动政策和指示群众斗争的策略和方法的短而有力的文章，如“高加索的工人们，是复仇的时候了！”、“公民们！”、“告全体工人书！”、“梯弗里斯、一九○五年十一月二十日”、“两次搏斗”、“国际反革命”、“资产阶级在布置圈套”、“‘工厂立法’和无产阶级斗争”等。斯大林在这些文章中把武装斗争，特别是武装起义的意义，提到极重要的地位，作为当时革命运动的主要斗争形式。
    刊在正文前面的“著者第一卷序言”，对本书关于社会主义胜利的条件问题和土地国有问题的观点作了历史的说明。斯大林指出，在“无政府主义还是社会主义”和“土地问题”的几篇文章中，还留有老一辈马克思主义者（包括著者自己在内）当时所持有而后来纠正了的观点的痕迹。
    书末所附苏联共产党中央委员会马克思恩格斯列宁学院的“注释”和“年表”，对于研读“斯大林全集”第一卷的著作，有重要的参考价值。
    斯大林在五十年前所写的著作，是对苏联共产党形成和发展时期（一九○一年至一九○七年）的马克思列宁主义的许多重要理论问题的精辟解答，是理论与实际统一的典范，是马克思列宁主义政党革命理论、思想、组织、策略基础的光辉阐述。研读这些著作对于提高中国共产党的理论水平有很大的意义。
