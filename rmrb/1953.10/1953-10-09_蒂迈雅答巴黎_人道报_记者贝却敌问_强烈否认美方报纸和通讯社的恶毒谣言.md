Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: Pierre Courtade, reporter for "L'Humanité" in Paris, reported from Panmunjom on the 8th: General Timayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, today strongly denied many malicious rumors spread by Western newspapers and news agencies when answering written questions from this reporter. Some of these rumors were said to have come from General Timayya himself.

Below are the questions posed by the reporter and the answers given by General Timayya at noon today at his headquarters.

	Q: Since there are rumors inside and outside the custodial zones that prisoners of war are attempting "mass escapes," are any special measures being taken or considered to prevent such "mass escapes"?
	A: "Of course, that's absolutely certain. We are actively preparing to deal with such emergencies."

	Q: A news agency reported that in the event of a prisoner escape, Indian troops "may stand aside and allow the prisoners to escape." What are your comments on this news?
	A: "It would be ridiculous if the custodial forces adopted such an attitude. We will do everything we can to prevent escapes, and in fact, I am confident that we can prevent mass escapes."

	Q: Does the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission believe that only at the cost of "collective massacres" can such "mass escapes" be prevented?
	A: "This question is difficult to answer. It all depends on the specific circumstances of the escape. In the early stages of a mass escape, we will use the force we deem necessary to stop the prisoners from realizing their intentions. If they continue to do so, we will have to increase the force. As to how far we will continue to increase the force, it will naturally depend on the subsequent actions of the prisoners of war."

	Q: There are reports that members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission are pessimistic about the prospects for the start of the explanation work. Is there any basis for this news?
	A: "As far as we are concerned, we are making every effort to ensure that the explanation work can begin and can be carried out as effectively as possible. I have never heard any member of the committee express any doubt that the explanation work will begin. The Korean and Chinese sides are working to make this work begin as soon as possible."

	Q: American news agencies reported that the Korean and Chinese sides had warned you that they would "disrupt" the explanation work. Is this news true?
	A: "Regarding this news, I can categorically deny it." (Note: United Press International reported on October 7 that this news was released by General Timayya.)

	Q: Has the opinion of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission changed since the adoption of Article 5 of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work"—namely, "Prohibiting any behavior by prisoners of war that obstructs explanation and interview work"?
	A: "The opinion of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has certainly not changed. There has been no discussion on this issue. Of course, no such ruling has been made. (Note: Western news agencies have reported that Timayya said that prisoners of war do not have to attend explanations.) Prisoners of war must of course attend explanations. They have an obligation to attend."

The written questions and answers ended here, but General Timayya expressed surprise at the obstacles encountered by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in arranging the explanation work. He asked: "If not all prisoners of war are given the opportunity to express their wishes, then why send the prisoners of war there? Why establish the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission?"

    蒂迈雅答巴黎“人道报”记者贝却敌问
    强烈否认美方报纸和通讯社的恶毒谣言
    【新华社八日讯】巴黎“人道报”记者贝却敌八日自板门店报道：中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军今天在答复本记者所提的书面问题时，强烈否认西方国家的报纸和通讯社所散布的许多恶意的谣言，其中有些谣言据说是蒂迈雅将军本人说的。
    下面是记者所提的问题以及蒂迈雅将军今天中午在他的总部里所作的答复。
    问：由于看管区内外都有人在扬言战俘企图“集体逃跑”，现在是否正在采取或考虑采取任何特别措施以防止这种“集体逃跑”？
     答：“当然，那是绝对肯定的。我们正在积极准备应付这种紧急情况。”
    问：某通讯社报道说，万一俘虏企图逃跑，印度军队“可能站在一旁，听任俘虏逃跑”，你对这个消息有什么意见？
    答：“如果看管部队采取这种态度，那真是可笑极了。我们将尽一切力量防止逃跑，实际上，我深信我们是能够防止集体逃跑的。”
    问：中立国遣返委员会是否认为只有用“集体屠杀”的代价才能制止这种“集体逃跑”？
    答：“这个问题很难回答。这完全要看逃跑时的具体情况而定。在集体逃跑的初期阶段，我们将使用在我们看来为了制止俘虏实现他们的意图所必需的武力。如果他们继续这样做，我们将不得不增加武力。至于我们要继续增加武力到甚么程度，那自然要看战俘们以后的行动而定。”
    问：有消息说，中立国遣返委员会人员对解释工作开始的前景抱悲观，这个消息有任何根据吗？
    答：“就我们来说，我们正在尽一切努力保证解释工作可以开始，并可以尽可能有效地进行。我从来没有听到委员会委员对解释工作将要开始这件事表示过任何怀疑。朝中方面正在努力促使这种工作尽快开始。”
    问：美国通讯社报道说，朝中方面曾对你警告说，他们将使解释工作“破裂”。这个消息是确实的吗？
    答：“关于这一消息，我可以断然否认。”（按：合众社十月七日电说，这个消息是蒂迈雅将军发表的。）
    问：自从通过“解释和访问工作细则”第五条——即“禁止战俘任何阻碍解释与访问工作的行为”——以来，中立国遣返委员会的意见改变了吗？
    答：“中立国遣返委员会的意见当然没有改变。没有讨论过这个问题。当然没有作过这样的裁决。（按：西方国家的通讯社曾报道说，蒂迈雅曾说，解释时战俘不必出席。）解释时战俘当然必须出席。他们有义务要出席。”
    书面问答到此为止，但是蒂迈雅将军对中立国遣返委员会在安排解释工作方面遇到阻挠表示惊讶。他问道：“如果不让全部战俘有表示愿望的机会，那么为什么把战俘们送到那里呢？为什么要成立中立国遣返委员会呢？”
