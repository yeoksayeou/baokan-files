    The CPC Tianshui Prefectural Committee Holds Autumn Sowing Training Class; Trained Cadres Learn Many Agricultural Production Techniques; Formulate Wheat Production Increase Plan for the Entire Region from Bottom to Top
    [Our Newspaper News] In order to strengthen the Party's specific leadership over the autumn sowing work, the CPC Gansu Province Tianshui Prefectural Committee, taking advantage of the slack farming season before this year's autumn harvest, held a twenty-day autumn sowing training class. The 872 cadres who participated in the training class were mostly village branch secretaries, and some were cadres at the county, district, and village levels, as well as experienced old farmers, model farmers, and mutual aid team leaders. They learned some agricultural knowledge and techniques in the training class. This is an extremely effective measure to help cadres at the county, district, and village levels lead and guide farmers to do a good job in winter wheat sowing.
    The CPC Tianshui Prefectural Committee attached great importance to the work of the training class, assigning three members of the Prefectural Committee to preside over the training work, and hiring technicians from agricultural work stations, soil and water conservation promotion stations, farms, and other units to serve as instructors. The content of the training was: the first fifteen days were devoted to teaching wheat cultivation techniques, such as land preparation, seed selection and seed mixing, wheat sowing, soil and water conservation, fertilizer accumulation and application, pest and disease control, and field management; the last five days were devoted to studying branch work, including how the branch leads production, how the branch secretary leads the branch, and how to conduct ideological and political work among Party members and the masses, with the focus on how the branch leads the good planting of winter wheat. The training method was to teach and learn simultaneously, learn from each other, and summarize experience, so that learning was combined with practice.
    The Tianshui Autumn Sowing Training Class has achieved the following results:
    First, the trainees have initially understood scientific cultivation techniques and the use of various new agricultural implements (this is the main course of the training class). Regarding cultivation techniques, many cadres in the past only shouted to the farmers to "cultivate intensively and meticulously," but did not understand what constituted scientific intensive and meticulous cultivation. Some people thought that the more times the land was tilled, the better. After this training, they understood that the number of tillage times should be determined according to the nature of the land. Because too much tillage would damage the soil's aggregate structure, making the soil loose, which could easily lead to seedling deficiency, drought, and poor seedling development. Those who lacked confidence in repairing terraced fields in the past visited the mountain farm of the soil and water conservation promotion station, tested the ridge and furrow cultivation method and opening horizontal ditches, and saw with their own eyes that the new cultivation method was used to densely plant corn on the mountain terraces. Although it encountered a drought, it grew well (other mountain corn had withered by more than half). Everyone's thinking was straightened out, and they had confidence in repairing terraced fields. Regarding the promotion of new agricultural implements, many cadres felt the most headache in the past. Since liberation, although many new agricultural implements have been loaned out, many farmers have put them aside and not used them. The reason is that farmers have conservative ideas and do not know how to use them; cadres have no way, because they themselves do not know how to use them. This time, they specifically learned how to use new agricultural implements. In addition to general training, the training class also selected 227 trainees from the trainees of each county, and each learned a specialized skill. Some learned how to use the swing seed drill, and some learned how to use the waterwheel. They said, "This time we have the capital to lead production when we go back."
    Second, the experiences of increasing wheat production in various places were summarized and exchanged, and some unscientific cultivation methods were appropriately criticized. Some trainees introduced their local successful experiences and educated all the trainees with practical examples. Some people used to think that seed mixing should use human manure, urine, and cow urine, etc. After this study, they realized that these seed mixing methods would corrode the seeds and hinder the development of wheat seedlings. Zhang Shengming, a labor model from Tianshui County, used a comparative method to introduce his experience in using new plows and old plows, drill sowing and broadcasting, and other cultivation methods, which powerfully explained that his wheat and autumn fields increased their harvest this year because he adopted scientific cultivation methods.
    Third, through this training, a wheat production increase plan for the entire region was formulated from bottom to top, and at the same time, the leading organs grasped the wheat sowing situation in the entire region. This enables trainees and leading organs to formulate realistic production increase tasks and specifically grasp cultivation methods according to the different conditions of different regions. Responsible cadres from each county participating in the training class also helped key villages formulate wheat production increase plans during the study.
    Fourth, the village branch secretaries recognized the tasks and leadership methods of the branch. Although the village branch had played some role in leading agricultural production in the past, the results were not great because many branches did not have a clear understanding of the branch's tasks and lacked experience. In this study, they not only learned a lot of production techniques, but also understood some branch work leadership methods.
    Although the Tianshui Autumn Sowing Training Class did not criticize erroneous ideas and unscientific sowing techniques enough, and the combination of learning and local reality, and the combination of internship and discussion were not close enough, and the training of the branch work item was not fully developed, this training class improved the leadership level of cadres, and will undoubtedly have a good effect on improving rural work, especially this year's autumn sowing work.

    中共天水地委举办秋播训练班受训干部学会不少农业生产技术
    通过训练自下而上地订出全专区小麦增产计划
    【本报讯】中共甘肃省天水地委为了加强党对秋播工作的具体领导，利用今年秋收前的农事空隙，举办了为期二十天的秋播训练班。参加训练班的八百七十二名干部，大部分是乡支部书记，一部分是县、区、乡各级干部以及有经验的老农、丰产模范和互助组长。他们在训练班中学会了一些农业知识和技术。这是帮助县、区、乡各级干部领导和指导农民作好冬麦播种工作的极为有效的措施。
    中共天水地委十分重视训练班的工作，指派地委委员三人主持训练工作，并聘请农业工作站、水土保持推广站、农场等单位的技术人员担任教员。训练的内容为：前十五天传授小麦耕作技术，如整地、选种拌种、小麦播种、水土保持、积肥施肥、防治病虫害、田间管理等；后五天学习支部工作，包括支部怎样领导生产、支部书记怎样领导支部及向党员、群众进行思想政治工作，重点放在支部怎样领导种好冬麦上。训练的方法是边教边学、互教互学、总结经验，使得学习与实际相结合。
    天水秋播训练班已取得了下面的成果：
    第一、学员初步懂得了科学的耕作技术和各种新式农具的使用方法（这是训练班的主要课程）。对于耕作技术，不少干部过去光向农民喊叫“精耕细作”，却不懂得怎样才算是科学的精耕细作。有些人认为耕的次数愈多愈好，经过这次训练，才懂得了要根据土地性质来决定耕地次数。因为耕得太多，反而会破坏土壤的团粒组织，使土壤变松，容易发生缺苗干旱、幼苗发育不良等害处。过去对修理梯田缺乏信心的人，参观了水土保持推广站的山地农场，试验了沟垄耕作法和开横沟，亲眼看到在山地梯田使用新的耕作法实行玉米密植，虽然碰上天旱，却长得好（其他山地玉米已干枯过半），大家思想才搞通了，对修梯田有了信心。对于推广新式农具，很多干部过去最感头痛。解放以来，虽说贷出了不少新式农具，很多农民却把它搁下不用。原因是农民有保守思想，也不会使用；干部也没办法，因为自己也不会使用。这一次，便专门学习了新式农具使用法。训练班除进行一般训练外，并从各县学员中抽训了二百二十七个学员，各学习一门专门技术。有的学会了使用摆耧，有的学会了使用水车。他们说：“这次回去领导生产有本钱了。”
    第二、总结和交流了各地小麦增产的经验，适当地批判了一些不科学的耕作方法。有的学员介绍了当地成功的经验，用实际事例教育了所有学员。有一些人，过去认为拌种要用人粪、尿和牛尿拌种等，经过这次学习，才知道这些拌种法会腐蚀种籽，妨碍麦苗发育。天水县劳动模范张生明，用对比方法介绍他使用新犁和旧犁、耧种和撒播等耕作法的经验，有力地说明了今年他的小麦和秋田增加了收成，是因为采用了科学耕作法。
    第三、通过这次训练，自下而上地订出了全专区小麦增产计划，同时使领导机关掌握了全专区的小麦播种情况。这就使学员和领导机关能够根据不同地区的不同情况，制订切合实际的增产任务及具体掌握耕作方法。各县参加训练班的负责干部，并在学习中帮助重点乡订出小麦增产计划。
    第四、乡支部书记认识了支部的任务和领导方法。过去乡支部在领导农业生产上虽然起了一些作用，但由于不少支部对支部任务的了解不够明确和缺乏经验，成绩不大。在这次学习中，他们不但学到了不少生产技术，而且懂得了一些支部工作领导方法。
    天水秋播训练班虽然对错误思想和不科学的播种技术还批判不够，学习和当地实际的结合、实习和讨论的结合都还不够密切，支部工作一项的训练没有充分展开，但这一训练班提高了干部的领导水平，对于改进农村工作，特别是今年秋播工作，无疑会有良好的作用。
