    Shanghai's Self-Inspection and Supplementary Reporting Work for Industrial and Commercial Businesses Comes to an End
    Relevant Departments are Summarizing Experiences to Prepare for Regular Anti-Tax Evasion Struggles
    The self-inspection and supplementary tax reporting work for private industrial and commercial businesses in Shanghai, which began in mid-August, came to an end at the end of September.
    Through the self-inspection and supplementary tax reporting work, industrial and commercial businesses in Shanghai have generally received a serious education in tax discipline, and their taxpaying attitude is generally more upright than in the past. During the self-inspection and supplementary reporting process, most industrial and commercial businesses conducted self-inspections relatively carefully. Many industrial and commercial businesses admitted their mistakes of continuing to evade taxes after the "Five-Anti" movement, expressed that they would never commit them again in the future, and guaranteed to pay the evaded taxes on schedule. Shanghai's tax officials also received an education in the process of urging and inspecting the self-inspection and supplementary reporting of industrial and commercial businesses. Many people corrected their past feelings of paralysis and complacency, and generally had a further understanding of the consistency of implementing policies and completing tasks. This has laid an ideological foundation for strengthening tax management work and regularly carrying out anti-tax evasion struggles in the future.
    The facts exposed in the self-inspection and supplementary reporting of industrial and commercial businesses in Shanghai show that the situation of tax evasion by industrial and commercial businesses in Shanghai is still quite serious after the "Five-Anti" movement. After inspection, it was proved that the 48 industries with the largest proportion of tax payments in the city, such as dyeing and weaving, silk weaving, machinery, and oils, generally had tax evasion; the amount of tax evaded generally accounted for 8% of the original tax declaration, and some were as high as about 40%. There are many ways to evade taxes, and the circumstances are very serious. The exposure of these tax evasion situations has enabled the Shanghai tax authorities to further understand the tax evasion behavior of private industrial and commercial businesses.
    In the process of self-inspection and supplementary reporting of industrial and commercial businesses in Shanghai, the Shanghai Tax Bureau generally gave lenient treatment to industrial and commercial businesses who had an honest attitude, conducted self-inspection seriously, and were able to recognize their mistakes, without imposing fines or late fees, only ordering them to pay supplementary taxes; however, those tax evasion households who had consistently evaded taxes, had very serious circumstances, and did not conduct self-inspection seriously or even resisted inspection were transferred to the People's Court for severe punishment according to law.
    At present, industrial and commercial businesses in Shanghai that have been found to have tax evasion are paying supplementary taxes; relevant departments are summarizing the experiences and lessons of this self-inspection and supplementary reporting work, preparing to further deepen and regularly carry out anti-tax evasion struggles on the basis of this self-inspection and supplementary reporting work, in order to eliminate tax evasion and ensure national tax revenue.

    上海市工商业户自查补报工作告一段落
    有关方面正总结经验准备经常进行反偷漏税斗争
    上海市私营工商业户偷税漏税自查补报工作，从八月中旬展开以来，到九月底已告一段落。
    经过偷漏税自查补报工作，上海市工商业户比较普遍地受到了一次严肃的纳税纪律的教育，一般都比过去端正了纳税态度。在自查补报过程中，大多数工商业户都比较认真地进行了自查。不少工商业户承认了自己在“五反”运动后仍然偷税漏税的错误，表示今后绝不再犯，并保证如期补交偷漏的税款。上海市税务工作人员在督促和检查工商业户自查补报的过程中，也受到了一次教育。不少人纠正了过去麻痹自满的情绪，一般都对执行政策和完成任务的一致性有了进一步的认识。这为今后加强税收管理工作和经常进行反偷税漏税的斗争打下了思想基础。
    上海市工商业户在自查补报中暴露的事实说明：“五反”运动后，上海市工商业户偷税漏税的情况仍然相当严重。经过检查证明，占全市纳税比重最大的染织、丝织、机械、油脂等四十八个行业，普遍有偷税漏税现象；偷漏的税额，一般占原报税额的百分之八，有些高达百分之四十左右。偷税漏税的方法多种多样，情节十分严重。这些偷税漏税情况的揭发，使上海市税务机关对私营工商业户的偷税漏税行为有了进一步的了解。
    在上海市工商业户自查补报过程中，上海市税务局对于态度老实、认真进行自查、能够认识自己错误的工商业户，一般都予以宽大处理，不罚款，不加滞纳金，仅令其补税；但对一贯偷税漏税、情节十分严重，又不认真进行自查甚至抗拒检查的偷税漏税户，便移送人民法院依法予以严惩。
    目前，上海市已查出来有偷税漏税行为的工商业户，正在补交偷漏的税款；各有关方面正在总结这次工商业户自查补报工作的经验教训，准备在这一自查补报工作的基础上，进一步深入、经常地进行反偷税漏税的斗争，以杜绝偷税漏税，确保国家税收。
