    Further Improve School Work
    The "Izvestia" published an article by Kairov, Minister of Education of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, on September 1st, on improving school work. The abstract is as follows:
    In the new school year of 1953-1954, the basic task of all schools is to further improve the quality of teaching, ensure that students better master basic scientific knowledge, and reduce the phenomenon of grade retention. The preliminary summary of materials from the last school year proves that in many states, border regions, and autonomous republics, there are still students with poor grades, and even an increase in the number of repeaters.
    The difficulties encountered in the development of Soviet schools, and our general inability to overcome these difficulties in most cases, are one of the reasons for the serious shortcomings in teaching work. These difficulties include: the rapid increase in the number of students in grades five to seven and grades eight to ten; the massive promotion of lower grade teachers to teach higher grades due to the implementation of the seven-year universal education system; the lack of proper coherence and connection in the work between junior primary schools and seven-year schools, and between seven-year schools and complete secondary schools; the excessive weight of individual subject matter; the poor quality of some textbooks; and the still far from satisfactory work of individual schools and teachers.
    Overcoming these difficulties depends on our ability and work efficiency, that is, on our own efforts.
    In the new school year, every teacher should increase their sense of responsibility for the quality and results of their teaching work, every principal should have a high degree of responsibility for the quality of work of the school and teachers under their charge, and every national education department should be highly responsible for the state of work in the middle schools of districts, cities, states, border regions, and autonomous republics.
    The Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation, in conjunction with the Academy of Educational Sciences and with the participation of some outstanding teachers, has formulated a number of measures to improve school teaching plans, teaching syllabuses, and teaching materials, and is preparing to greatly improve the quality of teaching subjects such as Russian, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. We have paid special attention to reducing unnecessary teaching materials. All schools have received instructions to eliminate unnecessary materials that are difficult for students to understand from the teaching syllabus and textbooks from this school year onwards. In individual subjects, this reduction has reached 15-20 percent.
    From this school year onwards, foreign language (English, German, French, Spanish) classes in the third and fourth grades of middle school will be cancelled. It has been decided that all secondary schools in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic will begin learning foreign languages from the fifth grade.
    One of the most important tasks in the new school year is to make every effort to improve students' ability to use language and strive to improve Russian language teaching. At present, the Russian language proficiency of most students in schools is still low. Many students, even graduates, still make mistakes in writing and punctuation. It should be especially pointed out that the level of students in individual rural schools and non-Russian schools in speaking and writing Russian is very low. We must insist on striving to improve students' ability to use language in oral and written form.
    When talking about teaching work, we must bear in mind that the improvement of teaching work is inseparable from the work of educating students. Therefore, in the new school year, teachers, principals, and all national education workers should concentrate on the issue of educating students as before. Special attention should be paid to organizing children's work and implementing the instructions on improving the work of Young Pioneer and Communist Youth League organizations in schools. The activities of these organizations are an integral part of the overall system of communist education for our underage generation.

    Party Work in Trade Enterprises
    The "Pravda" published an article by Ka. Papin, Secretary of the District Committee of the Shelpakovsky District of Moscow, on August 4th, on the work of the Party in trade enterprises. The abstract is as follows:
    The task of improving trade urgently requires raising the role of primary Party organizations in the trade sector and improving the level of leadership of Party organizations over the work of enterprises. The Statute of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union adopted by the 19th Party Congress granted Party organizations in the trade sector the right to supervise administrative activities. Since the 19th Party Congress, the work of Party organizations in enterprise departments has become significantly more active, and they have begun to exert more influence on the work of the trade sector.
    The primary Party organizations of trade enterprises play a great role in all aspects. Take the Party organization of the Shelpakovsky Department Store, the largest trade organization in this district, as an example. There are a total of forty-seven Communist Party members here. By exercising the right to supervise administrative work, the Party organization has had a huge impact on the work of the store and the supply of goods to the working people. Party members insisted on striving to eliminate shortcomings in the store's work and took timely measures to deal with every stagnation in trade. All the staff of the department store study the needs of citizens for goods. To this end, two meetings were held in the second quarter with the participation of customers, store staff, and industrial representatives. The types and quality of summer, autumn, and winter shoes and women's coats were discussed at the meeting, and suggestions were made to improve the types of goods. On this basis, the department store made appropriate demands on suppliers and implemented a series of rationalization measures aimed at improving customer service. At the suggestion of the staff, various equipment, goods display racks, selection racks, etc. were added. This equipment made it easier for customers to select goods. As a result, the work of serving customers was improved and the labor of salespeople was reduced.
    The advantage of the work of the Party organization of the Shelpakovsky Department Store lies in its manifestation of creative initiative, its ability to focus attention on the most important issues in the store's work, its in-depth study of production activities, and its ability to complete its tasks on the basis of extensive mass political work. Not only Communist Party members but also many non-Party store staff have improved their political and ideological level and professional skills. All of this is definitely manifested in the work of the store.
    However, it should be pointed out that not all leaders of Party organizations in trade enterprises clearly understand how to supervise administrative economic work in order to effectively improve trade work.
    The so-called right of supervision means that although the Party organization does not interfere in the specific work of the administration, it can and must require the administration to correct mistakes and shortcomings on important and principled issues, and to implement the instructions of the Party and the government in practice. Conducting political work for cadres who serve the vast number of consumers, caring for them, and being with them often in order to carry out daily educational work among them, these issues should become the focus of attention of the Party organization.
    Criticism and self-criticism play a huge role in raising the sense of responsibility of trade workers. The Party organization should create such an environment in the trade sector so that people can bravely and loudly point out the shortcomings in customer service. It is very important for the Party organization to deal with the working people's dissatisfaction with the work of the store in a timely manner, and to carefully study the records in the opinion book every day.
    Since the Party organizations of the trade sector have been given the right to supervise administrative work, the requirements for the Party's district committees have also been raised. In the past, the district committees often did not pay much attention to the work of Party organizations in the trade sector. Recently, the district committees have begun to strengthen their attention to them. In recent months, we have held several meetings of activists of trade workers, two meetings of secretaries of Party organizations in the trade sector, and held training courses for them; in addition, joint meetings of trade union chairmen and training courses for social supervisors were also held.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    进一步提高学校的工作
    “消息报”九月一日刊载了俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社
  会主义共和国教育部部长凯罗夫论改进学校工作的文
  章。摘要如下：
    在一九五三——一九五四年的新学年中，各校的基本任务是进一步提高教学工作质量，保证学生更好地掌握基本科学知识并减少留级现象。上学年材料的初步总结证明在许多州、边疆区和自治共和国中，仍有学生成绩低劣，甚至留级生数目增加的现象。
    在苏维埃学校发展时所遇到的困难，和我们在多数情况下一般地不善于克服这些困难，是造成教学工作中严重缺点的原因之一。这些困难如：五年级到七年级学生和八年级到十年级学生人数的飞速增加；因实行七年普及教育制大量提升低年级教师到高年级讲课；初级小学和七年制学校、七年制学校和完全中学之间，在工作中缺乏应有的衔接和联系；个别学科的教材过重；一些教科书的质量不高，以及个别学校和教师的工作仍远不能令人满意等。
    这些困难的克服，有赖于我们的能力和工作效率，也就是说有赖于我们自己的努力。
    在新学年中，应当使每个教师提高自己对待教学工作的质量和成果的责任感，使每个校长对他所负责的学校和教师的工作质量，使每个国民教育部门对区、市、州、边疆区、自治共和国中学校的工作状况，都具有高度责任感。
    俄罗斯联邦教育部会同教育科学院，并在一部分优秀教师的参加下，已经制定了一些措施，来改进学校教学计划、教学大纲、教材，并准备把像俄文、数学、物理，化学和生物学等科目的讲授质量，大大提高。我们曾特别注意削减不必要的教材。各学校已接到指示于本学年起在教学大纲和教科书方面取消不必要的、为学生所难理解的材料。在个别科目上，这种削减曾达到百分之十五——二十。
    从本学年起，中学三年级和四年级的外国语（英、德、法、西班牙文）课取消。决定所有俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国的中学由五年级起开始学外国文。
    新学年中的一项最重要任务是以全力提高学生运用文字的能力，争取改进俄文教学。目前大部分学校学生的俄文知识水平仍低。很多学生，甚至毕业生，在书写和标点上仍发生错误。应当特别指出的，是个别乡村学校和非俄罗斯学校中的学生在俄文的说和写方面水平很低。我们必须坚持争取提高学生在口语和写作方面运用文字的能力。
    在谈到教学工作时，必须牢记教学工作的改进是和教育学生的工作分不开的。所以在新学年中，教师、校长和所有国民教育工作人员都应像以前一样集中注意于教育学生的问题。应当特别注意于组织儿童的工作，实施有关在学校中改进少先队和青年团组织工作的各项指示，这些组织的活动乃是我国未成年一代共产主义教育总体系中不可分割的一个组成部分。
    党在贸易企业中的工作
    “真理报”八月四日发表了莫斯科市雪尔巴柯夫斯基区党的区委书记卡·帕平论党在贸易企业中的工作的文章。摘要如下：
    改善贸易的任务迫切要求提高贸易部门中基层党组织的作用和提高党组织对企业工作的领导水平。第十九次党代表大会所通过的苏联共产党党章授予贸易部门党组织监督行政活动的权利。自第十九次党代表大会后，企业部门党组织的工作显著地活跃起来，他们开始给贸易部门的工作以更多的影响。
    贸易企业部门的党的基层组织在各方面都起着很大作用。就拿本区最大的贸易机关——雪尔巴柯夫斯基百货商店的党组织为例来说吧，这里共有四十七个共产党员，由于运用了监督行政工作的权利，党组织对商店工作和为劳动人民供应货物的工作发生了巨大的影响。党员们坚持争取消除商店工作中的缺点，及时地采取措施来对待贸易中的每一个停滞现象。百货商店的全体人员都研究着市民对商品的需求。为此在第二季度召开了两次有顾客、商店工作人员和工业代表参加的会议。在会上讨论了夏、秋、冬的鞋子和女外衣的品类和质量问题，并提出了改进商品品类的建议。在这个基础上，百货商店向供售者提出了适当要求，并实行了一系列以改善为顾客服务为目的的合理化措施。在职工的建议下，添置了各种设备、货物陈列架、选货架等等，这些设备使顾客便于挑选货品，结果，改善了为顾客服务的工作，并减轻了售货员的劳动。
    雪尔巴柯夫斯基百货商店的党组织工作的优点在于它表现了创造性的主动精神，能把注意力放到商店工作的最主要的问题上，深入研究生产活动，并在广泛开展群众政治工作的基础上完成自己的任务。不仅是共产党员而且许多非党的商店工作人员都提高了政治思想水平和业务能力。所有这些在商店的工作中都肯定地表现出来。
    但是，应该指出，还不是所有贸易企业中的党组织的领导者都明确应该如何监督行政的经济工作，以便有成效地改善贸易工作。
    所谓监督权就是说党组织虽不干预行政的具体工作，但它可以而且必须在重要和有原则性的问题上要求行政改正错误和缺点，并在实践中完成党和政府的指示。对那些为广大消费者服务的干部进行政治工作，关心他们，和他们经常在一起，以便在他们中间进行日常教育工作，这些问题都应成为党组织注意的中心。
    在提高贸易工作人员的责任感方面，批评与自我批评起着极大的作用。党组织应该在贸易部门中创造这样的环境，使人们都能勇敢地、大声疾呼地指出为顾客服务方面的缺点。非常重要的是要使党组织及时地处理劳动人民对商店工作的不满意见，每天仔细地研究意见簿里的记载。
    由于贸易部门党组织被赋予监督行政工作的权利，对党的区委会的要求也提高了。从前区委会常不大注意贸易部门党组织的工作。近来区委会已开始加强对它们的注意。近几月来，我们已召开了几次贸易工作者积极分子会议，两次贸易部门党组织书记会议，为他们举办了讲习班；此外还举行了工会主席联席会议和社会监督员的讲习班。
