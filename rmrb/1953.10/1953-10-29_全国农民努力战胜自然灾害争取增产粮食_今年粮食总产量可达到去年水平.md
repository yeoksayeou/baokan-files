Xinhua News Agency, October 28th—Thanks to the efforts of farmers across the country to increase grain production under the leadership of the government and to fight against natural disasters, the total national grain output this year, according to preliminary estimates, can be determined to be no lower than the level of 1952, exceeding the average annual output of the three years from 1950 to 1952 by more than 15 percent. The grain output in 1952 was the highest in Chinese history.

From the perspective of production in major regions: the Central-South and Southwest regions have seen more significant increases in production this year compared to last year. Most provinces in East China, the Northwest region, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have also seen slight increases in production compared to last year. Only the Northeast region, the North China region, and Shandong Province have experienced slight reductions in production compared to last year. From the perspective of major grain-producing provinces: Sichuan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Hunan, Henan, Hebei, Anhui, Guangdong, Hubei, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guangxi, which together account for 70 percent of the country's grain output, only Shandong and Hebei experienced reduced production due to disasters this year, while most of the others increased production or maintained last year's output level. In addition, provinces such as Shaanxi, Shanxi, Rehe, Guizhou, Xikang, and Fujian have all increased production compared to last year.

During the autumn harvest, farmers in various places responded to the call of the People's Government and enthusiastically launched a campaign to increase production and economize, reducing grain losses. Farmers in the Northeast, North China, and Northwest regions, under the slogan of "meticulous harvesting and threshing, every grain returns home," harvested and cut as they ripened. Farmers in East China, Central-South, and Southwest regions promptly planted large amounts of late-maturing crops such as buckwheat, beans, and vegetables. In addition, farmers in provinces such as Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Hunan, Fujian, and Guangxi also paid attention to catching harmful animals and birds, protecting grain crops. These measures have ensured the increase in the annual grain harvest.

    全国农民努力战胜自然灾害争取增产粮食
    今年粮食总产量可达到去年水平
    【新华社二十八日讯】由于全国各地农民在政府领导下努力增产粮食，并和自然灾害作斗争，今年全国粮食总产量据初步估计已可确定不低于一九五二年的水平，而比一九五○年到一九五二年三年的平均年产量超过百分之十五。按一九五二年的粮食产量是中国历史上最高的一年。
    从各大区的生产情况来看：中南区、西南区今年都比去年有较显著的增产，华东区的大多数省份、西北区和内蒙古自治区也比去年稍有增产，只有东北区、华北区和山东省比去年略为减产。从主要产粮省份来看：共占全国粮食产量百分之七十的四川、山东、江苏、湖南、河南、河北、安徽、广东、湖北、浙江、江西、广西等十二个省，今年仅山东、河北因灾减产，其余大多比去年增产或保持去年产量水平。此外，陕西、山西、热河、贵州、西康、福建等省都比去年增产。
    各地农民在秋收中响应人民政府号召，热烈地展开了增产节约、减少粮食损耗的运动。东北、华北、西北等地农民在“细收细打、颗粒还家”的口号下，作到熟一片、割一片；华东、中南、西南等地农民及时抢种了大量荞麦、豆子、蔬菜等晚熟作物。此外，山西、陕西、甘肃、青海、新疆、湖南、福建、广西等省农民还注意捕捉害兽、害鸟，保护了粮食作物。这些办法都保证了全年粮食收获量的增加。
