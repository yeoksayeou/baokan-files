The vast majority of the staff in our state-owned industrial and mining enterprises are loyal, honest, and responsible to the Party and the country. Over the past few years, they have correctly implemented the policies of the Party and the People's Government, carried out democratic reforms in enterprises, improved business management methods, and brought into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers and staff. As a result, the work of state-owned industrial and mining enterprises has achieved great success, and the main industrial products have exceeded the highest annual output in our country's history. However, there are also a very small number of staff who are not so loyal and honest; they even conceal errors from the state and falsely report achievements. This is an extremely evil practice and must be eradicated.

There are two types of inaccurate reporting in some state-owned industrial and mining enterprises. One is due to unsound enterprise management institutions and lack of experience, resulting in inaccurate original records and statistics, and unrealistic estimates of technical and economic quotas, so the reports to the higher authorities are not truthful. This should be resolved by strengthening the business learning of enterprise staff, improving production management institutions and production scheduling, and strengthening original records and statistical work. The other is intentionally concealing errors, falsely reporting production achievements, and even fabricating false labor models and false new records. The Jiulonggang Coal Mine of the Huainan Mining Bureau in Anhui Province, which was exposed by the CPC Huainan Municipal Committee and is being dealt with by the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Anhui Provincial Committee and the People's Supervision Committee of the Anhui Provincial People's Government, is a recent example of falsely reporting new national records for collective coal mining efficiency five times under the direction and authorization of the former mine director Xie Nan and other leading cadres. Prior to this, there was the case in the Northeast where the former director of the State-owned Northeast Rubber Factory No. 4, Zhao Jun, deputy director Ding Hongtao, chairman of the trade union Zeng Xianning, and deputy secretary of the general branch of the CPC in the factory, Pan Ju, colluded to falsely report achievements and fraudulently obtained the title of "Advanced Factory," which was exposed and dealt with. In North China, leading cadres of the State-owned Dagu Salt Field under the Changlu Salt Administration falsely reported a salt output of more than 44.5 million catties in order to defraud superior awards and certificates during last year's patriotic production increase and economy campaign. Although people like Xie Nan and Zhao Jun who deliberately engage in fraud are only a tiny minority in our state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, such criminal acts of deceiving the Party and the country cannot be tolerated in our state-owned enterprises.

Comrade Malenkov pointed out: "Any act of deceiving the Party and the state, no matter what form it takes, any attempt to deceive, whether it is concealing the truth or distorting the truth, can only be regarded as an extremely serious crime of harming the Party." All Party and government organs and mass organizations must pay serious attention to this kind of concealment and deception, and educate cadres and the masses to continuously fight against this evil ideological style.

This kind of concealment and deception not only conceals the real situation of the enterprise, making it impossible for the Party and the state to realize correct leadership over the enterprise; but also inevitably damages the prestige of the Party and the People's Government, creating extremely bad influence among the workers and staff. Some workers and staff with unclear understanding will feel that completing the enterprise's production and management plan is not very important and not very serious, but can be achieved by speculation; they will think that the work of all labor models and advanced production units may not be real, so they will not actively improve production technology, improve operating methods, and improve enterprise management. This will make the production and management of state-owned enterprises stagnate, the tasks assigned by the state cannot be well completed, and various waste phenomena and accidents may occur. Among some workers and staff with low awareness, they often follow suit, become accustomed to it, and cover up each other, which is even more harmful to the cause of national economic construction. Therefore, whether from a political or economic point of view, this kind of concealment and deception in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises is extremely harmful to the cause of the Party and the people, and it is absolutely not allowed by Party discipline and state law.

The most important reason why this kind of concealment and deception occurs in our state-owned industrial and mining enterprises is that some enterprise staff have the ideology of departmentalism and trophy-ism, and they place the interests of individuals or their own units above the interests of the Party and the country. When they fail to complete the tasks assigned by the state due to dereliction of duty and irresponsibility in their work, or when they do things badly, they do not deeply examine themselves, actively improve leadership methods and work methods, and improve the enterprise's management work, but attempt to conceal errors in order to show that their work is still done well. There are some people who are even more evil. In order to pursue personal "honor" and "status," they do not hesitate to create scams, fabricate so-called new records, and even use barbaric means of retaliation to force workers and staff to falsely report achievements. Although these two types of people have different manifestations, they are all due to their extremely bad character, seriously stained with the decadent ideological style of the bourgeoisie, attempting to use speculative means to deceive the Party and the state's trust in them, to ask the Party and the state for credit and reward, and to satisfy their shameful individualistic purposes. These people are usually complacent and think that their methods are superb; but they forget that in the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party, any concealment, deception, or other improper behavior towards the Party and the country will eventually be exposed.

Comrade Mao Zedong warned us in his article "Rectify the Party's Style of Work": "All cunning people, people who do not work according to a scientific attitude, who think they are successful, who think they are very clever, are actually the most stupid, and there will be no good results." Because of this, the concealment and deception of some state-owned industrial and mining enterprises has finally been exposed by honest workers and staff.

From here, all revolutionary workers, especially the staff of state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, should learn an extremely beneficial lesson. That is, they must resolutely overcome all individualism and departmentalism, treat work with a loyal and honest attitude, and never intentionally conceal the true situation for the sake of personal gain or the petty interests of their own unit, and even less can they use speculative means to deceive the Party and the state. If shortcomings and errors occur in the work, they should have the courage to admit them and actively work hard to overcome them, rather than hide them. If anyone is not like this, but wants to use deception to cover up the true situation, especially wants to regard the enterprises entrusted to them by the Party and the state as tools for them to defraud honor and status, then they will inevitably embark on the criminal road of deceiving the Party and the state, and eventually there is a danger of political degeneration.

The occurrence of this kind of concealment and deception in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises is also inseparable from the bureaucracy of their superior leading organs, and sometimes even inseparable from the erroneous ideological guidance of these leading organs. These enterprises' superior leading organs not only busy themselves with sitting in the office issuing orders all day long, only paying attention to arranging work, and never going deep into the lower levels to understand the situation and check the work; but also some leading cadres themselves have the idea of being fond of greatness and eager for success, liking to report achievements from below and disliking to report shortcomings from below. When they hear that their affiliated enterprises have new production records and labor models, they rarely send people down to conduct serious inspection and verification, and only rely on a report from the lower level to decide to commend and reward them. This bureaucratic style and the idea of being fond of greatness and eager for success, especially that kind of blind commendation and reward, makes a small number of people with bad character think that there is an opportunity to take advantage of it, and dare to conceal and deceive the Party for a long time; at the same time, it directly or indirectly condones and encourages cadres with departmentalism and trophy-ism.

It should be emphasized that among the enterprise staff who make false reports, most of them did not intentionally deceive the Party and the state from the beginning, but because they valued personal interests, or started from departmentalism, when reporting to the higher authorities, they often exaggerated achievements, reported good news but not bad news, and sometimes even falsely reported production achievements simply because of carelessness in their work. If the work of the superior leading organs is in-depth, this situation is not difficult to discover and correct. But the fact is not like this, some leading organs have trusted their reports, and even blindly commended and rewarded them without verification. This makes those cadres with individualism, departmentalism and trophy-ism mistakenly think that making false reports is not only harmless but also beneficial, so they commit the same mistake again and again, and finally embark on the criminal road of intentionally deceiving the Party and the state.

Therefore, in order to effectively eliminate all concealment and deception, leading organs at all levels of enterprises must resolutely overcome bureaucracy and the idea of being fond of greatness and eager for success, and advocate a work style of going deep into the lower levels, going deep into reality, being conscientious and responsible, and seeking truth from facts. In particular, it is necessary to seriously recognize the adverse consequences of that kind of blind commendation and reward. In the future, whenever new production records and advanced figures appear in enterprises that need to be commended and rewarded, the organs presiding over the award ceremony should not only carefully review the reports from the lower levels, but also send responsible cadres and technically knowledgeable cadres to go deep into the site, especially to go deep into the broad masses of workers to repeatedly inspect and verify.

Among our state workers, there are also some people who do not have a sufficient understanding of the serious harm of this kind of concealment and deception, and mistakenly believe that "making false reports is not an illegal or undisciplined act, nor does it belong to a matter of character, and is not as serious as suppressing criticism, disregarding organization, and resisting leadership." Under the control of this wrong idea, some leading cadres of industrial and mining enterprises, even if someone has reported the act of concealing and deceiving to them, do not deal with it seriously and in a timely manner, but think that "it doesn't matter if you report more or less, it's nothing remarkable," and even mistakenly think that exaggerating achievements "can encourage workers' production enthusiasm and can promote other factories and mines to improve production." It must be emphasized that this is a manifestation of a lack of a sense of responsibility for the cause of the Party and the people, and it also objectively contributes to the bad style of concealment and deception. It should be made clear to all state workers that any intentional deception against the Party and the country is not only a matter of personal character, but also a violation of Party discipline and state law, and should be subject to Party disciplinary action, administrative punishment, and even legal punishment, depending on the severity of the circumstances. After the act of concealing errors and falsely reporting production achievements in some state-owned industrial and mining enterprises was exposed, the local Party inspection departments and the state supervision organs have made serious handling, or are in the process of handling, which is completely correct. In the future, the Party inspection departments and the state procuratorial, supervisory, and judicial organs at all levels should conduct legal education for all state workers and all citizens, so that they understand the importance of abiding by state laws, resolutely fight against all bad styles of concealment and deception, so as to ensure the correct implementation of the national economic construction plan.

The Party organizations in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises have not played a good supervisory role, which is also one of the important reasons why this kind of concealment and deception can occur. In state-owned industrial and mining enterprises that have committed the errors of concealing errors and falsely reporting production achievements, it can almost always be found that the Party organizations there not only generally ignore the ideological education of Party member cadres and turn a blind eye to various bad tendencies, but also the heads of some Party organizations collude with those administrative cadres and trade union cadres who are of bad character or have an improper work style, and jointly deceive the Party and the state. This phenomenon should be resolutely eliminated first. In the future, in order to supervise all state-owned industrial and mining enterprises to conscientiously abide by the policies and laws of the Party and the People's Government, correctly complete the tasks assigned by the state, and overcome and prevent all false phenomena, it is necessary to further strengthen the Party's work in enterprises, mainly the Party's ideological and political education for Party member cadres and the propaganda and education work for the broad masses of workers, and repeatedly and patiently educate Party member cadres and workers to treat work with a loyal and honest attitude, and establish the ideological style that state-owned enterprise workers of a socialist nature should have.

Our Party constantly educates us that we must be absolutely loyal and honest to the cause of the Party and the people, and must not have any concealment or deception; whoever violates this principle will actually harm the interests of the Party and the state. In the planned economic construction that has begun in our country, state-owned industrial and mining enterprises bear extremely important tasks. Therefore, all state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and their superior leading organs should educate their staff to deeply understand the serious harm of concealing errors and falsely reporting achievements, resolutely overcome all non-proletarian ideological styles, and treat the production and management work of state-owned enterprises with loyalty and honesty; at the same time, they should also be good at relying on and mobilizing the broad masses of workers and staff, resolutely fight against all bad tendencies, and ensure the smooth progress of the national construction cause.

    肃清国营工矿企业隐瞒错误谎报成绩的恶劣作风
    我们国营工矿企业的工作人员，绝大多数是对党对国家忠诚老实和认真负责的。几年来，他们正确地执行了党和人民政府的政策，进行了企业的民主改革，改善了企业的经营管理方法，发挥了广大职工群众的积极性和创造性，因而国营工矿企业的工作获得了很大的成绩，主要的工业产品已经超过了我国历史上的最高年产量。但是也有很少数工作人员并不是这样忠诚老实的，他们甚至向国家隐瞒错误，谎报成绩。这是极为恶劣的作风，必须加以肃清。
    部分国营工矿企业报告不真实的现象有两种情况。一种是由于企业管理机构不健全和缺乏经验，以致原始记录和统计不确实，技术经济定额推算估计不合实际，因而对上级的报告不够真实。这应当从加强企业工作人员的业务学习，健全生产管理的机构和生产调度，加强原始记录和统计工作等方面加以解决。另一种则是有意隐瞒错误，谎报生产成绩，甚至凭空制造假劳动模范和假的新纪录。中共安徽省淮南市委所揭发的、并由省委纪律检查委员会和安徽省人民政府人民监察委员会正在处理中的淮南矿务局九龙岗煤矿，在原矿长谢楠等领导干部的主持和授意之下，五次假报全国采煤集体效率新纪录，就是最近的一个例子。在这以前，还有东北揭发和处理了的国营东北橡胶四厂前厂长赵均、副厂长丁洪涛、工会主席曾宪宁和该厂中共总支副书记潘巨等人，合谋假报成绩，骗取“先进工厂”称号；华北揭发和处理了的长芦盐务局所属国营大沽盐场领导干部，在去年爱国主义增产节约竞赛运动中，为了骗取上级的奖金和奖状，虚报盐产量四千四百五十多万斤等。在我们的国营工矿企业中，类似谢楠、赵均等有意弄虚作假的人，虽然只是极少数，但是这种欺骗党和国家的犯罪行为，在我们的国营企业中是绝对不能容许存在的。
    马林科夫同志曾指出：“任何欺骗党和国家的行为，不论采取的是什么方式，任何欺骗的企图，不论是隐瞒真相也好，歪曲真相也好，都只能被认为是极严重的危害党的罪行。”一切党政机关和群众团体必须对这种隐瞒欺骗行为引起严重的注意，教育干部和群众与这种恶劣的思想作风作不断的斗争。
    这种隐瞒欺骗行为，不仅掩盖了企业的真实情况，使得党和国家无法实现对企业的正确领导；而且必然会损害党和人民政府的威信，在职工群众中造成极其不良的影响。有些认识不清的职工，会觉得完成企业的生产和经营计划，并不是很重要的和十分严肃的，而是可以用投机取巧的办法取得的；他们会以为一切劳动模范和先进生产单位的工作也未必是真的，因而不去积极地提高生产技术，改进操作方法，改善企业的经营管理。这样就会使得国营企业的生产和经营管理工作停滞不前，国家交付的任务不能很好完成，各种浪费现象和事故也就可能发生。在部分觉悟不高的职工中，往往还会上行下效，相习成风，互相包庇隐瞒，这对国家经济建设事业的危害性就更大了。因此，无论从政治上和经济上来看，国营工矿企业的这种隐瞒欺骗行为，对党和人民的事业都是极其有害的，这是党的纪律和国家的法律所绝对不能容许的。
    我们的国营工矿企业中所以发生这种隐瞒欺骗行为，最主要的原因是部分企业工作人员存在着本位主义和锦标主义的思想，他们把个人的利益或本单位的利益放在党和国家的利益之上。当他们由于工作中的失职和不负责任，没有完成国家所交付的任务，或者把事情办坏了时，不去深刻检讨自己，积极改进领导方法和工作方法，改善企业的经营管理工作，而是企图隐瞒错误，借以表示他们的工作还是做得好的。有一种人则更为恶劣，他们为了追逐个人的“荣誉”和“地位”，不惜一贯制造骗局，凭空捏造所谓新纪录，甚至用打击报复的横蛮手段，迫使职工跟着他们谎报成绩。这两种人的表现虽然各有不同，然而都是由于他们的品质极其恶劣，严重地沾染了资产阶级腐朽的思想作风，企图用投机取巧的手段来骗取党和国家对他们的信任，向党和国家邀功请赏，满足他们可耻的个人主义的目的。这种人平日还自鸣得意，以为自己的手段高强；但是他们忘记了，在共产党领导下的新中国，任何对党和对国家的隐瞒欺骗或其他不正当的行为，最后都会被揭发出来的。
    毛泽东同志在“整顿党的作风”一文中曾告诫我们：“一切狡猾的人，不照科学态度办事的人，自以为得计，自以为很聪明，其实都是最蠢的，都是没有好结果的。”正因为这样，部分国营工矿企业的隐瞒欺骗行为，终于被正直的职工揭发出来了。
    从这里，一切革命工作人员，特别是国营工矿企业的工作人员，应该得到一个极其有益的教训。那就是必须坚决克服一切个人主义、本位主义的思想，用忠诚老实的态度来对待工作，绝不要为了个人的私利或本单位的小利益，有意掩盖真实情况，更不能用投机取巧的手段来欺骗党和国家。在工作中如果发生了缺点和错误，应该勇于承认，积极努力加以克服，而不是把它隐藏起来。任何人如果不是这样，而是想用欺骗手段掩盖真实情况，特别是想把党和国家委托他们管理的企业，当作自己骗取荣誉和地位的工具，那就必然要走上欺骗党和国家的犯罪道路，最后还有在政治上堕落下去的危险。
    国营工矿企业的这种隐瞒欺骗行为所以发生，还和他们的上级领导机关的官僚主义分不开，有时甚至和这些领导机关的错误思想指导分不开。这些企业的上级领导机关，不仅整天忙于坐在办公室中发号施令，只注意布置工作，从不深入下层了解情况，检查工作；而且有的领导干部本身就有好大喜功的思想，喜欢下面报成绩，不喜欢下面报缺点。一听见他们所属的企业出现了新的生产纪录和劳动模范，很少派人下去进行认真的检查核对，仅凭下级的一纸报告，就决定予以表扬和奖励。这种官僚主义的作风和好大喜功的思想，特别是那种盲目的表扬和奖励，就使得少数品质恶劣的人认为有机可乘，敢于长期对党隐瞒欺骗；同时还直接或间接地纵容和助长了有本位主义和锦标主义思想的干部。
    应该着重指出，在那些作虚假报告的企业工作人员中，多数并不是一开始就有意欺骗党和国家，而是由于他们看重了个人的利益，或者从本位主义出发，在向上级作报告时，往往夸大成绩，报喜不报忧，有时甚至只是因为工作中的粗心大意而谎报了生产成绩。如果上级领导机关的工作深入，这种情况是不难发现和纠正的。但事实不是这样，有些领导机关便轻信了他们的报告，甚至不加核对就盲目地加以表扬和奖励。这就使得那些有个人主义、本位主义和锦标主义的干部错误地以为，做虚假报告不仅无害而且有利，因而一犯再犯，终于走上了有意欺骗党和国家的犯罪道路。
    因此，为了有效地杜绝一切隐瞒欺骗现象，各级企业领导机关必须坚决克服官僚主义和好大喜功的思想，提倡深入下层、深入实际、认真负责和实事求是的工作作风。特别是要严肃地认识到那种盲目表扬奖励的不良后果。今后凡是企业中出现了新的生产纪录和先进人物需要表扬和奖励时，主持授奖的机关不只应认真审核下级的报告，而且还应派负责干部和懂得技术的干部深入现场，特别是深入广大工人群众中去反复地检查核对。
    在我们的国家工作人员中，还有一部分人对这种隐瞒欺骗行为的严重危害性认识不足，错误地以为“作假报告不是什么违法乱纪的行为，也不属于品质问题，不如压制批评、目无组织、对抗领导等问题严重”。在这种错误思想的支配下，有些工矿企业的上级领导干部，虽然有人向他们检举了隐瞒欺骗的行为，也不及时地严肃地予以处理，而是认为“多报少报无所谓，没有什么了不起”，甚至错误地认为夸大成绩“可以鼓励工人生产情绪，可以推动其他厂矿提高生产”。必须着重指出，这是对党和人民的事业缺乏责任心的表现，同样在客观上助长了隐瞒欺骗的恶劣作风。应该向一切国家工作人员说清楚，任何有意的对党和对国家的欺骗，不仅是个人的品质问题，而且是违犯党纪和国法的行为，应视情节的轻重，分别受到党纪处分、行政处分，直至法律处分。在部分国营工矿企业隐瞒错误、谎报生产成绩的行为被揭发后，当地党的检查部门和国家的监察机关已经作了严肃的处理，或正在处理，这是完全正确的。各级党的检查部门和国家的检察、监察和司法机关，今后应对全体国家工作人员和全体国民进行守法教育，使他们懂得遵守国家法律的重要性，坚决和一切隐瞒欺骗的恶劣作风作斗争，以保障国家经济建设计划的正确执行。
    国营工矿企业中的党组织没有很好地发挥监督作用，也是这种隐瞒欺骗行为得以发生的重要原因之一。在犯有隐瞒错误、谎报生产成绩的国营工矿企业中，几乎都可以发现，那里的党组织不仅一般地忽视了对党员干部的思想教育工作，对于各种不良的倾向熟视无睹，而且有的党组织的负责人，和那种品质恶劣或者作风不正的行政干部和工会干部同流合污，共同欺骗党和国家。这种现象更是应该首先坚决消灭的。今后为了监督一切国营工矿企业切实遵守党和人民政府的政策法令，正确地完成国家所交付的任务，克服和防止一切虚假现象，必须进一步加强企业中党的工作，主要是党对于党员干部的思想和政策教育工作以及对广大工人群众的宣传教育工作，反复耐心地教育党员干部和工人群众，要以忠诚老实的态度对待工作，树立起社会主义性质的国营企业工作人员应有的思想作风。
    我们的党经常不断地教育我们，必须对党和人民的事业绝对忠诚老实，不得有任何的隐瞒欺骗；谁如果违犯了这一原则，就会在实际上损害党和国家的利益。在我国已开始的计划经济建设中，国营工矿企业担负着极其重大的任务。因此，一切国营工矿企业及其上级领导机关，应教育所属工作人员深刻认识隐瞒错误谎报成绩的严重危害性，坚决克服一切非无产阶级的思想作风，忠诚老实地对待国家企业的生产和管理工作；同时还应善于依靠和发动广大职工群众，坚决和一切不良倾向作斗争，保证国家建设事业的顺利进行。
