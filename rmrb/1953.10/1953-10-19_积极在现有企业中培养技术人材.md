Actively cultivating technical talent is an important task in the nation's construction endeavors. In the past, China's industry was backward, its technical strength was weak, and its technical level was very low. Since the nationwide liberation, the Party and the government, as well as enterprise management authorities, have made great efforts to actively cultivate a batch of new technical talent in schools and enterprises, correctly implemented the policy of uniting, educating, and reforming old technical personnel, and brought into play the role of technical personnel, which has improved the ideological and technical level of technical personnel to a certain extent. These measures have played a significant role in the restoration of China's economy. However, compared with the needs of the nation's planned construction work, technical talent is still insufficient, and the technical level is still low. Quickly and effectively cultivating technical talent remains an extremely urgent task in the nation's construction endeavors.

There are two main sources of technical talent. One is cultivation in schools, where specialized training is conducted in colleges, universities, or secondary technical schools according to the needs of national construction and in proportion. This is a major source of technical talent. However, the expansion of regular schools is limited, and the training period is long, while the number of technical talent needed by the country is large and the time is pressing. Relying solely on regular schools cannot solve all the problems. Therefore, it is necessary to actively cultivate them in existing enterprises. This is another important source of technical talent. To change the situation of insufficient technical talent, we must simultaneously pay attention to the above two sources and not neglect either.

It is not only necessary but also entirely possible to cultivate and improve technical cadres in existing enterprises. The experience of the Design Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry that we are publishing today fully proves this point. In just two years, they brought 235 trainees up to the level of probationary technicians, 91 probationary technicians up to the level of technicians, promoted four technicians to assistant engineers, and two associate engineers to engineers. In addition, they have trained more than 500 new technical cadres from training courses and crash courses, supplementing the design personnel in water and heating, electrical lighting, and engineering geology that were lacking in the past. They have completed the increasingly heavy design tasks year by year, and the state of insufficient design strength and low design level has been initially changed.

The Design Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry has adopted a positive attitude towards cultivating and improving technical cadres in its own enterprise and has used correct methods. That is, relying on Soviet experts and learning from Soviet experience; cultivating young technical cadres and uniting and leading old technical personnel; and cultivating and training new technical forces by subject according to needs.

The Design Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry does not treat Soviet experts in the same way as some enterprises, where they only seek their help to solve problems piecemeal and incidentally; instead, they systematically learn skills from Soviet experts. They do not limit learning from the Soviet Union to general appeals; instead, they carry out concrete leadership and meticulous organizational work. Nor, like some units, do they use the excuse that their unit has no experts to help with the work and fail to actively organize cadres and personnel to learn from advanced Soviet experience; instead, they use every possible opportunity to learn from the Soviet Union and are not satisfied with only learning from the Soviet experts in their own unit. More importantly, they attach importance to ideological work, can connect it with practical work, and carry out criticism and self-criticism on technical ideas, criticizing erroneous bourgeois design ideas, thereby clearing the way for learning advanced Soviet design ideas and technical experience, and truly creating a conscious upsurge in learning from the Soviet Union in the enterprise. Therefore, they have grasped the most favorable conditions and the most effective methods for improving technology, enabling cadres and personnel to master advanced technology in a relatively short period of time.

The Design Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry has focused on cultivating and improving technical strength in young technical cadres, correcting the practice of simply relying on old technical personnel. Their training method is to organize young technical cadres to directly learn from Soviet experts, learn in practical work, and continuously improve their technical and business leadership capabilities by summarizing their work. This approach is correct and has achieved good results. Of course, we should respect old technical personnel and organize people to learn from them; strengthening the unity of new and old technical personnel is still a principle we must adhere to. However, because young technical personnel are energetic and accept new technologies and new experiences more quickly and thoroughly, especially in terms of quantity, young technical cadres account for the largest proportion of our technical personnel team at present. Therefore, we must pay close attention to the work of cultivating and improving young technical personnel. Moreover, as the technical level and business capabilities of young technical personnel continue to improve, they promote the progress of old technical personnel, which creates conditions for us to further unite and transform old technical personnel. The experience of the Design Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry also proves this point. The Design Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry also used crash methods to train professional and technical personnel who were most lacking in the work. This approach, which focuses on learning a professional technology in the fastest possible time and concentrates its efforts to solve the most urgent needs, has important practical significance in the current situation where various technical forces are extremely unbalanced and urgent construction tasks require a quick solution to this problem. Although this approach has its shortcomings, and the personnel trained lack more comprehensive knowledge, it can be remedied by continuing to learn in practical work. At present, some enterprises have also held some training courses in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient personnel, but many of them either take too long to study or the content is too general, rather than focusing on cultivating according to the most needed aspects. This approach needs to be improved. The experience of the Design Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry in cultivating and training technical cadres is not only applicable to design units, but also to other technical units; not only suitable for industrial departments, but also for other departments, which is also very obvious. However, it must be pointed out that there are still few of our enterprises and enterprise leading organs that can attach importance to cultivating and improving technical cadres in existing enterprises and achieve results like the Design Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry. Many enterprises and enterprise leading organs have not paid enough attention to this important work. They have a wrong idea in their minds, believing that cultivating new technical cadres is the business of educational institutions, and as for cultivating and improving existing cadres, it is not their task, or only an incidental task. These units are still accustomed to reaching out to the party's organization departments and the government's personnel departments for cadres; some units even attribute their failure to do their work well to the lack of technical cadres, complaining that the organization departments and personnel departments have not assigned them enough cadres. As a result, their work often lags behind the needs, and the problems of insufficient technical strength and low technical level are never solved. These enterprises and leading organs should learn from the experience of the Design Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry. We believe that with Soviet experts who are enthusiastic about helping our country's construction, with the Soviet Union's rich advanced experience, with thousands of young people full of vigor and a desire for knowledge, and with old technical personnel who have relatively rich work experience and are constantly improving, as long as our enterprise leading organs have the correct attitude towards cultivating and training technical cadres and have the correct methods, we can completely overcome the difficulty of insufficient technical strength step by step.

### 积极在现有企业中培养技术人材

    积极在现有企业中培养技术人材
    在国家的建设事业中，积极培养技术人材是一项重要的工作。过去我国工业落后，技术力量薄弱，技术水平很低。全国解放后，党和政府及企业管理机关曾尽了很大的努力，在学校和企业中积极培养了一批新的技术人材，正确地实行了团结、教育、改造旧技术人员的政策，发挥了技术人员的作用，在一定程度上提高了技术人员的思想水平和技术水平。这些措施，对我国经济的恢复起了很大的作用。但是，和国家有计划的建设工作的需要相比较，技术人材仍然不足，技术水平也还很低。迅速地和有效地培养技术人材，仍然是国家建设事业中一项极为迫切的任务。
    技术人材的来源，最主要的有两个方面。一个是从学校中培养，在高等学校或中等技术学校中，按照国家建设的需要，按比例地分科培养，这是技术人材的一大来源。但是，正规学校的扩展有一定限度，培养时间较长，而国家需要的技术人材则数量很大，时间紧迫，仅仅靠正规学校不能解决全部问题。因此，还必须从现有企业中积极培养。这是技术人材的另一个重要来源。要改变技术人材不足的状况，我们必须同时重视上述两方面的来源，不可偏废。
    在现有企业中培养和提高技术干部不仅有必要，而且完全有可能。今天我们发表的中央重工业部设计公司的经验，完全证明了这一点。他们在短短的两年中，使二百三十五名练习生达到见习技术员的水平，使九十一名见习技术员达到技术员的水平，有四名技术员提为助理工程师，两名副工程师提为工程师。此外，还从训练班和速成学校里培养了五百多名新的技术干部，补充了过去所缺乏的水道暖气、电气照明方面的设计人员和工程地质人员，完成了逐年加重的设计任务，使设计力量不足、设计水平低下的状态得到初步改变。
    重工业部设计公司对在本企业中培养和提高技术干部，采取了积极的态度，而且运用了正确的方法。这就是依靠苏联专家，学习苏联经验；培养青年技术干部，团结和带动老的技术人员，按照需要分科培养和训练新的技术力量。
    重工业部设计公司对待苏联专家，不是像某些企业那样，只是零碎地和枝节地碰到问题时才去找他们帮忙解决；而是系统地向苏联专家学本领。不是只把学习苏联停留在一般号召上；而是进行了具体的领导和细致的组织工作。也不像某些单位那样，以本单位没有专家帮助工作为藉口，就不积极组织干部人员去学习苏联先进经验；而是利用一切可能的机会去学习苏联，并不满足于只向本单位的苏联专家学习。更重要的是，他们重视思想工作，能联系实际工作，在技术思想上展开批评和自我批评，批判错误的资产阶级设计思想，从而为学习苏联的先进设计思想和技术经验扫清道路，真正在企业中造成了自觉地学习苏联的热潮。因此，他们就抓住了提高技术的最有利的条件和最有效的方法，使干部人员可能在比较短的时间内掌握先进的技术。
    重工业部设计公司把培养提高技术力量的重点放在青年技术干部方面，改正了单纯依赖老的技术人员的做法。他们训练的方法是组织青年技术干部直接向苏联专家学习，在实际工作中学习，并不断通过总结工作去提高他们的技术与业务领导能力。这种做法是正确的，也收到了很好的效果。当然，我们应该尊重老的技术人员并组织人们向他们学习；加强新老技术人员的团结仍是我们必须坚持的原则。但是，由于青年技术人员富有朝气，接受新的技术和新的经验比较迅速和彻底，特别是在数量上，青年技术干部在目前我们的技术人员队伍中占最大的比重，因此，必须十分注意培养和提高青年技术人员的工作。而且由于青年技术人员的技术水平和业务能力不断提高，推动了老的技术人员的进步，也就给我们进一步团结改造老的技术人员创造了条件。重工业部设计公司的经验，也证明了这一点。重工业部设计公司还用速成的办法，训练了工作中最缺乏的专业技术人员。这种以最快的时间，集中力量学习一门专业技术，以解决当前最迫切的需要的做法，在目前各种技术力量极不平衡、而紧迫的建设任务又要求必须迅速解决这一问题的情况下，具有重要的实际意义。虽然这种做法有它的缺点，培养出来的人员缺乏较全面的知识，但可在实际工作中继续学习予以补救。现在有些企业为了解决人员不足的困难，也举办了一些训练班，但其中有很多不是学习的时间拖得太长，就是学的内容过于一般化，而不是根据最需要的方面有重点地去培养，这种做法是需要改进的。重工业部设计公司培养训练技术干部的经验，不仅适用于设计单位，也适用于其它技术单位；不仅适合于工业部门，而且也适合于其他部门，这也是很明显的。但是必须指出，我们的企业和企业的领导机关，能像重工业部设计公司那样重视在现有企业中培养提高技术干部并获得成绩的，还为数不多。有不少企业和企业的领导机关，对于这样重要的工作还没有足够注意。他们在思想上存在着一个错误的观念，认为培养新的技术干部是教育机关的事，至于培养提高现有的干部，并不是他们的任务，或只是捎带的任务。这些单位仍然习惯于伸手向党的组织部门和政府的人事部门要干部；有的单位甚至把工作做不好推之于技术干部不够，埋怨组织部门和人事部门没有给他们分配足够的干部，其结果是他们的工作常常落在需要的后面，技术力量不足和技术水平低下的问题始终得不到解决。这些企业和领导机关，应从重工业部设计公司的经验中得到教育。我们相信，有热忱帮助我国建设的苏联专家，有苏联丰富的先进经验，有成千上万充满朝气和求知欲望的青年，又有比较有工作经验并且正在不断进步的老的技术人员，只要我们的企业领导机关对培养训练技术干部有正确的态度，并且有正确的方法，我们完全可以逐步克服技术力量不足的困难。
