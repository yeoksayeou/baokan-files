The increase production and practice economy movement is rapidly unfolding in factories and mines in Northeast, North, Northwest, East, Central South, and Southwest China. The Northeast region took action earlier, and most factories and mines have launched increase production and practice economy competitions. For example, in Shenyang City, among the 182 factories in the machinery, metallurgy, chemical, light industry, textile, municipal, and local industrial systems, 157 factories had launched competitions by the end of September, accounting for more than 86% of the total. Tens of thousands of basic construction workers in the city also participated in the competition. After mass discussions, the increase production and practice economy plans of many factories and mines in Northeast China greatly exceeded the original planned targets. For example, according to statistics from only ten units such as the Anshan Iron and Steel Works, the small rolling mill, etc., the increase production and practice economy will amount to 844.4 billion yuan, which is equal to the total plan of the original 23 factories. Many factories that originally estimated that they could not complete the task and requested a reduction in production no longer requested a reduction. For example, the Dalian Electric Motor Factory originally planned to apply for a reduction of 1,000 electric motors. The Dalian Steel Plant and the Crane Machinery Plant were not very confident in completing the task, but after launching the increase production and practice economy competition, they not only wanted to complete the task but also wanted to increase production. The increase production and practice economy movement in the North China region began in early September. By the end of September, the leadership of each factory and mine had formulated increase production and practice economy plans based on the original production plans, and most factories and mines had group plans. Many factory and mine groups and workshops began to launch competitions. Beijing, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, and other places also organized competitions for the same type of work and competitions between factories. The increase production and practice economy movement in Northwest, East, Central South, and Southwest China is being carried out in-depth at the grassroots factories and mines, and the working groups sent down have started their work. Many factories and mines have mobilized the masses to discuss the plans, compiled specific operation plans, and launched increase production and practice economy competitions. The competition plans for each workshop, work section, and group of the state-owned New Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant have been formulated, and the championship red flag has been issued to the workshops. All employees of the factory are facing the red flag, racking their brains to find ways to solve the problems of weak links. The Hankou Municipal Textile Trade Union recently held a forum for labor model representatives and advanced group leaders to summarize and exchange advanced production experiences. Chongqing No. 101 Steel Plant decided to further strengthen plan management, and each workshop put forward specific increase production and practice economy requirements.

During the increase production and practice economy competitions in various factories and mines, many labor models, advanced producers, and the broad masses of employees have played an active role, and new records and new creations have emerged continuously, which has promoted the completion of the September production plan. Meng Tai, a labor model from Anshan City, invited technicians to his dormitory during the holidays to study the plan and proposed to increase production and practice economy by 40 billion yuan in four months. Guo Hanchun, a labor model from Anshan City who was recuperating, immediately returned to the iron-smelting plant after hearing about the increase production and practice economy competition and organized the employees of the repair shop to formulate a plan to increase production and practice economy by 50 billion yuan. The employees of the electric furnace steelmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Taiyuan Cement Plant, and other six factories and mines continuously created 21 new records of various types in the second half of September. The employees of Yumen Mining Bureau, Northwest Mining Machinery Repair Factory, Factory 603, and Huafeng Flour Mill put forward a total of 555 rationalization proposals in September, of which 373 have been adopted.

At present, the development of the increase production and practice economy movement in various regions is still very uneven. For example, among the 242 factories in western Liaoning Province, only five or six units, such as the Chemical Plant, had their increase production and practice economy plans meet with the workers by September 25th, and most of the factory workers had not yet been mobilized. In the North China region, key factories are better, general factories are worse; state-owned factories are better, and local state-owned factories are worse; large factories are better, and small factories are worse. The following shortcomings still exist in the increase production and practice economy competitions in various factories and mines in Northeast China and need to be overcome: First, mechanically applying the methods and steps of last year's layer-by-layer action, making it impossible for the movement to develop rapidly. For example, most factories in Liaoyang City were still training cadres by the end of September, and some factories in eastern Liaoning Province spent a long time studying documents. Second, disconnected from improving enterprise management. For example, Songjiang Pharmaceutical Factory did not engage in increase production and practice economy because it was engaged in plan management. Changchun No. 8 Rubber Factory neglected the leadership of production due to engaging in increase production and practice economy, which affected the completion of production tasks. Third, some grassroots trade union cadres in factories and mines did not pay enough attention to the increase production and practice economy movement and did not take active action. For example, the entire Changchun Coal Gas Plant was discussing the increase production and practice economy plan, but the six cadres of the trade union who were separated from production were still sorting out labor protection cards. Fourth, some factory and mine plans are not practical. For example, the 11 factories in Anda County, Heilongjiang Province, did not formulate plans based on the specific conditions of their factories, but averaged the increase of 20% of the original production and financial plans as the increase production and practice economy target. Fifth, the number of accidents has increased. From September 1st to 19th, 32 personal injury accidents occurred in Fushun Laohutai Mine. In the third workshop of Changchun No. 8 Rubber Factory, the number of workers who violated operating procedures increased by 10% compared with before the competition. In the process of promoting the increase production and practice economy movement in various factories and mines in Northwest China, it was also found that there were problems of working superficially and abnormal phenomena. First, some unit cadres have insufficient understanding of the increase production and practice economy movement, treating it as a matter for a few people or certain departments and offices. Second, since the launch of the increase production and practice economy movement, achievements have been seen in terms of output, but there has been no improvement in product quality, and there is a tendency to neglect quality. For example, the gasoline refining rate of Yumen Mining Bureau suddenly decreased in the first half of September. Third, the overlapping of individual departments, the multiple leadership, and the time-consuming accounting of the leadership meant that the increase production and practice economy tasks had not yet been issued by the beginning of October. Fourth, in the increase production and practice economy, individual factories and mines have seen a phenomenon of disregarding the overall situation in order to show the achievements of their units.

    各地厂矿增产节约运动迅速开展
    东北、华北、西北、华东、中南、西南等地厂矿增产节约运动正迅速展开。东北地区行动较早，大部分厂矿已展开增产节约竞赛，如沈阳市的机械、冶炼、化学、轻工、纺织、市政、地方工业等七个产业系统一百八十二个工厂中，到九月下旬开展竞赛的已有一百五十七个厂，占总数的百分之八十六以上。全市几万名基本建设工人也参加了竞赛。东北许多厂矿增产节约计划经群众讨论后，都大大超过了原订的计划指标。如鞍山市仅据炼铁厂、小型轧钢厂等十个单位统计，就将增产节约八千四百四十四亿元，等于原二十三个厂的计划的总数。好多原来估计完不成任务，要求减产的工厂，也不再要求减产了。如大连的电机厂，原定呈请减产电机一千台，大连钢厂、起重机器厂原来对完成任务信心不大，但在开展增产节约竞赛后，他们不仅要完成任务，而且还要增产。华北区增产节约运动开始于九月上旬，到九月底，各厂矿领导方面已在原有生产计划基础上订出了增产节约计划，多数厂矿有了小组计划。许多厂矿小组、车间之间开始展开竞赛。北京、唐山、石家庄等地，还组织了同工种竞赛和厂与厂之间的竞赛。西北、华东、中南、西南增产节约运动正在基层厂矿深入进行，派下去的工作组已展开工作。许多厂矿都发动群众讨论了计划，并编制了具体作业计划，展开增产节约竞赛。国营新沪钢铁厂各车间、工段、小组的竞赛计划已经订好，冠军红旗已经发到车间；全厂职工面对红旗，都围绕如何解决薄弱环节问题，动脑筋找窍门。汉口市纺织工会最近召开了劳动模范代表及先进小组长座谈会，总结并交流了先进生产经验。重庆一○一钢铁厂决定进一步加强计划管理，各车间都提出了具体的增产节约要求。
    在各厂矿增产节约竞赛中，许多劳动模范、先进生产者及广大职工群众发挥了积极性，新纪录、新创造不断涌现出来，对完成九月份生产计划起了推动作用。鞍山市劳动模范孟泰，在假日请技术员到宿舍研究计划，提出在四个月内增产节约四十亿元。在休养中的鞍山市劳动模范郭汉春，听到要开展增产节约竞赛，马上回到炼铁厂，组织修理厂职工订出增产节约五十亿元的计划。太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部、太原水泥厂等六个厂矿职工，在九月下半月连续创造各种新纪录二十一件。玉门矿务局、西北矿山机械修配厂、六○三工厂和华峰面粉厂四个单位的职工，在九月份共提出合理化建议五百五十五件，其中已经采纳了三百七十三件。
    目前各该地区的厂矿增产节约运动发展得还很不平衡。如辽西省二百四十二个工厂中，到九月二十五日，增产节约计划与工人见面的只有化工厂等五、六个单位，大多数厂的职工还未动起来。在华北地区，重点厂较好，一般厂较差；国营厂较好，地方国营厂较差；大厂较好，小厂较差。在东北各厂矿增产节约竞赛中还存在以下缺点需要克服：一、机械地搬用去年的层层行动的方法与步骤，使运动不能迅速开展。如辽阳市大部分厂到九月底还在训练干部，辽东省有些厂用很长时间学习文件。二、和改善企业管理脱节。如松江省制药厂因在搞计划管理就不搞增产节约。长春第八橡胶厂因搞增产节约而忽视了对生产的领导，影响了生产任务的完成。三、有些厂矿工会基层干部对增产节约运动重视不够，没有积极行动起来。如长春煤气厂全厂已在讨论增产节约计划，但工会的六个脱离生产干部还在清理劳保卡片。四、有些厂矿计划不切实际。如黑龙江省安达县十一个工厂，都不是根据本厂具体情况制订计划，而是平均以提高原生产、财务计划的百分之二十作为增产节约的指标。五、事故增多。抚顺老虎台矿九月一日至十九日发生了三十二次人身事故。长春第八橡胶厂三车间，违反操作规程的工人较竞赛前增加了百分之十。在西北各厂矿增产节约运动进展过程中，也发现有工作不深入和不正常的现象。第一，有些单位的干部对增产节约运动认识不足，把它当成某一部分人或某些科、室的事情。第二，增产节约运动开展以来，在产量方面已经看出成绩，但在产品质量上未见好转，且有忽视质量的倾向。如玉门矿务局九月上半月汽油炼率突然降低。第三，个别部门机构重叠，领导多头，领导上核算费时很多，到十月初增产节约任务还没有下达。第四，个别厂矿在增产节约中发生了为表现本单位成绩而不顾全局的现象。
