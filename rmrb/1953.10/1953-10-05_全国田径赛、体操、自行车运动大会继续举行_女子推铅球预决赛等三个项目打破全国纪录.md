National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Games Continue
Three Events, Including Women's Shot Put Preliminaries and Finals, Break National Records

The 1953 National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Games continued on the 4th. The women's shot put preliminaries and finals, the women's 800-meter final, and the men's 1,500-meter final all broke national records.

The women's shot put preliminaries and finals were one of the highlights this afternoon. Sixteen female athletes participated in this competition, including Wang Canhua, the national record holder for women's shot put; and Wu Nongmei, a She ethnic minority woman from Fujian who used to be a shepherdess. All of them were strong and full of spirit. As the competition began, Luo Yunqi from the People's Liberation Army (PLA), participating in the National Games for the first time, attracted attention with her accurate form. In her second throw during the preliminaries, her result exceeded the national record (11.745 meters). As a result of the preliminaries, Luo Yunqi and Li Cheng from the PLA, Wang Canhua and Zhu Shoujiu from East China, Xian Shaomei from North China, and Shi Baozhu from the Northeast qualified for the finals. During the finals, Xian Shaomei first exceeded 11 meters, and Shi Baozhu's result was also beyond 11 meters. However, Luo Yunqi reached 12.19 meters in her second throw, greatly exceeding the national record. The audience cheered and applauded the excellent performance of this PLA athlete. The results of the competition: Luo Yunqi won first place with a score of 12.19 meters; Shi Baozhu won second place with 11.82 meters; Wang Canhua third, and Xian Shaomei fourth. The top two both broke the national record.

The women's 800-meter final was also very competitive. As the starting gun fired, Sun Hongxia from the Railway team took the lead. In the second lap, Wen Liping from the PLA team overtook Sun Hongxia. In the last 50 meters, Zhang Fushun, a female athlete from Inner Mongolia, also passed Sun Hongxia. Wen Liping's time was 2 minutes 33.1 seconds, winning first place; Zhang Fushun took second place with 2 minutes 33.4 seconds; Sun Hongxia took third place with a time of 2 minutes 34 seconds. Zhao Guizhi from the Northeast team and Li Shaofang from the PLA team took fourth and fifth place with 2 minutes 34.1 seconds and 2 minutes 34.2 seconds, respectively. All of these results exceeded the previous highest record of 2 minutes 35 seconds set by Wen Liping at the All-Army Selection Competition this year. When the reporter announced these results to the audience, the entire venue responded with warm applause.

In the men's 400-meter hurdles, Wang Yongan once again created a new record. His time today was 56.8 seconds (the preliminary round was 57 seconds).

In the men's 1,500-meter final, Li Qi from the East China team ran in the lead at the beginning, but in the last 50 meters, Yan Zhangzhao from the PLA team sprinted past Li Qi, winning first place with 4 minutes 7.2 seconds; Li Qi's time was 4 minutes 7.8 seconds; third was Shi Qin from the PLA team, with a time of 4 minutes 8.4 seconds. All three broke the national record of 4 minutes 11.1 seconds. The fourth place was Bai Liangwu from the PLA team.

Also held in the afternoon were the men's 100-meter final, the men's 200-meter preliminaries, the women's 100-meter semi-finals, and the women's vault, among other events. In the men's 100-meter final, Ou Zukang from East China won first place with a time of 11.2 seconds. Huang Xiang from the PLA, Li Yongqing from the Northwest, and Tan Qing from the PLA won second, third, and fourth place, respectively.

In the morning, the Soviet sports delegation once again gave a wonderful performance. The audience watched their outstanding performance with great interest.
