Factory 401 in Liaoxi, in the process of extensively mobilizing the masses to discuss the production increase and economy campaign, not only unified the production increase and economy campaign with the national plan and formulated a new operation plan, paying attention to the balance of production in various workshops, but also paid special attention to the balance of production and sales in the fourth quarter.

In terms of internal factory production, the main problem is that the product quality is low and does not meet national standards, which affects production increase. In order to solve this problem, Factory 401 has formulated specific technical measures to improve quality. For example, in terms of improving the quality of the first product, it has been decided to conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, implement air addition to the furnace wall, increase the furnace temperature, and modify the short walls of the furnace body. These measures are now being used in the No. 1 distillation furnace to conduct experiments to improve quality. At the end of September, a quality record was created, with the lead content reaching 0.0181 percent. The measures to improve quality are being promoted from Furnace No. 1 to all furnaces. There is no problem that the lead content of all furnaces will be reduced to below the national target (0.07 percent lead content) in the fourth quarter. Another problem encountered in the balance plan in terms of production is the problem of equipment turnover. Using the existing equipment, it is necessary to do a good job in this year's production and also to do a good job in the production preparation for next year, so the equipment turnover is not smooth. In this balance plan, the problem of equipment turnover has been solved by strengthening scheduling and the planned maintenance of equipment.

In terms of product sales, the main problems are: in the past three quarters, some products have been partially stockpiled, and the sales channels for the increased production have not yet been found, which requires actively opening up product sales channels and completing the fourth quarter sales plan. Factory 401 has a total of four products. The leadership has determined the sales plan for each product based on the total output for the entire fourth quarter (including the increased production) and the amount of past stockpiles. Now it seems that the sales channels have been opened up. The first product is allocated by the state, and the increased production has been approved by higher authorities. As long as the quality meets the national standards, there is no problem with sales. Although the sales volume of the second product in the fourth quarter exceeds the original promotion plan by more than 80 percent, most of the products have found sales channels, and sales contracts are being signed with users. Only a small part has not been finalized yet. The third product has improved in quality, and many units have written to order it. All the products in the fourth quarter have found sales channels, and sales contracts have been signed. There are problems with the sales channels for the fourth product. After consultation with a manufacturer, the problem has been partially solved, and a portion is still stockpiled for the entire quarter. In this regard, Factory 401 is seizing the time to sign the sales contracts that have not yet been signed and actively promoting the part of the product that has not yet found sales channels.

The fourth quarter plan of Factory 401 has been balanced, and the problems existing in production and sales have been initially solved. This provides a concrete guarantee for the realization of the production increase and economy campaign and avoids the blindness of production increase and economy campaign.

    四○一厂注意解决产、销平衡问题
    辽西四○一厂在广泛发动群众讨论增产节约计划中，除把增产节约计划与国家计划统一起来，制订出新的作业计划，注意到各车间生产的平衡外，还特别注意了第四季度的产、销平衡问题。
    在厂内生产方面，主要的问题是产品质量低，达不到国家标准，影响增产。为了解决这个问题，四○一厂已经制订了提高质量的具体技术措施，如在提高第一种产品质量方面，决定认真贯彻苏联专家的建议，实行炉壁加风，提高炉温，改炉体短墙等。现正运用这些措施在一号蒸馏炉作提高质量的试验。九月末已创造了质量纪录，含铅率达到了百分之零点零一八一。有关提高质量的措施正由一号炉推广到各炉，在第四季度内各炉含铅率全部降到国家指标（含铅百分之零点零七）以下，是没有问题的。平衡计划中，在生产方面遇到的另一个问题是设备周转问题，运用现有设备既要搞好今年的生产，又要搞好明年的生产准备工作，所以设备周转不开。在这次平衡计划中，经过加强调度和设备检修的计划性，设备周转的问题已经得到解决。
    在产品销售方面，主要问题是：过去三个季度，某些产品有部分积压，增产部分的销路还没有着落，这就需要积极打开产品销路，完成第四季度销售计划。四○一厂共有四种产品，领导上根据第四季度全季产量（包括增产部分）和过去积压的数量，确定了每种产品的销售计划。现在看来，销路已经打开，第一种产品由国家调拨，增产部分已经上级机关批准，只要质量达到国家指标，销路没有问题；第二种产品的第四季度销售量，虽然超过原订推销计划百分之八十多，但大部分产品已经找到了销路，现正与用户签订销售合同，所余只一小部分还没作最后肯定；第三种产品由于质量已经提高，很多单位来信订购，第四季度的全部产品已经找到了销路，销售合同已经签订；第四种产品的销路存在问题，经和某厂商量，问题得到部分解决，全季尚积压一部分。在这方面，四○一厂正抓紧签订还没有签订的推销合同，积极推销尚未找到销路的部分产品。
    四○一厂的第四季度计划已经平衡下来，初步解决了产、销中存在的问题，这样就使增产节约的实现得到了具体保证，避免了增产节约的盲目性。
