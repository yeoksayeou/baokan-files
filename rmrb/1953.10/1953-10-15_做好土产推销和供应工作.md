    Do a Good Job in Promoting and Supplying Native Products

    The National Native Products Conference convened by the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government summarized the native product exchanges of the past four years, discussed the future direction and tasks of native product management, conducted internal business exchanges within the native product company system, and studied the native product purchasing and sales plans for the fourth quarter of the year. This is of great significance for doing a good job in promoting and supplying native products in the future.

    Before liberation, the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and their years of anti-people war severely damaged the urban and rural economies. Material exchanges between urban and rural areas and between regions were cut off, and the sales of local and special products were blocked, which seriously affected the lives of the broad masses of peasants. After liberation, the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, in accordance with the policy of "mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, internal and external exchanges," repeatedly instructed to vigorously develop national native product exchanges. Over the past four years, under the specific organization and leadership of local Party committees and people's governments, through trade forms such as native product exhibitions, native product exchange fairs, urban and rural material exchange fairs, and specialized commodity production and sales conferences, production and sales information has been communicated, native product sales have been expanded, commercial routes have been restored, and the urban and rural economy has been enlivened. This has increased the purchasing power of farmers, expanded the market for industrial products, and promoted the development of industrial and agricultural production, thereby further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance economically.

    Regarding the current production and sales situation of native products, on the one hand, due to the impact of large-scale native product exchanges in recent years, with the exception of a very few varieties, they have generally become best-selling, and the sales problem of native products has been basically solved. After the country entered planned economic construction, the urban and industrial and mining population has continued to increase, and the people's purchasing power has gradually improved, and some native product industrial raw materials and non-staple foods have appeared in short supply. On the other hand, due to certain improper measures taken by state-owned commercial departments in the first half of this year, some abnormal situations also exist in the native product market: for example, the growth of urban non-staple food needs was underestimated, and the organization of supply was not paid attention to in time, so there was a phenomenon of supply imbalance, which had some impact on the lives of urban people; the production and sales prices of some native products were not reasonable enough; and the speculative activities of some private merchants in the purchase and sale of native products have adversely affected producers and consumers.

    Under these circumstances, what should be the guiding principle of native product work? The meeting pointed out that national local and special products occupy a very important position in the national economy, and they are closely related to the production and life of the vast agricultural population. In particular, for the people of minority nationalities with a population of more than 40 million and the revolutionary old base areas with a population of more than 100 million and some disaster-stricken areas, the production and promotion of local and special products are of greater significance for their economic recovery and development. Therefore, state-owned commercial departments must take a responsible attitude to organize the supply and sales of local and special products. In addition to strengthening the management of state-owned commerce, people's governments at all levels should, through unified planning, enable state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives to conduct appropriate division of labor, strengthen guidance on the production and sales of native products; and in the spirit of division of labor, cooperation, and close coordination, guide the operation of private merchants through actual business, give play to the legitimate initiative of private commerce, and prevent its destructive speculation. These are the current guiding principles of native product work.

    In implementing the above guidelines, it is necessary to pay attention to mastering the three links of "expanding sales, organizing supply, and guiding production." Experience has proved that native products can only benefit farmers in practice if they are sold. In order to expand sales, it is necessary to strengthen the work of organizing supply. State-owned companies and cooperatives must be closely integrated, support each other, strengthen the allocation and supply of native products according to the needs of urban and rural areas, domestic and foreign, and should appropriately strengthen market management so that the promotion and supply of native products can be better coordinated. At the same time, strengthening production guidance through price policies and avoiding blindness in production is an important task that is conducive to promotion and supply. In the past, there was a phenomenon of native product production and sales being sometimes in short supply and sometimes in oversupply. This phenomenon shows that we are not good enough at using the law of value to regulate native product production. Comrade Stalin said in "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR": "The bad thing is not that the law of value affects our production. The bad thing is that our economic workers and planning workers, with few exceptions, know very little about the role of the law of value, do not study this role, and are not good at considering this role in their own accounting." Therefore, in mastering native product prices, it is necessary to overcome two deviations: one is to not study the characteristics and supply-demand relationship of local and special products, not consider seasonal changes, and mechanically emphasize stabilizing native product prices, which often affects production or the normal supply of the market; the other is to completely let go of the purchase and sale prices of native products, blindly following the rise and fall of free market prices, which often results in producers suffering losses, consumers increasing burdens, and illegal private merchants exclusively obtaining windfall profits. Both of these practices are wrong. In mastering native product prices, the general policy should still be "small profits but quick turnover." However, attention should also be paid to the changes in the production and sales situation of different products and treat them differently. In short, paying attention to the mastery of price policies and strengthening the guidance of native product production and consumption has become an important link in the management of native products in the future. Therefore, we should strengthen the investigation and research of production and sales conditions, pay attention to the mastery of price policies, so as to strengthen production guidance and better serve producers and consumers in the future.

    In order to correctly implement the above policies and tasks, the Ministry of Commerce of the Central Government, after submitting a request to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council for approval, decided to merge the China Tobacco and Hemp Company into the China Native Products Company, which is responsible for leading the business work of native products companies, local trade companies, ethnic trade companies, and tobacco and hemp companies throughout the country. After discussion at this meeting, the tasks of the native product company were determined to be four: (1) the management of tobacco and hemp; (2) the supply of non-staple foods and native product industrial raw materials in large cities and industrial and mining areas; (3) trade work in ethnic minority areas; and (4) general native product purchasing, sales, production guidance, and supply for export. In the long run, according to the direction of urban and rural division of labor, the task of managing general native products in rural areas should be gradually transitioned to cooperatives in order to further organize farmers.

    In order to do a good job in native product work, it is necessary to further emphasize relying on the leadership of local Party committees and governments. Only under the leadership of local Party and government can the initiative and enthusiasm of local areas in native product management be better brought into play, which is conducive to solving the sales problem of numerous and scattered native products; and solving the economic needs of people in different regions. However, in order to reduce blindness in business operations and prevent affecting production or market prices, the central commercial departments must strengthen the leadership of native product business operations based on the national native product production and sales situation and overall commercial policies. Conduct in-depth research on the native product market situation, gradually understand the production and sales relationship, conduct commodity ranking, and reasonably adjust prices to guide the production and exchange of native products.

    The National Native Products Conference has ended. Local commercial administrative departments should, based on the actual local situation and with reference to the decisions and spirit of the National Native Products Conference, make appropriate arrangements for native product work. In future work, on the one hand, attention should be paid to steadily strengthening the management of state-owned native product companies, so that they can assume the responsibilities they should bear. At the same time, attention should also be paid to preventing blind advancement, and the combination of state-owned companies and cooperatives should be strengthened in a practical manner, and the leading role of state-owned commerce should be fully brought into play, so that state-owned commerce can better rely on cooperative commerce and lead private commerce to divide labor and cooperate to jointly complete the task of promoting and supplying native products.

### 做好土产推销和供应工作

    做好土产推销和供应工作
    中央人民政府商业部召开的全国土产会议，简要地总结了四年来土产交流的情况，讨论了今后土产经营的方针和任务，进行了土产公司系统内部的业务交流，研究了各地第四季度土产购销计划。这对今后做好土产推销和供应工作有着重要意义。
    解放前，由于蒋匪帮的反动统治和其连年进行反人民战争的结果，使城乡经济遭到严重破坏，城乡间、地区间的物资交流隔绝，土、特产品销路阻塞，严重地影响了广大农民的生活。解放后，中国共产党和中央人民政府根据“城乡互助、内外交流”的政策，曾一再指示大力开展全国土产交流。过去四年来，在各地党委和人民政府的具体组织和领导下，通过土产展览会、土产交流会、城乡物资交流会、专业商品产销会议等等贸易形式，沟通了产销情况，扩大了土产推销，恢复了商业路线，活跃了城乡经济，从而提高了农民购买力，扩大了工业品市场，促进了工农业生产的发展，从经济上进一步巩固了工农联盟。
    目前土产的产销情况，一方面由于几年来大规模开展土产交流的影响，除极少数的品种以外，一般地转为畅销，基本上解决了土产的销路问题；在国家进入计划经济建设之后，城市及工矿区人口不断增加，人民购买力逐步提高，部分土产工业原料和副食品出现了供不应求的情况。另一方面，由于今年上半年国营商业部门某些措施失当，因而在土产市场上也存在着某些不正常的情况：如对城市副食品需要增长的情况估计不足，组织供应未及时引起注意，因此有供应失调现象，对城市人民的生活有所影响；某些土产产销价格不够合理；某些私商在土产购销中的投机倒把行为，都使生产者和消费者遭受不利的影响。
    在此情况下，土产工作的方针应该是怎样的呢？这次会议上已经指出，全国土、特产在国民经济中占有很重要的地位，它密切关联到广大农业人口的生产和生活问题。特别是人口在四千万以上的少数民族和一亿以上的革命老根据地及某些受灾地区的人民，土、特产的生产和推销，对他们的经济恢复和发展更有其重要的意义。因此，国营商业部门必须采取负责态度组织土、特产品的供销工作。除国营商业加强经营外，各级人民政府应经过统一的计划，使国营商业和供销合作社进行适当分工，加强土产产销的指导；并在分工合作、密切配合的精神下，通过实际业务来领导私商经营，发挥私营商业的正当的积极性，防止其投机倒把的破坏性。这些就是当前土产工作的方针。
    在执行以上方针时，必须注意掌握“扩大推销、组织供应、指导生产”的三个环节。经验证明，土产只有销出去才能使农民在实际上获得利益。为了扩大推销，必须加强组织供应方面的工作。国营公司、合作社必须密切结合，相互支持，根据城乡、内外的需要情况，加强土产的调拨供应工作，并应适当地加强市场管理工作，使土产的推销和供应工作更好地配合起来。同时，通过价格政策，加强生产指导，避免生产上的盲目性，是有利于推销和供应的重要工作。过去土产的产销存在着时而畅销时而滞销的现象。这种现象说明我们在利用价值法则调节土产生产上是不够的。斯大林同志在“苏联社会主义经济问题”中说：“糟糕的并不是价值法则影响我国的生产。糟糕的是我们的经济工作人员和计划工作人员，除了少数的例外，对于价值法则所发生的作用知道得很差，不研究这种作用，不善于在自己的核算中考虑这种作用。”因此在土产价格掌握上必须克服两种偏向：一是不研究土、特产的特点和供求关系，不考虑季节变化，而机械地强调稳定土产价格，其结果往往影响生产或市场的正常供应；一是对土产购销价格完全放任自流，盲目地跟着自由市场价格涨落而涨落，其结果往往是生产者受损失，消费者增加负担，而不法私商独获暴利。这两种做法都是不对的。在土产价格的掌握上，总的还应该采取“薄利广销”的政策。但同时也应注意不同产品产销情况的变化，分别对待。总之，重视价格政策的掌握，加强土产生产和消费的指导，已成为今后土产经营工作中的重要环节。所以，今后应该加强产销情况的调查研究，注意价格政策的掌握，以便加强生产指导，更好地来为生产者和消费者服务。
    为了正确执行以上的方针和任务，中央商业部经呈请政务院财政经济委员会批准，决定以中国烟麻公司为基础合并成立中国土产公司，负责领导全国各地土产公司、地方贸易公司、民族贸易公司和烟麻公司的业务工作。经过这次会议的讨论，确定了土产公司的任务有四：（一）烟麻的经营；（二）大城市工矿区副食品及土产工业原料的供应；（三）少数民族地区的贸易工作；（四）一般的土产购销和生产指导及供应出口工作。从长远来看，根据城乡分工的方向，农村一般土产的经营任务应逐步过渡到由合作社去担负，以便进一步将农民组织起来。
    为要做好土产工作，必须更强调依靠地方党和政府的领导。只有在地方党政领导之下，才能更好地发挥地方上对土产经营的主动性和积极性，便利于解决数量众多、生产分散的土产销路；解决不同地区的人民经济要求。但为了减少业务经营上的盲目性和防止影响生产或市场物价起见，中央商业部门必须根据全国土产产销情况及总的商业政策，加强土产业务经营的领导。深入研究土产市场情况，逐步摸清产销关系，进行商品排队，合理调整价格，以指导土产的生产和交流。
    全国土产会议已经结束了，各地商业行政部门，应根据当地实际情况，参照全国土产会议的决定和精神，把土产工作加以适当安排。在今后工作中一方面应注意稳步加强国营土产公司的经营，使其担当应负的任务，同时还应注意防止盲目冒进，并切实加强国营公司和合作社的结合，充分发挥国营商业的领导作用，使国营商业能更好地依靠合作社商业和领导私营商业，分工合作，共同完成土产推销和供应的任务。
