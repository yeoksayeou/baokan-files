    "There's Nothing to Save?"
    Dong Shu
    In Bei Yu Nu Village, Tenth District, Weibin County, Chang'an, Shaanxi, bumper harvest campaigns have been carried out every year, and income has increased year by year. The poor days of "half a year of bran and vegetables, half a year of grain" are over. Nowadays, whether it's neighbors or relatives, when you open the pot, there's more dry food than watery food; when you take out steamed buns, there's more white flour than dark flour; when you serve rice, there's more refined grain than coarse grain. Precisely because of this, some farmers have become extravagant. They don't grind the flour completely, they scatter rice and flour carelessly, the granary is damp, and rats are rampant… They don't care about these "small things" at all. Su Yanhu, the village party branch secretary, paid attention to these "small things" everywhere in the village. One day, Dan Mingzhi was unloading the millstone. He saw that the bran was not clean and tested it with his hand. There was still a layer of white flour on the bran. If it were ground two more times, at least one and a half jin of flour could be ground from one dou of wheat. Su Yanhu asked him why he didn't grind it clean. Dan Mingzhi smiled and said, "People eat, and livestock also eat. If it's ground so clean, what will the livestock eat!" Su Yanhu thought for a while and said, "Whether there's feed or not, check all corners. Whether the livestock are fed well or not mainly depends on a balanced diet of water and grass." Then, he explained the principles of saving grain to Dan Mingzhi. However, Dan Mingzhi didn't listen and even ridiculed Su Yanhu for being too "stingy." He said, "Everyone in the village grinds like this; it's not just me!" Su Yanhu counted on his fingers: Bei Yu Nu Village has 270 people, each person eats two dou a month, the whole village eats 54 dan (large stone), and each dou that is ground cleanly can yield an extra one and a half jin of flour, which means an extra 810 jin of flour per month. After Su Yanhu said this, Dan Mingzhi stuck out his tongue and said, "Calculated like that, it really is a lot!" Saying that, he ground it two more times. This detailed calculation spread, and the next day, Duan Shiqi and other households ground their flour very cleanly.

    Another day, Su Yanhu walked into the home of a woman named Zhang Xiuying and saw her pouring two bowls of leftover rice into the animal trough. Su Yanhu thought: Many women in the countryside are not frugal when cooking, scattering rice and flour, and feeding leftover rice and soup to cattle and pigs. A lot of grain can also be saved from this loophole. Back, he discussed it with Duan Bo'an, the director of the village representative, and felt that "a thousand bits add up to a whole" (meaning that small savings add up to a lot). They also gave the women a detailed calculation. He used the general situation in the village to deduce that each household wastes at least four liang of flour for three meals a day. The entire village has fifty households, which, calculated at thirty days a month, means a waste of 375 jin of flour. Accounts are scary when calculated in detail. This time, many women became more careful when cooking.

    On the evening of October 6th, Su Yanhu gathered the main cadres of the village together. In addition to studying the methods mentioned above, they also discussed from which other aspects they could save grain. At this time, everyone spoke up more, and there were more ideas. In the past, millet was used to make vinegar; from now on, bran should be used instead. In the past, black beans and peas were directly applied to the fields; now, they plan to extract the oil first, use the residue left after the oil extraction to feed the pigs, and then use the pig manure to fertilize the fields. The grain received at home should also be stored well. Duan Bo'an said that there were many rats in his house, and sometimes one or two jin of grain were eaten by rats from one dou of grain. Lei Chonglv also said that every family had rats, and they damaged the most grain. In addition, the grain bins were not covered, and sparrows caused a lot of damage. Some people put their grain in damp and shady places because they lacked granaries, which easily caused it to mold and become infested with insects. At the meeting, everyone came up with ways: adding lids to the grain bins, taking good care of preventing rats, and putting the grain in dry places. The whole village could also reduce the loss of more than ten shi of grain. The next day, Su Yanhu calculated the grain saved by the whole village and found that the whole village could save more than 16,000 jin a year, which is more than 55 dan (large stone). He also posted this detailed calculation on the blackboard bulletin. After reading the bulletin, mutual aid group leader Duan Shihai calculated the number again and found that it could buy 92 new-style ploughs or 15 Liberation-style waterwheels. Some people also said, "If our Chang'an County, if the villagers in our entire province, could save like this, we could build several large factories." Now, the farmers in Bei Yu Nu Village no longer say, "There's nothing to save."

    “没啥节约”吗
    董墅
    陕西长安县渭滨区十乡北玉女村里年年闹丰产运动，收入一年比一年多，“半年糠菜半年粮”的穷日子过去了。如今，不论左邻右舍，揭开锅来，干的多，稀的少；拿出馍来，白的多，黑的少；端出饭来，细的多，粗的少。正因为这样，就有一些农民大手大脚起来，磨面不磨净，米面随便撒，粮仓阴湿，老鼠蹧蹋……对这些“小事”，满不在乎。乡支部书记苏彦虎在村里处处留神这些“小事”。一天，淡明智正卸磨子，他一看麸皮不净，便用手试了一下。麸皮上还粘了一层白面，如果再磨两遍，一斗麦至少还能磨出一斤半面。苏彦虎问他为什么不磨净呢？淡明智笑着说：“人吃，牲口也要吃。磨得那么净，牲口吃啥哩！”苏彦虎想了一想，说：“有料没料，四角挠到，牲口喂的好坏，主要看水草均匀。”接着，他给淡明智解释节约粮食的道理。可是，淡明智不听，还讥笑苏彦虎太“小气”，他说：“村里都是这个磨法，不是我特别呀！”苏彦虎搬开指头算了算：北玉女村二百七十口人，每人每月吃二斗，全村共吃五十四大石，每斗磨净多磨一斤半面，每月就能多出八百一十斤面。苏彦虎说罢，淡明智这才吐了一下舌头，说道：“这么算下来，可真不少！”说着，多磨了两遍。这个细账一传开，第二天，段世奇等户，在磨面的时候，都磨得很净。
    又一天，苏彦虎走进妇女张秀英家，见她把剩的两碗饭，倒在牲口槽里。苏彦虎想：农村很多妇女，做饭不俭省，抛撒米、面，剩饭剩汤，都喂牛喂猪啦。从这一个漏洞里，也可以节省很多粮食。回来他跟村代表主任段伯安一商量，觉得“千厘搁一整”（即积少成多之意），他们便向妇女们也算了个细账。他拿村里的一般情形推算，每户每天三顿饭，至少抛撒四两面。全村五十户，每月以三十天算，就要浪费三百七十五斤面。账怕细算，这一下，许多妇女做饭都细心了。
    十月六日晚上，苏彦虎把村里的主要干部，召集在一块，除了研究上面讲的那些办法，还商量再从那些方面来节约粮食。这时，大家发言也多啦，办法也稠啦。过去用小米做醋的，今后要改用麸皮做；过去用黑豆、豌豆直接上地的，准备先榨了油，用榨过油剩下的渣喂猪，然后用猪粪去上地。收到家里的粮食，也要保管好。段伯安说他家里老鼠很多，一斗粮食，有时被老鼠吃掉一、二斤。雷崇绿也说老鼠家家都有，损害粮食最多。另外像粮食囤不盖，麻雀损害也很厉害。有的人因为缺粮仓，把粮食放在又湿又阴的地方，容易霉烂，容易生虫。会上大家就想办法：给粮食囤上加上盖、好好防鼠、把粮食放在干地方，全村也能减少十多石粮食的损失。第二天，苏彦虎把全村节约的粮食算了一下，一年全村可节约一万六千多斤，折合五十五大石还多。并且把这笔细账公布在黑板报上。互助组长段世海看了报，又把这个数目算了一算，可以买新式步犁九十二架，买解放式水车十五架。有的人还说：“如果咱长安县、咱们全省的乡亲都能这样节约，就可以修几个大工厂哩。”现在北玉女村的农民，再也没有人说：“没啥节约”的了。
