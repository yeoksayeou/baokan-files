The Northeast Dailing Forest Industrial Bureau
    Successful Forest Inter-Row Seedling Cultivation

    Forestry workers at the Northeast Dailing Forest Experiment Bureau have achieved success with inter-row seedling cultivation in forests. Several years ago, they sowed Korean pine seeds in harvested areas, but almost all the seeds planted were eaten by squirrels, birds, and wild boars. They then coated the Korean pine seeds with foul-smelling oil and guarded the sowing area by beating gongs, but because the area was too large, the seeds were still eaten. Later, they planted the seeds in a nursery in Dailing, but the limited area of the nursery could not keep up with actual needs, and the cost was also high. Last year, they cultivated land in the deep forest area and implemented inter-row seedling cultivation, a method that has been successful. In a forest nursery five kilometers north of Dailing, they sowed more than five million seeds of larch, Korean pine, ash, and other species, and these small seedlings have grown densely. Some are already over half a person tall and can be transplanted to the mountains next year. Inter-row nurseries are also easy to protect; sometimes, only one or two people need to beat gongs and drums to scare away wild animals that steal the seeds. Due to the success of inter-row seedling cultivation, the Dailing Forest Experiment Bureau will be able to fully achieve simultaneous harvesting and planting in two more years. (Chen Yongjin)

    东北带岭森林工业局
    林间育苗获得成功
    东北带岭森林工业实验局的林业工人实行林间育苗获得成功。几年前，他们就在采伐过的地方播了红松种籽，几乎是埋下的所有的种籽都为松鼠、鸟雀、野猪吃掉了。他们又在红松种籽上涂上臭油，在播种的地带敲锣警卫，因为面积太大，也仍然被吃掉了。后来，他们便种植在带岭的一个苗圃上，但因一个苗圃面积有限，赶不上实际需要，而且成本也高。去年，他们在深林地带耕出地来，实行林间育苗，这一方法已获得成功。在离带岭北五公里一个林间苗圃里，他们播种了五百多万棵黄花松、红松、水曲柳等种籽，这些小树苗，已经密密麻麻地长起来。有的已有半人多高，明年就可移植到山上去。林间苗圃也容易防护，有时只要一两个人敲敲锣鼓来惊吓偷吃种籽的野兽就行了。带岭森林工业实验局由于林间育苗的成功，再过二年就可全部做到随采随种。    （陈勇进）
