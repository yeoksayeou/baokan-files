Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th: The speech of the Chinese explanation representative of the Korean-Chinese explanation delegation to all captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The full text is as follows:

Dear Comrades in Distress:

First of all, on behalf of the people of the motherland, the leaders of the Volunteer Army, and all comrades-in-arms, we extend our cordial greetings to you.

Since you were captured, you have suffered greatly from hardships and tortures. The people of the motherland, all the comrades-in-arms of the Volunteer Army, and your parents and relatives are constantly thinking of you, knowing that you have suffered the greatest hardships, and are looking forward to your early return.

Now, the Korean armistice has been realized, and the time for you to return home has come. We are specially dispatched by the people of the motherland and the leaders of the Volunteer Army to express our condolences to you and to welcome you back to the motherland.

Comrades! The people of Korea and China, as well as the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army, have made the greatest efforts to win the right for you to return home. In the process of the armistice negotiations, in order to oppose any attempt to forcibly detain you, we persisted in the struggle on the battlefield and at the negotiating table for a year and a half, until our demands were victorious. Now, according to the armistice agreement and the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," you have been released from the military control and custody of the other party. You are now under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission composed of representatives from India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland. This supervisory commission was specifically established to "ensure that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated after the armistice." Therefore, you have now been given the opportunity to exercise the right to repatriation. As long as anyone applies, they can be sent back to the motherland immediately. In fact, before our explanation delegation arrived here, seventy-nine Volunteer Army comrades had already expressed their desire to return home to the Indian custodial forces and were immediately sent to our area. Among them are Wang Xu, who served as the prisoner of war representative of the 4th Battalion of the 3rd Regiment, Li Jinquan, who served as the battalion commander of the officer team of the 1st Regiment, and Wang Shixin and Liu Shuanggui of the 1st Regiment, Zhang Zhenye of the 2nd Regiment, Huang Lichao and Zhang Shiying of the 3rd Regiment, and other comrades you are familiar with. Now they have all returned to the embrace of the motherland and are living a free and happy life again. Now, no one is allowed to obstruct you from realizing your desire to return home. It is illegal for anyone to threaten you, and you can file a complaint.

Comrades! The people of the motherland and all the comrades-in-arms of the Volunteer Army know that your experiences after being captured are extremely unfortunate. You were forced to tattoo words on your bodies, write certain documents, join certain organizations, hold certain positions in the other side’s prisoner of war camps, or perform other similar acts. These were all forced upon you by others. They attempted to use these facts to create your concerns about returning home in order to achieve their goal of forcibly detaining you. However, the people of the motherland and all the comrades-in-arms of the Volunteer Army fully understand your suffering and completely forgive your actions. As early as April 6, 1952, that is, before you were illegally "reviewed," the spokesman of the Supreme Headquarters of the Korean People's Army and the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army issued a statement announcing that these actions of yours were by no means voluntary. Therefore, you should not be held responsible. Our side fully welcomes all our captured personnel back to the embrace of the motherland. Recently, Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People’s Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army, issued a letter to captured personnel, solemnly announcing that no matter what kind of behavior you have engaged in in the prisoner of war camp as mentioned above, as long as you return to the motherland, you will not be held accountable for the past; all returnees will be reunited with their families, participate in the construction of the motherland, and live a peaceful life. Comrades, after reading this letter, you will know that any concerns are unnecessary. The only thing you need to do now is to bravely and resolutely apply and exercise your right to repatriation.

Comrades! You are all sons and daughters of the people of the motherland. The people of the motherland are infinitely concerned and caring for you. You have contributed your strength and shed your blood in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and you have contributed to the cause of defending Korean independence, safeguarding the security of the motherland, and safeguarding peace in the East. The people of Korea and China will not forget this. We sincerely hope that everyone will dispel their concerns, promote the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, and bravely and resolutely exercise your sacred and inviolable right to return to the motherland. The people of the whole country are welcoming you, and your relatives are waiting for you.

Finally, I wish you good health, good spirits, and an early return to the country to reunite with your loved ones.

    我国解释代表向志愿军被俘人员的讲话
    【新华社开城十六日电】朝中解释代表团中国解释代表向中国人民志愿军全体被俘人员的讲话。全文如下：亲爱的被难同志们：
    我们首先代表祖国人民、代表志愿军首长和全体战友，向同志们致亲切的慰问。
    你们自从被俘以后，受了很大的苦难与折磨，祖国人民、志愿军的全体战友、你们的父母亲人时时刻刻都在挂念你们，知道你们受了最大的苦难，都在盼望着你们早日回来。
    现在，朝鲜停战已经实现，你们回国的时机已经到来，我们受祖国人民和志愿军首长的派遣，特地来慰问你们，来迎接你们回祖国。
    同志们！朝中两国人民以及朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军为了给你们争得回国的权利，曾尽了最大的努力。在停战谈判的过程中，我们为了反对任何强迫扣留你们的企图，曾经在战场上和谈判桌上坚持了一年半的斗争，直到我们的主张得到胜利。现在，根据停战协定与“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定，你们已由对方的军事控制与看管下释放出来了。你们现在是在由印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞典、瑞士五国代表组成的中立国遣返委员会看管之下。这个看管委员会是特地为“保证全部战俘在停战之后有机会行使其被遣返的权利”而成立的。因此，你们现在已经得到了行使遣返权利的机会，每一个人只要提出申请，就立即可以送回祖国。事实上，在我们解释代表团到达这里以前，就已经有七十九位志愿军同志向印度看管军表示了回国的愿望而立即被送到了我方地区。其中有当过第三联队四大队战俘代表的王旭，当过第一联队军官队大队长的李金泉，和第一联队的王士新、刘双贵，第二联队的张振业，第三联队的黄立超、张世英等等你们熟悉的同志，现在他们都已回到祖国的怀抱，重新过着自由幸福的生活。现在，决不允许任何人阻挠你们实现回国的愿望。不论那一个人，要威胁你们都是非法的，你们可以提出控诉。
    同志们！祖国人民和志愿军全体战友都知道，你们在被俘以后的遭遇是极其不幸的。你们被迫在身上刺了字，写过某种文件，参加过某种组织，在对方战俘营中担任过某种职务或作了其他类似行为。这都是别人强迫你们作的。他们企图利用这些事实来制造你们回国的顾虑，以达到强迫扣留你们的目的。但是祖国人民和志愿军全体战友对你们的痛苦是完全了解的，对你们的行为是完全原谅的。早在一九五二年四月六日，也就是在你们被非法“审查”以前，朝鲜人民军最高司令部及中国人民志愿军司令部发言人就曾经发表了一个声明，宣布：你们的这些行为绝非出于你们的自愿。因此，不应由你们负责。我方完全欢迎我方全体被俘人员回到祖国怀抱。最近朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅、中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军又发表了告被俘人员书，郑重地宣布：不管你们在战俘营中有上述何种行为，只要回到祖国，一律不咎既往；一切归国人员，均将与家人团聚，参加祖国建设事业，并过和平生活。同志们，你们见了这封信，就可以知道什么顾虑都是不必要的。你们现在唯一需要作的事，就是勇敢坚决地提出申请，行使遣返权利。
    同志们！你们都是祖国人民的儿女。祖国人民对你们是无限关怀，无限爱护的。你们在抗美援朝战争中出了力、流了血，对于保卫朝鲜独立，保卫祖国安全与保卫东方和平的事业是有贡献的，朝中两国人民是不会忘记的。我们诚恳地希望大家打消顾虑，发扬团结互助的精神，勇敢坚决地行使你们神圣不可侵犯的返回祖国的权利。全国人民都在欢迎你们，你们的亲人都在等待你们。
    最后，祝大家身体健康，精神愉快，早日回国，和亲人团圆。
