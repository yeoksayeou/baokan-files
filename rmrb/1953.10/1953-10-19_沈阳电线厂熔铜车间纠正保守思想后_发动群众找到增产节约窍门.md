After the Party Branch of the Copper Smelting Workshop of Shenyang Wire Factory corrected the conservative thinking of cadres and deeply mobilized the workers to launch a production increase and economy practice campaign, the copper smelting time was shortened.

(This dispatch) In the past, the copper smelting workshop could only smelt 380 tons of copper per month. After the launch of the production increase and economy practice campaign, according to the requirements of other workshops, it was necessary to complete an average of 480 tons of copper smelting per month starting in September. At that time, some cadres said, "This is nonsense, we simply cannot complete it." Other cadres said, "Our copper smelting workshop can only economize, not increase production, because the furnace cannot be loaded more." When the secretary of the workshop's Party branch heard this conservative argument, he consulted with the workers. An old worker told him that in the past, there was a time when one furnace was produced in 19 hours (at that time, it took 24 or 25 hours to smelt a furnace of copper). The Party branch secretary felt more confident than before, and raised the workers' opinions at a cadre meeting. At the meeting, everyone calculated according to the 19 hours of smelting one furnace of copper, and there were still more than 100 tons of copper smelting tasks that could not advance the operation plan. But at this time, everyone had already thought that since it was possible to produce a furnace in 19 hours in the past, there must be advanced experience in this. So, an enlarged meeting of the Party branch committee was held to analyze the process from loading the furnace to discharging the furnace. As a result, it was determined that if preparations were made in advance in terms of loading materials, each furnace could be shortened by half an hour; in terms of smelting, if we learn from Chai Chenglin's firing method, master certain rules for watching the fire, sifting the furnace, and adding coal, and maintain a certain temperature, each furnace can be shortened by more than three hours; when discharging the furnace, if we learn from Ji Wanzhong's advanced experience of being stable and accurate, each furnace can be shortened by half an hour. Therefore, it is certain that as long as we mobilize the masses and promote advanced experience, the task of increasing production and practicing economy can be completed.

The call to strive for producing a furnace of copper in 19 hours reached the team. The team leader held a meeting and recalculated the details, and found that the copper smelting time of 19 hours could be shortened by another half an hour. This reversed the negative thinking of individual cadres who believed that the copper smelting task "simply could not be completed." Then, the Party branch held a meeting of Party members, Youth League members, and activists, mobilizing everyone to take the lead in learning advanced experience, leading the masses to carefully calculate the accounts, and find tricks to ensure an average of 480 tons of copper smelting per month. After the meeting, the workshop cadres went to the teams to help carefully calculate the accounts, which achieved great results. The problem of shortening the oxidation time, which had not been considered before, was also solved this time, and specific methods were found. Jiang Yongxiang's team proposed changing one furnace door for feeding materials to two furnace doors, which can also shorten the smelting time.

After discussion by all the staff, the workshop found advanced experience and advanced individuals in various processes that had existed in the past but had not been discovered. According to the comprehensive calculation, it only takes 18 hours and 10 minutes to produce a furnace of copper, which is 20 minutes shorter than the expected 18 and a half hours. The workers put forward a total of 13 tricks and 23 reasonable suggestions, which not only can guarantee an average of 480 tons of copper smelting per month, but also can exceed 105 tons by the end of the year. These tricks and reasonable suggestions not only significantly increased production, but also greatly reduced the reject rate and material consumption. Now, the advanced experience of Jiang Yongxiang's team in shortening the furnace output time and ensuring quality has been promoted throughout the workshop. The old worker Ji Wanzhong summarized the advanced experience of pouring copper water quickly and evenly, which greatly reduced the number of copper ingots that were scrapped due to "voids," from an average of more than two tons per furnace to 600 or 700 jin. Inspired by Ji Wanzhong, Li Yunlin improved the operation method of brushing bone ash, solving the problem that copper ingots had been scrapped due to pitting for several years. Therefore, the qualification rate of copper ingots was guaranteed to increase from 89.81% to 94%, and the consumption rate was reduced from 2.36% to 2%. By September 15, the average time for smelting copper in each furnace in the workshop had been reduced to 18 and a half to 19 hours. The shortest furnace on September 12 took only 17 hours and 2 minutes.

    沈阳电线厂熔铜车间纠正保守思想
    后发动群众找到增产节约窍门
    【本报讯】中共沈阳电线厂熔铜车间支部纠正干部的保守思想，深入发动职工群众开展增产节约竞赛，缩短了熔铜的时间。
    熔铜车间过去每月只能熔化三百八十吨铜，增产节约竞赛开始以后，根据其他车间的要求，必须从九月份起每月平均完成四百八十吨的熔铜任务。当时有的干部说：“这是瞎扯，我们根本不能完成。”还有的干部说：“我们熔铜车间只能节约不能增产，因为炉不能多装。”车间党支部书记听到这种保守的论调，便找工人商量。有一个老工人告诉他说，过去曾有过十九小时出一炉的时候（当时熔一炉铜需要二十四、二十五个小时）。党支部书记心里比以前有底了，便在一次干部会上把工人的意见提了出来。会上大家按十九小时熔化一炉铜的时间计算，还有一百多吨熔铜的任务无法推进作业计划。但是这时大家已想到过去既然能够十九小时出一炉，这里边一定有先进经验。于是便召开党的支委扩大会议，从装炉到出炉按工序进行分析。结果，断定在装料方面如事先做好准备工作，每炉可缩短半小时；在熔化方面如果学习柴成林的烧火法，看火、筛炉、添煤掌握一定规律，保持一定温度，每炉又可以缩短三个多小时；出炉时如学习计万忠的稳而准的先进经验，每炉可缩短半小时。因此肯定：只要发动群众，推广先进经验，增产节约任务是可以完成的。
    争取十九小时出一炉铜的号召到了小组，小组长开会再一算细账，发现十九小时的熔铜时间还可以缩短半小时。这才扭转了个别干部认为熔铜任务“根本就不能完成”的消极思想。接着，党支部又召开了党员、团员和积极分子大会，发动大家带头学习先进经验，领导群众算细账，找窍门，保证平均每月熔铜四百八十吨。会后，车间干部分头深入小组帮助算细账，收到了很大的成绩。以前没有考虑到的缩短氧化时间问题，这回也解决了，并找到了具体的办法。姜永祥小组提出把一个炉门进料改为两个炉门进料，熔化时间还可缩短。
    经过全体职工的讨论，该车间在各个不同的工序中都找出了过去已经有的而没有发现的先进经验和先进人物。综合起来计算，只用十八小时零十分钟就可以出一炉铜，比预计的十八小时半又缩短了二十分钟。职工们共提出了十三个窍门、二十三件合理化建议，这不但可以保证每月平均熔化四百八十吨铜，累计到年底可超过一百零五吨。这些窍门与合理化建议，不但显著提高了产量，同时大大降低了废品率和材料消耗量。现在，姜永祥小组保证缩短出炉时间和保证质量的先进经验已在全车间推广。老工人计万忠总结了浇铜水要快要匀的先进经验，使铜锭因“起空”而造成废品的数量大大减少，由平均每炉废两吨多减少到六、七百斤。李箤林在计万忠的启发下，又改进了刷骨灰的操作法，解决了几年来因铜锭有麻子而变成废品的问题。因此，保证了铜锭的合格率由百分之八十九点八一提高到百分之九十四，消耗率由百分之二点三六降低到百分之二。到九月十五日，该车间每炉熔铜的时间平均即降到十八小时半到十九小时了，在九月十二日最短的一炉，只用了十七小时零二十分钟。
