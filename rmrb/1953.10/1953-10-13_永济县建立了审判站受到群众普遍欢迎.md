    Yongji County Establishes Tribunal Stations, Widely Welcomed by the Masses

    Su Yumin from the People's Procuratorate of Yongji County, Shanxi Province, writes: Yongji County has a vast area, and the Zhongtiao Mountains divide it into northern and southern sections. The county government is located in the northern part. It is not easy for the masses in the southern part to travel to the county seat. This year, in July, the County People's Court established a tribunal station in Xiaoli Town in the south, handling cases from the 15th to the 25th of each month. The court sends the president, judges, trainees, and bailiffs to work at the tribunal station. In July, they brought 25 civil cases to the tribunal station and newly received 10 cases there. In August, they brought 11 cases and newly received 19 cases; all but one have been closed.

    In these two months, except for major cases that the masses filed in the county court, they generally handed them over to the tribunal station for handling. In the past, for the masses in the south to go to the county seat, it took two days by train, plus two or three days for the court to summon people and wait; it cost a lot of money and delayed production. Now, the most remote place in the south is only 40 li away from Xiaoli Town, and Xiaoli Town is a market town. Some people solved disputes on the side while going to the market, and they could return on the same day. Some parties involved said to the working comrades: "Comrades, this time you have saved us a lot of trouble." The masses generally reflected: The government is very thoughtful, and it has come to our doorstep to handle affairs.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    永济县建立了审判站受到群众普遍欢迎
    山西省永济县人民检察署苏裕民来信：永济县地区辽阔，中条山把它分为条南条北两个部分。县人民政府设在条北。条南的群众要到县城去一次很不容易。县人民法院今年七月在条南晓里镇建立了一个审判站，每月十五日到二十五日处理案件。法院派往审判站工作的有院长、审判员、练习生、法警各一人。七月份带到审判站处理的有民事案二十五件，在审判站又新收了十件。八月份带来案子十一件，新收案十九件；除一件外，已全部结案。
    两个月中，群众除重大案件有到县法院起诉的外，一般都交到审判站处理。过去条南的群众上县城，搭火车来回两天，加上法院传人、等待，又是两三天；花钱很多，又耽误了生产。现在，条南最边远的地方离晓里镇也只四十里，加上晓里镇是个集镇，有的群众上集捎带解决了纠纷，当天就能回去。有的当事人对工作同志说：“同志，这回可给我们省下工夫啦。”群众普遍反映：政府想的太周到了，到咱家门口办事来了。
