Xinhua News Agency, October 29th.

    Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, met on October 29th with the delegation of the Japanese "Diet Members Promoting Japan-China Trade League," including the head of the delegation, Masanosuke Ikeda, deputy heads Natsuo Eto, Keishi Hozumi, Koichi Nakamura, and other members of the delegation. During the meeting, Guo Moruo discussed the Chinese people's movement to defend peace and the relationship between China and Japan.

    After a detailed introduction to the development of China's peace movement, Guo Moruo said: The Chinese people distinguish between the Japanese people and the Japanese government. The Chinese people are willing to enhance friendship with the Japanese people. However, the Yoshida government of Japan's various measures are completely hostile to the Chinese people.

    Guo Moruo cited many vivid facts to illustrate that Japan today has in fact become a dependency of the United States and an American military base in the Far East. He pointed out that there are still some reactionaries in Japan today who are still dreaming of reliving the old days, attempting to use the power of the United States to revive Japanese militarism and imperialism, and to push Japan back onto the road of aggression.

    Speaking of Japan's armament issue, Guo Moruo said: The Chinese people believe that an independent, democratic, peaceful, and free Japan should retain its self-defense armed forces. However, this self-defense armed force is completely different from Japan's rearmament under American control with the intention of launching new aggression. Rearmament under American control is a major disaster for the Japanese people and is resolutely opposed by the Chinese people, the Asian people, and peace-loving Japanese people.

    Guo Moruo pointed out that some people in Japan confuse the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance with the infamous "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," which is completely wrong. He said: The main goal of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance is to "jointly prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the re-aggression by Japan or other states that may unite with Japan in aggression in any form." Therefore, it is entirely a peaceful treaty. The "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," on the contrary, is clearly a treaty that is hostile to China and the Soviet Union, a war treaty in which the United States uses the Japanese people as paws for aggression.

    Guo Moruo finally paid tribute to the Japanese people who are waging a difficult struggle to win independence, democracy, peace, and freedom for their motherland. He also stated: From the Chinese people's point of view, if Japan severs relations with the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang in Taiwan, if Japan gets rid of its status as a vassal and follower of American aggression, and if Japan becomes a peaceful and independent country, then not only can normal relations between China and Japan be established and developed, but the signing of a non-aggression treaty between China and Japan can also be considered. Before the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between China and Japan today, the Chinese people are willing to first develop economic and cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese people, and work together with the Japanese people to defend Asian and world peace.

    Guo Moruo ended his speech with a toast to the ever-growing friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

### 在接见日议员促进日中贸易联盟代表团时  郭沫若就中日关系问题发表谈话

    在接见日议员促进日中贸易联盟代表团时
    郭沫若就中日关系问题发表谈话
    【新华社二十九日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若在十月二十九日接见了日本“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”代表团的团长池田正之辅，副团长江藤夏雄、帆足计、中村高一和代表团团员。在接见时，郭沫若谈到了中国人民的保卫和平运动和中日两国的关系问题。
    郭沫若在详细地介绍了中国的和平运动发展情况之后说：中国人民是把日本人民和日本政府区别开来看的。中国人民愿意增进和日本人民的友谊。但是日本吉田政府的种种措施都是完全敌视中国人民的。
    郭沫若援引了许多生动的事实说明今天的日本，事实上已成为美国的附庸和美国在远东的军事基地。他指出：在日本今天还有一部分反动分子仍然在想重温旧梦，企图借美国的力量复活日本军国主义和帝国主义，把日本重新推上侵略的道路。
    谈到日本的武装问题，郭沫若说：中国人民认为，一个独立、民主、和平、自由的日本，应该保有它的自卫武装力量。但是这种自卫的武装力量和日本在美国控制下企图重新侵略的武装，是完全不同的。在美国控制下的重整军备对日本人民是大灾难，而且是中国人民、亚洲人民和爱好和平的日本人民所坚决反对的。
    郭沫若指出在日本有人把中苏友好同盟互助条约和臭名远扬的“美日安全保障条约”混为一谈，是完全错误的。他说：中苏友好同盟互助条约的主要目标，是“共同防止日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其他用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略”。因此这完全是一个和平的条约。“美日安全保障条约”却相反，它十分明显的是与中苏两国为敌的条约，是美国利用日本人民做侵略猫爪的战争条约。
    郭沫若最后向正在为争取自己祖国的独立、民主、和平与自由而进行艰苦斗争的日本人民致敬。他并表示：从中国人民的立场来说，如果日本断绝与台湾蒋介石残余匪帮的关系，如果日本摆脱美国侵略主义的附庸国与追随者的地位，如果日本成为和平、独立的国家，那么中国与日本的正常关系不但可以建立和发展，而且在中国和日本之间订立互不侵犯条约，也是可以考虑的。在今天中日两国的正常外交关系尚未建立以前，中国人民愿意首先开展中日人民间的经济交流与文化交流，并和日本人民一道为保卫亚洲与世界和平而努力。
    在举杯祝中日两国人民的友谊日益发展声中，郭沫若结束了他的谈话。
