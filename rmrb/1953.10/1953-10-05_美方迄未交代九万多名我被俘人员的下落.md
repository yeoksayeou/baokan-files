Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 4th: The Korean-Chinese side delegation to the Military Armistice Commission issued a communique on the 3rd as follows:

According to the lists of captured Korean and Chinese personnel repeatedly submitted by the US side during the armistice negotiations, the lists of captured Korean and Chinese personnel compiled by the International Committee of the Red Cross in the course of the Korean War and forwarded by the US side, letters from captured Korean and Chinese personnel in US prisoner-of-war camps, and other materials publicly released by the US side, the Korean-Chinese side, after verifying the lists of captured Korean and Chinese personnel who have been directly repatriated and those claimed by the US side to have escaped or died, has proven that there are still 98,742 captured Korean and Chinese personnel who were once held by the US side, who have neither been repatriated nor accounted for by the US side. The US side once claimed to have handed over 22,602 of them to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody, but has not yet provided the Korean-Chinese side with the list of these 22,602 people. And it is known to the world that among those 22,602 people, there are in fact a large number of Chiang Kai-shek and Li Cheng-wan bandit gang secret agents posing as captured Korean and Chinese personnel. On September 21, the Korean-Chinese side submitted the aforementioned list of 98,742 captured Korean and Chinese personnel to the US side, but the US side has not made any response to date. At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on October 3, the Korean-Chinese side once again firmly demanded that the US side promptly provide a clear and responsible account of the aforementioned 98,742 captured Korean and Chinese personnel.

On the one hand, the US side avoids answering the lists of captured Korean and Chinese personnel that the US side should be responsible for accounting for as proposed by the Korean-Chinese side in the past, and on the other hand, it hurriedly and crudely compiles a list of captured United Nations forces personnel, saying that it wants the Korean-Chinese side to account for them. After verification by the Korean-Chinese side, it was discovered that 519 people on the list had already been directly repatriated to the US side by the Korean-Chinese side, and another 380 people had also been notified to the US side in the past that they had been released by the Korean-Chinese side at the front or had escaped. The remaining part are non-direct repatriates, and their list has been submitted by the Korean-Chinese side to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for transfer to the US side. The remaining part had never been captured. When the Korean-Chinese side notified the US side of the above situation at the Military Armistice Commission on September 21, the US side's chief commissioner, General Bryan, arbitrarily said: No one on the list submitted by the US side has been repatriated, nor has anyone been reported as dead or escaped.

In order to thoroughly expose the crude and poorly made list submitted by the US side and to prove the fallacy of the arbitrary remarks of the US side's chief commissioner, the Korean-Chinese side, at the Military Armistice Commission meeting on October 3, submitted to the US side's chief commissioner, General Bryan, the list of 519 captured United Nations forces personnel who had been directly repatriated by the Korean-Chinese side but the US side still wanted the Korean-Chinese side to account for, as well as the list of 380 captured United Nations forces personnel who had long been notified to the US side that they had been released or had escaped or died at the front by the Korean-Chinese side, but the US side insisted that the Korean-Chinese side had not made any explanation.

### 美方迄未交代九万多名我被俘人员的下落

    美方迄未交代九万多名我被俘人员的下落
    【新华社开城四日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面代表团三日发表公报如下：
    根据停战谈判中美方屡次交来的朝中被俘人员的名单、在朝鲜战争过程中红十字国际委员会转来的美方编制的朝中被俘人员的名单、在美方战俘营中的朝中被俘人员的来信以及美方所公开发表的其他材料，朝中方面在核对了已直接遣返的及美方声称已逃亡或死亡的朝中被俘人员的名单后证明，尚有九万八千七百四十二名曾为美方所收容的朝中被俘人员，既未被遣返亦未由美方作任何交代。美方曾声称已将其中的二万二千六百零二名交由中立国遣返委员会看管，但迄今尚未将该二万二千六百零二人的名单交给朝中方面。而举世皆知，在那二万二千六百零二人中，事实上混有大批冒充朝中被俘人员的蒋、李匪帮特务。朝中方面，在九月二十一日曾将上述九万八千七百四十二名朝中被俘人员的名单提交美方，但美方至今未作任何交代。在十月三日的军事停战委员会上，朝中方面再一次坚决要求美方迅速就上述九万八千七百四十二名朝中被俘人员作明确负责的交代。
    美方一方面对朝中方面历次提出的应由美方负责交代的朝中被俘人员的名单避不作答，另一方面又连忙粗制滥造地编出一份联合国军被俘人员的名单，说是要朝中方面交代。朝中方面经查对后，发现名单上有五百一十九名早已由朝中方面直接遣返给美方，另三百八十名也早已在过去通知过美方已由朝中方面在前线释放或已逃亡，其余部分是不直接遣返者，其名单已由朝中方面提交中立国遣返委员会请其转交美方，其余部分，则是从来没有被俘过的。当朝中方面将上述情况在九月二十一日的军事停战委员会上通知美方时，美方首席委员勃里安竟武断地说：美方所交来的名单中没有一个人被遣返，也没有一个人被报告为死亡或逃亡。
    为了彻底揭穿美方交来的粗制滥造的名单，并证明美方首席委员武断发言的谬误，朝中方面在十月三日的军事停战委员会上，又将上述已由朝中方面直接遣返而美方还要朝中方面交代的五百一十九名联合国军被俘人员的名单、以及早已通知美方已由朝中方面在前线释放或已逃亡或死亡而美方硬说朝中方面未作任何交代的三百八十名联合国军被俘人员的名单，提交美方首席委员勃里安。
