Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen: The new Danish parliament, elected on September 22nd, held its first meeting on October 6th. The new Danish Prime Minister, Hedtoft, announced the government's policy program in parliament. When discussing the government's foreign policy direction, he said that the government should pay close attention to the development of international events and not give up any opportunity to support the desire to consolidate peace and security. He said that the government welcomes the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement with pleasure, and hopes that the cessation of hostilities will pave the way for the peaceful development of the Far East. However, at the same time, he also supports the North Atlantic military bloc. Regarding the issue of foreign bases, he said that under the current circumstances, it is inappropriate to adopt the following suggestion: that Denmark allow "allied forces (that is, the armed forces of member states of the North Atlantic Alliance, primarily the United States military) to be permanently stationed in Denmark." He continued, "The government knows that Denmark's economic future is bleak." He pointed to the decrease in industrial exports, the loss of some foreign exchange earnings due to shipping, the beginning of difficulties in the sale of agricultural products, and the decline in agricultural product prices as examples. He said that Denmark must continuously expand its sales markets. Hedtoft said that expanding trade between the East and the West is extremely important for Denmark.

    不同意美国在丹麦驻军
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社哥本哈根讯：九月二十二日选举出来的丹麦新议会于十月六日召开第一次会议。丹麦新任总理赫托夫在议会上发表了政府的施政纲领。他在谈到政府外交政策的方针时说，政府要密切注意国际事件的发展，不放弃任何机会来支持巩固和平与安全的愿望。他说，政府以愉快的心情欢迎朝鲜停战协定的签订，并希望，这次敌对行动的停止能为远东的和平发展开辟道路。但是，同时他也支持北大西洋军事集团。说到外国基地的问题时，他说在目前的情况下，采纳下列建议是不适当的，即：有人建议丹麦让“盟国军队（也就是北大西洋联盟成员国的军队，首先是美国军队）经常驻扎丹麦”。他接着说：“政府知道，丹麦的经济前途是黯淡的。”他指出了工业输出减少、由于航运而损失一部分外汇来源、农业产品的销售开始发生困难、农产品价格下降等事实为例。他说，丹麦要不断地扩大销售市场。赫托夫说，扩大东方和西方之间的贸易对丹麦关系极其重大。
