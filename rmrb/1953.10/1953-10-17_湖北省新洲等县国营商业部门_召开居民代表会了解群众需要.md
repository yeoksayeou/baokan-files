    State-owned Commercial Departments in Xinzhou and Other Counties in Hubei Province
    Convene Resident Representative Meetings to Understand Mass Needs
    In order to ensure market supply during the peak season and fully meet the needs of residents, state-owned commercial departments in Xinzhou, Echeng, Xishui, Guangji and other counties in Hubei Province, under the unified leadership of the local Finance and Economic Committee and the Industry and Commerce Section, have successively convened resident representative symposiums to specifically understand the needs of residents.
    The representatives attending the meeting included workers, farmers, urban residents, teachers, students, revolutionary soldiers, cadres (Guangji County also absorbed small vendors), generally fifty to eighty people, and a commodity exhibition was held in conjunction to solicit representatives' opinions on the supply of state-owned commerce.
    A female representative from Wuxue, Guangji County, said: "The washbasins sold by the company are of Grade A, but rural people prefer Grade C. As for sock garters, rural people like colorful ones, but the company sells plain ones. Men's socks should be more in dark brown, light blue, bean color, and medium gray, while women's socks are suitable in flesh color and snow white." A farmer representative from Wuxue said: "More floral cloth should be available, with trendy small flowers, not the big flowers of eight years ago. There should be both good and inferior goods, especially more mid-range goods." Wang Shangyun, a farmer representative from Xishui County, pointed to the Golden Dragon thermos and said, "This product is good, but the price is too high. We rural people can only use bamboo shell thermoses, which are cheap and useful." He also suggested, "Make more locally processed cotton yarn socks and towels for the winter. Rubber shoes should have round openings, and toothbrushes should preferably not exceed three or four thousand yuan apiece." A teacher representative from Wuxue said, "The company's calligraphy brushes are too expensive for rural students to afford. Students use five or six packs of unsized, rough-edged practice paper each season, but the company doesn't have them, and students are not satisfied."
    These opinions of the representatives not only educated the cadres but also provided a concrete basis for compiling commodity circulation plans. Each county revised and expanded its commodity circulation plan for the second half of the year based on the representatives' opinions. The Xishui Department Store expanded more than 30 varieties in small commodities alone through the representative meeting. Generally, cadres reflected, "Only from the residents' mouths can we truly understand the residents' needs." In addition, these opinions of the representatives powerfully criticized and corrected the "famous brand" mentality of some cadres who looked to large cities and neglected to procure and process materials locally to meet the needs of residents. The Xishui Cotton Fabric Store signed a contract with a local family factory to process Peace Woolen Cloth after the meeting.
    The representatives also raised criticisms and suggestions on the management methods and work style of cadres in state-owned commercial departments. For example, the representatives from Echeng raised the opinion: "When buying a pair of rubber shoes with different sizes, the cadre said, 'Goods once sold, no returns or exchanges allowed.'" A dock worker representative from Wuxue said: "The company opens at 9:00 a.m. and closes at 5:30 p.m. We go to work at 6:00 a.m. and don't get home until 7:00 p.m., so we can never buy goods from state-owned companies." A representative from Xinzhou suggested: Use more advertisements to promote newly arrived goods. To take care of illiterate farmers, illustrations can be used. It is also hoped that the attitude of the salespersons will be kind and not afraid of trouble.
    At the same time, through the representative meeting and commodity exhibition, people also put forward correct opinions on the improvement and enhancement of the quality and specifications of certain handicraft products.
    Through the resident representative symposiums, all counties greatly strengthened the policy viewpoints and mass viewpoints of the cadres, strengthened the connection between state-owned commercial departments and the masses, and, in particular, provided a solid basis for revising the commodity circulation plan for the second half of the year, laying a good foundation for meeting the needs of the broad masses and ensuring market supply during the peak season.

    湖北省新洲等县国营商业部门
    召开居民代表会了解群众需要
    湖北省新洲、鄂城、浠水、广济等县国营商业部门，为了保证旺季市场供应，充分满足居民的需要，在当地财政经济委员会和工商科的统一领导下，先后召开了居民代表座谈会，具体了解居民需要。
    参加会议的代表，有工人、农民、城市居民、教员、学生、革命军人、干部（广济县并吸收小商贩代表参加）等，一般是五十至八十人，并结合举行了商品展览会，征求代表对国营商业供应方面的意见。
    广济县武穴妇女代表说：“脸盆，公司卖的是甲种的，乡下人喜要丙种的多。袜带，乡里人爱花色的，公司卖的是素的。男人袜子，应该多办酱色、雪青、豆色、中灰色的，女袜适合肉色、雪牙色的。”武穴农民代表说：“花机布要多办些，要时新的小花，不要陈八年的大朵子花，好货次货都要有，特别是中等货要多办些。”浠水县农民代表汪尚云指着金龙热水瓶说：“这货好是好，可是价太高，我们农村只能用竹壳热水瓶，便宜又顶用。”并建议说：“过冬多办些本地加工的棉纱袜子和毛巾，胶鞋要圆口的，牙刷最好是不超过三、四千元
    一支的。”武穴教员代表说：“公司毛笔价太高，农村学生买不起。脱胶毛边纸练习本，每个学生一季总要用五、六本，公司没有，学生不满意。”
    代表们这些意见，不仅教育了干部，同时给编造商品流转计划提供了具体依据，各县都针对代表意见把下半年商品流转计划修正和扩大了，浠水百货商店通过代表会仅在小百货方面即扩大三十多种。一般干部反映：“只有从居民口里才能真正地了解到居民需要。”另外代表们的这些意见并有力地批判和纠正了部分干部眼向大城市，忽视就地取材，就地加工订货，以满足居民需要的“名牌”思想。浠水花纱布商店，在会后即与当地家属工厂签订了加工和平呢布的合同。
    代表们并对国营商业部门干部的经营方式与作风，也提出了批评和建议，如鄂城代表提的意见是：“买一双胶鞋，是两个码子的，出门后转去掉换，干部说：‘货物出门，概不退换’。”武穴码头工人代表说：“公司上午九点钟开门，下午五点半关门，我们上午六点钟上班，下午七点钟才回家，总是买不上国营公司的货。”新洲代表建议：对新到的货，多用广告宣传，为了照顾不识字的农民，可采用插图说明，更希望营业员同志态度和蔼，不怕麻烦。
    同时通过代表会和商品展览会，人们对某些手工业产品的质量，规格的改进与提高，也提出了正确意见。
    各县通过居民代表座谈会，大大地加强了干部的政策观点与群众观点，密切了国营商业部门与群众的联系，特别是为修订下半年商品流转计划，提供了确凿依据，为满足广大群众需要，保证旺季市场供应打下了良好基础。（张成信）
