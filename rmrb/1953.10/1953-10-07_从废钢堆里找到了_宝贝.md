    “Treasures” Found in Scrap Steel Pile
    Reader Wu Shunzhi writes: On August 28th, a large pile of "scrap steel" awaiting loading into the furnace for smelting was stacked at the entrance of the electric furnace steelmaking department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. Wang Shouwen, a mechanic from the plant's machine repair shop, passed by and took a careful look. He said, "These are all very useful lathe tools! Isn't it wasteful to melt them down as 'scrap steel'!"

    It turned out that most of this pile of "scrap steel," which had been discarded outdoors for a long time and was now ready to be loaded into the furnace for smelting, were very useful Japanese Kangsaki steel lathe tools. This batch of tools totaled three tons and nine hundred and fifty kilograms, including nine hundred and fifty large and small point tools, four hundred and thirty-six large and small offset tools, one thousand and eighty-four flat tools, and one hundred and sixty-five other special tools, estimated to be worth over two hundred million yuan.

    This fact shows how serious the irresponsible attitude of warehouse material management personnel in some enterprises is!

专栏：读者来信摘要

    从废钢堆里找到了“宝贝”
    读者吴顺智来信：八月二十八日，太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部的门口堆放着大批正待装到炉里去熔炼的“废钢”。该厂机修室机工王守温从这儿经过，仔细察看了一下，他说：“这些都是有大用处的车刀呀，把它当‘废钢’熔了，岂不是浪费！”
    原来这堆长期弃置露天，现在准备装炉熔炼的“废钢”，大部分都是很有用的日本机杆锋钢车刀。这批车刀共三吨零九百五十公斤，其中有大小尖刀九百五十七把，大小偏刀四百三十六把，平刀一千零八十四把，其他专刀一百六十五把，估计约值两亿元以上。
    这一事实，说明某些企业的仓库材料管理人员对工作不负责任的态度是何等严重！
