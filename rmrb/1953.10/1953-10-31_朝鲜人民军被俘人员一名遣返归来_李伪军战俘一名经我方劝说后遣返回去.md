Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 30th: On the morning of the 30th, another captured member of the Korean People's Army, Li Qiyuan, who broke through the control of special agents and requested repatriation, was handed over to our side by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC). When Li Qiyuan stepped off the repatriation vehicle in Panmunjom, he looked around suspiciously, obviously not yet believing that he could truly escape the control of the special agents and be repatriated. Only when he saw the receiving personnel from the Korean and Chinese side did his doubts dissipate, and a smile appeared on his face as he hurried forward to shake hands with them tightly. Due to the long-term reign of terror by the US-ROK special agents, Li Qiyuan was mentally disturbed. Therefore, he could not remember the number of the camp where he was detained, nor could he explain how he escaped the control of the special agents. He could only clearly say one sentence: "I want to return to the Republic, I want to go home to see my mother."

After Li Qiyuan escaped from the camp and applied for repatriation, the NNRC's Umpire Sub-Committee held four meetings to discuss his application. Li Qiyuan repeatedly expressed to the NNRC his desire to return to his homeland, but because he was mentally disturbed, he could not explain some situations clearly. On the 24th, the chairman of the Umpire Sub-Committee had already ruled his application valid. However, the Swiss representative still believed there were problems and refused to sign the enabling document. It was not until the 29th, when Li Qiyuan resolutely requested to return to the Republic again when he was in a clear state of mind, that he was approved for repatriation. On the 30th, a ROK Army prisoner of war, Kim Jae-hak, under the custody of the NNRC, was handed over to the other side by the NNRC after applying for repatriation. Before Kim Jae-hak was handed over to the custody of the NNRC, the authorities of our prisoner of war camp had repeatedly persuaded him to return home.

    朝鲜人民军被俘人员一名遣返归来
    李伪军战俘一名经我方劝说后遣返回去
    【新华社开城三十日电】三十日上午，又有一名突破特务控制要求遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员李琪垣由中立国遣返委员会遣交给我方。李琪垣在板门店走下遣送车时，两眼满怀疑惧地四下张望，显然还不相信真能摆脱特务的控制被遣返归来。当他发现朝中方面的接收人员时，才疑虑消释，脸上露出笑容，急忙走上前去与他们紧紧握手。由于美李特务的长期恐怖统治，李琪垣神经失常，所以他已记不清自己被拘留的营场的号码，也说不清是怎样逃出特务控制的，他只能说清楚一句话：“我要回共和国去，我要回家看母亲。”
    李琪垣逃出营场申请遣返以后，中立国遣返委员会生效委员会曾四次开会讨论他的申请。李琪垣屡次向中立国遣返委员会表示要返回祖国，但是由于精神失常，对有些情况说不清楚。二十四日，生效委员会主席已裁决他的申请有效。但是瑞士代表却仍然认为有问题，拒绝在生效书上签字。直到二十九日，李琪垣在神志清醒时再次坚决要求返回共和国，才被批准遣返回来。三十日，中立国遣返委员会看管下的一名李伪军战俘金在鹤在申请遣返以后，由中立国遣返委员会遣交给对方。金在鹤在被移交给中立国遣返委员会看管以前，我方战俘营当局曾多次劝他回家。
