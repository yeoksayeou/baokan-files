Actively Lead the Ideological Education of Design Personnel

The basic construction design work of 1953 has essentially concluded, and the more arduous design tasks of 1954 are now before us. Summarizing the design work of 1953, we can draw many valuable experiences and lessons, and the most important of these is that we must continue to conduct ideological education work among design personnel to master correct design thinking. This is a crucial link in continuously improving design standards and ensuring the smooth progress of future design work.

Any work must have correct guiding ideology. This is especially important for design work. First, because design is the concrete embodiment of the national plan, it must proceed from the country's political line and specific policies, comprehensively consider the relationship between politics, economy, and technology, and demonstrate a high degree of political and ideological content. However, many design personnel in our design departments today have previously studied backward capitalist design ideologies, and their technical viewpoints also differ. Under these circumstances, without the guidance of correct design thinking, it is difficult to improve our work and shoulder the serious and glorious tasks that the design department bears for national construction. Second, judging from the construction situation this year, the errors and losses caused by design work are still significant. One mine, whose restoration project has been completed, has a maximum daily output of 600 tons of coal, but because there is no dedicated railway line designed and the cost of transporting coal by horse-drawn carriages is high, it was forced to suspend production this year, and still requires a maintenance fee of 1.4 billion yuan per year; one machinery factory's original designed production quota was very low, but after Soviet experts helped correct some shortcomings, the designed production volume increased by 3.5 times; one electrical machinery factory originally planned to demolish more than 11,000 square meters of old factory buildings and add two workshops, but after Soviet experts recalculated the labor capacity and rationally allocated the work system, the construction area could be reduced by 9,000 to 10,000 square meters. These examples show that mastering correct design thinking is an urgent task at present. However, these are only one aspect of the problem, namely, the need. On the other hand, because many of our important projects are designed by the Soviet Union on our behalf, and some design departments in our country also have Soviet experts helping us with our work, this creates favorable conditions for us to learn from Soviet experience and master correct design thinking. Therefore, from the perspective of possibility, we should also seize this opportunity to intensify our learning and master correct design thinking.

Since the beginning of this year, administrative cadres and technical personnel of several design institutions have initially criticized some old design ideas and launched a wave of learning from advanced Soviet design ideas, thus beginning to recognize what is correct design thinking and what is wrong design thinking, which has improved both design thinking and work efficiency. This should be taken seriously. However, there are still some ideological obstacles on the road to progress that must be resolved in order to deepen and consolidate this learning wave. For example, some people believe that: "The design work has many shortcomings in terms of results, but the reasons are that the objective conditions are very poor." Some people ask: "The new ideas have not yet been mastered, do we still need the old ones?" Some young technicians say: "I haven't done any design yet, how can I examine design thinking?" There are also individual technicians who have realized that bourgeois design thinking is not good, but still hold a skeptical attitude towards advanced Soviet experience. These problems must be answered. First of all, we should admit that, due to various historical and current reasons, the current design conditions are indeed not satisfactory. However, conditions are only relative, and we should constantly create correct design conditions, such as increasing design strength, strengthening geological work, actively collecting technical data, promoting standard design, mastering technical and economic norms, and improving design plans, etc.; it is impossible to wait until all conditions are met before designing. At the same time, we should also recognize that the past erroneous designs are not all due to the lack of conditions, but mainly due to incorrect design thinking. Often, as long as correct thinking is applied, under the same conditions, the design can be done better. Therefore, the "conditions" argument is unfounded. Secondly, we should also admit that learning advanced Soviet design experience cannot be achieved overnight, but learning new design thinking does not negate all old technical achievements. Technology itself has no class nature, but how it is treated and applied can have different class viewpoints. Bourgeois ideology and technical viewpoints must not be wanted and must be opposed; we must establish new ways of thinking and progressive technical viewpoints. With correct thinking, whether it is old technology or new technology, as long as it is correct, it can be effectively used to serve our great cause. Therefore, we should not confuse thinking and technology. Again, mastering correct design thinking is a constant subject for every design personnel. Some young technicians may be less influenced by bourgeois design thinking and may accept new ideas faster, but if correct design thinking is not firmly grasped, if there are subjective, one-sided, and local viewpoints, as well as conservative thinking, etc., if these things are brought into the design work, it will cause errors and losses. Therefore, opposing bourgeois design thinking is by no means irrelevant to young technicians. As for those who still hold a skeptical attitude towards Soviet experience, they should examine their own design thinking and improve their design level in learning and practice.

According to the experience of several places, an effective method for conducting ideological education among design personnel and mastering correct design thinking is to summarize work, absorb on-site experience, study and summarize Soviet experience, and based on this, examine past designs, find shortcomings, and correct errors. The reason why we adopt this method is that ideological education is a very meticulous and long-term work, and this should be especially noted for scientific and technical personnel. To illustrate this point, we can quote a passage from Lenin's "On a Unified Economic Plan" in 1921, he said: "The task of the Communists within the State Commission for the Electrification of Russia is to use less commanding methods, or—to put it more correctly—to use no commanding methods at all, but to treat the scientific and technical experts (as is said in our Party Programme, these experts are, in the majority of cases, inevitably imbued with a bourgeois world-outlook and bourgeois habits) with exceptional circumspection and flexibility, to learn from them and to help them widen their outlook, to base ourselves on the findings of the various branches of science, to single out those people who are amassing verified facts and to effect a transition to the communist idea of organization, of division of labour, in this particular field—to get them gradually to accept that idea and not to imagine that communism can be decreed, can be imposed upon them; that is farthest from the truth. The agronomist will accept communism, the forester will accept communism, but they will accept it in a different way from that of the propagandist or the writer; they will accept it by force of the facts, as they are brought face to face with the fact that without communist ways there is no possible way of helping agriculture or forestry to recover from ruin. " This passage of Lenin's is of great significance for us to carry out ideological education work among design personnel. That is to say, we must, through their actual achievements in design, compare them with advanced Soviet experience, and inspire them to gradually recognize their mistakes and correct their design thinking. Of course, we must not therefore adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards the ideological education of design personnel. On the contrary, we should adopt a proactive attitude and lead this work in a guided, organized, and critical manner. Guided means that the Party and administrative responsible comrades of the design department should personally preside over this work. Because the ideological education of design personnel is both an arduous and meticulous work, it is by no means possible for one or two minor cadres or a temporary patchwork of a working group to do things well. Organized means that the organizational forces at all levels should be used to ensure that specific work is the responsibility of dedicated personnel, and special attention should be paid to organizing experienced and prestigious technical personnel to participate in the leadership, so that they can give full play to their role in learning. Critical means abandoning the rote discussion method, or the style of indiscriminately labeling people with ideological hats, but rather encouraging and inspiring design personnel to proceed from the results and facts of their work, link theory with practice, carry out criticism and self-criticism, affirm achievements, find shortcomings, expose thoughts and understandings, and initiate free debates, from which to recognize right and wrong, and gradually establish correct understanding. In the past, some places have taken crude methods to lead ideological education work, such as using the method of criticizing "key people" or using the method of investigating history and checking classes, which are all wrong, because this method cannot solve ideological problems. In some places, the examination of shortcomings developed into a concentration of energy to investigate responsibility, which is also not right. Because some of our errors in design can indeed be avoided but were not avoided, resulting in losses, which should be vigilantly noted; but some are indeed due to insufficient experience and are temporarily difficult to avoid. Even for the former type of error, criticism is of course necessary, but more importantly, it is still necessary to examine the specific shortcomings of the design, learn lessons, and educate everyone, rather than investigate responsibility in isolation. There are also some places where the inspection of work and ideological study are completely divorced from reality, starting only from abstract concepts or definitions, resulting in more and more incomprehension, and no benefit to people or things, and this phenomenon should be corrected immediately. The construction cause of the motherland is advancing by leaps and bounds, and the people are eagerly expecting the design personnel to catch up with the needs of the construction cause, and the design personnel must work hard to study and strive to master correct design thinking!

    积极领导设计人员的思想教育
    一九五三年基本建设的设计工作已经基本结束，更为繁重的一九五四年的设计工作任务正摆在我们面前。总结一九五三年的设计工作，可以得出很多宝贵的经验教训，而其中最主要的一条，就是必须在设计人员中继续进行思想教育工作，掌握正确的设计思想。这是不断提高设计水平、保证今后设计工作顺利进行的重要环节。
    任何一项工作，都必须有正确的指导思想。对于设计工作来说，这更是特别重要的。首先，因为设计乃是国家计划的具体体现，必须从国家的政治路线与具体政策出发，全面地考虑政治、经济与技术的关系，表现出高度的政治思想内容。而今天我们设计部门中为数仍然很多的设计人员，他们以前学习的都是落后的资本主义的设计思想，大家的技术观点也不相同。在这种情况下，如果没有正确的设计思想的指导，就很难改进我们的工作，担负起设计部门对国家建设所负担的严重而光荣的任务。其次，从今年的施工情况来看，设计工作所造成的错误和损失仍然是很大的。有一个矿井，恢复工程已经完成，最高日产量可达六百吨煤，但因为没有设计专用线，马车运煤成本又高，本年被迫停产，还年需维持费十四亿元；有一个机械工厂，原设计的生产定额很低，苏联专家帮助纠正了某些缺点后，设计生产量提高了三点五倍；有一个电机工厂，原计划拆除旧厂房一万一千多平方公尺，增建两个车间，苏联专家重新计算了劳动容量并将工系加以合理配置后，建筑面积可减少九千至一万平方公尺。这些例子说明掌握正确的设计思想，正是当前的迫切任务。然而，这些还只是问题的一个方面，即需要的方面。另一方面，由于我们很多重要工程委托苏联代为设计；在我国的一些设计部门中，也有苏联专家帮助我们工作，这就给我们创造了学习苏联经验、掌握正确设计思想的有利条件。因此，从可能性来看，我们也正应抓紧这个机会，加紧学习和掌握正确的设计思想。
    今年以来，若干设计机构的行政干部与技术人员，曾经初步批判了一些旧的设计思想，并展开了学习苏联先进设计思想的热潮，因而开始认识了什么是正确的设计思想和什么是错误的设计思想，使设计思想和工作效率都有所提高。这是应当重视的。但是，在前进的道路上，还有一些思想障碍，必须加以解决，才能使这种学习热潮深入和巩固。例如有的人认为：“设计工作就其结果讲是缺点很多的，但就其原因讲则是客观条件很差。”有的人发问：“新的思想还没有掌握，旧的一套还要不要？”有的青年技术人员说：“我还没有进行设计，从何检查设计思想？”还有个别的技术人员，已经认识到资产阶级设计思想是不好的，但对苏联的先进经验还抱着怀疑态度。对于这些问题，都必须予以解答。首先，我们应该承认，由于历史和现状的种种原因，目前的设计条件，是的确不能令人满意的。但是条件只是相对的，我们应该不断地创造正确的设计条件，例如增长设计力量，加强地质工作，积极汇集技术资料，推广标准设计，掌握技术经济定额，改进设计计划等等；决不可能等到一切条件都具备了再行设计。同时，也应该认识到，过去发生的错误设计，并不都是条件不具备，而主要是设计思想不正确，往往只要运用正确的思想，在同样条件下，就可以把设计作得更好一些。因此，“条件”论者是并没有根据的。其次，我们也应该承认，学会苏联先进设计经验的确不是旦夕可以成功的，但是学习新的设计思想，并不是否定一切旧有的技术成就。技术本身是没有阶级性的，只是如何对待它和运用它可以有不同的阶级观点。资产阶级的思想和技术观点，是一定不能要的，一定应该反对的；我们要树立新的思想方法和进步的技术观点。有了正确的思想，则无论是旧的技术或新的技术，只要它是正确的，都可以有效地使之为我们的伟大的事业服务。因此，我们不应该把思想和技术搅混起来。再次，掌握正确的设计思想，乃是每一个设计人员经常的课题。有一些青年的技术人员，他们受资产阶级设计思想的影响可能少一些，接受新的思想可能快一些，但正确的设计思想如果掌握不稳，如果有主观主义、片面和局部观点以及保守思想等等，如果把这些东西带到设计工作中去，就会造成错误和损失。因此反对资产阶级设计思想，决不是和青年技术人员无关的。至于迄今仍对苏联经验抱着怀疑态度的人，则更应该在学习和实践中，检查自己的设计思想，提高设计水平。
    根据若干地方的经验，在设计人员中进行思想教育，掌握正确设计思想的有效方法，是通过总结工作，吸收现场经验、研究和总结苏联经验，据此检查过去的设计，从中发现缺点，改正错误。我们所以要采取这种方法，是因为思想教育乃是一种十分细致的长期的工作，而对科学技术人员来说，更应特别注意这一点。为了说明这个道理，我们可以引用列宁于一九二一年在“论统一经济计划”一文中的一段话，他说：“共产党员在俄罗斯国家电气化委员会内部的任务就是要少用些命令手段，或是——正确些说——完全不用命令手段，而是要对科学专家和技术专家（正如俄共纲领上所说的那样，‘他们多半是不免浸透有资产阶级的世界观和习惯的’）采取异常慎重和灵活的态度，要向他们学习和帮助他们扩大他们自己的眼界，要根据相当科学部门底成果和事实材料出发，要时刻记着一点，即工程师承认共产主义思想所经历的途径并不像从前那些在秘密条件下工作的宣传员和著作家所经历的一样，而是经过他在自己那一门科学方面所达到的实际成果，例如农艺学家是循着自己的途径来承认共产主义思想的，植林学家是循着自己的途径来承认共产主义思想的等等。”列宁这一段话，对于我们在设计人员中进行思想教育工作有十分重要的意义。这就是说，我们必须通过他们在设计方面的实际成果，对比苏联的先进经验，启发他们逐渐地认识自己的错误，端正自己的设计思想。当然，我们决不可以因此就对设计人员的思想教育工作采取放任自流的态度。恰恰相反，我们应该采取积极的态度，有领导地、有组织地、有批判地来领导这项工作。有领导的，就是说应该由设计部门的党的和行政的负责同志，亲自主持这项工作。因为设计人员的思想教育既是一项艰巨的细致的工作，就决不是一两个次要干部或临时拼凑一个工作组就能把事情办好。有组织的就是要运用各级组织力量，使具体的工作有专人负责，并应特别注意组织有经验、有威望的技术人员参加领导，使他们在学习中充分发挥作用。有批判的就是要抛弃那种照本宣科的讨论办法，或者乱扣思想帽子的作风，而是要鼓励与启发设计人员从工作的成果和事实出发，把理论与实际联系起来，展开批评与自我批评，肯定成绩，发现缺点，暴露思想和认识，引起自由争论，从中认识是非，逐步树立正确的认识。过去有些地方曾经采取粗暴的办法来领导思想教育工作，例如用批判“重点人”的办法，用追历史查阶级的办法，这都是错误的，因为用这种办法是不能解决思想问题的。也有些地方，在检查缺点中发展到集中精力追究责任，这也是不应该的。因为我们设计中的错误，有些固然是可以避免而没有避免以致造成了损失，这是应当警惕地注意的；但也有些的确是由于经验不足暂时还难以避免的。就是对于前一种错误，批评固然是应该的，但更重要的，也还是检查设计的具体缺点，取得教训，教育大家，而不是孤立地去追究责任。还有些地方，在检查工作和思想学习中，完全脱离实际，只从抽象的概念或定义出发，结果愈学愈不明白，对事对人都毫无补益，这种现象也应该即速纠正。祖国的建设事业正在突飞猛进的前进，人民热切期待着设计人员迎头赶上建设事业的需要，设计人员必须努力学习，为掌握正确的设计思想而奋斗！
