    The Idea That "The State Plan Is Law" Should Be Promoted Correctly
    Editor's Note: Reader Wang Yucheng wrote to inquire whether, in light of the current state of economic development in our country, it is appropriate to promote the idea that "the state plan is law." Regarding this question, a brief reply is as follows:
    The national economy is a complex organic whole, and the development of each economic sector is closely linked and mutually constrained. Our plans are formulated based on the Party and the state's general guidelines, combined with the local social and economic conditions, and based on needs and possibilities. Therefore, once a plan is determined, we must adopt a positive attitude and effective methods to fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, launch labor competitions, tap potential capabilities and favorable factors, and combine the surging labor enthusiasm of the masses with the specific production tasks stipulated by the state, so as to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the state plan. Therefore, in order to establish the seriousness of the state plan and ensure its completion and overfulfillment, enterprise managers and workers should be educated to clearly establish the concept that "the state plan is law," so that they understand that completing the plan is a concrete contribution to the country's industrialization and gradual transition to socialism, a glorious task of the working class, and a duty to be fulfilled.
    However, under the current circumstances, simply and generally emphasizing that "the state plan is law" is not entirely appropriate. This is because the economic composition of our country is still very complex, and small producers and private capitalism still account for a considerable proportion of our economy; the state plan's requirements for different economic components are also different. For example, state-owned enterprises are subject to direct mandatory plans; private enterprises and individual agriculture and handicrafts are subject to indirect plans, which are estimates. At the same time, in state-owned enterprises, planning work has only just begun, experience is insufficient, and the planning management and responsibility system in enterprises is not yet complete, and some have not even been established. Therefore, when publicizing "the state plan is law," distinctions should be made, and emphasis should be placed on enlightening the ideological awareness of the masses.

### 应该正确地宣传“国家计划就是法律”

    应该正确地宣传“国家计划就是法律”
    编者按：读者王毓成来信询问，根据我国目前经济发展的情况，应否宣传“国家计划就是法律”？关于这个问题，简复如下：
    国民经济是一个复杂的有机整体，各个经济部门的发展是密切结合和互相制约着的。我们的计划是根据党和国家总的方针结合当地的社会经济情况，并根据需要与可能而制定的。因此，当计划确定后，就必须采取积极的态度和有效的办法，充分发动群众的积极性和创造性，开展劳动竞赛，挖掘潜在能力和有利因素，并把群众汹涌澎湃的劳动热忱和国家规定的具体生产任务结合起来，以保证国家计划的完成和超额完成。因此，为了树立国家计划的严肃性，保证国家计划的完成与超额完成，应该教育企业管理人员和职工群众，明确树立“国家计划就是法律”的观念，使他们懂得，完成计划就是对国家工业化、逐步过渡到社会主义的具体贡献，是工人阶级的光荣任务，也是应尽的责任。
    但是，在目前情况下，单纯而笼统地强调“国家计划就是法律”却不太妥当。因为我们国家的经济成份还很复杂，小生产者和私人资本主义在我国经济中还占相当大的比重；对不同的经济成份，国家计划上的要求也各有不同，如：对国营企业是直接的指令性的计划；对私营企业和个体农业、手工业则是间接计划，是估算性的计划。同时在国营企业中，计划工作也刚刚开始，经验不足，企业中的计划管理和责任制度还不完满，有的甚至还未建立。因此，在宣传“国家计划就是法律”时，应有所区别，并应着重启发群众的思想觉悟。
