Reader's Letters Abstract

    Wu Shikui, Secretary of the CPC Siyang County Yingmen District Committee, Should Make a Self-Criticism for Superstition and Waste
    Letters from readers Zhou Qinggao, Jin Taihe, and Ji Qun: Wu Shikui, Secretary of the CPC Siyang County Yingmen District Committee in Jiangsu Province, lives in Tanba Township, Likou District of this county. When his grandmother passed away on August 11th, he hosted banquets and accepted gifts, holding a lavish funeral; in addition to buying a large fat pig and inviting more than two hundred guests who ate forty-one tables of food, he also bought four hundred feet of white cotton cloth to make mourning clothes and spent a lot of money to make paper sedan chairs, paper horses, paper figures, flower pots, incense pavilions, small carts, small donkeys, and other superstitious items, and burned more than twenty stacks of ghost money. All the cadres in Yingmen District also collected more than one million yuan to buy ghost money to offer sacrifices at his home.
    Wu Shikui's feudal, superstitious, and wasteful behavior has already caused adverse political effects in the local area. The local masses generally reflect: the People's Government educates us not to be feudal and superstitious, and not to be wasteful; but the responsible cadres are taking the lead in doing it! We suggest that the CPC Siyang County Committee seriously investigate and deal with this matter, and educate Wu Shikui, so that he can make a public self-criticism to the masses in order to recover the negative impact.

    中共泗阳县营门区区委书记吴士奎迷信浪费应作检讨
    读者周庆高、金太和、济群来信：中共江苏省泗阳县营门区区委书记吴士奎，家住本县李口区谭坝乡。他祖母在八月十一日病故，他就请客受礼，大办丧事；除买了一口大肥猪，请了二百多个客人，吃了四十一桌饭菜外，还买了四百尺白洋布做孝衣，花了不少钱扎纸轿、纸马、纸人、花盆、香亭、小车、小驴等迷信用品，烧了二十多刀冥纸。营门区全乡干部也凑了一百多万元买了冥纸，到他家去祭奠。
    吴士奎这种封建迷信、铺张浪费的行为，在当地已经引起不良的政治影响。当地群众普遍反映：人民政府教育咱们别封建迷信，别浪费；可是负责干部却带头搞起来了！我们建议中共泗阳县委员会认真检查处理这件事，并对吴士奎进行教育，让他向群众作公开检讨，以挽回不良影响。
