    An Important Method for Leading Agricultural Production
    Recently, cadres working in rural areas and party and government leading organs have encountered a new problem in leading agricultural production. The problem is: Now that the nation has entered a period of planned construction, in order to meet the needs of national industrialization and the needs of the vast number of peasants for the development of productive forces after land reform, how should we strengthen specific leadership to raise the level of agricultural production a step further? To solve this problem, in addition to inspiring and guiding the peasant masses to voluntarily organize and implement mutual aid and cooperation, we must also strengthen specific leadership in agricultural production technology and other aspects.
    In order to strengthen specific leadership in agricultural production, party and government leading organs and model cadres in many places have adopted many methods to promote, guide, and impart advanced agricultural technologies, and have gained many successful experiences. Recently, the CPC Tianshui Prefectural Committee has also created very good experiences in this regard, which are also worthy of learning from in various places.
    Before the start of the winter wheat sowing work this year, the CPC Tianshui Prefectural Committee, taking advantage of the slack farming season, held an autumn sowing training class, training a large number of county, district, and township cadres and cadres who did not leave production, imparting farming techniques, studying experience in increasing production, and explaining the tasks and methods of rural party branches in leading production. This training class achieved good results. The trained cadres said: "This time, we have something to rely on to lead production when we go back." This fact once again proves that rural cadres are urgently demanding to learn advanced agricultural technologies and production experiences.
    It is a major task to raise the farming techniques of the vast and scattered peasants and to universally increase production. If we only rely on the strength of a few agricultural technicians or only pay attention to the technical improvement work of a few high-yield households, then it is obviously very difficult to achieve the goal of universal increase in production. Therefore, we urgently need to adopt methods such as opening short-term training classes to train a large number of rural work cadres in agricultural knowledge and technology, so that when they return to the countryside, they can more universally guide the general peasant masses to improve agricultural technology at any time. This should become an important method for us to lead agricultural production.
    Our current technical conditions for agricultural production are backward. Therefore, the work of improving agricultural technology must pay attention to strengthening, especially the guidance of the production technology of the general peasant masses. It is very wrong to underestimate and ignore this aspect of work. Because our country is carrying out the construction of the first five-year plan, which requires agriculture to increase production of more grain and industrial raw materials. In order to achieve universal increase in agricultural production, in addition to vigorously leveraging the power of organization, we must also strive to improve agricultural production technology and promote advanced agricultural production experience. Over the years, many high-yield farmers have been discovered in various places, and some high-yield experiences have been summarized. However, the promotion of these experiences is far from enough. Except for a few high-yield households, the farming techniques of general farmers have been rarely improved. Some local leaders always think that they do not know anything about agricultural production, and they also think that farmers have a set of skills for agricultural production, which does not require too much worry. They are subjectively complacent in this way and are unwilling to work hard to study methods of increasing production. This situation must be quickly changed.
    It must be seen that the current peasant masses who are dissatisfied with the old farming methods of the past are increasing day by day. They hope to gradually learn advanced farming techniques in order to improve production levels and increase harvests. At the same time, from the perspective of the overall development of agriculture, improving agricultural technology and promoting advanced agricultural production experience has become increasingly clearly an important key to further developing my country's agriculture. At this time, if our rural work cadres cannot grasp advanced agricultural production experience and agricultural technology according to the actual conditions of the local area, they will not be able to lead the peasants satisfactorily.
    Of course, in paying attention to the work of improving agricultural technology, we must first take into account the specific conditions of my country's agricultural production, the conditions of the small-scale peasant economy, pay attention to the low cultural level of the peasant masses, and the different climate and soil conditions in various regions. It is absolutely impossible to blindly and mechanically use a simple formula to promote agricultural technology. In the past, some places blindly promoted new-style walking plows, without asking whether these new agricultural tools were suitable for local farmers, nor teaching them how to use them, so that some new-style walking plows in the hands of farmers could only become "hanging plows", hanging them up and not using them; blindly advocating close planting also resulted in the phenomenon of "obviously dense but secretly sparse." These undoubtedly must be corrected. However, it is completely necessary to improve agricultural technology by inspiring the enthusiasm of rural cadres and the peasant masses based on the specific conditions of various places, starting from reality, and adapting to local conditions.
    We should fully grasp the overall spirit of improving agricultural technology in the "Instructions to Party Committees at All Levels on Spring耕 Production" issued by the CPC Central Committee on March 16th this year. This instruction says: "In the patriotic production increase movement, some places only pay attention to a few high-yield farmers, and neglect helping and leading the production of general farmers. This shortcoming should be corrected. Efforts should be made to improve agricultural technology. However, we must deeply understand the regional nature of agriculture and the decentralization of the small-scale peasant economy, and avoid mechanically applying so-called 'science and technology' that are not suitable for local conditions and generalizing certain technical improvement plans that are not suitable for regional characteristics."
    Now the experience of the CPC Tianshui Prefectural Committee in holding autumn sowing training classes is precisely in line with the spirit of this instruction from the CPC Central Committee. They taught farming techniques and the use of new agricultural tools suitable for local farmers based on the specific agricultural conditions of the region, summarized and exchanged the production experience of various farmers in the region, and initially criticized unscientific farming methods and erroneous ideas, so that the content of the training was closely combined with the actual situation of local agricultural production. This makes it possible for the results of the training to promote the improvement of farming techniques among the vast number of local peasants, which can avoid mechanical application and generalization.
    It is also appropriate for the party committee to lead and host this kind of training work. When we have basically completed various social reforms in the countryside, the central task of the Party in the countryside is to deeply lead agricultural production. At this time, it is absolutely necessary, just like leading social reform, to train a large number of cadres with certain agricultural production knowledge and technology and throw them into the agricultural production increase movement. The central task of the Party's grassroots organizations in the countryside must be clarified, and the leadership methods must be transformed to be able to adapt to the requirements of the vast number of peasants to increase production. All political work and other economic work in the countryside are inseparable from this central task. The Tianshui Prefectural Committee has grasped this center correctly.
    Although the Tianshui Prefectural Committee simultaneously transferred cadres for training within a special area, so the number of 872 people was a bit large, and the time of 20 days was still a bit long, which inevitably had some impact on rural production at that time, and the content of the lectures was not completely in line with the needs; however, these shortcomings are easy to prevent. In the future, training classes held in various places should generally be based on the county, and the time should be shortened as much as possible, the content of the explanation should be more practical for the local area, and the scope should not be too broad. From autumn this year to before spring plowing next year, all counties can, according to the specific situation, take out time and adopt appropriate methods to educate rural cadres on agricultural technical knowledge, and make the content of education closely integrated with the actual needs of local agricultural production, so as to prepare for spring plowing production next year, in order to strive to launch a agricultural production increase movement in the national rural areas in 1954.

    领导农业生产的一个重要方法
    近来在农村工作的干部和党政领导机关，对于农业生产的领导，遇到一个新的问题。这个问题就是：在国家进入有计划建设的时期，为了适应国家工业化的要求，为了适应广大农民在土地改革以后的生产力发展的要求，我们应该怎样加强具体领导，把农业生产水平提高一步呢？要解决这个问题，除了必须启发和引导农民群众自愿地组织起来，实行互助合作以外，同时还必须加强对农业生产技术等方面的具体领导。
    为了加强对农业生产的具体领导，许多地方的党政领导机关和模范干部采取了许多方法，来推广、指导和传授先进的农业技术，有不少成功的经验。最近中共天水地委在这一方面也创造了很好的经验，同样是值得各地学习的。
    中共天水地委在今年冬麦播种工作开始以前，利用农忙间隙，举办了秋播训练班，训练了大批县、区、乡干部和不脱离生产的干部，传授了农作技术，研究了增产经验，讲明了农村党支部领导生产的任务和方法。这个训练班收到了良好的效果，受训练的干部说：“这次回去领导生产有本钱了。”这个事实又一次证明，农村干部是迫切要求学会先进的农业技术和生产经验的。
    我们要把广大、分散的农民的耕作技术提高一步，普遍增加生产，这是一件大事。如果我们只依靠少数农业技术干部的力量，或者只注意少数丰产户的技术改进工作，那末，要达到普遍增产这个目的显然是很困难的。因此，我们十分需要采用开短期训练班等方式，对于广大农村工作干部，进行农业知识和技术的训练，使他们回到农村中去，能够比较普遍地随时指导一般的农民群众改进农业技术。这应该成为我们领导农业生产的一个重要方法。
    我们现有农业生产的技术条件是落后的，因此，改进农业技术的工作必须注意加强，特别是要注意对于一般农民群众的生产技术的指导。轻视和忽视这方面的工作是非常错误的。因为我们的国家正在进行第一个五年计划的建设，这就要求农业方面增产更多的粮食和工业原料。而要使农业方面普遍增产，除了必须大力发挥组织起来的力量以外，还必须努力改进农业生产技术，推广先进的农业生产经验。各地历年来都发现了不少丰产的农户，总结了一些丰产的经验，但是这些经验的推广还十分不够，除了少数丰产户以外，一般农民的耕作技术还很少改进。有的地方领导干部，总以为自己对于农业生产没有什么不懂得的，也以为农民对于农业生产都有一套本领，用不着太多操心。他们就这样主观地自以为是，不肯下苦工夫去研究增产的方法。这种情况必须迅速加以改变。
    必须看到，现在的农民群众对于过去老一套的耕作方法感到不满足的已经一天天多起来了。他们希望逐渐学会先进的耕作技术，以便提高生产水平，增加收获量。同时，从整个农业的发展情况来看，改进农业技术，推广先进的农业生产经验，已日益明显地成为进一步发展我国农业的一个重要关键了。在这时候，如果我们的农村工作干部不能根据当地的实际情况，掌握先进的农业生产经验和农业技术，就将不能完满地领导农民。
    当然，在注意改进农业技术的工作中，首先必须照顾到我国农业生产的具体情况，必须照顾到小农经济的条件，注意农民群众文化水平的低下、各地区的气候和土壤条件的不同，切不可盲目地机械地用一个简单的公式来推广农业技术。过去有些地方盲目推广新式步犁，既不问这些新农具对当地农民是否适用，又不教会他们使用的方法，以致有些新式步犁到了农民手里，只能成为“挂犁”，挂起不用；盲目提倡密植，也出现了“明密暗宽”的现象。这些无疑是必须纠正的。但是，根据各地具体条件，从实际出发，因地制宜，启发农村干部和农民群众的积极性来改进农业技术，却是完全必要的。
    我们应该完整地掌握中共中央今年三月十六日发出的“关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示”中关于改进农业技术的全面的精神。这个指示说：“在爱国增产运动中，有的地方只注意少数丰产的农民，忽视对一般农民生产的帮助和领导，这种毛病应该改正。在改进农业技术方面应当努力去做。但必须深刻认识农业的地域性与小农经济的分散性，切忌机械搬用不适合当地情况的所谓‘科学技术’与一般化地推行某些不适合地区特点的技术改进计划。”
    现在中共天水地委举办秋播训练班的经验，正是符合于中共中央这个指示的精神的。他们根据本地区农业的具体条件，讲授适合本地农民需要的耕作技术和新式农具的使用方法，总结和交流了本地区各种农户的生产经验，初步批判了不科学的耕作方法和错误思想，使训练的内容和当地农业生产的实际密切结合。这就使训练的结果有可能推动当地广大农民的耕作技术的改进，这就可以避免机械搬用和一般化的毛病。
    这种训练工作由党委来领导和举办也是适当的。当着我们在农村中基本上完成了各种社会改革之后，党在农村的中心任务就是要深入领导农业生产。这时候完全必须和领导社会改革一样，训练大批具有一定的农业生产知识和技术的干部，投到农业增产运动中去。党在农村的基层组织的中心任务必须明确起来，领导方法必须转变到能够适应于广大农民增产的要求。在农村中的一切政治工作和其他经济工作都与这个中心任务分不开。天水地委抓紧了这个中心是完全正确的。
    虽然，天水地委是在一个专区范围内同时抽调干部来进行训练，因而人数八百七十二人是多了一些，时间二十天也还是长了一些，对于当时的农村生产难免有一些影响，讲授内容也还不够完全切合需要；但是这些缺点是很容易防止的。今后各地举办这种训练班，一般地应以县为单位，时间要尽可能缩短，讲解内容要更切合当地实用，范围不要太广。今年秋后到明年春耕以前，各县都可以按照具体情况，抽出时间，采取适当方式，对农村干部进行农业技术知识的教育，并使教育内容密切结合当地农业生产的实际需要，为明年春耕生产做好准备，以便争取一九五四年在全国农村中开展一个农业增产的运动。
