The "Jinan First Regiment" of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Writes to All Workers of Anshan Iron and Steel, Congratulating Them on National Day
    The "Jinan First Regiment," a famous heroic unit of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, wrote to all workers of all units affiliated with Anshan Iron and Steel Company, congratulating them on National Day, hoping that workers and soldiers will jointly create greater victories in strengthening the country's economic and defense capabilities. The original text of the congratulatory letter is as follows:

    Dear worker comrades of Anshan Iron and Steel:

    As the fourth National Day of our great motherland arrives, all commanders and fighters of our "Jinan First Regiment" warmly congratulate you on the brilliant achievements you have made on the iron and steel industrial front of the motherland over the past four years, and extend our cordial greetings and lofty respect to you!

    This is our first correspondence. Although we have never met or shaken hands, our hearts have long been connected. We often search newspapers, periodicals, and pictorials for reports and pictures about your new creations, new achievements, and selfless labor. Every time we see these articles and pictures, we always read them over and over again, as if we can never get enough. Because from here, we see the worker brothers' high enthusiasm for loving the motherland and building the motherland, and we see the future of socialism and communism in our motherland. We very much like to know the deeds of labor models, such as the special-class labor model Li Feng'en, who used cold water to refresh himself when he was sleepy while studying technology day and night, and learned the ironmaking technology that the Japanese thought he would have to learn in eighteen years in just six months; and like the electric saw worker Jin Changming who created a new operating method and completed the planned seventy working days' task in six working days. These deeds, like the heroic deeds of the Volunteers, are being spread among us. When the large rolling mill has entered the completion stage, and the worker brothers are smearing cement and applying asphalt on the roof of the red factory building, when the seamless steel pipe plant has installed the last machine part and is conducting a comprehensive test run, we really hope that we can grow a pair of wings and immediately fly to the first "Steel Capital" of the motherland to see with our own eyes the great labor achievements of our worker brothers.

    Recently, we have also seen reports in the newspapers that "Anshan Iron and Steel production plants and mines have formulated plans to increase production and save 850 billion yuan throughout the year" and "Many plants and mines under Anshan Iron and Steel have completed and overfulfilled their August production plans." Your actions to increase production, practice thrift, and complete and overfulfill national plans for the motherland greatly encourage us. After seeing these news, the comrades of the "Jinan Hero Company" of our regiment conducted discussions in each class. Everyone said: We must learn from the worker brothers and complete our own tasks in the same way that the worker brothers complete their production plans.

    Our "Jinan First Regiment" has gradually grown up under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the long-term education of the Party. In the battle to liberate Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, under the correct command of our superiors and the cooperation of fraternal units, we completed the predetermined task and won this glorious title. We know that this honor belongs to the Party, belongs to the people, and belongs to all the comrades of the participating troops. We are determined to complete all the new tasks assigned by the Party and the people. Now, we are carrying out the glorious task of defending the national defense of the motherland and defending peace. We know that only by defending our national defense can the people of the whole country carry out production and construction peacefully and enable our motherland to steadily transition to a socialist society. Now, we assure you: We will definitely maintain our past honor, increase our vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen the national defense of the motherland, strengthen the regular training of the troops, and earnestly study Soviet military science, and strive to build our army into a regularized and modernized national defense force!

    Dear worker brothers, let us jointly create greater victories in the struggle to strengthen the country's economic and defense capabilities! We wish you good health! (Xinhua News Agency)

    中国人民解放军“济南第一团”写信给鞍钢全体工人祝贺国庆
    中国人民解放军某部著名的英雄部队“济南第一团”写信给鞍山钢铁公司所属各单位的全体工人祝贺国庆，希望工人和战士在加强祖国的经济力量和国防力量中共同创造更大的胜利。贺信原文如下：亲爱的鞍钢全体工人同志们：
    在我们伟大祖国第四届国庆节到来的时候，我们“济南第一团”全体指挥员、战斗员热烈地祝贺您们四年来在祖国钢铁工业战线上获得的光辉成就，并向您们致以亲切的慰问和崇高的敬礼！
    这是我们第一次通信。过去我们虽未见过面、握过手，可是我们的心早连在一起了，我们经常到报纸上、刊物上、画报上找寻关于你们工作上新的创造、新的成就和忘我劳动的报道和图片，我们每逢看到这些文章和图片时，总是看了一遍又一遍，好像没有个够。因为从这里，我们看到了工人兄弟们热爱祖国、建设祖国的高度热情，看到了我们祖国社会主义、共产主义的前途。我们非常喜欢知道劳动模范的事迹，像特等劳动模范李凤恩在日夜钻研技术中，困了就用冷水浇头提精神，在六个月内就学会了过去日本人认为他得十八年才能学会的炼铁技术；又像电锯工人金长明创造的新操作法，用六个工作日完成了原定七十个工作日的计划。这些事迹就像志愿军的英雄事迹一样，在我们这里传颂着。当大型轧钢厂已进入竣工阶段，工人兄弟们正在红色的厂房顶上抹水泥、涂沥青的时候，当无缝钢管厂安装好最后一个机器零件，进行全面试车的时候，我们真希望自己能长上一对翅膀，马上飞到祖国第一座“钢都”去，亲眼看一看我们工人兄弟伟大的劳动成绩。
    最近，我们又先后在报纸上看到了“鞍钢各生产厂矿订出计划、全年将增产节约八千五百亿元”和“鞍钢所属许多厂矿完成和超额完成八月份生产计划”的报道，您们这种为祖国增加生产、厉行节约、完成和超额完成国家计划的行动，大大鼓舞着我们，我团“济南英雄连”的同志们看了这些消息，各班都进行了讨论，大家都说：我们要向工人兄弟学习，像工人兄弟完成生产计划那样，完成我们自己的任务。
    我们“济南第一团”是在毛主席的英明领导和党的长期教养下，逐渐成长起来的。在解放山东省会济南的战役中，我们在上级首长的正确指挥和兄弟部队协同下，完成了预定的任务，获得了这个光荣称号。我们知道这荣誉是属于党的，属于人民的，属于全体参战部队同志们的。我们决心完成党和人民交给的各种新任务。现在，我们执行着保卫祖国国防、保卫和平的光荣任务。我们知道，只有保卫好我们祖国国防，才能使全国人民平平安安地进行生产建设，使我们祖国稳步地过渡到社会主义社会。现在，我们向您们保证：我们一定保持过去的荣誉，百倍地提高警惕，加强祖国国防，加强部队的正规训练，认真地学习苏联的军事科学，为努力建设我军成为正规化、现代化国防军而奋斗！
    亲爱的工人兄弟们，让我们在加强祖国经济力量和国防力量的斗争中，共同创造更大的胜利！祝您们身体健康！（新华社）
