Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 27th: U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Benson announced earlier this month that U.S. cotton production must be reduced because there is too much unsold cotton accumulated in public and private warehouses in the United States this year. Benson's specific plan is to reduce the cotton planting area by more than a quarter in the 1954 agricultural year. He also stated that if American farmers do not agree to reduce the planting area—although this reduction will directly reduce the income on which farmers depend for their livelihoods—then the U.S. government will cancel its support for cotton prices, reducing them by 44 percent.

Even many members of Congress have pointed out that implementing this plan would bankrupt many farmers. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's method of sacrificing the interests of small and medium-sized American farmers has aroused the dissatisfaction of the vast number of American farmers, who are angrily demanding Benson's resignation. The farmers' dissatisfaction with the Eisenhower administration's agricultural policy has developed to such an extent that when Benson spoke at a rally of tens of thousands of farmers in Wisconsin, the podium had to be tightly protected by wooden fences, barbed wire, and armed police.

At this time, U.S. President Eisenhower delivered a speech in the important agricultural area of the Midwestern United States on the 15th, boasting about "constructive legislative measures" to improve the agricultural situation. However, Eisenhower also had to admit that the war economy had created a "trouble" of overproduction in the U.S. agricultural economy. He explained this "trouble" by saying: "Agriculture, which has been inflated by the war, has in some respects produced more than the market demands."

According to materials announced by U.S. officials, the already large stockpiles of agricultural products such as cotton, wheat, and corn have further increased this year, but domestic and foreign sales have continued to shrink. The same is true for dairy products and other important agricultural products.

Some American bourgeois commentaries have tried to attribute the agricultural crisis to "too much" production, but the facts show that the fundamental reason for the large surplus of agricultural products is the reduction in people's consumption. Heavy taxes and rising living costs are constantly reducing people's purchasing power.

American agricultural monopoly capitalists manipulate the market, buying products from farmers at low prices on the one hand and selling them at high prices on the other, further deepening the contradiction between production and consumption that already exists. According to statistics, in 1952, the amount of food purchased by the American people was 6 percent less than in 1946. According to official U.S. figures, domestic cotton consumption in the United States in September this year decreased by nearly 5 percent compared to September last year, which also reflects the reduction in people's other basic consumption.

After the outbreak of the Korean War, due to the arbitrary increase in grain prices by American grain companies, retail grain prices rose by a total of 13.5 percent. The 28 largest grain processing companies in the United States relied on exploiting urban and rural consumers to increase their net profits in the first six months of this year by 21 percent compared to the first half of last year. However, the prices at which farmers sell their products to agricultural monopolies have continued to decline. According to the "Wall Street Journal," agricultural product prices have recently fallen by 18 percent compared to the beginning of 1951.

The income of American farmers has decreased, but the expenses necessary for their lives have continued to rise, which has made the lives of small and medium-sized American farmers more difficult. The "Wall Street Journal" reported that while agricultural product prices have fallen, the prices of consumer goods in mid-August this year were 15 percent higher than the 1947-49 level. In mid-September, the expenses of American farmers for paying interest on debts and paying taxes were 177 percent higher than the 1910-14 level. The newspaper admitted that under these circumstances, the current purchasing power of American farmers has fallen to its lowest level in twelve years. This is clearly reflected in the reduction in sales of agricultural implements. In August this year, the retail business of American agricultural implement companies has decreased by 32 percent compared to last year.

Another direct reason for the rapid development of the American agricultural surplus crisis is the reduction in exports. In the few years after the war, about one-third of American agricultural products were sold abroad because the rural economies of European and Asian capitalist countries were generally damaged by the war. With the recovery of production in other countries and the intensification of competition, this foreign market has been greatly reduced. The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced on the 19th that in the 1952-53 agricultural year, the total value of U.S. agricultural exports was 2.8 billion U.S. dollars, a decrease of 30 percent from the previous year, reaching the lowest level since the war. Among them, cotton exports decreased by 50 percent, wheat and flour exports decreased by 33 percent, lard exports decreased by 33 percent, and tobacco exports decreased by 16 percent.

### 美国的农产品很难销售农业危机加深

    美国的农产品很难销售农业危机加深
    【新华社二十七日讯】华盛顿消息：美国农业部长本逊在本月初宣布：由于美国今年积压在公私仓库里的卖不出去的棉花太多，美国的棉花生产必须减少。本逊的具体办法是，在一九五四农业年度把棉花的种植面积减缩四分之一以上。他并且表示，如果美国农民不同意缩减种植面积——虽然这种缩减将直接减少农民赖以为生的收入——，那么美国政府就要取消对棉花价格的支持，使之降低百分之四十四。
    甚至许多国会议员都指出，实行这种计划，会使许多农民陷于破产。美国农业部这个牺牲美国中小农民利益的办法，激起了美国广大农民的不满，他们愤怒地要求本逊辞职。农民们对艾森豪威尔政府农业政策的不满已发展到了这样的程度，以至于本逊在威斯康星州一次数万农民大会上讲话时，需要用木栅、铁丝网及武装警察把讲台紧紧保护起来。
    就在这个时候，美国总统艾森豪威尔十五日在美国中西部重要农业地区发表演说，竟大吹其什么改善农业情况的“建设性立法措施”。但是艾森豪威尔同时也不得不承认：战争经济造成了美国农业经济中存在着的生产过剩的“麻烦”。他解释这个“麻烦”说：“由于战争而膨胀了的农业，在某些方面，生产超过了市场的需求。”
    据美国官方宣布的材料，棉花、小麦、玉蜀黍等本来已有大量积存的农产品今年进一步增加，但国内外的销路却不断缩小。乳制品和其他重要农产品也是一样。
    美国的一些资产阶级言论力图把农业的危机归因于生产“太多”，但事实说明，农产品大量过剩的根本原因是人民消费量的减少。沉重的捐税和高涨的生活费使得人民的购买力不断降低。
    美国的农业垄断资本家操纵市场，一方面以低价向农民收购产品，另一方面以高价出售，更加深了本来已经存在的生产与消费之间的矛盾。据统计，在一九五二年，美国人民购买食品的数量比一九四六年减少了百分之六。据美国官方数字，在今年九月份，美国国内的棉花消费量比去年九月减少了近百分之五，这同样也反映了人民其他基本消费的减少。
    朝鲜战争爆发后，由于美国的粮食公司肆意抬高粮价，粮食的零售价格一共上涨了百分之十三·五。美国二十八家最大的粮食加工公司靠着剥削城乡消费者，在今年头六个月的纯利润比去年上半年增加了百分之二十一。但是农民向农业垄断资本出卖产品的价格却不断下降。据“华尔街日报”报道，与一九五一年年初比较，农产品价格最近已下跌了百分之十八。
    美国农民的收入减少了，但是他们生活必需的费用却不断高涨，这就使美国中小农民生活更加困难。“华尔街日报”报道，与农产品跌价的同时，消费品的价格在今年八月中旬比一九四七—四九年的水平上涨了百分之十五，在九月中旬，美国农民用在偿付债务利息与交纳税款等费用，比一九一零—一四年的水平高百分之一百七十七。该报承认，在这种情况下，目前美国农民购买力已经降至十二年来的最低水平。这明显地反映在农具销售量的减少上。在今年八月，美国农具公司的零售生意已经比去年减少了百分之三十二。
    美国农业生产过剩危机迅速发展的另外一个直接的原因是出口的减少。战后几年中间，由于欧亚资本主义国家农村经济普遍遭到大战的破坏，美国农产品曾经约有三分之一行销国外。随着其他国家生产的恢复和竞争的加剧，这种国外市场已大大缩小了。美国农业部十九日宣布，在一九五二—五三农业年度，美国农产品的出口总额为二十八亿美元，比上一年减少了百分之三十，达到战后最低水平。其中棉花的出口减少了百分之五十，小麦与面粉的出口减少百分之三十三，猪油的出口减少百分之三十三，烟草的出口减少百分之十六。
