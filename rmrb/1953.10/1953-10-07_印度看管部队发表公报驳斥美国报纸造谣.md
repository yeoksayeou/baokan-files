Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 5th: The Indian Custodial Forces, in an official communiqué on October 4th, exposed the lies of American newspapers deliberately distorting the activities of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC). American newspapers have recently disseminated extremely childish lies and distortions in their propaganda, attempting to conceal the fact that over a hundred prisoners of war, purportedly "preferring suicide to repatriation" according to the American side, have requested repatriation.

The first instance of American newspapers distorting facts cited in the Indian Custodial Forces' communiqué is a United Press photograph published in the Korean news section of the U.S. Army's official newspaper "Pacific Stars and Stripes" on September 30th. The communiqué pointed out: "The caption accompanying this photograph gives the impression that the Indian Custodial Forces, against the will of a prisoner of war, forcibly carried him to the receiving station of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers."

The communiqué further stated: "The fact is that the prisoner of war in the photograph was too emotionally agitated and exhausted, so he had to be helped by Indian guards to the receiving station of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers." At the time, over a hundred people, including observer representatives of the NNRC, Indian officers, and journalists, witnessed the wounded prisoner of war with bandages being helped by Indian guards into the reception station in Panmunjom.

The communiqué continued: "The Indian Custodial Forces regret that a responsible newspaper like 'Stars and Stripes' would attach such a factually distorted caption to this photograph of a Chinese prisoner of war—one of the sixty-five prisoners of war who, having requested repatriation and been approved, were handed over to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers at Panmunjom on September 27th."

Other news distorted by American newspapers concerned the repatriation of Wang Xu, a captured member of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Wang Xu had served as a translator for American officers and intelligence chiefs. Fearing that Wang Xu would expose their conspiracies to sabotage the explanatory work to the world, the Americans and their agents attempted to get him back at all costs. On September 25th, American agents staged a demonstration, holding Indian officers hostage. American newspapers, however, reported: "The main reason for the disturbance was the increasing dissatisfaction of the prisoners of war with the blankets and rations distributed to them." The communiqué refuted this fabrication, stating: "The news published by American newspapers that Wang Xu did not genuinely request repatriation and that he left the camp solely to appeal against dissatisfaction with the blankets and food distributed to the prisoners of war is absolutely untrue." The communiqué added that the distribution of blankets to the prisoners of war was completed on September 24th, the day before the disturbance, and that the prisoners of war had been receiving normal food supplies.

The communiqué pointed out: "Wang Xu requested to return to China. According to the procedure for repatriating prisoners of war, Wang Xu was taken to the NNRC's Approval Committee. This committee had five representatives, one from each member state participating in the NNRC. Wang Xu firmly expressed to the Approval Committee his request to return to China. His request was recorded and approved by all the representatives. Only then was Wang Xu granted repatriation."

    印度看管部队发表公报驳斥美国报纸造谣
    【新华社开城五日电】印度看管部队十月四日在正式公报中揭穿了美国报纸故意歪曲中立国遣返委员会的活动的谎话。美国报纸最近在宣传中散播了极端幼稚的谎话和曲解，企图借此掩蔽这样一个事实：已有一百余名据美方说是“宁可自杀也不愿遣返”的战俘要求遣返了。
    印度看管部队公报所列举的第一个美国报纸歪曲事实的实例是：九月三十日的美国陆军的官方报纸“太平洋星条报”朝鲜新闻版中所登载的一幅合众社的照片。公报指出：“这幅照片所附的说明使人得到这样的印象，就是印度看管部队违反一名战俘的意愿，强把他抬到朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的接收站去。”
    公报又说：“事实却是：照片中的这名战俘感情太激动并且困顿不堪，所以必得由印度警卫帮助他到朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的接收站去。”当时有中立国遣返委员会的观察代表、印度军官和记者共百余人，目睹这名扎着绷带的受伤的战俘在印度警卫的帮助下进入板门店的接收站。
    公报继续说：“印度看管部队对于像‘星条报’这样负责的报纸竟会在这幅关于一名中国战俘——他是在提出遣返请求以后经过批准并在九月二十七日在板门店移交给朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的六十五名战俘中的一个——的照片下标上了这样歪曲事实的说明一事，感到遗憾。”
    美国报纸加以歪曲的其他消息是关于中国人民志愿军被俘人员王旭的遣返的消息。王旭曾当过美国军官和特务头子的翻译，美国人和他们的特务担心王旭会向全世界揭露他们破坏解释工作的阴谋，因此企图不惜一切代价把他弄回去。美方特务就在九月二十五日举行示威，把印度军官作为人质扣押起来。美国报纸却报道说：“骚动的主要原因是因为战俘对于分发给他们的毯子和口粮越来越感到不满”。公报批驳了这种造谣。公报说：“美国报纸发表的消息说，王旭并没有真正要求遣返，他从营场里出来完全是想申诉对于分发给战俘的毯子和食物一事所怀的不满。这个消息是绝对不确的”。公报又说：把毯子分发给战俘的工作是在九月二十四日即发生骚动的前一天完成的，而且战俘一直得到正常的食物供应。
    公报指出：“王旭要求回到中国去。按照遣返战俘的程序，王旭就被带到中立国遣返委员会批准委员会去。这个委员会有五位代表，每一个参加中立国遣返委员会的委员国各派代表一人。王旭向批准委员会断然表示他要求回到中国去。他的要求被记录下来，并得到各位代表的批准。然后王旭才获得遣返。”
