Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 20th: The US side recently fabricated lies, insisting that the actual number of personnel from the Korean-Chinese side entering the Indian Custodial Forces camp exceeded the pre-determined number. Subsequently, Hamblen, the head of the US side's so-called "Repatriation" Group, wrote to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 19th, threateningly claiming that he would "strictly control the checkpoints on the military demarcation line." This proves that the US side's purpose in fabricating this lie is to create an excuse to delay and obstruct the explanatory work by controlling traffic. Deliberately obstructing the entry and exit of the Korean-Chinese side's explanation representatives and other staff members to and from the explanation site has always been part of the US side's plan to sabotage the explanation work. The US side initially attempted to force Korean-Chinese personnel to detour through US military-controlled areas when entering and exiting the explanation site. Only under the repeated and firm demands of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission did the US side build a road from the military demarcation line to the Indian Custodial Forces camp in Dongchang-ri. Due to the needs of fulfilling its mission, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission once suggested to the US side that necessary adjustments be made to the Indian Custodial Forces area to include this section of the road within the custodial area, but this suggestion was rejected by the US side. The US side established a checkpoint at the entrance to the Indian Custodial Forces camp on this road. The number of people from the Korean-Chinese side entering the explanation site in Dongchang-ri each day is the number agreed upon by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and after the personnel of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission check the passes at the US checkpoint at the designated time, they enter the explanation site. Hamblen's unfounded threat is clearly an attempt to interfere with the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in order to realize the US side's conspiracy to obstruct the movement of Korean-Chinese personnel.
    Paragraph 3(c) of the Temporary Supplementary Agreement to the Armistice Agreement clearly stipulates that the explanation representatives of both sides, the observation representatives of both sides, and the necessary materials and equipment, have complete freedom of entry and exit and movement within the prisoner-of-war camps designated by each side. General Li Sang-cho, the chief commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, stated on the 14th that the Korean-Chinese side will not tolerate any interference with the freedom of movement of our explanation representatives and other staff members in the demilitarized zone.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 20th: Our captured personnel who returned after explanation said that the US agents sent to the prisoners of war revealed that the US side had concentrated relevant personnel and a group of Chiang Kai-shek agents in the US delegation camp in Munsan to conduct training in sabotaging the explanation work. The US side decided that during the "observation" of the explanation work, the "observation representatives" would be American personnel, while the Chiang Kai-shek agents would appear as "detaining party representatives" or "interpreters." During the explanation work, they would create various excuses, either the American "observation representatives" would obstruct the explanation work, or the Chiang Kai-shek agents acting as "detaining party representatives" would make loud noises and disturbances in Chinese in order to threaten the prisoners of war and prevent them from expressing their desire to be repatriated. The US side also decided that if these disturbances were ineffective, these "representatives" and "interpreters" from the US side would withdraw from the explanation site altogether to sabotage the explanation. The explanation work of the past few days has proved that the US side is wantonly violating the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits" formulated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and implementing its pre-planned conspiracy to sabotage the explanation work.

### 美方制造藉口企图阻难我方解释人员行动

    美方制造藉口企图阻难我方解释人员行动
    【新华社开城二十日电】美方最近捏造谎言，硬说朝中方面进入印度看管部队营地的人员的实际人数多于预定的人数。接着，美方所谓“遣返”组组长汉布伦在十九日写信给中立国遣返委员会，威胁地声称要“严格地控制军事分界线上的检查站”。这证明美方捏造这个谎言的目的，就是为了制造藉口，便于利用控制交通来拖延时间阻挠解释工作。对朝中方面的解释代表和其他工作人员在出入解释场所时故意加以阻挠，这一直是美方破坏解释工作的计划的一部分。美方最初企图使朝中方面人员在出入解释场所时，必须绕道美方军事控制地区，只是在中立国遣返委员会的一再坚决要求下，美方才修筑了一条从军事分界线通向东场里印度看管部队营地的公路。中立国遣返委员会由于执行任务的需要，曾经向美方建议：对印度看管部队地区进行必要的调整，把这一段公路包括在看管地区内，但是这个建议遭到了美方的拒绝。美方在这条公路上的印度看管部队营地入口处设立了一个检查站。朝中方面每日进入东场里解释场所的人数，都是为中立国遣返委员会同意的数目，并在指定时间由中立国遣返委员会人员在美方检查站点验通行证以后进入解释场所。汉布伦的无中生有的威胁，显然是企图干涉中立国遣返委员会的工作，以便实现美方阻难朝中方面人员行动的阴谋。
    停战协定的临时补充协议第三条丙款明确地规定：双方解释代表、双方观察代表以及所需的物资装备，有出入及在双方各自指定的战俘看管地点内移动的完全自由。军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军在十四日即已声明，朝中方面将不容忍对我方解释代表及其他工作人员在非军事区内行动自由的任何干扰。
    【新华社开城二十日电】经解释后归来的我方被俘人员说：美方派到战俘中的特务分子透露，美方曾在汶山美方代表团营地，集中有关人员和一批蒋介石特务，进行破坏解释工作的训练。美方决定在“观察”解释工作时，“观察代表”由美国人员担任，蒋介石特务则以“拘留方代表”或“翻译”    身份出现。在解释工作进行时，他们要制造种种藉口，或者由美国“观察代表”阻挠解释工作的进行，或者由担任“拘留方代表”的蒋介石特务用中国话高声吵闹和捣乱，以便威胁战俘，使他们不敢表示要求遣返的意愿。美方并决定，如果这些捣乱行为无效，美方的这些“代表”、“翻译”就以全部退出解释场所来破坏解释。过去几天的解释工作，已证明美方正蛮横地违反中立国遣返委员会拟定的“解释和访问工作细则”，实施它预定的破坏解释工作的阴谋。
