    The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Seriously Examines and Corrects Deviations in the Implementation of Ethnic Policies

    Over the past three years, Guizhou Province has achieved great successes in the implementation of ethnic policies, but many errors and shortcomings have also occurred. These errors and shortcomings were examined and exposed at a special meeting convened by the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in January of this year. Most of them have been corrected, or are in the process of being corrected.

    Guizhou is a province with a diverse population of ethnic minorities. There are more than 3.6 million ethnic minorities in the province, accounting for about 25 percent of the total population. The Miao, Buyi (Zhongjia), Dong, and Yi ethnic groups are the most numerous. Except for Daozhen, Yuping, Dejiang, Sinan, Yanhe, and Yinjiang counties, all the other 70-plus counties and Guiyang city have ethnic minority communities or mixed residence areas. Since liberation, ethnic relations have undergone fundamental changes. Thanks to the implementation of Chairman Mao's ethnic policies by governments at all levels, a new ethnic relationship of equality, mutual respect, mutual assistance, and common development has been fundamentally established. With the voluntary participation and at the request of the ethnic minority people, land reform has been implemented throughout the province and has now been basically completed. The people's awareness has been raised and their living standards have improved. Four ethnic autonomous counties, eight ethnic autonomous districts, and five special districts, twenty-eight counties, three districts, and four towns with ethnic democratic united governments have been established throughout the province, and more than 7,000 ethnic minority cadres have participated in the work. The patriotism of the ethnic minority people has risen to unprecedented heights. They have actively participated in various patriotic movements. In particular, during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the ethnic minority people contributed their utmost support, and many young people enthusiastically joined the Chinese People's Volunteers. The economic and trade departments have vigorously carried out trade work with ethnic minorities, and the lives of the ethnic minority people have gradually improved. There are now 94 ethnic minority primary schools with 137,698 students and 10 ethnic minority middle schools with 4,550 students in the province. Thirty-eight ethnic minority district health centers, seven provincial and special district ethnic minority mobile health work teams, and seven mobile medical teams have been established throughout the province. More than 60 county hospitals in the province have implemented free medical care for ethnic minorities and have trained 2,433 ethnic minority health workers.

    However, in the past three years, many areas have experienced serious deviations in violation of ethnic policies. According to the instructions of the Central Committee, the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conducted a key inspection in the province last November and found the following main problems:

    First, there was a lack of respect for the customs and habits of ethnic minorities. Although most cadres are very enthusiastic in their work and have good subjective intentions, they do not have a sufficient understanding of ethnic characteristics and do not regard respect for the customs and habits of ethnic minorities as an important ethnic policy, but rather as "lifestyle details" or "backwardness of the masses." As a result, many instances of disrespect for the customs and habits of ethnic minorities have occurred, demonstrating a serious Han chauvinistic style. For example, some cadres did not allow ethnic minorities to use their own languages and demanded that they speak "Kehua" (Han language). Some promoted "haircuts and clothing changes." In Weining County, women cadres in the sixth district even cut off the braids of two ethnic minority women at a public meeting. They said that wearing Han clothes and speaking "Kehua" was progress, which caused dissatisfaction among the ethnic minority masses. Some cadres rigidly prohibited ethnic minority sacrifices and "eating Gu Zang" (a grand festival of the Miao ethnic group, held every seven or eight years, or every ten or twenty years. Each time "Gu Zang" is eaten, a township has to slaughter twenty or thirty cattle or more). During the land reform, a cadre in Sandu County burned all the several large boxes of Shui ethnic script used for sacrifices. In Taikang, Longli, Anlong and other counties some cadres destroyed temples, and cut down "sacred trees". Some cadres violated ethnic minority marriage customs and interfered with ethnic minority young men and women's "Yao Malang" (Miao ethnic group), "Gan Biao" (Buyi ethnic group), and "Xingge Zuoyue" (Dong ethnic group) (the above are all ways for young ethnic minority men and women to gather for singing and dancing to find love), considering that Muslims going to mosques for worship was "backward." Zhang Chuanming, a cadre in Wanzhai Township, Longli County, said: "People who play Malang cannot join the Communist Party"; and stipulated at the Youth League swearing-in ceremony: "Those who join the Youth League are not allowed to play Malang." Of course, it is right and necessary to patiently persuade the ethnic minorities to pay attention to thrift and avoid waste in their activities such as "eating Gu Zang" and "Yao Malang," and not to delay production, but it should never be rigidly prohibited or interfered with.

    Secondly, some cadres obliterated the characteristics of ethnic minority areas and mechanically applied the work experience of Han areas. For example, during the land reform, some areas did not conscientiously implement the policy of carrying out land reform in ethnic minority areas, and in the distribution of fruits and the requisition of land, they requisitioned ethnic minority sacrificial fields, "sacred mountains," "bullfighting grounds," and "Malang slopes."

    The most serious problem in the land reform was that some areas deliberately assigned less land, poor land, or even no land to ethnic minorities.

    Third, some Han cadres did not actively cultivate and specifically help ethnic minority cadres, but instead took over their work and even discriminated against them, so that ethnic minority cadres had positions but no power. An armed cadre in the eighth district of the Huihui Yi and Miao Autonomous Region in Huishui County once said to the Yi deputy district chief in person: "You are not qualified to manage me!" Individual Han cadres in some areas are still dissatisfied with the promotion of ethnic minority cadres. All these have affected ethnic unity and the development of work.

    The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a strict criticism of the above-mentioned deviations at a special meeting held in January of this year, pointing out that the reasons for these deviations were mainly that cadres did not seriously study ethnic policies and did not understand the characteristics and importance of ethnic work. At the same time, it was pointed out that leaders at all levels did not pay enough attention to ethnic work, lacked education and help to cadres, and did not correct the deviations in time. Therefore, the meeting decided that all parts of the province should universally check the implementation of ethnic policies and quickly correct deviations; Party committees at all levels must strengthen their leadership over ethnic work. In areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities and in all areas where ethnic minorities live, it is now necessary to earnestly publicize ethnic policies, conduct regular in-depth inspections, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner. Policy education should be strengthened for Han cadres to thoroughly eliminate the residual thinking of Han chauvinism; and the quality of cadres should be improved. Han cadres working in ethnic minority areas should learn ethnic minority languages, respect ethnic minority customs and habits, and establish the idea of ​​working in ethnic minority areas for a long time. The cultivation of ethnic minority cadres should be strengthened, and specific assistance should be given to them to improve their policy level and professional level. Ethnic minority cadres should be trained in rotation by the ethnic institutes in a planned way. In the future, the system of requesting instructions and reporting must be strictly implemented for all measures related to ethnic minorities, and organization and discipline must be strengthened.

    After this meeting, the broad masses of cadres have generally paid attention to ethnic work. Party committees at all levels have organized cadres to study ethnic policies and have effectively corrected various deviations and dealt with related issues. Up to now, more than 50 counties have earnestly checked the implementation of ethnic policies. Through study and inspection, the policy level of cadres has been improved and work has been improved, thus laying a foundation for further improving ethnic work in the future.

    中共贵州省委员会
    认真检查和纠正执行民族政策中的偏差
    三年多来，贵州省在执行民族政策方面获得很大成绩，但也发生过不少错误和缺点。对这些错误和缺点，在今年一月中共贵州省委召开的专门会议上检查揭发后，大部分已得到纠正，或正在纠正。
    贵州是一个多民族的省份。全省少数民族共有三百六十余万人，约占全省总人口百分之二十五。其中以苗族、布依族（仲家）、侗族、彝族较多。全省除道真、玉屏、德江、思南、沿河、印江等六县外，其余七十余县及贵阳市都有少数民族聚居或杂居区。解放后，民族关系已经起了基本的变化，由于各级人民政府执行了毛主席的民族政策，新的民族平等、互相尊重、互助友爱、共同发展的民族关系已基本建立起来。在少数民族人民的自愿与要求下，全省实行了土地改革，目前已基本完成。人民觉悟提高，生活也得到改善。全省建立了四个县、八个区的民族自治区和五个专区、二十八个县、三个区、四个镇的民族民主联合政府，有七千多名少数民族干部参加了工作。少数民族人民的爱国主义空前高涨，积极参加了各种爱国运动，特别在抗美援朝运动中，少数民族人民尽了自己最大的支援力量，许多青年踊跃参加了中国人民志愿军。经济贸易部门，大力开展了少数民族贸易工作，使少数民族人民的生活逐步上升。全省现有民族小学九十四所、学生十三万七千六百九十八人，民族中学十所、学生四千五百五十多人。全省已建立少数民族区卫生所三十八所，省及专区民族巡回卫生工作队七队，巡回医疗组七组，全省六十多个县卫生院都实行了少数民族免费医疗，并培养了少数民族卫生人员二千四百三十三人。
    但是，三年多来有不少地区曾发生了许多违犯民族政策的严重偏向。根据中央的指示，中共贵州省委去年十一月份在全省重点检查的结果，发现主要有以下一些问题。
    首先是不尊重少数民族的风俗习惯。一般干部虽然工作热情很高，主观愿望也好，但是对民族特点认识不足，没有把尊重少数民族风俗习惯，当作一项重要的民族政策，而认为是“生活细节”或“群众落后”，因而不尊重少数民族风俗习惯的事例发生了很多，表现了严重的大汉族主义的作风。如有的干部曾不让少数民族使用本民族语言，要他们说
    “客话”（汉话）；有的提倡“剪发改装”，威宁县六区妇女干部竟在大会上剪了两个少数民族妇女的发辫；他们说穿汉衣、说“客话”是进步，引起少数民族群众不满。有的干部硬性禁止少数民族祭祀、“吃牯脏”（是苗族的一个盛节，有的七八年举行一次，有的十几年举行一次，每吃一次“牯脏”，一个乡要杀二三十条牛不等）。三都县一个干部在土地改革时将水家族祭祀用的几大箱水文书全部烧毁。台江、龙里、安龙等县有的干部打神破庙、砍伐“神树”。有的干部违反少数民族婚姻习惯，干涉少数民族青年男女“摇马郎”（苗族）、“赶裱”（布依族）、“行歌坐月”（侗族）（以上都是少数民族男女青年聚会歌舞进行恋爱的方式），认为回民上清真寺礼拜是“落后”。龙里县弯寨乡干部张传明说：“玩马郎的人不能参加共产党”；并在入团宣誓大会上规定：“参加青年团就不准玩马郎”。当然，对于少数民族中的“吃牯脏”、“摇马郎”等活动，耐心地说服他们注意节约，避免浪费，并不要耽误生产是应该的也是必要的，但决不应硬性地禁止和干涉。
    其次是有些干部抹煞民族地区的特点，机械搬用汉人地区的工作经验，譬如在土地改革时，有的地区没有认真贯彻在少数民族地区进行土地改革的政策，在分配果实和征收土地中征收了少数民族的祭祀田、“神山”、“打牛场”、“马郎坡”等。
    在土地改革中最为严重的则是若干地区故意给少数民族少分田，分坏田，甚至不分田。
    第三、有些汉族干部对少数民族干部积极培养和具体帮助不够，工作中包办代替，甚至歧视少数民族干部，使少数民族干部有职无权。惠水彝族、苗族自治区第八区一个武装干部曾当面对彝族副区长说：“你不够资格管我！”个别地区的汉族干部对提拔少数民族干部还有不满情绪。这些都影响了民族团结和工作的开展。
    对于上述偏向，中共贵州省委在今年一月份召开的专门会议上作了严格的批判，指出发生这些偏向的原因，主要是干部没有认真学习民族政策，不懂得民族工作的特点及重要性。同时指出各级领导对民族工作重视不够，对干部缺乏教育和帮助，且没有及时纠正偏向。因此，会议确定全省各地要普遍检查执行民族政策情况，迅速纠正偏差；各级党委必须加强对民族工作的领导，在少数民族聚居地区以及凡有少数民族的地区，今后均必须认真宣传民族政策，经常深入检查，及时发现问题，解决问题。对汉族干部要加强政策教育，彻底肃清大汉族主义的残余思想；提高干部质量。在少数民族地区工作的汉族干部要学习少数民族语言，尊重少数民族风俗习惯，树立在少数民族地区长期工作的思想。对少数民族干部应加强培养，具体帮助他们提高政策水平和业务水平，民族学院应有计划地轮训少数民族干部。今后对有关少数民族的各项措施，应严格执行请示报告制度，加强组织性和纪律性。
    经过这次会议，广大干部对民族工作已普遍引起注意。各级党委都组织干部学习民族政策，并切实纠正了各种偏差，处理了有关的问题。截至目前，已有五十多个县认真检查了执行民族政策情况。经过学习和检查，提高了干部的政策水平，改进了工作，从而为今后进一步作好民族工作打下了基础。
