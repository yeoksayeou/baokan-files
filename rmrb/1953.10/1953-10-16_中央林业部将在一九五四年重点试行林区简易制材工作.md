    Central Forestry Department to Focus on Piloting Simple Timber Processing in Forest Areas in 1954
    Letter from the Central Forestry Department: The "Reader's Letters Summary" column published on August 17, with the title "Promoting Simple Timber Processing in Forest Areas," put forward a very good suggestion for the rational use of forest resources and saving the country's transportation capacity. This issue was studied at the planning meeting held by the Northeast Forest Industry Administration in July this year, and this direction was determined. We will focus on piloting it in 1954.

    中央林业部将在一九五四年重点试行林区简易制材工作
    中央林业部来信：八月十七日“读者来信摘要”栏发表了以“推行林区简易制材的工作”为题的“读者来信述评”，对合理使用森林资源与节省国家的运输能力提出了一个很好的建议。今年七月，东北森林工业管理局召开的计划会议，曾对这个问题进行了研究，并确定了这个方向。一九五四年我们将重点试行。
