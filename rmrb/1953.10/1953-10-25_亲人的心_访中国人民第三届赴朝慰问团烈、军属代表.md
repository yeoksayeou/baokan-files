    The Hearts of Loved Ones
    —An Interview with Representatives of Martyrs' and Military Dependents in the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea
    Yu Li
    In the glorious ranks of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, the representatives of the martyrs' and military dependents of the Volunteer Army are particularly respected. Among them are many fathers, mothers, and wives of nationally known heroes. They come from all over the country, bringing the flesh-and-blood feelings of millions of parents, wives, and brothers to the Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, bringing millions of hearts of loved ones.
    Luo Diekai, the father of the great internationalist fighter Martyr Luo Shengjiao, has received more than two thousand letters, all written to him by the Korean people and the Volunteer Army. In the letters, many people affectionately call him "Dad" and ask to be his sons and daughters. The local government of Korea, where Martyr Luo Shengjiao's tomb is located, wrote to him, telling him that during festivals, the Korean people come to the martyr's tomb to pay their respects. Every day, Korean girls offer fresh flowers at the tomb. "The Korean people are so good to my son," Luo Diekai said emotionally. "This time I am going to Korea to solemnly thank them for their kindness and tell them: I, and the entire Chinese people, are determined to support them!"
    Liu Guixiang is a young rural woman, a member of the Communist Youth League, a representative of the village women, the director of the township women's federation, a member of the district women's federation, and a model military dependent in the province. She is from Jiajiazhuangzi Village in Changle County, Shandong Province. In 1951, she sent her husband, Zhong Xuexin, to join the Volunteer Army. Last year, when the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea was in Korea, a patriotic woman from Hamhung City, Hamgyongnam-do, who had sent her husband to join the army, gave the delegation a silver ring and asked them to bring it back and give it to a patriotic sister in China. Now, this silver ring is on Liu Guixiang's finger. The city of Hamhung in Korea and Changle County in China are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, but this silver ring has connected their hearts, and also connected the millions of hearts of wives and mothers of China and Korea.
    These relatives of heroes will bring the Chinese people's support and gratitude to their heroic sons and daughters and to the heroic Korean people. Liu Laidi, a Red Army martyr's dependent and glorious mother of Volunteer Army soldiers from the old revolutionary base area of Ruijin, Jiangxi, was seen off by the people of two townships when she left. They asked her to tell the Korean people: "We are the people of Ruijin, Jiangxi, the old revolutionary base area of China. We suffered the cruel slaughter of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, and we deeply understand the suffering you are experiencing today. The knives of the reactionaries cut into you as if they were cutting into our hearts. We will definitely do our best to support you in recovering from the wounds of war and rebuilding a peaceful life." Luo Mengshan, the mother of Volunteer Army combat hero Zeng Nansheng, is the director of the Martyrs' and Military Dependents Committee in Changsha City, Hunan Province. When she came, many martyrs' and military dependents came to see her and asked her to tell their children in Korea: they will definitely respond to Chairman Mao's call, work hard in production, reduce the government's burden, and better support you. Gao Guizhen, the fiancée of Volunteer Army soldier Dong Shigui, was told by all the members of the Communist Youth League in her village (Henan Village, Shunyi County, Hebei Province) when she left, to tell the Volunteer Army: "Each of us weighs one hundred and twenty pounds, and we work like little oxen. We are ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and stand up to be your backing."
    The glorious representatives of the martyrs' and military dependents will also tell their relatives how the government and the people care for and respect them, and about their good life after liberation. Martyr Luo Shengjiao's family lacked labor and had some difficulties in life. The government provided his family with 2,670 catties of grain as preferential treatment. This year, the land cultivated for him by the masses can yield more than 3,000 catties of grain. The Tianjin County People's Government helped Martyr Yang Lian's family build six large tiled houses and gave his family a loan to buy a mule and a waterwheel. This year, his family's corn grew more than a person tall, and the whole family made new clothes. The life of Dong Shigui, Gao Guizhen's fiancé, has also been greatly improved, and they can often eat rice or white flour. When Volunteer Army soldier Zhong Xuexin left home, his family had no livestock, and the granary for storing grain was less than half a person high. His wife Liu Guixiang's cotton-padded jacket still had patches, and there was only one pig in the entire township. Now, his family has bought a donkey and a cow and raised seven pigs. The granary for storing grain is taller than Liu Guixiang. There are one hundred and seventy or eighty pigs in one village! Liu Guixiang is wearing three layers of new clothes inside and out. The girls in the village stayed up all night with the lights on to rush to sew new cotton-padded jackets, new cotton-padded trousers, and new cotton-padded quilts for her before she left.
    The glorious representatives of the martyrs' and military dependents also brought their own glory to meet their relatives. Liu Yushun, the father of Liu Xingwen, a Miao youth combat hero from the mountainous area of Guizhou, is a production model. After Liu Laidi, a Red Army martyr's dependent, sent two sons to join the army, she took the lead in production at home and was elected a provincial labor model. The government awarded her a large draft cattle, cloth, and clothes. After Tian Wenfu, a machine gun shooter of the Volunteer Army, became a combat hero, his wife Gan Yuzhen thought: "It is an honor for him to be a combat hero, and I must also strive for honor to be worthy of him." Her family's fields were all cultivated by her, her father-in-law, and her mother-in-law. She often walked fifteen miles up the mountain to the city with her mother-in-law to carry manure, carrying more than one hundred catties at a time. Five thousand catties of green fertilizer were applied per mu, and the crops had large ears and plump grains. Everyone praised her as a good hand at labor. In 1951, she was elected as a county labor model. In 1952, she attended the labor model conference in Xikang Province. In May of last year, she joined the Communist Youth League and became the secretary of the township Communist Youth League branch. In July of this year, she gloriously joined the Party. During the general election, the whole township elected her as a township people's representative and a county people's representative. The glorious girl Gao Guizhen helped her fiancé Dong Shigui's family with farming and was elected as a district, county, and provincial model of preferential treatment and labor model three times. She attended the Second National Women's Congress and met Chairman Mao. How glorious are these good mothers, good wives, and fiancées of the Volunteer Army soldiers! They have all striven for glorious status with their exemplary actions, making them worthy of being relatives of the heroes fighting in Korea, adding more glory to the glorious laurel wreath of the Volunteer Army heroes!

    亲人的心
    ——访中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团烈、军属代表
    余力
    在中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团的光荣行列里，志愿军烈、军属的代表，特别受人尊敬。他们中间有着许多全国知名的英雄的父亲、母亲和妻子。他们来自祖国各地，带来了千万父母、妻子、兄弟对志愿军和朝鲜人民军血肉相连的感情，带来了千万颗亲人的心。
    伟大的国际主义战士罗盛教烈士的父亲罗迭开，曾经接到过两千多封信，这些信，都是朝鲜人民和志愿军写给他的。在信中，许多人都亲热地喊他爸爸，要求做他的儿女。罗盛教烈士坟墓所在地的朝鲜地方政府，写信告诉他：逢年过节，都有朝鲜人民到烈士坟上去祭奠。在坟墓上，每天都有朝鲜少女供献的鲜花。“朝鲜人民对我的儿子太好了”，罗迭开激动地说着，“我这次到朝鲜，就是去郑重地感谢他们对我的恩意，告诉他们：我，还有全中国人民支援他们的决心！”
    刘桂香，是一个年轻的农村妇女，青年团员，村妇女代表，乡妇联主任，区妇联委员，省里的军属模范，是山东省昌乐县贾家庄子人。一九五一年，送自己的丈夫锺学信参加了志愿军。去年，中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团在朝鲜的时候，朝鲜咸镜南道咸兴市的一个送丈夫参军的爱国妇女，送给慰问团一枚银指环，要慰问团带回来，转送给中国同样的一个爱国的姊妹。如今，这枚银指环套在刘桂香的手指上。朝鲜的咸兴市，和中国的昌乐县相隔着千山万水，可是，这枚银指环已把她们的心连接在一起，也把中朝两国千万颗妻子和母亲的心连接在一起了。
    这些英雄们的亲人将要带去祖国人民对英雄儿女和英雄的朝鲜人民的支援和感谢的心意。来自江西瑞金老根据地的红军烈属、志愿军光荣的妈妈刘来娣，临走时，两个乡的老百姓去欢送她，要她转告朝鲜人民：“我们是中国革命老根据地江西瑞金的老百姓，过去遭受着国民党反动派的残酷屠杀，对于你们今天遭到的苦难，体会得特别深切。反动派的刀割在你们身上，也如剜在我们心上一样。我们一定全力支援你们恢复战争创伤，重建和平生活。”志愿军战斗英雄曾南生烈士的母亲罗梦山是湖南长沙市烈、军属委员会的主任委员，在她来的时候，许多烈、军属来看她，要她告诉在朝鲜的子弟：他们一定响应毛主席的号召，努力生产，减少政府的负担，更好地来支援你们。志愿军战士董世贵的未婚妻高桂珍，临走时，村子里的（河北省顺义县河南村）全体青年团员，要她告诉志愿军：“我们一个个身重一百二十斤，干起活来像小牛一般，准备着随时随地响应祖国的号召，挺身而出，做你们的后盾。”
    光荣的烈、军属代表们，还要告诉自己的亲人，政府和人民对他们是如何关怀和尊重，以及他们翻身的好光景。烈士罗盛教家庭缺乏劳动力，生活有些困难，政府优待了他家二千六百七十斤谷子，今年群众给他代耕的地，还能收起三千多斤谷子。天津县人民政府，帮助烈士杨连第家新盖了六间大瓦屋，又贷款给他家买了一头骡子，一架水车。今年他家玉米长得一人多高，全家都做了新衣服。高桂珍的未婚夫董世贵家里的生活也已大大改善，经常可以吃到大米或者白面。志愿军战士锺学信离家时，他家没有牲口，装粮食的囤不到半人高，妻子刘桂香的棉袄还见花，棉裤打着补钉，全乡只有一口猪。如今，他家买了驴子，又买了牛，喂了七口猪，装粮食的囤子比刘桂香还高。一个村里就有一百七、八十口猪！刘桂香穿得里外三层新。村中姑娘们在她临走时的一个晚上，张着灯跟她赶缝新棉袄、新棉裤和新棉被。
    光荣的烈、军属代表们，还带着自己的光荣来会见自己的亲人。来自贵州山区的苗族青年战斗英雄刘兴文烈士的父亲刘玉顺，是生产模范。老红军烈属刘来娣送走了两个儿子参军以后，自己在家里带动群众生产，当选了省劳动模范，政府奖给她了大耕牛、布匹和衣服。志愿军英雄的机枪射手田文富当了战斗英雄后，他的妻子甘玉珍心想：“他当战斗英雄光荣，我也要争取光荣，才能配得过他。”她家的田，全由她和公公婆婆耕种。她常和婆婆走十五里山地上城里去背粪，一次就背一百多斤。一亩地下了五千斤青肥，庄稼穗大粒肥，人人夸她是劳动的好手。一九五一年，她当选了县的劳动模范。一九五二年，又出席了西康省的劳动模范大会。去年五月，她入了青年团，当了乡的青年团支部书记。今年七月，又光荣地入了党。普选的时候，全乡又选她当乡人民代表和县人民代表。光荣的姑娘高桂珍，帮助未婚夫董世贵家种地，三次被选为区、县和省的优抚模范和劳动模范，出席了第二次全国妇女代表大会，见到了毛主席。光荣啊，这些志愿军的好母亲、好妻子和未婚妻们，他们都用自己的模范行动争取了光荣的地位，使她们无愧于是战斗在朝鲜的英雄们的亲人，使志愿军英雄们的光荣的花环上更增添了光辉！
