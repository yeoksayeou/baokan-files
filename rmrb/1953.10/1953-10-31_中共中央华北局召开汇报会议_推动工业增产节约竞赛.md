    Xinhua News Agency, October 30th: To promptly promote the in-depth development of the increased production and economy campaign in industrial and mining enterprises, the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau convened its second reporting meeting from the 26th to the 29th.
    It is evident from the reports of various provinces and cities that since October, the increased production and economy movement has made extremely significant progress in the entire region. This is mainly reflected in: good mass mobilization, well-grasped central keys, and an increased proportion of factories and mines carrying out increased production and economy well. In Tianjin, the proportion of such factories has risen from one-third to more than one-half. Based on the group plans that have been generally established, advanced groups with clear goals, specific measures, and timely inspections can reach 30 to 40 percent. The management of various factories and mines has improved to varying degrees. Breaking through weak links and actively promoting advanced technologies has become a hot trend. With the exception of individual factories and mines, most completed and exceeded the national plan for September and completed the production plan for the first and middle ten days of October.
    However, the meeting pointed out that a blindly optimistic attitude should not be adopted towards the existing achievements, and strenuous efforts must be made to ensure the overfulfillment of the annual national plan.
    The meeting focused on resolving how to further deepen the movement on the existing basis, how to combine enterprise production reforms with increased production and economy, and how to improve the level of enterprise management.
    The meeting pointed out that the key to deepening the increased production and economy movement lies in leadership. Leading according to the different focuses of production reform requirements and by industrial system, and specifically solving problems are the main methods for guiding the movement to deepen. At present, some advanced models have emerged in various types of factories, such as: in the steel industry, Tangshan Steel Plant and the electric furnace steelmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, which have better implemented operation plans and responsibility systems; in the power industry, Tangshan Power Plant and Datong Power Plant, which have done a better job in technical management; in the machinery industry, Tianjin Bicycle Factory, North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, and other units are relatively advanced; in the textile industry, State-owned Cotton Mills No. 3, 5, and 6 are relatively advanced. Local party committees should promote and organize the exchange of these advanced experiences. Another important aspect of guiding the movement to deepen is to strengthen the grassroots group work of factories and mines. The method is to pay attention to both ends—the advanced and the weak—to drive the progress of the middle. Improving group work must be combined with improving workshop leadership.
    The meeting made a detailed study on how to improve the level of enterprise management in the movement. It was believed that leadership should be strengthened by distinguishing three different situations: For factories and mines mainly engaged in operation planning and scheduling, although the combination of increased production and economy and operation planning has been resolved, new imbalances will emerge in the competition; therefore, how to strive for a new balance on the basis of the old balance has become an important topic for leadership. For factories and mines mainly engaged in technical management and new product trial production, the aspects that have been improved in the movement must be consolidated with systems, and mobilizing technicians, veteran skilled workers, and organizing technical workers to learn must be regarded as an important task in leadership. For some factories and mines that are reorganizing their organizations to bring production into order, first, typical examples must be made, and then a plan for overall reform must be formulated, persons in charge must be designated, and a deadline must be set for resolution.
    The meeting also pointed out that local party committees should not only seriously summarize and promote the experiences of their own regions, but also humbly learn from the advanced experiences that have emerged in the work of other places. At present, the work of promoting advanced experience is not yet satisfactory. In order to rapidly improve the production capacity and management level of enterprises, all localities must firmly grasp this link.
    Since this increased production and economy competition is closely integrated with production reform, the meeting pointed out the importance of mobilizing functional departments and believed that leading cadres of factories and mines have not yet learned and have not attached importance to using these departments to better serve production. The important task in the future is how to improve the professional level of cadres in functional departments and enable them to learn the working methods of the mass line.
    The meeting also required all localities to pay attention to the practicality of their work, not to be satisfied with the lively appearance of the movement, and to prepare for next year.

### 中共中央华北局召开汇报会议  推动工业增产节约竞赛

    中共中央华北局召开汇报会议
    推动工业增产节约竞赛
    【新华社三十日讯】为及时推动工矿企业增产节约竞赛的深入展开，中共中央华北局在二十六日至二十九日，召开第二次汇报会议。
    从各省、市的汇报中可以明显地看出，十月份以来增产节约运动在全区已有极为显著的进展。这主要表现在：群众发动好，中心关键抓得好，增产节约开展好的厂矿比例已增多起来，天津市这类工厂的比例已由三分之一上升到二分之一强。从已普遍订立的小组计划来检查，有明确奋斗目标，又有具体措施并能及时进行检查的先进小组，可以达到百分之三十到四十。各厂矿的管理工作都有不同程度的提高。重点突破薄弱环节与积极推广先进技术已成为热潮。除个别厂矿外，大部在九月份完成与超额完成国家计划基础上，完成了十月中、上旬的生产计划。
    但会议指出：对已有的成绩不能采取盲目乐观的态度，还必须经过紧张的努力才能有保证超额完成全年国家计划。
    会议着重解决了如何在现有基础上使运动深入一步，和如何使企业生产改革与增产节约结合起来，把企业管理水平提高一步等方面的问题。
    会议指出：使增产节约运动深入一步的关键在于领导。按生产改革要求的重点不同分类，与按产业分系统进行领导，具体解决问题是指导运动走向深入的主要方法。目前，各类工厂中都涌现了一些先进的典型，如：钢铁业中执行作业计划、责任制较好的有唐山钢厂与太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部；电业中唐山发电厂、大同发电厂技术管理做得较好；机械工业中较先进的有天津自行车厂、华北农业机械总厂、太原矿山机器厂等单位；纺织业中较先进的有国棉三、五、六厂；各地党委要很好地推动和组织这些先进经验的交流。引导运动走向深入的另一个重要方面是加强厂矿的基层小组工作，方法是注意抓两头——先进的与工作薄弱的，以带动中间的前进。改进小组工作必须和改善车间领导结合起来。
    会议对于如何在运动中把企业管理水平提高一步的问题作了详尽的研究。认为应区别三种不同情况加强领导：对于以进行作业计划调度工作为主的厂矿，目前虽然已解决了增产节约与作业计划的结合问题，但竞赛中将出现新的不均衡；因而如何在旧的均衡基础上争取新的均衡，就成为领导的重要课题。对于以技术管理与新产品试制为主的厂矿，必须把在运动中提高了的方面用制度巩固下来，要把发动技术人员、老技术工人与组织技术工人学习当作领导上的重要工作去做。对于以整顿组织使生产纳入正轨的某些厂矿，首先要做出典型，而后制定全盘改革的计划，指定负责人，限期解决。
    会议还指出：各地党委不仅要认真总结与推广自己地区的经验，而且要虚心学习别地工作中涌现出来的先进经验。目前推广先进经验的工作还不能令人满意，为了使企业的生产能力与管理水平能迅速提高，各地必须紧紧地掌握这个环节。
    由于此次增产节约竞赛是和生产改革紧相结合的，会议指出职能部门发动起来的重要意义，并认为，厂矿领导干部还没有学会，也没有重视运用这些部门，使之更好地服务于生产。今后的重要任务是如何提高职能部门干部的业务水平，并使他们学会群众路线的工作方法。
    会议并要求各地注意工作的切实性，不要满足于运动轰轰烈烈的面貌，要为明年做好准备。
