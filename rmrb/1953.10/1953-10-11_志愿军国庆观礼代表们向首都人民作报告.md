Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: The representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army National Day Observation Delegation, starting from the 10th, were invited to report to the people of the capital on their heroic deeds in achieving the great victory of the Korean armistice through heroic fighting, and their firm determination to strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue.

Today there were six reports in total, with about 15,000 listeners. In the open-air theater of Zhongshan Park, more than 4,000 Young Pioneers listened to the reports of Air Force hero Jiang Daoping and two other representatives. The spacious open-air theater was filled with innocent and lively children today, who listened attentively to the heroes' reports. When Jiang Daoping said that an enemy plane foolishly regarded our plane as his own, wagged its tail and approached our plane, and was shot down by Jiang Daoping, the children laughed. The children were also touched by the deeds of Zhang Xianneng, a second-class meritorious worker and member of a cultural troupe, who carried out mobilization work in front of the front line of Old Baldy Mountain. After she finished her report, everyone enthusiastically asked her to sing a song, and after she sang a song of propaganda team members, many children shouted "One more!" She then sang "China-Korea Friendship" in Korean.

In the towering woods of the Labor People's Cultural Palace, more than 3,000 college students listened to the report of Gao Runtian, a second-class hero, on the Battle of White Horse Mountain. In that battle, he led two platoons to penetrate the enemy's defense line, captured three positions in a row, and repelled fifteen counterattacks by an enemy battalion on these positions, opening up a path for our charging troops. His report was interrupted by bursts of applause. At the end of the report, seven female students from Beijing Medical College ran onto the stage and presented flowers to the representatives. The students were all excited and stood up, applauding and cheering. The representatives' reports deeply moved the younger generation of the motherland. Wang Enhai, secretary-general of the Beijing Student Federation, said on behalf of all the students: We must learn from the heroic deeds of the heroes' high internationalism and patriotism, work hard to study and train ourselves, and strive to take up the posts of building the motherland as soon as possible.

The representatives also met with the textile workers of the Qinghe Woolen Mill today. Liu Hanzhao, the leader of the "Heroic Company for Double Victory in Offense and Defense" in the battle of Old Baldy Mountain, reported on their heroic deeds in the battle, which greatly encouraged the textile workers who were carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. Liu Shimei, a national model worker in the textile industry, said: We are determined to learn from the Volunteer Army's spirit of heroic advance and unremitting struggle to complete the task of increasing production and saving 12 billion yuan for the country. Those who listened to the reports of the representatives today also included workers from the 618 Factory, students from the First Branch of the Marx-Lenin Academy, and cadres from the directly subordinate organs of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission.

In the next few days, the representatives will also report to the people of the capital.

    志愿军国庆观礼代表们向首都人民作报告
    【新华社十日讯】    中国人民志愿军国庆节归国观礼代表团的代表们，自十日开始，应邀向首都各界人民报告他们以英勇奋战取得朝鲜停战的伟大胜利的英雄事迹和争取和平解决朝鲜问题的坚强决心。
    今天报告共六场，听众约一万五千余人。在中山公园的露天剧场里，四千多少年先锋队员听取了空军英雄蒋道平等三位代表的报告。宽阔的露天剧场里今天坐满了天真活泼的孩子，他们聚精会神地听英雄们报告。当蒋道平说到一架敌机愚蠢地把我们的飞机当着他自己的飞机，并摆摆尾巴向我机靠拢而被蒋道平击落时，孩子们都大笑起来。孩子们也被二等功臣、文工队员张贤能在老秃山火线前沿进行鼓动工作的事迹所感动。她报告完了后，大家热情地又要她唱一个歌，她唱了一支宣传队员歌后，许多孩子又嚷着“再来一个！”她又用朝鲜语唱了“中朝亲善”歌。
    劳动人民文化宫参天的树林里，三千余个大学生，在听取二级英雄高润田的白马山反击战的经过报告。那次战斗中，他带领两个排插入敌军防线，一连攻下三个阵地，并在这些阵地上打退敌人一个营兵力的十五次反扑；给我军冲锋部队打开了前进道路。他的报告为阵阵的掌声所打断。报告结束时，北京医学院的七个女学生跑上了讲台，将鲜花献给代表们。学生们都激动得站起来，一面鼓掌，一面欢呼。代表们的报告深深感动了祖国的青年一代。北京市学生联合会秘书长王恩海代表全体学生讲话说：我们要学习英雄们高度的国际主义与爱国主义的英雄事迹，努力学习与锻炼自己，争取早日走上建设祖国的岗位。
    代表们今天也和清河制呢厂的纺织工人们见了面。在老秃山战斗中获得“攻守双胜英雄连”连长刘汉钊，报告了他们在战斗中的英雄事迹，给在开展增产节约竞赛的纺织工人们以莫大鼓励。全国纺织工业模范刘世梅说：我们决心学习志愿军英勇前进，奋斗不懈的精神，来完成为国家增产节约一百二十亿元的任务。今天听取代表们的报告的还有：六一八工厂的工人、马克思列宁学院第一分院的学员和中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会直属机关的干部。
    今后数天内代表们还将分别向首都人民作报告。
