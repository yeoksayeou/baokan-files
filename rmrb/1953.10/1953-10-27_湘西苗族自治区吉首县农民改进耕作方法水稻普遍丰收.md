    Farmers in Jishou County, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region, Improve Farming Methods, Achieve Widespread Bumper Harvests of Rice
    Tan Jun, of the Jishou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region, Hunan Province, writes: This year, our county has achieved widespread bumper harvests of rice. Paixiong Township, where the Miao people live in concentrated communities, has seen a miracle of bumper harvests never before seen in history. The average rice yield per mu in the township is 500 jin, double that of last year. Miao farmer Long Baqi harvested 566 jin of grain from his 0.739 mu of land (the worst land).
    Why was our county able to achieve such a bumper harvest this year? After the establishment of the Miao Autonomous Region, the Miao people's sense of being masters of their own affairs and their enthusiasm for production have been further enhanced. The People's Government has also provided economic assistance and technical guidance. This year, the county distributed more than 680 million yuan in various agricultural loans, which solved the difficulties faced by Miao and Han farmers in lacking means of production such as draught cattle, farm implements, and fertilizers. At the same time, through visits and comparisons, key experiments, and forums with veteran farmers, the extensive farming habits of Miao and Han farmers in the past were changed. Most farmers now practice deep plowing and meticulous harrowing, winter plowing and waterlogging, pest control, and fertilizer application on slopes; some even practice sparse planting with dense seedlings, and intertillage and topdressing. Because our county has high mountains and little water, droughts often occur in the past. The People's Government led the Miao and Han farmers to vigorously find water sources and build ponds and dams. Last winter and this spring, 287 water conservancy projects were built, increasing the irrigated area of paddy fields by more than 5,000 mu. In addition, attention was paid to mobilizing the masses to compact field ridges, raise the height of water inlets, dig mountain ditches, and open capillary canals for field water conservation. Therefore, there was basically no drought in the county this year, enabling both flat and sloping fields to achieve bumper harvests.

### 湘西苗族自治区吉首县农民改进耕作方法水稻普遍丰收

    湘西苗族自治区吉首县农民改进耕作方法水稻普遍丰收
    中共湖南省湘西苗族自治区吉首县委员会谭军来信：今年我县水稻普遍获得丰收，苗族聚居的排兄乡出现了历史上从来未曾有过的丰收奇迹。全乡每亩水稻平均产量五百斤，比去年增产一倍。苗族农民龙把其的七分三厘九等田（最差的田）竟打谷五百六十六斤。
    今年我县为什么能够获得这样的丰收呢？苗族自治区成立后，苗族人民当家作主的观念和生产积极性有了进一步的提高。人民政府又给予经济扶助和技术指导。今年全县发放了六亿八千多万元的各种农业贷款，使苗汉两族农民解决了耕牛、农具、肥料等生产资料不足的困难。同时通过参观评比、重点试验和老农座谈会，改变了苗汉两族农民过去粗放的耕作习惯。大部农民做到深犁细耙，冬耕浸水，治虫，肥料上坡；有的还做到少秧密植，中耕追肥。由于我县山高水少，过去经常发生旱灾，人民政府领导苗、汉两族农民大力找水源，修塘坝。去冬今春兴修了水利工程二百八十七处，增灌稻田面积五千多亩。另外还注意发动群众进行捶紧田坎、加高月口、挖山沟、开毛圳等田间保水工作。因此，全县今年基本上没有发生旱灾，使平田和坡田都获得了丰收。
