Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 27th: This reporter, Jiang Nan, reports: At the second meeting on the political conference issue between both sides on the 27th, representatives of the Korean and Chinese governments pointed out: The important and urgent task before the representatives of the two sides is to quickly agree on the relevant neutral countries participating in the political conference. Any evasion of the issue of political conference members will only further delay the progress of convening the political conference. However, the U.S. government representative today repeated the U.S. refusal to allow neutral countries to participate in the political conference and attacked the neutral countries in Asia.

　　In a lengthy speech, U.S. government representative Dean opposed the participation of neutral countries, and listed countries such as Pakistan, India, Burma, Ceylon, and Indonesia, expressing serious doubts about the impartiality and sense of responsibility of these neutral Asian countries. Dean maliciously said: "If we invite neutral countries to participate," then, "the political conference would be turned into an endless debate."

　　Dean flatly denied the contributions made by many neutral countries, especially neutral Asian countries such as India, to the realization of the Korean armistice. Dean said: Neutral countries should not participate in the political conference because they do not "pay the price" for the outcome of the political conference, and only those belligerent countries that "pay the price for the consequences of their own actions" can participate.

　　It is particularly noteworthy that Dean dictatorially said: If the Korean and Chinese representatives do not withdraw the fundamental issue of the membership of the political conference, "it will obviously hinder any agreement," and the current talks will be "fruitless." Dean's intimidation on the second day of the meeting is of a very serious nature. It is obviously completely useless and ridiculous for the U.S. side to try to intimidate the Korean and Chinese sides into abandoning the reasonable proposition of inviting neutral countries to participate in the political conference. This arbitrary attitude of the U.S. side only shows that the U.S. side came to participate in the bilateral talks, and beneath its pretense, it is extremely insincere and harbors ulterior motives to obstruct the success of the talks.

　　In his speech, Dean repeated the U.S.'s old tune of distorting General Nam Il's speech in the armistice negotiations and misinterpreting Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement, claiming that neutral countries should not participate in the political conference, and insisted that the Korean and Chinese governments only mentioned the issue of membership after mentioning the time and place of the political conference in their notification to the U.S. government. However, as is well known, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai solemnly refuted the U.S. government's distortion of the facts in his notification to the U.S. government on October 19, and clearly pointed out: "The Korean and Chinese negotiating delegations have never claimed throughout the entire armistice negotiation process that the political conference should not have other relevant neutral countries participating. From Article 60 of the Korean Armistice Agreement, it is also impossible to draw the conclusion that the political conference must exclude the participation of other relevant neutral countries." Foreign Minister Zhou stated that "it is more important to resolve the issue of the membership of the political conference in the talks," and stated that "the right to raise, discuss, and resolve the issue of the membership of the political conference in this talk is reserved."

　　In his lengthy propaganda speech, Dean put forward four "goals" after the political conference is convened. However, in these "goals," he only used empty words such as "bandaging the wounds of war-torn Korea," and did not mention the issue of "withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea" explicitly stipulated in Article 60 of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Everyone knows that this is a prerequisite for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. At the end of his lengthy speech, Dean even shamelessly said: "Let us convene this conference in accordance with the Armistice Agreement." From the above point, it can be seen that the U.S. has adopted a completely frivolous attitude towards the solemn Armistice Agreement.

　　Representatives of the Korean and Chinese governments emphasized at today's meeting that the U.S. side has no reason to prevent relevant neutral countries, especially relevant neutral countries in Asia, from participating in the political conference to jointly seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    美方代表迪安一口抹煞亚洲中立国家对朝鲜停战的贡献
    证明美方在双方会谈中包藏祸心缺乏诚意
    【新华社开城二十七日电】本社特派记者江南报道：在二十七日关于政治会议问题的双方会谈第二次会议上，朝中两国政府代表指出：双方会谈代表面前的重大而迫切的工作，就是迅速商定参加政治会议的有关中立国家。对于政治会议成员问题的任何回避不谈，将只是进一步拖延有关政治会议召开的工作的进行。然而，美国政府代表今天重复美国拒绝中立国家参加政治会议的立场，并攻击亚洲的中立国家。
    美国政府代表迪安在一篇冗长的发言中，反对中立国家参加，并列举了巴基斯坦、印度、缅甸、锡兰和印度尼西亚等国，对这些亚洲中立国家的公正和责任感表示严重的怀疑。迪安恶意地说：“假如我们邀请中立国家参加”，那么，“政治会议会被变成一个无休止的辩论会”。
    迪安一口抹煞许多中立国家，特别是印度等亚洲中立国家对实现朝鲜停战所作的贡献。迪安说：中立国家不应参加政治会议，因为他们对政治会议的结果并不“付出代价”，只有那些对“它们自己的行动的后果付出代价”的交战国家才能参加。
    尤其值得注意的是，迪安专断地说：假如朝中代表不撤回政治会议的成员问题这一根本问题，“很明白的将会阻挠任何协议”，而且现在的会谈将是“没有结果的”。在会谈的第二天迪安就发出这种恫吓言词，性质是十分严重的。美方要想用这种手段来吓诈朝中方面放弃邀请中立国参加政治会议这一合理主张，显然是完全没有用处而且是十分可笑的。美方的这种专横态度只说明，美方来参加双方会谈，在它装模作样的外表里面，是极端缺乏诚意并包藏着阻挠会谈成功的祸心的。
    迪安在发言中又重复美国歪曲南日将军在停战谈判中的发言和曲解停战协定第六十款的滥调，声称中立国家不应参加政治会议，并硬说朝中两国政府在给美国政府的通知中主张只是在提到政治会议的时间和地点问题之后，才提到成员问题。但是，如所周知，周恩来外长在十月十九日给美国政府的通知中已严正地驳斥了美国政府的歪曲事实，并明确地指出：“朝中谈判代表团在整个停战谈判的过程中，从来就没有主张过政治会议不应该有其他有关中立国家参加。从朝鲜停战协定第六十款中，也根本不可能得出政治会议必须排斥其他有关中立国家参加的结论。”周外长声明在双方“会谈中更主要的还是应当解决政治会议的成员问题”，并声明“保留在这一会谈中提出讨论和解决政治会议成员问题的权利”。
    迪安在长篇的宣传发言中，提出了在政治会议召开后的四项“目的”，然而在这几项“目的”中，只是使用了“包扎被战争蹂躏的朝鲜的创伤”之类的空洞词语，偏偏没有提起朝鲜停战协定第六十款明文规定的“从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队”的问题，谁都知道，这正是和平解决朝鲜问题的先决条件。迪安在他冗长的发言的最后，竟然还厚颜地说：“让我们依照停战协定来召开这个会议”，从上面这一点就可以看出美国对于庄严的停战协定所采取的完全是儿戏的态度。
    朝中两国政府代表在今天的会议上强调指出：美方没有任何理由来阻止有关中立国家，特别是亚洲的有关中立国家参加政治会议，以协力寻求朝鲜问题的和平解决。
