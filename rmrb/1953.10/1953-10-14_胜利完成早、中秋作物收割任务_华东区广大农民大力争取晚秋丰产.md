    Successfully Complete Early and Mid-Autumn Crop Harvesting Tasks;
    Broad Masses of Farmers in East China Vigorously Strive for Bumper Late Autumn Harvest
    This year, the broad masses of farmers in East China, on the basis of constantly fighting against natural disasters and achieving victories, have universally completed the harvesting tasks of early and mid-autumn crops, and are now vigorously striving for a bumper harvest of late autumn crops.
    This year, various natural disasters have successively attacked various parts of East China. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the broad masses of farmers in the region have actively overcome various difficulties and persisted in the struggle. In fields suffering from frost and hail, they used methods such as watering and fertilizing to promote the recovery of seedlings, and replanted new seeds in fields with missing seedlings; in flooded fields, they vigorously drained water to save seedlings; in drought-stricken fields, they rotated day and night to pump and irrigate water; for fields that could not be rescued, they promptly replanted early-maturing crops such as buckwheat or supplementary foods such as radishes and vegetables. Because the broad masses of farmers have continuously achieved victories in the above struggles, they have created conditions for increasing the production of various crops. This year, the region's 20 million mu of early-maturing rice still yielded a harvest of about 10% higher than last year. Of the more than 50 million mu of mid-maturing rice, except for some areas severely affected by drought and typhoons, which suffered varying degrees of crop failure, areas not affected by disasters or that overcame disasters can still produce more than last year. Generally, the more than 90 million mu of miscellaneous grains such as corn, sorghum, and millet also yielded about 10% more than last year. For example, in Su County and Fuyang Prefectures, Anhui Province, which were more severely affected by frost, farmers overcame the disasters, and miscellaneous grains such as corn and sorghum generally also achieved increased production. At present, the more than 30 million mu of late rice, more than 30 million mu of sweet potatoes, and miscellaneous grains and supplementary food crops such as buckwheat still in the fields, together with the 20 million mu of cotton that has begun to blossom, are generally growing well. If they do not encounter irresistible disasters before harvesting, it is also hoped that they will produce more than last year. For example, in the 14 counties of Pinghu and Jiashan in Jiaxing Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, the 840,000 mu of "water-cut fields" and "dry white fields" rescued during the drought can also achieve increased production.

    胜利完成早、中秋作物收割任务
    华东区广大农民大力争取晚秋丰产
    华东区广大农民，今年在不断与自然灾害作斗争并取得胜利的基础上，普遍完成早、中秋作物收割任务，现正大力争取晚秋作物丰收。
    今年华东各地先后曾受到各种自然灾害的袭击，全区广大农民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，积极克服各种困难，坚持斗争。他们在遭受霜灾雹灾的田里，以浇水、施肥等办法，促进幼苗恢复生机，在缺苗的田里补上新种；在受涝的田里，大力排涝救苗；在受旱的田里日夜轮流车水、浇水；对于部分抢救无效的田，都及时的补种上荞麦等早熟作物或萝卜蔬菜等副食品。由于广大农民在以上斗争中不断取得胜利，为各种作物增产创造了条件。今年全区二千万亩早熟稻仍然获得比去年增产一成上下的收成，五千余万亩中熟稻，除部分受旱灾、台灾严重地区遭到不同程度歉收外，未受灾害或克服灾害的地区，仍可比去年增产，其它如玉米、高粱、谷子等九千余万亩杂粮，一般都比去年增产百分之十上下。如受霜灾较严重的安徽省宿县、阜阳等专区，农民战胜了灾害，玉米、高粱等杂粮，也普遍获得增产。目前，还在田里的三千多万亩晚稻，三千多万亩甘薯及荞麦等杂粮和副食品作物，连同已开始收花的二千万亩棉花，生长情况一般尚好，在收割前如不再遇到不可抗拒的灾害，亦可望比去年增产，如浙江省嘉兴专区平湖、嘉善等十四个县，在抗旱中抢救出来的八十四万亩“断水田”、“干白田”，也都可获得增产。    （本报记者朱学科）
