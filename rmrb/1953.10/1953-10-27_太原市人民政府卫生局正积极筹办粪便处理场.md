    Taiyuan Municipal People's Government Health Bureau Actively Preparing to Establish Fecal Treatment Plant

    Letter from the Taiyuan Municipal People's Government Health Bureau: The "Digest of Readers' Letters" column on September 20th published a reader's letter reflecting that no one in Taiyuan City was emptying the latrines, which is basically correct. In the past, the treatment of feces in our city was organized by suburban farmers who were responsible for transporting it; however, every time during the busy farming season, the farmers were unable to enter the city to transport the feces, and the feces in the city could not be cleared in time. This phenomenon has become more serious as the urban area has expanded and the population has increased. The same situation of incomplete fecal removal occurred during the busy farming season this year. At that time, our bureau transferred three trucks to transport it. After the summer harvest, the number of manure trucks entering the city gradually increased, and the phenomenon of overflowing manure was basically eliminated. Now our bureau is actively preparing to establish a fecal treatment plant, and has begun pilot projects of emptying and transporting in the city, so the phenomenon of no one emptying the latrines in the future should be avoided.

### 太原市人民政府卫生局正积极筹办粪便处理场

    太原市人民政府卫生局正积极筹办粪便处理场
    太原市人民政府卫生局来信：九月二十日“读者来信摘要”栏刊登了读者反映太原市粪便没人掏的来信，基本上是正确的。本市粪便的处理，过去是组织郊区农民掏运；但是每到农忙时期，农民不能入城运粪，市内粪便就不能及时清除。这种现象在市区扩大、人口增加后，更加严重。今年农忙时期，也同样发生粪便清除不完的情况，当时我局曾抽调三辆汽车进行运送。夏收过后，入市粪车逐渐增加，粪满现象基本上消除。现在我局正积极筹办粪便处理场，并已在市内开始典型试办掏运，今后粪便无人掏的现象当可避免。
