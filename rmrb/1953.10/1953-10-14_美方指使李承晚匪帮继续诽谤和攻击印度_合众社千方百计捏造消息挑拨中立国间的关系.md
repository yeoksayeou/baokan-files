Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 13th: The US side is using the Li Cheng-wan gang to continue slandering and attacking India, which is serving as the chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. US Ambassador to South Korea, Briggs, met with Li Cheng-wan on the 12th. After Briggs left Li Cheng-wan's so-called "presidential palace," Li Cheng-wan instructed his Public Information Office Director, Ge Hongji, to issue a statement viciously attacking Indian Prime Minister Nehru and slandering India as not being a neutral nation. The statement continued to attack the Indian troops guarding prisoners of war in the demilitarized zone.

Prior to this, the Li Cheng-wan gang had fabricated a letter from prisoners of war to Li Cheng-wan, which was said to have been brought out by nine special agents who had escaped from the POW camp. In this letter, the Li Cheng-wan gang repeated the attacks that the US military authorities had made against the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, falsely claiming that the NNRC had used threats to intimidate prisoners of war and force them to repatriate. The letter also requested Li Cheng-wan to help them "escape collectively." This shows that Li Cheng-wan has not abandoned his plot to create a "collective escape" of prisoners of war.

Sources here point out that while the US is hypocritically saying that it wants Li Cheng-wan to exercise "restraint and tolerance," it is instigating him to frantically make shrew-like clamors, its purpose clearly being to continue obstructing and interfering with the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, making it impossible for it to perform its duties, while continuing to create public opinion against India's participation in the Korean political conference.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 13th: The United Press International, mouthpiece of the US State Department, is trying every possible means to sow discord among neutral nations. UPI's reporter in Panmunjom, Jordan, reported on the 5th that "Swedish and Swiss personnel" revealed that "if it were not for the Indians," the "detailed rules for explanation and visitation" would "have become a tool for 'complete betrayal' to the Communists." However, in an internal memo to Dillon of UPI on the 11th, he admitted that this statement was "made by a UN officer, not a Swede or a Swiss." Although it was clearly fabricated news, he still said, "I don't think we should withdraw this news," and he revealed that he would continue to fabricate such news. He shamelessly boasted that "we are the only news agency writing this kind of news, and this kind of news obviously needs to be written." The purpose of UPI's fabrication of rumors is very clear: to carry out sabotage from within the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, so that the US plot to sabotage the explanation work can be realized.

### 美方指使李承晚匪帮继续诽谤和攻击印度  合众社千方百计捏造消息挑拨中立国间的关系

    美方指使李承晚匪帮继续诽谤和攻击印度
    合众社千方百计捏造消息挑拨中立国间的关系
    【新华社开城十三日电】美方利用李承晚匪帮继续对担任中立国遣返委员会主席的印度大肆诽谤和攻击。美国驻南朝鲜大使布里格斯在十二日会见了李承晚。在布里格斯离开李承晚的所谓“总统府”以后，李承晚就授意他的公报处处长葛弘基发表了一篇声明，对印度总理尼赫鲁进行恶毒的攻击，诽谤印度不是中立国。声明继续对在非军事区看管战俘的印度部队大加抨击。
    在此以前，李承晚匪帮曾经捏造了一封战俘写给李承晚的信，这封信据说是由九名从战俘营中逃出的特务分子带出去的。在这封信中，李承晚匪帮重复美国军事当局对中立国遣返委员会曾经进行过的攻击，硬说中立国遣返委员会用威胁手段恫吓战俘，强迫他们遣返。这封信还要求李承晚帮助他们“集体逃跑”。从这一点可以看出，李承晚并没有放弃制造战俘“集体逃跑”的阴谋。
    此间人士指出，美方一方面假惺惺地说要李承晚“节制与容忍”，一方面却指使他出来疯狂地作泼妇骂街式的叫嚣，其目的显然在于继续对中立国遣返委员会的工作进行阻挠和干涉，使其无法执行职务，同时继续制造舆论反对印度参加朝鲜政治会议。
    【新华社开城十三日电】美国国务院的喉舌合众社正在千方百计地在中立国之间进行挑拨。合众社在板门店的记者约旦曾经在五日报道说：“瑞典和瑞士的人士”透露，“要不是由于印度人的关系”，“解释和访问工作细则”会“已成为向共产党‘完全出卖’的工具了”。但是他在十一日给合众社狄龙的内部通报中却承认，这话是“一个联合国军官说的，而不是瑞典人或瑞士人说的”。虽然明明是捏造的消息，但是他仍然说，“我认为我们不应撤回这项消息”，他透露他还要继续制造这种消息。他无耻地吹嘘说，“我们是写这种消息的唯一的一个通讯社，这种消息显然是需要写的。”合众社这种造谣说谎的目的是很清楚的，这就是要从中立国遣返委员会内部来进行破坏，使美方破坏解释工作的阴谋得以实现。
