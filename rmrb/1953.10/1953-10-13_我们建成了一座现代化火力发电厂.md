    We Have Built a Modern Thermal Power Plant
    Yuan Bin, Deputy Director of the Northwest Electric Power Administration, Director of the Xi'an Second Power Plant Preparation Office

    In the first year of our country's planned national economic construction, the Northwest region successfully built a modern, large-scale thermal power plant. This is of great significance both nationally and for the Northwest. The completion of this power plant promptly meets the urgent electricity needs of Xi'an and Xianyang for industrial power and urban lighting, and it propels the industrial construction of the Northwest forward. At the same time, with the completion of this power plant, our construction experience has been enriched, and construction talent in the Northwest region has been cultivated, giving us the confidence to rely on the superior conditions of the whole country to build modern industry in economically underdeveloped areas at a rate exceeding ordinary development.
    The preparation for this power plant, including collecting data, surveying the site, designing, and ordering equipment, began in 1950. Construction started on November 4, 1952, and has taken eleven months so far. No. 1 turbine and No. 1 boiler have already started operating, and the entire project will be completed by the end of the year. Power plants are the most complex projects, with thousands of engineering drawings and over 5,000 tons of equipment and metal materials to be installed. These devices are crisscrossed, layered, and connected, arranged in an orderly fashion in the heart of a small plant. The characteristic of a modern power plant is the replacement of many laborious manual operations with machines. The equipment is very complex, and at the same time, the power plant itself has a strong vibration, so the operational requirements during the construction process are particularly strict. If a wire is connected incorrectly, the machine will suffer unimaginable damage. We had absolutely no experience in building such a difficult and complex project, and the Northwest is an area with a weak industrial base. Construction technical forces and materials all needed assistance from other regions or even foreign countries, which made the work even more arduous. However, we completed the task in eleven months and fulfilled the requirements of the state plan. The quality of the construction and installation work fully meets the design requirements, and the quality of the main projects has also reached a good standard. We deeply experienced that: guaranteeing the quality of the project is the greatest saving and also the basis for speeding up the project. There were no rework wastes in the main projects, and there were no major rework wastes in the secondary projects. The state's funds were used rationally in the entire project. At the same time, there were no deaths during the construction process, and serious injuries were also rare. This is a major achievement of the past eleven months.
    Why were we able to achieve such results?
    First of all, it is due to the Party and the government's attention, leadership, and strong support. This project is one of the key projects in the Northwest's capital construction this year. The Party and the People's Government resolutely implemented the policy of "concentrating forces to firmly handle urgent needs that can be handled with conditions." From ideological leadership to solving practical difficulties, they organized a large force to support us from beginning to end. During the construction process, Comrade Ma Mingfang, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and other responsible comrades in the Northwest region came to the construction site several times to inspect the work, giving us specific instructions, encouraging all employees, and promoting relevant agencies to pay attention to and support us. The Ministry of Fuel Industry and the General Administration of Electric Power actively sought solutions to the difficulties of materials and manpower that could not be solved in the Northwest region. For example, when building the chimney, after receiving the drawings, it was found that the structure had been changed (originally reinforced concrete, changed to reinforced brick structure), and the originally prepared materials were not suitable. However, the project urgently needed to start. The Ministry of Fuel Industry and the General Administration of Electric Power allocated a batch of bricks stored in a certain brick factory in Kailuan for our use. These played a very important guarantee role in our work, preventing major errors in the project, especially avoiding serious downtime waiting for materials.
    Secondly, all employees treated the country's construction cause with a sense of ownership, and demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in the construction. This project was carried out through a severe winter and a hot summer. In the winter with sub-zero temperatures and wind and snow, the workers never interrupted their work. Some southern workers had their hands and ears frostbitten, but they still insisted on working. The summer here is not only hot but also rainy, but whenever the workers thought of the urgent need for electricity in Northwest industry, they immediately fought against the rain with unparalleled courage and wisdom. Just as the steel frame was being installed for the outdoor substation project, it rained continuously for three days. The workers set up a canvas shed at the construction site to weld the steel frame and carried out the installation work in the rain. The employees also deeply understand that capital construction is a long-term plan, and only by strictly accepting the guidance of Soviet experts, implementing operating procedures, and actively adopting advanced Soviet experience can we ensure the quality of the project. In construction engineering, advanced Soviet construction methods were adopted from beginning to end. Soviet experts pointed out that this is a secondary macroporous loess layer. The soil is inherently hard, but it softens when it meets water, and the building will inevitably sink, crack, and even collapse in the future. Therefore, paying attention to waterproofing during the construction process is the key issue related to the future of the project. After the employees understood this scientific truth, the waterproofing work was done very well. The mixer was placed 50 meters away from the building, and snow was swept after snowfall in winter. During the installation process, the materials without quality specification certificates were tested, special workers underwent technical examinations, and quality tests were carried out after the completion of the concealed works. Here, it must be emphasized that the Northeast 103 Engineering Team supported this project. During the operation process, they put the drawings at hand and checked them at any time. Even if there was a hair's breadth of error in a small place, they would correct it seriously. All of these fully demonstrate that our country has entered a period of planned economic construction, and the workers are infinitely loyal, diligent, and brave in treating the country's construction cause.
    Third, the sincere and selfless assistance of the Soviet government and the Soviet people. This project was designed by Soviet experts and equipped with the latest Soviet-produced machinery and equipment. From collecting data and surveying the site to on-site construction, it was all specifically guided by Soviet experts. Soviet experts treated our country's construction cause with the same loyalty, enthusiasm, and serious responsibility as they treated their own country's construction in the Soviet Union. From the preparation of the construction plan to the worker's operation, specific guidance was given. The operational guidance for the workers not only tells you how to do it, but also tells you why you do it. For some difficult tasks, the experts were afraid that we would not do it well, so they checked it several times and even did it themselves. This enthusiastic and responsible work spirit of Soviet experts is visible everywhere. They immersed themselves in the scene day and night. No matter which project it was, Soviet experts contributed their strength. Especially when the work was tense, they worked until midnight and still went to work on time the next day. This work spirit of the experts deeply moved all our employees, and we took Soviet experts as our learning model. Soviet experts not only helped us technically, but also often helped us improve construction management. When we encountered difficult problems in our work, we asked for advice, and the experts always patiently helped solve them. This great selfless internationalist spirit is also reflected in the Soviet experts' frequent and sincere criticism of our shortcomings in our work. We deeply feel that without the assistance of the Soviet government and the Soviet people, without the help and guidance of Soviet experts, it would not have been possible to achieve such results in such a complex and advanced industrial construction.
    Fourth, this project would have been difficult to complete without the support of fraternal agencies, factories, and schools. During the construction process, we successively received assistance from more than 30 units outside the region and in the Northwest. This assistance was multifaceted, with some providing manpower assistance and some providing material assistance. During the progress of the project, there was a time when there was a severe shortage of cold work workers. Baoji Railway Machinery Factory twice transferred more than 50 workers to help us manufacture the main plant roof frame and cooling tower steel structure. Northwest Machinery Factory helped us process and manufacture many parts. Northwest Institute of Science and Technology and Northwest Institute of Technology helped us test many metal materials. In the case of urgent need for materials in the project, Northwest Petroleum Administration Bureau, Northwest Textile Administration Bureau and other agencies lent us steel, wood, and cement, some of which were to be used by them. Xi'an Railway Transportation Branch and a certain station gave great help in calling for train cars, unloading goods, and solving the transportation for thousands of employees going out. The Northwest Office of the Central First Ministry of Machine Industry sent a surveying team to help us complete the measurement work of the external sewer of the factory. The local township people's government and the peasant masses were particularly concerned about this project and gave great help in the purchase of land for the factory, employee accommodation, and the employment of temporary workers in the factory.
    Of course, this project is not perfect and without flaws. Many shortcomings and errors also occurred during the construction process, some of which were serious. For example, the quality of some projects was not good enough, resulting in hundreds of millions of yuan in waste; many materials were also not supplied in time, and there were phenomena of downtime waiting for materials in the project; in particular, the political work on the construction site was very poor, so that the relationship between departments and cadres often became uncoordinated, and some phenomena of violating mass discipline and lax labor discipline occurred, which had a certain impact on the progress of the project. These shortcomings are mainly due to our lack of experience. After this test, all employees and managers have improved their technology, enriched their work experience, and made us more confident and able to undertake more, larger, and more complex industrial construction tasks.

    我们建成了一座现代化火力发电厂
    西北电业管理局副局长  西安第二发电厂筹建处主任  原斌
    在我国开始有计划的国民经济建设的第一年，西北地区胜利地建成了一座现代化的规模较大的火力发电厂。这在全国和西北来说，都有很重大的意义。这座电厂的建成，及时满足了西安、咸阳工业动力和城市照明迫切需要的电力，它带动西北的工业建设前进一步。同时，随着这座电厂的建成，丰富了我们的建设经验，培养了西北地区的建设人材，使我们有信心依靠全国的优越条件，在经济发展比较落后的地区，以超过寻常发展比例的速度，建设现代化的工业。
    这座发电厂是从一九五零年起，着手搜集资料，勘察厂址，进行设计和订购设备的。一九五二年十一月四日动工兴建，到现在共进行了十一个月，一号汽轮机，一号锅炉已开始运转，年底将全部完成。电厂是最复杂的工程，工程图纸就有数千张，装置的设备和金属材料五千多吨。这些设备纵横交错、层层相连，很有秩序地安排在一座面积不大的厂房心脏地区。现代化发电厂的特点是用机器代替了许多费力的人工操作，设备非常复杂，同时发电厂本身有很强的震动性，所以建设过程中的操作要求特别严格，假如接错一根电线，就会使机器遭到不可设想的损失。建设这样艰巨复杂的工程，我们是完全没有经验的，而西北又是一个工业基础薄弱的地区，施工技术力量和物资都需要外区甚至国外援助，这就更增加了工作的艰巨性。但是，我们用了十一个月的时间完成了任务，实现了国家计划的要求。建筑与安装工程质量完全合乎设计要求，主要工程的质量还达到了良好的标准。我们深深体验到：保证工程质量就是最大的节约，也是加快工程速度的基础。这里主要工程没有返工浪费，次要工程也没有重大的返工浪费，全部工程合理地使用了国家的资金。同时，施工过程中，没有发生死亡事故，重伤事故也很少。这就是十一个月来的重大成就。
    我们为什么能够获得这样的成绩呢？
    首先是由于党和政府重视领导和大力支持。这个工程是西北今年基本建设工程中的重点工程之一，党和人民政府坚决贯彻了“急需办的有条件办的必须集中力量坚决办好”的方针，自始至终从思想领导直到解决实际困难，组织很大力量支持我们。施工过程中，中共中央西北局书记马明方同志和西北区的其他负责同志，曾几次来工地检查工作，给我们具体指示，鼓舞了全体职工，并推动了有关机关重视支持我们。在西北地区无法解决的材料、人力等困难，中央人民政府燃料工业部和电业管理总局都积极设法解决。如建造烟囱时，当接到图纸后发现变更了结构（原来是钢筋混凝土，改为钢筋砖结构），原来准备好的材料不适用，但工程已迫切需要开工，燃料工业部和电业管理总局，便把开滦某砖厂所存的一批砖拨给我们使用。这些对我们的工作起了很重要的保证作用，使工程没有发生重大的错误，特别是避免了严重的停工待料现象。
    其次，全体职工以主人翁的态度对待国家的建设事业，在施工中发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。这个工程的进行，是经过了一个严寒的冬天和一个炎热的夏季。在零下四度风雪交加的冬天，工人们没有间断过工作。有的南方工人冻破了手和耳朵，仍然坚持工作。这里的夏季不仅热而且多雨，但是工人们每想到西北工业迫切需要电力时，立即以无比的勇敢和智慧，与雨作斗争。正当户外变电站工程安装铁架时，连下了三天雨，工人们在工地搭起帆布棚焊接铁架，冒雨进行安装工作。职工们也深深地懂得，基本建设是百年大计，只有严格接受苏联专家的指导和执行操作规程，积极地采用苏联先进经验，才能保证工程质量。在建筑工程上，从头到尾采用了苏联先进的施工方法。苏联专家指出：这里是二级大孔性黄土层，土壤本质很坚硬，但一见水便松软起来，以后建筑物难免下沉裂缝甚至倒塌。因此，在建筑过程中注意防水问题是关乎工程前途的关键问题。职工们懂得了这个科学道理后，防水工作做得很好。搅拌机安置在建筑物五十公尺以外，冬季落雪后进行扫雪。安装过程中，对没有质量规格证件的材料作了化验，特种工人进行了技术考试，隐蔽工程完成后作了质量试验。这里，必须着重提出的，是支援这个工程的东北一○三工程队。在操作过程中，他们把图纸放在手边随时核对，即使细小的地方有一根头发丝的差错，也要认真纠正。所有这些，充分显示出我国进入有计划的经济建设时期，工人们对待国家建设事业的无比忠诚、勤奋和勇敢。
    第三、苏联政府和苏联人民的真诚无私的援助。这个工程是苏联专家设计的，装置着苏联最新出产的机器设备。从搜集资料、勘察厂址到现场施工，都是由苏联专家具体指导的。苏联专家对待我国建设事业的忠诚、热情和严肃负责，如同他们在苏联对待自己的国家建设一样。从编制施工计划直到工人操作，都给予具体指导。对待工人的操作指导，不仅告诉你怎样做，还要告诉你为什么这样做。有些难做的工作，专家们惟恐我们做不好，就几次地进行检查，甚至亲自作。苏联专家这种热情负责的工作精神，是到处可见的。他们日日夜夜地置身在现场，不论那一项工程，苏联专家都献出了力量，特别是当工作紧张的时候，工作到半夜，第二天仍然按时上班。专家们这种工作精神，深深地感动了我们全体职工，我们以苏联专家作为自己学习的榜样。苏联专家不仅是在技术上帮助我们，而且也经常地帮助我们改善施工管理。我们的工作遇到困难问题时去请教，专家总是耐心地帮助解决。这种伟大的无私的国际主义精神，也还表现在苏联专家们经常对我们工作中的缺点给予诚恳的批评。我们深刻地感到，这样复杂的高级的工业建设，如果没有苏联政府和人民的援助，没有苏联专家的帮助和指导，是不能做出这样的成绩的。
    第四、这一工程如果没有兄弟机关、工厂和学校的支援，也是很难完成的。在建设过程中，我们先后取得了外区和西北三十多个单位的援助。这种援助是多方面的，有的是给予人力援助，有的是给予物资援助。在工程进展中，曾有一度十分缺少冷作工人，宝鸡铁路机厂两次抽调了五十多名工人，帮助我们制作了主厂房屋架和冷却塔钢结构。西北机器厂帮助我们加工与制造出许多机件。西北科学试验所和西北工学院，帮助我们化验了许多金属材料。在工程迫切需要材料的情况下，西北石油管理局、西北纺织管理局等机关借给钢材、木材、水泥，其中有些材料是他们将要使用的。西安铁路运输分局和某车站，在调用车皮、卸货和解决数千名职工出外的交通工具上，都给予了很大的帮助。中央第一机械工业部西北办事处派测量队，帮助我们完成了厂外下水道的测量工作。当地区乡人民政府和农民群众，特别关心这个工程，在工厂买地、职工住宿和厂内雇用临时工人等方面，也给予极大的帮助。
    当然，这个工程也并不是十全十美毫无缺陷的，施工过程中同样发生了许多缺点和错误，有些还是严重的。如有些工程质量还并不够好，以致造成了数亿元的浪费；也有许多材料由于供应不及，工程中发生了停工待料的现象；特别是工地的政治工作很差，以致部门之间、干部之间的关系，经常发生不协调的现象，发生一些违犯群众纪律和劳动纪律松懈的现象，这些对工程的进展均有一定的影响。这些缺点，主要是由于我们经验不足所产生的。经过这次考验，全体职工和管理人员，提高了技术，丰富了工作经验，使我们更有信心、有把握地担负更多更大更复杂的工业建设任务。
