    State-Owned Trading Departments in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region
    Actively Carry Out the Work of Purchasing Animal Products

    The state-owned livestock product companies and cooperatives in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region are actively carrying out the work of purchasing animal products. From January to August this year, the livestock product companies in Labrang and Jiucheng have purchased more than 944,000 jin of wool and more than 47,000 pieces of cattle hides and various wild animal skins. All livestock product companies have made great improvements in their purchasing work. The Labrang Livestock Product Company simplified the purchasing procedures and jointly established an office with trading companies, banks, and other units, so that herdsmen can sell their animal products and buy daily necessities in a timely manner and return home on the same day. In order to take care of herdsmen from distant places, the Jiucheng Livestock Product Company purchases goods as soon as they arrive, introduces local prices to them, helps them purchase goods from trading companies, and also uses symposiums and other forms to regularly conduct publicity among herdsmen and solicit opinions on purchasing work.
    In addition to producing fur, the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region is also rich in musk, deer antler, rhubarb, codonopsis, and dozens of other medicinal materials. Now is the season for digging and collecting medicinal materials, and local trading units are preparing to purchase them in large quantities. They have also conducted investigations on the yield, producing areas, and quality of medicinal materials, and have formulated purchasing plans. At the same time, they have also sent cadres to pastoral areas to publicize purchasing prices and specifications, and to organize herdsmen to dig and collect them in large quantities.

    甘南藏族自治区国营贸易部门
    积极开展收购畜产品的工作
    甘南藏族自治区国营畜产公司和合作社积极开展收购畜产品的工作。拉卜楞和旧城两地畜产公司今年一月份至八月份已收购羊毛九十四万四千多斤，牛皮和各种野生皮四万七千多张。各畜产公司在收购工作方面都有很大改进。拉卜楞畜产公司简化了收购手续，并和贸易公司、银行等单位联合成立办公室，使牧民能及时出售畜产品和买到生活用品，可以当日启程返家。旧城畜产公司为了照顾远地来的牧民，随到随收，并向他们介绍当地物价，帮助他们到贸易公司购货，还利用座谈会等形式，经常向牧民进行宣传，征求对收购工作的意见。
    甘南藏族自治区除产皮毛外，并盛产麝香、鹿茸、大黄、党参等数十种药材。现在正是挖采药材季节，当地各贸易单位正准备大量收购，并对药材产量、产地、质量进行了调查，订出了收购计划，同时还派干部到牧区宣传收购价格、规格，组织牧民大量挖采。（新华社）
