    State-owned Grain Departments Must Rely on Cooperatives to Fulfill the State Grain Procurement Plan

    Close cooperation and coordination between state-owned grain departments and cooperatives, forming a strong procurement force, is an important guarantee for doing a good job in grain procurement. The fact that the state-owned grain departments and cooperatives in Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province, closely cooperated and supported each other, completing 199% of the annual wheat procurement task in June, July, and August, an increase of 170% over last year's total procurement, is a case in point.

    Some cadres in state-owned grain departments and cooperatives in some areas, due to a lack of overall perspective and the existence of capitalist business ideology, only know how to simply calculate profits and losses, and are unwilling to assist each other and develop together, even repelling each other. For example, in terms of procurement scope, some grain departments restrict the activities of cooperatives in many ways. In this year's wheat procurement in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, the grain department stipulated that cooperatives were only allowed to have thirteen procurement points, and each procurement point must be more than ten miles away from the grain department's procurement points. The grain department in Shangqiu Prefecture, Henan Province, allowed private merchants to procure at more than 800 locations, while only entrusting cooperatives with more than 200 purchase points, and did not allow cooperatives to bring goods to the countryside when procuring wheat. In terms of procurement handling fees, some cooperatives, under the pretext that grain procurement is troublesome and the handling fees are low, are not actively assisting the grain department in procurement. Cooperatives in Hengyang, Guiyang, and other places in Hunan Province did not assist the grain department in procurement but signed agency purchase contracts with private merchants, charging a 5% handling fee, and competed with the grain department in the market by raising prices. The grain department in Tongxu County, Henan Province, paid private merchants a 2% higher handling fee for agency purchases than it paid cooperatives. In some areas, although grain departments and cooperatives signed agency purchase contracts, cadres in the grain departments held the attitude of "the cooperative is responsible for good or bad, and things will be handled according to the contract in the future," neglecting business guidance, help, and support to the cooperatives. Last year, when the grain department in Naxi County, Sichuan Province, entrusted cooperatives to purchase new grain, the agency purchase contract became a mere formality because the cadres in the grain department did not help the cooperative cadres with specific business matters, and the agency purchase work was suspended. As a result, the agency purchase grain only accounted for 5.7% of the grain department's procurement performance. Some cooperative cadres also believe that they have accepted the task of agency purchase entrusted by the grain department, and it is enough to complete the task, taking an attitude of indifference to the situation and problems in the procurement, thus weakening the procurement force.

    As a result of these wrong practices, the political and economic losses are great. For example, because state-owned grain departments and cooperatives cannot divide labor well in terms of procurement scope and cannot work together to carry out procurement work, some areas have insufficient procurement forces, and the masses line up to sell grain, crowded and overwhelmed, wasting farmers' labor and time, and delaying farmers' production; some areas are still blank spots, unable to meet the purchase and sale needs of farmers; and even create opportunities for unscrupulous merchants to suppress prices and exploit farmers, causing farmers to suffer avoidable losses. More seriously, because state-owned grain departments and cooperatives cannot closely cooperate and coordinate procurement, the state's grain purchase plan is affected, and the leadership role in the market is weakened. If this wrong practice is not corrected quickly, it will be unfavorable to the country and the people.

    Therefore, criticizing capitalist business ideology and strengthening the overall concept and policy education are important links in improving the relationship between state-owned grain departments and cooperatives and jointly completing the grain purchase task. State-owned commercial cadres should recognize that cooperatives are now economic organizations of the farmers themselves, spread throughout the major market towns, and have the closest ties with the masses of farmers. They are a powerful assistant to state-owned commerce. It is their responsibility to rely on and help cooperatives so that they can fully play their due role in state commercial activities (including grain purchase work). At the same time, cooperative cadres should also recognize that supplying the needs of the state, actively completing various tasks entrusted by the state (including grain purchase tasks), respecting the business leadership of state-owned commercial departments, and fully playing the role of a powerful assistant to the state-owned economy are their due responsibilities to the state and the basis for developing cooperative business. Based on this correct understanding, in terms of procurement scope, the division of labor between grain departments and cooperatives should be based on the principle of facilitating farmers and promoting the policy of vigorous procurement. Generally speaking, state-owned grain departments should focus on mastering the grain distribution markets in large and medium-sized cities and major county towns, while cooperatives should focus on the procurement in small county towns and primary markets below the county level. In the rice markets where both state-owned grain departments and cooperatives have procurement or where neither has procurement, or in areas where cooperatives are weak, the same-level financial and economic committees should handle them in a unified manner. At present, special attention should be paid to equipping forces for procurement in the vast rural primary markets. Procurement handling fees should be handled in accordance with economic principles, and procurement funds should be allocated to cooperatives with confidence and steadily. It is necessary to prevent the phenomenon of disconnection due to insufficient funds. Cooperatives should improve work efficiency, simplify procurement procedures, facilitate farmers, save costs, and actively complete the state's grain purchase plan. In addition, state-owned grain departments must also provide assistance to cooperatives in warehousing, transportation, and technical aspects of identifying grain quality. In short, grain departments and cooperatives must trust and help each other, and under the principle of being conducive to procurement, closely coordinate every procurement link between the two parties. Only in this way can the grain selling requirements of farmers be met, which is conducive to the completion of this year's state grain purchase plan.

    国营粮食部门必须依靠合作社完成国家收购粮食的计划
    国营粮食部门和合作社充分合作，密切配合，结成强大的收购力量，这是做好粮食收购工作的一个重要保证。河南新乡专区国营粮食部门和合作社密切合作，互相支援，在六、七、八三个月内完成了全年收购小麦任务百分之一百九十九，比去年收购总数增加百分之一百七十。就是一个例证。
    有些地区的国营粮食部门和合作社的干部，由于缺乏整体观念，存在着资本主义经营思想，只知单纯计算盈亏，而不愿互相协助，共同发展，甚至互相排斥。譬如在收购范围方面，有些粮食部门多方限制合作社的活动。湖北省孝感县粮食部门在今年收购小麦中，规定合作社只准有十三个收购点，每个收购点又必须在粮食部门收购点的周围十里以外。河南省商邱专区粮食部门允许私商在八百多处收购，而委托合作社的代购点却只有二百多个，并且不准合作社在收购小麦时带货下乡。在收购手续费等方面，有些合作社藉口收购粮食麻烦，手续费少，不积极协助粮食部门收购。湖南衡阳、桂阳等地合作社不协助粮食部门收购而与私商订立代购合同，取手续费百分之五，在市场上与粮食部门抬价争购。河南省通许县粮食部门，委托私商代购的手续费比委托合作社代购的手续费多百分之二。也有些地区的粮食部门和合作社虽订立了代购合同，但粮食部门的干部抱着“好坏由合作社负责，将来按合同办事”的态度，忽视了对合作社在业务上的指导、帮助和支持，四川纳溪县粮食部门去年委托合作社收购新粮时，就因为粮食部门干部不从具体业务上去帮助合作社干部，使代购合同流于形式，代购工作陷于停顿，结果代购粮只占粮食部门收购实绩的百分之五点七，也有些合作社干部认为自己已接受了粮食部门委托代购的任务，只要完成任务就算完事，对收购中的情况和问题采取不闻不问的态度，因而削弱了收购力量。
    由于这些错误做法的结果，在政治上和经济上的损失是很大的。譬如由于国营粮食部门和合作社在收购范围方面不能很好分工，不能同心协力开展收购工作，有些地区收购力量不足，群众排队售粮，拥挤不堪，浪费了农民的劳力和时间，耽搁了农民的生产；也有些地区仍然是空白点，不能满足农民的购销要求；甚至给奸商造成了杀价收购、剥削农民的机会，使农民遭受了原可避免的损失。更严重的，由于国营粮食部门和合作社不能密切配合，协同收购，因而影响了国家购粮计划，削弱了对市场的领导作用。这种错误的做法如果不迅速予以纠正，对国家和对人民都是不利的。
    因此，批判资本主义经营思想，加强整体观念和政策教育，是改进国营粮食部门和合作社的关系、合力完成购粮任务的重要一环。国营商业干部应该认识，合作社目前已经是遍及各重要集镇的农民自己的经济组织，和农民群众的联系最为密切，它是国营商业的有力助手。依靠和帮助合作社，使它在国家商业活动（包括购粮工作）中充分发挥应有的作用，乃是自己的责任。同时，合作社干部也应该认识：供应国家需要，积极完成国家委托的各项任务（包括购粮任务），尊重国家商业部门在业务上的领导，充分发挥国营经济有力的助手作用，这是对国家应有的责任，也是发展合作社业务的基础。在这个正确认识的基础上，在收购范围方面，粮食部门和合作社的分工，应该以便利农民，有利于贯彻大力收购的方针为原则。一般说，国营粮食部门以掌握大中城市和主要县城的粮食集散市场的收购为主，合作社则应以小县城及县以下的初级市场的收购为主，在国营粮食部门和合作社双方都有或双方都没有收购的稻谷市场，或合作社力量薄弱地区，则应由同级财政经济委员会加以统一处理。在目前，尤应对广大农村初级市场注意配备力量收购。收购手续费应遵守经济的原则办事，收购资金应放心地源源拨给合作社，必须防止因资金不足发生脱购现象。而合作社应提高工作效率，简化收购手续，便利农民，节省费用，积极完成国家购粮计划。此外，国营粮食部门还必须在仓储、运输以及鉴别粮食品质技术等方面给合作社帮助。总之，粮食部门和合作社必须互相信任，互相帮助，在有利于收购原则下，使双方每一个收购环节都紧密地配合起来，只有这样，才能满足农民售粮要求，有利于今年国家购粮计划的完成。
