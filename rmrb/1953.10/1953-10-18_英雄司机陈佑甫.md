Hero Driver Chen Youfu
Song Qun

    Sixty thousand eight hundred and thirty-four kilometers of safe driving – this is not a simple number.
    Here, there are no smooth, flat asphalt roads like in the cities, nor the strong sunlight during the day and dazzling streetlights at night. There are no traffic police responsible for directing traffic safely. Here, there are only muddy roads in the steep mountains and valleys of Korea, pitch-black nights, and bombs dropped by enemy planes constantly tracking you.
    Chen Youfu, this heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army truck driver, under these conditions, from February 1951 to early December, drove his first truck and completed a journey of more than 10,000 kilometers. Then, from December 19, 1951, to July 25, 1953, in 414 working days, he drove another truck and created this miraculous number – sixty thousand eight hundred and thirty-four kilometers.
    In February 1951, Chen Youfu joined the Volunteer Army and came to the Korean battlefield. At that time, in terms of driving skills, he was a novice. Enemy planes were frantically strafing and bombing along the roads, attempting to cut off the Volunteer Army's transportation lines. Chen Youfu began his struggle under those circumstances.
    His superiors repeatedly assigned tasks, some long distances, some short; the things he transported were sometimes light, sometimes heavy. But for Chen Youfu, it was all the same: the front line needed food, guns needed ammunition; comrades needed cotton clothing in winter and light clothing in summer. His task was to deliver these things quickly.
    During the Fifth Campaign, once, he was assigned to load shells at a railway station. After dark, his truck had just been loaded with shells when enemy planes came, without circling, and dropped napalm bombs. Flames shot onto Chen Youfu's cotton-padded clothing, onto the tarpaulin covering the shells, and onto the driver's cab. As Chen Youfu agilely took off his cotton-padded clothing and tore off the tarpaulin from the shells, the enemy plane circled back. He didn't have time to extinguish the fire on the driver's cab, so he immediately jumped into the driver's seat, drove the burning truck out of the railway station, and only stopped by the side of the road more than two li away. He then pulled down the burning tarpaulin on the driver's cab. After the fire was extinguished, he continued to drive for more than twenty li, when he heard a hissing sound again. Looking back, he saw that the remaining embers that hadn't been extinguished were burning the shell boxes. Flames were shooting out of the shell boxes, and the shells inside could explode at any moment. Chen Youfu jumped onto the burning shell box, picked up the burning mass, threw it to the ground, and covered it with sand, extinguishing the fire.
    Another time, he was assigned to deliver shells to a certain place, and his superiors wanted him to deliver them on time. Under normal circumstances, it would have been easy to complete the 190-kilometer journey within the allotted time. However, there was a stretch of enemy-controlled territory on the road, and that day happened to have a very bright moon. As they drove to a small bridge in the blocked area, enemy planes spotted them and swooped down. The truck body shook violently, and two shells exploded on either side of the truck. Two of the four tires at the rear of the truck were damaged, and his assistant, Comrade Zhang Wenzhen, was wounded in the chest. He quickly used a first-aid kit to bandage his assistant, drove the damaged truck out of the blocked area, changed the tires, and proceeded at the fastest speed. Although he was delayed for more than an hour along the way, he still arrived at his destination on time.
    These were all things that happened at the beginning. These miracles were created by courage alone.
    At that time, he still lacked experience driving at night and fighting enemy planes.
    Afterward, Chen Youfu drove his truck back and forth, running across high mountains and plains, seeing all kinds of enemy planes, and learning how to deal with all kinds of enemy planes. Later, Chen Youfu drove his truck out on missions every night as freely as a fish in water. The enemy's activities seemed to be completely controlled by this truck driver. He knew when the enemy planes would come and what methods to use to deal with them.
    One day, driving from a certain place on a mission, there was a stretch of plains on the road. When he got there, enemy planes came. He didn't even stop, but instead sped up even faster. The plane followed closely behind the truck. When the truck drove to a small undulating area, the enemy plane swooped down, and Chen Youfu slammed on the brakes. The truck drove to the side of the road, and a series of bombs exploded in front of the truck. The plane turned around, and Chen Youfu started the truck and moved forward again.
    Chen Youfu's current truck was received in December 1952 and hasn't undergone a major overhaul since. The wooden planks at the back of the truck have more than forty small holes pierced by shrapnel, and the green paint is covered with mud. Looking at the outside, it's a bit old. However, every part of the truck's engine is still like new.
    When driving at night on mountain roads, he carefully drove over every uneven spot, carefully turning the steering wheel, afraid of turning too sharply and damaging the parts. Whenever he took a break during the journey, he would jump out and personally inspect the truck from front to back, adding water when necessary and lubricating oil when necessary. During the day, he camouflaged the truck properly. He established a fixed "three checks" system for himself: Before each trip, he would thoroughly check the truck from beginning to end before driving. After driving twenty or thirty kilometers, he would check it again. When he arrived at his destination, he would check it thoroughly again. If he found any problems, he would repair them without even eating. He often said to his assistant, "The truck is the best truck. If you take care of it normally, it will take care of you in an emergency."
    Except when the truck was hit by enemy planes, he almost never broke down on the road due to inflexible parts. If the truck made even a slight noise, he would find the problem and fix it immediately. He knew that he could dodge and run when enemy planes came, but if the truck wasn't flexible, everything would be in vain. Therefore, in his spare time, he would study the truck's original manual. If he didn't recognize the characters, he would study the diagrams. During air raid shelters, he would chat with other drivers traveling together. In this way, he quickly became familiar with the business and improved his skills.
    Chen Youfu not only cherished his own truck, but he also cherished the trucks of other comrades. On the road, if he encountered another truck that had broken down, he would always go down to help. Once, a jeep from a certain unit overturned into a ditch, and many people helped push it, but they couldn't get it up. He happened to be passing by. It was almost dawn, and if they didn't quickly drive to their destination, the truck would be damaged if enemy planes came. He immediately slammed on the brakes, tied a rope, and helped pull the jeep up before continuing to drive forward. Afterward, the leaders of that unit wrote a special letter to commend him.
    Chen Youfu, along with other truck drivers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, drove his truck to further consolidate the Volunteer Army's steel transportation line. His truck was offered by the people of the motherland, and every part was permeated with the strength of the people. He added his own steel will, making this truck, this transportation line, a transportation line that no enemy could cut off.
    This year, on National Day, hero truck driver Chen Youfu, who was awarded the Special Merit and the Korean First-Class Warrior Honor Medal, came to the capital of the motherland with the Volunteer Army delegation to attend the National Day celebrations. He participated in the National Day celebrations with immense excitement and saw his beloved leader Chairman Mao. He said, "In order to strive for the complete victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and to respond to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, I must cherish vehicles even more in the future and strive for safe driving to 100,000 kilometers."

    英雄司机陈佑甫
    宋　群
    安全行车六万零八百三十四公里，这不是一个简单的数字。
    这里没有城市里的光滑平坦的柏油马路，也没有白天强烈的阳光和夜间耀眼的路灯，更没有负责安全指挥的交通警察；这里有的是朝鲜峻岭峡谷中的泥路，漆黑的夜晚，和敌人飞机随时跟踪投下来的炸弹。
    陈佑甫，这个英雄的中国人民志愿军汽车司机，就在这种情况下，从一九五一年二月到十二月初，驾驶着他的第一辆汽车完成了一万多公里的行程；接着，从一九五一年的十二月十九日到一九五三年的七月二十五日，在四百一十四个工作日中，他又驾驶着另一辆汽车，创造了这个奇迹般的数字——六万零八百三十四公里。
    一九五一年的二月，陈佑甫参加志愿军来到了朝鲜战场。那时，讲驾驶技术，他是个生手；敌人飞机疯狂地沿着公路扫射轰炸，企图切断志愿军的运输线。陈佑甫就在那种情况下开始了他的斗争。
    上级一次次地交来任务，路程有远的，有近的；所运的东西有轻的，也有重的。但对陈佑甫讲来，这都一样：火线上人要粮食，枪炮要弹药；同志们冬天要棉衣，夏天要单衣，自己的任务就是迅速地把这些东西送上去。
    第五次战役时，一次，他被指定到一个火车站上去装运炮弹。天黑以后，他的汽车刚刚装满了炮弹，敌机来了，没有绕圈子，就把凝固汽油弹扔了下来。火焰喷射到陈佑甫的棉衣上，喷射到盖炮弹的帆布上和驾驶棚上。当陈佑甫敏捷地脱掉棉衣，扯下炮弹上的帆布时敌机又绕了回来，他来不及再去扑灭驾驶棚上的火了，于是他就立即跳进驾驶仓，开着带火的汽车，冲出火车站，直到离火车站二里多地的公路边，才停下车，把驾驶棚上着火的帆布拉了下来。火扑灭以后，继续前进了二十多里，他又听到咝咝的声音。回头一看，原来是未被扑灭的残火烧着了炮弹箱子。炮弹箱子上吐着火舌，里边的炮弹随时都可能爆炸。陈佑甫一纵身，跳到燃烧着的炮弹箱上，抱起这一团火，往地下一扔，用砂土盖上，火灭了。
    另一次，他被指定到某地送炮弹，上级要他准时送到。按照平常的情况，在规定的时间内跑完一百九十公里的路程，是宽裕的。可是，这条路上有一段敌人的封锁地区，那天恰好又有很亮的月亮。当他们刚开到封锁地一座小桥边，敌机发现了他们，俯冲下来，车身一下剧烈震动，两颗炮弹在车两边爆炸了。车后边的四个轮带，有两个被打坏了，助手张文珍同志的胸部也负了伤。他急忙用救急包给助手包好，将负伤的汽车开出封锁圈后，换了轮带，又用最快的速度前进。这样，中途虽然耽误了一个多小时，但，仍然还是按时到达了目的地。
    这些都是开始的事情，这只是凭着勇敢创造出来的奇迹。
    那时，他还缺乏黑夜开车的经验，也还缺乏与敌机斗争的经验。
    以后，陈佑甫开着他那辆汽车一趟又一趟地跑着，跑过高山，也跑过平原；见到了各式各样的敌机，也学会了对付各式各样敌机的办法。后来，陈佑甫每天夜间驾驶着他那辆车子出去执行任务，就好像鱼在水里那样运用自如。敌机的活动似乎完全操纵在这个汽车司机的手里一样。他知道甚么时候敌机会来，也知道用甚么办法来对付它。
    有一天，从某地开车执行任务，路上有一段平原，开到这里，敌机来了。他连停也没停，反而更加快地向前开。飞机紧跟在车后边。当车子开到一个小起伏地时，敌机一俯冲，陈佑甫猛地一煞车，车开在公路旁边，一连串的炸弹在汽车的前面白响了。飞机一转弯，陈佑甫又开起车子前进了。
    陈佑甫现在驾驶的这辆车子，从一九五二年十二月间领来，到现在没经过一次大修。车子的后面木板上，有四十多个弹片穿透的小孔，绿色的油漆也被泥土盖住了，看外面，是有些旧了。但是，打开汽车机器的每一部分，还像新的一样。
    在山路上夜间开车，他小心地过每一个凹凸的地方，小心地打转舵轮转弯，唯恐转急了伤着零件。行车中一休息，他就跳下来，亲自前前后后的检查一遍，该上水就上水，该擦油的就擦油。一到白天，就把汽车伪装得好好的。他自己规定了一个固定的“三查”制度：每次出车以前，他都要从头到尾地把车子检查一遍，再开车。车开出二三十公里以后，他又检查一遍。到达目的地，他再彻底检查一遍。发现了毛病，他连饭也不吃，就进行修理。他常对助手说：“汽车是最好的汽车，你平时爱护它，紧急的时候它就爱护你。”
    除了遇到敌机打着车子的情况，他几乎从没有在路上因为零件运用不灵活抛过锚。汽车稍微有点杂音，他就找出毛病来，立时修好了。他知道敌机来了还可以躲躲、跑跑，可汽车要使不灵活，就啥都白搭了。所以，平时，他有空就对照汽车上原来带有的说明书来琢磨。字不认识，他就对照着图样来钻研；防空隐蔽的时候，他和一起行车的司机在一起扯扯。这样，他就很快熟习了业务，提高了技术。
    陈佑甫不仅爱护自己这辆车子，他也爱护其他同志的车。路上，他碰到别人的车子抛锚了，他总得下去帮助。有一次，某部的一辆吉普车翻到沟里去了，好多人帮助推也推不上来。正好他经过这里。那时天快亮了，如果不快些开到目的地，敌机来了，车子就会受到损失。他立即煞住车子，结好绳子，帮助把这辆吉普车拖上来了，然后才继续向前开去。事后，某部首长特别写信来表扬他。
    陈佑甫和中国人民志愿军其他汽车司机在一起，开着他的车子，来更加巩固了志愿军的钢铁的运输线。他的车子，是祖国人民献出的，每个零件都渗透了人民的力量，他又把自己钢铁的意志加进去，使这辆车，这条运输线，成为任何敌人也不能切断的运输线。
    今年国庆节，荣立特等功荣获朝鲜一级战士荣誉勋章的英雄汽车司机陈佑甫，随着志愿军归国观礼代表团，来到祖国的首都。他以无限兴奋的心情参加了国庆节的观礼，看见了自己敬爱的领袖毛主席，他表示说，“为了争取抗美援朝的彻底胜利，为响应毛主席增产节约的号召，今后我一定要更加爱护车辆，争取安全行车到十万公里。”
