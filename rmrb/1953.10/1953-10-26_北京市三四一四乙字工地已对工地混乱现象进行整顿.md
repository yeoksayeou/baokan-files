    Beijing Third Construction Company, Third, Fourth, One, Four, B Construction Site Rectifies Chaotic Conditions
    Lin Bao-hong, Technical Director of the Third, Fourth, One, Four, B Construction Site of the Beijing Fourth Construction Engineering Company, writes: The criticisms of our construction site raised in the "Reader's Visit" published in the People's Daily on September 8th are completely correct. We have taken urgent measures to correct the chaotic conditions on the site.
    Our construction site began preparatory work on June 26th. Due to a lack of in-depth investigation and research of materials during the preparation period, the on-site design did not match the actual terrain, bringing many avoidable difficulties and losses to the progress of the project. Particularly serious examples include the stockpiling of timber and lime and the construction of workers' sheds in low-lying areas, resulting in water accumulation after rain, difficulties for workers' housing, and losses in manpower and materials. In addition, due to poor overall material preparation planning, there was also the phenomenon of misappropriating facing board materials for the wasteful construction of worker's sheds.
    The above facts profoundly illustrate that my work was not thorough. I "limited" myself to the office and did not go deeply into reality to rely on the masses. The reader's criticism made me seriously examine my shortcomings and I am determined to work hard to overcome them.
    Our construction site began rectification work in September, mobilizing the masses to check for waste and lack of responsibility, and began to establish an administrative responsibility system and a technical responsibility system.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京市三四一四乙字工地已对工地混乱现象进行整顿
    北京市第四建筑工程公司三四一四乙字工地技术主任林宝泓来信：人民日报九月八日所登“读者来访”对我们工地提出的批评是完全正确的。我们已采取紧急措施纠正现场的混乱现象。
    我们工地在六月二十六日开始筹备工作。由于筹备期间没有深入调查情况和研究资料，以致现场设计与实际地形不相符合，给工程的进展带来了很多本来可以避免的困难和损失。其中特别严重的，如在低洼地带堆放木材、石灰和搭建工棚，以致雨后积水，工人住处发生困难，人力物力受到损失。此外，由于全面备料计划做得不好，又发生了挪用工程望板材料造成工棚的浪费现象。
    以上事实，深刻地说明了我的工作是不深入的。我把自己“限制”在办公室里，没有很好地深入实际，依靠群众。读者对我的批评，使我认真地检查了自己的缺点，并决心努力加以克服。
    我们工地已在九月份进行整顿工作，发动群众检查了浪费及无人负责现象，并着手建立行政责任制及技术责任制。
