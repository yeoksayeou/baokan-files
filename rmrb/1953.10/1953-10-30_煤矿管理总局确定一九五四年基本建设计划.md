The Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry recently held a planning conference and determined the basic construction plan for 1954. In 1953, basic coal mine construction focused primarily on coking coal, followed by general industrial coal and civilian coal. In 1954, based on the state's requirements for coal, the Coal Mine Management Bureau proposed a new policy: not only to meet the needs of steel coking and general industrial coal, but also to meet the needs of civilian coal and export coal.

Currently, the situation of basic coal mine construction is extremely disproportionate to the basic construction tasks. For example, resource exploration lags behind, design work is weak, plans change frequently, the use of forces is scattered, construction is loose at the beginning and tight at the end, and there is a lack of economic accounting. As a result, the tasks are not well completed.

In order to solve the contradiction between basic construction forces and tasks and avoid the phenomenon of being greedy and rushing forward, the Coal Mine Bureau proposed the following measures: concentrate the use of forces, advance exploration and design; renovate mines with careful calculations.

Concentrating the use of forces (including funds, exploration, design, equipment, construction forces, etc.) means first grasping the "strategic base" projects of the coal mines stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. Grasp the mine projects that have already undergone exploration and have design drawings and equipment. For these projects, concentrate absolutely superior forces to ensure rapid completion. In 1954, coal mines will use more than 60 percent of their funds for mine projects, and 60 percent of this force will be placed on several pairs of mine projects that will be transferred to production next year. In geological exploration work, in 1953, forces were scattered on more than 40 well fields, and as a result, data could not be fully delivered, delaying design. In 1954, geology and drilling are required to cooperate well and complete one piece and hand it over to avoid the continued occurrence of design idleness and uneven workload. In 1953, design work was scattered on 85 mines and 178 major projects, and as a result, data could not be fully delivered in the first half of the year, and some major projects fell through. In 1954, it is required to concentrate the existing forces on several mines with geological data, and adopt the same method of completing one piece and handing it over to avoid "advancing simultaneously" and strive to deliver design drawings one after another this winter and next spring. In terms of construction organization, the forces are scattered in 49 engineering companies, the forces are unbalanced, and the "combat" is weak. In 1954, it is required to merge and organize three to four regular "field army groups" and five to six "local main force army groups" around new mines and large renovation project areas to ensure the completion of major projects.

In the case that new mines have not been completed and the state is in urgent need of coal, it is only necessary to ask the existing mines to bear more. Those existing mines that can produce more should produce more, and those that need to be renovated before they can produce more should be renovated immediately. When renovating mines, it is necessary to make careful calculations and oppose blindly doing things. The Tonghua Iron Plant Mine required an investment of more than 100 billion yuan, but the mine can only be maintained for four years after the renovation. The lower part of the Zhonggang Mine has not been clarified, so it was renovated, but it can only be used as a ventilation shaft. These phenomena are caused by the failure to make careful calculations. It is now clearly determined that those with conditions should be renovated, those without conditions should be postponed, those that are cost-effective should be renovated, and those that are not cost-effective should be postponed. In short, it is required that mine renovation should also achieve the goals of good, fast, and economical.

Geological data and design work are prerequisites for coal mine construction. Due to the lag in these two tasks, the plan was not practical, which resulted in the inability to start construction in the first half of 1953, wasting 16 billion yuan in idle work costs; the budget work was not done well before preparing materials, resulting in material backlog costs of as much as 300 billion yuan. The losses caused by the "rush work" carried out in the second half of the year to complete the construction task are even incalculable. This situation must be reversed in 1954, and we must strive to carry out basic construction in accordance with the construction procedures in 1955. Therefore, it is required to advance geological exploration work to two years before construction and design work to half a year in 1954. Within three to two years, advance the exploration work by five to six years and the design work by one year.

The meeting pointed out that the task in 1954 is arduous, and it is a year of great transformation in basic coal mine construction work. Any ideas of passively waiting are wrong. It is necessary to rely on and unite all employees to work together to complete this glorious and arduous task.

### 煤矿管理总局确定一九五四年基本建设计划

    煤矿管理总局确定一九五四年基本建设计划
    中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局最近召开了计划会议，确定了一九五四年的基本建设计划。一九五三年煤矿基本建设是以炼焦用煤为主，其次是一般工业用煤和民用煤。一九五四年根据国家对煤炭的要求，煤矿管理总局提出了新的方针：不仅要满足钢铁炼焦和一般工业用煤，而且要满足民用煤以及出口煤的需要。
    目前煤矿基本建设的情况与基本建设任务是极不相称的，如资源勘查落后，设计工作薄弱，计划变动频繁，使用力量分散，施工前松后紧，缺乏经济核算等。因此任务完成得不好。
    为解决基本建设力量和任务的矛盾，避免发生贪多冒进的现象，煤矿总局提出如下措施：集中使用力量，提前勘查设计；改建矿井要精打细算。
    集中使用力量（包括资金、勘查、设计、设备、施工力量等）就是首先要抓住五年计划中规定煤矿的“战略基地”工程。抓住已经经过勘查，已经有了设计图纸和设备的矿井工程。对这些工程要集中绝对优势力量，保证迅速完成。一九五四年煤矿将百分之六十以上的资金用于矿井工程，又将其中百分之六十力量放在明年移交生产的几对矿井工程上。地质勘查工作，一九五三年将力量分散在四十多处井田上，结果不能全部交出资料，耽误了设计。一九五四年要求地质和钻探很好的配合，完成一件交一件，以免继续发生设计窝工和闲忙不均的现象。设计工作一九五三年分散在八十五个矿井和一百七十八件主要工程上，结果上半年不能全部交出资料，有些主要工程落了空。一九五四年，要求将现有力量集中在有地质资料的几处矿井上，同样采取完成一件交一件的办法，避免“齐头并进”，争取能在今冬与明春陆续交出设计图纸。在施工组织方面，力量分散在四十九个工程公司中，力量不平衡，“战斗”无力。一九五四年，要求围绕着新建矿井和大的改造工程区，合并组织三个至四个正规的“野战化兵团”，五个至六个“地方主力兵团”。以保证完成主要工程。
    在新建矿井尚未完成，国家又急于要煤的情况下，只有要求现有的矿井多担负些，现有的矿井能多出的多出，需要经过改造后才能多出者即行改造。改造矿井时，必须精打细算，反对盲目乱干。通化铁厂矿要求千亿余元的投资，改造后矿井只能维持四年。中岗矿井的下部尚未弄清楚，就进行改造，结果只能当做通风井用。这些现象都是因为不会精打细算而造成的。现在明确确定有条件者改造，无条件者缓办，合算者改造，不合算者暂缓。总之要求矿井改造也要达到好、快、省的目的。
    地质资料与设计工作是煤矿建设的先决条件，由于这两项工作落后，计划不切合实际，致使一九五三年上半年工程不能开工，浪费了一百六十亿元的窝工费用；预算工作没有作好就开始备料，结果材料积压费用达三千亿元之多，在下半年为完成建设任务所进行的“抢工”造成的损失更是无法计算。一九五四年必须扭转这种情况，争取在一九五五年能按照建设程序进行基本建设。因此要求在一九五四年将地质勘查工作提到建设前二年，设计工作提前半年。在三、二年内将勘查工作提前五至六年，将设计工作提前一年。
    会议指出，一九五四年的任务是艰巨的，是煤矿基本建设工作大转变的一年，任何消极等待的思想都是错误的，必须依靠与团结全体职工共同努力，才有可能完成这个光荣而又艰巨的任务。
