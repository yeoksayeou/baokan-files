    Winter Uniforms Sewn by Northeast Workers for the Volunteer Army Have Been Shipped to Korea
    [Xinhua News Agency] Workers in clothing factories in Northeast China have completed their task of sewing winter clothing for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army ahead of schedule. Now, all of these winter clothes have been sent to Korea.

    After accepting the task of sewing winter clothing for the Volunteer Army, workers in clothing factories in Northeast China enthusiastically launched red banner competitions, and actively sought methods and improved their skills to ensure that the winter clothing was made exquisitely and sturdily, and delivered to the Volunteer Army early. Workers in one factory invented a mechanical cotton wadding machine, which increased the efficiency of cotton wadding by eight times, making the wadding even and saving cotton. Many factories actively improved production methods, enabling the completion of this year's winter clothing sewing task one month earlier than last year.

    Commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who promptly received the new winter clothing, wrote letters expressing their gratitude to the people of the motherland. Zhao Licai, of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, said in a letter to the people of the motherland: "Before the arrival of the cold winter, we received the new cotton clothes sent by the people of the motherland. Everyone says that this year's cotton clothes are very sturdy, comfortable to wear, and the style is also very good. The comrades unanimously expressed: Wearing the new cotton clothes from the people of the motherland, we must, according to the wishes of the people of the motherland, be more vigilant in defending peace and helping the Korean people restore and develop their economy."

    东北工人为志愿军缝制的冬装已运到朝鲜
    【新华社讯】东北地区各被服厂工人，提前完成了为中国人民志愿军缝制冬季服装的任务。现在，这些冬季服装已全部送到朝鲜。
    东北地区各被服厂的工人们，接受了为志愿军缝制冬季服装的任务后，热烈展开红旗竞赛，并积极地找窍门和提高技术，保证把冬季服装做得又精致又结实，提早送给志愿军。某工厂工人，发明了机械絮花机，使絮花效率提高八倍，絮的既匀又节省棉花。许多工厂都积极改进了生产方法，使今年冬季服装缝制任务较去年提早一个月完成。
    及时收到新冬装的中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员，纷纷写信感谢祖国人民。志愿军某部赵理财在写给祖国人民的信中说：“在寒冬未来临的时候，我们就收到了祖国人民送来的新棉衣。大家都说今年的棉衣很结实，穿起来很舒服，式样也很好。同志们一致表示：穿上祖国人民的新棉衣，一定要按祖国人民的愿望，更加警惕地保卫和平和帮助朝鲜人民恢复和发展经济。”
