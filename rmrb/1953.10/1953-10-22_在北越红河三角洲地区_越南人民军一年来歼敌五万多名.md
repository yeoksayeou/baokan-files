Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army issued a communique on the 19th, stating that in the period from July 1952 to July 1953, local troops, militia, and guerrillas of the Vietnamese People's Army in the Red River Delta region of North Vietnam fought a total of 5,070 battles, eliminating more than 52,000 enemy troops and forcing the enemy to withdraw from 162 strongholds.

The communique stated that over the past year, the People's Army and guerrillas in the enemy's rear in the Red River Delta of North Vietnam have successfully crushed many enemy "mopping-up operations" and continuously launched guerrilla warfare. They launched multiple raids, infiltrating important cities such as Haiphong, Kien An, Hai Duong, and Nam Dinh. Guerrilla areas and guerrilla bases have been consolidated and expanded, while enemy-occupied areas have relatively shrunk. For example, the guerrilla areas and guerrilla bases on the left bank of the Red River only accounted for one-half of the area in 1952, but have expanded to two-thirds this year. As a result of these victories, the People's Army has partially thwarted the enemy's plan to "pacify" the Red River Delta of North Vietnam.

The communique listed the People's Army's achievements during this period as follows:

(1) Eliminated more than 52,000 enemy troops, including 31,220 killed and 10,550 captured.

(2) Destroyed 1,628 enemy motorcycles, 58 tanks, 6 gunboats, 4 aircraft, 53 artillery pieces, 3 locomotives, 100 warehouses, and 259 tons of military equipment. Damaged 740 kilometers of highways, 95 bridges, and 1,472 kilometers of telephone lines.

(3) Captured 74 artillery pieces, 2,079 light and heavy machine guns, and 172 radio stations.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: TASS, 20th dispatch: On the 15th, French troops in Indochina launched a new offensive against the Vietnamese People's Army 50 miles south of Hanoi. Foreign newspapers touted this offensive as the "most powerful offensive in the seven-year war in Indochina."

According to Agence France-Presse, aircraft, armored vehicles, infantry, and paratroopers all participated in the battle. To contain the forces of the Vietnamese People's Army, French forces also landed at Cape Ronde 110 miles south of Thanh Hoa.

According to foreign news agencies, the French offensive was halted on October 18th due to the heroic resistance of the Vietnamese People's Army.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Cambodian People's Liberation Army has recently launched continuous attacks and achieved victories.

On August 17th, the Cambodian People's Liberation Army removed an enemy stronghold in Kampong Speu Province, west of the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, killing or wounding 49 enemy troops, including all the officers of the reinforcements sent from the capital of Kampong Speu Province. On September 8th, the Cambodian People's Liberation Army destroyed an enemy vehicle on the Kampot-Chuk highway south of Phnom Penh, killing five enemy troops, including a captain.

Due to the victories of the Cambodian People's Liberation Army, many Cambodian puppet soldiers deserted the enemy and surrendered to the People's Liberation Army, and many puppet soldiers mutinied and demanded demobilization.

    在北越红河三角洲地区
    越南人民军一年来歼敌五万多名
    【新华社二十一日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总司令部在十九日发表公报说：从一九五二年七月到一九五三年七月止的期间，北越红河三角洲地区的越南人民军地方部队、民兵和游击队一共作战五千零七十次，歼灭敌军五万二千多名，迫使敌军撤出一百六十二处据点。
    公报说：一年来，在敌后北越红河三角洲的人民军和游击队胜利地粉碎了敌人的多次“扫荡战”，不断展开游击战。他们曾发动了多次突袭，渗入过海防、建安、海阳、南定等一些重要城市。游击区和游击根据地巩固和扩展了，敌占区相对地缩小了。例如，红河左岸的游击区和游击根据地，在一九五二年仅占该地区面积二分之一，今年已扩展为三分之二。由于这些胜利，人民军已部分地粉碎了敌人企图“平定”北越红河三角洲的计划。
    公报列举人民军在这期间的战果如下：
    （一）歼灭敌军五万二千多名，其中击毙三万一千二百二十名，俘掳一万零五百五十名。
    （二）击毁敌军摩托车一千六百二十八辆、坦克五十八辆、炮艇六艘、飞机四架、大炮五十三门、机车三辆、仓库一百座、军事装备二百五十九吨。破坏公路七百四十公里、桥梁九十五座，破坏电话线路一千四百七十二公里。
    （三）缴获大炮七十四门，轻、重机枪两千零七十九挺，电台一百七十二部。
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社二十日讯：在印度支那的法国军队十五日在河内以南五十英里地方向越南人民军发动新攻势。外国报纸把这次攻势吹嘘成为印度支那的“七年战争中的最强有力的攻势”。
    据法新社报道，飞机、装甲车、步兵和伞兵都参加了这次战斗。为了牵制越南人民军的兵力，法军并在清化以南一百一十英里的伦德岬登陆。
    据外国通讯社报道，由于越南人民军进行了英勇的阻击，法军的进攻已在十月十八日被阻止。
    【新华社二十一日讯】据越南通讯社讯：高棉人民解放军最近不断出击获胜。
    高棉人民解放军在八月十七日拔除了高棉首都金边城以西磅实居省境内的一个敌军据点，杀伤敌军四十九名，其中包括从磅实居省省会调来的援军的全部军官。九月八日，高棉人民解放军在金边城以南的嗊吥—朱克公路上击毁敌军汽车一辆，打死敌军五名，其中有一个上尉。
    由于高棉人民解放军的胜利，许多高棉伪军背弃敌军向人民解放军投降，另有许多伪军哗变，要求复员。
