The victims in some disaster-stricken areas of Hebei Province have now been largely settled. The Party and government organs in the disaster-stricken areas are vigorously leading the masses in production self-salvation, and have achieved certain results.

After the floods in some areas of Hebei Province, the province immediately allocated 17.6 billion yuan and a portion of preferential treatment grain for emergency relief to solve the temporary food shortage of the victims. In areas where houses collapsed, in addition to mobilizing the masses to help each other, the provincial government allocated 12.8 billion yuan to help the victims build houses. In order to strongly support wheat planting in the disaster areas, the province also allocated a large number of wheat seeds, fertilizers, and livestock loans. In September, the Hebei Provincial Production and Disaster Relief Committee decided to lead the masses in developing various sideline productions, purchasing 2.4 million bolts of native cloth, 100 million jin of crude saltpeter, 1 million pockets, and 230,000 sacks in the disaster areas. The Provincial Cooperative and the Department of Commerce also formulated plans for supplying raw materials and purchasing products, assigning specific figures to the relevant production areas. The leaders in the disaster areas also focused on restoring transportation, calling on the victims to participate in transportation and increase sideline income. The Cangxian Special District issued loans of more than 14 billion yuan to help the victims solve production problems, and required all counties to formulate production and disaster relief work plans for this winter and next spring in conjunction with needs assessment. The Tianjin Special District formed a production and disaster relief office composed of 19 cadres from the Finance and Economics Committee, Civil Affairs Section, Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Bank, Grain Bureau, and Industry and Commerce Section to lead the victims in production self-salvation. Thanks to the vigorous leadership and support of the Party and government organs, sideline production in the disaster areas of Hebei has now achieved considerable results. In Renqiu County, Tianjin Special District, more than 2,100 people processed 4,870 bolts of native cloth and more than 3,400 pockets for the supply and marketing cooperative, earning more than 130 million yuan; in Jinghai County, more than 16,000 people participated in weaving mats, and 23 technical stations were established in one district to strengthen technical guidance; in the fourth district of Ninghe County, more than 6,700 people participated in sideline occupations such as fishing, twisting hemp, and weaving mats, generally earning 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per person per day, and up to 8,000 yuan. In Sushizhang Village, Nanhe County, Xingtai Special District, six flour mills have been organized, and it is also planned to open 12 tofu workshops and one silk mill, so that all labor forces in the village can find production opportunities. Fengnan County, Tangshan Special District, also organized various sideline productions such as fishing, transportation, tofu workshops, flour mills, and mat weaving according to different regions and different sideline foundations. For example, in Huanggezhuang and 27 other villages in the second district, more than 1,400 people participated in fishing. In Changli County, more than 1,000 people quarried stones, and in Sanguanmiao Village, Leting County, 160 households participated in willow weaving, each earning 7,000 to 8,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan per day. In Dabugou and three other townships in Kangbao County, Zhangjiakou Special District, 68 households participated in transportation, and have now earned more than 4.4 million yuan and more than four shi of naked oats. In the above-mentioned areas where production self-salvation has achieved results, the confidence and courage of the masses in overcoming disasters have been greatly strengthened. They said: As long as we do a good job in sideline production, we can definitely overcome the disasters.

In order to continue to support the victims in doing a good job in sideline production and carry out production self-salvation, the financial and economic departments of the province have generally formulated plans and purchased a large amount of local products. Cangxian and Tianjin Special Districts signed a contract with the Beijing Department Store Company to process 125,000 pairs of shoe soles. The Tianjin Dongya Sack Factory plans to purchase 4 million jin of green jute, and has sent special personnel to the production area to sign contracts. After the cooperative departments of Shijiazhuang Special District determined the monthly plan for purchasing local products, the county cooperatives have begun to purchase. In addition to purchasing more than 9 million yuan of straw braid and rice flour balls, Tianjin Special District also sent special personnel to the disaster area with 300 million yuan to purchase pigs and sheep. The Cangxian Cooperative has purchased a large number of local products such as fat pigs, sheep, pears, and cattail packages. Banks in various places have also begun to issue loans. The Tianjin Special District Bank has dispatched more than 300 cadres to go deep into the disaster areas, and has loaned more than 4 billion yuan to grassroots societies to replenish the funds for purchasing and selling sideline products. Shengfang Town issued loans of more than 50 million yuan to support mat weaving and ship repairing. Ninghe County has loaned more than 90 million yuan to support sideline productions such as basket weaving and net making. (Shang Jingcheng, Chen Wenwei)

    河北省部分受灾地区的灾民，现已大体安置就绪，受灾地区的党、政机关正大力领导群众生产自救，并获得了一定成绩。
    河北省部分地区水灾发生后，省里立即拨款一百七十六亿元及优抚粮一部分，进行急赈，解决灾民临时的缺粮困难。房屋倒塌的地区，除发动群众互助解决外，省府并拨款一百二十八亿元，扶助灾民修建房屋。为了大力支持灾区种麦，该省又拨出大批麦种、肥料、牲畜贷款。九月间，河北省生产救灾委员会决定领导群众开展多种多样的副业生产，在灾区收购土布二百四十万匹，皮硝一亿斤，口袋一百万条，麻袋二十三万条。省合作社及商业厅也作出供应原料、收购产品的计划，分配具体数字给各有关产区。灾区领导上并抓紧恢复交通，号召灾民参加运输，增加副业收入。沧县专区为帮助灾民解决生产上的困难，发放贷款一百四十余亿元，并要求各县结合摸底订出今冬明春的生产救灾工作计划。天津专区由财政经济委员会、民政科、供销社、银行、粮食局、工商科等部门，抽出十九名干部组成生产救灾办公室，领导灾民生产自救。由于党政机关的大力领导和支持，河北灾区的副业生产现已获得了不少成绩。天津专区的任邱县有二千一百多人给供销社加工土布四千八百七十匹、口袋三千四百多条，得利一亿三千余万元；静海县有一万六千多人参加织席，一区并建立了二十三处技术站，以加强技术指导；宁河县四区有六千七百多人参加捕鱼、捻麻、织席等副业，一般每天每人可得二、三千元，多者达八千元。邢台专区南和县苏石张村已组织六座粉坊，还计划开豆腐坊十二座，蚕丝坊一座，全村劳动力都可找到生产门路。唐山专区丰南县根据不同地区、不同副业基础也组织起捕鱼、运输、豆腐坊、粉坊、织席等多种副业生产。如二区黄各庄等二十七村有一千四百多人参加捕鱼。昌黎县有一千多人打石头，乐亭县三关庙村有一百六十户参加编柳，每人每天都可收入七、八千元至一万元。张家口专区康保县达布沟等三个乡，有六十八户参加运输，现已赚四百四十余万元，莜麦四石多。以上生产自救已获得成绩的地区，群众战胜灾荒的信心和勇气都大大加强，他们说：只要搞好副业生产，一定可以渡过灾荒。
    为了继续支持灾民搞好副业生产，进行生产自救，该省各财经部门已普遍订出计划并大量收购土产。沧县、天津两专区与北京市百货公司订立合同，加工鞋底十二万五千双，天津东亚麻袋厂计划收购青麻四百万斤，已派专人往产区签订合约。石家庄专区合作社部门确定了按月收购土产计划后，各县合作社已开始收购。天津专区除已收购九千余万元的草帽辫和粉团外，并派专人以三亿元赴灾区收购猪羊。沧县合作社已收购了肥猪、羊、梨、蒲包等大批土产。各地银行也开始发放贷款，天津专区银行抽派三百余名干部深入灾区，已贷给基层社四十余亿元，充实了收购和推销副业产品的资金。胜芳镇发放贷款五千余万元，扶植编席、修船。宁河县已贷出九千多万元，扶助编筐、制网等副业生产。　（商景澄、陈文伟）
