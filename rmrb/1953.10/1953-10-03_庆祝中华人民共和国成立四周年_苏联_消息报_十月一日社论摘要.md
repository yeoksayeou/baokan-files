　　In its editorial celebrating the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, "Izvestia" wrote: The Soviet people, the working people of the people's democratic countries, and all progressive humanity celebrate this historically significant day together with the Chinese people. In the four years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people have achieved very remarkable successes on their new path. The cause of national unification in China has been basically completed. Now only the residents of Taiwan Island and some other islands hope to get rid of the rule of the American occupying authorities and the American running dog Chiang Kai-shek. China has established a new democratic state system. The people's democratic united front, based on a strong alliance of workers and peasants and led by the militant Chinese working class, unites the Chinese people and guides their strength to strive for the common construction of a new life. The democratic reforms implemented by the people's government have changed the face of the country and the lives of the people. The historically significant land reform has been realized. Railways, many banks, and industrial and commercial enterprises were confiscated from the large monopoly bureaucratic bourgeoisie and became the property of the whole nation. The control and influence of foreign capital in China's finance, foreign trade, and other economic sectors has been resolutely eradicated, thus ending the brutal and ruthless plunder of the Chinese people by foreign capitalists, landlords, and large monopoly bourgeoisie. China's economic structure has changed: the state economic component has formed and grown into a powerful force; the cooperative component has emerged and is growing rapidly. The Chinese people have achieved great success in restoring the national economy. Agricultural production exceeded the highest pre-war level as early as 1952. Thanks to the selfless labor of the workers, by the beginning of 1953, the production of almost all sectors of light industry had exceeded the level of any previous period. The material well-being of the people has improved. This year, for the first time in Chinese history, democratic universal suffrage for representatives of the permanent organs of the people's government was held nationwide. The Chinese people have begun to implement the first five-year plan for national construction. The great achievements of the Chinese people are inseparable from the overall achievements of the democratic camp. These achievements are due to the heroic labor of the Chinese people and the selfless, fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union.

　　"Izvestia" continued: The construction of people's democratic China is carried out in the context of the fierce struggle between the Chinese people and the hostile conspiracies of world reactionaries, who are not reconciled to losing China forever. The Chinese people have consistently struggled to consolidate peace, thereby thwarting the conspiracies of the enemies of the freedom and independence of all peoples. The Chinese People's Volunteers, who went to aid the heroic Korean people against the intervention of American imperialism, accomplished immortal feats.

　　The achievements of the Chinese people arouse the anger and hatred of the instigators of new wars. The Chinese people's response to the new conspiracies of aggressive forces in the East is to strengthen the ties of friendship more closely with the Soviet Union, the countries of the democratic camp, and all peace-loving people.

　　"Izvestia" concluded: On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet people warmly congratulate the great Chinese people on achieving new successes in realizing the national industrialization plan, in developing agriculture and improving the people's welfare, and in further consolidating their people's democratic state with all their strength.

    庆祝中华人民共和国成立四周年
    ——苏联“消息报”十月一日社论摘要
    “消息报”在庆祝中华人民共和国成立四周年的社论中写道：苏联人民、人民民主国家劳动人民以及全体进步人类，和中国人民一起庆祝这个具有历史意义的日子。中国人民在中华人民共和国成立四年中，在自己新的道路上获得了非常显著的成就。中国全国统一的事业基本上是完成了。现在只有台湾岛和其他一些岛屿的居民期望着摆脱美国占领者当局和美国走狗蒋介石的统治。中国建立起新的民主国家制度。以强大的工农联盟为基础、以战斗的中国工人阶级为领导者的人民民主统一阵线，团结了中国人民，引导他们的力量为共同建设新生活而努力。人民政权实行的民主改革，改变了全国的面貌和人民的生活。具有历史意义的土地改革实现了。从大垄断官僚资产阶级手中没收了铁路、许多银行、工商企业，而变为全国的财产。外国资本在中国财政、对外贸易以及其他经济部门中的控制和势力已经被坚决铲除了，从而结束了外国资本家、地主和大垄断资产阶级对中国人民的蛮横无情的掠夺。中国的经济结构改变了：国家经济成分形成了，并且成长为强大的力量；合作社成分出现了，并且在迅速成长。中国人民在恢复国民经济方面获得了巨大的成就，农业生产早在一九五二年就超过了战前最高的水平。由于工人的忘我劳动，到一九五三年年初，差不多轻工业的一切部门的生产就超过了以往任何时候的水平。人民的物质福利提高了。今年中国有史以来第一次在全国范围内举行人民政权常设机构代表的民主普选。中国人民已着手执行国家建设的第一个五年计划。中国人民的伟大成就是和民主阵营的整个成就分不开的。这些成就的取得是由于中国人民的英勇劳动，是由于苏联对中国的无私的兄弟般的援助。
    “消息报”继续说：人民民主制的中国的建设，是在中国人民和世界反动派的敌对阴谋作激烈斗争的情况下进行的，世界反动派不甘心永远丢掉中国。中国人民一贯为巩固和平而斗争，从而打击了各国人民的自由和独立的敌人的阴谋。前往援助英雄的朝鲜人民反对美国帝国主义的干涉的中国人民志愿军，完成了不朽的功绩。
    中国人民的成就激起新战争挑拨者的忿怒和仇恨。中国人民对侵略力量在东方的新阴谋的回答，是与苏联、民主阵营各国及一切爱好和平的人民更加紧密地加强友谊联系。
    “消息报”最后说：在中华人民共和国建国四周年的日子里，苏联人民热烈祝贺伟大的中国人民在实现国家工业化计划、在发展农业和提高人民福利、在进一步全力巩固自己的人民民主国家的事业中获得新的成就。　（新华社）
