Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: TASS, Vienna, October 9th: The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions held a meeting in Vienna on the 9th. The meeting was attended by: Vittorio, President of the WFTU, Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the WFTU, and the Vice-Presidents of the WFTU: N.M. Shvernik (Soviet Union), Alain Le Léap (France), S.A. Dange (India), B. Brandsson (Netherlands), M. Šupka (Czechoslovakia), Lombardo Toledano (Mexico), Liu Ningyi (China), and members of the WFTU Executive Committee, as well as trade union representatives from Austria, Australia, Hungary, Germany, Iran, Italy, China, Lebanon, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, and France.

    The Executive Committee approved the agenda of the Third World Trade Union Congress, which will open in Vienna on October 10th, and the report on the work of the World Federation of Trade Unions to be submitted to the Congress.

    The WFTU protested to the United Nations and the French government against the French government's refusal to issue passports to the Tunisian and Moroccan delegates attending the Congress, and against the colonial authorities of other African countries for obstructing delegates from attending the Congress in Vienna.

    The Executive Committee unanimously decided to accept the applications of the Independent Workers' Union of Costa Rica and the Workers' Union of Guatemala to join the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    Xinhua News Agency, October 9th: The Third World Trade Union Congress is scheduled to open in Vienna on the 10th. On the eve of the Congress, the working class of various countries has successfully completed the preparatory work for the Congress.

    The WFTU's call in April this year for workers in various countries to actively prepare for the Congress received a warm response from the broad masses of workers around the world. For more than five months, workers in various countries have carried out large-scale preparatory work in various ways.

    In the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries, the working class actively carried out the work of preparing for the Congress. The Soviet Union has sent a delegation headed by Shvernik, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, to attend the Congress, and has used propaganda tools such as newspapers, periodicals, and radio to publicize the significance of convening the Congress to the people of the country. In China, the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, held in May this year, passed a congratulatory telegram to the WFTU, expressing its support for the convening of the Congress and elected a delegation to attend the Congress. Trade union organizations in various parts of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held many rallies to publicize the significance of convening the Congress. Workers in various places sent many gifts made by themselves to the Congress and sent congratulatory messages. In order to welcome the Congress, Vietnamese workers are stepping up their production competition movement, and some workers have increased their production by 100% in a short period of time. In Romania, the Central Council of the Romanian General Confederation of Labor widely distributed leaflets of the WFTU on convening the Third World Trade Union Congress to thousands of young workers from various countries participating in the Fourth World Festival of Youth and Students for Peace and Friendship during the festival, thereby expanding the influence of the Congress. In Poland, workers in various factories wrote letters to their counterparts in capitalist countries, expressing their willingness to defend peace together with them.

    In capitalist countries and colonial countries, the work of workers preparing for the Congress promoted the development of the trade union movement in these countries and greatly strengthened the unity among workers.

    In order to prepare for the Congress, different trade union factions in many countries jointly formed national and regional preparatory committees. Such committees were formed in the United Kingdom, Australia, Finland, Denmark, Iceland, the Gold Coast, Mexico, Brazil, and others. The preparatory committee in Brazil included representatives from twelve trade union organizations. In Japan, India, Ceylon, Cyprus, Indonesia, Finland, Iceland, and Colombia, different trade union organizations also jointly held meetings to prepare for the Congress on the basis of unified action. The French trade union leaders' meeting organized to prepare for the Congress was attended by representatives from 150 trade union organizations.

    Trade union organizations in many countries held many mass rallies to publicize the significance of the Congress and elect delegates to attend the Congress. The Italian General Confederation of Labor and the Dutch General Confederation of Labor organized mass rallies throughout the country. In Finland, nearly 3,000 rallies were held during the preparation for the Congress, with tens of thousands of workers participating. In Algeria, many large and small rallies were held throughout the country to prepare for the Congress. The preparatory committee in Japan held many rallies in Tokyo, Kanagawa, Hokkaido, and other regions, and a delegation of twelve people to attend the Congress has been formed.

    Trade union organizations in various countries have also used various methods to carry out propaganda and explanation among the masses of workers and prepare for the Congress. The All-India Trade Union Congress in India distributed the WFTU's call in nine national languages and held "WFTU Week" from August 3rd to 10th to prepare for the Congress. The preparatory committee in Ceylon published popular WFTU documents in Sinhalese, Tamil, Malay, and English. Local trade union organizations in Iran issued a series of pamphlets during the preparation for the Congress to explain the purpose and tasks of the Congress to Iranian workers. In Latin American countries, trade union organizations combined the increasingly high tide of struggles to increase wages and lower prices with the work of preparing for the Congress. Guatemala and Colombia both launched campaigns to raise travel expenses for delegates attending the Congress, and the Finnish Preparatory Committee also held charity sales to raise travel expenses for delegates attending the Congress.

    In many countries, not only member organizations of the WFTU participated in the preparation for the Congress and the election of delegates to attend the Congress, but also many trade union organizations that did not join the WFTU. In the United Kingdom, many trade union organizations that did not join the WFTU elected observer delegations to attend the Congress. In the Netherlands, many of the representatives elected by dock, construction, and transportation workers in cities such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Utrecht do not belong to the Dutch General Confederation of Labor, which has already joined the WFTU; some trade unions in Lebanon that have not joined the WFTU have also decided to send representatives and observers to attend the Congress; trade unions that have not yet joined the WFTU, such as the Calcutta Dock Workers' Union in India and other trade unions, and the Indonesian General Confederation of Labor in Indonesia, have all sent representatives to attend the Congress; in Latin America, many of the representatives elected by many countries such as Mexico, Uruguay, Chile, and Brazil are not members of trade unions that have joined the WFTU and the Latin American Labor Confederation. For example, in Mexico, among the first batch of representatives elected, there were 18 representatives from trade unions that had not joined the WFTU, which was about the same number as the representatives from trade unions that had joined the WFTU.

    In those countries where reactionary persecution is particularly rampant, trade union organizations insisted on carrying out the preparatory work for the Congress under extremely difficult conditions. The Marine Cooks and Stewards Union of the United States, regardless of the attacks of reactionary newspapers and the persecution of government authorities, vigorously publicized the goals and tasks of the Congress among American workers. Many trade union organizations in the United States wrote letters to the WFTU, stating that American workers would try to send representatives to attend the Congress. In some Latin American countries where trade unions cannot operate openly, trade union organizations also used various methods to carry out propaganda and explanation to the masses in various places. Iranian workers created many ways in the struggle to avoid the persecution of reactionaries and carry out the work of preparing for the Congress. They took advantage of holiday travel opportunities to carry out activities to prepare for the Congress in the countryside with workers in the same industrial sector, and publicized the significance of the Congress to the working peasants. In Lebanon, the police attacked a meeting held by the leadership of the fine carpenters' union to prepare for the Congress, but they still insisted on carrying out the work of preparing for the Congress.

    世界工联向联合国及法国政府提出抗议，抗议法国政府不发护照给参加大会的突尼斯和摩洛哥代表，并抗议非洲其他国家殖民当局阻难参加大会的代表前来维也纳。
    执行委员会一致决议接受哥斯达黎加独立工人联合会和危地马拉工人联合会申请参加世界工联的要求。
    【新华社九日讯】    世界工会第三次代表大会定于十日在维也纳开幕。在大会开幕的前夕，各国工人阶级已胜利完成了大会的筹备工作。
    世界工联在今年四月间发出的号召各国工人积极筹备这次大会的号召书，在全世界广大工人群众中间获得了热烈的响应。五个多月以来，各国工人以各种方式进行了大规模的筹备工作。
    在苏联、中国和各人民民主国家，工人阶级积极进行了筹备大会的工作。苏联已派出了以全苏工会中央理事会主席什维尔尼克为首的代表团出席这次大会，并通过报纸、刊物和无线电等宣传工具，向全国人民深入地宣传了召开这次大会的意义。在中国，今年五月间举行的中国工会第七次全国代表大会通过了向世界工联的致敬电，表示拥护大会的召开，并选出了出席大会的代表团。越南民主共和国的各地工会组织举行了多次集会，宣传召开大会的意义。各地工人把他们亲手做成的许多礼物送给大会，并发去贺电。为了迎接这次大会，越南工人正加紧进行生产竞赛运动，有些工人在短期之内就把生产量提高了百分之一百。在罗马尼亚，罗马尼亚总工会中央理事会在第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节举行期间，曾向参加联欢节的各国几千青年工人广泛散发了世界工联关于召开世界工会第三次代表大会的传单，从而扩大了大会的影响。在波兰，各地工厂的工人纷纷写信给资本主义国家的同业工人，表示愿意和他们一起保卫和平。
    在资本主义国家和殖民地国家，工人筹备大会的工作推动了这些国家工会运动的发展，并大大加强了工人之间的团结。
    为了筹备大会，许多国家的不同工会派别联合组成了全国性和区域性的筹备委员会。组成这种委员会的有英国、澳大利亚、芬兰、丹麦、冰岛、黄金海岸、墨西哥、巴西等。巴西的筹备委员会中包括了十二个工会组织的代表。在日本、印度、锡兰、塞浦路斯、印度尼西亚、芬兰、冰岛、哥伦比亚，不同工会组织也在统一行动的基础上联合举行了筹备大会的会议。为了筹备大会而组织的法国工会领袖会议，有一百五十个工会组织的代表参加。
    许多国家的工会组织举行了很多群众集会来宣传大会的意义并推选出席大会的代表。意大利总工会和荷兰总工会都在全国各地组织了群众集会。在芬兰，筹备大会期间举行了近三千次集会，参加集会的工人有几万人。在阿尔及利亚，全国各地举行了许多次大小集会来筹备这次大会。日本的筹备委员会在东京、神奈川、北海道和其他地区举行了许多次集会，一个包括十二人的出席大会的代表团已经组成了。
    各国工会组织还运用了多种方式在工人群众中进行宣传解释和筹备大会的工作。印度的全印总工会用九种民族语言散发了世界工联的号召书，并在八月三日至十日举行了“世界工联周”来筹备这次大会。锡兰的筹备委员会以锡兰文、泰米尔文、马来亚文和英文出版了通俗的世界工联的文件。伊朗的地方工会组织在筹备大会期间发行了一系列的小册子，向伊朗工人解释大会的目的和任务。在拉丁美洲各国，工会组织结合了日益高涨的争取提高工资和降低物价的斗争，进行了筹备大会的工作。危地马拉和哥伦比亚都展开了为出席大会的代表募集旅费的运动，芬兰筹备委员会也举行义卖，为出席大会的代表募集旅费。
    在许多国家里，参加大会筹备工作和选出代表出席大会的，不仅有世界工联的会员组织，而且还有许多没有参加世界工联的工会组织。在英国，许多没有参加世界工联的工会组织都选出了出席大会的观察员代表团。在荷兰，阿姆斯特丹、鹿特丹、乌得勒支等城市的码头、建筑和运输工人已选出的代表中，有很多人不属于已经参加世界工联的荷兰总工会；黎巴嫩的一些没有加入世界工联的工会，也决定派遣代表和观察员出席大会；还没有加入世界工联的工会如印度的加尔各答码头工人工会及其他工会和印尼的印尼总工会，都已经派代表出席大会；在拉丁美洲，墨西哥、乌拉圭、智利、巴西等许多国家选出的代表中，有很多人不是参加世界工联和拉丁美洲劳工联盟的工会的会员，例如在墨西哥，单是第一批选出的代表中，没有加入世界工联的工会的代表就有十八人，和已加入世界工联的工会的代表数目差不多。
    在那些反动迫害特别猖狂的国度里，工会组织在极困难的条件下，坚持进行了大会的筹备工作。美国海船厨师侍者工会不顾反动报纸的攻击和政府当局的迫害，在美国工人中间大力宣传了大会的目标和任务，美国许多工会组织写信给世界工联，表示美国工人将设法派代表出席大会。在拉丁美洲一些工会不能公开活动的地方，工会组织也使用了各种方法向各地群众进行宣传解释。伊朗工人在斗争中创造了许多办法来避开反动派的迫害，进行筹备大会的工作。他们利用假日旅行的机会，和同一产业部门的工人在乡村中进行筹备大会的活动，并对劳动农民宣传大会的意义。在黎巴嫩，警察袭击了细木匠工会领导机构为筹备大会而举行的集会，但他们仍坚持进行了筹备大会的工作。
