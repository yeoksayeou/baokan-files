Disregarding Workers' Health, Neglecting Product Quality
Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory Completes Production Plan Through Crash Methods
    The leading cadres of Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory pursued the completion of the plan through crash methods, disregarding the health of the workers and neglecting the quality of the products.
    The factory finally "overfulfilled" the third quarter production plan at the end of September. Deputy Director He Zongyi believed that September had "significant progress" compared to August, and Ma Zhenhai, deputy director of the assembly workshop, was even more satisfied that September had "overfulfilled" the task.
    How did the No. 2 Machine Tool Factory complete the task? The factory has consistently been lax at first and then tight in production. By the sixteenth of September, it had not produced a single machine. The situation was very urgent, so the leading cadres used the "labor exchange" method to crash the work. The method was to ask the workers to work a lot of overtime at the end of the month, and then ask them to rest according to the overtime hours when there was no work to do at the beginning of the next month. The workers called this rest period "extended holiday", and some people took advantage of the "holiday" to return to their hometowns. Electrician Wang Jinhui went to work from 6:30 am on September 27th until 5:00 pm the next day. Except for the time to eat, he had no free time. Fitter Pan Xueyuan and Li Enshang only slept for two or three hours in two days and two nights. Among the thirty-six workers in the painting group, twenty-five worked overtime, working an extra four hundred and sixty-four hours in just ten days. At the most intense time, the workers' eyes were bloodshot, and they ran back from the toilet with their pants on. Young worker Min Zhenhe worked twelve hours a day for two or three consecutive days. He became dizzy in the afternoon. As a result, on the afternoon of the 27th, he accidentally crushed two of his fingers.
    Because of the rush for quantity, few people paid attention to quality. During packaging on the evening of September 30th, three unqualified radial drilling machines numbered sixteen, seventeen, and twenty were packaged as qualified products. When these three machines were being packaged, the inspector had already discovered that the horizontal arm's "clamping pressure" was not working well, and the horizontal arm was moving. (The last two radial drilling machines sold to the Shenyang Water Pump Factory, one of which could not be installed on time because the "clamping pressure" was loose. When the test run was carried out, the parts were damaged as soon as they rotated. The other one has not been used until now because the screw rod is bent, which has affected the production of the Water Pump Factory.) However, Ma Hanqing, another deputy director of the assembly workshop, brushed it off by saying that "the workshop will be responsible for any accidents that occur afterwards." Similar sloppy phenomena also occurred in the painting group and the general assembly group. For example, in order to rush to put them in boxes, putty was painted before it was dry, and paint was packaged before it was dry. Some machines began to lose paint in pieces before they left the factory. The appearance was rough, parts that should not be filed were filed, and parts that should not be scraped were scraped. There were also many parts that were drilled or broken.
    This is how the No. 2 Machine Tool Factory "overfulfilled" the third quarter plan and the production increase and conservation plan.

### 漠视工人身体健康，忽视产品质量  沈阳第二机床厂以突击方法完成生产计划

    漠视工人身体健康，忽视产品质量
    沈阳第二机床厂以突击方法完成生产计划
    沈阳第二机床厂领导干部用突击方法追求完成计划，漠视工人的身体健康，忽视了产品的质量。
    该厂在九月底终于“超额完成”了第三季度生产计划。副厂长何宗伊认为九月份较八月份有“显著进步”，装配车间副主任马振海更满足于九月份“超额完成”了任务。
    第二机床厂是怎样完成任务的呢？该厂在生产上一贯先松后紧，九月份到了十六日还没生产出一台机器，情况很急，领导干部便以“换工”方法来突击。其做法是：月末叫工人大量加班加点，到下月初没活干的时候再按加班加点的工时叫工人歇工。工人们把这种歇工叫做“放大假”，有人便趁
    “假期”回了家乡。电工王金会从九月二十七日晨六点半上班，到第二天下午五时才下班，中间除了吃饭的时候没法干活以外，其余时间全没闲着。钳工潘学元、李恩赏两天两夜只睡了两三个钟头。油漆组三十六个工人中，有二十五个工人加班加点，仅十天内就多干了四百六十四个工时。在最紧张的时候，工人眼珠子熬得通红，上厕所去一次都是提着裤子往回跑。青工闵振和一连两三天，天天工作十二个小时，到了下午便昏沉沉的，结果在二十七日下午，一不小心，把手指头压掉了两个。
    因为赶数量，就很少有人重视质量。在九月三十日晚间包装时，把十六、十七、二十号三台不合格的摇臂钻床当合格品包装起来。当包装这三台机器时，检查员已发现横臂“夹压”不好使，横臂活动，（上次卖给沈阳水泵厂的两台摇臂钻床，其中一台就是因为“夹压”松，不能按时安装，试车时刚一转动，部件就碰坏了。另一台因丝杠弯，到现在也没使用，影响了水泵厂的生产。）但是装配车间另一副主任马汉卿却以“事后发生任何事故由本车间负责”而搪塞了过去。在油漆组和总装组也发生类似马虎的现象，如为了急于打上箱，腻子不干就喷漆，油漆不干就包装，有的机器没等出厂就一片一片往下掉漆，外表粗糙，不该锉的部件也给锉了，不该刮的也给刮了，钻坏、打坏的部件也不少。
    第二机床厂就是这样“超额完成”了第三季度计划和增产节约计划。
