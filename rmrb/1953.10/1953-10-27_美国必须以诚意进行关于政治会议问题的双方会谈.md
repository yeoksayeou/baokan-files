    The bilateral talks on the political conference issue began in Panmunjom on October 26. The vast global public is closely watching the progress of these talks and hopes that they will facilitate the smooth convening of the political conference.

    After consulting with the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Central People's Government of our country authorized Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on October 10 and October 19 to issue reply statements and notifications regarding the notifications forwarded by the Swedish Embassy on behalf of the U.S. government. These statements and notifications justly pointed out that the United Nations General Assembly's eighth session's refusal to include on its agenda the four proposals from the Chinese and Korean governments regarding the General Assembly taking steps as quickly as possible to expand the membership of the political conference to enable its swift convening was an unreasonable manifestation of the United Nations General Assembly violating the principle of peaceful consultation to resolve international disputes. However, in order to promote the swift convening of the political conference, the Chinese and Korean governments agreed to have representatives appointed by the Korean and Chinese governments hold bilateral talks with U.S. representatives in Panmunjom regarding the political conference issue. This meeting should not only resolve the location and time of the political conference but, more importantly, should resolve the issue of the membership of the political conference.

    People have once again seen the unwavering peaceful sincerity of the Chinese and Korean governments. It was only due to this significant peaceful effort by the Chinese and Korean governments that the first serious obstacle set by the United States, which controls the United Nations, in the path of convening the political conference was broken, making bilateral talks on the political conference issue possible.

    At the first meeting of the bilateral talks on the political conference issue held on the 26th, our representative, Qi Shifu, pointed out in his speech: "The dispatch of representatives by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the government of the People's Republic of China to conduct bilateral talks with U.S. representatives regarding the political conference is yet another effort by the Chinese and Korean governments to ensure that the political conference can be convened quickly and smoothly. This meeting is being conducted on the basis of equal treatment between the relevant governments of the belligerent parties in Korea. We believe that all issues should be resolved through consultation in this meeting; all issues that must be discussed and resolved in order to smoothly convene the political conference should be discussed and resolved in this meeting, and nothing should be excluded." At the same time, representative Huang Hua pointed out in his speech: "The resolution of the issue of the membership of the political conference must be regarded as the main task of this bilateral meeting."

    However, previous facts have shown that, because the suggestions of China and Korea that relevant neutral countries such as the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma should participate in the political conference in addition to the belligerent parties in Korea have gained widespread international sympathy and support, the United States did not hesitate to use deceptive means to prevent the Eighth UN General Assembly from discussing the issue of expanding the membership of the political conference. Even now, the United States has not abandoned its stubborn stance on the issue of the membership of the political conference. Despite the fact that the U.S. government clearly stated in its notification to the Chinese and Korean governments, forwarded on October 14, that it was prepared to send its representatives to "exchange views" with representatives from the Chinese and Korean sides on the issue of the membership of the political conference, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles insisted on October 20 that the issue of membership, which is crucial to the success or failure of the political conference, had been "resolved" by a resolution of the United Nations General Assembly. Dean, the U.S. representative participating in the bilateral talks on the political conference issue, even publicly contradicted the U.S. government's notification of October 14 on the eve of attending the meeting, saying that he was not authorized to discuss the issue of membership. At the same time, the Lee Seung-man clique once again expressed its intention to threaten and disrupt the political conference, claiming that "if neutral countries are allowed to participate in the conference, then the South Korean government may refuse to participate -- in other words, boycott -- the conference." As a result, U.S. news agencies seized the opportunity to release negative air about the political conference, saying that if the Lee Seung-man clique was unwilling to "compromise," Dean would be "helpless." While sending representatives to participate in the bilateral talks on the political conference issue, the United States simultaneously laid obstacles in advance to the smooth progress of the talks. This shows that the U.S. government is unwilling to resolve issues in the bilateral talks through peaceful consultation with sincerity, but hopes to unilaterally impose conditions in a domineering manner, demanding that its counterpart accept them completely. This is certainly of no help to the bilateral talks.

    Based on our consistent policy of peacefully resolving the Korean issue to consolidate peace in Asia and the world, the Chinese and Korean governments agreed to hold talks with U.S. representatives in order to strive for a reasonable solution to this issue. Our sincere, open, and aboveboard attitude and position are completely different from the attitude and position of the U.S. government. In my reply statement to the U.S. government on October 10, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out: "The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has always believed that the political conference should not be a repetition of the Panmunjom negotiation format, but should have the participation of other relevant neutral countries besides the belligerent parties in Korea, in order to facilitate the smooth progress of the conference and thereby seek solutions to issues such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue." In his reply notification to the U.S. government on October 19, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai clearly pointed out: "The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that this meeting can include the resolution of the issues of the location and time of the political conference raised in the U.S. government's notification, as well as various issues related to procedures, administrative management, and arrangements; but the Central People's Government still believes that the more important thing in this meeting is to resolve the issue of the membership of the political conference."

    Therefore, this meeting between representatives of the Chinese and Korean governments and representatives of the U.S. government must not, as suggested by the U.S. government, only discuss and resolve the issues of the location and time of the political conference; more importantly, it should discuss and resolve the issue of the membership of the political conference, in order to ensure that the political conference can be convened with the participation of neutral countries, so that it can proceed smoothly and complete its tasks.

    After receiving my Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's reply notification of October 19, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles issued a statement on October 20, saying: "We certainly hope that after this meeting, an actual political conference can be held." Now, if the U.S. government wants to make Dulles' beautiful words stand the new test under the world's attention, then it should show sincerity in the current meeting, abandon its domineering attitude, and adopt an attitude of resolving issues in a spirit of consultation, to discuss and resolve the issue of the membership of the political conference, in order to facilitate the rapid convening of the political conference that the world is eagerly awaiting.

### 美国必须以诚意进行关于政治会议问题的双方会谈

    美国必须以诚意进行关于政治会议问题的双方会谈
    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈，已于十月廿六日在板门店开始举行。世界广大公众都在密切注视着这次会谈的进行，并期望它有利于政治会议的顺利召开。
    我国中央人民政府经与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府协商后，于十月十日和十月十九日授权周恩来外交部长就瑞典大使馆先后代替美国政府转来的通知，提出了答复声明和通知，正当地指出了联合国第八届大会拒绝将中朝两国政府关于大会应尽速采取步骤来扩大政治会议成员、使这个会议得以迅速召开的四项建议列入议程的行为，是联合国大会违背和平协商解决国际争端的原则的无理表现；但中朝两国政府为了推动政治会议的迅速召开，同意由朝、中两国政府指派代表与美国代表在板门店进行关于政治会议问题的双方会谈；这一会谈不仅应当解决政治会议的地点和时间问题，而且更主要的是应当解决政治会议的成员问题。
    人们又一次看到了中朝两国政府不可移易的和平诚意。只是由于中朝两国政府这一重大的和平努力，才打破了美国把持联合国在召开政治会议的道路上所设置的第一道严重障碍，使关于政治会议问题的双方会谈成为可能。
    在二十六日举行的双方关于政治会议问题会谈的第一次会议上，我方奇石福代表在发言中指出：“此次朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府派遣我们来与美国代表进行关于政治会议的双方会谈，正是朝中两国政府为了保证政治会议能够迅速和顺利地召开的又一次努力。这一个会谈是朝鲜交战双方有关政府在平等对待的基础上进行的。我们认为：在这个会谈中，一切问题都应经过协商求得解决；一切为了顺利召开政治会议所必须讨论和解决的问题，都应在此次会谈中加以讨论和解决，而不应该有所排除。”同时，黄华代表在发言中又指出：“政治会议成员问题的解决，必须被认为是这次双方会谈中主要的任务。”
    但是，前此的事实表明，由于中、朝两国关于政治会议应有除朝鲜交战双方以外的苏联、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和缅甸等有关中立国家参加的建议获得了广泛的国际同情与支持，美国曾不惜使用欺诈手段，来阻止八届联大讨论扩大政治会议的成员问题。直到现在，美国仍然没有放弃它对于政治会议成员问题所采取的顽固立场。尽管美国政府在其十月十四日转来致朝中两国政府的通知中明明说准备派他们的代表就政治会议成员问题和朝中方面的代表“交换意见”，美国国务卿杜勒斯却在十月二十日硬说，政治会议成败所系的成员问题已由联合国大会的决议“解决”了。美方参加关于政治会议问题的双方会谈的代表迪安，在出席会议的前夕甚至公然和美国政府十月十四日的通知相反，说他并未受权讨论成员问题。同时，李承晚集团再次表示要对政治会议进行威胁和捣乱，声称“如果让中立国参加会议，那末韩国政府就可能拒绝参加——换句话说，抵制——会议。”于是美国通讯社乘机对政治会议放出消极的空气说，如果李承晚集团不肯
    “妥协”，迪安就将“束手无策”。美国一边派出代表参加了关于政治会议问题的双方会谈，一边却在事先就对会谈的顺利进行布置了障碍。这说明美国政府不愿以诚意经过和平协商来在双方会谈中解决问题，而希望一味以唯我独尊的专断态度提出条件，要求它的对方完全接受。这对于双方会谈当然是毫无帮助的。
    中、朝两国政府本着我方一贯坚持和平解决朝鲜问题以利巩固亚洲及世界和平的政策，同意与美方代表进行会谈，以争取对这一问题的合理解决。我方这种诚意的光明磊落的态度和立场，是和美国政府的态度和立场截然不同的。我周恩来外长在十月十日对美国政府的答复声明中指出：“中华人民共和国中央人民政府始终认为，政治会议不应该是板门店谈判形式的重复，而应该有除朝鲜交战双方之外的其他有关中立国家参加，以利会议的顺利进行，从而谋求撤退一切外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题等问题的解决。”周恩来外长在十月十九日对美国政府的答复通知中又明白地指出：“中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为，在这一会谈中，可以包括美国政府通知中所提出的解决政治会议的地点和时间问题，以及有关程序的、行政管理的和安排方面的各项问题；但中央人民政府仍然认为，在这一会谈中更主要的还是应当解决政治会议的成员问题。”
    因此，朝中两国政府代表和美国政府代表举行的这一会谈，决不能像美国政府的建议那样，仅讨论和解决政治会议的地点和时间问题，它更主要的是应当讨论和解决政治会议的成员问题，以保证政治会议能在有中立国参加之下召开，使它能够顺利进行并完成其任务。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在收到我国周恩来外长十月十九日的答复通知后，于十月二十日发表声明说：“我们当然希望，在这次会谈之后，将能举行实际的政治会议。”现在美国政府如果要使杜勒斯的漂亮言词受得起举世注目下的新的考验，那末，它就应当在现在举行的会谈中表现出诚意，放弃它那种独断专行的态度，而采取用协商精神解决问题的态度，来讨论并解决政治会议的成员问题，以利于举世渴望的政治会议的迅速召开。
