Title: Chairman Thimayya of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission Sends Letter to Hamblen Demanding the U.S. Side to Expedite Construction of Explanation Enclosures and Cease Delaying, and Rejecting the U.S. Request to Send Personnel to "Observe" "All Activities" of POW Camps

(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th) General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, has notified the American Hamblen, demanding that the U.S. side cease further delays and promptly complete the construction of new explanation facilities in the southern POW camps. Hamblen is the head of the repatriation group of the United Nations Command, and all activities of this repatriation group are aimed at delaying and obstructing the explanation work.

General Thimayya today released the letter he wrote to Hamblen on October 5th. In the letter, he stated that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have indicated that they will complete the construction of explanation facilities within a few days
(Editor's note: All permanent explanation sites constructed by the Korean and Chinese side for use by the U.S. side were completed on the 4th and handed over to the Indian Custodial Forces on the morning of the 5th), while the U.S. side said that they "might" need several weeks to construct explanation facilities.

General Thimayya said: "The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has decided that the United Nations Command should be required to construct explanation facilities as a matter of utmost urgency." He said: "The Commission is confident that you will be able to complete the construction of explanation facilities in a much shorter time than you anticipate."

General Thimayya added: "I reiterate the suggestion I made to you in my letter of October 2nd: I am prepared to provide you with manpower to assist you in completing the construction work in the shortest possible time. ...I can also tell you here that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Headquarters have clearly stated that they are prepared to complete permanent buildings in four days and temporary buildings in two days."

General Thimayya concluded: "I would be grateful if you would regard this letter as a firm demand from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for the construction of new explanation facilities at the designated locations. I reiterate my sincere hope that the United Nations Command, with all its strength, will be able to complete the necessary construction work in the shortest possible time. I would very much like to know the date by which you will be able to complete the temporary and permanent buildings, and I would be very grateful if you could inform me of this date before 22:00 on October 6, 1953."

In another letter, General Thimayya rejected Hamblen's request to allow United Nations Command observers to "observe" the "entire activities" of the POW camps, "observing matters related to prisoners of war such as diet, clothing, entertainment, medical care, religious activities, and disciplinary control."

General Thimayya said: "The request you have made could only be granted if the United Nations Command could be considered the protector of the prisoners of war. However, I am sure you will agree that the United Nations Command cannot possibly be considered the protector of the prisoners of war belonging to the other side—namely, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Headquarters."

General Thimayya added: "The Commission is very happy to provide the observers of your Command and the Headquarters of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers with all the facilities you desire. That might prevent the absurd and malicious rumors currently published in some newspapers. However, the Commission can only do what it is authorized to do. It is not authorized to designate the United Nations Command as the protector of the prisoners of war belonging to the Headquarters of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers."

It is remembered that it was Hamblen who refused to allow observers to be present when the United Nations Command handed over the captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese side to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Now Hamblen is asking to "observe" the "entire activities" of the POW camps. This is clearly to maintain the U.S. side's threatening influence over the prisoners of war and to facilitate its agents within the POW camps to sabotage the explanation work.

### 中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅致函汉布伦  要求美方迅速修建解释营场不要继续拖延  并拒绝美方派员“观察”战俘营“全部活动”的要求

    中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅致函汉布伦
    要求美方迅速修建解释营场不要继续拖延
    并拒绝美方派员“观察”战俘营“全部活动”的要求
    【新华社开城六日电】中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军已通知美国的汉布伦，要求美方不再继续拖延，迅速完成在南部战俘营中修建新的解释设备的工作。汉布伦是联合国军司令部遣返组组长，这个遣返组的一切活动，都是为了要拖延和阻挠解释工作。
    蒂迈雅将军在今天发表了他于十月五日写给汉布伦的信。他在信中说：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军已表示将在数天内完成修建解释设备的工作
  （编者按：朝中方面修建的供美方使用的全部永久性解释场所，已于四日完工，并于五日上午移交给印度看管部队），而美方曾说，他们“可能”需要数星期的时间来修建解释设备。
    蒂迈雅将军说：“中立国遣返委员会决定：应要求联合国军司令部作为一件最紧急的事情来修建解释设备。”他说：“本委员会满怀信心地希望你能够在比你预计的时间短得多的时间内完成解释设备的修建。”
    蒂迈雅将军又说：“我再度向你提出我于十月二日的信中向你提出的建议：我准备供给你人力，以便协助你在尽可能短的时间内，完成修建工作。……我也可以在这里告诉你：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部已明确地表示，他们准备在四天内完成永久性的建筑物，并且可以在两天内完成临时性的建筑物。”
    蒂迈雅将军最后说：“如果蒙你把这封信看作是中立国遣返委员会坚决要求在指定的地点修建新的解释设备，我将十分感激。我再度向你表明，我诚恳地希望，联合国军司令部以它所有的力量，将可以在最短的时间内完成必要的修建工作。我非常希望知道你能够完成临时性的与永久性的建筑物的日期，而且如果你能够在一九五三年十月六日二十二时以前把这个日期告诉我的话，我将十分感谢你。”
    蒂迈雅将军在另一封信里拒绝了汉布伦提出的要求，汉布伦要求准许联合国军观察人员“观察”战俘营的“全部活动，观察诸如饮食、衣着、娱乐活动、医疗照顾、宗教活动、纪律管制等有关战俘的事项。”
    蒂迈雅将军说：“你所提出的要求，只有在可以认为联合国军司令部是战俘的保护者的情况下，才能予以应允。但是，我知道你一定会同意，联合国军司令部将不可能被认为是属于他方——即朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军司令部——的战俘们的保护者的。”
    蒂迈雅将军又说：“本委员会是非常乐于使你的司令部和朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军司令部的观察人员获得你所希望的一切便利。那样也许会防止目前在某些报纸上所刊载的荒谬而含有恶意的谣言。但是，本委员会只能作它受权作的事情。它并未受权指定联合国军司令部作为属于朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部的战俘们的保护者。”
    人们记得，正是汉布伦曾拒绝允许观察人员在联合国军司令部向中立国遣返委员会移交朝中被俘人员时到场参观，现在汉布伦又要求“观察”战俘营的“全部活动”，这显然是为了要保持美方对战俘的威胁影响，并便于指使它在战俘营内的特务破坏解释工作。
