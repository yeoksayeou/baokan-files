Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th -- The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission announced today that it has decided to dispatch Indian missionaries to POW camps to serve the POWs. This thwarts the US attempt to send American special agents disguised as missionaries and priests into the POW camps. The US had requested to send four so-called "missionaries" and "priests" who were special agents in disguise to travel between the POW camps and the Indian detention camps to US military headquarters in order to carry out liaison tasks. In order to achieve this request, the US instigated its special agents to create demonstrations in the POW camps, and mobilized the American news agencies to vigorously promote the POWs' so-called religious beliefs. United Press International was instructed on the 11th to issue a message supporting the US request to send "missionaries" to visit the captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese side. The message stated that nearly 22,000 POWs converted to Christianity during the period from September 1950 to last month when they were handed over to the Indian army. However, the UPI dared not report how they "converted" to Christianity, nor did it dare to report what the "missionaries" the US was requesting to send were actually doing.

　　Chinese People's Volunteer Army returnees Zhang Jiliang and Ma Youqing provided a full answer to this question. When they were in the US POW camps, they were specifically assigned to help the American chaplain Wu Boli, who spoke Chinese, and the South Korean "missionary" Han Binghe to register church members. They said that in September 1951, "missionary" Han Binghe gathered a large team of captured personnel from the 72nd POW camp on Geoje Island and asked: "Who among you believes in Christianity? Raise your hand!" At that time, only a few people raised their hands with a look of fear, so the special agents on the side jumped up and scolded the captured personnel for "not knowing what's good for them" and ordered: "Raise them all for me!" Zhang Jiliang said: "The 'church members' that the missionaries asked me to write on the roster were created in this way!"

　　Zhang Jiliang and Ma Youqing said: Every time the POWs went to listen to "sermons" or "worship," they were driven there by special agents with sticks. Anyone who didn't go would be beaten. They also said: Wu Boli often told the POWs during "sermons" or "worship": "I was very familiar with Chiang Kai-shek when I was on the mainland, and I participated in his baptism." "I talked to Wang Dongyuan about the situation in the POW camps, and he hopes you will go to Taiwan as soon as possible!" "May God bless you to go to Taiwan!" and other shameless words. If anyone showed impatience, the "missionary" would threaten him and say, "Are you a Communist?"

　　Zhang Jiliang said: "The more we went on, the clearer we saw that these 'missionaries' were actually American special agents." Wu Boli and others had instructed special agents to investigate "red elements" and compile blacklists. In September 1951, Wu Boli and Han Binghe, along with special agents Wang Shunqing, Li Daan, and an American captain, arrested Zhang Jiming, a volunteer army prisoner who had been sick for two months, and took him to the military police headquarters to torture him and give him electric shocks, forcing him to admit that he was an "officer." Before the illegal bloody "screening" in 1952, Wu Boli had sent hundreds of six-inch-long knives engraved with the letters "US" to the special agents in the POW camp. When the special agents were beating and killing people, Wu Boli often said from the side: "Kill them, God will punish you!" "Go to hell, you people who believe in communism!"

　　Among the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, the situation was similar to the above. Wu Changshan, a People's Army prisoner who was recently repatriated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, said that two American "missionaries" with Korean names of Ok Ho-yeol and Kim A-yeol frequently operated in the Nonsan POW camp. When the two sides exchanged sick and wounded prisoners in April this year, he heard through a partition wall the American "missionary" say to Kim Nak-seon, a special agent leader in the Nonsan POW camp: "If all the prisoners of war are to be exchanged in the future, you should take the people and escape!" Sure enough, when Lee Seung-man "released" the prisoners of war, this Kim Nak-seon was ordered to coerce a portion of the prisoners of war to "collectively escape."

　　Many of our captured personnel who had escaped the control of special agents and been repatriated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission said that those so-called "missionaries," "priests," and even "masters" who were engaged in special agent activities under the guise of religion in the US POW camps were already near the demilitarized zone, ready to enter the Indian camp at any time. Wang Xu, a volunteer army returnee who had worked as a translator in the 4th Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the 3rd POW Camp on Jeju Island, said that when they left Jeju Island for the demilitarized zone, Wu Boli said to the POWs: "You go first, I will come later, and we will meet in the demilitarized zone." This proves that the US had long premeditated to send special agent "missionaries" into the Indian camp to tighten control over the POWs and sabotage the explanation work.

### 美方派特务“牧师”混入战俘营的阴谋失败

    美方派特务“牧师”混入战俘营的阴谋失败
    【新华社开城十二日电】中立国遣返委员会今天宣布，委员会决定从印度派遣牧师到战俘营里来为战俘服务，这就使美方要求派遣伪装为牧师、神甫的美方特务到战俘营里来的计划遭到了失败。美方曾经要求派遣四名由特务改装的所谓“牧师”、
    “神甫”来往于各战俘营场之间以及印度拘留营地与美军司令部之间，以便执行联络的任务。为了达到这个要求，美方发动它的特务在战俘营中制造示威，并发动美国的通讯社大肆宣传战俘的所谓宗教信仰。合众社在十一日被授意发出一条消息，支持美方的派“牧师”访问朝中被俘人员的要求。这条消息说有将近两万两千名战俘在从一九五○年九月到上月被移交给印度军队期间信奉了基督教。可是合众社却不敢报道他们是怎样“信奉”基督教的，更不敢报道美方要求派的“牧师”究竟是干什么的。
    这个问题，中国人民志愿军归来人员张继良和马幼卿给予了充分的解答。他们在美方战俘营时，曾被指定专门帮助会说中国话的美国随军“牧师”吴博礼和南朝鲜“牧师”韩秉赫做登记教徒的工作。他们说，一九五一年九月，韩秉赫“牧师”曾把巨济岛第七十二战俘营一个大队的被俘人员集合起来问：“你们谁信基督教？举手！”当时，只有稀稀拉拉几个人怀着惶恐的神色举起手来，于是在一旁的特务分子就暴跳起来痛骂被俘人员“不识抬举”，并命令说：“统统给我举起来！”张继良说：“牧师们叫我记到名册上去的‘教徒’就是这样弄出来的！”
    张继良和马幼卿说：每次战俘去听“讲道”或“做礼拜”，都是被特务用棍棒赶着去的，谁要不去，就要挨到毒打。他们又说：吴博礼在“讲道”或“做礼拜”的时候，常常告诉战俘：“我在大陆时和蒋介石很熟，我参加过他的洗礼。”“我和王东原谈过战俘营的情形，他希望你们赶快到台湾去！”“愿上帝保佑你们到台湾去吧！”等等无耻的话。如果有人表示不耐烦，“牧师”就恫吓他说：“你是共产党吧！”
    张继良说：“愈到后来，我们愈清楚地看出这些‘牧师’其实是美国人的特务。”吴博礼等曾指使特务分子调查“赤色分子”，编造黑名单。一九五一年九月，吴博礼、韩秉赫带着特务王顺清、李大安及一个美军上尉，把一个生了两个月病的志愿军被俘人员张纪明抓到宪兵司令部去拷打、上电刑，逼他承认是“军官”。在一九五二年非法的血腥
    “甄别”以前，吴博礼曾给战俘营内的特务分子送进去几百把刻着US字样的六寸长的刀子。特务分子打人杀人的时候，吴博礼也常常在旁边说：“杀吧，上帝处罚你们！”“下地狱吧，你们这些信仰共产主义的人！”
    在朝鲜人民军被俘人员中间，情形也和上述的差不多。最近由中立国遣返委员会遣返归来的人民军被俘人员武昌善说，有两个朝鲜文名字叫玉镐烈和金阿烈的美籍“牧师”经常在论山战俘营活动。今年四月双方交换伤病战俘时，他曾隔着一层板壁听见美国“牧师”对论山战俘营的一个特务头目金洛善说：“如果将来全部战俘都要交换，你们就带着人逃跑！”果然，李承晚“释放”战俘时，这个金洛善就奉命胁持一部分战俘“集体逃亡”了。
    许多已经逃脱特务控制由中立国遣返委员会遣返回来的我方被俘人员都说，那些原在美方战俘营披着宗教外衣进行特务活动的所谓“牧师”、“神甫”以至“法师”，已经到了非军事区附近，随时都准备进入印度营地。曾在济州岛第三战俘营第三联队第四大队当过翻译的志愿军归来人员王旭说，在他们离开济州岛到非军事区时，吴博礼曾对战俘说：“你们先走，我随后就来，在非军事区见面。”这证明美方早已预谋派遣特务“牧师”进入印度营地来加紧控制战俘和破坏解释工作。
