　　Xinhua News Agency, October 15th: The eighteenth issue of the Soviet "News" magazine published an article by economist Pevzner entitled "The Arms Race Undermines the American Economy," discussing the development of the American economic crisis. The article states: More and more signs of economic crisis are appearing in the United States, which has recently become a topic that American newspapers like to talk about. Most authors who comment on this issue reflect the extreme anxiety of the financial and business circles.

　　The author refutes the claim that the arms race is always a reliable pillar of corporate activity. He points out: While economic militarization does "make money" for large corporations, it also reduces the demand of consumers for civilian goods. For example, from 1946 to 1952, food consumption decreased by 6 percent per capita. The consequences soon became apparent: the production index of non-durable goods (1935-39 being 100) fell from 194 in 1951 to 189 in 1952, and the production of consumer durable goods fell by 37 percent between 1950 and 1952.

　　The author points out: Moreover, this process has not stopped there. In some economic sectors, especially agriculture, overproduction has become a common problem. The unsold wheat stocks in the next agricultural year will reach an unprecedented record of one billion bushels. This is happening at a time when American grain consumption has already decreased. Agricultural prices have fallen by 17 percent from the 1951 level, which is a definite sign that agriculture is beginning to overproduce.

　　Overproduction has spread from agriculture to other civilian industries. In 1952-53, the sectors with declining production included agricultural machinery, refrigerator manufacturing, radio and television manufacturing, household electrical appliance manufacturing, food processing, tobacco industry, leather industry, hosiery manufacturing, and some sectors of the textile industry. Automobile production has also recently decreased significantly.

　　The author continues: Many facts show that the economic prospects of the United States today are even gloomier than when production began to decline after the end of the war. Industry and commerce are currently accumulating staggering inventories. The increasingly large inventories are a sign of overproduction that has been hidden and is now revealed. Another development in the same direction is the huge consumer debt. The increasing consumer debt is a sign of the decrease in the actual income of the majority of the people. Like excessive inventories, it is a sign of hidden overproduction and a factor in the formation of obvious overproduction.

　　The author concludes: In our era, one of the decisive factors in the world economic situation is that the countries of the democratic camp, which account for about one-third of the world's population, are not affected by the crisis. Their economies are developing rapidly and uninterruptedly under any circumstances. This means that the capacity of their markets is constantly expanding, which provides great opportunities for mutually beneficial trade with Western countries. That is why many Western entrepreneurs are advocating broader trade with the East, and that is why more and more people around the world are demanding an end to the Cold War and a peaceful settlement of all disputes.

　　Correction: In the article "New Military Adventures of US and France in Aggression Against Vietnam" on page 4 of the October 18th issue, the first line of the seventh paragraph, "5,000 paratroopers" should read "two battalions of paratroopers."

    苏联“新闻”杂志论述美国经济危机的发展
    【新华社十五日讯】第十八期苏联“新闻”杂志刊载了经济学家佩夫兹涅尔的题为“军备竞赛破坏了美国的经济”一文，论述美国经济危机的发展。文章说：美国经济出现愈来愈多的危机迹象，这在最近已成为美国报刊喜欢谈论的题目了。大多数就这个问题发表议论的作者，反映了金融界与企业界的极度不安。
    文章作者驳斥了所谓军备永远是企业活动的一个可靠的支柱的说法。他指出：经济军事化的确为大公司“制造了金钱”，但它也同时使民用品消费者的需求下降。例如，从一九四六年到一九五二年，食品消费量以每人为单位计算减少了百分之六。因而引起的结果不久就显露出来了：非耐用品的生产指数（一九三五—三九年为一百）从一九五一年的一九四减至一九五二年的一八九，消费耐用品的生产量在一九五○年到一九五二年之间下降了百分之三十七。
    作者指出：而且这个过程并没有到此为止。在一些经济部门，特别是农业，生产过剩已经成为普遍的问题。在下一农业年度卖不出去的小麦存货达到十亿蒲式耳的空前纪录。这种情况正发生在美国粮食消费已经减少的时候。农产品价格已经从一九五一年的水平下跌了百分之十七，这是农业开始生产过剩的肯定迹象。
    生产过剩已从农业扩展到了其他一些民用工业。在一九五二—五三年，生产下降的部门有农业机器业、冰箱制造业、无线电与电视制造业、家庭电气用品制造业、食品加工业、烟草业、皮革业、鞋袜制造业及纺织工业的一些部门。汽车生产最近也大量减少。
    作者继续写道：许多事实说明：美国今日的经济前景比起大战结束生产开始走下坡路时还要黯淡。工业与商业目前堆积了大得惊人的存货。日益庞大的存货是一向隐蔽着的而现在已经显现的生产过剩的一个迹象。另一个在同一方向发展的是庞大的消费者债务。不断增加的消费者债务，是说明大多数人民实际收入减少的征象。正如过多的存货一样，它是隐蔽的生产过剩的迹象和形成明显的生产过剩的因素。
    作者最后写道：在我们的时代里，世界经济形势中的决定性因素之一，是约占世界人口三分之一的民主阵营的国家不会受到危机的影响。它们的经济在任何情况下都在迅速地、无间断地发展着。这意味着，它们的市场的容纳量在不断扩大，这提供了与西方国家进行互惠贸易的巨大机会。这就是为什么许多西方的企业家正在主张与东方进行更广泛的贸易的原因，这就是为什么世界各地要求结束冷战并和平解决一切争执问题的人越来越多的原因。
