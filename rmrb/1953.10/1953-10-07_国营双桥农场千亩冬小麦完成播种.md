State-Run Shuangqiao Farm Completes Sowing of Thousands of Mu of Winter Wheat

    The state-run Shuangqiao Farm victoriously completed the sowing task of one thousand mu of winter wheat before the National Day. Before sowing, all the staff and workers of the farm enthusiastically responded to the call for increasing production and practicing economy, summarized the experience of this year's wheat bumper harvest, and further implemented the advanced experience of the Soviet Union during sowing, improving work methods and winter wheat sowing technology.

    Shuangqiao Farm used excellent varieties in sowing to ensure the quality of the seeds. There was much rain this summer and autumn, and the seeds themselves had a lot of moisture and high humidity. If the harvesting time and storage were not appropriate, there would be adverse phenomena such as heat damage to the wheat seeds and low germination rates. In order to overcome this phenomenon, the farm, based on past lessons, first correctly grasped the harvesting period, checked the seed moisture content before warehousing, and carried out seed drying and fine selection before sowing. Therefore, the germination rate of Yanda 1885 wheat seeds produced by the farm reached 96.6%, the purity was 99.5%, and the thousand-grain weight was 42 to 43 grams. Variable temperature soaking and chemical dressing were also carried out during sowing, and poison was sprinkled on the ground to prevent the occurrence of diseases and insect pests.

    Shuangqiao Farm also did a good job in land preparation before sowing. This year's continuous autumn rains brought great difficulties to wheat land preparation. Shuangqiao Farm organized all the machinery personnel into three shifts to work as soon as the rain stopped and the machines could cultivate the land, in order to increase the efficiency of machinery utilization and shorten the cultivation time. In order to remedy the shortcomings of late cultivation and the soil not yet well combined, rolling was implemented before sowing to make the soil dense and break up larger clods. Light harrowing was connected behind the roller to rake open the hard soil crust after rolling, reduce evaporation, and create favorable conditions for sowing operations.

    Shuangqiao Farm also used the Soviet-style forty-eight-row new-type seed drill this year, with a row spacing of 7.5 cm. In terms of close planting, it is not only more reasonable than the previous sowing method with a row spacing of 15 cm and 15 cm staggered, but also avoids the phenomenon of overlapping rows when using the twenty-four-row seed drill in the past. The opener of the forty-eight-row seed drill is very wide, and the seeds that come down are scattered in the sowing width, unlike the seeds sown by the twenty-four-row seed drill, which are all squeezed on one line. In addition, the soil covering ring attached to the seed drill is also different from that of the twenty-four-row seed drill, so it can ensure the appropriate sowing depth.

    In order to correct the shortcomings of unclear division of labor and incomplete responsibility system in the past, Shuangqiao Farm specially organized wheat planting groups this year. All land preparation, fertilization, opening drainage ditches, seed treatment, sowing, field management, and harvesting are all the responsibility of the group. Due to the clear division of responsibilities, the enthusiasm of the staff and workers is exceptionally high. This is an important reason why Shuangqiao Farm was able to sow in a timely manner this year under such special climatic conditions.

    国营双桥农场千亩冬小麦完成播种
    国营双桥农场在国庆节前夕已经胜利完成一千亩冬小麦的播种任务。在播种前，该场全体职工热烈响应增产节约的号召，总结了今年小麦丰产的经验，播种时又进一步贯彻苏联的先进经验，改进了工作方法和冬小麦播种技术。
    双桥农场在播种中使用优良品种，保证了种籽质量。今年夏秋多雨，种籽本身水分多，湿度大，假如收割时间和保管上不恰当，就会发生麦种伤热、发芽率低的不良现象。该场为了克服这种现象，根据以往教训，首先正确地掌握了收割期，入仓前检查了种籽水分，播种前又进行晒种和精选等工作，因而该场生产的燕大一八八五小麦的种籽发芽率达百分之九十六点六，纯洁度为百分之九十九点五，千粒重为四十二到四十三克。在播种时又进行了变温浸种和药剂拌种，并在地上撒毒剂，以防止病虫害的发生。
    双桥农场在播种前也做好了整地工作。今年秋雨连绵，给小麦整地带来很大困难。双桥农场于雨停后机子能耕地时，便将所有的机务人员组织起来，分成三班工作，以增加机具利用效率，缩短耕地时间。为了补救耕地过晚，耕起来的土壤还未很好结合的缺点，在播种前又实行镇压，使土壤密结并碎去较大的土块。在镇压器后面连结轻耙，耙开镇压后的硬土壳，减少蒸发，为播种作业创造了有利条件。
    双桥农场今年还使用了苏式的四十八行新式播种机，行距七点五公分，在密植上，不但比过去采用行距十五公分和十五公分交叉的播种方法更为合理，而且避免了过去使用二十四行播种机时行与行重叠的现象。四十八行播种机开沟器很宽，下来的种籽疏撒在播幅里面，不像二十四行播种机播的种子都挤在一条线上。此外，播种机所挂覆土环也和二十四行播种机的不同，因而能保证播种适当深度。
    双桥农场为了纠正过去分工不明、专责制不彻底的缺点，今年特组织了种麦小组，所有整地施肥、开排水沟、处理种籽、播种以及田间管理和收割，都由小组负责到底。由于责任分清，职工情绪异常高涨。这是双桥农场能在今年这样气候特殊情况下适时播种的重要原因。
