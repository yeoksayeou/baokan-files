The national trade in Xikang Province has greatly developed.

Xikang Province is a multi-ethnic area. According to a 1952 survey, it includes Tibetan, Miao, Hui, Mosuo, Lisu, Guzong, and Shuitian ethnic groups. In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the people of all ethnic minorities faced difficulties due to inconvenient transportation and arduous journeys for merchants. Many local specialties and livestock products could not find a market, and Tibetan people's demand for tea bricks and Yi people's need for homespun cloth and salt were often unmet.

After the liberation of Xikang in 1950, the People's Government actively established and developed trade organizations in ethnic minority areas to help people of all ethnic groups develop production and improve their lives. At present, there are 40 national trade branch companies and business offices throughout the province, an increase of seven times compared to 1950. The number of trade workers has grown from 57 in 1950 to 1,116 at present, of which the number of ethnic minority cadres has gradually increased from 4 to 125 through training. In the past three years, the total value of local specialties and livestock products such as caterpillar fungus, fritillary bulbs, musk, anemarrhena asphodeloides, rhubarb, pig bristles, and cattle and sheep skins purchased from ethnic minority people amounted to 99.7 billion yuan, and the total value of production and living materials such as tea bricks, homespun cloth, broadcloth, salt, agricultural tools, and iron pots supplied amounted to 160.8 billion yuan. Among them, for tea bricks alone, 1.29 million bricks have been supplied to Tibetan areas in the past three years. In 1952, 427,000 bricks were supplied, more than double the annual supply before liberation. Under the guidance of a fair and reasonable price policy, the ratio of local specialties exchanged for essential foreign goods in ethnic minority areas has greatly increased. For example, in 1949, every dan of Kangding wool could only be exchanged for three bricks of tea, but now it can be exchanged for 8.97 bricks, an increase of nearly two times compared to before liberation. In 1950, every dan of Zhaojue cowhide in the Yi area could only be exchanged for 15.6 jin of salt, but in July this year, it could be exchanged for 117.3 jin, an increase of 6.5 times compared to before liberation. During the same period, the amount of salt exchanged for every dan of sheepskin increased from 22 jin to 211.5 jin, an increase of 8.6 times compared to before liberation. This has played a significant role in improving the lives and developing the production of ethnic minority people. The Tibetan people said, "Chairman Mao is our living Buddha. After he came, our lives changed."

In order to develop commerce in ethnic minority areas, state-owned companies have established primary markets and developed key markets in some towns, and helped ethnic minority compatriots do business and develop ethnic stores. At present, the two key markets of Zhaojue in the Yi area and Ganzi in the Tibetan area have gradually been cultivated. Although the first half of the year was not the peak season for local products, there were still four to five hundred people attending the market every day, and the daily turnover often remained at 40 to 70 million yuan. Commerce in other areas such as Jinyang, Xide, Puxiong, and Sikai is also constantly developing. On the highways of Muli, Bamei, Daofu, Luhuo, Ganzi, Dege and other areas in the Tibetan region, there are now 1,302 Tibetan and Han merchants. Lamaseries have changed their past habit of sitting in temples waiting for business and have participated in mixed markets for trading. State-owned trading companies lead through the signing of pre-purchase and deferred sales contracts with lamaseries, and their business has gradually developed, playing a significant role in connecting Kang-Tibetan trade and revitalizing the Tibetan economy.

    西康省民族贸易有很大发展
    西康省是一个多民族地区。据一九五二年调查，计有藏、苗、回、摩些、黎苏、古宗、水田等族。各少数民族人民，过去在国民党反动派的统治下，因为交通不便，商旅运输困难，许多土特产及畜产品，都找不到销路，藏民所需要的茶包，彝民所需要的土布、食盐，经常无人供应。
    一九五○年西康解放后，人民政府为了帮助各族人民发展生产改善生活，在少数民族地区积极建立和发展贸易机构，目前，全省民族贸易分支公司和营业部共有四十个，较一九五○年增加七倍，贸易工作干部由一九五○年的五十七人，发展到目前的一千一百一十六人，其中少数民族干部经过培养由四人逐渐增加到一百二十五人。三年来收购了少数民族人民的虫草、贝母、麝香、知母、大黄、猪鬃、牛羊皮等土特产品总值九百九十七亿元，供应茶包、土布、宽布、食盐、农具、铁锅等生产、生活资料总值一千六百零八亿元。其中仅茶包一项，三年来便供应了藏区一百二十九万包，一九五二年即供应四十二万七千包，超过解放前每年供应量的
  一倍多。在公平合理的价格政策指导下，少数民族地区土特产品交换外来必需品的比率已大大提高。如一九四九年康定羊毛每担仅能换茶三包，现在可以换到八点九七包，较解放前增加近两倍。一九五○年彝区昭觉牛皮每担仅可换食盐十五点六斤，今年七月份可换到一百一十七点三斤，较解放前增加六点五倍，同一时期内羊皮每担换盐量已由二十二斤增至二百一十一点五斤，较解放前增加八点六倍。这对少数民族人民生活的改善与生产的发展，起了很大作用。藏民们说：“毛主席是我们的活菩萨，他来了后我们的生活就变了样。”
    为了发展少数民族地区商业，国营公司在一些城镇建立了初级市场和发展重点市场，并帮助少数民族同胞做生意，发展民族商店。现在彝区的昭觉和藏区的甘孜两个重点市场已逐渐培养起来，上半年虽非土产旺季，但每日都有四、五百人赶场，每天营业额也常保持四千万到七千万元。其他地区如金阳、喜德、普雄、四开等地的商业亦在不断发展。藏区木雅、八美、道孚、炉霍、甘孜、德格等公路线上，现已有藏、汉商一千三百零二户，喇嘛寺已改变了过去坐在庙内等生意的习惯，参加了混合市场进行交易。国营贸易公司通过与喇嘛寺订定预购赊销合同进行领导，业务逐渐发展，对沟通康藏贸易，和活跃藏区经济起着重大作用。
