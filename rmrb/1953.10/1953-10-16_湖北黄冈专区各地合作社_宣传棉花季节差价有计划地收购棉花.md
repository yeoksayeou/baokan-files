　　Hubei Huanggang Special District's Xinzhou, Echeng, Huangmei, and other cotton-producing counties' cooperatives are actively publicizing cotton prices and seasonal price difference policies to farmers during cotton purchasing, eliminating farmers' concerns, in order to gradually sell cotton according to national needs.

　　The cooperatives in various locations in the district first announced the seasonal prices of cotton to stabilize farmers' emotions, and then used cooperative member representative meetings and various other methods to conduct publicity and explanation work to farmers. First, they carefully calculated the changes in historical cotton prices and the reduction in industrial product prices, so that farmers understood that this year's cotton price was not low. In Fankou District, Echeng County, last year a "dan" (a unit of dry measure) of rice could buy 58.13 "jin" (a unit of weight) of soybean cake, or 15.4 "chi" (a unit of length) of white cloth, or 35.12 "jin" of salt; this year, a "dan" of rice can buy 61.5 "jin" of soybean cake, or 18.6 "chi" of white cloth, or 41.8 "jin" of salt. In addition, due to the People's Government's loan support for farmers' production and other work, farmers' increased production was also guaranteed. In this way, through the method of recollection and comparison, and careful calculation, the farmers realized that this year's cotton price is beneficial to national economic construction, and also beneficial to farmers' production and the gradual development of industrial and agricultural products.

　　Secondly, patiently publicize to cotton farmers: the seasonal price difference regulations make it convenient for farmers to sell cotton separately according to their needs. With this regulation, they will not have to delay production due to cotton sales congestion like in previous years, and the loss of cotton stored and kept by farmers can be duly compensated, so they will not suffer losses.

　　After publicity, farmers understood the significance of seasonal price differences, and with this regulation, they can sell their cotton in an orderly manner. Last year, the district produced 30 million "jin" of cotton. In September, the cooperative purchased 7.26 million "jin" of cotton. This year, the cotton output is estimated to reach 40 million "jin". In September, the cooperative purchased 3.42 million "jin" of cotton. This shows that the publicity of seasonal price differences has had an effect on purchasing work.

    湖北黄冈专区各地合作社
    宣传棉花季节差价有计划地收购棉花
    湖北省黄冈专区新洲、鄂城、黄梅等产棉县合作社，在收购棉花时，积极向农民宣传棉花价格及季节差价政策，消除农民顾虑，以逐步地按国家需要出售棉花。
    该区各地合作社首先公布了棉花季节价格，安定农民情绪，然后通过合作社社员代表会议及各种方法，向农民进行宣传解释工作。首先从棉花历史价格的变化，和工业品价格降低等方面算细账，使农民了解今年的棉花价格并不低。鄂城县樊口区去年一担谷子买豆饼五十八斤十三两，或者是白布十五尺四寸，盐三十五斤十二两；今年一担谷子就可买豆饼六十一斤五两，或白布十八尺六寸，盐四十一斤八两。另外由于人民政府对农民进行贷款扶植生产等工作，使农民增产也有了保证。这样，通过用回忆对比、算细账的方法，进行耐心的启发，农民认识到了今年的棉价既利于国家经济建设，又利于农民生产和工农业产品逐步的发展。
    其次，向棉农耐心宣传：季节差价的规定便于农民按照需要分别出售棉花，有了这个规定就不致像往年那样因售棉拥挤而耽误生产，并且农民存棉保管的损耗也可得到应有的补偿，不致吃亏。
    经过宣传，农民们知道了季节差价的意义，有了这个规定就有秩序地出售自己的棉花。去年全区产棉三千万斤，九月份内，合作社收购了七百二十六万斤棉花；今年棉花产量估计可达四千万斤，九月份内，合作社收购了三百四十二万斤棉花。这说明季节差价的宣传，已在收购工作中发生了作用。
