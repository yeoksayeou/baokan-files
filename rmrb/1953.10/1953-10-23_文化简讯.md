	Guangzhou Holds Short-Term Amateur Cantonese Opera Actor Training Class
	The Guangzhou Cantonese Opera Actor Short-Term Amateur Training Class, sponsored by the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government Cultural Bureau, held its opening ceremony on October 13th. The purpose of the training class is to cultivate young Cantonese opera actors. There are currently 111 students. Thirty-five famous Cantonese opera actors, including Bai Juorong, Luo Pinchao, Lü Yulang, Lang Junyu, Li Cuifang, and Zeng Sanduo, serve as instructors. The scheduled study period is three months, with eight hours of classes per week. Business courses are divided into three categories: performance skills, singing skills, and martial arts staging. In order to achieve greater results in teaching, the instructors have held many meetings to discuss the content of the lectures, actively prepare lessons, and expressed their intention to teach the students all their "signature skills" and "martial arts tricks." The opening of the training class has been warmly welcomed by Cantonese opera artists, who consider it a great event in the Cantonese opera world. Before the class started, the city's various opera troupes jointly held a grand farewell party to send off the enrolled artists.

	Fuzhou Holds Folk Music Performance and Observation Conference
	Fuzhou City held a folk music performance and observation conference on October 18th, 19th, and 20th. The conference had more than ten kinds of programs, many of which were performed by working people. The "Minjiang Boatman's Song" sung by the boat people on the water truly reflects the working life on the water with dance and work chants, fully demonstrating the fighting spirit and optimistic emotions of the working people. The "Jin Gu Xi" performed and sung by farmers in antiphonal style (mountain songs) has a healthy and simple tune with a strong local flavor. Another part of the beautiful program is the performance of ancient musical instruments, including the seven-stringed zither, pipa, and zheng. The seven-stringed zither is one of the oldest stringed instruments in China, and there are not many people who can play it now. The pipa solo piece is "Spring River Flower Moon Night," which describes the scene of boating on a moonlit night, with a beautiful melody that is fascinating. The seven-stringed zither's piece is "Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbar," with a melodic cadence that allows the audience to imagine the scene of flocks of geese landing on the sandy beach from far to near and from few to many. In addition, the conference also performed Fujian Province's unique folk music Yangge and storytelling, which were all enthusiastically praised by the audience.

	Departments of the Central Academy of Drama Changed to Five-Year System
	The new students enrolled in the Central Academy of Drama this year entered the school on the 15th.

	In order to meet the needs of national construction and the requirements for the specialization of drama education, the Central Academy of Drama has merged the original performance troupe and creation team with relevant departments this year and has become a professional drama academy. The academy now has departments of acting, directing, stage art, and dramatic literature. The new departments have been changed to a five-year system, and Soviet experts have been hired. It will train specialized talents for the country in acting, directing, script writing, and stage art design.

	The Central Academy of Drama was formed in October 1949 by merging the original Third Department of North China University, the original Northeast Lu Xun Academy of Arts, and the original Nanjing Drama College. In order to meet the needs of art cadres in various places, the academy has trained a large number of talents in performance and creation. In the autumn of 1950, it opened two-year departments of opera, drama, and stage art. Students in all departments have undergone relatively systematic studies of political theory, drama theory, and artistic skills training. In recent years, it has trained more than 400 art cadres of various types.

	Newly Established Central South Civil Engineering and Architectural College Opens
	The Central South Civil Engineering and Architectural College was officially established on the 16th at the original site of Hunan University on Yuelu Mountain in the suburbs of Changsha, and held an opening ceremony.

	The Central South Civil Engineering and Architectural College is formed by adjusting and merging the civil engineering departments and related majors of various universities in the Central South region, the railway department of Yunnan University in the Southwest region, and the civil engineering department and related departments and groups of Sichuan University. The college now has four undergraduate majors: industrial and civil building construction, railway construction, bridges and tunnels, and trunk roads and urban roads, as well as four specialized courses: industrial and civil building construction, railway construction, railway alignment design, and bridge structure. This year, 480 new students were enrolled.

    福州市在十月十八、十九、二十日连续举行了民间音乐会演观摩大会。大会一共有十多种节目，其中好些节目的表演者都是劳动人民。水上船民演唱的“闽江号子”，以舞蹈和号子声真实地反映出水上的劳动生活，充分表现了劳动人民的奋斗精神和乐观情绪。由农民对唱的盘诗（山歌）和演奏的“金鼓吸”，曲调健康朴实而具有浓厚的地方色彩。另一部分优美的节目是古代乐器的演奏，计有七弦琴、琵琶和筝等。七弦琴是我国最古的弦乐器之一，现在能演奏的人已不多。琵琶独奏的曲牌为“春江花月夜”，描写月夜泛舟的情景，旋律优美，令人神往。七弦琴的曲牌为“平沙落雁”，音调抑扬顿挫，使观众想像到雁群由远而近、由少而多落在沙浦上的情景。此外，大会还演出了福建省特有的民间音乐扬歌和评话等，这些节目都受到听众们热烈的赞扬。
