    Youth League Member Zhou Bingzeng Gave His Life to Rescue Children from Floodwaters

    A letter from the Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Court: On August 18th, a heavy rainstorm in Xianning County, Hubei Province, caused a flash flood, severely threatening the lives and property of the people in Huchang Township near the county seat. The county leadership held an emergency meeting and decided to organize cadres to assist in the rescue efforts. After finishing his work, Zhou Bingzeng, a Youth League member from the County People's Court, voluntarily joined two other comrades to rush to the outskirts of the city for rescue work. He and the other comrades helped the 67-year-old family member of a soldier, Tu, out of the water and onto high ground, and also rescued the 57-year-old Wen, the 76-year-old Liu, and the soldier's family member Liu Shuhui from danger. At this time, the water was waist-deep, and he saw a child of over ten years old about to be swept away by the water. The situation was extremely urgent. Single-mindedly focused on saving the child's life, he released the rope he was holding and rushed into the torrent, pulling the child over. At this point, he was exhausted from repeatedly going back and forth to rescue the masses, and he was washed under the embankment by the flood. The other two comrades quickly jumped into the water to save him, but it was too late. Comrade Zhou Bingzeng sacrificed his precious life to protect the masses.

    Comrade Zhou Bingzeng was only twenty years old this year and had not been working in the judiciary for long. He was consistently conscientious and responsible in his work, cared about the interests of the masses, and was able to correctly grasp the policies. Therefore, not long ago, he was honorably approved to join the Youth League. After his sacrifice, the people of Huchang Township were all moved and said: Only under the education of Chairman Mao and the People's Government can there be such good cadres.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    青年团员周炳曾舍身抢救洪水中的儿童
    最高人民法院中南分院来信：湖北省咸宁县八月十八日一夜大雨，山洪暴发，县城附近湖场乡群众的生命财产受到严重威胁。县领导机关召开紧急会议，决定组织干部协助抢救。县人民法院的青年团员周炳曾把工作处理完毕后，自动地随着另外两位同志奔向城外进行抢救工作。他和其他同志，将六十七岁的军属涂氏，从水中扶到高地，又将五十七岁的文氏、七十六岁的刘氏及军属刘淑惠救出险地。此时水已及腰，他看见一个十多岁的孩子要被水冲走，形势十分紧急。他一心只顾抢救孩子的生命，就放开扶手的绳子，奔入急流，将孩子拉了过来。这时，他因多次往返救护群众，已经精疲力竭，被洪水冲到堤下。另外两个同志赶紧跳入水中救他，但已来不及了。周炳曾同志为了救护群众，就这样献出了自己宝贵的生命。
    周炳曾同志今年才二十岁，参加司法工作的时间不久。他在工作中一贯认真负责，关心群众利益，并能正确掌握政策。因此，不久以前，他光荣地被批准加入青年团。他牺牲后，湖场乡的群众都感动地说：只有在毛主席、人民政府教育下才有这样的好干部。
