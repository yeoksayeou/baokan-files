Dawn Collective Farm, Yanji County, Jilin Province
Formulates Autumn and Winter Agricultural and Sideline Production Increase Plan
Respected Chairman Mao:
On the occasion of celebrating the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we report to you the production achievements since the establishment of the farm.

Under your guidance, we formulated a five-year construction plan last year. Based on last year's achievements and according to the needs of production development and the urgent demands of all members, our agricultural production cooperative has developed into a collective farm, and we have also made great achievements in production. This year, the farm has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain. The rice, millet, soybeans, and sorghum in the 53.47 hectares of dry land and 32.6 hectares of paddy fields are growing very well. Rice can yield 11,000 catties per hectare, 3,200 catties more than last year, exceeding the production increase plan by 20 percent. Millet can yield 6,000 catties per hectare, 3,000 catties more than last year. Sorghum, soybeans, etc., all yield more than last year. The production increase plan for dry land has been overfulfilled by 34 percent. In terms of sideline production: the five sows raised by the farm gave birth to a total of 100 piglets; the thirteen calves bought last year have been raised and exchanged for eleven dairy cows, of which nine dairy cows are about to give birth after being bred. In terms of cultural learning, the villagers all attend peasant schools or study in reading groups, and some can already read newspapers and the "New Countryside" magazine.

We are able to overfulfill the first year's plan in this way, which is inseparable from your correct leadership. Under your leadership, we have improved agricultural technology. We learned from the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, and 70 percent of the dry land achieved equal-distance wide sowing and phased topdressing; we learned from the high-yield experience of paddy fields, and all paddy fields in the village achieved comprehensive seedling cultivation and equal-distance dense planting. Due to the promotion of these new cultivation methods, dry and paddy fields can increase production by 100,000 catties in total. Under your leadership, we fought against various disasters. During a heavy rain in the summer, seeing that the flash flood was about to wash away the rice in a field, all the male and female villagers bravely rescued all the rice in the storm. When tent caterpillars occurred in the fields, we promptly organized the remaining labor force to dig 800-meter-long ditches around the fields to eliminate all the insects. When cutworms were found in seven mu of soybean fields and seven hectares of millet, we used "666" powder to eliminate all the insects. In this way, although there were many kinds of disasters this year, except for a hectare and five mu of millet land that suffered reduced production due to insect pests, all other crops can achieve a bumper harvest. In production, we have experienced the superiority of the collective farm. This year, the promotion of new cultivation methods, coupled with more than 40 days of rain during summer hoeing, made it impossible to weed in time, requiring more labor. We implemented a work quota system, and all villagers demonstrated a high degree of labor discipline and enthusiasm, solving the problem of insufficient labor.

Since the establishment of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region, our unity with the Han brothers has also been further consolidated through the production process. When we were learning the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, the Han comrades enthusiastically taught us the practice of using the "Hui Ba" and the method of feeding horses. We also taught the Han comrades the method of paddy field cultivation, and their paddy rice is very good this year.

Respected Chairman Mao, according to the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, we have formulated an autumn production increase plan to ensure careful harvesting, careful pulling, careful threshing, and careful storage, increasing income by more than 5,000 catties of grain. Now we have prepared sickles, agricultural vehicles, threshing machines, warehouses, etc., and all villagers are guaranteed to harvest, bundle, pull, thresh, and autumn plow as soon as they are ripe. In order to prepare for next year's production increase, we have accumulated 3,000 carts of fertilizer, selected various fine seeds, and plan to hold a small-scale technical training class this winter to enable villagers to learn advanced agricultural techniques. In addition, this winter we will also organize villagers to carry out sideline businesses such as wood transportation and weaving straw bags, and strive to better complete the production increase and economy plan.

### 吉林省延吉县黎明集体农庄  制订了秋冬两季农副业增产计划

    吉林省延吉县黎明集体农庄
    制订了秋冬两季农副业增产计划敬爱的毛主席：
    在庆祝中华人民共和国成立四周年的时候，我们向您报告建庄以来的生产成绩。
    我们在您的教导下，去年制订了五年建设计划。在去年成绩的基础上，根据生产发展的需要和全体社员的迫切要求，我们的农业生产合作社发展为集体农庄，在生产上也有了很大的成绩。今年农庄的粮食得到前所未有的丰收。五十三垧四亩七分旱田和三十二垧六亩水田的稻子、谷子、大豆、高粱都长得很好。稻子一垧可打一万一千斤，比去年多打三千二百斤，超过增产计划百分之二十。谷子一垧可打六千斤，比去年多打三千斤。高粱、大豆等都比去年多打。旱田增产计划超额完成百分之三十四。在副业生产方面：农庄所养的五只母猪共下了一百只小猪；去年买进的十三头牛犊养大后已换买了十一头乳牛，其中九头乳牛经过配种快要下牛犊了。在文化学习方面，庄员们都上农民学校或在读报组内学习，有的已经能读报纸和“新农村”杂志了。
    我们能够这样超额完成第一年的计划，是和您的正确领导分不开的。我们在您的领导下，改进了农业技术。我们学习了肇源丰产经验，百分之七十的旱田做到了等距宽播，分期追肥；学习了水田丰产经验，全庄水田做到综合性育苗和等距密植。由于推广了这些新的耕作法，水旱田共能增产十万斤。在您的领导下，我们和各种灾害进行了斗争。在夏季有一次下暴雨时，眼看山洪要将一片田地的稻子冲去，全体男女庄员就奋不顾身地在暴风雨下把稻子全部救了出来。地里发生天幕毛虫时，我们及时组织剩余劳动力在地周围挖了八百公尺长沟，把虫子全部扑灭。在七亩黄豆地和七垧谷子发现夜盗虫时，我们又用“六六六”粉将虫全部消灭。这样，虽然今年各种灾害多，但除了一垧五亩谷子地因受到虫害而减产外，其它庄稼全部可以丰收。在生产中，我们体会了集体农庄的优越性。今年推广新耕作法，再加夏锄时下了四十多天雨未能及时锄草，需要更多的劳动力。我们实行了工作定额制，全体庄员发挥了高度的劳动纪律性和积极性，解决了劳动力不足的问题。
    自从延边朝鲜族自治区成立以后，我们与汉族兄弟的团结也通过生产过程而更加巩固了。在我们学习肇源丰产经验时，汉族同志热情地把“耲耙”的作法和马的饲养法教给我们。我们也教给汉族同志水田耕作法，今年他们的水田稻子很不错。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们根据增产节约的精神，订出了秋季增产计划，保证细割、细拉、细打、细保仓，增收五千多斤粮食。现在我们已准备好镰刀、农车、打稻机、仓库等，全体庄员都保证做到随熟、随割、随捆、随拉、随打、随秋耕。为了给明年增产作好准备，我们已经积肥三千车，选好各种良种，并计划在今年冬天召开小型技术训练班，使庄员学会先进农业技术。此外，今冬我们还要组织庄员进行木材运搬和织草袋等副业，为更好地完成增产节约计划而努力。
