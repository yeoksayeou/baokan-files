On the western edge of China's Northwest Frontier—west of Stalin Avenue in Yining City, Xinjiang Province—nestled among groves of poplar trees stands a magnificent building: the newly constructed schoolhouse of the Ili Senior Girls' Middle School, built by the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government for the people of all ethnicities. The facilities of this senior middle school are quite good. The laboratory boasts over a hundred scientific instruments; the newly established library already houses a selection of books. Additionally, there are sports grounds, basketball courts, volleyball courts... The students themselves have also organized ethnic singing groups and orchestras.

Studying here are over five hundred female students from six ethnic groups, including Uyghur, Kazakh, Uzbek, Tatar, Kyrgyz, and Hui. Some are shepherdesses from the Tian Shan pasturelands; others are the daughters of farmers from the Ili River Valley... They help each other in their studies and care for each other in their lives. Although they have different aspirations: some want to become engineers, some want to become pilots, doctors, or teachers, they all share a common goal: to master skills and build the motherland.

Teachers enthusiastically guide students in their studies.

Physics teacher Abulajin explains electrical testing instruments to the students.

Geography teacher Sakodati (Uyghur) is teaching a geography lesson to the students.

The school's Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers organizations ensure that the school completes its teaching tasks. This is a scene of the Youth League members gathering to study the weekly study plan. Teacher Reziya (Uyghur) often helps students answer questions in her spare time.

These are Kyrgyz female student Tursunai (front) and Kazakh female student Gaohar (back). Tursunai is only sixteen years old and comes from a laborer's family in the deep mountains on the border. In the past, like other Kyrgyz people, she had no opportunity to study, and only began attending school after liberation. Her ambition is to become a doctor and return to her hometown to serve the Kyrgyz people. Gaohar is the daughter of a herdsman in the Tian Shan pasturelands and a member of the Communist Youth League. After seeing pictures of the first group of female pilots in New China in a pictorial, she was determined to strive to become a pilot, study hard, and pay attention to physical exercise.

When the school's Young Pioneers have a team day, they often invite teachers to tell them stories of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's battles and stories of industrial and agricultural production models from all over the country.

The school is very concerned about the health of the students. In addition to equipping sports grounds and various ball courts for students to exercise, the clinic's doctors also regularly examine the students.

During holidays, local students often invite students from other places to visit.

Students promote the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship in their studies. These two students, Yibisar and Talihan, are concentrating on their studies.

    在我国西北边陲——新疆省伊宁市斯大林大街西口，白杨树丛中有一座壮丽的楼房，这就是新疆省人民政府为各族人民新建的伊犁高级女子中学的校舍。这个高级中学的设备相当好。实验室里有着一百多种科学仪器；刚刚设立的图书馆里已经分藏了一部分图书。此外还有运动场、篮球场、排球场……。同学们自己还组织了民族的歌咏队和乐队。
    在这里学习的有维吾尔、哈萨克、乌兹别克、塔塔尔、柯尔克孜和回族等六个民族的五百多名女同学。有的是来自天山牧区的牧羊姑娘；有的是来自伊犁河谷的农民的女儿……。她们在学习上互相帮助，在生活上互相关怀。虽然她们有着不同的志愿：有的想作工程师，有的想作飞行员、医生或者教员，但她们有一个共同的目标：学好本领，建设祖国。

    教师热情地指导学生学习。
    物理教员阿布拉奇木向同学们讲解电器试验仪。
    地理教员萨柯达提（维族）正向同学们讲地理课。
    学校的青年团和少先队的组织保证了学校完成教学任务。这是青年团员们集会研究一周学习计划的情形。教员热孜亚（维族）经常在课余时间帮助同学解答问题。
    这是柯族女同学吐尔素乃（前）和哈族女同学高哈尔（后）。吐尔素乃是来自国境深山里的一个雇工的女儿，才十六岁。过去，她和其他柯族同胞一样没有读书的机会，解放后才开始上学。她的志愿是当一个医生，回到家乡去为柯尔克孜族同胞服务。高哈尔是天山牧区的一个牧工的女儿，青年团员。她从画报上看到新中国第一批女飞行员的图片以后，就决心争取当飞行员，努力学习，并注意锻炼体格。
    学校的少先队在过队日的时候，常常邀请老师给她们讲中国人民志愿军的战斗故事和全国各地的工农业生产模范的故事。
    学校非常关心同学们的健康，除了设备运动场、各种球场供同学们锻炼身体之外，医疗所的医生还定期为同学们检查身体。
    每逢假日，住在当地的同学常请外地来的同学去作客。
    同学们在学习上发扬了互助友爱的精神。这两位同学依比撒尔和塔里汗正在专心地研究功课。
