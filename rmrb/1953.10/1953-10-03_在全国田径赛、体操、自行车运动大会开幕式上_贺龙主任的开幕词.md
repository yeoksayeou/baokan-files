    At the National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Games Opening Ceremony
    Opening Address by Director He Long
    The 1953 National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Games opens today in the capital, Beijing, on the second day of our nation's celebration of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    Participating in this games are ten units, including the six major administrative regions of North China, East China, Northeast China, Central and South China, Southwest China, Northwest China, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, as well as the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the China Railway Sports Association, and the Burmese Overseas Chinese Sports Delegation. The athletes come from all regions, nationalities, and different production, defense, work, and study posts across the country. On behalf of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, allow me to extend a warm welcome and greetings to all the athletes and sports workers participating in this games.
    This games is the first national track and field, gymnastics, and cycling games since the founding of New China, and also the largest national sports event ever held. This games is also being held in a new historical period in our country, the beginning of the implementation of planned economic construction. In this new historical period, the task of the people of the whole country is to work together to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and gradually transition to socialism. Therefore, our games will review the achievements of track and field, gymnastics, and cycling over the past four years, promote the popularization and improvement of these sports among the people, and further encourage and promote more people to participate in sports, exercise, and improve their health, so as to exert greater strength in the cause of building the motherland and defending peace.
    Since the founding of New China, under the care and advocacy of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, our sports cause has established the correct direction of serving the people's health, economic construction, and national defense construction, and has made great progress. Mass sports activities and sports competitions have been widely carried out in schools and troops, and are gradually being carried out in factories, government agencies, and rural areas. A new sports moral style has been basically established, and the technical level of various sports is also constantly improving. These achievements have fundamentally changed the situation in which sports in the old society were only available to a few people, and demonstrated that the development of people's sports in our country has a bright and broad future.
    However, this is only a good start. Due to the weak foundation in the past, at present, the development of sports is still far from meeting the needs of the country and the people. The country has begun planned economic construction, and the people's health level and labor efficiency need to be actively improved and enhanced. Sports workers and athletes across the country must continue to redouble their efforts to improve their political and professional level, to carry out mass sports activities, and to realize Chairman Mao's great call to "develop sports and enhance the people's physique." This is a major and glorious long-term task before us.
    Track and field and gymnastics are the best ways to enhance physical fitness and give the human body comprehensive exercise, and they are also necessary auxiliary exercises to improve the skills of other sports. The foundation of track and field and gymnastics in our country was very weak in the past, and it is particularly necessary to vigorously promote and popularize them. We believe that the holding of this games will play a great role in promoting sports in our country, especially track and field and gymnastics.
    Riding a bicycle is a very good exercise for physical fitness. Bicycles are also a common and popular means of transportation in our country. Therefore, this sport is well worth continuing to promote and further improve its skills.
    The athletes participating in this games are the most outstanding track and field, gymnastics, and cycling athletes selected from the masses at all levels. I hope that in the games, the athletes will carry forward the revolutionary competitive spirit of high patriotism and collectivism, and carry forward the new sports moral style of courage, strength, unity, friendship, not being arrogant in victory, and not being discouraged in defeat. We must learn from each other, exchange experiences, and draw lessons from each other, so as to achieve great progress and improvement in both ideology and technology.
    I hope that in this games, athletes will not only strive to create new personal records, but also strive to create new national records, and continue to study hard and practice hard, and make unremitting efforts to create more, higher, and more brilliant achievements.
    I also hope that after the athletes return to their posts, they will become propagandists, organizers, and technical instructors of sports in grassroots units such as schools, factories, troops, and government agencies, and become active members in carrying out mass sports activities.
    During this games, the Soviet sports delegation is visiting our country, and we will be honored to see the outstanding demonstration performances of the world's best Soviet gymnasts. This is a good opportunity for us to learn from the advanced Soviet gymnastics and sports. On behalf of all sports workers and athletes in our country, I extend a warm welcome and deep respect to our distinguished guests, the friends of the Soviet sports delegation.
    I wish the games success! I wish everyone good health! (Attached picture)

    在全国田径赛、体操、自行车运动大会开幕式上
    贺龙主任的开幕词
    一九五三年全国田径赛、体操、自行车运动大会，今天在我们全国人民庆祝中华人民共和国成立四周年的第二天，在首都北京开幕了。
    参加这次大会的有华北、华东、东北、中南、西南、西北六大行政区、内蒙古自治区以及中国人民解放军、中国火车头体育协会、缅甸华侨体育观光代表团等十个单位。运动员们来自全国各个地区、各个民族、各个不同的生产、国防、工作和学习岗位。让我代表中央人民政府体育运动委员会向参加这次大会的全体运动员和体育工作者致以热烈的欢迎和慰问。
    这次大会是新中国成立以来第一次全国田径赛、体操、自行车运动大会，也是规模最大的一次全国性运动会。这次大会也是在我国开始实施有计划的经济建设这一新的历史时期召开的。在这个新的历史时期，全国人民的任务是一致努力，为逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化和逐步地过渡到社会主义而奋斗。因为这样，我们这次大会就要检阅四年来田径、体操、自行车运动的成绩，促进这些运动在人民群众中的普及和提高，进一步鼓舞和推动更多的人民群众参加体育运动，锻炼身体，提高健康水平，以便在建设祖国和保卫和平的事业中，发挥更大的力量。
    新中国成立以来，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的关怀和倡导下，我们的体育事业，确立了为人民的健康、经济建设和国防建设而服务的正确方向，并有了很大的发展。群众性的体育活动和运动竞赛已经在学校和部队里广泛地开展起来，在工厂、机关和农村中也正在逐步开展。新的运动道德作风基本上树立了，各项运动的技术水平也在不断地提高。这些成就使得旧社会体育运动仅为少数人所占有的情况起了根本的变化，并说明了在我们国家里，人民体育事业的发展有着美好而宽阔的前途。
    但是，这仅仅是良好的开端。由于过去的基础薄弱，目前，体育运动的发展距离国家和人民的需要还很远。国家已经开始了有计划的经济建设，人民的健康水平和劳动效率有待于积极地改善和增强。全国的体育工作者和运动员要继续加倍地努力提高政治和业务水平，来开展群众性体育运动，实现毛主席的“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的伟大号召，这是摆在我们面前的重大而光荣的长期任务。
    田径和体操运动是增强体质，使人体得到全面锻炼的最好方法，也是提高其他各项运动技术的必要的辅助运动。我国田径和体操运动的基础在过去是很薄弱的，特别需要大力提倡和推广。我们相信这次大会的举行，对我国的体育运动，特别是田径和体操运动会起着很大的推动作用。
    骑自行车是一项锻炼身体的很好的运动。自行车也是我国较普遍和人民所喜爱的一种交通工具。因此，这项运动很值得继续推广，并进一步提高技术。
    参加这次大会的运动员，都是经过逐级选拔，从群众中来的最优秀的田径、体操、自行车运动选手。我希望在大会中，运动员们要发扬高度的爱国主义和集体主义的革命竞赛精神，发扬勇敢、坚强、团结、友爱、胜不骄、败不馁的新的运动道德作风。要互相观摩、互相学习、交流经验、吸取教训，以便在思想上和技术上都能得到很大的进步和提高。
    我希望在这次大会中，运动员们不但要努力地创造个人的新纪录，而且要争取创造国家的新纪录，并且要继续勤学苦练，为创造更多、更高、更光辉的成绩而作坚持不懈的努力。
    我还希望运动员们回到自己的岗位以后，要成为各个学校、工厂、部队和机关等基层单位中体育运动的宣传者、组织者以及技术指导者，成为开展群众性体育运动的积极分子。
    在这次大会期间，正值苏联体育代表团来我国访问，我们将荣幸地看到全世界最优秀的苏联体操运动员的卓越的示范表演。这是我们学习先进的苏联体操运动和体育运动的一次很好的机会。我代表我国全体体育工作者和运动员向我们的贵宾——苏联体育代表团的朋友们，表示热烈的欢迎和深切的敬意。
    预祝大会成功！祝各位健康！（附图片）
