Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 30th:

    The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a meeting to inspect and study the comprehensive development of the production increase and conservation campaign in the city's factories, basic construction departments, state-owned commercial departments, and government offices, and pointed out the direction for the future.
    Since the full-scale launch of the production increase and conservation campaign in Shenyang in mid-September, significant achievements have been made. State-owned and locally state-owned factories have combined the competition with regular work, strengthened planning management and technical management, and established and implemented various responsibility systems accordingly. As a result, eighty-five factories exceeded their third-quarter plans. Basic construction sites have increased their daily progress from 0.4 to 0.5 percent in July and August to over 1 percent in the production increase and conservation competition. As of early October, 77.3 percent of the annual plan has been completed. Employees of state-owned commercial institutions and cooperatives have actively taken action. Employees of the Coal Construction Company have developed a straight-line transportation management method, saving a significant amount of management costs. Leaders of some units have gone deep into the grassroots to conduct inspections and provide assistance. The production increase and conservation campaign in government offices has also been largely launched. According to statistics from twenty-two units, approximately 100 billion yuan can be saved by the end of the year from expenditure reduction alone.
    However, the campaign has been uneven across the city. Generally, the industrial system is better, the basic construction and state-owned commercial departments are relatively poor, and the cooperatives and government offices are even worse. Within each system, some units have made remarkable achievements, while others have just begun. Some departments and units are not clear enough about the policy of increasing production and practicing economy. In factories, some only focus on increasing production, neglecting conservation and quality; some pit increasing production and practicing economy against strengthening planning management; some only focus on current production increases and conservation, neglecting future production preparation work. Some basic construction departments have negative tendencies to save materials passively and only focus on progress while neglecting quality. Some units in state-owned commercial and cooperative departments only focus on making more money and do not pay attention to financial work, or only have production increase and conservation plans but lack specific measures. Most government offices pay attention to saving pens, ink, and paper, but do not focus on improving work efficiency.
    Huang Oudong, Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, put forward the following opinions in his conclusion regarding the city's future production increase and conservation campaign: (1) Leading cadres of factories, enterprises, and departments must further clarify the significance of increasing production and practicing economy, and link this movement with the implementation of the general line and general tasks, and then gradually make the broad masses of workers and staff also understand it. (2) Continue to strengthen the work of the production increase and conservation inspection teams, and specifically solve problems through inspection work, so that the weak departments and links can catch up with the advanced ones. (3) Factories and enterprises must closely combine the production increase and conservation campaign with regular work such as planning management and technical management, improve the level of enterprise management through the production increase and conservation campaign, and at the same time complete the production increase and conservation plan by strengthening planning management, technical management, and other work. (4) It is necessary to establish a focus on key tasks. In factories, resolutely complete the products needed by the state, and oppose the erroneous practice of only completing production increase and conservation figures as the goal. For example, the wrong practice of the Heavy Machinery Plant failing to complete the state's required production increase plan for crushers, while increasing the production of other products that are easier to increase, should be corrected. At the same time, a comprehensive perspective must be established. Not only pay attention to increasing production, but also pay attention to conservation, improving quality, and reducing costs. (5) Basic construction departments should focus on ensuring quality and completing progress; state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives should focus on actively organizing sources of goods, expanding sales, ensuring supply, and reducing commodity circulation costs; government offices should reduce expenditures as much as possible, but should focus on improving work efficiency. In addition, it is also necessary to continue to oppose bureaucracy in the production increase and conservation campaign.

    沈阳市全面检查增产节约情况
    【新华社沈阳三十日电】中共沈阳市委员会最近召开会议，检查研究了全市工厂、基本建设部门、国营商业部门和机关增产节约运动的全面开展情况，并指出了今后的方向。
    沈阳市增产节约运动自九月中旬全面开展以来，已做出很大成绩。国营和地方国营工厂在竞赛中结合经常工作，加强计划管理和技术管理，相应的建立和贯彻各项责任制度，因此有八十五个工厂超额完成了第三季度计划。各基本建设工地在增产节约竞赛中，每天的进度由七、八月份的百分之零点四到零点五，提高到百分之一以上。到十月上旬为止，已完成全年计划的百分之七十七点三。国营商业机构和合作社的职工已积极行动起来。煤建公司的职工研究出直线运输的管理方法，节省了很大一笔管理费用。有些单位的领导干部已深入下层进行检查和帮助。机关中的增产节约运动也已大部开展起来。据二十二个单位的统计，仅紧缩开支一项，到年底大约可节省一千亿元左右。
    但就全市来说，运动开展得不平衡。一般情况是工业系统比较好，基本建设和国营商业部门比较差，合作社和机关更差。在各个系统中，有的单位已做出显著成绩，有的单位还才开始。有些部门和单位对增产节约的方针还不够明确。在工厂中，有的只顾增产，忽略节约和质量；有的把增产节约和加强计划管理工作对立起来；有的只顾当前增产节约，忽略今后的生产准备工作。有些基本建设部门存在消极的节约器材和只顾进度而忽视质量的偏向。国营商业和合作社部门的某些单位，只顾多卖钱而不注意财务工作，或者只有增产节约计划而缺乏具体措施。机关中大多注意节省笔墨纸张，而没有以提高工作效率为主。
    中共沈阳市委书记黄欧东在结论中对今后全市增产节约运动提出了下列意见：（一）各工厂、企业部门单位的领导干部必须进一步明确增产节约的意义，把这一运动和贯彻总路线总任务联系起来认识，进而使广大职工群众也逐渐明确起来。（二）继续加强增产节约检查组的工作，通过检查工作具体解决问题，使工作薄弱的部门和环节赶上先进的。（三）工厂企业中必须把增产节约运动和计划管理、技术管理等经常工作密切结合起来，通过增产节约运动把企业管理水平提高一步，同时又通过加强计划管理、技术管理等工作完成增产节约计划。（四）要树立重点思想。在工厂中坚决完成国家需要的产品，反对只以完成增产节约数字为目的。如重型机器厂不能完成国家需要的破碎机的增产计划，而增产其他容易增产的产品的错误做法应该纠正。同时，要树立全面观点。不仅要注意增产，而且要注意节约、提高质量和降低成本。（五）基本建设部门应以保证质量完成进度为主；国营商业部门和合作社应以积极组织货源，扩大销售额，保证供应，降低商品流转费用为主；机关中要尽可能紧缩开支，但应以提高工作效率为主。此外，在增产节约运动中还要继续反对官僚主义。
