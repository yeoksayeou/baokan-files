    Develop People's Spoken Drama Art
    Hong Shen
    Spoken drama in our country has a fighting history of nearly fifty years, especially in the great struggles during the Anti-Japanese War, the Liberation War, and in recent years, the Resist-America Aid-Korea campaign, social reforms, and even national construction, it has played its combat role. The spoken drama since the May Fourth Movement has consistently inspired the masses with revolutionary spirit and patriotism, laying the foundation for the realistic tradition of spoken drama in our country. Since Chairman Mao delivered his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, the literary and art circles have undergone ideological transformation, learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers. Spoken drama and other literature and art have further clearly recognized the path of socialist realism. This is a huge progress in the art of spoken drama in our country, from playwriting to performing arts. This huge progress is primarily reflected in the subject matter, themes, and creative methods of playwriting, and also in the performing arts of spoken drama. Spoken drama actors strive to learn from life, strive to improve their ideological qualities, so that their performances can fully express the themes of the plays and maximize the combat effectiveness of the theater. Actors have made gratifying achievements in performing the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and new heroic figures among the masses. Precisely because of this, spoken drama in New China has gradually expanded its position among the masses and won over more and more audiences. While vigorously promoting the reform of traditional opera, the People's Government also uses great efforts to develop new spoken drama art. State-run spoken drama theaters and troupes have been established in the capital, major cities, and provinces and municipalities, currently numbering forty-four. The central government has also established specialized academies to cultivate specialized spoken drama talent in a planned manner.
    However, it is undeniable that the history of spoken drama is relatively short, its influence among the masses is not yet widespread, its artistic foundation is not solid enough, and the spoken drama undertaking is not yet prosperous enough. Taking the Beijing People's Art Theatre as an example, performances are not frequent, and audiences find it very difficult to see spoken drama performances. The lack of new plays and performance activities seriously hinders the smooth development of the current spoken drama art. Under such circumstances, it is difficult for spoken drama to accumulate experience, cultivate actors, and meet the needs of the broad masses.
    Our theaters and troupes demand to stage plays reflecting the current sharp struggles, and this demand is entirely justified. Playwrights should create more such plays, so that they gradually become the main content of spoken drama performances. However, currently playwriting is not yet vigorous enough, and the quality of works is not yet very high, so theater groups are "waiting for materials to start work" for a long time, and actors are distressed because they cannot perform frequently. This is ultimately not a normal situation. At present, on the one hand, we need to take various measures to develop and improve spoken drama creation; on the other hand, when arranging performance programs, performing groups should also consider this actual situation of supply and demand mismatch, and try to take some practical and feasible active steps. First of all, when it comes to newly created plays reflecting current real struggles, our demands can be more realistic; as long as the play does not violate the basic principles of socialist realism in its general inclination, even if it still has some shortcomings and its artistic power is not strong enough, such a play can still be adopted as a performance program, striving to cooperate with the author to gradually enrich it in performance. Currently, our drama criticism is not very vigorous, and criticism itself still has shortcomings; and our theater groups listen to criticism even less than playwrights. If a play is welcomed by the audience and produces a positive effect, but the theater group hears some criticism from the literary and art circles or from the audience, it immediately loses its position, or, without the cooperation of the writer, hastily cuts or patches up the play according to all the opinions it hears, even contradictory ones, or, after performing it for a while, abandons the program altogether. Some theater groups, although suffering from a long-term lack of plays to perform, are unwilling to adopt plays that are basically good but have some shortcomings. The reason is simply "I heard that this play has been criticized"; as for whether the criticism is appropriate and how serious the shortcomings are, they are unwilling to carefully analyze it. If this abnormal situation continues, it will be neither conducive to cultivating playwrights nor conducive to cultivating actors, and it will also be detrimental to the interests of the masses.
    Performing more outstanding Soviet socialist realist plays will greatly benefit our country's spoken drama art and our audiences. Spoken drama groups in the capital and other places have recently paid attention to this point, but obviously not enough. Some theater groups seem very apologetic when they perform foreign plays; little do they know that introducing excellent Soviet works to the audience and promoting socialist ideology is a very honorable thing. We are only afraid that we have done too little of such good things.
    In order to inherit the experience of previous spoken drama movements and to enrich the content of our performance programs, spoken drama groups may also appropriately select excellent plays with revolutionary democratic content since the May Fourth Movement, as well as foreign classical masterpieces that suit the tastes of Chinese audiences. As long as these programs are selected appropriately, and supplemented with proper publicity and evaluation work, they will only help enrich the spiritual life of the working people in our country, and will not be harmful in any way.
    Adopting the various methods mentioned above to enrich our performance programs is a principle that has gradually been accepted by the theater circles, but it is always very difficult to implement. The main obstacle is: our spoken drama groups have not established a normal program performance system, have not built their own repertoire, do not have the habit of regularly announcing batches of programs to the masses, and have not learned from our country's traditional opera groups and foreign drama theaters in accumulating performance programs and maintaining frequent performances. Since our spoken drama groups do not perform frequently, but only occasionally perform once or twice a year, the audience of course has ample reason to demand that the themes expressed in the programs are the most realistic and sharpest, the ideological and artistic qualities are very high, and the performing arts are top-notch. The less frequently a theater group performs, the more each performance takes on the nature of a grand reopening, and the higher the audience's expectations for it. At the same time, since actors do not perform frequently, they have few opportunities to practice on stage, and their acting skills are difficult to improve, and the results of the performance are more likely to disappoint the audience. To change this situation, the theater group must gradually accumulate its own repertoire. Any programs that have been welcomed by the audience in the past and can be welcomed by the audience in the future must not be easily abandoned, but must be continuously polished on the stage with excellence. The theater should try to announce to the audience in advance the batches of programs that it plans to perform in rotation in the next six months or a year, which may include newly created plays, translated plays, adapted plays, and excellent plays since the May Fourth Movement; there are plays that depict the current real struggles, and there are also plays that, although they are historical or foreign themes, but with their realistic inspiring power, also produce a positive effect on the spiritual life of the masses, so as to exercise the diverse expressive abilities of the actors and meet the diverse interests and requirements of the masses. Each program is not performed for a few months and then "discarded like old shoes," but rather several programs are performed in rotation on a regular basis, so as to maintain the regular performance of the theater and maintain the regular contact between the theater group and the masses, so as to avoid being cold for a while and then hot for a while, making it difficult for the audience to remember the names of the theater group and the actors, and making it difficult to cultivate the habit of going to the spoken drama theater to see plays regularly.
    There must be regular performances in order to create conditions for the improvement of performing arts and the improvement of various theater arts.
    To improve performing arts, the fundamental issue is that actors must establish a habit of hard study. Performing art is a very complex and difficult art, and there are too many things that actors need to learn. Actors must systematically study Marxism-Leninism and the artistic theory of socialist realism, so as to improve their ability to observe and analyze social life and artistic works. They must improve their political qualities and moral qualities, so as to give play to the combativeness of stage art and ensure that they do not distort the spirit of heroic figures when performing them. Actors must constantly learn from life, constantly pay attention to observing social life and all kinds of characters and their psychology, and accumulate rich perceptual knowledge, so that their artistic creation has a basis. They must constantly read literary works to improve their literary cultivation. They must constantly engage in the exercise of performing art skills, as well as basic training such as physical training, recitation, and speaking lines. In short, there are many things that he needs to learn, and these things are indispensable. If he is not good at mastering time, establishing habits of hard study, independent research, and perseverance, but only relies on a little cleverness, relies on a little hearsay learning, or simply relies on the cultivation of superiors, then he can never become a good actor. However, in our actors' lives, the phenomena of freedom, looseness, advocating empty talk, empty complaints, and even talking about irrelevant matters have not been completely eradicated. In our actors' lives, we need to universally establish a new atmosphere of hard study.
    How to combine the research and study of Stanislavski's performance system with the practice of our performance activities is the most pressing issue at present. The translation and introduction of performing art theory certainly needs to be carried out more systematically, but currently it is more necessary to conduct a wide range of popularization of scientific performance theory among actors. At present, there is a need for in-depth and easy-to-understand works suitable for the level of our actors, and a need to expound Stanislavski's theoretical principles based on our country's performing experience and performance examples, so that they can be easily understood and mastered by ordinary actors. At the same time, spoken drama actors should also constantly learn from outstanding traditional opera actors in our country, constantly watch traditional opera performances, and make friends with traditional opera actors; not to imitate their performances in form, but to absorb the essence of their realistic expression methods; such as their ability to typify, their ability to emphasize exaggeration, their ability to express meticulously and concisely, the stability and sculptural feeling of their movements, their ability to master language, and their ability to master the emotions of the audience. Our constant learning from traditional opera actors will be of great benefit to making spoken drama art further acquire national style and further suit the tastes and appreciation habits of Chinese audiences.

    发展人民的话剧艺术
    洪深
    话剧在我国有将近五十年的奋斗历史，特别是在抗日战争、解放战争和近年的抗美援朝、社会改革以至国家建设时期的各种伟大斗争中，发挥了它的战斗作用。“五四”以来的话剧，一贯地以革命精神和爱国精神鼓舞群众，奠定了我国话剧的现实主义传统。自从毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上发表讲话以来，文艺界经过思想改造，向工农兵学习，话剧和其他文学艺术，进一步明确认识了社会主义现实主义的道路。这是我国话剧艺术从剧本创作到表演艺术的一个巨大的进步。这个巨大的进步，首先表现在剧本创作的题材范围、主题思想和创作方法上，同时也表现在话剧的表演艺术上。话剧演员们力求向生活学习，力求提高自己的思想品质，使自己的表演能充分发挥剧本的主题思想，发挥剧场的战斗效果。演员在表演工农兵形象和群众中新英雄人物形象上，取得了可喜的成就。正因为这样，新中国的话剧在群众中就逐渐扩大了阵地，争取了越来越多的观众。人民政府在大力推行戏曲改革的同时，也用很大力量来发展新的话剧艺术。在首都、各大城市和各省、市建立了国家经营的话剧院、话剧团，目前已有四十四个，中央还建立了专门的学院，有计划地培养话剧的专门人材。
    但是无可讳言的，话剧的历史还比较短，话剧在群众中的影响还不够普遍，话剧本身的艺术基础还不够坚实，话剧事业目前还是不够兴旺的。就北京的话剧剧院来说，演出是不经常的，观众很不容易看到话剧的演出。新的剧本少，演出活动少，严重妨碍了目前话剧艺术的顺利发展。在这种情况下，话剧就很难积累经验，培养演员，并满足广大群众的需要。
    我们的剧院、剧团要求上演反映当前尖锐斗争题材的剧本，这种要求是完全正当的。剧作家应当多多创作这样的剧本，使逐渐成为话剧上演节目中的主要内容。可是，目前剧本创作还不够旺盛，作品质量还不算很高，剧团因此长期地“停工待料”，演员因不能经常演戏而苦闷，这究竟不是正常的办法。目前，我们一方面需要采取各种措施发展和提高话剧创作；另一方面演出团体在安排上演剧目的时候，也应当考虑到这种供求脱节的实际状况，设法采取一些切实可行的积极步骤。首先，在对待新创作的反映当前现实斗争题材的剧本，我们的要求还可以更实事求是一些；只要剧本在总的倾向上不违反社会主义现实主义的基本原则，即令它还存在着部分的缺点，艺术的力量还不够强，这样的剧本仍然可以采作上演节目，争取和作者合作在演出中逐渐丰富它。目前我们的戏剧批评还很不旺盛，批评本身也还是有缺点的；而我们的剧团较之剧作家更加听不得批评的意见。一个剧本在上演中受到了观众欢迎，产生了积极作用，可是听到了来自文艺界或来自观众的某些批评，剧团便马上失掉了主张，或者在没有取得作家的合作下，根据听得的所有意见，甚至是互相矛盾的意见，慌忙地对剧本进行剪裁或挖补，或者演出一阵之后，从此就抛弃了这个剧目。有的剧团虽然长期苦于无戏可演，但也不肯采用基本上是好的却有部分缺点的剧本。理由只是“听说这个剧本已经受到批评了”；至于批评得是否恰当，缺点严重到什么程度，却不肯细心地分析它。这种不正常的状况如果继续下去，是既不利于培养剧作者，也不利于培养演员的，对群众的利益也是有损失的。
    多多上演苏联的社会主义现实主义的优秀剧本，对我国话剧艺术，对我国观众，都会有很大的利益。首都及各地的话剧团体近来已注意到这一点，但显然还是注意得不够的。有的剧团上演了外国剧本似乎很觉歉然；殊不知向观众介绍了苏联的优秀作品，宣传了社会主义思想，原是非常光荣的事情，这样的好事只怕我们作得太少了。
    为了继承以往话剧运动的经验，为了丰富我们上演剧目的内容，话剧团也不妨适当选择“五四”以来具有革命民主主义内容的优良剧本以及适合我国观众口味的外国古典名剧。只要这些剧目选择得适当，辅之以正当的宣传评介工作，它们只会帮助丰富我国劳动人民的精神生活，而不会有什么害处。
    采取上面所说的各种办法来丰富我们的上演剧目，这个道理已经逐渐为戏剧界所接受，可是实行起来却总有很多困难。主要的障碍是：我们的话剧团没有建立正常的剧目上演制度，没有建设自己的保留剧目，没有定期地向群众宣布成批的剧目的习惯，没有向我国的戏曲团体和外国的话剧院学习积累上演剧目及保持经常演出的经验。我们的话剧团既然不经常演出，而是一年中偶尔有一两次演出，观众当然有充分理由要求剧目表现的题材是最现实最尖锐的，思想性艺术性都是很高的，表演艺术是头等的。剧团越不经常演出，每一次演出就越带着重新开张的性质，观众对它的期待就越高。同时，演员既然不经常演出，在舞台上锻炼的机会很少，演技就越是难以提高，演出的结果就越是容易使观众失望。要改变这种状况，剧团必须逐步积累自己的保留节目。凡是上演中曾经受到观众欢迎、今后还可受到观众欢迎的剧目，绝不能轻易抛掉，而要精益求精地在舞台上继续磨炼它。剧院应该试验着向观众预告今后半年内或一年内准备轮番演出的成批剧目，其中可以包括新创作的剧本、翻译的剧本、改编的剧本、“五四”以来的优良剧本；有描写当前现实斗争题材的剧本，也有虽然是历史题材或外国题材，但以其现实主义鼓舞人心的力量同样在群众精神生活上产生积极作用的剧本，这样来锻炼演员多方面的表现能力，满足群众多方面的兴趣和要求。每一个剧目不是一演几个月然后“弃若敝屣”，而是若干剧目定期的轮番演出，这样来保持剧场的经常演出，保持剧团和群众的经常联系，免得老是冷一阵热一阵，使观众很难记得剧团和演员的名字，很难培养起经常到话剧场看戏的习惯。
    必须有了经常的演出，才能为表演艺术的提高、各种剧场艺术的提高创造条件。
    要提高表演艺术，根本的问题是演员们必须建立刻苦学习的习惯。表演艺术是一种非常复杂和困难的艺术，演员需要学习的东西太多了。演员必须系统地学习马克思列宁主义和社会主义现实主义的艺术理论，以提高自己对社会生活、对艺术作品的观察分析能力。必须提高自己的政治品质与道德品质，以发挥舞台艺术的战斗性，并保证在表演英雄人物时不致歪曲了他们的精神。演员必须经常向生活学习，经常留心观察社会生活和各式各样的人物及其心理，积累丰富的感性知识，使他的艺术创造有所根据。必须经常阅读文学作品，以提高自己的文学修养。必须经常从事表演艺术技巧的锻炼以至身体的训练、朗诵与念词等基本训练。总之，他要学习的东西是很多的，而这些东西又是缺一不可的。他如果不善于掌握时间，建立起刻苦学习、独立研究和坚持不懈的习惯，而只是依靠一点小聪明，依靠一点道听途说的学习，或者单纯依赖上级的培养，那是无论如何也不能成为一个好演员的。可是在我们的演员生活中，自由散漫、崇尚清谈、空发牢骚，甚至言不及义的现象还是没有完全根绝的。在我们的演员生活中，需要普遍树立起刻苦学习的新风气。
    史坦尼斯拉夫斯基演剧体系的研究学习，如何和我们的演剧活动实践相结合，这是当前的一个最迫切的课题。对表演艺术理论的翻译介绍，固然还需要更有计划地进行，但目前更需要把科学的演剧理论，在演员中进行广泛的普及工作。目前需要适合我国演员水平的深入浅出的著作，需要根据我国的演剧经验、演出实例来阐发史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的理论原则，使它容易为普通演员所了解和掌握。同时，话剧演员也应当经常向我国优秀的戏曲演员学习，经常看戏曲演出，和戏曲演员交朋友；不是从形式上模仿他们的表演，而是吸取他们现实主义表现方法的神髓；例如他们的典型化的能力、强调夸张的能力、细致而简练的表现能力、动作的稳定感雕塑感、掌握语言的能力以及掌握观众情绪的能力。我们经常地向戏曲演员学习，这对于使话剧艺术进一步地取得民族风格，进一步地适合我国观众的口味和欣赏习惯，都会有很大的好处。
