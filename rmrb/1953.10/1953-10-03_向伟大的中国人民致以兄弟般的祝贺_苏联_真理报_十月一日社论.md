    Brotherly Congratulations to the Great Chinese People
    —Soviet "Pravda" Editorial, October 1st
    On October 1st, the great Chinese people celebrate the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Soviet people and all progressive humanity also joyfully celebrate this day, which is of great significance in the lives of the Chinese people.
    The telegram from Comrade G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, to Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, published today, states: "The Soviet people warmly congratulate the great Chinese people on their new achievements in realizing the national industrialization plan, developing agriculture, improving the people's welfare, and further consolidating their people's democratic state. For the welfare of our two peoples, and for the consolidation of world peace and international security, may the unbreakable brotherly friendship and close cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China grow and develop day by day!” This deep feeling of all Soviet people is also expressed in the telegram from Comrade V.M. Molotov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, to Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, also published today.
    After the Great October Socialist Revolution and the Soviet victory over Hitler fascism, the Chinese People's Revolution is the most important and prominent event in world history. With the establishment of the People's Republic of China, this great country, which had long suffered from the ruthless plunder and exploitation of American, Japanese, and European imperialists, permanently broke away from the capitalist system. The Asia of the past, subjected to the dark oppression and national enslavement of foreign forces, has become a thing of the past forever. No one can stop or hinder this great tide of resurgence of the peoples of the East, which has become one of the most important characteristics of our time, opening up encouraging prospects for the further development of modern civilization as a whole. From the all-round progress of the People's Republic of China, the people of the colonial and dependent countries of the East see a clear example of how great achievements the people who control their own destiny can make.
    Over the past four years, the People's Republic of China has shown the world its great vitality and strength, successfully implementing historical reforms at home and ensuring the economic and cultural upsurge and improvement of the material conditions of the masses. Under the leadership of its glorious Communist Party, the Chinese people are victoriously building a new life. The historical achievement of the Chinese people is the firm alliance of workers and peasants. One of the main and most difficult tasks of the people's revolution—land reform—has been realized. China's industry is developing rapidly. This year, the Chinese people have enthusiastically embarked on the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan. The basic task of this plan is to concentrate the main forces on developing heavy industry, establishing the foundation for national industrialization and further consolidating national defense, training skilled cadres for economic construction, developing transportation, light industry, and agriculture, expanding commerce, and systematically promoting the collectivization of agriculture and handicrafts. The restoration and growth of the economy, and the increase in labor productivity, have enabled the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government to increase the material welfare of the working people and develop culture year by year.
    The all-round progress of the People's Republic of China is a source of great satisfaction and pride to all progressive humanity. No force in the world can stop the Chinese people from moving forward towards national development and the prosperity of their motherland. The People's Republic of China has become such an international force that it does not allow the imperialists to arbitrarily enslave the Asian people or allow them to implement policies aimed at turning Asia into a hotbed of a new world war as they please. Only those who intentionally want to artificially complicate the situation in the East would disregard the great Chinese people and place their bets on anti-people scum like the Chiang Kai-shek clique. This policy is short-sighted. Because people cannot ignore the fundamental changes that have taken place in Asia and the Pacific region, changes that have left their mark on the post-war lives of more than one billion people in this region.
    In our time, international problems in the East, Asia, and the world cannot be solved without the participation of the People's China. The Korean event proves that the Chinese people have become a strong fortress in the struggle of the oppressed people of the East for freedom and independence. The immortal achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteers prove that the unity of the Asian peoples is unbreakable. This is a sign of a new era beginning in the East, a sign of the determination of the Asian people to fight for and safeguard national freedom and independence, and not to allow Asia to become a hotbed of a new world war.
    The current objective conditions enable the progressive social forces in the East in our time to turn Asia into a fortress of peace. One of the most important of these objective conditions is the international prestige of the People's Republic of China and its policies. The People's Republic of China today appears as a strong and stable factor in Asia and the Pacific region. The People's Republic of China is a new major power, and together with all peace-loving forces, it is working together to consolidate peace and international security. It is futile for the forces of aggression to try to implement a policy that challenges the historically significant progress of all peoples. The attempt by the imperialist bloc to isolate the People's Republic of China is merely a reactionary and unrealizable dream. The plans of the imperialist countries to prevent the People's Republic of China from participating in the United Nations are bound to fail, just as their plans to strangle the People's China by means of economic blockade have failed.
    The great victories of the Chinese people in economic construction and on the international stage are a huge contribution to easing international tensions and consolidating the cause of peace. All these victories are inseparable from the extensive and selfless brotherly assistance of the Soviet Union to the People's China. The Soviet assistance is based on the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and is based on the common desire of the two major countries for peace and cooperation. It demonstrates a new and equal relationship that is impossible under the capitalist system, a relationship unique to the countries of the invincible democratic socialist camp. The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have established an extensive system of economic and cultural ties between the two sides. The Soviet Union granted the People's Republic of China long-term loans on favorable terms, and returned the Chinese Changchun Railway and all its property jointly managed by the Soviet Union and China free of charge. The Soviet Union has provided the Chinese people with an inexhaustible wealth of experience in socialist construction.
    The recent talks between the Soviet government and the delegation of the government of the People's Republic of China were a new and clear manifestation of the growing and strengthening friendship between the Soviet Union and China. As a result of the talks, the Soviet government agreed to provide China with systematic economic and technical assistance in the construction and reconstruction of 91 new enterprises in China and 50 enterprises that are currently under construction and reconstruction. As pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, this is of extremely great significance for China's industrialization, for China's gradual transition to socialism, and for strengthening the forces of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    The unbreakable friendship between the peace-loving Soviet Union and the peace-loving People's Republic of China is a strong fortress of peace. This friendship is supported by the people of all countries, who consider it one of the most important conditions for consolidating and guaranteeing world peace. On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet people extend warm brotherly congratulations to the great Chinese people!

    向伟大的中国人民致以兄弟般的祝贺
    ——苏联“真理报”十月一日社论
    十月一日，伟大的中国人民庆祝中华人民共和国成立四周年。苏联人民和全体进步人类也欢欣鼓舞地庆祝这个在中国人民生活中意义重大的日子。
    今天公布的苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫同志致中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东同志的贺电说：“苏联人民热烈地祝贺伟大的中国人民在实现国家工业化计划、在发展农业和提高人民福利、在进一步全力巩固自己的人民民主国家的事业中获得新的成就。为我们两国人民的福利，为巩固世界和平与国际安全，愿苏联和中华人民共和国之间牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊与紧密合作日益增长与发展！”全体苏联人民的这种深厚的感情还表现在今天公布的苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫同志致中华人民共和国政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来同志的贺电中。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命和苏联战胜希特勒法西斯以后，中国人民革命是全世界历史中最重要和最突出的事件。由于中华人民共和国的成立，这个长期受着美国、日本和欧洲帝国主义者无情掠夺和剥削的大国，永久摆脱了资本主义体系。过去，亚洲的命运是受到外国势力暗无天日的压迫和民族奴役，但这样的亚洲已经永远成为过去了。任何人也不能制止和阻挠东方各国人民的这一伟大的复兴的潮流，这一潮流已成为我们这个时代最重要的特征之一，它为整个现代文明的进一步发展开辟了令人鼓舞的前景。东方殖民地和附属国的人民从中华人民共和国各方面的进步中看到了一个鲜明的榜样：把命运掌握在自己手中的人民能够作出多么伟大的事业。
    过去四年以来，中华人民共和国向全世界显示出它的伟大的生命力和强固性，它正在顺利地实现着国内历史性的改革，并保证着人民群众经济、文化的高涨和物质状况的改善。中国人民在自己光荣的共产党领导下，胜利地建设着新的生活。中国人民的历史成果是工人和农民牢固的联盟。人民革命主要的和最艰难的任务之一——土地改革已经实现了。中国的工业迅速发展着。中国人民今年热情高涨地着手执行第一个五年计划。这个计划的基本任务是：集中主要力量发展重工业，建立国家工业化和进一步巩固国防力量的基础，培养经济建设的熟练干部，发展交通运输业、轻工业和农业，扩大商业，有步骤地促进农业和手工业的合作化。经济的恢复和成长，劳动生产率的提高使得中国共产党和人民政府能够一年年地增进劳动人民的物质福利，发展文化。
    中华人民共和国各方面的进步使全体进步人类十分满意并引为骄傲。世界上没有一种力量可以阻止中国人民走向民族发展、祖国繁荣昌盛的前进脚步。中华人民共和国已成为这样一种国际力量：它不让帝国主义者任意地奴役亚洲人民，不让他们为所欲为地执行旨在变亚洲为新世界大战温床的政策。只有那些有意要人为地使东方形势复杂化的人们，才会轻视伟大的中国人民，而把赌注押在像蒋介石集团这样的反人民的渣滓上。这种政策是短视的政策。因为人们不能无视在亚洲及太平洋区域已经发生的根本变化，这一变化在这个地区十亿以上人口的战后生活上打下了烙印。
    在我们的时代，东方、亚洲和全世界的国际问题没有人民中国的参加，是解决不了的。朝鲜事件证明，中国人民已成为东方被压迫人民争取自由与独立的斗争中的强大堡垒。中国人民志愿军的不朽功绩证明亚洲各国人民的团结是牢不可破的。这是在东方开始的新纪元的标志，这是亚洲人民争取并维护民族自由和独立、不让亚洲成为新世界大战的温床的决心的标志。
    目前的客观条件使东方的进步社会力量在我们的时代可以把亚洲变成和平堡垒。这些客观条件中最重要的一个条件是中华人民共和国的国际威望和它的政策。中华人民共和国今天以一个强大的稳定因素出现在亚洲和太平洋区域。中华人民共和国是一个新的大国，它跟一切爱好和平的力量在一起，共同为巩固和平和国际安全而努力。侵略力量力图实行一种向各国人民的具有历史意义的进步挑战的政策，这是枉费心机的。帝国主义集团企图孤立中华人民共和国，只是一种反动的、不可实现的梦想而已。帝国主义国家不让中华人民共和国参加联合国的计划一定要遭到不可避免的破产，正像他们想用经济封锁的办法扼杀人民中国的计划遭到了破产一样。
    中国人民在经济建设和在国际舞台上的伟大胜利是对缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平事业的巨大贡献。所有这一切胜利是和苏联对人民中国的广泛、无私的兄弟帮助分不开的。苏联的帮助是根据友好同盟互助条约，是根据两大国对和平和合作的共同愿望，它表现出一种新的、在资本主义制度下不可能有的平等关系，这种关系是不可战胜的民主社会主义阵营各国所特有的。苏联和中华人民共和国建立了双方经济和文化联系的广泛体系。苏联给予中华人民共和国以条件优惠的长期贷款，无偿地交还苏中共管的中国长春铁路及其一切财产。苏联向中国人民提供了取之不尽、用之不竭的社会主义建设的丰富经验。
    不久以前苏联政府和中华人民共和国政府代表团之间举行的商谈，是苏中两国友谊日益成长、日益加强的新的明显的表现。商谈结果，苏联政府同意建设和改建中国的九十一个新的企业以及正在建设和改建的五十个企业中给中国以系统的经济的和技术的援助。如中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东同志所指出，这对于中国工业化、使中国逐步过渡到社会主义和壮大以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，都具有极其重大的作用。
    爱好和平的苏联和爱好和平的中华人民共和国的牢不可破的友谊是强大的和平堡垒。这种友谊得到各国人民的拥护，他们认为这是巩固和保证世界和平的头等重要条件之一。在中华人民共和国建国四周年的日子里，苏联人民向伟大的中国人民致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺！
