Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: TASS, New York, October 27th: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the so-called "Impartial Investigation of Accusations Regarding the Use of Bacteriological Weapons by United Nations Forces." This issue was insisted upon by the American representative to be included on the agenda of the General Assembly, as he attempted to mislead world public opinion with the deceit of an "impartial investigation" in order to cover up the fact that the United States used bacteriological weapons in the Korean War.

The American representative spoke first, groundlessly denying the fact that American forces had used bacteriological weapons in Korea. In his speech, he made unwarranted slanders against the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Soviet Union.

Soviet representative Malik pointed out in his speech that the United States has consistently opposed objective and comprehensive reviews by United Nations bodies of the issue of the use of bacteriological weapons by American forces in Korea. Malik said that the Soviet delegation insisted from the beginning that representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea be invited to participate in the discussion of this issue. However, the United States rejected this proposal. The United States used all means at its disposal to prevent representatives of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from participating in the review of this issue. Due to the actions taken by the American representative and the delegations that supported them, this issue was placed on the agenda of the Seventh General Assembly of the United Nations and discussed without the participation of representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This was a violation of the United Nations Charter, because the United Nations Charter stipulates that all parties concerned should be invited to participate in the review of such issues. The United States not only evaded an objective and comprehensive discussion of this issue, but also demanded that the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea allow people designated by the United States and its supporters in the United Nations to conduct a so-called "investigation" on Chinese and Korean territory.

Malik pointed out that after the failure of its unilateral and illegal actions, the United States is now attempting to deny the confessions made by American pilots captured in Korea that American forces used bacteriological weapons. The Soviet representative analyzed the statements made by the released American pilots and compared these statements with the confessions made by the American pilots while captured in Korea. He pointed out that the attempt to deny the confessions made by the captured personnel in Korea is completely unfounded and exposed the inhuman methods used by the American army in the war. Malik said that the attempt to deny the confessions of former captured American officers is to achieve the following political goals: to defend the US military command in the face of world public opinion, and to deny the various cruel and inhumane warfare methods used by the American army in the three-year Korean War, such as the indiscriminate slaughter of peaceful residents, regardless of men, women, old, or young, the barbaric bombardment of Korean cities and villages from the sea and air, and the burning of cities and villages with napalm bombs. However, no conspiracy or trickery can make the Korean, Chinese, and all Asian countries, and hundreds of millions of people in all countries of the world forget the inhuman and barbaric war waged by foreign aggressors against the peace-loving Korean people.

After exposing the American representative's slander against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Malik said that the task of the United Nations General Assembly is not to study the propaganda carried out by the United States for the purpose of achieving certain political goals. The current task of the General Assembly is to require all those countries that have not yet signed or ratified the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which stipulates the prohibition of bacteriological weapons, to sign or ratify this protocol in the shortest possible time. There is no doubt that this protocol has played a major role in the history of diplomatic relations in the past twenty-five years. Even the most aggressive countries cannot but recognize that this protocol prohibiting the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons in war contains significant international political, legal, and moral significance. A total of forty-eight countries, the majority of countries in the world, have signed or subsequently acceded to the Geneva Protocol. The vast majority of the countries that have signed or subsequently acceded to the Geneva Protocol have ratified the protocol, with only a very few six countries, including the United States, not having ratified it to this day.

The Soviet representative finally put forward the following proposal: "The United Nations General Assembly calls upon all countries that have not participated in the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, on the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons, or that have not ratified this protocol, to participate in or ratify this protocol."

    美国在联大政委会上妄图否认前美国被俘飞行人员的供词
    马立克揭穿美国抵赖细菌战阴谋
    并要求未批准日内瓦议定书的国家尽速加以批准
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：联合国大会政治委员会昨天下午举行会议，讨论所谓“公正调查关于联合国军队使用细菌武器的控诉”。这个问题是美国代表坚持要求列入大会议程的，他企图以“公正调查”的谰言，迷惑世界舆论，掩盖美国在侵朝战争中使用细菌武器的事实。
    美国代表首先发言，他毫无根据地否认美国军队曾在朝鲜使用细菌武器这一事实。他在演说中对中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和苏联横加污蔑。
    苏联代表马立克在发言中指出：美国一贯反对联合国机构对美国军队在朝鲜使用细菌武器的问题进行客观的和全面的审查。马立克说，苏联代表团一开始就坚持主张邀请中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的代表参加讨论这个问题。可是美国否决了这个建议。美国利用了它所有的一切手段阻止中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加审查这个问题。由于美国代表以及支持他们的代表团采取这种行为，这个问题就在没有中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加的情况下，被列入了联合国第七届大会的议程并进行了讨论。这样做是违反联合国宪章的，因为，联合国宪章规定审查这一类问题时应邀请各有关方面参加。美国不但逃避对这个问题进行客观的、全面的讨论，而且还要求中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府允许美国和它在联合国中的拥护者所指定的人到中国和朝鲜领土上去进行所谓“调查”。
    马立克指出：美国在它的片面的、非法的行动遭到失败后，现在又企图否认美国飞行人员在朝鲜被俘时供认美国军队使用细菌武器的供词。苏联代表对美国被俘飞行人员被释放后所作的声明作了分析，并把这些声明和美国飞行人员在朝鲜被俘时所作的供词作了对比。他指出，企图否认被俘人员在朝鲜所作的供词，是完全没有根据的，并揭露美国军队在战争中使用的灭绝人性的方法。马立克说，企图否认前被俘美国军官的供词，是为了达到以下的政治目的：要在世界舆论面前为美军司令部辩护，否认美国军队在三年的侵朝战争中所使用的各种残酷的、灭绝人性的战争方法，如：不分男女老幼地对和平居民滥肆屠杀，从海上和空中对朝鲜的城市和乡村进行野蛮的轰击，并用凝固汽油弹烧毁城市和乡村。但是，任何阴谋诡计，都不能使朝鲜、中国以及亚洲所有国家和世界各国亿万人民忘记外国侵略者对爱好和平的朝鲜人民所进行的灭绝人性的野蛮的战争。
    马立克在揭露了美国代表对苏联、中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的污蔑之后说道：联合国大会的任务并不是要去研究美国的这种为了达到某种政治目的而进行的宣传。目前大会的任务是要求所有那些还没有在规定禁用细菌武器的一九二五年日内瓦议定书上签字或没有批准这个议定书的国家，在尽可能短的时期内在这个议定书上签字或批准这个议定书。毫无疑问，这一议定书在最近二十五年的外交关系史上起了很大的作用。甚至最富有侵略性的国家也不能不承认，这个禁止在战争中使用化学武器和细菌武器的议定书含有重大的国际政治意义、法律意义和道德意义。在日内瓦议定书上签字或后来参加这个议定书的共有四十八个国家，即世界上大多数的国家。在日内瓦议定书上签字或后来参加的国家中绝大部分的国家都批准了这一议定书，只有极少数的六个国家，其中包括美国，直到现在还没有批准这一议定书。
    苏联代表最后提出下列提案：“联合国大会号召一切没有参加一九二五年六月十七日所签订的关于禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的或是没有批准这一议定书的国家，参加或批准这一议定书。”
