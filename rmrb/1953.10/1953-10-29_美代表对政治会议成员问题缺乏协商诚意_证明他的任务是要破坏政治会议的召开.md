Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 28th. (By our special correspondent, Jiang Nan) At the third day's meeting of the bilateral talks on the political conference issue, the representatives of the Korean and Chinese governments questioned the US government representative: What reasons do you have for opposing neutral countries participating in the political conference? What basis do you have for saying that "if we invite neutral countries to participate, the political conference will be turned into an endless debate"?

The US government representative, Arthur Dean, could not answer. He digressed and repeated the slanderous phrases habitually used in American propaganda, defaming the Soviet Union and Korea and China, insisting that the Soviet Union was not a neutral country. However, the United Nations General Assembly, at its 430th meeting, passed a resolution with an absolute majority vote inviting the neutral country of the Soviet Union, which was not one of the belligerent parties, to participate in the political conference. The US representative's malicious slander once again demonstrated America's lack of sincerity in consultation, and that it was not prepared to resolve the issue to facilitate the swift convening of the political conference.

Although Dean boasted at the bilateral talks on the 26th that he would work with a "constructive attitude," the facts prove that his task is actually to sabotage the convening of the political conference. Before the talks began, Dean claimed that he had no authority to discuss the composition of the political conference, attempting to use this argument to reject the demand from the Korean and Chinese side to discuss this issue.

After the talks began, Dean desperately distorted the facts to find excuses for his refusal to discuss the composition of the political conference. At the meeting on the 27th, Dean insisted that the notification from the Korean and Chinese governments to the US government only mentioned the issue of members after mentioning the time and place of the political conference. He deliberately omitted the sentence "the more important thing in this talk is to solve the issue of the members of the political conference" from the notification. After the meeting on the 27th, he slandered the Asian neutral countries proposed by the Korean and Chinese side as not being "truly neutral countries," and believed that only Latin American countries, which were obedient to the United States, were "truly neutral countries."

Dean's attempt to sabotage the political conference is particularly evident in the threats of resuming the war that he has repeatedly issued. At the first meeting on the 26th, after shifting the responsibility for delaying the political conference to the Korean and Chinese side, Dean declared: "We hope to move the Korean issue from the battlefield to the conference table, but further delays may destroy this hope." On the 28th, Dean told reporters outside the conference room that if the Korean and Chinese side did not show signs of compromise, then "the United Nations believes that the Communists are heading down a dangerous path that may cause the war to break out again." Dean's threatening words fully demonstrate his insincere attitude towards consultation, which is the only reason why an agreement on the agenda of the talks has still not been reached.

As in the past two days, after repeating the unreasonable claim of refusing neutral countries to participate in the political conference, the US government representative suggested adjourning the meeting until 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

    美代表对政治会议成员问题缺乏协商诚意
    证明他的任务是要破坏政治会议的召开
    【新华社开城二十八日电】本社特派记者江南报道：在关于政治会议问题的双方会谈的第三天会议上，朝中两国政府代表质问美国政府代表：你方究竟有甚么理由反对中立国家参加政治会议？你方究竟有甚么根据说“假如我们邀请中立国家参加，政治会议会被变成一个无休止的辩论会”？
    美国政府代表阿瑟·迪安回答不出，他离题千里地重复美国宣传所惯于使用的诬蔑性词句，诽谤苏联和朝中两国，硬说苏联不是中立国家。然而，联合国大会第四三零次会议就是以绝对多数票通过邀请并非交战双方之一的中立国苏联参加政治会议的。美国代表的恶意诽谤，又一次表明美国缺乏协商的诚意，不是准备来解决问题以利于政治会议的迅速召开的。
    迪安在二十六日的双方会谈中，虽然扬言要用一种“建设性的态度”来进行工作，但是事实证明他的任务实际上是要破坏政治会议的召开。在会谈开始之前，迪安就声称他无权讨论政治会议的组成问题，企图用这种说法来拒绝朝中方面讨论这个问题的要求。
    在会谈开始之后，迪安又拼命歪曲事实，来为自己拒绝讨论政治会议组成问题找藉口。在二十七日会议上，迪安硬说朝中两国政府给美国政府的通知中只是在提到政治会议的时间和地点问题以后，才提到成员问题，他故意不提通知中“在这一会谈中更主要的还是应当解决政治会议的成员问题”这一句话。在二十七日会议以后，他又诬蔑朝中方面提出的亚洲中立国家不是“真正中立的国家”，而认为只有对美国唯命是从的拉丁美洲国家之类才是
    “真正的中立国家”。
    迪安这种破坏政治会议的企图，特别明显地表现在他接连发出的恢复战争的恫吓中间。在二十六日第一次会谈中，迪安在把拖延政治会议的责任推在朝中方面身上以后宣称：“我们希望把朝鲜问题从战场上转移到会议桌上来，但是再拖延下去，也许就会破坏了这种希望。”二十八日，迪安在会议室外对记者谈话时声称，如果朝中方面没有让步的表示的话，那末，“联合国方面认为共产党正走在可能使战争重新爆发的危险道路上”。迪安的这种威胁性的言词，充分说明他缺乏诚意协商的态度，这就是使会谈的议程仍然无法达成协议的唯一原因。
    正如过去两天中一样，美国政府代表在重复拒绝中立国家参加政治会议的无理主张之后，建议休会到明天上午十一时。
