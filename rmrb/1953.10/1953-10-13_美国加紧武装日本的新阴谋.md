U.S. Intensifies New Conspiracy to Arm Japan
Cui Qi

Since the cessation of hostilities in Korea, the United States has been attempting to arm Japan on an even larger scale, in order to use it as a center for intensifying its aggressive activities in the Far East and establishing a Pacific aggression organization.

In August, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and Senator Nolan "visited" Japan one after another, using massive amounts of "U.S. Aid" as a means to drive the Yoshida reactionary government to accelerate the expansion of the Japanese army and enhance its military potential. On September 3rd, Dulles again ordered the Japanese government to "take more forceful measures" to rearm. At the same time, negotiations on the so-called U.S.-Japan "Mutual Security Assistance Agreement," which had been hidden behind the scenes, were also openly stepped up.

According to recent reports in the Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun," under this "Assistance Agreement," the United States will give Japan $634 million in aid for Japan's "international construction program." Japan will also receive $120 million in military orders from the United States in the next fiscal year. It is obvious to all that this "Assistance Agreement" is entirely military in nature. However, Yoshida recently shamelessly said: "Japan's weakness is that without U.S. aid, Japan's economy cannot be established." He attempted to conceal the truth about "U.S. Aid" from the Japanese people who are angrily opposed to it. This is, of course, a futile effort. Due to the exposure and questioning by broad public opinion in Japan, even Vice Foreign Minister Okumura Katsuzo of the Yoshida government had to admit: "The aid from the Mutual Security Agency will undoubtedly be centered on military aid."

The Japanese people know what will come with military "U.S. Aid." Isn't the situation of Western European countries that were Marshallized, gasping under the burden of expanding armaments, still fresh in their minds? Moreover, Japan is already under the U.S. military occupation system. The so-called "U.S. Aid" is nothing more than Japan serving U.S. war preparations and aggression policies even further. Japanese Foreign Minister Katsuo Okazaki admitted that after accepting "aid" from the U.S. Mutual Security Agency, Japan would have the "obligation" to help the United States carry out aggressive wars.

Needless to say, accepting "U.S. Aid" will inevitably make Japan even more subservient and humiliating. Japanese Communist Party Senator Goro Suto exposed the treasonous nature of this "Assistance Agreement" in the Senate: The United States, using the "Assistance Agreement," will more directly grasp the training, equipment, and command of the Japanese army, supervise Japan's arms production, intensify its control over Japan's economy, and interfere in the Japanese people's political life and suppress Japan's peaceful and democratic movements.

Obviously, the sinister conspiracy of the United States to intensify the arming of Japan while intensifying its control over Japan through "Aid" cannot be hidden. Dulles, fearing the strong opposition of the Japanese people, used various despicable means of deception. On the one hand, he announced that the U.S. would "return" Amami Oshima, which it had seized under the separate peace treaty with Japan, in an attempt to win over the hearts of the Japanese people; on the other hand, he repeatedly said that when Japan builds its own army, the U.S. army will "withdraw as soon as possible" from Japan. However, Dulles' lies are self-defeating. The Japanese people see that today it is not the United States "returning" Japanese territory, but rather the United States is turning the entire Japanese territory into U.S. military bases. Hasn't the U.S. military in Japan already directly occupied 310 million tsubo (approximately 25,500 acres) of Japanese land and many seaports, and is still continuing to occupy them endlessly?

Not only that, but the United States is also attempting to further utilize Japan's industrial production and labor force to turn Japan into the Far East arsenal for the U.S. plan to realize "Asians fighting Asians." Recently, U.S. government officials have stated without concealment that Japan, after receiving "aid" from the U.S. Mutual Security Agency, will become the "main country" supplying Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, and South Korea with arms.

People know that after the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, it not only used Japan as a military base but also forced the Japanese economy onto a militarized track. According to recent materials published by the Japanese Economic Deliberation Agency, the total value of "special procurement" orders placed by the United States in Japan over the past three years reached $1,136,900,000. This large amount of orders greatly stimulated the expansion of military industry, severely hindered the development of a peaceful economy, and deepened Japan's economic crisis. According to 1952 statistics, heavy industry, the foundation of military industry, accounted for as much as 72.4 percent of the total production of manufacturing industries in Japan, exceeding the pre-war level (1934-1936) of militarist Japan by 13.4 percent. However, the proportion of the textile industry, a major sector of light industry, decreased from 23 percent before the war to 12 percent.

It is not difficult to understand why the ceasefire in the Korean War caused a huge shock in the Japanese economic world. As early as June, United Press reported that Japanese monopoly capitalists were "worried about the impact that the reduction in U.S. special procurement orders would have on the Japanese economy." Thereupon, Dulles wrote a letter to the Japan "Kansai Special Procurement Cooperation Association," stating that the United States "is now working hard to formulate a (military) order plan with the longest possible duration" to stabilize the mood of Japanese monopoly capitalists to continue arms production. At the same time, according to Kyodo News, the vast majority of the $200 million in U.S. aid to South Korea is also stipulated to be used to purchase arms from Japan. These facts seem to show the United States' "utmost concern" for the Japanese economy, but in reality, it is an attempt by the United States to take the opportunity to further push the Japanese economy into the abyss of militarization, intensify its manipulation of Japan's finances and foreign trade, and more cruelly plunder the Japanese people. There is no doubt that the signing of the so-called "Mutual Security Assistance Agreement" will become a new tool for the United States to realize these conspiracies and tricks, and another heavy yoke placed on the broad masses of the Japanese people.

However, the Yoshida traitorous government of Japan, disregarding the Japanese people's desire for peace and the future of the Japanese nation, is engaging in new collusion with the United States, attempting to accept this sinful "U.S. Aid" in order to continue to implement the U.S. policy of war preparations, stabilize its increasingly shaky reactionary rule, and more actively seek opportunities for the resurgence of Japanese militarist forces.

In order to meet the demands of the United States and curry favor in order to obtain more "U.S. Aid," Japanese reactionary forces are stepping up their activities. Yoshida Shigeru and the President of the Progressive Party, Class A war criminal Shigemitsu Mamoru, have reached a "understanding" on some issues concerning rearmament. The Yoshida government is discussing revising the "nature and mission" of the "Security Forces" and is attempting to restore conscription. Secretary-General Sato of the Liberal Party shouted arrogantly: Japan should "advance vigorously toward the future of strengthening its self-defense forces!" According to the September 7th issue of the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun," the Yoshida government has formulated a five-year plan for military expansion, stipulating that next year the current 110,000-strong Japanese disguised army, the "Security Forces," will be expanded to 150,000. By the end of the fifth year, the number of Japanese army personnel will be expanded to 210,000, the total tonnage of naval vessels will be increased to 145,000 tons, and an air force with 1,400 aircraft will be established. It must be pointed out here that Japan's current "Security Forces" are already the core force of a regular army. It is mainly composed of officers and non-commissioned officers, and can be expanded into a huge army in a short period of time. Therefore, expanding this core force to 210,000 is obviously a very large number. People know that the standing army of Japan before its full-scale invasion of China in 1937 was only 280,000.

The Yoshida government's reactionary policy is obviously mainly in the service of the interests of Japanese arms monopoly capitalists. As early as May 12th, the Japanese "Economic Organizations Federation," "Japan Federation of Employers' Associations," and other organizations of Japanese monopoly capitalists jointly issued "Opinions on Basic Economic Policy," openly advocating the expansion of arms production and considering it to be "the last trump card for overcoming the crisis."

After the "U.S. Aid" negotiations began, they became even more arrogant, because they believed that "the realization of their dream of making Japan an arsenal of Asia would not be far off" (Reuters). These monopoly capitalists even urged the Yoshida government to send a military industry inspection group to the United States in order to "improve the production level of the military industry" (Kyodo News). At the same time, the Japanese "Economic Organizations Federation" put forward a six-year military expansion plan that was even more arrogant than the Yoshida government's five-year military expansion plan, to expand the army to 300,000. According to a conservative estimate by the Japanese magazine "Economist," at least 4 trillion yen, or about 11.1 billion US dollars, would be required to implement this six-year military expansion plan. However, the budget expenditure of the Japanese government this year, which has already reached the largest figure, is only 960 billion yen.

The traitorous acts of the Japanese reactionaries have reached their peak, but their American masters are still not satisfied. When the Yoshida government submitted the five-year military expansion plan to the U.S. Embassy in Japan, the United States considered it "insufficient." Dulles demanded that Japan establish 350,000 U.S. mercenary soldiers. Similarly, although the Japanese government's direct and indirect military spending in recent years has accounted for about 70 percent of the total budget, Dulles recently scolded the Yoshida government for "spending money on other uses that are not very important for security (should be read as the U.S. aggression plan)." It is obvious that the U.S. aggressive bloc, in order to intensify the establishment of U.S. mercenary soldiers in Japan, actually wants to implement an even more barbaric policy of sucking the marrow of the Japanese people.

However, the fact in Japan today is that even under U.S. armed occupation, the forces of the Japanese people opposing rearmament are becoming increasingly strong, and they are waging an unyielding struggle to defeat the despicable plans of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries.

On June 26th, the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement, exposing the conspiracy of the United States to force Japan to step up its arms buildup through "Aid" and thus plunge the Japanese people into greater disaster, and called on the Japanese people to rise up and stop the new traitorous activities of the Yoshida reactionary group. In the Japanese "Peace Month" movement, which began on June 25th, the voices of the broad masses of the Japanese people against rearmament and U.S. military bases resounded throughout the country. On September 17th, under the auspices of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and other democratic organizations, a mass rally against the U.S. Mutual Security Agency "Aid" and defending industry was held in Tokyo. Participants resolutely expressed their determination to strengthen the Japanese people's struggle to defend peace and advocated the establishment of a peaceful economy. The people of all strata in Japan, who have suffered from the disasters of war, are uniting more widely and closely under the unified will of opposing rearmament and U.S. military occupation.

In the Japanese Diet, some bourgeois political parties also attacked the Yoshida government from different aspects. Among the Japanese bourgeoisie, in addition to a very small number of arms monopoly capitalists who rely on "special procurement" to pursue maximum profits, industrialists and businessmen, especially the vast number of small and medium-sized enterprises, have expressed dissatisfaction with accepting "U.S. Aid," because "U.S. Aid" will deepen the economic and trade crisis in Japan, further lose economic autonomy, and make it more difficult for the Japanese economy to get rid of its dependence on the United States.

It can be seen from this that the Yoshida reactionary government's policy of accelerating rearmament has caused serious political and economic crises, thus encountering more insurmountable difficulties on the road to further rearmament. The originally unstable political situation in Japan is becoming increasingly turbulent, and the crisis of the Yoshida government is deepening.

At the same time, due to the increasing demands of Japanese militarist forces to open up their own independent path of development, the U.S.'s step-by-step intensification of control over the Yoshida government will also cause the development of contradictions between the U.S. and Japan.

All of this shows that the U.S.'s aggressive plan in Japan will inevitably encounter greater obstacles and setbacks.

The conspiracy of the United States to intensify the arming of Japan is not only absolutely intolerable to the Japanese people but also to the people of Asian and Pacific countries, and it is also contrary to the wishes of the people of the world who demand further improvement of the international situation. Today, people see that in the East, the U.S. aggressive bloc is attempting to undermine the Korean armistice, obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and expand the war in Vietnam, in order to create a tense situation; the U.S.'s intensification of the arming of Japan is also an integral part of this despicable policy. The people of Asia and the world will surely raise their vigilance and rise up to stop the new aggressive conspiracies of the United States in the East.

    美国加紧武装日本的新阴谋
    崔奇
    朝鲜战争停止以后，美国正企图更大规模地武装日本，以作为美国在远东加紧进行侵略活动和建立太平洋侵略组织的重心。
    八月间，美国国务卿杜勒斯和参议员诺兰先后“访问”日本，以大量的“美援”为手段，驱使吉田反动政府加速扩大日本军队和增强军事潜力。九月三日，杜勒斯再次命令日本政府“采取更有力的措施”，重整军备。同时，过去一直隐藏在幕后的所谓美日“共同安全援助协定”的谈判，也公开地加紧进行了。
    据最近日本“每日新闻”透露，根据这个“援助协定”，美国将给日本六亿三千四百万美元的援助，以供日本进行“国际建设计划”。日本并将在下一会计年度从美国得到一亿二千万美元的军事订货。人所共见，这个“援助协定”完全是军事性质的。但是，最近吉田却恬不知耻地说：“日本的弱点是，没有美国的援助，就不能建立日本的经济”，他企图在愤怒地反对“美援”的日本人民面前掩盖“美援”的真相。这当然是枉费心机的。由于日本广大舆论的揭露和质问，连吉田政府副外务相奥村胜藏也不得不承认：“共同安全署的援助无疑地将以军事援助为中心。”
    日本人民知道，随着军事性的“美援”而来的将是什么。西欧马歇尔化国家喘息在扩张军备重担之下的景况不是历历在目吗？何况日本现在已经处于美国军事占领制度之下，所谓“美援”，那就无非是要日本更进一步地为美国的备战计划和侵略政策效劳。日本外务相冈崎胜男承认：在接受美国共同安全署的“援助”以后，日本要担负帮助美国进行侵略战争的“义务”。
    不消说，接受“美援”也必然使日本更加丧权辱国。日本共产党参议员须藤五郎曾在参议院揭露了这个“援助协定”的卖国本质：美国利用“援助协定”，将更直接地掌握日本军队的训练和装备以及指挥权，监督日本的军火生产，加紧控制日本的经济，并干涉日本人民的政治生活和镇压日本的和平民主运动。
    显然，美国利用“援助”来加紧武装日本同时又加紧控制日本的凶恶阴谋，是掩藏不住了。杜勒斯害怕日本人民的强烈反对，于是又使用了种种卑鄙的欺骗手段。他一边宣布把美国根据单独对日“和约”霸占的奄美大岛“归还”日本，企图笼络日本人心；一边又口口声声说，等到日本建立了自己的军队时，美国军队就要从日本“早日撤退”。然而，杜勒斯的谎言是不攻自破的。日本人民都看到，今天并不是美国在“归还”日本的土地，恰恰相反，美国正在把整个的日本国土变为美国的军事基地。驻日美军不是已经直接侵占了三亿一千余万坪的日本土地和许多海港，并且还在无止境地继续侵占吗？
    不仅如此。美国还企图进一步利用日本的工业生产力和劳动力，把日本变为美国实现“亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋计划的远东兵工厂。最近美国政府官员毫不掩饰地说，日本在接到美国共同安全署的“援助”后，将成为供给台湾、泰国、菲律宾、越南、南朝鲜以军火的“主要国家”。
    人们知道，美国发动侵略朝鲜的战争后，不但利用日本作为军事基地，而且迫使日本的经济转入了军事化的轨道。根据最近日本经济审议厅发表的材料，三年来美国在日本的“特需”订货总额达十一亿三千六百九十万美元。这一大笔订货大大地刺激了军事工业的膨胀，严重地阻碍了和平经济的发展，加深了日本的经济危机。据一九五二年的统计，军事工业基础的重工业在日本制造工业全部生产中所占比重高达百分之七十二点四，超过军国主义日本战前（一九三四——一九三六年）水平的百分之十三点四。但是轻工业主要部门的纤维业的比重，则由战前的百分之二十三减到百分之十二。
    这就不难理解，为什么朝鲜战争的停火引起了日本经济界的巨大震动。还在六月间，合众社报道，日本垄断资本家正为“日本的经济将因美国特需订货的减少所会受到的影响而担忧”。于是，杜勒斯曾写信给日本“关西特需协力会”，表示美国“现在正在努力制订一个期限尽可能长的（军事）定货计划”，来稳定日本垄断资本家继续进行军火生产的情绪。同时，据共同社透露，美国援助南朝鲜两亿美元的绝大部分，也规定要用来向日本购买军火。这些事实好像表现了美国对于日本经济的“关心备至”，然而，实际上是美国企图乘机进一步把日本经济推向军事化的深渊，加紧操纵日本的财政和对外贸易，并更残酷地掠夺日本人民。毫无疑问，所谓“共同安全援助协定”的签订，必将成为美国实现这些阴谋诡计的一个新工具，成为加于日本广大人民身上的又一道沉重枷锁。
    但是，日本的吉田卖国政府却悍然不顾日本人民的和平愿望和日本民族的前途，正和美国进行新勾结，企图接受这个罪恶的“美援”，以继续执行美国的备战政策，稳定自己日趋动摇的反动统治，并更积极地为日本军国主义势力谋求再起的机会。
    为了适应美国的要求，以便讨取更多的“美援”，日本反动势力正在加紧活动，吉田茂并和改进党总裁、甲级战犯重光葵在重整军备的一些问题上成立了“谅解”。吉田政府正在讨论修改“保安队”的“性质和任务”，并企图恢复征兵制。自由党干事长佐藤嚣张地叫喊：日本应该向“加强自卫力量的前途猛进！”据九月七日日本“朝日新闻”称，吉田政府已经制订了五年扩军计划，规定明年度将把现有十一万人的日本变相陆军“保安队”扩充为十五万人。到第五年底，日本陆军人数将扩充为二十一万人，海军舰艇总吨位将增加为十四万五千吨，并要建立拥有一千四百架飞机的空军。这里必须指出，日本现在的“保安队”已经是一支正规陆军的核心部队，它主要是由军官和士官组成的，可以在短期内扩编为庞大的军队。因此把这个核心部队扩充为二十一万人，显然是一个很大的数目。人们知道，一九三七年日本全面进攻中国前夕的常备陆军也不过二十八万人。
    吉田政府的这种反动政策，显然主要是为日本军火垄断资本家的利益服务的。还在五月十二日，日本垄断资本家的组织——日本“经济团体联合会”、“日本经营者团体联盟”等就联名发表了“关于基本经济政策的意见”，公然主张扩大军火生产，并认为这是“克服危机的最后一张王牌”。
    “美援”谈判开始后，他们更嚣张了，因为他们相信自己“所梦想的使日本成为亚洲兵工厂的计划的实现，就会为期不远”（路透社）。这些垄断资本家甚至督促吉田政府派遣军火工业考察团到美国，以求“提高军火工业的生产水平”（共同社）。同时，日本“经济团体联合会”更提出了比吉田政府的五年扩军计划更狂妄的六年扩军计划，要把陆军扩充为三十万人。据日本“经济学人”杂志的保守的估计，要实现这个六年扩军计划，至少需要四万亿日元，即约一百一十一亿美元。可是，已经达到最庞大数字的日本政府的今年度预算支出也只有九千六百余亿日元。
    日本反动派的这些卖国行径已经到了登峰造极的地步了，但是它的美国主子仍然感到不满足。当吉田政府把五年扩军计划提交给美国驻日大使馆时，美国认为“不够”。杜勒斯要求日本建立三十五万美国雇佣军。同样的，虽然近年来日本政府的直接和间接军费已占全部预算的百分之七十左右，但是杜勒斯最近却责骂吉田政府“把钱用在对安全（应读作美国侵略计划）不是非常重要的其他用途上”。显而易见，美国侵略集团为了加紧在日本建立美国雇佣军，竟想对日本人民实行更进一步的敲骨吸髓的野蛮政策。
    然而，今天日本的事实是，即使在美国武装占领下，日本人民反对重整军备的力量还是变得日益强大起来，他们正为了击败美日反动派的卑鄙计划，进行着不屈不挠的斗争。
    六月二十六日，日本共产党中央指导部发表声明，揭穿了美国企图利用“援助”迫使日本加紧武装从而把日本人民投入更大灾难的阴谋，并号召日本人民起来制止吉田反动集团的新的卖国活动。在从六月二十五日开始的日本“和平月”运动中，日本广大群众反对重整军备和反对美国军事基地的呼声遍及全国。九月十七日，在日本工会总评议会和其他民主团体的主持下，在东京举行了反对美国共同安全署“援助”、保卫产业的群众大会。与会者坚决表示要加强日本人民保卫和平的斗争，并主张建立和平经济。备受战争灾难的日本各阶层人民在反对重整军备和反对美军占领的统一意志下，正越来越广泛地和紧密地团结起来了。
    在日本国会里，某些资产阶级政党，也从不同的方面攻击吉田政府。在日本资产阶级中，除了极少数依靠“特需”追求最大利润的军火垄断资本家外，工商业者特别是广大的中小企业者，都对接受“美援”表示不满，因为“美援”将使日本经济与贸易危机加深，进一步丧失经济自主权，使日本经济更难于摆脱对美国的依赖。
    由此可见，吉田反动政府加紧重新武装的政策，已造成严重的政治危机和经济危机，从而使它自己在进一步重整军备的道路上遇到了更加不可克服的困难。原来就不稳定的日本政局正日益动荡，吉田政府的危机是越来越深重了。
    同时，由于日本军国主义势力日益要求开辟自己独立发展的道路，美国对吉田政府的步步加紧控制，也将造成美日之间的矛盾的发展。
    所有这些都说明，美国在日本所实行的侵略计划必将遭到更大的障碍和打击。
    美国企图加紧武装日本的阴谋，不仅是日本人民而且是亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民所绝对不能容许的，同时也是和要求进一步改善国际局势的全世界人民的愿望相违背的。现在人们看到，在东方，美国侵略集团正企图破坏朝鲜停战，阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，并扩大越南战争，来制造紧张局势；美国加紧武装日本，也正是这种可耻政策的组成部分。亚洲以及全世界人民必将提高警惕，起来制止美国在东方的新的侵略阴谋。
