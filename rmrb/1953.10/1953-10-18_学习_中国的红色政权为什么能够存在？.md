    Studying "Why Can China's Red Political Power Exist?"
    Song Shilun
    Comrade Mao Zedong's work "Why Can China's Red Political Power Exist?" was published in October 1928. This work once guided the Chinese people like a beacon, solving problems such as where the Chinese revolution should go, how to proceed, and what the future would hold. Even today, it still maintains great theoretical power. The path indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong in this work and realized by the Chinese people also has great guiding significance for the liberation struggles of the people of Eastern colonies and dependent countries. Therefore, this work is an epoch-making document and a significant contribution to Marxist-Leninist theory.
    Due to the participation and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and due to the mobilization of the broad masses of workers and peasants, the Northern Expedition against imperialism and warlords, which began in Guangzhou in July 1926, quickly achieved great victories. However, Chen Duxiu, the leader of the Communist Party at the time, committed a right-leaning opportunist error, rejected Comrade Mao Zedong's correct line, and caused this revolution to be betrayed halfway by representatives of the comprador-bourgeoisie, landlords, and gentry. On April 12, 1927, Chiang Kai-shek, the representative of the comprador-bourgeoisie, landlords, and gentry, under the instigation of imperialism, first launched a counter-revolutionary coup in Shanghai, massacring a large number of workers and Communists, and declared anti-communism. Subsequently, on April 15 of the same year, a so-called "Party Purification Movement" was launched in Guangdong, brutally massacring and arresting a large number of Communists and revolutionary workers, peasants, and intellectuals. On May 21, reactionary officer Xu Kexiang launched a counter-revolutionary coup in Changsha. Finally, on July 15 of the same year, the Kuomintang of the Wang Jingwei faction in Hankou also officially announced its break with the Communist Party and surrendered to Chiang Kai-shek. The First Revolutionary Civil War thus suffered defeat. From then on, the reactionary ruler Chiang Kai-shek implemented the bloody policy of "rather kill a thousand by mistake than let one go" throughout the country, massacring Communists and revolutionary workers, peasants, and intellectuals on a large scale, creating a nationwide counter-revolutionary white terror.
    After the failure of the 1927 revolution, "left" and right-leaning deviations occurred within the Party. As pointed out in the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History" adopted by the enlarged Seventh Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on April 20, 1945: "A small number of capitulationists represented by Chen Duxiu during the First Great Revolution were pessimistic and disappointed about the future of the revolution at this time and gradually became liquidationists. ... On the other hand, the petty-bourgeois revolutionary impatience, strengthened by hatred of the Kuomintang's massacre policy and anger at Chen Duxiu's capitulationism, was also reflected in the Party, causing 'left' leaning sentiments to develop rapidly within the Party. This 'left' leaning sentiment had already begun at the Party Central Committee's emergency meeting on August 7, 1927 ('August 7th Conference'). The 'August 7th Conference' was meritorious in the history of the Party. ... However, while opposing right-leaning errors, the 'August 7th Conference' opened the way for 'left' leaning errors. ... This 'left' leaning sentiment continued to grow after the 'August 7th Conference,' and at the enlarged meeting of the Party Central Committee in November 1927, it took the form of a 'left' leaning blind actionism (i.e., adventurism) line and made the 'left' leaning line dominate within the leading organs of the Party Central Committee for the first time. ... However, because this erroneous line initially aroused correct criticism and objections from Comrade Mao Zedong and many comrades working in the White areas, and caused many losses in actual work, the implementation of this 'left' leaning line had ceased in many places by the beginning of 1928, and by April of the same year (less than half a year after the start of the 'left' leaning line), it had basically ended in practical work throughout the country."
    After the "August 7th Conference," Comrade Mao Zedong went to eastern Hunan to organize and lead the Autumn Harvest Uprising of the peasants. In October 1927, he led the armed forces organized by the Autumn Harvest Uprising to the Jinggang Mountains, the middle section of the Luoxiao Mountains on the border between Hunan and Jiangxi. Comrade Mao Zedong did not take military actions such as going south to Chaozhou and Shantou after the Nanchang Uprising, nor did he take military actions such as establishing a government in the city after the Guangzhou Uprising. Instead, he accurately identified the special circumstances of Chinese society, the contradictions within the ruling class, and the subjective strength and mass conditions of the revolution at the time, and chose an area with a good mass base, weak reactionary ruling forces, defensible terrain, and significant political influence to create rural revolutionary base areas for armed independent regimes of workers and peasants. After arriving at the Jinggang Mountains, he did not conceal himself in silence, but resolutely and publicly fought against the enemy. That is: create a red political power to oppose escapeism; mobilize the masses to deeply carry out the land revolution; the Party in the army helps the development of the local party, and the regular Red Army helps the development of local armed forces; the expansion of the independent regime areas adopts a wave-like advancement policy, opposing the policy of rash advance; take root and build revolutionary base areas. From these specific revolutionary practices, it can be proved that Comrade Mao Zedong had already fully considered the issues of where the Chinese revolution should go and how it should be done. Under the circumstances at the time, being able to take such actions was a genius manifestation of Comrade Mao Zedong's specific application of Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese revolution. This is a creation of a revolutionary struggle type unprecedented in the history of the Chinese revolutionary movement and also in the history of the world proletarian revolutionary movement. Comrade Mao Zedong, and only Comrade Mao Zedong, using his profound Marxist-Leninist theory, through scientific and in-depth investigations and studies of Chinese society, Chinese history, the enemy's situation, and the surrounding environment, found the laws of the Chinese revolution arising from China's special circumstances. According to these laws, he personally participated in and led the practice of the revolution, broke through the atmosphere of white terror, and raised the red flag of revolution high in the Jinggang Mountains. The establishment of this red flag declared to the reactionaries that the Chinese revolution had not failed and that the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people could not be defeated. For Communists and revolutionary patriots across the country, it set a glorious example. It showed the future of the Chinese revolution, showed how the Chinese revolution should be specifically carried out correctly, specifically exposed and opposed the erroneous lines of "left" and right-leaning opportunism, and outstandingly created a brilliant example of correctly applying Marxist-Leninist theory to the cause of the Chinese revolution. Since then, the troops organized in uprisings in other places, wherever the correct leadership was implemented in these armed forces in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's line and policies, the revolutionary armed struggle there gradually developed. Conversely, without exception, they suffered painful defeats. Comrade Mao Zedong's great wisdom and courage shown in such a critical moment of the revolution fully demonstrated his profound understanding of Marxist-Leninist theory and his genius as a revolutionary leader.
    The Sixth National Congress of the Party in July 1928 thoroughly liquidated Chen Duxiu's capitulationism and also criticized the errors of "left" leaning blind actionism. Its line was basically correct. As pointed out in the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History": "It correctly affirmed that Chinese society was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, pointed out that none of the fundamental contradictions that caused modern Chinese revolution had been resolved, and therefore determined that the current stage of the Chinese revolution was still a bourgeois democratic revolution and issued the ten major programs of the democratic revolution. It correctly pointed out that the political situation at the time was between two revolutionary climaxes, pointed out the unevenness of revolutionary development, and pointed out that the Party's overall task at the time was not to attack, not to organize uprisings, but to win over the masses. It carried out a two-line struggle, criticizing right-wing Chen Duxiuism and 'left' wing blind actionism, and especially pointed out that the most important dangerous tendency within the Party was blind actionism, military adventurism, and commandism that were divorced from the masses. These were all absolutely necessary. On the other hand, the Sixth Congress also had its shortcomings and errors. It lacked correct estimates and policies regarding the two-sidedness of the intermediate classes and the internal contradictions of the reactionary forces; it also lacked necessary understanding of the orderly retreat in tactics required by the Party after the failure of the Great Revolution, the importance of rural base areas, and the long-term nature of the democratic revolution." Comrade Mao Zedong did not participate in this congress, but resolutely implemented the resolutions of the Sixth Congress. Comrade Mao Zedong developed the correct aspects of the resolutions of this congress in practice, and solved the problems that the congress had not yet solved or had not solved correctly, and in theory, he gave a more specific and more complete scientific basis to the direction of the Chinese revolution in Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Mao Zedong creatively set a brilliant example for party members in implementing the Party's resolutions.
    Comrade Mao Zedong's work was published in October 1928, that is, one year after the start of the armed independent regime of workers and peasants in the Jinggang Mountains. In this year, due to the correctness of the strategies and policies formulated by Comrade Mao Zedong, the base areas were expanded, the land revolution was deepened, and the mass base was further consolidated. Due to the victorious joining of the troops of the Nanchang Uprising led by Comrade Zhu De with Comrade Mao Zedong in the Jinggang Mountains in April 1928, the main Red Army was stronger than before, and it smashed the enemy's three encirclements in the four months from April to July. However, Du Xiujing, the representative of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, erroneously disregarded the opposition of the Border Special Committee and the Yongxin County Party Committee (the Hunan Provincial Party Committee was the superior organization of the Border Special Committee at that time), and forced the Red Army to advance rashly towards southern Hunan, causing the Red Army to suffer the defeat of August. Comrade Mao Zedong personally led a battalion of troops to meet and join the troops advancing south, and after September, he reopened the situation, restored the border area, and rescued the failure of August. The historical facts of this year have proved that if one acts in accordance with the strategies and policies instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the result will be that the independent regime areas will expand day by day, the land revolution will deepen day by day, the organization of the people's political power will be promoted day by day, and the Red Army and the Red Guards will become stronger day by day. Conversely, if one deviates from the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's strategies and policies, the result will be that the Red Army will suffer setbacks, the base areas will shrink or even be lost, and the masses will be devastated. The defeat of August is a clear and profound lesson.
    At that time, some comrades in the Party and the army still lacked a correct understanding of the estimation of the situation and the specific path of the revolution. They "did not have a deep concept of establishing a red political power in the guerrilla area, and therefore did not have a deep concept of using the consolidation and expansion of this red political power to promote the national revolutionary upsurge. They seemed to believe that doing the arduous work of establishing a political power in a period far from the revolutionary upsurge was futile" (Mao Zedong: "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire"). Some comrades, in times of difficulty and danger, even doubted the existence of such a red political power, and developed pessimistic sentiments, doubting "how long the red flag can last." Therefore, explaining in theory why the red political power can arise, exist, and develop, in order to unify the understanding within the Party and the army, clarify the specific path of the revolution, and strengthen the confidence in victory, was an urgent task. Comrade Mao Zedong opportunely engaged in this theoretical work. He scientifically analyzed the political and economic situation after the failure of the First Great Revolution, pointing out that under the rule of the Kuomintang's new warlords, "the national workers, peasants, civilians, and even the bourgeoisie are still under the anti-revolutionary rule and have not obtained the slightest political or economic liberation." He proposed that "China urgently needs a bourgeois democratic revolution, which must be led by the proletariat to be completed." He pointed out that "the content of China's democratic revolution... includes overthrowing the rule of imperialism and its tools, the warlords, in China, completing the national revolution, and implementing the land revolution, eliminating the feudal exploitation of the peasants by the landlords and gentry." Comrade Mao Zedong, using the scientific methods of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, profoundly analyzed the characteristics of Chinese society and the situation of the enemy and ourselves, and analyzed in detail the reasons for the occurrence and existence of the Chinese red political power. The five reasons he pointed out at that time provided the initial and perfect foundation for the creation of the magic weapon for revolutionary victory that was subsequently proven by long-term revolutionary practice - the problem of party building, the problem of armed struggle, and the problem of the united front. Comrade Mao Zedong realistically summarized the experience of the border area in fighting the enemy for one year, analyzed the reasons and lessons of the defeat in August, and determined a complete set of policies for building and expanding the red political power. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out the development prospect of the red political power: "The current Chinese revolutionary situation is continuing to develop forward following the continued division and war of the domestic comprador-bourgeoisie and the international bourgeoisie. Therefore, not only is there no doubt about the long-term existence of small red areas, but these red areas will continue to develop and gradually approach the acquisition of national political power." In "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," which Comrade Mao Zedong published later, he further estimated the significance of the red political power: "This is necessary in order to establish the belief of the national revolutionary masses, just as the Soviet Union did for the whole world. This is necessary in order to give the reactionary ruling class great difficulties, shake its foundation, and promote its internal disintegration. It is also necessary in order to truly create the Red Army and become the main tool of the future Great Revolution. In short, this is necessary in order to promote the revolutionary climax." Stalin said in "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism": "It is not to rely on the classes in society that are no longer developing, even if these classes are still the dominant forces at present, but to rely on the classes in society that are developing and have a bright future, even if these classes are not the dominant forces at present." (Stalin: "Problems of Leninism," Moscow Chinese Edition, page 710) He also said: "In order not to make mistakes in politics, one must look forward, not backward." (Ibid., page 711) Comrade Mao Zedong had already correctly grasped and applied this principle in 1928. At that time, although the White political power was consolidated, it was reactionary, corrupt, and decaying, and therefore could be overthrown. At that time, although a small or several small red political powers were surrounded by the White political power, they were weak, but they were progressive, newborn, and developing, and therefore their future was "approaching the acquisition of national political power." The historical facts of the past twenty-five years have fully confirmed this great prediction of Comrade Mao Zedong. How can it be just "approaching"! Today's consolidated national political power of people's democratic dictatorship is precisely the expansion on a national scale of the then tiny several small red political powers. That is to say, the victory of the Chinese revolution today cannot ignore the dynamic role of the work "Why Can China's Red Political Power Exist?" in the slightest.
    During World War II, many colonies in the East were occupied by Japanese imperialism. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the local people took advantage of the contradictions between the imperialists, persisted in the people's anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare, and trained a considerably powerful armed force. After World War II, due to the great weakening of the imperialist camp, the strength of the peace and democracy camp, and the victory of the Chinese revolution breaking through the imperialist front in the East, the increase in the liberation struggle of the colonial people, the people of the Eastern colonies, or at least some colonies, have the possibility of long-term persistence in revolutionary base areas and revolutionary political power of varying sizes, have the possibility of long-term persistence in revolutionary war of encircling the cities from the countryside, and have the possibility of gradually advancing from this to seize the cities, and even finally achieve victory in the national scope of the colony. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong's creative analysis of the laws of the Chinese revolution based on the special circumstances of China in the early stages of the Chinese revolutionary war has a wider guiding significance.
    Looking back and reviewing the situation at that time and reviewing Comrade Mao Zedong's works in that period, we can more deeply appreciate Comrade Mao Zedong's correctness and greatness.
    In studying this great work of Comrade Mao Zedong, I believe that we should better learn Comrade Mao Zedong's scientific method of observing, analyzing, and handling problems, that is, how to specifically apply the general truth of Marxism-Leninism to the practice of revolution; learn Comrade Mao Zedong's revolutionary courage, that is, how, in the most difficult circumstances, with unwavering confidence in the victory of the revolutionary cause, to calmly and realistically analyze the situation, grasp the essence of the problem, put forward specific ways to overcome difficulties, and overcome all difficulties on the road forward. Today, in the cause of national construction, we will undoubtedly encounter countless difficulties, but these difficulties are small compared with the difficulties that Comrade Mao Zedong encountered at that time. As long as we firmly follow all the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, we will be able to eliminate all obstacles on the road forward and advance bravely on the brilliant road of national economic construction and national defense construction.

    学习“中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？”
    宋时轮
    毛泽东同志的著作“中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？”，是在一九二八年十月发表的。这篇著作曾经像灯塔般地指引中国人民解决了中国革命到那里去、如何进行以及前途怎样等问题。直至今天，它仍保持着伟大的理论威力。毛泽东同志在这篇著作中所指示的并为中国人民实现的道路，对于东方殖民地、附属国的人民解放斗争，也有很大的指导意义。因此，这篇著作是一个划时代的文献，是对于马克思列宁主义理论的重大贡献。
    由于中国共产党的参加和领导，由于广大工农群众的发动起来，一九二六年七月从广州开始的反对帝国主义反对军阀的北伐战争迅速取得了伟大的胜利。但当时共产党的领导者陈独秀犯了右倾机会主义的错误，排斥毛泽东同志的正确路线，致使这个革命走到半路便被买办豪绅地主阶级的代表所叛卖了。一九二七年四月十二日，买办豪绅地主阶级的代表蒋介石在帝国主义的指使之下，首先在上海举行反革命政变，屠杀了大批的工人和共产党员，宣布了反共。接着，同年四月十五日，又在广东举行所谓“清党运动”，野蛮地屠杀、逮捕大批共产党员和革命的工人、农民、知识分子。五月二十一日，反动军官许克祥又在长沙举行了反革命政变。最后，同年七月十五日，汉口的汪精卫派的国民党亦正式宣布与共产党决裂，向蒋介石投降。第一次国内革命战争由此便遭受了失败。从此以后，蒋介石反动统治者在全国各地实行“宁可错杀一千，不能放过一个”的血腥政策，大规模屠杀共产党员和革命的工人、农民、知识分子，造成了全国反革命的白色恐怖。
    一九二七年革命失败后，在党内曾经发生了
    “左”右倾的偏向。正如一九四五年四月二十日中国共产党第六届中央委员会扩大的第七次全体会议通过的“关于若干历史问题的决议”中所指出的：“以陈独秀为代表的一小部分第一次大革命时期的投降主义者，这时对于革命前途悲观失望，逐渐变成了取消主义者。……另一方面，由于对国民党屠杀政策的仇恨和对陈独秀投降主义的愤怒而加强起来的小资产阶级革命急性病，也反映到党内，使党内
    ‘左’倾情绪也很快地发展起来了。这种‘左’倾情绪在一九二七年八月七日党中央的紧急会议（‘八七会议’）上已经开端。‘八七会议’在党的历史上是有功绩的。……但是‘八七会议’在反对右倾错误的时候，却为‘左’倾错误开辟了道路。……这种‘左’倾情绪在‘八七会议’后继续生长，到了一九二七年十一月党中央的扩大会议，就形成为‘左’倾的盲动主义（即冒险主义）路线，并使‘左’    倾路线第一次在党中央的领导机关内取得了统治地位。……但是由于这个错误路线一开始就引起了毛泽东同志和在白色区域工作的许多同志的正确的批评和非难，并在实际工作中招致了许多损失，到了一九二八年初，这个‘左’倾路线的执行在许多地方已经停止，而到同年四月（距‘左’倾路线的开始不到半年时间），就在全国范围的实际工作中基本上结束了。”
    毛泽东同志在“八七会议”以后，到湖南东部组织领导了农民的秋收起义。一九二七年十月，他率领了秋收起义所组织起来的武装，到达了湖南与江西边界的罗霄山脉的中段——井冈山。毛泽东同志没有采取如南昌起义以后南下潮汕那样的军
    事行动，也没有采取如广州起义以后在城市建立
    政权那样的军事行动，而是看准了中国社会的特殊
    情况，看准了统治阶级内部的矛盾，看准了当时
    革命的主观力量和群众条件，选择了群众基础好、反动统治力量薄弱、地形上有险可守而又可以产生
    重大政治影响的地区，创立工农武装割据的农村革命根据地。到达井冈山以后，不是掩旗息鼓地隐蔽起来，而是坚决地大张旗鼓地和敌人斗争。即：创建红色政权，反对逃跑主义；发动群众深入土地革命；军队党帮助地方党的发展，正规红军帮助地方武装的发展；割据地区的扩大采取波浪式的推进政策，反对冒进政策；扎下根来建设革命的根据地。从这些具体的革命实践中可以证明，毛泽东同志在那时对于中国革命应当到那里去、应当如何做法等问题，已经考虑成熟了。在当时的情况下能够采取这样的做法，是毛泽东同志把马克思列宁主义具体运用于中国革命的天才的表现。这是中国革命运动历史上、也是世界无产阶级革命运动历史上从未有过的革命斗争的类型的创造。毛泽东同志，只有毛泽东同志运用他精湛的马克思列宁主义的理论，通过对于中国社会、中国历史、敌我情况、周围环境科学的深刻的调查研究，找到了根据中国特殊情况而产生的中国革命的规律，并根据这规律，亲自参加和领导了革命的实践，冲破了白色恐怖的氛围，在井冈山上高高地树立起革命红旗。这面红旗的树立，向反动派宣告中国革命没有失败，中国共产党和中国人民是打不倒的；对全国的共产党员、革命志士来说，则是树立了光辉的榜样；昭示着中国革命的前程，昭示了中国革命应该如何具体革法才是正确的，具体揭露和反对了“左”右倾机会主义的错误路线，杰出地创造了把马克思列宁主义理论正确运用到中国革命事业的光辉榜样。此后，其他地方起义中组织起来的部队，凡是按照毛泽东同志的路线和政策，对这些武装部队实行正确领导的地方，那里的革命武装斗争就逐步发展了起来；反之，就无一例外地遭到惨痛的失败。毛泽东同志在这样革命的紧急关头表现出的这种大智大勇，充分地显示出他马克思列宁主义理论的渊深的素养，显示出他革命领袖的天才。
    一九二八年七月党的第六次全国代表大会，彻底清算了陈独秀的投降主义，也批判了“左”倾盲动主义的错误。它的路线基本上是正确的。正如
    “关于若干历史问题的决议”中所指出的：“它正确地肯定了中国社会是半殖民地半封建社会，指出了引起现代中国革命的基本矛盾一个也没有解决，因此确定了中国现阶段的革命依然是资产阶级民主革命，并发布了民主革命的十大纲领。它正确地指出了当时的政治形势是在两个革命高潮之间，指出了革命发展的不平衡，指出了党在当时的总任务不是进攻，不是组织起义，而是争取群众。它进行了两条战线的斗争，批判了右的陈独秀主义和‘左’的盲动主义，特别指出了党内最主要的危险倾向是脱离群众的盲动主义、军事冒险主义和命令主义。这些都是完全必要的。另一方面，第六次大会也有其缺点和错误。它对于中间阶级的两面性和反动势力的内部矛盾，缺乏正确的估计和政策；对于大革命失败后党所需要的策略上的有秩序的退却，对于农村根据地的重要性和民主革命的长期性，也缺乏必要的认识。”毛泽东同志没有参加这次大会，却坚决地执行了六次代表大会的决议。毛泽东同志在实践上发展了这次大会决议中的正确方面，并解决了大会决议中所尚没有解决或没有正确地解决的问题，而且在理论上更具体地和更完满地给了中国革命的方向以马克思列宁主义的科学根据。毛泽东同志在党员执行党的决议上创造性地作出了光辉的示范。
    毛泽东同志的这篇著作发表在一九二八年十月，也就是在开始井冈山工农武装割据的一年以后。在这一年中，由于毛泽东同志拟定的策略和政策的正确，根据地有了扩展，土地革命日益深入，群众基础更形牢固；由于一九二八年四月朱德同志率领南昌起义的部队来到井冈山与毛泽东同志胜利会师，主力红军较前壮大，并在从四月到七月的四个月内粉碎了敌人的三次围攻。但是，当时湖南省委代表杜修经错误地不顾边界特委和永新县委的反对（当时湖南省委是边界特委的上级组织），强使红军分兵向湘南冒进，致使红军遭受到八月的失败。毛泽东同志亲自率领了一个营的部队去接应和会合南进的部队，在九月以后又重新打开了局面，恢复了边区，挽救了八月的失败。这一年的历史事实已证明了：如果依据毛泽东同志指示的策略和政策办事，其结果就是割据地区一天一天扩大，土地革命一天一天深入，人民政权的组织一天一天推广，红军和赤卫队一天一天壮大；反之，如果脱离了毛泽东同志的策略和政策的指导，其结果就是红军受到挫折，根据地缩小以至丧失，群众受到摧残。八月失败就是明显而深刻的教训。
    当时在党内军内也有一部分同志对于时局的估量和革命的具体道路还缺少正确的认识，他们“没有在游击区域建立红色政权的深刻的观念，因此也就没有用这种红色政权的巩固和扩大去促进全国革命高潮的深刻的观念。他们似乎认为在距离革命高潮尚远的时期做这种建立政权的艰苦工作为徒劳”（毛泽东：“星星之火，可以燎原”）。有些同志在困难和危急的时候，甚至怀疑这样的红色政权的存在，而发生悲观情绪，怀疑“红旗到底打得多久”。因此，从理论上说明红色政权所以能够产生、存在和发展的原因，以统一党内、军内的认识，明确革命的具体道路，加强胜利信心，是一个迫切的课题。毛泽东同志恰合时宜地从事了这种理论工作，他科学地分析了第一次大革命失败以后的政治经济情况，指出了在国民党新军阀的统治之下，“全国工农平民以至资产阶级，依然在反革命统治底下，没有得到丝毫政治上经济上的解放。”提出“中国迫切需要一个资产阶级的民主革命，这个革命必须由无产阶级领导才能完成。”指出“中国的民主革命的内容，……包括推翻帝国主义及其工具军阀在中国的统治，完成民族革命，并实行土地革命，消灭豪绅阶级对农民的封建的剥削。”毛泽东同志运用辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的科学方法，深刻地分析了中国社会的特点和敌我情况，详细地剖析了中国红色政权发生和存在的原因。他当时指出的五点原因，就已给嗣后为长期革命实践所证明的革命致胜的法宝——党的建设问题、武装斗争问题、统一战线问题的创造，提供了最初的也是完善的基础。毛泽东同志实事求是地总结了一年来边界对敌斗争的经验，分析了八月失败的原因和教训，确定了建设和扩展红色政权的一整套的政策。毛泽东同志指出了红色政权的发展前途：“现在中国革命形势是跟着国内买办豪绅阶级和国际资产阶级的继续的分裂和战争，而继续地向前发展的。所以，不但小块红色区域的长期存在没有疑义，而且这些红色区域将继续发展，日渐接近于全国政权的取得。”毛泽东同志在以后发表的“星星之火，可以燎原”中，进一步估计了红色政权的意义：“必须这样，才能树立全国革命群众的信仰，如苏联之于全世界然。必须这样，才能给反动统治阶级以甚大的困难，动摇其基础而促进其内部的分解。也必须这样，才能真正地创造红军，成为将来大革命的主要工具。总而言之，必须这样，才能促进革命的高潮。”斯大林在“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”中说：“不是要指靠社会里已经不再发展的阶层，那怕这些阶层在现时还是占优势的力量，而是要指靠社会里正在发展，具有远大前途的阶层，那怕这些阶层在现时还不是占优势的力量。”
    （斯大林：“列宁主义问题”，莫斯科中文版，七一○页）又说：“为了在政治上不犯错误，便要向前看，而不要向后看。”（同上，七一一页）毛泽东同志在一九二八年时就已经正确地掌握和运用了这个原理。当时，白色政权虽是巩固的，但它是反动的、腐朽的、衰亡的，因而是可以打倒的；当时，一小块或若干小块的红色政权虽处于白色政权的重重包围之中，是弱小的，但它是进步的、新生的、发展的，因而它的前途是“接近于全国政权的取得”。二十五年来的历史事实，充分证实了毛泽东同志这一伟大的预见。岂仅是“接近”而已！今天巩固的人民民主专政的全国政权，正是当时的微小的若干小块的红色政权，在全国规模的扩展。这也就是说，中国革命之所以有今天的胜利，是丝毫不能忽视“中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？”这篇著作的动力作用的。
    在第二次世界大战期间，东方许多殖民地被日本帝国主义占领，当地人民在共产党领导下，利用了帝国主义之间的矛盾，坚持了人民的抗日游击战争，锻炼出一支相当有力的武装力量。在第二次世界大战以后，由于帝国主义阵营的大大削弱，和平民主阵营的强大，中国革命的胜利突破了帝国主义在东方的战线，殖民地人民争取解放斗争的增涨，东方各殖民地至少是某些殖民地的人民就也有可能长期坚持大小不一的革命根据地和革命政权，有可能长期坚持乡村包围城市的革命战争，并有可能由此逐步推进而取得城市，以至最后取得该殖民地全国范围内的胜利。因此，毛泽东同志在中国革命战争初期根据中国特殊情况所作的关于中国革命规律的创造性的分析，就有了更加广泛的指导意义。
    我们回头重温一下当时的情况，重温一下毛泽东同志在那一个时期的著作，就可以更加深刻地体会到毛泽东同志的正确和伟大。
    学习毛泽东同志的这一伟大著作，我认为应当更好地学习毛泽东同志观察问题分析事物处理问题的科学方法，即如何把马克思列宁主义的一般真理具体运用到革命的实践的方法；学习毛泽东同志的革命勇气，即如何在最困难的情况下，以对革命事业坚定不移的胜利信心，冷静地实事求是地分析情况，掌握问题的实质，提出具体克服困难的办法，战胜前进途中的一切困难。今天我们在祖国建设的事业中，无疑地还是会遇到无数困难的，但这些困难如果和毛泽东同志当时所遇到的困难相比，那还是微小的。只要我们坚定地遵循毛泽东同志的一切指示，我们就能在祖国经济建设国防建设光辉的道路上，排除前进途中的一切障碍，奋勇前进。
