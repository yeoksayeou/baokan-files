Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 11th: The Third World Federation of Trade Unions Congress held a meeting on the morning of the 11th and began discussing Louis Saillant's report, chaired by N. M. Shvernik.

    The first speaker was V. Manuel Gutierrez, General Secretary of the Guatemalan Workers' Confederation. He said that the United Fruit Company of the United States was leading the reactionary camp in Guatemala, plotting to establish a government in Guatemala that would carry out its orders. Gutierrez listed several incidents to illustrate the resolute struggle of Guatemalan workers working in foreign monopoly capital enterprises. The strike of the workers of the "Pan American" company lasted more than seventy days and was the longest strike in the history of the Guatemalan trade union movement. Thanks to the support of the Latin American Labor Federation and the World Federation of Trade Unions, the strike was successful. Gutierrez also pointed out that the past two years have been two years of victory in the struggle to achieve organizational unity of the Guatemalan trade union movement. Now, Guatemala has a unified national trade union center and five trade union federations.

    Czech representative Supka then spoke, talking about the achievements of the working people in building socialism and the role of trade unions. He said that the Czechoslovak trade unions abide by the principles of the World Federation of Trade Unions and are working hard to strengthen and consolidate the friendly relations between trade unions and working people of all countries, and to help realize the unity of action of all working people in the struggle to defend world peace.

    Finnish representative Lars Junttila spoke. After pointing out that the Finnish trade unions had actively prepared for this congress, Junttila said that capitalists are stepping up their attacks on the living standards of the broad masses of the Finnish people. However, their offensive has met with increasingly fierce resistance. Junttila emphasized the great importance of developing trade with countries in the democratic camp for Finland. He suggested that the issue of trade with countries in the democratic camp should be mentioned in the resolution of the Congress, as this issue is very important to the working people of many capitalist countries.

    The next speaker was Herbert Warnke, who extended congratulations on behalf of the German delegation composed of workers' representatives from the German Democratic Republic and West Germany. Warnke said: For us German industrial workers and employees, the international solidarity of the working class of all countries and the unity of the German working class are of particular significance, because this unity will help peacefully resolve the German issue and guarantee peace in Europe. But to accomplish this most important task, the German working class must overcome its divisions and build united action in the common struggle waged by the working people of West Germany and the working people of the German Democratic Republic. He said: The German delegation wholeheartedly supports the proposal put forward by Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which calls on the Third World Trade Union Congress to call on all trade unions and all working people in Europe to unite and fight together to avoid the danger of war and against the ratification of the Bonn and Paris treaties.

    Burmese representative Than Ngwe talked about the struggle of the Burmese Progressive Trade Union Federation to strive for united action among the working people. He said: The World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau's program of struggle to increase wages, improve conditions, and fight for democratic freedom and peace has been warmly supported by the Burmese working people. He said that Burmese workers know from their own experience that only unity can achieve victory.

    Víctor Casanova, Secretary General of the Chilean United Workers' Union, listed many facts and figures to illustrate the deteriorating situation of Chilean workers. He said: The movement to strive for unity is developing widely in Chile on the basis of the workers' common struggle to improve living conditions. One of the main results of this movement is the establishment of the National Unified Trade Union of the Chilean working people. Workers are holding strikes more and more frequently. They are fighting for direct economic demands, for land reform, for the abolition of repressive laws, and for trade union rights and people's freedom.

    The next speaker was Samgata Sangam, a member of the Central Council of the Ceylon Trade Union Federation. He talked about the control of the Ceylon economy by British monopoly capital. To this day, 80 percent of Ceylon's tea plantations and almost half of the rubber plantations are owned by British capitalists. Due to the control of foreign companies, Ceylon's economy has suffered a deep crisis, and the working people have suffered the most. He talked about the strike of 500,000 plantation workers in Ceylon this year and the August general strike against raising rice prices. He said that, like many other strikes, the August general strike was joined by trade unions that did not belong to the World Federation of Trade Unions, which was an important step in promoting trade union unity in Ceylon.

    Then, a delegation from Austrian workers' organizations entered the venue, and the venue resounded with warm applause. The delegation presented bouquets and gifts from the Austrian working people to the chairman of the conference, Shvernik. Hennig, a member of the Standing Committee of the Austrian Trade Union Federation, read out the congratulatory telegram from the Austrian trade union organization to the conference. Shvernik gave a reply.

    The last speaker at the morning meeting was Marta Matamoros, representative of the Panama Workers' Confederation. She said that the entire life of Panama is controlled by the American Panama Company. This company hinders the economic development of Panama and discriminates against Panamanian workers in terms of working conditions and wages. The combat organization of the Panamanian working class, the Panama Workers' Confederation, is waging a heroic struggle against the control of foreign companies. It actively participated in the struggle to demand that the United States withdraw its military bases from Panamanian territory. It is also fighting for the revision of the unequal treaty signed between Panama and the United States in 1903.

    Xinhua News Agency, 13th: According to TASS, Vienna: The Third World Federation of Trade Unions Congress continued its discussion of Saillant's report at the afternoon meeting on the 11th.

    The meeting was chaired by Lallrip. The first speaker at the meeting was Algerian workers' representative André Luiz. He said: The Algerian working class fully supports the program and activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions. He pointed out: The situation of Algerian workers is deteriorating day by day, trade union and democratic rights have been abolished, and participants in the national liberation movement have been subjected to bloody suppression, one of the reasons for which is the betrayal of trade union splitters. He said that Algerian workers understand how great the significance of international solidarity is for their own liberation struggle.

    The next speaker was Dutch representative Brandson, who pointed out the disastrous consequences of the "Marshall Plan" in the Netherlands. He said that the living standards of the Dutch working people are currently lower than before the war. He said: The Dutch progressive trade unions are constantly fighting to increase wages, and in many enterprises and many industrial sectors, the working people have achieved great success. Because workers have achieved unity on the basis of various demands, right-wing trade union leaders have been forced to support workers' demands in many cases.

    Next, Shvernik, the head of the Soviet delegation, spoke. When he appeared on the podium, thunderous applause resounded for a long time.

    Basile, representative of the Palestinian United Labor Party Group in the Israeli Histadrut, spoke about the struggle of Israeli workers for united action. He said that no matter how the right-wing leaders of the Israeli Histadrut carry out divisive activities, they cannot destroy the sympathy of the Israeli masses for the World Federation of Trade Unions. He said that the Israeli working people demand peace and progress, and demand to get rid of colonial and capitalist exploitation. We extend our hands to all the working people of the Arab countries, working together to establish true peace between Israel and the Arab countries without foreign interference.

    Next, Jean Lafitte, Secretary General of the World Peace Council, spoke. He pointed out: The working class is the basic force blocking the road to a new war. He called on all trade union organizations to step up their efforts to resolve all international disputes peacefully, prevent the Korean tragedy from recurring, prevent Germany and Japan from becoming breeding grounds for new wars again, and strive to ban weapons of mass destruction. He called on trade unions to step up their struggle to expand trade, oppose revising the United Nations Charter, and strive for the People's Republic of China to obtain its legitimate seat in the United Nations.

    Kristiansen, representative of the Norwegian construction industry union, which participated in the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions", pointed out in his speech that Norway's participation in the North Atlantic Group has deteriorated the lives of the Norwegian people and restricted democratic freedoms. He went on to say: The leadership of the Norwegian Trade Union Federation withdrew from the World Federation of Trade Unions and joined the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions", and it did not allow Norwegian trade unions to participate in the preparations for the Third World Trade Union Congress. However, in all enterprises and all local organizations, people actively carried out the preparations for the congress on the basis of unity, regardless of all threats. This movement to strive for unity shows that the struggle of the working class to improve living standards, strive for social insurance and living rights is developing. He concluded by saying: Norwegian workers are increasingly aware that all the measures taken by the ruling class and the right-wing leadership of the trade union are to prepare for a new war. Now, work is underway to further consolidate the unity of the working people in the struggle for peace.

    世界工会代表大会开始讨论赛扬的报告
    各国代表一致主张加强国际团结
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社维也纳十一日讯：世界工会第三次代表大会十一日上午举行会议，开始讨论路易·赛扬的报告，由尼·米·什维尔尼克担任主席。
    危地马拉工人联合会总书记维·曼努埃尔·古特雷斯第一个发言。他说，美国联合果品公司领导危地马拉的反动阵营，阴谋在危地马拉成立一个执行它的命令的政府。古特雷斯列举了几件事情说明在外国垄断资本企业中工作的危地马拉工人的坚决斗争。“泛美”公司工人的罢工持续了七十多天，是危地马拉工会运动史上最长的一次罢工。由于拉丁美洲劳工联盟和世界工联的支持，这次罢工获得了胜利。古特雷斯并指出，过去两年是争取危地马拉工会运动在组织上团结起来的斗争取得胜利的两年。现在，危地马拉有一个统一的全国工会中心和五个工会联合会。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表苏普卡继起发言，他谈到劳动人民在建设社会主义方面的成就和工会的作用。他说，捷克斯洛伐克工会遵守着世界工联的原则，正在努力加强并巩固各国工会之间和劳动人民之间的友好关系，帮助实现全体劳动人民在维护世界和平的斗争中的行动一致。
    芬兰代表拉尔斯·容蒂拉发言。在指出芬兰工会曾为这次大会进行了积极的筹备工作之后，容蒂拉说，资本家正在加紧进攻芬兰广大人民群众的生活水平。但是，他们的攻势遇到了日益激烈的反抗。容蒂拉强调指出了发展与民主阵营国家的贸易对芬兰的极大重要性。他建议在代表大会的决议中要提到与民主阵营国家贸易的问题，这个问题对于许多资本主义国家的劳动人民是非常重要的。
    接着发言的是赫伯特·瓦恩克，他代表由德意志民主共和国与西德的工人代表组成的德国代表团向大会致贺。瓦恩克说：对我们德国产业工人与职员说来，取得各国工人阶级的国际团结以及德国工人阶级的团结是具有特别重大的意义的，因为这种团结将有助于和平解决德国问题并保障欧洲的和平。但是要完成这个最重大的任务，德国工人阶级便必须克服它的分裂现象，同时在西德劳动人民与德意志民主共和国劳动人民进行的共同斗争中，建立一致行动。他说：德国代表团衷心支持世界工联总书记路易·赛扬所提出的建议，这个建议要求世界工会第三次代表大会号召欧洲所有工会与全体劳动人民团结一致，共同为避免战争危险，为反对批准波恩与巴黎条约而进行斗争。
    缅甸代表丹吴谈到了缅甸进步工会联合会争取劳动人民一致行动的斗争的情况。他说：世界工联执行局所制订的争取增加工资、改善条件，争取民主自由与和平的斗争纲领，得到了缅甸劳动人民的热烈拥护。他说，缅甸工人根据自己的经验，知道只有团结才能取得胜利。
    智利联合工人工会秘书长维·卡萨诺瓦列举了许多事实和数字说明智利工人境况的日益恶化。他说：在工人争取改善生活条件的共同斗争的基础上，争取团结的运动在智利广泛开展起来。这个运动的主要结果之一是：智利劳动人民的全国统一工会成立了。工人们越来越经常地举行罢工。他们为争取直接的经济要求，争取土地改革、争取废除镇压性法律、争取工会权利与人民自由而斗争。
    接着发言的是锡兰工会联合会中央理事会理事桑姆加塔桑。他谈到英国垄断资本对锡兰经济的控制。到现在，锡兰茶树种植园的百分之八十、差不多一半的橡胶种植园为英国资本家所有。由于受外国公司的控制，锡兰的经济遭到了深重的危机，而受害最大的是劳动人民。他谈到今年锡兰五十万种植园工人的罢工和反对提高米价的八月大罢工。他说，像其他许多次罢工一样，参加八月大罢工的有不属于世界工联的工会，这是促成锡兰工会团结的一个重要步骤。
    接着，奥地利工人组织的代表团进入会场，会场上响起了热烈的掌声。代表团把花束和奥地利劳动人民的礼物交给了大会主席什维尔尼克。奥地利工会联合会常务委员会委员亨尼希宣读了奥地利工会组织致大会的贺电。什维尔尼克致了答词。
    上午会议的最后一个发言者是巴拿马工人联合会代表马尔塔·马塔莫罗斯。她说，巴拿马的整个生活都受到美国的巴拿马公司的控制。这家公司阻挠巴拿马经济的发展，在工作条件和工资上歧视巴拿马工人。巴拿马工人阶级的战斗组织、巴拿马工人联合会正进行英勇的斗争，反对外国公司的控制。它积极参加了要求美国撤离巴拿马领土上的军事基地的斗争。它也在进行斗争，要求修改巴拿马在一九○三年与美国签订的不平等条约。
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：世界工会第三次代表大会十一日下午会议继续讨论赛扬的报告。
    会议由勒里普担任主席。首先在会上发言的是阿尔及利亚工人代表安德烈·路易兹。他说：阿尔及利亚工人阶级完全拥护世界工会联合会的纲领和活动。他指出：阿尔及利亚工人境遇日益恶化，工会和民主权利被取消，民族解放运动参加者受到血腥镇压，原因之一是由于工会分裂分子叛变所造成的。他说阿尔及利亚工人懂得，国际上的团结一致对于他们自己的解放斗争具有如何伟大的意义。
    下面一个发言的是荷兰代表布兰德森，他指出了“马歇尔计划”在荷兰所造成的恶果，他说，目前荷兰劳动人民的生活水平比战前还低。他说：荷兰进步工会为提高工资进行经常不断的斗争，在许多企业和许多工业部门中，劳动人民取得了很大的成就。由于工人在各种不同的要求的基础上达到了团结一致，工会右翼领袖在许多情况下被迫支持工人的要求。
    接着，苏联代表团团长什维尔尼克发言，当他出现在讲台上时，暴风雨般的掌声，经久不息。
    以色列犹太总工会中巴勒斯坦统一劳工党集团代表巴西莱在发言中谈到以色列工人争取一致行动的斗争。他说，以色列总工会右翼领袖无论怎样进行分裂活动，也破坏不了以色列劳动大众对世界工联的同情。他说，以色列劳动人民要求和平与进步，要求摆脱殖民地和资本主义剥削。我们向阿拉伯国家全体劳动人民伸出手来，在共同努力，不受外国的干涉而建立以色列和阿拉伯国家的真正和平。
    接着是世界和平理事会总书记让·拉斐德发言。他指出：工人阶级是阻塞新战争道路的基本力量。他号召一切工会组织加紧努力，争取以和平办法解决一切国际争端，制止朝鲜悲剧的重演，制止德国与日本再次成为新战争的温床，争取禁止大规模毁灭的武器。他号召工会加紧斗争，争取扩大贸易，反对修改联合国宪章，争取中华人民共和国得到它在联合国中的合法席位。
    参加了“国际自由工会联合会”的挪威建筑业工会的代表克里斯坦森，在他的发言中指出了由于挪威参加北大西洋集团因而使挪威人民生活恶化、民主自由受到限制的情况。他接着说：挪威工会联合会领导机构退出了世界工联而加入了“国际自由工会联合会”，它不允许挪威的工会参加世界工会第三次代表大会的筹备工作。然而，在一切企业和一切地方组织里，人们都不顾一切威胁，而在团结的基础上积极地进行了大会的筹备工作。这个争取团结的运动说明，工人阶级争取提高生活水平、争取社会保险和生活权利的斗争是发展起来了。他最后说：挪威工人们越来越认识到，统治阶级和工会右派领导当局的一切措施，都是为了准备新战争的。现在，为进一步巩固劳动人民在争取和平的斗争中的团结的工作正在开展着。
