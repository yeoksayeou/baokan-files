    Yao Nationality Farmers Shen Shipin and Feng Laimei Achieve a Bumper Harvest with the Help of a Mutual Aid Team
    A letter from Yao nationality farmers Shen Shipin and Feng Laimei: We used to live in the Xiaoshajiang Yao Mountains in the fourth district of Longhui County, Hunan Province, making a living by chopping firewood and digging soil. Before liberation, we ate corn, wild vegetables, and batter soup, lived in leaky thatched sheds, and wore tattered rags. After liberation, we were emancipated. The People's Government took care of us Yao people and distributed a lot of grain and clothing to help us. During the land reform, in order to improve our lives, the People's Government encouraged us to go down the mountain to farm. Our family of four was allocated nearly six mu of good paddy fields, three large tile-roofed houses, as well as dry land, mountain land, and tools. However, because we didn't know how to cultivate paddy fields and only knew how to dig mountain soil and sell firewood, last year the paddy fields only yielded seven *shi* of grain. After paying off debts, there wasn't much left. Seeing that it wasn't worth it, we silently abandoned the fields and went back to the mountains.

    This February, our township cadre, Comrade Zou Shunbing, came to the mountain again to persuade us to go down the mountain to farm. He said, "If you don't have enough to eat, we'll help you borrow it. If you don't know how to farm, you can join a mutual aid team and learn slowly." When we went down the mountain and reached our doorstep, we saw nine neighbors, including Zou Binghong, using a four-*xian* *taili* (a plow carried by people) to plow our fields non-stop. We thought, "They are so kind. It would be too bad to go back to the mountains. We must work hard to learn production techniques in the future." Following this, we joined the mutual aid team led by Zou Binghong. The comrades in the mutual aid team did their best to help us, lending us five *dan* of sweet potatoes and two *dan* of grain as production rations. Before transplanting rice seedlings, they plowed the fields for us. After the seedlings were transplanted, they helped us borrow 60,000 yuan in fertilizer loans from the bank and sent people to Jiuniu'ao, more than 60 *li* away, to buy lime and oil cake for us to put in the fields. Our fields were too poor, so they also helped us dig up grass and ash, burn soil ash, and collect manure from around the house to apply to the fields. Soon, a thick layer of weeds grew in one of our fields, and the comrades in the mutual aid team helped us pull them out seven times. We heard that this field yielded 24 *shi* of grain in the best harvest year during the Guangxu period; but this year, because they helped us with such intensive cultivation, this field actually yielded 28 *shi* of grain. Our family's 5.98 *mu* of fields yielded a total of 31 *shi* of grain this year, an increase of 24 *shi* compared to last year. Moreover, Zou Baiyi, a production expert in the mutual aid team, also taught us production techniques. The comrades in the mutual aid team are as good to us as our own brothers.

### 瑶族农民沈世品、奉来妹在互助组帮助下得到丰收

专栏：读者来信摘要

    瑶族农民沈世品、奉来妹在互助组帮助下得到丰收
    瑶族农民沈世品、奉来妹夫妇来信：我们原来住在湖南省隆回县四区小砂江瑶山里，靠砍柴挖土过日子。解放前，我们吃的是玉米、野菜、粑粑汤，住的是漏茅棚，穿的是烂布片。解放后，我们翻了身，人民政府照顾我们瑶家人，发了很多粮食和衣服救济我们。土地改革时，人民政府为了要我们过好日子，劝我们下山去种田。我家四口人，分了将近六亩好谷田、三间大瓦屋，还有旱地、山场和用具。可是，因为我俩不会耕水田，只晓得挖山土、砍柴卖，去年水田只打了七石谷，还了账就没剩多少了。我们看到不合算，就没声没气地丢了田回到山里去了。
    今年二月，我们的乡干部邹顺炳同志又上山来，劝我们还是下山种田。他说：“没吃的就帮你们去借，不会种田可以参加互助组慢慢地学。”当我们下山走到家门边，看见邹炳洪等九个乡邻用四橺抬犁
    （用人背的犁）在我家的田里不停地犁着。我们想：“他们真是太好啦，再上山去太对不起人家，以后我们要发狠学习生产技术。”跟着，我们就参加了邹炳洪领导的互助组。互助组的同志们都尽力帮助我们，借给了我们五担红薯、两担谷来作生产口粮。插秧前，把田给我们耕好。秧插下，替我们向银行借了六万元的肥料贷款，还派人到六十多里外的九牛坳买石灰和油枯给我们放下田。我们的田太薄，他们还帮助我刨草皮灰、烧土渣灰，起出屋前屋后的脚粪施到田里。不久，我们的一块田里生了
    一层又深又厚的杂草，互助组里的同志们帮我们扯了七次。听说，这块田在光绪年间一个最好的丰年打过二十四石谷；可是今年因为他们帮助我们这样精耕细作，这块田竟打了二十八石谷。我全家五亩
    九分八厘田，今年共打谷三十一石，比去年增加二十四石。而且，互助组生产能手邹百益同志又教会了我们生产技术。互助组的同志对我们真和亲兄弟一样好。
