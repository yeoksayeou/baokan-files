    Eternal Friendship
    Soviet People's Actor, Stalin Prize Winner, Ma Mi-haoyilov
    I have traveled abroad many times. I have been to Italy, Germany, Bulgaria, and other countries, but no trip has moved me so much or left such a deep impression on me as my trip to the People's Republic of China.

    It is not only the beauty peculiar to this great country: the stern, majestic mountains, the boundless plains covered with well-cultivated square rice paddies, the turbulent rivers that feed millions of people, the ancient cities where every stone represents thousands of years of culture, the beautiful palaces and works of art created by the hands of the people – all of these have naturally left a deep mark on my mind and made a strong impression on me. But the main thing is not this.

    The most important thing is the people of China.

    From the first day of our arrival in the People's Republic of China until the day of our departure, all the members of our Soviet cultural workers delegation felt that they were among the most sincere, kind, friends and brothers.

    The joy that shone in the eyes of the Chinese children, wearing bright red Young Pioneer scarves and as agile as mercury, in the eyes of the gray-haired old people, in the eyes of men and women, their enthusiasm, which was not only welcoming actors and cultural workers, but also welcoming representatives of all the Soviet people, moved us.

    Our travels, concerts, and receptions in this great country are unforgettable, they are moving expressions of the friendship and respect between our two great nations.

    Tens of thousands of spectators have always tirelessly watched the art of the Soviet people, and our actors have especially felt this attention from the audience. Who wouldn't want to perform better than ever in front of such an audience? We really put all our energy into the concerts. That special attention from the audience is the best reward for us.

    I should express my deep gratitude to the Chinese comrades for enabling me to intimately appreciate the high skills of their country's singers, musicians, dancers, actors, and amateur art groups. We are convinced that the art of New China belongs to the masses, to all the people. The musical talent of the broad masses, their excellent sense of rhythm, clearly proves this point. I was very surprised that the Chinese audience sang "Moscow-Beijing," which is popular in the Soviet Union and China, with us in such a harmonious and friendly manner. I happily recall the beautiful singing of the large choirs I heard during the trip, the beautiful melodies of the singers, and the expressive and graceful dances of Mei Lanfang.

    Dear friends! We know that you are now working smoothly to complete the grand plan of national industrialization, and we believe that you can gloriously shoulder this task, because we have seen with our own eyes how enthusiastically you are building dams, factories, and railways, and how hard you are studying the experience accumulated by the Soviet people in building a new and beautiful society for more than 30 years. The wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong is the guarantee of your success.

    I am very happy because I not only saw Comrade Mao Zedong, the tested leader of the Chinese people, but also talked to him. I often talk to my comrades about this meeting, and I also often talk about visiting the hometown of this great man, seeing the simple little house where he was born, and the city where he spent his childhood.

    My friends! The word "peace" now inspires all honest people on earth. After arriving in your beautiful country, I saw how much you all cherish it, and you not only demand peace, but also fight for peace. We have seen the love and care that the Chinese People's Volunteers, who helped the Korean brothers defend the freedom and independence of their country, have received. We watch their selfless struggle against the aggressors with deep sympathy, and we rejoice with you for the great victories they have won.

    On my piano there is a porcelain cup with red Chinese characters: "The great friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union is a reliable guarantee of peace in the Far East and the world." This is not just a gift, it is a symbol of our two great nations consolidating Sino-Soviet friendship and resolutely defending world peace. We will work tirelessly and spare no effort to fight for this beautiful goal!

    Friends! On this great holiday – the fourth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which is celebrated by all progressive mankind – I congratulate you with all my Russian heart on achieving new successes in your life and work.

    Long live the friendship between our two great nations!

    永恒的友谊
    苏联人民演员  斯大林奖金获得者   马·米哈伊洛夫
    我曾在国外作过多次旅行。我到过意大利、德国、保加利亚和其他各国，但是任何一次旅行都没有像在中华人民共和国的旅行这样使我感动，使我留下这样深刻的印象。
    事情不仅在于这个伟大国家所特有的美：严峻的、雄伟的山，披复着耕种得很好的方形稻田的一望无际的平原，供养数百万人的汹涌的大河，每块石头都代表着千年文化的古老的城市，人民双手创造出来的美丽的宫殿和艺术作品——所有这些自然在我的脑海里刻上了一条深痕，使我产生了强烈的印象。但是主要的不在于此。
    最主要的是中国的人民。
    从到达中华人民共和国的第一天直至离开那一天，我们苏联文化工作者代表团全体团员都感到自己是处身在最真挚的、最亲切的友人和兄弟之间。
    围着鲜红的少先队领巾、像水银一样灵活的中国儿童的眼里，头发斑白的老年人的眼里，男人和女人的眼里所闪烁着的那种愉快，他们那种不仅是欢迎演员和文化工作者，而像是欢迎全体苏联人民的代表的那种热情，感动了我们。
    我们在这个大国的旅行、音乐会和欢迎会都使我不能忘怀，它们是两大民族间的友谊和敬爱的动人的表现。
    数以万计的广大观众始终不倦地注视着苏联人民的艺术，我们演员们特别感到了观众们的这种注意。在这样的观众面前谁不想尽其可能表演得更好呢。我们确实把全部精力都放在音乐会里了。观众的那种特殊的注意是给我们的最好的奖赏。
    中国的同志们使我能够亲切地认识到他们国家的歌唱家、音乐家、舞蹈家、演员的高度技巧和业余的艺术团体，我应当向他们表示深深的谢意。我们深信，新中国的艺术是群众的，是属于全体人民的。广大群众的音乐才能、很好的韵律感，明确地证明了这点。中国观众那样协调和友爱地和我们一起歌唱在苏联和中国受到欢迎的莫拉特里的“莫斯科——北京”，这使我非常惊奇。我愉快地想起了在旅行时听到的大合唱队的美丽的歌声，歌手们的美妙的曲调，梅兰芳的那种富于表情的优美的舞蹈。
    亲爱的朋友们！我们知道你们现在顺利地为完成国家工业化的宏伟计划而努力，我们相信你们能光荣地担负起这个任务，因为我们亲眼看见你们多么热情地建筑堤坝、工厂、铁路，多么努力地学习苏联人民建设新的、美丽的社会的三十多年中积累下来的经验。以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的英明领导，就是你们成功的保证。
    我非常幸福，因为我不仅看见了中国人民的经过考验的领袖毛泽东同志，而且还和他谈过话。我时常和我的同志们谈起这次会见，也常常谈起我到过这位伟大人物的故乡，看过他出生的那所朴素的小屋子和他度过童年时代的城市。
    我的朋友们！“和平”这个字现在鼓舞着地球上一切正直的人。我到了你们美丽的国家后，看见你们大家如何珍贵它，你们不仅要求和平，而且为和平而战斗。我们看到帮助朝鲜兄弟们捍卫他们国家的自由与独立的中国人民志愿军，受到了什么样的爱戴和关注。我们怀着深厚的同情心注视着他们的反对侵略者的忘我的斗争，我们和你们一起为他们所获得的伟大胜利而欢欣。
    在我的钢琴上有一只瓷杯子，上面绘有红色的中国字：“中苏两大民族的伟大友谊是远东和全世界和平的可靠保证”。这不单纯是个礼物，这是我们两大民族巩固中苏友谊、坚决保卫世界和平的象征。我们将毫不懈怠地、不惜余力地为这个美丽的目的而奋斗！
    朋友们！在这个伟大的节日——中华人民共和国成立四周年的日子，全体进步人类都在庆祝这个节日，我以一个俄罗斯人的全副心意来祝贺你们在生活和劳动中获得新的成就。
    我们两大民族间的友谊万岁！
