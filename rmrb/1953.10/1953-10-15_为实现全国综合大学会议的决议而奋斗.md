    The First National Comprehensive University Conference recently convened by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government has summarized the educational work of comprehensive universities since the restructuring of departments, clearly defined the direction, tasks, and training objectives of comprehensive universities, resolved some pressing issues, and reviewed the leadership work of the Central Ministry of Higher Education. This has greatly strengthened everyone's confidence in improving the work of comprehensive universities.
    Over the past four years, comprehensive universities in our country have generally carried out preliminary curriculum reforms, ideological remolding, departmental adjustments, and teaching reforms, achieving certain results. However, there were also many problems in the past work of comprehensive university education, mainly that the direction, tasks, and training objectives of comprehensive universities were not clear enough, the thinking of teachers and students was quite confused, and the teaching order was very unstable. This was mainly because the leading departments of higher education did not sufficiently recognize the proper position and role of comprehensive universities in the new Chinese higher education system, and did not give them the attention they deserved. Therefore, there were some deviations in grasping and implementing the guidelines for the adjustment and reform of higher education. In the department adjustments, the arrangement of manpower, financial resources, and materials did not adequately take into account the historical advantages, departmental characteristics, and actual needs of some universities, and some measures were not entirely appropriate, causing some schools to suffer losses in strength. In teaching reform, there was neither sufficient preparation for science subjects nor an excessively urgent demand. Professional settings lacked planning, and the arrangement of undergraduate and specialized courses was not appropriate enough. In addition, the failure to combine the study of Soviet experience with the actual situation in various aspects caused teachers and students to be busy and confused. For liberal arts, a passive attitude was adopted, lacking concrete steps, especially failing to fully utilize the potential strength of teachers. This conference focused on criticizing the erroneous thinking of neglecting the educational work of comprehensive universities, making everyone clearly understand the direction, tasks, and training goals of comprehensive universities, the position that comprehensive universities occupy in the current national construction cause, the role they should play, and the significance of professional settings and scientific research work of comprehensive universities. This is a great gain.
    There is no doubt that higher education institutions in our country must prioritize higher industrial schools and concentrate more manpower and material resources to run higher industrial schools well to meet the urgent needs of national economic construction. But this does not mean that comprehensive universities can be ignored, because comprehensive universities have their own functions that cannot be replaced by any specialized higher education institutions. Comprehensive universities should be the foundation of various specialized higher education institutions and various scientific research institutions, and an important symbol of the country's cultural and scientific development. The task of general specialized schools is mainly to train specialized personnel engaged in practical work in technical science, such as engineers. The task of comprehensive universities is mainly to train research or teaching personnel in theoretical or basic sciences (natural sciences and social sciences), and to transport research and teaching cadres to various economic and cultural sectors. More specifically, the task of comprehensive universities is to train scientific research workers and teachers for higher education institutions and teachers for secondary schools that meet certain standards. The talents cultivated by comprehensive universities should have a higher theoretical level and broader scientific knowledge, be able to understand the basic laws of general natural science or general social science, and on this basis, conduct professional research, gradually develop the ability to independently and creatively conduct research, and be good at solving certain theoretical and practical problems in their own professional fields on the basis of Marxist-Leninist methodology, and promote the advancement of all sciences. Comprehensive universities and various specialized higher education institutions have a complementary relationship, and they are the key to improving the theoretical level of various sciences.
    In order to effectively implement the direction of comprehensive universities determined by this conference, correctly learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is a key issue. On this issue, on the one hand, we must deeply recognize the long-term, complex, and arduous nature of teaching reform work, overcome the idea of greed and rashness, and at the same time oppose the conservative idea of being content with the status quo. One of the basic experiences of Soviet education reform is that we must adopt a steady and progressive approach based on the actual situation. In department adjustments, in professional adjustments and settings, in specialization issues, and in scientific research work, we must resolutely implement the principle of combining learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with the actual situation in China. In terms of the scope and purpose of scientific research, we should first study the advanced educational experience of the Soviet Union, study Soviet textbooks, appreciate their superiority, and on this basis, criticize the educational thoughts, textbook content, and teaching methods of British and American capitalism, gradually improve the teaching level of teachers, enrich existing majors, and prepare conditions for specialization and the establishment of new majors. Secondly, we must cooperate with various scientific research institutions and various business departments to study practical problems and promote practical work and scientific research work. Everything must proceed from the actual situation, and there should be different requirements and progress according to the specific situation of different schools and different majors, and we must not force uniformity. Scientific research work must be combined with teaching work and become an important method to improve the teaching level. The idea that the two cannot be coordinated is wrong. The purpose of scientific research work is to improve the teaching level and solve practical problems in national construction. It must proceed from actual needs, not from personal interests, and cannot be studied behind closed doors. The brilliant achievements of Soviet scientific research work are inseparable from its characteristic of combining with practice and with the wisdom and creative labor of the masses. To learn from Soviet scientific research work, we must first learn this basic characteristic.
    Another key to improving the educational work of comprehensive universities is to strengthen the unity of teachers. Only through the mutual assistance and unity of all teachers can we effectively learn from Soviet experience, universally improve the teaching level of teachers, and implement the direction of comprehensive universities. In the past few years, comprehensive universities have made achievements in implementing the Party's policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals, but there are also some problems. Some schools do not have a comprehensive view of old teachers, fail to give full play to the strength of old teachers, and even form a certain degree of abnormal state between new and old teachers and between teachers and students, which seriously affects the improvement of teaching work and the political, ideological, and professional level of new and old teachers. To do a good job in teaching, we must first rely on teachers. In order to gradually improve themselves and better complete the teaching tasks, new and old teachers must correctly recognize their respective strengths and weaknesses, recognize the importance of learning from each other's strengths, learning from each other, helping each other, and the necessity of sincere and frank criticism and self-criticism. This is a prerequisite for improving teaching work.
    The National Comprehensive University Conference has clearly pointed out the road for the steady development and improvement of national comprehensive universities. As long as we correctly learn from Soviet experience based on our national actual conditions, continuously strengthen the unity of teachers, and give full play to the role of the collective, we will definitely be able to gradually complete the glorious tasks assigned to comprehensive universities by the state and the people.

    为实现全国综合大学会议的决议而奋斗
    中央人民政府高等教育部最近召开的第一次全国综合大学会议，总结了院系调整以来的综合大学教育工作，明确地规定了综合大学的方针、任务和培养目标，解决了一些急待解决的问题，并检查了中央高等教育部的领导工作。这就大大加强了大家对改进综合大学工作的信心。
    四年以来，我国的综合大学教育，一般都进行了初步课程改革、思想改造、院系调整和教学改革等工作，取得了一定的成绩。但在过去综合大学教育工作中也存在着不少问题，主要是综合大学的方针任务和培养目标不够明确，师生思想相当混乱，教学秩序很不安定。这主要是由于高等教育的领导部门对综合大学在新中国高等教育体系中的应有地位和作用认识不足，没有予以应有的重视，因而在掌握、执行高等教育的调整和改革方针时有一些偏差。在院系调整上，对人力、财力、物力的安排，没有适当照顾到某些大学的历史优点、科系特长和本身的实际需要，有些措施不尽妥当，使一部分学校的力量受到损失。在教学改革上，对理科，既没有充分准备，又要求过急，专业设置缺乏计划性，而对本科和专修科的摆法也不够妥当。加之在学习苏联经验时没有结合各方面的实际情况，造成师生忙乱现象。对文法科，则采取了一种消极态度，缺乏具体步骤，特别是没有充分发挥教师们的潜在力量。这次会议着重地批判了忽视综合大学教育工作的错误思想，使大家清楚地认识了综合大学的方针、任务及培养目标，认识了综合大学在当前国家建设事业中所占的地位和应起的作用，认识了综合大学的专业设置和科学研究工作的意义。这是很大的收获。
    毫无疑问，我国高等学校必须以高等工业学校为第一位的重点，必须集中较多人力、物力来办好高等工业学校，以适应国家经济建设的迫切需要。但这并不是说，可以忽视综合大学，因为综合大学有综合大学的作用，不是任何专科性高等学校所能代替的。综合大学，应该是各专科性高等学校和各种科学研究机构的基础，应该是国家文化和科学发展的一个重要标志。一般专科性学校的任务主要是培养技术科学方面从事实际工作的专门人材，如工程师等。而综合大学的任务主要是培养理论或基础科学（自然科学和社会科学）方面的研究工作或教学工作的人材，为各经济部门和文化部门输送研究和教学干部。更具体地说，综合大学的任务就是培养合乎一定规格的科学研究工作者和高等学校的师资以及中等学校的师资。综合大学培养出来的人材应该具有较高的理论水平和较广博的科学知识，能通晓一般自然科学或一般社会科学的基本规律，并在此基础上，进行专业研究，逐渐养成能独立地、创造性地进行研究工作，并善于在马克思、列宁主义方法论的基础上解决自己专业方面的某些理论和实际的问题的能力，推动一切科学前进。综合大学和各种专科性高等学校有相辅相成的关系，它是提高各种科学的理论水平的关键所在。
    为了有效地执行这次会议所确定的综合大学的方针，正确地学习苏联先进经验是一个关键性的问题。在这个问题上，我们一方面必须深刻认识教学改革工作的长期性，复杂性和艰巨性，克服贪多冒进思想，同时又要反对安于现状的保守思想。苏联教育改革的基本经验之一，就是必须根据实际情况，采取稳步前进的方针。在院系调整上，在专业调整和设置上，在专门化问题上，在科学研究工作上，我们都要坚决执行学习苏联先进经验与中国实际情况相结合的方针。就科学研究的范围和目的说，首先应该研究苏联先进的教育经验，研究苏联教材，体会其优越性，并据此以批判英美资本主义的教育思想、教材内容和教学方法等，逐步提高教师的教学水平，充实现有专业，并为专门化和新专业的设置准备条件。其次，必须配合各科学研究机构和各业务部门，研究实际问题，推动实际工作和科学研究工作前进。一切都要从实际情况出发，应该按照不同学校、不同专业的具体情况而有不同的要求和进度，决不能强求一律。科学研究工作必须与教学工作相结合，成为提高教学水平的重要方法之一，认为二者不能配合进行的思想，是不对的。科学研究工作的目的是为了提高教学水平，解决国家建设工作中的实际问题，必须从实际需要出发，不能从个人兴趣出发，不能关门研究。苏联科学研究工作的辉煌成就，是跟它与实际相结合、与群众的智慧和创造性劳动相结合这一特点分不开的。我们学习苏联的科学研究工作，首先要学习这个基本特点。
    改进综合大学教育工作的另一个关键在于加强教师的团结。只有通过全体教师的互助团结，才能有效地学习苏联经验，才能普遍提高教师们的教学水平，才能贯彻执行综合大学的方针。几年来，综合大学在执行党的团结和改造知识分子的政策上，是有成绩的，但也存在着一些问题。有些学校对老教师的看法不够全面，没有充分发挥老教师的力量，甚至形成新老教师和师生间某种程度的不正常状态，严重地影响了教学工作的改进和新老教师的政治、思想和业务水平的提高。搞好教学工作首先要依靠教师。为了逐步提高自己，更好地完成教学任务，新老教师必须正确地认识各自的优点和缺点，认识取长补短、互相学习、互相帮助的重要性和诚恳坦白的批评和自我批评的必要性。这是改进教学工作的先决条件。
    全国综合大学会议已经明确地指出了全国综合大学的稳步发展和提高的道路，只要根据我国实际情况，正确地学习苏联经验，不断加强教师的团结，充分发挥集体的作用，就一定能够逐步完成国家和人民交给综合大学的光荣任务。
