From Losing Money to Making Money
——The Improvement of Business Management at the Guangzhou Private Huaxin Weaving Factory
By our reporter Ai Ling

The Huaxin Weaving Factory is a relatively large private factory in Guangzhou, with nearly 400 employees and 164 looms. In the past, the "Yunhe" woolen fabric and "Chunqiu" woolen fabric produced by the factory were sturdy, durable, and did not fade, selling well in South China and even as far as North China.

Before liberation, the factory's capitalists did not engage in honest production but relied entirely on speculation to seek exorbitant profits. After liberation, the capitalists still did not improve business management. The factory did not establish a sound organization to lead production, nor did it have cost accounting. Especially after the "Five-Anti" campaign, due to the capitalists' lack of understanding of the government's policies and their passive and resistant attitude towards production, production difficulties increased. Product costs were high, quality declined, and production became increasingly abnormal, resulting in monthly losses and frequent wage arrears. The factory's trade union organization also did not fully understand the Party and government's policies towards private industry. It failed to strengthen worker education and did not focus on developing production as its central task, instead burying itself in worker welfare; labor discipline among a few workers was quite lax.

This situation only gradually turned around after the factory launched a democratic reform movement in December of last year under the leadership of the Private Enterprise Democratic Reform Committee.

At the beginning of the democratic reform, the Party and the trade union at the Huaxin Weaving Factory grasped the importance of conducting class education and policy education for the workers. Through a series of class education activities such as expressing grievances, digging up roots, and comparing the past with the future, the workers rapidly improved their class consciousness. Previously, most workers believed that working in private enterprises had no future and they just got by day after day. Now, seeing a bright future, they understood their responsibility to actively promote and assist capitalists in improving business management. They actively participated in the democratic reform work, first by accusing and exposing the feudal foremen. Then, under the leadership of the Party and the trade union, they summarized half a year's work and discussed the question of "why the factory is not doing well." The trade union also reviewed its past mistakes of long-term failure to "face production," further promoting a surge in production inspections. Workers put forward the slogan of "find loopholes, plug loopholes." Using detailed accounting and criticism and self-criticism, they identified phenomena of slack labor discipline affecting production and causing waste, and established a conscious labor discipline. In order to help the capitalists overcome difficulties, they voluntarily offered not to receive year-end double pay. In order to plug loopholes and improve production, they successively put forward more than 100 rationalization proposals, reasonably adjusted labor organization, modified machinery and equipment, used yarn-spinning machines instead of hand-pulled yarn, and cone-winding machines instead of hand-pulled cones, saving more than 20 laborers. They changed the original one-shift system to a day and night two-shift operation, formulated systems for receiving and dispatching, purchasing, production records, fabric inspection, and warehouse management, and established production management and production responsibility systems. Through this series of work, they improved business management and strengthened economic accounting. Over the past six months, they have saved more than 420 million yuan and begun to reverse the factory's loss-making situation. In this situation, the workers urged the capitalists to formulate production plans and sign "labor-capital contracts," bringing production back to normal. From April of this year, the factory's revenue and expenditure reached a balance, and in May and June, it had already a surplus of more than 24 million yuan.

Seeing these new changes, the capitalists, influenced by the workers' active production, increased their confidence in production and operation, purchased some machines, and expanded production.

In order to further consolidate the results and improve product quality, the leading cadres of the factory's Party and trade union went through a period of exploration. Initially, they proposed to start with "consolidating the system." But the workers said: "Haven't we been implementing the system for a long time?" At this time, the National Textile Workers' Union put forward the call for "no more than three breaks," and the leadership blindly proposed to start with "reducing breaks." This call also did not receive a response from the workers. In this situation, the leading cadres further went deep into the workshops to study the production situation. They gradually discovered that the problems in production were not only many breaks, but also many torn fabrics, many substandard fabrics, and a high stop rate. Which was the key problem? Which problem should we start with? They studied with the workers again and only then clearly realized that torn fabrics were the most important problem affecting product quality. As long as the problem of torn fabrics was solved, other problems such as breaks and stop rates would be easily solved. In order to overcome the phenomenon of torn fabrics, it was necessary to mobilize nine departments, including weaving, wooden frame, threading, large cone, weft insertion, yarn pulling, dyeing, machine calibration, and receiving and dispatching, to improve their work at the same time. The trade union mobilized all employees to use their brains, find tricks, and tap potential to fight for the elimination of "torn fabrics."

However, at that time, some workers still did not clearly understand the problem of torn fabrics. Some workers believed that torn fabrics had nothing to do with their work, some were afraid that admitting their shortcomings at work would lead to wage deductions, and some were afraid of losing face. The trade union conducted education targeting these ideas, combined with the actual situation. For example, they organized workers in the wooden frame department to go to the weaving workshop to understand the causes of torn fabrics, so that the workers in the wooden frame department realized that if the wooden frame had one of six problems such as double yarn, long bottom mouth, lost wooden frame mouth, oil stains, and entanglement, it would cause torn fabrics. They also mobilized weaving workers to automatically record the number and situation of torn fabrics every day and presented them at group meetings for research, to identify problems, and to seek improvement. Through these detailed work, the workers' thinking was opened up and their sense of responsibility for production was strengthened. At the same time, the trade union worked hard to discover advanced working methods among the workers: the weaving worker Lin Rong concentrated on weaving, often paid attention to the fabric surface, patrolled frequently, and had fewer torn fabrics. The trade union called on workers to learn from him. The trade union also organized workers to visit other factories to learn their advanced working methods, and finally gradually eliminated the phenomenon of torn fabrics.

After the key problem of torn fabrics was solved, the workers' enthusiasm became even higher, and they demonstrated a high degree of creativity. Zhong Jinsheng, a machine calibration technician in the second workshop, led the workers in the entire group to master the patrol work method, reducing the stop rate and increasing the amount of fabric woven by 0.7 yards per hour. Xiao Xiankun and Liu Jiebao, machine calibration technicians in the first workshop, successfully trial-implemented the fast machine loading method. In the past, it took 30 minutes per shaft to load the machine with head-of-city cloth and 60 minutes per shaft with weft-inserted cloth. Now, the time has been reduced by half. Due to the workers' initiative and creativity, the quality of the factory's products has improved, costs have been reduced, and the second quarter's processing tasks have been overfulfilled. Previously, the factory produced more than 5,000 pieces per month. Now it can produce more than 6,000 pieces, and the substandard fabric rate has been reduced to 0.77% (the substandard fabric rate stipulated in the contract is 3%), and a large amount of cotton yarn has also been saved. Currently, all the factory's employees are carrying out a red banner competition, striving to reduce the substandard fabric rate to 0.6% and overfulfill the state's processing tasks for the fourth quarter.

    从赔本到赚钱
    ——广州私营华新织布厂改善经营管理的经过
    本报记者　艾　玲
    华新织布厂是广州市一个规模较大的私营工厂，有职工近四百名，一百六十四台织布机。过去该厂出产的“云鹤”布呢、“春秋”布呢，坚厚耐用，不脱色，畅销华南，并远销到华北等地区。
    这个厂的资方，在解放前，不是老老实实的经营生产，全靠投机倒把，牟取暴利。解放以后，资方仍不改善经营管理，全厂没有建立起领导生产的健全机构，没有成本核算。特别在“五反”以后，由于资方不了解人民政府的政策，对经营生产消极怠工，更增加了生产上的困难，产品成本高，质量下降，生产越来越不正常，造成月月赔钱，经常拖欠工资。该厂工会组织也由于不很懂得党和人民政府对私营工业的政策，没有加强对工人的教育，没有以发展生产为自己的中心任务，只是埋头搞工人的福利；少数工人中劳动纪律相当松弛。
    这种情况，直到去年十二月，该厂在私营企业民主改革委员会领导下，开展了民主改革运动，才逐步扭转过来。
    民主改革开始，华新织布厂的党和工会就抓紧了对工人进行阶级教育和政策教育。工人们通过诉苦、挖根、对比前途等一系列的阶级教育，迅速提高了阶级觉悟。从前大多数工人以为在私营企业中干活没有前途，干一天混一天，现在看见了光明的前途，懂得了有责任积极推动和协助资本家改善经营管理，积极起来参加了民主改革的工作，首先控诉和揭发了封建把头。接着就在党和工会的领导下，总结了半年工作，讨论了“为什么工厂搞不好”的问题；工会也检讨了过去工作中长期没有
    “面向生产”的错误，进一步推动了生产大检查的热潮。工人们提出了“查漏洞、塞漏洞”的口号，用算细账和开展批评与自我批评的方法，检查出因劳动纪律松弛影响生产和浪费的现象，建立起自觉的劳动纪律。为了帮助资方渡过困难，主动提出不要年终双薪。为了堵塞漏洞，搞好生产，先后提出各种合理化建议一百多条，合理地调整了劳动组织，改装了机器设备，用打纱机代替手拉纱，筒子机代替手拉打筒，节省了二十多个劳动力，把原来的一班制改成日夜两班操作，制订了收发、采购、生产记录、验布、仓库管理等制度，建立了生产管理和生产责任制。经过这一系列的工作，改善了经营管理，加强了经济核算，半年多来，节约了四亿二千余万元，开始扭转了工厂赔本的局面。在这种情况下，工人又督促资方订出生产计划和签订“劳资合同”，使生产转入正常状况。从今年四月份起，全厂收支达到了平衡，五、六月份已盈余了两千四百多万元。
    资本家看到这些新的变化，在工人积极生产的影响下，提高了生产经营信心，增购了部分机器，扩大了生产。
    为了进一步巩固成果，提高产品质量，该厂党和工会的领导干部经过了一段摸索的过程。起初，他们提出从“巩固制度”入手。但是工人说：
    “我们的制度不是早就执行了吗？”这时候，刚巧全国纺织工会提出“断头不超过三次”的号召，领导上就又盲目地提出从“减少断头”入手。这个号召，同样没有得到工人的响应。在这种情况下，领导干部就进一步深入车间，研究生产情况。他们逐渐发现了生产上存在的问题，不仅是断头多，而且拆布多，次布多，停台率高。那个是关键问题呢？从那个问题入手呢？他们又和工人一起进行研究，这才明确认识到拆布多，是影响产品质量最重要的问题，只要解决了拆布多的问题，其他的断头、停台率等等问题也就容易解决了。为了克服拆布多的现象，必须发动织布、木骨、穿线、大筒、夹纱、拉纱、浆染、校机、收发等九个部门同时改进工作，工会就动员全厂职工开动脑筋，找窍门、挖潜力，为消灭“拆布”而斗争。
    但是，当时部分工人对拆布多的问题还认识不清，有的工人认为拆布多和自己的工作没有关系，有的工人怕承认了自己工作中的缺点后会扣工资，也有的怕面子不好看。工会针对这些思想，结合实际情况进行了教育。如组织木骨部工人到织布车间去了解拆布多的原因，使木骨部工人认识到：木骨如发生双纱、底口长、失木骨口、油污、捞乱等六种毛病中的一种，就会造成拆布的祸害。又发动织布工人自动记录每天拆布的数量、情况，提到小组会上进行研究，找出毛病，求得改进。经过这些细致的工作，打通了工人的思想，加强了生产责任心。同时，工会又努力发现工人中的先进工作方法：织布工人林容织布时精神集中，经常注意布面，勤巡回，拆布就少，工会就号召工人向他学习。工会还组织工人到其他工厂去参观，学习别厂的先进工作方法，终于逐渐消灭了拆布多的现象。
    拆布多的关键问题解决以后，工人情绪更加高涨，发挥了高度的创造性。第二车间校机技工钟锦生，带动全组工人，掌握了巡回工作法，减少了停台率，每小时能多织零点七码布。第一车间校机技工萧贤坤、刘捷宝试行快速上机法成功，过去上机头市布，每轴要花三十分钟，上夹纱布，每轴要六十分钟，现在较前减少了一半的时间。由于工人发挥了积极性和创造性，全厂产品的质量提高了，成本降低了，超额完成了第二季度的加工任务。以前每月出产五千多匹，现在可以出产六千多匹，次布率降低到百分之零点七七（合同上规定的次布率为百分之三），还节余了大量的棉纱。目前全厂职工正开展着红旗竞赛，争取次布率降低到千分之六，超额完成第四季度给国家加工的任务。
