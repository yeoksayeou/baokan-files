Where U.S. Troops Go
Atrocities Happen Daily

According to the obviously greatly reduced figures of the Japanese Police Agency, from September 1945 (when U.S. troops began occupying Japan) to March of this year, the number of crimes committed by U.S. troops stationed in Japan included: 5,592 cases of rape, 4,611 cases of theft, and 3,384 cases of armed robbery and assault.

If these atrocities are averaged per day, the daily "work" of U.S. troops stationed in Japan is: more than two rapes, more than one theft, and more than one armed robbery and assault.

Arson "Doesn't Count as a Crime"

U.S. soldiers stationed in the Kanegaseki area of Tanaabe Town in Aomori Prefecture, Japan, set fires for fun, burning 2,976 *mu* of mountain land in a row. Local people, in anger, questioned the American commander and demanded compensation for the losses from the U.S. military. The commander actually said: "Don't you understand the 'Administrative Agreement'? It states very clearly: Americans in Japan, no matter what they do, it doesn't count as a crime." Finally, he added: "This is a clause that your Prime Minister Yoshida happily stamped his approval on!"

Insulting Women

In August, at the Italian port of Taranto, about a thousand American soldiers gathered on the beach and molested women who were swimming there. Local people were extremely indignant about this, but the Italian police did not intervene.

Actually, what's so strange about this? Last June, U.S. soldiers beat a passerby at random in the city of Cagliari. At that time, an Italian policeman arrived, but not only did he not intervene in the U.S. military's violence, but he even helped the U.S. military continue to beat the innocent passerby. This is probably the spirit of "friendliness" towards the U.S. military that the Italian ruling class often emphasizes!

Drunkenness and Arson

U.S. soldiers stationed in South Korea often commit arson after getting drunk. Since the beginning of this year, more than 1,500 houses have been burned down as a result, and more than 15,000 people have been left homeless.

It is these U.S. soldiers who commit all kinds of evil deeds who, according to the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed by Dulles and Syngman Rhee, plan to be stationed in South Korea for a long time to engage in so-called "cleanup" work!

Rent a Car, Don't Pay

U.S. soldiers in Oxford, England, and other places often rent cars and don't pay the rental fees. Moreover, they often take advantage of the driver's inattention, move their butts, and run away.

In order to deal with the rogue behavior of these American soldiers, British car company owners have come up with a special countermeasure. They have the drivers remove the handles used to operate the switches inside the car doors in advance, so that when American guys who take the car and try not to pay the rental fee try to touch the handle and open the door to run away as they used to, they can't escape.

### 美军所到之处

    美军所到之处
    暴行天天有
    根据日本警察局显然大大缩小了的数字，从一九四五年九月（美国军队开始占领日本）到今年三月，驻日美军的犯罪案就有：强奸案五千五百九十二件，盗窃案四千六百一十一件，武装抢劫和殴打案三千三百八十四件。
    如果把这些暴行事件按天平均计算，驻日美军一天的“工作”是：强奸两次以上，偷窃一次以上，武装抢劫和殴打一次以上。
    放火“不算犯罪”
    驻在日本青森县的田名边町关根地区的美国兵，为了开心取乐，竟放起火来，一连烧了两千九百七十六市亩的山地。当地人民在愤怒之下，就去质问美国的司令官，并要求美军赔偿损失。这个司令官竟说：“你们不懂得‘行政协定’吗？那上面说得很明白：美国人在日本不论干了什么事都不算犯罪。”最后他还补充一句说：“这一条是你们的总理大臣吉田先生很愉快地盖章承认了的呀！”
    侮辱妇女
    八月间，在意大利的港口大兰多，约一千个美国兵凑在海滨，调戏在那里游泳的妇女。当地人民对这件事极为愤慨，然而意大利警察并不干涉。
    其实这有什么稀奇，去年六月间，美国兵在卡利阿利市随便殴打一个过路人。当时，意大利的一个警察赶到了，但他非但没有干涉美军的暴行，反而帮助美军继续殴打那个无辜的路人。这大概就是意大利统治阶级经常强调的对美军的“友善”精神吧！
    酗酒纵火
    驻在南朝鲜的美国兵，酗酒后经常纵火。从今年年初以来，因此被烧毁的房屋已达一千五百多栋，因此无家可归的人已达一万五千多名。
    就是这些无恶不作的美国兵，还要按照杜勒斯和李承晚签订的所谓“共同防御条约”，打算长期驻在南朝鲜，从事所谓“善后”工作呢！
    租了汽车不给钱
    美国兵在英国牛津等地，租了汽车经常不给租费。而且事后常乘司机不备，挪开屁股就跑。
    英国汽车公司的老板们，为了对付美国兵这种撒赖的流氓行径，专门想了一条对策。他们让司机事先把汽车门里做开关用的把柄拆掉，这样，当坐了汽车企图不交租费的美国佬，想按照先前的习惯再去摸把柄开门逃跑时，却逃不掉了。
