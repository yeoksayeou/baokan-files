    Mr. Chen Shutong Donates "One Hundred Masters Painting Plum Blossoms" Scroll
    Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, donated his decades-long collection of the "One Hundred Masters Painting Plum Blossoms" scroll to the state.

    Plum blossoms are one of the subjects of Chinese poetry; Yang Wujiu (also known as Yang Buzhi) of the Song Dynasty and Wang Mian of the Ming Dynasty specialized in painting plum blossoms, forming their own schools. Since then, many painters have painted plum blossoms. Mr. Chen Shutong spent a lot of effort collecting the "One Hundred Masters Painting Plum Blossoms," totaling one hundred and two artists, with a total of one hundred and nine works. Among them are masterpieces by Tang Yin, Chen Lu, Wang Qi, Shao Mi, Dao Ji, Hong Ren, Hu Yukun, the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, and Chen Hao. Chen Lu devoted himself to painting plum blossoms for thirty years, and Hong Ren's pseudonym was Plum Blossom Guna. The eight plum blossom paintings of the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou are all fine works. The collection of "One Hundred Masters Painting Plum Blossoms" was quite difficult. Zheng Banqiao's own inscription said: "I have never painted plum blossoms in my life."

    The above-mentioned "One Hundred Masters Painting Plum Blossoms" has been accepted by the Social Culture Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, and a special exhibition will be held in the Palace Museum.    (Xinhua News Agency)

    陈叔通先生捐献“百家画梅”画幅
    中国人民政治协商会议常务委员会副主席陈叔通把他几十年来搜集珍藏的“百家画梅”画幅捐献给国家。
    梅花是中国诗文中吟咏的对象之一；宋代杨旡咎（即杨补之）和明代王冕专画梅花，自成一家，此后历代画家画梅花的颇不乏人。陈叔通先生费尽心血搜集的“百家画梅”全部凡一百零二家，共一百零九幅。其中有唐寅、陈录、王綦、邵弥、道济、弘仁、胡玉崐、扬州八怪和陈豪诸家的杰作。陈录专力画梅花凡三十年，弘仁的别号就叫做梅花古衲。扬州八怪的八幅梅花，件件都是精品。“百家画梅”的搜集颇不容易，郑板桥的一幅，他自己的题辞就说：“一生从不画梅花。”
    上述“百家画梅”，已由中央人民政府文化部社会文化事业管理局接受，并将在故宫博物院举办专题展览。    （新华社）
