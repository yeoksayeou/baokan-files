    Full text of the notification of September 19, 1953: To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Beijing

    The Royal Swedish Embassy presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, and with reference to the exchange of notes of September 4th and 14th concerning the upcoming political conference, has the honor to convey the following message from the Government of the United States:

    "The United States Government, acting under the authority of paragraph A, Section 5 of Resolution 102 of the United Nations General Assembly of August 28, 1953, has taken note of

    (1) The reply of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on September 13, 1953, to our notification of September 5, 1953, transmitted through the Swedish Government.

    (2) The reply of the People's Republic of North Korea to our notification of September 5, 1953, on September 14, 1953, which was also addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations; both have been forwarded to the United States Government by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

    The United States Government wishes to state the following: (1) The United States Government reminds the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the People's Republic of North Korea that the date of signing the Armistice Agreement was July 27, 1953, and that, according to the recommendation of Article 60 of the Agreement, the political conference should be convened before October 28, 1953. (2) The various resolutions already adopted by the (United Nations) General Assembly regarding the composition of the conference are self-explanatory, and there is nothing more to be said on the matter. We remind your governments once again that on August 28, 1953, the General Assembly passed Resolution 102 A, especially item B thereof, which has been copied to your two governments by the Secretary-General of the United Nations on August 28, 1953. (3) We, representing the member states providing armed forces to the United Nations Unified Command, along with the representatives of the Republic of Korea, as stated in our notification of September 5, 1953, transmitted to you through the Swedish Government, express our willingness to have the political conference convene on October 15, 1953, in San Francisco, Honolulu, or Geneva, Switzerland. Please reply as soon as possible regarding the location and time acceptable to your two governments, as it is necessary to begin preparations for the conference immediately."

    The Royal Swedish Embassy would appreciate receiving a written reply to the above notification and avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China the assurances of its highest consideration.

    Beijing, September 19, 1953

    Full text of the notification of September 24, 1953: To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Beijing

    The Royal Swedish Embassy presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, and with reference to its note of September 19, 1953, has the honor to notify the following on behalf of the Government of the United States:

    "On September 22, 1953, the United States representative made a statement on behalf of the United Nations at the United Nations General Assembly, a portion of which is as follows:

    In accordance with the General Assembly resolution of August 28, the United States is prepared, in consultation with the designated group of countries, to handle the arrangements necessary to ensure the convening of the conference in accordance with the recommendations of the Armistice Agreement, and believes that at the time the conference convenes, the conference itself can deal with any matters not resolved to the satisfaction of both parties by other means. We have seen the letter from the Korean Communist regime stating that the issue of the composition of the political conference cannot be resolved by one party alone, but must be resolved by agreement between the two parties. The United Nations side has already been selected and is proceeding with its work. The other side has already been provided for in the Armistice Agreement, along with the Soviet Union, if the other side so desires. As for the question of whether any neutral countries should be invited, as the North Korean letter states, it is a matter to be agreed upon by both parties. Therefore, if developments during the conference so require, and the other side wishes to raise the issue of adding participating countries, they are, of course, free to do so, as both parties will be present at the conference and able to consider the matter.

    Through the good offices of the Swedish Government, we are once again prepared to notify the Chinese and North Korean Communists of the contents of this statement and urge them to reply promptly. We are eager to facilitate the work of the conference. Moreover, given the urgency of the situation, we are prepared to dispatch a representative immediately to any of the political conference locations we have already proposed, namely San Francisco, Honolulu, or Geneva, to meet with the Chinese and North Korean Communists if doing so would facilitate the negotiation or arrangement of the proposed political conference."

    The Royal Swedish Embassy hopes to receive a written reply to the above notification and avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China the assurances of its highest consideration.

    The Royal Swedish Embassy
    Beijing, September 24, 1953

    Full text of the notification of October 9, 1953: To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Beijing

    The Royal Swedish Embassy presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, and with reference to its note of September 24, 1953, has the honor to notify the following on behalf of the Government of the United States:

    "The United States Government has not received any reply to the notifications it transmitted to you through the Swedish Government on September 5, 19, and 24. The governments of the countries on our side participating in the conference have been designated and are prepared to proceed with the conference as soon as you agree to the necessary prior arrangements. To this end, after consulting with the other participating countries on our side, the United States Government has been requested to contact you and reach agreement on the necessary arrangements.

    As stated in the notification delivered to you on September 5, the United States Government believes that Honolulu, San Francisco, or Geneva could provide facilities conducive to the success of the political conference. In that notification, the United States also suggested October 15 as an appropriate date for the conference to begin. We wish to complete the prior arrangements as soon as possible so that the conference can begin on that date, or as soon as practically feasible after that date.

    The United States Government reiterates its inquiry as to whether these suggestions regarding the time and place of the conference are acceptable to the authorities on the other side. As you have been informed, the United States is also prepared to dispatch a representative to meet with your representative at any of the above locations to seek agreement on the necessary arrangements so that the conference may be convened as soon as possible. The United States representative will be prepared to reach agreement on the time and place of the conference and to exchange views with a view to reaching early agreement on procedural, administrative, and arrangement-related issues that may be appropriate for discussion before the conference begins. At the conference itself, you will also be free to raise other matters at the appropriate time.

    Regarding our arrangements, after careful consideration of different options, they were approved by the (United Nations) General Assembly on August 28. Efforts to have the General Assembly reconsider these matters have been rejected. Therefore, the arrangements approved on August 28 remain in effect. These arrangements are entirely reasonable and will allow the effective implementation of the recommendation contained in Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement, which was proposed and long insisted upon by your side, and agreed to by both sides. We are prepared to negotiate with all reasonableness and sincerity.

    If you have any intention of implementing the recommendation contained in the Armistice Agreement and participating in the Korean political conference with a view to peacefully resolving the Korean issue and the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, you can have no reason to refuse to hold a conference. Your early indication of your views on the matters raised in these notifications is necessary if the Korean political conference recommended in the Armistice Agreement and approved by the (United Nations) General Assembly is to be held within the time stipulated in the Armistice Agreement."

    The Royal Swedish Embassy requests that the above statement be conveyed to the Government of North Korea and avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China the assurances of its highest consideration.

    The Royal Swedish Embassy
    Beijing, October 9, 1953

    Full text of the notification of October 14, 1953: To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Beijing

    The Royal Swedish Embassy presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, and with reference to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note of October 10, 1953, has the honor to notify the following on behalf of the Government of the United States:

    "The United States Government has taken note of the notification of October 10, 1953, from the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the United States Government's notifications of September 19, 24, and October 9.

    The United States Government notes that you have agreed to appoint representatives (plural) to conduct talks with the United States representative (singular) regarding the upcoming Korean political conference. The United States representative will be prepared to meet with your representatives in Panmunjom on October 26. It should be understood that our agreement to this location as the address for the meeting of envoys from both sides should not be construed as indicating that we consider Panmunjom to be an appropriate location for holding the political conference.

    It is assumed that the political conference should be limited to the relevant governments on both sides, as stipulated in Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement, which was initially drafted by your side. In fact, your spokesman, General Nam Il, even insisted that participants be limited to the relevant governments on both sides because some member states of the United Nations had not sent troops to Korea. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that your side has always believed that neutral countries (plural) should participate in the conference. Our composition is stipulated in the resolution passed by the General Assembly on August 28 in accordance with Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement signed on July 27. The General Assembly also suggested that the Soviet Union could be included, if your side so desires.

    The United States, after consulting with the other governments on our side participating, has authorized its representative to reach agreement on the time and place of the conference and to exchange views with a view to reaching early agreement on procedural, administrative, and arrangement-related issues that may be appropriate for discussion before the conference begins. Therefore, our representative will be prepared to address such issues and will also be prepared to exchange views on the issue of the composition of the political conference to the extent consistent with the basis set forth in the preceding paragraphs."

    The Royal Swedish Embassy avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China the assurances of its highest consideration.

    美国政府关于政治会议双方会谈的四个通知
    一九五三年九月十九日的通知全文：致北京、中华人民共和国外交部
    瑞典皇家大使馆向中华人民共和国外交部致意，并就交换九月四日与十四日有关行将到来的政治会议的函件事，谨代替美国政府转知如下：
    “美国政府，按一九五三年八月二十八日联合国大会第一○二号决议案第五段甲项的权力行事，已注意到
    （一）一九五三年九月十三日中华人民共和国中央人民政府致联合国秘书长对我们一九五三年九月五日经由瑞典政府转递的通知的复函。
    （二）一九五三年九月十四日北朝鲜人民共和国对我们一九五三年九月五日通知的复函，此件同样系致联合国秘书长，两者均已为联合国秘书长转交给美国政府。
    美国政府愿声明如下：（1）美国政府提醒中华人民共和国中央人民政府与北朝鲜人民共和国政府，停战协定签字的日期是一九五三年七月二十七日，而按协定第六十款的建议，政治会议应在一九五三年十月二十八日以前召开。（2）（联合国）大会，就会议组成业已通过的各项决议是自明的，关于该事无可多言。我们再次提醒贵国政府，一九五三年八月二十八日大会已通过第一○二号决议案甲，特别是其乙项，此决议案已为联合国秘书长于一九五三年八月二十八日抄给你等两国政府。（3）我们代表向联合国统一司令部提供武装力量的各会员国连同大韩民国的代表，并如同在经由瑞典政府惠转给你们的我们一九五三年九月五日通知中所述，表示愿意使政治会议于一九五三年十月十五日在旧金山、檀香山或瑞士之日内瓦开会。关于你等两国政府可接受的地点与时间，请早予答复，因为立即开始会议的筹备事宜乃是必要的。”
    瑞典皇家大使馆愿得到对上述通知的书面答复，并顺向中华人民共和国外交部重致最崇高的敬意。
    瑞典皇家大使馆
    一九五三年九月十九日于北京
    一九五三年九月二十四日的通知全文：致北京、中华人民共和国外交部
    瑞典皇家大使馆向中华人民共和国外交部致意，并参照其一九五三年九月十九日的公函，谨代替美国政府通知如下：
    “一九五三年九月二十二日，美国代表曾在联合国大会代表联合国方面作一声明，部分如下：
    美国按照八月二十八日大会的决议案，准备在和已指定的一组国家谘商之下，处理为保证依照停战协定的建议而召开会议所必需的安排事宜，并认为在会议召开时，会议本身能够处理未用其他方法，求得双方满意解决的任何事项。我们看到朝鲜共产党政权的来函说：关于政治会议组成的问题，只由一方是解决不了的，而必须是根据双方的协议，才能得到解决。联合国方面已经选定并正在进行工作。对方则在停战协定中已有规定，连同苏联，如果对方愿欲的话。至于是否应邀请任何中立国的问题，正如北朝鲜来函所称，它是一件要由双方协议的事。因此，如果会议期间的发展有此需要，而对方愿欲提出增添参与国的问题的话，当然他们是有自由这样做的，因为会议上双方都出席并能够考虑这个问题。
    经由瑞典政府的斡旋，我们再次准备把这个声明的内容通知中国和北朝鲜共产党人，并促请他们迅即答复。我们亟愿促进会议的工作。而且，鉴于局势的急迫，如果这样做会促进建议中的政治会议的协商或安排的话，我们准备立即派遣一位代表到我们已经提出的政治会议地点，即旧金山、檀香山或日内瓦之中的任何一地，去和中国及北朝鲜共产党人会晤。”
    瑞典皇家大使馆盼能得到对上述通知的书面答复，并顺向中华人民共和国外交部重致最崇高的敬意。
    瑞典皇家大使馆
    一九五三年九月二十四日于北京
    一九五三年十月九日的通知全文：致北京、中华人民共和国外交部
    瑞典皇家大使馆向中华人民共和国外交部致意，并参照其一九五三年九月二十四日的照会，谨代替美国政府通知如下：
    “美国政府对其经由瑞典政府于九月五日、十九日和二十四日转交你们的通知，未曾收到任何答复。我方参加会议的各国政府业已指定，并准备一俟你方同意了必要的预先安排，立即进行会议。为此目的，在与我方的其他参加国谘商之后，美国政府已被请求和你们联系并就必要的安排取得协议。
    如在九月五日交给你们的通知中所述，美国政府认为檀香山、旧金山或日内瓦可提供有利于政治会议之成功的便利。在该通知中，美国亦曾建议十月十五日作为会议开始的一个适当日期。我方愿尽早完成预先安排，以便会议能在该日期，或者在该日期后实际可行的尽早日期开始。
    美国政府再次询问，关于会议时间和地点的这些建议是否为对方当局所能接受。如你们已被告知的，美国也准备派遣一位代表在上述各地的任何一地与你们的代表会晤，以便就必要的安排谋取协议，俾使会议可能尽早召开。该美国代表将准备就会议的时间和地点取得协议，并交换意见以望对程序的、行政管理的、以及安排方面的有关问题早日取得协议，这些问题可能是会议开始前适宜于予以讨论的。在会议本身，在适当的时候，你方也将有自由提出其他事项。
    关于我方的安排，在仔细考虑了不同的方案之后，已于八月二十八日为（联合国）大会所批准。使大会重新考虑这些事项的努力已被拒绝。因此八月二十八日所批准的安排仍然成立。这些安排是完全合理的，并将允许停战协定第六十款所载的建议案得到有效的履行，该建议案是你方所提出并长期坚持，而为双方所同意了的。我方准备以一切合理性与诚意进行协商。
    如果你方有任何打算执行停战协定中所载的建议案并参加朝鲜政治会议，以望和平解决朝鲜问题及从朝鲜撤退外国军队等问题，你方就不能有任何理由拒绝开成会议。你们对这些通知中所提出的事项早日表示意见是必需的，如果停战协定中所建议并为（联合国）大会所批准的朝鲜政治会议要在停战协定所规定的时间以内举行的话。”
    瑞典皇家大使馆谨请将上述声明转知北朝鲜政府，并顺向中华人民共和国外交部重致最崇高的敬意。
    瑞典皇家大使馆
    一九五三年十月九日于北京
    一九五三年十月十四日的通知全文：致北京、中华人民共和国外交部
    瑞典皇家大使馆向中华人民共和国外交部致意，并参照一九五三年十月十日外交部的照会，谨代替美国政府通知如下：
    “美国政府已注意到中华人民共和国中央人民政府与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一九五三年十月十日就美国政府九月十九日、二十四日和十月九日的通知所提出的通知。
    美国政府注意到你方已同意指派代表（多数）与美国代表（单数）进行关于行将到来的朝鲜政治会议的会谈。美国代表将准备于十月二十六日在板门店和你们的代表会晤。应该了解，我们同意这个地点作为双方使者会晤的地址，不得被认为表示我方认为板门店是举行政治会议的适当地址。
    设想政治会议应限双方有关政府的停战协定第六十款，最初是你方起草的。事实上你方发言人南日将军还曾坚持参加者限于双方有关政府，因为联合国的某些会员国没有派军队到朝鲜去。因此，如说你方始终认为中立国（多数）应该参加会议，那是不正确的。我方的组成已规定在大会八月二十八日按照七月二十七日签订的停战协定第六十款而通过的决议案中。大会也建议，苏联可以包括在内，如果你方愿欲的话。
    美国在与我们方面参加的其他政府谘商之后，已授权它的代表就会议的时间和地点达成协议，并交换意见以望对程序的、行政管理的、以及安排方面的有关问题早日取得协议，这些问题可能是会议开始前适宜于予以讨论的。因此，我们的代表将准备处理此等问题，并且也将准备在和前面几段中所提出的基础相符合的范围内，就政治会议的组成问题交换意见。”
    瑞典皇家大使馆顺向中华人民共和国外交部重致最崇高的敬意。
    瑞典皇家大使馆
    一九五三年十月十四日于北京
