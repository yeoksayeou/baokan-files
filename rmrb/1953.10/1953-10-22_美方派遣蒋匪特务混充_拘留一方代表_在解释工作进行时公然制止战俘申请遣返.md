Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 21st. Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who returned after the explanation process said that the so-called "detaining side representatives" in the explanation tents were actually Kuomintang special agents sent from Taiwan. They also said that these special agents had given them "lessons" on Jeju Island.

Among the thirty-two "detaining side representatives," as many as twenty-eight were Chiang Kai-shek special agents. General Li Xiangchao had already protested at the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 19th, opposing these Kuomintang special agents wearing American military uniforms coming to the explanation sites. Among these people, many spoke broken English, although they all adopted Western names like "Nelson" and "Healy" and claimed to be "American-born Chinese" or "mixed-race Chinese and Americans." General Li Xiangchao pointed out that these Chiang Kai-shek special agents openly threatened Chinese prisoners of war in the explanation sites, coercing them not to apply for repatriation. They are not qualified to be at the explanation sites because the Kuomintang bandit gang is not a belligerent party in the Korean War.

These prisoners of war who returned to the 31st camp in the Indian Custodial Camp last Thursday said that these Chiang Kai-shek special agents appeared as "instructors" in the third camp of the third POW camp on Jeju Island and gave the prisoners of war several "lessons." These special agents arrived on Jeju Island from Taiwan shortly after the Kuomintang bandit gang "visiting group" led by special agent leader Fang Zhi left Korea. These returned Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war said that U.S. Army Major Walter brought these special agents to the POW camp on September 4th. They arrived in Incheon on the same boat as the prisoners of war. These "instructors" openly told the prisoners of war that they were sent from Taiwan and that they went to the demilitarized zone to "help" the prisoners of war "fight the communist explanation personnel."

Zhang Mingqing, a Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war who returned after the explanation, said: "As soon as I entered the explanation tent, I recognized a Chiang Kai-shek special agent acting as a U.S. representative. His last name was Li. I don't know his first name because all the 'instructors' sent from Taiwan were only willing to tell us their last names. When he saw that I did not insult our explanation personnel, he looked very fierce towards me."

Another Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war, Lin Fengtang, said: "I also saw an 'instructor' who gave us lectures on Jeju Island, and he is now acting as a U.S. representative in an explanation tent. His last name is Wang, he is wearing a U.S. military uniform and a U.S. military hat with the letters 'U.N.' on it." Lin Fengtang continued: "While I was listening to the explanation, this Chiang Kai-shek special agent kept glaring at me threateningly. When I said I wanted to go home, he immediately jumped up and shouted at me: 'You must consider carefully.'"

Lin Fengtang continued: "This 'instructor' once said to us in a lecture on Jeju Island: 'When conducting screening in the demilitarized zone (U.S. special agents call explanation this), you have nothing to fear, because in addition to many Americans being present, Taiwan will also send fifty to sixty people to protect you.'" Currently, the number of Chiang Kai-shek special agents acting as "detaining side representatives," translators, and reporters is probably also around this number.

    美方派遣蒋匪特务混充“拘留一方代表”
    在解释工作进行时公然制止战俘申请遣返
    【新华社开城二十一日电】经过解释以后归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员说：在解释帐篷中的所谓“拘留一方代表”，实际上是台湾派来的国民党特务。他们还说：这些特务分子曾在济州岛上给他们上过“课”。
    在三十二名“拘留一方代表”中，竟有二十八名是蒋匪特务。李相朝将军已在十九日在军事停战委员会会议上提出抗议，反对这些穿着美国军服的国民党特务到解释场所里来。在这些人中间，有许多人说的是不三不四的英语，虽然他们都起了“奈尔逊”和“希利”这种洋名字，并且自称是“美籍华人”或“中美混血种”。李相朝将军指出，这些蒋匪特务在解释场所内公然威胁中国战俘，胁迫他们不要申请遣返。他们没有资格到解释场所里来，因为国民党匪帮不是朝鲜战争中交战的一方。
    上星期四从印度看管营地第三十一号营场回到开城来的这些战俘说，这些蒋匪特务曾在济州岛第三战俘营第三营场里以“教官”的名义出现，给战俘上过几堂“课”。这些特务分子是在特务头子方治所率领的国民党匪帮“慰问团”离开朝鲜以后不久，从台湾到达济州岛的。这些归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员说：美军少校华尔特在九月四日把这些特务分子领到战俘营里来。他们就和战俘乘同一只船到达仁川。这些“教官”公然对战俘说，他们是从台湾派来的，并且说，他们到非军事区去是为了“帮助”战俘“和共方解释人员进行斗争”。
    经过解释以后归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员张明清说：“我一进解释帐篷，就认出一个充当美方代表的蒋匪特务。这个人姓李。我不知道他叫什么名字，因为从台湾派来的所有‘教官’都只肯把他们的姓告诉我们。他看到我没有侮辱我们的解释人员，就对我表示很凶的样子。”
    另外一个中国人民志愿军被俘人员林凤堂说：“我也看到一个在济州岛给我们讲课的‘教官’，他现在在一个解释帐篷内充当美方的代表。他姓王，他穿着美国军服，戴着有‘U·N·’两个字的美军的帽子。”林凤堂接着说：“在我听取解释时，这个蒋匪特务一直瞪着眼威胁我。当我说，我要回家去的时候，他顿时跳起来向我嚷道：‘你必须慎重考虑’。”
    林凤堂继续说：“这个‘教官’有一次在济州岛给我们讲课时说：‘在非军事区进行甄别（美方特务是这样称呼解释的）的时候，你们没有什么可以害怕的，因为除了将有许多美国人在场以外，台湾也将派遣五十到六十个人前去保护你们’。”现在，充当“拘留一方代表”、翻译、和记者的蒋匪特务大约也是这个数字。
