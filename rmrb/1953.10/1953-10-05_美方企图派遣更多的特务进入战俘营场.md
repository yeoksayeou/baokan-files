Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th – The U.S. side, in order to strengthen the power of its spy elements within the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's custodial camps, is requesting the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to allow them to send more spies into the camps.

    Hamblen, head of the U.S. side's anti-repatriation group, wrote a letter to Major General Thorat, commander of the Indian custodial forces, on the 2nd, protesting the Indian forces' refusal to allow spy elements dispatched by the U.S. side, disguised in Christian, Catholic, and Buddhist garb, to visit the custodial camps. Hamblen's letter stated that these spy elements had previously preached "doctrine" to the prisoners of war in the U.S. POW camps. Hamblen demanded that the Indian forces "utilize" these spy elements.

    Our repatriated captured personnel have long exposed these U.S., Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang spy elements disguised in religious clothing. According to reports from returnees from the Chinese People's Volunteers, Zhou Jitai, Liu Guodong, Wang Ming, and others: as early as September 1951, when the U.S. side was using terrorist means to force prisoners of war to tattoo themselves, write blood letters, and join reactionary organizations, they dispatched U.S. spy Wu Boli, masquerading as a Christian "pastor," Rhee bandit spy Han Binghe, a U.S. spy masquerading as a Catholic "priest," and a Chiang bandit spy masquerading as a Buddhist "monk" to the POW camps to carry out the heinous act of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. These spy elements used starvation, beatings, and other tortures to force prisoners of war to convert. Many prisoners of war were forced to join all three religions simultaneously. They forced the prisoners of war to listen to their "doctrine" twice a week, which was actually intimidation and coercion to force the prisoners of war to tattoo themselves, write blood letters, and give up their right to repatriation. U.S. spy Wu Boli also frequently went to various camps to guide and inspect the Chiang and Rhee spies' activities in forcibly detaining prisoners of war, and to coerce and intimidate prisoners of war who were unwilling to tattoo themselves and write blood letters.

    Before the U.S. military authorities used violence to conduct "screening" of the 72nd POW camp on Koje Island on April 8, 1952, Wu Boli had given hundreds of knives with the inscription "U.S." on the handle to Wang Shunqing and Li Daan, the Chiang bandit spy ringleaders in this POW camp, instructing them to massacre prisoners of war who demanded repatriation. During the "screening," the "church" presided over by Wu Boli actually became an execution ground for persecuting and massacring prisoners of war. Chiang bandit spies Wang Shunqing and Li Daan openly imprisoned many prisoners of war who demanded repatriation in the "church," using various tortures to force them to give up their right to be repatriated. On the night of April 8, ninety-seven captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers were murdered in the "church."

    Now, Hamblen is attempting to dispatch these spy elements to the Neutral Nations custodial camps, the purpose of which is clearly to create more incidents that undermine the explanatory work in the camps, intensify the reign of terror over the captured personnel, in order to achieve what he calls a "victory" in the "psychological warfare" of preventing the repatriation of prisoners of war.

### 美方企图派遣更多的特务进入战俘营场

    美方企图派遣更多的特务进入战俘营场
    【新华社开城四日电】美方为了加强在中立国遣返委员会看管营场内的特务分子的力量，要求中立国遣返委员会允许他们派遣更多的特务到营场里去。
    美方反对遣返组组长汉布伦二日写信给印度看管部队司令托拉特少将，对印度部队不准美方派去的披着基督教、天主教和佛教外衣的特务分子访问看管营场，提出抗议。汉布伦的信上说，这些特务分子曾在美方战俘营为战俘们讲过“道”。汉布伦要求印度部队“利用”这些特务分子。
    遣返归来的我方被俘人员早已揭露了这些披着宗教外衣的美国、李承晚和蒋介石匪帮的特务分子。据中国人民志愿军归来人员周吉泰、刘国栋、王明等报告：早在一九五一年九月间，美方在用恐怖手段强迫战俘刺字、写血书和参加反动组织时，就派遣冒充基督教“牧师”的美国特务吴博礼、李匪特务韩秉赫、一个冒充天主教“神父”的美国特务，和一个冒充佛教“法师”的蒋匪特务到战俘营去进行强迫扣留战俘的罪恶活动。这些特务分子用不给饭吃、殴打和其他酷刑强迫战俘入教。有许多战俘被迫同时加入了三种教。他们强迫战俘每周听他们讲“道”两次，实际上是恫吓和胁迫战俘刺字、写血书和放弃被遣返的权利。美国特务吴博礼还经常到各个营里去，指导和检查蒋李特务强迫扣留战俘的活动，对不愿刺字和写血书的战俘进行胁迫和恫吓。
    一九五二年四月八日美军当局用暴力对巨济岛第七十二战俘营进行“甄别”以前，吴博礼曾把数百把柄上刻有“U．S．”字样的刀子，交给这个战俘营里的蒋匪特务头子王顺清和李大安，指使他们屠杀要求遣返的战俘。在“甄别”期间，吴博礼主持的“教堂”实际上成为迫害和屠杀战俘的刑场。蒋匪特务王顺清、李大安公然把许多要求遣返的战俘囚禁在“教堂”里，用各种酷刑强迫他们放弃被遣返的权利。四月八日夜里，就有九十七名中国人民志愿军被俘人员被杀害在“教堂”里。
    现在，汉布伦又企图把这些特务分子派遣到中立国看管营场去，其目的显然是为了在营场里制造更多的破坏解释工作的事件，加紧对被俘人员的恐怖统治，以取得他所说的阻止战俘遣返的“心理战”的“胜利”。
