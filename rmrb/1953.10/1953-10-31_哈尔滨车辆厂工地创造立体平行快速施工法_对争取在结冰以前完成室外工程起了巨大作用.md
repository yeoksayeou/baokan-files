The Seventh Engineering Team of the First Construction Engineering Company of Harbin City, at the Vehicle Repair Factory construction site, under the cooperation of engineer Wang Gui'an, Planning Section Chief Wang Jinliang, Technical Director Sun Yuxi, technician Bai Xirong, and workers Geng Shanfa, Bi Changlin, and others, absorbed the advanced experiences of Wang Senci's segmented assembly line operation and inclined support formwork, creating a three-dimensional parallel rapid construction method. In early October, the construction site used this method and it only took sixteen bricklayers eight and a half days to complete a three-story brick building of 320,000 bricks. Comparing only the speed of the bricklaying work, it exceeded the record set by Wang Senci's segmented assembly line method by one and a half times. This creation played a huge role in striving to complete outdoor projects ahead of schedule before freezing. The CPC Harbin Municipal Committee is now working with relevant departments to conduct a final assessment and summary of this advanced experience.

The biggest feature of this rapid construction method is that bricklaying, cement floor slab construction, and the installation of plumbing and heating equipment can be carried out simultaneously, overcoming the shortcomings of the general method of building one floor of bricks and then one floor of floor slabs, waiting for the cement floor slabs to be cured before building the second floor of bricks, which greatly shortens the construction period. The specific construction method is: after laying the foundation, all the inner and outer brick walls are built at once. After the bricklaying is completed, the floor slabs are constructed, and the plumbing and heating equipment are installed. Alternatively, after one floor is completed, the bricklaying can continue upwards, but at the same time, the first floor slab can be built using the inclined support formwork method, and the plumbing and heating equipment can be installed. In implementing this method, they encountered two technical problems: first, there was a conflict between building cement floor slabs and building bricks upwards—especially when building interior walls—making it difficult to carry out simultaneously. Second, it was difficult to integrate the floor slabs and the walls tightly. After research, they used the following three methods to overcome the above difficulties: first, after building all the bricks of the first floor, when building the floor slab, use the inclined support formwork method to enable the construction of the floor slab and the installation of plumbing and heating equipment to be carried out simultaneously. Second, when continuing to build the interior walls upwards, use hanging scaffolding to allow the continued upward building of interior walls without affecting the construction of the floor slabs. Third, when building inner and outer walls upwards, first leave the wall grooves for building the floor slabs, and place precast cement blocks with steel reinforcing ends in the grooves to ensure that the floor slabs and walls are tightly integrated. At this point, this construction method was basically declared successful.

According to the experience of the construction site, there are three issues that must be paid special attention to when using this method: first, a detailed ten-day construction plan must be formulated, because simultaneous operation of various types of work is very complicated, and if the combination is not good, it will affect the entire project. Second, rapid project record-keeping must be implemented to ensure that the situation is grasped at all times for dispatching and commanding. The construction site now reports the project situation to the workers four times a day—including how each group is doing. Third, timely and strict technical inspections must be carried out to ensure the quality of the project, because everyone is unfamiliar with the new method, and problems will occur if one is not careful.

The greatest advantage of this advanced experience is that in addition to ensuring the rapid completion of outdoor projects, it also turns the main outdoor project of the past—building cement floor slabs—into an indoor project, thus protecting the project from the influence of the seasons and turning it into a year-round project. This has a special effect on civil engineering construction in the Northeast region, where winter comes early.

    哈尔滨车辆厂工地创造立体平行快速施工法
    对争取在结冰以前完成室外工程起了巨大作用
    哈尔滨市第一建筑工程公司第七工程队车辆修理工厂工地，在工程师王贵安、计划科科长王金梁、技术主任孙玉玺、技术员白锡荣及工人耿善发、毕长林等人的合作下，吸取王孙慈分段流水作业及斜撑模板等先进经验，创造了立体平行快速施工法。十月上旬，该工地使用这种方法，以十六个砌砖工人八天半的时间砌完了一幢砌砖三十二万块的三层楼房。单以砌砖工程速度比较，超过了王孙慈分段流水作业法所创纪录一倍半。这一创造对争取在结冰前提前完成室外工程起了巨大作用。现中共哈尔滨市委正会同有关部门，对这一先进经验进行最后鉴定与总结。
    该快速施工法的最大特点是：砌砖、打水泥楼板、安水暖设备可同时进行，克服了一般的砌一层楼的砖打一层楼的楼板，等水泥楼板养生好了后再砌第二层楼砖的缺点，大大缩短了工期。其具体施工办法是：打好基础后，将全部内外砖墙一次砌完，待砌完砖后，再进行打楼板，以安装水暖设备。或在砌完一层楼后，仍往上砌砖，但同时以斜撑模板办法，开始打第一层楼板，以安装水暖设备。在实行这种办法中，他们碰到了两个技术问题：一是打水泥楼板和往上砌砖——特别是砌内墙时有矛盾，难以同时进行。二是楼板与墙难以结合得紧密。经过研究，他们用如下三个办法克服了上述困难：一、砌完第一层楼的全部砖后，再打楼板时，用斜撑模板法使打楼板与安装水暖设备同时进行。二、再继续往上砌内墙时，使用吊架脚手，使继续往上砌内墙，不影响打楼板。三、再往上砌内外墙时，先留下打楼板的壁槽，并在槽内放下带有钢筋头的预制水泥块，以保证楼板与墙壁结合得紧密。至此，此种施工法即宣告基本成功。
    据该工地的经验，在使用这种办法时，须特别注意三个问题：一、必须制订周密的旬日施工计划，因各工种同时作业非常复杂，如果结合不好就会影响整个工程。二、必须实行快速的工程记录，以保证随时掌握情况，进行调度指挥。现该工地已做到每日向工人报告四次工程情况——包括哪一个小组干得怎样。三、及时进行严格的技术检查，以保证工程质量，因为新办法大家不熟悉，一不注意就会出毛病。
    这一先进经验的最大长处是除保证了室外工程迅速完成以外，并使过去的主要室外工程——打水泥楼板变成室内工程，从而使工程免受季节的影响，变成跨年度的工程。这对于冬季来得较早的东北地区土木工程的施工，有着特殊作用。
