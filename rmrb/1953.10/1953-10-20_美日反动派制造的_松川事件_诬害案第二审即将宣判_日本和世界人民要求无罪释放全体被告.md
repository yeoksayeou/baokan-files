    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: The second instance verdict of the "Matsukawa Incident" frame-up case is scheduled to be announced on November 5th. Countless righteous people in Japan and around the world are demanding the acquittal of all innocent defendants – twenty patriotic Japanese workers.
    In the lead-up to the "Matsukawa Incident" verdict, the "Matsukawa Incident" Victim Relief Month campaign, organized by the Japan National Relief Association, is further intensifying. Slogans such as "Save the innocent 'Matsukawa Incident' defendants!" and "Don't let the tragedy of the Rosenbergs be repeated!" have resounded throughout Japan. According to incomplete statistics, approximately one thousand units of labor unions and mass organizations have participated in the movement to demand the acquittal of the "Matsukawa Incident" defendants and a fair trial. These include national labor unions such as the Japan National Railway Workers' Union, the Japan Private Railway Workers' Union Confederation, the Japan Coal Miners' Union, the Japan Teachers' Union, and the All Japan Metal Workers' Union, as well as labor union councils from Fukuoka and Yamagata Prefectures. The signature campaign demanding the acquittal of the innocent "Matsukawa Incident" defendants, originally targeting one million signatures, has already exceeded six million participants. In addition to the enthusiastic signing by union members, group signatures have reached 1.2 million, and individual signatures have reached 320,000, including many prominent social figures, scholars, and writers. Renowned Japanese writers Koji Uno and Kazuo Hirotsu recently published articles titled "Absurd Things" and "Truth Accuses" in the October issues of "Bungei Shunju" and "Chuo Koron" magazines, respectively, demanding that the "Matsukawa Incident" defendants be found innocent. They both conducted on-site investigations at the location of the "Matsukawa Incident" and unanimously concluded: "We cannot agree with the original trial's verdict under any circumstances."
    The verdict of the first instance trial of the "Matsukawa Incident" case on December 6, 1950, handed down by the judge under the direction of the US and Japanese reactionaries, has long been proven to be fabricated by nearly two hundred defense lawyers and legal scholars with various beliefs and positions. The first instance verdict was so absurd that even some Liberal Party members came forward to defend the defendants. Among the defense lawyers in the second instance trial are Joji Hakamada of the Yoshida Liberal Party, Sozaburo Suzuki of the Hatoyama Liberal Party, and Yonosuke Kikuchi of the right-wing Socialist Party. Hakamada Joji told a reporter from "Sankei Weekly": "After studying the record of the first instance, I was completely shocked. What shocked me was that the prosecutor demanded such a heavy sentence based on such insufficient evidence, and the judge actually accepted this demand and sentenced such a severe punishment." After pointing out the absurdity and unreliability of the so-called "evidence" against the defendants one by one, he said: "There is countless evidence to the contrary. … I can give you more evidence to the contrary. There are many suspicious points in the entire process of this trial."
    The despicable conspiracy of the US and Japanese reactionaries to fabricate the "Matsukawa Incident" and frame patriotic Japanese has long aroused the righteous indignation of upright people around the world. The Chinese People's Relief Association and the Chinese Railway Workers' Union and other people's organizations have repeatedly lodged serious protests with the Yoshida government and the presiding judge of the Sendai High Court of Japan, which is trying the "Matsukawa Incident," and donated funds to support the victimized Japanese patriots. The Land, Air and Sea Transport Workers' Trade Unions International, the Miners' Trade Unions International, and the Agricultural and Forestry Workers' Trade Unions International of the World Federation of Trade Unions, as well as the WFTU Liaison Bureau for Asia and Australia, have strongly protested the Yoshida government's conspiracy to frame patriotic Japanese workers on behalf of millions of workers worldwide. People's organizations from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Albania, the United States, France, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, and other countries have repeatedly lodged countless protests. According to incomplete statistics, since the "Matsukawa Incident" occurred, more than one hundred and several tens of thousands of protests have been lodged with the Yoshida government and Japanese courts, and many foreign organizations and individuals have also donated funds to support the defendants. International protests and support have given the victims of the "Matsukawa Incident" infinite encouragement.
    On August 17th, the fourth anniversary of the incident, all defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident" issued a statement expressing their determination to uphold the truth and strive for a fair verdict. Japanese and world public opinion are also demanding that the judges of the "Matsukawa Incident" listen to the voices of millions of people demanding the acquittal of all defendants and uphold justice and reason in the second instance verdict.

    美日反动派制造的“松川事件”诬害案第二审即将宣判
    日本和世界人民要求无罪释放全体被告
    【新华社十九日讯】东京消息：“松川事件”诬害案的第二审即将在十一月五日宣判。日本和全世界的无数正义人士都在要求无罪释放全体无辜被告——二十名日本爱国工人。
    在“松川事件”宣判的前夕，日本国民救援会所主持的“松川事件”被害者救援月运动正进一步高涨。“拯救无辜的‘松川事件’被告！”和“不准罗森堡夫妇的悲剧重演！”等口号，已响遍了日本全国。据不完全的统计，参加要求无罪释放“松川事件”被告和进行公正审判的运动的工会和群众团体，已有约一千个单位。其中有日本国营铁道工会、日本私营铁道工会总联合会、日本煤矿工会、日本教职员工会、全日本金属工会等全国性的工会以及福冈县和山形县的工会评议会等。原定以一百万人为目标的要求无罪释放“松川事件”无辜被告的签名运动，参加者也早已超过了六百万人。除了各工会会员踊跃签名外，团体签名达一百二十万人，个人签名也已达三十二万人，其中包括许多社会著名人士、学者、著作家。日本的著名作家宇野浩二与广津和郎最近分别在十月号的“文艺春秋”和“中央公论”杂志上发表了“荒诞的事情”和“真理在控诉”两篇文章，要求判决“松川事件”被告无罪。他们都曾数度到“松川事件”发生的现场去进行过实地调查，并一致得出结论说：“对于原审判决，无论如何不能同意。”
    一九五○年十二月六日“松川事件”案第一审的裁判官在美、日反动派的指使下作出的判决，早已经为近二百个各种不同信仰、不同立场的被告辩护律师和法学家证明是莫须有的。第一审的判决是如此荒谬，甚至一些自由党人也出来为被告辩护。在第二审的被告辩护律师中，包括吉田自由党人袴田重司、鸠山自由党人铃木惣三郎、右派社会党人菊池养之辅等。袴田重司曾向“产经周刊”记者发表谈话说：“我研究了第一审的纪录之后，完全大吃一惊。使我惊骇不置的是检察官竟依据这样极不充分的证据来要求处以如此的重刑，而法官竟然接受这种要求，判决这种严刑。”在一一指出被告的所谓“罪证”的荒谬和不可靠之后，他说：“反证是无数的。……我可以给你举出更多的反证来。这次审判的全部过程有很多令人怀疑的地方。”
    美、日反动派制造“松川事件”陷害日本爱国者的卑鄙阴谋，早就引起了世界各国正直人民的义愤。中国的中国人民救济总会和中国铁路工会等人民团体，曾多次向吉田政府和审讯“松川事件”的日本仙台高等裁判所审判长提出严重抗议，并捐款支援被害的日本爱国者。世界工会联合会的陆空运输工人工会国际、矿业工人工会国际和农林工人工会国际等以及世界工联亚澳联络局，曾代表全世界千百万工人强烈抗议吉田政府这一陷害日本爱国工人的阴谋。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、美国、法国、印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰等国的人民团体都曾先后不断提出无数次的抗议。据不完全的统计，自“松川事件”发生以来，向吉田政府和日本法院提出的抗议共达一百数十万次之多，许多的国外团体和个人还捐款支援被告。国际上的抗议和支援，给了“松川事件”被害者以无限的鼓舞。
    “松川事件”全体被告在八月十七日这个事件的四周年时发表声明，表示要坚持真理，争取公平判决。日本和全世界舆论也都在要求“松川事件”的裁判官倾听千百万人民的无罪释放全体被告的呼声，在第二审判决中使正义和公理得到申张。
