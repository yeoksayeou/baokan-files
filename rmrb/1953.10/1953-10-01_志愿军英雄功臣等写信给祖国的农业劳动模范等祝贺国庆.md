Volunteer Army First-Class Hero and Special-Class Meritorious Individual Hu Xiudao, Second-Class Hero and Special-Class Meritorious Individual Yi Caixue, the company where Special-Class Hero Huang Jiguang lived before his death, and all commanders and fighters of a certain unit defending Kaesong, etc., wrote letters to national agricultural labor models Li Shunda, cotton planting model Qu Yaoli, as well as workers and peasants and labor models at the Guanting Reservoir construction site and the Huai River harnessing construction site, etc., on the eve of National Day. They thanked them for their care and support for the Volunteer Army and warmly congratulated them on the fourth National Day of the motherland.

Hero Hu Xiudao said in his letter to Li Shunda: "Four years ago, I was still a poor child living like a beast of burden under the whip of the landlord. In the past four years, our motherland has undergone earth-shaking changes under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Not only have the peasants turned over from the exploitation and oppression of the landlords, but also many mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives have gradually emerged in the countryside, as well as collective farms. The agricultural production cooperative you lead is at the forefront of agricultural production with its excellent production results. On National Day, we earnestly hope that the motherland's agricultural production will have greater achievements, that there will be more grain year by year, and that mutual assistance and cooperation will advance steadily. We also congratulate you on your harvest."

Hero Yi Caixue, who attended the Second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation, said in his letter to cotton planting model Qu Yaoli: "In the days of fighting in the ice and snow, we wore warm and thick cotton military uniforms from the motherland and camped in the snow-covered mountains, or set off to fight in the cold night, and our hearts were always warm. We thank you and the farmers of the whole country from the bottom of our hearts for your care and support for us. This year is the first year of the motherland's first five-year plan for economic construction, and we believe that you will work with the farmers of the whole country to learn from the advanced production experience of the Soviet Union, strive for greater harvests, and enhance the motherland's economic strength."

All commanders and fighters of the company where Huang Jiguang lived before his death also wrote letters to the farmers of the motherland to celebrate National Day. They said in their letter:
"Every achievement in the construction of the motherland has brought us tremendous strength. We have only one wish: to build the motherland even better as soon as possible. We will definitely work hard to defend the motherland so that the motherland can smoothly transition to socialism peacefully."

A certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army defending Kaesong wrote letters to the workers and peasants at the Huai River construction site and the Guanting Reservoir construction site on the eve of National Day. The letter stated: "Many of our soldiers come from the banks of the Huai River and the Yongding River, and have suffered from floods in the past. Now, our hometowns have changed. When we receive good news from our relatives reporting the harvest, we all thank you for creating happiness for the people." The letter continued: "In the anti-aggression war in Korea, we repelled all the enemy's adventurous advances on the Kaesong front and many people have performed meritorious services. Although the armistice has been signed, we will never be paralyzed. We will definitely follow the instructions of the people of the motherland, vigilantly guard our positions, and fight to the end to defend the motherland and defend peace!"

Ma Xinnian, a second-class hero and special-class meritorious individual from the Huai River construction site, also wrote letters to Xie Hongyou, a special-class meritorious individual in harnessing the Huai River, and Li Xiuying, a first-class meritorious individual, to celebrate National Day, and hoped that they would achieve greater success in building the motherland.

    志愿军英雄功臣等写信给祖国的农业劳动模范等祝贺国庆
    中国人民志愿军一级英雄、特等功臣胡修道，二级英雄、特等功臣易才学，特级英雄黄继光烈士生前所在连队和保卫开城的某部的全体指挥员、战斗员等，在国庆前夕写信给祖国农业劳动模范李顺达、植棉模范曲耀离以及官厅水库工地、治淮工地上的工人农民和劳动模范等，感谢他们对志愿军的爱护和支援，并热烈祝贺祖国第四届国庆节。
    英雄胡修道在给李顺达的信上说：“四年前，我还是在地主的鞭子下过着牛马生活的穷孩子。四年来，我们祖国在毛主席的领导下经历了翻天覆地的变化，农民不但从地主的剥削和压迫下翻了身，而且农村里逐渐出现了许多互助组和农业生产合作社，还有集体农场。你所领导的农业生产合作社，更以优良的生产成绩走在农业生产的前头。在国庆节时，我们热切地希望祖国的农业生产有更大的成绩，粮食一年比一年多，互助合作稳步前进，并祝贺你们获得丰收。”
    曾经出席中华全国青年第二次代表大会的英雄易才学在给植棉模范曲耀离的信上说：“在冰天雪地的战斗日子里，我们穿着来自祖国的温暖厚实的棉军装露宿在积雪的山岭上，或是在寒夜里出发作战，我们心头总是暖和和的。我们从心里感谢你和全国农民对我们的爱护和支援。今年是祖国经济建设第一个五年计划的第一个年头，我们相信你一定会和全国农民一道，学习苏联先进的生产经验，争取更大的丰收，增强祖国的经济力量。”
    黄继光烈士生前所在连队全体指挥员、战斗员也给祖国的农民写信庆祝国庆。他们在信上说：
  “祖国建设中的每一个成就都给我们带来了巨大的力量。我们只有一个愿望：早日把祖国建设得更加美好。我们一定努力保卫祖国，使祖国平平安安地逐步过渡到社会主义。”
    保卫开城的中国人民志愿军某部，在国庆前夕写信给祖国淮河工地和官厅水库工地的工人和农民。信上说：“我们有许多战士来自淮河和永定河两岸，过去曾受过洪水的灾害，现在，我们的家乡变了样了，当我们收到亲人寄来报告丰收的喜讯时，都感谢你们为人民创造了幸福。”信上接着说：“在朝鲜反侵略战争中，我们在开城前线打退了敌人一切冒险进犯，并有许多人立了功。现在虽然停战了，我们决不麻痹，我们一定遵照祖国人民的嘱咐，警惕地严守阵地，为保卫祖国、保卫和平而奋斗到底！”
    来自淮河工地的二级英雄、特等功臣马新年也写信给治淮特等功臣谢洪友、甲等功臣李秀英庆祝国庆，并希望他们在建设祖国中获得更大的成绩。
