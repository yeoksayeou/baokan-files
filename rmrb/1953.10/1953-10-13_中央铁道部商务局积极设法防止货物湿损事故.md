    The Business Bureau of the Central Railway Ministry
    Actively Seeks Ways to Prevent Wet Damage to Goods
    The Business Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways writes: The "Reader's Letters Summary" column in the August 7th People's Daily published several letters from readers criticizing certain railway units for being irresponsible in grain transportation work, reflecting that wet damage accidents were quite serious in the months before August. Based on the analysis of the situation reflected by various parties, the reasons for the accidents are: leaders at all levels do not have sufficient understanding of the possibility of wet damage accidents during the rainy season, and only focus on completing transportation tasks while ignoring the integrity of the goods; at the same time, our bureau also failed to inspect and supervise, so that we could not correct the irresponsible phenomenon of on-site cargo transportation in time. At the National Railway Telephone Conference on August 7, we pointed out the hazards of these accidents to each railway administration; and deployed measures to prevent accidents. Later, we announced specific measures to prevent wet damage accidents in the "Railway Bulletin". Now, each railway administration is taking effective measures to prevent similar accidents, and our bureau is also checking the effect of the telephone conference and further improving the storage work in grain transportation.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央铁道部商务局
    积极设法防止货物湿损事故
    中央人民政府铁道部商务局来信：八月七日人民日报“读者来信摘要”栏刊载了读者批评某些铁路单位对粮食运输工作不负责任的几封来信，反映了八月以前的几个月，货物湿损事故相当严重。我们根据各方面反映的情况分析，产生事故的原因是：各级领导对雨季运输可能发生湿损事故的认识不足，只顾完成运输任务而忽视货物的完整无损；同时，我局又失于检查督促，以致未能及时纠正现场对货物运送的不负责现象。在八月七日全国铁路电话会议上，我们已向各管理局指出这些事故的危害性；并布置了防止事故的措施。以后又在“铁道公报”上公布了防止湿损事故的具体办法。现在各铁路管理局正采取有效措施防止类似事故，我局也正检查电话会议的效果，进一步改进粮食运输中的保管工作。
