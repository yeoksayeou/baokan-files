    The Ministry of Commerce convened a conference of all staff members of its affiliated specialized general corporations in late September to arrange for the work of increasing production and practicing economy. Under the leadership of local Party committees, state-owned commercial enterprises in various regions are also actively carrying out the work of increasing production and practicing economy. It is very important and necessary to carry out the work of increasing production and practicing economy in state-owned commerce.
    From January to mid-September, the state-owned commercial system only completed a little over 50% of the annual purchase and sales plan. Now, with only a little over three months left until the end of the year, it is necessary to exert the greatest effort to complete the annual purchase and sales plan. There are also many shortcomings in the execution of the financial plan. The amount of profits that should have been turned over in June, July, and August is very large. In August, the amount of profits turned over to the treasury only accounted for about 32% of the total amount due. Furthermore, some comrades in the commercial sector are developing a tendency to neglect the importance of saving expenses and profits, which needs to be further corrected. Now that the autumn harvest season has arrived, most regions have had a bumper harvest this year, except for some disaster-stricken areas. At the same time, the amount of investment in capital construction in urban industrial and mining areas in the second half of the year is even greater than in the first half, and the total purchasing power of the people will be higher than last year. The market capacity after autumn will be further expanded. State-owned commercial departments must actively expand commodity circulation in order to meet the needs of production and consumption. Therefore, in order to strive to complete and overfulfill the annual purchase and sales plan, to adapt to the market needs after autumn, and to strive to complete the capital accumulation plan, it is very important and necessary to carry out the work of increasing production and practicing economy in state-owned commerce.
    The first and most important step in carrying out the work of increasing production and practicing economy in state-owned commerce is to actively expand purchase and sales. In recent months, state-owned commercial enterprises have made progress in expanding sources of goods, gradually expanding the work of exclusive sales and agency sales of state-owned and local state-owned industrial products, and also expanding the processing and ordering of private industrial products. In the future, purchases should be made according to plan to ensure an adequate supply of most commodities necessary for the people, and on this basis, special emphasis should be placed on expanding sales in a planned manner. Because according to the sales situation in the third quarter, only 57.57% of the quarterly plan was completed, and commodities that need to be vigorously promoted, such as cloth, only completed 53% of the quarterly plan, further efforts are needed to complete the annual sales plan. The phenomenon that some enterprises only pay attention to actively organizing sources of goods while neglecting active sales should be changed. It should be known that actively purchasing goods is precisely for the purpose of selling goods. In addition, it is now the season when agricultural products are being marketed in large quantities, and the industrial sector is also launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy. In order to meet the needs of farmers and expand the market for industrial products, it is necessary to actively expand sales. Only by actively expanding sales can we further strengthen the leadership of state-owned commerce over the market, stimulate the urban and rural economy, thereby expanding tax sources, increasing national income, and ensuring the completion of the state's plan for the purchase of agricultural products. These are the main tasks of the current work of increasing production and practicing economy in state-owned commerce.
    In carrying out the work of increasing production and practicing economy in state-owned commerce, attention should also be paid to saving commodity circulation costs. This is an important way to complete the profit turnover plan and accumulate funds for national construction. State-owned commercial enterprises should seek reasonable profits in their operations; however, there is a fundamental difference between the operating purpose of state-owned commercial enterprises and the profit-seeking operating purpose of private commercial enterprises. State-owned commercial enterprises bear the important responsibility of serving production and consumers, leading the market, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. Therefore, state-owned commercial enterprises must maintain huge institutions, maintain reasonable reserves, and bear greater interest payments. Under these circumstances, in order to ensure profitable operation, it is especially important to speed up commodity circulation and capital turnover and reduce costs as much as possible. At present, the commodity circulation costs of state-owned commercial enterprises are very high. According to calculations by the Ministry of Commerce, it was 16.27% of net sales in 1951 and 15.9% of net sales in 1952. If, according to the current level of operation, assuming that the total sales amount in the next five years is 10 million trillion yuan, if the commodity circulation cost rate can be gradually reduced to 11.15% by 1957, then about 22 million trillion yuan can be saved for the country. What a considerable amount this is!
    In order to do a good job in increasing production and practicing economy in state-owned commerce, state-owned commerce should fundamentally improve its existing management level. This requires doing a lot of work. First of all, we should do a good job in studying the needs of residents. Malenkov said in his report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "Trade organizations still rarely study the needs of residents," "In some places, they do not serve buyers well." This situation also exists in our country's commercial work today, so it shows great blindness in management. For example, state-owned commercial enterprises in some areas blindly ask big cities for "famous brands" regardless of the needs of local residents, resulting in high-end consumer goods that cannot be sold, while commodities urgently needed by local residents are seriously out of stock. After commercial departments purchase goods, they should quickly bring the goods to consumers so as to supply the needs of consumers in a timely manner. However, some commercial workers think that "everything is fine" after the goods are transported into the warehouse. Last year, the Shenyang Department Store Wholesale Station had a backlog of nine train cars of woolen sweaters, but the majority of consumers could not buy woolen sweaters anywhere in the cold winter season, causing spiritual and material pain and losses to the majority of consumers. In commodity transfer, there have also been lessons of "mosquito nets arriving in autumn" and "winter gloves arriving in December" due to untimely transportation and improper transfer. In-depth understanding of the needs of residents is an important task of state-owned commerce. This work is related to the planning of industrial and agricultural production, the development of state-owned commerce, and the supply to the market. All staff members of state-owned commercial departments should realize that doing a good job in studying the needs of residents is the basis for doing a good job in commercial work, so as to strive to improve shortcomings and avoid blindness in management, so as to better serve production and consumers.
    In order to do a good job in increasing production and practicing economy in state-owned commerce, it is also necessary to further improve commodity distribution, transportation, and adjustment, strengthen the internal and external connections within the enterprise, and overcome phenomena such as "backlog here and out of stock there" and "warehouse backlog and store out of stock" in commodity distribution. In addition to strengthening the control and adjustment of purchase, sales, and inventory by the general companies and provincial and municipal companies to reduce blindness, it is also necessary to promote the concept of the whole, exchange information, and support each other; the internal connection of enterprises should be strengthened, closely combined, so that the organized goods can be smoothly supplied to consumers.
    State-owned commerce must also rely on cooperatives and closely integrate with cooperatives. Cooperatives have a broad mass base and are powerful assistants to state-owned commerce. State-owned commercial departments must help and support the work of cooperatives in specific business, earnestly implement the preferential rates stipulated by the state, and give priority to cooperatives in purchasing goods. Cooperatives at all levels should, under the leadership of state-owned commerce, supply the needs of their members, promote local and special products, and actively help the country complete the plan for the purchase of grain and major raw materials and export materials.
    State-owned commerce in various regions must also rely on the leadership of local Party committees and frequently report the work to the local Party and government leading organs so that the Party committee can further strengthen the leadership of state-owned commerce and correctly implement the Party's commercial policy.
    The tasks facing state-owned commercial workers are arduous, but as long as leaders at all levels can fully mobilize and rely on employees, the work of increasing production and practicing economy can be carried out smoothly. We should see that the political consciousness of the majority of employees has been raised in the past four years, and as long as they are given correct leadership, their work enthusiasm can be fully exerted. When mobilizing employees, we should pay attention to overcoming the bureaucracy of only being busy with assigning tasks without explaining policies, and being busy with arranging without in-depth inspection. This is a problem that should be paid close attention to when leading state-owned commerce to increase production and practice economy.

### 积极开展国营商业增产节约工作

    积极开展国营商业增产节约工作
    中央商业部在九月下旬举行了所属各专业总公司全体职工大会，布置增产节约工作；各地国营商业在当地党委领导下，也正在积极开展增产节约工作。在国营商业中开展增产节约工作是十分重要的，也是十分必要的。
    国营商业系统一月至九月中旬，只完成全年购销计划的百分之五十多。现在到年终只有三个多月，因此，完成全年购销计划尚须尽最大的努力。财务计划执行中的缺点也不少。六、七、八三个月应缴未缴利润的数额很大，八月份上缴利润已入库的只占应缴总额的百分之三十二左右，而商业部门中某些同志忽视节约费用的观点与忽视利润的观点正在滋长，这也待继续予以纠正。现在，秋收旺季已到，今年农作物除部分受灾地区外，大部地区还是丰收；同时，城市工矿区基本建设下半年投资数量更大于上半年，人民总购买力将比去年有所提高，秋后市场容纳量将进一步扩大，国营商业部门必须积极扩大商品流通，才能满足生产与消费的需要。因此，为了争取完成与超额完成全年购销计划，为了适应秋后市场需要，为了力求完成资金积累计划，在国营商业中开展增产节约工作就显得十分重要和必要。
    在国营商业中开展增产节约工作首先和主要的一环，是积极扩大购销。国营商业近几个月来在扩大货源工作方面有了进步，逐步扩大了对国营与地方国营工业产品的包销与代销工作，也扩大了对私营工业产品的加工订货。今后就应按计划进货，以保证绝大多数为人民所必需的商品的充分供应，并在此基础上特别着重有计划地扩大推销。因为从第三季度销售情况来看，仅完成季度计划的百分之五十七点五七，须大力推销的商品如布匹，只完成季度计划的百分之五十三，所以，完成全年销售计划有待进一步努力。目前有些企业只注意积极组织货源而放松积极推销的现象应该加以改变，须知积极进货正是为了销货。加以目前正是农产品大量上市季节，工业部门也正展开增产节约竞赛，为了满足农民需要和为工业产品扩大市场，都必须积极扩大推销。也只有积极扩大了推销，才能进一步加强国营商业对市场的领导，活跃城乡经济，从而扩大了税源，增加国家收入，并保证国家收购农产品计划的完成。这些，就是国营商业当前增产节约工作的主要任务。
    在国营商业中开展增产节约工作，还应当注意节约商品流转费用。这是为完成利润上缴计划，为国家建设积累资金的重要途径。国营商业在经营中应当求得合理利润；但国营商业经营目的和私营商业经营目的之唯利是图有原则的区别。国营商业担负着为生产和消费者服务、领导市场和巩固工农联盟的重大责任，所以，国营商业必须维持巨大的机构，保持合理的储备，负担着更大的利息支付额。在这种情况下，为了保证经营的有利，尽量加速商品流转和资金周转，降低费用就更有着特殊的重要性。目前国营商业的商品流转费用是很高的，根据中央商业部计算，一九五一年为纯销货额的百分之一十六点二七，一九五二年为纯销货额的百分之一十五点九。如果按照现在的经营水平，假定今后五年内销货总额以一千万亿元计算，商品流转费用率若能够逐渐降低，到一九五七年降为百分之十一点一五的话，那末，就可为国家节约费用二十二万亿元左右。这是一笔多么可观的数目啊！
    为做好国营商业中的增产节约工作，国营商业应该从根本上提高现有的经营水平。这需要做好很多工作。首先应该做好研究居民需要的工作。马林科夫在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告中说：“贸易机关仍然很少研究居民的需要”、“在某些地方，没有很好地为购买者服务”。我国商业工作中，今天也正存在着这种情况，因此在经营上表现出很大的盲目性。譬如，有些地区的国营商业不根据当地居民的需要，盲目地向大城市要“名牌货”，结果运来的高级消费品销不掉，而当地居民迫切需要的商品却严重脱销。商业部门购进商品以后，应该迅速使商品和消费者见面，以便及时供应消费者需要。但有些商业工作人员把商品运进仓库后却认为“万事大吉”。去年沈阳百货批发站就曾积压了九个火车厢的绒衣，而广大消费者在天寒地冻的季节里到处奔走却买不到绒衣，使广大消费者在精神上、物质上遭受痛苦和损失。在商品调运中，由于运输不及时和调运不适当，也有过“秋来蚊帐到”“十二月来防寒手套”的教训。深入地了解居民需要是国营商业的一项重要工作，这一工作关系到工农业生产的计划性，关系到国营商业的发展以及对市场的供应，国营商业部门全体工作人员应认识：做好研究居民需要工作，是做好商业工作的依据，从而努力改进缺点，避免经营中的盲目性，以便更好地为生产和消费者服务。
    为了作好国营商业的增产节约工作，还必须进一步改善商品分配、运输、调剂工作，加强企业中上下内外的联系，克服商品分布中的“此处积压彼处脱销”、“仓库积压门市脱销”等现象。各总公司、省市公司除应加强对购、销、存情况的掌握与调剂以减少盲目性外，还必须提倡整体观念，互通情况，互相支援；企业内部更要加强相互联系，紧密结合，使组织好的商品能顺畅地供应到消费者手里。
    国营商业还必须依靠合作社，密切与合作社的结合。合作社有广大群众基础，是国营商业的有力的助手。国营商业部门必须在具体业务中帮助和扶植合作社的工作，必须切实贯彻国家规定的优待率，并予合作社购货的优先权。而各级合作社应该在国营商业的领导下，供应社员们的需要，推销土、特产，积极帮助国家完成收购粮食及主要原料和出口物资计划。
    各地国营商业还必须依靠各地党委领导，经常向当地党政领导机关请示报告工作情况，以便党委进一步加强对国营商业的领导，正确贯彻党的商业政策。
    摆在国营商业工作者面前的任务是繁重的，但只要各级领导能充分发动职工，依靠职工，增产节约工作就能顺利地进行。我们应该看到：广大职工四年来政治觉悟提高了，只要给予正确领导，工作积极性就能充分发挥。在发动职工时，要注意克服那种只忙于交代任务而不说明政策、忙于布置而不深入检查的官僚主义，这是领导国营商业增产节约时应十分注意的一个问题。
