　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: TASS and Dian Tong News Agency reported: The Executive Committee of the International Association of Journalists held a meeting in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, from the 16th to the 18th. The meeting concluded with the complete victory of those who support peace, progress, and freedom of the press. After the Association's Secretary-General, Ronik, reported on the work of the Executive Committee, the meeting began a debate. The head of the Soviet delegation, Zaslavsky, pointed out in his speech the enormous role of newspapers in the struggle against warmongers and the possibility of the International Association of Journalists fulfilling its tasks in this regard. He also condemned the attempts by international reactionaries to weaken the International Association of Journalists, such as the American Newspaper Guild's continuous failure to pay membership fees and attempts to force the International Association of Journalists to implement the Marshall Plan. The Hungarian representative also strictly criticized the Executive Committee for not making sufficient efforts in the struggle against warmongers and put forward a draft resolution on the Secretary-General's report, urging journalists of all countries to use newspapers to fight against propaganda for a new war. This proposal was unanimously adopted. When the meeting debated the Soviet delegation's proposal against warmongers, the US representative, Martin, said he could not listen to such condemnation and left the meeting alone. The meeting passed this proposal by a majority vote, and also passed the Soviet delegation's proposal to safeguard the rights of journalists from political persecution.

　　国际新闻记者协会执委会决议
    敦促各国新闻工作者  利用报纸反对战争贩子
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】塔斯社与电通社报导：国际新闻记者协会执委会，于十六日至十八日在匈牙利首都布达佩斯举行，会议已在拥护和平、进步与新闻自由人士的完全胜利中宣告结束，在协会秘书长罗尼科报告执委会的工作后，会议展开辩论。苏联代表团团长萨斯拉夫斯基在发言中指出报纸在反对战争贩子斗争中的巨大作用和国际新闻记者协会在完成这方面任务的可能性，并斥责国际反动派企图削弱国际新闻记者协会的行为，例如美国记者公会的延不断纳会费，并企图强使国际新闻记者协会奉行马歇尔计划。匈牙利代表亦严格批评执委会在反对战争贩子的斗争中未作足够的努力，并提出了关于秘书长报告的决议草案，敦促各国的新闻工作者利用报纸为反对新战争宣传而斗争。该案获得一致通过。当会议辩论苏联代表团所提反对战争贩子的议案时，美国代表马丁说他不能听取这种谴责，孤零零地离开了会场。会议以大多数票通过了这一议案，并通过了苏联代表团所提的保障新闻工作者权利免受政治迫害的议案。
