　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. A person in charge of the CCP Central Committee commented on China's military situation, saying: We have now entered a new turning point, that is, the balance of power between the two sides of the war has undergone a fundamental change. The People's Liberation Army not only has long held an advantage in quality, but also now has an advantage in quantity. This is a sign that the success of the Chinese revolution and the realization of peace in China are approaching. At the end of the second year of the war, that is, at the end of June this year, the total number of Kuomintang troops was about 3.65 million. Compared with the 4.3 million when the Kuomintang launched a nationwide civil war in July 1946, this number is 650,000 less. This is because although the Kuomintang was annihilated, captured, or deserted about 3.09 million people in the two years of the war (of which 2.64 million were annihilated or captured), the Kuomintang supplemented about 2.44 million people during this period, so the shortage was only 650,000. Recently, a sudden change has occurred. After the first four months of the third year of the war, that is, from July 1st to November 2nd when Shenyang was liberated, it lost one million people. The Kuomintang's replenishment situation in the four months has not yet been determined. Assuming it can replenish 300,000 people, the shortage is 700,000. In this way, the total number of Kuomintang troops, including its army, navy, air force, regular army, non-regular army, combat troops, and logistics organs, is now only about 2.9 million. The People's Liberation Army, on the other hand, has increased from 1.2 million in June 1946 to 2.8 million in June 1948, and now it has increased to more than 3 million. This situation has caused the Kuomintang army's long-term quantitative advantage to rapidly turn into a disadvantage. This is the result of the heroic battles of the People's Liberation Army on all fronts across the country in the past four months, especially the Suiqi Campaign, the Jinan Campaign in the south, and the Jinzhou, Changchun, Liaoxi, and Shenyang Campaigns in the north. The Kuomintang's regular army, because it desperately incorporated non-regular troops into the regular army, still had the numbers of 285 divisions by the end of June this year. In the four months, the People's Liberation Army annihilated a total of 83 divisions above the battalion level, including 63 complete divisions. This has greatly shortened the war process we originally estimated. It was originally estimated that it would take about five years from July 1946 to fundamentally overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary government. Now it seems that it will only take about one year from now to fundamentally overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary government. As for eliminating reactionary forces in all parts of the country and completing the people's liberation, it will still take more time. The enemy is collapsing rapidly, but it still requires the Communist Party members, the People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life across the country to unite and work harder to finally and completely eliminate the reactionary forces and establish a unified, democratic, and people's republic throughout the country.

　　中共中央负责人评论中国军事形势
    根本上打倒国民党反动政府
    从现时起只需一年左右时间
    【新华社陕北十四日电】中共中央负责人评中国军事形势称：现已进入一新的转折点，即战争双方力量对比已经发生了根本的变化。人民解放军不但在质量上早已占有优势，而且在数量上现在也已经占有优势。这是中国革命的成功和中国和平的实现已经迫近的标志。国民党军在战争的第二年底，即今年六月底，总数约计尚有三百六十五万人。这个数目，对于一九四六年七月国民党开始发动全国性内战时期的四百三十万人来说，是少了六十五万人。这是由于国民党在两年战争中虽然被歼被俘和逃亡了大约三百零九万人（其中被歼被俘为二百六十四万人），但因国民党在此期内补充了约二百四十四万人，故亏短数尚只有六十五万人。最近则起了一个突变。经过战争第三年度的头四个月，即今年七月一日至十一月二日沈阳解放时，它即丧失了一百万人。四个月内国民党补充情形尚未查明，假定它能补充三十万人，亏短数为七十万人。这样国民党全军包括它的陆海空军正规军非正规军作战部队和后勤机关都在内，它现在只有二百九十万左右的人数。人民解放军，则由一九四六年六月的一百二十万人，增至一九四八年六月的二百八十万人，现在则又增至三百余万人。这种情况，就使国民党军在数量上长期占有的优势，急速地转入了劣势。这是由于四个月内全国各战场人民解放军英勇作战的结果，而特别是南线的睢杞战役、济南战役，北线的锦州、长春、辽西、沈阳诸战役的结果。国民党的正规军，因为它拚命地将非正规军编入正规军内，至今年六月底尚有二百八十五个师的番号。四个月内，即被人民解放军歼灭了营以上部队合计共八十三个师，其中包括六十三个整师。这样，就使我们原来预计的战争进程，大为缩短。原来预计，从一九四六年七月起，大约需要五年左右时间，便可能从根本上打倒国民党反动政府。现在看来，只需从现时起，再有一年左右的时间，就可能将国民党反动政府从根本上打倒了。至于在全国一切地方消灭反动势力，完成人民解放，则尚需较多的时间。敌人是正在迅速崩溃中，但尚需共产党人、人民解放军和全国各界人民团结一致，加紧努力，才能最后地完全地消灭反动势力，在全国范围内建立统一的民主的人民共和国。
