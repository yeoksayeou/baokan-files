    [Taihang Electricity] Since late September, locusts and grasshoppers have appeared in 21 districts of six counties in the First, Fifth, and Sixth Special Districts. The situation has worsened in various places since October. According to incomplete statistics, more than 30 districts and 500 villages in ten counties, including Lincheng, Neiqiu, Zanhuang in the First Special District, Xiangyuan in the Second Special District, Linxian, Anyang, Tangyin in the Fifth Special District, and Wu'an, Cixian, Shahe in the Sixth Special District, have been widely affected by grasshoppers and locusts. In Wu'an, the affected area has expanded from three districts to five districts, with the affected area reaching more than 42,000 mu, and more than 20 qing of wheat seedlings have been eaten. In Linxian, the pest has already spread to a large area of more than 65,000 mu in the 8th and 9th districts alone, and in some areas, the wheat that was replanted for the second time was eaten up after emergence. In Dujiazhuang and Caojiazhuang in the Tenth District of Wu'an, many locusts that had been beaten down during wheat planting were found again after the recent wheat planting. At present, in addition to grasshoppers and locusts eating wheat seedlings, mole crickets have also appeared in some areas of Neiqiu and Xiangyuan counties, which are also seriously harming wheat seedlings. In the 1st, 3rd, and 7th districts of Xiangyuan, patches of wheat seedlings have been damaged. After the leading comrades personally participated and overcame various waiting and paralyzing thoughts of the cadres and masses, various places organized the masses to carry out a pest eradication and locust control campaign to protect wheat seedlings. In Wu'an County, grasshoppers have been basically eliminated in most villages. In the Tenth District, under the personal deployment, organization, and leadership of County Head Zhang, the entire district mostly eradicated the pests within four days. After locusts appeared in more than 30 villages in the 1st, 2nd, and 4th districts of Lincheng, County Party Secretary Li Qingtai personally went to Chengdi Village in the First District to organize the capture and beating. The whole county also launched a pest eradication, wheat protection, and replanting campaign. In the Third District of Anyang, under the leadership of the District Party Secretary and other cadres, more than 700 village cadres and masses divided into several routes to encircle and suppress the grasshoppers in the central area of six villages. Shahe, Cixian and other places, which did not pay much attention to pest eradication beforehand, have also launched capture and beating campaigns.
