Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Reports from various sources: The President of the Third UN General Assembly, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, and UN Secretary-General Lie, on November 13th, separately sent letters to the leaders of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, requesting the four countries to hold direct negotiations to resolve the Berlin issue, thereby opening the way for the conclusion of peace treaties with Germany, Austria, and Japan. The head of the Soviet delegation to the UN General Assembly, Vyshinsky, on November 16th, on behalf of the Soviet government, replied to Evatt and Lie, expressing agreement with their suggestions. Vyshinsky's reply stated: "The Soviet government shares the same opinion as you, that the resolution of the Berlin issue will have a positive significance for resolving issues such as the peace treaties with Germany, Austria, and Japan. The Soviet government also agrees with you that personal contact and mutual trust between the leaders of the countries are of great significance for improving relations." (TASS)

However, officials from the United States, Britain, and France, who are persisting in their aggressive policies, rejected the suggestions of Evatt and Lie. Marshall, McNair, and Schuman, after meeting in Paris on the 16th, issued separate replies on the 17th, insisting on refusing direct negotiations with the Soviet Union before the so-called "Berlin blockade" is lifted. This stance of the three Western countries in rejecting agreement has once again exposed their aggressive face to public opinion.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: TASS, New York, 16th: On the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship Associations issued a statement by seventy-one prominent scientists, writers, artists, and pastors calling for the reconstruction of American-Soviet cooperation. The statement pointed out that fifteen years ago, President Roosevelt expressed the highest hope of the American people, that American-Soviet relations would remain normal and friendly. This confidence of Roosevelt's has been confirmed by years of fruitful cooperation between the two countries, which reached its climax in the common victory over fascism. The statement stressed, we believe that if our leaders recall the spirit of Roosevelt and the Soviet Union seeking agreement in 1933, they will do better, because we firmly believe that such a situation can be reached today. "Today, we recall with gratitude the actions of the statesmen who brought about friendly relations between our two countries in 1933, and we now demand the reconstruction of cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union. We call upon the American people to unite and demand that the President and the Secretary of State resume negotiations with the Soviet Union to resolve the differences between our two countries."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Not long ago, Washington columnist Coffin asserted that Truman might personally go to Europe to meet with Stalin before the opening of the new Congress. Coffin's article has aroused a widespread desire for peace in the United States and Western Europe, which have long been shrouded in the war propaganda of American imperialist war-mongers and their spokesmen. However, Marshall, one of the American foreign policy makers who is artificially creating international tension, after hearing this inference in the American newspapers and the widespread desire for peace it aroused, immediately denied it on the 12th, saying that it was "a Soviet peace propaganda offensive, with the clear intention of weakening the United States." This slander by Marshall was refuted by Stone, a reporter for the New York Star. Stone wrote: "Marshall accuses the Soviet Union of launching a peace propaganda offensive. This is a strange accusation. Don't we want peace? Until now, the Soviet Union has been accused of conspiring to carry out aggression, but now it is accused of plotting peace." The newspaper, after pointing out that American soldiers and bankers have repeatedly prevented efforts for direct negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union, also stated: Peace efforts seem more frightening to the Department of the Army than the atomic bomb. Stone asked: Why are Marshall, Forrestal, and Lovett so afraid of the appearance of peace? The British Daily Worker, commenting on the above-mentioned rumors in the American newspapers, stated: It would be a serious mistake if people passively predict the possibility of Truman taking new actions in foreign policy. "The decisive factor in blocking the path of war-mongers is always the tireless struggle of the people."

### 苏联函复伊瓦特与莱氏　同意四国谈判柏林问题  美英法固执侵略政策竟拒绝协议

　　苏联函复伊瓦特与莱氏
  　同意四国谈判柏林问题
    美英法固执侵略政策竟拒绝协议
    【新华社陕北二十日电】各方报导：第三届联合国大会主席澳外长伊瓦特及联合国秘书长莱氏，于十一月十三日分别致函苏美英法四国领袖，要求四国举行直接谈判，解决柏林问题，借以打开缔结对德、奥、日和约的途径。苏出席联大代表团长维辛斯基于十六日奉苏联政府之命，函复伊、莱二氏，对二氏建议表示同意。维氏复函称：“苏联政府与阁下持有相同意见，即柏林问题的解决，将对解决德、奥、日和约等问题具有积极的意义。关于各国领袖间的亲自接触与互信，对改进关系具有重大意义一点，苏联政府与阁下所见亦同。”（塔斯社）
    但固执侵略政策的美英法三国官方人士，则拒绝了伊、莱两人的建议。马歇尔、麦克奈尔与舒曼，在十六日于巴黎集议后，已于十七日分别发出复文，坚持所谓在“柏林封锁”解除之前，拒绝与苏联直接谈判。西方三国这种拒绝协议的立场，又一次将它们的侵略面貌，暴露于舆论之前。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社纽约十六日讯：值兹美苏建立外交关系十五周年之际，美苏友谊协会全国委员会发表七十一位著名科学家、作家、艺术家与牧师代表要求重建美苏合作的声明。声明指出，十五年前，罗斯福总统表示出美国人民的最高希望，即苏美关系将仍是正常与友谊的。罗斯福的这种信心，已为以后数年两国间有成果的合作所证实，这种合作在战胜法西斯的共同胜利中达到最高点。该声明力称，我们相信，如果我国的领袖回忆起一九三三年罗斯福与苏联求得协议的那种精神，他们会做得好一些，因为我们深信今天也能达到那种地步。“今天，我们以感谢的心情回想起使我们两国于一九三三年达成友谊关系的那种政治家的行动，我们现在要求美苏间重建合作。我们要求美国人民联合一致要求总统和国务卿与苏联恢复谈判，以解决我们两国的分歧。”
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】不久以前，华盛顿专栏作家科芬著文断言杜鲁门在新国会开幕前，或将亲自赴欧与斯大林会谈。科芬的文章，使许久以来即为美帝国主义战争贩子及其代言人的战争宣传所笼罩的美国及西欧各地，普遍地掀起了和平的渴望。但是，正在人为地制造国际紧张气氛的美国外交决策人之一的马歇尔，在听到美国报纸这一推断及其所激起的广泛和平愿望后，连忙于十二日否认，并说它是“苏联的和平宣传攻势，含意显在削弱美国的地位”。马氏这一诬蔑，遭到了纽约明星报记者史东的驳斥。史东写道：“马歇尔责备苏联发动和平宣传攻势。这是奇怪的责备。我们难道不想要和平吗？直到现在为止，苏联一直被责备阴谋进行侵略，可是现在又责备它阴谋策划和平了。”该报在指出美国军人和银行家曾一再阻止美苏直接谈判的努力后又称：和平努力对于陆军部似乎比原子弹更可怕。史东问道：马歇尔、福莱斯特尔和罗维特究竟为什么这样害怕和平的出现呢？英国工人日报在评论美报上述传说时称：如果人们消极地预卜杜鲁门在外交政策上采取新行动的可能性，那将犯严重的错误。“阻断战争贩子道路的决定因素，无论如何总是人民不疲倦的斗争”。
