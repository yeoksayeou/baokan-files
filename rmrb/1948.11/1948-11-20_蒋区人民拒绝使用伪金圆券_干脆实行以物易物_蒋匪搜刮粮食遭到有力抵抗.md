Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Comprehensive reports indicate that people in Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas have universally refused to use the wildly devalued counterfeit Gold Yuan as a means of exchange and payment. Citizens of Hankou have long used silver dollars as currency, and the refusal to use counterfeit Gold Yuan is common in counties and villages of Hubei. The Kuomintang Hubei Provincial Government was so flustered that it hastily issued an order to ban it. Some areas have simply resorted to bartering. Farmers in the four suburban counties of Shanghai refuse to accept "credit that is close to non-existent Gold Yuan" (Associated Press), but demand kerosene, matches, and soap in exchange for their grain. Even the advertisement fees for the Fenghua Daily in Zhejiang openly demand a price of three catties of rice per inch. Professors and workers in Beiping and Shanghai, when holding anti-hunger strikes and strikes against teaching, demanded increased food rations and refused to accept food subsidies, loans, and salary increases calculated in Gold Yuan. Therefore, "all the compromises reached so far in the strikes of public utilities and transportation systems in Shanghai are not based on money but on rice" (Associated Press, 10th). This situation has forced Tian Yushi, the Kuomintang Deputy Minister of Food, to admit: "The people value goods more than money and do not trust the Gold Yuan."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. Comprehensive reports indicate that at a time when the Kuomintang reactionary government is causing severe food shortages in its controlled areas, it is intensifying its seizure of grain from the people. In addition to the approximately 60 million shi that are already being extorted under the "punishment" measure, the Nanjing clique held an "emergency grain meeting" on the 13th, deciding to "requisition" another 55 million shi from the provinces in its controlled areas. At the meeting, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the chairmen of the provinces present to intensify the seizure, claiming that "the only urgent task at present is to have sufficient food and soldiers." At the same time, Tian Yushi, the puppet Deputy Minister of Food, flew to various parts of Central China to press for military grain, and Chiang Kai-shek issued an order announcing the so-called "Regulations on Punishing Crimes Against Grain Management," using fines, confiscation, imprisonment, and the death penalty to coerce the people to hand over grain, showing that the Kuomintang bandit gang's seizure policy has met with strong resistance from the people in its controlled areas.

　　蒋区人民拒绝使用伪金圆券
  　干脆实行以物易物
    蒋匪搜刮粮食遭到有力抵抗
    【新华社陕北十六日电】综合各方消息：蒋区人民已普遍拒绝使用疯狂贬值的伪金圆券作为交换与支付手段。汉口市民早已用银元为通货，湖北各县乡间都有拒用伪金圆券的情形，国民党湖北省政府曾为此慌忙下令查禁。有些地区更干脆实行以物易物。上海四乡农民拒绝接受“信用似在近于乌有的金圆”（美联社），而要求以煤油、洋火、肥皂等换取他们的粮食。甚至浙江奉化日报的广告费也公开索取每英寸谷子三斤的价格。北平、上海的教授和工人，在举行反饥饿罢教罢工时，都要求增发食米，而拒绝接受以金圆券为计算单位的配粮代金、借款和增资。所以“上海公用事业和交通系统的罢工方面至今所达成的一切妥协办法，全不是以金钱而是以大米为基础的”（美联社十日电）。这种情形，使得国民党粮食部次长田雨时也不得不承认：“人民重物轻币，不信任金圆券。”
    【新华社陕北十七日电】综合各方消息：国民党反动政府在其统治区大闹粮荒之时，加紧搜刮民间粮食。除已在加紧勒索中之“惩之”约六千万石外，南京小朝庭于十三日举行“紧急粮食会议”，决定再在其统治区各省“征借”五千五百万石。蒋贼在会上命令其到会各省主席加紧搜刮，声称“当前惟一急务即在足食足兵”。与此同时，伪粮食部次长田雨时并飞往华中各地催逼军粮，蒋贼并以命令公布所谓“违反粮食管理治罪条例”，以罚金、没收、徒刑、死刑等威逼民间缴出粮食，显示国民党匪帮的搜刮政策已遭到其统治区人民强有力强抵抗。
