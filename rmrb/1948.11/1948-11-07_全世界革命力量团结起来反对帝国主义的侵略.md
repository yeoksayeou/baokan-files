Revolutionary Forces of the World Unite Against Imperialist Aggression
(A paper written for the special issue of "Lasting Peace and People's Democracy" magazine commemorating the 31st anniversary of the October Revolution)
Mao Zedong

Now, as the conscious working class and all genuine revolutionaries around the world celebrate the thirty-first anniversary of the great Soviet October Revolution with joy and excitement, I am reminded of the famous essay written by Stalin in 1918, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the October Revolution. In this essay, Stalin said: "The great significance of the October Revolution lies mainly in: first, it broadened the scope of the national question, transforming it from a partial problem of opposing national oppression into a whole problem of liberating all oppressed nations, all colonies, and semi-colonies from imperialism. Second, it opened up vast possibilities and realistic paths for this liberation; thus, it greatly promoted the cause of liberating the oppressed nations of the West and the East, drawing them into the victorious torrent of anti-imperialism. Third, in this way, it built a bridge between the socialist West and the enslaved East, constructing a new revolutionary front against world imperialism, stretching from the Western proletarians through the Russian Revolution to the oppressed nations of the East.”

History has developed in the direction pointed out by Stalin: the October Revolution opened up vast possibilities and realistic paths for the cause of liberation of the people of the world, the October Revolution built a new revolutionary front against world imperialism, stretching from the Western proletarians through the Russian Revolution to the oppressed nations of the East, and this revolutionary front was built and developed under the wise guidance of Lenin and Stalin, and after Lenin's death, under Stalin.

In the world, is there any other revolutionary front besides such a revolutionary front? Has thirty-one years of history not yet proven the utter hypocrisy and complete bankruptcy of the so-called "middle route," the so-called "third way," of all those who are neither satisfied with imperialism nor satisfied with the Soviet Union, of all those who attempt to stand between the counter-revolutionary front of the imperialists and the revolutionary front of the people who oppose imperialism and its running dogs in various countries?

To make a revolution, one must have a revolutionary party in the style of Lenin and Stalin. Without such a revolutionary party, without a revolutionary party built according to the revolutionary theories and revolutionary style of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs. In the more than one hundred years since the emergence of Marxism, it was only when there was the example of the Russian Bolsheviks leading the October Revolution, leading socialist construction, and defeating fascist aggression, that new-style revolutionary parties were established and developed worldwide. Since there have been such revolutionary parties, the face of the world revolution has changed. This change is so great that changes that the older generation could not have imagined have emerged vigorously. The Chinese Communist Party is a party that was established and developed according to the example of the Soviet Communist Party. Since there has been the Chinese Communist Party, the face of the Chinese revolution has been completely renewed. Is not this fact obvious?

The world revolutionary united front, headed by the Soviet Union, defeated the fascist Germany, Italy, and Japan. This is the result of the October Revolution. If it had not been for the October Revolution, if it had not been for the Soviet Communist Party, for the Soviet Union, for the revolutionary united front led by the Soviet Union against imperialism in the West and the East, could one have imagined defeating fascist Germany, Italy, Japan and their running dogs? If the October Revolution opened up vast possibilities and realistic paths for the liberation of the working class and oppressed nations of the world, then the victory of World War II opened up even greater possibilities and more realistic paths for the liberation of the working class and oppressed nations of the world. It would be a great mistake to underestimate the significance of the victory of World War II.

After the victory of World War II, American imperialism and its running dogs in various countries, who replaced the fascist Germany, Italy, and Japan, frantically preparing for a new world war and threatening the world, reflected the extreme corruption of the capitalist world and its terror-stricken mood on the verge of extinction. This enemy is still powerful, therefore, all revolutionary forces within each country must unite with each other, the revolutionary forces of all countries must unite with each other, a united front against imperialism headed by the Soviet Union must be formed, and correct policies must be followed, otherwise victory cannot be achieved. The foundation of this enemy is weak, its internal disintegration, its separation from the people, it has economic crises that cannot be resolved, therefore, it can be defeated. It would be a great mistake to overestimate the enemy's strength and underestimate the revolutionary forces.

The great people's democratic revolution under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, aimed at opposing the crazy aggression of American imperialism against China, opposing the traitorous dictatorship and the Kuomintang reactionary government that massacred the Chinese people with civil war, has now achieved great victories. The People's Liberation Army led by the Chinese Communist Party, in the two years from July 1946 to June 1948, had already repelled the offensive of 4.3 million troops of the Kuomintang reactionary government, and turned itself from defense to offense. In two years of combat (developments after July 1948 are not included in the calculation), the People's Liberation Army captured and eliminated 2.64 million Kuomintang troops. The current area of the Chinese Liberated Areas is 2.35 million square kilometers, accounting for 24.5 percent of the national area of 9.59 million square kilometers. The current population is 168 million, accounting for 35.3 percent of the national population of 475 million. There are currently 586 cities, accounting for 29 percent of the 2,009 cities in the country. Because our Party resolutely led the peasants to realize the reform of the land system, the land problem has now been thoroughly resolved in the area of approximately 100 million people, and the land of the landlord class and the old-style rich peasants has been distributed roughly equally to the rural people, first of all to the poor peasants and farm laborers. The number of members of the Chinese Communist Party has increased from 1.21 million in 1945 to the current 3 million. The task of the Chinese Communist Party is to unite all revolutionary forces throughout the country, drive out the aggressive forces of American imperialism, overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and establish a unified democratic people's republic. We know that we still have many difficulties ahead of us. But we are not afraid of these difficulties. We believe that difficulties must be overcome and can be overcome.

The light of the October Revolution shines on us. The suffering Chinese people must seek liberation, and they firmly believe that they can achieve liberation. The once isolated Chinese revolutionary struggle no longer feels isolated since the victory of the October Revolution, and we have the assistance of the communist parties and the working class of the world. Sun Yat-sen, the pioneer of the Chinese revolution, understood this, and he established the policy of uniting with the Soviet Union against imperialism. On his deathbed, he also wrote a letter to the Soviet Union as part of his will. It is the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang of the Kuomintang who betrayed Sun Yat-sen's policies, stood on the counter-revolutionary front of imperialism, and opposed the people of their own country. But people will not have to wait long to see that the entire reactionary rule of the Kuomintang will be completely shattered by the Chinese people. The Chinese people are brave, and the Chinese Communist Party is also brave, they must liberate all of China.

　　全世界革命力量团结起来反对帝国主义的侵略
    （给“持久和平与人民民主”杂志纪念十月革命三十一周年专号所写的论文）
    毛泽东
    现在，当着全世界觉悟的工人阶级和一切真诚革命的人们对于苏联伟大的十月革命第三十一个周年举行欢欣鼓舞的纪念的时候，使我想起斯大林在一九一八年，在十月革命第一个周年纪念的时候所写的著名的论文。斯大林在这篇论文中说：“十月革命的伟大意义，主要地是：第一，它扩大了民族问题的范围，把它从反对民族压迫的局部问题，变为各被压迫民族、各殖民地及半殖民地从帝国主义下面解放出来的一个整个问题。第二，它给这一解放开辟了广大的可能性和现实的道路；这样，就大大促进了西方和东方的被压迫民族的解放事业，把它们吸收到胜利的反帝国主义的巨流中去。第三，这样，它就在社会主义的西方和被奴役的东方之间架起了一道桥梁，建筑了一条从西方无产者经过俄国革命到东方被压迫民族的新的反对世界帝国主义的革命战线。”
    历史是按照斯大林所指出的方向发展的：十月革命给世界人民解放事业开辟了广大的可能性和现实的道路，十月革命建筑了一条从西方无产者经过俄国革命到东方被压迫民族的新的反对世界帝国主义的革命战线，并且这条革命战线是在列宁和斯大林而在列宁死后是在斯大林的英明的指导之下建筑起来和发展起来的。
    在世界范围内，难道除了这样一条革命战线以外，还有什么别的革命战线吗？三十一年的历史难道还没有证明：一切既不满意帝国主义，又不满意苏联的人们，一切企图站在帝国主义者的反革命战线和反对帝国主义及其在各国的走狗的人们的革命战线之间的所谓“中间路线”，所谓“第三条道路”的彻底虚伪和彻底破产吗？
    既要革命，就要有一个列宁、斯大林式的革命党。没有这样一个革命党，没有一个按照马、恩、列、斯的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级及广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。自从马克思主义产生以来的一百多年的时间内，只是在有了俄国布尔什维克领导十月革命、领导社会主义建设和战胜法西斯侵略的榜样的时候，才在世界范围内建立了和发展了新式的革命党。自从有了这样的革命党，世界革命的面目就起了变化了。这个变化是如此巨大，以致使老一辈的人们完全不能设想的变革，都轰轰烈烈地出现了。中国共产党就是依照苏联共产党的榜样建立起来和发展起来的一个党。自从有了中国共产党，中国革命的面目就焕然一新了。这个事实难道还不明显吗？
    以苏联为首的世界革命统一战线，战胜了法西斯主义的德意日。这是十月革命的结果。假如没有十月革命，假如没有苏联共产党，没有苏联，没有苏联领导的西方与东方的反对帝国主义的革命统一战线，还能设想战胜法西斯德意日及其走狗们吗？如果说，十月革命给全世界工人阶级和被压迫民族的解放事业开辟了广大的可能性和现实的道路，那么，第二次世界大战的胜利就是给全世界工人阶级和被压迫民族的解放事业开辟了更加广大的可能性和更加现实的道路。对于第二次世界大战的胜利的意义估计不足，将是一个极大的错误。
    第二次世界大战胜利以后，代替法西斯德意日的地位而疯狂地准备新的世界战争、威胁全世界的美国帝国主义及其在各国的走狗们，反映了资本主义世界的极端腐败及其濒于灭亡的恐怖情绪。这个敌人还是有力量的，因此，每一个国家内部的一切革命力量必须互相团结起来，一切国家的革命力量必须互相团结起来，必须组成以苏联为首的反对帝国主义的统一战线，并遵循正确的政策，否则就不能胜利。这个敌人的基础是虚弱的，它的内部分崩离析，它脱离人民，它有无法解脱的经济危机，因此，它是能够被战胜的。对于敌人力量的过高估计和对于革命力量的估计不足，将是一个极大的错误。
    在中国共产党领导之下的以反对美国帝国主义对于中国的疯狂侵略、反对卖国独裁和以内战屠杀中国人民的国民党反动政府为目标的伟大的人民民主革命，现在已经取得了巨大的胜利。中国共产党领导的人民解放军，在一九四六年七月至一九四八年六月的两年时间内，已经打退了国民党反动政府的四百三十万军队的进攻，并使自己由防御转到了进攻。在两年作战中（一九四八年七月以后的发展，尚未计算在内），人民解放军俘虏及消灭了国民党军队二百六十四万人。中国解放区现有面积二百三十五万平方公里，占全国面积九百五十九万平方公里的百分之二十四点五。现有人口一万万六千八百万，占全国人口四万万七千五百万的百分之三十五点三。现有城市五百八十六座，占全国城市二千零九座的百分之二十九。由于我党坚决地领导农民实现了土地制度的改革，现已在大约一万万人口的区域彻底地解决了土地问题，地主阶级及旧式富农的土地大致平均地分配给了农村人民，首先是贫农和雇农。中国共产党的党员，由一九四五年的一百二十一万人，增加到了现在的三百万人。中国共产党的任务，是在全国范围内团结一切革命力量，驱逐美国帝国主义的侵略势力，打倒国民党的反动统治，建立统一的民主的人民共和国。我们知道，我们面前还有许多困难。但是，我们不怕这些困难。我们认为困难是必须克服，并且能够克服的。
    十月革命的光芒照耀着我们。苦难的中国人民必须求得解放，并且他们坚信是能够求得解放的。一向孤立的中国革命斗争，自从十月革命胜利以后，就不再感觉孤立了，我们有全世界的共产党和工人阶级的援助。这一点，中国革命的先行者孙中山先生是理解的，他确定了联合苏联反对帝国主义的政策。他在临终的时候，还写了一封给苏联的信，当作他的一份遗嘱。背叛孙中山的政策，站在帝国主义反革命战线方面、反对自己国家的人民的，是国民党的蒋介石匪帮们。但是人们不要很久就可以看到，国民党的全部反动统治将被中国人民所彻底打碎。中国人民是勇敢的，中国共产党也是勇敢的，他们一定要解放全中国。
