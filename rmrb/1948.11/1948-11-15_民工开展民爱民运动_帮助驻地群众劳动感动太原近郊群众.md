[Jinzhong News] The support-the-frontline laborers, utilizing breaks from their heavy work, have been promoting our Party's various policies and the PLA's victorious news to the masses near Taiyuan. They strictly abide by mass discipline and help the masses with the autumn harvest, earning assistance and praise from the local people in various ways through their practical actions. The masses near Taiyuan, long ruled under Yan Xishan's tyrannical government, had some doubts in their minds due to Yan's harassment, looting, and slanderous propaganda against our army, lacking understanding of our Party's policies. In response to this situation, our support-the-front laborers launched a "Love-the-People" campaign, calling for even stricter discipline to win the masses' understanding and assistance through verbal promotion and, especially, practical actions. They helped the masses with their labor as much as possible during their spare time. When laborers from Qi County were stationed in Xirong and Tianzhuang, the masses initially thought they were the same as Yan Xishan's troops and hid their mats and furniture. The laborers then stayed in empty rooms. The next morning, they swept the courtyards, carried water, cut grain, and threshed for the masses. They politely declined anything the masses offered, moving them to immediately bring out their mats and furniture again. When the Second Company of Pingding first arrived at their lodging, they couldn't borrow anything. They patiently explained our Party's policies, the Three Main Rules of Discipline, and the Eight Points for Attention to the masses. At the same time, they organized ten people to help with the autumn harvest, carrying back eight mu of corn and black beans, threshing and cutting grain. The masses not only lent them things but also sent dates and vegetables, which they refused to accept, but the masses insisted that they keep them. When the Jizhong laborers encountered the same situation, they couldn't borrow pots, so everyone pooled their money to buy them; they couldn't find houses, so they camped in the open. Afterwards, they actively promoted the policies to the masses and helped with the autumn harvest, and the masses immediately gave up their houses. The result of this practical action greatly expanded political influence. As an old man in a newly liberated area said, "Not to mention the People's Liberation Army, even the laborers sent by the liberated areas are so good. I have never seen anything like this in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms or the history of other countries." According to statistics from the Zanhuang Brigade and the First Battalion of the Taiyuan Brigade, in addition to carrying water and manure and other odd jobs, they cut more than 600 bundles of grain, threshed 550 dan of grain, and harvested more than 100 mu of crops. The laborers from the first, third, and fourth districts of Xiaoyi County alone helped harvest more than 800 mu, with the entire county's laborers estimated to have helped with more than 2,000 mu.

　　民工开展民爱民运动
  　帮助驻地群众劳动感动太原近郊群众
    【晋中讯】支前各部民工利用繁重的工作空隙，向太原近郊群众宣传我党各项政策和解放军胜利消息，并严守群众纪律，帮助群众秋收，以实际行动获得当地群众各方面的帮助与称赞。长期被统治于阎匪暴政下的太原近郊群众，由于阎匪之骚扰抢劫及其对我军的诬蔑宣传，因之不了解我党政策，思想上存在某些疑虑。针对这种情况，我支前民工各部开展“民爱民”运动，号召在此情况下更应严守纪律，以口头宣传，特别是实际行动争取群众了解和帮助。在利用工作闲暇帮助群众劳动中，有多少时间便作多少。祁县民工驻西荣、田庄时，群众初以为和阎匪一样，就把席子家具都藏起。民工便在空房住下，第二天早晨便给群众扫院、担水、割谷、打场，连群众过意不去而送的东西也婉言谢绝，感动的群众立刻又拿出席子、家具。平定二连初驻下宿营时，借不出东西；他们一面耐心的向群众讲解我党政策，三大纪律，八项注意；一面组织十个人帮助收秋，担回八亩玉茭子、黑豆，又打场又切谷，群众不但借给他们东西，而且又送枣、送菜，他们拒绝收纳，群众强着要他们留下。冀中民工碰见同样情况时，借不下锅，大家集钱去买；找不下房子，在野外露营。随后即积极向群众宣传，帮助收秋，群众即让出房子。这种实际行动的结果，大大扩大了政治影响，正如一新区老汉所讲：“不用说解放军，连解放区应差的老百姓也这么好，我看了三国列国也没见过。”据赞皇大队及太谷大队一营统计，除担水担粪等零星劳动外，共切谷六百余捆，打场五五零石，割庄稼百余亩，担庄稼百余捆。而孝义一、三、四三个区参战民工，即帮助收秋八百余亩，全县民工估计在二千亩以上。（后勤记者小组）
