Xinhua News Agency, North China, 19th: Newspapers in Peiping and Tianjin disclosed that the struggle of employees in the transportation sector in Peiping and Tianjin against hunger and persecution continued to expand at the beginning of this month. Following the strikes by tram and bus workers in Tianjin and the work slowdown by telecommunications workers in Peiping and Tianjin in late October, a petition of "starving workers" erupted on the 5th when over 2,000 employees of the Peiping-Hankou Railway Bureau demanded a living wage. Since the Kuomintang government's "currency reform," workers at the Peiping-Hankou Railway Bureau have only received monthly salaries of 20 to 30 yuan (enough to buy only a dozen kilograms of rice at the beginning of the month in Peiping and Tianjin). The monthly income of ordinary staff members is no more than 70 to 80 yuan, and many employees have been plunged into dire straits. The bureau's employees made three demands on the 1st of this month: the issuance of 200 yuan in relief funds, two bags of flour, and two tons of coal. As there was no result by the 4th, more than 2,000 people gathered at the West Station Square at 2:00 p.m. that day to demand a response from the bureau. With no response by 4:00 p.m., the crowd became indignant and marched to the bureau in West Jiaomin Lane to petition, shouting slogans against hunger and sending out pickets to guard the bureau's gates and prevent the bureau chief from escaping. The petitioning employees stayed overnight in the bureau, holding an "hunger strike." At 6:20 a.m. on the 5th, they forcibly took the bureau chief to the East Station to stage a sit-in on the tracks, preventing the departure of train No. 21, and only left after the bureau chief agreed to respond within a week.

The "hunger strike" of Tianjin Telecommunications Bureau employees against hunger continued until October 30th. On that day, more than 1,000 employees of the bureau went to the Kuomintang headquarters to petition, demanding the release of the 32 arrested employees. After the petition, they surrounded the bureau on Chifeng Road, demanding that the bureau chief be responsible for bailing them out, while also cutting off traffic in and out of the bureau, only leaving at 11:40 p.m. that night. On the same day, more than 200 employees of the Tanggu Station of the Beining Railway petitioned, putting forward four demands for improved living conditions.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: A wave of protests against the Kuomintang government's deliberate suppression of workers' "cost of living index" has been sweeping through Shanghai. A Reuters dispatch from Shanghai on the 18th stated: "Shanghai is in danger of strikes breaking out everywhere today. The resentment of Shanghai's million workers towards the unrealistic cost of living index set by the municipal government three days ago is growing daily. Labor generally condemns the index for failing to reflect the true rise in prices." Reuters reported that the protest against the cost of living index had paralyzed one of Shanghai's largest employers of labor, the silk reeling industry, and threatened to spread to the textile and maritime industries. Under the pressure of large-scale anti-hunger strikes by workers in Shanghai, the Shanghai Kuomintang municipal authorities were recently forced to re-adopt the method of stipulating the cost of living index, stipulating that workers' wages should be 8.1 times the price level of August 19th. However, this index far lagged behind the multiple by which prices had risen in Shanghai. On the 13th, "the prices of various goods in Shanghai were still 20 to 30 times the price limits of August 19th" (Reuters), while the price of rice in Shanghai had risen to 85 times the price limits of August 19th on the 10th. Therefore, an Agence France-Presse dispatch also said: this index "still cannot enable workers to maintain the already very low standard of living of August 19th."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Strikes in Shanghai continue to expand. According to an Associated Press report, a major strike by customs officers broke out again on the 20th. The Associated Press stated: this strike is actually "a continuation of their sit-down strike over the past two weeks." The strike by cinema mechanics continues, and cinema ushers have also been drawn into the struggle, demanding that the excessively low "cost of living index" stipulated by the Kuomintang government be doubled. This strike has caused all cinemas in Shanghai to stop showing films. The Associated Press reported that the number of workers on strike in various industries in Shanghai "has reached six figures or more" (i.e., more than 100,000).

　　北平天津上海工人罢工反饥饿反迫害
    【新华社华北十九日电】平、津报纸披露：平、津交通界职工反饥饿反迫害斗争本月初继续扩大。继十月下旬津市雷车、公共汽车罢工及平、津两地电信工人怠工后，本月五日又爆发平汉路局北平全体员工二千余人的争温饱请愿“饿工”。自国民党政府“币改”后，北平平汉路局工人月薪仅二、三十元（按月初平津米价，只够买十多斤米），普通职员月入亦不过七、八十元，许多职工生活陷入绝境。该局职工于本月一日提出发救济费二百元，面粉两袋及燃煤二吨三项要求，至四日仍未得结果，乃集合二千余人于当日下午二时齐集西站广场要求路局答复，至下午四时仍无反响，群情愤激集队至西交民巷该局请愿，高呼反饥饿口号，并派出纠察队把守局内各门，阻止该局局长走脱。当时请愿员工留宿局内举行“饿工”，至五日晨六时二十分，挟持该局局长至东站举行卧轨，阻止第二十一次火车开出，移经该局局长答应在一周内答复后始离去。
    天津电信局职工反饥饿“饿工”至十月三十日仍坚持中。是日该局职工千余人赴国民党部请愿，要求释放被捕的三十二个职工。请愿后复包围赤峰道该局，要求局长负责出面保释，同时并断绝局内外交通，至当晚十一时四十分始离去。同日，北宁铁路塘沽站二百余职工请愿，提出四项改善生活待遇要求。
    【新华社陕北廿一日电】上海工人掀起对国民党政府故意压低工人“生活指数”的抗议浪潮。路透社上海十八日消息称：“上海今日已有到处发生罢工之虞，上海百万工人对于市政府三日前所规定的完全不合实际的生活指数的愤慨，日有增长。劳工一般都谴责指数未能反映物价上涨的真正情况。路透社称：对这一生活指数的抗议，已使上海雇用劳工最多的行业之一——缫丝厂麻痹，并有扩展到纺织厂和海员之势。按在上海工人大规模反饥饿罢工的压力下，上海国民党市当局最近被迫重新采取规定生活指数的办法，将工人工资规定为八月十九日物价水平的八点一倍。但此指数远远落后于上海物价上涨的倍数，十三日“上海各种物品价格仍为八一九限价的二十倍到三十倍”（路透社），上海米价则已于十日上涨为八一九限价的八十五倍。所以法新社消息亦说：此一指数“仍不能使工人维持八月十九日本已很低的生活水平”。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】上海罢工继续扩大。据美联社消息：二十日又爆发海关职员的大罢工。美联社称：这一罢工实际上是他们“过去两周静坐罢工的延续”。电影院机器工人的罢工仍在坚持，影院招待员亦已卷入这一斗争，他们要求将国民党政府所规定的过低“生活指数”提高一倍。这一罢工已使上海各电影院停演。美联社称：上海各业工人罢工人数“已达到六位数字以上”（即十万人以上）。
