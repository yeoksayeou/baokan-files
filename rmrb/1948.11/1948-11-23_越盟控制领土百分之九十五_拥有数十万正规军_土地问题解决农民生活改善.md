　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Comprehensive report: "The French only occupy the land their soldiers stand on." This comment, made sixty-eight years ago by a French journalist about the initial "conquest" of Vietnam by French colonialists, is entirely applicable today. Regarding the current situation in Vietnam, according to a United Press report of October 24th citing London military observers: "The French control the major cities of Hanoi, Hue, Tourane, and Saigon, but the lines of communication are under Viet Minh fire. Unless heavily guarded, no one dares to go outside the cities. For example, French air passengers traveling seven miles from Hanoi to the jungle airport must be escorted with a forest of guns and bayonets. The Viet Minh forces have self-made explosives and weapons, and their work in disrupting traffic with landmines is so thorough that they have destroyed the railway subgrade in many areas."

　　The French reactionaries' forces used to invade the People's Republic of Vietnam, including a 10,000-strong European legion largely composed of Nazis and 30,000 Vietnamese puppet troops, total 123,000 men. To maintain this invading army, France spent as much as $283 million in military expenses in 1947. Since this year, the French government has supported its colonial war against the People's Republic of Vietnam with $40 million worth of materials from the Marshall Plan. Although the French reactionaries have put in so much effort, they have not gained a single penny from this fertile land of Vietnam. According to U.S. News & World Report magazine: Before the war, Vietnam's total annual exports were nearly four million tons, while in 1947 the total exports were less than 220,000 tons. Rice has always been Vietnam's main product, with annual exports of about 1.5 million tons before the war, but last year's exports plummeted to about 90,000 tons. Corn exports averaged about 500,000 tons per year before the war, but now it is only 25,000 tons.

　　In the three years of war, the French invading army has only occupied a few large cities near the coast, and 95 percent of the territory remains under the control of the Viet Minh. The Viet Minh's heroic resistance has inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. According to the Viet Minh's announcement in September this year regarding their three-year battle achievements, a total of 53,000 enemies were killed and 35,000 were wounded (according to the Viet Minh's announcement in September last year regarding their two-year battle achievements, a total of 58,000 enemies were killed and wounded, based on which the third year killed and wounded 30,000 enemies), 21 enemy lieutenant colonels and colonels were captured or wounded, and 7,200 rifles, 1,639 heavy machine guns, 104 artillery pieces and mortars, and 75 rocket launchers were seized. Last winter, the French army lost more than 9,000 officers and soldiers in the large "sweep" in North Vietnam, while the Viet Minh only sacrificed more than 400 people. In continuous battles, the Viet Minh army has grown from a force of 20,000 men in 1945 to 100,000 men the year before last, and since last year, it has developed into a powerful armed force with hundreds of thousands of regular troops, hundreds of thousands of guerrillas, and millions of militiamen.

　　In the vast territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, because the land problem has been resolved, the lives of farmers have been greatly improved. Of the 11.25 million acres of arable land in Vietnam, three-quarters belong to the French and the Catholic Church. The land occupied by the French has now been unconditionally confiscated by the government, and most of it belongs to the tillers. The rent for the land of local landlords has also been reduced by 50 percent. The heavy poll tax during the French rule has now been abolished. The Vietnamese government is also actively leading the construction of water conservancy projects and land reclamation. The construction of dikes has reached 2,388 kilometers, protecting millions of acres of rice fields, and the reclaimed area has reached 800,000 acres. Cultural undertakings have also developed significantly. There are currently 30 kinds of letterpress newspapers and more than 1,000 kinds of mimeographed newspapers. Six million people in the republic have been freed from illiteracy.

　　Shocked by the powerful military and political strength of the Vietnamese people, the French reactionaries replaced the "High Commissioner" in Vietnam, Bollaert, with Pignon last month, and felt that the current puppet provisional government was not working, so they stepped up negotiations with Vietnamese Emperor Bao Dai in Paris, attempting to deceive and divide the Vietnamese people with this feudal remnant. However, as Vietnamese people's leader Ho Chi Minh pointed out in a broadcast in September: The Vietnamese people "must not give the puppets peace, and must continue the struggle until they achieve independence and true unity."

### 越盟控制领土百分之九十五　拥有数十万正规军  土地问题解决农民生活改善

　　越盟控制领土百分之九十五
  　拥有数十万正规军
    土地问题解决农民生活改善
    【新华社陕北十四日电】综合报导：“法国人只占据了它的士兵脚底下踏着的土地”，六十八年前法国记者对法国殖民者最初“征服”越南时所作的这一评语，完全适用于今天。关于越南目前的形势，据合众社十月廿四日引伦敦军事观察家的评论称：“法国控制着大城市河内、顺化、土伦、西贡，但交通线却处在越盟的火力下。除非在重兵护卫下，没有人敢到城外去。例如法国航空旅客由河内走七哩到丛林的机场去，都要刀枪林立地护送。越盟军有自造的炸药和武器，他们用地雷破坏交通的工作，做得如此彻底，以致在许多地区把铁路路基都毁坏了。”
    法国反动派使用于侵略越南人民共和国的军队，包括大部分由纳粹组成的一万人欧籍军团及三万人越南伪军在内，共有十二万三千人。为了维持这支侵略军，法国于一九四七年度所耗费的军费即达二亿八千三百万美元。今年以来，法政府曾以马歇尔计划中四千万美元的物资支持其反对越南人民共和国的殖民战争。法国反动派虽然出了这么大的力气，但是，它并没有从越南这一块肥沃的土地上取得一点点代价。据美国新闻与世界报导杂志称：战前，越南每年的输出总量几近四百万吨，而一九四七年的输出总量还不到二十二万吨。米一向是越南的主要出产，战前每年的输出一百五十万吨左右，去年的输出额则锐减至九万吨左右。玉蜀黍的输出额，战前平均每年约五十万吨，而现在则只有二万五千吨。
    在三年的战争中，法国侵略军仅占据了靠近海岸的几个大城市，百分之九十五的领土依然在越盟军的控制底下。越盟军的英勇抗战，给敌人以重大的杀伤。据今年九月越盟军所宣布的三年战绩，共毙敌五万三千人，伤敌三万五千人（按去年九月越盟军宣布的两年战绩，共毙伤敌五万八千人，据此第三年共毙伤敌三万人），俘伤敌中上校军官廿一名，缴获步枪七千二百支，重机枪一六三九挺，大炮及迫击炮一零四门，火箭炮七十五门。去年冬天，法军在北圻的大“扫荡”中，损失官兵九千多名，而越军仅牺牲四百余人。越盟军在不断战斗中，已从一九四五年两万人的部队，成长为前年的十万人，去年以来，更发展成为拥有数十万正规军，数十万游击队和数百万民兵的强大武装。
    在广大的越南民主共和国境内，由于解决了土地问题，农民生活大为改善，全越南一一二五万英亩可耕地中，其中四分之三属于法国人及天主教堂所有，现法国人霸占之土地已由政府无条件没收，大部归耕者所有。本地地主的田地亦均减租百分之五十。法国统治时期苛重的人头税，现已取消。越南政府并积极领导兴修水利与垦荒，修堤计达二三八八公里，数百万亩稻田得到保护，垦荒面积已达八十万英亩。文化事业也有显著发展。现有铅印报纸三十种，油印报纸千余种之多。共和国境内有六百万人，已脱离文盲状态。
    被越南人民强大的军事与政治力量所震骇的法国反动派，于上月撤换了驻越南“高级专员”波拉埃，以皮农代替他，并且已感到目前的傀儡临时政府起不了作用，又在巴黎与越南皇保大加紧谈判，企图以这个封建余孽来欺骗与分裂越南人民。然而，正如越南人民领袖胡志明在九月间广播中指出的：越南人民“必须不给傀儡以和平，必须继续斗争直到获得独立与真正的统一”。
