Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Before his death in the Black Sea, Mr. Feng Yuxiang wrote a letter to Mr. Li Jishen in Hong Kong on August 12, when his ship passed through Alexandria, Egypt. The letter recounts his stern refusal of the enticement of American reactionaries, as well as the corruption of American domestic affairs, social unrest, and the suffering of overseas Chinese that he witnessed during his stay in the United States. The letter was reprinted by a newspaper in Peiping, and the original text stated:

　　"Once, it was the son of an old friend of mine, working in their government, called ××××. He made a special phone appointment beforehand, saying that there was something important to discuss. ×××× said: 'Reports from American officials and missionaries returning from China, as well as the American government, say that the majority of the Chinese people are hoping that Mr. Feng Yuxiang will return to China to clean up everything, and so on. Our American government is against the Communist Party and will never cooperate with the Communist Party. Only if you don't want the Communist Party, our American government is willing to help you a lot, with plenty of money and military supplies.' My reply was: 'No matter what you do, you must talk about reason and human feelings. You say you don't want the Communist Party, which has nothing to do with us. The Three People's Principles established by Mr. Sun Yat-sen are our standard, and we cannot change them casually. To change this would be to betray us.'"

　　"×××× said: 'We will give you six months to consider for you democrats. … This is the opinion of us Americans, as long as you don't want the Communist Party, we are willing to help you democrats.' My reply: 'Our China has thousands of years of culture, unlike the United States, which is only a short hundred years. Our philosophy is: Heaven hears as the people hear, Heaven sees as the people see. This explains that the people of the whole country, the workers and peasants, like what we say. But it has never been said that Heaven sees as Americans see, Heaven hears as Americans hear. What Americans like us to say, we say. What Americans like us to do, we do. Do you think I, Feng Yuxiang, am the kind of person who does these things?' In short, we talked for an hour and a half, and the result was an unhappy parting."

　　"For various reasons, I really have to leave the United States. In Xiang's judgment, the United States is taking the first steps towards fascism. Suppressing black people, killing them randomly, and nothing happens after the killings. Suppressing freedom fighters, arresting them and convicting them at will. They treat Jews, Red Indians, and overseas Chinese inhumanely. Capitalist tycoons hold 98% of the newspapers in their hands, and 99% of the magazines and publications are their own tools. You can't see a word of truth, and the whole page is full of rumors and slander against the workers and peasants. Ten provinces in the United States are suffering from major floods, and no one cares. At least 20 million people have no houses to live in. Not to mention anything else, in New York, 25 cents can get you a spot on a board in the basement, and you can sleep for three hours before being kicked out of the hotel. The poor are dying, and the rich almost own half the country. Every time I talk to black people, Jews, Red Indians, and all the oppressed people, they gnash their teeth and hate the American government." "In the American West, 30 universities oppose aid to China, and 440 university professors oppose aid to China. Aid to China is to expand American territory."

　　"Our overseas Chinese, one day in Philadelphia, seventy or eighty people were arrested and imprisoned, saying it was because of gambling. Many overseas Chinese are not allowed to bring their families to the United States. Are they still treating Chinese people as human beings? Near San Francisco, there is a small island where one or two hundred Chinese people are often arrested as soon as they get off the ship, as if they were sitting in prison. They are not questioned for several months or half a year, and they are not allowed to communicate with the outside world. Isn't this an insult to the personality of the Chinese people?"

　　"Every day in the American newspapers, I see sons killing fathers, daughters killing mothers, wives killing husbands, fathers shooting their three children and wives to death with guns, and then killing themselves. There, female students were raped and then shot to death with guns. I carefully counted that, on average, there are no less than two cases of sons killing fathers every day. There are no less than four cases of killing mothers. There are no less than eight cases of wives killing husbands. There is no less than one case of husbands killing wives. At least two people aged seventy to eighty jump from the eighth floor and die. Such a great change in human relations, their congress, government, and society are as if they have not seen it, and they do not care. In America, the dead are like ants to them. Banks are robbed in broad daylight, and people walking on the street are robbed, too many to count. I think the United States is preparing for World War III. It would be better not to fight, but if it really does, I am afraid that those who advocate war will have to suffer the consequences themselves."

　　"It's a coincidence that I'm on a Soviet ship, which is very clean and thoughtful. There are sixty or seventy adults and two hundred young students on the ship. Life on the ship is really orderly, quiet, happy, and harmonious. Everyone is reading there, loving each other, and helping each other. You can't see anyone fighting or scolding. Think about it, two hundred children from eight to eighteen years old, if it weren't for a good education of truth, how could it be like this. The last time I took a ship from Shanghai to San Francisco, there were people fighting, hitting people, and stealing things on the ship. We had three meals a day, standing in line three times, and each time it took more than half an hour. That situation was like getting official porridge in a famine year. That kind of American ship really doesn't treat Chinese people as human beings."

　　冯玉祥致李济琛遗函
    叙述拒绝美反动派引诱经过揭露美国内政腐败华侨痛苦
    【新华社陕北九日电】冯玉祥氏在黑海遇难前，于八月十二日船经埃及亚历山大港时，曾写给香港李济琛氏信一件。信中叙述他严辞拒绝美国反动派引诱的经过，及其留美期间所看到的美国内政的腐败、社会的不安和华侨的痛苦种种情况。该信曾被北平某报转载，原文内称：
    有一次，是我一位老朋友的儿子，在他们政府里作事，叫××××，事前特别用电话约好，说有要紧的事来谈。××××说：“由中国回来的美国官吏和传教士们，及美国政府里的报告说：中国大多数的民众，都是盼望冯玉祥先生回国去收拾一切云云。我们美国政府是反对共产党的，是决不能给共产党合作的。只有你们不要共产党，我们美国政府愿意帮你们的大忙，用钱用军火有的是”。我的回答是：“无论作什么事，天理人情不能不讲。你们说不要共产党，与我们没有关系。孙中山先生手订的三大政策，是我们的标准，那能随便更改，更改了这个，便是叛徒。”
    ××××说：“给你们六个月的时间，请你们民主人士考虑考虑。……我们美国人就是这个意见，只要你们不要共产党，我们就愿意帮助你们民主人士。”我的回答：“我们中国有几千年的文化，不象美国只是短短一百多年。我们的哲学是：天听自我民听，天视自我民视。这是说明全国的人民，工农大众，喜欢什么我们说什么。可是没有说过，天视自美国人视，天听自美国人听。美国人喜欢我们说什么，我们就说什么。美国人喜欢我们作什么，我们就作什么。你看我冯玉祥是作这些事的人吗？”总而言之谈了有一个半钟头的话，结果是不欢而散。
    因为种种原因，实在不能不离开美国，以祥的判断，美国正走法西斯的初步。压制黑人，随便乱杀，杀了无事。压制自由分子，随便抓起来下罪。对犹太人、红人、华侨都是用非人的待遇。资本家的大亨们，把百分之九十八的报纸，全拿在他们手里，百分之九十九的杂志，各项刊物，都是他们自己的工具。一句真话看不见，满篇满幅都是造谣言，毁谤工农大众。美国有十省闹大水灾，无人闻问，至少有二千万人没有房子住。不说别的，纽约有二毛五分钱可以躺在地下一个板上，睡三个钟头就轰出去的旅馆。真是穷的穷的要死，富的差不多半个国家都是他一个人的。每逢同黑人、犹太人、红人，一切被压迫的人谈起来，都是咬牙切齿的痛恨美国的政府。美西（即美国西部）有三十个大学反对援华，有四百几十位大学教授反对援华，援华就是扩充美国的土地。
    我们的华侨，一天在费城抓了七八十个下监，说是因为赌博。许多华侨不准带家眷来美国，这还拿中国人当人吗？三藩市附近，有一个小岛，那里经常有一二百中国人都是一下船就抓起来的，如同坐在监狱一样，几个月半年都不问，并且不许与外界通消息，这不是侮辱中国人的人格是什么？
    每天在美国报纸上看见，就是儿子杀了父亲，女儿杀了母亲，妻子杀了丈夫，作父亲的把他三个孩子和妻子用手枪打死，又打死自己。那里强奸了女学生，然后用手枪打死。我仔细的数了一下，平均起来，每天杀爹的事，少不过二宗。杀母的事，少不过四宗。妻子杀丈夫的事，少不过八宗。丈夫杀妻子的事，少不过一宗。七十岁到八十岁的人，从八层楼跳下来摔死的，至少有两宗。这种人伦的大变，他们的国会、政府、社会就如同没看见一样，满不在意。在美国，死人在他们看来如蚂蚁一样。光天化日之下，银行被抢，走路的人被抢了，太多太多。我看美国正预备第三次世界大战，不战还好，若真打起来，恐怕主张打仗的人们，要自己吃那个苦果。
    这事巧得很，坐的是苏联的船，很洁净周到。这船上有六七十位成年人，有二百多青年学生，船上的生活真是整齐、安静、快乐、和气。没有一个人不是在那里读书，处处相亲相爱，互相帮忙。看不见一个打吵的，骂人的。你想，八岁的孩子到十八岁的孩子，二百岁十个，若不是有一种良好的真理的人的教育，怎样会有这样。我上次坐船，由上海到三藩市，船上的人，有打架的，打人的，偷东西的。吃三顿饭，站三次队，每次都得半点多钟。那种情形，就如同荒年领官粥喝一样。那种美国船，太拿着中国人不当人了。
