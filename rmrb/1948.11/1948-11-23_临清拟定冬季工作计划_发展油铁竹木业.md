  　Municipal Committee Conducts Thorough Persuasion and Mobilization
  　Improving Power to Increase Production
    [Our Newspaper] The Linqing Municipal Committee, based on the Party's policy of developing industry and commerce, and in light of the city's specific conditions, has formulated a winter work plan in early October after multiple discussions, studies, and revisions, clearly stipulating that "restoring and developing industrial production is the central task of winter work." The focus is on supporting and developing the oil pressing, iron, and bamboo and timber industries. Among these three industries, the oil pressing industry has great prospects for development due to the abundant production of cotton, soybeans, peanuts, and rapeseed in nearby counties, ample raw materials, and a wide market. In the three years since liberation, it has recovered to four households before the war with government support. The original Renhe Machine Oil Factory started operation in May this year with a government investment of 50 million. In the recent two and a half months alone, it has pressed 500 shi of rapeseed and 100,000 jin of soybeans. In early November, it added a 30-horsepower large diesel engine to expand its operations. The iron industry has developed to 13 iron factories (four before the war) and more than 50 iron furnace operations (13 before the war). It can now manufacture cotton ginning machines, cotton carding machines, various machine parts, and agricultural implements. In particular, the Yihua Iron Factory, jointly operated by the Workers' Cooperative and Song Haizeng, has manufactured lathes through the diligent research of all factory workers, further increasing its productivity. According to statistics as of November 9, this year the factory has produced 567 cotton ginning machines, 21 cotton carding machines, 7 lithographic printing presses, and 15,030 cast iron pots. The products sell well in western Shandong, northern Henan, and southern Hebei, and are in short supply. The city's iron industry has the technology and relatively complete equipment. Although the local area does not produce raw materials, the shortage is not significant. The bamboo and timber industry was very developed before the war, with a family-based handicraft nature. The products sold well along both sides of the Grand Canal, and the raw materials came from Qinghua and the Northeast. Soon, with smooth transportation, it can be quickly restored. It has now developed to 182 households (76 before the war); however, due to raw material restrictions, output is temporarily less than before the war.

    To further restore and develop industrial production, two working groups have been organized to provide specialized leadership. Municipal Party Secretary Comrade Wu Runting personally leads the private factory group, and the Mayor leads the public factory group. The private factory group first focuses on breaking through the Yihua Iron Factory, jointly operated by the Workers' Cooperative and Song Haizeng. After more than ten days of in-depth understanding and research, it was found that the factory mainly had two problems: First, there was some technical conservatism. For example, although the factory already had more than 100 workers, nine lathes, one lathe, and a large wheel drill, it still used animals (seven large mules) to turn the wheel belt instead of improving the power unit with a diesel engine, saying, "Animals are obedient, they go when you tell them to go, and they stop when you tell them to stop. That thing (referring to the diesel engine) does not listen to orders." Municipal Party Secretary Comrade Wu and others compared the grass consumption and efficiency of the animals with the diesel engine. The value of seven mules would not be completely spent buying a very good diesel engine, and the daily grass and labor consumption of the animals was more than oil, and the efficiency was even less comparable. After such a calculation, the factory shareholders, managers, and others began to understand. The management meeting unanimously decided: immediately go to Jinan to buy a diesel engine. Another problem was that Song Haizeng and the representatives of the Workers' Cooperative disagreed on certain aspects of the factory's operation and management. This was also resolved with the patient and repeated guidance of Comrade Wu and others. After the relationship between the two parties was harmonious, the output immediately increased, and it has now increased from the original three and a half cotton ginning machines per day to four per day. The public factory working group is assisting the factories in studying and improving operation and management based on the spirit of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference. With the joint efforts of the Minister of Propaganda of the Municipal Party Committee and the cadres of the Third District, the bamboo industry households are raising capital to prepare for unified procurement of raw materials. Various public-owned stores are actively helping the factories and handicraftsmen solve raw material difficulties in order to support industrial production. Jianhua Company has transported one million jin of coal to solve the winter fuel for factories and citizens, and is preparing to organize a coal and iron company and a bamboo goods store in order to solve the raw material problems of the iron and bamboo and timber industries in a planned way and support their development.

    The Municipal Party Committee's winter work plan states that "commercial activities that are beneficial to the people's livelihood must also be given attention to lead their development." The focus is on developing the adjustment and transportation industry, especially paying attention to the adjustment and transportation of cotton, grain, and oil. In addition to strengthening the leading role of public-owned stores in the market, supporting the development of cooperatives, fighting against speculators, and ensuring legitimate commercial operations and development, the problem of large cart depots and large cart workers has also been rectified. There are more than 700 large cart transportation workers in the city, who previously had a strong guild mentality. They delineated areas, set their own prices, and forced loading and transportation, which greatly affected commercial transportation. After more than a month of efforts by the Municipal Trade Union and cadres of various districts, in-depth persuasion, mobilization, and education of the workers. It has now been initially resolved, and free transportation and free pricing are beginning to be implemented, and labor mutual assistance is organized on a voluntary basis, gradually developing in the direction of transportation cooperatives.

    Promoting and organizing citizens' production is the third important content of the Municipal Party Committee's work plan. In the past month, all districts have achieved significant results, especially the organization of women's cooperatives to make military uniforms has been the most successful. There are now more than a thousand women in the city, organized into twenty women's cooperatives, and eleven cooperatives have already started working. In the first week of this month, the women's cooperatives received orders from the clothing factory to make more than 4,000 coats.

    In its work, the Municipal Party Committee particularly emphasized that strengthening organization and discipline is the central key to completing the winter work plan, and that the central link in strengthening discipline is to frequently and timely ask for instructions from and report to higher levels. Now the Party, government, labor, and business departments of the city have established a weekly reporting system, a pre-examination system for work plans, and a summary system after the completion of work, and major problems can be reported in a timely manner. The city is now initially able to "understand the major problems that occur in the city on the same day." The cadres of the city are working hard to achieve the production plan. (Tian Liu)

　　临清拟定冬季工作计划
  　发展油铁竹木业
    市委深入说服动员
  　改进动力提高生产
    【本报讯】临清市委根据党发展工商业的方针政策，针对着该市的具体情况，经过多次讨论研究和修正，在十月初拟定了该市冬季工作计划，明确规定：“恢复与发展工业生产，是冬季工作的中心。”并以榨油业、铁业、竹木业为扶助和发展的重点。这三种工业中，榨油业由于附近各县大量出产棉花，大豆、花生、菜籽，原料充足，销路很广，有极大的发展前途。解放三年来，在政府扶助下已恢复到战前的四户。原仁和机器油厂，在今年五月政府投资五千万扶助下开工，仅最近两个半月即榨菜籽五百石，大豆十万斤，十一月初又添装了一部三十马力大柴油机，以便扩大经营。铁业已发展到铁工厂十三家（战前四家）铁炉业五十余家（战前十三家）。现已能制造弹花机、轧花机、及各种机器零件和农具。尤其是工人合作社与宋海增合营的益华铁工厂，在全厂职工苦心钻研下，制造出了旋床，使其生产力更为提高。到十一月九日统计，今年该厂已出弹花机五六七架、轧花机二一架、石印机七架、铸锅一五○三○口。产品畅销鲁西、豫北、冀南各地，供不应求。该市铁工业有技术，已有较完善的设备，原料本地虽不出产，但所缺不多。竹木业在战前很发达，系家庭手工业性质，产品畅销运河两岸，原料来自青化、东北。不久，交通畅通，即能迅速恢复，现已发展到一八二户（战前七十六户）；唯因原料限制，产量暂时还不及战前。
    为进一步恢复和发展工业生产，并组织了两个工作组，专门领导。市委书记吴润亭同志亲自领导私营工厂小组，市长领导公营工厂小组。私营工厂小组首以工人合作社与宋海增合营的益华铁工厂为重点进行突破。经过十多天深入了解与研究，发现该厂主要有两个问题：一、为技术上有些保守，比如该厂已拥有百多工人，九部元车，一部旋床及一个大轮钻，仍用牲口（七头大骡子）转动轮带，不改进动力装置柴油机，说：“牲口听话，叫走就走，叫停就停，那东西（指柴油机）不听指挥。”市委书记吴同志等就给他将牲口的草料消费和效率同柴油机比较，七头骡子的价值买个很好的柴油机还用不完，而牲口每日草料人工消费比油还要多，效率就更不能比了。这么一算帐，该厂股东、经理等开始想通了。经理会议一致决定：立即到济南买柴油机。另一问题是宋海增与工人合作社代表在某些工厂的经营管理上意见不一致，这也在吴同志等耐心反复的开导下解决了。双方关系融洽后，产量立见提高，现已由原来的每日出三部半弹花机提高到每天出四部了。公营工厂工作组，正根据华北工商会议精神，协助各厂研究改进经营管理。在市委宣传部长会同三区干部共同努力下，竹业各户正筹措资本，准备统一去采购原料。各公营商店，为了扶助工业生产，正积极帮助各工厂及手工业者解决原料困难。建华公司已运到煤×百万斤，以解决各工厂及市民冬季燃料，并正筹备组织煤铁公司及竹货店，以便有计划的解决铁业、竹木业原料问题，扶助其发展。
    市委冬季工作计划中关于商业是“对国民生计有利的商业，也必须注意领导其发展”。重点是发展调剂运输事业，尤要注意棉、粮、油的调剂运输。除加强公营商店对市场的领导作用，扶助合作社发展，同投机商作斗争，保证正当商业经营和发展外，并整顿了大车栈及大把车工人问题。该市共有七百多大把车运输工人，过去有浓厚的行帮思想，他们划定地区，自订价格，强装强运，影响商业运输甚巨，经市职工会及各区干部月余努力，深入工人说服动员教育。现已获得初步解决，开始打破地实行自由运输，自由议价，并在自愿的基础上，组织劳力互助，逐渐向运输合作社方向发展。
    推动与组织市民生产，是市委工作计划中第三个重要内容。一月来，各区都已获得显著成绩，特别是组织妇女合作社作军装成绩最大。现全市已有千余妇女，分别组织在二十个妇女合作社中，并已有十一个合作社开始作活。本月第一个星期，各妇女合作社就向被服厂领作大衣四千余件。
    在工作中，市委特别强调加强组织性和纪律性，是完成冬季工作计划的中心关键，加强纪律性的中心环节则是经常及时的向上级请示和报告。现在该市党、政、工、商各部门都已建立每周汇报制度，工作计划的事先审查制度，及工作完成后的总结制度，发生了较大问题已能作到及时请示报告。市季已初步的作到了“了解全市当天发生的重大问题”。现全市干部正紧张的为实现生产计划而努力。（田流）
