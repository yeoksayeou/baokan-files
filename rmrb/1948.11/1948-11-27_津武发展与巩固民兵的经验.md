Jinwu's Experience in Developing and Consolidating the Militia
    Jizhong Branch
    The Jinwu County Party Committee paid special attention to leadership, and as a result, the county's militia has become increasingly consolidated and expanded. The following experiences have been gained:
    (1) In peacetime, constantly educate the masses about defending their homes and defending themselves, and seize favorable opportunities to organize and develop. For example, Gaoqiao, a pseudo-big township, asked a certain village for 8,000 catties of wheat, to be delivered within three days. The masses were anxious and said, "We can't survive like this!" The district cadres seized the opportunity to educate them: "If you want to survive, you can only defend yourself with arms." The village militia organized themselves and repelled the enemy who was looting grain, which had a very good impact on the masses. The district cadres seized the victory to expand education: "Only by fighting can you survive and protect your property." The village militia increased by one-half.
    In the process of development, the masses must be examined to maintain the purity of the militia's composition. After the examination, preliminary tasks are assigned and gradually cultivated, so the militia is very consolidated. Some villages were not cautious in their development and infiltrated by bad elements who attempted to kill our village cadres. These lessons are worth vigilance. At the same time, attention should be paid to overcoming certain employment and deception phenomena. For example, when a village organized a militia, it did not improve class consciousness from the perspective of defending the home and defending themselves, but organized it in the name of changing shifts to watch crops. When a village developed a militia, it said: "Those who have nothing to eat will be given food, those who lack firewood will be given firewood, and those who have no money will be given money to spend." As a result, it collapsed.
    (2) Strengthen the Party's leadership over the militia. In some villages, more than half of the militia are Party members, and the militia cadres are members of the branch committee, which directly controls the armed forces. Some district committees proposed within the Party: "The quality of the militia is the responsibility of the branch, and young and middle-aged Party members should participate in the militia." The district committees personally led the organization of the militia, actively approached the militia after arriving in the village, lived with the militia, and regularly conducted education. They also carried out condolences after the battle, which played a significant role in improving the militia's combat morale.
    (3) Promote the method of cadres leading soldiers and soldiers leading soldiers: cadres should "teach soldiers in peacetime and command in wartime." During the anti-"mopping-up" campaign this spring, county and district cadres went to various villages to personally command. In the continuous village battle in a certain village, nearly a hundred enemies were killed or wounded in one day. New militiamen are gradually improved by older militiamen. For example, Xiao Chang, a new militiaman in a certain village, was initially afraid to take a gun and did not dare to stand guard at night. The old militiamen accompanied him, taught him how to use a gun, and let him deliver letters and bullets during combat, gradually learning. Now he has been trained to be very brave.
    (4) Rectify discipline, strengthen education and training, and prevent the corruption of the militia's life. The combination of production and combat of the militia in a certain village was originally very good, but the county failed to focus on education, and as a result, they ate and drank the grain produced and wasted it, and finally stopped producing, which led to the collapse. The county accepted this lesson, rectified the militia's discipline, and regularly conducted policy education, prohibiting random smuggling, random checkpoints, and random arrests. A certain village also established a criticism system, which changed the bad habits of the past.
    In order to improve combat effectiveness, the county usually pays attention to strengthening military education. Before the wheat harvest this year, a blasting training class was held, and the county's militia conducted a week of large-scale military training, inspected tunnels, fortifications, weapons, and ammunition, and practiced throwing grenades, shooting, and fighting village battles, which improved combat skills. As a result, in the wheat protection battle and the five consecutive village defense battles, 120 enemies were killed or wounded, thwarting the enemy's wheat grabbing plan.
    (5) Closely combine combat and production to strengthen the unity between the militia and their families. The only experience in uniting families is to closely combine combat and production. The militia in a certain village organized production mutual aid, which was supported by the villagers. In addition, county, district, and village cadres should regularly visit the families of militiamen, hold forums for the parents of militiamen, and listen to their feedback in order to rectify them at any time.
    (6) Launch a mass campaign to compete for merit. This spring, the county held a county-wide militia merit evaluation meeting. Militiamen who made meritorious contributions in village battles and tunnel warfare were rewarded, and their combat morale was further improved.

　　津武发展与巩固民兵的经验
    冀中分社
    津武县委特别注意领导，因而该县民兵日益巩固与扩大，并获得以下几点经验：
    （一）平时即不断对群众进行保家自卫的教育，抓住有利时机，进行组织与发展。如高桥伪大乡，向某村要小麦八千斤，限三日送到。群众急了，说：“这样下去活不成了！”区干部即抓紧时机进行教育：“要想活命，只有武装自卫。”该村民兵即组织起来，打退了抢粮的敌人，对群众的影响很好。区干部即乘胜扩大教育：“只有打才能活命，才能保住财产。”该村民兵即增加了二分之一。
    发展中要经群众审查，以保持民兵成份的纯洁。审查后，初步分配一定任务，逐步进行培养，因此民兵很巩固。有的村在发展中不慎重，渗入坏分子，企图将我村干部杀害。这些教训值得警惕。同时，要注意克服某些雇佣欺骗现象。如某村组织民兵时，不从保家自卫去提高阶级觉悟，而以换班看青为名来组织。某村发展民兵时说：“没吃的给吃的，缺烧给烧，没钱给钱花。”结果垮了台。
    （二）加强党对民兵的领导，有的村民兵有一半以上是党员，民兵干部是支委，支部直接掌握了武装。有的区委在党内提出：“民兵的好坏就是支部的责任，青壮年党员应当参加民兵。”区委更亲自带领组织民兵，到村后主动接近民兵，和民兵住在一块，经常进行教育，打仗后并进行慰问，对提高民兵战斗情绪作用很大。
    （三）发扬干部带兵与兵带兵的方法：干部要在“平时教兵，战时指挥。”今春反“扫荡”时，县区干部都分别到各村亲自指挥，某村的连环村落战中一天杀伤敌人近百名。对新民兵是以兵带兵，逐步提高。如某村新民兵小常，起初不敢拿枪，夜间不敢站岗，老民兵就和他作伴，教他使枪，作战时让他送信，送子弹，逐步学习，现在已锻炼得非常勇敢。
    （四）整顿纪律，加强教育训练，防止民兵生活腐化。某村民兵生产战斗原来结合的很好，但县里未抓紧教育，结果他们把生产的粮食吃喝瞎用了，最后就不生产了，以致闹垮了台。该县接受这个教训，整顿了民兵纪律，并经常进行政策教育，不准乱缉私、乱卡、乱抓人。某村并树立了批评制度，转变了过去的坏作风。
    为提高战斗力，该县平时即注意加强军事教育。今年麦收前，召开了爆炸训练班，全县民兵又进行了一周的大练兵，检查了地道工事、武器、弹药，并演习投弹、射击、打村落战等，使战斗技术提高了一步。因之，能在护麦战中，五次连防村落战中，毙伤敌人一百二十名，粉碎了敌人的抢麦计划。
    （五）战斗与生产密切结合，加强民兵与家庭的团结。团结家庭唯一的经验就是战斗生产密切结合，某村民兵组织了生产互助，受到全村群众拥护。此外，县区村干部应经常对民兵家属进行慰问，召开民兵家长座谈会，听取他们的反映，以便随时整顿。
    （六）开展群众性的立功竞赛运动。今春该县召开了全县民兵评功大会，坚持村落战、地道战有功的民兵都受到了奖励，战斗情绪更为提高。
