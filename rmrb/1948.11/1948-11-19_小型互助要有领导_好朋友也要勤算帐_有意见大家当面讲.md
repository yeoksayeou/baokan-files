[Taiyue Telegram] After the Guo Village, First District, Tunliu, reorganized its mutual aid teams and began autumn plowing, the mutual aid teams in the village, which had been organized by administrative order, dissolved in the spring. Afterwards, villagers and neighbors freely formed twelve small work exchange groups of three to five households. However, these groups also dissolved due to a lack of leadership. For example, the Huang An group, which consisted of people from Shandong, believed that it didn't matter if relatives and neighbors did half a day's work more or less, so they didn't pay attention to equivalent exchange. As a result, the differences between those who benefited and those who suffered were too great. Nian Licheng did more than a dozen days of work but received no compensation, not even a kind word, so he felt that he was losing out. The Zhao Fazi and Zhao Guixi group also had similar issues, resulting in a lot of energy when working in their own fields, but a perfunctory attitude when working in others' fields. No one was satisfied, but no one was willing to speak up. Group leader Guo Fazi said, "I'm afraid of this holding back and keeping things to myself; this is really difficult." The Sun Shihai group didn't even have a leader. Everyone spoke their mind, and no one could make a decision. Sun Sizi said, "Even in a lively celebration, you need someone to wave the flag; how can a mutual aid team function without a leader?" In early October, a work team from the First Administrative Office came to the village. After understanding the situation, they began to rectify and transform the small work exchange groups. First, they explained to the village cadres that "leadership by administrative order is wrong, but that doesn't mean there should be no leadership at all." Then, they explained the principle of voluntary equivalence to the masses. Next, they helped each group clear their accounts, elect a leader, and put forward the slogan "Good friends should keep accounts diligently, and express opinions face to face." They mobilized everyone to discuss specific methods for recording work, calculating accounts, equivalent exchange, and diligent accounting, deciding to settle accounts after each task, hold a meeting every five days, evaluate and record work, and determine wages based on mu (area) or shang (area). Originally, the problems with these work exchange groups were not that big. Once resolved, in addition to the original twelve small groups willing to continue exchanging labor, ten new groups were formed. The masses said, "This is true voluntary mutual aid!" On October 12, the entire village began autumn plowing. By October 22, more than 1,400 mu had been plowed. Zhao Shixiang's group had 48 mu of autumn land, originally planned to be plowed by the 24th, but they finished by the 20th and had already started selling excess labor outside the village.

　　小型互助要有领导
  　好朋友也要勤算帐　有意见大家当面讲
    【太岳电】屯留一区郭村整顿互助组，展开秋耕。该村过去以行政命令组织的互助组于今春散伙后，曾由乡亲邻居三家五户自由结合了十二个小型变工组，但因缺乏领导，也告散伙。如黄安组，都是山东人，认为乡亲们多做一半个工没意思，所以不讲究等价交换，结果便宜吃亏相差太大。年立成多做了十几个工，没有得上一点报酬，连个人情也没落下，就感到在一起变工吃亏。赵发子与赵贵喜组，也因同样原因，造成到自己地里很有劲，到别人地里就马马虎虎，心里谁也不满，可是谁也不好意思说。组长郭发子说：“就怕这挽住拳头留心事，这事情真不好办。”孙秀孩组连个组长也没有，你一言，我一语，就没个拿主意的人。孙四子说：“闹红火还得个打旗旗的哩，互助组没个领导人还行”？十月初，一专署工作组到该村工作，了解这些情况后，即着手进行整顿与改造小型变工组。首先对村干部讲清：“行政命令的领导方法是错误的，但不能因此不领导。”又给群众讲清自愿等价的原则。接着帮助各组清算帐目，选组长，提出“好朋友勤算帐，有意见当面讲”的口号，发动大家讨论记工算帐、等价交换与勤算帐的具体办法，决定做完一段活算一次帐，五天开一次会，评分记工，按亩按晌决定工资。原来这些变工组问题也不大，一经解决，除原有的十二个小型组都愿继续变工外，又新结合了十个组。群众说：“这才是真正的自愿互助哩。”十月十二日全村开始秋耕，至二十二日已耕一千四百余亩。赵世祥组四十八亩秋地，原计划二十四日耕完，至二十日就完了。并已开始出村卖晌。
