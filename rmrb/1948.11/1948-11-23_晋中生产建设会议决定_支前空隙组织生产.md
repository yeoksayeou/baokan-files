　　Jinzhong Production and Construction Conference Decides
  　Organize Production During Breaks in Supporting the Front
    [Jinzhong Electric] Amidst the sounds of artillery fire attacking Taiyuan, the Jinzhong Administrative Office convened a production and construction conference with the heads of construction departments from each prefecture. The conference discussed winter production and various issues related to next year's production, and established production guidelines. Jinzhong's production and construction situation: Jinzhong District is half old and half new areas, with some of the new areas being disaster areas. Currently, we are in the war environment where our army is directly seizing Taiyuan, and supporting the front is the top priority. We must strive to organize the labor force and animal power for production during breaks in supporting the front. In terms of agriculture: Preliminary estimates for this year's harvest are just over 65%, with higher yields in the old areas. Due to Yan Xishan's "combined forces" tyrannical rule, over 1.5 million mu of land in the new areas have been left barren, and approximately 470 villages are disaster areas; barren land in disaster areas accounts for 50% to 70% of their total land. Two-thirds of the original livestock has been lost, and half of the farm tools and implements are missing. Due to Yan Xishan's conscription and people fleeing, the labor force is extremely scarce. This year, each person has only an average of four to five large dou of coarse grain; a spring famine is unavoidable next year. Jinzhong's water conservancy can currently irrigate over 1.18 million mu. Jinzhong District has many specialties: there are over 470,000 mu of cotton fields, but only over 200,000 mu are currently planted. The annual production of walnut kernels is over 1.48 million jin. The annual production of grapes is over 3.6 million jin. The annual production of pears, fruits, dates, etc. is over 17 million jin. The current annual production of medicinal materials is over 380,000 jin; in the past, it could produce over 4.6 million jin. There are also Sichuan peppers, etc. In terms of industry and mining: there are coal, iron, saltpeter, sulfur, white powder, etc. In terms of industry, textile, paper, and match factories, oil mills, and salt workshops also have development prospects. Because Jinzhong is a new area, some people do not fully understand our Party's policy of developing agriculture and protecting commerce. In the future, we should widely publicize and correctly implement and carry out our Party's policies. Based on the above situation, the conference determined the future production guidelines and tasks: in the old areas, we should vigorously restore and develop agricultural and industrial production, and strive to improve by one inch on the existing basis. In the new areas, we should restore agricultural production, and then restore industries related to agriculture (coal, iron, textiles). In agricultural production, the main tasks are to build water conservancy projects and eliminate barren land, and increase livestock. Water conservancy leadership should have long-term plans and not deal with it on a year-by-year basis. The Fen River Water Conservancy Committee has been established, temporarily composed of the five counties of Wen, Jiao, Ping, Qing, and Qi, and is directly led by the Administrative Office. Each prefecture and county should personally lead the construction of larger water conservancy projects in their respective regions.
    Regarding winter production, the conference unanimously agreed that the main task is to lay the foundation for large-scale production next year. At present, without affecting the task of supporting the front, we should do our best to organize the remaining labor and animal power in the rear, especially women and children, to engage in production. After the liberation of Taiyuan, all labor and animal power should be organized for production, especially to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer. It is required that the old areas apply at least 30 dan of manure per mu next year, and the new areas at least 20 dan. We must increase livestock in a planned way and encourage joint purchases of livestock. The First Prefecture will mobilize the masses to use cloth to exchange for livestock in Yanbei and Chahar South. Each county should set up mating stations for breeding and reproduction. The government will provide loans to increase the purchase of livestock. Prepare for the spring horse fair as soon as possible. Regarding the addition of farm tools, we must mobilize the masses to manufacture and sell them in a planned way, and organize blacksmiths and carpenters to make them in various villages. Regarding water conservancy, we should try to repair those that need to be repaired in winter; for example, the water conservancy of the Fen River must be completed this winter, otherwise, it will delay irrigation. In winter, we must have a planned preparation of seeds, and prepare charcoal and fodder to facilitate production next spring. In the new areas, especially in the disaster areas, we must earnestly lead production and conservation, and prepare to overcome the spring famine. Organize the masses to carry out transportation, workshops, textiles, weaving, coal mining, and other production activities according to local conditions. When carrying out these production activities, we must closely cooperate with the Trade Bureau to understand market conditions, supply raw materials, and promote finished products. For cooperatives, help the good ones that currently exist in the old areas to develop and improve, rectify those with problems, and appropriately restore those that have collapsed, depending on the circumstances. In the new areas, cooperatives can be temporarily unmentioned. If some people voluntarily organize cooperatives, they should be led to move in the right direction. Old loans and grain loans must be recovered and immediately re-lent to support winter production. Finally, the conference especially emphasized that under the unified leadership of the Party, we must closely organize forces. Work must be planned, focused, and centered, and overcome blindness in leadership.

　　晋中生产建设会议决定
  　支前空隙组织生产
    【晋中电】在进攻太原的炮火声中，晋中行署召集各专署建设科开了生产建设会议。讨论了冬季生产及有关明年生产的各项问题，订出了生产方针。晋中生产建设情况：晋中区新老区各半，新区中一部是灾区。目前是正处在我军直接夺取太原的战争环境，支前为第一中心任务，争取支前空隙中组织人畜力生产。农业方面：今年收成初步估计为六成五强，老区收成较高。由于阎匪“兵合”暴政，造成新区荒地一百五十余万亩，并约有四百七十余村为灾区；灾区的荒地占其土地总数的百分之五十到百分之七十。原有牲口损失三分之二；农具用具缺少二分之一。由于阎匪抓兵及逃亡，劳力极其缺少。今年每人仅平均有粗粮四、五大斗；明年春荒是难免的。晋中水利现能灌溉一百一十八万多亩。晋中区特产很多：有棉地四十七万多亩，现仅种二十余万亩。核桃仁年产一百四十八万多斤。葡萄年产三百六十多万斤。梨，果、枣等年产一千七百多万斤。药材现年产三十八万多斤；过去能产四百六十多万斤。另外还有花椒等。工矿业方面：有煤、铁、硝、硫磺、白粉等。工业上纺织、造纸、火柴厂，油坊盐坊等也有发展前途。晋中因系新区，有些人还未完全了解我党发展农业工保护商业的政策。今后应广泛宣传并正确的执行和贯彻我党政策。根据以上情况，会议确定了今后的生产方针与任务：在老区是大力恢复与发展农工业生产，争取在现有基础上提高一寸。在新区是恢复农业生产，并随之恢复有关农业之工业（煤、铁、纺织）生产。农业生产上，主要是兴修水利及消灭荒地，增加牲畜。对水利领导上要长期打算，勿逐年应付。汾河成立水利委员会，暂由文、交、平、清，祁五县组成，由行署直接领导。各专、县应以本区较大水利，亲自领导建设。
    对今冬的生产，会议一致认为主要是打下明年大生产的基础。目前，在不影响支前任务下，尽力组织后方剩余劳畜力，特别是妇女儿童，进行生产。解放太原后，把所有劳畜力组织到生产上，特别是大量积肥。要求老区明年每亩至少上粪三十担，新区至少二十担。要有计划的增加牲畜，发动合伙买牲口。一专为发动群众用布到雁北、察南去换买牲口。各县设交配站，配种繁殖。政府贷款增买些牲口。及早筹备明春马大会等。对农具的增添上，要有计划的发动群众制造、贩卖，组织铁、木匠到各村打制。关于水利，需要在冬天修的，尽量在冬天修起；如汾河的水利，今冬一定要完工，否则便延误灌溉。在冬季就要有计划的准备籽种，筹炭、草料，以利明春生产。在新区，尤其灾区，切实领导生产节约，准备渡过春荒。按各地情况组织群众，进行运输业、作坊、纺织、编织、挖煤等生产。在进行这些生产时，要和贸易局密切配合，以便适于了解行情，供给原料，推销成品。对合作社，老区现存在的好的，帮助其发展提高，有毛病的，加以整顿，已垮台的，要分别情况，适当恢复。在新区，对合作社可暂不提。如有部分群众自愿组织合作社，要加以领导，使其走向正确方向。旧的贷款贷粮一定要收回，并立即转贷出去，以扶植冬季生产。最后，会议特别强调要在党的统一领导下，密切组织力量。工作要有计划、有重点、有中心，克服领导上的盲目性。
