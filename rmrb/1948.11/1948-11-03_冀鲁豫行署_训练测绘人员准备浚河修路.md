    Training Surveying Personnel to Prepare for Dredging Rivers and Repairing Roads
    [JiluYu Electric Dispatch] The JiluYu Administrative Office began training engineering surveying personnel at the beginning of this month to prepare for dredging rivers and repairing roads next spring. The training content includes general and simple engineering theories and knowledge, such as dredging of rivers and canals, and construction of highway bridges and culverts. The main focus is on engineering surveying. The technical requirement is to learn how to use surveying instruments. After completing the training, it is planned to conduct surveying and design for the rivers and canals north and south of the Yellow River in this area that need to be dredged before the end of the year, and commence construction before the spring plowing next year. The Administrative Office notified the special districts and counties to mobilize young students to enroll. Currently, there are more than thirty students.

    冀鲁豫行署
    训练测绘人员准备浚河修路
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫行署于本月初训练工程测绘人员，准备明春浚河修路。训练内容除河渠之疏浚、公路桥梁涵洞之兴修等，一般浅显的工程理论与常识外，主要是工程测量。要求在技术上学会使用测量仪器。学习期满后，拟于年关前将本区黄河南北需要疏浚的河渠作出测量设计，明年春耕前动工。该班由行署通知各专县动员青年学生入学，现有学员三十余人。
