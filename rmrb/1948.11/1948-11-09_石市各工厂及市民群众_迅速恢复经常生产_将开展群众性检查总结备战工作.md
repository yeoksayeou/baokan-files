Shijiazhuang Factories and Citizens
  Rapidly Restore Regular Production
    Mass Inspection, Summation, and War Preparations to be Carried Out

[Report from our Shijiazhuang Office] The people of Shijiazhuang, all 200,000 of them, are extremely excited after the plot by the Chiang Kai-shek/Fu Zuoyi bandit troops to launch a sneak attack on Shijiazhuang was smashed by our People's Liberation Army. A comfort delegation has been organized and dispatched to the northern front to comfort the troops, militia, and civilian laborers who have contributed to the defense of Shijiazhuang. Factories, government offices, shops, and schools have immediately returned to normal operations. The Municipal Government and the Garrison Command have jointly issued a proclamation lifting martial law. The Shijiazhuang Daily published an editorial on the 4th entitled "Rapidly Restore Demobilization and Resume Production," calling for a mass inspection and summation campaign, stating: "This week of war preparation has been a test for us: the bad people have been exposed, the active elements have emerged, and it is crystal clear which cadres are firm and which cadres can represent the interests of the masses. We demand that all citizens come forward to speak, commend the good, criticize the bad, and mete out rewards and punishments fairly, so that the bad people cannot escape our eyes and our cadres' work style can be transformed to be more closely linked to the masses. In this way, the work of our Shijiazhuang will take a step forward." The editorial briefly reviewed the wartime measures taken by the People's Government, such as reporting the enemy situation to the citizens in a timely manner, carrying out necessary resettlement and evacuation, and adhering to price controls, as well as distributing relief grain to some poor citizens, so that the people of the city did not suffer any hardship in their lives due to the Chiang Kai-shek/Fu Zuoyi bandit's sneak attack plot, and other timely measures. It then pointed out: "This week of vivid facts has made us more deeply aware that by closely uniting around the Communist Party and the People's Government, we can create a better and happier life, and we will surely be victorious." In addition to demanding that state-owned factories and shops take the lead in rapidly restoring regular production work, the editorial repeatedly emphasized the need to tell all citizens: "Unless the Chiang Kai-shek/Fu Zuoyi bandit gang is completely eliminated, their plots will not stop. If they cannot come by land, they will send planes to wreak havoc, and if they cannot come openly, they will send special agents to spread rumors and sabotage." Therefore, not only can we not weaken, but we must greatly strengthen the mass defense organization, and strengthen anti-espionage and air defense work. On the evening of the 4th, at 6 p.m., all the districts of Shijiazhuang, one, two, three, and four, held mass rallies separately to celebrate the victory, and specifically study how to strengthen mass defense work and restore and increase production.

　　石市各工厂及市民群众
  　迅速恢复经常生产
    将开展群众性检查总结备战工作
    【本报石家庄讯】蒋傅匪军偷袭石家庄的阴谋遭我人民解放军粉碎后，石家庄廿万人民无不兴奋异常，现已组织慰劳团，前赴北线慰劳这次保石前线作战有功部队、民兵、民工，各工厂、机关、商店、学校立即恢复平时状态，市政府与警备司令部，迅即联合布告解严。石家庄日报四日并以“迅速复员、恢复生产”为题发表社论，号召开展一个群众性的检查总结工作称：“一周的备战，对我们是一个考验：坏人暴露了，积极分子涌现了，那个干部坚定，那个干部能够代表群众利益，都看得清清楚楚。我们要求全体市民起来讲话，表扬好的，批评坏的，赏罚严明，使坏人逃不过我们的眼睛，使我们干部作风改造得更能密切联系群众。这样，我们石家庄的工作就要前进一步。”该社论在简单回顾了这次人民政府各种战时措施，如及时向市民报告敌情，进行必要的安置疏散及坚持平抑物价，并对部分贫苦市民发了救济粮，使全市人民没有因为蒋傅匪的偷袭阴谋而遭受生活上的痛苦等适合时宜的措施之后，指出：“这一周的生动事实，使我们更深刻地认识了：紧密地团结在共产党和人民政府的周围，我们就能创造出更好的幸福生活，我们就一定能胜利。”该社论除要求公营工厂商店积极带头，迅速恢复经常生产工作外，并一再强调要告诉全体市民：“不最后完全消灭蒋傅匪帮，他们的阴谋不会停止。地面来不成，他们还会派飞机来肆扰，公开的来不了，还会派特务来造谣破坏”。因此不仅不能减弱，而且还得大大加强这次群众的防护组织，加强防特、防空工作。四日晚六时，全石家庄一、二、三、四区均分头召开群众大会，庆祝胜利，并具体研究如何加强群众防卫工作及恢复生产提高生产等问题。（展潮）
