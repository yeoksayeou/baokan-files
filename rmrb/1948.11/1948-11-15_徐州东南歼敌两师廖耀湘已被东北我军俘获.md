Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Huaihai, Urgent Telegram, 18:00 on the 12th: The Kuomintang army's 63rd Corps was completely annihilated by the People's Liberation Army at 2:30 AM on the 12th at Yaowan, east of the Grand Canal, 180 li southeast of Xuzhou. The corps consisted of the 352nd Division and the 186th Division, totaling five full regiments, excluding the corps headquarters. This enemy unit fled southwest from the Xin'anzhen area on the Longhai Railway on the 7th. On the evening of the 9th, one regiment was annihilated by the People's Liberation Army near Yantou, 30 li northeast of Yaowan. The remaining troops fled to Yaowan and were heavily surrounded. The People's Liberation Army launched a general offensive against the enemy at 4:00 PM on the 11th and completely annihilated them by 2:30 AM on the 12th.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 13th: Liao Yaoxiang, the highest commander of the Kuomintang army in the Liaoxi Campaign, has been captured. After the complete annihilation of his army east of Heishan at the end of last month, Liao disguised himself and attempted to escape. He was discovered by our army in Zhong'anbu, more than 30 li southwest of Dahushan. Liao Yaoxiang, a native of Qiyang, Hunan, graduated from the third class of Whampoa Military Academy and was sent by Chiang Kai-shek to study military affairs in fascist Italy. He served successively as the commander of the New 21st Division, the commander of the New 6th Army, and the commander of the 9th Corps. The capture of Liao Yaoxiang alive is a serious blow to the Kuomintang's deceptive propaganda. Nanjing’s Kuomintang Central News Agency, on the 4th and 5th of this month, described the annihilation of Liao Yaoxiang's corps in western Liaoning as a "safe transfer," a "spectacular feat." However, the Central News Agency's fabrication was not coordinated with Chiang Kai-shek. Three days later, Chiang Kai-shek slapped the Central News Agency in the face, announcing that "Commander Liao and the entire army in western Liaoning died in their posts, achieving a heroic end." Chiang Kai-shek, at the memorial week held by the Nanjing Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters on the 8th of this month, described Liao Yaoxiang as a sacred figure who "fully demonstrated the spirit of our revolutionary soldiers," attempting to use this imaginary drama to stimulate his military's morale, just as he had done with Zheng Dongguo not long ago. However, the ruthless facts have continuously shattered the dictator Chiang Kai-shek's illusions. After Kang Ze, Wang Yaowu, Fan Hanjie, Zheng Dongguo, and other trusted direct-line generals were either captured or surrendered one after another, Liao Yaoxiang did not lag behind for long. Chiang Kai-shek, who has reached the end of his rope, will no longer be able to find someone to die for him.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th: The enemy generals and officers above the division level captured by our army in the battle in which we completely annihilated the enemy's Liao Yaoxiang Corps of twelve American-equipped divisions in western Liaoning on the 28th of last month have now been identified as a total of twenty-three, with one surrendering. Among them: (1) Three corps commanders and deputy corps commanders: Bai Fengwu, commander of the 71st Corps; Zheng Tingji, commander of the 49th Corps; Wen Xiaoshan, deputy commander of the New 1st Army and commander of the New 30th Division. (2) One corps chief of staff: Yang Kun, Major General Chief of Staff of the Liao Yaoxiang Corps. (3) Eleven divisional commanders and deputy divisional commanders: Luo Ying, commander of the New 22nd Division of the New 6th Army; Yang Yuxian, commander of the 169th Division of the same army; Tan Daoshan, deputy commander of the New 30th Division of the New 1st Army; Chen Jian, deputy commander of the 50th Division of the same army; Xu Ying, commander of the 14th Division of the New 3rd Army; Dong Juemin, deputy commander; Song Bangwei, commander of the 54th Division of the same army; Zou Yuzhen, commander of the 105th Division of the 49th Corps; Luo Xinqiu, commander of the 195th Division of the 6th Corps; Huang Yan, commander of the 87th Division of the 71st Corps; Wang Zhuoqi, deputy commander. (4) Eight officers at the corps and division levels: Li Dinglu, Chief of Staff of the New 3rd Army; Zhang Zhexian, artillery commander of the New 1st Army headquarters; Tang Daofu, director of the political work department; Lu Cixin, chief of staff of the 50th Division; Huang Youxu, deputy chief of staff of the New 6th Army; Shang Qiyue, Major General cavalry regiment commander of the army headquarters; Xu Tieman, chief of staff of the 169th Division; Huang Zui, chief of staff of the 105th Division of the 49th Corps.

　　徐州东南歼敌两师廖耀湘已被东北我军俘获
    【新华社淮海前线十二日十八时急电】国民党军六十三军已于十二日晨二时三十分被解放军歼灭于徐州东南一百八十里运河东岸之窑湾。该军除军部外共辖三五二师及一八六师两个师共五个整团。该敌于七日由陇海路上新安镇地区向西南逃命，九日晚在窑湾东北三十里之堰头附近被解放军歼灭一个团，其余逃至窑湾后即陷重围。解放军于十一日下午四时向该敌发起总攻，至十二日二时三十分即将其全部歼灭。
    【新华社东北前线十三日电】辽西战役中国民党军最高指挥官廖耀湘已被俘获。廖于上月底在黑山以东地区全军覆没后，化装潜逃，在打虎山西南三十余里之中安堡为我军查获。廖耀湘湖南祁阳人，黄埔三期毕业，曾被蒋介石派赴法西斯的意大利学习军事。历任新二十一师师长，新六军军长，第九兵团司令官等职。廖耀湘的生俘给国民党的欺骗宣传一个严重打击。南京国民党中央社在本月四、五两日曾将廖耀湘兵团在辽西的全军覆没，描写为“安全移转”的“壮观伟绩”。但是中央社的造谣没有和蒋介石商量好，三天以后，蒋介石就狠狠地打了中央社的耳光，宣布辽西“廖司令官等全军殉职，壮烈成仁”。蒋介石在本月八日南京国民党中央党部纪念周上，把廖耀湘描写为“充分表现了我们革命军人精神”的神圣，企图用这个幻想的戏剧来刺激他的军心，如同不久以前对于郑洞国所做的那样。但是无情的事实接连地粉碎了独夫蒋介石的幻想。在康泽、王耀武、范汉杰、郑洞国等嫡系心腹大将一个一个就俘与投诚之后，廖耀湘也没有落后得很久。已经山穷水尽的蒋介石，将再也找不到一个替他殉职的人。
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】上月二十八日我军于辽西全歼敌廖耀湘兵团十二个美械师之战役中所俘敌将级及师级以上军官现已查明者共二十三名，另有投诚者一名。其中：（一）正副军长三名：七十一军军长白凤武，四十九军军长郑庭笈，新一军副军长兼新三十师师长文小山。（二）兵团参谋长一名：廖耀湘兵团少将参谋长杨昆。（三）正副师长十一名：新六军新二十二师师长罗英，该军一六九师师长杨羽仙，新一军新三十师副师长谭道善，该军五十师副师长陈坚，新三军十四师师长许颖，副师长董觉民，该军五十四师师长宋邦伟，四十九军一零五师师长邹玉桢，第六军一九五师师长罗莘求，七十一军八十七师师长黄炎，副师长王卓起。（四）军师级官佐八名：新三军参谋长李定陆，新一军军部炮兵指挥官张哲先，政工处长汤道福，五十师参谋长鲁次莘，新六军副参谋长黄友旭，军部少将骑兵团长尚其悦，一六九师参谋长徐铁男，四十九军一零五师参谋长黄最。（五）投诚者为四十九军军部少将医务处长沈百昌。
