　　How is the Autumn Cultivation Progressing?
　　Winter has already begun a few days ago, and it's almost time for the ground to freeze. How is the autumn cultivation progressing?
　　According to reports from correspondents in Shahe County, village cadres in the nine villages of the Baicuo and Xincheng base areas in the Fourth District reported to higher authorities that all the autumn land had been cultivated. However, some land near the county government's location had not been cultivated. Therefore, an inspection team was immediately organized to inspect various villages and found that there were still 1,153 mu of uncultivated stubble land and 1,359 mu of new and old abandoned land. The reason for this, it is said, is mainly because earning money in coal mines is more profitable (7 to 14 jin of millet per person per day). In addition, this year's harvest was poor, and the masses wanted to go to the coal mines to earn some money to supplement their livelihood. Almost all the labor force in Sanwang Village was working in the village's own coal mine. Second, some military dependents, families of revolutionary martyrs, and orphans lacked labor and livestock, could not cultivate the land themselves, and could not find anyone else to do it (because everyone went to the coal mines). Third, some people were waiting for land redistribution.
　　In addition, according to reports from Taiyue, Beiyue, and Jinzhong, the phenomenon of emphasizing sideline occupations and neglecting agriculture, neglecting autumn cultivation, is not uncommon. For example, an inspection in the First District of Tunliu found that out of 56 livestock in Songzhuang, only one pair was at home cultivating the land; out of 37 livestock in Nansong Village, only two pairs were at home cultivating the land, cultivating only 10 mu. The vast majority of the rest were engaged in transportation and sideline occupations.
　　Last year, many places did not carry out autumn cultivation, allowing insect eggs to hide and contributing to this year's insect pests. If we only care about the immediate future this year and relax autumn cultivation, preserving insect eggs and causing harm next year, it will inevitably lead to "chasing every year, but never catching up." Shahe County discovered the problem and immediately conducted in-depth inspections in various villages to promote autumn cultivation, which is worth learning from in various places. In response to the situation in the Baicuo and Xincheng base areas, they proposed combining autumn cultivation with working in coal mines. In Sanwang Village, the people working in the coal mine were divided into three groups, with two groups working in shifts (day shift and night shift) in the coal mine, and one group specializing in cultivating the land, and stipulated that cultivating the land and working in the coal mine would earn the same wages. This method can be used as a reference for various places. However, this requires meticulous organizational work. Especially in places where there are many types of sideline occupations and the profits vary, it is even more necessary to take care of all aspects. If it is not possible to achieve equal value between agriculture and sideline occupations immediately, the masses should be persuaded to seize the season and cultivate the land first, and then fully organize to engage in sideline occupations.
　　In addition, it is very important to repeatedly and continuously carry out propaganda to the masses waiting for land redistribution, especially using examples from villages that have done a good job in ending land reform before autumn, to enlighten the masses to understand the spirit of our Party's policies.

### 秋耕究竟作得怎样？

　　秋耕究竟作得怎样？
    前几天就立了冬，眼看就要上冻了，秋耕究竟做得怎样呢？
    据沙河县通讯员报导，该县四区白错与新城两基点九个村，村干部向上级报告，说是秋地全部耕完了；但在县府驻地附近就有一些地没耕，于是马上组织检查组到各村检查，发现仍有未耕茬地一一五三亩，新旧熟荒一三五九亩。其原因，据说主要是下煤窑赚钱多（每天每人七斤到十四斤小米），又加今年收成不好，群众都想下煤窑去赚点钱来补助生活，三王村几乎全部劳力都在本村窑上。第二、有一部分军干烈属与孤寡户无劳畜力，自己不能耕，找别人也找不到（都下窑去了）。第三、还有些人在等待平分。
    此外据太岳、北岳、晋中各地报导，重副轻农忽视秋耕的现象并不少。如屯留一区检查，宋庄五十六头牲口，只有一犋在家耕地；南宋村三十七头牲口，只两犋在家耕地，耕了十亩。其余绝大部分都在外运输，搞副业。
    去年不少地方因没有实行秋耕，使虫卵得以隐藏，助长了今年虫害。今年如果仍光顾眼前，放松秋耕，保存虫卵遗害明年，势必造成“年年赶，赶不上”。沙河县发现问题，立即深入各村检查，推动秋耕，值得各地学习。他们针对白错与新城两基点的情况，提出秋耕与下窑结合进行，在三王村将下窑的人分做三，两伙分班（日班与夜班）下窑，一伙专门耕地，并规定耕地与下窑赚同样工资，这办法可供各地参考。但这就需要进行细密的组织工作。特别在副业种类较多、利润各不一致的地方，更需要各方面照顾到。如果一下做不到农副等价，即应说服群众，抓紧季节将地耕了，然后全力组织搞副业。
    另外，对部分等待平分的群众，仍应反复不断的进行宣传，特别是以秋前结束土改做得较好的村庄的实例，启发群众了解我党政策的精神，是十分重要的。
