　　[Taihang Telegram] More than 200,000 people in Jiaozuo, Xiuwu, Huojia, Wuzhi, Bo'ai and other places in the fourth district of northern Henan are excitedly celebrating the re-liberation and the beginning of the establishment of a democratic order. Jiaozuo, Mulandian (Wuzhi New City), Xiuwu, Huojia and other cities quickly established garrison headquarters and organized investigation teams, while the rural areas organized armed work teams to eliminate the remaining enemy and puppet armed forces. Mass meetings, meetings of industrialists and businessmen, intellectuals, and former Baojia chiefs were held everywhere to publicize our army's great autumn offensive and explain our party's various policies in detail. Due to the correct implementation of our party's policies, the enemy and puppet personnel and the people in the enemy-occupied areas were given a good impression. The scattered armed forces of the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops have gradually understood the policy of "as long as they surrender their weapons, the democratic government will treat them leniently." Therefore, the restoration work has achieved the following results: the remaining scattered enemy troops and puppet self-defense forces in the urban and rural areas of Xiuwu, Wuzhi, and Jiaozuo have handed over nine light machine guns, more than 470 long and short guns, and 20 boxes of bullets. More than 500 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet personnel in Jiaozuo and Xiuwu have voluntarily registered with the democratic government. The democratic government, based on the policy of rewarding those who have made contributions, not holding accomplices accountable, and punishing the main culprits, has dealt with them separately. In Jiaozuo City, Mulandian, and Xiuwu City, after being destroyed by the enemy, only about 490 large and small shops remained, of which 444 have opened for business. Shops in the county and city market towns have also begun to operate. In Wuzhi City and Jiaozuo City, two public and private normal schools and twelve complete primary schools have resumed classes with the active support of the democratic government.
    In order to further accelerate the establishment of democratic and production order, the Taihang Fourth District Committee of the Communist Party of China recently decided on the current work tasks and methods for the newly recovered urban and rural areas: (1) Continue to widely publicize the victorious situation and the policies of protecting the lives and property of the people of all classes, protecting and developing industry and commerce, and uniting and transforming intellectuals, so as to dispel their various ideological concerns and carry out a production self-rescue movement. The main focus in the cities is to restore industry and commerce, and in the rural areas it is to mobilize, organize and help the masses to rush to plant wheat and vigorously engage in sideline production. (2) Strengthen public security work, eliminate the remaining enemy and puppet armed forces, and thoroughly stabilize social order; to this end, it is necessary to quickly and universally rectify and establish people's armed forces (including militia self-defense forces), overcome the paralysis and complacency of village cadres and militia activists who despise the remaining enemy and puppet forces, actively carry out public security work, and implement propaganda and correctly implement the lenient policy, continue to call on and urge Chiang Kai-shek and puppet personnel to register with the democratic government to repent and surrender their weapons; the main reactionary saboteurs should be punished according to law, and it is strictly forbidden to arbitrarily arrest and kill people and seize property and other phenomena. (3) Establish war service work to support the front line. (4) Rural areas must gradually transform village-level political power. The decision emphasized that this stage of restoration work is quite arduous and complicated, and the party, government, army and people must work together and redouble their efforts to complete it victoriously.

    为进一步加速建立民主与生产秩序，中共太行四地委特于日前决定了当前新收复城乡的工作任务与作法：（一）继续广泛宣传胜利形势与保护各阶层群众生命财产、保护发展工商业、团结改造知识分子等政策，以解除其各种思想顾虑，开展生产自救运动。城市主要是恢复工商业，农村是发动组织与扶助群众突击种麦与大力搞副业生产。（二）加强治安工作，肃清敌伪武装残余，彻底安定社会秩序；为此必须迅速普遍整顿与建立人民武装（包括民兵自卫队），克服村干民兵积极分子轻视敌伪残余力量的麻痹太平思想，积极开展治安工作，并贯彻宣传与正确执行宽大政策，继续号召与督促蒋伪人员向民主政府登记悔过，交出武器；对首要反动破坏分子，应依法惩处，严禁随便捕人杀人与乱抓资财等现象。（三）建立战勤工作，支援前线。（四）农村必须逐渐改造村级政权。决定中强调指出：这一段恢复工作是相当艰苦与繁杂的，党政军民必须协同一致加倍努力，才能胜利完成。
