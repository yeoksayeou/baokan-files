　　Heroic Deeds on the Production Front
    Zhan Chao
    The working people of Shijiazhuang, especially the workers, are creating heroic achievements on the production front with unprecedented enthusiasm, competing with the brave soldiers at the front who are valiantly killing the enemy. Here are a few brief stories.
    Zhang Yongnian, the leader of the Guanzi Room team at the 302 Factory, started working on October 6th when a certain furnace was officially loaded with coal. He worked all day, and it was time for him to get off work, but the power room worker, Xu Lianhe, was sick, so he voluntarily took his place. He continued to work until dawn the next day. He had already worked for twenty-four consecutive hours, but because the initial installation task was not completed, Zhang Yongnian refused to give up. After finishing breakfast, he voluntarily went to work connecting pipes, continuing until noon when he finished the entire installation task. Liu Hongyin, a worker at the Yumin Flour Mill, loaded 195 bags of wheat in one night and carried 40 buckets of water upstairs, doing the work of two and a half people. Zhang Jia＠, a worker at a certain power plant, wrote an article titled "Intensive Assault for Three Days and Nights," describing the situation during a certain emergency repair of machinery in their factory, saying: "At 9 p.m. on November 11th, strong sparks occurred between the brush and the commutator segments. Although several inspections and repairs were made, no effect was achieved. By the night of the 13th, the sparks became even more intense, radiating red light and crackling. It looked like the commutator and carbon brushes had suffered severe damage. At 2 a.m. on the 14th, we had to stop the machine for repairs. Because several repairs had not been effective, it was estimated that it would be a difficult project that could not be completed in a short time. At the same time, the 17th was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and electricity consumption during the holiday would inevitably increase, so it had to be repaired before the festival. Therefore, from the time the machine was stopped on the morning of the 14th, all the factory workers worked day and night to rush the repair. Yuan Che of the repair team worked day and night to spin the commutator, and Xu Wenbin, the head of the machine team, personally made carbon brushes. The whole factory was engaged in an intensive assault. After three days and two nights of hard work, the commutator was spun well, the grooves were opened, and after drying, it was reinstalled on the generator. The old hard carbon was replaced with soft carbon. At 9:30 p.m. on the 16th, the entire project was completed and tested, but the result was still sparks. To avoid burning the machine, the factory director ordered the machine to be stopped, and the entire factory was shrouded in a gloomy atmosphere. Although the factory director announced that each department should leave a few people on duty, and the rest should go home to sleep, most people stared with tired eyes and refused to leave the machine. Another group of technicians and workers were unwilling to give up and were still looking for the problem. Suddenly, technicians Liu Shihe and Gu Xiang exclaimed, "The problem is here!" It turned out that a wire end had opened the weld due to high-speed rotation and vibration, breaking the circuit. Because the break was in the corner of the edge, it was difficult to find. At this time, worker Xiong Yinhong immediately burned the copper solder and soldered the wire end, and then inspected it one by one. "It's fixed!" The workers present all cheered loudly, "We will start the machine, we will send power!" Without waiting for the factory director's order, they automatically gathered those who could be gathered. At 3:15, the machine started running, and at 4:45, the switch was closed and power was sent. The factory inside and outside were filled with light. At dawn, although people had worked continuously for several days and nights, they all had red eyes and smiling faces." The story created by several telephone operators written by Comrade Lu Dao is also a typical one: "In the material shed of the first engineering team of the ×× Bridge, filled with various materials and tools, there are two tables, one is a telephone table, and the other is a table for learning and studying problems. When work is not too busy, telephone operators Wang Dongshun, electrician Xu Dunhua, Yang Fululu, Shao Kongcheng, and nurse Shen Fusan sit at the table and study and learn attentively. Some draw circuit diagrams, some discuss principles, and some copy medical notes. Their interest in research is very strong, and each person has an exercise book and a neat notebook, which are filled with small characters and drawings of circuit diagrams and telephone structures. Each of them is a teacher and a student, consciously researching each other, and they have made new creations in the improvement of the engineering team's telephone. The engineering team's telephone has three lines: a dedicated line, a station line, and a dispatch line. Usually, the dedicated line is hung up. If the engineering locomotive wants to contact the dispatch station, it has to change to the dispatch line, which is very troublesome to use. If the telephone operator is not there, the person making the call has no way to do it. In order to reduce the switching time and facilitate use, telephone worker Wang Dongshun and electrician Yang Fululu and Shao Kongcheng carefully studied the telephone principle. They used three discarded electric switches on the telephone to turn them into telephone line switches. Three lines are plugged into the telephone: if you want to use the dedicated line, close the ground line switch and then turn the second switch to the dedicated line; if you want to use the station line, just turn the second switch horizontally to the station line; if you want to switch to the dispatch line, pull open the ground line switch, also pull open the second switch, and then close the third switch. This is very easy and fast, and it is much more convenient for comrades making calls. This creation has made a great contribution to the communication work. One telephone can make calls on three lines, and everyone praises it. Their learning enthusiasm is even higher, and their research interest is also higher." In an emergency, in order to protect their factory, the workers even bravely went to put out the fire, risking the enemy's bombing. Here is Comrade Chen Sen's eyewitness account: With a crash, an airplane scraped past the roof. An old lady in the cave cried anxiously, "Lao Zhang, come down!" But Lao Zhang still vigilantly stared at the sky. At this time, a strange noise of "swoosh" sounded, and a bomb fell down. Lao Zhang's eyes flashed with fire, thinking, "This is bad!" He looked up and saw that the factory was fine. In the blink of an eye, another one fell, and flames more than a foot high burst out from the door of the south workshop. Lao Zhang couldn't think of anything else, and with a leap, he ran straight to the fire. When he ran to the front of the house, a smell of sulfur rushed to his nose. He was anxious and started grinding his teeth. He saw a shovel at a glance, shoveled soil and covered the fire. Just as the fire on the door was extinguished, a burst of gunfire of "scrape, scrape, scrape" forced Lao Zhang to quickly squat down at the base of the wall. But in a blink of an eye, he saw that the grass at the door was burning again with a "whoosh" sound. He forgot everything, and he couldn't even hear the sound of the machine gun. He ran over and covered it with soil again, and the fire was extinguished.
    The enemy plane flew away, and people rushed out, all worried that their houses and belongings would be burned. They were afraid that Lao Zhang would be injured. Everyone ran over and saw that Lao Zhang was holding the shovel, still standing there wiping sweat. An old lady said with gratitude and reproach, "Aren't you afraid of death, Lao Zhang!" Lao Zhang said, "Afraid of death? What will happen if the house and furniture are burned!"
    Liu Dagezi came out from the north courtyard, looked at Lao Zhang, and said, "If it weren't for you, we would have been killed today!" Lao Zhang, breathing heavily and blushing, shouted, "Go and start the machine, don't delay!" So the motor in the north courtyard immediately roared and started up again. The machine seemed to be singing even more happily than before.

　　生产战线上的英雄业迹
    展潮
    石家庄的劳动人民，尤其是工人，正在以历来未有的积极性创造着生产战线上的英雄业迹。以与前方将士的英勇杀敌作竞赛。下面是几个片断的故事。
    三○二工厂工人管子房班长张永年，从十月六日白天某火炉正式装煤时干起，整整干了一天，本来该他下班了，但是动力房工友徐连和病了，他又自动顶班，一直顶到第二天天亮，本来已连续干了二十四个钟头，但因初步的安装任务没有完成，张永年说什么也丢不下手，刚吃罢早饭，又自动上班接管子，直干到中午下班后完成全部安装任务为止。裕民面粉厂工人刘鸿印，一夜上小麦一百九十五包，还提四十桶水上楼，一个人做了平常两个半人的工作。某发电厂工作者张嘉＠以“紧张突击三昼夜”为题，描写他们工厂某次突击抢修机器时情况说：“十一日下午九时，在刷子和整流子片间发生了强烈的火花，虽经几度检查和修整迄未发生效果，到十三日夜，火花更形剧烈，红光四射，拍拍作响，眼看整流子和炭精刷子遭受了严重的烧毁，十四日晨二时只好停车检修。因为已经几次修理都未见效，估计一定是个艰巨的工程，不是短时间所能完成的；同时十七日就是中秋节，节日用电势必增多，必须在节前赶修完毕。所以自十四日晨停车时起，全厂职工便不分日夜全力加工赶修。修理股的元车日夜赶着旋整流子，机器股长许文斌，亲自动手作炭精刷子，全厂都在紧张突击。经过三天两夜的努力，将整流子旋好了，开好了槽，经过烤干，重新装到发电机上，把旧硬质炭精换成了软的，十六日下午九时半，全部完竣试车，但结果仍然是火花迸发。为了免除烧毁机器，厂长乃下令停车，全厂顿时为忧郁的空气笼罩了。虽然厂长宣布各部留下少数人值班，其余的人回家睡觉，但是大多数人却睁着疲倦的眼，围着机器不肯走，另一部分技师和工人，也不甘心，仍在那里找毛病。忽然，技师刘时和、顾翔怪叫起来说：“问题在这里了！”原来是有一根线头经高速的回转和振动开了焊，断了电路，因为断处在边缘的角落里，很难发现。这时工友熊印红便马上烧烙铜，焊线头，随又逐一检验。“好了！”在场的职工们全大声欢呼起来，“我们就开车，我们就送电”，不等厂长下令，　便自动的把那些能够集拢起来的集拢起来，三点十五分，机器转动了，四点四十五分合闸送电了。厂内外充满了光明。天亮了，人们虽然连续几昼夜的劳作，却都红着眼睛，面带笑容。”鲁岛同志写的几个电话员创造的故事，也是一个典型：“在××大桥第一工程队的满堆各种材料和工具的材料棚里，放着两张桌子，一张是电话桌，另一张是学习和研究问题的桌子，在工作不太忙的时候，电话员王东顺、电力员许敦化、杨福禄、邵孔成和护士申福三几个就坐在桌旁用心的研究和学习，有的画电流图，有的讨论原理，有的抄医学笔记。他们研究的兴趣非常浓厚，每人都有练习簿和整整齐齐的笔记本，上面都写满小字，画着电流图表与电话机构造图。他们每人都是老师，又都是学生，自觉的互相研究，并在工程队电话的改进上有了新的创造。工程队的电话有三条线，分专线，各站线，调度线，平时挂着专用线，如工程机车向调度所联络，得改调度线，用时很麻烦，如果电话员不在，打电话的就没有办法。为了减少换线时间，运用方便起见，电话工友王东顺和电力工友杨福禄、邵孔成三人悉心研究根据电话原理，他们把三个废电闸用在电话上变成电话的线路闸。电话上插着三条线：若用专线，把地线闸关上，再把第二闸拨到专线上；若用各站线，只须把第二闸再横到各站线上；若再改用调度线，把地线闸拉开，第二闸也拉开，再把第三闸关上，这样很省事，又快，打电话的同志就方便多了，这个创造对联络工作贡献很大，一个电话机，能打三条线的电话，大家都很称赞，他们的学习情绪更高了，研究兴趣也更高了。”在紧急关头为着保卫自己的工厂，工人甚至在冒着敌机狂炸去英勇救火，下面是陈森同志的目击记：哗啦啦的一声响，一架飞机从房顶上擦过去了。洞里一个老太太急得要哭似的叫道：“老张，快下来吧！”但老张还是机警的瞪着天空。这时搜的一声怪响，一颗炸弹落了下来，老张眼里冒了火心想：“这下坏了！”他抬头一望，厂子没事，没眨眼的功夫又落下来一颗，南边工房门上火头冒出一尺多高。老张什么也顾不得想，一踊身，直奔起火地方跑去。跑到房跟前，一股硫磺味冲鼻而来，他急的打磨，一眼看见把铁锹，铲上土就往火上盖。门上火刚扑灭，“刮刮刮”一阵扫射，逼得老张赶快蹲到墙根下。但他一转眼，看见门口的草又呼呼的着起来了，他什么也忘了，机枪声也好象听不见了，奔过去又是盖了一阵土，火扑灭了。
    敌机飞走了，人们一拥而出，谁都担心自己房子家当别被烧光了，老张别受了伤。大家跑过去一看，老张按着锹，还站在那里直擦汗。一个老太太连感激带责备的说：“你就不怕死呀，老张！”老张说：“怕死？着了房子着了家具怎么办哪！”
    刘大个子从北院出来，看看老张，说：“不是你，今天可就要了命啦！”老张喘呼呼的红着脸嚷道：“快去开车吧，别误了！”于是北院马达，立刻又隆隆的开动了，机器好象比以前唱得更欢。
