　　Statement from the Headquarters Spokesperson of the China Democratic League
  　Expelling Democratic Traitor Zhang Shenfu
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th】 Democratic traitor Zhang Shenfu has been expelled from the China Democratic League by the headquarters. According to a Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao report on October 31st: Zhang Shenfu recently published an article entitled "Appeal for Peace" in the magazine *Observation*. The spokesperson for the Hong Kong headquarters of the China Democratic League issued the following statement in response: "League member Zhang Shenfu has repeatedly violated the political positions of our League. The Fourth Expanded Joint Conference of the Hong Kong Central Executive Committee and the Central Offices unanimously resolved to expel him from the League. The reason is that on January 2nd of this year, Zhang Shenfu publicly published a joint announcement in the Beiping *World Daily*, supporting Tang Siyao, the vice-speaker of the Beiping Senate of the Kuomintang, in his election as a legislator. This is tantamount to openly recognizing the legitimacy of the pseudo-National Assembly, the pseudo-Constitution, and the election of the pseudo-legislators. Furthermore, he published absurd remarks in the ninth issue of the fifth volume of *Observation*. His words and actions have clearly embarked on an anti-people and anti-democratic path. In order to implement its consistent political stance, our League has expelled him from the League to maintain discipline."

　　民盟总部发言人声明
  　开除民主叛徒张申府
    【新华社陕北十四日电】民主叛徒张申府已被民盟总部开除盟籍。据香港大公报十月三十一日消息：张申府最近在观察杂志发表“呼吁和平”一文，香港民盟总部发言人，特为此发表声明如下：“本盟盟员张申府迭次违反本盟之政治主张，已经在港中执委暨中央各处会第四次扩大联席会议中一致决议：予以开除盟籍之处分。其理由为张申府于本年一月二日在北平世界日报公开刊登联名启事，拥护国民党北平参议会副议长唐嗣尧竞选立法委员，此无异公开承认伪国大伪宪法以及伪立法委员之选举为合法。又于观察杂志第五卷第九期发表荒谬言论，其言行显已走上反人民反民主之道路，本盟为贯彻历来之政治主张，特将其盟籍开除以维纪律。”
