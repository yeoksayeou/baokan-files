From Northern Yue News:

    At the Northern Yue District's production conference in February this year, the water conservancy plans set by each special district and county were to expand irrigation by 123,000 mu based on the 150,739 mu irrigated by the nine major canals last year, and to construct small-scale water conservancy projects to irrigate an additional 20,000 mu, totaling over 140,000 mu. By the time of the second production conference in May, due to insufficient water volume, excessively large projects, and inadequate preparation for the nine major canals, the original plan was revised to eight major canals, expanding irrigation by 101,070 mu. Small-scale water conservancy projects were also revised to expand irrigation by over 30,000 mu, and to expand irrigation by 10,000 mu by installing and repairing waterwheels. Over the past seven months, according to incomplete statistics, the Rongzhen, Lingzheng, Ji San, Limin, Dongsheng, Puji, and Agriculture seven major canals (statistics for the Wanxiang and Puji canals in the Second Special District are not included), originally required to expand irrigation by 96,070 mu, actually expanded irrigation by 43,090 mu, completing 45 percent of the plan. Only the Limin Canal exceeded the plan by 3 percent. For small-scale water conservancy projects, originally planned to expand irrigation by 30,000 mu, excluding the Second Special District, 12 counties including Fanshi and Xingtang newly repaired 60 old canals, irrigating 46,854 mu, exceeding the plan by 55 percent. The original plan was to expand irrigation by 10,000 mu by installing and restoring waterwheels, and only over 600 waterwheels lent by the former Jin-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Water Conservancy Promotion Society to the Fourth and Fifth Special Districts have played a role. With each waterwheel expanding irrigation by 15 mu, a total of 9,000 mu were expanded. Xingtang County alone organized the masses to repair over 2,000 waterwheels, of which over 700 were significantly repaired and restored, expanding and restoring irrigation by at least 7,000 mu or more. The total is 16,000 mu, exceeding the original plan by 60 percent. The above three items totaled 105,944 mu of expanded irrigation, completing 79 percent of the original plan. For flood control and drainage projects, 12 counties including Hunyuan and Qi County repaired dikes, built dams, and repaired old dams in 98 locations, protecting 71 villages and over 100,000 mu of land. In terms of leadership and water conservancy organization management, this spring, all major canals were equipped with cadres and assisted with loans of over 300,000 jin of grain. Although there was no preparation last winter, they also ensured timely water release, irrigation, and silt deposition. According to incomplete statistics from the First Sub-district, over 50,000 mu were silted. In earnestly implementing the principle of people-run projects, Fanshi's 56 administrative villages and 88 larger canals (over 100 mu) established and improved organizational leadership and water usage burden systems. The ten new canals that were not completed last year also silted 5,259 mu this year, and 19 collapsed old canals were restored, silting 1,743 mu. The Laizhuo West River water conservancy underwent preliminary transformation, with 37 water gates built and improved water usage methods, expanding water conservancy by 13,000 mu. The Fourth Sub-district's river management and the Tang River in Tang County, when water volume was extremely scarce, the leadership unified the regulation of water volume, which played a significant role.

    北岳认真兴建水利扩大水田十万余亩
    【北岳讯】北岳区今年二月生产会议上，各专县订的水利计划，是将九道大渠在去年浇地十五万七百三十九亩的基础上，再扩大十二万三千亩，修小的水利灌溉二万亩，共十四万多亩。至五月二次生产会议时，九道大渠因水量不足，工程过大，准备不足等原因，曾将原计划修改为八道大渠，扩大浇地十万一千七十亩，小的水利也改为扩大浇地三万多亩，按制水车和整修水车，扩大浇地一万亩。七个月来，据不完整统计，荣臻、灵正、计三、利民、东胜、普济、农业七道大渠（二专完襄、普济渠未统计），原要求扩大浇地九万六千零七十亩，实扩大浇地四万三千零九十亩，完成计划百分之四十五。只有利民渠超过计划百分之三。小的水利原计划扩大浇地三万亩，除二专未计外，繁峙行唐等十二县新修复旧水渠六十道，浇地四万六千八百五十四亩，超过计划百分之五十五。按装水车和恢复水车原计划扩大浇地一万亩，仅前晋察冀边区水利推进社贷到四、五专已发挥作用的水车有六百余架，每架扩大浇地十五亩计，共扩大浇地九千亩；行唐一县组织群众整修水车二千多架，其中大整补恢复的有七百余架，扩大与恢复浇地至少也在七千亩以上。合计一万六千亩，超过原计划百分之六十。以上三项共扩大浇地十万五千九百四十四亩，完成原计划百分之七十九。防洪和泄水工程，浑源、其县等十二县修堤、筑坝、整补旧坝九十八处。可护村七十一个，护地十万亩以上。在领导和水利组织管理上，今春各大渠都配备了干部，贷粮三十多万斤加以帮助。虽然去冬未准备，也都保证了按时放水、灌溉和放淤。据一分区不完整统计，放淤五万亩以上。在认真贯彻民办方针上，繁峙五十六个行政村八十八道较大的渠道（百亩以上），建立与健全了组织领导和使水负担制度办法，仅去年未完成的十道新渠，今年也放淤五千二百五十九亩，使十九道垮台的旧渠恢复起来，放淤一千七百四十三亩。涞涿西河水利进行了初步的改造，建水闸三十七个，改良使水办法，扩大水利一万三千亩。四分区治河、唐县唐河，于水量奇缺时，领导上统一调剂水量，起了很大作用。
