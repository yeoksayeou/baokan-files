Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th--Due to the Kuomintang government's "currency reform," prices have soared, and the salaries of public school teachers and staff have been reduced, making it difficult for them to make a living. They have launched strikes and protests. According to an Associated Press report on the 26th, following the strike by more than 4,000 elementary school teachers in Beiping against hunger, the entire faculty and staff of Beiping Normal University have launched a five-day strike, demanding a two-month salary loan and the convenience of purchasing grain, fuel, and other daily necessities at the August 19th "debt limit" price. Professors at Peking University have also launched an anti-hunger strike, and students at the university held a sympathy strike on the 25th in support of the professors' demands. The university's workers have also demanded a loan of 100 "gold yuan" per person, or they will hold a strike within the week. Assistant teachers and lecturers at Tsinghua University have decided to launch a five-day strike simultaneously.

According to the Tianjin Dagong Bao on the 14th, some school canteens in Tianjin have announced closures due to food shortages, and the student canteens of Beiyang and Nankai Universities are on the verge of running out of food. Some students have spent three nights queuing to buy corn flour, leaving them exhausted and falling asleep in class.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st--Due to the various reactionary economic measures of the Kuomintang government after the "currency reform," the lives of workers, teachers, and students in its controlled areas are seriously threatened. Now, transportation workers in Tianjin and Beiping are launching anti-hunger struggles, and the resistance movements of teachers and students are expanding. According to various reports, drivers and conductors of buses and streetcars in Tianjin held a meeting on the afternoon of October 27th to protest the freezing of labor costs after the "currency reform" and demand the implementation of in-kind salary payments, bringing traffic in the city to a standstill. Three thousand telecommunications workers in Beiping have launched a "slowdown" strike, stopping all receiving and dispatching except for news and official telegrams. They demand two bags of flour per month, coal for the winter, and a loan of 300 "gold yuan." On October 24th, Kuomintang customs employees in Tianjin launched a work slowdown, demanding the advance payment of three months' salary, the restoration of pre-"currency reform" subsidies for rice, and an increase in the salaries of lower-level employees.

At the same time, the number of faculty and staff members participating in the anti-hunger strikes at Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Beiping Normal College continues to increase. Faculty and staff members at Nankai University in Tianjin also began a three-day strike on October 27th. Among the three universities in Beiping that are holding strikes, in addition to Peking University students who held a strike on October 25th, students from Tsinghua University and Beiping Normal College have also risen up in response, supporting the faculty and staff's demands for improved living standards and fighting to improve their own living conditions.
