[Beiyue Electric] Under the powerful autumn offensive of the People's Liberation Army, the enemy in the isolated strongholds along the Ping-Sui Railway Line are in a state of panic. The enemy troops in Beiping are also entirely shrouded in a shadow of war-weariness. In addition, with the advancement of our political offensive, enemy desertions are increasing. From October 15th, in less than ten days, the three districts of Tianzhen County alone received 45 Yan-Fu soldiers from Huai'an, Chaigoubao, Yongjiabao, and Datong. The Wanping KMT-Fu Army surrender reception center received 28 surrendered soldiers in the half-month from October 25th to November 7th. Some of them were from the 205th Division of the bandit Youth Army, newly transferred from Taiwan, and some were from the training corps of the 6th Training Department of the 6th Army, stationed in the suburbs of Beiping. Chen Xinwu, a soldier from the latter unit who deserted on the 3rd, was from Huoqiu, Anhui. He said that those receiving training were all newly conscripted soldiers who did not want to die for the KMT traitors. Despite the close surveillance of the surrounding guard troops, desertions in twos and threes were frequent. Recently, more than a dozen soldiers from his company deserted in the past month. He also mentioned that once, three platoon leaders in his company were reading the newspaper together and, upon seeing the news of the surrender of the Kuomintang bandit army in Changchun, said, "The Communist Party wins battles because they have the support of the people. We are fighting a traitorous war, and we are bound to fail." Within a few days, one of them, the second platoon leader, Li Hewen, deserted. Surrendered soldier Zheng Shuyun was from the cart company of the supply battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the Youth Army 205th Division. He said, "Our company was stationed in Dayu, and more than 50 people deserted in less than three days. Now there are only more than 60 people left in the entire company." According to Wei Xiachu, a sergeant clerk of the regiment, their regiment had a strength of 3,600 when they set out from Taiwan with American equipment. Many deserted along the way, and after being stationed in Dayu, more than 500 deserted again within a few days. Now there are only more than 2,000 people left. Finally, with a self-reproaching tone, he confessed with great remorse: "I am a middle school student, originally from Boxian, northern Anhui, and my family ran a business in the county town. When the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yellow River and arrived in my hometown, I did not understand the policies of the Communist Party. Coupled with the rumors and deceptions of the Kuomintang bandit gang, my whole family was forced to flee to Shangqiu, Henan. The KMT bandits soon conscripted me into the 75th Division and then transferred me to Taiwan for training. There, I saw American advisors and saw these American robbers bully the Chinese people and rape Chinese women. I was assigned to the 205th Division and, after being transported to North China, I inquired about the policies of the Liberated Areas and saw that others were constantly surrendering to the People's Liberation Army. Only then did I make up my mind to escape the traitorous and oppressive bandit lair. I hope that the Communist Party will win victory and defeat the KMT bandits as soon as possible, liberate all of China, and I am willing to fulfill my due responsibility."

[Beiyue, 20th Dispatch] The Fu bandits entrenched along the Ping-Sui Railway line, shaken by the continuous victories of our People's Liberation Army on various battlefields, are fleeing to the liberated areas one after another. According to statistics from the 6th sub-district KMT-Fu Army reception center alone, from the beginning of October to November 10th, a period of 40 days, it received 399 KMT-Fu soldiers, who brought with them various weapons, including one light machine gun, ten rifles, two pistols, and over 800 rounds of ammunition.

　　平绥线各孤立据点
  　蒋军厌战逃跑日多
    【北岳电】在人民解放军强大秋季攻势震慑下，平绥线各孤立据点敌人终日恐慌不安。北平敌军亦为厌战情绪的阴影所整个笼罩。加之我政治攻势的开展，敌逃亡愈来愈多。从十月十五日起，不到十天的工夫，仅天镇城关三个区，即收容怀安、柴沟堡、永嘉堡及大同等地阎傅军四十五名。宛平蒋傅军投诚官兵招待所，从十月二十五到本月七日的半月内，即收容投诚士兵二十八人。他们有的来自新由台湾调来的匪青年军二零五师，有的来自驻扎平郊的匪六军第六训练处补训总队。三日逃来的该部士兵陈信武系安徽霍邱人，六月由上海航运天津转平郊六军第六训练处补训总队受训，据他谈：受训的都是被抓来的新兵，谁也不愿意为蒋贼卖命，虽有周围警戒部队的严密监视，三三两两开小差的时有所闻，最近一个月他们团里那个连也逃亡一十来个。有一次他们连上的三个排长在一起看报，看到长春国民党匪军投降的消息时说：“共产党得民心就打胜仗，我们打的是卖国仗，非败不可。”不几天其中的一个二排长李何文就逃跑了。投诚士兵郑树云是青年军二零五师二团补给营大车连，他说：“我们连驻扎大峪，不到三天就逃亡五十多人，现在全连还剩六十多人了。”据该团文书上士魏霞初说：他们这一团由台湾开拔时是美国编制，共三千六百人，沿路就逃跑不少，驻防大峪后不几天又跑了五百多人。现在还剩两千多人了，最后他带着谴责自己的口吻十分忏悔的说：“我是个中学生，原籍皖北亳县，家在县城做买卖，解放军渡黄河到达家乡时，我不了解共产党的政策，加上国民党匪帮的造谣欺骗，害得我全家逃难到河南商邱，蒋匪不久就把我征入七十五师后转调台湾受训，在那里我看到了美国顾问，也看到了这些美国强盗欺侮中国人，强奸中国妇女。我被编入二零五师，运到华北后，就打听了解放区的政策，看到了别人不断的投诚解放军，这才下了决心逃出了卖国残民的匪帮营垒，我希望共产党早日胜利打垮蒋匪，解放全中国，我也愿尽一份应尽的责任。”
    【北岳二十日电】盘据平绥线的傅匪，在我人民解放军各战场连续获胜的震撼下，纷纷逃来解放区，仅据六分区蒋傅官兵招待所从十月初至十一月十日四十天统计，即收容蒋傅官兵三百九十九名，并带来武器多种，计轻机枪一挺、步枪十支、手枪两支、子弹八百余发。
