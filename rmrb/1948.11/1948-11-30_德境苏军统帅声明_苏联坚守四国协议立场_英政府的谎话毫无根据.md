Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: TASS Berlin Dispatch: On November 19th, Marshal Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany, issued a statement at a press conference refuting the British government's reply to the letters from Evatt, Chairman of the Third Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and UN Secretary-General Lie regarding the Berlin issue. The statement pointed out that the reply contained groundless assertions, namely that the breakdown of the four-power governors' negotiations in September was because the Soviet government "did not comply with the agreement reached between the Western powers' representatives and Premier Stalin in Moscow to give instructions to its Berlin Commander-in-Chief." The statement announced: This assertion has been refuted by well-known facts. The fact is that the Soviet Commander adhered to the position of the Four-Power Agreement in the negotiations from August 31st to September 7th this year. This position of the Soviet Command has been clearly and faithfully explained to the world in its statement on October 2nd, which remains the only document regarding the Berlin negotiations.

The statement continued: On the other hand, it is significant that the British government did not even include the recommendations of the British Commander in Berlin on financial and other issues in the so-called "White Paper" published by the British Foreign Office. The reason for this is that the recommendations of the British Berlin Command greatly violated the principles in the directives of the four governments of August 30th this year. This once again proves that the British Berlin Command did not endeavor to reach an agreement on the basis of the August 30th directive, although the British government representative also signed this directive. All of the above proves that the British government's attempts to defend their position on the Berlin issue by fabricating various lies about the Soviet Command in Germany are groundless. It should be pointed out that the main shortcoming of the Western countries' position on the Berlin issue is their complete unwillingness to take into account the interests of the Soviet occupation zone in resolving the Berlin currency issue. They are unwilling to understand, or pretend not to understand, that if it were not for the separate currency reform in West Germany and the use of a second currency in West Berlin, which seriously endangered the economic interests of the Soviet occupation zone, then the Soviet side would not have needed to take those restrictive measures on traffic between Berlin and the Western occupation zones. Needless to say, the Soviet Union has always strived to earnestly resolve the Berlin issue in accordance with mutual interests and existing international agreements, as indicated by the Soviet government's reply to Evatt and Lie on November 16th this year, and by the Soviet delegation head's attitude of approving the mediation efforts of the President of the Security Council, Bramuglia.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, 22nd: TASS: The Progressive Party released a letter from Wallace to Truman, requesting Truman to reconsider the proposal by Evatt and Lie, which was rejected by Marshall, regarding the resolution of the Berlin dispute. Wallace's letter stated: "Lie and Evatt's proposal is a practical answer to the United Nations' continuous failure to seek a resolution to the Berlin situation. Taking positive action on this proposal will help consolidate the United Nations. The proposal acknowledges that the Berlin issue cannot be resolved within the United Nations. Marshall's note merely returns the issue to the Security Council, which has already failed to find a solution. The result of this approach can only be another long-term deadlock. Rejecting the direct negotiations proposed by Lie and Evatt cannot but be a danger to peace itself."

　　德境苏军统帅声明
    苏联坚守四国协议立场
  　英政府的谎话毫无根据
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社柏林讯：十一月十九日，德境苏联占领军统帅索柯洛夫斯基元帅向记者招待会发表声明、驳斥英国政府对联合国大会第三届会议主席伊瓦特和联合国秘书长莱氏关于柏林问题函件之复文，指出该复文包含毫无根据的断言，即所谓九月间四国总督谈判的破裂，是因为苏联政府“没有遵照西方国家代表和斯大林总理在莫斯科谈判时达到的给其柏林总司令官以训令的协议”。声明宣布：这一断言已为众所周知的事实所驳斥。事实是：苏军司令在今年八月三十一日到九月七日的谈判中，坚守四国协议的立场。苏军司令部的这种立场，已在其十月二日的声明中明白而忠实地向全世界说明了，这一声明迄今仍是关于柏林谈判经过的唯一文件。
    声明继称：另一方面，有意义的是，英国政府甚至没有把柏林英军司令对财政和其他问题的建议列入英国外交部发表的所谓“白皮书”中。其所以如此，是因为柏林英军司令部的建议，大大违背今年八月三十日四国政府指令中的原则。这再次证明了柏林英军司令部并未在八月三十日指令的基础上努力达到协议，虽然英国政府代表也在这一指令上签了字。上述一切证明：英国政府以捏造各种有关德境苏军司令部的谎话，来辩解他们对柏林问题之立场的企图毫无根据。应当指出的是，西方国家在柏林问题上所持立场的主要缺点是，他们完全不愿顾及苏联占领区的利益而解决柏林货币问题。他们不愿了解，或者装做不了解，如果不是因为西德的单独货币改革，和在柏林西部使用第二种货币实在危及苏占区的经济利益，那末苏联方面便不需要采取施于柏林和西德占领区间交通的那些限制措施。无需重说，苏联是始终力求按照相互利益和现存的国际协议切实解决柏林问题的，这已由苏联政府今年十一月十六日致伊瓦特和莱氏的复文，以及由联大苏联代表团团长对安理会主席布拉玛葛里亚的调停努力所持的赞同态度所指明。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：进步党发表华莱士致杜鲁门的函件，要求杜鲁门重新考虑为马歇尔拒绝了的伊瓦特和莱氏关于解决柏林纠纷的建议。华莱士函件略称：“莱氏与伊瓦特的建议，是对联合国谋求柏林形势解决不断失败后的一个切合实际的答案，对这一建议采取积极的行动，将有助于巩固联合国。该建议的提出，系承认柏林问题不能在联合国中获得解决。马歇尔的照会，仅仅是将问题交回已经没有获得解决办法的安理会，这样做法的结果，只能是另一个长期的僵持局面。拒绝莱氏与伊瓦特所建议的直接谈判，其本身不能不成为对和平的危害。”
