Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China today issued an important statement regarding the request by the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government for military protection from the US government. The full text is as follows:

　　Chiang Kai-shek and the entire reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government are now trying to place their dying rule under the hope of US military protection. To this end, the reactionary Kuomintang government has issued a letter in Chiang Kai-shek's name to US President Truman. At the same time, Wu Guozhen, the Kuomintang mayor of Shanghai, has held talks with Vice Admiral Badger, commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet, and US Ambassador to Nanjing, Stuart, for several days. It is reported that they discussed a plan for the United States to protect Shanghai. It is also reported that the Kuomintang government plans to ask the US armed forces in Qingdao to take over the Qingdao municipal administration. The Chinese Communist Party resolutely opposes any such treasonous acts by the reactionary Kuomintang government and resolutely denies any legal effect of such treasonous acts. As early as February 1, 1947, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China declared all traitorous diplomacy of the Kuomintang government invalid. The Kuomintang government is now on the verge of collapse, and any assistance from foreign governments to the Kuomintang government, and any agreements it concludes with the Kuomintang government, will neither save the Kuomintang government's rule nor protect the interests of the foreign government. The only future for this assistance and agreement is to perish with the Kuomintang government. The Chinese Communist Party believes that any military and economic assistance from the US government and other national governments to the Kuomintang government is an act of hostility towards the Chinese nation and the Chinese people and should be stopped immediately. If the US government sends its military forces to provide either full or partial protection to the Kuomintang government, it will be an armed aggression against China's sacred territorial sovereignty, and the US government shall bear all the consequences. The Chinese Communist Party, the people's democratic government of the Chinese Liberated Areas, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are willing to establish equal and friendly relations with all foreign countries, including the United States, and protect the legitimate interests of all foreign nationals in China, including American nationals; but it must maintain the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty and not be subject to any infringement. We will resolutely and thoroughly oppose anyone who violates this solemn position.
　　　　　　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, November 21, 1948

　　坚决反对美帝武装侵略
  　中共中央发表重要声明
    任何外国政府对国民党政府的援助
    将随国民党政府迅速覆亡同归于尽
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】中国共产党中央委员会，今日就南京国民党反动政府要求美国政府给予军事保护一事发表重要声明，全文如下：
    蒋介石和整个南京国民党反动政府，现正力图把他们的垂死的统治放在希望美国的军事保护之下。为此目的，国民党反动政府，已由蒋介石出名致函美国杜鲁门总统。同时，国民党上海市长吴国桢，连日与美国西太平洋舰队司令白吉尔及美国驻南京大使司徒雷登先后举行会谈，据悉曾讨论由美国保护上海的计划。另据悉，国民党政府拟即请青岛美国武装部队接管青岛市政等情。中国共产党坚决地反对国民党反动政府任何此类的叛国行为，并坚决地否认此类叛国行为的任何法律效力。早在一九四七年二月一日，中国共产党中央委员会即已声明国民党政府一切卖国外交无效。国民党政府现已即将覆亡，任何外国政府给予国民党政府的任何援助，及其与国民党政府订立的任何协定，既不能挽救国民党政府的统治，亦不能保护该外国政府的利益。此项援助及协定之唯一前途，即为随国民党政府同归于尽。中国共产党认为：美国政府及其他国家政府对于国民党政府的任何军事的与经济的援助，乃是对于中华民族与中国人民的敌意行为，应当立即停止。美国政府如果派出其军事力量对于国民党政府实行无论是全面的或局部的保护，均为对于中国神圣的领土主权之武装侵略，其一切后果，应由美国政府担负。中国共产党，中国解放区人民民主政府及中国人民解放军愿与一切外国包括美国在内建立平等的友好的关系，并保护一切外国在华侨民包括美国侨民在内的正当利益；但是必须保持中国领土主权的完整，不受任何侵犯。凡与此庄严立场相违反者，我们将坚决地彻底地反对到底。
  　　　　　　　中国共产党中央委员会　一九四八年十一月二十一日
