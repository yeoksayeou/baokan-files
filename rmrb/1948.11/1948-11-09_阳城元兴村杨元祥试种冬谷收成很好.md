[Taiyue Electric] Yang Yuanxiang of Yuanxing Village, Sixth District, Yangcheng, has successfully trial-planted winter millet by improving farming methods. Last winter, Yang Yuanxiang of Yuanxing Village trial-planted 2.1 mu of millet and harvested 5 shi and 6 dou. In previous years, this plot of land could yield 4 shi, but this year it yielded 1 shi and 6 dou more. Yang Fengtian's one mu of spring millet, which was adjacent to his land and had the same soil quality, fertilizer, hoeing, and plowing, only yielded 1 shi and 6 sheng. Compared with Yang Yuanxiang's winter millet, it yielded 1 shi and 6 sheng less. Winter millet also produces more milled rice. Yang Yuanxiang's experience in growing winter millet: After the autumn harvest, plow the land once or twice first, and then apply fertilizer after the Beginning of Winter, preferably pen manure. Then plow and harrow it well, sow the seeds, do not step on the ridges, but harrow it flat and fine, so that the millet will not be frozen in winter and will be less susceptible to Suxin disease next year. The seeds should be plentiful, 2.5 sheng per mu. The seedlings will emerge from the soil after the ground thaws in the Awakening of Insects season of the following year. When it is time to plant spring millet during the Grain Rain season, the winter millet seedlings will have grown two or three leaves, thick and strong, and green, and can be hoed for the first time. The second and third hoeings are also ten days earlier than spring millet. The ears emerge in mid-May of the lunar calendar and are fully emerged by the beginning of the first ten days of the hottest period, about ten days earlier than spring millet. The advantages of growing winter millet, in addition to higher yields and more milled rice, are: (1) Winter is a slack farming season, and planting it can save time in the spring for processing and cultivation. (2) It can prevent spring drought from preventing planting or preventing seedlings from taking root. Winter millet stores winter and spring rainfall in the soil, and the seedlings emerge as soon as the Awakening of Insects arrives. By Grain Rain, two or three leaves have grown. (3) Strong resistance. Because the winter millet seeds are buried in the ground for a winter, locusts can be frozen to death. After the seedlings emerge, they have strong resistance, and insect pests do not easily invade. (4) It matures early and is not afraid of drought in June. Winter millet matures and is harvested early, and can also be used to plant stubble wheat. Yang Yuanxiang plans to plant four mu this winter, and the Yang Xiaozhen mutual aid group also plans to plant some as a trial.

　　阳城元兴村杨元祥试种冬谷收成很好
    【太岳电】改进耕作方法，阳城六区元兴村杨元祥试种冬谷成功。元兴村杨元祥去年冬天试种谷子二亩一分，打了五石六斗。往年这块地能打四石，今年就多打了一石六斗。连接着他地的杨凤田的一亩春谷，同样土质、粪及锄、犁等，只打了一石六斗，与杨元祥的冬谷比较，就少打一石零六升。冬谷还能多碾米。杨元祥种冬谷的经验：收秋以后，先把地耕上一两遍，过了立冬就上粪，最好上圈粪。再犁耙好，下种，不踩垄，但要耙平、耙县，使谷子冬天不致受冻，明年就少生苏心。种籽须多些，每亩二升半。第二年惊蛰地开冻以后，谷苗就透出土来。待谷雨种春谷的时候，冬谷苗就长有两三片叶，又粗又壮，绿油油的，已能锄头遍。以后锄二、三遍的时候，也都比春谷早十几天。阴历五月十几就秀穗，进头伏已秀齐，比春谷早熟十来天。种冬谷好处，除收得多、出米多外，（一）冬天是农闲时期，种上了可给春天省出时间来加工耕作。（二）可以防止春旱种不上或种了捉不住苗。冬谷因冬季的雨和春季的雨水保存在地里，一到惊蛰谷苗就出土。谷雨时已长出两三片叶。（三）抵抗力强。因为冬谷籽在地埋了一冬，蝗虫可以冻死，谷苗出土以后，抵抗力强，虫害不易侵袭。（四）熟的早，不怕六月天旱。冬谷早熟早收，还能赶种茬麦。杨元祥今冬准备种四亩，杨小真互助组也准备种一些试试看。
