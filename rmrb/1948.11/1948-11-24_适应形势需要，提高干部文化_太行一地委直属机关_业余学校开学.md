　　Adapting to the Situation and Improving Cadre Culture
    Taihang First Prefectural Committee Directly Subordinate Organs'
  　Spare-Time School Opens
    [Taihang News] In order to improve the cultural level of on-the-job cadres and meet the needs of the current political tasks, the First Prefectural Committee decided to establish an "On-the-Job Cadre Spare-Time School." Previously, the Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department and the Commissioner's Office Education Section, together with the heads of various organs, formed a preparatory committee for the spare-time school. After more than half a month of preparation, registration, testing, and class arrangement, the opening ceremony was held on the 8th of this month, and formal classes have officially started according to the plan since the 10th.

    After studying the four major documents since July, the cadres' enthusiasm for learning has been greatly improved, especially the demand for cultural learning is even more urgent. The spare-time school was prepared on this ideological foundation of cadres, and in view of the establishment of the Central Bureau spare-time school. During the preparation period, many comrades kept asking, "When will school start?" and requested to start classes quickly. When answering the question "thoughts on learning" in the entrance Chinese test, one comrade said that in order to "adapt to the great tasks of the current victorious situation," to "catch up with the needs of the current work," and to overcome "difficulties encountered in work," it is necessary to strengthen one's own learning. At the same time, they all expressed their confidence and determination in this study. Many comrades also reviewed their past studies and formulated their own future study plans. The Chinese language and arithmetic tests also greatly stimulated everyone's enthusiasm for learning.

    According to the results of the examination, classes were arranged according to different levels, including 74 people in the intermediate class (equivalent to upper primary school graduation level), 69 people in the primary class A (equivalent to lower primary school graduation level), and 60 people in the primary class B (few literate or illiterate), totaling 203 people. In addition, an advanced research group (equivalent to junior high school graduation level or above) was organized, focusing on self-study and research. The intermediate and primary classes focus on lecturing, with two hours of classes per day, focusing on cultural studies (Chinese, arithmetic, history, geography, etc.), plus a certain amount of political study. It is tentatively set for three months per semester. Teachers are selected from among the cadres of the organs. On the opening day, the students arrived very early every morning, waiting for lectures, fully demonstrating the cadres' enthusiasm for learning. In addition to the directly subordinate organs, many cadres and staff members of local primary schools, cultural cooperatives, county post offices, and senior primary schools also voluntarily signed up to participate in the study.

　　适应形势需要，提高干部文化
    太行一地委直属机关
  　业余学校开学
    【太行讯】一地委为了提高在职干部文化水平，适应当前政治任务的需要，决定成立“在职干部业余学校”。前由地委宣传部、专署教育科会同各机关负责人组成业余学校筹委会，经过半月多的筹备、报名、测验、编班，已于本月八日举行开学典礼，从十日起已按计划正式开课。
    经过七月以后的四大文件学习，大大提高了干部的学习情绪，特别是要求文化学习更为迫切。业余学校就在这个干部思想基础上，鉴于中央局业余学校的成立而进行筹备的。当筹备期间，好多同志都不断来问：“什么时候开学”，要求迅速开学上课。在入学国语测验的对学习的感想”时，一“同志都说出“适应当前胜利局面的伟大任务，”为“赶上目前工作的需要”，为克服“工作中感到困难”，都必须加强自己的学习。同时也都表示了这次学习般信心与决心。也有很多同志检讨了自己过去的学习，订出了今后自己的学习计划。经过国语、算术测验，也大大刺激了每个人的学习积极性。
    根据考试的结果。按程度分别编了班，计中级班（相当于高小毕业程度的）七十四人，初级甲班（相当于初小毕业程度的）六十九人，乙班（很少识字或文盲）六十人，共计二百零三人。另组织高级研究组（相当于初中毕业以上程度），以自学研究为主。中初两班以讲授为主，每日授课两小时，以文化（国语、算术、史地等）学习为主，加一定分量的政治学习。暂定三个月为一学期。教员由机关干部中选任。开学校，每天早晨学员都很早到齐，听候讲课，充分表现了干部学习的积极性。除直属机关外，驻地的小学教员、文化合作社、县邮局、高小等干部职员，也有不少自动报名来参加学习。（一地委宣传部　子琦）
