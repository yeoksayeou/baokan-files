Beiyue District Agricultural Experiment Station
Many Improved Varieties Successfully Tested

[Beiyue Electric] Since the Beiyue District Agricultural Technology Conference in March, the Beiyue District Agricultural Experiment Station (consisting of the Beiyue Farm in Quyang, the Xiling Farm in Yixian, and the Hengshan Farm in Hunyuan) has achieved considerable success through the efforts of spring and summer:

(1) Several good wheat varieties have been tested: The wheat hybridization breeding at the Beiyue Farm has now been harvested. According to statistical analysis, the selected varieties for the ten-row experiment of "Jian Wheat" (meaning it can be planted in both spring and autumn) are: "No. 69", "No. 118", and "No. 136". For spring wheat (bred from the Jian Wheat experiment, with good quality, high yield, and strong disease resistance): "No. 202", "No. 204", "No. 50", "No. 51", and "No. 60". The two-row experiment of "Jian Wheat" includes ten strains such as "No. 201" and "No. 20"; spring wheat also has ten strains. The autumn wheat hybridization experiment, initially planned to breed a new variety with strong resistance to jaundice and also compensate for the shortcomings of "No. 72" wheat, has harvested twelve out of sixteen ears this year, and plans to continue the experiment next year. The advanced wheat experiment, which started in 1942, has now been threshed and preliminarily analyzed. The strains that can be propagated and promoted will be determined after further review. The Xiling Farm is also actively experimenting. Last autumn, it collected 1,251 wheat ears from nearby, and after ear-row experiments, 986 were eliminated, leaving 265. An eighty-two row experiment is planned for autumn. The five-row experiments of "No. 72", "No. 817", Da Baitou (Big White Head), and Henan Bai (Henan White) varieties have been threshed and are being statistically analyzed.

(2) Barley sowing period experiment yields results: The barley sowing period in the Quyang and Fuping areas varies greatly. To determine the appropriate time, the Beiyue Farm divided the sowing period into five periods: ten days before the Spring Equinox, five days before, the Spring Equinox, five days after, and ten days after, with unified treatment. The harvest results showed that sowing before the Spring Equinox and on the Spring Equinox resulted in higher yields than sowing after the Spring Equinox. The appropriate time for barley sowing should be before or on the Spring Equinox. The yields for each different sowing period, converted to per-mu (Chinese acre) yields, are as follows: sown ten days before the Spring Equinox, 384.4 jin per mu; sown five days before, 365.6 jin per mu; sown on the Spring Equinox, 351.6 jin per mu; sown five days after, 339.1 jin per mu; sown ten days after, 265.6 jin per mu.

(3) Comparative experiment of maize (corn) and millet: The Siling Farm collected forty-one varieties from Laiyuan, Yi, Ding, Quyang, Xingtai, Lingshou, Pingshan, Laiyuan, etc., and conducted three-row experiments, five-row experiments, Latin square arrangements, etc., according to early, medium, and late maturity periods, sowing from mid-May to early June. Recent observations of the seedlings show that the Baima Ya (White Horse Tooth) corn is growing particularly well, while other varieties are less noticeable. The Hengshan Farm collected fifty-two millet varieties from Lingqiu, Fanshi, Guangling, Hunyuan, and the Border Region Farm, using the local "Yata Che" millet as a standard. After planting and checking in July, corn borers were found to be harmful in thirty-five varieties, especially in the local varieties (accounting for 2.9%). White hair disease was found in all local varieties, while foreign millet varieties have not yet been found to have it. In terms of development, the eight foreign millet varieties "Northeast Da Bai (Northeast Big White)", "Yan Qi (Yan Seven)", "Zhang Chun", "Bo Di Cu (Thin Land Coarse)", "Sha Di Guang (Sandy Land Wide)", "Ba Yi Yi (Eight One One)", "Niu Wei Huang (Cow Tail Yellow)", "Kang Han Gu (Drought Resistant Millet)", "Wan Er Shi Si Hao (Wan Twenty-Four)" and the eight local millet varieties "Huang Yu Gu (Yellow Jade Millet)", "Hei Gu (Black Millet)", "Jin Dian Yu (Gold Spot Jade)", "Guang Xin (Wide New)", "Ba Wang Bian (Overlord Whip)", "Ya Ta Che (Collapse Car)", "Yang Ti Huang (Sheep Hoof Yellow)", and "Mao Long (Hairy Dragon)" are better. The results of the above maize and millet will be analyzed after harvest and review.

　　北岳区农业试验场
  　试成不少优良品种
    【北岳电】北岳区农业试验场（计有曲阳的北岳农场，易县的西陵农场，浑源的恒山农场三处），从三月边区农业技术会议以后，经春夏两季努力，已得到不少成绩：
    （一）试验出了几样好麦种：北岳农场的小麦杂交育种，现已收获。据统计分析，当选种：有十行试验“兼小麦”（就是春秋都可种的）为：“六九号”、“一一八号”、“一三六号”三个品系。春小麦（是从兼小麦试验中育出的一种，品质好、产量大、抗病性能强）为：“二零二号”、“二零四号”、“五零号”、“五一号”、“六零号”五个品系。二行试验“兼小麦”，有：“二零一号”、“二零号”等十个品系；春小麦，也有十个品系。秋小麦杂交试验，今年初计划育成一种抗黄疸性强，而且又能补足“七二号”小麦缺点的新品种，今年共十六穗，收获了十二穗，准备明年继续试验。小麦高级试验，是从一九四二年开始，现已脱粒，并作初步分析，待继续审定以后，可决定繁殖推广的品系。西陵农场也正在积极试验，去秋共搜集附近麦种一千二百五十一穗，经穗行试验后，已淘汰九百八十六个，余二百六十五个，秋后准备开八二行试验。“七二”、“八一七”、大白头、河南白四个品种的五行试验，已进行脱粒，正在统计分析。
    （二）大麦播种期试验，已得出结果：曲阳、阜平一带，大麦播种期很不一致，为得出适宜时期，北岳农场曾分作春分前十天、前五天、春分、春分后五天、后十天五个播种期，统一待遇；经收获结果，春分前播种的和春分节播种的，都比春分后播种产量大，大麦播种适宜的时期，应在春分前或春分。各不同播种期产量折合亩斤如下：春分前十天种的每亩三八四点四斤，前五天种的每亩三六五点六斤，春分种的每亩三五一点六斤，后五天种的每亩三三九点一斤，后十天种的每亩二六五点六斤。
    （三）玉蜀黍（棒子）、谷比较试验：四陵农场从涞水、易、定、曲阳、行唐、灵寿、平山、涞源等县，采集四十一个品种，按早、中、晚三个成熟期分别以三行试验，五行试验，拉丁方排列等办法，于五月中到六月初先后播种。最近从苗株观察，白马牙棒子长的特别好，其他各种不太显著。恒山农场从灵邱、繁峙、广灵、浑源及边区农场采集谷种五十二种，以本地“压塌车”谷作标准，种上后经七月检查，发现钻心虫，在三十五种上都有危害，尤以本地品种最为严重（占百分之二点九）；白发病在本地各品种都有发现，外来谷种则还没有发现。在发育方面，尤以“东北大白”、“燕七”、“张纯”、“薄地粗”、“沙地广”、“八一一”、“牛尾黄”、“抗旱谷”、“完二十四号”八种外来谷和本地“黄玉谷”、“黑谷”、“金点玉”、“广新”、“霸王鞭”、“压塌车”、“羊蹄黄”、“毛龙”等八种较好，上述玉蜀黍、谷的结果，待收获审查后分析。
