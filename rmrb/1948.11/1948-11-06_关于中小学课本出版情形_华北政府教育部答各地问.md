　　On the Publication of Primary and Secondary School Textbooks
　　Answers from the Education Department of the North China Government to Inquiries from Various Regions
　　This newspaper has received letters from various parties inquiring about the publication and editing of textbooks for various subjects in primary and secondary schools. According to the person in charge of the Education Department of the North China People's Government: Volumes 1 to 8 of elementary school Chinese language, Volumes 1 to 4 of elementary school general knowledge, Volumes 4, 6, and 8 of elementary school arithmetic, Volumes 1 to 4 of higher elementary school Chinese language, Volumes 2 and 4 of higher elementary school arithmetic, Volumes 2 and 4 of higher elementary school nature textbooks, and Volume 1 of higher elementary school civics textbooks have all been published and are printed by the North China Xinhua Bookstore. The higher elementary school history and geography textbooks were not compiled in time this year, so as an emergency measure, the old textbooks have been slightly revised and published by the North China Xinhua Bookstore. The secondary school textbooks that have been published include: Volumes 1, 2, and 3 of secondary school Chinese language, upper and lower volumes of arithmetic, and the upper volume of the junior high school history textbook (edited by Ye Huosheng, originally published in Yan'an). The remaining Volumes 4, 5, and 6 of Chinese language, politics, Chinese and foreign history, geography, physics and chemistry, biology, algebra, geometry and trigonometry, hygiene, and other major subjects have been mostly compiled and are being printed, with some still being compiled. Efforts are being made to publish a complete set before the start of the next spring semester. Furthermore, in order to adapt to the new situation after the merger of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and Jin-Cha-Ji areas, starting from next spring, all primary and higher elementary school Chinese language textbooks (a total of twelve volumes) will be replaced with newly compiled editions, and all existing old editions in the two areas will be discarded. The revision work has been initially completed, and the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth volumes of the elementary school Chinese language textbooks have been sent for typesetting, with the remaining volumes also to be sent for typesetting successively.
