    Ping Shan Militia Deploy Minefields to Vigorously Annihilate Bandits Who Dare to Invade
    The people of Ping Shan, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, engaged in a long and brutal struggle within the enemy's pillbox network and are rich in experience. At the same time, due to the continuous victories of our armies on all fronts, they are filled with confidence in eliminating the Chiang and Fu bandit troops. However, some masses have a mentality of underestimating the enemy and being careless, believing that the enemy will not come or cannot come. This idea still needs to be overcome so that the people of the entire county can be fully mobilized to completely annihilate the bandits who dare to invade.
                                        (Zhang Chengmei)

    平山民兵布置地雷网
    准备痛歼胆敢进扰的匪徒
    平山人民于抗日战争中曾在敌人的碉堡群里进行过长期残酷的斗争，饱有经验；同时由于近日来我各线大军不断胜利，对于消灭蒋、傅匪军更充满信心。但有部分群众存在着轻敌麻痹情绪，认为敌人不会来或来不了。这种想法，还须继续克服，以便全县人民全面动员起来，把胆敢来犯的匪徒全部歼灭。
