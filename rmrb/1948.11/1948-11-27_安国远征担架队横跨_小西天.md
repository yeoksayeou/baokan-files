　　An Guo Expeditionary Stretcher Team Crosses "Little Xitian"
　　Li Yaguang, Du Zhicai
　　The An Guo stretcher team, which won the title of "Iron Labor Corps," set out with the troops at four o'clock in the morning on August 18th, heading west, to pass through the highest point in this mountainous area—"Little Xitian," a distance of fifty li up and down. The mountain road was rugged and difficult. As soon as they assembled, the annoying rain started to fall. They marched for three or four li in the rain. The advancing troops were closely packed, blocking the way, and they had to wait for two or three hours before following. The water in the river gully visibly rose by a foot, rushing southward. During the march, everyone was still like usual at the beginning, with bursts of laughter rising as someone slipped or fell into the river. People were still telling stories, encouraging each other. For example, Yuan Dacang from the Second Company, though his lips were black and purple from the cold, raised his stretcher and jumped, saying, "Let's exercise, the more we exercise, the stronger we become. Let's see who is a hero and who is a good man." An Baochang also said proudly, "We talk about enduring hardship every day, today we must endure hardship." Everyone walked and talked, unconsciously reaching the first line mountainous area with the Great Wall. The mountains became higher and higher, the rain became heavier and heavier, and difficulties pressed in on people at every step. Everyone was anxiously wishing to walk faster and reach their destination as soon as possible. The pack mules in front were stuck in the mud, and the saddles rolled down the hillside. The mountain road was narrow and impassable, and everyone needed to help lift them. At this time, the backpacks were soaked by the rain and doubled in weight. It was past noon and they hadn't climbed halfway yet. Looking back at the mountain peaks they had just climbed, they had all turned into hills or plains. The Bai River they had crossed last night seemed very close. As they climbed to the top of the mountain, another heavy downpour came, and everyone's clothes were completely soaked. Although it was early autumn, the mountains were bitterly cold and the air was thin, like winter. In addition, they had water in their stomachs, the roads were muddy, and everyone was dragging their feet, slipping and sliding. Many comrades fell and became mud men, their shoelaces broke, their shoes were lost in the mud, and they were barefoot, hopping and following closely. Everyone was shivering from the cold, and their faces had lost their color. Wang, the instructor of the Second Company, was so cold that his legs forgot to move forward and stood still. His eyes stared blankly at the messenger, Xiao Yong, and he was anxious but unable to speak, his breathing uneven. Seeing that the old instructor was in great danger, Xiao Yong and Guo Xiang hurriedly opened his backpack, took out the pants that hadn't been completely soaked, and helped him put them on. They gave him two bites of cooked food, and the situation slowly improved. Zhu Baoxiang, the deputy instructor of the Third Company, stumbled and fell down the hillside headfirst, grabbing desperately at the jujube branches. Ji Guorui, the first platoon leader, quickly pulled his legs and rescued him. There were no villages along the way. Occasionally, there was a thatched cottage on the mountainside, which was already crowded with people. It was impossible to warm up by the fire. Gradually, it was getting dark, and they hadn't eaten all day. Their stomachs were growling with hunger, and the incessant rain was getting heavier and heavier. They hadn't descended the mountain yet. But these difficulties didn't scare the laborers, nor did they stop them from advancing. The team members were still shouting to ensure that the orders were passed down and that no one fell behind. Regiment Commander Du and Political Commissar Xu called on everyone, saying: "We must not distinguish between cadres and team members, we must carry out great mutual assistance and competition, and help the weaker comrades over the mountain. This is a good opportunity to perform meritorious service!" The team members responded noisily: "Carry out great mutual assistance!..." And spontaneously formed mutual aid groups of three or five people, shouting: "We fellow villagers love each other, we will share life and death and share weal and woe..." In such a situation where they could barely take care of themselves, cadres and team members alike displayed a noble spirit of class friendship, caring for and helping each other. For example, Ma Zhida of the First Company, who was already ill, was about to faint from the cold. Old Woman Gao quickly gave him her coat to wear. Liu Baozhen of the Third Company couldn't hold on because of the cold, so Wang Ruxian quickly put a burlap sack on him and gave him cooked food to eat. Lao Pang of the Third Company was washed into the river, and Yu Fuchen quickly pulled him up and carried his things for him. Yuan Dacang of the Second Company, who had just encouraged everyone to say, "Let's exercise, the more we exercise, the stronger we become," now fell into the mud. Cui Jinmai quickly helped him up and took him to the thatched cottage at the foot of the mountain. Zheng Luoquan, Chen Junfeng, Liu Dahei, and other sick people, with the help of Wang Xingmin, Liu Zenglu, Liu Yanxi, and other comrades, were helped and carried section by section, overcoming the difficulties. The laborers not only helped each other, but also carried out great mutual assistance with the soldiers of the troops. For example, model company commander Wang Wenhan carried a soldier who had fainted from the cold for more than five li from the mountainside to the thatched cottage at the foot of the mountain, and led Jin Kui and others to rescue three or four soldiers who had fainted from the cold from the mud. Chen Jingming of the First Company put his arms around Wang Ping, a soldier who had fainted from the cold, Cui Changcheng rescued Wang Mingshan, a soldier who had fainted from the cold, Chen Honghai of the Third Company carried a soldier who had fainted from the cold across the river, Wang Guisheng carried a soldier who had fainted from the cold to a cave, and Li Yimao of the Second Company took off his jacket and gave it to Zhao Fu, a soldier who had fainted from the cold... During this climb, the laborers rescued a total of twenty-four soldiers who had fainted from the cold, and therefore also received enthusiastic help from the soldiers. For example, Yuan Ruixi of the Second Company, who had fainted from the cold, was carried by everyone to Houshanpu Village, and the comrades of the artillery company × rushed him to the warm kang. Squad leader ×× also covered him with his quilt, served him the boiled thin porridge, and said, "Soldiers and laborers are one family"; indeed, the close unity of soldiers and laborers is better than family.
　　They were helping each other, climbing up and falling down, falling down and climbing up, closely following and advancing. People were constantly shouting: "The iron stretcher team, even a mountain of knives must pass!" In this way, they helped me, and I pulled you, and they descended the mountain. By the time they reached Houshanpu Village, it was almost dawn, and the heavy rain was still falling. Everyone was soaked like a drowned chicken. Everyone was thinking of going to the house to warm up by the fire after descending the mountain, but there were many people and few houses. The people crowded in the house couldn't even stand up. Pig pens and cowsheds also became good places. Where was there room to warm up by the fire?
　　The march on the 18th will make you pay your respects to the laborers. The difficulties of rain, cold, crossing water, climbing mountains, and going hungry were completely shattered by the laborers' revolutionary will. Everyone overcame the difficulties, crossed "Little Xitian," and survived the unforgettable August 18th, victoriously completing the day and night of marching. The laborers' noble revolutionary will, great spirit of class friendship, overcame all difficulties, as strong as its name "Iron."

　　安国远征担架队横跨“小西天”
    李亚光　杜志才
    荣获“钢铁民工团”的安国担架队，于八月十八号的早四点随部队向西进军出发了，要通过这一带山区的最高点——上下够五十里地的“小西天”。山路崎岖难走，刚一集合，讨厌的雨就下起来了，冒着雨走了三四里路。前进的部队一个紧跟一个的挡住了去路，直等了两三个钟头才跟随前进。河沟的水眼看着便涨了一尺多，奔腾南流。在行进中，开始大家还和平时一样，有人滑倒或掉在河里，照样还掀起一阵杂乱的欢笑声。大家还在讲故事，互相鼓励情绪。如二连袁大仓，虽冻得唇色黑紫，还举起担架跳跃着说：“锻炼吧，越锻炼越坚强，咱们比比看，谁是英雄谁是好汉。”安保昌也昂昂的说：“一天价讲吃苦，今天就要吃苦。”大家边走边讲，不觉走上了有长城的第一线山区。山越上越高，雨也越下越大了，困难步步向人们逼近，每个人都很着急的愿走快些，赶紧到达目的地。前面的驮骡限入泥沟，马鞍滚下了山坡，山路狭隘不能过去，需要大家帮助抬扶；这时身上的背包被雨淋的都加重了一倍，天已过午还未爬过一半。回头一望刚爬过的一层山峰，都变成了丘陵或平川，昨晚渡过的白河，倒离得很近了，登上了山顶又来了一阵盆头大雨，人们的衣服全湿透了；虽然是初秋天气，但山上却冷风刺骨，空气也显得稀薄了，尤如寒冬。再加上山水过腹，道路泥泞，大家一跌一滑的拖拉着两只脚，不少同志跌倒变成了泥人，鞋带断了，鞋子丢在泥里，赤着足还一蹦蹦的紧跟着，大家都冻得发抖，面颜失去了血色；二连王指导员冻得两腿忘了前进自行立定了，两只眼呆呆的望着通讯员小永，心里着急说不出话来，呼吸也长短不匀了，眼看要冻僵在山头上，小永、国祥看老指导员非常危险，急忙把他的背包打开，拿出未湿完的裤给他穿上，让他吃了两口熟粮，情况才慢慢变好；三连副指导员朱保祥同志，猛一跋腿头朝下跌下了山坡，两手急急的揪住了酸枣枝，一排长姬国瑞忙来扯住两脚救上来。半路又无村庄，偶而山腰中有一茅舍，早已挤满了人，想烤一烤增加些暖气也是不可能的。渐渐的天已黑了，一天还没吃上饭，肚子饿的直叫唤，不停止的雨却越下越大。这时还未下山。但这些困难并没把民工们吓倒，也没阻拦住他们的前进，队员们还呐喊着要保证传下命令去，不能使后边掉队，杜团长、徐政委并号召大家说：“要不分干部队员，要开展大互助大比赛，帮助体格弱的同志过山，这正是立功的好机会！”队员们都闹吵吵的呼应着：“开展大互助！……”并自发的三三五五的结成了互助小组，乱喊叫说：“咱们老乡爱老乡，咱们要同生死共患难……”如此自顾不暇的关头，不分干部队员都发挥了高尚的阶级友爱精神，作到了互相关心互相帮助。如一连马志达本来也有些病，冻得将要晕过去，高老婆忙把本人的大衣给他穿。三连刘保贞冻的不能坚持，王儒贤忙把麻袋给他披上。还给他熟粮吃。三连老胖被水冲倒在河里，于福臣急忙把他拉起来，并替他背东西。二连袁大苍刚才还鼓励大家说：“锻炼吧，越锻炼越坚强。”现在也跌倒在泥里。崔进麦忙把他扶起揽到山下的茅舍里。郑洛犬、陈俊峰、刘大黑等病号，在王兴民、刘增禄、刘彦锡等同志扶一节背一节的互助下也渡过了困难。民工们不但作到了自己的互助，同时和部队的战士们也开展了大互助，如模范连长王文汉同志从山腰中背冻晕的战士五里多地到山下茅舍里，并带动了进魁等人从泥沟救起了冻晕的三四个战士。一连陈景明揽着冻晕的战士王平，崔长城救起了冻晕的战士王明山，三连陈红海背冻晕的战士过河，王贵生背冻晕的战士到山洞里，二连李乙卯把自己的夹袄脱下给冻晕的战士赵福穿上……。这次爬山，民工们共救护冻晕战士二十四人，因此也同样获得了战士们的热情帮助。如二连冻晕的袁瑞喜，当大家背他到后山铺村，炮兵×连的同志们忙让他到热炕头上，班长××还把自己的被子给他盖好，把熬好的稀粥盛来给他喝，并说：“战士民工是一家人”；的确战士民工的亲密团结胜过家人。
    他们在大互助着，一个个爬起又跌倒，跌倒又爬起的紧跟着前进，不断有人呐喊着：“钢铁的担架队，刀子山也得过去！”在这样你背我，我又拉你的大互助着下山了；到后山铺村天快亮了，逼人的雨还是不停，一个个淋得象水鸡，谁都心想下山后到房子里烤烤火暖暖心，可是人多房少，挤在屋里的人们立也立不开了，猪圈牛厩也成了好地方，那还有地方烤火呢？
    十八日的行军，会使你对民工们肃然起敬。淋雨、寒冷、过水、爬山、饿肚子等困难，完全被民工们的革命意志粉碎了，大家战胜了困难，跨过了“小西天”，渡过了永不会忘记的八月十八号，胜利的完成了一天一夜的进军。民工们崇高的革命意志，伟大的阶级友爱精神，战胜了一切困难，犹如他的名字“钢铁”一样坚强。
