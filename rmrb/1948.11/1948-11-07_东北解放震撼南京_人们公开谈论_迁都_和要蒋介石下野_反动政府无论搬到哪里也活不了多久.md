Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. The great victory of the People's Liberation Army in completely liberating Northeast China is shaking Chiang Kai-shek's small court in Nanjing. An Associated Press reporter reported: The Kuomintang's "serious defeat in Manchuria has made Nanjing suddenly tense, and people are already openly talking about the possibility of the government moving" (Nanjing, October 29th). A Reuters reporter speculated that the Kuomintang reactionaries might run to "escape havens like Guangdong to establish a government in exile" (Nanjing, 1st). The reporter also said: "The Kuomintang's military setbacks in Manchuria have now brought the Chiang Kai-shek government closer to the brink of collapse than at any time during its existence in the past twenty years."

Chiang Kai-shek, who personally lost three American-equipped corps in Northeast China, fled back to Nanjing in a panic from Beiping on the 30th of last month. That afternoon, he "summoned his senior aides, including Weng Wenhao, He Yingqin, and Zhang Qun, to his official residence for an emergency meeting. The meeting was characterized by an unprecedented gloomy atmosphere. Chiang Kai-shek abandoned his usual optimistic tone and described the current military situation as the "most serious" since the end of the war against Japan. Chiang said: "The government's (referring to the Kuomintang) position in Northeast China is 'very bad'. Whether a collapse can be avoided will be decided in the next three months. He admitted that the next three months will be the most difficult to get through. He did not express confidence in whether the government could get through the next three months. He spoke in the most gloomy and pessimistic tone" (United Press, Nanjing, October 31st). This Chiang Kai-shek, with a gloomy face, frantically extended his hand to American imperialism for help once again. When answering questions from New York Herald Tribune reporter Steel, he shamelessly shouted for his foreign father to "save" him and guaranteed that he would "adhere to international faith" and "fulfill his moral responsibilities," wholeheartedly acting as a loyal lackey of American imperialism. However, American imperialism and its spokespersons are even more impolite. An Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 30th stated: "A suggestion that Chiang Kai-shek resign as president and go abroad for a year, which has been discussed secretly for a long time, has been made public." A United Press dispatch from Nanjing on the same day also reported that Liu Butong, a Kuomintang reactionary who was showing an anti-Chiang stance, had openly demanded that Chiang Kai-shek step down and "go to the United States for convalescence." Liu published an essay in "University Review" entitled "Wishing the President a Safe Journey to the United States for Convalescence." Regardless of whether American imperialism immediately abandons Chiang Kai-shek and finds Li Zongren or other second or third-rate lackeys to serve as new tools for enslaving the Chinese people, or whether it delays for some time, in any case, Chiang Kai-shek, this lackey, is becoming increasingly worthless in the eyes of the American master. Under American strategy, the shadow of an American colonial government headed by Li Zongren, He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, and Song Ziwen, which superficially removes Chiang Kai-shek, is wriggling. But what good will this do? As long as the People's Liberation Army wins a few more major victories like those in Northeast China, this gang of foxes and dogs will have no chance to survive. In recent months, the victories of the People's Liberation Army have shortened the process of the Chinese revolution.
Whether the American colonial government remains in Nanjing or moves to Guangzhou, it will not survive for long anyway.

　　东北解放震撼南京
    人们公开谈论“迁都”和要蒋介石下野
    反动政府无论搬到哪里也活不了多久
    【新华社陕北五日电】人民解放军完全解放东北的伟大胜利，震撼着南京的蒋家小朝廷。美联社记者报导：国民党“在满洲的严重败北，已使南京突呈紧张，人们已在公开谈论着政府迁移的可能性”（南京十月二十九日电）。路透社记者设想国民党反动集团可能要跑到“广东之类的逃避所成立流亡政府”（南京一日电）。该记者并说：“国民党在满洲的军事挫折，现在已使蒋介石政府比过去二十年存在期间的任何时候都更加接近崩溃的边缘。”
    在东北亲手丢掉了三个美械化兵团的蒋介石，于上月三十日自北平狼狈逃回南京后，当天下午即“将他的高级助手，包括翁文灏、何应钦、张群召集到官邸举行紧急会议。会议以前所未见的阴郁气氛为特点。蒋介石放弃了平常的乐观腔调，描述目前的军事情势为对日战争结束以来之“最严重者”。蒋说：“政府（指国民党）在东北的地位‘很糟’。崩溃是否能够避免将在今后三个月中决定。他承认今后三个月最难渡过。他没有对政府能否渡过今后三个月表示具有信心。他以最阴郁和最悲观的腔调讲话”（合众社南京十月三十一日电）。这个满脸晦气的蒋介石，慌乱中向美帝国主义又一次伸出乞援之手。他在答复美国纽约先驱论坛报记者史迪禄的询问时竟毫不羞耻地叫喊他的洋爸爸“拯救”他，并保证自己“恪守国际信义”、“克尽其道义责任”，死心塌地地充当美帝国主义的忠实走狗。但是，美帝国主义及其代言人是更加不客气了。美联社南京三十日电称：“一项长时间暗中谈论的蒋介石不辞去总统之职而出国一年的建议已经公开化”。合众社同日南京亦报导，看着反蒋姿态的国民党反动分子伪立刘不同已公开要求蒋介石下野“赴美休养”，刘于“大学评论”上发表论文，题目是“祝总统赴美休养一路平安”。不管美帝国主义是否立即丢开蒋介石，找李宗仁之类第二第三名走狗来作为它奴役中国人民的新工具，或者还要迁延一些时日，无论如何，蒋介石这只走狗，在美国主子眼中是越来越不值钱了。在美国策略下，一个李宗仁、何应钦、白崇禧、宋子文为首的表面上去掉蒋介石的美国殖民政府的阴影在蠕动着。但是这能顶什么事呢？只消人民解放军再有几个东北那样的大胜仗，这批狐群狗党就没有活命了。不论美国殖民政府留在南京也好，搬到广州去也好，总之活不了多少时候。最近几个月人民解放军的胜利，缩短了中国革命的过程。
