　　[North Yue Electric Dispatch] The bandit troops of Fu Zuoyi, attempting to sneak attack Shijiazhuang, began their southward advance on the 28th and were met with a head-on blow from our main forces. On the 30th, the 262nd Division (formerly the Provisional 17th Division) and the 101st Division of Fu's 35th Army reinforced Baoding. Subsequently, the 267th Division (formerly the Provisional 26th Division) and a transport battalion garrisoned the North Gate of XuShui. On the evening of the 31st, a certain unit of our army, in coordination with the main forces, launched a fierce attack on the enemy. After a brief but intense battle lasting about an hour, over 200 enemy soldiers, including a battalion commander, were killed or wounded, and 29 enemy soldiers were captured. The spoils of war included one light machine gun, four rifles, one grenade launcher, one spare machine gun barrel, thousands of rounds of ammunition, 31 mules and horses, and seven camels. Furthermore: Another unit of our army, on the same evening, launched a swift and forceful attack on the Beihe train station. Unable to withstand the assault, the bandits fled in disarray. We captured four enemy soldiers, seizing two rifles, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, four carts, and a large quantity of salt.

　　[Central Hebei Electric Dispatch] Correspondent Tian Xin reports that during this blocking action against the invading bandit troops of Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army displayed extremely high morale. Before the battle, upon hearing of Fu Zuoyi's plot to sneak attack Shijiazhuang, all the officers and soldiers were greatly angered and rushed to the battle area under the starry night. To resolutely defend Shijiazhuang and the sacred construction of the liberated area, they posted "even if we don't eat for three days, we will still go to the front line" and "wherever you point, we will strike; wherever the enemy flees, we will pursue them" slogans on their weapons as battle vows. After entering the battlefield, to prepare a large grave for the bandit troops of Chiang and Fu, everyone, from the military and political leaders down to the logistical staff, worked tirelessly to construct fortifications, completing the "Hundred-Li Defense Line" along the Tang River in a very short time. During the construction of fortifications, the entire army put forward the slogan "dig even when tired, dig even when sleepy, and dig even when the enemy knocks it down!" Shi Qihe, a military-political research committee member of the 7th Company, and Wang Kecheng, a member of a certain unit, braved the icy river water, using ropes to measure distances back and forth to accurately construct the firepower network. The deputy instructor of the 2nd Company and Wang Wenshuan, the company commander of the 2nd Company, took the lead in pulling carts to transport wood. Soldiers Zhang Tong and Ma Fuzhi of a certain company took off their shirts to dig fortifications. The 2nd Platoon of the 8th Company of a certain unit, in order to build a large bunker, even forgot to eat. Some, while digging fortifications, discussed how to fight cavalry and aircraft. At the discussion meeting, some soldiers said unhappily: "Why doesn't the higher-up let us fight on the front?" In the battle on October 29th, when crushing the reorganized 12th Brigade of Fu Zuoyi's bandit cavalry, after continuous combat, marching, and building fortifications, a certain unit attacked the enemy for thirty li that day, without sleep for two nights and one day, and having eaten only one meal. However, during the pursuit, not a single person, including the sick, fell behind. In order to strike the enemy, a certain unit traveled more than a hundred li in a single day. When reporters asked the soldiers: "Why are you able to fight so tirelessly and tenaciously?" The brave warriors proudly replied: "How can we allow the pig snouts of the Chiang and Fu bandits to defile our bright and happy liberated area?"

    【北岳电】妄图偷袭石家庄之傅匪，二十八日开始南犯，遭我主力迎头痛击。三十日匪卅五军二六二师（即原暂十七师）、一零一师增援保定，其后尾二六七师（即原暂廿六师）及输送营进驻徐水北关。三十一日晚，我军某部为配合主力作战，猛烈袭击该敌，激战一时许，计毙伤敌营长以下二百余名，俘敌二十九名。缴获轻机枪一挺、步枪四支、掷弹筒备复机枪身各一、子弹数千发、骡马三十一匹、骆驼七匹。又讯：我军另部，于当日晚以火速动作强袭北河车站，匪不支逃窜，我俘敌四，缴获步枪两支、子弹数百发、大车四辆、食盐大部。
    【冀中电】分社记者田心报导，人民解放军某部此次阻击蒋傅匪军进犯中，全军士气极为旺盛，战斗前，该部听说傅匪阴谋偷袭石家庄，全体指战员大为愤怒，便星夜赶至作战地区。他们为坚决保卫石家庄，保卫解放区的神圣建设，把“三天不吃饭，也要上火线”“指到哪里打到哪里，敌人逃到那里就追到他那里”的枪杆诗、顺口流，贴在自己的武器上，作为战斗的誓言。进入战地后，为给蒋傅匪军安排下大的坟墓，上至军政首长，下至勤杂人员，都不顾劳累的做工事，在很短时间里，完成了唐河沿岸的“百里防线”。构筑工事中，全军提出“累也挖、困也挖，敌人打塌还要挖！”某部七连士委会军政研究委员史岐河，某部王克成，为精确构置火力网，趟着冰冷的河水，用绳子来回测量距离。二连副指导员及二连连长王文拴，带头拉车运木料。某连战士张统、马福至，脱了光膀子挖工事。某部八连二班，为修筑一个大堡垒，连饭都顾不得吃。有的一面挖工事，一面讨论怎样打骑兵、打飞机。在讨论会上，有的战士不高兴的说：“上级为什么不让我们打正面？”在十月二十九日，击溃傅匪骑兵整编十二旅的战斗中，某部经过连续作战、行军、筑工事以后，当天又攻敌人三十里，两夜一天没睡觉，而且只吃了一顿饭。但在追击中，连病号在内，没有一个掉队的，某部为打击敌人，一天往返百余里。当记者问战士：“你们为什么能够这样不顾劳累，顽强作战？”勇士们骄傲的答道：“我们这样光明幸福的解放区，怎能让蒋傅匪的猪嘴去沾污她呢？”
