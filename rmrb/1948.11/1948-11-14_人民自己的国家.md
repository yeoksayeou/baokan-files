Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. Hu Yuzhi, Chairman of the Malayan Branch of the China Democratic League and Director of the Nanyang Siang Pau in Singapore, visited the Liberated Areas and wrote a special article for the Nanyang Siang Pau, reporting his impressions of the Liberated Areas, which was broadcast by this agency. The title is "The People's Own Country." The text is as follows:

　　I have arrived in the Liberated Area. No, I have arrived in our people's own country.

　　Dear overseas friends! I report this news to you from the distant north, and my heart is filled with joy and surprise. I remember four years ago, when I was taking refuge in the highlands of Sumatra, I wrote a novel in my boredom, fictionalizing the story of an overseas Chinese boy dreaming of a New China. Now I am not in the New China of my dreams, but in the real New China. What surprises me is that this real New China is much greater, more beautiful, and more lovable than the New China I imagined. This is our people's own country, created by our people, and owned by our people themselves.

　　The areas that have been liberated so far are only a part of our great motherland, about one-third. The population is about 170 million, which is more than the population of the United States. If we were to merge Malaya, Indonesia, Burma, Siam, Vietnam, and the Philippines in Southeast Asia into one country, it would be similar to the Liberated Areas today. Especially after the great victory of this autumn offensive, the five major Liberated Areas of North China, Northwest China, Northeast China, East China, and Central Plains, which were previously scattered and isolated from each other, have been completely connected into a whole, which includes all the rural areas, as well as many large cities such as Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Anshan, Jilin, Jiamusi, Jinzhou, Jinan, Weifang, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Shijiazhuang, and Baotou, some seaports such as Yantai, Yingkou, and Weihaiwei, and more than 500 small and medium-sized cities. Isn't this enough to become a truly great country?

　　This new country is expanding and developing every day. In these few days, the news of the great victory of the People's Liberation Army has shocked the world. It seems that the remaining less than two-thirds of the motherland's land and people will soon be completely liberated. Although the New China News Agency editorial in July of this year estimated that it would take three to four years for a nationwide victory, I disagree with this view. Because, just like the financial expenditure of the Chiang Kai-shek government, the actual amount always exceeds the budget by several times. It was originally estimated that it would take at least two months to capture Jinan, but it was taken down in only eight days. In the third year of combat, the People's Liberation Army only planned to eliminate 120,000 to 130,000 enemy troops each month, but in less than two months since the start of the autumn offensive (September 12), more than 600,000 Chiang's troops were annihilated on all fronts, including those who revolted, defected, and surrendered, which is equivalent to one-sixth of the total strength of Chiang's troops at the beginning of the autumn offensive, more than twice the original estimate.

　　After only two years of fighting, the People's Liberation Army has possessed unparalleled and powerful siege capabilities, so that it can seize any large city with strong defenses at will. This incident made American journalists marvel at "the Chinese Communist Party's superhuman power." In fact, the Communist Party is just ordinary people, not supermen. What is truly surprising is the strength of the Chinese people. The Communist Party has superhuman power because the Communist Party is the party of the people. The reason why the People's Liberation Army can defeat the Chiang Kai-shek army supported by the United States is because the People's Liberation Army is the army of the people. But this is something that American journalists cannot understand and are unwilling to understand.

　　The Chinese people can not only defeat Chiang Kai-shek's army, but also defeat enemies more powerful than Chiang Kai-shek. In fact, in addition to defeating Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese people have defeated many other enemies.

　　Let me cite some facts I have seen and heard here to illustrate this.

　　For thousands of years, corrupt officials, bureaucrats, local tyrants, and bullies have occupied China's cities and villages, sucking the people's sweat and blood, and scraping the people's fat. This kind of feudal evil force has always been the most terrible enemy of the people, but here, even if it has not been completely eliminated, it has at least disappeared. Since the implementation of rent reduction and interest reduction and land reform in the rural areas of the Liberated Areas, a new democratic order has been established everywhere. The common people have become masters, upright people have been elected to do things, and bad elements can no longer show their faces. There are no officials here, only administrative cadres and Communist Party members who help the common people do things. Their living standards are the same as the common people, or even worse, but they shoulder heavy responsibilities and arduous work. The same is true in the cities of the Liberated Areas. An employee of the county government told me that recently some people in the county government advocated abolishing the judicial section because there had been no official business to handle for a long time. In many old Liberated Areas, people not only don't worry about hunger, cold, thieves, or being afraid of being drafted or paying taxes, but even lawsuits are almost gone. What does this show? It shows that the people have defeated the feudal evil forces and established a new democratic society.

　　The most profound impression of entering the Liberated Area for the first time is that there is no sense of lack of materials here, but few foreign goods are seen. The people rely on their own labor and production to solve the supply of clothing, food, housing, transportation, and all daily necessities. Spinning and weaving has become a common sideline in rural areas. I saw that in administrative organs and the army, cadres have a hand-cranked spinning machine and engage in labor production in their spare time. In the large and small cities that have been liberated one after another, factories and mines have quickly resumed operations and improved production efficiency. The foundation of light and heavy industry has been established. The military industry has developed especially rapidly. I visited a pharmaceutical factory and learned that the Liberated Area no longer needs to import medicines from outside. Except for a few such as penicillin, all medicines, even anatomical and medical supplies, can be manufactured by themselves. Today, the United States has become the "food and clothing parent" of the Kuomintang. But in the Liberated Area, there are not only no American soldiers, but also no American goods. What there are are only American-made guns and jeeps, which were sent by Chiang Kai-shek's army and are used exclusively to attack the US-Chiang clique. Imperialism has always carried out commodity aggression against semi-colonial China. Now the people of the Liberated Area have indeed defeated this economic aggression of imperialism and established an independent and self-reliant national economy.

　　In the rural areas of the Liberated Area, you can't see haggard faces of the common people, and in the cities, you can't see beggars and refugees wandering the streets. Naturally, the luxurious life enjoyed by the few rich people we see in Shanghai and Hong Kong is unimaginable here. But in the Liberated Area, everyone has land and work and is no longer threatened by hunger and unemployment. Not only has freedom from hunger been universally achieved, but the common people are working hard to increase production and open up wasteland, and strive to achieve adequate food and clothing and get rich, which is something that the masses of the people in the Kuomintang area cannot dream of. This also shows that the people have also defeated another stubborn enemy—poverty and hunger. The people's right to survival is guaranteed.

　　Therefore, the strongest impression I got after arriving in the Liberated Area is not something else, but the strength of the Chinese people. The Chinese people have not only defeated Chiang Kai-shek's army, but also defeated feudal evil forces, defeated imperialist economic aggression, and defeated poverty and hunger, the most vicious enemy. The people can not only defeat their enemies, but also build a new China that is independent, free, prosperous, and strong. This is our country, the Chinese people's own country. This is what I have seen with my own eyes.

　　In contrast to this people's country is another "country," that is, the "country" of the four big families, which is obviously about to collapse, is corrupt to the bone, and is colonialized.

　　Friends, if there are still some people overseas who do not believe in the strength of the Chinese people and do not recognize the Chinese people's own country, then don't worry, in the near future, they will believe it. As for those few inflexible guys, let them hold on to the rotten legs of the four big families. Soon they will fall into the mud. The people will soon achieve final victory. The people's New China will shine with boundless light and stand forever on the Asian continent.

　　人民自己的国家
    胡愈之
    【新华社陕北九日电】中国民主同盟马来亚支部主任委员，新嘉坡南侨日报社长胡愈之，来解放区观光，顷为南侨日报撰写专文，报导来解放区之观感，交由本社广播。题为“人民自己的国家”。文如下：
    我到了解放区了。不，我到了我们人民自己的国家里了。
    可敬爱的海外朋友们！我从遥远的北方，报告你们这一消息，我的心头是充满着愉快和惊奇的。记得四年前在苏门答腊高原上避难时，我在百无聊赖中，曾经写过一本小说，虚构一个华侨少年梦游新中国的故事。现在我不是在梦中的新中国，而是到了真真实实的新中国了。使我惊奇的是这个真实的新中国，要比我所假想的新中国，更伟大，更美丽，更可爱的多。这才是我们人民自己的国家，是我们人民创造的，是我们人民自己所有的。
    到目前为止已经解放的地区，还不过是我们的伟大的祖国的一部分，大约是三分之一部分。其中的人口大约有一亿七千万，比美国的人口还要多。假如把南洋的马来亚，印度尼西亚，缅甸，暹罗，越南，菲律宾，合并成一个国家，那才和今天的解放区相仿佛。特别是经过这次秋季攻势的伟大胜利，向来分散的，互相隔离的华北，西北，东北，华东，中原五大解放区已经完全连接成一个整体，其中包含有全部农村，又有沈阳，哈尔滨，长春，安东，吉林，佳木斯，锦州，济南，潍坊，开封，郑州，洛阳，石门，包头这许多大城市，烟台，营口，威海卫这一些海口，以及五百多个中小城市。这还不够成为一个真正的大国家吗？
    这个新国家每天都在扩大着，发展着。在这几天，解放军伟大胜利的消息，震惊了全世界。看来剩下不到三分之二的祖国土地和人民，不久就要得到完全解放了。虽然本年七月间新华社社论估计全国胜利，还要三四年的时间。但我不同意这一看法。因为正和蒋介石政府的财政支出一样，实际总是比预算超过了好几倍。济南本来估计最少要两月才能攻下，后来只有八天就打下来了。解放军在第三年作战中，只打算每个月消灭敌军十二三万，但从秋季攻势开始（九月十二日）以后不到两个月中，各线蒋军被歼灭的，连同起义反正与投降的在内，就有六十几万，相等于秋季攻势开始时蒋军总兵力的六分之一，比原来的估计超过了两倍。
    人民解放军经过了仅仅两年多的战斗，已经具备了无比强大的攻坚力量，以至于可以随心所欲夺取任何一座有坚强设防的大城市。这一件事使美国新闻记者不得不惊叹着“中国共产党具有超人的力量”。其实共产党只是平常的人，并不是超人。而真正值得惊奇的，则是中国人民力量的强大。共产党有超人力量，是因为共产党是人民的党。解放军所以能够打败美国所支援的蒋介石军队，是因为解放军是人民的军队。但这是美国新闻记者所不能了解而亦不愿了解的。
    中国人民不但能够打败蒋介石军队，而且也能够打败比蒋介石更强大的敌人。事实上中国人民除了打败蒋介石以外，已经打败其他许多的敌人了。
    让我举出这里所看到听到的一些事实来说明罢。
    贪官污吏豪绅恶霸，几千年来就盘据中国的城市和农村，吮吸着人民的汗血，刮削着人民的脂膏。这种封建恶势力，一向是最可怕的人民敌人，但在这里，即使还没有完全消灭，至少是已经销声匿迹了。解放区的农村自从分别实施减租减息和土地改革以后，新的民主秩序，到处建立起来。老百姓做了主人，正派人士被推举出来做事，坏东西再不能出头露面。这里没有官吏，只有帮助老百姓做事的行政干部和共产党员。他们的生活享受，和老百姓一样，甚至还不如，但他们却担负了重大的责任和艰苦的工作。在解放区的城市里也是同样情形。有一位县政府的工作人员告诉我，最近县政府里有人主张把司法科裁撤，为的是许久以来没有公事可办。在许多老解放区里，人民不但不担心饥寒盗贼，不害怕抓丁征粮，连诉讼案件几乎都没有了。这说明了什么？说明了人民已经打败了封建恶势力，建立起民主新社会。
    第一次进入解放区，印象最深的一件事，是这里绝不感到物资缺乏，却很少看到外国货物。人民依靠自己的劳动生产，解决了衣食住行以及一切日用品的供给问题。纺纱织布成为农村中普遍的副业。我见到行政机关和军队里，干部人员都有一架手摇纺纱机，在公余的时间，从事劳动生产。在陆续解放的大小城市中，工厂和矿厂很快地复业，而且提高了生产效率。轻重工业的基础已建立起来。军需业发展得尤其迅速。我参观了一家制药厂，才知道解放区已经不大需要从外面输入药品。只除了盘尼西林等几种以外，一切药品，甚至解剖医疗用品，都可以自己制造了。在今天，美国变成国民党的“衣食父母”。但在解放区内，不但没有美国兵，而且也没有美国货品。有的只不过是美国制造的枪炮和吉普车，而这是蒋介石军队亲自送来，而又专用以打击美蒋集团的。帝国主义对半殖民地的中国，一向是进行商品侵略的。现在解放区的人民确实已经打败了这种帝国主义的侵略，而建立了自给自足的独立自主的民族经济了。
    在解放区的农村里，看不到面色憔悴的老百姓，在城市里也看不到踯躅街头的乞丐和难民。自然，象我们在上海香港所见到的少数富人所享受的豪华生活，在这里是想象不到的。可是在解放区里，却人人都有土地和工作，不再受到饥饿和失业的威胁。不但普遍地做到了免于饥饿，而且老百姓都在努力增产辟荒，努力做到丰衣足食，发家致富，这是国民党地区内人民大众所不能梦想的。这又说明人民也打败了另一个顽强的敌人——贫穷与饥饿。人民的生存权利是得到保障了。
    因此我到解放区以后所得到的最强烈的印象，不是别的，而是中国人民力量的强大。中国人民不但打败了蒋介石军队，而且也打败了封建恶势力，打败了帝国主义的经济侵略，打败了贫穷与饥饿这个最最凶恶的敌人。人民不但能够打败他们的敌人，而且他们能够建造一个独立自由富强的新中国，这就是我们的国家，是中国人民自已的国家。这是我所亲眼见到的。
    和这个人民的国家相对照的则是另一个“国家”，那就是眼见得快要垮台的，贪污腐化入骨的，殖民地化的，四大家族的“国家”。
    朋友们，假如在海外还有一些人不相信中国人民的力量，不承认中国人民自己的国家，那么，且不用焦急，在不久的将来，他们就会相信的。至于那些少数不灵的家伙，那就让他们死捧着四大家族这个滥腿罢，不久他们就掉到泥潭里去了。人民很快就要得到最后胜利。人民的新中国将显出万丈光芒，永远矗立在亚洲大陆之上。
