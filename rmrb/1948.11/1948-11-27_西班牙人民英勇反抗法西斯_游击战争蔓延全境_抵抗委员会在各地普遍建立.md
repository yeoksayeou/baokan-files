Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Moscow dispatch: "The flames of guerrilla warfare are spreading throughout Spain," this is the Pravda's report on the recent situation in Spain. A special article in Pravda stated: Neither hunger, poverty, nor bloody terror has broken the Spanish people's will to resist and struggle. Strikes and slowdowns have been frequent recently. In just four months, the underground National Democratic Forces Alliance has launched 250 strikes, with more than 340,000 workers participating. Particularly troublesome for the Franco group is the strike movement in the provinces of Catalonia (northeastern coast of Spain), an industrial area, where the strikes are often political. The flames of guerrilla warfare are spreading throughout Spain. Many workers and peasants have gone to the mountains to join the guerrillas. Scattered resistance forces have merged to form powerful guerrilla units. The Fourth Guerrilla unit, which fought 308 times last year, is now active in Galicia in the northwest. The guerrillas controlling Asturias (Atlantic coast, east of Galicia), known for its glorious revolutionary traditions, are also growing in strength. Recently, the guerrillas launched military operations in Oviedo, the center of Asturias, and other industrial cities. In Andalusia in the south, the guerrillas fought 348 times last year. The strongest and best-organized guerrilla force, the Levant-Aragon guerrillas (west of Catalonia), is active in eastern Spain. After four years of arduous fighting, regular guerrilla units have been established there, which the Fascist Party members fear.

In May, the Levant-Aragon guerrillas issued an appeal to all guerrilla forces in Spain, calling for the establishment of a central committee of the resistance movement and planning a program of common struggle. At the same time, they expressed their hope to establish a brand-new republican government, representing the resistance forces, and closely connected with them. Resistance committees have been established throughout Spain, and committees and groups to assist the guerrillas have been established among overseas compatriots. Thousands of Spanish women help the guerrillas to cover and organize protest demonstrations.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Reuter, London, 18th: The British Communist Party has issued a statement strongly protesting against the Franco government's continued execution of Spanish democrats, and calling on British progressives to protest against this terror. The statement pointed out that in the past week, thirteen more democrats have been sentenced to death. In a statement, the British Communist Party demanded that Britain sever all diplomatic, financial, and economic relations with Franco's Spain. At the same time, the International Brigade Association also issued a statement condemning the British Foreign Office for using legal arguments as an excuse to refuse to intervene and save the lives of Spanish democrats, and stated that the Foreign Office's attitude is equivalent to condoning Franco's massacre.

Also reported: The Spanish Republic Radio Bireneica announced on the 9th that Jose Gomez, the secretary of the Galician Communist Party, and Antonio Escors, the leader of the Galician guerrillas, who were sentenced to death by the Fascist Franco Corunna (northwestern corner of the western border) military court in early autumn this year, have been killed. Radio Bireneica announced: "The people of Galicia will not cry for their dead heroes, but will fight according to their example and avenge them." Radio Bireneica also called on the Galician guerrillas to carry out a more resolute struggle against Franco.

　　西班牙人民英勇反抗法西斯
  　游击战争蔓延全境
    抵抗委员会在各地普遍建立
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】莫斯科讯：“游击战争的火焰正蔓延西班牙全境”，这是真理报对最近西班牙局势的报导。真理报专文称：不论饥饿、贫穷或血腥恐怖，都不曾破裂西班牙人民抵抗和斗争的意志。罢工和怠工日前频繁，仅在四个月中，地下的全国民主力量联盟就发动了二百五十次罢工，参加工人在三十四万以上。特别使佛朗哥集团感到棘手的，是工业区加泰隆尼亚（西班牙东北部海岸）各省的罢工运动，那里的罢工常常是政治性的。游击战争的火焰正蔓延于西班牙全境。许多工人和农民到山区参加了游击队。分散的抵抗队伍汇合起来形成了有力的游击部队。去年曾作战三百零八次的第四游击队，现在活跃于西北部的加里西亚。控制着以光荣革命传统闻名的奥斯托利亚斯（大西洋海岸，加里西亚以东）的游击队也正在壮大中。最近，游击队曾在奥斯托和亚斯的中心奥维亚多及其他一些工业城市发动军事行动。在南部的安达鲁西亚，去年一年中游击队曾作战三百四十八次。最强大、组织得最好的游击队、利凡特阿拉冈（在加泰隆尼亚之西）游击队活动于西班牙东部。四年最艰苦战斗的结果，正规的游击队部队已经在那里建立，这是法西斯党徒所害怕的。
    五月间，利凡特阿拉冈游击队曾向西班牙一切游击部队发出呼吁，号召建立抵抗运动中央委员会并策划共同斗争的纲领。同时，他们表示希望建立一个崭新的共和政府，代表抵抗力量，并和他们密切联系。抵抗委员会已经在西班牙各地建立，在国外侨民中间则成立了援助游击队的委员会和团体。成千的西班牙妇女帮助游击队掩护和组织抗议示威。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】电通社伦敦十八日讯：英共顷发表声明坚决抗议佛朗哥政府继续处决西班牙民主分子，并号召英国进步人士抗议这种恐怖。声明指出，最近一周内又有十三位民主人士被判死刑。英共在声明中要求英国断绝与佛朗哥西班牙的一切外交、财政和经济关系。同时，国际纵队协会亦发表声明，谴责英国外交部以司法论据为口实，拒绝干涉和拯救西班牙民主人士的生命，并称外交部的态度等于纵容佛朗哥的惨杀行为。
    又讯：西班牙共和国电台比利乃卡于九日宣布，在今年秋初被法西斯佛朗哥科伦那（西境西北角）军事法庭，判处死刑的加里西亚共产党书记约西点哥美次和加里西亚游击队领袖安东尼点斯科尔斯，都已被杀害。比利乃卡电台宣布：“加里西亚的人民，将不是为他们已死的英雄哭泣，而是按照他们的榜样战斗，为他们复仇。”比利乃卡电台并号召加里西亚游击队对佛朗哥进行更坚决的斗争。
