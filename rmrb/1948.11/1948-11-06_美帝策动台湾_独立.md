　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. The US-engineered Taiwan "independence" activity has become increasingly blatant. According to the Shanghai Kuomintang's Zheng Yan Bao on September 24, the so-called "Taiwan Re-Liberation Alliance" organization has openly appeared in Japan, proposing that Taiwan must be "independent," the United Nations should send troops to occupy Taiwan by the end of this year, establish a temporary government of Taiwan, and withdraw all Chinese in Taiwan, in order to facilitate the annexation of Taiwan by US imperialism. Zheng Yan Bao also stated that under the instigation of the Americans, the alliance is actively organizing various groups in Taiwan to carry out secessionist activities.

　　美帝策动台湾“独立”
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】美国一手策动的台湾“独立”活动，已愈益露骨。据九月二十四日上海国民党的正言报刊载，所谓“台湾再解放联盟”组织，已在日本公然出现，并提出台湾必须“独立”，联合国应在今年年底派遣军队占领台湾，成立台湾临时政府，撤退在台全部华人等以便于美帝国主义吞并台湾的主张。正言报并称：该联盟在美人主使下，已在台湾积极组织各种团体，进行分裂活动。
