Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Tokyo dispatch: The three major coal mine unions in Japan, which have 85 percent of Japan's 470,000 coal mine workers, called on their union workers on the 21st to hold a strike on the 23rd. These three major coal mine unions are the Japan Coal Mine Labor Union Federation, the All Japan Coal Production Affairs Union, and the Coal Mine Labor Union Unified Council. From the 13th to the 17th, 70 percent of the 470,000 coal mine workers had successively gone on strike. According to TASS reports, according to statistics from the Japan Federation of Industrial Labor Unions, one million Japanese workers are currently on strike, including 450,000 members of the Federation of Industrial Labor Unions. 5.7 million workers are participating in the movement to demand wage increases, including 104,000 workers from private railways and 150,000 textile workers. The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper, Akahata, commented that the characteristic of the current Japanese workers' movement is the establishment of unified organizations and the coordination of the struggle for wage increases. The struggle against the government's policy of lowering wages and against the government and capitalists' mass layoffs of workers is underway.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: TASS Tokyo dispatch: Soviet Commissioner Derevyanko of the Allied Council for Japan sent a letter to MacArthur on the 12th, condemning the US-Japan authorities' policy of continuing to undermine the Japanese workers' movement and student movement, and reviving Japanese fascist ideology. Derevyanko's letter stated: The Soviet representative pointed out twice in August that the US-Japan authorities' measures against labor violated the Potsdam Declaration and the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission. "However, the situation in this regard has not changed so far." "The suppression of factory workers and office staff in Japan is continuing on a large scale. Mass arrests are being carried out not only among striking workers and staff in state-owned enterprises, but also among workers in all other industrial sectors. On the other hand, there are illegal attempts to ban the political activities of Japanese student groups, and students are being expelled in groups. Japanese newspapers, especially right-wing and reactionary newspapers, are increasingly openly and directly advocating the revival of the military and police rule before Japan's surrender, and are clamoring for the elimination of Japanese democratic forces. Various extreme nationalists and fascists are beginning to resume and develop their activities, shamelessly clamoring for the establishment of fascism in Japan." Derevyanko cited the propaganda activities of a number of extremely reactionary groups, especially the reactionary professors' group in the Kansai area (Osaka-Kobe area). The group published a booklet entitled "Appeal to the Motherland on the Brink of Disaster" which praised Mussolini's great achievements and initiated the establishment of fascism in Japan, and this booklet was widely promoted throughout Japan. Derevyanko demanded that immediate measures be taken to suppress fascist propaganda in Japan.

    【新华社陕北十九日电】东京讯：拥有全日本四十七万煤矿工人中百分之八十五的日本三大煤矿工会于二十一日号召其会员工人于二十三日举行罢工。这三大煤矿工会即日本炭坑劳动组合同盟、全日本石炭产务组合及炭矿劳动组合统一协议会。自十三日至十七日五天内，四十七万煤矿工人的百分之七十曾先后罢工。据塔斯社报导：根据日本产业劳动组合联合会的统计，正在罢工中的日本工人已达一百万，其中包括产业劳动组合联合会的会员四十五万人。有五百七十万工人正参加要求增加工资的运动，包括私营铁道的十万四千工人和纺织业的十五万工人。日共机关报赤旗报评称：目前日本工人运动的特色，乃是建立统一的组织，并使与增加工资的斗争相互配合。反对政府压低工资的政策以及反对政府与资本家方面大批解雇工人的斗争正进行中。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社东京讯：盟国对日委员会苏联委员德勒维扬科中将于十二日致函麦克阿瑟，谴责美日当局继续摧残日本工人运动与学生运动以及复活日本法西斯思想的政策。德勒维扬科函称：苏联代表于八月间曾两度指出美日当局对劳工的措施，违反波茨顿宣言及远东委员会的决定。“然而，这方面的情形至今仍未改变”，“对日本工厂工人及机关职员的镇压，正大规模地继续着。不仅在国营企业的罢工工人及职员中，而且在其他一切工业部门的工人中，正进行着大批逮捕。另一方面，正非法地企图禁止日本学生团体的政治活动，成群地开除学生。日本报纸，特别是右派的和反动的报纸，正在日益公开和直接地提倡复活日本投降前的军警统治，而且叫嚣着消灭日本民主力量。各种极端国家主义分子和法西斯主义分子，正开始恢复和发展其活动，厚颜无耻地叫嚣在日本建立法西斯主义。”德勒维扬科举出若干极端反动团体，特别是关西区（大坂——神户区）反动教授团体的宣传活动。该团体发表了盛赞墨索里尼的伟绩与发起在日本建立法西斯主义的“对灾难边缘的祖国呼吁”的小册子，这个小册子在全日本被大量推行着。德勒维扬科要求立即采取措施镇压日本的法西斯宣传。
