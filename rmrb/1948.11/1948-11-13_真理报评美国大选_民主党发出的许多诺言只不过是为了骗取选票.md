　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 11th: TASS, Moscow, November 7th: *Pravda* published a special article commenting on the results of the U.S. election, stating: The defeat of the Republican Party is nothing sensational. The fact that newspapers supporting Dewey persistently emphasized his close ties with Wall Street certainly did not promote but rather weakened the Republican Party's chances of being elected. During this period, the Democratic Party and Truman pretended to be opponents of Wall Street in their election campaigns.

　　The major labor union organizations, namely the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), opposed Dewey and supported Truman as a presidential candidate. This was primarily because the Republican-majority Congress, at the suggestion of the Republican Party, passed the cruel Taft-Hartley Act dictated by the National Association of Manufacturers. It is worth noting that the Taft-Hartley Act is truly a product of the "bipartisan group," for which both the Democratic and Republican parties are responsible. Truman promised to repeal the Taft-Hartley Act in his campaign speeches. It is clear that the Democratic Party headquarters' reversal of the previous stance of most Democrats in Congress was merely a consideration of campaign strategy. The President had vetoed the Taft-Hartley Act, and this veto became a significant factor in this election campaign and in reaching an agreement with the AFL-CIO.

　　The Republican Party's attitude towards price controls also played a considerable role in Dewey's defeat. The shameless movement launched by Republican leaders demanding further inflation and higher prices could only drive voters away from Dewey and his followers. The ominous shadow of Hoover from 1929 loomed large behind Dewey. The Democratic Party leaders therefore drew certain tactical conclusions. Initially, they had styled themselves as the creators of the bipartisan group, but now, they equally enthusiastically emphasized the weaknesses and conditional nature of bipartisan unity. Some time ago, they praised Vandenberg and Dulles' proposals on world issues, but now, they abruptly turned to the legacy of Roosevelt, declaring that from now on the Democratic government would take adhering to Roosevelt's policies as its sacred duty. The Democratic Party leaders made endless promises during the campaign. They were truly making a "reform" on the halfway, shamelessly appropriating the slogans put forward by Wallace's Progressive Party as their own "goods." The Democratic Party leaders accurately estimated that the program of international cooperation advocated by Wallace had gained a response and sympathy in the United States, and at the most intense moment of the campaign, precisely during the so-called "Berlin Crisis," they came out with a great deal of blunt language about the need to consolidate peace and ease international tensions. Not only that, but the Democratic Party leaders even suggested sending U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Vinson to Moscow to negotiate with the Soviet government to resolve disputes. And Dewey himself further facilitated the Democratic Party's strategy because he too shamelessly revealed Wall Street's plans. A considerable number of voters neither particularly favored Truman nor particularly opposed Dewey. In this regard, the results of the election reflected the desire of American voters to fight back against Dewey, Vandenberg, and Dulles, this blatant reactionary and aggressive faction.

　　The election results show that although the Progressive Party received only over one million votes, its role in the electoral struggle should not be underestimated. The number of votes obtained by the Progressive Party cannot be regarded as a decisive measure of estimating the party's true influence and strength. A considerable number of people who Progressive Party appealed to are deprived of the possibility of participating in elections due to numerous restrictions, and in several states, Wallace and Taylor were excluded from the candidate registration lists. Finally, everyone knows that the Progressive Party called on voters in many places to elect Democratic candidates. A large number of voters seeking to defeat the Republican Party did not elect the Progressive Party, but voted for the Democratic Party. In addition, the Progressive Party has not yet passed the initial stage of its formation. The establishment of a new party—one that opposes traditional old parties—encounters thousands of obstacles and difficulties in the United States, and these obstacles and difficulties are even greater under the recent campaign circumstances. The Progressive Party does not even have adequately organized institutions and newspapers. As far as determining the importance of the Progressive Party is concerned, the party's participation in the campaign is no less important than the party's becoming a major factor in American public life and the party's having confidence in the future.

　　The results of the election show that despite the all-out offensive launched by the reactionaries, the aggressive plans of monopoly capital have not been supported by a significant segment of the American people. The Democratic Party leaders appropriately assessed this situation during the election campaign, promising to avoid war, support lasting peace, and continue Roosevelt's domestic and foreign policies. The Democratic Party has undertaken definite obligations. From now on, they can no longer use the excuse of Congress's non-cooperation to defend themselves, because the Democratic Party holds a majority in both the Senate and the House. We will soon see whether the Democratic Party leaders intend to keep their promises.

### 真理报评美国大选  民主党发出的许多诺言只不过是为了骗取选票

　　真理报评美国大选
    民主党发出的许多诺言只不过是为了骗取选票
    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：真理报发表论美国大选结果的专文称：共和党的失败，并没有什么耸人听闻的地方。支持杜威的报纸，坚执地强调他与华尔街的亲密联系，这一事实绝没有促进反而削弱了共和党当选的机会。而这期间，民主党和杜鲁门却在其竞选运动中装作华尔街的反对者。
    主要工会组织，即美国劳联和产联反对杜威而支持杜鲁门为总统候选人。这首先是由于共和党居多数的国会在共和党的提议下通过了全国制造家协会所授意的残酷的塔夫脱——哈特莱法。值得提醒的是：塔夫脱——哈特莱法乃是名符其实的“两党集团”的产物，民主共和两党都要负责。杜鲁门在其竞选演说中答应废除塔夫脱——哈特莱法。民主党总部之所以取消国会中大多数民主党人以前的立场，很明显地只是出于竞选策略上的考虑。总统会经否决过塔夫脱——哈特莱法，而这一否决在此次竞选运动中和在与美国劳联产联取得协议方面，成为重大因素之一。
    共和党对于物价管制的态度，对于杜威的失败也有不小的作用。共和党领袖们所发动的不顾羞耻的要求进一步通货膨胀和提高物价的运动，只能使选民离开杜威及其附和者。在杜威背后庞然出现了一九二九年胡佛的阴影。民主党的领袖们便由此得出了某些策略手段上的结论。在当初，他们曾自命为两党集团的制作者，而现在，他们却同样热烈地强调两党团结的弱点和有条件性。前些时，他们在世界问题上赞美范登堡、杜勒斯的主张，而现在，他们却突如其来地转向罗斯福的余荫，宣布从今而后民主党政府将以遵行罗斯福政策为其神圣的职责。民主党的领袖们在竞选中无休止地发出诺言。他们真正是在行进的半途中来了一个“改革”，他们毫不客气地就把华莱士进步党所提出的口号拿来当做自己的“货色”。民主党领袖们恰当地估计了华莱士所拥护的国际合作纲领在美国获得了响应和同情，他们在竞选最紧张的时刻，也正是在所谓“柏林危机”的时候，出来说了一大堆需要巩固和平与缓和国际上紧张气氛的生硬言辞。不仅如此，民主党领袖们甚至还建议派美国最高法院院长文森到莫斯科与苏联政府作解决纠纷的谈判。而杜威自己又更加便利了民主党的策略，因为他太无耻地泄露了华尔街的计划。那种既不特别赞成杜鲁门也不特别反对杜威的选民，是为数不少的。在这一点上，大选的结果反映了美国选民反击杜威、范登堡和杜勒斯这个明目张胆的反动侵略派系的愿望。
    大选的结果显示出进步党虽然只得到一百余万票，但它在选举斗争中的作用是不能小看的。进步党所得选票的数量，并不能当作估计该党真正的影响和势力的有决定意义的尺度。进步党所号召的人民中，占相当数量的阶层，由于许许多多的限制，被剥夺了参加选举的可能性，而且在若干州里，华莱士和泰勒一道被排斥于候选人登记名单之外。最后，大家知道，进步党在许多地方号召选民选举民主党候选人，大量力图击败共和党的选民没有选举进步党，而把票投给了民主党。此外，进步党也还没有渡过它组成的初期阶段，新党的建立——它是反对传统的旧政党的——在美国遇到数千种障碍和困难，而在最近的竞选情形下，这些障碍和困难是更加增多了。进步党甚至还没有适当地组织起来的机构和报纸。就决定进步党的重要性而言，该党之参加竞选，并不比该党之成为美国公众生活中重大的因素与该党之具有向前的信心尤为重要。
    大选的结果显示：尽管反动派发动了全力的攻势，独占资本的侵略计划，并没有得到美国相当大的一些阶层的支持，民主党领袖们在竞选运动中正是适当地估计了这种情形，许下了避免战争、支持持久和平与继续罗斯福的内政外交政策的诺言。民主党已经使自己承担了确定的义务，从现在起，他们不能再用国会不合作这种话来为自己辩解了，因为民主党在参院和众院都占多数，我们不久就可以看到民主党领袖们是否打算信守他们的诺言。
