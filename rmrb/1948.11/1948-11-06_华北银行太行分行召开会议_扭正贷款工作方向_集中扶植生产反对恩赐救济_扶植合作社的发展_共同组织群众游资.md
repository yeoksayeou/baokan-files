　　【Taihang Telegram】The Taihang Branch of the North China Bank convened an enlarged meeting of managers of various regional offices on September 21st to correct the direction of loan work, clarify the purpose of in-kind loans, and the relationship between cooperatives and loans, and formulate a work plan for the winter of 1948. The meeting conveyed the spirit of the North China Financial and Trade Conference and conducted detailed discussions, especially on rural lending work. The discussion was permeated with the struggle on two fronts in loan work. Everyone agreed with the policy of "loans for every inch of improvement in industrial and agricultural production" and criticized the relief views of some cadres. For example, some cadres advocated universal care or emphasized lending more to disaster-stricken and poor areas, viewing loans as a means of averaging social wealth. The meeting also reviewed the past interest rate policy: formally a low-interest policy, but actually a loss-making subsidy policy. It was mistakenly believed that it was reasonable to simply subsidize poor and lower-middle peasants with state property. (Simply subsidizing poor and lower-middle peasants is wrong, but it is necessary to support and organize the production of poor and lower-middle peasants with loans and unleash their productive forces. Their production difficulties should not be ignored. - Editor) Therefore, it was said verbally that the loans should be used for production, but in reality, many borrowers used them simply to solve livelihood difficulties. The loan term was also entirely determined by the masses, and when it expired, the contract was simply renewed, forming a situation where the loan did not leave the village or the household. This resulted in loans providing relief to a small number of people, causing economic losses to the state, and failing to achieve the goal of supporting the development and construction of production in the liberated areas for the broad masses. The meeting decided: in the future, low-interest loans will be implemented, but losses must never be incurred. Interest should be distributed from the profits of production, with the public only taking a small portion and the vast majority still belonging to the producers. Loans must be recovered on time, and the allocation and use of loans must be concentrated on restoring and developing production. Regarding in-kind loans, the main purpose is to encourage social lending activities, widely mobilize and organize social floating capital, and invest it in production and construction. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure the development of state capital so that it can serve production and construction in the long term and effectively (industrial and commercial loans can still use currency, but the interest rate must be increased.) Directly issuing means of production is currently lacking in experience, but three principles must be followed: (1) High quality and low price. (2) Difficult for the masses to purchase. (3) Have advocacy value and must not be carried out blindly. At the same time, it must be combined with commodity management and stable prices to avoid stockpiling of goods and loss-making loans. When the real price of goods fluctuates, creditors may suffer temporary losses, but from a comprehensive and long-term calculation, they can still break even or even make a profit. If it can be combined with commodity management, it will be even more stable. The meeting believed that cooperatives and mutual aid groups are the link between the public economy and the individual economy of the masses, and the state bank should provide good support. For some cooperatives with the correct business direction that are supported by the masses, the bank can hand over loans to them so that they can be used in a unified manner with their own funds. Cooperatives should be responsible to the bank. If it is found that their business operations violate the loan policy and cannot be transformed in a short period of time, the loan can be immediately recovered. The meeting finally discussed and formulated this year's winter work plan.

　　华北银行太行分行召开会议
  　扭正贷款工作方向
    集中扶植生产反对恩赐救济
  　扶植合作社的发展
    共同组织群众游资
    【太行电】华北银行太行分行，于九月二十一日召开各专区办事处经理扩大会议，扭正贷款工作的方向，明确实物借贷的目的，以及合作社与贷款的关系，并制定了一九四八年冬季工作计划。会上传达了华北金融贸易会议精神，并进行了详细讨论。对农村借贷工作讨论尤详。讨论中贯串着贷款工作上两条战线的斗争，大家都同意“贷款为了工农业生产提高一寸”的方针，并批判了部分干部的救济观点。如有的干部主张普遍照顾，或强调灾区穷区多贷，把贷款看成平均社会财富的手段等。会议并检讨了过去的利息政策：形式上是低利政策，实际上是赔钱津贴政策。错误地认为拿国家财产单纯补助贫雇农是合理的。（单纯的补助贫雇农是不对的，但必须以贷款扶植与组织贫雇农生产，发挥其生产力。不能对其生产困难听之任之。——编者）所以口头上说要用于生产，实际上很多贷户用于单纯解决生活困难。贷款期限也完全由群众决定，到期换换约完事，形成款不离村，款不离户。这使贷款救济了少数人，国家经济赔累，不能达到扶助广大群众发展与建设解放区生产的目的。会议决定：今后实行低利贷款，绝不能赔本。利息从生产得利中分出，公家只要少部分，绝大部分仍归生产者。贷款一定要按期收回，分配使用贷款要集中于恢复和发展生产。关于实物借贷，主要是鼓励社会借贷活动，广泛发动与组织社会游资，投与生产建设事业。同时要保证发展国家资本，以便长期有力的服务于生产建设（工商业贷款仍可用贷币，但须提高利息。）直接发放生产资料，目前尚无经验，但必须遵守三个原则：（一）物美价廉。（二）群众不易采购的。（三）有倡导价值，不能盲目进行，同时必须与物资经营、平稳物价相结合，避免积压物资和赔累贷款。折实在物价波动时，债权人可能一时遭到损失，但从全面长期计算，仍然可以保本，甚至有利，如能与物资经营结合，则更稳当。会议认为：合作社与互助组，是公营经济与群众个体经济联系的纽带，国家银行应很好扶助。有些合作社业务方向正确，为群众所拥护的，银行可将贷款交给它，使与其本身资金统一运用。合作社应对银行负责。如发现其业务经营违反贷款方针，又一时不能改造者，可立即追回贷款。会议最后讨论制定了今年冬季工作计划。
