　　Important Correction
    In the New China News Agency's dispatch on the 2nd, "Northeast China's Military and Civilians Joyously Celebrate the Liberation of Shenyang" (see the headline on page one of the 4th's issue of this newspaper), the last sentence reads "will undoubtedly greatly accelerate the liberation of all of China." The word "达到" (dadao, reach) is a mistake for "大大" (dada, greatly).

　　重要更正
    新华社二日所播“全东北军民欢庆沈阳解放”（见四日本报一版头条）消息末句“无疑将要达到加速全中国的解放”，其中“达到”二字，系“大大”之误。
