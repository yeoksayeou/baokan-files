　　Introduction to Haizhou Xinpu
    Haizhou, now known as Donghai, is located in the northeastern part of Jiangsu Province, bordering the Yellow Sea to the east. It is the terminus of the Longhai Railway, a major artery running east-west across China. Eighty li to its east is Lianyungang. The Haizheng Highway runs west through Xuzhou, Shangqiu, and Kaifeng, directly reaching Zhengzhou. The Tongyu Highway passes through here, connecting Ganyu to the north and Nantong on the north bank of the Yangtze River to the south. Waterways include the Yan River and the Yunliang River, which converge east of the city and flow into the sea at Linhongkou. The commercial center is Xinpu Town, ten li east of the city on the east bank of the Yan River, with electric lights, running water, flour mills, and more. Agricultural products and salt from northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong, as well as goods transported inland from Shanghai and Qingdao, are all distributed from here. Therefore, the two places are often referred to as "Xinhai" together. The population totals over 100,000. Haizhou is surrounded by mountains on three sides, and mineral resources include mica, gold, and asbestos. In particular, the rare phosphorus mine on Jinpingshan in the south of the city is an important resource for the chemical fertilizer industry, with reserves of 45 million tons. However, under the reactionary policy of the U.S. imperialists supporting the Japanese invaders, the traitorous Kuomintang government, at the behest of MacArthur, repeatedly transported large quantities of local phosphorus ore and salt to Japan.
    In 1945, after the Japanese invaders surrendered, Chiang Kai-shek immediately colluded with enemy and puppet forces to occupy the area, stationing a full reorganized division of troops there on a regular basis. This time, under the powerful deterrence of our army, the defending enemy fled in panic. After Xinhai was liberated by us, the supply line of the Kuomintang bandit army from Shanghai through Lianyungang and Haizhou to Xuzhou, the most important military base in East China, was cut off, which was a major blow to the enemies besieged in Xuzhou.

　　海州新浦介绍
    海州今称东海，位于江苏省东北部，东临黄海，为横贯中国东西大动脉陇海铁路之终点。其东八十里为连云港，公路有海郑线西经徐州、商邱、开封直达郑州。并有通榆公路经此北通赣榆、南至长江北岸之南通。水道有盐河、运粮河在城东合流，出临洪口入海。商业中心在城东十里盐河东岸之新浦镇，有电灯、自来水、面粉厂等。苏北、鲁南之农产品、食盐及由上海、青岛内运货物均以此为集散地。故两地常被合称为“新海”。人口共十余万。海州三面环山、矿产有云母、金、石绵等，尤以城南锦屏山之我国稀有的磷矿，为化学肥料工业的重要资源，储藏量达四千五百万吨。但在美帝国主义扶植日寇的反动政策下，国民党卖国政府听命麦克阿瑟，曾屡次将该地磷矿及食盐大批运往日本。
    一九四五年日寇投降，蒋介石即勾结敌伪盘踞该地，经常驻有一个整编师的兵力。此次在我军威震慑下，守敌仓皇逃跑。新海为我解放后，国民党匪军自上海经连云港、海州至华东最重要的军事基地徐州的补给线从此中断，这对困守徐州的敌人是一个重大的打击。（新华社华东电）
