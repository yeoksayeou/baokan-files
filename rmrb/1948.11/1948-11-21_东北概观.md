Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 18th. Northeast China is vast in territory. It starts from the mouth of the Tumen River, traces the Ussuri River upwards, reaches the banks of the Heilongjiang River and connects with the East Siberian Plain of the Soviet Union. In the southeast, it faces the People's Democratic Republic of Korea across the Yalu River. The northwestern part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is adjacent to Siberia and the Mongolian People's Republic, controlling a total of 8,338 kilometers of the national border. In the south, the Liaodong Peninsula protrudes into the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea, echoing Shandong across the sea, with a coastline extending approximately 800 kilometers. To the southwest, it connects with Rehe and Hebei. Currently, it has a total area of ​​1,017,000 square kilometers and a population of 34 million. Under the jurisdiction of the highest political authority in Northeast China—the Northeast Administrative Committee—are the eight provinces of Songjiang, Hejiang (the original Mudanjiang Province has been incorporated into the above two provinces), Nenjiang, Heilongjiang, Liaobei, Jilin, Andong, and Liaoning, as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the three special municipalities of Shenyang, Harbin, and Changchun. More than 70% of the rural areas in the entire region have completed land reform, and the remaining new areas will also strive to complete it before the spring plowing next year. The provinces govern a total of 187 large, medium, and small cities. Except for the cities recently recovered, most have resumed economic construction, and some have even achieved development, vigorously supporting the war. The territory has well-developed transportation. In addition to inland rivers, a dense network of railways and highways connects the major and medium-sized cities. Postal and telecommunications are very convenient. Electricity, telegraph, and telephone services are available in all cities, and long-distance telephone services can reach larger towns. The territory is relatively rich in resources, with coal and iron being the most abundant minerals, and mining is carried out throughout the region. The reserves of Hegang coal in Hejiang alone account for one-fifth of the country's total. The forests densely covering the Wanda Mountains, Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, and Changbai Mountains rank first in the country, with a total storage volume of 3.5 billion cubic meters. Three-quarters of our increased timber production next year will be equal to the total number of railway sleepers in all of Guannei. Agricultural products are mainly soybeans and sorghum, and the fertile Nenjiang and Songhua River basins are the best grain-producing areas in Northeast China. The peasants who have been liberated have a high enthusiasm for production. The increased production in Heilongjiang and Songjiang provinces alone this year has reached 3 million shi. There are also many local specialties, in addition to ginseng, mink, and Ula grass, there are also bear paws and deer antlers in the mountains, and fish in the coastal and inland rivers. All these constitute superior conditions for the development of Northeast China's new democratic economy. The main task now before the Party, government, army, and people of Northeast China is to shift from agriculture to economic construction with industry as the main focus, especially to rapidly restore and develop military and civilian industrial production in order to better prosper the national economy and support the liberation war in Guannei. Cultural construction will also be raised to a position second only to economic construction. A large number of new regular specialized schools, theaters, hospitals, etc. will be opened in a planned manner, and the political and scientific knowledge level of the staff will be improved through schools, newspapers, and various cultural and educational work. A large number of excellent new cadres, boldly cultivated and promoted in various places, will continuously emerge in production and construction and various work positions.

　　东北概观
    【新华社哈尔滨十八日电】东北幅员广大，东起图门江口溯乌苏里江而上，北达黑龙江沿岸与苏联东部西伯利亚平原相接，东南隔鸭绿江与朝鲜人民民主主义共和国相望，西北部内蒙自治区与西伯利亚及蒙古人民共和国毗邻，掌握全部国境线八千三百三十八公里。南有辽东半岛突出于黄海及渤海之间，与山东隔海呼应，海岸线延长约八百公里。西南接热河与河北。现有总面积一百零一万七千余平方公里，人口三千四百万。在东北最高政权机关——东北行政委员会的辖下，有松江、合江（原牡丹江省已划入以上两省）、嫩江、黑龙江、辽北、吉林、安东、辽宁八省及内蒙古自治区和沈阳、哈尔滨、长春三个特别市。全区百分之七十以上的农村，均已完成了土地改革，其余新区亦将争取在明年春耕前完成。各省管辖的大中小城市共有一百八十七个。除最近收复之城市外，绝大部分已恢复了经济建设，有的并获得了发展，有力的支援了战争。境内交通发达，除内河外，密如蛛网的铁路、公路线联结着各大中小城市。邮电甚便，电灯及电报、电话各城市均有，长途电话可达各较大之乡镇。境内物产较富，矿产以煤和铁最为宏厚，全境均有开采。仅合江鹤冈煤的蕴藏量即占全国五分之一。密布完达山脉、大小兴安岭、长白山脉等地的森林，居全国第一，总积蓄量为三十五亿立方米。我明年采木增产量的四分之三，即等于关内所有铁路枕木的总和。农产以大豆、高粱为主，沃野千里的嫩江、松花江流域为东北最佳之产粮区。翻身后的农民，生产情绪甚高，仅黑龙江、松江两省今年之增产量即达三百万石。各地的特产亦多，除人参、貂皮、乌拉草外，尚有山区之熊掌、鹿茸，及沿海、内河之鱼类等。所有这些组成了发展东北新民主主义经济的优越条件。现在摆在东北党政军民面前的主要任务，即是由农业转入以工业为主的经济建设，特别是迅速恢复与发展军需和民用工业生产，以更好繁荣国民经济，支援关内解放战争。文化建设，也将提到仅次于经济建设的地位。大量新的正规专科学校、剧院、医院等即将有计划的开办起来，通过学校、报纸及各种文化教育工作以提高工作人员的政治和科学知识水平。大批的优秀新干部，在各地大胆培养与提拔下，将源源涌上生产建设和各种工作岗位。
