[Taihang News] After the heavy rains this year in Beiwang Village, Fourth District, Xiuwu, many fields were flooded, causing great distress to the villagers. Meng Zhaoyi, the former chairman of the village farmers' association, discussed boiling saltpeter with villagers Wu Tongran and Wu Yurui. He said, "Qiao Shilin and seven others in the North Street boiled saltpeter for half a month and earned 7,000 jin of wheat. Each person even received 50 jin of salt." Yurui said, "Just us alone won't be enough." Tongran said, "As long as we explain the benefits clearly to everyone, people will join. I'll go around and talk to them." In less than three days, he had contacted twelve households (six middle peasant households and six poor peasant households). They held a meeting and planned not only to boil saltpeter but also to open an oil press and help each other with fieldwork. Someone said, "You can't do anything without capital." Meng Zhaoyi said, "Boiling saltpeter doesn't require money; just soil is enough. As for the oil press, doesn't every family grow some sesame? There are only three ways to use sesame: one is to exchange it for oil to eat, another is to exchange it for fertilizer for the land, and the third is to sell it for money. Put the sesame into our cooperative, priced according to the market, and you can earn money without losing weight. If that's not enough, we can borrow some grain from the trading company." Everyone said, "Right! You can sail a boat on borrowed water." Everyone declared their amounts and gathered three shi and four dou of sesame. Someone suggested, "Since we're all one family, we have to be thick-skinned and not petty. If there's anything wrong, speak up. Now we emphasize discussion." Meng Zhaoyi said, "If anyone has a mistake, point it out; don't keep it to yourself. If anyone hears any gossip, they can come here and talk about it to prevent provocation." Five of the twelve people were cadres (one street leader, one in charge of finance and grain, one in charge of anti-conscription, one self-defense captain, and Meng Zhaoyi). Yurui, who was in charge of anti-conscription, said, "I'm busy with public affairs and will delay production." Wu Wand said, "I'm the street leader, and I can't go to the fields for a half-day or two every day. Aren't you all just picking up after me?" Everyone said, "One person can't handle three people's work. If public affairs are busy, everyone will go, and we'll come back after they're done. Public affairs won't be delayed." After everyone's discussion, they divided the work and established rules. Wu Wanyu was old, experienced in managing a household, and literate, so he was asked to keep accounts and manage household affairs. Wu Changjiang was experienced in field work, so he was asked to lead the fieldwork. Meng Zhaoyi ran errands and handled public affairs, and went automatically when there were assignments. Xie Zixiang was in charge of boiling saltpeter, and Wu Wande was in charge of the oil press. Each person was assigned seven work points per day. Because everyone swept saltpeter soil early in the morning, the first three points in the morning were not counted. All field work was assigned points. No work points were recorded for those who did not do fieldwork. The thirteen women with labor power were also organized to join, with different work points assigned based on their physical strength and work quality, ranging from seven points, six points, to five points. If there was too much work at the oil press and they couldn't keep up, anyone's women or children could be called upon to help with the bellows. One person's daily wage was two sheng of corn. A donkey earned one and a half work points, which was three sheng of corn per day. Accounts were settled in the autumn, with surpluses compensating for shortages. Those who were heroes and models would be rewarded, and the cooperative was named "Labor Cooperative." The slogan was "Base on Labor," "Eat and Dress by Labor." The daily work was planned and assigned in the evening of the previous day, and the strengths were unified. Everyone worked very hard. They didn't need to be told to work; they were all very proactive. Now, after boiling saltpeter for nineteen days, they have earned a total of over one hundred jin of salt and sixty jin of saltpeter, equivalent to 410,400 yuan, which can buy 957 jin of wheat. There is still a pile of saltpeter soil stored. Changjiang said, "I wouldn't trade it for five shi of wheat." The oil press has pressed seven shi and five dou of sesame in fifteen days, which can earn 370 jin of wheat. The two items together have earned 444,200 yuan, which can buy 1,327 jin of wheat. Everyone said, "If we keep working like this until the New Year, every family will be able to buy a livestock to use." Many people are asking to join their labor cooperative, and some are asking them to send someone to lead everyone to start another one. Wang Yinwu complained, "Zhaoyi set it up without even telling us." Wu Changgeng wished he could also buy a share. Wu Wanjiang, nicknamed "Old Monster," also ran to the labor cooperative and said, "My thinking has changed now. I'll do whatever you tell me to do in the future. Isn't the mutual aid group supposed to solve the difficulties of the poor?" They are preparing to accept the opinions of the masses, send someone to expand the organization, and help other people engage in labor mutual aid. This labor cooperative still has a shortcoming, which is that women and children helping in the cooperative are not counted as work, which will affect consolidation in the long run. Because among the households joining the cooperative, some have women and children, while others do not.

　　以力为本熬硝打油
  　孟昭义劳力社半月赚洋四十万
    【太行讯】修武四区北王村今年大雨后，好多地被水淹了，群众愁得没办法，该村前任农会主席孟昭义和村民吴同然、吴玉瑞便商量熬硝。他介绍说：“北街乔士林七个人熬了半个月硝，就赚了七千斤麦子，一个人还分了五十斤盐”。玉瑞说：“光我们还不行”。同然说：“只要给大家把好处说清楚，就会有人来。我给串通串通”。不到三天，他就串通了十二户（中农六户贫农六户）。他们开了个会，除计划熬硝外，还计划开油房，互助下地。有人说：“无本钱不能干”。孟昭义说：“熬硝不用钱，有土就行。油房，谁家还不种点芝麻？种芝麻也不过三条路：一条路换油吃，一条路换麻生上地，一条路卖钱。把芝麻入在咱里边，按市作价，不泄秤还能赚钱。如果不够，再从贸易公司借些粮食”。大家说：“对！借水能行舟”。大家自报了一下，集中起三石四斗芝麻。有人提议说：“咱们既是一家人就得皮厚些，不能尖薄，有啥不对，说说，现在又兴讨论”。孟昭义说：“谁有错误就提出来，不要沤在肚里。谁听到什么闲话，也可以来里边说，防止挑拨。”十二个人里边有五个是干部（街长一个、财粮一个、抗勤一个、自卫队长一个和孟昭义）。抗勤玉瑞说：“我公事忙，要耽误生产哩”。吴万德说：“我当这街长，整天一晌两晌不能下地，大家不是光给我拾拉？”大家说：“一个人不能办三个人事。公事忙了，大家都去，办罢就回来，公事还能耽误？”经过大家讨论，进行了分工，又规定了制度。吴万玉年纪大，管家有经验，识字，叫他记帐管家事。吴长江对地活有经验，叫他领导地活。孟昭义跑外办公事，有差自动去。谢子祥管熬硝，吴万德管油房。每人每天订七分工。因为每天早起大家都扫盐土，早上三分都不算。做地活都有分。不做地活不记工。十三个有劳力的妇女，也组织进去，按身体强弱和劳动好坏，分别定七分、六分、五分不等。如果油房活多赶不开，不管谁家妇女或小孩，叫来拉拉风箱帮帮忙也可以。一个人一天工资是二升玉茭。一个驴顶一个半工，每天是三升玉茭。秋后算帐，长除短补。谁是英雄模范，还要奖励，订名为“劳力社”。口号是“以力为本”，“有吃有穿靠劳动”。每天的活都要在头一天晚上计划了力量，统一分配了才干。每天活差不多都要在晚上说说。大家干的很有劲。做活不用叫，都很自动。现在熬了十九天硝，共赚了一百多斤盐，六十多斤硝，合洋四十一万零四百元，能买麦子九百五十七斤。现在还存有一堆盐土。长江说：“五石麦子也不换给他。”油坊十五天共打了七石五斗芝麻，能赚麦子三百七十斤。两宗共赚洋四十四万四千二百元，能买麦子一千三百廿七斤。大家说：“照这样干到过年，一家保险买个牲口使唤”。好多群众要求参加他们的劳力社，有的人要求他们分出一个人来领导大家再搞一个。王银五瞒怨的说：“昭义弄起来也不给咱说说”。吴长更恨不得也要求入个股。吴万江外号叫老怪物，也跑到劳力社说：“我现在思想变啦，以后叫我干啥我干啥。互助组不是解决穷人困难咧？”他们准备接受群众意见，分出一个人来扩大组织，帮助别的群众也闹劳力互助。这个劳力社现在还有一个缺点，就是妇女儿童在社帮忙不算工，长期下去会影响巩固。因为入社各户里边，有的家有妇女小孩，有的人家没有。
