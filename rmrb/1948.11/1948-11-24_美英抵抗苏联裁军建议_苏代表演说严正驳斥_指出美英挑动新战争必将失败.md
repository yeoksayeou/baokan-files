　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: TASS reports: The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly reviewed the report of the Disarmament Subcommittee established by the committee from the 11th to the 13th. After beginning work on October 14th, the subcommittee, under the obstruction of the US-British bloc, rejected the Soviet proposal on prohibiting atomic weapons and a one-third reduction of armaments by the five major powers within the next year on October 25th, and passed the Belgian proposal, which was essentially against disarmament. In the fierce debate of the Political and Security Committee's review of the subcommittee's proposal, Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky gave lengthy speeches on both the 11th and 13th, refuting the speeches of the US and British representatives and the Belgian proposal. Vyshinsky pointed out: The Belgian proposal, which fully reflects the intentions of the US-British bloc, proposes so-called "disarmament depends on the establishment of an atmosphere of international mutual trust," which is actually opposing disarmament now, because the mutual distrust is caused by the US-British arms race and war propaganda. Passing a disarmament resolution is precisely a step forward towards establishing mutual trust. The Belgian proposal also advocates that the United Nations General Armaments Committee should first collect armaments information from various countries before discussing the issue of disarmament, which is also an attempt to oppose disarmament now under the guise of collecting information. Vyshinsky emphasized: The real reason why the US-British bloc "resists the Soviet disarmament proposal is due to their policy, as Stalin said, which is a policy of aggression and launching a new war. But there is no doubt that their policy will surely fail miserably." On the 13th, the US-British bloc in the Political Committee mobilized their voting machine, rejected the Soviet disarmament proposal, which truly represents the wishes of the majority of the world's people, and passed the Belgian proposal, which refuses disarmament.

　　At the meeting on the 11th, Kuomintang representative Jiang Tingfu, echoing the sentiments of his American masters, opposed disarmament on the grounds that the Jiang family's small court was in a precarious situation, and issued the despicable lie that "the Soviet Union once equipped 30,000 Japanese troops to fight alongside the People's Liberation Army." This lie was refuted on the spot. Ukrainian representative Manuilsky urged the chairman to pay attention, saying: It is not permissible to use the committee's platform to publish such slanderous remarks against member states of the United Nations.

　　In addition, after two weeks of heated debate, the discussion on the Greek issue, which began in the Political and Security Committee on October 25th, ended on the 10th of this month. The US and British representatives' attempt to turn the discussion into a kind of interrogation of Greece's northern neighboring countries, thereby covering up their crime of armed intervention in Greece, did not succeed. The representatives of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries used irrefutable documents to illustrate the truth of the Greek issue and exposed the crimes of US and British intervention in Greece. However, the US-British bloc in the committee used its "majority" to reject the Soviet proposal on the 10th, which called for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Greece and the termination of the illegal activities of the "Balkan Committee." The Australian proposal, which requested that Albania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Greece hold a meeting in Paris to seek a solution to the current dispute, was unanimously adopted by the committee. The Soviet representative, who has consistently supported a peaceful resolution of the Greek issue, supported this proposal.

### 美英抵抗苏联裁军建议　苏代表演说严正驳斥  指出美英挑动新战争必将失败

　　美英抵抗苏联裁军建议
  　苏代表演说严正驳斥
    指出美英挑动新战争必将失败
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社讯：联大政治安全委员会于十一日至十三日审查该委员会所设裁军小组委员会的报告，后者于十月十四日开始工作后，在美英集团的阻挠下，曾于十月二十五日否决了苏联所提关于禁止原子武器及五强在今后一年内裁军三分之一的提案，通过了实质上反对裁军的比利时提案。在政治安全委员会这次审查小组提案的激烈辩论中，苏代表团团长维辛斯基于十一、十三两日曾两次发表长篇演说，驳斥美英代表的发言及比利时的提案。维氏指出：完全反映美英集团之企图的比利时提案，提出所谓“裁军依赖于国际互信空气的建立”，实际上是反对现在裁军，因为互不信任是美英的军备竞赛与战争宣传所造成的，而通过裁军决议，则正是向建立互信前进了一步。比利时提案又主张由联合国普通军备委员会首先收集各国军备情报，然后再谈裁军问题，这也是企图在收集情报的掩盖下，反对现在裁军。维氏强调指出：美英集团“抵抗苏联裁军建议的真正原因，是由于它们的政策，正如斯大林所说的，是侵略和发动新战争的政策。但毫无疑问的，它们这种政策必将惨败”。十三日，美英集团在政委会拨动了它们的表决机器，否决了真正代表世界大多数人民愿望的苏联裁军建议，并通过了拒绝裁军的比利时提案。
    在十一日会议上，仰承其美国主子鼻息的国民党代表蒋廷黻，以蒋家小朝廷处境危急为由，反对裁军，并发出“苏联曾装备日军三万人与人民解放军并肩作战”的下流谎言。这一谎言当场遇到驳斥。乌克兰代表曼努意斯基促请主席注意说：利用委员会讲坛发表这种诽谤联合国会员国的言论，是不能容许的。
    又讯，政治安全委员会于十月二十五日开始的关于希腊问题的讨论，经两周激辩后，于本月十日结束。美英代表企图将讨论变成对希腊北邻国家的一种审讯，从而掩盖其武装干涉希腊罪行的目的并未达到。苏联和新民主国家的代表，以无可辩驳的文件说明了希腊问题的真象，揭露了美英干涉希腊的罪行。但委员会中的美英集团以“多数”于十日否决了苏联所提外国军撤离希腊及终止非法的“巴尔干委员会”活动的建议。澳洲所提要求阿、保、南、希四国在巴黎举行会议以寻求解决目前纠纷方法的建议，为委员会所一致通过。一贯支持和平解决希腊问题的苏联代表，支持此一建议。
