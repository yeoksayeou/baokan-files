Xinhua News Agency, North China, 31st dispatch: When the Kuomintang generals are all like dead dogs, unable to bite a single hair of the People's Liberation Army, and are being chased by the People's Liberation Army until they have nowhere to go, Bai Chongxi and Fu Zuoyi, these two dogs who seem to still have some life in them, have been selected by the American imperialists and become the Kuomintang's treasures. Chiang Kai-shek is already a corpse, without a soul, and no one believes him anymore, including his so-called "students" and "cadres." Under American instructions, Chiang Kai-shek promoted Bai Chongxi and Fu Zuoyi. Bai Chongxi is now the commander of the Xuzhou and Hankou "Suppression Headquarters," and Fu Zuoyi is the commander of the northern front. The Americans and Chiang Kai-shek are now relying on these two dogs to hold back the People's Liberation Army. But exactly how many months Bai Chongxi and Fu Zuoyi have left is something even their masters and themselves do not know. Chiang Kai-shek has recently been living in Beiping. In two weeks, he personally sent away three large armies: Fan Hanjie, Zheng Dongguo, and Liao Yaoxiang. His mission is complete, he has nothing left to do in Beiping, and yesterday he already slipped back to Nanjing. Chiang Kai-shek is not Xiang Yu and does not have the sense of shame of "having no face to see the elders of Jiangdong." He still wants to live, still wants to play some tricks to stimulate the already scattered military and popular morale. He racked his brains and came up with a brilliant plan: a sneak attack on Shijiazhuang. Chiang Kai-shek originally wanted Fu Zuoyi to assemble a light force to sneak attack Jinan, but Fu Zuoyi refused. Fu Zuoyi agreed to the sneak attack on Shijiazhuang, but both sides had to invest. Fu Zuoyi provided cavalry, and Chiang Kai-shek provided infantry, along with some tanks and demolition teams, and marched south from Beiping. It was truly exceptionally brave; they reached the Wangdu area in a week. According to intelligence from the past few days, this General Zheng seems to sense something is amiss and is calling for reinforcements from Beiping. Again, both sides are investing: Fu Zuoyi is sending the 35th Army, and Chiang Kai-shek is sending the 16th Army, heading south from Zhuozhou. Here a question arises: do they even want Beiping? Beiping is now so empty, with only the Youth Army 208th Division there. Tongzhou is also empty, and the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway only has a sparse number of soldiers. In short, the entire northern front of Chiang Kai-shek, the entire Fu Zuoyi system, will probably collapse in just a few months, yet they are still there dreaming of Shijiazhuang!

    蒋傅匪整个北方战线只有几个月就要完蛋
    妄想偷袭石家庄究竟他们要不要北平
    【新华社华北三十一电】当着国民党军队的将军们都象一些死狗，咬不动人民解放军一根毫毛，而被人民解放军赶打的走头无路的时候，白崇禧、傅作义这两匹似乎还有一点生命力的狗子就被美国帝国主义者所选中，成了国民党的宝贝了。蒋介石已经是一具僵尸，没有灵魂了，什么人也不再相信他，包括他的所谓“学生”和“干部”在内。在美国指令之下，蒋介石提拔了白崇禧、傅作义。白崇禧现在已是徐州、汉口两个“剿总”的统帅，傅作义则是北线的统帅，美国人和蒋介石现在就是依靠这样两匹狗子挡一挡人民解放军。但是究竟白崇禧、傅作义还有几个月的寿命，连他们的主人和他们自己也不知道。蒋介石最近时期是住在北平，在两个星期内，由他经手送掉了范汉杰、郑洞国、廖耀湘三支大军。他的任务已经完毕，他在北平已经无事可做，昨日业已溜回南京。蒋介石不是项羽，并无“无面目见江东父老”那种羞耻心理。他还想活下去，还想弄一点花样去刺激一下已经离散的军心和人心。亏他挖空心思，想出了偷袭石家庄这样一条妙计。蒋介石原先是要傅作义组一支轻兵去偷袭济南的，傅作义不干。偷袭石家庄，傅作义答应了；但要两家出本钱。傅作义出骑兵，蒋介石出步兵，附上些坦克和爆炸队，从北平南下了。真是异常勇敢，一个星期到达了望都地区；指挥官是郑挺锋。从这几天的情报看来，这位郑将军似乎感觉有些什么不妥之处，叫北平派援军。又是两家合股，傅作义派的是第三十五军，蒋介石派的是第十六军，正经涿州南下。这里发生一个问题：究竟他们要不要北平？现在北平是这样的空虚，只有一个青年军二零八师在那里。通州也空了，平绥东段也只是稀稀拉拉的几个兵了。总之，整个蒋介石的北方战线，整个傅作义系统，大概只有几个月就要完蛋，他们却还在那里做石家庄的梦！
