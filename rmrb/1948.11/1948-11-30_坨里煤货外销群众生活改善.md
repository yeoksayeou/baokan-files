(Beiyue Electric) Since Liangxiang Hetaogou (including more than ten villages, part of the Tuoli mining area) was liberated by our army last May, Tuoli, with the vigorous support of our democratic government, has restored its market and organized the export of coal and mountain goods. Industry and commerce are thriving, and people's lives have improved significantly. The two larger coal mines, east and west, sold more than 1.9 million jin of coal in October alone, exchanging it for more than 30,000 jin of grain. Seven small coal kilns sold more than 60,000 jin of coal, exchanging it for more than 1,000 jin of grain and salt. There are currently twenty small kilns preparing to start work. Sixteen coal yards have been established within Tuoli, and large coal carts and livestock come and go in a constant stream every day. Coal miners can earn ten jin of millet per person per day (doubled in winter). Persimmons, Jing strips, and medicinal materials produced can also be exported in a timely manner. Eight shops have opened for business in Hebei Village, and many more are cleaning up their storefronts in preparation for opening. Some of the camels that used to be exported (originally more than 300) have returned, with over fifty. The villagers are saying, "This year, we can make a living!"

　　坨里煤货外销群众生活改善
    【北岳电】良乡河套沟（包括十余村，是坨里矿区的一部分），于去年五月为我军解放后，坨里在我民主政府大力扶植下，恢复了集市，组织了煤及山货的外销，工商业日趋繁荣，群众生活已有显著改善。东西两个较大煤矿，仅十月份即售出煤一百九十余万斤，换回粮食三万余斤。七个小煤窑售出煤六万余斤，换回粮食、食盐千余斤。现还有二十个小窑正准备开工。坨里以内已设立了十六个煤场，每天运煤大车、牲畜络绎不绝。采煤工人每人每日可挣小米十斤（冬季加倍）。所产柿子、荆条、药材也能及时输出。现河北村已有八家商铺开张营业，还有好多正在打扫门面准备开张。过去出口的骆驼（原有三百余头）已回来五十余头。老乡们都说：“今年的生活可有办法了”。
