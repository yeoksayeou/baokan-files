Southeast Asian Youth Groups Call for an End to British Imperialist Suppression of the Malayan People
Malayan People's Anti-British Army Formed

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th] Electric News Agency, London, 24th: The British Communist Youth League's organ "Challenge" weekly, this issue publishes a statement from the China Liberated Area Youth Federation, the All-China Student Federation, the Vietnam Democratic Youth League, the Indonesian Youth Movement Association, the All-India Student Federation, and the South India Youth Federation, calling on British youth to strive to stop the Malayan war. The statement said that the measures taken by the British government to suppress the Malayan people are a disgrace to any civilized country. A reward of fifteen thousand pounds has been used to offer a reward for the heads of twelve leaders of the Malayan youth movement, including Li Song (transliteration), a member of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Council. Emergency laws have been passed, according to which even a person carrying an unlicensed typewriter may be sentenced to death. The statement continued, the Wall Street imperialists want to turn Malaya into a possible base for their next world war that they are preparing, and to exhaust Malaya's rubber and tin to promote their rearmament movement. The statement called on peace-loving British youth not to allow their government, army, manpower, materials, and national honor to be sold out for the benefit of the Americans.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th] TASS News: The Soviet Armed Forces Department's organ, Red Star, recently published a special article by Colonel Fedorovich on the development of the situation in British Malaya, stating: A large-scale national liberation movement is developing in British Malaya and other Southeast Asian countries. After the Second World War, the British Labour government tried to restore its colonial order in Malaya. Under the dual oppression of local feudal nobles and British colonial heads, the Malayan people are in extreme distress. All this has promoted the development of the Malayan national liberation movement and turned into an open armed struggle in June of this year. According to reports from foreign journalists from Singapore: the Malayan People's Anti-British Army, with a strength of 10,000 people, has been formed. According to newspaper reports, the armed struggle began in the northern region and then spread to the vicinity of Ipoh and Kuala Lumpur and southern Malaya - Johor and Pahang.
    In order to suppress the Malayan national liberation movement, the British colonialists declared a state of emergency throughout Malaya, declared all progressive groups in Malaya illegal, and carried out large-scale arrests. They are trying to incite national hatred and provoke animosity between Malaysians and Chinese. Not only that, but they have also mobilized a large number of land, sea, and air forces. Britain currently has 50,000 troops in Malaya ready to be deployed, to cooperate with the police. Britain is acting in accordance with the resolutions of the last joint meeting of the US and British Chiefs of Staff in Washington. The resolution pointed out that Britain must end the Malayan incident as soon as possible, because the latter is very important to the US "defense" plan.
    However, despite the great superiority of the British army in terms of quantity and war technology, the British authorities have still failed to achieve their goal. The result of their barbaric measures, such as destroying villages, burning grain, and driving people into the jungle, has aroused greater hatred among the Malayan people for the enslavers and protests from democrats in many countries. The Malayan people are waging a struggle to defend freedom and fight for the right to independence under difficult conditions. They are using brave and tenacious resistance to counter the British colonialists' attempt to re-enslave the Malayan people.

### 东南亚各国青年团体呼吁　制止英帝镇压马来亚人民  马来亚人民抗英军已组成

　　东南亚各国青年团体呼吁
  　制止英帝镇压马来亚人民
    马来亚人民抗英军已组成
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】电通社伦敦二十四日讯：英国共产主义青年团机关刊“挑战”周刊，本期刊载中国解放区青联、中国全国学联、越南民主青年团、印尼青年运动协会、全印度学联及南印度青联关于呼吁英国青年努力制止马来亚战事的文告。文告称，英国政府为了镇压马来亚人民而采取的办法，乃是任何文明国家的耻辱。一万五千镑的酬金，已被用以悬赏缉拿十二位马来亚青年运动领袖的头颅，这些领袖中包括世界民主青联理事会理事李宋（译音）。紧急法已被通过，依照该法，甚至携有一架无执照的打字机的人，都可能被处死刑。文告继称，华尔街的帝国主义者们，要把马来亚变成他们正在准备着的下次世界大战的可能基地，要耗尽马来亚的橡皮和锡，以推进其重整军备运动。文告呼吁爱好和平的英国青年，不要允许他们的政府、军队、人力、物资和民族荣誉，为了美国人的利益而被出卖。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社讯：苏联武装部队部机关报红星报顷发表斐多洛维奇上校论英属马来亚局势发展的专文称：大规模的民族解放运动正在英属马来亚和东南亚其他国家发展中。第二次世界大战以后，英国工党政府力图恢复其在马来亚的殖民地秩序。在当地封建贵族和英国殖民头子的双重压迫下，马来亚人民处在极困苦的情况下。这一切就促成了马来亚民族解放运动的发展，并于本年六月变为公开的武装斗争。据外国记者自新加坡报导：实力共达一万人的马来亚人民抗英军已经组成。据报纸消息判断，武装斗争系在北部地区开始，后又扩展至怡保和吉隆坡周围及马来亚南部——柔佛州和彭亨州。
    英国殖民者为了镇压马来亚民族解放运动，宣布了马来亚全境处于紧急状态，将马来亚一切进步团体宣布为非法，并实行大规模的逮捕。他们正图煽动民族仇恨，激起马来亚人与中国人之间的敌意。不仅如此，他们还调来了大量的陆海空军。英国在马来亚现共有待机出动的军队五万人，以与警察相配合。英国正在按照上次在华盛顿举行的美英参谋长联席会议的决议行动。该决议指出：英国必须尽早结束马来亚事件，因为后者对于美国“防御”计划颇为重要。
    但是，尽管英军具有数量上及战争技术上的极大优势，英国当局仍未能达到目的。他们采取毁灭村庄、焚烧谷物并将人民驱入丛林等野蛮措施的结果，激起了马来亚人民对奴役者更大的仇恨和许多国家民主人士的抗议。马来亚人民正在困难的状况下进行着保卫自由和争取独立权利的斗争。他们正以勇敢和坚强的抵抗，来反击英国殖民者重行奴役马来亚人民的企图。
