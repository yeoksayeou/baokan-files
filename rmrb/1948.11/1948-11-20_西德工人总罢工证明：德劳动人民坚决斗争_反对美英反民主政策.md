　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. TASS reports: Regardless of the various obstructions from right-wing Social Democratic Party leader Schumacher and others, the wave of the 24-hour general strike held on the 12th by eight million workers and staff to protest high living costs still swept across the Anglo-American joint occupation zone of Germany like a storm. Metalworkers, miners, railway workers, dockworkers, urban transport workers, postal workers, typesetters, etc., in major cities, ports, and mining areas all left their jobs on this day. Activities ceased at 170 coal mines and 35 metallurgical factories in the famous Ruhr industrial area. Cranes in the ports of Hamburg, Bremen, Kiel, and Duisburg remained still in their original positions. In the port of Bremen, despite the orders of the American military government, cargo was not unloaded from ships, nor was cargo loaded onto ships from the shore. Shops closed, and newspapers were not published. Even in some cities, despite prohibitions, workers still held gatherings and demonstrations. Some places even passed resolutions to continue the strike until their demands were met. Buckler, Chairman of the British Zone Trade Union Committee, announced that this strike was only the beginning of the firm struggle between the trade union and the laboring people. The press office of the German Socialist Unity Party issued a statement condemning the unwillingness of certain leaders in the West German trade unions to announce the strike. The statement pointed out that West German workers resolutely demanded that wages be increased in accordance with prices, that production committees should have the right to vote in factory management, and that basic industrial sectors and credit institutions should become public property.

　　In its commentary on the West German general strike, the Soviet Labor Daily pointed out that the policies of the US and UK to split German unification, striving to transform West Germany into a colonial object of exploitation and a base for military adventures, have caused economic chaos, the destruction and impoverishment of the masses, and countless disturbances in West Germany. This general strike in West Germany proves that the German laboring people oppose this anti-democratic policy of the US and UK.

　　西德工人总罢工证明：
    德劳动人民坚决斗争　反对美英反民主政策
    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社报导：不顾右翼社会民主党领袖舒马赫等人的各种阻挠，八百万工人、职员为抗议生活费用高涨而于十二日举行之二十四小时总罢工的浪潮，仍象风暴一样地席卷了两德联合占领区。各大城市、港口和矿区的金属工人、矿工、铁路工人、码头工人、城市运输工人、邮政工人、排字工人等，在这一天都离开了他们的工作。著名的鲁尔工业区的一百七十个煤矿和三十五个冶金工厂的活动停止了。土堡、不来梅、基尔和杜伊斯堡各港口的起重机，老是静止在它们原来的位置上。在不来梅港，尽管有美国军政府的命令，船上的货物仍然没有给搬运下来，岸上的货物也没有给搬上船去。商店关了门，报纸没有出版。甚至在某些城市，尽管有禁令，工人们仍然举行了集会和示威。有的地方还通过了继续罢工直至要求得到满足为止的决议。英占区职工会委员会主席巴克勒宣布：这次罢工只是职工会与劳动人民坚决斗争的开端。德国统一社会党新闻处发表声明，谴责西德职工会某些领袖中的不愿意宣布罢工。声明指出：西德工人们坚决要求工资要照物价增加，生产委员会在工厂管理上应有表决权，以及各基本工业部门和信用机关应变成公共财产。
    苏联劳动报在评论西德总罢工时指出，美英两国分裂德国统一，努力把西德转变为殖民地剥削对象及军事冒险基地的政策，造成了西德经济的混乱、群众的毁灭和贫困、及无数的骚乱。西德这次的总罢工，证明了德国劳动人民反对美英这一反民主的政策。
