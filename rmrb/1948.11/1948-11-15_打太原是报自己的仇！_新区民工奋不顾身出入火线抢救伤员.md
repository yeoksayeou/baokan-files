Supporting the Front, Capture Taiyuan!
　　“Fighting Taiyuan is to avenge ourselves!”
  　New District Laborers Risk Their Lives Entering and Leaving the Line of Fire to Rescue the Wounded
    [Jinzhong Electric] In the Jinzhong New District, the laborers participating in the Taiyuan campaign bravely rescued the wounded on the front line, in the face of intense enemy fire, regardless of their personal safety. Wu Mang, the head of the laborer squad in Xin County, led his fifteen squad members back and forth from the position three times, rescuing fourteen wounded soldiers, seizing one gun and three bags of foreign flour, and transferring the wounded six times. Squad member Kang Fuquan, from Hanjia Gou, Fourth District, Xin County, did not have enough grain to pay during the rule of Yan’s bandits. Once, during the autumn harvest, he was suddenly arrested by Yan’s bandits. After more than ten days, he took the opportunity to escape to Yangquan to do odd jobs. Only after the liberation of Xin County did he return home. Hearing about the attack on Taiyuan, he jumped up happily and said, "Fighting Taiyuan is to avenge ourselves and everyone!" During the Fengge Liang battle, he ran under the enemy's artillery tower three times in a row to rescue five wounded soldiers. Wu Pei, a laborer from Xijing Village, Fourth District, Taigu, although he was injured in the leg while transporting ammunition, the superior asked him to rest. He said, "I'm not going down. I came to fight Taiyuan. Yan Xishan forced me to sell my livestock and also conscripted me as a 'regular soldier.' I ran away twice and was almost caught and beaten to death by Yan’s bandits." Seeing a soldier fall, he ran up and immediately carried him down. Qin Shuzhi from Xiaoyi said to the team members under enemy fire: "We can only live well if we take Taiyuan. Let's go, I'll lead you!" Saying that, he rushed forward and rescued two wounded soldiers. Ma Shujiu rescued six wounded soldiers one after another, regardless of the intense artillery fire. Yan Guangcai of Qi County led his team members to volunteer to rescue the wounded. When the artillery fire was so heavy that they couldn't lift their heads, they rolled up. Lü Zhixin forgot about the sores on his legs and rescued the wounded six times in a row. Wang Qianjia, a laborer from Yangqu, after completing the road repair, saw that there were few stretcher-bearers, so he automatically joined the team and carried the stretcher twice. The third time, due to artillery fire and aircraft strafing, he lost contact with other team members. He ran up and carried a wounded soldier on his back. Although he vomited blood, he went to participate in transportation again. Chen Yinxiao from Pingding had his stretcher destroyed by enemy artillery fire. He went up alone. A comrade from the army asked, "Why are you alone?" He said, "I alone can top a stretcher." Saying that, he carried a wounded soldier on his back and ran down, running five miles before finding a good stretcher to replace it. He returned to rescue two wounded soldiers. Huang Tiedan from Yu County had his hand pierced by a bullet while rescuing the wounded on the pillbox. He didn't make a sound and rescued the wounded four times. The next day, he went to rescue the wounded again with his injury. Some rescued others to carry, others carried their own backs, and some carried three on one stretcher (carrying heavy numbers and light ones). On the way, they took care of the wounded soldiers meticulously. When the plane came, they first hid the wounded soldiers, boiled water, fed them, warmed them by the fire, helped them with defecation and urination, wiped their feces and urine with their own cotton wadding, and used their own money to buy cakes, pears, and cigarettes for the wounded soldiers. In the cold night, they took off their cotton coats and covered the wounded soldiers. Zhao Kanglu of Taigu was afraid that the wounded would have a stroke from urinating in the wind, so he put his own rice bowl in the quilt for him to catch the urine. Su Zuofu of Xiaoyi was afraid of freezing the wound on his foot, so he wrapped it with his own turban. Seeing a turban full of blood, the wounded said with emotion: "I'm really sorry." He replied: "What does this count for? Comrades are shedding blood to liberate us." (Logistics Reporter Group)

    支援前线，攻下太原！
　　“打太原是报自己的仇！”
  　新区民工奋不顾身出入火线抢救伤员
    【晋中电】晋中新区各县参战民工，在此次太原战役的火线上，在敌人猛烈炮火，奋不顾身，英勇抢救伤员。忻县民工班长五忙领导全班十五个队员往返阵地三次先后抢救下十四个伤员，并缴一支枪、三袋洋面，转送六次伤员。队员康福全，忻县四区韩家沟人，阎匪统治中打下粮不够交，一次收秋时突被阎匪抓去，十几日后乘机逃到阳泉打短工，忻县解放才回家。听见打太原，他高兴的跳着说：“打太原是报自己的仇，报大家的仇。”在风阁梁战斗中，接连三次跑在敌人炮台下，抢救五个伤员。太谷四区西井村民工武培，虽然自己在运送弹药时腿部受伤，上级叫下去休息，他说：“我不下去，我是来打太原的，阎锡山逼的我把牲口卖了，又抓当‘常备’，偷跑了两回，险些给阎匪抓住打死。”他看见一个战士倒了，跑上去马上背下来。孝义秦树枝，在敌人炮火下向队员说：“打下太原我们才能好活。走，我领着！”说着扑上去，抢救下两个伤员。马树玖不顾猛烈的炮火，先后救下六个伤员。祁县阎广才，率领本组队员自报奋勇抢救，炮火打的抬不起头，便滚着上去。吕智心忘记腿上的疮，连续抢救六次。阳曲民工王千家完成修路后，见担架队人少，即自动参加，抬了两次；第三次因炮火轰击，飞机扫射与其他队员失去联系，自己跑上去背下一个伤员，虽然吐了血又去参加运输。平定陈银小，担架被敌人的炮打坏了，他一人上去，部队同志问：“怎么你一个人？”他说：“我一个人便顶一付担架。”说着就背起一个伤员跑下去，直跑了五里路才找好担架换了抬去。他又返回来抢救下两个伤员。盂县黄铁蛋在炮楼上抢救时，手被子弹打穿，他不作声，抢救四次，第二天又带伤去抢救。有的是自己抢救别人抬，别人抬运自己背，也有的一付担架抬三个（抬重彩号捎带又抬轻的）。运送途中对伤员关照无微不至，飞机来了先隐蔽伤员，给伤员烧水，喂饭，烤火，扶着大小便，用自己的棉絮给擦屎尿，用自己的钱给伤员买饼子、梨、烟，在寒夜将自己的棉衣脱下给伤员盖。太谷赵康禄怕伤员小便中风，用自己的饭缸给他放在被窝里接尿。孝义苏作福怕冻着脚上的伤口，用自己的头巾给包起。伤员见流了一手巾的血，感动的说：“实在对不起。”他却回答：“这算甚？同志们流血都是为解放我们。”（后勤记者组）
