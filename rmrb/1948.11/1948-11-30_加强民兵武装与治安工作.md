The People's Armed Forces Department of the North China Military Region issued instructions to various localities last month, calling for the integration of militia organization rectification with Party consolidation and the conclusion of land reform, and for the serious conduct of winter training. At the beginning of this month, it also notified various localities of serious incidents in a few villages where militia organizations were manipulated and used by special agent bad elements, resulting in the shooting of our cadres and the masses, armed robbery, and the cutting and selling of power lines. It called on them to pay special attention to the purity of the quality of members when rectifying militia organizations, strengthen discipline, and strictly investigate and control weapons. This call should be given serious attention in all areas.

Of course, from the perspective of the entire North China Liberated Area, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Democratic Government, most areas have implemented land reform, and people of all strata have obtained the means of livelihood and production, creating a solid foundation for good social order and production construction. The aforementioned serious incidents are only individual and temporary. But this does not mean that we can rest easy or relax our militia armament and public security work in the Liberated Areas in the slightest, as some comrades think: "The revolution is about to be victorious, and armed work is no longer necessary." On the contrary, the closer the revolution gets to victory, the more the enemy will intensify its shameless sabotage activities, and the more the militia armament and public security work will need to be strengthened. Even after the victory of the revolution, the enemy's sabotage activities will still not stop quickly. If we disarm ourselves ideologically first, we will suffer a great loss. This is one aspect.

In addition, according to reports from correspondents in more than ten counties, including Yuanshi, Jingxing, and Puding, there are quite a few cases of gangsters and lawbreakers gathering to gamble, stealing crops and livestock, and even trafficking in drugs, which also affect the social order and production construction of the Liberated Areas. In order to eliminate this phenomenon, Taihang once explicitly ordered the restoration and establishment of security committees at all levels, and seriously investigated and punished certain principal culprits, which played a very good role. However, some places have not taken effective measures, allowing it to develop freely, or simply trying to rely on "education" to solve all problems, and in the end, they cannot solve it, forcing the masses to catch thieves and other people and beat them indiscriminately, causing even more chaos. There are also some local governments that simply use corporal punishment to extract confessions from thieves and others, restoring and developing the bad practices of the old yamen, which also fails to solve the problem thoroughly. These erroneous practices must be changed. Here we also offer the following suggestions for local reference.

First, seriously resolve the incidents that have already occurred, and through the resolution of these incidents, conduct extensive and in-depth education among cadres and the masses, so that everyone is alert and fights against illegal and destructive behavior in an organized and disciplined manner, supervises and transforms all hooligans, and severely punishes those with major cases in accordance with the law to enforce strict discipline. Those who steal due to economic difficulties, as long as they are determined to change, should be helped to solve their livelihood and production difficulties.

Second, in order to prevent the continued occurrence of this phenomenon, it is necessary to earnestly strengthen militia armament and public security work. On the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen the organizational structure of militia and public security work, and establish organized, planned, and disciplined investigation, interrogation work; on the other hand, it is necessary to conduct in-depth and specific education among village cadres and militiamen. Since the Party rectification, some comrades have developed a misconception that their past poor relations with the masses were because their work was "too responsible" and "too active," so now they have adopted a passive and irresponsible attitude, allowing phenomena that harm the interests of the people to exist and develop, which is completely wrong. They should be educated that opposing ordering the masses is not opposing leading the masses. On the contrary, it is to lead the masses more effectively and jointly fight against phenomena that are not conducive to the people. Strengthening militia armament and public security work should still be regarded as an important task at present.

### 加强民兵武装与治安工作

　　加强民兵武装与治安工作
    华北军区人民武装部上月份就指示各地，在整党与结束土改中结合整顿民兵组织，认真进行冬训；本月初又为少数村庄民兵组织被特务坏分子操纵利用，发生枪杀我干部、群众、武装抢劫、割卖电线等严重事件通报各地，号召在整顿民兵组织时特别注意队员质量纯洁，加强纪律，严格清查与掌握武器。这号召应该引起各地严重注意。
    当然，从整个华北解放区说来，在共产党与人民民主政府领导下，绝大部分地区实行了土地改革，各阶层人民都有了生活与生产资料，给良好的社会秩序与生产建设创造了巩固的基础，上述严重事件只是个别的、暂时的；但这并不是说我们可以高枕无忧，或丝毫放松解放区的民兵武装与治安工作，如象有些同志所想的：“革命快胜利了，武装工作可以不要了”；相反，革命越是接近胜利，敌人也将越发加紧其无耻的破坏活动，民兵武装与治安工作也就越发需要加强。即使在革命胜利之后，敌人的破坏活动也仍然不会很快就停止，如果我们自己首先在思想上解除了武装，那是要吃大亏的。这是一方面。
    另外，根据元氏、井陉、平定等十余县通讯员报导，流氓地痞与不法分子聚众赌博、偷窃庄稼牲畜，甚至贩卖毒品的事亦颇不少，同样影响着解放区的社会秩序与生产建设。为肃清此种现象，太行曾明令恢复与建立各级治安委员会，认真查缉与法办了某些首恶分子，起了很好的作用；但也有些地方并未采取有效措施，一任其自流发展，或想单纯依靠“教育”来解决一切问题，最后解决不了，逼得群众把小偷等抓来乱打，闹得更加混乱。也有的地方政府对小偷等单纯用肉刑逼供，恢复与发展着旧衙门的恶劣作风，也同样未能彻底解决问题。这些错误做法必须改变，我们在此并提出以下意见供各地参考。
    第一、认真解决已经发生的事件，并经过解决这些事件，在干部群众中进行广泛深入的教育，使大家警觉起来，有组织有纪律地对违法与破坏行为进行斗争，监督与改造一切流氓分子，对案情重大者，必须依法惩办，严明法纪。个别因生活困难而偷盗者，只要他们坚决转变，应帮助其解决生活与生产困难。
    第二、为防止此种现象的继续发生，必须认真加强民兵武装与治安工作。一方面要加强民兵与治安工作的组织机构，建立有组织、有计划、有纪律的查缉、审讯工作；一方面要在村干与民兵中进行深入的具体的教育，有些同志在整党以来发生一种错觉，以为自己过去和群众关系不好是因为自己工作“太负责”了，“太积极”了，于是现在就采取了消极不负责的态度，一任危害人民利益的现象存在与发展，这是完全错误的。应当教育他们：反对命令群众，并不是反对领导群众，相反的，是要更有效的领导群众，共同对不利于人民的现象做斗争，加强民兵武装与治安工作在目前还应该看成是一件重要工作。
