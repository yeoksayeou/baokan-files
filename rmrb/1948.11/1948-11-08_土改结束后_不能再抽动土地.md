　　No More Land Redistribution After Land Reform
　　Editor:
　　I am Shang Shiqing from Gaoyangzhuang Village, District One, Lingshou. My family has nine members and originally owned 5.1 mu of irrigated land. However, this year's severe flood destroyed 2.7 mu of irrigated land. Before the flood, the average irrigated land per person in our village was 0.9 mu, and after the flood, it was a little over 0.7 mu per person. However, my family's irrigated land averages only a little under 0.34 mu per person, which is not enough to sustain our lives. I discussed with the village cadres whether the land could be redistributed, but the village cadres said with difficulty, "The district has conveyed that no land can be moved anymore. Households with land destroyed by floods can reclaim滩 land or engage in side occupations and commerce. If there is really no other way, the higher authorities can also provide loans as a fund." If we follow what the district cadres said, what should the military dependents and families of martyrs who have no labor power do? My family has neither labor power nor people who know how to do side occupations and commerce, let alone reclaim滩 land... There are several households in the same situation as my family. What should be done?

　　Answer: If the land redistribution in your village has indeed been completed and the land reform has been declared over, and the district has also conveyed that no land can be moved anymore, you cannot request another redistribution because of the special circumstances of your family or a few families. Because the purpose of land reform and redistribution is only to eliminate the feudal system of exploitation and to distribute land to peasants with little or no land, in order to facilitate the development of production. After the completion of land reform, whether one becomes rich or falls into poverty depends entirely on whether one works diligently and frugally, and whether one uses the power of collective mutual assistance to carry out production. If one loses land due to disaster or some sudden attack and cannot make a living, the government should consider the situation and provide loans or relief. Your family's land was destroyed by the flood and you have no labor power, coupled with the difficulty of life, you can request the government to issue some loans and engage in some side occupations or industrial and commercial production yourself. Your family has nine people, if they are not all old, weak, sick, or disabled, as long as you have some funds and actively think of ways to produce, you probably won't be unable to find a way to make a living. If you hope to redistribute because the flood washed away your family's land, causing your family's average to be lower than others, and you emphasize the difficulties more, that is not right.

　　土改结束后
  　不能再抽动土地编辑同志：
    我是灵寿一区高阳庄村人，家有人九口，原有水地五亩一分，但今年水灾过重，冲毁水地二亩七分，按我村水地数在发水前每人平均九分，发水后每人平均七分余。而我家水地数每人只平均三点四分弱。不够维持生活，我与村干部谈土地是否能抽补，村干为难的说：“区里传达过，土地概不能动了，冲毁地的户，可开滩地或作副业及商业。如实在没办法的，上级也可贷给款作基金”。如果按区干部谈的那样办，无劳力的军干烈属应如何办？我家既无劳力，又无会作副业及商业的人，更不用说开滩地了………。象我家这样的情形不下数户，应该怎么办？

    答：你村的土地如确已抽补完毕，土改宣告结束，区上又传达过土地概不能动了，不能因为你一户或数户的特殊原因而要求再行抽补。因为土改及抽补的目的，只是为了消灭封建剥削制度，分给无地少地的农民以土地，以利发展生产。土改完成以后，发家致富或降为贫穷，全看自己是否勤俭劳动，及是否运用集体互助的力量来进行生产，如因灾荒或某种突然的袭击以至损失土地而无法生活，政府当酌量情形，予以贷款或救济。你家的地被水冲毁，又无劳力，加上生活困难，可以请求政府发些贷款，自己经营些副业或工商业生产。你家中有九口人，假如不都是老弱残废，只要有些基金，自己积极想办法生产，大概不至于找不到生活出路。假如你是因为大水冲了你家的地，以致你家的平均数比别人低了而希望再行抽补，而更多的强调困难，那是不应该的。
