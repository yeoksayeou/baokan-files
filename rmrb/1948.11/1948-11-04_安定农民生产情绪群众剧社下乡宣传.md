In the PingShan area, many farmers have anxieties about production after the land reform, and the phenomenon of eating, drinking, and not planning for the long term is still serious. Seeing the Fourth District Committee holding a meeting, some said: "Look, they're having another meeting! After the meeting, they'll come down and stir up land reform again?"

In response to this situation, our propaganda team quickly put together two one-act plays and several folk songs, and added a few old programs that were still suitable for the current needs, and organized a small propaganda team. We contacted the key villages in the county and district, and conducted a twenty-day tour in the second, third, and fourth districts.

Autumn Equinox is the busiest time for farmers. In order not to hinder farmers' production, we brought our own simple costumes and props and performed for three hours every night in the old village theater.

During and after each performance, the following reactions from the masses could be observed:

In the play "Five Dou of Wheat," the wife who eats and drinks extravagantly says: "Eating and drinking lavishly is 'right,' being thrifty and meticulous is 'wrong'!" This always provokes knowing laughter from the audience. When the new farmers' association cadre returns the lost five dou of wheat, the "old man" ridicules "wife" again, saying: "It's still you who is eating and drinking lavishly that is 'wrong,' and my being thrifty and meticulous is 'right'!" The audience laughs again, discussing: "Hey—in the end, the wife's thinking hasn't been straightened out!"

After the curtain closed on "Five Dou of Wheat" in Huobintai Village, there was much discussion. An old man wearing a thin cotton robe said to a middle-aged man: "Do you think this land reform won't be stirred up again?" "Maybe! They've even written a play about it! …This drama troupe is from above…."

In the play "Land Certificate," when the good-for-nothing doesn't receive a land certificate and is disappointed, the masses shout "Serves him right, serves him right, serves him right!" Xiang Dan, a thrifty and meticulous middle peasant in Bailou Village, said: "It's really right not to issue them land certificates!" "Whether you say it or not," said the new township head, an old party member, "the Communist Party always follows the right path!"

In Jingjiazhuang, in the morning, the masses holding rice bowls at the street corner gathered in a group to discuss last night's play:

"...It's all true and reasonable! Look at Wang Laoshuan (a good laboring middle peasant in 'Five Dou of Wheat'), he can't even eat the bowl of noodles he's holding, and he can't tell anyone about losing the wheat, see how difficult it is!" (said an old man over fifty)

"The father of ×× in Machong Village is just like this old man, he should be called to see this play!" (said a middle-aged woman)

"I told you long ago that land reform is complete, you didn't believe it, look, they've written a play about it!" (said a young cadre surnamed Jia)

Yang Jishi, a preferential treatment committee member in Xishe Village, said that one family member of a military person ran to him early the next morning after watching the play to ask for land! She said: "I wasn't clear in the past, but it's all explained in the play, the land won't be moved again in the future, and my land is not enough, I have to ask for more later!" (Some central villages in PingShan had issued land certificates, but in order to unify the North China style, they were taken back, and most of the new ones have not been issued yet. The masses still have concerns about land rights.)

A blind old woman in Tianxing Village grabbed the hand of one of our female comrades and said: "...People say the play is very 'right'! Don't leave, give us more propaganda! My daughter-in-law is also arguing about getting a divorce, eating well and dressing well but not working, people only say that the mother-in-law is stubborn, and I don't dare to say a word!..." (It turned out that her daughter-in-law was similar to the daughter-in-law in the play "Saving and Preparing for Famine"!)

"Zhang Erfa Carries a Stretcher" was performed in Xihuishe when the village was mobilizing stretchers. A squad leader said: "Some people just run away, they've forgotten their roots! (content of the song)"

Each performance achieved the desired effect, especially the two plays "Five Dou of Wheat" and "Issuing Land Certificates," which played a certain role in stabilizing the general mood of the masses. Of course, some of the masses are still hesitant, like, "Anyway, the policies of the democratic government are too flexible. Land reform will not be stirred up this autumn, but who will guarantee it in the future?" This is because our play's propaganda of the Party's fundamental policies is still very insufficient. At the same time, some side effects also occurred: because the actual situation in the village cannot be well compensated for a while, after watching the play, it aroused some dissatisfaction among the households who were wrongly struggled against in the past with the village (such as Daqi Village).

During each of our performances, available actors and staff members went offstage and mingled with the masses to listen to their reactions to each play. Before setting off the next day, we visited various families to understand the situation of the village and collect opinions on the performance. We constantly obtained many valuable opinions and constantly enriched and revised our scripts, roles, and folk songs.

For example, for "Land Certificate," the masses said: "Kageejijee Kageejijee! (clapper sound) How troublesome!" They didn't like the clapper, we didn't have time to fundamentally revise it, but based on opinions such as "Why is that old man unhappy?" "He keeps muttering endlessly…," we greatly reorganized and refined the script, and the masses were much calmer when watching this play!

For example, for "Saving and Preparing for Famine," the masses said: "This play is not over yet!..." So we added a "Daughter-in-law's Transformation Process," and the masses smiled with satisfaction after watching it!

For example, the actress who played the wife in "Five Dou of Wheat," in the first few performances, the audience said: "Look how fierce this wife is!" This was met with disapproval from the masses, but in the last few performances, they said: "This old lady is good!"

In terms of folk songs, the masses especially liked "Zhang Erfa" (storytelling style solo) and small things like "Three Spinning Songs."

While performing for the masses and singing for the masses, we also learned from the masses. Every comrade felt their artistic progress and further enhanced their enthusiasm for connecting with the masses. They all actively seized the time to understand the situation of the masses, explore their psychology, and listen to their reactions. As a result, the things we wanted to give to the masses were also constantly increasing!

### 安定农民生产情绪群众剧社下乡宣传

    安定农民生产情绪群众剧社下乡宣传
    在平山一带，群众在土改后的生产情绪上，存在着很多不安，大吃大喝不作长远打算的现象仍很严重。见四地委在开会，有的说：“看，又在开会哩！开完了又该下来闹土改了？”
    针对这种情况，我们宣传队即突击了两个独幕剧和几个歌子，又配上了几个还适合当前需要的旧节目，组织了一个小型宣传队。与县区接洽了各重点村，在二、三、四区进行了一个二十天的巡演。
    秋分，是最农忙的时期，为不妨害农民的生产，自己带着简便的服装与导具，每晚在村中旧戏楼上进行着三个钟头的演出。
    在每次的正演时与演出后，可见到群众有以下的反映：
    “五斗麦子”剧中，胡吃乱喝的老婆说到：“大吃大喝闹‘对’啦，俭省细密闹背啦！”总是惹起观众会心的哄笑。当新农会干部将丢了的五斗麦子送回，“老头”又讥笑“老婆”说：“还是你大吃大喝闹‘背’啦，我的俭省细密闹‘对’啦！”观众又是轰笑，议论着：“嗳——倒底还是老婆的思想没搞通！”
    霍宾台村演“五斗麦子”幕闭，纷纷议论，一个披着薄棉袍的老汉向一个中年人说：“你说这土地改革就不再闹啦？”“敢许！这都编出戏来啦！……人家这剧社是上边来的……。”
    “土地证”一剧演到二流子没领上土地证的败兴劲，群众中一片“该，该，该”声！白楼村的俭省细密的中农香旦说：“不发给他们土地证，这到底还是个正理！”“说不说吧，”老党员的新大乡长说“共产党多会也是朝着那正道走呢！”
    景家庄，早晨，街口上端着饭碗的群众，围了一团议论着昨晚的戏：
    “……都是实情实理呀！你看王老拴（五斗麦子中一个好劳动的中农）端着碗面条吃也吃不下，丢了麦子还是不能向人说，你看难不难！”（一个五十余岁的老汉说）
    “马仲村的××他爹就和这个老头一样样儿，该叫他来看看这戏了！”（一个中年妇女说）
    “说那，早给你们说土改完成了，你们不信，看这编出戏来了吧！”（是一个姓贾的青年干部说）
    西舍村的一个优抚委员杨吉时说，有一个干属，看戏的第二天一早就跑去向他要地！她说：“过去俺闹不清楚，这戏上都讲着呢，以后地不再动了，俺地还不够，赶后就要不上了！”（平山有些中心村曾发过土地证，为了华北式样的统一，又将这收回了，新的大部尚未发，群众对地权问题仍有顾虑）
    田兴村一个瞎眼老太婆，拉住我们的一个女同志的手说：“……人家说戏演的可‘得’呢！你们可别走，再给我们宣传宣传吧！俺家的媳妇也是争嚷着闹离婚，好吃好穿不干活，人净说当婆婆的顽固，我一句也不敢言！……”（原来她的媳妇正和“节约备荒”剧中的媳妇差不多！）
    “张二发抬担架”在西回舍演出时，正值该村动员担架，一个分队长说：“就是有偷跑的，都忘了本啦！（歌中内容）”
    每次的演出，都得到了预期的效果，尤其是“五斗麦子”和“发土地证”两剧，在一般的群众情绪上，起了一定的安定作用。当然也有的群众仍是犹疑着的，象“反正民主政府的政策过于活便，秋后土改是不闹了，以后谁又作准呢？”由于我们的剧内宣传党的根本政策还很不够。同时，还发生了一些副作用：由于村中实际情况不可能一时补偿的很好，看戏后，反引起一些错斗户对村中不满（如大齐村）。
    我们每次的演出，有空的演员和工作人员下台混到群众堆里去听取对每个戏的反映。次日出发之前，则到各家访问了解该村的情况和汇集对演出的意见。不断的得着很多宝贵的意见，不断的充实与修正着我们的剧本、角色和歌子。
    如“土地证”群众说：“咯唧唧咯唧唧！（快板声）麻烦的荒！”他们不欢喜快板，我们来不及根本修改，但根据“那老汉为什么不高兴呀？”“叨叨线线的叨个不完……”这些意见大大的整理与精炼了剧本，群众看这幕戏时就稳静得多了！
    如对“节约备荒”群众说：“这戏还没完哩！……”我们就加排了“媳妇的转变过程”，群众看后就满足的笑了！
    如演“五斗麦子”的老婆者，头几次演，观众说：“看这老婆厉害的！”遭到群众的不同情，而最后几次却说：“这老娘娘好！”
    歌子方面，群众对“张二发”说书型的独唱与“纺线三唱”等小型东西，特别欢喜。
    我们一面演给群众看，唱给群众听，又一面向群众学习，每个同志感到了自己艺术上的进展，更增进了联系群众的热情，都积极的抓取着时间去了解群众情况，探取群众的心理，听取他们的反映。因之我们所要给予群众的东西也不断的增多着！
