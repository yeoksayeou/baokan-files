Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 12th. Over three hundred employees of the Zhengzhou Postal Bureau remained at their posts when the city was liberated, protecting materials. Parcels and mail were not damaged in the slightest. After the People's Liberation Army entered the city, they selected representatives to contact our army and, under the guidance of the Military Control Commission, resumed postal services both inside and outside the city on the 29th of last month. Like the Zhengzhou railway workers, they demonstrated the consciousness of the Chinese working class. The Zhengzhou Military Control Commission has sent special personnel to express their appreciation to everyone for continuing to serve the people's postal cause, promising that they will continue to receive their original positions and salaries, and immediately allocated 100 jin of wheat per person to solve the current living difficulties of the employees. Under the guidance of the Military Control Commission, the Zhengzhou Temporary Postal Affairs Committee has been formed by fourteen employees elected by the staff, and is now actively organizing and promoting Zhengzhou's postal work.

　　郑州全体邮工留局保护资财恢复邮政
    【新华社郑州十二日电】郑州市邮政局三百余员工在该城解放时全体留局，保护资材，包裹、邮件等均未受到丝毫损失。解放军入城后，他们又选派代表自和我军取得联系，并在军管会的指导下，于上月二十九日即恢复了城内外的邮务工作。他们和郑州铁路工人同样，表现了中国工人阶级的觉悟。郑市军管会为此特派员前往慰勉大家继续为人民的邮政事业服务，按原职原薪照常供识，并即拨发每人麦子一百斤，以解决员工当前的生活困难。在军管会指导下，郑市临时邮务委员会已由员工选出十四人组成，现在积极整理与推进郑市的邮务工作。
