　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: In order to help farmers solve the difficulties of production materials and promote the great production movement next year, various liberated areas have strengthened the work of issuing agricultural loans, mainly in kind. In North China, the purpose is to make these loans truly beneficial to the development of agricultural production, to the benefit of farmers. The Jizhong District branches and sub-branches of the North China Bank and the production promotion cooperatives in various counties have lent out a large number of wheat seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural tools in September to help farmers plant wheat. This autumn loan has corrected the erroneous views of grace, relief, and purely looking at composition, which were caused by the unclear business policy in some areas in the past. Before the issuance, bank cadres, together with village cadres, discussed in detail the loan objects, interest rates, terms, procedures, etc., and after the initial determination, the bank cadres conducted further investigations to correct them before issuing. As a result of doing so, according to the statistics of twenty-five villages in six counties of Renqiu, Anping, etc., all farmers who actively produced and were truly in difficulty received loans. The Jiluyu Branch of the North China Bank has also allocated 3.05 million catties of wheat and 300 million Jilu banknotes, of which the majority will be used to purchase livestock in addition to solving the farmers' wheat seed difficulties. The Beiyue Administrative Office specially convened an agricultural loan conference to discuss the clearing and recovery of past agricultural loans and the issuance in the future. It was decided that the past grain loans should be recovered on schedule with principal and interest, except in special circumstances. For the issuance of agricultural loans in the future, it was decided to correct the past phenomena of using administrative orders to distribute, rush to issue, and egalitarianism. Except for short-term sporadic loans that can be given in cash, the rest will be converted into kind loans. This autumn and winter agricultural loans are determined to be mainly used for: 1. Repairing water conservancy projects, organizing and expanding waterwheel manufacturing plants. 2. Manufacturing handcarts, two-wheeled carts, and various agricultural tools. 3. Supporting oil mills and flour mills. 4. Supporting brick kilns and animal husbandry. In the Northeast, the Northeast Bank also decided that the physical loans issued this spring will be recovered in kind after autumn, except for individual areas severely affected by floods, as the basis for expanding issuance in various places next year. At the same time, it was decided that agricultural loans should be used centrally, specifically for building water conservancy, repairing canals and rivers, cultivating epidemic-resistant livestock, preventing insect pests, and improving seeds, which can give farmers greater benefits in production than sporadic loans. This autumn's agricultural loan issuance in East China, taking the Bohai Fourth Branch of the Beihai Bank as an example, first convened county and district cadre meetings or district loan officer and business officer meetings in various counties to convey and study policies and tasks to unify thinking and work pace, and determine the focus of issuance according to local conditions. Then, it went to the village to hold farmers' association or villager meetings to conduct propaganda, and at the same time conducted individual visits and investigations. Finally, after the self-reporting and public discussion at the farmers' association or villager meetings, the loans were truly given to farmers who lacked seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural tools. From September 5th to 25th, the bank had lent out more than 1 million catties of wheat seeds and more than 2.8 million catties of soybeans, which can increase the wheat planting area by more than 86,000 mu and the fertilization area by more than 93,000 mu. Among them, Lijin County mainly provides seed loans. Yangxin County mainly provides fertilizer loans. The bank reviewed that individual areas still have the following shortcomings in this autumn loan: 1. It violated the agricultural loan policy and put forward incorrect and one-sided slogans, such as "military dependents first, then poor and middle peasants" in Xintai District of Kenli County (newly established county, northeast of Lijin), and Zhanhua County proposed "poor hired laborers first, then new middle peasants, then general middle peasants, and appropriately take care of military martyrs' families." 2. Blind distribution without investigation and research failed to focus on solving the difficulties in the production of poor peasants. 3. Failure to pay attention to attracting farmers' private capital into production through autumn loans.

### 推动明年的大生产运动　各地加强农贷工作

　　推动明年的大生产运动
  　各地加强农贷工作
    【新华社陕北十二日电】为了帮助农民解决生产资料的困难，以推动明年的大生产运动，解放区各地都加强了以实物为主的发放农贷的工作。在华北，目的在于使这些贷款，真正有利于发展农业生产，以利于农民。华北银行冀中区各分、支行及各县生产推进社，已于九月份贷出大批麦种、肥料、农具，扶助农民播种小麦。这次秋贷纠正了过去某些地区曾因业务方针不明确所产生的恩赐、救济和单纯看成份等错误观点。在发放前，由银行干部会同村干部详细讨论贷款的对象、利息、期限、手续等，初步确定之后，再由银行干部进的调查，加以校正，始行发放。这样做的结果，据任邱、安平等六县二十五个村的统计，凡积极生产而真正有困难的农民，都得到了贷款。华北银行冀鲁豫区分行也已拨出麦子三百零五万斤，冀钞三亿元，其中除解决农民的麦种困难外，大部将用于购买牲口。北岳行署专门召集了一次农贷会议，讨论过去所发农贷的清理、收回及今后发放问题。决定过去的贷粮贷款，除特殊情况外，一律按期收回本利。对于今后发放农贷，决定纠正过去用行政命令分配、突击发放、平均主义等现象。除短期的零星借贷可给现款外，其余一律折实贷给。今年秋冬农贷，确定主要用于：一、与修水利，组织和扩大水车制造厂。二、制造手推车、二轮小车及各种农具。三、扶助油坊粉坊。四、扶助砖窑及牧畜业。在东北，东北银行也决定今春所发实物贷款，除个别水灾严重地区外，秋后一律按实物收回，作为明年各地扩大发放的基础。同时决定农贷集中使用，专用于兴办水利、修渠治河、培养疫畜、预防虫害、改良种籽等，这比零星贷款能给农民在生产上以更大的利益。华东今秋发放农贷，以北海银行渤海四分行为例，系首先在各县召开县区干部会议或各区贷款员及业务员会议，传达和研究政策与任务，以统一思想和工作步调，并根据各地情况，确定发放重点，然后到村召开农会或村民大会进行宣传，同时作个别访问与调查，最后经过农会或村民大会上的自报公议，使贷款真正落到缺种籽、缺肥料、缺农具的农民手中。自九月五日至二十五日，该行共已贷出麦种一百多万斤，大豆二百八十多万斤，可增加种麦面积八万六千余亩，施肥面积九万三千余亩。其中利津县主要为贷种。阳信县主要为贷肥。该行检讨这次秋贷中个别地区还存在如下缺点：一、违背了农贷方针，提出不正确的片面的口号，如垦利县（新设县，利津东北）新台区提出“先军工属，后贫中农”，沾化县提出“先贫雇后新中农，再一般的中农，适当地照顾军工烈属”。二、不调查研究即盲目分配，未能着重解决贫苦农民生产中的困难。三、未注意通过秋贷吸引农民私资投入生产。
