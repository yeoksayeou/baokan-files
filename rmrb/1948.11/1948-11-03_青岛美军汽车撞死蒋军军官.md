Xinhua News Agency, East China, 29th: Following the gang rape of Kuomintang military officers' wives and daughters by U.S. Air Force personnel in Hankou in early August, an incident occurred in Qingdao in early September in which a U.S. military vehicle killed a Kuomintang military officer. According to the Qingdao Minyan Daily, on the morning of September 7th, Song Zhesheng, a lieutenant colonel in the Kuomintang Army-Air Liaison Group, Chu Xingzhou, a lieutenant liaison officer at the Air Force Station, and Di Ziqi, a radio operator at the Naval Radio Station, accompanied by their girlfriends Ziguang and Zheng Junyan, were in a jeep heading to Cangkou Airport to see off a friend. On the way, they were chased and mocked by U.S. military personnel. On the return trip, they were closely pursued by a large U.S. military jeep. When the vehicle reached a turning point near the Sifang Airport at Fenghua Gate, the U.S. military vehicle suddenly rammed into it. The driver and all six passengers were thrown onto the railway tracks more than ten zhang (approximately 33 meters) away. Song Zhesheng and Ziguang were killed on the spot, and the other four were seriously injured. The U.S. military vehicle then drove away after causing the accident.

According to disclosures in Qingdao newspapers in September and October, the following cases of atrocities by U.S. military personnel also occurred: 1. On the night of October 5th, U.S. Marines broke into the Qingdao Public Newspaper, the official newspaper of the Kuomintang Qingdao Municipal Government, and destroyed the reception room. Zha Xingfan, the general affairs section chief of the newspaper, and Wang Bao, the messenger, were severely beaten. 2. On October 4th, a U.S. military truck struck down an eleven-year-old child, Fan Yudao, on Enxian Road, crushing his head and endangering his life. 3. On September 27th, U.S. military personnel at Huiquan Stadium beat a twelve-year-old candy-selling child, Li Baoqun, causing a head injury. 4. On the afternoon of September 7th, two U.S. military vehicle accidents occurred, injuring a businessman on Liaoning Road and two women on Taishan Road.
