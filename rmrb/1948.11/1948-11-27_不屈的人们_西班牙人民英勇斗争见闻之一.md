The rain gradually subsided. In the steel-gray sky, the clouds were dissipating. The sun, unseen for three days, shone brightly behind patches of cloud like a white-hot weapon. A gust of wind swept through the streets and alleys, and across the capital's markets, reminding the people of Madrid that summer was not yet over, and that a severe drought—the worst in years—was upon them.

"In any case, the market should be opening now," my maid said.

I knew she wanted to go to the market with some friends before dark. I told her to go ahead. When I said I was going to the Plaza Mayor too, she seemed very interested.

"But, sir, you should know that this is a common people's affair," she paused.

"We are all common people," I said.

"Perhaps in your country," she said.

"And in Spain?"

She suddenly cried.

"Beasts!" she murmured, "We treat each other like beasts."

She wept strangely. One rarely sees a Spaniard cry; the civil war seemed to have wrung most of the tears from them, just as the merciless African sun sucks the moisture from the Spanish soil. I spoke with her slowly, recalling the various hardships she had endured—her father was murdered for being the leader of the Republican Party in the village; her two brothers were tortured and then hanged for educating people to support land reform—and how difficult it was for her to have her current position as a maid!

However, I couldn't help but think that her crying was a good thing. No matter how much terrible horror and despair tormented her, as long as she could express herself with such explosive indignation, she had not been conquered. Although she was crying, my maid was still a typical figure among many Spanish people: they were waiting sadly and obediently, but deep down they harbored a seething fire.

………………………………

A few houses away, on Mora Street, I hailed a car. In this city, which was growing darker night after night due to the lack of electricity, Mora Street was one of the best-lit streets.

I got out and walked before reaching the Plaza Mayor, because the crowds were so dense that it was almost impossible for a car to pass.

The Plaza Mayor was lined with vendors selling sweets and small wooden monkeys. Men, women, and children—mostly from the poorer classes—filled the streets. Here and there, young couples cleared a small space and danced for a while to the music being played in front of the loudspeaker in the center of the square. Soon, the flow of people surged again.

I had not even completed one circle, and was watching with interest a beautiful doll made of thick cardboard, representing a peasant woman from the Canary Islands, when I suddenly felt someone touch my back. I turned around—which was not easy because of the crowd—and a small, sharp object was thrust into my right palm. My fingers instinctively grabbed it, but I couldn't see who had given it to me. I squeezed out of the square to see that it was a piece of paper, folded and folded, about the size of a small pebble.

I went to a secluded corner, held the paper in my left palm, and used the light from my cigarette lighter to look at it. Then I let my left hand, holding the newspaper, drop indifferently, until I was sure it was in my pocket.

I knew that any Spaniard found with such a newspaper by the Franco authorities would be shot immediately. Even for me, it could cause trouble—for example, the Franco government could demand that I be recalled. They had expelled Allied officials and employees from Franco's Spain for even smaller things... However, I still wanted to take a closer look at the newspaper. I had heard of such a newspaper, but this was the first time I had seen one.

I slowly walked back to the square, mingled with the crowd for a while, and after confirming that no one was following me, I hired a car and drove to the hotel where I was staying. I circled the entrance as if I were looking for someone. Then I turned into the side corridor, slipped out of the door of the chapel, quickly circled behind the hotel, passed through the Prado near the museum, and hired another car back to my residence.

At home, I carefully unfolded the newspaper and smoothed out the wrinkles. It was a tiny four-page newspaper, just four and a half inches wide and six inches long, exquisitely duplicated. I had never seen anything so small.

"The Reconquest of Spain," the title immediately brought to mind the ancient Spanish Reconquista army, which drove the armed Moors from the sacred land of Spain. For more than four hundred years, the Moors did not set foot on this territory again. Later, it was Franco who brought them in—first in 1934, when Franco was Chief of Staff. He brought Moors from Morocco to help suppress the uprising of the Asturian miners (in northern Spain, now the province of Oviedo); then in 1936, together with the Spanish Foreign Legion, they formed the vanguard of the "glorious uprising" against the Republic.

Now, the title "The Reconquest of Spain" immediately evoked not only the expulsion of the Moors, but also the downfall of Franco. Intertwined with this title was the exciting image of the ancient Asturian region, with its rugged ridges backing onto the cold Cantabrian Sea; that faced the warrior heart of Spain.

Asturia, with its towering peaks, gentle lingering clouds and vast open spaces, is sometimes called "the Wales of Spain."

In this mountainous region, in Covadonga, the Spanish Reconquista army launched a long and arduous struggle against the Moorish invaders a hundred years ago. The strongest of the guerrilla forces (mostly remnants of the Republican army in the civil war who never stopped fighting) continued to attack Franco's Moorish mercenaries and other various Franco armed forces from these mountain hideouts. With new determination, they fought to reconquer Spain from the invaders.

I had visited Asturia and seen evidence of the effectiveness of the guerrillas' activities. In the port city of Gijón, I drank cider with people whose lives were hanging by a thread. These people were responsible for receiving the guerrillas who came into the city from time to time, and taking care of their food and lodging.

The guerrillas came out to transport food and collect information from liaison personnel from the provincial capital of Oviedo, and even from Madrid. Sometimes they came to "settle accounts" with particularly hateful Falangist members.

All of this emerged in the title of this small newspaper that was secretly handed to me by someone unknown. The reason why this tiny "Reconquest of Spain" became the primary target of Franco's anger was not because of its poetic and powerful call for the heroic fighting spirit of Asturia that had never disappeared. Franco hated and feared this little publication because, within a few months of its publication, it became known as the bold mouthpiece of the most powerful and well-organized group in the Spanish underground, and it circulated throughout the country.

This group was the National Alliance, or the National Alliance Movement. It was led by an Executive Committee, headquartered in Madrid, and had nearly a thousand branches throughout Spain.

Franco had ordered the political police of the Ministry of the Interior, controlled by the Falange, military spies, and the Falange's own agents, to execute on the spot anyone who distributed "The Reconquest of Spain" or other publications of the National Alliance. However, as I later learned, the authorities found it very difficult to catch those who distributed the newspaper!

At this moment, I can't remember how I received the newspaper, how the distributor knew that I couldn't catch him, or what if I recognized him and handed him over to the nearby authorities as a "Red bandit"? Whoever it was, he or she seemed to be taking a great risk.

Three days later, at a cocktail party at the home of a Spanish doctor I knew, a neatly dressed young man, introduced as an importer, but whom I had discovered was a reliable member of the National Alliance organization, asked me:

"So, you liked the paper doll dressed in Canary Islands costume?"

I said, "Yes. I even persuaded the woman at the stall to sell it to me."

I stopped. By this time, they already knew who they had given a banned publication to. No wonder Franco was worried. These people really know how to work to minimize risks and maximize results.

In short, they knew what they wanted. Each issue of "The Reconquest of Spain" that they distributed indicated their main current objective. This was one of the newspapers that millions of Spanish people—who deeply hated the poverty, suffering, and despair that the Falangist state's inability to alleviate had paralyzed all progress in Spain—were bound to support since the death of the Republic in 1939.

(Translator's note: This article is an excerpt from the last chapter of the American writer Buli En's book "Wind in the Olive Groves." Based on what the author has heard and seen, the book describes Franco's extremely barbaric and terrifying fascist rule in Spain and the Spanish people's continuous and consistent heroic struggle. Under the strict news blockade of Franco and his reactionary supporters, this book revealed some things about Spain, so after the Russian translation was published in Moscow this spring, it immediately received favorable comments from Soviet critics and readers.)

　　不屈的人们
  　西班牙人民英勇斗争见闻之一
    布利恩  作  白光  译
    雨，渐渐地小了。钢灰色的空中，云块已在消散。三天不见的太阳，又在片片云垛背后，象白热的武器一样闪闪发光。一阵疾风吹过大街小巷，横扫过首都的市场，提醒马德里的人们说：夏天还没有过去，苦旱——几年来最严重的旱灾又来临了。
    “无论如何，现在总该开市了”，我的女仆说：
    我知道天黑之前，她要和一些朋友们到集上去。我告诉她先走好了。当我说我也要上布拉萨·梅耶的时候，她显得很有兴趣。
    “但是，先生得知道这是老百姓的事情”，她停住了。
    “我们都是老百姓”，我说。
    “在贵国也许是的”，她说。
    “在西班牙呢？”
    她突然哭了。
    “畜生！”她喃喃地说，“我们彼此都是以畜生相待”。
    她哭得很稀奇。人们很少看到西班牙人流泪，内战似乎已经绞干了大部分人的眼泪，犹如无情的菲洲炎日吸干了西班牙土地上的湿气。我慢慢地和她谈，回忆着她所遭遇的种种苦难——她的父亲因为曾经是本村的共和党首领被戮杀了；她两个兄弟，因为曾经教育人们拥护土地改革被严刑拷打，然后绞死了——而她能有目前作为一个女仆的境遇，又是何等不容易呵！
    然而，我不禁想到她的哭泣是好的。不管可怕的惊骇与绝望之感如何磨折着她，只要她还能以这种爆炸性的激愤表现她自己，她就还没有被征服。尽管她是流泪了，我的女仆还是许多西班牙人民当中的一个典型人物：他们是悲哀地、顺服地在等候，可是内心里却隐蔽着沸腾的热火。
    ………………………………
    在好几幢房屋以外的莫拉街地方，我唤到了一辆汽车。在这个由于电力欠缺，而一晚比一晚暗淡的城市里，莫拉街还是电灯设备最好的街道之一。
    到达布拉萨·梅耶之前，我就下来步行，因为人群熙熙壤壤，拥挤不堪，汽车几乎是不可能开过去的。
    布拉萨·梅耶，两旁排列着售卖糖果、小木头猴子的摊贩。男人、女人、儿童——大部分是较穷苦的阶层——充塞于途。这里，那里，年青的伴侣们誊出一小块地方，听着旷场中央播音机前面演凑出来的音乐，跳了一会儿舞，很快地、人的活流又泛滥起来了。
    我还没有兜完一圈，正在兴致盎然地观看小摊上装璜着的一个厚纸制成的、代表坎纳利农家女的一个美丽玩偶的时候，突然感到有人触动了我的背。我一转身——因为人群包围，转身很不容易——一个细小的、尖削的东西向我的右手掌塞进来，我的手指本能地抓住了，但是不能发见是谁给我的。我挤出了旷场，去看看原来是折了又折，只有小圆石子一般大小的一种纸头。
    我走到一个僻静的角落里，把那张纸握在左手掌中，在打着打火机吸烟的时候，借光把它看了一下。然后让握着报纸的左手漠然放下来，直到确定它已经是在我袋子里了。
    我知道，任何一个西班牙人，只要被佛朗哥当局查出一份这种报纸，就立即会被枪毙。即使对于我，也很可能招来麻烦——譬如，佛朗哥政府很可以要求把我召回去。他们曾经因为比这更小的事情，把盟国官员和雇员驱出佛朗哥西班牙。……然而，我还是要细看一下那张报纸。我曾经听说有这样一种报纸，但是，这是我所看到的第一份。
    我慢步回旷场去，在人群里混了一会儿，经考察确知没有人跟踪之后，才雇上一辆车子，驰往我居宿的旅馆。我在大门口盘绕了一圈，好象是在寻找什么人。然而转入侧面的走廊，从礼拜堂的门口溜出去，很快的在旅馆后面绕了一圈，穿过博物馆附近的布拉多，另外雇了一辆车回我的住宅。
    在家里，我仔细地展开这张报纸，把皱纹拭平。这是一张细小的四页报纸，比起来恰好有四寸半宽，六寸长，复写得精巧无比。其样式之小，是我前所未见的。
    “西班牙的光复”，这题目立即令人想起古代的西班牙光复军。这军队在西班牙神圣的土地上驱逐了武装的摩尔人。四百多年来，摩尔人再没有插足这片领土。以后是佛朗哥把他们引了来——第一次在一九三四年，那时候佛朗哥是参谋长。他把摩尔人从摩洛哥运来帮同镇压阿斯杜里安（在西班牙北部，即今奥维亚多省）矿工的起义；接着是在一九三六年，和西班牙外国军团一起，他们形成了对共和国“光荣起义”的先头部队。
    如今，“西班牙的光复”这题目，不但立即令人想起驱逐摩尔人，而且也立即令人想起佛朗哥的覆没。和这题目交织在一起的是古代奥斯杜里亚区域的令人兴奋的形象，它那背着寒冷的坎达布连海的起伏不平的山脊；那面向着西班牙的战士之心。
    奥斯杜里亚，它有高耸的山峰，温柔不散的云雾与庞大的旷场，有时候被称为“西班牙的威尔士”。
    在这山岳地区，在科瓦顿加，西班牙光复军于一百年前对摩尔人的侵略发动了长久的艰苦的斗争。最强大的一些游击队（大部分是内战中共和民军的残部，他们从未停止过战斗）也就是由这些山岳的隐蔽总部继续袭击佛朗哥雇佣的摩尔从仆及其他各种标记的佛朗哥武装力量。他们以新的坚决的战斗，从侵略者手中去光复西班牙。
    我曾经访问过奥斯杜利亚，看见了游击队活动成效的实证。在希洪港城，我曾经和一些生命朝不保夕的人们一起痛饮苹果酒。这些人负责接待不时进城来的游击队员，给他们料理膳宿等方面的事情。
    游击队员出来搬运粮食，向一些从省城奥维多，甚至从马德里来的联络人员收集情报。有时候，他们是来跟特别可憎的长枪会员“算帐”。
    这一切的一切，都在这张不知经由何许人的手里偷偷地递给我的小型报纸的题目上浮现出来了。这细小的一张“西班牙的光复”之成为佛朗哥愤怒的首要目标，并不是因为它对于奥斯杜利亚从没有消逝过的英雄战斗精神之富于诗意的、强有力的召唤。佛朗哥憎恨与恐惧这小小的出版物，是因为它出版之后没有几个月，就作为西班牙地下组织中最强大、组织最精巧的集团之大胆喉舌而闻名，并风行全国各地。
    这一集团就是全国联盟或全国联盟运动。它由一个执行委员会领导，总部设在马德里，有将近一千个支部遍布西班牙。
    佛朗哥曾经命令长枪会把持的内政部政治警察、军事间谍、长枪会自己的特务，要他们当场枪决所有散发“西班牙的光复”或全国联盟其他出版物的人。然而，以后我才知道，当局发见要捉拿散发报纸的人是谈何容易呀！
    此刻，我已经想不起我是怎样接到这张报纸的，散发报纸的人怎么会知道我不可能抓住他，倘若我认出他，把他作为“赤匪”交给临近的当局怎么办呢？不管是谁，他或她——似乎都是冒了很大的危险。
    三天以后，在我所认识的一个西班牙医生家的鸡尾酒晚会上，一个修饰净洁的年青人，介绍的时候说是入口商，但是，我已经发见他是全国联盟组织的一个可靠成员。这个人问我：
    “那么，你很喜欢那个卡纳利岛人装束的纸玩偶？”
    我说，“是的。我甚至劝说那摊上的女人把它卖给我。”
    我停住了。这时候，他们已经知道，他们把一份被禁的出版物交给了什么人。无怪佛朗哥要苦恼了。这些人真正懂得怎样进行工作才能冒最小的危险，而收最大的成效。
    总之，他们知道他们所要的是什么。他们所发行的每一期每一份“西班牙的光复”，都标明他们主要的当前对象。这是自从一九三九年共和国死亡以来，千千万万西班牙人民——他们对长枪会国家无能稍减使西班牙一切进展为之麻痹的贫困、苦痛与绝望感到深恶痛绝——必然拥护的报纸之一。
