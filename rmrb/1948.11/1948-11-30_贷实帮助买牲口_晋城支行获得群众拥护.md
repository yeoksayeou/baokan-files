　　Lending Actual Goods Helps Buy Livestock
　　Jincheng Branch Gains Popular Support from the Masses
　　[Taiyue Telegraph] This summer, the Jincheng County Branch of the North China Bank experimented with lending actual goods in Mengshan Village, Third District of the county, and it has now been successful and welcomed by the masses. After years of enemy and puppet rule and famine, Mengshan Village suffered great losses in labor, livestock, and farming tools. The village has more than 870 mu of land, but only 27 head of livestock (including six head increased through loans this spring). Based on this situation, the Jincheng Branch proposed a method of lending actual goods, while also considering the issue of preserving capital. After mass deliberation and discussion, the general public expressed their agreement. Some people said, "Lending grain and repaying grain, no one loses; regardless of whether the grain rises or falls, we borrow one shi and repay one shi." Someone said, "Last year, our village borrowed 900,000 [currency units], which could buy 45 shi of rice at the time, but now when we repay it, it can only buy 20 shi. If this continues for a few more years, the bank will lose everything, and we won't be able to borrow anymore." Someone also said, "Some people who take out loans spend the money recklessly, which is bad for everyone. If it's lending actual goods, no one will dare to borrow if they don't produce." Someone said, "This will restrain the lazy people. In the past, some people took out loans but didn't produce, only wanting to earn some easy money, but now they won't dare to borrow." However, a few people disagreed, saying, "We don't dare to borrow this. There's no limit to how high grain prices can rise. If they rise too much, we won't be able to repay, and we'll definitely suffer." But most people opposed this opinion. They all said, "If we borrow grain, we'll buy livestock with it, not spend it recklessly. If grain prices rise, livestock prices will also rise, so how can we suffer? Moreover, buying livestock will help with production, plowing the land well, which will yield more grain. In the winter, we can engage in transportation, and livestock can also accumulate manure, so how can we suffer any losses?" After everyone's debate, the majority agreed to lend actual goods. At that time, the Jincheng Branch lent out more than twelve shi of wheat in the village. Last month's inspection showed that the borrowed wheat had been combined with the farmers' own capital to buy back three mules, three donkeys, and two cattle. Loan recipient Jiao Shixian said, "If the bank hadn't lent me these three shi of wheat, I wouldn't have dared to buy a mule, let alone a cow." Jiao Shousheng said, "I am sincerely satisfied with buying this cow. Last year, the land was almost frozen in October and we hadn't planted wheat yet. This year, we finished planting by the ninth month (lunar calendar), and plowed it three times. Next year, I guarantee that each mu will yield three more dou." In addition to farming his own land, he also helped others farm a lot. Jiao Huoming planted wheat on 19 mu for others, earning more than 290 bundles of straw, worth more than 200,000 [currency units]. By the first of this month, all the loan recipients had voluntarily repaid their loans. This proves that lending actual goods can not only stimulate production and ensure the timely recovery of loans, but also actively correct the past relief-oriented views and achieve the goal of preserving capital.

　　贷实帮助买牲口
  　晋城支行获得群众拥护
    【太岳电】华北银行晋城县支行今夏在该县三区孟山村试验贷实，现已获得成功，得到群众欢迎。孟山村经过多年敌伪的统治掠夺与灾荒，劳畜力农具损失很大。全村八百七十多亩地，只有牲口廿七头（其中有今春贷款增加的六头）。晋城支行根据这个情况，即提出贷实办法，同时考虑了保本问题。经群众酝酿讨论，一般表示同意。有人说：“贷粮食还粮食，都不吃亏；不管粮食涨跌，咱借一石还一石。”有人说：“去年贷款，咱村贷了九十万，当时可买米四十五石，现在归还，只能买二十石。这样再过几年，银行就赔干了，咱们想再贷也贷不上了。”也有人说：“有些贷款的人把款胡花了，两头不合适。要是贷实，不生产就不敢贷了。”有人说：“这可把懒汉制住了。过去贷上款不生产，光想赚两个轻巧钱，这下叫他贷他也不敢贷了。”但也有少数人不同意，说：“这可不敢贷，粮食涨是没底的，涨的多了，还不起，非吃亏不行。”但多数人反对这意见。都说：“贷上粮食就买成了牲口，又不是胡花了。粮食涨，牲口也涨，这还能吃了亏？况且买上牲口还在生产，把地犁好，能多打粮食，冬天闲了能搞运输，牲口还能积粪，这有什么亏吃的？”经过大家争论，大多数同意了贷实。晋城支行当时就在该村贷出十二石多麦子。上月份检查，所贷麦子都结合了农民自己的本钱，买回骡三头，驴三头，牛两头。贷户焦士贤说：“不是银行贷给这三石麦子，不要说买骡，牛也不敢买。”焦守胜说：“我买上这头牛，真心满意足了。去年十月地快上冻还没种上麦，今年刚到九月（阴）就种完了，还犁了三遍，明年保证每亩能多打三斗。”他除了自种，还帮助别人也种了不少。焦或明给人种麦十九亩，赚谷草二百九十多捆，值洋二十多万元。各贷户至本月一日，都自动的把贷款归还了。这证明贷实不但能刺激生产，及时收回贷款，同时积极的纠正了过去的救济观点，达到了保本。
