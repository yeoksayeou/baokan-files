　  [Beiyue Electric] Militias in Man, Ding, Xu and other places in western Hebei, heroically launched landmine warfare against the Fu bandit troops who vainly attempted to sneak attack our Shijiazhuang. Eighty landmines were detonated, killing and wounding 73 enemies as has been verified. The military region's armed forces department and the district armed forces department have issued a commendation. On the morning of October 26th, two regiments of the 273rd Division of the 101st Army of the Baoding bandits (formerly the 33rd Provisional Division of the New 2nd Army) attacked the Dongxi Gou and Da Gudians areas of the sixth district of Mancheng, encountering resistance from the local militia joint defense. A total of 20 landmines were detonated, killing and wounding more than 20 enemies. Unable to withstand the resistance, the enemy fled in the afternoon. At the same time, the militia between Xushui and Rongcheng also detonated eight landmines; enemy casualties are pending investigation. Before the enemy troops occupied Dingxing County, the Dingxing militia had buried more than 100 mines in the city's large ditches, bridges, and on both sides of the railway station. It has now been verified that more than 20 mines exploded at the railway station, killing and wounding 23 enemies; more than 20 mines exploded in the city, killing and wounding more than 20 enemies; and five mines exploded at the bridges and ditches, with enemy casualties pending investigation. On October 28th, the militia of the fourth district of Xushui seized two rubber-wheeled carts from the enemy who was looting grain at Xijieying and routed the enemy. On the 26th, mines were also laid at the Caohe Bridge, and it has been verified that three mines exploded, killing more than 10 enemies. In addition to the commendation from the Beiyue Military Region and the District Armed Forces Department for this heroic fighting by the local militia, 200 rounds of ammunition were awarded to the militia of Dagudian, Duan Wangzhuang and other villages, hoping they would study more diligently, persevere, and complete the glorious task of blocking and delaying the enemy. It was also instructed that Ding and Xu counties should evaluate the meritorious militia in this operation for separate rewards, including silver shields, militia hero medals, etc.
   
    [Jizhong Electric] The People's Armed Forces Department of the Jizhong Military Region, specially issued a circular commending the participating cadres and militia in the border area of Qingyuan County. In mid-October, the local militia successively persisted in village defense and joint village defense in six villages including Baituan and Biyangcheng, winning four consecutive victories, smashing the continuous harassment of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Baoding, killing and wounding more than 200 bandits, and creating a brilliant record of one-to-one hundred. In order to encourage them to persevere and make persistent efforts, the military region decided to award each heroic participating cadre and militiaman a merit, and also award a machine gun, 20 rifles, and 1,000 rounds of ammunition. In addition, a letter was sent to encourage the participating cadres and militia, urging them to guard against arrogance and rashness, continue to carry forward the spirit of combat mutual assistance and resolutely defend the interests of the masses, be vigilant at all times, strengthen war preparedness, closely coordinate with the troops in combat, and strive for more victories.
