　　Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 20th: The glorious uprising of the Zhungeer Banner Security Division of the Yikezhao League under the leadership of Commander Qizhi Central has been warmly welcomed by all circles in Suiyuan and Mongolia. Yang Zhilin, Vice Chairman of the Suiyuan-Mongolia People's Government, and military and government leaders of the People's Liberation Army, recently sent representatives with letters of sympathy and a large number of慰劳品[translator please note this refers to items given as a reward for service and cannot be directly translated] to visit Commander Qizhi Central and his troops. The letter of sympathy praised Commander Qizhi Central and the officers and soldiers of the division for their righteous action of resolutely breaking away from the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gang and standing on the side of the people.
