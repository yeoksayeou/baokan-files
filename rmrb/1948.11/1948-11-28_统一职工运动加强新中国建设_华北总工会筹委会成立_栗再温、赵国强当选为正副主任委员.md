　　Unified Workers' Movement Strengthens New China's Construction
  　Establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions
    Li Zaiwen and Zhao Guoqiang Elected as Chairman and Vice-Chairman
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] With the rapid development of the nationwide victory situation and the imminent liberation of major cities such as Peiping, Tientsin, and Taiyuan, North China is about to fully enter the construction phase. At this unprecedentedly victorious great moment, and encouraged by the Sixth National Labor Congress, workers and laborers throughout North China urgently demand the unification of the North China workers' movement to accomplish the glorious task of New Democratic construction. The original Trade Union Federations of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei and Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Regions jointly convened an enlarged joint conference of the two regions' trade unions to establish a unified leadership organization for the North China labor movement—the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, and stipulated the tasks of the preparatory committee and the date of the first North China Workers' Representative Congress.
    The conference was held in Shijiazhuang from October 24th to 27th. Present were 29 representatives, including members of the Standing Committee of the two regions' trade union federations, as well as trade union representatives from Taihang, Taiyue, Southern Hebei, Northern Hebei, Central Hebei, Shijiazhuang, Jingxing, Yangquan, and other regions, and trade unions of North China public enterprises. Li Zaiwen and Zhao Guoqiang, Director and Deputy Director of the North China Government Labor Bureau, participated in and guided the conference in their dual capacities as worker representatives and government representatives. At the opening of the conference, Comrade Zhao Guoqiang presided and reported on the significance of the meeting, pointing out that the rapidly developing victorious situation and the great task of constructing North China require us to quickly unify the North China workers' movement to better support the front lines and develop industrial construction, continue to strengthen the proletariat, and end the reactionary rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries in China, as soon as possible. Comrade Mao Duo of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, speaking as a guest, used the example of Shijiazhuang after liberation to illustrate the importance of unified leadership and unified work pace in the workers' movement during the development of the situation. Trade union representatives from various regions spoke successively, all agreeing that it was timely to propose the unification of the North China workers' movement. Zhao Fei, the representative of the Jingxing Trade Union, said, "We have been looking forward to this day for a long time!" Li Yongshun and Ma Zhanbin, veteran workers of the "February 7th" Incident and representatives of the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan and Shijiazhuang-Dezhou Railways (who had attended three Labor Congresses), excitedly said, "It was not easy for us to hold this meeting. With the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have what we have today." They all expressed their sincere support for unifying the North China labor movement.
    After the speeches, the conference proceeded to discuss the election of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, deciding to conduct the election according to the following principles: (1) Preparatory committee members, except for those isolated in Chiang-occupied strongholds, must be trade union members. (2) Consideration should be given to all strategic areas and Chiang-occupied areas in the entire region, as well as major public enterprise departments, while also paying attention to female workers and young workers. (3) It was decided that the number of preparatory committee members would be determined by the conference proposing 31 candidates, with 21 executive committee members of the preparatory committee elected by secret ballot, and then 9 standing committee members elected by the executive committee.
    As a result of the election, Li Zaiwen, Zhao Guoqiang, Feng Suhai, Yuan Zhihe, Xu Ping, Hou Yutian, Liu Yongsheng, Hai Feng, Feng Wenbin, Cui Yun, Zhou Xifeng, Li Kaixin, Song Xingzhong, Gu Shouzhen, Li Xinde, Xi Jinxi, Liang Yongfu, Xiao Ming, Zhao Fei, Gao Zhi, and Ling Biying were elected as members of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions. Li Zaiwen, Zhao Guoqiang, Feng Suhai, Hou Yutian, Yuan Zhihe, Zhou Xifeng, Song Xingzhong, Xi Jinxi, and Cui Yun were elected as members of the Standing Committee. Li Zaiwen and Zhao Guoqiang were elected as Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Preparatory Committee.
    After listening to Comrade Li Zaiwen's report on the current situation and the current tasks of the workers' movement, the conference entered into a discussion of the date of the first North China Workers' Representative Congress and the method of electing representatives, deciding that the North China Workers' Representative Congress would be held in March of the following year, with the specific date and location to be determined by the Preparatory Committee.
    Finally, the conference passed a telegram paying respects to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and telegraphed the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the North China People's Government, congratulating the birth of the unified national labor movement leadership organ and the North China People's Government, and sincerely supporting their leadership.
