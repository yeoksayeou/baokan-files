Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 2nd. The era in which the people of Zhengzhou were long deceived and misled by the Kuomintang has come to an end. The day before the city's liberation (the 21st), the Kuomintang's 12th Pacification Zone Headquarters was still posting notices saying, "Zhengzhou can be secured." However, the People's Liberation Army entered Zhengzhou on the 22nd. On the same day, the Zhengzhou branch of the Xinhua News Agency began its work. On the 25th, the people's newspaper "Zhengzhou News" also met with the citizens, publishing the news of the recapture of Kaifeng, which was immediately snapped up. Citizens discussed with each other, "Kaifeng has been recovered, Zhengzhou is even more secure." Railway workers, hearing this news, became even more enthusiastic, actively repairing the railway in order to open it to traffic as soon as possible. The Zhengzhou citizens' desire to understand the various situations in the liberated areas is very urgent. On the 23rd, a cultural troupe from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army arrived in Zhengzhou, and at 4:00 PM they began holding a photo and book exhibition on Datong Road. By 10:00 PM, within six hours, over 2,000 people had visited. The most frequent request in the exhibition's opinion book was to move the exhibition to a larger venue. Some requested the rapid repair of the railway to Luoyang, and many students inquired about the address of the Central Plains University admissions office. After reading the heroic story of Wang Keqin's class, a combat hero of the People's Liberation Army, some people deeply regretted Wang Keqin's sacrifice. When People's Liberation Army personnel conducted street propaganda, the propaganda materials were in short supply, and some even paid money to buy them. The Central Plains Bank's banknotes were originally intended to be circulated in Zhengzhou three days after liberation, but on the second day after liberation, many shops and vendors automatically used them as the unit for calculating prices. They refused customers to buy goods with Chiang's currency, saying, "I don't want Chiang's currency, give me Central Plains notes. I've been to Luoyang and Yuzhou, I know Central Plains notes are reliable."

    郑州一片欢乐景象工人积极修复铁路
    【新华社郑州二日电】郑州人民长期遭受国民党蒙蔽欺骗的时代已告终结。该市解放前一日（二十一日）国民党十二绥区司令部还在贴布告说：“郑州可确保”，二十二日解放军便进入郑州。当日郑州新华分社即开始工作。二十五日人民报纸“郑州新闻”也和市民见面，登载了收复开封的消息，马上被抢购一空。市民互相谈论：“开封都收复了，郑州更有了保障。”铁路工人听到这个消息，情绪更加高涨，积极修复铁路，以便及早通车。郑州市民要求了解解放区各种情况的心情，非常迫切，二十三日解放军某部文工团到达郑州，下午四时即在大同路开始举行照片图书展览，到夜里十时止，六个钟头内参观者已达二千余人。展览室意见簿上最多的要求是把展览会改在大的地方举行。有的要求迅速修通至洛阳的铁路，许多学生询问中原大学招生处的地址。有人看了解放军战斗英雄王克勤班的英勇故事后，对王克勤的牺牲十分惋惜。解放军人员在进行街头宣传时，宣传品供不应求，甚至有人出钱向人购买。中州银行钞票原拟在郑州解放三日后开始流通，但在解放后第二天，许多商店和摊贩就自动以它作计算价格的单位了。他们拒绝顾客以蒋币购买货物，说：“不要蒋币，给我中州票吧，我到过洛阳、禹州，我知道中州票是保险的。”
