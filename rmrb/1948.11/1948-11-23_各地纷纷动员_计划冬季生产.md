Various Regions Mobilize, Plan Winter Production
  　Heshun: Spinning, Weaving, Transport, Manure Collection, and Firewood Gathering to Prepare for Expanded Production Next Year.
    [Taihang News] On November 3rd, Heshun County convened a village cadre meeting of over 600 people at three base points to study and launch winter production. The conference first explained the importance of winter production from three aspects: First, the war is approaching victory, and the task of supporting the front is significant; Second, this year's autumn harvest was not very good, and there are still some disaster-stricken villages; Third, it is to lay a solid foundation for next year's large-scale production and improve agricultural production by one inch next year. For this reason, it is necessary to exert all efforts to launch a winter production campaign.
    Secondly, explain the land reform and production policies to break down certain ideological barriers. Then, review the deviations in last winter's production. According to the different natural conditions of each village, the direction of winter production is determined: The general requirement in the county is to focus on spinning and weaving. According to different conditions in each district, the first and second districts mainly focus on the coal and iron industry, the third and fourth districts have many livestock and mainly focus on transportation, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts have a foundation in spinning and weaving and mainly focus on spinning and weaving. Rely on the mountains for a living. All industries and trades, such as oil mills (about 80 in the county), saltpeter workshops (about 60 in the county), mills, vinegar workshops, flour mills, shops, restaurants, and small-scale production groups and firewood gathering groups, have been planned by each village. In preparing for next year's large-scale production, everyone discussed the need to launch a campaign of manure collection, hemp stripping, coal carrying, and firewood gathering this winter. A cadre from Qilitan said: "Our seedlings are barren in winter, because we don't gather enough firewood in winter. When weeding the seedlings, we don't have firewood to burn. If we don't let the seedlings go barren, there is no other way."
    The issue of spinning and weaving was also specifically discussed. The current main problem is the self-flow of leadership. Secondly, the deviation of the one-sided poor and hired peasant line in many villages last winter has not been corrected, and disunity is still evident among middle and poor peasant women. Everyone felt that in order to do a good job in spinning and weaving, it is necessary to have the help of male cadres, the leadership of cooperatives, and overcome deviations to unite production across all strata.
    Regarding work arrangements, it was decided that from the 7th to the 17th would be the propaganda and preparation stage. The main task is to combine the publicity and the conclusion of the land reform policy to mobilize the masses' production enthusiasm. Go down to first focus on the masses to complete the autumn plowing, combined with repairing borders and accumulating manure. Women sew clothes, auxiliary labor strips hemp, buy cotton, and prepare to start spinning and weaving on the 18th.
    Wuxiang: Carrying Out Ideological Mobilization to Break Down Production Barriers
    [Taihang News] In order to launch winter production, Wuxiang County specially convened a mobilization meeting of over 300 county, district, and village cadres on the 4th of this month. First, Comrade Wang Ping of the County Party Committee gave an ideological mobilization speech, and in the afternoon, group discussions were held. In the process of deliberation and discussion, the following ideas were discovered: First, there is doubt about the policy, such as saying: When we engaged in campaigns in previous years, the higher-ups said it was the last time, but it ended up happening several more times. Second, taking poverty as an honor and not daring to get rich, Liang Zhong, chairman of the Baihe Cooperative, said: "My attitude towards production is just getting by. In my mind, I always feel that if I get rich, I will be struggled against. It is always glorious to be poor. If my class background is good, I can eat even if I don't move. If my class background is not good, it is not guaranteed even if I make trouble." Third, without determining land rights, people feel uneasy. After the end of land reform, most old middle peasants and others took out land, and borrowers returned land. Households who were wrongly struggled against were not motivated to produce. One household in Panlong, who borrowed five mu of land this spring, did not repair the border dikes or apply fertilizer, and only planted some beans, feeling that if he did well, he didn't know who it would belong to.
    After discovering these problems, County Chief Wang explained the spirit of the policy the next morning, and then put forward the tasks and requirements for winter production, explaining that the three major production tasks this winter are the coal industry, the saltpeter industry, and the textile industry. Every full male laborer must earn one shi of millet, every semi-male laborer must earn five dou of millet, and every spinning woman must earn at least ten jin of cotton, and semi-auxiliary laborers should do whatever they can. Many villages have formulated winter production plans based on their specific circumstances and natural conditions, such as Dahexi in the Fourth District and Nantai in the First District. Because they have no other production conditions, they plan to chisel slate and make stone covers. Each village puts forward different production priorities according to its own conditions, such as Fenshuiling, which opens shops and sells food because it is next to the main road. Gezhenzhuang is an oil mill, and most of the villages in the Seventh District are engaged in boiling saltpeter.
    In order to create experience and promote production, each district has determined the production base point villages, which directly reflect and report the situation to the county, and it is determined that this will happen every five days.
    Jingxing: Transportation and Work are the Main Focus, Combined with Various Side Occupations.
    [North Yue News] On the 6th of this month, Jingxing County convened a joint meeting of various production departments to study the issue of winter sideline production. Units such as the Credit Department, Supply and Marketing Department, Industry and Commerce Bureau, Stores, Shoe Factory, and Industrial Science Section participated. The Secretary of the County Party Committee and the Deputy County Chief presided over the meeting. The meeting discussed and determined the general policy of sideline production in the county, which is to focus on transportation and work (including kiln workers), combined with various picking and chopping activities. (1) Transportation (mainly coal, supplemented by mountain goods). Divided into two types of areas, one is the village next to the main road, requiring more than 80% of the livestock to be mobilized. The general requirement is that each livestock will earn 2.5 shi of rice this winter (three months). (2) Work. The fourth district is a mining area, requiring the mobilization of 7,800 workers (currently there are 6,000 people, including underground kiln workers and house construction workers). In the fifth, eighth, and ninth districts, there are 21 small kilns, and they can be further developed to increase workers. The general requirement is that each person will earn 3 shi of rice this winter in three months. (3) Various picking and chopping activities. In the mountainous area of the sixth district, mobilize the masses to cut firewood and branches, dig medicinal materials, and hunt around the mountains. Villages next to the main road mobilize the masses to carry goods for trade or set up stalls, such as Luozhuang's sesame cakes and Meixiu's steamed cakes. The second is women making shoe soles (for the shoe factory). A total of 19,000 pairs of shoe soles can be made in one month, with each pair earning 2.5 jin of rice. In addition, the porcelain industry in Nanhengkou in the fifth district, the lime kiln in Nanbeizhanglin, the sand basin in Liangwa, the lathe hammer in Sanjiadian, the water mill along the river, and the coal stalls along the road should also be restored as much as possible.

    Licheng: Advocating Relying on the Mountains for a Living and Formulating Specific Plans
    [Taihang News] In late October, all six districts in Licheng County successively convened hero and model worker conferences to summarize the year's production experience, select heroes and model workers, and mobilize for winter production work. Encouraged by the victory news, the heroes of each district exchanged a year's production experience and formulated winter production plans. The heroes of the fifth district formulated a plan to first clear up the remnants of autumn plowing when they returned. The heroes of the third district put forward slogans such as "Rely on the mountains for a living, rely on the roads for a living, walking is always better than sitting," and formulated specific winter production plans. The first district formulated a winter plan to accumulate 970,000 loads of manure this winter, striving to apply 29 loads of fertilizer per mu next year. 1,084 livestock will transport, earning 380,000 jin of rice. 144 workshops will earn 300,000 jin of rice. Other manual labor will earn more than 40,000 jin, for a total of 720,000 jin of rice this winter. The second district formulated a plan to prepare more than half a year's worth of firewood and charcoal for each household this winter to ensure that there is no shortage of burning fuel during spring plowing. In terms of textiles, each spinning woman should complete 3 jin of finished products per month; and the quality must be improved. The women in the fourth district proposed that this winter, no machine will be idle, and no one will be idle. Each person will complete an average of 4 jin of finished products per month, and strive to sell cloth in the coming spring instead of buying it. After exchanging experiences and formulating winter production plans, each district finally selected heroes and model workers. 683 people attended the meeting, and 103 heroes and model workers of grade A, such as Shi Cunjin and Fan Jinde, and 248 of grade B were selected.

　　各地纷纷动员　计划冬季生产
  　和顺　纺织运输集肥打柴　准备明年扩大生产
    【太行讯】和顺于十一月三号分三个基点召开了全县六百余人的村干部会议，研究开展冬季生产。大会首先从三个问题说明今冬生产的重要：第一是战争接近胜利，支前任务重大；第二是今年秋收不太好，还有一部分被灾村庄；第三是为了给明年大生产打下雄厚的基础，使明年农业生产提高一寸。为此必须发挥一切力量，开展冬季生产运动。
    其次说明土改与生产政策，打破某些思想障碍。接着检讨了去冬生产中的偏向。根据各村不同的自然条件，确定今冬生产方向：在全县普遍的要求是以纺织为主。各区根据不同条件，一二区是以煤铁业为主，三四区牲口多以开展运输为主，五六七区纺织上有基础主要是纺织。傍山吃山。各行各业生产，如油坊（全县约八十余座）、硝坊（全县约六十余座）、磨坊、醋坊、粉坊、店房、饭铺以及小型生产组拾砍组，各村都作了计划。在准备明年大生产上，大家讨论了今冬必须开展集肥、拆麻、担煤、打柴运动。七里滩干部说：“俺们那里冬天就荒了夏天的苗子，原因是冬天打不下柴，到锄苗时没柴烧，不荒苗就没办法”。
    关于纺织问题，也专门作了讨论。目前存在的问题主要是领导自流，其次是不少村去冬片面贫雇路线的偏向未纠正，中贫农妇女之间还表现了不团结。大家感觉到要想搞好纺织，必须有男干部的帮助，合作社的领导，克服偏向团结各阶层生产。
    关于工作按排，决定从七号到十七号为宣传准备阶段，主要工作是结合宣传结束土改政策，发动群众生产情绪。下去首先抓紧群众完成秋耕，结合修边积肥。妇女缝衣，辅劳力拆麻，购买棉花，准备纺织到十八号开始行动。
    武乡　进行思想动员　打破生产障碍
    【太行讯】为了开展冬季生产，武乡县特于本月四号，召开三百余人的县区村干部动员大会，首先由县委王平同志作思想动员，下午分组讨论，在酝酿讨论中，发现以下几种思想：一、对政策怀疑，如说：前年搞运动时，上级说是最后一次了，结果又搞了好几次。二、以穷为荣不敢发家，白和合作社主席梁中说：“我对生产就是圪能（应付），我思想上总觉得发了家挨斗，总是穷了光荣，成份好的不动也能吃的开，成份不好的闹下也不保险。”三、未确定地权情绪不安，大部老中农等结束土改往出拿土地，借地户等往出退，错斗户生产不起劲。蟠龙有一户今春借给他五亩地的他就没有修边堰也没有上粪，只是种了些豆子，觉得搞好还不知是谁的。
    发现这些问题后，第二天上午王县长说明了政策精神，接着提出今冬生产任务与要求，说明今冬的三大生产任务是煤业、硝业、纺织业，每个男全劳力要赚到小米一石，男半劳力要赚到小米五斗，每个纺妇要赚花十五斤至少要赚到十斤，半辅劳力能做啥做啥。不少村都根据本村具体情况及自然条件，订出了冬季生产计划，如四区大河西、一区南台，因无其他生产条件，他们计划凿石板做石盖。各村根据自己条件，提出不同的生产重点，如分水岭因傍大路是开店卖饭。圪针庄是油坊，七区各村大部是熬硝。
    为了创造经验推动生产，各区确定了生产基点村，直接给县反映与汇报情况，确定五天一次。
    井陉　运输做工为主　结合各种副业
    【北岳讯】本月六日，井陉县召开各生产部门联席会，研究今冬副业生产问题。计有信用部、供销部、工商局、商店、鞋厂、实业科等单位参加。县委书记和正副县长亲临主持。会议讨论确定全县副业的总方针，是以运输做工（包括窑工）为主，结合各种拾砍。（一）运输（以煤炭为主山货为副）。分两种地区，一种傍大路村庄，要求百分之八十以上牲口动起来。总的要求，每个牲口今冬（三月）挣米二石五斗。（二）做工。四区是矿区，要求其动员七千八百工，（现有六千来人，包括下窑工人和盖房工人）在五、八、九区现有小窑二十一座，还可再发展，增加工人，总的要求今冬三月每人挣米三石。（三）各种拾砍。在六区山地，发动群众割柴割条、刨药材，以及围山打猎等。傍大路村，发动群众担挑贸易或摆摊。如罗庄的烧饼，梅秀的卖糕。再次是妇女纳底子（给鞋厂）。共计一月能纳鞋底一万九千双，每双挣米二斤半。另外，五区南横口的磁业，南北张林的灰窑，梁洼的沙盆，三家店的旋棒锤，沿河的水磨，大道旁的煤栈等，也都尽量恢复。（刘永彬）
    黎城　提倡靠山吃山　具体制订计划
    【太行讯】黎城全县在十月底六个区都先后召开了英雄模范大会，总结全年生产经验，评选英雄模范，动员冬季生产工件。各区英雄都在胜利消息的鼓舞下，交流了一年的生产经验，订出了冬季生产计划。五区各英雄订出回去先扫清秋耕尾巴，三区提出：“靠山吃山，靠路吃路，走吃总比坐吃强”等口号，具体订出冬季生产计划。一区订出冬季计划，今冬要积肥九十七万驮，争取明年每亩上肥二十九驮。一千零八十四牲口运输，赚米三十八万斤。一百四十四座作坊米三十万斤。其他人力工四万余斤，共计今冬共可赚米七十二万斤。二区订出今冬每家准备半年以上柴炭，保证春耕中不缺烧燃。纺织上每个纺妇每月要完成三斤成品；在质量上要提高。四区妇女提出今冬是不闲一架机、一个人，每人平均一月完成四斤成品，争取明春不买布要卖布。各区经过交流经验订出冬季生产计划，最后评选英雄模范，到会六百八十三人，选出英雄模范，甲等石寸金、范进德等一百零三名，乙等二百四十八名。（联合办公室）
