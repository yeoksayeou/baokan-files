Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Around the time of Marshall's fleeting visit to Athens, the Greek Democratic Army launched a wide-ranging offensive across the country. This offensive has brought the royalist fascists' rule to the brink of collapse. In the north, in the Vitsi Triangle area of western Macedonia, after repelling the royalist fascists' invasion in mid-October, the Democratic Army launched a powerful counter-offensive, advancing westward, penetrating the enemy's rear, and occupying several important heights. On October 23rd, the Democratic Army launched another offensive, completely routing three enemy battalions, capturing thirty-seven light and heavy mortars and other weapons. During the battle, incidents occurred of fascist soldiers killing reactionary battalion commanders and joining the Democratic Army. The royalist fascist general staff admitted heavy losses and hastily reorganized its headquarters in the Vitsi area in an attempt to reverse its disastrous defeat. In the central region, Thessaly and the Pindus Mountains, the Democratic Army, after winning a major victory in the Grammos Mountains in the area this summer, is now also launching a wide-ranging offensive, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy and cutting off the strategic route between Larissa and Kozani, forcing the royalist fascists to supply these isolated cities by air. In the south, on the Peloponnese peninsula, the strength of the Democratic Army has grown particularly rapidly. According to a TASS report, during the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Greek issue in Paris, the royalist fascist representatives tried to conceal this, portraying the Democratic Army's main activities as limited to the northern border area, as an excuse for hiding their defeats. However, the Democratic Army's active offensive in the area shattered this conspiracy. Reactionary members of parliament from the Peloponnese peninsula held a meeting on October 20th, acknowledging the "perilous" situation and requesting reinforcements from the puppet Prime Minister Sophoulis. But Sophoulis replied that troops from the north could not be moved. He wanted the tattered royalist fascist forces on the Peloponnese peninsula to only defend cities and transportation centers.
　　In an order commemorating the second anniversary of the army's founding, General Markos, commander-in-chief of the Democratic Army, after summarizing the great victory of the Democratic Army in annihilating 120,000 enemy troops in the past two years, predicted that the enemy would be dealt an even heavier blow this winter. General Markos said: "The royalist fascists are now begging for more weapons and dollars to prepare for the 1949 campaign. We will never allow them to do so." The Athens puppet regime, terrified by the victorious prestige of the Democratic Army, announced the imposition of full martial law in its controlled areas at the end of October. According to a TASS report quoting the Detroit "Free Press," a conservative newspaper published in the United States, the leaders of the ruling clique in Athens are depositing most of their money in New York banks in preparation for fleeing Greece.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Radio Free Greece recently broadcast a description of life in the liberated Peloponnese peninsula, saying that large areas of the Peloponnese peninsula have been liberated by the Democratic Army, which has greatly alarmed the royalist fascists. The Democratic Army and the people are consolidating the foundations of democratic Greece in this area. The people have been given the opportunity for self-government, and 323 liberated villages have elected people's judges, and the people's courts have held six sessions. The first teachers' college has been established. On October 27th, village schools began classes. The people of the Peloponnese peninsula warmly support the Democratic Army. What has most discouraged the royalist fascists is that the Peloponnese peninsula is located in southern Greece, hundreds of kilometers from the northern border, which exposes the royalist fascists' lies about neighboring countries assisting the Democratic Army as completely unfounded.

　　希民主军广泛进攻
  　摩里亚半岛广大地区已解放
    雅典反动政府神魂不安实行全面戒严
    【新华社陕北六日电】在马歇尔忽忽访问雅典前后，希腊民主军在全国范围内展开广泛进攻，这一攻势已使保皇法西斯的统治陷于支离破碎之境。在北部，马其顿西部维齐三角地区，民主军于十月中旬击溃保皇法西斯的进犯之后举行强大反攻，大军向西挺进，渗入敌后，占领重要高地数。十月二十三日，民主军又发动攻势，彻底击溃敌三个营，缴获轻重臼炮三十七门及其他武器。作战中会发生法西斯军士兵杀死反动营长参加民主军的事件。保皇法西斯总参谋部承认损失重大，忽忙改组其在维齐地区的指挥部，以图挽回其惨败。在中部，色萨利地区及平都斯山区，民主军自今夏在该区的格拉姆斯山获得大胜后，现亦发动广泛进攻，使敌蒙受重大损失，并切断拉利萨和科萨纳之间的战略要道，迫使保皇法西斯不得不以飞机运输供应品给这些被隔绝了的城市。在南部，摩里亚半岛上，民主军力量的增涨特别迅速。据塔斯社报导，此次巴黎联合国大会讨论希腊问题时，保皇法西斯的代表对此力图掩盖，把民主军的主要活动，说只限于北部边境地区的样子，作为他们掩藏失利的借口，但民主军在该区的积极进攻，粉碎了这一阴谋。摩里亚半岛上反动的国会议员于十月二十日召开会议，承认形势“险恶”，并向伪总理索福利斯要求援军。但索福利斯的答复是：北部的军队无法调动。他要摩里亚半岛上的保皇法西斯的残破队伍只防守城市和交通中心。
    民主军总司令马科斯将军在纪念建军二周年的命令中，于总结民主军两年来歼敌十二万人的伟大胜利之后，预告今冬将予敌人更沉重的打击。马科斯将军说：“保皇法西斯分子现在正乞求更多武器和美元以准备一九四九年的作战。我们将决不允许他们这样做。”雅典小朝廷在民主军胜利声威震慑下，神魂不安，已于十月底宣布在其统治区内实行全面戒严。据塔斯社引美国底特律出版的保守报纸“自由报”消息，雅典统治集团中的头目纷纷把大部分金钱存到纽约各银行里，准备逃离希腊。
    【新华社陕北七日电】自由希腊电台顷在广播中描述解放后的摩里亚半岛的生活称，摩里亚半岛的广大地区已为民主军队所解放，这使得保皇法西斯分子大为惊慌。民主军及人民正在这一地区巩固民主希腊的基础。人民得到了自治的机会，三百二十三个解放了的乡村选出了人民的法官，人民法庭已开庭六次。第一所师范学校已设立起来。十月二十七日，乡村学校已开始上课。摩里亚半岛的人民热烈支援民主军。最使保皇法西斯分子丧气的事，是摩里亚半岛位于希腊的南部，远在北部国界数百公里以外，这暴露了保皇法西斯分子所散布的关于邻国援助民主军的谎言全属无稽。
