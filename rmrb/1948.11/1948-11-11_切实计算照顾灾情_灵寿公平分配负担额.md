　　Conscientiously Calculate and Consider Disaster Situation
  　Lingshou Fairly Distributes Burden Quota
    [Report from This Newspaper] In order to make the agricultural burden fair and reasonable, Lingshou County in the North Yue region has specifically determined methods for considering disaster situations. The county has experienced relatively widespread water and drought disasters; however, a few villages in the fourth district have wells for irrigation, and the fifth district has the Lingzheng Canal, so the harvests are still relatively good.
    Under these circumstances, truly understanding the situation and fairly distributing tasks are key to completing this year's collection. The county has decided to take disaster situations into account when determining the burden quota based on the severity and area of the disaster. The distribution method was discussed multiple times by the county committee and jointly discussed by responsible comrades from each district, and everyone agreed that it was fair. To be more cautious, it was not finalized but only treated as a preliminary plan.
    The method of considering the disaster situation: each district reduces the burden area (mu) rather than the burden quantity. For example, the third district determines the harvest yield for each disaster-stricken area. If it is a 50% yield, no consideration is given. If wheat was harvested in the summer with a 40% yield, and another 10% was harvested in the autumn, totaling a 50% yield, no consideration is given. If it is below a 40% yield, consideration is given accordingly. After deducting the total amount of disaster relief, it is then specifically distributed based on the total score and total number of households in the entire district. When Qinglian Village in the fourth district was considered, there was a distinction between the severity of the disaster. Cotton, sorghum, buckwheat, vegetables, etc., suffered less damage, while grain harvests were reduced. Therefore, the standard of 30% of the disaster was adopted, which was focused, and the masses approved. The method in the third district is: the martyrs', soldiers', workers', orphans', widows', and the disabled who have no ability to bear the burden can be appropriately assigned fewer military shoes, and others can be appropriately taken care of by the masses.
    Problems arising from considering the disaster situation and methods of resolution:
    During the investigation in Ciyu, there was no record of land where wheat had been harvested, and some disasters were not investigated clearly. After the list was announced, the masses were not satisfied. Later, a temporary representative meeting was convened, and each village temporarily elected people who were familiar with the geography and were fair and upright to collectively discuss and review the disaster situation with a focus, extensively promote democracy, concentrate everyone's opinions, make decisions, and distribute the burden to each household. When Qinglian Village in the second district proposed considering the disaster situation, there was no disaster, and they advocated bearing the burden equally according to the burden area, but the disaster-stricken households firmly disagreed. After research, the situation of considering the disaster was implemented to each household, explaining that considering the disaster does not mean that everyone is taken care of equally, and the masses all said it was reasonable.
    The following two points also need to be noted when considering the disaster situation:
    (1) The disaster situation investigation must be truthful. Without a truthful investigation, there can be no accurate calculation, which will lead to unfairness between households.
    (2) Listen to the masses' opinions and analyze them. For example, if someone says, "I can't afford it!" it is necessary to see if they are really in difficulty, or are they selfish, backward, and trying to pay less? The investigation should be clear and the calculation should be accurate.

### 切实计算照顾灾情　灵寿公平分配负担额

　　切实计算照顾灾情
  　灵寿公平分配负担额
    【本报讯】北岳灵寿县为使农业负担达到公平合理，特确定对灾情照顾办法。该县水旱灾情较为普遍；但四区有少数村庄有水井能浇，五区有灵正渠浇，所以年成还不错。
    在这种情况下，真实的了解情况，公平的分配任务，是完成今年征收的关键。县里按灾情的轻重及面积的大小，决定了照顾负担额。分配办法是经过县委会多次的讨论，经过各区负责同志共同讨论，大家都认为公平。为了更慎重，不作最后确定，只当作初步方案。
    照顾灾情的方法：各区都是减负担亩，不减负担量。例如三区是根据每块受灾地的不同，订为几成年景，如果是五成年景不照顾，如是夏季已收了麦子订四成年景，秋天又收一成总起来是五成年景就不照顾了。如是在四成年景以下，分别照顾；把灾情照顾总数扣除外，再按全区的总分数总户数具体分配。四区青廉村照顾时，有受灾轻重之分，棉花、高粱、荞麦、蔬菜等受灾较轻，谷物受灾减收，所以就采用了受灾十分之三为标准，这样有重点，群众赞成。三区作法是：没有负担力的烈、军、工及孤、寡、独等可适当少分配些军鞋，另是通过群众适当照顾。
    照顾灾情发生的问题及解决的方法：
    慈峪在调查时没闹出收了麦子的地，有的灾也未调查清，把榜公布后群众不满意。后便召开临时代表会，各闾临时选出地理熟悉、公平直正的人，集体讨论有重点的评议灾情，广泛发扬民主，集中了大家的意见，作出决定分配了各户负担。二区青廉村提出照顾灾情时，没有灾情，主张按负担亩平均负担，而受灾户坚决不同意。后经研究把照顾情形贯彻到户，说明照顾灾情，并不是一律照顾，群众都说合理。
    在照顾灾情时还需要注意下面两点：
    （一）灾情调查一定要真实，没有真实的调查，就不能有正确的计算，就会造成户与户不公平。
    （二）听取群众的反映，应进行分析，如有的说：“缴不起！”要看是真正有困难呢，还是自私、落后企图少拿点呢？应调查清楚，精确计算。
