　　Circular of the All-China Liberated Areas Youth Federation
    (November 5th)
    The great 13th anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement and the 3rd anniversary of the "December 1st" Movement are approaching! Students, both male and female, in all liberated areas: We are commemorating these two festivals amidst the high tide of the national revolution, the march of the People's Liberation Army towards national victory, and the thunderous cheers of the successive liberation of cities such as Jinan, Jinzhou, Changchun, Baotou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Shenyang, which has even greater significance.
    Since the "May Fourth" Movement, especially since "December 9th" and "December 1st," the new democratic social education system that students and youths across the country have been striving for has begun to be realized in the liberated areas. Revolutionary student masses in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are inheriting the glorious tradition of the "May Fourth" Movement and bravely resisting the persecution of Chiang Kai-shek and the United States.
    Youths in Greece, Spain, and Southeast Asian countries are bravely and unyieldingly fighting against imperialist aggression and the reactionary forces in their own countries.
    In order to commemorate the "December 9th" and "December 1st" anniversaries, we have decided on the following matters and hereby notify all localities:
    (1) Schools in all cities of the liberated areas should hold joint or separate conferences, lectures, symposiums, exhibitions, etc., to commemorate "December 9th" and "December 1st," pointing out the great significance of commemorating "December 9th" and "December 1st" in the current new situation. A call should be made to all students in the liberated areas to strengthen their studies in order to cultivate themselves into reserve forces for various constructions in the new democratic country, actively participate in various tasks in the People's Liberation War, and support the student movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.
    (2) Student federations in various parts of the liberated areas have often failed to hold meetings to discuss work on time recently, and some newly liberated areas have not yet established student federations. We propose that before the end of the year, organizations of provincial (or administrative region level) cities (cities equivalent to provinces) and student federations in various liberated areas must be established and improved. All students in secondary schools and above, with schools as units, should elect a certain number of representatives in proportion to the number of students, and those elected by the representative assembly should form the provincial (or administrative region level) city (cities equivalent to provinces) student federation. Any county with three or more secondary schools, or a city equivalent to a county, may establish a county or city student federation. Representatives selected from the provincial (or administrative region level) city (cities equivalent to provinces) student federation committees will attend the student representative conferences in various liberated areas to establish student federations in various liberated areas, and elect representatives (averaging one to two persons from each province or city, and one from each major university) to attend the National Liberated Areas Student Representative Conference to formally establish the All-China Liberated Areas Student Federation (the date is tentatively set for mid-February next year, and the location will be announced separately). Each liberated area will send one to two representatives to participate in the preparatory work for the National Liberated Areas Student Representative Conference (they must arrive at the location of this association before January 15th next year). The establishment or improvement of student federations in various liberated areas and provinces (cities) shall be the responsibility of the Youth Federation, Student Federation, or major schools in each liberated area, and should invite representatives from the same level of government education authorities and faculty members to participate in guidance.
    (3) We propose that student representative conferences at all levels should discuss and stipulate how students in various schools can help schools implement the new teaching policy; how to strengthen learning; how to organize extracurricular learning centered on school courses; how to unite teachers and students, unite students, and carry out mutual assistance; how to organize sports, health, and entertainment activities; how to participate in various mobilization works of the People's Liberation War; how to support the student movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas; and how to respond to the World Federation of Democratic Youth's call to aid the struggle of the youths in Greece and Spain, and should also support the youth movement in Southeast Asia.
    (4) In response to the call of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, publicize the heroic struggles of youths in Greece, Spain, and Southeast Asian countries to students, workers, peasants, and soldier youths in various gatherings, calling on everyone to stand up and support them, and write letters to express condolences. Letters and telegrams from various places can be forwarded by this association through the World Federation of Democratic Youth.
    (5) Please report the arrangement and execution process to us.
