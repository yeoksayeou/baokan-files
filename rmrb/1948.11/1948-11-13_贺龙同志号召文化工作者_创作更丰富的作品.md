Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 6th: Comrade He Long delivered a speech at the Jin Sui cultural circle's memorial meeting for the 12th anniversary of Lu Xun's death, calling on cultural workers in the Jin Sui liberated area to create richer works to meet the needs of the new victorious situation. He first pointed out that the cultural work in the Jin Sui liberated area had made great achievements during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year People's Revolutionary War. Then he pointed out the new tasks of the cultural front under the new revolutionary situation. Comrade He Long said: The People's Liberation Army is now winning great victories all over the country, and the Northwest People's Liberation Army is also fighting well. The "gun barrel" has demonstrated its power, and the "pen barrel" is required to demonstrate its power as well.

He said: An army without culture is a foolish army and cannot win battles. The People's Liberation Army can win battles precisely because it has cultural activities, which have improved the soldiers' political awareness, technology, and tactics. However, our troops' cultural level is still very low, and their spiritual food is very scarce. The front urgently needs newspapers and books; soldiers need to take cultural classes, watch plays, and sing songs. Cultural workers must meet these requirements, and our cultural work must serve the front.

When talking about how to unite and lead intellectuals in the new areas, Comrade He Long said: With the victory of the war, the liberated areas have expanded, and we have more big cities, factories, schools, and theaters. Everywhere is waiting for cultural workers to work. Intellectuals and artists in the new areas will have dozens or hundreds of questions to ask you. Only when you can satisfactorily answer their questions and meet their requirements, and unite and help them progress, and work well with them, can you be considered successful. Comrade He Long finally pointed out: After the complete victory of the revolutionary war, we will engage in new democratic economic and cultural construction throughout the country. At that time, we will need a richer cultural life. In order to shoulder this heavy burden, both now and in the future, we must make full preparations. We must now train a large number of cultural cadres; write more works for war, for production, for workers, peasants, and soldiers; run more newspapers and magazines that can be read by the masses and cadres; transform the old culture; and strengthen leadership and contact with rural drama troupes. Every cultural worker should strengthen theoretical study and improve their political level.

　　贺龙同志号召文化工作者
  　创作更丰富的作品
    【新华社晋绥六日电】贺龙同志在晋绥文化界纪念鲁迅逝世十二周年的会上发表讲话，号召晋绥解放区文化工作者，创作更丰富的作品，以应胜利新形势的需要。他首先指出晋绥解放区的文化工作在八年抗日战争和三年人民革命战争中，会有很大成绩。继之他指出了在新的革命形势下文化战线新的任务。贺龙同志说：人民解放军现在全国各地打大胜仗，西北人民解放军也打得很好。枪杆子已表现了力量，“枪杆子”要求我们的“笔杆子”也要表现力量。
    他说：没有文化的军队是愚蠢的军队，不可能打胜仗的。人民解放军正因为有文化活动，提高了战士的政治觉悟和技术、战术，所以才能打胜仗。但是，我们的部队文化水平还很低，精神食粮很缺乏。前方迫切要求报纸和书籍，战士要上文化课，要演戏，要唱歌。文化工作者必须满足这些要求，我们的文化工作必须为前线服务。
    在谈到如何团结与领导新区知识分子时，贺龙同志说：随着战争的胜利，解放区扩大了，我们有更多的大城市、工厂、学校、戏院，到处都在等待着文化工作者去工作，新区知识分子和艺人会有几十几百个问题问到你们身上，你们能满意答复他们的问题和要求，并会团结和帮助他们进步，与他们一道很好的工作，才能算是成功。贺龙同志最后指出：革命战争彻底胜利以后，我们就要在全国范围内从事新民主主义的经济和文化建设。那时，我们需要更丰富的文化生活。为了担负现在的和未来的这个重担子，我们必须作充分准备，现在就要培养大批文化干部；多写为战争、为生产、为工农兵的作品；办更多的使群众和干部能看的报纸和杂志；改造旧文化，并加强领导和联系农村剧团；每个文化工作的同志，应加强理论学习，提高自己的政治水平。
