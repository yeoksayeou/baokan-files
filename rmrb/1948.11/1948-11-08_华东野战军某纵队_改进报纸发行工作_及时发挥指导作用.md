Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 1st: A certain column of the East China Field Army has rectified the distribution and communication of newspapers in the troops and has achieved significant results. Currently, most units in the column can read the "Battlefield News," the column's official newspaper, on the same day. News稿件s sent out by the column can reach the Xinhua Branch within twenty-four hours, enabling the newspaper to play a guiding role in a timely manner.

In the past, the column's news transmission work was generally not valued. Receiving and sending personnel often thought it did not matter if they were delayed. Distribution and transmission were even slower during wartime and marches. After discovering these shortcomings, the headquarters and political department held a receiving and sending meeting to study improvement measures and issued a circular, specifically stipulating the following for receiving and sending work at all levels under different circumstances:

One, regarding newspaper distribution, strictly adhere to "people may stop, but newspapers don't." Before the newspapers are received, receiving and sending personnel at all levels should first order cavalrymen to investigate the route. If the regiment staff office receives the newspapers in the morning, they should be sent out before lunch. The camp secretaries should be instructed to send the newspapers to the company headquarters immediately via messengers if they are near the stationed location.

Two, news稿件s will now be sent through the staff organs. In case of movements, they will be sent up level by level with the daily camping reports. In case of rest and garrison, when cavalry messengers from staff organs at all levels send documents down, they should also go to the political organs to bring back news稿件s and deliver them level by level. In combat situations, they will be handed over to the staff office of the division and regiment forward headquarters for transmission. Important news稿件s, with the approval of the division and regiment political directors, may be sent by special cavalry to the column's political department for transfer to the Xinhua Branch.

Three, regular education is given to communication personnel at all levels on the concept of valuing the Party newspaper.

After the above measures were stipulated, the Propaganda Department of the column's political department notified the propaganda sections of each division and regiment and the branch reporters to assist in supervising the implementation. During the Jinan Campaign, many cavalry messengers of the column's various units rushed to deliver newspapers in the rain. The cavalry of the column's political department often delivered newspapers on time to troops stationed dozens of miles away every day in the rain and mud. Receiving and sending personnel and communication personnel at all levels have put forward the slogans "Strive for the troops to see the newspapers on the same day" and "Strive for the news稿件s to reach the branch within a day."

　　华东野战军某纵队
  　改进报纸发行工作
  　及时发挥指导作用
    【新华社华东前线一日电】华东野战军某纵队，整顿部队报纸发行及通讯传递工作，已获显著成绩。目前该部大多数单位能于当天看到纵队机关报“战地新闻”。该部所发出的通讯稿件能在二十四小时内到达新华支社，使报纸能及时发挥指导作用。过去该纵新闻传递工作，一般不被重视，收发人员常认为耽搁一下没关系，在战时和行军中发行传递工作更为迟缓。司令部、政治部发现了这些缺点后，特召开收发会议，研究改进办法；并发出通令，对不同情况下各级收发传递工作具体规定如下：一、对报纸发行，严格做到“人停报不停”，各级收发在报纸收到前，先令骑兵调查好路线，团参谋处如在上午收到报纸，即应在中午饭前送出，并责成各营书记在驻地较近的情况下，应即派通讯员转送各连部。二、通讯稿件今后经过参谋机关，在行动情况下，随各级宿营报告按级上送；在休整驻军情况下，各级参谋机关骑兵通讯员往下传送文件时，亦应到政治机关带回稿件，逐级递送。在作战情况下一律交师团前方指挥所参谋处传送。重要稿件已经师、团政治主任同意，得派专骑送纵队政治部转新华支社。三、对各级通讯人员经常进行重视党报观念的教育。上述办法规定后，纵队政治部宣传部并通知各师、团宣教科与支社记者协助督促执行，济南战役中，该纵队各部骑兵通讯员很多是冒雨急送，纵队政治部骑兵常在天雨泥泞中，每日按时给数十里外驻军传送报纸。各级收发和通讯人员，均提出了“为部队看到当天报纸而努力”、“为稿件一天到达支社而努力”的口号。
