　　Protecting the People's Cultural Property
  　North China Government Collects and Manages Cultural Relics and Historic Sites
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to collect and manage cultural relics and historic sites, the North China People's Government issued an order to its subordinate governments on the 13th of this month. The full text is as follows:
    Ancient cultural relics are our nation's cultural heritage. Many of them possess historical, academic, or artistic value. During land reform, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee both promulgated orders and measures based on the spirit of the Land Law Outline to protect and collect ancient cultural relics. According to recent months' understanding, this work has achieved certain results in various regions, but in-depth education has not yet been carried out among cadres and the masses. As a result, the loss and damage of books, antiques, and monuments are heard of from time to time. This is a major loss of the people's cultural property and should arouse serious attention. From now on, the management of books and antiques will be one of the regular cultural construction tasks. In order to carry out this work in an organized and planned manner, this government hereby re-establishes ten unified regulations. It is hoped that after receiving this order, you will convey and arrange it according to the specific situation in your area and submit a report.
    (1) Conduct in-depth education among cadres and the masses at all levels, explaining that such books and antiques are the historical heritage of Chinese culture and have great value for the new Chinese culture. Attention should be paid to their protection, and they should not be generally dismissed as "feudal superstition objects" and allowed to be damaged. Exporting them is strictly prohibited.
    (2) The Education Department of the North China People's Government, each administrative office area, each directly subordinate city, and each county shall establish a Book and Antique Management Committee at each level as a specialized agency for the management of books and antiques. Each Book and Antique Management Committee shall be composed of the education department of the government at each level and its corresponding propaganda and education departments, absorbing and employing local celebrities, experts, and cultural and educational workers. Specific measures shall be formulated and implemented according to local conditions.
    (3) All ancient stone tools, bronze tools and other metal tools, pottery, porcelain, jade, lacquerware, bamboo and woodware, teeth, bones, horns, shells, pearls, glass materials, leather goods, silk, hemp, cotton and other woven items and embroidery. All kinds of fossils, all ancient editions and various rare editions, unique editions, rare editions, manuscripts and uncommon books, steles, oracle bones, inscriptions and other rubbings, book plates, bamboo slips, archives, documents, account books, calligraphy and painting, Buddhist scriptures, etc., as well as modern Chinese and foreign books, instruments, newspapers, magazines, charts, etc., should be responsible for collection.
    (4) After the books and antiques are collected, they can be identified and registered separately in each administrative office area and directly subordinate city. The Book and Antique Management Committee of the Education Department will send people to inspect and decide whether to hand in or retain them according to the situation of the books and antiques in the area (those with specialized research value and precious antiques must be handed in). The part to be handed in will be transported to the Book and Antique Management Committee of the Education Department, and the part to be retained can be managed by the library established in each area, but a catalog must be sent to the Book and Antique Management Committee of the Education Department for file and reference in time, so that it can be transferred for research and reading when necessary. The Book and Antique Management Committee of the Education Department shall also compile and print the general catalog of books in the North China Book Museum and distribute it to various regions to meet the needs of everyone's reading.
    (5) All local places of interest and historical sites: such as famous temples and ancient temples and their affiliated buildings, underground buildings, ancient Buddha statues, steles, murals, ancient tombs and their affiliated buildings, ancient site excavation sites, former residences of celebrities, etc. that cannot be moved or are inconvenient to move can be kept in their original places and the local government is responsible for their protection.
    (6) Local people who donate their collection of antiques and books for public preservation, the local Book and Antique Management Committee may give appropriate rewards and care at its discretion, and in the land reform, the books and antiques confiscated from the landlords, whether distributed or not, should be handed over to the local Book and Antique Management Committee according to the spirit of the Land Law Outline, and cannot be distributed to the local masses as general property, but should be preserved by the state for all the people, but when the masses hand in the above books and antiques, they should also be given appropriate rewards.
    (7) Any staff member who uses his or her position to collect books and antiques for his or her own use shall immediately submit them to the local Book and Antique Management Committee after this instruction (if there is no Book and Antique Management Committee at the special district level, it shall be submitted to the Book and Antique Management Committee at the administrative office level). If the management institution has been established and they still fail to hand them over, they will be dealt with as stealing the fruits. Those who are responsible for collecting, protecting and promptly handing over the Book and Antique Management Committee shall be commended and rewarded, and those who arbitrarily damage books, antiques and monuments shall be given criticism or punishment according to the severity of the circumstances.
    (8) The catalog of books and the inventory of antiques submitted by various places should be detailed and specific. The main points of the report are listed as follows: Regarding books, the title of the book, the author (or editor, translator), the proofreader, the version (year of publication, place of publication, publisher, etc.), the binding collector, the appraiser, the height, width, number of volumes, number of pages, number of lines, the completeness and incompleteness, the source, the price, etc. should be found out. Regarding antiques, the following should be found out: the name, texture, size (height, length, width, diameter), color, pattern, weight, text, font, collector, completeness and incompleteness, source, price, etc. The precious antiques should be sent to the Book and Antique Management Committee of the Education Department as soon as possible by a special person. Regarding the monuments, the location, orientation, location, style, area, completeness and incompleteness, internal statues and buried objects (according to the main points of antiques), murals, steles, plaques, etc. should be found out.

After this instruction, no excavation shall be carried out without the approval of the Education Department.
    (10) The expenses for packing, transportation and storage, etc. incurred by various places for handing in books and antiques are allowed to be reimbursed.

　　保护人民文化财产
  　华北政府征集管理文物古迹
    【本报讯】为征集、管理文物古迹，华北人民政府，于本月十三日向所属各级政府发出训令，全文如下：
    古代文物为我民族文化遗产，其中不少具有历史学术或艺术价值，土改中为保护、征集古代文物，晋冀鲁豫边区政府及晋察冀边区行政委员会均曾根据土地法大纲精神颁布命令与办法。据近数月了解，此项工作在各地区均获得一定成绩，但仍未在干部群众中进行深入教育，因之各地图书古物古迹的散失损毁，时有所闻，此乃人民文化财产之重大损失，应引起严重注意。今后图书古物管理工作为经常的文化建设工作之一，本府为有组织有计划地进行此项工作，特再统一规定十条，望接令后根据你处具体情形传达布置，并作报告。
    （一）在各级干部群众中进行深入教育，说明此类图书古物是中华民族文化的历史遗产，对新中国文化具有重大价值，应加注意保护，不应一概斥为“封建迷信之物”任其损毁，应严禁出口。
    （二）华北人民政府教育部、各行署区、各直属市、各县，成立各级图书古物管理委员会，为图书古物管理的专门机关，各级图书古物管理委员会应以各级政府教育部门，及其同级各单位宣教部门吸收聘请地方知名人士专家、文化教育工作者组成之，根据各地情形拟具具体办法进行工作。
    （三）凡古代石器、铜器及其他金属器、陶器、瓷器、玉器、漆器、竹木器、齿牙骨角器、珠宝珧贝器、玻璃料器、皮革器、丝麻棉等编织物及刺绣。凡各种化石，凡古版及各种珍贵版本、孤本、绝本、抄本与不常习见之书籍、碑版、甲骨、金石文字及其他拓本、图书版片、简牍、档案、文书簿记、字画、佛经等以及近代的中外图书仪器报章杂志、图表等均应负责征集。
    （四）图书古物经征集后，在各行署区直属市，可分别鉴定登记，教育部图书古物管理委员会派人检视并根据该地图书古物的情况决定上缴或存留（有专门研究价值及珍贵古物必须上缴）。上缴部分运送到教育部图书古物管理委员会，存留部分可由各区成立图书馆负责管理工作，但须将目录清册按时造送教育部图书古物管理委员会存查，以备必要时调取研究阅览，教育部图书古物管理委员会亦得将华北图书博物馆图书编制总目录印发各区以供应大家阅览之需要。
    （五）凡各地名胜古迹：如名寺古刹及其附属建筑、地下建筑，古佛像、碑碣、壁画、古冢墓及其附属建筑、古迹发掘遗址，名人故居等不能移动及不便移动者可留原地保管，并责成当地政府负责保护。
    （六）凡地方人士捐献其所收藏之古物图书归公保存者，各地之图书古物管理委员会可酌情给予适当奖励与照顾，而在土改中，没收地主之图书古物不论分配与否，应按土地法大纲精神动员交给当地图书古物管理委员会，不能作为一般财产分配给当地群众，而由国家保存归全体人民所有，但在群众交献以上图书古物时，亦应给予适当奖励。
    （七）凡工作人员利用其职权收集图书古物据己有者，在这次指示之后应即刻送交当地图书古物管理委员会（专署级无图书古物管理委员会应交行署级图书古物管理委员会），如在管理机构已经成立而仍匿不交出者，即以窃取果实论处，对负责收集、爱护又能即时送交图书古物管理委员会者，应予表扬奖励，对任意使图书古物古迹损毁者，按情节轻重给予批评处分。
    （八）各地呈缴之图书目录与古物清册应详细具体，兹列举报告要点如下：关于图书者应查明书名，著者（或编者译者）校者版本（出版年、出版地、出版人等）装订收藏者鉴赏者，高广、册数、卷数、页数、函数、完缺情形、来源、价格等，关于古物者应查明：品名、质地、大小（高长宽、直径）、颜色、花纹、重量、文字、字体、收藏者、完缺情形、来源、价格等。古物中之珍贵者应派专人早日送交教育部图书古物管理委员会。关于古迹应查明：地点、方位、座落、样式、面积、完缺情形、内藏造像埋藏物（照古物要点）壁画、碑碣、匾额……等。
    （九）古物发掘不得自流进行，已发掘者要报告：缘起、过程、出土地质层、古物的位置，并按第八条所提古迹要点古物要点详细报告，此次指示后非经教育部批准不得自行发掘。
