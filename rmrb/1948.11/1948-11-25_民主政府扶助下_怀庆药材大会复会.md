　　【Taihang Telegram】The renowned Huaiqing (Qinyang) Pharmaceutical Materials Conference, which had been suspended for over a decade, was successfully reopened in October this year. Before the war, the conference was held annually and served as a nationally known exchange venue for Huai goods (medicinal materials, writing brushes, stone slabs, etc.) and medicinal materials from Sichuan, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. During the Japanese occupation, the conference was halted in 1937 due to transportation disruptions. This year, the democratic government, aiming to develop the economy, boost the market, facilitate the exchange of goods among liberated areas, and alleviate people's medical difficulties, decided to revive this regular conference, extending the original half-month duration to a full month. The conference site was moved from Liuyuan in the suburbs to Qinyang city. From the ninth day of the ninth lunar month to the eighteenth, Huai medicinal material transactions reached 25,197 jin in half a month, while medicinal materials transported from Sichuan, Guangdong, and other regions amounted to over 10,000 jin. Grain transactions exceeded 1,000 shi; over 500 head of livestock were brought to market, with 61 head sold. Other general merchandise, such as Luzhou liquor and edible salt, also gathered in large quantities. The north-south exchange of Sichuan and Guizhou medicinal materials, which had been difficult to obtain for a decade, was once again achieved. Merchants from Luoyang and Yuzhou south of the Yellow River, and from Jincheng, Changzhi, Handan, Linqing, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Nangong, and Jizhou north of the Yellow River, also rushed to purchase wholesale. Many merchants from Tianjin and Xi'an in the Kuomintang-controlled areas also traveled long distances to attend. They expressed great excitement about the trade freedom in the liberated areas. A merchant from Xi'an said, "Doing business over there (in the Kuomintang area) is suffocating. With inspections here and confiscations there, it's impossible to work properly. Coming to the liberated areas, seeing that every common person is peacefully engaged in production and developing industry and commerce, it's truly like two different worlds compared to over there. When will the People's Liberation Army be able to go over there and let us live comfortably for a couple of days too?" The conference has played a significant role in promoting industrial and commercial development.

　　民主政府扶助下
  　怀庆药材大会复会
    【太行电】停隔十数年的著名的怀庆（沁阳）药材大会，今年十月间又首次复会，颇为繁盛，该会在战前年年照例举行，是怀货（药材、笔墨、石板等）和川、广、云、贵诸省闻名于全国的药材交换场所。日寇占领时期，因交通隔绝，大会从一九三七年就停止了。今年民主政府为了发展经济，繁荣市场，沟通各解放区的物资，并解除人民医药上的困难，决定恢复这个例会。并将原来半个月的会期延长为一个月。会址由偻址柳园移至沁阳城里。从阴历九月九日开始，到十八日止，半个月中怀药成交已达两万五千一百九十七斤，川广等地运来药材成交一万余斤；粮食成交一千余石；牲口上市五百余头，成交六十一头，其他潞酒、食盐等百货云集。十年来难能获得的川、贵药材，此次又达到了南北的交流。黄河以南的洛阳、禹州以北的晋城、长治、邯郸、临清、邢台、石家庄、南宫、冀州等地客商也赶来收购批发，国民党统治区天津、西安的商人很多也都远道赶来，他们对解放区的贸易自由感到异常兴奋，西安的商人说：“我们在那边（指国民党区）作生意，活活把人困死，这样货检查，那样货也没收，总不能好好干；来到解放区，看见个个老百姓安心生产，发展工商业，和那边比起来真是两个世界。啥时候解放军也能过去，让我们也痛痛快快活两天呢？”该会对发展工商业起了很大推动作用。
