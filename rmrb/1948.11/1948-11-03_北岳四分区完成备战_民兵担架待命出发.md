The Party, government, civilian, and military organs of the military district have decided to organize × joint front and rear headquarters to lead the counties in carrying out war preparations under the unified leadership of the District Party Committee. Counties are beginning inter-county defense efforts, districts inter-district, and villages inter-village, fortifying walls and clearing the fields, destroying transportation arteries along the lines, building fortifications, organizing various reconnaissance organizations to scout enemy positions, mobilizing all militia and demolition squads to prepare for guerrilla warfare and mine warfare. They are also preparing strong militia companies, stretcher teams, pack mule teams, and large quantities of grain, oil, salt and other supplies to support the main force in front-line operations, and are treating the current tax collection work as one of the important tasks of war preparation. The District Party Committee and most of the cadres of various organs have now been divided into groups to go to various counties to inspect and promote comprehensive war preparations. At present, the command organizations for war preparation in Zhengding, Quyang, Xingtang, and Lingshou counties have been established, and militia teams and demolition groups are ready to enter combat at any time. Minefields are being widely laid. Militia companies, stretcher teams, and pack mule teams are fully prepared and ready to assemble completely within one day after the higher authorities issue a concentration order; preliminary road destruction and fortification work has also been completed. Militia sentry posts have been established in Quyang, Xingtang, Lingshou, Zhengding and other counties, and martial law has been implemented. The masses are rushing to process and deliver public grain, and Lingshou Fifth District collected more than 110,000 catties of public grain in one day.
