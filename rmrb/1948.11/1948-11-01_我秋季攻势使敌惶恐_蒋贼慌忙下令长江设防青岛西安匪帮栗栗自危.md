Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. According to reports from various sources: Amidst the frequent victories of the People's Liberation Army on various battlefields, the bandit Chiang Kai-shek, while rushing to Beiping to direct increasingly disastrous military operations, also worried about the safety of his rear bandit lairs, hurriedly ordering the defense of the Yangtze River. According to a United Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 22nd, citing "reliable sources," Chiang Kai-shek issued this order from his temporary headquarters in Beiping via radio, stipulating that the line from Hankou to the mouth of the Yangtze River be divided into nine defense sections, each patrolled day and night by eight warships and several motorboats. Kuomintang troops "are now deploying strategic strongholds from Suzhou to Wuchang." As for Nanjing, the heart of the Kuomintang, "a series of new bunkers and obstacles have been set up inside and outside the city."

Other cities still in the hands of the Kuomintang are in the same state of panic. After the liberation of Jinan, the Kuomintang bandit gangs entrenched in Qingdao are trembling in fear, unable to find peace for a single day. The enemy's 11th Pacification Headquarters sent out large numbers of secret agents, strictly forbidding citizens from discussing the Jinan battle, and ordering the implementation of "five-household mutual guarantee, with sworn pledges," conducting a thorough household registration check, and setting a deadline to conscript 20,000 able-bodied men. Li Daifang, speaker of the Qingdao puppet参议会, exclaimed: "When the lips are gone, the teeth are cold. Changwei and Jinan are lessons for Qingdao." After the People's Liberation Army's great victory in Lubei, the Chiang-Hu bandit gangs in Xi'an became increasingly panicked. Xicangmen, where Hu's private residence is located, is under curfew every afternoon, prohibiting pedestrians. The enemy's Pacification Headquarters in Xiaoyanta in the southern suburbs of the city is preparing to move to the new city. An airfield is being expanded east of the new city, and three gun towers are being added to the airfield outside the four gates. In the old city within the new city, civilian houses are being prepared for demolition to build an airfield. Xi'an is full of foxholes prepared for street fighting. In Lintong and Xianyang, satellites of Xi'an, the Kuomintang is forcing laborers and workers on the Longhai Railway to rush to build fortifications. Given the PLA's repeated victories in attacking fortified positions, the laborers building the fortifications whispered, "The Yellow River couldn't stop the PLA, what good will digging these trenches do?"

Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi Central Front, 29th. In the Lubei campaign, the Northwest Liberation Army captured a letter from Cao Weihan, commander of the enemy's 55th Brigade of the 38th Division, which had not yet been sent. The letter reflected the panic and despair of high-ranking Kuomintang military officers in the face of the PLA's powerful autumn offensive, and their complete loss of confidence in defending the city. The letter was written by Cao Weihan to Cao Rihui, the enemy's Xi'an Garrison Commander, at Lijiayuan, Lubei, on September 27th, to "No. 42, Shuangren Mansion, Chang'an." In the letter, Cao Weihan mentioned the news that our army had captured Jinan, that Wang Yaowu and the 100,000-strong garrison had been wiped out, and that our army in the Northeast and North China had launched a powerful autumn offensive. He then said, "Xi'an is also approaching a time for preparation!" and asked Cao Rihui to "make plans in advance." In the letter, Cao Weihan expressed great fear of our army's superior command of city attacks, the tight organization of firepower, and the surging morale. He said: The Liberation Army "adopts the strategy of besieging the city without leaving any gaps, and catching everything in one net. It uses a sea of fire to cover a sea of men (note: 'sea of fire' and 'sea of men' are terms used by the frightened enemy to describe our army's fierce artillery fire and surging offensive spirit), rushing in with a single blow, pushing the boat along the current, making it impossible to block." "Fifteen years ago, 'suppressing bandits' meant using a bunker policy, but against today's bandit sea of fire and sea of men, the city wall is a coffin and the bunker is a grave." "It will inevitably lead to exhaustion, either being beaten to death or trapped to death. What's in the bag will never survive."

    我秋季攻势使敌惶恐
    蒋贼慌忙下令长江设防青岛西安匪帮栗栗自危
    【新华社陕北三十日电】据各方报导：在人民解放军各战场捷报频传之际，蒋匪介石一面仓皇飞到北平指挥越来越糟的军事，一面又担忧其后方匪窝的安全，慌忙下令在长江设防。据合众社南京二十二日电引“可靠方面”消息报导，蒋介石在北平临时总部以无线电发出的这一命令，规定汉口至长江入海处一线划为九个防御段，每段以八艘军舰及若干汽艇昼夜巡逻。国民党军队“现正部署从苏州到武昌各战略据点”。作为国民党心脏的南京，“城内外已设置了一连串的新地堡和障碍物。”
    还在国民党手里的其他城市，也是一样的恐慌万状。济南解放后，困踞青岛一隅的国民党匪帮栗栗自危，不可终日。敌十一绥靖公署派出大批特务，严禁市民谈论济南战事，并下令施行“五户联坐、具保切结”，举行户口大清查，限期赶抓壮丁二万。青岛伪参议会议长李代芳惊呼：“唇亡齿寒、昌、潍、济南就是青岛的前军之鉴。”人民解放军荔北大捷后，西安蒋胡匪帮日益恐慌。胡匪私邸所在地的西仓门，每天下午即戒严禁止行人。城南郊小雁塔敌绥署准备搬入新城。新城东边增修城内飞机场；并在四关外的飞机场增修三座炮塔。新城以内的旧城亦准备拆去民房，修筑机场。西安城内满布准备巷战用的伏地堡。作为西安卫星的临潼、咸阳等地，国民党更强迫民夫及陇海铁路工人，赶修防御工事。鉴于人民解放军历次攻坚胜利的事实，修工事的民夫窃窃私语说：“黄河都挡不住解放军，修下这壕能挡个啥！”
    【新华社陕中前线二十九日电】西北解放军于荔北战役中，缴获了敌整三十八师五十五旅旅长曹维汉的一封尚未发出的信。信中反映了国民党军高级军官在解放军强大秋季攻势面前的惶恐、绝望，和对守城完全丧失信心。该信是曹维汉于九月二十七日在荔北李家塬，写给“长安双仁府四十二号”敌西安警备司令曹日晖的。曹维汉在信中说到了我军攻克济南，王耀武以下守军十万全被消灭，东北、华北我军都展开了强大秋季攻势的消息，接着说，“西安亦已临未雨之时刻矣！”要曹日晖“预作筹谋”。曹维汉在信中对我军攻城指挥的优越，火力组织的严密，士气的旺盛表现了极大的恐惧。他说：解放军“对据点城寨之攻击，概采围城不缺，一网打尽之方针，以火海掩护人海（按‘火海’、‘人海’是恐惧的敌人用以描写我军炮火猛烈与攻击精神旺盛的名词），一鼓突入，顺手推舟，欲堵莫及。”“十五年以前‘剿匪’是利用碉堡政策，以之对今日匪之火海人海，则城墙是棺材，碉堡是坟墓。”“必致势穷力竭，非打死即困死，囊中之物，决无幸存之理。”
