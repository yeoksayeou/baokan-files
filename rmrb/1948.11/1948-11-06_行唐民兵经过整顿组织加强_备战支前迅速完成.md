　　Xingtang Militia Reorganized and Strengthened
  　Rapid Completion of War Preparation and Frontline Support
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Xingtang militia, who fought against the Japanese invaders and puppet troops during the War of Resistance, have stood firm again in the recent emergency mobilization for war preparation and frontline support to defend the Baoding-Shijiazhuang line, and have quickly completed the emergency war preparation and frontline support tasks assigned by higher authorities. When the higher authorities issued an emergency mobilization order on the 27th of last month, specifying the specific tasks of the Xingtang militia in disrupting communications, the Xingtang County Party Committee and the County Armed Forces Department immediately issued an emergency order, mobilizing the militia of villages near Xingtang City to assemble urgently in preparation for disrupting communications. Within one night, more than 4,000 militiamen were concentrated and awaiting orders. At 8:00 PM on the 30th, the higher authorities ordered the Xingtang County Armed Forces Department to urgently assemble seven militia stretcher companies to participate in the war. The militia in various districts also concentrated in response to the order. By 8:00 PM on the 31st, nine militia stretcher companies had arrived at the designated assembly point and departed, exceeding the task assigned by the higher authorities. The militia in the old liberated area of ​​Koutou District performed best in this emergency assembly. This district is a mountainous area, about 50 li from the city, with a vast territory, more than 80 li wide from east to west, sparsely populated, and inconvenient transportation. After receiving the mobilization order, Comrade Han Binglin, Secretary of the District Party Committee, and Comrade Li Luozeng, Deputy Secretary, immediately sent cadres to mobilize party members and the masses in various village branches to actively participate in the war. Within one day, they mobilized two militia stretcher companies and personally led them to the designated assembly point at the afternoon of the 31st, fully demonstrating the enthusiasm of party member cadres and the militia in the old liberated area to support the front. According to statistics, the county mobilized a total of 8,437 militiamen and laborers, 630 carts, 3,045 livestock, and 219 stretchers in this war preparation, and all completed the emergency tasks of war preparation and frontline support assigned by the higher authorities. The reason why the Xingtang militia was able to complete the task quickly in this emergency war preparation was due to the county party committee and the county armed forces department strengthening the leadership of the militia work and rectifying the militia work after August, which played a decisive role. During the land reform and party rectification period last winter, the Xingtang County leading organs once relaxed the leadership of the militia work, causing the militia in various villages to develop tendencies towards being unorganized and undisciplined in a short period of time, especially neglecting the leadership of the stretcher-bearing militia supporting the front, failing to equip them with certain cadres and party members to lead and control them, resulting in serious desertion. For example, in July this year, of the 170 militiamen from the Fifth District of the county who went to northern Baoding to support the front, there were no responsible cadres to lead them, and only more than 20 party members were equipped, who could not play a core role and could not unite the masses, resulting in the desertion of more than 120 people. At the same time, the phenomenon of concealing labor was also extremely serious. According to preliminary investigations by the County Armed Forces Department, there were more than 1,000 laborers concealed in various villages, resulting in an unbalanced war effort burden on the masses in some areas, causing dissatisfaction among many masses, and forming a situation in which the militia organizations in most villages were nominal and ineffective. This aroused the serious attention of the County Party Committee, and in August it convened an enlarged meeting of all county armed cadres, in which the County Party Committee reviewed the past tendency of neglecting the leadership of the militia work, and decided to strengthen the leadership of the militia work, rectify the militia work from three aspects: rectifying ideology, rectifying organization, and rectifying discipline, and adjust the service burden, specifically instructing various districts to strengthen the leadership of the militia work. It stipulated that each stretcher supporting the front must be equipped with certain party members and militia cadres to lead, which greatly strengthened the backbone role of party members in the militia, transformed the militia work, and enabled many militia organizations that had collapsed to stand up again. The phenomenon of desertion among the five militia stretcher companies sent to Taiyuan a month ago was greatly reduced, and in this emergency war preparation, they were also able to quickly complete the war preparation tasks.

　　行唐民兵经过整顿组织加强
  　备战支前迅速完成
    【本报特讯】在抗战期间曾经跟日寇伪军奋斗过的行唐民兵，在最近保卫保石线的紧急备战支前总动员中又坚强地站起来，迅速完成了上级所分配的紧急备战支前任务。当上月二十七日上级下达了紧急动员令，指定了行唐民兵破交的具体任务之后，行唐县委暨县武装部立即发出紧急命令，动员行唐城附近各村民兵紧急集合，准备破交。一夜之内，四千余民兵随即集中待命。卅日下午八时，上级命令行唐县武装部紧急集合七个民兵担架连参战。各区民兵亦随即应命集中，至卅一日下午八时，有九个民兵担架连到指定集中地点集中出发，超过了上级所分配的任务。这次紧急集合中，老区口头区的民兵表现最好。该区是山地区，距城约五十里，辖境广阔，东西宽八十余里，地广人稀，交通不便，该区区委书记韩秉林同志和副书记李洛增同志，于接获动员令后，立即派出干部深入动员各村支部党员群众积极参战，一天之内，动员了两个民兵担架连，于卅一日下午亲自带到指定集中地点集合，充分表现出老区党员干部和民兵支前的积极性。统计该县这次备战中共动员民兵民工八千四百卅七名、大车六百卅辆、牲口三千零四十五头、担架二百一十九副，全部完成了上级所分配的备战支前紧急任务。这次紧急备战中行唐民兵之所以能迅速地完成了任务，县委和县武装部在八月份之后加强了对民兵工作的领导、整理民兵工作，起着决定的作用。在去年冬天土改整党时期，行唐县领导机关曾一度放松了对民兵工作的领导，致使各村民兵在短时间内亦滋生了无组织、无纪律偏向，特别是对支前民兵担架的领导不重视，不配备一定的干部和党员去带领掌握，曾产生逃亡的严重现象。如今年七月间该县五区到保北支前的一百七十余名民兵中，无负责干部带领，只配备党员廿余人，不能起核心作用，不能团结群众，结果逃亡一百二十余名。同时，隐瞒劳力的现象，亦异常严重，据县武装部初步调查出各村隐瞒的劳力有千余人，造成某些地区群众战勤负担不平衡现象，引起许多群众不满，形成大部分村庄民兵组织有名无实，不起作用。这引起了县委的严重注意，在八月间召开了全县武装干部的扩大会，由县委检讨过去忽视对民兵工作领导的偏向，决定加强对民兵工作的领导，从整思想、整组织、整纪律三方面整顿民兵工作，并调整勤务负担，具体指示各区加强对民兵工作的领导。规定每副支前担架，必须配备一定党员和民兵干部带领，大大加强了党员在民兵中的骨干作用，转变了民兵工作，使许多垮了台的民兵组织又站起来了。一个月之前派往太原支前的五个民兵担架连逃亡现象大为减少，这次紧急备战中，亦能迅速完成备战任务。
