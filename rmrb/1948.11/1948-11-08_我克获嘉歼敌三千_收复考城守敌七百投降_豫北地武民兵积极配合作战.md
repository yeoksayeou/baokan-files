Xinhua News Agency, North China, 6th: A unit of the People's Liberation Army on the northern Henan front, in coordination with the Taihang local forces, liberated Huojia city on the Daokou-Qinghua Railway, about 40 li west of Xinxiang, on the morning of the 2nd. The defending bandits, consisting of the Henan Security Regiment and over 3,000 local armed bandits, were annihilated except for about 30 who fled. The results of the battle are still being investigated.

Xinhua News Agency, North China, 6th: A delayed report from Ji-Lu-Yu: The 700-plus defending enemies of Kaocheng County, located about 150 li northeast of Kaifeng at the intersection of Henan and Hebei provinces, surrendered completely to the People's Liberation Army on the 29th of last month, and the city was immediately recovered. The surrendered enemies consisted of about 500 soldiers from a battalion of the 74th Division of the Kuomintang's 55th Army, and the remainder were from the Security Regiment. The captured equipment included one mortar, five 60mm mortars, 24 light and heavy machine guns, and other weapons.

Taihang Telegram: Under the successive victories of our army on the southern front and the Daokou-Qinghua front, our Huixian Brigade and Xinxiang Independent Battalion also took the initiative to attack, penetrating deep into the enemy's rear, and successively forcing the enemy back from three strongholds. On the 22nd, the enemies entrenched at Baiquan, five li northwest of Huixian city, and at Jiushengying, over ten li southwest of the city, fled in panic into the city, and these two strongholds were immediately occupied by us. On the 23rd, our Huixian Brigade advanced again into the area south of the county seat and ambushed the enemy stronghold at Mengzhuang at night, cutting off the enemy's telegraph lines between Xinxiang and Huixian. On the same day, the defending enemies at Heqiao and Mengzhuang strongholds hurriedly fled back into the city. The Xinxiang Independent Battalion was also actively operating in the area northwest of Xinxiang city. On the 25th and 26th, the defending enemies in Huaicunying, Hehe, Chenbao, Lubao and other places 20 li from the city fled to Xinxiang city, and these strongholds were thus brought under our control. At present, the local armed forces in the Xinxiang-Huixian area are active day and night on the Xinxiang-Huixian highway, attacking and threatening the enemy, and launching a political offensive to publicize our army's great victories in liberating Zhengzhou, etc.

Taihang Telegram: During the People's Liberation Army's offensive against the enemy west of Xinxiang on the northern Henan front, the people of the counties of the Fourth Military District organized elite militia rotation teams, who rushed to the front lines to strongly support the People's Liberation Army in combat, and followed the main force in encircling and intercepting fleeing enemies. Before our army recovered Jiaozuo, on the morning of the 24th, the Bo'ai militia rotation team cooperated with our army in pursuing the enemies fleeing from Lifeng, Wangfeng, and Fengfeng towards Jiaozuo, chasing them all the way to the outskirts of the city. In the afternoon of the same day, six militia rotation teams from Xiuwu and other counties, while cooperating with our army in intercepting over 2,000 enemies fleeing east from Jiaozuo on the highway north of Su Lan (in Xiuwu), fought bravely, capturing 80 enemies and seizing two light machine guns. They then followed a unit of our army to pursue the enemy to Daiwangzhen, besieging them for a whole night and morning. The enemy fled in panic to Xiuwu city. Before the defending enemy at Muluan Dian (Xincheng, Wuzhi) fled, the Wuzhi militia rotation team had already approached the suburbs of the city and actively harassed the enemy.

Taihang Telegram: After our army liberated Zhengzhou, occupied the Yellow River Iron Bridge, and won successive victories on the Daokou-Qinghua front, the Kuomintang army and local Chiang bandits entrenched in Xinxiang, Anyang, Huixian, Jixian and other places were extremely panicked. The lower-level officers and soldiers of the enemy forces eagerly hoped that our army would liberate them as soon as possible. The high-ranking officers of the Kuomintang 40th Army in Xinxiang were also pessimistic and disappointed, lacking confidence. Some senior officers entrenched in Xinxiang spent their days drinking and making merry, trying to dispel their worries. As of the end of last month, the defending enemies in the city had been dispersed by company to various parts of the city, and were hastily demolishing civilian houses within 100 meters of the city walls, vainly attempting to obstruct our attack on the city. The defending enemies in the isolated city of Huixian were extremely panicked, closing the city gates as soon as it got dark. During the day, only the east gate was open, while the north and west gates remained tightly closed. The defending enemies in Anyang also hurriedly moved the grain stored outside the city into the city, and prepared to gather the bandits from the strongholds outside the city into the city, transferring the regular army to defend the strongholds outside the city in order to suppress their internal wavering. However, our army's powerful offensive had already made the enemy's internal situation extremely unstable and beyond salvation. After our liberation of Zhengzhou, a certain township head of the enemy in Xinxiang cried bitterly, regretting that he "had not connected with the People's Liberation Army in the past."

　　我克获嘉歼敌三千
    收复考城守敌七百投降
  　豫北地武民兵积极配合作战
    【新华社华北六日电】豫北前线人民解放军一部，配合太行地方部队，于二日晨解放新乡以西约四十华里道清路上的获嘉城。守匪河南保安团及匪部乡镇武装三千余名，除三十余名溃逃外，余均被歼，战果正清查中。
    【新华社华北六日电】冀鲁豫迟到消息：开封东北约一百五十里位于河南与河北两省交界处的考城县城的守敌七百余名，于上月二十九日全部向解放军投降，该城当即收复。投降之敌为国民党五十五军七十四师的一个营约五百余名，其余为保安团。计缴获迫击炮一门，六零炮五门，轻重机枪二十四挺及其他武器一部。
    【太行电】在南线与道清前线我军节节胜利下，我辉线大队与新乡独立营亦主动出击，深入敌后，先后逼退敌三个据点。二十二日，困守辉县城西北五里之白泉与城西南十余里九圣营之敌，仓慌窜至城里，该二据点当即被我占领。二十三日我辉县大队复又挺进该县城南一带活动，夜晚袭击孟庄敌据点，并切断新乡、辉县间之敌电线。当天和桥、孟庄两据点之守敌即连忙窜回城内，新乡独立营亦积极活跃于新乡城西北一带，二十五、二十六两日距城二十里之槐村营、合河、陈堡、鲁堡等地守敌逃往新乡城，这些据点遂为我控制。现我新（乡）辉（县）地区之地方武装，日夜活跃于新（乡）辉（县）公路上，出击、威胁敌人，并展开政治攻势，宣传我军解放郑州等大胜利。
    【太行电】豫北前线人民解放军在向新乡以西的敌人发动攻势中，四分区各县人民均组织了精干的民兵轮战队，纷纷奔赴前线，有力支援解放军作战，并随主力围攻与截击逃窜之敌人。在我军收复焦作之前，二十四日上午，博爱民兵轮战队配合我军追击由李封、王封、冯封向焦作逃窜之敌人，一直追到该市郊外。当日下午，修武等县之六个民兵轮战队于配合我军在苏兰（属修武）以北公路上截击由焦作向东逃窜之两千多敌人时，英勇战斗，俘敌八十名，缴获轻机枪二挺。继又跟随我军一部追到待王镇，整整围攻敌一夜又一上午，敌仓慌夺路窜至修武城。在木栾店（武陟新城）守敌未逃窜前，武陟民兵轮战队亦已逼近城郊，积极袭扰敌人。
    【太行电】我军解放郑州、占领黄河铁桥、并在道清前线连获胜利后，孤守新乡、安阳、辉县、汲县等地国民党军与土著蒋匪异常恐慌，敌下层官兵切盼我军火速解放他们。新乡国民党四十军上层军官亦悲观失望，没有信心。据守新乡某些高级军官，每天喝酒取乐，消磨愁日。截至上月底止，该城守敌已按连为单位分散至城内各处，并正在仓慌拆毁城外一百米以内之民房，妄图阻我攻城。辉县孤城守敌恐慌至极，一到天黑即紧闭城门，白天除东门外，南北西门都紧闭不开，安阳守敌亦慌忙将城外之屯粮搬至城里，并准备将城外据点之土匪都圈集城里，将正规军调至城外据守，以压制其内部的动摇。但我军的强大攻势已使敌人内部动摇不堪，无法挽救，当我解放郑州后，新乡敌某乡长即抱头大哭，悔恨自己“过去为啥没有与解放军接过头。”
