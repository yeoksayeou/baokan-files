Xinhua News Agency, North China, 16th: The four million citizens of Pingjin, tormented by rampant inflation and severe food shortages that have left them with no means of survival, are eagerly awaiting the liberation by our army day and night.

	Due to the increasingly severe food shortages, the cities of Pingjin are in complete chaos, and the ruling order of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has been paralyzed. Rice riots are occurring everywhere, and the Kuomintang military police cannot suppress them even by opening fire. To survive, the workers of the tram, telephone, water, and electricity companies in Pingjin have gone on strike one after another, and the telegraph bureau employees are engaging in partial slowdowns. Well-known factories in North China, such as Jiuda and Zhongfang, have either stopped production or reduced output. Jiuda workers clashed with the factory over obtaining food rations. Layoffs are widespread in industry and commerce, and merchants are full of complaints. After professors from universities such as Peking University, Tsinghua University, Normal University, and Nankai University went on strike demanding improved treatment, more than three thousand municipal primary school teachers in Peiping collectively took leave, declaring that they were going to "squeeze for flour" (queue to buy flour). Dozens of municipal middle school faculty and staff are also demanding the distribution of food rations. Civil servants are listless every day, taking leave under various pretexts to avoid going to work. The entire population of Pingjin is filled with unease and resentment against the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang.

	In the daily conversations of Pingjin citizens, the term "Chairman" or "President" is no longer heard when referring to Chiang Kai-shek; instead, he is called "Old Rascal." The entire reactionary ruling clique is referred to as "this bunch" or "this bunch of bastards." Due to the great victories of the People's Liberation Army, the citizens are more clearly aware that the Kuomintang reactionaries' occupation of Pingjin will not last long. "It's blown over, it's collapsed, it's finished," "at most two months" are the almost unanimous conclusions that citizens often express when discussing the current situation. Therefore, their desire for liberation is even more urgent. Many middle-class people also openly hope that "the Eighth Route Army will come sooner, so that the people will not suffer." Even the police are waiting for the Liberation Army to take over.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Reports from various sources indicate that the rice riots, flight from famine, and strikes, like wildfire, have turned Shanghai, the economic center of the Kuomintang-controlled area, into a chaotic world. From the 6th to the 11th of this month, 38 rice riots have broken out in six days, with more than six occurring each day, and as many as several thousand starving people participating in the riots. Although the Shanghai Kuomintang authorities hastily established a special police dispatch team on the 9th to guard the grain stores, and "Flying Fortresses" (armored police vehicles) sped through the streets all day, they still could not stop the wave of rice grabbing. At the same time, the poor people who felt they could no longer live in Shanghai were scrambling to leave this starving city and escape to their old homes in the countryside. Carrying bundles of clothes tied into small packages, they crowded day and night at the train stations waiting to board the trains. On the 11th, four people were trampled to death while scrambling to buy tickets. More than 30 trains departing from Shanghai each day were packed with people fleeing the famine. Grain stores have closed their doors, and most shops only display a small amount of goods for sale for a short time before quickly closing; wholesale trade has completely stopped, and the market presents a desolate scene. Shop owners complain, "Because the value of the currency is decreasing every minute, it is impossible to do business." The anti-hunger strikes by train, tram, and water workers caused only two trains to depart from Shanghai on the 9th, tram traffic was paralyzed, and the city's water supply was drastically reduced.

　　对国民党反动统治充满怨愤
  　平津人民盼望解放
    上海粮荒严重成了混乱世界
    【新华社华北十六日电】被风狂似的物价与严重的粮荒折磨得无以为生的四百万平津市民，日夜盼望我军解放。
    由于粮荒的日益严重，平津两市已是一片混乱，蒋传匪帮的统治秩序已经瘫痪。到处是抢米风潮，国民党的军警开枪也无法镇压。为了生活，平津的电车、电话、自来水、电力公司工人，相继罢工，电报局职工则进行局部怠工。华北著名的久大、中纺等工厂不是停工便是减产，久大工人则因争取食粮而与厂方冲突。工商业普遍裁人，商人怨声四起。北京、清华、师院、南开等大学教授罢教要求改善待遇之后，北平三千多市立小学教员又集体总请假，宣称要去“挤面”（排队买面），十多个市立中学教职员，也在要求发配粮。公务员们每日无精打彩，相率借故不去办公。整个平津两市各阶层人民中间充满着不安与对国民党反动统治的怨愤。
    在平津市民平时谈话中，对蒋贼已再也听不到什么“委员长”、“大总统”的称呼，而代之以“老小子”了。对整个反动统治集团则都用“这伙子”、“这伙子王八蛋”来相称。由于人民解放军的伟大胜利，市民都更清楚认识国民党反动派盘踞平津的寿命是不会久的了。“吹了，塌了，完了”，“最多不过两个月”，这是市民谈论时局时常常挂在嘴边的几乎是一致的结论。因此他们盼望解放的心更切。许多中产阶层也公开希望“八路军早点来，免得人民受苦”。连警察也在等待解放军去接收。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】各方报导：如火燎原的抢米、逃荒、罢工，已使国民党统治区经济中心上海成为混乱世界。从本月六日至十一日六天中，抢米骚动已爆发三十八次，每日均在六次以上，抢米饥民常达数千人。虽然上海国民党当局慌忙于九日成立特别警察派遣队，看守粮店，“飞行堡垒”（装甲警车）整日疾驰街头，但仍不能阻止抢粮浪潮。与此同时，感到在上海已无法生活下去的贫民们正争先恐后地离开这一饥饿的城市，向乡村的老家逃生。他们抱着捆成小包的衣物，不分昼夜蜂拥在火车站上等候上车。十一日因抢购车票，有四个人被踏死。每天由上海开出的三十多次班车都挤满了逃荒的人群。粮店都已关门闭户，大多数商店只摆出少量货物卖一会儿就赶快关门；批发交易完全停顿，市面呈现出一片凄惨景象。店主们诉苦说：“由于币值每分钟都在减低，不可能做生意。”火车、电车和自来水工人的反饥饿罢工，使九日一个整天全上海只有两列火车开出，电车交通瘫痪，全市供水量骤减。
