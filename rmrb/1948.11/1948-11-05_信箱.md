    To Comrade Xie Cong of the Huaye × Corps:
    Regarding the issue that you have joined the army from school, and the district and village still do not provide treatment for revolutionary military families despite a letter of proof from the army, it has been transferred to the Civil Affairs Section of the county for resolution. As for the issue of substitute cultivation, it should be decided based on the labor situation of your family.
    To Su Minjun, Pengcheng Town, Cixian:
    We have forwarded your reflection on the situation in Pengcheng where the struggle against private industrial and commercial businesses has not yet been reversed to the Cixian County Committee for their review.
    To Zhou Ziyuan, Houjiazhuang, Zhengding:
    The family situation you described in your letter is not specific enough, so it is impossible to determine your class status. If you believe that being classified as a rich peasant is incorrect, you can apply to the district government to have it re-examined among the masses based on the class division criteria.
    To Li Bingjun, Yongli Factory:
    Regarding your reflection that Shi Hongyou, who runs a shop in Xiquantou Village, Eighth District, Cixian, was wrongly struggled against during the land reform, and now only an empty house has been returned, making it impossible to operate the business, it has been transferred to the Eighth District of Cixian for their investigation and handling.
    To Cheng Quangui, Zhengding × District:
    Regarding the question of a child who remarried with their mother, and their original father requesting to have them returned, please refer to the "Questions and Answers" column of this newspaper on October 11th.
    To Comrade Cui Tianshen, Wuxiang County Government:
    Destroying old contracts after issuing new land ownership certificates is a government regulation. If some people are unwilling to exchange them, they can be mobilized and explained to, clarifying that old contracts have lost their validity after land reform, so that they can understand the significance of the new land ownership certificates.
    To Jia Yousan, Yeli Village, Jingxing:
    Your request for a review of your class status and for resettlement or compensation, passing you from the county to the district, and from the district to the village, and the village ignoring you, is an inappropriate way for the local government to handle the problem. We have forwarded your comments to the Jingxing County Committee for their resolution.

    信箱华野×兵团谢聪同志：
    你已从学校参加部队，并由部队写信证明，而区村仍不按革命军属待遇的问题，已转任县民政科解决。至于代耕问题，应按你家劳力情况决定。磁县彭城镇苏民君：
    你反映彭城尚未退被斗工商业的情况，我们已转磁县县委会，请他们检查。正定侯家庄周滋元君：
    来信所说家庭情况不够具体，无法确定是何成份。你认为确定为富农不对，可以申请区政府，根据划阶级标准，在群众中重新审订。永利工厂黎冰君：
    你所反映磁县八区西泉头村，开店的石宏友在土改中被错斗，现在只退一座空房，无法营业的情况，已转磁县八区，请他们调查处理。正定×区成全贵君：
    关于随母改嫁的孩子，其原父要求索回的问题，请参看十月十一日本报询问答复栏。武乡县府崔天申同志：
    颁发新土地证后，销毁旧文契，这是政府的规定，如有的群众不愿换，可向其动员解释，说明土改后，旧文契已失去效用，让其认识新土地证之意义。井陉冶里村贾友三君：
    你要求审订成份，并予安置或补偿，找县推区，找区推村，找村不管，当地政府这样处理问题是不妥当的，我们已将你的意见转告井陉县委，请他们解决。
