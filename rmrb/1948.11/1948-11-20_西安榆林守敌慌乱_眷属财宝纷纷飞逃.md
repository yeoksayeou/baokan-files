　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th. Under the victorious impact of the People's Liberation Army's autumn offensive, the enemy troops defending Xi'an and Yulin are in a state of panic and chaos. The Chiang Kai-shek and Hu bandit gangs in Xi'an are making all kinds of final desperate arrangements. Since October 20th, Hu has ordered merchants and civilians in the city to store three to six months' worth of grain in preparation for a siege, and has expelled poor people who cannot afford to store three months' worth of grain from the city. In addition to the original three lines of defense, Hu has recently built a fourth line of defense in the suburbs; in Lintong, Kangqiao, and Chuanzhen, a second outer defense line is being hastily built. Despite this, they also know that they cannot hold the city, and the families and wealth of many important gang officials have fled to Shanghai and Hong Kong. The families of general officers have also been ordered to gather and scatter to Sichuan. The isolated enemy stronghold of Yulin in northern Shaanxi, since the People's Liberation Army liberated Baotou in Suiyuan on October 23rd, cutting off its direct connection with Fu Zuoyi's lair, and after annihilating more than 500 bandits of Bao's unit in Haladong and Changloudian in western Suiyuan, the defending enemy Deng and Ma bandit troops are extremely panicked, and their families are selling their valuables and fleeing west. At the same time, Hu Zongnan has also airlifted his troops in Yulin elsewhere, weakening the city's defense forces. At present, the city is experiencing a severe grain shortage, prices are soaring, shops are closing, and factories are going bankrupt. The city, which originally enjoyed the reputation of a major commercial town in northern Shaanxi, has suddenly become desolate. The citizens generally distrust the bogus gold yuan, and its exchange rate for silver dollars has plummeted from two to one to eighteen to one. In October, merchants went on strike twice to refuse to use the bogus gold yuan. The citizens are all eagerly hoping for early liberation, and many are secretly asking the masses in the liberated areas about the democratic government's various policies and measures.

　　西安榆林守敌慌乱
  　眷属财宝纷纷飞逃
    【新华社延安十七日电】在人民解放军秋季攻势胜利的冲击下，西安、榆林守敌陷于惊慌混乱。西安蒋、胡匪帮正作种种最后挣扎的布置。从十月二十日起，胡匪即勒令城内商民储粮三月至六月以备困守，并将无力储粮三月的贫民逐出城外。除原来三道防御工事外，胡匪近复在四郊增筑第四道工事；在临潼、康桥、川镇则赶筑第二道外围防线。尽管这样，他们也明知守不住这个城市，许多匪帮重要官员眷属、财富已纷纷飞逃上海、香港。一般军官眷属亦已奉命集中全散往四川。陕西北面的敌孤立据点榆林，自人民解放军十月廿三日解放绥远包头，截断其与傅匪作义老巢的直接联系，并在绥西哈拉洞、长楼店追歼土匪宝所部五百余人后，守敌邓、马匪军异常恐慌，其眷属纷纷变卖细软西逃。与此同时，胡匪宗南又将其在榆之部队空运他处，该城防御力量形削弱。现该城粮慌极为严重，物价飞涨，商店关门，工厂倒闭，原享陕北商业重镇盛名之该城，顿成荒凉。市民对伪金圆券普遍不信任，其对银圆之兑换率已由二比一猛跌至十八比一，十月间商贩为拒用伪金圆券曾两度罢市。市民均极盼早日解放，多暗中向解放区群众探问民主政府各种政策措施。
