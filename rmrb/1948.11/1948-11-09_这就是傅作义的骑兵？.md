　　So This Is Fu Zuoyi's Cavalry?
    Liuxin
  　Night Raid on Beiwang
    On the morning of October 29th, over 1,000 bandits from Fu Zuoyi's 12th Cavalry Brigade sneaked across the Tang River and encamped in the Beiwang area of Ding County. After our troops received the news, they immediately launched an attack on the enemy. The battle began at dawn on the 30th. Concentrated firepower broke through the enemy's forward positions in eight minutes. Agile artillery extended the attack deep into the enemy's camp, with shells landing one after another. The enemy, like dumb pigs, scurried around in chaos. One cavalryman was captured by the People's Liberation Army in a daze as soon as he stepped out of the door. Two sentries who attempted to resist were shot dead next to their fortifications. In thirty minutes, the entire 24th Cavalry Regiment of the enemy was driven out of the village.
    When the brave warriors of the People's Liberation Army returned from the pursuit, the power lines on the street were intact, and in the houses occupied by the Fu bandits' army, some still had rows of hand grenades left behind.
    Pursuit for Thirty Li
    All the commanders and fighters of a certain unit forgot the fatigue after a long march. In Dongzhuang, after scattering the enemy's forces, they immediately switched from assault to pursuit. The enemy fled to Xiaowangwen, just about to eat, when the People's Liberation Army caught up. The enemy, only caring about saving their lives, abandoned their food and dishes all over the courtyard. East of Youdi Village, more than 300 enemies were about to rest when the People's Liberation Army suddenly appeared to their west. As soon as the machine gun fired, some of the enemies, unable to care for their horses, grabbed the reins and were dragged staggeringly by the horses, running all over the ground in chaos. East of Zhangjiaying Village, the enemy abandoned a warhorse exhausted beyond repair on the side of the road. The Jian'an militia also captured an enemy warhorse. The pursued enemy, while running, angrily shouted, "Damn it, they said that after we crossed the river, the infantry would follow, but they tricked us across the river, and the infantry still hasn't come, letting those guys (referring to the People's Liberation Army) chase us so far that we can't even eat... …." In this pursuit battle, all the commanders and fighters of a certain unit, including the sick, did not fall behind.
    "Is this Fu Zuoyi's elite cavalry?"
    "Infantry chasing cavalry for thirty li, only the People's Liberation Army can do this." These words have become a mockery of the Fu bandits by the soldiers of a certain unit and the masses in the war zone. (Jizhong Telegram)

　　这就是傅作义的骑兵？
    留心
  　夜袭北旺
    十月二十九日上午，傅匪整骑十二旅千余人，窜过唐河，宿在定县北旺一带。我某部得到消息后，马上向敌出击，战斗在三十日拂晓开始。集中火力八分钟就把敌人的前沿阵地冲破。机警的炮兵向纵深发展，炮弹一个个落在敌人阵营里。敌人象蠢猪一样，乱撞乱窜，一个骑兵刚一出门口，就糊里糊涂的当了解放军的俘虏；企图抵抗的两个哨兵被打死在工事一边。战斗三十分钟，敌骑兵二十四团全部，即被驱逐出村。
    当解放军的勇士们追击回来的时候，街上电线完好无损，傅匪军住的屋里，有的还留一排排的手榴弹。
    追击三十里
    某部全体指战员，忘掉了长途行军后的疲劳。在东庄，他们把敌人的队伍打散后，立时由冲锋转为追击。敌人逃到小王稳，正想吃饭，解放军追上来，敌人只顾逃命，饭菜遗弃满院；在游堤村东，三百多敌人，刚要休息，解放军突然又在他们的西面出现。机枪一响，敌人有的顾不得不马，捉住缰绳，被马拉的踉踉跄跄，满地乱窜；在张家营村东，敌人把一匹疲劳不堪的战马，丢在路旁；建安民兵也缴获了敌人一匹战马。被追的敌人，一面跑一面气的嚷：“他娘的，说让我们过河后，步兵就跟上来，把我们哄过河来，步兵还不来，叫人家（指解放军）追了这么远，连饭也吃不上………。”在这场追击战中，某部全体指战员，连病号在内，没有一个掉队的。
    “这就是傅作义的那骑兵劲旅吗？”
    “步兵追击骑兵三十里，除了解放军天下少有。”这些话，已成为某部战士和战地群众对傅匪的讽刺。（冀中电）
