　　Shijiazhuang Celebrates the First Anniversary of Liberation
    Rapid Completion of Production Resumption
  　Various Public Factories Launch Production Competitions One After Another
    [Report from this newspaper] The workers of Shijiazhuang are now creating production miracles in large numbers to celebrate the first anniversary of the city's liberation. This also serves as a practical gift from the city's working class to celebrate the liberation of the entire Northeast, and the successive victories on the North China, East China, and Central Plains fronts. Half a month ago, in order to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in thoroughly crushing the bandit Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi's attempt to raid Shijiazhuang, all the workers, staff, and other citizens of Shijiazhuang completed all war preparations at the highest speed. Earlier this month, the Tang River battle defeated the bandit Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi's invasion, and the workers of Shijiazhuang completed all production resumption work at an even faster speed. A certain factory on the Shijiazhuang-Dezhou and Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan railways had machines installed for decades, most of which were moved away during this war preparation. When resuming work, the original plan was for a month's work, but after discussion and research by workers and staff, it was changed to two weeks. As a result, all installation plans were completed within twenty-four hours. Some departments even took less time, taking only sixteen hours from start to finish. The electric company, which was originally planned to take at least ten days, completed all resumption work in just three days. A certain cotton mill, which was estimated to take at least one or two months to resume production, started operations in a week and added 4,000 spindles. The telephone bureau completed the installation of 200 automatic telephone sets (three characters) ahead of schedule, exceeding the plan by two times. On November 12, the anniversary of the liberation of Shijiazhuang, at a "Celebration of War Preparation Victory, Summary of Resumption, and Mobilization of Production Conference" at a certain railway factory, all workers and staff unanimously agreed to accept the Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee's call to launch an unprecedented production competition, and to promote this movement to the entire railway, proposing to make up for all the losses caused by the bandits Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi during the war preparation period within the next month and a half, and strive to exceed the plan and complete certain two types of machine parts ahead of schedule. At this meeting, Cui En'yuan, an old worker from the "February 7th" strike era, couldn't help but jump onto the podium, and the first thing he said was: "Today, we are all happy, we are all joyful!" He said: "Why are we happy? Because our proletariat in Shijiazhuang has been liberated for a year. This time, our proletariat and our own People's Liberation Army, attacking from the north and south, drove away those grandsons of Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi, protected our machines, and protected our jobs. This time, for the resumption, we only used twenty-four hours to complete two weeks of work." He raised his fist and said, "This is the power of our working class!" Young worker Li Zibin said, "Fu Zuoyi wanted to take away our jobs, but now he didn't take them away. So what should we do?" The echo from the audience was: "We must complete the tasks assigned to us by the higher authorities ahead of schedule!" The upsurge of production competition is now gradually spreading to various public factories in Shijiazhuang.

　　石家庄庆祝解放一周年
    迅速完成生产复员
  　各公营工厂陆续发起生产竞赛
    【本报讯】石家庄工人现正大量创造生产上的奇迹，来庆祝该市解放一周年纪念。并以此作为全市工人阶级庆祝东北全境解放，庆祝华北、华东、中原各线连续大捷的实际贺礼。在半个月以前，为配合人民解放军彻底粉碎蒋傅匪偷袭石家庄的企图，石市全体工人职员和其他市民，曾以最高的速度完成了全部备战工作。本月初唐河一战，打垮蒋傅匪的进犯，石家庄的工人们又以更快的速度完成了全部生产复员工作。石德、石太铁路某工厂安装几十年的机器，这次备战中大部运走，复工时，原计划一个月的工程，经工人职员讨论研究，改为两个星期，结果在二十四小时内即完成了全部安装计划。有些部门甚至还要少些，从动工至完成任务，先后只用了十六个钟头。原计划起码需时十天的电灯公司，仅用三天功夫把全部复工工作作好。原估计至少也得一两个月才能复工的××纱厂，一个星期就开工了，并新增绽子四千个。电话局则先期超过计划两倍，完成了二百部自动电话机（三个字的）的安装工作。本月十二日，石家庄解放周年纪念日，在铁路某厂“庆祝备战胜利、总结复员、动员生产大会”上，该厂全体工人职员一致通过接受石家庄市委开展一个空前的生产竞赛运动，并把这运动推广到全铁路的号召，提出要在今后一个半月内，把备战期中蒋傅匪所给予的损失，全部弥补起来，而且争取超过计划，先期完成某某两项机件的任务。在这次会上，“二七”罢工时代的老工人崔恩元情不自禁地跳上讲告，开头第一句话就说：“今天咱大家都是喜欢，都是乐的！”他说：“为什么乐呢？因为咱们石家庄的无产阶级解放一年了，这次咱们无产阶级和自己的解放军，南北夹击，两路进攻，把蒋介石傅作义那些龟孙们打走了，保住了我们的机器，保住了我们的饭碗。这次复员，我们只用二十四个钟点，就把两个礼拜的工作做完了。”他高举拳头说：“这就是我们工人阶级的力量！”青年工人李子彬说：“傅作义想夺我们的饭碗，现在我们的饭碗没让他夺走，那末我们该怎么干？”全场的回响是：“要提前完成上级给我们的任务”！生产竞赛的热潮，现正逐渐扩展至石家庄各公营工厂中去。
