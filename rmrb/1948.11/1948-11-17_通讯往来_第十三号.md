　　Correspondence No. 13
To all regional committees, county committee offices, grassroots work groups, and comrade correspondents:

    We have received your winter work plans and deployment situations, work reports, summaries of land reform completion in experimental villages, etc., and are currently studying them separately. In addition to hoping that you will continue to contribute, we hope that you will quickly continue to report on the implementation of the plans. In the work of completing land reform and rectifying the Party, what are some different specific situations? Can the guidelines and plans be implemented? Or what needs to be modified? What new deviations and difficulties have been encountered in each stage of work (such as revising components, supplementing, issuing land certificates, preliminary rectification of branches, etc.)? How were they solved? What achievements and experiences have been made? What are the changes in the ideological emotions of the masses at each stage of work? What are the different situations in disaster areas and non-disaster areas in winter production work? How to organize the masses to develop sideline and handicraft production? How to prepare for next year's large-scale production (such as accumulating fertilizer, building water conservancy projects, repairing farm tools, animal husbandry, afforestation, etc.)? What organizational forms were used? What achievements have been made? What are the differences from winter production in previous years? What have the cooperatives done in winter production? How do state-owned stores and trade departments serve production? What problems still exist in the masses' thinking? We hope to report on all of these specifically. We also hope that you will make a copy for us of your temporary situation problems and work reports to higher authorities.
