　　Introduction to Inner Mongolia
    On August 9, 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. The people of Inner Mongolia rose up in response, organizing the Inner Mongolia People's Self-Defense Army, the Autonomous Army, etc. (now organized into the unified Inner Mongolia People's Liberation Army) to cooperate with the Soviet Red Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the war against Japan. In November of the same year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Organization Federation was established in Western Mongolia. In December, the Eastern Mongolian Autonomous Government was established in Eastern Mongolia. On April 3 of the following year (1946), with the help of the Chinese Communist Party, representatives from Eastern and Western Mongolia met in Chengde and unanimously agreed that the Inner Mongolia People's Autonomous Movement and various autonomous organizations in Eastern and Western Mongolia should be unified under the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation, with Yun Ze (alternate member of the CCP Central Committee), the leader of the Inner Mongolian people, as chairman, and Boyan Mandu as vice chairman. In the third year (1947), on May 1st, the Inner Mongolian people held a representative conference in Wangye Temple, passed the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government's Program and the draft Organic Law, legally elected the Inner Mongolia Provisional Senate, and elected Boyan Mandu as Speaker of the Senate and Yun Ze as Chairman of the Autonomous Government. The Autonomous Government announced its establishment on May 5. The capital of the Autonomous Government is Wangye Temple, now renamed Ulanhot. The local administrative division is divided into four levels: (1) League (province), (2) Banner (county), (3) Nutuk and Sumu (district), (4) Aili, Gacha and Bagayaohe (township or administrative village). The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is organized by the leagues and banners of the Mongolian ethnic groups in the northeastern provinces and the provinces of Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Ningxia. The six leagues of Jerim League, Josutu League, Jao Uda League, Hinggan League, Navin Muran League, and Hulunbuir League in the northeast are generally called Eastern Mongolia. The six leagues and departments of Xilin Gol League, Ikezhao League, Usu Chabu League, Chahar League, Bayantala League, and Ningxia Mongolia in Chahar, Suiyuan, Rehe, and Ningxia are generally called Western Mongolia. In total, there are twelve leagues and departments, and seventy-nine banners. The current area of the entire region is approximately 1.5 million square kilometers, with a population of over 11.4 million, including 2 million Inner Mongolian people. The Mongolian banners within Suiyuan and Ningxia have not yet been fully liberated.
