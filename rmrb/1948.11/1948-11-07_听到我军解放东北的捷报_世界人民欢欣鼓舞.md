Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 5th: The glorious victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in liberating the entire Northeast China has shaken the world. According to Agence France-Presse: All newspapers in London published the good news of the People's Liberation Army in Northeast China in prominent positions. Most newspapers in Paris published all the news and comments sent by foreign journalists from Nanjing and Beiping under large headlines. According to a report from Diantong News Agency in Paris on the 2nd, the French Communist newspaper "L'Humanité," in its commentary on the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Northeast China, stated: "The victory of the Chinese people is the victory of all people fighting for independence. It makes the adventurers in Washington, Paris, and London understand that general staff, weapons, and dollars are not everything, thus giving a great blow to the warmongers. In this sense, it is a great victory for the cause of peace." The newspaper particularly emphasized "the completeness and rapidity of the victory of the Chinese people." According to an Agence France-Presse report from Tokyo on the 2nd, Japanese Communist leader Nozaka Sanzō (Okano Susumu), commenting on this victory, said: "It is a harbinger of the victory of the Japanese people's strength," and called on "Japanese communists to draw lessons from Mao Zedong's tactics." The reactionary Japanese newspapers, on the other hand, have published commentaries for days, expressing fear of the growing strength of the Chinese people. A Diantong News Agency reporter commented from London on the 2nd that the liberation of the entire Northeast China by the Chinese People's Liberation Army: "Is the biggest military blow suffered by the US State Department's foreign policy since American imperialism began to strive for world hegemony after the war and oppose democratic and socialist movements. The bankrupt Chiang Kai-shek regime is powerless to stop the advancing People's Liberation Army. Obviously, the balance of power in Asia is changing definitively." The commentary reported that the panicked British and American imperialist newspapers "frankly admitted that due to the incurable weakness of the Kuomintang, more financial transfusions would be of no avail." The commentary quoted the opinions of Chinese democrats in London, stating that because China's major industrial base has been firmly controlled by the People's Army, because the Kuomintang regime as a central government of China is in the final stage of military and political bankruptcy, and because the army led by the Communist Party has received huge and growing support from workers and peasants in areas that are not yet liberated, "all conditions are ripe" for the establishment of a national people's democratic united government in China based mainly on the liberated areas and the Communist Party.

　　听到我军解放东北的捷报
  　世界人民欢欣鼓舞
    【新华社陕北五日电】中国人民解放军解放全东北的辉煌胜利，震动中外。据法新社消息：伦敦一切报纸均以显要地位刊载人民解放军在东北的捷报，巴黎大多数的报纸，均在大字标题下刊载外国记者由南京及北平发出的一切消息和评论。据电通社巴黎二日电报导，法共人道报在评论中国人民解放军在东北的胜利时称：“中国人民的胜利，乃是为独立而斗争的一切人民的胜利。它使华盛顿、巴黎及伦敦的冒险家们了解：参谋本部、武器及美元并不就是一切，从而对主战派给予了一个很大的打击。在这个意义上，它是争取和平的一个大胜利”。该报特别强调“中国人民之胜利的完全性及迅速性”。据法新社东京二日电报导：日共领袖野坂参三（冈野进）评论这一胜利时说：“它是日本人民力量之胜利的一个预示”，并号召“日本共产党人应该从毛泽东的策略中吸取表示”。而日本的反动报纸则连日发表评论，对中国人民力量的日益强大表示恐惧。电通社记者二日从伦敦发出评论，认为中国人民解放军解放全东北：“乃是美国帝国主义开始争取战后世界霸权及反对民主与社会主义运动以来美国国务院外交政策所受最大的一个军事打击。破产的蒋介石政权已无力阻挡进攻中的人民解放军。很显然，亚洲力量的对比正在确定的变化。”该评论报道惊慌的美英帝国主义报纸“坦白承认由于国民党的弱点无可救药，更多的金元输血也无济于事”。该评论引述伦敦中国民主人士的意见称：由于中国的主要工业基地已稳固地掌握在人民军手中，由于国民党政权作为一个中国中央政府已处在军事与政治破产的最后阶段，由于共产党领导的军队受到了现在尚非解放区的工人和农民的巨大而且愈来愈增长的拥护，因而在中国成立一个全国性的以解放区和共产党为主要基础的人民民主联合政府的“一切条件均已成熟”。
