Xinhua News Agency, North China, 29th: The beautiful ancient capital of Beiping is now a scene of chaos and desolation. As a result of the Chiang Kai-shek/Fu Zuoyi bandit gang’s violent price controls and starvation policies, according to incomplete statistics, 2,000 shops in the city have closed. Citizens, unable to buy grain, are constantly staging rice-grabbing disturbances. In mid-October, poor people and workers smashed the Taiheheng in Zhangyimen, the Dejuyong in Dongzhushikou, and the Tiande grain store in Andingmen, and fought with the constabulary and police who rushed to suppress them. Every morning at 4 o'clock, the grain stores are crowded with people buying grain, but many grain stores only sell grain to 30 people a day, one pound per person. Therefore, some people carry empty bags for three or four days without buying a single pound of grain. The stocks of shops in various industries have mostly been transferred to the black market. Pork is extremely scarce. On September 24th, no pigs were slaughtered in any slaughterhouse, an unprecedented phenomenon in Beiping for decades. According to Ma Guoxi, chairman of the Beiping Beef and Mutton Association, from the place of origin to Beiping, beef and mutton have to pay six kinds of taxes. A sheep costs 600,000 yuan "legal tender" at the place of origin, and taxes cost 300,000 yuan. Coupled with the suppression of price controls, there is practically no beef or mutton transported to the market. The famous Dong Lai Shun roast mutton restaurant, which sells ten sheep a day in Ping City, closed on September 25 because it could not maintain its operations. Under these circumstances, prices are rising step by step, grain prices have soared tenfold, and other commodities have also skyrocketed.

Currently, the people, gasping under the heavy pressure of grain panic and rising prices, are facing the season of severe winter. As Beiping is about to enter winter, the streets and alleys are filled with the sounds of people selling their children. A child can be sold for up to 200 million yuan in legal tender, or as little as 6 million yuan, which is 2 yuan in fake gold yuan notes, which cannot be exchanged for six catties of millet. At the same time, in front of the German Hospital and the Central Hospital, a group of people selling their own blood is crowded every day, and they do not disperse until late at night.

These people, unable to make a living under the cruel rule of Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi, place their hopes on the People's Liberation Army. When they heard the news of the liberation of Jinan, the general public spread the word that "the liberation of Beiping will be no later than the wheat harvest next year." Beiping, this oppressed big city, is looking forward to rebirth in liberation.

    北平人民饥饿不安
    希望寄托在解放军
    【新华社华北二十九日电】美丽的古都北平，现在是一片混乱和凄凉。由于蒋傅匪帮的暴力限价和饥饿政策的结果，据不完全统计，全市已有两千家商店关了门。市民们因买不到粮食，不断的酿成抢米骚动。贫民和工人们曾于本月中旬先后砸毁了彰仪门的太和恒，东珠市口的德聚永及安定门的天德等粮食店，并和赶往镇压的宪警发生搏斗。每天早晨四点钟粮店前就挤满了购粮的人，但是许多粮店每天售粮以卅人为限，每人一斤，因此有的人提着空口袋跑三、四天买不着一斤粮食。各业商店存货则大都转入黑市。猪肉极端缺乏，九月二十四日各屠场未杀一只猪，为北平数十年来未有的现象。据北平牛羊肉公会理事长马国玺谈：牛羊从产地到北平，要上六种捐税，一头羊产地价“法币”六十万元，捐税就要三十万元，再加限价的压制，市上巴无牛羊运进。平市每天卖羊十只的著名烤涮羊肉馆东来顺因不能维持，已于九月二十五日关门。在这些情况下，物价步步高涨，粮价激涨了十倍，其他物品也无不飞涨。
    目前，喘息于粮食恐慌和物价高涨重压下的人民又面临着严冬的季节。快要入冬的北平，大街小巷都能听到卖儿的声音，一个小孩最多能卖两亿元法币，少的只卖六百万元，即伪金元券两元，换不到六斤小米。同时在德国医院和中央医院的门口，每天都拥挤着一群出卖自己血液的人，直到深夜还不散去。
    这些在蒋傅虐政下无以为生的人民把希望寄托在解放军。当听到济南解放的消息后，一般市民都传言“北平解放至迟不过明年麦收”。北平，这一在被压迫的大城，正企望着在解放中更生。
