    Jizhong Ninth District Commissioner's Office Calls on Various Regions to Organize the Masses
    趁冬闲修理水车水井
    为明年大生产运动做好准备
    [Jizhong Electric] In order to lay the foundation for next year's production, restore and expand the area of irrigated land, the Jizhong Ninth District Commissioner's Office called on various regions to mobilize and organize the masses to repair broken wells and waterwheels during the winter slack season. According to statistics from Ding County and specific investigations in several villages in Anguo and Boye counties, there are many broken wells and waterwheels. Ding County has a total of 24,077 wells, of which 7,356 are broken, accounting for 30.6% of the total. There are 15,712 waterwheels, of which 5,814 are broken, accounting for 30.7%. According to statistics from ten villages in Shenze County, including Diao Jia Zhuang, Bei Liu Zhuang, Bei Zhao Zhuang, Da Jia Zhuang, Anguo Dong Wang Qi, Ma Gu, Xinle Sanlipu, and Boye Zhou Zhuang, Li Zhuang, there are a total of 1,072 wells and 315 waterwheels, of which 378 wells and 80 waterwheels are broken. In Boye Tuncun Village, 38 of the 76 wells are broken, and 13 of the 26 waterwheels are broken. In Anguo Beibao Village, 9 of the 30 waterwheels are missing buckets, one is missing an iron wheel, and three are missing iron scoops. Combining the statistics of one county and ten villages, there are a total of 25,149 wells, of which 7,734 are broken, and 16,027 waterwheels, of which 5,894 are broken. Because of these broken wells and waterwheels, some cannot irrigate the land, and most can only irrigate less land, reducing the irrigated area and greatly reducing the harvest. For example, in Boye Licun, Bian Luofeng's well was shared by nine families, and because the well was broken, 25 mu of land could not be irrigated. Zhao Jinfu's waterwheel was shared by thirteen families, and twenty buckets were missing. He did not repair it. The one and a half mu of millet planted by Jinfu was not irrigated and only yielded seven shi dou. The same soil quality as Zhao Jinfu's land, Liu Laokao's one and a half mu of millet (with eighteen carts of manure, one hundred jin of soybean cake, and one bucket of brine, hoed three times) was irrigated five times and yielded sixty-three shi dou, which is thirty-one shi dou and eight sheng more per mu than Zhao Jinfu's. Jiang Luoting planted two pieces of millet, the garden land was irrigated four times, with seven carts of grass manure, six baskets of human manure, and a bucket of brine per mu, yielding twenty-two shi dou of millet; the two and a half mu that were not irrigated, with eight carts of grass manure and three baskets of human manure per mu, only yielded five shi dou of millet per mu. Branch Secretary Song Qinglan said: "The village has 58 wells, and 720 mu of land were irrigated less this year, an average of 26 mu less per well. According to the yield of Jiang Laoting's irrigated and non-irrigated land, we harvested twelve thousand two hundred and forty shi dou less." It is understood that the main reasons for the broken wells and waterwheels are insufficient protection of the waterwheels and wells. As the saying goes, "Wells are afraid of freezing, and waterwheels are afraid of bumping," but in many places, the wells are not sheltered in winter, and the waterwheels are not removed, allowing them to be damaged. Another reason is that there is no good organization and education for sharing wells, sharing waterwheels, and borrowing waterwheels for irrigation. Everyone thinks that it is not their own, or not entirely their own, so they do not cherish them, only care about using them without paying attention to protection and repair. Some even do not oil the waterwheels when using them. Because there is no good organization, sometimes the waterwheels are broken and no one takes the lead to repair them, or they do not repair them wholeheartedly. Those who borrow them are unwilling to contribute money to help, and the original owners simply do not repair them. Secondly, due to the lack of education and management of children, unintentional damage by children constantly occurs. Some casually take the firewood for sheltering the wells in winter, some randomly fill the wells with soil and throw bricks for games, and some arbitrarily spoil the waterwheels, etc.
    In order to improve agricultural production and protect and repair waterwheels and wells to restore and expand the area of irrigated land, the Ninth District Commissioner's Office calls on leaders at all levels to pay attention to this issue, further understand the causes and numbers of broken wells and waterwheels, and the situation of shrinking irrigated areas and reduced harvests, to educate the masses with facts, guide the masses to organize themselves, jointly raise funds for repairs, or combine sideline production for repairs. Those who want to repair but have real difficulties will be given loan assistance. It is required that all those who can repair should repair them this winter without delay; those who cannot repair should lead the masses to organize themselves and prepare for next year's repairs from winter production (bricks, materials, funds, etc.). Those who share wells and waterwheels should be led to repair them wholeheartedly, and those who borrow wells and waterwheels should help the original owners to repair them. And plan to organize blacksmiths and carpenters to go to the countryside, organize waterwheel repair factories, and equip waterwheel parts. At the same time, pay attention to supporting brick kilns to solve the difficulties of raw materials and technology. Strengthen the protection of waterwheels and wells, call on the masses to shelter wells and remove waterwheels in winter, educate children not to destroy them randomly, and publicize the Party's policy of rewarding the development of production, explaining that the land will no longer be changed after the land certificate is issued, and universally explain the democratic government's methods of rewarding the development of water conservancy and improving production, to break the ideological concerns that have not been completely eliminated by some of the masses, and then actively repair and protect waterwheels and wells.

    冀中九专署号召各地组织群众
    趁冬闲修理水车水井
    为明年大生产运动做好准备
    【冀中电】为了打下明年生产基础，恢复与扩大水浇地面积，冀中九专署号召各地发动与组织群众趁冬闲季节修理坏井、坏水车。根据定县统计，及安国、博野等县几个村的具体调查，坏井坏水车很多，定县共有两万四千零七十七眼井，坏的有七千三百五十六眼，占总数的百分之三十点六，水车一万五千七百一十二辆，坏的五千八百一十四辆，占百分之三十点七。又据深泽县刁家庄、北刘庄、北赵庄、大贾庄、安国东王奇、马固、新乐三里铺、博野周庄、李庄等十个村的统计，共有一千零七十二眼井，三百十五辆水车，其中有坏井三百七十八眼，坏水车八十辆。博野屯庄村，七十六眼井坏了三十八眼，二十六架水车，坏了十三架，安国北堡村共有三十架水车，有九架缺斗子，一架缺铁轮，三架缺铁簸箕，综合一个县及十个村的统计，共有井两万五千一百四十九眼，坏了七千七百三十四眼，水车一万六千零二十七架，坏了五千八百九十四架。由于这些坏井坏水车，有的不能浇地，大部也要少浇地，缩小了浇地面积，大大减少了收成，如博野蠡村，边洛凤的井是九家伙着的，因井坏了，少浇二十五亩地。赵进福的水车，十三家伙着的，坏了二十个斗子，没有修理，进福种的一亩半谷子，没有浇，只打了七市斗。和赵进福一样土质的地，刘老考的一亩五分谷子（上了十八车粪，一百斤豆饼，一桶卤，锄了三遍）浇了五水，打了六十三市斗，每亩比赵进福的多打三十一市斗八升。蒋洛廷种的两块谷子，园地浇了四水，每亩上了七车草粪，六筐人粪，一桶卤，打了二十二市斗谷；没有浇水的二亩半，每亩上了八车草粪，三筐人粪，每亩才打谷五市斗。支部书记宋庆兰说：“全村五十八眼井，今年少浇七百二十亩地，平均每井少浇二十六亩，要按蒋老廷浇地与不浇地的产量计算，就少打一万二千二百四十市斗。”据了解，坏井和坏水车的主要原因，是对水车和水井的保护不够，常言说“井怕冻，水车怕碰”，但有许多地方冬天不棚井，也不摘水车，任其损坏。另一原因是伙着井伙着水车和相互借用水车浇地，没有很好的组织教育，都以为反正不是自己的，或不完全是自己的，就不加爱惜，只管使不注意保护和修理，有的甚至在使水车时都不擦油，因为没有很好的组织，有时水车已经坏了也没人带头修理，或不齐心修理，借着使的不愿出钱帮助，原主也索性不加修理。其次，因为缺乏对孩子们的教育管理，不断发生小孩子们的无意破坏。有的在冬天随便弄棚井的柴，有的乱往井里填土扔砖游戏，有的随意糟踏水车等。
    几专署为提高农业生产，保护与修理水车，水井，以恢复与扩大水浇地面积，号召各级领导机关必须重视这一问题，进一步了解坏井坏水车的原因、数目及缩小浇地面积减少收成的情况，以事实教育群众，引导群众组织起来，共同集资修理，或结合副业生产进行修理。对想修理而又确实有困难者，予以贷款帮助。要求凡能修者都在今冬修好，不能拖延；不能修者要领导群众组织起来，从冬季生产中作好明年修理的准备（砖料资金等）。伙井伙水车的，要有领导的齐心修理，借井借水车用的帮助原主修理。并有计划的组织行炉、木匠下乡，组织水车修造厂，配制水车零件。同时注意扶植砖窑，以解决原料技术的困难。加强对水车水井的保护，号召群众冬天一律棚井摘水车，教育儿童不要胡乱破坏，并宣传党的奖励发展生产政策，说明发了土地证后土地不再变动，普遍讲解民主政府奖励发展水利提高生产的办法，以打破部分群众尚未完全肃清的思想顾虑，进而积极修理和保护水车水井。
