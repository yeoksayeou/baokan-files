　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: TASS, Paris dispatch: In view of the British Trades Union Congress Standing Committee's intention to request the World Federation of Trade Unions to cease activities for one year, the Administrative Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a resolution stating: There is no legitimate reason to suspend the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which has remained steadfast to the aims set forth in the charter adopted in 1945. The current difficulties can be overcome as long as the organizations of the various trade unions affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions express goodwill. The resolution regretfully pointed out that the British Trades Union Congress is trying to make the World Federation of Trade Unions follow a policy that is beneficial to the bourgeois government. The Administrative Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor concluded by saying that the international working class shares common interests in terms of its living conditions and the defense of freedom and peace. The French General Confederation of Labor hereby declares that it is determined to ensure the continued existence and development of the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　法国总工会拥护世界工联
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：鉴于英国职工大会常委会意图要求世界工联停止活动一年，法国总工会行政委员会发表一项决议说：要这个对一九四五年通过的章程所揭示的宗旨信守不渝的世界工联停止活动，是没有什么正当理由的。只要世界工联所属各职工会的组织表示善意，目前的各种困难就可以克服。决议遗憾地指出：英国职工大会力图使世界工联遵循有利于资产阶级政府的方针。法国总工会行政委员会结语称，国际工人阶级不论在其生存的条件与保卫自由与和平方面，均是利害与共的。法国总工会兹特宣布：它将决心使世界工联继续存在并开展其活动。
