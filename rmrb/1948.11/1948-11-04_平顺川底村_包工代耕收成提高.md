    Chuandi Village, Pingshun
    Contracting Work and Substituting for Farming Improves Harvests

    Chuandi Village, in the first district of Pingshun, earnestly implemented contracting work and substituting for farming, completing the autumn harvest and autumn plowing for military families and revolutionary martyrs' families ahead of schedule. This year's harvest was above the average yield. The village has a total of ninety-seven households, including seventeen military families and revolutionary martyrs' families. At the beginning of spring, the village cadres and the masses jointly discussed the substitute farming work, and based on the family situation and labor strength of each household, they determined a method of evaluating work based on land, contracting land based on work, and distributing labor based on labor power. The situation of substitute farming before autumn shows that the benefits of this approach are: First, it saves labor. For example, if one mu is evaluated as three work units, two work units can complete the work, and the remaining one work unit belongs to the worker, which rewards labor. Second, it is not limited by time; one can start early or work late as one pleases. Third, military families and revolutionary martyrs' families, in addition to contracting out substitute farming land, cultivate the rest themselves, without relying on others, which also improves their enthusiasm.

    According to the results of each inspection, priority is given to doing work for military families and revolutionary martyrs' families, and most of the work done is first-class. This year's autumn harvest and autumn plowing movement still implemented this method, guaranteeing that the harvest and plowing were completed ahead of schedule. Due to the advantages of substitute farming, this year's harvest for military families and revolutionary martyrs' families is about two large shi (the village's average harvest is between 1.8, 1.9, and 2 shi). For example, Lao Ying (Labor Hero) Guo Yu'enzu's contracted land for Guo Zhishun, a member of a military family, yielded 4.5 shi of grain and 0.6 dou of miscellaneous grains, and 1.4 mu of corn yielded a total of more than 3 large shi.

    平顺川底村
    包工代耕收成提高
    平顺一区川底村认真执行包工代耕，提前完成了军工烈属的秋收秋耕。今年收成在平均产量以上。该村共九十七户，军工烈属共十七户。在开春时，该村干部和群众共同讨论了代耕工作，根据了每户的家庭情况劳力强弱，确定了以地评工，以工包地，以劳力摊工的办法。根据秋前代耕的情况，说明了这种做法的好处是：一、省工。比如一亩评工三个，两个工就能完成活，剩下的一个工是做工者的，这样奖励了劳动力。二、不受时间的限制，想起早想搭黑全由自己。三、军干属除了包出代耕地外，其余全是自己耕种，不靠别人，也提高了积极性。
    据每次检查的结果，都是先给军干属做活，大部分做的都是头等生活。今年秋收秋耕运动中，仍是实行这个办法。保证都提前完成了收耕。由于代耕的好，今年军干属的收成都在两大石左右（全村收成平均在一石八、九到两石）。如劳英郭玉恩祖包代的干属郭芝顺二亩地收谷四石五斗，杂粮六斗，一亩四分玉茭总收三大石多。（长群、之俊、寅卯）
