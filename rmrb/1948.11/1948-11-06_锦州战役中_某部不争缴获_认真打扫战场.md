  　A Certain Unit Did Not Compete for Spoils
  　Conscientiously Clearing the Battlefield
    [Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 4th] Jinzhou News: A certain unit, which made outstanding military achievements in the Jinzhou liberation campaign, responded to the superior's call of "Do not compete for spoils, conscientiously clear the battlefield." In its own security zone, in just four days, it collected more than 600,000 rounds of American-made bullets, more than 800 artillery shells, and more than 4,500 hand grenades discarded by the enemy. The unit recognized that as long as they conscientiously cleared the battlefield in their own security zone, the spoils would not be few. Therefore, they implemented the "Do not compete for spoils with brotherly units" point very well, and won the praise of their superiors.

    【新华社哈尔滨四日电】锦州讯：此次解放锦州战役中战功卓著的某部，响应上级的“不争缴获，认真打扫战场”的号召，在自己的警戒区内，仅四天就收集到敌人遗弃的美造子弹六十余万发，炮弹八百余发，手榴弹四千五百余颗。该部认识了：在自己的警戒区内，只要认真打扫，缴获是不会少的，故对“不与兄弟部队争缴获”一点执行得很好，获得了上级的赞扬。
