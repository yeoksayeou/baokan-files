Xinhua News Agency, North China, 30th - Xu Qichang, former commander of the 66th Division, Major General of the Nationalist Army, Lei Yangtang, former commander of the 37th Division, Major General of the Nationalist Army, and Yan Yingxi, former chief of staff of the 34th Army, Major General of the Nationalist Army and 54 other high ranking captured officers of the Yan Xishan's army in the Officer Training Regiment of the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, jointly published a letter to the officers and soldiers of the isolated city of Taiyuan. They advised the Yan army officers and soldiers that laying down their arms was the only safe way out. The letter said: "In the past, we were deceived by Yan Xishan's propaganda, which said that the People's Liberation Army had thirty-six forms of torture and twenty-four ways to kill, but after we were captured, it was proved that the People's Liberation Army did not insult or kill prisoners. On the other hand, Yan Xishan, in implementing self-confession and rebirth, not only killed countless people, officers, soldiers, and public educators, but also killed thousands of Jin-Sui army officers who had been released by the People's Liberation Army, batch after batch, in Yan Xishan's return-to-dryness corps?"
The letter also said: "You are in the isolated city of Taiyuan. To resist the iron fists of Generals Xu Xiangqian and He Long, who have been through hundreds of battles and are invincible for more than 20 years, is like a mantis trying to stop a chariot. This situation is all bestowed upon you by Yan Xishan. All the deceptive words of Chiang Kai-shek and the American imperialists are nothing more than trying to cheer up Yan Xishan, so that you will be locked to death in the city of Taiyuan and blasted to pieces in the artillery fire. You are trapped in Taiyuan, which has no food or grass inside and no reinforcements outside. The American imperialists' planes are overwhelmed and lack the strength to do what they want. Yan Xishan used to deceive and exploit us in order to make us sell our lives. Now you are already in a cliff-like situation. You have three options: first, defend; second, break out; and third, lay down your arms. Based on our experience, defense and breakout are both impossible. Only laying down your arms is the only safe way and in line with your personal plans. Do not blindly resist, otherwise, we are helpless and powerless. There is a road ahead, choose it yourself."

    徐其昌等致书太原守军
    放下武器是唯一出路
    【新华社华北三十日电】华北军区解放军官教导团中，阎军高级俘官六十六师少将师长徐其昌、三十七师少将师长雷仰汤、三十四军少将参谋长阎应禧等五十七人。顷联名发表致太原孤城中阎军官兵书。劝告阎军官兵只有放下武器，才是安全出路。信中说：“过去我们受到阎锡山的欺骗宣传说：解放军什么三十六刑、二十四杀，但我们被俘后，证明解放军对俘虏确是不辱、不杀。而反看阎锡山在实行自白转生中，不但打死了无数人民、官兵、公教人员，而且连被解放军释放了的晋绥军几千个军官，不也在阎锡山的返干团中一批一批被打死？”
    信中又说：“你们处于太原孤城，要想抵挡二十多年来身经百战所向无敌的徐向前、贺龙两将军的铁拳，不啻是螳螂挡车。这种处境，都是阎锡山恩赐你们的。蒋介石和美帝国主义的一切骗词，无非是想向阎锡山打气，以便把你们死关在太原城内，在炮火里轰得粉身碎骨而已。你们困居于内无粮草外无救兵的太原，美帝国主义的飞机顾此失彼，已心有余而力不足。阎锡山过去欺骗利用我等，无非是要我等卖命。现在你们早已处于崖壁之境。你们有三条路可走，第一守，第二突围，第三放下武器。根据我们经验，守与突围都不可能，只有放下武器是唯一安全与合乎你们个人打算的道路。千万不要盲目抵抗，否则，我们爱莫能助，无能为力也。前头有路，唯自择之。”
