Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: According to various sources, the Kuomintang government's financial deficit in the second half of this year is shockingly large, relying entirely on the excessive issuance of counterfeit gold yuan notes to make up for it. Therefore, the malignant inflation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas will become even more uncontrollable in the future, and the devaluation of the gold yuan and the rise in prices will only intensify.

The Kuomintang government originally set a budget of 9000 trillion legal tender in July, but according to the United Press on October 8, this budget has already been exhausted. Thereupon, the Kuomintang government put forward its so-called "gold yuan budget" after the currency reform. This budget was passed at the Kuomintang government's political affairs meeting on September 22. According to Tianjin's Yishibao, the total expenditure for the second half of this year stipulated in the budget is about 1.8 billion gold yuan, equivalent to 54 million trillion legal tender, a five-fold increase compared with the old legal tender budget in July. However, this figure on paper is still greatly reduced compared with the actual expenditure of the Kuomintang government. According to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing, the pseudo-Premier of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao, once proposed a budget of 920 million US dollars in a secret meeting of the pseudo-Legislative Yuan in July. According to the Kuomintang government's official exchange rate for pseudo-gold yuan, this is equivalent to 3.68 billion yuan. If calculated according to the recent black market price of 20 gold yuan per US dollar, it is equivalent to 18.4 billion gold yuan, or 555.2 million trillion legal tender. This is such an astronomical figure that is shocking and bewildering. This number is 574 times larger than the Kuomintang government's expenditure budget of over 96 trillion in the first half of the year, and 137 times larger than the Kuomintang government's actual expenditure of 4 million trillion in the first half of the year (according to figures from the Kuomintang Ministry of Finance cited by Nanjing's Dagangbao). This means that the Kuomintang's financial expenditure is expanding at an excessive speed after the "currency reform."

More than 80% of this shockingly astronomical financial expenditure belongs to the overspent deficit. Reuters quoted "well-informed sources predicting" that the expenditure of 920 million US dollars "will leave the government with a deficit of 500 million US dollars under the current (referring to July) circumstances. Income for the next six months is estimated to be only half of the total expenditure." On October 18, the Kuomintang government's Minister of Finance, Wang Yunwu, even admitted in a secret meeting of the pseudo-Legislative Yuan: "The financial deficit in the past two months (referring to after the currency reform on August 19) has reached 500 million gold yuan. The originally expected deficit accounted for 46%, but now the deficit has reached 81%." (Agence France-Presse quoted well-informed sources in Nanjing). Based on this calculation, under the circumstances that the economic situation in the Kuomintang area will only continue to deteriorate in the future, at least 745.2 million US dollars of the Kuomintang government's financial expenditure of 920 million US dollars, namely 14.904 billion pseudo-gold yuan (calculated at the black market exchange rate), belongs to the deficit. This number is nearly 150 times larger than the Kuomintang's financial deficit of about 3 million trillion legal tender in the first half of the year (according to news from Kuomintang-controlled newspapers and periodicals). The Kuomintang government's method of making up for this huge deficit is, of course, only to beg for help from the printing press. This is also the real reason why the gold yuan has depreciated rapidly and prices have soared in the past two months and more, and why the speed of their devaluation and rise has even exceeded that of the old legal tender period. When the Kuomintang government implemented the "currency reform," it boasted that the currency reform "could make it possible for the budget of income and expenditure to approach balance." In just two and a half months, this shameless lie has completely fallen through, and even Weng Wenhao had to admit that "the effort to balance the budget has completely failed" (Associated Press Nanjing Electric quoted Weng's speech to the pseudo-Legislative Yuan on the 2nd). Nanjing and Shanghai are now both in shock at the "collapse of the economic front."

　　蒋匪财政开支超速膨胀
  　下半年亏空数目庞大
    【新华社陕北五日电】据各方消息：国民党政府今年下半年财政赤字惊人庞大，要全靠滥发伪金圆券来弥补。因此国民党统治区的恶性通货膨胀今后将益发不可收拾，金圆券的贬值和物价的上涨只会愈加剧烈。
    国民党政府本于七月间订下一个九百万亿法币的预算，但据合众社十月八日消息，这笔预算早已耗尽。于是国民党政府又提出其币改后的所谓“金圆预算”来。该预算已于九月二十二日国民党政府政务会议中通过。据天津益世报消息透露：该预算规定之今年下半年支出总数为十八亿金圆券左右，合法币五千四百万亿，较之七月间的旧法币预算一下子膨胀了五倍。但这个纸面上的数字较之国民党政府实际上的支出还是被大大缩小了的。据路透社南京消息披露：伪行政院长翁文灏七月间曾在伪立法院秘密会议中提出一个为数九亿二千万美元的支出预算。按照国民党政府官价折合伪金圆券，即等于三十六亿八千万元，如按最近的黑市价格美金每元等于二十金圆券计算，则等于一百八十四亿金圆券，折合法币则等于五亿五千二百万亿。这是多么骇人听闻的一个天文学数字。这个数字，较之国民党政府上半年支出预算九十六万余亿，膨胀了五百七十四倍，较之国民党政府上半年实际开支四百万亿（据南京大刚报引国民党财政部数字透露），也膨胀了一百三十七倍。这就是说，“币改”后国民党的财政开支正超速度地膨胀着。
    而这笔骇人听闻的天文数字财政支出，其中百分之八十以上是属于超支的赤字部分的。路透社曾引据“消息灵通方面预计”称：九亿二千万美元的支出在“现在（指七月间）的情况下将使政府有五亿美元的赤字。今后六个月的收入估计仅及总支出的一半。”十月十八日国民党政府财政部长王云五更在伪立法院秘密会议中供认：“过去两月中（指八月十九日币改后）财政亏空已达五亿金圆券。原来预想的赤字占百分之四十六，而现在赤字则已达百分之八十一。”（法新社引据南京消息灵通人士透露）。以此推算，在今后国民党区经济情势只有继续恶化的情形下，国民党政府九亿二千万美元的财政支出中，至少将有七亿四千五百二十万美元即伪金圆券一百四十九亿零四百万（按黑市折算）元系属于赤字部分。该数较之国民党上半年财政赤字法币三百万亿左右（据国民党区报刊消息披露），激剧膨胀了近一百五十倍。国民党政府弥补这笔巨大赤字的办法，当然只有乞灵于印刷机了。这也正是过去两个多月来金圆券迅速贬值和物价飞涨、并使它们贬值和上涨的速度甚至超过了旧法币时期的真正原因。国民党政府实行“改革币制”之初，曾吹嘘说，改革币制“可使收支预算有接近平衡之可能”。仅仅两个半月的时间，这个无耻谎言已彻底破产，连翁文灏也不得不承认“平衡预算的努力已经全部失败”（美联社二日南京电引翁对伪立法院谈话）。南京和上海，现在是都在惊受着“经济战线的崩溃”了。
