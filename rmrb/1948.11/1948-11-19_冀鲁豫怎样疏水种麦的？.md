Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Dispatch: The arduous work of draining water to plant wheat in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region has achieved considerable success. Due to excessive rainfall this autumn, most of the second, third, and seventh districts of Henan, a small portion of the fifth district, and a few counties and districts in Hebei suffered from flooding. Approximately 20,000 hectares were submerged in the entire region. In addition, the Yellow River's water level rose in early October, inundating 11,000 hectares. In total, flooded land accounted for more than one-tenth of the region's cultivated land. Therefore, draining water to plant wheat became the most pressing and arduous task in our region's agricultural production for October. Party, government, and civilian cadres in all flooded areas treated draining water to plant wheat as their central task. In the specific leadership of drainage, the superstitious thinking and conservative, selfish viewpoints of some of the masses, as well as the tailism of certain cadres, became obstacles in the drainage process. Local committees and county committees first broke the tailist tendencies of cadres to "follow the backward," and then cadres went deep to patiently persuade the masses. The following experiences were gained in this work: First, patient persuasion is necessary. When the masses are superstitious about "feng shui" or lack confidence, and persuasion is ineffective, start with a portion first. When the masses see the results, their thinking will be straightened out. Second, regarding historical conflicts among the masses, such as desperate lawsuits over digging into dikes and embankments, persuade the masses on the one hand: Unity and consultation are necessary, and mutual assistance and consideration should be given, according to the principle of diverting small depression water to large depressions, and then finding a way out for large depression water, to achieve everyone being able to eliminate the water disaster. At the same time, earnestly consider the interests of the masses, such as compensating for destroyed crops and excavated land according to output and adjusting and resolving issues. For example, the large depression in Yin Kou and Lang Shan Tun in Jiaxiang County had past conflicts that resulted in deaths and the erection of a monument prohibiting water from the eighteen-mile large depression in Lang Shan Tun from flowing eastward. This time, under the leadership of the government and the education of the masses in Yin Kou, everyone worked together to save hundreds of hectares of land. Third, the drainage work involving two counties or two districts must be unified under consultation. For example, the water south of Lao Tun in the second district of Jiaxiang had to pass through several villages in Jinxiang. The leadership coordinated explanations and compensated the masses whose land was excavated for their losses, so the water flowed out smoothly, and 200 hectares of land could be planted with wheat. In order to unify the leadership of drainage and improve work efficiency, many areas have organized county, district, and village drainage committees or command organizations. In the drainage process, cadres in most areas patiently mobilized, personally took action, and overcame difficulties with a spirit of responsibility to the people. For example, cadres in the seventh district of Chengwu had their legs blistered and bleeding continuously while leading the drainage work, but they did not stop working. The vast majority of cadres in Yunju braved rain and waded through water to mediate disputes. Similar model deeds were seen everywhere. However, there were also very few cadres who, because persuasion was ineffective once or twice, sulked and ignored the situation, or only listened to the opinions of some of the masses without considering the issues comprehensively, resulting in unresolved conflicts and increased difficulties. These were promptly criticized and corrected. With the joint efforts of all our Party, government, and civilian cadres and the masses, incomplete statistics from only six counties in the second, third, and seventh districts show that by October 20, more than 4,666 hectares had been drained, and farmers were planting seeds on these lands. This work is of great significance for expanding wheat planting. Taking Yunju County as an example, which was severely affected by the disaster, statistics from the fourth and fifth districts show that 70 percent of the land has been planted with wheat after drainage. Areas that have not yet been drained are still being drained. In areas submerged by the Yellow River, under the leadership of county and district cadres, efforts are being made to plant as the water recedes. Some are even planting mud-drill wheat. Efforts to rush planting continued until the end of October.

　　冀鲁豫怎样疏水种麦的？
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫区艰苦的疏水种麦工作已获相当成绩。由于今秋雨水过大，河南二、三、七分区大部、五分区少部，以及河北少数县区，均遭水灾，全区被淹没者约二万余顷；再加十月初黄河水涨，淹地一万一千顷，总共被淹土地占全区耕地十分之一以上。因此，疏水种麦为我区十月份农业生产最紧张而艰巨的任务。各被淹地区之党政民干部，均以疏水种麦当做中心工作。在具体领导疏水中，由于一部分群众的迷信思想和保守自私观点，以及某些干部的尾巴主义思想，成为疏水中的障碍，各地委、县委均首先打破干部“随落后走”的尾巴主义倾向，然后由干部深入耐心的说服群众。在这一工作中，得到几点体验：一、必须耐心说服，在群众迷信“风水”或没有信心而又说服无效时，就先从部分做起，群众看到成效，思想也就通了。二、对群众中存在的历史矛盾，如因扒口堤埝拼命打官司等，一面说服群众：要团结协商，互助照顾，根据小洼水引向大洼，大洼水再找出路的原则，求得大家都能排除水患。同时，切实照顾群众利益，如毁庄稼、挖土地，即按产量赔偿土地，调剂解决。如嘉祥县尹口与狼山屯大洼，过去闹矛盾曾打死过人，立了碑，不准狼山屯十八里大洼的水向东流。这次经政府领导，和对尹口群众的教育，大家协力救出土地百顷。三、关系两县、两区的疏水工作，必须协商统一领导。如嘉祥二区老屯南的水，须从金乡几个村过，领导上便协同解释，并赔给被挖地群众损失，水才顺了出去，三千亩地可以种上麦子。许多地区，为了统一领导疏水，提高工作效率，均组织了县、区、村的疏水委员会或指挥机关。在疏水中，大部地区的干部，均以对人民负责的精神，耐心动员，亲自下手，克服困难。如城武七区干部，在领导疏水中，腿上都泡裂了，不断出血，仍不停的工作。郓钜绝大部分干部，冒雨涉水去调解纠纷。诸如此类的模范事迹，到处可见。但也有极少数干部，因为一、二次说服群众无效，即赌气不管了，或者只听信一部分群众的意见，而不全面考虑问题，以致矛盾无法解决，增加困难。这些，都及时受到批评，而得到纠正。在我全体党政民干部与群众共同努力下，仅二、三、七分区六个县的不完整统计，至十月二十日，即已疏水七千顷之多，农民正在这些土地上播种。这一工作，对于扩大种麦意义极大，就郓钜县来看，原水灾极重，经疏水后，四、五区统计，也已种麦达百分之七十。尚未疏完地区，仍在继续疏放。黄水淹没地区，在县区干部领导下，争取水退一片种一片，有的并种泥耧麦。至十月底仍在抢种。
