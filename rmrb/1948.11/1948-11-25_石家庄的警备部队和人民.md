　　The Shijiazhuang garrison troops have correctly implemented the city's policies and earnestly executed the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, resulting in increasingly close relations between the military and the people. During the busy farming seasons of wheat harvesting, autumn plowing, autumn harvesting, and wheat planting this year, the garrison political department promptly issued instructions, and cadres and soldiers actively helped the farmers in the suburbs with their work, achieving great results. During the autumn harvest, one unit alone helped farmers in eight villages including Fantan and Huayuan in the suburbs to harvest 527 mu of crops, transport 144 large carts of manure, and plow 60.8 mu of land, contributing a total of 870 man-days and 212 animal-days, benefiting 223 households. Usually, in the spare time from their busy work and studies, everyone in each unit does mass work. Some units put forward the slogan "Go out of the barracks and unite with the masses," correcting the mistaken notion of some people who thought that "living in the barracks means you don't have to have any contact with the masses." Last winter, after several heavy snowfalls, each unit made a preliminary survey of the elderly, weak, poor, and needy citizens and organized them to help them sweep and carry snow. Some landlords hadn't even gotten out of bed yet, and the snow on the roofs and in the courtyards had already been cleared. Wang Erkui, a poor resident of Wu Lü, Daqiao Street, who made a living by cutting noodles with a machine, was regularly helped by soldiers like Liu Lidong from a certain unit, who came to help him crank the noodle machine and do odd jobs. When the unit moved, Wang Erkui cried with reluctance and finally found the first branch of the Public Security Bureau to request that they publish a commendation for them in the newspaper. When Su Chengrong, a soldier from the Third Squad of a certain unit, accidentally leaked a little water while carrying water for his landlord, he immediately paid for it to be repaired. During the enemy's repeated bombings and harassments, all the officers and soldiers of the garrison troops bravely defended the interests of the people, educated the people about air defense and anti-espionage, and maintained order. On August 21st and 22nd, more than 20 enemy planes indiscriminately bombed Shijiazhuang day and night. The soldiers automatically took care of the goods abandoned by street vendors and transporters and returned them to their owners in the end. On the 22nd, while the enemy planes were still circling in the air, Duan Yuqing, a platoon leader from a certain unit, led his entire platoon to the bombed area to rescue the injured citizens and quickly put out the fire. Sun Liangjian, a platoon leader from a certain unit, and Zhou Chunshan, a squad leader, and six other comrades immediately rushed to the disaster area after the enemy bombing to set up a cordon and, in cooperation with a certain unit, dug out more than a dozen citizens buried in the soil and offered condolences and treatment. An old worker who was rescued said with emotion, "I have been in Shijiazhuang for more than 20 years, and I have never seen such a good team!" From August to October, during several bombings by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, our garrison troops rescued more than 20 citizens, 12 of whom survived after treatment; they also helped the masses dig more than 6,000 meters of air-raid shelters and many air-raid caves.
    During the recent conspiracy by the Chiang Kai-shek-Fu Zuoyi bandits to launch a sneak attack on Shijiazhuang, enemy planes have been harassing the city for days. Our cadres and soldiers have spared no effort to guide citizens in air defense and the elimination of traitors, cover the evacuation of the masses, and guard and patrol day and night. During the enemy bombing on October 30th, Li Baozhu, the company commander of the guard company of a certain unit, led platoon leader Wu Zhiwen, squad leader Yang Shizi, and others, disregarding their own safety, to dig out two victims buried in the soil heap and rescued one of them. Such moving deeds are too numerous to mention. When the Eighth Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Dingzi Hutong, Ningyuan Street, moved, the masses of the street set up tea tables in front of their doors after unsuccessful attempts to persuade them to stay, and followed them all the way to Daqiao Street. Some children parted with them in tears.

　　石家庄的警备部队和人民
    刘恩启
    石家庄警备部队正确贯彻城市政策，认真执行三大纪律，八项注意，使军民关系日益密切。在今年麦收、秋耕、秋收、种麦等农忙季节中，警备政治部均及时发出指示，干部战士积极帮助市郊农民做活，收到很大成绩。秋收中，仅某部即帮助市郊范谈、花园等八个村农民收割庄稼五二七亩，拉粪一四四大车，耕地六○亩八分，共参加人工八七○个，牲口工二一二个，帮助了二二三户。平时，各部在紧张的工作、学习空隙里，人人都做群众工作。有的部队提出“走出营房去，团结群众”的口号，纠正了有些人认为“住了营房可以和群众不发生关系”的错误认识。去年冬天连下几场大雪，各部预先调查了老弱贫苦的市民，有组织的帮助他们扫雪、抬雪，有的房东睡觉还没起，房上院里的雪早就打扫干净了。大桥街五闾贫民王二奎，靠机器切面为生，某部战士刘立冬等经常跑来帮他摇机器切面条，做零碎活。该部移防时，王二奎留恋难舍地哭了，最后找到公安局一分局请求登报表扬他们。某部三班战士苏成荣给房东担水时，不留心把水桶碰漏了一点，自己马上出钱把它补修好了。在敌机历次轰炸袭扰中，警备部队全体指战员英勇地维护人民利益，教育人民防空防特，维持秩序。八月二十一、二十二两日，敌机二十余架日夜滥炸石市，战士们自动把街上摊贩和运输人员扔下的东西看管起来，最后交还本人。二十二日，敌机还在上空盘旋时，某部排长段玉清即率领全排赶到被炸区急救受伤市民，迅速扑灭火灾。某部排长孙良俭、班长周春山等六个同志于敌机轰炸后，立即赶赴灾区警戒起来，并配合某部把埋在土里的十余个市民刨出来，进行慰问救治。一个被救的老工人感动地说：“我在石家庄二十多年，就没见过这样好的队伍！”从八月到十月蒋机数次轰炸中，我警备部队共救出市民二十余人，经救治活命的十二人；并帮助群众挖防空壕六千余公尺，还挖了许多防空洞。
    此次蒋傅匪徒阴谋偷袭石家庄，飞机连日袭扰，我干部战士不遗余力地指导市民防空除奸，掩护群众疏散，昼夜守卫巡逻。十月三十日敌机轰炸时，某部警卫连连长李宝珠带领排长吴志文、班长杨狮子等，奋不顾身，把两个埋在土堆里的受难者挖出来，并救活一名。这样的动人事迹，举不胜举。驻在宁远街丁字胡同的解放军某部八连移防时，该街群众在挽留无效后，门前摆了茶桌，一直赶到大桥街，孩子们有的流着眼泪和他们告别。
