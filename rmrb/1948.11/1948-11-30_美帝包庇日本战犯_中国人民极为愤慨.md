Under the pressure of the world's people, the Far East International Military Tribunal, controlled by American imperialism, announced its verdict the other day after a two-and-a-half-year delay in the trial of twenty-five major Japanese war criminals. The verdict announced the death penalty by hanging for seven people, including Tojo, Itagaki, Hirota, Doihara, Matsui Iwane, Muto Akira, and Kimura Heitaro. The other eighteen major war criminals, whose crimes were notorious, such as Araki Sadao, the instigator of the January 28th Incident, Umezu Mijiro, the former Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army who signed the He-Umezu Agreement, Okamura Yasuji the former commander of the China Expeditionary Army who implemented the "Three Alls Policy," and Hashimoto Kingoro, who participated in the Nanjing Massacre, the executioners of the Chinese people, were only sentenced to life imprisonment, twenty years, or seven years of imprisonment, respectively. The verdict, regarding Emperor Hirohito, who should be responsible for all war responsibilities, ridiculously claimed that he did not agree with the invasion of China plan, thereby exonerating Hirohito's war crimes. Many important war criminals who invaded China, such as Tada Shun, the former supreme commander of the Japanese army in North China, Amau Eiji, who issued the famous declaration of aggression against China, and Ayukawa Gisuke, the famous Zaibatsu who invaded Northeast China, are all at large. After the verdict was announced, Shang Zhen, the head of the Kuomintang reactionary government's mission to Japan, unconditionally expressed his satisfaction first. Of course, this is not surprising, because the Kuomintang traitorous government has long been following its American father, not only shielding war criminals such as Okamura Yasutsugu, but also pinning its hopes on the so-called anti-communist alliance of China, Japan, and South Korea. The Chinese people are satisfied with the sentencing of Tojo and other seven war criminals, but they cannot be satisfied with the other results of this trial. They are particularly indignant at the United States' crimes of shielding, condoning, or arbitrarily releasing a large number of war criminals, sparing no effort to support Japanese militarism, and strangling the Japanese democratic movement.

In the past week, other important international events have been as follows:
(1) Political strike movements are sweeping across India. British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt sent a letter to Indian Prime Minister Nehru, protesting the Indian government's terrorist rule over the Indian working class.
(2) The Communist Party and the Socialist Party of Czechoslovakia have officially merged into a unified working-class party. The Polish Workers' Party and the Socialist Party recently held a joint central plenary meeting to prepare for the merger.
(3) The people of Hungary and Greece warmly celebrated the 30th anniversary of the glorious struggle of the Communist Parties of the two countries.
(4) The Executive Committee of the International Association of Journalists concluded with the complete victory of those who support peace, progress, and freedom of the press.

　　美帝包庇日本战犯
  　中国人民极为愤慨
    在世界人民的督促下，为美帝所控制的远东国际军事法庭对日本二十五名主要战犯的审判，在拖延二年半之久以后始于日前宣布判决书。判决书宣布判处绞刑的，有东条、板垣、广田、土肥原、松井石根、武藤章及木村兵太郎等七人。其他十八名罪恶昭彰的主要战犯，如一二八侵华战争策动者荒木贞夫、签订何梅协定的前关东军参谋长梅津美治郎、执行“三光政策”的前中国派遣军司令＠俊六，以及参与南京大屠杀的桥木欣五郎等中国人民的刽子手，仅分别判处无期徒刑，二十年或七年有期徒刑。判决书对应负一切战争责任的日皇裕仁，竟胡说他不同意侵华计划，借此为裕仁开脱战罪。许多侵华要犯，如前华北日军最高指挥官多田骏，发表有名的侵华声明的天羽英二，侵略东北的著名财阀鲇川义介等，皆逍遥法外。判决书发表后，国民党反动政府驻日代表团团长商震已无条件地首表满意。当然，这并不奇怪，因为国民党卖国政府早经尾随其美国爸爸之后，不仅庇护冈村宁次等战犯，而且正把希望寄托在所谓中日韩反共同盟之上。中国人民对于东条等七名战犯的判决是满意的，但对于这次审判的其他结果则不能满意。对于美国包庇，纵容或擅自释放大批战犯，不遗余力扶植日本军国主义，以及绞杀日本民主运动等等罪行，尤表愤慨。
    过去一周中，国际上其他重要事件如下：
    （一）政治罢工风潮正风行全印。英共总书记波立特致函印总理尼赫鲁，抗议印政府对印度工人阶级的恐怖统治。
    （二）捷克的共产党及社会党，已正式合并为统一的工人阶级政党，波兰工人党与社会党最近已召开了联合的中央全会筹备合并事宜。
    （三）匈牙利与希腊的人民，热烈庆祝两国共产党光荣斗争的三十年纪念。
    （四）国际新闻记者协会执委会在拥护和平、进步与新闻自由人士的完全胜利中宣告结束。
