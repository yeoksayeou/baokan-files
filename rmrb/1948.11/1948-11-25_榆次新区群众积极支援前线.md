　　[Jinzhong Telegram] The broad masses in the newly liberated urban and rural areas of Yuci are actively supporting the Taiyuan front lines. On October 11th and 12th, people from all walks of life in the city, including workers, farmers, merchants, and students, mobilized and registered in two batches, with 2,600 people volunteering to join the war effort. Yang Jin'an, the head of the second lane in North Street, took the lead by having his two sons register for the war, and sent his daughter-in-law to the front to deliver vegetables and provide comfort to the troops. Li Jingjiang from Xiaodongguan didn't have cotton-padded trousers when he left to join the war effort, so Cheng San'er, the street leader, took off his own cotton-padded trousers and gave them to him. Wang Qing, a small merchant from Northwest Guan who made a living selling vegetables, left several jars of bean sprouts at home after leaving to support the front. Ren Xitang, the lane chief, personally carried them out to sell them and wrote a letter telling him to focus on completing his support mission at the front. Dadongguan was organized in advance, and as soon as the order arrived, they set off. Cadres took the lead and rushed to the front lines overnight. When the front lines urgently needed equipment, they transported it overnight despite their fatigue, and continued to transport it the next day. The kiln village workers' company repaired roads under heavy enemy artillery fire. Fu Liangen, a civilian worker from the Sixth District, carried over 80 pounds of ammunition. When others said he couldn't carry it, he said, "What does it matter to suffer a little bit to fight Taiyuan and eliminate Yan Xishan? We'll live a peaceful life after we eliminate Yan Xishan." Workers at Yihua Yarn Factory automatically processed materials during the day and helped the troops repair weapons at night. Since the start of the campaign, workers at Yuci Station have cancelled their regular day and night off to rush the transportation of ammunition and equipment. Students, teachers, and women also automatically support the front. Principals and teachers from Xiaodong Street Elementary School and Beiguan Complete School led students to transport equipment. Qin Xiumei, the women's group leader of the fourth lane in North Street, is a forty-year-old woman with bound feet. She actively helped the street office with war mobilization work. When mobilizing women to deliver grain over short distances, she took the lead in signing up, influencing more than seventy other women to sign up as well. Zheng Yingze, the women's captain of Xiaodongguan, automatically organized all the women in the village to work at the supply station in place of the young and middle-aged men who had left. They found houses, boiled water, cooked meals, transferred the wounded, and helped the supply station grind flour and sew flour sacks for the wounded soldiers. Women from Zhangqing and other villages automatically organized themselves to help the hospital take care of the wounded, wash clothes, and sew quilts. Everyone is united in supporting the Taiyuan campaign.
