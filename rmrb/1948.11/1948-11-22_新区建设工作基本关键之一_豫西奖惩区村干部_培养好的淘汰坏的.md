　　One of the Basic Keys to New District Construction
　　Yuxi Rewards and Punishes District and Village Cadres
　　Cultivating the Good and Eliminating the Bad
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 16th】 Whether district and village cadres are good, whether they can connect with the masses, and how to systematically cultivate good cadres and eliminate bad cadres are one of the basic keys to the construction work in the newly liberated areas. Recently, in the struggle to eliminate and disintegrate bandits in Lushan and Yichuan counties in western Henan, good cadres who relied on the masses, were simple and hardworking, and were brave and tenacious were commended. At the same time, in response to the demands of the masses, some corrupt and degenerate bad cadres who oppressed the people were removed and punished, so that the district and village regimes in the new districts were transformed. Wang Yunting, Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the Sixth District of Lushan, led troops to raid the Daisha Mountain bandit gang, rushed through the line of fire in a fierce battle, completed the task, and demonstrated a spirit of bravery and tenacity. Wang Songgen, head of the district democratic government of the district, coordinated with the troops to suppress bandits in Jiaokou, carried out propaganda along the way, contacted the masses, and grasped reliable intelligence. District cadre Wang Zhongbao worked while ill and went deep among the masses, so he was able to uncover important bandit clues. They were able to master the weapons of criticism and self-criticism and promptly overcome the complacency of the cadres, so they were able to smoothly complete the tasks of disintegrating bandits, summer grain storage, and war service, and cultivate a group of local new cadres. The Lushan County Party Committee and the Democratic Government issued a notice of commendation. However, Zhao Ruhua, the village chief of Yanwangzhuang Village in the Fifth District of Yichuan, spent 20 dan of wheat in just 40 days of work. He spent 150 jin of wheat to escort public grain for ten miles, and he privately used 132 jin of public grain. The village chief of Lumiao Village spent 40 dan of wheat on eating and drinking in one month. Qiao Xiang, the village chief of Fangzhuang Natural Village, was originally a member of the Kuomintang guerrillas. After mixing into the democratic government, he colluded with bandits and impersonated Liberation Army personnel to rob everywhere. He committed 15 cases in four months. In the struggle to eliminate and disintegrate bandits, the local people gained a further understanding of the policies of the democratic government and reported to the democratic government one after another. The government immediately accepted the opinions of the people, conducted investigations, and revoked the position of the village chief of Yanwangzhuang Village, ordering him to compensate the people for their losses and repent to the people; and the government organized a people's court to try the village chief of Fangzhuang Village, Qiao Xiang, according to law. At the same time, the district government also commended some village cadres who were fair, honest, and served the people at mass meetings.

　　新区建设工作基本关键之一
  　豫西奖惩区村干部
  　培养好的淘汰坏的
    【新华社中原十六日电】区村干部好不好，能否联系群众，如何有步骤地培养好干部而淘汰坏干部，是新解放区建设工作中的基本关键之一。豫西鲁山、伊川两县最近在清剿和瓦解土匪的斗争中，表扬了依靠群众，朴实刻苦，英勇顽强的好干部；同时，接受群众要求，撤换与处分了一部分贪污腐化，欺压人民的坏干部，使新区的区村政权得到改造。鲁山六区中共区委书记王云亭带领部队奔袭大晒山股匪，在激烈斗争中冲过火线，完成任务，表现了英勇顽强精神。该区民主政府区长王松根协同部队进剿交口土匪时，沿途进行宣传，联系群众，掌握了可靠情报。区干部王忠保带病工作，深入群众，得以破获重要的土匪线索。他们能够掌握批评与自我批评武器，及时克服干部中的麻痹自满情绪，因而得以顺利完成瓦解土匪、夏季屯粮和战争勤务等任务，并培养出一批本地新干部。鲁山县委和民主政府特予通报表扬。但是，伊川五区燕王庄村长赵汝华，仅参加工作四十天，就开支小麦二十担，一人押送公粮十里路，便开支小麦一百五十斤，他并私自动用公粮一百三十二斤。路庙村长在一个月中，大吃大喝，用去小麦四十担。方庄自然村村长乔祥，原系国民党游击队队员，混入民主政府后，即勾结土匪冒充解放军人员，四出抢劫，四个月中犯案达十五次之多。此次在清剿和瓦解土匪的斗争中，当地人民对民主政府的政策有了进一步的了解，即纷纷向民主政府检举。政府当即接受人民意见，进行调查了解后，分别撤销燕王庄村长，令其赔偿人民损失，向人民悔过；并由政府组织人民法庭，依法审判方庄村长乔祥。同时，该区政府对一些公正廉洁为人民服务的村干部，亦在群众大会上予以表扬。
