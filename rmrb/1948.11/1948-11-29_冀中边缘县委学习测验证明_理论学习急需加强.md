　　Hebei-Central Edge County Committee Study Test Proves
  　Theoretical Study Needs Urgent Strengthening
    [Hebei-Central News] A cadre study test was held at the joint meeting of the county committees in the edge regions of Hebei-Central. Participating were six county committee secretaries, six deputy county committee secretaries, three county committee members, and two district committee members. The test results showed good performance overall. Generally, the basic spirit of various policies related to current work was answered quite well. The overall average was above seventy points, with only three people failing. Comrades Zhang Zhishan and Zhang Gengsheng both scored ninety points.

    The most satisfactory answers were to the questions: "Based on the current conditions in your area, explain how to specifically implement land policies according to the different nature of each region" and "What is empiricism? How can empiricism be overcome?" The average score for both questions was above eighty, with only two people failing the former and everyone passing the latter. This shows that our leading cadres in the edge counties value the mastery of land policies, and the fight against empiricism has also been noted by the leadership.

    The worst answer was to the question: "What issues should we focus on solving first in newly liberated cities and new areas that we can consolidate and occupy?" Half of the participants failed this question. Most neglected the point that "we must resolutely eliminate all reactionary armed forces, dissolve all counter-revolutionary organizations, arrest all resisting elements holding weapons, genuine saboteurs, and counter-revolutionary ringleaders with heinous crimes, and confiscate the property of genuine bureaucratic capitalists and genuine counter-revolutionary ringleaders in order to establish the people's rule." Some only answered "arrest" and "confiscate" without specifying the scope and authority of execution. Some vaguely mentioned "clarifying industrial and commercial policies" or "implementing democratic policies." Some even mistakenly answered: "First solve the people's livelihood problems, mobilize the masses, establish our various organizations, develop the Party, and solve the land problem." Some comrades, while providing acceptable answers in the first half, neglected "protecting law-abiding cultural, religious, industrial, and commercial people and foreigners from infringement" and only vaguely mentioned "stabilizing social order" without specific measures. Some did not mention "retaining law-abiding personnel in cultural and educational institutions and other personnel who can be retained." This shows that many of our comrades have not paid enough attention to studying important documents of the Party Central Committee for a certain period, such as the "Summary of Two Years of War and the Tasks for the Third Year."

    Furthermore, in the test, some comrades did not even know "What is the New Democratic Revolution?" They simply mentioned "anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism" or "uniting all classes against imperialism and feudalism," forgetting about anti-bureaucratic capital. As for who to unite with and who should lead, many people did not answer. This is a major issue within the scope of common knowledge that everyone should know, yet it is still so vague. This shows that the study of theory and the study of Chairman Mao's works is too poor, which should arouse vigilance in the future!

    [Hebei-South News] In order to strengthen cadre study and overcome the lack of organization, discipline, and anarchic state in work, the Third District Committee convened a conference of cadres and general affairs personnel directly under its jurisdiction. After reporting on the victorious situation, the committee conveyed the district committee's supplementary instructions on study and the decision to strictly establish a system for the work and life of the organs. It was reviewed that past studies had not achieved due results due to the lack of tight grip by the leadership and inadequate study methods. It was decided that in the future, sound study committees and study groups should be established at all levels, work should be maintained regularly, responsible cadres of each department must personally participate in the leadership, monthly study plans should be formulated, timely inspections and supervisions should be carried out, and the study situation should be reported to the higher levels on time. Study groups should be divided into three groups, A, B, and C, based on cultural and theoretical level and political experience. The practice of two hours of study and note-taking every day will continue. Finally, the study content was determined according to the level of proficiency. (Xiao Han)

　　冀中边缘县委学习测验证明
  　理论学习急需加强
    【冀中讯】冀中边缘县委联席会上举行干部学习测验，参加的计有县委书记六人，县委副书记六人，县委委员三人与地委委员二人，测验结果，成绩较好。一般对于当前工作中有关的各种政策基本精神，大体上回答的不错。总平均数在七十分以上，仅有三个人不及格，而张之善、张根生两同志答的则均合九十分。
    回答最圆满的，是关于“根据你区当前各方面条件分别说明如何按照不同地区性质，来具体实施土地政策”，与“什么叫经验主义？怎样克服经验主义？”两题，平均分数都在八十以上，前题只有两人不及格，后题全部及格，可见我边缘县主要干部重视对土地政策的掌握，而反经验主义也为领导上注意。
    回答最差的，是“我们可以巩固地占领之新解放城市与新区，首先应着重解决哪些问题？”一题，不及格的竟达半数，大部是忽视了“必须坚决消灭一切反动武装力量，解散一切反革命组织，逮捕一切持枪抵抗分子、真正的破坏分子和罪大恶极的反革命罪魁，没收真正的官僚资本和真正反革命罪魁的财产，以便建立人民的统治”。有的则只答“逮捕”和“没收”而没有范围与执行的权限，有的笼统地提“明确工商政策”，或“贯彻民主政策”，甚或有的竟错误的答成：“首先解决民生问题，发动群众，建立我各种组织，发展党，解决土地问题”。另有一些同志，前半答的虽说及格，但后半忽视“保护守法的文化宗教全体工商业者及外侨不受侵害”，只笼统的提“安定社会秩序”，而缺乏具体措施。有的则未提：“留用文教机关中的守法人员及其他可以留用的人员”。这说明我们不少同志对党中央一定时期的重要文件如“两年战争总结与第三年任务”，在学习上还是不够重视的。
    其次在测验中，竟有同志还不知道：“何谓新民主主义革命”的，只简单提“反帝、反封”或“联合各阶层反帝反封”忘掉还有反官僚资本，至于联合谁？谁来领导，很多人也没有回答。这是人皆应知的，属于普通常识范围的重大问题，竟还如此模糊，这说明学习理论，学习毛主席著作太差了，应引起今后警惕！
    【冀南讯】三地委为加强干部学习克服工作中的无组织无纪律无政府状态，特召开直属机关干部、杂务人员大会，在报告胜利形势后，即传达地委关于学习的补充指示和严格建立机关工作生活制度的决定。检讨到过去的学习，由于领导上抓得不紧，学习方法不够好，没得到应有成绩。确定今后健全各级学委会，学习组，工作要保持经常，各部门负责干部必须亲自参加领导，每月制定学习计划，及时检查督促，并按时向上级汇报学习情况。学习小组，应以文化理论程度，政治经验为标准，编成甲、乙、丙三组。继续坚持每天两小时学习和记笔记。最后分别程度确定了学习内容。（萧寒）
