Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 27th: Reports from various sources: The French Communist Party issued a statement on the 23rd regarding the decision by the United States and Britain to return the Ruhr industrial region to Nazi monopoly capitalists, pointing out that returning the Ruhr's heavy industry to the Nazi tycoons would endanger French security and world peace. The statement reiterated the call to organize a democratic coalition government, reaffirming the guarantee made by French Communist leaders in every recent speech, namely that the French people will never go to war against the Soviet Union.

To alleviate the French people's anger over the Ruhr decision, the French government submitted a so-called "memorandum" on the Ruhr issue to the US and British governments. However, the US and Britain completely ignored it. US Acting Secretary of State Lovett publicly stated that the US and British decision was "necessary to accelerate European recovery." Marshall and McNair also rejected the French plan to revise German policy during their meeting with Schuman in Paris on the 20th. Agence France-Presse reported news from Parisian newspapers that Marshall, before returning to the United States on the 21st, instructed General Clay, the US military governor in Germany, to continue all plans for the division of Germany, regardless of French protests.

The French Communist Party's newspaper "L'Humanité" pointed out in an editorial on the 16th that the US-British decision to re-cartelize the Ruhr was a direct and inevitable result of the Marshall Plan. The editorial continued, "The French warmongers must choose: if they do not abandon their 'plan,' they expose the extreme hypocrisy of their protests to the US and Britain."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 23rd: Paris Dispatch: The Central Committee Plenum of the French Communist Party, which convened on the 15th and 16th, has concluded. In a resolution passed on the 16th, the French Communist Party's Steering Committee protested against the United States and Britain for violating the principle of the four powers jointly handling the German issue and unilaterally "returning the Ruhr arsenal to Hitler's tycoons." The resolution pointed out that this decision, which endangers French security, has "removed the charitable mask of the Marshall Plan." French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez delivered a speech on the 18th, condemning the French ruling class for preparing for a new war by implementing the Marshall Plan. Thorez pointed out that more and more French people are now linking the Marshall Plan with the difficulties France is currently experiencing. "The masses of the people now have the feeling that the Marshall Plan means sacrificing French interests, eliminating French industry, and ending France's due reparations in order to formulate a war plan. This plan has already cost us 450 billion francs in military spending, a figure far exceeding the 'aid' given to us by the United States." When Thorez spoke of the prospect of the great battle for peace and national independence to be waged tomorrow, he pointed out: "The working class and the Republic have every possibility of victory." Finally, Thorez announced that the next National Congress of the French Communist Party would be held in February next year, at which the future of the workers and the future of France would be discussed in the broadest terms.

　　法共抗议鲁尔还德
  　谴责政府叛卖法国利益
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】各方报导：法国共产党对美英决定将鲁尔工业交还纳粹独占资本家一事，于二十三日发表声明，指出鲁尔重工业的交还纳粹大亨们，将危害法国安全与世界和平。声明再次号召组织民主联合政府，重申法共领袖们在最近每一次演说中都提出的保证，即法国人民决不去对苏作战。
    为缓和法国人民对于鲁尔决定的愤怒情绪，法国政府又向美英政府提出关于鲁尔问题的所谓“备忘录”。但美英一律置之不理。美代理国务卿罗维特公开声明，美英之决定为“加速欧洲复兴所必需”。马歇尔及麦克奈尔于二十日在巴黎与舒曼的会谈中，亦拒绝法方修改对德政策的计划。电通社报导巴黎各报消息，马歇尔在二十一日返美前曾训令驻德美军总督克莱，不顾法国抗议继续按照分割德国计划进行一切。
    法共机关报“人道报”在十六日社论中指出，重新使鲁尔卡特尔化的美英决定，是马歇尔计划的直接和必然的结果。社论继称，“法国计划战争的党徒们必须抉择，他们不放弃他们的‘计划’，就是暴露了他们对美英提出抗议的极度虚伪性。”
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】巴黎讯：法共中央全会于十五、十六两日集会以后已宣告闭幕。法共指导委员会在十六日通过之决议中，抗议美英两国违背四强共同处置德国问题原则，擅自将“鲁尔兵工厂交还给希特勒的大亨们”。决议指出，这一危害法国安全的决定已“除下了马歇尔计划的慈善的假面具”，法共总书记多列士十八日发表演说，谴责法国统治阶级在奉行马歇尔计划准备新战争。多列士指出：现在法国人民把马歇尔计划与目前法国所经受的困难联系起来看的人已经越来越多了。“人民群众现在有这种感觉：就是马歇尔计划即意味着牺牲法国利益，消除法国工业，终止法国应得的赔偿以制订一个战争计划。这个计划已经使我们用去四千五百亿法郎的军费，这个数字，远超出于美国所给予我们的‘援助’”。多列士说到将在明天为和平与国家独立而进行的伟大战斗的远景时指出：“工人阶级和共和国有胜利的一切可能性”。最后，多列士宣布法国共产党下届全国大会决定于明年二月举行，届时，对工人的未来和法国的未来，将作最广泛的讨论。
