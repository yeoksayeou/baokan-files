Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. The policy of US imperialism to arm the Kuomintang bandit gangs with massive amounts of military supplies to launch and conduct a counter-revolutionary civil war in China, attempting to eliminate the People's Liberation Army by force, has suffered a shameful defeat. This fact can be fully demonstrated by the following statistics of the Kuomintang’s American-equipped and semi-American-equipped forces annihilated by the People's Liberation Army. From the Japanese surrender until October of this year, according to the current Kuomintang organization, the US imperialists equipped the Kuomintang with the following quantities of troops: First, those entirely American-equipped totaled 29 regular armies, or 69 divisions. Adding 14 regular divisions not belonging to the aforementioned 29 armies, the total amounts to 83 divisions. In addition, there are five rapid columns and eighteen traffic police corps (all equivalent to divisions), totaling 106 divisions. Second, semi-American-equipped troops totaled four armies, or 11 divisions. In the two years and four months of the People's Liberation War, up to the liberation of Shenyang on November 2nd of this year, among the Kuomintang’s entirely American-equipped regular forces, 59 divisions have been completely annihilated by our army, namely: the 89th Division of the 13th Army, the 80th Division of the 28th Army, the 79th Division of the 49th Army (annihilated three times), the 105th Division (annihilated twice), the 2nd Division and 25th Division of the 52nd Army (annihilated twice), the 116th Division of the 53rd Army (annihilated twice), the 130th Division, the Provisional 30th Division, the 182nd Division of the 60th Army (revolted), the 184th Division (annihilated twice, revolted once), the Provisional 21st Division (annihilated once, revolted once), the Provisional 52nd Division (revolted), the 87th Division, 88th Division (annihilated four times), and 91st Division of the 71st Army (annihilated twice), the 51st Division and 58th Division of the 74th Army, the 43rd Division of the 94th Army, the 19th Division (annihilated twice) and 44th Division (annihilated twice) of the 100th Army, the New 30th Division, 50th Division, and Provisional 53rd Division of the New 1st Army, the 14th Division, 54th Division, and Provisional 59th Division of the New 3rd Army, the 26th Division and Provisional 58th Division (revolted) of the New 5th Army, the 169th Division and New 22nd Division of the New 6th Army, the New 38th Division, Provisional 56th Division, and Provisional 61st Division (all surrendered) of the New 7th Army, the Provisional 54th Division and Provisional 55th Division of the New 8th Army, the 1st Brigade, 2nd Brigade, and 3rd Brigade of the 207th Division, the 41st Division, the 49th Division, the 57th Division (annihilated twice), and the 195th Division (annihilated twice). In addition, 55 regiments have been annihilated entirely; calculated at three regiments per division, this equates to more than 18 divisions, totaling 77 divisions. Of the 18 traffic police corps, four have been completely annihilated. Of the existing five rapid columns, one entire regiment has been annihilated (the 1st and 2nd Rapid Columns have both been annihilated once, already counted among the regular divisions). As for the semi-American-equipped troops, seven divisions have been entirely annihilated, namely: the 1st Division of the 1st Army, the 15th Division (annihilated twice), the 77th Division (annihilated twice), the 32nd Division, and the 193rd Division of the 73rd Army. In addition, four regiments have been annihilated entirely. Looking at the number of annihilations year by year, taking the entirely American-equipped regular army as an example, 15 entire divisions were annihilated in the first year (July 1946 to June 1947), 9 entire divisions were annihilated in the second year (July 1947 to June 1948), and in the first four months of the third year (July 1948 to October 1948), as many as 35 entire divisions have already been annihilated, more than one and a half times the total number of divisions annihilated in the two previous years combined. Among these annihilated regular American-equipped divisions, ten divisions were annihilated twice, one division was annihilated three times, and one division was even annihilated four times. The New 1st Army and New 6th Army, which have always been touted as the "most elite" by US imperialism and the Kuomintang propaganda organs, and the New 3rd Army and New 7th Army, formed by drawing key troops from these two armies, were all completely wiped out in our army's autumn offensive of the third year of the war.

　　美帝武装蒋匪侵华政策遭可耻失败
    蒋匪美械半美械部队已被消灭八十九个师
    【新华社陕北十六日电】美帝国主义以大量军火武装国民党匪帮在中国发动与进行反革命内战，企图武力消灭人民解放军的政策，已遭受到可耻的失取。这个事实，从下述国民党美械部队民半美械部队被人民解放军歼灭的统计中，可以得到充分的证明。从日本投降以后到今年十月为止，按照国民党现在的编制，美帝国主义为国民党共装备了下述数量的军队：第一、全部美械者，计有二十九个正规军，以师计则为六十九个师，加上不属于上述二十九个军之十四个正规师，则共合为八十三个师。此外尚有五个快速纵队与十八个交警总队（均等于师），合计应为一零六个师。第二、半美械者四个军，共十一个师。在两年又四个月的人民解放战争过程中，截至本年十一月二日沈阳解放为止，国民党的全部美械化正规部队中，被我军整师地歼灭过五十九个师，即十三军八十九师，二十八军八十师，四十九军七十九师（被歼三次）、一零五师（被歼两次），五十二军二师、二十五师（被歼两次），五十三军一一六师（被歼两次）、一三零师、暂三十师，六十军一八二师（起义）、一八四师（被歼两次，起义一次）、暂二十一师（被歼一次，起义一次）、暂五十二师（起义），七十一军八十七师、八十八师（被歼四次）、九十一师（被歼两次），七十四军五十一师、五十八师，九十四军四十三师，一百军十九师（被歼两次）、四十四师（被歼两次），新一军新三十师、五十师、暂五十三师，新三军十四师、五十四师、暂五十九，新五军二十六师、暂五十八师（起义），新六军一六九师、新二十二师，新七军新三十八师、暂五十六师、暂六十一师（均投诚），新八军暂五十四师、暂五十五师，二零七师第一旅、第二旅、第三旅，四十一师，四十九师，五十七师（被歼两次），一九五师（被歼两次）。此外整团地被歼灭过五十五个团；以三个团合一个师计算，折合为十八个多师，共合为七十七个师。其十八个交警总队中，有四个被全歼过。其现有之五个快速纵队中，被歼灭过一个整团（其第一与第二两快速纵队均曾被歼过一次，已在正规师中计算）。至于半美械部队则被整师地歼灭过七个师，即第一军第一师，七十三军十五师（被歼两次）、七十七师（被歼两次）、三十二师、一九三师。此外，整团地被歼灭过四个团。如以逐年被歼灭的数量来看，以全部美械正规军为例，第一年（一九四六年七月至一九四七年六月）被歼十五个整师，第二年（一九四七年七月至一九四八年六月）被歼九个整师，而第三年的头四个月（一九四八年七月至十月）即已被歼三十五个整师之多，比两年被歼师数的总和还多二分之一。这些被歼的正规美械师中，有十个师被歼两次，一个师被歼三次，有一个师甚至被歼四次。一向被美帝国主义及国民党宣传机关鼓吹为“最精锐”的新一军与新六军，及由这两个军抽出基干部队组成的新三军与新七军都已在战争第三年的我军秋季攻势中全军覆没。
