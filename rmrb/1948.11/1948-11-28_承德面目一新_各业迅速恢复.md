Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 25th -- Since the liberation of Chengde City, the capital of Rehe Province, revolutionary order has been rapidly established, and the entire city has taken on a new look. The People's Liberation Army and the People's Government were warmly welcomed by the citizens upon entering the city. The people of Chengde also automatically collected firearms from scattered Kuomintang soldiers and handed them over to the government. Slogans such as "Welcome the People's Liberation Army!" "Support the Communist Party!" and "Support the People's Government!" are plastered all over the city. When the Kuomintang army fled, it engaged in large-scale looting. More than 40 employees of the telephone and telegraph bureaus voluntarily organized themselves to protect all equipment with arms. Chengde Men's High School, Teachers' College, and other schools also organized school protection committees, so that all equipment was undamaged. The city's postal services have now been restored, and all schools will resume classes within days. The largest newspaper in the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning area, "Masses Daily," is now being distributed in the city and is very popular with readers. All stores have reopened.
