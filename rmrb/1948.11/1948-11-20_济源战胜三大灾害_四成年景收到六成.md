　　[Taiyue Electric] Jiyuan overcame three major disasters and achieved a 60% harvest. At the beginning of spring, the county faced a spring famine. Of the 27,000 households here, many were short of food, and some had nothing to eat at all, causing widespread anxiety. Kong Huiyuan from Kongzhuang said, "This year, I fear it will be worse than the famine of 1944." To lead the masses in fighting the disaster, the county not only distributed 10,000 *shi* of grain and provided 60 million yuan in loans but also quickly organized the masses to engage in production to overcome the famine. For example, Kong Xiangyun, the village head of Kongzhuang, convened a mass meeting to discuss ways of self-salvation through production. After the meeting, 15 middle-peasant households and 56 poor-peasant households pooled 230,000 yuan to open an oil pressing workshop; Kong Fanli and others organized 12 households to engage in transportation and peddling; the whole village was involved in a self-salvation through production movement. Kong Fanli earned 300,000 yuan in just over a month. In a little over a month, the entire village of 138 households earned more than 110 *shi* of grain, solving the severe spring famine. Other disaster-stricken villages also overcame the difficulties in the same way, and then started spring plowing, along with carrying out work to correct deviations. According to statistics from 28 villages in the Second District, men and women, young and old, all went to the fields and weeded the first time the autumn seedlings in three days. However, after entering July, they encountered floods, and many villages' fields and seedlings were submerged. The county then led the masses to fight the floods. Villages such as Daxu immediately convened villagers' meetings to discuss solutions, proposing "It floods, we drain," and decided to dig drainage ditches. Village cadres Meng Shutang and Duan Fatai personally led the digging of three drainage ditches, saving more than 370 *mu* of autumn crops; they also helped Cheng Village save more than 300 *mu* and Dongxu Village 200 *mu*. Cadres in Dongxu Village also led everyone in digging a drainage ditch of more than 200 *zhang* long, saving another 200 *mu* of autumn crops. However, some land could not be drained, so it was decided to plant vegetables in the autumn to increase income. In August, an epidemic struck, affecting 138 villages out of 117 villages in the county, with some villages particularly severely affected. For example, in Lilin, out of 320 people in the entire village, 317 were ill, and there was no one to go to the fields or even cook. At this time, the county and district governments quickly organized doctors to provide treatment and sent cadres to severely affected areas to offer condolences and relief, allocating more than 20,000 *jin* of grain specifically to help poor people get medical treatment. As a result, the number of patients in various villages gradually decreased. Epidemic prevention work was also carried out in unaffected areas to prevent the spread of the epidemic. At the same time, some places also experienced cattle plague, and democratic governments at all levels organized veterinarians to treat the cattle, curing more than 500 heads in total, and proposed measures to protect livestock. Due to the active leadership in fighting various disasters, many autumn crops were weeded three times, and most were weeded twice. According to the disaster situation, only 30% to 40% could be harvested, but through the efforts of all parties, a 60% harvest was finally achieved.

　　济源战胜三大灾害
    四成年景收到六成
    【太岳电】济源战胜了三大灾害，争取到六成收。开春时，该县就遇到春荒。这里的二十七的户口，当下缺吃，一部分群众当时就没吃的。形成人心惶惶。孔庄孔会元说：“今年怕比三十三年灾荒还怕人”。该县为领导群众与灾害开展斗争，除及时发放贷粮一万石，贷款六千万元外，并迅速组织群众生产渡荒。如孔庄村长孔祥运召开了全村群众大会，共同讨论生产自救的办法，会后就有十五户中农、五十六户贫农，凑合了资本二十三万元开榨油坊榨油；孔凡礼等又结合了十二家出外担贩运输；全村卷入了生产自救运动。孔凡礼一个多月就赚了三十万元。一个多月全村一百三十八户，就收入一百一十多石粮食，解决了严重的春荒。其他各受灾村也同样渡过了难关。接着就动手春耕。同时进行了纠偏，大家更有了心劲。据二区二十八个村统计，男女老少一齐上地，三天就锄完了头遍秋苗。但进入七月以后，又遇到水灾，不少村庄田苗被淹没。该县遂又领导群众与水灾作斗争。大许等村立刻召开村民大会讨论办法，提出：“它淹我泄”，决定挑泄水沟。村干部孟书棠、段法太亲自领导挑泄水沟三条，救出了三百七十多亩秋禾；并且还帮助程村救出了三百多亩，东许村二百亩。东许村干部也领导大家挑了二百多长的泄水沟，又救出了二百多亩秋禾。但仍有些地无法泄水，决定入秋后改种蔬菜，争取增加收入。八月间又遭遇了瘟疫，全县一百一十七村，有瘟疫的就有一百三十八村，个别村子特别严重。如梨林全村三百二十口人，就有三百一十七人有病，不但没人上地，连作饭的人也没有了。这时县、区政府就急速组织医生医治。并派出干部到瘟疫严重地区进行慰问与救济，拨粮二万多斤专门帮贫苦人治病，这样各村病人逐渐减少了。在没病地区也进行了防疫工作，以阻止瘟疫蔓延。同时有些地方还发生了牛瘟，各级民主政府，另组织兽医到各地医治，共治好五百多头。并提出了保护牲畜的办法。由于积极领导群众与各种灾害进行斗争，所以使不少秋禾锄了三遍，大部分锄了二遍。按照灾害情况只能收三、四成，但经各方面努力终于争取到六成收成。
