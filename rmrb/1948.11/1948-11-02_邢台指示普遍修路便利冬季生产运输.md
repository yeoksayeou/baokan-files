    [Taihang News] In order to carry out winter production and facilitate mass transportation, the Xingtai County Government issued a circular to all districts in the county on October 20, requiring them to mobilize the masses to universally repair the county's main roads and cart roads between the 22nd and 25th days of the ninth lunar month. The circular specifically put forward the following points: Areas along the motor roads should repair the motor roads along the route. Areas not along motor roads, such as the seven districts of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, in addition to repairing the ordinary main roads to make them suitable for livestock, the original cart roads (especially the cart road from Songjiazhuang to Xingtai City) should also be repaired to allow carts to pass. Bridges should be built where necessary, and piles should be built where needed.

    When repairing, in addition to repairing the roads belonging to each village, the general main roads must be repaired to connect village to village. For some difficult-to-repair main roads that require excessive labor, most villages can be mobilized to repair them together. When repairing roads, each village and each section must select a person in charge to lead, so as to avoid wasting labor.

    After the general repair of roads in each district, strict protection should be implemented. In particular, the motor roads within the territory of the first, second, third, and fourth districts should be protected section by section according to the villages along the road. Iron-wheeled vehicles are not allowed to pass, and repairs should be carried out at any time when damage occurs.

    邢台指示普遍修路便利冬季生产运输
    【太行讯】为了开展冬季大生产，便利群众运输，邢台县政府于十月二十日通令全县各区，要在古历九月二十二至二十五日中间，动员群众将全县大路汽路普遍补修。该通令并具体提出以下几点：沿汽路地方，修理沿线汽路，未沿汽路地方，如五、六、七、八、九、十、十一七个区，除将普通大路修的好走牲口外，原有大车路（特别是宋家庄至邢市之大车路），也要修好能行大车。该搭桥者搭桥，需垒桩者垒桩。
    在修的时候，除修属各村之路外，一般的大路必须修的村与村接住，一些难修之大路，用工过多者，可动员多数村共同补修。在修路时各村各段一定要选负责人领导人，以免浪费工。
    各区道路普修后，应严加保护，特别一、二、三、四区境内之汽路，应按沿路之村庄，分段保护，不准铁轮车通行，随时坏了，随时补修。
                                              （景义）
