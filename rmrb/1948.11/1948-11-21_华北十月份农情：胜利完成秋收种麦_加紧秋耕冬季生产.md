　　North China's October Agricultural Situation:
    Victory in Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting; Stepping up Autumn Cultivation and Winter Production
    In October, North China's agricultural production victoriously completed the autumn harvest and wheat planting, and has shifted to autumn cultivation and preparations for winter production.
    From September to the end of October, the autumn harvest and wheat planting in various regions were successively completed. The average yield for the entire region's autumn harvest was 70%, with some areas in Taihang, Taiyue, and Beiyue celebrating bumper harvests. The average yield in the Taiyue region was 80%, with various autumn crops yielding an average of one *shi* per *mu*. Compared to the average annual output after the war, the yield increased by an average of 8.8 *he* per *mu*, resulting in an increase of over 600,000 *shi* of grain in the entire region, reaching over 80% of the pre-war average annual output. In Yangshu Village, Yangcheng, millet yielded 1.25 *shi* per *mu* last year, and 1.6 *shi* per *mu* this year, an increase of 3.5 *dou* per *mu*. Corn yielded 0.75 *dou* per *mu* last year, and 1.06 *shi* per *mu* this year, an increase of 2.56 *dou*. In Shili Village, Huguan, Taihang, due to the increased enthusiasm of the masses for production, the widespread implementation of intensive cultivation resulted in an increased output of over 700 *shi*, with half of the households in the village having surplus grain. The "811 Millet" in Licheng and other places achieved a bumper harvest this year, with an average yield of three *shi* per *mu*. Even in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, which experienced frequent warfare, heavy war duties, and severe disasters, a yield of 60% was achieved. Significant progress was also made in wheat planting. According to statistics from eight counties in central Hebei, including Xianxian, Xianjiao (a new county formed from parts of Xianxian and Jiaohe), Renqiu, Anping, Wuqiang, Shulu, Ningjin, and Jinxian, a total of 879,000 *mu* of wheat was planted, accounting for over 28% of the cultivated land area. Anping County alone planted 90,360 *mu* more than last year. The successful completion of the autumn harvest and wheat planting was not only due to the publicity of policies and the raising of the masses' enthusiasm for production, but also due to the appropriate resolution of the following issues: Firstly, overcoming the spontaneous thinking that production does not need leadership. For example, Cixian and other places seized the production season, suspended the land reform, and led the masses in autumn planting. In many counties and districts in central Hebei, cadres adopted the method of leading production by participating in production, gradually deepening the leadership of production work. Comrade Wu Xingren, Secretary of the Xingtai County Committee in Taihang, even went deep into the mutual aid groups to personally help the masses solve various difficulties in wheat planting. Due to the strengthening of leadership, phenomena such as forced organization of mutual aid, blindly launching challenges, simply pursuing figures, and holding meetings regardless of the busy farming season were also corrected. Special attention was paid to solving various difficulties faced by the masses in harvesting and planting. For example, production promotion cooperatives in various counties in central Hebei prepared fertilizers and seeds, and helped the masses buy livestock, which greatly increased the masses' enthusiasm for production. In Fan Village and 27 other villages in Zhaoxian, central Hebei, middle peasants alone bought 900 *dan* of manure and 8,630 *jin* of bean cake for wheat planting this year, an unprecedented phenomenon in the past decade. Secondly, agricultural mutual aid was greatly restored and developed during the harvest and planting seasons. Small-scale mutual aid groups were organized everywhere in Taihang, central Hebei, southern Hebei, and Taiyue. In Jinxian, 508 new mutual aid groups were developed in 59 villages in seven districts. In Daqudi and other villages in Lixian, the proportion of households voluntarily organizing reciprocal labor mutual aid accounted for 30% of the total number of households. Due to the different specific needs of the masses, the forms of mutual aid organizations were also diverse, including: shared livestock, labor exchanged for animal power, human labor mutual aid for pulling plows and seeders, female labor exchanged for male labor, light work exchanged for heavy work, brothers working together after dividing the family property, and relatives and friends helping each other. In organizing large numbers of small-scale mutual aid groups in Taihang, centralized leadership was implemented, and groups were coordinated with each other to overcome labor and livestock difficulties, achieving the goal of calculating time, arranging life, and rationally using labor based on actual conditions, thereby improving labor efficiency. In mutual aid organizations, special attention was paid to the participation of women, children, and the elderly, achieving the goal of women harvesting and men carrying, women collecting and men cultivating, and rational division of labor. In Qiangen Village, Zanhuang County, the entire autumn harvest was completed in ten days due to the participation of women and children. Thirdly, attention was paid to technical guidance. This year, cadres from agricultural and forestry departments in Taiyue, Beiyue, and central Hebei went to the countryside to help the masses select seeds, disinfect them, and promote superior varieties. The "72" wheat variety was widely sown in the Beiyue region. In addition, multiple plowing and manuring were promoted. Most districts and villages in Licheng, Taihang, plowed three times before sowing. Fourthly, in the waterlogged areas of central Hebei and Hebei-Shandong-Henan, great efforts were made to drain water and plant wheat. According to statistics from six counties in the second, third, and seventh sub-districts of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 7,000 *qing* of land had been drained by October 20th, and 1,400 *qing* of land in Baiyangdian, central Hebei, had also been drained and planted with wheat. Fifthly, in the border areas of northern Henan in Taihang, southern Henan along the Yellow River in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the north of the Daqing River in central Hebei, and western Pingxi in Beiyue, past experience was used to combine labor and military affairs, implementing the principle of "harvesting one piece, cultivating one piece, and planting one piece" to complete the rush harvest and rush planting, smashing the enemy's sabotage conspiracy.
    In October, various regions have successively shifted from autumn harvesting and wheat planting to autumn cultivation. Southern Hebei and Hebei-Shandong-Henan are striving to plow all the bare land before the ground freezes, with particular emphasis on areas that have experienced drought and insect plagues. Changzhi and other counties in Taihang started earlier, and villages with better leadership completed autumn cultivation in mid-October. Huailai and other counties in Beiyue have no autumn cultivation habits, and the leadership is vigorously promoting autumn cultivation to kill insects and prevent drought, and the masses have also begun autumn cultivation. The most serious difficulty encountered by various regions in autumn cultivation is the mobilization and organized use of livestock. The solution in Xiyang and other counties in Taihang is to appropriately increase livestock wages on the one hand, and clear outstanding wages on the other hand, so that households with livestock do not suffer losses. The task of supporting the front in central Shanxi is heavy, and many places organize people to pull plows and dig the ground, which has also solved some problems. Secondly, some of the masses still have the idea of waiting for the equal distribution or subsidy of land, fearing that they will be cultivating for nothing. Various regions are carrying out policy publicity to address this thinking. The above issues are being resolved.
    In addition, preparations for the development of winter production are also underway in various parts of North China. Leading organs in Taihang, Beiyue, central Hebei, southern Hebei, and Hebei-Shandong-Henan have formulated winter production plans, emphasizing the development of various sideline productions, and requiring various regions to formulate recovery and development plans based on local production conditions and characteristics. Sufficient capital and necessary conditions are also being prepared for next year's large-scale production, calling on the masses to repair and add waterwheels and agricultural implements in winter, dig wells, build pig pens, and accumulate a lot of fertilizer. Agricultural mutual aid organizations that have developed in agricultural production should be transformed into cooperatives engaged in sideline production in winter. In ending the land reform and party rectification, the production time of the masses must be taken into account. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan region also issued loans of 2.803 billion yuan and 3.05 million *jin* of wheat to assist the masses in winter production.

　　华北十月份农情：
    胜利完成秋收种麦　加紧秋耕冬季生产
    华北十月份农业生产，胜利完成了秋收种麦，并已转入秋耕和准备冬季生产等工作。
    从九月开始至十月底，各地秋收种麦先后均告完成，全区秋收平均七成年景，太行、太岳和北岳若干地区并庆丰收。太岳全区平均八成年景，各种秋禾平均每亩收一石，与战后常年产量相较，每亩平均增产八升八合，全区约增产粮食六十余万石，达战前常年产量百分之八十强。阳城阳恕村，谷子去年每亩收一石二斗五，今年收一石六斗，每亩增产三斗五升。玉茭去年每亩收七斗五，今年收一石零六合，增产二斗五升六合。太行壶关十里村，由于群众生产情绪的提高，普遍实行精耕细作，增产达七百余石，全村二分之一的户均有余粮。黎城等地的“八一一谷”，今年普获丰收，每亩平均收三石。即战争频繁、战勤较多、灾情较重、地质较差的冀鲁豫区，亦获得六成收成。种麦亦获很大成绩，据翼中献县、献交（新县，献县、交河各一部）、任邱、安平、武强、束鹿、宁晋、晋县等八县统计，共种麦八十七万九千亩，占耕地面积百分之二十八以上，安平一县即较去年多种九万零三百六十亩。能胜利完成秋收种麦，除了宣传政策，提高群众生产情绪外，还由于适当的解决了下列问题：首先是克服了认为生产不用领导的自流思想。如磁县等地抓紧生产季节，暂停结束土改，领导群众秋种。冀中不少县区干部，采取了以参加生产来领导生产的方法，使生产工作的领导逐渐深入。太行邢台县委武兴仁同志更深入互助组，亲自帮助群众解决种麦的各种困难。由于领导的加强，也纠正了强迫组织互助，盲目发动挑战，单纯追求数目字，不顾农忙老开会等现象。特别解决了群众收种中的各种困难，如冀中各县生产推进社，准备肥料种子，帮助群众买牲口等，因此，群众生产情绪很高。冀中赵县范村等二十八村仅中农，今年种麦共买了九百担大粪，八千六百三十斤豆饼，为十年来所未有的现象。其次是农业互助在收种中得到很大恢复与发展，太行、冀中、冀南、太岳等地，到处组织小型互助，晋县七个区五十九村，新发展了五百零八个互助组。蠡县大曲堤等村，自动组织拨工互助的，占全体户数百分之三十。因群众有各种不同的具体需要，互助组织形式亦多种多样，计有：牲口合犋、人力换畜力、人力互助拉犁拉耧、女工换男工、轻活换重活，兄弟分家而合伙作活、亲朋串忙等。太行在大量组织小型互助中，实行集中领导，组与组互相调剂，以克服劳畜力困难，达到从实际出发去计算时间、安排生活与合理使用劳力，因而提高了劳动效率。在互助组织中，特别注意妇女儿童老汉参加，做到女割男担、女收男耕，合理分工；赞皇县千根村由于妇女儿童参加，十天完成了全部秋收。第三，注意了技术指导。今年太岳、北岳、冀中等地农林处干部普遍下乡，帮助群众选种、消毒，推广优良品种；北岳区大量播种“七二”小麦。此外提倡多犁多上粪，太行黎城大部区村经过三犁后始行播种。第四，在冀中、冀鲁豫等水灾区，大力进行疏水种麦。据冀鲁豫二、三、七三个分区六个县统计，至十月二十日，已疏水七千顷，冀中白洋淀亦有一千四百顷脱水种上麦子。第五，太行的豫北、冀鲁豫的黄河南、冀中的大清河北及北岳的平西等边沿区，发扬过去经验，以劳武结合，实行“黄一块、收一块，耕一块、种一块”，完成抢收抢种，粉碎了敌人的破坏阴谋。
    在十月份，各地已先后由秋收种麦转入秋耕。冀南、冀鲁豫争取上冻前把白茬地普耕一遍，特别着重曾有过旱、虫灾的地区。太行长治等县动手较早，领导较好的村庄，已于十月中旬完成。北岳怀来等县素无秋耕习惯，领导上大力宣传秋耕能杀虫防旱，群众也已开始秋耕。各地在秋耕中遇到的困难，最严重的是牲口的动员与组织使用问题。解决办法，太行昔阳等县是一方面适当提高牲口工资，一方面清理积欠工资，使有牲口户不吃亏。晋中支前任务繁重，不少地方组织人拉犁与人刨地，也解决了部分问题。其次是若干群众中还存在等待平分或抽补土地的思想，怕白耕了。各地均针对这一思想进行政策宣传。以上问题正继续解决中。
    此外，华北各地并进行了开展冬季生产的准备工作，太行、北岳、冀中、冀南、冀鲁豫各领导机关，纷纷拟订冬季生产计划，强调开展各种副业生产，要求各地根据当地生产条件与特点，定出恢复、发展计划。并准备明年大生产的足够资本和必要条件，号召群众在冬季修理及添置水车、农具及开凿水井，修圈养猪，大量积肥。并把在农业生产中发展起来的农业互助组织，在冬季转为经营副业生产的合作社。在结束土改与整党中，要切实照顾群众生产时间。冀鲁豫区并发贷款二十八亿零三千万元，麦子三百零五万斤，协助群众冬季生产。
