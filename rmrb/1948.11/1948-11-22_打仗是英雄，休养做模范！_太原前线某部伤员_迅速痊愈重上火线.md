　　Fighting is heroic, recuperating is exemplary!
    Wounded soldiers of a certain unit on the Taiyuan front
  　Quickly recover and return to the front lines
    [Taiyuan Frontline Telegram] In the past three weeks, a quarter of the wounded soldiers in the rear hospital of a certain unit have returned to the Taiyuan front.

    When these heroes arrived at the hospital after being wounded, they were organized according to the original unit structure under the unified plan of the hospital. They elected leading cadres and consciously managed themselves, putting forward the powerful slogan: "Fighting at the front is heroic, recuperating in the rear is exemplary." They comforted, helped, and encouraged each other. Comrades Li Weisheng and Du Xianzhao, who were elected as instructors of the recuperation company, often told everyone that fighting and shedding blood at the front was for the people, and that recuperating in the rear, abiding by hospital rules, and helping with the hospital's work was also for the people. We come to the hospital with honor, and we must return to the unit with honor. We must add glory upon glory, and especially call on Communist Party members to lead by example, and not forget to work while recuperating. Because they helped the hospital with a lot of work, especially enlightening the wounded with the idea of cherishing honor, the wounded maintained full fighting spirit, and more than thirty exemplary recuperation personnel emerged. For example, Comrade Xing Laishun, who was praised: "Gets up early in the morning, gets up and sweeps the floor, the inside and outside of the ward are clean, carries the rice bucket and runs to the kitchen, fetches water and food first, and helps severely wounded comrades serve their meals." Anyone with merits is immediately praised by everyone, while those who are more impatient or have a bad temper are given patient explanations and appropriate criticism. Under such conscious, organized, and self-managed education, coupled with the efforts of the hospital staff, many lightly wounded comrades quickly recovered their health and, led by comrades Li Weisheng, Song Xiaogen, Xie Changyuan, and Du Xianzhao, quickly went to the front lines. At each farewell meeting for those leaving the hospital, the departing and remaining comrades encouraged each other, shouting slogans such as "Recover and go to the front, glory is truly glorious" and "Capture Taiyuan, capture Yan Xishan alive" amidst the sound of gongs and drums. Wang Zongyuan, the platoon leader of a certain artillery company who was seriously wounded, said: "Hearing the sound of artillery so loudly, I was so anxious that I couldn't sleep all night, just afraid I wouldn't be able to catch up with the battle for Taiyuan." Two other seriously wounded men, Wang Changxing and Zheng Kesheng, said: "Not hearing the news doesn't make us anxious, but hearing about victories everywhere makes us even more anxious. It's really distressing to not be able to participate in the general assault on Taiyuan." Although their bodies are lying in the hospital, their hearts are always on the front line.

　　打仗是英雄，休养做模范！
    太原前线某部伤员
  　迅速痊愈重上火线
    【太原前线电】某部后方医院三个礼拜以来，已有四分之一的伤员重新走上太原前线。
    当这些英雄们负伤到达医院后，即在医院统一计划之下，按照原来部队的建制组织起来，选举领导干部，自觉的自己管理自己，并提出：“前方打仗是英雄，后方休养做模范”的有力口号。他们互相安慰帮助与鼓励，被选为休养连指导员的李未生、杜先照等同志，经常向大家讲在前方打仗流血是为人民，到后方休养遵守院规，帮助医院工作也是为人民。我们带着光荣到医院，还要带着光荣回部队，要做到光荣上面加光荣，特别号召共产党员要以身作则，在休养当中不要忘记做工作。由于他们帮助医院进行了许多工作，特别是启发伤员珍贵光荣的思想教育，使伤员保持了饱满的战斗情绪，并涌现了三十余个模范休养人员，例如受到表扬的邢来顺同志：“清早起床起的早，起来就把地来扫，病室内外都干净，抬起饭桶火房跑，打水打饭他在先，帮助重伤号把饭端。”谁有优点马上就受到大家表扬，而对于个别比较急燥或好发脾气的同志，则进行耐心的解释与适当批评。在这种自觉的有组织的自我管理教育之下，再加上医院工作人员的努力，使许多负轻伤的同志迅速恢复了健康，并在李未生、宋小根、解长元、杜先照等同志带领下，迅速开到了火线。在每次出院的欢送会上，出院与留院的同志都互相讲话鼓励，在锣鼓喧天中大家高呼着“伤好上前线，光荣真光荣”“攻下太原城，活捉阎锡山”等口号。负了重伤的某炮兵连一排长王宗元说：“听到炮响的很厉害，着急的一夜睡不着，光怕自己赶不上打太原了。”另两个负了重伤的王长兴和郑科胜说：“不听消息不着急，一听到各处打胜仗更着急，参加不了总攻太原真是苦恼。”他们的身体虽然躺在医院，但他们的心却一直在火线上。
