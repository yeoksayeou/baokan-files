Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the strikes and slowdowns by workers in various industries in the Kuomintang-controlled areas against hunger and for warmth are expanding daily. According to incomplete materials disclosed by foreign news agencies and newspapers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, this struggle has spread to nine major cities in the past month: Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Wuchang, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Nanchang. Among them, the Shanghai and Nanjing areas, the political and economic centers of the Kuomintang, are the most intense. Since the middle of last month, workers on the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) and Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou) railways, workers in the Pukou section of the Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou) Railway, ferry workers from Pukou to Nanjing, and workers in Shanghai's tram, water, gas, silk reeling, textile, hosiery, flour, electrical, machinery, tobacco, film, customs, and dock industries have participated in strikes and slowdowns. According to the Associated Press, as of the 20th of this month, the number of strikers in Shanghai had reached six figures or more (i.e., over 100,000). Tianjin, as the industrial and commercial center of the Kuomintang in North China, has seen strikes by employees in customs, buses, trams, telecommunications, and other industries since the end of October, with tram workers alone numbering more than 1,500. In addition to the strike by more than 3,000 telecommunications workers in Beiping in late October, more than 2,000 workers on the Pinghan Railway held a "hunger strike" on November 4th. More than 200 employees at the Tanggu Station of the Beining Railway petitioned on the 30th of last month, demanding improved living conditions. More than 700 employees of the Qingdao Telecommunications Bureau held a "hunger strike" on November 2nd. Workers in the city's printing, water, port authority, and docks have also held anti-hunger petitions. Workers in the Wuchang section of the Yuehan Railway went on strike on November 11th. Thousands of workers in eight silk factories in three districts of Hangzhou, various textile factories in Ningbo, and printing workers in various newspaper offices in Nanchang have participated in anti-hunger strikes since mid-October.

This large-scale struggle against hunger and for warmth is a direct result of soaring prices and severe food shortages after the Kuomintang-controlled areas' "currency reform," coupled with the freezing of workers' wages and the cessation of cost-of-living adjustments. Under the Kuomintang reactionary government's starvation policy, workers in various industries have generally felt unable to survive. For example, workers at the Pinghan Railway Bureau in Beiping earned only 20 or 30 pseudo-gold yuan per month after the "currency reform," which, based on the price of rice in Beiping at the beginning of the month, was only enough to buy a little over 10 catties of rice. Most of them have sold everything and their families are surviving on sweet potatoes. On the 9th of this month, the price of rice in Shanghai rose to 1,800 pseudo-gold yuan per dan, while the average monthly wage of workers was only 100 to 150 yuan, which could only buy 8 to 12 catties of rice. In this anti-hunger movement, workers in various industries generally demanded the rationing of food, the provision of relief funds, and increased wages.

Under the heroic struggle of the broad masses of workers, the Kuomintang authorities were forced to cancel the freeze on wages and restore the "cost of living index" in mid-November. However, because the "cost of living index" stipulated by the Kuomintang government lags far behind the actual price increase in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, for example, the "cost of living index" for Shanghai workers is stipulated to be 8.1 times the limited price on August 19th, while the price of rice in Shanghai on the 9th of this month has risen to 85 times the 819 limited price, which still makes it impossible for workers to survive, and even the extremely low standard of living on August 19th cannot be maintained. This situation has aroused a wave of angry protests from workers and promoted the continued development of the anti-hunger and warmth struggle. As of the 24th, according to Reuters, "The wave of strikes in Shanghai has not shown any signs of subsiding, and an estimated 100,000 workers are still refusing to return to work due to the denial of wage increase demands."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: The Shanghai strike continues to expand. According to the Associated Press, a major strike by customs officials broke out again on the 20th. The Associated Press said that this strike was actually a continuation of their sit-in strike for the past two weeks. The strike by cinema machine workers is still ongoing, and cinema ushers have also been drawn into the struggle, demanding that the excessively low cost of living index stipulated by the Kuomintang government be doubled. This strike has caused all cinemas in Shanghai to stop showing films. The Associated Press said that the number of workers on strike in various industries in Shanghai has reached six figures or more (i.e., over 100,000).

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: The anti-hunger struggle of people from all walks of life in Shanghai has expanded sharply. Reuters reported on the 19th that the labor unrest in Shanghai has entered an explosive stage. Following the 24-hour strike by silk and textile workers and cinema technicians, thousands of primary and secondary school teachers also went on strike, demanding higher salaries and improved working conditions. Reuters said that the strike has so far brought dozens of factories, all cinemas, and most schools to a standstill.

### 反饥饿，争温饱！　国民党区工潮扩大　上海罢工者达十万以上

　　反饥饿，争温饱！
  　国民党区工潮扩大
  　上海罢工者达十万以上
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】综合报导：国民党统治区各业职工反饥饿、争温饱的罢工怠工，日益扩展。根据外国通讯社及国民党统治区报纸披露之不完全材料统计，过去一个月来，这一斗争遍及上海、南京、天津、北平、青岛、武昌、杭州、宁波、南昌九大城市。其中以国民党政治、经济中心的沪、宁地区最为剧烈。该两地从上月中旬以来，先后参加罢工、怠工的有京沪、沪杭两铁路工人，津浦路浦口段工人，浦口至南京摆渡工人，上海电车、自来水、煤气、缫丝、纺织、织袜、面粉、电气、机器、烟草、电影、海关、码头职工。据美联社报导，至本月廿日，上海罢工人数已达六位数字以上（即十万人以上）。作为国民党华北工商业中心的天津，从十月下旬起，曾先后爆发海关、公共汽车、电车、电信等业职工的罢工，仅电车职工罢工人数即达一千五百余人。北平除十月下旬爆发三千余电信职工罢工外，平汉铁路职工二千余人，曾于十一月四日举行“饿工”。北宁路塘沽站二百余职工，于上月三十日请愿，要求改善生活待遇。青岛电信局职工七百余人，于十一月二日“饿工”。该市印剧、自来水、港务局及码头工人等亦纷纷举行反饥饿请愿。粤汉铁路武昌段工人于十一月十一日罢工。杭州三区八家绸厂、宁波各纺织厂千余工人、南昌各报馆印剧工人，自十月中旬起曾先后参加反饥饿罢工。
    这一大规模反饥饿、争温饱的斗争，是国民党统治区“币改”后物价飞涨、粮荒严重而又冻结职工工资、停止按生活指数发薪的直接结果。在国民党反动政府的饥饿政策下，各业职工已普遍感到活不下去。例如北平平汉路局工人，“币改”后月入仅伪金圆券二、三十元，按月初北平米价，只够买十多斤米。他们大都典卖一空，家属吃白薯渡日。本月九日上海米价每担已涨至伪金圆券一千八百元，而工人的每月平均工资仅一百元至一百五十元，只能买八斤到十二斤大米。在这一次反饥饿运动中，各业职工普遍提出配给粮食、发给救济费及增加薪水等要求。
    在广大职工们的英勇斗争下，国民党当局被迫取消冻结工资的规定，并于本月中旬恢复“生活指数”的办法。但由于国民党政府所规定的“生活指数”远远落后于国民党区物价实际上涨倍数，例如上海工人“生活指数”规定为八月十九日限价时的八点一倍，而上海米价本月九日已上涨为八一九限价的八十五倍，依然使工人无法生活下去，连八一九时本已极低的生活水平都无法维持。这种情形激起了工人们愤怒的抗议浪潮，促使反饥饿争温饱斗争的继续发展。截至二十四日，据路透社消息称：“上海罢工浪潮仍未显出趋于平息的迹象，因增资要求未获准，估计十万工人仍拒绝复工”。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】上海罢工继续扩大。据美联社消息：二十日又爆发海关职员的大罢工。美联社称：这一罢工实际上是他们过去两周静坐罢工的延续。电影院机器工人的罢工仍在坚持，影院招待员亦已卷入这一斗争，他们要求将国民党政府所规定的过低生活指数提高一倍。这一罢工已使上海各电影院停演。美联社称：上海各业工人罢工人数已达到六位数字以上（即十万人以上）。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】上海各阶层人民的反饥饿斗争猛烈扩展。路透社十九日电称：上海的工潮已进入爆炸性阶段。继丝业与纺织工人及电影院技工罢工二十四小时之后，数千名中小学教员也举行罢教，要求提高薪金、改善工作条件。路透社称：罢工迄今已使数十所工厂、全部的电影院和大多数学校陷于停顿。
