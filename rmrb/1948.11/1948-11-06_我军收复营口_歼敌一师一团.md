　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 4th: Simultaneously with the liberation of Shenyang, Yingkou was also recovered on the 2nd. The enemy's entire 2nd Division of the 52nd Army and one regiment of the 25th Division in the city were completely annihilated. The 52nd Army headquarters, the army's directly subordinate special service regiment, and two regiments of the 25th Division escaped by boat, but one of their ships and more than twenty sailing boats were destroyed by our artillery, killing more than 3,000 enemies. After our army captured Jinzhou and liberated Changchun in the middle of last month, the enemy's 52nd Army fled south from Liaoyang and occupied Yingkou on October 24th, attempting to escape by sea. However, our army's rapid action foiled the enemy's plan. After the liberation of Yingkou, the Kuomintang only had a narrow beachhead position left in Jinxi and Huludao in Northeast China.
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 4th: On the night of the 2nd, Harbin celebrated the liberation of Shenyang all night long. Shortly after the Northeast Branch of the Xinhua News Agency received the news from the front at 20:00 on that day, a huge red star lamp symbolizing the great victory of the Northeast Liberation War appeared on the top of the seven-story building of the Northeast Daily, and the good news quickly spread throughout the Northeast by telegram, telephone, and radio. Gongs and drums immediately sounded in various agencies, factories, and schools in Harbin, and Yangko teams and propaganda trucks were dispatched one after another, with firecrackers sounding like New Year's Eve. The streets in various districts were filled with noise, and cheers thundered. The Northeast Administrative Committee and the Municipal Government were jam-packed, and the Daoli, Daowai, and Nangang districts were all empty.
    Furthermore: Amidst the frequent victories, commodity prices in the city have steadily declined. Merchants, believing that the entire Northeast region has been liberated and that goods are flowing smoothly, have been selling off their inventories. Compared with October 24th, the price of various cloths on October 26th decreased by 50,000 to 80,000 per bolt. Compared with October 20th, the price of groceries on October 27th decreased by 6% to 40% for oils, 14% for alkali, and 16% for salt. Compared with before October 20th, the Northeast Bank's gold purchases increased by 75%, and sales decreased by 81% on the 26th.

　　我军收复营口　歼敌一师一团
    【新华社哈尔滨四日电】与沈阳的解放同时，营口也于二日收复。该城之敌五十二军第二师全部及二十五师的一个团被全部歼灭。五十二军军部、军直特务团及二十五师的两个团乘船逃走，被我炮兵击毁其轮船一艘，帆船二十余只，毙敌三千余。上月中旬我军攻克锦州、解放长春后，敌五十二军即由辽阳南窜，十月二十四日侵占营口，企图由海上逃跑。但是我军的迅速行动破坏了敌人的计划。营口解放后，国民党在东北最后只剩下锦西与葫芦岛一块狭窄的滩头阵地。
    【新华社哈尔滨四日电】二日夜哈尔滨市通宵狂欢，庆祝解放沈阳。新华社东北总分社于是日二十时接获前线消息后不久，象征东北解放战争大功告成的巨大红星灯，即在东北日报七层大楼之楼顶出现，捷音迅速由电报、电话、广播电台传播全东北。哈市各机关、工厂、学校等立即响起了锣鼓，秧歌队、宣传卡车纷纷出动，爆竹声如闹除夕。各区街人声腾沸，欢呼雷动。东北行政委员会及市政府门前水泄不通，道里、道外及南岗各区万人空巷。
    又讯：该市在胜利频传声中，物价平稳下降。商人以东北全境解放，物资畅流，纷纷抛售存货。各种布价，十月二十六日与二十四日比较，每匹下降五万至八万不等。杂货类十月二十七日与二十日前比较，油类下降百分之六到百分之四十，碱下降百分之十四，盐下降百分之十六。东北银行之黄金收售，二十六日与二十日以前比较，收买量增加百分之七十五，售出量则减少了百分之八十一。
