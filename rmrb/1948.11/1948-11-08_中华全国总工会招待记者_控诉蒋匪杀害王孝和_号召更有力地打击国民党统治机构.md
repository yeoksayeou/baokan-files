　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 4th: Regarding the Shanghai American-owned Electric Company worker Wang Xiaohe's murder by the Kuomintang reactionaries, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions telegraphed the entire nation and overseas compatriots a few days ago, and held a reception for journalists in Harbin. The true facts of the incident were publicized, and this fascist bloody atrocity was condemned. At the reception, Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, stated: Wang Xiaohe and others were killed and sentenced to imprisonment by the Kuomintang bandit gang's so-called "Special Criminal Tribunal." There are already twenty-four of these fascist organizations in various cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Now, the tottering Kuomintang reactionary rulers are using this organization to cruelly suppress workers, students, and even national capitalists there. Zhu stated that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions expresses extreme outrage at the Kuomintang bandit gang's murder of Wang Xiaohe and the sentencing of six workers, including Wu Guozhen, to imprisonment. This despicable and shameless suppression by the Kuomintang bandit gang will only strengthen the resistance of the working class and the people of the entire country and accelerate the early demise of their reactionary rule. Zhu Junxin, a Standing Committee member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (one of the Shanghai representatives attending the Labor Congress), firmly stated: The working class cannot be exterminated. When one Wang Xiaohe falls, thousands of Wang Xiaohes will stand up. We will turn grief into strength, strive to complete the mission given to us by the workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and hope that the workers in the liberated areas will redouble their efforts in production to support the Liberation War, fight to Shanghai and Nanjing, and avenge the dead workers and the people! It is reported that Wang Xiaohe was an outstanding young leader of the Shanghai electricity workers, 27 years old, from Yin County, Zhejiang. After joining the Shanghai American-owned Electric Company as a power plant radio operator in 1943, he was elected as the head of the radio station union group, the standing director of the power plant branch of the Shanghai Electric Power Union. After the two major strikes by Shanghai electricity workers in September and November 1947, he was elected as the standing director of the Shanghai Electric Power Union. In March of this year, he was arrested by the Kuomintang bandit gang on the fabricated charge of "sabotaging generators," and was shot and killed by the bandits on September 30. The full text of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' telegram to the entire nation and overseas compatriots regarding the Wang Xiaohe tragedy is as follows:

　　To be forwarded by Xinhua News Agency to trade unions in various regions, people's organizations, and all people of the country and overseas compatriots:

　　The Kuomintang reactionary government, on September 30th, fabricated the charge of sabotaging machines and, after the so-called "Special Criminal Tribunal" pronounced its verdict, openly murdered Wang Xiaohe, a worker at the Shanghai Electric Power Company, and sentenced six workers, including Wu Guozhen, to life imprisonment and fixed-term imprisonment. This outrageous and bloody crime by the Kuomintang is further ironclad proof that they will openly carry out mass arrests and killings of the working class and the people striving for freedom, democracy, and survival in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in the future, using despicable means of fabricating charges. In the past, in order to maintain their traitorous and dictatorial rule, the Kuomintang continuously harmed the people who resisted tyranny through illegal means such as secret arrests, kidnappings, and assassinations, but as a result, it aroused more fierce resistance from the broad masses of the people. Now, as the People's Liberation Army continues to win victories and the Kuomintang reactionary rule is tottering, they have further adopted more vicious and despicable slaughter policies to suppress the struggle of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to save their lives. They attempt to use the means of fabricating charges and verdicts by the so-called "Special Criminal Tribunal" to deceive public opinion and cover up their fascist atrocities. In the past two months, Qin Yuanbang, a professor at Guangdong College and editor of the Guangzhou People's Daily, was also sacrificed under this despicable and brutal method of the Kuomintang, and thousands more have been arrested and imprisoned. We call on workers and all democrats across the country to resolutely stand up against this fascist atrocity and expose and shatter this despicable conspiracy.

　　Comrade Wang Xiaohe was killed under this conspiracy. We express our deep condolences! We also deeply care about the six workers, including Wu Guozhen, who have been sentenced to imprisonment! We have decided to allocate funds from the "Aid to the Struggle of Workers in the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas Fund" of the liberated areas to provide relief to their families. We call on: workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to use all means to rescue the six illegally sentenced workers, and actively strengthen their own unity, broadly unite all oppressed people, and continue the struggle more resolutely, bravely, and cautiously, giving the Kuomintang ruling organizations a more powerful blow from all aspects. The workers in the liberated areas should use all their strength to support the People's Liberation War, so that the People's Army can advance more quickly to the Kuomintang-controlled areas, so as to achieve the goal of completely overthrowing the Kuomintang traitorous government and establishing a New Democratic New China more quickly. Only in this way can the liberation of the working class and the people of the whole country be victoriously realized.

　　中华全国总工会招待记者
  　控诉蒋匪杀害王孝和
    号召更有力地打击国民党统治机构
    【新华社哈尔滨四日电】中华全国总工会为国民党反动派杀害上海美商电力公司工友王孝和事件，于日前通电全国及海外侨胞，并在哈市招待记者。公布事件真象，控诉此种法西斯血腥暴行。招待会中首由全总副主席朱学范发言称：王孝和等人的被杀害和判处徒刑，是由国民党匪帮的所谓“特种刑庭”判决的。这一法西斯组织在国民党统治区各城市已有二十四个之多。现在，摇摇欲坠的国民党反动统治者正通过这一组织来残酷镇压那里的工人、学生、直到民族资本家。朱氏称，全总对于国民党匪帮杀害王孝和及判处吴国桢等六位工友徒刑，表示十二万分的愤恨。国民党匪帮此种卑鄙无耻的镇压，其结果只是加强全国工人阶级和人民的反抗，加速其反动统治的早日灭亡。全总常委朱俊欣（出席劳动大会之上海代表之一）坚决表示：工人阶级是杀不完的，一个王孝和倒下，就有千万个王孝和站起来。我们将化悲痛为力量，努力完成国民党统治区工人赋给我们的使命。并希望解放区工友加倍努力生产，支援解放战争，打到上海、南京去，为死难的工友和人民复仇！按王孝和为出色的年青的上海电力工人领导者之一，现年二十七岁，浙江鄞县人。一九四三年入上海美商电力公司任发电厂电台配电员后，曾先后被选为电台工会组长，上海电力工会电厂分会常务干事，一九四七年九月、十一月上海电力工人两次大罢工后，被选为上海电力工会常务理事。今年三月，被国民党匪帮以捏造之“破坏发电机”罪名逮捕，九月三十日被匪枪杀。全总为王孝和惨案致全国及海外侨胞之通电原文如次：
    新华社转各地职工会，各人民团体及全国人民与海外侨胞均鉴：
    国民党反动政府竟于九月三十日捏造破坏机器的罪名，经过所谓“特种刑庭”的宣判，公然杀害了上海电力公司工友王孝和，并将吴国桢等六工友判处无期及有期徒刑。国民党这一令人发指的血腥罪行，是他们今后对于国民党统治区工人阶级及争取自由、民主与生存的人民，将用假造罪名的卑劣手段公开进行大量逮捕和杀戮的又一铁证。过去国民党为了维持他们卖国独裁的统治，对于反抗暴政的人民，曾不断以秘密逮捕、绑架、暗杀等非法手段进行残害，但结果激起了广大人民更激烈的反抗。现在当人民解放军连续胜利，国民党反动统治摇摇欲坠之际，他们为了垂死的挣扎，竟进一步采用更毒辣更卑鄙的屠杀政策，来镇压国民党统治区人民救死求生的斗争。企图用所谓“特种刑庭”捏罪判决的手段，蒙蔽社会视听，来掩盖其法西斯的暴虐行为。近两月中牺牲在国民党这种卑劣残暴手段之下的还有广东学院教授，广州人民日报编辑秦元邦，被逮捕监禁者更以千计。我们号召全国工人和一切民主人士，坚决起来反对这种法西斯暴行，揭露并粉碎这种卑劣的阴谋手段。
    王孝和工友是在这一阴谋下被杀了，我们表示沉痛的哀悼！我们并以深切的心情，关怀着被判徒刑的吴国桢等六位工友！并决定从解放区职工“援助国民党统治区职工斗争基金”中拨款救济他们的家属。我们号召：国民党统治区的职工们用一切方法援救被非法判决的六位工友，并积极加强自身的团结，广泛地联合一切被压迫人民，更加坚毅勇敢和灵活谨慎地继续斗争，从各方面给国民党的统治机构以更有力的打击。解放区的职工们，则应用全力支援人民解放战争，使人民军队更迅速的向国民党统治区前进。以便更快的达到彻底推翻国民党卖国政府、建立新民主主义的新中国的目的。只有这样，全国工人阶级和全国人民的解放，才能胜利实现。
