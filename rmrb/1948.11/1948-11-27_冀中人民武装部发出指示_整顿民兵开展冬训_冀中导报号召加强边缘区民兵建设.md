[Jizhong Electric] The People's Armed Forces Department of the Jizhong Military Region, based on the North China Military Region's 1948 Winter Work Instructions and the specific conditions in Jizhong, issued supplementary instructions on rectification and winter training. The instructions stated that cadres of the People's Armed Forces Department in the region should participate in rural Party rectification work, learn about the village's war service organization and service burden, and solve ideological, work style, and discipline issues of Party members, cadres, and militia through Party rectification, laying the foundation for rectifying the people's armed organizations. At the same time, it pointed out that all levels should specifically study the spirit and requirements of the North China Military Region's Winter Work Instructions, and should earnestly purify the organization, master weapons, balance service, strictly enforce discipline, clear up thoughts about supporting the front, and correct village cadres' avoidance of service. However, it is necessary to prevent formalistic or unprincipled tendencies. Counties and districts should focus on key points for sound restoration and reorganization based on different regions and organizational conditions. While completing the reorganization, they should also complete the numbers of various task forces, livestock, and weapons, and clear up long and short-term service, and arrange the order of attendance for supporting the front. Before the end of November, the district Party committee should issue a notice, and the 8th, 9th, and 11th sub-districts should first prepare ×× stretcher companies. In the process of reorganization, it is necessary to establish and improve the district and village leadership system, such as division of labor among cadres, meetings, reports, criticism and self-criticism, etc., to overcome work stagnation and disunity.

Regarding border areas and newly recovered areas, it is necessary to rely on the masses' awareness and demands, and strengthen militia construction according to the development and deepening of the struggle against the enemy. Adopt the policy of consolidation and development in actual combat, emphasize political purity and composition purity, strengthen ideological education, overcome the work style of being detached from the masses, and impure organization, and ensure the Party's leadership. According to the regional situation and the development of the organization, areas with the conditions to openly persist in development should have planned construction of key points and joint defense operations. Emphasize unified leadership and timely replenishment of weapons, but they must be controlled by Party members and reliable elements, and education on cherishing weapons and saving ammunition should be carried out.

The main task of urban reorganization is to solve the problem of reasonable attendance. At the same time, strengthen the political, work style, and discipline education of the militia, and combine with the public security department to clear out bandits and spies and protect urban security.

Regarding winter training, each county can convene village cadres for short-term rotational training for three to five days; village training should be unified with the organization of the winter school. The training time is twenty days to one month, ending no later than the 25th day of the twelfth lunar month. The training content requires that in general central areas, the three major centers should be support-the-front knowledge, service methods, and discipline, and other content such as current affairs, politics, and production should be carried out uniformly with the winter school. In border areas, equal emphasis should be placed on current affairs, central work, tasks, discipline, and the three major skills (shooting, grenade throwing, mine laying). Support-the-front combat education should adopt the method of combining combat and training, and conduct research and discussion through the specific facts experienced in local support-the-front combat, in order to achieve the purpose of correcting shortcomings and improving technology.

[Jizhong Electric] Jizhong Guide recently published a short commentary entitled "Strengthening Militia Construction Work" in the border areas. After pointing out the importance of strengthening the militia armed construction in the Jizhong border areas, it particularly emphasized: Seize the different requirements of the masses in different periods and different situations to establish and develop the militia. Many militiamen in Jinwu were developed in the struggle against the enemy on the basis of protecting the masses' production during the busy farming season, protecting autumn harvests in the autumn, protecting grain after the autumn, and protecting young adults when the enemy arrested recruits. Only such a militia will be enthusiastically supported by the broad masses and will be developed and strengthened. We must seize the opportunity to establish and develop militia organizations in all villages where it is possible to establish them but have not yet done so, based on this experience.

　　冀中人民武装部发出指示
  　整顿民兵开展冬训
    冀中导报号召加强边缘区民兵建设
    【冀中电】冀中军区人民武装部，根据华北军区人民武装部一九四八年冬季工作指示与冀中具体情况，发出整组与冬训工作的补充指示。指示该区人民武装部干部要参加农村整党工作，从中了解村内战勤组织及勤务负担情况，通过整党解决党员干部、民兵的思想、作风、纪律等问题，打下整顿人民武装组织的基础。同时指出：各级应具体研究华北军区人民武装部的冬季工作指示的精神与要求，应切实做到纯洁组织，掌握武器，平衡服勤，严整纪律，打通支前思想，纠正村干逃避勤务等问题。但须防止形式的或无原则的偏向。县区应根据不同地区，不同组织情况，抓住重点，进行健全恢复整理。并在完成整组同时完成各种任务队、人畜、武器等数字，及清理长短勤，排好出勤支前顺序。十一月底以前以区党委通知，八、九、十一各分区先编好××个担架连。在整组过程中，要建立健全区村领导制度，如干部分工、会议、汇报、批评与自我批评等，克服工作自流与不团结现象。
    关于边沿区与新收复区，应是依靠群众觉悟与要求，按对敌斗争的发展与深入，加强民兵建设，在实际斗争中采取整理与发展的方针，强调政治纯洁，成份纯洁，加强其思想教育，克服脱离群众的作风，及组织不纯，保证党的领导。按照地区形势及组织的发展，有条件公开坚持开展的地区应有计划的建设重点及联防作战。强调统一领导，及时补充武器，但一定掌握在党员及可靠分子手里，进行爱护武器节省弹药的教育。
    城市整组，主要解决合理出勤的问题。同时加强民兵政治、作风、纪律教育，结合公安部门清查匪特，保卫城市安全。
    关于冬季训练，各县可召集村干进行三五天的短期轮训；村训则应与冬校之组织统一配备。训练时间二十天至一个月，最晚于阴历十二月二十五日前结束。训练内容，要求一般中心地区以支前常识、勤务办法、纪律为三大中心，其他时事、政治、生产等内容与冬校统一进行。边缘区以时事、中心工作、任务、纪律与三大技术（射击、投弹、埋雷）并重。支前作战教育，采取战练合一办法，通过本地支前作战经历过的具体事实，开展研究讨论，以达到改正缺点、提高技术为目的。
    【冀中电】冀中导报顷以边缘区“加强民兵建设工作”为题发表短论，指出冀中边缘区加强民兵武装建设的重要性后，特别强调：抓紧群众在不同时期不同情况下的不同要求，去建立和发展民兵。津武不少民兵就是在农忙时保护群众生产、秋季护秋、秋后保粮、敌人抓丁时保护青壮年等群众利益上，在对敌斗争中发展起来的。也只有这样的民兵才会得到广大群众的热烈拥护和支持，才会得到发展和壮大。我们要在一切可能建立还没有建立起民兵组织的村庄，根据这一经验抓紧建立和发展。
