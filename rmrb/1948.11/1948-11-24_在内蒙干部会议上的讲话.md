　　Speech at the Inner Mongolia Cadre Conference
    Gao Gang
    August 3, 1948

    Comrade Yunze's concluding report at this meeting was very good, and the Northeast Bureau fully agrees. I will talk about five issues here: the path to Inner Mongolia's liberation and the Party's ethnic policy; the current situation of Inner Mongolia's work; the current policies of the Inner Mongolia Party; strengthening the unity of Mongolian and Han cadres; and future tasks.

    I. The Path to Inner Mongolia's Liberation and the Party's Ethnic Policy

    The speeches of everyone illustrate one issue: which path to Inner Mongolia's liberation is impassable, and which path is passable. For hundreds of years, the people of Inner Mongolia have suffered cruel rule and oppression from foreign invaders. The Manchus, the Northern Warlords, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the Japanese imperialists all used various cruel and vicious methods to exploit the people of Inner Mongolia, while the feudal ruling class of Inner Mongolia helped them to do so. This has turned a historically valiant nation into skin and bones, weak and feeble, and heading towards decline day by day. Eliminating foreign ethnic oppression and internal feudal oppression has been the urgent demand of the people of Inner Mongolia for many years. But why has this not been achieved in the past? Apart from external reasons, as everyone has said, it is mainly because Inner Mongolia's feudal rulers led wolves into the house, using the guise of "autonomy" to collude with foreign invaders and sell out ethnic interests in order to consolidate their privileged positions. Traitors like Demchugdongrub (De Wang), Li Shou-hsin, Bai Yun-ti, and Wu He-ling are representatives of this kind of figure. They were the ones who sold out Inner Mongolia's land in every dynasty, they were the ones who betrayed and sabotaged the ethnic liberation movement, they were the ones who became relatives with Zhang Zuolin and Wu Junsheng, they were the ones who went to Chiang Kai-shek to become officials, and they were the ones who helped the Japanese invaders enslave the people of Inner Mongolia and fight their Outer Mongolian brothers. Everyone can think about it, apart from creating backwardness, ignorance, poverty, hardship, and weakness, apart from extorting people's wealth to maintain their own special lives, have these feudal ruling classes of Inner Mongolia ever done anything truly good for the people of Inner Mongolia?

    The painful historical lesson is: relying on the feudal ruling class, the people of Inner Mongolia can never achieve liberation. On the contrary, they will only increasingly move towards being eliminated by foreign invaders. All people of conscience in Inner Mongolia can only have a bright future by firmly standing with the people.

    After August 15, 1945, why was Inner Mongolia able to achieve liberation again? Why was it able to establish a unified autonomous government for eastern and western Mongolia? Why could the urgent demands of the people of Inner Mongolia for hundreds of years be achieved all at once?

    This is mainly due to the active assistance of the Soviet Union, Outer Mongolia, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, especially the result of the heroic struggle of the people of Inner Mongolia under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Without the dispatch of troops by the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia, could Japanese imperialism have been quickly defeated? Could the Northeast and Inner Mongolia have been quickly liberated? Obviously not. Helping small and weak nations to achieve liberation is the bounden duty of socialist countries and the national policy stipulated by Lenin and Stalin. Outer Mongolia is even more economically backward than Inner Mongolia, but they have been liberated for twenty-five years, and this is due to the assistance of the powerful Soviet Union. Everyone should have a clear understanding of this major factor of external assistance.

    After the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia withdrew their troops from Inner Mongolia, Chiang Kai-shek's gang, with the assistance of American imperialism, opened fire on the Chinese people, including the people of Inner Mongolia. They transported De Wang to Chongqing and Peiping by plane, and sent Li Shou-hsin to the Northeast. Fu Zuoyi and Du Yuming simultaneously attacked eastern and western Mongolia. At this time, all the big and small Mongolian traitors stirred up trouble, and all the reactionaries still wanted to continue sitting on the heads of the people of Inner Mongolia. However, this time, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and the reactionaries of Inner Mongolia did not achieve their goals. The People's Liberation Army shattered the attack of Chiang's bandit army inside and outside the Great Wall, stabilizing the situation in Inner Mongolia and enabling various democratic reforms to proceed smoothly. There is no doubt that without the victories of the People's Liberation Army in the Northeast, North China, Northwest, East China, and the Central Plains, Inner Mongolia would continue to be invaded and enslaved by the Kuomintang reactionaries, American imperialism, and internal feudal rulers. It would have been impossible to crush the attack of the Kuomintang bandit army by relying solely on the strength of the people of Inner Mongolia. Everyone should also have a clear understanding of this second major factor of external assistance.

    Of course, without the efforts of the people of Inner Mongolia themselves, choosing the correct path of liberation, accepting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and cooperating with the People's Liberation Army, thereby rapidly developing revolutionary forces, the liberation of Inner Mongolia would also have been impossible.

    Therefore, the vivid historical lesson is: Inner Mongolia can only achieve true liberation under the assistance of the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia in defeating Japan, under the leadership and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, and under the condition that the people of Inner Mongolia themselves are organized to be masters of their own affairs. Everyone should use these vivid historical facts to widely educate cadres and the broad masses of the people.

    The path of Inner Mongolia's liberation proves that our Party's ethnic policy has always been correct and unwavering. Since its establishment, the Chinese Communist Party has declared that all ethnic groups within China are equal, recognized the right of all ethnic groups to autonomy and self-determination, and helped the liberation and development of minority ethnic groups in all aspects. The unified Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government was established through gradual development. Many leagues and banners in Inner Mongolia established local autonomous governments during their successive liberation processes, such as the Suiyuan-Mongolia Government during the Anti-Japanese War, and the local autonomous governments established in the liberated eastern and western leagues and banners after August 15th. Now, due to the war, some leagues and banners still need to be temporarily managed by other local governments in the liberated areas. However, as the situation develops, the unity of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government will be further strengthened. After the liberation of the whole country, the Federal Democratic Republic of China will be formed by all ethnic groups within China according to the principles of voluntariness and democracy (Mao Zedong's "On Coalition Government"). The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government will be the main component of this federation in the northern part of the country.

    As mentioned earlier, without the decisive help of advanced brothers, Inner Mongolia could not have been liberated. But is it possible now to no longer need help? There is no doubt that Inner Mongolia still needs long-term and strong assistance in its military, political, economic, and cultural aspects. For example, when a plague occurs in Wangyemiao, it is necessary to send an epidemic prevention team from outside; livestock plagues and venereal diseases in pastoral areas cannot be cured without modern medicine, which requires outside help. In short, Inner Mongolia is inseparable from other parts of China in all aspects, and it is impossible to imagine that it can achieve its own consolidation and development in isolation, leaving behind the unity and help of friendly domestic and foreign ethnic groups (such as the Han nationality, the Soviet Union, Outer Mongolia, etc.). If Inner Mongolia does not strive to catch up with the Han nationality in economic and cultural aspects, then the so-called ethnic equality will also be in vain. If Inner Mongolia's economic situation always remains at the level of "tea, cloth, water pipe, sugar, cattle, horses, camels, and sheep," then long-term economic dependence will inevitably lead to long-term political dependence. In this way, the Inner Mongolian ethnic group has not truly achieved liberation in reality. Only by truly improving economically and culturally can there be substantive, and not just formal, ethnic equality. Only in this way can the wisdom and excellent historical traditions of the Inner Mongolian working people be freely developed, and only then can the Inner Mongolian ethnic group have a bright future.

    This is our Party's firm and unwavering policy in the past, present, and future. Every comrade of the Inner Mongolia Party should deeply understand this.

    II. The Current Situation of Inner Mongolia's Work

    To describe the current situation of Inner Mongolia's work in one sentence, it is that the achievements are great, but the foundation is not solid enough.

    The broad masses of the people of Inner Mongolia have chosen their own correct path of ethnic liberation under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. This is the most fundamental gain in Inner Mongolia's work since August 15th. Therefore, great achievements have been made in many aspects.

    First, after breaking through various obstacles and going through a preparatory stage of the Autonomous Federation, a truly people's autonomous government unified for eastern and western Mongolia, which had never existed for hundreds of years, was finally established, and Inner Mongolia's own army was created. This government and army actively participated in the national liberation war, cooperated with the Northeast and North China Liberation Armies in combat, eliminated internal bandits, and defended the victorious fruits of the people of Inner Mongolia.

    Secondly, more than 3,000 cadres have been trained, thousands of intellectuals have been trained, and 4,000 Party members and thousands of Youth League members have been developed. On this basis, various sabotage and resistance from internal reactionary elements and the conspiracies of compromise and surrender have been successfully defeated.

    Thirdly, land reform has been carried out in agricultural areas, and the vast number of poor farmers have obtained land and plowing cattle, creating conditions for the free development of agricultural production. Various democratic reforms are also being carried out in other semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas and pastoral areas. From then on, Inner Mongolia's economic development began to gain freedom on a wide scale.

    In the course of many years of tortuous struggle, the people of Inner Mongolia found their true revolutionary leader - Comrade Yunze. Any hypocritical feudal upper-class figure in Inner Mongolia quickly lost their influence in the face of Chairman Yun's revolutionary stance, glorious history, and work achievements.

    The national self-esteem and self-confidence of the Inner Mongolian ethnic group have now been raised to an unprecedented level, and the historical gap and opposition between the Mongolian and Han nationalities are gradually being eliminated.

    This is a historically significant great victory for Inner Mongolia. This is a victory won by the heroic struggle of all the people of Inner Mongolia, the Inner Mongolia Army, and the Inner Mongolia Communist Party. This victory has laid the foundation for the future development of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, helped the advancement of the national revolutionary cause, and set an example for other minority ethnic groups in China seeking liberation.

    However, is everything done well now, and can we sit back and relax? Obviously, it is far from it. The foundation of Inner Mongolia's work is not solid enough, and there are still many problems.

    First of all, the organizational and awareness of the masses are still poor. Active development in economic and cultural aspects still requires great efforts. Work in pastoral areas has just begun. Work in agricultural areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas is very rough, and many deviations have occurred. Some places have been messed up, and some areas in western Mongolia have not been liberated.

    Secondly, the policy level and ideological level of cadres are still very low. There are few old cadres, and their experience is also poor. Not many can grasp a situation. New cadres are promoted quickly, and it is even more difficult to grasp policies. As for cadres who manage financial and economic construction and various specialized technologies, they are even more lacking. After the situation in western Mongolia is further opened up, it is also necessary to prepare to send a batch of cadres. Therefore, in terms of the quality and quantity of cadres, it is far from keeping up with the development of the situation, and efforts need to be made to improve.

    In addition, Inner Mongolia's external and internal enemies still exist. American imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and Mongolian traitor reactionary elements will never give up on Inner Mongolia. Like the Japanese imperialists, they value Inner Mongolia as an advanced base for anti-Soviet and anti-communist activities. They have established special intelligence agencies near Inner Mongolia, trying every possible means to sabotage the cause of the people of Inner Mongolia, especially trying to use some of our shortcomings in our work to carry out various provocative conspiracies. Therefore, you should educate cadres and the broad masses of the people, improve their sense of smell, distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, and prevent special agents and reactionary elements from carrying out various conspiracies to sabotage the victorious cause of the people of Inner Mongolia.

    III. Current Policies of the Inner Mongolia Party

    You have done many good things for the people of Inner Mongolia, but in a very short period of time (about two months) during the land distribution movement, serious left-leaning deviations also occurred. For example, land was divided equally in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas and individual pastoral areas. Industry and commerce have also been infringed upon. In some places, the masses did not have a clear grasp in the struggle against Mongolian traitors and local tyrants, and there were cases of wrongful killings. In some places, there were behaviors of demolishing temples, burning scriptures, and beating lamas, etc. This is mainly because our leading cadres had a very poor understanding of the complex situation in Inner Mongolia and committed the errors of subjective impatience and tailism. Some comrades had the so-called "grab whatever you can" mentality (Stalin once called this kind of impatience "cavalry-style attacks of 'immediate communization'"), and lacked in-depth understanding and analysis of Inner Mongolia's specific economic environment, class structure, historical culture, customs, and all other characteristics, as well as the psychology and feelings of the people, mechanically transplanting the set of practices from the Han areas. The new Mongolian cadres lacked experience, and their blindness was very great. Some, due to concerns about their family background, did not openly express their opinions and had serious flattering tendencies, failing to take a more responsible attitude towards the people. When these two situations are combined, it inevitably adds fuel to the fire, making it easier for things to go wrong.

    Marxism, Mao Zedong's way of thinking, and the setbacks encountered in practical work teach us: in implementing the Party's various policies in Inner Mongolia and carrying out an important measure, we must differentiate different regions and different situations to make them suitable for each specific environment. We must take into account ethnic characteristics, the awareness of the masses, and the conditions of cadres, and adopt cautious, gradual, step-by-step, and sequential working methods. Otherwise, "good intentions will not be rewarded," and it may seem revolutionary, but it is actually not revolutionary. For example, religion is a mass and historical issue, and even the Soviet Union still has its remnants to this day. However, some of our comrades forced Mongolians to destroy Buddhist statues. As a result, the masses dug holes in the walls, hid the Buddha statues inside, covered them with mud on the outside, and kowtowed to them as usual. These comrades did not understand the truth and even boasted that this had "eliminated superstition." What a naive behavior! Such naive behavior, such subjective impatience and recklessness, must be avoided in the future.

    Regarding the fundamental question of who to strike and who to unite in Inner Mongolia, many cadres have not understood it in the past. The basic revolutionary forces in Inner Mongolia are workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, herdsmen, revolutionary intellectuals, and all other working people. This is the main body of the Inner Mongolian ethnic group. However, those who support the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government and agree with democratic reforms should be united in order to establish a broad Inner Mongolian ethnic anti-Chiang and anti-American united front and concentrate forces to strike at a small number of major Mongolian traitors and evil gentry.

    Starting from this fundamental viewpoint, after research by the Inner Mongolia Party Committee and everyone, the basic policies of the revolution in Inner Mongolia at this stage should mainly include the following points:

    (1) Recognize that land and pastures within Inner Mongolia are owned by the Inner Mongolian ethnic group. Abolish the feudal land ownership and pasture ownership in Inner Mongolia.

    (2) Abolish all privileges of the feudal class (not bearing civic obligations, forced conscription, unpaid labor, private purchase of public land, etc.), abolish the slave system, and declare all slaves completely liberated, enjoying completely equal civil rights.

    (3) Abolish all debts owed by landlords, princes, and usurers to poor peasants and herdsmen in rural areas before land reform. However, debts between hired poor and middle peasants and herdsmen, and debts between commercial transactions, are not included in the abolition.

    (4) Implement "land to the tiller" in agricultural areas. All land originally occupied by feudal landlords and temples shall be confiscated and made public, and distributed uniformly among all landless and land-poor Mongolian and Han people according to population. The land of general Mongolian rich peasants should not be touched, and middle peasants should be resolutely protected. After land distribution, all classes of people should immediately recognize that they have the right to freely manage, buy, sell, and lease the land they have obtained and retained under specific conditions.

    (5) Implement the protection of herds, protection of pastures, and freedom of grazing in pastoral areas. On the premise of benefiting both herdsmen and herd owners, improve the economic lives of herdsmen and develop animal husbandry step by step.

    (6) Develop agriculture and animal husbandry in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas. Appropriately improve the lives of poor peasants and herdsmen.

    (7) Abolish Mongolian rent (Note 1). Mongolian and Han people should have equal fair burdens and civic obligations to the autonomous government.

    (8) Mongolian people have freedom of religious belief. Lamas are not allowed to have privileges outside of being citizens.

    (9) Strengthen the unity of the Mongolian and Han people. Mongolian, Han, and other ethnic people within Inner Mongolia are all equal.

    In addition, different specific policies should be adopted in different regions. The land, plowing cattle, and property of landlords in agricultural areas should be confiscated and distributed equally, while still leaving the same share as farmers. Major Mongolian traitors and evil gentry will not be distributed, only the land and property of small landlords who rent out "household land" (Note 2) will generally not be touched. Except for evil gentry and wealthy farmers, the land and property of general Mongolian rich peasants will not be touched, and those who have already been distributed will maintain the status quo. Middle peasants will be resolutely untouched, only receiving and not giving out. In semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas where farmers are dominant, the large "ridge land" (Note 3) and plowing cattle of large landlords will be equally distributed, but herds will not be distributed. Small landlords and rich peasants will not be touched. "Scatter land" (Note 4) will not be distributed. In areas where animal husbandry is dominant, the plowing cattle of large herd owners will be distributed to farmers, but plowing cattle and livestock must be strictly distinguished, and the dispersal of herds is strictly prohibited. The land, livestock, and property of individual major Mongolian traitors and evil gentry may be confiscated with the approval of the league-level or higher government, and the land may be distributed to farmers and herdsmen who are willing to cultivate land. However, for livestock, efforts should be made to avoid dismantling herds, and the government should manage them uniformly, organize herdsmen to graze, and appropriately improve the lives of farmers and herdsmen. The direction of economic development in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, whether agriculture or animal husbandry, should be decided based on the voluntary wishes of the masses and natural conditions, and pastures should be protected. In pastoral areas, all privileges of princes, nobles, and the upper class should be abolished, and the slave system should be abolished. On the premise of benefiting both herdsmen and herd owners, wages of herdsmen should be appropriately increased step by step, and the herding system should be improved. Except for major Mongolian traitors and evil gentry who may have their livestock and property confiscated by the government with the approval of the league-level or higher government, general large landlords will not be struggled against or distributed. Democratic reforms should be implemented step by step, democratic governments should be established, the livestock economy should be developed, and pastures should be protected.

    The above policies are mainly based on the current objective and subjective conditions, ethnic characteristics, economic nature, mass awareness, and cadre conditions in Inner Mongolia. Ignoring these, we will make mistakes.

    Note 1: "Mongolian rent" was a slight burden in the form of land tax that the Han people imposed on the Mongolian people in the past.
    Note 2: "Household land" is a small amount of land that Mongolian princes bestowed on their subordinates who served them.
    Note 3: "Ridge land" is a type of cultivated land that is more agriculturalized in Mongolia. This type of cultivated land is very fertile, and after artificial arrangement into ridges, it is fixed for perennial cultivation and not abandoned.
    Note 4: "Scatter land" is unfixed cultivated land. Grassland is cleared and seeds are scattered, without plowing or tilling, and it is abandoned after harvesting.

    IV. Strengthen the Unity of Mongolian and Han Cadres

    This conference reflects that there is still a major problem in the ideological understanding of new and old Mongolian and Han cadres, that is, there are still deviations in the understanding of ethnic issues. This deviation manifests itself in the form of the relationship between Mongolian and Han cadres, as well as the issue of leadership relations (the heads of Party organizations in several leagues and banners in Inner Mongolia are mostly old Han cadres), and in essence, it is an issue of nationalist tendencies. How to solve this problem in terms of ideological principles is one of the important tasks of the Inner Mongolia Party at present. If this problem cannot be solved well, everything else will be difficult to solve, and the revolutionary wheel of Inner Mongolia cannot move forward smoothly.

    The vast majority of Han cadres working in Inner Mongolia are hardworking and have made achievements, and the relationship between Mongolian and Han cadres is basically united. However, Han cadres are prone to having a sense of superiority as a major ethnic group, prone to being accustomed to the set of practices in Han areas, prone to looking down on or distrusting Mongolian cadres, feeling that the new Mongolian cadres "have not been tested," and not good at adopting a humble and consultative attitude when dealing with them, but often acting as substitutes and not respecting Mongolian cadres, even randomly labeling them. During the land distribution, under the influence of left-leaning ideas, some banner governments were virtually abolished, only hanging the sign of the county government and issuing county government announcements entirely in Chinese. Some Mongolian primary schools were also closed. Later, when correcting deviations, some places did not compensate Mongolian middle peasants when compensating middle peasants. The responsible comrade in one place even believed that Mongolians could not cultivate land and advocated "dividing good land to Han people and bad land to Mongolians." In the joint Mongolian-Han army units, there were incidents of not allowing Mongolian soldiers to speak Mongolian. Although these are individual examples, they deserve our serious attention. In addition, Han cadres are not settled and have a serious "five-day official" and "sojourner" mentality. Therefore, they cannot actively communicate with Mongolian comrades, cannot wholeheartedly study the Mongolian situation, are unwilling to learn the Mongolian language and script, and cannot delicately appreciate the psychology and feelings of Mongolian comrades.

    The ideological essence of the above situations, no matter how different their manifestations, no matter how light or severe their degree, can be said to be remnants of Han chauvinism or influenced by Han chauvinism. Stalin criticized this kind of great-nation chauvinism, saying: "The Great Russian communists working in the border areas, who grew up under the living conditions of the 'strong nation,' do not know about ethnic oppression. Therefore, they often underestimate the significance of ethnic characteristics in the work of the Party, or completely disregard these characteristics, and do not take into account the class composition, cultural life, and past historical characteristics of certain ethnic groups in their work, making the Party's policy on ethnic issues vulgarized and thus distorted. The result of this situation is the abandonment of communism and a tendency towards great-nation spirit, colonialism, and Great Russian xenophobic patriotism" (Theses on the National Question at the Tenth Congress of the CPSU(B)). This accusation seems to be directed at the situation of many of our comrades today.

    Many comrades may be very unconvinced by what I said. Of course, comrades who commit these ideological problems generally do so unconsciously. They have lived in the liberated areas for a long time and have a set of ready-made work styles and methods, some of which are fine in general liberated areas, but problems arise when they are applied to Inner Mongolia. Han comrades should first get rid of the sojourner mentality, wholeheartedly do good deeds for the people of Inner Mongolia, and serve them for a long time. Mao Zedong's stipulation of serving the people does not distinguish between Han, Mongolian, or Hui people. "Communists should actively help the broad masses of the people of all minority ethnic groups... to strive for their political, economic, and cultural liberation and development" ("On Coalition Government"); "The proletariat must resolutely and actively help the national liberation movement of oppressed or dependent nations" (Stalin). This is the basic position of Marxists-Internationalists on ethnic issues. Han cadres should understand the great significance of your work, work with peace of mind, and resolutely overcome the above-mentioned ideological biases. Learn the Mongolian language and script, pay attention to ethnic forms, deeply appreciate the psychology and feelings of the Mongolian masses and Mongolian cadres, study and analyze the social conditions in Inner Mongolia, be determined to help Mongolian comrades, and humbly learn from them to do a better job.

    Mongolian new cadres generally have many advantages. They generally work actively, struggle hard, and are able to obey the decisions of higher-level organizations. They have done a lot of work. The future development of the Inner Mongolia Party mainly relies on them, because the number of old cadres in Inner Mongolia is limited. However, some of them still have some erroneous ideas in their thinking. The basic link among them is the vague class standpoint, easily equating nationality with class, saying that "national struggle is glorious, class struggle is narrow," saying that the Communist Party is a "Han Party," and "the Inner Mongolia Communist Party was established by Han people," etc., and sometimes not adopting a positive and welcoming attitude towards the help of Han comrades. These ideas are fundamentally wrong, non-Marxist, and do not understand the connection between national struggle and class struggle, and do not understand that true national struggle is essentially class struggle. The proletariat is the most advanced class among the working people, and it represents the interests of all working people, and the working people are the main body of the nation. The main body of the Inner Mongolian ethnic group are workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, herdsmen, and all other manual and intellectual workers. The task of the Inner Mongolia Party is to serve the working people of the entire Inner Mongolia and do good deeds. There is no other purpose than this. Therefore, every revolutionary who is loyal to the people of Inner Mongolia should unconditionally trust the Inner Mongolia Communist Party and eliminate all doubts. Regarding the issue that the liberation and development of Inner Mongolia must have external assistance, I have already talked about it a lot earlier. The reason why Inner Mongolian comrades still have these incorrect and narrow ideas today is mainly due to the long-term oppression and rule of foreign invaders, which naturally created a kind of "self-defense instinct" in their thinking and feelings towards their own ethnic group (this kind of thinking and feeling is completely correct towards foreign invaders). Stalin also analyzed this situation:

    "Local communists, who have gone through the difficult period of national oppression and have not completely gotten rid of the nightmare of national oppression, often exaggerate the significance of ethnic characteristics in the work of the Party, abandon the class interests of the workers, or simply equate the interests of the workers of that ethnic group with the 'national' interests of that ethnic group, and do not know how to separate the former from the latter, and build the work of the Party based on the interests of the workers. This situation again leads to the abandonment of communism and a tendency towards bourgeois democratic nationalism." (Ibid.) In addition, some comrades from Mongolian intellectual backgrounds are prone to complacency and arrogance, and are eager to achieve success and like to boast. Everyone should understand that it is right to have achievements in work. Doing a good job and serving the people is the duty of a Communist Party member. All credit should be attributed to the people. Without the labor of the masses, how can a few Communist Party members do anything well? We must never learn the ruling class's view above the people. The individual, I, is always small. Only the people are great. We should learn more from the masses and sum up experience in our work to educate ourselves. Comrades from intellectual backgrounds should not overemphasize the role of intellectuals. Inner Mongolia has few intellectuals, which is very valuable, and their role is great. The Inner Mongolia Party attaches great importance to them, but the basic driving force of the revolution is the workers and peasants, and we should advance together with the workers and peasants. Comrades from intellectual backgrounds should remember to stand firm on the class standpoint and always remember to serve the workers and peasants. In the future, we should adopt a more responsible and cautious attitude towards the people. Only those who are infinitely loyal and honest to the people and the Party will make rapid progress.

    The two tendencies of bourgeois Han chauvinism and bourgeois narrow nationalism are currently quite prevalent among Mongolian and Han cadres to a certain extent. It has become an obstacle to our progress, and we must resolutely fight against these two tendencies. Han cadres should resolutely take on the struggle against Han chauvinism and carry it through to the end. Mongolian cadres should resolutely take on the struggle against narrow nationalism and carry it through to the end. It should be pointed out that the former struggle is even more important, because the heads of Party organizations in some places are still mostly Han comrades. Only by carrying out these two struggles well can the unity of Mongolian and Han cadres be fundamentally resolved.

    V. Which Things Should Be Done Well in the Future?

    The overall tasks of the Inner Mongolia Party in the future have been discussed earlier. Now, let's talk about a few important current tasks.

    (1) The army will not be expanded further at present. The current task of the Inner Mongolia People's Liberation Army is mainly how to improve the quality of the troops, so that the Inner Mongolia People's Liberation Army can become a more class-conscious, combat-effective, and strictly disciplined Mao Zedong-style people's army. To this end, in addition to running the Inner Mongolia Military and Political University well, each division must also run short-term training classes to train in-service cadres in rotation, and pay special attention to worker-peasant cadres. We must strengthen political work, strengthen class education, discipline education, and learn to do mass work. Instead of rigidly transplanting the practices of the Han areas, we should use Inner Mongolia's ethnic forms and vivid, concrete materials to conduct education. Military education should focus on practical combat experience, carry forward the excellent historical tradition of bravery and fearlessness of the Mongolian cavalry, and build such a capable and loyal army to serve the people of Inner Mongolia, which is of extremely great significance to the liberation and development of Inner Mongolia.

    (2) Run a Party school and systematically and step by step improve new and old cadres from the perspective of policy theory and practical work. We must overcome the tendency of the lower levels to be unwilling to transfer cadres for study, and we must look further. Even if the work is temporarily affected, it must be tolerated. All aspects should cultivate and promote talents as much as possible. It is necessary to plan to train a number of urgently needed technical personnel, and a number of intellectuals can be sent to various specialized technical schools in the Northeast to study. Senior cadres should strengthen theoretical study, study the Party's ethnic policy, study the Marxist-Leninist theory on ethnic issues, and combine it with the various specific policies in Inner Mongolia. It should be known that improving the quality of cadres is the decisive key to all work in Inner Mongolia today.

    (3) Strengthen economic construction and earnestly promote prosperity and eliminate disadvantages for the people of Inner Mongolia. About three-quarters of the population of Inner Mongolia is in agricultural areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas where agriculture is dominant. Therefore, we should mainly focus on developing agriculture, so that the Mongolian people's cultivation techniques can gradually catch up with the Han people and increase agricultural production. In addition, great efforts should be made to develop animal husbandry, and various methods should be used to breed livestock, such as improving breeds, training veterinarians, epidemic prevention, wolf hunting, and building grass sheds; at the same time, it is strictly forbidden to slaughter female livestock, and inappropriate collection of livestock should be opposed. The government should organize the development of fair trade between Mongolians and Han, conscientiously run cooperatives well from top to bottom, lend the production and living materials needed by the Mongolian and Han people at low prices, and fairly purchase all the goods of the Mongolian and Han people, so as to gradually eliminate the improper and excessive intermediary exploitation of private Han merchants. Light industries such as wool weaving and leather should start to be carefully run in a few places and several factories should be opened first, based on the possible conditions, to gain experience, train cadres, and gradually promote various economic constructions. We must prevent false reports, coercive orders, and formalism at the lower levels. We must resolutely oppose various agricultural socialist ideas. Remember not to rigidly transplant the set of practices from the Han areas, and do not do things that are difficult and unrewarding. If we cannot do good deeds in economic terms, if cattle and sheep still die, if Mongolians still suffer losses from merchants when buying things, and if they are still not able to eat and dress warmly, why should the people of Inner Mongolia support the autonomous government?

    (4) Strengthen cultural construction, run more national schools, and run several middle schools well. Mongolian language must be widely used, and more books and publications in Mongolian should be published to fight against the tendency to despise ethnic languages. Strengthen medical and health work, train more medical cadres, reform lama doctors, and advocate hospitals and doctors to go to the countryside and pastoral areas to reduce the death rate of the population in pastoral areas.

    On the basis of doing these few things well, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government will be better developed and consolidated. The unified autonomous government is the result of the struggle of the people of Inner Mongolia. The Inner Mongolia Party should strengthen the construction of governments at all levels in all aspects, especially the construction of grassroots governments, so that they are more heartily loved by the people of Inner Mongolia in terms of content and form.

    What the Party asks of everyone is to wholeheartedly serve the people of Inner Mongolia, and to do the above things well. To ensure that this requirement is realized, in addition to strengthening the training of cadres in ideology and policy, we also need to establish a good work style. Therefore, various bureaucratic tendencies existing in the leading organs and cadres at present, such as floating above, not going deep into the lower levels, not understanding the situation, and being careless, need to be vigorously overcome. We must advocate that cadres and intellectuals truly go deep into the masses, go to the agricultural areas, and also go to the pastoral areas, to truly bury themselves in hard work, and study how to organize and educate Mongolians to cultivate land as well as the Han people, learn various sideline productions, learn how to run factories, and study how to breed cattle and sheep and how to raise babies well. You should not be empty politicians, but true politicians who are capable of concretely doing good things for the broad masses of the people of Inner Mongolia, and politicians who can do good things for the people of Inner Mongolia today and tomorrow.

    I believe that under the leadership of Chairman Yun, the Inner Mongolia Party and the autonomous government, with all Party members closely united around Chairman Yun, will surely be able to overcome difficulties and advance victoriously.

　　在内蒙干部会议上的讲话
    高岗
    一九四八年八月三日
    云泽同志在这个会上的总结报告很好，东北局完全同意。我在这里讲五个问题。就是内蒙解放道路和党的民族政策；内蒙工作的现状；内蒙党当前的政策；加强蒙汉干部的团结；今后的任务。
    一、内蒙解放道路和党的民族政策
    大家的发言说明一个问题：内蒙解放那条路走不通，哪条路才走得通。内蒙人民几百年来，受尽了异族侵略者残酷的统治压迫。满清、北洋军阀、国民党反动派、日本帝国主义者，都以各种残酷毒辣的办法，向内蒙人民刮油水，而内蒙的封建统治阶级则帮着刮。这就将一个历史上的剽悍著称的民族，弄成皮包骨头，衰弱不堪，一天天走向衰亡的道路。扫除外来的民族压迫，和内部的封建压迫，这是内蒙人民多年来的迫切要求。但是为什么在过去老是达不到目的呢？这除了外在的原因之外，象大家所说的，主要地是由于内蒙的封建统治者引狼入室，打着“自治”的招牌，勾结异族侵略者、出卖民族利益、以巩固其特权地位。如德穆楚克（德王）、李守信、白云梯、吴鹤龄等蒙奸，便是这种人物的代表。每个朝代出卖内蒙土地的是他们，叛变和破坏民族解放运动的是他们，和张作霖、吴俊升结亲家的是他们，到蒋介石门下去做官的是他们，帮助日寇奴役内蒙人民打外蒙兄弟的也是他们。大家可以想想，内蒙的这些封建统治阶级，除开制造落后、愚昧、贫穷、困苦、衰弱，除开搜刮民脂民膏维持他们自己的特殊生活外，有没有真正替内蒙人民办过一件好事呢？
    惨痛的历史教训是：依靠封建统治阶级，内蒙人民决不可能得到解放，相反的，只有日益走向被异族侵略者消灭的道路。内蒙一切有正义感的人士，只有坚决与人民站在一起，才能有光明的前途。
    在一九四五年“八一五”以后，内蒙为什么又能获得解放呢？为什么又能建立东西蒙统一的自治政府呢？内蒙人民几百年来的迫切要求为什么能一下达到目的呢？
    这主要是由于苏联外蒙与中国人民解放军的积极帮助，特别是内蒙人民在中国共产党领导下英勇奋斗的结果。没有苏联与外蒙出兵，日本帝国主义能不能迅速打垮？东北和内蒙能不能迅速解放？显然，是不可能的。帮助弱小民族求得解放，这是社会主义国家的天职，是列宁、斯大林规定的国策，外蒙经济上比内蒙还落后，然而他们已解放了二十五年之久，这就是由于有强大的苏联的援助。对于这个外在援助的重大因素，大家应有清楚的认识。
    在苏联和外蒙从内蒙撤兵以后，蒋介石匪帮就在美帝国主义援助下，向中国人民开火，其中也向内蒙人民开火。他们把德王用飞机载到重庆和北平，又把李守信送到东北。傅作义、杜聿明同时向东西蒙进攻。这时一切大小蒙奸，都蠢动起来，一切反动分子仍想继续坐在内蒙人民头上。可是，这一次蒋介石匪徒和内蒙的反动分子却没有达到目的。人民解放军在长城内外，粉碎了蒋匪军的进攻，使得内蒙局势稳定，能够顺利进行各种民主改革。毫无疑问，没有人民解放军在东北、华北、西北和华东、中原的胜利，内蒙将继续被国民党反动派、美帝国主义和内部封建统治者所侵略和奴役。单独依靠内蒙人民自己的力量，要粉碎国民党匪军的进攻是不可能的。对于这第二个外在援助的重大因素，也应有清楚的认识。
    当然，没有内蒙人民自己的努力，选择了正确的解放道路，接受中国共产党的领导，及与人民解放军合作，从而迅速发展了革命力量，内蒙的解放，也是不可能的。
    因此，生动的历史教训是：内蒙只有在苏联与外蒙击败日本的援助之下，只有在中国共产党与人民解放军的领导与帮助之下，只有在内蒙人民自己组织起来当家的条件之下，才能获得真正的解放。大家应拿这些生动的历史事实，来广泛地教育干部和广大人民。
    从内蒙解放的道路证明，我们党的民族政策，是一贯正确始终不渝的。中国共产党自成立以来，即宣布中国境内各民族一律平等，承认各民族自治与自决权，从各方面帮助少数民族的解放与发展。统一的内蒙自治政府，就是经过逐步发展而成立的。内蒙许多盟旗在其先后解放过程中，都曾成立过地方性的自治政府，如抗战时期的绥蒙政府，“八一五”后在已解放的东西各盟旗普遍成立的地方自治政府。现在因为战争的原故，有些盟旗还需暂时委托解放区其他地方政府管理。但是随着形势的开展，内蒙自治政府的统一性必更加强。在全国解放后，则将按照自愿和民主的原则，由中国境内各民族组成中华民主共和国联邦（毛主席“论联合政府”）。内蒙自治政府，将是这个联邦在国境北部的主要组成部分。
    前面讲过，没有先进的兄弟的带有决定性的帮助，内蒙不可能得到解放。但是现在是否可以不需要帮助了呢？毫无疑问，内蒙的军事、政治、经济、文化各方面，还需要长期的大力的帮助。例如，王爷庙发生了瘟疫，就必须由外面派防疫队去；游牧区的畜瘟、花柳病，没有近代医学，是不可能治好的，这就需要外面的帮助。总之，内蒙在各方面都与中国其他部分不可分割，决不可能幻想离开同国内外友邻民族（如汉民族、苏联、外蒙等）的团结帮助，而能够孤立地求得自己的巩固发展。内蒙如果在经济文化各方面，不努力追上汉民族，那么所谓民族平等，也将是落空的。如果内蒙的经济状况，老是停留在“茶布水烟糖，牛马骆驼羊”的水平，那么，经济上的长期依赖，必然造成政治上的长期依赖。这样，内蒙民族实际上就并没有真正获得解放。只有从经济、文化上真正提高，才能有实质上的，而不仅是形式上的民族平等。只有这样，内蒙劳动人民的智慧和优良的历史传统才能自由发展，内蒙民族才有光明前途。
    这就是我们党在过去、现在和将来的坚定不移的政策。内蒙党的每一个同志，都应深刻了解这一点。
    二、内蒙工作的现状
    内蒙工作的现状，要用一句话来说，就是成绩很大，但基础还不够稳固。
    广大内蒙人民，自己选定了在中国共产党领导下的正确的民族解放道路。这是“八一五”以来内蒙工作中最基本的收获。因此，有许多方面取得很大的成绩。
    首先是冲破各种障碍，经过自治联合会的一个准备阶段，终于成立了几百年来未有过的东西蒙统一的真正的人民的自治政府，并创建了内蒙人民自己的军队。这个政府和军队，积极参加了全国的解放战争，配合东北、华北解放军作战，肃清了内部的土匪，保卫了内蒙人民胜利的果实。
    其次，培养了三千多干部，训练了几千知识分子，发展了四千党员，和几千青年团员。在这一基础上，胜利地打垮了内部反动分子的各种破坏抵抗和妥协投降的阴谋。
    再次，农业区进行了土地改革，广大贫苦农民获得土地与耕牛，有了自由发展农业生产的条件。其他半农半牧与游牧区，也在进行各种民主改革。从此，内蒙的经济发展，开始得到了广大范围的自由。
    在多年的曲折斗争过程中，内蒙人民找到了他们自己真正的革命领袖——云泽同志。内蒙任何一个假仁假义的封建上层人物，在云主席的革命立场、光荣历史和工作成效的面前，迅速失去其影响。
    内蒙民族的自尊心、自信心，现在是空前提高了，历史造成的蒙汉民族的隔阂和对立，也在逐渐消除。
    这是内蒙有历史意义的伟大胜利。这是全内蒙人民、内蒙军队、内蒙共产党英勇奋斗得来的胜利。这个胜利奠定了内蒙自治政府今后发展的基础，帮助了全国的革命事业的前进，并且给中国其他少数民族，树立了求解放的榜样。
    但是，现在是否一切事情都办好了，可以高枕无忧了呢？很显然的，还差得很远。内蒙工作的基础，还不够稳固，还有许多问题。
    首先是群众的组织性与觉悟性还差。经济文化方面积极的发展还待极大的努力。游牧区的工作刚开始做。农业区和半农半牧区工作很粗糙，发生了许多偏向，有的地方搞乱了，西蒙还有部分地区没有解放。
    其次，干部的政策水平，思想水平还很低。老干部少，经验也差，能掌握一个局面的不多。新干部提拔快，掌握政策更困难一些。至于管理财政经济建设，以及各种专门技术的干部更为缺乏。西蒙局面进一步打开后，也要准备派一批干部。因此，在干部的质量与数量方面，远赶不上形势的发展，需要努力提高。
    此外，内蒙外部与内部的敌人还存在，美帝国主义及国民党反动派和蒙奸反动分子，对内蒙是决不会死心的。他们和日本帝国主义者一样，很看重内蒙这块反苏反共的前进阵地。他们在内蒙附近设立了专门的特务机关，想尽千方百计，来破坏内蒙人民的事业；特别是想利用我们工作中的某些缺点，来进行各种挑拨阴谋。因之，你们应教育干部，和广大人民，提高嗅觉，分清敌我，防止特务分子和反动分子进行各种阴谋活动，破坏内蒙人民的胜利事业。
    三、内蒙党当前的政策
    你们替内蒙人民办了许多好事，但在平分土地运动的很短时期（约两个月）内，也发生了严重的左的偏向。譬如半农半牧区和个别游牧区，也照样平分土地。工商业也有被侵犯了的。个别地方，群众在反对蒙奸恶霸斗争中，掌握不清，有错杀了人的现象。有的地方，曾发生拆庙焚经打喇嘛的行为等等。这主要是由于我们领导干部，对内蒙的复杂情况了解很差，犯了主观主义急性病和尾巴主义的错误所致。有的同志有所谓“顺手牵羊”的思想（斯大林曾称此种急躁病为“‘马上共产主义化’的骑兵式的袭击”），对内蒙具体的经济环境、阶级结构、历史文化、风俗习惯等一切特点，及人民的心理感情，缺少深入的了解与分析，机械地搬运汉人区的一套。而蒙古新干部更缺乏经验，盲目性很大，有的由于自己的家庭成份的顾虑，不公开提意见，有着严重的迎合性，不能采取对人民更负责的态度。这两种情况一结合，就不免火上加油，事情更易于办糟。
    马克思主义，毛主席的思想方法，和在实际工作中碰的钉子，教导我们：在内蒙实施党的各种政策，与进行一项重要措施，必须分别不同地区，不同情况，使之适合各个具体环境。必须照顾民族特点，群众觉悟和干部条件，采取慎重的、缓进的、有步骤、先后的工作方法。否则，“有好心，无好报”，看起来很革命，实际上不革命。例如宗教，这是一个群众性的历史性的问题，甚至苏联到现在也还有它的残余。而我们有的同志，竟强迫蒙人毁佛像。结果，群众在墙上挖洞，将佛爷藏在里面，外面用泥幕泥上，照旧磕头。这些同志不明真相，还自夸这一下“破除了迷信”，这是何等幼稚的行为！这种幼稚的行为，这种主观主义的急躁轻率现象，今后必须力戒。
    关于在内蒙打击谁、团结谁的这个根本问题，有许多干部过去是没有搞清楚的。内蒙的基本革命队伍是工人、贫雇中农、牧民、革命的知识分子及其他一切劳动人民，这是内蒙民族的主体。但拥护内蒙自治政府，赞成民主改革的人，都应团结在一起，以便建立广泛的内蒙民族的反蒋反美统一战线，集中力量打击少数的大蒙奸，恶霸分子。
    从这个根本观点出发，经过内蒙党委和大家的研究，内蒙现阶段革命的基本政策，主要应包括以下几点：
    （１）承认内蒙境内的土地与牧场，为内蒙民族所有。废除内蒙封建的土地所有制，与牧场所有制。
    （２）废除封建阶级一切特权（不负担公民义务、强迫征役、无偿劳动、私买公地等），废除奴隶制度、一切奴隶宣告完全解放，享有完全平等的公民权利。
    （３）废除土地改革前农村中一切地主、王公、高利贷对贫苦农民与牧民的一切债权。但雇贫中农与牧民间的债务，商业买卖间的债务，不在废除之列。
    （４）农业区实行耕者有其田，原来一切封建地主与庙宇所占有的土地，一律收归公有，按人口统一份配给所有无地和少地的蒙汉人民。对蒙古一般富农的土地不动，坚决保护中农。土地分配后，应即承认各阶层人民对于其所分得与保留之土地，有自由经营、买卖与在特定条件下出租之权。
    （５）牧畜区实行保护牧群，保护收场，放牧自由。在牧民与牧主两利的前提下，有步骤的改善牧民的经济生活，发展畜牧。
    （６）在半农半牧区，发展农业，发展畜牧。适当的提高贫苦农民与牧民的生活。
    （７）取消蒙租（注一）。蒙汉人民对于自治政府，应有同等的公平负担与公民义务。
    （８）蒙古人民信教自由。喇嘛不许有公民以外的特权。
    （９）加强蒙汉人民的团结，在内蒙境内的蒙汉人民及其他民族的人民，一律平等。
    此外，在不同地区应采取不同的具体政策。农业区地主的土地耕畜财产没收平分，同时必须留给与农民同等的一份。大蒙奸恶霸只本人不分，出租户口地（注二）之小地主，其财产不分，其土地一般不动。蒙人除恶霸大富农外，一般富农的土地财产不动，已分者维持现状。中农坚决不动，只分进，不分出。半农半牧区农民占优势者，大地主的大垄地（注三）与耕畜，实行平分，牧群不分。小地主与富农不动。漫撒地（注四）一律不分。牧业占优势者，大牧主的耕畜分给农民，但耕畜与牧畜必须严加区分，并严禁分散牧群。个别大蒙奸恶霸的土地、牲畜、财产经盟以上政府批准没收后，土地可分给农民及愿种地之牧民。但对于牧畜，应作到不拆散牧群，由政府统一管理，组织牧民放牧，适当改善农牧民的生活。半农半牧区经济发展方向，为农业或牧业，依据群众自愿与自然条件决定，并应保护牧场。游牧区废除王公贵族上层的一切特权，废除奴隶制度。在牧民牧主两利的前提下，有步骤地适当提高牧工工资，改善牧放制度。除大蒙奸恶霸经盟以上政府批准，可以没收其牲畜财产由政府处理外，一般大地主一律不斗不分。有步骤地实行民主改革，建立民主政权，发展畜牧经济，保护牧场。
    以上这些政策，主要是根据今天内蒙主客观情况，民族特点，经济性质，群众觉悟和干部条件提出的。忽视这些，我们就会犯错误。
    注一：“蒙租”为过去汉人对蒙人一种田赋式的轻微负担。
    注二：“户口地”是蒙古王公赏赐给其下属当差者的少部土地。
    注三：“大垄地”是蒙古比较农业化的一种耕田。此项耕地很肥美，经过人工整理垄段，固定常年耕种不扔者。
    注四：“漫撒地”是不固定的耕地，将草地开出撒下种子，不锄不翻，收割后就把它扔了。
    四、加强蒙汉干部团结
    这次会议，反映蒙汉新老干部中思想认识上还存在一个重大的问题，这就是对待民族问题的认识上尚有偏差，这种偏差在形式上表现为蒙汉干部关系问题，以及领导关系问题（内蒙若干盟旗党的负责人多是汉人老干部），而在实质上是民族主义倾向问题。如何在思想原则上解决这个问题，这是内蒙党当前的重要任务之一。这个问题如不能很好解决，其他一切工作，一切问题就都不好解决，内蒙的革命车轮，就不能顺利前进。
    在内蒙工作的汉人干部，绝大部分是努力的，有成绩的，蒙汉干部关系，基本上也是团结的。但是汉人干部容易有大民族的优越感，容易习惯汉人区的一套做法，容易看不起或不相信蒙古干部，觉得蒙古的新干部“未经过考验”，不善于对他们采取遇事虚心商量和耐心帮助的态度，而往往包办代替，不尊重蒙古干部，甚至给他们乱扣帽子。平分土地时，在左倾影响之下，有的旗政府无形中取消了，只挂县政府的牌子，出完全汉文的县政府的布告，蒙古小学也有停办了的。后来在纠正偏向时，又有个别地方在补偿中农时，不补偿蒙古中农。有一个地方的负责同志，甚至认为蒙古人不会种地，主张“好地分给汉人，坏地分给蒙人”。蒙汉联军部队里面，发生不许蒙古兵说蒙古话的事情。这些虽属个别例子，但值得我们严重注意。此外，汉人干部不安心，“五日京兆”、“作客思想”相当严重。因此就不能积极沟通与蒙古同志的关系，不能专心一意研究蒙古情况，不愿学习蒙古语言文字，不能细致体会蒙古同志的心理感情。
    以上这些情况，不论其表现形式如何不同，不论其程度的轻重，其思想实质可说都是大汉族主义的残余，或受了大汉族主义的影响。斯大林曾批评过这种大民族主义思想说：“在边疆工作的大俄罗斯共产主义者，他们是在‘强国’民族生存条件之下长大的，不知有民族的压迫。因此他们往往缩小了民族特点在党的工作中的意义，或是完全没有顾及到这些特点，在自己的工作中未考虑到某一些民族的阶级构成、文化生活、过去历史的特点，使党对民族问题的政策庸俗化，因而加以曲解。这种情形，其结果便弄成放弃共产主义，倾向于大国精神，殖民主义，大俄罗斯排外爱国主义方面”（联共十次大会民族主义报告提纲）。这一指责，就好象是对着我们今天许多同志的情况说的。
    我这样一说，许多同志也许会很不服。当然，犯这些思想毛病的同志，一般都是不知不觉犯的。他们过去长期在解放区生活，有了一套现成的作风和工作方法，其中有些在一般解放区本来没问题的，但一用到内蒙来，就发生问题了。汉人同志首先应该去掉作客思想，一心一意为内蒙人民办好事，长期的服务。毛主席规定的为人民服务，是不分汉人、蒙人或回人的。“共产党人应当积极地帮助各少数民族的广大人民群众………………争取他们在政治上、经济上、文化上的解放与发展”（论联合政府）；“无产阶级必须坚决地积极地帮助被压迫的或依赖的民族的民族解放运动”（斯大林）。这是马克思主义者——国际主义者在民族问题上的基本立场。汉人干部应了解你们工作的伟大意义，要安心工作，同时应坚决克服上述各种思想的偏向。学习蒙古语言文字，注意民族形式，深刻体会蒙古群众与蒙古干部的心理感情，研究分析内蒙的社会情况，决心帮助蒙古同志，并向他们虚心学习把工作做得更好。
    蒙古新干部一般地有许多优点。他们一般地工作积极，艰苦奋斗，能够服从上级组织的决定。他们作了许多工作。内蒙党今后的发展，主要依靠他们，因为内蒙的老干部数量有限。但他们中间有的同志在思想上还有一些错误的观念。其中基本的一环是阶级立场模糊，容易把民族与阶级对立起来，说什么“民族斗争光荣，阶级斗争狭隘”，说共产党是“汉人党”，“内蒙共产党是汉人建立的”等等，对汉人同志的帮助，有时不是采取积极欢迎的态度。这些思想都是根本错误的，非马克思主义的，不了解民族斗争与阶级斗争的联系，不了解真正的民族斗争，实质上就是阶级斗争。无产阶级是劳动人民中间最先进的阶级，它是代表一切劳动人民的利益的，而劳动人民是民族的主体。内蒙民族的主体是工人、贫雇中农、牧民和其他一切体力与智力劳动人民。党是阶级的代表，也是民族的代表。内蒙党的任务，就是为全内蒙的劳动人民办事，办好事。只有这一条，别无其他。因此，每一个忠于内蒙人民的革命者，都应对内蒙共产党无条件信任，去掉一切怀疑。关于内蒙的解放与发展，必须有外力帮助的问题，前面已经讲了许多。内蒙同志之所以到今天还存在这些不正确的狭隘的思想，主要是长期受异族侵略者压迫统治，自然造成对本民族一种“卫护本能”式的思想感情所致（这种思想感情，对异族侵略者是完全正确的）。斯大林对这种情况也曾加分析：
    “当地共产主义者，他们曾经过民族压迫的困苦时期，还没有完全解脱民族压迫的梦魔，往往夸大了民族特点在党的工作中的意义，放弃了劳动者的阶级利益，或是简简单单地把该民族的劳动者的利益跟该民族的‘全民’利益混为一谈，不会把前者从后者之中分别出来，而根据劳动者的利益去建立党的工作，这种情形又弄成放弃共产主义，而倾向于资产阶级民主的民族主义方面。”（同前）此外，有些蒙古知识分子出身的同志，容易自满自骄，遇事急于求成，好大喜功。大家应当了解，工作有成绩是应该的，把工作做好，为人民服务，是共产党员的天职，一切功劳应归功于人民。没有群众的劳动，试问单单几个共产党员能办好什么事？我们决不能学习统治阶级在人民之上的观点，个人、我，总是渺小的，只有人民才是伟大的。我们应多向群众学习，多在工作中总结经验，教育自己。知识分子出身的同志，不要过分强调知识分子的作用。内蒙知识分子少，很可贵，作用很大，内蒙党很重视，但革命的基本动力是工农，应该与工农一道前进。知识分子出身的同志应切记站稳阶级立场，切记总应是替工农劳动人民办事，今后应采取对人民更负责更谨慎的态度。只有对人民对党无限忠诚与老实的人，才会很快进步。
    资产阶级的大汉族主义与资产阶级的狭隘民族主义这两种倾向，目前在蒙汉干部中，在一定意义上说，是相当普遍存在的。它成为我们前进的障碍物，我们必须坚决与这两种倾向作斗争。汉人干部应自己坚决担负起反对大汉族主义的斗争，把它进行到底；蒙古干部应自己坚决担负起反对狭隘民族主义的斗争，把它进行到底。应该指出，前一种斗争，关系更加重大，因为在若干地方党的负责人，目前还多是汉人同志。只有把这两种斗争进行得好，蒙汉干部的团结，才能从根本上得到解决。
    五、今后要办好哪几件事？
    关于内蒙党今后的总任务。前面已讲过，现在提出当前几件重要工作谈一谈。
    （一）目前不再扩大部队。内蒙解放军现在的任务主要的是如何提高部队的质量，使内蒙人民解放军更加成为一支有阶级觉悟的、并有战斗力的、有严格纪律的毛泽东式的人民军队。为此，除把内蒙军政大学办好外，各师还必须办短期训练班，轮流训练在职干部，并特别注意工农干部。要加强政治工作，加强阶级教育、纪律教育和学会做群众工作。不是硬搬汉人区的一套，而是通过内蒙的民族形式，用生动活泼具体材料进行教育。军事教育应着重实战经验，发扬蒙古骑兵剽悍无畏的优良历史传统，建立这样一支精干的忠实为内蒙人民服务的军队，对内蒙的解放与发展具有极其重大的意义。
    （二）办一个党校，有计划有步骤地把新老干部从政策理论上，从实际工作上提高一步。要克服下面不愿抽调干部学习的偏向，眼光要放远一些，即使工作暂时受些影响，也必须忍受。各方面要多多培养提拔人材。要有计划地训练一批迫切需要的技术人员，可以输送一批知识分子到东北各种专门技术学校学习。高级干部要加强理论学习，学习党的民族政策，学习马列主义关于民族问题的理论，并与内蒙当前各种具体政策相结合。须知干部质量的提高，是今天内蒙一切工作的决定关键。
    （三）加强经济建设，切实为内蒙人民兴利除弊。内蒙人口约四分之三在农业区和农业占优势的半农半牧区，因之应以主要力量发展农业，使蒙人耕作技术能逐渐赶上汉人，增加农作产量。此外，要用很大力量发展畜牧业，用各种方法繁殖牲畜，如改良畜种、训练畜医、防疫、打狼、割草盖圈棚等；同时严禁宰杀母畜，反对不适当征收牲畜。政府应有组织地发展蒙汉间公平贸易，由上而下地切实办好合作社，廉价地借给蒙汉人民所需用的生产资料与生活资料，公道地收买蒙汉人民所有的商品，以便逐渐消灭汉人私商中那些不正当的过分的中间剥削。毛织、皮革等轻工业要依据可能条件先开始在几个地方认真办好和开办几个工厂，取得经验训练干部，逐步推广各种经济建设。要防止下面的假报告，强迫命令和形式主义。要坚决反对各种各样农业社会主义思想。切记不要硬搬汉人区一套，不要做那些费力不讨好的事。如果在经济方面，我们办不出好事来，牛、羊照样死，蒙人买东西照样吃商人的亏，仍旧吃不饱穿不暖，试问内蒙人民为什么要拥护自治政府？
    （四）加强文化建设，多办国民学校，办好几个中学。必须广泛应用蒙文、蒙语，多出一些蒙文的书籍刊物，向轻视民族语文的倾向作斗争。加强医药卫生工作，多培养些医务干部，改造喇嘛医生，提倡医院、医生下乡，到游牧区去，减少游牧区人口的死亡。
    在做好这几件事的基础上，内蒙自治政府就会更好地发展与巩固起来。统一的自治政府，是内蒙人民奋斗的结果。内蒙党应在各方面来加强各级政权，特别是基层政权的建设，使之从内容与形式更加为内蒙人民所衷心爱戴。
    党要求大家的，就是全心全意为内蒙人民服务，就是把以上这些事情办好。要保证这一要求实现，除开干部在思想政策上加强锻炼，还需要建立良好的工作作风。因此，目前在领导机关和干部中存在的浮在上面、不深入下层、不了解情况、粗枝大叶等各种各样官僚主义倾向，需要大力加以克服，我们要提倡干部和知识分子真正深入到群众中去，到农业区去，也到游牧区去，去真正埋头苦干，研究如何组织教育蒙人种地和汉人一样种好，学会各种副业生产，学会办工厂，研究牛羊如何繁殖，娃娃如何能养好。你们不要作空头的政治家，而是要做真正有本事能为广大内蒙人民具体办好事的政治家，能为内蒙人民今天和明天办好事的政治家。
    相信内蒙党和自治政府在云主席领导之下，全体党员紧紧团结在云主席的周围，一定能够克服困难，胜利前进。
