Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. The fake Gold Yuan continues to depreciate dramatically. According to an Associated Press report from Shanghai on October 31st: The black market exchange rate for the fake Gold Yuan in Shanghai has continued to depreciate to 20 yuan per US dollar. The black market price of rice has risen to 140 fake Gold Yuan per bag (approximately 140 catties), which is six times higher than the "August 19th" fixed price of 20 yuan. The Associated Press said: "The rate of depreciation of the Gold Yuan on the black market is now several times faster than that of the old legal tender. The old legal tender never depreciated by more than 50% in one month, but the new Gold Yuan has depreciated from the official rate of 4:1 to 20:1 against the US dollar (i.e., depreciated by 80%) in less than a month." It also said: "The deadline for exchanging foreign currency for Gold Yuan has passed, and no one cares about it. Although it is now illegal to hold gold and US dollars, people would rather hold foreign currency. In fact, many people holding Gold Yuan are paying high prices to buy US dollars." An editorial in the Shanghai-based British newspaper North China Daily News on October 27th pointed out: "The situation in Shanghai today is infinitely worse than during the period of inflation of the old legal tender." Shanghai citizens have realized that the Gold Yuan, which has been tried for two months, is even worse than the legal tender. The trend is, as reported by the Tianjin Yishibao's Shanghai correspondent: "Everyone is clinging to a pile of Gold Yuan notes, watching them gradually depreciate to nothing."

　　伪金圆券继续贬值
  　米价已较“限价”高出六倍
    【新华社陕北五日电】伪金圆券继续剧烈贬值。据美联社上海十月三十一日消息：上海黑市伪金圆券已继续贬值到每二十元兑换美金一元。黑市米价每袋（约合一百四十斤）已涨达一百四十伪金圆券，比“八一九”限价二十元高出了六倍。美联社说：“现在黑市场上金圆的贬值率，比起旧法币来要快几倍。旧法币还从来没有在一个月内贬值百分之五十以上，但新金圆不到一个月已由四比一美元官价贬到二十比一美元（即已贬值百分之八十）。”又说：“外币兑换金圆的限期已过，无人理会这件事。尽管现在握有黄金与美钞就算违法，但人们宁可握有外币。事实上，许多握有金圆的人，正在出高价买美钞。”上海英商字林西报十月二十七日社论指出：“今天的上海情形较诸旧法币膨胀期间还要无限恶化。”上海市民觉察到已试用两月的金圆比法币结果还坏。其趋势，正如天津益世报驻上海记者所报导的：“大家死抱住一堆金圆券，眼看着他逐渐的贬值，以至于零。”
