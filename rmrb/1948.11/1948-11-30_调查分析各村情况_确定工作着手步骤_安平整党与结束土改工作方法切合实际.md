　　Investigating and Analyzing the Situation in Various Villages to Determine Steps for Implementation
    Anping's Party Rectification and Land Reform Completion Methods are Practical
    [Our Newspaper News] Reporter Qian Feng reports: Anping County, Hebei Province, has begun its land reform completion and party rectification work at the beginning of this month in eighteen key villages. Regarding how to resolve the order of land reform completion and party rectification in different villages and under different circumstances, the practices of Yan Tuan, Dongguan, and Xingxian villages can provide us with some experience. The specific introductions are as follows:
    Three Approaches in Three Different Villages
    Yan Tuan Village: First, hold a Party branch committee meeting to freely discuss the urgent demands of the masses. Through the introduction of the party's situation by several better party members, and based on the distribution lists when the land was equally divided, examine the current land ownership of all classes in the village. Separately convene meetings of party members, peasant representatives, and the masses to convey the purpose of democratic party rectification and land reform completion. Establish three winter schools in different areas to conduct class education within the winter schools, and collect opinions and reflections from the masses through party members in the winter schools. After only seven days, the cadres had a general understanding of the village's situation. The land in the village has been largely equally divided, and the current land ownership of each class is as follows: landlords average 2.22 mu per person, rich peasants 2.75 mu, middle peasants 2.89 mu, and poor peasants and farm laborers 2.52 mu. In the past, when classifying classes, some middle peasants were classified as rich peasants. Among the nine middle peasant households whose land was taken away, six households had one-quarter of all the land of their families taken away. Some individuals are currently experiencing financial difficulties and need compensation. The allocated land has not yet had its ownership determined, and there are a large number of agricultural implements and floating wealth that have not been distributed. The village's hair-combing (used for weaving Luo silk) sideline industry is very developed. Now, poor peasants and farm laborers are demanding the distribution of floating wealth to expand the capital for sideline production. Middle peasants are demanding to clarify their class status, and those whose interests have been infringed upon need compensation. In short, determining land and property rights is a common demand of the people of all classes. The village branch, after adjustment, is generally able to complete the task of ending land reform. Based on the above situation, the work team decided to start with the work of ending land reform, and carry out party rectification in the process of ending land reform.

    Dongguan Village in the Urban Area: The steps taken by the cadres after arriving in the village were generally similar to those in Yan Tuan. The current land ownership situation in the village is: landlords average 2.51 mu per person, rich peasants 2.86 mu, middle peasants 3.22 mu, and poor peasants and farm laborers 3.66 mu, with the village average being 3.62 mu. Not only has feudalism been completely eliminated, satisfying the demands of the poor peasants and farm laborers, but it has also become an inverted pyramid shape. The main content of land reform completion in the village is to compensate the two middle peasant households whose land was taken away and to distribute floating wealth to determine land ownership. However, the internal situation of the party in the village is relatively chaotic: some party member cadres are selfish and self-serving. For example, when distributing land, it was stipulated that the masses could not change the garden land they received into dry land, and if military dependents changed the garden land into dry land, the substitute cultivation would be canceled. However, the branch secretary himself changed his original garden into dry land and re-divided the garden land from the fruit. In addition, he also secretly exchanged his three mu of bad land for six mu of good land. These have aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the masses. What the masses oppose even more is that much of the floating wealth was lost after being concentrated, including six dou of wheat left over from the village's public grain contribution this summer. The masses suspect that the cadres were playing tricks, but because some cadres and party members concealed the truth and deceived those above, occupying a dominant position in the leadership within and outside the party, most party members and the masses did not dare to openly question it. Based on this situation, the work team believed that it would be impossible to lead the masses to carry out the work of ending land reform without first carrying out party rectification. Therefore, it was decided to first carry out party rectification, combining the completion of land reform with the party rectification process.

    Xingxian Village in the Urban Area: After the land was equally divided in the land reform, feudalism has been eliminated. The land ownership situation of each class is: landlords average 2.17 mu per person, rich peasants 1.9 mu, middle peasants 2.93 mu, and poor peasants and farm laborers 2.73 mu. The floating wealth in the village has not yet been distributed. However, the village suffered from flooding this year, and the harvest was only about 40%, and the masses do not have enough grain to eat and need to quickly develop sideline industries. Out of 182 households in the village, 124 are participating in saltpeter refining. Among the 31 party member cadres, 26 are refining saltpeter. They get up before dawn every day to scrape soil and do not rest until dark, earning a lot of money. The masses are very interested in refining saltpeter. Even when the floating wealth was mentioned, some people replied: "Scraping soil for one more day is more than what is distributed." Based on this situation, the work team decided to end land reform by leading the masses in production.

    From the above three villages, the working methods this time show the following two characteristics: First, more serious attention has been paid to understanding and analyzing the situation than in the past, and the order of land reform completion and party rectification has been resolved based on the objective situation. Second, considerable attention has been paid to delivering weapons of policy such as class division and party rectification to the masses through winter schools, free discussions, and other methods, making the movement more mass-based from the beginning, so the determined policies and practices are more practical and easier to implement. In addition, the work team in Hecao Village in the Eighth District of the county did not pay attention to this method of determining the direction of work based on the situation, but blindly mobilized party members and the masses to hold meetings to discuss whether to end land reform first or carry out party rectification first. The result of this method was that it dragged on the time and did not reach a correct conclusion.

　　调查分析各村情况　确定工作着手步骤
    安平整党与结束土改工作方法切合实际
    【本报讯】记者千峰报导：冀中安平县结束土改及整党工作，月初以来即在十八个重点村开始。关于在不同村庄、不同情况下如何解决结束土改与整党的先后顺序问题，有严疃、东关、兴贤等三村的作法，可提供我们若干经验，兹特分别介绍如下：
    三种不同村的三种作法
    严疃村：先召开党的支委会，漫谈群众中的迫切要求，通过几个较好党员介绍了党内情况，根据平分时的表册考查了全村各阶层目前土地占有情况，分别召开党员会、农代会、群众会，传达了民主整党及结束土改的目的，分片建立了三处冬学，在冬学内进行了划阶级教育，并通过党员在冬学中搜集了群众的意见与反映。这样经过只七天时间，干部对于全村情况有了一个概括的了解。该村土地已大体平分，现在各阶层占有土地情况如下：地主每人平均二亩二分二，富农二亩七分五，中农二亩八分九，贫雇农二亩五分二。过去划阶级时，有的中农被订成富农，被抽动土地的九户中农，有六户抽去了自己全家所有土地的四分之一，个别的目前生活困难，需要给以补偿。已分配土地尚未确定地权，存有大批农具浮财没有分配。村里梳头发（织罗底用）副业很发达，现在贫雇农要求分浮财，扩大副业生产资金；中农要求划清阶级，利益被侵犯的需要补偿。总之，确定地权财产权是各阶层人民的共同要求。该村支部经过调整，一般能完成结束土改任务。工作组根据上述情况，确定了先从结束土改工作着手，从结束土改中进行整党。
    城区东关村：干部到村后经过步骤和严疃大体相似。该村土地占有情况，目前为地主每人平均二亩五分一，富农二亩八分六，中农三亩二分二，贫雇农三亩六分六，全村平均数为三亩六分二。不仅彻底消灭了封建，满足了贫雇农的要求，而且成为倒宝塔的形式。该村结束土改主要的内容，是补偿两户被抽动土地的中农及分浮财，确定地权。但该村党内情况比较混乱：一部分党员干部自私自利，如在分地时规定群众分得园子地不得改成旱田，军属将园子改成旱田，则取消代耕，但支书自己却把原有的园子改成了旱田，从果实中又重分了园子。另外还把自己的三亩坏地偷换了六亩好地。这些都引起群众普遍不满。群众更反对的是许多浮财集中起来后丢了，其中包括今年夏天全村缴公粮余的六斗麦子。群众怀疑干部从中捣鬼，但由于部分干部党员瞒上欺下，在党内党外的领导上占着优势地位，所以一般党员及群众都不敢公开过问。该村工作组根据这种情况，认为如不先进行整党，将不可能领导群众进行结束土改工作。因此确定首先进行整党，将结束土改在整党中结合进行。
    城区兴贤村：土改平分后，已消灭了封建，各阶层占有土地的情况是：地主每人平均二亩一分七，富农一亩九，中农二亩九分三，贫雇农二亩七分三，村中浮财尚未分配。但该村今年遭受水灾，年景只有四成多，群众粮食不够吃，需要很快搞副业。全村一百八十二户，参加熬硝的即有一百二十四户。三十一个党员干部中，熬硝的即有二十六个。他们每天都是鸡叫前起来刮土，一直到天黑才歇，赚钱很多，群众对于熬硝兴趣很高。甚至提到分浮财时也有人回答：“多刮一天土比分的还多”。工作组根据这种情况，就决定通过领导群众生产来进行结束土改。
    从上述三个村看来，此次工作方法上表现着下列两个特点：一是比过去更认真的注意了了解情况与分析情况，并根据客观情况来解决结束土改与整党的先后步骤问题。一是相当的注意了通过冬学、漫谈等方式，将划阶级、整党等方针政策武器交付群众，使运动一开始就更富有群众性，因此决定的方针与做法比较切合实际容易贯彻。另外，该县在八区河漕村的工作组，曾不重视这种根据情况确定工作方向的方法，只是盲目地发动党员和群众开会讨论先结束土改，或先进行整党，这种办法的结果是拖延了时间，得不出正确结论。
