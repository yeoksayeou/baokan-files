Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 1st. A unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army recently launched a "Zhou Heizi Platoon Movement." Strong fighting spirit and flexible tactics are the characteristics of the Zhou Heizi Platoon. In the battle of @ County this spring, the platoon, with its tenacious fighting will and flexible combat maneuvers, resolved the highest command of the enemy defending the city, capturing Major General Commissioner and Security Commander Qiao Weisen and more than 250 others, seizing two mortars, three light and heavy machine guns, two radio stations, one telephone, and 30 million enemy currency. All nine members of the platoon were unharmed, creating a brilliant example of defeating the many with the few. At the celebration meeting of the detachment, it was selected as a "Combat Hero Platoon."

After the city wall of @ County was breached by our army, the enemy retreated to the highest point of the city - the Southwest Mountain. The enemy's highest command was desperately forcing the soldiers to make hopeless resistance, attempting to reorganize firepower based on the fortifications on the mountain. The 5th Company (the company to which the Zhou Heizi Platoon belonged) saw through the enemy's attempt and launched a fierce offensive against the enemy on the mountain, regardless of everything.

The Zhou Heizi Platoon actively requested battle from the company and took the initiative to attack and reinforce neighboring friendly units. When they discovered that a platoon was blocked in the front, they immediately withdrew from the front, maneuvering to the upper left of the enemy's first courtyard, and opened fire on the enemy. The enemy was attacked by firepower from both above and below and had to retreat into the kiln. The platoon then used a small encirclement to divide and annihilate the enemy in the three courtyards. When they moved uphill from the foot of the mountain, the crossfire of the enemy on the mountain and the city wall blocked the attacking road. They immediately covered each other, advanced alternately, and coordinated with shouting to shake the enemy's resolve, finally eliminating all the enemies.

The exemplary deeds of the Zhou Heizi Platoon are inseparable from their class consciousness. Zhou Heizi is from Xiong County, Hebei Province, is twenty years old, and comes from a poor family. He voluntarily joined the army in 1945 and joined the Communist Party of China last winter. The platoon's deputy leader, Lei Xingshun, and soldiers Hao Ke and Liu Haiyun, etc., all came from backgrounds of hired labor and shepherding, suffered the oppression and exploitation of the landlord class, and were also subjected to the Hu bandits' forced conscription. Therefore, after the three investigations and grievance tellings, their class consciousness was greatly improved, which led to their resolute and tenacious fighting style. At the same time, the platoon's excellent style also has its historical tradition. The platoon's former leader, now the platoon leader and combat hero Li Zhenliang, and the deceased platoon leader and combat hero Liu Dayan, were both brave, tenacious, and responsible models. Zhou Heizi and other soldiers of the platoon were cultivated in this excellent style. Now, they not only maintain but also develop this style, closely combining it with mobile and flexible tactics. Once, the company's test team tested assault movements. Zhou Heizi commanded a group, carefully observed the terrain and bunkers, and adopted mobile and flexible roundabout small encirclement tactics, moving within 30 meters of the enemy, launching a charge, bravely rushing up, smoothly capturing the bunker, and eliminating the enemy. The people who watched unanimously believed that this group's movements were the best, and the Zhou Heizi group won the tactical excellence flag. During a combat mobilization in the battalion where Zhou Heizi was located, a soldier said: "If the enemy comes, we will fight to the death." The platoon leader told him: "Fighting doesn't necessarily mean death. Look at the Zhou Heizi Platoon, using small encirclement tactics, without a single casualty, and achieving such a great victory!" They then practiced small encirclement tactics and learned from the Zhou Heizi Platoon. The regiment headquarters led this situation and launched a movement to learn from the Zhou Heizi Platoon. This movement has played a great role, not only promoting the tactical learning of the troops but also guiding everyone to learn the class qualities, fighting will, and style of the Zhou Heizi Platoon. Some backward soldiers have been positively influenced and become active. The leaders not only praised the advantages of the Zhou Heizi Platoon but also criticized their shortcomings, paying attention to cultivating them to make greater progress and strive for greater victories.

　　周黑子班战志顽强战术灵活
  　西北某部开展运动向他们学习
    【新华社西北一日电】西北人民解放军某部最近开展了一个“周黑子班运动”。战志顽强、战术灵活是周黑子班的特点。该班在今春＠县战斗中，以全班顽强的战斗意志，机动灵活的战斗动作，解决了守城敌人的最高指挥部，生俘少将专员兼保安司令乔维森以下二百五十余人，缴迫击炮二门，轻重机枪三挺，电台两部，电话机一架，敌币三千万元。全班九人无一伤亡，创立了以少胜多的光辉范例。支队庆功会上，被选为“战斗英雄班”。
    在＠县城墙被我军突破后，敌人撤退到该城的制高点——西南山上。敌最高指挥部在这里拼命地迫使士兵作无望的顽抗，企图凭着山上的工事，重新组织火力。五连（周黑子班所在连）看破了敌人的企图，就不顾一切地、主动地向山上的敌人展开猛烈的进攻。
    周黑子班积极向连上请战，主动出击增援友邻。当他们发现一排在正面被挡住时，马上就从正面撤退，迂回到敌人第一个院子的左上方，向敌人开了火。敌人受到了上下两面火力的杀伤，不得不退到窑里。该班乃以小包围将三个院子的敌人分割歼灭。当他们从山下向上运动时，山上和城墙上的敌人的交叉火力，封锁了进攻道路。他们即互相掩护，交替前进；并配合喊话，动摇敌人，终于最后消灭了全部敌人。
    周黑子班这种模范事迹，是和他们的阶级意识分不开的。周黑子是冀中雄县人，二十岁，出身贫苦家庭，一九四五年自动参军，去冬参加中国共产党。该班的副班长雷兴顺，战士郝克、刘海云等，都是揽工、放羊出身，受尽了地主阶级的压迫剥削，也受过胡匪的抓丁逼迫，故经过三查诉苦后，阶级觉悟即大为提高，从而产生了他们坚决顽强的战斗作风。同时，该班的这种优良作风，也有其历史的传统。该班前任班长现任该排排长战斗英雄李振良，和已故班长战斗英雄刘大雁，都是勇猛顽强、积极负责的模范。周黑子和该班的其他战士，就是在这种优良作风中培养起来的。现在，他们不仅保持而且发挥了这种作风，使之和机动灵活的战术密切结合起来。一次，连里测验小组攻坚动作，周黑子指挥一个组，仔细地观察好了地形和碉堡，即采用了机动灵活的迂回小包围战术，运动到距敌三十米内，发起冲锋，勇猛地冲上去，顺利地夺取了碉堡，消灭了敌人。参观的人，一致认为这个小组动作最好，周黑子组荣获了战术优胜旗。周黑子所在的营，在一次战斗动员时有个战士说：“敌人要来，死也要打。”班长就告诉他：“打仗不一定会死，你看人家周黑子班，用小包围战术，没有一个伤亡，胜利到那么大！”他们由此就演习小包围战术，向周黑子班学习。团部就根据这个情况加以领导，开展了学习周黑子班的运动。这个运动已起了很大作用，不仅推动了部队的战术学习，而且引导大家学习周黑子班的阶级品质、战斗意志和作风。一些落后战士已受其影响积极起来。领导同志对周黑子班不仅表扬他们的优点，同时也批评他们的缺点，注意培养他们更加进步，争取更大的胜利。
