The entire Longhai Railway traversing Henan Province, except for a small section west of Wenxiang, has been liberated.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 15th: To coordinate with the Huaihai Front offensive, the People's Liberation Army recovered the county towns of Shangcheng and Gushi in Henan Province on the 9th in the Dabie Mountain area, eliminating more than 300 enemy troops.

The other three are: Jinjiazhai (Lihuang), Zhuwumiao (Yuexi), and Xinji (Jingfu).
    Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 15th: The great victory of the People's Liberation Army's Autumn Offensive, especially the liberation of Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, greatly inspired the people of western Henan. Businessmen in Luoyang are actively planning to expand their businesses. The Sanxing Foundry in the city is preparing to go to Zhengzhou to purchase equipment. In Yu County, due to the liberation of Zhengzhou and Bian, the supply of goods is smooth, and prices are generally falling. Pork has fallen from 90 Central Plains currency per catty to 40 yuan. Salt, which used to cost 200 Central Plains currency for 5.4 catties, can now be bought for 9 catties. The prices of other imported goods, such as western medicine, have also fallen. In the midst of victory, many intellectuals are requesting to participate in work or study. Local bandits and hidden enemy and puppet personnel are voluntarily registering with the democratic government to repent and start anew. In Yu County, 136 members of the puppet organization registered on October 29th alone. Ji Jingyu, a prisoner in the county's Public Security Bureau, also confessed that he was an intelligence agent sent by the Zhengzhou puppet Public Security Bureau.
