Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. A compilation of reports indicates that after the collapse of the Kuomintang government's "price limit" policy, prices have generally soared in various regions, with an unprecedented rate of increase. According to an Associated Press report on the 4th, department store prices in Shanghai have tripled, the hotel industry has doubled, milk has increased four and a half times, bread has increased four times, the slaughtering industry has increased seven times, and grain prices have increased by 480%. A Reuters dispatch on the 2nd reported that prices of various commodities have increased five to fifteen times compared to when the price limits were abolished. The Kuomintang government had forcibly and gradually lowered market interest rates to around 5% after the "currency reform," but today they have jumped to 75%, an increase of fourteen times. Rice, which was equivalent to 21 yuan in counterfeit gold yuan before the "currency reform," has now jumped to 80 yuan per shi (Central News Agency, 1st). Prices in Tianjin have also soared. Taking grain prices as an example, flour currently costs 77 yuan per bag in counterfeit gold yuan, while the "price limit" was only 10 yuan. Rice currently costs 160 yuan per 100 jin, while before the "currency reform" it was only 20 yuan, an increase of seven times. Public utilities and transportation services under the Kuomintang government's control are also increasing prices in accordance with the "price adjustment" methods stipulated in the "supplementary measures." Passenger and freight transport on riverboats has increased fourfold since the 4th, and railway transport has also increased. These increases in public utility prices will further stimulate commodity price increases. An Associated Press report stated: "The collapse of the gold yuan has plunged the economy and industry of Kuomintang China into a swamp worse than the old legal currency era." "The economic situation is deteriorating hourly."

　　国民党“限价”政策失败后
  　蒋区物价空前猛涨
    一跳而上五倍到十五倍
    【新华社陕北八日电】综合各方消息：国民党政府“限价”政策破产后各地物价普遍飞涨，涨势之猛为前所未见。据美联社四日报导：上海百货涨价三倍，旅馆业涨价二倍，牛乳涨价四倍半，面包涨价四倍，屠宰业涨价七倍，米粮涨价百分之四百八十。路透社二日电报导：各植物价较废除限价时已涨达五倍到十五倍。国民党政府在“币改”后曾将市场利息强力逐渐压低至五分左近，今日复一跳而为七十五分，涨达十四倍。米在“币改”前每石折合伪金圆券为二十一元，如今跳涨至每石八十元（中央社一日电）。天津物价亦告猛涨，以粮价为例，目前面粉每袋为伪金圆券七十七元，“限价”仅为十元。稻米目前价格为一百六十元一百斤，而“币改”前仅为二十元，即皆涨达七倍。国民党政府管辖下的公用及交通事业亦在根据“补充办法”所规定的“调整价格”办法加价。江轮客货运已于四日起加价四倍，铁路运输亦已加价。这些公用事业的加价将更加刺激商品价格的上涨。美联社消息称：“金圆的崩溃已将国民党中国的经济和实业投入比旧法币时期还坏的沼泽中。”“经济情况正逐小时恶化。”
