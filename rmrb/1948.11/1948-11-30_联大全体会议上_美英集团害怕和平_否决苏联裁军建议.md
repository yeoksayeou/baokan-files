　　At the UN General Assembly
  　The US-British Bloc Fears Peace
  　Rejects Soviet Disarmament Proposal
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th] TASS, Paris: The UN General Assembly concluded its nearly two-month discussion of the Soviet proposal on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons on the afternoon of the 19th. The US-British bloc and its controlled "majority" rejected the Soviet proposal and passed the "Belgian proposal bearing the golden seal of the United States." Prior to the vote, representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia spoke in succession, detailing how empty and absurd the reasons for the US-British bloc's opposition to the Soviet proposal were, and exposing the aggressive policies of the US-British bloc. The audience in the packed gallery listened enthusiastically to the speeches of the representatives of the aforementioned countries. However, the representatives of the US-British bloc did not say a word in the General Assembly. As usual, when they could find no reason to defend themselves, they relied on their notorious "voting machine" to pass the Belgian proposal rejecting disarmament. However, this proposal is worthless in the eyes of world opinion, while the Soviet proposal, which has won the support of a real majority—peace-loving nations—has played and will continue to play a role in uniting the forces of the people fighting for peace.

　　联大全体会议上
  　美英集团害怕和平
  　否决苏联裁军建议
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：联大全体会议于十九日下午结束了近两个月来对苏联所提裁军与禁止原子武器建议的讨论。美英集团及其所控制的“多数”，否决了苏联的建议，并通过了“盖着美国金印的比利时提案”。表决以前，苏联、波兰、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、捷克和南斯拉夫的代表曾相继发言，详细地证明美英集团反对苏联建议的理由是如何的空洞与无聊，揭露了美英集团的侵略政策。座无虚席的旁听席上的听众，热烈地听着上述国家代表的发言。但美英集团的代表在大会中却一句话也没有说。和通常情形一样，它们在找不到理由辩护时，就依赖它们臭名远扬的“投票机器”，通过了拒绝裁军的比利时提案。但这个提案在世界舆论眼中是没有价值的，而博得真正大多数——各爱好和平民族的支持的苏联建议，则曾经而且将继续起着团结为和平而斗争的人民力量的作用。
