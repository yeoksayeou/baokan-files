Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. TASS reports: The USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), based on Stalin's suggestion, issued on October 24 a decision of particularly important significance for the further development of socialist agriculture – "On the Plan for Creating Forest Shelterbelts, Implementing Crop and Grass Rotation Systems, and Constructing Ponds and Reservoirs to Guarantee Annual Good Harvests in the Steppe and Forest-Steppe Zones of the European Part of the USSR."

The steppe and forest-steppe zones of the European part of the USSR are vast in area, with fertile soil, and have always been the largest agricultural area in the country, the most important granary of the Soviet Union. However, periodic droughts and hot winds from the Central Asian desert areas often cause severe disasters to agriculture. For hundreds of years, scientists have been studying ways to conquer drought. Although outstanding Russian scientists have created a farming system that can resist natural disasters, drought could not be conquered under the old system of landlords and capitalists, under the conditions of small-scale, individual farming. In the past, agriculture in this area suffered inestimable losses every two or three years. Now, the ever-increasing economic power of the Soviet socialist state and the vitality of the collective farm system have, for the first time in history, created decisive conditions for transforming nature, conquering drought, and striving for annual good harvests.

The above-mentioned decision passed by the USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) formulates a plan to lead this area to a complete and final victory over drought. The decision stipulates that all state farms and collective farms in this area (collective farms alone number 80,000), starting in 1949, must systematically and on a large scale implement the farming system based on the theories of outstanding Russian scientists Dokuchaev, Kostychev, and Williams – "crop and grass rotation system." The content of this farming system includes the following: planting protective forests on both sides of the watershed, around the farmland designated for planting various crops, around the farmland where crop and grass rotation is implemented, on the slopes of gullies and valleys, on riverbanks and lake shores, and around ponds and reservoirs; afforestation on sandy land; appropriately organizing farmland, implementing methods of crop and grass rotation and rational land use, appropriately cultivating the soil and planting crops, and appropriately using organic and mineral fertilizers; sowing selected seeds suitable for local conditions and with high yields; and constructing ponds and reservoirs based on local water sources to develop irrigation. The combination of the above methods will be a reliable weapon for conquering drought and improving agriculture, which can protect crops and soil, prevent the invasion of hot winds, improve water regulation and climate conditions, increase soil fertility, improve agricultural labor productivity, ensure greater harvests every year, and provide sufficient feed for animal husbandry.

In order to complete the above task of preventing hot wind invasion, the decision stipulates an unprecedentedly huge plan in agricultural history. The plan stipulates that within fifteen years, eight major state-owned forest shelterbelts will be created, including six parallel ones along both banks of the Ural River, and one each along the Volga River and the Don River. Each is 60 meters to 100 meters wide and more than 900 kilometers to more than 1,000 kilometers long. If all the state-owned forest shelterbelts are connected end to end, they will be 18,000 kilometers long (that is, 36,000 li), with a total area of 117,900 hectares. At the same time, according to the particularly large plan for planting protective forests around the fields of collective farms and state farms, the total area of protective forests to be planted within fifteen years will reach 5,700,900 hectares (approximately 91.314 million mu, more than half of the total cultivated land area of the North China Liberated Area). The decision also stipulates that from 1949 to 1955, during the seven years, collective farms in this area will build 41,300 reservoirs, and state farms will build nearly 3,000 reservoirs, in order to develop good irrigation.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. TASS news: The plan promulgated by the USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to conquer drought and strive for annual good harvests in the steppe and forest-steppe zones of the European part of the USSR has now begun to be implemented. The Soviet government has allocated huge amounts of money and instructed the Ministry of Timber Industry to be responsible for creating large-scale forest protection networks, establishing 570 "forest protection network manufacturing stations", equipped with a large number of tractors, graders, bulldozers, excavators and tree planting machinery, to carry out mechanized afforestation and construction of reservoirs. In addition to the existing network of nurseries, new nurseries are now being established on the best land to supply seedlings. Sixty new nurseries will be established in the next two years. Various trees will be planted according to different climates in different regions. The government will also train afforestation experts in large numbers according to the plan.

    苏联部长会议及联共中央决定
    征服旱灾争取年年丰收
    创建森林防护带·实行农作物与牧草轮种
    【新华社陕北三十日电】塔斯社报导：苏联部长会议及联共中央根据斯大林的建议，于十月二十四日颁发一项对社会主义农业进一步发展有特别重要意义的决定——“关于创建森林防护带、实行农作物与牧草轮种制、建造池塘与蓄水池，保证苏联欧洲部分草原与森林草原地带年年丰收的计划”。
    苏联欧洲部分草原与森林草原地带幅员广阔，土壤肥沃，向来是全国最大的农业区，是苏联最重要的谷仓。但周期性的干旱与来自中亚细亚沙漠地带的热风的袭击，常使农业遭受严重的灾害。几百年以来，科学家们一直在研究征服旱灾的办法。虽然优秀的俄罗斯科学家们创造了一种可以抵抗天灾的耕作制，但在地主资本家的旧制度下，在小规模的、个体耕作的条件下，旱灾是无法征服的。过去每隔两三年，这一地带的农业就要遭受一次难以估计的损失。现在，苏维埃社会主义国家日益增长的经济威力、和集体农场制度的生命力，在历史上第一次创造了改造自然，征服旱灾、争取年年丰收的决定性的条件。
    苏联部长会议及联共中央所通过的上项决定，制订出使这一地带走向完全地与最后地战胜旱灾的计划。决定中规定：这一地带的一切国家农场与集场农场（仅集体农场即达八万个），从一九四九年开始，必须有系统地与大规模地，实行以卓越的俄罗斯科学家多库查耶夫、科斯蒂捷夫及威廉士的学说为基础的农作制——“农作物与牧草轮种制”。这种农作制的内容包括下列各项：在分水岭的两侧，在划定种植各种不同作物的农田周围，在实行农作物与牧草轮种的农田周围，在沟壑和山谷的斜坡上，在河岸与湖岸上，在池塘与蓄水池的周围，植造防护森林；在沙地上造林；适当地组织农田，实行农作物与牧草轮种及合理地利用土地的方法、适当地耕耘土壤及栽种农作物的方法、及适当地使用有机肥料和矿物肥料的方法；播种适合于当地条件的、而且产量高的选种；以各地水源为基础，建造池塘和蓄水池，发展灌溉。上述各种方法结合在一起，将是征服旱灾、改进农业的可靠武器，可以保护农作物和土壤，防止热风的侵袭，改善水量的调节和气候情况，增加土壤肥沃的程度，可以提高农业劳动生产率，保证年年的更大的丰收，并为畜牧提供充足的饲料。
    为了完成上述防止热风侵袭的任务，决定中规定了一个在农业史上空前巨大的计划。该计划规定在十五年内创建八条主要的国有森林防护带，包括沿乌拉尔河两岸的平行的六条，沿伏尔加河、顿河的各一条。每条宽六十公尺至一百公尺，长九百余公里至一千余公里。如将所有的国有森林防护带首尾连接起来，共长一万八千公里（即三万六千华里），总面积将达十一万七千九百公顷。同时，按照在集体农场与国家农场田地周围植造防护森林特别庞大的计划，要在十五年内植造的防护森林，总面积将达五百七十万零九千公顷（约合九千一百三十余万市亩，大于华北解放区全部耕地面积的一半）。决定中又规定：一九四九到一九五五年的七年间，这一地带的集体农场要建造四万一千三百个蓄水池，国家农场要建造将近三千个蓄水池，以便发展良好的灌溉。
    【新华社陕北三十日电】塔斯社讯：苏联部长会议及联共中央所颁布的在苏联欧洲部分草原与森林草原地带征服旱灾、争取年年丰收的计划，现已开始实施。苏联政府已拨出巨款，并指令木材工业部负责创建大规模的森林防护网，设立五百七十个“森林防护网制造站”，备有大量拖拉机、平地机、开路机、挖掘机及植树的机械，进行机械化的造林及建造蓄水池的工作。除现有的苗圃网之外，现已开始在最好的土地上设立新苗圃，供应树苗。今后两年内将建立新苗圃六十处。根据各地不同的气候，将种植各种不同的树木。政府并将按照计划大批训练造林专家。
