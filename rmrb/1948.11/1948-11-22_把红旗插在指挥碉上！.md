Plant the Red Flag on the Command Bunker!
Peng Fei

October 16th, at dusk, after victoriously smashing three major enemy counterattacks, a general offensive was launched against the enemy's command bunker and bunker number two. As the sun was setting, the commander picked up the telephone and simply said two words: "Begin." At every artillery position, the artillery, aiming at the pre-sighted targets, fired all types of cannons with various ranges simultaneously. Heavy and light machine guns and small cannons sealed off the enemy's gun emplacements. The assault team, wearing helmets, advanced rapidly along the route determined after repeated reconnaissance and study. As soon as they reached the enemy's front line, they launched a fierce barrage of hand grenades, followed by explosions of dynamite along the outer and inner edges of the moat. Seventeen-year-old young soldier Zhang Xiwen threw a basket of hand grenades in one go during the assault. Yang Liankui led the assault team, using hand grenades to clear the way, routing the enemy everywhere. Liu Duhai was wounded in the head, went to the rear to have the medic bandage it, and hurriedly carried two more boxes of hand grenades up. Explosives expert Guo Liangchen, after carrying out the first blasting of the bunker, Wang Baoquan and other explosives experts rushed up one after another, once, twice, three times. The bunker painstakingly built by Yan’s bandits was battered and scarred, looking like a leper covered in syphilitic sores. At first it was standing, but now it has been blasted down by explosives. The Shizuizi stronghold and many bunkers have been occupied and destroyed by us. Now we are standing on the Shizuizi hilltop, and we can clearly see the city of Taiyuan. (Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Frontline)

I. Request to Fight in the First Echelon

After the Party entrusted the glorious task of capturing Shizuizi to the 172nd Regiment, all the comrades of the 2nd Company of that regiment immediately requested to fight in the first echelon. After the 1st and 2nd Companies captured bunkers number three and four at Shizuizi, they almost went crazy, repeatedly requesting the battalion commander to immediately respond to their request. Later, the battalion commander agreed and decided that they would attack the command bunker.

The attack began. Mountain guns, heavy cannons, and mortars bloomed continuously on the enemy's positions. The brave soldiers, under the cover of artillery fire, rushed to the front line. The two arrowheads of the assault team pierced straight into the enemy's heart. Seven enemies were still dreaming, and even when they called for their squad leader, assault team member Lei Yigui was already standing in front of the enemy, raising a hand grenade and shouting: "Don't move! Surrender your weapons!" The enemies obediently knelt down and surrendered their weapons. Lei Yigui explained casually, "I am from the Tenth Column, just liberated in the Jinzhong Campaign. The Eighth Route Army is lenient, don't be afraid!" Then he turned and went forward.

Grenade thrower Shen Miao discovered the enemy was pulling a mine fuse along the [moat/ditch]. He ran over and grabbed the mine rope at all costs. The enemy was pulling desperately inside the bunker, and he was pulling desperately on the ground, finally cutting the mine rope and protecting the safe advance of the assault team. They fought as they advanced, and the battle was completely resolved in just one hour. At this time, the sun had already risen from the east, and they climbed on the bunker and happily sang songs.

II. Losing the Position

Two o'clock later, the enemy launched another desperate counterattack, but because they were not well prepared, they painfully withdrew from the position. But just at this time, the regimental committee sent the red flag awarded to them to the company headquarters, telling them to plant the red flag on the bunker, but they lost the bunker. At this time, they were both excited and angry, and one by one they couldn't even speak. At this time, the 1st Company's red flag was victoriously planted, and the 3rd Company's red flag was also victoriously planted, but they were the only ones who couldn't plant it, which was such a disgrace! Even if they planted the red flag, it would not be glorious because they had lost the position again! So they simply put the red flag away. Soon, someone insisted on planting the red flag at the door, and clerk Wang Jinlan angrily pulled the red flag down again and immediately rolled it up.

III. To Plant the Red Flag on the Command Bunker

"We must retake the position and plant the red flag on the command bunker!"

This was everyone's unanimous slogan, but they became worried, fearing that the battalion would not believe in them, and would assign the task to another company. In this way, their red flag would never be planted. In addition, their personnel were fewer than other companies, and they became more and more worried. It was not until the superior gave them the task of retaking the position that they were relieved.

"One person must be worth several people!" They were extremely happy after accepting the mission. But with so few people and such a heavy task, how could they complete it? Everyone held a "Zhuge Liang meeting," everyone came up with ideas and ways, and everyone unanimously said: Grenade throwing team, blasting team, ladder setting team, everyone should bring a tool, every two people should bring a rifle, and after completing the task, they should also become an assault team as needed. There were six people in the grenade throwing team, including four young soldiers. Everyone was worried that they would not be able to complete the task. The four young soldiers were very unhappy when they heard this and said, "Don't look down on us because we are young, we can be as good as adults." The rescue team, led by clerk Wang Jinlan, had the slogan: Wherever the assault team goes, they will follow. At this time, the whole company was boiling, whether it was the cook, the barber, the clerk, or the propaganda officer, they all became nervous, determined to resolutely retake the command bunker and plant the red flag on the bunker.

On the evening of the 17th, they gathered in a trench, waiting for the order to attack.

The attack began, our mortar shells, hand grenades, and explosions sounded everywhere, hitting the enemy's front line. It was simply impossible to distinguish between dust and smoke. The assault team members took advantage of the smoke and climbed up from the [breach/opening] destroyed by our mountain guns. Lei Yigui, who had been the first in the previous assault, jumped over the barbed wire and immediately developed towards the right flank. Another group also inserted through the left flank, and the two arrowheads clamped straight through. The quick-witted little devil Wang Desheng had already jumped over the barbed wire and crawled into the bunker, immediately carrying out a machine gun and a rifle. The four little devils of the grenade throwing team were afraid of throwing too close, so they climbed over the outer moat with the assault team and started throwing on the [edge/ditch]. After the ladder setting team and the blasting team completed their tasks, they also followed the assault team. At this time, the whole company became an assault team and a grenade throwing team, and everyone worked together to continue to rush forward. Lei Yigui moved in the front line. A comrade was wounded, and the small clerk Wang Jinlan had an unknown amount of energy at this time, carrying the wounded off the line in one breath, and then carrying a large box of hand grenades back. After twenty minutes of such tension, the battle was completely resolved. So the command bunker returned to their hands, and the red flag was planted.

　　把红旗插在指挥碉上！
    彭飞
    十月十六日黄昏，在胜利粉碎了敌人三次大的反扑以后，对敌人指挥碉与二号碉发动总攻了。太阳刚落山，指挥员拿起电话机只说了两个字：“开始”。在各个炮兵阵地上，炮兵向着早瞄准好了的目标，各种射程的大炮，一齐发射。重轻机枪和小炮封锁着敌人的枪眼，突击队戴着钢盔，顺着经过反复侦察研究而后确定了的路线飞速跃进，一到敌人前沿阵地，马上就一阵猛烈的手榴弹，接着炸药也在外壕外沿和内沿开了花火。十七岁的青年战士张喜文在突击中一股劲扔了一筐手榴弹，杨连奎带着突击队，用手榴弹开辟道路，到处击溃敌人。刘杜海头部负伤了，到后面叫卫生员绑了绑，赶紧又扛上两箱手榴弹上去了。爆破手郭良臣，对该碉实施第一次爆破后，王保全和其他爆破手一个接着一个，一次、两次、三次冲上去，阎匪苦心修筑起来的碉堡，被打得遍体鳞伤，好象满身生了梅毒的大麻子一样，起先是站起来的，现在被爆药炸的跌倒了。石咀子据点阵地和很多碉堡，都被我们占领和消灭了，现在我们站在石咀子山头上，清清楚楚地看见了太原城。（新华社太原前线电）
    一、请求打第一梯队
    党把攻占石咀子的光荣任务，交给一七二一部队后，该部二连全体同志，就马上请求打第一梯队，当一二连队打下石咀子三四号碉堡后，他们简直要发疯了，再三请求营首长立刻答复他们的要求，后来营首长允许了，决定他们打指挥碉。
    攻击开始了，山炮、重炮、迫击炮，接连着在敌人阵地上开了花，英勇的健儿们，在炮火掩护下扑上了前沿，突击队两只箭头直直的插入敌人的心脏，七个敌人还在作梦似的，连喊他们班长的时候，突击队员雷义贵已站在敌人面前，把手榴弹一举猛然叫道：“不要动！缴枪！”敌人驯顺的跪下来把枪缴了。雷义贵顺口解释道：“我是十总队的，晋中战役才解放过来，八路军是宽大的，你不要害怕！”随后他扭身向前去了。
    投弹组申苗则在＠沿发现了敌人正在拉雷，他飞跑过去，不顾一切的把雷绳抓住，敌人在碉堡里拼命的拉，他在地下拼命的拉，终于剪断了雷绳，掩护了突击队的安全前进。他们一面打，一面前进，仅一个钟头全部解决了战斗。这时太阳已从东方出来，他们登在碉堡上高兴地唱起歌来。
    二、把阵地丢了
    两点钟过去之后，敌人又来了一次绝命的反扑，但由于他们没有很好的准备，忍痛撤出了阵地。可是恰在这个时候，团委把奖给他们的红旗送到连部来了，叫他们把红旗插在碉堡上，他们把碉堡却丢掉了，这时他们又兴奋又生气，一个个连话也说不出来。这时，一连的红旗胜利的插起来了，三连也胜利的插起来了，唯独他们不能插，这是多么不光荣的事啊！就是把红旗插起来，因为他们把阵地又丢了，也不光荣啊！于是他们索性把红旗收拾起来。不久不知谁偏偏又把红旗插在门口，文书王金兰气愤愤的一把又把红旗拔掉，立刻卷放起来。
    三、要把红旗插在指挥碉上
    “我们要夺回阵地，把红旗插在指挥碉上！”
    这是大家一致的口号，但他们耽心起来了，心里恐怕营里不相信他们，以致把任务交给别的连队，这样他们的红旗就永远插不起来了，加上他们的人员比别的连队也少，他们越想越担心了。直到上级给了他们夺回阵地的任务后，他们才放心了。
    “一个人要顶几个人！”接受任务后他们高兴极了。但他们人数这样少，任务这样重，怎么完成啊？大家开起“诸葛亮会”来，大家出主意想办法，大家一致的这样说：投弹组、爆炸组、架梯组，不论那个人都带上工具一件，每两个人带上一支步枪，完成任务后，随时按需要还要变成突击队。投弹组六个人，其中就有四个年轻战士，大家都耽心他们完不成任务，四个人听说很不高兴的说：“别看我们小，可是能顶大人用。”以文书王金兰为首的救护组，他们的口号是：突击队到那里，他们就跟到那里。这时全连沸腾了，不论炊事员、理发员、文书、宣教员，一致的紧张起来，抱定一个决心，坚决夺回指挥碉，把红旗插在碉上。
    十七日黄昏，他们集中在一条交通壕里，等候着攻击的命令。
    冲锋开始了，我们的迫击炮弹、手榴弹、爆炸一片声响，打到敌人的前沿阵地上，简直分不清了那是尘土还是烟雾。突击队员们便乘着烟雾，从我们山炮摧毁的＠沿上爬了上去，上次突击第一名的雷义贵，跳过铁丝网去，即向右翼发展。另一个组也插过左翼，两个箭头直钳过去。眼明手快的小鬼王得胜，早已跳过铁丝网，钻到碉堡里，立刻扛出一挺机枪和一支步枪。投弹组的四个小鬼，怕投的近了，跟着突击组爬过外壕，在＠沿上投起来。架梯组、爆炸组完成任务后，也跟着突击队上来了。这时全连都变成了突击队和投弹组，大家更合成一股劲继续地向前冲去，雷义贵运动在最前线。一个同志负伤了，小个子的文书王金兰这时不知有多大劲头，一口气就把伤员背下火线，又背起一大箱手榴弹回来。这样紧张的过了二十分钟，全部解决了战斗。于是指挥碉又回到他们的手里，把红旗插上去了。
