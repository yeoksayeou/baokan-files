[Sui-Meng Frontline Electric Dispatch] After our army entered the Baotou area, all units were able to abide by the twelve points of attention for Mongolian areas promulgated by the Corps, ensuring that they did not casually visit Mongolian temples, nor did they intrude into Mongolian residences or yurts without permission, fully respecting all Mongolian customs and habits. After our army entered Baotou, the garrison headquarters immediately ordered the troops not to reside in Mongolian houses. Mongolian representatives were invited to participate in military control meetings. The chairman of the Baotou Municipal Temporary Public Security Maintenance Committee is Rong Songting, a Mongolian gentleman. Kang Wang of the Darat Banner Wangfu, recalling Fu's oppression of Mongolian compatriots, was so angry that his old illness relapsed and he was bedridden for a long time. He refused the order to retreat with Fu's troops. Zhao Guanying, our Baotou Garrison Commander, went to express his condolences on October 26th and sent the health department to treat him. After a few days, his condition improved. On the first of this month, Kang Wang specifically asked Yan Ruiguang, the banner's resident representative in Baotou, to go to the garrison headquarters to express his gratitude, expressing his willingness to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to overthrow Fu Zuoyi's bloody rule and liberate all of Suiyuan. At the coal mine of the Shimo Te Banner Mongols of Daqing Mountain, north of Sarachi City, there is a Mongolian armed mine protection team of more than 40 people. One day, the captain, Babanba (transliteration), asked the county democratic government for instructions on how to deal with them. Our democratic government agreed to allow them to continue to protect the mine with peace of mind. The Mongols are very grateful for our army's policy of respecting ethnic minorities. In Chasuqi, Sar County, the Bayan Batu Mongolian guerrilla队隊隊隊隊隊隊隊队队队队队队隊隊隊隊隊队队队队队队队队队, in less than half a month, it developed from dozens of people to more than five hundred.

[Sui-Meng Electric Dispatch] The Fu bandit army, trapped in the isolated city of Gui Sui, was panic-stricken under the shock of the victory of our various armies, and rushed to build fortifications day and night, and soldiers fled one after another. After our army swept across Sui West and occupied Baotou, Fu bandit forced citizens and students to dig moats around the city. Dong Qiwu, chairman of the puppet Suiyuan Provincial Government, also forced the villages within ten miles of the city to be completely destroyed. Now all the houses in the twenty households and Yuan Shuimo Village in the suburbs three to five miles away from the city have been demolished. Wealthy city dwellers are allowed to relocate. Poor residents were driven to Sai Bei, living in the wilderness. Adults and children cried and screamed, watching the beams, bricks, and tiles of their residences being removed to build fortifications. The morale of the people in Gui Sui city was shaken, and the streets were blocked. Zhengfeng and Suizhong Middle Schools have suspended classes, and most of the students have been forced to put on military uniforms. The puppet currency fell several times a day, and prices soared alarmingly. Millet rose from 300,000 yuan per catty of puppet currency to 1.6 million yuan. More than 10 million yuan could not buy a pack of cigarettes. All private rice shops were sealed by Fu bandit and used as military rations. In order to add to the construction of fortifications, the "self-defense special donations" levied on merchants and civilians have reached seven times. Larger shops are forcibly levied 50,000 silver dollars per household. Large foreign goods stores such as Deyixing and Dadecheng have closed their doors because they cannot bear the Fu bandit's extortion. The enemies defending the city, intimidated by the power of our army, have completely lost confidence in defending the city. The families of high-ranking officials have fled to Beiping and Tianjin one after another, and some officials have put on soldiers' clothes. Soldiers deserted to the People's Liberation Army one after another. Jin Hou and other soldiers of the enemy's "Vanguard Team" threw down their axes and surrendered to our army in Shancheng. Yang Qinghai, the squad leader of the cavalry company directly under the 21st Regiment of the Enemy First Division stationed at the station, fled on horseback while watering his horse. Zhang Guangyao, the secretary of the First Regiment of the Provisional Tenth Division who surrendered, said that 30 of the 43 men in the mortar platoon of the First Battalion of the regiment had run away. On the 5th of this month, four soldiers from the Seventh Company of the Third Battalion of the 21st Regiment of the Provisional Seventh Division (the main force defending the city) surrendered to one of our units with two light machine guns and one rifle.

    【绥蒙电】困守在归绥孤城的傅匪军，在我各路大军胜利的震撼下，惊惶万状，日夜赶修工事，士兵纷纷逃亡。在我军横扫绥西，占领包头后，傅匪即强迫市民、学生挖围城沟，伪绥远省政府主席董其武，并迫令城十里以内村庄一律平毁。现已将城郊三五里的二十家子与三里地的圆水磨村等民房全部拆光。有钱的城里人，允许迁居。穷苦的居民，则被赶至塞北，宿居野处。大人孩子啼哭喊叫，眼看着自己住处的房梁砖瓦被拆去构筑工事。归绥城内人心动荡，街道堵塞，正丰、绥中两中学已停课，大部的学生被迫穿上了军服。伪币一日数跌，物价惊人狂涨，小米由每斤伪币三十万元，涨到一百六十万元。一千多万元买不到一盒烟，所有私人米店被傅匪悉数查封，充做军粮。为加修工事，商民们被征的“自卫特捐”，已达七次，较大的商号每户强征白洋五万圆，象德义兴、大德成等大洋货店，因不堪傅匪的暴征，已关了门。守城的敌人慑于我军的威势，已完全丧失守城的信心，高级官员的眷属纷纷飞往北平、天津，有的官员换上了士兵的衣服。士兵纷纷投奔解放军。敌“先锋队”一连战士金候等，在山城时，掷下斧头，投向我军。驻车站敌一师二十一团直属骑兵连班长杨清海，在饮马时纵马逃跑。敌暂十师第一团投来的书记张光遥说，该团一营迫击炮排四十三人，已跑了三十人。本月五日，暂七师（敌守城主力）二十一团三营七连四个士兵，携轻机枪两挺，步枪一支，向我某部投诚。（房亚田、郭锋、张乃臣）
