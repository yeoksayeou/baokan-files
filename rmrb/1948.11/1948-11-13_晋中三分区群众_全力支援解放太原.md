Jinzhong Electric Dispatch: The masses in the Jinzhong Third Sub-district are fully supporting the war to liberate Taiyuan. The five counties of Yuci, Taigu, Pingyao, Qixian, and Jiexiu have successively sent over [number redacted] militiamen and laborers to the front lines to undertake tasks such as battlefield transportation and carrying the wounded. In addition, a large number of carts transport military grain, ammunition, and equipment to the battlefield. All social strata are contributing the maximum manpower and materials to strive for an early "attack on Taiyuan and capture of Yan Xishan alive," and are continuously transporting them to the front. Hundreds of stonemasons, carpenters, and blacksmiths went to the front to destroy Yan's fortifications alongside the People's Liberation Army and remove obstacles to advancement. Many students went to hospitals to care for the wounded. Inspired by the determination of "not returning home without taking Taiyuan" and the victories at the front, many heroic model deeds have emerged among the laborers sent to the front: Lü Zixin, a laborer from Qixian County, was rewarded for repeatedly going deep into the firing line with his partners to rescue the wounded during the battle to clear the outer strongholds; Ji Sanli, a laborer from Shuixiu Village in Taigu, bought lamp oil with 200 yuan from each member of a stretcher team to take care of the wounded while transporting supplies. A laborer from Beishahe Village, after witnessing the brave fighting of the People's Liberation Army soldiers, shed tears of emotion and said, "Even if I die, I will go and carry supplies." Some laborers let the wounded rest back-to-back with them, treating them like family. Those who stayed behind actively participated in logistical work. When the men in Xisongbi Village in Jiexiu were busy planting wheat, the women, led by Captain Shi Yueying, took the lead in transporting equipment to a certain place more than twenty li away, and the children organized themselves to carry water and collect firewood for the families of the laborers. To ensure supplies for the front, the masses in the entire sub-district rushed to grind new rice day and night and transport it to the front.

　　晋中三分区群众
  　全力支援解放太原
    【晋中电】晋中三分区群众全力支援解放太原的战争。榆次、太谷、平遥、祁县、介休五县先后开赴前线民兵民工数达×万余名。担任战地运输、担运伤员等任务。另有大批大车辗转于战地输运军粮弹药器材。各阶层为了争取早日“打进太原去，活捉阎锡山”贡献着最大的人力物力，源源运送前方。数百工石匠铁匠到前方与解放军并肩摧毁阎匪工事，扫除前进障碍。许多学生到医院看护伤员。开赴前方的民工在“打不下太原不回家”的决心和前线胜利的鼓舞下，涌现了不少的英雄模范事例：祁县民工吕自新，在扫除外围据点的战斗中，和他的伙伴们连续数次深入火线抢救伤员，受到奖励；太谷水秀村民工冀三理在抬运彩号途中，为招呼伤员便在一个担架队里每人拿钱二百元集伙买了灯油。北沙河村一个民工目睹解放军战士的勇敢战斗后，感动的落下泪说：“死了我也要去抬彩号”。有的民工与伤员背靠背让他们休息，亲如家人。留在后方的人们，则积极参加了后勤工作。介休西宋壁村当男人们种麦忙时，妇女们由队长史月英带头向往返二十余里的某地运送器材，儿童们组织起来给民工家属担水、拾柴。全分区群众为保证前方供给，日夜赶碾新米运往前方。
