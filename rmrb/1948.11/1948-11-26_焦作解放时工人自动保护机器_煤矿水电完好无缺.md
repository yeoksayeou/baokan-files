　　Workers Automatically Protected Machines During the Liberation of Jiaozuo
  　Coal Mines and Hydropower were Completely Intact
    [Our Newspaper] After the liberation of Jiaozuo, order was well-maintained, and the people were overjoyed, especially the workers in the city who were exemplary. When the enemy and puppets were fleeing in panic, the power plant workers spontaneously gathered and stipulated a unified slogan: "The machines are our rice bowls," "We must unite to protect the machines, protect the factories, and welcome the People's Liberation Army." Before the Kuomintang troops on the streets had completely left, they put up posters everywhere, and workers and citizens gathered to welcome the People's Liberation Army. After our army entered the city, familiar workers and citizens shook hands and talked endlessly with our military and political personnel. The enemy attempted to disintegrate the workers and escape, destroying the factories, but under the united protection of the workers, all power plants, machine rooms, railway bureaus, and water pipes were intact. The enemy dragged thirteen gun-making machines eastward, but they were intercepted by our army. More than 900 workers in the city have resumed work. Each worker was first given 5,000 yuan in Jizhong banknotes to solve their immediate living difficulties. Their morale is very high after resuming work. Unemployed workers are all clamoring to return to work. In the chaotic situation that night, although the motors stopped, the workers still stayed at their posts, preventing the enemy from sabotaging and closing the gates tightly. They were afraid that the well would flood the machines, so they quickly appointed special personnel to be responsible for guarding them. The lights were only off for one night and then the electricity was restored as usual. They closed the street power switches for fear that our army would accidentally touch the power grid, and only restored power after people were sent to cut the power grid. Under the guidance of our correct policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce, merchants and residents in the city cleaned up their storefronts, and the market quickly recovered. As of the 30th, 108 established merchants and 79 vendors had opened for business. All twelve restaurants outside the South Gate were open, and eight of the twelve coal factories had resumed operation, with the addition of nine that had not been open for a long time. The merchants excitedly said, "The railway will be open soon, and we can do business well." Many merchants are now going out to sell goods. Buses have been opened to Changzhi and Jincheng, and a train captured by us has reached Lifeng. As of November 3rd, our North China Bank branch had issued 5.12 million yuan in industrial and commercial loans, and various merchants had deposited more than 16 million yuan in the bank. We have vigorously supported the production of poor citizens, issuing 4.4 million yuan in agricultural loans. The city government has lent 4,500 jin of wheat seeds to the city's districts, calling for urgent planting of wheat fields. Schools in the city have also cleaned up their sites and reopened. The workers and citizens who have been liberated again are talking about the victory of the People's Liberation Army in groups of three or five on the streets. It is circulating that: "The Kuomintang is dark to the bottom, the Communist Party is clear and incomparable, support the Eighth Route Army, overthrow the central government." The masses deeply believe that Jiaozuo will always be the city of the people. Touched by our lenient policy and policy towards prisoners, as of the 3rd, 73 Kuomintang and puppet military and political personnel have registered themselves, expressing repentance and self-renewal. The puppet subordinates thanked our party's policy and automatically handed over weapons and public property. Our army protects their private property and family property, and the property of those who flee is entrusted to their relatives and neighbors for safekeeping. Many puppet personnel are returning, and some puppet subordinates are going to call them back. Currently, our military and political personnel, in addition to continuing to eliminate the remnants of the Chiang bandits and investigating public property, are carrying out the following three tasks: (1) Restore and develop industry and commerce. (2) Strengthen public security work, strive to disintegrate enemy and puppet personnel, establish revolutionary public security management work, call for registration, repentance, and self-renewal, hand over weapons and ammunition, and stabilize social peace. (3) Widely and deeply publicize victory, publicize policies, build a new Jiaozuo, and protect production. (Hong Quan, Zhang Hua, Zhou Bo)
    [Taihang Electric] The workers in the Lifeng mining area east of Jiaozuo love their factory. Before and after our takeover, they not only never stopped producing coal, but also actively repaired it in cooperation with the democratic government. The workers in the mining area have tried their best to protect their machines before and after liberation. Before the Chiang bandits fled, they attempted to dismantle and destroy the machines, but were unanimously opposed and blocked by the workers, and the conspiracy failed. Miner Zhang Mingfu recalled: "The machines are our lives. If the enemy wants to destroy them, we won't let them. If we don't let him, he can't do it!" Power plant workers Zhang Yushan, Liu Wenbin, etc., closed the machine room doors tightly and carefully guarded the machines, and not a single part was lost. When the People's Liberation Army arrived at the West Mine, they saw thirteen workers guarding the boiler, so production never stopped for a moment. The workers were extremely excited to see the People's Liberation Army. Miner Zhang Mingfu said: "If you hadn't come, I would have gone to find you, otherwise I would have starved to death. The Kuomintang dogs haven't paid wages for two months." After the Jiaozuo City Temporary Military Control Commission took over the Lifeng mining area, it immediately held a workers' congress to comfort the worker brothers. The workers handed over the public property of the mine one after another. Yang Tingjian and Li Baoyu, the workers who managed the wind lamps, saved thirty-one wind lamps and a kerosene when the enemy fled and hid them in their homes. They handed them all over when we took over and were immediately praised by the factory. Other workers also handed over various machine parts, etc. Many unemployed workers during the enemy occupation ran to register first, requesting to resume work and participate in production and construction.

　　焦作解放时工人自动保护机器
  　煤矿水电完好无缺
    【本报讯】焦作解放后，秩序井然，民心欢腾，市内工人尤为模范。在敌伪慌忙撤退时，发电厂工人自动集会，规定一致的口号：“机器就是我们的饭碗”，“我们要团结起来保护机器，保护工厂，欢迎解放军。”街上的国民党军还未走完，他们便四出张贴标语，工人市民集队欢迎人民解放军，当我军入城后，熟习的工人市民与我军政人员握手言欢，畅谈不已。敌人企图瓦解工人逃走，破坏工厂，但在工人团结一心的保护下，所有的发电厂、机器房、铁路局、自来水管完好无损，敌将十三部造枪机器拉往东走，被我军截回，全市已有九百多工人复工，每个工人先借给五千元冀钞，解决眼下生活困难，复工后情绪十分高涨。失业工人都纷纷要求复工。在当晚的混乱的情况下，电机虽停顿，而工人仍各守职位，预防敌人破坏，紧闭大门。他们恐怕井淹机器，很快指定专人负责看守。电灯只熄灭一宿，即照常送电。他们因恐我军误触电网，将街上电门关闭，直至派人剪断电网才送电。市内商民，在我正确的保护发展工商业政策指导下，打扫门面，市场很快就已恢复。截至三十日，已有座商一百零八家、摊贩七十九家开门营业，南门外十二家饭铺全部开门，十二家煤厂恢复了八家，另增加好久未开业的九家，商人们兴奋的说：“铁路很快就会通车，这下可能好好做买卖了。”现已有不少商人出外贩卖货物。公共汽车已通往长治、晋城，我缴获的火车一列，已通至李封。我华北银行支行，截至十一月三日止，已发放工商业贷款五百一十二万元，各商号存款于银行有一千六百余万元。我大力扶助贫苦市民生产，已发放出农业贷款四百四十万元，市府已借给市内区麦种四千五百斤，号召赶种麦田。市内各学校也打扫校址，开学复课。再度解放的工人市民，在街上三五成群谈论着解放军的胜利。流传着：“国民党黑暗透了底，共产党清亮无法比，兴八路，倒中央。”群众都深信焦作永远是人民的城市。在我宽大政策与俘虏政策的感动下，蒋伪军政人员，截至三号止，已有七十三人自行登记，表示悔过自新。伪属人员对我党政策称谢不已，都自动交出武器公共资财，我军对其私人财产和家产，予以保护，对逃跑者的财产，则交其亲邻代管，许多伪方人员都正在返回，有的伪属前往叫回。现我军政人员除继续肃清蒋匪残余势力，清查公共资财外，正进行着下列三项工作：（一）恢复与发展工商业。（二）加强治安工作，争取瓦解敌伪人员，建立革命的治安管理工作，号召登记，悔过自新，交出武器军火，稳定社会安宁。（三）广泛的深入的宣传胜利，宣传政策，建设新焦作，保卫生产。（宏泉、张华、周波）
    【太行电】焦作以东的李封矿区的工人，热爱自己工厂，在我接管前后，不但一直没停止出煤，并协同民主政府积极修建。该矿区工人在解放前后，均极力保护自己的机器。蒋匪逃窜前，曾妄图拆卸破坏机器，但遭工人一致反对与阻挡，阴谋未逞。矿工张明富回忆说：“机器就是我们的命，敌人要破坏，我们就不让，不给他干，他也没法！”发电厂工人张玉山、刘文彬等，当紧张关头，他们紧闭机器房门不出，用心看守机器，大小零件一点也没丢损。当解放军一到西矿厂，就见十三个工人正看守锅炉，所以生产一刻也没停。工人看到了解放军，极为兴奋，矿工张明富说：“你们不打来，我就要找你们去，不然就得饿死。国民党狗日的两个月不给工资啦。”焦作市临时军管会接管李封矿区后，当即召开职工大会，慰问工人弟兄。工人们纷纷交出矿厂公物。管理风灯的工人杨廷拣、李保玉，当敌人逃窜时，他们将三十一个风灯，一部煤油保存到家里，我一接管，便全部交出，当即受到厂方表扬。其他工人亦纷纷交出各种机器零件等。敌占时的许多失业工人，均跑来争先登记，要求复工，参加生产建设。
