Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: Reports from various sources: The heroic general strike of French miners has entered its eighth week as of November 22nd. The French government's National Coal Mine Management Department recently admitted that due to the miners' persistent strike, France's coal production in October fell from an average monthly level of over four million tons to 500,800 tons, of which 340,000 tons were produced in the first three days of October before the strike began. In other words, only 168,000 tons of coal were produced in the first four weeks of the strike, equivalent to one day's normal production.

To express solidarity with and support for the striking French coal miner brothers, workers in the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary, the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries continue to raise and donate funds to them. Workers in the Asian part of the Soviet Union have already raised more than 26 million francs, and Bulgarian miners are setting aside special workdays, donating all wages earned on one day to French miners. In its appeal issued on the 18th, the Political Bureau of the Moroccan Communist Party guaranteed that "Moroccan soldiers will not fire on French workers."

After all attempts to suppress the strike failed, French Interior Minister and murderer Moch, on the 16th, shamelessly slandered the miners in the National Assembly, claiming that they were carrying out an "armed strike" and that "the government had uncovered weapons and explosives." In addition, he fabricated a monstrous lie, insisting that the donations sent by the working classes of various countries to the French miners were taken from the so-called "pockets of certain diplomatic circles" and handed over to the French Communist Party. French Communist Member of Parliament and miners' representative Lecoeur cited facts and eloquently proved that Moch's remarks were pure fabrication, and further revealed that the purpose of Moch's speech was "to find an excuse for the cabinet's radical legislation to curtail the right to strike and freedom to strike" (Agence Telegraphique). French Communist leader Duclos's powerful statement in the parliament finally shattered Moch's shameless lies. Duclos asked the government to establish two investigative committees, one to investigate the finances of the Communist Party and the other to investigate the finances of the Socialist Party's newspaper "Le Populaire". Duclos pointed out that it is well known that "Le Populaire" is funded by the British Labour Party, the social democratic parties of Belgium and Italy, and the American Federation of Labor. According to the legislation of April 1939, accepting foreign money for political propaganda is illegal in France.

　　法矿工罢工进入第八周
  　各国工人弟兄继续声援支持
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】各方报导：法国采矿工人的总罢工壮举，至本月二十二日已进入第八周。法政府国营煤矿管理部最近承认，由于矿工们的坚持罢工，法国十月份煤产量，由每月平均四百万吨以上水平，低落到了五十万零八千吨，其中有三十四万吨还是在十月份最初三天即罢工开始以前出产的。也就是说，在罢工最初四星期中，仅产煤十六万八千吨，相当于平时一天的产量。
    为声援和支持法国煤矿工人兄弟的罢工，苏、保、匈、美、英等国工人继续募集捐款汇赠他们。苏联亚洲部分工人已经募集了二千六百万法郎以上的捐款，保加利亚矿工们正划出特别工作日，将以一日所得工资全部汇赠法国矿工。摩洛哥共产党政治局在其十八日发表的呼吁中，保证“摩洛哥士兵不向法国工人开枪”。
    在一切镇压罢工企图失败之后，法内政部长杀人犯摩许十六日在国民议会上竟大肆诬蔑矿工们所实行的是“武装罢工”，说“政府曾破获武器及炸药”。此外，更捏造弥天大谎，硬说各国工人阶级汇寄法国矿工们的捐款，是从所谓“某些外交界口袋”里掏出来交给法国共产党的。法共议员矿工代表勒古尔列举事实，雄辩地证明摩许谈话纯系凭空捏造，并进而揭露摩许发言的目的，“是在给内阁提出的削减罢工权利和罢工自由的激烈立法寻找借口”（电通社）。法共领袖杜克洛在议会中的有力声明，最后地粉碎了摩许的无耻言。杜克洛要政府设立两个调查委员会，一个调查共产党的财政，另一个调查社会党机关报“人民报”的财政。杜克洛指出：人所共知，人民报受有英国工党、比利时与意大利的社会民主党及美国劳联的资助。按照一九三九年四月的立法，接受外国金钱以进行政治宣传在法国是犯法的。
