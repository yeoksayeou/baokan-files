Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 29th. In Yu-Xi (Western Henan) Songxian, Lushan and other places, the method of low-price contracted transportation has been initially implemented in the work of supporting the front, and has been successful. When the People's Liberation Army was besieging a certain place, the Dazhang and Deting districts of Songxian mobilized more than 700 civilian laborers in one day using this method, and rushed to deliver tens of thousands of catties of military grain through the night in the rain. Democratic government district cadres prepared boiled water and straw for the laborers along the way, and found houses for them, which further increased everyone's enthusiasm. Many laborers picked tung leaves to cover the public grain to prevent it from getting wet. All the grain-transporting laborers received a total of 12,000 catties of wheat in wages. Some said, "This time on a business trip, each person earned fourteen catties of wheat, so we can plant earlier this year!" Some said, "The People's Liberation Army really takes care of the supporting laborers. People have food to eat, cattle have food to eat, and they even give out grain when we come back. It's really incomparable to the Kuomintang bandit army, who use guns to beat and scold and grab people for corvee."

    豫西嵩县鲁山等地支前实行包运办法
    【新华社中原二十九日电】豫西嵩县、鲁山等地在支援前线工作中，初步实行低价包运办法，并且得到了成功。解放军围攻某地时，嵩县大章、德亭两区，用这种办法一天就动员了民工七百余，冒雨连夜赶送数万斤军粮。民主政府区干部一路替民工准备开水、草，找房子，大家情绪越发高涨。许多民工摘桐叶盖住公粮，以防淋湿。全部运粮民工，共得工资麦子一万二千斤。有的说：“这次出差，每人赚了十四斤麦子，今年可早下种啦！”有的说：“解放军真照顾支差老百姓，人有人吃的，牛有牛吃的，回来还发粮食，和国民党匪军拿枪打骂抓差真不能比。”
