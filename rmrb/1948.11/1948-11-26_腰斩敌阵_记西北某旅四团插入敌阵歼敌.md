　　Cutting the Enemy's Formation in Half
    ——A Record of the Fourth Regiment of a Certain Northwest Brigade Inserting into Enemy Lines and Annihilating the Enemy
    On the afternoon of October 5th, the Fourth Regiment of a certain brigade of the People's Liberation Army received the following operational order: "March at full speed, regardless of everything, and insert into the enemy's rear between Xiguan Village and Siqian Town in the defense zone of the enemy's 17th Division and 48th Brigade. Resolutely eliminate any enemies encountered along the way, and capture Zhangjiacheng and Yuanpan two villages before dawn on the 6th. Construct positions to sever the connection between the enemy's 17th Division and 12th Brigade and the 48th Brigade, to facilitate the annihilation of the 48th Brigade by fraternal units. Be prepared to cope with attacks from both sides after dawn."
    All the commanders and fighters of the regiment were very excited and happy when they received the order, because they had submitted letters of request to the higher authorities more than once. The soldiers immediately put on all their equipment and ran in the yard. The artillerymen also pulled mules loaded with cannons on the street, all to test for noise and find ways to avoid any noise.
    At dusk, the troops set off. After a forced march of thirty miles, they arrived at the enemy's defense line. Xiguan Village had a company of enemies, and Siqian Town had a regiment of enemies. The two villages were only five miles apart. Our army quickly and secretly inserted between the two villages after deploying sentries.
    After passing through the enemy's defense line, they entered the enemy's hinterland and traveled through the enemy's strongholds scattered across the great plain. Because the destination was still sixty miles away, the whole regiment traveled light, in single clothes, running forward. In the cold autumn night, everyone was covered in sweat. Late at night, tight gunshots and artillery fire came from tens of miles away, announcing the start of the fraternal units' attack. Everyone was even more excited and headed straight for Zhangjiacheng.
    At Ge＠Yaotou, only five miles away from Zhangjiacheng, more than a hundred enemy security police fled in panic without being attacked by our army. Ahead, the enemy's group bunkers fired blindly at our army. In order to quickly occupy Zhangjiacheng, the regiment decided to pass through the 300-meter gap between the bunkers and the village where the enemy's 48th Brigade headquarters, Nan Su Nao Village, was located, regardless of the enemy's strafing.
    However, the vanguard company had just passed through when the follow-up troops encountered the enemy.
    Deputy Chief of Staff Li saw a large dark mass of people dozens of meters away on the side of the road and asked them what unit they were from. The answer was the 48th Brigade's direct unit. Deputy Chief of Staff Li said, "We are on our own," while ordering them to spread out. All the gun muzzles were aimed at the enemy, and they shouted, "Those who lay down their arms will not be killed, and prisoners will be treated leniently!"
    "The 48th Brigade has never surrendered!" the enemy officer replied arrogantly. Immediately, like a rainstorm, all the machine guns swept towards the enemy. These bandits who claimed to have "never surrendered" did not dare to make a sound and surrendered obediently. "Surrender!" A soldier who rushed over kicked a fallen enemy and shouted this. "I am a corpse!" the terrified enemy cried out.
    The enemy was eliminated, and the regiment chased the remnants of the enemy while marching rapidly towards Zhangjiacheng. It turned out that this group of enemies that was eliminated was the 48th Brigade headquarters. When they received a report from the enemy in Xiguan Village that our army had penetrated deep, they attempted to flee west, but they were encountered and eliminated by our army as soon as they left the village. The enemy brigade commander Wan Youlin and his four guards only ran half a mile further before being captured. While advancing towards Zhangjiacheng, the regiment also encountered two enemy buglers who had been scattered, who said that they also had a platoon that had lost contact. Our army immediately ordered them to blow the bugle and bring this platoon of enemies to be prisoners as well.
    When they arrived at Zhangjiacheng, the enemy security team stationed in the village had already fled. At dawn, the first battalion of the regiment captured Yuanpan Village with only three casualties. At this point, the enemy's 48th Brigade was completely surrounded. At this time, fierce gunshots and artillery fire sounded from all the villages where the enemy's 48th Brigade was stationed, and our army launched a general attack on the brigade.
    After dawn, the enemies all around bombarded Zhangjiacheng and Yuanpan Village. Two enemy battalions counterattacked Zhangjiacheng from Weizhuang and Dajiayuan. When they approached our position, the soldiers of the fifth and sixth companies rushed out with shiny bayonets. The enemy abandoned their weapons and fled in embarrassment, and we took advantage of the victory to occupy Dajiayuan. The first battalion in Yuanpan Village also annihilated an enemy platoon and seized Xibaocheng Village in an attack.
    Thus, at 10:00 a.m., the enemy's 48th Brigade was completely annihilated.

　　腰斩敌阵
    ——记西北某旅四团插入敌阵歼敌
    十月五日下午，解放军某旅四团接到这样一道作战命令：“以急行军不顾一切地从敌十七师四十八旅防地西观村与寺前镇之间插入敌后，坚决消灭途中遇到的敌人，于六日拂晓前攻占张家城与塬畔两村，构筑阵地，割裂敌十七师十二旅与四十八旅的联系，以便利兄弟部队歼灭四十八旅。天明后要准备应付两面敌人的进攻。”
    全团指战员接到命令都非常兴奋、愉快，因为他们已不只一次向上级递过请战书。战士们立刻都把所有装备背起来在院内跑步，炮兵也拉着驮好炮的骡子在街上跑，都是为了试验有没有声响，和想办法避免一切声响。
    黄昏，部队出发了，经三十里的急行军，到达了敌人的防线。西观村有敌人一个连，寺前镇有敌人一个团，两村相距仅五里。我军于布置警戒后，即迅速而秘密地从两村间插过去。
    通过敌防线后，进到敌人的腹地，在大平原上密布的敌人据点间穿行。由于目的地还在六十里以外，全团轻装单衣，跑步前进。在寒冷的秋夜里，个个跑的浑身是汗。深夜，从背后数十里外传来了紧密的枪炮声，宣布兄弟部队攻击开始了。大家更加兴奋地直奔张家城。
    在圪＠窑头，距张家城只五里的地方，敌保警队百余，未经我军攻击，就仓皇逃窜了。前面，敌人的集团碉堡向我军盲目射击起来。该团为了迅速占领张家城，就决定不顾敌人的扫射，从碉堡与敌四十八旅旅部所在村南酥酪村之间三百公尺的空隙中行过去。
    但是，前卫连刚刚通过，后续部队与敌人遭遇了。
    李副参谋长见路侧数十米处，黑压压一大片人，问他们是哪一部分的，回答是四十八旅直属队。李副参谋长一面说：“自己人”，一面下令展开。一切枪口都对准了敌人，并高喊：“缴枪不杀，宽待俘虏！”
    “四十八旅从来没缴过枪！”敌军官傲慢地回答。马上，象暴风雨一样，所有的机枪向敌人扫过去，这群声称“从来没缴过枪”的匪徒们不敢出声，驯服地举起手来了。“缴枪！”一个冲过去的战士踢着一个躺下的敌人时这样喊着。“我是死尸！”吓昏了的敌人却这样叫出来了。
    敌人被解决了，该团一面追击残敌，一面向张家城急进。原来这一股被解决的敌人正是四十八旅旅部，当他们接到西观村敌人报告，知道我军深入后，即妄图向西逃窜，不想一出村就与我军遭遇而被解决。敌旅长万又麟和他的四个卫士也只多跑了半里路，就被俘获了。在向张家城前进中，该团又碰上了两个被打散的敌号兵，说他们还有一个排失掉了联络。我军当即命令他吹号，把这一排敌人也调来当了俘虏。
    到达张家城时，原驻该村的敌保安队早已逃窜了。拂晓，该团一营仅以三人的伤亡攻占了塬畔村。至此，敌四十八旅就完全被包围了。这时，所有敌四十八旅所驻的村庄都响起了激烈的枪炮声，我军已向该旅发起了总攻。
    天明后，四周的敌人都向张家城和塬畔村炮轰，敌人两个营自韦庄和党家塬向张家城反扑，在接近我阵地时，五连和六连的战士们就端着雪亮的刺刀冲出，敌人狼狈弃枪逃跑，我乘胜占领了党家塬。在塬畔村的一营，也于出击中歼敌一排，夺取了西堡城村。
    这样上午十时，敌四十八旅即被全部歼灭。
