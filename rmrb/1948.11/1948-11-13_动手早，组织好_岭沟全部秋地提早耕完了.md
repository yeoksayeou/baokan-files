　　Taiyue Electric: Linggou Natural Village in the Second District of Yicheng, with its 580 mu of autumn land, completed all plowing ahead of schedule on the 27th of last month. The reasons for this, in addition to the general conditions such as livestock, are primarily that the leadership was able to conduct in-depth propaganda and mobilize everyone to start autumn plowing early. At the beginning of the eighth lunar month, when harvesting began, the village chief mobilized everyone at a general meeting to plow as they harvested. He used examples of some farmers who had good harvests this year because they did a good job of autumn plowing last year, explaining the benefits of autumn plowing, and pointing out that our hillside area freezes early, and if we don't seize the time, we will miss the autumn plowing and harvest less grain. This raised everyone's vigilance, and they all planned and started early. Those with livestock plowed as they harvested, and those without livestock exchanged labor with households with cattle to plow the land as soon as possible. Secondly, they brought into play the role of being organized. Everyone rejected the previous forced mutual aid groups and reorganized six small-scale mutual aid groups based on the distance of each household's residence and each person's wishes, implementing free exchange of labor between people and animals, which solved the difficulties of some households with manpower and animal power in autumn plowing. All 35 livestock in the village found partners and combined into 15 teams, first plowing the land of their own group, and then going to other groups to plow. In terms of exchanging labor, a mutually beneficial principle was adopted to expand the scope of labor exchange. For example, the old man Liu Wenlin, who is over 70 years old, could not do heavy work, but he could weave baskets and other furniture, so he exchanged for labor and cattle labor, and plowed his four mu of autumn land. Both sides were happy. For the family members of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who had no livestock and no labor, the method of family members of soldiers finding suitable people to plow on their behalf was adopted, and the labor used was uniformly borne by the whole village. The difficulties of each family were solved, and the land was plowed early and well.

　　动手早，组织好
  　岭沟全部秋地提早耕完了
    【太岳电】翼城二区岭沟自然村，五百八十亩秋地，已于上月廿七日全部提早耕完。其原因，除了有牲口等一般条件外，首先是领导上能深入宣传，发动大家早早动手秋耕。阴历八月初头开始收割时，村长就在大会上动员大家随收随耕，并以某些农户因去年秋耕做得好，今年多打了粮食的实例，说明秋耕的好处，说明咱这山坡地方上冻早，不抓紧就会误了秋耕，少收粮食。这样提高了大家的警惕，都早早计划，早早动手。有牲口的一边割一边耕，没牲口的也趁早和有牛户变下工耕地。其次是发挥了组织起来的作用。大家否定了以前强迫命令的互助组，重新按各家住的远近，各人的心愿，组成了六个小型互助组，实行人畜自由变工，解决了秋耕中某些户的人畜力困难。全村三十五个牲口，自找对象结合成十五犋，先犁完本组的地，又到别组去耕。变工上，采取了双方有利的原则，扩大了变工范围。如刘文林老汉已七十多岁，不能做重活，但会编箩头等家具，就换下人工牛工，把四亩秋地也犁了，双方都高兴。对没牲口没劳力的军干烈属，采取了军属自找对劲的人代耕，所用工由全村统一负担，各家的困难都得到解决，地都早早犁完，还犁得好。
