　　Jizhong Agricultural and Forestry Department Convenes Meeting of Counties
　　Study of Afforestation of Sandy and Alkaline Land
　　[Jizhong News] The Jizhong Administrative Office's Department of Agriculture and Forestry convened afforestation meetings on October 18th at the Xinji Farm and the Yuntaishan Farm in Xian County respectively. Five counties, including Hejian and Xian County, participated in the Yuntaishan afforestation meeting, focusing on afforestation of alkaline land. Twelve counties, including Xinle and Ding County, participated in the Xinji afforestation meeting, focusing on afforestation of sandy land. In addition to 104 agricultural and forestry administrative cadres from the special districts and counties, as well as cadres from experimental farms, extension farms, the administrative office's afforestation team, and the extension team, nine experienced old farmers and Comrade Huang Shu from the Forestry Group of the North China Government's Ministry of Agriculture also participated. First, the tree planting situation in each county during the spring and rainy seasons of this year was reviewed, and the afforestation plans of each county for this autumn were discussed. Then, the old farmers reported their tree planting experiences, and Comrade Huang Shu introduced the afforestation experience of the North Yue District. The review of tree planting in the spring and rainy seasons revealed the following experiences:
　　Jizhong planted more than 3.09 million trees this spring. According to the results of random checks by the administrative office and inspections by the counties, the general survival rate is about 60%. Although these achievements have been made, some shortcomings and problems still exist.
　　1. From the perspective of the number of surviving trees: Wherever the government dispatched special personnel to be responsible for mobilizing the masses, with organization, planning, leadership, and attention to planting techniques and protection issues, the survival rate was higher. For example, for the tree planting on the Hutuo River embankment, the public provided tree seedlings and sent people to lead the planting. The trees planted in the spring had a survival rate of 80%, and those planted in the rainy season had a survival rate of 90%. In the sandy areas of Shulu, Jin County, and Ningjin, the average survival rate was 79%. Wherever there was no dedicated leadership, with the sole aim of planting as many trees as possible without regard for survival, and without attention to technology, organization, and management, the survival rate was lower. For example, in Anshen (Ze), Anding, and the western section of the Cangshi Highway, the trees were provided by the public and distributed to the villages for planting in sections, with a survival rate of less than 50%. In particular, the survival rate of children's afforestation was very low (such as in Sanjie, Shulu). Upon inspection, this was mainly due to the launch of competitions during planting, and the children, being playful, planted carelessly.
　　2. From the perspective of afforestation organization methods: There are mainly three types of organization methods: One is large-scale cooperative afforestation organized according to the masses' habits and demands, related to the masses' interests, and after full deliberation and discussion to formulate clear measures (shareholding dividends, tree trimming and tending). For example, the Chengtan Forest in Ding County's Ding Village and the windbreak forest in Duan Yangbei, Ningjin, had high survival rates, and were well cared for and repaired. Another type is the old tree association organization of the masses. Such as "Shaozhong," "Fenshou," "Kejiaban," and "Bozihui," which are small groups of several or dozens of households planting together. The organizational methods are very simple and clear. For example, in Ma Luoqi's Shaozhong tree planting in Dianhuying Village, Ningjin, those providing tree seedlings and labor (including technology) each accounted for one-quarter, and the land share accounted for two-quarters. The seventeen tree associations organized by Zheng Luoxi in Zhao Lanzhuang, Jin County, calculated land as half a share, and tree seedlings and labor together as half a share. The survival rate of the trees planted was generally above 80%. There is also a type of collective afforestation that was not fully prepared, but was temporarily promoted in response to the call of higher authorities. Such as the children's forests, women's forests, emancipation forests, and village-owned forests built in various places this spring. Not starting from the habits and demands of the masses, the measures are not clear, and the public and private interests are not well combined, resulting in a survival rate of less than half. For example, in Dong Changshou, Dong Ming Village in Xinle, and Jiangu Village in Gaocheng, the entire village mobilized to plant for two or three days this spring, with each village planting more than 3,000 trees. Now, upon inspection, almost all of them have died or been damaged.
　　3. From the perspective of planting techniques: Wherever the planting techniques of the local masses are relied upon, rather than subjectively transplanting the planting experience of other regions, the survival rate is generally very high. For example, in Xitian Village, Xinle, this spring, An Luohe and four other experienced tree planters from the village led the planting, and An Luohe taught everyone the planting methods, and organized a technical guidance group to be responsible for inspection and guidance at any time. Two thousand trees were planted, with a survival rate of 90%. Wherever the planting techniques of the local masses are not relied upon, but only subjectively transplanting the planting experience of other regions, the survival rate is generally not high. This spring, when planting elm trees on the Gaocheng section of the Cangshi Road, the masses suggested watering, but the cadres leading the tree planting said that watering would rot the roots and refused to accept it. As a result, almost all the trees planted without watering died from drought, and the few that were watered all survived.
　　4. From the perspective of tree protection: According to the inspection of 130 villages in six western counties, general forest protection covenants have been established, and various different tree protection methods have been adopted. There are mainly two methods: One is dedicated personnel for guarding, and the masses give the tree guards a certain remuneration, which is generally better protected. For example, Feng Peiran (a representative of the poor peasant group) in Tian Village, Shulu, was actively responsible for tree protection and persisted to the end. The village gave him two bags of sorghum, and he became even more active in tree protection afterwards. In Xiaociyi, Gaocheng, the masses voluntarily took out some grain to give to the tree guards as remuneration. Some villages nominally put forward two or three tree guards, but did not give the tree guards certain benefits, such as Sujiazhuang in Ningjin, resulting in poor tree protection. Another method is to formally establish forest protection covenants, with the entire village jointly guarding, but the result is that no one guards. For example, in Jiangu Village, Gaocheng, the trees planted in the spring, in addition to those that died from drought, were all damaged. The masses reflected: "Nominally, everyone is jointly guarding, but it is not their own business, and no one wants to offend others for nothing." Some, such as Qipu Village in Xinle, specifically assigned the village-owned forest to households by row, and each household freely formed tree-watching groups, with each group managing several rows, and the cut branches belonging to the tree watchers. As a result, the protection was very good. This proves that whether it is dedicated personnel guarding or the entire village jointly guarding, it must be combined with the interests of the tree guards to ensure good protection. If it is just a formality, the trees will not be well protected.
　　5. From the perspective of leadership: There were also some shortcomings in the leadership of tree planting in Jizhong this spring: First, insufficient preparation, and insufficient investigation and research on the sandy and barren land and afforestation situation in various places; insufficient understanding of the afforestation conditions in various places and the masses' requirements and habits for tree planting. Second, insufficient attention to the combination of public and private interests. Third, simple calls for tree planting, and insufficient attention to the protection of old trees. Fourth, excessively high demands for tree planting achievements, with attention only to the number of trees planted and little attention to the survival rate.

　　冀中农林厅召集各县开会
  　研究沙荒地碱地造林
    【冀中讯】冀中行署农林厅十月十八日在辛集农场和献县云台山农场分别召开造林会议，河间、献县等五县参加云台山造林会议，以碱地造林为主。新乐、定县等十二县参加辛集造林会议，以沙地造林为主。除到有专、县农林行政干部及试验场、推广场、行署造林队、推广队干部共一百零四人外，并有栽树有经验的老农九人和华北政府农业部林业组黄舒同志参加。先检查各县今年春季、雨季植树情况，并讨论了各县今秋造林计划，后由老农报告栽树经验，黄舒同志并介绍了北岳区造林经验。检查春、雨两季植树，有以下经验：
    冀中今春栽树三百零九万余棵，经行署派人抽查与各县检查结果，一般成活百分之六十左右。虽然得到了这些成绩，但仍存在着一些缺点和问题。
    一、从树木的成活数上看：凡是由政府派出专人，负责发动群众，有组织、有计划、有领导并注意栽树技术和保护问题的，活的就多。如滹沱河堤的植树，由公家出树秧，派人领着栽，春季栽的活了百分之八十，雨季栽的活了百分之九十。束鹿、晋县、宁晋沙荒地区，平均成活百分之七十九。凡是没有专人领导，光图轰轰烈烈栽的多，不管活不活，技术、组织、和管理都不注意的，活的就少。如安深（泽），安定和沧石公路西段，是由公家出来，按段分给村里栽的，成活的在百分之五十以下。特别是儿童造林，活的很少（如束鹿三街）。检查起来，主要由于栽的时候发动了竞赛，儿童们又好闹，栽的很马虎。
    二、从造林组织方式上看：组织方式主要有下面三种：一种是根据群众习惯和要求，关系到群众利益，经过充分酝酿讨论，订出明确办法（入股分红，修树看树），而组织起来栽的大型合作造林。如定县丁村成滩林、宁晋段羊杯防风林，活的既多，看管修理都很周到。再一种是群众旧有的树会组织。如“捎种”、“分收”、“客家班”和“播子会”等，是由几户或几十户结成小组伙着栽的。组织办法都很简单明确。如宁晋佃户营村马洛齐的捎种树，出树秧与出劳力（包括技术）的各占四分之一，地股占四分之二。晋县赵兰庄郑洛喜带头组织起来的十七个树会，地算一半股，树秧跟劳动力共算一半股。所栽的树成活一般都在百分之八十以上。还有一种是没有经过充分准备，光为了响应上级号召，一时鼓动起来的集体造林。如今年春季各地造的儿童林、妇女林、翻身林和村有林等。不从群众的习惯和要求出发，办法不明确，公私利益没有结合好，结果成活的都不到一半。如新乐的东长寿、东名村和藁城的坚固村，今春全村动员栽了两三天，每村都栽了三千多棵，现在一检查，差不多都死了或遭破坏掉了。
    三、从栽树技术上看：凡是依靠当地群众的栽树技术，而不是主观的搬运其他地区的栽树经验的，一般都活的很多。如新乐的西田村，今春由本村栽树有经验的安洛鹤等五人领着栽的，栽时由安洛鹤教给大家栽法，并组织了技术指导小组，负责检查，随时指导。栽了两千棵，活了百分之九十。凡是不依靠当地群众的栽树技术，而只是主观地搬运其他地区的栽树经验的，一般都活的不多。今春沧石路藁城段栽榆树时，群众提议要浇水，领导栽树的干部说浇水怕沤了根，不肯接受。结果没有浇水栽的差不多都干死了，其中有少数浇了水的就都活了。
    四、从树木的保护上看：根据西部六个县一百三十个村的检查，一般的都订立了护林公约，采用了各种不同的护树办法。主要的办法有两种：一种是专人看管，由群众给看树人一定的酬劳，一般都保护的比较好。如束鹿田村冯培然（贫民团的一个代表），对护树积极负责，坚持到底，由村里给了他两布袋高粱，以后他对护树就更积极。藁城的小慈邑也是由群众自愿的拿出一部分粮食给看树人作为报酬。有的村子，形式上推出了二、三个看树人，没有给看树人一定的利益，如宁晋苏家庄，结果树木都保护的不好。还有一种是形式上订了护林公约，由全村群众公看，结果是都不看。如藁城的坚固村，春天栽的树除干死的外，剩下来的都遭坏掉了。群众反映：“名目上是大家公看，不是自家的事，谁也不愿白得罪人。”有的，如新乐齐铺村，把村有林按行具体分配到户，各户自由结成看树小组，每组管几行，砍下来的树枝归看树人。结果就保护的很好。证明：不论是专人看管，或由全村公看，一定要跟看树人的利益结合起来，才保护的好。一走了形式，树木就保护不好了。
    五、从领导上看：冀中今春栽树，领导上也存在着一些缺点：第一是准备不足，对各地沙荒和造林的情况调查研究不够；对各地的造林条件和群众栽树的要求、习惯等了解的也不够。第二、对公私利益的结合注意的不够。第三、单纯的号召栽树，对旧有树木的保护注意不够。第四、对栽树的成绩要求过高，光注意了栽的数字，很少注意到成活的多少。
