　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 22nd. Changchun Special City is actively carrying out reconstruction work. After completing the initial water supply task, the waterworks is now inspecting the waterways and repairing the water source to ensure that the city's water use this winter is worry-free. The tram factory is actively rushing to repair the lines, reaching 30 trams in operation. The number of cars produced by the automobile factory is also constantly increasing. The telephone and telegraph bureaus continue to rush to repair lines in the north and south, and plan to install 1,700 telephones before the end of this month. After 83 hours of emergency repairs, employees of the city's power bureau safely supplied electricity to factories and institutions on the 24th of last month. Four substations, 76 additional line towers, two 3,300-volt main lines, 20 kilometers of distribution lines, and more than 9 kilometers of field lines have been repaired. This repair project was extremely difficult. Before the liberation, the power supply in the city was severely damaged by the Kuomintang bandits, and all tram lines were destroyed. Most of the city's thousands of transformers were damaged, and many electric poles in the suburbs were chopped down by bandits for firewood, and many electric wires were used as barbed wire for fortifications. The two 150,000-volt and 25,000-kilowatt transformers in the first substation were completely destroyed, and more than 240 barrels of transformer oil in the second substation were stolen and sold. In order to support the resumption of private factories, the municipal government has announced a three-month tax exemption and will issue a large amount of loans. The well-known hardware company Yi Xing He, which had been closed down for a long time by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, has resumed business. Other private enterprises are also opening one after another. Yaguang Light Bulb Factory, Shengbin Iron Factory, and others have all posted announcements recruiting workers.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd. New cultural activities have been vigorously launched in Shenyang. The city's Xinhua Broadcasting Station began broadcasting domestic and foreign news, government orders, proclamations, and various entertainment programs on the third day after liberation, three times a day, for a total of seven hours. The Shenyang branch of the Northeast Bookstore opened on the 8th and set up two retail departments. People flocked to buy books every day. The reading room set up by the bookstore has more than 500 kinds of books and magazines, and it is always full. More than 1,500 people come to read every day. The privately-owned Guanghua Bookstore will also officially open for business within days. All eleven cinemas in the city have been showing "Democratic Northeast" produced by the Northeast Film Studio since the 9th, and every show is full. The Lu Xun Art and Literature Troupe and the Yangko teams, lecture teams, and slogan teams organized by various schools have been conducting street propaganda for days, which is warmly welcomed by the citizens.
