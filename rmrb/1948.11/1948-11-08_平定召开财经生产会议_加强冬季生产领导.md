　　Píngdìng Convenes Financial and Production Conference
  　Strengthen Leadership in Winter Production
    [Píngdìng News] In order to strengthen leadership in winter production, the Píngdìng County Head personally presided over a meeting on October 9th, attended by key cadres from the county-level financial and production departments. The main content of the meeting was to determine the production guidelines for this winter, clarify the working relationships of various production departments, strengthen the leadership of this winter's production work, and reorganize the Financial and Economic Committee. The meeting determined that the focus this winter should be on vigorously developing industrial and mining production, emphasizing key leadership. The County Cooperative should strengthen leadership over the District Cooperatives, restore and establish village cooperatives, and organize the masses for production. Stores should purchase sea salt and exchange some grain with the Tài Háng stores to solve Píngdìng's grain difficulties, control physical goods to stabilize prices, facilitate and organize mass transportation, and actively open up sales channels for coal and iron industry products. The Bank will continue to recover old loans, and future loans will mainly focus on supporting industrial and mining production. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce should correct the simplistic view of simply collecting taxes, conscientiously grasp and implement industrial and commercial policies, and, in conjunction with the County Federation of Trade Unions, organize the establishment of an iron factory, restore the Liánzhuāng coal kiln, transform four existing sand-turning furnaces, improve technology, and reduce costs. The Construction Section should strengthen leadership in winter agricultural, sideline, and handicraft industries. After the meeting, investigations were conducted separately to understand the situation in order to realize the development production guidelines and plans.
