　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. TASS reports: *Pravda* published an article on the 2nd stating: Stalin's conversation with reporters from *Pravda* is the focus of attention worldwide, largely determining the content of foreign newspapers and radio commentaries. Stalin accurately assessed the current policies of the US and British leaders as aggressive policies, policies of launching a new war. They cannot escape this assessment, which is fully based on facts and summarizes the experience of post-war international relations. No matter how imperialist propaganda distorts the facts, this assessment has struck the hearts of hundreds of millions of people who yearn for peace and demand the elimination of the danger of a new war. The forces of peace are vast, and this force will continue to grow.
    According to Telecommunications: The famous British writer George Bernard Shaw wrote in the London *Daily Worker* on the 2nd: "Stalin's frank and stern words bring a breath of fresh air." He continued: "If it were not for the worldwide foundation of communism, modern civilization would be completely impossible. Without communism, humanity would starve to death."

　　斯大林对记者的谈话是全球当前注意焦点
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社讯：真理报于二日著文称：斯大林对真理报记者的谈话，是全世界当前注意的焦点，在很大程度上决定着外国报纸和广播评论的内容。斯大林恰当地评定美、英领袖目前的政策是侵略政策，是发动新战争的政策。他们逃不脱这一充分根据事实、总结了战后国际关系经验的评断。不管帝国主义的宣传如何歪曲事实，这一评断已经打入亿万渴求和平、要求消除新战争危险的人们的心坎。和平的力量是浩大的，这种力量还将继续增长。
    又据电通讯讯：英名作家萧伯纳二日在伦敦工人日报上撰文称：“斯大林坦率与严正的言辞，使人呼吸到新鲜空气。”继称：要不是因为有全世界范围的共产主义的基础，现代文明就完全不可能。没有共产主义，人类就会饿死。
