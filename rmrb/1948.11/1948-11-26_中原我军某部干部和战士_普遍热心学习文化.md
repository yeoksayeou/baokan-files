Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 18th. The cadres and soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in the Central Plains are universally carrying out a cultural learning movement. In the past two months, the cultural level of cadres and soldiers has improved significantly. Illiterate people in the past have generally learned more than 100 characters. Before carrying out cultural learning, 60% of the soldiers in the special service company of a certain regiment were illiterate. Now, except for two soldiers who can only write their names and the words "People's Liberation Army," most of them have learned more than 120 characters. More than half of the soldiers can write simple blackboard newspaper articles. After the new-style military consolidation movement, the class consciousness of cadres and soldiers has generally improved. Therefore, they feel that their low cultural level not only hinders their progress but also causes many serious difficulties in their work. Some people say, "We are a revolutionary army, and learning culture is as important as eating." In terms of learning methods, they adopt the method of "learning whatever is needed" and mutual teaching and learning, seizing every possible opportunity to learn. When marching, they hang literacy cards on their backpacks and learn while walking. They also established a weekly test system, combined with criticism and praise, to carry out the learning movement in a planned and organized manner.

　　中原我军某部干部和战士
  　普遍热心学习文化
    【新华社中原前线十八日电】中原人民解放军某部全体干部、战士普遍开展文化学习运动。两个月以来，干部、战士文化水平已有显著提高，过去的文盲一般都学会了一百个字以上。某团特务连在开展文化学习前，该连中不识字的占全连人数百分之六十，现在除两个战士只能写自己的名和“人民解放军”几个字外，一般都学会到一百二十个字以上。半数以上的战士能写简单的门板报稿。经过新式整军运动后，干部与战士的阶级觉悟普遍提高，因而感到文化水平低，不仅阻碍自己进步，且在工作中感到许多严重困难。有的人说：“我们是革命军队，学习文化和吃饭一样重要。”在学习方法上，采用“用着哪个就学哪个”和互教互学的办法，抓紧每一个可能的机会去学。行军时把识字牌挂在背包上，边走边学。并建立每周一次的测验制度，结合批评与表扬，有计划有组织地开展学习运动。
