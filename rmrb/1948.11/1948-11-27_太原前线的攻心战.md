　　Psychological Warfare on the Taiyuan Front
　　Ren Bingru, Tang Renjun
　　Verbal battles are truly good, they can match several howitzer cannons.
　　Fire line appeals are excellent, winning battles without wasting bullets!
　　These are two popular slogans among the People's Liberation Army on the Taiyuan front. Faced with the powerful military pressure of the People's Liberation Army, the morale of the Yan bandit army officers and soldiers was low, and they lost confidence in the bunkers and fortifications. Once surrounded and separated, and freed from the rule of the Yan bandit secret agents, they surrendered to the People's Liberation Army in whole companies and platoons. Many liberated soldiers and newly liberated army officers immediately used their personal experiences to persuade the enemy to surrender on the front lines. Our army's correct policy towards prisoners of war has deeply penetrated the minds of the Yan army officers and soldiers. Widespread frontline appeals can win over large numbers of Yan army soldiers guarding the bunkers to lay down their weapons. Although the Yan bandits have adopted methods of secret agent surveillance, changing defense areas, and "unyielding orders" (Yan bandits ordering subordinates to coexist with the positions and die for him), they cannot prevent and even further促其 large numbers of officers and soldiers from surrendering and running away. The following are a few excerpts from the battles around Taiyuan.

　　We wanted to surrender a long time ago!

　　At 10:00 AM on October 7th, when Guo Shusu, Li Shuangquan, and two other comrades from our 1313 unit approached the plum blossom bunker south of Huangling Village, less than 100 meters away, a platoon from the machine gun company of the Yan army’s 18th Security Regiment, including platoon leader Yan Cunshi and 23 others, were still sound asleep. When our machine gun fired, the sentry on the blockhouse was so scared that he trembled, and the eight or nine new recruits in the bunker didn't know where to hide. Yan Cunshi said, "There are our own people in front, don't misunderstand, don't dare to shoot." Because he had worked under the Yan bandits for fourteen years and was still a platoon leader, and his family food rations were canceled in August, his wife had no way to live, and he had no interest in fighting. When our army fired a cannon into the blockhouse, he told the soldiers to come down and block the gun holes, not to fight at all, and prepared to surrender. When our army comrade Guo Shusu approached and shouted, "Surrender and don't kill, but treat you well," he said to the soldiers, "Brothers, did you hear that? If you want to live, surrender, if you want to die, don't surrender!" Then, he opened the bunker door and said, "We wanted to surrender a long time ago." Eighteen people came out with four machine guns and eight rifles.

　　I brought the entire platoon of brothers over here.

　　On October [date redacted], our army captured the No. 4 bunker in Nanpingtou in one fell swoop, and the Yan bandit's forward position on the Mazhuang defense line was controlled by us. The rear of the No. 1 bunker south of Zaoyuan Village had been cut off. The cook who delivered food to the guarding soldiers of the No. 1 bunker from Zaoyuan was also knocked down on the road. The Yan army soldiers trapped in the turtle shell were unable to drink water, and hunger and fatigue made them panic day and night.

　　On the night of the 19th, Wang Senmao, a newly liberated squad leader from the No. 4 bunker, took a letter of persuasion to surrender from Wang Xie [name correction needed], an officer of the 73rd Division of the PLA, and crawled from Nanpingtou to near the No. 1 bunker in Zaoyuan to find his original unit, the 3rd Battalion of the 277th Regiment. But unfortunately, the Yan army guarding the No. 1 bunker had already been replaced by the 2nd Company of the 217th Regiment. Originally, in order to prevent officers and soldiers from surrendering on the front lines, the Yan bandits frequently rotated the guarding forces. Some bunkers even had their original structures disrupted.

　　The second platoon leader of the 2nd Company of the Yan army's 217th Regiment, guarding the No. 1 bunker, was wounded by our regiment's attacking troops. Platoon leader Zhang Shilong had just been transferred to the No. 1 bunker on the 19th to take over the defense. When he received the task of guarding the No. 1 bunker, his scalp tingled a bit. He saw that the expressions on the faces of the battalion commander and company commander were gloomy. After the battalion commander assigned the task and left, the company commander saw that he was in a bad mood and said to him, "Don't be so rigid in your thinking, don't be bound by the 'unyielding order', you can retreat when necessary."

　　Zhang Shilong had only stayed in the No. 1 bunker for one night and was not very familiar with the brothers. In the morning of the 20th, the brothers brought a stranger into the bunker, who had escaped back from being captured at the No. 4 bunker in Nanpingtou, saying that he was going back to find a [number unclear] unit of the 3rd Battalion of the 217th Regiment. Zhang Shilong asked with great concern, "How many troops did the Eighth Route Army use to attack Mazhuang? How many cannons were there?" Wang Senmao told him that the People's Liberation Army surrounded Mazhuang with a division of troops, and he had personally seen more than ten mountain guns, field guns, and heavy guns, and directly told him that he had seen Division Commander Wang [Xie?] (referring to Division Commander Wang [Xie?] of the 73rd Division, which was liberated in the Jinzhong Campaign). Zhang Shilong asked in surprise, "Didn't I hear that Division Commander Wang had been killed by the Communists?" Wang Senmao said, "Division Commander Wang is doing very well over there, and he even brought a letter."

　　Zhang Shilong said, "The division commander's letter isn't asking us to go over there, is it!" He didn't recognize many characters. Wang explained: "The division commander sent someone to rescue you, telling the brothers to go over quickly! Otherwise, they will bomb you when it gets light." Zhang Shilong held the letter and was still a little skeptical: was this matter reliable? He saw that it was stamped with Division Commander Wang's seal and said, "This can't be wrong." He thought to himself that he didn't want to do it when he accepted the task of guarding the bunker, and now wasn't it a good opportunity to escape for his life? He said to Wang, "The division commander must let me go home when I get there." The senior sergeant platoon deputy Zhao Wenzhong was also nearby. He was still worried that if he surrendered to the People's Liberation Army, he would have to go to the front lines as a vanguard. Wang Senmao explained: "The People's Liberation Army has a policy of treating officers and soldiers who lay down their weapons well, don't fall for Yan Xishan's deceptive slogans." He also said that Division Commander Wang instructed that they should cross over immediately, otherwise they would be bombarded when it got light. At this time, Zhao Wenzhong said, "Whatever the platoon leader says, we'll do it."

　　They made the decision to stop resisting and felt that sixth squad leader Wu Jie was a "backbone of the iron army" and would not be easy to control. Zhang Shilong ordered the platoon deputy to call the squad leaders together for a meeting. Zhang Shilong said to everyone, "Our rear has been cut off, and it's impossible to rely on reinforcements. They can't even send us food and drink. It's only a matter of being shelled if we stay in this turtle shell; If we retreat, we'll be beheaded according to the 'unyielding order', what are you going to do?" The squad leaders had long been frightened by our army's shells and were silent. Platoon Leader Zhang said, "Anyway, I want to escape to save my life. I don't care about the team, let the platoon deputy take care of it." Zhao Wenzhong said, "I can't control it either. You go ahead, and I'll follow behind." Sixth squad leader Wu Jie was the first to say, "Whatever the platoon leader says, I'll do it." Then the squad leaders unanimously expressed their willingness to follow the platoon leader to find a way to survive. The brothers had long been unwilling to wait to die in this turtle shell. Wang Senmao's letter was like a bomb, blooming in the hearts of every soldier in the bunker. The Yan bandits' "iron army backbone" and "unyielding order", on which they relied to rule the soldiers, completely collapsed. Platoon Leader Zhang asked everyone, "Are you really unwilling to do it?" Everyone unanimously said, "At this time, who is willing to follow Yan Xishan to the funeral."

　　Platoon Leader Zhang ordered the entire platoon to pack their things, prepare food in advance, and prepare to surrender to the People's Liberation Army.

　　On the 20th, there was no fierce fighting on the front lines. Fourteen people from the second platoon of the 2nd Company of the 217th Regiment of the 73rd Division of the PLA waved white flags continuously from the bunker. The brothers detoured around our army's cordon and arrived at our rear headquarters. Wang Senmao saw the deputy political director of our [number unclear] regiment and said with a smile, "Reporting to the director, I have brought the entire platoon of brothers over here."

　　Ren Yueliang's "Personal Account"

　　At dusk on October 8th, only the last of the three bunkers southwest of Beiying and northwest of Huangling was left. The soldiers took the enemy company commander who had been captured at the time to shout at the bunker, but there was no response from the bunker. At this time, Ren Yueliang, who was liberated in the Beiying battle in Jinzhong, walked less than twenty meters away from the enemy and shouted: "I was liberated in Jinzhong, the People's Liberation Army doesn't kill prisoners, but treats them well, are you surrendering or not? If you don't surrender, we will use dynamite to blow you up, you surrender quickly..."

　　Inside, they asked: "Who is shouting outside? Is it Ren Yueliang from Duancun Village in Jiaocheng? When did you get there? Are they not killing people over there? Do they kill the officers?"

　　Ren Yueliang replied: "I am Ren Yueliang, are you Zhou Cun Xingtai? I came from the Beiying battle, it's very good over here, equal treatment, democracy in everything, soldiers and officers are the same, I guarantee not to kill, if they were killing, I would have been gone."

　　Inside, they said: "It's okay to guarantee that the officers won't be killed, there are three parts inside, I'll discuss it with others..." Then another person came and said: "I'm Xu Ailun, we used to work together, is it really good over there?" Ren Yueliang said: "It's good over here, not only don't they kill you, they don't even beat you, it's the same as with the old comrades, you don't get angry, unlike over there, you get beaten and scolded for anything you do wrong, and you can't even get enough to eat, over here, you can eat enough noodles..." Inside, they said: "We've discussed it, we surrender!" "It's good to surrender, bring all your belongings, the Eighth Route Army doesn't want personal belongings."

　　For a while, the door opened, and the platoon leader came over with twenty-six people, one heavy machine gun, two light machine guns, and three small cannons.

　　Zhang Desheng and Liu Jincai cooperate in shouting

　　On October 9th, in Beiying, Zhang Desheng, an enemy work cadre from our 1313 unit, took the Yan army company commander Liu Jincai, who had just been captured, to shout at the No. 12 bunker in Beiying West. Liu Jincai shouted to the garrison of the No. 12 bunker: "Platoon Leader Liu and comrades, I am your company commander Liu Jincai, did you hear me shouting?..." He shouted again, but the enemy didn't say anything. Comrade Zhang Desheng said in the tone of a captured soldier: "Platoon Leader Liu, our company commander has worked so hard, didn't you hear him, why don't you say anything? I just had breakfast with our company commander, the People's Liberation Army's lenient policy has now been experienced personally, we were given mutton and white flour to eat, it's the same for me and the captain, did you hear that? If you don't come over, you won't dare to talk to the captain!"

　　Inside, they said: "We used to be afraid that the Eighth Route Army would kill us."

　　Company Commander Liu said: "If they were going to kill someone, they should kill me first, it's guaranteed not to kill, if I lie to you, I'm not born of human parents!"

　　Inside, they asked: "What about our things?" Some Yan army officers and soldiers still didn't understand the policy of the People's Army not wanting the private belongings of prisoners, so cadre Zhang explained: "The Eighth Route Army doesn't take a single thing from our personal belongings, and the things of me and our captain are still on our backs! Come out quickly, what are you waiting for!"

　　Inside, they said: "Then we'll go out!" "Why aren't you coming out yet?" "We're getting our things!" After a while, sure enough, one by one they came out carrying big bundles, carrying a heavy machine gun, four boxes of ammunition, three bags of foreign flour, and two rifles, eight people came out together.

　　太原前线的攻心战
    任冰如　唐仁均
    嘴巴仗，真是好，能顶几门榴弹炮。
    火线喊话顶漂亮，不费子弹打胜仗！
    这是太原前线解放军普遍流行的两句口号。在解放军强大军事压力面前，士气低落，对碉堡工事丧失信心的阎匪军官兵，一经包围分割，脱离阎匪特务统治之后，便整连整排的向解放军投诚。不少解放战士和新解放军官，当场现身说法，火线劝降；我军正确的俘虏政策，已相当深入阎军官兵心里。普遍开展火线喊话，便能争取大批阎军守碉官兵放下武器。阎匪虽然采取特务监视，调换防地，“未梗手令”（阎匪要部属与阵地共存亡，替他送死的命令）亦无法阻止而且更促使其大批官兵投诚逃跑。下面是太原外围作战中的几个片断故事。
    我们早想缴枪了！
    十月七日，上午十时，我一三一三部郭树素、李双全等四人，接近了黄陵村南梅花碉不满百米的时候，阎军保十八团机枪中队的一个排，阎存世排长等二十四人，还正在蒙头大睡，我们机枪一响，岗楼上的哨兵吓的直打颤，碉堡里八九个新兵也不知道往哪里钻。阎存世说：“前面有自己人，不要发生误会，不敢打枪。”因为他在阎匪手下干了十四年，还是个排长，八月又取消了眷属粮，他的老婆没法生活，对打仗毫无兴趣。当我军一炮打进炮楼，他就叫士兵下来，塞住枪眼，根本不打，准备投降，我军郭树素同志逼到跟前喊：“交枪不杀还宽待。”他就对士兵说：“弟兄们，听见了没有，要留活路就缴枪，要死就不缴枪！”接着，他打开碉堡门说：“我们早想缴枪了。”十八个人带着四挺机枪，八支步枪走了出来。
    我把全排弟兄都带过来了。
    十月×日，我军一举攻占南坪头四号碉，阎匪马庄防线前哨阵地为我控制。枣园村南一号碉的后路已经切断了。从枣园给一号碉守备士兵送饭的伙夫，也被打倒在路上，困守乌龟壳的阎军士兵，喝不上水，饥饿和疲劳弄的日夜恐慌不安。
    十九日夜，四号碉新解放的下士班长王森茂，带着七十三辆解放军官王檄＠的一封劝降信，从南坪头爬到枣园一号碉附近，去找二七七团三营原来的部队。可是不凑巧，一号碉守备阎军已经换成二一七团二连了。原来阎匪为了防止前线官兵火线投诚，经常把守备兵力调换使用。有些碉堡连原来的建制也打乱了。
    守一号碉的阎军二连二排长，被我团攻部队打伤了。一排长张世龙十九日刚调到一号碉接防，他接到去守一号碉任务时，头皮就有些发麻，他看见营长和连长脸上的神情，都是阴沉沉的。营长分配任务走了，连长看见他情绪不好，曾对他说：“你脑筋别那样死，不要被‘未梗手令’束缚住了，必要时可以退下来”。
    张世龙刚到一号碉住了一夜，和弟兄们还不很熟，二十日天明，弟兄们带进碉堡一个陌生的人，是从南坪头四号碉被俘跑回来的，说是要转回去找二一七团三营×部队。张世龙很关切的问：“八路军攻打马庄的兵力多大？有多少大炮？”王森茂告诉他：解放军围攻马庄有一师多兵力，亲眼看见十多门山炮、野炮和重炮，并且直接告诉他曾经看见了王师长（指晋中战役大常解放之七十三师师长王檄＠）。张世龙很惊异的问：“不是听说王师长已被共军杀了吗？”王森茂说：“王师长在那边很好，还给捎来有封信呢。”
    张世龙说：“师长来信不是叫我们过去的吧！”他不很识字，王给解释：“师长派人来救你们，叫弟兄们赶快过去！”张世龙拿着信还有些怀疑：这事情是否可靠？他看见上面盖有王师长的图章，说：“这不会错。”心想我接受守备碉堡任务时早就不想干了，这时候还不是逃命的好机会。他对王说：“过去师长可得让我回家哩。”上士排副赵文中也在跟前，他还顾虑投诚了解放军，要到前线当尖兵。王森茂给解释说：“解放军宽待放下武器官兵的政策，别上阎锡山欺骗口号的当。”并说王师长吩咐，要过立即就过，不然天明了就要换炮轰。这时赵文中表示：“排长说怎办咱就怎办吧。”
    他们下了决心停止抵抗，感到六班长吴杰是个“铁军基干”，可不好掌握。张世龙就叫排副召集班长一块开会。张世龙向大家说：“咱们后路已经断了，靠增援根本不行，后面给送点吃喝也来不了，守着这乌龟壳只有挨炮弹；退回去吧，有‘未梗手令’要杀头，你们怎么办吧？”几个班长早被我军炮弹轰的心神不定，都没有话说。张排长说：“反正我是想逃个活命，队伍咱不管，叫排副招呼吧。”赵文中说：“我也管不了，你前边走，我后边也过去。”六班长吴杰首先表示：“排长说怎我就怎。”接着各班长一致表示愿跟着排长找一条活路，弟兄们早不愿在这个乌龟壳里等死了。王森茂的一封信，象一颗炸弹，在碉堡内部每个战士心上开花了。阎匪所赖以统治士兵的“铁军基干”、“未梗手令”完全垮台了。张排长向大家说：“是不是真心不干了？”大家一致表示：“这时候，谁还愿意跟着阎老西去送葬。”
    张排长就命令全排收拾东西，提前作饭，准备向解放军投诚。
    二十号白天，前线上没有激烈的战斗。七十三师二一七团第二连二排十四个人，拿着白旗从碉堡连续摇摆，弟兄们就绕道我军警戒线，到达我后方指挥部。王森茂见了我军×团政治副主任，满脸笑容的说：“报告主任，我把全排弟兄都带过来了。”
    任月亮“现身说法”
    十月八日黄昏，北营西南、黄陵西北的三个碉堡只剩最后一个了，战士们带了当时俘虏的敌连长去喊话，碉堡里没有吭声。这时，在晋中北营战斗被解放的任月亮走到离敌人不到二十米远的地方喊道：“我是晋中解放过来的，解放军不杀俘虏，还要优待，你们交枪呢不交枪？不交枪就用炸药炸，你们快交枪吧……”
    里面问了：“外边喊话的是谁？是交城段村任月亮不是？你啥时候到那厢的？那厢不杀吧？对当官的杀不杀呢？”
    任月亮答：“我是任月亮，你是周村兴泰吧，我是北营战斗过来的，这厢很好，平等对待，遇事讲民主，当兵当官的都一样，我保证不杀，要杀的话，我早没有了。”
    里面说：“能保住当官的不杀就行，这里面是三部分，我和别人商量商量……”接着又来一个说：“我是许爱伦，咱们过去在一块干，那厢到底好不好呢？”任月亮说：“这厢好，不但不杀，连打的都没有，和老同志一样，不受气，不象那边，一点事不顺就挨打受骂，那连吃不饱，这边吃面管吃够……”里面说：“我们商量好了，交枪！”“交枪就好，把你们东西都带上，八路军不要私人的东西。”
    一时门开了，排长带着二十六个人，一挺重机枪，两挺轻机枪，三门小炮过来了。
    张德胜刘锦采配合喊话
    十月九日在北营，我一三一三部敌工干事张德胜带着刚才俘虏的阎军连长刘锦采，到北营西十二号碉喊话，刘锦采对十二号碉的守军喊：“刘排长跟大家同志们，俺是你们的连长刘锦采，你们听见喊没有？……”他又叫，敌人不吭声，张德胜同志就以被俘士兵口气说：“刘排长，咱们连长下了这样大的辛苦，你们没有听见，怎么连气都不吭？俺是和咱连长才吃了早饭过来的，解放军的宽大政策现在亲身经过了，给我们吃的是羊肉白面，我和队长吃的都一样，你们听见啦没有？过来不过来就不敢和队长谈谈话！”
    里面说：“俺们过去怕八路军杀。”
    刘连长说：“要杀先该杀俺，保险不杀，我骗你们就不是人生父母养的！”
    里面问：“俺们的东西呢？”阎军官兵，还有人不了解人民军队不要俘虏私人东西的政策，张干事就给解答：“八路军不拿咱们私人一点东西，我和咱队长的东西还都背着哩！快出来吧，有啥等头！”
    里面说：“那俺们就出去啦！”“怎么还不出来？”“俺们拿东西啦！”不一会，果真一个一个背着大包袱带着一挺重机枪，四箱弹药，三袋洋面，两只步枪，八个人一齐出来了。
