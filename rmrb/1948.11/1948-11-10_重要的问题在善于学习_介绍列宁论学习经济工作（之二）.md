　　“The Important Thing Is to Be Good at Learning”
    Introducing Lenin on Studying Economic Work (Part 2)
    Chen Boda
    Objectively speaking, many of the mistakes we have made were difficult to avoid at certain times, even unavoidable, because we had never done them before. When starting to do something, it is possible to make all sorts of mistakes. However, it is unacceptable for us to keep making mistakes without correcting them. We must strive to transform ourselves.
    　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    In order to fully explain Comrade Mao Zedong's important policy of "The Important Thing Is to Be Good at Learning," I would like to introduce here many extremely valuable words spoken by Lenin after the October Revolution, during the period when he implemented the New Economic Policy, regarding the need for Communists to learn to do economic work. Although we and the Soviet Union are now in different revolutionary situations and under different historical conditions, as mentioned above, our New Democratic economy already has coexisting state enterprises with socialist elements and private capitalism. As the revolutionary situation expands, more and more enterprises of bureaucratic capital fall into our hands and become New Democratic state enterprises. At the same time, we are still facing the extremely vast economy of scattered small producers. Therefore, we are encountering complex economic problems with major historical significance, and Lenin's words on learning to do economic work are as if they were spoken directly to us. Lenin's words are not only beneficial for us to learn how to do business but are also equally beneficial for us to learn how to do all kinds of economic work.

    Lenin said: "I understand that it does take time for Communists to learn how to do business, and anyone who is willing to learn this will make serious mistakes in the first few years, but history will forgive him, because this is something new for him." (Report at the meeting of the Communist Party faction of the All-Russian Congress of Metalworkers' Union, March 6, 1922)

    Lenin said that history will forgive us for some unavoidable mistakes, even serious ones. However, Lenin tells us not to be blinded by mistakes. Lenin said:
    "...The most important thing is to be able to calmly see where the mistake occurred and start all over again. If we have to start all over again not just twice, but many times, then this shows that we have no prejudice and are dealing with the greatest task in the world with a calm perspective." (Political Report of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to the Eleventh Congress, March 27, 1922)

    That is to say: We are responsible to the people, we have a great historical mission, we must remove prejudices, calmly find the root of the mistakes, and dare to correct the mistakes and start all over again. Lenin said:

    "If all Communists, responsible personnel, can clearly realize that we cannot do things, that we must learn from scratch, then victory will surely be ours—in my opinion, this is the most fundamental conclusion." (Ibid.)

    If we are good at learning, we will surely win. This is Lenin's conclusion.

    Lenin repeatedly described the criticisms and expectations of the peasants and even the workers towards the Communists in Russia after liberation:
    "...At present, the peasants are giving us credit; ...they will say: 'Well, if you can't do it now, then we will wait, maybe you will learn.' However, this credit is not endless."
    "We must know this, and we must start working immediately after gaining credit. We should know that the time when this country with a peasant majority will no longer give us credit, the time when it demands repayment (to use a commercial term), is getting closer and closer. They will say: 'Now, dear rulers, after delaying for so many months and so many years, you must have found the most correct and reliable way to help us get rid of poverty, hardship, hunger, and bankruptcy. You are capable of doing something, and you have proven it.' This is the test that we will inevitably encounter; in the final analysis, this test will determine the fate of the New Economic Policy and the fate of the Russian Communist regime." (Ibid.)
    "Capitalists can handle supply. But they do it very poorly, they do it in a predatory way, they insulted us, they plundered us. The simple workers and peasants who do not know what communism is all know this.
    'But capitalists can always handle supply, can you? ...You are all outstanding and remarkable people, but you are not good at the business you are undertaking, the economic business.' This is the simplest and most fatal criticism that the peasants—and through the peasants, many workers—made of the Communist Party last year (note: referring to 1921)...."

    "There needs to be a real check. Capitalists are operating side by side. They are operating like robbers, they are profit-oriented, but they are doing it skillfully. But what about you?—Try to do it in a new way: you don't make a profit; your communist principles, your ideals are excellent, these principles and ideals are written so beautifully, to be honest, you should go to heaven as saints—but can you do business? There really needs to be a check, a real check, not the kind of check that the Central Supervisory Commission investigates and punishes, nor the kind of check that the All-Russian Central Executive Committee punishes. What we need is not such a check, but a real check from the perspective of the national economy."
    "Communists have been allowed to postpone repayment many times, and the amount of credit given to them is more than any other government has ever received. Of course, the Communists have helped the peasants to liberate themselves from the oppression of capitalists and landlords, and the peasants attach great importance to this, so they have given the Communists credit for postponement, but this postponement has a certain limit... Then, there will be a check: can you manage things no worse than others? The old capitalists can do it, but you can't." (Ibid.)

    The criticisms and expectations made by the peasants and even the workers twenty-five or twenty-six years ago, as described by Lenin, towards the Soviet Communists who were still very unfamiliar with economic work at the time, are now being encountered here as well. We are encountering similar criticisms and expectations. Many people criticize us, feeling that capitalists are better than us at running not only commerce but also industry. The peasants here also expect that after we have helped them to liberate themselves from the oppression of feudal, semi-feudal, and bureaucratic capital, we can "obtain a most correct and reliable method" to continue to help them "alleviate poverty, hardship, hunger, and bankruptcy." The peasants here also expect us to provide them with more goods, expect us to be good at linking industry and agriculture, be good at linking the peasants economically, and prevent them from being oppressed by speculators who buy cheap and sell dear; they hope that we will be good at fighting against speculators who undermine the national economy. The peasants here also believe that we are capable of doing so, because under our leadership, they have personally experienced fundamental benefits and believe in our loyalty to the people's cause, and believe in our ability. All the people of China know that the Chinese Communists are the most capable and remarkable people in China who can turn the world upside down, and know that we can learn anything, and will learn better than others, even ten thousand times better, as long as we are willing to learn. If the Chinese Communists are incompetent, then China has no hope. However, in our liberated areas, whether workers, peasants, or other people, in addition to being happy with what we have already delivered, also expect us not to delay the other things that have not yet been delivered for too long, but to deliver them more quickly. Of course, we have some fundamental methods. Comrade Mao Zedong's writings have also long pointed out the path for us to continue to alleviate the poverty of the peasants after carrying out land reform, but in many places, we do not follow Comrade Mao Zedong's policies, do not concretize them, or do them very crudely, very unrealistically, and very impatiently, so we have prolonged the time for delivery.

    There is no doubt that we are also encountering a test, a test on the entire economic front (including industry, agriculture, commerce, and finance), and this test will determine the fate of China's New Democratic politics and economy, as well as the future transition from New Democracy to socialism.

    There is no doubt that under the guidance of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet Communists have learned so brilliantly and done so spectacularly. Therefore, we Chinese Communists, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, will certainly not disappoint the expectations of our Chinese people. Whatever the Soviet Communists can do, we can also do the same. The fundamental condition is that we Chinese Communists must be able to learn as well as the Soviet Communists.

    Lenin believed that we must learn repeatedly, learn even if we don't understand, learn even if we don't understand, until we achieve our goal.

    "I repeat: As a result of our correct policies, we have obtained credit and postponement from the masses of the people. In the terms of the New Economic Policy, this is a promissory note, but there is no date on this promissory note, and you do not know when they will demand repayment. This is where the danger lies, and this is the difference between a political promissory note and an ordinary commercial promissory note. We must focus all our attention on this point, and not think that it is enough to have responsible and excellent Communists in all state-owned trusts and joint ventures, because these Communists are not good at doing business, they are far less skilled than ordinary capitalist clerks who have been trained in large factories and large companies. We have not realized this fact; to use that same great Russian expression, the conceit of the Communists still exists here. The problem is that the responsible Communist—although he is the best, although he is very honest and loyal, although he has endured hard labor and is not afraid of death—cannot do business, because he is not a businessman, he has not learned how to do business, and he does not want to learn, nor does he understand that he must learn from ABC. A Communist, a revolutionary who has carried out the greatest revolution in the world, a person who is watched by all eyes (if not by forty pyramids, then at least by forty countries in Europe) and holds the hope of liberation from capitalism—he should learn from an ordinary clerk, this clerk has ten years of store experience, he knows how to do business; while the responsible Communist and loyal revolutionary not only does not know how to run a business, but he has not even realized that he does not know how to run a business."
    "Therefore, comrades, if we can correct this initial ignorance, then this will be a great victory. When we leave this congress, we should be sure that we do not yet understand this, and we should learn from ABC later. After all, we are revolutionaries (although many people say—not entirely without reason—that we have become bureaucratic), we can understand this simple thing: that in a new and very difficult job, we should be good at starting over several times; if after starting, you hit a wall, then you start again, even if you revise it ten times, until you achieve your goal, don't put on airs because you are a Communist, and don't be arrogant again, you should know that a non-Party store clerk, maybe a White Party member—let's just assume he is a White Party member—is very good at doing some things that are indispensable in the economy, but you are not. If you are a responsible Communist, with hundreds of official titles, and a 'meritorious servant' of the Communist Party and the Soviets, if you understand this, then you will definitely achieve your goal, because this kind of thing can be learned."
    "Although we have had small achievements in the past year (note: referring to 1921), these achievements are small and insignificant. The main thing is that all Communists do not yet have this broad understanding and awareness, that at present, this ability of ours—the most responsible and loyal Communists in Russia—is worse than any old store clerk. I repeat: We must learn from scratch. If we recognize this, then our exam will pass, this exam is very serious, this exam is held by the increasingly approaching financial crisis, and is held by the Russian and international markets to which we are subordinate, connected, and inseparable... This exam is strict, because here, people can defeat us economically and politically." (Ibid., Report at the Eleventh Congress of the Communist Party)

    Obviously, Lenin told us: First of all, we Communists must have a "broad understanding and awareness" (listen, it is a broad understanding, it is a broad awareness), and know that we are not as good as others in this economic work, and then we will seriously learn, and then our exam will pass.
    Because the "competition between socialism and private capital is very fierce," socialism must be able to withstand the test of a financial crisis that causes pain, and withstand the test of domestic and foreign markets; at the time, Lenin warned: "This exam is strict, because here, people can defeat us economically and politically."
    Lenin pointed out that the skills of managing enterprises are related to the level of culture:
    "Here, we must clearly raise the question: Where exactly does our strength lie? What exactly are we lacking? Political power is quite sufficient. Here, it is unlikely that anyone will say that the Communists, the Communist Party, lack power in a certain practical issue, in a certain administrative organ. The basic economic power is in our hands, all the large enterprises, railways, etc., that are of decisive significance are in our hands... What is lacking is obvious: what is now lacking is the cultural level of that part of the Communists who manage state affairs. If we take Moscow as an example—it has 4,700 responsible Communists—if we take this huge bureaucracy as an example, then we must ask: Who is leading whom? I very much doubt whether we can say: those Communists are leading this huge organization. To be honest, they are not leading people, but people are leading them. What is happening here is exactly like the historical stories that people told us in childhood, people taught us that there was a time when one nation conquered another nation, the victorious nation became the conqueror, and the conquered nation became the defeated. This is very simple and clear. But what about the culture of these nations? Here, things are not so simple. If the culture of the victorious nation is higher than that of the defeated nation, then the former forces the latter to accept its culture; in the opposite case, the defeated nation forces the victorious nation to accept its culture. (Note: In our Chinese history, such a thing happened, that is: the defeated Han nationality ended up forcing the victorious Khitan, Jurchen, Mongolian, and Manchu ethnic groups to accept Han culture) In the capital of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, is the same thing also happening? Are these 4,700 Communists (this is close to the number of a division, and they are all the best) also subject to the culture of others? Yes, here people may get the impression that in this case, the defeated have a high culture. But the actual situation is not so. Their culture is very pitiful and small. But it is still higher than our culture. No matter how pitiful and weak it is, it is always higher than the cultural level of our responsible Communist personnel, because these Communist personnel lack the ability to manage affairs. When a Communist leads a certain agency—sometimes, the saboteurs deliberately cater to them cleverly, in order to use them as a cover—they are often deceived and fooled. Admitting this fact is naturally a very unpleasant thing, or at least a not very pleasant thing; however, I think this point must be admitted, because at present, this is exactly where the focus of the problem lies..."
    "Do the responsible Communists of the Soviet Union and the Russian Communist Party understand that they cannot manage? Do they realize that they think they are leading people, but in fact they are being led by people? If they realize this, then they can naturally learn, because this can be learned. For this, we should learn; but our comrades do not learn. Our comrades issue orders and proclamations everywhere, but the results are far from what they want." (Ibid.)
    In the early days of the revolutionary victory, we cannot but admit that our culture is lower than that of others. In our China, this fact is equally obvious. Although here, whether it is the landlord class or the bourgeoisie, their cultural level is even more pitiful and smaller, but as Lenin said, "It is still higher than our culture. No matter how pitiful and weak it is, it is always higher than the cultural level of our responsible Communist workers, because we lack the skills to manage affairs." In this way, we cannot rely on issuing orders and proclamations to solve the problem. We must and can only rely on learning to solve the problem. Here, pride will be foolish and even lead to destruction.
    In April 1921, Lenin had already pointed out in "On the Food Tax":
    "Don't be afraid for Communists to 'learn' from bourgeois specialists, including from merchants, also from small cooperative capitalists, also from capitalists 'learn'. Learning from them should be in another form, but in essence it is the same as we have learned from military experts and learned. The result of 'learning' can only be checked by practical experience: to do better than the bourgeois specialists next door, to be able to use various methods to revitalize agriculture, revitalize industry, and develop the circulation between agriculture and industry. To 'seek advice' do not hesitate to spend money: spending more money to learn is not a pity, as long as you can be taught." About a year after writing these words, Lenin said again:
    "If Communists can use the hands of others to build the economy, and themselves learn from this bourgeoisie, and make the bourgeoisie take a path that is beneficial to the path we want to take, then we can manage this economy. But, if a Communist thinks to himself that I am a responsible Communist, I understand everything, the person I have defeated is much more intelligent than a shop assistant, we have fought in front before, and we have not fought with such people—it is precisely this dominant emotion that is harming us." (Ibid., Report at the Eleventh Congress of the Communist Party)

    Therefore, Lenin pointed out that we must be good at cooperating with non-Party personnel:
    "...It is necessary to reach this point: that the large number of people who cooperate with us and far exceed us in number can carry out work in this way, so that we can be good at supervising and managing their work, we can understand this work, and we can use their hands to do things that are beneficial to communism. The central key to the current situation lies here, because although individual Communists have understood and seen this point, the vast majority of our Party members have not yet realized the necessity of attracting non-Party personnel to participate in the work..."
    It can be completely understood that these opinions of Lenin at that time are applicable to us now.

    We must be good at learning, to learn to make ourselves able to build the economy; to learn in state-owned enterprises, in cooperative enterprises, on the one hand, to be good at cooperating with non-Party specialists, to be good at learning skills from them, on the other hand, we must be good at fighting against sabotage secret agents, wreckers, and malingerers; to learn in the cause of building the entire New Democratic social economy, on the one hand, to be good at forming economic alliances and economic coexistence with those "civilized capitalists" who support the New Democratic regime, run legitimate businesses, and are able to organize production, on the other hand, we must be good at fighting against those "uncivilized capitalists" who engage in speculative businesses and undermine the national economic construction. In this learning process, we must give full play to the creative initiative of various localities and departments as much as possible. As Lenin said in the conclusion of "On the Food Tax": "In the revitalization of the circulation of agriculture and industry, we must in every way strive to develop local initiative, creativity, and independent spirit. Study the practical experience in this area. This experience should be as diverse as possible."
    If someone puts on a bureaucratic airs, shows bureaucratic habits, and is neither good at learning this nor good at learning that, and messes things up, then what should be done? Lenin advocated handing him over to the court, trying him, and imprisoning him. Lenin pointed out that the vast majority of Communists are good, but are not good at handling practical work, follow the old ways, are disorganized, and act recklessly. Lenin said:

    "In our struggle, we must remember that Communists need to be thoughtful. They can tell you beautifully about the revolutionary struggle, about the state of the struggle around the world. But, in order to break the despair of poverty and destitution, we must become a thoughtful, educated, and orderly person; but they cannot do these things. It is not right if we accuse responsible Communists of being dishonest in their work. The vast majority of them—99 percent, it can be said—are not only honest people, but have proved that they were loyal to the revolution under the most difficult conditions before the overthrow of the Tsarist regime and after the revolution, it can be said that they have all dedicated their lives. Therefore, it is fundamentally wrong to try to find the cause of the matter in this regard. What we need is the disposal of the culture of the simplest state affairs. We must deal with it, this matter is a state matter, it is a commercial matter; if there are any obstacles, we should be good at overcoming these obstacles, and hand over those who are bureaucratic to the court. I think the proletarian court is good at punishing, but in order to punish, we should find the criminal. I can guarantee to you that in this incident (note: Lenin refers to an incident at the time of purchasing food from abroad), it will not be possible to find the criminal, please carefully examine it, you can know that there is no criminal, and all there is, is just all kinds of meaningless disturbances, busyness, and unconscious things... No one is good at handling things; no one understands that state affairs should be handled in this way, not in that way. All the White Party members and malingerers have taken advantage of this weakness."
    The kind of person that Lenin blamed who engaged in "all kinds of meaningless disturbances, busyness, and unconscious things" is also what we usually refer to here as crawling empiricists and tedious bureaucrats. In our liberated areas, it is similarly as Lenin pointed out: "The point of the problem is not in holding political power, but in being good at managing and operating, being good at arranging personnel appropriately, being good at avoiding small frictions, so that the national economy is not interrupted." But, what method can be used to turn this kind of empiricist and bureaucrat into "a thoughtful, educated, and orderly person"? Besides being good at learning and learning again, in order to improve their skills in managing affairs, improve their culture, what other method can make us good at handling things, good at managing and operating, good at arranging personnel appropriately, and make the cause that we operate and manage able to quickly catch up with others and compete with others?

    Lenin's conclusion on the work of the Soviet Communist Party in April 1922 is now similarly becoming the conclusion of our construction work in the liberated areas of China today. Lenin said: "Now, the whole key lies in the fact that the vanguard should not be afraid to educate itself, transform itself, openly admit that it is not fully prepared and does not have sufficient ability, etc. The whole key lies in the fact that now we must advance together with more infinitely broad and infinitely powerful masses, we must advance together with the peasants, and prove to the peasants with facts, practice, and experience that we are learning, and we want to learn to help them and lead them forward. Under the current international situation in Russia, under the current state of productivity in Russia, this task can only be solved extremely slowly, extremely carefully, step by step, and by actually checking our every step a thousand times." (Speech at the closing of the Eleventh Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks))
    This conclusion is also the last two sentences of Comrade Mao Zedong's speech at the Congress of Labor Heroes and Model Workers of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia in January 1945:
    "China relies on us to build it, we must work hard to learn." (Completely learn economic work within two or three years)

　　“重要的问题在善于学习”
    介绍列宁论学习经济工作（之二）
    陈伯达
    从客观上说来，我们犯过的许多错误，在一定时候是很难避免的，甚至于不可避免的，因为我们过去没有做过，开头要做，也就可能错误百出。然而经常错了不改，这就是我们所不可允许的了。我们必须努力改造我们自己。
    　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    为了能够充分说明毛泽东同志关于“重要的问题在善于学习”这一个重要的方针，这里要特别介绍列宁在十月革命以后，施行新经济政策的一个时期，关于共产党人要学习做经济工作的许多极宝贵的语言。虽然现在我们和苏联是处在不同的革命性质和不同的历史条件之下，但是，如上所说，我们的新民主主义经济已有社会主义成份的国家企业和私人资本主义并存着，而随着革命局面的扩大，官僚资本的企业越多落入我们之手，变成新民主主义的国家企业，同时我们又还面对着极广大的散漫小生产者的经济，因此，我们正遇到有重大历史关系的复杂的经济问题，而列宁这些关于学习做经济工作的语言，就好象就是对我们而说的。列宁这一切语言不只是对我们学做生意有益、而且对我们学做各项经济工作同样有益。
    列宁说：“我懂得，共产党员为了学习经商，的确是需要时间的，凡愿学习此事的任何人，在起初几年之间，都会犯严重的错误的，历史是会宽恕他的，因为这件事情对他是一件新的事情。”（一九二二年三月六日在五金工人联合会全俄代表大会共产党党团会议上的报告）
    列宁说历史是会宽恕我们一些不可避免的错误的，甚至是严重的错误。但是，列宁告诉我们：不要在错误面前盲目起来。列宁说：
    “……最主要的是，要能冷静地会看出这种错误究竟是在那里发生的，再从头重新做起。如果我们不只是两次，而是很多次不得不从头做起的话，那末，这正表示出我们没有偏见，是以冷静的观点来处理我们在世界上最伟大的任务的。”（俄国共产党（布）中央委员会在第十一次代表大会上的政治报告。一九二二年三月二十七日）
    就是说：我们对人民负责，负有历史上伟大的任务，要去掉偏见，要冷静地找到错误的根源，敢于改正错误，从头重新做起。列宁说：
    “如果一切共产党员，负责的工作人员，都能明白地意识到：我们不会做事，我们必须从头学起，那时，胜利就一定是我们的了——在我的意见看来，这就是一个最根本的结论”。（同上）
    善于学习，则我们一定胜利。这就是列宁的结论。
    列宁曾经反复地描写了当时俄国解放之后的农民以至工人对于共产党人的批评与期待：
    “……在现时，农民正以信用贷予我们；……他们会说：‘好吧，如果你们现在还不能这样做的话，那末，我们就等一等吧，也许你们会学会的。’不过，这种信用不能是无穷无尽的。”
    “这一点，我们是必须知道的，在获得信用之后，要立刻着手作的。应当知道：这个农民占多数的国家不再给我们以信用的时机，它要求兑现（要是用一个商业上的术语来说的话）的时期，日益迫近了。他们将说：‘现在就是这样吧，亲爱的统治者们，你们在延期这末多月和这末多年之后，一定能获得一种最正确最可靠的、帮助我们解脱贫困、穷苦、饥饿及破产的办法吧。你们是能够有所作为的，这一点，你们也曾经证明过了。’我们不可避免地将要碰到的试验，就是这样；归根到底，这个试验将要决定新经济政策的命运及俄国共产主义政权的命运的。”（同上）
    “资本家是会办供给的。但是他们作得非常不高明，他们是强盗式地作的，他们侮辱了我们，他们掠夺了我们。那般不知共产主义是何物的单纯工人和农民，都是知道这个的。
    ‘但是资本家总是会办供给的，你们会吗？……你们都是一些杰出的了不起的人物，但是你们所担负的那事业，经济事业，你们却是不会作的。’这就是农民——而且通过农民，还有很多工人——在去年（按：指一九二一年）对共产党所作的最单纯最致命的批评。………”
    “需要来一个真正的检查。资本家正在并肩地活动着。他们正在强盗般地活动着，他们惟利是图，但是他们是作得很巧妙的。但是你们呢？——你们试用新的方法作一下吧：你们并不获利；你们的共产主义原则，你们的理想是好极了，这些原则和理想写得这样美丽，老实说，你们是理应入天国为圣贤的——然而你们会做生意吗？实在需要来一个检查，一个真实的检查，这并不是中央监察委员会加以调查和责罚的这种检查，也不是全俄中央执行委员会加以惩罚的这种检查。我们所需要的，不是这样的检查，而是站在国民经济见地上的那种真正的检查。”
    “允许共产党人延期兑现，已经有过好多次了，贷给他们的信用之多，也是任何其他政府所从未得过的。自然，共产党人曾经帮助农民从资本家与大地主的压迫下解放了出来，农民是极重视这一点的，因此，他们给了共产党人以延期兑现的信用，但这种延期，总有一定限度的………。然后，就要来一个检查的：你们能不能把事情经营的不比别人坏呢？旧的资本家是会做的，而你们却是不会的。”（同上）
    二十五六年前列宁所描写的农民以至工人对于当时在经济工作上还很生疏的苏联共产党员所作的批评与期待，现在在我们这里，也正是遇到了。我们正遇到着类似的批评与期待。很多人批评我们，觉得不但商业，而且工业，资本家要比我们会搞。我们这里的农民也期待我们在帮助他们从封建半封建及官僚资本的压迫之下解放出来之后，能够更“获得一种最正确最可靠的办法”，继续帮助他们“解说贫困、穷苦、饥饿及破产”。我们这里的农民也期待我们能多供给他们一些物品，期待我们善于把工业和农业联系起来，善于把农民在经济上联系起来，并使他们避免投机商人买贱卖贵的压迫；希望我们要善于和破坏国民经济的投机商斗争。我们这里的农民也相信我们是能够这样做的，因为在我们领导之下，他们已亲身经验根本的利益，并相信我们对人民事业的忠心，相信我们的能力。所有中国的人民都知道中国共产党人是翻天覆地的最能干最了不起的中国人物，都知道我们什么都能够学会，并会学得比别人高明，以至可能高出万倍，只要我们肯学的话。如果中国共产党人是不能干的话，中国也就没有希望了。但是，在我们解放区，不论工人，农民，或其他人民，除了高兴我们已经兑现的东西之外，对于其他还没有兑现的东西，也是期待我们不要拖延时间太久，而是要更快地兑现。当然，我们一些根本的办法是有的。毛泽东同志的著作同样地早已指出了我们在进行土地改革之后，继续解脱农民贫困的道路，可是我们很多地方不会按照毛泽东同志的方针去做，不会具体化，或者做得很粗暴，做得很不切实际，很不耐心，所以就延长了兑现的时间。
    毫无疑问：我们也正在碰到试验，在整个经济战线上（包括工业、农业、商业、金融）的试验，而这个试验将要决定中国新民主主义的政治与经济的命运以及将来由新民主主义走向社会主义的命运。
    毫无疑问：苏联共产党员在列宁与斯大林的指导之下，结果是学得那末出色，做得那末惊天动地，那末，以毛泽东同志为首的我们中国共产党人也就一定不会辜负我们中国人民的期待，凡是苏联共产党员能够做到的，我们便也可能同样做到，而根本的条件，就是：我们中国共产党人要能够象苏联共产党人那样善于学习。
    列宁认为必须三番四复地学习，学了不会又学，学了不会又学，一直要达到目的。
    “我重复说一遍：由于我们有正确政策的结果，我们从人民大众那里获得了信用和延期兑现，用新经济政策的术语来说，这是一种期票，但是在这种期票上没有载着年月日，它们将何时要求兑现，你是不知道的。这就是危险之所在，这就是政治期票和普通的、商业上的期票不同的特点。必须把我们一切的注意力集中在这一点上，而不要以为在一切国营托拉斯及合办公司中有着负责的和优秀的共产党员为满足，那是没有什么用处的，因为这些共产党员不善于作生意，他们远不如在大工厂及大公司中受过训练的那般普通的资本主义店员。我们没有意识到这个事实；再用那同样的伟大的俄罗斯语来说，共产党人的自负心在这里还依然存在着。问题是在于负责的共产党员——虽然是最好的，虽然是非常诚实，忠心耿耿的，虽然他曾经忍受过苦役而不畏死难，但他却不会做买卖，因为他不是一个经营商业的人，他没有学习过怎样做生意，也不愿意学习，也不了解他必须从ＡＢＣ学起。一个共产党员，一个干过世界上最伟大革命的革命家，一个为众目所注视（如果不是为四十个金字塔所注目，则无论如何是为欧洲四十个国家所注目）而抱着从资本主义下面解放出来的希望的人——他应当从一个普通的店员学习起，这个店员有十年的商店经验，他懂得怎样做生意；而负责的共产党员与忠实的革命家，却不仅不知道经营商业，而且甚至他还没有觉悟到他不知道经营商业这回事。”
    “因此，同志们，如果我们能把这种初步的愚昧与无知纠正过来，那末这将是一件巨大的胜利。我们在离开这个大会时，应当确信我们还不懂得这一点，以后应从ＡＢＣ学起。毕竟我们还是革命家（虽然有许多人说——这不是完全没有根据的——我们已经官僚化了），我们能够理解这种简单的事情：即是在一件新的非常困难的工作上，应当善于好几度从头做起；如果在开始以后，你碰壁了，那末你再重新开始，那怕十次改作，直到你达到你的目的为止，不要因为你是一个共产党员而装腔作势，而再自高自大，要知道一个非党的店员，也许是一个白党——我们就确定他是一个白党吧——很善于从事在经济上必不可缺的一些事情，而你却是不会的。如果你是一个负责的共产党员，有着成百的官职头衔，又是共产党和苏维埃的“功臣”，如果你理解这一点，那你一定能达到你的目的，因为这种事情是可以学会的。”
    “虽然在过去一年间（按：指一九二一年），我们有了小小的成绩，但这些成绩是微小不足道的。主要的事情，是一切共产党人还没有这种广泛的认识和觉悟，就是在目前，我们——俄国负责的和最忠诚的共产党员的这种本领，比任何一个旧时的店员都要差些。我再重复地说一遍：我们必须从头学起。如果我们认识了这一点，那末，我们的考试是会合格的了，这一考试是很严重的，这一考试是由日益迫近的财政危机来举行的，是由我们所从属的与之联系而不能分离的俄国的和国际的市场来举行的……这一考试是严格的，因为在这里，人家在经济上和政治上都能击败我们。”（同上）
    显然，列宁告诉了我们：首先我们共产党员要有“广泛的认识和觉悟”（听呵，是广泛的认识呀，是广泛的觉悟呀），知道了在这经济工作方面我们比别人不行，而后我们才会去认真地学习，而后我们的考试才会合格。
    因为社会主义与私人资本的“竞争是非常地激烈的”，社会主义必须能够经得起一分痛苦的财政危机的考试，经得起内外市场的考试；当时列宁是这末警告的：“这一考试是严格的，因为在这里，人家在经济上和政治上都能击败我们。”
    列宁指出了管理事业的技能与文化程度是相关联的：
    “这里，须要明白地提出问题：我们的力量究竟在哪里？我们缺少些什么东西？政治的权力是十分足够的。这里未必有人会说，共产党人，共产党，在某一个实际问题上，在某一个事务机关当中，是缺少权力的。基本的经济力量是在我们的手中，一切带有决定意义的大企业、铁路等等，都在我们手里。……缺乏什么东西，这是一目了然的：现在感到缺乏的，是管理国事的那部分共产党员的文化程度。如果以莫斯科为例——它有负责的共产党员四千七百人——如果我们拿这个庞大的官僚机构为例，那末我们就要问一问：究竟谁在领导着谁呢？我非常怀疑是否能够说：那些共产党员是在领导着这个巨大的机构。老实说一句，并不是他们在领导着人家，而是人家领导着他们。这里发生的事情，正如同童年时代人家讲给我们的历史故事，人家教我们说，有一个时候，一个民族征服了另一个民族，战胜的民族成了征服者，而被征服的民族则成了战败者。这是很简单明了的。但是这些民族的文化如何呢？在这里，事情就不大简单了。如果战胜的民族，其文化高于战败民族，则前者迫使后者接受其文化；在相反的场合，则战败的民族迫使战胜的民族接受其文化。（按：在我们中国历史上，发生过这样的事情，就是：战败的汉族结果迫使战胜的契丹、女墒、蒙古与满洲诸族接受汉族的文化）在俄罗斯社会主义联邦苏维埃共和国的首都，是不是也发生了这同样的事情呢？这四千七百个共产党员（这已近于一师的人数，并且他们全体又是最优秀的），是不是也服从了他人的文化呢？是的，在这里人们可能得到这样的印象，以为在这种场合之下，战败者有着高度的文化。但实际的情形，决不是如此的。他们的文化是很可怜的渺小的。但是它比较我们的文化还是要高些。不论它如何的可怜与贫弱，然而它比我们负责的共产党员的文化水准总要高些，因为这些共产党员缺少管理事业的才能。共产党员在领导某一机关时——有时，怠工者们故意巧妙地迎合他们，以便利用他们作为掩护物——常常被人欺骗和愚弄。承认这个事实，自然是一件很不愉快的事情，或者至少是一件不大愉快的事情；然而我认为这一点是必须加以承认的，因为在现时，这正是问题的焦点所在。……”
    “苏联与俄国共产党员的负责的共产党员，他们是否会理解到他们是不会管理呢？他们是否觉察到，他们自以为是领导人家，而事实上他们是在被人家领导呢？如果他们觉悟到这一点，那末他们自然就能够学习，因为这是能够学习到的。为了这，是应当学习的；但是我们的同志却并不学习。我们的同志到处发命令出布告，然而结果却与他们所想望的相去甚远。”（同上）
    在革命胜利的初期，我们是没有法子不承认我们的文化是比较别人要低些，在我们中国，这事实是同样明显的。虽然在我们这里，地主阶级也罢，资产阶级也罢，它们的文化程度，是更加可怜，更加渺小，但是还是象列宁所说的一样：“它比我们的文化还是要高些，不论它如何的可怜与贫弱，然而它比我们负责的共产党工作人员的文化水准总要高些，因为我们缺少管理事业的技能”。这样，我们是不可能依靠发命令出布告来解决问题的，我们必需而且也只能依靠学习来解决问题。在这里，骄傲就会是愚蠢以至灭亡。
    一九二一年四月间，列宁“论粮食税”即已指出：
    “不要害怕共产党员去向资产阶级专门家‘学习’，其中也向商人，也向小的合作社资本家，也向资本家‘学习’。向他们学习应按另一种形式，但实质上是与我们曾向军事专家学习并学会了的一样。‘学习’的结果，只有靠实际经验来检查：要做得比旁边资产阶级专门家所做的好一些，要能够用各种办法振兴农业、振兴工业，使农业与工业间的周转发达起来。为了‘领教’要不惜破费：多花点钱去学习，决不可惜，只要能受到教益。”写这些话过了约近一年，列宁又说：
    “如果共产党人能够用他人的手来建设经济，而自己则向这资产阶级学习，并使资产阶级走上利于我们所要走的道路时，那我们便能管理这种经济了。但是，如果一个共产党员自以为我既是负责的共产党员，我什么都懂，我所战胜的人要比店员高明得多，我们在前面厮杀过，并且还不是同这样的人厮杀哩，——正是这种占优势的情绪在戕害我们。”（同上引在联共十一次代表大会上的报告）
    因此，列宁指出了要善于与共党人员合作：
    “……务须办到这一步，即：使那些与我们合作并在数量上远超过我们好多倍的大批分子，能够这样来进行工作，以便我们能善于监督和管理他们的工作，我们能理解这种工作，能用他们的手作出对共产主义有益的事情来。目前形势的中心关键就在这里，因为虽然有个别的共产党员已经理解了和看到了这一点，但是，我党的广大群众对吸引非党人员参加工作一点之必要，还没有认识。……”
    完全可以明白：列宁当时的这些意见是适用于现在的我们的。
    我们要善于学习，要学习使自己会建设经济；要学习在公营企业中，在合作社企业中，一方面，善于与非党的专门家合作，善于向他们学习技能，另一方面，则又须善于和暗害的特务分子、破坏分子及怠工者作斗争；要学习在建设整个新民主主义社会经济的事业中，一方面，善于与那些拥护新民主主义政权、经营正当营业而能够并有能力组织生产的“文明的资本家”实行经济的联盟与经济的共处，另方面，则又须善于与那些经营投机事业而破坏国民经济建设的“不文明的资本家”作斗争。而在这一学习过程中，我们是必须尽量发挥各地方各部门的创造积极性的。正如列宁“论粮食税”的结论上所说过的：“在振兴农业与工业的周转中，无论如何要在各方面极力发展地方的主动性，首创性和独立精神。研究这方面的实际经验。这种经验尽可能要是各式各样的。”
    如果有人摆起官僚架子，表现官僚习气，既不善于学习这样，也不善于学习那样，而办起事来一塌糊涂，那就该怎样办呢？列宁主张把他交给法庭，加以审判，和禁闭。列宁指出：绝大多数的共产党员是好的，可是不善于处理实际工作，因循苟安，乱杂无章，胡粗乱撞。列宁说：
    “在我们的斗争中，我们必须记牢：共产党员是需要深思熟虑的。他们可以很漂亮地告诉你关于革命斗争，关于全世界斗争状况的事情。但是，为了打破绝望的贫困与穷乏，则须要成为一个深思熟虑、有养教、有条有理的人；可是他们不会这些。如果我们对负责的共产党员加以指责，说他们作事不诚实，那是不对的。他们当中的绝大多数——百分之九十九可说不仅是诚实之人，而且证明了他们在沙皇制度颠覆以前以及革命之后的最困难的条件下面，都是忠于革命的人，可以说他们都是供献了他们生命的人。因此，要想在这方面找出事业的原委来，那在根本上是错误的。我们所需要的，乃是对于最单纯的国家事务之文化的处置。我们必须理对，这种事务是国家的事务，是商业上的事务；如果有何种障碍的话，就应当善于克服这些障碍，将那些犯有官僚习气的人交给法庭。我想无产阶级的法庭是善于惩办的，然而为了惩办起见，那就应当找到犯罪的人。我可以向你们担保，在这一次的事件（按：列宁指当时一个向外国购买食品的事件）当中，是不会找到犯罪的人的，请你们都仔细考察一下，就可知道犯罪的人是没有的，而所有的，只是各式各种无谓纷扰、奔忙与无意识的事情而已。……没有一个人是善于处理事情的；没有一个人懂得对于国家的事务是应当这样来处理，而不应当那样来处理。一切白党及怠工者，都恰恰利用了这一个弱点。”
    列宁所责备的那种从事“各式各种无谓纷扰、奔忙与无意识的事情”的人，也就是我们这里平常所指的爬行的经验本义者与繁琐的事务主义者。在我们解放区，同样地是如列宁所指出的：“问题的要点不在于握有政治权力，而在于善于管理经营，善于适当地布置人员，善于避免小的磨擦，以便国家经济不要终断。”但是，有什么方法可以使这种经验主义者与事务主义者变成“一个深思熟虑、有教养、有条有理的人”呢？除了善于学习又学习，以便提高自己管理事业的技能，提高自己的文化，还有什么别的方法可以使得我们善于处理事情，善于管理经营，善于适当地布置人员，并使我们经营和管理的事业能够迅速地赶过别人与竞争过别人呢？

    列宁在一九二二年四月间对于苏联共产党工作所作的结论，现在同样地变成我们今天在中国解放区从事建设工作的结论。列宁说：“现在，全部关键在于，先锋队不要害怕教育自己、改造自己，公开承认自己没有充分准备和没有充分本领等等。全部关键就在于现在要协同更无限广泛和无限强大的群众前进，务必协同农民一起前进，用事实、实践和经验证明给农民看，我们是在学习，并要学习来帮助他们，领导他们前进。在俄国目前的国际形势下，在俄国目前的生产力状况下，只有极缓慢地，极小心地，脚踏实地，千百次实际检查自己的每一步骤，才能解决这个任务。”（在俄国共产党（布）第十一次代表大会闭幕时的演说）
    这结论也就是毛泽东同志在一九四五年一月的陕甘宁劳动英雄和模范工作者大会上所作的演讲的最后两句话：
    “中国靠我们来建设，我们必须努力学习。”（两三年内完全学会经济工作）
