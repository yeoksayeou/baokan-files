Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 30th: The Inner Mongolia Trade Administration Bureau recently convened the second conference of league, banner (county), and city trade bureau directors to discuss sideline production issues in detail. The conference decided that the main principles for developing sideline production in the future should be based on the needs of military industry, industry, and commerce, as well as the necessities of the people. The Trade Administration Bureau also decided to allocate 5 billion yuan from its operating funds to promote sideline production. The area is rich in salt, alkali, fur, mountain products, and the like, which is extremely beneficial for developing sideline production. In Xing'an League this year, thanks to the Inner Mongolia Trade Administration Bureau's loan of salt capital to Dabulan Nuoer Salt Lake for salt extraction, by the end of September, there were 9,000 ox carts hauling 4.5 million catties of salt. In total, with 1 billion yuan of salt capital, a profit of 9 billion yuan was made, which could buy 22,500 shi of corn, equivalent to the annual output of 9,000 qing of land (calculated at 2.5 dou per qing). Last year, 100,200 grey squirrel pelts and marmots were shipped out of Hulunbuir, along with six other types of fur, which could be exchanged for more than 2,400 bolts of cloth.

　　内蒙贸易会议讨论发展副业
    【新华社东北三十日电】内蒙贸易管理总局于日前召集第二次盟旗（县）市贸易局长会议，详细讨论副业生产问题。会议决定今后发展副业主要以军工、工商业需要及人民必需品等为原则。贸易总局并决定在营业资金中抽出五十亿元，推动副业生产。该区盛产盐、碱、皮毛、山货等，对发展副业生产极为有利。兴安盟今年经内蒙贸易管理总局借给盐本到达布兰诺尔盐池拉盐的，到九月底止，即有九千辆牛车，拉盐四百五十万斤。总计以十亿盐本，获利九十亿元，可买苞米二万二千五百石，等于九千垧地全年产量（每垧以二石五斗计）。去年呼伦贝尔运出之灰鼠元皮、旱獭等十万零二千余张，连其他六种皮毛，共计约可换布二千四百多匹。
