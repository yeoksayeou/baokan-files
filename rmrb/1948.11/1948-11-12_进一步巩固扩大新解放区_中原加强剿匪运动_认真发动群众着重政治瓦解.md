Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 2nd. Our Central Plains General Branch reporter recently commented under the title "Implement Bandit Suppression and Stabilize People's Livelihood," stating that the Central Plains should seize the current favorable opportunity to continue to develop and strengthen the mass bandit suppression movement, with the aim of eradicating banditry, stabilizing people's livelihood, and further consolidating and expanding the Central Plains Liberated Area, as one of the important tasks in the region currently. The commentary pointed out:

The Kuomintang reactionaries, local bullies and evil gentry, and bandits are a trinity, colluding with each other and acting as partners in crime. They are the three big stones weighing on the people of the Central Plains. Local bullies and evil gentry are the agents of the US imperialists and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group in ruling, oppressing, exploiting, and trampling on the people. The bandits are tools planned, manufactured, and fostered by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group and local bullies and evil gentry to suppress the people and maintain their reactionary rule. The bandit leader Bai Chongxi, in reviewing the military failures in Central China, once again proposed to strengthen the breeding of local bandit armed forces. This proves that the more they fail, the more they attempt to buy and manufacture large numbers of bandit armed forces to harm the people and carry out a desperate death struggle. Therefore, eliminating bandits, eradicating violence, and overthrowing the rule of the Kuomintang, local bullies, and evil gentry are the most common and urgent calls of the people of the Central Plains. It is also the necessary process for us to mobilize the masses, unite people from all walks of life, and carry out various construction tasks in the base areas. Currently, the People's Liberation Army is victoriously conducting the autumn offensive on various battlefields, and the Kuomintang bandit gang and the bandits they foster are even more shaken, panicked, and divided. This is the best time to win over, disintegrate, and eliminate bandits. To achieve this goal, the following three principles must be implemented in the bandit suppression work:

First, earnestly mobilize the masses and develop a broad mass movement, instead of limiting bandit suppression to isolated and purely military activities, in order to achieve the practical results of eradicating bandits and stabilizing people's livelihood. The people in the Central Plains region have a tradition and experience in preventing bandits and defending themselves. The government and the army must grasp the most realistic and urgent demands of the local people at that time, and inspire and develop the people's enthusiasm and experience in bandit suppression and protecting their homes, mobilizing all social forces to form a broad bandit suppression movement.

Second, in the bandit suppression struggle, we must grasp the principle of combining suppression and pacification, and implement the policy of political disintegration as the main method and military strike as the auxiliary method. Militarily, we must be active, bold, and brave in attacking, resolutely and tenaciously fight, not be afraid of fatigue, not be afraid of missing targets, fight fiercely and pursue relentlessly, and act continuously, so that the bandits cannot get a chance to breathe. First of all, concentrate forces to attack the bandits who have done the most evil and are hated by everyone. For scattered bandits, we must continue to search and suppress them in conjunction with the government and the people, and strive to eradicate them completely, so as not to allow them to revive. At the same time, there must be unified command and coordinated action between districts, counties, and sub-districts to eliminate large and small gaps. At the same time, we must launch a political offensive, issue proclamations to reassure the people, hold various meetings, and use various propaganda tools and methods to widely explain the current situation, the propositions and policies of our party, our army, and the democratic government, especially the handling methods for bandits and puppet personnel. Make everyone understand the right and wrong, the pros and cons, and actively participate in the bandit suppression struggle. At the same time, hold symposiums for the families of bandits, openly release coerced members and suppress bandit leaders, inspire self-renewal members to repent and complain, and strive to disintegrate bandits outside and fugitives through all relations, isolating the most evil bandit leaders.

Third, in dealing with bandits, we must implement Chairman Mao's correct principle of "punishing the ringleaders severely, not questioning the coerced, and rewarding those who perform meritorious service." Bandit leaders who are guilty of heinous crimes and are stubbornly unrepentant must be resolutely suppressed and given the punishment they deserve, in order to uphold the law and discipline and encourage the courage and determination of the masses in the bandit suppression struggle; however, the majority of bandits are forced to join due to livelihood or other reasons. Although they have also done bad things, most of them are not intentional. For these coerced members, we should explain the great righteousness and the pros and cons, and call on them to abandon evil and return to good, and return home to live and work in peace. The democratic government will not investigate the past. Those who return with weapons, kill bandit leaders, secretly report bandit information, or help the government collect bandit firearms will be allowed to atone for their crimes and will be given the rewards they deserve, protecting them from retaliation and persecution by bandits. As long as we correctly implement the above policies, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort and finally eliminate the banditry in the Central Plains.

　　进一步巩固扩大新解放区
  　中原加强剿匪运动
    认真发动群众着重政治瓦解
    【新华社中原二日电】中原总分社记者顷以“贯彻剿匪安定民生”为题，评述中原应争取目前有利时机，继续开展和加强群众性的剿匪运动，以期根绝匪患，安定民生，进一步巩固和扩大中原解放区，为该区当前重要任务之一。评论中指出：
    国民党反动派，土劣恶霸和土匪，三位一体，狼狈为奸，是压在中原人民身上的三块大石头，土劣恶霸是美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石反动集团统治、压迫、剥削蹂躏人民的代理人，而土匪则是蒋介石反动集团和土劣恶霸有计划地制造和豢养，用以镇压人民，维持其反动统治的工具。匪首白崇禧在检讨华中军事失败之一，再一次提出要加强繁殖地方土匪武装。由此证明他们越是失败，越是妄图大量收买和制造土匪武装，扰害人民，进行绝望性的垂死挣扎。因此，肃清土匪、除暴安良、推翻国民党土劣和恶霸的统治，是当前中原人民最普遍而又最迫切的呼声。也是我们当前发动群众、团结各阶层人民、进行根据地各种建设工作的必经过程。而目前各战场解放军胜利进行秋季攻势，国民党匪帮内部及其豢养之土匪更加动摇、惊惶、分裂，这正是争取、瓦解和消灭土匪的最好时机。为达此目的必须在剿匪工作中贯彻下列三个原则：
    第一，认真发动群众，开展成为广大的群众性运动，而不应把剿匪局限于孤立的单纯的军事活动，才能收根绝土匪、安定民生的实效。而我中原地区人民，向有防匪自卫的传统和经验。政府和军队必须把握解决当时当地人民这一最现实最迫切之要求，并启发、发挥人民剿匪保乡的热情和经验，动员一切社会力量，形成广泛的剿匪运动。
    第二，剿匪斗争中必须掌握剿抚兼施的原则，贯彻以政治瓦解为主，军事打击为辅的方针。军事上，必须积极活动，大胆勇敢的扑击，坚决顽强的斗争，不怕疲劳，不怕扑空，猛打穷追，连续行动，使土匪不能得到喘息机会。首先集中力量，打击作恶最多，人人痛恨的股匪，对于散匪就要结合政府和人民力量继续搜剿，务期斩草除根，不使死灰复燃，同时区与区间，县与县间，分区与分区间，必须统一指挥，协同动作，消灭大大小小的空隙地带。同时，必须开展政治攻势，布告安民，召开各种集会，利用各种宣传工具和各种宣传方法，广泛说明目前形势、我党我军和民主政府的主张政策，尤其是对土匪和伪方人员的处理办法。使大家明辨是非利害，踊跃参加剿匪斗争。同时，召开土匪家属座谈会，公开释放胁从分子和镇压匪首，启发自新分子悔过、诉苦，通过一切关系，争取瓦解在外土匪和逃亡分子，孤立万恶匪首。
    第三，处理土匪中必须贯彻毛主席的“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”的正确原则。罪大恶极冥顽不法的匪首，必须坚决镇压，给以应得之罪，以振法纪，鼓舞群众剿匪斗争的勇气和决心；但土匪的大多数分子，均系为生活所迫，或其他种种关系被迫参加，虽也作了坏事，但大多非出本心，对这些胁从分子，应该晓以大义，明以利害，号召其改邪归正，回家安居乐业，民主政府一律不究既往。对那些携械来归，或击杀匪首，或密报匪情，或帮助政府收缴土匪枪支的有功分子，政府应允其将功赎罪，并予以应得之奖励，保护他们不受土匪的报复和迫害。只要我们正确执行上述政策，就可以事半功倍，最后肃清中原的匪患。
