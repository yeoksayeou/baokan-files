　　Due to the desperate military situation, the Kuomintang reactionaries are requesting direct military protection from US imperialism. Although the US government pretends to be indifferent on the surface, US Secretary of Defense Forrestal announced the dispatch of one thousand Marines to China, the US 38th Special Mixed Fleet continues to remain off the Chinese coast, and US Commander of the Western Pacific Fleet Badger threatened that the US Marines might enter Shanghai "as a protective measure." In response, the CCP Central Committee issued an important statement on the 21st, expressing resolute opposition to the traitorous behavior of the Kuomintang reactionary government and the aggressive activities of US imperialism. In this statement, the CCP Central Committee announced the solemn stance of the Chinese people on diplomatic issues: The Chinese people "are willing to establish equal and friendly relations with all foreign countries, including the United States, and protect the legitimate interests of all foreign nationals in China, including American nationals; however, it is imperative to maintain the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, free from any infringement. We will resolutely and thoroughly oppose anyone who violates this solemn stance." As the Chinese People's Liberation War increasingly approaches national victory, and as some American adventurers are colluding with the Kuomintang reactionaries, attempting to "fish in troubled waters," this statement will undoubtedly be warmly supported by all patriotic elements in the country. Internationally, all those who are willing to cooperate with the Chinese nation on an equal footing will agree with the views in the CCP Central Committee's statement, while those who harbor aggressive conspiracies against China's territorial sovereignty should be warned by it.
　　The main development of the People's Liberation War in the past week remains in the Xuzhou area. Here, the People's Liberation Army completed the annihilation of Huang Baitao's army corps of five armies and ten divisions, thereby victoriously concluding the first stage of the Huaihai Campaign. In this stage, the Kuomintang army has lost eighteen regular divisions. In addition to Huang's ten divisions, the other eight divisions are Feng Zhi'an's two armies and four divisions (of which more than three divisions revolted under the leadership of Generals He Jifeng and Zhang Kexia, and the remaining remnants were annihilated by the People's Liberation Army), Liu Ruming's one division, Sun Liangcheng's one army and two divisions, and the one division of the 25th Army annihilated in Suxian on the 16th. The Kuomintang army's regular forces used in the Xuzhou-Bengbu area were originally fifty divisions at the beginning of the Huaihai Campaign; with the addition of Huang Wei's army corps of eleven divisions transferred from southern Henan, and the 39th Army of two divisions and the 54th Army of three divisions withdrawn from Huludao and incorporated into Li Yannian's army corps, there were a total of sixty-six divisions. The loss of eighteen divisions in this total, especially the annihilation of Huang Baitao's army corps, is a heavy blow to the Chiang bandits in the Xu-Beng area. On other battlefields, the Northwest People's Liberation Army annihilated two regiments of the 144th Division in ＠Yang, Shaanxi, on the 15th, and annihilated the 17th Division in the Pucheng, Fuping, and Yaoxian areas on the 22nd. The North China People's Liberation Army liberated Baoding, the capital of Hebei Province, on the 22nd, and the defending enemy fled north. The Northeast People's Liberation Army is currently in the midst of reorganization.
　　Nationalist "Currency Reform" Declared a Complete Failure; Masses Universally Resist Chiang Bandits' Frenzied Plunder
　　The economic situation, which is as critical as the military situation, forced the Kuomintang government to cancel the "price limit" on the first of this month, "revise" the issuance method of the Gold Yuan Notes and the handling method of gold, silver, and foreign currencies on the 8th, and the Central Bank of the Kuomintang issued the "Deposit Cashing General Rules" on the 19th. The so-called "currency system reform" declared by the Kuomintang bandits as "only success, no failure" has thus been declared a complete failure by themselves. In the Kuomintang bandits' "revised" method on the 8th, the pseudo-Gold Yuan Notes were devalued by 80%, but in reality, it has depreciated even lower than that. They wanted to use the slim hope of issuing so-called Gold Yuan and exchanging gold and silver yuan to save people's confidence in the pseudo-Gold Yuan Notes. However, the exchange is not only limited to those who have deposited in designated banks for more than one year, but even these people, except for a few privileged elements who are qualified to conduct financial speculation, will never be able to carry out the exchange without restriction. In short, people know a simple common sense: since the Kuomintang bandits have no way to maintain the credit of the pseudo-Legal Tender, of course, they have no way to maintain the credit of the pseudo-Gold Yuan Notes; since they have no way even under "emergency measures," of course, they have no way after the collapse of the "emergency measures." The Kuomintang's "revised" method canceled the provision that the so-called "issuance amount of Gold Yuan Notes is limited to 2 billion yuan." According to statistics at the end of October, the average monthly issuance of Gold Yuan Notes was 700 million, which is equal to fourteen times the currency issuance amount (150 trillion Legal Tender, equivalent to 50 million Gold Yuan Notes) in July before the so-called "currency reform." This frenzied expansion will of course be more rapid after the superficial restrictions on issuance are lifted. This frenzied plunder has caused widespread mass resistance. Although under the cruel oppression of the Kuomintang, strike movements in various places are still expanding. 12,000 railway workers in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, employees of the British-owned Water Works, the British-owned Tram Company, the British-owned Gas Company, and the French-owned Tram Company in Shanghai, employees of the Jianghai Customs, film technicians, workers of silk factories and textile factories, etc., have all held strikes successively this month, or are still continuing to strike. The strike movement of teachers has spread to Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Qingdao, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Chengdu, Kunming and other places. On the 19th of this month, the number of primary school teachers on strike in Shanghai alone reached more than 5,000. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 蒋匪军事绝望要求美帝保护　中共庄严声明维护国土主权

　　蒋匪军事绝望要求美帝保护
  　中共庄严声明维护国土主权
    由于军事形势已经绝望，国民党反动派正要求美帝国主义给予直接军事保护。尽管美国政府在表面上装作冷淡，美国国防部福莱斯特尔却宣布派一千海军陆战队来华，美国的第三十八特种混合舰队继续留在中国海岸，而美国西太平洋舰队司令白吉尔则扬言美国海军陆战队可能“作为保护措施”进入上海。中共中央为此于二十一日发表重要声明，对于国民党反动政府的叛国行为和美帝国主义的侵略活动表示坚决的反对。中共中央在这个声明中宣布了中国人民在外交问题上的庄严立场：中国人民“愿兴一切外国包括美国在内建立平等的友好的关系，并保护一切外国在华侨民包括美国侨民在内的正当利益；但是必须保持中国领土主权之完整，不受任何侵犯。凡与此庄严立场相违反者，我们将坚决地彻底地反对到底。”当中国人民解放战争日益接近全国胜利的时候，当美国某些冒险家正在和国民党反动派狼狈为奸，企图“混水摸鱼”的时候，这个声明无疑将获得全国一切爱国分子的热诚拥护。在国际间，凡是愿与中国民族平等合作的人们都将同意中共中央声明中的观点，而对中国领土主权怀抱侵略阴谋的人们则应当由此得到警告。
    人民解放战争在过去一周中的主要发展，仍然是在徐州方面。在这里，人民解放军完成了对于黄伯韬兵团五个军十个师的歼灭，从而胜利地结束了淮海战役的第一个阶段。在这一个阶段中，国民党军已丧失十八个正规师。除黄兵团十个师外，其他八个师是冯治安部两个军四个师（其中三个多师在何基沣、张克侠两将军领导下起义，其余残部被解放军残灭），刘汝明部一个师，孙良诚部一个军两个师，和十六日在宿县被歼的二十五军之一个师。国民党军用于徐州蚌埠地区的正规兵力，在淮海战役开始时原为五十个师；加进了从豫南调来的黄维兵团十一个师，和从葫芦岛撤退编入李延年兵团的三十九军两个师，五十四军三个师，共为六十六个师。在这个总数里丧失十八个师，即丧失其四分之一以上。这十八个师的消灭，特别是黄伯韬兵团的消灭，对于徐、蚌地区的蒋匪是一个沉重的打击。在其他战场方面，西北人民解放军于十五日在陕中＠阳歼敌一四四师两个团，又于二十二日在蒲城、富平、耀县地区歼敌十七师。华北人民解放军在二十二日解放河北省会保定，守敌北逃。东北人民解放军正在休整中。
    国民党“币改”宣告完全失败　群众普遍反抗蒋匪疯狂掠夺
    与军事情势同样危急的经济情势，迫使国民党政府在本月一日取消了“限价”，八日“修正”了金圆券发行办法和金银外币处理办法，十九日国民党中央银行颁布了“存款兑现通则”。国民党匪帮所宣布为“只许成功，不许失败”的所谓“改革币制”，由此自己宣布了完全的失败。国民党匪帮八日的“修正”办法中，伪金圆券贬值百分之八十，而实际上已比这贬得更低。他们想用所谓发行金圆和兑换黄金银圆的渺茫希望来挽救人们对于伪金圆券的信用。但是兑换不仅限于在指定银行存款满一年者，而且即令这些人，除了有资格进行金融投机的少数特权分子以外，也决不可能无限制地实行兑换。总之，人们知道一个简单的常识：国民党匪帮既然没有办法维持伪法币的信用，当然也没有办法维持伪金圆券的信用；既然在“紧急措施”下尚且没有办法，在“紧急措施”垮台以后当然更加没有办法。国民党的“修正”办法中取消了所谓“金圆券发行数额以二十亿元为限”的规定。据十月底统计，金圆券每月平均发行七亿，等于所谓“币改”前的七月份货币发行额（法币一百五十万亿，合金圆券五千万）的十四倍。这种疯狂的膨胀，在取消了发行的表面限制以后，当然会更加迅速。这种疯狂的掠夺已经造成普遍的群众反抗。虽然在国民党的残酷压迫之下，各地罢工运动仍趋扩大。南京、上海、杭州一万二千铁路工人，上海英商自来水厂，英商电车公司，英商煤气公司及法商电车公司之职工，江海关员工，电影业技工，丝厂与纺织厂工人等，均于本月先后举行过罢工，或仍继续罢工。教职员之罢教运动普及于北平、天津、唐山、青岛、上海、南京、汉口、成都、昆明等地。本月十九日上海一地罢教之小学教师即达五千余人。　　（新华社）
