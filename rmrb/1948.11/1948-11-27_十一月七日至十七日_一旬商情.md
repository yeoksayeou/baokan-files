　　A Ten-Day Market Report

    Hua Bei Mao Zong Shang Qing Ke

    In the past ten days, commodity prices in various liberated areas both inside and outside our North China region have generally been stable. Cotton cloth in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Southern Hebei, and Bohai regions has shifted from an active price increase in the previous ten days to a stable decline, but Hebei Central and Taiyue still show active increases. Grain is generally stable, but wheat stands out in price due to the increasing number of cities in the liberated areas and the wide demand for flour-based foods. Oil and salt prices remain stable or falling due to abundant supplies. Imported paper and matches are still rising. Locally produced flour and yarn are stable. Specific conditions for various commodities in different regions are reported below:

    Grain and Flour

    Grain prices in Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Southern Hebei have fallen back. In Hebei Central, prices are still rising due to the impact of rising prices in border areas and grain shortages in flood-affected areas. Other regions are stable with slight fluctuations.

In Taihangtai, wheat prices rose sharply, rising by 34% from the 1st to the 7th, and gradually falling back after the 12th.
