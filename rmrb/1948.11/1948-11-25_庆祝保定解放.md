　　Celebrating the Liberation of Baoding
Our army liberated Baoding, the strategic key point of the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway and the capital of Hebei Province, on the 22nd. From then on, the "three-point" formation of Pingjin-Bao constructed by the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs in North China has disintegrated. This will make Peiping and Tianjin, besieged by the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs, even more exposed, and the North China People's Liberation Army will gain a more favorable position to advance towards Peiping and Tianjin. The liberation of Baoding is a great victory in the autumn offensive of the People's Liberation Army. Following the liberation of famous cities such as Jinan, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Jinzhou, Changchun, and Shenyang, it is another major city in North China that has been recovered. It is also a major victory for our North China People's Liberation Army after crushing the plot of the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit army to raid Shijiazhuang. Now, not only is the people's Shijiazhuang even more impregnable, but Baoding will also belong to the people forever.
    Since the liberation of Shijiazhuang last year, Baoding has become the most prominent stronghold of the bandit army in North China extending southward from Peiping. In January of this year, the Baobei Campaign cut off the railway traffic between Baoding and Peiping. In July, the annihilation of the 31st Division of the New 2nd Army in Dingxing and Xushui resulted in our control of the section from Caohe north to Beihedian, and Baoding became isolated. After the Chiang and Fu bandit army's plan to raid Shijiazhuang at the end of October was crushed, the 101st Army Headquarters and the 273rd Division stationed in Baoding, along with the 16th Army of the 94th Army, retreated north to Zhuozhou. The 272nd Division and the Jibao 36th Regiment, which remained in Baoding, were annihilated with more than 1,500 casualties in our battle to attack the city of Baoding from November 14th to 16th. Fu Zuoyi then hurriedly dispatched a total of six divisions, including the 16th Army of the 35th Army and the 101st Army of the 94th Army, to the Xushui Caohe area to meet the 272nd Division fleeing north. On the enemy's retreat north, our army tracked and attacked them to near Xushui, killing and capturing some of the enemy. The enemy in Baoding fled in such a disarray.
    Baoding is the gateway to Pingjin and one of the military, political, and cultural centers of North China. The liberation of Baoding is undoubtedly a severe blow to the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs.
    The Chiang bandits, who are at the end of their rope, have recently been deceiving themselves and others by singing about "not caring about the gains and losses of one city or one place." In the first year of the People's Liberation War, the People's Liberation Army withdrew from several cities and shifted to a mobile position relying on the vast countryside, annihilating millions of Chiang bandit troops. In the second year of the war, it turned from strategic defense to strategic offense, and even transformed the situation from a military numerical disadvantage to a complete advantage. Today, the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs have no rural support after losing cities, and they will completely collapse with the loss of cities. This is certain, and the people of the whole country can see it clearly.
    When the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit troops trapped in Pingjin and along the Peiping-Liaoning Railway are completely exposed to the iron fist of our North China People's Liberation Army after the liberation of Baoding, the powerful Northeast People's Liberation Army, which shocks the world, will be pouring into the pass in a steady stream. The Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit troops are trapped in the encirclement of the two People's Liberation Armies in the Northeast and North China. This is the desperate situation of the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit troops in the desperate cry of the entire Kuomintang's sinful rule. The liberation of Pingjin is just around the corner. In the midst of celebrating the victory of the liberation of Baoding, the entire military and civilians in North China should work a hundred times harder to prepare for the victory of welcoming the liberation of Pingjin, completely eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit troops on the northern front, and liberating the entire North China! Brave soldiers at the front! Hold high your banners of victory, raise your spears and march north towards Pingjin, and plant this banner of victory on the city walls of Peiping and Tianjin. People from all walks of life in the rear! As the final victory is approaching, mobilize all manpower, material resources, and financial resources to actively support the front. In designated areas for conscription mobilization, enthusiastically respond to the call and complete the conscription task. All the people in the rear must work hard in production and work. The people in the rear must also show the heroic spirit of the soldiers at the front and fulfill our sacred responsibility of welcoming the final victory.

### 庆祝保定解放

　　庆祝保定解放
    我军于廿二日解放平汉北段战略要点河北省会保定。从此蒋傅匪帮在华北以平津保三点所构成的犄角之势已告解体，这将使蒋傅匪帮所困守的北平天津更加暴露，而华北人民解放军则取得了向平津前进更为有利的阵地。保定的解放，是人民解放军秋季攻势伟大胜利中，在解放济南、开封、郑州、锦州、长春、沈阳等名城之后，又收复华北一大名城，是我华北解放军粉碎了蒋傅匪军偷袭石家庄的阴谋之后所获得的重大胜利。现在，不独人民的石家庄更加安如磐石，保定亦永远为人民所有了。
    自去年石家庄解放后，保定即成为华北匪军由北平向南伸出的最突出的据点。今年一月保北战役斩断了保定与北平的铁路交通。七月新二军暂三十一师于定兴徐水的被歼，漕河以北至北河店段即为我控制，保定遂陷孤立。十月末蒋传匪军向石家庄的偷袭计划被粉碎后，驻保定之一○一军部及二七三师就与九十四军十六军北退涿县，留在保定的二七二师及冀保三十六团，在我十一月十四日至十六日攻击保定城关的战斗中被歼一千五百余人，傅匪又慌忙的调三十五军十六军及九十四军一○一军等部共六个师兵力出至徐水漕河地区接应二七二师北逃，在敌北逃途中复遭我军跟踪尾击至徐水附近毙俘敌一部。保定的敌人就是在这样的景况下狼狈逃窜的。
    保定是平津门户，是华北军事、政治、文化中心之一，保定的解放，无疑的，对于蒋傅匪帮是一严重的打击。
    日暮途穷的蒋匪近来竟欺人自欺的也唱起什么“不在一城一地的得失”了。人民解放军在解放战争的第一个年头曾经退出了若干的城市，转入了有广大农村为依托的机动地位，歼灭了成百万的蒋匪军，在战争的第二年即由战略防御转入战略进攻，以至由军事数量上劣势转为全部优势的形势。今天蒋傅匪帮丧失了城市以后是没有农村依托的，它们将随着城市的丧失而全部崩溃。这是确定了的，全国人民都可以看得明明白白的。
    当困守平津和北宁路沿线的蒋傅匪军，在保定解放之后，完全暴露在我华北解放军铁拳打击之下的时候，威震世界的强大的东北解放军正将源源入关。蒋傅匪军陷落在我东北、华北两支解放大军的包围之中。这就是蒋傅匪军在整个国民党罪恶统治绝望声中所处的绝望形势。平津的解放已指日可期了。我华北全体军民在庆祝保定解放的胜利声中，应当更百倍的努力，为准备迎接解放平津、完全消灭北线蒋傅匪军、解放全华北的胜利而奋斗！前方英勇的将士们！高举你们胜利的旗帜，挥戈北上，向平津进军，把这个胜利旗帜，插到北平天津的城头上去。后方的各界人民！最后胜利日益迫近了，动员一切人力物力财力积极支援前线，在进行参军动员的指定地区，热烈响应号召，完成参军的任务。一切后方人民，都要努力生产、工作。后方的人民也要拿出前方将士们那种英勇精神，完成我们迎接最后胜利的神圣责任。
