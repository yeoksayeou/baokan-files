　　Stalin made an extremely important statement on October 28 to a correspondent of Pravda regarding the Berlin situation. Stalin clearly pointed out that the current policy of the U.S., British, and French ruling blocs is a policy of aggression, a policy of launching a new war. What they want is not agreement and cooperation with the Soviet Union, but to talk about agreement and cooperation while repeatedly obstructing and undermining it, thereby "proving" that cooperation with the Soviet Union is impossible and "proving" the necessity of launching a new war. Stalin also clearly pointed out that the result of this policy can only be the shameful failure of the instigators of a new war. The power of the masses of people around the world who advocate peace and demand the elimination of the danger of a new war is so strong that the instigators of a new war cannot overcome this force. Stalin's statement struck the hearts of hundreds of millions of people who yearn for peace and demand the elimination of the danger of a new war, and immediately became the focus of attention for newspapers and radio commentaries around the world. This statement thoroughly exposed the anti-Soviet clamor of the Anglo-American bloc on the Berlin issue and the essence of the so-called neutral mediation by the six Security Council members. It made the hideous features of the Western politicians' aggression appear in their true form, and they were extremely embarrassed.

　　The results of the U.S. election held on November 2 have been revealed. Truman of the Democratic Party, a docile pawn of Wall Street's aggressive policies, was elected to a consecutive term as president. In both the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Democratic Party has also changed from a minority party to a majority party. According to statistics up to the 5th, Progressive Party presidential candidate Wallace received a total of 1.1 million votes. Under the crazy political persecution and intimidation campaign launched by the two parties' reactionaries against the Progressive Party, these more than one million votes are extremely valuable, although they are not enough to reflect the true strength of the Progressive Party. These more than one million people are undoubtedly a valuable foundation for the American progressive movement, and they will play a significant role on the American political stage in the future. As Wallace himself said, the Progressive Party's "greatest achievement is the creation of a people's party in ten months," and this party's "future task is to continue to develop its organization." As for the Democratic and Republican parties, Truman and Dewey, they are both ruling tools of American monopoly capital. The reason why Wall Street capitalists arranged the election struggle between the two sides was nothing more than to fool the people, allowing them to choose between six of one and half a dozen of the other. In this election, Dewey, relying on the open support of steel, aviation, oil and other consortia, and with the shouting and cheering of more than 80% of all reactionary newspapers and radios in the United States, blatantly appeared with a ferocious anti-Soviet and anti-labor face, and did not bother to conceal his reactionary nature in the campaign. But the results of the election proved that Dewey made a mistake. Although this election was very undemocratic, although this election did not change the domestic and foreign policies of American capitalists, and although any election itself cannot change the rule of American capitalists, this election showed that the American people do not want war, do not want aggressive policies, and do not want the oppression of labor. While Dewey lost the election, American voters also rejected eighty congressmen and eight senators from both the Republican and Democratic parties who had approved the Taft-Hartley anti-labor bill, and Hartley, one of the proposers of the bill, also lost the election. As for Truman's election, it does not mean that the American people support his aggressive imperialist policy and anti-communist and anti-labor domestic policy, but because Truman "in recent months has stolen various slogans from the arsenal of Roosevelt's 'New Deal' rhetoric" (Polish Workers' Daily) to deceive voters with disguises such as peace and prosperity, opposition to the Taft-Hartley Act, price controls, and a human rights platform. The American people's desire for peace and progress is the characteristic shown in this election.

　　This year is a year of decisive significance for the Soviet Union's post-war five-year plan. On the eve of the anniversary of the October Revolution, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) issued anniversary slogans to encourage the Soviet people to advance to the victory of communism, and leaders of communist parties in various countries also wrote articles to commemorate the anniversary of the October Revolution. Based on Stalin's proposal, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Soviet government promulgated on October 24 an important decision to transform nature and further develop socialist agriculture -- "Plan on Creating Forest Shelter Belts, Implementing Crop and Grass Rotation Systems, Building Ponds and Reservoirs to Guarantee Bumper Harvests Every Year in the Steppe and Forest-Steppe Zones of the European Part of the Soviet Union." The steppe and forest-steppe zones in the European part of the Soviet Union are vast and have fertile soil, and are the most important granaries of the Soviet Union, but periodic droughts and hot winds from the Central Asian desert often cause droughts. The purpose of the decision is to overcome droughts and ensure bumper harvests every year. The decision stipulates a plan that is unprecedented in agricultural history and is to be completed within fifteen years. After the completion of this plan, agricultural output will increase by fifty to one hundred percent. Now, in order to realize this great plan, collective farmers, agricultural workers, scientists and various experts from all over the country have begun to work hard.

　　The major strike of 350,000 French miners for "bread" has lasted for more than a month. Under the instructions of their American masters, the Queuille government has taken bloody means of suppression against this strike movement, and sent troops to occupy mines in various places. However, the reactionaries have not achieved their goals. Although they have occupied many mines, they have no way to make the unyielding miners go into production. Moreover, as a result of the dockworkers' sympathy for the strike, hundreds of thousands of tons of coal that they urgently shipped from foreign countries were left stranded on ships and could not be unloaded. The just struggle of French miners has received widespread sympathy at home and abroad. Farmers around the mines raised food and sent it to the workers, small merchants sold things to them at low prices, and committees organized by personnel in industrial, commercial, banking, or government agencies raised funds on an unprecedented scale as strike funds for the miners. At the same time, workers' groups and political parties in Italy, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Britain, the Netherlands and other countries have expressed sympathy or provided material assistance to French miners.

　　Other important international events in recent times are as follows:

　　(1) General Markos, Commander-in-Chief of the Greek Democratic Army, pointed out in an order on the second anniversary of the founding of the army that the Democratic Army has annihilated 120,000 enemies in the past two years, and predicted that it would inflict heavier blows on the enemy this winter.

　　(2) The Soviet army has begun to withdraw from North Korea. An army uprising against the Lee Seung-man puppet government occurred in South Korea.

　　(3) The Jewish Communist Party and the Arab Communist Party in Palestine have merged into the Communist Party of Israel.

　　(4) The German People's Council held its fifth meeting in Berlin to discuss and adopt the draft constitution of the German Democratic Republic.

　　(5) The United Nations General Assembly is still carrying out the activities of various committees, and the Political and Security Committee is currently debating the Greek issue.

　　国际一周
    斯大林于十月二十八日关于柏林形势问题对真理报记者发表了极其重要的谈话。斯大林明确地指出，美英法统治集团当前的政策是侵略的政策，发动新战争的政策。它们所要的不是和苏联协议与合作，而是谈论协议与合作，但又一再地阻挠、破坏协议与合作，从而“证明”与苏联合作不可能，“证明”有发动新战争之必要。斯大林同样明确地指出，它们这种政策的结果，只能是新战争鼓动者可耻的失败。全世界主张和平的人民大众的力量是如此强大，新战争的鼓动者战胜不了这种力量。斯大林的这一谈话打入了亿万渴求和平、要求消除新战争危险的人们的心坎，并立即成为全世界报纸与广播评论注视的焦点。这一谈话彻底地揭穿了英美集团在柏林问题上的反苏喧嚣，与六个安理会理事国的所谓中立调停的本质。使得西方政客们侵略主义的狰狞面貌，原形毕露，狼狈之至。
    十一月二日举行的美国大选，结果业已揭晓。华尔街侵略政策的驯顺走卒、民主党的杜鲁门，当选连任总统。在参众两院中，民主党亦由少数党变为多数党。据截至五日止的统计，进步党总统候选人华莱士共得一百一十万票。在两党反动派对进步党发动疯狂的政治迫害与恐吓运动下，这一百多万票是极其可贵的，虽然它尚不足以反映进步党的真正力量。这一百多万人，毫无疑义地是美国进步运动的宝贵基础，他们将在今后美国政治舞台上发挥重大的作用。正如华莱士自己所说的，进步党的“最伟大成就，是在于在十个月内创建了一个人民的政党”，这个政党“今后的任务是继续发展它的组织”。至于民主党和共和党，杜鲁门和村威，他们都是美国独占资本的统治工具，华尔街大资本家所以安排双方的选举斗争，其目的无非是愚弄人民，使人民在半斤和八两中间进行选择而已。这次大选中杜威因恃有钢铁、飞机、石油等财团的公开支持，有美国全部反动报纸和广播的百分之八十以上的呐喊助威，公然以反苏反劳工的狰狞面貌出现，在竞选中毫不介意掩饰他的反动本质。但是选举的结果证明杜威犯了错误。虽然这次的选举很不民主的，虽然这次选举决没有改变美国大资本家的内外政策，虽然任何选举本身都不能够改变美国大资本家的统治，但是这次选举究竟表明美国人民不要战争，不要侵略政策，不要对于劳工的压迫。与使杜威落选同时，美国选民还摒弃了那些曾经赞成塔夫脱——哈特莱反劳工法案的共和、民主两党的八十名众议员和八名参议员，该法案的提议人之一的哈特莱也落选了。至于杜鲁门的当选，并不是表示美国人民支持他的侵略性的帝国主义政策和反共反劳工的国内政策，而是因为杜鲁门在“近数月来从罗斯福‘新政’言论的武库中窃取了各种的口号”（波兰工人报），以和平繁荣、反对塔夫脱——哈特莱法案、管制物价、人权纲领等伪装来骗取选票。美国人民要求和平，要求进步的情绪，是这次大选中所表现出的特点。
    今年是苏联战后五年计划有决定意义的一年。在十月革命节纪念的前夕，联共中央发布了鼓舞苏联人民向共产主义胜利前进的纪念口号，各国共产党领袖亦纷纷撰文纪念十月革命节。联共中央及苏联政府根据斯大林的建议，于十月二十四日颁布了一项改造自然、进一步发展社会主义农业的重要决定——“关于创建森林防护带、实行农作物与牧草轮种制、建造池塘与蓄水池，保证苏联欧洲部分草原与森林草原地带年年丰收的计划”。苏联欧洲部分草原与森林草原地带幅员广阔，土壤肥沃，是苏联最重要的谷仓，但周期性的干旱与来自中亚细亚沙漠地带的热风，常造成旱灾。决定的目的就是要战胜旱灾、保证年年丰收。决定中规定了一个在农业史上空前巨大的计划，要在十五年内完成。这个计划完成以后，农产量将要增加百分之五十到一倍。现在，为着实现这一伟大的计划，各地的集体农民、农业工人、科学家和各种专家们，已经开始紧张地工作起来。
    法国三十五万矿工为“争面包”而举行的大罢工已经坚持了一月以上。在美国主子的指使之下，葛义政府对这次罢工运动采取了血腥的镇压手段，并派军队去占领各地的矿坑。但是，反动派并没有达到目的。他们虽然占领了很多矿坑，却没有法子使不屈服的矿工们进去生产，不仅如此，由于码头工人同情罢工的结果，他们急切地从外国运来的煤，有几十万吨搁置在轮船上卸不下来。法国矿工的正义斗争已得到国内外的广泛同情。矿场周围的农民募集食品送给工人，小商人以低廉价格卖东西给他们，工业、商业、银行或政府机关中人员组织的委员会，都以一种从未有过的规模募款作为矿工的罢工基金。同时，意、捷、罗、英、荷等国的工人团体和政党，都先后对法国矿工表示同情或者给予物质的援助。
    最近时期国际上的其他重要事件如下：
    （一）希腊民主军总司令马科斯将军在建军两周年的命令中指出，民主军两年以来已歼敌十二万人，并预告今冬将予敌人更沉重的打击。
    （二）苏军已开始自北朝鲜撤退。南朝鲜发生反对李承晚傀儡政府的军队起义。
    （三）巴勒斯坦境内的犹太共产党与阿刺伯共产党已合并为以色列共产党。
    （四）德国人民委员会在柏林举行第五届会议，讨论并通过了德国民主共和国宪法草案。
    （五）联合国大会仍在进行各委员会的活动，政治安全委员会刻正辩论希腊问题。
