　　North China Bureau Directly Subordinate Academic Committee Established
  　Theoretical Study Plan Set
    [Report from this newspaper] The Academic Committee of organizations directly under the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was formally established on November 17th, and a two-month theoretical study plan was formulated. The general branches of all directly subordinate units are establishing formal study organizations and discussing the implementation of the Academic Committee's plan. The study plan specifies the following standards for group composition and curriculum: Study organizations are divided into three categories: A, B, and C: 1. Category A includes senior cadres and those with considerable cultural and theoretical cultivation. The study content focuses on Chapter 4, Section 2 of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (i.e., Stalin's "Dialectical and Historical Materialism"), with reference to the "Communist Manifesto," "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific," and "Karl Marx" (see pages 1 to 55 of the newly compiled and printed "Lenin on Marx, Engels, and Marxism" by the Liberation Press). 2. Category B includes those with self-study ability, preliminary theoretical knowledge, and certain work experience. The study content is "A Brief History of Social Development," with reference to "On the State" and "From Ape to Man." Those with higher reading ability can refer to "A Concise Course in Social Science," "An Outline of Social Science," and "Social Economic Formations." 3. Category C is composed of some cadres who have certain work experience but a lower level of cultural and theoretical understanding, who cannot study independently, but who need to learn some theory. In addition to strengthening their cultural knowledge, their study will include organized lectures on "A Brief History of Social Development" at set times. Regarding study time, methods, and systems, it is stipulated that each general branch will organize study groups this month and enter the study phase, with the first phase ending at the end of January next year. The study method focuses on independent self-study, supplemented by collective research. Individuals are encouraged to use red and blue pens for marking, write marginal notes, take notes, write心得(personal reflections) (linking to practice), and publish articles; collective research includes raising questions to each other, casual talks, discussions, inviting people to give special answers or reports, holding discussion meetings, and展開論爭(unfolding debate). As long as meetings are held, regardless of size, preparations should be made in advance. Meetings without preparation waste time and yield little results, so they can be avoided, but prepared and substantive meetings should be held appropriately.
    The Academic Committee's leadership focuses on ideology, helping to discover problems and answer questions, ensuring that every question is answered (the directly subordinate Academic Committee can request instructions from the superior Academic Committee if it cannot answer), and constantly paying attention to the study mood of cadres. Strictly implement study discipline, hold regular examinations, praise the good, criticize the bad, and make a study evaluation of cadres every six months or when transferring jobs. In order to promote the study movement, the directly subordinate Academic Committee plans to publish a mimeographed study publication to guide, reflect, and exchange the study situations, experiences, and notes of the various branches, and send the better ones to party publications and party newspapers for publication. Each branch can also, according to its own situation, plan to set up wall newspapers, tabloids, study newsletters, etc.

　　华北局直属学委会成立
  　订出理论学习计划
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局直属机关学委会于十一月十七日正式成立，并制订出两个月的理论学习计划，全直属单位各总支正在建立正规学习组织，讨论执行学委会计划。学习计划中关于编组标准和学习课程，定为：学习组织分甲、乙、丙三类：１、凡高级干部及文化、理论确有相当修养者为甲类。学习内容以联共党史第四章第二节（即斯大林“辩证法的和历史的唯物论”）为中心，参考“共产党宣言”、“社会主义从空想到科学的发展”、“卡尔·马克思”（见解放社新编印的“列宁论马克思、恩格斯与马克思主义”第一页到五十五页）。２、凡文化上有自修能力，有初步的理论知识，且有一定的工作经验者为乙类。学习内容为“社会发展简史”，参考“论国家”、“从猿到人”。其中阅读能力较高者，可参考“社会科学简明教程”、“社会科学概论”、“社会经济形态”。３、有些干部具有一定的工作经验，但文化理论水平较低，不能独立自学，而又需要学点理论者，编为丙类。他们的学习，除了加强文化外，得以一定时间组织“社会发展简史”的讲课。关于学习时间、方法与制度，规定本月内各总支将学习组编好，即进入学习，到明年一月底为第一阶段。学习方法以独立自学为主，辅以集体研究。个人阅读提倡划红蓝线，批眉，作笔记，写心得（联系实际），发表文章等；集体研究，包括互相提问题，漫谈，座谈，请人作专题解答或报告，开讨论会，展开论争。只要是采取开会的形式，不论大会小会，事先都应有所准备，没有准备的会，浪费时间收效甚微，可以不开，但要适当召开有准备、有内容的会。
    学委会的领导重点放在思想上，帮助发现问题，解答问题，做到有问必答（直属学委不能解答可请示上级学委），随时注意干部的学习情绪。严格执行学习纪律，定期举行考试，好的表扬，坏的批评，每半年或于工作调动时，对干部要作一学习鉴定。为了推动学习运动，直属学委会准备出版一油印学习刊物，指导、反映、交流各分会学习情况、经验、笔记，选其优良者寄交党刊、党报发表。各分会亦可根据自己情况，筹设墙报、小报、学讯等。
