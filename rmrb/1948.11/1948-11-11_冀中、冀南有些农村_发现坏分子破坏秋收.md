　　Xinhua News Agency, North China, 9th: In the past two months, there have been repeated incidents of theft and sabotage of the autumn harvest in areas of central and southern Hebei. Among these, apart from a few cases of petty theft committed by a small number of vagrants who have not yet reformed due to poverty, the vast majority are acts of revenge and sabotage by bad elements. In the central Hebei region, the victims are mostly village cadres, families of revolutionary soldiers, and poor peasant households. For example, in Yujiawu in Ren (Qiu) He (Jian) County, the hay of four village cadres was burned down, and in Du Wanghua Village, over 300 yam plants belonging to a women's representative were pulled up, and the tobacco seedlings of Li Dawen's family were cut down. Incidents of arson in threshing grounds occurred in Juntuan, Yingzi Village, and Caozhuang in Jiaocheng County. In Gaoqiao Village, Raoyang County, eleven mu of millet belonging to a family of revolutionary soldiers was burned in the threshing ground, and ten mu of cabbage in Wangliuzhi Bridge Village was cut down. In Gaoyang County, a rich peasant stole the crops of six poor peasant families. In Nandai Village, Wuqiang County, four mu of crops belonging to the village chief were burned down. In Maoying Village, Shulu County, 300 cabbage plants belonging to the family of the Communist Party branch secretary were cut down. The onions of a farmers' association committee member in Angucheng were pulled out. In Matou Village, Shen County, three mu of millet belonging to a newly emancipated farmer was burned down, and theft of autumn crops also occurred in Xixinzhuang and Wangjiazhuang.

　　In the southern Hebei region, 400 jin of sorghum were stolen from Yanjiawu, Ji County. Many cases of crop theft were discovered in Wucheng County, and more than 1,000 jin of public grain were also stolen; theft of autumn crops also occurred in Chengci County. In addition to the occasional theft by vagrants, which should be addressed through education and reform, all politically motivated acts of sabotage deserve serious vigilance.

　　冀中、冀南有些农村
  　发现坏分子破坏秋收
    【新华社华北九日电】近两月来，冀中、冀南等地，曾屡次发生偷及破坏秋收事件。其中除个别的系少数尚未转变的游民分子因贫行窃外，绝大部分系坏分子的报复和破坏行为。冀中区遭受损失的多是村干部、抗属和贫农家庭。如任（邱）河（间）县于家坞有四个村干部的干草被人放火烧毁，杜王化村一个妇女代表的山药，被人拔掉三百多棵，李大文一家的旱烟苗，被人砍掉。交河县的军团、营子村、曹庄均发生坏分子纵火烧场事件。饶阳县高桥村一家抗属十一亩谷子在场里被人放火烧掉，王刘之桥村有十亩白菜被人砍掉。高阳县有一个富农偷了六家贫农的庄稼。武强县南代村村长有四亩庄稼被人放火烧掉。束鹿县毛营共产党支部书记家被人砍掉白菜三百棵。安古城一家农会委员的葱被人拔掉。深县马头村一家新翻身农民的三亩谷子被人放火烧掉，西辛庄、王家庄也都发生了偷秋事件。
    冀南区冀县燕家坞被人偷走高粱四百斤。武城县发现偷庄稼的不少，公粮也被偷一千多斤；成磁县也发生了偷秋问题。以上除了游民的偶尔偷窃，应予以教育和改造外，一切带政治性的破坏行为，值得严重警惕。
