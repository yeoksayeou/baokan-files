To all levels of Kuomintang troops and officers:

This time, in the Jinan campaign, Yaowu and others were responsible for the local military and political affairs of Shandong, and were deeply moved by what they saw and felt. We would like to inform you of the process of the liberation of Jinan and the important measures taken by the People's Liberation Army after entering the city:

In the past six months, Zi, Bo, Zhou, Zhang, Chang, Wei, and Yanzhou have successively fallen. Jinan has become an isolated island, and a battle of offense and defense is inevitable. The Jiang government, in view of this, transported troops by air on the one hand, replenished ammunition on the other, and urged local authorities to strengthen their offensive and prepare for war. By the eve of the outbreak of the war, the available troops numbered approximately 100,000, and the ammunition and rations were sufficient for two months. In addition, the fortifications were strong, and they could wait for the enemy in a position of strength. Looking at the overall battlefield situation, although the complete annihilation of the enemy was inevitable in the end, a longer period of resistance was still more than sufficient. Unexpectedly, the collapse was decided in only eight days. Wu Huawen's uprising did have an impact, but the main reason was that every soldier of the People's Liberation Army fought with a determination to die for their lofty ideals and for the people, striving for the final victory. However, the officers and soldiers under the anti-people government Jiang clique were mostly limited by the environment and forced to fight, unwilling to make meaningless sacrifices for the private interests of the Jiang, Song, Kong, and Chen families. It is not difficult to predict the outcome of a reactionary armed force with no ideology, no ideals, and forced to be cannon fodder for Jiang and the US, against a revolutionary army with awareness, ideals, and willing to serve the people.

After the People's Liberation Army entered the city, they immediately made seven chapters of law with the people, the main points of which are: to protect the lives and property of people of all classes and their democratic freedom; to encourage responsible personnel of cultural, educational, health, and religious organizations to continue to perform their duties as usual; to guarantee that all officials of the Kuomintang provincial, municipal, and county governments, as well as personnel such as district, township, town, and pao chiefs, will not be captured or arrested if they do not resist with weapons; to protect foreigners; and to buy and sell fairly, without taking a single needle or thread from the people. All of the above points have been implemented effectively. The welcome and encouragement of the Jinan citizens to the People's Liberation Army cannot be described in words.

After Yaowu and others were liberated, they initially thought that they would be humiliated for their sins. Unexpectedly, the People's Liberation Army strictly implemented a policy of leniency, not blaming the past, and providing opportunities for self-renewal and learning. We are deeply grateful and ashamed for the benefits we have received. Observing the current international environment, the people's democratic forces are surging and irresistible, while the anti-people reactionary forces are outwardly strong but inwardly weak and are declining day by day. The day when the people of the world will see the light of liberation again is not far away. The collapse and destruction of the Jiang clique, the anti-people government in China, is even more imminent. You are all discerning people and should make a decisive decision about your future course of action. Whether it is an uprising on the battlefield, laying down your weapons, making meritorious service and receiving rewards, or offsetting your crimes with meritorious service, you will all be loved and understood by the broad masses of the people, and your bright future will be guaranteed. We sincerely express our thoughts and hope you will consider them carefully.

　　济南兖州潍县等战役中放下武器的国民党军高级将领
    王耀武霍守义  陈金城等　告国民党官兵书全国国民党各级部队官兵钧鉴：
    此次济南战役，耀武等身负山东地方军政责任，身临其境，观感綦切。愿将济南解放经过及解放军入城后重要措施，为诸君陈之：
    近半年来，淄、博、周、张、昌、潍、兖州相继失守，济南形成孤岛，攻守之战，势所必然。蒋政府有鉴及此，一面空运部队，一面充实弹药，并督饬地方当局，加强攻势，严整战备，截至战争爆发前夕，可用之兵，约计十万，弹药粮秣，足敷两月之需，加以工事坚强，以逸待劳。环顾整个战场形势，全歼之局，虽属终所不免；惟较长时间之抵抗，尚属绰有余裕。殊意溃灭之局，仅决以八日之间。吴化文之起义，固有影响，惟主要原因，在于解放军之每个战士，均系为其崇高之理想与为人民而战，以必死之心，争最后胜利，而反人民政府蒋集团下之各级官兵，大都均系囿于环境，被迫作战，均不甘愿为蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族之私人利益，作无谓之牺牲。以无主义、无理想、被迫为蒋美作炮灰之反动武装，对抗有认识、有理想、自愿为人民服务之革命军队，胜负之数不卜可知。
    解放军入城后，即日与人民约法七章，择其要意，重在：保障各阶层人民生命财产，民主自由；慰勉文化教育卫生机关及宗教团体等负责人员，照常供职；保证凡国民党省、市、县、各级政府机关官员及区、乡、镇、保长等人员，如不持枪抵抗，一律不加俘虏逮捕；保护外侨；公买公卖，不取民间一针一线。以上各点，均经确切执行。济南市民，对解放军欢迎鼓舞之情形，非笔墨所能形容。
    耀武等被解放后，初意带罪之身，必遭凌辱。殊意解放军厉行宽大政策，不咎既往，并予以自新及学习机会，受惠之余，感愧弥深。默察当前国际环境，人民民主力量奔腾澎湃，不可抗拒，反人民之反动力量，则外强中干，日趋没落，全世界人民解放重睹光明之期，已不在远。中国反人民政府蒋集团之崩溃覆灭，更属指日可期。诸君明达，对于未来出处，应当机立断，善自抉择，或战场起义，或放下武器，或立功受奖，或将功折罪，均将受到广大人民之爱护谅解，而保证诸君之光明前途。谨布腹悃，愿垂察焉。
