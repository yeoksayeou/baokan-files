　　Correspondence No. 14

To all regional committees, county and city committees, offices, and fellow correspondents:

    According to submissions from various regions, some areas are nearing completion of the second phase of land reform and preliminary party rectification in villages, but there have been very few reports on this to date. We hope everyone will promptly report on the progress of the previous work, the problems encountered, and the lessons learned, either comprehensively or with specific reporting on typical villages. How is the winter production work being integrated with other work? What achievements have been made in mass development of handicrafts and sideline occupations, and preparations for next year's production? What problems still exist? What is the production enthusiasm of the masses after the land reform? We hope for rapid reporting on all of these.

To the comrades of the Jinnan Third Regional Committee Office:

    The five materials and four pieces of correspondence you sent have been received, and are currently being studied and processed separately. We also hope you can write a comprehensive report on the progress of winter work in the various counties.

To the Jinnan Fifth Special Administrative Office and Comrade Zhao Qing of Zhengping:

    Your October work report and learning summary have been received. We believe it is very good that you have made it a working system to send us comprehensive reports regularly. We also hope you can send us a copy of the ten-day report to the Administrative Office.

To Comrade Ou Zheng of the Third District of Feixiang, Jinnan:

    After receiving the survey on the situation of rural branches, we have not received any further submissions. We hope you will promptly write about the progress of each phase of work after you have understood the situation.
