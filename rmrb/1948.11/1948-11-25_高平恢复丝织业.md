(Taiyue Electric) Under the support of the democratic government, the silk weaving industry in Gaoping has recovered to 50% of its pre-war level. Silk weaving is an important source of income for some farmers in the county, accounting for more than 50% of their total annual income. The average land per person in the county is 2.6 mu. If each mu produces 8 dou of refined grain, totaling just over 2 shi, it is still not enough to maintain a living. Therefore, the silk weaving industry, like the iron industry, is an important source of income for local farmers. Before the war, the silk weaving industry in the county was mostly a household side business, scattered in more than 20 villages such as Nanzaili and Fengzhuang north of the city. There were a total of 3,908 households, with 19,864 participants, accounting for 9.14% of the county's total population. According to statistics from the three villages of Zaili, Fengzhuang, and Zhuzhuang, silk weaving accounts for 58.44% of their total annual income. After the Japanese invaders intruded, they plundered and destroyed almost everything. For example, in villages such as Zaili, Mishan, Zhuzhuang, and Shanghanzhuang south of the city, there were more than 300 looms, which completely stopped production by 1945. In Fengzhuang and other villages north of the city, more than 200 looms were also reduced to just over 60, barely weaving some local silk, handkerchiefs, and Luo di. More valuable items such as pure gauze, crepe, satin, and plain silk were no longer woven. Workers were scattered, changed jobs, or were even killed. After liberation, under the support of the democratic government, loans were organized. In the two and a half years from the end of 1945 to August of this year, 269 households have been restored. Because this kind of silk weaving is convenient for family operation, each family can participate in production with one to four looms, and the capital required is not much, so the vast majority operate as family units. There are 253 privately operated households (including 47 mutually-aided operations), 7 publicly operated households, and 9 cooperatively operated households. There are a total of 619 workers and 314 looms. In terms of the number of looms, it has reached more than half of the pre-war 600. Various more valuable goods such as satin and crepe have also been woven, which has greatly increased the income of local farmers. For example, the cooperative run by Qin Taiping originally had a capital of 200,000 yuan. From February 1946 to now, it has distributed dividends four times, totaling 6.17 million yuan, and accumulated a capital of 2.2 million yuan. The main reasons why it still cannot quickly recover to the pre-war level are: (1) Lack of skilled workers. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, many skilled workers were killed by the Japanese invaders. In addition, there were famines and escapes, and no good training was provided, resulting in a great shortage of skilled workers, making it impossible to develop on a large scale. (2) Failure to actively improve tools has resulted in low-quality products, irregular sales, and abnormal profits, making it impossible to develop on a large scale. (3) Lack of organizational leadership. Some people, in order to seek profit, cut corners, produced low-quality goods, which affected sales. On the other hand, capital constraints prevent large-scale development. Therefore, to develop the silk weaving industry in Gaoping, it is first necessary to train a large number of skilled workers to improve technology. Secondly, tools should be improved, and simple machines should be tried, such as small doubling machines for twisting thread. Jacquard looms from Qi County and Pingyao can also be tried. Reward technicians for improving tools. For example, Zhao Jiabi, manager of the County Federation of Cooperatives, is researching and setting up a foot-operated Jacquard loom, and should be encouraged and helped to achieve success. (4) Advocate cooperation between three or five households to expand capital, improve technology, and improve quality to establish credibility and promote sales.

　　高平恢复丝织业
    【太岳电】在民主政府扶植下，高平丝织业已恢复到战前百分之五十。该县丝织业为一部分农民的重要收入之一，占全年总收入百分之五十以上。按全县土地平均每人有二亩六分，以每亩生产细粮八斗计算，合二石多，仍不足维持生活。因此丝织业与铁业同样为当地农民之重要收入。该县丝织业战前大部为家庭副业性质，散布于城南北宰李、冯庄等廿余村；共有三千九百零八家，参加生产者有一万九千八百六十四人，占全县总人口的百分之九点一四。根据宰李、冯庄、朱庄三村的统计：每年依靠丝织收入占其总收入的百分之五十八点四四。日寇侵入后，掠夺摧残殆尽。如城南宰李、米山、朱庄、上韩庄等村，原有机子三百多架，到四五年完全停顿。城北冯庄等村二百多架机子，也剩下六十多架，勉强织些土绸、手绢、罗底，比较名贵的净纱、绉、绫、素等均已停织。工人也四散或转业，甚至被残杀。解放后，在民主政府扶植下，贷款组织，由一九四五年年底到今年八月两年半时间内，已恢复了二百六十九家。又因为这种丝织业便利于家庭经营，每家按一架到四架机子，全家都能参加生产，需要资本又不多，所以绝大部分以家庭经营为单位。私营的就有二百五十三家（其中互助经营的四十七家），公营七家，合作经营的九家。共有工人六百一十九人，开机子三百一十四架。按机数说，已达到战前六百架的半数以上。也织开了各种绫、绉等较名贵货品，即给当地农民增加了很大一部分收入。如秦泰平经营的合作社，原资本二十万元，从一九四六年二月到现在，已分了四次红利，共计六百一十七万元，并积累了资本二百二十万元。目前所以还不能迅速恢复到战前水平，主要有这些原因：（一）缺少技术工人。抗战八年，技术工人被日寇杀害不少，又加灾荒、逃亡，又没很好培养，致技术工人非常缺乏，无法大量发展。（二）在工具上未能积极设法改进，出品提不高，影响销路不经常，利润也不正常，也就不敢大量发展。（三）缺少人组织领导，有些人为了贪图利润，就偷工省料、粗制滥造、出的货质量很低，影响了销路。另一方面，资本限制不能往大发展。因此要发展高平丝织业，首先须大量培养技术工人，将技术提高一步。其次改良工具，试用简单机器，如打线可用小型合股机，祁县、平遥的提花楼机也可试行采用。奖励技工改良工具。如县联社经理赵家璧，研究设置脚踏提花机，应鼓励帮助其实现成功。（四）提倡三家五家合作经营，以扩大资本改进技术，并提高质量，以树立信用，推广销路。
