　　You Should Focus on Supporting the Public Service
    Question: I used to be a soldier. I knew carpentry before, and I had some furniture, but I didn't do it for long. This summer, I bought some trees with others and promised to make several looms for people, planning to be a carpenter long-term. However, the village insists that I support the long-term public service. If I go to support the long-term public service, it will greatly affect my handicraft work. According to government decrees, workers only pay commutation rice and do not support long-term public service. How should this problem be solved?
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Gao Ping Liu Laiyan
    Answer: Taking care of the handicraftsmen's production from being affected, paying commutation rice and not supporting long-term public service, this is to promote the development of handicrafts. It is very wrong to take advantage of this to avoid public service. You bought trees this summer and planned to be a carpenter long-term, this is just a plan. You haven't been doing carpentry work all the time. Waiting for the public service to come, you use your carpentry work as an excuse not to support the public service, which is even more inappropriate. If you really want to make a living as a carpenter in the future, you should have it evaluated at a mass meeting before you can commute the public service into rice and not support the public service.

　　你要安心支差
    问：我过去是个当军人的，以前我就会木匠，也有家具，可是没有长干，今年夏天我和旁人伙买了一些树，又应承给人家做几张织布机，打算长期干木匠。可是村里非叫我支长差不可，要是去支长差，对于我的手工业很受影响，按政府法令，工人只出折勤米，不支长差，这个问题应如何解决？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　高平刘来雁
    答：照顾手工业者生产不受影响，出勤工米不支长差，这是为了促使手工业的发展，从这里面钻空子躲差务是很不对的，你夏天买下树打算长期干木匠，这只是个打算，并没有一直做木匠活，等着差来了，借着你做木匠活支吾不支差，这是更不应该的。如果你今后真正要以做木匠为生，应该在群众会议上评定后，才能折出差米不支差。
