Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th. State-run farms in the four provinces of Heilongjiang, Nenjiang, Songjiang, and Hejiang have successfully completed the harvesting of various grains. According to statistics from farms operated by various agencies in Hejiang Province, and the First, Second, and Third Farms operated by the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, and the Tonghua Farm operated by the Northeast Political Committee, a total of over 200,000 mu of paddy and dry land were planted. Among them, the Hejiang Water Conservancy Farm and the Second and Third Farms of Heilongjiang Province planted a total of 21,000 mu of paddy rice, which can yield 9.68 million catties of rice. Due to careful cultivation and timely irrigation, the rice harvest was abundant. The average yield per mu was 1.2 dan (1 dan is 30 catties), and the highest reached 2 dan. The First Farm used machinery entirely, with a total of 19 tractors. One self-propelled combine harvester can harvest 100 mu per day, and a horse-drawn harvester can harvest 40-50 mu per day. The farm's 10,000 mu of millet (i.e., sorghum) was harvested in ten days. During threshing, one machine can thresh the grain from 200 mu of land in one day.

Having successfully completed the harvest, the state-run farms in various locations have now entered a period of intense plowing, opening up autumn wasteland, and planting winter wheat. The Tonghua Mechanical Farm has also dispatched six tractors for plowing, with each tractor plowing an average amount of land equivalent to what 14 laborers and 56 horses could plow manually. The farm has already plowed 1,800 mu. The Ning'an Mechanical Farm in Songjiang Province is using ten tractors to open up autumn wasteland in a concentrated effort, aiming to complete 15,000 mu before the ground freezes. Winter wheat trials conducted by the Tongbei County Farm have sprouted to a height of four inches (note: in the past, farmers in Northeast China did not plant winter wheat due to the cold climate, only spring wheat, but now successful trials have been achieved through the active experimentation of state-run farms).

The operating methods of state-run farms in various locations are as follows: (1) Employing workers. (2) Joint operation with farmers, where the public provides machinery, farm tools, and capital, while the farmers provide labor, and the autumn harvest is divided equally or on a 40/60 basis after deducting seeds. (3) Dispatching service personnel or armed personnel from agencies to plant. Many farms use a combination of two or three methods. The Second and Third Farms in Heilongjiang Province are operated in cooperation with farmers. A total of over 590 farmers participated in the operation. The two farms planted a total of over 13,000 mu of paddy rice, which is expected to yield at least 17,200 dan of rice. After deducting 1,500 dan of rice seeds, the remaining rice is divided equally. The public can obtain over 7,800 dan, and after deducting the annual consumption (including depreciation of tools and food for the cooperating farmers), the public can obtain a net profit of 59 percent. The farmers also benefit significantly. Based on general labor, each person can cultivate 25 mu of land per year, producing 30 dan of rice. After deducting 2.5 dan of seeds and 2.5 dan for hiring casual labor during busy seasons, 25 dan remain. After dividing this amount equally, the farmer gets 12.5 dan, plus the divided straw, totaling over 13 dan of rice, which far exceeds the income of general agricultural labor. Therefore, the farmers' morale is high, reversing their initial concerns about the failure of the operation, and they are requesting an expansion of production next year. Experience in various locations has proven that employing workers is convenient for flexible deployment, centralized education, cultivating machine farming techniques, and promoting organizational skills in production, and can encourage them to work for the farm for a long time. However, since farmers have their own cultivated land after the land reform, it is difficult to hire a large number of workers, and if education is relaxed, the enthusiasm for labor is easily reduced, and labor mobility can also occur. Joint operation with farmers, on the other hand, makes it easier to promote production enthusiasm because the farm's interests are closely linked to their own interests, and there is less labor mobility. The disadvantage is that it is not easy to deploy and educate flexibly, and management is not as convenient as employing workers. Agency service personnel can only serve as an auxiliary force during busy farming seasons.

State-run farms in various locations have been established through exploration and development by continuously overcoming difficulties. For example, state-run farms in Hejiang Province initially experienced a general lack of organizational leadership and extravagant waste; in terms of operation, there was a simple fiscal revenue perspective of "farming to make money"; in terms of staffing, people who did not understand agricultural technology, had nowhere to be placed, or had made mistakes were sent to be leading cadres; in terms of education and management, organizational skills were poor, there was a lack of systems, and some even used the old perspectives of landlords employing workers to lead workers. After June, ideological education for cadres and workers was strengthened, the above-mentioned confused ideas were resolved, and various systems and methods (such as leave, rewards and punishments, meeting reports, learning, budget preparation, etc.) were established. Labor covenants were widely established through the masses, and labor competitions were launched, which achieved significant results. Currently, the Hejiang Junde Farm and county-run farms such as Huachuan and Boli have begun to conduct economic accounting and scientific management in order to gradually develop towards enterprise management.

### 东北各地公营农场　克服困难胜利发展

　　东北各地公营农场
  　克服困难胜利发展
    【新华社东北十日电】黑龙江、嫩江、松江、合江四省公营农场已胜利完成各种粮食收割。仅据合江全省各机关经营之农场及黑龙江省委经营之第一、第二、第三农场及东北政委会经营之通化农场等统计，即共种水、旱地廿余万亩；其中合江水利农场及黑省第二、第三农场即共种水稻二万一千亩，可收稻子九百六十八万斤。由于耕作精细，灌溉及时，故稻产丰稔。每亩平均产量一石二斗（一斗三十斤），最高者竟达两石。第一农场全部使用机器，该场共有拖拉机十九台。一台自割自捆机每天能割百亩，马拉收割机每天能割四五十亩。该场万亩稷子（即秫子）十天内即收割完毕。打场时，一台机器一天即能打二百亩地的粮食。
    胜利完成收割的公营农场，现已进入紧张的翻地、开秋荒、种冬麦等工作中。通化机械农场亦已出动六台拖拉机翻地，平均每天每台所翻土地，等于人工耕种时用十四个劳力和五十六匹马所翻的土地。现该场已翻地一千八百亩。松江省营宁安机械农场以十台拖拉机突击开秋荒，拟争取于地冻前完成开秋荒一万五千亩。通北县营农场试种之冬麦已出苗四寸（按：过去东北农民以气候寒冷均不种冬麦，只种春麦，现经公营农场积极试验，始获成功）。
    各地公营农场经营方式，有以下三种：（一）雇工经营。（二）与农民合伙经营，即公家出机器、农具、资本等，农民出劳力，秋收后除去种籽对半分或四六分。（三）从机关抽调勤杂人员或武装人员种。很多农场兼用两三种形式。黑龙江省营第二、第三两农场即系采取和农民合伙经营办法经营。参加经营的农民共五百九十余人。该两场共种水稻一万三千余亩，最低可获稻子一万七千二百余石。扣除一千五百石稻种后对半平分，公家可得七千八百余石，减去全年消耗（包括工具等的折旧及合伙农民之膳食在内），公家可得纯利百分之五十九。农民方面获利亦厚。以一般劳动力计算，每人每年可耕种二十五亩地，产稻三十石，减去种籽两石五斗，及农忙时雇零工费两石五斗，可剩下二十五石，对半分后农民得十二石五斗，加上所分谷草，共合稻子十三石多，远超过一般农业劳动收入，因此农民情绪很高，一反开始怕经营失败的顾虑而要求明年扩大生产。各地经验证明：雇工经营便于机动使用，集中教育，培养机器耕作技术，易发扬生产中的组织性，并可争取其长期为农场工作。但因土地改革后农民都有自耕土地，大量雇工较困难，且如教育放松，劳动积极性即容易低落，劳动力亦会发生流动现象。与农民合伙经营则因农场利益与其本身利益结合密切，故易发挥生产积极性，劳力流动现象亦少。缺点是不易机动使用与教育，管理上不及雇工方便。而机关勤杂人员则只能作农忙时的辅助力量。
    各地公营农场都是在摸索中创建与不断克服困难中发展起来的。如合江省各地公营农场开始普遍发生缺乏组织领导及铺张浪费现象；在经营上存在“种地为赚钱”的单纯财政收入观点，配备干部上，把不懂农业技术、无处安插或犯错误的人派去当领导干部；在教育管理上组织性差，缺乏制度，有的甚至拿地主管雇工的旧观点来领导工人。六月以后，加强了干部和工人的思想教育，解决了上述糊涂思想，并确定了各种制度和办法（如请假、奖惩、会议汇报、学习、预决算等），普遍通过群众订立了劳动公约，发动劳动竞赛，收到了显著成绩。现合江峻德农场及桦川、勃利等县营农场已开始进行经济核算与科学管理，以便逐渐向企业化发展。
