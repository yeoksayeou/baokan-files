　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. The People's Army, led by the Indonesian Communist Party, continues to wage guerrilla warfare in Central Java. According to a Batavia Dutch Army news source on the 8th, the People's Army is conducting new activities in Central Java, capturing Sacigan and advancing towards Norabi, midway between Molifen and Suowei. On October 23rd, while announcing the occupation of Paiditan on the south coast of Java and that the People's armed uprising had been "suppressed," the Hatta government had to admit that it must prepare to deal with expanded guerrilla warfare because the units led by the Communist Party generally remained intact and armed. According to the Hatta government's estimates, the People's Army scattered in various places numbers about 10,000. In order to suppress the People's armed struggle and pave the way for surrender to American and Dutch imperialism, the Hatta government is implementing a policy of extreme and bloody terror. It is carrying out large-scale arrests in Molifen and other areas where the People's Army has withdrawn, and has ordered that the communists arrested in Molifen be hanged. The massacre of communists has long been a despicable goal secretly plotted by the Hatta government. According to a report by the Telegraph Agency on the 5th, Dutch Communist Party General Secretary Grot revealed this conspiracy, stating that news from Indonesia confirms that as early as the beginning of July, Sukarno, Hatta, and the American representative of the UN "mediation" committee held a secret meeting. At the meeting, the American representative promised to supply the Hatta government with weapons to attack the communists and allowed Hatta to obtain a candidate position in the federal government proposed by the Netherlands. Grot also stated that the so-called "communist rebellion" in Molifen on September 18th was actually caused by provocations from Hatta's side. After the Molifen provocation, the Communist Party was declared illegal, and 55 percent of the left-wing members of parliament were excluded, and the parliament became a tool in Hatta's hands.
　　While disputes arise between the Netherlands and the Hatta government due to haggling, the Dutch government replaced Mook as governor and replaced him with former Prime Minister Bidau, and also dispatched Dutch Foreign Minister Stiek to Indonesia. Stiek, who had discussed ways to combat the "spread of communism" with Marshall in Washington and Paris, announced in Batavia on the 1st of this month that his trip was to negotiate with the Hatta government on the formation of a so-called temporary government of the "United States of Indonesia" before January 1st next year, in accordance with the Renville Agreement.

　　印尼人民军奋战中爪哇  占领萨芝干进逼诺拉比
    【新华社陕北十三日电】印尼共产党领导的人民军仍不断在中爪哇进行游击战。据巴达维亚荷兰陆军新闻处八日消息：人民军在中爪哇进行新的活动，占领萨芝干，正向茉莉芬与梭维中途之诺拉比进展。十月廿三日，哈达政府于宣布占领爪哇南岸派齐丹以及人民武装起义已告“扑灭”的同时，却又不得不承认必须准备应付扩大的游击战，因为共产党领导的各部队，一般的仍然完整，并有武装。据哈达政府方面估计，散开在各地的人民军约有万人。为镇压人民武装斗争与铺平投降美荷帝国主义的道路，哈达政府正施行极度恐怖的血腥政策。它在茉莉芬及其他人民军退出的地区，大肆捕人，并下令将在茉莉芬逮捕的共产党人处以绞刑。屠杀共产党人原是哈达政府许久以来所密谋的卑鄙目的。据电通社五日报导荷共总书记格罗特对此密谋的揭发称：从印尼得来的消息证实，早在七月初，苏加诺、哈达和联合国“调处”委员会美方代表，曾举行秘密会议。会上，美国代表答应供给哈达政府武器，以进攻共产党人，并允许支持哈达在荷兰建议的联邦政府中取得候选人地位。格罗特又称，九月十八日在茉莉芬的所谓“共产党叛乱”，其实是由哈达方面的挑衅引起的。茉莉芬挑衅事件发生后，共产党即被宣布为非法，国会中百分之五十五的左翼议员被排斥了，国会变成了哈达手中的工具。
    当荷兰与哈达政府之间因讨价还价而发生争执之时，荷兰政府撤换了穆克的总督职务，并以前总理比多来代替他，又派遣荷外长斯蒂克前往印尼。曾在华盛顿与巴黎和马歇尔商谈抗击“共产主义之蔓延”办法的斯蒂克，本月一日在巴达维亚宣布，他此行是为了根据伦维尔协定，与哈达政府谈判关于在明年一月一日前组成所谓“印尼合众国”的临时政府问题。
