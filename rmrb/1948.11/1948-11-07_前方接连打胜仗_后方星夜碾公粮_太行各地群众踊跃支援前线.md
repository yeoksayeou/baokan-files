　　Front Lines Score Successive Victories
  　Rear Areas Pound Grain Day and Night
  　Masses in Taihang Eagerly Support the Front Lines
    [Taihang Electric] Upon hearing the great victories of the People's Liberation Army in successively liberating major cities such as Jinan, Jinzhou, Changchun, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Baotou, annihilating more than 400,000 enemy troops, and especially upon hearing the news that Taiyuan was about to be taken, the masses here were extremely excited. They pounded rice day and night and actively delivered public grain, powerfully supporting the victory of the front lines. After the autumn harvest in Hanchuan Village, Third District of Changzhi, the masses started pounding grain automatically, even before the public grain quotas were assigned. The wife of branch secretary Han Biao Xian had already pounded the good "811" grain from this year's autumn harvest, making it fine and yellow, ten days ago. She said, "Not to mention that we have harvested a lot of grain this year, enough to eat and wear, even if we eat less ourselves, we must let the soldiers at the front have enough to eat to win battles." Li Yongshu and Yuan Caigui's two groups, a total of fifteen households, have now pounded eleven *shi* of rice. Old man Guo Tieliang said excitedly, "Hurry up and pound! Look at the victories at the front! Taiyuan will soon be taken." When the village chief of Huayuan Village in Gaoyi heard in the district that the public grain collection was about to begin, he automatically convened a meeting of cadres upon returning to the village. According to the specific situation of the village, they discussed the preparatory work for the delivery of public grain, deciding that cadres should publicize in different areas, mobilizing the masses to "dry early, pound early, and deliver early." They also repaired all five broken millstones and seven broken winnowing fans in the village, letting the households that had planted wheat first pound, and those who had not finished planting should rush to plant for two days and then pound, so that they would not miss planting wheat or compete for the millstones. In order to strive for early completion, the millstones were not idle day or night. Beiguan Village in Biandi, Jixian, divided the work of storing grain as follows: each millstone was assigned four old men, two women, and four donkeys, who took turns pounding rice day and night. The militia was responsible for transporting grain, and the amount was allocated according to diligence, with each ten households transporting 200 *jin*. Whoever finished sending grain first could go to plant wheat, which stimulated everyone's enthusiasm. The village cadres also specifically divided the work. The militia captain led the transportation of grain, and the director of the Armed Forces Committee grasped the situation at the front, guarding and protecting the work in the rear. On the first day and night, the whole village pounded twenty *shi*, achieving pounding, delivering, and transporting at the same time. Every morning, the militia arrived at the village office, vying to carry the grain.

　　前方接连打胜仗
  　后方星夜碾公粮
  　太行各地群众踊跃支援前线
    【太行电】此间各地群众听到人民解放军连续解放济南、锦州、长春、郑州、开封、包头等大城市，歼敌四十多万的伟大胜利，尤其是听到太原将要打下的消息后，大家兴奋异常，星夜碾米，踊跃交纳公粮，有力的支援前线胜利。长治三区韩川村群众收秋完毕后，公粮还没有派下来，就自动碾开了。支书韩彪仙的女人，前十来天就把今年秋收的好“八一一”谷碾的又细又黄，她说：“不用说咱今年收的粮食不少，有吃有穿，就是自己少吃些。也得叫前方战士吃饱饭打胜仗”。李永书和原才贵两个组，共十五户，现在已碾好十一石米。郭铁良老汉兴奋的说：“赶快碾吧！看看前方的胜利！太原又快打下来了。”高邑花园村村长在区上听说快要起公粮了，回去就自动召集干部开会，按照本村具体情况，商议交收公粮的准备工作，决定干部分片宣传，动员群众“早晒、早碾、早交”。并把全村的五盘坏碾七个坏扇车修好，让种上麦子的户先碾，没有种完的突击两天种上再碾，既不误种麦，又不争碾子。为了争取早日完成，白天黑夜碾子不闲。汲县边地北官村，在屯粮中是这样分工的：每盘碾分配四个老汉、两个妇女、四头驴，白天黑夜轮流碾米。自卫队专管运粮，按勤分分了数目，每十分担运二百斤，谁送完谁去种麦，刺激了大家的积极性。村干部也具体分了工。自卫队长领导运粮，武委会主任掌握前边情况，放哨，掩护后方工作。开头一天一夜，全村即碾了二十多石，做到随碾、随交、随运。每天早上自卫队齐到村公所，争先恐后的抢着挑着。
