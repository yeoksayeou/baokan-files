Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th. The Yantai workers who have seen the light of day again, recounted their history of blood and tears to reporters. After Yantai was occupied by the enemy last year, the city's electric company was controlled by the enemy's henchman, Xu Chuande. In October of this year, two fellow workers were labeled as "Eighth Route Army" and were brutally buried alive. More than 50 other employees were arrested or dismissed. The remaining few workers were also driven out of the factory when the electricity was cut off in May this year. The enemy troops plundered as much as 200 tons of the company's machinery and tools. Before the enemy fled, they destroyed three generators. Finally, the enemy even attempted to reverse the high and low voltage to destroy the city's electrical equipment. After hearing the news, workers Gao Shaoyu and other nine people, regardless of the danger of being conscripted by the enemy, overcame all difficulties and returned to the power plant to hide and secretly guard the machines, preventing the enemy's sabotage conspiracy from succeeding. Old worker Pi Zongfang, who was over seventy years old, also insisted on guarding the factory, waiting for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army. After the liberation of Yantai, more than 20 workers from the factory immediately participated in the resumption of work and construction. After seventeen days of efforts, electricity began to be supplied on November 1st.

　　The dockworkers of the city also carried out heroic struggles to resist the persecution of the Kuomintang during the enemy occupation. The eight cooperatives organized by dockworkers during the period of the People's Government, such as ironworkers and fish traders, were all confiscated after the enemy occupied Yantai, and more than 40 large and small sampans (i.e., rowing boats) and more than 100 flatbed carts (i.e., small carts pushed and pulled by manpower to transport goods) were looted. The enemy also sent the special agent Mou Zidong as the general foreman of the dockworkers' union, specifically responsible for suppressing the workers, forcing them to repair fortifications and transport military supplies every day. At the beginning, the enemy stipulated that each person would be paid 150,000 yuan of Chiang currency per day, but Mou Zidong only paid 20,000 yuan, and later he did not pay a penny, but still required the workers to bear household registration, military service, comfort, and Baojia taxes, forcing many workers and their families to rely on begging to survive. In the spring of this year, the workers launched a three-day strike for this reason. Their slogan was "Rather be beaten to death than starved to death," and as a result, they achieved considerable victory. In May of this year, the Kuomintang Seamen's Party Department again gathered the dockworkers and immediately arrested 448 strong men and formed them into teams. Upon hearing the news, the workers' families launched a struggle to "demand their husbands and children." After the liberation of Yantai, most of the arrested workers had run back. The People's Government has initially solved the livelihood of unemployed workers by organizing transportation. A total of 1,038 flatbed carts were organized in the city, transporting 574,000 catties of grain. Each cart could earn 30 catties of corn, benefiting more than 1,500 people.

　　烟台市电灯公司工人
  　英勇阻挠敌破坏阴谋
    【新华社华东二十四日电】重见天日的烟台工人，向记者诉述着他们的血泪史。烟台在去年被敌侵陷后，该市电灯公司即为敌爪牙徐传德控制。今年十月，两位工友被扣上“八路”帽子，惨遭活埋。另有五十余名职工被捕或遭开除。其余少数工人也于今年五月停电时被驱出厂。公司机器工具被匪军掠夺者达二百吨。敌人临逃走前，又将三部发电机破坏。最后该敌竟图把高低电压对调，毁灭全市电业设备。工人高绍玉等九人闻讯后，乃不顾敌抓丁危险，排除一切艰苦回到发电所藏起来，秘密看守机器，使敌人的破坏阴谋不能实现。七十多岁的老工人皮宗芳亦坚持在厂内看守，等待解放军到来。烟台解放，该厂二十多名工人立即参加复工建设，经十七天努力，已于十一月一日开始送电。
    该市码头工人，在敌占时亦为反抗国民党的迫害进行了英勇斗争。码头工人在人民政府时期所组织的铁工、渔行等八处合作社，于敌人侵占烟市后全被没收，并被劫去大小舢舨（即划子）四十余只，地板车（即以人力推拉的运货小车）百余辆。敌人更派了特务牟子东为码头职业工会总把头，专门负责镇压工人，强迫工人每天修工事、运军火。开始敌人还规定每人每日发工资十五万元蒋币，但牟子东却只发二万元，后来则一个钱也不发，却仍然要工人负担着户口、兵役、慰劳、保甲等捐税，迫使许多工人及其家属靠乞讨度日。今年春，工人为此发动了三天罢工，他们的口号是“宁可被打死也不被饿死”，结果获得相当胜利。今年五月，国民党海员党部又将码头工人集合起来，当场即将四百四十八名壮丁捕起编队。工人家属闻讯，发动了“索夫要子”的斗争。烟台解放，被抓的工人已大部跑了回来。人民政府以组织运输的办法，初步解决了失业工人的生活。全市共组织地板车一○三八辆，运粮五十七万四千斤，每车可赚玉米三十斤，得利者有一千五百余人。
