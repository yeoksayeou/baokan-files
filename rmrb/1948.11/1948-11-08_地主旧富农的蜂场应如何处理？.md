Inquiry and Answer

　　How should the bee farms of landlords and old rich peasants be handled? Answer to Geng Kuishan from Gengjia Village, Third District, Baixiang:

　　Bees raised or bee farms operated by landlords and rich peasants are within the scope of household sideline or handicraft industry and should not be considered feudal property. Therefore, when confiscating landlords' land property or requisitioning rich peasants' feudal property during land reform, the bee farms, which are non-feudal property, should be retained to allow them to continue operating. In your case, since your family is a rich peasant, the land property should be handled as that of a rich peasant. If your bee farm, as you say, has been developed entirely through your manual labor for more than ten years, then it should not be confiscated. Now that it is managed by your village's peasant association and has not yet been distributed, you can ask the local government to work with the masses in your village, clarify the policy, and return the bees.

　　地主旧富农的蜂场应如何处理？答柏乡三区耿家庄耿奎山：
    地主富农家中饲养之蜜蜂或经营之蜂场，是属于家庭副业或手工业范围，不能认为是封建财产。因此在土改中没收地主土地财产，或征收富农封建财产时，对非封建财产的蜂场则应予保留，让其继续经营。象你家的情况，家中既是富农，土地财产应按富农处理。你的蜂场，如果真如你所说，是十余年来完全靠你手工劳动发展起来的，那就不应没收。现在既由你村农会管理，尚未分配；可请当地政府协同你村群众，请明政策，将蜜蜂退还。
