The working classes of countries such as France, Japan, the United States, and Italy are launching struggles against domestic reactionary ruling classes.

The French coal miners' general strike of 350,000 people, fighting "for bread," has bravely entered its eighth week, despite all the repressive atrocities of the Queuille reactionary government. This sustained struggle of the French miners continues to receive support from the world's working class. Donations from miners in various parts of the Soviet Union to the French miners have reached over 26 million francs in the Asian part alone. Workers in Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Britain, the United States and other countries have also raised large sums of money to donate to them. On the 15th alone, the French miners' union received 45 million francs in donations. The atrocities of French Interior Minister Moch, who directed the police to shoot at demonstrators holding Armistice Day commemorations on the 11th and arrest French Communist Party members of parliament, have aroused angry protests from the French people. Workers in various industries in Paris held a 24-hour protest general strike on the 13th. The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a declaration calling on all French people to unite to protest against the government's atrocities and to oppose the government's reactionary policies of preparing the ground for de Gaulle to come to power and preparing for a new war.

Labor unrest in Japan is developing further. Hundreds of thousands of miners began a nationwide continuous 24-hour strike on the 10th to demand increased wages and improved safety equipment. 35,000 government employees held a protest demonstration on the 18th against the Yoshida Cabinet and the proposed anti-strike law. According to statistics from the Japan Federation of Industrial Labor Unions, one million workers are currently on strike, and 5.7 million workers are participating in the movement to demand increased wages.

While the strike struggle of 30,000 CIO seamen and dockworkers on the US West Coast has persisted for two and a half months, 65,000 AFL dockworkers on the US East Coast also began strikes one after another from the 9th, demanding increased wages. The strike has paralyzed shipping on the East and West Coasts of the United States, and the transport of Marshall Plan "aid to Europe" materials has also been suspended. According to the Associated Press, the number of ships currently out of service due to the strike has reached 647, accounting for more than one-half of the 1,200 merchant ships operating in the United States.

In addition, Italian workers have also launched strike struggles to oppose the reactionary faction's illegal wave of layoffs launched under the direct orders of the US "Marshall Plan" executive bureau. On the 15th, all mines held a 24-hour protest strike. Agricultural workers in the provinces of Florence, Pisa, Naples and other provinces are on strike to oppose the landowners' attempts to lay off workers.

On the other side of the world working class's united struggle, under Marshall's instruction, British trade unionist Lawther (Chairman of the British Trades Union Congress) instigated the Standing Committee of the TUC at its meeting on the 27th of last month to pass a reactionary resolution demanding that the World Federation of Trade Unions temporarily suspend its activities, otherwise the TUC would withdraw from the WFTU. However, this reactionary resolution cannot represent the sentiments of the broad masses of British workers. When the Standing Committee of the British TUC voted on this motion, there were 33 opponents. The Glasgow branch of the British Building Workers' Union has recently decided to reject this resolution, which is clear evidence of this. At the same time, Kuznetsov, Chairman of the Central Committee of Soviet Trade Unions, issued a statement denouncing the actions of the Standing Committee of the British TUC and confidently pointed out: "The WFTU must and will exist on the basis of the principles stipulated in its charter, because this is necessary for the interests of the working class all over the world." The French General Confederation of Labor also passed a resolution: "Determined to make the WFTU continue to exist and carry out its activities."

### 各国工人阶级团结斗争  反对国内反动统治势力

　　各国工人阶级团结斗争  反对国内反动统治势力
    法、日、美、意等国的工人阶级，正展开着反对国内反动统治阶级的斗争。
    法国三十五万煤矿工人“争面包”的总罢工，不顾葛义反动政府的一切镇压暴行，已英勇进入第八周。法国矿工这一持久的斗争，继续获得世界工人阶级的声援。苏联各地矿工寄给法国矿工的捐款，仅亚洲部分即达二千六百万法郎之上。波、保、匈、英、美等国工人，亦募集大宗捐款寄赠给他们。仅十五日一天内，法矿工工会就收到了四千五百万法郎的捐款。法内政部长摩许指挥警察枪击十一日举行休战纪念之示威游行者及逮捕法共议员的暴行，激起了法国人民愤怒的抗议运动。巴黎各业工人于十三日举行二十四小时抗议总罢工。法共政治局发表宣言，号召法国全体人民团结起来，抗议政府的暴行，反对政府为戴高乐上台准备基础和准备新战争的反动政策。
    日本的工潮正进一步发展中。为要求增加工资和改善安全设备，数十万矿工自十日起开始举行全国连续性的二十四小时罢工。政府机关三万五千职工于十八日举行了抗议性示威，反对吉田内阁及拟议中的反罢工法。据日本产业劳动组合联合会统计，正在罢工中的工人已达一百万，有五百七十万工人正参加要求增加工资的运动。
    当美国西岸三万产联海员与码头工人的罢工斗争已坚持两个半月的时候，美国东岸劳联的六万五千码头工人，亦于九日起先后举行罢工，要求增加工资。罢工已使美国东西两岸的航运陷于瘫痪，马歇尔计划“援欧”物资的运输，亦因而停顿。据合众社称，目前因罢工而停驶的船只已达六百四十七艘，即占美国全部行驶的一千二百艘商轮的二分之一以上。
    此外，意大利工人亦发动罢工斗争，以反对反动派在美国“马歇尔计划”执行局直接命令之下发动的非法的解雇浪潮。十五日，所有的矿场举行了二十四小时抗议罢工。佛罗伦萨、比萨、那不勒斯等省的农业工人，正进行罢工以反对地主的解雇企图。
    在世界工人阶级团结斗争的另一面，便是在马歇尔授意下，英国工贼劳瑟（英职工大会主席）策动该工会常委会于上月二十七日的会议上，通过了要求世界职工联盟暂时停止活动，否则该会即退出世界工联的反动决议。然而，这一反动决议决不能代表英国广大工人群众的情绪，英职工大会常委会在表决这一议案时，反对者即有三十三人，而英建筑工人工会格拉斯哥分会近已决定拒绝这一决议，便是明证。同时，苏联职工会中央委员会主席库兹涅佐夫发表谈话，斥责了英职工大会常委会的这一行为，并有信心地指出：“世界工联必须而且将要在其章程规定的原则的基础上存在，因为这是全世界工人阶级的利益所必需的。”法国总工会亦通过决议：“决心使世界工联继续存在并开展其活动。”
