　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: TASS Tokyo, 17th: The Japanese Communist Party's "Akahata" pointed out that the verdicts on the main Japanese war criminals showed that these military leaders were enemies of the nation. The newspaper emphasized that Japan would never achieve peace and democracy by merely executing Tojo and other major Japanese war criminals. "Akahata" demanded that the Emperor be held accountable. The newspaper pointed out that the members of the Democratic Liberal Party, who are trying to establish a military and fascist regime and are protecting and utilizing the Emperor system, are the political successors of Tojo and other war criminals. "Akahata" concluded by writing: The reactionary forces, who on the one hand pretend to be democrats and on the other hand are leading post-war Japan towards disaster, are openly launching a counter-offensive against people's democracy, peace, and independence in order to protect their own interests and power. The newspaper called on the working people to vigorously expose war criminals and to fight for the establishment of democracy and against all forces that attempt to lead the country towards war and fascism again.
