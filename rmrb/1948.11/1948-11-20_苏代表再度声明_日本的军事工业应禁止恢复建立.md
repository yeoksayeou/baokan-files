　　Soviet Representative Reiterates
  　Japan's Military Industry Should Be Prohibited from Re-establishment
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th】 TASS, New York: At the Far Eastern Commission meeting held on the 4th, Soviet representative Pan Youxin reiterated the Soviet delegation's proposal of September 23rd regarding the issue of Japan's industrial level—not to restrict Japan's civilian industry, but to prohibit the restoration and establishment of Japan's military industry. Pan Youxin stated: In determining the policy on Japan's economic level, the industrial issue is: along what path will Japan's industrial development proceed, and will the elimination of Japan's military industry be completed. The reason why Japan's industry served as the economic base for Japanese aggression in the past was not because its development reached a considerably high level, but because its development was subordinate to the needs of war. Regarding what should be considered military industry and what should be considered civilian industry, the Soviet delegation suggested taking the Far Eastern Commission's decision of August 18, 1947, as a starting point, which is recorded in the document on reducing Japan's industrial war potential. All enterprises listed as basic military industrial enterprises and secondary military industrial sectors in the aforementioned document should belong to the category of military industry. Industries called "auxiliary military industrial sectors" should only be allowed to maintain the extent necessary to meet Japan's civilian "non-military" needs. Other industrial sectors can be regarded as civilian industries.

　　苏代表再度声明
  　日本的军事工业　应禁止恢复建立
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社纽约讯：苏联代表潘友新于四日举行的远东委员会上，再度就日本工业水平问题，阐明苏联代表团于九月二十三日所提的建议——不限制日本民用工业，但禁止日本军事工业的恢复与建立。潘友新称：在决定日本经济水平的政策时，工业问题是：日本工业发展将沿着什么道路，日本军事工业的清除是否将予完成。日本工业过去之所以充当了日本侵略的经济基地，并不是因为其发展达到了相当高的水平，而是因为其发展是从属于战争需要。对于什么将被视为军事工业、什么将被视为民用工业，苏联代表团建议以一九四七年八月十八日远东委员会的决定为出发点，该决定记载在减缩日本工业的战争潜力的文件中。凡上述文件中称为基本军事工业企业及军事工业次要部门企业表，应属于军事工业之列。称为“辅助性的军事工业部门”的工业，仅应允许保有至可以满足日本民用“非军事性”需要所必需的程度。其他的工业部门，可以视为民用工业。
