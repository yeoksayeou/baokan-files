[Taiyuan Frontline News] Frontline photography reporters have created a type of photo leaflet poem card, which is distributed to companies for exhibition and circulation. It has played a significant role in boosting soldiers' morale, encouraging heroes and models, and spreading combat experience. For example, in the battles to annihilate the 44th and 45th divisions of the enemy around Taiyuan, and in the capture of Yan bandit division commanders Li Zifa and Zheng Jizhou, the reporters quickly produced cards after taking photos and distributed them to the companies. When the soldiers saw the photos of Li Zifa and Zheng Jizhou, they happily pointed and said, "Aren't these Yan Xishan's division commanders? Look, they've all been captured alive by us." Their enthusiasm for capturing prisoners grew even higher. Seeing the large number of mountain guns seized in the Xiaodian battle and the heroes riding on the cannons, the soldiers couldn't help but recite the following rhythmic lines: "We train well in peacetime, our combat skills are high in wartime, capture more prisoners and seize more cannons, comrades are all heroes." Then they began to argue about which cannon they had captured, and who would compete with whom next time to see who seized the most in the end. Seeing the photos of small group actions, individual blasting, cover and liaison, and mutual overcoming of enemy bunkers, some soldiers said, "I haven't had my picture taken in half my life. This time, even me and my actions are all photographed, and everyone can visit and learn from them. It's really an honor! I have to do a good job in the future." Some soldiers then said, "I also want to use this tactic and strive to be a model in the next battle, to be photographed, to see who gets photographed the most times." Seeing the photos of soldiers working hard without fear of difficulties, and the accompanying rhythmic words: "Do a good job when working, not afraid of planes or cannons, sweat more in peacetime, bleed less in wartime," they all said that this was their triple insurance and that they would act according to the photos. During the Jinzhong Campaign, some liberated soldiers did not believe that Xu Qichang (the commander of Yan bandit's 66th Division, who had twice escaped the PLA's net in the Shangdang Campaign) who was good at escaping, had also been captured alive by our army. But after seeing his photo, they completely believed it and immediately changed their tone, saying, "Look at his fat head and big ears, how could he escape our grasp." The method of making these cards is that the reporters first go deep into the companies for interviews, take timely photos of various vivid model facts of the troops in combat training, and write popular rhythmic words under the photos according to the content of the photos. Then, they are assembled into sets of small cards, which is considered a success. These cards are also very convenient to carry. When soldiers are resting, they can hang them on the wall for exhibition, and during wartime, they can be sent to the trenches for exhibition and circulation, which is very light and convenient. Now, various units are also increasing the number of photography cadres, purchasing photography equipment, and carrying out this work.

　　太原前线摄影记者新创造
  　像片传单卡片战士人人爱看
    【太原前线讯】前线摄影记者，制造了一种像片传单诗卡片，发到连队展览传阅，在提高士兵斗志鼓励英雄模范传播作战经验上，起了很大作用。如在太原外围歼敌四十四师、四十五师和活捉阎匪师长李子法、郑继周等战斗中，记者拍照后，很快就制成卡片，发到连队去，战士们看到李子法、郑继周的像片，都高兴的指着说：“这不是阎锡山的师长吗？你看一个个的都被咱们活捉了。”他们捉俘虏的情绪越发高涨。看至小店战斗缴获的大批山炮和骑在大炮上的英雄，战士不禁念起下边的快板来：“平时练兵练的好，战时打仗技术高，多捉俘虏多缴炮，同志们个个是英豪。”便纷纷争论起来，那门大炮是他们缴获的，下次要和谁比赛，看谁最后缴的多。看到小群动作单兵爆破掩护联络互相攻克敌碉的照片，有的战士说：“我半辈子没有照过像，这回连我和我的动作全照成像片啦，还让大家参观学习，真是光荣啊！今后可得好好干哩。”有的战士接着说：“俺也要用这战术，争取在下次战斗中当模范，照在像片上，看谁照的回数多。”看到战士不怕困难在工作时的照片和上边的板话：“在工作时做得好，不怕飞机不怕炮，平时多流汗，战时流血少。”都说这是他们的三保险，要照着像片去做。在晋中战役时，有的解放战士，不相信善于逃跑的徐其昌（阎匪六十六师师长，在上党战役中曾两次只身逃出解放军的罗网）也被我军活捉，但看到他的照片以后，就完全相信了，马上改变口气说：“看他那肥头大耳的样儿，还能跑出咱们的手心。”此种卡片的制法，先由记者深入连队采访，将部队在作战练兵当中各样生动模范事实，及时拍照下来，并在照片下面根据照片上的内容，写成通俗的板话，然后装成一套一套的小型卡片，就算成功。这种卡片携带也很方便，战士们在休息的时候，挂在墙上就可以展览，战时可以送到战壕，展览传阅都很轻便。现在各个部队也在增添摄影干部，购买摄影器材，开展此项工作。
