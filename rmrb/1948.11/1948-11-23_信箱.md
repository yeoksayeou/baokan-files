　　To the No. 1 Group of the No. 2 Branch of the North China Party School:
　　If a staff member dies from illness or drowning, they cannot be called a martyr, and their family should not be treated as a martyr's family. They can continue to receive the treatment of a worker's family. Only those who gloriously sacrifice themselves in battle or on official duty can be called martyrs, and their families can be treated as martyr's families to show preferential treatment.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Ministry of Civil Affairs)

　　To Comrade Yin Deliang, Pingshan:
　　After the land certificate is issued, if a buying and selling relationship occurs, both parties can, together with witnesses from the village, draw up a new agreement in accordance with village customs and register it with the county government, which will then be valid. The original land certificate does not need to be destroyed.
    After the families of martyrs have been provided with substitute farming for three to five years, if they still have no labor force and cannot maintain their lives through means such as renting out land or hiring labor, they can continue to request substitute farming according to the law until the masses believe they can farm and support themselves.

    华北党校二部二支一组：
    工作人员因病或淹死等，不能称为烈士，其家属亦不得按烈属待遇，可仍继续享受工属的待遇。参战或因公而光荣牺牲的，方得称为烈士，其家属才能按烈属待遇，以示优待。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（民政部）平山尹德亮同志：
    发了土地证以后，如有买卖关系发生，可由双方协同村中证明人等依照村中习惯订立新约，到县政府契备案，即为有效。原土地证也不必毁去。
    烈属代耕三年至五年后，如仍无劳动力，用出租、雇工换工等方式也不能维持其生活者，可依法继续请求代耕，至群众认为能自耕自给为止。
