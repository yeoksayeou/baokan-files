Xiaodian Town Battle

		Yu Ming, Liu Ping, Zhi Qian, Wei Ming

	A Certain Artillery Battalion

	It was at six o'clock on the fifth that the Yan bandit army, surrounded in Xiaodian Town, was desperately struggling. Guns and cannons roared wildly, but they did not realize that the fortifications of our certain artillery battalion had been completed and that we had already entered the position. "Boom! Boom!" Our mountain guns and heavy artillery began to fire. The gunners carried out various shooting actions calmly, just like they did in their usual studies. The Type 13 mountain guns that Yan bandits gave us in Jinzhong fired seven rounds, all of which hit, completely suppressing the enemy's firepower on the tall buildings. The enemy seemed to have been killed, not even firing a single shot. The infantry quickly rushed into the village, and the village battle of Xiaodian Town began.

	"If we can't break through there, we'll go there." Two heavy artillery guns proudly followed the infantry into the village. Although most of the gunners were new, their skills had improved remarkably after more than two months of training. The enemy was almost completely wiped out, but the firepower in the enemy's headquarters courtyard was revived. Six heavy artillery shells silenced them again. Especially the Type 94 mountain guns, immediately after entering, blasted two large holes in the brick house where the enemy was staying. The infantry also cooperated with blasting at the same time, and the enemy's headquarters courtyard was quickly occupied by us.

	Bloody Battle in Front of the Mountain Guns

	Wang Wenyu, the squad leader of the first squad of the eighth detachment, saw two mountain guns neatly set up in the middle of the street under the house. Opposite was the enemy division headquarters. The artillerymen had long disappeared. He quickly told the platoon leader. When the platoon leader heard that the mountain guns were right in front, he said urgently: "Squad One, jump down from the roof!" Everyone quickly climbed onto the houses, standing on the rooftops, which were more than two meters high.

	The enemy on the opposite house noticed and, in a temporarily built bunker, shot a row of hand grenades and a row of bullets at our roof. The roof was a flat roof, without even a little bit of shelter. However, we could not lose this roof. If we lost the roof, we would be suppressed in this courtyard by the enemy, unable to even breathe. Everyone acted together, quickly climbed down, and shot at the opposite side.

	The enemy's hand grenades exploded continuously, and the enemy's bullets whizzed over our heads. Yu Hebao was hit, and Wang Zhongrong was also hit. Squad leader Xu Zuoyi was wounded in the calf as soon as he entered the village, but he still insisted on rushing here with everyone. He was wounded again on his thigh, but he still insisted on throwing bombs and loading bullets to shoot at the enemy.

	This was a critical moment of severe war testing. Who would want to fail the test? Squad leader Xu Zuoyi, Zhang Sihe, and Wang Zhongrong had already submitted requests to the Party before the battle, hoping to become Communist Party members. Xu Zuoyi was a soldier from Chahar. He always remembered that his father had been forced to death by the collection of grain and money. At this time, he gritted his teeth, loaded a bullet, fired, and then loaded another bullet. He forgot that he was already wounded in two places. Just when he was wholeheartedly throwing another hand grenade, another piece of shrapnel hit his thigh. He looked down, did not hum, did not cry, quickly bandaged the wound, climbed down, and fought again.

	Of the eleven people on the entire roof, only Wang Kehai was completely unharmed. Deputy squad leader Wang Wenyu was also injured. He looked at everyone and shouted loudly: "Comrades, fight! We can't retreat!" No one spoke, just shooting and throwing bombs, as if no one paid attention to his words. Really, who would still want to retreat?

	Wang Kehai was a little devil who had just been liberated. In the past, he had never even thrown a hand grenade. At this time, he listened to the deputy squad leader constantly saying to him: "Wang Kehai, throw! Save the hand grenade pin!" Wang Kehai thought: "The squad leader is still afraid that I will be scared and throw the bomb without pulling the pin. Hmph, you just watch!" He put all the pins on his fingers, but in the end, he couldn't put them on anymore, so he threw them all at once.

	Wang Wenyu was hit on his right hand and could not throw bombs. He looked at everyone and thought: "I can't throw bombs, but I can still shoot." He pushed down the hemp bandage and started shooting with his uninjured index finger.

	When the hand grenades were gone, Wang Kehai said to the deputy squad leader: "Quick, hand grenades, I don't have any hand grenades." Originally, Wang Wenyu didn't have any hand grenades either, but he said loudly: "Give it, hand grenades, there are plenty." When Wang Kehai saw that his hands were empty, he immediately understood that the squad leader was deliberately shouting because he was afraid that the enemy would hear that we had no hand grenades. So, he didn't say anything.

	In the middle of the fighting, Xu Zuoyi, who had been wounded three times, was hit on the neck again. He looked down at the blood flowing straight from his neck and said to the deputy squad leader: "Deputy squad leader, I'm not going to make it, I've been hit in the intestines!" Wang Wenyu quickly bandaged him, saying: "No, comrade, can you still talk if you've been hit in the intestines?" Wang Wenyu then said loudly: "No, I can still fight, I still want to fight!" Then, he climbed down and fought again.

	Our hand grenades flew over, and the enemy's hand grenades flew over. Without fortifications, without shelter, a group of wounded people persisted for two hours. When the explosives blew open the wall and our people rushed into the division headquarters, they were still fighting. The enemy on the opposite roof slowly went from fierce to sparse, and finally, didn't fire a single shot.

	Capturing Li Zifa Alive

	The remaining enemies were still resisting, not knowing whether to live or die. The machine guns roared. The soldiers of the Fifth Company tensely prepared everything in the house, waiting for the explosives to explode, and then rushing from this side to the other side to finally eliminate the 44th Division headquarters and capture the division commander Li Zifa alive.

	Why hasn't it exploded yet! The soldiers were anxiously waiting. If it was any later, we wouldn't be able to grab this piece of fat! After a while, there was a loud bang, like a thunderclap. The soldiers were happy, and the joy encouraged everyone's courage. Under the pervasive smoke, the first and third platoons rushed eastward, and the second platoon rushed into the first courtyard west of the street. Five guys were preparing to flee to the fifth courtyard when they were caught by our brave soldiers, who seized their guns. The enemy was as scared as mice. After hearing the sound of the explosives, the enemies from the four courtyards on both sides squeezed into the fifth courtyard with their tails between their legs. Who knew that our brave soldiers quickly caught up. Ten people became spoils of victory again.

	The machine guns on the house were still struggling to fire. In the fifth courtyard, the enemy kept throwing hand grenades outside. We wanted to control the roof to solve the enemies in the last courtyard, but there was no ladder, and the enemy was blocking it, so we couldn't get through. The company commander vigilantly led the communication soldiers over. The second platoon deputy Zhai Huiquan and the ninth squad deputy Yang Chenggun also followed. They went through the first courtyard and secretly developed to the front of the fifth courtyard. Aiming at the two machine guns on the house, they threw a row of hand grenades without hesitation. The two machine guns on the house became mute. Two guys who stubbornly served Yan bandits were hit by bullets and were still struggling to breathe. They quickly seized these two machine guns, and the remaining enemies were driven off the house.

	At this time, the courtyard was quiet. Under the moonlight, it was seen that the room was crowded with darkness. The four of them divided into two groups, controlled the house, and launched a political offensive against the enemies in the room. The communication soldier shouted: "Those who surrender will not be killed!" The other people also kept shouting: "Come out and surrender and you will not be killed. Whoever doesn't come out will be killed." "Old chief, old chief, we surrender." Groups of prisoners came out of the house, put down their guns, and stood obediently in the courtyard.

	"Is there anyone else?" Our soldiers continued to shout. Comrade Yang Chenggun came down from the house. "Bang!" A shot went past his head and hit the ladder. This was the calculation of a die-hard enemy, who still wanted to continue to resist, but Comrade Yang Chenggun came down without hesitation. The enemies in the courtyard who had surrendered were frightened by his heroic spirit and shouted loudly: "Who is shooting! We have all surrendered our guns, what are we shooting for? Let him come down and kill you." Then Comrade Zhai Huiquan also came down, greeting the prisoners and shouting to the room: "Search!" At this time, Li Zifa, the commander of the 44th Division, and the deputy division commander, etc... crawled out of the room lifelessly.

	"What do you do?" The company commander pointed to a smartly dressed officer and asked. "I...I...am Li Zifa, the commander of the 44th Division." He said with a trembling voice, pleading to the company commander: "Please send me to your hospital, I'm hit in the stomach." The company commander said kindly: "I'll send you back right away."

	The soldiers' morale was extremely high. "He's caught!" "Ah! He is Li Zifa!" "He is the commander of the 44th Division!"... They pointed at Li Zifa's dejected posture, leading the prisoners back with a happy expression of completing a glorious task.

　　小店镇战斗
    禹明　刘平　志谦　未明
  　某炮兵大队
    这是在五号六点钟的时候，包围在小店镇的阎匪军，死命的挣扎，枪炮在疯狂的怒吼，但他却没有发觉我某炮兵大队的工事已做好，而且已经进入了阵地。“轰！轰！”我们的山炮和重炮开始了发射，炮手们象平时学习一样，不慌不忙的进行着各种射击动作。阎匪在晋中送给我们的一三式山炮，打了七发，全部命中，把高楼上敌人的火力完全压下去了，敌人好象都被打死一样，连一枪都不打了。步兵很迅速的冲进了村，小店镇的村落战便开始了。
    “那里打不开，我们去那里”，两门重炮很骄傲的随着步兵进了村。虽然大部炮手是新手，但经过了两个多月的练兵，技术惊人的提高了。敌人快全部消灭了，但敌人司令部院子里的火力又复活了，六发重炮又把他打的不出气了，特别是九四式山炮，刚刚进去就给敌人住的砖房子打了两个大窟窿，步兵也同时协同爆破，敌人司令部的院子就很快被我们攻占了。
    山炮前的血战
    八分队一小队一班副王文玉，在房上看见脚底下的街道中间，好端端的架着两门山炮，对面就是敌师部，炮兵们早不知躲到哪里去了，他就赶快告诉排长，排长听说山炮就在前面，他急的说：“一班上，从房上往下跳！”大家都一个一个迅速的爬上了房子，站到两丈来高的房顶上。
    对面房上的敌人发觉了，在暂时修成的暗碉里，后面一排手榴弹，一排子弹朝我们的房顶上打了过来，屋顶是坦平的平房，连一点点隐避的地方也没有，但是，我们也不能丢掉这座屋顶，丢掉了屋顶，就会被敌人把我们压在这座院子里，连气都喘不过来的，大家都一齐动作，迅速的爬下朝对面射击了。
    敌人的手榴弹连续的爆炸，敌人的子弹吱吱的在头顶上飞过，俞合保带彩了，王中荣也带彩了，小组长徐作义在刚进村小腿就带彩，他仍坚持着和大家一块突到这里来，他的大腿上又再一次负了伤，他仍坚持着投炸弹，推上子弹朝敌人打去。
    这就是严重的战争考验关头了，谁愿自己被考验不及格呢？小组长徐作义和张四和，王中荣早在战斗前，就向党提出了要求，希望成为一个共产党员，徐作义是察哈尔的战士，他时时记得父亲是叫逼粮要款逼死的，他这时咬着牙推上一颗子弹，一放，再推上一颗子弹；他忘记了自己已经是两处受伤的人了，就在他全心全意又投出一个手榴弹时候，又是一块炸弹皮，打进了他的大腿跟，他低头看一看，一声不哼、不叫，迅速的缠住伤口，爬下又打起来了。
    全屋顶十一个人，只剩下王科海一个人是全好无损的了，副班长王文玉也负伤了，他看着大家，大声的喊：“同志们，打，我们不能退！”大家谁也不说话，只是射击，投弹，好象谁也未注意他的话，真的，谁还会想退却呢？
    王科海，是才解放过来的一个小鬼，过去，连手榴弹也没打过，这时，他听着副班长在他跟前不住的说：“王科海，打，把手榴弹线保存下！”王科海心想：“班长还怕我害怕不拉线就投弹哩，哼，你看着吧！”他就把线都套在了指头上，但是，最后已经再也套不下了，他才一下扔了。
    王文玉是在右手上带彩的，不能投弹，他看着大家心里想：“我不能投弹，也要打枪”，就把麻带推下来，用着还没负伤的食指打起来了。
    手榴弹没有了，王科海朝副班长说：“快，手榴弹，我没有手榴弹了。”本来，王文玉也没手榴弹了，他却大声说：“给，手榴弹，有的是。”王科海一看他两手空空，心里立刻明白是班长怕敌人听见我们没了手榴弹而故意喊的，于是，他就不哼了。
    就在打的中间，负了三次伤的徐作义，脖子上又带彩了，他俯视着脖下直淌的血水，对副班长说：“副班长，我不行了，打着肠子了！”王文玉一面迅速给他缠绷带，一面说：“没有，同志，打着肠子你还能说话？”王文玉就又大声的说：“对，没有，我还能打，我还要打！”于是，他又爬下打起来了。
    我们的手榴弹打过去了，敌人的手榴弹打过来了，没有工事，没有隐避，一群伤员坚持了两个钟头，等炸药炸开墙，我们的人冲进师部，他们也还在打，对面屋上的敌人慢慢由激烈而稀疏，最后，一枪不发了。
    活捉李子发
    残余的敌人，还在不知死活的抵抗，机枪哒哒的吼叫着。五连的战士紧张地在屋子里把一切准备好了，单等炸药响后，便从这边冲到那边去，最后的消灭四十四师师部，活捉师长李子发。
    怎么还没有响呀！战士们早等的着急的不行了，要再迟点儿，我们就抢不到这块肥肉呀！不一会，轰的一声，象巨雷一样响了，战士们高兴起来了，愉快鼓起了大家的勇气，在弥漫的烟雾下，一、三排向东冲过去了，二排冲进了街西的第一座院子。五个家伙正准备往第五座院子逃窜，恰被我们的勇士赶到了，趁劲缴了枪。敌人象老鼠一样，害怕极了，一听见炸药响声之后，一边四座院子的敌人，夹着尾巴挤缩到第五座院子去，哪知我们神勇的战士，迅速的赶了上去，十个人又当了胜利品。
    房子上的机枪还挣扎的打着，第五座院子，敌人还一直往外边打手榴弹。我们想控制房顶，解决最后院子的敌人，但没梯子，敌人又封锁着，通不过去，连长机警地带着通讯员过去了，二排副翟会权、九班副杨成群也跟着过去了，他们从第一座院子过去，秘密地发展到第五座院子跟前，对准房子的两挺机枪，毫不犹豫地，一排手榴弹打过去了，房子上的两挺机枪成了哑子，为阎匪顽强效命的两个家伙中了弹，还在挣扎的喘气，他们迅速的夺了这两挺机枪，其余的敌人被赶下房子了。
    这时院子里已是悄悄地，从月光下，看见屋里黑压压的缩了一房。他们四个人，分成了两路，控制了房上，向屋子里的敌人展开了政治攻势，通讯员喊着：“缴枪不杀！”其他几个人也不断的喊着：“出来缴枪不杀，谁不出来就打死谁。”“老总，老总，我们缴枪”，一群一群的俘虏从房子里出来，放下了枪，规规矩矩站在院子里。
    “还有没有？”我们战士继续喊着。杨成群同志从房上下来了。“叭”一枪，从他头边过去，打到梯子上，这是死心塌地的敌人的暗算，还想继续的顽抗，但杨成群同志毫不犹豫地下来了，院子里缴了枪的敌人，被他这英勇的神气，吓的乱嚷着说：“谁打枪哩！咱们都缴了枪，还打啥哩，叫人家下来打死你。”接着翟会权同志也下来了，一面招呼着俘虏，又向屋子里喊着：“进行搜索！”这时四十四师师长李子发、和副师长等…………没精打彩的从屋里爬出来了。
    “你是干什么的？”连长指着一个穿着很阔气的军官问。“我………我………是四十四师师长李子发。”他带着抖颤的声音，向连长恳求说：“请你把我送到你们医院里，我肚子上挂彩了。”连长和气的说：“回去就送你去。”
    战士们的情绪高涨极了，“可捉住他了！”“啊！他就是李子发呀！”“他就是四十四师的师长！”………他们指着李子发颓丧的姿态，带着完成光荣任务的愉快的神情，领着俘虏回来了。
