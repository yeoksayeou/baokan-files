    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Front, 2nd. The Taiyuan front-line headquarters of our army has issued a serious warning to the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan bandit troops who released poison gas. On the 29th and 30th of last month, the Yan bandit troops continuously released large amounts of poison gas toward our Xiaoyaotou position in the east of the city. Because our army had taken precautions, the enemy's poisonous scheme did not achieve its purpose. Prior to this, on the evening of the 17th, the bandit troops released poison gas against our troops guarding Nanpingtou in the southeast of the city. More than 500 of our soldiers were poisoned. The poison gas was fired from artillery shells and was divided into two types: tear gas and sneeze gas. Fortunately, we gave timely treatment, and we did not suffer major harm. On the 18th, in the battle of Niutuozhai in the east of the city, the enemy released poison gas against us again. At the same time, the Yan bandits slanderously counterattacked, continuously issuing messages through the Kuomintang propaganda company, the Central News Agency, slandering our army for releasing poison gas. The Taiyuan front-line headquarters of the People's Liberation Army has formally warned the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan bandit troops who released poison gas that they must immediately stop this criminal act which violates international conventions and is devoid of humanity. Otherwise, on the day the city is captured, our army will severely investigate the responsibility for releasing poison gas, and the chief culprits will be severely punished as war criminals.

    太原蒋阎匪连续施放毒气
    我军发出严重警告
    如再放毒城破后必严惩首恶
    【新华社太原前线二日电】太原前线我军指挥部，顷对施放毒气的蒋阎匪军发出严重警告。阎匪军于上月二十九、三十两日连续向我城东小窑头阵地大肆放毒，由于我军已有预防，敌之毒计未达目的。在此以前，匪军曾于十七日黄昏，向我城东南南坪头守军放毒，我军中毒者达五百多人，其毒气由炮弹射发，分催泪性、喷嚏性两种；幸经我及时救治，未受大的伤害。十八日城东牛驼寨战斗，敌又对我放毒。与此同时，阎匪反血口喷人，经由国民党造谣公司中央社连续发出诬蔑我军放毒消息。人民解放军太原前线指挥部顷正式警告放毒的蒋阎匪军，必须立刻停止此种违犯国际公约毫无人性的罪恶行为，否则城破之日，我军必当严究放毒责任，对于首恶分子决按战争罪犯严惩不赞。
