　　The Northeast People's Liberation Army, in its autumn offensive, began a major campaign on September 12th, making a surprise attack on the Beining Railway. As soon as the troops moved out, they were victorious, capturing two cities in a row: Xingcheng and Suizhong. By the beginning of October, Yixian was captured, followed by Jinzhou, wiping out 120,000 enemy troops. The enemy's rear lines in the Northeast were thus cut off. Zeng Zesheng revolted, and Zheng Dongguo surrendered; without firing a shot, Changchun was liberated. Chiang Kai-shek panicked and flew to Shenyang three times, deciding on a general retreat, ordering Liao Yaoxiang: Run quickly, run quickly, or you will die. The bandit Liao led his troops, five main armies, left Shenyang, and hurriedly advanced westward, running to Dahushan, falling into a maze. They ran into the People's Liberation Army, with surprise soldiers descending from the sky, casting a dragnet. Chiang's bandits had nowhere to hide. A full five armies were wiped out at once. Our army turned around, focused on taking Shenyang; like a violent storm sweeping away fallen leaves, the outer strongholds were wiped out, and a general offensive was launched from all directions. Shenyang was quickly liberated. With the liberation of Shenyang, the Northeast was completely liberated; with the liberation of the Northeast, the whole country will be liberated even faster. The bandit Fu came south to offer himself to be killed, and took a big hit from us, hurriedly scurrying back, not daring to offend Shijiazhuang. The Northeast military and civilians support us, and we must work even harder; with the Northeast and North China combined, the people's power can turn the world upside down; Fu Zuoyi's entire system, Chiang Kai-shek's northern front, will probably be completely finished in just a few months, completely finished!

　　东北完全解放了　供黑板报用
    东北解放军，秋季大进攻，九月十二日，开始大动兵，奔袭北宁路，出兵就得胜，一连克两城，兴城和绥中。到了十月初，打下了义县，接着克锦州，歼敌十二万。东北敌后路，从此被截断。曾泽生起义，郑洞国投降；没有动刀枪，长春就解放。慌了蒋介石，三次飞沈阳，决定总退却，命令廖耀湘：快跑快快跑，不跑就死亡。廖匪带上兵，五个主力军，离开沈阳地，急忙向西进，跑到打虎山，陷进迷魂阵。碰上解放军，奇兵从天降，撒下天罗网，蒋匪无处藏，整整五个军，一下消灭光。我军回过头，一心拿沈阳；狂风暴雨卷落叶，外围据点一扫光，四面八方总进攻，沈阳迅速得解放。沈阳一解放，东北全解放；东北一解放，全国更快要解放。傅匪南犯来送死，挨了咱们一大棒，急急忙忙往回窜，不敢冒犯石家庄。东北军民支援咱，咱们更要加油干；东北华北加起来，人民力量能翻天；傅作义的全系统，蒋介石的北战线，大概只要几个月，通统就都要完蛋，通统就都要完蛋！
