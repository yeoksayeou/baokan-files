    The Landlord Counter-Offensive in Gaoqian Village
    Personnel from Shijiazhuang Tenth District Have Resolved the Issue

To the Editor:

We believe that the criticism and suggestions published on October 10 regarding the large-scale return of landlords in Gaoqian Village, Shijiazhuang Tenth District, are very accurate. We will now describe the course of events, the handling of the situation, and our district's self-criticism regarding this matter:

            I. The Course of Events

    Gaoqian Village is a village where landlords and rich peasants are concentrated, the class enemies are quite powerful, and it is a large market town and a station on the Beijing-Hankou Railway. The elements are very complex. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Second Civil Revolutionary War, it was also a gathering place for landlords who fled from Yuanshi and Luancheng. The reactionary forces in the village had a considerable foundation, and it was difficult to mobilize the masses. The Poor Peasants' League and the Peasants' Association formed during the land reform period were inseparable from the reactionary forces in the village, so the masses were never effectively mobilized.

    After the heavy rains this summer, some of the houses confiscated during the land reform leaked. With the private permission of the village cadres, some landlords and rich peasants moved back to their original houses (the houses in the village had not yet been distributed). At the end of August, district cadre Shen Ruihe announced at a village cadre meeting that "generally, landlords and rich peasants can temporarily move back if the masses do not object, but they are not allowed to drive out poor and hired peasants." However, he did not manage this work well and relied on three students from the village studying at Shijiazhuang Middle School to do it, while he himself left the village. In early September, a large number of landlords and rich peasants (Editor's note: Landlords and rich peasants must be clearly distinguished and treated differently. Landlords' houses should be completely confiscated and redistributed; rich peasants' houses should not be repeatedly allowed to be moved in and out, only their surplus houses should be requisitioned. The letter refers to landlords and rich peasants interchangeably without distinguishing them, which is inappropriate.) moved back into their own houses and drove out the poor household of Chen Erbai. Another three households were threatened and moved out voluntarily. Under these circumstances, more than twenty landlord and rich peasant families moved back.

            II. How Was the Matter Handled?

    After the district discovered this matter, most of the cadres were attending a meeting at the prefectural committee, leaving only the secretary of the district office as the main cadre. The district secretary once sent someone to consult the county committee, and the verbal reply was to immediately arrest the most reactionary landlords and resolve the issue. The district secretary then went to the village, convened a cadre meeting and a meeting with landlords and rich peasants, ordering the landlords and rich peasants who had moved in to move out again. He held this meeting but did not supervise its implementation and returned to the district, handing the matter over to two new cadres who had just been promoted from the village (both of whom are now hiding and cannot be found by district cadres). These two cadres did nothing at all, so the landlords and rich peasants still did not move out. It was not until the cadres returned from the meeting at the prefectural committee (September 14) that they discovered that this problem had not been resolved. However, the district did not seize the opportunity and held several more cadre meetings until the 18th, when they again sent someone to consult the county committee. The county committee replied that the matter must be firmly handled and the main culprits arrested. According to the instructions of the county committee, on the evening of the 18th, the district secretary personally went to the village, convened a cadre meeting and a small meeting of poor and hired peasants. The masses still had great fear and did not dare to stand up. Seeing this, the district committee convened a mass meeting on the 19th (market day), summoned all the landlords and rich peasants in the village, explained the policies, and pointed out that the landlord counter-offensive was an illegal act of defying the decrees of the democratic government. Landlords Du Niuzi and Du Jixiang were immediately detained; other reactionary landlords and rich peasants were formed into groups to reflect at home and immediately vacate houses for poor and hired peasants. At the same time, the three students from Shijiazhuang Middle School were found, their mistakes were pointed out, and they were asked to conduct self-criticism and reflection.

    After this meeting, the district felt that simply detaining one or two landlords could not solve the problem and that it was necessary to combine it with the rectification of the village organization. Therefore, relying on new core members, the masses were mobilized to oppose illegal acts such as cadres protecting landlords and embezzlement. A second mass meeting was held, several bad cadres were removed, and new activists were appointed. However, the landlords and rich peasants still delayed moving. After discussion by the masses, it was decided that the two landlords who had been detained were not the main reactionary forces, and that the main reactionary leader was Du Yinlin. Therefore, after education, Du Niuzi and Du Jixiang were released, and Du Yinlin was detained and sent to the Public Security Bureau. At this point, the landlords and rich peasants knew that they had to move. First, the four most reactionary households moved out. Because the troops occupied many houses, the other households could not find houses to live in for the time being and stayed in their own houses. Once they found houses, they would be allowed to move out. At this point, the masses dared to raise their heads.

            III. Our Self-Criticism

    1.  This village is a village with a considerable foundation of feudal forces. It is relatively difficult to carry out various tasks in the village. However, we did not have sufficient vigilance. The chairman and vice-chairman of the Peasants' Association were inseparable from the landlords and rich peasants, but the leadership always tolerated and did not adjust them. The two newly promoted cadres in the village embezzled and enriched themselves together with the chairman and vice-chairman of the Peasants' Association, so they naturally could not solve the problem. This shows that our class perspective is not clear enough.

    2.  In correcting deviations and repelling the counter-offensive of the landlords and rich peasants, we did not pay attention to mobilizing the masses and almost completely took over and did everything ourselves, only making arrangements at cadre meetings. After the incident occurred, the district secretary only made arrangements at a cadre meeting and did not mobilize the strength of the masses, so no results could be achieved.

    3.  The problem was not solved in a timely manner. It took more than twenty days from the occurrence of the incident to its resolution. It was not until after returning from several days of meetings that we went to solve it. There is bureaucracy in the leadership.

    4.  Contrary to the facts, a total of four poor and hired peasant households moved out this time. Chen Erbai was driven out by Du Yinlin's threats (not Du Jixiang), and the other three households were affected and moved out in fear. The poor and hired peasants were not largely driven out.

### 高迁村地主反攻问题  获鹿十区已派人解决

专栏：检讨与答覆

    高迁村地主反攻问题
    获鹿十区已派人解决编辑同志：
    十月十日报上所登载获鹿十区高迁村地主大还家的批评与建议，我们认为是很正确的，今将事情发生的经过与处理情形及我区对此问题的检讨，叙述于下：
            一、事情发生的经过
    高迁村是地富集中阶级敌人相当强大的村子，而且是个大集镇，又是平汉路上一个车站，分子也极复杂。抗战时期及二年解放战争中，又为元氏与栾城等地逃亡地主聚集的地方；反动力量在该村是有相当的基础的，群众很难发动。在土改时期，所组成的贫农团与农会，都与该村反动力量分不开，因此群众始终未很好发动起来。
    今年夏季大雨以后，土改中没收房子有些漏了；在该村干部私自许可下，有一部地主富农搬回原来的房子去住（该村房子尚未分），八月底区干部沈瑞和又在村干部会上宣布“一般地主富农如果群众不反对，可以暂时搬回，但不许撵走贫雇农”。但他并未很好掌握这一工作，而且把这事依靠给该村在石门中学上学的三个学生，他本人即离开该村。九月初，就有大批的地富（编者按：地主与富农必须划分清楚，并分别待遇，地主的房子应全部没收，再重新分配；富农的房子，不应反复让其搬进搬出，只能征收他多余房子。来信将地主富农称呼待遇混为一谈，未加分清，是不妥当的。）搬回自己的房子中，而且撵走贫户陈二白，另有三户被威胁自动搬出，在这样情形下，地富搬回共二十余家。
            二、事情怎样处理的？
    区里于发现此事后，因为大多数的干部到地委开会，主要干部只剩下区公所秘书，区秘书曾经派人请示县委口头答复，立刻征办最反动的地主并解决此问题。区秘书即到该村召开了干部会，与地富会议，叫搬进去的地富仍旧搬出，他开过此会但未督促实现即回区里，并把此事交给才从该村提拔出来的两个新干部去执行；（现在该二人都躲避不见区干部）而这两个干部根本未管，因此，地富仍旧没有搬出。直至干部都自地委开会回来（九月十四号），才发现此问题仍未处理。但区上也未抓紧，又开了几天干部会，直到十八号才又派人请示县委，县委答复要坚决处理并征办首要分子。根据县委指示，十八日晚，区书便亲到该村召开了干部会，与贫雇农小型会议；群众仍存有很大畏惧心理，不敢起来。区委见于此，又于十九号集市上，召开了群众大会，把该村地富都召集来，说明政策，并指出地富反攻是违抗民主政府法令的犯法行为，立即将地主杜牛子、杜吉祥二人扣押起来；把其他反动地富编成小组，回家进行反省，并立刻给贫雇农腾房子，同时找来石门中学三个学生，指出他们的错误让其进行检讨反省。
    此次会后，区里感觉光把一两个地富扣起来，仍不能解决问题，必须与整顿该村组织相结合。因此接着依靠新的骨干分子，发动群众反对干部包庇地主贪污等非法行为；又召开了第二次群众大会，撤了几个坏干部，补上新的积极分子，但是地富仍旧拖延不搬，又经过群众的讨论，认为先扣的两个地富，并不是反动势力中最主要分子，最主要的反动头子是杜银林，于是又经过教育释放了杜牛子、杜吉祥，将杜银林扣押送到公安局；一般地富至此才知道不搬不行，首先最反动的四户搬出，其他各户因为部队住了很多房子，一时找不出房子住，暂在本家住房，有了房子后即让其搬出，至此群众才敢抬头。
            三、我们的检讨
    一、该村是个封建势力有相当基础的村子，各种工作在该村进行都比较困难，但未有充分的警惕性，正副农会主席与地富分不开，但领导上始终姑息不加以调整，在该村的两个才提拔的干部都与农会正副主席共同贪污自肥，他自然更不能解决这个问题，说明我们阶级观点还不够明确。
    二、纠偏与打退地富的反攻，都没有注意到发动群众，几乎完全是包办代替，只在干部会上布置。事情发生后，区里秘书去解决也只是在干部会布置一下，而没有把群众的力量发动起来，以致不能收到效果。
    三、问题解决不及时，从事情发生到解决有二十多天。直到开了几天会回来，才去解决，领导上有官僚主义现象。
    四、与事实不符的，是此次贫雇农搬出来的共四户，陈二白是被杜银林威胁撵出（并非杜吉祥撵出），其他三户受到影响害怕搬出，贫雇农并没有大部被撵出。
