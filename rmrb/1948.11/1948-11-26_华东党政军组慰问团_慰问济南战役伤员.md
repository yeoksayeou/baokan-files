　　East China Party, Government, and Military Delegation
　　Visits Wounded Soldiers from the Jinan Campaign
    【Xinhua News Agency, East China, 23rd】The East China Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China, the East China Military Region, and the Shandong Provincial Government recently organized a delegation to visit various hospitals, representing the entire Party, government, military, and people of the East China region to express their regards to the wounded soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who were gloriously injured in the Jinan Campaign. The East China Military Region Political Department band and film team also accompanied them. After arriving at the hospitals, they were divided into groups to visit various sanatoriums and wards, and showed films to express their appreciation. The wounded soldiers were extremely excited and expressed their determination to recuperate with peace of mind, heal their wounds as soon as possible, and return to the front lines quickly. Because they had undergone the new-style military rectification movement, their class consciousness had greatly improved. Therefore, during their recuperation, they not only obeyed the organization, observed hospital rules and various systems, but also seized the time to carry out political and cultural studies, and actively participated in organizational life, the management and education of the wounded soldiers, and other tasks.

　　华东党政军组慰问团
  　慰问济南战役伤员
    【新华社华东二十三日电】中共华东中央局，华东军区和山东省政府日前特组织慰问团赴各医院，代表华东地区全体党政军民慰问攻克济南战役中光荣负伤的解放军伤员。华东军区政治部乐队和电影队亦随行。他们到达各医院后，即分组到各疗养所，各病室慰问，并放映影片慰劳。伤员们极为兴奋，纷纷表示安心休养，使伤口早日痊愈，快些回前方。他们由于经过了新式整军运动，阶级觉悟均大为提高，因而在休养中不但做到服从组织，遵守院规及各种制度，并且还抓紧时间进行政治文化学习，和积极参加组织生活，伤员的管理教育等各项工作。
