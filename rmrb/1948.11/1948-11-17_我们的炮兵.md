　　Our Artillery
　　Geng Xi
　　An old Red Army soldier told me: Ten years ago, in the early days of the Red Army, we had very few artillery pieces, and they were captured from the enemy. Because the cannons were too old and the caliber was too loose, they always made a "lao shi de" sound during battles, which was very unpleasant, and we also had very few shells. Recently, I visited a heroic artillery unit of the First Corps of the North China Field Army. The scale of their artillery is now incomparable to what it used to be. After several heroic and fierce battles and the successive liberation of the two strong fortresses of Yuncheng and Linfen, they have captured countless cannons from the enemy in the continuous victories in Jinzhong. Combined with the products of the Liberated Area's arsenals, they have built a modern and powerful artillery force.

　　Linfen City had never been breached in over 300 years since Li Zicheng's revolution at the end of the Ming Dynasty (When the Japanese army attacked, the defending troops fled in panic, and the city fell without a fight.). The city wall was snail-shaped and four zhang wide (about 13 meters), wide enough for two cars to pass side by side. It was also blasted open by our artillery fire and explosives. The city wall of Qi County, which was more than two zhang wide, was breached by us with a large opening in one and a half hours, allowing several units to break in simultaneously, which was faster than climbing the walls with ladders as before. The enemy's so-called "King Kong Ridge," with cement and reinforced concrete bunkers on White Lion Ridge, was stormed by our infantry after more than an hour of bombardment.

　　The masses in Jinzhong have a fair evaluation of the power of our artillery. After the Linfen-Jinzhong campaign, they not only looked forward to our victory, but also prayed day and night that their sons and brothers, who had been conscripted into the army by the Yan bandit, would quickly become our prisoners, fearing that they would be killed or injured by our artillery fire.

　　Needless to say about the Yan bandit officers and soldiers, even their last trump card, the Japanese officers who were good at artillery, had to admit defeat and praised our sharpshooters. After being captured, whenever they saw our comrades, they would give a thumbs up and say:
　　"Your artillery is good! Your artillery is better than ours."

　　The vast majority of our artillerymen were originally liberated peasants after the land reform. Their skills were learned and mastered in constant combat, on-the-job training on the battlefield, and through the educational policy of officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and the mass line during combat intervals. They proposed to dig up the old roots of Yan Xishan. Before the battle, they only studied for six weeks. They said: It is not easy to have the opportunity to study in the national liberation war. When the field artillery company was learning about artillery, because of the war mission, the artillery had not yet been delivered, so they only borrowed one howitzer. There were too many people, not enough to use. Liu Junyi, the deputy platoon leader of the third platoon, came up with a solution: using a large cart to replace the wheels, a broom to replace the sight, a thick wooden pillar as the gun body, a damper to replace the shield, and tearing paper as the aiming hole, and using a pestle as a shell. That's how they started. However, even in such circumstances, the soldiers' enthusiasm for learning did not diminish. In order to calculate the mil (a unit of measurement on the gun to correct deviations) and measure the distance, they desperately learned arithmetic. Houses and courtyards of all sizes were filled with Arabic numerals drawn in charcoal. Illiteracy was eliminated in three weeks. In six weeks, the soldiers from peasant backgrounds who were generally illiterate had learned addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The soldiers pulled the squad leader and said, "You must teach us well, don't wait until it's too late when we get to the fortifications." From setting up the guns and walking, to digging fortifications and firing, everything was trained in combat. As soon as they stopped firing, they blocked the firing holes and started learning. The enemy's shells were still exploding around their artillery positions, but they didn't care, as if nothing was happening. The new artillerymen who had never seen artillery before, now, after combat training, each squad had four or five people who could fire. The time was only two or three months. According to a liberated soldier who had been an old artilleryman in the Chiang army for seven or eight years, this would take two or three years in the Kuomintang army.

　　After such hard study and training, the field artillery soldiers hit the target with the first shot in the first shooting of the ×× campaign, followed by twenty-six shells hitting the target. In the second shot of twenty-one shells, only five shells missed the target. The infantry said: Today the artillery is good, quickly destroying the enemy's fortifications and gun emplacements. The laborers said: Today the artillery is good, the enemy doesn't even dare to shout. When will you fire again, we will come and help you pull the guns. Wang Yuxiang's gun was a hundred percent accurate. His first shot overturned the door panel buried on top of the enemy's fortifications. When attacking Bunker No. 6 in Linfen, they couldn't see at night. They studied the method of night shooting and overturned the enemy's door panel again with two shots. They studied every time they fired a shell, and they would worry if they missed by a few meters.

　　We also have a kind of artillery with great power. The shells it fires penetrate one or two meters into the enemy's fortifications before exploding. The soldiers like it very much. They affectionately call it the "Fat Baby" cannon, because it is chubby and looks like a fat baby. As soon as they see this kind of cannon, they pat their chests and say: With the "Fat Baby" cannon cooperating today, we are sure to take it down.

　　The enemy is also most afraid of our "Fat Baby" cannon. The prisoners said: "I don't know what kind of cannon it is. If you say it is a mortar, it shoots flat. I don't know where it came from. A large pile comes at once, and there is nowhere to hide. As soon as the shell explodes, when you open your eyes, you see your infantry's bayonets in front of you."

　　Among our artillerymen, not only the soldiers in the liberated areas are brave and calm, but also many liberated soldiers are our artillery heroes.

　　The soldiers of the third cannon of the × Field Artillery Company were only liberated in the ×× Campaign. After the Yuncheng Campaign, after telling them about being conscripted, being abused, and the suffering of their families being bullied, they understood that this was their own team. When changing into our military uniforms, gunner Zhang Duanfang said: "No need to change. Let them see us liberated soldiers turn our minds and fight them in these military uniforms."

　　After we explained to the soldiers that the cost of manufacturing an 82mm shell was equivalent to more than two hundred kilograms of millet, they proposed that they would rather be slower than let the shells go to waste. Every time they fired a shell, they had to take a look after it exploded, and they had to be responsible to the people for every shell. When attacking Linfen, several shells were not accurate. They studied it and found that the soil under the wheels was hard on one side and soft on the other. After firing a few shells, it became uneven. The second gunner, Zhang Deren, and everyone came up with a solution. After repairing it, they filled it with a wooden board. After firing a few shells, they found that the door panel was jumping too much and it was not easy to hit the target. They removed the door panel and replaced it with a mat and a straw mat before they hit the target. It was precisely because of their high sense of responsibility and enthusiastic research that his cannon was very accurate. Zhang Duanfang told me: In the past, in the Chiang bandit army, as long as a shell caused casualties within thirty to fifty meters, it was called a hit, but here, we have to hit the enemy's artillery positions, fortifications, and machine gun fortifications, and completely destroy the enemy, to be considered a hit. They can now hit wherever they point. Within a few hundred meters, three shells are guaranteed to drill into any firepower point and send the enemy back to their hometown.

　　我们的炮兵
    耿西
    一个红军时代的老战士告我说：十年以前的红军时代，开头我们只有极少的炮，并且是从敌人那里缴来的，因炮太老，口径太松，打起仗来，老是的，很不好听，而且炮弹也很少。日前，我去访问了华北野战军第一兵团英勇的炮兵某部，就他们炮兵规模的强大，已和从前不能相比了。他们经过历次英勇激烈的斗争和连续解放运城、临汾两大坚固堡垒之后，又在晋中连战连捷，从敌人手里夺取来的无数大炮，加上解放区兵工厂的出品，已建设成为近代强大的炮兵。
    临汾城自明末李自成革命起，三百多年从未被攻开过（日军进攻的时候，守军望风而逃，该城曾不攻自破。），城墙是蜗牛式的，四丈来宽，可以通过两辆汽车，也被我们的炮火和炸药轰开了，祁县二丈多宽的城墙，我们一个半钟头，便轰开了个大口子，使数路部队同时突入，这样就较以前竖梯登城更为迅速了。敌人号称“金钢岭”，筑有水泥钢筋碉堡的白狮岭，经过一个多钟头的轰击以后，我们步兵便冲进去了。
    我们炮兵的威力，晋中的群众有公平的评价。经过临汾晋中战役以后，他们不独盼望着我们胜利，而且日夜盼祷他们被阎匪抓去当兵的子弟赶快当我们的俘虏，担心着被我们的炮火杀伤了。
    阎匪军官兵是不用说了，就连他们最后的王牌，善于打炮的日本军官也不得不甘拜下风，称赞我们的神炮手。他们被俘以后，每见到我们的同志，便伸着大姆指说：
    “你们的炮兵打得好！你们炮兵比我们还打得好的。”
    我们的炮兵，绝大部分原是土改后的翻身农民。他们的技术是在不断的战斗中战场练兵中，战斗空隙中的官教兵兵教官群众路线的教育方针下学会和熟练的。他们提出要刨阎锡山的老根。作战前，只学习了六个星期，他们说：在全国解放战争中能有学习机会是不容易的。野炮连学炮的时候，因为战争任务，炮还未赶送上来，只借来一门榴弹炮，人太多，不够用，三排副刘均义想出了办法：用大车代替车轮，扫帚代替瞄准器，用碗口粗的大木柱当炮身，用风门代替护板，撕了纸当瞄准孔，用棒捶当炮弹，就这样便干起来了。但是，就在这样的情况下，战士们的学习情绪毫不低落，为了计算米位（炮上纠正偏差的一种单位名称）测量距离，他们拼命的学算术，多大的房院，都用木炭画满了阿拉伯字，三个星期便消灭了文盲。六个星期一般不识字的农民出身的战士都学会加减乘了。战士们拉着班长说：“可要好好教我们呀，不要等到了工事里便迟了”。从架炮走路，到挖工事、发射都是在战斗中锻炼出来的，一不发射了他们便堵好射口学起来了，敌人的炮弹还在他们炮阵地的前后左右爆炸着，他们也不管，象是根本就没有那么回事，开始没有见过炮的新炮兵战士，现在经过战斗的锻炼，每个班都有四、五个人能发射了，时间只有两三个月。据解放战士中在蒋军里干了七八年的老炮兵告诉我：在国民党的军队里，这必须是两三年才能办到的事。
    经过这样苦学苦练的野炮战士们，在××战役第一次射击中，第一炮即命中了，跟着二十六发炮弹都命中了，第二次廿一发炮弹，只有五发没有命中，步兵说：今天的炮打得好，很快地摧毁了敌人工事和枪眼，民工们说：今天的炮打得好，敌人话也不敢喊了，你们什么时候再打，我们来帮你们拉炮。王玉祥那门炮是百发百中的，他第一炮就把敌人工事顶上埋的门板都打翻过来。在临汾打六号碉，黑夜里看不见，他们研究了夜间射击办法，两炮又把敌人的门板都翻过来了。他们每打一发弹都要研究，打差了几公尺就要着急的。
    我们还有一种炮，威力强大，打出的炮弹钻进敌人工事一两公尺以后才爆炸，战士们非常喜欢它。他们就亲热的叫它是“胖娃娃”炮，因为它胖胖的很象个胖娃娃，一看到这种炮，他们便把胸膛一拍说：今天有“胖娃娃”炮配合，保险攻下来。
    敌人也最害怕我们的“胖娃娃”炮，俘虏说：“也不知道是什么炮，说它是迫击炮吧，却平平的射过来了，也不知道从什么地方发下来，这家伙一来一大堆，躲也无处躲，赶炮弹一爆炸，睁开眼睛一看，你们步兵的刺刀就放在面前了。”
    在我们的炮兵之中，不独解放区的战士是英勇沉着的，许多的解放战士，都是我们的炮兵英雄。
    野炮×连三炮的战士是××战役才解放过来的，经过运城战役，诉了他们被抓兵、自己被虐待、家庭被欺悔的苦以后，他们明白这里是他们自己的队伍，换咱们的军衣时，炮手张端方说：“不用换了，就我们这一身军衣，让他们看看，我们这些解放战士脑筋转过来打他们了。”
    我们给战士们讲解了制造一颗八二炮弹的代价等于二百余斤小米以后，他们提出宁叫慢一些不叫跑走，他们打出每颗炮弹爆炸了都要看一看，每颗炮弹都要为人民负责任。打临汾的时候有几炮没有打准，他们便研究了，原来是车轮下面的土，一边硬，一边软，打了几炮便高低不平了，二炮手张德仁和大家想出了办法，修平以后又填了块木板，打了几炮，他们又发现门板跳动太厉害，不易打准，把门板撤了，换成席子，草垫子，才打准了。正由于他们这种高度责任心和热心的钻研，于是，他这门炮便非常准确了。张端方告诉我：从前，他们在蒋匪军里，一颗炮弹打出去，只要三五十米以内有所杀伤便叫做命中，而我们这里都硬是要打到敌人炮兵阵地工事机枪工事里，彻底毁灭了敌人，才能算作命中的。他们现在已经是指到哪里打到哪里，几百公尺以内，三颗炮弹保险钻进任何火力点，送敌人回老家。
