　　People of the Pingjinbao Triangle Area
  　Resolutely Resist Fu Bandit's Tyranny
    [Jizhong Electric] Fu bandit Zuoyi and Wang bandit Fenggang have implemented a brutal tyranny of forced conscription, extortion, looting, rape, arson, and murder in the Pingjinbao triangle area, inflicting immense disasters on the people. The people are resolutely resisting the tyranny of the Fu and Wang bandits, and urgently hope to be liberated quickly. The villages under the rule of the Fu and Wang bandit gangs bear extremely heavy burdens, with some paying more in taxes per mu of land per year than they earn in a year. For example, in Nantong Village, Rongcheng County, from the first month to the fourth day of the fifth month, the entire village paid an average of more than 149 jin of corn per person; in Yang Village, within ten months, each mu of land paid 220 jin of corn, more than half of the harvest. This autumn, Chiang bandit also forcibly levied an additional 15 jin of "farmland tax" per mu in Jinwu County, 12 jin of "green grain," 30 jin of "temple field association grain," as well as "township grain" and "county grain," etc. The Fu and Wang bandit troops also extort arbitrarily. For example, the bandit troops stationed in Yang Village, Rongcheng County, demanded half a bolt of cloth for each gun to clean it. The pseudo-chief of Yang Village, surnamed Yang, grabbed and sold able-bodied men, grabbing 21 people from Yang Village alone in three instances, and selling them to nearby villages. Bandit troops in various places also constantly rob grain and loot villages. During the wheat harvest this year, almost all the harvested wheat of Zhengjiayao in Yongqing Twelve Households was robbed. Eight villages including Houhao Village had more than 100 carts of goods stolen in three days. The "tax collection office" set up by the bandit troops at Nanzhakou on the Jinpu Railway openly inspects taxes but secretly loots, and even rapes passing women.
    The Fu and Wang bandit troops are also frantically grabbing men everywhere. In the past year, they have arrested more than 10,000 young adults, some of whom were redeemed with grain, and some have already escaped. Shengfang City alone had more than 1,500 people seized by the Chiang bandits. In a village in Xiong County with more than 600 households, 121 young adults were seized.
    Wang bandit Fenggang is inhuman and has carried out massacres of innocent people. In the past year, about 1,000 people have been killed in the Pingjinbao triangle area. Since Xingu County was occupied by the Wang bandit troops last year, about 500 village cadres and people have been killed. Wang Baochun and his wife in Xiaoshasheng Village were buried alive by the bandit troops, and their three children, all under the age of ten, were cut in half, and a family of five died tragically.
    The inhumane Fu and Wang bandit troops rape and defile young women everywhere. The twenty-something daughter of a Fan family in Dashen Village, Jinwu County, was gang-raped by eight bandit troops in the field. In May, the Fu and Wang bandit troops stationed in Xisizhuang, drove all the men in the village into a large courtyard and locked them up, and raped all the women in the village.
    The heinous crimes of the Fu and Wang bandit gangs have not frightened the people north of the Daqing River, and the people have not succumbed. Sun Kaidao, Liu Lianzhong, and others who were seized from a village in Anci County, were threatened by the Wang bandit troops with a guillotine to force them to become soldiers, but they refused and cursed, "Chop! Your grandfather would rather die than be a soldier, your grandfather is against Chiang Kai-shek!" A village cadre surnamed Li in Xingu County was force-fed cold water and bamboo splints after being captured, but did not reveal a single secret. Before being killed, Yang Lao Zheng's father in Wangchu Village on the bank of the Juma River witnessed his entire family of eight being killed. His eyes turned red with anger, and he cursed, "You bunch of traitors and bandits, if you kill me, the Eighth Route Army will avenge me, I will fight you to the death!" and picked up a large pickaxe and smashed a bandit troop to death. The captured young adults were unwilling to sell their lives for Wang bandit Fenggang and fled back one after another. In Xisizhuang near the Juma River, six of the ten young people who were seized ran back in nine days. Wu Tingliang, Qi Futian, Liu Enxiang, and others in a village in Xingu County realized that only through struggle could there be a way out, and automatically joined the armed work team to avenge the dead. The people north of the Daqing River, the youth in each village organized militia, and many districts organized armed work teams to cooperate with local armed forces to strike at the enemy. During the wheat and autumn harvests, they carried out village-to-village joint defense to prevent Wang bandits from robbing grain. They repelled the enemy several times. The Anxin militia buried landmines at various important intersections during the wheat harvest. This autumn, the Fu bandits in Jinxi came out to rob the autumn harvest, and dozens of villages organized flying demolition teams and drove away the enemy. This autumn, the militia in the Second District of Jinwu County repelled Chiang bandit secret agents nine times and rescued the captured village cadres. The armed work teams they organized have become increasingly strong. For example, they won victories in the battles of Suqiao, Zhonggang, and Guangang, and rescued more than 40 captured young adults. In the Anheji battle, they cooperated with the local forces and annihilated 71 enemies in just ten minutes. The armed work team captured 35 by themselves, and they suffered no casualties. In the first half of the year, they fought 50 battles of various sizes, captured 22 blockhouses, and annihilated 102 enemies.
    In the past year of arduous struggle, the people north of the Daqing River have been looking forward to the People's Liberation Army day and night. In September, when the People's Liberation Army was stationed overnight in Zhouguanying Village, Xushui, an old landlady heard that the People's Liberation Army had arrived and hurriedly opened the door, saying, "Amitabha, you have finally come! The sky is clear now!" and started boiling water for the People's Liberation Army. This October, when the people heard the news of the People's Liberation Army's arrival, they rejoiced and talked about it. A middle peasant in Xixinzhuang, Ba County, said, "These days I am as happy as if I had taken Shunqi Dan." An old woman in Dongda Village, Xiong County, heard that the People's Liberation Army had surrounded the Wang bandits in Banjiawo and prayed while burning incense, "Bless the Eighth Route Army to win the victory, let no one be injured or killed, and kill all the white necks (referring to the Wang bandit troops)!" After the People's Liberation Army annihilated a brigade of Wang bandits, the people north of the Daqing River were encouraged and rejoiced. The masses in various villages have complained to the People's Liberation Army about the heinous crimes of the Fu and Wang bandit troops, and they demand that the People's Liberation Army capture Fu Zuoyi and Wang Fenggang alive, and completely liberate the Pingjinbao triangle area.

　　平津保三角地区人民
  　顽强反抗傅匪暴政
    【冀中电】傅匪作义及王匪凤岗在平、津、保三角地区，施行了强征、暴敛，抓丁抢掠，奸淫烧杀的暴政，给予人民莫大灾难。人民顽强反抗傅、王匪暴政，亟盼迅速获得解放。因傅、王匪帮统治的村庄，负担奇重，有的每亩地全年负担，比一年收成还多。如容城县南佟村，从正月到五月初四，全村每人平均纳玉米一百四十九斤多；杨村十个月内，每亩地合纳玉米二百廿斤，比收成多一半。今秋蒋匪又在津武县强征每亩十五斤的“田赋附加”，十二斤“青粮”，卅斤“庙田会粮”，还有“乡粮”和“县粮”等等费用。傅、王匪军并任意勒索，如驻容城县杨村匪军到村每支枪要半匹布擦枪。驻该村的伪大乡长杨某抓卖壮丁，只在杨村就抓了三次廿一人，卖给附近村庄。各地匪军还不断到村抢粮、劫盗，今年麦收时，永清十二户的郑家窑，把收的麦子几乎全被抢完。后好等八个村，三天被抢一百多车。匪军在津浦路南闸口设的“税收处”，明里验税，暗中行劫，甚至强奸过往妇女。
    傅、王匪军并到处疯狂抓丁。一年来，约计抓捕青壮年一万人以上，其中有的以粮赎回，有的已逃回。只胜芳市即被蒋匪抓走一千五百余人。雄县某村六百余户，被抓青壮年到一百二十一人。
    王匪凤岗残无人道，大施屠杀无辜群众。一年来平、津、保三角地区被杀群众，约在一千人以上。新固县自去年被王匪军侵占后，被杀村干部及群众约五百余人。小沙盛村王保春夫妇俩被匪军活埋，三个不满十岁的小孩子都被劈两半，一家五口惨死。
    灭绝人性的傅、王匪军，到处奸淫污辱青年妇女。津武县大沈村范某家二十多岁的闺女，被八个匪军拉在野地里轮奸了。五月间，傅、王匪军宿在西四庄，把全村男的赶到一个大院里，关闭起来，强奸了全村妇女。
    傅、王匪帮的滔天罪行，并没有吓住大清河北的人民，人民并没屈服。安次县某村被抓去的孙开刀、刘连仲等，王匪军摆了铡刀威胁他们当兵，他们不肯，反骂道：“铡吧！爷爷死了也不当，爷爷就是反对蒋介石！”新固县某村干部李某，被抓去后灌了凉水、钉竹签子，也没暴露一字秘密。拒马河岸边的王储村杨老正之父在被杀前，目睹自己全家八口完全被杀，气红了眼，破口大骂：“你们这伙子汉奸土匪，你杀了俺，八路军会给俺报仇的，我和你们拼了这条老命。”并搬起大镐，把一个匪军砸死。被抓走的青壮年，不甘心给王匪凤岗卖命，纷纷逃回。拒马河附近的西四庄，被抓走的十个青年，九天中跑回了六个。新固县某村吴挺良、齐福田，刘恩祥等，认识到只有斗争，才有生路，自动的参加了武工队，为死者报仇。大清河北的人民，各村青年组织起了民兵，不少的区组织了武工队，配合地方武装打击敌人。在麦收秋收时，他们即村村联防，不让王匪抢粮。曾几次的把敌人打了回去。安新民兵在麦收时，在各要道口，埋了地雷。今秋津西傅匪，出来抢秋，几十个村组织了飞行爆炸组，打跑了敌人。津武县二区民兵，今秋九次打跑蒋匪特务窜扰，并抢救了被抓走的村干部。他们组织的武工队，已日益坚强。如在苏桥、中岗、官岗战斗中，打了胜仗，并抢下了被抓去的四十多个青壮年。岸河集战斗中，配合地方式装，只十分钟，歼灭了七十一个敌人，武工队单独捉了三十五个，他们一无伤亡。在上半年中，作战大小五十次，拿碉二十二座，歼敌一零二人。
    在过去一年多的艰苦战斗中，大清河北的人民，日日夜夜盼望着解放军，九月间解放军夜驻徐水周管营村，一位房东老大娘，听到解放军来了，忙开开门，一边说着“阿弥托佛，你们可来了！这可晴了天了。”就给解放军烧水。今年十月，人民听到解放军来的消息后，纷纷欢欣谈论。霸县西辛庄中农说：“这几天我欢喜的和吃了顺气丹似的。”雄县东大村一位老大娘，听到解放军包围了板家窝的王匪，烧香磕头的祷告：“保佑着八路军打胜了，一个别伤亡，把白脖们（指王匪军）都打死！”解放军歼灭王匪一旅后，大清河北人民，鼓舞欢腾。各村群众纷纷向解放军控诉傅王匪军的滔天罪行，他们要求解放军活捉傅作义、王凤岗，全部解放平津保三角地区。
