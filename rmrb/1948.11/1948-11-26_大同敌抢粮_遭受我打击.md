　　【North Yue Electric】The 38th Division, 1st and 2nd Regiments, and the 2nd and 20th Security Regiments of the Datong bandits, combined with the fleeing local bandits from the eastern Datong and Yanggao districts and villages, totaling about 3,000 troops, launched a sneak attack eastward along the Ping绥 Railway in November to seize grain.

　　When the people of eastern Datong discovered the Yan bandit's attempt to seize grain, under the leadership of district and village cadres, women, children, the elderly, and the disabled from villages along the main road such as Fifty Mile Shop, Yujiashan, Shangzhuang, and East and West Yangfang, as well as livestock and anything they could carry, were transferred to the mountains. The militia and young adults stayed in the villages, laid landmines, and prepared to strike the grain-grabbing bandits. The enemy arrived in the villages and found no one, no food to eat, no water to drink, and nothing to loot, only landmines and sniper fire. In Shangzhuang, the enemy set off four landmines in less than two hours, wounding two. As soon as the enemy left the village, the militia killed a special agent with sniper fire. Julebao used the same method to kill a special agent. The bandits walked through the wilderness, jumped over walls when entering courtyards, and dared not act in groups of two or three. They even thought of capturing civilians on the hillside, but were struck by the militia using favorable terrain. Yingjudun, five miles from Julebao, repelled three attacks from enemies several times its size, wounding one enemy soldier. The enemy finally dared not venture deep into the mountains. Only in Fifty Mile Shop and Shangzhuang, more than ten houses and countless firewood were burned. The women in Wulitai who did not evacuate had most of their cotton trousers taken off by the bandits. A woman surnamed Wu from Wu Jiawa was captured in the courtyard and was not allowed to go home to take them off; the bandits shamelessly forced her to "strip naked." Chickens and pigs were all eaten. A two-year-old calf was slaughtered in Dingjiata'er Village, and a six-jin piglet in Julebao was also slaughtered. The bulletin issued by the headquarters of the 20th Security Regiment of the pseudo-Datong County Chief, stationed in Julebao specifically to seize grain, stated "Pacify the people" and "Collect grain," but in reality, they handed out three to five hemp sacks to each household, and beat those who filled them slowly, beat those whose grain was damaged, and beat those who didn't fill the sacks, causing head injuries and bloodshed. The enemy's atrocities raged for five days. Fearing our army's encirclement and annihilation, and under the attacks of our militia, they fled in panic on the 7th, leaving behind a debt of blood and tears for the people of eastern Datong.賀高成贺高成贺高成贺高成贺高成賀高成贺高成賀高成贺高成贺高成賀高成贺高成賀高成贺高成賀高成贺高成賀高成贺高成賀高成贺高成賀高成贺高成賀高成贺高成賀高成贺高成賀高成贺高成賀高成贺高成賀高成贺高成贺高成賀高成贺高成贺高成He Gaochang said it well: "As long as I am here, the house is a small matter; people can rebuild it. When we attack Datong in the future, I will do my best to help and vent my anger after capturing Yu Zhenhe (commander of the Datong bandit army) alive."

　　大同敌抢粮
  　遭受我打击
    【北岳电】大同匪三十八师一、二团及保安二、二十团，结合伪城东、阳高区乡级流亡土匪们约计三千余兵力，于十一月分由大同沿平绥路向东偷袭抢粮。
    城东人民当发觉阎匪出动抢粮的企图，在区村干部的领导下沿大道五十里铺、遇驾山、上庄、东西羊坊等村的妇女儿童老残，及牲畜及能带走的东西都转移到山地，民兵青壮年在村里坚持工作，埋设地雷，准备给抢粮匪徒以打击。敌人到村找不到人，吃不上饭，喝不上水，抢不走东西，遇到的是地雷和冷枪。敌人到上庄不到两小时踏响四个地雷，炸伤两名。敌人刚出村，民兵用冷枪打死特务一名。聚乐堡以同样办法击毙特务，匪徒们走路踏荒，进院跳墙，三两个不敢行动，曾想到山坡捉老百姓，也被民兵利用有利地形给以打击。距聚乐堡五里地的英咀墩击退过三次数倍于我的敌人进攻，打伤敌人一名，敌人终于未敢深入山地一步。仅在五十里铺、上庄，焚烧房子十余间，柴草无数。五里台的女人没走及，大部的棉裤子被匪徒们脱去。吴家洼××女人在堂地被捉住，允许回家给脱就不行，匪徒们无耻地立逼着“脱裸”。鸡猪被吃一空，丁家塔儿村一个二岁牛犊被宰杀，聚乐堡的六斤重的小猪也被宰杀。住在聚乐堡专门出来抢粮的伪大同县长保安二十团团部布告是、“安民”“征粮”，实际挨户给散麻袋三条、五条不等，装的慢了打，粮坏了打，装不满口袋的打，打的头破血流。敌人暴行猖獗了五天，因怕我军聚歼，在我民兵的打击下，于七号狼狈逃跑了，遗留给城东人民的是悲愤血债。贺高成说的好：“只要我在，房子事小，人在还能盖，将来打大同时，我要好好助把劲，活捉住于振河（大同匪军总司令）后再出气。”
