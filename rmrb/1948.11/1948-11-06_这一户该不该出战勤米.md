　　Should This Household Provide War Effort Rice?
    Question: Old man Shen Biancheng is sixty-two years old. His third nephew joined the army in February of the year before last and has since sacrificed his life. His second nephew went to move his younger brother's remains in April of last year and has not returned to this day. Last year, he provided a total of three *shi* of rice for service. His eldest nephew, Shen Laiyou, was conscripted for three months last year and should have received 450 *jin* of rice, but only received one *shi*. He repeatedly asked the anti-conscription director for the remaining rice, but was repeatedly denied. This family is still classified as a "wrongly labeled" middle peasant. Now I ask, should this person provide service rice? ·Yang Junqing·
    Answer: Serving in the war effort is the people's obligation. Everyone who should serve but has not due to some reason should provide service rice. If Shen Liancheng's second nephew indeed went to move the remains of his younger brother who sacrificed in the army and has not returned, and there is no news of him, and his whereabouts are unknown after such a long time, there may be some accident. The village should investigate his whereabouts and then handle the matter according to his actual situation. Before his situation is clarified, his war effort burden can be temporarily waived to take care of the difficulties of military families. However, if he is engaged in industry or commerce outside, or is evading and not returning, then he should provide war effort rice (service rice). Shen Laiyou's war effort burden should be calculated the same way as other villagers, and there should be no special treatment. However, the village should see if there is any unfairness to the "wrongly labeled" households, and if there are any deviations, they should be corrected. The burden should be fairly and reasonably distributed among all villagers.

　　这一户该不该出战勤米
    问：申边成老汉六十二岁，三侄子前年二月参军去了，已牺牲。二侄子去年四月去搬弟尸骨，至今未回来。去年一年共出差米三石。大侄子申来有，去年支差三个月，该得米四百五十斤只得了一石，下欠米再三和抗勤主任要，屡次不给，此家还是一个错斗中农成份。现问该人是否应出差米。　　　　·杨俊卿·
    答：服战勤是人民的义务，每个该出差而因故未出差就应出差米。而申连成的二侄子如确系去搬他在部队上牺牲的弟弟的尸骨未回，又无音信，还不明下落，时间这么长，恐怕是有什么事故，村里应该查明他的下落，然后按他的实际情况处理。他的战勤负担问题，在未查明前，可暂免他本人的战勤负担，以照顾军烈属困难。但如果他系在外经营工商业或逃避不回，则应出战勤米（差米）。而申来有本人的战勤负担应和村里群众同样出差算帐，不应特殊。但对错斗户，村上应看是否有不公道地方，如有偏差则应纠正。应该全村群众负担上一律公平合理。
