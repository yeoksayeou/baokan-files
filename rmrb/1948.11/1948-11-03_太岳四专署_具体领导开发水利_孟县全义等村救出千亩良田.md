    Taiyue Fourth Administrative Office
    Specifically Leads Water Conservancy Development
    Quanyi and Other Villages in Meng County Save Thousands of Acres of Fertile Land
    [Taiyue Telegraph] The Fourth Administrative Office of Taiyue led the masses in Quanyi, Dianshang, Lidianshang and other villages in Meng County to develop water conservancy, turning more than 1,000 acres of滩地(sandbanks) into fertile land. Quanyi and other three villages originally had more than 1,000 acres of滩地(sandbanks), with good soil quality and bountiful harvests every year. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), the great flood of the Yellow River raised the north bank, blocking the water from Han Tan and diverting it northward, and these more than 1,000 acres of滩地(sandbanks) were flooded. More than 300 acres of which were often one or two feet deep, making it impossible to cultivate at all, and the remaining 600 acres could still grow some sorghum. However, the harvest was very low, and if there was heavy rain and rising water in the autumn, it would all be flooded. Over the past ten years, everyone has tried their best, but due to the lack of specific leadership, they have not been able to complete the repair. On September 10, the Taiyue Fourth Administrative Office specially sent a water conservancy team to measure and work out a solution: to open a 95-meter canal from the southeast side of the water in Han Tan × 水 ×, and still introduce the water into the Yellow River, and then build a 24-zhang 3-chi high and 3-chi wide dike on the north side of Han Tan to block the northward flow of water. In this way, more than 1,000 acres of滩地(sandbanks), 600 acres can immediately become fertile land. The entire project requires approximately 1,204 workdays. However, because it was the busy autumn season, coupled with everyone's lack of confidence, it was postponed until after the autumn harvest. The water conservancy team first discussed with the cadres of the three villages and believed that if it was completed before the autumn, more than 600 acres of滩地(sandbanks) could be planted with wheat immediately. Furthermore, they would not be afraid of heavy autumn rains and rising water, which would damage the sorghum again. At the same time, the project was not large, and with more than 1,000 workdays divided among the labor force of the three villages, each laborer would only bear a little more than one workday. Subsequently, the cadres of each village went to various parts of the village to publicize. Because the project plan was specific and clear, it was quickly accepted by the masses, and they proposed solutions: such as working in sections and completing them as soon as possible, so as not to delay the autumn harvest or the planting of wheat. The cadres of each village also took the lead in competing to do dangerous work. For example, the village chief of Dianshang signed up to build the dike, and the cadres of Quanyi village held meetings of cadres from various 里(villages) overnight to organize forces, and everyone went to borrow furniture more than ten miles away overnight, and started work the next day. The entire section was 105 zhang long, and it was originally planned to use 260 workdays, but it was completed in only 151 workdays. The entire dike of Dianshang Village was originally planned to use 585 workdays, but only 193 and a half were used later. The water from Han Tan was introduced into the Yellow River, and more than 600 acres of滩地(sandbanks) could be planted with wheat immediately. The remaining 300 acres of old wasteland, the democratic government has lent money to organize the masses to reclaim.
    [Taihang News] Li Chongqing, the deputy of Shangmatian Village in the Fourth District of Zuoquan, after studying in the county, the confused thoughts and negative emotions in his mind turned into enthusiasm for serving the masses. On the way back, seeing the gurgling river water, he planned to improve the water into the fields, how great it would be for the interests of the masses to turn 300 acres of dry land into water land! How much grain could be increased! He walked and calculated, figuring that opening a canal and mobilizing the masses could be completed in three days. The next day, he discussed with the masses and cadres, and everyone was satisfied. Therefore, all the male laborers in the village, 261, the children, 22, and the women, 43, were mobilized. Starting from September 23, as soon as they heard the broadcast, they all carried @ heads to gather and start work. As a result, it was not used for three days, but only two days to complete it. The canal is more than four 里(villages) long, including more than one 里(villages) of stone canal, 2.5 chi deep and 2.9 chi wide, and can irrigate 362.3 mu of land, and the masses are very happy.

    太岳四专署
    具体领导开发水利
    孟县全义等村救出千亩良田
    【太岳电】四专署领导孟县全义、店上、历店等村群众开发水利，将一千多亩滩地变为良田。全义等三村原有滩地一千多亩，地质较好，年年丰收。民国二十二年黄河大水将北岸淤高，把韩滩所发的水堵向北流，这一千多亩滩地就被淹没，其中三百多亩经常有一二尺深的水，根本无法耕种，其余六百多亩尚可种些高粱。但收成很低，如秋季雨多水涨，还会全部淹没。十年来，大家曾想尽办法，但因缺乏具体领导，终没修成。九月十日，太岳四专署特派水利小组前往测量，并研究出办法：从韩滩×水×的东南面开九十五公尺的渠，仍将水引入黄河，又在韩滩北面再修二十四丈三尺高三尺宽的河堤，堵住向北流的水头，这样，一千多亩滩地，有六百亩立即可变成良田。全部工程约需工一千二百零四个。可是因为正是秋忙时期，加上大家信心不高，就要推到秋后作。水利小组先与三村干部研究后，认为如在秋前完成，就有六百多亩滩地马上可以种麦。更不怕秋季雨大水涨，再淹坏高粱，同时工程也不大，一千多个工按三村劳力平均，每个劳力才负担一个多工。随后，各村干部分头深入宣传。因为工程计划具体明确，很快被群众接受了，并且提出办法来：如分段做活，尽先完成，既不误秋收，也不误种麦。各村干部也带头争做险工，如店上村长报名作堤，全义村干部连夜召开各闾干部会议，组织力量，大家又连夜到十里以外借家具，第二天就开工。全段一百零五丈，原计划用工二百六十个，结果一百五十一个工就修成。店上村全堤原计划用工五百八十五个，后只用了一百九十三个半。韩滩的水引入黄河，一千多亩滩地有六百多亩当下就能种麦。其余三百多亩老荒滩，民主政府已贷款组织群众开垦。
    【太行讯】左权四区上麻田村副李崇卿在县里学习以后，脑子的糊涂思想与消极情绪变成了为群众服务的热忱。往回返时，看见河水潺潺，便盘算着把这水改进田里，能把三百亩旱地变为水地，对群众利益有多大！能增加多少粮食！他一边走路一边算帐，算计要开一道渠，动员群众，三天就能完成。第二日便和群众、干部商议，大家一致都满意。于是全村各队男劳力二六一名，儿童二二名，妇女四三名总动员，从九月二十三日开始，一听广播就都扛着＠头集合动工，结果没用三天，只两天就完成了。此渠共长四里多，内有一里多石渠，深二·五尺，宽二·九尺，能浇地三六二·三亩，群众都很高兴。
