Letter from Wang Yaowu, Chen Jincheng, Huo Shouyi, and 90 Others, Students of the Officer Training Corps of the East China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, to All Party and Government Organs and Troops of the Kuomintang

To all Kuomintang party, government, and military organs and all troops:

The evolution of human thought and society belongs to upward progress; it is the law of historical development and the political trend of the world. After the First World War, only the Soviet Union implemented socialism, but after the Second World War, fourteen countries, such as Romania, Czechoslovakia, Albania, Greece, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, established people's governments and implemented New Democracy. In other countries, such as France, Italy, Japan, and Korea, the people are also initiating a democratic upsurge and carrying out liberation struggles. This shows that the anti-people front is gradually collapsing, and imperialism is heading towards destruction. This is not a temporary phenomenon of abnormal development but an inevitable law of historical development. Looking at the political trend in our country, after the "April 12th" split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in 1927, Chiang Kai-shek betrayed Sun Yat-sen's three major policies, eliminated the Communist Party, and carried out massacres. Afterwards, although the Communist Party had heroic acts such as the Nanchang Uprising, the Autumn Harvest Uprising, and the Guangzhou Uprising, Chiang Kai-shek launched a million-strong army to carry out five encirclement and suppression campaigns, surrounding the Communist Party in a corner of Jiangxi. At that time, the Chinese people must have thought that the Chiang faction would surely win, and the Communist Party would surely perish. However, after twenty years of arduous and cruel struggle, the Communist Party has gradually grown stronger. This is the principle that those who win the people prosper, and those who lose the people perish.

After the victory against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek not only monopolized the fruits of victory but also used the pretext of peace talks to secretly mobilize large armies and launch a civil war, attacking everywhere. Chen Cheng initially boasted of annihilating all the Communist troops in three months and then automatically changed it to half a year. But what was the result of two years of fighting? On the contrary, more than two million Chiang troops were annihilated, and Chiang Kai-shek controlled only two or three isolated cities in North China, such as Beiping, Zhangjiakou, Tianjin, and Xi'an. Strategically, he also changed from a full-scale offensive to a focused offensive, then from a focused offensive to a full-scale defense, and then from a full-scale defense to a focused defense. Now, key points such as Jinan and Jinzhou cannot be defended and are still being liberated.

When Chiang Kai-shek issued the mobilization order and launched a total war, the quantity, quality, equipment, and supply of Chiang's army were many times superior to those of the People's Liberation Army. Why did the strong enemy defeat the weak? This is determined by the international political trend and the direction of the Chinese people's hearts, and it is also destined by the laws of historical development. However, the Chinese people, deceived by Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda, regard the Communist Party as a poisonous snake. In fact, the Communist Party's general policy is to oppose imperialism, oppose feudalism, and overthrow bureaucratic capitalism. What it implements is New Democracy, with the proletariat—the Communist Party—leading a national united front of all oppressed classes and democratic parties to struggle together. At the same time, the Communist Party has also formulated land policies of "land to the tillers," urban policies and policies to protect national industry and commerce for industrialization, and lenient policies for striving for and protecting the liberated civil and military officials and soldiers. In short, all its policies, except for the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen families and bureaucratic capital, landlords, compradors, and a very small number of groups, are welcomed by more than 90% of the broad masses of the people across the country.

Huo Shouyi and others have studied in the liberated areas for a long time and have seen and heard a lot. Therefore, we dare to faithfully report to correct misunderstandings. Since you are members of the Kuomintang, you should know that Sun Yat-sen advocated the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and support for workers and peasants. Now Chiang Kai-shek has usurped the party for selfishness and stolen the country for wealth. He has become a traitor to Sun Yat-sen and a sinner of the Kuomintang. If the Kuomintang's policies are not implemented by party members, but are implemented by the Communist Party, then as members of the Kuomintang, you should not only feel ashamed but also accept the leadership of the Communist Party, jointly eliminate the traitor Chiang Kai-shek clique, and jointly seek the happiness of the country. Therefore, those who work in Chiang Kai-shek's party and government organs are expected to accelerate their political awakening and join the national united front. Those who work in Chiang's army are expected to revolt on the battlefield or withdraw from the civil war. If you are forced by circumstances and cannot be independent, it is also hoped that you will lay down your weapons as soon as possible and not make a strong resistance, so that the nation can retain more vitality, the people can suffer less disaster, and the great cause of national construction can be completed earlier. Then it will be the fortune of the people and your fortune. Sincere words, I hope you will consider them carefully.

　　王耀武陈金城霍守义等九十人告国民党各党政机关各部队书
    华东军区解放军官教导团学员王耀武、霍守义、陈金城、聂松涛、罗辛理、丁基石、刘玉田、谭子琦、钱伯英、张尊光、邹炎、路可贞、李英才、熊仁荣、万壑涛、陶景奎、吕祥云、张忠中等九十人日前联名发表告国民党各党政机关各部队书如下：全国国民党各党政军机关、各部队均鉴：
    人类思想与社会进化，俱属向上之进步，为历史发展之规律，为国际之政治趋向。当第一次世界大战后，实行社会主义，不过苏联一国而已，但第二次世界大战后，如罗马尼亚、捷克斯拉夫、阿尔巴尼亚、希腊、保加利亚、南斯拉夫等十四国俱建立人民政府，而实行新民主主义，其他如法、意、日、韩诸国人民亦正掀起民主高潮，而进行解放斗争。足见反人民之阵线，日渐崩溃，帝国主义日趋灭亡，此非畸形发展之暂时现象，而为历史发展之必然规律。再如我国之政治趋向，当十六年“四一二”国共分裂，蒋介石竟背叛孙总理之三大政策，消除共党，大肆屠杀。此后共党虽有南昌起义、秋收起义、广州起义等壮举，然经蒋介石发动百万大兵，五次围剿，将共党围于江西一隅，彼时，国人必以蒋党必胜，共党必亡。然共党经二十年之艰苦惨酷斗争，终至日渐壮大，此盖得民者昌，失民者亡之理也。
    抗战胜利以后，蒋介石不但独吞胜利果实，且借口和谈，暗调大军，发动内战，到处进攻。陈诚初则鼓吹三月全歼共军，继则自动改为半年，然两年作战之结果如何？相反，为全歼蒋军两百余万，而蒋介石所控制华北，仅北平、张垣、天津、西安等二三座孤城而已。其战略方面，亦由全面进攻，改为重点进攻，再由重点进攻，改为全面防御，嗣又由全面防御，转为重点防御，现则如济南、锦州等重点，亦无法防御，而仍被解放。
    当蒋介石颁布动员令，发动总体战之时，蒋军之数量、质量、以及装备、补给种种条件，莫不优越于解放军多倍，以强敌弱，何反败亡？此乃国际政治之趋向与中国民心之背向所决定，亦为历史发展规律所注定。而国人受蒋介石之欺骗宣传，竟视共产党为毒蛇，其实中共之总政策，为反帝反封建与打倒官僚资本主义，其实行者为新民主主义，以无产阶级——共产党所领导的、各被压迫阶级、各民主党派之民族统一战线，共同奋斗。同时，中共更依据其总政策而订有耕者有其田之土地政策，因建设工业化，而订有城市政策与保护民族工商业政策，因争取与保护被解放之文武官吏、士兵，而订有宽大政策。总之，其各种政策，除蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族与官僚资本、地主、买办、极少数集团而外，俱为全国百分之九十以上广大人民所欢迎。
    守义等在解放区学习较久，见闻较广，用敢忠实报导，以正视听。君等既为国民党员，当知孙总理方主联俄、联共、拥护工农三大政策之本旨，今蒋介石篡党自私，窃国自富，已为孙总理之叛徒，国民党之罪人。国民党之政策，党员不予奉行，而共产党行之，身为国民党党员者，不但感愧于心，且应接受共产党之领导，而共歼总理之叛徒蒋介石集团，共谋国家之康乐。是以其工作于蒋介石之党政机关人员，望即加速政治觉悟，参加民族统一战线。其工作于蒋军者，即盼战场起义，或退出内战，如为环境所逼，无法自主者，亦望早日放下武器，不作坚强抵抗，使国族多留一分元气，人民减少一分灾难，建国大业，提早完成。则既人民之幸，亦君等之幸。掬忱之言，伏维亮察。
