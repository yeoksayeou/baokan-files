　　"Capture the Traitor Yan and Settle Accounts!"
　　Xin County Masses Eagerly Donate Equipment
　　Pingshou Laborers Heroically Rescue the Wounded
　　[Our Newspaper Dispatches] Under the unwavering belief of "March on Taiyuan, capture the traitor Yan and settle accounts!" the people of Xin County have launched a vigorous voluntary equipment donation campaign to support the front lines. In the Houhebao administrative village, Seventh District, the allocation of equipment was completed overnight in all natural villages. After mobilization and education by the branch and cadre meetings, the village held a mass meeting. Squad leader Zhou Jinshu took the lead in declaring a large pot, and Secretary Yan Mingcheng also declared a pot. Zhang Shengke declared wooden boards, and poor peasant Zhang Taoqi, fearing his donation would be rejected, rushed to declare. When there were no pockets available, the masses suggested buying cloth and sewing them overnight. In Yangpo Village, Seventh District, a mass meeting was held, where everyone discussed questions such as: For whom are we fighting in Taiyuan? Who are we relying on to fight? How should we fight? It was unanimously agreed that fighting in Taiyuan is for ourselves, the troops are fighting for the masses, and we cannot rely solely on the troops to fight in Taiyuan. We must rely on everyone. The troops fight in the front, and the common people support in the rear. Good support means a quick victory, and poor support means a slow victory. After this discussion, the masses' understanding and awareness were raised. Farmers Yang Mangui and Chen Chengsuo declared pockets, and the number of pockets alone exceeded the original assigned task. Other equipment was also declared voluntarily, and twice the task was completed within three days. The situation was the same in the new district. In Han'yan Village, Fourth District, before liberation, a total of 175 people were forced to commit suicide due to hunger or grain demands under the tyrannical rule of Yan's bandits. When the personnel of the democratic government first arrived in the village, many families had buckwheat husks poured out in front of their doors (a local custom, where the buckwheat husks from the pillow of the deceased are poured out in front of the door). After this period of relief and education, the masses' awareness was raised. In supporting the front, in addition to completing other equipment tasks, due to the lack of livestock and difficulties in transportation, children and women spontaneously organized a transportation team of 160 people, delivering 6,000 jin of firewood in two days. Many people in the village, upon hearing about the attack on Taiyuan, happily said: "Open Taiyuan sooner and catch the old dog (referring to the traitor Yan) to take revenge."
　　[Jinzhong Telegram] Filled with boundless hatred for Yan's bandits, the laborers of Pinging and Shouyang participated in this Taiyuan campaign. They rescued the wounded and transported equipment on the front lines, amidst the rain of bullets, displaying extraordinary heroism. Shouyang laborer Tian Sihai accepted a task from Yuci City while ill, and carried a lot of supplies. He refused when someone offered to take his place. Wang Zhenwen, a party member, became ill on the front lines, but he did not tell anyone and continued to complete his tasks as usual. Yin Jin, of the same company, had sores on his legs, but he tied them with ropes three or four times and continued to complete his tasks. On October 26th, the Third Company of laborers delivered shells to the front lines, completing two tasks in one go. The First Battalion, Second Company of Pinging laborers formed seven stretcher teams of twenty-eight people, carrying wounded soldiers back from the front lines and voluntarily carrying twenty-eight wooden beams. Squad leader Liu Erniu worked especially hard in transporting back and forth. On October 18th, when delivering door panels, others carried two pieces, but he carried four. After delivering twice, everyone was very tired, but a new task came. He encouraged everyone, saying: "We must endure hardship, we cannot let the front lines stop fighting. Fighting Yan Xishan is our own business, if we don't do it, who will?" The Ninth Company of laborers walked more than 100 li overnight to deliver equipment to the front lines. From October 13th to 15th, when our army attacked the Shizui stronghold, the Third Company of Shouyang laborers followed the army, delivering ammunition and carrying the wounded. They rested very little during the three days and nights, and their morale remained high. Their heroic activities on the front lines were never intimidated by enemy fire. Song Jiao'er and twenty-three others transported ammunition through a road section blockaded by enemy fire. Song Jiao'er emboldened everyone, and they rushed through in one go, delivering the ammunition to the front lines. Once, they saw our wounded soldier Wang Laifu in front of the enemy's bunker. His stretcher team spontaneously went up and pulled him down. The Tenth Company, × Platoon laborers of Shouyang rescued and cared for the wounded on the front lines as if they were their own brothers. Li Zengshou jumped out when he saw the wounded and said: "Who are the troops fighting for on the front lines? Shouldn't we do our part?" The entire platoon jumped up and carried all ten or so wounded soldiers down. Li Quan of the Eleventh Company of laborers of the county took off his cotton coat and put it on a wounded soldier who had fallen asleep while he was being transported in the rain, while he himself was soaked by the rain. Nie Haifu and four others went to carry the wounded and saw three people wounded. They carried one person with two people and carried another on their backs with two people, completing the rescue in one go. The eastern mountains, the most heavily fortified area of Taiyuan by Yan's bandits, are a rolling loess hilly area with sparse population, no housing, and extremely difficult access to drinking water. Snow fell there in mid-October, and the cold was unbearable with the blowing snow. However, the Pingshou laborers, burning with the fire of revenge, overcame all kinds of difficulties and tirelessly completed their arduous tasks.

　　“活捉阎贼算总帐！”
    忻县群众踊跃献器材
  　平寿民工英勇救伤员
    【本报讯】忻县全县人民在“打到太原去，活捉阎贼算总帐!”的必胜信念下，各村展开了如火如荼的自愿献器材支前运动。七区后河堡行政村所属各自然村，分配器材一夜完成，该村经过支部、干部会的动员教育到群众会上，中队长周金书带头自报大锅一口，书记阎命成也报一口锅，张生科自报木板，贫农张淘气怕不要自己的，抢着去自报。当时没口袋，群众提出买布连夜缝。七区阳坡村开群众会，大家讨论为谁打太原？靠谁打？怎样打等问题，一致认为：打太原是为自家，部队打是为了群众，打太原不能光靠部队，要靠大家，部队在前边打，老百姓在后边支援，支援的好就打得快，支援的差就打得慢。经过这一番讨论，群众的认识和觉悟都提高了，农民杨满贵、陈成锁自报了口袋，仅口袋一项就超过原分配任务，其他器材也是自报，三天内完成了两次的任务。在新区也是一样，四区韩岩村未解放前在阎匪暴政下，曾因饿肚或要粮被逼自杀的共达一百七十五人。民主政府人员初到该村时，很多人家门口倒有荞麦皮（这里习俗，人死后将生前枕头内荞麦皮倒在门前）。经过这一时期的救济与教育，群众觉悟提高了，在支前中除完成其他器材外，因牲口少运输困难，儿童妇女自动组织了一百六十人的运输队，两天内送柴草六千斤。村中很多人听说打太原都高兴的说：“早些打开太原抓住老狗日的（指阎逆）报仇。”
    【晋中电】怀着对阎匪无限的愤恨，平定寿阳民工参加了此次太原战役，他们在前线抢救伤员，运送器材，出入枪林弹雨之中，表现了特别的英勇。寿阳民工田四海带病从榆次城接受任务，并且扛的很多，有人换他也被拒绝。王振文是个党员，在前线得了病，但他不告诉人，仍照常完成任务。该连尹金腿上有疮，他用绳子绑了三四道，也一直完成了任务。民工第三连十月二十六日往前方送炮弹，两次的任务一次便完成。平定民工一营二连二十八个人组成七付担架，由前线抬伤员回来，并自动扛木梁二十八根。班长刘二牛往返运输，特别出力。十月十八日送门板时，别人扛两块，他扛四块，送了两次之后大家都很疲累，但又有了新任务，他便鼓励大家说：“只能咱们吃苦，不能叫前方住了手，打阎锡山是自己的事，咱不干叫谁干？”九连民工往前线送器材一夜走了一百多里。十月十三日至十五日，我军打石咀据点时，寿阳民工三连随军送弹药抬伤员，三昼夜中很少休息，始终情绪高涨。他们在前线英勇活动从不被敌人的炮火吓住，宋角儿等二十三人运送弹药要通过敌人火力封锁的路口，宋角儿给大家壮胆，一股劲地突过去把弹药送到了前线。一次他们看见敌人碉堡跟前有我们的伤员王来福，他的一组担架便自动上去拉了下来。寿阳十连×排民工，在前线如同爱护自己兄弟一样的抢救爱护伤员。李增寿见了伤员便跳出来说：“部队在火线上打仗为了谁？咱们还不出点力？”全排都跃上去把十来个伤号都抬了下来。该县民工十一连李全，在某次送伤员时路上下起雨来，伤员睡着了他便脱下棉衣给伤员盖上，自己淋着雨。聂海福等四人去抬送伤员，看见三个人挂了彩，他们便两人抬一个，另外两人各背一个，一次抢救下来。阎匪屏卫太原设防最为坚固的东山，是一个岗峦起伏的黄土丘陵地带，人烟稀少，没有住屋，吃水也极困难，十月中旬该地即降雪，雪风吹来严寒难忍，但被复仇怒火燃烧着的平寿民工，却战胜了种种困难，一时不懈的完成着艰苦的任务。
