    Rice Scramble in Shanghai and Nanjing Spreads
    Wave of Strikes and Sabotage Surge

    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th] Shanghai rice prices continue to soar, and rice scramble riots are increasing. According to Reuters reports on the 7th, 8th, and 9th, the price of rice rose from 280 yuan per shi (puppet gold yuan, same below) on the 6th to 500 yuan per shi on the 7th, then to 900 yuan per shi on the 8th, and soared to 1,800 yuan per shi on the 9th (equivalent to 5.4 billion old legal tender), and in reality, it was impossible to buy rice even with money. The price increase on the 9th was more than 77 times the "limited price" of 23 yuan per shi. This surge greatly exceeds the period before the "currency reform." For example, during the most intense July surge before the "currency reform," the price of rice only rose from 38 million old legal tender per shi to 65 million yuan per shi daily, while this time it has been continuously doubling at a geometric rate.

    In this surge, which Reuters calls "Shanghai's unprecedented economic crisis in a century," the starving Shanghai citizens can no longer survive. Rice scramble riots are increasing daily. According to a Reuters report on the 7th, there were as many as twelve rice scramble riots in Shanghai in one day. The Kuomintang reactionary government has dispatched more police to various streets, armored vehicles are speeding on the streets all day, and about 100 people have been arrested (Agence France-Presse, 9th). The soaring price of rice has led to a surge in the prices of various items from industrial raw materials to matches. Matches rose from 0.33 yuan per box to 5.5 yuan (8th), then to 10 yuan (9th), and "Good Luck" brand cigarettes rose to 18 yuan per pack. The soaring prices have brewed another buying spree. According to Agence France-Presse on the 9th, almost all stores in Shanghai were actually closed on the 9th. Some only opened for a few hours, and even wholesale transactions were completely paralyzed.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th] Comprehensive reports from various sources: Nanjing, which declared temporary martial law due to the deteriorating military situation in Xuzhou, saw a rice scramble storm sweep the city on November 10th, the first day of martial law. More than one hundred rice shops were robbed in one day (Agence France-Presse, 10th). On average, each rice shop had 500 people scrambling for rice, most of whom were rickshaw pullers, pedicab drivers, and workers. One starving civilian who was scrambling for rice said that he had not eaten for three days (Associated Press, 10th). The Kuomintang reactionary government carried out armed suppression of these starving civilians, arresting 200 people (Agence France-Presse, same day). They also opened fire several times when the starving civilians were scrambling for rice, resulting in three people being trampled to death and many people seriously injured (Reuters, 10th).

    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th] Comprehensive reports from various sources: The wave of strikes against hunger and for warmth, which broke through the Kuomintang government's reactionary decrees such as the "August 19th" ban on strikes and sabotage, is surging in major cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, shaking the Nanjing small court's precarious rule. According to the Associated Press on the 10th, 12,000 railway workers in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou went on strike. According to the Associated Press on the 10th, workers and staff of the Shanghai British-owned Water Works, British-owned Tram Company, French-owned Tram Company, employees of the British-owned Gas Company, and 2,000 employees of the Jianghai Customs have all gone on strike. Workers in many other factories and companies in the city have also risen up in strikes or are brewing strikes. What they are demanding is rice, which has risen in price over the past week from 80 yuan to 1,800 yuan per dan (a unit of dry measure) in puppet gold yuan. News from Shanghai and Nanjing continues to say that the ferry workers between Pukou and Nanjing, hundreds of employees of the Jinpu Railway in Pukou, all the workers of the British-owned Jardine Matheson in Xiaguan, Nanjing, all the workers of eight silk factories in the third district of Hangzhou, over a thousand workers in various textile factories in Ningbo, and the letterpress workers of various newspapers in Nanchang have all gone on strike since mid-last month.

    [Xinhua News Agency, North China, 12th] While the anti-hunger movement in the education circles of Ping, Tianjin, and Tangshan is surging, the anti-hunger strikes in Nanjing, Qingdao, and Chengdu are also rising vigorously. According to the newspapers of Ping and Tianjin, professors from various universities and colleges in Nanjing went to the Kuomintang government's Executive Yuan on the morning of October 29th to "request leave," demanding improved treatment for faculty and staff and public funding for all students. Professors at Shandong University in Qingdao went on strike for three days starting on November 1st, demanding the allocation of coal and grain, adjustments in salaries, and the distribution of daily necessities. Faculty and staff of various provincial schools in Chengdu went on a general strike on October 25th because they were unable to live due to high prices and had repeatedly petitioned the Kuomintang Sichuan Provincial Government without results.

　　蒋介石的经济基础正在崩溃
    沪宁抢米风潮扩大
  　罢工怠工怒潮汹涌
    【新华社陕北十三日电】上海米价继续狂涨，抢米骚动日益扩大。据路透社七、八、九三日报导：米价由六日之每石二百八十元（伪金圆券，下同）涨至七日每石五百元，八日再涨至每石九百元，九日竟涨至每石一千八百元（合旧法币五十四亿元），且实际上有钱也买不到米。九日价格如与“限价”每石廿三元相比，已上涨七十七倍多。这种猛涨的情形大大超过“币改”以前时期。例如“币改”前最猛烈的一次七月涨风，米价仅由每石旧法币三千八百万元逐日上涨至六千五百万元，而这次却是按几何级数连续倍涨。
    在这路透社称之为“上海百年来空前经济危机”的涨风中，饥饿的上海市民生活不下去了，抢米骚动已日见增多，据路透社七日报导，上海抢米骚动一天内发生十二次之多。国民党反动政府在各街道加派警察，装甲车整日在街上疾驶，并逮捕约一百人（法新社九日电）。米价的狂涨带领了由工业原料至火柴的各种物品的狂涨。火柴由每盒三角三分涨至五元半（八日），再涨至十元（九日），“好运道”牌香烟每包涨至十八元。物价的狂涨，酿成了再一次的抢购风潮，据法新社九日电，九日上海几乎全部商店实际上都关了门，有些仅开门几小时，甚至批发交易也完全陷于停顿。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】综合各方消息：因徐州军事形势恶化而宣布临时戒严的南京，就在戒严的第一天，十一月十日，抢米风暴席卷全城，一天内被抢米店在百家以上（法新社十日电）。平均每家米店前抢米的达五百人，其中大多数是人力车夫、三轮车夫及工人。一个抢米的饥民说，他已经三天没有吃到饭了（合众社十日电）。国民党反动政府对于这些饥民实行武装镇压，遭逮捕的达二百人（法新社同日电）。并在饥民抢米时数度开枪，因而踏死三人，许多人受重伤（路透社十日电）。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】综合各方消息：冲破了国民党政府“八一九”禁止罢工、怠工等反动法令而崛起的反饥饿、争温饱的罢工怒潮，正激荡于国民党统治区各大城市，震撼着南京小朝廷摇摇欲坠的统治。据合众社十日电称：上海、南京与杭州的一万二千铁路工人一致罢工。美联社十日电称：上海英商自来水厂、英商电车公司、法商电车公司的工人及职员、英商煤气公司职工、江海关的二千员工均纷纷罢工。全市其他许多工厂和公司的工人也群起罢工或酝酿罢工。他们所要求的是一周来每担从伪金圆券八十元涨到一千八百元的大米。沪宁消息继称：浦口、南京间的摆渡工人、浦口津浦铁路员工数百人、南京下关英商和记洋行的全体工人、杭州第三区八家绸厂的全部工人、宁波各纺织厂千余工人及南昌各报的铅印工人，均于上月中旬以来先后罢工。
    【新华社华北十二日电】与平、津、唐山教育界反饥饿运动高涨的同时，南京、青岛、成都三地的反饥饿罢教亦风起云涌。据平、津报纸披露：南京各大学及专科学校教授，十月二十九日晨赴国民党政府行政院“请假”，要求改善教职员待遇及全部学生享有公费。青岛山东大学教授于十一月一日起罢教三天，要求拨发煤、粮，调整薪水及配售日用品。成都各省立学校教职员于十月二十五日总罢教，原因为物价高涨实在无法生活，屡次向国民党四川省政府请愿无结果。
