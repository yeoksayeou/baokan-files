　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Electric News Agency and TASS report: Italian workers are facing a difficult winter. The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party held a plenary session on the 13th and 14th to study the severe economic situation. There are already 2.5 million unemployed people in Italy. Hundreds of thousands of Italian families are under the threat of unsanitary conditions, misery, and starvation. The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party has drafted six recommendations to be submitted to the parliament. The six recommendations demand that factory owners be forced to stop laying off workers in the winter; stop laying off agricultural workers; extend relief to all unemployed people, double the amount of relief during the two months of winter, and begin implementing beneficial public works projects; freeze rents and the prices of major consumer goods, etc. The Italian Communist Party's proposal calls for taxing excessive profits over the past few years and imposing heavy fines on numerous tax evaders to fund the above-mentioned emergency plan.
　　The illegal wave of layoffs launched by Italian factory owners and the government under the direct orders of the US "Marshall Plan" executive bureau is arousing particularly great resentment among the working class, and the workers' struggle is intensifying sharply. On the 15th, all mines held a 24-hour protest strike in solidarity with the lignite workers of Sardinia, where employers threatened to close factories and dismiss thousands of workers. The workers have adopted a new tactic of "non-cooperation" (unwilling to perform any work not stipulated by the factory's work rules), a method of struggle that has proven very effective, and the Italian government discussed this issue at a special ministerial meeting held on the 9th. The workers' "non-cooperation" has made the situation in some industrial centers particularly tense. The struggle of agricultural workers against landlords' attempts to lay them off is equally intense. Agricultural workers in the provinces of Florence, Pisa, Naples, Livorno, Ragusa, etc., are all on strike.

　　研究严重经济情势下工人的困苦
  　意共中央举行全会
    全意矿工罢工抗议解雇工人
    【新华社陕北二十日电】电通社与塔斯社报导：意大利工人正面临着难过的寒冬。意共中央于十三、十四两日举行全会，研究严重的经济形势。意大利已有失业者二百五十万人。数十万的意大利家庭，正处在不卫生、悲惨、饥饿的威胁之下。意共中央已草成六项建议，准备向国会提出。该六项建议要求强迫厂主停止在冬季解雇工人；停止解雇农业工人；救济扩至全体失业者，在冬季两月中，救济量加倍，开始实行建设有益之公共工程；冻结租金及主要消费品的价格等。意共建议中要求对数年来的过分利得征税，并对繁多的逃税者处以高额罚款，以解决上述紧急计划的经费。
    意大利工厂主和政府在美国“马歇尔计划”执行局直接命令之下发动的非法的解雇浪潮，正在工人阶级中激起了特别巨大的愤恨，工人的斗争正剧烈的增加。十五日，所有的矿场均举行抗议罢工二十四小时，以声援撒丁岛的褐煤工人，该处雇主威胁要关厂并开除数千工人。工人们进行了“不合作”的新战术（不愿作工厂工作规则未予规定的任何工作），这一斗争方法已证明非常有效，意政府九日举行的特别部长会议上曾讨论了这一问题。工人的“不合作”已使某些工业中心的情势变得特别紧张。农业工人对地主解雇企图的斗争也同样紧张。佛罗伦萨、比萨、那不勒斯、里窝那、拉固萨等省的农业工人均在罢工中。
