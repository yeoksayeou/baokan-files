[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram] In the border areas of the Fourth District of Hebei-Shandong-Henan and the newly recovered areas of Henan, joint defense forces have been widely organized to suppress scattered bandits and stabilize social order. Since the recovery of Kaifeng and Heze, large groups of Kuomintang troops have either been annihilated or defeated. Small groups of enemies and some armed bandits and secret agents who escaped the net have been lurking in the local areas, disrupting social order, stealing livestock, kidnapping for ransom, and extorting money, causing great suffering to the masses. In addition to publicizing the policy of leniency to urge them to surrender themselves, our local democratic governments have been actively capturing and eliminating those who refuse to repent for their evil deeds, and, based on the demands of the masses, have assisted in organizing joint defenses to carry out mass-based suppression. After the enemy retreated from Kaifeng, there were more than 30 small groups of enemies remaining in Quhe, Changyuan, and Fengqiu areas. After more than 100 villages in the area established joint defenses, they were no longer disturbed by scattered bandits. Since the organization of joint defense in the Second District of Quhe, 35 bandits and secret agents have been captured, and various weapons have been seized. After the Second District of Dongming cleared out two groups of bandits in Dongmingji and Longshanji, there have been no more incidents of extortion or arrests in the district. According to reports, in the week from the 23rd to the 29th of last month, the armed forces of our Fifth District, in coordination with a certain unit of the military region, advanced to suppress the enemy in Kaocheng County and eliminated 160 enemies. By the afternoon of the 29th, all 700 remaining enemy troops surrendered. Under the power of our suppression, Sun Enfu, the instructor of the Third District of the puppet Caoxian County, along with 18 squad leaders and below, Jiang Hongding, the captain of the Second District of the puppet Minquan County, along with 39 men, and 18 officials from the puppet Kaocheng County government, all surrendered to us with their weapons. In addition, scattered bandits around Kaocheng, from the 28th of last month to the 4th of this month, in groups or individually, totaling over 100 people including captains and below, surrendered to us. After the enemy fled from Heze, a few members of the puppet organization hid in the countryside, robbing openly and stealing secretly. The government organized the masses in Baoningji and Youji areas to have two people from each village take turns patrolling at night and standing guard during the day. The armed forces department of Dingtao County led the militia in the Fourth District of Nan to suppress scattered bandits, capturing Qin Huaixun, the puppet Bao chief of Sanlijing in Nanding District, and two others. They seized three rifles and one pistol, and also recovered some of the property looted from the masses, which was distributed to the masses for identification and retrieval. The masses reflected, "Once this scourge is eliminated, we can live in peace." Taking this opportunity, the leaders convened a village cadre meeting for the entire district, explaining that defending the homeland cannot rely solely on the higher authorities, but must involve the masses organizing themselves for joint defense. All villages agreed with this idea, and thus more than 30 villages in the district were divided into three joint defense zones. All 36 natural villages in Huangdian District have also organized joint defenses.

　　冀鲁豫新收复区普建联防
  　剿灭散匪安定秩序
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫四分区边沿区及河南新收复区，广泛组织联防武装，清剿散匪，安定社会秩序。自我收复开封、菏泽之后，大股国民党军或被消灭、或被击溃；小股敌人及部分漏网之武装匪特等，即潜伏地方，扰乱社会秩序，牵牛架票，敲诈勒索，群众不堪其苦。我当地民主政府除宣传宽大政策，促其自动投案外，各县区武装特对作恶不悔之徒积极捕灭，并根据群众要求，协助组织联防，进行群众性的清剿。开封敌人退走后，残存在曲河、长垣、封邱一带的小股敌人，即达三十余股。该地百余村庄成立联防后，即不再受散匪扰害。曲河二区自组织联防后，即剿出土匪及特务三十五人，并剿出武器多种。东明二区在东明集、龙山集两处清出两股匪徒后，该区便再也没发生过勒款抓人事件。按上月二十三日至二十九日一周中，我五分区武装配合军区武装某部，进剿考城县敌，消灭敌一百六十名。至二十九日下午，守敌七百余人全部缴械投降。在我清剿威力下，伪曹县三区中队长指导员孙恩甫率领分队长以下十八名，伪民权二区中队长江洪鼎率领三十九名，及伪考城县政府官员等十八名，均携械向我投诚。此外，考城周围之散匪，自上月二十八号至本月四号，成股的及个别的有队长以下百余名向我投诚。菏泽敌逃走后，少数伪组织人员隐藏在乡间，明抢暗夺，政府又组织保宁集和游集一带群众，每村每天出两个人，轮流于夜间打更，白天放哨。定陶县武装部领导南四区的民兵清剿散匪。捕获南丁区三里井伪保长秦怀训等三人。缴获步枪三支，短枪一支，并剿出抢掠群众的财物一部，当分别让群众认领去。群众反映：“除了这一害，我们便能安心过日子了。”趁此机会，领导上便召开了全区村干会，说明保家自卫不能光依靠上级，必须群众组织起来联防自卫。各村都赞成这个意见，于是全区三十多个村庄，划分了三个联防区。黄店区三十六个自然村，也都组织了联防。
