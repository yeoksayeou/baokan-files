　　Chiang and Fu Bandit Gang's Sneak Attack on Shijiazhuang Completely Crushed by Our Army and People
　　[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The North China Military Region Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army issued a communiqué today regarding the crushing of the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gang's plot to sneak attack Shijiazhuang, stating: Under the combined assault of the military and civilians in our North Yue and Central Hebei regions, the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gang's plan to sneak attack Shijiazhuang has been shattered. The invading bandit troops fled back to Baoding in a panic on the 2nd of this month. The bandits involved in this attack included the entire 5th and 121st Divisions of the 94th Army, one regiment of the 43rd Division, the entire New 4th Cavalry Division, and the entire Reorganized 12th Cavalry Brigade, all under the unified command of Zheng Tingfeng, commander of the 94th Army. They launched their attack from Zhuoxian on October 24th, capturing Dingxing and Xincheng that day; on the 25th, the enemy's advance troops occupied Beihedian; on the 26th, the enemy occupied Xushui and Tiancunpu to the north; on the 27th, all of these enemy forces advanced to Baoding, Xushui, and Gucheng. Beihedian was subsequently recovered by us; on the 28th, the aforementioned enemy forces, together with the 272nd Division of the 101st Army (formerly the Provisional 32nd Division of the New 2nd Army, renamed), launched a three-pronged attack southward from Baoding, constantly encountering resistance from our troops and militia along the way. On the same day, the enemy advanced to Fangshun Bridge; at noon on the 29th, the enemy infantry advanced to Wangdu, while a portion of their cavalry attempted to cross the Tang River northwest of Dingxian at Shuai Village at dusk, but were repelled by us; the Reorganized 12th Cavalry Brigade also fled from Wangdu to the Dong and West Siwang areas east of Dingxian on the same day. On the morning of the 30th, a portion of our army surrounded the Reorganized 12th Cavalry Brigade in Dong and West Siwang, and after about an hour of fighting, routed the enemy, who fled northeastward, and were repeatedly ambushed by our local armed forces and militia in the area north of Boye and Lixian and near Zhangdeng, fleeing in disarray to Baoding. On the same day, the 94th Army and other units advanced in three columns along both sides of the railway from Wangdu, launching several attacks on our positions along the Qiliantun, Xiaoqiliantun, and Qingshui River line north of Dingxian on the south bank of the Tang River in the afternoon, but were all repelled. On that day, more than 500 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and some were captured. The enemy left behind dozens of bodies and retreated in panic to the north bank of the Tang River. After the 94th Army and other units attacked southward, only the 273rd Division of the 101st Army (formerly the Provisional 33rd Division of the New 2nd Army, renamed) remained to defend Baoding. The line from Zhuoxian to Xushui was completely empty. In order to strengthen the defenses of the Ping-Bao line and reinforce the bandits attacking southward, the enemy moved the Dagou Village north of Hedian, because the Beihe Bridge had been destroyed by us in advance, and our local armed forces and militia had widely laid mines along the railway, and used firepower to prevent the enemy from advancing. That night, the enemy advanced to the Tiancunpu and Baitapu line north of Xushui. The next day, we continued to block them at the North Gate of Xushui, and also blew up the Caohe Bridge. It was not until the 31st that the main force of the 35th Army, transported by trucks, arrived in Baoding. Beihedian is only 46.3 kilometers from Baoding. Under the strong road-breaking and bridge-blowing efforts of our local army and the obstruction, the enemy's motor vehicle transport had completely lost its rapid movement function. Fu Zuoyi, suffering these setbacks, realized that continuing to penetrate deeper would only lead to annihilation, and was forced to abandon his plan to attack Shijiazhuang. He then ordered Zheng Tingfeng to lead his troops to withdraw entirely to Fangshun Bridge on the 31st and return to Baoding on the 2nd. The 35th Army also moved north from Baoding on the 2nd, and the main force of the 16th Army, after advancing to Dingxing on November 1st, also remained stagnant. Thus, the Chiang and Fu bandit gang's plot to sneak attack Shijiazhuang has been completely crushed by us. Currently, in addition to the 94th Army still huddled near Xushui and the main force of the 16th Army gathered in the Dingxing Dagou area, there are no enemy traces south of Baoding.

　　军区司令部发表公报
    蒋傅匪偷袭石庄阴谋已被我军民完全粉碎
    【本报特讯】人民解放军华北军区司令部本日对粉碎蒋傅匪军偷袭石家庄的经过发表公报称：在我北岳、冀中两区军民合力打击下，蒋介石、傅作义匪帮同谋偷袭石家庄的计划已被粉碎，进犯匪军于本月二日狼狈回窜保定。此次出犯之匪，计有九十四军所属之第五师及一二一师全部，四十三师一个团，及新骑四师，整骑十二旅全部，由九十四军军长郑挺锋统一指挥，于十月二十四日自涿县出犯，当日陷我定兴及新城；二十五日敌先头占北河店；二十六日敌占徐水及以北之田村铺；二十七日，该敌全部进至保定、徐水、固城北河店遂又为我收复；廿八日，以上各敌连同一○一军之二七二师（原新二军暂三十二师改称），自保定分三路南犯，沿途均遭我部队及民兵阻击，当日敌进至方顺桥；二十九日午，敌步兵进至望都，其骑兵一部，黄昏自定县西北之帅村偷渡唐河未果，为我击退；整骑十二旅亦于同日自望都窜至唐河南岸定县以东之东、西四旺地区。三十日晨，我军一部在东、西四旺将整骑十二旅包围，战斗约一小时许，将该敌击溃，向东北逃窜，沿途在博野蠡县以北地区及张登附近复遭我地方武装及民兵狙击，狼狈逃往保定。同日，九十四军等部自望都分三路沿铁路两则，齐头并进，午后几度向唐河南岸定县以北之奇连屯、小奇连、清水河一线我阵地进攻，均被击退，是日毙伤敌五百余，俘获一部，敌遗尸数十具狼狈退回唐河北岸。九十四军等部南犯后，保定仅余一○一军二七三师（原新二军暂卅三师改称）守备，涿县至徐水一线完全空虚，敌为加强平保线防务，并增援南犯之匪，复将河店以北之大沟村，因北河桥已为我事先破坏，我铁路两侧地方武装及民兵复于沿途广布地雷，并以火力阻敌前进。当晚该敌进至徐水北之田村铺、白塔铺一线，次日我在徐水北关继续阻击，并将漕河桥炸毁，迄三十一日，以汽车载运之三十五军主力，始抵保定。北河店距保定仅四十六点三公里，在我地方军有力的破路炸桥及阻击下，使敌汽车运输已完全失其快速运动的作用，傅作义在遭受这些打击下，已觉醒到继续深入只有遭受歼灭的命运，不得不被迫放弃其进袭石家庄的计划。乃命郑挺锋率部于三十一日全部北撤至方顺桥，二日撤回保定。三十五军亦于二日由保定北开，十六军主力于十一月一日进至定兴后，亦滞留不前。至此蒋傅匪偷袭我石家庄之阴谋，已为我完全粉碎，现除九十四军仍猬集徐水附近，十六军主力集于定兴大沟一带外，保定以南已无敌踪。
