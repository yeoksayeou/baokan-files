On the 7th, in the Zhanggongdian area east of Shangqiu, Henan, the entire 181st Division of the enemy's 55th Army, which was fleeing east from Shangqiu, was annihilated. Except for those killed or wounded, all of the enemy were captured alive, including Mi Wenhe, the Deputy Commander of the Army and Commander of the 181st Division. The 55th Army was formerly part of the Northwest Army, under the command of Liu Ruming of the Fourth Pacification Zone of the Kuomintang. The current commander of the army is Cao Fulin. The 181st Division fled to Shangqiu from Heze, southwestern Shandong, at the end of September. On the 6th of this month, it fled east from Shangqiu and was completely annihilated.
