Responding to Jin Luwei, a teacher at Xinji Elementary School in Wuxun County, Regarding the Revision of Class Status:

    According to your letter, your family had no exploitative relationships before the establishment of the democratic government, so your class status should be middle peasant. After the establishment of the democratic government, hiring people because of participation in revolutionary work should not be considered exploitation, and designating you as a rich peasant is incorrect. You can apply to the work team to revise your class status. Class designation should adopt a democratic approach of self-declaration, public discussion, and approval by the masses; anyone with different opinions is allowed to express them. If, as you say, the work team and village cadres in your village did not hold mass meetings, did not allow you to reason, and forcibly designated you as a rich peasant, and sealed your door (even for rich peasants, only their surplus land and property can be confiscated, and they cannot be treated the same as landlords with universal confiscation), this is incorrect. Class designation can only be based on the 1933 document and Comrade Ren Bishi's report "Several Questions in Land Reform" and other documents as standards, and the correct standards for class designation cannot be modified arbitrarily. The work of concluding land reform must be very cautious and meticulous, and there should be no more violations of policy. Please have the Guantao County Party Committee inspect and correct the above situation if it is indeed true.

　　改订成份须采用自报公议的民主方针答武训县辛集高小教员靳鲁卫：
    照你来信所说，你家在民主政府成立前没有剥削关系，应是中农成份。民主政府成立后，因系参加革命工作而雇人，不能认为剥削，订为富农是不对的，你可向工作组申请改订成份。划成份应采取自报公议群众讨论通过的民主方式；任何人有不同的意见，都允许发表。若确如你说，你村工作组和村干在划成份中，不开群众会，不让你讲理，硬定你为富农成份，并封了门（对富农也只能是征收其多余土地财产，不能和对待地主一样一律没收）是不对的。划阶级只能根据一九三三年文件和任弼时同志的报告“土地改革中的几个问题”等文件为标准，不能随便修改划成份的正确标准。结束土改的工作，必须十分慎重细致，不容仍有违反政策现象。以上情况是否确实，请馆陶县委予以检查纠正。
