Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 27th – The Northeast People's Liberation Army Field Army Headquarters announced today the battle progress of the autumn offensive to liberate all of Northeast China, stating:

　　The great autumn offensive by the Northeast People's Liberation Army to completely annihilate the Kuomintang bandit army in Northeast China and liberate the entire Northeast region, which began on September 12th, concluded with complete victory on November 2nd. This campaign lasted fifty-two days, with the front stretching from Changchun in the north to the Changli and Luanxian sections of the Beining Railway in the south, extending over 1,500 li. It resulted in the total annihilation of over 400,000 enemy troops, including the enemy’s Northeast “剿匪” (Bandit Suppression) Headquarters, the "剿总" Jinzhou Command Post, the Ji-Re-Liao Border Region Headquarters, four army group headquarters, eleven corps headquarters, thirty-three complete divisions (brigades), four garrison headquarters (each with three regiments), and all directly subordinate units, special forces, and local troops. This was an offensive of unprecedented scale for our army. The course of events is summarized as follows:

　　(1) After undergoing a major military and political consolidation during the summer, our army's strength was unprecedentedly replenished, and its combat effectiveness was unprecedentedly enhanced. On September 12th, our army launched the autumn offensive from the vicinity of Changchun, Siping, Kaiyuan, and other places, and after a long march, deployed on the Beining Railway line. A portion of our army first suddenly raided the Jin(zhou)-Yu(guan) section, cutting off and separately surrounding the enemy in Xingcheng, Shahousuo, Suizhong, and other places, while another portion raided the Chang(li)-Luan(xian) section to delay the Eastern advance of the North China enemy troops. At the same time, our army again used a portion of its forces from the Goubangzi-Taian line to advance to the area between Jinzhou and Yixian, cutting off the enemy's retreat from Yixian and surrounding them. On September 28th and 29th, our army successively captured Suizhong and Xingcheng, annihilating over 6,000 enemy troops, cutting off the enemy's connection between Jinxi and Xingcheng, thereby containing the enemy's 54th Army in Jinxi and Huludao, and attracting the enemy's Provisional 62nd Division from Jinzhou to reinforce Jinxi. Another portion of our army annihilated more than two regiments of enemy troops that had moved north from Jinzhou, occupied the main outer positions northeast and north of Jinzhou city, and blockaded the Jinzhou West Suburb Airport with artillery fire. At the same time, another unit of our army inserted from the south of Jinzhou to the Gaoqiao-Tashan line, captured Tashan and Xihai Kou, and cut off the connection between Jinzhou and Jinxi. On October 1st, our army captured Yixian, annihilating a complete enemy division. As a result, Jinzhou, the main supply base of the enemy in Northeast China, was heavily surrounded by our army.

　　When the enemy felt the urgency of the situation in Jinzhou, they immediately airlifted their 49th Army for reinforcement, but only two regiments of the 79th Division were transported before the airport could no longer be used. Bandit Chiang Kai-shek deeply felt that the Jinzhou battle situation was related to the fate of the entire bandit army in Northeast China, and hurriedly flew to Ping and Shen to personally command. Chiang Kai-shek planned to rescue Jinzhou from two directions. One direction was to transfer all of its 62nd Army from North China, the Independent 95th Division directly under the North China "剿总," and the 21st Division of the 92nd Army, as well as two divisions of the 39th Army from Yantai, Jiaodong, to land in Huludao by sea successively, plus the four divisions of its original 54th Army stationed in Jinxi and Huludao, attached to the Provisional 62nd Division, totaling eleven divisions, attempting to advance north from Jinxi to relieve Jinzhou. The other direction was to organize the so-called "Liao Yaoxiang Westward Advance Corps" with the main force's main force, the New 1st Army, two divisions and one regiment each of the New 6th Army, the entire New 3rd Army, two divisions of the 71st Army, the 105th Division and one regiment of the 49th Army, the 195th Division of the original 52nd Army, and three cavalry brigades, dispatching them from Shenyang in full force, occupying our Zhangwu, attempting to cut off our rear supply line, threaten our attacking Jinzhou troops, and coordinate with the enemy in the isolated city of Changchun to break out to the south. Our army then used powerful blocking corps, adopting positional defense and mobile defense, to resist the enemy's reinforcements from both the north and south, and annihilated more than 12,000 of them. In particular, our Jinan blocking troops, relying on the Bohai Sea to the left and the Hongluoxian Mountains as a support to the right, conducted heroic resistance against the enemy on the Tashan-Hongluoxian line for seven days and nights, resisting six enemy divisions coming with naval and air support. The position stood firm and immovable, making it impossible for the enemy to advance an inch, and consistently rejecting the enemy in the Tashan area only thirty to forty li away from Jinzhou, ensuring that our Jinzhou attack deployment was completed and preparations were fully completed, which played a decisive role in our occupation of Jinzhou. From October 9th to 13th, our Jinzhou attacking troops, with five days and nights of heroic fighting, swept away all the outer strongholds of Jinzhou, constructed a spider web-like network of traffic trenches to approach the enemy, and directly pressed towards Jinzhou city. Finally, at 11:00 on the 14th, our army launched a general attack on the 100,000 enemy troops defending Jinzhou, quickly completed the breakthrough, and with bold and courageous infiltration tactics, inserted into the enemy's depth, completely breaking up the enemy's deployment, dividing the enemy, and encircling and annihilating the enemy's fortified strongholds one by one. After thirty-one hours of fierce fighting, all the defending enemies were annihilated, and none of the 100,000 enemy troops under Fan Hanjie and Lu Junquan escaped. From then on, the remaining enemies in Northeast China were all shaken.

　　(2) After the great victory at Jinzhou, a great shock was caused in the Chiang bandit camp, which led to the uprising of the 60th Army of the Changchun garrison and the complete surrender of the New 7th Army. The 90,000 enemy troops of the isolated city of Changchun, which had been besieged by us for a long time, were in an exceptionally demoralized state, having been annihilated by us in various battles since June, more than 4,000 in total. At the same time, due to our army's powerful political offensive, we also won over more than 18,000 officers and soldiers to escape the sea of ​​suffering and surrender to us. When our autumn offensive was launched, our siege troops still deployed rigorously, with hundreds of miles of continuous camps, heavily surrounding the enemy. When our army attacked Jinzhou, the enemy made exploratory attempts to break through, but were all repelled by our army and could not cross Lei Chi for a single step. Finally, Bandit Chiang Kai-shek strictly ordered the enemy to break out and flee south. At this time, the Yunnan troops of the 60th Army, under the leadership of Army Commander Zeng Zesheng, resolutely revolted under the prestige of our Jinzhou victory. As a result, the New 7th Army and its miscellaneous troops of more than 40,000 men were even more chaotic, and their lower-level officers and soldiers scrambled to surrender to us, finally forcing Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Commander of the Northeast "剿总" and Commander of the First Army Group, and Li Hong, Commander of the New 7th Army, and others to lay down their arms completely on the 19th. Changchun was thus liberated.

　　(3) At this time, the enemy Liao Yaoxiang Corps, lingering between Zhangwu and Xinlitun, had neither relieved the siege of Jinzhou nor achieved the purpose of coordinating with the Changchun defenders to escape south. Some senior bandit leaders in Northeast China once planned to order the corps to retreat to Xinmin and Shenyang, or turn to Yingkou to escape, but Bandit Chiang Kai-shek falsely claimed that our army could not quickly continue fighting after the great Jinzhou siege battle, and erroneously estimated that our army would take advantage of the victory and go south. Therefore, when he flew to Shenyang again, he blindly commanded the Liao Corps to continue advancing westward along the Beining Railway, and ordered Du Yuming to set up a command post in Huludao, attempting to sandwich and retake Jinzhou from the north and south. The entire enemy Liao Corps and the 3rd Brigade (equivalent to a division) of the 207th Division, which was redeployed from Xinmin, and attached with heavy artillery and armored vehicle units, concentrated all their forces on the 24th and 25th with air support, fiercely attacking our positions north of Heishan and Dahushan, but were met with strong resistance from our army, and did not gain an inch in two days. At that time, our Jinzhou victorious division secretly and swiftly moved east and arrived at its assembly position. After dusk on the 25th, the enemy again attempted to take the route of Taian and Panshan to escape to Yingkou, but failed due to our army's interception. When Bandit Chiang Kai-shek saw that things were not good, he hastily flew to Shenyang to personally command, ordering the Liao Corps to break out to the east. Unexpectedly, our northern main force, like a flying general from the sky, cut off the enemy's rear route one after another on the 25th and 26th. As a result, the enemy troops fell into a desperate situation with no way out. Our army then began a large-scale encirclement and annihilation battle in the Raoyang River and Liu River area, which was covered with water, on the morning of the 26th. The commanders and fighters of each unit gave full play to their divine courage, disregarding fatigue, quickly divided the enemy, heavily encircled and annihilated them, and completely annihilated the entire American-equipped Liao Yaoxiang Corps in two days and nights of fighting using the three fierce tactics of fierce attack, fierce charge, and fierce pursuit. The bandit leader Liao Yaoxiang and more than 80,000 people were captured alive.

　　(4) After the Liao Corps was completely annihilated, the enemy's lair in Shenyang was even more exposed. A small number of senior officials of the bandit Northeast "剿总," starting with Wei Lihuang, successively fled by plane. Our army then advanced rapidly towards Shenyang and Yingkou with relentless pursuit. When the Liao Corps attempted to advance westward along the Beining Railway, the enemy in Shenyang had already occupied our Yingkou with its 52nd Army on the 24th, attempting to obtain a route for escape by sea. The 1st Brigade and 2nd Brigade of its 207th Division had also fled to Liaoyang and Anshan at this time. In order to cover its Shenyang airlift, the enemy redeployed them back to Shenyang and ordered them to defend Shenyang, together with three divisions of the 53rd Army, the Provisional 53rd Division which had escaped from Taian, and the various special forces directly under the "剿总" and three cavalry brigades, four garrison headquarters, and other units, all under the command of Zhou Fucheng, commander of the enemy's 8th Army Group. Our army, without stopping, continuously marched hundreds of miles from the Liaoxi Dahushan battlefield and south of Changchun, intercepting and fiercely attacking the fleeing enemy, and attacked Shenyang. On the 29th and 30th, Xinmin, Tieling, Fushun, Benxi, Liaoyang, Anshan, Haicheng and other cities were successively recovered, annihilating one division and one regiment of the fleeing 53rd Army and two garrison headquarters. The large army approached Shenyang and Yingkou directly. On the 29th, we occupied Shenyang Dongling Airport. At 4:00 on the 31st, our army began to break through in the Tiexi District, and the enemy's 8th Army Group headquarters and others surrendered one after another. Only the 207th Division of its Party-influenced troops was still struggling desperately, and it was completely resolved by us at 4:00 pm on November 2nd. The Shenyang battle lasted only two days, completely annihilating 100,000 defending enemies. At this point, Shenyang City, the largest industrial city in Northeast China, with a population of 1.8 million, which had been occupied by the enemy for two years, seven months, and twenty days, was completely liberated. Our attacking Yingkou troops also killed 3,000 enemies who were fleeing by boat with artillery fire, and at 11:00 on the 2nd, completely annihilated the enemy's 2nd Division of the 52nd Army, one regiment of the 25th Division, and the army's directly subordinate human transport regiment, liberating the important port of Yingkou. The enemies lingering in the narrow beachhead of Jinxi and Huludao and the isolated city of Chengde fled in panic successively on the evening of November 9th and noon on the 12th. At this point, the entire enemy army in Northeast China was destroyed, and the ten provinces of Northeast China (including Rehe Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region) were all liberated. Our great people's liberation war in the Northeast battlefield, which lasted for three years, achieved a complete and thorough victory.

　　东北我军秋季攻势规模巨大
  　战线绵延千五百里  全歼敌军四十余万
    【新华社沈阳二十七日电】东北人民解放军野战军司令部，本日公布此次秋季攻势解放全东北的战役经过称：
    东北人民解放军全歼东北国民党匪军、解放东北全境的伟大秋季攻势，自九月十二日开始，至十一月二日，已告全部胜利完成。此一战役，历时五十二日，战线北起长春，南至北宁线之昌黎、滦县段，绵延达一千五百余里。全歼敌军四十余万，包括敌东北“剿匪”总司令部、“剿总”锦州指挥所、冀热辽边区司令部、四个兵团司令部、十一个军部、三十三个整师（旅）、四个守备总队（每总队三个团）、与所有直属部队、特种部队及地方部队。此为我军空前巨大规模的一次攻势，其经过概述如下：
    （一）我军经过夏季军政大整训后，军力空前充实，战力空前提高。乃于九月十二日，由长春附近、四平、开原等地出动，经过长途行军，在北宁线上展开了秋季攻势。我军一部首先突然奔袭锦（州）榆（关）段，截断与分别包围兴城、沙后所、绥中等地之敌，另部则破袭昌（黎）滦（县）段，迟滞华北敌军东援。同时，我军再以一部由沟帮子、台安之线，进至锦州、义县间，截断义县敌军退路，并将该敌包围。九月二十八、二十九两日，我军相继攻克绥中、兴城，歼敌六千余，截断锦西、兴城间敌之联系，从而箝制了锦西、葫芦岛敌之五十四军，并吸引了敌暂六十二师由锦州增援锦西。我另部则歼灭由锦州向北出动之敌两个多团，占领锦州城东北及以北之主要外围阵地，并以炮火封锁了锦州西郊机场。同时，我军另一支部队从锦州以南插至高桥、塔山之线，攻占塔山及西海口，截断锦州、锦西间联系。十月一日，我军攻克义县，歼敌一个整师。于是，东北敌之主要补给基地锦州，乃处于我军重重包围之中。
    当敌感到锦州危急时，即由沈阳空运其四十九军增援，但仅运到七十九师之两个团，机场即不能继续使用。蒋贼介石深感锦州战局关系东北整个匪军的命运，乃急忙飞平飞沈，亲自指挥。蒋介石计划从两个方面来救援锦州。一个方面是从华北抽调其六十二军全部、华北“剿总”直辖之独九十五师与九十二军之二十一师，及胶东烟台之三十九军两个师，陆续海运葫芦岛登陆，加上其原驻锦西、葫芦岛之五十四军三个师、附暂六十二师共四个师，总计十一个师兵力，企图由锦西向北驰援锦州。另一个方面是将主力之主力新一军、新六军各两个师另一个团、新三军全部、七十一军两个师、四十九军之一○五师及一个团、原五十二军之一九五师与三个骑兵旅，组织所谓“廖耀湘西进兵团”，由沈阳倾巢出动，占我彰武，企图截断我后方补给线，威胁我攻锦部队，并策应长春孤城之敌向南突围。而我军则以强大阻击兵团，采取阵地坚守与运动防御，抗击南北两路增援之敌，并歼其一万二千余名。尤以我锦南阻击部队，左凭渤海，右以虹螺岘为倚托，在塔山、虹螺岘之线，对敌进行为时七昼夜之英勇阻击，抗拒以海空支援来犯之敌六个师，阵地屹立不动，使敌无法寸进，始终拒敌于离锦州仅三四十里之塔山附近地区，保证了我攻锦部署就绪与充分完成了准备工作，对我攻占锦州起了决定的作用。十月九日至十三日，我攻锦部队以五昼夜的英勇战斗，尽扫锦州外围据点，构筑蜘蛛网式的交通沟接近敌人，直逼锦州城下。最后，我军于十四日十一时，对锦州十万守敌发起总攻，迅速完成突破，并以大胆勇猛之渗透战术，插入敌之纵深，完全打烂敌之部署，分割敌人，各个围歼敌之强固据点。经三十一小时激战，即将守敌全部歼灭，敌范汉杰、卢浚泉以下十万之众，无一漏网。从此，东北余敌乃全部动摇。
    （二）锦州大捷后，蒋匪阵营引起极大震动，乃有长春守军六十军之起义，与新七军之全部投降。被我久围长春孤城之九万敌军，士气异常沮丧，自六月以来，在各次战斗中被我歼灭四千余众。同时，由于我军之强大政治攻势，并争取其一万八千余官兵逃出苦海，向我投诚。当我秋季攻势发动后，我围城部队仍严密布防，连营数百里，将敌重重围困。我军攻锦州时，敌曾作试探突围之举，均为我军击退，不能越雷池一部。最后，蒋贼介石乃严令该敌突围南逃。是时，云南部队六十军在我锦州大捷声威下，即由军长曾泽生领导，毅然起义。因而敌新七军及其杂色部队四万余人，更形混乱，其下级官兵则争先恐后向我投诚，终于逼使敌东北“剿总”副总司令兼第一兵团司令郑洞国及新七军军长李鸿等，不得不于十九日率部全体放下武器。长春乃告解放。
    （三）此时，徘徊于彰武与新立屯之敌廖耀湘兵团，既未能解锦州之围，又未达策应长春守敌南逃之目的。东北的某些高级匪首曾拟令该兵团退守新民、沈阳，或转向营口逃窜，但蒋贼介石却妄以我军经过锦州大攻坚战后，不能迅速继续作战，并错误地估计我军将乘胜南下，于是，在其再度飞沈时，竟盲目指挥廖兵团续沿北宁线西进，并令杜聿明设指挥所于葫芦岛，企图南北夹击，重占锦州。敌廖兵团全部及其再由新民增调前来之整二○七师第三旅（相当于师），并附以重炮及装甲车部队，在空军支援下，于二十四、五两日，集中全力，向我黑山、打虎山以北阵地猛犯，但遭我军坚强阻击，两日未获寸进。其时，我攻锦得胜之师，秘密神速东移，到达集结位置。二十五日黄昏后，该敌又企图取道台安、盘山，改向营口逃窜，复因我军截击不逞。蒋贼介石见事不好，又仓皇飞沈亲自指挥，令廖兵团向东突围。不意我北面主力部队如飞将军从天而降，于二十五、六两日，先后将敌后路打断。于是，敌军遂陷入走头无路之绝境。我军乃于二十六日晨起，在遍布水泊之饶阳河、柳河地区，开始巨大规模之围歼战。各部指战员奋其神勇，不顾疲劳，迅速分割敌人，重重围歼，以猛打猛冲猛追的三猛战术，于两昼夜之战斗中将全部美械化之廖耀湘兵团完全歼灭。生擒匪首廖耀湘以下八万余人。
    （四）廖兵团全军覆没后，沈阳敌巢更加裸露。匪东北“剿总”之少数高级官员自卫立煌起，先后乘飞机逃跑。我军则以不停止的追击，向沈阳、营口飞速进军。沈阳之敌，当廖兵团企图沿北宁线西进之时，即已于二十四日以其五十二军占我营口，图取得由海上逃走之路。其整二零七师之第一旅、第二旅，此时亦已逃抵辽阳、鞍山，敌为掩护其沈阳空运，乃又将其调回沈阳，与五十三军之三个师、及由台安逃回之暂五十三师，加上“剿总”直辖之各特种部队与三个骑兵旅、四个守备总队等部，统归敌第八兵团司令周福成指挥，图守沈阳。我军则自辽西打虎山战场及长春以南，毫不休停地一口气连续急行军数百里，横截及猛击逃敌，并向沈阳进攻。二十九、三十两日，相继收复新民、铁岭、抚顺、本溪、辽阳、鞍山、海城等城，歼灭逃敌五十三军一个师又一团及两个守备总队等部，大军直薄沈阳与营口。二十九日，我占领沈阳东陵飞机场。三十一日四时，我军在铁西区开始突破，守敌第八兵团司令部以下纷纷请降。仅其党化部队之整二零七师，仍作垂死挣扎，至十一月二日下午四时，为我全部解决。沈阳战斗历时仅二日，全歼守敌十万。至此，被敌侵占两年七个月零二十天之东北最大工业城市，拥有人口一百八十万之沈阳城，乃告完全解放。而我进攻营口之部队，亦以炮火击毙登轮逃窜之敌三千余，并于二日十一时，全歼市区之敌五十二军第二师、及二十五师之一个团、与该军直属之人力运输团等部，解放要港营口。其徘徊于锦西、葫芦岛狭窄滩头及承德孤城之敌，则于十一月九日晚及十二日正午先后仓皇逃遁。至此，东北敌军全部覆灭，东北十省（包括热河省及内蒙自治区）均获解放。我东北战场历时三年之伟大人民解放战争，获得了全部、彻底的胜利。
