[Taiyue Electric] Chai Ge Da Village in Yangcheng is accumulating fertilizer in preparation for next year's great production. The village is located in the mountains south of the city, mainly planting autumn crops. The whole village, in addition to 182 mu of wheat land, has a total of 2,799 mu of spring land. During the Three Autumn Campaign, the county government called on mountain villages to accumulate fertilizer before autumn, preparing 70 percent of the spring fertilizer, in order to lay the foundation for next year's great production. Chai Ge Da Village has now successfully completed this task. The whole village has now chopped 23,113 piles of branches, which can be used to smoke 3,850 manure pits, producing 96,300 dan of manure. At 85 dan per mu, this can fertilize 1,133 mu of land. Secondly, the whole village has accumulated 29,837 dan of manure, which, at 60 dan per mu, can fertilize 497 mu. Thirdly, there is penned manure, with 39,555 dan accumulated, which, at 75 dan per mu, can fertilize 524 mu. In total, the village now has more than 160,000 dan of manure, enough for 2,154 mu of spring land next year, accounting for more than 75 percent of the village's spring land. For the remaining 600-plus mu lacking manure, the plan is to make oil cakes and trample penned manure to ensure sufficient manure for next spring.

[Taihang News] Village Head Wang Fuqun of Dongyitou Village in Gaoyi, while finishing the first plowing of the autumn land and starting the second plowing, immediately called on the masses to quickly seize the time to scrape old grass and compost manure, striving for a bigger harvest next year. He inspired everyone by saying, "Lazy people make the land lazy," "Don't be afraid the land won't grow, just fear there's no manure. Accumulate manure this winter, and next year's harvest will be assured. Quickly seize the time to scrape old grass and compost winter manure." Village Deputy Zhao Wuchen, Instructor Zhang Jinting, and militia member Zhao Fenglin took the lead. Zhao Wuchen has already scraped 30 cartloads of old grass in his spare time, enough to compost three large manure pens. Instructor Zhang Jinting and militia member Zhao Fenglin have also scraped enough old grass for 28 cartloads each. Under their leading influence, every household is now scraping old grass, creating a village-wide surge of scraping grass and composting manure. Everyone has scraped clean the old grass from the vacant land beside the village and the edges of the fields. Many people are going to the sides of the railway, more than two li away, to scrape. Wang Zhiwen and Han Zhiliang, both in their fifties, are competing to collect manure, each collecting three baskets of manure (about 60 jin) every morning. Zhiwen said: "The manure I collected last year was applied to the land east of the village. That land was very poor, yielding only four dou. This year, it yielded five bags per mu. People will starve if they don't have food to eat, and the land won't yield grain if it's not fertilized. In the future, whoever's land is fertile and yields more grain will benefit. Why not work hard to get manure?"

　　保证明春粪土充足
  　阳城柴疙瘩村大量积肥
  　刮老草，沤冬粪
    东驿头村家家户户卷入热潮
    【太岳电】阳城柴疙瘩村积肥，准备明年大生产。该村在城南大山里，主要是种秋，全村除麦地一百八十二亩外，共有春地二千七百九十九亩。在三秋运动中，县政府曾号召山里村庄秋前积肥，要准备百分之七十的春肥，以打下明年大生产基础。柴疙瘩村现已胜利地完成了这个任务。现在全村共刹圪枝二万三千一百一十三个，能薰粪三千八百五十窖，可出粪九万六千三百担，按每亩上八十五担，能上地一千一百三十三亩。其次，全村已积大粪二万九千八百三十七担，按每亩上六十担，能上四百九十七亩。第三，是圈粪，已积三万九千五百五十五担，按每亩上七十五担，能上五百二十四亩。总计全村现有的十六万多担粪，足够明年二千一百五十四亩春地用，占全村春地百分之七十五以上。其余六百多亩所缺的粪土，计划打油饼、踩圈粪，保证明春粪土充足。
    【太行讯】高邑东头村长王付群，在耕完头遍秋地正耕二遍当中，即号召群众赶快抓紧刮老草沤粪，争取明年多打粮。他启发大家说：“人懒地也懒”，“不怕地不长，光怕没有粪，今冬积下粪，明年丰收准，赶快抓紧刮老草，沤过冬粪。”村副赵五琛，指导员张金亭，民兵赵风林三人首先起了火车头作用。赵五琛在工作的空隙已刮了老草三十车，能沤三大圈粪。指导员张金亭，民兵赵风林每人也刮够二十八车老草。在他三人的带头影响下，现在家家户户刮开了老草，造成了全村刮草沤粪浪潮。大家把村边空地和地边上的老草刮光了，很多人就到二里多路外铁路两边去刮。五十多岁的王志文和韩志亮，二人比赛着拾粪，每早晨每人拾三筐粪（约六十斤）。志文说：“我去年拾的粪上到村东地里了，那地很赖，是四斗产量，今年每亩打了五布袋。人吃不上饭就要饿，地不上粪就不打粮，今后谁的地肥打粮多是自己的，为啥不好好闹粪呢？”
