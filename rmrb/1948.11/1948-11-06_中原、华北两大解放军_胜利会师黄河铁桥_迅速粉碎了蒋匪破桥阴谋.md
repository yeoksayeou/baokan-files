Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou Front, 4th (delayed dispatch) Frontline reporter reports on the process of the Central Plains and North China PLA forces capturing the Pinghan Railway Yellow River Iron Bridge and joining forces on the bridge: On October 24th, the third day after the liberation of Zhengzhou, parts of our Central Plains and North China PLA forces simultaneously launched attacks on the enemy bridgehead fortifications north of the Yellow River Iron Bridge in Zhengzhou. To protect this nationally renowned and important transportation structure built with the people's blood, sweat, and wisdom from being destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit troops, the two PLA forces advanced rapidly towards the bridgehead from the north and south, with the sound of artillery fire echoing from both banks. At 7:00 PM, a certain unit of the Central Plains PLA on the south bank, with a swift attack, destroyed the enemy's group fortifications and bunker clusters, captured the south bank station, and annihilated two battalions of the 318th Regiment of the enemy's 40th Army. The remaining enemy troops attempted to blow up the iron bridge while fleeing in panic. However, at this time, a certain unit of the North China PLA also captured the north bank station, attacking from both sides and swiftly crushing the enemy's plot to destroy the bridge, victoriously joining forces on the bridge. Thus, the Yellow River Iron Bridge, this strategic transportation artery connecting North China and the Central Plains, was completely controlled by the People's Liberation Army. The two major liberated areas of the North and South were further connected into one. When the PLA liberated the south bank station, more than 300 employees from the station master down did not leave their posts. After learning about the PLA's policies, they immediately resumed work and drove two trains to the enemy's warehouses, transporting the captured military supplies for the PLA.

　　中原、华北两大解放军
  　胜利会师黄河铁桥
    迅速粉碎了蒋匪破桥阴谋
    【新华社郑州前线四日电】（迟到）前线记者报导中原、华北两大解放军攻占平汉铁路黄河大铁桥、会师桥上的经过称：郑州解放的第三天，十月二十四日，我中原、华北两大解放军各一部同时向郑州以北黄河大铁桥的敌桥头堡垒发动攻击。为保护这一全国驰名的、人民血汗与智慧所筑成的重要交通建筑不被国民党匪军所破坏，两支解放军在两岸炮声呼应下从南北两面向桥头急进。下午七时，南岸中原解放军某部，即以神速的攻击，摧毁了敌人的集团工事、地堡群，攻占了南岸车站，歼守敌四十军三一八团两个营。残敌于仓皇北逃时企图炸毁铁桥。但此时华北解放军某部也攻占了北岸车站，两面夹击，迅速粉碎了敌人破桥阴谋，胜利地会师桥上。至此，黄河大铁桥，这一华北与中原的战略交通要道，即为人民解放军完全掌握。南北两大解放区也更进一步连成了一片。当解放军解放南岸车站时，自站长以下三百余名员工均未离职，他们于闻悉解放军的政策后，马上自动复工，把两列火车开向敌人的仓库，为解放军运送缴获的军火物资。
