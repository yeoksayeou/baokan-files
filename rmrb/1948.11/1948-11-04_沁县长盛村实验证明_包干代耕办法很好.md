    【Taiyue Telegram】The Qinxian County Party Committee and County Government, in order to solve the difficulties of military families, have experimented with a contracted system of labor assistance to military families. This method is: based on the actual manpower and livestock in the village available for assisting military families with labor, the total amount of land in the village that needs to be cultivated on behalf of military families is divided equally, and specific people are assigned to cultivate the land. Those responsible for cultivating the land must hand over enough grain each year according to the assessed yield (this yield is assessed by the military family support committee based on land quality, the amount of fertilizer applied, and what crops are planted). If the land yields less than the assessed amount, the person cultivating on behalf of the military family is responsible for making up the difference (except in the case of special disasters). Any surplus belongs to the person cultivating on behalf of the military family. In order to promote full implementation, an experiment was first conducted in Changsheng Village. The process is now introduced below for reference in various locations:

    First, the following two shortcomings of past work in support of military families were examined: 1. Average care. 2. The masses were afraid of having many households and much land to support, so they deliberately overestimated the labor of military families to reduce the number of households and amount of land to be supported.

    The main reasons for the above situation were: cadres did not seriously take on the task of supporting military families, and some of the masses lacked understanding. Based on these circumstances, it was decided to separately convene meetings of military families, village cadres, evaluation committee members, and mass meetings to educate them on the policy of supporting military families. At the meetings of military, cadre, and martyr families, they were mobilized to organize themselves, actively participate in labor if they had the labor force, and overcome difficulties. For example, if the labor force was insufficient, after self-reporting and public discussion, only those deemed truly in need of support by the masses could receive it, etc. At the village cadre, evaluation committee, and mass meetings, it was emphasized that everyone should earnestly implement the policy of supporting military families. Military families who were poor and lacked labor should be well taken care of by cultivating on their behalf in order to consolidate the troops and improve the morale of the soldiers.

    At the beginning of the evaluation, the leadership did not put forward a specific standard, so there was a lot of controversy during the discussion. For example, in the case of military family Li Erkui, some people said he should receive labor support, and others said he should not, but none could give more specific reasons. At this time, the leadership put forward a concrete accounting method of calculating population, labor, land, income, and expenses. As a result, Li Erkui's family could earn 19 stone, 9 dou, and 2 sheng of miscellaneous grains per year. If they hired one and a half laborers, it would cost 3 stone of millet in wages, plus 1 stone and 8 dou of millet for the laborer's food and drink, totaling 4 stone and 8 dou of millet, which is equivalent to 9 stone and 6 dou of grain. They would have 10 stone and 3 dou and 2 sheng of miscellaneous grains left. If each family member consumed 3 dou of miscellaneous grains per month, the whole family would need 14 stone and 4 dou per year. Adding the burden and other expenses, it would not be enough. At this time, everyone unanimously agreed that he should receive labor support. Later, some people suggested that military families with young and middle-aged women could spin, weave, do needlework, and exchange labor with others, and there was no need for labor support. The leadership then educated everyone to have an attitude of considering others as they would consider themselves. Everyone has a wife at home, and comparing them would make it clear. Although women's labor can solve many problems, there are also some difficulties that cannot be solved. Finally, the village evaluated eleven households that should receive labor support, totaling 83 mu, 7 fen, and 3 li of land.

    The allocation of labor support land is as follows: 1. First, the evaluation committee, based on the general situation of rural crop cultivation, assesses that each mu requires an average of 8 units of human labor and 2.5 units of animal labor per year. Further, it divides the land into three different grades according to its distance, with more labor for distant land and less for nearby land. It is determined that distant land requires 10 units of human labor and 3 units of animal labor per mu; medium land requires 8 units of human labor and 2.5 units of animal labor; and nearby land requires 6 units of human labor and 2 units of animal labor. The above totals 83 mu, 7 fen, and 3 li of land, requiring 708 units of human labor and 218 units of animal labor. 2. The village actually has 120 men and 27 livestock obligated to provide assistance. Each person must cultivate 4 fen and 3 li of distant land, 5 fen and 3 li of medium land, and 6 fen and 9 li of nearby land on behalf of military families. Livestock counts double. 3. Except for seeds and fertilizers, which are the responsibility of the military families, everything else is the responsibility of the households cultivating on their behalf. Before sowing each year, the evaluation committee assesses the yield based on the amount of fertilizer applied by the military family, the quality of the soil, and what crops are planted. If there are no special disasters or losses, the person responsible for cultivating on behalf of the military family must hand over grain according to the fixed yield, and make up for any shortfall. 4. For some large plots of land that cannot be divided, each can cultivate their own part, which can be allocated by the evaluation committee or voluntarily combined by several people. Long-term or short-term laborers can be settled at the time of accounting. 5. If labor power is reduced due to illness, death, joining the army, taking a job, or buying or selling livestock, others can be assigned to cultivate on their behalf. Those who buy livestock or increase the number of people can be settled at the time of accounting. After this decision, the military families and the masses responded very well. The mother of military family Li Erkui said: "This year's method is better than last year's. It guarantees that the land won't be wasted, and there will be grain to eat after the autumn harvest!" Some said: "We must apply more fertilizer so as not to let down the people cultivating on our behalf." The masses said: "We have been assigned land to support military families, and we will work hard on it, working on it like our own land, and we must not yield less grain after the autumn harvest." The advantages of this method are: First, it saves manpower because the land is allocated to each person, and the masses can cultivate it in a planned way without wasting time. Second, there is no fear of the land being wasted. Third, military families need to run around and worry less. Fourth, cadres do not need to allocate labor piecemeal, but just need to check and supervise, which also saves time. (Wei Kezhong)

### 沁县长盛村实验证明  包干代耕办法很好

    沁县长盛村实验证明
    包干代耕办法很好
    【太岳电】沁县县委和县政府为了解决军属困难，试行了包干制的劳力优军办法。这种办法是：按全村实有应服劳力优军的人力和牲畜，平分全村应代耕的土地总数，固定专人耕种土地。负责耕种的人，每年按评定的应产量（这个产量是按土地好坏，上粪多少和种什么庄稼等条件由优军评委会评定的。）交够粮食，地里打不够，由代耕的人负责补够（要是有特殊的灾荒例外），多打了归代耕的人得。为了推动全面执行，先在长盛村作了一个实验。现在把经过介绍如下，以供各地参考：
    首先检讨出过去优军工作有以下两个毛病：一、平均的照顾。二、群众害怕优待的户数多、土地多，故意过高的估计军属的劳力，减少被优待的户数和土地。
    发生以上情况的主要原因是：干部没有认真负起优军任务，部分群众认识不够，根据这些情况，就决定分别召开军属会和村干部会、评议员会、群众大会等进行优军政策的教育。在军、干、烈属会议上，动员军属组织起来，有劳力的积极参加劳动，克服困难。如劳力不足，经过自报公议，群众通过，认为真正需优待者才能受到优待等。在村干和评委会、群众大会上，强调提出大家要认真执行优军政策，凡是家里贫苦，没有劳力的军属，一定要好好的代耕，以巩固部队提高战士情绪。
    在开始评议时，领导上没有具体提出一个标准，因此在讨论时，就发生了很大争论。象军属李二奎家，有的人说该劳力优待，有的人说不该劳力优待，可是都说不出更具体的理由。这时候领导上提出来算人口、算劳力、算土地、算收入、算开支的具体算帐办法，结果李二奎家里全年能收入十九石九斗二升杂粮，要是雇一个半个雇工用上三石小米的工，再加上一石八斗小米的雇工吃喝，共需四石八斗小米，折成九石六斗谷子，还剩下十石零三斗二升杂粮，全家每人每月按三斗杂粮计算，全年要吃十四石四斗，再加上负担和别的开支，就更不够用了。这时候大家才一致认为他应该受到劳力优待。以后又有人提出军属家里只要有青壮年妇女，可以纺花、织布、做针工和别人变工的，用不着受劳力优待。领导上就教育大家要有看别人想自己的态度，自己家里也有老婆，比一下就可知道。妇女劳动虽然也能解决很多问题，可是也有些困难就没有法解决。最后全村评议出该受劳力优待的十一户，共土地八十三亩七分三厘。
    劳力优待土地的分配是：一、先由评委会根据农村种庄稼的一般情况，评定每亩全年平均需用人工八个，畜工两个半。进一步又根据土地的远近划分了三等不同的等级，远地加工，近地减工。确定远地每亩人工十个，畜工三个；中地人工八个，畜工二个半；近地人工六个，畜工两个。以上共计八十三亩七分三厘地，需人工七百零八个，畜工二百一十八个。二、全村实有服代耕义务的男人一百廿名，牲口二十七头。每个人要代耕远地是四分三厘，中地是五分三厘、近地是六分九厘。牲口加一倍。三、除了种子、肥料由军属负责以外，别的都由代耕户本人负责。每年下种前根据军属上粪多少，土质好坏，和种啥庄稼，由评议委员会评定产量，要是没有特殊的灾荒和损失，负责代耕的人就要按固定的产量交粮，长得短补。四、有些大块土地不能分开的，可各种各的，由评委会分配或自愿结合几个人伙种。长工或短工可在结帐时找清。五、如因疾病死亡，或参军、参加工作，或买卖牲口，人畜力减少了，可以指定别人负责代耕。买下牲口或是增加了人数的可在结帐时找清。这样决定以后，军属和群众反映很好。军属李二奎母亲说：“今年的办法比去年好，保证荒不了，秋地后有粮吃啦！”有的说：“我们一定要多多上粪，不能亏了代耕的人。”群众说：给咱分上优待地，自己好好闹，跟自己的地一样干，秋后不能少打粮食。这个办法的优点：第一、是节省民力，因为土地分到每人名下，群众能有计划的去耕种，不浪费时间。第二、不怕地荒了。第三、军属少跑腿少操心。第四、干部不用零碎拨工，只是检查督促，也节省时间。              （魏克忠）
