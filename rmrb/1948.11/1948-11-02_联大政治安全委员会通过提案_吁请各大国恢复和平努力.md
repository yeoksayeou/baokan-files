Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: TASS, Paris: The Political and Security Committee of the UN General Assembly unanimously passed a Mexican proposal on the afternoon of the 22nd, namely, that the current UN General Assembly call on major powers to resume efforts to eliminate differences and establish lasting peace. The proposal also requested the General Assembly to state that "the policy followed by the Allied powers should be in accordance with the spirit of the Crimea Declaration (i.e., the Yalta Agreement)," and urged the signatory countries of the Moscow Agreement of December 1945 to "redouble their efforts in a spirit of unity and understanding to conclude all peace treaties as soon as possible." Soviet representative Mr. Bogomolov stated before the vote that the Soviet delegation supported the Mexican proposal because the call for strengthening universal peace and eliminating differences between countries would naturally receive the sympathy of the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet delegation believed that peace efforts could only succeed if all countries strictly adhered to their obligations in international agreements. US representative Dulles, in his speech on the 21st, emphasized that the proposal was only a general appeal and not an "instruction," thereby making a specific reservation about "the US government's sympathy for the basic principles of the Mexican proposal."

    联大政治安全委员会通过提案
    吁请各大国恢复和平努力
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：联大政治安全委员会于廿二日下午一致通过墨西哥的提案，即由本届联合国大会吁请各大国恢复消除分岐与建立持久和平的努力。该提案并要求大会表示，“盟国所遵循的政策，应依照克里米亚宣言（即雅尔达协定）的精神”，并敦促一九四五年十二月莫斯科协定的签字国“以团结与谅解精神，加倍努力以尽早缔结一切和约”。苏代表鲍格莫洛夫在表决前发表声明称：苏联代表团赞成墨西哥的建议，因为加强普遍和平及消除各国间分岐的呼吁，自将得到苏联的同情。但苏联代表团认为，只有在各国严格遵守其在国际协定中义务的条件下，和平的努力才能成功。美代表杜勒斯在二十一日的发言中，强调该提案只是一般的呼吁，而不是“指令”，从而对“美国政府同情墨西哥提案的基本原则”作了具体的保留。
