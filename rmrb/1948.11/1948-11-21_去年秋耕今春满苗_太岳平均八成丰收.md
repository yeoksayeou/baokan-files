　　Autumn Cultivation Last Year, Full Seedlings This Spring
  　Taiyue Achieves an Average of 80% Harvest
    [Taiyue Telegraph] The Taiyue region has achieved a bumper harvest in most areas this year. The average harvest for the entire region is 80%, with an average yield of one "shi" per "mu" for various autumn grains, an increase of 8.8 "he" per "mu" compared to the average yield after the war. The total grain increase for the region is approximately 600,000 "shi," reaching over 80% compared to the average yield before the war. Based on different harvest situations, the region can be roughly divided into three types of areas. The first type, with harvests above 80%, includes seven counties: Yangcheng, Gaoping, Anze, Qinyuan, Qinshui, Yicheng, etc. In Yangshu Village, Yangcheng, millet yielded 1.25 "shi" per "mu" last year, and 1.6 "shi" this year, an increase of 0.345 "shi"; corn yielded 0.75 "shi" per "mu" last year, and 1.06 "shi" this year, an increase of 0.256 "shi." The second type, with harvests above 70%, includes six counties: Qin County, Tunliu, Changzi, Huo County, Fushan, Jincheng, etc. For example, in Xiduan Village, Qin County, the yield was 0.88 "shi" per "mu" last year and 1.08 "shi" per "mu" this year, an increase of 0.2 "shi." The third type includes counties such as Yuanqu, Meng County, and Lingshi, all with a 60% harvest. Among the various autumn grains in the region, millet and corn had relatively better yields. In some areas of Yangcheng, the millet harvest is approaching 100%, such as in the second district, where the average yield of millet per "mu" is 1.64 "shi."

    The reason for achieving an 80% harvest this year is primarily due to favorable natural conditions, with moderate wind and rain, coupled with good leadership in various areas. Last year, most autumn land underwent autumn cultivation, ensuring full seedlings. After the beginning of summer, there were only a few days of drought in June, and various areas conducted drought prevention work under leadership. Secondly, it is attributed to the completion of land reform, with landless and land-poor peasants obtaining land. On this basis, the left-leaning deviations were resolutely corrected, and the Party's production policies were deeply publicized, stabilizing and encouraging the masses' enthusiasm for production. At the beginning of spring, because the error of the purely "poor peasant and farm laborer line" last winter had not been corrected in various places, the production enthusiasm of all classes was low. Although it had reached the cultivation season, no one in various places was delivering manure; on the contrary, there were quite serious phenomena of selling cattle, slaughtering sheep, and eating and drinking lavishly. A middle peasant in Qinshui said: "Eating and drinking is a profit, not eating and drinking is a loss." Many plots were cultivated and sown carelessly. Some people sowed grain seeds without applying manure, and what used to be accumulated fertilizer every year was just kicked this year. Based on these circumstances, the leadership at the time took resolute measures, corrected the left-leaning deviations, and rectified the policies. Only then did the production of all classes improve. For example, after Yangcheng Nanciying initially corrected the deviations and returned more than 110,000 yuan of share capital, everyone happily said: "Chairman Mao's policy has come to our village!" The whole village immediately started delivering manure, delivering nearly 50,000 loads in a few days. At a mass meeting in Chengguan, Tunliu District, the announcement that the class status of 98 wrongly classified middle peasant households would be reclassified was greeted by cheers of "Good!" Facts prove: where policies are rectified and middle peasants are united, production is vigorous; where this is not done, production is lax. For example, in Jia and Panhe villages in Qinshui, because the correction of deviations was very poor, the weeds in some people's fields grew taller than the crops. In Dianyao Village, Yangcheng, because the correction of deviations was relatively thorough, after a four-finger rain on the morning of June 5th, all groups mobilized to rush to plant late crops in the afternoon, planting 269.7 "mu" in half a day, and even the 82-year-old Wang Fenggang went to the fields. At the same time, the deviations of the mutual aid teams were corrected. For example, Jincheng corrected the forced combination of three-household mutual aid, and the Second Special District corrected the involuntary and unequal value deviations in the mutual aid teams, generally implementing voluntary combination and equal value exchange. In this way, during weeding, general processing and weeding were achieved, and most of the autumn seedlings in the region were weeded twice, and some were weeded three times, and some were also top-dressed. This year, the labor service was relatively reduced, enabling farmers to concentrate more on cultivation, which also helped a lot.

　　去年秋耕今春满苗
  　太岳平均八成丰收
    【太岳电】太岳今年大部地区丰收。全区平均八成收成，各种秋禾每亩平均收一石，与战后常年产量比较，每亩增产八升八合。全区共增产粮食约六十万石多，与战前常年产量比较，达百分之八十强。按不同的收成情形，大致可分三种类型地区。第一种地区收成八成以上的，计有阳城、高平、安泽、沁源、沁水、翼城等七县。阳城阳恕村谷子去年每亩收一石二斗五，今年收一石六斗，增产三斗四升五；玉茭去年每亩收七斗五，今年收一石零六合，增产二斗五升六合。第二种地区收七成以上的，计有沁县、屯留、长子、霍县、浮山、晋城等六县，如沁县西段庄去年每亩收八斗八、今年每亩收一石零八升，增产二斗。第三种地区，计有垣曲、孟县、灵石等县，均六成收。全区各种秋禾以谷子、玉茭收成较好，阳城有些地方谷子已接近十成收成，如二区谷子每亩平均收一石六斗四升。
    今年所以能够达到八成收成，首先是自然条件好，风雨调匀，加上各地领导的好，去年有绝大部分秋地经过秋耕，保证了满苗；入夏以后，仅六月间曾旱过几天，各地都领导进行了防旱工作。其次即归功于完成了土改，无地少地的农民获得了土地，在这个基础上，又坚决纠正了左偏，深入宣传了我党的生产政策，安定与鼓舞了群众的生产热情，在开春时，由于去冬单纯“贫雇路线”的错误在各地未曾得到纠正，各阶层生产情绪低落，虽已到达耕种时期，但各地还没有人送粪；相反的发生了相当严重的卖牛、杀羊、大吃大喝等现象。沁水中农说：“吃吃喝喝是赚头，不吃不喝是赔头”。不少地粗耕粗种，有些人不上粪就把谷种上了，往时年年垒＠，今年用脚踢踏就算了。根据这些情况，当时领导上便采取了坚决的措施，纠正了左倾偏向，端正了政策，各阶层生产才有了起色。如阳城南次营经过初步纠偏，归还了十一万多块钱股金后，大家欢喜的说：“这是毛主席的政策来咱村了”，全村马上忙着开始送粪，几天就送了近五万担。屯留一区城关开大会刚宣布对九十八户误斗中农改订成份，群众就欢呼“好呀”！事实证明：哪里端正了政策，团结了中农，哪里就生产有劲，哪里没有这样作，哪里生产就稀松。如沁水嘉、潘河等村，因为纠偏很差，有些群众地里的草就比庄稼长的还高。阳城殿腰村因为纠偏比较彻底，六月初五上午刚下了四指雨，下午各组全体出动抢种晚庄稼，半天就种了二百六十九亩七分，连八十二岁的老汉王凤岗也上了地。同时因为纠正了互助组的偏向。如晋城纠正了强编的三合互助，二专署纠正了互助组中的不自愿不等价等偏向，一般实行了自愿结合等价交换，这样在锄苗时一般做到加工加锄，全区秋苗绝大部分锄了二遍，一部锄了三遍，有的还上了追肥。而今年差务相对减少，使农民更能集中精力从事耕作，亦帮助不小。
