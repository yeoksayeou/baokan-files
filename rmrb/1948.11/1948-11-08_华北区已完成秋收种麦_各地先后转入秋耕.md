[Report from Our Newspaper] Comprehensive reports from various locations indicate that from the end of September to October, the North China Region has successively transitioned from autumn harvesting and wheat planting to autumn cultivation. The slogans in the Jinan, Jilu Yu regions are to strive to plow all the bare land once before the ground freezes, with particular emphasis on areas that have experienced drought and insect plagues. The Regional Party Committee and Administrative Office have called on cadres at all levels to grasp the leadership firmly. Many villages in counties such as Changzhi in the Taihang Region, which started earlier and had better leadership, completed this work by mid-October. In some areas of Huailai County in the North Yue Region, where there has traditionally been no habit of autumn cultivation, the practice has begun this year due to vigorous publicity and advocacy from the leadership, which has enabled the masses to generally understand the many benefits of autumn cultivation, such as reducing pests and conserving moisture. In many villages in Liangxiang County, even donkeys and mules that have never plowed before have been harnessed. In order to promote the widespread implementation of autumn cultivation in counties such as Licheng and Wuxiang in the Taihang Region, some districts or joint defense villages have organized special inspection teams to visit villages, understand the difficulties in autumn cultivation, provide specific assistance, and disseminate good experiences in a timely manner. The most important issue encountered in autumn cultivation in various regions is the mobilization and organization of livestock. According to reports from several counties in Taihang and Taiyue, on the one hand, this is because support for the front lines or having more land than livestock means they cannot plow it all; on the other hand, many farmers with livestock are unwilling to let their livestock plow land for others. The reasons for this are that livestock wages were too low in the past (the leadership used this to take care of poor farmers without livestock), or some households have owed livestock wages for a long time; some have more profitable sidelines such as transporting coal, or are busy grinding flour and rice at home. The solutions to these problems in places like Xiyang, Heshun, Zuoquan, and Tunliu are, on the one hand, to appropriately increase livestock wages through democratic appraisal (Laiyuan in North Yue and Zaoqiang in South Hebei also regard allowing both parties to freely negotiate prices or hire freely as a viable solution), so that the profits are roughly balanced with transportation and other sidelines, and on the other hand, to seriously clear up accumulated wages so that households with livestock do not suffer losses. Some farmers are afraid that others will damage their livestock, so in mutual aid groups and work exchange teams, they elect the most skilled veteran farmers to operate the plow, relieving the concerns of livestock owners. For some farmers who value slightly higher profits from transportation, they are told that autumn cultivation is seasonal and transportation can be done at any time. For those grinding rice and flour, people are organized to replace them with manual labor, freeing up livestock for plowing. In this way, most or all of the livestock are organized into autumn cultivation. Xiyang once organized villages with more livestock and less land to quickly complete autumn cultivation in their own villages in a planned manner, and then go out to sell their services. However, according to reports from the Seventh District of Wuxiang, some farmers without livestock are unwilling to pay wages and are preparing to postpone plowing until next spring. The leadership then told them: you have to plow sooner or later, so it is better to plow now so that you can harvest more grain next year. This clarified the thinking of many people, and they began to find livestock to plow the land and stopped waiting. For some very difficult elderly and widowed households, they are mobilized to actively seek relationships with relatives and friends or exchange livestock labor with sewing, washing, spinning, and straw, so as not to miss the season. In Jinzhong, where support for the front lines is a heavy task, many places organize people to pull plows and dig the ground, which also solves some problems. Secondly, in counties such as Pingshun, many village cadres are afraid of repeating the mistake of commandism and upsetting the masses, so they abandon their responsibilities and do not organize the masses to take action. The leadership clearly pointed out that it is wrong to force the masses to harvest unripe crops early in order to strive for autumn cultivation models, but it is necessary to help lead the masses to solve various difficulties. In this way, the confidence of cadres in many villages has been improved, and there have been many changes in their work style: they have begun to discuss with the masses to solve various difficulties, and go deep into the households in different streets and areas to persuade the masses to actively cultivate in the autumn. Thirdly, some of the masses still have the idea of ​​waiting for the equal distribution of land or subsidies for land, fearing that they will plow in vain. Generally, all localities have publicized the achievements of land reform in response to this idea, explaining that the feudal system has been eliminated or basically eliminated, and land rights will no longer change; even if there are changes, they will be adjustments within a small range, and farmers are advised not to lose big because of small things. In this way, the mood of production is generally stabilized. Those who correctly ended the land reform before autumn and issued land certificates were in even higher spirits. However, none of the above problems have been completely resolved. For example, in some villages in Xiyang, the issue of livestock wages has not been completely and fairly negotiated, but village cadres took the lead and put their own livestock on the harness first, so that other livestock owners were forced to follow suit and plow for others at lower wages. On the surface, all the livestock were mobilized, but in reality they were not very willing. In terms of cadres' work style, some have reused the formalism and commandism of the past. For example, in Dongshang Village, Wuxiang, people were allowed to cook in large pots and eat collectively during autumn cultivation, in Xiyadie Village, Zuoquan, people were forced to plow at night, and in Shanye Village, Licheng, two livestock were exhausted due to crash efforts. They felt that they could not show their leadership role in this way, which repeated the mistakes of last year. Many districts and villages in Tunliu, Pingshan and other counties have relaxed their leadership of autumn cultivation because they are engaged in autumn conscription. They are not good at specific division of labor, and complete various tasks in a planned and step-by-step manner. In some villages in Jinzhong, because many livestock have left to support the front lines, the village cadres believe that they cannot finish plowing anyway, and they do not actively lead. In some places in Jilu Yu and Taihang, the absolute egalitarianism errors that occurred in the work of ending land reform in some villages before autumn affected the mood of liberated farmers. In some places in each district, due to the lack of strong leadership and control in correcting deviations, "left" and right deviations occurred, affecting the uneasiness of the masses. The above shortcomings and errors have now attracted the attention of the leadership and are being addressed.

### 华北区已完成秋收种麦　各地先后转入秋耕

　　华北区已完成秋收种麦
  　各地先后转入秋耕
    【本报讯】综合各地报导，从九月末至十月份，华北区已先后由秋收种麦转入秋耕。冀南、冀鲁豫的口号，是争取上冻以前把白茬地普耕一遍。尤其着重发生过旱灾与虫灾的地区。区党委与行署均号召各级干部抓紧领导。太行区长治等县不少动手较早，领导较好的村庄，已于十月中旬完成。北岳区怀来等县有些地区历来没有秋耕习惯，今年也因领导上极力宣传倡导，使群众普遍了解了秋耕能减少虫害、保存水分等许多好处，开始实行秋耕。良乡县许多村庄连向来不耕地的驴骡也插了犋。太行黎城、武乡等县为推动秋耕普遍进行，有的区或联防村庄组织了专门的检查队分赴各村检查，了解秋耕中的困难，具体帮助解决，并及时传播好的经验。各地在秋耕中遇到的问题，最重要的是牲口的动员与组织使用问题。根据太行、太岳若干县份报导，一方面是由于支前或地多牲口少，耕不过来；一方面又有许多有牲口的农户不愿让自己牲口给别人耕地。其原因，有的是以前牲口工资太低（领导上以此照顾无牲口的贫苦农户），或有些户用了牲口拖欠工资很久；有的是有运煤等更有利的副业，或家里推面碾米不得闲。解决这些问题，昔阳、和顺、左权、屯留等地的办法是一方面经过民主评议，适当提高牲口工资（北岳的涞源与冀南的枣强则将完全由双方自由议价或自由雇用也作为可行的办法），使与运输等副业的利润大体平衡，一方面是认真清理积欠工资，使有牲口户不吃亏。有些农户怕别人使坏他的牲口，便在互助组与变工队中由大家公选最善于使用牲口的老农来掌犁，解除了有牲口户顾虑，对一些太看重运输等稍高利润的农户，则告诉他们秋耕有季节性，运输什么时候也能搞。对碾米推面的，则组织以人工去代替，腾出牲口来耕地。这样就把大部以至全部的牲口都组织到秋耕中来。昔阳曾组织牲口多、土地少的村庄有计划的迅速完成本村秋耕，然后出村卖晌。但据武乡七区反映，又有些无牲口的农户因不愿掏工资而准备把耕地推迟到明春。领导上便告诉他们：迟早都得耕，倒不如现在耕了明年能多收些粮食。这样弄通了不少人的思想，开始找牲口耕地，不再等待。对一些很困难的孤寡户，发动她们积极去找亲友关系或以缝洗纺织及谷草等换牲口工，使不致错过季节。晋中支前任务繁重，不少地方组织人拉犁与人刨地，也解决了部分问题。其次，平顺等县有不少村干部因为怕再犯命令主义错误，惹得群众不高兴，便放弃自己的责任，不去组织群众行动。领导上明确指出，如为争取秋耕模范而强令群众早割了未熟的庄稼是错误的，但帮助领导群众解决各种困难则是必须的。这样，许多村的干部提高了信心，作风上也有不少转变：他们开始和群众商量解决各种困难的办法，分街分片深入到农户中去说服群众，积极秋耕。再次，群众中部分的还存在着等待平分土地或抽补土地的思想，怕白耕了。各地一般都针对这种思想宣传了土改的成绩，说明封建制度已经消灭或基本消灭，地权不会再有变动；即使有变动，也属于小范围内的调剂，劝农民不要因小失大。这样，大体安定了生产情绪。有些秋前正确地结束了土改，颁发了土地证的，情绪就更高些。但以上这些问题，目前都还未完全解决。如昔阳有些村庄对牲口工资问题未彻底公平议价，而以村干部带头，先将自己牲口都上了套，使其他有牲口户也勉强跟着以较低工价给别人耕地，表面上牲口都动员起来了，实际不很自愿。干部作风上，有一些又沿用了过去的形式主义与命令主义作法。如武乡洞上村秋耕中让群众安大锅集体吃饭，左权西崖底村强叫群众夜耕，黎城善业村因突击而累坏两头牲口等，他们觉得不如此便不能表现领导作用，致重复了去年的错误。屯留、平山等县不少区村则有因搞秋征而放松领导秋耕的。他们不善于具体分工，有计划、有步骤的完成各种任务。晋中有些村庄因为牲口支前走了许多，村干部便认为反正耕不完，不积极领导。冀鲁豫、太行有一些地方因秋前部分村庄结束土改工作中发生绝对平均主义错误，影响翻身农民情绪不安。各区有些地方因纠偏中缺乏坚强的领导与掌握，发生了“左”的与右的偏向，影响群众不安。以上缺点与错误现已引起领导上注意，正设法克服。
