　　Please Help Dyeing Workers Find Employment
　　Dyeing technicians from Pingding County, Shanxi Province, have historically opened dyeing workshops in Shandong, Hebei, Rehe, and Northeast China. After the July 7th Incident, due to the destruction and oppression of the Japanese puppet regime, businesses closed down, and a large number of dyeing workers became unemployed and returned home. According to statistics from the 12th district of Pingding alone, there are 934 dyeing workers at home. It is estimated that there are thousands of such workers in the entire county. These people are still willing to go out to find employment, but they are suffering from having nowhere to turn. Now, the liberated areas of North China are actively restoring and developing production and construction. If these dyeing technicians can be appropriately introduced and placed, it will not only solve their employment and livelihood problems, but also be very necessary for carrying out the new democratic industrial construction. Therefore, we request the government to find ways to introduce employment to these dyeing workers, so that they can participate in industrial construction. At the same time, we also hope that dyeing and weaving factories and workshops in various places, if they need dyeing workers, can come to Pingding to hire them. The Pingding Construction Section will be responsible for introductions. (Wang Zizhong, Pingding County Construction Section)

　　请给染色工人介绍职业
    山西平定县染色技术工人，历来在山东、河北、热河、东北等地开染坊者很多。七七事变后，因日伪统治摧残，工商倒闭，染色工人大批失业回家。仅根据平定第十二区的统计，在家之染业工人就有九百三十四人，估计全县将有数千人之多。现在这些人仍愿出外就业，只苦于无处可投。现在华北解放区，正积极恢复与发展生产建设，如能将这些染色技术工人予以适当介绍按插，不但解决他们的职业与生活，并且对开展新民主主义的工业建设，也是非常需要的。为此，请政府能为这些染业工人设法介绍职业，使其参加工业建设。同时也希望各地染织工厂作坊，如需用染色工人时，可来平定聘请，平定建设科当负责介绍。（平定县建设科王子中）
