    [Taihang Telegram] The Wu'an Mule and Horse General Merchandise Fair, prepared to exchange goods for the large-scale production next year after the completion of land reform, began on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month and lasted for five days. The fair was very lively. According to statistics, the average daily attendance was around 50,000 people. On the ninth day, the main day of the fair, the number increased to over 100,000. In terms of commodity supply, in addition to the more than 700 public and private shops in Wu'an purchasing a large number of goods needed by the masses, merchants from more than ten counties including Huaiqing, Xingtai, Guangping, Qucheng, Changzhi, Jincheng, Handan, Linxian, Zuoquan, and Shexian also brought large quantities of goods to trade before the fair. According to incomplete statistics, there were more than 340 foreign stalls and shops of various sizes. Because the masses' purchasing power has gradually increased after emancipation, the goods prepared by the shops could not meet the demand. According to incomplete statistics on the ninth day alone, twenty ink and brush merchants sold 2.9 million yuan, over 4,800 catties of homespun cloth were sold, over 700 catties of copper and iron goods were sold, and 162 head of livestock were traded in a single day. Huachangde Paint Shop, which usually sells 300,000 to 400,000 yuan per day, sold over 2 million yuan on a single day during the fair. Sanxin Textile Factory, the County Cooperative, and the North Henan Store sold 630 bolts of native and foreign cloth. Many shops sold out all their goods in a single day. Merchants reflected, "Goods are being sold very quickly this year; even a month of preparation is not enough to sell." Some merchants who had foreign goods and luxury goods regretted, "Our goods are not right; no matter how much of the right goods there are, it wouldn't be enough to sell." It is estimated that the net profit of the merchants in Wu'an city alone during this conference was more than 100 million yuan.

    群众翻身购买力提高
    武安骡马会百货畅销
    【太行电】为交流物资准备土改完成后明年大生产的武安骡马百货大会，于阴历九月九日开始举行，历时五日，大会赶得很热闹。据统计每日上会人数平均五万左右。九日正会人数则增至十万余。在商品的供应上，除武安七百余家公私商店采购回大批群众所需物品外，怀庆、邢台、广平、曲周、长治、晋城、邯郸、林县、左权、涉县等十余县客商也于会前携带大宗货物来此交易。据不完全统计，共有外来大小摊贩商店三百四十余家。由于群众翻身后购买力逐渐提高，所以各商店所备货物供不应求。据九日这天不完全统计，二十个笔墨客商即卖洋二百九十万元，土布出售四千八百余斤，铜铁货七百余斤，牲口一日即成交一百六十二头。华昌德颜料庄平常日卖三十万到四十万元，此次会上一日卖了二百余万元；三新纺织厂、县联社及豫北商店即卖了土洋布六百三十匹，不少商店货物一日内全部售完。商人反映“今年下货真快，准备了一个月也不够卖”。一部分存有外货及奢侈品的商人则后悔的说：“咱的货不对头，对头的有多少也不够卖”。据估计，此次大会仅武安城关商人收入纯利即在一万万元以上。
