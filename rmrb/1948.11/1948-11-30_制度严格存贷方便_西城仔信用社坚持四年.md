　　Strict System, Convenient Savings and Loans
  　Xichengzai Credit Cooperative Persists for Four Years
    [North Yue News] The Xichengzai Village Credit Cooperative in Xingtang County was established in 1945 with the support of the village cooperative to solve the livelihood and production difficulties of the working masses during the spring plowing season. It has been operating for four years and has achieved considerable results in supporting agricultural production among the masses. In 1945, sixteen households deposited grain, storing 903 catties of millet and 1,978 catties of corn. It was loaned to two households lacking transportation and sales capital, six households solving the problem of seeds and livelihoods, and also supported a pottery workshop. In 1946, 1,727.5 catties of miscellaneous grains were stored, solving the livelihood problems of 41 peasant households. In 1947, 1,593.5 catties of miscellaneous grains were stored, loaned to 18 households. Last year was a lean year, with three households storing grain, totaling 1,821 catties and ten taels of miscellaneous grains. Therefore, even without government grain loans, the livelihood problems of 44 households were solved.
    In the past, there were more than 20 villages in the second district of Xingtang that had credit cooperatives, but now they have all collapsed. Only the credit cooperative in this village not only continues to exist but has also achieved new development. The main reasons are: 1. Borrowing and repaying. Grain borrowers all signed contracts with the credit cooperative and acted in accordance with the contracts. In the past four years, not a single household has failed to repay. 2. Democratic style, clear procedures, grain storage and lending are entirely based on mobilization and persuasion. Stored grain is not stored centrally; the grain borrowers directly take the grain from the grain storing households, and they also deliver it themselves when repaying. Credit cooperative cadres are responsible for weighing and checking the quality. 3. Timely distribution. Every year, loans are only given to farmers who have difficulties in their livelihoods when raising seeds in the spring and summer. In the past four years, not a single household has borrowed for non-essential purposes. 4. Clear production viewpoint, not lending to lazy people and loafers. In the first three years, the grain borrowers were all poor and hired peasants. This year, after the land was equally distributed, the landlords and rich peasants who were liquidated could also borrow if they worked hard in production and had livelihood difficulties. This year, 14 landlord and rich peasant households borrowed grain for production. 5. Good integration with preferential treatment for military personnel. There is a soldier in the village named Zhang Guotang (hired peasant), who has no family members. He has four mu of land (increased to twelve mu of dry land and half a mu of paddy field after equal distribution), which is farmed by fixed households on his behalf. Every year, the grain harvested, except for public grain and village expenses, is entirely handed over to the credit cooperative for storage, lending, and interest. In the past two years, Zhang Guotang has stored a total of 120 catties of wheat, 270 catties of millet and mung beans, and 891.5 catties of millet. In this way, the current production difficulties of the peasants are solved, and the future establishment of Zhang Guotang's family after demobilization is also solved. The grain stored last year and this year was stored in this way, with a total of two soldiers and one family of a martyr. The newly emancipated peasant Liu Deyu said: "In the past, landlords who lent money had to find wealthy people to be guarantors. Now, the credit cooperative serves the poor. If it weren't for the credit cooperative lending me grain in the past two years, the land would have been deserted, and people would have starved."
    However, upon review, the cooperative also has shortcomings. 1. The term is too long and too mechanical. Loans are only issued between spring and summer each year and repaid after the autumn harvest. It has not achieved continuous lending and repayment, so that stored grain can play a greater role. 2. The cadres only manage lending and repayment, and not enough organization and supervision of the production of grain borrowing households. The cooperative is now planning to combine these stored grains with the village cooperative's cotton gin and bow to serve as a fund to support the masses in carrying out winter textile production. It will be recovered next spring and used for agriculture again. (Shi Li)

　　制度严格存贷方便
  　西城仔信用社坚持四年
    【北岳讯】行唐县西城仔村信用合作社，是民国三十四年在村合作社的扶助下，为解决春耕时期劳动群众的生活与生产困难而设立的私人存贷信用组织，到现在经营了四年，在扶助群众农业生产上，收到相当效果。三十四年存粮的十六户，存小米九百零三斤，玉茭一千九百七十八斤，贷给了缺乏运销资本的两户，养种地决生活问题的六户，还扶持了一座缸坊。三十五年存杂粮一千七百二十七斤半，解决了四十一户农民的生活问题。三十六年存杂粮一千五百九十三斤半，贷给了十八户。去年是歉年，存粮的三户，共存杂粮一千八百二十一斤十两，所以虽无政府贷粮贷款，也解决了四十四户的生活问题。
    过去行唐二区有二十多个村庄有信用社，现在都垮了。只有这村的信用社不但坚持存在，而且有了新的发展。其原因主要是：一、有借有还。借粮户都与信用社订立契约，照契约办事。四年来没有一户还不了的。二、作风民主，手续清楚，存粮贷粮完全是动员说服。存粮不集中保存，由贷粮户直接到存粮户取粮，还时也是自己送交，信用社干部负责过秤并检查质量。三、发放及时。每年都是在春夏间发现农民养种地时生活有困难者才贷给。四来年没有一户是借非所用的。四、生产观点明确，不贷给懒汉二流子。前三年贷粮户都是贫雇，今年平分后，被清算的地富，只要努力生产，生活有困难者也可贷，今年即有十四户地富贷粮生产。五、与优军工作结合的好。该村有个战士叫张国堂（雇农），家里没人，有地四亩（平分后增至十二亩旱地半亩水地），固定户代耕，每年所收粮食，除公粮村款开支外，完全交信用社保存，贷放生息，在最近两年里，张国堂共存小麦一百二十斤，小米、绿豆二百七十斤，谷子八百九十一斤半。这样，即解决了农民当前的生产困难，又解决了将来张国堂复员后的成家立业问题。去年与今年的存粮，都是这样存的，共两个战士，一户烈属。新翻身的农民刘德玉说：“过去的地主放帐都得找有钱的当保人，现在的信用社都是给穷人办事，这二年要不是信用社贷给我粮食，地得荒了，人也得饿坏。”
    但检讨起来，该社也有缺点。一，期限太长太机械，每年都是春夏之间贷放，秋收后才还，没有作到随贷随收，川流不息，使存粮起更大作用。二、干部只管贷收，对贷粮户的生产组织与督促得不够。现该社正计划把这些存粮与村合作社的轧花机、风弓结合起来，作为扶助群众开展冬季纺织的基金。明春收回，再用到农业上去。（石理）
