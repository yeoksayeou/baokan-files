Criticism and Suggestions

　　Please Government Solve the Sales Problem of Gaocheng Homespun Cloth
　　Editor:
　　Gaocheng's sideline specialty is homespun cloth, but the sales problem has not been completely solved to this day, thus directly affecting the development of the textile industry. Especially this summer, the Hutuo River flooded the Mukedaogou area, inundating 137,383.196 mu of land (of which 52,956.624 mu were completely exempt from tax), resulting in a reduction of 1,514,659.28 shi dou in output. Therefore, turning the winter slack into winter busy, and vigorously developing textile production, has its special significance, so thoroughly solving the sales of homespun cloth has become the most urgent issue at present.
　　However, the main buyer of homespun cloth there is the county's Promotion Cooperative. Due to the lack of funds of the Promotion Cooperative, about 10,000 bolts of homespun cloth are brought to each market in Nanmeng, Nandong, Xiguan, and Xiaoguozhuang, but the Promotion Cooperative can only purchase 3,350 bolts (only accounting for one-third of the total homespun cloth in that market). The masses said, "We weave as wide as you tell us to weave, we weave as long as you tell us to weave, we weave as you lead us, but you can't not want it after we've woven it!"
　　Editor, I suggest that the government should quickly find a way to solve the sales problem of Gaocheng's homespun cloth, in order to promote the sale of mass-produced products and vigorously develop winter textile production.

### 请政府为藁城土布解决销路问题

　　请政府为藁城土布解决销路问题编辑同志：
    藁城的副业特产是土布，但销路问题直到现在仍未彻底解决，因此直接影响着纺织业的开展。尤其今夏滹沱河木道沟水泛被淹土地一三七三八三点一九六亩（内全部不收的即占五二九五六点六二四亩），共减收产量一五一四六五九·二八市斗，故将冬闲变冬忙，大量开展纺织，就更有他的特殊意义，所以彻底解决土布销路，也就更成为目前最迫切的问题。
    但在那里收买土布的主要是该县推进社，由于推进社资金缺乏，计南孟、南董、西关、小果庄每集共约上土布一万余匹，而推进社的力量只能收三三五○匹（只占该集土布总数的三分之一）。群众说：“叫织多宽就织多宽，叫织多长就织多长，怎么领导俺怎么织，但织出来不能不要了！”
    编辑同志，我建议政府应为藁城的土布销路问题急速想办法，以推销群众生产成品，大量开展冬季纺织。
