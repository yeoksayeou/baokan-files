　　Can Postal Remittances Be Used in Field Armies?
　　Question: Postal remittance services have begun to be implemented in local areas, which provides great convenience to the people. However, all personnel in the field armies cannot enjoy this convenience. I wonder what the reason is. Therefore, I propose that it is also necessary to implement postal remittances in the field armies. If this suggestion is implemented, there may not be many difficulties. Since I am not clear about it, please explain.

　　Answer: Last year, in order to serve the soldiers well, we tried to run remittance services in the military post office of the Liu-Deng Field Army. However, because the registered letters containing the remittance orders could not be directly delivered to the recipients, and we could not get the recipients' personally stamped receipts; and the unit mail dispatch often changed personnel quickly, or the mail registers were lost, making it impossible for the post office to track down; some even refused to stamp and return the receipts, leaving the post office with no evidence. Moreover, due to the high mobility of the troops, the transfer of remittance funds was extremely difficult, so we had to suspend the service.
　　Now, there are post offices everywhere in the North China Liberated Area, and almost all post offices can handle remittances. If the People's Liberation Army is fighting within this area, it can use ordinary postal remittances; if the troops move out of the area, even letters are difficult to guarantee regular contact, and if remittances are not received or cannot be cashed, it will not only fail to meet the soldiers' needs, but will also add a lot of trouble to them, which is more harmful than beneficial. Therefore, we have decided that military post offices will not handle registered mail and remittance services.

### 野战军中能否通汇？

　　野战军中能否通汇？
    问：关于邮局汇兑，地方上已开始实行，这样给人民以极大的便利。但是野战军一切人员，却不能享受这种便利条件，不知是什么原因。因此我提议，邮政汇兑在野战军中，也有实行的必要，这个意见执行起来，或没有很多的困难，因不明了，请予解释。　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　　　　　　　（之厚）
    答：去年我们为了很好的为兵服务，曾在刘邓野战兵团军邮局试办过汇兑，但因装汇票的挂号信，不能直接投交收件人手中，得不到收件人亲自盖章的回执；而部队收发，又往往因人事变更很快，或收发文簿丢失，以致邮局没法追查；甚至根本不给盖章，不退回执，使得邮局毫无凭据。又因部队流动性很大，汇兑款项调拨极感困难，因此不得不停办。
    现在华北解放区内，到处都有邮局，并且差不多的邮局都可以通汇。如果解放军在本区内作战，可以利用普邮汇款；如果部队打出去了，则虽信件亦难保证经常联系，而汇款收不到，或者兑不出，不但不能满足战士要求，反会增添他们许多麻烦，有损无益。因此，我们决定军邮不办挂号及汇兑业务。
