Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. The Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has issued an order to punish war criminals. The full text of the order is as follows:

Since our People's Liberation Army turned to the offensive, it has been invincible, and national victory is just around the corner. The Kuomintang reactionaries, facing the fate of annihilation, have recently become even more inhumane, using poison gas, slaughtering the people, destroying buildings, and destroying materials, engaging in dying, beastly destruction. Our entire army, from top to bottom, should not only work harder and take all effective measures to protect the lives and property of the country and the people, so that they will not be destroyed or lost when the Kuomintang army is defeated and annihilated, but also thoroughly investigate and severely punish such war criminals. To this end, in accordance with the spirit of our army's Double Tenth Declaration of 1947, the following orders are hereby announced:

I. All Kuomintang military officers and party and government officials at all levels who order their subordinates to carry out any of the following crimes, and for whom there is conclusive evidence, shall be arrested and charged as war criminals:

	1. Those who massacre the people, plunder the people's property, or demolish and burn the people's houses;
	2. Those who release poison gas;
	3. Those who kill prisoners;
	4. Those who destroy weapons and ammunition;
	5. Those who destroy communication equipment and burn all documents and files;
	6. Those who destroy food, clothing warehouses, and other military equipment;
	7. Those who destroy municipal water and electrical equipment, factory buildings, and various machines;
	8. Those who destroy sea, land, and air transportation vehicles and their equipment;
	9. Those who destroy bank vaults;
	10. Those who destroy cultural relics;
	11. Those who destroy all public materials and buildings;
	12. Those who carry out air raids and bombard liberated people's cities.

II. Anyone who takes the lead in carrying out any of the above-mentioned crimes shall also be punished according to law.

III. Anyone who takes effective measures to ensure the safety or prevent the destruction of the people's lives and property, and all war trophies and urban construction belonging to our army, shall be given due rewards.

The People's Liberation Army in all regions should earnestly implement this order.

Our army's policy towards Kuomintang reactionaries, party, government, and military personnel is: "The ringleaders must be punished, the coerced are not questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded." The above-mentioned war criminals belong to the category of ringleaders and must be pursued to the ends of the earth, so that they can be brought to justice and no one can escape the net. This is of utmost importance.

    我人民解放军自转入进攻以来，所向无敌，全国胜利，屈指可期，国民党反动派于覆没的命运，近更灭绝人性，施放毒气，屠杀人民，破坏建筑，毁灭物资，作垂死的兽性的破坏。我全军上下，除应更加努力，采取一切有效办法，保护国家与人民之生命财产，使之免遭国民党军队溃败被歼时之破坏与损失外，应对此种战争罪犯彻底追究，严予惩处。为此，特根据我军一九四七年双十节宣言之精神，宣布如下命令：
    一、凡国民党军官及其党部政府各级官吏，命令其部属，实行下列各项罪恶行为之一，而证据确凿者，均应加以逮捕，并以战犯论罪：
    １屠杀人民，抢掠人民财物或拆毁焚烧人民房屋者；
    ２施放毒气者；
    ３杀害俘虏者；

    我各地人民解放军应切实执行此项命令。
    我军对待国民党反动派党政军人员的政策是：“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖。”上述战争罪犯应属于首恶者一类，必须追寻他们至天涯海角，务使归案法办，不容漏网，切切此令。
