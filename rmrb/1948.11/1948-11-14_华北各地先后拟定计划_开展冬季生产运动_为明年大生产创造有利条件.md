　　North China: Various leading organs in North China have successively drafted winter production plans to lead the people of the entire region in a large-scale winter production effort. The Beiyue Administrative Office has decided that the guiding principle for winter production is primarily "to prepare sufficient capital and necessary conditions for next year's large-scale production." Wherever water conservancy can be developed, surveys and measurements should be planned, and funds and labor should be organized to begin work. Actively and effectively prepare all farm tools, organize the masses to manufacture and transport them, and provide strong assistance to cooperatives. Accumulate large amounts of fertilizer, mobilize the masses to collect manure, open oil presses and flour mills, and build toilets. At the same time, according to local customs, technology, raw materials, and sales conditions, organize idle labor to engage in various side occupations, focusing on industries that are broad in scope, high in demand, and profitable, and provide planned leadership and management. In terms of resource allocation, it is stipulated that organizations at all levels should assign one or two cadres to specifically lead winter production. Go deep into the masses, publicize policies, break down various ideological concerns, inspire enthusiasm for production, consolidate and establish cooperatives, and promote cooperation, mutual assistance, and joint operations. The Jizhong Administrative Office, in its instructions on winter production, pointed out: "The main task is to restore and develop rural side occupations and handicrafts." It requires localities to formulate restoration and development plans based on local production conditions and characteristics. It also calls on the masses to repair and add waterwheels and farm tools, and repair and dig wells in winter. Raise pigs in pens and accumulate large amounts of fertilizer. The Administrative Office especially encourages the transformation of agricultural mutual aid organizations, which have developed in this year's agricultural production, into cooperatives that operate side-line production in the winter. For those that have collapsed, do their best to support and help them consolidate. In actual implementation, production work should be integrated into various tasks. In the process of issuing land certificates, inspire the masses' enthusiasm for production and organize production. In party rectification, ensure that production is not delayed. In areas where land reform is underway, earnestly take into account the masses' production time. Commissioners and county heads should strengthen their leadership and control over production. The Ji-Lu-Yu region has also formulated a winter production plan, deciding to issue loans of 2.83 billion yuan and 3.05 million jin of wheat to assist the masses in production. The Fifth Special District of the Taihang region has decided to rely on cooperatives to organize various side occupations and household handicrafts, develop livestock; rely on village production committees to organize fertilizer accumulation, firewood gathering, and coal transportation to create favorable conditions for next year's large-scale production, and ensure that each person increases fine grain production by 20 jin next year. It also particularly emphasizes the party's centralized leadership, so that all departments and systems can be organically combined and act in unison. Pingding held a special financial and economic production meeting, determining that this winter should vigorously develop industry and mining. Publicly-owned stores should organize mass transportation and actively open up sales channels for coal and iron production. Zhengtang County (a new county, formerly Xinhe County) in southern Hebei suffered severe drought and insect plagues this year, resulting in a poor autumn harvest, estimated to be enough for only four months of consumption. The county government attaches great importance to this year's winter production. After precise calculations, it has decided to mobilize 36,000 female spinners to launch a 100-day spinning campaign, calling on each female spinner to weave three bolts of cloth, which can earn a total of 3.15 million jin of rice. It also mobilizes the masses to boil saltpeter, transport goods, open oil presses and flour mills, and earn a lot of money to get through the spring famine next year. Guangzong, Wei County, and other counties have also formulated similar plans.
