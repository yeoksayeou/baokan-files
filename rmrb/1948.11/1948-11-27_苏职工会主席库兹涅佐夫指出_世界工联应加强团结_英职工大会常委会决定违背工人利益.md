Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. TASS, Moscow, 13th: A reporter from Labor News presented the following question to Kuznetsov, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions: The British Trades Union Congress (TUC) General Council decided on October 27th to request the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) to discuss its proposal at the next meeting, namely that the WFTU should temporarily cease its activities, and indicated that if the WFTU refuses to cease its activities, the British TUC will withdraw from the WFTU. How do you evaluate this decision of the British TUC General Council?
Kuznetsov replied to this question: This proposal by the British TUC General Council is very wrong and harmful, both to the international trade union movement and to the British working class. Suspending the activities of the WFTU will only benefit those who are eager to split the unity of the international working class and weaken it, and will only benefit the likes of Churchill and imperialist aggression. The British TUC General Council's explanation of its motivation for taking this decision, namely the existence of differences within the WFTU, is unconvincing, and its motivation is clearly due to certain other considerations that the British trade union leaders are keeping silent about. The WFTU is a very important organization for the working class in its struggle to improve the living conditions of industrial workers and all working people, to fight for economic and social rights and freedoms, to oppose reactionaries, to oppose new war propaganda and preparations, and to strive for lasting and durable peace among nations. In the current situation, when the working people must wage a difficult struggle against the monopolistic capitalists' attacks on the living standards of the masses, it is necessary to strengthen the unity of international trade unions more than ever before and to carry out the activities of the WFTU. The WFTU must and will exist on the basis of the principles stipulated in its charter, because this is necessary for the interests of the working class throughout the world, and also for the interests of British workers. Kuznetsov finally declared: The Soviet trade unions are ready to continue to cooperate with all central trade union bodies, including the British TUC.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Telecommunications Agency, London: The British Communist Party Political Committee issued a statement on the 9th stating that the TUC General Council's attempt to undermine the WFTU and launch a new anti-communist movement is an excuse for the British government to implement a full-scale offensive against the living standards of workers. On October 27th, under the instigation of the Chairman of the General Council of the TUC, the trade union traitor Lawther, a reactionary resolution was passed demanding that the WFTU cease its activities, otherwise the British TUC would withdraw from the WFTU. The resolution shamelessly suggested the establishment of "a new international trade union organization" and launched slanderous attacks on the British Communist trade union leaders. According to a Telecommunications Agency report, Lawther's act of betrayal was carried out in accordance with Marshall's intentions. Marshall, at a banquet with Lawther not long ago, severely criticized the Labour government and the trade unions for supporting the Marshall Plan and the WFTU's refusal to serve American imperialism as "incompatible." Marshall demanded that the trade unions of the countries participating in the Marshall Plan, led by Britain, "eliminate the saboteurs and communists from their ranks." However, this resolution of the TUC General Council does not represent the feelings of the vast majority of British workers. When the Standing Committee voted on the proposal, there were thirty-three opponents. The Glasgow branch of the British Construction Workers' Union recently passed a resolution rejecting the TUC General Council's proposal to withdraw from the WFTU.

　　苏职工会主席库兹涅佐夫指出
  　世界工联应加强团结
    英职工大会常委会决定违背工人利益
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：劳动报记者向全苏职工会中央委员会主席库兹涅佐夫提出下列问题：英国职工大会常委会于十月二十七日决定，要求世界工联执行局下次会议讨论其所提建议，即世界工联应暂时停止活动，且指世界工联拒绝停止其活动，则英国职工会将退出世界工联。你对于英国职工大会常委会的这一决定如何评价？
    库兹涅佐夫对此问题答称：英国职工大会常委会的这个建议，不论对国际职工运动和英国工人阶级来说，都是非常错误与有害的。停止世界工联的活动，只会有利于那些亟欲分裂国际工人阶级团结并削弱工人阶级的人们，只会使邱吉尔之流及帝国主义的侵略取得利益。英国职工大会常委会说明其采取决定之动机，是由于世界工联内部存在分歧，这是不能令人信服的，其动机显然是由于英国工会领袖闭口不谈的某些其他考虑。世界工联是工人阶级在为增进产业工人及一切劳动人民生活条件，为争取经济社会权利及自由，反对反动派、反对新战争宣传及准备、争取各国间巩固持久和平而斗争的非常重要的组织。在目前情况下，当劳动人民必须进行艰苦斗争、反对独占资本家对人民大众生活水平的进攻时，必须较以往任何时候更加加强国际职工会的团结，开展世界工联的活动。世界工联必须而且将要在其章程规定之原则的基础上存在，因为这是全世界工人阶级的利益所必需的，也是英国工人的利益所必需的。库氏最后宣称：苏联职工会准备继续和一切职工会中央机构合作，包括英国职工大会在内。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】电通社伦敦讯：英共政治委员会于九日发表声明称：职工大会常委会之企图破坏世界工联及发动新的反共运动，乃是英政府准备对工人生活水准实行全面攻势的借口。按英国职工大会常委会十月二十七日在该委员会主席、工贼劳瑟的策动下，曾通过要求世界工联停止活动，否则英职工大会即将退出世界工联的反动决议。该决议无耻地建议成立“一个新的国际工会组织”，并对英共工会领袖实行诽谤攻击。据电通社报导，劳瑟这一背叛行动是奉行马歇尔的意旨的。马歇尔在不久前在与劳瑟的宴会上，曾严厉批评了党政府和职工会的支持马歇尔计划与世界工联之拒绝为美帝服务“不相和”。马氏要求以英国为首的参加马歇尔计划各国的职工会，“铲除他们队伍中的破坏分子及共产党人”。但职工大会常委会的这一决议，并不能代表英国广大劳工的情绪。常委会在表决该案时，反对者即有三十三人。英建筑工人工会格拉斯哥分会，最近亦通过决议，拒绝职工大会常委会退出世界工联的建议。
