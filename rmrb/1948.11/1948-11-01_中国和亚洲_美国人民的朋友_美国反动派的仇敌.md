    China and Asia
    ——Friends of the American People
    Enemies of the American Reactionaries
    Today we published a news item from Shanghai, reporting that American reactionaries are actively using various conspiracies to undermine the national democratic movements in China and Asia. We have already reported many facts about the oppression, aggression, and armed intervention of American imperialism against the Chinese and Asian people. The new things in this news are: Firstly, the American reactionaries admit that the people's revolutionary movements in China and Asia are supported by the broad masses of the people, and admit that the governments produced by the people's revolutionary movements are truly loyal to the people and extremely effective. Secondly, the American reactionaries regard the Chinese and Asian people obtaining their due and sacred rights as a "powerful and fatal threat" to the American reactionaries, thus proving how thoroughly the American government has torn up its promise in the Atlantic Charter of August 1941 to "respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live," thus proving how the American reactionaries are the mortal enemies of the Chinese and Asian people. Thirdly, the American reactionaries admit that the reactionary governments of China and various Asian countries are extremely corrupt, so that even with the vast military and economic assistance given by the United States to the Kuomintang government of China, it is impossible to prevent the victorious development of the people's revolutionary movements. Fourthly, due to the above situation, the American reactionaries believe that in order to save the demise of reactionary rule and the colonial system in China and various Asian countries, it is no longer possible to rely on open and "legal" methods, but must rely on secret, illegal methods, that is, the methods of the secret service. The American reactionaries have taken relying on the methods of Hitler and Himmler, relying on the methods of the Gestapo, and cooperating with the darkest forces in China, Japan, and various Asian countries, as a prescription for prolonging the life of imperialism.
    The foolishness of the American government's reactionary plan is obvious. Himmler did not prolong Hitler's rule, and problems that all military and economic aid cannot solve, secret service aid certainly cannot solve either. The strengthening of the activities of American secret service agencies in China and various Asian countries can only make the ruling groups in these countries fall into a desperate situation of losing popular support more quickly. Nevertheless, the Chinese people and the people of various Asian countries should draw important lessons from the American government's vicious plan. Since the American secret service plan focuses on provoking the left-wing camp, the left-wing camp should respond by consolidating its own unity. Since the American secret service plan focuses on buying off "middle-of-the-road parties" and developing "anti-communist" movements, those who fantasize about the middle road should abandon this fantasy, reject all "anti-communist" temptations, and beware of the danger of being captured by imperialist conspirators if they are not careful. When Chiang Kai-shek, the number one running dog of the United States in China, has been discredited and is useless, and the decision has been made to replace Chiang Kai-shek with the number two running dog, Li Zongren, some people in China who claim to be "middle-of-the-road" figures should examine their behavior to avoid being fooled by imperialism again. And the arrival of this opportunity is probably very imminent. Since the American secret service plan focuses on taking advantage of ethnic disputes, all oppressed nations, especially different ethnic groups in all multi-ethnic countries, should resolutely eliminate mutual prejudices and misunderstandings, abandon all kinds of narrow-minded nationalist erroneous ideas, to facilitate the common struggle against imperialism. Since the American secret service plan focuses on using traitors and spies, using espionage work, all revolutionary organizations should raise their vigilance, strengthen the anti-espionage struggle, and expose the ghosts and monsters to the light of day so that they cannot use their skills. There will still be difficulties on the road of the Chinese and Asian people's liberation movement. We must use the courage to break through thorns and thistles, and the prudence of walking on thin ice, to achieve our goals; but as long as we can do this, then we will definitely be able to achieve our goals.
    The American reactionaries in their plans regard the people of China and Asia as their enemies, and regard the liberation of the people of China and Asia as a "powerful and fatal threat" to themselves. This is because the American reactionaries vainly attempt to regard the people of China and Asia as their permanent colonial slaves. But the Chinese people and the Asian people are never enemies of the American people. The American reactionaries of the Truman or Dewey type have received and will continue to receive "irreparable and devastating blows" from the Chinese and Asian people; but the people's America, the America of Wallace and the Progressive Party, the America of the workers and the Communist Party, has gained and will continue to gain the friendship of the Chinese and Asian people. Whether the American reactionaries like it or not, the Chinese and Asian people will eventually gain liberation, and the running dogs of the American reactionaries in various countries and the American reactionaries themselves will eventually perish. All the conspiracies and tricks of the American imperialists are bound to turn into bubbles. Only the friendship between the people of China, various Asian countries, and the United States will last forever.

### 中国和亚洲——美国人民的朋友  美国反动派的仇敌

    中国和亚洲
    ——美国人民的朋友
    美国反动派的仇敌
    今天我们发表了上海来的一项消息，报告美国反动派正在积极以各种阴谋手段来破坏中国和亚洲的民族民主运动。美国帝国主义对中国人民和亚洲人民的种种压迫、侵略和武装干涉的事实，我们已经报导过很多。这个消息中间的新的东西，则是：第一、美国反动派承认中国和亚洲的人民革命运动是得到广大人民拥护的，承认在人民革命运动中所产生的政府，是真正忠实于人民和极有成效的政府。第二、美国反动派把中国和亚洲的人民获得他们应当获得的神圣权利，认为是对于美国反动派的“强有力的致命的威胁”，从而证明了美国政府如何彻底地撕毁了它在一九四一年八月大西洋宪章中所宣布的“尊重各民族自由选择其政府组织结构之自由”的诺言，从而证明了美国反动派如何是中国和亚洲人民的死敌。第三、美国反动派承认中国和亚洲各国反动政府是腐败已极，以至虽有象美国给予中国国民党政府这样浩大的军事和经济援助，也不可能阻止人民革命运动的胜利发展。第四、由于以上的情况，美国反动派认为：为了挽救中国和亚洲各国反动统治和殖民地制度的灭亡，现在已经不能依靠公开的“合法”的方法，而必须依靠不可告人的、非法的、即特务机关的方法。美国反动派已经把依靠希特勒和希姆莱的方法、依靠盖斯塔波的方法，与中国、日本和亚洲各国的最黑暗势力合作，作为延续帝国主义寿命的药方了。
    美国政府反动计划的愚蠢是显然的。希姆莱并没有延长希特勒的统治，一切军事援助和经济援助所不能解决的问题，特务援助也一定不能解决。美国特务机关活动在中国和亚洲各国的加强，只能使这些国家里的统治集团更加迅速地陷于众叛亲离的绝境。虽然如此，中国人民和亚洲各国人民应当从美国政府的凶恶计划中得到重要的教训。美国特务计划既然着重于挑拨左派阵营，那么左派阵营就应当以巩固自身的团结来答复它。美国特务计划既然着重于收买“中间性的政党”和发展“反共”运动，那么幻想中间路线的人们就应当抛弃这种幻想，就应当拒绝一切“反共”的引诱，提防自己一不小心就有被帝国主义阴谋家所俘虏的危险。当着美国在中国的第一名走狗蒋介石已经身败名裂、没有用处、从而决定以第二名走狗李宗仁去替换蒋介石的时候，中国有些自命为“中间性”人物的人们，就应当检点自己的行为，免上帝国主义的老当。而这种时机的到来大概已经很迫近了。美国特务计划既然着重于利用民族间的纠纷，那么一切被压迫民族之间，特别是一切多民族国家的不同民族之间，就应当坚决地消除相互间的成见和误会，抛弃各种各样狭隘民族主义的错误思想，以利反帝国主义的共同斗争。美国特务计划既然着重于利用叛徒和奸细，利用谍报工作，那么一切革命组织就应当提高警惕性，加强反间谍斗争，使鬼蜮之徒显露于光天化日之下而无所施其技。中国和亚洲人民解放运动的道路上还是会有困难的，我们必须用披荆斩棘的勇敢，临深履薄的谨慎，才能够达到目的；但是只要我们能够如此做到，那么我们就一定能够达到目的。
    美国反动派在他们的计划中把中国和亚洲的人民当做自己的仇敌，把中国和亚洲人民的解放看做是对于它自己的“强有力的致命的威胁”，这是因为美国反动派妄想把中国和亚洲人民当做自己的永久的殖民地奴隶的原故。但是中国人民和亚洲人民永远不是美国人民的敌人。杜鲁门或国威之流的美国反动派已经受到并将继续受到中杜和亚洲人民的“不可弥补的和毁灭性的打击”；但是人民的美国，华莱士和进步党的美国，劳动者和共产党的美国，却已经获得并将继续获得中国和亚洲人民的友谊。无论美国反动派愿意或不愿意，中国和亚洲人民终将获得解放，美国反动派在各国的走狗和美国反动派自己终将归于覆亡。美国帝国主义者的一切阴谋诡计都是一定要化为泡影的。只有中国、亚洲各国和美国的人民之间的友谊，将要永远存在。
