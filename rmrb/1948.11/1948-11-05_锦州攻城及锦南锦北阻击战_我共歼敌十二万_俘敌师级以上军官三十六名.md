Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 1st dispatch: The Northeast Field Army Headquarters issued its No. 1 War Communique, announcing the results of the Jinzhou Campaign. The communique stated:

　　The Northeast Field Army's Autumn Offensive began on September 12th. A portion of our army first launched a surprise long-distance raid on the Jin (zhou)-Tang (shan) section of the Beining Railway, encircling and cutting off the enemy along the line. After successively capturing Suizhong and Xingcheng, on October 1st, we captured Yixian, the northern barrier of Jinzhou, completely isolating the enemy in Jinzhou. From the 9th to the 13th, we cleared the outer defenses of Jinzhou City.

During this period, the enemy attempted to reinforce Jinzhou with two or three divisions and three cavalry brigades from the north and south.
