[Jilu-Yu Dispatch] The Jilu-Yu War Support Headquarters has successfully piloted relay transportation stations. In the past, the area relied on long-distance direct transportation, covering over 600 li (approximately 300 kilometers) round trip from the Yellow River to the Longhai Railway. This method had three serious drawbacks: First, due to the long distance, a large number of civilian laborers had to be gathered in advance and wait for assignments at the front, often wasting significant manpower and resources. For example, during the XX campaign, the excessive concentration of stretchers resulted in the consumption of an additional 1,798,791 jin (approximately 899 tons) of wheat and 2,098,589 jin (approximately 1049 tons) of firewood. This occurred during the busy autumn harvest season, causing incalculable delays in agricultural production. Second, the long journeys caused instability in the morale of civilian laborers, as it interfered with their agricultural production. Third, the concentration of large numbers of civilian laborers necessitated the prior accumulation of substantial amounts of grain and firewood, which also required significant manpower and financial resources.

　　In early September, when our army unit was cooperating with the Jinan Campaign, the War Support Headquarters, in order to minimize the use of civilian labor and reduce the impact on agricultural production, convened a joint meeting of all sub-headquarters to study and decide on adopting the "relay transportation station" method. A transportation station was established every 30 li (approximately 15 kilometers) from the front-line unit's dressing station to the rear hospital, and stretchers within a 15-li radius were organized to await dispatch. They were concentrated only when there was a task, and not otherwise. A system of voluntary contract work was implemented, with each stretcher team consisting of four people. After completing a 30-li transport, they would be given 15 jin (approximately 7.5 kilograms) of millet and a completion certificate, which would be recorded as work points.

　　To ensure timely control and avoid wasting civilian labor while enabling prompt assembly, close contact was established between the next station and the previous station. The next station would dispatch three people (one cadre and two messengers) to stay at the previous station to monitor the situation. Upon the arrival of wounded soldiers, they would immediately report the number of wounded and their arrival time to their own station. Upon receiving the notification, the station would promptly mobilize the required number of stretchers and concentrate them quickly. At the front line, wounded soldiers were carried by the army's regular stretchers to the front-line unit's dressing station for treatment and then immediately handed over to the relay station for transport.

　　During the Jinan Campaign, the adoption of this method overcame the various shortcomings of long-distance direct transportation. The civilian laborers were highly motivated and completed their tasks, saving a significant amount of manpower and financial resources, and achieving good results with half the effort. However, some areas experienced certain shortcomings due to the lack of specific research and detailed organizational work in advance. For example, the Huangduiji station experienced slow assembly because the district and villages had not established a good contact system in advance. Forty-nine stretchers were not fully assembled from the evening until the next morning. Juye County, on the other hand, did not implement this method at all, preparing only 600 regular stretchers for the entire county. In the event of a major battle, this would inevitably affect frontline support.

　　Therefore, in addition to deciding to universally implement the "relay transportation station" method throughout the area, the War Support Headquarters has also proposed the following improvement suggestions in response to the shortcomings revealed during implementation:

　　(1) Strengthen organization and unify command. The villages within a 15-li radius of the transportation station (30 li in diameter) will be uniformly used by the station. If it is located at the boundary between two districts, one county will be authorized by the sub-district to be responsible. If it is located at the boundary between two sub-districts, one county will be authorized by the general headquarters to be responsible. To take care of the physical strength of the civilian laborers, each stretcher team will be increased from four to five people.

　　(2) Strengthen communication and liaison: First, each station will concentrate 15 militiamen to specialize in communication work. Second, five to seven villages will be designated as a communication station, each with one or two liaisons responsible for conveying assignments and mobilizing civilian laborers, as well as inspecting the preparedness of the stretcher organization in each village. Third, the liaison personnel sent to the previous station should be aware of the situation at the station before that, in order to allow sufficient time for the station to mobilize stretchers. Fourth, depending on road conditions, liaison personnel can use bicycles or donkeys (vehicles can be borrowed from the government, and donkeys can be provided by the masses, with work points credited in lieu of payment).

　　(3) Stretchers should be used first from the outer circle (more than 5 li from the station), and those within 5 li should be used as a mobile force in case of urgent tasks.

　　(4) Regarding work points, the principle is one work point for every 30 li. If waiting for assignments or rainy weather delays the time by more than five days, work points will be added by the day.

　　(5) Regarding supplies: First, firewood equivalent to 1.4 meters of firewood will be distributed to civilian laborers for boiling water. Second, during the waiting period, the government will provide food according to the previous standards. Third, if the distance between two stations exceeds 30 li or involves detours, an additional 2.5 jin of rice will be issued for every 5 li exceeding the limit, with no additional rice for distances less than 5 li.

　　(6) Regarding the adjustment of civilian labor in areas more than 15 li from the transportation line and villages within 15 li of the station, the districts and counties must ensure a balanced burden. The methods are: First, areas more than 15 li away should provide more temporary stretchers (i.e., stretchers that are mobile at the first station), carrying poles, carts, and other rear-area services such as yellow river control, dike repair, and road construction. Second, the transportation station line should be based on one campaign as a standard. The station line should be changed for the next campaign. Over the long term, this will gradually move towards balance. Third, districts and villages near the river mouth and along the main road should provide as little of other services as possible, or not provide them at all, in order to specialize in undertaking relay transportation tasks. However, the leadership should manage this well to prevent significant disparities in the burden.

　　冀鲁豫克服长途转运支前缺点
  　试办接力转运成功
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫战勤总指挥部试办接力转运站成功。该区过去长途直线转运，从黄河边到陇海路往返六百多里。有三种严重缺点：一、因为距离太远，必须提前集中大批民工，在前方等候任务，往往浪费大批人力物力。如××战役时因集中担架太多，多吃麦子一七九八七九一斤，浪费柴二零九八五八九斤。当时正值群众收麦种秋，耽误生产更不可计算。二、长途跋涉，民工因耽误生产，情绪不稳。三、由于大批民工集中，事前必先集中大批粮柴，也需要花费大批人力财力。九月初，我军某部配合济南战役时，正值农忙，战勤总指挥部为了尽量节省民力，少误群众生产，特召开各分指联席会议；研究决定采用“接力转运站”办法。从前方部队包扎所到后方医院，每三十里设一个转运站，将周围十五里内之担架组织起来，听候调动。有任务时集中，无任务则不集中。实行义务包工制，每付担架定为四人，每运三十里完成任务后，发给小米十五斤，并发完工证，予以记工。为了准备掌握时间，不致浪费民工，又能及时集合，下站与上站取得密切联系。下站派三人（干部一、通讯员二）住上站听候情况，伤员到来后，马上将伤员数目、到达时间，迅速返报本站。本站接通知后，即按时按数调集担架迅速集中。在火线上，伤员由部队常备担架抬到前方部队包扎所换药后，立即交由转运站转运。这次配合济南战役中，采用这一办法，克服了长途直线转运中种种缺点，民工情绪很高，都完成了任务，并节省大批人力财力，收到了事半功倍的良好效果。但有些地区由于事先没有具体研究进行细密的组织工作，也发生了一些缺点。如黄堆集站因区与村事先没建立好联系制度，集合时很慢，四十九付担架从晚上到第二天早上还未完全集合起来。钜野则完全没按照这一办法去布置，全县只准备了六百付常备担架，遇有大的战役打响，势必影响支前。因此战勤总指挥部除决定将“接力转运站”办法在全区普遍实行外，又针对执行中暴露的缺点提出如下改进意见：（一）健全组织，统一指挥，转运站十五里路内之村庄（直径三十里），民工统一由该站使用。如系两区交界处，由分区授权一个县负责。两个分区交界，则由总指挥部授权一个县负责。为了照顾民工体力，每付担架由四人改为五人。（二）加强通信联络：一、每站集中民兵十五名，专任通信工作。二、五个至七个村庄划为一个通信站，各设联络员一、二人，专门负责传达任务，集中民工；并负责检查各村担架组织的准备工作。三、派往前站之联络人员，要掌握更前一站的情况，以争取本站调集担架时间的充足。四、根据道路情况，联络人员可乘自行车或毛驴（车子可向政府借用，毛驴用群众的，记工抵差）。（三）担架尽先用外圈的（离站五里地以外的），五里地以内者作为机动力量，以备任务紧迫时调用。（四）计工问题，原则上三十里一个工。因等候任务或阴雨拖延时间过五天以上者，按天增工。（五）供给问题：一、按一米四柴折发给民工柴火一部，以备烧水之用。二、等候任务时间，给养由政府按过去标准供给。三、两站之间超过三十里或绕道者，每满五里即增发米二斤半，不满五里者不增发。（六）转运线十五里以外地区与沿站十五里以内村庄民力之调剂问题，区县必须掌握负担平衡。办法是：一、十五里以外地区应多出临时担架（即机动在第一站上的担架）、挑担、大车以及其他后方差役如治黄修堤修路等。二、转运站线以一个战役为标准。下一战役即应改变站线。长期下去会逐渐走向平衡。三、靠近河口及沿大道的区村，其他差役尽量少出或不出，以备专门负担接力转运任务。但领导上应很好的掌握，以防负担上的悬殊不均现象。
