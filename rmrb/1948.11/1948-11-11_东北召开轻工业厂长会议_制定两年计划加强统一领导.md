Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 3rd: The Second Division (Light Industry Division) of the Northeast Political Affairs Committee's Industry Department convened a joint meeting of factory directors of its affiliated factories in September. Twenty units including paper mills, ceramics factories, chemical plants, cement plants, match factories, oil and wax factories, alcohol distilleries, and flour mills attended. In addition to generally summarizing work and exchanging experiences, the meeting, based on the needs of the new situation, determined future guidelines, formulated a two-year plan, and strengthened unified leadership. When summarizing the work, the meeting pointed out that over the past three years, from 1946 to the present, the restoration and construction of state-owned light industry in the Northeast has achieved considerable success. Two of the five paper mills have officially started operations, and both cement plants are actively undergoing restoration and construction. Among them, the Harbin Dongjian Cement Plant partially started operations in the first half of this year, producing over 10,000 tons of cement in five months. The output of other factories such as ceramics, alcohol, and oil and wax has also been substantial. The meeting also pointed out that in the past, these enterprises lacked unified and centralized leadership and the concept of long-term planning. Production lacked planning, and development lacked focus. Enterprises operated independently, disconnected from each other. Some even converted large machines into small machines, and machines that should not have been moved were moved, increasing the difficulty of restoration and repair. At the same time, state-owned light industry was not able to guide privately-owned counterparts onto a path of planned development. The meeting determined that the general guideline for the future is to develop the hardware and chemical industries, and to develop industries producing basic raw materials. Under this guideline, organized and planned production will be carried out, aiming to both repair and produce simultaneously. Existing constructions, regardless of the extent of damage, should be gradually restored. Those that cannot be restored immediately should be carefully guarded, and active investigation and research should be carried out, collecting manpower and materials, and making all preparations for restoration and repair. The production of each enterprise will first focus on the needs of the war, while also taking into account the needs of the people. In order to implement unified leadership, the meeting also decided to establish six enterprise companies for paper making, cement, chemicals, oil and wax chemicals, ceramics, and directly-affiliated enterprises, in order to unify the planning of manpower and materials and unify the production plans of each factory. On the issue of production funds, the principle of "factories supporting factories," "main supporting subsidiary," and "using existing to support those under construction" was determined. In addition, the meeting also held discussions on unified use and training of cadres, unified supply and marketing, wages, accounting, democratization of factory management, and enterprise management.
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 3rd: After two years of construction, the state-owned light and heavy industries in the Hejiang Province have reached a considerable scale. The province's main industries now include one coal mine, three gold mines, one machinery and iron factory and one farm tool factory each, and one shipping company, as well as flax, match, textile, oil extraction, and flour factories. The main industries operated by various counties include eleven textile and machinery iron factories. The province-owned coal mine has reserves of approximately 344 million tons, and the coal quality is excellent and can be used in heavy industry. The current daily output is 700 tons (or approximately 250,000 tons per year), and equipment is being improved and added, and more employees are being recruited. Next year's plan is to increase production to 400,000 tons. The machinery and iron factory is relatively well-equipped, and can manufacture general machine parts in addition to repairs. The shipping company has good development conditions due to the long waterways of the Songhua River, Ussuri River, and Heilongjiang River in the province, and has become one of the province's large-scale operating enterprises. In addition to continuing to expand existing industries next year, the province also plans to establish new industries such as fish canning and magnet manufacturing.

　　东北召开轻工业厂长会议
  　制定两年计划加强统一领导
    【新华社哈尔滨三日电】东北政委会工业部第二处（轻工业处）于九月间召开所属各厂厂长联席会议，到有造纸、陶瓷、化学、洋灰、火柴、油腊、酒精、面粉等二十个单位。会议除一般总结工作、交流经验外，并根据新形势的需要，确定了今后方针，制定了两年计划，并加强统一领导。会议于总结工作时指出：自一九四六年迄今，三年来，东北国营轻工业的恢复建设已获得相当成绩。五个造纸厂中已有两个厂正式开工，两个洋灰厂均在积极恢复建设。其中哈市东建洋灰厂于今年上半年部分开工后，五个月中产洋灰万余吨。其他如陶瓷、酒精、油腊等厂，产量亦大。会议并指出：过去这些企业没有统一集中的领导与长期打算的观念，生产缺乏计划性，生产发展没有重点；各企业间各自为政，相互脱节，有些甚至将大机器改成小机器，不该搬动的机器也搬动了，以致增加了恢复修建中的困难。同时，也没有使国营轻工业领导民营同业走上有计划的发展轨道。会议确定了今后总方针是发展五金工业和化学工业，发展基本原料的工业。在此方针下，进行有组织有计划的生产，要做到一面修建，一面生产。已有的建设不论破坏程度如何，都应逐步恢复。不能即时着手恢复者，应认真看守，并积极进行调查研究，搜集人力物力，作一切恢复修建的准备。各企业的生产，将首先注意战争的需要，同时照顾民需。为贯彻统一领导，会议又决定成立造纸、洋灰、化学、油腊化学、陶瓷、直属企业等六个企业公司，以统一筹划人力物力，统一各厂生产计划。在生产资金问题上，决定了“以厂养厂”，“以主养副”及“以现有的养正在建设的”之原则。此外，会议对统一使用培养干部、统一供销、工资、会计、工厂管理的民主化和企业化等问题，亦均展开讨论。
    【新华社哈尔滨三日电】合江省公营轻重工业，经两年建设，已具相当规模。现省营主要工业有煤矿一所，金矿三所，机械铁工厂与农具工厂各一所，并有轮船公司一所及亚麻、火柴、纺织、榨油、面粉等工厂。各县经营之主要工业有纺织、机械铁工厂共十一所。省营煤矿蕴藏量约达三亿四千余万吨，产煤质地甚佳，可供重工业应用。现日产七百吨（即年产约二十五万吨），并正改善增加设备，扩招员工。明年度计划增加产量至四十万吨，机械铁工厂设备相当完善，除修理外并能制造一般机件。轮船公司由于该省有松花江、乌苏里江、黑龙江等绵长之航线，故发展条件良好，已成为该省大规模经营的企业之一。明年该省除拟继续扩展已有工业外，并计划新设鱼罐头、制磁等工业。
