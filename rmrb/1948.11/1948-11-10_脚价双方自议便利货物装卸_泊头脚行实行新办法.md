　　Negotiated Freight Rates Between Labor and Capital Facilitate Cargo Loading and Unloading
  　Botou Porter Union Implements New Measures
    [Our Dispatch] In Botou City, Hebei Province, porter union workers are earnestly implementing policies beneficial to both labor and capital, and adopting a policy of negotiated freight rates and free loading and unloading. Before liberation, Botou's porter industry was divided into full-time porter unions and casual porter unions. Full-time porter unions had territorial divisions among themselves (each union occupied a certain area) and commodity divisions (such as coal being loaded and unloaded by one union, bamboo goods by another, goods from ships versus goods from trucks, etc.). Each porter union was controlled by feudal forces, often engaging in fights and brawls over territory and loading/unloading rights. If truck drivers loaded and unloaded themselves, they had to give the porter unions "truck-bottom money." Casual porter unions had no territory, and were only allowed to work when the full-time porter unions couldn't handle the work. The casual porter unions had to give the full-time unions "head money," or sometimes the full-time unions would hire the casual unions.

    After liberation, due to uneven recovery and development in various regions (e.g., no trains in Hedong, less work; more work in areas where state-owned stores were established), disputes frequently arose. The city's trade union had re-divided the territory, merged the casual porter unions, and established four porter unions, forming a general porter union (with a total of 316 workers). To take care of unions with less work, it was stipulated that in the future, in areas where state-owned enterprises were established, in addition to the porter union in that area handling the loading and unloading, other unions would also be drawn in to share the work. However, this led to too many foremen, mutual buck-passing, and no one taking responsibility. At the same time, due to more people than work, prices were arbitrarily raised, with different freight rates for public and private sectors, different rates for local and external businesses, and different rates for different trade unions and streets within the city. As a result, for sporadic jobs that the porter unions didn't handle in the past, the porter unions now demanded to load and unload, not allowing individuals to do it themselves, which inconvenienced local and external merchants and truck transport. In March of this year, the city trade union helped the porter unions and the chamber of commerce jointly agree on a porter charter, which specifically stipulated freight rate standards based on different goods, distance, weight, and number of items, and divided the territory. However, in practice, there were still many shortcomings. For example, distance divisions were inconsistent, different types of goods were treated differently, and truck drivers generally felt that the freight rates were too high and they were losing too much, which affected cargo transportation. At the same time, only allowing porter unions to load and unload, and not allowing free loading and unloading, made porter union workers less motivated to work actively, often leading to disputes with truck drivers and merchants, affecting cargo loading and unloading.

    After the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, the Hebei General Trade Union proposed that porter unions implement free loading and unloading. After discussion by the municipal party committee, it was considered suitable for Botou's situation, and it was decided to implement this policy, abolish the previously stipulated freight rates and unified porterage: implement free loading and unloading, and free pricing, to facilitate merchants and people, and achieve a labor-capital win-win policy. In early August, the municipal party committee invited the heads of the municipal government, the municipal trade union, and various state-owned enterprise departments to jointly study the issue of free loading and unloading by porter unions. Everyone unanimously agreed with this. However, some raised the question of whether freight rates could be standardized according to distance and weight. Was it too troublesome to negotiate a price each time they carried something? Some said: "It's no problem if there's less cargo, but what if there's too much cargo and the workers won't carry it? After free loading and unloading, if the porter union's work is reduced, can the government provide loans to help workers engage in other production?" After discussing these issues, it was generally believed that the implementation of free loading and unloading would naturally form a standard price, which didn't need to be stipulated. If there was too much cargo, the porter union wouldn't refuse to carry it, because the porter union still had to attract customers. If this one didn't carry it, they could hire another one. As for the possibility that the porter union's work might be reduced, it wouldn't be too different, and merchants couldn't carry large quantities of goods. If there were too many people in the porter union and not enough work, some could become casual porters. If disputes arose between porter unions over loading and unloading, the cargo owner had the right to decide who would carry it, which could also be resolved. Finally, everyone proposed to prevent retaliation against the porter union (such as deliberately lowering freight rates), affecting the porter union's livelihood and creating antagonism. On August 7th, the municipal trade union convened a city-wide porter union worker meeting, announced and explained the significance and benefits of the free loading and unloading policy, and called on Communist Party members to respond to the party's call and become models of abiding by laws and regulations.

    After the free loading and unloading policy was announced, confusion arose in the workers' minds for a while. Many reflected: "It's all over now," "If the casual porters also unload, watch out for fights!" Some said: "The higher-level resolution says to do whatever they say." Some said: "If you don't put in labor, you can't make a living, and the old and young will have to be laid off," "It's the same as before, whoever gets the job is theirs, and we have to work hard in the future to create a brand," "If you don't do it, someone else will, and there will be conflicts in the porter union." Others said: "We still have to follow the old path, and not encroach on other people's work." A few said: "It's okay for truck drivers to load and unload freely, but not for merchants." Based on these thoughts, the municipal party committee conducted research and specific explanations with the branch committees of each porter union. Then each porter union held a party member meeting to explain and mobilize. Finally, on August 13th, the municipal government officially issued a public notice for implementation.

    After implementation, the relationship between the porter unions and the merchants and truck drivers improved. Some porter unions dispersed their personnel to the entrances of various businesses on the street, competing to carry; the second and third porter unions automatically convened a meeting of businesses in their area to unite and attract customers, proposing to guarantee good service in the future. The businesses also conducted self-criticism, and both sides were harmonious. The previously stipulated price of 1,500 yuan (per 100 catties) is now freely negotiated to 2,600 yuan, and both parties have no objections. The third porter union automatically lowered the price of loading oil for Gongyi Cheng by 1,000 yuan per barrel. The porter union was initially afraid it wouldn't work, but after a few days of experimentation, it felt it was similar to the past. Now there are fewer complaints. Merchants generally say this is reasonable and convenient.

    There are still several problems that have not been resolved: (1) Full-time porter unions still have the idea of fearing competition from casual porter unions. (2) The current territory and organization have not changed. In the future, when business development is uneven, there may still be disputes between porter unions with more work and those with less. (3) It is currently the slack season, and there are many porters and little work, and their lives will be affected if this continues.

### 脚价双方自议便利货物装卸　泊头脚行实行新办法

　　脚价双方自议便利货物装卸
  　泊头脚行实行新办法
    【本报讯】冀中泊头市脚行工人，认真贯彻劳资两利政策，实行脚价自议装卸自由方针。泊头未解放前，脚行分为整脚行与散脚行两种。整脚行相互之间有地盘的划分（一个脚行占一片），有货物种类的划分（如煤炭归那脚行装卸，竹货归那脚行装卸，船上来的与大车上来的等）。各脚行都受封建势力操纵，时常为争地盘争装卸打架斗殴，大车上自己装卸，得给脚行“车底钱”。散脚行无地盘，整脚行扛不过来的活才允许散脚行扛，散脚行得给整脚行“头钱”，也有时活多了整脚行雇散脚行的。
    解放后由于各区域恢复与发展不平衡（如河东没了火车，活少了，公营商店建立的地区活多了）经常发生争执。该市工会曾重新划分了地盘，连散脚行合并，成立四个脚行工会，建立脚行总工会（共有工人三百十六人）。为了照顾活少的脚行，规定今后凡公营企业建立的地方，除该地区脚行装卸外，并抽别的脚行共同扛脚。但又发生头目多，互相推托，没人负责的现象。同时由于人多活少，随便长价，公私脚价不同，本市与外来的不同，本市各工会各街也不同，因此对零星的活过去脚行不管的，现在脚行也要装卸，不准本人自己装卸，以致影响本市及外来商人及大车运输均感不便。今年三月市工会帮助脚行和商会共同议定一个脚行章则，按不同货物，按远近分段，按斤按件，具体规定脚价标准，并划分地盘。但执行起来，仍有不少缺点。如划段远近不能一致，货物种类不同，一般大车感觉脚价太重，吃亏太大，影响货物运输。同时只准脚行装卸，不准自由装卸，脚行工人就不积极扛，时常与大车和商人发生争执，影响货物装卸。
    华北工商业会议后，冀中总工会提出脚行实行自由装卸，经市委讨论，认为适合泊头情况，决定贯彻这一方针，取消过去规定脚价，统制扛脚：实行自由装卸，自由议价，以便利商民，实现劳资两利政策。八月初，市委邀请了市政府、市工会及各公营企业部门负责人共同研究脚行自由装卸问题，大家对此都一致同意。但有的提出脚价是否可根据远近轻重规定标准？扛一次一说价是否太麻烦？有人说：货少了没问题，货多了工人不扛怎么办？自由装卸后，脚行可能活少，政府可否贷款帮助工人干别的生产？这些问题经过讨论，一般认为实行自由装卸，自然会形成一个标准价，无须规定。货多了脚行也不会不扛，因为脚行还要拉主顾，这个不扛还可雇另一个。至于脚行活可能少些，但不会相差太多，大宗货物商人扛不了。如脚行人多活少，有的可以变成散脚行。如脚行与脚行之间发生争装争卸，叫谁扛货主有决定权，也可解决。最后大家提出要防止对脚行报复（如故意压低脚价），影响脚行生活，造成互相对立。八月七日市工会召开全市脚行工人大会，宣布与解释了自由装卸方针的意义与好处，并号召共产党员响应党的号召，成为遵守法令的模范。
    自由装卸方针宣布后，工人在思想上曾一时发生混乱。不少的反映：“这一下就完了”，“散脚行也卸，看打架吧！”有的说：“上级决议，叫怎么着就怎么着办呗”。有的说：“今后不出劳动力吃不开了，老的小的得裁下去”，“和过去一样了，谁揽了活是谁的，今后得好好干，创牌子”，“你干不着人家就干，脚行得闹矛盾”。还有的说：“还得按老道走，不侵人家的活”。有个别的说：“大车自由装卸还可以，商人就不行”。市委根据这些思想，和各脚行支委进行了研究和具体的解释。然后各脚行召开党员大会，进行解释与动员。最后于八月十三日由市政府正式布告实行。
    实行后，脚行与商人大车的关系改善了。有的脚行把人都分散到街上各商号门口，抢着扛；二、三脚行自动的召集所在地区商号开了个会，进行团结拉主顾，提出保证以后好好扛，商号也作了检讨，双方都和睦了。过去规定一千五百元（百斤），现在自由议价为两千六百元，双方无意见。三脚行给公益成装油，每桶自动落了一千元，脚行开始怕不行，经过几天试验，觉得和过去差不多。现在说怪话的也少了。商人一般都说这样合理便利。
    现在还有几个问题没有得到解决：（一）整脚行怕散脚行和他们竞争的思想还存在。（二）现在地盘与组织未变动，在今后买卖发展不平衡时，有的活多有的活少，脚行之间还可能发生争执。（三）现在正是背月，脚行人多活少，继续下去生活要受影响。
