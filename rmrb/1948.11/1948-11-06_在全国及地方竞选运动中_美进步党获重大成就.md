Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 4th: TASS, New York, November 1st: Besides winning the major victory of being listed on the election ballots in 45 states, enabling Wallace and Taylor to become national candidates, the Progressive Party has also conducted a vigorous local election campaign. It is campaigning for 114 members of the House of Representatives, 11 senators, 12 governors, and hundreds of state legislators and judges. In addition, Progressive Party members are officially supporting 14 Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives.

　　In some instances, reactionary authorities have, at the last minute, used court decisions or other methods to remove local Progressive Party candidates from the election lists. This has occurred in Georgia, Illinois, West Virginia, and Wyoming. In other cases, in areas where the Progressive forces are strong, reactionary forces have united to support a single reactionary candidate, as is the case in some districts of New York State. There, a coalition of Republican, Democratic, and Liberal parties (note that the Liberal Party exists only in New York State, and its leader is the notorious labor traitor Dubinsky) has formed. A similar situation exists in California and Illinois, where an informal two-party "secret agreement" has been created.

　　Despite these obstacles, Progressive Party members still believe they can elect some House of Representatives candidates in states like New York, California, Illinois, and Washington. The Progressive Party is only putting forward candidates in 25 states, with New York, California, and Illinois being of major significance. In New York State, the American Labor Party has recommended 45 House of Representatives candidates, including eight Democrats approved by the American Labor Party (including Celler, Klein, the black man Powell, and Paul, the brother of New York City Mayor O'Dwyer).

　　It is reported that the Republican Party is spending a large amount of money on the election campaign. Most of it is being used for anti-communist smears. In this regard, they are supported by all newspapers in New York City except for the Worker's Daily. The New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune have repeatedly called in editorials for the defeat of Marcantonio (note that he is a Labor Party member of the House of Representatives) as one of the main achievements of the current election campaign.

　　Meanwhile, Chicago Progressives are intensifying their campaign for four House of Representatives candidates. Among the four candidates is the prominent black lawyer Dixon. Mr. Dixon was once associated with Roosevelt's "Fair Employment Committee" and is now involved in the defense of Communist Party General Secretary Dennis. Although the court decided to remove Progressive Party candidates from the election lists throughout Illinois, the Progressive Party still retains the right to nominate local candidates in Cook County, including the city of Chicago. In California, the Progressive Party is campaigning for thirteen House of Representatives candidates. In a speech in Philadelphia, Wallace summarized the achievements of the election campaign, declaring that the greatest achievement was the creation in ten months of "a people's party that arose from our own needs and with our own strength."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 4th: TASS, New York: New York citizens warmly welcomed the Progressive Party presidential candidate Wallace's election campaign. When Wallace delivered speeches at several rallies in the working-class district of Brooklyn on October 31st, the audience numbered at least 100,000. On that day, he paraded through the district in an open car, followed by 50 cars plastered with Progressive Party slogans and flags. According to police estimates, this parade was cheered by at least 500,000 people. 30,000 workers from the New York City Furriers Union participated in an outdoor demonstration in support of Wallace. American newspapers pointed out that the warm reception Wallace received was in stark contrast to the cold shoulder Truman received during his campaign in New York. In his speech, Wallace condemned the two major parties for not mentioning the issues of peace and prosperity in their campaigns, while they "know that the real point of contention is: will we get peace or go to war. The bipartisan foreign policy has sunk billions of dollars into China and Greece and is driving us towards war." In his speech to the fur workers, he said that he had received a personal letter from Markos, the leader of the Greek Democratic Army, asking him to help stop the bloodshed in Greece. Wallace declared that Markos's letter represented "the best democratic traditions." At the same time, Progressive Party vice-presidential candidate Taylor has delivered his final speech in Denver, condemning Wall Street and the military for deliberately creating tension in the world today. He said: "Those who are brewing war fever are the very people who actively helped Hitler come to power. We will not get peace unless the American people reject the architects of these foreign policies."

　　在全国及地方竞选运动中
  　美进步党获重大成就
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社纽约一日讯：进步党除了在四十五州赢得列名于选举名单使华莱士和泰勒成为全国候选人而获得重大胜利外，同时亦进行了蓬勃的地方竞选运动。它正为一一四名众议员、十一名参议员、十二名州长和数百名州议员及法官等竞选。此外，进步党党员又正式支持民主党十四名众议员候选人。
    在某些场合，反动当局在最后一分钟，以由法庭决议或其他手法，从选举名单上勾销了当地的进步党候选人。乔治亚、伊利诺斯、西弗吉尼亚、怀俄明各州，都发生过这种情形。在另外的场合，在进步势力强大的地方，反动势力联合起来支持单一的反动的候选人，这是纽约州某些区的情形。在那里，形成了共和、民主和自由党（按自由党仅存于纽约州，其党魁为著名工贼杜宾斯基）的联合。加利福尼亚和伊利诺斯州也有这种情形，那里缔造了非正式的两党“密约”。
    尽管有这些阻碍，进步党党员仍然相信他们可以在纽约、加利福尼亚、伊利诺斯和华盛顿等州选上某些众议员候选人。进步党只在二十五州提出候选人，其中纽约、加利福尼亚、伊利诺斯具有重大意义。在纽约州，美国劳工党推荐了四十五名众议员候选人，其中有美国劳工党所批准的八个民主党人（包括塞勒、克林，黑人鲍威尔，及纽约市长奥德威的兄弟鲍尔）。
    据悉，共和党正为竞选运动花费大量金钱。大部分都用于反共污蔑。在这方面，他们得到除工人日报以外纽约市所有报纸的支持，纽约时报和纽约先驱论坛报在社论中再三要求击败马肯托尼奥（按系劳工党众议员）作为目前选举运动的主要成就之一。
    同时，芝加哥进步党员正加紧进行四名众议员候选人的竞选运动。四名候选人中有著名的黑人律师狄克逊。狄氏曾一度与罗斯福的“公平就业委员会”有关，现在则参与共产党总书记但尼斯的辩护。尽管法庭决定自伊利诺斯全州的选举名单上勾销进步党候选人，但是进步党仍保持有在包括芝加哥市在内的科克县提出地方候选人的权利。在加利福尼亚，进步党正为十三个众议员候选人竞选。华莱士在费城演说中总结选举运动的成就时宣称，最伟大的成就在于在十个月的时间内创建了“由于我们自己的需要和用我们自己的力量而产生的人民的政党”。
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社纽约讯：纽约市民热烈欢迎进步党总统候选人华莱士的竞选运动。当华氏十月三十一日在布鲁克林工人区数处集会上发表演说时，听讲者最少达十万人。是日，他曾乘敞车在该区游行，后面尾随着满贴拥护进步党标语和旗帜的汽车五十辆。据警方估计，这一游行至少受到五十万群众的欢呼。纽约市毛皮工会工人三万人曾参加户外拥护华莱士的示威游行。美国报纸指出：华莱士所受到的热烈接待与杜鲁门在纽约竞选时所受到的冷遇，适成鲜明的对照。华氏在演说中谴责两大党在竞选中不提和平与繁荣问题，而它们是“知道真正的争执点是：我们将得到和平抑或进入战争。两党一致的外交政策已将成十亿计的美元沉入中国和希腊，并将我们驱向战争”。他在向毛皮工人演说时，说他接到了希民主军领袖马科斯的亲笔信，信中要求他帮助停止希腊的流血。华氏宣称：马科斯的信是代表“最优良的民主传统”。同时，进步党副总统候选人泰勒已在丹佛发表其最后一次演说，谴责华尔街和军人蓄意制造今日世界上的紧张。他说：“酝酿战争狂的人正是那些曾积极帮助希特勒上台的人。美国人民不唾弃这些外交政策的制订人，我们就得不到和平。”
