　　Shijiazhuang Production Promotion Agency Holds Meeting to Study
  　Organization of Mass Production Cooperation
    [Shijiazhuang News] The Shijiazhuang Production Promotion Agency convened a meeting of district agency directors and women cadres to review the current mass production and cooperation efforts. Currently, mass production is relatively sluggish. Although sewing work will increase for women as winter approaches, some cotton weaving factories have reduced production, and the production of cotton military uniforms is also nearing completion. Women who wind thread are temporarily out of work, and another 1,500 to 1,600 women are seeking employment. Everyone exchanged information on the actual situation and examined the shortcomings of not organizing various small producers in the past. They proposed a policy of combining with district and street governments to organize production and marketing cooperatives, going deep into the masses, specifically organizing voluntary production and marketing that combines with market needs, and solving the production and living problems of scattered, semi-unemployed small producers and the poor. The following items can be organized currently: 1. Vigorously and specifically assist the existing five shoe-making cooperatives and nine public shoe factories, and organize new shoe-making worker cooperatives, focusing on contracting for military shoes, mobilizing some women to participate in shoe-making, making cardboard inserts, twisting hemp rope, learning to sew soles, poor people peddling rags, and introducing weaving cooperatives and dyeing houses to contract for weaving and dyeing shoe cloth, solving the sales problem of cloth and the dyeing house problem. There are now fourteen cooperatives and shoe factories, newly contracting for 80,000 pairs of military shoes, requiring a total of over 980 bolts of wide cloth, over 8,000 catties of rags, over 20,000 catties of hemp rope, and over 16,000 sheets of cardboard. Tongfeng Weaving Cooperative and the shoe factory in the Second Street of the Fourth District have agreed on contracting for cloth. Minsheng and Limin Weaving Cooperatives have placed orders with the Mass Production Cooperative (shoe factory) in the Second Street of the First District. Liumin and Gongyi Weaving Cooperatives have signed contracts with the shoe-making cooperative in the 33rd Street of the First District. The shoe factories are planning to discuss dyeing cloth, spinning hemp rope, buying rags, and sewing soles at the end of the month. 2. The Promotion Agency has newly contracted for tens of thousands of catties of backpack rope, and will organize hemp-spinning worker cooperatives to spin hemp rope and women to spin thread rope. 3. Organize women who are willing and able to spin thread to spin thread for the Municipal Agency. The business will be managed by the Municipal Agency's Supply and Marketing Department, and the organization and introduction will be the responsibility of the District Agencies. 4. The Municipal Agency's Supply and Marketing Department is planning to purchase goods that poor peddlers can transport, sell, and supply at low prices, and organize transportation and sales teams according to the situation and the voluntary participation of the masses.
    At the meeting, each district put forward its preliminary plan and has now begun to take action.
