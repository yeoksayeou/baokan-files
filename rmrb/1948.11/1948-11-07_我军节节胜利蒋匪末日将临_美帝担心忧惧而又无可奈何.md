　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. "The Northeast has become a canceled issue, can North China be defended now? ... Can the government forces defend any line of defense, including the Yangtze River, and the fertile land south of it, including Nanjing, Shanghai and other places?" This series of frustrating questions raised in a report by the Associated Press reporter portrays how American imperialist elements are panicked in the face of the successive victories of our People's Liberation Army; how worried, fearful, and helpless they are about the approaching end of the anti-people's criminal rule of their lackey Chiang Kai-shek. Agence France-Presse's Washington dispatch on the 1st stated: "The capture of Shenyang and the victory of the Communists in other parts of Manchuria have caused serious panic among all political figures here." The American press admitted that this was "a major failure of the Truman Doctrine (i.e., American expansionism) that occurred right before the US presidential election." (Electric News Agency, New York, 1st) Dewey, who has always shouted "strengthening aid to China" as his own campaign political capital, had to remain silent and dared not "comment" (according to the Central News Agency, New York, 1st). The so-called American "Senior Expert on China Issues in the Army Department," Wedemeyer, is also "reviewing the situation of Chiang Kai-shek's army with naval officers." (United Press Agency, Washington, 1st)
　　Now, Chiang Kai-shek's American masters are worrying about the fate of the Kuomintang in North China, Central China, and even South China. The Scripps-Howard newspaper lamented: "Since the government's last few outposts in Manchuria surrendered to the Chinese Communists, it is expected that the cities of North China, such as Tianjin, Qingdao, etc., will be directly attacked by the Communists in the near future." The Associated Press stated: "If the troops are surrendering to the enemy without a fight (referring to the defection and surrender of the Kuomintang army to the People's Liberation Army) as the Kuomintang people ominously imply, then everything from Shenyang to the Yangtze River, and even further south, is finished." Regarding the situation in Central China that Kuomintang officials in Nanjing talk about every day, according to the Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing: "Foreign observers believe that the subordinates of the Central China Command are not even as good as the Northeast Kuomintang army that was defeated by Lin Biao's Manchurian troops."
　　According to news from the United States, American imperialism is attempting to "save" its Chinese lackeys and is planning to rush the shipment of 125 million US dollars worth of military aid to Chiang Kai-shek. The first batch of military supplies, originally scheduled to be shipped in December, will be transported by army and navy ships for fear of being affected by the recent strike by longshoremen on the west coast of the United States. Reuters also reported that under American pressure, "Chiang Kai-shek has personally agreed that all future military assistance will be directly transported by the US Navy to North China, specifically for Fu Zuoyi's combat troops." But at the same time, American imperialists with two or three years of experience in assisting Chiang Kai-shek are worried that "any American military aid will be useless to Nanjing's cause, because the Communists seize these weapons from the corrupt Kuomintang army." (Agence France-Presse quoted opinions from diplomatic circles in Washington). The recent victory of the People's Liberation Army in the Northeast most powerfully illustrates this point. Even an Associated Press reporter admitted: "The complete victory of the Communists in Manchuria has caused Chiang Kai-shek to lose almost all of the thirty-nine Chinese divisions trained and equipped by the United States." "And this may cause Chiang Kai-shek to lose more weapons and ammunition than the entire 125 million US dollars in military aid can buy." Therefore, it is understandable that the New York Herald Tribune sadly stated the sorrow of American imperialism, saying: The United States must rescue Chiang Kai-shek, "but it faces an unchangeable fact, that is, the strength and financial resources of the United States are not unlimited." And it said: "Even if the United States had ten times the strength it actually has, it would not be able to save the Kuomintang regime."

　　我军节节胜利蒋匪末日将临
  　美帝担心忧惧而又无可奈何
    【新华社陕北五日电】“东北已成为勾销了的问题，华北现在能够守住吗？…政府军能够守住甚至包括长江在内的任何防线和京沪及其他南方的沃土防线吗？”这一美联社记者报导中所提出的一连串沮丧的问题，刻划出美帝国主义分子在我人民解放军节节胜利面前，是如何惊慌失措；他们对于其走狗蒋介石的反人民罪恶统治之末日行将降临，是如何担心、忧惧而又无可奈何。法新社华盛顿一日电称：“沈阳的攻占及共产党在满洲其他地方的胜利已在此间所有政界人士中引起严重的惊慌。”美国报界承认这是“恰在美国总统选举前夕发生的杜鲁门主义（即美对外扩张主义）的一个大失败。”（电通社纽约一日电）一向以高叫“加强援华”作为自己竞选政治资本的杜威对此也只好哑然无言，不敢“置评”（据中央社纽约一日电）。所谓美国“陆军部中国问题高级专家”魏德迈也“正在与海军官员检讨蒋介石军队的势景”。（合众社华盛顿一日电）
    现在，蒋贼的美国主子正在担心着国民党在华北、华中以至华南的命运。斯克里浦期·霍华德系报纸悲鸣：“由于政府在满洲最后几个前哨向中共投降，预料平津青岛等华北城市的遭到共产党直接攻击已是指日可待的问题了。”美联社则称：“如果军队正在不战而投敌（指国民党军向人民解放军反正及投降）有如国民党人士所不祥地暗示的一样，那末，由沈阳直到长江，甚至更南一些，就一切都完了。”对于南京国民党官员每天谈论着的华中战局，据美联社南京电透露：“外国观察家认为华中指挥部的部下甚至还不如那些在林彪的满洲部队攻击下被打垮的东北国民党军”。
    据美国方面消息，美帝国主义妄图“拯救”其中国走狗，正拟急忙提前赶运一亿二千五百万元的军事援蒋物资。原定于十二月间启运的首批军用品，因为怕受最近美国西海岸码头工人罢工的影响，将由陆海军船只载运。路透社消息并称：在美国压力下“蒋介石已亲自同意，将来一切军事援助将由美海军直接运往华北，专供傅作义作战部队之用。”但是在这同时，有两三年援蒋经验的美帝国主义者却担心着“美国的任何军备援助都对南京的事业有害无益，因为共产党把这些武器从败坏了的国民党军队手中夺取去了。”（法新社引华盛顿外交界人士意见）。最近人民解放军在东北的胜利，最有力地说明了这点，甚至美联社记者也承认：“共产党在满洲的全胜，使蒋介石损失了美国训练和装备的三十九个中国师的几乎全部。”“而且这也许会使蒋介石所损失的武器和弹药，较之整个一亿二千五百万美元军事援助赠予所能购买到的还要多。”所以纽约先驱论坛报很伤心地道出了美帝国主义的悲哀是很可以理解的，它说：美国必须援救蒋介石，“但是却面对着一个无可更改的事实，即美国的力量和财源并不是没有限度的。”并且说：“即令美国有十倍于实际所有的力量，也无法挽救国民党政权”。
