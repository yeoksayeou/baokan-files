Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 10th. Simultaneously with the brilliant military victories of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, the farmers of Songjiang Province have also achieved a major victory on the agricultural production front, exceeding this year's production increase plan by two and a half times. A bumper harvest has been universally reported in the autumn fields of all seventeen counties in the province. Based solely on the statistics of the province's original twelve counties (excluding the areas incorporated from Mudanjiang and Jilin provinces), grain production has increased by more than 1.73 million shi compared to last year, which is more than three and a half times the original production increase plan of 470,000 shi for this year. Last year, the original cultivated land area of the twelve counties, excluding more than 80,000 qing of wheat fields, was more than 980,000 qing (1 qing = 10 mu), with an average yield of only 3 shi and 8 dou per qing, and a total output of more than 3.74 million shi. As a result of large-scale land reclamation and the expansion of paddy fields last year, the cultivated land area has increased by more than 40,000 qing this year, totaling more than 1.02 million qing. The average yield per qing has increased by 1 shi and 5 dou and 3 sheng compared to last year, reaching 5 shi, 3 dou, and 3 sheng. The total grain harvest is more than 5.46 million shi. This year, the total cultivated land area of the seventeen counties in Songjiang Province is more than 1.32 million qing, and the total harvest is expected to reach more than 6.54 million shi.

　　松江农业增产重大胜利
  　超过今年计划达两倍半
    【新华社哈尔滨十日电】与东北人民解放军辉煌的军事胜利同时，松江省农民在农业生产战线上也获得了超过今年增产计划两倍半的重大胜利。全省十七县秋田普告丰收。单以该省原有十二县统计（即不计算由牡丹江与吉林两省划入之面积在内），即较去年增产粮食一百七十三万余石，等于原订今年增产计划四十七万石的三倍半强。去年十二县原耕地面积除麦地八万余垧外，为九十八万余垧（每垧十亩），平均产量仅为三石八斗，总产量为三百七十四万余石。经过去年大量开荒、增辟水田的结果，今年耕地面积扩大了四万余垧，共为一百零二万余垧。每垧平均产量比去年增加一石五斗三升，即达五石三斗三升。共可收粮食五百四十六万余石。今年松江全省十七县总耕地面积为一百三十二万余垧，总收获量可达六百五十四万余石。
