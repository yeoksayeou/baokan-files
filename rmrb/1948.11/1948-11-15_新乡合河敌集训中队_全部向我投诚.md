[Taihang Telegram] The enemy garrison at the Hehe stronghold, more than 20 li west of Xinxiang, the Hehe Township Training Squadron, defected to us in full under the leadership of Squadron Leader Li Dingwen. Due to our army's liberation of Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and a series of major victories on the western end of the Daoqing Railway, the squadron began to waver. At that time, Li's unit even dreamed of escaping to Huojia City, which was temporarily occupied by the Kuomintang army, but the Chiang bandits stationed in the city refused to allow them to enter the city, instead forcing them to serve as cannon fodder outside the city. The facts clearly told Li's unit that following the Kuomintang reactionaries, their ultimate fate was nothing more than dying in vain for the Kuomintang reactionaries or being abandoned by the reactionaries. The rapidly advancing People's Liberation Army liberated Huojia City on the 2nd of this month. The Chiang bandits in northern Henan were completely trapped in a desperate situation with "no way to go to heaven and no way to enter the earth." On the morning of the 3rd, Hehe Township Training Squadron Leader Li Dingwen sent people to contact our Xinxiang County Command to discuss the matter of defecting. That evening, he led more than 80 men, carrying 4 light machine guns and more than 70 rifles and pistols, to defect to us collectively. The Hehe stronghold was immediately recovered by us.

　　新乡合河敌集训中队
    全部向我投诚
    【太行电】新乡西二十余里之合河据点的守敌合河乡集训中队，在中队长李鼎文率领下全部向我投诚。由于我军解放郑州、开封与道清线西端获得一连串重大胜利，该中队开始动摇。当时李部还曾梦想逃往国民党军临时占据的获嘉城，但驻守该城的蒋匪却不准他们进城，让他们在城外充当炮灰。事实明白的告诉了李部：跟随国民党反动派，其最终的下场，除了替国民党反动派白白送死或被反动派抛弃以外，别无他途。神速进展的人民解放军，在本月二日解放了获嘉城，豫北蒋匪已完全陷于“上天无路，入地无门”的绝境，三日上午合河乡集训中队队长李鼎文派人与我新乡县指挥部接洽，商谈投诚事宜后，当晚即率部八十余人携带轻机枪四挺、长短枪七十余支，集体向我投诚，合河据点当即为我收复。
