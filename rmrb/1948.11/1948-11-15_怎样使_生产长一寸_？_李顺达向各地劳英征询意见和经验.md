　　How to Make "Production Grow an Inch"?
  　Li Shunda Seeks Opinions and Experiences from Labor Heroes in Various Regions

　　[Report from this newspaper] Taihang first-class labor hero Li Shunda's five-year plan for prosperity and construction, formulated in 1946, is now mostly completed after two and a half years of effort. He is currently summarizing the previous plan and making a new one for the future, and has specially invited well-known heroes and heads of various agencies in the county to assist him. He has also written letters to solicit opinions and experiences from heroes in various parts of Taihang to help him, in order to jointly and enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's call to "make production grow an inch." The original letter is as follows:

　　Shi Cunjin, Xiang Tishui, Zhang Xigui, and all the heroes of the Taihang region:

　　It has been two years since we parted at the Changzhi meeting in 1946, and I am very concerned about your production and prosperity. In the spring of 1946, after a family meeting, I formulated a five-year plan for prosperity and construction, which has now been largely completed after two and a half years of effort by the whole family (some have exceeded the plan, some have not completed it)! I recently held several family meetings, and the whole family agreed to summarize this autumn, gain some experience, and then make a new plan.

　　It is now determined that the official summary will be held on November 3rd. I have specially invited Comrade Chen Yushan, Secretary of the County Party Committee, County Chief Zhao, District Chief Wang, Branch Secretary Li Xingwen, as well as Guo Shuanglong, Guo Yu'en, Wang Siniu, Fang Lianxi, Shi Yuechang, Zhang Jianfu, Yang Yonggao, Song Xiaoqiu, Sang Jiabin, Cui Fubao, and dozens of other heroes to come and help guide us. I would very much like to invite you to participate in the guidance, but I also think: firstly, you are too busy with autumn plowing, grain storage, ending land reform, and preparing for winter production; secondly, the journey is long and inconvenient. Therefore, I ask you to write to me and provide some opinions and experiences to help me make a better plan for the future and complete it better. I also hope to have more contact in the future. Greetings!

　　Li Shunda, October 25th

　　怎样使“生产长一寸”？
  　李顺达向各地劳英征询意见和经验
    【本报讯】太行头等劳动英雄李顺达在一九四六年订出的五年发家建设计划，经过二年半的努力，现在大部分已经完成。现正总结以前计划，再订今后计划，特聘请了全县的有名英雄和各机关负责人进行帮助。并曾写信征求太行各地英雄意见和经验，予以帮助，以共同响亮的响应毛主席“生产长一寸”的号召。原信如下：
    石寸金、向提水、张喜贵及太行全区英雄们：
    咱们自四六年长治会议离别后，已有两年没有见面，我非常关怀大家的生产发家事情。我在四六年春，经过家庭会议，订出了五年发家建设计划，现在经过全家人二年半的努力，已大部分完成啦（有的超过了，有的未完成）！我最近开了几次家庭会议，全家都同意在今年秋后总结一下，得些经验，再订新的计划。
    现确定于十一月三日正式总结。特聘请我县县委书记陈玉山、赵县长、王区长、分书李兴文以及郭双龙、郭玉恩、王四妞、方连喜、史悦昌、张建福、杨永高、宋小秋、桑嘉彬、崔富保等数十位英雄前来帮助指导。我很想聘请大家来参加指导，可是我又想到：一来是秋耕、屯粮、结束土改、准备冬季生产，工作太忙；二来是路途遥远、往返不便，因此我要求大家给我来信，提供些意见与经验，以帮助我把今后计划订的好些，完成的好一些。并望今后多取联系。敬礼！
    李顺达十月二十五日
