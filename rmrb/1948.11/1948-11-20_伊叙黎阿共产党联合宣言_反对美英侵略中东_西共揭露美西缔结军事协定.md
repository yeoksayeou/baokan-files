Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th:
    Reuter Cairo, 9th: To stop the war created by American and British imperialism in Palestine, to cancel all oil privileges granted to foreign groups, and to establish an independent and democratic state in the Arab part of Palestine, these are the main points of the nine-point program declaration jointly issued by the Iraqi Communist Party, the Syrian Communist Party, the Lebanese Communist Party, and the National Liberation League (an organization of Arab communists in the Arab part of Palestine). The declaration points out that the current rulers of Syria and Lebanon are selling the independence of the two countries to the American and British blocs. Together with the current Arab reactionaries and Turkey, they are carrying out conspiracies such as the "Greater Syria Plan" and the anti-Soviet "Eastern Bloc" under the direct protection of the United States, which increases the threat to the independence of all Arab nations. The declaration vows to unite and fight against the "Greater Syria Plan" of Syrian King Abdullah and the British Foreign Office. The declaration demands a complete cessation of provocative and hostile policies towards the Soviet Union, and the strengthening of economic and political friendship, ties, and cooperation with the great socialist countries. The Communist Party is illegal in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, which are under martial law, arbitrary arrests, and special decrees.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: TASS, Prague, 9th: The Spanish Republic's Pyrenees Radio broadcast a statement by the Political Bureau of the Spanish Communist Party, exposing that the Spanish Franco fascist regime has concluded a secret military agreement with the US High Command. The statement points out that this is the result of recent visits to Spain by official and unofficial US military representatives and meetings with Franco and his staff, as well as visits to the US by Franco's delegation. The conclusion of this agreement has been admitted by Franco in his speech in southwestern Spain on the 12th of last month. However, in order to prevent the reactionary nature of the Western European military alliance from being completely exposed, Franco will probably not be able to openly join this alliance for the time being. The statement calls on the Spanish people to intensify their struggle against Franco and his imperialist protectors, as well as against the reactionary social democrats of the Prieto ilk. The Political Bureau urges all Spanish communists to guide the Spanish people against Franco with an unwavering fighting spirit and willingness to sacrifice. The statement further states that in order to overthrow Franco as soon as possible and restore the republic, it is necessary to establish a broader foundation for the resistance movement against Franco and the Spanish fascists. The statement finally calls on all democratic and progressive forces in the world to strengthen vigilance and resolutely protest against US imperialism turning Spain into an imperialist war base for carrying out aggression against freedom-loving and peace-loving countries.

    反对美英侵略中东
  　西共揭露美西缔结军事协定
    【新华社陕北十四日电】电通社开罗九日讯：制止美英帝国主义在巴勒斯坦所制造的战争、取消给予外国集团的一切石油特权、并在巴勒斯坦阿拉伯部分建立独立民主的国家，这些便是伊（拉克）共产党、叙（利亚）共产党、黎（巴嫩）共产党与民族解放同盟（在巴勒斯坦阿拉伯部分的阿拉伯共产党人的组织）共同发表的九点纲领宣言中的要点。宣言指出：目前叙、黎两国统治者之出卖两国独立给美英集团，它们和目前阿拉伯反动派与土耳其一起，在美国的直接庇护下所进行的“大叙利亚计划”与反苏“东方集团”等阴谋，增大了对一切阿拉伯民族独立的威胁。宣言约许联合一致，进行反对叙利亚国王阿布杜拉及英外交部的“大叙利亚计划”的斗争。宣言要求完全停止对苏挑衅与敌视的政策，并加强与伟大的社会主义国家经济政治友谊的联系与合作。共产党在伊拉克及叙、黎两国是非法的，这些国家正处在戒严、横暴逮捕及特别法令的统治之下。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社布拉格九日讯：西班牙共和国比利乃卡电台广播西班牙共产党政治局的声明，揭露西班牙佛朗哥法西斯政权已与美国高级指挥部缔结秘密军事协定。声明指出：这是最近美国官方与非官方军事代表访问西班牙与佛朗哥及其参谋部人员会谈以及佛朗哥代表团访美的结果。这一协定的订立已由佛朗哥在上月十二日为西班牙西南部南部演说中承认。但为使西欧军事联盟之反动本质不致完全暴露，佛朗哥大概尚不可能公开参加这一联盟。声明号召西班牙人民加紧进行反佛朗哥及其帝国主义保护者以及反动的社会民主党人普累托之流的斗争。政治局敦促西班牙一切共产党人应以坚定不移的战斗精神和牺牲准备，指导西班牙人民反对佛朗哥。声明更称：为早日推翻佛朗哥并恢复共和国，必须为反对佛朗哥和西班牙法西斯分子的抵抗运动建立更广泛的基础。声明最后呼吁全世界民主进步力量加强警惕，坚决抗议美帝国主义把西班牙变成进行反对爱好自由和平国家的帝国主义战争前进基地。”
