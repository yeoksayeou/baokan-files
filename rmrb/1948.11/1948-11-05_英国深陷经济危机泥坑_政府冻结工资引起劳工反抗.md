Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: The Soviet journal "New Times," issue No. 28, published in July this year, contains an article by Boliakov entitled "On Britain's Economic Difficulties," which provides a profound depiction of Britain's current bleak economic situation. The article states: Three years have passed since the end of the war, and Britain is falling deeper and deeper into the quagmire of economic crisis. The root cause of Britain's economic difficulties lies in the low level of its industrial and agricultural production over the past thirty years. Before the Second World War, this low level was compensated for by profits from overseas. However, after the war, this source of profit has been greatly reduced, and in reality, Britain has found itself bankrupt. The British rulers originally expected that the loan obtained from the United States in 1946 would support its declining economy for five years, but this loan was used up in one year. Since last autumn, Britain has been using its gold reserves at a rate of 50 million pounds per month, but these reserves will actually only last until the autumn, or at most until the end of this year. The "aid" of the Marshall Plan can only make up for one-third of Britain's huge expenditure deficit, and due to the harsh conditions, it is bound to make Britain's economic situation even worse.

The British government's policy is to fix wages while prices are rising, requiring workers to consume less. According to official materials, the consumption of basic foodstuffs in Britain in the past year has been greatly reduced compared with before the war, with fat consumption down by 50 percent and meat and sugar down by 25 percent. Britain, which thirty years ago supplied half the world with textiles, is now itself very short of textiles. A huge scale of black markets and inflation is corroding the nation's lifeline. The amount of currency issued in Britain is now three times what it was before the war. British ministers often say that British industry is returning to its pre-war level, but they forget that Britain was living in crisis in 1938. British industry has stagnated for thirty-five years. And Britain's two major industries—coal mining and textiles—are still far below their low pre-war levels.

When the Labour government came to power, it announced that its primary goal was to increase exports to 110 to 180 percent of pre-war figures in order to balance its imports. However, this plan is encountering great difficulties, one of which is competition from the United States. Britain's increased export earnings are being taken away by higher-priced American imports. Britain's trade deficit for the last four months of 1947 was over 117 million pounds, and in the first four months of 1948, although exports increased and imports decreased, the deficit was still 100 million pounds, almost the same as before. This policy of sacrificing domestic consumption to increase exports has largely failed to solve its economic difficulties.

The fundamental and direct cause of Britain's economic and financial difficulties is its maintenance of a huge army or its unsound foreign policy. It maintains a military force of one million, six times larger than before the war, and 600,000 workers are busy supplying this army. Of the 1.055 billion pounds deficit in payments over two years, military expenditure accounts for 56 percent (Note: In 1948, Britain's military expenditure accounted for 25 percent of the total budget). It also spends millions of pounds to support reactionary forces in Greece, Turkey, and other countries. This is the reason for the erosion of American funds and most of the gold reserves. Britain is now facing a choice: either change its foreign policy or reduce the living standards of its people once again, thereby moving closer to economic collapse.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: TASS, London: The living standards of the British working class are constantly declining under the Labour government's policy of freezing wages. Recent published wage and price indices show that from January to the end of August this year, the prices of textiles and shoes rose by 30 percent, and other daily necessities also rose by 20 percent, while wages increased by only 3 percent. The decline in the purchasing power of the general laboring masses is reflected in the average drop of more than 10 percent in the sales volume of retail daily necessities during the same period. This situation is causing labor resistance. According to statistics from the British Ministry of Labor cited by TASS, a total of 138 strike incidents occurred in British industry in August, involving 34,000 people, which is more than the total for July and August of last year.

### 英国深陷经济危机泥坑  政府冻结工资引起劳工反抗

    英国深陷经济危机泥坑
    政府冻结工资引起劳工反抗
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】今年七月出版的苏联新时代周刊第二十八期登载波里亚科夫所著“论英国的经济困境”一文，对英国当前黯淡的经济形势作了深刻的刻画该文写道：战争结束已三年，而英国正掉在经济危机的泥坑里愈陷愈深。英国经济困难的根源在于它三十年来工业与农业生产水平的低下。在二次大战之前，这种低下水平是由海外得到的利润来弥补的。但战后这种利润来源已大大减少，实际上英国发现它已破产了。英国统治者原期一九四六年自美国得来的借款，可支持其衰退的经济五年之久，但这笔借款一年就用光了。英国去秋以来动用其黄金储备，每月达五千万镑，但这种储备实际上仅延续至秋季，顶多至今年年底。马歇尔计划的“援助”仅能弥补英国庞大支出赤字的三分之一，而由于条件的苛刻，它势将使英国的经济形势更加恶化。
    英政府的政策是在物价高涨下固定工资，要工人要少地消费。根官方的材料，英国过去一年中基本食品的消费量已较战前大大降低，脂肪消费量降低了百分之五十，肉类与糖降低了百分之二十五。三十年前曾以纺织品供给半个世界的英国，今天它自己都非常缺乏纺织品。巨大规模的黑市、通货膨胀正腐蚀着国家的命脉。英国的通货发行量已达战前的三倍。英国大臣们常说，英国工业正回到战前的水平，但他们忘记，英国在一九三八年时曾生活在危机之中。英国工业已停滞了三十五年。而英国两大工业——采煤与纺织业，现在仍然大大低于战前的低下水平。
    工党政府上台时曾宣布提高出口至战前数字百分之一百一十至一百八十为其第一目标，来平衡它的进口。但这一计划正遇到很大的困难，其中之一即是美国的竞争。英国增加出口的收入正为更高价格的美国进口货所夺去。英国一九四七年最后四个月进出口的逆差是一亿一千七百多镑，而在一九四八年头四个月，虽然增加了出口和减低了进口，逆差仍是一亿零百万镑。几乎和前者一样。这种牺牲国内消费以提高出口的政策，多未能解决它的经济困难。
    英国经济与财政困难的基本与直接的原因，是由于它维持庞大的军队或不健全的外交政策。它保持着比战前大六倍的百万兵力，六十万工人正忙于供应这支军队。在两年十亿零五千五百万镑的支付赤字中，军事开支占了百分之五十六（按：一九四八年英国的军费占总预算的百分之二十五）。它同时花费成百万镑去支持希、土及其他国家的反动势力。这就是蚀去美国款与大部黄金储备的原因。英国现在正面对一个取舍：或者改变它的外交政策，或者对其人民生活水准再一次减低，从而更接近于经济的崩溃。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】电通社伦敦讯：英国工人阶级的生活水平，在工党政府冻结工资的政策下正不断下降。最近发表的工资与物价指数表明，自今年一月至八月底，纺织品与鞋子价格上涨百分之三十，其他日用品亦上涨百分之二十，而工资则仅增加百分之三。一般劳动群众的购买力的下降，反映出同一时期零售日用品销售量平均跌落百分之十以上。这种情势正引起劳工的反抗。据塔斯社引英劳工部的统计，八月份中，英国工业中共发生罢工事件一三八件，参加人数达三万四千人，即较去年的七、八月份合计还多。
