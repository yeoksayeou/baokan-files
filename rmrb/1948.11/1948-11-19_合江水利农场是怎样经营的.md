The Construction Department of the Heli River Provincial Government erected a few "melon-watching shacks" (as the local residents humorously called them at the time) on a large meadow about forty miles northeast of Jiamusi City and began building a water conservancy farm. One year later, more than 810 hectares (10 acres per hectare) of wilderness have been transformed into paddy fields, with an average yield of 15 shi (approximately 1920 kg) of grain per hectare, capable of harvesting more than 5 million jin (approximately 2.5 million kg) of grain. Therefore, the villagers in nearby villages have changed from suspicion to envy, unanimously praising the farm's abundant rice harvest and the democratic government's good leadership and management of the farm, and even requesting that their dry land be turned into paddy fields to grow rice. Even villagers from Liushuhezi in Jixian County, hundreds of miles away, sent representatives to visit and expressed that some of them were willing to come to the farm to grow paddy fields.

The farm is directly under the leadership of the Provincial Construction Department. Under the general farm, there are an electric water tower, an electric rice mill, a flour mill, and a warehouse; in addition, there are four paddy field farms. Under the director and instructor, the general farm has two sections: management and general affairs. There are a total of twenty staff and miscellaneous workers. The general farm has offices, granaries, warehouses, machine rooms, clinics, bathhouses, staff and worker dormitories, and two neat stables, raising more than two hundred fat and strong horses. Electric lights, chaff cutters, and soybean cake cutters will soon be installed. The farm's electric water tower is located on the bank of the Songhua River, with two 330-horsepower electric water pumps, each capable of pumping 100 cubic meters of water per minute, irrigating all the farm's paddy fields. The four paddy field farms are built on the banks of the Jimu River, where immigrants who grow paddy fields live. There are also more than one hundred hired workers, who are responsible for guarding the water tower, mill, repairing farm tools, driving carts, and feeding livestock. Starting from the general farm, it takes 48 li (approximately 24 km) to go around the water tower and each farm.

The farm's management methods are divided into cooperative management with farmers and employee management. A total of 344 households, 1357 people, participated in cooperative management, all immigrants from Jiamusi, Boli, and other places. The farm provides them with land and houses (the land and house rights belong to the farm, and they live and use them without compensation). The farm provides carts, horses, and farm tools. The farm and immigrants each contribute half of the labor when opening up the land. The immigrants are responsible for repairing ponds, sowing, weeding, and harvesting. The farm provides carts and horses to help with transportation. After the autumn harvest, after deducting seeds, the harvest is divided in half. The farm lends the immigrants food, cloth, and even oil and salt, which are borrowed in spring and returned in autumn. Each farm provides immigrants with five hectares of vegetable land for free use. According to this year's harvest, immigrants can get 2,900 jin (approximately 1450 kg) of grain for each hectare they cultivate. On average, each household (generally four people) cultivates 2.3 hectares and can get 6,700 to 6,800 jin of rice. Due to the adoption of cooperative management methods, the interests of the immigrants and the farm are aligned. In addition, under the leadership of the farmers' association, the implementation of collective use of land in groups, collective cooperation in labor, distribution according to work, and the mobilization of competitions and rewards have greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses for production and brought into play the labor efficiency of cooperation and mutual assistance. The income of immigrants from operating paddy fields, vegetable gardens, and side businesses is enough to cover their annual food, clothing, and expenses, and the surplus grain is enough to eat for the next year, laying the initial foundation for labor to become rich. Many families raise chickens, dogs, geese, ducks, pigs, and rabbits. Large strings of dried fish and various dried vegetables are drying in front of their doors. Schools in each farm have been built, and as soon as all the rice is stored in the warehouse, children can go to school.

The wages of more than one hundred hired workers (long-term workers) are paid monthly. A democratic wage evaluation method was adopted. According to each person's skills and work enthusiasm, in conjunction with checking labor agreements, they are graded and discussed.

The farm's management initially faced many difficulties and shortcomings. In addition to having no experience in establishing a farm, the most important thing was the poor planning of the leading authorities, the inappropriate allocation of cadres, and the serious waste of materials. After April, the farm began to rectify. (1) Strengthen leadership and adjust cadres. Under the leadership of the director, a farm management committee was formed, with the participation of staff and workers. The cadre force was re-equipped, and a more specific division of labor was implemented. Ideological education for cadres was strengthened, many incorrect ideas were criticized, so that everyone had a correct understanding, and everyone was asked to work in the farm with peace of mind and be proficient in business. Corrupt elements were punished, and incompetent cadres were replaced. Streamlining was implemented, reducing staff by twenty-six people. (2) Regular systems for leave, meetings, reports, studies, budgets, accounting, and cashier were established. Specific measures for labor discipline, rewards and punishments, and conservation were formulated. (3) Strengthen worker education. Political lessons were given to workers in the evening, supplemented by individual talks. As a result, the workers' awareness gradually increased. The workers' work efficiency and sense of responsibility have been greatly improved. This spring, one person could feed ten horses, now one person can feed fourteen horses. From December last year to February this year, the carts had to replace two sick animals almost every week, and only one horse has been replaced in the last two or three months.

Over the past year, the progress of the water conservancy farm has been obvious. These are the results of constantly overcoming difficulties and shortcomings. The farm still has many shortcomings, and the education of cadres, workers, and immigrants is not enough. The future direction of the farm is: (1) To more organized and planned strengthen the business and policy learning of cadres, and improve the cadres another step. (2) To strengthen the class education and technical education of workers and immigrants, and to give greater play to the efficiency of collective labor, so that the farm can carry out production more planned next year. (3) To strengthen and adhere to various systems, truly achieve scientific management, and gradually move towards enterprise.

### 合江水利农场是怎样经营的

　　合江水利农场是怎样经营的
    合江省府建设厅在佳木斯市东北四十余里的大草甸子上，搭起了几间“看瓜的小草棚”（当地居民当时这样诙谐地称呼它），开始修建水利农场。一年后的今天，八百一十余垧（每垧十亩）的荒野，已变成了稻田，平均每垧产粮十五石，可收获五百余万斤粮食。因此，附近几个屯子的老乡们，由怀疑变为羡慕，同声赞扬农场稻田的丰收和民主政府对农场领导和经营得好，进而要求把他们的旱田也变为水田，来种稻子。连百里外的集贤县柳树河子的老乡也派了代表来参观，并表示他们也有人愿来农场种水田。
    该场直属省建设厅领导。在总场下，有电机水楼、电力制米、制粉厂和仓库；另外还有四个水田农庄。总场在场长、指导员下，设经营、总务两科。共有工作及杂务人员二十人。总场内，有办公室、粮仓、库房、机器房、医务所、澡塘、职员、工人宿舍，并有两栋整洁马厩，喂养着二百余匹肥壮的大马。不久即将装置电灯、铡草机和切豆饼机。农场的电机水楼在松花江边，有两台三百三十匹马力的电动抽水机，每台每分钟可抽水一百立方米，灌溉全场稻田。四个水田农庄，建立在集木河两岸住着种稻田的移民。另有百余雇工，分任看管水楼、磨房、修理农具、赶车、喂牲口等职务。由总场出发，经水楼环绕各农庄一周，得走四十八里路。
    农场的经营方式，分为与农民合作经营和雇工经营两种。参加合作经营的农民共三四四户，一三五七人，都是来自佳木斯、勃利等地的移民。农场给他们土地和房子（地权、房权为场方所有，无代价居住使用）。车马、农具由场方供给。开地时农场与移民各出一半人工。修池、下种、薅草、收割由移民负担。场方出车马协助拉场。秋后打粮除去籽种，对半平分。场方借给移民吃粮、布匹以至油盐等物，春借秋还，每个农庄供移民无代价使用五垧菜地。按今年收成，移民种一垧地，可分得二千九百斤粮。平均每户（一般四口人）种二垧三亩，可分六千七、八百斤稻子。由于采取了合作经营的方式，使移民利益与农场利益取得一致。加上他们在农会领导下，实行了以小组为单位的集体使用土地，集体合作进行劳动，按劳取酬，发动竞赛与奖励等办法，大大刺激了群众的生产积极性，发挥了合作互助的劳动效率。移民经营稻田、菜地、副业的收入，除够全年吃穿零用外，余粮还够明年吃，打下了劳动致富的初步基础。很多人家都养了鸡、犬、鹅、鸭、猪、以及兔子。门前晒着大串的干鱼、各种干菜。各农庄学校已修好，一俟稻子全部入仓，儿童们即可入学念书。
    百余雇工（长工）都是按月付工资的。采用了民主评议工资的办法。按每人技术、劳动积极性，配合检查劳动公约，分等评议讨论。
    该农场经营最初存在很多困难和缺点。除对创办农场无经验外，最重要的是领导机关的计划性差，干部配备不适当，物力浪费很严重。四月以后，农场开始整顿。（一）加强领导和调整干部。在场长领导下组成了农场管理委员会，吸收职员及工人参加。重新配备了干部力量，实行了比较具体的分工。加强对干部的思想教育，批评了许多不正确的思想，使大家有正确的认识，要大家安心搞农场工作，精通业务。惩治了贪污分子，撤换了不称职的干部。实行精简，减裁冗员二十六人。（二）规定了请假、会议、汇报、学习、预决算、会计、出纳等正规制度。订立了劳动纪律、奖惩、节约等具体办法。（三）加强工人教育。在晚上给工人上政治课，辅以个别谈话。因此，工人觉悟逐步提高。工人工作效率与责任心大有改进，今春一个人能喂十匹马，如今一人能喂十四匹。去年十二月至今年二月，大车上每星期差不多要换两匹出毛病的牲口，最近两三个月，只换了一匹马。
    一年来，水利农场的进步是明显的。这都是不断地克服困难和缺点的结果。该场现在尚存在着不少缺点，对干部、工人和移民的教育方面，做得不够。今后该场努力的方向是：（一）更有组织、有计划地加强干部的业务与政策学习，把干部提高一步。（二）加强工人和移民的阶级教育和技术教育，更大地发挥集体劳动的效率，使农场明年能更有计划地进行生产。（三）加强和坚持各种制度，真正做到科学的管理，逐步走向企业化。　　　　　　（新华社东北电）
