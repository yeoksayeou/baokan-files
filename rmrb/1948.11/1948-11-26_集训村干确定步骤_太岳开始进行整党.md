　　Training Village Cadres, Determining Steps
  　Taiyue Begins Party Rectification
    This newspaper combines Taiyue dispatches: In order to implement Party rectification democracy and end land reform, the Taiyue District Party Committee held an expanded cadre meeting in September, which made a correct estimate of the Party's situation in the entire district, and determined the Party rectification policy, steps, methods, and specific requirements. After the meeting, various regions, combined with the local work situation, made the necessary preparations, and successively trained Party member village cadres, divided village types, and determined specific steps. At present, many counties have completed preparations and are beginning to enter Party rectification; individual places (such as Yicheng) have concluded the first batch of Party rectification villages and have gained preliminary experience. The following is an introduction to some of the situation: The First Prefectural Committee (North Yue) from September to October 16, trained a total of 1,098 district and village cadres in two phases. In addition, Qin Yuan, Qin County, Tunliu, Anze, Changzi, Huoxian, Lingshi and other counties all formulated specific plans based on the typical survey situation before October 25, and held expanded cadre meetings in the entire county, spending five days to half a month discussing and arranging work. Cadres in various counties all arrived in the villages before November 2 to begin work. Regarding the work steps, it is generally stipulated to be completed in three phases. The entire North Yue area has 1,106 villages (Lingshi not included). The first phase can complete 243 villages, and can be roughly concluded before November 20th of the lunar calendar. The second phase can complete 408 villages in the entire region, and can be concluded by the end of the lunar year. The third phase will complete 454 villages and will be completed by the end of February of the lunar calendar.
    Preliminary Party rectification methods in various places: One is to carry out the rectification in the village, and the other is to concentrate rural Party members for training in units of districts (to be specifically applied according to the concentration and dispersion of villages). The method of concentrating Party members for rectification in units of districts should be decided after the end of the first phase, and generally should not be widely adopted.
    Other regions are also proceeding, such as Fushan, which held a county-wide expanded cadre meeting on October 10. It was decided that in the 79 administrative villages in the county, the first batch of 30 administrative villages would be tackled first. Now 150 cadres have been drawn out and will arrive in the villages around the 12th to begin combining with the masses' autumn tillage, understand the situation, and carry out propaganda. The first phase of Party rectification villages in the second and third districts of Jiyuan, such as Miaodian, held a general meeting of all Party members (66 people) on November 3 to convey the purpose and methods of Party rectification, and to inspire everyone to recognize the necessity of Party rectification and consciously carry out Party rectification. After the meeting, Party members returned to their villages to conduct deliberation and discussion. At the beginning, many Party members were not enthusiastic. After the leadership discovered these problems, they asked the Party branch members to discuss why Party rectification was necessary and whether it would be okay not to rectify, so that Party members realized the importance of Party rectification. Miaodian Party members said: "We are covered in shit, and if we continue like this, we will fall into the ditch." Dongguo Zhengxue said: "After listening to the report, I realized that I have completely alienated myself from the masses. How can we not rectify?" Dong Matou Li Yingxi said: "Our Party members are still of one mind. We can't do without rectification." Zhong Matou Lian Guiyun said: "We are like a tree, which will bend with a small breeze and fall with a big wind; Party rectification is like taking root. If we don't rectify, we will fall." Now Party members in various villages have begun to conduct criticism and self-criticism, and the consciousness of Party rectification has generally been improved a step further.

### 集训村干确定步骤　太岳开始进行整党

　　集训村干确定步骤
  　太岳开始进行整党
    本报综合太岳来电：为贯彻整党民主与结束土改，太岳区党委九月曾召开扩干会议，对全区党的情况作了正确估计，确定了整党方针步聚方法与具体要求。会后各地区结合本地工作情况，都做了必要的准备，各地先后集训党员村干，划分类型村，确定具体步骤等。现不少县份准备工作已经完毕，开始进入整党；个别地方（如翼城）第一批整党村已告结束，且取得初步经验。兹将部分情况介绍于后：一地委（岳北）自九月起到十月十六日，曾分两次集训了各县的区村干部一千零九十八人，此外沁源、沁县、屯留、安泽、长子、霍县、灵石等县，则都在十月廿五日以前，依据典型调查的情况，定出具体计划，召开了全县扩干会议，用五天至半月的时间讨论布置工作。各县干部，均在十一月二日以前到村开始工作。关于工作步骤，一般规定三期完成。全岳北区一千一百零六个村（灵石未计），第一期可完成二百四十三村，阴历十一月二十日前可大概结束。第二期全区可完成四百零八村，阴历年底可告结束。第三期完成四百五十四个村，阴历二月底完成。
    各地初步整党方法：一种是在村里进行，一种是以区为单位集中农村党员进行训练（视村庄的集中分散而具体运用）。关于以区为单位集中整党的办法，要在第一期结束后决定取舍，一般不普遍采用。
    其他地区进行情况，如浮山是十月十日召开的全县扩干会议。决定在全县七十九个行政村中，第一批先搞三十个行政村。现已抽出一百五十个干部，在十二号左右到村，开始结合群众秋垡，了解情况，进行宣传。济源二、三区第一期整党村苗店等十个村，十一月三日召开了全体党员（六十六人）大会，传达整党目的与作法，启发大家认清整党的必要，自觉进行整党。大会结束后，党员即回到本村进行酝酿讨论。开始时，许多党员情绪不高，领导上发现这些问题后，便让村支部党员讨论为啥要整党，不整行不行，使党员认识到整党的重要。苗店党员说：“咱一屁股屎，再这样下去就要跌沟里了”。东郭正学说：“听了报告，想起自己把群众脱离光了，不整还行？”东马头李迎喜说：“咱们党员还是一个一条心，不整可不行”。中马头连贵云说：“咱们好比一棵树，小风一吹就歪，大风一吹就倒；整党好比扎根，再不整就倒了。”现在各村党员已开始进行批评与自我批评，对整党的自觉性一般都提高了一步。
