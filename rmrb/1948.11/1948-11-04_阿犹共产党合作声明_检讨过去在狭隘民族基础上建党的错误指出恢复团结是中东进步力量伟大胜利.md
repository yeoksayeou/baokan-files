Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 25th, Electone News Agency, Tel Aviv: The merger of the Arab Communist Party (i.e., the Arab National Liberation League) and the Jewish Communist Party (i.e., the Palestinian Communist Party) into the Israeli Communist Party marks a significant development in the struggle of the Palestinian people and all the peoples of the Middle East for national independence. In a statement issued simultaneously, the two organizations stated: "The historically significant decision of the Arab and Jewish Communist Parties to restore international unity is a great victory for the progressive forces in Palestine and throughout the Middle East, and a major blow to the conspiracies of Anglo-American imperialism." The statements of the two parties particularly emphasized the great role of the Soviet Union in the anti-imperialist struggle, and pointed out the importance of learning from the great experience of the Bolshevik Party. These experiences prove that the friendship of the people of all nationalities is an important weapon in the struggle against imperialism and reactionaries. This merger decision is the result of lengthy discussions between the two parties. In its statement, the Central Committees of the two organizations deeply reviewed the political and organizational errors they had committed in the past, mainly building the party on a narrow national basis. The statement pointed out that the future task of the Communist Party is to organize the communist movement on an internationalist basis. The merger eliminates the division within the Palestinian Communist Party since 1946. (At that time, Arab communists broke away from the Palestinian Communist Party and formed the National Liberation League.) After the merger, all party members and branches within Israel will join the Israeli Communist Party, and in those areas of Palestine where an independent democratic Arab state should be established, the National Liberation League will continue to exist and will cooperate closely with the Jewish communists in those areas.

    阿犹共产党合作声明
    检讨过去在狭隘民族基础上建党的错误指出恢复团结是中东进步力量伟大胜利
    【新华社陕北一日电】电通社特拉维夫十月二十五日讯：阿拉伯共产党（即阿拉伯民族解放同盟）与犹太共产党（即巴勒斯坦共产党）之合并为以色列共产党，标志着巴勒斯坦人民及中东一切人民争取民族独立斗争的重大发展。两组织在其同时发表的声明中指出：“阿犹共产党恢复国际团结的有历史意义的决定，是巴勒斯坦及整个中东进步力量的伟大胜利，是对美英帝国主义阴谋的重大打击。”两党声明特别强调苏联在反帝斗争中的伟大作用，并指出学习布尔什维克党伟大经验的重要性。这些经验证明：各民族人民的友谊，是与帝国主义及反动派作斗争的重要武器。这一合并决定是两党长时讨论的结果。两组织的中央委员会在其声明中曾深刻检讨过去在政治上及组织上所犯的错误，主要的是在狭隘的民族基础上去建立党。声明指出共产党今后的任务是在国际主义基础上去组织共产主义运动。两党的合并消除了一九四六年以来巴勒斯坦共产党内部的分裂。（当时，阿拉伯共产党人脱离了巴勒斯坦共产党，另组民族解放同盟。）合并之后，以色列国境内的一切党员与支部均将加入以色列共产党，在巴勒斯坦应成立独立民主阿拉伯国的那些地区，民族解放同盟则将继续存在，并将与这些地区的犹太共产党人密切合作。
