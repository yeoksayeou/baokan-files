　　A Sign of a Major Change Beginning in Yan's Army in Taiyuan
    Zhao Rui, Commander of the 8th Corps of Yan's Army,
  　Leads His Troops in Surrender to Us
    [Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Front, 12th] Zhao Rui, Commander of the 8th Corps of Yan's Army, led his troops in surrender to us on the morning of the 12th. This is a sign of a major change beginning in Yan's army in Taiyuan. After our army occupied Naoma, the prominent main position on the last defense line of Yan's bandit army in Dongtun, Yan's bandit army launched desperate counterattacks for days, attempting to recapture this position. On the 11th alone, Yan's bandits drove the 30th Division and its 8th Corps to counterattack our Naoma position five times, but were repelled by our army, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. Yan's bandits became even more anxious and forced Zhao Rui, commander of the 8th Corps, to personally lead his troops to continue the counterattack. Zhao Rui, seeing the power of the People's Liberation Army and that Yan Xishan's defeat was inevitable, and that continuing the counterattack would only result in further unnecessary sacrifices, resolutely led his troops to surrender to us automatically at dawn today, and submitted the orders issued by Yan's bandits to our front-line command. Our army immediately expressed its welcome. This is a good example for the Yan's army officers and soldiers trapped in Taiyuan and forced to risk their lives for Yan's bandits. Only uprising and surrendering or laying down their weapons early is their only way out; stubbornly resisting for Yan's bandits is seeking their own death.

　　太原阎匪开始重大变化的标志
    阎军第八总队司令
  　赵瑞率部向我投诚
    【新华社太原前线十二日电】阎军第八总队司令赵瑞于十二日晨率部向我投诚。这是太原阎匪军开始重大变化的标志。当我军占领阎匪东屯最后防线上的突出主要阵地淖马后，阎匪连日拼命反扑，企图夺回这一阵地。十一日一天阎匪即驱使三十师及其第八总队向我淖马阵地反扑五次，均被我军击退，敌伤亡惨重。阎匪更加着急，又迫令其第八总队司令赵瑞亲自率部继续向我反扑，赵瑞鉴于解放军的强大，阎锡山大势已去，如继续反扑，只有再作无谓牺牲，乃于本日拂晓毅然率部自动向我投诚，并将阎匪所发给命令交呈我前线指挥部。我军当即表示欢迎。这对于困守太原为阎匪逼迫卖命的阎军官兵是一个很好的榜样。只有起义投诚或提早放下武器，才是他们的唯一生路；替阎匪卖命顽抗，就是自求死亡。
