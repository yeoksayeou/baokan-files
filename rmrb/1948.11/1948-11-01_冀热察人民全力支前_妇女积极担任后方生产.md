    The People of Hebei-Rehe-Chahar Fully Support the Front
    Women Actively Undertake Production in the Rear
    [Telegram from the Ping-Sui Front] During the large-scale offensive on the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway, the People's Liberation Army received enthusiastic support from the people of the Hebei-Rehe-Chahar Liberated Area. The struggle between the enemy and us in the Hebei-Rehe-Chahar Liberated Area used to be quite fierce. The bandit Fu (Fu Zuoyi) once created a "no-man's land," committing cruel acts of burning, killing, and looting. When the people there heard that the People's Liberation Army was going to fight on the Ping-Sui Line, they excitedly and nervously mobilized. Before the civilian laborers set off, they enthusiastically expressed their determination to "break the Ping-Sui Railway and eliminate the great enemy Fu Zuoyi." Young and middle-aged people in counties such as Chicheng and Longxuanhuai (newly established county) were mobilized, and even the elderly voluntarily participated in transporting ammunition and grain. After two stretcher teams from Longxuanhuai and three stretcher companies from the tenth district of Chicheng went to the front, women took over their work and carried out the autumn harvest. The slogan was "Women are the main force on the production front." Many female cadres in Chicheng County assisted village cadres in collecting grain and firewood, day and night. When there was a shortage of stretchers for transportation at the front, women mobilized to carry stretchers. A total of more than 120 villages in Chicheng County participated in the effort twice, and even women with bound feet voluntarily participated. In Chicheng, Longguan and other places, the people repaired several roads and built more than ten bridges within five days.

    冀热察人民全力支前
    妇女积极担任后方生产
    【平绥前线电】人民解放军在大规模出击平绥路东段作战中，受到冀热察解放区人民热烈支援。冀热察解放区过去敌我斗争相当尖锐，傅匪曾经制造“无人区”，残酷的烧杀、抢掠。当该地人民听说解放军要打平绥线时，都兴奋紧张地动员起来。民工们出发前，热烈表示“打断平绥路，消灭傅作义大仇人”的决心。赤城、龙宣怀（新设县）等县青壮年都动员起来，甚至老年人也自动参加运输弹药粮食。龙宣怀两个担架团，赤城第十区三个抬架连开赴前线后，妇女就代替他们的工作，进行秋收。口号是“妇女是生产前线上的主力军。”赤城县许多妇女干部协助村干部征收粮柴，日夜不休息。当前方运输担架缺乏时，妇女动员起来去抬担架、赤城县前后两次共一百二十余村，有的小脚妇女也自动参加。赤城、龙关等地人民，五天之内，修好数条公路，筑桥十余座。
