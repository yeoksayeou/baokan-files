During the Kuomintang's Brutal Rule
    Xiuhuo Wu Masses Demonstrated Against Conscription
  　Armed Self-Defense to Protect Grain, Labor, and Livestock
    [Taihang Telegram] During the Kuomintang's brutal rule, the broad masses in the Xiu (wu), Huo (jia), and Wu (zhi) triangular area of northern Henan (this area was re-liberated by our army in late October) bravely carried out an anti-Chiang struggle through various forms of struggle such as demonstrations against conscription and armed self-defense. This fully demonstrated the anti-Chiang strength of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas and also exposed the serious crisis of the Kuomintang reactionaries' brutal and corrupt rule. In mid-July, the area suffered a severe flood, and coupled with years of exploitation by the Chiang bandits, it had become a desolate wasteland. However, the Chiang bandits continued to extract the marrow from the bones, extorting in every possible way and forcing the peasants in the countryside to pay grain taxes time and time again. Four puppet heads of villages in the En Village area of Jiaozuo were forced to commit suicide by jumping into wells because they could not bear the torture of the Chiang bandits. The masses, unwilling to endure the Chiang bandits' cruel oppression of forcing grain taxes and conscripting laborers, rose up to resist conscription or fled in droves. In early August, Xiuwu City saw several outbreaks of demonstrations against conscription involving hundreds of peasants from the surrounding villages. The demonstrating masses in a certain village even persisted for a whole day and night. On August 1st, more than 500 people gathered in Xiaozhou Village in the county and went to the puppet township government to petition. Many old men and women participated in the march, leaning on their canes. The masses went directly into the puppet township government, scaring the puppet township head into fleeing. The demonstrating masses angrily smashed all the utensils in the township government, such as pots and bowls, into pieces. Xu Jingshan, the puppet county magistrate of Xiuwu, who was presiding over a meeting in Jiaozuo to plan forced conscription, was also surrounded by two or three hundred petitioners from several villages around Jiaozuo, who refused to pay grain taxes with the grain requisition slips in their hands and questioned him, "There is no grain left, do you want our lives?" Guo Qingxing, the puppet township head of Lifeng Township, even enriched himself by exploiting the people's blood and sweat, seizing seven waterwheels and a large amount of land from the masses in July and August, arousing the anger and resistance of the people of the entire township. Around August 15th, an anti-corruption movement broke out in the area. The masses from twenty surrounding villages spontaneously organized a petition group of more than a thousand people, gathering at the enemy's township government and the Wuzhi puppet county government, shouting slogans such as "Punish Guo Qingxing, compensate the people for the grain he embezzled." Guo Qingxing was finally forced to get out. Villages close to the liberated areas fled to hide grain and laborers as soon as the enemy appeared. In August, the second son of an old woman near Jiaozuo was conscripted into the army by the Chiang bandits. Afterwards, she secretly ran to the edge of Xiuwu City and told her son, "The Eighth Route Army captures many Kuomintang officers and releases them. If you fight the Eighth Route Army, you must sneak away. Don't forget, you were captured." Some masses in the Kuomintang-controlled areas also organized armed self-defense to protect grain, labor, and livestock. In July and August, the masses in Xiu-Huo-Wu and Xiuwu spontaneously organized small armed groups and secretly bought various weapons. The small armed groups in several villages in Xiuwu, in coordination with our armed forces who penetrated deep behind enemy lines, successively destroyed five enemy self-defense regiments, striking at the enemy's small-scale looting and conscription. In August, they secretly colluded to support each other in joint operations, driving away the enemy once when they looted grain and chasing them for more than two li. The small armed group in a certain village repelled the enemy's small-scale raids twice in a row.

　　在国民党残暴统治时期
    修获武群众示威抗征
  　武装自卫保粮保丁保牲口
    【太行电】在国民党残暴统治时期的豫北修（武）获（嘉）武（陟）三角地带的广大群众（该地区在十月下旬已为我军再度解放），曾经以示威抗征，武装自卫各种斗争方式，英勇的进行反蒋斗争。充分显示出蒋区人民的反蒋力量。亦暴露了国民党反动派残暴腐败统治的严重危机。七月中旬该地区遭受严重水灾，再加以蒋匪历年搜刮，已成十室九空。但蒋匪仍继续敲骨吸髓，百般勒索，强逼四乡农民一次又一次缴纳粮款。焦作恩村一带四个伪甲长，因受不过蒋匪的熬煎，被迫跳井自杀。群众不甘忍受蒋匪强逼粮款，强抓壮丁的残酷压迫，遂即奋起抗征，或纷纷逃跑。修武城在八月上旬前后数次暴发四乡农民数百人的集会抗征示威。某村示威群众并曾坚持一天一夜。八月一日该县小周村集聚了五百多人，齐到伪乡公所请愿。许多老汉老婆扶着手杖参加游行。群众直行到伪乡公所内。伪乡长吓得早窜了。示威群众气愤的把乡公所内一切用具锅、碗等砸得粉碎。正在焦作主持开会计划强征的修武伪县长徐景山，亦被焦作周围数村二三百请愿群众包围起来，拿着派粮条拒绝缴纳粮款。并责问他“没有粮了，你要命吧？”李封乡伪乡长郭庆行更以榨取群众的血汗肥己，七八两月就霸占了群众水车七个和大量土地，引起全乡人民愤起反抗。八月十五前后该地爆发了反贪污运动。周围二十个村群众，自动组织起千余人的请愿集团，齐集敌乡公所和武陟伪县府喊出：“惩办郭庆行，赔偿贪污人民的粮食”等口号。郭庆行终于被迫滚蛋。靠近解放区的村庄，一见敌出来即纷纷逃走躲粮躲丁。焦作附近一个老婆的二儿子，在八月间被蒋匪抓去当兵，事后她又偷偷跑至修武城边，对她儿说：“八路军捉住国民党军官很多都放了。你要和八路军打起仗来你要偷跑过去，你可不要忘了，你是让人家抓走的。”国统区有些群众并组织武装自卫，保粮保丁保牲口。七、八两个月修获武与修武就有群众自动组织起小型武装，暗地买了各种武器。修武数村的小型武装，并配合我深入敌后的武装先后摧垮敌五个自卫团。打击敌人的小股抢劫抓丁。八月份他们并秘密串通以联合作战相互支援的方法，打跑敌一次抢粮。追击敌二里多地。某村小型武装曾连续两次打退敌人的小股搜刮活动。
