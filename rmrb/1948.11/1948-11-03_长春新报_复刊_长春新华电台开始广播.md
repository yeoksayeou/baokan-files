Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, October 31st: The cultural life of the newly liberated Changchun City is flourishing with a brand new attitude. The resumption issue of "Changchun Xinbao" was officially published on the fourth day (23rd) after liberation. In front of the "Northeast Daily" posted along the street, crowds of readers gathered. The Changchun branch of the Northeast Bookstore opened for business as early as the morning of the second day of liberation (21st), supplying a large amount of spiritual food needed by the citizens. The Changchun Xinhua Broadcasting Station began broadcasting on the 22nd, and loudspeakers were installed on various bustling streets. Every day at noon and in the evening, the masses stood on the streets listening to the victorious news of the People's Liberation War and various programs. The slogan and cartoon team led by the Northeast Book and Newspaper Agency began working on the second day of liberation. The streets of the city were filled with various announcements, leaflets, and large portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The Changchun citizens, striving for a new life, gathered around the portrait of Chairman Mao. The portraits of Chairman Mao printed by the agency were quickly snatched up by the masses. And all the portraits of the bandit Chiang Kai-shek on the streets of Changchun were torn to pieces by the masses. All personnel from our agencies, troops, and work teams who entered Changchun have been explaining the current situation and various policies of the liberated areas to the masses in recent days, with everyone speaking and everyone publicizing. The Changchun Film Studio's photography team is filming various scenes before and after the liberation of Changchun, which will be screened soon.
