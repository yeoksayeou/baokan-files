"The important thing is to be good at learning." This is a topic written by Comrade Mao Zedong in "Strategic Issues in China's Revolutionary War." Comrade Mao Zedong wrote there about military issues. Judging from the actual victories of the People's Liberation Army, our entire party has responded to Comrade Mao Zedong's call and has largely learned about warfare. Although we cannot be satisfied with this and need to continue learning, to learn more and better. In addition to continuing to learn in the military field, it is clear that today we must especially emphasize learning about economic work and cultural and educational work. For a long time, Comrade Mao Zedong has called on us to learn these two tasks. We have also learned some in the past, done some work, and made creations, even important creations. Therefore, in many of the most difficult years, we have overcome many economic difficulties and raised the political awareness of the masses. Such achievements cannot be erased. However, we should also admit that in these two areas of work, we are still extremely naive, sometimes even ridiculously naive. This is not surprising: first, because the vast majority of our party's outstanding cadres have been busy with military and political work for the past two decades, concentrating their energy in those areas, not in these. Of course, we also have outstanding cadres in the economic and cultural fields, but they are far fewer than in the military and political fields. Second, because the areas we govern were mostly remote rural environments in the past. Large industries were very small, and the issue of commercial struggle existed, but in general, the economic situation was much simpler than it is now. Similarly, the situation in cultural education was also relatively simple. Therefore, past experience is not very useful. Moreover, experience is always two-sided, with correct experience and also wrong experience. Many of our comrades have not seriously studied these past experiences, nor have they seriously understood Comrade Mao Zedong's summaries of these experiences. Therefore, in the new environment, on the one hand, they may not use the correct experiences of the past, and on the other hand, they may repeat the mistakes of the past.

We Communists, as Stalin famously said: "are people of a special mold. We are made of special materials." For us Communists, there is nothing we cannot learn. It is absolutely not impossible to learn, but "the important thing is to be good at learning." As long as we can abide by Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings and be good at learning, then we will win every battle on the economic front and on the cultural and educational front, just as we win every battle on the military front.

No one (not even our enemies) can doubt that we will win a nationwide victory militarily. Our military victory nationwide and the complete crushing of the Kuomintang reactionaries have long been determined. However, the people of the whole country not only need us to have skills in the military field, but also need us to have the same skills in economic work and in cultural and educational work. Especially regarding economic work, in December 1942, Comrade Mao Zedong seriously warned us in his book "Economic Problems and Financial Problems": "We should not only be able to handle politics, handle military affairs, handle party affairs, and handle culture, but we should also be able to handle the economy. If we can do everything, but are incompetent in economics, then we are a bunch of useless people, and we will be overthrown by the enemy and fall into destruction." On May 22, 1943, at a banquet for employee representatives, Comrade Mao Zedong said again: "The people support the Communist Party because we represent the demands of the nation and the people, but if we cannot solve economic problems, if we cannot establish new-style industries, if we cannot develop the productive forces, the people may not support us." "If we Communists do not care about industry, do not care about the economy, and do not understand any other beneficial work, and know nothing and are incapable of anything about these, and only do a kind of abstract 'revolutionary work', such revolutionaries are worthless. We should oppose these empty-headed revolutionaries and learn all kinds of technical knowledge to industrialize China." Comrade Mao Zedong said these words many years ago. Now, the people are even more urgently in need of our skills in these areas. In the past, because of the conditions, our skills in these areas were not so good, but there was no particularly obvious danger. However, now it is different. Now we already possess, and will continue to possess, large cities and industrial areas. We will possess the whole country, especially most of the liberated areas have eliminated feudalism, and the new democratic national economy with socialist elements - that is, state-owned enterprises with socialist elements - is increasing day by day, and will increasingly enhance its leading role in the economy (although its economic weight today is still very small). If we - the Communist Party members who are the heads of the people - do not make special efforts to learn, and truly learn economic work and cultural and educational work (especially economic work), then even if we win a complete military victory nationwide, we may still not be able to compete with others economically, and we may still become "a bunch of useless people, and we will be overthrown by the enemy and fall into destruction."

In March of this year, Ta Kung Pao published a newsletter, a contribution from an engineer from Anshan. It severely criticized us in very impolite terms. Among them, there were a few sentences that said: "... They (referring to us Communists) are familiar with and have a good way of dealing with the countryside. They are obviously very unfamiliar with cities, especially industrial cities. They are still very short of talent, but the Communist authorities in Anshan do not know how to collect talent..." Everyone knows: Ta Kung Pao is a pro-Kuomintang newspaper that often dislikes and opposes us. The author of the manuscript did not understand the true path of our nation. However, let's ignore these for the time being. The above few sentences are worth our attention. We are not afraid that those who oppose us have discovered our weaknesses, nor do we care whether their wording is polite or not; what we are afraid of is that we dare not face our own weaknesses and are unwilling to work hard to overcome our weaknesses. In fact, in terms of industrial cities, we are indeed "very unfamiliar". Even in rural areas, we cannot be arrogant and complacent. We also have unfamiliar things. We have many things to continue to learn. If we do not learn enough, we may still make mistakes in rural areas. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his "Speech at the Cadre Conference in Jin Sui", we have made some "leftist" mistakes in rural work.

In the face of fresh things, or in the face of unfamiliar things, whoever wants to sell some "old revolutionary qualifications" and call himself a "hero" will get beaten black and blue. This is really merciless. No matter how glorious your past history is, if you don't seek progress here, you will become a laggard.

There is nothing that can be "known at birth" and "able without learning", nor is there a time when there is enough learning. Who should we learn from? Our teachers can be found everywhere. Comrade Mao Zedong told us in 1938 when discussing learning: "... We have many teachers - workers, peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, capitalists, landlords, Japanese imperialism, and the whole world. They are all our research objects and at the same time our teachers. We should learn something from them, more or less." Comrade Mao Zedong's words still retain their full value for our work in various departments today. That is to say: we must learn from all kinds of masses, learn from allies, and even learn from enemies. Of course, Comrade Mao Zedong's meaning is not to learn indiscriminately, but to learn critically.

Because we are not good at learning in economic work, and have not learned a lot (of course, generally speaking), we have tasted a lot of suffering. Especially in the past three or four years, our revolutionary situation has expanded, economic matters have become more numerous and complex, and our progress has been insufficient. Some have even blindly applied old, narrow experiences, and we have tasted more suffering and suffered greater losses. Many wealthy and good merchants, taking advantage of the scattered weaknesses of our small-scale production economy, are still trying to play the old tricks of speculation and market manipulation. Because we are kind and because we are not yet shrewd and capable in these industries, they have bullied us. Of course, those bad people hiding in the state-owned industrial or commercial institutions led by us also bully us because we are honest, thinking that we can only do politics and not economics, and treat our honesty as foolishness. Such things have even been discovered, that is, they can take our public goods out of the back door with one hand, and send these goods to the front door to sell to us with the other hand, while continuing to receive his salary from us. Because of our unfamiliarity, some of our comrades have done many absurd things in industry. No matter how many superior conditions our state-owned factories led by us have, some factories are living in a state of loss, unable to compete with private capital. So that not only the workers, but also those engineers, technicians, or employees who are indeed kind and willing to help the people's cause, have to shake their heads for us, feeling that we are still too naive in these areas.

### “重要的问题在善于学习”　介绍列宁论学习经济工作（之一）

　　“重要的问题在善于学习”
  　介绍列宁论学习经济工作（之一）
    “重要的问题在善于学习”。这是毛泽东同志在“中国革命战争的战略问题”上所写的一个题目。毛泽东同志在那里所写的是关于军事问题。从人民解放军胜利的实际看来，我们全党响应了毛泽东同志的号召，已经大体上学习了战争，虽然在这方面我们还是不能自己满足，还需要继续学习，要学习得更多，更好。除了在军事这一方面应该继续学习之外，显然，今天我们特别要提出来学习关于经济的工作与文化教育的工作。很久以来，毛泽东同志即号召我们学习这两项工作，我们过去也学习过一些，做过一些工作，并且有过创造，以至是重要的创造，因此，在许多最艰苦的年月，我们渡过了许多经济的难关，提高了群众政治的觉悟。这类成绩，是不能够磨灭的。但是，我们还应该承认：在这两方面的工作，我们仍然是极端幼稚，有时简直幼稚得可笑。这是不足怪的：第一，因为我们党绝大多数的优秀干部，二十几年来一直为军事与政治工作而奔忙，精力集中在那些方面，而不是在这些方面。当然，在经济与文化的方面，我们也有优秀的干部，但比起军事与政治的方面来是太少了。第二，因为我们执政的地区，过去大都是较偏僻的农村环境，大工业很微末，商业斗争的问题是存在了的，但是，一般说来，经济情况比起现在要简单多了。同样的，文化教育的情况也是比较简单的。因此，过去的经验是很不够用的。而且，经验总是两方面的，有正确的经验，也有错误的经验，我们许多同志没有认真去学习这种种过去的经验，也没有认真去领会毛泽东同志关于这种种经验的总结，因此，在新的环境下，一方面就可能不会利用过去的正确的经验，另方面又可能再犯过去的错误。
    我们共产党员，正如斯大林的名言：“是特种式样的人。我们是由特别材料制成的”。对于我们共产党员，是没有什么不能够学会的。绝对不是不能够学会，而是“重要的问题在善于学习”。只要我们能够遵守毛泽东同志的教训而善于学习，那末，我们也就会象在军事战线上的百战百胜一样，我们在经济战线上与在文化教育战线上仍将赢得百战百胜。
    没有任何人（连我们的敌人在内）能够怀疑我们在军事上将在全国胜利。我们在军事上将在全国胜利，彻底粉碎国民党反动派，这是早经确定的了。但是，全国人民不只是需要我们在军事上有本领，而且需要我们在经济工作上，在文化教育工作上，有同样的本领。特别关于经济工作，在一九四二年十二月，毛泽东同志在“经济问题与财政问题”一书上面，就严重地警告过我们：“我们不但应该会办政治，会办军事，会办党务，会办文化，我们也应该会办经济。如果我们样样能干，惟独对于经济无能，那我们就是一批无用之人，就要被敌人打倒，就要陷于灭亡。”一九四三年五月二十二日在欢宴职工代表会上，毛泽东同志又说：“老百姓拥护共产党，是因为我们代表了民族与人民的要求，但是，如果我们不能解决经济问题，如果我们不能建立新式工业，如果我们不能发展生产力，老百姓就不一定拥护我们。”“如果我们共产党员不关心工业，不关心经济，也不懂别的什么有益的工作，对这些一无所知，一无所能，只会做一种抽象的‘革命工作’，这种革命家是毫无价值的。我们应该反对这种空头革命家，学习使中国工业化的各种技术知识。”毛泽东同志这些话已说了好多年，到了现在，人民是更迫切地需要我们在这些方面的本领了。过去因为所处的条件，我们这些方面的本领虽然差些，也还没有特别显出迫切的危险性来，但是，现在不同了。现在我们已拥有、并且将继续拥有大城市与工业区，我们将拥有全国，特别是大部分解放区已消灭了封建，而带有社会主义成份的新民主主义国家经济——即带有社会主义成份的公营企业已日有增加，并且将日益增进其在经济上的领导作用（虽然它今天在经济上的比重还是很弱小的），如果我们——人民首脑的共产党员——还不去特别努力学习，真正学会经济工作与文化教育工作（特别是经济工作），那末，即使我们军事上在全国完全胜利了，我们也还可能在经济上竞争不过别人，也还可能变成是“一批无用之人，就要被敌人打倒，就要陷于灭亡。”
    本年三月间，大公报刊载了一篇通讯，是一个从鞍山出来的工程师的投稿，里面很严厉地批评了我们，措辞很不礼貌，其中有几句话，说是：“……对于农村，他们（按：指我们共产党人）是驾轻就熟，很有办法。对于都市，尤其一个工业城市，显然生疏得很。他们还是非常的缺乏人材，但是鞍山的共党当局却不知道收罗人材……”。大家知道：大公报是一个亲国民党而经常敌视我们、反对我们的报纸，该稿作者也没有摸清我们民族真正的出路，但是，我们暂且不管这些，上述的几句话，却是值得我们注意的。我们并不怕那反对我们的人发现了我们的弱点，也不管人家对我们的措辞礼貌不礼貌；我们所怕的，就是我们不敢正视我们自己的弱点，不肯用力去克服自己的弱点。事实上，在工业城市方面，我们固然“生疏得很”，就在农村方面，我们也不能骄傲自满，我们也有生疏的东西，我们是有许多东西要继续学习的，如果学习得还不够，我们在农村中也还可能犯错误，如毛泽东同志“在晋绥干部会议上的讲话”就指责了我们曾经在农村工作中犯了一些过“左”的错误。
    在新鲜事物面前，或在生疏的事物面前，谁要卖什么“革命老资格”，自称“英雄”，谁就要碰得皮破血流。这真是无情得很的。不管你过去的历史多末光荣，但在这里不求长进，就得成为落伍者。
    没有什么是可以“生而知之”与“不学而能”的，也没有什么是有学够的时候。向谁学习呢？我们的先生是到处可以找到的。毛泽东同志在一九三八年论学习的时候曾经告诉我们：“……我们的先生多得很——工人、农民、小资产阶级、资本家、地主、日本帝国主义，还有全世界，他们都是我们的研究对象，同时又都是我们的先生，我们应该向他们或多或少的学到一点东西。”毛泽东同志这些话对于我们今天各部门的工作仍然保存了全部的价值。就是说：我们要向各种群众学习，向同盟者学习，以至向敌人学习。当然，毛泽东同志的意思不是要囫囵吞枣的学习，而是要批判的学习。
    由于我们在经济工作上还不善于学习，还没有学习很多（当然是从一般来说），我们已尝过了不少苦头。特别是三四年来，我们革命的局面扩大了，经济的事情更多更复杂，而我们的进步不够，甚至有的就把旧的狭小的经验乱套一顿，我们的苦头也就尝得更多，吃亏更大。不少多财善贾的商人，利用我们小生产经济分散的弱点，还企图要弄投机和操纵市场的旧把戏，并且因为我们善良，因为我们对这类行业还不精明强干，他们就欺侮了我们。当然，那些躲在我们领导的公营工业或公营商业的机构内的坏人也欺侮我们老实，觉得我们只会干政治，不会干经济，就把我们的老实看成傻瓜，而甚至发现过这样的事情，即可以一手把我们的公家货物从后门运出，另一手就把这些货物送进前门来卖给我们，同时继续向我们领取他的薪水。因为我们的生疏，在工业中我们有些同志曾经做过很多荒谬绝伦的事情，不管我们领导的公营工厂有很多优越的条件，但是有些工厂却是在赔本的情况下过日子，竞争不过私人资本，以至于不但是工人，而且也使那些存心的确良善、愿意帮助人民事业发展的工程师、技师或善于管理企业的职员，也要为我们摇头，觉得我们在这些方面还太过于幼稚。
