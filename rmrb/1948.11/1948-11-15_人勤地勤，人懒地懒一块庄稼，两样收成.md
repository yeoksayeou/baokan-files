　　[Our Dispatch] In Chuankou Village, Donggouli, in the Second District of Fushan, Taiyue, there is a fertile plot of land near the river, about twenty mu in size, called "Twenty Mu Ba." During the land reform in this village three years ago, the land was divided between two families, one being the military dependent, Ren Zhongcheng, and the other, Liu Xingwang. Ren Zhongcheng is over fifty years old this year. Although he is old, he has a great work ethic and never sleeps in late. In two years, he has transformed his ten mu of dry land into paddy fields. This year, he planted five mu of indigo and harvested five hundred jin, which can be exchanged for at least twenty-five shi of wheat. He planted two mu of corn, which can yield five shi. The remaining three mu are all planted with vegetables. If he sells all the vegetables, he can buy six shi of corn. From this plot of land alone, he can harvest twenty-five shi of wheat and eleven shi of corn this year. Combined with the income from his other dozen mu of land, it is more than enough to feed his entire family of eleven. His work ethic has earned him praise from the masses. However, Liu Xingwang is different. Liu Xingwang is a young man in his twenties who is unwilling to work. He often sleeps until breakfast time. He is only interested in other women and argues with his wife all day long, talking about divorce. Two years ago, he raised two large castrated bulls, but he has now sold them and eaten all the proceeds. His family is living in great difficulty. Last winter, he sewed two old sheepskins together to wear as a cotton-padded coat. Others educated him, saying, "Work hard! Look how shabby your clothes are!" But he retorted discontentedly, "Humph, you wear cloth jackets, and I wear fur coats!" He doesn't listen to anyone's advice. This year, the ten mu of land were planted with millet and corn, but were only weeded once. The weeds grew taller than the crops. All kinds of miscellaneous grains combined will only yield five or six shi. The masses commented on the crops of these two people: "Twenty Mu Ba, each gets half, hard work makes the land fertile, laziness makes the land barren." Everyone can clearly see who they should learn from.

　　人勤地勤，人懒地懒一块庄稼，两样收成
    【本报讯】太岳浮山二区川口村东沟里，靠近河边有一块地，二十亩大，地质很肥，名叫“二十亩＠”。大前年这村进行土改，把这地分给了两家，一是军属任忠诚，一家是刘兴旺。任忠诚今年五十多岁，虽然年纪大了，但劳动精神很好，从来没睡过大天明，二年工夫，他把这十亩地由旱地改造成水田。今年这块地种蓝五亩，打蓝五百斤，至少能换二十五石麦子；种二亩玉茭能打五石，下剩的三亩地，都种成菜，如完全卖了，可籴六石玉茭，仅这块地，今年共可收麦二十五石，收玉茭十一石，连其他十几亩地，收入供全家十一口人食用，是绰绰有余。他的劳动精神，得到群众的好评。但是刘兴旺就不同了，刘兴旺是二十多岁的年青小伙子，不肯动弹，时常睡到吃早饭才起来，只看见别的女人好，成天和老婆闹离婚，前二年喂两条大犍牛，到现在都卖了，吃光了，家里过的很困难，去年冬天用两张老羊皮，缝起来当棉袄穿，别人教育他说：“好好动弹，看你穿的多稀活！”他反不满的说：“哼，你穿的布袄，我穿的皮袄。”不接受人的意见。今年这十亩地种的谷子玉茭，仅锄了一遍，草比田禾长的还高，各样杂粮合起来，只能打五、六石。群众对他这两人的庄稼，作了个评论：“二十亩＠各一半，人勤地勤，人懒地懒。”该向谁学习，大家都看的很清楚。
