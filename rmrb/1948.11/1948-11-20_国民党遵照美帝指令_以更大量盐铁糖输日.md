Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: According to various sources, the Kuomintang government is following the instructions of its American masters to supply Japan with even greater quantities of Chinese iron ore, salt, and sugar. Following the sale of the second batch of 200,000 tons of iron ore from Hainan Island to Japan in August, the Kuomintang's China Trust Bureau sold another 200,000 tons of iron ore stored in Daye, Hubei, to Japan in September. The remaining batches were shipped to the port of a company in northern Kyushu, Japan, on September 15, and others are being rushed there. The representative of the Kuomintang Resources Committee stationed in Japan stated on September 15 that the approximately 800,000 tons of iron ore stored in the Daye area "will be sold to Japan in batches." The Kuomintang government's traitorous crime of supplying Daye iron ore to Japan has aroused strong protests from the people of Hubei. In addition, the Kuomintang government is preparing to supply 500,000 tons of salt to Japan for industrial needs in the coming year. Shen Benqiang, Director of Production and Consumption of the Kuomintang Salt Administration, said in a conversation on October 20 that negotiations with the U.S. military in Japan for the sale of salt "have been successfully concluded." It is claimed that the U.S. military headquarters and the Japanese government "are making even more demands" and want the Kuomintang government "to provide a fixed supply." The Taiwan Sugar Corporation recently stated that the company plans to increase its exports of Taiwanese sugar to Japan from 65,000 tons this year to 100,000 tons next year. A Central News Agency report revealed that large quantities of Taiwanese sugar and salt are being shipped to Japan. On the 4th and 5th of this month alone, 8,500 tons of Taiwanese sugar and 15,000 tons of Taiwanese salt were shipped to Japan.

　　国民党遵照美帝指令
  　以更大量盐铁糖输日
    【新华社陕北十日电】据各方消息：国民党政府正遵照其美国主人指令，将中国的铁矿和盐、糖更大量地供应日本。继海南岛铁矿第二批廿万吨于八月间售给日本之后，国民党中信局又于九月间将湖北大冶存储之铁矿砂二十万吨卖给日本，其余分批已于九月十五日运抵日本九州北部公司港，其他正陆续赶运中。国民党资源委员会驻日本代表曾于九月十五日声明：大冶地区存储之铁矿砂约八十万吨，“将分批地售给日本”。国民党政府以大冶铁矿供应日本之卖国罪行，曾激起湖北人民之强烈抗议。此外，国民党政府并已准备于未来一年中以食盐五十万吨供应日本工业需要。国民党盐务总局生产及消费处长沈本强于十月二十日谈话中称：与驻日美部所作买卖食盐之谈判“已圆满结束”。据称：美军总部与日本政府“刻并作更多之要求”，并要国民党政府“作固定之供应”。台湾糖业公司则于最近声称：该公司已计划将输日台糖自今年的六万五千吨增为明年的十万吨。中央社消息披露：大批台糖与台盐正源源运往日本，本月四、五两日即有台糖八千五百吨及台盐一万五千吨运往日本。
