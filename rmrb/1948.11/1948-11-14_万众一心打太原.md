　　United as One to Fight Taiyuan
  　Che Min
　　I. Demands to Advance on Taiyuan
    Villagers are busy preparing stretchers, people on the road are rushing to deliver public grain, and trains are loaded with beams, sacks, door panels, and other materials, coming and going in a continuous stream. At a certain station, soldiers engaged in assault exercises are discussing: "This beam is alright, but that door panel is too thin, we need to support it with more beams underneath, so the fortifications will be more solid." Soldier Song Luanhui said anxiously: Taiyuan has to be attacked anyway, it's better to attack sooner than later. Newly arrived liberated soldiers Tian Fang, Guo Diao, and Li Ronggui were initially full of worries, feeling helpless against the outer trenches and cement bunkers. After learning how to throw grenades, blast, and perform earthwork in training, they gained confidence and methods, demanding to attack Taiyuan immediately, and guaranteeing to complete the task. All comrades in the Third Machine Gun Squad submitted a petition, requesting to set off immediately.
    II. Please Give Us Tough Tasks
    When news of the brotherly units' successful attack on the enemy in Xiaodian, a suburb of Taiyuan, reached a certain unit, the comrades couldn't wait to join the battle immediately. Some stood on the roof looking in the direction of the artillery fire, grumbling: "Why are they treating us as a reserve force!" The battle request was put together by the soldiers, with each person adding a sentence or two, and it was sent from the squad to the platoon, company, battalion, and finally to the regimental committee. Wang Dianlong's squad of ten people, including six comrades who had fought in the Linfen campaign and had experience in assault, wanted to take on an entire enemy platoon. In the guarantee letter that branch members Li Yanjin and Yang Denglin sent to the regimental committee, they emphasized: "Attack, hold, find ways to overcome all difficulties, and successfully complete the glorious task assigned by the Party." Company Commander Liu Jinshan and Deputy Instructor Guo Gaoyu requested their superiors to give their company a "tough" task, to participate in the Taiyuan campaign and "gnaw on bones." Battalion Commander Li Guangfu firmly stated to the regimental committee: "In any difficult environment, we will guarantee to complete every task, big or small, assigned by the Party. In the glorious Taiyuan campaign, we request more tasks, more difficult tasks."
    III. At Least an "82" Mortar
    In the Fifth Detachment, plans have been widely made by individuals, groups, squads, platoons, companies… These plans have several differences from the past. The plans of individuals, groups, and squads are generally larger, with one person aiming to capture five prisoners and seize five guns. A certain squad wants to capture two cannons. Someone asked, "Aren't your plans a bit too high?" Soldiers Liu Shengxiu and Wang Peiming explained, "We captured Linfen, and annihilated the elite, personally trained division of Yan, so we have plenty of experience. When fighting Yan's troops, as long as you are brave and charge forward, the enemy will run like sheep." Squad Leader Zhang Yougui said, "When attacking the personally trained division, only six people in our squad captured three mountain guns." In the Third Company, there was also a lot of discussion: Yan Xishan doesn't have 60mm mortars, and a 50mm small gun doesn't count as a gun. When talking about guns, it should be at least an 82mm mortar. Some are aiming for one, two, or three mountain guns. In the past, planning focused on assault, but this time, no matter what task is given, whether it's scaling the city walls or gnawing on bones on the periphery, we will resolutely complete it. In completing the task, we must overcome any difficulties and test the tenacity of our troops. Not only will we fight well and maintain good policy and discipline, but we will also strive to join the Chinese Communist Party in this campaign. In the Fifth Detachment's machine gun company, there are eleven comrades including Xing Laijie, and in the Sixth Detachment's special service company, there are thirty-one comrades who have made this request.
    IV. After the Task of Scaling the City Walls Was Relayed to the Troops
    On the ninth, the task of scaling the city walls was relayed to the Sixth Detachment. Special-class Meritorious Hero Shen Yongliang immediately wrote a quick-rhythm verse, praising the glory of receiving the task. First Battalion Commander Li Zuojun and Instructor Li Fengqi immediately submitted a request to the regimental committee, asking to give them the task of the scaling assault battalion at all costs. Fourth Detachment's Second Battalion Commander Liu Yaohu and Instructor Pan Fang submitted their first letter to the regimental committee, and the regimental committee's reply was to see who had the best training results, the strongest morale, and the most confidence, and then give it to them. Commander Liu and Instructor Pan immediately sent a second guarantee letter, emphasizing the sharpening-the-knife tactics, cherishing soldiers, being brave and tenacious, not fearing any difficulties, and combining firepower, blasting, and assault, launching fierce attacks and rapid advances, and expanding the breakthrough. If the enemy counterattacks, we will resolutely fight back, successfully complete the task, and ensure a big victory, small casualties, and no silent battles. And strictly implement the Party's various policies and disciplines.
    V. Plant the Flag of the Linfen Brigade on Taiyuan City
    Political Commissar Xiao gave a speech at a meeting of officers above the platoon level, and the brigade committee then issued a call: carry forward the old tradition of heroism and tenacity, fight well, maintain good discipline and policy, take Taiyuan, and liberate all the people of Shanxi. Plant the glorious flag of the Linfen Brigade on Taiyuan City. This call, transmitted to the troops, was deeply imprinted in the hearts of the soldiers. All party members of the Sixth Detachment's first branch studied the call, conducted in-depth discussions and deliberations, and wrote to the higher party committee, saying: his company currently has 129 people, the average throwing distance of grenades is 35 meters per person, ×× people are proficient in earthwork and transforming enemy fortifications, the shooting skills of machine gunners are ××, within 200 meters ×× people can hit two out of three shots. There are × small artillerymen, × people can hit two out of three shots at 50 meters with direct fire, and can hit two out of three shots at 300 meters with curved fire. There are ×× riflemen, of which ×× can hit two out of three shots at 100 meters. There are ××× combat soldiers with blasting skills, and ×× can perform ignition, forced continuous solo blasting, etc. Among these ××× combatants, ×× have scaled city walls before. With these guarantees, they respectfully ask the party committee and leaders at all levels to confidently give them this glorious and great task.

### 万众一心打太原

　　万众一心打太原
  　车敏
　　一、要求向太原进军
    村里人忙着搞担架，路上的人赶送公粮，火车上满载梁条、麻袋、门板等物，络绎于途。在某车站上进行攻坚演习的健儿们，纷纷议论着：“这根梁条还可以，那块门板太薄，下面得多撑几根梁条，工事才会修得更加结实些。”战士宋銮会着急的说：太原反正要打，迟打不如早打好。解放战士田芳、郭调、李荣贵刚来时，满脑袋顾虑，觉得对于外壕、洋灰堡没办法。练兵中他学会了投弹爆破土工作业后，有了信心与办法，要求立刻打太原，保证完成任务。机枪三班全体同志递了呈请书，请求即刻出征。
    二、请上级给我们硬任务
    兄弟部队开始向太原城郊小店的敌人进攻，胜利消息传到某部来，同志们恨不得马上投入战斗。有的站到房顶向打炮的方向张望，咕哝着：“为什么把我们当做预备队！”作战请求书由战士们你一言他一语的凑成了，从班里送到排里、连里、营里，一直到团委会。王殿龙班共十个人，其中六个同志打过临汾，有攻坚经验，要包打敌人一个排。一支部李堰金、杨登林送给团委的保证书上着重提出：“打上去，保守住，想办法排除一切困难，圆满完成党所给予的光荣任务。”连长刘金山、副指导员郭高玉同志要求上级给他连“硬”任务，参加太原战役，“啃骨头。”营长李光福同志向团委坚决表示：“在任何困难环境下，都会保证完成党给予的每个大小任务。在光荣的太原战役中，要求多给任务，多给困难的任务。
    三、起码也是“八二”以上的炮
    在五分队，个人、小组、班、排、连……已普遍订了计划。这些计划和以往有好些不同的地方。个人、小组和班的计划都普遍的大，一个人要捉五个俘虏，缴五支枪。某班要缴两门炮。有人问：“你们的计划有些高了吧？”战士刘生秀、王培明解释说：“我们攻占过临汾，又歼灭过阎匪精锐亲训师，有的是经验，和阎匪们打仗，只要勇敢，扑上去，敌人就放了羊。”班长张有贵说：“打亲训师我们班才六个人就缴了三门山炮。”三连里边也是纷纷议论：阎锡山没有六零炮，五零小炮算不上个炮，提到炮，起码也是八二迫击炮以上的。有的一订就是山炮一门两门或三门。以往订计划多要求突击，这次订计划不论给什么任务，登城、外围啃骨头都坚决完成。在完成任务中，要排除任何困难，考验我们部队的顽强性。不仅打好仗，搞好政策纪律，还要争取在这次战役中争取加入中国共产党。五分队的机枪连就有邢来杰等十一个同志，六分队一个特务连三十一个同志都这样请求。
    四、登城任务传到了部队以后
    九号这一天，登城的任务传到了六分队。特等功臣申永亮马上提笔写快板，歌唱领取任务的光荣。一营营长李佐军、教导员李凤岐立即把请求书递到团委会，要求把登城突击营的任务千万给了他们。四分队二营长刘瑶琥、教导员潘放，第一次上书团委会，团委的答复看谁练兵成绩大，士气旺，有把握，就给谁。刘营长和潘教导员马上就又送去了第二封保证书，强调做到磨快刀战术，爱兵，英勇顽强不怕任何困难，做好火力、爆破、突击相结合，猛打猛冲猛进，扩大突破口。如敌人反扑，坚决打下去，胜利完成任务，一定做到胜利大，伤亡小，不打哑巴仗。并严格执行党的各种政策和纪律。
    五、把临汾旅的旗帜插到太原城上
    萧政委在排以上干部会上作了讲话，旅委又接着发出了号召：发扬英勇顽强的老传统，打好仗，搞好纪律政策，打下太原，解放全山西人民。把光荣的临汾旅的旗帜插到太原城上。这一号召传至部队里，便深印在战士们的心里。六分队一支部全体党员研究了号召，作了深入的讨论酝酿，上书上级党委说：他连现有人数一百二十九，投弹平均每人三十五米，会土工作业和改造敌人工事的有××人，射击技术机枪兵××名，二百米以内有××人可以三枪中二。小炮兵×名，有×个人五十公尺平射是三弹中二，三百公尺内曲射能三弹中二。步枪兵××名，内有××名在一百公尺可以三弹中二。爆破技术战斗兵×××人，有××名拉火、点火、强行连续单兵爆破等都会。这×××个战斗员中间，有××个人登过城。他们以这些保证，敬请党委会及各级首长把这次光荣伟大的任务，放心给了自己。
