　　Chiang Bandit Troops, Fearing Annihilation, Flee Northward
  　Our Army Liberates Baoding
    [Urgent Dispatch from the Pingbao Front, 22nd of this month] The bandit troops of the 101st Army, 272nd Division (formerly the 32nd Provisional Division of the New 2nd Army under Liu Huanan), and the 36th Regiment of the Hebei Security Forces, etc., besieged in Baoding, fearing annihilation, scurried northward along the Pingbao Railway at 4:00 AM today (the 22nd). Our army entered the city at 10:00 AM. More than 100,000 citizens of the city, who had suffered the ravages of Japanese puppets and Kuomintang bandit troops for more than ten years, have now been reborn.
    Note: Baoding is the capital of Hebei Province, forming an isosceles triangle with Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin). It is known as the gateway to Pingjin and is a vital military stronghold. The Pinghan Railway connects to Beiping (Beijing) in the north, and the Fu River runs northeast through the Daqing River to Tianjin. Highways radiate in all directions, providing convenient transportation. Since the beginning of the People's Revolutionary War, Baoding has become the most important military base and troop deployment area for the Chiang bandits in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, with the establishment of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters, headed by Sun Lianzhong. After repeated defeats, Sun's bandit troops were forced to withdraw from the Baoding Pacification Headquarters, and the puppet provincial government also fled with its tail between its legs. After our army bisected the Pingbao Line, Baoding became an isolated island, completely surrounded by our forces. The city has a population of over 100,000, with a developed education system, being the second largest school district in Hebei after Pingjin. Before the "July 7th Incident," there were more than ten institutions of higher learning, including the Agricultural College and Medical College of Hebei University, as well as middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools. Currently, there are fourteen public and private secondary schools and above, with more than 3,000 students. There are also newspapers and radio stations. Commerce is flourishing, surpassing all cities in central Hebei, and it serves as a distribution center for the exchange of goods between the western Hebei mountains and the central Hebei plain. The Chiang bandits have established the Northern Hebei Electric Power Company in the city. Private enterprises include Qianyi Flour Company and Qingxing Egg Factory, which are large in scale.

　　蒋匪惧歼北逃
  　我军解放保定
    【本报平保前线二十二日急电】困守保定之匪一○一军二七二师（即原新二军暂三十二师刘化南部）及河北保安第三十六团等部，慑于被歼，于今日（二十二日）晨四时，沿平保铁路向北狼狈窜去，我军于上午十时进入城内，惨遭日伪及国民党匪军先后蹂躏达十余年之该城十余万市民，于兹遂获新生。
    按：保定为河北省会，与平津成一等腰三角形，向称平津门户，军事重镇。平汉路北接北平，府河经大清河东北通天津，公路四通八达，交通便捷。人民革命战争开始，保定即成为蒋匪在平汉北段最主要的军事基地和屯兵场，设保定绥署，以孙连仲为主任。孙匪连战连败，保定绥署被迫撤销，伪省府亦夹尾而逃。我军腰斩平保线后，保定乃成孤岛，被我团团包围。市内人口十余万，教育发达，为河北仅次于平津的学校区。“七七事变”前有河北大学农学院、医学院及中学、师范、职业学校十余所。现有公私立中等以上学校十四处，学生三千余。另有报纸、广播电台等。商业繁盛，冠冀中各城，为冀西山地与冀中平原物资交流集散地。蒋匪在该城设有冀北电力公司。私营企业有谦益面粉公司、庆兴蛋厂等，规模甚大。
