Jinzhong First District Plans Winter Production
　　Strengthens Industrial and Mining Construction

　　[Jinzhong News] In order to strengthen the industrial and mining construction in the district, the Jinzhong First District has formulated a winter production plan. The district's main industries and mines include iron industry, iron ore, coal mines, sulfur, magnetic industry, sand goods industry, salt industry, paper industry, black reef factory, gunpowder, textile industry, felt industry, saltpeter factory, workshops, and other sixteen types. Among them, coal and iron are the largest, totaling 1,628, with 12,125 workers, accounting for more than 72% of the total number of industrial and mining workers. Due to some deviations and errors in the past in implementing industrial and commercial policies, which affected the masses' bold investment in long-term construction, coupled with the recent intense and busy support for the Taiyuan campaign, the current recovery and development of industry and mining has been somewhat limited. The Commissioner's Office, based on the characteristics of the district, has decided to vigorously develop industry and mining this winter and has formulated a specific plan:

　　1. Recovery and development of the coal industry: The leadership focuses on the new districts (Yangqu, Shouyang). In Wutai, in addition to strengthening the leadership of existing coal kilns, new coal mines will be developed in a planned manner, and coke plants will be reorganized and expanded. Adapting to the current new sales situation (Xin County, Dingxiang), special attention should be paid to the organization of transportation. In Yu County, the leadership of the three public-private joint venture machine coal mines will be strengthened. In Pingding, the leadership of the existing 156 coal mines will be strengthened. In Shouyang, in addition to restoring coal kilns, small coal mines will be vigorously developed, and the Huangdangou coal mine will be investigated and surveyed to prepare for large-scale development. 2. Production of raw and wrought iron industry: In preparation for the needs of agricultural tools next year, the masses will be called upon and organized to restore and develop private operations. The center of Yu County is to restore the hoe industry. In addition to rectifying the five hoe furnaces, there should be a planned expansion. Study technology to overcome guildism, transform finished products, and manufacture Sichuan and Guangdong goods. Help the masses take over the Dongcun sand casting factory and plan to lend 150 shi of grain. Pingding will improve the indigenous iron pot furnace to develop towards sand casting. Organize mass funds to develop foreign iron bars, tinplate, strips, plowshares, and other iron furnaces. In the third and fourth districts of Yangqu, the number of raw and wrought iron furnaces will be developed from ten to twenty as a foundation. 3. Magnetic and sand goods industry: Organize the masses to raise funds according to sales conditions. For example, Pingding must strengthen the leadership of the Shijiazhuang transit station. 4. Sulfur and saltpeter industry: Wutai produces ×10,000 catties per day. The output of saltpeter in Yu County, Pingding, and Yangqu is also not small. All localities should pay attention to studying sales channels and considering development, and overcome blindness. 5. Cotton and wool textile industry: The focus should be on the Yang disaster area, and Xin County and Yangqu should restore and develop under certain conditions. Wutai woolen weaving will further promote hand looms, and organize the production of wool pockets in the area of the fourth district. Yu County will strengthen the leadership of the existing four felt hat houses. 6. Various production workshops: In addition to wineries, various workshops can be restored in large quantities. Yu County, Shouyang, and Yangqu will organize the masses to invest privately to restore oil mills. Xin County and Dingxiang will organize the development of flour mills combined with pig raising. Dingxiang will develop the paper industry, and Pingding will develop the water mill industry.

　　In order to organize the transportation and sales of products and promote production development, the bank will provide short-term loans to stimulate private capital expansion, widely organize mass transportation and sales, promote the development of hand-pushed carts, rubber-tired vehicles, and road repairs, etc.
