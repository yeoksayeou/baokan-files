Xinhua News Agency, North China, 22nd. The "Inquiry Office" column established by the Jizhong Guide has proven to be an important method of strengthening the connection between the Party newspaper and the masses. The newspaper specially opened this column in September of this year to answer various questions raised by cadres and the masses. It has been welcomed by the majority of readers in the past two months. The newspaper office receives fifty or sixty questions every day, and some farmers come from far away to make friends with the editors of the "Inquiry Office." Among the questions received in the past two months, the most frequent questions are about land reform and Party rectification policies. Most of the questions asked by the masses are "the government's attitude towards these issues," while cadres ask more about how to deal with certain policy issues. The second most frequent questions are about marriage, industry and commerce, rural sideline occupations, war service burdens, diseases, terms (mostly asked by elementary school teachers), and agricultural knowledge. In order to answer the questions accurately and appropriately, the newspaper office has established close ties with Party, government, and military organs, as well as hospitals and farms. Many questions are forwarded to them for answers or public opinions. For some rural work issues, the newspaper is unable to answer directly due to a lack of understanding of the situation, so it entrusts the relevant county committees to investigate and answer them, and deals with them individually or publishes them publicly. At the joint meeting of county secretaries held by the Jizhong District Committee of the Communist Party of China, the county secretaries all believed that the "Inquiry Office" had a great effect. Many people read the "Inquiry Office" before reading the news. Many district cadres in Raoyang and Anguo copied the answers in the "Inquiry Office" into small notebooks. An old traditional Chinese medicine doctor in Anping cut out and pasted the "Inquiry Office" issues published since its inception into a notebook, and used it to answer the people's doubts at any time, so he became the local farmers' "Inquiry Office." The newspaper has set up a special section in the editorial department to be responsible for the work of the "Inquiry Office" column. In the past, the newspaper devoted a quarter of a page to the "Inquiry Office" every day, and now it plans to double it. (Editor's note: The experience of the "Inquiry Office" of the Jizhong Guide is worth learning from by Party newspapers in various places. And we should constantly create more methods to strengthen the connection between the Party newspaper and the masses.)

　　冀中导报“问事处”受到广大读者欢迎
    【新华社华北二十二日电】冀中导报所设立的“问事处”栏，已证明是加强党报与群众联系的重要方法之一。该报在今年九月特辟此栏，专门解答干部、群众提出的各种问题。两个月来得到广大读者的欢迎。每天报馆可收到问题五、六十个，有些农民老远的跑来和“问事处”的编辑交朋友。在过去两个月来所收到的问题中，最多的问题是关于土改及整党政策的，群众所问的，大半是“政府对这些问题的态度”，干部多问对某些政策问题的处理方法。其次是婚姻、工商业及农村副业、战勤负担、疾病、名词（大多为小学教员问）、农业常识等问题。报馆为了把问题答复得确实中肯，乃和党、政、军机关及医院、农场等取得密切联系，许多问题均转请他们解答，或公开发表意见。对于有些农村工作问题，报纸因不了解情况，无法直接答复，即委托有关地区的县委调查解答，个别处理或公开发表。在中共冀中区党委召开的县书联席会上，县委书记们都认为“问事处”作用很大。许多人看报先看“问事处”，后看新闻。饶阳、安国许多区干部，把“问事处”里解答的问题抄在小本子上。安平有一个老中医，把出版以来的“问事处”剪贴成一个本子，随时据以解答群众的疑难，于是他就成了当地农民的“问事处”。该报在编辑部内专设一科，负责“问事处”栏的工作。过去该报每天以一版的四分之一为“问事处”的地位，今后拟扩大一倍。（编者按：冀中导报“问事处”的经验，值得各地党报学习。并且应当不断创造更多方法以加强党报对群众的联系。）
