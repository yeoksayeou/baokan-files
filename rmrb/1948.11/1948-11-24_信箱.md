　　Mailbox
　　Zhao Shumin of Huolu, and Shimin from the Communist Youth League School:

　　Your letters suggesting “Printing methods to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit banknotes” and “Repairing the wooden bridge for river management” have been forwarded to the North China Bank and the Ping Shan Construction Section respectively.

　　Han Taiyan of Linxian:

　　Regarding the restriction of large vehicles on the main street of Hejian Town, your letter did not explain the reason. We are not aware of the situation and have forwarded it to the local government of Hejian for investigation and handling.

　　Liu Luolian of Xiguan, Wuji:

　　According to your letter: Your family of four originally had six mu of land. You cultivated a piece of wasteland that had been abandoned for two hundred years through your own labor, bringing the total to fourteen and a half mu. You later sold two and a half mu to buy a small donkey. There is no exploitation, and your class status should be middle peasant. It was wrong to confiscate part of your land, house, and donkey during the land reform. Appropriate compensation should be given now.

　　Zhang Shumei, Production Section, North Yue Military Region:

　　Please provide your detailed address and specify which production section you are in, so that your money can be returned.

　　Sun Shaoying and others from the North China × Corps:

　　You hope that some of the North China literary and art workers will go to the front lines to serve the soldiers. Your opinions have been forwarded to the North China Literary Association for their consideration.

　　Shang Shihhao of Shahe:

　　It is wrong to confiscate the six hundred jin of rice saved from the salary of an elementary school teacher during the anti-feudal struggle. It should be returned appropriately.
