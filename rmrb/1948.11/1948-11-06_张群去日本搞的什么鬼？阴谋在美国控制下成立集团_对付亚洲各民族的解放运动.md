Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st. TASS Paris, 23rd: The newspaper "Action" published a special article by its New York correspondent entitled "Why is Zhang Qun going to Japan?" The article pointed out that at the beginning of this year, the US State Department instructed the Director of the Policy Planning Office of the Academy, Kennan, to study the issue of establishing a group of Far Eastern countries under US control to deal with the national liberation movements in Asia. After the Policy Planning Office studied this issue, Kennan went to Tokyo to begin direct negotiations with Japanese leaders who enthusiastically endorsed the US plan. The newspaper stated that after Kennan returned to the United States, he took steps to implement this plan. The future members of the group—including China and Japan—have begun negotiations. Chiang Kai-shek originally intended to go to Japan himself, but the complex political and military situation in China prevented him from doing so. Therefore, this task was entrusted to former Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun, who has many personal relationships in the Japanese industrial and military circles. Zhang Qun has held talks with many Japanese official and non-official political leaders. The newspaper continued that the results of these negotiations determined the establishment of a Far Eastern anti-communist group (including China and Japan) under the following conditions: the signatory countries of the treaty should establish a group under the guidance of the United States to ensure their political, economic, and military cooperation; the countries participating in the group should coordinate their measures to deal with left-wing parties and democratic groups, and should make every effort to fight against the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Indonesian Republic Army, the Philippine guerrillas, and the Vietnamese People's Army; Japan should send military experts to China; the contracting states should regularly exchange information on the "anti-government" activities of left-wing groups, and should coordinate their intelligence activities with each other in accordance with the recommendations of the US State Department. The newspaper concluded by saying that the representatives of China and Japan have decided to negotiate as soon as possible with other countries that have been invited to participate in the Far Eastern Group, including South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines.

　　张群去日本搞的什么鬼？
    阴谋在美国控制下成立集团
  　对付亚洲各民族的解放运动
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】塔斯社巴黎二十三日讯：行动报刊载该报驻纽约记者所撰题为“张群为什么赴日本”的专文。该文指出，在本年初，美国国务院曾指令该院政策计划处处长凯南研究关于在美国控制下成立远东国家集团借以对付亚洲民族解放运动的问题，计划处研究这一问题以后，凯南就到东京开始与热烈赞同美国计划的日本领袖直接谈判。该报称，凯南返回美国之后，就采取步骤执行此一计划。该集团的未来成员——包括中国及日本在内——已开始谈判。蒋介石本拟亲赴日本，但中国国内复杂的政治及军事情况却使他不能成行。于是，这一任务就委托给前行政院长张群，张群在日本产业界及军界中有很多个人关系。张群曾与很多日本官方及非官方政界领袖会谈。该报继称，这些谈判的结果，决定按照下列条件成立远东国家反共集团（包括中国及日本在内）：该条约的签字国应在美国指导下成立集团，以保证其政治、经济及军事合作；参加该集团的国家，应相互配合其用以对付左翼政党及民主团体的措施，并应对中国人民解放军、印尼共和国军队、菲律宾游击队及越南人民军进行全力斗争；日本应派遣军事专家赴中国；缔约国应定期交换关于左翼团体“反政府”活动的情报，并依照美国国务院的建议，相互配合其谍报活动。该报末称，中日双方代表曾决定从速与其他被邀请以参加远东集团的国家谈判，这些国家包括南朝鲜、越南、泰国及菲律宾。
