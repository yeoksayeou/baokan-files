　　Our Army Pursues and Captures
　　Part of the Fleeing Enemy from Baoding
    [Baoding Telegraph] When the defending enemy of Baoding, Chiang bandit's 101st Army, 272nd Division, and the puppet Hebei Provincial Security 9th Regiment fled north, a part of them was annihilated by our North China People's Liberation Army. The fleeing remnant was extremely panicked. Fu bandit dispatched the 16th Army, 22nd Division, 109th Division, 35th Army, 101st Division, Provisional 17th Division, 26th Division, 94th Army, 43rd Division, and 101st Army, 273rd Division, to reinforce them, so they could flee north in a sorry state. The People's Liberation Army is pursuing them, and has captured a part of the fleeing enemy. Detailed battle results are being investigated.
