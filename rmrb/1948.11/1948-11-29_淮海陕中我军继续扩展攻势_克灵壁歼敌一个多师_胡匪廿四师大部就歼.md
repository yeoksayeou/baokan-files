Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 27th: The People's Liberation Army on the southern front of Xuzhou continued to develop its offensive, recovering the city of Lingbi, 120 li east of Su County, at 8:00 AM yesterday. The defending enemy, the 238th Division Headquarters of the 12th Army, along with its 61st Regiment, 62nd Regiment, a new recruit regiment, and the puppet Lingbi Security Brigade, were completely annihilated. The results of the battle are currently being tallied. Note: This division was originally designated as the New 21st Brigade. It was rebuilt after being annihilated in the Suiqi Battle in July of this year. It was recently renamed as a division and placed under the jurisdiction of the 12th Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Shaanxi Front, 27th: A unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, expanding its winter offensive, encircled and cut off Hu bandit’s 76th Army, which was attempting to reinforce the west, on both the east and west banks of the Luo River between Pucheng and Dali on the 25th, achieving a great victory. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, our army launched an attack on the 24th Division of Hu bandit’s 76th Army on the west bank of the Luo River, more than 40 li east of Pucheng. After two hours of fighting, the enemy bridgehead positions on the west bank of the Luo River, including Potou, Majiayao, Dongxinzhuang, Dongxi Chencun, Caocun, and Shiyang, were completely cleared, inflicting a devastating blow on the division. The results of the battle are still being tallied. Our army, launching an attack on the east bank of the Luo River, has successively captured important positions such as Lingao, Dongxi Fenglou, Liangjiapo, and Liujiagou, 18 li south of Chengcheng. The defending enemy collapsed at the first touch. The enemy at Yongfeng has been isolated. Thus, the enemy attempting to reinforce the west from the east of the Luo River was cut off at the waist by our forces. So far, our army's winter offensive has annihilated three divisions of Hu bandit’s (namely the 144th Division, the 17th Division, and most of the 24th Division).

Xinhua News Agency, Central Shaanxi Front, 27th: In the battle to annihilate Hu bandit’s 17th Division on the 22nd, Wang Zuodong, the commander of the enemy's 17th Division, who was captured by the People's Liberation Army, died that night due to serious injuries that could not be treated. The People's Liberation Army has buried his body in Caotan, about 50 li east of Yaoxian, with a marker erected, and has notified his family through the Shaanxi North Xinhua Radio Station to claim the body.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 26th: When the headquarters of the 100th Army of Huang Baitao's Corps was annihilated on the 15th, its Major General Deputy Commander Yang Shiyun (the previous report mistakenly identified him as Commander Zhou Zhidao) and Chief of Staff Cui Guangsen were captured alive. A front-line reporter reported the process of Yang Shiyun's capture, saying: On the evening of the 14th, a unit of the People's Liberation Army fiercely attacked Pengzhuang (west of Nianzhuangxu), where the headquarters of the enemy's 100th Army was located. After a night of fierce fighting, the next morning, the annihilated enemy fled in panic to Huangtan, to the northeast. The People's Liberation Army immediately launched a heroic attack, blocking the front and pursuing from behind. Xu Yunhai, the squad leader of the third squad of the sixth company of a certain regiment, led a combat team into the fleeing enemy ranks and caught up with a fat man wearing glasses. The fat man knelt down on both knees and covered his head with his hands on the ground. Squad Leader Xu said to him: "The People's Liberation Army treats prisoners kindly, don't be afraid, get up and come with me!" Hearing this, the fat man slowly got up, but then ran towards the northeast again. At this time, Squad Leader Xu raised his gun and shouted, "I'll shoot if you run again!" The fat man stopped and said timidly, "Comrade, don't shoot, don't shoot." Then, he knelt down on both knees again, covering his head with his hands on the ground. When Squad Leader Xu told him to get up, he slowly got up again and followed. Along the way, he knelt and got up four or five times in the same way. When he arrived at the political office of a certain regiment, our political director asked him what rank he held. He lowered his head and said, "Secretary-General." When a document "Presented to Deputy Commander Yang" was taken from him, he nodded and admitted, "I am Yang Shiyun."

　　淮海陕中我军继续扩展攻势
    克灵壁歼敌一个多师  胡匪廿四师大部就歼
    【新华社淮海前线二十七日电】徐州南线解放军继续发展攻势，于昨晨八时收复宿县以东一百二十里之灵壁县城，守敌第十二军二三八师师直及所属之六十一团六十二团及一个新兵团与伪灵壁保安队等全部就歼，战果正清查中。按：该师原番号为新二十一旅，于今年七月睢＠战役中被歼后重建，最近始改成师的番号，并改辖十二军建制。
    【新华社陕中前线二十七日电】扩展冬季攻势中的西北人民解放军一部，于二十五日在蒲城、大荔间洛河东西两岸，包围切断企图西援之胡匪七十六军，获得巨大战果。该日下午四时我军向蒲城东四十余里洛河西岸之敌七十六军二十四师发起进击，经两小时战斗，将胡匪洛河西岸的坡头、马家窑、东辛庄、东西陈村、曹村、石羊等桥头阵地完全扫清，予该师以歼灭性打击，战果正在清查中。在洛河东岸展开进击之我军，已连续攻克澄城正南十八里永丰镇以东的临高、东西凤楼、梁家坡、刘家沟等重要阵地，守敌一触即溃，永丰敌已陷孤立。至此，由洛东企图西援之敌即被我拦腰斩断。我军冬季攻势至此已歼灭胡匪三个师（即一四四师、十七师、二十四师之大部）。
    【新华社陕中前线二十七日电】在二十二日歼灭胡匪十七师之战斗中，为解放军俘获之敌十七师师长王作栋因伤重无法救治，于当晚毙命。解放军已将其尸体埋葬于耀县东约五十余里之草滩，上立标记、并经陕北新华广播电台通知其家属前去领尸。
    【新华社淮海前线二十六日电】黄伯韬兵团的一百军军部在十五日被歼时，其少将副军长杨诗云（按前报误为军长周志道）及参谋长崔广森均被生俘。前线记者报导杨诗云被俘经过称：十四日晚，解放军某部猛攻敌一百军军部所在地彭庄（碾庄圩西）。经过一夜激战，第二天早晨，歼敌慌乱地朝东北方向的前后黄滩逃窜。解放军当即英勇出击，前拦后追。某团六连三班长许云海，带着一个战斗小组冲到了溃乱的敌众里，追上了一个戴眼镜的大胖子。大胖子双膝一跪，两手抱着头伏在地上。许班长对他说：“解放军宽待俘虏，不要害怕，快起来跟我走！”听了这句话，那大胖子便慢慢地爬起来，但随后又向着东北跑。这时，许班长举着枪喊道：“再跑就打枪！”大胖子才停下来，胆怯地说：“同志，不要打，不要打。”接着，他还是双膝一跪，双手抱头的伏在地上。在许班长叫他起来时，他才又慢腾腾地爬起来跟着走。一路上他照样地跪了爬起四、五次。到达某团政治处时，我政治主任问他是什么官，他低着头说：“秘书长。”当从他身上拿出一份“呈副军长杨”的文件时，他才点头承认：“我是杨诗云。”
