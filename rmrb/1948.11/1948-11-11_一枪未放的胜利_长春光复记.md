　　Victory Without Firing a Shot
  　A Record of Changchun's Liberation
    Mu Qing
    Changchun has been liberated. This modern, permanent, and supposedly the best-defended city in the country, as boasted by the Kuomintang reactionary clique, a city with 100,000 enemy troops equipped with American weapons, was completely liberated by the People's Liberation Army without firing a single shot or artillery shell.

    In early October, when our army was fiercely attacking Jinzhou, the enemy forces defending Changchun thought that our main force had moved south. Under the orders of the bandit Chiang Kai-shek, they even attempted to take the opportunity to break through. The New 38th Division, their elite main force, launched a tentative attack in the direction of the Dafangshen Airport. As a result, they were battered and bruised in the face of the PLA's impregnable wall of steel. It was clear that breaking through was hopeless, and holding out was also a dead end.
    On the 15th, Jinzhou was liberated. The bandit Chiang hurriedly flew to Shenyang again, and in a panic, dropped a final ultimatum-like "handwritten order" to the defending enemy in Changchun, demanding that the New 7th Army and the 60th Army, led by Zheng Dongguo, break through immediately, otherwise they would "be severely punished by military law for disobeying orders." However, the day before, liaison personnel sent by General Zeng Zesheng, commander of the 60th Army, had already contacted our Changchun Front Army Command to discuss the uprising. At 3:00 AM on the 17th, the 60th Army's preparations for the uprising were completed. Under General Zeng Zesheng's orders, the entire army turned its guns towards the New 7th Army, and its artillery was aimed at the Changchun Garrison Headquarters.
    After all deployments were completed, General Zeng wrote a letter to Zheng Dongguo, explaining that he had led the entire army in an uprising and hoping that he would prioritize the life and safety of the hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians in Changchun and abandon resistance. At the same time, he asked Zheng to forward this letter to Chiang Kai-shek. After receiving this letter, Zheng Dongguo immediately sent three representatives, including the pseudo-mayor Shang Chuandao, to meet with Zeng Zesheng, requesting that the 60th Army not leave for the time being, so that they would have room for consideration, and all issues could be discussed at length. At that time, General Zeng replied very bluntly, saying that there was no need for lengthy discussions now. The uprising in Changchun was the urgent demand of the entire army, and for the benefit of all the people of China, no more hesitation could be allowed. This negotiation did not yield results. Throughout the 17th, both sides were on alert. All officers of the 60th Army wrote letters advising the New 7th Army's commanders at all levels to lay down their arms quickly, and most of the soldiers of the New 7th Army guarding the 60th Army gave up their guard under the other side's persuasion. That afternoon, General Zeng Zesheng brought an adjutant to our army's political department to discuss the liberation of Changchun, deciding that the 60th Army would withdraw from the city at 12:00 that night, and our army would enter the city to take over. After General Zeng returned to the city, he immediately ordered his entire army to prepare for all handover matters. At 12:00, our army entered the city as scheduled. The two armies were extremely happy to see each other, shaking hands and offering condolences, and shouting slogans. All officers and soldiers of the 60th Army were smiling, carefully handing over every bunker, fortification, warehouse, and building. The takeover was completed at 3:00 AM on the 18th, and our army took control of the eastern part of Changchun. This takeover was extremely smooth from beginning to end due to careful planning and swift and decisive action, and the city was in good order.

    At this time, there was chaos in the western part of the city, the defense zone of the New 7th Army. Obviously, the powerful People's Liberation Army had appeared on the New 7th Army's flanks and rear. With just one sudden attack, the New 7th Army would be completely annihilated. But our army did not fire a single shot, deciding to win over the New 7th Army to lay down its arms voluntarily with a magnanimous attitude, to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. This fact greatly moved the officers and soldiers of the New 7th Army, and they more clearly recognized our army's lenient policy. Under the influence of our army's great political spirit, the enemy began to surrender to the People's Liberation Army in batches, by squad, by platoon, by company, by battalion, and even by entire regiment.
    On the 18th, Changchun was extremely calm. There was not a single gunshot. There was only the sound of jeeps rushing back and forth as envoys of surrender. The front of the command post of our troops entering the city was lined with vehicles. In the morning, four representatives of the New 7th Army arrived at our army's city command post to begin negotiations for surrender. They requested that our army accept their collective surrender and not receive them piecemeal. Formal negotiations began that evening.

    At the negotiation meeting, General Jie Peiran, our army's representative, first said: "We know your sincerity in negotiating. In fact, the vast majority of your officers and soldiers are unwilling to fight anymore, especially after the liberation of Jinzhou and the uprising of the 60th Army, it is even more impossible to fight. Breaking through is even more of a fantasy. In order to reduce the losses of the people of Changchun and your unnecessary sacrifices, we warmly welcome you to lay down your arms. If we wanted to fight, we would have wiped you all out as soon as we entered the city. But we have not fired a single shot, precisely to give you a magnanimous gesture in practical action."
    After detailed discussion, the representatives of both sides finally signed the conditions. Our conditions were: "(1) The representative of the New 7th Army shall immediately issue an order to the entire army to lay down its arms after returning to the unit. (2) At 10:00 AM on October 19th, the headquarters of the New 7th Army shall send three large trucks, escorted by the army's representatives, to welcome the representatives of the People's Liberation Army to accept the surrender, and there shall be no conflicts. (3) The strongholds defended by the New 7th Army, such as the area around Datong Square, the Central Bank, the Postal and Telecommunications Administration, the Provincial Government, Xiaozifen, Lizhi Society, the High Court, the South Station, Youth Middle School, Hainan Building, and the former 'Kwantung Army Headquarters' shall be evacuated first, and the New 7th Army shall send representatives to directly welcome the People's Liberation Army troops to control the area, in order to protect the officers and soldiers of the New 7th Army and their families and the buildings. (4) Guarantee that all personnel who lay down their arms will be gathered at the designated location by 10:30 AM on October 19th. (5) The weapons, ammunition, and all military supplies that are laid down shall be gathered at a suitable location designated by the People's Liberation Army representative team. (6) All warehouses and buildings that cannot be controlled by the People's Liberation Army for the time being shall be protected by the New 7th Army, and there shall be no destruction or loss. The New 7th Army shall send representatives to hand them over to the People's Liberation Army for management. (7) The First Corps Headquarters and the radio stations and confidential codes of the New 7th Army shall be handed over unconditionally, and there shall be no destruction or private storage." After laying down their arms, the People's Liberation Army promised: to guarantee the safety of the lives of officers and soldiers below the commander of the corps and not to insult them; to provide appropriate arrangements for those who are willing to serve, and to allow those who are willing to return to their hometowns to do so; to guarantee that the personal property of the officers and soldiers who lay down their arms will not be violated, etc. It was dawn on the 19th when the representatives of both sides signed the agreement.

    At 10:00 AM on the 19th, the magnificent columns of the People's Liberation Army poured into the defense zone of the New 7th Army, and the acceptance of surrender officially began. The weather was sunny and clear that day, and there was no gunfire in the city. On the wide streets of Changchun, more than a hundred surrender vehicles sped in all directions. The People's Liberation Army conducted the takeover in an orderly manner according to the predetermined procedures. Batches of Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers and officers who laid down their arms gathered at the designated locations. In the positions of the New 7th Army, American-made firearms and ammunition were piled up in an orderly fashion everywhere. In just a few hours, the New 38th Division, known as the "Number One Army in the World" and favored by American imperialism, and all the other units of the New 7th Army, along with all the American equipment and American-aided military supplies, were completely taken over by our heroic and mighty People's Liberation Army without firing a single shot or artillery shell. The famous city of Changchun was completely liberated.

    After his troops happily surrendered within the time stipulated by our army, Zheng Dongguo was still sitting in the Central Bank building and refused to come down. On the 20th, Zheng and his guards hid in the building, sometimes requesting that our side write "Zheng was wounded and captured" when publishing the news, and sometimes requesting permission to take a car and two horses. At 6:00 AM on the 21st, our army again ordered him to surrender. At this time, Zheng Dongguo had no choice but to lead dozens of his accompanying officers out of the Central Bank building with their heads down and their faces covered. The citizens of Changchun crowded around to watch, creating an unprecedented spectacle. This historically significant scene was completely captured by the Changchun photography team of the Northeast Film Studio. (Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th)

　　一枪未放的胜利
  　长春光复记
    穆青
    长春光复了。这个国民党反动集团所夸称的现代化的、永久性的、全国第一的设防城市，这个有着美械装备的十万守敌的城市，人民解放军未放一枪一弹，即告完全解放。
    ×　　　　×　  　　×
    十月初旬，当我军猛攻锦州时，长春守敌以为我军主力南下了，在蒋贼介石的命令下竟妄图乘机突围，以其精锐主力新三十八师向大房身机场方向作试探性出击，结果，在解放军的铜墙铁壁面前，碰得焦头烂额。显然，突围是绝望了，困守呢，也是死路一条。
    十五日，锦州解放，蒋贼又仓皇飞沈，惊慌失措地用飞机向长春守敌投下了最后通牒式的“手令”，要郑洞国率领下的新七军和六十军立即突围，否则“即以违抗命令受到严厉的军法制裁”。可是，在这前一天，六十军军长曾泽生将军派出的联络人员，就已在我长春前线兵团指挥部接洽起义了。十七日晨三时，六十军起义准备就绪，在曾泽生将军的命令下，全军的枪口都转向着新七军，大炮瞄准着长春警备司令部。
    当一切部署完毕后，曾将军即写信告知郑洞国，说明自己已率全军起义，希望他以长春数十万军民的生死安危为重，放弃抵抗。同时，叫郑将此信转告蒋介石。郑洞国接获此信后，当日即派伪市长尚传道等三人为代表面见曾泽生，要求六十军暂时不要离开，使他们有考虑的余地，一切问题可从长计议。当时曾军长回答得非常干脆，说现在已无从长计议的必要，长春起义乃是该军全体迫切的要求，为了全中国人民的利益，再不容许有任何犹豫。这一谈判未获得结果。十七日一整天，双方均处于警戒状态，六十军全体军官此时纷纷写信劝告新七军各级将领迅速放下武器，而新七军向六十军警戒之士兵，也在对方劝告下大部放弃警戒。当日下午，曾泽生将军遂带一随从副官，到达我兵团政治部，面商解放长春事宜，决定六十军于当夜十二时撤出城外，由我军入城接防。曾将军返回城中后，即通令其全军立即准备一切交防事宜。十二时，我军如时进城，两军相见极为欢洽，互相握手慰问，呼喊口号。六十军全体官兵无不面带欢笑，将每一地堡、工事、仓库、建筑等妥为交代。十八日晨三时接防完毕，我军遂控制长春城内东部地区。这一接防，因事前计议周密，行动迅速果决，自始至终极为顺利，市内秩序井然。

    这时，在城西部新七军防区内一片慌乱。显然的，强大的解放军已出现在新七军的侧后了，只消一个突袭，新七军就会全军覆灭。但我军却一枪未放，决定以宽大的态度，争取新七军自动放下武器，免作无谓的牺牲。这一事实使新七军官兵大受感动，更清楚地认识了我军的宽大政策。在我军这一伟大的政治气魄感召下，敌人开始一批一批地，一班、一排地，整连、整营地，甚至一个整团，自动向解放军缴械。
    十八日这天，长春市内极为平静，没有一点枪声，只有往来奔驰的投降使者的吉普车声。我入城部队指挥所门前车辆成行。上午，新七军的四个请降代表，到达我军城内指挥所，开始谈判投降。他们要求我军集体受降，不必零星接收。正式谈判于是日晚开始。
    ×　　　　×　　　  ×
    谈判会上，我军代表解沛然将军首先致词说：“我们知道你们谈判的诚意。事实上你们绝大多数官兵都不愿再打，特别在锦州解放和六十军起义以后更打不起来。突围更是幻想。为了减少长春人民的损失和你们的无谓牺牲，我们极欢迎你们放下武器的。如果我们要打，一进城就会把你们全部解决的。但我们一枪未放，正是从实际行动中给你们一个宽大的表示。”
    经过详细讨论，最后双方代表都在条件上签了字。我方的条件是“（一）新七军代表应于回部后立即下达全军放下武器之命令。（二）十月十九日上午十时，由新七军司令部派大卡车三辆，并由该军代表乘押，迎接解放军代表前往受降，不得有任何冲突。（三）新七军所部驻守之大同广场周围、中央银行、邮电管理局、省政府、孝子坟、励志社、高等法院、南站、青年中学、海南大楼、前‘关东军司令部’等据点首先撤出，并由新七军派代表直接将解放军部队迎至该地控制，以便保护新七军官兵与官兵家属及建筑物。（四）保证十月十九日上午十时三十分将全部放下武器之人员集中于指定地点。（五）将放下之武器弹药及一切军用品分别集中于由解放军代表小组指定之适当地点。（六）所有仓库及建筑物在解放军一时不能控制时由新七军保护，不得有任何破坏或损失。并由新七军派代表交解放军管理。（七）第一兵团司令部及新七军所属电台和机要密码无条件全部交出，不得有任何破坏和私存。”放下武器后，解放军则允予：保证自兵团司令官以下官兵之生命安全，不加侮辱；愿服务者予以适当处置，愿回籍者听其自便；保证放下武器官兵之个人财物不受侵犯等。双方代表签字时已是十九日的黎明了。

    十九日上午十时，雄壮之解放军行列即源源开入新七军防区，受降正式开始。是日天气晴和，全市寂无枪声，在宽阔的长春马路上，百余辆受降的汽车向四面八方飞驰，解放军有秩序地按预定程序依次进行接收。放下武器的蒋军官兵，一批又一批地向指定地点集中。在新七军的阵地上，到处是有秩序的堆着美式枪械和弹药。就这样，在短短的几个小时内，号称“天下第一军”的、向为美帝国主义所宠爱的新三十八师及其他新七军全部，连同所有美式装备和美援军用物资，便为我英勇威武的人民解放军不放一枪一弹地完全接收了。长春名城乃告完全光复。

    当他的部队在我军规定的时间内欢天喜地地缴了械之后、郑洞国还坐在中央银行大楼上不下来。二十日一整天，郑和他的卫队藏在楼上，时而要求我方在发表新闻时写“郑系负伤被俘”，时而要求允许他带汔车一辆、马两匹。二十一日晨六时，我军再命令其缴械。这时，郑洞国只得率其随从官佐数十人，从中央银行大楼低头掩面而出。长春市民拥挤围观，盛况空前。这富有历史意义的一幕，当经我东北电影制片厂长春摄影组全部摄入镜头。（新华社东北十日电）
