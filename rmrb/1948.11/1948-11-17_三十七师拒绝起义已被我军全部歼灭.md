　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 15th. When Generals Zhang Kexia and He Jifeng led the Kuomintang Third Pacification Zone to revolt, the Thirty-seventh Division headquarters, which refused to revolt and was routed, and two regiments under its command (excluding a battalion that had participated in the revolt), were completely annihilated by the People's Liberation Army at Sanbao Station, more than 20 miles south of Xuzhou, on the 14th. Sanbao Station has been occupied by us. The two fates of Feng Zhi'an's troops provide two examples for all Kuomintang troops: those who revolt are welcomed, and those who resist are eliminated.

    【新华社淮海前线十五日电】当张克侠、何基沣两将军率领国民党三绥区起义时，其中拒绝起义并被击溃的三十七师师部，及该师所属的两个团（缺已参加起义的一个营），于十四日在徐州以南二十余里三堡车站被解放军全部歼灭，三堡车站已为我占领。冯治安部队的两种命运，给一切国民党军两个榜样，起义的受欢迎，顽抗的被消灭。
