　　【Jizhong, 25th】 Democratic order is rapidly being restored in Shengfang City after its liberation. After our army and the democratic municipal government entered the city, order was well-maintained, and all shops reopened for business. Pedestrians constantly moved about the streets. Citizens welcomed the People's Liberation Army and democratic government personnel with incomparable joy. They excitedly said, "We've finally made it through!" "If the Eighth Route Army had come two days later, the Chiang bandits (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's troops, who demanded 100 young men from each 'bao' before fleeing) would have taken one hundred young men from each of our 'bao'." "We poor people won't go hungry anymore." Some small business owners said, "It will be easier to do business in the future." Some citizens spontaneously erased slogans painted on the walls by the Chiang bandits and dismantled fortifications left by the enemy. While maintaining social order, the People's Liberation Army is also mopping up scattered and hidden armed remnants of the enemy. Democratic municipal government personnel are comforting and consoling citizens and actively planning the restoration and construction of a new Shengfang. Shengfang City is located 90 li southwest of Tianjin. With a population of nearly 40,000, it is situated south of the Daqing River, with direct access to Tianjin by both land and water, making it a major commercial town west of Tianjin.

　　【Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 27th】 After the liberation of Nanyang City, a vital town in southwestern Henan, the People's Municipal Government and the City Garrison Headquarters have been successively established. Mayor Xu Guye and Garrison Commander Huang Zuhua have taken office and are actively promoting various restoration efforts. Before their chaotic escape, the Wang Lingyun bandit troops of the Kuomintang army plundered extensively and abducted over 10,000 young men from the city. Over 75% of the teachers, staff, and students in all thirteen middle schools in the city were also not spared. At that time, the streets and alleys were filled with weeping. After the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government entered the city, they immediately issued proclamations to reassure the people and formed comfort groups to carry out consolation work. Our propaganda teams entered the city with the army, distributing various proclamations and propaganda materials of our army, explaining our army's various policies and the victorious situation everywhere. Order throughout the city quickly stabilized. People have handed over ammunition and materials that the Chiang bandit army forced them to store in their homes. Due to the long-term harsh and tyrannical rule of the Kuomintang, the city is experiencing a severe grain shortage. The People's Government has specially entrusted the Nanyang branch of the Zhongzhou Farmers Bank to supply grain to the citizens at a low price. In just one day, the bank sold 100 shi (each shi being 140 jin) of food grain. Currently, shops and businesses throughout the city have reopened one after another. The various middle and primary schools, which were severely damaged by the enemy, are also actively reorganizing and restoring under the leadership of the city's Cultural and Educational Preparatory Committee.

　　【Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 27th】 The Zhengzhou Joint Management Committee of the Longhai and Pinghan Railways has been formally established. The committee has three departments: General Affairs, Transportation, and Engineering, as well as two offices: Secretariat and Personnel. The scope of railway rights management is tentatively set as the section of the Longhai Railway from Tongguan in the west to Shangqiu in the east, and the section of the Pinghan Railway from Luohe in the south to Xinxiang in the north. The People's Government has appointed Tian Yumin and Gong Peiji as the chairman and vice-chairman of the management committee.

    【冀中二十五日电】胜芳市解放后，民主秩序正迅速恢复中。我军及民主市政府入市后，市内秩序井然，各商店均开张营业。街头行人来往不断。市民们都以无比愉快的心情，欢迎解放军和民主政府工作人员。他们兴奋的说：“可熬出来啦！”“八路军再晚来两天，咱们每保的一百个青年就被那王八羔子们（指蒋匪临逃前曾向该市每保要一百个壮丁）弄走了。”“咱穷人往后就不挨饿了。”一般小商人们说：“以后做买卖方便了。”有的市民自动擦去蒋匪涂在墙上的标语，拆毁敌人遗留的工事。解放军一面维持社会秩序，一面清剿流散隐蔽的武装残匪。民主市府工作人员，正安抚慰问市民，并积极计划恢复与建设新的胜芳。按胜芳市在天津西南九十华里，全市人口将近四万，南临大清河，水陆均直达天津，为津西商业重镇。
    【新华社中原二十七日电】豫西南重镇南阳城解放后，人民市政府及市警备司令部已相继成立。市长许姑业，警备司令黄祖华已到任办公，现正积极推行各项恢复工作。国民党军王凌云匪部于狼狈逃窜前，曾大肆抢掠，并掳走该城壮丁一万余名，全城十三处中学百分之七十五以上的教、职、学员也未能幸免。当时大街小巷一片哭声。解放军及人民政府入城后，即布告安民，并组慰问组进行慰抚工作。我宣传队随军入城，散发我军各种布告与宣传品，到处讲解我军各项政策和胜利形势。全城秩序迅速安定。人民纷纷交出蒋匪军强迫存放在家里的弹药、物资。该城经国民党的长期苛暴统治，粮荒严重，人民政府特委托中州农民银行南阳支行廉价供应市民粮食，仅八日一天内，该行即售出食粮一百市石（每石一百四十斤）。现全市商店、铺户已相继开业。被敌人严重摧残的各中、小学，也在市文化教育筹备委员会领导下，积极整理与恢复中。
