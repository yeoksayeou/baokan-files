　　Comrade Yang Guanzhu Persisted in Fighting After Being Wounded
　　Heroically Sacrificing Himself After Killing Three Enemies
　　[This Dispatch] Comrade Yang Guanzhu, member of the Armed Committee of the Sixth District of Tangyin, Taihang, encountered the enemy north of Guxian Village in the Sixth District on the morning of September 20th with only one member of the work team. The enemy and our forces were disproportionate. Even after the work team member was captured and he himself was wounded, he persisted in fighting the enemy, heroically sacrificing himself after killing three enemies. The Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee of the CCP has commended Comrade Guanzhu's heroic and unyielding great spirit of sacrificing himself to kill the enemy for the people's interests, calling on everyone to learn from Comrade Guanzhu's spirit of fearlessly killing the enemy, thoroughly eliminate the Kuomintang bandit army, and avenge Comrade Guanzhu. The Tangyin County Committee is instructed to hold a solemn memorial service and provide compensation to his family.

    【本报讯】太行汤阴六区武委会委员杨观柱同志，于九月二十日上午，仅带一个武工队员，在六区故贤村北与敌遭遇，敌我力量悬殊，直至武工队员被俘，自己身已负伤，仍坚持与敌搏斗，毙敌三名之后，英勇牺牲。对于观柱同志这种英勇不屈为人民利益而舍身杀敌的伟大精神，中共太行五地委特予以褒扬，号召大家学习观柱同志奋不顾身的杀敌精神，彻底消灭国民党匪军，为观柱同志复仇。并责成汤阴县委隆重追悼，并对其家属给予抚恤。
