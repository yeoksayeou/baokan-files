Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th -- Reports from various sources: The general strike of French miners, which began on October 4th, has persisted for over a month. The French Miners' Union issued a statement on the 7th, paying tribute to the striking miners and praising them, saying: "After five weeks of strike, the miners' confidence and fighting spirit remain undiminished."

After its military suppression proved ineffective, the French government launched a series of deceptive and optimistic propaganda campaigns, claiming that government troops had occupied the last mine on the 3rd. However, the fact is that only a small portion of the mining areas have resumed work, and in the northern region, which accounts for two-thirds of French coal mines, "the resumption of work is the weakest" (Associated Press, 6th).

The Queuille reactionary government, attempting to crush the stubborn resistance of labor, is conspiring to further deprive unions of their rights and arrest union leaders. According to a report from the Telegraph Agency, after a meeting of the French cabinet lasting several hours on the evening of the 3rd, the secretary of the Northern France Metalworkers' Union, Le Goupe, was arrested on charges of "inciting" the strike, and preparations are underway to arrest several other union leaders. However, French workers immediately responded to this reactionary measure by the government. The railway union, led by the General Confederation of Labor, voted on the 5th to hold a 24-hour general strike. At the same time, shipping in ports such as Marseille remained at a standstill. The government troops' work in various ports "had only unloaded a few thousand tons of coal by the 4th" (Telegraph Agency). The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a statement on the 5th, calling on French workers to strengthen their unity with the miners in their struggle to ensure the victory of the miners' strike, because the victory of the miners is bound to be the victory of the entire working class. The statement also vehemently protested against the government's attempt to enact reactionary legislation to deprive workers of their constitutional right to strike.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th -- Paris Dispatch: The French government has once again announced price increases. According to incomplete reports, the prices of fats, margarine, and edible oils sold in French stores on the 3rd of this month were twice as high as on the 30th of last month, sugar rose by 46 percent, and nationalized gas rose by 25 percent. The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party stated in a statement issued on the 5th that this price increase by the Queuille government has completely swallowed up the 15 percent wage increase that workers received when Queuille came to power. At the same time, the French General Confederation of Labor issued a communiqué condemning the French government's behavior as yet another despicable means used against the working class. The General Confederation of Labor has authorized its economic research department to draft new minimum wage standards based on the new prices.

　　法国矿工毫不退缩
  　总罢工已坚持月余
    法共号召全法工人与他们团结一致
    【新华社陕北十三日电】各方报导：法国矿工自十月四日开始的总罢工，已坚持月余。法国矿工工会特于七日发表声明，向罢工的矿工们致敬并赞誉称：“在罢工五个星期之后，矿工们的信心和战斗精神仍然毫不退缩。”
    法政府在军事镇压无效之后，发动一连串欺骗的乐观宣传，扬言政府军队已于三日占领最后一个矿坑。但事实是复工矿区仅为一小部分，而占全法煤矿三分之二的北方“复工最为微弱”（美联社六日电）。
    葛义反动政府妄图压倒劳工的顽强抵抗，已在阴谋进一步剥夺工会权利，逮捕工会领袖。据电通社消息，法内阁在三日晚集会数小时之后，以“鼓动”罢工罪名逮捕了法北五金工人工会书记勒古普，并准备继续逮捕若干其他工会领袖。但是，法国工人们立即对政府此种反动措施予以回击。总工会所领导的铁路工会，五日投票表决举行二十四小时的总罢工。与此同时，马赛等港口的航运仍陷于停顿状态。政府军队在各港口工作的结果，“到四日为止，他们只卸下了几千吨煤”（电通社）。法共政治局于五日发表声明，号召法国工人加强与矿工团结一致进行斗争，以保证矿工罢工的胜利。因为矿工的胜利必定是整个工人阶级的胜利。声明并猛烈抗议政府正企图进行反动立法以剥夺宪法给予工人的罢工权利。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】巴黎讯：法国政府再一次宣布提高物价。据不完全的报导，本月三日法国商店中出售之脂肪、人造奶油和食用油类价格比上月三十日高出一倍，食糖上涨百分之四十六，国有化煤气上涨百分之二十五。法共政治局在五日发表声明指出，葛义政府的这一提高物价，已完全淹没了葛义上台时工人所获得的百分之十五的增资。同时，法国总工会发表公报，谴责法政府这种行为是对工人阶级又一次地使用卑鄙手段。总工会已授权其经济研究处根据新物价草拟新的最低工资标准。
