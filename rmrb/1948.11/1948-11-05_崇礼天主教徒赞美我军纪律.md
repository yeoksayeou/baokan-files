Xinhua News Agency, Ping-Sui Front, 3rd. The excellent discipline of the People's Liberation Army when it entered Chongli, a famous Catholic city in Chahar Province, has been widely praised by the people of the city and Chinese and foreign Catholics. On the afternoon of the 1st of last month, when fighting was still taking place in the urban area, the People's Liberation Army first sent teams to guard the church. When the battle was completely over, all organs, schools, and warehouses in the city were guarded by the People's Liberation Army. City discipline was strictly enforced. A leader of a division headquarters of the People's Liberation Army went to the church to check on discipline and was stopped by guards because he did not have a military control commission certificate. During the fierce battle in the city, a paramedic took ten packets of Rendan and a thermometer from the hospital without authorization. When this was discovered, he was punished, and the original items were returned. The city has two Catholic churches. There is a convent (with two Dutch nuns), a monastery (with two Belgian priests), a orphanage (with 110 children), a hospital, a school, and a nursing home, covering an area of about half of this small city. Most of the city's residents are Catholics. Thanks to the meticulous protection of the People's Liberation Army, all church property, church members, and all public and private property suffered no losses except for some doors and window glass that were damaged by artillery fire. Residents who had fled for a time due to being deceived by the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs returned on the 2nd. Some even went to the troops to inquire about their relatives. Military control lasted only one and a half days. During the military control period, order was good, and the relationship between the military and civilians was extremely harmonious. From the 3rd, the municipal government actively flattened fortifications, convened various mass meetings, publicized the policies of the liberated areas, and carried out various investigations and clean-up work. The city quickly returned to normal. After seeing these facts with their own eyes, the foreign priests and all the Catholics in the city were full of praise for the People's Liberation Army. They suddenly realized that what was terrible was not the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, but the dark rule and deceptive propaganda of the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs.

    崇礼天主教徒赞美我军纪律
    【新华社平绥前线三日电】解放军进驻察哈尔省著名的天主教城市崇礼时的良好纪律，获得该城人民和天主教中外人员的普遍赞美。上月一日下午战斗尚在此分市区进行时，解放军即首先派队守护教堂。当战斗全部结束时，全城所有机关学校仓库，都得到解放军的守护。城市纪律执行得很严格。解放军师部某首长往教堂去检查纪律，因无军管会证件，即被卫兵阻止。城内正激战时，一个卫生员擅自进医院去拿了十包仁丹和一个体温表，当被发觉，即受处分，并将原物送回。该城属于天主教的建筑计有教堂二所。女修道院（内有荷兰籍修女二人）、男修道院（内有比利时籍神甫二人）、育婴堂（有小孩一百一十名）、医院、学校、养老院各一所，总面积约占这个小城的一半。全城居民多数是教徒。由于解放军的周密保护，所有教产教民及一切公私财产，除部分门窗玻璃受到炮火震毁外，别无损失。曾因受蒋傅匪帮欺骗一度逃避的居民，二日即相率回来。有的并到部队里都探问他们的亲属。军事管理只经过了一天半的时间，在军管期间，秩序良好，军民直系极为和洽。三日起，市政府即积极平毁工事，召开各种群众会议，宣传解放区政策及进行各项调查清理工作。市面迅速恢复常态。该城外国神甫和全体教民亲眼看到这些事实以后，对解放军赞佩不置。他们恍然大悟：原来可怕的不是共产党和解放军，而是蒋傅匪帮的黑暗统治和欺骗宣传。
