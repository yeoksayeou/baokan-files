　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Reports from various sources: Despite the armed suppression by the reactionaries, the great strike of French miners is still being heroically and resolutely maintained. Murderous Interior Minister Moch declared that the Queuille government launched a "large-scale offensive" in the main mining area of France—the northern coalfields—starting at dawn on October 25th. In order to carry out this "offensive," the reactionary government dispatched as many as 60,000 military police to this area, and used tanks and armored vehicles. However, this offensive did not proceed smoothly. As of the 31st, it had only occupied 58 of the 112 mine shafts in Northern France (Associated Press). Although the military police occupied the mine shafts, the vast majority of the miners did not resume work. The reactionaries shouted that "many miners have returned to work," but even according to their "statistics," the current coal production is only one-fifth of the normal output. To resist the reactionary's brutal atrocities, the General Confederation of Labor called on railway, dock, and maritime workers to strike against the transport of imported coal, in solidarity with their miner brothers. This call was first responded to by the dockworkers. As a result of their strike, hundreds of thousands of tons of imported coal have been left stranded on ships in various ports. When commenting on the struggle of the French miners, L'Humanité wrote: Facts prove that the methods of terrorism and the Hitlerite elements of the "Republican Security Companies" have neither affected the miners' struggle for bread nor the national sympathy for their just cause.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Reports from various sources: Workers in various countries continue to provide strong support to the striking French miners. The Italian General Confederation of Labor decided to provide financial assistance to French miners, and wished them "complete victory in their heroic struggle for bread and to defend threatened trade union rights." Czech state-owned construction workers are scheduled to work an extra shift today to donate 12 million Czech crowns to the striking French miners. State-owned chemical and metallurgical workers in Losov, Czech Republic, decided to work eighteen hours of overtime and donate all overtime wages to French miners, to show the fraternal friendship and international solidarity of the working class. The Executive Committee of the Scottish Area Miners' Union in the United Kingdom decided to send £1,000 to French miners. The Swiss Workers' Party held a meeting in Zurich, raising money to buy canned goods, milk, and other foods for French miners and their families. The just nature of the French miners' struggle is such that even John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America, will "suggest that Truman threaten to stop revival aid to force the French government to stop waging war on the miners" (United Press).
　　The Soviet Labor Newspaper wrote an article stating that French miners have received the sympathy and support of the working people of the world. Many countries have people supporting them. Their heroic struggle and the growing support movement around the world prove the consolidation of the world working class's unity and their readiness to resolutely counter all plans by the reactionaries to stifle the labor movement and impose the shackles of American imperialist aggression on the people of European countries.

    全世界劳动人民都同情支援他们
    【新华社陕北六日电】各方报导：不顾反动派的武装镇压，法国矿工的大罢工仍在英勇顽强地坚持着。杀人凶手内政部长莫许宣称，葛义政府于十月二十五日黎明起在法国的主要矿区——北部煤田发动“大规模攻势”。为了进行这一“攻势”，反动政府在这一地区出动的军警竟达六万之多，并使用了坦克车和装甲车。但这一攻势进行得并不顺利，截至三十一日止，还只占领了北法一百十二座矿坑中的五十八座（美联社）。虽然军警占领了矿坑，但绝大部分的矿二并没有复工。反动派叫喊着“复工的矿工很多”，但即令根据他们的“统计”，目前的煤产量也仅及平常产量的五分之一。为抗击反动派的凶残暴行，总工会号召铁路、码头及海员工人罢运入口煤斤，以声援他们的矿工弟兄。这一号召首先得到码头工人的响应，由于他们罢工的结果，已使数十万吨入口煤仍搁置在各港口的船上。人道报在评及法国矿工的斗争时写道：事实证明，恐怖主义的方法和“共和国保安队”的希特勒分子，既没有影响矿工争面包的斗争，也影响不了全国对他们的正义事业的同情。
    【新华社陕北六日电】各方报导：各国工人对法国罢工矿工继续作有力的声援。意大利总工会决定给予法国矿工以财政援助，并祝他们“为面包和保卫受威胁的工会权利而进行的英勇斗争全盘胜利”。捷克国营建筑工人定于今日额外作工一班，以捐助一千二百万捷币予法国罢工矿工。捷克罗索夫地方的国营化学及冶金工人，决定加班工作十八小时，将加班工资全部寄给法国矿工，以表示工人阶级的兄弟之谊和国际团结。英国苏格兰区的矿工工会执委会，决定寄一千英镑给法国矿工。瑞士工人党在苏黎世举行的会议上，募钱购买罐头、牛奶等食品给法国矿工及其家属。法国矿工斗争的正义性，甚至连美国矿工联合会主席路易斯也要“建议杜鲁门用停止复兴援助相威胁，以迫使法国政府停止向矿工发动战争”（合众社）。
    苏联劳动报著文称，法国矿工得到全世界劳动人民的同情和支持。许多国家都有人声援他们。他们的英勇斗争和全世界增涨中的声援运动，证明世界工人阶级团结的巩固和他们准备随时给予反动派妄图窒息劳工运动，并将美帝国主义侵略的枷锁加于欧洲各国人民的各种计划以坚决的反击。
