　　Shanghai Rice Riots Erupt
  　Tianjin and Hankou Prices Continue to Soar
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 11th] The grain shortage in the Nanjing-Shanghai area is severe, and rice riots have erupted in Shanghai. According to a Reuters dispatch on the 7th, the price of rice rose from 200 pseudo-Gold Yuan per dan to 280 pseudo-Gold Yuan within 24 hours, more than eleven times the limited price of 23 yuan per dan. However, even at such high prices, rice was unavailable in the market, resulting in three rice riots on the 6th alone. Twice, large groups of citizens looted rice shops in the western district, and once a rice truck was intercepted in Xujiahui, a suburb of Shanghai.
    In Nanjing: According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 6th, a new grain shortage has been created. Farmers are refusing to transport grain and other products into Nanjing. The grain shortage caused by strict price controls has barely "eased" when the panic of war triggered a new wave of hoarding. Prices in Nanjing, calculated in rapidly depreciating Gold Yuan, are rising daily.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 10th] Prices in Tianjin, Hankou, and other places are soaring. In Tianjin, on October 28th, the prices of grain, cotton, and cloth rose sharply within a single day. "Warship Brand" flour has risen to 90 to 96 yuan per bag (pseudo-Gold Yuan, same below), an increase of more than 50% compared to the 17th (more than eight times the limited price); rice is 2.1 yuan per jin, an increase of 40%; corn flour is 1.3 yuan per jin, an increase of 85% (more than three times the limited price). Cotton is 9 yuan per jin, an increase of 50%. Five Blessings Cloth is 150 yuan per bolt, an increase of 11% (more than four times the limited price). Prices continued to rise on the 29th. At the same time, newspapers published notices that public utilities and transportation would increase prices from November 1st. It is said that train passenger and freight prices will increase tenfold, further fueling price increases, and the market has fallen into chaos. Furthermore: In Hankou, since the liberation of Jinan, people have abandoned the pseudo-Gold Yuan one after another, secretly using silver dollars as currency. The exchange rate between the pseudo-Gold Yuan and silver dollars has fallen from two to one to fifteen to one. Prices have increased more than fourteen times.

　　上海发生抢米骚动
  　天津汉口物价继续猛涨
    【新华社陕北十一日电】京沪粮荒严重，上海发生抢米骚动。据路透社七日电称：米价在二十四小时内自每担伪金圆券二百元涨至二百八十元，比限价每担二十三元上涨十一倍多。但是即使这样高的价格，市上还是无法买到米，因此六日一天内发生了三次抢米骚动。两次是大群市民抢劫西区米店，一次是发生在沪郊徐家汇，米车一辆被拦劫。
    南京方面：据美联社六日电称，已造成新的粮荒。农民拒绝将粮食及其他产品运入南京。严厉的物价管制所造成的粮荒刚一“减轻”，战争的惊慌又引起了囤积的新浪潮。南京的物价，以急遽贬值的金圆计算，逐日均有上涨。
    【新华社陕北十日电】天津、汉口等地物价猛涨不已。天津十月二十八日一天之内，粮食棉花及布匹等价格突涨。兵船牌面粉每袋已涨为九十元到九十六元（伪金圆券，下同）较十七日上涨五成以上（较限价涨达八倍）；大米每斤二元一角，上涨四成；玉米面每斤一元三角，上涨八成五（较限价上涨达三倍多）。棉花每斤九元，上涨五成。五福布每匹一百五十元，上涨一成一（较限价上涨达四倍），二十九日物价继续上涨。与此同时，各报登载公用及交通事业将自十一月一日起加价，据称火车客货价将增十倍，因而更利激物价涨势，市场陷入混乱。又讯：汉口方面，自济南解放后，人民纷纷抛弃伪金圆券，暗以银元为通货。伪金圆券与银元比价由二比一跌至十五比一。物价涨了十四倍以上。
