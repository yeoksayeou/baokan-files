Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: New York, 8th -- American military commentator Mark Werner wrote in the New York Star, commenting on the Northeast battle, that the loss of Manchuria has "decisive significance" for the Nanjing regime. He pointed out that this failure has put Chiang Kai-shek's forces at a great disadvantage. He also said that under this balance of power, the Kuomintang's "defense is impossible to succeed." Werner quoted the words of the conservative London "Economist" magazine, saying: "Today the question is no longer whether Chiang Kai-shek will collapse, but when and how he will collapse." The magazine admitted that 50 to 90 percent of specialized students and politically active university youths in the Kuomintang-controlled areas sympathize with the Communist Party.

    蒋匪在东北的失败  使之居于极大劣势
    【新华社陕北十四日电】纽约八日讯：美国军事评论家马克·威尔纳在纽约明星报上著文论及东北之战时称：满洲的丧失对南京的统治有“决定意义”。他指出这一失败已使蒋介石的兵力居于极大劣势。又说：在这种力量对比之下，国民党的“防御不可能成功”。威尔纳援引伦敦保守的“经济学家”杂志的话说：“今天的问题已不是蒋介石是否会垮台，而是他什么时候垮台与如何垮台。”该杂志承认：国民党统治区百分之五十到百分之九十的专科学生和政治上积极的大学青年都同情共产党。
