Manual tilling groups were also organized in Donggucun in the second district, Jiaochuan and Wujiagou in the third district, and Bangou in the fourth district. In particular, Jia Tongbang from Lucun in the first district voluntarily formed a group, creating a method of dividing labor according to the land and rotating tilling, which led to rapid development of the group, growing from three to twelve people in four days. The tilling efficiency was also very high, with some people being able to till seven or eight fen per day, tilling seventy mu in seven days. After being commended in a circular by the county government, manual tilling has gradually increased in some villages.

　　屯留县府
  　奖励人力刨地
    【太岳电】屯留西故县等村组织人力刨地，克服秋耕中的畜力困难，获得很大成绩，县府特通报予以表扬。西故县村刨地小组十二个，共有一百二十人，十月二十六日统计，已刨地一百三十二亩半。县政府除通报表扬外，并奖给铁锹五个，他们刨地的劲头就更大了。此外，一区郭村连妇女也组织了两个掘地小组，东堰也有两个小组（七个人），四天刨地十五亩。二区的东故村、三区的交川、武家沟、四区半沟，均组织了刨地组。特别是一区路村贾同榜自愿结合的小组，创造了按地分工，轮流刨地的办法，使小组很快得到发展，四天内由三人发展到十二人；刨地效率也很高，有人每天能刨到七、八分，七天就刨了七十来亩。经县府通报表扬后，有些村的人力刨地更逐渐增多。
