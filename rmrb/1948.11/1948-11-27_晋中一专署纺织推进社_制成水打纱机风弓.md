Jinzhong First Special District Textile Promotion Society

Successfully Manufactures Water-Powered Spinning Machine and Wind Bow

[Jizhong News] The First Special District Textile Promotion Society, after three months of exploration, successfully manufactured a water-powered spinning machine and wind bow at the cost of 12,000 catties of millet, saving labor, improving efficiency and quality, reducing waste, and lowering costs. In the past, 64 spinning machines required two full laborers to operate by hand. The water-powered machine only needs half a laborer to watch the thread and change the flower angles. In terms of efficiency, it can do 11 hours of work in 9 hours, an increase of 25%. In terms of quality, the yarn spun by hand is uneven in tightness due to the varying speeds. The water-powered machine has a constant speed, which improves the quality. The yarn spun by hand weighs seven to eight ounces per bundle, while the water-powered machine only weighs five to six ounces. The uneven speed of hand spinning easily breaks the thread and wastes yarn. The water-powered machine has a uniform speed, which overcomes this problem. To weave a bolt of large cloth (five zhang long and two chi wide) with hand-spun yarn requires three catties ten to twelve ounces of yarn. Yarn spun by the water-powered machine only requires three catties one or two ounces. The wind bow uses manpower and can card seven catties of cotton per hour, while the water-powered machine can card fifteen catties per hour. Due to the increase in work efficiency and labor savings, the cost of cloth is greatly reduced. The structure of the water-powered spinning machine and wind bow is also very simple. (1) The structure of the water-powered spinning machine is roughly the same as a vertical water mill, except that two wooden wheels with a diameter of three chi and a thickness of three cun are attached to both ends of the water wheel's central axis. Above (referring to the middle of the central axis and the ground) are placed two large beams of seven cun in diameter (four in total, left and right). On top of the large beams are six iron shafts, six chi long and one cun square (three on each side). The central axis, with a wooden wheel of one chi two cun in diameter, and the water wheel axis are connected with a belt. The central axis then uses a belt to drive the left and right axes (called two belts). Each axis is equipped with two wooden wheels of one chi eight cun (referring to the six axes placed on the large beams). The belt passes through the floor and connects to the eight-cun wooden wheels on the spinning machine's wheel shaft. When the water hits and drives the water wheel, the wooden wheels at both ends rotate, and when the belts are attached, each axis starts to move, and the spinning machine starts to spin. (2) The water-powered wind bow eliminates the original iron wheel. An iron axis is installed below the wind bow, and the original wooden wheel on the left side of the wind bow is attached to the iron axis. An eighteen-cun wooden wheel is then installed on the iron axis, which is connected to the central wheel above the water wheel with a belt to make it move. (Han Jinshan)

　　晋中一专署纺织推进社
  　制成水打纱机风弓
    【冀中讯】一专纺织推进社，经过了三个月的摸索，用一万二千斤小米的代价制成了水打纱机及风弓，节省了劳力，提高了效率及质量，减少了浪费，减低了成本。过去，六十四根纱机，用手摇须用两个全劳力，水打机只用半劳力一人看线换花角即可。在效率上，九小时可做十一小时的活，增加了百分之廿五。质量上，手摇或快或慢，纺出来的线子松紧不匀；水打机速度经常，质量上也提高了一步。手摇纺下的线每把重七至八两，水打机只重五至六两。手摇快慢不一，易断线头，浪费线，水打机速度匀，克服了这个毛病。手摇机纺下的线，织一匹大布（五丈长二尺宽），需用线三斤十两至十二两，水打机纺下的线，只用三斤一、二两线即可。风弓用人力，每小时可弹花七斤，用水打每小时可弹十五斤。由于工作效率提高，劳力节省，大大的减低了布的成本。水打纱机风弓的构造也很简单。（一）水打纱机的构造，大体和立轮水磨一样，只是在水轮中轴的两端带了两个直径三尺厚三寸的木轮，上边（指中轴与地面中间）横放了粗七寸的两根大梁（左右共四根），大梁上边又横橙了长六尺方一寸的六根铁轴（一面三根），由中轴直径一尺二大的木轮和水轮轴用皮带拉起来，又由中轴用皮带拉动左右两轴（叫二皮带），每个轴上装制两个一尺八寸的木轮（指大梁上放的六根轴），用皮带通过地板和纱机轮轴上八寸大的木轮拉起来。水一来打动水轮，两端的木轮即旋转起来，挂上皮带，各轴都动起来，纱机就旋转开了。（二）水打风弓是把原用的铁大轮取消了，在风弓的下面按一个铁轴，把原风弓左面的木大轮按在铁轴上，铁轴上再装造一个一尺八寸的木轮，用皮带和水轮上面的中轮拉起来就动起来了。（韩金山）
