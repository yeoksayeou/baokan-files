Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th—Reliable sources in Shanghai have obtained credible information: the U.S. State Department and U.S. intelligence agencies are now jointly carrying out a huge conspiracy plan to sabotage the national liberation movements of China and other Asian countries. It is reported that in order to explain the necessity of this plan, the drafters of the plan, in their report to Truman, emphasized the "threat" posed by the people's liberation movements in Asia, particularly in China, to the United States. The report believes that the Communist Party of China's ruling area is determining the fate of communism in Asia. The report describes the Chinese liberated areas as follows: "For the first time in Chinese history, the Chinese people have a truly clean and honest government. Land reform here not only satisfies the demands of the peasants but also solves many unresolved economic problems in the communist-controlled areas. Because of this, the political system has become a very effective institution." The report acknowledges that American economic and military aid to Chinese reactionaries has completely failed. "Economic and military aid to China cannot turn soldiers who are unwilling to fight into combat-effective troops." The report concludes that since the end of World War II, the situation in Asia has posed a "powerful and fatal threat" to the positions of Western colonial countries, especially the United States, and that the United States needs Asia now more urgently than ever before. Losing its positions in Asia would bring "irreparable and devastating blows" to the United States. The report points out that Asia has entered a period of great events in social life, which can only be countered with a carefully considered action plan. The report therefore proposes a plan stipulating the establishment in Washington of a joint political organization dedicated to opposing so-called Asian communist activities, with departments for party work, trade union work, military work, student and women's work, reconnaissance and intelligence work. The tasks of this joint political organization are defined as follows: (1) Support "legitimate governments" in all possible ways. (2) Organize and fund "middle parties" to split and undermine national democratic movements. (3) Strive to reach an understanding with left-leaning elements in the Socialist Party. (4) Develop anti-communist activities in trade unions and farmers' associations. (5) Provoke conflicts among left-wing leaders and undermine their prestige. (6) Provoke and exploit frictions between various ethnic factions, especially in India, Annam, Burma, and Malaya. (7) Actively recruit traitors from the people's movements of various countries to participate in the work. (8) Collect and study all intelligence obtained through reconnaissance regarding anti-government movements. It is stipulated that the above tasks shall be under the unified leadership of the U.S. ambassadors to the respective countries. Shanghai sources say that the U.S. conspiracy plan has been agreed to by the British Foreign Office. Shanghai sources also say that this U.S. plan will be combined with recent U.S. measures in China and Japan. A central intelligence agency with American and Japanese spies participating has recently been established in MacArthur's headquarters in Japan, specializing in undermining Japanese democratic organizations and opposing leaders of the democratic movement. Many Japanese agents are participating in this agency, including the famous General Arisue. Under American instructions, the Japanese Veterans Association is still operating secretly and has established an organization specifically to undermine the democratic movement. The U.S. Strategic Intelligence Bureau in China, with its headquarters in Shanghai, is also cooperating with the Chinese Kuomintang's secret service to jointly undermine China's democratic movement. The Strategic Intelligence Bureau recently shipped a large number of radio stations, radio detectors, and cameras from the United States for espionage work. The U.S. intelligence agency has drafted a special implementation plan to undermine China's democratic movement, which has been approved by Stuart and Chiang Kai-shek. The executive agency of the plan will be headquartered in Nanjing, with local organizations established in the Northeast, North China, Central China, and Southeast regions.

    美帝进行巨大阴谋
    妄图破坏中国及亚洲各民族解放运动
    【新华社陕北三十日电】上海消息灵通方面获得可靠消息：美国国务院与美国间谍机关现在正联合进行一项破坏中国和亚洲各国民族解放运动的巨大阴谋计划。据悉：为了说明此项计划的必要，计划的拟订者在其向杜鲁门所提出的报告书中，曾着重说到亚洲的特别是中国的人民解放运动对于美国的“威胁”。报告书认为中国共产党统治区正在决定共产主义在亚洲的命运。报告书描写中国解放区说：“中国人在中国有史以来，第一次有了真正的廉洁忠实的政权。土地改革在这里不仅满足了农民的要求，而且解决了共产党统治区许多从未解决的经济问题。因为这样，政治制度就成为极有成效的机构。”报告书承认美国对于中国反动派的经济援助和军事援助完全失败。“对于中国的经济和军事援助，不能把不愿意打仗的士兵变成有战斗力的部队。”报告书在结论中认为：在第二次世界大战结束以后，亚洲的形势对于在西方的殖民国家首先是美国的阵地，已形成一种“强有力的致命的威胁”，而现在美国之需要亚洲却比任何旁的时候都迫切。丧失亚洲的阵地，将给美国带来“不可弥补的和毁灭性的打击”。报告书指出亚洲在社会生活方面已进入巨大事变的时期，只有经过详细考虑的行动计划才能加以对抗。报告书由此提出一项计划，该计划规定在华盛顿成立一个专事反对所谓亚洲共产主义活动的联合政治组织，内中分设关于党派工作、工会工作、军队工作、学生与妇女工作、侦察与情报工作的各部门。这个联合政治组织的任务规定如下：（一）用一切可能的办法支持各国“合法政府”。（二）组织与资助“中间党派”，以分裂和破坏民族民主运动。（三）力谋与社会党中的左倾分子取得谅解。（四）在工会与农会中发展反共活动。（五）挑拨各左派领导者中间的矛盾，并破坏他们的威信。（六）挑拨与利用各民族派别的摩擦，特别是在印度、安南、缅甸和马来亚。（七）积极吸收各国人民运动的叛徒参加工作。（八）收集和研究侦察得来的一切有关反政府运动的情报。上述各项工作规定由美国驻各该国的大使统一领导。上海消息称：美国的此项阴谋计划已获英国外交部同意。上海消息又称：美国此项计划将与美国最近在中日两国已有的措施相结合。在日本的麦克阿瑟参谋部中最近已成立一个有美日两国间谍参加的谍报中心机关，专事破坏日本民主组织、反对民主运动的领袖。参加这一机关的有许多日本特务，其中有著名的有末将军。根据美国的指示，日本在乡军人会仍在秘密活动，并成立一个专门破坏民主运动的组织。在中国的美国战略情报局，机关即设在上海，亦与中国国民党特务机关合作，以共同破坏中国的民主运动。战略情报局最近曾自美国运到大批无线电台、无线电侦察器和照像机，以为谍报工作之用。美国谍报机关已拟订一项破坏中国民主运动的专门实施计划，并已获得司徒雷登和蒋介石的批准。该计划的执行机关决定设总部于南京，而在东北、华北、华中、东南各地设立地方组织。
