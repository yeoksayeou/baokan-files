    [Taiyue Electricity] According to the Gaoping County Mass Newspaper on the 5th of this month, the vast majority of areas in Gaoping County are still drifting along with autumn ploughing. Two days before the Beginning of Winter, the county had only ploughed about 40% of its autumn land. In Zhao Village, in the first district, only 13.7% of the land had been ploughed, in five joint defense villages in the fourth district only 26% had been ploughed, and in four joint defense villages in the fifth district only 34% had been ploughed. Only the third district is doing relatively well, having ploughed over 83% of the land. If the weather changes, the county will be unable to complete its plan to plough all autumn land once. Therefore, the newspaper calls for strengthening leadership and overcoming the drifting along. It also criticized the mistake of the cadres of Guo Village in the fifth district, the chairman of the Farmers' Association in Zhao Village, and the cadres of Zhai Li Village for not leading autumn ploughing but taking the lead in performing operas.

　　高平秋耕还在自流
    【太岳电】据本月五日高平县大众报载，高平全县绝大部分地区秋耕仍在自流。至立冬前两天，全县秋地还未耕到百分之四十。一区赵庄四个村，才耕地百分之十三点七，四区五个联防村才耕了百分之二十六，五区四个联防村才耕了百分之三十四。仅三区较好，已耕地百分之八十三以上。如果天气发生变化，该县就无法完成秋地普犁一遍的计划。因此该报号召加紧领导，克服自流。并批评了五区郭村干部、赵庄农会主席及宰李村干部不领导秋耕而带头唱戏的错误。
