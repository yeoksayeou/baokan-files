　　Comrades Wang Chunhu and Zhang Hongduo:
    The issue of resettling blind beggars and unemployed vagrants should indeed be a concern. In addition to instructing the PingShan County government to draft detailed measures, we are also studying this issue. (Ministry of Civil Affairs) Comrade Liang Zirong, Yangquan City Government:
    If Comrade Chen Bingli of Nanyaozhuang Village, Fourth District of your city, was indeed unyielding in the struggle against the enemy and was captured and killed by the Japanese invaders, and if no pension was received after his sacrifice, you can bring supporting documents to your city's municipal government to receive a supplementary payment. Regardless of his family background, it should be supplemented according to law. (Ministry of Civil Affairs) Comrade Li Shuangming, Taihang Fifth District:
    Regarding your land being cultivated on your behalf, according to government regulations, it should not be cultivated on your behalf. If no one is in your family, you can entrust village cadres, relatives, or neighbors to rent it out to solve the problem. In addition to the public grain each year, the remaining grain can be entrusted to others for safekeeping or deposited into a cooperative for future marriage use.　　　　　(Ministry of Civil Affairs)

　　信箱王春虎、张鸿铎同志：
    关于讨吃瞎子与无业游民的安置问题，实应关心，除已令平山县政府拟俱办法外，我们亦正在研究此一问题。（民政部）阳泉市府梁子荣同志：
    你市四区南窑庄村陈秉礼同志，如确系在对敌斗争中坚贞不屈而遭日寇捕杀，牺牲后又确未领取恤金，可持证明文件，前往你市市政府补领，不论其家庭成份如何，均应依法补给。（民政部）太行五分区李双明同志：
    对你的土地代耕问题，按政府规定不应代耕。你家无人，可托村干、亲、邻以出租来解决。每年除出公粮外，所剩之粮，可托人代管或入合作社，以备将来结婚使用。　　　　　（民政部）
