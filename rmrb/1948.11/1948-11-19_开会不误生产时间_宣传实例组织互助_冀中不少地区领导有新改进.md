　　Holding Meetings Does Not Delay Production Time
    Promote Examples and Organize Mutual Assistance
  　Leadership in Many Areas of Central Hebei Has Made New Improvements
    [Central Hebei Telegram] This year, many areas in Central Hebei have made new improvements in leading agricultural production: First, meetings, deployments, inspections, and surveys do not delay the production time of the masses (including village cadres). At the beginning of the autumn harvest and wheat planting in Nanshan, Raoyang, more than 30 cadres from the entire village were organized into the production committee, and expanded cadre meetings were held frequently. However, it was always difficult to gather everyone, and it took a long time, so the cadres were bored and said: "I'm already too busy with my own work. It's very tiring to cut grain for a whole day, and now there's another meeting!" Later, after review, the production committee was streamlined to seven people, and it was changed to lead by dividing the village into seven sections according to street, with two cadres as the heads and deputy heads of each section, specializing in promoting the work of their respective sections. The seven members of the production committee each fixed on a section, specializing in conveying, supervising, and inspecting work. Once, when registering livestock and investigating the acreage of wheat planting, they made "door-to-door visits" in sections after lunch and in the evening, which was completed quickly, and the masses were satisfied, and the cadres did not delay their production time. Beishan Village in the county created a new method of holding meetings during the busy farming season: using the time after dinner and before bed, when the masses like to gather together to chat casually (such as in the streets or at the temple platform), they went to hold meetings there. In advance, the cadres divided the work among themselves, and whoever was familiar with a certain area would go to that area to speak. Because it was not a "hard meeting" from top to bottom, but an informal meeting that naturally transformed from casual chat into a meeting with a central topic, the masses easily accepted it and did not find it troublesome. While speaking, the masses naturally raised some questions, and discussions were launched and resolved. The number of attendees at such meetings exceeded the number of people who attended previous village-wide meetings. Second, promoting the masses' own innovative methods and new experiences to promote the overall situation. Shi Lao Ya, a resident of Mengzhang Village in Shulu, fed a donkey that could pull a waterwheel to irrigate two acres of land a day, but it was weak and could only plow one acre of land. Zhao Jizong fed an ox that could plow three acres of land a day, but it walked slowly and could only irrigate one acre of land a day with a waterwheel. Later, the two families helped each other, using the ox to plow and the donkey to pull the waterwheel, and everyone felt it was convenient. The district cadres publicized this matter everywhere, and the masses thought it was very good, and some also formed partnerships. Wangjiazhuang Village in Jin County organized mutual assistance by first gathering existing partners, inviting production activists and heads of farmers' association groups to participate, and letting those who had formed mutual assistance groups introduce the benefits of partnering. After the meeting, they went to the masses to publicize and deliberate, and as a result, ten new mutual aid groups were formed within four days. Third, the cadres who went to the countryside jointly promoted agricultural techniques. The county magistrate of Gaoyang personally helped farmers soak seeds in Jiucheng Village, while doing it, he publicized the benefits of soaking seeds. Zhao Min, the district committee member working in Beifuzhuang, Wenxin, taught two cadres to soak seeds. They plowed the next morning, and when they dug them up in the evening, they had already taken root and sprouted. They used the facts to promote the masses to soak seeds. According to incomplete statistics from more than 50 villages in 15 counties, 164 households selected seeds in the field, and 213 households soaked seeds for wheat planting, using more than 30,000 jin of salt water to float wheat seeds to prevent insect pests.

　　开会不误生产时间
    宣传实例组织互助
  　冀中不少地区领导有新改进
    【冀中电】冀中不少地区，今年在领导农业生产上，有了新的改进：第一、开会布置与检查调查等工作不耽误群众（包括村干部）生产时间。饶阳南善在秋收种麦之初，曾把全村三十多个干部都组织到生产委员会中，动不动就开扩干会，但每次都集合不齐人、还耽误好长时间，干部们都腻烦的说：“自己的活还忙不过来，割一天谷子很累的慌，又开会呀！”后来，经过检讨，把生产委员会精简到七个人，并改为按街道分七片领导，每片有两个干部当正副组长，专推动本片的工作。生产委员会的七个委员，每人固定一片，专门传达和督促检查工作。有一次，登记牲口和调查种麦亩数，在一天午饭后和晚上，分片“挨门拜访”，很快就完成了，群众也满意，干部也没耽误生产时间。该县北善村，在农忙季节，创造了新的开会方法：利用晚饭后和睡觉前，群众好在那一块凑伙拉闲话（如街头、庙台），就在那一块去开会。事先，干部们先分好工，谁在那一块熟，谁就到那一块去讲。因为不是自上而下的“硬开会”，而是不拘形式，以拉闲话很自然的转变成有中心的会议，群众很容易接受，不嫌麻烦。一边讲着，群众很自然的提出一些问题，就展开讨论，得到解决。这样的会，到场听众，均超过以往开全村大会的人数。第二、发扬群众自己创造的新办法、新经验，推动全盘。束鹿孟章村民石老哑喂着一个驴，拉水车一天能浇二亩地，可是劲小，耕地只能耕一亩。赵纪宗喂着一头牛，一天能耕三亩地，可是走得慢，拉水车一天只能浇一亩。后来两家互助起来，用牛耕地，用驴拉水车，谁也感到方便。区干部就把这件事到处宣传，群众都觉得很好，有的也就搭起伙来。晋县王家庄组织互助，是先把旧有插伙干活的召集起来，请生产积极分子和农会小组长参加，让互助起来的人介绍插伙干活的好处，会后到群众中去宣传酝酿，结果，在四天内就结成十个新互助组。第三、下乡干部一齐动手推广农作技术。高阳县长在旧城村，亲自帮助农民浸种，一边做，一边宣传浸种的好处。在文新北傅庄工作的区委赵民，教给两个干部浸了种，第二天上午耕上，傍黑刨开一看，已扎上根，发了芽。用事实推动了群众浸种。根据十五个县五十多个村不完全统计，有一百六十四户做到田间选种，有二百一十三户浸种种麦，为防虫病而用盐水漂小麦种约三万余斤。
