Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 11th: The Northeast Daily recently published an editorial entitled "Celebrating the Liberation of Shenyang, Celebrating the Liberation of Northeast China." It began by stating: The Kuomintang bandit army that had ravaged the people of Northeast China for three years has been subjected to a final reckoning. November 2, 1948, this great day, Shenyang was liberated! All of Northeast China was liberated! The most important industrial city and the most resource-rich region of Northeast China will henceforth belong to the people forever! November 2nd is another "August 15th" for the people of Northeast China, the most celebratory carnival for all the people of Northeast China. The editorial stated: The liberation of Shenyang and the entire Northeast has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique. After the "August 15th" restoration, the Kuomintang bandit army, with the support of U.S. imperialism, brought the rule of "Second Manchuria" and the disaster of war to the people of Northeast China. When the enemy swaggered in, arriving in Northeast China on American planes and warships, they were once arrogant, believing that relying on American guns and weapons, they could run rampant in Northeast China, overcome everything, and arbitrarily enslave the people of Northeast China. But the relentless facts were contrary to what the U.S. and Chiang reactionary派s had envisioned! In the more than two years of the Northeast Liberation War, the American-equipped corps sent by the U.S. and Chiang reactionary派s to attack the people of Northeast China never won a battle, but only served as transportation teams for the Northeast People's Liberation Army. Now, the million-strong army that Chiang Kai-shek sent to the Northeast battlefield has been lost completely, men and guns, and the bloody bet that U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang have tried their best to throw into the Northeast has been completely lost. Now, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique still pins its hopes on more "American aid," and U.S. imperialism also hopes that Chiang Kai-shek can still hold on to North China, Central China, and South China; but the Chinese people have the right to believe that American aid could not save the people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek's fate in the Northeast, and it will not save his fate in all of China.

The editorial then pointed out: Although Northeast China has been completely liberated, the whole country has not yet been finally liberated. Our struggle with the Kuomintang reactionary派s directed by U.S. imperialism has not ended. Just as the brotherly liberated areas in the past powerfully cooperated with the heroic struggle of our Northeast liberated area, we must also do our best to support and cooperate with the heroic struggle of the liberated areas inside the Pass in the future. In the future, the Northeast Field Army will also drive into the Pass and fight alongside the brotherly troops inside the Pass to pursue and annihilate the Kuomintang bandit army. In the future, the nine provinces of Northeast China have become the rear, and our glorious responsibility to support the sacred People's Liberation War has become even heavier. Northeast China is rich in resources and has a large population, and it is the center of the country's industry, especially heavy industry. We must more consciously and systematically give full play to the great manpower and material resources of Northeast China, and with the greatest effort, strengthen the economic construction work in Northeast China, especially to rapidly restore and develop the industrial production of Northeast China, to powerfully support the war and accelerate the final victory of the liberation war in the entire region.

The editorial finally called on the Northeast military and civilians to guard against arrogance and rashness, and to work more conscientiously under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau, to meet new and great tasks, and called on the Northeast Field Army fighting in the Pass to unite closely with the brotherly troops inside the Pass and learn from them with humility.

　　东北日报号召东北军民
  　充分发挥人力物力支援关内解放战争
    【新华社哈尔滨十一日电】此间东北日报顷以“庆祝沈阳解放，庆祝东北解放”为题发表社论。首称：蹂躏东北人民三年之久的国民党匪军已经受到了最后制裁。一九四八年十一月二日这个伟大日子，沈阳解放了！全东北解放了！全中国最重要的工业城市和物产最丰富的东北地区，从此将永远地属于人民了！十一月二日，这是东北人民的另一个“八一五”，是全东北人民最可庆祝的狂欢节。社论称：沈阳和全东北的解放，使美帝国主义及蒋介石反动集团受到了沉重的打击。东北在“八一五”光复以后，国民党匪军在美帝国主义支持下给东北人民带来了“二满洲”的统治及战争的灾害。当敌人耀武扬威地坐着美国飞机、军舰来到东北时，曾经夜郎自大，以为依靠美国枪炮武器，可以在东北横行无阻，战胜一切，任意奴役东北人民。但无情的事实偏偏和美、蒋反动派所设想的相反！在两年多的东北解放战争中，美、蒋反动派先后派来进攻东北人民的美械化兵团，却从来不能打胜仗，而只是充当了东北人民解放军的运输队。现在蒋介石送到东北战场的百万大军已连人带枪丢得精光，美帝国主义及蒋介石匪帮所竭力投掷到东北的血腥赌注，至此是全部输光了。现在，蒋介石反动集团还寄希望于更多的“美援”，美帝国主义也希望蒋介石还能保住华北、华中、华南；但中国人民有权利可以相信：美援没有能够挽救得了人民公敌蒋介石在东北的命运，同样，也挽不了他在全中国的命运。
    社论继指出：东北虽已完全解放，但全国还没有最后解放。我们和美帝国主义指使下的国民党反动派的斗争还没有结束。正象过去各兄弟解放区曾经有力地配合了我们东北解放区的英勇斗争一样，今后我们也要竭尽全力，支援和配合关内各解放区的英勇斗争。今后东北野战军还要长驱入关，和关内兄弟部队并肩作战，追歼国民党匪军。今后东北九省已成为后方，我们支援神圣的人民解放战争的光荣责任更加加重。东北物产丰富，人口众多，是全国工业特别是重工业的重心。我们必须更加有计划有组织的充分发挥东北伟大的人力物力，用最大的努力，加强东北的经济建设工作，特别要迅速恢复和发展东北的工业生产，来有力地支援战争，加速全区解放战争的最后胜利。
    社论最后号召东北军民戒骄戒躁，更加兢兢业业在中共中央和东北局的坚强领导下，来迎接新的伟大任务，号召进关作战的东北野战军和关内兄弟部队亲密团结，向他们虚心学习。
