Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 28th: At a time when the Northeast People's Liberation Army is launching a victorious offensive to annihilate the Kuomintang bandit troops in Northeast China, the Harbin Special City Education Bureau and the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League jointly organized the autumn sports meet to strengthen the physical fitness of young people and to launch mass sports activities. The conference opened on the 11th of this month. Participants included more than 60 universities, middle schools, and primary schools, as well as 83 units including the Municipal Government, the Electric Power Bureau, the Harbin Department Store, factories, and municipal hospitals, totaling more than 30,000 people. Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Political Committee, Che Xiangchen, Minister of Education, Han Tianshi, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Northeast Communist Youth League, and Rao Bin, Deputy Mayor of the City, all personally went to provide guidance. On the first day of the sports meet, more than 8,000 athletes took an oath to give full play to the revolutionary youth's spirit of unity, friendship, and collectivism, and to oppose individual heroism and the pursuit of championships. The main content of the conference included a joint production exercise performed by 3,000 middle school students, with neat movements and vibrant spirits, which won continuous praise from the audience. At the same time, there were also exciting programs such as relay races, track and field events, and group tug-of-war. More than 24,000 primary school students from 47 primary schools in the city also held group performances by district, among which the "Victory Freehand Exercise" of Taiping School, the "Double Ten Gymnastics" of Fuhua School, the "Happy Labor Dance" of Nangang School, and the "Worker-Peasant-Soldier Exercise" of Zhaolin School were better. The conference lasted for four days. Despite the autumn wind and drizzle, the athletes insisted on carrying out the competition program in an orderly manner.
