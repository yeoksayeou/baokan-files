(Jizhong, 13th Dispatch) The grain protection struggle in the edge regions of Qingyuan County has achieved significant results in September and October, thanks to the active efforts of the entire county's Party, government, military, and people to strike against the enemy. As soon as the autumn harvest began, Fu bandits in Baoding used bandit "Daxiangs" (large villages), "Baojing" (security police) teams, and local secret agents to capture people, seize livestock, and rob grain in the edge areas of Qingyuan. Before the end of September, in the 4th and 8th districts alone, 110 people were captured. After the masses began threshing, the enemy's main force, in coordination with the bandit puppet "Daxiang" security teams, began to loot grain in southern Baoding. On October 14th alone, they captured more than 200 people from Lang Village. The masses used the condition of handing over 30 catties of grain per mu as an exchange. In addition, the enemy also used the puppet Bao chiefs who were wandering in Baoding to send notes to the villages, assigning the amount of grain to each household, and ordering them to send the grain to Baoding by household.

In order to crush Chiang bandits' conspiracy to rob grain, the county's Party, government, military, and people were unanimously mobilized. After discovering that bandit Daxiang secret agents were arresting people in various villages, the leadership promptly launched a mass-based village defense movement, educating the bad elements and smugglers in various villages severely, and digging out the enemy's eyes and ears. As a result, the activities of secret agents in various villages were quickly suppressed. After the enemy began to rob grain, we mainly focused on the following links in the struggle against the enemy: First, for the key villages attacked by Chiang bandits, strong county and district cadres led troops to defend the villages and strike at the enemy, making it difficult for Chiang bandits to enter any village. And for the front-line villages with frequent battles, we made every effort to support them. After the fortifications of a certain village were destroyed by the enemy after a battle, a certain district mobilized the masses in nearby villages to help rebuild them. The county's armed forces department also promptly supplied ammunition to these villages, helping the villages solve any problems that could be solved. Second, the militia and local armed forces closely cooperated. After Chiang bandits surrounded a village, the troops actively supported them. The working team combined with the troops, frequently went deep into the enemy's rear to strike at small groups of Chiang bandit grain collectors, and destroyed the puppet organizations that secretly collected grain for the enemy in the villages. Third, we implemented a policy of "strengthening the walls and clearing the fields." Except for a portion of the grain left for consumption, each family hid everything they had. Firewood was also appropriately fortified. This made the enemy helpless after arriving in the village, unable to find people or grain. After two months of heroic grain protection struggle by the county's army and people, great victories have been achieved. The militia and local armed forces protected the grain of the broad masses. In September and October alone, the militia in three districts fought 45 battles, killing and wounding 344 Chiang bandits, capturing two rifles, hundreds of bullets, and one rifle body.

　　清苑军民积极打击傅匪
  　护粮斗争连获胜利
    【冀中十三日电】清苑边缘区的护粮斗争，经全县党政军民积极打击敌人，九、十两月中，已获重大成绩。秋收刚开始，保定傅匪对清苑边缘区即利用匪大乡、保警队，结合当地特务，到各村抓人抢牲口、抢粮食，在九月底以前只在四、八两个区，即抓走群众一百一十人。到群众打场以后，敌主力配合匪伪大乡保安队开始到保南抢粮。只十月十四日一次就抓走郎村二百多人。群众以每亩交粮三十斤，为交换条件。此外敌人还利用流浪在保定的伪保长，向村里送条子将粮数分派到每户，叫以户为单位往保定送粮。
    为粉碎蒋匪抢粮阴谋，该县党政军民一致动员。发现匪大乡特务与各村抓人后，领导上及时发动群众性的联防村运动，对各村的坏人和走私，严重的进行了教育，挖掉敌人的眼目。这样一来各村特务活动很快即被镇压下去。敌人开始抢粮以后，我们对敌斗争上主要抓住以下几个环节：一、对蒋匪突击的重点村，由坚强的县区干部带兵，坚持村庄打击敌人，使蒋匪到一个村，都感到不易。并对战斗频繁的第一线村庄，作到了全力支援。某村战斗后工事被敌人毁坏，某区便发动了附近各村群众协助修筑。县武装部对这些村庄也及时的供给弹药，帮助村解决可能解决的困难。二、民兵地武密切结合，蒋匪包围一个村庄后，部队即积极支援。武工队结合部队，经常深入敌后，打击小股征粮蒋匪，摧毁了给敌人在村暗地征粮的伪组织。三、实行坚壁清野，粮食除留下一部吃的外，各家都藏一个一干二净。柴火也适当的坚壁了。使敌人到村后见不到人，找不到粮食，束手无策。经过该县军民两个月来英勇的护粮斗争，已获得很大胜利。民兵地武保护了广大群众的粮食。计九、十两个月，只在三个区民兵就作战四十五次，单独毙伤蒋匪三百四十四名，缴获大枪两支，子弹数百发，枪身一个。
