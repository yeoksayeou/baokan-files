Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 17th: The rule of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime in South Korea has fallen into an increasingly unstable crisis. According to a Pyongyang radio broadcast cited by TASS on the 9th, the troops and people who revolted in Yeosu are still conducting guerrilla warfare in Jeolla Nam-do and Jeolla Buk-do in southwestern Korea. Foreign news agencies also reported that on October 16th, an armed conflict broke out in Daegu, Gyeongsang Nam-do, in southeastern Korea, when the people resisted the puppet government. On the 3rd of this month, an armed conflict occurred between mutinying soldiers and military police. The mutinying soldiers defeated the military police and cut off telecommunications between Daegu and other cities. According to the puppet Ministry of the Interior, a riot also occurred on Ganghwa Island northwest of Incheon Port near Seoul on October 28th; the guerrillas on Jeju Island are also still active. The American puppet regime, attempting to save its ruling crisis by means of terror, has intensified its frantic arrest of the people after an emergency meeting on the 3rd of this month. The puppet Minister of the Interior admitted on the 8th that 800 "anti-government elements" had been arrested in one week. Due to the severity of the crisis, infighting for power and profit has continued to occur between the puppet National Assembly and the puppet government. The puppet National Assembly accused the "government of losing the people's faith" on the 8th, stating that it "should bear full responsibility for the occurrence of the rebellion," and passed a resolution demanding the reorganization of the Syngman Rhee government by a vote of eighty-six to twenty-four (thirty-five abstentions). Syngman Rhee immediately rejected it.

　　南朝鲜到处发生暴动
  　李承晚统治日趋不稳
    【新华社陕北十七日电】南朝鲜李承晚傀儡政权的统治，已陷于日趋不稳的危机中。据塔斯社九日引平壤电台消息称，前在丽水起义的部队及人民，仍在朝鲜西南部全罗南道和全罗北道进行游击战。又据外国通讯社报导：朝鲜东南部庆尚南道的大邱，十月十六日曾发生人民反抗傀儡政府的武装冲突事件，本月三日又发生哗变军队与宪兵警察的武装冲突。哗变军击溃了宪警，并切断了大邱和其他城市间的电讯交通。据伪内政部透露，汉城附近仁川港西北的江华岛，十月二十八日也发生暴动；济洲岛的游击队亦仍在活动中。妄图以恐怖手段来挽救其统治危机的美国傀儡政权，于本月三日紧急会议后，更加紧对人民的疯狂逮捕。伪内政部长八日承认，一周中逮捕的“反政府分子”达八百人。由于危机的严重，伪国会与伪政府之间不断发生争权夺利的争吵。伪国会于八日指责“政府丧失人民信仰”，“对叛乱之发生应负全部责任”，并以八十六票对二十四票（三十五票弃权），通过要求李承晚政府改组的决议。李承晚则立即予以拒绝。
