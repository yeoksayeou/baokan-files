　　【Jizhong News】This year during the hot season, the Hutuo River flooded, causing water damage to many villages along both banks within Gaocheng. Only Dongsi Gong, Gaozhuang, and other three villages, with more than 1,600 households and more than 16,000 mu of land, were flooded, accounting for about 80 percent of the total land. More than 7,000 mu were also silted up with sand. Most of these villages had no harvest in the autumn, and the livestock had nothing to eat. Each animal still needed to eat grass and feed. The urgent demand of the masses was to hire out labor to solve the difficulties in the lives of people and livestock. The Promotion Society, according to the needs of the masses, discussed with the county party committee and decided to engage in the coal business, on the one hand to supply the masses for burning, and on the other hand to organize the masses in the disaster areas to hire out their labor. Since the beginning of September, two batches of 230 tons of coal have been approved from the Pingding Coal and Iron Shop, and 93 carts organized by the district and village have been combined. In more than a month, more than 257,000 jin of coal have been transported to Nanmeng, Hebei, using 258 carts, and the carts have earned more than 3.7 million yuan in freight. Xia Wenhuan of Xisigong Village earned 120,000 yuan in freight; Xia Chunchang and his four brothers jointly raised an ox. In addition to planting millet for everyone, they earned 95,000 yuan in freight by hauling coal. The stevedores earned more than 250,000 yuan. Not only those who hired out labor, took boats, and unloaded goods benefited, but also the masses found it convenient to burn coal. The brick kilns saw that there was coal, and the brick kilns in Liangjia Village and Beimeng also started burning.

　　藁城推进社注意群众要求
  　根据需要经营煤炭业
    【冀中讯】今年伏天滹沱河闹水，藁城境内沿河两岸不少的村都受了水灾，只东西四公、高庄等三个村，有一千六百余户的一万六千多亩地被淹，约占总地亩百分之八十。还有七千余亩淤上了沙子。这些村大部秋天没收成，喂着牲口也没有活，每个牲口还要吃草吃料，群众迫切要求是拉脚解决人畜生活困难。推进社根据群众要求，和县委讨论决定经营煤炭业务，一方面供给群众烧的，一方面组织灾区群众拉脚。自九月开始以来，两次从平定煤铁店批了煤炭二百三十吨，并结合区村组织起来的大车九十三辆，一个多月的工夫，已运到河北南孟煤炭二十五万七千多斤，用大车二百五十八辆，大车上共得运费三百七十余万元。西四公村夏文焕，赚运费十二万元；夏春常兄弟四人伙养一牛，除给大伙种上黍子外，拉煤炭赚运费九万五千元，脚行工人装卸船车得利二十五万余元。不但拉脚、乘船、卸车的都得到了利益，群众烧煤炭也方便了。烧窑的见到有了煤炭，梁家庄、北孟的砖窑也烧起来了。
