Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: According to a Central News Agency report from Shanghai on the 23rd, the Kuomintang government-run enterprise "China Textile Industries Corporation" has been ordered to flee south to Taiwan and Guangdong. The Kuomintang government has decided to list 75,000 spindles, a portion of the company's Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai spindles, as the first batch of relocation targets. This move demonstrates that the Nanjing clique, facing repeated disastrous military defeats, has completely lost confidence in the defense of the Pingjin (Beijing-Tianjin), and Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) areas, and is openly plundering the people's wealth to escape. "China Textile Industries Corporation" is one of the "seized" properties of the Kuomintang reactionary government after the Japanese surrender. It has 60 factories located in the aforementioned three areas, producing five major categories of cotton, wool, hemp, silk, and rayon. The total number of cotton spindles is 1.8 million, accounting for more than two-fifths of the country's total spindles.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 23rd: People arriving from Qingdao report that Qingdao is being completely sold out to the United States by the Kuomintang. The Kuomintang Qingdao Garrison Headquarters and the 11th Pacification Zone have both moved outside the city, and the city's defense will soon be handed over to the American army. The American army is now actively expanding and strengthening its defenses. The Dagang wharf on the west side of Qingdao, the Zhanqiao pier and Tuandao Island on the south side, the Qingdao Mountain and Zhanshan area on the east side, the Taizhouzhen Dengzhou Road area on the north side, the Cangkow airfield, and various larger buildings in the city have all long been directly occupied by the American army and designated as American military defense zones and security zones. The only water source at Baisha River in the north of the city, which had not been taken over by the American army, has recently been taken over by the American army. The American army occupies almost half of Qingdao's six or seven wharves. In addition to the original airport directly controlled by the American army, the American army also plans to build a new airport. The oil pipeline that the American army recently wants to build, running directly from the coast to the airport, is guarded by the American army on both sides, completely closing off Qingdao's only land import route. The U.S. 38th Special Mixed Fleet, which came to Qingdao not long ago, was originally scheduled to return to the United States this month, but according to a United Press report from Honolulu on the 18th, it has also changed its plan and "will remain off the coast of China." Qingdao originally had three to four thousand U.S. Marines, and the U.S. Navy Department recently announced that it would send an additional 1,250 people to Qingdao under the pretext of "protecting the evacuation of overseas Chinese." There are frequent live-fire exercises by American planes and warships on the sea surface of Qingdao, and frequent live-fire landing exercises by American troops on nearby Yan'er Island. The mountains are often filled with American troops practicing so-called "defense warfare." The Kuomintang Executive Yuan passed a resolution on the 17th to announce the implementation of "temporary martial law" in Qingdao and forced a large-scale evacuation of citizens, ignoring the danger of unemployment and starvation for the workers. The Kuomintang bureaucrat-capitalists in Qingdao have drafted a plan for the factories to flee south.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: The Kuomintang traitorous government has announced the establishment of a new supreme economic institution to facilitate the comprehensive control of the Kuomintang's finances and economy by American imperialism. The institution is named the "Economic Coordination Committee," and its "organizational key points" were passed at a temporary meeting of the puppet Executive Yuan on the 20th. It stipulates that it will be composed of the puppet Executive Yuan President, the ministers of the four ministries of Finance, Transportation, Industry and Commerce, and Food, the Chairman of the Resources Committee, and the President of the Central Bank, and will be directly supervised by the US Economic Cooperation Administration. Its nominal task is to "coordinate US aid, regulate materials, and stabilize the financial economy." The "key points" stipulate that representatives of the ECA branch must be invited to attend each meeting of the committee and its subordinate working groups. The puppet Minister of Finance, Xu Kan, shamelessly declared in a speech on the 21st that the establishment of the committee "may create a new milestone in Sino-American economic cooperation." At the same time, the Kuomintang CC newspaper Shanghai News advocated a "completely open door policy" towards the United States, calling for "American and British commercial companies to freely invest in South China and the Yangtze River Delta region" in order to hand over the railways, mines, and inland waterway navigation of these regions to the United States and other foreign aggressors.

　　蒋匪防守信心全失
  　平津沪“中纺公司”开始南逃
    青岛正被完全出卖给美国
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据中央社上海二十三日消息透露：国民党政府官营企业“中纺公司”已奉命南逃台湾和广东。国民党政府已决定将该公司天津、青岛及上海纱锭之一部分七万五千锭列为第一批迁移对象。此举表明南京小朝廷在军事节节惨败下，对平、津、及京、沪地区之防守已完全丧失信心，而公开席卷人民财富逃亡。中统公司为国民党反动政府在日本投降后所发的“劫收”财之一，工厂共六十座分设上述三地，出产棉、毛、麻、绢丝及人造丝五大类，棉纺锭共一百八十万锭，占全国纺锭五分之二以上。
    【新华社山东二十三日电】青岛来人谈：青岛正在被国民党完全出卖给美国。国民党青市警备司令部及十一绥区均已移至市外，市内防务即将交给美军。美军现正极力扩张和加强其防地。青岛西边的大港码头、南岸栈桥和团岛、东面的青岛山和湛山地区、北面台州镇登州路一带、沧口飞机场以及市内各较大建筑物等，皆早已为美军直接占领，划为美军防区和警戒区。原来唯一未被美军接防的市北白沙河水源地，最近亦由美军接防。青岛六、七个码头，美军占领了几乎一半。除原有飞机场由美军直接控制外，美军并计划增辟新机场。美军最近所要修建的从海岸直达飞机场的输油管，两旁皆由美军把守，使青岛唯一的陆上进口通路全被封闭。不久前来青的美第三十八特种混合舰队，原称于本月返美，现据合众社檀香山十八日电称亦已改变计划，“仍将留在中国沿海”。青岛原有美海军陆战队三四千人，美海军部最近又以“保护撤侨”为名宣布增派一千二百五十人来青。青岛海面上时常有美飞机军舰的实弹演习，附近燕儿岛常有美军实弹登陆演习，各山上时常是美军在练习所谓“保卫战”。国民党行政院已于十七日通过宣布青岛实行“临时戒严”，并强迫市民大量疏散。不顾职工的失业饥饿的危险，在青岛的国民党官僚资本已拟定工厂南逃的计划。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】国民党卖国政府又宣布成立一新的最高经济机构，以便利美帝国主义对国民党财政经济的全面控制。该机构名“经济配合委员会”，其“组织要点”已于二十日伪行政院临时会议中通过，规定由伪行政院长及财政、交通、工商、粮食四部部长、资源委员会委员长、中央银行总裁组成，而由美国经合总署直接监督之。其任务名义上是“配合美援、调节物资、稳定金融经济”。该“要点”中规定委员会及其所属之执行小组每次开会均须请经合分署代表出席。伪财政部长徐堪二十一日谈话中更无耻宣称：该会之成立“在中美经济合作方面可能创立一新里程碑”。与此同时，国民党ＣＣ报纸上海新闻报鼓吹对美采“门户大开放政策”，要“美英商业公司向华南和长江三角地区自由投资”，以便将这些地区的铁路、矿山以及内河航业全部送给美国和其他外国侵略者。
