[Jizhong Electric] Frontline reporters reported on the progress of our army's operations on the outskirts of Baoding, stating: After smashing the enemy's wild plan to invade Shijiazhuang in the Baoding South Blockade, our People's Liberation Army marched north and launched an offensive against the city gates of Baoding. After four days of fierce fighting, we completely occupied the four gates. On the evening of the 13th, the vanguard of our army began to press towards the outer strongholds of the enemy's South Gate of Baoding. Upon contact, the enemy fled in droves. That night, we completely captured eighteen strongholds including Qingbao, Fanzhuang, East and West Jiaozhuang, and Da and Xiao Hanjiang. At 6:30 p.m. on the 14th, we advanced towards the inner city ditch of the South Gate, engaging in a fierce battle with the bandit Bao 9th Regiment near the airport for about an hour. Under our repeated assaults, the enemy was unable to withstand and fled in disarray. Yang Defan, the commander of the bandit Bao 9th Regiment, was also killed in this battle. We then captured the airport. Subsequently, we launched attacks on strongholds such as Bali Village, East and West Machi, South Dayuan, Yaoshang, and Wulipu, and by 8:30 p.m., we had cleared all the outer strongholds of the South Gate. At a little after 10 p.m., we launched a general attack on the South Gate. The Second Company of the "Battlefront" unit braved the flanking and crossfire from the enemy's ditch-side pillboxes, bypassed the triangular bunker complex on the front of the inner city ditch, passed through a depression, and rushed towards the edge of the inner city ditch south of Tongren Middle School. Upon reaching the edge of the ditch, a barrage of thunderous grenades overwhelmed the firepower of the enemy's central pillbox. Due to the rapid actions of the Second and Third Platoons, it took less than twenty minutes from entering and exiting the ditch to eliminating the enemy and breaking through the front line. After opening the breach, our follow-up troops surged up like a tide. The "Battlefield" unit developed eastward, and with the powerful cooperation of our artillery, the large pillbox at the eastern end of the city ditch was eliminated in just fifteen minutes. Then, the spearhead was directed northeast, compressing inward. One part of the "Battleline" unit eliminated the large pillbox at the southwestern end of the city ditch and then developed in depth. After driving out the remaining enemies of Tongren Middle School, they joined the "Battlefield" unit to encircle and annihilate the enemy attempting to escape from the east and west. Because our army acted quickly and cooperated effectively, the enemy was unable to escape. More than 100 enemies were captured alive in the Coal Market Street on the south bank of the Fu River and the area east of Tongren Middle School. Those who ran a little faster mostly died under the sweep of our automatic weapons. The south bank of the Fu River was littered with enemy corpses. The "Battle Flag" unit, which advanced westward, made even more rapid progress. When they circled behind the enemy's south, the enemy suddenly woke up as if from a dream, but it was too late. An enemy platoon surrendered without much resistance. By 8:00 a.m. on the 15th, the South Gate was completely occupied by us, and there was no trace of the enemy south of the Fu River. At 6:30 a.m. on the 16th, fearing our attack on the city, the enemy inside the city, in a panic, used the supervisory team to press more than 100 enemies to counterattack our Da Nan Bridge. Under the heavy casualties caused by our strong artillery fire, the enemy abandoned more than 30 corpses and a light machine gun and fled in a hurry into the city. Our vanguard troops attacking the East Gate also forced back the strongholds of Xiaoyingfang and Da and Xiao Kangzhuang on the evening of the 13th. On the evening of the 13th, they continued to advance towards the East Gate and immediately occupied Yangzhuang, East and West Gaozhuang. Before dawn, the order for a general attack was issued. The Eighth Company of our "Brave" unit served as the assault team. Comrades Tian Lidong and Tao Changjiang, engineers, and Lei Xicai, a soldier of the Eighth Company, volunteered to carry out the explosion, using four large landmines weighing 26 kilograms each to blast open the inner city ditch wall of West Gaozhuang, opening a way forward for the follow-up troops. Immediately afterwards, Chu Feng, the instructor of the Third Battalion, and Zhang Youfu, the commander of the Eighth Company, took the lead and led the troops into the enemy's陣. After our follow-up troops rushed into the city ditch, they advanced in two ways, north and south. The one advancing north was the "Warrior" unit. Under the leadership of Vice Regiment Commander ×, they engaged in a battle with the enemy to seize bunkers one by one. By 7:00 a.m. on the 15th, the unit had occupied Wangjia Hutong and continued to press towards the East Gate. At dusk, the enemy fled in disarray, and the outside of the moat was completely under our control. After opening the breach, the "Brave" unit quickly advanced south and by 6:00 a.m. on the 15th, it had completely occupied Xinzha. After clearing the enemy, they braved the enemy's fierce artillery fire and began to attack the enemy guarding the electric light company. The enemy relied on its favorable terrain and strong fortifications to organize mobile firepower to stubbornly resist us. However, under the cover of firepower, our army built fortifications in front of the enemy, driving in nails, and confronted the enemy for two days and nights. Until 2:30 a.m. before dawn on the 18th, we launched another attack. By 4:00 a.m., none of the defenders of one company escaped and were all annihilated by us. The enemies at the North Gate were even more lax. As soon as they saw our army arrive, they abandoned their bunkers and fled south, daring not to fight. However, on the 16th, although the enemy launched three counterattacks, they were all repulsed by us. On the 18th, the enemies at the North Gate entered the isolated bunkers of the east and west stations of the city through tunnels and stubbornly resisted us. By 6:00 p.m., they were all eliminated by us. The unit of our army attacking the West Gate occupied most of the West Gate at 1:00 a.m. on the 16th. However, the remaining hundred or so enemies of Hebei University and the automobile repair company relied on fortifications and used automatic weapons to form a mobile fire net to stubbornly resist us. After a fierce battle, at 5:00 p.m. on the same day, under our fierce artillery encirclement and attack, the enemies, except for a part who fled, were all killed, wounded and captured by us.

    【冀中电】前线记者报导我军保定外围作战经过称。我人民解放军，自保南阻击战粉碎了敌人企图侵扰我石家庄的狂妄计划后，即挥师北上，向保定城关发动攻势。经四日激战，完全占领四关。十三日晚，我军前进部即开始向保定南关敌外围据点进逼，一经接触敌即纷纷逃窜。当晚即将青堡、樊庄、东、西焦庄并大小韩蒋等十八个碉点完全攻克。十四日晚六点半，又向南关内市沟方向推进，在飞机场与匪保九团激战约一小时左右，在我反复冲杀下，敌人不支，狼狈逃窜。匪保九团团长杨德藩亦于是役被我击毙。我当将机场攻克。随后又向八里庄、东西马池、南大园、窑上、五里铺等据点展开攻击，于八点半即将南关外围据点悉数扫清。十点多钟，我对南关开始总攻，战线部二连则冒着敌沟沿碉堡的侧射交叉火力，绕过内市沟前沿的三角地堡群，通过一块凹地，向同仁中学南边之内市沟的边缘急进，到达沟沿，一阵飞雷手榴弹，就将敌中心碉堡上的火力压倒了，由于二、三班动作迅速，从上下沟到解决敌人突破前沿为时还不到二十分钟。打开突破口后，我后续部队就如潮水似的拥了上去。“战场”部向东发展，在我炮兵的有力配合下，仅仅十五分钟，就解决了市沟东端之大碉堡，于是矛头又直向东北，向内压缩。“战线”部一部解决了市沟西南端之大稠堡后，即向纵深发展，他们将同仁中学的残敌驱逐后，即会同“战场”部东西钳击企图逃窜之敌，因我军动作迅速，配合得力，使敌人无法逃窜，仅在府河南岸煤市街与同仁中学以东地区，就活捉敌人一百多，有些跑的稍快点的，也大部丧命在我自动火器的扫射下，府河南岸敌死尸累累。向西推进的“战旗”部进展更为神速，当他们绕到南敌人的背后时，敌人才如梦初醒，但已来不及了，敌人一个排，没经什么激战就都缴了械。至十五号早八点南关已全部为我占领，府河以南已无敌踪。十六号早六点半，城内敌人恐我攻城，惊慌之余，复以督战队压阵，驱逐百余敌人向我大南桥反突。在我强烈炮火的杀伤下，敌遗弃三十余具尸体、一挺轻械枪，即怆皇窜入城内。攻击东关的我前卫部队，亦于十三日晚迫退小营房、大小康庄等碉点。十三日晚又续向东关推进，随即占领杨庄东西高庄。拂晓前总攻击令下，我“勇敢”部八连为突击队，工兵田立冬、陶长江及八连战士雷喜才三同志自告奋勇，担任爆炸，以二十六斤的四个大地雷连轰开了西高庄的内市沟壁，为后续部队打开了一前进的道路。紧接着三营教导员楚封，及八连连长张有福二同志，即身先士卒，带领部队冲入敌阵。我后续部队冲入市沟后，即分南北两路前进，往北推进的一路是“勇士”部，他们在×副团长的率领下，与敌展开逐碉争夺战，到十五号早七点，该部将王家胡同占领，继续向东关迫进，黄昏时分，敌人狼狈逃窜，护城河外，则全部为我控制。“勇敢”部从打开突破口后，迅速向南推进，到十五号早六点，即全部占领新闸。肃清敌人后，又冒着敌猛烈炮火，即向电灯公司守敌开始冲击，敌依其有利地形与坚强工事，组织机动火器向我顽抗。但我军在火力掩护下，即在敌前构筑工事，钉好钉子，与敌对峙达两昼夜，直至十八号拂晓前两点半，我又开始攻击，至四点，守敌一个连无一漏网，全部为我歼灭。北关的敌人更松，一见我大军开到，即弃碉南逃，不敢交战。惟十六日那天，敌人虽曾三次反突，但均被我打退，十八日北关敌人，又从地道进入城东西两站之孤碉与我顽抗，至下午六点，全部为我拔除。攻打西关我军某部，十六号早一点钟，即将西关大部占领，惟河北大学及汽车修理公司的百余残敌，依据工事，以自动火器组成机动火网，向我顽抗，经一场激战后，于当日下午五点，在我猛烈火力围攻下，敌人除一部逃窜外，则全部为我毙伤和俘虏。
