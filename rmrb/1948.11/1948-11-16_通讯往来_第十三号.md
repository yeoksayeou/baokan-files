Communications and Exchanges

To all Regional Committee and County Committee Offices, all base-point work teams, and comrade correspondents:

We have received your winter work plans and deployment situations, work briefings, summaries of land reform conclusions in experimental villages, etc., which are currently under review. In addition to hoping you will continue to contribute, we hope you can quickly continue to report on the implementation of the plans. In the land reform and party rectification work, what are some different specific situations? Can the guiding principles and plans be implemented? Or what needs to be modified? In each stage of the work process (such as revising composition, supplementary allocation, issuing land certificates, preliminary rectification of branches, etc.), what new deviations and difficulties have been encountered? How were they resolved? What achievements and experiences have been gained? What are the changes in the ideological sentiments of the masses at each stage of the work? In winter production work, what are the different situations in disaster areas and non-disaster areas? How to organize the masses to carry out sideline and handicraft production? How to prepare for next year's large-scale production (such as accumulating fertilizer, building water conservancy projects, repairing farm tools, animal husbandry, afforestation, etc.), what organizational forms were used? What are the achievements? What are the differences from previous winter production? What have the cooperatives done in winter production? How do state-owned stores and trade departments serve production? What ideological problems still exist among the masses? We hope to report specifically on all of these. We also hope that you will send us a copy of your temporary situation issues and work reports to higher authorities.
