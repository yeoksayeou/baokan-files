　　Old opera must be reformed. In the North China Liberated Area, according to preliminary investigations, there are more than twenty types of opera including Peking Opera, Hebei Bangzi, Ping Opera, various Shanxi Bangzi, Qin Opera, Yangko, Liuzidiao, Old Tune, Sixian, High Tune, and Daoqing. The vast majority of them still contain old feudal content and have not undergone necessary reforms. In rural areas, although new-style rural troupes are quite common, and although peasants like to watch new operas and even perform them themselves, the broad masses of peasants still love old operas. Whenever there are country fairs or temple festivals with old opera performances, the audience is very crowded, with some people even traveling dozens of miles to see the show, which becomes a major event in the lives of the peasants. In cities, old opera maintains a fairly fixed audience more frequently. In Shijiazhuang alone, there are six or seven old opera theaters, with a daily audience of tens of thousands. Among the various old operas, Peking Opera is the most popular and has the greatest influence. Although we have carried out some reform work on Peking Opera and other old operas, this work has not been sufficient. Various old opera programs are often performed everywhere without restriction or criticism, spreading poison in the minds of the broad masses, which violates the direction of new democratic cultural construction and must be changed. Now, with the rapid development of the victorious situation of the People's Liberation War and the successive liberation of large cities, the task of old opera reform has been brought to our attention even more urgently and needs to be seriously addressed.
    Reforming old opera is a historical task. The "May Fourth" New Culture Movement initially raised the issue of reforming old opera. Later, some drama workers successively did a lot of work to improve old opera and achieved certain results, but due to historical, social, and political constraints, this problem was not fundamentally solved. In the liberated areas, although a lot of work has also been done to reform old opera, and new Peking Operas such as "Driven to Join the Liangshan Rebels" and "Three Attacks on Zhu Village", and new Qin Operas such as "Blood and Tears of仇" have been produced, the development of a broad mass-based new Yangko movement was particularly effective. However, due to the limitations of manpower and material resources in the dispersed guerrilla warfare environment in the countryside at that time, it was still impossible to fundamentally solve the problem of old opera reform. Now, the North China People's Government has organized the North China Drama and Music Work Committee to preside over the entire North China drama and music work. Currently, the focus is on reforming old opera, starting with Peking Opera, and carrying out review, modification, and writing work. This is a promising start to carry out old opera reform in a planned, systematic, and relatively large-scale manner. This is something to be excited about and celebrated.
    When starting to reform old opera, we must first have a correct attitude towards old opera. There are several incorrect attitudes: One is to emphasize that the masses like old opera and cadres need entertainment, and to advocate performing old opera everywhere, blindly and unprincipledly supporting old opera troupes. Some places even use the excuse of prospering the market or simply taking care of the theater's profits to allow some programs that should not be performed to be staged. Some cadres arbitrarily order the performance of programs that the general public considers harmful, thinking that there is no harm for cadres to watch them, causing extremely bad influence among the masses. Individual troops and local organs even turn un-reformed old opera troupes into organ troops troupes, as a tool for pure entertainment. All of this is wrong and must be corrected. Another attitude is that some comrades deeply hate old opera and advocate a blanket ban, which is also wrong, because they only see the harmful aspects of old opera, but not its mass character and some of its good and reasonable parts. Moreover, no matter what, anything related to the hobbies and habits of millions of people cannot be solved by administrative orders. Still another attitude is that some literary and art workers do not ask or hear about old opera. What they care about and are interested in is the so-called "advanced" literature and art in their minds. As for old opera, although it is a matter of concern to millions of people, in their view, it is too low-level and they are not willing to intervene. This attitude is naturally also wrong.
    Old opera is one of the important heritages of Chinese national art. It is a product of feudal society, but just as all cultural arts of the past contain more or less democratic elements, old opera also contains some positive democratic elements. Moreover, it is in all the arts that it has the closest relationship with the broad masses. Also, because the history of the development of new opera is still short, and it still has shortcomings in itself, it has not yet taken root in the masses, while old opera maintains a deep foundation in the masses. Therefore, reforming old opera is a very important task and also a very complex ideological struggle. We can only adopt a positive reform approach to old opera. Here, any simple administrative orders or acute illness cannot solve the problem.
    The first step in reforming old opera should be to review and approve old opera programs and distinguish between good and bad. First of all, we must determine the criteria for review. We must decide on acceptance or rejection based on whether it is beneficial or harmful to the people. Those that are beneficial to the people or have more benefits than harm should be promoted and promoted, or their disadvantages should be eliminated and their advantages taken while making some modifications. Those that are absolutely harmful to the people or have more harm than benefits should be banned or greatly modified. In the current content of old opera, it can be roughly divided into three categories: beneficial, harmful, and harmless. We should study them specifically and treat them differently.
    First, there are the beneficial parts, which are the rational parts of the old opera heritage and must be promoted. This includes everything that expresses resistance to feudal oppression and corrupt officials (such as "Anti-Xuzhou", "Killing the Family at the Fishing Village", etc.), praises national integrity (such as "Su Wu Herding Sheep", "Shi Kefa Defending Yangzhou", etc.), exposes and satirizes the internal relations of the ruling class (such as "Four Jinshi", "Empress He Scolding the Palace", etc.), opposes the behavior of local bullies (such as "Fei Degong", "Asking the Woodcutter"), as well as anti-feudal family oppression, praise for marital autonomy, enthusiasm for public welfare, and diligence in starting a family.
    Second, there are the harmless parts, such as many historical story operas (such as "Heroes' Meeting", "Ancient City Meeting", "Su He Chasing Han Xin by Moonlight Night", etc.). Although they are not of much benefit to the masses, they are also harmless. From these plays, we can also obtain a lot of historical knowledge and historical lessons, inspire and increase our wisdom.
    Third, there are the harmful parts, including everything that promotes feudal oppression and slave morality (such as "Nine O'Clock", "Cui Ping Mountain", etc.), promotes national integrity (such as "Si Lang Visiting His Mother"), promotes superstition and ignorance (such as the appearance of gods and ghosts on the stage, emphasizing the propaganda that gods are the masters of life, etc., as for general fairy tales, such as the play of Sun Wukong Making Havoc in Heaven, it can be performed), as well as everything that promotes licentiousness, pleasure, and pornography (such as "Youlong Play Phoenix", "Drunkenness", etc.). These plays should be banned or allowed to be performed only after major modifications.
    The first and second types of programs can be performed without modification or with slight modification. The second type especially accounts for the vast majority of old opera programs. In terms of modification objects, in addition to old opera, we should pay special attention to the reform of local opera. There are many programs of various local operas, and they should be collected in a planned and organized manner. Many of these plays are passed down orally and remain in the minds of old opera performers. They should be recorded, studied, reviewed, and modified. The excavation of this part of the heritage will be extremely valuable for the reform and construction of China's national new opera.
    Reforming old opera, reviewing and approving programs is of course only the first step. The real work is modification and creation, and modification is the main one. This is not only to meet the current urgent needs, but also because old opera contains many things in the legacy of national art that still have life today, and parts that are beneficial to the people, which must be critically accepted. Our methods of modification and creation must be historical materialism. We should first reverse the historical facts that have been distorted by the ruling class and restore the original appearance of history (such as adapting "Chuangwang Uprising", etc.), but the expression of all historical figures and events must and can only proceed from the conditions permitted by the historical environment at that time, and not from modern conditions. We objectively observe and express historical events and figures from the modern proletarian point of view, rather than dyeing historical events and figures with modern colors.
    The reform of old opera depends on the close cooperation of new literary and art workers and old artists. New literary and art workers have the responsibility to guide and actually participate in the work of old opera reform; at the same time, they must patiently unite and help those old artists to conduct joint research and jointly transform, and conduct experiments in their practice, and gradually seek perfection.
    The reform of old opera is related to the ideological education of millions of people and to the future of the creation of national new opera. It is a problem that needs to be solved urgently in the construction of new democratic culture and art. We must carry out this work with the greatest enthusiasm and determination and with great caution. As long as we persist in our efforts for a certain period of time, we will inevitably achieve great results in continuous improvement.

### 有计划有步骤地进行旧剧改革工作

　　有计划有步骤地进行旧剧改革工作
    旧剧必须改革。在华北解放区，据初步调查，有平剧、河北梆子、评戏、各路山西梆子、秦腔、秧歌、柳子调、老调、丝弦、高调、道情等二十余种，它们绝大部分还是旧的封建的内容，没有经过一定的必要的改造。在农村中，虽然新型的农村剧团已经相当普遍，虽然农民喜欢看新戏，自己还会演新戏，但广大农民对旧戏还是喜爱的，每逢赶集赶庙唱旧戏的时候，观众十分拥挤，有的竟从数十里以外赶来看戏，成为农民生活中的重大事件。在城市中，旧剧更经常保持相当固定的观众，石家庄一处就有六七个旧剧院，每天观众达万人。各种旧剧中，又以平剧流行最广，影响最大。我们虽然对于平剧及其他各种旧剧进行了若干改革的工作，但这个工作是做得非常不够的。旧剧的各种节目，往往不受限制、不加批判地，任其到处上演，在广大群众的思想中传播毒素，这种现象，是与新民主主义文化建设的方向相违反的，是必须改变的。现在人民解放战争胜利形势飞跃发展，大城市相继被解放，旧剧改革的任务便更急迫地提到我们面前，需要我们认真地加以解决。
    改革旧剧是一个历史的任务。“五四”新文化运动一开始就提出了改革旧剧的问题，后来一部分戏剧工作者陆陆续续做了不少旧剧改良的工作，而且获得一定成绩，但因为历史的、社会的与政治的种种条件的限制，没有根本解决这个问题。在解放区，对旧剧的改革虽然也作了不少工作，并且产生了“逼上梁山”、“三打祝家庄”一类的新平剧，“血泪仇”一类的新秦腔，特别有成效的，是开展了广大群众性的新秧歌运动，但由于当时处在农村的分散的游击战争环境，人力物力条件的限制，仍然没有可能根本解决旧剧改革的问题。现在华北人民政府组织华北戏剧音乐工作委员会，以主持整个华北戏剧音乐的工作，目前并以改革旧剧为重点，从平剧开始，进行审查修改编写工作，这是有计划、有系统地、比较大规模地进行旧剧改革的一个有希望的开端，这是值得兴奋、值得庆贺的一件事情。
    着手改革旧剧，首先必须对于旧剧有一个正确的态度。有几种态度是不正确的：一种是强调群众喜爱旧戏，干部需要娱乐，到处鼓吹演旧剧，盲目地、无原则地支持旧戏班；有的地方竟借口繁荣市面，或单纯照顾戏院的营利而使一些不应上演的节目得到上演；有的干部任意点演一般群众都认为有害的节目，自以为干部看看没有什么妨碍，在群众中造成极端恶劣的影响；个别部队、地方机关甚至将未经改造的旧戏班变成机关部队剧团，作为单纯娱乐的工具；这一切都是错误的，必须纠正。另一种态度则是有些同志对旧戏深恶痛绝，主张一律禁止，这也是错误的，因为他只看到旧剧有害的方面，而没有看到它的群众性与它还有一些好的合理的部分，而且不论怎样，凡是关系到千百万群众所爱好与习惯的事物，都不是采取行政命令办法所能解决。再一种态度，就是有些文艺工作者对旧剧不问不闻，他所关心与感到兴趣的只是他心目中的所谓“高级”文艺，至于旧剧呢，虽然关系千万人的事情，但在他看来，低级得很，他是不屑于去过问的，这种态度自然也是错误的。
    旧剧是中国民族艺术重要遗产之一，它是封建社会的产物，但正如一切过去时代的文化艺术都含有或多或少的民主因素一样，旧剧也含有若干积极的民主的因素，而且它是在一切艺术中和广大群众最有密切联系的；又由于新剧发展的历史还短，本身尚有缺点，在群众中还没有完全生根，而旧剧在群众中则保持着深厚的基础，因此改造旧剧是一个非常重要的任务，也是一个非常复杂的思想斗争。对于旧剧只能采取积极改革的方针，在这里，任何单纯行政命令或急性病都是不能解决问题的。
    改革旧剧的第一步工作，应该是审定旧剧目，分清好坏。首先，我们必须确定审查的标准。我们要以对人民的有利或有害决定取舍。对人民有利或者利多害少的，则加以发扬和推广，或者去弊取利而加以若干修改；对人民绝对有害或害多利少的，则应加以禁演或大大修改。在现有旧剧内容中，大体上可以分成有利有害与无害三大类，应具体研究，分别对待。
    第一，是有利的部分，这是旧剧遗产的合理部分，必须加以发扬。这包括一切表现反抗封建压迫，反抗贪官污吏的（如“反徐州”、“打渔杀家”等），歌颂民族气节的（如“苏武牧羊”、“史可法守扬州”等），暴露与讽刺统治阶级内部关系的（如“四进士”、“贺后骂殿”等），反对恶霸行为的（如“费德功”、“问樵”），以及反封家庭压迫，歌颂婚姻自主，急公好义，勤俭起家的剧目。
    第二，是无害的部分，如很多历史故事戏（如“群英会”、“古城会”、“肃何月夜追韩信”等），对群众虽无多大益处，但也无害处，从这些戏里还可获得不少历史知识与历史教训，启发与增加我们的智慧。
    第三，有害的部分，包括一切提倡封建压迫奴隶道德的（如“九更天”、“翠屏山”等），提倡民族失节的（如“四郎探母”），提倡迷信愚昧的（如舞台上神鬼出现，强调宣传神仙是人生主宰者等等，至于一般神话故事，如孙悟空大闹天空的戏，则是可以演的），以及一切提倡淫乱享乐与色情的（如“游龙戏凤”、“醉酒”等），这些戏应该加以禁演或经过重大修改后方准演出。
    第一与第二类节目都是不加修改或稍加修改即可演出的，第二类尤其占旧剧目中的极大部分。在修改对象上，除了旧剧以外，应当特别着重地方戏的改革。各种地方戏的剧目是很多的，应当有计划有组织地加以搜集，这些戏许多是口头传授的，保留在旧剧人的脑子里，应当把它们记录下来，加以研究审定与修改。这部分遗产的发掘，对于改革与建设中国民族的新歌剧，将是极为珍贵的。
    改革旧剧，审定剧目当然还只是第一步工作，真正的工作是修改与创作，而修改又是主要的，这不只为了应付目前的急需，而且也因为旧剧包含了民族艺术遗留中不少至今还有生命的东西，与对人民有利的部分，必须批判地加以接受。我们修改与创作的方法必须是历史唯物主义的。我们首先应该对那些被统治阶级歪曲了的历史事实加以翻案，恢复历史的本来面目（如改编“闯王起义”等），但表现一切历史人物和事件都必须而且只能从当时历史环境所许可的条件出发，而不能从现代的条件出发。我们是从现代无产阶级的观点来客观地观察与表现历史的事件与人物，而不是将历史的事件与人物染上现代的色彩。
    旧剧的改革有赖新文艺工作者与旧艺人的通力合作。新文艺工作者有责任指导与实际参加旧剧改革的工作；同时还要耐心地团结与帮助那些旧艺人共同研究，合力改造，并在他们实践中进行试验，逐步求得完善。
    旧剧改革关系到千百万群众的思想教育，关系到民族新歌剧的创造前途，它是新民主主义文化艺术的建设工作中急待解决的问题。我们要以最大热情与决心，十分慎重地来进行这一工作。只要经过一定时期的坚持努力，必然会在不断的改进中获得巨大的成绩。
