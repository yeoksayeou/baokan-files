【Taihang News】Changzhi City has formally established a remedial school to meet the learning needs of urban staff and shop assistants, and to improve mass culture. The city first conducted a thorough review of past educational work for staff and shop assistants. The main shortcomings in the past were: 1. Running clubs without understanding the urgent needs of staff and shop assistants, turning clubs into purely recreational venues and neglecting cultural education. 2. Solely emphasizing ideological breakthroughs, reviews, and self-reflection, without integrating ideological education with cultural learning. 3. Failing to determine different organizational forms based on different objects, causing students to see learning as a burden, remaining illiterate year after year. Based on the above shortcomings, targeting the needs of staff and shop assistants, and future requirements, the city determined the guiding principle for running the school this time: focusing on improving the cultural level of staff and shop assistants, while implementing New Democratic economic policies, ideological education, improving business skills, and enhancing skills, to achieve the goals of developing production, prospering the economy, benefiting both public and private sectors, and benefiting both labor and capital. The city also changed the previous organizational forms and educational content, conducting education according to different objects. Breaking the practice of compulsory collective organization, the city adopted an open enrollment and voluntary registration approach. As a result, enrollment was very enthusiastic after public calls and the posting of advertisements. In order to align the learning attitudes and ideological viewpoints of managers and shop assistants, separate meetings were held for managers and shop assistants to resolve misunderstandings and share thoughts. At the managers' meeting, the relationship between learning and industry and commerce was resolved. Everyone understood that if industry and commerce were to develop and make money, there must be talent. Today, shop assistants can get learning opportunities, improve their culture, and learn skills, which is a good thing. At the shop assistants' meeting, through everyone sharing their thoughts, it was discovered that the fear of being "fired" had become a burden hindering learning. Through casual talks and research, everyone clarified ideologically that only by studying hard, working hard, and improving themselves can their jobs be consolidated. In larger stores, there are many shop assistants, and if everyone goes to study, the counter will be too busy. If they are not allowed to go together, everyone is afraid of being left behind. At this time, the cadres came up with an idea for them, explaining that our school runs a term every three months, and you can take turns participating in different terms, and the problem was also resolved. By clarifying the purpose of learning, overcoming the erroneous idea that going to school is a burden, and correcting the attitude towards going to school, everyone's enthusiasm was very high. For example, Gao Hui, a shop assistant at the Changjiang Store, said when registering: "Although there is only me at our counter, I guarantee that I will not delay the counter's work, and I must learn skills." Liu Fugui, the manager of Tianshenghe on South Street, personally took a shop assistant to the school to register. The manager of the Mass Cooperative, who was of worker-peasant origin, did not understand the situation, but was eager to learn, and fearing that the school would not allow managers to participate, changed his job title to register. In three days, 82 people registered, including 4 high school graduates, 54 with four years of elementary school, 23 with three to one years of elementary school, and 1 illiterate person. The vast majority are shop assistants, with 4 managers and 1 vendor. Their requirements: 59 people to learn culture and abacus, 10 people to learn bookkeeping, 12 people to learn industrial and commercial policies and current affairs, and 1 person to learn accounting. After the exam, they were divided into three classes according to their grades. Based on the students' entry requirements and levels, a three-month education plan was formulated: 1. Those with a high cultural level should learn to write announcements, publish advertisements, and read the *New Masses Daily*. 2. Upon graduation from the lower-level class, they should be able to write simple receipts and invoices. 3. Arithmetic: The advanced class should learn multiplication and division and calculate simple interest, and the lower level should learn addition and subtraction, and strive to learn multiplication.
    Classes are held every three, six, and nine afternoons from 8:30 PM to 10:30 PM. All other times are devoted to self-study in conjunction with business at work. It is stipulated that diaries should be submitted five times a month, and large characters four times. The school's charter was also democratically formulated.

　　满足职工店员学习要求
  　长治市成立补习学校
    【太行讯】长治市正式成立补习学校，以满足城市职工店员学习要求，提高大众文化。该市首先对已往职工店员的教育工作做了深刻检查。过去主要缺点是：一、办俱乐部，不了解职工店员的迫切要求，俱乐部变成了单纯的娱乐场所，忽视了文化教育。二、单纯强调打通思想，检讨反省，思想教育没有和文化学习相结合。三、没有根据不同的对象来决定不同的组织形式，致使学员把学习看成负担，年年学习，年年是文盲。根据以上的缺点，针对着职工店员的要求，和今后的需要，确定了这次办学的方针：以提高职工店员文化水平为主，同时贯彻新民主主义经济政策思想教育，改进业务，提高技能，达到发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利的目的。并改变已往的组织形式与教育内容，分别对象进行教育。打破强迫命令集体编制的做法，采取公开招生自愿报名的方式。结果一公开号召与张贴广告，报名学员非常踊跃。为了使经理与店员学习态度思想观点取得一致，便分头召开了经理，店员会议，使互相解了疙＠，谈了心思。经理会议上解决了学习与工商业的关系，大家谈明白了，想要工商业发展，买卖赚钱，必须有人材，今天店员伙计能得到学习机会，提高文化，学习本事，这是一件好事。店员会上，通过大家谈心思，发现怕“打锅”（开除）思想成了妨碍学习的包袱。通过漫谈、研究，大家思想上明确了：只有加油学习，努力工作、提高自己，工作才会巩固。较大的商店，店员多，都去学习柜上又忙不过来，不让一齐去，又怕落下谁谁也不愿意。这时，干部又给他们出了主意，说明咱们学校是三个月办一期，可以轮流分期参加，问题也得到了解决。明确了学习的目的，克服了上学是负担的错误思想，端正了上学的态度，大家情绪非常高涨。如长江商店店员高会在报名时说：“我们柜上虽只我一人，我保证不耽误柜上活儿，还一定要学下本事。”南街天盛和经理刘富贵，亲自拉着小店员前往学校去报名。群众合作社工农出身的经理，因不了解情况，又要急于学习，怕学校不叫经理参加，便改了职别去报名。三天工夫即有八十二人报名，内有高小肄业的四人，初小四年的五十四人，三年至一年的廿三人，一字不识的一人。绝大部分是店员，另有经理四人，摊贩一人。他们的要求：学文化、珠算的五十九人，学簿记的十人，学工商政策与时事的十二人，学记帐的一人。经过考试，按成绩的好坏编为三个班。根据学员入学要求及程度订出了今后三个月教育计划：一、文化程度高的，要学会写启示，出广告，看下新大众报。二、低级班毕业时，达到会写简单收据、发票。三、算术：高级班学会乘除及算简单利息，低级学会加减，争取学会乘法。
    上课时间每逢三六九下午八时半至十时半，其余时间一律在工作岗位上结合业务进行自修。规定每月交日记五次，大楷四次。并经民主制订学校公约。（长治市一完小通讯组、力发执笔）
