　　Crimes Deserving More Than Death
  　Chiang Kai-shek's Bandits in Baoding Indiscriminately Sabotage Before Fleeing, Burning and Destroying Factories, Schools, and Hospitals
    [Baoding Electric Dispatch] Before fleeing Baoding city, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits carried out large-scale looting and destruction in the city. The water tower, bridge, and electric company at the Xiguan Railway Station, as well as the Qianyi Flour Company, the essence of Baoding's industry, and buildings such as Hebei University, the Army Hospital, and the Match Company, were all blown up or set on fire by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. They also looted the property of citizens and institutions, disrupting urban order. The citizens suffered greatly. Our military control commission is comforting merchants and residents and investigating the instigators and perpetrators of the sabotage.
    [Baoding Electric Dispatch] Frontline reporter Liuxin reports: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army demonstrated excellent discipline during the siege of Baoding, winning the support and praise of the vast majority of citizens. On the evening of November 14th, the "Battle Flag Unit" entered Nanguan. To protect the Catholic Church and its affiliated Catholic Hospital, they set up their camp headquarters in the original reception room of the hospital. In addition to posting sentries at the door, the cadres personally supervised and inspected the hospital's supplies and buildings. Until the end of the battle, not a single pane of glass in the hospital windows was damaged, and the teapots, teacups, and all utensils on the tables remained untouched. The hospital负责人 gratefully said, "They (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's bandits) came and grabbed and roamed around, but you came and were well-behaved. There is a world of difference between the two armies!" After the "Battle Line Unit" entered Tongren Middle School, they first explained to the school's faculty and staff our army's policy of protecting schools and immediately sent people to guard or temporarily seal off classrooms, books, instruments, etc., one by one. When the reporter visited the school, all the materials were intact, and chrysanthemums were blooming indoors. Director Ma happily said, "I knew you would be coming soon, so the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the Education Department ordered me several times to move the students into the city, but I didn't do it." He also said, "It's good that you came! We are willing to start school and resume classes as soon as possible." After the "Battle Line Unit" occupied the enemy's military warehouse, boxes of biscuits were piled up in the room. The soldiers, despite being hungry after fighting all night, didn't touch a single piece. One battalion of the unit, preferring to confront the enemy while hauling back firewood from the enemy's fortifications they had already captured to boil water themselves, would never use a bit of the people's firewood. They knew that under Chiang Kai-shek's rule and oppression, even a little firewood was precious to the masses. These exemplary deeds of the People's Liberation Army deeply moved the hearts of the vast majority of citizens. An old lady told the reporter, "If everyone in the world were as good as you, that would be great."

　　罪不容诛
  　保定蒋匪逃窜前滥施破坏  竟焚烧炸毁工厂学校医院
    【保定电】保定城蒋匪逃窜前，对该城曾大肆抢劫与破坏。西关车站的水塔、大桥、电灯公司及保定工业精华的乾义面粉公司，及河北大学、陆军医院、火柴公司等建筑，均遭蒋匪炸毁或纵火焚烧，并大肆抢劫市民、机关资财，破坏城市秩序。市民受害甚大。我军管会正安抚商民，调查破坏罪行的主使者和执行者。
    【保定电】前线记者留心报导：人民解放军某部，在围攻保定战役中，纪律甚为良好，博得广大市民的拥护与赞扬。十一月十四日晚，“战旗部”攻入南关，为保护天主教堂及其所属之公教医院，将营部设在医院的原来传达室内，除门口站岗外，干部还亲自看管，检查该院物资与建筑。直到战斗结束，医院窗子上的玻璃，没有一块被损坏，桌子上的茶壶茶碗和一切用具，皆原封未动，该院负责人感激的说：“他们（指蒋匪）来了乱抓乱串，你们来了规规矩矩，两军相比，真有天地之别！”“战线部”进入同仁中学后，首先向该校教职员讲解了我军保护学校的政策，对其教室、图书仪器等，即派人一一看管或临时加封。当记者走访该校时，全部物资完整无损，菊花在屋内盛开。马教务主任快乐的说：“我知道你们不久就要到来，所以教育厅蒋匪数令我带学生们搬进城内，均未照办”又说：“你们来了好！我们愿早日开学复课。”“战线部”攻占敌人军用仓库后，成箱饼干堆集在屋里，战士们在彻夜战斗后的饥饿情况下，都没人动一片。该部一营，宁愿一面与敌人对峙，一面从已经攻克的敌人工事上弄回鹿柴自己烧水，也决不动用老百姓一点烧柴，他们知道：在蒋匪统治压榨下，群众的一点烧柴都是可贵的。解放军这些模范事迹，深深感动了广大市民的心，一个老太太告诉记者：“普天下的人心，要是都象你们一样好，那就好了。”
