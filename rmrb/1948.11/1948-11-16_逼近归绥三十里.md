Approaching Guisui Thirty Li
	Guo Feng

The People's Liberation Army, in several routes, braved the drizzling rain and marched north across the muddy grassland. Suddenly, a whistle sounded from the north, "Woo... woo!" Everyone looked up and saw the Daqing Mountains lying across the front. A white smoke was being drawn on the mountainside. Soldier Wu Yugen shouted, "A ticket! A train is coming." Then he imitated the sound of the train's engine: "Qi Deng Kang Deng! Suiyuan Datong! Qi Deng Kang Deng! Not through, not through!" causing everyone to burst into laughter. The soldiers seemed particularly excited today and walked much more lightly.

The train was traveling from Baotou to Guisui. On September 27th, our army entered Liujiaying, only thirty li from Guisui, the capital of Suiyuan Province. Along the way, we did not encounter any resistance from the bandit Fu troops.

Twenty li north of Guisui city are the Daqing Mountains. Looking south, a faint mountain range is vaguely visible on the distant horizon. To the east and west, there is an endless prairie. Having walked through the continuous peaks of northern Shanxi, the sight of this vast plain immediately makes one feel open-minded.

When our army first entered the area ruled by the Fu bandits, we constantly saw bloody slogans along the way: "Empty the houses and clear the fields, those who don't run will be killed." At that time, our army was very worried that the people in the vicinity of Guisui would be afraid to approach our army due to the long-term deception and threats of the Fu bandits. But the opposite was true. Not only did the people here not run, but they also gave our army enthusiastic support. They helped us grind the newly harvested grain to remove the husks, and they provided us with warm houses and heated kang beds. The landlord, Old Man Wu, gently closed the door after we went to sleep. All these thoughtful cares in minor matters made us deeply experience the love of the people in the new area for the People's Liberation Army.

The first day we marched to Zhongqi Village, seventy li from the city, to rest. We saw that every household's field and courtyard were piled with newly harvested crops. When the common people saw us stop, they immediately gathered around to chat with us. When we asked for directions, they told us clearly how far it was from this village to that village, and told us that the tomb of Zhaojun was only forty li further on, as if we were not here to fight, but to travel. I jokingly asked a strong young man named Peng Sitong: "Are you afraid of the People's Liberation Army?" He smiled and said, "Afraid of what? We have long known that the People's Liberation Army doesn't beat or scold people, and treats the common people well. You came here two years ago, wearing gray uniforms. In one night, you disarmed the puppet Mongolian soldiers in the stronghold here. A squad lived in my yard, and they were kind and harmonious, sweeping the yard, carrying water, and paying for the grain and firewood they used. After the troops left, many animals came here carrying goods to sell, matches, white cloth, cotton thread, and they only accepted border area currency. The goods were cheaper than if we bought them with grain!" Old Man Wu of Liujiaying also talked about this, saying: "The People's Liberation Army always thinks of the common people and is always afraid that the common people will suffer losses. Chiang Kai-shek doesn't care about that, and issues tickets indiscriminately..." As he spoke, he took out a 10,000-yuan legal tender note from his waist and showed it to me: "Isn't this just a piece of waste paper! What can you buy with it? If you really take it to buy something, you can only buy one and a half cotton threads!"

This year Suiyuan had a bumper harvest, but the lives of the common people are still very hard. Because this place was scoured by the waters of the Heihe River for three years, and no grain was harvested for the past three years, but the greedy and insatiable Fu bandits still forced the people to hand over grain and money, and the people had to sell their livestock and furniture. The people here have not worn new clothes for three or five years. We gave them a pair of broken shoes, and they were so grateful that they didn't know what to say.

In the fertile land of Suiyuan, in the years of bumper harvests, the areas ruled by the Fu bandits are full of hungry people everywhere. They know that only when the People's Liberation Army arrives will there be a real bumper harvest—a harvest that belongs to them. They welcome the People's Liberation Army and hope that the People's Liberation Army will capture Guisui city as soon as possible.

　　逼近归绥三十里
    郭锋
    解放军数路大兵冒着蒙蒙细雨，踏着泥泞草原，向北行进。忽听北边“呜…呜！”响了一声汽笛，大家抬头一看，大青山横卧面前，山腰间正画上一抹白烟，战士吴玉根喊起来：“打票呵，火车来了。”然后摸仿着火车的机器声：“气登康登！绥远大同！气登康登！不通不通！”引起大家哄然而笑。战士们今天显得特别兴奋，走起路来轻快多了。
    火车是从包头开向归绥的，九月二十七日，我军进到刘家营，离绥远省会归绥城仅三十里。一路上没有受到傅匪任何阻抗。
    归绥城北边二十里是大青山，往南看，在遥远的天边隐约一脉山影，东西两面则是一望无际的大草原。走过峰峦连绵的晋北，再看到这广阔的平川，顿觉胸襟开朗。
    在我军刚进入傅匪统治区时，沿途不断见到“空室清野，不跑者杀”的血腥口号。当时我军很耽心，恐怕归绥近郊的人民会因傅匪长期欺骗和威胁，不敢接近我军，但事实相反，这里人民不但没跑，并给与我军热情的支援。他们帮助我们把征借来的新粮磨去谷皮，给我们空出暖房大炕，房东吴老汉见我们睡了，轻轻把屋门掩上，这种种在细微事情上的体贴关怀，使我们深深体验到新区人民对解放军的热爱。
    头一天我们行军到离城七十里的中气村休息，见家家场里院里都堆着新收割下来的谷物。老百姓见我们停下，马上围拢过来找我们拉话。我们问路，他们清清楚楚地告诉离这村多远，离那村多远，并告诉我们再往前四十里就是昭君墓，倒好象我们不是来打仗，而是来游历似的。我开玩笑地问一个叫彭四潼的壮年：“你们怕不怕解放军？”他笑了笑说：“怕个啥？我们早就知道解放军不打人不骂人，对待老百姓好。前年你们来过这里，那时穿的是灰军装，一晚上就把这边据点里的伪蒙古军都下了枪。我院住着一个班，和和气气，扫院担水，吃粮烧柴都给钱。队伍走后，过来好多牲口驮了货到这里卖，洋火、白布、棉线，专收边区票，那货物合起来比我们用粮食买还贱呢！”这件事，刘家营的吴老汉也谈起过，他说：“解放军处处替老百姓着想，总怕老百姓吃亏。蒋介石就不管那一套，滥出票子……”说着他从腰里拿出一张一万元的法币给我看：“这还不是一张废纸！可以买些什么呢？要是真拿他来买东西，只能够买一条半棉线呵！”
    今年绥远丰收，老百姓的日子却还很苦。因为这里曾经被黑河的水刮了三年，过去三年什么粮食也没打下，但是贪婪无厌的傅匪，仍然逼着百姓交粮交款，百姓只好把牲口、家具卖了。这里的人民已经三年五年没有穿过新衣服了，我们送给他们一双破鞋子，就感激得不知说些什么好了。
    在肥沃的绥远土地上，丰收的年月里，傅匪统治着的地区却到处是饥饿的人们。他们知道，只有解放军到了以后才会有真正的丰收——属于他们自己的丰收；他们欢迎着解放军，希望解放军早日打下归绥城。
