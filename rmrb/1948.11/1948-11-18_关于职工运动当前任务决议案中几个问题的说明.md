　　Explanation of Several Issues in the Resolution on the Current Tasks of the Workers' Movement

　　(1) Working Hours
　　1. Working hours refer to the actual working time from when an employee enters the workplace to when they leave the workplace. An employee's learning (attending classes), commuting to and from work, and eating and resting outside the factory should not be counted as working hours. Which meetings can be held within working hours and paid as normal should be implemented in accordance with local government regulations.
　　2. The resolution stipulates that working hours may be extended in special circumstances, but should not exceed twelve hours at most, and no overtime work is allowed beyond twelve hours. Enterprises that extend working hours are limited to the following two categories:
　　a. Small enterprises that are temporarily unable to reduce working hours to ten hours;
　　b. Enterprises that operate continuously day and night and originally implemented a two-shift system, where the required labor intensity is not high, and there is no immediate need to change or temporary difficulty in changing to a three-shift system.
　　3. Shortened working hours due to special needs refer to industries that particularly affect health, such as work that produces toxic gases and excessively strenuous labor.
　　4. The resolution does not make specific provisions regarding the actual number of working days that should be in a year, because the circumstances vary from place to place and from enterprise to enterprise, and it is difficult to make unified regulations during wartime. The current situation in the liberated areas is that there are too many holidays throughout the year, and the actual number of working days is too few. Therefore, the following principles are temporarily stipulated:
　　a. The number of working days per year should not be too few, but employees must have a certain number of rest days. Therefore, in general enterprises, efforts should be made to ensure that the number of working days per year is more than 300 days. The 52 weeks of the year can be adjusted and stipulated by each enterprise. For those who implement the "big weekend" system, a certain number of personal leave days can be stipulated throughout the year without deduction of wages; for those who implement the "small weekend" system, the number of personal leave days without deduction of wages should not be stipulated too much, or it should be stipulated that personal leave must be deducted from wages. As for the vacation habits in large enterprises (such as railways) in the new areas, it is difficult to achieve more than 300 days for the time being, and the status quo can be maintained temporarily, pending further study and decision.
　　b. Annual festivals and commemorative holidays should also be reduced as much as possible. There should not be holidays for every commemoration, but the old habits of employees must be taken care of. The total number of holidays per year should be determined by the trade union federation of each region based on this principle, and submitted to the governments of the liberated areas for specific regulations, which will be unified after the national victory.

　　(2) Wages
　　1. The minimum wage for ordinary workers, including themselves, should be enough to support two people. The individual's living expenses are calculated according to the necessary living expenses (including clothing, food, housing, and necessary consumption) required to maintain a labor force in the current locality. The living expenses of dependents should generally be lower than the individual's living expenses, but should not be less than the minimum level of maintaining one person's life. In private enterprises with fewer than 20 people, the minimum wage for employees and apprentices should generally be calculated based on the actual income of the individual throughout the year (such as bonuses, holiday gifts, and other in-kind benefits).
　　2. The cross-progressive grading wage system means that the grades are arranged in a cross-cutting manner, and the difference between grades is progressive.
　　a. Why are the grades arranged in a cross-cutting manner? Because the nature of labor of various employees (such as technicians, skilled workers, technical staff, managers, etc.) in various enterprises (such as cotton textile industry, machinery industry, manufacturing industry, etc.) is different, so the standards for stipulating wage grades vary, either according to technical level, or according to responsibility, or according to proficiency, or according to intensity, etc. Since grades are stipulated separately according to various different standards, the wage grades of various enterprises and various employees will inevitably be arranged in an overlapping, crisscrossing form, and it is impossible to arrange them together into a single grade sequence. For example: the minimum wage of ordinary workers in a certain enterprise is 100, and the maximum wage is 180; the minimum wage of skilled workers is 120, and the maximum wage is 250; the minimum wage of technicians is 150, and the maximum wage is 350, so they become crisscrossed with each other. At the same time, each type of employee (such as ordinary workers, skilled workers, technicians, etc.) is divided into several grades according to skills, responsibilities, qualifications, etc., and the arrangement between grades is also cross-cutting, that is, the minimum wage of a first-grade, first-level worker can be lower than the maximum wage of a first-grade, second-level worker, and the maximum wage of a first-grade, third-level worker can be higher than the minimum wage of a first-grade, second-level worker. Therefore, if the wage grades of all kinds of enterprises and all kinds of employees are combined into a chart, it will inevitably form an extremely complex and crisscrossing form, and this grading method is called a cross-cutting grading system. Conversely, if the wage of a first-grade, third-level worker is 150 to 210, a first-grade, second-level worker is 210 to 280, a first-grade, first-level worker is 280 to 350, or the wages of ordinary workers are 100 to 150, the wages of skilled workers are 150 to 220, and the wages of technicians are 220 to 350, they all become a single trapezoidal grading system, rather than a cross-cutting grading system.
　　b. Why is the difference between grades progressive? Because no matter what kind of employee, after their skills and knowledge have reached a certain level, they must make greater efforts to improve further. Therefore, a more reasonable wage system should be that the lower the grade, the shorter the distance between grades (smaller difference); the higher the grade, the distance between grades should be lengthened accordingly (larger difference), so that employees can be encouraged to strive for progress. For example: the wage of a certain worker can be divided into 13 levels. Assuming that the 13th level is 100 points, each level above increases by 5 points, from the 8th level, it is changed to 8 points for each level; from the 4th level, it is changed to 12 points for each level, until the highest level is 200 points, which is a progressive grading system. Conversely, if the distance between each level is equal and progresses according to the level, it is an equal-difference grading system, not a progressive grading system.
　　This cross-progressive grading wage system is based on the principle of "more work, more pay" and is suitable for the actual labor conditions of various enterprises and various employees. Employees with special skills can be included in a reasonable grade for resolution. If there are individual employees with extremely special skills who cannot be promoted, with the approval of the superior government, they can enjoy special treatment outside the highest grade, but this situation is extremely rare and does not exist in every enterprise. The implementation of this wage system will enable employees with various technical and production management experience and abilities to receive reasonable treatment, avoid the phenomenon of egalitarianism in the past wages, and greatly encourage employees' learning. Except for small enterprises with very small production and operation scale, very simple production process, and few types of employees, which do not have the conditions for implementation, larger-scale enterprises and factories should implement this wage system, which is beneficial to the development of production.
　　3. The so-called "the number of grades is not limited to three grades, and the number of levels should be more" in the resolution refers to the past that some factories and enterprises simply adopted three grades and nine levels. For new enterprises with large scale and many types of employees, the division of grades should be more and more detailed. For example, workers of the Pinghan Railway in the past were divided into 28 levels in total; technicians were divided into three grades of A, B, and C, and each grade was divided into eight to thirteen levels; managers and medical staff among the staff were divided into four grades and thirty-eight levels; technical personnel were divided into five grades and twenty levels. The aforementioned cross-progressive grading method was used among various types, grades, and levels of employees, which is worthy of reference.
　　4. Staff members include technicians, managers, and medical staff, all of whom are mental laborers in the enterprise. The wage grades of ordinary staff members in the old society were generally reasonable; only some senior staff members enjoyed bureaucratic treatment, and some of them were bureaucrats themselves, which was unreasonable and needed to be reformed. We cannot promote "those who labor with their minds govern others" for staff wages as in the old society, and generally treat staff members better than workers, nor should we arbitrarily lower them to the wage standards of general workers. The skills of enterprise administrative management and certain specialized business skills (such as accounting, inspection, etc.) should also be regarded as technology and should not be listed as general treatment. The minimum salary of staff members should generally be slightly higher than the minimum wage of simple manual labor, because staff members must have considerable cultural ability before employment, which is clearly incomparable to a simple manual laborer. If workers are promoted to staff members due to work needs, in principle, the wage grade treatment that the position should have should be followed, but if it is lower than the original wage treatment, it should be paid according to the original wage treatment, and should not be reduced unless the individual is willing.
　　In state-owned enterprises in the newly liberated areas, the original wage grades of all employees should be recognized in principle and should not be disrupted temporarily. If the employee's wage is adjusted at any time according to the pre-war wage grade plus living allowance and according to the cost of living index, it should also remain unchanged in principle, and only the legal tender will be converted into local currency according to the exchange rate. Unreasonable points should only be adjusted and improved step by step after careful study, democratic evaluation by the masses, and careful decision by the factory management committee and enterprise management agency.
　　5. The form of wage based on in-kind calculation currently implemented in various parts of the liberated areas has its effect on guaranteeing the actual wages of workers. However, the disadvantage is that every time wages are paid, a large amount of currency will flood the market at the same time, stimulating prices to rise sharply. Therefore, even if wages are based on in-kind calculation, it is difficult to fully guarantee the actual income that employees should have, resulting in merchants profiting and both employees and the country suffering losses. Therefore, the resolution proposes a new rationing system. The general so-called rationing system is a method of guaranteeing supply by the state managing commodities and restricting consumption due to the lack of commodities, so as to prevent employees from buying commodities from merchants at high prices. The supply system that we have implemented in the liberated areas for many years also has the nature of this rationing system, but it is not equal to the rationing system. The resolution proposes to implement a new rationing system in state-owned factories, which is not the supply system that we have implemented. There is no experience in this new rationing system. Some opinions are that the state should run supply stores, or the state should supply cooperatives with various materials needed by employees, such as rice, flour, coal, cloth, and other industrial products, and employees can purchase various items they need at low prices stipulated by the state, so as to avoid the impact of market price fluctuations. For this reason, wages and prices can be frozen at the same time. Within a certain period, the price of supply stores and cooperatives will increase once, and wages will also increase at the same proportion. In this way, the exploitation of employees' consumption by merchants can be avoided, and it can be guaranteed that employees' wages can purchase scarce or expensive items on the market at low prices. At the same time, it is also convenient for the state to withdraw currency when paying wages, avoiding the stimulation of the market every time wages are paid. This method can be tried first and then promoted.

　　(3) Labor Protection
　　1. The labor protection referred to in the resolution includes three aspects: (1) labor insurance; (2) employee welfare; (3) factory safety and sanitation. The unemployment problem in the newly liberated cities and the difficulties in the lives of employed employees due to the war are handled by the government as general social problems within a certain period of time and are not included in the scope of labor protection in the resolution.
　　2. Regarding the labor protection issues of state-owned and public-owned enterprises, there are three opinions: First, labor insurance and employee welfare undertakings are combined into one, that is, all items such as employee injuries, deaths, disabilities, illnesses, old age, weakness, and the relief of poor families are handled by the factory allocating a certain percentage of the total amount of wages each month as a labor insurance fund, which is handed over to the employee welfare committee jointly organized by the factory and the trade union to solve (in this opinion, there is also a proposal that employees should pay 0.5% of their own wages). Second, labor insurance and employee welfare are separated. Regarding labor insurance issues, it is difficult to make a unified special facility in society during wartime, that is, all issues such as employee injuries, deaths, disabilities, illnesses, old age, etc. are resolved by the state through legislation and by each enterprise in factory regulations and collective contracts. In addition, the factory allocates 0.5% of the total amount of wages, and employees pay 0.5% of their own wages as an employee welfare fund to solve problems that cannot be solved in factory regulations and collective contracts in employees' lives (such as employee maternity subsidies, family illnesses, deaths, disaster relief, and partial subsidies for families with too many people). Third, labor insurance is divided into two parts: wages and medical expenses during employee injuries and illnesses are paid directly by the factory, while pensions, relief, and subsidies for employee injuries, deaths, old age, disabilities, illnesses, and childbirth are paid by the factory at 3% of the total amount of wages each month, and employees pay 5/1000 of their own wages as an insurance fund, which is handled by a committee jointly organized by the trade union and the factory in accordance with the labor regulations promulgated by the government, and the government supervises the implementation; in addition, the factory allocates 1.5% of the total amount of wages each month to the trade union to handle employee cultural and educational undertakings. The above three methods can be tried out in various places by choosing the one that suits the local conditions, and in cities with more concentrated industries, the first method can be gradually tried out, and the insurance fund can be handed over to the government labor bureau for overall management.
　　3. The resolution does not make specific provisions on the labor protection issues of private enterprises. The following methods are provided for reference. Enterprises employing more than 20 people can generally be handled in accordance with the principles of public enterprises, but in areas where the government has a special insurance agency, private entrepreneurs and their employees employing more than 20 people must also pay insurance premiums in accordance with regulations. The ratio to public enterprises can be the same, and there is no need to make any other distinction. Enterprises employing less than 20 people should generally follow their habits. Labor protection issues in private enterprises, regardless of the size of the enterprise, are stipulated by labor-capital agreements, and cannot be forced to be the same as the methods of public enterprises except for those stipulated by government laws and regulations.

　　(4) Apprentices
　　1. Those who learn technology and become technicians after a certain number of years are apprentices. Currently, some ordnance factories in North China regard many skilled workers who operate simple machines and engage in a specialized labor as apprentices (this type of "apprentice" accounts for 70% to 80% of the number of employees). Therefore, they often feel that the treatment of apprentices is too low, resulting in an egalitarian phenomenon that the treatment of apprentices is high, and the treatment of general ordinary workers and skilled workers (all of whom are called "apprentices") is too low, which should be corrected. Although skilled workers engaged in various simple labor also need a certain period of learning and training, this period is generally very short. These learning workers can be called training workers, not apprentices.
　　2. The treatment of apprentices should not be too high, because the main purpose of apprentices is to learn technology, not to obtain remuneration. In the early stage of apprenticeship, because they have just come out of the family and have personal bedding, they only take care of their own meals, in the middle stage, they can supplement the bedding, and in the later stage, it must be enough to maintain their own lives. And a corresponding allowance can be given according to the degree of learning. If the treatment of apprentices is too high, entrepreneurs will be unwilling to recruit apprentices, and we do not have the power to run a large number of vocational schools now, so it is difficult to cultivate technicians, which is detrimental to the development of industry.
　　3. According to Chinese social customs, the apprenticeship period should generally not exceed three years. The length of the period should be determined by the complexity and difficulty of the technology being learned. In public enterprises, apprentices who progress particularly quickly can shorten the learning period and be promoted to workers in advance after a certain form of examination.
　　4. Abuse and corporal punishment of apprentices must be abolished. In small-scale private enterprises, where the division of labor between work and life is not strict, the general customary services of apprentices to the master in life should not be emphasized against. In the newly liberated areas, the slogan of "apprentices turning over" should not be put forward, so as to avoid the opposition between masters and apprentices and affect the learning of technology.

### 关于职工运动当前任务决议案中几个问题的说明

　　关于职工运动当前任务决议案中几个问题的说明
  　（一）劳动时间
    一、劳动时间，为职工进入工作场所之后，到离开工作场所以前之实际工作时间。凡职工之学习（上课），上下班走路，在厂外吃饭休息的时间，均不应作劳动时间计算；何种会议得在工作时间以内召开，照发工资，应遵照当地政府之规定实行。
    二、决议规定有特殊需要可将劳动时间延长，但最多不得超过十二小时，并不得在十二小时以外加工，延长劳动时间的企业，以下列两项为限：
    子、小企业一时无法将劳动时间缩短为十小时者；
    丑、昼夜不停劳动的企业，原已实行两班制者，因所需要的劳动强度不高，而暂无必要改变或因一时困难无法改为三班制者。
    三、劳动时间因特殊需要而缩短者，系指有些工业特别影响健康，如产生有毒气体的工作及过于紧张的劳动等。
    四、关于全年应有的实际工作日，于决议未做具体规定，因为各地各企业的情况不同，在战争时期一时难做统一规定。现在解放区的情况是全年放假过多，实际工作日过少。因此暂作下列原则的规定：
    子、全年工作日数不应过少，但职工必须有一定的休息日期，故在一般企业，均应争取全年工作日须在三百天以上。全年五十二个星期，由各企业自行调剂规定。实行大礼拜制者，全年可以规定若干事假，不扣工资；实行小礼拜制者，不扣工资的事假则不应规定过多，或规定事假必须扣除工资。至于新区大企业（如铁路）中的休假习惯，一时难以做到三百天以上者，可暂维持原状，待研究后再决定。
    丑、关于年节及纪念假期，亦应尽量减少，不应每逢纪念即放假，而职工中的旧习惯又必须照顾。全年应有假期可由各地区职工总会根据这一原则，提出意见，请各解放区政府具体规定，俟全国胜利后，再作统一规定。
    （二）工资
    一、普通工人的最低工资，连本人在内应养活两个人，本人生活，按当时当地维持一个劳动力的必要生活费用（包括衣、食、住及必要消费）计算；被养人生活，一般应低于本人生活，但最低不得少于维持一个人生活的最低水平。在不满二十人的私人企业中，职工学徒的最低工资，一般应以本人全年的实际收入（如分红、年节馈赠及其他实物待遇等）计算。
    二、交叉累进的等级工资制，就是说等级排列是交叉的，等级间的差额是累进的。
    子、为什么等级排列是交叉的？因为各种企业（如棉织业、机器业、制造业………等）之中，各种职工（如技术工人、熟练工人、技术职员、管理人员等）的劳动性质不同，所以规定工资等级的标准因之而异，或按技术高低、或按责任轻重、或按熟练程度、或按强度大小………，既然按照各种不同标准分别规定等级，那么各种企业各种职工的工资等级，必然排列成为上下交叉的形式，而不可能混在一起排列成一个单一的等级序列。假如：某种企业的普通工人最低工资是一○○，最高工资是一八○；熟练工人最低工资是一二○，最高工资是二五○；技术工人最低工资是一五○，最高工资是三五○，这样就彼此成为交叉。同时每种职工（如普通工、熟练工、技术工等）又根据技能、职责、资历等等条件，在本身中分成几等几级，等与等、级与级之间，也是采取这种交叉式的排列，即是一等一级工人的最低工资可以低于一等二级的最高工资，一等三级的最高工资可以高于一等二级的最低工资。因此如将所有各种企业各种职工工资等级，合并列成图表，必然形成极错综的上下交叉的形式，这种等级排列的办法名为交叉的等级制。反之，如果一等三级工人的工资是一五○至二一○，一等二级是二一○至二八○，一等一级是二八○至三五○，或者是普通工人工资是一○○至一五○，熟练工人工资是一五○至二二○，技术工人工资是二二○至三五○，这就都成为单一梯形的等级制，而不是交叉的等级制了。
    丑、为什么等级的差额是累进的？因为不论何种职工，他们的技能学识已达到一定的程度以后，如再求提高，就必须付出更大的努力。因此，比较合理的工资制度，应是等级愈低，等级间的距离愈短（差额小）；等级愈高，则等级间的距离随之放长（差额大），这才能鼓励职工力求进步。譬如：某种工人的工资可分为十三级、假设其第十三级为一○○分，以上每进一级增加五分，自第八级以上，改为每级增加八分；自第四级以上，改为每级增加十二分，直到最高一级为二○○分，这就是累进的等级制。反之，如果每级距离相等，按级递进，即是等差的等级制，而不是累进的等级制了。
    这种交叉的累进的工资等级制，是根据多劳多得的原则，适合各种企业各种职工实际的劳动情况，一般的具有特殊技能的职工，均可列入合理的等级解决。如果再有个别具有极特殊技能的职工无法进级者，经过上级政府批准，可以在最高等级之外享受特殊优待，但是此种情形极少，并非每一企业都有。这种工资制度的实行，将使具有各种技术与生产管理经验能力之职工得到合理之待遇，可避免过去工资中的平均主义现象，并大大鼓励职工的学习。除了生产经营规模甚小，生产过程十分简军、职工种类不多的小企业，还不具有施行的条件以外，一般较大规模的企业工厂，都应实行这种工资制度，对于发展生产是有利的。
    三、决议中所谓“等数不限于三等，级数宜多，”系指过去有些工厂企业只简单采用三等九级而言。对新企业规模巨大、职工种类较多的企业，等级之分，宜多宜细。如过去平汉铁路工人，一共分为二十八级；技术工人中分甲、乙、丙三等，每等中又分八至十三级；职员中的管理人员与医务人员计分四等三十八级；在技术人员中则分为五等二十级；在各类、各等、各级的职工之间，又采用前述交叉累进的等级办法，值得参考。
    四、职员包括技术人员、管理人员、医务人员，均为企业中的脑力劳动者。旧社会普通职员的工资等级，一般是合理的；只有一部分高级职员享受官僚待遇，其中有的本人就是官僚，则是不合理的，需要加以改革。我们对职员工资，既不能如旧社会所提倡“劳心者治人”，对职员待遇一般皆较工人优厚，亦不应随便低压至一般工人工资标准之下。企业行政管理的技能，与某些专门业务的技能（如会计、检验等等），也应视为技术，不可列为一般待遇。职员的最低薪资，一般应稍高于一个简单体力劳动的最低工资，因为职员在就业以前必须具有相当的文化能力，与一个简单体力劳动者显然不可相比。因为工作需要提升工人为职员者，原则上应按所负职务应有的工资等级待遇，但若低于其原来的工资待遇时，应按原来工资待遇发给，若非本人自愿，不得降低。
    在新解放区国营企业中，对一切职工原有的工资等级，原则上应该承认，暂时不可打乱。如职工工资系按战前工资等级加生活补贴并依生活指数随时调整者，原则上亦应照旧不变，只将法币依比价折成本币支付。其中不合理处，只有在研究清楚后，经过群众民主评议，由工厂管理委员会及企业管理机关慎重决定，再逐步调整改进。
    五、现在解放区各地所实行的以实物为计算基础的工资形式，对于保障工人的实际工资有其效果。但缺点是每发一次工资，必有大量通货在同一时间侵入市场，刺激物价猛涨。故工资虽已实物为计算基础，亦难充分保证职工应有之实际收入，造成商人渔利，职工及国家均受损失。因此，决议提出新的配给制度。一般的所谓配给制度，就是由于商品缺乏，国家管理商品、限制消费，保证供给的一种办法，以免职工从商人手中高价地去购买商品。我们解放区已行之多年的供给制，也带有这种配给制的性质，但不等于配给制。决议提出在国营工厂中实行新的配给制度，不是我们所实行的供给制，这种新的配给制度，现在尚无经验，有的意见由国家办供给商店，或由国家供给合作社以职工所需要的各种物资，如米、面、煤、布及其他工业品等，职工可以按国家规定的低廉的价格去购买其所需要的各种物品，以免受市场物价波动的影响，为此，即可将工资与物价同时冻结。在一定时期，供给商店及合作社的物价上涨一次，工资也以同样比例上涨一次。由此，可以避免商人对职工消费的剥削，保证职工的工资可以廉价地购买到社会上所缺少的或高价的物品。同时又便于国家在发工资时将通货回笼，避免每次发工资时对市场的刺激。此种办法，可先试验后再推行。
    （三）劳动保护
    一、决议所指劳动保护，包含三方面的问题：（一）劳动保险；（二）职工福利；（三）工厂安全卫生。关于新解放区城市之失业问题及在业职工因战争所受生活上之困难时，在一定时期内，由政府按一般社会问题处理，不在决议所谓劳动保护范围之列。
    二、关于国营、公营企业的劳动保护问题，有三种意见：其一，将劳动保险与职工福利事业合而为一处理，即凡属职工之伤亡、残废、疾病、老弱及贫寒家属的救济等项，均由工厂每月按工资的总额拨出若干份做为劳动保险基金，交由工厂与工会等各方面共同组织的职工福利委员会统筹解决（在这种意见中，另有主张职工应出本人工资的百分之○·五者）。其二，将劳动保险与职工福利分开，关于劳动保险问题，战时很难做为社会上的统一专门设施，即凡职工伤亡、残废、疾病、老弱等问题，由国家立法，由各企业单位在厂规及集体合同中解决。另由工厂拨出工资总额的百分之○·五，职工缴纳本人工资的百分之○·五，做为职工福利基金，解决职工生活中凡厂规与集体合同中所不能解决的问题（诸如职工生育补助、家属疾病、死亡、灾害的救济，及家庭人口过多者的部分津贴等项）。其三，是将劳动保险分为两部分：职工伤亡、疾病时的工资和医药费由工厂直接支付，而职工伤亡、老残、疾病、生育的抚恤、救济、补助金等，则由工厂每月按工资总数支出百分之三，职工缴纳本人工资千分之五，作为保险基金，由工会与工厂共同组织委员会，按照政府颁布之劳动条例办理，并由政府监督实行；此外，再由工厂每月按工资总数拨出百分之一点五，交工会办理职工文化教育事业。上述三种办法，各地可择其适合当地条件者试办之，而在工业比较集中的城市，则可按第一种办法逐步试行，并可将保险基金交政府劳动局统筹办理。
    三、对私营企业的劳动保护问题，决议未做具体规定。兹提下列办法，以供参考。雇用二十人以上之企业，一般可参照公营企业原则办理，但在政府有专门保险机关的地区，雇用二十人以上之私人企业主及其职工，亦须按规定缴纳保险金。其与公营企业之比例，可以一样，不必另有区别。雇用二十人以下之企业，原则上从其习惯。私营企业中的劳动保护问题，不论企业规模大小，其中具体问题均由劳资协议规定，除政府法令规定者外，不可强与公营企业的办法一样。
    （四）学徒
    一、经过一定年限，学习技术，而成为技术工人者为学徒。现在华北有些军火工厂将许多操作简单机械、从事一种专门劳动的熟练工人，也当作学徒（此种“学徒”占到职工人数的百分之七十至百分之八十以上）。因此经常感到学徒待遇过低，结果造成学徒待遇高，而一般普通工人、熟练工人（均被称为“学徒”者）的待遇过低之平均主义现象，应该纠正。各种单纯劳动的熟练工人，虽然也需经一定时期的学习和训练，但这种时期一般很短，此种学习的工人可以称为养成工，而不要称为学徒。
    二、学徒待遇不宜过高，因为学徒的主要目的在学习技术，而不在取得报酬。学徒初期因刚从家庭出来，且带有随身被服，故只管本人吃饭，中期可以补充被服，后期则必须足够维持本人生活。并可按学习程度给予相当津贴。学徒待遇过高，企业主将不愿招收学徒，而我们现在又无力量开办大批职业学校，结果技术工人难以培养，对发展工业是不利的。
    三、学徒年限根据中国社会习惯，一般不得超过三年。年限长短，应以所学技术的繁简难易而定。在公营企业中，进步特快的学徒，经过一定形式的考验，学习年限可以缩短，提前升为工人。
    四、对学徒的虐待、体罚，必须取消。在小规模的私营企业中，工作与生活的分工不严密，学徒对师傅在生活上一般惯有的勤务，不应强调反对。在新解放区，更不应提“学徒翻身”的口号，以免师徒对立，影响技术的学习。
