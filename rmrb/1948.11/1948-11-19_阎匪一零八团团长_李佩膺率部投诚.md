　　Yan Bandit 108th Regiment Commander
  　Li Peiying Leads His Troops in Surrender
    [Jinzhong Telegram] Delayed News: On the evening of October 19th, the entire Yan bandit "Shame Eradication and Striving Regiment" 108th Regiment, totaling over 1,000 people, who were besieged in Hanshan, 50 li east of Taiyuan City, collectively surrendered to us under the leadership of Regiment Commander Li Peiying. The Yan bandit's "Shame Eradication and Striving Regiment" was composed of officers and soldiers who had been captured by us and then released. Its commander-in-chief was Shi Zebo, the lieutenant general and commander of the Yan bandit's 19th Army, who was captured during the Shangdang Campaign. The vast majority of these captured officers and soldiers who were released by our army originally wanted to return home to live in peace and engage in production, deeply influenced by our army's leniency, edification, and education. However, the Yan bandits still did not let them go. Most of them were seized and taken to the "Return to Dry Cadre Regiment" for training, forced to "confess and be reborn." Any slight dissatisfaction was falsely accused of being a disguised element, and they were beaten to death with sticks. The number of officers and soldiers killed has reached more than 700. After training, the reactionary words "Resolutely Oppose Communism," etc., were tattooed on each person's wrist or forehead, and they were bailed out and incorporated into the "Shame Eradication and Striving Regiment" to make them fight against us as frontline troops. Since we launched an attack on the eastern mountains, occupied most of Shizuizi Niu Tuo Village and Dabeijian, and cut off their retreat, they were filled with disappointment, shame, and fear, waiting for the opportunity to lay down their weapons. Our army consistently adhered to a lenient policy, exposing the Yan bandit's conspiracy, and expressing understanding of their forced combat. The entire unit finally surrendered and arrived safely in a certain liberated area.

　　阎匪一零八团团长
  　李佩膺率部投诚
    【晋中电】迟到消息：十月十九日晚被围于太原城东五十里旱山之阎匪“雪耻奋斗团”一零八团全部共千余人，在团长李佩膺率领下，集体向我投诚。阎匪之“雪耻奋斗团”系被我俘虏后放回去之官兵组成，其总指挥为上党战役被俘之阎匪第十九军中将军长史泽波。这批被我军放回去之俘虏官兵，绝大多数因深受我军之宽大、感化、教育，本来是想回去安居生产，可是阎匪仍不放过他们，大部抓到“返干团”受训，迫令“自白转生”，稍有不满即诬指为伪装分子，乱棍处死，被杀害官兵已达七百余人。受训后每人手腕或前额均被刺上“坚决反共”等反动字样，取保编入“雪耻奋斗团”，使他们作第一线部队与我作战。自我向东山发起攻击，占领石嘴子牛驼寨大部及大北尖等地，切断其退路以后，他们心中充满失望、惭愧与恐惧，等待时机放下武器，我军一秉宽大政策，揭露阎匪阴谋，对他们被迫作战表示谅解，该部终于全部投诚，安全到达解放区某地。
