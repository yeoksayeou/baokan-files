　　【Our Dispatch】On the second day of the North China Trade Union Joint Conference, Comrade Li Zaiwen reported on the current tasks of the North China labor movement. Comrade Zaiwen first explained the victorious situation in the country and North China. Then, he mentioned that the North China labor movement was the earliest in China. In the second year of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, the first trade union organization was established in Changxindian, followed by the large-scale strikes of the Kailuan Five Mines and the Beijing-Hankou Railway, which were glorious pages in the history of the Chinese labor movement. The worker comrades in North China have consistently adhered to the spirit of the Great Revolution, and have bravely fought through hardships, especially in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Anti-Chiang War. For decades, they have sought liberation for the Chinese nation and the Chinese people, and for the working class itself, and have already achieved liberation in an area with a population of 168 million. Our victory in North China today is the great result of the struggle and victory of the workers and people of North China under the leadership of the Communist Party. Then, according to the general task and general policy of the Sixth National Labor Congress of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital," and the policy program adopted by the North China Provisional People's Representative Conference, Comrade Zaiwen proposed that the current tasks of the North China workers should be: "Uniting all employees, enhancing labor enthusiasm, improving technology, increasing production quality and quantity, actively supporting the front, and at the same time strengthening worker education, improving technology, raising worker awareness and production management capabilities, and conscientiously protecting worker welfare."

　　In order to achieve the above tasks, Comrade Zaiwen put forward the following important issues:

　　First, mobilize all employees to launch production competitions and labor hero movements according to the administrative production plan. He pointed out that this movement had been very successful in promoting production development in the past, and should continue to be promoted in the future. During the preparatory period for the conference, various localities can start this work with emphasis, gain new experience, but must pay attention to opposing formalism. He also pointed out that completing a production task in a factory or enterprise is by no means something that one person or a few activists can achieve. It must rely on the unity and mutual assistance and active efforts of all employees. Therefore, in addition to playing a leading role, labor heroes must closely connect with the masses in production and prevent the pursuit of championships. When awarding prizes, attention should be paid to the majority in order to launch mass production competitions and labor hero movements.

　　Second, regarding the issue of production management, Comrade Zaiwen pointed out that in this issue, the main issues are enterprise and democratization. He pointed out that during the preparation period, if conditions permit, a production management inspection movement with emphasis and organization can be launched in accordance with the instructions of the Labor Congress and the resolutions of the Industry and Commerce Conference. On the one hand, the administration should check bureaucracy; on the other hand, workers should be mobilized to conduct self-criticism in order to strengthen the unity between the administration and the workers, establish the workers' sense of ownership, and thereby establish factory management committees and worker representative conferences and other organizations.

　　Third, regarding the issue of worker education, Comrade Zaiwen pointed out that our class ranks have expanded unprecedentedly and are expanding. However, in the situation where the national liberation is not far away, we must train a large number of cadres who are proficient in Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, strengthening cadre learning and improving theoretical level have become our important tasks. In the future, learning should be regarded as one of the main conditions for identifying cadres. Secondly, according to the decision of the North China Government, the North China Workers' School was established, mainly to study Mao Zedong Thought, so as to more effectively improve the theoretical level of workers. Regarding the improvement of workers' cultural level and technical level, the trade unions of each factory should cooperate with the administration to regularly and systematically organize literacy classes, spare-time schools, etc. for workers, and attention must be paid to regularity, and avoid sporadic efforts.

　　Fourth, regarding labor protection and worker welfare issues, Comrade Zaiwen explained in several issues: (1) Wage issue: Strictly implement the resolutions of the Labor Congress, implement the cross-progressive wage system in state-owned enterprises, oppose egalitarianism, and ensure the implementation of the four conditions of wage standards: "technology, position, labor attitude, and work ability." (2) Labor protection issues: Conduct investigations first, and then conduct specific research after the representatives who participated in the Labor Congress return. The labor insurance fund has already been decided by the Industry and Commerce Conference, and the figure is very large, so it must be used well. (3) Worker welfare work: First, run cooperatives well to meet the daily needs of workers, and run a comprehensive worker publication to exchange experiences and practice writing newsletters.

　　Fifth, regarding the time for the convening of the representative conference, Comrade Zaiwen agreed with the opinions of the representatives from various places and decided to convene it in March next year. During the preparation period, it is hoped that various places will send materials on the experience and lessons of the past labor movement. Finally, specific regulations were also made on the meeting system and reporting system, and the importance of democratic centralism in worker organizations to workers' democratic rights was clarified.

　　团结全体员工增产支前
  　加强职工教育提高觉悟
    栗再温同志报告工运当前任务
    【本报特讯】华北职工联席会议之次日，由栗再温同志报告华北职工运动当前的任务。再温同志首先说明全国及华北的胜利形势，继即述及我华北职工运动，在中国来说是最早的，在中国共产党成立的第二年，首先在长辛店有了职工的组织，继之有开滦五矿大罢工，京汉铁路大罢工，在中国职工运动史上是光辉的一页。华北的职工同志们一贯的坚持了大革命斗争的精神，特别在抗日与反蒋战争中，披历艰险，英勇奋斗，几十年来为中国民族与中国人民，为工人阶级自己求解放，而且已在一万万六千八百万人口地区获得解放。我们今天华北的胜利，是华北职工与华北人民在共产党领导下，斗争胜利的伟大成果。接着再温同志根据六次劳大指示“发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利”的总任务总方针，及华北临时人民代表大会通过的施政方针，提出华北职工的当前任务，应该是：“团结全体员工、提高劳动热忱、改进技术、增加生产质量与数量、积极支援前线，并同时加强职工教育，提高技术、提高职工觉悟与管理生产的能力，认真保护职工福利”。
    为达到完成以上任务的目的，再温同志提出以下几个重要问题：
    第一、动员全体职工根据行政上的生产计划，展开生产竞赛及劳动英雄运动。指出这一运动过去在推动发展生产上，是很有成绩的，今后要继续提倡。在筹备大会期间，各地可有重点的开始这一工作，取得新的经验，但必须注意反对形式主义。并指出在工厂企业中完成一个生产任务，决不是一个人或少数积极分子所能成功，必须依靠全体职工的团结互助与积极努力，因之劳动英雄除起带头作用以外，必须在生产中密切联系群众，防止闹锦标主义。在奖励时要注意多数，以便展开群众性的生产竞赛与劳动英雄运动。
    第二、关于生产管理问题，再温同志指出：在这一问题上主要是企业化与民主化两个问题。并指出：在筹备期间，如有条件，可按劳大指示与工商会议决议，展开一个有重点有组织的生产管理检查运动。一方面行政上检查官僚主义；另方面发动工人进行自我批评，以便加强行政与职工之间的团结，树立职工主人翁的思想，从而建立工厂管理委员会与职工代表会等组织。
    第三、职工教育问题，再温同志指出：我们阶级的队伍已空前的扩大了并正在扩大着，但在全国解放为期不远的形势下，我们更须培养大批精通马列主义的干部，因之加强干部学习，提高理论水平成为我们重要任务，今后要把学习当成鉴定干部的主要条件之一。其次依据华北政府决定，成立华北职工学校，主要学习毛泽东思想，以更有效的提高职工的理论水平。关于职工的文化水平与技术水平的提高，各厂工会要协同行政，经常的，有计划的，组织职工识字班、业余学校等，必须注意经常，不要一曝十寒。
    第四、关于劳动保护与职工福利问题，再温同志分几个问题说明：（一）工资问题：厉行劳大决议，在公营企业中实行交叉累进工资制，反对平均主义，确保工资标准的“技术、职位、劳动态度，工作能力”四个条件的执行。（二）劳动保护问题：先进行调查，等参加劳大的代表回来后，再作具体研究。劳动保险金，工商会议已有决定，数字是很大的，要很好运用。（三）职工福利工作：先办好合作社，满足职工日常生活的需要，并办一综合性的工人刊物，借以交流经验，练习写通讯。
    第五、关于代表会的召开时间，再温同志同意各地代表意见，决定于明年三月召开，在筹备期间，希望各地汇寄过去职工运动的经验教训的材料。最后关于会议制度汇报制度亦作具体规定，并阐明民主集中制的工人组织对职工民主权利的重视。
