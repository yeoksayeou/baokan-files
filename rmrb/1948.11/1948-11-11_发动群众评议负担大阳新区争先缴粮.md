Mobilize the Masses to Evaluate Burdens; New Great Yang District Competes to Pay Grain

[This newspaper reports] (our newspaper) The masses in the newly established Great Yang County (newly established county, part of Datong and Yanggao) in the Northern Yue region were liberated amidst the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army, freed from the Kuomintang bandits' heavy taxes and extortion, and were extremely joyous. In the autumn grain collection work, due to the thorough mobilization of the masses and democratic evaluation, certain selfish and departmentalist ideas were overcome, and many hidden lands were uncovered. Everyone felt that the democratic government's methods were reasonable and fair, and the mills in each village were running day and night, competing to pay public grain. This influenced the masses in the enemy-occupied areas to secretly contact the democratic government and pay grain at night, demanding: "Eliminate the Yan and Fu bandits as soon as possible." Great Yang's seventh district, located east of Datong City and north of the Ping-Sui Railway, relies on Cailue Mountain. It suffered severe disaster this spring due to the Kuomintang bandits' heavy taxes and extortion. It once forced Sishilipu village, with less than 40 hectares of land, to pay 423.28 dan of rice, averaging over 1 dan per mu. Ren Yong from the village said: "I harvest a lot of grain in the village, but even if I paid all my straw, it wouldn't be enough." Under the enemy's ruthless oppression, the masses placed all their hopes on the People's Liberation Army.

After liberation, the democratic government allocated public grain to each village according to the principles of reasonable burden, based on the population, land, output, and harvest of each village. In the mountain areas where land reform had been implemented, the burden was distributed to 80% of the population. In the border areas and newly liberated areas, the burden was also distributed to 50% to 60% of the population. The entire district spent ten days distributing the burdens to individual households. District cadres went to the villages in groups, held mass meetings, announced the spirit of tax collection, elected five to seven evaluators, and then divided all the heads of households into groups of five to seven, electing a group leader. Everyone discussed and studied the points each household should bear. The evaluators evaluated the points based on the opinions of each group, and announced the preliminary evaluation results to the masses. District and village cadres and evaluators went deep into the masses to listen to opinions. At this time, the households generally did not say who was paying less or more, but only wanted to pay less themselves. In Julibao Village, after discussion and review, the distribution was actually reasonable, but several "cunning ghosts" (as the masses said) insisted that they were paying too much, causing those with equal scores to want to exchange property with them, forcing them to shut their mouths. Wu Jiawa carefully considered land, population, grain production, and labor, and allocated the burdens to all households. The masses generally reflected: "This year's public grain is not much, and it's reasonable." The masses in Xiguan Village said at the conference: "It's three or four times lighter than under the enemy."

After the points for public grain to be paid were distributed to each household, the mills in each village ran day and night, competing to mill rice and pay first. The masses in the border areas, under the close surveillance of enemy agents, did not dare to send grain during the day. At night, they carried it on their backs, loaded it on animals, and pulled it in carts. Even villages where the enemy was frequently stationed paid public grain under the cover of our troops. The masses said: "If we pay our own grain, the troops will have something to eat when they come, and the enemy won't be able to grab it. The People's Liberation Army can eliminate them easily." The villages near the city could not send grain, so they sent people to talk to the district cadres about paying in cash, and set a five-day deadline for completion. Before leaving, they repeatedly instructed the district cadres: "Please tell the higher authorities to send troops to eliminate the scourge for the people and eliminate the Yan and Fu bandits as soon as possible."

　　发动群众评议负担大阳新区争先缴粮
    【本报讯】北岳大阳县（新设县，大同、阳高各一部）新区群众，在人民解放军胜利进军中获得了解放，解脱了蒋傅匪的苛税勒索，欢欣异常。秋征工作中，由于深入发动了群众，民主评议，克服了某些自私的本位主义思想，查出不少黑地，人人感到民主政府的办法合理公平，各村的碾子昼夜不停，争先缴纳公粮。影响敌占区群众也都在黑夜偷着与民主政府接洽、缴粮，要求：“早一天消灭阎、傅匪。”大阳七区位处大同城东，平绥路北侧，靠采掠山。历经蒋傅匪苛税勒索，造成今春严重的灾荒。曾逼使全村不足四十顷地的四十里铺，缴四百二十三石二斗八升米，每亩平均要缴一斗以上，村里任永说：“村中我打粮食不算少，连我的草全缴了也不够。”在敌人穷凶极恶的压榨下，群众把希望都寄托在解放军身上。
    解放后，民主政府根据各村的人口、土地、产量、年景，按合理负担的税收原则将公粮分配到村。实行过土改的山地，负担面达到百分之八十，边沿区与新区负担面也达百分之五十到六十。全区经十天时间布置到户。区干部分组在村进行时，召开群众会，宣布税收精神，选举五人至七人为评议员，再将所有户主划成五人至七人的小组，推选组长，大家酝酿研究各户应负担分数，评议员根据各小组的意见评议分数，把初步评议结果向群众宣布，区村干部评议员深入群众听取意见，这时各户一般不说谁轻谁重，只想自己少拿点。在聚乐堡村经讨论审查，实际已合理，有几个“奸滑鬼”（群众语）硬说自己重，引起分数和他相等的人要和他换产业，逼的他闭口无言。吴家洼比土地、比人口、比产粮、比劳动、慎重的考虑后，也全部分配到户，群众普遍反映：“今年的公粮不多，也合理”西关村群众在大会上说：“比敌人轻三、四倍。”
    应缴公粮分数分配到各户后各村的碾子便昼夜不停争着碾米，争先缴纳。边沿区群众在敌人特务的严密监视下，白天不敢送，夜间背的、驮的、车拉的，还有敌人经常驻扎的村也在我部队掩护下缴公粮，群众说：“把咱们自己粮缴完，部队来了有吃的，敌人来了抢不上，解放军好消灭他们。”城附近的村不能送粮，派人找区干部谈缴款，并自订五天完成，临走再三嘱咐区干部说：“你转告上级，调兵马来，为民除害，早一天消灭阎傅匪。”
