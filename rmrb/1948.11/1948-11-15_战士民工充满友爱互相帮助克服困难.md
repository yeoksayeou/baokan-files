　　[Jinzhong Dispatch] At the Taiyuan front, the People's Liberation Army and civilian laborers from both new and old areas participating in the war effort have been helping each other and overcoming difficulties, displaying a high degree of revolutionary class friendship. When it rained while the civilian laborers were working on fortifications, the soldiers immediately came out from under the tarpaulin-covered artillery vehicles, which offered shelter from the rain, and let the civilian laborers go inside to take refuge. The "West Sea" and "South Sea" units also helped solve the difficulties of the accompanying civilian laborers in various ways, lending their coats, blankets, and shoes to those who were thinly clothed and lacked bedding. Barbers gave haircuts to the civilian laborers, and medical personnel treated them; when the civilian laborers were too busy to transport grain, a certain unit allocated a donkey to them. In order to specifically help the civilian laborers, the 1315th unit even extracted company and platoon deputy-level cadres to go deep into the civilian labor company and platoon work, conducting practical education on air defense, poison gas defense, and artillery defense, targeting the civilian laborers' thinking. At ordinary times, sentries were set up on the front line to prevent accidental dangers to the civilian laborers. When receiving tasks and going to the front line, they would first take the civilian laborers to see the terrain and routes, explain the situation, and walk in front when passing through dangerous areas. When encountering exposed ground, they would direct the civilian laborers to disperse and pass through. The cadres even stood individually beside the landmines buried by the enemy, directing the civilian laborers to advance safely. Comrade Liu, the civilian affairs officer of the unit's civilian work section, shared the joys and hardships with the civilian laborers, taking meticulous care of them, personally carrying ammunition for the elderly and weak civilian laborers, and finding houses for them. Sometimes when there was nothing to eat, he would borrow rice and vegetables from the troops. This moved the civilian laborers, and their morale was extremely high. During the action, civilian laborers from Xiaoyi automatically carried artillery mounts for the soldiers. When the troops returned to this area to rest after fighting at the front, the civilian laborers from Jizhong immediately gave up their houses to the troops because they had no houses. The civilian laborers from Jizhong also preferred to camp out or sleep on the ground, giving the houses and kangs to the civilian laborers from Jiexiu. Wang Guangfu automatically helped the civilian laborers from Qixian put boxes of ammunition into the cave dwellings under the enemy planes circling overhead. The internal solidarity and overcoming of difficulties among the civilian laborers was the same as that between the civilian laborers of various units. The company commander, deputy company commander, instructor, and doctor of the 11th company of civilian laborers from Yuxian lent their own money, cotton trousers, lined jackets, and horse blankets to the civilian laborers who had not brought cotton clothes. Dong Chengyuan, the squad leader of the civilian laborers from Pingding, covered the sick with his own coat, carried weapons and backpacks for the sick, and used his own money to buy noodles for the sick to eat. In the civilian laborers, everyone competed to do the chores in life, such as carrying water, sweeping the yard, cooking, and borrowing things, and everyone actively overcame difficulties. Liu Shihhu, a member of the 7th transport company of Dingxiang, organized everyone to cut wild grass when the livestock had no grass to eat, and organized everyone to cut artemisia to burn the kang for warmth. In addition to completing general tasks, Liu Erniu, the squad leader of the civilian laborers from Yuxian, squeezed out time to cut thorns, weave baskets, and sell them to solve everyone's living difficulties. Under the condition that firewood could not be supplied, the civilian laborers of each unit chopped their own firewood. In Yangliu, six cooks carried more than 2,600 jin of firewood in two days. The second squadron of Jiexiu picked up firewood, and did not spend money on it for five days, which not only ensured meals, but also improved life.
