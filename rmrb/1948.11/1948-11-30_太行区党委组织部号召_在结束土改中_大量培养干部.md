　　Taihang District Party Committee Organization Department Calls for
  　Large-Scale Training of Cadres in the Concluding Stage of Land Reform
    [Taihang Electric] The Organization Department of the Taihang District Party Committee recently published a special article entitled "Attention Must Be Paid to Large-Scale Training of Cadres in the Concluding Stage of Land Reform," pointing out that the Linxian, Tangyin, and Jixian counties of the Fifth Prefectural Committee all attached great importance to the large-scale training and promotion of district cadres in the winter's concluding land reform movement. Linxian had already promoted 77 district cadres during the concluding land reform movement before autumn. Yexian, after two training courses, promoted 100 district cadres, completely filling the vacancies. Their method of training was to select village cadres who had close ties with the masses, were relatively conscious, had considerable work experience and potential for cultivation from villages that had concluded land reform before autumn, and give them short-term training (lasting about half a month). Linxian trained 300 village cadres. Tangyin trained 120 village cadres. In Linxian, half of them returned to work in their original villages, and the other half, who were better, temporarily left production and organized work teams to lead production in 116 villages that had concluded land reform before autumn. Tangyin also deployed all the trained village cadres to the first batch of villages concluding land reform. After training and discovering key personnel, they were directed to the second and third batches of villages concluding land reform. In this way, through the cultivation and testing of the winter's concluding land reform movement, they prepared to promote district cadres on a large scale. Secondly, in Linxian, responsible comrades from the county and district committees personally gave Party lessons every time village cadres gathered, grasping the regular study and Party education of cadres, which also had a great effect.
    Currently, there are many cadre vacancies in various places, especially women cadres. In the current situation where we are about to move towards national victory, large-scale training and promotion of cadres based on the existing foundation has become a very important task and a problem that needs to be solved urgently. We believe that the Fifth Prefectural Committee's attention to this issue and the active methods of training cadres are very good and should be given attention in various places. We should seize the favorable opportunity of this winter's concluding land reform movement to train and promote cadres on a large scale and create more experience. However, there are also some places that do not see the foundation of more than ten years of work and do not actively train cadres, only shouting about the difficulty of cadres. This negative sentiment must be strictly corrected.

　　太行区党委组织部号召
  　在结束土改中  大量培养干部
    【太行电】太行区党委组织部顷以“结束土改中必须注意大量培养干部”为题，发表专论指出：五地委林县、汤阴、汲县在冬季结束土改运动中，领导上都十分重视了大批培养提拔区干部问题。林县在秋前的结束土改运动中，已提拔出七十七个区干部。邺县经过两期训练班提拔了一百个区干部，完全补齐了缺额。他们培养的办法，是从秋前结束土改的村庄，抽调与群众有密切联系、觉悟较好、有相当工作经验和培养前途的村干部，加以短期训练（时间半月左右）。林县训练了三百个村干部。汤阴训练了一百二十个村干部。林县有一半回原村工作，一半较好的暂时脱离生产，组织工作队，到秋前结束了土改的一百一十六个村领导生产。汤阴亦将训练过的村干全投入第一批结束土改的村庄，经过锻炼与发现了骨干后，即转向第二批、第三批结束土改村。这样经过冬季结束土改运动的培养与考验，准备大量提拔区干部。其次，林县实行了每次村干部集会时，由县委、区委负责同志亲自上党课，抓紧经常的干部学习与党的教育，效果亦很大。
    目前各地干部缺额很多，尤其妇女干部为甚。在今天即将走向全国胜利的形势下，从现有基础上大量的培养与提拔干部，成了部分重要的任务与急待解决的问题。五地委各县对此问题的重视，和积极培养干部的办法，我们认为很好，应引起各地重视，并抓住今冬结束土改运动的有利时机，大量培养提拔干部，创造更多的经验。但也有某些地方看不见十来年的工作基础，不积极培养干部，只空喊干部困难，这种消极情绪必须严格纠正。
