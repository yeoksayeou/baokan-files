　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 6th. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, which once suffered severe disasters, is generally reporting a bumper harvest this autumn. The average harvest of autumn crops in the entire region can reach 80%. In the mountainous areas of Huanglong County in the Huanglong sub-region, where land is vast and sparsely populated, corn is widely planted. Due to fallowing last year, this year's output is particularly high; good land can produce about six斗 per mu, and mountainous land averages three斗 per mu (30斤 per斗). In Hancheng, the 40,000 mu of cotton fields in the river valley area have an average yield of 120斤 of seed cotton per mu (which can be ginned into more than 40斤 of refined cotton); the 90,000 mu of corn in the mountainous area averages two斗 per mu. In the Guanzhong sub-region, the average yield in the third district of Xinzheng County can reach four斗 per mu. In the Longdong sub-region, buckwheat in Huaichi County can yield two to three斗 per mu, and sorghum can yield four斗. In the Yan'an sub-region, most areas of ＠ County, Linzhen, and Ganquan counties, and a small part of Yanchang County, have achieved a 100% harvest. On average, each顷 of river valley land can yield one stone of coarse grain, and mountainous land can yield six斗; other areas can also achieve 80% yield. However, because this sub-region suffered extensive damage from the Chiang Kai-shek/Hu Zongnan bandit troops, the spring and summer disasters were quite severe, and the cultivated area decreased by one-sixth compared to before the bandit troops invaded the border region. Therefore, the CCP Land Committee of this sub-region has called for the organization of the masses to carry out winter production and increase farmers' income to avoid a spring famine next year. As for some areas of Hengshan, Mizhi, Jiaxian, and Zhenchuan counties under the Suide sub-region, they suffered hail damage and had poor harvests, and still need relief.

　　陕甘宁战胜灾荒秋季获八成丰收
    【新华社西北六日电】曾经遭受严重灾荒的陕甘宁边区今秋普告丰收。全区秋季农作物收获量平均可达八成。黄龙分区黄龙县山区地广人稀，广种包谷，由于去年休耕，今年产量特多；好川地每亩可产六斗左右，山地每亩均产三斗（每斗三十斤）。韩城四万亩川地的棉田，每亩平均产籽花一百二十斤（可轧熟花四十余斤）；九万亩山地的包谷，每亩平均可产二斗。关中分区新正县三区平均每亩均可收四斗。陇东分区华池县荞麦每亩可收二三斗，高粱可收四斗。延属分区＠县、临镇、甘泉等县大部地区及延长县少部地区均十成年景，平均每垧川地可收粗粮一石，山地可收六斗；其余地区亦可收到八成。但该分区因遭蒋胡匪军大肆破坏，春夏灾荒相当严重，耕地面积较匪军进攻边区前减少六分之一，故该分区中共地委已号召组织群众进行冬季生产，增加农民收入，以避免明年发生春荒。至于绥德分区所属横山、米脂、葭县、镇川等县的部分地区，则因遭受雹灾歉收，仍需救济。
