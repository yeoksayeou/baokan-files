　　During the Capture of Baoding Battle
  　Our Army Bravely Bombed and Assaulted; Civilian Laborers Actively Assisted in Combat
    [Jizhong Electric] Frontline reporter Li Fu reports: During the battle to capture Baoding, the morale of the participating troops and civilian laborers was high. After the battle began, Instructor Feng of the "Courageous" 8th Company said to everyone, "Liu Huanan is the unit we cleared the way for. Keep your cool, the time to exchange guns, earn merit, and join the Party has come!" Following that, Tian Lidong of the blasting team proposed, "I'll hold the first one." Zhang Xin, the ladder team leader, said, "After the blasting completes its mission, we guarantee the ladders will be secure." Wang Lifang, the assault team leader, said, "After the blasting completes its mission, we guarantee to rush up bravely, occupy the forward position, and drive out the enemy." The medical team proposed, "No matter how tense the situation, we guarantee not to lose a single wounded soldier." Lei Xicai was in the firepower team, and he requested to earn merit and join the Party, so he automatically joined the blasting team. During the battle, the heroes' vows were all realized. Under the cover of our heavy firepower, the blasting was completed in fifteen minutes, and the troops, led by Instructor Chu and Company Commander Zhao, charged bravely. Company Commander Liu Jingbo was wounded in the face but continued to command. Soldier Lei Xicai was wounded in the hand, but after completing the blasting mission, he joined the assault team. The "Courageous" 7th Company fought during the day and dug fortifications and modified the terrain at night, without rest. The civilian laborers from Lixian, Anping, and Qingyuan all used their strength to actively help the troops dig fortifications and rescue the wounded. The 2nd squad of the 3rd company of the Anping stretcher team competed to carry out the missions after they arrived, willing to stay at the front with the army rather than transporting from the rear. Zhang Wushen, the company headquarters communicator, braved enemy gunfire and automatically went to the front line to carry a wounded soldier back. In addition to completing cooking tasks, the 2nd squad cook also went to the front to carry wounded soldiers. Bai Ruihai and Liu Xintian, seeing that the wounded soldiers were cold, took off their robes and quilts to cover them. The civilian laborers from Lixian hid the wounded soldiers first when the planes came, and then hid themselves. The civilian laborers from Qingyuan dug fortifications near the city under the enemy's artillery blockade, without stopping all night. A civilian laborer from Liu Zhihui Village had his cotton sleeve torn by shrapnel, but he was not timid. He said, "Once we take Baoding, we will be settled and can live a peaceful life. This hardship is for the future." The villagers near Baoding also helped the People's Liberation Army carry the wounded and deliver ammunition. Everywhere you could hear the villagers happily saying, "Taking Baoding will mean we can enjoy the same blessings as in the South!"
    [Baoding Frontline Electric] During this battle for the Liberation Army to liberate Baoding, the broad masses of the people in the ninth sub-district of Jizhong enthusiastically supported the front. Village cadres, party members, and the masses from eight counties including Anxin, Qingyuan, Gaoyang, and Anping, formed twenty-eight stretcher companies, thirteen militia companies, and nine breaching companies, a total of more than six thousand five hundred people, as well as a large cart team, work teams, carpenter classes and so on, successively poured to the front with the army. Some militia companies and work teams escorted prisoners, and some fought enemy stragglers. During the battle, they took on major responsibilities such as communication, liaison, sentry duty, and security. They were as close to the Liberation Army as blood brothers. To reduce the suffering of the wounded, some civilian stretcher bearers automatically dispersed into the companies and battalions like the army stretcher bearers, braving artillery fire to rescue the wounded. Bai Genshui, a civilian laborer from Shenze, seeing that a wounded soldier could not urinate, helped the wounded soldier urinate. When the wounded soldier was hungry, he bought the wounded soldier eggs and sesame candy to eat. The wounded soldiers were very moved.
    In the villages the troops passed through, the masses rushed to be guides and comfort the wounded soldiers. The women of Yuanjiaqiao heard that the Liberation Army was passing through the village, so they busied themselves collecting eggs, steamed buns, boiling water, etc., and put them on the street for the passing soldiers to eat. Shi Songzhan's wife and Meng Jinzhong's mother saw that the wounded soldiers' hands could not move, so they broke the eggs and poured them into the wounded soldiers' mouths, lit cigarettes and put them in the wounded soldiers' mouths so they could smoke. This Liberation Army campaign to liberate Baoding further stimulated the masses' enthusiasm for paying grain. When the troops passed through Da Hou Village, the village cadres were broadcasting loudly on the roof to rush to collect the autumn public grain. The masses carried it and beat it, rushing to pay. People were all smiling and discussing: "Hand it over quickly! Seeing the troops heading west, this time they are definitely attacking Baoding, and we must make sure they eat their fill. We will soon be living a peaceful life!"

    【保定前线电】这次解放军解放保定战役中，冀中九分区广大人民踊跃支前，安新、清苑、高阳、安平等八个县的村干党员、群众，组成二十八个担架连，十三个民兵连，九个破击连，共六千五百余人，还有大车队、武工队、木匠班等，先后随军涌上前线。民兵连、武工队，有的押解俘虏，有的打敌散兵。在战斗中他们担任了通讯、联络、放哨、警戒等重大责任。他们和解放军象亲弟兄般亲热。为减少伤员痛苦，有的民工担架自动和部队担架同样分散到连营冒着炮火去抢救伤员。深泽民工白根水，见伤员不能撒尿，他给伤员攒着小便撒尿，伤员饿了给伤员买鸡蛋麻糖吃。伤员很受感动。
    部队所过村庄，群众抢着当向导，慰劳伤员。苑家桥妇女听说解放军在该村过，就忙着敛鸡蛋、饽饽、烧开水等，摆到大街上给过往的战士吃。史松占媳妇、孟进忠他娘见伤员的手不能动，他们把鸡蛋磕破，往伤员嘴里灌，把纸烟点着，送到伤员嘴里让他抽。这次解放军解放保定的战役中，更兴奋了群众缴粮情绪，部队经过大侯村时村干部正在房上高声广播赶征秋季公粮，群众担的担打的打，争先缴纳。人们都笑盈盈地议论着：“快交吧！看部队一个劲的向西开，这回准是打保定，一定叫他们吃的饱饱的，眼看就过上安生日子了！”
