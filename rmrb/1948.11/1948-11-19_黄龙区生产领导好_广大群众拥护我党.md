Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 10th. Party, government, and military personnel in the newly liberated Huanglong sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region are vigorously leading and organizing peasants in production, gaining the enthusiastic support of the broad masses. This sub-district was newly liberated in March of this year. Due to the previous conscription by bandits, there is a relative lack of labor, making it urgently necessary to organize mutual aid in labor exchange. Middle peasants account for the majority of the area's population. A small number of landlords and rich peasants mostly manage their land by hiring laborers, and the relationship of renting land is not widespread. The majority of peasants in the area request assistance in improving farming methods and resolving difficulties in production. However, some of them, due to a lack of understanding of our Party's policies, still have concerns about becoming wealthy through labor and developing their production. Based on the above situation, cadres in the area focused on publicizing the policy of developing production and becoming wealthy through labor, and helping the masses solve concrete difficulties in this year's production leadership. Cadres from Hancheng gathered villagers in Kangjiawan and Shanqiao villages to publicize becoming wealthy through labor, exposing rumors spread by bad elements to sabotage wheat planting, greatly increasing the peasants' enthusiasm for production. The cadres of the county also recommended to the peasants the "Shaannong No. 7 wheat variety" (commonly known as "Xia Ba Dou" – meaning that even in years of poor harvest, each mu can still yield eight dou, and its harvest is 25% higher than ordinary wheat) which has high yield and strong disease resistance. The Hancheng County Government exchanged all eight shi of this type of wheat seed stored in the county's farm to the peasants. Cadres from the Fifth District of Yijun City, together with rural cadres, mobilized 926 people and 584 head of cattle in the range of five townships, organized 178 mutual aid groups, and promptly sowed 15,135 mu of wheat fields, an increase of 750 mu compared to the past, based on the principles of equal value and voluntary participation. The concept of mutual assistance was established in the minds of the peasants, helping wheat-planting households who lacked labor to plant in a timely manner. Gongzhuang Village in a township in the Huangling mountainous area often failed to plant crops before liberation due to a lack of labor and animal power. After liberation, under the leadership of the democratic government, labor exchange groups were organized, and all 270 mu of wheat fields in the village were completely planted in just ten days. Peasants in various places believe that the democratic government's leadership in production is a new and important event in their political life. The peasants said: "In the past, the Kuomintang government only asked from the people and did not care about their survival. Now, the cadres of our democratic government are busy all day to lead our production. The Communist Party truly cares about the people."

　　黄龙区生产领导好
  　广大群众拥护我党
    【新华社西北十日电】陕甘宁边区新解放之黄龙分区党政军工作人员，大力领导与组织农民进行生产，获得广大群众热诚拥护。该分区是今年三月新解放的地区，由于过去胡匪抓丁的结果，劳动力比较缺乏，亟需组织变工互助。该区中农占多数，为数不多的地主富农，多以雇工方式经营自己的土地，租佃关系不普遍。该区大多数农民要求帮助改良农作法及解决生产中的困难。但其中有些人因不了解我党的政策，对劳动致富、生产发家尚有顾虑。根据上述各种情况在该区干部在今年领导生产中，着重宣传发展生产劳动致富的政策，帮助群众解决具体困难。韩城干部在康家湾与陕桥等村，召集村民大会，宣传劳动致富，揭发坏人破坏种麦的谣言，农民生产情绪大为提高。该县干部并向农民推荐产量高、抗病力强的“陕农七号麦种”（俗名“瞎八斗”——即收成不好年份，每亩也可打八斗的意思，其收获量比一般麦子高百分之二十五）。韩城县政府将该县农场所积存的此类麦种八石，全部换给农民。宜君城五区干部协同乡村干部，根据等价自愿的原则，在五个乡的范围内，发动九百二十六人与五百八十四犋牛力，组织一百七十八个互助小组，及时播种麦田一万五千一百三十五亩，较过去增种七百五十亩。在农民思想上树立了互助观念，帮助缺乏劳力的种麦户及时下种。黄陵山区一乡龚庄村解放前常因缺乏劳力、畜力，而使庄稼种不上。解放后，在民主政府的领导下，组织变工组，全村二百七十多亩麦田，只十天即全部种完。各地农民认为民主政府领导生产是他们政治生活中一件新鲜大事。农民们说：“过去国民党政府，光向老百姓要，不管老百姓死活。现在我们民主政府的干部，为领导我们生产，整日奔忙。共产党真正体贴老百姓。”
