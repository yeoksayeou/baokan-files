To the Editorial Department:

During the land reform last year, because there were no clear regulations for classifying class status at that time, many middle peasants (or well-to-do middle peasants) who started by their own labor were wrongly classified as landlords and rich peasants. Some villages have not thoroughly corrected this deviation, or the compensation is very small, and the wrongly classified households have difficulty making a living. In this autumn grain collection, can their public grain be reduced?

Answer: The principle of public grain burden is to collect it in proportion to income, that is, whoever cultivates the land, harvests the crop, and bears the burden; those who do not cultivate the land and have no income do not bear the burden. If the wrongly struggled against middle peasants should be compensated but have not been compensated, or the compensation is very small, and they have difficulty making a living, the burden may be reduced or exempted appropriately according to the actual situation.

    错斗中农的公粮是否可以减征？编辑同志：
    在去年土改中，因为那时划阶级没有明确的规定，把不少劳动起家的中农（或富裕中农）错订为地主、富农，有些村庄尚未彻底纠正偏向，或是补偿很少，错斗户生活困难。象这样是否在秋征中少征他们的公粮呢？
    答：公粮负担原则是按收入比例征收，就是谁种谁收谁负担，不种地无收入的不负担。如被斗中农应该补偿而尚未补偿或补偿的很少，生活困难者，可依据实际情况酌量减少或豁免负担。
