Two Deviations to Prevent in This Winter's Loan Work
    Wu Jiang
    The North China People's Government's instructions on winter loan work, published on October 20th, pointed out that the purpose of loans is to develop production, using loans to solve the difficulties and needs of the working people in production. At the same time, loans must be borrowed and repaid, and returned on schedule. It opposes and corrects the past loan work's perspective of charity and relief based on living difficulties and the one-sided viewpoint of poor and hired peasants. It also pointed out that the primary task is to enable cadres to master the loan policy, which, as the instructions said, is the main problem in loan work. In our region, where land reform has been basically completed, it is absolutely necessary to implement the above-mentioned agricultural loan policy.
    However, the accumulated malpractices in our past implementation of agricultural loan policies do not stop there. For example, the state bank delivers the funds to the local government, and the local government distributes the funds to the villages level by level. In this process, due to the lack of thorough investigation and calculation and a systematic lending institution to control the system, egalitarianism and laissez-faire phenomena occurred, turning "loans" into "pushing funds." Pushing funds down level by level like this, problems arose when the "push" reached the village-level cadres. Before the land reform, the problems that occurred in agricultural loans were mostly the rich peasant line of proceeding "from relatives, family members, or friends who have relationships with cadres" and "taking the ability to repay as a condition for lending." The degree of harm it caused was no less than the charitable relief view "based on living difficulties."
    Based on the above situation, in future agricultural loan work, in addition to determining the principle that "the loan target is all active productive working people, as long as they are engaged in production, they have the same right to obtain loans," in the actual implementation, two deviations should be opposed:
    In rural areas where land has just been equally divided, although farmers have obtained land, the production capacity of laboring farmers is not equal (nor can it be equal). Therefore, there are also inequalities in loan needs and loan capabilities. Therefore, on the one hand, laboring farmers who have loan needs and have sufficient loan capacity should be given the same right to loans. If this right is deprived or restricted in an attempt to achieve "average" development of the rural economy through loans and pursue the so-called "equal rural productivity," this would be a mistake of agricultural socialism. But on the other hand, for those poor and hired laboring farmers who have newly acquired land, have loan needs, but still lack sufficient loan capacity for the time being (that is to say, there are still obstacles and difficulties in completely liberating labor), the leadership should not only but must also use loans as an important means to support and organize their production; the best way should be to organize farmers' production and marketing cooperatives, organize small-producer farmers, and support the development of the small-scale economy to achieve the complete liberation of rural productive forces and the prosperity of the rural economy. This is an important issue in current agricultural loans. The "one-sided view of poor and hired peasants" should be eliminated, but attention to the development of the production of poor and hired farmers who have newly obtained land after land reform should not be neglected. The original instructions stipulated that "the amount of loans, in general, depends on the difficulties and needs of producers," clearly stating that those who currently have such difficulties and needs and reach the most urgent level are roughly these newly acquired poor and hired farmers. Although they have obtained land, they lack the necessary production tools and agricultural funds; they also lack sufficient management capabilities. This constitutes the relative weakness of their loan capacity. If in future agricultural loan work, we do not pay attention to carrying out the necessary organization and support work, organize farmers into cooperatives, lend loans through cooperatives, and simply "push" the principle of "borrowing and repaying" to the countryside level by level, it will not completely liberate rural productive forces or achieve little results, and may even lead to new malpractices.
    To do a good job in loan work and avoid the occurrence of the above two deviations, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of production loans, thoroughly correct the laissez-faire "pushing funds" phenomenon, and carry out truly led and purposeful loan work, not only to determine the principle of "borrowing and repaying," but also to have a set of loan organizations and systems that guarantee "borrowing and repaying" (those that already exist should be strengthened). This is very necessary for the North China Liberated Area today, which is dominated by production and construction.

　　今冬贷款工作中应防止的两种偏向
    吴江
    十月二十日报载华北人民政府关于冬季贷款工作的指示，指出贷款的目的为了发展生产，把贷款用于解决劳动人民生产中的困难与需要，同时贷款必须有借有还，并要按期归还。反对与纠正过去贷款工作中从生活困难出发的恩赐救济观点与片面贫雇观点。并指出首先要使干部能掌握贷款政策，这诚如指示中所说，是贷款工作中的主要问题。在土改业已基本完成的我区，贯彻上述农贷政策是完全必需的。
    然而过去我们在执行农贷政策上的积弊尚不止此，例如，国家银行将款交付地方政府，地方政府又逐级将款分配到村，这一过程中，由于领导上缺乏周密的调查计算与系统的借贷机构，来掌握制度，致发生平均主义与放任自流现象，使“贷款”变成了“推款”。将款如此逐级下“推”，等“推”到村级干部身上，便流弊百出了。土改前在农贷上所发生之毛病，大抵是“从与干部有关系的亲戚本家或朋友”出发和“以能还得起为借贷的条件”的富农路线。其为害程度并不比“从生活困难出发”的恩赐救济观点为轻。
    基于上述情况，今后农贷工作中，除确定“贷款对象是一切积极生产的劳动人民，只要进行生产，都有获得贷款的同等权利”的原则以外，在实际执行中应反对两种偏向：
    在土地甫经平分后的农村中，虽然农民均获得土地，但劳动农民间的生产能力并不相等（亦不能相等），因此在贷款需要与贷款能力上，也同样表现了不相等。所以一方面对于有贷款需要而又有充足贷款能力的劳动农民，应给予贷款的同等权利，如对于这一权利加以剥夺或限制，企图以贷款达到农村经济的“平均”发展，追求所谓“相等的农村生产力”，这就犯了农业社会主义的错误。但另一方面，对于那些新获得土地、有贷款需要、但一时尚缺乏充足贷款能力（也就是说在完全解放劳动力上还有阻碍和困难）的一部分贫雇劳动农民，领导上不但应该而且必须以贷款作为扶植与组织其生产的一种重要手段；最好的办法，应该是组织农民的生产的和供销的合作社，把小生产者的农民组织起来，扶植小农经济向前发展，以达完全解放农村生产力繁荣农村经济之目的。这是当前农贷中的一个重要问题。“片面贫雇观点”应当取消，但照顾土改后新得到土地的贫雇农生产之发展，则不应因之受到忽视。原指示中规定“贷款之多少先后一般根据生产者的困难与需要”，明确的说，目前有此困难与需要，达到最迫切程度者，大致还是此种新获得土地的贫雇农民。他们虽获得土地，然而缺少必需的生产工具与农业资金；亦缺少足够的经营能力。如此构成其贷款能力的相对薄弱。今后农贷工作中如不注意进行必需的组织和扶植工作，将农民组织到合作社里面去，把贷款通过合作社贷出，而想以“有借有还”的原则简单的逐级“推”行于农村，则不能完全解放农村生产力或收效甚微，甚至会发生新的流弊。
    要做好贷款工作避免上述两种偏向的发生，必须加强生产贷款的领导，将放任自流的“推款”现象彻底纠正，进行真正有领导有目的的贷款工作，不仅确定“有借有还”的原则，而且要有一套保证“有借有还”的贷款组织与制度（已有的应加强）。这对今天以生产建设为主的华北解放区，是非常必要的。
