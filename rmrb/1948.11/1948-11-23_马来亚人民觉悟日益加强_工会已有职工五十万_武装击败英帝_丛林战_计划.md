Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. TASS Moscow dispatch: "Labor Daily" published an article entitled "The Truth About the Development of the Situation in Malaya," which stated: "The 'Malayan problem' has received considerable attention from the British press in the past four months. The British ruling group, already mired in the Marshall Plan, is frantically trying to obtain money by cruelly exploiting the colonial people in order to pay off debts to its overseas creditors - this is the actual significance of Britain's special 'attention' to the 'Malayan problem.'" (Note: Malaya supplies Britain with approximately $200 million in foreign exchange annually due to the export of rubber and tin to the United States.) Malaya's rubber production increases year after year, while the living standards of the working people continue to decline. Working conditions on rubber plantations are already extremely harsh. Now, a true slave regime has been imposed on Malayan workers. This is because the United States has determined a task of storing 700,000 tons of strategic rubber materials. In order to cater to the whims of overseas creditors and to squeeze as many dollars as possible out of Malaya, modern "rubber seekers" are painstakingly ensuring that the fate of the Malayan people is destined for starvation and death.

However, the people of Malaya do not intend to tolerate the fate of slavery arranged for them by others. The organization and national awareness of the Malayan people have been greatly strengthened compared to before the war. The trade union movement has grown unprecedentedly. Unions now have approximately 500,000 workers. Together with the democratic organizations that led the anti-Japanese war during the war - the People's Anti-Japanese Army, the Communist Party, and the New Democratic Youth League - the unions are actively fighting for Malayan independence and the basic rights of the working people.

The increase in union influence has angered the rubber planters and their foreign accomplices. Government labor authorities have begun sending various union "advisors" with experience in safeguarding the interests of employers to various unions, attempting to "tame" the unions. After the British authorities' attempt to establish puppet unions to "counteract" the Pan-Malayan Federation of Trade Unions completely failed, they decided to suppress the labor movement by force. The British authorities declared the Pan-Malayan Federation of Trade Unions illegal in June of this year, in order to "encourage" the union movement. Then, they launched large-scale searches in rural and urban areas to arrest union leaders who had gone underground. The British authorities have launched large-scale military operations in Malaya. Troops, aircraft, and warships have been sent to Malaya to participate in the suppression of the people who are determined to resist the oppressors and have entered the jungle in large numbers. The British Pacific Fleet has almost completely concentrated in Singapore. London docks are piled high with armored vehicles and boxes of munitions marked for "Singapore" and "Kuala Lumpur." The strength of the British armed forces in Malaya is estimated at 50,000. Not only are there garrison troops, but also cannibalistic "Dayak" troops from Borneo are participating in military operations on the Malay Peninsula. In addition, a group of police dogs specially trained to search for victims in swamps and jungles has also been transported to Singapore. The whole of Malaya has become a scene of a true "people hunt"; the authorities are using methods such as "searching" forests, burning villages, arresting, and killing. Among the victims of British colonial terror are hundreds of active union workers and anti-Japanese heroes.

News from Britain shows that the working people are increasingly resolutely coming forward to defend the Malayan people's demand for the withdrawal of British troops from Malaya. The London "Daily Worker" pointed out that the British people are increasingly clearly aware that the brutal war Britain is waging in Malaya is closely related to every British man and woman, and it endangers their hope for peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Reports from various sources: The British colonialists' "jungle warfare" plan to suppress the Malayan people's armed resistance has once again proven to be a failure. British colonialists have long boasted about their carefully formulated "jungle warfare" plan. Three months ago, they transported 200 Dayak savages from Sarawak, Borneo, in an attempt to drive these savages into the deep forests to search for personnel from the People's Anti-British Army. They also transferred so-called "elite troops" - the Scottish Guards Brigade and the Fourth Light Cavalry - from distant England. But now their plan has been declared a failure. The Dayak savages, who have only become a laughing stock, have recently been airlifted back to Sarawak by the British army.

The only skill of the British colonialists now is true "murder and arson." They do not hesitate to adopt the most bloody suppression methods against the people of Malaya, who are their "dollar-making factory." The British army, since the 9th of this month, "has begun to carry out large-scale massacres against the Malayan people. They divided areas including many square miles into small blocks, and the British air force carried out successive bombings and strafing, regardless of whether those killed were guerrillas or innocent villagers" (Diantong News Agency). At the same time, ground British troops carried out mass burning and killing in certain states, attempting to create "no-man's lands." In Kajang Village, south of Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Selangor State, 60 residents' houses and shops were completely burned down by British troops, leaving 400 people homeless. In Perak State, the British army burned down more than 300 farmhouses in only two communities, leaving more than 800 people homeless. However, this frantic behavior of the British army, which is hostile to the people, will inevitably arouse a more resolute struggle by the Malayan people. According to British official admissions, British regular troops and their local henchmen have had more than 250 people killed by guerrillas since June, not including the wounded.

### 马来亚人民觉悟日益加强　工会已有职工五十万  武装击败英帝“丛林战”计划

　　马来亚人民觉悟日益加强
  　工会已有职工五十万
    武装击败英帝“丛林战”计划
    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报刊载题为“马来亚局势发展真相”一文，略称：过去四个月内，“马来亚问题”受到英国报界的颇大注意。已陷入马歇尔计划泥淖中的英国统治集团正在疯狂地试图借残忍剥削殖民地人民来获得金钱以向其海外的债主偿付债务——这就是英国对“马来亚问题”特别“注意”的实际意义所在。（按：马来亚由于树胶与锡的对美输出，每年供给英国约两亿美元的外汇。）马来亚的树胶出产年年增加，而劳动人民的生活水准却继续不断地下降。橡胶园中的工作条件本已极端艰苦。现在，真正的奴隶政权又被加诸马来亚工人头上。这是由于美国已确定一项要储存七十万吨橡胶战略物资的任务。为了要迎合海外债主的脾胃，为了要从马来亚尽量挤出美元来，现代化的“橡胶搜求者”正在处心积虑地使马来亚人民的命运要注定挨饿和断送性命。
    但是马来亚的人民并不打算容忍别人给他们安排的奴隶命运。马来亚人民的组织与民族觉悟，已比战前大大加强。工会运动已空前地增长起来。工会现在已拥有职工约五十万人。工会正在与战时领导过抗日战争的民主组织——人民抗日军、共产党、新民主青年团——共同积极地为争取马来亚独立及劳动人民基本权利而斗争。
    工会影响的增大，激怒了橡胶园主和他们在外国的同伙。政府劳工当局已开始派遣对于维护………雇主利益富有经验的各种工会“顾问”到各工会去，企图使工会“驯服”。英国当局在企图设立御用的工会以“抵销”泛马来亚工会联合会的企图完全失败后，就决定用武力镇压劳工运动。英国当局在今年六月宣布泛马来亚工会联合会为非法，借以“鼓励”工会运动。然后又在农村及城市中大事搜捕被打入地下的工会领袖。英国当局已在马来亚大规模发动军事行动。部队、飞机及军舰已被派赴马来亚，以参与镇压那些决心抵抗压迫者且已大量进入丛林的人民。英国太平洋舰队几乎已完全集中在新加坡。伦敦码头正堆满着装甲车及标明运往“新加坡”及“吉隆坡”的军火箱。在马来亚的英国武装部队力量据估计达五万人。不仅有警备部队，并且还有来自婆罗洲的吃人般的“达雅克”部队在马来亚半岛参加军事行动。此外，经专门训练用以在沼泽及丛林地带搜索受害者的警犬一群，也已运至新加坡。整个马来亚已出现一幅真正的“捕杀人民”景象；当局使用“搜索”森林、焚毁村庄、逮捕、杀人等种种办法。在英国殖民恐怖下的牺牲者中，有数百名积极的工会工作者及抗日英雄。
    来自英国的消息显示，劳动人民正在愈来愈坚决地出而维护马来亚人民要求英军撤出马来亚的主张。伦敦工人日报指出，英国人民日益清楚地了解到英国在马来亚所进行的野蛮战事乃是与每个英国男女公民切身相关，它危害着他们的和平希望。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】各方报导：英国殖民者镇压马来亚人民武装反抗的“丛林战”计划，再度证明失败。英国殖民者多时以来即曾大肆吹嘘其精心制订的“丛林战”计划。他们在三个月前从婆罗洲的萨拉沙克运来了二百名达雅克野人，企图驱使这些野人到深邃的森林中去搜捕人民抗英军人员。他们又从遥远的英伦调来了所谓“精锐部队”——苏格兰警卫旅及第四轻骑队。但是现在他们的计划已经宣告失败。仅仅成为笑柄的达雅克野人，最近已被英军空运送返萨拉沙克。
    英国殖民者现在的本领就是真正的“杀人放火”。他们对于作为其“美元制造工厂”的马来亚人民，不惜采取最血腥的镇压办法。英军自本月九日起，“已开始对马来亚人民施行大规模的屠杀。他们把包括许多方哩的地区分成小块地区，由英空军施行轮番轰炸及扫射，不管被杀害的是游击队还是无辜村民”（电通社）。同时，地面英军则在某些州内大肆烧杀，企图造成“无人地区”。在雪兰峨州首府吉隆坡以南之卡照村，居民房屋及商铺六十所全被英军纵火焚毁，无家可归者达四百人。在霹雳州，英军仅在两个小区中即焚毁农屋三百余间，无家可归者达八百余人。但是，英军这种与人民为敌的疯狂行为，必将激起马来亚人民更坚决的战斗。据英官方承认，英正规军及其地方爪牙自六月迄今已有二百五十余人为游击队所击毙，伤者尚不在其内。
