　　"Jinan First Regiment"
    Collective Creation by Frontline Reporters
    In the Battle of Jinan, the Zhang-Hu Regiment of the Nie-Liu Column of the East China People's Liberation Army, after continuous battles breaking into the outer city of Jinan, was ordered to attack the inner city from the southeast corner.
    At 6:00 PM on September 23rd, the artillery fire of the general offensive line fiercely bombarded the city walls, and the Third Battalion of the Zhang-Hu Regiment began continuous blasting assaults. Under the cover of artillery fire, Sun Xi, a soldier of the "Ever-Victorious Company" (Seventh Company), first maneuvered and blasted a large bunker and associated defense works in the southeast corner of the city. Subsequently, each group of the blasting platoon jumped into the trenches one after another, passing through the enemy's firepower blockade to carry out continuous blasting. Squad Leader Sun Gaoting crawled to the front of the position to direct operations until the blasting was successfully completed. He reported the reconnaissance information to the company commander, saying, "The breach is wide and large; let's rush up!" However, the enemy frantically counterattacked on the city walls, and the "Ever-Victorious Company" failed three assaults. Several breakthroughs by neighboring units were also blocked, and the battle encountered serious obstacles.
    However, the regiment's commanders had a strong determination. They calmly and nimbly explored the key to victory, preparing to continue the assault. At a military democracy meeting held at a battalion command post, everyone actively and responsibly put forward many specific methods, which were fully approved by the regiment's commanders. Wang Jisheng, the director of the political department, called out, "We are all Communist Party members, cadres, and people's soldiers. We should be tough as iron. At this time, we must be even more brave and tenacious. To complete the mission, we must not hesitate to sacrifice everything!"
    At 1:32 AM, various signals were launched into the night sky from the southeast corner of the city, signaling a renewed attack. After a tense artillery bombardment, Li Guangchen, squad leader of the Seventh Squad of the "Ever-Victorious Company," quickly passed through the firepower blockade, braving the enemy's grenade explosions, and set up the ladder against the city wall. At this moment, Li Yongjiang, the deputy squad leader of the Second Squad, shouted at the foot of the ladder, "Charge! Persist in following me up!" He rushed to the top of the ladder, forcefully grabbing the collapsed loose soil and gravel on the wall, and was the first to break onto the city wall. One after another, squad after squad, they climbed onto the wall. Political Instructor Peng Chao was wounded, but he gritted his teeth and bravely climbed the wall. Twice, the medic pulled him back, but he waved his hand and said, "Who won't let me capture the enemy? I'd rather my blood be spilled on the city!" Finally, he climbed onto the top of the wall. Li Yongjiang rushed into the meteorological station, the highest point of the entire city adjacent to the corner of the city, single-handedly capturing more than 20 enemies and seizing two machine guns and more than ten rifles. Machine Gun Squad Leader Feng Liguo climbed onto the city wall, unarmed, seized a grenade that an enemy was pulling the pin on, and then punched down an enemy next to him. Soldier Yu Hongduo led a group and rushed into the meteorological station, seized a hot machine gun, turned around, and grabbed the barrel of a gun coming towards him, throwing it aside. Soldier Xiao Teng took the opportunity to fire a shot and seized another submachine gun. Company Commander of the Fourth Company, despite his injuries, calmly directed operations, opening a bloody path through the breach.
    The Eighth and Ninth Companies of the Third Battalion followed closely, rushing onto the city wall and developing towards the west wing. The sound of gunfire and grenades on the city wall grew increasingly intense. The brave soldiers fought independently, either individually, in groups, or in squads. On the left side of the city wall, soldier Song Bingke fired his submachine gun while throwing grenades. When

　　“济南第一团”
    前线记者集体创作
    华东人民解放军聂刘纵队张胡团，在解放济南之战中，经过突入济南外城的连续战斗后，又奉命从东南角进攻内城。
    九月二十三日下午六时，全线总攻的炮火猛轰城垣，张胡团三营开始连续爆破突击。“常胜连”（七连）战士孙喜在炮火掩护下首先机动爆破了城东南角一个大地堡和附防工事。接着爆破排的各个组都先后跳下壕沟，穿过敌火力封锁，进行连续爆破，六班长孙高亭爬在阵地前沿指挥，直到爆破已胜利完成。他将侦察所得的情况报告连长说：“缺口打得又宽又大，往上突吧！”但敌人在城垣上拚命反扑，“常胜连”三次突击未成，友邻部队几次突破也受阻，战斗遇到了严重阻碍。
    然而团的指挥员们有着坚强的决心，他们冷静而敏捷的探求着夺取胜利的关键，准备继续突击。在某营指挥所召开的军事民主会上，大家积极负责的提出了许多具体办法，团的指挥员完全批准了这些意见。政治处主任王济生号召：“我们都是共产党员、干部和人民战士，应该是个硬骨头，这个时候要更英勇顽强，为了完成任务，不惜牺牲一切！”
    夜半，一时三十二分，城东南角重新发起各色讯号，划破夜空。一阵紧张的炮轰之后，“常胜连”七班长李光臣迅速通过火力封锁，冒着敌人的手榴弹爆炸，将梯子架上城墙。这时，二班长李永江在梯脚下大喝一声：“突！坚持跟我突上去！”他抢先登上梯顶，用力抓住墙上倒塌的松土碎石，首先突上城墙，接着一个跟一个，一班接一班的登上了城去。指导员彭超负了伤，他咬紧牙关奋勇登城，两次被卫生员拉住，他将手一挥说：“谁还不让我抓敌人吗？我的血宁死也要流在城上！”终于爬上城头。李永江冲进紧依城角的全城制高点气象台，只身单枪，生俘敌二十多名，缴获机枪二挺、步枪十余支。机枪班长冯立国登上城头，赤手空拳夺下一个敌人正在扣弦的手榴弹，再一拳打倒了身旁的一个敌人。战士于洪铎领一个组接着冲进气象台，夺了一挺滚烫的机枪，转身来又掐住迎面过来的敌人枪身，往旁一摔，战士小滕趁势一枪，又缴了一支冲锋式。四连长带伤沉着指挥，打开突破口前的一条血路。
    三营八、九连紧跟着冲上城头，向西翼发展。城头上枪声、榴弹声越来越激烈。勇士们一个人、一个组、一个班分散独立地战斗着。在城头左侧，战士宋炳科拿起冲锋枪边打边掷手榴弹；敌反扑危急时，就直起腰来打。战士葛子芳和焦文元负伤后互相包扎，和部队失掉了联系，就单独坚持，直到后来自动加入六连作战。班长冯立国的嘴腮、唇和眼角蹦进了六块弹片，昏了过去，醒来就一把抹去脸上混血的泥土，又爬起来打。班长郑田芳右手打坏了，就用左手打，实在支持不下去了，战士戴成武就自动建议班副代理班长，自己代理班副，继续领导全班作战。勇士们就这样顽强地击退了敌精锐十五旅一个团在左侧凶恶地不间断地反击。
    在城头右侧，敌十五旅通讯营拥上来又退回去，班长于清林和战士谭洪业拔开手榴弹盖，战士柳成江和班长王其鹏接过来就往外打，一个一个来不及，一下子就掷出去三个，掷光一箱又一箱。手榴弹掷完了，王其鹏就拾起地上一把刀向敌人掷去。
    天将拂晓，弹药快打完了，敌人还在作最后的反扑，张团长哑着噪子在城上鼓励大家：“同志们！没有子弹用刺刀，没有子弹用牙咬！”经过三小时的激战，勇士们终于把一面“打进济南府”的大红旗高插在内城头上。
    敌人的反扑被最后打垮了，三营八连马上跳下城去。城下一片乌黑，孔祥林跌破了膝盖；张佃英摔倒了爬起来又向前冲；龚管理排长拿了一大把手榴弹跳下去跌昏了，醒过来又拾起弹药继续前进。八连一直打到敌人团部，俘获敌人一个排，打退了敌人几面夹击，为后续下城部队开辟了一条前进的道路。
    与八连下城同时，二营也迅速登城、下城，大胆突击，一直向西北打到敌人背后，勇猛分割敌人，打退敌多次猛扑，直捣省政府，又击退敌坦克车和装甲车的反扑。六连并占领警察训练所，夺下百余辆汽车、十几门山炮和七辆装甲车。
    我各路部队突入城内后，包围圈愈缩愈紧，敌人抵抗愈来愈弱。不久，四连又跃先炸开旧省府围墙，夺下榴弹炮和山炮，五分钟内就发展了五百米达。在平泉胡同，战士们又活捉了敌人最后一辆坦克。
    下午四点五十五分，各路强攻部队胜利会师芙蓉街，攻下了王耀武最后巢穴新省政府。张胡团就这样不停息的进攻，半天打进了三里。“常胜连”从城东南突破口一直向西，转而拐向西北角，他们整整走遍了内城半边地区。
    在战斗中，张胡团指挥员们实践了自己的誓言：“坚决遵守华东军区约法七章，坚决执行兵团部的十项规定。”五连打进省政府时，即派岗看守广播电台，剪断了敌人埋设的炸药弦。二连通讯员小于被敌人的火焰喷射器烧毁了身上的衣服、鞋子，张团长立即将自己穿的裤子脱下了一条给他，并批准他到附近地堡里找双敌人遗下的鞋子。但小于穿上团长的裤子说：“有裤子穿就行了。”他光着膀、赤着脚又去作战了。特务连六班在城内历山顶街侯来臣家挖防空洞，挖出银洋一百九十七块，即四处找寻原主，终将银洋如数归还。战场上丢着许多食品、香烟、糖果和汽水，但一昼夜未进饮食的战士们，宁愿抽着自己的旱烟，阵地上的香烟动也不动。八连七班长崔树峰看押一个排的俘虏，他拒绝了俘虏们给他的钢笔、手表，并向他们讲解我军的纪律与政策。该团对占领区内的仓库都妥加保护，完全没有损失。
    张胡团的这一军政全胜，使他们获得了“济南第一团”的光荣称号。
