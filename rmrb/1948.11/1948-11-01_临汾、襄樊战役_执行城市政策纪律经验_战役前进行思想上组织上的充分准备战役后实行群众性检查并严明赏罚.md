    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. How to ensure that troops can well implement city policies and discipline? This is an important issue for the People's Liberation Army in urban warfare today. The Linfen and Xiangfan campaigns not long ago provided the following noteworthy experiences in this regard.
    To enable troops to effectively implement urban policies and discipline, first, full ideological and organizational preparations must be made before the battle.
    According to the experience of Linfen, before the battle, the idea of violating urban policies and discipline was still quite common in the troops. Some of the troops attacking Linfen were newly promoted from local armed forces to the main force, with very strong guerrilla habits, and fundamentally lacked the concept of urban policies and discipline; although some were veteran troops and had undergone urban policy and discipline education, they had not been strictly enforced in the past. The results of each inspection showed that those who violated discipline were not given appropriate punishment, and many of them were cadres. A small number of cadres and soldiers regarded the policy and discipline education and enforcement regulations as mere formalities. Many people made secret plans to take some things into the city to solve personal difficulties. Their thinking was: "We don't take things from the common people, but the enemy's things on the battlefield are exchanged for blood, how can we not take them? We hand over the big things to the public, what is the point of handing over the small things to the public?" Some small units also wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to grab a handful and make a small fortune.
    Therefore, before the battle, the leading organs must use all possible time to widely and deeply conduct urban policy education and ideological mobilization to abide by policy and discipline. The experiences of the Linfen and Xiangfan campaigns have both proven that the central key to doing this work well is to get through to the cadres' thinking. Before the Linfen campaign, the leading organs first put forward the two major tasks of fighting Linfen at the cadre meetings above the battalion level: to fight well and to implement urban policies and discipline well. It was pointed out that as long as the cadres can lead by example and be responsible for educating and managing the soldiers, policy and discipline will certainly be well implemented. Make the cadres accept the implementation of policy and discipline as a task as important as fighting. Make everyone ideologically realize the importance of protecting and building the city for the revolution. At the same time, the leading organs made special decisions, issued instructions, and carried out repeated education and supervision. Those who had violated discipline in the past were criticized and punished, and those who had done well in enforcing discipline were commended. This created an upsurge in the whole army to study policies and abide by discipline. Many cadres and soldiers said: "Our bloodshed and sacrifice are not for the victory of the revolution. If the policy and discipline are destroyed and the revolution suffers losses, it will not be worth it! Life can be given up, why must we have those little things?" The companies generally put forward slogans such as "Say what you do, compare after the war." and "Not only be a hero in fighting, but also make contributions to discipline," and launched a competition to abide by discipline and make contributions.
    Before the Xiangfan campaign, after getting through to the cadres' thinking, the leading organs mobilized the entire army to fight for the correct implementation of policies and to ensure good discipline. Establish clear policy thinking so that everyone understands the advantages and disadvantages of policy implementation for the entire army and individuals. Many company and platoon cadres expressed their determination to register their belongings and asked everyone to supervise them. If they found "getting rich," they were willing to be punished. Under this influence, the soldiers also automatically expressed their attitudes, registered things (do not force them), and launched a pledge, inspection, and supervision movement to abide by urban policies and discipline. The soldiers said: "If the policies are done well, the people will welcome us." "If we do it well this time, it will affect Wuhan, Jiangnan, and Sichuan." "People (referring to the brother Liberation Army) did a good job in Luoyang and Kaifeng, and we will not be qualified to enter the city if we don't do well."
    In addition to these ideological mobilizations, necessary organizational preparations must also be made before the battle begins. Before the Xiangfan campaign, the leading organs specially organized discipline inspection teams and material collection groups. The inspection team was organized by battalion and unified under the upper-level and city defense inspection teams. Each battalion formed a group of three to five people, and the regimental and brigade headquarters controlled a group. The task of the inspection team was to inspect the implementation of policies and discipline by each unit. The material collection group consisted of five or more people in each battalion, four groups in each regiment, and a group in the brigade headquarters, all under the unified leadership of the City Assets Committee. The battalion collection group should be responsible for focusing on collecting scattered items discarded by the enemy and weapons and ammunition not taken away by the troops. After collection, they should be handed over to the Assets Committee for transportation or unified distribution. No individual may take it away privately.
    Second, during the battle, in addition to giving play to the role of the discipline inspection team and the material collection group, the troops should be immediately assembled after a battle is resolved, so that no one can act freely. Cleaning up the battlefield must be in order, and people must be sent to guard important materials and public places. It is especially important to launch mass supervision and encouragement, implement urban policies and discipline, stop those who violate discipline at any time, and commend those who have good discipline.
    In the Xiangfan campaign, the enemy abandoned a lot of complete and scattered materials, and some soldiers were red-eyed when they saw them and their hearts were shaken. During the battle review, some soldiers reflected and said: "I really wanted to take the scattered things that the enemy threw away at the time, but I thought that policies were important and discipline was strict, and I thought that the entire class could not make meritorious service if I violated discipline, so I didn't take it." Under the conscious thought and mass supervision, many soldiers escorting prisoners refused the money or things given to them by the prisoners. The soldiers encouraged each other in combat: "Don't move things, the development of the battle is important!" "Don't take things, capture more prisoners, capture Kang Ze alive!" "If you violate discipline, the whole class can't make meritorious service!" "If you violate the policy, even the reputation of the whole army will not be good!" This mutual supervision, as well as the serious and responsible attitude and exemplary actions of cadres and party members, formed a mass force, and policy discipline was easy to maintain. This is an important link in doing a good job in policy discipline during combat.
    In the Linfen campaign, under this mutual supervision, policy discipline was generally well implemented. There was no infringement of industry and commerce, and no destruction of public buildings. The troops handed over all the scattered daily necessities searched from the battlefield and enemy camps. Many soldiers chased the enemy barefoot. They did not wear the leather shoes abandoned by the enemy, and they did not want cigarettes or biscuits. In many military camps, all materials and articles were not damaged in the slightest after the search.
    Third, after the battle, implement mass inspection, approve the quality of policy discipline execution, and strictly reward and punish. The inspection method should mobilize the self-consciousness of cadres and soldiers, and should not be forced or rigid.
    In the Xiangfan campaign, a special meeting was held after the war to evaluate policy discipline, as seriously as evaluating meritorious service and assessing casualties. And immediately carried out rewards and punishments. Many units and individuals have made meritorious contributions in the implementation of policies and discipline. At the same time, the scattered items seized from the enemy (not prisoners) were handed over to the temporary distribution committee for distribution. The distribution principle was to give better items to the wounded, heroes and models, and to take care of everyone's needs to achieve unity. After the distribution, everyone was satisfied, and they all said: "It is glorious to be able to get a share without taking things. It is embarrassing to take things and not take advantage of them."
    In the post-war review of the Linfen campaign, only a few people took a little bit of scattered things, and they took them out and handed them over to the public. After unified distribution and strict rewards and punishments, the soldiers happily said: "Honest people will not suffer losses." In the past, honest people who did not take things suffered losses. The leading organs at all levels also felt that this not only reduced a lot of trouble, but also enhanced the unity and fraternity of the troops.

    临汾、襄樊战役
    执行城市政策纪律经验
    战役前进行思想上组织上的充分准备战役后实行群众性检查并严明赏罚
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】怎样来保证部队很好地执行城市政策纪律？这是今天人民解放军在攻城作战中的重要问题。不久以前的临汾战役和襄樊战役，在这方面提供了下述的值得注意的经验。
    要使部队能很好地执行城市政策纪律，第一，必须在战役之前进行思想上和组织上的充分准备工作。
    据临汾的经验，在战役之前，部队中违犯城市政策纪律的思想还是相当普遍的。攻临汾部队中有部分是由地方武装新提升为主力的，游击习气非常浓厚，根本缺乏城市政策纪律的观念；一部分虽是老部队，曾经进行过城市政策纪律教育，但因过去执行纪律不严格，每次检查结果，对于违犯纪律的都未给以适当处分，而其中不少的还是干部。有少数干部战士对于政策纪律教育和执行的规定，视为具文。很多人订了暗计划，准备进城拿一些东西解决个人的困难。他们的想法是：“老百姓的东西不拿，战场上敌人的东西是用血换来的，还能不拿？大东西交公，小东西交给公家干啥？”有些小单位，也想趁此抓一把，打点小埋伏。
    因此，在战役之前，领导机关必须利用一切可能利用的时间，广泛而深入地进行城市政策教育和遵守政策纪律的思想动员。临汾与襄樊两次战役的经验都证明，做好这一工作的中心关键是打通干部思想。临汾战役前，领导机关首先就在营以上的干部会上提出打临汾的两大任务：打好仗，执行好城市政策纪律。指出只要干部能以身作则，并负责教育管理战士，政策纪律就一定能执行得好。使干部把政策纪律的执行当作和打仗同等重要的任务来接受。使大家从思想上认识保护与建设城市对于革命的重要性。同时领导机关专门作了决定，发了训令，进行了三翻四覆的教育督促。对过去违犯纪律的人作了批评和处分，对执行纪律好的，作了表扬。这样就造成了全军学习政策与遵守纪律的热潮。许多干部战士都说：“自己流血牺牲还不是为了革命的胜利，要是破坏了政策纪律，使革命受到损失，那才不合算呢！生命都可以不要，为什么一定要那点小东西？”各连队普遍提出了“说到做到，战后对照。”“不单打仗当英雄，还要守纪立双功”等口号，展开了遵纪立功的竞赛。
    在襄樊战役前，领导机关于打通干部思想后，即动员全军为正确执行政策和保证良好纪律而奋斗。树立明确的政策思想，使大家了解政策执行得好坏对全军和个人的利害关系。很多连排干部表示决心，登记自己的财物，要求大家监督，如战后发现“发洋财”，愿受处罚。在这影响下，战士们也自动地表示态度，登记东西（不要强迫），展开了遵守城市政策纪律的宣誓、检查和监督运动。战士们说：“政策搞好了，老百姓欢迎咱们。”“这回搞好了，就一直影响到汉口、江南和四川了。”“人家（按指兄弟解放军）在洛阳、开封搞的很好，咱们搞不好就没有入城资格了。”
    除了这些思想动员以外，在战役开始前，还须进行必要的组织准备。襄樊战役前，领导机关特组织了纪律检查队和物资收集组。检查队以营为单位，统一于上级和城防的检查队，每营以三人至五人组成一个组，团部、旅部掌握一个组，检查组的任务是检查各部队政策纪律的执行。物资收集组每营由五人以上组成，每团有四个组，旅部设一个组，统一由全城资财委员会领导。营收集组应负责着重收集敌人遗弃的零星物品及部队未带走的武器弹药，收集完毕后交资财委员会运出或统一分配。任何个人不得私自拿走。
    第二，在战斗中，除了发挥纪律检查组和物资收集组的作用外，还要在一处战斗解决后即立刻集结部队，不使任何人自由行动。打扫战场要有秩序，派人看守重要资材和公共场所。特别重要的是发动群众性的监督、勉励，贯彻执行城市政策纪律，随时制止违犯纪律的，表扬纪律好的。
    襄樊战役，敌人遗弃的整批和零星的物资很多，有的战士见了眼红，心里动摇。战役检讨时有的战士反省说：“我当时看到敌人丢的零星东西真想拿，但又想到政策要紧，纪律严格，想到犯了纪律全班不能立功，就没有拿。”在思想自觉和群众性的监督下，许多押解俘虏的战士都拒绝了俘虏给他的金钱或东西。战士们在作战中相互鼓励着：“东西不要动哪，发展战斗要紧！”“不拿东西，多捉俘虏，活捉康泽啊！”“你犯了纪律，全班都不能立功啊！”“你犯了政策，连全军名誉都不好！”这种互相监督，以及干部、党员严肃负责的态度与模范行动，形成为群众力量，政策纪律就容易维持，这是战斗中做好政策纪律的重要环节。
    临汾战役，在这种互相监督下，政策纪律一般也执行得很好。没有侵犯工商业，没有破坏公共建筑，部队搜查出战场和敌军营中的零星日用物品都交了公。许多战士赤脚追击敌人，见敌人遗弃的皮鞋也不穿，见纸烟、饼干都不要。许多军营在搜查后一切资材物品均未受丝毫损失。
    第三，在战役后，要实行群众性的检查，许定执行政策纪律的好坏，严明赏罚。检查方式要发动干部、战士的自动自觉，不要强迫生硬。
    襄樊战役，战后专门召开了评定政策纪律的会议，象评功、评定伤亡一样认真。并立即进行了赏罚。好些单位和个人在执行政策纪律上都立了功。同时，将缴获敌人的（不是俘虏的）零星物品交给临时分配委员会负责分配，分配原则是拿较好的给伤员、英雄模范，并照顾各人的需要，达到团结的目的。分配后大家满意，都说：“不拿东西能分到，又光荣。拿了东西不占便宜，还丢人。”
    临汾战役战后检讨中，仅有个别人拿了点零星东西，也拿出来交了公。在统一分配和严格的赏罚后，战士们都高兴地说：“老实人不吃亏了。”而在以前，老实人不拿东西的，则吃了亏。各级领导机关也感到：这样不只减少了许多麻烦，并增强了部队的团结友爱。
