Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Comprehensive reports indicate that the conspiracy to organize a Far East Police Alliance under the control of U.S. imperialism, following Zhang Qun's visit to Japan in mid-September, is being pursued with increasingly futile efforts. As early as the beginning of this year, the U.S. State Department dispatched Kennan to Japan to initiate this conspiratorial activity. The U.S. reactionaries have designated MacArthur as the number one executor of this conspiracy. As a result of the consultations between Zhang Qun, representing Chiang Kai-shek, and MacArthur and the Japanese reactionaries, a plan for a "Far East Anti-Communist Group" based on a "Sino (Kuomintang)-Japanese-Korean Anti-Communist Alliance" was drafted. This plan attempts to suppress the Asian national liberation movement and the people's democratic movement under the smokescreen of "anti-communism." After returning to Nanjing, Zhang Qun published his "Impressions of Japan" on September 28th, trying his best to cover up the fact that U.S. imperialism is fostering Japanese fascist forces and restoring the foundation of Japanese military industry. He reiterated the old tune of "no revenge" against Japan. Furthermore, after these remarks aimed at paralyzing the Chinese people's vigilance against the revival of Japanese militarism, he shamelessly proposed the establishment of an "Asian Regional Economic Group" including Japan. Zhang Qun's new "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" theory won the expected cheers and support from the Japanese reactionary newspapers. Despite the Kuomintang Central Daily News's editorial on October 4th denying the plan for a "Sino (Kuomintang)-Japanese-Korean Alliance," Kuomintang Finance Minister Wang Yunwu admitted at a press conference in Washington on the same day that "China (Kuomintang) and Japan have completed several transactions based on barter trade." He also announced that he was studying the possibility of an Asian economic and political "security alliance" (i.e., a police alliance of the Western European Union type) supported by the United States with officials from other Far East countries, modeled on the Western European Union. In addition, Kuomintang Foreign Minister Wang Shijie "visited" Thailand and India separately when he attended the United Nations General Assembly in September. There is also talk that Zhang Qun will "visit" the Philippines in November. All of these are related to the organization of the Far East Police Alliance. On the side of the puppet South Korea, puppet president Syngman Rhee, during Zhang Qun's visit to Japan, made a statement to a reporter from the Kuomintang Central News Agency about "Sino-Korean joint anti-communism." Later, he also sent a "special envoy," Zhao Bingyu, to Nanjing, Manila, and Washington for activities. Syngman Rhee himself went to Japan on the 19th of this month to visit his master MacArthur. After returning to Seoul, he declared: "The intention announced by the South Korean Foreign Minister to participate in the rumored Asian Anti-Communist Group is South Korea's most appropriate diplomatic policy."

The reactionary activities of the U.S., China, Japan, and South Korea reflect their fear of the Eastern people's democratic revolutionary movement and their own fragility. The Kuomintang reactionary regime is teetering under the hammer blows of the People's Liberation Army. The puppet regime in South Korea, despised by the people, is facing a serious crisis of armed uprisings by the people. The Japanese reactionary government is in a flurry in the face of the continuous exposure of democratic forces and the impact of labor unrest. Their inability to take care of themselves and the instability of their rule prove that U.S. imperialism's policies in these countries have completely failed in the past three years. As for the Philippines, Vietnam, and other Southeast Asian colonial and semi-colonial countries, the flames of the people's armed anti-imperialist struggle are burning everywhere, and the puppet regimes there are equally fragile. Therefore, U.S. imperialism's Far East Police Alliance plan lacks even more foundation than the Pan-American Union and the Western European Union.

    东方遍燃人民革命运动怒火
    美蒋日韩反动派惊恐
    心劳日拙筹组远东警察同盟
    【新华社陕北二日电】综合报导：九月中旬张群访日之后，在美帝国主义控制下的远东警察同盟的筹组阴谋，正被心劳日拙地进行着。远在本年初，美国国务院即派凯南到日本，开始这个阴谋活动。美国反动派并以麦克阿瑟为这一个阴谋的第一号执行人。张群代表蒋介石与麦克阿瑟及日本反动派会商的结果，拟订了以“中（国民党）、日、韩反共同盟”为基础的“远东反共集团”的计划，这个计划妄图在“反共”烟幕下镇压亚洲民族解放运动与人民民主运动。张群回到南京之后，于九月二十八日发表了“日本观感”，极力掩盖美帝国主义扶植日本法西斯势力和恢复日本军事工业基础的事实，重弹对日“不报复”主义的老调，并且在这样目的在麻痹中国人民对日本军国主义复活的警惕性的议论之后，无耻地提出了成立包括日本在内的“亚洲区域经济集团”的主张。张群这套新“大东亚共荣圈”论，博得了日本反动报纸意料中的喝采与支持。尽管国民党中央日报十月四日的社论，一口否认“中（国民党）、日，韩同盟”的计划，但国民党政府财长王云五同一天在华盛顿记者招待会上却承认“中（国民党）日两国已按照物物交换为基础完成若干项交易”，并且宣布他正和远东其他各国官员研究以西欧联盟为蓝本的、由美国支持的亚洲经济政治“安全联盟”（按即西欧联盟型的警察同盟）的可能性。此外，国民党政府外长王世杰于九月间出席联合国大会时，曾分别“访问”了泰国与印度。张群且有将于十一月“访问”菲律宾之说。这都是与筹组远东警察同盟有关的。在伪韩方面，傀儡总统李承晚在张群访日之时，曾对国民党中央社记者发表了“中韩共同防共”的谈话，后来还派遣“特使”赵炳玉到南京、马尼拉和华盛顿活动。李承晚本人于本月十九日赴日拜见他的主子麦克阿瑟，回到汉城后宣称：“韩国外长所宣布的拟参加盛传之亚洲反共集团的意向，系韩国最适当的外交政策”。
    美中日韩反动派的这种阴谋活动，正反映着它们对东方人民民主革命运动的恐惧和它们本身的脆弱。国民党反动政权在人民解放军的锤击之下，已摇摇欲坠。南韩傀儡政权在人民鄙弃之下，已面临着人民武装起义的严重危机。日本反动政府在民主力量不断揭露与工潮的冲击面前，正手忙脚乱。它们的自顾不暇，它们统治的不稳，在在证明了三年来美帝国主义在这些国家的政策已完全破产。至于在菲律宾、越南及其他东南亚殖民地半殖民地国土上，正普遍燃烧着人民武装反帝斗争的怒火，在那里的傀儡政权是同样脆弱的。因此，美帝国主义的远东警察同盟计划，较之泛美联盟与西欧联盟，更缺乏基础。
