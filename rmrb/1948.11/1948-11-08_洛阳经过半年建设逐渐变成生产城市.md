Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 4th. Luoyang, a famous city in the Central Plains, has seen significant development in production and construction in the half-year since its liberation. According to an August survey, there are 2,775 industrial and commercial households in the city, including 1,005 engaged in industries such as machinery, ironwork, casting, flour, matches, textiles, bamboo, and wood. During the Kuomintang's rule, the city's industry and commerce had 1,900 households last spring, but by the end of last year, only 514 remained, of which purely consumer-oriented businesses such as hotels, restaurants, and photography accounted for 26.6 percent. Since the city's liberation, all industries beneficial to the people's livelihood have developed. The manufacturing of textile machines has increased by 11, dyeing workshops have increased by 7.5 times, the cloth industry has increased by 2.5 times, and the cotton and salt industry has increased by almost 2 times. The purely consumer-oriented brewing industry has decreased by 7 households, and hotels have decreased by 13 households. In addition, the commercial firms and cooperatives under the leadership of the city's democratic government have resolved the livelihood difficulties of 70 percent of the poor by organizing family handicraft and small-scale industries and promoting the sale of their finished products. For example, as of early October, 1,000 housewives had received shoe-making work from the public commercial firm.

　　洛阳经过半年建设逐渐变成生产城市
    【新华社中原四日电】中原名城洛阳市解放后半年来，生产建设有显著发展。全市工商户据八月份调查有二千七百七十五家，内有一千零五家为机器、铁工、翻砂、面粉、火柴纺织、竹木等工业。该市工商业在国民党统治时期，去年春天尚有一千九百家，至去年底即只剩五百十四家，其中纯属消费业的旅社、饭馆、照像等即占了百分之二十六点六。该市解放后，凡有利于国民生计的行业均有发展，纺织机制造业增加十一家，染坊增加七倍半，布业增加了二倍半，棉盐业增加了几乎二倍。纯属消费的酿酒业则减少七户，旅栈减少十三户。此外，该市民主政府领导下的商行与合作社，又以组织家庭手工业与小型工业、并推销其成品的方法，解决了百分之七十的贫民的生活困难。如做鞋一项，十月初到公营商行领鞋做的家庭妇女即达千人。
