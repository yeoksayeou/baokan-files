Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. A dispatch from Electronegative Press, Bucharest, on the 19th: The journal "For Lasting Peace and People's Democracy" commented today that the liberation of Manchuria by the People's Liberation Army has caused a devastating defeat for the Chiang Kai-shek regime. This will prove to be of decisive significance for the victory of the democratic forces in China. The journal stated: "One thing is certain, neither the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek government and its numerous troops, nor the Marshall Plan in China, nor the American gold yuan and modern equipment, can prevent the victorious development of the people's liberation struggle. It is clear that it is not only the reactionary, traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique that has been defeated in China. American imperialism has also been defeated along with the Chiang Kai-shek army, which is appropriately called the army of the US State Department. Recent events in China prove that American gold yuan and guns are ineffective when faced with the will of a people bravely fighting for freedom, democracy and national independence."

　　情报局机关杂志评论：
  美蒋金元军队已被击败  人民解放胜利确定无疑
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】电通社布加勒斯特十九日讯：本日“争取持久和平与人民民主”杂志评称：由于满洲为人民解放军解放，蒋介石政权已遭受毁灭性失败。这将证明对于中国民主力量的胜利具有决定意义。该杂志谓：“有一件事是确定的，就是不论是反动的蒋介石政府及其众多的军队也好，不论是中国马歇尔计划也好，不论是美国金元和现代化装备也好，都不能阻止人民解放斗争的胜利发展。在中国被击败的不仅是反动的卖国的蒋介石集团，这是很清楚的。美国帝国主义也和被恰当地称为美国务院军队的蒋介石军队一齐被击败了。中国最近的事件证明：美国的金元与枪炮在遇到为争取自由、民主与国家独立而英勇奋战的人民之意志时，就毫无效力。”
