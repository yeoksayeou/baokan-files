　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 7th. Encouraged by the continuous victories on the Northeast front, the liberated peasants in various regions are working day and night to thresh grain in earnest, eagerly paying public grain ahead of schedule. In Shuangliao County, Liaobei Province (newly established county, merged from Shuangshan and Liaoyuan), the masses in Zhangjia, Yanling, and other six villages along the Si (Ping) Tao (Nan) road, to avoid harassment by Chiang's planes, divided the work during the day to thresh grain and collectively transported it by village at night. In just three and a half days, they paid more than 600,000 jin of public grain, accounting for two-thirds of the total autumn grain collection task. In order to facilitate the transportation of public grain, Chengguan, Yanling, and other districts of the county mobilized 2,000 laborers to rush to repair the road, completing 60 li of highway in two days. The boatmen at the Liaohe ferry, in order to transport public grain to the front as soon as possible, ferried day and night without rest. In Fushun County, Liaoning Province, most of the vehicles and livestock of the masses in the former border areas were taken away by the Kuomintang bandit troops. The masses organized manpower to pull small carts to deliver public grain. Those who did not have carts carried it on their backs, regardless of men and women, rushing to deliver it day and night, completing the task of collecting 200,000 jin of public grain in three days. In Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province, people generally threshed grain by moonlight in order to deliver public grain early. Zhao Jialiang, a village cadre in Chengguan District, specially exchanged good corn to pay public grain because his own corn kernels were not large. The wheat collection task this year has also been completed ahead of schedule in various places. In Lanxi County, Heilongjiang Province, after the wheat collection was arranged in mid-October, the entire county completed the delivery of 1.8 million jin of public wheat in three days. In Huachuan County, Hejiang Province, 1.49 million jin of public wheat were also quickly put into storage. Ping'an and other villages in the Mongolian Li District of the county exceeded their tasks. In Bayan County, Songjiang Province, Xinglong District completed the task of purchasing 200,500 jin of wheat in eight days. The masses in Guxiang Village, a suburb of Harbin, have delivered more than 57,000 jin of wheat, all of which is good wheat that has been selected. Amidst the upsurge of farmers rushing to deliver public grain in various places, the workers of the Shuangliao County Grain Bureau Rice Mill also processed and milled rice, producing 160,000 jin of refined rice. In Shuangyang County, southeast of Changchun, 200,000 people were enthusiastically mobilized, dispatching more than 1,000 carts to transport grain and grass day and night, which were continuously transported to the front. In Chicheng County, Chahar East, men, women, and children threshed grain while pushing the mill, mobilizing more than 1,000 ox carts, hundreds of donkeys, and more than 2,000 laborers, rushing to transport it day and night. The public grain task originally scheduled to be completed in ten days was completed five days ahead of schedule, and more than 30,000 jin were additionally delivered.
