　　After Land Reform
  　Do Landlords and Rich Peasants Have Civil Rights? Reply to Cui Tianshen, Wu'xiang County Government:
    The purpose of land reform is to eliminate the feudal system of exploitation, so that the broad masses of peasants, especially poor and hired peasants, can obtain land, which is conducive to developing production and promoting social progress. The landlord class is to be eliminated as a class, while individual landlords are to be reformed so that they engage in labor production. After the feudal land property of landlords and rich peasants has been confiscated or distributed, they should still be left with the same share of land property as the peasants economically; politically, they should also be given civil rights, except for a few criminals who are deprived of civil rights according to law. Because only in this way can we stabilize and encourage their production and gradually transform them into laborers. This is only beneficial to developing social production and creating social wealth. When we announce these civil rights of landlords and rich peasants, we must conduct appropriate explanations among the masses so that the masses have a correct understanding of this issue.

　　土改完成后
  　地主富农有无公民权？答武乡县政府崔天申：
    土地改革的目的，是消灭封建剥削制度，使广大农民首先是贫雇农得到土地，以利于发展生产，推动社会前进。对地主作为阶级是加以消灭，对地主个人则予以改造，使其从事劳动生产。当地主富农的封建土地财产已经没收或分配之后，在经济上仍留给他们以与农民同样一份土地财产；在政治上，除少数犯罪分子依法判决褫夺公民权者外，也应给他们以公民权利。因为这样才能安定与鼓励他们生产，使其逐渐改造为劳动者。这对发展社会生产，创造社会财富，只有好处。在我们宣布地主富农这种公民权利时，必须在群众中进行适当的解释，使群众对这一问题有正确的认识。　　　　　　——编者
