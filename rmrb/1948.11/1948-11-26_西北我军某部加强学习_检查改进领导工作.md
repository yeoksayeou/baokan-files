Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 18th: A certain brigade of the Northwest Field Army, in studying the "Decision on Leadership Methods" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in June 1943, reviewed its leadership work in light of reality and found that leaders at all levels of the brigade had many errors and shortcomings in general leadership methods, that is, in the key issue of "uniting active elements, raising intermediate elements, and winning over backward elements." After research, the brigade party committee called on the entire brigade to work together to effectively improve leadership style. The brigade's investigation into the main errors in the cultivation and use of active elements revealed a failure to promote work with typical examples, or a failure to educate and improve existing typical examples. For example, a certain company in a certain regiment had no desertions or dropouts for several months, and was good in terms of friendship, mutual assistance, and combat, but the leadership did not use this company as a typical example to educate the entire unit. Furthermore, many model units collapsed because they were only unilaterally praised without appropriate criticism and education. When praising heroes and models, their advantages were often exaggerated one-sidedly, and shortcomings were not pointed out. When the masses pointed them out, it was considered nitpicking, causing heroes and models to neglect overcoming shortcomings and become complacent. For example, a special-class hero of a certain regiment was originally very modest, but gradually became arrogant after becoming a hero. Cadres were embarrassed to make serious criticisms because he was a meritorious official, failing to understand that the more heroic someone is, the more serious one must be, and the more one must encourage self-criticism, because the masses pay special attention to him. For example, the cook hero, Di Lai, hit someone, and the masses said: "A meritorious official is still hitting people? Don't give him credit." After he reflected on himself, the masses said again: "His essence is still consistently good." He was still given credit. This proves that only in this way can heroes and models make further progress and avoid becoming detached from the masses. Another example is a transportation captain, who was a meritorious official. He only knew how to play a model role personally, constantly transporting goods all day long, and became very thin from exhaustion. The leading cadres only praised him, and then ignored him, without helping him with work methods. Many meritorious officials have been exhausted in this way.

On the issue of uniting and raising intermediate elements, the main error was that the subjective standards were set too high, requiring 100% completion to be considered good, and criticizing even slight deviations. Therefore, very few people met the conditions, let alone encouraging intermediate elements to continue to move forward. In a certain regiment's training, small group tactics were promoted, but the conclusion of one company was that "there were no good small groups because standards such as 'six fasts' and 'four goods' were stipulated, and anything that did not meet the subjective regulations was deemed unacceptable. A soldier had diarrhea during a march, and in order to meet the standard of not falling behind, he tried hard to catch up with the team after each bout of diarrhea, but it was still said that he was dropping out when he stopped to have diarrhea. This wrongly attacked many outstanding elements."

The errors were even more serious in dealing with backward elements. Instead of educating and transforming them, they were attacked and excluded. If the conversation was not agreeable, or if a few strange remarks were made that hurt the "face" of the leadership, people were often suspicious, suspecting that backward elements had political problems, and even treating them as non-comrades. This made backward elements pessimistic and disappointed. Some leading cadres looked at people with prejudice, without studying why they were backward, without reflecting on whether there were any errors in the leadership, and without solving problems in a timely manner. Now, no matter who it is in the company, they don't want to be seen as a backward element. It can be seen that everyone thinks it is shameful to be backward, and backward elements are also willing to make progress.

To this end, the brigade party committee called on leaders at all levels to use their brains more, strengthen learning, and promote democracy in the troops to give play to the enthusiasm of the masses, so that the internal life of the troops is united and lively. The typical models recognized by the masses in various movements must be constantly helped and constantly educated. Every small matter among the masses, even a single sentence, should be carefully considered. Give full play to high sensitivity and timely understand the emotions and demands of the masses. Small problems must be dealt with in a timely manner, and not wait until a total outbreak causes significant losses to the Party and the people before resolving them. It is also stipulated that leading cadres at all levels should use their time to convene small-scale forums to study leadership methods. Regimental cadres must repeatedly study the Central Committee's decision on leadership methods, write reflection notes, and make merciless exposures of past shortcomings and errors in order to improve leadership work. ＊

### 西北我军某部加强学习　检查改进领导工作

　　西北我军某部加强学习
  　检查改进领导工作
    【新华社西北十八日电】西北野战军某旅在学习中共中央一九四三年六月“关于领导方法的决定”一文件中，联系实际检查领导工作，发现该旅各级领导在一般领导方法上，即在“团结积极分子、提高中间分子、争取落后分子”的关键问题上，存在不少错误与缺点。该旅党委经研究后，特号召全旅一致努力，切实改进领导作风。该旅检查在积极分子的培养与使用问题上的主要错误，是不会以典型去推动工作，或者是对已有的典型不加以教育提高。如某团一个班，好几个月以来没有逃亡掉队现象，友爱、互助、作战各方面都好，但领导方面没有以这个班作典型去教育全体。而对许多模范单位只作片面表扬，不作适当批评教育的结果，很多都垮了台。对英雄模范表扬时，往往是片面夸大其优点，对缺点不予指出，群众指出时还认为是吹毛求疵，致使英雄模范也忽视克服缺点，流于骄傲自满。如某团特等英雄原很虚心，当了英雄慢慢骄傲起来。干部因为他是功臣，不好意思去作严肃的批评。不懂得越是英雄越要严肃，越要启发其自我批评，因为群众格外注意他。如炊事员英雄棣来小打了人，群众说：功臣还打人？不给他记功。当他作了反省后，群众又说：他本质上还是一贯好的。还是给他记了功。证明只有这样，英雄模范才能更加进步，才不致于脱离群众。又如一个运输队长，是个功臣，他只知个人起模范作用，一天不断的运，已经累瘦了。领导干部却只去表扬，表扬后就不管，而不在工作方法上去帮助他。这样累垮的功臣也不少。
    在团结与提高中间分子问题上，主要错误是主观订的标准过高，要百分之百完成才算好，一点不合就批评。因此很少合乎条件的。更谈不到鼓励中间分子继续前进。某团练兵中提倡小组战术，一个连的结论却是“没有一个好小组，原因就是规定了‘六快’，‘四好’等标准，一点不合乎主观规定就不行。一个战士在行军时泻肚，为了适合不掉队的标准，每次泻后都硬赶上队伍走，但还说人家停下泻肚时就是掉队。这样冤枉打击了许多优秀分子。”
    在对待落后分子问题上，错误更加严重。不是教育改造而是打击、排斥。碰到话不投机，或则是说了几句有伤领导上“面子”的怪话，动辄疑神疑鬼，怀疑落后分子政治上有问题，甚至不当同志看待。这样使落后分子悲观失望。部分领导干部以成见看人，不研究其为什么落后，不反省领导上有无错误，不及时解决问题。现在连队上不管什么人，最不愿意人家把他看成落后分子。可见大家认为落后可耻，落后分子也是愿意进步的。
    为此，该旅党委号召：各级领导干部必须多用脑筋，加强学习，发扬部队中的民主来发挥群众积极性，使部队内部生活团结活泼。对各种运动中产生的群众公认的典型模范，要不断帮助，不断教育。处理群众中的一件小事，哪怕是一句话都应详加考虑。发挥高度的敏感性，及时了解群众的情绪和要求。小问题要及时处理，不要等总爆发时对党对人民造成重大损失时才来解决。并规定各级领导干部要利用时间，召集小型座谈会研究领导方法，团的干部必须反复研讨中央的领导方法决定，写反省笔记，对过去的缺点错误作无情的揭发，以改进领导工作。＊
