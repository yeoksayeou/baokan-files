　　To Jing Bei Lie, Mu Shen Xiu, and Zeng Jun:
    Your suggestion to restore blackboard newspaper materials to the newspaper header is excellent. We have already started implementing it.

    To Zirong from the Fourth District of Jingxing:
    Being an elementary school teacher should be considered a major form of labor. You can request the work team and district committee to re-examine your class status according to the class division standards.

    To Zhongzheng Village, Ping District:
    It is inappropriate for the hospital to occupy the school, preventing it from opening. The district government can negotiate with them to relocate, so that the school can open as soon as possible.

    To Tian Xinmin, Reception Center of the First Corps of North China:
    After land is equally distributed and land rights are determined, it can be freely bought and sold.

    To Lu Ming from North China × Industrial School:
    Your request to get back your leather overcoat is a private dispute between cadres, which you can resolve yourself by writing a letter or going to negotiate.

    To Cui Mao from the Ninth District of Pingshan:
    Your family was wrongly struggled against during the land reform, and you have now been reclassified as a new middle peasant, but the land is not enough to maintain your livelihood. If your land confiscated in the village has not yet been distributed, it can be returned. If it has been distributed, you can draw compensation in the Pudong land reform work. Your harvested crops can be appropriately compensated.

    To Comrade Minqiang from Ping County:
    If you and your wife are emotionally incompatible, and the woman is mentally and physically normal, you can apply to the local government to go through the divorce procedures.

    To the Third District Committee of Xingbu:
    Those who desert from the army and return, working as cooks in the government or participating in factories, should no longer enjoy the treatment of military dependents.

    To Shen Yunfu from Huaxiang:
    The Security Council is the abbreviation of the United Nations Security Council.

    To Zhang Xiuyan from North China × Corps:
    Regarding your uncle Zhang Qingqi's case, who was detained by the Wu'yi Public Security Bureau on suspicion of collaborating with the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War, which has not been processed for several years, we have informed the Wu'yi Public Security Bureau to promptly investigate, interrogate, and adjudicate according to the law.

    To He Yingjie from the Taigu Office:
    Regarding whether revolutionary family members should have others cultivate their land on their behalf, it should be determined by whether there is surplus labor in the family. Please refer to Issue 144 of this newspaper.

    To Fu Denglong from the Diagnosis and Treatment Clinic of the Lushe Railway Bureau:
    Regarding the property confiscated from you during the land reform in your village, the district instructed the village cadres to return it, but the village cadres did not comply. You can still ask the district to help resolve it. We have forwarded your letter to the Xingtai First District Government.

    To Ah Huang, Zhang Yutian:
    In the class division standards, the phrase "when the democratic government was established" refers to county-level governments.
