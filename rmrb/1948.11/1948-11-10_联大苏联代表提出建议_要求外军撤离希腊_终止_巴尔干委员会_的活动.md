Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: TASS, Paris: The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began discussing the Greek issue on October 25th. The discussion process revealed that the US-British bloc was attempting to use the UN General Assembly platform to clamor about the so-called threat posed by Greece's northern neighbors to Greek independence, in order to justify their already failed adventure in Greece. They used their controlled majority vote to reject the reasonable proposals made by the Soviet Union to invite representatives from Bulgaria and Albania to participate in the discussion, as well as the proposal made by Yugoslavia to invite representatives from the Greek democratic government. US Representative Dulles, in his speech on the 26th, groundlessly accused Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia of "interfering in Greek internal affairs," and suggested that the so-called "Balkan Committee," illegally established in the previous session of the United Nations General Assembly, should continue its activities. The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, in a lengthy speech on the 28th, enumerated the crimes of US-British interference in Greece and denounced the report of the so-called "Balkan Committee" as a pile of garbage that should be discarded. On October 29th, the Soviet delegation submitted a proposal on the Greek issue to the committee for discussion. The proposal pointed out that the characteristic of the Greek situation in the past year has been the further intensification of the struggle between the Greek people and the anti-democratic forces represented by the current Athens government. The intensified foreign interference has brought serious consequences to Greece. The proposal demands that all foreign troops withdraw from Greece and that the activities of the "Balkan Committee" established by the previous UN General Assembly be terminated.

　　联大苏联代表提出建议
    要求外军撤离希腊
  　终止“巴尔干委员会”的活动
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：联大政治安全委员会于十月二十五日起讨论希腊问题。讨论过程表明：美英集团力图利用联大讲坛，叫嚣所谓希腊北邻对希腊独立的威胁，以便为其在希腊已经失败了的冒险进行辩护。它们利用其控制的多数投票，否决了苏联所提邀请保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚的代表及南斯拉夫所提邀请希腊民主政府的代表参加讨论的合理建议。美代表杜勒斯二十六日在发言中毫无根据地谴责阿、保、南三国“干涉希腊内政”，并建议在上届联合国大会中非法建立的所谓“巴尔干委员会”，应继续活动。苏代表团团长维辛斯基二十八日在长篇演说中，历数美英干涉希腊的罪行，并痛斥所谓“巴尔干委员会”的报告为一堆垃圾，应予扔弃。十月二十九日，苏联代表团又以关于希腊问题的议案提交委员会讨论。议案指出：过去一年来，希腊形势的特点，是希腊人民与现在雅典政府所代表的反民主力量之间的斗争进一步的加剧。外国的加紧干涉，给希腊带来了严重的后果。该议案要求一切外国军队撤离希腊，并终止上届联大所成立的“巴尔干委员会”的活动。
