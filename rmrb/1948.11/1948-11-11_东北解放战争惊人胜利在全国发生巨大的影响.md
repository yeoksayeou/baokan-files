　　The Astonishing Victory of the Northeast Liberation War Has a Huge Impact Nationwide

    In the first week of November, the Chinese people won one of the greatest victories in the Liberation War, liberating Shenyang and thus completing the liberation of the entire Northeast. This victory, combined with the three victories in Jinzhou, Changchun, and western Liaoning on the Northeast battlefield in a month, and the victories on various battlefields within the Shanhaiguan Pass, greatly changed the national military situation. According to preliminary statistics, the People's Liberation Army has eliminated more than 600,000 enemies in the autumn offensive that began in mid-September.

    Shenyang was liberated on the 2nd of this month. The defending enemies in Shenyang, except for a few people such as Wei Lihuang and Du Yuming who escaped by plane in advance, were all wiped out, including six infantry divisions, three cavalry brigades, and many special forces and miscellaneous troops. The People's Liberation Army obtained extremely large amounts of supplies in Shenyang. Yingkou was also recovered on the same day as the liberation of Shenyang. The Kuomintang’s approximately 200,000 troops annihilated in western Liaoning and Shenyang had all planned to withdraw from Yingkou, but the rapid offensive of the People's Liberation Army disrupted their plan. Only the 52nd Army, originally in Liaoyang, occupied Yingkou, but one division of this army and one regiment of another division were also annihilated when the People's Liberation Army recovered Yingkou. Only two regiments and the army headquarters escaped by sea, and more than 3,000 were killed. This is what the Kuomintang propaganda machine calls the "arduous and magnificent feat of retreating before the enemy" by the large army in western Liaoning and Shenyang.

    The astonishing victory of the Northeast Liberation War immediately had an unprecedented and torrential impact across the country. All major cities north of the Yangtze River ruled by the Kuomintang were without exception plunged into panic. The US Embassy not only notified expatriates in Beiping and Tianjin, but also notified expatriates in Shanghai and Nanjing to evacuate as soon as possible. The military fate of the Kuomintang, whether in North China or East China, was widely believed to soon become a second Northeast. Under the victorious offensive of the People's Liberation Army, the Kuomintang army is continuing to flee from many important cities. In the past week, the Kuomintang fled from Nanyang, an important town in southwestern Henan, and Shangshan in eastern Henan. Huojia in northern Henan was liberated, and more than 3,000 defending enemies were annihilated. Henan Province is closer to complete liberation. In Hebei, Fu Zuoyi's so-called "powerful aid-to-Shanxi army group" attempting to attack Shijiazhuang by surprise suffered a blow in the Ding County area and has fled back north of Baoding.

    Kuomintang's Economy Suffers a Miserable Defeat, "Currency Reform" and "Price Controls" Collapse Across the Board

    The Kuomintang reactionaries not only suffered a military defeat, but also suffered an economic defeat, which made the past week's rule of the Kuomintang particularly dark. On the 31st of last month, the puppet Executive Yuan was forced to announce that it would abandon the price control policy starting from the 1st of this month. This means that the policy of "currency reform" and "price controls," which was touted by the Sino-US reactionaries as a miraculous medicine for revival, implemented by the Kuomintang reactionaries with a strength second only to military force, and enforced by Jiang Jieshi's eldest son Jiang Jingguo as the commander with special powers and armed compulsion, only lasted for 43 days before collapsing across the board. What followed was an even larger wave of inflation, soaring prices, and material shortages. According to a Reuters dispatch from Shanghai on the 2nd, various prices have risen five to fifteen times compared to when price controls were abolished.

    The Kuomintang Military and Economic Crisis Directly Forms a Political Crisis

    The first political reaction to the collapse of the "Gold Yuan" was the resignation of the Kuomintang government's Weng Wenhao "cabinet." The Kuomintang government's military crisis and economic crisis have directly formed a political crisis. The disintegration within the Kuomintang has reached such a degree that many factions are now openly demanding that Jiang Jieshi step down and go abroad. These factions belong to the Kuomintang reactionaries together with Jiang Jieshi's direct descendants and are equally executing the orders of their American masters. But their American masters did not give them any comfort. The chaos within the Kuomintang reflects the chaos of the American imperialists themselves. All the reactionary factions of the Kuomintang have been paying close attention to the US presidential election in the past week. The US Republican Party has been openly regarded by them as a better "savior" than the Democratic Party. The failure of the Republican campaign added another layer of darkness to the dark picture of the Nanjing government.

    Good News from the People's Liberation Army Continues to Pour In, Liberation Areas Universally Report Good Harvests

    While continuously celebrating military victories, the liberation areas have continuously reported good harvests. The Northeast Liberation Area has an 80% harvest this year, the North China Liberation Area averages 70%, most areas of Shandong average 60% to 70%, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia averages 80%, and Jin-Sui has a harvest unseen in ten years.

### 东北解放战争惊人胜利在全国发生巨大的影响

　　东北解放战争惊人胜利在全国发生巨大的影响
    在十一月的第一周中，中国人民赢得了解放战争中最大胜利之一，解放沈阳，从而完成了全东北的解放。这个胜利，连同东北战场上一个月在锦州、长春、辽西的三次胜利，和关内各战场的胜利，大大改变了全国军事形势。据初步统计，人民解放军在九月中旬开始的秋季攻势中，已经消灭敌人六十余万。
    沈阳是在本月二日解放，沈阳的守敌除卫立煌、杜聿明等少数人员事先乘飞机逃脱外，全部被消灭，其中包含六个步兵师，三个骑兵旅和很多特种兵部队和杂色部队。解放军在沈阳得到了极大的缴获。在沈阳解放的同一天营口也被收复。国民党在辽西和沈阳被歼的共约二十万大军都曾经计划从营口撤退，但是解放军的迅速进攻破坏了他们的计划。只有一个原在辽阳的五十二军占领了营口，但是这个军的一个师和另一个师的一个团也在解放军收复营口时被歼，只有两个团和军部从海上逃跑，并被击毙三千多。这就是国民党宣传机关所谓辽西沈阳大军的“艰苦壮观的敌前撤退伟绩”。
    东北解放战争的惊人胜利立即在全国发生了前所未见的狂风暴雨式的影响。国民党所统治的长江以北的各大城市无例外地陷于恐慌之中。美国大使馆不但通知了北平天津的侨民，而且通知了上海南京的侨民，尽速撤退。国民党无论在华北或华东的军事命运，被普遍地认为很快就要变成东北第二。在解放军的胜利攻势下，国民党军队正在继续从许多重要城市逃跑。在过去一周中，国民党逃出了豫西南重镇南阳和豫东的商山。豫北的获嘉被解放，守敌三千余人被歼。河南省已更加接近于全部解放。在河北，傅作义的企图偷袭石家庄的所谓“强大援晋兵团”在定县地区遭受打击以后，已经逃回保定以北。
    国民党经济上亦遭惨败“币改”“限价”全线崩溃
    国民党反动派不但遭受了军事上的惨败，而且遭受了经济上的惨败，这使得过去一周中国民党整个统治特别黑暗。上月三十一日伪行政院已被迫宣布于本月一日起放弃限价政策。这就是说：这个被中美反动派所吹嘘为起死回生妙药的、由国民党反动派以仅次于军事力量去实施、并在蒋介石的大儿子蒋经国为主将凭特殊权力武装强迫实行的所谓“货币改革”与“限制物价”的政策，仅仅支持了四十三天就全线崩溃了。接着而来的是更大规模的通货膨胀与物价高涨、物资缺乏的狂潮。据路透社二日上海电，各种物价较废除限价时已涨达五倍到十五倍。
    国民党军事经济危机直接形成政治危机
    “金圆券”崩溃的第一个政治反应就是国民党政府的翁文灏“内阁”总辞职。国民党政府的军事危机和经济危机已经直接形成政治危机。国民党内部的分崩离析达到这种程度，以至很多派别现在公开要求蒋介石下野和出国。这些派别与蒋介石嫡系同属于国民党反动派，并且同样是执行着他们的美国主人的命令。但是他们的美国主人并没有给他们什么安慰。国民党内部的混乱反映着美国帝国主义者自己的混乱。国民党各个反动派别在过去一星期中都曾经紧张地注意美国的总统选举。美国共和党曾经被他们公开地看做是一个比民主党更好的“救星”。共和党竞选失败，在南京政府的黑暗画面上又加重了一层黑暗。
    解放军捷报频传解放区普告丰收
    解放区于不断庆祝军事胜利的同时，各地不断报告丰收。东北解放区今年有八成年景，华北解放区平均七成，山东大部分地区平均为六、七成，陕甘宁平均八成，晋绥则为十年以来未有之丰收。【新华社】
