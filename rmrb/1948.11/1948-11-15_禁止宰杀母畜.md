　　Prohibition of Slaughtering Female Livestock
    The democratic government has repeatedly announced the prohibition of slaughtering draught animals, especially cows, donkeys, sheep, etc. However, recently in various towns, shops, markets, and during the commodity fairs and mule and horse fairs, many people engaged in the slaughtering business have casually bought some young cows, sheep, etc., for indiscriminate slaughter.
    Now, our North China Liberated Area, while continuing to support the Liberation War, is vigorously restoring and developing agricultural production and construction, which requires a large number of livestock. Therefore, the government should once again call for the protection of livestock, reward the breeding of livestock, and resolutely and effectively prohibit the slaughter of working draught animals, cows, donkeys, sheep, etc., encouraging the masses to buy female livestock in groups and breed them in large numbers to support the war and solve the problem of livestock shortages in production. Otherwise, allowing indiscriminate slaughter will be a great loss to both the war effort and production. (Hu Daxian, Qinyuan)

　　禁止宰杀母畜
    民主政府曾屡次宣布禁止宰杀耕畜，尤其是母牛、母驴、母羊等。但近来各地镇店集市，以及百货大会、骡马大会期间，许多经营宰杀业的人，又随便把一些口轻的母牛、母羊等买来乱杀。
    现在我华北解放区，一面继续支援解放战争，一面正在大力恢复与发展农业生产建设，这就需要大批的畜力。因此，政府应再次号召保护牲畜，奖励繁殖牲畜，并坚决地有效地来禁止宰杀有劳力的耕畜与母牛、母驴、母羊等，让群众伙买母畜，大量繁殖，来支援战争与解决生产中的畜力困难。否则，任其乱宰、乱杀，对战争与生产，都是一个极大的损失。（沁源胡大贤）
