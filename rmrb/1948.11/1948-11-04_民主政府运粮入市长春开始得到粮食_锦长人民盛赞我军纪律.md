Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, November 2nd: Starving Changchun has now begun to receive grain. The 700,000 people of Changchun, who were brutally exploited by the Kuomintang for two years and five months and were on the verge of death, are now receiving enthusiastic relief from the democratic government. The Northeast Democratic Government's six million jin of grain, prepared long ago for the people of Changchun, is being transported into the city via the newly repaired railway. Relief grain distribution began on the third day after the liberation of Changchun (October 21st). Other necessities such as coal, oil, salt, vegetables, and cash will also be distributed in the coming days. The scope of this relief effort is extremely broad, including revolutionary military families, workers, the poor, merchants, employees of various government agencies, teachers and staff of schools, students, and various charitable organizations. According to incomplete statistics, during the Kuomintang's 29 months of dark rule in Changchun, over 12,000 people died of starvation or were shot, and those waiting for food relief account for about 60% of the city's population. The city is now divided into seven relief zones. In addition to dispatching more than 30 working team members to each zone, who are specifically responsible for registering and distributing relief grain and investigating and handling disaster situations, the government has also extensively organized merchants to establish relief agencies under the supervision and guidance of the working teams to be responsible for distribution and transportation, and will provide a certain amount of remuneration afterward, in order to rapidly carry out the relief work. After receiving the relief grain, the people of Changchun praised the democratic government and the People's Liberation Army as their "lifesaving benefactors" and sent representatives to express their gratitude. They deeply hated the Kuomintang's atrocities of creating famine and shooting people, and expressed their determination to demand blood debts from Chiang Kai-shek and avenge their parents, brothers, and sisters who died.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, November 2nd: The strict urban discipline of the Northeast People's Liberation Army has been praised by the masses in both Changchun and Jinzhou. In Changchun, the garrison troops prohibit anyone without a pass or transport permit from the Military Control Commission from passing through or transporting goods. Soldiers of the Ninth Company of the Third Regiment, guarding a clothing warehouse, would rather endure the cold while on night sentry duty than use a single item. A soldier of the Second Company of the First Battalion broke a vase in a household and immediately compensated them with 2,000 yuan. The compensated person said with great gratitude: "If it were the Kuomintang army, they would scold you for the vase not being strong enough, and that would be the best you could hope for!" Each regiment of the People's Liberation Army entering the city has organized a discipline inspection team to inspect the discipline of the troops daily. Each squad also holds a review meeting in the evening to supervise and encourage each other, ensuring that they do not take a single needle or thread from the masses and that all captured materials are turned over to the public. This is because sufficient urban policy education was conducted before entering the city, and everyone automatically reviewed their "small plans," wrote a letter of determination to abide by urban discipline, challenged each other, and guaranteed each other. When liberating Jinzhou, our attacking troops also spent two days conducting urban entry education before the general offensive, and called on every commander and fighter to do mass work. At the same time, a group of office cadres were also transferred to organize working teams, led by the department and the directors of various political departments, to maintain order in the city. During the fierce battle after entering the city, the attacking troops still encouraged themselves with the "Eight Entry Rules." When a civilian house in the city was set on fire by shelling, the Fourth Company of a certain regiment bravely went to put out the fire, regardless of the enemy's fierce artillery fire. The company also protected a private hospital, so that it did not suffer any losses. The hospital owner said with emotion: "This unit is really good. If the 'Central Army' had come, my hospital would have been finished long ago!" As soon as the battle ended, the soldiers immediately stood guard and helped the citizens repair the houses destroyed by the enemy. Things borrowed to build fortifications were returned to their original owners. Some squads and platoons also held discussions with citizens, widely publicizing our army's policies. Under the influence of this good urban discipline of the unit, citizens came forward to report the materials buried by the enemy.

    民主政府运粮入市长春开始得到粮食
    锦长人民盛赞我军纪律
    【新华社长春二日电】饥饿的长春，现在开始得到了粮食，被国民党两年零五个月残暴压榨得奄奄一息的七十万长春人民，正受到民主政府热情的救济。东北民主政府早为长春人民准备好的六百万斤粮食，正经由刚抢修好的铁路运入市区。自解放长春的第三日（十月二十一日）起救济粮即开始发放；其他生活必需品煤、油、盐、菜、现款等，日内也将开始分发。此次救济范围极广，包括革命军属、工人、贫民、商人、各机关之职工、学校之教职员、学生及各慈善团体等。据不完全统计，长市人民在国民党二十九个月的黑暗统治下，因饥饿致死或遭枪杀者达一万二千余人，立待食粮救济者竟占全市人口百分之六十左右。全市现分七个救济区。政府除在每区派有工作队员三十余人，专门负责登记、分发救济粮及对灾情之调查、处理外，为迅速开展救济工作起见，并广泛组织商民成立救济代办所，在工作队监督指导下，负责分配及运输，事后给予一定报酬。长市人民在得到救济粮后，齐声称颂民主政府及人民解放军为“救命恩人”，并纷纷推派代表前往致谢。他们对国民党制造饥饿及枪杀人民等暴行，均切齿痛恨，纷纷表示要向蒋介石讨还血债，为死难的父母兄弟姊妹复仇。
    【新华社东北二日电】东北解放军的城市纪律严明，在长春与锦州都得到群众的称赞。在长春，卫戍部队禁止没有军事管制委员会的通行证及搬运证者通行或搬运物资。三团九连战士看守被服仓库，夜晚放哨，宁肯忍着寒冷也不动用一件。一营二连某战士打破了某户一个花瓶，当场赔了二千元，受赔偿者非常感激地说：“要是国民党军打了，不骂你花瓶不结实就是好的了。”入城解放军每团均组织纪律检查组，每日检查部队纪律。每个班并于晚上举行检讨会，互相督促勉励，做到不动群众一针一线，缴获物资全部归公。这是由于入城前充分进行了城市政策教育，每人都自动检讨了自己的“小打算”，写了遵守城市纪律的决心书，互相挑战，互相保证。解放锦州时，我攻城部队亦于总攻前以两天时间进行入城教育，并号召每个指战员都做群众工作，同时还抽调一部分机关干部组织工作队，由该部及各政治部主任领导下，维持城内秩序。攻城部队在入城后的激烈战斗中仍时以“八项入城守则”自勉。市内一家民房被炮击着火，某团四连不顾敌人炮火的猛击，勇敢地前往救火。该连并保护了一家私人医院，使之未受丝毫捐失。医院主人感动地说：“这个部队真好，要是‘中央军’来时，我这个医院早完啦！”战斗刚结束，战士们即一面放哨，一面帮助市民修理被敌人摧毁的房舍。借来修筑工事的东西，均送还原主。有些班排还召集市民座谈，广泛宣传我军政策。在该部这种良好的城市纪律影响下，市民纷纷出面告发敌人所埋藏的物资。
