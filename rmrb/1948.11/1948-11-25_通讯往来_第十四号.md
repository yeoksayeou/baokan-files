To all Regional Party Committees, County and City Party Committees, Offices, and Comrade Correspondents:

According to submissions from various regions, some areas are nearing completion of the second phase of land reform in villages and the preliminary Party consolidation work. However, reports on this are still scarce. We urge everyone to promptly report on the progress, issues encountered, and lessons learned from the previous stage of work, either comprehensively or with specific reports on typical villages. How is winter production work being integrated with other tasks? What achievements have been made in developing handicrafts and sideline occupations among the masses, and in preparing for next year's production? What problems still exist? What is the production enthusiasm of the masses after the land reform? We hope to receive reports on all these matters promptly.

To the comrades of the Jinnan Third Regional Party Committee Office:

We have received the five copies of materials and four articles you sent, and they are currently being studied and processed separately. We also hope to receive a comprehensive report on the progress of winter work in each county.

To the office of the Jinnan Fifth Special Administrative Office, and Comrade Zhao Qing of Zhengping:

We have received your October work report and study summary. We think it's excellent that you have established a working system of sending us comprehensive reports. We also hope you will send us a copy of the ten-day report you send to the Administrative Office.

To Comrade Ou Zheng of the Feixiang Third District, Jinnan:

After receiving the investigation on the rural branch situation, we have not received any further submissions. Please promptly write about the progress of each stage of your work after you understand the situation.
