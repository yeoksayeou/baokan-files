　　Why are the workers detaining people?
Editor:

　　I am Liu Wenxiu from Nanliugang Village, Second District, Wei County. My father's name is Liu Xiaozhang, and he is a carpenter. I have four brothers, and there are thirteen people in my family. I have been a poor peasant since I was a child. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, I went to Shanxi to suffer. I lived there for three years, but still could not make a living, so I returned home. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, my whole family fled to Tongliao County in Guandong, still relying on hard labor for food. In the twentieth year, when Japan attacked Guandong, my mother, my fourth brother, and I returned to our old home in Wei County. At that time, I left my father, second brother, and third brother behind. They returned in the twenty-eighth year. In the thirty-fourth year of the Republic of China, the Eighth Route Army liberated Wei County. At that time, I was farming for Liu Derong in my village. When rent reduction came, he would not give me grain, but gave me ten mu of land. Later, I was given another eight mu of land. Only then did I get a chance to turn over. In May of the thirty-sixth year, my father was doing carpentry work for someone in Beigao Town. The people in my village called him back and elected him as a representative of the poor peasants to lead the poor peasants to turn over. In October, during the conscription campaign, my father sent my fourth brother, Liu Guangyuan, to enlist. At that time, the Wei County government sent my family a letter of commendation, saying that my fourth brother, Liu Guangyuan, was a model soldier (now in the Dabie Mountains). This year in February, some workers came to work in my village. In August, the workers proposed electing cadres. At that time, the villagers voted, and my father, Liu Xiaoshun, and Liu Zhongshu received the most votes and were elected. At this time, the workers suddenly proposed, "The elected cadres are completely cancelled, temporarily appointed, and then elected later." At this time, my father said to the workers, "If you want to appoint, you shouldn't call it an election. If you want an election, you shouldn't appoint." At the same time, the masses said the same. The workers then said to my father, "You go back and have a meeting to see what to do!" So my father called a meeting of the new cadres that night. At this time, the workers said that my father was "holding a private meeting." The next day, he held a mass meeting and said that my father was "harboring landlords" and tied my father up with ropes and sent him to the Beigao Town government for detention. It has been almost two months now and it has not been resolved. I think I am a poor peasant, and my father is already over sixty years old. What crime has he committed that he has been tied up and detained? Now that it is cold and life at home is difficult, I request an investigation and release as soon as possible. This is my hope. What I said, please investigate in my village and neighboring villages. If there is anything untrue, I am willing to be punished.

　　魏县二区南刘岗
  　工作员为什么扣押人？编辑同志：
    我是魏县二区南刘岗村人，我叫刘文秀，我父亲叫刘孝章，是个木作工人，我兄弟四人，全家共有十三口。我从小就是个贫农，民国九年到山西受苦，在那里住了三年，生活仍然没有办法，遂又回家，到民国十三年，全家又逃荒到了关东通辽县，还是靠给人家受苦吃饭。到二十年日本进攻关东，我就和母亲、四弟等先回到老家魏县了，当时丢下我父亲、二弟、三弟，他们到二十八年也回来了，民国三十四年，八路军解放了魏县。那时我正给我村刘德容种地，减租时他不给粮食，给了我十亩地，后来又分了八亩地，这时我才得到了翻身。到三十六年五月，父亲在北皋镇给人家做木作活，我村群众叫他回来，把他选上了贫农代表，领导贫农翻身。到十月间，参军运动时我父亲又送我四弟刘光元报名参军，当时魏县县政府还给我家送过喜报，说我四弟刘光元是参军模范（现在大别山）。今年二月有工作员到我村工作。到八月时工作员提出民选干部，那时全村群众就进行了投票选举，选举结果我父亲和刘孝顺、刘忠恕得票最多，他三人被选上了。这时工作员忽又提出“民选的干部完全取消，暂时指定，以后再选。”这时我父亲就对工作员说：“既要指定就不该叫民选，既要民选就不该指定。”同时群众也是这样说。工作员又对我父亲说：“你们再去开会看怎好就怎办吧！”于是我父亲就在那天晚上召集新干部开会，这时工作员就说我父亲是“私自开会”，第二天他便召开群众大会说我父亲“包庇地主”就把我父亲用绳子捆绑送了北皋镇公所扣押。到现在将近两个月还没有解决。我想我是个贫农，我父亲已经是六十多岁的人了，到底犯了什么罪？竟被捆绑扣押？现在天冷了，家中生活困难，要求早早调查处理释放，这是我的希望。我说的这话，请到我村和邻村调查调查，如有不实，愿受处分。
