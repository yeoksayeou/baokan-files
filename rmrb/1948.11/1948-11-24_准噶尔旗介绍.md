Introduction to the Jungar Banner

The development of the Jungar Banner in the Yikezhao League of Suiyuan Province is one example of the liberation of the people of Western Mongolia under the leadership of the Communist Party. The banner is located in the eastern part of the Yikezhao League on the south bank of the Yellow River in Suiyuan Province. It is bordered by the Yellow River to the east, the Junwang Banner to the west, the Zhasake Banner to the southwest, the Dalate Banner to the north, and the Great Wall to the southeast, bordering Shenmu and Fugu in northern Shaanxi and Hequ in Shanxi. It stretches about 230 li from east to west and 270 li from north to south. The terrain is flat and there are many rivers. Mongolians and Han Chinese live together, with a population of about 100,000. Agriculture is well-developed, making it a relatively rich banner in the Yimeng region. Commerce is also relatively developed, with six towns including Nalin, Shaqitu, Nuanshui, Wuziwan, Shili Changtan, and Gucheng. However, due to the years of plunder and oppression by the bandit Fu Zuoyi, the Mongolian and Han people of the banner were inevitably plunged into extreme poverty. Last year's severe drought aggravated the people's suffering. In May of this year, the Yikezhao League detachment of the People's Liberation Army liberated the Jungar Banner, causing some dramatic changes in the banner's history. 100,000 Mongolian and Han people established a Mongolian-Han Temporary Autonomous Committee as the highest administrative organ of the banner. The first major task of the Autonomous Committee was to lead production and disaster relief. With the concerted efforts of the people and the government, they completely overcame the disaster. This was followed by an unprecedented bumper harvest this autumn. To protect the autumn harvest, the soldiers and civilians of the banner repelled more than 1,600 of Fu's bandit troops who came to loot grain. The people of the banner are now actively engaged in autumn plowing, repairing wells, and preparing for a major production increase next year. The banner now has ten districts and thirty-five townships, and publishes the only Mongolian newspaper in the Yikezhao League.

　　准噶尔旗介绍
    绥远伊克昭盟准噶尔旗的发展，是西蒙人民在共产党领导下获得解放的实例之一。该旗位于绥远省黄河南岸伊克昭盟东部，东临黄河，西邻郡王旗，西南接扎萨克旗，北邻达拉特旗，东南至长城与陕北之神木、府谷及山西之河曲接壤，东西宽约二百三十余里，南北长二百七十余里。地势平坦，河流较多。蒙汉杂居，人口约十万，农业发达，为伊盟中向称富饶的一旗。商业亦较发达，有纳林、沙圪堵、暖水、五子湾、十里长滩、古城等市镇六处。但由于傅匪作义的历年掠夺压榨，该旗蒙汉人民却不能不陷于极度的贫困。去年的严重旱灾加重了人民的苦难。今年五月，人民解放军的伊克昭盟支队解放了准噶尔旗，使该旗的历史发生了一些突变。十万蒙汉人民建立了蒙汉临时自治委员会，作为全旗的最高行政机关。自治委员会的第一件大事就是领导生产救灾。在人民和政府通力合作之下，完全渡过灾荒以后，接着来了今年秋季的多年未有的丰收。为了保卫秋收，该旗军民曾经击退傅匪军一千六百多人的抢粮。该旗人民现正积极进行秋翻地，修水井，准备明年的大生产。该旗现辖十个区三十五个乡，出版着伊克昭盟的唯一蒙古报纸。
