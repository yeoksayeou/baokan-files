Experiences and Lessons on Uniting and Consolidating New Soldiers
    Summary by the Political Department of a certain brigade of the North China Second Corps · Organized by Liú Xīng

    The relationship between officers and soldiers, and between soldiers themselves, in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is one of class comrades and revolutionary comrades. Due to the nature of the PLA and the broad understanding of this nature by its commanders and fighters, internal relations are united. From politics and economics to culture and even military affairs, there is full democratic life, and this democracy is for mutual enlightenment and improving awareness, strengthening friendship and unity, improving combat effectiveness, and concentrating will and power to eliminate the enemy. One of the reasons why the PLA is consolidated and invincible lies in its correct internal relations. Therefore, even when the army expands rapidly, new soldiers, under the leadership and help of officers and veteran soldiers, and through the warm education of the revolutionary big family, can quickly become veteran soldiers, enabling the army to withstand severe war tests. The experience of a certain brigade of the North China People's Liberation Army Field Army Second Corps in uniting and consolidating new soldiers is good. First, they correctly understood the internal relations of the PLA. Under the guidance of this correct ideology, they carried out a series of tasks, ensuring that none of the thirty-two companies deserted. They opposed both warlord-style methods of leading troops and blindly accommodating certain backward ideas of new soldiers, using unity and mutual assistance to achieve enlightenment and improve awareness. It must be pointed out that our army has not universally and thoroughly resolved this issue. Some units have even badly adopted methods of distrusting new soldiers and passively preventing them from deserting. This is an ideological behavior that betrays the class and violates the nature of the PLA, and must be corrected. The consolidation work of a certain brigade of the Second Corps is a powerful criticism of such ideological behavior.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Editor
    This time, we successively supplemented two batches of new soldiers from Jingxing and Hunyuan, totaling 792, and assigned them to 50 mess units. Starting from the Xiejiabao area, after the Shangxiadian battle, climbing mountains and wading through rivers, crossing the PingSui and PingGu railways, we arrived in eastern Hebei. There were 28 deserters in total, and none of the thirty-two companies had any deserters. During this period, we gained some experience in uniting and consolidating new soldiers, and also learned some very painful lessons. Based on the existing materials from various regiments, we put forward the following points for reference by the entire army.

    I. Unifying Thinking on Uniting and Consolidating New Soldiers

    (1) Combining Initial Welcome with Long-Term Care
    When new soldiers first arrive, most regiments do the following: line up to welcome them, buy meat and vegetables, improve food, buy some local products, tea, fruit, and cigarettes, boil water, and hold forums for mutual introductions. Veteran soldiers also give some daily necessities (towels, military uniforms) to new soldiers, showing the enthusiasm and concern of veteran comrades for new comrades. This has become a habit in our army. However, past shortcomings have been that the initial welcome was done well, but long-term care was lacking, which affected the consolidation and improvement of new soldiers. Therefore, this time, we particularly emphasized overcoming this point. After the new soldiers were incorporated into the units, they were still able to take care of and care for the new soldiers in all aspects. Mutual assistance in physical strength was common during marching. Many companies in the ×× regiment did not allow new comrades to stand guard during marches. In the 7th company, 8th squad of the regiment, every time they arrived at a campsite, they first let the new comrades wash their feet and rest, and the veteran soldiers rested later. They dug fortifications for the new comrades and assigned specific tasks to lead them during battles. Whenever they had free time, they taught the new soldiers how to practice bayonet fighting and shooting, proving that combining the initial welcome with long-term care can consolidate and improve them.

    (2) Combining Raising Class Consciousness with Improving Military Skills
    Rely on the existing awareness of the new soldiers who have turned over and obtained land, encourage them to protect their land and homes, and arouse their high revolutionary enthusiasm to defeat Chiang Kai-shek. For example, companies like the machine gun and artillery company of the first battalion of the ×× regiment focused on this education during forums after the new soldiers were incorporated. However, in the past, it was believed that consolidating new soldiers was mainly political work, and little attention was paid to improving the military skills of new soldiers (new soldiers attached great importance to this, feeling that they could not fight if they did not know how to shoot or throw grenades). This time, various units paid more attention than in the past. Comrade Liú Qìngsān, deputy battalion commander of the first battalion of the ×× regiment, based on the main psychology of new soldiers being afraid of fighting, flexibly adopted the method of explaining and gesturing at the same time, explaining the actions of new soldiers on the battlefield bit by bit, which was very practical, and the actual combat actions of the new soldiers achieved good results. With personal hard work and the active help of veteran comrades, Liú Tiělín, a new soldier of the 6th company of the ×× regiment, learned to disassemble and assemble a machine gun in a week. Veteran soldiers taught new soldiers how to shoot and bayonet whenever they had free time. Various regiments also generally allowed new soldiers to practice throwing grenades once, so that the new soldiers learned and dared to actually throw grenades. Therefore, in the Shangxiadian battle, some new soldiers ran out of their personal grenades. ××× of the 5th company of the ×× regiment and new soldiers of the ×× regiment charged with veteran soldiers even after suffering minor injuries. This is the result of attaching importance to improving the military skills of new soldiers.

    (3) Combining Mobilizing Veteran Soldiers to Help New Soldiers with Inspiring New Soldiers' Self-Awareness
    After the new soldiers arrived this time, the veteran soldiers were very enthusiastic, especially in taking care of them in their daily lives, taking out their own shirts, towels, and socks for the new comrades. In order to solve the difficulty of new comrades not having bowls for eating, the veteran soldiers in the machine gun and artillery company of the first battalion of the ×× regiment gave their personal small bowls to the new soldiers, and when new ones were issued, they took the new ones back and exchanged them for the old ones. The veteran soldiers of the third squad of the 5th company gave their personal small bowls to the new soldiers to use, and if they could not borrow any, they used small iron shovels and tiles to eat, which gave the new comrades a great sense of being moved. Some new soldiers said: "The comrades treat us so well, we have nothing else to offer but to learn from you." Liú Nián of the 5th company of the ×× regiment said: "I used to miss home, but the comrades treat me so well, I will work hard in the future and not miss home anymore."

    However, a small number of new soldiers were not self-aware despite the help of veteran soldiers. When veteran soldiers rushed to get food, they waited to eat; when veteran soldiers swept the floor, they squatted and did not move even if they had nothing to do; some veteran soldiers carried things for new comrades for a whole day, and the new soldiers did not say they would carry them themselves. New soldier Lǐ Jìngzhī of the machine gun and artillery company of the first battalion of the ×× regiment did not untie his leggings when crossing the river, and asked the squad leader to carry him over. The second time, he still wanted the deputy squad leader to carry him over. Therefore, in some units, there has been impatience or bad attitudes from veteran comrades helping new comrades, which affects the unity between new and veteran soldiers. Therefore, mobilizing veteran soldiers to help new soldiers should be combined with inspiring new soldiers to consciously become veteran soldiers quickly, so that new and veteran comrades can be united better in the spirit of mutual assistance and love.

    New soldiers cannot always be new soldiers, relying on veteran soldiers for everything, like being a guest. The ×× regiment adopted two methods. The machine gun and artillery company of the first battalion of the regiment adopted the method of directly mobilizing new soldiers in forums, saying that they cannot always be new people, they must improve themselves and quickly make themselves veteran soldiers, and not lag behind veteran soldiers in anything. The 4th company of the regiment adopted the method of using new soldier cadres to inspire new soldiers' self-awareness, explaining, "The veteran comrades are helping so actively, we are not happy to keep asking you to help! Now I propose that our platoon of new comrades challenge all the new comrades in the company, not to ask veteran comrades for help and to help veteran comrades." Once this challenge was made, the enthusiasm for mutual assistance between new and veteran soldiers rose.

    (4) Combining Life Care with Ideological Education
    Life care is only to give a good impression when they first arrive. To truly consolidate, it mainly relies on ideological education. Because new soldiers have just joined the army, everything makes them feel unfamiliar. The continuous marching and fighting life of the army makes them feel particularly unaccustomed. Especially when they are sick and cannot get good care, it will cause depression and homesickness, and various ideological fluctuations. It is very necessary to provide necessary care in life. Lǐ Zhìhéng, a new soldier of the machine gun and artillery company of the first battalion of the ×× regiment, fell ill, and the squad took out money to buy him chicken and sour plums to help him sweat. He recovered quickly, and Lǐ said gratefully and excitedly, "Squad leader, my illness is cured." Liáng Guìchāng said, "I thought the field army must be very hard? But when I came, the comrades treated me so well." However, in general, there is less ideological education than life care, especially there is even less understanding of those in the new soldiers who have deep family concepts or who are unwilling to join the army. There is no planned and in-depth understanding of the background and thinking of each new soldier and the psychological activities of new soldiers in various situations during marching and combat. Strengthening ideological education for new soldiers and grasping the ideological changes of new soldiers is an important reason for the desertions that occurred after this replenishment.

    (5) The More Difficult to Consolidate, the More We Must Strengthen Unity Work.
    This time, the new soldiers from Jingxing and Hunyuan were replenished in two batches. The first batch of Jingxing soldiers were mainly farmers who had turned over and were more conscious. The army did a better job in uniting these new soldiers. However, for the second batch of new soldiers from Hunyuan, there may have been some shortcomings in the way they were recruited. There were more desertions before they were replenished into the army. After being replenished into the army, they initially showed low morale and did not like to talk, and pretended to be sick. Some shortcomings occurred in the army's work in uniting these people. They learned to speak with the "Shanxi accent" of the Hunyuan people and ridiculed the Hunyuan soldiers by calling them "Mao Gao", making them even more afraid to speak. The veteran soldiers' impression of them became worse, which led to impatience and intolerance, showing that there was something wrong with our army's thinking on uniting new soldiers. Instead of strengthening the work the more difficult it was, we disliked it the more and relaxed the work the more. This is a wrong leadership thinking. This point should be corrected in the future.

    II. Several Experiences in Uniting and Consolidating New Soldiers

    (1) What Work Should Be Done When New Soldiers Arrive
    (1) The first impression is very important. Various larger welcome parties above the company level should be held to introduce the company commander, representatives of new and veteran soldiers should speak, or small-scale forums or "heart-to-heart talks" at the platoon level should be held for mutual introductions to achieve the purpose of preliminary understanding of composition, background, and origin. Special attention should be paid to a kind attitude, and actual actions should be used to break the idea that "the field army is savage and fierce," so that the new soldiers feel that everyone is amiable and kind as soon as they arrive, and give them a good impression first.
    (2) Appropriately assign new soldiers according to the situation of the unit, and immediately incorporate them into mutual aid groups, so that new soldiers can immediately get help from veteran soldiers in all aspects. The ×× regiment assigned them according to "which squads are convenient for new soldiers to consolidate and progress quickly." The machine gun and artillery company of the first battalion of the regiment also adopted the method of "first inspiring each squad to voluntarily request to supplement their own squad and guaranteeing good unity and consolidation and rapid progress," and then the company assigned them according to the actual situation. These are all better methods.
    (3) Grasp the several main thoughts of new soldiers when they join the army, and explain them according to their main thoughts to break their ideological concerns. According to the understanding, the main concerns of new soldiers when they first join the army are "fear of fighting," "fear of separation," "fear of being looked down upon by veteran soldiers," and "family problems that have not been resolved properly." According to the methods of the ×× regiment and the ×× regiment, it is necessary to emphasize that "separation is to help them progress, new comrades alone cannot complete the task, although everyone is not in the same squad, they are still not out of the same battalion and company" to overcome the fear of separation. Tell the new soldiers more about our stories of combat victory to increase their confidence. Point out that "learning skills will give you ways to fight, and high skills make you bold" to reassure them of their fear of fighting. It is necessary to point out that they are farmers who have turned over in the liberated areas and have good political quality, and the army needs them very much, and to promote the advantages of Jingxing and Hunyuan soldiers who can endure hardship and hard work. Veteran soldiers and liberated soldiers have high military skills, new and veteran comrades learn from each other's strengths, and no one can look down on anyone. In order to resolve their concerns about being looked down upon, let them write letters to tell their families and village cadres about problems that have not been resolved at home.

    (2) To Grasp the Law of Ideological Transformation of New Soldiers After Joining the Army, and the Work Should Keep Up in Time According to Their Different Ideological Evolutions
    (1) After the work of initially joining the army, two kinds of emotions will generally be produced in the new soldiers. One is high morale, actively demanding to learn, and actively demanding to be issued guns. For this kind of person, it is necessary to promote their political enthusiasm and strengthen their military and political education, especially to make them improve rapidly in technology. The other is that a small number of people with bad composition (landlord and rich peasant composition) or who are unwilling to come or who have particularly deep family concepts, their emotions are still low. For this kind of person, it is necessary to strengthen individual understanding, thoroughly and deeply understand their origins and thoughts, and strengthen individual conversations. This small part cannot be solved by general mobilization work.
    (2) After arduous marching and actual combat, a new change will occur in the thinking of new soldiers, and the idea of ​​fear of hardship and fatigue will be produced. For example, some new soldiers of the ×× regiment said: "If I knew that the field army was so hard, I would not participate in the field army no matter what I said." After actual combat, some will have the idea of ​​fear of death. The desertion of two new soldiers from the 5th company of the ×× regiment and the desertion of Liáng Tínglù, a new soldier of the ××× regiment, after the Shangxiadian battle, were all like this. Therefore, we must grasp the psychological activities and ideological changes of new soldiers in these situations and conduct timely explanations and education to avoid the occurrence of low morale or desertion.

    (3) Caring for and Caring for New Soldiers and Appropriately Solving Their Practical Difficulties
    New soldiers have just been replenished to the unit, and because they are unfamiliar, they are unwilling to say anything if they have problems or encounter difficulties. Therefore, it is particularly important to take the initiative to solve their difficulties when new soldiers first arrive.
    (1) Tell and teach them the daily life of the army that new soldiers do not understand, such as "what are the rules and regulations of the army," "how to pack a backpack," and "how to wipe a gun," etc.; help them find furniture for eating, and veteran soldiers should do more of the daily chores that new soldiers do not know; in short, try not to make them feel too difficult in life.
    (2) When new soldiers have diseases, care for and urge them to treat them, and adjust their nutrition. Wáng Tiěsuǒ and Chén Sìyá, new soldiers of the 2nd company of the ×× regiment, had toothaches. The company bought white flour and chicken, and the instructor personally sent them to the squad to comfort them. The deputy political instructor comforted them at night, and then found a good urinal and closed the door before returning to the company headquarters. The new soldiers felt very affectionate. The cadres smiled and asked them to sit down when they went to the squad, which quickly broke the gap between the cadres and the new soldiers. Veteran comrades of the ×× regiment got up at night to cover the new comrades with quilts. Therefore, some new soldiers said: "It is more attentive than my parents taking care of me at home."
    (3) Take care of the new soldiers in marching and pay attention to mutual assistance in physical strength. New soldiers have not walked long distances, and the army is marching fast, and they are not used to it, plus the full set of equipment of the general soldiers, the weight is very large, and marching makes them very strenuous; therefore, mutual assistance in physical strength for new soldiers during marching should be taken care of well, they can be asked to undertake less of the various chores in action, asked them to carry less things, and after camping, arrange for them to wash their feet and rest first, and teach them "how to treat foot blisters"; in short, the veteran soldiers should take care of them first in everything they eat, drink, sleep, live, and walk.

    (4) Lead New Soldiers to Fight, Teach Them How to Act, and Pay Attention to Their Safety
    (1) Before the war, emphasize the method of veteran soldiers leading new soldiers to fight, and explain and mobilize the new soldiers separately before the war. Encourage them while charging in battle, do not get impatient, and do not satirize them for being "afraid of death." The ×× regiment did a good job in this regard in the Shangxiadian battle. After the war, a forum for new soldiers was held, and when soliciting opinions, none of the new soldiers complained or were dissatisfied with the veteran soldiers. They only expressed special gratitude to the comrades who were injured for taking care of the new comrades, saying, "They were just pulling us, and as a result, they were implicated and suffered losses."
    (2) Lead and teach new soldiers the specific actions of combat from the specific actions of combat. When the 1st company of the ××× regiment was fighting in Shangxiadian, the veteran soldiers would tell the new comrades to lie down when they should lie down, and tell them that the enemy had run away when the enemy ran away (because sometimes they did not dare to look up to see the situation). This is a good opportunity to charge and encourage them to charge. New soldier Lín Xiǎowǔ said: "So that's how you fight! We're not afraid anymore." New soldier Zhāng Bǐngshān was slightly injured because he did not dare to charge and fell behind. The deputy company commander immediately mobilized him, "Charge quickly! You will suffer more if you are behind in mountain warfare." Zhāng immediately charged up.
    (3) Take care of the safety of new soldiers in dangerous situations. When the 1st company of the ××× regiment was attacking the South Mountain in Shangxiadian, an enemy grenade came over, and the 3rd platoon leader of the company immediately pushed two new soldiers away, but he could not dodge himself and was injured for the sake of the two new soldiers. To pass through the area blockaded by the enemy to dig fortifications in the 6th company of the regiment, the new soldiers did not dare to pass, and the veteran soldiers dug them for the new soldiers. The 2nd platoon leader personally sent the new soldiers to the trenches to eat in order to ensure the safety of the new soldiers when the enemy shot. These are all very good ways to take care of new soldiers in dangerous situations.
    (4) After the war, understand the psychological thoughts of new soldiers in time and comfort them in time. The morale of some new soldiers in the 1st company of the ×× regiment, which suffered heavy casualties, was low. They held a forum in a timely manner and explained it based on the psychology of the new soldiers, so that the morale of the new soldiers changed more quickly. The 6th company of the × regiment adopted the method of cadres going to the squads to comfort the new soldiers after the war.

    III. Overcoming the Shortcomings in the Work of Uniting and Consolidating New Soldiers
    (1) Not Enough Attention is Paid to the Unity and Use of Cadres who Joined the Army Among the New Soldiers, and They Have Not Been Able to Give Full Play to Their Role and Make Them a Force for Uniting and Consolidating New Soldiers. Among the new soldier cadres supplemented this time, both the ×× regiment and the ×× regiment had cadres who joined the army deserting. This was due to the improper placement of these cadres and the lack of attention to their ideological education and use. In the future, when there are cadres who join the army, they can be temporarily placed at the regimental and battalion levels to be specifically responsible for checking, understanding, helping, uniting, and consolidating the work of new soldiers. This will give greater play to their strength. After a period of time, it will be more appropriate to formally assign them to work.
    (2) There is no universal, planned, and in-depth understanding of the new soldiers, and ideological education is strengthened according to their specific thoughts from different backgrounds. This is manifested in the lack of in-depth understanding of the backgrounds and thoughts of the new soldiers, and lax and paralyzed management, especially after crossing the PingSui Road. Most of the regiments thought that the new soldiers would not run away again after crossing the road, so they were paralyzed in their thinking and lax in their management, which once caused serious desertions of new soldiers.
    (3) Impatience in uniting new soldiers, and erroneous behaviors of beating and scolding new soldiers occur. Some companies have some biases among the veteran soldiers, especially the 8th company of the ×× regiment towards the new soldier Yáng Jùnshēng. Comrade Yang joined the party in 1940, participated in local work, served as the director of the village farmers association for many years, and distributed 21 acres of land. The farmers who turned over voluntarily joined the army, but because of night blindness, and at the same time had the ideological problem of not wanting to work in the company, he had dropped out of the team twice, which made the whole squad suffer a lot. The company did not understand deeply, and determined that he was deliberately causing trouble, and his attitude towards him was very bad, which made this new soldier very unhappy. The company also reflected several times and requested that he be dealt with. Only after the regiment sent someone to understand the situation did they understand these situations. This attitude towards new soldiers is completely wrong.

    The above successful experiences should be accepted, and the lessons of failure should be transformed to improve our work of uniting and consolidating new soldiers.

　　关于团结巩固新战士的经验和教训
    华北第二兵团某旅政治部总结·流星整理
    人民解放军的干部与战士、战士与战士，是阶级战友关系，是革命同志关系。由于人民解放军的本质，和广大指战员对这一本质的觉悟，内部关系是团结的，从政治、经济、文化以至军事，有着充分的民主生活，而民主又是为了相互启发与提高觉悟、加强友爱团结、提高战斗力、集中意志、集中力量，以消灭敌人。人民解放军之所以巩固与不可战胜的原因之一，即在于它具有正确的内部关系，因此即使在部队迅速扩大的情况下，新战士在干部与老战士的带领与帮助下，在革命大家庭的温暖教育下，能迅速变为老战士，使部队经得起严重的战争考验。华北人民解放军野战军二兵团某旅在团结巩固新战士的工作中的经验是好的。首先在于他们正确的认识了人民解放军的内部关系，在这种正确思想指导下，进行一系列的工作，做到三十二个连队无一逃亡，既反对了军阀主义的带兵方法，又反对了盲目的对新战士某些落后意识迁就，而用团结互助，达到启发与提高觉悟的目的。必须指出，我们部队对这一问题，还不是普遍彻底解决了的，若干部队还恶劣的采取了对新战士不信任和消极防范的方法，这是背叛阶级、违反人民解放军本质的思想行为，必须纠正，而二兵团某旅的巩固工作正是对这种思想行为的有力批判。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　编者
    此次我们先后补充了井陉、浑源两批新战士，共计七百九十二名，补入五十个伙食单位。从谢家堡一带出发，经过了上下店战斗，爬山涉水，越过平绥、平古路，到达冀东，共逃亡二十八个，三十二个连队无一逃亡。在这一时期团结巩固新战士工作上获得了一些经验，同时也得到了一些很痛切的教训，现根据各团现有的材料，提出以下几点，供全军参考。
    一　在团结巩固新战士的思想上要取得统一
    （一）初来欢迎与长期爱护必须相结合
    新战士初来，各团大部做到：列队欢迎，买肉买菜、改善伙食、买些山货、茶果、纸烟、烧水开座谈会，互相介绍。老战士并赠送一些日用品（手巾、军衣）给新战士，表示老同志对新同志的热情关切，成了我们部队的一种习惯。但已往的缺点是初来欢迎作的好，长期爱护做的差，影响新兵巩固与提高，所以这次特别强调克服此点。在新战士补入部队之后，仍能从各方面照顾与爱护新战士，在行军中普遍体力互助。××团许多连队行动中不让新同志站岗，该团七连八班每到宿营地先让新同志洗脚、休息，老战士晚休息，挖工事替新同志挖，打仗时具体分工带领他们，一有空就教新战士学习刺杀和射击，证明了初来欢迎必须和长期爱护相结合才能巩固与提高。
    （二）提高阶级觉悟与提高军事技术相结合
    依靠新战士翻身得田已有的觉悟，鼓励他们保田保家，激起他们打败蒋介石的高度革命热情。象××团一营机炮连等连队，在这次新战士补入之后，座谈会上就着重的进行了这一教育。但过去认为巩固新战士主要是政治工作，未注重提高新战士的军事技术（新战士很着重这一点，感到不会打枪，不会打手榴弹，没法打仗），这次各部比较过去注意。××团一营副营长刘庆三同志根据新战士怕打仗的主要心理，灵活采用边讲边比划，把新战士初上战场的动作一点一滴的讲清楚，很实际，使新战士实战动作收到良好效果。××团六连新战士刘铁林在个人好学与老同志积极帮助下，一周就学会了拆上机枪，老战士一有空就教新战士射击刺杀，各团并普遍让新战士实习投掷了一次手榴弹，使新战士学会与敢于实际投弹，所以这次上下店战斗中有的新战士把个人手榴弹打完了，××团五连×××和××团新战士都有负了轻伤还随老战士冲锋，这是重视新战士军事技术提高的结果。
    （三）发动老战士帮助新战士与启发新战士自觉相结合
    这次新战士来后，老战士很热情，特别在生活照顾上，拿出自己的衬衣、手巾、袜子给新同志。××团一营机炮连为了解决新同志吃饭没碗的困难，老战士把个人的小碗给了新战士，等发了新的又拿新的换回旧的。五连三班的老战士把个人小碗给了新战士用，个人借不到就用小铁锨和瓦片吃，都给新同志以极大的感动，有的新战士说：“同志们待我们这么好，我们没别的，只有好好向你们学习。”××团五连刘年说：“以前我想家，同志们待我这么好，以后好好干，不想家了。”
    但有的一小部分新战士在老战士这样帮助下并不自觉，老战士抢着打饭，他们就等着吃；老战士扫地，没有事他们蹲着也不动；老战士有的给新同志一背背一天东西，新战士也不说自己背。××团一营机炮连新战士李敬之过河不解绑腿，让班长背他过去，第二次仍想让副班长背过去。因此在某些单位，已产生老同志帮助新同志不耐心或态度不好的现象，影响新老团结。因此在发动老战士互助新战士，应与启发新战士自觉迅速变为老战士相结合，才能使新老同志在互助互爱的精神上团结的更好。
    新战士不能总作新战士，样样靠老战士帮助，象作客一样。××团他们采用的办法有两种，该团一营机炮连采用座谈会直接动员新战士，不能总作新人，要提高自己，迅速使自己变成老战士，样样也不落在老战士后边。该团四连采用利用新兵干部启发新战士自觉，说明“老同志这样积极帮助，我们老叫你帮助也不乐意呀！现在我提议咱们排新同志向全连新同志提出挑战，不叫老同志帮助并帮助老同志”，这样一经挑战，新老战士互相帮助情绪起来了。
    （四）生活照顾与思想教育相结合
    生活照顾只是才来时，给与良好印象，要想真正巩固主要依靠思想教育。因为新战士刚刚入伍，一切都使他感到生疏，部队连续行军作战的生活，特别感到不习惯，尤其生病得不到很好的照顾，更会引起苦闷、想家，种种思想波动，在生活上给以必要照顾很需要。××团一营机炮连新战士李志恒病了，班里拿出钱给他买鸡子，买酸干见汗。病很快好了，李又感激又兴奋的说：“班长我的病好了”。梁贵昌说：“我以为野战军不定多苦呢？可是来了同志们待我这么强。”但一般的对思想教育不如生活照顾多，特别对新战士中家庭观念深或个别不愿参军的了解更差，没有有计划深刻的了解每一新战士的来历与思想和在行军、作战各种不同情况下新战士的心理活动，加强对新战士的思想教育，掌握新战士的思想变化，这是造成此次补充后发生逃亡的重要原因。
    （五）越不好巩固的我们越要加强团结工作。
    此次井陉、浑源新战士，我们是分两批补入的。第一次井陉战士因该区是翻身农民多，觉悟程度较高、部队在团结这批新战士作的也较好，但第二批补入的浑源新战士，因该区扩兵方式上可能有些缺点，未补入部队前逃亡较多，补入部队后，初表现情绪不高，不爱说话，伪装病号，部队团结这些人上则发生一些缺点，学浑源人说话的“山西口音”，讽刺浑源战士叫“毛糕”，使他们越不敢说话，老战士对他们的印象越坏，产生急燥，不耐烦，表示了我们部队团结新战士的思想有毛病，不是越不好越加强工作，而是越不好越讨厌，越放松工作，这是错误的领导思想。今后应纠正此点。
    二　团结巩固新战士的几个经验
    （一）新战士来时要做哪些工作
    （１）第一个印象很重要，要召开各种不同的连以上较大的欢迎晚会，介绍连的首长，新老战士代表讲话，或以排的小规模的座谈会、“谈心会”，进行互相介绍，达到初步了解成份、出身、来历的目的，态度要特别注意和霭，以实际行动来打破认为“野战军野蛮厉害”的想法，使新战士一来就感到大家和霭可亲，先给他一个好印象。
    （２）根据部队情况适当分配新战士，立即编入互助组，使新战士能马上得到老战士各方面的帮助。××团是根据“哪些班便于新战士巩固与进步快就编入那班”。该团一营机炮连并采用了“先启发各班自动要求补充本班，保证团结巩固的好和进步快”的方式，连再根据实际情况分配，这些都是较好的办法。
    （３）掌握紧新战士入伍时几个主要思想，根据其主要思想进行解释，打破其思想顾虑。根据了解新战士初入伍时主要是“怕打仗”“怕分开”“怕老战士看不起”“家庭有些琐事没处理清的挂牵家庭问题”，根据××团与××团的办法，要强调“分开是为了帮助他们进步，单独新同志在一起不能完成任务，大家虽不在一个班，仍出不了一个营、连”克服怕分散的心理。多给新战士讲我们战斗胜利的故事，提高他们的信心。指出“学会技术就有了打仗的办法，艺高人胆大”，安抚他们怕打仗的心理。要指出：他们是解放区的翻身农民，政治质量好，部队很需要他们，并发扬井陉、浑源兵能吃苦耐劳的优点。老战士和解放战士军事技术高，新老同志取长补短，谁也不能看不起谁。以解决其怕看不起的顾虑，对家里有问题没处理的，让他们写信告诉家里和村干。
    （二）要掌握新战士入伍后的思想转变规律，根据其不同思想演变，工作要及时的跟上去
    （１）经过初入伍的工作之后，在新战士中一般的会产生两种情绪，一种是情绪高涨，积极要求学习，积极要求发枪，对这种人就要发扬其政治热情，加强其军政教育，特别技术上使其迅速提高一步；另一种则是少数成份不好（地富成份）或不愿来或家庭观念特深的，情绪仍表现低落，对这种人则要加强个别了解，彻底深刻了解其来历与思想，加强个别谈话，对这一小部分即不是一般鼓动工作能解决问题的。
    （２）经过艰苦的行军与实际战斗后，新战士在思想上则又发生一种新的变化，怕苦怕累的思想即产生。如××团有的新战士说：“我要知道野战军这么苦，我说什么也不参加野战军。”经过实际战斗有的即产生怕死的思想，上下店战斗后，××团五连两个新战士的逃亡，×××团新战士梁庭路的逃亡，都是如此。因此我们必须掌握在这些情况下新兵的心理活动、思想变化及时进行解释教育，以免情绪低落或逃亡现象的发生。
    （三）关心爱护新战士并适当解决他们的实际困难
    新战士刚一补到部队，因为生疏，有问题或碰到困难也不愿说，因此对新战士初来时解决他们的困难，要特别主动。
    （１）把部队日常生活，新战士不了解的都告诉与教给他们，象部队“有哪些制度规定”，“怎样打背包”，“怎样擦枪”等；吃饭的家具要帮他们找，日常勤务新战士不知道，老战士就多去干；总之，生活上尽量不使其感受过分困难。
    （２）新战士遇有疾病时，关心与督促他们治疗，营养上予以调剂。××团二连新战士王铁锁陈四牙病了，连里买白面鸡子，指导员亲自送到班上慰问，晚上副政指安慰，以后还找好尿盆关好门才回连部休息，新战士感到十分亲热，干部到班里笑着让坐，很快打破了干部与新战士之间的隔阂。××团老同志晚上起来给新同志盖被子。所以有的新战士说：“比在家里爹娘照顾的还周到。”
    （３）行军中照顾新战士注意体力互助。新战士没走过远道，部队行军快，他们也不习惯，再加上一般战士的全套装备，重量很大，行军使他们很吃力；因此行军中对新战士体力互助要照顾好，可以少叫他们负担行动中的各种勤务，叫他们少背东西，宿营后按置他们先洗脚先休息，教给他们“怎样治脚泡”；总之对他们吃、喝、睡、住、走，样样先老战士给以照顾。
    （四）带领新战士作战，教给他们怎样动作，注意他们的安全
    （１）在战前强调老战士带领新战士作战，在战前强调老战士带领新战士的办法，并对新战士单独进行解释动员，战斗中要边冲锋边鼓励他，不发急燥，别讽刺他们“怕死”。××团上下店战斗在这方面作的很好，战后开了一次新兵座谈会，征求意见时新战士表现没有一个对老战士抱怨或不满，只是对为照顾新同志而负伤的同志表示特别感激说：“净为拉我们，结果挂带了他们吃亏。”
    （２）从战斗具体动作上带领与教给新战士动作。×××团一连在上下店战斗时该卧倒老战士就告诉新同志卧倒，敌人跑时就告诉他们敌人跑了（因为有时他不敢抬起头来看情况），这是冲锋的好机会，鼓励他们冲锋。新战士林小五说：“打仗就这样打呀！以后我们不怕了。”新战士张炳山因不敢冲锋落在后边而负了轻伤，副连长马上动员他“快冲吧！山地作战越在后边越吃亏”，张立即就冲上去了。
    （３）危险情况下要照顾新战士的安全，×××团一连在攻击上下店南山头时，敌人一颗手榴弹打来，该连三排长立即把两个新战士一推，可是个人已躲不及，为了两个新战士个人负了伤。该团六连挖工事要通过敌人封锁的地方，新战士不敢过，老战士就替新战士挖好，敌人打枪新战士不敢出工事吃饭，二排长为了新战士安全，个人亲自给新战士送战壕里去吃，这些在危险情况下照顾新战士都是很好的。
    （４）战后要及时了解新战士心理思想及时进行安慰。××团伤亡较大的一连新战士有些情绪低落，他们及时的召开了座谈会，根据新战士的心理，进行了解释，使新战士情绪才较快的转变过来。×团六连则采取了干部分头到班安抚新兵战后情绪。
    三　克复团结巩固新战士工作中的缺点
    （一）对新战士中参军干部的团结与使用不够重视，未能充分发挥其作用使其成为团结巩固新战士的一个力量。此次补入之新兵干部××团××团均有参军干部逃亡，都是由于对这些干部安插不够恰当，未注意其思想教育与使用的原因，今后再有参军干部可暂放到团、营两级，专门负责检查了解帮助团结巩固新战士的工作，这样发挥力量较大，经过一个时期后，再正式分配工作较为恰当。
    （二）对新战士没有普遍有计划深刻的进行了解，而根据其不同来历具体思想加强其思想教育，表现在对新战士来历、思想了解不深刻、管理松懈麻痹，特别过了平绥路以后，各团多数认为过了路新战士不会再开小差，思想麻痹，管理松懈，曾造成新战士一度逃亡严重。
    （三）对新战士团结不耐心，发生有打骂新战士的错误行为。有的连队在老战士中曾发生一些偏向，特别××团八连对新战士杨俊生。该同志一九四○年入党，参加地方工作，任村农会主任多年，并分田二十一亩，翻身农民自动参军，但因雀朦眼，同时又有不愿在连队工作的思想毛病，掉过两次队，使全班跟他受累很大，连队也不深加了解，即认定他是故意挑皮，对他态度非常不好，使这个新战士情绪很不好，连队还反映几次要求处理，经团派专人了解才了解出这些情形，这种对待新战士的态度，完全是错误的。
    以上成功的经验要接受，失败的教训要转变，改进我们的团结巩固新战士的工作。
