[Jinzhong Electric Dispatch] The people's militia from the old liberated areas of Central Hebei, Northern Yue, and Taihang, who traveled hundreds of miles to participate in the Taiyuan campaign, are all peasants who have been emancipated through land reform. In completing the arduous task of supporting the front, various heroes and models have emerged. The people's militia from the Fourth District of Northern Yue arrived at the front line after a 19-day forced march, and their morale remained high. In letters home, they expressed their determination to "not go home until Taiyuan is captured." More than a thousand militiamen from Zhaoxian and Gaocheng in Central Hebei only had one meal in two days and one night, but they still disregarded hunger, fatigue, and danger to complete the task of transporting 26,219 hand grenades. Wang Daku from Jin County said, "Let's do it! I won't be impatient even if I have to walk to the ends of the earth." Model team member Han Guliu said, "Carry faster! The faster we carry, the faster Yan Xishan will die." Many people insisted on completing their tasks even when they were sick. For example, Guo Tingsheng from Jin County continued to work despite limping. Militia platoon leader Li Tuzi continued to carry burdens like other team members, even though his feet were cracked. In emergency situations, Communist Party members demonstrated even greater heroism. Party member Qu Wandong and two others led three people who volunteered to join the dare-to-die team, helping the troops carry explosives to the enemy's bunker. The Taihang Xingtai militia traveled back and forth ten miles on muddy mountain roads, transporting supplies for three days and nights continuously. When the troops had just captured the blockhouse of Shantou Village, the Wang Hulin group from the Licheng accompanying militia went up to carry the wounded, but because it was dark, they accidentally stepped on a landmine, which dazed them. However, they still carried the wounded to the rear.

　　各地民工斗志坚决
  　不打下太原不回家
    【晋中电】从数百里外赶来参加太原战役的冀中、北岳、太行老区民工，他们都是经过了土改的翻身农民。在完成艰苦的支前任务中，涌出各种英雄与模范。北岳四区民工，经十九天的急行军到达前线，情绪依然高涨。在家信中表示了“不打下太原不回家”的决心。冀中赵县、藁城千余民工，两天一夜只吃过一顿饭，仍不顾饥饿、疲劳、危险，完成运输二万六千二百一十九个手榴弹的任务。晋县王大窟说：“干吧！走到天边也不燥急”。模范队员韩古留说：“快抬呀！越抬的快，阎锡山越死的快”。许多人带病还坚持完成任务。如晋县郭廷生一拐一拐的仍不休息。民工排长李秃子，脚裂了还和其他队员一样扛。在紧急情况中，共产党员更表现了无限的英勇。党员屈万东等三人带领三个群众自报参加奋勇队，帮助部队把炸药扛到敌人碉堡前。太行邢台民工在泥泞的山坡路上往返十里，连运三昼夜。黎城随军民工，当部队刚打下山头村炮楼时，王虎林组便上去抬伤号，但因天黑不小心踏响了地雷，震的他们昏头昏脑，可是他们仍背着伤号送到后方。
