　　Embrace Past Tree Planting Experience
  　Vigorously Develop Cooperative Afforestation
    What should we do in the future? The conference also made arrangements. First, according to this year's survey by the Hebei Jizhong Administrative Office Afforestation Team, there are 385,974 mu of sandy land in 247 villages in the eight counties with more sandy land in central Hebei. Among them, completely barren land accounts for 70 percent; land with yields of three dou or less accounts for 30 percent. In the future, the focus of afforestation will be on sandy waste areas, carried out in three seasons a year, with long-term plans. Second, every cadre who organizes the masses to plant trees must establish a new concept: that they are planting trees for the masses, not completing tasks for higher authorities. And clarify this concept in the minds of the masses. When mobilizing the masses to plant trees, it is necessary to be realistic, starting from the local afforestation conditions and the needs and habits of the masses, and let the masses discuss the organizational methods and the distribution of benefits, so that the masses regard it as their own business, and carry it out in a planned and leadership-led manner, avoiding any coercion or formalism. In the future, we will focus on developing cooperative afforestation, and expand and improve the old tree associations of the masses, and avoid collective afforestation that is temporarily encouraged. Cooperative afforestation needs to pay attention to the principles of democracy, voluntarism, and equivalent mutual benefit. Shareholding, dividends, tree trimming, and tree watching should be fully discussed and clear methods should be formulated. Tree planting should be technically sound, relying on the experience of the local masses to find out how to plant for better survival. Third, in terms of forest protection: First, we must publicize the government's forest protection policies and the "Measures for Rewarding and Protecting Tree Planting and Afforestation" to the masses. Second, check the forest protection situation this year, good forest protection methods can be promoted, and inappropriate places should be modified. If there are tree watchers, pay attention to combining their interests with tree watching. Third, strengthen forest protection education in primary schools and winter schools. Children often damage trees, so education should be especially strengthened. Fourth, in necessary areas, we can discuss with the masses to ban wasteland reclamation and protect wild seedlings. Fifth, the trees that have been planted alive should be protected, and the roadside trees on highways should be covered with soil; those that have died should be replanted in a planned manner. Fourth, the success of afforestation this autumn lies in the survival rate, not simply pursuing numbers, and strive for a survival rate of 90 percent.
    After the meeting, the Administrative Office Afforestation Team, the Promotion Team, and the Xinji Farm, a total of 48 people, formed four working groups, selected key points, went to the countryside to carry out afforestation demonstrations in sandy and alkaline land, and organized the masses to carry out afforestation.

　　接受过去植树经验
  　大力发展合作造林
    今后怎么做呢？会议也都做了布置。一、根据行署造林队今年调查，冀中沙地较多的八个县二百四十七个村子，共有沙地三十八万五千九百七十四亩。其中全荒占百分之七十；三斗以下产量地占百分之三十。今后造林重点放在沙荒地区，一年三季，长期有计划的去搞。二、每一个组织群众栽树的干部，都要树立一个新的观念：是给群众栽树，不是给上级完成任务。并把这个观念在群众思想上明确起来发动群众栽树，一定要实事求是，从当地造林条件和群众要求、习惯出发，由群众自己讨论组织办法和收益分配问题，使群众当成自己的事，并且有计划、有领导的去作，避免任何强迫命令和形式主义。今后以发展合作造林为主，并就群众旧有的树会加以扩充与提高，不搞临时鼓励起来的集体造林。合作造林需要注意民主自愿和等价两利的原则。入股、分红、修树、看树都要充分讨论，订出明确的办法。栽树要讲求技术，依靠当地群众的经验，弄清怎样栽才好活。三、护林方面：第一、要向群众宣传政府的护林政策和“奖励与保护植树造林”办法。第二、检查今年的护林情形，好的护林办法可以推广，不适当的地方要加以修改。有看树人的，要注意跟看树人利益的结合。第三、在小学和冬学里加强护林教育。儿童常糟害树木，应特别加强教育。第四、在必要的地区，可和群众商量禁荒，并保护野生树苗。第五、已经栽活了的树木，要注意保护，公路行道树要封上土堆；已经死了的要有计划的补栽。四、今年秋后造林的成绩在于成活的多少，不要单纯追求数字，争取成活率到百分之九十。
    会后，行署造林队、推广队与辛集农场共四十八人组成四个工作组，分别选定重点，下乡进行沙荒碱地造林示范，组织群众造林。（李云）
