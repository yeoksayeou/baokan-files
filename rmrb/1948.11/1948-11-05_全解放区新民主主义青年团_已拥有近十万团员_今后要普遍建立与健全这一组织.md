Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th—In just over two years of development, the New Democratic Youth League has become a youth organization with nearly 100,000 members, welcomed by the masses. The New Democratic Youth League was born out of the proposal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in October 1946. Young activists in individual schools, factories, and villages in Yan'an and Suide counties of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region were the first to respond to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and began to pilot this youth league. Subsequently, it gradually spread to other counties and other liberated areas. Up to now, all liberated areas, except for the Central Plains Liberated Area newly opened last year, have organizations of the Youth League. According to not very precise statistics, the current number of league members is approximately 60,000 in Shandong, approximately 20,000 in North China, approximately 10,000 in Northeast China, approximately 6,000 in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, and approximately 2,000 in Jin-Sui.

	The New Democratic Youth League is a mass organization of advanced youth under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. It takes the complete overthrow of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism's rule in China and the establishment of a new democratic New China as its overall goal. The facts of the past two years have proven that this new type of youth organization has a promising future for development.

	In the past two years, under the leadership, call, and assistance of the Party and the government, the Youth League in various regions has made many efforts and achieved preliminary results in the Liberation War and various mass movements for the common interests of the entire people and the special interests of the youth themselves. The Youth League is a leading force in joining the army, participating in the war, and supporting the front lines. In Dingxian and Pingshan counties of Hebei, most of those who signed up first during this year's army expansion were Youth League members. Among the 6,000 Youth League members in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, more than 500 have voluntarily joined the army. The Youth League has made significant contributions to the war against Hu Zongnan's bandit army in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia. Male league members carried stretchers, and female league members served as nurses, and most of them could play a model role and motivate others. During the occupation of Yan'an by Hu bandits, all members of the Fengzhuang Youth League in Yan'an actively participated in the war and joined the army, insisting on fighting the enemy. In extremely difficult days, the organizational life of the league was still maintained regularly. When league members were captured by the enemy, they were subjected to severe torture, but they remained steadfast and did not reveal any secrets. When Yan'an was liberated, they immediately responded to the government's call and organized mutual aid teams to carry out mutual aid production.

	In rural areas, the Youth League promoted young people inside and outside the league to participate in the anti-feudal struggle during the land reform. In many places, more than 90% of young men and women participated in various practical tasks in the land reform. Due to the courage and frankness of the young people, they often stood at the forefront of the struggle. They dared to speak out fair words that many adults were unwilling to say. When distributing fruits, many league members were able to be selfless and put others before themselves. In production movements and learning movements, league members demonstrated their autonomy and initiative. The Youth League is often the initiator or the first participant in rural labor mutual aid. Most rural Youth Leagues conduct production mutual aid after establishing organizations. Many mutual aid teams are easily able to persist for a long time because the Youth League serves as the political core. The Youth League of Jin-Sui organized small mutual aid groups such as manure delivery mutual aid and wasteland reclamation mutual aid. The youth mutual aid teams in Zizhou County (western Suide) and Wubu County of northern Shaanxi often voluntarily help military families and cadre families with farming. The mutual aid team initiated by the Youth League in Wentang Village, Pingshan, Hebei, greatly improved the efficiency of farming and weaving. They put forward the slogan "Production and learning are both important" and automatically organized youth afternoon schools and youth night schools to carry out reading newspapers, literacy, and various cultural and recreational activities.

	The Youth League has also achieved significant results in urban factories. In several important factories in Northeast China, Jin-Sui, and northern Shaanxi, there are organizations of the league. Under the education of the league, young workers have raised their awareness and cultivated new labor attitudes. The Youth League members in some factories initiated production competitions with "more output and better quality," which achieved good results. Youth League members in Harbin have shown many exemplary performances in protecting machinery, saving raw materials, observing labor discipline, carrying out labor mutual aid, and improving the relationship between masters and apprentices.

	The Youth League plays a backbone role in many schools. In famous universities and many primary and secondary schools in Northeast China, league members actively help improve school education and ensure the completion of education plans. Most of the Youth League members in Yan'an Xingzhi Middle School are good students with excellent academic performance. In addition to studying their regular courses well, many student league members use extracurricular activities such as forums, lectures, wall newspapers, exhibitions, military exercises, target practice, marching, climbing, traveling, and visiting as auxiliary forms of learning to acquire knowledge in various aspects. League members can generally play a model role in observing school rules, respecting teachers, and loving classmates.

	The organizational leadership of the Youth League and the mutual assistance of league members have solved many difficult problems for young people themselves, which were not easily solved in the past. Under the correct education and sound organizational life of the league, some bad habits that young people have acquired from the old society have gradually been transformed. In some places, it has played a role in changing customs and habits, bringing a new atmosphere to the entire youth community. Due to the performance of these actual facts, the Youth League has received good comments and support from teachers and parents.

	The New Democratic Youth League has achieved the above-mentioned achievements because of its work that benefits the people and the youth themselves, rather than because of its name. A few local Youth League cadres did not recognize the significance of establishing the league, and they established the league for the sake of establishing the league. The recruitment of league members was not based on personal awareness and voluntariness, forming cadre monopoly, pursuing formalism, coveting quantity, and not paying attention to educating league members and cultivating activists and leading backbones, resulting in the league's organization and work going awry. The errors in the Youth League's work in these places have been corrected or are being corrected after being discovered.

	Now, under the leadership of the local Party committees, the Youth Leagues in various regions are actively carrying out the work of strengthening leadership, unifying institutions, cultivating cadres, and improving and developing organizations. Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Northeast China have convened youth work conferences and established preparatory committees for the Youth League in the entire region. Youth work conferences in North China and Jin-Sui will also be held soon. These regions have transferred outstanding cadres with youth work experience from all sides to lead this work. Northeast China and Shandong have opened training classes for Youth League cadres. The school for training national Youth League cadres has also been opened by the Youth Work Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

	With the victorious development of the Liberation War, in order to unite and educate the broad masses of young people, to train a large number of revolutionary reserve forces who have been trained ideologically, politically, and culturally, and to give greater play to the active role of young people in the revolutionary war and the cause of new democratic construction, it is required to universally establish and improve the organization of the Youth League in all liberated areas with appropriate conditions. This work is one of the important tasks of the entire Party.

    全解放区新民主主义青年团
    已拥有近十万团员
    今后要普遍建立与健全这一组织
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】仅仅经过两年多历史的发展，新民主主义青年团已经成了一个拥有将近十万团员受群众欢迎的青年队伍。新民主主义青年团的诞生是由于中共中央一九四六年十月的提议。陕甘宁边区的延安和绥德两县的个别学校、工厂与村庄里的青年积极分子，首先响应了中共中央的号召，着手试办这种青年团。接着在别的县份，别的解放区，逐渐推广起来。到现在，各解放区，除去年新开辟的中原解放区外，都有了青年团的组织。据不甚精确的统计，现有团员人数，山东约六万，华北约二万，东北约一万，陕甘宁约六千，晋绥约二千。
    新民主主义青年团是中共领导下的先进青年的群众组织  它以彻底推翻帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义在中国的统治，建立新民主主义的新中国为奋斗的总目标。两年来的事实证明，这样一种新式的青年组织，是有着远大发展前途的。
    两年来，各地青年团在党与政府的领导、号召和帮助之下，在解放战争和各种群众运动当中，为着整个人民的共同利益与青年自身的特殊利益，都作了不少的努力并获得了初步的成绩。青年团在参军参战与支援前线方面是一支带头的力量。河北定县平山等地今年扩军中，首先报名的，多是青年团员，陕甘宁六千团员中，先后自动参军者达到五百多人。青年团在陕甘宁反对胡宗南匪军的战争中作了显著的贡献。男团员抬担架、女团员当看护，大都能起模范作用，推动别人。延安冯庄青年团在胡匪侵占延安期间，全体团员踊跃参战参军，坚持对敌斗争。在极艰苦的日子里，团的组织生活仍经常保持。团员在被敌人捕去时，受尽严刑拷打，始终坚贞不屈，不泄露任何秘密。当延安光复后，他们立即响应政府号召，组织变工队，进行互助生产。
    农村中的青年团，在土地改革中，推动了团内外的青年参加反封建斗争。有许多地方百分之九十以上的男女青年都参加了土地改革中的各种实际工作。由于青年们的勇敢和坦率，他们往往站在斗争的最前列。他们敢于说出许多成年人所不愿说的公道话。在分配果实时，许多团员们都能大公无私，先人后己。在生产运动与学习运动中，团员们表现了他们的自动性与积极性。青年团常常是农村劳动互助的发起人或最先参加者。多数的农村青年团在建立了组织之后，便进行生产互助。不少的变工队，因为有青年团作为政治核心，才易于长久坚持。晋绥的青年团组织了送粪变工、开荒变工等小型互助组。陕北子洲县（绥德西部）吴堡县的青年变工队，经常自动帮助军属、干属耕种。河北平山温塘村青年团所发起的变工队，使耕作与纺织的效率大大提高，他们提出“生产学习两不误”的口号，自动组织青年午校、青年夜校，进行读报识字与各种文化娱乐活动。
    青年团在城市工厂中也获得了显著的成绩。在东北、晋绥、陕北的若干重要工厂中，都有了团的组织。青年工人在团的教育下，提高了觉悟，培养了新的劳动态度。有些工厂的青年团发起“产量多，质量好”的生产竞赛，收到良好效果。哈尔滨的青工团员，在爱护机器，节省原料，遵守劳动纪律，进行劳动互助，改善师徒关系各方面，有不少的模范表现。
    青年团在许多学校中起着骨干的作用。东北各著名大学及许多中、小学校里，团员们积极帮助改进学校教育，保证教育计划的完成。延安行知中学的团员，大多是品学兼优的好学生。许多学校的学生团员，除学好正课外，并利用座谈会、讲演会、壁报、展览、军事演习、打靶、行军、爬山、旅行、参观等课外活动作为辅助的学习形式以获得各方面的知识。在遵守校规，尊重教师，爱护同学方面，团员大都能起模范作用。
    青年团的组织领导与团员们的相互帮助，使青年们本身的许多困难问题，在平时不易解决的现在也得到了解决。在团的正确教育与健全组织生活下，青年们从旧社会中沾染的一些恶习，逐渐得到改造。有些地方并起了移风易俗的作用，使整个青年界的气象为之一新。由于这些实际事实的表现，青年团得到了教师们、家长们的好评和赞助。
    新民主主义青年团之所以得到上述的成绩，是由于它的有益于人民群众和青年自身的工作，而不是由于它的名义。少数地方青年团的干部没有认识建团的意义，而建团而建团，吸收团员不是基于本人的自觉自愿，形成干部包办，追求形式，贪图数量，不注意教育团员和培养积极分子与领导骨干，以致团的组织与工作走了样子。这些地方的青年团工作中的错误，在发现以后，已经纠正或正在纠正中。
    现在各地青年团正在各地党委的领导下，积极进行加强领导、统一机构、培养干部、健全和发展组织的工作。陕甘宁和东北都已召开了青年工作会议，成立了全区青年团的筹委会。华北、晋绥的青年工作会议，也即将举行。这些地区已从各方调集有青年工作经验的优秀干部来领导这一工作。东北、山东都开办了团干部训练班。训练全国青年团干部的学校，也已经由中共中央青委开办。
    随着解放战争的胜利开展，为了团结和教育广大青年群众，为了培养大批在思想上、政治上、文化上经过训练的革命后备军，为了更加发挥青年在革命战争和新民主主义建设事业中的积极作用，要求在一切具有适当条件的解放区中普遍建立与健全青年团的组织。这一工作，是全党的重要任务之一。
