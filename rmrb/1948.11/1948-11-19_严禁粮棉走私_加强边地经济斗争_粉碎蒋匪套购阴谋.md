　　Strictly Prohibit Grain and Cotton Smuggling
  　Strengthen Economic Struggle in Border Areas, Smash Chiang Kai-shek Bandit's Conspiracy to Procure Grain and Cotton
    [Report from This Newspaper] The Chiang Kai-shek bandits' conspiracy to procure grain and cotton from our area with counterfeit currency and cloth is actively underway. Some of our border areas have strengthened their economic struggle against the enemy. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits' procurement conspiracy is being carried out under the circumstances of their successive military defeats, the shrinking of their controlled areas, the extreme shortage of materials, and soaring prices, and therefore has the extremely vicious nature of a desperate struggle. According to the Tianjin "Minguo Daily" of October 19, "The Tianjin Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to enrich the city's grain supply, yesterday initiated the establishment of district people's food procurement and storage committees, composed of enthusiastic people from various districts, to procure three months' worth of food. On October 18, Tianjin Mayor Du Jianshi and the Social Affairs and Police Bureaus discussed the issue of exchanging cloth for grain in Tianjin and instructed the organization of exchange groups." On the 22nd, the Tianjin "Yishibao" reported: "The issue of exchanging cloth for grain in Tianjin has become concrete and will soon begin on a trial basis, starting no later than the 27th. The source of cloth will be, first, the cloth previously confiscated, which will be exchanged first. Second, the commercial cloth from various factories. The types of food grains are temporarily limited to rice, polished rice, corn, millet, sorghum, wheat, etc. The exchange locations in the city include the East Station, Xiyingmen, Shuiyingmen, Xiaowangzhuang, etc. Outside the city include Tongxian, Langfang, Yangcun, Shengfang, Guan, Zhuoxian, Jinghai, etc." Also, according to the Tianjin "Minguo Daily" on the 22nd: "The North China Grain Adjustment Committee's fundraising letter for purchasing grain has been sent to the Tianjin Major Money Bank and Bankers' Association. The funding target is six million yuan, half for Tianjin and half for Beiping." The Chiang Kai-shek's Ping, Tianjin, and Hebei tripartite council also suggested implementing southern purchasing and northern transportation to assist in purchasing grain from counties near Ping and Tianjin; the elimination of inspections for grain entering Ping and Tianjin suburbs, as well as encouraging grain merchants to purchase grain, protecting large landlords in the four villages to transport grain to Tianjin for storage, and canceling registration, etc. The Tianjin Chiang Kai-shek bandits also plan to absorb a large amount of cotton from our area. It is reported that cotton collection points have been set up in Yangliuqing, Beiping (with branches in Nanyuan, Dingxing, and Zhuoxian), and Tangshan. The provisional rate for Nanyuan's cotton collection is one bolt of cloth for eighty catties of seed cotton (at the current market price, each bolt of cloth can be exchanged for 120 catties of seed cotton in our area). This conspiracy of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, as well as the soaring prices in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, has already caused a serious smuggling situation in some of our border areas. In Gu'an, Baxian, Jinwu (parts of Xinxian and Tianjin Wuqing), Anci, Yongqing and other counties north of the Daqing River, some people, greedy for petty gains, are exchanging grain for foreign cloth. In the North Market of Shengfang, the number of peddlers from the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas is increasing daily. On October 25th, the number of stalls reached more than 1,000, half of whom were from Tianjin (and half of those were women), each bringing one to three bolts of foreign cloth, trying to exchange it for grain. Since October 19th, the enemy in Shengfang has been using trucks, carts, and small vehicles to transport grain to Tianjin every day.
    The above situations have aroused serious attention from the leadership, and closely combined with military and political struggle, vigorously launch an economic struggle against the enemy, organize the masses to quickly drive out enemy currency, strictly prohibit the smuggling of grain and cotton, and protect the interests of the masses.

　　严禁粮棉走私
  　加强边地经济斗争　粉碎蒋匪套购阴谋
    【本报讯】蒋匪以伪钞布匹等套购我区棉粮的阴谋正积极进行，我某些边沿区已加强了对敌经济斗争。蒋匪的套购阴谋，是在其军事着着失利，统治区日益缩小，物资奇缺，物价飞涨的情况下进行的，因此就带有垂死挣扎的极端狠毒的性质。据十月十九日天津民国日报载：“津市社会局为充裕本市粮食，昨日发起成立各区民食购储委员会，由各区热心人士组成。购储三个月食粮。十月十八日，津市长杜建时及社、警两局商讨办理津市以布易粮问题，并指示组织交换小组”。二十二日，天津益世报载：“津市以布易粮问题已趋具体，日内即将开始试办，至迟于二十七日开始交换。布匹来源，一为前所查封之布匹，决先交换。二为各厂商品布匹，食粮种类，暂以稻谷、大米、玉米、小米、红粮、小麦等为限。交换地点，本市计有东站，西营门、水营门、小王庄等处。市外计通县、廊房、扬村、胜芳、固安、涿县、静海等处。”又据天津民国日报二十二日载：“华北粮食调剂委员会集资购粮函，已送达天津巨钱银行两公会。资金目标为六百万元，平津各半”。蒋匪平、津、冀三参议会并建议实行南购北运，协助采购平津附近各县粮食；平、津郊区入境粮食一律取消检查，以及鼓励粮商采购粮食，保护四乡大地主运粮至天津存放，取消登记等。天津蒋匪并计划大量吸收我区棉花。据息：已在杨柳青、北平（分处设南苑、定兴、涿县）、唐山设收棉处。南苑收棉暂定为一匹布换八十斤籽棉（以目前市价计，每匹布到我区能换籽棉一百二十斤）。蒋匪这一阴谋，以及蒋区物价飞涨，已造成我某些边沿区走私的严重情况。大清河北固安、霸县、津武（新县、天津武清各一部）、安次、永清等县，有些人贪图小利，以粮换洋布。胜芳北市场，蒋区小贩日益增多，十月二十五日，出摊的达一千多人，其中天津人占半数（妇女又占半数），每人带一匹至三匹洋布，设法换去粮食。胜芳敌从十月十九日起，每天用汽车、大车、小车往天津运粮。
    以上这些情况，已引起领导上严重注意，紧紧结合军事政治斗争，大力开展对敌经济斗争，组织群众迅速驱逐敌币，严禁粮棉走私，保护群众利益。
