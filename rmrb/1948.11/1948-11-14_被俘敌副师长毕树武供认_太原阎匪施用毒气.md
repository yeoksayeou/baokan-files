Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Front, November 11th: Our People's Liberation Army on the Taiyuan front has obtained both testimonial and material evidence of the Yan troops in Taiyuan extensively using poison gas. According to Bi Shuwu, the captured commander of the Yan troops' southern Taiyuan bunker defense and deputy division commander of the Provisional 45th Division, in late July, when the People's Liberation Army approached Taiyuan city, the Yan troops frantically distributed poison gas to various units and important fortresses, secretly ordering its release "when necessary." The gas was distributed to the regimental level, with the regimental commander responsible for its safekeeping. Bi Shuwu's various fortress strongholds received a total of one hundred poison gas grenades. These were personally delivered to Bi's unit by Lang Chengqi, a lieutenant colonel cadet from the Yan troops' bunker defense commander Yang Yuzhen's officer corps. Lang Chengqi also conveyed the secret order in person, instructing each district's bunker defense commander and fortress commander to be responsible for the safekeeping and use, and not to distribute them further down or reveal them to lower-ranking officers and soldiers. This type of poison gas grenade was of the suffocating or sneezing type, resembling a regular hand grenade, with a handle on the top and a gray cylindrical tube on the bottom, 13 centimeters high and 5 centimeters in diameter. The grenades were covered with small holes and wrapped in yellow oiled paper. There were no other special markings or codes. Once released, the poison gas could last for five minutes to half an hour. When our army captured the brick well and North Camp strongholds, the enemy defenders in these two locations, along with this type of poison gas grenade that they had not yet used, were all captured by us.
