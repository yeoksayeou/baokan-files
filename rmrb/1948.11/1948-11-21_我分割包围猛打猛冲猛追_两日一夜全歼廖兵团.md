Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 15th. A front-line reporter reported on the great victory in Western Liaoning, detailing the annihilation of the Liao Yaoxiang Corps: As early as when the People's Liberation Army deployed to attack Jinzhou, Chiang Kai-shek personally flew to Shenyang to command, using his main force, the main New First Army, two divisions each from the New Sixth Army, another regiment, the entire New Third Army, two divisions from the Seventy-first Army, one division and another regiment from the Forty-ninth Army, the 195th Division of the original Fifty-second Army, and three cavalry brigades, forming the so-called Liao Yaoxiang Western Advance Corps, occupied Zhangwu, and attempted to cut off the rear supply line of the PLA attacking Jinzhou, threatening the PLA attacking Jinzhou, and coordinating with the defending enemy in Changchun to break through southward. However, the PLA quickly liberated Jinzhou and Changchun. Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly flew to Shenyang again to personally command, using the entire Liao Corps, as well as special forces such as heavy artillery and tanks, and the Third Brigade of the 207th Division transferred from Xinmin, a total of five armies, twelve divisions, and two regiments, advancing along the Beining Railway, attempting to reoccupy Jinzhou. At the same time, the Fifty-second Army moved south along the Zhongchang Railway, occupying Anshan, Haicheng, and Yingkou, attempting to secure a sea escape route.

A unit of the People's Liberation Army immediately carried out a strong blocking action north of Heishan and Dahushan. On the 24th and 25th, under the cover of the air force and heavy artillery, the enemy used its Seventy-first Army, New First Army, New Sixth Army, and the Third Brigade of the 207th Division to launch repeated fierce attacks on our positions, but were all repelled. Our victorious troops who had attacked Jinzhou, regardless of post-war fatigue, quickly turned east from the night of the 20th and arrived at the assembly positions one after another. The enemy's attempt to break through on the front failed, so they attempted to take the route to Taian and Panshan to escape to Yingkou. On the 25th, the 53rd Provisional Division of the New First Army, which was still on the east bank of the Liao River, crossed the Liao River westward to attack us in concert, attempting to meet the 105th Division of the Forty-ninth Army and the New Sixth Army ahead of the Liao Corps, which were advancing in the direction of Panshan. But as soon as they encountered our army, the enemy fled back in panic. At this time, the enemy realized that they were facing the main force of our army. Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly flew to Shenyang again to command, vainly attempting to flee eastward back to Xinmin. Unexpectedly, our main force in the north, also with a forced march of more than 200 li in one day and one night, hurried forward to cut off the enemy's retreat.

Our eastern and western armies gradually tightened the encirclement, compressing the enemy entirely into a narrow area of more than 80 li, west of the Raoyang River, east of Dahushan, south of Wuliangdian, and north of Taian. At 4:00 am on the 26th, a large-scale encirclement and annihilation battle began. In the east, our army first gave a head-on blow to the enemy fleeing eastward, inflicting great casualties. In the west, our blocking troops and the main force of our army returning from Jinzhou launched a large-scale attack at the same time. First, in the Hujia Wopeng area northeast of Heishan, the main force deployment of the Liao Corps, which was huddled there, was disrupted, and its corps headquarters was eliminated in one fell swoop. The enemy fled east and west, with no way to go, mixed into a团, and by the evening of the 26th, it had already collapsed. Our army then quickly divided and encircled them, followed by the three fierce tactics of fierce attack, fierce charge, and fierce pursuit, annihilating the enemy one by one. The battle lasted two days and one night. By the morning of the 28th, our army had completely and cleanly annihilated the Liao Yaoxiang Corps, which was fully mechanized and equipped with a large number of heavy artillery, killing and capturing more than 100,000 enemies, and achieved a huge victory of decisive significance for the complete annihilation of the Northeast Chiang bandits and the liberation of the entire Northeast.

　　我分割包围猛打猛冲猛追
  　两日一夜全歼廖兵团
    【新华社东北前线十五日电】前线记者报导辽西大捷全歼廖耀湘兵团经过称：早在解放军部署进攻锦州之时，蒋介石即亲自飞沈指挥、以其主力之主力新一军、新六军各两个师、另一个团及新三军全部、七十一军之两个师、四十九军一个师另一个团、原五十二军之一九五师与三个骑兵旅，组成所谓廖耀湘西进兵团，自侵占彰武，妄想截断攻锦解放军后方补给线，威胁进攻锦州之解放军，策应长春守敌南向突围。但解放军迅即解放锦州、长春，蒋介石慌忙再度飞沈，亲自指挥，以廖兵团全部及重炮、战车等特种部队，及由新民增调来之整二零七师第三旅，共五个军十二个师另两个团兵力，沿北宁路前进，企图重占锦州。同时，以五十二军沿中长路南下，进占鞍山、海城、营口，企图取得海上逃路。
    解放军一部当即于黑山、打虎山以北，进行坚强阻击。二十四、二十五两日，敌在空军、重炮掩护之下，以其七十一军、新一军、新六军，整二零七师第三旅，向我阵地轮番猛攻，均被击退。而我攻锦胜利之师，不顾战后疲劳，于二十日夜起即迅速东转，先后到达集结位置。敌正面突窜企图不逞，乃图取道台安、盘山窜往营口。二十五日，以其尚在辽河东岸之新一军暂五十三师西渡辽河，向我合击，图接应廖兵团先头之四十九军一零五师及新六军向盘山方向前进。但一与我军遭遇，敌即仓皇回窜。此时，敌始发现已面临我军主力，蒋介石又仓皇亲飞沈阳指挥，妄图向东回窜新民，不意我北面主力部队，亦以一日一夜二百余里之强行军，兼程急进，截断了敌之归路。
    我东西大军逐渐紧缩包围。将敌全部压缩于饶阳河以西、打虎山以东、无梁店以南、台安以北、纵横八十余里之狭小地区内，于二十六日四时起开始了大规模的围歼战。东面我军首即迎头痛击东窜之敌，予敌极大杀伤，西面我阻击部队及锦州回师之我主力部队，同时大举出击。首于黑山东北胡家窝棚地区将猬集于此之廖兵团主力部署打乱，一举消灭其兵团司令部。敌东逃西窜，走头无路，混成一团，迄二十六日晚，即已溃不成军。我军则迅速予以分割包围，继以猛打、猛冲、猛追之三猛战术，将敌各个歼灭。战斗历时两日一夜，至二十八日晨，我军即将敌全部机械化配有多数重炮装备之廖耀湘兵团彻底、干净消灭，毙俘敌十万余众，取得了对全歼东北蒋匪解放全东北有决定意义的巨大胜利。
