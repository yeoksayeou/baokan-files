　　Anyang Under a Victorious Situation
    As the People's Liberation Army recovered major cities such as Jinan, Changchun, Kaifeng, Shenyang, and Zhengzhou during the Autumn Offensive and continued to expand its victorious offensive, our cadres, soldiers, and civilians in Yexian County extensively launched a political offensive. We convened widespread meetings for cadres, the masses, families of puppet personnel, and village heads, utilizing various occasions and methods: large and small meetings, markets, public blackboards, and radio stations for propaganda, and printed a large number of propaganda materials, launching a life-saving movement of disintegrating the enemy and puppet forces by having their relatives call out to them, recite books, and send letters. Under such circumstances, the enemy and diehards in Anyang were extremely panicked, while the masses were exceptionally excited.
    "Zhengzhou has been recovered!" "Kaifeng has been recovered!" The news was spreading everywhere, with reports of victories being disseminated like snowflakes in the countryside. Encouraged by the victories, the masses unanimously said, "We have finally reached the end; we will soon have a peaceful life." As soon as cadres and militiamen arrived in a village, men and women, young and old, would automatically gather and surround the comrades, saying, "Comrades, tell us about the victories."
    When we went to Xin'anji in the enemy-controlled area to carry out propaganda during the market, those selling goods stopped selling, and those buying stopped buying, all listening to us talk about the victories. Some said, "With the capture of Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, Anyang is finished!" An old man from the Fourth District said, "These days, I am working with even greater enthusiasm because I am so happy. The masses are not giving grain or money to the enemy, and no one is using the puppet 'Gold Yuan Certificates'." A sesame cake buyer asked, "How much does a sesame cake cost?" The seller said, "What kind of money?" "Gold Yuan Certificates." "I don't sell for that." "PLA currency." "One hundred yuan for one." Because the masses did not use puppet currency, the enemy issued a notice saying, "Anyone who does not use 'legal tender' will be handed over to military and police organs for legal action," but it was to no avail.
    A bad element in the Sixth District, relying on the enemy's power, extorted two piculs of wheat from a middle peasant, Lu Chengxin, in Popo Village. After hearing about the victory, Lu said, "The day to take revenge has come," and told our staff, "When I go to the city, I will lead the way to catch that bad element, and I will surely get a box cannon." The masses in Xin'anji reported to us that "XX has the enemy's grain." We sent someone to check, and there were indeed more than 7,000 catties of grain.
    Upon hearing about the victory, families of puppet personnel worried that their sons and husbands would be transported by plane to the south of the Yellow River, so they went to the city in groups, wearing civilian clothes, to call for them. Some said to the People's Liberation Army, "Attack Zhangde quickly, and our people will return as soon as you do." The masses also automatically launched a movement to disintegrate the enemy and puppet forces, some sending letters and some transmitting messages. Sun Qiyuan's wife, a militiaman from the Sixth District, mobilized a puppet soldier, XXX, in a village, saying, "Don't run away. The militiamen say that it doesn't matter if you didn't do bad things at home. If you don't believe it, talk to them, and you're guaranteed to be fine."
    Puppet village heads, seeing that the enemy was about to collapse, no longer handed over money or grain to the enemy. Some village heads whom I could not summon in the past now often come to me voluntarily. The public grain that had not been completed in the past has now been completed today. They are all privately discussing, "Let's perform meritorious service quickly so that we can reduce our sins in the future." The puppet township head also dared not be bad. Once, the township office set off for Mu Village because the village head did not pay the grain and money. The township captain asked the township head to come up with an idea to deal with it. The township head said, "I don't care" (meaning I don't want to offend anyone). The township captain said, "If you don't offend anyone, how will I get a good outcome?" He immediately told the township soldiers, "Let him go back." The Mu Village head was released. The Yedong Township head also gave us public grain. Lu Tingjun, who had worked as a teacher under Wang Ziquan, also went home and quit his job when he saw that the enemy's situation was over.
    Under the influence of our victory and political offensive, the Anyang enemy was extremely panicked. The enemy's 117th Regiment and 116th Regiment were both afraid of being the last to leave and suffering losses, so they were competing to be the first to leave. The enemy had no choice but to let one battalion leave, then another, and stipulated that family members of cadres above the regimental level could take the plane for free, while those below had to pay 150 White Ocean dollars per person. Those with money left, while the wives and children without money had to shave their heads, put on military uniforms, and carry rifles and bullets, pretending to be soldiers on the plane. The driver discovered a battalion commander's wife on the plane. The battalion commander begged in every possible way, but the driver said, "What are you bringing her for? There are plenty in Xuzhou!" and pushed her down. She was pushed down a second time after disguising herself as a soldier. A company commander's wife got on the plane with two children, only paying for one person. When she was checked, the woman had to throw one child off the plane, crying, and got on the plane and left. A family member disguised as a soldier put a child in a basket, wrapped tightly in a quilt, fearing being discovered. As a result, when they looked at the child on the plane, the child's eyes were wide open and he was dead.
    The bandits were also very afraid and were all approaching the city gates. The Independent Battalion of the Supervisory District, which was stationed in Jianghetun, withdrew to Shiliupu and dared not take off their backpacks at night when sleeping.
    The soldiers were generally discussing, "The Eighth Route Army is coming soon, we want to surrender our guns!" Some were saying to each other, "It doesn't matter if the Eighth Route Army opens up Zhangde, we won't lack millet to eat," and they were fleeing in droves. In the past five or six days, according to statistics from fourteen villages in the Fourth District, seventeen people had returned. Li Wansan, Wang Ziquan's adjutant (who had been with Wang Ziquan for eight or nine years), told his friend before returning, "I'm going back," and said, "It's not good to go back without a gun." He borrowed a Mauser pistol from his friend (a company commander) and returned. His friend said, "Go back. If there's nothing wrong, send a letter, and we'll go back too." The bandit leader Guo Qing often told his subordinates, "Don't give me away as a gift" (meaning he was afraid that the soldiers would hand him over to the Eighth Route Army or kill him).
    One day, an incendiary bomb exploded at the airport, setting all the bullets and bombs at the airport on fire. The explosions kept going on and on. The enemy living in Bo'ai Village thought that our army had attacked the city and rushed back, not caring about the grain and supplies they had left behind. The masses also thought that the Eighth Route Army had entered the city, saying, "This time, the dogs are finished." The masses in the surrounding villages all went to Bo'ai to rob the grain from the enemy's warehouse. At this time, our army also arrived and distributed more than 200 piculs of grain to the masses.

　　胜利形势下的安阳
    人民解放军秋季攻势收复济南、长春、开封、沈阳、郑州等大城市，继续扩张胜利攻势的时候，我邺县党政军民干部，深入广泛的开展了政治攻势。普遍分别召开干部、群众、伪属、保长会议，利用各种场合，各种方式：大会小会，集市饭市，大众黑板、广播台进行宣传，并印发大量宣传品，开展了瓦解敌伪索夫叫子背书带信的救命运动。在这样的情况下，使安阳敌顽万分恐慌，群众则异常兴奋。
    “收复郑州了”、“收复开封了”，到处在嚷嚷着，宣传品捷报雪片似的在农村传播着。在胜利的鼓舞下，群众异口同声的说：“可算熬到头了，马上就要过安生时光。”干部民兵一到村，男男女女、老老少少就自动集合将同志们团拢起来，说：“同志，给说说胜利。”
    我们到敌控制区的辛安集，利用集市进行宣传，卖东西的不卖了，买的也不买了，听我们讲胜利。有的说：“打了开封、郑州，安阳就完蛋啦！”四区一个老乡说：“这几天高兴的作活的劲头更大了。群众都不给敌人上粮上款了，伪金圆券也没人用了。”一个买烧饼的问：“一个烧饼多少钱？”卖烧饼的说：“啥票”？“金圆券”，“不卖”；“八路票”，“一百元一个”。因为群众不用伪币，敌人就出了一张布告说：“谁不用‘法币’，就扭送军警机关法办”，但也无济于事。
    六区一个坏蛋，依仗敌人势力，讹去坡里村中农鲁成信两石麦子，鲁听到胜利后，说：“这可到报仇的日子了”，并和我工作人员说：“哪天进城我带路，捉住那个坏蛋，准能得支盒子枪。”辛安集群众向我报告说：“××存有敌人的粮食”，我派人去看，果然有七千余斤粮食。
    伪属们听到胜利，担心自己的儿子丈夫被飞机运到黄河南，都成群结队的拿了便衣去城内叫，有的对解放军说：“你们快打彰德吧，一打俺的人就回来了”。群众也自动展开了瓦解敌伪运动，有的捎书，有的传信。六区民兵孙其元的妻，动员个村伪军×××说：“你不要跑了，听民兵说，在家不做坏事不要紧，若不信你和他们说谈谈，保险没事”。
    伪保长看到敌人快完蛋，也不给敌人交款交粮了。过去有些保长我召集不到，现在经常自动来找，没有完成的公粮，今天也都完成了，他们都互相私议着，“快立功吧，将来能减轻咱们的罪过。”伪乡长也不敢坏了，一次乡公所出发到慕村，因保长不上粮款，扣到乡公所，乡队长让乡长出主意处理，乡长说：“我不管”（意思是我不惹人了）；乡队长说：“你不惹人，我就不知道落个好？”马上告给乡丁说：“把他放回去吧”，慕村保长被放回来了。邺东乡保长也给我们上了公粮。过去在王自全部当过先生的路廷俊，看到敌人大势已去，也回家不干了。
    在我胜利与政治攻势影响下，安阳敌人极为恐慌。敌一一七团、一一六团谁也怕走的迟了吃了亏，争着先走；敌人无法，只好你走一营，他走一营，并规定团长以上干部家属坐飞机不出钱，以下出钱，运一个人出白洋一百五十元，有钱的走了，没钱的家属妇女，只好剃光头发，穿上军服，背上步枪和子弹装做士兵坐飞机。一个营长太太坐飞机被驾驶员发觉，营长百般哀求，驾驶员说：“带他干啥，到徐州多着哩！”被推了下来。第二次装做士兵又被推下。一个连长太太上飞机，带着两个小孩，只出了一个人的白洋，被检查出，该女人只得将一个小孩扔到飞机下，哭着上了飞机走了。一个家属化装成战士，将一个孩子放到篮子里，用被子裹的紧紧的，生怕被发觉，结果到飞机上一看，小孩已白瞪着两眼死了。
    土匪也很害怕，都向城关靠拢，住江河屯的督导区独立营，撤到十里铺，黑夜睡觉不敢解背包。
    当兵的则普遍的议论着：“八路军快来吧，我们要缴枪的呀！”有的互相说着：“八路军打开彰德，也不缺咱的小米吃”，并纷纷逃亡。近五六天，据四区十四个村的统计，即跑回十七人。王部副官李万三（跟王自全八九年）回来前和他的朋友说：“我要回去了”，并说：“回去没有枪多不好看”，借了他朋友（连长）一支二把盒子回来了，他朋友说：“你回去吧，如没有事给来信，我们也回去”。土匪头子郭清经常和他下面的人说：“你们可不要把我送了礼（意思是怕当兵的把他交给八路军或打死）。”
    一天，在飞机场爆炸了一个燃烧弹，将机场的子弹、炸弹全燃着了，＠＠拍拍响个不停，住博爱村的敌人，当是我军攻进了城，赶快往回拉，丢下的粮食东西也不管了。群众也当八路军进了城，说：“这一回狗日们可完啦”。周围村庄群众都到博爱抢敌人仓库里的粮食，这时我军也赶到，将二百多石粮食全部分给了群众。（邺县联合办公室）
