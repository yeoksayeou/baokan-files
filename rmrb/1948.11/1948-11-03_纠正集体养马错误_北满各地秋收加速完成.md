Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th: Agricultural socialist tendencies in handling the issue of carts and horses occurred seriously in several areas of Northern Manchuria. In the past land reform, phenomena such as collective division of large carts and collective horse-raising occurred, leading to a large reduction in the number of carts and horses in rural areas. After these deviations were discovered, they were corrected before the autumn harvest, enabling the rapid completion of the autumn harvest operations.

During the land reform, some areas stipulated that the large carts confiscated from landlords or requisitioned from surplus property of old-style rich peasants should be collectively divided and used by farmers, or the ownership of the carts was not determined for a long time, resulting in the damage of many vehicles. For example, in Mingde Village, Wujimi District, Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province, seven families shared one cart. Everyone抢 was rushing to use it when needed, but no one was in charge after use, resulting in the cart being ruined by the rain. In Tianfeng Village, Bin County, the ownership of fourteen iron carts was not determined, and five had already been damaged. Because Democratic Village borrowed private cars without compensation, the owners suffered losses. At the same time, it was stipulated that those with cars should bear the burden of providing public cars, while those without cars would not bear the burden, so the masses were unwilling to add cars, and the number of cars was greatly reduced. The whole village has 400 hectares of land, but only six carts. Calculating one cart for 20 hectares of crops, six carts can only carry 120 hectares. Shuanghe District, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, stipulates that no matter whose cart it is, it should be placed in the group for collective use. All eleven carts in Qian Yangjiatun were completely damaged and left unattended. Zhang Xuezhong, a hired peasant in Liujia Village, bought a cart when delivering fertilizer in the spring, but it was also assigned to the group for collective use, which affected those who originally wanted to buy a car and were unwilling to buy it again.

Regarding horses, some areas also had forced organization, collective feeding, and collective use, or unreasonable horse labor prices during the spring plowing. Farmers were also worried about buying horses, which led to a decrease in the number of horses. For example, in Bayan County, Songjiang Province, during the summer hoeing, three-fifths of the villages and settlements still collectively fed horses, generally with a ox-plow team as a unit. An ox-plow team has twelve horses, including about sixteen households, and everyone elects a horse feeder, whose land is planted by the whole team. The horse's forage is evenly distributed according to land area or population, and households with and without horses share the forage equally. Some county and district cadres emphasized that this method has many benefits. But the farmers are very dissatisfied. Tian Qinglei, an old man in Chaoyang Village, was afraid that collective feeding would ruin his horse, but he was afraid that everyone would "reflect" him if he did not collectively feed, so he had to provide forage to the team for free, and still lead the horse back to feed it himself. Other horse owners who took their horses out for collective feeding were not at ease with their horses and went to see them every day. Some couldn't sleep and got up in the middle of the night to see them. On the first day of collective horse feeding in Qiong Sanliantun, ten farmers ran to the trough to watch their horses, afraid that their horses would suffer, and no one was willing to leave. Shi Gui, a poor peasant in Anju Village, has 1.5 hectares of land and raises one horse. If he feeds it himself, in addition to planting his own land, he can also捎 take care of 3.5 hectares of ox-plow. The ox-plow money is calculated at one stone of grain per hectare of land, which can bring in 3.5 stones of grain. Two stones of grain are used to exchange for grass, and 1.5 stones of grain are used as feed, so there is no need to prepare forage separately. After collective feeding, not only can he not get ox-plow money, but he has to subsidize forage separately. In Gaoxian, Lincheng and other districts of Wangkui County, Heilongjiang Province, the phenomenon of collective horse feeding was also quite serious. In this way, farmers mistakenly believed that this was the first step of "equalizing property." For example, farmers in a village in Mulan County said: "This year, we will feed horses collectively, next year we will eat collectively, and the year after that, we will all use the same spoon in one pot." In District 1 of Zhaozhou County, Nenjiang Province, due to unreasonable horse labor prices, horse-raising households were in low spirits, and the phenomenon of strong horses being exchanged for weak horses and weak horses being exchanged for money was very common. Due to the above reasons, many horses in various places were thin, weak, sick, and dead.

If these wrong practices are not corrected, they will inevitably seriously affect this year's autumn harvest. Therefore, after discovering these deviations, various localities resolutely corrected them. In preparation for the autumn harvest, they all announced the determination of cart ownership and divided the undivided large carts. In order to encourage the purchase of cars, Bin County, Songjiang Province, stipulated: (1) Public cars should be sold to private individuals by bidding; (2) Borrowing cars must be paid for, so that car owners can profit; (3) Everyone should bear the burden of public cars. At the same time, in order to solve the problem of the shortage of cars, it was stipulated that during the autumn harvest, horses should be changed but not cars, and they should be transported day and night. When exchanging labor to pull crops to the threshing floor, it must be guaranteed that horse-raising households will not suffer losses. Regarding horses, first of all, cadres should realize that forced collective horse feeding is not only an infringement of private ownership, but is also harmful to the development of production under the current level of farmers' awareness, and it seriously hits the poor and middle peasants, who already have horses and account for the vast majority of the rural population, and only benefits a few lazy loafers and swindlers. Because the number of horses in rural areas after the land reform is very different from before the land reform, the current horses belong to the middle and poor peasants, and the landless are landlords, some old-style rich peasants, and loafers. The method of collective horse feeding and collective use makes it impossible for the vast majority of the already liberated poor and hired peasants to obtain benefits, and it also fosters the dependence of loafers and lazybones, who say: "Anyway, it is not allowed to abandon the land now (meaning that the government does not allow wasteland), you have to serve me." They don't give horse grass or horse feed, and they just persevere. When the Bayan County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Songjiang Province corrected the deviation, it clearly announced: (1) Collective horse feeding is not allowed; (2) Exchange of labor and ox-plow teams must be of equal value, and the regulations on ox-plow prices must be based on the principle of rewarding horse-raising on the one hand and taking care of horse-less households being able to prosper and become rich on the other hand. Wangkui County, Heilongjiang Province, determined the wages of horses so that horse-raising households could profit. The strength and weakness of horses are also graded. The government will reward those who raise horses well.

After the reasonable solution of the cart and horse problem, the farmers dispelled their worries and bought carts and horses one after another. After Bayan County, Songjiang Province, disbanded collective horse feeding, the production enthusiasm of farmers throughout the county increased sharply. Within half a month, Fuyu District exchanged firewood for fifteen horses and eight carts. After Wang Jian of Xinfacun pulled his horse back, he added 400,000 yuan to exchange for a fat horse. Middle peasant Wang Fengxin bought a set of plows and three animals. Shulan District of Shulan County, Jilin Province, had 256 cars, and after determining the ownership of the cars, it has increased to 363 cars. In order to protect horses and ensure the autumn harvest, District 10 of Nehe County, Nenjiang Province, built more than 480 horse sheds in the district.

In this way, due to the reasonable solution of the cart and horse problem, the pulling and threshing intensity in the autumn harvest in the North Manchuria region has been greatly improved, thus greatly accelerating the completion of the autumn harvest.

    纠正集体养马错误
    北满各地秋收加速完成
    【新华社东北二十七日电】处理车马问题上的农业社会主义倾向，曾严重地发生于北满若干地区。这些地区在过去土地改革中曾发生伙分大车和集体养马等现象，致农村中车马大量减少。这些偏向经发现后，在秋收前已经纠正，使秋收拉打得以迅速完成。
    在土地改革中，由于部分地区规定把没收地主或征收旧式富农多余财产所得来的大车由农民伙分伙用，或者迟迟未确定车权，因此损坏车辆不少。如松江省尚志县乌吉密区明德村七家分一台车，用时大家抢着用，用后则无人管，结果让雨把车子淋坏。宾县天丰村十四台铁车未确定车权，已经坏了五台。民主村因无代价借用私车，使车主吃亏，同时规定有车的负担出公车，无车的则不负担，以致群众都不愿添车，车子大为减少。全村有四百垧地，但只有六台车，以一台车拉廿垧庄稼计，六台车只能拉一百二十垧。黑龙江省绥化县双河区规定不论谁的大车都搁在小组伙用。前杨家屯十一辆大车全用坏了，扔在一旁无人管。浏家村雇农张学忠在春天送粪时买了一辆车，也被分到小组伙用，影响了本来要买车的人都不愿再买。
    关于马匹，春耕时部分地区也有强迫编组，集体喂，大家用，或马工价定得不合理的现象。农民对买马也有顾虑，马匹因之减少。如松江省巴彦县在夏锄时还有五分之三的村屯集体喂马，一般是以一个牛犋组为单位集体喂，全组用。一个牛犋有十二匹马，包括十六户左右的人家，由大家选出一个喂马的，他的地由全组代种。马的草料按地亩或人口均摊，有马户和无马户同样照摊草料。有某此县区干部强调这个办法有许多好处。但是农民很不满。朝阳村田庆雷老头怕集体喂把他的马喂坏，不集体喂又怕大家“反映”他，只好白给组上出草料，马仍牵回去自己喂。其他把马拿出集体喂的马主，对自己的马也不放心，天天去看。有的睡不着觉，半夜起来去看。穷三联屯在集体喂马的第一天，十户农民都跑到马槽边瞅着自己的马，怕自己的马吃亏，谁也不肯走开。安居村贫农石桂有一垧半地，养一匹马。自己喂，除种自己的地外，还能捎三垧半牛犋，牛犋钱以一垧地一石粮计，可收入三石五斗粮，用两石粮换草，一石五斗粮作料，就用不着自己另备草料。集体喂后，不但得不到牛犋钱，反得另贴草料。黑龙江省望奎县高贤，临城等区，集体喂马现象也相当严重。这样，使农民误认为这就是“均产”的第一步。如木兰县一个村的农民就说：“今年集体喂马，明年集体吃饭，后年就一个锅里耍杓子了。”嫩江省肇州县一区由于马工价不合理，养马户情绪低落，强马换成弱马，弱马换成钱的现象很普遍。由于上述原因，各地马瘦、弱、病、死的很多。
    这些错误作法如不加以纠正，势必严重影响今年秋收。故各地在发现这些偏向后，即予坚决纠正。在准备秋收中，都宣布确定车权，把未分的大车分定。松江省宾县为了鼓励买车，规定：（一）公车用投标方法卖与私人；（二）借车一定要有代价，要使车主有利可图；（三）出公车由大家负担。同时，为了解决车少问题，规定在秋收中换马不换车，日夜拉运。换工拉庄稼打场时，要保证有马户不吃亏。马匹方面，首先使干部认识强迫集体喂马不单是侵犯了私有权，在目前农民的觉悟程度下对发展生产有害，而且严重地打击了现在已经有了马匹的占农村人口绝大多数的贫雇中农，只便宜了少数懒蛋二流子和耍尖头的人。因为土地改革后农村中有马的已和土改前大不相同，目前有马的是中贫雇农，无马的是地主、部分旧式富农和二流子。集体喂马大伙使用的办法，使大多数已翻身的贫雇农得不到利益，又助长了二流子懒蛋的依赖思想，这些人说：“反正现在不许可扔地（即政府不许荒地之意），你们得给我侍弄上。”他们马草马料都不给，硬挺着。松江省巴彦县中共县委在纠正偏向时明确宣布：（一）不准强迫集体喂马；（二）换工农犋必须等价交换，牛犋价的规定，必须以一方面奖励养马，另一方面又照顾无马户能发财致富为原则。黑龙江省望奎县确定马的工资，使养马户有利。马强马弱也规定等级。马养得好的政府予以奖励。
    车马问题合理解决后，农民打消了顾虑，纷纷添买车马。松江省巴彦县解散集体喂马，全县农民生产情绪即趋高涨。富裕区半月内用柴草换回马十五匹、车八辆。新发村王检把马拉回后，即添了四十万元换了一匹肥马。中农王风新置一副犁仗、三头牲口。吉林省舒兰县舒兰区有车二百五十六台，确定车权后已增至三百六十三台。嫩江省讷河县十区为爱护马匹保证秋收，全区修盖马棚四百八十多个。
    这样，由于车马问题的合理解决，北满地区秋收中的拉打强度大大提高，因而大大加速了秋收的完成。
