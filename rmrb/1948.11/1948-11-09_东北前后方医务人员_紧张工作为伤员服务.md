Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 6th: The Northeast People's Liberation Army's autumn offensive has put medical personnel on the front and rear lines in the Northeast into a state of intense activity. Tens of thousands of medical personnel who have undergone rigorous technical and political training have been assigned to various medical departments to serve. In order to solve the treatment and accommodation problems of the wounded and sick, distribution stations and reception stations have been set up along the thousands of miles of transportation lines between the front and rear. There are special sanitary trains and medical personnel to escort the wounded. The hygiene departments of the front-line troops have stipulated responsibilities at all levels to achieve the goal of "a long supply line but continuous treatment." Residents along the transportation lines and where the hospitals are located have voluntarily organized comfort teams to conduct enthusiastic visits. Some places have organized blood donation teams to provide blood transfusions to the wounded. Hospital staff personally participate in the construction and repair of wards. At the start of the autumn offensive, the capacity of the rear hospitals alone was four times higher than during the winter offensive last year. The medicines and equipment in various hospitals have been improved compared to before, which is sufficient to guarantee and even exceed the needs of the planned accommodation tasks. Some personnel from a certain military station hospital on the eastern front followed the army to carry out rescue work, entering and exiting the hail of bullets to complete their rescue missions. Since the hygiene department's hospitals on this line improved their medical style, their medical technology has significantly improved, reducing the suffering of the wounded and greatly reducing the disability rate. A certain hospital on the western front implemented new therapies, and emergency surgery can be completed within a week of the wounded's admission. The wounded in the rear hospitals have rich nutrition, averaging five to six times more than ordinary rear personnel, and more than ten times more for the seriously wounded. There is also ample preparation of cotton clothing and quilts needed by the wounded. A certain hospital in the Songjiang Military Region ensures that each wounded and sick person has five meals a day, with nutrition reaching 2,957 calories, supplemented by nutritious medicines, which is enough to maintain normal calories.

　　东北前后方医务人员
  　紧张工作为伤员服务
    【新华社哈尔滨六日电】东北人民解放军的秋季攻势使东北前后方医务人员进入紧张的活动。经过严格技术及政治训练的数万个医务人员，已先后分配到各医务部门服务。为解决伤病员的治疗及食宿问题，前后方数千里的转运线上均设有分配站及招待站。有专门卫生列车及医务人员护送伤员的转运。前方各部队卫生机关规定各级专责，以达到“兵站线长而治疗不断”的目的。在转运线上及医院驻地，居民自动组织慰问队热烈进行慰问。有些地方组织了输血队给伤员输血。各医院工作人员亲自动手参加建造及修理病房。秋季攻势开始时，仅后方医院的收容能力较去年冬季攻势时提高四倍。各医院的医药、器材较前都有改善，足以保证甚至超过预定收容任务的需要。东线某兵站医院部分人员，随军进行救护工作，出入枪林弹雨完成抢救任务。该线卫生部所属各医院自改进医疗作风后，医疗技术显著提高，使伤员减少痛苦。并使残废率大为降低。西线某医院实行新疗法，突击手术能做到伤员入院后一周内即可完成。后方各医院伤员营养丰富，平均超过普通后方人员的五、六倍，重伤者超过十倍。伤员所必需的棉衣、棉被也有充分准备。松江军区某医院，保证每个伤病员每天五餐，营养达二千九百五十七卡罗里，再加以富有营养的药品，足以维持正常热量。
