　　[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The North China People's Government issued instructions on winter production on November 10th. The original text is as follows: To all Administrative Offices and Special Commissioners' Offices of the County Governments:
    Winter production has been arranged in all areas. The following points are now highlighted. It is hoped that all regions will pay attention to studying and implementing them:
    I. Continue to implement winter plowing, "the plow does not stop when the ground freezes," to ensure that autumn land is plowed once. Advocate for winter fertilizer accumulation, using various methods to increase fertilizer. In addition to mobilizing smoking fallow land and padding stables, it can be linked to oil pressing to increase oil cake production. For those who cannot afford to buy it, loans can be planned to help.
    II. Continue to rectify village cooperatives, county and district joint cooperatives, and advancing cooperatives, actively organizing farmers' production, and even more actively absorb their products at prices slightly higher than the market price, and supply their agricultural tools and consumables at prices slightly lower than the market price. It must be understood that this is the most effective way to help farmers support production. In areas with a foundation, organize small-scale cooperation and mutual assistance under the principle of equivalence and voluntariness, and further organize winter production. Sideline occupations should be developed according to local conditions. Seize the repair, manufacture, and supplement of agricultural tools, and support the iron and wood industries. Special attention should be paid to guiding the sideline production of the masses in disaster areas. Mountainous areas can implement mountain enclosure hunting to eliminate harm to the people. Strictly prohibit the destruction of forests and trees, burning charcoal, burning bituminous coal, stripping bark (such as birch bark and linden bark), burning mountains, and other matters, which must be strictly controlled or prohibited.
    III. The central issue of improving agricultural production by an inch is to increase labor (mainly animal power), build water conservancy, increase fertilizer, and prevent and control diseases and insect pests. In order to do a good job in next year's production work, do as much as possible of the work that can be prepared this winter, which will lay a victorious foundation for next year's production. Therefore: (1) Adjust war service to save labor, summarize the experience of women's production, and widely publicize, advocate and reward the breeding of livestock, and solve the specific difficulties of the masses in raising livestock. (2) Investigate and study the situation of water channels, waterwheels, and wells, and discuss with farmers plans and methods for repairing old channels, old wells, old waterwheels, and opening channels, digging wells, and increasing waterwheels, as part of the preparation for handling agricultural loans. (3) Due to the development of the war situation, the demand for cotton has increased. Cotton-producing areas should study ways to increase cotton production, understand the difficulties of farmers in producing cotton (the contradiction between planting wheat and planting cotton), plan the number of cotton plants for next year in advance, and solve the difficulties (such as the variety and quantity of cotton seeds). (4) For the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, attention should be paid to the propaganda and organization of seed selection. In addition to organizing autumn and winter plowing, insecticides should be planned to be used for insect pests. (5) Mobilize the masses to accumulate coal and firewood in winter, and set up coal stations in necessary areas. Mountain firewood collection should be combined with forest protection. All the above work should be prepared as much as possible in winter.
    IV. Use the slack season and winter to adopt various lively forms, such as sunbathing and holding investigation meetings, to discuss production issues with farmers, in order to absorb and promote good farming methods, promote hard work to get rich, and understand the practical difficulties of farmers in production, in order to study solutions, and publicize the progressive technologies that farmers can implement. This is the best way to lead production.
    V. In addition to general guidance, it is hoped that more typical experiences will be studied, whether it is the organization of sideline production, fertilizer accumulation experience, winter plowing, or symposium experience. Studying more typical experiences can improve leadership.
    In addition, please report to us the number and experience of wheat and autumn-plowed land this year. (No separate document will be issued)

　　华北人民政府关于冬季生产的指示
    【本报特讯】华北人民政府于十一月十日发出关于冬季生产的指示。原文如下：各行署并各专署县府：
    冬季生产各地均有布置，兹指出以下数事，希各区注意研究执行：
    一、继续贯彻冬耕，“地不冻犁不停”，保证秋地普耕一遍。提倡冬季积肥，用各种办法增加肥料，除发动熏荒垫厩外，可与榨油相联系，增产油饼，群众买不起的，可计划用一部贷款帮助。
    二、继续整顿村合作社、县区联社、推进社，积极组织农民生产，更要积极以稍高于市价的价格，吸收其生产品，以稍低于市价的价格供给其农具及消耗品，必须了解，这是帮助农民扶植生产的最有效的办法，在有基础的地区，在等价与自愿的原则下，组织小型合作互助，进一步有组织的开展冬季生产，副业要因地制宜，加以发展，抓紧农具的修理制造与补充，扶植铁工业与木工业，要特别注意灾区群众副业生产的指导。山区可实行围山打猎，为民除害，严禁破毁林木，烧木炭、烧烟煤、剥树皮（如桦皮椴皮等）烧山等事，必须严格管制或禁止。
    三、农业生产提高一寸的中心问题，是增加劳动力（主要是畜力），兴办水利，增加肥料，防除病虫害等项，为了把明年的生产工作办好，凡是今年冬季能够准备的工作，尽可能做好，就会为明年的生产打下一个胜利的基础，因此：（一）调整战勤以节省劳动力，总结妇女生产的经验，并广泛宣传，提倡并奖励繁殖牲畜，解决群众养牲口的具体困难。（二）调查研究水渠水车水井情况，并与农民商量计划整修旧渠旧井旧水车及开渠凿井增加水车的计划与办法，以作办理农贷的一部分准备工作。（三）由于战争形势的发展，棉花的需要量增加了，产棉区应研究增产棉花的办法，了解农民生产棉花的困难（种麦与种棉的矛盾），提早计划明年植棉数，并解决困难（如棉种的品种与数量）。（四）病虫害的防除，应即注意选种的宣传组织工作，虫害除组织秋耕冬耕外，应计划使用杀虫药剂。（五）发动群众在冬季积煤积柴，在必要地区筹设煤站。山地打柴要与护林相结合。以上这些工作，在冬季尽可能的准备好。
    四、利用农闲及冬季，采取各种活泼形式：如晒太阳、开调查会等，与农民座谈生产问题，以吸收提倡优良的耕作方法，提倡劳动致富，并了解农民生产中的切实困难，以研究解决的办法，宣传农民能够实行的进步技术，这是领导生产的最好方法。
    五、除一般指导外，希望多研究些典型经验，不论是组织副业生产也好，积肥经验也好，冬耕、座谈会经验也好，多研究典型经验，就可以把领导提高一步。
    此外，并请把今年种麦秋耕地的数字与经验报告我们。（不另行文）
