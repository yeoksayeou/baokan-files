    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 31st: Starting from October 20th, the currencies of the North China and Northwest Liberated Areas have a fixed exchange rate and are mutually usable. The exchange rate between the Ji'nan Bank notes of the North China Liberated Area and the Northwest Farmers Bank notes of the Northwest (Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Shanxi-Suiyuan) Liberated Area is one to twenty, that is, one yuan of Ji'nan Bank note equals twenty yuan of Northwest Farmers Bank note. The exchange rate between the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Bank notes and the Northwest Farmers Bank notes is one to two, that is, one yuan of Jin-Cha-Ji Bank note equals two yuan of Northwest Farmers Bank note. From now on, all transactions and all public and private payments in any place in the two major liberated areas will be circulated and paid according to this exchange rate. This fixed exchange rate and joint use of currencies in the North China and Northwest Liberated Areas will greatly benefit the economic life of the people in the two regions, as well as the development and prosperity of material exchanges and industry and commerce. Previously, the currencies of the North China Liberated Area and the East China Liberated Area had been stipulated with a fixed exchange rate and were mutually circulated. Thus far, in the vast liberated areas south of the Ping-Sui Railway and north of the Longhai Railway, including the three major liberated areas of North China, East China, and Northwest China, the currencies have been mutually circulated.

    华北、西北两解放区货币
    固定比价统一流通使用
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】十月二十日起，华北、西北两大解放区的货币已固定比价，互相通用。华北解放区原冀南银行钞票与西北（陕甘宁、晋绥）解放区西北农民银行钞票的比价为一比二十，即一元冀南钞等于二十元西北农钞。原晋察冀边区银行钞票与西北农民银行钞票的比价为一比二，即一元晋察冀边钞等于二元西北农钞。今后两大解放区任何地方所有往来交易一切公私款项往来，一律按此比价流通收付。这次华北与西北两大解放区的货币固定比价，联合通用，对于两区人民经济生活，以及物资交流与工商业的发展繁荣，俾益甚大。前此，华北解放区与华东解放区的货币，已规定固定比价，互相流通。至此，平绥路以南、陇海路以北包括华北、华东、西北三大解放区的广大解放区内，货币已互相流通。
