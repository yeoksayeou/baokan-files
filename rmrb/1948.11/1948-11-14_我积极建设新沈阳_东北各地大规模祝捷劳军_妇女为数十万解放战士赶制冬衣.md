Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 11th: The Shenyang Military Control Commission and the democratic government are leading the people of the city to actively build a new Shenyang. The day after the battle ended (November 3rd), some of the city's electric lights were turned back on. On the 4th, all telephones were repaired, and all agencies resumed operations. Former civil servants and employees all complied with the Military Control Commission's order and temporarily returned to their original posts. The post office resumed postal services within the city on the 5th and began postal services with various liberated areas. Tram and tap water lines are also being actively repaired. Railway workers repaired dozens of miles of railways and two bridges destroyed by the enemy within two days. The railway lines radiating from Shenyang to the east, west, north, and south are all being repaired. The city's newspaper, the Shenyang Times, was launched on the 5th. The Northeast Bookstore also opened on the same day, and more than 1,200 kinds of books and magazines have been shipped in, selling very well. Plans are underway to reprint a large number of them to meet the needs of the vast number of readers.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, November 11th: The people of Northeast China, seething with the joy of victory, are launching an unprecedented large-scale campaign to comfort the troops. In recent days, comfort delegations from the support-the-front committees and relevant departments of provinces, cities, and counties have been arriving in a steady stream. In front of the hospitals for the wounded and sick, the crowds of people offering comfort are so crowded that it is impossible to move, and the comfort goods are piled up like mountains. According to incomplete statistics from Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province, and the Mudanjiang Dong'an District alone, more than 655 million yuan in Northeast currency has been received from all walks of life for troop comfort, and other items are abundant. Employees of factories directly under the Heilongjiang Provincial Enterprise Bureau actively responded, donating more than 33 million yuan. Factories in various places have increased voluntary labor. More than 3,000 members of the Communist Youth League and the Children's League in Harbin have been rushing to write letters of condolence and prepare condolence bags for days. In just two days, they wrote more than 87,000 letters of condolence, made more than 6,000 condolence bags, and raised more than 300 million yuan worth of comfort goods. Teachers and students from schools such as the Northeast Institute of Natural Sciences and Xingzhi Normal School also donated a large amount of saved grain and funds. People from all walks of life in Qiqihar City voluntarily participated in blood transfusions for the wounded and sick. In the two days after the Jinzhou victory alone, more than 170 members of the Teachers' Union requested blood transfusions. The people of various counties in Nenjiang and Heilongjiang Provinces launched a campaign to comfort the troops and actively set up reception centers for the wounded and prisoner-of-war camps. The people of Anda County in Nenjiang are building warm kang for a large number of liberated soldiers to keep them warm. People from all walks of life in Jiamusi, Jilin, Andong and other cities held grand celebration meetings for days and donated huge sums of money to comfort the troops. As many as 80,000 people attended one meeting in Andong City. More than 50 Yangko teams and dozens of gongs and drums welcomed a large number of comforting troops from all directions. After the meeting, a grand parade was held.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 11th: With the great victories of the Northeast People's Liberation Army in the battles of Jinzhou, Western Liaoning, Changchun, and Shenyang, hundreds of thousands of liberated Kuomintang soldiers have been sent to the rear. They were only wearing single clothes when they were liberated, and now the problem of winter clothing needs to be solved urgently. After the task of making winter clothes for the People's Liberation Army was completed, women in various parts of Northeast China continued to work day and night to make winter clothes for the large number of liberated Kuomintang soldiers. Female cotton workers and women in Harbin, Mudanjiang, Jiamusi, Qiqihar, Jilin, Tumen, Andong and other cities are processing and sewing with great excitement. They said happily: "Let the liberated Kuomintang soldiers wear warm clothes so that they can study hard and join the People's Liberation Army to fight Chiang Kai-shek in the future." In addition to opening more cotton factories, Harbin has also organized more than 370 factories in eight districts, operating 466 machines, to rush to make cotton gloves. In the past five months, women in Andong City have made more than 400,000 pairs of military shoes, and now they have accepted a new task of making hundreds of thousands of pairs of shoes. In addition, the staff of military supply and clothing factories in various places have also enthusiastically joined the support-the-front movement. A certain factory not only completed its scheduled plan six days ahead of schedule, but also produced an additional 100,000 pairs of gloves and 100,000 pairs of socks.
