　　In Huolu and Lixian Counties, there are still households evicted without resettlement.
  　The County Party Committee should quickly inspect and resettle them.

Editor:
    I am from Xuzhuang, Third District, Huolu. I was struggled against last November. My family had 36 mu of land, 23 rooms, a mule, and all the main farm tools. The whole family of nine depended on labor to live. We hired some short-term laborers during busy times, no more than 20 to 30 workdays a year. Three or four people in my family participated in the main labor. When my uncle and father were young, the family only had 8 mu of land. They worked as short-term laborers for others every day, and took time to do their own work, saving money slowly to build houses and buy land. There was no feudal exploitation at all. It has been more than eight months since I was evicted, and I have not been allowed to return home. None of the furniture and other items in my home were distributed to me. Each person was only allocated a little more than one mu of land, a total of 16 mu. The autumn harvest yielded more than four shi of grain, which is really difficult to maintain a living. May I ask how my family's problem should be handled?

Editor:
    The People's Daily speaks for the common people. Now I am raising my problem, and I ask you to solve it for me. Before the July 7th Incident, I cultivated 90 mu of land, had 15 rooms, and the whole family of five labored, only hiring one long-term worker. After the July 7th Incident, I stopped hiring long-term workers, and there were still 15 people, with 60 mu of land. I have three sons in total. The second is in the artillery school, and the third is in a state-owned store. During the land reform, I was evicted. Now, as winter is approaching, what should I do if I am not allowed to return home? Please resolve this quickly and write me a letter. I am waiting for you like I am waiting for heaven.

Editor:
    When my father was alive, he had 40 mu of land and sometimes hired some short-term workers. In my generation, we had 70 mu of land. In the 30th year of the Republic of China [1941], there were 19 people, with three people laboring, and sometimes we hired people, but we owed 300 yuan in silver dollars. I have no objection to the land reform, but I should not have been evicted. Now I have 19 people, and only 40 mu of land are left. I wasn't given anything else, and I still haven't been allowed to return home. How can I get through the winter? Please write me back a letter no matter what.

    Answer: According to the letters from your three households, the main labor force in your families is no less than three or four people, hiring only one long-term worker, or some short-term workers during busy times. If what you say is true, and there is no other feudal exploitation, then your amount of exploitation should not, and will not exceed 25% of your total income. Therefore, your class status should be middle peasant, not rich peasant. The reason you were struggled against and evicted may be due to your large estate or other reasons in your family (whether you were local bullies or collaborated with the enemy and puppets during the Anti-Japanese War is unclear), so you should examine yourselves. Our Party is now working to conclude the land reform work and clear up the remaining problems (including those who were evicted and have no means of living), and it is estimated that your problems will be resolved soon. The Huolu and Lixian County Party Committees should also check whether the situation is true, and whether there are similar situations, and quickly resettle and resolve them.

### 获鹿蠡县还有未安置的扫地出门户　县委应快检查安置

专栏：询问与答覆

　　获鹿蠡县还有未安置的扫地出门户
  　县委应快检查安置编辑同志：
    我是获鹿三区徐庄人，去年十一月被斗争。家中土地三十六亩，房二十三间，骡子一个，主要农具都有，全家九口都靠劳动生活，忙时用几个短工，每年不过二十到三十个工，家中三、四个人参加主要劳动。我伯父和我父亲幼时，家中只有地八亩，每天给人家当短工，再抽暇做自己的活，慢慢节约，修房买地，并没有一点封建剥削。自被扫地出门，已八个多月了，还未让回家，家中东西家具等一点没分给。每人只分地一亩多，共分地十六亩，秋收打了四石多粮食，实在难维持生活。请问对我家的问题应如何处理？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　张群一编辑同志：
    人民日报是为老百姓说话的，现在我提出我的问题，请你们给我解决。在七七事变前，我种九十亩地，十五间房，全家五个劳动，只雇一个长工，全家十六口人，七七事变后不雇长工了，还有十五口人，六十亩地。我共有三个儿子，老二在炮兵学校，老三在公营商店。在土改中，把我扫地出门了。现在眼看冬天来了，不叫回家，怎么办呢？请迅速解决，给我来信，我盼天似的盼着你们。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　蠡县中孟尝苑德俊编辑同志：
    我父亲时，手中四十亩地，有时雇些短工。在我这一辈，七十亩地。民国三十年十九口人，三个人劳动，有时还雇人，但欠债三百元现洋，对于土改，我没意见，可是不该把我扫地出门。现在我十九口人，只留四十亩地，其他什么都不给，到现在还不叫我回家，冬天怎么过得去？无论如何请给我回个信。
   　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　蠡县中孟尝张老信
    答：根据你们三户来信，你们家庭的主要劳动力，都不下三四人，只雇一个长工，或忙时雇些短工，假如你们所讲属实，又没有其他封建剥削，则你们的剥削份量，没有也不会超过你们总收入的百分之二十五，所以你们的成份应该是中农，而不是富农。这中间可能是由于你们的铺摊大，或在家中有其他缘故（是否平时恶霸或抗日期间与敌伪不清楚等），对你们进行斗争扫地出门了，这你们倒应检查一下自己。我们党正在那里作结束土改工作，清理遗留问题，（包括扫地出门无以为生的人在内）估计会对你们问题很快解决。获鹿、蠡县县委，亦应检查，情况是否属实，并有无类似此种事情，迅速予以安置解决。
