Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, November 9th: The Shandong Corps Headquarters and Political Department of the East China Field Army, with the approval of the Central Military Commission of the Chinese Communist Party, the East China Military Region, and the East China Field Army Headquarters Political Department, have specially conferred the honorary titles of "Jinan First Regiment" and "Jinan Second Regiment" to the Zhang-Hu Regiment of the Nie-Liu Column and the Tian-Zhang Regiment of the Zhou-Liao Column respectively, in recognition of their special meritorious service in the Jinan Campaign. A commendation order was issued, calling on the entire army of the corps to learn from the heroic achievements of these two regiments and their excellent fighting style of being resolute, brave, tenacious, resourceful, flexible, fighting continuously, and not fearing sacrifice.

The Zhang-Hu Regiment, which won the title of "Jinan First Regiment," established special merits in the battles to break through both the outer and inner cities of Jinan. On the evening of September 23rd, in the battle to attack the inner city, the regiment's assault team, under the cover of powerful artillery fire, carried out continuous blasting, crossed the moat, which was fifteen to fifty meters wide, overcame layers of obstacles, and with unwavering repeated assaults, ascended the fourteen-meter-high southeast city wall at dawn on the 24th. On the city wall, the regiment braved the intense fire from the enemy's high points within the city and the flanking fire from the enemy on both sides of the city wall, and engaged in bayonet charges with the counterattacking enemy for four hours, holding the city wall position. Another part of the regiment rushed into the city, fighting back and forth with the defending enemy, fighting alone for seven hours, and opening up a broad path for the advancing follow-up troops. Throughout the entire campaign, the regiment was even better at observing urban policies and military discipline, and achieved a complete victory in both military and political terms.

The Tian-Zhang Regiment, which won the title of "Jinan Second Regiment," divided and annihilated the enemy when breaking through the enemy's last line of defense in the commercial port area. At dawn on the 24th, the regiment crossed the sea of fire caused by the enemy's fierce artillery fire in front of the position and ascended the southwest city wall. On the narrow city wall, the regiment fought tenaciously with an invincible spirit, crushing two fierce counterattacks by enemy regiments, holding the breach, and part of it jumped into the city and launched an attack on the enemy's heart, powerfully supporting the fraternal troops who had broken in from the southeast of the city.
