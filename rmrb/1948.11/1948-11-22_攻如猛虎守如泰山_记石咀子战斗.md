　　Attack Like a Fierce Tiger, Defend Like Mount Tai
    A Record of the Battle of Shizuizi
    Yuan Mingruan
    Perhaps the Yan bandits never dreamed that a group of fortifications defended by a single battalion could be shattered by the iron fist of the People's Liberation Army in just fourteen minutes. Under the cover of intense artillery fire, the blasting squad blew up the bunkers at the assault route, and the assault team, led by Yao Ziyuan and Li Yingwen, advanced like flying arrows into the enemy's depths. When the enemy concentrated all their forces to organize a counterattack, our shifted and concentrated artillery fire fell right into the enemy's ranks. Fourteen minutes (faster than a practice attack) opened the first act of the Battle of Shizuizi. Not enough troops? One battalion. Not strong enough fortifications? The Yan bandits called it their "solid defense," called it the "Underground Tiger," called it the "Invincible Bunker." Shizuizi was one of the important commanding heights of the Yan bandits' eastern mountain stronghold and a barrier for the enemy to hold Taiyuan. The enemy built positions on every hilltop, with a main bunker surrounded by barbed wire and a moat at important positions. Bunkers or fire points were set up at the corners of the positions, providing mutual support with flanking fire when one position was attacked.

    The enemy knew the importance of Shizuizi. Losing Shizuizi meant losing the gateway to the eastern mountains, and losing the eastern mountains meant losing half of Taiyuan. Therefore, after the vast majority of the defensive positions at Shizuizi were shattered, the Yan bandits pieced together three regiments in the illusion of retaking the lost positions. On a forward position on the edge of a gully, we maintained only ten or so people throughout. Regardless of the enemy's aircraft and artillery fire, and despite the fatigue of continuous fighting and a night of fortification work, we persevered all day, from early morning until dusk, at a distance of only about one hundred meters from the enemy, until we finally repelled them. Earthwork operations under enemy fire were a familiar action for our soldiers. When a single foxhole was destroyed, another was built. We didn't fire our guns casually, and we didn't throw grenades carelessly. We aimed at the target and hit it accurately every time. The hungry enemy also threw grenades, but how far could they throw them? As they threw, the soldiers observing in the shelters laughed. Our blasting team, take Yan Xiurong for example, could only throw 28 meters when training began, but now he can throw more than 44 meters. The enemy's grenades couldn't reach us, but our grenades could hit and explode among the enemy as long as they dared to advance. Initially, under the officers' pistols and sabers, the enemy made three consecutive desperate charges, but they were repelled one after another. In the end, they only huddled their heads and stayed at the starting point of the attack, sometimes shouting "Charge! Charge!" but never advancing a step. At no time did our soldiers forget to speak out. Whenever there was an opportunity, they gave advice to the people driven to fight by the Yan bandits: "We have fought to the front of Taiyuan City, shouldn't you quickly think of a way out?" "Don't you understand the lenient policy of the People's Liberation Army?" "We have also eliminated the 'Trained Division' and the '10th Column' with Japanese elements. What will be the result of fighting for Yan Xishan?" This voice was like a lighthouse, like a signpost, pointing out a way out for the people driven to fight by the Yan bandits.

　　攻如猛虎守如泰山
    记石咀子战斗
    袁明阮
    恐怕阎匪做梦也没有想到，由一个营困守的一个集团工事，不过十四分钟，就被人民解放军的铁拳粉碎了。在猛烈炮火掩护下，爆破小组把突击路口的地堡炸破后，以姚自元与李英文为首的突击队，飞箭似的一直向着敌人纵深发展。当敌人集中全力正在组织反扑的时候，我们转移了的密集炮火，正好落在敌人的人群当中。十四分钟（比演习攻坚还快）揭开了石咀子战斗的第一幕。兵力不多吗？一个营；工事不坚固吗？阎匪说这是他的“坚固设防”，叫做“地下虎”，叫做“无敌碉”。石咀子是太原东山匪重要制高据点之一，是敌人困守太原的屏障。敌人在每一个山头上都建有阵地，在重要阵地当中一个主碉周围，附以铁丝网和外壕，在阵地错角路口上设有地堡或火力点；一个阵地被攻击，其他阵地也以侧翼射击，互相支援。
    石咀子的重要，敌人是知道的。丢掉石咀子，就是丢掉东山的门户，而丢了东山，就等于太原丢了一半。因此，阎匪在石咀子绝大多数防御阵地受到粉碎以后，又拼凑了三个团的兵力，幻想夺回已经失去了的阵地。在沟边一个前沿阵地上，我始终只保持十来个人，不管敌人的飞机炮火，不顾连续战斗与修了一夜工事的疲劳，在敌我相距不过一百公尺左右处，从清早到黄昏，整整坚持了一天，直到最后把敌人打退为止。在敌人火力下的土工作业，这是我们战士们熟练了的动作，一个单人掩体被摧毁了，另一个又建立起来。枪不随便打，手榴弹不随便放，要打就瞄准目标，百发百中。饥饿的敌人，也扔手榴弹，但能扔多远呢？他们一面扔，我们在掩蔽体内观察的战士一面笑。我们的爆破组，拿阎秀荣来说，练兵开始的时候，还只能扔廿八公尺，现在一扔就是四十四公尺以上。敌人的手榴弹打不着我们，而我们的手榴弹只要敌人敢前进，就可以打到他当中去开花。开始，在军官们的手枪与指挥刀之下，敌人还连续作了三次挣扎性的冲锋，但一次接着一次被打下去了。最后，只有缩着脑袋，一直停留在进攻出发地，有时也喊几声“冲呀！冲呀！”但始终并未前进一步。在任何时候，我们的战士都没有忘记用嘴喊话，只要有机会，就向被阎匪驱使作战的人们发出忠告：“我们打到太原城跟前来了，你们还不赶快想办法吗？”“解放军的宽大政策你们还不了解吗？”“亲训师和有日本人的十纵队我们也消灭了，你们替阎锡山打仗，会有什么结果呢？”这声音象灯塔，象路标，给被阎匪驱使作战的人们指出了一条活路。
