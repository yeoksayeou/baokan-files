The past two months have been filled with successive brilliant victories in the People's Liberation War. These victories have drastically changed the national situation and greatly accelerated the time to achieve the victory of the Chinese revolution. In just two months since the start of the People's Liberation Army's autumn offensive, it has eliminated more than 600,000 of the Chiang troops; liberated important cities such as Jinan, Jinzhou, Shenyang, Changchun, Yantai, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Baotou, and Chengde; completed the liberation of the entire Northeast; and recently our various armies have been encircling Xuzhou on all sides, and hundreds of thousands of Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on the southern front are facing annihilation. These great victories have made the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang totter. On the one hand, it faces an irretrievable rapid military defeat, and on the other hand, it faces an unprecedented economic crisis after the collapse of the gold yuan and price controls. Now the Chiang bandit's interior is panic-stricken and in chaos, living in fear every day; the US imperialists standing behind the Chiang bandit are also extremely panicked. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that in about a year, it may be possible to overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary government from its roots. That is to say, the great Chinese People's Liberation War has definitely approached the national victory. This is a completely scientific estimate, and it is a powerful call and encouragement to our entire party, army, and people.

Our North China military and civilians are currently heroically besieging Taiyuan in this victorious autumn offensive, in order to finally end Yan Xishan’s forty years of reactionary rule and liberate the entire Shanxi; the Chiang-Fu bandit army's plot to attack Shijiazhuang has been crushed by our army; in the Yubei battle, more than 10,000 enemies were annihilated and six cities were captured. Now, except for the three points of Xinxiang, Anyang, and Huixian, there are no more bandits in the entire Yubei region. The bandit army on the northern front is waiting for the final blow from the Northeast Liberation Army and the North China Liberation Army pouring into the customs. The liberation of Peiping and Tianjin, and the liberation of the entire North China, is just around the corner. After liberating Peiping and Tianjin and liberating the entire North China, we will also cooperate with the Liberation Army in neighboring regions to fight to Nanjing and liberate the whole of China. Chiang Kai-shek, this wounded beast, is already on its last breath. We must make another effort and give him several heavy blows like the recent autumn offensive, and finally send him to his grave. Now, the conscription mobilization being carried out in designated areas is to strengthen the People's Liberation Army, completely eliminate the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and establish a new democratic New China as soon as possible.

Joining the People's Liberation Army is the most glorious cause. This army is the people's army led by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, a victorious army that is tempered into steel, invincible, and unconquerable; this army is the army that the people of the whole country are guiding and hoping for to relieve their pain and create a happy life, and it is the only army in China's five thousand years of history that has created a new era of people's rule. Therefore, joining such an army is not only the greatest honor, but also the greatest fortune.

The masses in most areas of our North China Liberated Area have already stood up through land reform, acquired land, houses, and livestock, and started a happy life. Since the anti-Chiang war, 500,000 liberated peasants in our North China Liberated Area have joined the Liberation Army. They have not only fought heroically against the enemy on the North China battlefield, but also on the Central Plains and other battlefields; they have created countless heroic deeds that are worthy of praise and tears; they have already made great contributions to the people's cause. The people of North China will be proud of these excellent children, and our descendants will always remember them and sing the praises of their great achievements. In addition to actively supporting the front lines, the people in the rear should enthusiastically and warmly join the army. Do not think that because our North China Liberated Area has achieved a relatively peaceful environment, everything is fine and we can rest easy; we should see that the whole country is still in a state of war, and many places in the country still need to be liberated by us. Now is the critical historical moment when we are at the cusp of national victory and need to make the final effort. No matter how far away we are from the front lines, our lives are closely linked to the victory of the war, and our fate is closely linked to the fate of the people of the whole country. Only by finally and completely eliminating the rule of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang can the fruits of victory that have been gained be guaranteed to be consolidated, and can the construction of a new democratic country truly begin, building a happier and more fulfilling life for our parents, wives, children, and daughters.

In order to win the national victory of the People's Liberation War, and to protect the freedom and happiness of every person, just as conscription mobilization is being carried out in some areas of North China, we call on the people of those areas to enthusiastically join the army, and especially call on Communist Party members to play a pioneering and leading role in the conscription movement. Party members are the vanguard of the masses, and leading the masses to join the army is their bounden duty. In the era of war, every party member should remember: the most glorious post is on the front lines. Party members must temper their party spirit, class position, and ability to lead the masses in the war, and turn themselves into true heroes of the people. We must oppose the backward and conservative thinking of being afraid to go out, afraid of hardship, and wanting to die in their hometowns for the rest of their lives. We are an emerging force with a great future, just like the rising sun, and our spirit should be vigorous, enterprising, and promising. Now is the time for all outstanding children of the people and outstanding Communist Party members to make contributions and show their talents.

In the conscription movement, women must actively respond and demonstrate exemplary roles. In the old society, women suffered the most oppression and the deepest pain. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, they have begun to be liberated. But to achieve complete liberation, we must strive for the final victory of the Liberation War. Therefore, we must enthusiastically send our sons and husbands, and mobilize our brothers to go to the front lines. Experience has shown that the leading role played by women in the conscription movement is extremely great. After the men leave, the women must also work hard at home to produce and shoulder various tasks in the locality, so that their social status can be further improved and their working ability can be honed.

The closer the war is to victory, the more stable the environment in the rear becomes. It is all the more possible for the people in the rear to carry out production and construction work, not only to do a better job in supporting the front lines, but also to take care of military dependents and solve all the difficulties of military dependents. During the conscription movement, we should deeply publicize the victorious situation of the war, and fully develop the fine experience and tradition of past self-reporting and public discussion, and the leading role of party members and cadres. Let us send thousands upon thousands of outstanding children of the people to the Liberation Army! Let our ever-victorious and invincible Liberation Army become stronger and more powerful, and capture Peiping and Tianjin, liberate the entire North China, capture Nanjing, liberate the whole of China, and make the New China that the 450 million people have been looking forward to day and night be born as soon as possible!

　　光荣的岗位在前线
    最近两个月是充满着人民解放战争连续光辉胜利的两个月，这些胜利急遽地改变了全国形势，大大提早了中国革命胜利的时间。人民解放军秋季攻势开始不过两月，已消灭了蒋军六十余万；解放了济南、锦州、沈阳、长春、烟台、郑州、开封、包头、承德等重要城市；完成了东北全境的解放；最近我各路大军正四面包围徐州，南线数十万蒋匪军队，正面临覆没。这些伟大的胜利，已使蒋介石匪帮统治，摇摇欲坠。它一方面面对着无可挽救的迅速的军事溃败，另一方面，面对着金圆券和限价崩溃后空前的经济危机。现在蒋匪内部恐慌混乱，惶惶不可终日；站在蒋匪背后的美帝国主义，也极度惊慌。中共中央指出，再有一年左右时间，就可能将国民党反动政府从根本上打倒，这就是说，伟大的中国人民解放战争，已确切地迫近了全国的胜利，这是完全科学的估计，这是对我全党、全军、全国人民有力的号召和鼓舞。
    我华北军民在这一秋季攻势的胜利中，正在英勇围攻太原，以最后结束阎匪四十年的反动统治，解放全山西；蒋傅匪军妄图袭击石家庄的阴谋，又已被我军粉碎；豫北作战，歼敌万余，克城六座，现在除了新乡、安阳、辉县三点外，豫北全境已无匪踪。北线匪军正等待着源源入关的东北解放军与华北解放军的最后一击，平津解放，全华北解放，就在眼前。解放了平津，解放了全华北之后，我们还要配合友邻区的解放军，打到南京去，解放全中国。蒋匪这支负了伤的野兽已经奄奄一息，我们要再努一把力，给他几个如象最近秋季攻势那样的沉重打击，把他最后送进坟墓。现在，在指定地区进行的参军动员，就是为了壮大人民解放军，彻底消灭蒋介石匪帮的统治，早日建立新民主主义的新中国。
    参加人民解放军，是最光荣的事业。这个军队，是毛主席和朱总司令所领导的人民军队，是百炼成钢战无不胜攻无不克的常胜军；这个军队是全国人民所引导盼望来为他们解除痛苦、创造幸福生活的军队，是中国五千年历史上独一无二的开创人民统治的新时代的军队。因此，参加这样的军队，不仅是最大的光荣，而且也是最大的幸运。
    我华北解放区大部分地区的群众，已经在土改中翻了身，有了土地，房屋和牲口，开始了幸福的生活。反蒋战争以来，我华北解放区已有五十万翻身农民参加了解放军，他们不但在华北战场上，而且也在中原及其他各战场上和敌人英勇作战；创造了无数可歌可泣的英雄事迹；他们对于人民事业已经作了伟大的贡献，华北人民将以他们这些优秀子弟为骄傲，我们的后代亦将永远记忆他们，歌颂他们的丰功伟业。后方人民除了积极支援前线外，还应踊跃地热烈的参军。不要因为我华北解放区已经取得了相对和平环境，就万事大吉，高枕无忧；应当看到，全国还是战争的环境，全国许多地方还待我们去解放，现在正是处在全国胜利、需要我们努最后一把力的重大历史关头。不管我们所处的地方距离前线有多远，我们的生活和战争的胜利是密切相连的，我们的命运和全国人民的命运是密切相连的。必须最后地彻底地消灭将介石国民党的统治，才能使已得的胜利果实有巩固的保证，才能真正开始新民主主义国家的建设，为我们的父母妻子儿女建设更幸福更美满的生活。
    为了争取人民解放战争的全国胜利，为了保卫每个人民的自由和幸福，正当我华北部分地区正在进行参军动员的时候，我们号召那些地区的人民踊跃参军，特别号召共产党员在参军运动中起先锋的带头作用。党员是群众的先锋队，带领群众参军是他们应尽的责任。在战争的时代，每个党员都应记着：最光荣的岗位是在前线。党员们要在战争中锻炼自己的党性、阶级立场，和领导群众的能力，把自己变成真正人民的英雄。必须反对那种怕出门、怕吃苦、一辈子老死家乡的落后保守思想。我们是新兴的有远大前途的力量，正如旭日初升，我们的精神应当是朝气蓬勃，进取有为的。现在是一切优秀的人民子弟，优秀的共产党员们建功立业、大显身手的时候了。
    在参军运动中，妇女们要积极响应，表现模范的作用。在旧社会中，妇女最受压迫，痛苦最深。在共产党领导之下，她们已经开始得到解放。但要得到彻底的解放，必须争取解放战争的最后胜利。因此必须热烈地送儿、送郎，动员自己的兄弟上前线。经验证明，妇女在参军运动中所起的带头作用是极其巨大的。男子们走后，妇女们还要在家里努力生产，负担地方上各项工作，这样，更可提高她们的社会地位，并锻炼她们的工作能力。
    战争愈接近胜利，后方的环境，就愈加安定。后方人民就更有可能展开生产建设工作，不仅把支援前线做得更好，而且照顾军属，解决军属一切困难，也应当做得更好。在参军运动中，应当深入宣传战争胜利的形势，充分发扬过去自报公议，党员、干部带头的优良经验和传统。让我们把成千成万的优秀人民子弟送到解放军里去吧！让我们常胜的、所向无敌的解放军变成更壮大、更坚强，早日打下平津、解放全华北，打下南京、解放全中国，使四万万五千万人民朝夕盼望的新中国早日诞生吧！
