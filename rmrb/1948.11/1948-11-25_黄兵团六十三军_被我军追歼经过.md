　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 23rd: A front-line reporter reports on the process of our army pursuing and annihilating Huang Botao's 63rd Army between Yantou and Yaowan, north of Suqian, stating: When our main force pressed towards the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, Huang Botao's bandit army, wandering around Xin'an, was deeply afraid of being annihilated and attempted to retreat to Xuzhou. However, there was only one road going west. Huang ordered his 63rd Army to flee southwest from Xin'an to Yaowan, cross the Grand Canal and escape westward, while covering his left flank. On the afternoon of the 8th, the 63rd Army fled in panic. When they reached Yantou, 50 li southwest of Xin'an, they had just stopped to cook, not even put the rice in the pot, when the vanguard of our army, which was following closely, had already reached the front of the army headquarters. Chen Zhang, the army commander, hurriedly ordered a breakout towards Yaowan. Two battalions each from the 454th and 456th Regiments of his 152nd Division were annihilated by us on the afternoon of the 9th. The 455th Regiment of the 152nd Division, which had fled to the east of Yaowan, was also fiercely attacked head-on by another unit of our army that suddenly appeared west of the river on the 8th, and two battalions were annihilated. By this time, the enemy army's attempt to escape westward from Yaowan was hopeless. According to enemy prisoners, when Chen Zhang led his troops to Yaowan on the afternoon of the 9th, he urgently asked Huang Botao for help. By the time Huang Botao ordered Chen Zhang to quickly move south to Suqian to cross the Grand Canal, the 63rd Army had already fallen into our encirclement. Later, Huang ordered Chen Zhang to hold fast and wait for reinforcements. But in reality, Huang Botao himself was already surrounded by another unit of our army near Nianzhuang. On the evening of the 10th, our army cleared out the enemy in the surrounding villages. At that time, a large number of ammunition air-dropped by US-aided Chiang planes was also seized by us. At 4:30 pm on the afternoon of the 11th, our army launched a general attack, annihilating the enemy who vainly attempted to fight to the death, house by house. By 2:30 am on the morning of the 12th, our army had eliminated the enemy in the last resistance position, the Catholic Church. The 63rd Army of Huang Botao's bandit army was completely wiped out.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 23rd: A front-line reporter reported on the capture of Lei Xiumin, commander of the 152nd Division of Huang Botao's 63rd Army, stating: At about 10 pm on the night of the 10th, the battle to encircle and annihilate Huang Botao's 63rd Army in Yaowan was in full swing. The 7th Company of our regiment was on guard on the north bank of Yaowan when they suddenly saw a group of enemies crossing the river, shouting as they came ashore: "Don't shoot, we surrender!" An enemy soldier pointed behind him and said: "There's the division commander." At this time, Liu Hongqiao, the commander of our 7th Company, saw two dark figures running west from the riverbank. Commander Liu fired two shots, and the two dark figures lay down and did not move. Commander Liu and the soldiers went up to take a look and saw a fat guy covered in mud lying on the ground pretending to be dead, but the orderly next to him pulled him up. Commander Liu took off the fat guy's revolver and said to him: "Tell the truth, your life will be guaranteed." The fat guy stuttered and said: "I am the 152nd Division Commander, ... the acting division commander, ... I am old, I want to go home. ......" This was Lei Xiumin, commander of the 152nd Division. Commander Liu took him into the room to warm himself by the fire and explained our army's policy of lenient treatment of prisoners of war to him. When the reporter saw him, he had already dried his clothes. He said to the reporter: "When the 63rd Army retreated southwest from Xin'an, I was ordered to lead the 455th Regiment to Yaowan to build a bridge and seal the boats. The bridge was not built, and I was surrounded by your army on all sides. Your army fought so fiercely. The soldiers were young, healthy, technically skilled, and had good weapons, especially the infantry-artillery coordination, which made it impossible for me to hold my ground. The troops were all wiped out. Seeing that I really couldn't hold out any longer, I got on a boat and fled across the river. The boat didn't reach the shore, so I jumped in a hurry, so I fell into the water and got covered in mud." Note: Lei Xiumin is from Heshan County, Guangdong, is 45 years old, graduated from the Japanese Military Academy, and served as the Chief of Staff, Deputy Division Commander, and Director of the Political Department of the Kuomintang Army 152nd Division.

　　黄兵团六十三军
  　被我军追歼经过
    【新华社淮海前线廿三日电】前线记者报导我军于宿迁北之堰头、窑湾间追歼黄伯韬兵团之六十三军经过称：当我大军压抵陇海东段时，徘徊于新安一带之黄伯韬兵团深惧被歼，图向徐州龟缩。但西去公路只有一条，黄匪即使其所辖之六十三军从新安向西南窜窑湾，渡运河西逃，并掩护其左翼。八日下午，六十三军惊慌奔窜，及至新安西南五十里之堰头时，刚停下做饭，尚未及下米，而尾随急追之我军某部先头部队已经打到该军军部门前。该军军长陈章慌忙下令向窑湾突围。其一五二师之四五四团、四五六团各两个营，即于九日下午被我歼灭。逃至窑湾东的一五二师四五五团，亦于八日被突然出现于河西的另部我军迎头痛击，两个营被歼灭。至此，该军由窑湾西渡逃命企图，乃告绝望。据敌俘供称：九日下午陈章率部逃抵窑湾时，曾急向黄伯韬求救，迨黄伯韬命令陈章迅速南下至宿迁渡运河时，六十三军早已落入我包围圈中。后来，黄又命令陈章固守待援。但实际上这时黄伯韬自己也已被另部我军包围于碾庄一带。十日晚，我军肃清外围村落之敌。其时，美援蒋机空投之大批弹药，亦为我缴获。十一日下午四时半，我军发起总攻，逐屋逐房地歼灭妄图拼死挣扎之敌，至十二日晨二时半，我军将最后抵抗阵地天主堂之敌解决。敌黄兵团之六十三军至此全部覆没。
    【新华社淮海前线二十三日电】前线记者报导黄伯韬兵团之六十三军一五二师师长雷秀民被俘经过称：十日夜十时许，我军围歼窑湾黄兵团六十三军的战斗正在激烈进行，我某团七连在窑湾北岸警戒，忽见一群敌人渡过河来，上岸就喊：“别打，我们是投降的！”一个敌兵并指着后面说：“还有师长。”这时，我七连连长刘洪乔看见两个黑影从河边向西跑，刘连长打了两枪，那两个黑影就躺下不动了。刘连长和战士们上去一看，有一个满身泥水的胖大个子躺在地上装死不动，还是在他旁边的勤务兵把他拉起来。刘连长摘下了这胖子的左轮枪，并对他说：“说实话吧，保证你的生命安全”。这胖子才结结巴巴的说：“我是一五二师长，………是代理师长，………年纪大了，想回家。………”这就是一五二师师长雷秀民。刘连长把他带进房里烤火，并对他解释我军的宽待俘虏政策。当记者见他时他已烤干了衣服。他对记者说：“六十三军自新安向西南撤退时，我奉命率四五五团先来窑湾架桥封船，桥没架成，就受贵军四面包围了。贵军打得可厉害，士兵青年体健、技术高、武器好、尤其是步炮协同，使我固守也不成。部队都打完了，我看实在支持不住，就上船逃过河来，船没靠岸，我就急着跳，所以落到水里，弄得满身泥水。”按：雷秀民系广东可山县人，年四十五岁，日本士官学校毕业，曾任国民党军一五二师参谋主任、副师长、政治部主任。
