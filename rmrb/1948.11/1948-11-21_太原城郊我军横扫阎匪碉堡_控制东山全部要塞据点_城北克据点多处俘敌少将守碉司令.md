Xinhua News Agency, North China, 19th: News from the Taiyuan front: The People's Liberation Army on the Taiyuan front has made significant progress in the bunker-sweeping campaign in the suburbs of the city. The four fortress-like strongholds shielding Taiyuan on the eastern mountain, namely Xiaoyaotou, Niutuozhai, Nuoma, and Shantou, have been successively captured. At the same time, important areas such as Siumu Getong, Songzhuang, Huigouliang in the northeast of the city, and Nanyan and Beiyan in the southwest of the city have also been captured. Except for Xiaoyaotou, which was captured on October 31st, the remaining points were captured between the 9th and 13th of this month. The West Airport, recently rushed to completion by Yan's forces, has been brought under the control of the People's Liberation Army's artillery fire. During this period, Yan's forces, including the 27th Division, 68th Division, 69th Division, 83rd Division, and the 8th, 9th, and 10th Detachments, launched continuous counterattacks under the cover of dense artillery fire and air force support, but were all bravely repelled by the People's Liberation Army, which killed and wounded more than 4,000 of the enemy and captured more than 1,000. Zhao Rui, commander of the 8th Detachment of Yan's army, led his troops to defect in the battle of Nuoma. Thus far, all important strongholds on the eastern mountain of Taiyuan have been brought under the control of the People's Liberation Army. The four fortress-like strongholds of Niutuozhai, Xiaoyaotou, etc., are located between ten and fifteen miles northeast to south of Taiyuan City. The terrain is treacherous, and they are the main barriers in the east of Taiyuan. After losing these strongholds, the defending enemy in Taiyuan is in an even more dangerous situation.

Prior to this, the Northern Route People's Liberation Army cleared strongholds such as Qinglong Town, Guojia Kiln, Zhongshe, Shangzhuang, Beiliu, Huangzhai, and Zhoujiashan between twenty and forty miles north of Taiyuan City. In the battle to capture Zhoujiashan, the entire 3rd Regiment of the Yan's Provisional 46th Division was annihilated, and enemy Northern District Major General and bunker commander Su Yinzhou, Colonel Regiment Commander Song Shangpu, Lieutenant Colonel Deputy Regiment Commander Li Renxuan, and many other officers were captured alive. The first stage of the Taiyuan Campaign is now nearing completion. The People's Liberation Army will take various measures to consolidate the acquired positions and prepare for the necessary conditions to enter the second stage of combat.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Front, 19th: Our army on the Taiyuan front destroyed an enemy plane and controlled the West Airport recently rushed to completion by Yan's forces. After our occupation of Wusu Airport, and with the North Airport and Wangcun Airport coming under our artillery fire control, Yan's forces hastily rushed to build the West Airport near the Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant on the west bank of the Fen River west of the city, which was again brought under our artillery fire control. On the 10th of this month, five enemy transport planes landed at the airport, and our sharpshooters opened fire. The enemy planes took off in a panic, one of which was immediately destroyed by us. The next day, another enemy transport plane flew in and circled for a long time over the wreckage of the enemy plane destroyed there, not daring to land.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 19th: The East China People's Liberation Army Headquarters has just announced the preliminary results of annihilating the 44th Division of the 100th Army and the 8th Regiment of the 3rd Division of the 9th Army in the Cao Bajie and Da Gengzhuang areas on the 11th:

I. The entire direct unit of the 44th Division of the enemy's 100th Army (including the mountain artillery battalion, baggage battalion, communications company, special service company, engineering company, field hospital, etc.) and a part of its 130th Regiment (mostly annihilated on the east bank of the Grand Canal while fleeing west in the Xin'anzhen area), most of the 131st Regiment, a part of the 132nd Regiment (most of which has also been annihilated on the east bank of the Grand Canal), a part of the 8th Regiment of the 3rd Division of the 9th Army, and a part of the 2nd Engineering Regiment of the Ministry of National Defense were annihilated. More than 500 officers and soldiers, including Liu Shenghe, commander of the 44th Division, were killed, and 3,060 enemies, including Mao @wu, chief of staff of the 44th Division, were captured.
