　　Railway Workers Actively Build the Liberated Areas
  　The Ping-Sui Western Section Resumes Traffic
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 7th dispatch] The newly liberated western section of the Ping-Sui Railway, under the effective leadership of the "Ping-Sui Railway Western Section Management Office," has resumed traffic from Baotou in the west to Fengzhen, north of Datong, except for the isolated city of Gui-Sui, which is besieged by the Chiang-Fu bandit troops. The railway workers played a significant role in the rapid completion of this restoration work. When our army approached Baotou, the workers at Baotou Station, regardless of the danger, rushed to repair the railway destroyed by the Fu bandits and went out of the city to welcome the People's Liberation Army. When Jining was liberated, the station workers resisted the Fu bandits' reactionary orders of "scorched earth policy" and "retreating with the army" by dispersing and hiding. They enthusiastically served the People's Liberation Army, braving enemy aircraft strafing to drive three trains loaded with captured materials, weapons, and ammunition to safe areas. Near the Hongshaba Station, south of Jining, a destroyed Nationalist army armored train blocked traffic next to the railway. After the workers repaired it overnight, traffic was restored. At Fengzhen Station, there was also a derailed locomotive. More than 20 workers used car-lifting crowbars to lift the locomotive in one day and night and repaired it on the spot, starting a fire and driving it. Throughout the entire line, workers not only removed obstacles along the way and restored traffic, but also worked hard to save materials and actively improve work efficiency. The boiler of the water pump (or "bangpu," a transliteration of pump) at Jining Station used to burn 2,000 catties of coal every day during the Kuomintang rule, but now it has been reduced to a maximum of only 500 catties. Before liberation, the duty officer at the station would only leave one person on duty to answer the phone every night, and the rest would go home to sleep. Now, all duty personnel are on duty on time. The workers of this railway who retreated with the People's Government in September 1946 have now returned to their original posts.
    Furthermore, the Ping-Sui Railway workers in the isolated cities of Datong and Gui-Sui, unable to bear the exploitation of the Chiang-Fu bandit gangs, have fled to the liberated areas one after another. Our "Ping-Sui Railway Western Section Management Office" has taken in more than seventy people and assigned them appropriate jobs. They are all sallow-faced and emaciated, and their clothes are ragged. According to them, the Chiang-Fu bandit gangs besieged in Gui-Sui, due to lack of trains, disbanded all the railway workers. Young and middle-aged men were forcibly incorporated into the "Security Police Team," and the elderly were organized into stretcher teams, driving them to serve as cannon fodder. The liberated workers were extremely resentful when they heard this.

### 铁路员工积极建设解放区　平绥西段恢复通车

　　铁路员工积极建设解放区
  　平绥西段恢复通车
    【新华社晋绥七日电】新近解放的平绥铁路西段，在“平绥铁路西段管理处”的有效领导下，西起包头，东迄大同以北之丰镇，除了蒋傅匪军困守的归绥孤城外，已恢复通车。此次恢复工作得以迅速达成，铁路员工起了巨大作用。包头站员工在我军逼近该城时，即不顾危险的抢修被傅匪破坏的铁路，并出城欢迎人民解放军。集宁光复时，该站员工以一哄而散和躲起来的办法，反抗了傅匪“空舍清野”，“随军撤退”的反动命令。他们热情地为人民解放军服务，冒着敌机的扫射，将三列满载缴获物资及武器、弹药的火车开到安全地带。集宁以南之红沙坝车站附近的铁路旁，有击毁的国民党军的铁甲列车阻碍交通，经员工连夜抢修后即告通车。丰镇车站处亦有出轨机车，二十多名员工在一昼夜内，以起车镐抛起机车，并就地将该机车修好，生火行驶。全线员工在扫除沿途障碍，恢复通车中，并努力节约材料，积极提高工作效率。集宁车站水泵（或称帮浦均抽水机之音译）的锅炉，国民党统治时每天烧炭二千斤，现在减少到最多只烧五百斤。光复前该站值班员每夜只留一人听电话，余均回家睡觉。现在则所有值班人员都按时扼守岗位。一九四六年九月随人民政府撤退的该路员工，现已返回原地工作。
    又讯：大同及归绥两孤立城市的平绥铁路员工，不堪蒋傅匪帮压榨，纷纷逃来解放区。我“平绥铁路西段管理处”已收容七十余人，并均分配了适当工作。他们个个面黄肌瘦，衣履破烂。据谈：困守归绥的蒋傅匪帮，以无车可开，将铁路员工全部解散，青壮年被强迫编入“保警队”，年老者编担架队，驱迫他们当炮灰。已获解放的员工闻此，异常愤恨。
