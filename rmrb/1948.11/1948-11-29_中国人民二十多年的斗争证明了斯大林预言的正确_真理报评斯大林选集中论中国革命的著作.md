Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Telecommunication Agency, Moscow, 22nd: The development of the Chinese situation completely confirms Stalin's remarks on the Chinese situation, published twenty-two years ago and now timely reprinted in the ninth volume of Stalin's Selected Works. The latest volume (Volume 9) of Stalin's Selected Works contains Stalin's "The Question of the Chinese Revolution," "Conversation with Students of Sun Yat-sen University," "The Chinese Revolution and the Tasks of the Communist International," and other remarks on China. Stalin discussed the task of Chinese revolutionaries as ensuring the leadership of the proletariat and obtaining peasant reserves. Stalin exposed the attitude of the Chinese bourgeoisie towards the revolution, predicting that the Chinese bourgeois elements would quickly turn to the right and join the counter-revolutionary camp formed by Chiang Kai-shek (note: this refers to the merger of the Wuhan Wang Jingwei government and the Nanjing Chiang Kai-shek government in the later period of the Great Revolution of 1927). These proofs are very correct.

*Pravda*, in commenting on Stalin's views on the Chinese question, wrote: "Comrade Stalin's remarks on the position of the national bourgeoisie in colonial and dependent countries still retain all their great significance. The development of the Chinese situation proves that the Kuomintang reactionaries have long colluded with the mortal enemies of the Chinese people—American and British imperialists.” *Pravda* commented: “All of Comrade Stalin’s writings on the Chinese question are imbued with a deep belief in the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese proletariat and peasants who are growing up in the struggle. He foresaw that the Chinese anti-imperialist struggle would have a profound national and popular character and would continue to grow. The heroic sons and daughters of the Chinese people's struggle of more than twenty years against foreign imperialism and domestic reactionary traitors proves the correctness of Stalin's prediction and the inexhaustible power of the revolutionary masses.” Stalin pointed out: "Of great importance to the Chinese revolutionary democratic forces is the establishment of their own armed forces, an army that will not stop halfway, will not docilely obey the Kuomintang generals, but will march to the end in the struggle to win the anti-imperialist revolution." The newspaper concluded: "Comrade Stalin's theoretical works played a huge role in the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party and the formulation of the party's program and strategies at various stages of the revolutionary movement. These writings have provided the leaders of the Chinese people with a powerful spiritual weapon in the long years of heroic struggle to liberate the Chinese people from the shackles of imperialism and the oppression of domestic traitors."

　　中国人民二十多年的斗争
    证明了斯大林预言的正确
    真理报评斯大林选集中论中国革命的著作
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】电通社莫斯科二十二日电：中国情势的发展，完全证实了斯大林廿二年前所发表的、而现在适时地重刊于斯大林选集第九卷中的关于中国形势的言论。斯大林选集最新一卷（第九卷）中，有斯大林的“中国革命问题”，“与中山大学学生的谈话”，“中国革命与共产国际的任务”以及其他关于中国的言论。斯大林论述中国革命者的任务，在于确保无产阶级的领导权及取得农民后备军。斯大林揭露中国资产阶级对革命的态度，预言中国资产阶级分子会迅即向右转，并参加蒋介石所组成的反革命阵营（按：这是指一九二七年大革命后期，武汉汪精卫政府与南京蒋介石政府的合流）。这些证明都是非常正确的。
    真理报在评论斯大林对于中国问题的论点时写道：“斯大林同志这些关于殖民地及附属国民族资产阶级立场的言论，目前仍保有其全部伟大的意义。中国情势的发展证明：国民党反动集团早就勾结了中国人民的死敌——美、英帝国主义者。”真理报评称：“斯大林同志关于中国问题的一切著作，均灌注着对于在斗争中成长的中国无产阶级和农民所进行的革命斗争的深刻信念。他预见到中国反帝国主义的斗争，将具有深切的民族与人民的性质，且将不断增长。中国人民的英勇儿女们反对外国帝国主义及国内反动卖国分子的廿余年斗争，证明了斯大林预言的正确性和革命群众无穷尽的力量。”斯大林指出：“对中国革命民主力量具有巨大重要性的，就是建立他们自己的武装力量，一支不会中途停止，不会温顺地服从国民党将领，而是在争取反帝国主义革命运动之胜利的斗争中进军到底的军队。”该报结语称：“斯大林同志的理论著作，在中国共产党的建立，和制订党的纲领及革命运动中各个不同阶段的策略上，起了巨大的作用。这些著作给中国人民的领袖们，在为中国人民大众从帝国主义的束缚及国内卖国分子的压迫下争取解放而英勇斗争的悠长岁月中，提供了一个强有力的精神武器。”
