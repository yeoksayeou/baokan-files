　　Accelerate the Uprooting of the Scourge of the Shanxi People
  　Tens of Thousands of Laborers in the Jinzhong New District Fully Support the Liberation War

　　[Report from this newspaper] The people of the Jinzhong New District, recently liberated, have launched an enthusiastic movement to support the front lines, providing all available manpower and material resources for the war to liberate Taiyuan, which will also be the final liberation of Shanxi. This area was the longest and most cruelly ruled by the bandit阎 (Yan Xishan), and before liberation, it was a place of plunder for Yan's anti-people war. According to investigations in Yongkang and Zhangqing villages in Yuci, people had to spend at least twenty days a month building fortifications and gun emplacements for Yan. Guo Yucheng from Zhangqing said: "Yan Xishan not only took the grain, but also forced you to build gun emplacements on an empty stomach every day. You could barely move seven or eight days a month at home. Even if you were too hungry to move, they would say you were pretending." The number of young and middle-aged men who were conscripted is impossible to calculate. According to statistics from Zhang Huaying Village in Taiyuan County alone, 79 people were conscripted from a village of over a hundred households. Since liberation, the people have been overjoyed and demanded that our army quickly take Taiyuan and uproot this scourge of the Shanxi people. They shouted the resounding slogans: "Take Taiyuan Pass, capture Yan Xishan alive!" "Take Taiyuan City, liberate all of Shanxi!" Therefore, the people in this new district began preparing all the materials to support the front lines as early as June and July this year, immediately after liberation, and organized large convoys, stretcher teams, etc. As soon as the sound of artillery to liberate Taiyuan was heard, tens of thousands of laborers from the new district quickly mobilized. Liu Sanke from Yuci City had his grain seized by Yan's bandits. After liberation, the People's Government allocated food rations to him. When he heard that Taiyuan was about to be attacked, he volunteered to go, saying that this battle was for himself, and he had to go. The laborers in the Fourth District of Taigu all volunteered to participate in the war after speaking out about their suffering and signed contracts with the village, saying that they would never return home until Taiyuan was taken, and they would capture Yan Xishan and let him see the weeds growing in the fields. Zhao Sixiao, a laborer from Yuci, carried five boxes of ammunition alone when the troops captured Qiucun and they were sending ammunition to a certain place. He said that he was willing and able to carry more because Yan Xishan would have forced him to carry at most one box. After recounting the suffering of Yan's bandits who had conscripted his two brothers into the army and forced him to build fortifications for Yan, his morale was even higher. Only two laborers from the three new districts of Pingyao fell behind this time. A responsible comrade from the Logistics Command said: "In the past, Yan's bandits forced them to build fortifications and gun emplacements, and they were always dragging their feet and trying to escape. This time, they all volunteered to participate in the war and their morale is very high. Our past underestimation of the people in the new district was a mistake."

　　加速拔掉山西人民的祸根
  　晋中新区数万民工全力支援解放战争
    【本报讯】解放不久的晋中新区人民，已展开了热烈的支援前线运动，把一切人力、物力拿出来供给了解放太原也就是最后解放山西的战争。这一带曾是阎匪统治最久而且是最残酷的地区，在未解放前是阎匪进行反人民战争的掠夺场所。据榆次永康、张庆等村调查，人民给阎匪修工事炮台每月至少得二十天。张庆郭玉成说：“阎锡山把粮食要走，还得逼住你每天饿着肚给修炮台，一个月家里顶多能动弹七八天，你本是饿的不能动，人家还说你是伪装”。青壮年被抓走的更无法计算，仅据太原县张花营村统计，百余户一个村庄被抓者即达七十九人。自解放后，人民欢欣莫名，要求我军很快打下太原，把山西人民的这个祸根拔掉。他们喊出了“打下太原关，活捉阎锡山！”“打下太原市，解放全山西！”的响亮口号。所以此地新区人民早在今年六七月份，甫告解放之日起，即开始准备一切支援前线的器材，并组织了大车队、担架队等。当解放太原的炮声打响后，×万新区民工即很快出动了。榆次城刘三科，阎匪曾把他的粮食抢走，解放后人民政府给他调剂了口粮，这次他听说要打太原，他自动报名非去不行，说这战是给自己参，还能不去。太谷四区民工，经过了诉苦后，都自动报名参战，都和村里订了合同，说不打下太原，永不回家，非捉住阎锡山叫他看看地里长的那蒿草不行。榆次民工赵四小，当部队打下秋村，他们往某地送弹药时，他一人就扛了五箱，他说我自愿就能多扛，阎锡山要逼住我顶多扛一箱。他把阎匪抓走他两个兄弟当兵及他给阎匪修工事的苦诉了后，情绪更高。平遥三个新区民工这次只有两个掉队者。后勤指挥部某负责同志说：“阎匪在以前逼着他们修工事炮台，每天是磨洋工不想干逃跑，这次参战却都是自动报名，而且情绪很高，我们过去对新区人民的过低估计是错误的。”
