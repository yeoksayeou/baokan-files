Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 14th: China's last autocratic dynasty, the Chiang Kai-shek government, is sinking from history like a broken ship. Although Chiang Kai-shek is completely despondent, he is still determined to fight to the end. Chiang Kai-shek's so-called fight to the end means that he is unwilling to surrender and would rather have his remaining two million or so troops wiped out. Even so, the day is not far off when the People's Liberation Army will eliminate all the reactionary troops. In the first four months of the third year of the war, the Kuomintang has already lost one million troops, of which about 500,000 were lost in October. About 400,000 were lost in the Northeast. The disaster in November will not be lighter than in October. The collapse of the Xuzhou battlefield and the annihilation of hundreds of thousands of troops are now awaiting the Kuomintang. More importantly, the loss of Xuzhou is equivalent to the loss of the entire area north of the Yangtze River, which is equivalent to the loss of the last backbone of the Kuomintang army. Therefore, the Kuomintang is struggling hard. When Chiang Kai-shek pretended to generously hand over the command of North China to Fu Zuoyi and the command of Wuhan and Xuzhou to Bai Chongxi, he saw that the area north of the Yangtze River was finished and planned to withdraw his direct lineage to the south of the Yangtze River. But his plan is already too late to realize. Whether on the southern or northern front, Chiang Kai-shek has no complete battle line. The points of Taiyuan, Baoding, Chengde, Datong, and Gui Sui on the northern front have long been unable to connect with each other. The connection between Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou is also frequently disrupted. The same is true on the southern front. The three major centers of Xuzhou, Hankou, and Xi'an are no longer a battle line. These are just three strongholds and three piles of troops placed near these three strongholds, which of course do not form a battle line. South of the Yangtze River, the Kuomintang's battle line has not yet been established and cannot be established. Faced with this situation, not only Chiang Kai-shek's entourage, but even Chiang Kai-shek himself, are extremely pessimistic. The Shanghai publication "News World," published on October 16, stated: "Chiang Kai-shek returned to Peiping from Shenyang. Upon hearing of the fall of Jinzhou, he was extremely grieved and convened a military conference to seek 'survival from desperation.'" Other news stated that after the annihilation of Liao Yaoxiang's army corps in western Liaoning, Chiang Kai-shek vomited blood in Peiping and continued to vomit blood after returning to Nanjing. After returning to Nanjing, Chiang Kai-shek was facing the critical situation in Xuzhou on the one hand, and the critical situation on the economic front, especially the grain situation, after the collapse of the Gold Yuan notes and price controls on the other. The price of rice in Shanghai rose from 80 Gold Yuan per shi to 1,800 Gold Yuan in one week. The rice shortage in Nanjing caused 100 rice shops to be looted in one day. The post of President of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing has been vacant since Weng Wenhao resigned, and no one dares to take it. The dignitaries in Nanjing are preparing to flee to Guangdong, Guangxi, and Taiwan, and are discussing moving the capital to Guangzhou. Li Zongren, He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, and others are working to force Chiang Kai-shek to "step down." In order to prepare for the next step and seize the leadership of "anti-Chiang," some elements of Chiang Kai-shek's direct lineage have also participated in this activity. Liu Butong, a special agent "Legislative Yuan member" known as the official opposition, publicly wrote an article advocating that Chiang Kai-shek go abroad and "restore peace." Their purpose is to use "peaceful" methods to preserve some strength for the reactionaries. Therefore, their activities, which are contrary to the struggle of the people against the counter-revolutionary civil war, have not been prohibited. But Chiang Kai-shek is not willing to accept their suggestions at this time. Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech on the 8th, saying: "My personal attitude in doing things in my life is that once I start something, I will definitely strive for success; I will not easily assume any responsibility, and once I assume it, I will definitely be responsible to the end." This means that you want me to step down, but I don't want to step down. Chiang Kai-shek comforted his subordinates, saying: "Although the military failure in the Northeast this time, the foundations of politics, economy, and military affairs in the interior have not been shaken in the slightest. Compared with the strength of the Communists, we still have the advantage." This is just lying. Chiang Kai-shek's political, economic, and military foundations have fundamentally collapsed, and his so-called "advantage" no longer exists.

### 中国最后专制王朝濒临覆没　蒋介石绝望中还要蛮干到底

　　中国最后专制王朝濒临覆没
  　蒋介石绝望中还要蛮干到底
    【新华社陕北十四日电】中国最后一个专制王朝蒋介石政府，正在象一只破船一样地从历史上沉没。蒋介石虽已完全绝望，仍然决定要打到底。蒋介石所谓要打到底就是他不愿投降，宁愿将他现在还剩下的二百几十万军队打光。就令如此，人民解放军消灭全部反动军队的日子已经不远了。战争第三年的头四个月，国民党已经丧失一百万军队，其中约有五十万是在十月份丧失的。约有四十万丧失于东北。十一月份的灾难不会比十月份轻。徐州战场的崩溃，数十万军队的覆没，现正等待着国民党。而更重要的，则是丧失徐州等于丧失整个长江以北，等于丧失国民党军队的最后脊骨，因此，国民党正在努力挣扎。当蒋介石假装慷慨地把华北的指挥权交给傅作义，把武汉和徐州的指挥权交给白崇禧的时候，他是看到长江以北已经完了，打算把自己的嫡系撤退到长江以南去。但是他的计划已经来不及实现。南线和北线，蒋介石都没有什么完整的战线了。北线的太原、保定、承德、大同、归绥诸点早已互相不能联结了。北平、天津、唐山、张家口诸点的联结亦时被破坏。南线也是如此，徐州、汉口、西安三大中心已经不成一条什么战线。这只是三个据点及在这三个据点附近摆了三堆军队，当然不成什么战线了。长江以南，国民党的战线还没有建立，并且是建立不起来的了。对于这种形势，不但蒋介石的左右，而且连蒋介石自己在内，无不极度悲观。十月十六日上海出版的刊物“新闻天地”称：蒋介石由沈回平，闻锦州失守，极度悲痛，召开军事会议，谋求“死里求生”。其他消息称：辽西廖耀湘兵团全军覆没后，蒋介石在北平吐血，回南京后又连续吐血。蒋介石回南京以后，一方面是面对着徐州的危急情况，另一方面是面对着金圆券和限价崩溃后经济战线特别是粮食的危急情况。上海的米价一周内由每石八十金元涨到一千八百金元，南京的米荒使十日一天内一百家米店被抢。南京行政院长一职自翁文灏辞职后至今无人敢就。南京的要人们纷纷准备向两广及台湾逃难，并谈论着迁都广州的问题。李宗仁、何应钦、白崇禧之流正在活动着逼迫蒋介石“下野”。为了准备下一步，为了夺取“反蒋”的领导权，蒋介石嫡系中的某些分子也参加了这个活动。被称为官方反派的特务分子“立法委员”刘不同，公开著文主张蒋介石出国并“恢复和平”。他们的目的是想用“和平”的方法替反动派保留下一些力量，因此他们的活动，与人民反对反革命内战的斗争所遭遇者相反，并未受过禁止。但蒋介石现在还不愿接受他们的建议。蒋介石在八日发表演说称：“我个人平生做事的态度是一件事不开始则已，一开始就一定要求其成功；任何职责不轻易担任，一经担任就决定负责到底。”这就是说，你们要我下台，我是不想下台的。蒋介石安慰他的部下说：“这次东北军事虽然失败，但在关内政治、经济、军事各方面的基础丝毫没有动摇。与共匪实力比较，仍然居于优势。”这只是在说谎。蒋介石的政治、经济、军事各方面的基础，根本上已在崩溃，他的什么“优势”已经不存在了。
