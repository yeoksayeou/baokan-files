Letter from the Huolu County Committee to the Editorial Department

Comrades of the Editorial Department:

After reading the article "How to Conduct Criticism and Self-Criticism, as Seen from Handling the 'Huolu Relaxes Leadership in Production' Manuscript," we feel that many of the opinions are very valuable and will inspire us to more deeply examine ourselves and further improve our leadership. We are very grateful for this. At the same time, your cautious attitude in handling the issue is also something we should learn from. We have no objections to the argument that "Huolu relaxes leadership in production." In the second letter to the editors, we have already reviewed many shortcomings, and this basically reached a consensus when Comrade Sun Zhen came to our county. However, there are a few other points that we would like to raise again here in order to clarify the issue in a fact-based manner.

One, the second letter from the County Committee to the editors in late September was discussed and agreed upon by the entire County Committee. We hope that some issues should be based primarily on the content of that letter, and we hope that the letter can be published in the newspaper. If it is not to be published, we hope that this letter can be published.

Two, the news published on August 2nd was titled: "Without Investigation or Understanding the Situation, Huolu Abandons Production Leadership." This title is the basic point of contention between us and the reporter. Our opinion is that Huolu has shortcomings in production leadership, but we have not fundamentally abandoned leadership over production. Although our investigation work was not done well, we did conduct some investigations. We have already expressed to Comrade Sun Zhen that we did not do enough in production work and did not grasp it tightly enough. Therefore, the dispute is not "the reporter said that Huolu relaxed production leadership, and the County Committee said that it did not relax production leadership." We still think it is more appropriate to keep the original title in the newspaper, changing "relaxed" to "abandoned."

We believe that the title is a conclusion of fact. Of course, this is a specific difference of opinion. In order to enable both parties to conduct self-criticism more humbly, it is still necessary to clarify the matter, and we still need to reiterate some issues.

1. Regarding the issue of meeting time: The reporter said that the meeting lasted for a month, but we held two meetings in fifty days, totaling twenty-three days. These two meetings exceeded the time designated by the District Committee by a total of four or five days, according to the District Committee's instructions. The first meeting was from June 9th to 22nd. We believe this meeting was very necessary. From the land reform and party rectification until this meeting, the thinking of cadres in our county was extremely chaotic. There was widespread suspicion, and even dissatisfaction, with the land reform and party rectification. The District Committee instructed (and the County Committee also agreed) that in order to clear up the cadres' thinking and achieve consensus in understanding, it was absolutely necessary to hold this meeting. The meeting was very fruitful (Comrade Hu Kaiming of the District Committee also told the County Secretary that it was successful), and it played a great role in stabilizing the cadres' emotions. Furthermore, all departments came back from meetings at the Special Commissioner's Office, and production, summer requisition, primary school rectification, and public security armed reorganization were all deployed at this meeting. Although the meeting exceeded the time designated by the District Committee, it increased the above content, reduced the round trips of district cadres, and saved a lot of time.

The second meeting was from July 18th to 24th. The County Committee was very hesitant about this meeting. Because the first meeting was held not long ago, and the content was largely the same, although the County Committee members who came back from the District Party Committee meeting repeatedly said that the higher authorities instructed that it must be held, they also asked the District Committee again before holding it, and did not push the responsibility onto the District Committee. Of course, we should have tried to make the meeting better and shorter, but we must implement the instructions of the higher authorities.

It is not possible to explain the problem simply by saying "the reporter said that the meeting lasted for a month, and the County Committee said that it lasted for twenty-three days."

2. Regarding the allocation of production cadres, this issue was also reviewed in the last letter to the editors: "The leadership has shortcomings in the timely allocation of cadre promotion and training, and there are also difficulties. Because Huolu, except for two districts that are semi-old areas, the others are all new areas, and the cadres have no foundation. Most of the cadres in the land reform are from outside, and they are transferred back to their original departments after the land reform is over. In addition, the continuous output and insufficient promotion and training have led to a long-term unsoundness of cadres. However, compared with other departments, the number of production cadres is not small." In addition, it was also explained that the establishment of the Industry and Commerce Section was seven people, and only one person was missing at the time. Except for the first district, which did not have a cadre establishment, two districts were missing Industry and Commerce Assistants in the other nine districts. However, the reporter wrote that "the Production Guidance Department is empty, and the Industry and Commerce Assistants in each district are sometimes there and sometimes not," which is inconsistent with the facts.

3. The reporter said: "In many villages, the land of conscripted laborers was not planted in time." In the past few months, our county has not found anything affecting the production of conscripted laborers, and the leadership has paid attention to this issue. After the reporter raised this issue, the County Committee asked the reporter where the material came from and which areas it mainly referred to, in order to check. At that time, Comrade Bai Qing said that it was what the seventh district chief said, mainly referring to Wujiazhuang. The County Committee immediately sent people to the district and village to investigate. They learned that the district's laborers had only been conscripted once, this spring. The second expedition had not yet set off. When they set off this spring, it was the lunar new year, which was not yet the time to cultivate and plant the land. When the laborers returned to the district, it had not rained for the first time (the laborers in other districts returned in the wheat harvest, the first batch returned twenty days earlier, including the laborers in the seventh district), and it only rained for the first time after they returned, so it did not affect the planting of the land. At the same time, a total of five villagers from Wujiazhuang went to work, and four households did not lack labor at home and cultivated the land on their behalf. The other household lacked labor and cultivated the land on their behalf as much as possible; moreover, none of the land was left uncultivated, and the laborers expressed satisfaction when they returned.

Therefore, based on the above situation (the reporter did not go to any other districts at all), to say that "in many villages, the land of conscripted laborers was not planted in time" is completely unfounded. We believe that simply writing that the County Committee said "that's not the case" cannot clarify the "right" and "wrong" of the matter.

4. Regarding the fact that the County Committee only intended to devote half of its time to leading production in May, and this had not been implemented by the end of August. It is true that this was proposed in May, and in reality, not that much time was spent on production work (the central work was affected). However, after the meeting in June, the leadership shifted to production with all its strength. In late June, they launched a crash campaign to weed young seedlings and kill locusts; in early July, they prevented drought and prepared for famine. By mid-July, the county had generally entered the work of preventing drought and preparing for famine. After the second rain, in August, all districts in the county made every effort to rush to replant and weed seedlings. From then until the autumn harvest and wheat planting, the county and districts used the main cadres and main forces to carry out this series of production tasks, even affecting other work. For example, the statistics from the logistics department and other departments were delayed in the county in August (this is of course also wrong). Therefore, we believe that "this policy had not been implemented by the end of August" is not quite appropriate.

5. Regarding the issue of uncultivated land left in many villages, the total land area of our county is 652,016 mu (the previous writing of 689,520 was wrong). Before the second rain, there were 875 mu of uncultivated land, and 805 mu were planted after the rain. Taking the examples of uncultivated land in the sixth and seventh districts cited by the reporter, the seventh district has a total land area of 34,453 mu, with 50 or 60 mu of uncultivated land; the sixth district has a total land area of 103,790 mu, with two qing of uncultivated land. To say "a lot of uncultivated land was left in many villages" in this way, is it somewhat exaggerated? The problem of dry land in Licun Village is also different from what the reporter reported. The reporter said it was two qing, but after investigation, the village distributed land twice: after the first distribution, there were 600 mu left, which was distributed again (but the land ownership was not finally determined), leaving 60 mu. After the rain, part of it was planted, leaving only 14 mu of uncultivated land. At the same time, the reporter reported this five days after the rain, which was also the period when the crash replanting began (it was too wet to plant in the previous days). Moreover, after the rain, our county rushed to plant, and only 70 mu of land were left unplanted in the entire county (according to reports from various districts). To draw the conclusion that "a lot of uncultivated land was left in many villages" is somewhat out of touch with reality and somewhat exaggerated.

Three, we believe that the opinions on the reporter in the last article are correct. This is not only necessary for journalists, but also for all cadres when they go to understand the truth of a problem. In particular, we should patiently go deep into the masses, examine the problem in many ways, make precise analysis, compare and verify, and draw conclusions from it in order to solve the problem correctly. If we act rashly, chase shadows, and deal with problems one-sidedly without analysis and research, it will lead to irresponsible consequences for the people.

Comrades Guangming and Bai Qing did indeed provide us with a lot of help when they came to our county, but there were indeed some problems in the reflections that were not comprehensive, not true, and not objective. This was mentioned in the last letter to the editors. In this article, we feel that we should make more reviews from some specific issues. For example, in the article "Huolu Abandons Production Leadership," the reporter began by saying, "The reporter visited the responsible persons of the Huolu County Party and government and the two district offices of the first and seventh districts on the third day after the rain, and went to the countryside to conduct on-the-spot investigations of agricultural production. From the materials obtained in the past few days..." We believe that this is not in line with the facts. After the reporter came to our county, he only spent one and a half days looking at the materials stored in the County Committee (such as the number of livestock deaths and the number of uncultivated land), talking with the head of the Industry and Commerce Section and the director of the Promotion Society, spending one night in the Seventh District Office (three or four li away from the County Committee residence), and going to the city (First District Office) once, and then wrote "in the past few days" or "personally went to the countryside to conduct on-the-spot investigations of agricultural production," which is not in line with the style of seeking truth from facts. For example, in the second report on livestock deaths in Huolu, there is also a sentence "visited several villages," but in fact, the two reporters only learned about the materials from talking with the county and district cadres, and went to Nanguan and Dujiazhuang villages, but there was no problem of livestock deaths in the village. In order to maintain the seriousness of the Party newspaper, we feel that this style should be changed.

### 获鹿县委给编辑部的信

1948-11-30
第4版()
专栏：

　　获鹿县委给编辑部的信编者同志：
    我们看过“从处理‘获鹿放松生产领导’稿件来看应如何进行批评与自我批评”一文后，觉得有很多意见是很宝贵的，将会启示我们更深刻的检讨自己，促使我们进一步的改进领导，这是很值得感谢的。同时，你们对问题处理的慎重态度，也深值得我们学习。“获鹿放松生产领导”的论点，我们没有什么意见。在第二次给编者的信中，我们已经检讨了许多缺点，这在孙振同志来我县时，已经基本上取得了一致。但另外有几个意见，为了实事求是把问题弄清，我们还愿意在此再提一下。
    一、县委九月下旬第二次给编者的信，是经过县委会的讨论，取得全体县委同意了的，我们希望有些问题应该主要以那封信的内容为根据，并希望能将那封信在报纸上发表，如不公布时，我们希望能将这一封信予以发表。
    二、八月二日报上所登载的新闻，标题为：“不做调查、不摸情况，获鹿放弃生产领导”。这个标题是我们与记者争论的基本点。我们的意见是获鹿生产领导上是有缺点的，但我们还不是根本放弃了对生产的领导；虽然我们的调查工作作的不好，但是也还是进行了调查的。对生产工作作的不够好，抓的还不够紧，这在孙振同志来时，我们即已向他表示过。因此，所争论的并非“记者说获鹿放松生产领导，县委说没有放松生产领导”。报社这篇文章的标题，我们意见仍按报上原标题比较合适，把放松改为放弃。
    我们认为标题是事实的结论，当然这是个具体问题的分歧，为了能够使双方都更虚心的进行自我批评起见，还有必要把事情弄清，有些问题我们还必要重复说明一下。
    １、关于开会时间的问题：记者说开了一个月，但我们在五十天中开了两次会，共是二十三天，而这两次会按照地委指示共超过四五天。第一次是六月九日至二十二日，这次会我们认为是很必要的。自从土改整党以后至这次会前，在我县干部思想中是极混乱的，普遍对土改整党怀疑，甚至表示不满，地委指示（县委也同意）为了打通干部思想，取得认识上的一致，完全必要开这一次会。此次会的收获很大（地委胡开明同志也曾向县书表示过是成功的），对稳定干部情绪起了很大作用的。并且各部门都从专署开会回来，生产、夏征、整顿小学、公安武装整组，都是在这次会议中布置下去的。虽然会期超过了地委指定时间，但却增加了以上的内容，减少区干部的往返，节省了许多时间。
    第二次会是七月十八日至二十四日，这次会议县委非常犹疑，由于开过第一次会不久，且内容上大致相同；因此虽然从区党委开会回来的县委一再说上级指示一定要开，但也又请示了一次地委后才开的，并非把责任推到地委身上。当然，我们应该更想法子把会开的更好，时间更短，但上级的指示我们是必须执行的。
    如果仅以“记者说开了一个月，县委说开二十三天”，是不能把问题说明的。
    ２、关于生产干部的配备，这个问题在上次给编者的信中也检讨过：“在干部提拔、培养及时配备上，领导方面是有缺点的，亦有困难，因为获鹿除两个区为半老区外，其他皆为新区，干部没有基础，土改中的干部多为外来干部，土改结束后即调回原部门，加上不断的输出及提拔培养的不够及时，故形成干部长期不健全。但生产部门与其他部门相比较，生产干部不少”。另外，也曾说明实业科干部编制是七人，当时只缺一人；区里实业干部除一区编制上没有外，其他九个区缺两个区。但记者写为“生产指导部空无一人，各区实业助理员时有时无”，这与事实是不相符的。
    ３、记者说：“不少村庄出征民工土地未及时种上。”民工的生产，几个月来，我县尚未发现其受影响的事情，领导上对此问题也还注意。记者提出这个问题后，县委曾问过记者材料从何处得来，主要指的哪些地区，以便检查。当时柏青同志说是七区区长所谈，主要指的武家庄。县委即派人前去该区、该村调查，了解该区民工只出征过一次，即今年春季；第二次远征并未出发。今春出发时是旧历正月，还不到养种地的时候，该区民工回来时，尚未落第一次雨（其他各区的民工是麦夏回来的，第一批早回来二十天，其中就有七区民工），回来后才下第一次雨，不致影响到种地问题。同时，武家庄村民工共去五个人，有四户家里不缺劳力，也都代耕了，其他一户缺乏劳力，代耕最多；而且都未荒地，民工回来还表示满意。
    因此根据以上情况（记者根本未到别的区），即都为“不少村庄出征民工土地未及时种上”，是毫无根据的。我们认为只写上县委说“不是那么回事”，是不能把问题的“是”与“非”说清楚的。
    ４、关于县委五月里才打算仅仅以一半的时间进行领导生产，直到八月底尚未贯彻。确乎这是在五月提出的，且实际并未以那样多的时间去作生产工作（中心工作影响）。但从六月召开会议以后，领导上即以全力转入生产中。六月下旬曾突击锄小苗、打蝗；七月初防旱备荒，至七月半，全县已普遍进入防旱备荒工作中。第二次落雨后，八月全县各区都以全力突击补种锄苗，一直到秋收种麦，县区都是以主要干部主要力量进行了这一连串的生产任务，甚至使别的工作受到影响。如后勤部的数字统计及其他部门的数字统计，都在八月份压在县里未发下去（这当然也是不对）。因此，“至八月底尚未贯彻这一方针”，我们认为还不够十分恰当。
    ５、关于不少村庄遗留白地的问题，我县共土地数是六五二○一六（前写六八九五二○是错的）亩地，第二次雨前荒地八七五亩，雨后种上八○五亩。就记者所举六、七区荒地例子来说，七区共土地三四四五三亩，有荒地五、六十亩；六区土地共一○三七九○亩，荒地两顷。这样就说“不少村庄遗留白地很多”，是不是有些言之过甚？立迁村的旱田问题，也与记者所报导不同，记者说是两顷，但经过调查，该村共分地两次：第一次分后，剩下六○○亩，又分一次（但未最后确定地权），乘六○亩，雨后种上一部，只剩一十四亩荒地。同时，记者报导时，正是雨后五天的时候，也正是开始突击补种时期（前几天因为地里太湿不能下种），且我县经过雨后抢种，全县仅剩七十亩地未种上（据各区报），即得出结论说：“不少村庄遗留白地很多”，是有些不够切合实际的，未免有些过于夸大。
    三、最后这篇文章中对记者的意见，我们认为是正确的，这不仅对新闻工作者必要，对一切干部在他去了解一个问题的真象时都是很必要的，特别是对我们更应该耐心的深入群众，多方面的去考查问题，精密的分析，比较对证，从中得出问题的结论来，以便正确的解决问题；如果草率从事，捕风捉影，片面的不加分析研究的处理问题，将会造成对人民不负责任的恶果。
    光明、柏青二位同志到我县来，的确对我们有不少的帮助，但也确有些问题的反映是不够全面，不够真实，不够客观的。在上次给编者的信中已经谈到这一点，在此文中我们感到应该更多的从一些具体问题上去进行检讨。比如记者在“获鹿放弃生产领导”一文中，开始说“记者雨后第三天走访获鹿县党政负责人，及一、七区两个区公所，并赴乡村实地考查农业生产情形，从数日来所获材料看”这一段，我们认为是不符事实的。记者来我县后，仅以一天半的时间看县委所存材料（如牲口死亡数及荒地数），并跟实业科长与推进社主任谈话，在七区公所（离县委住处三、四里地）过一夜，去了城内（一区公所）一趟，即写成“数日来”或“亲赴乡村实地考查农业生产情形”，是不合实事求是的作风的。又如第二篇报导关于获鹿牲口死亡一稿中，亦有“走访数村”一句，实际上，该二位记者只是根据和县区干部谈话中了解的材料，去了一趟南关和杜家庄村，但该村并没有牲口死亡的问题。为了保持党报的严肃性，我们感觉这种作风，是应该转变的。
