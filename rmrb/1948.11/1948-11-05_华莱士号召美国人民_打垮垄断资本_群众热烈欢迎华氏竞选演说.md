    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 1st: TASS reports: Wallace delivered a radio address in New Haven, Connecticut, an industrialized city, on October 27th, calling on the American people to first overthrow the power of monopoly capital. Wallace emphasized that unprecedented power is concentrated in the hands of a few monopoly capitalists, and pointed out that American politics and economy are controlled by bankers and military figures like Forrestal, Lovett, and Dulles, who are not elected. Wallace said: The Progressive Party's struggle against monopoly capitalists has forced Truman to use every means of appeasement. What Truman recently said, that the real danger to democracy comes from private companies, is absolutely correct. However, he did not name names; he dared not name names because Truman himself appointed monopoly capitalists to decisive positions in the government. Wallace emphasized that Truman is using Hitler's lying tactics to evade the responsibility he should bear for the actions of these monopolists at home. Truman broke the railway workers' strike, the miners' strike, and the meatpackers' strike. After each strike was broken, he delivered a moving speech against the Taft-Hartley Act. The bipartisan foreign policy that is pushing the country to the brink of war is presided over by people like Dulles, who ten years ago advocated appeasing Hitler and today ordered the release of Nazis. Wallace concluded: The people can defeat the war policy by overthrowing the power of American monopoly capitalists and nationalizing large banks, railways, and atomic energy.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 2nd: Various reports: The US election is being held today. Prior to this, the presidential candidates of the Progressive Party and the two reactionary parties, Democratic and Republican, had successively concluded their campaign speeches. Progressive Party presidential candidate Wallace returned to New York City on the 28th and 29th of last month to deliver campaign speeches, which were warmly welcomed by the audience. Tens of thousands of listeners bravely went to listen, regardless of the danger of terror and intimidation. When Wallace appeared on a street in New York on the 28th, 5,000 cheering workers broke through the police line and threw dollar checks at Wallace. According to a Telecommunications Agency report on the 29th: "Wallace will give twenty-one more speeches before election day. His radio speeches now reach an average audience of ten million people. These broadcast times are all bought with workers' donations."
    Meanwhile, the campaign activities of the two tools of Wall Street—Republican and Democratic presidential candidates Dewey and Truman—ended on October 30th. In the final stage of the campaign, the two parties broke their tacit agreement not to discuss foreign policy issues with voters and engaged in sharp mutual attacks. In his final speech, Dewey shamelessly attacked Truman's foreign policy as "wavering" and "appeasing the Soviet Union." Truman's strategy is still to "steal the Progressive Party's platform to deceive the American people" (in Wallace's words). In a speech in Chicago, Truman attacked the Republican Party, saying: "The same reactionary forces that supported Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo's reactionary forces are secretly undermining our democratic system through the Republican Party." The Telecommunications Agency pointed out: The defeated Truman is playing the role in Wall Street's two-party "democratic" campaign farce of counteracting Wallace from the side, painting himself with "radical" colors in order to create illusions among voters and divert votes from the Progressive Party.

    华莱士号召美国人民
    打垮垄断资本
    群众热烈欢迎华氏竞选演说
    【新华社陕北一日电】塔斯社讯：华莱士于十月二十七日在康涅狄格州工业发达的纽海文城发表广播演说，号召美国人民首先打垮垄断资本的力量。华莱士强调少数垄断资本家手中集中了空前的力量，并指出美国的政治与经济是操在福莱斯特尔、罗维特和杜勒斯这类银行家与军人的手中，他们并不是选举出来的。华莱士说：进步党对垄断资本家的斗争，迫使杜鲁门用尽一切拢络人心的手段。杜鲁门最近所说民主的真正危险来自私营公司，这说得完全对。但是，他没有说出名字来，他不敢指出名字，因为杜鲁门自己任命了垄断资本家担任政府中有决定意义的职位。华莱士强调说，杜鲁门由希特勒撒大谎的伎俩来逃避他对这些垄断资本家在国内的行为所应负的责任。杜鲁门破坏了铁道工人的罢工、矿工的罢工以及肉类工人的罢工，在每一次罢工被破坏之后，他又发表一次反对塔夫脱——哈特莱法的动人演说。把国家推动战争边缘的两党一致的外交政策，是杜勒的这类在十年前宣扬姑息希特勒，今天下令释放纳粹的人们主持的。华莱士结语称：人民能够用打垮美国垄断资本家的力量、将大银行、铁道和原子能收归公有的方法，来击败战争政策。
    【新华社陕北二日电】各方报导：美国大选于今日举行。前此，进步党及民主、共和两反两政党的总统候选人均先后结束其竞选演说。进步党总统候选人华莱士于上月二十八、二十九日重返纽约市作竞选演说，受到听众的热烈欢迎。成千成万的听众不顾恐怖与恫吓的危险，勇敢地前去听讲。当华氏廿八日出现于纽约某街头时，五千欢呼的工人曾冲破警察防线，纷以美元支票抛与华氏。据电通社二十九日电称：“华氏在大选日以前，还将作二十一次演说。他的广播演说听众现在平均达一千万人。这些广播时间都是用工人的捐款换来的。”
    同时，华尔街的一对工具——共和与民主两党总统候选人杜威与杜鲁门的竞选活动，已于十月三十日结束。在竞选最后阶段中，两党已打破其不向选民谈外交问题的默契，进行尖锐的互相攻讦。杜威在其最后演说中，无耻地抨击杜鲁门的外交政策为“举棋不定”，“姑息苏联”。杜鲁门的策略则仍是“盗窃进步党的政纲来欺骗美国人民”（华莱士语）。杜鲁门在芝加哥演说时曾攻击共和党说：“与支持过希特勒、墨索里尼与东条反动力量一样的反动势力，正通过共和党而暗暗地破坏我们的民主制度。”电通社对此指出：将遭失败的杜鲁门在华尔街演出两党“民主”竞选滑稽剧中所扮演的角色，就是从侧面来对抗华莱士，涂上“急进的”色彩，以吸引选民对他发生幻想，分散进步党的选票。
