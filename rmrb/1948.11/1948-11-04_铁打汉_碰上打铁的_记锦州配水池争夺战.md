Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhou Front, 1st. Frontline reporter reports: The battle for the North Water Reservoir in Jinzhou was one of the main battles in the Jinzhou Campaign. The water reservoir was located on the northern heights of Jinzhou City. The enemy had constructed a group of fortifications, with a cement white building as the center, overlooking the entire city. It was surrounded by layers of semi-permanent bunker groups, and hidden trenches crisscrossed. This was a major position on the periphery of Jinzhou. In addition to four infantry companies, the defending enemy also deployed an anti-tank gun company, a heavy machine gun company, and a rocket launcher platoon. The enemy chief, Fan Hanjie, even ordered "fight to the last man and the last gun." The arrogant enemy even wrote a line of huge characters on the white building: "The troops defending the water reservoir are iron men." However, this "iron man" met the ironsmith.

At dawn on the 12th, our assault team, led by heroic battalion commander Zhao Tang, braved enemy aircraft and artillery fire from three sides, and with courageous and agile movements, broke into a corner of the enemy's position in just five minutes. They repelled the enemy's continuous nine-hour frantic counterattack, seized and consolidated this forward position.

After breaking through the enemy's barbed wire, the warriors of the assault company followed the enemy's trenches, using the flashes of explosions to search for the enemy. Soldiers Luo Kaihua and Fan Xingao pounced on a bunker twice in a row, but were driven back by the enemy's grenades. When they pounced on it for the third time, the enemy's grenades were even denser. They grabbed the bombs thrown by the enemy and threw them back. Two bombs exploded just as Luo Kaihua released them, blackening his face and covering him with blood. He still kept picking them up and throwing them back. At this time, the enemy's mountain guns fired again. Fan Xingao, who was buried in the dirt kicked up by the shell, struggled out of the soil, covered in wounds, and rushed up again. New soldier Bai Xilin held the breakthrough alone with his gun, repelling five enemy counterattacks. New soldier Yao Naicheng, whose grenade throwing record in training was 55 meters, climbed near the cement bunker and threw more than 60 grenades at the enemy after his gun was damaged. The assault team repelled the enemy's counterattacks while advancing forward, occupying four small red houses forty meters in front of the white building.

At this time, two regiments of enemy reinforcements from the city rushed up. The battle became even more intense. The red houses were completely riddled with bullets. The heroic battalion commander, who had earned ten battle merits in two years, repelled six rounds of enemy counterattacks with only four platoons of troops at his disposal. On the road to the side and rear, the enemy drove up three armored vehicles. "All available light and heavy weapons follow me!" the heroic battalion commander called out, and led thirty-three warriors to immediately turn to the side and rear. Communist Party member Huang Peishan led the grenade throwing team out of the fortifications and charged forward. As soon as they turned past the red houses, they launched a fierce attack, and all kinds of weapons sounded like a storm. At this time, the anti-tank guns of the fraternal troops, which had been pre-ambushed on the road, also suddenly fired in unison. The enemy's first armored vehicle was set on fire, and the other two abandoned their infantry and turned around to run.

The enemy's counterattacks were fiercer each time, but they were all crushed by our heroic assault battalion. However, the battalion's combatants were becoming fewer and fewer, so all company and platoon cadres picked up submachine guns and light machine guns to defend the forward positions. The wounded warriors, in order to hold on to the positions they had seized, insisted on not leaving the front line, and continued to lie in the fortifications with their guns pointed at the enemy. They said, "As long as I have a breath, the enemy will not be able to come up!" When the ammunition was used up, they searched the enemy corpses for it. The busy medic, Bai Jinwan, bandaged the wounded and then picked up weapons to join the battle.

In this way, from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm, our assault battalion repelled thirty-three enemy counterattacks, four times our number, and held on to its existing forward positions. When our fresh troops were thrown into battle at dark, the "iron men" of the water reservoir were annihilated by what they exclaimed as the "army of the storm."

    “铁打汉”碰上打铁的
    记锦州配水池争夺战
    【新华社锦州前线一日电】前线记者报导：锦州市北配水池战斗是这次锦州战役中主要战斗之一。该配水池位于锦州市北高地，敌人构筑了集团工事，以洋灰白楼为中心，俯瞰全城，周围是重重的半永久性地堡群，隐蔽地里的交通沟纵横交错。这是锦州外围的主要阵地。守敌除了四个步兵连外，还调来了一个战防炮连、一个重机枪连和一个火箭炮排。敌酋范汉杰并下令“战至一人一枪”。妄自尊大的敌人，竟在白楼上写了一行斗大的字：“守备配水池部队是铁打汉”，可是，这个“铁打汉”却碰上了打铁的。
    十二日破晓，我突击队在英雄营长赵傥率领下，冒敌机及炮火的三面轰击，以勇猛矫捷的动作仅历时五分钟即插入敌阵地一角，击退敌人连续九小时的疯狂反击，夺得并巩固了这一前进阵地。
    突击连的勇士们打破敌铁丝网后，顺着敌人的交通壕，借着弹光找寻敌人。战士罗开华和范新高等接连两次扑上一座地堡，都被敌人扔过来的手榴弹打回来。他们第三次扑上去时，敌人手榴弹更密，他们就抓起敌人打过来的炸弹回击敌人。两颗炸弹在罗开华刚撒手时爆炸，烟熏黑了他的脸，鲜血满身。他还是不停地拾起来往回扔。这时，敌人山炮又打过来，被埋入炮弹掀起来的泥土下的范新高，从土里挣扎出来，满身负伤，又冲了上去。新战士白锡林单人独枪守住突破口，打退敌人五次反击。练兵中投弹纪录五十五米的新战士姚乃成，当他的枪打坏后，就爬到洋灰地堡附近，向敌人打了六十多个手榴弹。突击队就这样地一面打退敌人反击，一面向前发展，占领了白楼前四十米达的四座小红房。
    这时敌人从城内增援来的两个团冲上来了。战斗更加激烈。红房被打得完全透顶。两年来立了十次战功的英雄营长，以手边仅有四个排的兵力，打退了敌人六次的轮番反扑。在侧后的公路上，敌人开来了三辆装甲车。“一切能打响的轻重火器随我来！”英雄营长这样号召，并率领了三十三个勇士立即转向侧后。共产党员黄配山领着投弹组跳出工事，猛冲上去。他们一转过红房子就猛打起来，各种火器响成一片风暴。这时兄弟部队预伏在公路上的战防炮也突然齐发。敌人的第一辆装甲车被打得起了火，其余两辆扔下了步兵回头就跑。
    敌人的反扑一次比一次凶猛，但都被我英雄的突击营粉碎了。但该营的战斗员已越来越少，于是一切连排干部都拾起冲锋枪、轻机枪，坚守着前沿阵地。受伤的勇士们为了守住他们夺得的阵地，坚持不下火线，依旧爬在工事里用枪口对准敌人。他们说：“只要我有口气，敌人就上不来！”弹药打完了他们就从敌尸上搜寻。忙碌的卫生员白金万，裹好伤员后也拿起武器来参加战斗。
    就这样，从上午九时到黄昏六时，我突击营打退了四倍于我的敌人三十三次的反扑，坚守着既有的前进阵地。当我生力军于天黑时投入战斗后，配水池的“铁打汉”，就被他们惊呼为“暴风雨的军队”歼灭了。
