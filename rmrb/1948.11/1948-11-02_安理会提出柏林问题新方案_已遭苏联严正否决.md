Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: TASS reports: Since the Soviet representative reiterated at the Security Council meeting on the 15th that it would not participate in the so-called discussion of the Berlin problem, the representatives of the six "neutral countries" have played new "mediation" tricks. Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia presented his "American-made" solution at the Security Council on the 22nd, unilaterally demanding that the Soviet Union immediately lift traffic and trade restrictions between Berlin and the Western occupation zones, but suggested that the issue of the Western occupation zones of Berlin using the Soviet occupation zone German Mark be submitted to the four-power occupation zone governors for "discussion." This plan clearly violates the agreement reached by the four countries in Moscow on August 30, which stipulated that the lifting of traffic restrictions between Berlin and the Western occupation zones and the use of the Soviet occupation zone German Mark as the sole currency should be implemented simultaneously. This plan simultaneously supports the position of the United States, Britain, and France in undermining the Moscow agreement and attempts to use the Security Council as a shield to conceal their sabotage of the agreement. Soviet representative Vyshinsky pointed out at the Security Council on the 25th that the Security Council's acceptance of the discussion of the Berlin issue, which falls within the power of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, despite the Soviet Union's opposition, violates the United Nations Charter, and that the Argentine Foreign Minister's plan is a blatant violation of the August 30th agreement. The Soviet Union believes that strict adherence to the agreement is essential. For the above reasons, the Soviet delegation cannot agree to this plan. Due to the opposition of the Soviet Union, a permanent member of the Security Council, the plan ultimately failed to pass.

    安理会提出柏林问题新方案
    已遭苏联严正否决
    【新华社陕北三十日电】塔斯社讯：自苏联代表于安理会十五日会上重申不参加所谓柏林问题的讨论后，六“中立国”的代表又玩弄了新的“调解”花样。阿根廷外长布拉玛葛里亚廿二日在安理会上提出其“美国制”的解决方案，片面地要求苏联立即取消柏林与西占区间的交通和商务限制，但对柏林西占区使用苏占区德国马克问题，则建议交由四国占领区总督“讨论”。这一方案显然违背了四国八月三十日莫斯科业已达成的协议，即取消柏林与西占区间的交通限制及以苏占区德国马克作为唯一通货，应同时实施。这一方案同时支持了美、英、法三国破坏莫斯科协议的立场，并企图以安理会作为掩盖它们破坏协议的挡箭牌。苏代表维辛斯基二十五日在安理会上指出：安理会不顾苏联的反对而接受讨论属于外长会议权力范围的柏林问题，是违背联合国宪章的，阿根廷外长的方案是对八月三十日协议的公然违反。苏联认为，严守协议十分必要。基于上述原因，苏联代表团不能同意这一方案。由于安理会常任理事国苏联的反对，该方案卒未获通过。
