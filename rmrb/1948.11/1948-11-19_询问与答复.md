    Inquiries and Replies
　　Women Have the Right to File for Divorce, and the Government Should Approve it According to Law

    To the Editors:
    Our village, Xishimen Village in Xingtai County, is a village of over one hundred households, with most of the residents relying on business for a living. After the incident, more than forty men went out to do business, mostly in places like Peiping and Baoding. Due to the enemy blockade, there has been no news for more than ten years. Now, some of the women have filed for divorce. According to the Marriage Regulations, they can be divorced, but if they are allowed to leave, there is fear of causing a divorce trend in the village (as most are waiting to divorce) and dissatisfaction among the masses. From our county's perspective, this kind of thing is a common phenomenon. Some women, whose divorces were not approved after several attempts, even married others privately, resulting in many bigamy and adultery cases. What should be done? Please reply.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Xingtai County Government, Si Fukui, Du Sihui)

    Answer: Husband and wife have the obligation to live together. If the husband goes out to do business and there is no news for more than ten years, the man has not fulfilled his duties as a husband, and the wife has the democratic right to file for divorce. According to Article 17, Paragraph 4 of the Provisional Marriage Regulations of the former Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu Border Region, "If the person's life or death is unknown for more than three years," it is one of the conditions for divorce and should be approved. This is different from the divorce of military dependents: because soldiers are fighting on the front lines for the cause of the people's liberation, while businessmen are operating for their own profit. According to you, this kind of situation is a common phenomenon in Xingtai. If divorce is approved, there is fear of causing a divorce trend and dissatisfaction among the masses. In fact, women keeping a lonely vigil, leading to bigamy or adultery, should be appropriately resolved. Not only should the government not oppose women's divorce, but on the contrary, the government should publicize such laws. Because this kind of problem is still in the minority among the masses, it will not form a mass movement. Some parties involved may express dissatisfaction, but it cannot be generalized as "the masses are dissatisfied" because this is not harmful to the masses. On the other hand, if the government does not try to resolve it, leading some women to marry others privately, the government cannot be blamed for it. In particular, the occurrence of many "bigamy and adultery cases" further illustrates that the government should immediately find a way to resolve it. However, handling such cases should also be investigated and studied, and a cautious attitude should be adopted, and it should not be done hastily. After approving the divorce, the marriage policy should be explained to the masses to raise their awareness.

　　"Should Criminals Be Allotted Land?"

    Question: When determining land rights, should those sentenced to imprisonment be allocated land? Should those sentenced to three years and ten years of imprisonment be treated the same on land issues?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Chen Shiying, Yuanshi County)

    Answer: When people commit crimes and are sentenced to imprisonment by the government according to law, what is punished is the criminal behavior that disrupts social order and endangers the democratic rights of the people. Except for the death penalty, their right to survival is not revoked. Those sentenced to less than three years of imprisonment need to be provided for, and those sentenced to more than ten years of imprisonment also need to be provided for. Therefore, regardless of the length of the sentence, they should be given a share of land. Giving a share of land to prisoners is beneficial to the people: first, their families can provide food for them, saving the people this burden; second, it is convenient to encourage the prisoners' enthusiasm for production and facilitate the achievement of the goal of education and reform. This is the case in both new and old areas.

　　Who Should the Adopted Child Belong To? The Child's Opinion Should Be Solicited

    Question: During famine years, a child who went out begging was adopted by someone else. Now, the child's biological parents have found him and demanded his return, causing disputes between the two parties. Such things happen often. How should they be handled?
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Si Fukui, Xingtai County Government)

    Answer: Regarding the question of returning sons given away for adoption during famine years, from the government's point of view, children are the next generation of society, and it is fine no matter which family raises them. The biological parents have certainly fulfilled their obligation to give birth and raise them, but the adoptive parents have also fulfilled their obligation to save their lives. Both have some reason to want this child, and it is difficult for the government to make a judgment. It depends on the child's opinion. Children over about seven years old have the ability to express their simple opinions. Since both sets of parents love the child, they should respect the child's opinions. If the child wants to stay with the biological parents, the adoptive parents should not force him to stay; if the child wants to stay with the adoptive parents, the biological parents should not force him to return, because forcing him to stay or return is not good for the child.

    询问与答复
　　妇女有权提出离婚　政府应该依法批准编辑同志：
    我县西石门村是一百多户的村子，大部群众都依靠经商为生。事变之后，男人外出经商者有四十余人，大部都在平、保等地，因敌人封锁至今十余年音信全无。现有的妇女提出离婚，若按照婚姻条例是可以离异，但如果准其离开，唯恐造成该村离婚风潮（因大部都在等待离婚）与群众不满。象这种事，从我县说来还是一种普遍现象，曾有的妇女因数次离婚未经批准，竟私自与他人结婚，因而发生了不少重婚通奸案件，究竟该怎办，请答复。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（邢台县政府、司福魁、杜思惠）
    答：夫妻有同居的义务，如果其夫出外经商，十多年无音信，男方既未尽到为夫的义务，其妻有提出离婚的民主权利。依前晋冀鲁豫边区婚姻暂行条例第十七条第四款规定“生死不明，已逾三年者”为离婚条件之一，应予批准。这与军属离婚不同：因为军人在前方，为人民解放事业奋斗，商人则是为自己营利。据你们说，邢台这类情事，是一种普遍现象，如果批准离婚，怕造成离婚风潮与群众的不满。实际说，妇女守望门寡，以致造成重婚，或通奸等现象，更应当予以适当解决，不但不应反对女方离婚，相反的，政府应当宣传此种法令，因此种问题在群众中究竟还占少数，不会形成群众运动，可能有些当事人的家庭，表示不满意，但不能概括的说“群众不满意”，因为这对于群众没有害处。另一方面，如果政府不设法予以解决，以致有些妇女私自与他人结婚，政府也不能因此而加罪。特别是不少“重婚、通奸等案件”的发生，更说明政府应即予设法解决。但处理这种案件，也应加以调查研究，采取慎重态度，不应潦草从事。批准离婚后，更应向群众解释婚姻政策，以提高群众的认识。　　　　　（司法部）
　　“犯罪分子应否分地？”
    问：在确定地权时，被判处徒刑者是否应留地？判徒刑三年与十年者，在土地问题上是否同样待遇？　　
　　　　　　　　　　　　　（元氏县陈世英）
    答：人们犯罪经政府依法处以徒刑，所惩罚的是因为他们破坏了社会安宁秩序，危害了人民的民主权益的犯罪行为。除死刑外，并没有取消他们的生存权利。判三年以下的徒刑者，需要让他们生活，判十年以上的徒刑者，同样也要让他们生活，因此，无论判处徒刑期的短或长，都应分给他们一份土地。分给犯人一份土地，对于人民有好处没坏处：一是可由他家供给囚粮，免得人民多此一项负担，一是便利于督励犯人生产的积极性，便利于达到教育改造的目的，不论新区老区，都是如此。

　　义子该归谁家？应征求孩子的意见
    问：灾荒年间，讨饭出外之小孩，被他人收为义子，现在其亲生父母找见，要求领回，因此双方发生争执，象这样的事很多，应如何处理？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（邢台县府司福魁）
    答：灾荒年间把自己的儿子送人作养子，现在亲生父母要求领回的问题，如果站在政府立场来看，小孩是社会的后一代，无论归谁家抚养，都可以。亲生父母固然曾经尽过生养的义务，但养父养母也尽了救死的义务。他们谁要这个小孩，都有一部分理由，政府很难下判断。这就要看小孩的意见了。大概七岁以上的小孩就有表达自己简单意见的能力，双方父母既然爱护小孩，就应该尊重小孩的一些意见，小孩愿随亲生父母，养父养母就不应强作留难；小孩愿意跟着养父养母，亲生父母也不应该强要领回，因为强制留下或领回，对于小孩没有好处。
