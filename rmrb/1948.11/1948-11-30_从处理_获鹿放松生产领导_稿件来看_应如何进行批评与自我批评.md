This newspaper published a news item about Huolu relaxing production leadership this autumn. The Huolu County Committee sent two letters to appeal, which is very good. This newspaper also sent a special person to Huolu to investigate once. Publishing this article is intended to learn from the experience and lessons of this report and promote correct self-criticism in various places. Beforehand, it was sent to the Huolu County Committee for review. The county committee's opinions were detailed in a letter to the editor and are published together. These two materials were originally written a long time ago, but were delayed until now due to war preparedness and other reasons. It is hoped that readers in various places and the Huolu County Committee can still raise opinions for research and discussion on this report.
                                        —Editor

On August 2nd, this newspaper published a news article on the first page criticizing Huolu for relaxing production leadership. This was written by a reporter from this newspaper. The general idea is to criticize the Huolu leadership for abandoning production leadership, manifested in many meetings during the production period and "very few people left in the district"; less than half of the waterwheel loans issued during the drought prevention period were actually loaned to the districts; the phenomenon of livestock mortality was very serious; the county and districts failed to grasp the leadership of the masses in investigating and eliminating wasteland, resulting in many villages leaving a lot of barren land; some seedlings withered during the drought; the leadership did not pay attention to houses collapsing after the rain; the seed problem was not resolved in advance during the rush planting; the organization leading production was not sound, and there were too few cadres. The editor added a note at the end, believing that "this is the leadership method of empiricism and bureaucracy. If it cannot be corrected thoroughly, the work will not be able to move forward."

The county committee disagreed with the basic argument of this news article. Comrade Cao Weiping, the county secretary, wrote a letter to the reporter on August 7th, saying that "there are several issues in that news article that are very correct (such as the allocation of production cadres, the specific assistance to the masses in production, and the estimation of the seed problem this time)." But at the same time, he also said: "It is true that Huolu's production leadership is not good, and other work is not good. This is due to our weak ability. Subjectively, we have been working hard and paying attention (but not enough). We have not relaxed leadership."

In order to confirm this argument, Comrade Cao Weiping talked in detail about the situation of leading production and the achievements obtained: "As early as the first month of the lunar calendar, we convened a meeting of farmer representatives. When arranging the distribution of land, we discussed and arranged the work of delivering manure and spring plowing. We also put forward the slogan of holding meetings at night and producing during the day. Therefore, the manure this spring was sent out very early in some districts. None of the districts delayed planting early-maturing crops. In mid-March, we convened the second representative meeting and expanded cadre meeting to conduct in-depth discussions and arrangements. … In May, the prefectural committee held a production meeting, which clearly defined the principle of production work being the first priority. Since then, every cadre meeting and mass meeting has talked about production… In early June, when it rained, we immediately paid attention to drought resistance and famine preparation in early July. Comrade Zhou Ming (deputy secretary of the county committee) personally inspected the fields in the second, third, and fourth districts. On July 3rd, I went to the third, eighth, and ninth districts to see the drought situation. On the 6th, I personally helped the Beizhai village branch in the ninth district to make a drought resistance and famine preparation plan. Based on the experience of that village, I instructed the work of each district… Due to the tight grasp of leadership, drought resistance and famine preparation work has achieved great results." He then mentioned many specific achievements, such as dry planting, picking tree leaves, digging wells, and repairing waterwheels. The letter also stated: "Due to good mobilization work in advance, the masses enthusiastically replanted and rushed to plant after the rain and during the rain, creating a fever…". The county committee also had some different opinions on some specific facts in the news article. The county committee also wrote a letter to the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau, stating its opinions on that news article.

This newspaper studied the Huolu County Committee's letter and that news article and felt that there was a fundamental disagreement between the two sides. The reporter believed that Huolu had relaxed production leadership, while the county committee believed that "we have not relaxed leadership." In order to clarify the truth of the facts, a special person was sent to Huolu to investigate and study with the county committee and other county-level cadres and some district and village cadres. "Finally, at a symposium with more than ten people from the county committee and other county-level cadres, a roughly consistent opinion was reached."

On August 29th, the county committee wrote another letter to the editorial department of this newspaper, saying that the news article "gave us a great help and prompted us to further examine the county committee's leadership in production. There are indeed many shortcomings in our work, which deserve our redoubled efforts to overcome in the future." It also said: "The most important shortcoming in our leadership of production work is that there are more arrangements and calls than concrete help and supervision and inspection. The production tasks of each period can generally be arranged on time, but how to concretely help the district and village organizations to realize them is not enough. Moreover, there are fewer follow-up inspections. This has led to insufficient timely discovery of problems… Secondly, the research on production problems and the learning of production knowledge are poor. Although we have conducted investigations on some issues, they are mainly related to pure numbers, and we have failed to further study the issues and resolve them in a timely manner… Thirdly, the leadership has failed to mobilize all cadres from all departments ideologically, forming a situation in which some departments and some cadres do not pay attention to production work, emphasizing departmental work, and paying less attention to production work when going down, resulting in insufficient concentration of leadership power in production…". "In addition, we should also try our best to study how to better combine the central work with production work in the future. This is a problem that is not easy to solve at the grassroots level. The timeliness of the central work often swallows up production work…."

According to the county committee's second letter, there were more arrangements and less inspection and concrete help; lack of research and learning, and inability to discover and solve problems in a timely manner; lack of organization in work; these are the basic shortcomings of Huolu's production leadership. These shortcomings are the concrete manifestation of the "leadership methods of empiricism plus bureaucracy" mentioned in the editor's note in the news article. On this basic point, the county committee and this newspaper agree. Although there are still some specific facts on which the reporter and the county committee have not reached a consensus, for example: meeting time - the reporter said it lasted for a month, the county committee said it lasted for twenty-three days. Allocation of cadres in production departments - the reporter said: "The production guidance department of the promotion agency is empty, and the industrial assistants in each district are sometimes there and sometimes not." The county committee said: "The leadership has shortcomings and difficulties in the promotion and timely allocation of cadres... Compared with cadres in other departments, there are not many cadres in production departments." Seed problem - the reporter said: "The county committee once said it was a big problem," the county committee said: "The seed problem in the county is not big." Wasteland problem - the reporter said: "Many villages have a lot of wasteland left," the county committee said: "There were a total of 875 mu of wasteland before the rain, and 805 mu were planted after the rain. It is inappropriate to use the words 'many' and 'a lot'." Laborers cultivating land - the reporter said: "The land of the laborers who went to war in many villages was not planted in time." The county committee said: "That's not the case..." But these disagreements on specific facts did not affect the basic argument of criticizing Huolu for relaxing production leadership. The county committee said in its first letter: "Subjectively, we have been working hard and paying attention." This is an undeniable fact, and Huolu has indeed achieved a lot of success in production (see the news published in this newspaper on August 2nd and the excerpts from the county committee's letter above). However, the special investigators sent by this newspaper and the Huolu County Committee also discovered the following facts during their joint research: "The distribution of land was completed in each district around the end of February, and the county peasant representative conference was convened in March, proposing to take large-scale production as the center. However, at that time, it was necessary to concentrate efforts to engage in a series of urgent tasks such as expanding the army, correcting deviations, distributing floating wealth, publicizing the party's policies, stabilizing the masses' emotions, and spring conscription. In fact, the result of combining execution was that the center was helplessly transferred. The county committee proposed in May to spend 50% of the time leading production... The problem lies in the fact that this policy has not been effectively implemented until now (end of August - editor)... The main reason is that other temporary tasks contradict the annual central large-scale production work." As a result, they were "passively dragged into affairs." According to this situation, if we examine it from the actual situation, rather than from subjective wishes, it is very obvious that Huolu relaxed production leadership, and the county committee has also agreed.

After clarifying the truth of this matter, we would like to put forward a few more opinions for everyone to study and discuss:

1. In the past two or three months, our newspapers have begun to pay attention to criticism and self-criticism, which is very necessary. Criticism and self-criticism are the driving force for promoting all our work and the soul of the party newspaper. When the party newspaper stops criticism and self-criticism, it becomes weak, lifeless, and lacking vitality. It cannot become the party's weapon for uniting and leading the broad masses of the people in carrying out the liberation war and production. In the past, our criticism work was indeed not done well enough, especially the lack of criticism that was ideologically clear, sharp, and factually accurate. In the future, the party newspaper must strengthen criticism and self-criticism, and must strive to learn to criticize. The newspaper's criticism of the work of a certain region or department has no other purpose than to hope that the relevant parties can deeply examine, correct shortcomings, and improve work based on the spirit and facts of the criticism. We hope that any party, after being criticized by the newspaper, will immediately examine its own work and openly express its attitude in the newspaper: admit what is right and make corrections in actual work; those that are incorrect can be appealed and discussed to clarify right and wrong and improve work to be responsible to the people. In appeals and discussions, one should be objective, calm, and enthusiastic and sincere, affirm what is right, deny what is wrong, adhere to the truth, and correct mistakes. Some regions, after being criticized by the party newspaper, neither admitted and corrected, nor appealed or discussed, but adopted an attitude of resistance by "silence," and even said "strange things" behind their backs. This is an irresponsible attitude to the people and an undisciplined behavior.

Taking this criticism of Huolu as an example, it was at the time when a long drought met rain, and all regions should seize the opportunity to solve various difficulties for the masses and lead the masses to rush to plant to make up for the losses caused by the long drought. However, many regions at that time had relaxed production leadership; the newspaper sounded an alarm, Huolu paid attention, and afterwards sent a letter to the newspaper saying: "It gave us a great help and prompted us to further examine the county committee's leadership in production." Other regions have also made some changes as a result, proving that this criticism has played a completely positive and constructive role.

The Huolu County Committee saw the newspaper's criticism and immediately appealed its opinions to the newspaper and the Propaganda Department. This spirit is very good. However, in the first letter, we felt that the county committee had not considered the issue from the basic spirit of this criticism, and had not focused on examining its own leadership from the perspective of practical results, but had measured its work more from subjective wishes and planned arrangements. Therefore, some essential issues were neglected. For example, the meeting time was long, which is a fact. The county committee initially did not study how these meetings were held, whether there were any shortcomings of empiricism, and whether it could think of some ways to hold them well and short in the emergency of production, so as to learn some experience and lessons from it, but pushed the reason to the objective, saying "the prefectural committee asked to hold them" and so on, thus blocking its own in-depth examination.

Here, there arises the issue of the criteria for criticism. Should we examine the merits and demerits of the work from subjective motives, calls, arrangements, plans, etc., or should we examine it from objective effects and actual implementation? We are Marxists and Leninists, and undoubtedly we should examine it from the latter aspect. Therefore, even if every meeting discusses production and every instruction writes "everything for production," if there is no actual concrete organization and implementation, and no expected results are achieved, it cannot be said that you have leadership in production work, but can only prove that your leadership is "bureaucratic."

2. Reporters have written some critical articles recently, which is very good. We are correspondents of the people's party, and we must be responsible to the people and to the party. Therefore, we have the responsibility and obligation to expose and criticize all phenomena and behaviors that harm the interests of the people and hinder production and construction. However, in criticism, we must try our best to be truthful and comprehensive, and to be positive and constructive. Therefore, we must patiently go deep into the masses, collect materials from many aspects, analyze them meticulously, think repeatedly, and at the same time be bold in doubting, comparing and verifying, so as to ensure that not only are the facts accurate, but also that they are appropriate in proportion. The reporter's interview in Huolu this time was relatively rushed. The interviewees were mainly some county and district cadres (which is of course very necessary), but it was not enough to go directly into the countryside and investigate and verify with the masses. Therefore, it is difficult for the reporter to have absolute certainty about some specific facts that he did not hear and see personally. The reporter listed many specific shortcomings in Huolu's production leadership, but failed to sharply point out which one was the main one, and did not further pursue the ideological root causes of these shortcomings, and clearly point out the essence of the problem and the methods for improvement, making it difficult for people to see the main problem, thus weakening the guiding power and persuasive power of the report.

The reporter's criticism of Huolu this time also has incomplete aspects. For example, the county committee stipulated in its production plan in early July that "collection should be completed before July 10, and then shift to large-scale production." Among them, there is the sentence "everything for large-scale production." The reporter only excerpted the problematic two sentences and crossed out the last sentence. This excerpt will make readers think that the county committee did not even mention paying attention to production in its plan, which is obviously not the case. We should compare and analyze the basic spirit of the county committee's work plan with the actual implementation results, discover problems in a realistic manner, find the key, and try to point out the development trend of things and the methods for improving work. This is our work attitude and discipline, and we must pay attention to it. The Huolu County Committee raised some opinions to the reporter, such as being patient, meticulous, comprehensive, listening to the opinions of grassroots cadres, and understanding the thoughts and work situation of the interviewees, etc., all of which are valuable, and we should pay attention to remembering them.

3. Our editorial work is a work of possessing materials, analyzing research, criticizing, and processing. He has the responsibility and the right to express opinions on the things reflected in the news and to discuss them with the parties concerned. For this news about Huolu, the editor clearly and sharply raised the problems that the reporter failed to summarize in the editor's note, thus strengthening the guidance of this news, which is good and should be promoted. However, editors, in measuring a piece of news or a problem, especially need to be comprehensive, objective, and appropriate in proportion. For example, saying "abandon" leadership in the title seems to be too strong in tone. Because the county committee paid attention to production leadership subjectively, and in fact achieved a lot of success. The shortcoming is only that they did not grasp production leadership tightly and the methods were not quite right. It would be more appropriate if the title was "relax leadership."

　　从处理“获鹿放松生产领导”稿件来看
    应如何进行批评与自我批评
    今年秋天，本报发表了获鹿放松生产领导的消息，获鹿县委曾两次来信申述，这是很好的，本报也曾另派专人到获鹿去调查过一次。发表这篇文章，是想从此次报导中吸取经验教训，推动各地正确的进行自我批评；事前并曾寄给获鹿县委会阅过，县委的意见详给编者信中，特一同发表。这两个材料本来写好已经很久，因备战等原因，迟至现在才登出。希望各地读者及获鹿县委，对此报导如仍有意见，还可提出研究讨论。　　　　
　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    八月二日本报一版发表了一篇批评获鹿放松生产领导的新闻。这是本报记者写的。大意是批评获鹿领导机关放弃生产领导，表现在生产期间开会很多、“区上留人很少”；防旱期间所发水车贷款，各区实贷下去不足一半；死亡牲口的现象很严重；县区未能抓紧领导群众查荒灭荒，以致不少村庄遗留很多白地；天旱期间有的禾苗旱枯了；雨后塌了房子，领导上未及时注意；抢种时种籽问题没事先解决；领导生产的机构不健全，干部太少。编者在后面加了按语，认为“这就是经验主义和官僚主义的领导方法，如不能痛予纠正，工作将一步也不能向前推进”。
    对于这篇新闻的基本论点，县委并不同意。县书曹维屏同志于八月七日给记者写了一封信，说那篇新闻中“有几个问题很对（如对生产干部配备上，具体帮助群众生产上，及这次对种籽问题估计上）”。但同时又说：“获鹿生产领导的不好，其他工作也不好，是实事。这是我们能力弱的关系。在主观上检讨我们还是努力的，还是注意的（不过还不够）。我们是没有放松领导。”
    曹维屏同志为了证实这个论点，并详细的谈到领导生产的情形及获得的成绩：“我们还在阴历正月初，即召集了农民代表会议，布置分地的时候即讨论布置了送粪及春耕工作。还提出了晚上开会，白天生产的号召。所以今年春天的粪，有些区很早即送出去了。各区都没有耽误了种早收作物。三月中旬又召集第二次代表会与扩干会，作了深刻讨论与布置。……五月地委开生产会议，又明确了生产工作第一的方针。此后每一干部会与群众大会，没有不讲生产的………六月初旬下的雨，七月初我们即注意了抗旱备荒工作。周铭同志（县委副书记）亲往二、三、四各区田中检查。我七月三号到三、八、九区去看旱灾情形。六号到九区北寨村亲自帮助该村支部作抗旱备荒计划。并根据该村的经验，指示了各区工作………由于领导上抓得紧，抗旱备荒工作有很大的成绩。”下面说了不少具体成绩。如干种、采树叶、挖井、修水车等。信中又称：“由于事前动员工作好，雨后以及在下雨的当中，群众补苗抢种工作很踊跃，作成热潮………”。对于新闻中某些具体事实，县委也有一些不同意见。县委同时给中央局宣传部写信，申述自己对那篇新闻的意见。
    本报研究了获鹿县委的来信和那篇新闻，觉得双方意见是有根本的分歧。记者认为获鹿放松了生产领导，县委则认为“我们是没有放松领导的。”为了把事实真象弄清楚，于是派遣专人，赴获鹿调查，和县委及县级其他干部和部分区村干部在一起研究，“最后在县委及县级其他干部十余人的座谈会上，取得了大致一致的意见。”
    八月二十九日，县委又给本报编辑部来信，说那篇新闻“给我们很大的帮助，促使了我们更进一步的检查县委对生产的领导。确乎在我们工作上存在很多的缺点，实值得我们今后加倍努力克服。”又说：“我们在生产工作的领导上最主要的一个缺点，是布置号召多于具体帮助与督促检查，每一个时期的生产任务一般的都能按时布置下去，但如何具体帮助区、村组织实现是不够的。而且事后的检查也少的。致使对问题发现不够及时………其次是对生产问题的研究与对生产知识的学习差。虽然有些问题我们进行了调查，但那是属于单纯的数字较多，未能更进一步研究问题，及时解决………再其次，领导上未能把各部门全体干部从思想上动员起来，形成有些部门某些干部对生产工作的不重视，强调部门工作，下去时对于生产工作的注意即差，致使对生产领导力量不够集中………”。“除此之外，我们今后还应该尽量研究，作到中心工作与生产工作如何结合得更好。这是我们在下层不易解决的问题。常常因为中心工作的时间性而吞食了生产工作……。”
    照县委第二次来信看，布置多，检查和具体帮助少；缺乏研究与学习，不能及时发现与及时解决问题；工作中缺乏组织性；这是获鹿生产领导的基本缺点。这种缺点正是本报在新闻按语中所说“经验主义加官僚主义的领导方法”的具体表现。在这个基本点上，县委和本报的意见是一致了。虽然，还有一些具体事实，记者和县委还没有取得一致的意见，例如：开会时间——记者说开了一个月，县委说开了二十三天。生产部门干部配备——记者说：“推进社生产指导部空无一人，各区实业助理员时有时无。”县委说：“在干部的提拔与及时配备上，领导方面是有缺点、亦有困难……与其他部门干部比较，生产部门干部不少。”种籽问题——记者说：“县委曾表示很问题”，县委说：“全县种籽问题不大。”白地问题-记者说：“不少村庄遗留白地很多”，县委说：“雨前荒地共八七五亩，雨后种上八○五亩，用‘不少’、‘很多’字眼形容不妥当。”民工耕地问题——记者说：“不少村庄出征民工土地未及时种上。”县委说：“不是那么回事……。”但是这些具体事实的分歧，并未能影响批评获鹿放松生产领导的基本论点。县委第一次来信说：“在主观上检讨我们还是努力的，还是注意的。”这是不可否认的事实，而且获鹿生产也确乎有不少的成绩（见八月二日本报所载新闻及上面节录县委来信）。但本报派遣的专门调查人员和获鹿县委共同研究时，却也发现了如下的事实：“二月底前后各区都结束了分地，三月份即召开了县农民代表大会，提出了以大生产为中心。但当时又不能不集中精力去搞扩军、纠偏、分浮财、宣传党的政策、稳定群众情绪、春季征收等一系列的紧急任务。实际上结合执行的结果，故无可奈何的转移了中心。县委五月里提出以百分之五十的时间领导生产……问题在于这一方针直到如今（八月底——编者）未能切实贯彻下去。……主要是其他临时任务，与常年中心大生产工作存在着矛盾。”结果“被动的拖在事务里边。”依据这种情况，如果从实际上、而不是从主观愿望上检查，则获鹿放松生产领导已十分显然，县委也已同意。
    弄清了这件事情的真象以后，我们愿意再提出几点意见，供大家研究讨论：
    一、最近两三月来，我们的报纸开始注意了批评与自我批评，这是非常必要的。批评与自我批评是推动我们一切工作的动力，也是党报的灵魂，什么时候党报停止了批评与自我批评，什么时候它就变成软弱无力、暮气沉沉，毫无生气了，它就不可能成为党团结与领导广大人民进行解放战争与生产的武器。过去我们的批评工作实在还做得非常不够，特别是缺乏思想明确尖锐而又事实确凿的批评。今后党报必须加强批评与自我批评，而且一定要努力学会批评。报纸对某一地区或部门的工作提出批评，并无别的目的，只是希望有关方面能够根据批评的精神和事实，深入检查，纠正缺点，改进工作。我们希望任何方面在受到报纸的批评后，立即检查自己的工作，公开在报纸上表明态度：对的承认，并在实际工作中进行改正；不对的可提出申辩、讨论，把是非弄清，把工作搞好，对人民负责。在申辩、讨论时，应该客观冷静、而又热情诚恳，是则是之，非则非之，坚持真理，修正错误。有些地区受了党报的批评，既不承认改正，也不申辩、讨论，采取了以“沉默”来抵抗的态度，甚至在背后讲“怪话”，这是对人民不负责任的态度、也是无组织无纪律的行为。
    以这次对于获鹿的批评来说，当时正是久旱逢雨，各地亟应抓紧时机，给群众解决各种困难，领导群众抢种，以弥补久旱之后造成的损失。但不少地区当时对于生产领导是放松了的；报纸敲了一下警钟，获鹿注意了，事后给报馆来信说：“给我们很大帮助，促使了我们更进一步检查县委对生产的领导。”其他地区也曾因此有了某些改变，证明这种批评，完全起了积极、建设的作用。
    获鹿县委看到报纸的批评，马上向报馆及宣传部申述自己的意见，这种精神是很好的。但在第一次来信中，我们觉得县委还没有从这个批评的基本精神上去考虑问题，没有着重从实际效果上检查自己的领导，却较多的从主观愿望和计划布置上衡量了自己的工作。因此，对于某些本质问题就忽视了。譬如开会时间较长，这是事实，县委最初对于这个问题，不是研究这些会开得究竟怎么样，有没有经验主义的缺点，还能不能想些办法在生产紧急关头，开得又好又短，以便从中吸取一些经验教训，却把原因推之于客观，说“地委叫开的”等等，从而就阻塞了自己深入的检查。
    这里，就发生了一个批评标准的问题，究竟是从主观动机号召、布置、计划等等方面去考察工作的好坏呢，还是从客观效果、实际执行方面去考察呢？我们是马列主义者，无疑问的应当从后一方面去考察。因此，即使每次开会都讨论生产，每个指示都写了“一切为了生产”，如果没有实际的具体的组织执行，并收得应有效果，那也不能说明你在生产工作上是有领导的，而只能证明你的领导是“官僚主义”。
    二、记者在最近写了一些批评稿子，这是很好的。我们是人民的党的通讯员，要对人民、对党负责任，因此有责任、有义务揭发与批评一切妨害人民利益、妨碍生产建设的现象和行为。但在批评时，要尽量做到真实全面，而且是积极的带建设性的。因此就要耐心的深入群众，多方面搜集材料，精密分析、反复思考，同时要大胆怀疑，比较对证，作到不但事实确凿，而且切合分寸。记者这次去获鹿采访，时间比较仓促，访问对象主要是一些县区干部（这当然非常需要），但直接深入农村，向群众调查对证就比较不够，因此有些具体事实，记者没有亲闻目睹，很难有绝对正确的把握。记者列举了许多获鹿生产领导方面的具体缺点，但未能尖锐的指出到底哪个是主要的，没有进一步追寻产生这些缺点的思想根源，明确指出问题的本质及改进办法，使人不容易看出主要的问题，因而削弱了报导的指导的力量和说服的力量。
    记者这次对获鹿的批评，也有不全面的地方。例如县委在七月初订生产计划上，规定“七月十日前完成征收，十日后转入大生产。”其中有“一切为了大生产”的话，记者只摘录了那有毛病的两句，把后面这句勾掉了。这样节录，会使读者以为县委甚至在计划中也没有把注意生产提出来，这显然不是事实。我们应该把县委工作计划的基本精神和实际执行的结果对照起来分析研究，实事求是的发现问题，找出关键，并设法指出事情发展的趋势和改进工作的办法，这是我们的工作态度和纪律，必须注意的。获鹿县委对记者提出了一些意见，如应该耐心细致、全面、倾听下层干部意见，了解被采访者的思想与工作情况等等，都很宝贵，我们应该注意记取。
    三、我们的编辑工作是一种占有材料、分析研究、批判、加工的工作。他有责任和权利对于新闻中所反映的事物提出意见，和当事者共同商讨。对于获鹿这篇新闻，记者所未能概括的问题，编辑在按语中明确而尖锐的提出来了，从而加强了这篇新闻的指导性，这是好的，应该发扬的。但是，编辑衡量一篇新闻或一个问题，尤其需要全面客观与恰合分寸。例如，标题说成“放弃”领导，语气就显得重了。因为县委对于生产领导，主观上是注意的，而且实际上也获得了不少成绩。缺点只是对生产领导抓的不紧，方法上不大对头，如果标题为“放松领导”将是更恰当的。
