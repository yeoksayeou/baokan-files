　　Crushing the Enemy's Conspiracy to Flee South from Anyang
　　Taihang Local Armed Forces Create Glorious Battle Achievements
　　[Taihang, 7th dispatch] The Taihang Military Region Headquarters issued a commendation order on the 3rd, praising the local armed forces of the Fifth Military Sub-district, units XX and XX, for bravely resisting the enemy in Anyang who attempted to flee south, creating a glorious battle achievement with zero casualties on our side and 126 enemy casualties. Under the powerful momentum of our army's autumn offensive, the Kuomintang army's 39th Division stationed in northern Henan, Anyang, had dreamed of breaking through more than 200 li of the liberated area in late October and fleeing south to Xinxiang. On the 22nd, the 39th Division headquarters and the entire 116th and 117th Regiments (the 115th Regiment of the division had already been annihilated by us in Xixiaowucun, southwest of Huojia) combined with some bandits and fled to Zhangcunji, Dahuangzhuang, and Guxian areas east of Tangyin. After being head-on attacked by our local armed forces, their attempt to flee south was unsuccessful, and they were forced to return to Anyang in a panic on the afternoon of the 25th. After the failure of this attempt to flee south, the enemy became even more panicked internally. On the 31st of last month, the enemy's supervisory battalion and the Tangyin puppet People's Self-Defense Headquarters, totaling more than 600 people, stationed in Weijiaying, more than ten li south of Anyang City, feigned an attack on Yangjiajing and other places, vainly attempting to take the opportunity to escape south. This self-deceiving trick was seen through by us, and we laid a trap to prepare to annihilate the fleeing enemy. When the enemy advanced to the area between Yangjiajing and Xibucun, they were fiercely attacked by our local troops ambushing there, and the entire enemy was defeated in just 30 minutes of fierce fighting. A total of 106 enemies were captured, and more than 20 enemies were killed or wounded. The enemy fled back to their lair in a panic, and we suffered no casualties. This time, five light machine guns, 92 rifles, three Mauser pistols, and more than 4,000 rounds of various bullets were seized. The Taihang Military Region Headquarters specially issued a commendation order and encouraged them to continue their efforts in fighting bravely and to strive for the annihilation of all enemies in northern Henan and the liberation of all the people of northern Henan. Another telegram: In the operation to crush the enemy's conspiracy to flee south from Anyang's 39th Division from the 22nd to the 25th of last month, the militia of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th districts east of Tangyin actively cooperated with the local armed forces to launch a blocking and blasting war on the 60-li-long joint defense line. On the 22nd, the joint defense militia of Nanbeidianshang in the 6th district blocked the attack of more than 1,000 enemies at the Gaocun Bridge (south bank of the Tang River), half a li away from the enemy, and held the river defense position for more than two hours. The joint defense militia of our battalion and the eastern joint defense militia also blocked the invading enemy at the Mufo Bridge and Guxian Bridge for several hours, respectively, to protect the safe transfer of the masses and livestock. On the 23rd, the enemy's main force sneaked into Caiyuan and was killed and wounded by the mines buried by our militia ×7 people. At this time, the joint defense militia of each district in the 6th district cooperated with a part of the county battalion to take advantage of the enemy's main force advancing eastward to Caiyuan, chasing the enemy on one side and driving away the returning corps who remained in the villages to loot grain on the other. The Nanbeidianshang militia also captured an enemy soldier.
