Xinhua News Agency, North China, 9th. Our compatriots in the United States are suffering from economic exclusion, racial discrimination, and persecution by American imperialists. According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao: There are approximately 100,000 Chinese compatriots in the United States, the vast majority of whom are distributed in the five major cities of New York, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. In these cities, they live in narrow, dirty areas called "Chinatowns" and are mostly engaged in occupations such as laundry, grocery stores, and restaurants, making it difficult to find other work. They do not enjoy freedom of residence and are frequently summoned and subjected to various restrictions. Properties owned by overseas Chinese outside of "Chinatowns" are often forced to be sold and relocated. Chinese students are also subjected to various forms of discrimination. American students can find work in their spare time to supplement their living expenses, but Chinese students are often prohibited from working by regulations such as "students cannot work," and often cannot find housing because of their "yellow skin." Furthermore, Chinese entering the country face even more difficulties and persecution. "Chinese entering the country, especially the poor, are easily detained by the Immigration Bureau and sent to a small island outside San Francisco, sometimes forgotten and left there as prisoners." In late September of this year, a Chinese woman, Liang Biguo, who was detained in the Immigration Bureau, committed suicide in protest against the unbearable torture. This summer, a Chinese female student who arrived in the United States became pregnant and was about to give birth, but was also detained. Currently, a large number of "Chinese people who cannot live and cannot die are enduring long nights of suffering" in the immigration bureaus of San Francisco and New York islands.

The Kuomintang traitorous government is indifferent to the various insults and persecutions suffered by overseas Chinese. "For example, this spring, an overseas Chinese was beaten and injured for no reason in Philadelphia and was also arrested and imprisoned, resulting in his death in prison. The Chinese side not only did not demand compensation or punishment, but did not even make a superficial protest." On the other hand, the Kuomintang government does its best to exploit the hard-earned money of overseas Chinese. When overseas Chinese remit money back to China through the Kuomintang's Central Bank of China, they suffer greatly from the difference between the "official rate" and the black market rate (for example, if overseas Chinese remit US$10,000 back to China through the aforementioned bank, they can currently only receive 40,000 counterfeit gold yuan, which are constantly depreciating, but on the Shanghai black market on October 30, US$10,000 could be exchanged for 200,000 counterfeit gold yuan, meaning that four-fifths was plundered).

### 我国留美十万侨胞备受美帝歧视迫害

　　我国留美十万侨胞备受美帝歧视迫害
    【新华社华北九日电】我国留美侨胞备受美帝国主义者的经济排斥、种族歧视与迫害。据天津大公报透露：我留美侨胞约十万人，绝大多数分布在纽约、波士顿、芝加哥、旧金山和洛衫矶五大城市。他们居住在上述城市中又窄又脏被称为“中国城”的地区，多以洗衣、开杂货店、饭铺等为职业，很难找到其他工作。他们居住毫不自由，经常受到传讯和种种限制。侨胞在“中国城”以外地区所置产业，时常被迫变卖和迁移。中国留学生同样受到种种歧视，美国学生可以在课余找工作贴补生活，中国学生就时常被“学生不能工作”的规令来禁止工作，并常常因为“黄皮肤”的缘故，找不到房子。至于华侨入境更受留难和迫害，“入境的中国人，尤其是贫苦人民，动不动被移民局扣留，送到旧金山外一小岛上去，有时就被忘记了，一直摆在那里做囚犯”。今年九月下旬，一个被扣留在移民局的中国妇人梁碧国因不堪折磨愤而自杀，今年夏天有一个抵美的中国女学生怀孕临产，也被拘留起来。目前在旧金山、纽约各岛移民局还扣留着大批“求生不得、求死不能的中国人民，正还忍受着长夜如年的磨难”。
    国民党卖国政府对于华侨所遭受的种种凌辱和迫害不闻不问，“比如今年春间，一个侨民无故在费城被人打伤了，还被抓进牢，以致在牢里死去。中国方面不但没有要求赔偿抵罪，连面子上的抗议也未做”。另一方面国民党政府却尽量剥削华侨的血汗所得，华侨经过国民党中国中央银行汇款回国，要大大吃“官价”黑市之间的亏（例如华侨经过上述银行汇美元一万元回国，目前只能得到日趋贬值的伪金圆券四万元，但在十月三十日的上海黑市上，一万美元可兑伪金圆券二十万元，即被掠夺去五分之四）。
