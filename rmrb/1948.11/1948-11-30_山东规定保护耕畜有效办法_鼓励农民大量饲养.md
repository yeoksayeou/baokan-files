Xinhua News Agency, East China, 28th: Encouraging farmers to breed and raise draught animals to overcome the severe shortage is a crucial task for realizing "one inch more in production" in all rural areas devastated by war. In the vast rural areas of Shandong, the number of draught animals has fallen to less than one-half or even one-third of pre-War of Resistance levels due to the long-term occupation and destruction by the Japanese invaders and the devastation and slaughter during the Kuomintang bandit army's key offensives. The lack of correct policies on the draught animal issue has exacerbated this situation. The various biases mentioned in this agency's September 25th short commentary "Protecting Draught Animals," such as neglecting the interests of draught animal owners in corvée labor, requisitioning, and land reform, have occurred in the Shandong liberated areas as in other liberated areas. These biases include: irrationally increasing the burden on livestock-raising households in corvée labor and substitute labor, instead of rationally averaging the burden based on labor; neglecting the ownership and usage rights of livestock-raising households, unilaterally catering to the cultivation difficulties of households lacking cattle, and forcing mutual use of cattle in violation of the principle of voluntary equivalence; directly or indirectly forcing farmers to collectively raise cattle in production labor exchanges; and erroneously using the presence or absence of draught animals as a criterion for determining class status in class demarcation. Left-leaning errors on the draught animal issue have increased farmers' concerns about raising draught animals and hindered the rapid recovery of draught animal populations.

The CCP East China Central Bureau has repeatedly emphasized the importance of protecting and rewarding the breeding and raising of draught animals in its recent instructions on production and disaster relief, and has criticized biases that infringe upon the interests of livestock-raising households. The current situation shows that in areas where this instruction has been earnestly implemented, draught animal populations have increased significantly. For example, seven counties in the Luxzhongnan area had increased their livestock by more than 10,000 heads before the autumn harvest, and the Xihai sub-district of Jiaodong has also successively purchased more than 8,000 heads. However, many areas have not yet earnestly implemented this instruction, so the number of draught animals increased is far from the minimum required for production. Based on this actual situation, the Party and government leading organs in the Shandong liberated area are further promoting policies to protect and breed draught animals. The Shandong Provincial Government recently promulgated "Provisional Measures for Protecting and Rewarding the Breeding of Draught Animals," stipulating that all livestock used for agricultural cultivation, regardless of size, will be subject to a reduction of 15 jin of public grain and 22.5 jin of public grass per head per year; breeding female animals will be exempt from corvée labor in addition to the reduction of public grain and public grass; young animals and nursing mothers will be exempt from corvée labor or heavy corvée labor according to regulations, and the government will provide draught animal loans, etc., to encourage farmers to raise draught animals.

The Shandong Dazhong Daily, in its editorial "Protecting Draught Animals, Breeding Draught Animals," in addition to elaborating on the measures promulgated by the provincial government, also addressed the past biases that infringed upon the interests of livestock-raising households and proposed four principles for protecting the interests of livestock-raising households: (1) The ownership and usage rights of livestock must be resolutely protected, and no one may force the borrowing of cattle without the consent of the livestock-raising household. (2) In the hiring of draught animals and the exchange of animal power, the principles of fairness, mutual benefit, equivalent exchange, and mutual voluntariness must be observed. When determining the standard for the exchange of draught animal labor, the specific local conditions should be considered, the consumption of raising draught animals and the cultivation capacity of draught animals should be studied in detail, the local farmers' habits of hiring and borrowing draught animals at that time should be taken as a reference, and the villagers' meeting should discuss and stipulate fair and reasonable cattle labor prices or methods of exchanging human labor for cattle labor. The cattle grass and cattle labor accounts in past labor exchanges and mutual aid should be settled and cleared as soon as possible this winter, and there should be no more arrears. (3) The free hiring and borrowing of draught animals should not be prohibited. (4) The necessary obligatory cultivation for the families of soldiers, workers, martyrs, and working staff should be shared equally by each village according to labor, and the tasks of supporting the front should also be fairly and reasonably assigned, correcting the past bias of increasing the burden on households with draught animals in requisitioning. The editorial pointed out that in order to develop animal husbandry on a large scale, the government should make full use of uncultivated grasslands and mountains and vigorously organize, promote, and help people operate pastures. Farmers who protect and reward the breeding of breeding stock should be protected and rewarded, their social status should be raised, and the old society's contempt for them should be changed. The original methods and good experiences in rural areas that are supported by farmers should be brought into play to organize farmers to raise cattle together, but errors such as deviating from reality, forcibly organizing the masses to raise cattle in rotation, or forcing individually raised cattle to become collectively raised cattle should be prevented. The individual raising of cattle by farmers should also be promoted and helped. The editorial stated that the current season is the season for farmers to add and exchange cattle, and it is necessary to seize this period to mobilize farmers to purchase draught animals and exchange unsuitable draught animals, pay attention to preventing the phenomenon of slaughtering draught animals, and help the masses solve the difficulties in feeding draught animals in winter, especially the difficulty of fodder. In this regard, the most active way is to organize winter transportation, and farmers should be encouraged to use draught animals for winter transportation to solve the difficulty of cattle grass according to the specific situation. In areas where cattle grass is scarce, livestock-raising households should be organized to prepare fodder for feeding draught animals in winter, paying attention to preserving cattle grass or harvesting green grass.

**Provisional Measures of the Shandong Provincial Government on Protecting and Rewarding Draught Animal Breeding**

Article 8: All draught animals (cattle, horses, mules, donkeys) are strictly prohibited from being slaughtered, and those who violate this provision shall be subject to penalties. If slaughter is necessary due to old age or disability that prevents them from cultivating, it must be discussed by the village farmers' association and reported to the district government for inspection and approval before slaughter is permitted. Those who deliberately create injuries or attempt to slaughter draught animals to seek profit shall be punished by the government above the district level after verification.

Article 9: The draught animals used to cultivate land on behalf of military families, workers' families, martyrs' families, and honorary soldiers must be discussed by the masses, reasonably calculate the labor, and be borne by the whole village.

All previous measures issued by this government and various administrative offices related to protecting and breeding and raising livestock that conflict with these measures shall be invalidated and shall be handled in accordance with these measures. (Xinhua News Agency, East China, 25th)

Editor's Note: The Shandong Provisional Measures for Protecting and Rewarding Livestock are an important measure to overcome the current serious shortage of draught animals. All localities should earnestly study them, combine them with the ongoing winter production, encourage farmers to purchase and breed livestock in large numbers, stipulate specific measures to protect the interests of livestock-raising households, so as to quickly change the shortage of livestock and make full preparations for the large-scale production movement next year.

　　山东规定保护耕畜有效办法
  　鼓励农民大量饲养
    【新华社华东二十八日电】鼓励农民繁殖与饲养耕畜，以克服严重的耕畜缺乏，是一切受过战争摧残的农村中实现“生产长一寸”的切要工作。山东广大农村中的耕畜，因受日寇长期侵据破坏及国民党匪军重点进攻时的摧残宰杀，现存数目已不及抗日战争前的二分之一，甚至三分之一。对于耕畜问题缺乏正确的政策，曾经加重了这个情况的严重性。本社九月二十五日“保护耕畜”短评中所说的在支差、变工、土地改革中忽视耕畜主人利益的种种偏向，在山东解放区也象其他解放区一样地发生过。这些偏向就是：支差代耕中不按劳力合理平均负担，而一味加重养畜户的负担；忽视养畜户的耕畜所有权与使用权，片面照顾缺牛户的耕种困难，违反自愿等价原则强迫互用耕牛；在生产变工中直接或间接强迫农民伙养牛；在划阶级中错误地以有无耕畜为订成份的标准等。耕畜问题上的左倾错误，增加了农民饲养耕畜的顾虑，与迅速恢复耕畜的困难。
    中共华东中央局在今年来的历次关于生产救灾的指示中，均曾反复强调保护与奖励饲养耕畜的重要，并批评了侵犯养畜户利益的偏向。现在的情况表明：凡认真执行了这一指示的地区，耕畜已有显著增加。如鲁中南区的七个县，秋收前已增加牲口万余头，胶东的西海分区也相继买进八千余头。但还有不少地区，尚未认真执行，以致耕畜增加的数目，距生产需要的最低限度还很远。根据这一实际情况，山东解放区党政领导机关正进一步来推行保护与繁殖耕畜的政策。山东省政府最近颁发了“保护与奖励繁殖耕畜暂行办法”，规定凡从事农业耕作的牲畜不分大小，每头每年减征公粮十五斤，公草二十二斤半；配种的母畜，除减征公粮公草外，得酌免差役；幼畜与带犊的母畜得按规定免除差役或重差役，政府贷放耕畜贷款等，以奖励农民饲养耕畜。
    山东大众日报在“保护耕畜、繁殖耕畜”的社论中，除了阐述省政府所颁布的这个办法以外，并针对过去侵犯养畜户利益的偏向，提出了四项保护养畜户利益的原则：（一）要坚决保护养畜的所有权与使用权，非经养畜户同意，任何人不得强迫借用耕牛。（二）在耕畜雇用与畜力换工中，要遵守公平两利、等价交换与双方自愿等原则。在确定耕畜换工的标准时，应根据当地具体情况，详细研究饲养耕畜的消耗与耕畜的耕种能力，参考当时当地农民雇借耕畜的习惯，由村民会讨论并规定公平合理的牛工价格，或人牛换工的办法。对过去变工互助中牛草牛工帐目，应当抓紧于今冬结算找清，不能再有拖欠不给的现象。（三）对耕畜的自由雇借不应禁止。（四）对解放军军人家属、工作人员家属及烈士家属之必要的义务代耕，应由各村按劳力平均负担，对支前任务也应公平合理分派，纠正过去支差中加重有耕畜户的负担的偏向。社论指出：为了大量发展畜牧事业，政府应当尽量利用未开垦的草地、山林，大力举办并提倡与帮助人民经营牧场。应当保护与奖励饲养种畜的农户，提高其社会地位，改变旧社会对他们的鄙视态度。应当发挥农村中原有的为农民所拥护的方式与好的经验，组织农民伙养牛，但应防止脱离实际、标新立异地强迫群众伙养轮喂或强迫独养牛变为伙养牛的错误办法。对于农民独养牛亦应加以提倡和帮助。社论称：目前正是农民添牛、换牛的季节，必须抓紧这个时期，动员农民添购耕畜与调换不适用的耕畜，注意防止宰杀耕畜的现象，帮助群众解决在冬季喂养耕畜中的困难，首先是饲料的困难。在这方面，最积极的办法是组织冬季运输事业，应根据具体情况，鼓励农民把耕牛用于冬季运输以解决牛草困难。在牛草缺乏的地方，应组织养畜户准备冬季喂养耕畜的草料，注意保存牛草或收割青草。

    第七条、凡本解放区之耕畜（牛、马、骡、驴），一律禁止贩往国民党统治区，违者交县以上政府处理，按其情节轻重没收其所贩耕畜或科以罚金。
    第八条、凡耕畜（牛、马、骡、驴）一律严禁宰杀，违者酌予处罚。如因齿老残疾不能耕作必须宰杀者，须经本村农会讨论，呈报区政府查验批准，方许宰杀。对故意制造伤疾、企图宰杀耕畜从中谋利者，经查实后，交区以上政府惩处。
    第九条、凡给军、工、烈属及荣誉军人代耕之耕畜，均须经群众讨论，合理计工，全村负担。
    第十条、本办法自公布之日起施行之。凡本府及各行政公署所颁发之有关保护及繁殖、饲养牲畜之各种办法与本办法有抵触者，一律作废，均依照本办法办理。（新华社华东二十五日电）
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：山东保护与奖励牲畜暂行办法是克服目前耕畜严重缺乏的一个重要措施，各地应认真研究，结合正在进行的冬季生产鼓励农民大量购买繁殖牲畜，规定具体办法保护养畜户的利益，以便迅速改变牲畜缺乏情况，给明年大生产运动作充分准备。
