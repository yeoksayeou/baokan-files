【Taihang News】Under the active leadership of Taihang labor hero Li Shunda (village party secretary), who consistently implemented the principles of more hoeing and more fertilization, Xigou Village in Pingshun achieved a bumper harvest of autumn crops. The masses are extremely jubilant. The entire village, consisting of twenty-two households and one hundred and twenty-one people, harvested sixteen shi and nine dou of grain and one hundred and eighty-nine dan of yams from hillside land; the one hundred and ninety-five mu and five fen of flat land yielded three hundred and seventy-four shi and five dou and five ge of grain, thirty-nine dan of yams, and one hundred and nineteen dan of radishes and vegetables. When converted, this exceeded the expected yield by one hundred and fourteen shi and one dou and nine ge, with an average yield of more than one shi and nine dou of grain per mu. For example, Li Shunda's nineteen mu of flat land and fifteen mu of hillside land yielded a total of forty-eight shi and nine dou of grain, thirty cloth bags of yams, and more than forty dan of radishes and vegetables. This year's bumper harvest is primarily attributed to the correct leadership of labor hero Li Shunda and all the party member cadres. Li Shunda has consistently and resolutely believed in the Party's production policies. This spring, when cadres and masses in various regions experienced ideological confusion, he continued to complete his five-year construction plan, influencing the cadres and masses throughout the village, reversing everyone's thinking, and reassuring them to focus on production. His leadership style has also undergone significant changes, becoming more democratic and enthusiastic, as reflected in his leadership of both the village's work and his family's production. Lu Wenquan, chairman of the Farmers' Association, and Wang Zhouze have also changed their past undemocratic style, becoming popular among the masses and becoming new labor heroes and models. Under their leadership, party members have gone deep into mutual aid teams to take the lead in production, truly embodying the goal of all party members uniting the masses to produce and become prosperous. Second, getting organized leads to prosperity. Based on the past organization and experience, the village truly implemented the principle of combining mass demands with voluntary participation. All households in the village were organized, adhering to the principles of labor exchange, equivalent exchange, flexible division of labor (large tasks concentrated, small tasks dispersed), fair work valuation, and timely account settlement. Men and women all went to work in the fields, creating an atmosphere of unity and enthusiastic production throughout the village. Third, technical guidance was implemented throughout the year. At the time of sowing, the wide-ridge planting method for grains was widely promoted, three hoeings were generally carried out, and jade maize was top-dressed with fertilizer (more than one hundred shi per mu). After the hail disaster, the village organized the supporting of seedlings and the trimming of leaves, reducing losses by 20 percent. Fourth, short-term plans were formulated for each season, completed on schedule, and timely checked and summarized. Heroes and models were selected, commended, and rewarded. The enthusiasm of the masses was seized, and one movement after another promoted production work. Fifth, long-term plans were closely linked with short-term plans. Without long-term plans, production is blind; without short-term plans and regular checks, long-term plans will fail. Fourteen households in the village have formulated five-year plans for prosperity. During the gaps in agricultural production, other production and preparations are to be carried out. For example, during the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, there are plans to collect stones and make adobe bricks in preparation for building and repairing houses.
    Now, a winter production plan has been formulated to prepare fuel and engage in sideline occupations, in preparation for building houses and repairing fields next spring.
    Comrade Li Shunda himself, after the five-year production and development plan formulated in the spring of 1946 through a family meeting, has basically achieved it through two and a half years of effort by the whole family. The remaining thirteen families who have formulated five-year production and development plans are working hard to catch up under the positive influence of Shunda. (Chang Qun, Xiao Cheng, Man Hui)

　　在李顺达和全体党员领导下  逐段计划讲求技术　西沟全村喜庆丰收
    【太行讯】平顺西沟村在太行劳动英雄李顺达（村支书）积极带头、贯彻始终的领导下，多锄多上肥，全村秋禾达到丰收。群众极为欢腾。全村二十二户，一百二十一口人，坡地收粮十六石九斗，山药一百八十九担；平地一百九十五亩五分，收粮三百七十四石五斗五，山药三十九担，萝卜菜一百一十九担，折算起来，超过了应产量一百一十四石一斗九，平均每亩收粮一石九斗多。如李顺达十九亩平地，十五亩坡地，总收粮四十八石九斗，山药三十布袋，萝卜菜四十多担。这个丰年的获得，首先是劳动英雄李顺达和全体党员干部的领导正确。李顺达一贯坚决地相信党的生产政策。在今春各地干部群众思想混乱时，仍继续完成他的五年建设计划，影响全村干部群众，扭转了大家思想，安心生产。他的领导作风也有了很大转变，民主热忱，体现在对全村工作与他的家庭生产领导中。农会主席路文全和王周则，也改变了过去的不民主作风，处处受到群众欢迎，成了新的劳动英雄与模范。在他们领导下，党员深入互助组带头生产，真正体现了全体党员团结群众生产、发家致富的目的。第二、组织起来发家致富。全村在过去组织起来的基础与经验上，真正贯彻了群众要求与自愿相结合的原则，全村所有的户数都组织起来，在工变工、等价交换、分工灵活（大活集中、小活分散）、折工公道、按时清理帐目的原则下，男女全部上地劳动，团结与热情生产的气氛洋溢全村。第三、全年贯彻了技术指导。下种时，普遍推广了大垄谷，普遍进行了三锄，玉茭上了追肥（每亩上到一百多石），雹灾后又组织了扶苗剪叶，减少了二成损失。第四、每个季节订出了短期计划，按季完成，及时检查总结，评选英雄模范，予以表扬奖励。抓紧了群众的热劲，一个运动接着一个运动的推进生产工作。第五、长期计划与短期计划结合的紧，没有长期计划，生产是盲目的，没有短期计划与经常检查，长期计划就会落空。全村有十四户订有五年发家计划，在每个农业生产的空隙要进行其他生产与准备。比如在秋收秋耕中，就计划收耕完起石头砸土坯准备修盖。
    现在已订出了冬季生产计划，准备烧燃和搞副业，给明年开春盖房修作好准备。
    英雄李顺达同志本人，在一九四六年春，经过家庭会议所订定的五年生产发家建设计划，经全家二年半的努力，现已基本实现，订有五年生产发家计划的其余十三家，在顺达的积极影响下，正努力赶上。（长群、效诚、满会）
