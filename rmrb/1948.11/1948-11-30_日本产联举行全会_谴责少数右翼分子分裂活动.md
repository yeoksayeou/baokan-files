Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. Tokyo dispatch: The Industrial Labor Union Federation of Japan, the largest labor organization in Japan, held its fourth national congress in Tokyo on the 19th. On the second day of the congress, a resolution condemning the divisive activities of a few right-wing elements was passed by an absolute majority. The resolution denounced the right-wing splittists in the trade union as "agents of the capitalists" and "harming the interests of the workers," and expelled three top leaders of the Democratization League, the representatives of a few right-wing elements, from membership. After the aforementioned few right-wing elements announced their withdrawal from the Industrial Federation on the first day of the congress, they threatened to form another Industrial Labor Union Federation. The congress finally passed a message of salute to the French coal miners' union, protesting the French government's brutal suppression of the strike.

　　日本产联举行全会
  　谴责少数右翼分子分裂活动
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】东京讯：日本最大的劳工组织——产业劳动组合联合会，于十九日在东京举行第四次全国代表大会。大会第二日以绝对多数通过谴责少数右翼分子分裂活动的决议。决议斥责工会中右翼分裂分子为“资本家的代理人”，“损害工人的利益”，并将少数右翼分子的代表——民主化同盟的最高领袖三人开除会籍。上述少数右翼分子在大会第一日宣布退出产联后，扬言将另组一个产业劳动组合联合会。大会最后通过向法国煤矿工人工会的致敬电，其中对法国政府的野蛮镇压罢工表示抗议。
