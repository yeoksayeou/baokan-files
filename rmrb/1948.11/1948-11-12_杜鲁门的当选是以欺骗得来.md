　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Progressive world opinion points out that Truman's defeat of Dewey is a victory of one reactionary over another. Electric News Agency quoted Warsaw newspaper comments as saying: No one believes that Truman, whose name is associated with terror and interventionism in Greece and China, will now change. Progressive newspapers all emphasized that Truman's election was largely due to his trickery in deceiving voters. The French Communist newspaper L'Humanité pointed out: Truman's attempt to negotiate directly with the Soviet Union in violation of Marshall's opinion was undoubtedly intended to give voters a good impression. The Polish Workers' Newspaper pointed out that Truman was elected "because in recent months he stole various radical slogans from Roosevelt's 'New Deal' arsenal," and many voters naively believed that "voting for Truman was voting for progress and peace."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Electric News Agency, New York: Wallace broadcast on the 3rd that the Progressive Party's task now is to develop its organization. The Progressive Party has completed a huge task in obtaining the qualifications to participate in elections in forty-five states in the short term. He said that Trumanism and the Marshall Plan would lead to the collapse of the United States. According to TASS on the 4th, Wallace, in a telegram to Truman, urged Truman to fulfill his promises regarding controlling prices, abolishing the Taft-Hartley Act, guaranteeing the civil rights of black people, and fully recognizing the State of Israel. The telegram also stated: As long as the "Cold War" policy continues, as long as more and more money is used to support foreign reactionary regimes, arm Western Europe, and militarize the United States, these goals cannot be achieved and economic bankruptcy is inevitable. The telegram called on Truman to abandon the so-called bipartisan foreign policy, dismiss military personnel and bankers from public office, and restore Roosevelt's policies.

　　杜鲁门的当选是以欺骗得来
    【新华社陕北八日电】世界进步舆论指出，杜鲁门之击败杜威，乃是一个反动派对另外一个反动派的胜利。电通社引华沙各报评论指出：没有人相信，以其名字冠在恐怖及在希腊和中国实行干涉主义之前的杜鲁门，现在会有什么改变。进步报纸均强调杜鲁门之获选与他欺骗选民的诡计有很大关系。法共人道报指出：杜鲁门之试图违反马歇尔意见而直接与苏联进行谈判，无疑是想给选民一个好印象。波兰工人报指出，杜鲁门之所以获选，是“因为他最近几月来从罗斯福‘新政’言论武库中窃取了各种急进的口号”，而不少选民则轻信“投杜鲁门的票就是投了进步与和平的票”。
    【新华社陕北八日电】电通社纽约讯：华莱士于三日广播称：进步党今后的任务是发展组织。进步党短期内在四十五州取得了参加竞选的资格，这就完成巨大的任务。他说；杜鲁门主义和马歇尔计划会使美国崩溃。又据塔斯社四日电，华莱士在致杜鲁门的电文中，敦促杜鲁门履行其关于管制物价，废除塔夫脱——哈特莱法案，保证黑人公民权利及完全承认以色列国的诺言。该电又称：只要“冷战”政策继续不已，只要愈益增多的金钱被用于支持外国反动政权，武装西欧和使美国军国主义化，则这些目的就不能实现，经济破产就不可避免。电文要求杜鲁门放弃所谓两党外交政策，罢免军人及银行家的公职，并恢复罗斯福的政策。
