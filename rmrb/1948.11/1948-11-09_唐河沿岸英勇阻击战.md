　　Heroic Blocking Action Along the Tang River
    Li Fu
    In the blocking action along the Tang River, the people's loyal guards wrote the most glorious page. The 94th Army, equipped with American weapons and carrying a menacing ferocity, bombarded our positions with more than three hundred and forty shells per hour, but they were stopped, and the glorious front line of the Tang River stood firm.
    On the morning of September 30th, the enemy set out from Wangdu and attacked us fiercely from three directions—east, north, and west—at 11:00 AM, attempting to occupy Ding County. However, their attempt was foiled by the heroic resistance of our warriors. The enemy's 101st Army, 272nd Division (formerly the Provisional 32nd Division of the New 2nd Army) on the eastern route, after being partially annihilated by our troops near Dongshiyi, retreated despondently to the north bank of the Tang River at 5:00 PM. The 5th and 121st Divisions of the 94th Army on the northern and western routes launched a deep offensive against our positions, with the battle centered on Tangcheng. Tangcheng is located on the south bank of the Tang River, where the river is only a foot and a half deep, and the bandit army attacked from the east, west, and north.
    When the Liberation Army soldiers entered the bunker, the regimental political commissar mobilized everyone, saying: "Comrades: Resolutely block the enemy from advancing south and defend Shijiazhuang. This is the glorious task assigned to us by the higher party organization! Gunners, machine gunners, sharpshooters, and all commanders and fighters, bravely accept this task. Make contributions for the people! We will win the glorious title of 'Iron Fighting Regiment'!" Following this call, the Seventh Company in the bunker shouted: "We swear to defend this place to the death!" The Second Company's soldiers proposed: "Rather advance an inch than retreat a step! Resolutely complete the task assigned by the higher authorities!" These heroic vows were gloriously realized in the battle. From 11:00 AM to 5:00 PM, the enemy launched fourteen attacks on our positions, but all were repulsed. Initially, the enemy attacked Tangcheng with a company, but they were beaten back.
    In the second attack, the enemy charged with two companies. When more than forty enemies had just crossed the river, under the blocking fire of our light and heavy machine guns, none of them made it back. Subsequently, the enemy continued to organize charges, attempting to retrieve the wounded under heavy fire cover and using dense formations to rush us, trying to seize the Tangcheng River Bridge. The walls at the front were knocked down by the enemy, the communication trenches were flattened, and the dust was so thick that people could not be seen, but the instructor proposed: "Resolutely block the enemy and strive to make contributions!" At this moment, Ma Junyi calmly and tenaciously shot down twelve enemies in a row. Fifth Squad Leader Liu Zhulin ran out of ammunition, fixed his bayonet, and prepared to engage the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. He said to the soldiers: "Stay calm, the Fifth Division is nothing special. We'll fight them with bayonets when they get close!" Small artilleryman Dong Jiaxiang hit the enemy with three consecutive shots. In this fierce battle, comrades Yin Zhixiang and Wan Xiyou sacrificed their lives. The deputy squad leader resolved: "As long as we are alive, we cannot lose the position. We must prepare our grenades and throw them at the enemy when they come up. We will avenge our dead comrades!" Sure enough, the reactionaries' repeated attacks were repelled, and more than two hundred dead and wounded were left groaning on the riverbank.
    The enemy attacking Xinlizhuang was again beaten back by the Seventh Company, which held its position, inflicting over sixty casualties on the enemy and capturing a machine gun. With the expansion of the victory, the Party Committee proposed in the trenches: "Make meritorious service at the front line" and "Model Fighting Company." News from various units was broadcast at any time, and the morale of the soldiers was very high. At nightfall, the regiment commander issued the order: "Take advantage of the opportunity to launch a counter-offensive against the enemy and resolutely drive them away." The soldiers waded through the water in the cold night, counterattacking the enemy six times, driving them back and retaking the position.
    The battle ended at 11:00 PM. After a day of fierce fighting, our Tang River position finally stood firm.

　　唐河沿岸英勇阻击战
    力夫
    唐河沿岸的阻击战中，人民忠实的警卫员们写下了最光荣的一页。那些带着逼人的凶焰而来的美械装备的九十四军，以每点钟三百四十余发炮弹向我阵地猛攻，但他们被阻止住，光荣的唐河第一线顽强不屈。
    九月卅日早晨，敌人从望都出发，于上午十一点分东、北、西三路向我猛犯，企图占占领定县。但在我勇士们英勇的抗击下，敌人的企图被粉碎了。东路敌一零一军二七二师（即前新二军暂三十二师），于东市邑被我某部歼灭一部后，于下午五点颓丧的缩到唐河北岸。北路、西路以九十四军的五师、一二一师向我阵地纵深进犯，战斗的发展以唐城为中心。唐城位唐河南岸，河水尺半余深，匪军从东、西、北三面迂回进攻。
    当解放军的战士们走进地堡时，团政治委员对大家动员说：“同志们：坚决阻击敌人南进，保卫石家庄，这是上级党给我们的光荣任务！炮手、机枪射手、特等射手及全体指战员们，要勇敢的接受这一任务。为人民立功，我们要赢得‘钢铁战斗团’的光荣称号！”随着这种声音，七连地堡里发出：“我们誓死坚守这里！”二连战士们提出：“宁前进一寸，不得后退一步！坚决完成上级给予的任务！”英勇的誓言都在战斗中光荣的实现了。从十一点到下午五点，敌人向我阵地连突十四次，都被打回去了。开头敌人以一个连的兵力向我唐城突击，被打回去。
    二次敌人以两个连的兵力向我冲锋，当四十多个敌人刚过了河，在我轻重机枪炮火的阻击下，敌人一个也没有回去。随后敌人又陆续的组织冲锋，抢伤号，以重火力掩护，用密集的队形向我突击，企图抢占唐城河桥。前沿的墙被敌人打倒了，交通沟打平了，尘烟弥漫的看不见人，但指导员提出：“坚决阻击敌人，争取立功！”正在这时候，马俊义沉着顽强连打倒敌人十二个。五班长刘竹林子弹没了，按上刺刀准备和敌人刺杀。他对战士们说：“沉住气，第五师也没有了不起的，近了就拼刺刀！”小炮手董稼祥，连发三炮都打中敌人。在这次激战中，尹志祥、玩希有三个同志牺牲了，副班长下了决心说：“只要我们活着，就不能将阵地丢了，我们要把手榴弹准备好，敌人上来了就打，要为死去的同志们报仇！”果然，反动派的数次进攻都被打退了，二百多死伤者被丢在河沿上，哀号呻吟。
    进攻辛立庄的敌人，又遭我坚守阵地的七连打得人号马叫，杀伤敌六十余名，缴获机枪一挺。随着胜利的开展，党委会在战壕中又提出：“火线立功”，“模范战斗连”。各单位的消息随时进行了广播，战士们情绪非常高涨。战斗到天黑，团长发出命令：“趁机向敌人反冲锋，坚决驱逐敌人。”战士们在寒夜里，涉水向敌人反击六次，将敌人打退，重新夺回阵地。
    战斗至夜十一点结束，激战一天，我唐河阵地终于屹立不动。
