Since the Kuomintang reactionary government announced the "currency reform" on August 19th, for the past two months, it has dispatched large numbers of police, gendarmes, and special agent henchmen to various towns to arrest, punish, imprison, and even execute the broad masses of people, using such brutal means to "crack down on black markets" and "limit prices." However, the actual development has been contrary to the reactionaries' wishes. In the past two months, prices in the Chiang-controlled areas have been rising continuously like a "runaway horse," and the value of the bogus Gold Yuan notes is repeating the path of the "Legal Tender," plummeting rapidly. This can be objectively confirmed by the following price changes in some major cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. For example, the price changes of bogus Gold Yuan notes in Tianjin from August 19th to October 13th are as follows:

	Item	Unit	Price Limit on August 19th	Price on October 13th	Percentage Increase
	Battleship Flour	Bag	11.00 yuan		80.00 yuan		727
	Rice	Jin	0.22 yuan		2.00 yuan		909
	Wheat	Jin	0.17 yuan		1.50 yuan		882
	Millet	Jin	0.15 yuan		1.60 yuan		1,067
	Corn	Jin	0.10 yuan		1.20 yuan		1,200
	Cotton	Jin	1.60 yuan		5.00 yuan		313
	Five-blessing Cloth	Bolt	38.50 yuan		140.00 yuan		364

From the above changes in the prices of seven items in Tianjin in just fifty-four days, it can be seen that the prices of grains have increased by at least six times and as much as eleven times, and even cotton, which has the smallest price increase, has risen by more than two times. This wave of price increases is still in full swing.

In Qingdao, in the five days from October 10th to 14th, various prices all increased by two to five times. For example, on October 10th, millet was 0.35 yuan per jin (bogus Gold Yuan notes, same below), Double Child cloth was 28 yuan per bolt, and Battleship Flour was 8 yuan per bag. By the 14th, they had risen to 1 yuan per jin for millet, 63 yuan per bolt for Double Child cloth, and 50 yuan per bag for Battleship Flour. Gold was 440 yuan per tael on October 10th, 580 yuan on October 13th, 800 yuan on October 14th, and as high as 1,000 yuan per tael on October 15th, an increase of more than double in six days. In Shanghai, although the pressure applied by the Chiang bandits on "price limits" is greater than in other cities, according to a report by the Associated Press on the 15th: all items "semi-official prices (referring to officially tolerated black market prices) are 100 to 200 percent higher than official prices." In Xi'an, a comparison of prices between October 10th and 15th: foreign cloth rose from 160 million yuan (bogus Legal Tender, same below) per bolt to 500 million yuan per bolt, local cloth rose from 860,000 yuan per foot to 3 million yuan per foot, and gold rose from 1.2 billion yuan to 3.2 billion yuan. In addition, in cities such as Guangzhou, Kunming, and Chongqing, various prices have also been soaring in the past two months.

During the same period, the exchange rate between the bogus Gold Yuan and the US dollar has depreciated from the originally stipulated four to one to ten to thirteen yuan to one. And the exchange rate between Chiang's currency and our liberated area currency has also been rapidly depreciating during this period. For example, in late August, one yuan of Beihai currency in our Shandong area could be exchanged for 1,000 yuan of Legal Tender, and 3,000 yuan of Beihai currency could be exchanged for one yuan of bogus Gold Yuan. By early October, one yuan of Beihai currency could be exchanged for 3,000 yuan of Legal Tender, and 1,000 yuan of Beihai currency could be exchanged for one yuan of bogus Gold Yuan. In mid-October, one yuan of Beihai currency could be exchanged for 6,000 to 8,000 yuan of "Legal Tender," and 700 yuan of Beihai currency could be exchanged for one yuan of bogus Gold Yuan.

Following the rapid depreciation of Chiang's currency and soaring prices, a buying panic has swept across the Kuomintang-controlled areas. After all kinds of daily necessities were snapped up, the buying targets have expanded to books, stationery, and even coffins. According to an Associated Press report from Shanghai on the 20th: recently, "the coffin business is very prosperous. Since most stores have been sold out after the buying spree, Shanghai residents have turned to coffins, and they are also looking for goods that can buy good wood." In Guangzhou, top-quality rice cannot be bought at any price recently, peanut oil cannot be bought, and only a small amount of second-class rice can be bought. As for those who ransack and beat up stores in order to grab goods, it happens everywhere.

On the other hand, what about the various prices in our three major liberated areas of North China, East China, and Northwest China from late August to mid-October? This can be seen from the following price changes in several major towns.

	Item	Unit	Price in late August	Price in mid-October	Percentage Increase/Decrease
	I. Shijiazhuang City (Ji Currency)
	Millet	Jin	350 yuan		335 yuan		(Decrease) 4
	Corn	Jin	275 yuan		225 yuan		(Decrease) 18
	Wheat	Jin	375 yuan		375 yuan		Flat
	Cotton	Jin	2,000 yuan		2,500 yuan		(Increase) 25
	Local Cloth	Square Foot	300 yuan		325 yuan		(Increase) 8
	Salt	Jin	320 yuan		340 yuan		(Increase) 6
	Peanut Oil	Jin	1,830 yuan		2,450 yuan		(Increase) 21
	II. Huimin City (Beihai Currency)
	Millet	Jin	160 yuan		180 yuan		(Increase) 13
	Wheat	Jin	360 yuan		430 yuan		(Increase) 19
	Cotton	Jin	2,800 yuan		3,000 yuan		(Increase) 7
	Local Cloth	Market Foot	470 yuan		500 yuan		(Increase) 6
	Peanut Oil	Jin	2,800 yuan		2,800 yuan		Flat
	Salt	Jin	200 yuan		200 yuan		Flat
	III. Yan'an City (Northwest Agricultural Currency)
	Millet	Jin	5,200 yuan		6,420 yuan		(Increase) 23
	Corn	Jin	2,839 yuan		3,580 yuan		(Increase) 26
	Wheat	Jin	3,549 yuan		6,420 yuan		(Increase) 81
	Cotton	Jin	58,639 yuan		49,200 yuan		(Decrease) 16
	Salt	Jin	7,539 yuan		7,122 yuan		(Decrease) 6
	Peanut Oil	Jin	39,372 yuan		29,320 yuan		(Decrease) 26

From the above changes in prices in the three places, we can see that prices in the liberated areas were quite stable during this period. Among them, the prices in Shijiazhuang City were the most stable. Even taking cotton, which had the largest price increase, as an example, the increase was only 25 percent. As for corn, peanut oil, etc., the price actually decreased by about 20 percent. Although Yan'an was recently recovered from the Hu bandits and its economy suffered tremendous damage, various prices were also in a stable state. Furthermore, in Jinan City, which was recently liberated, due to the timely and large-scale supply of cheap daily necessities by the democratic government and the rapid expulsion of Chiang's currency (which has now been discontinued and no longer exchanged), the Beihai currency prices of various items have generally fallen by 35 to 64 percent in the past half month. For example:

	Item	Unit	Price on October 4th	Price on October 18th	Percentage Decrease
	Flour	Jin	1,400 yuan		910 yuan		35
	High-quality Rice	Jin	1,400 yuan		900 yuan		36
	Millet	Jin	700 yuan		400 yuan		43
	Corn	Jin	550 yuan		250 yuan		55
	Soybeans	Jin	750 yuan		320 yuan		57
	Salt	Jin	550 yuan		300 yuan		45
	Pork	Jin	4,000 yuan		2,300 yuan		43
	Dawn Matches	Pack	2,800 yuan		1,000 yuan		64
	Raw Oil	Jin	4,000 yuan		1,900 yuan		53

From the above comparison of prices in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and our liberated areas during the same period, the basic conclusions that can be drawn are as follows:

First, the "currency reform" of the Kuomintang reactionary government has completely failed in less than two months. The above facts powerfully prove the correctness of the assessment made by the Xinhua News Agency reporter on August 28th: "This is a great inflation, a great deception, and a great plunder." "The result of the 'currency reform' will inevitably cause greater chaos in the areas ruled by the Chiang bandits and promote the final collapse of the Chiang bandits." Second, our people in the liberated areas, witnessing the various sufferings of the people under the rule of the Chiang bandits due to malignant inflation, must cherish the currency issued by the democratic government even more, and especially be more vigilant and quickly expel enemy currency from the liberated areas. Only in this way can we protect our wealth and avoid being plundered by enemy currency.

    两种物价
    自八月十九日国民党反动政府宣布“币制改革”以后，两个月来，派遣了大批的警察、宪兵、特务爪牙等在各城镇对广大人民施行逮捕、惩罚、监禁，以至枪决等残暴手段，借以“取缔黑市”“限制物价”。但事实的发展，却与反动派的愿望相反。近两月来蒋区物价，正如“脱缰之马”连续暴涨，伪金圆券之币值，正重蹈着“法币”的复辙，日益在猛跌，这从以下国民党区几个大城市部分的物价变化中可以得到客观的证实。如天津八月十九日至十月十三日伪金圆券的物价变化如下：物    品  单位  八月十九日限价  十月十三日价格    上涨百分比兵船面粉  袋    一一·○○元      八○·○○元        七二七大    米  市斤      ·二二元        二·○○元        九○九小    麦  市斤      ·一七元        一·五○元        八八二小    米  市斤      ·一五元        一·六○元    一、○六七玉    米  市斤      ·一○元        一·二○元    一、二○○棉    花  市斤    一·六○元        五·○○元        三一三五福洋布  匹    三八·五○元    一四○·○○元        三六四
    从以上天津短短的五十四天七种物价变化中，可以看出，粮食类上涨少者六倍多，高者达十一倍，涨价最少的棉花，亦上涨两倍多。这一涨风，正方兴未艾。
    在青岛十月十日至十四日的五天中，各种物价皆上涨两倍到五倍。如十月十日小米每斤三角五分（伪金圆券下同），双童布每匹二十八元，兵船面粉每袋八元，至十四日即涨至小米每斤一元，双童布每匹六十三元，兵船面粉每袋五十元。黄金十月十日每两四百四十元，十三日五百八十元，十四日八百元，十五日高达一千元一两，六天之内上涨一倍以上。上海方面，蒋匪所施于“限价”上的压力，虽较其它城市为大，但据合众社十五日透露：一切物品“半官方价格（按指官方默许的黑市价），高出官价百分之百到二百。”西安方面，十月十日与十五日两日物价比较：洋布由一亿六千万元（伪法币下同）一匹，涨至五亿元一匹，土布由八十六万元一尺，涨至三百万元一尺，黄金由十二亿元涨至三十二亿元。此外如广州、昆明、重庆等城市，近两月来的各种物价，亦在狂奔上涨。
    同时期伪金圆券与美元的比价，已由原来规定的四比一，贬值至十至十三元比一。而蒋币与我解放区货币的比价，这一时期内，亦在迅速的贬值中。如八月下旬我山东区的北海币一元兑法币一千元，北海币三千元兑伪金圆券一元。至十月上旬则北海币一元兑法币三千元。北海币一千元兑伪金圆券一元。十月中旬北海币一元兑“法币”六千元至八千元，北海币七百元兑伪金圆券一元。
    随着蒋币的迅速贬值与物价暴涨，接踵而来的就是抢购风潮，遍及国民党区各地。在各种日用品抢购一空后，抢购对象已扩大到书籍文具以至棺材。据美联社上海二十日电报导：近来“棺材生意很兴隆。由于抢购之后大多数商店均已告罄，上海民众已转向棺材，他们并正在需求能买到上好木材的货色。”在广州近来上等大米以任何价格都买不到，花生油已买不到，二等米仅能买到少量，至于为了抢购物品，而将商店抢光与殴打者，则更是到处发生。
    反观我华北、华东、西北三大解放区自八月下旬至十月中旬的各种物价又是怎样呢？这从以下几个主要城镇的物价变化中，即可看出一般。物  品  单位    八月下旬价格    十月中旬价格  涨落百分比一、石家庄市（冀钞）小  米    斤        三五○元        三三五元  （落）    四玉  米    斤        二七五元        二二五元  （落）  一八小  麦    斤        三七五元        三七五元        平棉  花    斤    二、○○○元    二、五○○元  （涨）  二五土  布  方尺        三○○元        三二五元  （涨）    八盐        斤        三二○元        三四○元  （涨）    六花生油    斤    一、八三○元    二、四五○元  （涨）  二一二、惠民城（北海币）小  米    斤        一六○元        一八○元  （涨）  十三小  麦    斤        三六○元        四三○元  （涨）  十九棉  花    斤    二、八○○元    三、○○○元  （涨）    七土  布  市尺        四七○元        五○○元  （落）    六花生油    斤    二、八○○元    二、八○○元        平食  盐    斤        二○○元        二○○元        平三、延安市（西北农币）小  米    斤    五、二○○元    六、四二○元  （涨）  二三玉  米    斤    二、八三九元    三、五八○元  （涨）  二六小  麦    斤    三、五四九元    六、四二○元  （涨）  八一棉  花    斤  五八、六三九元  四九、二○○元  （落）  一六食  盐    斤    七、五三九元    七、一二二元  （落）    六花生油    斤  三九、三七二元  二九、三二○元  （落）  二六
    从上述三地的各种物价变化中，我们可以看出解放区的物价，这一时期内是相当平稳的。其中尤以石家庄市的物价为最稳定，即以涨价最多的棉花为例，上涨亦不过百分之二十五，至于玉米、花生油等，相反地落价百分之二十左右。延安虽从胡匪手中收复不久，经济遭受巨大摧残，但各种物价同样是处于平稳的状态。再如刚解放不久的济南市的物价，由于民主政府及时大量的供应平价日用必需品以及迅速驱除蒋币（现已停用停兑），近半月来各种物品的北海币价格，亦普遍降落百分之三十五到百分之六十四。如：物    品  单位    十月四日价格    十月十八日价格  降落百分比面    粉    斤    一、四○○元          九一○元        三五上等大米    斤    一、四○○元          九○○元        三六小    米    斤        七○○元          四○○元        四三玉    米    斤        五五○元          二五○元        五五黄    豆    斤        七五○元          三二○元        五七食    盐    斤        五五○元          三○○元        四五猪    肉    斤    四、○○○元      二、三○○元        四三黎明火柴    封    二、八○○元      一、○○○元        六四生    油    斤    四、○○○元      一、九○○元        五三
    从上述国民党区与我解放区同一时期的物价对比中，所能答出的基本结论就是如下两点：
    第一、国民党反动政府的“货币改革”为时不到两个月，就已全部破产。上述事实有力的证明了八月二十八日新华社记者评中所指出的：“这是一次大膨胀，大骗局和大掠夺。”“‘币制改革’的结果，必然引起蒋匪统治区的更大混乱，促进蒋匪的最后崩溃。”为一论断的正确。第二、我们解放区人民目击蒋匪统治下人民在恶性通货膨胀下所受种种痛苦，必须更加爱护民主政府发行的货币，尤其是要更加警惕，迅速驱逐敌币出解放区，只有这样才能保护自己的财富，免受敌币的掠夺。
