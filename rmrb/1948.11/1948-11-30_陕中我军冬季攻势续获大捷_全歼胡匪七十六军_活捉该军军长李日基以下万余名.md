Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Front, November 28th: The Northwest People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the enemy 76th Army, which was entrenched in Yongfeng Town, Chengcheng County, on the east bank of the Luo River, at 9:00 AM today. Over 10,000 enemy troops, including the army commander Li Riji, were captured alive. Detailed battle results are still being verified.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, November 27th: On November 11th, in the battle to annihilate the enemy Huang Botao Corps' 63rd Army in Yaowan, east of the Grand Canal, a certain battalion of the People's Liberation Army won over an enemy battalion to lay down their arms by speaking to them. That afternoon, before the attack had even started, the 3rd Battalion decided to first speak to the enemy across the river. Liu Zongkun, the cultural instructor of the 8th Company, wrote eight large characters on a large piece of paper: "Surrounded on all sides, surrender and you will not be killed," and hung it high on the position. The battalion political instructor personally led the soldiers in shouting across the river, publicizing our army's series of victories since the liberation of Jinan, and our army's policy towards prisoners, telling the enemy that they were surrounded and that laying down their arms was the only way to survive. Soon, three or four figures walked towards the riverbank. But at this time, the enemy's pillbox opened fire, and the figures lay down motionless. The political instructor then ordered the artillery to fire two shots at the enemy's pillbox, blocking the enemy's fire. Then everyone continued to shout, and many liberated soldiers were called upon to introduce their situation after being liberated. The figures lying on the riverbank got up. They hesitated on the riverbank for a while, then floated across the river, which was so deep it went over their heads. Our army immediately took them ashore, and the soldiers exchanged their cotton clothes for them. The four people who came over were all from Guangdong. One of them said he was a deputy platoon leader, and said, "Please don't shoot, everyone over there wants to come over." They shouted to the opposite bank in Cantonese. In this way, an entire battalion of enemies ran to the river bank in groups. The political instructor of our battalion ordered them to be crossed over in a small boat, and sent people to help them. Nine boats were crossed, one boat after another. But because the boat was small and there were many people, the order was finally given to build a bridge. Those who laid down their weapons, guns, mules and horses were then able to cross the river completely on the bridge.

　　陕中我军冬季攻势续获大捷
  　全歼胡匪七十六军
    活捉该军军长李日基以下万余名
    【新华社陕中前线二十八日电】西北人民解放军于今日上午九时，全歼踞守洛河东岸澄城县属永丰镇之敌七十六军，生俘该军军长李日基以下万余名，详细战果正清查中。
    【新华社淮海前线二十七日电】十一月十一日，在运河东岸窑湾歼敌黄伯韬兵团六十三军之役，解放军某部三营以喊话方式争取了该敌一个营放下武器。是日下午，攻击尚未开始，三营决定先对隔河之敌进行喊话。八连文化教员刘宗坤，用大幅宽纸写“四面紧围，缴枪不杀”八个大字，高悬在阵地上。营教导员即亲自领导战士隔河喊话，宣传我军自解放济南以来的一连串胜利，和我军的俘虏政策，即告诉敌人已陷入重围，只有放下武器才是生路。不久，对岸就有三、四个人影向河边走来。但这时敌碉堡上却打起枪来，人影就伏下不动了。教导员于是下命令炮兵向敌碉堡打了两炮，把敌人的射击封锁了。接着大家又进行喊话，并叫被解放的战士多人介绍被解放后的情形。伏在河边的人影就爬起来。他们在河边上犹豫了一会，便浮过水深没顶的河流。我军当即将他们接上岸，战士们并将自己的棉衣给他们换上。过来的四个人都是广东人，其中一个说他是副排长，他说：“请你们不要打枪，那边都要过来的。”他们就用广东话向对岸喊叫起来。这样，一个整营的敌人便陆续成群地向河岸跑来。我营教导员命令把他们用一只小船划过来，并派人帮助他们，一船一船地过来了九船。但因船小人多，最后乃命令架桥。放下武器的人枪骡马，才由桥上全部过河来。
