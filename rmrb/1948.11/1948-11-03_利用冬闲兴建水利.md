    Utilizing Winter Slack Season to Build Water Conservancy Projects
    Sun Mai
    Now, more than ever before, we have favorable conditions for widely carrying out large and small-scale water conservancy construction. Due to the victory of the People's Liberation War, many rivers have also been liberated. After the land reform, farmers are actively hoping to take their production a step further. Geographically, North China has a network of large and small rivers, and there are vast shallow groundwater areas that can be utilized. As long as the leadership grasps this opportunity, there will be great achievements in water conservancy construction this winter and next spring. Now that the autumn harvest is about to pass, widely carrying out large and small-scale water conservancy construction, and seizing the time to repair and make plans for large and small water conservancy projects, is a powerful guarantee for increasing agricultural production in North China by even a small amount.

    To effectively carry out this work, what should we do this winter and next spring?

    First, we must systematically investigate and understand the water conservancy situation in various regions, and make specific plans based on the demands of the masses. Water conservancy construction includes many aspects, such as drilling springs and wells, blocking gullies and opening canals, depositing silt to form land, digging ditches for drainage, and flood prevention and river management. In terms of projects, there are new constructions, restoration of old projects, or expansion of existing projects. For many years, due to the enemy's long-term division and disruption, we have been unable to comprehensively understand the water conservancy situation in various regions. Now that the conditions for implementing unified planning are fully available, it is very necessary to systematically investigate and understand the water conservancy situation in various regions. The content of the investigation and understanding should pay attention to the nature of the river, the size of the water flow, the organization and management of canals, the lack of waterwheels and wells, geographical conditions, crop types, and the demands of the masses.

    Second, we must carry out effective encouragement and organization work, and solve all practical difficulties. Water conservancy is a mass undertaking, and the problems are complex. Issues such as the burden of labor costs, manpower mobilization, canal land occupation, water distribution, organization and management, and all historical disputes must be properly resolved, otherwise, it will affect the progress of the project. We must break down the ideological concerns of the masses, such as superstition about feng shui, localism, and fear of increasing the burden (we should publicize and reward policies for water conservancy construction). In water conservancy construction, we must adhere to the principle that the downstream obeys the upstream, the upstream takes care of the downstream, the small benefit obeys the large benefit, and the partial obeys the overall.

    Third, we must accept past experiences and lessons: The key to the success or failure of water conservancy construction lies first in the careful consideration of the plan and the accuracy of the construction. Such as the collection of hydrological data, the calculation of flow and velocity, the determination of slope, the selection of canal mouths, and the design of cross-sections. Furthermore, it is necessary to adhere to the engineering requirements during construction, oppose any sloppy, careless, and shoddy work, irresponsible attitudes, or emphasizing personal experience and enthusiasm, and rushing for quick results without following engineering principles. During construction, we must also give appropriate estimates based on existing material conditions and the technical level of the staff. Overly high or low estimates will result in unnecessary losses. Water conservancy construction is a scientific work, and we must proceed from reality, with a serious scientific attitude, be conscientious and responsible, and also make the project plan understood and mastered by the masses, so as to improve work efficiency and enthusiasm and avoid all unnecessary losses.

    Fourth, based on the current understanding of the situation, the following work suggestions are put forward:

    In the upper reaches of various rivers (the part that has not yet emerged from the mountain pass), where there are many tributaries, we should carry out a large number of water conservancy and irrigation projects according to the terrain and water potential, turning dry land into paddy fields. Utilizing mountain floods to deposit silt and improve soil quality will not only increase yields (one mu after silt deposition can be equivalent to two or three mu of yield), but also regulate floods and reduce sediment discharge, which is conducive to river management work downstream, achieving multiple benefits in one fell swoop. This can be greatly developed in areas such as Yannan in Chahar, the Sanggan River, and the upper reaches of the Tuo River, where the masses are also accustomed to it. The second is the work of forming and protecting beaches: This year's rainfall is large and concentrated, some beaches have been washed away, and some beach protection projects must be strengthened. We should use the winter slack season to quarry stones and prepare materials in order to form embankments.

    After the river just comes out of the mountain pass, the river has no mountain constraints, the terrain is wide, and the slope suddenly slows down, the river channel rushes left and right, causing great harm. The Tang River, Sha River, and Tuo River all have this hazard, and attention should be paid to prevention and control, restricting the river channel and bringing it into the right track so that it does not cause harm.

    Most of the rivers in North China flow through the Hebei Plain (such as the South and North Grand Canal, Yongding River, Daqing River, Ziya River, etc.) and converge near Tianjin into the Hai River and enter the sea. Due to years of silt accumulation, the riverbed is high and padded, and the river flows above ground. In addition, due to the long-term disrepair of the dikes, many dikes are low and thin, which further increases the risk of breaching during floods, causing great harm. Consolidating dikes is still an effective emergency measure at present (fundamentally, dikes are not a good strategy). In order to protect the lives and property of the people, we should organize forces to consolidate dangerous works, strengthen dikes, and build sections where dangers may occur.

    Digging ditches for drainage and improving cultivated land: In many places, disasters are caused by the accumulation of rainwater due to the low-lying terrain; or because the terrain is shady and low-lying, which is unfavorable to crop growth, on-site reconnaissance and measurement should be carried out to find a way out, so that the water has a place to go and reduce the harm. However, attention should be paid to the phenomenon of benefiting one at the expense of the other.

    On both sides of the Pinghan Railway, groundwater is discharged. We should vigorously organize the masses to widely carry out well drilling and waterwheel purchase campaigns.

    利用冬闲兴建水利
    孙迈
    广泛开展大小水利建设，现在比过去任何时候都具备着有利条件；由于人民解放战争的胜利，许多河道也跟着解放；土改后农民积极希望着把生产提高一步；地理条件上，华北大小河流纵横，且有广大的地下浅水层地带，可供利用。只要领导上抓紧，今冬明春的水利建设，定会有大的成绩。现秋收将过，广泛开展大小水利建设，抓紧兴修与作好大小水利计划，是把华北农业生产提高一寸的有力保证。
    为了有效的开展这一工作，今冬明春我们应作些什么呢？
    第一、是有计划有步骤的调查了解各个地区的水利情况，根据群众要求，作出具体计划。水利建设的内容是多方面的：如凿泉凿井，挡汪开渠，放淤成滩，挑沟排水，防洪治河等；在工程方面：有建设新的，恢复旧的，或在原有工程上给以扩大等。多年来，由于敌人长期的分划与扰乱，我们不能把各个地区的水利情况，进行全面的了解。现在实行统一计划，条件已完全具备，有计划的调查了解各个地区的水利情况，是非常必要的。调查了解的内容，应注意河道性质，水量大小，渠道组织管理，水车水井缺乏情形，地理条件，作物种类，群众要求等。
    第二、进行有效的鼓励与组织工作，解决一切实际困难问题。水利事业，是一种群众性的建设，问题是复杂的：如工费负担，人力动员，渠道占地，使水分配，组织管理，及一切历史纠纷等，都须给以很好的解决，否则便影响了工程的进行。要打破群众的思想顾虑，如迷信风水，本位主义，怕增加负担等（应宣传奖励兴修水利政策）。在水利建设中，应掌握住下游服从上游，上游照顾下游，小利服从大利，局部服从整体。
    第三、必须接受过去的经验教训：水利建设成功与失败的关键，首先在于计划的慎重考虑与建设的精确。如水文资料的搜集，流量流速的计算，坡度的确定，渠口的选择，断面的设计等。再便是施工中坚持工程要求，反对任何马虎潦草，偷工减料，不认真负责的态度，或不根据工程原理，强调个人经验热情，急于求成。施工时还须根据现存的物质条件与员工技术水平，给以适当估计，过高或过低的估计都会遭到不必要的损失，水利建设，是一种科学工作，必须从实际出发，以严肃科学的态度，认真负责，还要使工程计划为群众了解掌握，才能提高工作效率与热情，避免一切不必要的损失。
    第四、根据目前了解情况，提出以下工作意见：
    在各河道上游（未出山口部分），支流繁多，应根据地形水势，大量开展水利灌溉工程，变旱地为水田；利用山洪放淤，改良土质，不但增加产量（放淤后一亩可顶二、三亩的产量），且能调节洪水，减少泥沙下泄，有利于下游治河工作，一举数得，如察南雁北、桑乾河、在沱河上游地区，很可大量发展，群众也有习惯。其次是成滩护滩工作：今年雨量大而集中，有些滩地被冲毁，有的护滩工程须加强，应利用冬闲，开石备料，以便成拥。
    在河道刚出山口后，河无山束，地形宽敞—，坡度骤缓，河道左冲右刷，危害很大。唐河、沙河、在沱河都有此害，应注意防治，约束河身，纳入正轨，不使为患。
    华北各河，大都经流河北平原（如南、北运河、永定河、大清河、子牙河等）而于天津附近汇入海河而入海。由于多年来泥沙淤积，河床高垫，河由地上行。又由于堤防年久失修，堤多低薄，更增加了洪水期间的漫决，为害很大。巩固堤防，还是目前救急有效办法（基本治法，堤防并非良策）。为了保障人民的生命财产，应组织力量，巩固险工，加培堤防，修筑可能出险地段。
    挑沟排水，改良耕地：有不少地方，因地势洼下，雨水汇集成灾；或因地势阴洼，不利作物生长，应进行实地踏勘测量，寻找出路，使水有所归，减少为害。但应注意顾此失彼现象。
    在平汉路两侧，地下水泄，应大力组织群众，广泛开展打井，购水车运动。
