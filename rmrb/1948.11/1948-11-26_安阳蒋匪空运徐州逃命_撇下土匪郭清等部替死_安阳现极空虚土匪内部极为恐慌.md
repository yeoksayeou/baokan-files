[Taihang Telegram] Delayed News: Since the People's Liberation Army occupied Zhengzhou and controlled the Yellow River Iron Bridge, the enemy's rear in northern Henan has been cut off by us. Chiang Kai-shek's troops entrenched in Anyang were already in a state of panic. Recently, Xuzhou has also been reported to be in dire straits, and Chiang Kai-shek had to rob Peter to pay Paul. On the 1st of this month, Liu Zhi, the commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang Xuzhou "Suppression Headquarters," personally arrived in Anyang. From the 2nd to the 7th of this month, he busily airlifted more than 6,000 enemy regular troops stationed in Anyang to Xuzhou, including the 39th Division headquarters, its directly subordinate 116th Regiment, 117th Regiment, artillery company, a supervisory battalion, the 4th company of the 2nd battalion of the 8th Artillery Regiment, and the 40th Army's directly subordinate transport battalion. When the Chiang bandits were transporting troops south, they staged a farcical drama, fully exposing the chaos and mutual deception of the Chiang bandits in the face of their demise. When the enemy was transferred south, the bandits Guo Qing, Liu Louxian, Cheng Daozeng, and others who stayed behind in Anyang did not allow the enemy's regular army to leave, especially not allowing Han Fengyi, the deputy commander of the enemy's 39th Division, to leave. It is said that bandit leaders such as Guo Qing threatened Han, saying, "If you want to leave, we will bombard the plane with artillery when it takes off." When Han tentatively tried to leave that day, a company of bandits followed him. Han did not dare to leave that day. Han had no choice but to secretly conspire with the Xuzhou "Suppression Headquarters." On the 7th of this month, he fabricated military intelligence, setting off guns and cannons to deceive the senior bandit officers, and hurriedly went to deploy for battle. Han then took the opportunity to take off and escape. Now, more than 8,000 bandits entrenched in Anyang are showing signs of wavering under the victorious offensive of our People's Liberation Army. Among the upper echelons, there is mutual infighting, scrambling for power and profit, and exploiting the people. The broad masses of lower-level officers and soldiers are increasingly awakening, realizing that no matter where they run, as long as they follow Chiang Kai-shek, they will eventually die, and they all hope that the People's Liberation Army will liberate them as soon as possible.
    
[Another Telegram] The Chiang bandits' 39th Division in Anyang were extremely embarrassed during the airlift escape from the 2nd to the 7th. The bandit leaders of the 117th Regiment and the 116th Regiment were all scrambling to leave first, even arguing. The enemy had no choice but to transport them in relays, one battalion at a time. Whenever a plane came, the new recruits who had just been captured at the airport were unwilling to leave their hometowns. The parents and wives of the new recruits were even more worried day and night that their loved ones would be transported away by Chiang Kai-shek to die. An old lady said, "These days, whenever a plane comes, I am stunned, not knowing where my child has been taken." The enemy stipulated that family members of officers above the regimental level could ride the plane for free, while family members of officers below the battalion commander level had to pay 150 silver dollars per person. Some lower-level officers did not have 150 silver dollars, so they had to shave their wives' heads, put on military caps, wear military uniforms, hang bullet bags, and carry rifles, pretending to be soldiers, and boarded the plane. The wife of one battalion commander did not have money when she boarded the plane, so the Chiang bandits pushed her off. The battalion commander pleaded repeatedly, but it was not allowed. This battalion commander's wife later shaved her head, put on a military uniform, and boarded the plane a second time, but the Chiang bandits discovered it and pushed her down again. One family member brought two children, but only had one plane ticket. The Chiang bandits did not allow the children to be carried on board, so the woman had no choice but to throw the one- or two-year-old and three- or four-year-old children into the airport, crying as she boarded the plane.

[Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram] The bandit Wang Sanzhu's troops, who had long occupied the border of our Fourth Military Region, attempted to flee south without success under the shock of the successive victories of our People's Liberation Army. Now, there is no other way out except to surrender or be annihilated. When our army liberated Zhengzhou and Kaifeng on the 23rd and 24th of last month, and drove the enemy in Zhengzhou to the northern part of the city to encircle and annihilate them, the 40th Division defending Xinxiang ordered Wang Sanzhu's bandit troops to guard the periphery of Xinxiang. In order to save his own life, Wang convened a high-level meeting of his subordinates on the 27th and decided to immediately flee south to Shangqiu. Because the Yellow River Iron Bridge was already controlled by our People's Liberation Army at this time, on the 28th, Wang personally led approximately 5,000 of his subordinates to reach Yanjin. On the 29th, they scurried to Lugang and Chenqiao (both belonging to Fengqiu), and planned to cross the river from Guantai (belonging to Quhe) and Niutou (belonging to Kunwu), and take the road to Kaocheng to Shangqiu. However, as soon as they scurried to Yanjin, they were constantly intercepted by our local county and district armed forces. On the 29th, the enemy also heard that all the enemy guarding Kaocheng had surrendered to us. On the 30th, they fled north in a panic. On the 31st, they scurried to the area west of Niushitun (belonging to Weinan County). From the 2nd to the 6th of this month, they returned to the vicinity of Xinxiang via Huaxian City, Daokou Town, and Xinzhen. Wang's bandits were extremely panicked during their flight, and they changed into civilian clothes one after another.

　　安阳蒋匪空运徐州逃命
  　撇下土匪郭清等部替死
    安阳现极空虚土匪内部极为恐慌
    【太行电】迟到消息：自人民解放军占领郑州，控制黄河大铁桥后，豫北敌人的后路被我切断，困守安阳的蒋匪本已慌慌不安，最近徐州又告吃紧，蒋匪只得拆东墙补西墙。本月一日，国民党徐州“剿总”总司令刘峙，曾亲到安阳。本月二日至七日忙将驻守安阳之敌正规部队、三十九师师部、及其直属的一一六团、一一七团、炮兵连与一个督导营、炮八团二营四连、四十军直属辎重营等共六千多人空运徐州。蒋匪在南运时，曾导演了一幕滑稽剧，充分暴露了蒋匪面临末日的混乱和相互欺骗的丑态。当敌南调时，留守安阳的土匪郭清、刘楼仙、程道增等，不让敌正规军走，特别是不让敌三十九师副师长韩凤仪走。据说，郭清等土匪头子，曾威胁韩说：“如要走，他们将在飞机起飞时，用大炮轰击。”当日韩试探走时，土匪曾有一连人跟随其后。韩当日终未敢走。韩匪无奈，乃与徐州“剿总”密订鬼计，于本月七日假造军情，自响枪炮欺骗土匪高级军官，慌忙去布署战斗，韩即乘机起飞逃走。现困守安阳的土匪八千余人，在我人民解放军的胜利攻势下，已呈动摇。上层之间，互相倾轧，争权夺利，鱼肉人民。广大的下层官兵已日益觉醒，认识到不管跑到哪里，只要跟着蒋介石，终将是死，都盼解放军早日解放他们。
    【又电】安阳蒋匪三十九师，在二至七日的空运偷跑中，极为狼狈。一一七团和一一六团匪首们，都是争着先走，甚至吵架。敌人只好一个营一个营的轮替运。每逢飞机来时，飞机场刚抓来的新兵，谁也不愿离开家乡，新兵的父母妻子更是日夜担忧自己的亲人被蒋介石运走去送死。一个老太太说：“这几天，飞机一来，我就傻了眼，不知把俺孩运到哪里了。”敌人规定团级以上军官家属坐飞机不拿钱，营长以下的军官家属一人都得出一百五十元银圆。有些下级军官没有一百五十元白银，只好把老婆头推光，戴上军帽，穿上军衣，挂上子弹袋，背上步枪，假装士兵，上了飞机。有一个营长的老婆，上了飞机没钱，蒋匪就把她推下，那营长再三哀求，亦不允许。这位营长老婆后来推光了头，穿了军装，第二次又上，蒋匪发觉，又被推下来了。有一个家属带了两个小孩，只有一个人的飞机票，蒋匪不准载上小孩，该女人只好把一、二岁的和三、四岁的两个小孩扔到飞机场内，哭着坐上了飞机。
    【冀鲁豫电】长期盘据我四分区边沿之土匪王三祝部，在我解放军节节胜利震惊之下，企图南逃未果，现在除了投诚或被消灭已别无出路。当上月二十三、四两日我军解放郑州、开封并将郑敌赶往城北地区进行围歼之时，新乡守敌四十师曾命令王三祝匪部护守新乡外围，而王匪为自逃活命，则于二十七日召开所属高级会议，决定立即南逃商邱，因此时黄河铁桥已为我解放军所控制，廿八日，王匪乃亲率所属约五千人到达延津，二十九日窜至鲁岗、陈桥（均封邱属），并拟由贯台（曲河属）扭头（昆吾属）等地过河，取道考城到商邱，但刚窜至延津后即遭我当地县区武装不断阻击，二十九日该敌又闻考城守敌全部向我投降，三十日又狼狈北逃。三十一日窜至牛市屯（卫南县属）以西地区，本月二日至六日乃经滑县城、道口镇、新镇等地，于五、六两日回至新乡附近。王匪在四窜途中极为恐慌，纷纷换穿便衣。
