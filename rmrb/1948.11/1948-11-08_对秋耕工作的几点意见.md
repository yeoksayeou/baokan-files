　　A Few Suggestions Regarding Autumn Plowing
    Peng Jianwen
  　I. Pay Attention to Autumn Plowing Techniques and the Care of Livestock

    Time is of the essence, and autumn plowing cannot be relaxed in the slightest. Moreover, with a large number of laborers and livestock supporting the front lines, the autumn plowing task is even busier. Under these circumstances, if the leadership does not pay close attention to grasping and inspecting the work, a "shock" approach with a single-minded focus on completing the task may arise, leading to rough plowing and a lack of care for livestock. In Licheng in 1943, in order to "compete and challenge," an autumn plowing "shock" was carried out. In some villages in the second and fifth districts, lanterns were lit at night to plow the fields, some plowing one furrow as deep as two, and some disregarded the life or death of the livestock, continuing the "shock" relentlessly. As a result, deep and meticulous plowing became rough and crude work, and many livestock were so exhausted that they refused to eat, causing serious dissatisfaction among the masses. This year, we should learn from this lesson and ensure that autumn plowing is not only done quickly but also well. Any simple "shock" approach that only focuses on completing the task and neglects to mobilize the masses to carry out good organizational work is harmful.

    II. Pay Attention to the Autumn Plowing of Family Members of Those Participating in the War

    Ensuring the completion of autumn plowing for family members of those participating in the war will, on the one hand, achieve the goal of leaving no land uncultivated, preparing for a large-scale production next year; on the other hand, it will stabilize the morale of the support-the-frontline laborers and ensure the completion of the support-the-frontline task. Therefore, we should educate and mobilize the masses well, paying attention to the attitude of some people who disregard the autumn plowing of family members of those participating in the war or deal with it perfunctorily, and truly ensure that supporting the front and production are not delayed.

    III. Pay Attention to Combining Manure Accumulation with Autumn Plowing

    After the autumn harvest, there are many rice husks and chopped stalks, and weeds and leaves are also withering and falling, providing ample conditions. The climate is still warm, and composting is easy to rot, making it a favorable opportunity for accumulating manure. The leadership should organize this work well, mobilizing women, children, and semi-laborers to carry out weeding and sweeping, soil fumigation, and composting. Without affecting the autumn plowing, we can also mobilize the masses to cut a large amount of artemisia, because most of the artemisia now has seeds, which rot very stinky and have good fertilizer quality. To achieve the goal of increasing production next year, preparing sufficient fertilizer is one of the important guarantees.

    IV. Settle Mutual Aid Wages in a Timely Manner to Lay the Organizational Foundation for Next Year's Production

    After the autumn plowing is completed, mutual aid wages should be settled in a timely manner, and should not be dragged on until next year to resolve leftover problems, which will affect the smooth development of mutual aid production next year. We should also, through summarizing the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, selecting models, mobilizing the masses, calculating family assets, and proposing production goals, smoothly transition to winter production.

　　对秋耕工作的几点意见
    彭建文
  　一、注意秋耕技术与畜力的爱护
    目前时已紧迫，秋耕工作不能有丝毫放松；又因大批劳畜力支援前线，更显得秋耕任务之繁忙。在此情况下，领导上如不很好注意掌握与检查，便会产生单纯完成任务观点的“突击”方式，以致发生耕作粗糙与不爱护畜力的现象。黎城在四三年为了“竞赛挑战”，进行秋耕“突击”，二、五区有些村黑夜打上灯笼犁地，有的是一犁顶两犁，有的不管牲口死活，一直“突击”，结果深耕细作变成粗耕粗作，许多牲口累的不吃，遭到群众严重不满。今年应该记取这个教训，使秋耕工作不但要做的快，而且要做的好。任何单纯完成任务，不注意发动群众进行很好组织工作的简单“突击”方式，都是有害的。
    二、注意参战人员家属的秋耕
    保证参战人员家属秋耕的完成，一方面是达到普遍不留一亩多地，为明年大生产作准备；另一方面是安定支前民工情绪，保证支援前线任务的完成。因此，应很好教育群众与发动群众，注意部分人不管参战人员的秋耕或草率粗糙的应付观点，真正做到支前生产两不耽误。
    三、秋耕中应注意结合积肥
    秋收以后，禾糠碎秆很多，杂草树叶也正在凋零纷飞，条件充足；目前气候尚暖，沤粪也易腐烂，正是积肥的有利机会。领导上应很好组织这件工作，发动妇女儿童半辅劳力，进行除草扫道，熏土沤肥；在不影响秋耕的条件下，也可发动群众大量割蒿，因为现在的蒿大都结籽，沤烂很臭，肥质较好，为达到明年增产目的，准备充足肥料是重要保证之一。
    四、及时清算互助工资，打下明年生产的组织基础
    秋耕结束后，应及时清算互助工资，不要把他拖＠下来，等到明年再去清理遗留问题，影响明年互助生产的顺利开展。并应通过总结秋收秋耕，评选模范，发动群众，计算家当，提出生产目标，顺利转上冬季生产。
