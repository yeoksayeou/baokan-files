(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) After a certain unit of the North China People's Liberation Army repelled the invading Chiang Kai-shek-Fu Zuoyi bandit troops, order quickly returned to normal in all the towns and villages along the Baoshi Line. The Kuomintang invading army, having suffered over a thousand casualties on both sides of the river, retreated towards Baoding on the first of this month. As the People's Liberation Army pursued the enemy, the militia rushed to repair the transportation routes that had been destroyed a few days earlier to obstruct the enemy. The militia repairing the roads discussed among themselves: "The Kuomintang army in the Northeast is finished! The People's Liberation Army is about to liberate all of North China! We must build the roads to Baoding and Beiping!" After three days of emergency repairs, all important transportation routes along the line have been restored and are open to traffic. The markets, which had been suspended for a time, have also returned to their usual prosperity. Farmers in Ding County, Xinle, Quyang, and Xingtang are now rushing to thresh grain to pay this year's public grain, and are launching crash efforts to sift peanuts, dig sweet potatoes, and carry out autumn ploughing. The militia in various counties, mobilized during the emergency preparations for war, are eager to go on expeditions. The mobilization of the militia in the various counties this time has been exceptionally rapid. For example, a month ago, Xingtang County already had four companies accompanying the army to attack Taiyuan, and recently it concentrated seven more companies to participate in the battle to defend the Baoshi Line. At the same time, it has prepared nineteen companies to be ready to go to the front at any time to provide support. The scale of the militia in other counties is also as strong as that of the Xingtang militia. They declare: "Whenever the People's Liberation Army attacks Ping, Tianjin, and Baoding, as soon as the order is given, we can all set out at any time!"

　　保石线迅速恢复常态
  　赶碾公粮突击秋耕
  　抢修交通准备支前
    【本报特讯】华北人民解放军某部打退了进犯的蒋傅匪军后，保石线上所有城镇乡村的秩序随即迅速恢复常态。在河两岸挨了打损兵折将千余人的国民党进犯军，已于本月一日向保定溃退，解放军在前面追击敌人，民兵们就在后面抢修数日之前为了阻击敌人而破坏了的交通要道。修路的民兵们互相议论：“东北的国民党军队完蛋了！解放军快要解放全华北了！咱们要把汽路修到保定、北平去！”经过三天来的抢修，沿线重要交通要道均已修复畅通。一度停滞的市亦已如常繁荣。定县、新乐、曲阳、行唐等县的农民现在正赶碾粮米，缴纳今年公粮；突击筛花生、刨红薯和秋耕。在紧急备战中动员起来的各县民兵，纷纷要求出征。此次各县民兵动员均异常迅速，如行唐民兵在一个月之前已有四个连随军去攻太原，最近又集中七个连参加保卫保石线战斗，同时准备好了十九个连以便随时出动支前。其他各县民兵的阵容亦与行唐民兵的阵容同样雄壮。他们宣称：“解放军什么时候打平、津、保定，命令一下，全体随时可以出动！”
