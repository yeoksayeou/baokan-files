　　From reports to this newspaper: In some areas of southern Hebei, it has been discovered that local Party organizations are only paying attention to Party consolidation and the conclusion of land reform, neglecting or abandoning leadership over winter production. Land reform work in the area has been basically completed, and the majority of farmers are demanding a shift to production. Therefore, Party consolidation and political construction must be combined with winter production, rather than carried out in isolation. However, some county and district cadres in the area still lack understanding of the principle of "restoring and developing production, and completing Party consolidation and political construction." During a twelve-day county-wide cadre meeting in Wei County, the county Party committee initially only planned to make three reports on Party consolidation, class division, and land reform, completely neglecting winter production. At the meeting, many cadres were anxious about how to solve the livelihood of people in disaster areas, the demands of people in old areas to engage in production, and the work for villages that have completed land reform this winter. It was not until the meeting was nearing its end, after various parties pointed it out, that the county Party committee raised the issue of winter production. In the Maling District of Yuanzhao County, most cadres were simply waiting for Party consolidation and land reform, lacking preparation for leading the masses to engage in sideline production. The Fifth District of Xiajin County also discovered the argument that "winter production does not need leadership," and the phenomenon of paying lip service to production at mass meetings without providing concrete leadership. Therefore, in some places, farmers would quietly hide away to do small business when they saw work teams coming, fearing that it would delay production.
　　In response to the above tendencies, the Jinnan Daily published an editorial, pointing out: The direct purpose of Party consolidation, political construction, and resolving outstanding issues of land reform is to improve the ideological awareness of Party members, strengthen the Party's connection with the masses, and improve the masses' enthusiasm for production, in order to carry out a large-scale production movement. Therefore, production work should be included in the overall plan of Party committees and work teams at all levels. The editorial specifically proposed: The tasks of the work teams are to lead production, implement democratic Party consolidation, announce the conclusion of land reform, and issue land certificates after inspection and individual compensation and adjustment to confirm land rights. The editorial called on all work teams to conduct repeated propaganda based on the Xinhua News Agency editorial "Take a Step Forward in Improving Agricultural Production in Liberated Areas," and called on farmers to become wealthy through production. At the same time, they should cooperate with village branches and village cadres to solve various specific problems in farmers' winter production. In Party consolidation and political construction, issues such as war services, substitute farming, cooperation, mutual aid, and agricultural loans that the masses urgently need to solve and are related to production must be resolved fairly and reasonably. Bad habits such as selfishness, self-interest, and coercion among some cadres and Party members should be corrected, and good habits of benefiting the people, eliminating malpractices, setting an example, being selfless and dedicated, and practicing diligence and thrift in production should be established. In the work, the production of farmers should be taken care of as much as possible, and unnecessary meetings should be reduced.

　　冀南部分地区孤立进行整党建政
  　忽视冬季生产领导
    【本报讯】冀南部分地区，发现党的地方组织只注意进行整党和结束土改工作，轻视或放弃领导冬季生产的偏向。该区土地改革工作已基本上完成，多数农民的要求是转入生产。因此，整党建政的工作必须和冬季生产相结合，而不应孤立地去进行。但该区若干县区干部，还对“恢复发展生产，完成整党建政工作”这一方针缺乏了解。威县中共县委在十二天的全县干部大会中，起初只准备作整党、划阶级、土改等三个报告，对今冬生产完全忽视。会上不少干部焦虑着如何解决灾区群众生活、老区群众要求搞生产、已结束土改的村庄今冬工作等问题。直到会议将近结束时，经各方指出，县委才提出冬季生产问题。元朝县马陵小区多数干部单纯等待整党和土改，缺乏领导群众作副业生产的准备。夏津县五区亦曾发现“冬季生产不用领导”的论调，和只在群众大会上空谈生产而不作具体领导的现象。因此，有些地方的农民，一见工作组去，就悄悄地躲出去作小生意，怕耽误生产。
    针对着上述偏向，冀南日报特发表社论，指出：整党、建政、解决土改遗留问题的直接目的，就是为了提高党员的思想觉悟，加强党与群众的联系，提高群众的生产积极性，以便开展大生产运动。因此，应把生产工作列入各级党委和工作组的整个计划中。该社论并具体提出：工作组的任务是领导生产，实行民主整党，宣布土改已经结束，经过检查和个别补偿、调剂之后，颁发土地证，确定地权。该社论要求各工作组应根据新华社社论“把解放区农业生产提高一步”，进行反复宣传，号召农民生产发家；同时，协同村支部、村干部解决农民冬季生产中的各种具体问题。在整党建政中，必须把群众当前迫切要求解决的与生产有关的战争勤务、代耕、合作、互助、农贷等问题公平合理地予以解决，并改正某些干部党员的自私自利、强迫命令的坏作风，树立为民兴利除弊、以身作则、克己奉公、勤俭生产的好作风。工作中应尽可能照顾农民的生产，减少不必要的会议。
