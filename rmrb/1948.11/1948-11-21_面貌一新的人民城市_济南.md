　　Jinan City, a city of 700,000 people, after more than a month of arduous efforts by the democratic government and its citizens since its liberation on September 23rd, has been transformed from a fascist prison of hunger, poverty, filth, chaos, and cold-bloodedness under the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang into a new and thriving people's city with good order.

　　The Military Control Commission, on the third day after the liberation of Jinan (September 26th), instructed the political affairs departments to quickly restore public order and establish order so that citizens could live and work in peace. Over the past month, with the joint efforts of cadres and the masses, the four urgent post-war tasks of burying corpses, taking in wounded and scattered soldiers, providing emergency relief, and leveling pillboxes have been completed first. According to preliminary statistics, more than 5,000 corpses have been buried, more than 440 pillboxes have been leveled, more than 3,600 wounded and scattered soldiers have been taken in, and 250,000 jin of relief grain have been distributed, providing relief to more than 20,450 unemployed workers and poor citizens who were unable to maintain their livelihoods. In the burial work, the cadres, regardless of the deep water and cold wind, took the lead in jumping into Daming Lake to salvage corpses. Some female cadres from the district governments also personally carried corpses to assist in burial. The citizens were moved and said, "The People's Liberation Army is not only lenient to the living, but also takes care of the dead in this way. It is truly a benevolent and righteous army!" After the pillboxes were leveled, traffic in the commercial port and urban areas was quickly restored. Many citizens found wood and door panels seized by the Chiang bandit army from the demolition and rebuilt their destroyed houses and sorted out their property.

　　Jinan's industry and commerce, which could not breathe under the oppression of exorbitant taxes and violent control during the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, has now awakened. Many factories have resumed work. The workers of Jinan Flour Mill, while working hard, have established a learning system, are enthusiastically studying Chairman Mao's "The Present Situation and Our Tasks," and are beginning to learn and gradually establish a new work attitude. Baofeng Flour Mill, a privately owned enterprise, also quickly resumed work with the help of the democratic government after liberation. It can now produce 100 bags of flour per hour (44 jin per bag). Other light industries, such as textiles, matches, and paper making, have also mostly resumed work. On Jing'er Road, the most prosperous area in Jinan, large and small shops and nationally renowned Hengdeli and Atlantic watch stores, Taikang Food Company, and others have opened for business one after another. The shop windows are full of goods, and customers are coming and going. This is in sharp contrast to the desolate scene before liberation. As agricultural products from Jinan's surrounding villages and Changqing, Feicheng, Tai'an, Liaocheng, Yucheng, Linyi, and other counties poured into the city, and urban and rural materials were freely exchanged, the soaring grain prices and general prices dropped significantly, and the citizens who had been trapped in hunger for a long time received a sufficient supply of grain.

　　The large, medium, and small schools in Jinan, which were severely damaged by the Kuomintang bandit gang, have now resumed classes one after another. Over the past month, the democratic government has overcome various difficulties, taking over and protecting schools, registering and employing teachers and staff, and distributing relief grain and money. At the same time, it has held educational symposiums, clarified educational policies, and actively supported the resumption of classes in schools. As of the end of October, a total of 91 public and private universities, middle schools, and primary schools in Jinan have resumed classes, including 16 secondary and higher schools such as Qilu University, Provincial Medical College, Agricultural College, Jinan Normal School, and Women's Normal School, and 75 primary schools. There are 914 teachers and staff and more than 7,000 students employed or studying in secondary and higher schools. In primary schools, 1,173 teachers are teaching, and more than 22,000 students have enrolled. The remaining schools are also being merged or preparing to resume classes.

　　The railway transportation事业事业 centered on Jinan is currently being actively restored. The East China Railway Administration was officially established on the first of this month. The first and second batches of more than 4,300 railway workers are carrying out emergency repair work. The Jinan-Yanzhou section of the Jinpu Railway has already been opened to traffic, and will soon reach Dezhou to the north. In addition, the Jiaoji West Section Road Construction Committee was also established on October 17th, and is now collecting steel rails, sleepers, and poles needed for the road reconstruction, striving to complete the traffic between Jinan and Wanxian before the end of this year.

　　During the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, unemployed workers and poor citizens in Jinan had fallen into a desperate situation of hunger. After liberation, in order to provide relief to them, the democratic government, in addition to implementing emergency relief, also issued small loans and organized them to engage in production. The Seventh District of Jinan City issued nearly 10 million Northern Currency in loans within a week. One guarantee of fifteen households in the Sixth District also issued 1.8 million yuan in loans at the end of October. The loan recipients included three unemployed workers, nine rickshaw pullers, and three military dependents. After receiving the loans, they immediately engaged in production to support their families through their own labor. These people who were hungry, cold, and had no way to seek help have now been revived under the rule of the democratic government, just like Jinan.

### 面貌一新的人民城市——济南

　　面貌一新的人民城市——济南
    七十万人民聚居的济南市，自九月二十三日解放后，经民主政府和市民们一个多月来的艰苦努力，已由国民党匪帮统治时期的一座饥饿贫困、肮脏混乱、冷酷阴森的法西斯牢狱，一变而为秩序井然、欣欣向荣的新生的人民城市了。
    军管会于济南解放后的第三天（九月二十六日），即责成政务部门从速恢复治安，确立秩序，使市民得以安居乐业。一个多月来，在干部群众一齐动手下，首先完成了掩埋尸体、收容伤俘散兵、急赈、平毁碉堡等战后四项紧急工作。据初步统计，共掩埋尸体五千余具，平毁碉堡四百四十余座，收容伤俘散兵三千六百余名，发放赈粮二十五万斤，使两万零四百五十多个无法维持生活的失业工人和贫苦市民得到救济。在掩埋工作中，干部们不顾水深风冷，带头跃入大明湖中打捞尸体。有些区政府的女干部，亦亲自动手抬运尸体，协助掩埋。市民们感动得说：“解放军不仅对活的宽大，对死的也这样的照顾，真是仁义之师！”平毁碉堡以后，商埠、城关的交通已迅速恢复。许多市民都从拆除中找到为蒋匪军抢去的木料门板，重新修筑他们被毁坏了的房屋，整理他们的家业。
    在国民党匪帮统治时，为苛捐杂税和暴力管制压得不能喘气的济南工商业，现在已经苏醒过来了。许多工厂已复工。济南面粉厂的职工们，一面努力工作，一面建立了学习制度，正在热烈地学习毛主席的“目前形势和我们的任务”，并开始学习和逐渐树立新的劳动态度。私人资本的宝丰面粉厂，解放后亦在民主政府帮助下迅速复工。现在每小时可产面粉一百包（每包四十四斤）。其余如纺织、火柴、造纸等轻工业，亦已大部复工。济南最繁华的经二路上，大大小小的商店和全国著名的享得利、大西洋钟表店、泰康食品公司等，都已先后开门营业。商店橱窗里摆满百货，顾客盈门。这和解放前那种冷落萧条的景象，成一尖锐的对照。由于济南四乡及长清、肥城、泰安、聊城、禹城、临邑等县的农产品涌入市内，城乡物资自由交流，使曾经狂涨的粮价和一般物价大大下降，久困饥饿中的市民，得到了充分的粮食供应。
    备受国民党匪帮摧残的济南大中小学校，现在也纷纷复课。一个多月来，民主政府克服种种困难，一面接管保护学校，登记录用教职员，发放救济粮金，一面召开教育座谈会，阐明教育方针，积极扶助学校复课。截至十月底止，济南全市已有公私立大、中、小学九十一所复课，其中包括齐鲁大学、省立医学院、农学院、济南师范、女子师范等中等以上学校十六所，小学七十五所。就业就学的中等以上学校教职员有九百十四名，学生有七千余人。小学则有教师一千一百七十三名执教，学生二万二千余名入学。其余学校也在分别合并或筹备复课中。
    以济南为中心的铁路交通事业，目前正在积极恢复中。华东区铁路管理总局已于本月一日正式成立。第一、二批四千三百余名铁路职工正在进行抢修工作。津浦路济、兖（州）段早已通车，不久又将北达德州。此外，胶济西段建路委员会亦已于十月十七日成立，现在搜集复路所需的钢轨、枕木和电杆，争取在本年底以前，完成济南、万县之间的通车。
    在国民党匪帮统治时，济南的失业工人和贫苦市民们，大家都已陷入饥饿的绝境。解放后，民主政府为了救济他们，除施行急赈外，并发放小本贷款，组织他们从事生产。济市第七区，一周之内即发出贷款北币近千万元。第六区一个保十五户，亦于十月底发出贷款一百八十万元。贷款户中包括三户失业工人，九户拉车工人，三户军属。他们得到贷款后，立即投入生产，以自己的劳动来养家活口。这些饥寒交迫、求告无门的人民，现在在民主政府治理下，也和济南一样得到苏生了。
