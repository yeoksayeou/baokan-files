    Dear Editor:
    Now that the land has been largely divided, and we are vigorously developing production and improving agricultural tools, we often see in the newspapers that using tractors for plowing is fast and good. How many types of tractors are there? Can small ones be used on three or five mu plots of land? What fuel do they use? How much land can they plow per day? What is the value of a small one? Can they be bought? Where can they be bought? We hope you can answer these questions!

    Answer: Tractors range in size from eight horsepower to fifty or sixty horsepower and above. In terms of type, there are general tractors, combine harvesters, and endless track tractors (wheels like those of a tank). It looks like a car with only a car head and no car body. A small tractor pulling a two-row plow can plow 50 mu of land per day, and pulling a four-row plow can plow 100 mu of land per day. A large machine with forty or fifty horsepower or more, pulling a six-row plow, can plow even more. A small tractor pulling a seeder can sow 280 to 320 mu per day. Carrying a threshing rake can thresh 6,000 jin of grain per hour. This increases productivity by dozens of times compared to the plows and drills we currently use. Tractors are already widely used in Soviet agriculture and have been very successful at our state farms in the Northeast. In North China, the government used tractors to reclaim wasteland in southern Hebei with high efficiency.

    In addition, there is a small hand-held tiller, which is a combination of a plow and a small engine. One person can hold the plow from behind and plow about 10 mu of land per day. Although this tiller is far less efficient than a tractor, it is light and suitable for use on small plots of land.

    These machines use gasoline or alcohol as fuel, and can also be converted to burn charcoal, but burning charcoal damages the machines easily and reduces efficiency. Based on current prices, it costs about 3,000 yuan (Hebei currency) to plow one mu of land with a tractor. It is still difficult to estimate the price of each type of tractor.

    In the future, in order to further help farmers get rid of poverty and become prosperous on the basis of land reform, we must mechanize agriculture and replace our plows, drills, and other agricultural tools with tractors and other agricultural machinery to increase labor productivity. The government is now conducting typical tractor use experiments and training drivers and maintenance personnel. Once our heavy industry develops and produces a large number of tractors, they can be promoted and used by the masses. In terms of using tractors, because our land is quite scattered and often uneven, and tractors are highly efficient and not suitable for plowing on uneven and scattered plots of land (plowing on small plots of land is time-consuming and fuel-intensive), everyone needs to organize and properly repair each family's land so that everyone can reasonably use tractors together.

### 咱啥时用拖拉机耕田？小块土地能不能使用？

专栏：询问与答覆

    咱啥时用拖拉机耕田？小块土地能不能使用？编辑同志：
    现在土地大部已平分了，今后大力发展生产，改良农具，时常见到报上所说的用拖拉机耕地又快又好，究竟拖拉机共有多少种？小型的在三亩或五亩的地块上是否能用？用什么燃料？每日能耕多少地？小型的价值多少？是否能买到？到何处去买？这些问题请解答为盼！
                                        获鹿县农会  冯友贤
    答：拖拉机有从八个马力到五、六十个马力以上的大小之别，在种类上又有一般拖拉机，联合机，无限轨道拖拉机（轮子和坦克车的轮子一样）之不同。它的样子好象没有车身光有车头的汽车。小型的拖拉机拉着二行犁每天可耕地五十亩，拉着四行犁每天上耕地百亩。四五十个马力以上的大型机拉着六行犁，则耕得更多。小型的拖拉机拉着播种机每天即播种二百八十亩到三百二十亩。带着打谷扒一点钟即可打谷六千斤，这比起我们现在使用的犁耧等农具来，把生产力提高到数十倍以上。苏联的农业早已普遍地使用着拖拉机。我们东北的国营农场也使用着拖拉机，很为成功。在华北，政府曾在冀南用拖拉机开荒，效率很高。
    此外还有一种小型的手提耕田机，是以一部耕犁和一部小型发动机联合而成，一人在后扶犁，每天可耕地十亩左右。这种耕田机在效率上虽远较拖拉机为低，但因轻便，宜于在小块地上使用。
    这些机器都用汽油或酒精做燃料，经过改装也可以烧木炭，但是烧木炭机器容易坏，效率也低。按现在物价计算，用拖拉机耕一亩地约需三千元（冀钞）左右。各式拖拉机每部各价多少，现在还很难估计。
    我们将来为了使农民在土改的基础上进一步摆脱穷困，富裕起来，必须把农业机械化，把我们的犁、耧等农具改用拖拉机等农业机器，提高劳动生产力，现在政府正在做拖拉机典型使用试验，并训练驾驶和修理的人员，一待将来我们的重工业发展起来，生产出大批的拖拉机便可向群众推广使用。在使用拖拉机上，因为我们的土地相当分散，又往往高低不平，而拖拉机是效率高，不适于在高低不平的零星地块上耕作的（在小块地上耕作费时费油），所以须要大家组织起来，把各家的地适当的加以修整，才可以合理的大家共同使用拖拉机。
