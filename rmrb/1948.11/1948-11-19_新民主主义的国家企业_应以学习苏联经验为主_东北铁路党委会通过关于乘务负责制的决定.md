　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 15th—In the state-owned enterprises of the New Democracy, when learning from the experiences of industrially advanced countries, should we primarily learn from the experiences of socialist Soviet Union, or from the experiences of capitalist countries? The decision on implementing the crew responsibility system (generally known as the "package train system") on Northeast Railways, passed by the Northeast Railway Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, provides a clear answer to this important and principled question. The crew responsibility system is a special issue in railway management, but the principles it involves are universal and worthy of attention by all management and trade union workers in state-owned enterprises. The full text of the decision is as follows:

　　(1) The Northeast Railway Party Committee fully agrees with the resolution passed by the recent Northeast Railway Locomotive Conference on implementing the crew responsibility system (generally known as the "package train system") and abolishing the rotational crew system throughout the railway. We believe that this resolution resolves an extremely important principle in railway operations.

　　(2) The advantages and disadvantages of the crew responsibility system and the rotational crew system, two opposing systems, have not only been proven by the actual results of the Mudanjiang Railway Bureau's experiments, but also have been clearly concluded in the Soviet Union long ago. The Soviet railways adopted the crew responsibility system, which is a responsibility system built on the basis of the workers' consciousness, that is, a certain number of crew members (two or three shifts) are fixedly assigned to use a locomotive, and they are fully responsible for the locomotive. The implementation of this system will inevitably enhance the crew's sense of responsibility, care, and creativity towards the locomotive, keep the locomotive in good condition, thus prolonging the locomotive's life and increasing the locomotive's traction and work efficiency. The railways in capitalist countries adopt the rotational crew system, that is, each locomotive in the entire section is used in rotation by all the crew groups in the entire section, and more inspectors are added to check the condition of the locomotive; the implementation of this system will inevitably greatly reduce the crew's sense of responsibility and care for the locomotive, thus increasing the locomotive's damage and failure rate, and reducing the locomotive's life and usage efficiency. Railways in capitalist countries cannot adopt the crew responsibility system and have no choice but to adopt the rotational crew system because they cannot trust the crew to be fully responsible for the locomotive.

　　(3) The crew responsibility system is the specific manifestation of the responsibility system in locomotive crew work. We should establish a direction that the principle of the responsibility system should be gradually applied to all aspects of work (such as the machine responsibility system, the responsibility system for dispatching vehicles, etc.).

　　(4) From the results of studying the crew system over the past year, we should draw the conclusion that when we learn from the experience of various countries in managing railways, we should mainly learn from the experience of the Soviet Union and apply these experiences to the specific conditions of Chinese railways. Because, first, our New Democratic country's railways, in terms of their essence of being owned by the people, serving the people, and having no exploitative relationships within the railway, are consistent with the Soviet railways and are the opposite of the railways in capitalist countries. Second, in the process of 30 years of construction, the Soviet railways have already critically absorbed the experience of capitalist countries in managing railways. Our special emphasis on Soviet experience can save us from taking detours. Of course, the experience of capitalist countries in managing railways can also be used for our reference, discarding its harmful parts and absorbing its useful parts. However, we must never equate the experience of capitalist countries in railway management with the experience of Soviet railway management, and we must adhere to the principle of mainly learning from the experience of the socialist Soviet Union in ideology and in practical measures.

　　(5) From the issue of the crew system, we should also draw another conclusion: we should have a humble and studious attitude and a keen sense of fresh things and advanced scientific theories, and we should prevent and overcome the outdated and backward parts of being confined to the experience of the old railways, the problems of empiricism and conservatism (of course, the useful parts of the old railway experience can and should be adopted).

　　(6) Party organizations at all levels should organize discussions on this decision in a planned way, implement the spirit of the responsibility system into various specific tasks, and check and eliminate any phenomena of no one being responsible. We should carry out profound education among the crew members so that everyone understands that the state has entrusted them with the most valuable property—locomotives—for their responsible use, and they should respond to the state's supreme trust in them with the attitude of masters, that is, a high sense of responsibility and initiative.

### 新民主主义的国家企业　应以学习苏联经验为主  东北铁路党委会通过关于乘务负责制的决定

　　新民主主义的国家企业
  　应以学习苏联经验为主
    东北铁路党委会通过关于乘务负责制的决定
    【新华社哈尔滨十五日电】在新民主主义的国家企业中，在学习工业先进国的经验时，应该以学习社会主义苏联的经验为主？还是以学习资本主义国家的经验为主？这个重要的带原则性的问题，在中共东北铁路党委会所通过的关于东北铁路实行乘务负责制的决定中，作了明确的解答。乘务负责制是铁路管理工作中的特殊问题，但是它所涉及的原则是有普遍性的，值得一切国家企业中的管理工作者和工会工作者的注意。该决定全文如下：
    （一）东北铁路党委完全同意最近东北各铁路机务会议所通过的关于在全路实行乘务负责制（一般称为包车制），废除轮乘制的决议案。我们认为这一决议案解决了铁路业务上极其重要的一个原则问题。
    （二）乘务负责制与轮乘制两种相反的制度的利害，不仅为牡丹江局实际试验的结果证明，而且在苏联对于这个问题早已做了明确的结论。苏联铁路采用乘务负责制，这种制度是建筑在劳动者的自觉基础上的负责制，即由一定数量的乘务员（二班或三班）固定地使用一台机车，由他们对机车负全责。实行这种制度的结果，必然增强乘务员对于机车的责任心、爱护心和创造性，使机车保持良好状态，因而延长机车寿命，增加机车的曳引力和工作效率。资本主义国家的铁路则采用轮乘制，即将全段的每台机车给全段的乘务组轮流使用，同时增多检点员来检查机车的状态；实行这种制度的结果，必然大大减低乘务员对机车的责任心与爱护心，因而增加机车的破损故障率，减低机车的寿命和使用效率。资本主义国家的铁路不能采用乘务员负责制，不能不采用轮乘制，因为他不可能信任乘务员对机车负全责。
    （三）乘务员负责制是负责制在机车乘务工作上的具体表现。应该确定这样一个方向，负责制的原则应当逐步地运用到各方面工作上去（例如机器的负责制，调度车辆工作的负责制等）。
    （四）从一年来研究乘务制度的结果中，应当得出这样一个结论：我们学习世界各国管理铁路的经验，主要地应当学习苏联的经验，把这些经验根据中国铁路的具体情况加以运用。因为第一，我们新民主主义国家的铁路就其为人民所有、为人民服务和铁路内部没有剥削关系这一本质来说，是和苏联的铁路一致的，是和资本主义国家的铁路相反的。第二，苏联铁路在三十年来的建设过程中，对于资本主义国家管理铁路的经验，早已批判地加以吸收。我们特别重视苏联的经验，可以使我们少走弯路。当然资本主义国家管理铁路的经验，亦可供我们的参考，舍去其有害部分，吸取其可用部分。但是，决不应当把资本主义国家铁路管理的经验和苏联铁路管理的经验等量齐观，应当在思想上和在实际措施上坚持主要学习社会主义国家苏联的经验的原则。
    （五）从乘务制度这一问题上还应当得出另一个结论，我们对于新鲜的事物，先进的科学理论，应当具有虚心钻研的态度和敏锐的感觉，应该防止和克服拘泥于旧铁路的经验中的陈旧和落后的部分，那种经验主义和保守主义的毛病（当然，旧铁路经验中有用的部分可以而且应当采用）。
    （六）各级党的组织对这个决定，应当有计划地组织讨论，将负责制的精神贯彻到各项具体工作中去，检查和消灭任何无人负责的现象。应当在乘务员中间进行深刻的教育，使大家了解，国家把最宝贵的财产——机车交给他们负责使用，他们就应当以主人翁的态度，即高度的责任感和积极性，来回答国家对他们的无上信任。
