Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th -- The people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of Chahar Province are on the verge of extinction and starvation under the plunder and extortion of the bandit Fu Zuoyi. According to the Tianjin Dagongbao of September 22nd, the Speaker of the Kuomintang Chahar Provincial Assembly and others told reporters in Beiping on September 21st: "This province has contributed manpower, money, and food. The burden has been very heavy for the past year. The able-bodied are almost extinct, and the food is almost exhausted." The same newspaper revealed that Jiang and Fu plundered a total of 1.06 million shi of grain in the area this year, accounting for 51.82 percent of the farmers' harvest. In addition, Fu's 20 security regiments had to extort locally, requiring a total of 48 trillion [currency unit not specified] annually, not including other exorbitant taxes. Accompanying the grain requisition was a frenzy of conscription. Of the 2.4 million people in Chahar Province, only a little over 1 million are in Fu’s controlled area, and as many as 150,000 have been conscripted.

    察省国民党统治区濒于丁绝粮竭境地
    【新华社陕北三十日电】察哈尔省国民党统治区人民在傅匪作义掠夺搜刮下已濒于丁绝粮竭的境地。据九月廿二日津大公报载：国民党察省参议会议长等，九月二十一日在北平招待记者称：“本省出人、出钱、出粮，一年来负担甚重，壮丁几绝，粮食几竭。”同报披露：蒋、傅今年在该地区掠夺的粮食，共达一百零六万石之多，占农民收获量百分之五十一点八二。此外，傅匪二十个保安团还要就地搜刮，全年共需四十八万亿，其他苛杂尚未计入。伴随着征粮俱来的，就是疯狂抓丁。察省二百数十万人口中，傅匪统治区仅一百余万，而被征的竟达十五万名。
