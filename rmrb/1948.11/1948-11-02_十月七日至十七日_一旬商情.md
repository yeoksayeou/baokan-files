    Ten-Day Market Report
    Huabei Maozong Ziliao Shi

    Over the past ten days, in the inland areas of North China, the exchange of goods has been smooth due to the completion of the autumn harvest, and the market has generally been active. Due to different specific conditions in various regions, the performance of various goods has fluctuated, but in general, grain still leads the way and is more active, followed by cotton; due to seasonal factors, native cloth is also active; oil and salt are stable; imported goods: matches show an increase (in some areas), while paper and soda ash have fallen. In the neighboring liberated areas of Bohai and Jin-Sui, this year's harvest is abundant, agricultural materials have increased, and oil and grain are weak, while cotton and cloth are expensive in the Jin-Sui area. The specific situation of the main market commodities in the North China Liberated Area in the past ten days is reported as follows:

            Grain
    The sharp rise in southern Hebei in the previous ten days has turned into a decline, while Taihang has turned from a fall to a rise. Due to the breach of the Yellow River in the Zhangqiu area of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the masses are busy with construction, the supply of grain to the market has decreased, and the price is still rising. The eastern part of central Hebei, affected by the fall in grain prices in Bohai, has turned from a sharp rise in the previous ten days to a sharp fall, while the western part is still stable. Jin-Sui is generally stable, Bohai is falling, and other places fluctuate. In Puyang, from September 28 to October 8, rice and wheat turned around, while miscellaneous grains (red sorghum and corn) still rose by 11.5%. In Zhangqiu and Zhuxian, rice and wheat rose by 4-5%. In the southern Hebei area, from the 5th to the 13th, wheat in Linqing was flat, rice fell by 9%, red sorghum fell by 4.5%, rice in Nangong was flat, wheat fell by 4%, red sorghum fell by 6%, and black beans fell by 15%.

In central Shanxi, the masses have recently been busy supporting the front, and the supply of grain to the market is abnormal, and grain prices have fluctuated. From the 2nd to the 15th in Yuci, millet rose by 34%, wheat was flat, corn fell by 33%, red sorghum fell by 15%, and black beans rose by 0.8%. In the western Taihang and eastern Taiyue, it rained for several days at the beginning of the month, the supply of grain to the market decreased, and prices rose.

(2) Millet, red sorghum, and corn are more active, wheat is flat, and beans generally fall, while the neighboring liberated areas show a stable trend.

            Cotton and Native Cloth
    The cotton and cloth in the area continue the situation of the previous ten days, generally fluctuating with the rise and fall of grain, but native cloth is slightly more active than before due to seasonal factors. In Jin-Sui, both cloth and cotton rose, while in Bohai, cotton was flat and cloth rose (Linyi rose by 4.9%). In southern Hebei, some of the cotton and cloth went east to the Jiaodong area, and the rest of the cotton was mostly sold to local ginneries and flower shops.

Sanguang matches in Handan rose by 5,000 yuan per box, in Linqing rose by 157 yuan per package, and in Cangxian rose by 120 yuan per package. Northwest matches in Taihang and Taiyue are still flat at 800-900 yuan per package, and locally produced matches in central Hebei are flat at 500 yuan per package. Paper and soda ash have fallen.
