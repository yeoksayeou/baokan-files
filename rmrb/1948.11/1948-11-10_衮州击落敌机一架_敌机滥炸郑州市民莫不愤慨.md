Xinhua News Agency, East China, 8th: A delayed dispatch from 衮州: On the 29th of last month, our city defense forces in 衮州 shot down a US-made Kuomintang plane. At 11:30 AM that day, two enemy planes flew low over 衮州, strafing. One of them was hit by our forces, the fuselage crashed to the ground and burned, and one pilot was killed. The plane was a Wei Wu Yi model, number 7011.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Zhengzhou, 5th: US-made Kuomintang planes have been bombing the city indiscriminately for days, bombing peaceful citizens. At 9:30 AM on the 4th, six enemy bombers attacked, dropping more than ten bombs. On the morning of the 5th, seven enemy planes attacked again. The democratic municipal government has implemented emergency air defense measures, and order in the city has been excellent during and after the air raids. The people of the whole city are extremely indignant at the Kuomintang reactionaries for once again resorting to the shameless atrocities of indiscriminately bombing the people as they did previously in Kaifeng.
