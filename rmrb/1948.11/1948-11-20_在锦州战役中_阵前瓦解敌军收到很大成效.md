Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 18th: The work of disintegrating the enemy before battle proved very effective in the Jinzhou Campaign. Before the battle, a certain blocking force of the People's Liberation Army set up many propaganda signs in front of the position. Along the roads the enemy might take, slogans for disintegrating the enemy were posted everywhere, such as "Please stop, don't die a dog's death!" "Whom are you selling your lives for?" "Turn your guns around and shoot the supervisors!" "The guns are American, but the lives are your own!" and so on. The loudspeaker team used appropriate opportunities, such as when the enemy was compressed by us, when they were fleeing in a panic after being attacked by us and we were pursuing them, when their retreat route was cut off or when they were divided and surrounded by us, and when the enemy was only making local resistance, to broadcast according to the situation at the time. They also used propaganda shells to send propaganda materials to the enemy's positions. Because of the flexible execution of this work to disintegrate the enemy, the morale of those enemies who had already been frightened out of their wits was even lower, and they laid down their weapons more quickly and with less hesitation. The prisoners said, "When we saw the words written on the People's Liberation Army's signs, we wanted to go back." "After seeing your propaganda materials, we felt relieved when we handed over our guns."

　　在锦州战役中
  　阵前瓦解敌军
  　收到很大成效
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】阵前瓦解敌军工作，在锦州战役中证明很有成效。战斗前，解放军某阻击部队即在阵前设置许多宣传牌。在敌人可能经过的道路上，沿途遍贴瓦解敌军标语，如“请诸位止步，免作屈死鬼！”“请问为谁卖命？”“倒转枪口，打死督战者！”“枪是美国的，命是自己的！”等等。喊话组则利用适当时机，如当敌人被我压缩之时，遭我打击狼狈逃窜为我尾追之时，被我切断退路或被我分割、包围之时，以及敌仅作局部抵抗之时等，根据当时情况进行喊话。并用宣传弹把宣传品打到敌阵地上去。由于灵活地进行了这些瓦解敌军的工作，使那些已被打得丧魂落魄的敌人，土气更加低落，更快和更少顾虑的放下武器。俘虏们说：“我们看到解放军牌上写的话，我们就想往回走。”“看到你们的宣传品后，交枪时就放了心。”
