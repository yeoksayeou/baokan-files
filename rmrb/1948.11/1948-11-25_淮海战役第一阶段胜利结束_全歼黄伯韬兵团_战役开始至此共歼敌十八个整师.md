Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 22nd - The entirety of the Kuomintang army's Huang Botao Corps in the Nianzhuang area, over a hundred miles east of Xuzhou, was completely eliminated by 5:00 PM on the 22nd, with no one escaping. The first stage of the Huaihai Campaign, which began on the 7th of this month, has now concluded. In this first stage of sixteen days, the Kuomintang army has lost eighteen whole regular divisions (excluding irregular forces), namely ten divisions from five armies of the Huang Botao部 Corps, two divisions from one army of the Sun Liangcheng部 Corps, one division from the Liu Ruming部 Corps, one division of the garrison troops in Suxian, and four divisions from two armies of the Feng Zhian部 Corps, most of which revolted under the leadership of Generals He Jifeng and Zhang Kexia, and a small part of which was annihilated by the People's Liberation Army. The annihilation of the Huang Botao Corps has great significance for the future development of the Huaihai Campaign. This corps was originally located in the area between the Grand Canal and Haizhou in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. Upon hearing of our army's movement, it fled westward overnight. Just after crossing the Grand Canal, it was blocked by the powerful forces of the People's Liberation Army, which had penetrated the defense zone of the Feng Zhian部 Corps through Lin, Zao, Yi, and Tai, and directly inserted into the eastern side of Xuzhou, preventing it from escaping. Our main force quickly caught up from between Haizhou and the Grand Canal, and the enemy's main force of four armies was immediately compressed into the Nianzhuang Railway Station and its northern area, which was less than ten miles across. The two divisions of the 63rd Army of the Huang Corps, which detoured westward south of the Grand Canal Railway Station, were annihilated as early as the 12th. The enemy in Nianzhuang, the 25th Army, 44th Army, 64th Army, and 100th Army of the Huang Botao Corps, were trapped and awaiting reinforcements. Chiang Kai-shek and Liu Zhi dispatched the Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi Corps, consisting of fifteen divisions from six armies, from Xuzhou to the east for reinforcements starting on the 10th. The People's Liberation Army deployed to intercept them. The two corps advanced step by step with a large force, suffering heavy casualties and the annihilation of some units. In total, they traveled about thirty Chinese miles in eleven full days, still more than forty Chinese miles away from Nianzhuang, watching as the entire Huang Botao army was annihilated. The only product of Chiang Kai-shek's reinforcement plan this time was a series of dream talks such as the so-called "total collapse of the communist bandits" and "great victory of the national army" that the Central News Agency had been clamoring about for days. The Kuomintang had eight corps in the Xuzhou-Bengbu area, totaling sixty-six regular divisions including those directly under Liu Zhi. Except for those annihilated and those who revolted, they are now divided into northern and southern parts. On the Xuzhou side are ten divisions of Qiu Qingquan, seven divisions of Li Mi, four divisions of Sun Yuanliang, and one division directly under Liu Zhi. On the Bengbu side are eleven divisions of Huang Wei, five divisions of Liu Ruming, nine divisions of Li Yannian, and one division guarding Lingbi. Among them, about ten divisions have relatively strong combat power, while the rest are very weak.
Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 22nd - The People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the Kuomintang army's Huang Botao Corps of five armies and ten divisions, victoriously concluding the first stage of the Huaihai Campaign. The offensive of the People's Liberation Army is continuing to expand. This campaign began on the 7th of this month, and as of the 22nd, in sixteen days, the Kuomintang regular forces annihilated and revolted have reached eighteen whole divisions. The seriously damaged Fifth Army of Qiu Qingquan, the Ninth Army of Li Mi, and the Forty-first Army of Sun Yuanliang were not included. The enemy divisions and above annihilated included: the entire 25th Army (40th Division, 108th Division), 44th Army (150th Division, 162nd Division), 63rd Army (52nd Division, 186th Division), 64th Army (156th Division, 159th Division), 100th Army (44th Division, 63rd Division), 107th Army (260th Division, 261st Division), a total of six armies and twelve divisions; the entire 181st Division of the 55th Army and the 148th Division under the 25th Army, a total of fourteen complete divisions. The enemy forces who revolted included: the entire 59th Army (38th Division, 180th Division) of the Third Pacification Zone, the entire 132nd Division of the 77th Army, one regiment and one battalion of the 37th Division of that army, totaling three divisions, one regiment, and one battalion. Together with another regiment and two battalions of the 37th Division that refused to revolt and have been annihilated, a total of two armies and four divisions. During this period, the recovered and liberated county towns include: Shangqiu, Dangshan, Haizhou, Tancheng, Yixian, Pixian, Yutai, Shanxian, Caoxian, Fengxian, Peixian, Yucheng, Suining, Yongcheng, Suxian, Xiaoxian, Guanyun, and other seventeen cities; Railway stations: Huang Kou, Ma Mu Ji, Da Xu Jia, Grand Canal Station, Wa Yao, Xin An Zhen, Lin Cheng, Han Zhuang, Li Guo Yi, Liu Quan, San Bao, Jia Gou, Fu Li Ji, Ren Qiao, Gu Zhen, etc.; Mining areas: Zaozhuang, Jiawang, and the important military port of Lianyungang. Control of approximately 720 Chinese miles of the east-west sections of the Longhai Railway and approximately 350 Chinese miles of the north-south sections of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Other battle results are being cleared.

　　淮海战役第一阶段胜利结束
  　全歼黄伯韬兵团
    战役开始至此共歼敌十八个整师
    【新华社淮海前线二十二日电】徐州以东百余里碾庄地区的国民党军黄伯韬兵团全部，已于二十二日下午五时全部解决，无一漏网。淮海战役的第一阶段，自本月七日开始，至此已告结束。在此第一阶段的十六天中，国民党军已丧失了他的正规军（非正规军未计在内）十八个整师，即黄伯韬部五个军十个师，孙良诚部一个军两个师，刘汝明部一个师，宿县守军一个师，与大部由何基沣、张克侠两将军率领起义，小部由解放军歼灭之冯治安部两个军四个师。黄伯韬兵团的覆没，对于淮海战役今后的发展有巨大意义。该兵团原位陇海东段运河至海州间地区，一闻我军出动，即星夜西窜，刚过运河，即被由临、枣、峄、台穿过冯治安部防地直插徐州东侧之强大解放军兵力所堵住，逃归不得。我主力从海州运河间迅速赶上，敌主力四个军当即被我压缩在纵横不及十华里之碾庄车站及其北侧地区。其由运河车站以南绕道西窜之黄兵团六三军两个师早在十二日即被歼灭。碾庄之敌黄兵团二十五军、四十四军、六十四军、一百军则困守待援。蒋介石和刘峙于十日起，即派邱清泉、李弥两兵团六个军十五个师由徐州向东增援，人民解放军则布阵阻击。该两兵团以庞大兵力一步一跌地前进，走了十一个整天，付出大批伤亡及部分被歼灭的代价。总共走了三十个华里左右，距碾庄尚有四十余里，眼看着黄伯韬全军覆没。蒋介石这次增援计划的唯一产物，就是中央社所连日喧嚷的所谓“共匪总崩溃”，“国军伟大胜利”等一连串的梦话。国民党在徐蚌地区有八个兵团，连同刘峙直属者共计六十六个正规师，除被歼及起义者外，现被分割为南北两部分。在徐州方面者为邱清泉十个师、李弥七个师、孙元良四个师、刘峙直属一个师。在蚌埠方面者为黄维十一个师、刘汝明五个师、李延年九个师及守备灵璧一个师。其中十个师左右战力较强，其余都是很弱的。
    【新华社淮海前线二十二日电】人民解放军全部歼灭了国民党军黄伯韬兵团五个军十个师，胜利地结束了淮海战役的第一阶段。现人民解放军的攻势正继续扩张中。此次战役开始于本月七日，截至二十二日止，十六天中，国民党军正规部队被歼及起义者已达十八个整师，其他受重大打击的邱清泉部第五军、李弥部第九军、孙元良部第四十一军等均未计算在内。敌军整师以上被歼者计：二十五军（四十师、一零八师），四十四军（一五零师、一六二师），六十三军（五二师、一八六师），六十四军（一五六师、一五九师），一百军（四十四师、六十三师），一零七军（二六零师、二六一师）等六个军十二个师全部，五十五军之一八一师及二十五军所属之一四八师等两个师全部，共计十四个整师。敌军起义者计：三绥区之五十九军（三十八师、一八零师）全部，七十七军之一三二师全部，该军三十七师之一个团及一个营合计三个师一个团一个营。连同拒绝起义已被歼灭的三十七师之另一个团两个营，合共为两个军四个师全部。在此期间，收复及解放县城：商邱、砀山、海州、郯城、峄县、邳县、鱼台、单县、曹县、丰县、沛县、虞城、睢宁、永城、宿县、萧县、灌云等十七座；车站：黄口、马牧集、大许家、运河站、瓦窑、新安镇、临城、韩庄、利国驿、柳泉、三堡、夹沟、符离集、任桥、固镇等处；矿区：枣庄、贾汪，及重要军港连云港。控制陇海铁路东西两段约七百二十里，津浦铁路南北两段约三百五十里。其他战果正清查中。
