    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 31st: Moscow dispatch: Both Pravda and Izvestia published special issues on the 24th, carrying the full text of the decision by the Soviet government and the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) regarding the plan to conquer drought and strive for bumper harvests every year, and published huge maps to illustrate it. Pravda published an editorial entitled "Striving for Bumper Harvests Every Year," saying: "The Party and government's plan to overcome drought eloquently demonstrates the superiority of the socialist economic system, the power of the Soviet state, and the strength and vitality of collective farms. Only when the state possesses enormous strength and resources can it undertake this great task, unprecedented in agricultural history. Under the capitalist private land system, insurmountable obstacles exist in the face of such a task, and only the collective farm system can eliminate these obstacles. The socialist system has unfolded a vast and boundless prospect for developing land productivity. Under the capitalist system, there is nothing, and there can be nothing, comparable to it. Capitalism not only cannot systematically transform nature, but it cannot even avoid the destructive effects on natural wealth. In the United States, the fertility of the soil is declining. The destructive reduction of American forests has resulted in the deterioration of the soil to such an extent that large areas of the United States are in danger of becoming barren wasteland. In this situation, how pathetic are the attempts of bourgeois eulogists to prove the superiority of the capitalist system! Let the capitalists try to implement a plan to transform nature, even a small part of it, like the Soviet Union is doing now! This great plan will be fully realized in the shortest possible time in the socialist country. The offensive against drought launched by the Lenin-Stalin Party and the Soviet government will unite and lead millions of land tillers to fight for bumper harvests every year and to completely conquer the forces of nature. The years of drought threat that have enveloped the grasslands and forest-grassland areas for centuries will be gone forever. Farmland that has recently suffered from hot winds will flourish under any climatic conditions and will have bumper harvests every year. Our descendants will forever be grateful to the Lenin-Stalin Party for this wise decision to transform nature. They will never forget that our generation has entered the struggle solely against nature and created the conditions for increasing production and building communism."

    苏联征服旱灾伟大计划证明社会主义制度优越
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】莫斯科讯：真理报及消息报于二十四日同时出版专刊，刊载苏联政府及联共中央关于征服旱灾、争取年年丰收计划的决定全文，并刊载巨幅地图说明。真理报以“争取年年丰收”为题发表社论说：“党和政府所制订的这个战胜旱灾的计划，雄辩地说明了社会主义经济制度的优越性、苏维埃国家的威力及集团农场的力量与活力。只有当国家拥有巨大的力量与资源的时候，才能担负起这个在农业史上前所未闻的伟大任务。在资本主义的私有土地制度下，在这样任务的面前存在着不可克服的障碍，只有集体农场制度才能消除这些障碍。社会主义制度已经展开了发展土地生产力的广阔无边的远景。在资本主义制度下，是没有、而且也不可能有什么东西可以和它比拟的。资本主义不但不能有计划地改造自然，甚至也不能避免对自然财富的毁灭性的作用。在美国，土壤的肥沃程度正在下降。美国森林的毁灭性地减少，结果已使土壤恶化到这种地步，致美国大块地区有变为贫瘠荒土之虞。在这种情况下，资产阶级的歌颂者想证明资本主义制度优越的企图是多么可悲呵！让资本家们试一试，看他们能否象苏联现正进行的那样，实现改造自然的计划！？即使只是小部分的也好。这个伟大的计划，将在最短期间完全实现于社会主义的国度中。列宁——斯大林党和苏联政府所发动的战胜旱灾的攻势，将团结并领导千百万土地耕作者，进行争取年年丰收和全部征服自然力的斗争。几世纪来笼罩在草原与森林草原地带的旱灾威胁的年代将一去不复返了。最近还遭受热风侵害的农田，将在任何气候条件下繁茂起来，并将年年丰收。我们的子孙将永远感激列宁——斯大林党这个改造自然的英明决定。他们将永不会忘记：我们这一代已经进入了单纯对自然的斗争，而且创造了增加生产、建设共产主义的条件。”
