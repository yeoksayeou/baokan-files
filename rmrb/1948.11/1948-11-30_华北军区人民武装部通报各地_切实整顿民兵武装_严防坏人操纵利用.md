North China Military Region People's Armed Forces Department Issues Notice to All Areas
    Conscientiously Rectify Militia Armaments, Strictly Prevent Bad Elements from Manipulating and Exploiting Them
    [Reported by this newspaper] After preliminary rectification, the quality of militia organizations in various parts of North China has greatly improved, and they have played a significant role in participating in the war and maintaining order in the rear. However, the phenomenon of impurity in militia organizations in individual areas is still very serious, leading to infiltration by special agents and conspirators, resulting in incidents of murder, communication with the enemy, and betrayal. At the beginning of this month, the People's Armed Forces Department of the North China Military Region specifically issued a notice to all areas, calling for increased vigilance. During the organizational rectification this winter, special attention should be paid to the purity of the members' quality, the militia discipline should be conscientiously rectified, the weapons should be strictly checked and controlled, and the militia organization should be strengthened.
    In Beidu Village, Linzhang, Jinnan, six militiamen controlled by special agents (including deputy leader Ma Ju), together with more than 20 armed special agents, surrounded the district cadre residence in the village on the night of October 9, and shot and killed our district cadres Comrades Deng Hongxian and Hao Zhihui, and wounded district cadre Wan Rong and militiaman Shang Mazhu. Ma Ju and the other six people then fled with the armed special agents, taking away nine rifles and pistols and 190 rounds of ammunition.
    On the seventh of last month, Li Shanji, a militiaman from Dongwang Village, Xinle, Jizhong, was framed by special agents and killed by a landmine. Zhang Wuqun, Zhang Sigou (soldiers who deserted with weapons), and Cui Gu and other three militiamen from Sucunzhuang in the county, posing as our field army soldiers, asked the Chenzhuang village for carts to transport supplies. The village cadres believed them and sent Jia Xiubao with a mule cart. Not far out of the village, Zhang and others shot and killed Jia, and robbed the cart and livestock. Mo Xiaoxi, a militia squad leader from Caocun in the county, and Wang Heishuan, a militiaman, carried rifles and hand grenades and stole 528 catties of eight telegraph wires, selling them for 724,500 Jibi yuan.
    Some of the above-mentioned cases have been solved, and the perpetrators have been sent to the government for legal action. The fugitives are still being captured. In order to eradicate and prevent such incidents, the Military Region Armed Forces Department has issued a notice calling on all areas to be vigilant and conscientiously rectify the militia.

　　华北军区人民武装部通报各地
    切实整顿民兵武装　严防坏人操纵利用
    【本报讯】华北各地民兵组织经过初步整顿后，质量大为提高，在参战、维持后方秩序等方面起了巨大的作用。但个别地区民兵组织不纯的现象更严重存在，致被特务、阴谋分子潜入，发生杀人、通敌、叛变事件，华北军区人民武装部特于本月初通报各地，号召提高警惕，在今冬整顿组织中特别注意队员质量纯洁，切实整顿民兵纪律，严格清查与掌握武器，健全民兵组织。
    冀南临漳北杜村被特务掌握的民兵六人（内有副队长马驹），配合武装特务二十余人，于十月九日夜包围该村的区干部驻地，枪杀我区干部邓洪现、郝志会两同志，击伤区干部万荣与民兵尚马住。马驹等六人即与武装特务一起逃去，拐走长短枪九支，子弹一百九十粒。
    冀中新乐东王庄民兵李山记于上月七日被特务架出，以地雷炸死。该县苏仙庄民兵张五群、张四狗（携械潜逃战士）及崔古等三人，冒充我野战军战士，到陈庄要大车送路，村干部信以为真，即派贾秀保以骡车送行。出村不远，张等即将贾某击毙，将车畜劫去。该县曹村民兵小队长默小喜与民兵王黑拴，携带步枪、手榴弹，偷割八次电线达五二八斤，售冀钞七二四五○○元。
    上述事件，有的已经破案，凶犯解送政府法办。潜逃者正继续抓捕。为根绝与预防此种事件，军区武装部特发出通报，号召各地警惕，切实整顿民兵。
