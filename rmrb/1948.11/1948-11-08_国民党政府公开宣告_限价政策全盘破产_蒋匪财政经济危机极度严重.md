Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th – The Kuomintang government has publicly declared its price control policy a complete failure. The puppet Executive Yuan passed “Supplementary Measures” to the “Emergency Financial and Economic Decree” on October 31st, announcing that price controls would be lifted from November 1st. “Grain will be traded at market prices and freely transported and sold.” After the abolition of price controls on yarn, cloth, sugar, coal, and salt, a system of "negotiated pricing" will be adopted, with the Kuomintang government's "central control agencies verifying the pricing to coordinate and regulate." "Other important goods, including daily necessities and industrial raw materials, will be managed by local governments with reference to supply conditions, according to the principle of verified pricing."

After implementing currency reform on August 19th, the Kuomintang government attempted to use violence to maintain the credit of the bogus Gold Yuan, freezing prices at the August 19th level. Over the past two months, large numbers of police, military police, and secret agents have been dispatched to inspect shops, factories, warehouses, and residences, arresting merchants and extorting them through terror. The result has been rampant price increases, capital flight, and market paralysis in major cities under Kuomintang rule, with black markets flourishing. Factories have been forced to suspend or reduce production due to insufficient profits and inability to purchase raw materials, leading to worker unemployment. By early October, a buying panic swept through major cities, shops closed, and food shortages became severe. Workers and teachers in public education could not survive, leading to strikes, school boycotts, and class boycotts against hunger, plunging the Kuomintang-controlled areas into chaos. This price control policy, implemented by the Kuomintang government "after the most careful consideration and with the greatest determination" (according to puppet Finance Minister Wang Yun-wu), had to be declared a complete failure after only seventy-three days.

After the Kuomintang government abolished price controls, the first reaction was a surge in prices everywhere. An Associated Press report from Shanghai stated: "On the evening of the 2nd, the prices of daily necessities had soared by 500 to 800 percent compared to the frozen prices." According to an Agence France-Presse report on the 1st, in Shanghai "grain prices doubled within a few hours." A Central News Agency dispatch also revealed that grain, yarn, cloth, and groceries had all risen in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hangzhou, and newspapers were also increasing prices significantly. With the bogus Gold Yuan continuing to inflate, coupled with the oppression of tax increases and price increases for public utilities and transportation stipulated in the "Supplementary Measures" passed by the Kuomintang Executive Yuan, further dramatic price increases in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are inevitable. Just as using violent "price controls" to salvage its imminent economic crisis was futile, the so-called "assessed pricing" and "negotiated pricing" methods are also doomed to failure. Even puppet legislators believed that "prices will become even more uncontrollable after the abolition of price controls" (according to a Central News Agency dispatch on October 26th), and adjusting prices is "like jumping from hot water into cold water, which is a sure way to accelerate death" (according to a United Press dispatch on October 28th). At the beginning of the Kuomintang government's "currency reform," we pointed out that the "currency reform" was a great deception, a great plunder, and a great inflation. The current developments prove that the deception has been completely exposed, and the result of the intensified inflation and plunder is an extremely severe financial and economic crisis. The Kuomintang reactionary government is now reaping the bitter fruit of its own actions.

### 国民党政府公开宣告  限价政策全盘破产　蒋匪财政经济危机极度严重

　　国民党政府公开宣告
    限价政策全盘破产
  　蒋匪财政经济危机极度严重
    【新华社陕北五日电】国民党政府已公开宣告其限价政策全盘失败。伪行政院于十月三十一日通过“财经紧急处分令”的“补充办法”，宣布从十一月一日起取消限价，“粮食依照市价交易自由运销”，纱、布、糖、煤、盐取消限价后，改取“议价”，由国民党政府“中央管制机关核本定价统筹调节”，“其他重要物品包括民生日用品及工业原料，授权地方政府参酌供应情形，依核本定价之原则加以管理。”
    国民党政府于八月十九日实行币改后，曾妄图使用暴力维持伪金圆券的信用，将物价冻结在八月十九日的水平上。过去两个多月来，出动大批警察、宪兵、特务，使用恐怖手段到处检查商店、工厂、仓库、民宅，大批逮捕商人，进行敲榨掠夺；而其结果是造成了国民党统治区各大城市的物价狂涨，物资逃避，市场瘫痪，黑市流行，工厂因不敷成本及买不到原料而停工减产，工人失业，至十月初抢购风潮更弥漫各大城市，商店关门，粮荒严重，工人及公教人员活不下去，反饥饿的罢工、罢教、罢课四起，国民党统治区陷于一片混乱。国民党政府此一“经最深切之考虑，以最大之决心”（伪财长王云五语）实施的限价政策，前后仅七十三天，就不得不宣告全盘破产。
    国民党政府取消限价后，第一个反应就是各地物价纷纷上涨。美联社上海消息称：二日晚日用必需品价格已较冻结价格狂涨百分之五百至八百。据法新社一日报导，上海“粮价在数小时之内即上涨一倍”。中央社电亦透露：上海、天津、青岛、杭州粮食、纱布、杂货均告上涨，报纸也在大量增价。在伪金圆券继续膨胀的情形下，再加上国民党行政院这次所通过的“补充办法”中所规定的加税及公用、交通事业加价等掠夺措施的压迫，今后国民党统治区物价更剧烈的上涨是无可避免的。正如想用暴力“限价”来挽救其迫在眉睫的经济危机无济于事一样，所谓“评价”、“议价”等一套手法，其失败也是注定了的。甚至伪立委也认为“取消限价后物价益发不可收拾”（据中央社十月二十六日电），调整物价“等于从热水跳到冷水里，这是一定要加速死亡的办法”（据合众社十月二十八日电）。国民党政府“改革币制”之初，我们曾指出“币改”乃是大骗局、大掠夺和大膨胀，现在的发展证明骗局已完全揭穿，膨胀与掠夺变本加厉的结果，造成其财政与经济危机的极度严重，国民党反动政府正自食其恶果。
