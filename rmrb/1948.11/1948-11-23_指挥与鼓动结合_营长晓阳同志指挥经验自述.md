　　Combining Command and Motivation
  　Battalion Commander Comrade Xiaoyang's Self-Description of Command Experience
    “The attack on the enemy at Yu's Compound began, with both sides firing fiercely. At first, our machine guns were firing from below the ridge. In the past, I would have cursed: ‘Damn it, who are you shooting at!’ This time, I said: ‘Be brave! Climb up, use your firepower to suppress the enemy and cover the infantry's advance!’ So the machine guns all moved up, with two machine guns moving forward more than ten meters. As a result, the firepower became even more intense.
    The enemy fired flares one after another, lighting up the ground brightly. Our firearms were hesitant to fire. According to the old habits, I would have cursed again. This time, I said: ‘The enemy's flares are pointing out targets! Quickly find the enemy's position and aim at them!’ This reduced the soldiers' fear and also clearly observed the positions of the enemy's three or four machine guns. We then fired fiercely, and the firepower became more intense and accurate. The small cannons and 60mm mortars all hit the courtyards in the front of the enemy's position. Then I said: ‘The artillery is hitting well! Aim and keep firing!’ Everyone was motivated and fired at the same time.
    Why did we seize the enemy's front line in twelve or thirteen minutes and even break into the courtyard in this battle? Because we suppressed the enemy's firepower with two bursts of fierce firing. The enemy infantry in the courtyard were driven away by the small cannons and 60mm mortars (as seen by Zhao Wencai of the Fifth Squad who entered the village). During the attack, we only had one wounded soldier.
    The Second Platoon was moving very slowly, which was frustrating. The Third Platoon, acting as a reserve, was lying prone near me. Originally, according to the old habits, I would have cursed: ‘Damn it, advance! If you don't advance, you'll be shot!’ This would have increased the soldiers' resentment towards the commander. This time, I shouted: ‘Can you gain military merit by lying there? Those who want to gain military merit, come forward!’ Zhao Liancai, a soldier in the Ninth Squad, replied: ‘Okay! We'll fight wherever the leader points!’ I immediately replied: ‘Good! You go this way towards the blockhouse, using the three-three system of leapfrogging forward, covering each other!’ The three-three formation was immediately deployed. At this time, the small cannons and machine guns provided cover on their right flank. They advanced more than a hundred meters and fought all the way to the enemy's bunker without any casualties.
    ‘The Ninth Squad has already gone up, aren't we going to charge?’
    ‘Charge! Kill!’ The First Platoon was also motivated by the Ninth Squad to go up.
    When we got to the front of the blockhouse, everyone was at a loss. I shouted loudly: ‘One group climb up and throw grenades!’
    After that, the enemy's artillery fired over, and I said again: ‘It's too crowded, comrades, spread out a little.’
    ‘Combining command and motivation’ is the call of the regiment's political department. As a commander, I certainly respond to the call of my superiors. However, I haven't done enough in this regard and need to work harder. Here are a few experiences:
    (1) Soldiers and officers strongly oppose simple curses like ‘I'll shoot you!’ ‘I'll kill your head!’ as they increase resentment and are a manifestation of warlordism. Combining motivation with command can inspire fighting courage and is more effective than simple orders and coercion. This kind of courage will be more normal and resolute.
    (2) The more you scold and reprimand on the battlefield, the more confused the commanded become. This is old experience. Using motivation is no less effective than scolding and reprimanding. Due to the soldiers' political awareness, no one wants to lag behind.
    (3) The slogans put forward by the political cadres should be based on the needs of the command at the time. That is to say, motivation should be combined with command. To achieve this, one must have tactical vision, and not just shout empty slogans like ‘Gain merit!’ That is empty and powerless. Being敏捷敏捷 agile and closely combining motivation with command will inevitably effectively execute orders, complete tasks, reduce casualties, and maintain high morale. This experience is worthy of attention from commanders. ………”

　　指挥与鼓动结合
  　营长晓阳同志指挥经验自述
    “向于家大院敌人的攻击开始了，双方猛烈的射着。开始，我们的机关枪在岭坎下射击，按过去脾气，就要骂一声：‘妈的×，你打个鬼呀！’这次我却说：‘勇敢点！爬过去，用火力压住敌人，掩护步兵前进！’于是机关枪都往上移动位置了，有两挺机枪向前移动十多公尺。这样一来，火力就更猛了。
    敌人照明弹一个跟着一个打，大地照得雪亮，我们的火器不大敢打了，要按过去老习惯，又会骂人的，这次却说：‘敌人照明弹指目标了，快找敌人位置对准他打！’这样就减少了战士的恐惧心理，又观察清楚了敌三、四挺机枪的位置，再猛打，火力就猛而且准了。小炮，六○炮，都打到敌人阵地前沿的院落里，于是，我就说：‘炮打得好呀！对准！再打他！’大家都同时受了鼓动，同时打响了。
    这次战斗，为什么十二、三分钟就夺取了敌人的前沿，并还打进院子呢？因为猛打两次，压住了敌人的火力，院子里敌人步兵被小炮、六○炮揍跑了（打进村子里的五班赵文才看见的），而进攻中我方却只有一个负伤的。
    二排突的很慢，急坏人了，作预备队的三排在我附近伏着。本来，老习惯要骂：‘妈的×，前进！不进枪毙你’！这样会增加战士对指挥员的成见。这次我就喊：‘你们趴在那里能立战功吗？立战功的到前边去！’九班战士赵连才接着说：‘好吧！首长指哪里我们就打哪里！’我随即答道：‘好！你们走这里向炮楼前进，用三三制各个跃进，互相掩护！’三三制队形立即展开了，这时小炮、机枪在他们右侧加以掩护，通过百多米地，一直打到敌碉堡跟前，一个也没有伤亡。
    ‘九班都上去了，我们还不冲吗？’
    ‘冲啊！杀呀！’一排又被九班鼓动上去了。
    打到炮楼跟前，大家无法了，我高声的喊：‘一个组爬上去打手榴弹！’
    以后，敌人炮打过来了，我又说：‘太挤了，同志们散开一些。’
    ‘指挥与鼓动结合’，这是团政治处的号召，我是指挥员，当然响应上级的号召，不过这一点作的还不够，还要努力，这里，有这几点经验：
    （一）　单纯‘枪毙你！’‘杀你的脑袋！’战士和干部对这样的谩骂很反对，是会增加成见的，是一种军阀习气的表现。鼓动与指挥结合，会启发战斗勇气，比单纯命令、强迫要有效得多，这种勇气会更正常坚决。
    （二）　战场上越训、越骂，被指挥的就越糊涂，这是老的经验。用鼓动的方法，比训、骂的作用不会小的。由于战士们的政治素养，谁也不愿落后的。
    （三）　政工干部鼓动口号的提出，要根据当时指挥上的需要。就是说鼓动要与指挥结合，要做到这样，就要有战术眼光，而不要只是空喊：‘立功啊！’那是空洞无力的。而机敏的使鼓动与指挥密切结合，则必然有效的执行了命令，完成了任务，伤亡常小，士气常高。这一经验是值得指挥员们注意的。……………”
