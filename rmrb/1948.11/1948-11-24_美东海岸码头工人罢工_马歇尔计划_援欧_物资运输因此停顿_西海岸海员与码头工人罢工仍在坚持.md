Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Reports from various sources: 65,000 dockworkers on the US East Coast have been on strike, starting on the 9th, demanding wage increases. By the 13th, the strike had spread to all ports along the 700-mile coastline from Portland, Maine, to Hampton, Virginia, including New York, the largest port in the United States, as well as Boston, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. American Atlantic shipping and Pacific shipping have both been paralyzed as a result, and the transport of Marshall Plan "aid to Europe" materials has also been halted. According to Agence France-Presse, citing the head of the Economic Cooperation Administration in Washington, this new strike has dealt a major blow to the American shipping industry and may cause dangerous chaos throughout the American economy. The East Coast strike was launched by the International Longshoremen's Association of the American Federation of Labor. Workers voted against accepting the employers' offer of a 15-cent per hour wage increase, demanding 50 cents instead. Furthermore, the strike of 30,000 seamen and dockworkers on the US West Coast, which began on September 2, is still ongoing. According to incomplete surveys, over 400 ships have been halted due to the East and West Coast strikes.

Another report: The strike of 16,000 oil workers in California, USA, ended on the 4th after 62 days. The new work resumption contract stipulates a wage increase of 12.5 cents per hour.

　　美东海岸码头工人罢工
  　马歇尔计划“援欧”物资运输因此停顿 
    西海岸海员与码头工人罢工仍在坚持
    【新华社陕北十八日电】各方报导：美国东海岸六万五千码头工人，自九日起先后为要求增加工资而举行罢工。至十三日止，罢工已延及自缅因州的波特兰至弗吉尼亚州的汉普顿七百哩海岸线上的各个港口，包括美国最大港口纽约与波士顿、巴尔的摩尔、费城在内。美国大西洋航业货运和太平洋航业货运一样，已因此同归于瘫痪，马歇尔计划“援欧”物资的运输，亦已因此停顿。据法新社引华盛顿经合总署负责人称：这一新罢工已给美国航运业一个重大的打击，可能引起整个美国经济危险的混乱。此次东海岸罢工系由劳联国际码头工人联合会发动，工人在罢工前投票反对接受资方所提每小时增加工资一角五分的合同，而要求增加五角。又息：另一由九月二日开始的美国西海岸三万海员与码头工人的罢工，迄今仍在坚持中。据不完全调查，因东西海岸罢工而停顿的船只，已达四百艘以上。
    另息：美国加利福尼亚州一万六千石油工人的罢工，在坚持六十二天之后，已于四日结束。复工新合同规定每小时增加工资一角二分半。
