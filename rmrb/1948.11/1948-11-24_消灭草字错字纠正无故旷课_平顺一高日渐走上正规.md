　　Eliminating Sloppy Writing and Correcting Misspelled Words; Rectifying Unexcused Absences
  　Ping Shun No. 1 High School Gradually Gets on the Right Track
    [Taihang News] Since Ping Shun No. 1 High School began its rectification on August 1st, it has gradually gotten on the right track and achieved the following results. First of all, there has been progress in writing. The students of No. 1 High School used to write in a scribbled hand, with even more misspellings. In order to improve their cultural level, the school first decided to start by eliminating scribbled writing and correcting misspellings. To this end, they put forward the slogan "Not writing sloppily is being a good student"; and wrote slogans in the classrooms of each grade such as "Writing fewer misspelled words and not writing misspelled words is truly working hard". A teaching plan was drawn up, deciding to eliminate scribbled writing and correct 40% of misspellings this semester. The specific method was to not correct the sloppy and misspelled words when students were copying large and small scripts, but to use marks to represent sloppy or misspelled words, letting the students correct them themselves. In addition, they were announced in the school's weekly newspaper to be praised or criticized. As a result, a wave of dictionary checking was aroused among the students, and at the same time, it promoted students to study together. Thanks to the efforts of the students, in the first week, Zhang Ping'an of the sixth grade had 49 sloppy characters, 20 misspelled characters, and 12 wrongly used characters; in the second week, there were only 20 sloppy characters, 19 misspelled characters, and four wrongly used characters; in the third week, there were even fewer, only eight sloppy characters, 16 misspelled characters, and five wrongly used characters. Everyone else has made progress. By the end of the semester (end of September), statistics showed that misspelled words had been reduced by more than 70%, and wrongly used characters in the sixth grade had also been reduced by 49%. After the school forwarded these achievements of the students to their parents, the parents were all happy. Liu Wenqi's parents said: "Correcting sloppy writing and misspelled words is very good. Even if they should recognize a hundred characters but only recognize eighty, what they write will still look like characters." In addition, life is also becoming more regular. The school stipulates that lifestyle is one of the semester's test scores, and students evaluate and determine the scores based on each person's usual lifestyle performance. It was also announced that no leave would be allowed without special circumstances, and five points would be deducted from the lifestyle score for each day of leave or overstaying leave. Therefore, since September, there have been far fewer cases of overstaying leave.
    The relationship between the student union and the school administration has also been clearly divided, so that the school committee truly plays a leading role in promoting learning and completing various plans.
    The experience of the school's getting on the right track and achieving results is: There must be a key focus of work every week, and it should be carried out for several weeks in a row when necessary. In particular, a breakthrough should be made at one point to promote the general. The school has made great achievements in eliminating sloppy writing and misspelled words because it has grasped an important link (i.e., the most common thing), promptly issued calls, and promptly made summaries; detailed statistics are made at any time, and if there are too many who fail to achieve it, the good ones are praised and the call continues; if there are too many who achieve it, the bad ones are criticized and preparations are made to end. By doing this bit by bit, achievements can be obtained. (Xu Qian, Liu Chen, Zhang Decai, Yue Xintian, Wang Jianchang)

　　消灭草字错字纠正无故旷课
  　平顺一高日渐走上正规
    【太行讯】平顺一高自八月一日开始整顿以来，日渐走向正规，并获得以下成绩。首先在写字上已有进步。一高学生原来都是一笔潦草字，错别字更多。为了提高文化，学校首先决定从消灭潦草字，纠正错别字入手。为此，便提出“不写潦草字才是好学生”的口号；并在各年级教室内写了“少写错别字不写错别字才算真用功”的标语。订教学计划，决定本学期肃清潦草字，纠正错别字百分之四十。具体作法是改学生写的大小仿时，对草字和错别字不改，而用记号代表是草字或错别字，让学生们自己去改。另外在该校星期报上进行公布，加以表扬或批评。这样以来，便激起了学生查字典热潮来，同时也促起学生们互相研究开了。由于学生们的努力，第一周六年级张平安草字四十九个，错字廿个，别字十二个；第二周则只有草字廿个，错字十九个，别字四个；第三周就更少只有草字八个，错字十六个，别字五个。其他每个人都有进步。到了学期末（九月底）的统计，错字减少了百分之七十以上，六年级的别字也减少了百分之四十九。学生这些成绩，经学校转送给各家长后，各家长们也都高兴。刘文岐的家长说：“改正草字错字很好，那怕该识一百个字只识上八十个，写出来也象个字样。”另外在生活上也正规起来。学校规定生活分为学期测验分数之一，由学生按每人平素生活表现评议定分。并宣布没特殊事情不准请假，请假及越假一天扣生活分五分。因此自九月份起，越假的就大大的少了。
    学生会与学校行政的关系也有明确的分工，使学委会真正起了推动学习完成各种计划的领导组织。
    该校走向正规获得成绩的经验是：每周必须有重点的进行一种工作，必要时应连续几周的进行。特别是应突破一点，推动一般的去做。该校在消灭草字错字上能做出很大的成绩，就是抓住了重要的一环（即最普遍的东西），及时提出号召、及时做出总结；随时详密的统计起来，做不到的多了，就表扬好的，继续号召；做到的多了就批评坏的，准备结束。这样一点一滴的做起，就能获得成绩。（许谦、刘臣、张德才、岳心田、王建昌）
