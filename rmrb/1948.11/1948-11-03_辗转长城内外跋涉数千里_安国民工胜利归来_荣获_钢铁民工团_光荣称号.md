[Ji Zhong Electric] The An Guo labor stretcher team, following the army on a long expedition, departed in the first month of the lunar year and, after eight months, traveled thousands of miles inside and outside the Great Wall, climbing mountains and crossing rivers, victoriously completing their mission and returning in glory in late September. Not a single laborer deserted during this expedition, and 98% of the streamlined three companies performed meritorious service. In carrying out their tasks, they lived and fought alongside the army, demonstrating the heroic spirit of the people. A certain unit of the field army awarded them the honorary title of "Iron Labor Corps." Upon their return, they were also presented with four silk banners, one machine gun, two pistols, and one hundred rifles. Photographs of the laborers' deeds and social gatherings were taken and will be exhibited in various places as a memorial.

	Overcoming Numerous Difficulties, Completing Arduous Tasks
In their activities at the front, they overcame all difficulties to complete their tasks: for example, during the support of the Nankou Campaign, the passage through which the stretchers were carried was blocked by intense enemy infantry and aircraft fire, and the planes bombed repeatedly, dropping a total of 36 bombs. They calmly responded and finally completed the task without any casualties. Supporting the Gubeikou Campaign, the enemy also heavily blockaded the passage for stretchers to descend the line of fire, using flares and aircraft at night for surveillance. When the wounded could not be transported down, they opened up a road on the barren mountainside nearby. When moving, the mountain was steep and the road narrow, and the stretchers, which normally required four people, could not fit, so they were changed to be carried by two people. When they reached the top and could no longer carry the stretchers, they put them down and carried the wounded on their backs, grabbing onto rocks with one hand and jujube branches with the other, with the people behind pushing those in front. They pushed each other forward in a continuous chain, persisting until the battle ended the next day, and not a single wounded person was left on the front line. In the process of carrying out their tasks, their political awareness was further enhanced. When the corps was streamlined from seven to four companies in the summer, the vast majority were willing to stay. For example, Li Guilin, Deng Laoquan, and others, because they were older and weaker, were encouraged by their leaders to return home, but they firmly refused and stayed. In Chahar Province, Yu Laokui and two others lost contact with the main force due to an accident. Anxiously, they searched day and night for eight days and seven nights, finally finding their unit. During long marches, they took great care of the wounded, often helping the soldiers carry ammunition, sometimes carrying up to 54 pounds. While passing through the fifty-li-high mountain "Little Western Heaven" on the Rehe road, it was raining, and the mountain road was rugged and slippery. When some soldiers fell behind, the laborers took them in, some were carried on stretchers. For one sick soldier, laborer Wang Dagui warmed his own hands and warmed the soldier's chest. When transporting wounded soldiers down the line of fire, laborer Zhao Xiaobei wiped the blood for the wounded eight times. Laborer Wang Dagui saw the wound of a wounded soldier bleeding and took off his own jacket and wrapped it around the wound. They also used their saved vegetable money of 1,020,000 yuan to comfort the wounded. When living in the same village as the army, they let the army settle in first, and then settled in themselves, fully demonstrating revolutionary love.

	Helping the Masses with Production, Rescuing People in Disaster Areas
In Xiaoshiguang and Shugou Village, in the "no-man's land" created by Chiang Kai-shek in Rehe, they witnessed the poverty of the people, who lacked clothing and food, and immediately launched a thrift campaign, saving four liang of rice per person per day and providing relief. They also freely formed three visit-the-bitter groups to visit the poor and provide relief to many. In addition to saving rice, they also donated 49 pieces of clothing, 132 jin of old cotton (quilts), 50,000 yuan of border currency, 66 jin of coarse grains, 18 jin of wheat, and 8,142 jin of firewood. In addition, they seized the opportunity to help the people with production, and when tasks came, they immediately went to support. According to statistics for six months and thirteen days: in the 56 villages they stayed in, they helped 2,542 households of people to do 7,552 full workdays, working on 68 kinds of jobs. Company Commander Wang Wenpu, after marching at night, led the whole company to do odd jobs such as fetching water, sweeping the yard, and cleaning out the pen the next morning. Communist Party member Cui Chunshan in Qidi Village, Laishui County, voluntarily went to the fields of poor households to work and carry manure. He also started a wave of land reclamation in the village, turning the vacant land on the mountainsides, roadsides, and threshing grounds into cultivated land. When stationed in Beidong, it was the summer harvest and weeding season, and the farmers were too busy to rest, so they helped the people harvest the summer crops and weed the fields, solving the problem of labor shortage during the busy farming season, which was welcomed by the masses.

    辗转长城内外跋涉数千里
    安国民工胜利归来
    荣获“钢铁民工团”光荣称号
    【冀中电】安国民工担架团随军远征，自正月出发，历时八个月，辗转长城内外，爬山过河，跋涉数千里，胜利完成任务，于九月下旬光荣归来。此次远征民工，无一逃亡，而且精简后的三个连百分之九十八立下功劳。在执行任务中，他们与军队共同生活、共同战斗，表现了人民的英勇气概。野战军某部赠他们以“钢铁民工团”的光荣称号。归来时，又赠予锦旗四面、机枪一挺、手枪二支、步枪一百支。并摄制民工事迹及联欢照片，在各地展览以作纪念。
            克服重重困难  完成艰巨任务
    他们在前方活动，克服一切困难完成任务：如在支援南口战役中，抬上来的担架所经的道口，被敌步兵与飞机密集的火力封锁住，飞机反复轰炸，计投弹三十六次，他们沉着应战，终于完成任务，无一伤亡。支援古北口战役，在担架下火线的道口，敌火力封锁也很严密，夜间并以照明弹配合飞机监视，伤员运不下去，他们就在一旁的荒山上开辟了道路。行动时山陡路窄，四人抬的担架容纳不下，即改为两人抬。走至顶头，无法再抬，即放下坦架背着伤员往上爬，一手扒着石块，一手揪着枣枝，后边的就推着前边的，这样一个推一个，一连串的推着前进，如此坚持到第二天战斗结束，第一线上未扔下一个伤员。在执行任务当中，政治觉悟更为提高，在夏季该团由七个连精简为四个连时，绝大多数都愿留队。如李贵林、邓老权等，因年岁较大力气弱，领导上动员他回去，他坚决不肯又留了队。在察南时，于老奎等三人，因故与大队失掉联系，急的他昼夜不息连找了八天七宿，终于找到队上。在长途行军中，对伤员爱护备至，往往帮助战士背负弹药，有时一人负重达五十四斤。在热南路过五十里高山“小西天”时，下着雨，山路崎岖光滑，战士们有的掉队，民工们即收容着，有的用担架抬着走。对一个有病战士，民工王大贵烤热了自己的手，去暖烘战士的胸部。在火线上运下伤员时，民工赵小贝给伤员擦血八次。民工王大贵见伤员创口流血，脱下自己的袄，给伤员裹上创口。他们并将自己节余的菜金一百零二万元，慰问了伤员，与军队住一个村时，先让军队住下，然后自己再住，充分表现了革命的友爱。
            帮助群众生产  援救灾区难胞
    在热河蒋造“无人区”小石光、树沟村时，他们目睹贫民无衣无食的情况，即开展了节约运动，每人日余米四两、施行赈济。并自由结合了三个访苦组，进行访苦，赈济了不少贫民。除节米外，还赈衣服四十九件，老棉花（套子）一百卅二斤，边币五万元，杂粮六十六斤，麦子十八斤，拾柴八千一百四十二斤，此外，他们还抓紧空隙助民生产，任务来了他们马上又去支援。据六个月零十三天的统计：驻过的五十六个村，帮助二千五百四十二户群众作了七千五百五十二个整工，作活有六十八种。连长王文朴，夜间行了军，次晨即带起全连做挑水、扫院、出圈等零活。党员崔春山在涞水棋地村，自动到贫户地里去做活、挑粪，在该村并带起开荒热潮，把山坡、道旁、场边的空荒地，都掘成了熟地，在北东驻防时，正值夏收锄苗，农民忙不得歇，他们即助民收夏锄地，解决了当地农忙人少的困难，得到群众欢迎。
