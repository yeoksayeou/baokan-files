A Certain Field Hospital of Our Army in Jinzhong
  Displaying a High Degree of Revolutionary Enthusiasm
  Overcome Numerous Difficulties and Complete the Task
[This newspaper's report] In the battle to liberate Jinzhong, the staff of the Sixth Hospital demonstrated and developed a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm. When the campaign began, they were still on their way to the front line after being transferred. When they received an order midway to rush to the front line overnight, they executed the order without discounting the fatigue of marching for more than twenty days. They rushed to a certain place on the front line after two days and two nights of marching. It was already dark, but they could not find any food (the rural areas of Jinzhong had long been looted by Yan Xishan's bandits). So everyone endured hunger and fatigue and rested.

In the middle of the night, the superior came with an order to receive ×× number of wounded soldiers tomorrow. So everyone immediately divided the work and took action to prepare: the administrative staff went out to find food, buy chickens and other food and daily necessities, the cooks prepared the stove, the cadres looked at the houses, and the head nurses led the nurses to clean the wards and make the beds. Before the receiving task was completed, the superior asked them to transfer all the wounded to the rear overnight and transfer to another place to receive the task. So they transferred the wounded within an hour and arrived at the new destination. After rushing to the destination, there were too few houses to accommodate them. They transferred four villages in a row, but it was the same everywhere. Until they transferred to a large village, the houses had not yet been fully inspected, but the wounded had already arrived one after another. Therefore, they first let the wounded live in the houses that had been inspected, and first cooked food for the wounded in the staff's stove, preparing while receiving them. Thus, the intense work began. Many nurses changed dressings during the day and took night shifts to receive the wounded. When they were hungry, they ate one or two cold steamed buns and considered it a meal. The fourteen-year-old nurse Feng Donghe almost fainted while changing dressings—they all forgot their fatigue and dissolved in a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm.

When the materials they brought were used up, but they could not receive any more immediately, the nurses automatically took out their quilts to solve the crisis of bandages; and actively tried to overcome numerous difficulties.

The people who changed dressings went out early and returned late, without a free day, and the nursing staff was even more so. Even a very small nursing staff had to lead one or two civilians to nurse the wounded in a hospital. Five or six comrades became ill due to busy work. Even so, no one complained, and even people who usually complained did not complain at this time.

Such busyness, insufficient staff, and inadequate care did not reduce their treatment results. After two and a half months, they calculated that the recovery rate for discharged patients reached more than 95%. In the treatment of tetanus, a disease that was most troublesome and feared by general hospitals and surgeons in the past, eight out of the twelve wounded who developed it in the Sixth Hospital were cured, except for one fulminant case and one who died due to lack of serum treatment. The reason why they were able to do this was because they were able to detect it early, isolate it quickly, assign special personnel for nursing and treatment, and inject large amounts of tetanus antitoxin serum, sodium thiosulfate, carbolic acid, and other liquids, thus saving the wounded from the brink of death.

　　晋中我军某野战医院
    发挥了高度革命积极性
  　突破重重困难完成任务
    【本报讯】在解放晋中的战役中，某医院六所工作人员表现与发扬了高度的革命积极性。当战役开始时，他们还行进在奉调赴前线的路上，当中途接到上级要他们连夜赶到的命令时，他们就毫不顾二十余天来的行军疲劳，不折扣地执行了命令：经两天两夜的急行军赶到了前线某地，天已大黑可是连一点粮食也弄不到（晋中农村早被阎匪抢掠一空了），于是大家忍着饿带着疲倦而休息了。
    半夜里上级就来命令，要明天接收××个伤员，于是大家马上便分工出动，进行各项准备：事务人员外出弄粮食买鸡子及其他食用、常用品，炊事员盘火，干部看房子，看护长领导着看护员们打扫病房整理床铺。收容任务还未满，上级又叫他们将所有伤员连夜转送后方，转移到另外地方去接收任务，于是他们在一小时内转出伤员而到达新的目的地，赶到了后房子少无法收容，按连转移了四个村皆如此。直到又转移到一个大村时，房子还未看完，伤员已经陆续的来了，因此首先就把先看的房子让伤员住进去，并先在工作人员灶上给伤员弄饭吃，就这样一面准备一面收容。于是紧张工作开始了，许多看护员同志白天换药，晚上则连游夜班带收容伤员。他们饿时吃一两个冷馍便算了。十四岁的小看护员冯东河在换药中几乎晕了过去——他们都忘记了疲劳，溶化在高度的革命热情里。
    把带来的材料用完了，但是马上又领不到，因此看护员同志们都便自动地拿出被单来，解决了绷带的危机；并积极想办法克服重重困难。
    换药的人早出晚归，一天也不闲，而护理员则尤然，即是一个很小的护理员也得带领一两个民夫来护理一个病院的伤员，五六个同志都因工作繁忙而致病了。虽然如此，并没一个出怨言的，甚而平常讲怪话的人此时也不讲了。
    这样的忙碌，人员不足，照顾不周，但是并没有使他们的治疗成绩因此而减，两个半月后他们计算了一下：治愈出院的达百分之九十五以上。在破伤风的治疗上，这是过去为一般医院及外科家最感苦恼与恐惧的病，但是在六所所发生的十二个伤员中，除一个爆发性的及一个因无血清治疗而死亡的外，治愈了八个。他们所以能如此是因为他们能够及早发现、迅速隔离，派专人护理和治疗，大量注射破伤风治疗血清、硫苦、石炭酸等液，因此伤员得从死亡线上被挽救过来。
