From the evening of the 7th to the 10th, it successively liberated the towns and stations of Tancheng, Matou, Donghai, Guanyun, Lianyungang, Xinpu, Xin'anzhen, Wayao, Pao Che, Yunhe Station, Zhu'erwo, Daxujia, Zaozhuang, Yixian, Pixian, Guanhu, Jiakou, Tanshang, Lincheng, Hanzhuang, Taierzhuang, Jiawang, Liguo Station, Liuquan Town, Yutai, Fengxian, Yucheng, Dangshan, and Huangkou, and controlled over 400 li of the Xuzhou-Haizhou section of the Longhai Railway and over 200 li of the Huangkou-Shangqiu section. Nearly 20,000 fleeing enemy soldiers were killed or captured, and efforts successfully brought about the glorious uprising of Feng Ye'an's three divisions, one regiment, and one battalion. As of the time of dispatch, one PLA unit had captured Maocun Town and Jingshanpu northeast of Xuzhou, less than 30 li from Xuzhou. Another PLA unit has surrounded five armies of the Huang Botao Corps and other units fleeing west from Haizhou and Xin'anzhen in the area between Xiuwan and Nianzhuang to Caobaji and is currently fiercely encircling and annihilating them.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 12th: The People's Liberation Army has successively recovered important strongholds in the famous coal mining areas northeast of Xuzhou, such as Zaozhuang, Jiawang, Yixian, Taierzhuang, Liguo Station, and Liuquan, and captured Maocun Town on the Jinpu Railway, more than 20 li north of Xuzhou. The main force is pressing directly on Xuzhou. The People's Liberation Army first occupied Zaozhuang and Yixian on the evening of the 6th, and the defending enemy fled south in panic. On the 8th and 9th, all of the old Northwest Army's 59th Army (under the jurisdiction of the 38th Division and the 180th Division) and the 132nd Division of the 77th Army and the 111th Regiment of the 37th Division, a total of three divisions and one regiment, revolted on the front line. The People's Liberation Army immediately occupied the above-mentioned areas. On the night of the 9th, the People's Liberation Army also captured Maocun Town north of Xuzhou, controlled the Yinhe Railway Bridge, and is crossing the Yinhe and Bulao Rivers and advancing towards Xuzhou.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 12th: The People's Liberation Army, which is encircling and annihilating the enemy's 7th Corps east of Xuzhou, completely annihilated the 44th Division of the 100th Army of the corps in the Caobaji area on the afternoon of the 10th, and completely annihilated the 8th Regiment of the 3rd Division of the enemy's 9th Army in Dagengzhuang on the same day. The enemy's 7th Corps is surrounded in the Bayiji to Nianzhuang area, 80 li east of Xuzhou, and traffic between Xuzhou and Nianzhuang has been completely cut off.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 12th: The People's Liberation Army captured Lianyungang, an important military port on the coast east of Haizhou, on the 9th, annihilating a part of the defending enemy (salt police), more than 400 people. The bandits fled in boats in a panic by sea.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 12th: The two armies of Feng Zhi'an's forces who revolted in Xuzhou on the 8th of this month were led by Generals Zhang Kexia and He Jili, deputy commanders of the enemy's Third Pacification Zone. The units participating in the uprising that have been identified are the entire 59th Army (38th Division and 180th Division), the entire 132nd Division of the 77th Army, and the 111th Regiment and one battalion of the 109th Regiment of the 37th Division. The 59th Army and the 77th Army were originally old Northwest Army units under Song Zheyuan. After the "July 7th" Incident in 1937, Song first led the troops to participate in the War of Resistance Against Japan, but because they were not direct descendants of the Chiang gang, they were severely discriminated against, with few reinforcements of soldiers and weapons, and were often placed in dangerous positions. In the Central Plains War of 1940, Chiang ordered Zhang Zizhong, the original commander-in-chief of the unit, to lead only one regiment to cross the Han River to fight, and he died in battle as a result. After the Japanese surrendered, Chiang drove them to serve as cannon fodder in the civil war and suffered multiple blows from our forces. One of the divisions was originally responsible for the defense of Xuzhou. After the Jinan Campaign, Chiang became wary of all miscellaneous troops and completely drove the unit to the Yunhe River along the line north of Xuzhou. After our army in Shandong went south, the officers and soldiers of the unit were determined to revolt.

　　淮海解放战争进展迅速
  　北路大军直迫徐州
  　东路歼敌一师一团
    攻占重要军港连云港
    【新华社淮海前线十二日电】淮海战役发动后，华东人民解放军进展甚速。自七日至十日晚已相继解放郯城、马头、东海、灌云、连云港、新浦、新安镇、瓦窑、炮车、运河站、猪儿窝、大许家、枣庄、峄县、邳县、官湖、加口、滩上、临城、韩庄、台儿庄、贾汪、利国驿、柳泉镇、鱼台、丰县、虞城、砀山、黄口等城镇及车站，控制陇海路徐（州）海（州）段四百余里，黄（口）商（邱）段二百余里。歼俘逃敌近两万人，并争取冯冶安部三个师及一个团一个营光荣起义。截至发电时止，一路解放军已克徐州东北之茅村镇及荆山铺，距徐州不及三十里。另一部解放军已将自海州及新安镇地区西逃之黄伯韬兵团等部五个军分别包围于秀湾及碾庄至曹八集间地区，现正猛烈围歼中。
    【新华社淮海前线十二日电】解放军接连收复徐州东北之著名煤矿区枣庄、贾汪、峄县、台儿庄、利国驿、柳泉等重要据点，并攻占徐州以北二十余里津浦铁路上的茅村镇。大军直迫徐州。解放军于六日晚首先进占枣庄、驿县，守敌仓惶向南逃窜。八、九两日，利国驿、柳泉、台儿庄等地的国民党旧西北军五十九军全部（辖三十八师、一八零师）及七十七军之一三二师与该军三十七师之一一一团共三个师及一个团在前线起义。解放军当即占领上述各地。九日夜，解放军又攻占徐州以北的茅村镇，控制引河铁桥，并正横渡引河、不老河，向徐州推进中。
    【新华社淮海前线十二日电】在徐州以东围歼敌第七兵团的解放军，已于十日下午在曹八集地区将该兵团一百军之四十四师全部消灭，并于同日在大耿庄歼灭敌第九军第三师第八团全部。敌第七兵团系被包围于徐州以东八十里之八义集至碾庄地区，现徐州至碾庄之间的交通已完全切断。
    【新华社淮海前线十二日电】解放军于九日攻占海州以东滨海之重要军港连云港，歼灭守敌（盐警）一部四百余名，歼匪乘船由海上狼狈逃窜。
    【新华社淮海前线十二日电】本月八日在徐州起义的冯治安部两个军，系由敌第三绥区副司令张克侠、何基礼两将军所率领。参加起义的番号据已查明者为五十九军（三十八师及一八零师）全部，七十七军之一三二师全部及三十七师之一一一团、一零九团一个营。五十九军及七十七军原为西北军宋哲元旧部。一九三七年“七、七”事变后，宋首率该部参加抗日战争，但因非蒋贼嫡系，甚受歧视，兵员武器均少补充，并常被置于危险地位。一九四零年中原之战，蒋贼令原该部总司令张自忠仅率兵一团渡汉水作战，因而战死。日寇投降后，蒋又驱其充当内战炮灰，曾先后遭我多次打击。该部原有一个师担任徐州城防。济南战役后，蒋贼对一切杂牌部队均存戒心，乃将该部完全驱至徐州以北运河沿线。山东我军南下后，该部官兵乃决心起义。
