[Jizhong Electric] Since Botou City rectified its industrial and commercial policies and corrected errors that infringed upon industry and commerce, industry and commerce have experienced significant development. From January to August, 187 new industrial and commercial businesses were added. Among them, established merchants (with fixed storefronts) increased from 579 to 650, factories increased from 7 to 13, and workshops increased from 546 to 650. Mobile merchants decreased by 17, and peddlers decreased by 11 (this is a normal phenomenon of industrial and commercial prosperity). Influenced by our industrial and commercial policies, industrial and commercial businesses in the Kuomintang-controlled areas have returned to operate. According to statistics at the end of August, 104 people have returned from Tianjin and other places, including 29 managers, most of whom are now employed. In terms of industry, state-owned enterprises have basically embarked on the path of enterprise management. All factories have begun to implement the spirit of the North China Industrial and Commercial Conference and overcome leftist phenomena in the labor movement. The disorganization and lack of discipline existing in state-owned factories have been initially corrected. Egalitarianism in wages has been initially overcome. Workers have begun to establish a new attitude towards labor. Some factories have also launched production competitions. After a certain match factory launched a production competition, it overcame the difficulties of not being able to produce for two seasons, and the output increased by a quarter. The electric light company supplied 1,700 lamps in early April, and increased to 2,400 lamps by the end of July. Private industrial enterprises have also generally developed. The eight oil pressing businesses added a diesel engine, increasing daily output from 467 jin to 660 jin. Yimin Oil Mill uses a diesel engine to drive the machine for oil pressing during the day, and a thunder roller to drive it at night, but still cannot keep up with sales. Wenxingzhi Iron Factory used to melt one furnace every three days, melting 2,000 jin of iron per furnace; now it melts one furnace every two days, melting 2,500 jin to 3,000 jin of iron per furnace. Four paper mills added eight new pools. Caustic soda, Tiger Balm, Rendan, etc. have all been successfully manufactured and are of good quality. In order to take care of the development of industry and commerce, the city decided that industrial and commercial businesses can pay with rice instead of labor service during wartime, and abolished the excessively high wage system of 1946, allowing both parties to freely negotiate, as long as workers and apprentices are not mistreated, the government will not interfere. As a result, private industrial enterprises added 56 new businesses from April to July, adding 363 new employees, workers, and managers. In terms of commerce, merchants have broken the idea of ​​"sitting and waiting" and relying on cities occupied by Chiang Kai-shek. Many people have begun to run to Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, and Zhoucun and Weixian in Shandong. For example, Yushengdong transports Gaoyang cloth for sale, and recently transported silk from Zhoucun, Shandong, and has become the most developed cloth business in Botou City. Bamboo goods businesses have gone to Xingtai to transport raw materials. The city's economic ties with inland cities are also becoming increasingly close, and merchants from distant cities have come to the city to purchase goods. Remittances from inland towns to banks totaled 499 million yuan in four months.
    The city's bank issued loans totaling 1.91 billion yuan from April to July. The installation of caustic soda, Tiger Balm, and glass slabs was all supported by loans. Among the 56 bamboo goods businesses, 43 received loans. During the industrial "slack season," product sales were difficult, capital was tied up and could not be turned over, so the bank implemented three methods: buying finished products, lending for orders, and collateral lending, to solve the difficulty of selling finished products for industrial businesses. The city's market transactions are also increasing: in half a year, 22.33 million jin of edible salt and 12,663 head of livestock were traded. In the transportation industry, before the rainy season, thousands of carts entered and exited the city every day. There were originally 22 ships, but because the government takes care of foreign ships in many ways, there are now 331 ships frequently traveling to and from Botou. A certain match factory increased its external workers by 20, driving about 670 housewives to paste boxes. More than 320 porter workers had little to carry this spring, but now they all have work. Each person can earn 1,000 to 4,000 yuan per day. Mud workers and tilers used to have almost no work to do, but now because there are many repairs to houses, they can earn 3,000 yuan per day in addition to food.
    Currently, the urgent problems to be solved in the city are: first, some industrial and commercial owners unreasonably restrict workers and shop assistants from attending meetings, and some delay workers' wages. These problems have not been resolved in a timely and appropriate manner. Second, in the development of industry, there are still subjective and blind phenomena in leadership: for example, when brick kilns started work, the sales channels were not found in advance, and as a result, 1.56 million bricks were fired, leaving more than 1.1 million unsold. This phenomenon must be overcome urgently.

　　泊头市正确执行工商政策
  　工厂作坊均有增加
    【冀中电】泊头市自端正工商政策，纠正侵犯工商业的错误后，工商业获得很大发展。从一月到八月，新增工商户一百八十七家。其中座商（有固定铺面），由五百七十九户发展到六百五十户，工厂由七家发展到十三家，作坊由五百四十六户发展到六百五十户。行商减少十七户，摊贩减少十一户（这是工商业繁荣的正常现象）。在我工商业政策影响下，国民党统治区工商业户纷纷返回经营，据八月底统计，自天津等地回来一百零四人，其中有经理二十九名，现已大部就业。在工业方面：公营企业基本上走上了企业化道路，各厂开始贯彻了华北工商会议的精神，克服了工运中的左倾现象；对公营工厂中存在的无组织无纪律状态，进行了初步纠正；初步克服了工资上的平均主义；工人开始树立了新的劳动态度，有的工厂并展开了生产竞赛。某火柴厂展开生产竞赛后，战胜了两季不能生产的困难，产量增加四分之一。电灯公司四月初供一千七百盏灯，七月底增至二千四百盏。在民营工业方面，一般的也得到发展。榨油业八家增加了柴油机一个，由日产四百六十七斤增至六百六十斤。益民油房白天用柴油机带动机器榨油，晚上用雷滚子带动，还供不上卖。文兴之铁厂过去每三天化一火，每火化铁二千斤；现在每两天化一火，每火化铁二千五百斤至三千斤。四家纸厂新增了八个池子。火碱、老虎油、仁丹等都已制造成功，且质量很好。该市为照顾工商业的发展，决定工商业户出战勤时可以出米顶勤，并废除了一九四六年过高的工资制度，由双方自由协议，只要不虐待工人学徒，政府即不加干涉。这样一来，民营工业从四月至七月即新增五十六户，增新职员、工人、经理等三百六十三人。商业方面商人打破了“座等”与依赖蒋占城市的思想，不少人开始跑邯郸、邢台、石家庄及山东的周村、潍县等城市。如裕盛东运高阳布出售，最近并到山东周村运来绸子，已成泊市布业中最发达的一家。竹货业纷纷到邢台去运原料。该市和内地城市经济联系也日益密切，远地商人纷纷到该市购货。从内地城镇汇到银行的款，四个月共达四万万九千九百万元。
    该市银行从四月至七月共发放贷款十九亿一千万元。火碱、老虎油、玻璃石板的装造，都是贷款扶植起来的。竹货业五十六户中，贷款的即有四十三户。在工业“背月”中，产品推销困难，压着资本不能周转，银行又实行了收买成货，借款订货和抵押放款三种办法，解决了工业户成品推销困难。该市市场交易亦日益增加：半年中仅食盐即成交二千二百三十三万斤，牲口成交一万二千六百六十三头。运输事业上，雨季前全市每天有千辆大车出入。船只原有二十二只，因政府对外来船只从多方照顾，现经常来往泊头的船只达三百三十一只。某火柴厂增加外工二十人，带动糊盒的家庭妇女约六百七十人。三百二十多个脚行工人，今春没什么脚扛，现在都有了活。每人每天可挣一千至四千元。泥工瓦匠以前几乎没什么活作，现在因修理房子的很多，每天除吃可挣三千元。
    目前该市急待继续解决的问题，一是有的工商业主无理限制工人、店员参加会议，有的拖延工人工资，这些问题尚未及时适当解决。二是在发展工业中，领导上还有主观盲目现象：如砖窑开工，未预先找好销路，结果烧出砖一百五十六万块，剩下一百一十多万块卖不出去，此种现象急须克服。
