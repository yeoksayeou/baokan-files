Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Telegram: Thanks to the concerted efforts of the Party, government, military, and people throughout the region, we have overcome severe natural disasters and Chiang Kai-shek's bestial sabotage, and strived to achieve an average of 60% harvest this autumn. According to statistics from the Administrative Office's Finance Department, the region has a total of 31,577,625 mu of cultivated land. Excluding 33,880 qing of flooded land and 4,100 qing of wasteland that yielded no harvest, there are still 27,778,375 mu. Averaged over all cultivated land, the yield is about 80 jin of coarse grain per mu, totaling approximately 220 million jin of coarse grain. The main crops, millet, sorghum, and corn, generally yielded about 100 to 130 jin per mu in most areas of Hebei Province. In the seventh and eastern parts of the second districts of Henan Province, sorghum yielded over 200 jin, but millet, beans, etc., were severely flooded, resulting in minimal harvest. The fifth district had the worst harvest, with general yields of millet and sorghum ranging from 40 to 60 jin. Last year, except for the fourth district and some flooded areas with only 40% to 50% yields, the general yield was 80%. Although this year's harvest is lower compared to last year, achieving such results given the severe difficulties is indeed remarkable. What difficulties did we overcome in production to achieve this 60% harvest? First, we overcame Chiang Kai-shek's bestial sabotage before his demise. In the first half of the year, the enemy attempted to destroy our positions on the south bank of the Yellow River, north of the Longhai Railway. In this narrow area, they concentrated twenty brigades, repeatedly conducting "encirclement and suppression" and "mopping-up" operations, engaging in burning, killing, and looting ten times more cruelly than the Japanese invaders. According to incomplete statistics, over 38,000 people were conscripted, over 16,000 head of livestock were seized, 1,764 carts were stolen, over 170 million jin of grain were looted, and over 32,000 houses were burned down, with many villages completely destroyed. Our local armed forces and militia stubbornly defended their positions, fought the enemy, and resolutely protected farmers engaged in rushing to cultivate, plant, and weed. Local armed forces also utilized lulls in combat to assist farmers with labor and production, with some militiamen even taking their weapons to the fields. In particular, our military district's armed forces and the armed forces of the third district, during the spring plowing season, engaged in intense and continuous battles, constantly and proactively attacking the enemy, causing the enemy in the areas of Shan County, Chengwu, and Ju'nan to be beaten everywhere and unable to disperse. In May, we also destroyed the enemy's main stronghold of Changgou on the Grand Canal line, making the enemy uneasy. By early August, during the wheat harvest and summer planting season, our military district's armed forces annihilated over 1,800 enemy troops in a single blow in Junan, successively recovering the county towns of Juancheng, Dingtao, and Chengwu, and launching a full-scale offensive in coordination with the main forces, allowing farmers to plant with peace of mind, which was of great significance for this year's autumn harvest.
    Chiang Kai-shek's bandits also sabotaged dikes everywhere, making this year's floods extremely difficult to rescue. What's worse, the enemy repeatedly sabotaged the Yellow River dike repair and flood control projects and dug open the fourth Daokou gate of the Wei River, creating the Junxian-Huaxian flood disaster area. The destruction of crops was extremely significant, and even the mobilization of civilian labor resulted in great losses. During the flood rescue at Gaocun, right in the midst of the busy farming season, enemy sabotage forced the mobilization of over 300,000 civilian laborers and over 210,000 head of livestock, greatly impacting agricultural production. However, our military and civilians throughout the region, amidst unprecedentedly intense and brutal battles, pushed forward with this year's agricultural production and finally overcame the enemy's destructive and poisonous plots. Second, we overcame the severe drought. It wasn't until after July 20th that various localities received thorough rain, and in many places, autumn seedlings had already died from the drought. Although our leading cadres at all levels devoted themselves to promoting watering and replanting, the lack of concrete leadership prevented the formation of a widespread movement. Generally, planting was done very late, which is a major reason for the reduced harvest. However, under the overnight arrangements of our leading organs at all levels, especially the organizational leadership of district and village cadres and rural branches, temporary mutual aid was mobilized, and various rear-area organizations and troops assisted in planting, enabling all villages to complete replanting within two to five days after the rain. This is an important reason why we were able to achieve an average of 60% harvest after the reduction. In the restored areas south of the Yellow River, such as Dongming, we also vigorously led the reclamation of wasteland, advocating that whoever plants reaps, providing planting loans, and many cadres personally went to the fields to inspect and concretely study wasteland reclamation methods, which also expanded the sown area. Third, we overcame insect plagues. A total of eighty-one districts in twenty-eight counties throughout the region experienced insect plagues. The county and district governments immediately made this a temporary central task, and various rear-area organizations and schools also participated, jointly organizing the extermination with the masses. This prevented a major disaster and ensured that the autumn grain, which was almost within reach, did not suffer major losses. Fourth, our democratic government leading the masses in digging rivers and dredging waterways was also an important factor in increasing this year's autumn harvest. This year, the main rivers dredged included the Tuhai River, Majia River, and ten other main rivers north of the Yellow River, as well as thirteen tributaries and three hundred and sixty-seven ditches. The dredging of the Tuhai River alone allowed the drainage of accumulated water from 12,709 qing of land. The dredging of the Jin Line River in Fan County and Yanggu County prevented floods on thousands of qing of land. This is the result of flood prevention construction throughout the region since the beginning of spring.

　　战胜天灾及蒋匪破坏
  　冀鲁豫获得六成收
    【冀鲁豫电】在全区党政军民一致努力下，战胜了严重的天灾及蒋匪兽性的破坏，争取了今年秋收平均达到六成。据行署财政处统计，全区共有耕地三千一百五十七万七千六百二十五亩，除水淹地三万三千八百八十顷、荒地四千一百顷未收成外，还有二千七百七十七万八千三百七十五亩，按全部耕地平均，每亩收成粗粮八十斤左右，总计收获粗粮在二十二万万斤左右。主要农作物谷子、高粱、棒子，在河北地区大部均收一百至一百三十斤左右。河南地区之七分区及二分区东部，高粱收二百余斤，谷子、豆子等因被水淹，收获无几。五分区收成最坏，一般谷子、高粱均在四十斤至六十斤。去年除四分区和一部水淹区只有四、五成年景外，一般均为八成年景。今年收成与去年相比，虽然减收，但就今年的严重困难情况来说，能够得到如此成绩亦属不易。我们在生产中战胜了那些困难，而获得六成收的成绩呢？第一、战胜了蒋匪死亡前兽性地破坏。上半年，敌人企图毁灭我黄河南岸陇海路北之阵地，在这一狭小地区，曾集中了二十个旅，反复进行“清剿”“扫荡”，比日寇更残酷十倍的烧、杀、抢劫。据不完全统计，被抓壮丁三万八千余人、被抢牲畜一万六千余头、大车一千七百六十四辆、粮食一万万七千余斤、烧毁民房三万二千余间，有许多村庄被烧光。我地方武装与民兵，顽强的坚持阵地，对敌搏斗，坚决保护农民进行抢耕、抢种、抢锄。地方武装并利用战斗空隙帮助农民劳动生产，有的民兵则带枪下地。尤其我军区武装与三分区武装，在春耕阶段，以紧张的连续战斗，不断地主动进攻敌人，使单县、城武、巨南一带之敌到处挨打，不敢分散。五月间，我又打掉运河线上的敌人主要据点长沟，使敌人坐卧不安。至八月初，正值麦收夏种，我军区武装，于鄄南一举歼敌一千八百余人，相继收复鄄城、定陶、城武等县城，配合主力，展开全面攻势，使农民得到安心下种，对于今年秋收具有重大意义。
    蒋匪更到处破坏堤岸，致使今年水灾极难抢救。尤甚者，是敌人对于黄河修堤治险工程的反复破坏，并挖开卫河四道口门，制造了浚滑水灾区。其对于农作物的毁灭故重大，即动用民力一项，亦损失甚大。高村抢险，正当农忙期间，因敌人破坏不得不动用民工达三十余万，牲口二十一万多，极大的影响了农业生产。而我全区军民，在空前紧张而残酷的战斗中，推进了今年的农业生产，而终于战胜了敌人毁灭性的毒谋。第二、战胜了严重的旱灾。直到七月二十日以后，各地方降透雨，有不少地方，秋苗被旱死。我各级领导干部，虽曾致力于推动浇苗点种，但因具体领导不够，未能形成普遍运动。一般均下种甚晚，乃减收重要原因之一。但在我各级领导机关连夜布置下，特别是区村干部及农村支部的组织领导，动员临时互助，并有各后方机关部队助种，使所有村庄在雨后两天到五天内全部抢种完毕。这是在减收之后又能获得平均六成收的重要原因。黄河南之东明等恢复地区，更大力领导灭荒，提倡谁种谁收，进行贷种，不少干部亲自上地检查，具体研究灭荒办法，也扩大了播种面积。第三、战胜虫灾。全区有二十八县共八十一个区发生虫灾，县区即做为临时中心任务，各后方机学校亦均参加，与群众共同组织扑灭。未成大灾，保证了眼看就到嘴边的秋粮未受大的损失。第四、我民主政府领导群众挖河疏水，对于增加今年秋收也是重要因素，今年疏浚的主要河流，有徒骇河、马颊河等黄河以北十一条主要河流，以及其支流十三条，沟渠三百六十七条；河南则修治了汶沱，运河，大小青河及东平湖堤等。仅徒骇河的疏浚即可使一万二千七百零九顷地的积水泄出。范县、阳谷两县疏浚金线河，可使千顷地免致水灾。这是全区入春以来的防水建设成绩。
