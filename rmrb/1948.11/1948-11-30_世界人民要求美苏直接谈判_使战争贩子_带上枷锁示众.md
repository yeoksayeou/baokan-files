　　People of the World Demand Direct Negotiations Between the US and the Soviet Union
  　Making the Warmongers "Paraded in Shackles"
    Recently, the voices of the American people and the people of the world demanding democratic peace, and first of all demanding direct negotiations between the four countries to solve the Berlin issue, have become louder and louder. The National Committee of the American Progressive Party, at its second plenary session held from the 12th to the 14th, passed an important resolution, denouncing the reactionary domestic and foreign policies of the two American parties, calling for an end to aid to Chiang Kai-shek and other reactionary governments, demanding "reopening negotiations with the Soviet Union," and expressing "willingness to be crusaders dedicated to the cause of peace." Seventy-one prominent American scientists, writers, artists, and pastors also issued a statement calling for "rebuilding US-Soviet cooperation." Not long ago, Washington columnist Alsop wrote an article asserting that Truman would go to Europe to meet with Stalin before the opening of the new Congress. Just such an ordinary article sparked widespread desires for peace among the people of the United States and Western Europe. Even the President of the current United Nations General Assembly, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, and United Nations Secretary-General Lie, could not violate the will of the people of the world and sent letters to the four countries of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France on the 13th, respectively, requesting direct negotiations to resolve the Berlin issue, so as to open the way to the conclusion of peace treaties with Germany, Austria, and Japan. This proposal has been accepted by the Soviet government.
    This irresistible trend of the people of the whole world demanding international peace has made those warmongers who artificially create a war atmosphere by using the "Berlin issue" "paraded in shackles," showing an increasingly isolated and embarrassed appearance. On the 12th, Marshall hurriedly denied Alsop's inference, incoherently saying that this was a "Soviet peace propaganda offensive." On the 17th, the United States, Britain, and France publicly rejected the suggestions of Evatt and Lie. The third United Nations General Assembly, which has been in session for more than two months and is still in progress, under the manipulation of the US-British bloc, rejected the Soviet proposal to ban atomic weapons and disarmament, which represents the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world, on the 19th, and passed the "Belgian proposal stamped with the American golden seal." This series of facts has further exposed the reactionary factions of the United States, Britain, and other countries' fear of peace and the original form of their aggressive policies that undermine peace to the people and public opinion of the world.

### 世界人民要求美苏直接谈判　使战争贩子“带上枷锁示众”

　　世界人民要求美苏直接谈判
  　使战争贩子“带上枷锁示众”
    最近以来，美国和世界广大人民要求民主和平、首先是要求四国直接谈判以解决柏林问题的呼声，是越来越响亮了。美国进步党全国委员会于十二日至十四日举行的第二次全会，通过重要决议，痛斥美国两党反动的内外政策，呼吁停止对蒋介石与其他反动政府的援助，要求“与苏联重开谈判”，并表示“愿为献身于和平事业的十字军”。美国七十一位著名科学家、作家、艺术家和牧师，亦发表声明，要求“重建美苏合作”。不久以前，华盛顿专栏作家科芬曾著文断言杜鲁门在新国会开幕前将赴欧与斯大林会谈，仅仅这样一篇普通的文章，却掀起了美国与西欧人民广泛的和平渴望。甚至本届联合国大会主席澳外长伊瓦特与联合国秘书长莱氏，亦不能违反世界人民意志而于十三日分别致函苏美英法四国，要求举行直接谈判，解决柏林问题，借以打开缔结对德、奥、日和约的途径。这一提议已为苏联政府所接受。
    全世界人民要求国际和平的这一不可抗拒的潮流，使得那些利用“柏林问题”人工地制造战争气氛的战争贩子们，“带上枷锁示众”，表现了愈益孤立和狼狈的窘相。马歇尔于十二日慌张地否认科芬的推断，语无伦次地说什么这是“苏联的和平宣传攻势”。美英法三国于十七日又公开拒绝了伊瓦特和莱氏的建议。开会两个多月至今仍在进行中的第三届联合国大会，在美英集团的操纵下，于十九日否决了代表世界人民和平愿望的苏联禁止原子武器与裁军的建议，通过了“盖着美国金印的比利时提案”。这一连串事实，使美英等国反动派害怕和平的鬼胎与破坏和平的侵略政策的原形，更暴露于世界人民与舆论之前。
