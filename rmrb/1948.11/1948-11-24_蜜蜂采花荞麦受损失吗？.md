　　Every year when the buckwheat is in full bloom, people from Henan bring many honeybees to our district to release them for pollination. This year, over a hundred hives have been placed in both Shulu and Zhongshengban. After they were set up, the village cadres interfered, and the masses clamored, refusing to allow the bees to be released for fear of damaging the buckwheat. The beekeepers claimed that there would be no damage, but the masses didn't believe them. Then the beekeepers slaughtered a pig and treated all the cadres of Shulu Village, and as a result, they were allowed to release the bees. But when it came time to collect the honey, some people took basins and bowls to ask them for honey, and Zhongshengban asked the beekeepers to provide 500 jin of honey as compensation for the loss. This issue is difficult to resolve. Does buckwheat suffer losses from honeybee pollination? (Jianzhi, Fifth District of Zhengding)

　　Answer: Buckwheat flowers are a good source of nectar, so many beekeepers or professional beekeepers often move their bees to areas with more buckwheat during the buckwheat flowering season. If the number of bees and the acreage of buckwheat are appropriate (according to experienced beekeepers, one hive of bees for every three mu of buckwheat is the most suitable), it is harmless to the buckwheat, and the honey harvest is also plentiful. If there are too many bees and not enough flowers, many bees crawling back and forth on the flowers to suck up the nectar can easily break the delicate buckwheat flower pistils. Damage to the pistils makes it difficult for them to bear fruit.

　　Are there too many bees being released in your district's Shulu and Zhongshengban? Your letter does not specify, so please investigate. Even if there are too many, what is the extent of the damage to the buckwheat? Please also investigate and compare with other villages to see if the damage is as severe as claimed. The masses in these two villages demanding such high compensation from the beekeepers is probably inappropriate and will have a significant impact on the development of the beekeeping industry. In particular, it is wrong for village cadres to accept the beekeeper's pig feast, and they should be criticized. If, after investigation and comparison, it is confirmed that there has been significant loss, then the beekeeper may be asked to provide appropriate compensation. Beekeepers should also be advised to appropriately adjust the number of bees based on the nectar sources in their own beekeeping area or to seek ways to maintain the nectar sources. If it is necessary to transfer the bees, they must first consult with the village of destination, appropriately dispersing the bees according to the amount of buckwheat, and avoid concentrating them in one place, which would damage the buckwheat and cause disputes with the buckwheat owners. This is also beneficial for the beekeepers, because ignoring the maintenance of the nectar source and excessively concentrating the bees will inevitably reduce honey production.

### 蜜蜂采花荞麦受损失吗？

专栏：询问与答复

　　蜜蜂采花荞麦受损失吗？编辑同志：
    每年荞麦正开花时，有河南里拉着很多蜜蜂，在我区住着放花。今年又住在树路和中圣板各一百多窝。住下后，村干部就干涉，群众也乱嚷嚷，不叫放，怕荞麦受损失。放蜂的就说不受损失，但群众不信。放蜜蜂的又杀猪请树路村全体干部，结果是让他放了。但摇蜜的时候，有些人拿着盆子碗子给他要蜜，中圣板要放蜂的拿五百斤蜜补偿损失。这问题很不好解决，荞麦是否受损失呢？（正定五区建之）
    答：荞麦花是很好的蜜源，所以养蜂较多或专业养蜂者，每到荞麦开花季节，常把蜂搬到荞麦多的地区放蜂，如果蜂数和荞麦亩数适度（据养蜂有经验人谈，三亩荞麦一窝蜂最适当），对荞麦无害，采蜜也多。如果蜜蜂特别多，而花少，很多蜜蜂来回地在花上爬动吸吮花蜜，荞麦花柱比较纤细，很容易折断，花柱一受损伤即难结实。
    在你区树路和中圣板放蜂是否过多呢？来信未说明，请你调查一下。即便过多的话，对荞麦损害的程度如何？亦请从别的村调查比较一下，是否损害那样严重呢？该二村群众要求放蜂者赔偿那样高，恐不恰当，对养蜂业的发展上影响很大。特别是村干部吃养蜂人杀猪之请是错误的，应该予以批评。如果经过调查比较，证实确有很大损失，则可酌情使养蜂人出适当补偿，并劝告养蜂人主要是根据自己养蜂地方的蜜源而适当调剂养蜂的数量或讲求维持蜜源的办法，如须转饲时，则必得先和转移目的村商量好，根据荞麦多寡而适当地分散，不要蜜集一处，以致损害荞麦而与荞麦主发生纠纷；这对于养蜂人也是有利的，因为不顾蜜源维持量而过度集中饲育，必致减少产蜜量。（农业部）
