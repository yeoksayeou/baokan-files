Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Reports from various sources indicate that the French working class, enraged by the French government's brutal suppression of veteran demonstrations, is launching a severe protest movement. Workers in Paris held a 24-hour general strike on the 13th to protest. To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the French Armistice of 1918, thousands of members of the French Veterans Association and the wartime underground resistance movement held a demonstration in Paris on the 11th. As the peaceful demonstration procession advanced along the Champs-Élysées towards the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, armed police, directed by Interior Minister and murderer Moch, were ordered to attack the demonstration, indiscriminately rushing and beating, and opening fire, wounding five demonstrators and arresting dozens, causing a serious act of brutality. Billoux, a member of parliament from the Allier province, a member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, and leader of the military committee of the National Council of Resistance during the Nazi occupation, was arrested after being beaten by the police and sent to the hospital. Another French Communist parliamentarian, Vaillant-Couturier, was also arrested, with the French government disregarding the parliamentary privilege of immunity from arrest.

After the act of brutality, the French working people and various progressive groups expressed great indignation and filed serious protests. Workers in various industries in Paris, under the call of the General Confederation of Labor, held a 24-hour general strike on the 13th. The general strike brought transportation in Paris to a virtual standstill, with power outages and newspapers ceasing publication (Associated Press). Industrial areas in the suburbs of Paris also held strikes. The General Confederation of Labor called on 20 million French workers to stand with the strikers in Paris to oppose the government's fascist methods. The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a statement denouncing the government for using fascist methods, employing terror and organized brutality against French workers. The statement called on all French workers, communists, socialists, Catholics, republicans, and all patriots to unite to protest the government's brutality, to protest the government's policy of preparing the ground for de Gaulle's rise to power and preparing for a new war.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: TASS and Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union report: Despite the government's implementation of police terror, arrests, threats, and killings, as well as the reactionary press's fierce attacks against them, the heroic strike struggle of French miners has entered its seventh week. Although in some mining areas, the police have forced some workers to return to work, the number of returnees is still negligible. Miners forced to return to work take every opportunity to slip out of the mines and rejoin the strike. In the past few days, the number of miners driven into the mines by the police has been decreasing, while the number returning to the ranks of the strikers, including members of "Workers' Force," has been increasing. After the French government's violent suppression of veteran demonstrations in Paris on the 11th was reported to the mining areas, the miners' strike movement has spread further, and many mining towns and workers' districts have also held demonstrations and rallies to protest the government's brutality.

The miners' heroic struggle continues to receive support from workers around the world. The National Union of Miners receives letters of support from workers around the world every day. A letter from the Moscow Basin Miners' Union of the Soviet Union stated, "We firmly believe that prisons and bullets, police persecution and provocations, cannot break your will to fight." A letter from the Donbass miners of the Soviet Union stated, "Let the friendship and solidarity of the working class be the source of your strength and courage." Donations from miners throughout the Soviet Union to French miners have reached 18.5 million francs. Czech and Polish groups have also donated large sums of money. Overall, on the 15th alone, the French Miners' Union received donations from various sources totaling more than 45 million francs.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: TASS Paris: The plenary session of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party opened on the 15th. Amidst loud applause, the meeting elected Member of Parliament Billoux as chairman, and the presidium included Thorez, Duclos, Marty, Mauvais, and Casan. The meeting first read a telegram of tribute to the miners, stating: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party extends fraternal greetings to the miners who have been on strike for more than six weeks demanding bread, and expresses condolences to the miners killed by the Socialist Minister of the Interior, Moch. The Central Committee assures the miners, who stand on the front lines of the struggle for the liberation of the motherland and the rebirth of France, that the French working class and all working masses are united with the miners in the ongoing and victorious struggle. The victory of the miners will be the victory of all working people and the entire French people over the cunning rulers. These rulers attempt to conquer and enslave the masses through starvation, in order to continue their policy of using American money to enslave France and prepare for a new war. After passing the above telegram, Member of Parliament Le Coeur reported on the international situation and the progress of the miners' strike.

　　抗议政府镇压退伍军人示威
    巴黎工人总罢工
  　各国工人捐款支援罢工矿工
    【新华社陕北十八日电】各方报导：为法国政府镇压退伍军人示威运动的暴行所激怒的法国工人阶级，正掀起一个严正的抗议运动。巴黎市工人于十三日曾举行二十四小时的抗议总罢工。为纪念法国一九一八年停战三十周年纪念，法国退伍军人协会及战时地下抵抗运动协会之会员数千人，于十一日在巴黎举行示威。当示威的和平行列沿香霭丽榭大街向无名英雄墓进发时，由内政部长杀人犯摩许指挥之武装警察，即奉令袭击示威行列，乱冲乱打，并开枪射击，弹伤示威者五人，又捕去数十人，造成严重暴行事件。阿利尔省国会议员、法共中央委员、纳粹占领时期抵抗运动全国会议军事委员会领袖比尔·维伦，在被警察殴伤送医院后被捕。另一法共议员瓦狄克·豪勒，也遭法政府蔑视议员不受逮捕特权被捕。
    暴行事件发生后，法国劳动人民及各进步团体表示极大的愤慨，并纷纷提出严重抗议。巴黎各业工人在总工会号召下，于十三日举行二十四小时总罢工。总罢工使巴黎运输实际上陷于停顿，电力中断，报纸停版（合众社）。巴黎市郊工业区亦举行罢工。总工会号召法国二千万劳动人民与巴黎的罢工者共同反对政府的法西斯手段。法共政治局发表宣言，斥责政府使用法西斯手段，以恐怖和有组织的暴行对付法国工人。宣言号召法国一切工人、共产党员、社会党人、天主教徒、共和派人士及一切爱国分子团结起来，抗议政府的暴行，抗议政府为戴高乐上台准备基础和准备新战争的反对政策。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社与电通社报导：不顾政府施行警察恐怖、逮捕、威胁和屠杀，以及反动派报纸对他们的激烈攻击，法国矿工的英勇罢工斗争已进入第七周。尽管在有些矿区，警察曾迫使一些工人复工，但复工人数仍是微不足道的。被迫复工的矿工们，只要一有机会就溜出矿坑重新参加罢工。过去数日中，被警察赶入矿坑的矿工人数已愈来愈的，而回到罢工队伍来少人包括“工人力量”的会员在内则愈来愈多。法政府十一日在巴黎对退伍军人示威采用暴力镇压事件传到矿区后，矿工罢工运动已更加蔓延，许多矿工城镇及工人区还举行了示威和集会，以抗议政府的暴行。
    矿工们的英勇斗争继续获得各国工人的声援。全国矿工工会每日都收到各国劳动者的声援信。苏联莫斯科盆地矿工工会的函件称，“我们坚信：牢监与枪弹、警察迫害与挑衅，都打破不了你们的斗争意志。”苏联顿巴斯矿工的函件称：“让工人阶级的友爱和团结成为你们的力量与勇气的泉源。”苏联各地矿工们寄给法国矿工的捐款已达一千八百五十万法郎。捷克、波兰各团体亦已捐出大量款项。整个地说，在十五日一日中，法国矿工工会即收到各方捐款达四千五百余万法郎。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：法共中央全会于十五日开幕。会议在响亮的鼓掌声中选出国会议员比尔。维伦为主席，主席团中包括多列士、杜克洛、马尔梯、摩维、加善。会议首先宣读向矿工们致敬的电文称：法国共产党中央委员会向要求面包已罢工六周余的矿工们致兄弟的敬礼，向被社会党内政部长摩许所杀害的矿工们敬表哀悼。中央委员会向站在为祖国解放和法兰西再生战斗第一线的矿工们保证，法国工人阶级及一切劳动群众与矿工们在正在进行并将得到胜利的斗争中团结一致。矿工们的胜利，将是全体劳动人民和全法人民对诡诈的统治者的胜利。这些统治者企图用饥饿手段以征服人民群众并奴役他们，以便继续其使用美国金钱奴役法国并准备新战争的政策。会议在通过上项电文以后，随即由国会议员勒古尔报告国际形势及矿工罢工进行情况。
