Xinhua News Agency, East China, 14th. To welcome the victory of the Huaihai Campaign, the people of Shandong, shortly after the liberation of Jinan, have launched another intense and enthusiastic campaign to support the front. The second group of 6,000 civilian laborers from the Donghai and Beihai districts of Jiaodong set off for the front a few days ago. In Yidong County, over 20,000 people, including 1,130 regular stretchers, more than 3,000 carts, ten militia platoons, and temporary civilian laborers, have also departed. In many villages, the number of people volunteering as civilian laborers to support the front has exceeded the original quota by several times. In Kouzi Village, Wenquan District, Dongqi (Xia) County, the original quota was four laborers, but over twenty people volunteered. Civilian laborers in the cart transport teams of Ju (County) and Yi (Shui) counties are in high spirits. Single-person carts commonly carry over 300 jin, and some even carry 450 to 600 jin. Over three million jin of grain has been transported to the front in twenty days. In Ye (County) South County, 20,000 women have already completed the second batch of 100,000 sets of quilted military clothing for the front and are now rushing to complete the third batch of 50,000 sets. Women in Huimin County, Bohai, have finished quilting 60,000 sets of military clothing amidst the autumn harvest. One million pairs of military shoes are being rushed into production in the entire Central and Southern Shandong region. Twenty-one small flour mills in Boshan City are processing flour day and night to supply the front, averaging 500 bags (45 jin per bag) of flour per day. In Fei County, over 15,000 organized women, in addition to directly participating in agricultural work in place of men supporting the front, have also been grinding 500,000 jin of flour at night. Women in Yiyuan County (new county, north of Yishui), in addition to husking rice, transporting grain, and making military clothing and shoes, are also actively participating in village administration, replacing the original cadres to lead civilian laborers in supporting the front. In Huangzhuang District alone, forty-three women are serving as village chiefs, deputy village chiefs, and neighborhood leaders.
