Simultaneously, it recovered Xiuwu and Daiwang Town to its west, and Muluan Village (new city of Wuzhi) to its south. This marks another victory for the Henan People's Liberation Army after completely annihilating the 115th Regiment of the 39th Division, totaling over 1,500 men. On the 25th, just as the Liberation Army was annihilating the 115th Regiment of the 39th Division at Xiaosiwu Village southwest of Huojia, over 5,000 enemy troops, including the first and second supplementary regiments of the bandit 40th Army, the direct units of the bandit joint defense headquarters of Xiuwu, Bo'ai, Huojia, and Wuzhi counties, an artillery battalion, and the Henan Security Regiment which fled east from Jiaozuo, led by Zhang Zhishan, the commander of the bandit four-county joint defense, moved out of Xiuwu to reinforce southward. On the 26th, the Liberation Army completely surrounded the bandits in the Yanmen area south of Xiuwu city. After several hours of fierce fighting, except for 500 men from the Wuzhi Self-Defense Force who escaped, the rest were compressed into Xunfeng Village, southeast of Xiuwu city. By the 27th, all the enemies were completely annihilated and captured. Detailed battle results are being verified. Prior to this, our troops south of Xinxiang, on the 22nd and 23rd, successively captured Kangcunyi, Zhongyi, ZhanDian, the north station of the Yellow River, and other enemy strongholds near Xiaoji Town and other places along the Pinghan Railway from Xinxiang to Zhengzhou, killing, wounding, and capturing over 240 enemy troops. Currently, our troops south of Xinxiang have completely controlled about 150 li of the Pinghan Railway from Balipu south of Xinxiang city to Zhengzhou, including the Pinghan Railway's Yellow River iron bridge. To the west of Xinxiang, the entire western section of the Daocheng Road west of Xiuwu is under our control, including the famous mining area of Jiaozuo. Currently, the enemies in northern Henan only remain in isolated strongholds such as Xinxiang and Huojia to its west, Huixian to the northwest, Jixian to the northeast, and Yangwu and Yuanwu to the southeast. Another isolated stronghold is Anyang city on the Pinghan Railway northeast of Xinxiang.
