　　Protect Grain
  　Strengthen Border Entry and Exit Management, Crush Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Gang's Grain-Grab Conspiracy
    [Xinhua News Agency, North China, 12th] According to news from Beiping: The Kuomintang bandit gang, in order to prolong its dying fate, has recently been plotting to plunder 10 million shi of wheat from the North China Liberated Areas under the guise of "requisition." The Chiang Kai-shek-Fu Zuoyi bandit gang has now organized the so-called "Hebei-Ping-Tianjin People's Food Purchase and Storage Association" in Beiping, allocating 40 million fake Gold Yuan notes as a fund for grabbing grain. The "Purchase and Storage Association" has set up several groups to go out and purchase grain separately, and forcibly compels grain merchants to purchase grain in the suburbs and various counties. The enemy in Baoding has recently transported a large amount of counterfeit currency, which is estimated to be used to grab grain in the city and suburbs. The Kuomintang is also looting grain by importing cloth and coal into our area in Pingjin and Mentougou, respectively. At present, the borders of the liberated areas of North China are vigilant against the enemy bandits' conspiracy, strengthening exit management, and protecting the people's food.

  　加强边境出入管理  粉碎蒋匪抢购阴谋
    【新华社华北十二日电】据北平消息：国民党匪帮为苟延其垂死命运，近以“征购”名义，阴谋在华北解放区内抢掠小麦千万石。蒋傅匪帮现已于北平组织所谓“冀平津民食购储会”，拨伪金圆券四千万元，作为抢粮基金。“购储会”下设若干小组，分头出动抢购，并强制粮商到郊外及各县购粮。保定敌人新近运到大批伪钞，估计可能在城郊抢购粮食。国民党更在平津及门头沟分别以布匹及煤炭输入我区方式掠取粮食。现华北解放区各地边境已警惕敌匪阴谋，加强出境管理，保护民食。
