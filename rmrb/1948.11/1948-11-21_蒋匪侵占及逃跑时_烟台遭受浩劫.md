Xinhua News Agency, Yantai, 12th: The devastation suffered by the famous commercial port of Yantai during the invasion and retreat of the Kuomintang bandit gang was unexpected. During the year or so of enemy occupation, many factory owners were forced to flee or died, and most of the production came to a standstill. The city's iron industry suffered a loss of more than 30 lathes under the enemy's "borrowing." Of the 91 iron factories during the democratic government period, only 14 remained after a year of enemy trampling. The number of textile factories also decreased from 156 to 21. The larger-scale "Ruifeng" flour company was granted a loan of 3 million North Sea currency by the democratic government before the enemy occupied Yantai last year, and production developed. After the enemy's occupation, it never started work due to lack of raw materials and power. It was also forced to requisition military grain or extort 280,000 catties of grain under the pretext of "economic crimes," which exhausted the company's capital. Before the enemy fled Yantai this time, they also robbed the company of the remaining 20-odd bags of rice and hundreds of flour bags. The nationally famous Zhangyu Winery's 700 mu of grape trees used for winemaking were cut down a lot by enemy soldiers, and the iron wire fence was also dismantled to repair fortifications. Zhang Jianhui, the supervisor of the company, was detained by the enemy for a year, and his right leg has been tortured to the point where he cannot move. Seven workers from Deshunxing Clock Factory were seized by enemy soldiers to serve as soldiers, and manager Ma Deren died of worry and illness. Tongsheng Tobacco Company was forced to pay more than 6,000 catties of tax grain to the enemy every month, and 52 boxes of cigarettes and 42 tons of coal were robbed. The manager of the factory, Wang Yushan, was forced to flee. Before the enemy fled, they were especially crazy about grabbing people and robbing them. Two large trucks from Dongji Automobile Company were robbed. In addition to the damage and dismantling of some of the electric company's machines, the enemy cut off the seven carbon gold bars of the remaining three generators when they fled, and all the important parts were robbed. The dredging boat, steamship, and sampans on the pier of the Haiba Engineering Association were either pulled away or destroyed, and none were spared. About 10,000 strong men were captured on the pier. Most of the city's more than 2,000 middle school students were forcibly taken away. Of the city's 145 electrical workers, 138 were captured. Many family members of the captured men cried out for their husbands and sons on the dock, and the enemy soldiers opened fire to suppress them. Some women committed suicide by throwing themselves into the sea. After this catastrophe, the citizens hated the Kuomintang bandit gang. After the liberation, the citizens regained light and warmth. The democratic government is actively trying to restore the city's electricity, telephone, customs and other facilities. A large amount of grain outside the city is pouring into the city.

　　蒋匪侵占及逃跑时
  　烟台遭受浩劫
    【新华社烟台十二日电】著名商港烟台在国民党匪帮侵占时与逃跑时所受浩劫，出人意外。在敌人侵占的一年多时间中，许多工厂主被迫逃亡或致死，生产大部陷于停顿。全市铁工业在敌“借用”名义下，共损失车床三十余部。民主政府时期的九十一家铁工厂，经敌一年蹂躏，到光复时，只残存十四家。纺织厂亦由一百五十六家减至二十一家。规模较大之“瑞丰”面粉公司，在去年敌占烟台之前，曾获民主政府三百万元之北海币之贷款而生产发展；敌占后，因原料、动力缺乏从未开工，且被敌强征军粮或借口“经济犯”等勒索粮食二十八万斤，使该公司资本枯竭。此次敌逃出烟台前，又将该公司仅剩之二十余袋大米和几百条面袋全部抢去。全国闻名的张裕酿酒公司，赖以制酒的七百亩葡萄树，被敌兵砍伐甚多，护围的铁丝网亦被拆去修了工事。该公司监理张剑辉，被敌扣押一年，右腿已被折磨的不能行动。德顺兴造钟厂，被敌兵抓了七名工人去当兵，经理马德仁忧病致死。同顺烟草公司，每月被迫向敌缴税粮六千余斤，被抢去纸烟五十二箱及煤四十二吨，该厂经理王雨山被迫逃亡。敌人在逃离烟台前，抓人抢劫尤其疯狂。东记汽车公司两辆大卡车被抢走，电灯公司机器除一部前已被敌损毁拆运外，敌逃窜时又将仅剩之三部发电机的七条炭金切断，重要机件全被抢去。海坝工程会的挖泥船、汽船及码头上的舢舨等，或被拉走、或被毁坏，无一幸存。码头上被抓捕去壮丁约达万人。全市二千余中学生，大部被强迫拉走。全市电气业工人一百四十五人，被抓去者一百三十八人。许多被抓壮丁的家属在码头上呼夫唤子，敌兵竟开枪镇压，有妇女当时即投海自尽者。市民经此浩劫，对国民党匪帮无不切齿痛恨。光复以后，市民重新得到了光明与温暖，民主政府正积极设法恢复市内电灯、电话以及海关等设施。市外大批粮食正源源入市。
