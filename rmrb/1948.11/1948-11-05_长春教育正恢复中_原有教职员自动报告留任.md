Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 3rd. Changchun's education, which was severely damaged by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, is now recovering. Since the Democratic Government Education Bureau started working on October 21st, the original staff have been bringing their credentials to register for employment. The principals and faculty members of twelve municipal and provincial middle schools have also reported to the bureau, submitting written reports on the general situation of the schools and various statistical forms. More than 70 primary schools in the city have already started classes, and the rest are actively preparing to resume classes. Changchun University has been properly taken over by the democratic government. Professors, lecturers, and staff of the university have also voluntarily registered. Most of the staff members of the puppet Jilin Provincial Department of Education who fled to Changchun have registered and are awaiting processing. The Municipal Education Bureau is pre-paying salaries to all employed staff, half in grain and half in cash. The staff, who have been suffering from hunger for a long time, are extremely grateful for this. Before the liberation of Changchun, the lives of education workers and students were extremely miserable, and the number of unemployed and out-of-school people increased sharply. Two years ago, there were 5,000 middle school students in the city, but only 1,000 were left before liberation; the number of faculty and staff members was originally more than 150, but now only 90 are left. Two years ago, there were a total of 70 primary schools, but before this liberation, they had been reduced to 20, and the number of students had decreased from 35,000 to 4,400. Many schools were used by the Kuomintang as military camps and hospitals, most of the school's instruments and books were lost, and many young students were left on the streets or even forcibly conscripted into the army. After this liberation, people in the education sector have been complaining about the Kuomintang's atrocities and expressed their willingness to serve the people's education under the leadership of the democratic government in the future.

    长春教育正恢复中
    原有教职员自动报告留任
    【新华社长春三日电】备受蒋匪摧残的长春教育事业正恢复中。自民主政府教育局十月二十一日开始办公后，原有职员均携带证明文件前来登记供职。市立、省立十二个中学校长和教职员等，亦到局报到，并呈缴学校一般情况的书面报告及各种统计表册。全市七十余所小学已有一部开学，其余正在积极筹备复课。长春大学已由民主政府妥为接收。该学教授、讲师、职员等亦自动报名登记。流亡长春之伪吉林省教育厅职员，大部分均已登记，听候处理。市教育局对任职职工，一律预支薪资，其中粮款各半。久困饥饿中的职工获粮后，对此极表感激。长春未解放前，教育工作人员与学生的生活苦不堪言，失业失学人数大增。两年前全市有中学生五千人，解放前只剩一千；教职员原有百五十余人，现只剩九十人。两年前小学共有七十所，此次解放前已减至二十所，学生从三万五千人减至四千四百人。许多学校被国民党充作军营、病院、校中仪器书籍大部失散，许多青年学生流落街头甚至被强征入伍。此次解放后，教育界人士纷纷诉述国民党之虐政，并表示今后愿在民主政府领导下为人民教育事业服务。
