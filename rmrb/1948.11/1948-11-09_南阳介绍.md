Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. Nanyang, formerly known as Wan, is an important town in southwestern Henan Province with a population of over 80,000. Highways extend in all directions. The Nanping Road passes through Xiping Town in Xichuan County and leads directly to Xi'an. The Wan-Zheng Highway passes through Deng County and leads directly to Laohekou, an important town in northern Hubei. The Wan-Xu (Xuchang), Wan-Luo (Luoyang), and Wan-Xin (Xinyang) highways all originate here, and there are highways connecting various counties and towns. The county seat is located on the west bank of the Bai River. The Bai River leads directly to Xiangyang and Fancheng. During the summer and autumn floods, wooden boats travel back and forth, making transportation very convenient. To the north are the Funiu Mountains, and to the southeast are the Tongbai Mountains, making it a strategically important location and the gateway to Sichuan and Shaanxi. The enemy's 13th Pacification Zone Headquarters is located here. The entire city has fourteen middle schools and more than ten primary schools, with over 10,000 students. Industry and commerce are relatively developed. Handicraft products, local products, and foreign goods from various counties in the Wan area are all distributed here. Nanyang silk is famous at home and abroad, and sales were very large before the Anti-Japanese War. Zhenping, Xinye, and Nanyang homespun cloth sell well in the northwestern provinces. Secondly, Nanyang and Deng County tobacco, Sheqi Town's cowhide and white wine, and Neixiang's paint and medicinal materials are also very famous. There are more than twenty large-scale cigarette factories and small iron factories in the city, as well as many small workshops for jade carving, silk weaving, cloth weaving, winemaking, and oil pressing. The city gates are connected, shaped like plum blossoms, giving it the nickname "Plum Blossom City." Seven li southwest of the city is Wolonggang and the Wuhou Temple, said to be the place where Zhuge Liang lived in seclusion. To the north gate is the Xuan Temple, now one of the few ancient forests in the country, but it has been severely damaged. Ten li northwest is Jingang, one of the important Catholic dioceses in Henan Province. Land in various counties of the Wan area is relatively concentrated, and landlord groups in each county have armed forces, so there are many bandits, especially in Zhenping, Neixiang, Xichuan, and Deng Counties. The Kuomintang reactionary government attaches great importance to them and often provides support and training. The leaders of the local bandits are local tyrants who commit all kinds of evils, including conscripting soldiers, seizing grain, levying money, planting opium, arson, murder, and rape. Since the People's Liberation Army crossed the river to the south last autumn, most of the local bandits have been wiped out, and a small number of remnants, local chief villains, and the Kuomintang county governments and county party headquarters of various counties in the Wan area have all concentrated in Nanyang. Since the enemy designated Nanyang as a pacification zone, they have built an airport, destroying more than ten hectares of good farmland, and built city defense fortifications, demolishing thousands of civilian houses. In the past year, Kuomintang bandit troops and local bandits have plundered, conscripted labor, levied exorbitant taxes, and the people have suffered unspeakable misery.

　　南阳介绍
    【新华社陕北七日电】南阳古称宛，为豫西南重镇，人口约计八万以上。公路四通八达，南坪路经淅川之西坪镇直达西安，宛郑公路经邓县直达鄂北重镇老河口，宛许（许昌）、宛洛（洛阳）、宛信（信阳）公路均以此为起点，各县镇间并有公路联络。县城濒白河西岸，白河直通襄阳樊城，夏秋水涨，木船往来不绝，交通运输非常方便。北有伏牛山、东南有桐柏山、形势险要，为川陕门户。敌第十三绥靖区司令部即设置于此。全城有中等学校十四所，小学校十余所，学生万余人。工商业相当发达，宛属各县手工业制品，土产及外来货物皆以此为集散地。南阳绸驰名国内外，抗战前销路很大，镇平、新野、南阳土布畅销西北各省。其次，如南阳、邓县烟叶，赊旗镇牛皮、白酒，内乡油漆药材等均甚著名。城内有规模较大卷烟工厂及小型铁工厂二十余家，琢玉、织绸、织布、酿酒、榨油等小型作坊甚多。城关相连，状如梅花，有梅花城称号。城西南七里有卧龙冈、武侯祠，相传为诸葛亮隐居地。北关有玄庙，现为国内有数古林，今已破坏不堪。西北十里有靳冈，为天主教河南省重要教区之一。宛属各县土地较为集中，各县地主集团均有武装，因此土匪甚多，其中尤以镇平、内乡、淅川、邓县四县为最多，国民党反动政府非常重视，并经常接济培养。团匪首领即系恶霸，抓丁、抢粮、派款、种毒、烧杀、奸淫无恶不作。去年秋季人民解放军渡河南征以来，团匪大部就歼，少数残余，地方首恶及国民党宛属各县县政府、县党部均集中南阳。南阳自敌人划为绥靖区后，并修飞机场，毁农民良田十余顷，修筑城防工事，拆毁民房数千间。一年来国民党匪军与地方团匪四出抢掠，拉夫、拉丁，苛征暴敛，人民水深火热痛苦不堪。
