　　【Special Dispatch from This Newspaper】Regarding the election methods for delegates to the First Congress of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, the North China Workers' Representative Joint Conference has discussed several principles, which have been passed by the conference and handed over to the preparatory committee for specific implementation. The principles regarding the tasks of the First Congress of North China Workers' Representatives are determined as follows: (1) To convey and discuss the resolutions of the Sixth National Labor Congress, summarize the work of the North China workers' movement in the past, and determine future work guidelines. (2) To formulate the organizational law of the leading organ of the North China workers' movement—the North China Federation of Trade Unions—and elect the First Executive Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions accordingly. (3) To formulate the organizational law and election law of trade unions at all levels.
    Regarding the number of delegates and the allocation of delegates, in order to adapt to the development of the situation and the specific circumstances of North China, the number of delegates to the First Congress of North China Workers' Representatives is tentatively set at 400 to 500 (the specific number and allocation of delegates will be decided by the preparatory committee). When allocating the number of delegates, attention should be paid to taking care of the overall situation and deciding according to the actual situation such as the size of the area, the number of members, and the differences in enterprises; attention should be paid to the Kuomintang-occupied areas, and a certain number of invitations should be made; and attention should be paid to the election of representatives from newly liberated areas, private enterprises and factories, and women representatives, so that the trade union can truly represent all workers. A certain number of engineers, technicians, and staff members should be represented at the conference.
