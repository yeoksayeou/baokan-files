　　"Iron Walls" Breached
    ——An Account of Our Army Capturing the Three Defense Lines of Baoding
    Li Fu
    On November 13th, under a bright moon, a unit of the People's Liberation Army swiftly advanced towards Baoding across the silent plain. Under the powerful attack, the first defense line, over a丈 (zhàng, approx. 3.3 meters) deep and wide, was breached by our forces. The Chiang bandits guarding the line, like startled birds, turned and fled, and those who couldn't escape were quickly taken as our prisoners. Following this, Dingzhuang, Xiaoyingfang, Da Kangzhuang, Xiao Kangzhuang, and Xiao Chengezhuang were successively occupied by us, and the enemy troops defending the forts retreated into the second defense line.

    The second defense line was a strong defensive line for the Chiang bandits, with the trench being over two 丈 deep and wide. The banks of the trench were densely fortified with bunkers and individual shelters. There were underground bunkers and the shelters connected by a two-尺 (chǐ, approx. 0.33 meters) wide and three-尺 deep communication trench, with landmines laid on both sides. The Chiang bandits' city defense department strictly ordered the defense and regarded it as an "iron wall" defense line. At four o'clock in the morning on the 15th, the battle to attack the second defense line began. Our guns and cannons roared, and machine guns fired out thousands of lines of fire, with the artillery fire illuminating the sky red. Each of these heroes, every unit and every individual, came with their own plans for meritorious service. Everyone's heart was beating intensely, and sweat streamed from their faces to their necks.

    The stretcher-bearer civilian laborers from Anping and other places, accompanying the army, were as brave and miraculous as the troops. All the laborers eagerly volunteered to go to the front line to rescue the wounded, advancing with the army, following wherever the troops charged. They declared: For the sake of the liberation of all the people in the area, they would use all their strength to transport the wounded from the front. They also stated: "We will not return home until we complete our mission." Even the masses from the villages that had been ruled by the Chiang bandits for a long time actively participated in the war effort. The masses of Da Yang Village actively went to the front to carry the wounded and transport ammunition. A middle-aged villager told the reporter: "If the Eighth Route Army didn't come, we wouldn't be able to survive. This year alone, we had to pay over 130 斤 (jīn, approx. 0.5 kg) of grain per mu (approx. 0.067 hectares) in land tax. If Baoding is taken, the people will finally be relieved."

    The general attack began. Under the cover of our heavy fire, demolition experts Tian Lidong and × Changjiang bravely charged forward. There was a loud "＠!＠!＠!" sound, and the front of the defense line was blasted open. The soldiers then bravely charged forward, driving out the enemy from the front. Tian Lidong was originally preparing to recuperate due to an eye illness, but he repeatedly requested the leaders: "I can persevere, my illness is not serious. I am determined to complete the demolition mission and be a glorious demolition expert. I want to be the first to blow up the enemy's front and the first to rush across the defense line!" As a result, he finally gloriously completed his mission.

    After the troops occupied the front, they immediately developed along the defense line in two directions, north and south. The northern route used machine guns to cover the advance of flying mines, capturing four enemy bunkers. When they reached the vicinity of the Triangle Building, the enemy used heavy fire to stop our advance. The heroes of the Fourth Company rolled towards the enemy, and five comrades in the Third Platoon were wounded under the enemy's artillery fire. But this did not instill fear in the soldiers, but rather fueled their determination to avenge the wounded. Zhang Jixiang, the deputy squad leader of the Eighth Platoon, continued to fight bravely despite being wounded. In this way, under the brave charge of our soldiers, the enemy at the Triangle Building was repelled, and our army then occupied Xiao Songzhuang. The Seventh Company acted swiftly and occupied the Spiral Fortress in a dozen minutes. The enemy fled in disarray, and our army immediately pursued them to Wangjia Hutong, capturing five enemies and seizing a small cannon. At six o'clock in the afternoon, they occupied Dongguan. The southern route continued to advance towards Xinzha, driving out the enemy, occupying the position, capturing eleven enemies, and seizing a machine gun and over one hundred and ten rifles, and taking advantage of the victory to develop towards the Electric Company. Under the heroic charge of our army, all the bunkers outside the three defense lines were eliminated, Dongguan was completely occupied, and the troops continued to advance towards the city walls.

　　“铜墙铁壁”被突破
    ——我军攻破保定三道市沟记
    力夫
    十一月十三日，月亮正明，人民解放军某部，在静寂的平原上，迅速向保定方向驰进。在强大火力攻击下，深、宽丈余的第一道市沟为我突破。守卫该线的蒋匪象惊弓之鸟，回头就跑，逃跑不及就迅速作了我们的俘虏。随着定庄、小营坊、大、小康庄，小陈各庄，先后为我占领，守堡匪军缩进二道沟。
    二道市沟是蒋匪牢固的防线，沟宽、深两丈余，沟岸密设碉堡及单人掩体，暗堡与掩体之间有一宽二尺深三尺的运动沟联系着，两旁设有地雷。蒋匪城防部严令防守，并视为“铜墙铁壁”之防线。十五日早四点，攻打二道市沟的战斗开始，我枪炮齐鸣，机枪飞射出万条火线，炮火映红了天空。这些英雄们，每一单位每一个人，都是带着自己立功计划来的，每个人的心都紧张的跳着，汗从脸上流到脖子里。
    安平等地随军的担架民工，和部队一样的英勇神奇，全体民工争着报名到火线救护伤员，随军前进，部队冲到那里，他们跟到那里。他们声言：为了全区老百姓的翻身，要用一切力量把前边的伤员转运下来。并提出：“不完成任务不回家。”就连被蒋匪长期统治的村庄的群众，也踊跃参战了，大洋村群众，积极到前方抬伤员，背炮弹。一个中年老乡对记者说：“八路军再不来我们就活不成了，这一年里光田赋就每亩拿一百三十多斤了，保定拿下来，老百姓就算松心了。”
    总攻开始了，在我重火力掩护下，雷手田立冬、×常江英勇冲上去，只听得“＠！＠！＠！”的巨响，市沟前沿爆破了，战士们随即勇猛冲上去，驱逐前沿敌人。田立冬本来是因眼病已准备休养的，他再三的向首长要求：“我能坚持，我的病不要紧，我坚决的完成爆破任务，当一个光荣的爆破手，我要第一个爆破敌人的前沿，第一个冲过市沟去！”结果他终于光荣的完成了任务。
    部队占领前沿后，随即分南北两路顺市沟发展，北路以机枪掩护飞雷前进，夺取敌人四个地堡。冲至三角楼附近，敌人用重火力阻止我前进，四连英雄们打着滚向敌冲去，在敌人炮火阻击下，三班五个同志负伤了，但这对战士不是恐惧，而是为伤者复仇的心燃烧着。八班副班长张计祥负伤不下火线，顽强坚持。就这样在我战士们勇敢的冲锋下，三角楼敌人被击退，我军继占小宋庄。七连动作迅猛，以十几分钟占领螺旋堡，敌人狼狈而逃，我军随即追到王家胡同，俘敌五名，缴获小炮一门。于下午六点占领东关。南路继向新闸进展，驱逐敌人，占领阵地，俘敌十一名，缴获机枪一挺，步枪一百一十余支，乘胜向电灯公司发展。在我军英勇的冲锋下，三道市沟外围的碉堡全部解决，东关全部占领，部队继续向城垣发展。
