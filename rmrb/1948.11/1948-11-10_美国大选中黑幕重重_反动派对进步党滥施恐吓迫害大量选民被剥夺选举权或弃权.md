　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. Reports from various sources: The US election held on the 2nd of this month was largely concluded by the evening of the 4th. Due to various anti-democratic restrictions and frantic political persecution, of the total 95 million eligible voters in the United States, only 66 million were registered and entitled to participate, and the actual participants, according to statistics up to the evening of the 4th, were only over 44 million. A large number of voters were deprived of their right to vote or abstained. According to the Associated Press on the evening of the 4th, based on statistics from over 125,000 precincts (out of a total of over 135,000 precincts), the Democratic Party's Truman received over 22.5 million votes, the Republican Party's Dewey received 20 million votes, the Progressive Party's Wallace received 1.05 million votes, and the States' Rights Democratic Party's Thurmond, which split from the Southern Democrats, received 910,000 votes. Truman won or led in 28 states (with 304 electoral votes), Dewey won or led in 16 states (with 189 electoral votes), and Thurmond led in 4 southern states (with 38 electoral votes). Wall Street's tools, Democratic presidential and vice-presidential candidates Truman and Barkley, have obtained more than half of the total 531 electoral votes needed to be elected president (i.e., 266 votes) and have been elected president and vice-president.
　　
　　In Congress, the Democratic Party has also changed from a minority party to a majority party. According to a report by the US News Service on the 3rd, the number of seats for the Democratic and Republican parties in the Senate will probably be 54 to 42, and in the House will be 247 to 261 versus 153 to 173. The Labor Party, which supports the Progressive Party, has won one seat in the House of Representatives. (Note: The ratio of seats held by the Democratic and Republican parties in the current 80th Congress is: 45 to 51 in the Senate, 184 to 243 in the House of Representatives, with 6 vacancies, and 2 seats for the American Labor Party.) In the re-election of 32 state governors, the Democratic Party is now also in the lead. Among the 48 state governor seats, originally divided equally between the two parties, the Democratic Party will increase to 30 to 32 seats.

　　According to TASS reports: In this election, the Progressive Party encountered enormous obstacles. The votes received by Wallace are not sufficient to reflect the true strength of the Progressive Party. Three states did not allow the Progressive Party candidates to be listed on the ballot, and in many precincts without Progressive Party poll watchers, local officials destroyed some Progressive Party ballots or did not report their vote counts. Reactionaries across the country also launched a frantic campaign of intimidation and persecution against the Progressive Party, especially in the southern states, where most citizens who could have supported the Progressive Party were deprived of their right to vote.

　　In this election, many elements with the most obvious reactionary faces have been defeated. According to United Press International on the 3rd, among the Republican and Democratic congressmen who supported the Taft-Hartley anti-labor bill, 80 members of the House of Representatives and 8 senators have been defeated, including Republican Hartley, chairman of the House Labor Committee and proposer of the bill. The notorious former US Ambassador to China, Republican Hurley, also failed again in the New Mexico Senate race.

　　美国大选中黑幕重重
    反动派对进步党滥施恐吓迫害大量选民被剥夺选举权或弃权
    【新华社陕北七日电】各方报导：本月二日举行的美国大选，至四日晚已大部揭晓。由于各种反民主的限制及疯狂的政治迫害，美国全部有资格的九千五百万选民中，登记有权参加者仅有六千六百万人，而实际参加者迄至四日晚的统计，只有四千四百余万人。大量选民被剥夺了选举权或者弃权。据美联社四日晚根据十二万五千余选区（全部为十三万五千余选区）的统计，民主党的杜鲁门共得二千二百五十余万票，共和党的杜威得二千万票，进步党的华莱士得一百零五万票，由美国南部民主党分裂出来的州权党的塞孟德得九十一万票。杜鲁门在二十八州（有选举人票三○四票）中获胜或占先，杜威在十六州（有选举人票一八九票）中获胜或占先，另有南方四州（有选举人票三八票）为塞孟德占先。华尔街的工具、民主党正副总统候选人杜鲁门及巴克莱已获得超过当选总统所需全部五三一选举人票之半数（即二六六票），当选为正副总统。
    在国会中，民主党亦已由少数党转为多数党。据美国新闻处三日报导，民主党与共和党在参院中的席次大概将为五四对四二，在众院将为二四七至二六一对一五三至一七三。拥护进步党的劳工党已当选众议员一席。（按：民主与共和两党在现在八十届国会中席次的比例是：参院为四十五对五十一，众院为一八四对二四三，另缺额六席，美国劳工党二席。）在三十二名的州长改选中，民主党现亦占先。在原来两党各占其半的四十八州州长席次中，民主党将增至三十至三十二席。
    据塔斯社报导：在这次选举中，进步党遭受到巨大的阻碍。华莱士所得的选票并不足以反映进步党的真正力量。有三个州不准进步党候选人列入选举名单中，在许多没有进步党监票员的选区，当地官吏就毁灭了进步党一些选票或不报告其选票数目。全国各地的反动派并对进步党发动了疯狂的恐吓运动与迫害，特别在南部各州，大多数本来能够支持进步党的公民被剥夺了投票权。
    在这次选举中，有许多反动面目暴露最明显的分子，已纷纷落选。据合众社三日电，赞成塔夫脱——哈特莱反劳工法案的共和、民主两党国会议员中，已有众议员八十名及参议员八人落选，包括该法案的提案人众院劳工委员会主席共和党人哈特莱在内。臭名远扬的前美国驻华大使、共和党人赫尔利，在这次新墨西哥州参议员竞选中，亦再次失败。
