　　Zhengzhou Railway Workers Spontaneously Organize
　　Protect Station Equipment and Welcome the People's Liberation Army

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 6th] When Zhengzhou was liberated, more than 4,000 workers at Zhengzhou Station on the Pinghan and Longhai Railways, disregarding the threats of the Kuomintang army, spontaneously organized to protect the station, trains, machines, and all transportation equipment, and warmly welcomed the arrival of the People's Liberation Army. This action demonstrated the fine tradition of the Chinese working class and set a glorious example for all workers now in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. When the Kuomintang army fled Zhengzhou in a panic on the 22nd of last month, they threatened the workers to destroy trains and equipment, but not a single employee on both lines did so. Under the slogan of "Protect our Rice Bowls - Trains," the Pinghan Railway workers were the first to organize. As soon as the enemy fled, they immediately took charge of all trains and equipment at the station and organized a picket team. Then the Longhai Railway workers also organized. These two worker teams ensured that all equipment at Zhengzhou Station was not damaged in the slightest. When the People's Liberation Army entered the station, more than 4,000 workers were overjoyed and came out to welcome them, shouting: "Support the People's Liberation Army, the Communist Party!" "The trains belong to the people!" "We must protect the wealth!" and other slogans. The workers immediately started working, going to work as usual, washing cars, repairing cars, and stoking fires. Every night, fifty or sixty workers on duty, together with the People's Liberation Army, patrolled the station back and forth, guarding the equipment to prevent sabotage by a few lawless elements. They enthusiastically said to the People's Liberation Army: "Knowing that you are coming, everyone has protected the machines well. The fire on the train heads hasn't even been extinguished. We are just waiting to drive the train for our army! Whenever the People's Liberation Army needs it, just give an order and we will drive the train immediately." The Pinghan and Longhai Railway Offices have now been established and are actively working on repairing the railway.

　　Another dispatch: The Zhengzhou Municipal People's Government was established on October 28th. The mayor is Song Zhihe, the former Deputy Director of the Administrative Office of the Yuxi Liberated Area.

　　郑州铁路工人自动组织起来
  　保护车站器材迎接解放军
    【新华社郑州六日电】郑州解放时，平汉、陇海两铁路郑州站四千余工人不顾国民党军的威胁，自动组织起来保护车站、火车、机器及一切交通器材，并热烈欢迎解放军的到达。此一举动，表现了中国工人阶级的优良传统，给所有现在国民党统治区内的工友们树立了一个光荣的榜样。上月二十二日郑州国民党军狼狈逃窜时，曾威胁工人破坏火车、器材，但两路员工没有一个人这样做。在“保护我们的饭碗——火车”的口号下，平汉路工人首先组织起来。敌人刚一逃走，他们便马上将车站上的一切火车、器材看管起来，并组织了纠察队。接着陇海路工人也组织起来。这两支工人队伍，使郑州车站上的一切器材未遭丝毫破坏。解放军进入车站时，四千余工人欢腾万分，纷纷出来欢迎，高喊着：“拥护解放军，共产党！”“火车是人民的！”“咱们要好好地保护财富！”等口号。工人们马上开始工作，照常上班、洗车、修车、烧火，每夜并有五六十号值班工人和解放军一起在车站上往返巡逻、看守器材，以防少数不法之徒的破坏。他们热情地向解放军说：“知道你们来了，大家把机器都保护得好好的，车头上连火都没有熄，就等着给咱们军队开车哩！解放军什么时候需要，一声命令，我们马上就开车。”现平汉、陇海铁路办事处业已成立，正在积极进行修复铁路工作中。
    又讯：郑州市民主政府业于十月二十八日成立，市长为原豫西解放区行政公署副主任宋致和。
