Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Front, 2nd: The Northeast People's Liberation Army completely liberated Shenyang, the largest city in Northeast China, today, and all defending enemies were eliminated. After our troops entered the city, the masses, who had long been oppressed by the Chiang bandits, lined the streets to welcome them. Order in the city is being rapidly restored.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 2nd: The news of Shenyang's liberation was broadcast by the Northeast Xinhua Broadcasting Station today, and all the soldiers and civilians in Northeast China were overjoyed. The Northeast Liberation War has now been completely victorious. The glorious task of the Northeast People's Liberation Army and the people of Northeast China is to fully participate in and assist the people's liberation cause within the customs. The rapid and complete liberation of Northeast China will undoubtedly accelerate the liberation of all of China.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 2nd: Introduction to Shenyang and nearby important industrial and mining cities:

Shenyang, Fushun, Benxi, and Anshan are China's largest industrial and mining centers. Here, the production of coal, iron, and steel, which are the foundation of heavy industry, ranks first in the country. In addition, there are the largest railway factories, ordnance factories, cement factories, and many chemical industries and a fairly highly developed light industry.

Shenyang is the first major city in Northeast China. The city is located on the north bank of the Liao River, in the center of the South Manchurian Plain. At its peak, it had a population of over two million, and now has a population of approximately 1.8 million. It is the starting point of the Anshan-Shenyang and Shenyang-Jilin railways, the terminal of the Beining Railway, the midpoint of the Changchun-Lushun section of the Changxin Railway, and the starting point of its branch line to Yingkou. Before Japan's surrender, there were nearly a thousand medium-sized and large factories in the city, including machinery, appliances, textiles, metal industry, chemical, glass, food, paper making, printing, tobacco, and other light and heavy industries. After Japan's surrender, during the Kuomintang's rule, "takeover" and plunder, eight or nine out of ten factories closed down. In 1931, during the "September 18th" Incident, Chiang Kai-shek abandoned Shenyang without resistance, causing this famous city in Northeast China to fall into the hands of Japanese invaders for fourteen years. During these fourteen years, the people of Shenyang suffered all kinds of humiliation. After the liberation of Northeast China on August 15, 1945, the people were overjoyed to be reborn, but unexpectedly, Chiang Kai-shek used the excuse of "taking over sovereignty" to seize Shenyang from the hands of the people on March 12, 1946, and used it as a base for invading all of Northeast China. Since 1947, the Northeast People's Liberation Army has turned to the offensive, and the Chiang-occupied areas in Northeast China have shrunk day by day. Since the spring of this year, Shenyang and its periphery have been completely isolated. After the launch of our army's autumn offensive this year, in less than two months, we successively won three major victories in liberating Jinzhou, liberating Changchun, and annihilating the 12 divisions of the Liao Yaoxiang Corps, and the situation of the Chiang army in Shenyang became increasingly critical. Although the Chiang bandit flew to Shenyang three times in one month to personally direct the battle, each time it accelerated the collapse of the Chiang bandits in Northeast China. This largest city in Northeast China returned to the hands of the people on November 2nd.

Fushun, known as China's "Coal Capital," is located 35 kilometers northeast of Shenyang, with an urban population of 370,000 during the puppet Manchurian period. The Fushun coal mining area is 17 kilometers from east to west and 4 kilometers from north to south, covering approximately 60 million square meters. The total reserves are 500 million tons, and the highest annual output can reach over 10 million tons, accounting for 74% of the total coal production in Northeast China. The coal mine in this area not only has large reserves but also has extremely thick coal seams. The thickest part in the west is 120 meters, the thinnest part in the east is 15 meters, and the average thickness is 36 meters. In addition to coal mines, there are also large-scale power plants, gas factories, and light and heavy industries such as machinery, kilns, oil shale, synthetic gasoline, and aluminum production. On August 15th, Fushun was once liberated by our army, but was invaded by the Chiang bandits again on March 21, 1946. Since then, coal production has sharply declined, with the highest monthly output not reaching 140,000 tons, and most of the mining areas have been flooded, with daily output insufficient for power generation.

Benxi, known for its coal and iron industry, is located 70 kilometers southeast of Shenyang. The urban area is located in a narrow area along the Taizi River. According to a survey by the Japanese Iron and Steel Corporation, Benxi has coal reserves of approximately 370 million tons, iron reserves of 457 million tons, other mineral reserves of 157 million tons, and 2.5 million tons of pyrite. In addition to large-scale iron mining companies, the Japanese also established large factories for special steel, cement, bauxite, bricks, tiles, timber, and papermaking in this area, and established a large-scale machinery manufacturing plant in the Gongyuan area south of Benxi. After August 15th, Benxi was first liberated by us, but was invaded by the Chiang bandits on May 3, 1946. It was once recovered by us during last year's summer offensive.

Anshan, located 80 kilometers south of Shenyang, between Liaoyang and Haicheng on the Middle East Railway, is the location of one of the largest steel mills in the Far East, known as the "Steel Capital." Its iron reserves reach 600 million tons, accounting for 75% of the total iron ore reserves in Northeast China. Before Japan's surrender, it could produce 700,000 tons of pig iron and 500,000 tons of steel annually. After August 15th, we once liberated it, but it was later invaded by the Chiang bandits. It was recovered by us on February 19th of this year. In October, the enemy in Shenyang attempted to escape to Yingkou via Anshan Haicheng and briefly invaded the area, but was now liberated again.

    我军完全解放沈阳
    东北解放战争大功告成必将加速全中国的解放
    【新华社沈阳前线二日电】东北人民解放军今日完全解放东北最大城市沈阳，守敌全部解决。我军入城后，久受蒋匪压迫的群众夹道欢迎。城市秩序正迅速恢复中。
    【新华社哈尔滨二日电】沈阳解放的消息，今日由东北新华广播电台播出后，全东北各地军民莫不欢欣鼓舞。东北解放战争至此已大功告成，东北人民解放军和东北人民今后的光荣任务就是全力参加和援助关内的人民解放事业。东北的迅速全部解放，无疑将要达到加速全中国的解放。
    【新华社哈尔滨二日电】沈阳及其附近重要工矿业城市介绍：
    沈阳、抚顺、本溪、鞍山，是中国最大的工矿业中心。在这里，作为重工业生产基础的煤、铁和钢的产量在全国都占第一位。此外，还有最大的铁路工厂、兵工厂、水泥厂及许多化学工业和相当高度发展的轻工业。
    沈阳是东北第一个大城市。城濒辽河北岸，处南满大平原的中心，最盛时拥有人口二百余万，现有人口约一百八十万。是安沈、沈吉两条铁路的起点，北宁铁路的终点，长新铁路长（春）旅（顺）段的中点及其通营口支线的起点。日本投降前，市内中型以上的工厂将近一千家，包括机械、器具、纺织、金属工业、化学、玻璃、食品、造纸、印刷、烟草等轻重工业。日本投降后，经国民党统治时期的“接收”劫夺，工厂倒闭者十之八、九。一九三一年“九一八”事变，蒋介石不抵抗而放弃沈阳，使此东北名城陷于日寇之手达十四年之久。十四年中沈市人民受尽了凌辱。一九四五年“八·一五”东北解放后，人民方庆苏生，不意蒋介石借口“接收主权”于一九四六年三月十二日将沈阳由人民手中夺取，并以其为侵掠全东北的基地。一九四七年以来，东北解放军转入攻势，东北蒋占区日益缩小。今年春季以后，沈阳及其外围已完全孤立。今年我军秋季攻势发动后，不及两个月，即接连获得解放锦州、解放长春及全歼廖耀湘兵团十二个师的三次大捷，沈阳蒋军形势愈见危殆。蒋贼虽在一月之内三度飞临沈阳，亲自指挥作战，但每一次都加速了东北蒋匪的崩溃。这一个东北最大的城市，于十一月二日重归人民之手。
    被称为中国“煤都”的抚顺，位于沈阳东北三十五公里，市区人口在伪满时达三十七万。抚顺煤矿区，东西十七公里，南北四公里，约六千余万平方公尺，全部储量达五万万吨，最高年产量可达一千余万吨，占东北全部煤产百分之七十四。该区煤矿不仅储量大，且煤层极厚，西部最厚处达一百二十公尺，东部最薄部亦达十五公尺，平均厚三十六公尺。除煤矿外并有大规模的发电所、瓦斯工厂及机械、窑业、油母贝岩、人造汽油、制铝等轻重工业。“八一五”时，抚顺曾经我军解放，一九四六年三月二十一日又为蒋匪侵占。此后煤的产量锐减，每月最高产量未达十四万吨，大部矿区均被水淹，日产量不足发电之用。
    以煤铁工业著称的本溪，距沈阳东南七十余公里，市区位于太子河沿岸之狭长地区。据日寇钢铁株式会社调查，本溪煤之储藏量约三亿七千万吨，铁之储藏量四亿五千七百万吨，另有其他矿藏一亿五千七百万吨及硫化铁二百五十万吨。除大规模之铁矿公司外，日寇并于此设有特殊钢、洋灰、白云母、砖瓦、木料、造纸等大工厂多处，并于本溪以南之宫原地区设大规模机械制造厂。“八一五”后，本溪为我首次解放，四六年五月三日被蒋匪侵占，去年夏季攻势中曾为我一度收复。
    在沈阳南八十余公里的鞍山，在中长路上辽阳与海城之间，为远东最大的炼钢厂之一的所在地，有“钢都”之称。铁的蕴藏量达六万万吨，占东北铁矿总藏量的百分之七十五。日寇投降前，年可产铣铁七十万吨，钢材五十万吨。“八一五”后，我一度解放，后被蒋匪侵占，今年二月十九日为我收复。十月间沈阳之敌企图经鞍山海城通往营口逃走，曾一度侵陷该地，此次再告光复。
