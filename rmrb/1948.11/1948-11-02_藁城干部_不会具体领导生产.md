Gaocheng Cadres
Unable to Specifically Lead Production
[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The main problem discovered in Gaocheng County during the autumn harvest and wheat planting is that the leadership is not good at specifically leading mass production. There are many abstract calls and general slogans, but a lack of specific leadership that combines with the actual situation of the masses. Therefore, although they "attached importance to production leadership" and made many efforts, they could not obtain the due results. This inability to specifically lead is first reflected in the meetings and documents they discussed and deployed for production. In order to strengthen the leadership of the autumn harvest and wheat planting, the county held three consecutive cadre meetings in early, mid-, and early this month. The county party secretary himself believed that the first meeting's "deployment was not specific at the time, putting it on the shoulders of the district cadres, and it was even less specific when it reached the villages." There is no need to talk more about it. The county secretary believed that the second meeting's deployment was "very specific." However, its content was still very empty: "First, how to use organizational forces: (1) We must mobilize and use organizational forces to create a mass movement. Otherwise, the work will fail. In order to effectively complete the task, we must give practical and specific assistance plans, delineate work scope, and clarify tasks according to different villages and different forces, and deploy production to every corner. (2) Only by using organizational forces can we train flexible organizations, overcome undisciplined state, practically strengthen core organizations, enable them to lead and master the work in the village, and enable leading cadres to skillfully use their lower-level organizational forces. In practical movements, we can strengthen and experience the backbone active elements and the inactive, passive, and backward elements in the work. According to the specific situation, we can strengthen education, transform and adjust the organization, and lay the foundation for future party consolidation, so that party members and cadres can closely contact the masses and make an appropriate assessment of the central task. (3) The use of organizational forces must be organized, planned, and centered. Otherwise, it will be haphazard and the work steps will not be consistent, the work effect will not be great, and the lower levels will have no interest in or be tired of the work. In fact, it cannot strengthen and train the lower-level organizations. As long as the leading cadres leave the village, the work will stop. (4) Each district should make preliminary plans and steps for using organizational forces, allocate and use the strength of cadres, and specifically promote and control the work of the entire district, overcoming the past phenomenon of random grabbing." "Second, there are several issues of specific leadership: First, leadership must be combined with the masses; second, general leadership must be combined with individual leadership; third, core leadership must be cultivated; fourth, work must be specifically deployed, deeply led, problems must be discovered, and problems must be solved." It also made many explanations of general principles on leadership methods. The third is the work deployment: "After the district cadres arrive in the village, they first convene a branch meeting to mobilize, deploy, understand the situation, and publicize the policy, and use the exemplary actions of party members to influence and lead everyone; then convene meetings of the new farmers' association, the government, the production committee, and the militia, etc., to specifically divide the work, divide the streets and areas, assign each cadre to a few households, delineate the scope of work, and clarify the tasks; conduct cyclical inspections, discover and create experiences, and study and promote them; pay attention to the difficulties of village cadres, solve problems, expand influence, and break doubts." In short, it still talked a lot about the general principles and truths of leadership methods, but did not mention what work should be done, what tasks should be completed, and how to complete them. The deployment of the third meeting (early this month) still largely repeated the organizational leadership issues of the second meeting, requiring district cadres to "grasp key villages, so that their work can be further advanced and drive other villages; cultivate and improve the working ability of new cadres; grasp active elements to carry out specific work; district cadres should personally take action to lead production with production (i.e., participating in production); solve obstacles and various difficulties in production, expose various wrong ideas and understandings, vigorously publicize policies, and focus on solving problems or giving guarantees (referring to not increasing burdens, no longer equally dividing, etc.)." The specific work is mainly to organize: "In villages with existing organizations, continue to expand and improve them; in villages where the situation is not yet understood, first understand the old labor organization forms in the village, and grasp the active elements to take the lead in organizing inter-class mutual aid; for households lacking manpower and animal power, organize them to actively combine with households with manpower and animal power, and exchange other work for labor." What to do after being organized, this time it was more specific than before: "Continue to launch a blitz to plant wheat, solve the lack of manpower, animal power, seeds, and fertilizers, and the production difficulties of military dependents and revolutionary martyrs, eliminate wasteland, and launch a blitz of autumn plowing after planting wheat." Finally, it is necessary to "pay attention to the development of sideline production." But it still didn't specifically deploy how to do it: for example, how to specifically solve the lack of manpower and animal power? It would be good to introduce one or two reference methods for everyone to try, but there wasn't any. What are some wrong or bad practices that should be avoided when solving specific problems? There weren't any either.

What about the cadres' understanding and acceptance of these work deployments, and how well did they implement them? According to Chen Yutian, secretary of the Chengguan District Party Committee, after the first meeting, many cadres said, "You have deployed so much, but we still don't know what to do when we get to the bottom." When checking the implementation situation at the second meeting, the situation found was: "District cadres are at a loss when they arrive in the village; some are bureaucratic and cannot grasp the center; some work cannot be deployed and is empty; district cadres' work is floating, and when they arrive in the village, they still hold a cadre meeting to report the situation every day or two, but it still cannot solve the problem." "Some villages haven't moved at all." After the second deployment, because of the emphasis on using organizational forces, most villages in each district "organized" the village cadres. The fifth district divided the village cadres into groups and divided the whole village into sections, with each group leading a section, and each cadre specifically assigned a few households. What to do after assigning to the households? The cadres of Shunzhong Village said: "Publicize seed soaking, plant more wheat, and ask each household whether they have planted it and how much they have planted." Yang Laocun, deputy district chief of the second district, said: "The work has been deployed, but there is no work to do." Han Xiaosuo, propaganda cadre of the tenth district party committee, reported on the production work of Nanlong Palace, saying that out of 120 households in the village, more than 70 households were organized, but when asked about other things, he was unclear. Wang Changgui, the village chief of Beimacun in the fifth district, said: "Old Zhai (district cadre) is here holding meetings every day, but he can't achieve any results. Everyone is unwilling to go because they stay up half the night every day. We haven't finished planting wheat yet, but he insists on getting numbers." Some households in Shunzhong Village had not plowed their land or delivered manure by October 1 because their livestock had died; others could not plant more wheat because they had little manure. No one specifically led the solution of these problems. He Shulin, the branch secretary of the village, said: "If it hadn't rained and we didn't have to irrigate, we wouldn't have been able to plant much more this year." He obviously felt that there was no difference between having leadership and not having leadership. County magistrate Zhao Baiwu said after inspecting several villages in the fifth district: "Organizational forces have been used, but there is no content, and they don't know what to do."

Because the problems of what to do and how to do it have not been truly solved, when reviewing the implementation of the second meeting's resolutions at the recent third meeting, the work is still floating, running around randomly, failing to grasp the key points...etc., almost the same as last time. The county party committee did not review the previous two work deployments and the county's leadership, so the new deployment content has made no major progress. In short, the Gaocheng leadership has generally paid attention to production, and the leading cadres have indeed tried hard to do it, but because they cannot specifically lead, they have not yet truly touched the reality. This problem urgently needs to be solved.

### 藁城干部  不会具体领导生产

    藁城干部
    不会具体领导生产
    【本报特讯】藁城县在秋收种麦中发现的主要问题，是领导上不善于具体的领导群众生产，抽象的号召，一般口号很多，而缺乏与群众实际相结合的具体领导，所以他们虽然“重视了生产领导”，并做了不少努力，却不能获得应有的成绩。这种不善于具体领导，首先表现在他们讨论布置生产的会议与文件上。该县为加强秋收种麦领导，曾在九月上旬、中旬与本月上旬，连续召开过三次干部会议。第一次会议，连县委书记自己也认为“当时布置不具体，架到区干部身上，到村更不具体。”勿须多谈。第二次会议的布置，是县书认为“很具体”的。但它的内容却仍然很空洞：“第一、如何使用组织力量：（一）必须动员与使用起组织力量，造成群众运动。不然会落空工作，为了切实的完成任务，必须根据不同村庄不同力量给予切实的具体的帮助计划、划定工作范围、明确任务，将生产布置到每一个角落。（二）只有使用组织力量，才能锻炼灵通组织，克服无纪律状态，实际加强核心组织，使其领导掌握村中工作，领导干部才能熟练自己下层的组织力量，在实际运动中加强和体会工作中的骨干积极分子和不积极的、消极的、落后的分子，根据具体情况加强教育，改造调整组织，打下将来的整党基础，才能使党员干部密切的联系群众，能将中心任务作一适当的估价。（三）使用组织力量必须是有组织有计划有中心的，不然也会东拉西扯乱碰，工作步骤也不会一致，工作效果也不会大，使下层对工作无兴趣、厌烦，实际上也不能加强和锻炼下层组织，只要领导干部一离开村，工作就会停顿。（四）各区应作出使用组织力量的初步计划和步骤，分配和使用干部的力量，具体推动掌握全区的工作，克服过去乱抓乱扯的现象。”“第二、是具体领导的几个问题：一要领导与群众相结合；二要一般领导与个别相结合；三要培养核心领导；四要具体布置工作，深入领导，发现问题，解决问题。”其中也作了许许多多一般原理的解释。第三是工作布置：“区干部到村后，先召开支部会动员、布置，了解情况，宣传政策，以党员的模范行动影响带动大家；紧接着召开新农会、政权、生产委员、民兵等会，具体分工，划街划片，分配每个干部几户，划定工作范围，明确任务；循环检查，发现经验创造，研究推广；注意村干部的困难，解决问题，扩大影响，打破怀疑。”总之，仍是把领导方法上的一般原则道理讲了许多，究竟要做些什么工作，完成些什么任务，怎样完成，却没有提到。第三次会议（本月上旬）的布置，很大一部分，仍然重复了第二次会议上的组织领导问题，要求区干部“抓住重点村，使其工作先进一步，带动其他村；培养与提高新干部的工作能力；抓住积极分子具体进行工作；区干部要亲自下手，以生产（即参加生产）领导生产；解决生产中的障碍与各种困难，揭发各种错误思想与认识，大力宣传政策，有重点的解决问题或给以保证（指不增加负担，不再平分等）。”具体的工作，主要是组织起来：“在已有组织的村，继续扩大与提高一步；还不了解情况的村，先了解村中旧有的拨工组织形式，并抓住积极分子，带头组织插班互助；人畜力缺乏的户，组织他们主动与有人畜力户结合，拿别的活换工。”组织起来干什么，这次讲得比前具体：“要继续突击种麦，解决人畜力、种子、肥料缺乏与军干烈属的生产困难，消灭荒地，种麦后突击秋耕。”最后是要“注意发展副业生产”。但仍然没有具体布置怎样做：比如解决人畜力缺乏等，用什么办法具体进行？即使介绍一两种参考性质的办法给大家试用也好，但是没有。解决具体问题时有些什么错误的，不好的做法，应该避免，也没有。
    干部们对这些工作布置的领会接受怎样，执行得又怎样呢？据城关区区委书记陈玉田在第一次会议后谈，有许多干部说是“你们布置这么多，我们到了底下还是不知道怎么办。”在第二次会议上检查执行情形时，发现的情况是：“区干部到村束手无策；有的事务主义，抓不住中心；有的工作布置不下去，架了空；区干部工作漂浮，到村时照常一天或两三天召开一次干部会汇报情况，也解决不了问题”。“有的村根本没动”。第二次布置后，因强调使用组织力量，各区大部村庄都把村干“组织”了起来。五区把村干分成小组把全村分成片，每组领导一片，每个干部具体再分几户。分到户干什么呢？顺中村干部说：“宣传浸种，多种麦，问各户种上没有，种了多少。”二区副区长杨老存说：“工作布置下去啦，没活儿啦。”十区区委宣干韩小锁报告南龙宫的生产工作说，全村一百二十多户，组织起来七十多户，再问别的就闹不清了。五区北马村长王常贵说：“老翟（区干）在这里每天开会也开不出个成绩来，每天一熬多半夜，谁也不愿去啦，还没种完麦，硬要数目字。”顺中村有的户因死了牲口，至十月一日地没耕，粪没送；有的因为粪少，不能多种麦。这些问题却没人具体领导解决。该村支书何树林说：“要不是下了雨不用浇地，今年也多种不了什么。”他显然觉得领导不领导没什么分别。县长赵百武在五区检查了几个村以后说：“把组织力量使用起来了，但没有内容，不知道做什么。”
    由于做什么与怎样做的问题没真正解决，所以最近第三次会议上检讨二次会议决议执行情形时，仍然是工作漂浮，乱跑，抓不住重点……等等，与上次差不多。县委对前两次工作布置与县的领导则没有检讨，所以新的布置内容仍无大进展。总之，藁城领导上一般的是注意了生产，领导干部也确实努力去干，但因不会具体领导，所以直到现在仍未真正触及实际。这问题急待解决。
