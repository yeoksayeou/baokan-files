[Taihang Electric] The Sixth District United Cooperative of Lin County is constantly planning to organize mass production, which is supported by the broad masses. The cooperative was established in March 1946 after the production efforts of the district government. It started with an initial capital of 50,000 yuan, absorbing 350,000 yuan in shares from the masses of Zhao Guan Village, and developed through three people carrying goods for trade and one cotton gin. Since its establishment, it has grown rapidly due to the implementation of the policy of organizing mass production in its operations. In just over two years, its capital has increased to more than 13 million yuan, with 38 employees managing a flour mill, a woodworking factory, a leather workshop, four water mills, and two retail stores. During the agricultural off-season, the cooperative provided salt to mutual aid teams in various villages, allowing them to exchange it for wheat in Qi County, resulting in significant profits. On one occasion, the salt exchanged for 6,000 jin of millet and 5,000 jin of wheat. The cooperative emphasized creditworthiness in its loans, setting a five-day deadline, with interest charged for overdue payments. If payment could not be made on time, a reason had to be provided, and an extension could be granted if necessary. The cooperative cleared accounts monthly, and overdue payments were rare. To facilitate the sale and purchase of wheat and to assist village cooperatives and the masses in selling sideline products and purchasing raw materials, the cooperative also opened a retail store in Linqi Town, Lin County. Since its establishment, it has helped eight villages and over 70 paper-making households to sell their products, purchase raw materials, and provided them with loans. It has truly played a supporting role in the production of village cooperatives and the masses. When autumn plowing and wheat planting arrived, there was a shortage of draft animals in Linqi Town. The cooperative organized its two pairs of livestock to help the masses with autumn plowing and wheat planting, charging only one dou of wheat per mu, which was cheaper than the general rate, so the masses eagerly used them. In addition, the cooperative allowed the masses to exchange wheat for flour at the water mills, saving a large amount of labor and animal power for a concentrated effort to plant wheat. During the land reform in the spring of 1947, a large number of trees and planks were seized from feudal landlords. The cooperative opened a woodworking factory to manufacture spinning wheels, looms, bellows, saddles, plows, etc., to meet the production needs of the masses. Later, after further research, they created wind bows, solving the problem of tool shortages for the masses.

Because the business direction was correct and helped the masses develop production, it was also very profitable. In the first three months, each yuan of stock paid a dividend of 1.6 yuan; in the second six-month period, each yuan of stock paid a dividend of 1.2 yuan. When the cooperative was established, it stipulated that shareholding and withdrawal of shares were free and unrestricted, and anything could be used as a share. The masses felt this method was very convenient, so not only did they not withdraw their shares, but they also mostly converted their dividends into shares. Zhang Youcai's wife, a military dependent in Shangzhuang, said, "When I invested, it was only 9,000 yuan, but now it's more than 50,000. I won't withdraw it; I'll spend it when my child grows up and gets married."

　　组织供销扶助生产
  　林县六区区联社发展得快
    【太行电】林县六区区联社时刻为组织群众生产打算，受到广大群众拥护。该社是在一九四六年三月区公所机关生产结束后，就原有的五万元家当，又吸收了赵官村群众股金三十五万元，靠三个人担挑贸易和一个轧花车发展起来的。自成立以来，由于业务上贯彻了组织群众生产的方针，所以发展壮大得很快。在短短的二年多中，资金增至一千三百万余元，三十八个职员，经营着粉坊、木工厂、皮匠铺各一座，和四盘水磨，两个门市部。农闲季节时，该社赊给各村互助组盐，叫他们到淇县换麦子，结果获利很大。有一次赊出的盐换回小米六千斤，麦子五千斤。在赊帐上强调了讲信用，限期五天，过期出利，到期给不了必须说明理由，必要时可以展期。社里一月一清帐，一般没有过期的。为便利销麦购麦与帮助各村社及群众推销副业生产品，购买原料，该社又在林县区淇镇开了个门市部。成立以来，帮助八个村七十多户造纸的推销了成品，代购回原料，并贷给他们款。对村社和群众生产真正起了扶助的作用。秋耕种麦到来时，临淇镇的畜力很困难，该社把自己的两犋牲口组织起来给群众秋耕种麦，每犁一亩只收一市斗麦子的工价，因为比一般牲口便宜，群众都抢着用。另外，该社允许群众到水磨上以麦换面，节余出一大批劳力和畜力去突击种麦。一九四七年春土改时，斗争出封建地主一大批树木和木板，该社开设了一座木工厂，制造纺花车、织布机、风匣、驮鞍、犁等，供给群众生产需要。后来又经研究，造出风弓，解决了群众工具困难。
    因为业务方向正确，帮助群众发展了生产，所以也就很赚钱，头一次三个月，每元分红一元六；第二期半年，每元分红一元二。该社成立时就规定抽股入股自由，不受限制，有啥入啥。这种方法，群众感觉很方便，所以不但不抽股，连红利也多作成了股金。上庄军属张有财老婆说：“俺入股时才九千元，现在成了五万多，俺可不抽；等俺孩大了娶媳妇时花哩。”
