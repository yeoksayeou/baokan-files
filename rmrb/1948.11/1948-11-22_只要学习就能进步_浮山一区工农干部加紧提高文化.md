　　As Long as You Study, You Can Improve
　　Fushan First District Workers and Peasants Cadres Intensify Efforts to Improve Education
　　[Taiyue Electric] Zheng Jingxiao, chairman of the Fushan First District Farmers' Association, patiently guides workers and peasants cadres in learning culture and improving their work ability. On October 24th, when district cadres gathered in the Dong’erli community to review their studies, Chen Cunqi said, "My brain is too muddled to be of any use; I'm over thirty years old, what's the point of studying?" Chang Jingde said, "We're only qualified to be messengers." Yang Zijun said, "We're just crude people, we can't learn!" Everyone felt that as the situation developed, they were increasingly incapable and had no future. To stimulate the enthusiasm for learning, Comrade Zheng Jingxiao awakened everyone's consciousness by starting with the progress they had already made. He asked in return, "Are we really of no use? Let's compare each of us when we first started working with now." Chang Jingde thought for a moment and said, "When I started working last year, I didn't know a single character. Comrade Zheng Jingxiao guided me to study, learning one character a day. Now I can write words like 'landlord,' 'rich peasant,' 'middle peasant,' 'poor peasant,' etc., and I can also write some village names, and I know which stroke to write first and which to write later for a character. I don't agree with the saying 'studying is useless.' If I learn one character a day, I'll learn three thousand six hundred characters in ten years. If I learn three characters a day, the characters I learn in another ten years will be inexhaustible." Chen Jifang said, "I used to recognize a few characters, but I couldn't write well. When the higher-ups conveyed work, I didn't take notes because I was afraid people would laugh at me. Comrade Jingxiao taught me to take notes, writing even if I couldn't, writing as many sentences as I could. Now I can write simple notes." In this way, many comrades saw the progress they had made since starting work, breaking the negative emotions of "not being able to learn" and "having no hope." Only Comrade Chen Cunqi still stubbornly said, "I am of no use. When I worked in Zhuge Village last year, I read a book and wrote a small notebook of new characters, but now I've forgotten everything. I can only complete my work tasks." In order to persuade him, Comrade Jingxiao took out the study notes of several comrades and himself over the years for everyone to see. The characters in the previous notes were of different sizes, uneven in thickness, and the lines were crooked; now they are much neater. Then, he put forward Comrade Liu Jingying, a model of learning, to teach everyone to learn from him. Liu Jingying was originally a messenger in the district office, illiterate. But he asked people whenever he saw them, writing forcefully if he couldn't write, memorizing forcefully if he couldn't memorize, copying newspapers, copying notes, studying without stopping work. After four years of effort, he can now actually take notes. But Chen Cunqi still said, "I can only complete my work tasks, I don't have time to study." At this time, everyone criticized him. They all said, "You can still read and look at books, are you not as good as Little Liu? The main thing is that you are unwilling to work hard." Chen Cunqi frowned, held his head, and lay down for a long time. Finally, he jumped up and said, "Am I not as good as Little Liu?" He also made up his mind to study. In order to consolidate everyone's learning enthusiasm, Comrade Jingxiao recited a section of the document on how Soviet organ personnel should work, and everyone was further enlightened. Zhang Weiyong said, "In the past, not studying meant lacking the spirit of serving the people." Yang Zijun said, "Now I know that studying is related to the life and death, happiness and misfortune of the people, and we must study!" Chang Jingde said, "If we are unwilling to study, we are the dust that Chairman Mao spoke of. We must study hard, wash our faces often, and wash away the dust." After this discussion, everyone's learning confidence and enthusiasm improved. Then, a plan was made to study the two documents of 1933 and the Party Constitution. In addition, different learning plans were made according to each person's different level: Chang Jingde's level was low, so he insisted on recognizing one character a day and learning to write sentences; Yang Zijun's level was slightly higher, so he learned to take notes; Chen Xiufang's level was even higher, so she also had to learn to summarize materials. Zhang Weiyong could read books and write, but had little practical work experience, so he studied analyzing problems, writing drafts, and summarizing work. Zheng Jingxiao had more work experience, so he studied reading newspapers and learning theory. Chen Cunqi copied newspapers, copied notes, and memorized new characters every day. Everyone was working very energetically.

　　只要学习就能进步
  　浮山一区工农干部加紧提高文化
    【太岳电】浮山一区农会主席郑敬孝耐心诱导工农干部学习文化，提高工作能力。十月二十四日区干部在东二里小区集会检讨学习时，陈存祺说：“我这脑子糊涂的不算话；咱又三十多岁了，还学习那干啥哩？”常景德说：“咱只有当通信员的资格。”杨子俊说：“咱是个粗鲁人，学不会！”大家都觉得形势越开展，自己越没办法，越没前途。郑敬孝同志为激发学习的心劲，就从大家已有的进步上来唤醒大家的自觉，他反问：“咱们真的不算话啦？咱们每个人都把参加工作的时候和现在比比看。”常景德想了一回说：“我去年参加工作时，一个字也不识；郑敬孝同志领导我学习，一天学一个字，我现在能写‘地主’、‘富农’、‘中农’、‘贫农’等字，还会写些村名，也知道一字应先写那一画，后写那一画。我不赞成‘学习也不行’的话。我每天学一个字，十年学三千六百字，假若每天学三个字，再停十年学的字就用不完了。”陈季芳说：“我以前认得几个字，写不好，上边传达工作，我就不记，怕人笑话；敬孝同志教我记笔记，写不上也硬写，能写几句算几句，我现在能写上简单笔记了。”这样，许多同志都看到了自己参加工作以来学习的进步，打破了“学不好”和“没希望”的消极情绪。只有陈存祺同志还是顽强的说：“我是不算话。去年在诸葛村工作时，看了一本书，写了一小本子生字，现在都忘得百事没有了。我只能完成工作任务。”敬孝同志为了说服他，便把几个同志和他自己几年来的学习笔记拿出来让大家看。以前笔记上的字有大有小，粗细不匀，行儿也歪；现在都整齐多了。接着又提出学习模范刘景英同志，来教大家向他学习。刘景英先是区公所的一个通信员，一字不识；但他见人就问，写不成强写，记不上强记，抄报纸，抄笔记，学习的不停工，四年工夫，现在居然能记上笔记了。但陈存祺还是说：“我只能完成工作任务，没时间学习。”这时大家就批评他了。都说：“你还识字，能看下书去，还不如小刘吗？主要是你不肯下苦心。”陈存祺皱着眉头，捏住脑盖躺了半天，最后跳起来说：“我还不如小刘吗？”他也下决心要学习了。敬孝同志为了巩固大家学习情绪，又把苏维埃机关人员应如何工作的文件念一节，大家更进一步得到启发。张维勇说：“过去不学习，也就是缺少为人民服务的精神。”杨子俊说：“这才知道学习是关系人民生死祸福的，非学习不可！”常景德说：“咱们不肯学习，也就是毛主席说的灰尘。我们要好好学习，经常洗脸，把灰尘洗掉。”经过这个讨论，大家学习信心与情绪提高了。接着便订出计划，学习一九三三年的两个文件和党章，另外按各人不同的程度定出不同的学习计划：常景德程度低，坚持一天认一个字，并学写话句；杨子俊程度稍高点，学习记笔记；陈秀芳程度更高一点，还要学习总结材料。张维勇能看书，也会写，实际工作经验少，学习分析问题，写稿，总结工作。郑景孝工作经验多些，学习看报，学习理论。陈存祺每天抄报，抄笔记，记生字。大家干的很带劲。
