Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Front, 3rd: Frontline reporters report on the liberation of Shenyang, stating: After the Northeast People's Liberation Army annihilated the enemy's main force, the Liao Yaoxiang Corps, in the area east of Dahushan in western Liaoning, it swiftly recovered the satellite strongholds surrounding Shenyang, including Xinmin, Tieling, Fushun, Benxi, Liaoyang, Anshan, and Haicheng. They pursued and cut off the enemy attempting to escape south from Shenyang. Our advance units captured the Dongling and Beiling airports northeast of Shenyang on October 29th. Subsequently, the main force arrived and launched a breakthrough in the Tiexi District at 4:00 AM on the 31st, attacking the enemy's final stronghold in Shenyang. Yesterday evening, the battle was completely resolved. Shenyang, the largest city in Northeast China with a population of 1.8 million, occupied by the Kuomintang for two years, six months, and twenty days, was liberated. The defending enemy's Northeast "Bandit Suppression" Headquarters, 8th Army Headquarters, Shenyang Garrison Headquarters, all three divisions of the 53rd Army (including its 116th Division and a large part of a regiment of the 130th Division, previously annihilated in Tieling and Xinmin), the Provisional 53rd Division of the New 1st Army, the 1st and 2nd Brigades of the Reorganized 207th Division, the Northeast "Bandit Suppression" Headquarters' directly subordinate Guard Regiment, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Brigades of the Cavalry Headquarters, the entire 7th Artillery Regiment, part of the 16th Regiment, the 11th Heavy Mortar Regiment, the Armored Corps, the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Tank Regiment, the 10th and 12th Engineer Regiments, the 6th and 9th Signal Regiments, the 6th Military Police Regiment, the 6th Supply Area Headquarters, the Northeast Garrison 1st and 2nd Regiments, the Shenyang Garrison 1st and 2nd Regiments, the Liaoning Security Brigade, and various miscellaneous units, as well as the reactionary exiled governments from various places, were all annihilated. Except for the bandit leaders Wei Lihuang and Du Yuming, and a few high-ranking Kuomintang officials who fled in panic by plane, none escaped. Countless war spoils were seized, and the results are still being tallied. Thus far, within the entire Northeast region, apart from a small number of enemy troops on the narrow beachheads of Yingkou and Jinxi, who are either being surrounded and annihilated (Yingkou) or preparing to flee (Jinxi, Huludao), all the rest have been cleared. The liberation of the nine provinces of Northeast China has filled the military and civilians with wild joy.
