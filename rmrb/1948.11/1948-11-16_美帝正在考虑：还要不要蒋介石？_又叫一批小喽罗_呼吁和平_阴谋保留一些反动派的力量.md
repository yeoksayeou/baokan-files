Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 14th. Is Chiang Kai-shek good? Or is it better not to have Chiang Kai-shek? The American reactionaries have obviously not made a final decision. The Americans are now supporting Chiang Kai-shek on the one hand and the anti-Chiang faction in Nanjing on the other, but neither side is supported firmly, because they are still watching the next step in the development of the situation. Among those in the Nanjing Kuomintang who hope to remove Chiang Kai-shek in order to preserve the existing strength of the reactionaries, some belong to Chiang Kai-shek's direct line who are seeking protective coloration, and others belong to anti-Chiang warlords who are trying to fish in troubled waters and replace him. They all maintain contact with the US State Department and the US Ambassador, John Leighton Stuart. Because Chiang Kai-shek is still unwilling to step down, their activities are not completely "legal," and those who do not belong to Chiang Kai-shek's direct line are subject to more restrictions. But as the Kuomintang's military situation further deteriorates, their activities will rise. The non-direct line Li Zongren, He Yingqin, and Bai Chongxi, and the direct line Song Ziwen, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, and Shao Lizi, may come out to advocate "peace" at some point. At present, this kind of activity is first carried out by some people whom Chiang Kai-shek calls "intellectuals." For example, a group of Nanjing professors, led by the special agent Liu Butong, published a so-called "Appeal for Peace" manifesto a few days ago. A little earlier than Liu Butong's manifesto, there was an article by the democratic traitor Zhang Shenfu published in the Shanghai Observation Weekly on October 23, entitled "Appeal for Peace." The article stated: "The national policy revealed by the ruling party today is to suppress the rebellion and suppress the bandits; it does not necessarily have to go through the route of large-scale military operations. But if there are other methods to quell the rebellion and pacify the bandits, that is, the national policy has been implemented and the goal has been achieved, why must we resort to military force, which only makes our people suffer? And this other method is to end the war in a democratic way and agree to restore peace. Striving for the initiative in military affairs is not as good as winning the initiative in peace, which will greatly bring people's hearts back." Zhang Shenfu here unreservedly exposed his identity as a "bandit suppression" staff member of the US State Department and its Nanjing colonial government. We do not know when Zhang Shenfu joined the US State Department system, but his words are indistinguishable from those of the imperialist John Leighton Stuart and the special agent Liu Butong. What people like Liu Butong and Zhang Shenfu who "appeal for peace" are most afraid of is that the people will quickly seize true peace. The closer the people get to finally eliminating the reactionaries and thus obtaining true peace throughout the country, the more frantically these people will inevitably appeal to preserve the reactionaries, the mortal enemies of peace, and they themselves call this "appealing for peace." Liu Butong has always been a special agent, of course, he will work hard to preserve the reactionaries. Zhang Shenfu, a person who usually pretends to be democratic, now does not hesitate to remove his disguise and openly act as a pawn to preserve the reactionaries, which proves that the reactionaries are about to breathe their last breath. From this, a lesson is drawn: people should be vigilant about the bad people hidden in the democratic camp.

　　美帝正在考虑：还要不要蒋介石？
    又叫一批小喽罗“呼吁和平”阴谋保留一些反动派的力量
    【新华社陕北十四日电】究竟要蒋介石好？还是不要蒋介石好？美国反动派显然还没有作出最后的决定。美国人现在一面支持着蒋介石，一面支持着南京的反蒋派，但是两面都不坚决，因为他们还要观望形势的下一步发展。南京国民党内希望去掉蒋介石以便保存反动派现有力量的人们中，一部分是属于寻求保护色的蒋介石嫡系，另一部分是属于企图混水摸鱼取而代之的反蒋军阀，他们都与美国国务院和美国大使司徒雷登保持联系。因为蒋介石目前还不肯下台，他们的活动还不完全“合法”，不属于蒋介石嫡系的人们还受着更多的限制。但在国民党军事形势进一步恶化时，他们的活动就会抬头。非嫡系的李宗仁、何应钦、白崇禧，和嫡系的宋子文、张群、张治中、邵力子等人，都可能在某种时机出来主张“和平”。现在这种活动是首先经过蒋介石所称为“知识分子”的一些人来进行。例如以特务分子刘不同为首的一部分南京教授，在几天前，曾经发表了一篇所谓“呼吁和平”的宣言。比刘不同们的宣言略早些日子，有十月二十三日出版的上海观察周刊所载民主叛徒张申府的“呼吁和平”一文。该文称：“今日执政方面所揭示的国策，乃是戡乱，乃是剿匪；并不必须出于大规模武力作战一个途径。但令别有方法，使乱得弭，使匪得平，即是国策已行，目的已达，又何必一定诉于武力，徒苦吾民？而这个别的方法，便是以民主的方式结束战事，协议恢复和平。在军事上争取主动，诚不如在和平上赢得主动，必大大地足以使人心来归。”张申府在这里毫不隐讳地暴露他作为美国国务院及其南京殖民政府的“剿匪”参谋人物的身份。张申府何时加入美国国务院的系统我们不明白，但他的说话则和帝国主义者司徒雷登及特务分子刘不同的说话使人们找不出任何的区别。刘不同张申府这类“呼吁和平”的人们所最害怕的，就是人民将要迅速夺取真正的和平。人民愈接近于最后消灭反动派从而获得全国范围内的真正的和平时，这类人物就必然愈加发狂地呼吁保存和平死敌的反动派，他们自己把这个叫做“呼吁和平”。刘不同从来就是特务，当然要努力保存反动派。张申府这类平素伪装民主的人物，现在也不惜除掉伪装，公然出来充当保存反动派的一名小卒，这就证明反动派已经到了快要断气的时候。从此引出教训，对于藏在民主阵营的坏人，是应当提起人们的警惕性的。
