　　Xinhua News Agency, North China, 10th: The Taiyue, Ji-Lu-Yu, and Beiyue District Party Committees have exposed serious right-leaning errors in the land reform rectification work. In Beiding Village (natural village), Yicheng County, Taiyue District, there are a total of 193 households with 807 people and 4,786 mu of cultivated land, averaging 4.93 mu of land per person. During the land reform, 24 households were struggled against, and 14 of them were wrongly struggled against. Among them, 3 households were swept out of their homes, and 11 households maintained their middle peasant lifestyle. This rectification adopted a method of mobilizing the masses from top to bottom to compensate the wrongly struggled households, "regardless of whether there are problems or not, all must be returned." The masses, especially the poor peasants, disagreed with this approach, but the leading cadres did not accept it. As a result, 32 middle peasant households returned 72.95 mu of land, one and a half livestock, four carts, 56 farm tools, and 13 pieces of clothing; 70 poor peasant households returned 240 mu of land, nine and a half livestock, two carts, 209 farm tools, and 41 pieces of clothing. In addition, 46.1 mu of public land was also allocated for compensation. After the compensation, eight turned-over poor peasant households were reduced to abject poverty; four new middle peasant households were reduced to poor peasants; and the land owned by five other peasant households was all below five mu. However, one landlord household, with two people, each possessed 10 mu of land, exceeding the village average by one time; nine rich peasant households, with 45 people, averaged 4.95 mu of land per person, but their output exceeded that of the poor peasants by half. Three rich peasant households were classified as middle peasants. When re-determining class status, the poor and hired peasants did not raise objections, and they were opposed to the wrongly struggled households. Some poor peasants had difficulties in their lives after returning things. The village had a stockpile of 20 shi of grain, 350,000 yuan, and one and a half livestock, but they were not distributed to them, so their emotions were very low. Wanghua Village (semi-old key village) in Liaoyang County, Ji-Lu-Yu, had 125 households, and 13 households were struggled against. Among them, two landlord households and two rich peasant households only took out part of their ill-gotten wealth. The middle peasants who were struggled against were generally not affected in their economic status, and their lives still exceeded those of the poor peasants. Party members and the masses believed that there was no need for compensation or resettlement, but the work team cadres adopted a "kick them away" approach and established a peasant representative conference to carry out compensation and resettlement work. Regarding the grafter Xu Jinzhong, the masses were unwilling to compensate him, but the work team cadres believed that "if he embezzled 150 jin, and was fined 200 jin when anti-embezzlement measures were taken, then he should be compensated 50 jin." They also held a "self-reporting conference" to mobilize the poor peasants to return the fruits of their labor. The poor peasant military dependent Zhang Yongcheng took out all the things he had been allocated and said, "I am still poor." The village cadres took out things, but the work team thought it was too little and forced the peasant association director Xu Chengbi to cry. Some of the struggled households themselves felt that this compensation was too excessive. The landlords and rich peasants were very happy and sang operas all the way home. When summarizing, the county party committee and the work team instead thought that the work was "successful." There were some villages in Liaoyang County with similar situations. In Zhuxian and Yanggu counties, the feudal forces still occupied a dominant position in some villages. After the rectification began, the landlords took the opportunity to demand the return of land and houses. Some cadres took the lead in returning part of the fruits of labor, and some returned everything. Some were changed to tenancy relations, with a 30/70, 40/60, or 50/50 split of grain. The leadership instead thought it was "voluntary on both sides" and tacitly approved its legality. The Sixth District Committee even proposed the slogan "Don't be afraid of being right when opposing the 'Left,'" and the Eighth District Committee proposed the slogan "Return all original items." When re-determining class status, some landlords were classified as rich peasants, and the landlords and rich peasants who had been missed were not investigated. In addition, Yutuo Village, Yi County, Beiyue District, recently held a mass meeting to discuss compensation work. The struggled households all attended, but the poor peasants were afraid of returning things and did not attend. The old cadres watched the spectacle. The meeting could not be held, and the struggled households beat up the village head. Similar situations have occurred in other areas recently. The leading organs are now paying attention to correcting these right-leaning errors in the process of rectifying "Leftist" deviations.

### 太岳、冀鲁豫、北岳区党委　纠正纠左中右倾错误

　　太岳、冀鲁豫、北岳区党委
  　纠正纠左中右倾错误
    【新华社华北十日电】太岳、冀鲁豫、北岳三区党委，揭发土地改革纠偏工作中某些右倾的严重错误。太岳区翼城县北丁村（自然村）共一百九十三户，八零七人，耕地四七八六亩，总平均每人土地四·九三亩。土改中被斗二十四户，误斗者占十四户。其中扫地出门者三户，仍保持中农生活者十一户。此次纠采取自上而下动员群众赔偿误斗户，“不管有无问题，一律全部退还”。群众特别是贫农不同意这种做法，但未被领导干部所接受。结果，三十二户中农退出土地七二·九五亩，牲口一头半，大车四辆，农具五十六件，衣服十三件；七十户贫农退出土地二四零亩，牲口九头半，大车两辆，农具二零九件，衣服四十一件。外加公地四六·一亩，亦拨为补偿之用。补偿后八户翻身贫农又降为赤贫；四户新中农降为贫农；另有五户农民所有土地均在五亩以下。而一户地主，两口人，每人占有土地十亩，超过全村平均数一倍；九户富农，四十五口人，每人平均占地四·九五亩，但产量超过贫农半倍。有三户富农划成了中农。改定成份时贫雇农不提意见，与误斗户对立。有些贫农退还东西后生活困难，村中积存果实尚有粮食二十石，款三十五万元，牲口一头半，却不分给他们，因此情绪甚为低落。冀鲁豫聊阳县王化村（半老重点村）一百二十五户，被斗十三户，其中两户地主及两户富农只拿出部分浮财，中农被斗者一般未影响其经济地位，生活仍超过贫农。党员及群众均认为不必补偿、安置，而工作组干部采取了“一脚踢开”的方针，另行成立农代会，进行补偿安置工作。对于贪污分子许金重，群众不愿补偿，工作组干部却认为“假如他贪污一百五十斤，反贪污时罚了二百斤，就要补他五十斤”。并召开“自报大会”，动员贫农退出果实。贫农军属张永成将分得的东西全部拿出来，说：“该穷还是穷”。村干部拿出东西，工作组嫌少，逼得农会主任许成壁哭了。有的被斗户本人也觉得这样补偿太过分。地主、富农很高兴，出门就一路唱戏。总结时县委及工作组反认为工作“成功”了。聊阳县还有一些村子情况与此类似。筑先、阳谷两县也有一些村庄封建势力仍占统治地位，纠偏开始后，地主乘机索回土地房屋，有的由干部领头退还一部分果实，有的一律退了。有的改为租佃关系，按三七、四六或对半分粮，领导上反认为“双方自愿”，默认其合法。六地委竟提出“反左就不怕右”，八地委提出“原物全部退还”等口号。改定成份时，有的将地主划成富农，对漏斗的地主富农则不追究。此外，北岳区易县鱼坨村最近召开群众会讨论补偿工作，被斗户都到了，贫农怕退东西都不到会，旧干部看笑话，会开不成，被斗户倒把村长打了一顿。其他地区近来亦有一些类似情形发生。领导机关现正注意纠正此类纠左中的右倾错误。
