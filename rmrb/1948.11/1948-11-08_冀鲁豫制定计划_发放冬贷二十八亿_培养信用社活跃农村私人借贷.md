　　[Ji-Lu-Yu Electric Message] The Ji-Lu-Yu District Branch of the North China Bank convened a meeting of branch managers last month, thoroughly discussed the new spirit of loaning in-kind with guaranteed principal, specifically studied the guiding principles for loan work, and clearly pointed out that loans must and can only be for the purpose of organizing mass production. Based on the specific conditions of each county, a winter loan plan was formulated. The conference determined that the total amount of loans for the entire district would be 2,803 million yuan (300 million yuan has already been allocated to various sub-districts) and 3,050,000 jin of wheat. In order to fully prepare funds and leverage the role of loans in supporting production, the meeting demanded that old loans be collected, totaling 2.7 billion yuan. In order to gradually develop private lending in rural areas, the meeting planned to cultivate and establish 21 rural credit cooperatives in the entire district within half a year. Bank loans will be issued through them, in order to more closely organize mass production and simultaneously strengthen and develop credit cooperatives. Regarding the issue of loan recipients, the meeting believed that there are two incorrect understandings and practices: one is focusing solely on whether loans can be recovered, without actively developing production; the other is a one-sided pro-poor peasant view, treating loans as charity relief, repeating the practice of comparing difficulties and lending to whoever is poorer. These viewpoints and practices are harmful to the development of production and must be corrected. In the future, loans must be made in strict accordance with the instructions of the North China Government, "All working people who are actively engaged in production have the right to enjoy loans." However, when determining recipients, attention should be paid to distinguishing between urgency and importance, primary and secondary considerations, and different categories. Those that are to be encouraged and rewarded can be lent to first or lent more to.

　　冀鲁豫制定计划
    发放冬贷二十八亿
  　培养信用社活跃农村私人借贷
    【冀鲁豫电】华北银行冀鲁豫区行上月召开分行经理会议，详细讨论了贷款实物保本的新精神，具体研究了贷款工作方针，明确指出：贷款必须而且只能是为了组织群众生产；并根据各县具体情况制订出今冬贷款计划。大会确定全区贷款总数为廿八亿零三千余万元（现已拨发各分区三亿元），麦子三零五万斤。为充分准备资金，发挥贷款扶植生产的作用，会议要求必须催收旧贷，计共廿七亿元。为逐渐开展农村私人借贷，会议计划在全区半年内培养与建立二十一个农村信用合作社。银行贷款，通过它们去发放，以便更密切地组织群众生产，同时壮大发展信用社。关于贷款的对象问题，会议认为有两种不正确的认识和作法：一种是单从贷款能否收回着眼，没从积极的发展生产出发。一种是片面的贫雇观点，把贷款当作恩赐救济，重复了比困难，谁穷就贷给谁的作法。这些观点和作法，都是对发展生产有害的，必须纠正。今后贷款，一定要认真按照华北政府指示去做，“一切积极从事生产的劳动人民，都有享受贷款的权利”。但在确定对象时，应注意分清缓急，主要与次要，分清种类，凡属于提倡奖励的就可先贷或多贷。
