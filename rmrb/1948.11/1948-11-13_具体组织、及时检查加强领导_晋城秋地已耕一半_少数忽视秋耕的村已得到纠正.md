[Taiyue Telegram] Jincheng, relying on specific organization, timely inspection, and correction of deviations, has plowed over half of the county's autumn land, with some individual villages having completed all autumn plowing. In terms of leadership, at the beginning of autumn plowing, the county first repeatedly publicized the importance of autumn plowing and mobilized cadres at all levels to strengthen leadership in order to complete the plan of plowing the land once over. Later, in the process of the movement's development, deviations were continuously discovered and corrected, difficulties were overcome, and the movement was pushed forward. For example, at the beginning of October, after discovering that leaders in various districts and villages were neglecting autumn plowing, in addition to immediately issuing telephone notifications for correction, a solemn instruction was issued, ordering cadres at all levels to vigorously correct the situation. Various districts also strengthened their leadership. For example, the Fourth District established a reporting system to understand the situation and discover problems in a timely manner. It organized autumn plowing inspection teams and sent them to various villages to promote the work on the ground. After the leadership was strengthened, the vast majority of the masses gradually recognized the benefits of autumn plowing and actively carried out autumn plowing. Therefore, by the end of October, 55% to 60% of the county's autumn land had been plowed. For example, in the Seventh District, out of 28 villages with 74,469 mu of autumn land, 38,064 mu had been plowed, accounting for 54%. In the Fourth District, out of 23 villages with 31,701 mu of autumn land, 17,728 mu had been plowed, accounting for 56%; villages such as Jiazhai, Kongzhuang, and Lizhai had already completed all plowing and were proceeding with manure accumulation and foundation building. However, after in-depth inspection, it was still discovered that individual cadres neglected autumn plowing or were limited to general appeals, without specific organizational leadership. For example, in Nanzhang Village, cadres did not have specific organizational leadership for autumn plowing, only making arrangements during the burden assessment, and now they do not know the actual situation of autumn plowing. In Liaozhe Village, there are still 200 mu of cotton fields that have not been plowed and are not planning to be plowed, but they falsely reported that they had been plowed. Furthermore, in Putou Village, on the second day that the deputy village chief mobilized all efforts for autumn plowing, the war support director and public security officer took livestock for transportation, taking Zhao Tingjun and six other families with them, leaving for ten days and delaying autumn plowing. Some of the masses are still engaged in transportation. For example, in Lijiawan Village, there are still seven families with livestock engaged in transportation. There are also Roujingguan and Daji Villages, etc. All have a few livestock engaged in transportation, but not plowing autumn land, but the leaders of each village have not timely persuaded and mobilized them to prioritize autumn plowing over transportation, thus affecting a portion of the autumn land that has not been plowed to this day. Efforts are now being made to correct this. For example, Putou's base point is using actual examples of good autumn plowing to persuade and mobilize, generally persuading cadres first, and then having the cadres persuade and mobilize the masses. For example, Chen Guang and seven other families had originally decided to go out for transportation, but after being persuaded, they suspended transportation and carried out autumn plowing. At the same time, the wages for livestock were appropriately increased, setting the wage for plowing one day (three mu) at two dou of black beans. In addition, an autumn plowing inspection team was organized, and the village chiefs and deputy village chiefs of each village also participated, going to each village to conduct on-site inspections and promotion.

　　具体组织、及时检查加强领导
  　晋城秋地已耕一半
    少数忽视秋耕的村已得到纠正
    【太岳电】晋城依靠具体组织、及时检查纠正偏向，全县秋地已耕过一半，并有个别村已全部秋耕完毕。该县领导上，在秋耕开始时，首先反复宣传，说明秋耕的重要，并动员各级干部，必须对秋耕加强领导，以完成普耕一遍的计划。后来，还在运动发展过程中，不断发现与纠正偏向，克服困难，推动运动前进。如十月初，发现各区村领导上忽视秋耕现象后，除立即用电话通知纠正外，又郑重发出指示，责成各级干部必须大力纠正。各区亦加强了领导。如四区定出汇报制度，以便及时了解情况，发现问题。组织秋耕检查小组，分到各村实地推动。在加强了领导之后，绝大部分群众逐渐认识了秋耕的好处，积极进行秋耕。因此，至十月底，全县秋地已耕了百分之五十五到百分之六十。如七区，二十八个村，秋地七万四千四百六十九亩，已耕三万八千零六十四亩，占百分之五十四。四区二十三个村，秋地三万一千七百零一亩，已耕一万七千七百廿八亩，占百分之五十六；并有贾寨、孔庄、李寨等村已全部耕完，正进行积肥、垒基。但经深入检查后，仍发现个别干部忽视秋耕，或限于一般号召，无具体组织领导。如南掌村，干部对秋耕工作没有具体组织领导，仅在评议负担时布置了一下，现在就不知秋耕实际情形。寥则村还有二百亩棉花地没耕，并已不准备耕，但在汇报时却假报告已耕完。又如铺头村的战勤主任、公安员，在副村长动员全力秋耕的第二天，两人赶上牲口去运输了，并带领了赵廷俊等六家，一出去就是十天，耽误了秋耕。也有些群众还在运输。如李家堰村，仍有七家牲口出去运输。还有肉井关大箕村等。均有少数牲口在运输，却不耕秋地，可是各村领导上均未及时说服动员其先秋耕后运输，因此影响到一部分秋地至今未耕。现正设法纠正。如铺头基点，正用秋耕好的实际例子说服动员，一般先说服干部，然后再由干部去说服动员群众。如陈光等七家，原已决定出外运输，经说服后，暂停运输，而进行秋耕。同时，适当提高了牲口工资，确定耕一天（三亩）工资二斗黑豆。此外，还组织了秋耕检查组，各村村长、副村长也参加，到各村都实地检查与推动。
