Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th—The Far East International Military Tribunal's trial of the 25 major Japanese war criminals, after repeated delays, finally issued its verdict this month. The Far East International Military Tribunal officially opened on May 3, 1946, to try 28 major Japanese war criminals and adjourned on April 16 this year, entering the drafting stage of the verdict. By the time the verdict was announced, two and a half years had passed. During this period, former Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka and former Navy Minister Osami Nagano died of illness, and the former Director of the East Asia Economic Bureau of the South Manchuria Railway, Shumei Okawa, went insane. Therefore, the actual number of war criminals included in the trial was 25. During the trial, due to American protection, connivance, and encouragement, the solemn Far East International Military Tribunal was reduced to a platform for war criminals such as Tojo to promote militarism. When questioned about the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor and the launch of the Pacific War, Tojo openly stated in court: "I am convinced and always believe that this was a war of self-defense and does not violate international law." (Reuters, Tokyo, December 22, 1947) Tojo said: "China should be responsible for the Sino-Japanese War." His American defense lawyer, Bluwett, repeatedly argued that "Japan's launch of the Pacific War was indeed out of self-defense!" Before the announcement of his verdict, Tojo even made a statement saying: "The Japanese people's morale will surely rise again." The chief prosecutor of the Far East International Military Tribunal, the American representative Keenan, tried to exonerate Emperor Hirohito of war crimes in court, believing that Hirohito had no intention of waging a war of aggression. The Kuomintang government completely followed the United States in the trial process. When Hideki Tojo was tried in July 1946, the Kuomintang reactionary government sent its Deputy Minister of National Defense, Qin Dechun, to testify, but he was instead questioned in court. Tojo's defense lawyer pressed hard, trying to prove the legitimacy of Japan's aggression against China. Qin Dechun dared not refute, stammered, and earned a burst of laughter from war criminals such as Tojo.
　　After the verdict was announced, Shang Zhen, the head of the Kuomintang reactionary government's delegation to Japan, expressed his satisfaction unconditionally. However, the Chinese people will not forget that during the trial of these major war criminals, many important war criminals, including the top planners of Japan's war economy, Ikeda Seihin, Kyogo Kiyoshi, Fujiwara Ginjiro, and Ogura Masatsune, the economic advisor to the puppet Nanjing Wang Jingwei government, Aikawa Yoshisuke, the financial magnate who invaded Northeast China, and Nakajima Chikuhei, the king of aircraft, were released by the United States without authorization. Another group of 20 important war criminals who have not yet been tried, including former Commander of the China Expeditionary Army Neji Okamura, former Commander of the South China Expeditionary Army Ando Kisaburo, former Commander of the North China Expeditionary Army Tada Shun, and former head of the Shanghai Japanese Naval Intelligence Agency Kodama Yoshio, and many other Chinese executioners, are currently being proposed by Keenan to be released or have their crimes reduced. There are still many war criminals, large and small, who are at large. We are absolutely dissatisfied with the outcome of this trial. As for the Kuomintang traitor government itself, it not only shelters war criminals and recognizes thieves as fathers but also reuses war criminals to participate in the counter-revolutionary civil war. The Kuomintang government has always treated Okamura Neji, the chief culprit of the invasion of China, as a distinguished guest. The trial of Okamura, which was recently held under pressure from Chinese public opinion, has yet to produce any results.

　　国民党卖国政府追随美帝庇护战犯
    【新华社陕北十九日电】远东国际军事法庭对于日本二十五名主要战犯的审讯，在几经拖延以后，始于本月发表了判决书。按远东国际军事法庭，自一九四六年五月三日起，正式开庭审讯日本二十八名主要战犯，至今年四月十六日休庭，进入起草判决书阶段。到此次发表判决书之时为止，历时二年半之久。其间因前外相松冈洋石、前海相永野修身病死，前满洲铁道会社东亚经济局理事长大川周明疯癫，故列入审讯的战犯实为二十五名。在审讯过程中，由于美国的包庇纵容与鼓励，庄严的远东国际军事法庭，沦为东条等战争祸首宣扬军国主义的讲台。当讯及日本偷袭珍珠港、发动太平洋战争时，东条在法庭上公开声称：“余确信亦始终认为此乃自卫战争，毫不违背国际公法。”（路透社东京一九四七年十二月二十二日电）东条说：“中国应对中日战争负责”。其美籍辩护律师布鲁威特一再诡辩“日本发动太平洋战争确系出于自卫”！此次东条在宣布其判决书前，犹发表谈话称：“日本之民气必能再起。”远东国际军事法庭首席检查官美国代表季楠，在法庭上力图为日皇裕仁开脱战罪，认为裕仁无意进行侵略战争。国民党政府在审判过程中完全追随美国。当一九四六年七月审讯土肥原时，国民党反动政府派出其国防部次长秦德纯作证，结果反而在法庭上受诘问。土肥原之辩护律师紧紧追问，力图证明日本侵略中国的合法性，秦德纯不敢驳斥，支吾其词，博得东条等战犯哄堂大笑。
    此次判决书发表后，国民党反动政府驻日代表团团长商震已无条件首表满意，但中国人民不会忘记，在审讯这批主要战犯期间，许多重要战犯，包括组织日本战争经济的最高策划者池田成彬、乡古洁、藤原银次郎以及伪南京汪精卫政府经济顾问小仓正恒，侵略我东北的军需财阀鲇川义介，与飞机大王中岛知久平等，由美国擅自释放。另批尚未审讯的二十名重要战犯，其中有前中国派遣军司令西峄寿造、前华南派遣军司令安藤纪三郎、前华北派遣军司令多田骏、前上海日海军特务机关长儿玉誉志夫等侵华刽子手多名，正由季楠提议释放或减轻罪行中。尚有许多大小战犯，更逍遥法外。对于这次审判的结果是绝对不满意的。至于国民党卖国政府本身，不仅庇护战犯，认贼作父，而且重用战犯来参加反革命内战。对于万恶不赦的侵华魁首冈村宁次，国民党政府一向待为上宾，最近因受中国人民舆论压迫而举行的对冈村的审判，至今毫无结果。
