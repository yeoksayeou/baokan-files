　　North China Government Agriculture Department Calls for Launching a Mountain Hunting Campaign

　　[Our Newspaper] Launching a mountain hunting campaign this winter and next spring is an important task to ensure crops suffer less damage next year, and it is also a good way to increase sideline income in winter. To this end, the Agriculture Department of the North China People's Government specially calls on all localities to pay attention to it, especially in mountainous areas, and to organize and lead the development of this movement with a certain amount of force.

　　In recent years, wild animals and birds have been particularly rampant. In mountainous areas, incidents of tigers and wolves eating people are often heard. In some areas, people do not even dare to go out alone. Domestic animals such as pigs, sheep, chickens, and even donkeys and cattle are often injured. According to incomplete statistics from the first, sixth, and eighth districts of Pingding this year, a total of 62 people were injured and 34 people were killed. A fox or badger often bites more than half an acre of corn and peanuts in one night, and each raccoon (squirrel) sparrow, etc., eats three to five liters of grain a year. If these figures are added together, the losses suffered in the entire North China region are very alarming.

　　In order to protect the safety of people and animals, develop production, reduce losses, and increase sideline income in mountainous areas, it is very timely to mobilize the masses to launch a mountain hunting campaign in areas with animal damage this winter and next spring. It can not only eliminate harm for the people, but also be a profitable winter production activity in mountainous areas. The Ministry of Agriculture proposes: When launching this movement, attention should be paid to solving the following problems: First, deeply lead and organize the masses, hold seminars, exchange experiences, exchange technologies, stipulate reward methods, improve confidence, and create a mass hunting movement. Second, it is necessary to specifically solve the difficulties in hunting, such as guns and gunpowder (allowing the masses to purchase gunpowder during the hunting period) and poisons (such as Bubu Duan Chang San, also known as nitric acid strynine, which is sold in Shijiazhuang public pharmacies), wolf traps, etc., so that the masses can obtain tools and fully display their hunting skills. Third, all hunting proceeds belong entirely to the hunters, and public-owned stores should purchase animal skins. If organized to hunt, profits should be democratically discussed and distributed according to labor and skills. Fourth, hunting can be combined with firewood collection, land consolidation, and levee construction to avoid focusing on one thing and losing sight of the other. Fifth, mobilize children and women to participate in capturing small animals such as pigeons, sparrows, raccoons, and mice. Sixth, overcome the contemptuous attitude towards hunters. Hunting can increase production and eliminate harm for the people, and should be rewarded more.

### 华北政府农业部号召　开展围山打猎运动

　　华北政府农业部号召
  　开展围山打猎运动
    【本报讯】今冬明春开展围山打猎运动，是保证明年庄稼少受损害的重要工作之一，也是一个增加冬季副业收入的好办法。为此，华北人民政府农业部特号召各地加以重视，尤其山岳地区，应以一定力量组织领导这一运动的开展。
    近年来野兽及山禽特别猖獗，山岳地区虎狼吃人，时有所闻，某些地区竟至单人不敢外出，猪羊鸡甚至驴牛等家畜被伤害者更不时发生。今年平定一、六、八区不完全统计，共咬伤六十二人，咬死三十四人。一只狐狸或獾往往一夜咬玉蜀黍花生半亩以上，每只貉＠（松鼠类）麻雀等，一年吃粮得三、五升。如将这些数字合计起来，全华北区所遭损失就很惊人了。
    为了保护人畜安全，发展生产，减免损失，增加山地副业收入，有兽害地区，于今冬明春发动群众开展围山打猎运动，是很适时的，既能为民除害，并且也是山地冬季一项有利的生产。农业部提出：开展这个运动时，要注意解决下列几个问题：一、深入领导，组织群众，召开座谈会，交流经验，交流技术，规定奖励办法，提高信心，造成群众性打猎运动。二、要具体解决打猎困难，如火枪火药（准许群众在打猎期间购买火药）及毒药（如八步断肠散，又名硝酸士地年，石家庄群众药房出售此药）、狼夹子等，使群众取得工具，充分施展打猎技术。三、打猎所得完全归猎者所有，公营商店要收买兽皮。如果组织起来捕打，应民主讨论按劳力技术分益。四、打猎可和打柴整地埝相结合，以免顾此失彼。五、发动儿童及妇女参加捕捉鸽子、麻雀、貉＠、老鼠等小动物。六、克服对猎人的轻视态度。打猎可增加生产，且为民除害、应多奖励。
