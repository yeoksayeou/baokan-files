    Unify Steps in the Economic Struggle Against the Enemy
    North China Foreign Trade Conference Decides to Strengthen Import and Export Management
    [Report from this newspaper] The former Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee, in accordance with the policy of protecting and developing production and supporting the war, convened a regional foreign trade conference in late July, hosted by the Joint Industry and Commerce Department. Attendees included directors of local import and export bureaus, managers of import and export banks and stores, and representatives from other relevant departments. Based on the general policy of developing production and supporting the war, the conference reviewed the shortcomings in past work, decided on the future direction and policies for the economic struggle against the enemy, and formulated draft management methods for foreign trade, foreign exchange management methods, and tariff schedules for import and export goods. These drafts have been submitted to the North China People's Government for approval and have been issued to various regions for trial implementation.
    The conference unanimously agreed that our foreign trade policy is to encourage the export of surplus products from the North China Liberated Areas, to encourage the import of materials needed for the war and necessities for developing industrial and agricultural production, to restrict the export of grain and cotton to aid the enemy, and to prohibit the import of luxury goods, non-essential goods, and foreign industrial products that would undermine our region's industrial production. The following specific provisions were made:
    1. The conference decided that all large quantities of surplus products produced in our region and goods that need to be exported quickly due to their seasonality (such as pears, dates, mountain products, medicinal materials, fish, mats, wool, etc.) must be vigorously organized for export and allowed to be exported with light taxes or tax exemptions. Furthermore, since our region maintains a relatively high exchange rate between Jichaopiao and Jiangbi to protect grain and cotton from smuggling, it is often unfavorable for the export of surplus products and makes it difficult to exchange for necessities. Therefore, when surplus products are not easy to export, special permission can be granted to exchange for some prohibited materials that do not undermine the industrial development of our region (such as white sugar, pigments, tea, etc.) to supply the consumption of the people in the cities, thereby regulating the people in areas with surplus production, which actually becomes a form of exchange rate subsidy.
    2. The conference unanimously advocated strengthening the management of grain and cotton exports, only allowing them to be exchanged for materials needed for the war and industrial and agricultural materials necessary for developing production (such as pesticides, waterwheel parts, etc.) and transportation tools (rubber-wheeled carts, rollers, boats, etc.), and not allowing them to be exchanged for other materials. When necessary, the government may authorize import and export stores to operate exclusively.
    3. The conference believed that it is necessary to encourage the import of industrial materials needed for the war that our region cannot produce or does not produce enough of, and to encourage the import of raw materials and transportation tools (including public and private) necessary for industrial and agricultural production that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihoods, in order to support the war and help the development of industrial, agricultural, and transportation undertakings. Therefore, the conference decided to exempt all of these materials from import taxes, allow them to be exchanged for grain and cotton, and prioritize foreign exchange supply from banks. In order to maintain stable market prices for these imported goods and take care of merchants' profits, public stores should appropriately buy and sell to regulate them. Local industry and commerce bureaus, import and export bureaus, and stores must organize merchants to purchase the above-mentioned materials and provide various conveniences in import and export trade management to the extent possible.
    4. The conference believed that mass daily necessities that we can partially manufacture or find substitutes for in our region, as well as industrial raw materials that are consumables (such as spices and paper for papermaking and cigarettes, etc.) and non-essential transportation tools (such as bicycle parts, etc.), should be subject to import taxes and prohibited from being exchanged for grain and cotton. However, foreign exchange may be supplied by banks, and they may be exchanged for export products other than grain and cotton. When the foreign exchange supply is insufficient, their import may be temporarily suspended. For the import of these daily necessities, tax revenue and other economic methods should be used to appropriately lower import profits so that they do not exceed the import profits of encouraged import materials, so that import and export merchants will not be overly attracted to operating these daily necessities due to their high import profits, and relax their operation of encouraged import materials.
    5. The conference believed that under any circumstances, we should resolutely prohibit the import of luxury goods and materials that would undermine our region's industrial production (such as cigarettes, alcohol, soap, matches, etc.). We resolutely oppose the erroneous idea of relying on foreign luxury goods and daily industrial products to prosper our region's market. Currently, responsible comrades in some border cities in the North China Liberated Area, in order to "prosper" the cities they lead, allow the import of foreign luxury goods and daily necessities, attempting to rely on these foreign goods to attract merchants and "prosper" the market. This idea is an erroneous colonial idea and is extremely harmful to the development of our region's agricultural and industrial production and must be resolutely overcome.
    6. The conference believed that it is necessary to strengthen foreign trade management, establish and strengthen management zones for foreign trade in border areas, organize the masses, and combine border area tax personnel with the masses to implement foreign trade management policies. In management, procedures should be simplified to the minimum necessary extent to protect the legitimate operations of legitimate merchants. For merchants who violate laws and regulations, the method of confiscation should not be adopted completely, and emphasis should be placed on education and transformation. However, those who repeatedly commit offenses and refuse to repent must be severely punished. The conference pointed out that since the industrial and commercial conference, some anti-smuggling personnel in the border areas, because they fear violating industrial and commercial policies, have been afraid to carry out strict import and export management, which is wrong. What we oppose is only overly cumbersome import and export procedures that hinder the legitimate operations of legitimate merchants, only the method of confiscation without education or distinction, and the phenomena of beating and scolding people that have repeatedly occurred in the border areas in violation of discipline. As for foreign trade, it must be strictly managed in accordance with policies and cannot be allowed to be free, otherwise, foreign goods will invade, undermining our region's agricultural and industrial production and causing our region to lose its economic independence and become a colony of the US-Chiang regime.
    7. The conference focused on discussing specific measures to encourage merchants in the Chiang-occupied areas to transfer funds to our region to engage in industrial and commercial operations, stipulating that all goods imported from the Chiang-occupied areas as operating capital transferred to our region for investment in industry shall be exempt from import taxes, and those invested in commerce shall be given appropriate reductions and exemptions.
    8. The conference decided that all public enterprises in our region shall not set up purchasing agencies in the border areas to engage in procurement, so as to avoid competing with each other and raising the prices of imported goods, giving import and export merchants engaged in speculation opportunities to exploit. It designated several public stores in the border areas as legitimate agencies for unified procurement of military supplies and for undertaking foreign procurement on behalf of public enterprises. It also decided to organize import and export committees in the border areas, with the participation of responsible comrades from import and export trade administrative agencies, import and export banks, and import and export stores, to unify the steps in the economic struggle against the enemy.

    统一对敌经济斗争步调
    华北对外贸易会议决加强出入口管理
    【本报讯】前晋冀鲁豫边区政府、晋察冀边区行政委员会，根据保护与发展生产，支援战争的方针，曾于七月下旬召开全区对外贸易会议，由联合工商厅主持，到会者有各地出入口局长，出入口银行，出入口商店经理，及其他有关部门代表。会议根据发展生产，支援战争的总方针，检讨了过去工作中的缺点，决定了今后对敌经济斗争方针与政策，制定了对外贸易管理办法，外汇管理办法，出入口货物税则税目税率等草案，已呈请华北人民政府批准，并先后令发各地试行。
    会议一致认为我们的对外贸易政策，是奖励华北解放区人民生产过剩品输出奖励战争所需要的器材与发展工农业生产的必需品输入，限制粮棉出口资敌，禁止奢侈品、非必需品及足以打击我区工业生产的外来工业品入口。并作了以下的具体规定：
    一、会议决定凡我区生产之大批过剩品，及带有季节性需要迅速出口的货物（如梨、枣、山货、药材、鱼、席、羊毛等），均须大力组织输出，准予轻税或免税出口。又由于我区为保护粮棉不致走私，冀钞对蒋币比价较高，往往不利于过剩品之输出，难以换回必需品，因此在过剩品不易出口时，可以特许换回一些对我区工业发展不起打击作用的禁入物资（如白糖、颜料、茶叶等），供给城市的人民消费，以此调剂生产过剩品地区的人民，实际成为贴汇的一种形式。
    二、会议一致主张对于粮棉出口加强管理，只许用以换回战争所需要的器材，及对发展生产有必要的工业材料、农业材料（如杀虫药剂水车零件等）与运输工具（胶轮大车、滚轴、船只等），不许用以换回其他物资，在必要时得由政府授权出入口商店专卖经营。
    三、会议认为必须奖励我区不能生产或生产不足的战争所需要的工业器材入口，奖励有利国民生计的工业（包括公营私营）农业生产必需的原料，运输工具入口，以支援战争，并帮助工业农业运输事业之发展。因此，会议决定对以上这些物资进口一律免税，准许用粮食、棉花交换，银行尽先供给外汇，公营商店为保持这些外来品市价平稳，及照顾商人利润，应适当吞吐，加以调剂。各地工商局、出入口局、商店都须组织商人进行关于上述物资的采购，在出入口贸易管理上在可能范围内尽量予以各种方便。
    四、会议认为，只要我区能够部分制造，及能找到代用品的群众日用品，以及属于消耗品的工业原料（如造纸烟用的香料、盘纸等），及不十分必需的交通工具（如自行车零件等），均采取征税入口方法，禁止用粮棉交换，但得由银行供汇，及用粮棉以外之其他出口品交换，供汇不足时，可以暂时停止其进口。对于这些日用品之进口，应以税收，及其他经济方法，适当压低进口利润，使之不超过奖励入口物资的进口利润，使出入口商人不致因这些日用品进口利润过高、群趋经营，而放松对奖励人口物资之经营。
    五、会议认为我们在任何条件下均应坚决禁止奢侈品及足以打击我区工业生产的物资（如纸烟、酒、肥皂、火柴等）入口。坚决反对依靠外来奢侈品及日用工业品繁荣我区市场的错误思想。现在华北解放区有些边沿城市的负责同志，为了“繁荣”自己所领导的城市，因而准许外来的奢侈品及日用品入口，企图依靠这些洋货来吸引商旅，“繁荣”市面，这种思想是一种错误的殖民地思想，是对发展我区农工业生产极端有害的思想，必须坚决的加以克服。
    六、会议认为必须加强对外贸易管理，建立与加强边沿地区对外贸易的管理地带，把群众组织起来，由边沿区税务人员与群众相结合，贯彻执行对外贸易管理政策。在管理中，要简化手续至最低必要程度，以保护正当商人的合法经营，对于违犯法令的商贩，不应完全采取没收的办法，应着重教育改造，但对屡犯不悛者，必须严加处分。会议指出自工商业会议以来，有些边沿区缉私人员，因为怕违犯工商业政策，不敢进行严格的出入口管理，这是不对的。我们反对的只是过于烦琐的出入口手续，以致妨碍正当商人的合法经营，只是不加教育不加区别的没收办法，和在边沿区曾经屡次发生过的打人骂人等违犯纪律的现象。至于对外贸易，必须根据政策严加管理，不能放任自由，否则就会使外货内侵，打击我区农工业生产，使我区在经济上失去独立性，成为美蒋的殖民地。
    七、会议着重讨论了奖励蒋占区商人资金转入我区从事工商业经营的具体办法，规定凡自蒋区输入货物作为转入我区的经营资本，投资于工业者，一律准予免税进口，投资于商业者酌予减免。
    八、会议决定凡我区一切公营企业，不得在边沿区自设采购机关，从事采购，以自相竞争，抬高进口品物价，给从事投机的出入口商人以可乘之隙。并指定了几个边沿区的公营商店作为统一采购军用物资与代办公营企业对外采购的合法机关。并决定在边境组织出入口委员会，由出入口贸易行政机关，出入口银行，出入口商店的负责同志参加，以统一对敌经济斗争的步调。
