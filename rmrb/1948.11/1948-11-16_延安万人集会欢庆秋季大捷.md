Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 14th—On the afternoon of November 7th, Yan'an held a mass rally of ten thousand people to warmly celebrate the victory of the People's Liberation Army in the Autumn Campaign and the 31st anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution. A column of tanks seized from Hu Zongnan's Kuomintang troops rumbled into the venue amidst a forest of red flags of the self-defense forces. Before the meeting, propaganda teams, yangko dance teams, and propaganda trucks were active on the streets of Yan'an all day long. The photo exhibition of the Political Department of the Northwest Joint Defense Command was crowded with men and women, city residents, and farmers from the surrounding villages. The presidium of the conference included Lin Boqu, He Long, and Zhao Shoushan. Speakers included Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the Border Region Government, Wang Weizhou, Deputy Commander of the Northwest Joint Defense Command, Li Buren, President of Yan'an University, and labor hero Yang Buhao. In his speech, Vice Chairman Yang called on everyone: "Learn from the Soviet people's spirit of hard struggle to defend world peace and democracy. Practice thrift, oppose extravagance and waste, unite the people, mobilize the masses, step up production, and strive to support the front, in order to liberate the Great Northwest and liberate all of China as soon as possible." In the evening, torches illuminated the entire venue, and colored flares slowly pierced the night sky. The enthusiastic cheers of the masses never ceased. The conference adopted a telegram of salute to Deputy Commander Peng on the front lines and all the commanders and fighters of the Northwest Field Army under his leadership.
