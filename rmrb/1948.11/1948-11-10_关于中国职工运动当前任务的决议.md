Resolution on the Current Tasks of the Chinese Workers' Movement
(Adopted by the Sixth National Labor Congress of China in August 1948)

Chapter One: The General Task of the Chinese Workers' Movement

Section 1: After the end of World War II, due to the United States imperialism replacing Japanese imperialism in carrying out tyrannical aggression against China, and the Kuomintang reactionary government implementing policies of civil war, dictatorship, and national betrayal, the people of the whole country have been plunged into the suffering of prolonged war; and the Chinese working class, except for those in the liberated areas who have already achieved democratic liberation, suffer the most severe oppression and pain. Under such circumstances, there is no other way out for the people of the whole country except to unite as one, resolutely overthrow the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, abolish the privileges of American imperialism in China, and thereby establish a new democratic regime of the united democratic classes. And if the Chinese working class does not make every effort to complete the current new democratic revolution against American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary government, it will not be able to improve its current miserable situation. Therefore, thoroughly overthrowing the rule of imperialism and its running dogs in China and establishing a new democratic people's republic is the general prerequisite for improving the current situation of the working class and other democratic classes, and is the supreme interest and supreme task of the working class and other democratic classes. In this great struggle, the Chinese working class should and must stand at the forefront and make itself the leader of the revolutionary people of all democratic classes. Only when the Chinese working class, in the most intense years of the current great struggle of the New Democratic Revolution, is completely united, fully demonstrates its revolutionary ability and spirit of self-sacrificing struggle, and thus makes a decisive contribution to this revolution, becoming a leader recognized by the people without any shame, can the working class maintain and consolidate the victory achieved in this revolution, and on the basis of this victory, hope and prepare for the more distant socialist future. And socialism is what can completely liberate the working class and all working people.

Section 2: Thanks to the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the heroic and skillful fighting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the selfless efforts and struggles of the people in the liberated areas and the broad masses of people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the Chinese people's revolutionary war has achieved extremely great victories. In two years of unprecedentedly large-scale and fierce warfare, the People's Liberation Army has annihilated more than 2.6 million of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary troops, and together with those liberated during the Anti-Japanese War, has liberated 168 million people. The People's Liberation Army has not only completely repelled the attack of the American-aided Kuomintang reactionary government on the liberated areas, but has also seized the initiative in the war and launched a powerful offensive against the Kuomintang-controlled areas, putting the enemy in a completely passive position and bringing the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government to the brink of collapse and disintegration. Under such circumstances, in order to preserve the rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionary government, to preserve the existing reactionary troops and territory, to gain a respite, to reorganize and replenish in order to facilitate further fighting, and to eliminate the People's Liberation Army and all democratic forces in China, American imperialists are preparing to instigate and organize a "peace" conspiracy to deceive the Chinese people, and are instigating certain reactionary military men, politicians, and so-called middle-of-the-road right-wing elements to prepare to launch a false peace movement, even at the cost of superficially removing Chiang Kai-shek to show their "sincerity" in seeking "peace". The primary task of the Chinese working class at present is to make every effort to closely unite the people of the whole country, resolutely support the People's Liberation Army in all aspects, and defeat American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionary government, throughout the country as quickly as possible, liberate all the people of China, and unify all of China. When American imperialists and their running dogs launch a false peace conspiracy, they must expose its deception to the people, defeat any false peace movement, and transform it into a movement to strive for genuine peace. This Labor Congress fully believes that, through the united efforts of the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country, and the continued heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, the realization of this great goal is not far away.

Section 3: After listening to the report of the representative of the Northeast Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, the Congress fully agrees with the general line and various policies adopted by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the current revolution. That is to say: the current stage of the revolution in China is a new democratic revolution led by the proletariat, participated in by the masses of the people, and opposing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. That is to say: the Chinese working class must first unite itself, and unite the peasants, independent laborers, freelance professionals, intellectuals, the national bourgeoisie, and enlightened gentry to establish a national united front against American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionary government, to establish a united front of all democratic classes, and to establish a people's democratic republic under the joint dictatorship of all democratic classes. That is to say: all democratic parties, people's organizations, and non-partisan democratic personages in China should convene, at an appropriate time, a revolutionary political consultative conference without the participation of reactionaries against American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionary government, to discuss and realize the convocation of a people's representative assembly, the organization of a democratic coalition government, the support of the People's Liberation War, the exposure of the enemy's peace conspiracy, the striving for the final victory of the war, and the striving for genuine and lasting peace for the people of the whole country. That is to say: to carry out land reform in the countryside, to equally distribute the land of the landlord class and feudal rich peasants, to confiscate bureaucratic capital in the cities, to protect national industry and commerce, and to implement the policy of developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital. The Congress calls on all workers and staff and workers' organizations throughout the country to actively participate in these revolutionary activities, revolutionary organizations, revolutionary regimes, and revolutionary policies proposed by the Communist Party, and to carry out work in accordance with the above-mentioned lines and propositions.

Chapter Two: On the Tasks of the Workers' Movement in the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas

Section 1: In order to achieve the above-mentioned goals, the workers' movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas should be more adept at contacting the masses, gathering strength, and expanding the ranks than at any time in the past, in order to welcome the arrival of the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, it should do everything possible to cautiously support and participate in the revolutionary movements of all the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and give possible obstacles to Chiang Kai-shek's arms manufacturing and military transportation.

Section 2: The living conditions of workers and staff and the oppression they suffer in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are more tragic and dark than at any time in the past, which forces workers and staff to constantly carry out struggles for survival. There should be more solid and more extensive unity, and a high degree of flexibility in tactics, in order to make this struggle more effective and to give their lives more outlets. This is what all revolutionary workers' organizations in the Kuomintang-controlled areas must pay attention to. Workers and staff in the Kuomintang-controlled areas must treat bureaucratic capitalists and national capitalists with different attitudes when carrying out this struggle. Because most of the national industry and commerce in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are also under the oppression, damage or restriction of imperialism and bureaucratic capital, workers and staff should first take the initiative to unite with these oppressed, damaged or restricted national capitalists, so that they and the working class can jointly oppose imperialism and bureaucratic capital and protect these national industries and commerce; then, they should ask these capitalists to appropriately improve the living conditions of workers and staff, in order to achieve the goal of benefiting both labor and capital. In the enterprises of bureaucratic capital and imperialism, especially American imperialist capital, this attitude should not be adopted, because bureaucratic capital and American imperialist capital are important tools for American imperialism and the Kuomintang to invade China and implement a policy of dictatorial civil war. The struggle of workers and staff in these enterprises to improve their lives is often linked to the struggle against the oppression of the rulers.

Section 3: As the industry and commerce of the liberated areas are developing and expanding, workers and staff and revolutionary workers' organizations in the Kuomintang-controlled areas should send appropriate skilled personnel to the liberated areas to participate in the construction of new-style industry and commerce. At the same time, workers and staff and revolutionary workers' organizations in the Kuomintang-controlled areas should pay close attention to protecting the machinery and equipment of all public and private enterprises, and oppose the destruction, relocation and dispersion of these machinery and equipment, because in the near future, all bureaucratic capital enterprises will be transferred to the hands of the people, and those originally owned by national industrialists and businessmen will continue to be owned by them. Especially when the People's Liberation Army arrives, workers and staff should do their best to protect all public and private enterprises and their factories, machinery and materials from destruction and damage, and should unite with people from all walks of life to monitor counter-revolutionaries and maintain social order, pending the establishment of a new order.

Section 4: When carrying out the above-mentioned activities, workers and staff in the Kuomintang-controlled areas should pay close attention to the appropriateness of the methods and methods, pay attention to protecting their own organizations and leaders, properly handle the relationship within the workers and staff, and strictly prevent the enemy's provocations and alienation.

Chapter Three: On the Tasks of the Workers' Movement in the Liberated Areas

Section 1: The workers' movement in the liberated areas is carried out under completely new conditions. Here, the working class has been liberated in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and has become the leading class of the state power. Here, there is no longer any bureaucratic capital, but there is new state-owned enterprise and cooperative enterprise capital, which belongs to all the people or some of the people, and also belongs to the working class; in these enterprises, there is no labor-capital antagonism, only public-private relations, and workers and staff are already the masters of industry. Here, the development of industry and agriculture is the material basis for directly strengthening the people's revolutionary war and improving the people's lives, especially the material basis for improving the lives of workers and staff. Here, there is still labor-capital antagonism in private enterprises, and workers and staff are still in an exploited position, but since workers and staff are in a leading position in politics, society, and the state power, it guarantees that workers and staff will not be oppressed and excessively exploited, and the existence and development of all private capital production undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy strengthen the entire liberated area economy, and are therefore beneficial to the working class. Due to all these new conditions in the liberated areas, the workers' movement in the liberated areas should be carried out under completely new guidelines and policies.

Section 2: First of all, the workers and staff in the liberated areas must be well organized and conduct studies well, raise their awareness, fully understand the current situation in China and all the above-mentioned new conditions in the liberated areas, in order to actively participate in the construction of the new democratic state power, army, economy, and culture in an organized and conscious manner, and select their own outstanding representatives to go to the various leading organs of the state, where they will unite with the representatives of the various democratic classes to carry out work, and adhere to the proletarian line and policies that represent the long-term interests of the entire people, and oppose various selfish and erroneous lines and policies.

Section 3: The task of developing industrial production in the liberated areas has been raised to an unprecedentedly important position, which is a particularly important task for the workers and staff in the liberated areas. Only by developing the industry of the liberated areas can we guarantee the final victory of the revolutionary war; can we meet the demands of the peasants after the land reform, especially the demands for agricultural technology improvement; and can we gradually improve the lives of workers and staff and other working people. The industry of the liberated areas, that is, the industry of new democracy, has unlimited development prospects. Because here there is a vast labor force that has been liberated, there are people's masses who cooperate closely, there is a commodity market that has been liberated, there are abundant resources, and the People's Liberation Army will liberate more cities, factories and machines, and gradually link the liberated areas into one piece. These important conditions for developing industry are increasing and strengthening day by day. What is especially important is that Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the general policy of economic construction of "developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital," which is guiding our industry to embark on a path of sound and large-scale development. Because the working class in the liberated areas not only occupies the position of masters politically and socially, but also occupies a leading position in the state power, especially in state-owned enterprises, the workers and staff in the liberated areas should assume the responsibility for developing industry in the position of the leading class, and should treat the labor they participate in with a new labor attitude of masters. In state-owned and public-owned enterprises, workers and staff have the right to participate in the management of the factory, and have the responsibility to actively work, complete and even exceed the production tasks required of them by the state. The position and responsibilities of workers and staff in cooperative enterprises are also roughly the same. Workers and staff in private enterprises also have the responsibility to complete the production plans of the capitalists, abide by the contracts signed by both labor and capital, and abide by the government's policy of protecting private industry and commerce, but at the same time have the right to demand that the capitalists implement the principle of benefiting both labor and capital and urge the capitalists to implement government laws and regulations. This is the basic principle and basic attitude that workers and staff in the liberated areas should adopt in developing industry. (⑴⑶)

Section 4: In order to enable the industry of the liberated areas to develop healthily, the following issues must be systematically resolved:

First: The planning of industry, which is an issue that needs to be raised and can be resolved today. Starting from the basic liberated areas, starting from state-owned and public-owned enterprises, through investigation and research, overall planning, so that the proportion between the ordnance industry, heavy industry, and light industry, the relationship between machine adjustment, site selection, power distribution, and technology improvement, the combination between raw material sources, finished product sales, and capital turnover, the cooperation between industry, agriculture, finance, trade, and transportation departments, and the coordination between various factories and enterprises should have appropriate plans, while taking into account the adjustment and leadership role of joint ventures and private enterprises. This local and partial planned economy can develop social productive forces, especially industrial productive forces, adapt to the needs of war today; and in the future, it can gain experience and create several preconditions for gradually realizing a national and comprehensive planned economy. It is necessary to eliminate the anarchist state of some public enterprises that lack planning and leadership, so that all public enterprises can carry out production under unified leadership and unified planning, and then implement planned leadership and adjustment for private and joint ventures.

Second: State-owned and public-owned enterprises must effectively improve their operation and management in order to achieve the goals of sufficient raw materials, low costs, good quality, large quantity, and wide sales. The solution to this task lies mainly in implementing the principle of enterprise and implementing democratic management. In order to implement the principle of enterprise, it is necessary to formulate a detailed production plan and implement an economic accounting system throughout the process from raw materials, production to sales; it is necessary to use business ability, labor technology, and devotion to duty as standards for employment, promote the examination system, ensure reasonable labor conditions, achieve reasonable organization, lean staff, and each perform their duties; it is necessary to implement a strict personal responsibility system, labor discipline and reward and punishment system, implement labor inspection and finished product inspection, so that everyone fulfills their responsibilities, merits and demerits are clearly distinguished, and rewards and punishments are appropriate. In order to implement democratic management, it is necessary to establish a unified leadership factory or enterprise management committee in each enterprise and factory, composed of the manager or factory director, engineers and other responsible persons in production, and representatives elected by the trade union at the workers' and staff congress (equivalent to the number of other committee members). The factory or enterprise management committee is the unified leading body in the factory or enterprise under the leadership of the higher-level state enterprise organ, with the manager or factory director as the chairman, discussing and deciding on various issues related to factory or enterprise management and production. Resolutions passed by a majority of the factory or enterprise management committee, if the manager or factory director believes that they conflict with the interests of the factory or enterprise or are inconsistent with the instructions of the higher-level, the manager or factory director has the right to suspend the execution and report to the higher-level for instructions; if the majority of the members of the factory management committee believe that the measures of the manager or factory director are not suitable or have objections to their report, they can also report their opinions to the higher-level at the same time and request instructions together, but before obtaining instructions from the higher-level, the decision of the manager or factory director should be implemented; if a minority of the members of the factory management committee have different opinions on the resolutions passed by the majority, they can also report their opinions to the higher-level. In case of urgent issues that cannot wait for the management committee to meet, the manager or factory director has the right to handle them, but the process must be reported to the management committee afterwards to request ratification. In addition, large factories with more than 500 people can also form a factory representative meeting composed of representatives of workers and staff (including apprentices) from various departments, under the leadership of the factory management committee, to convey and discuss factory decisions, production plans, and summaries of experience, in order to absorb more mass suggestions and criticisms. The production group meetings that have been commonly used in many factories should also play their due role. Only through these democratic forms and democratic methods under centralized leadership can we cultivate the management ability of workers and staff, promote internal criticism and self-criticism in the factory, overcome bureaucratic style, improve the sense of responsibility, labor enthusiasm and discipline of workers and staff, and develop correct labor competition and labor hero movement.

In private enterprises and factories, implementing the democratization of management, implementing the factory or enterprise management committee system and the factory workers and staff representative meeting system is of great benefit to ensuring labor-capital cooperation to improve production, ensuring that both labor and capital benefit, taking into account both public and private interests, and ensuring the implementation of national industrial and commercial policies and laws, and this system should be adopted after persuading the capitalists and with the consent of the capitalists. If a factory or enterprise management committee is organized in a private enterprise and factory, the factory director or manager has the final decision-making power. If the workers' representative believes that the decision of the factory director or manager is in conflict with the national economy and the people's livelihood or the principle of benefiting both labor and capital, the workers' representative may submit the different opinions to the government agency and the labor bureau for arbitration.

Third: At present, there are not enough technical cadres in industry, and there is an even greater lack of management cadres. There must be practical solutions to this issue of industrial backbone. Outstanding elements should be promoted from among the current cadres and gradually upgraded, and all current cadres should be helped to improve their intelligence. In places with more factories, vocational schools for workers and staff should be opened. On many work posts outside industry, there are many cadres who are from workers' background, or have received industrial specialized education, or have had industrial management experience, and a group should be recruited to participate in industrial management. Old management and technical personnel in newly liberated enterprises who are willing to continue serving must be employed as much as possible, except for proven saboteurs, and they must be well united and helped to change their old labor attitudes and management methods, especially their attitude towards workers. Industrial talents who voluntarily come to serve in the liberated areas should be welcomed and allowed to participate in appropriate work. In addition, ordinary intellectuals with a certain cultural level must also be recruited to factories to learn management work. It is also very necessary to open industrial specialized schools in places where students, teachers, and equipment are adequately available to train new industrial cadres.

Fourth: Due to the current unprecedented war environment, peasants in the liberated areas are sending troops, food, and war support in large quantities, and public and educational personnel are adhering to hard and unremitting work. Workers and staff in the liberated areas should endure hardship and do more work. On issues such as working hours, wages, labor protection, and welfare undertakings, they should consciously avoid excessive demands beyond what is permitted by wartime economic conditions. Regarding working hours, we advocate that factory workers generally implement an eight-hour to ten-hour system. With the approval of the local government, it may be extended or shortened for special enterprises or special circumstances. However, except for urgent war needs, the daily working hours, including processing, shall not exceed twelve hours at most. Processing shall not exceed four consecutive days, and shall not exceed forty-eight hours in the whole month. The working hours of agricultural workers, handicraft workers, and shop assistants may be followed according to custom.

Fifth: Regarding wage regulations, it must be guaranteed that any ordinary worker and staff has a minimum standard of living, that is, the minimum wage of the worker and staff, including themselves, must be enough to maintain the lives of two people; at the same time, it must be guaranteed that the labor enthusiasm and technical progress of workers and staff, and a graded wage system and a time-based and piece-rate wage system should be adopted. However, prices will inevitably fluctuate during the war, and in order to guarantee the minimum standard of living for workers and staff, the minimum wage cannot but be increased due to high prices, while the graded wages cannot be increased in proportion due to the limitations of wartime economic conditions; therefore, when stipulating wartime wages, it is necessary to take into account the relationship between these two and appropriately narrow the distance between the levels of the graded wages. Based on this principle, we advocate adjusting the wages of workers and staff according to the following regulations:

First: The wages of factory workers should adopt a cross-progressive grading system. Within this system, grades are determined according to the division of labor and technical level of workers and staff in the production process. The number of grades is not limited to three, and there should be more levels. Wage differences should still be retained within the same level. When evaluating wages, management and technical personnel should be assessed according to their responsibilities, abilities, and academic experience; craftsmen should be assessed according to their skills; skilled workers should be assessed according to their level of skill; and simple manual laborers should be assessed according to their degree of labor; at the same time, their seniority should be taken into account. The local governments of each liberated area should formulate relatively unified wage standards for the same type of enterprise with the consent of the trade union, but the same wage standard should not be stipulated for different enterprises. Each factory should then evaluate the specific wages of each worker and staff based on the wage standards promulgated by the government (a wage evaluation committee may be organized under the factory or enterprise management committee). The treatment of apprentices should not be included in the wage system, and apprentices should not participate in wage evaluation. After the reasonable wage system is implemented, those workers and staff who have special skills and need special treatment must be approved by the higher-level management agency. The excessively high or low deviations that exist in the current wage system are essentially a kind of egalitarianism. The occurrence of egalitarianism is influenced by the supply system and other erroneous ideas. The essence of egalitarianism lies in not understanding the necessity and importance of the above-mentioned wage principles and grading system, and more or less taking the number of people supported, the quality of life, family background, political enthusiasm, workers being higher than staff, apprentices being treated as ordinary workers, unskilled workers being treated as apprentices, etc., as the basis for evaluating wages, and arranging various wage levels into a single ladder that is non-cross-progressive, with few grades, and a very small distance between the highest and lowest, and even stipulating the same wage standard for various different enterprises. This egalitarianism seriously hinders the production enthusiasm of workers and staff, especially the enthusiasm to work hard to improve skills, and must be corrected quickly.

Second: The form of wages, whether time-based or piece-rate and its application, should be determined according to the specific circumstances of labor. The piece-rate system has a stimulating effect on production and should be promoted; but when there is no accurate grasp of finished product standards and finished product inspection, it should not be adopted rashly, and at the same time, waste of raw materials, damage to tools, and excessive labor that damages health should be prevented.

Third: In places where price fluctuations are too large and wage adjustments are difficult, the method of providing living allowances for workers and staff can also be used to adjust this difficulty. Although living allowances should also be divided into several levels, the difference between them should not be too large.

Fourth: Wage calculation should be based on several essential commodities as the basis for wage calculation (such as "＠" in North China and "Fen" in Northeast China), and a mixed form of payment in currency and in kind should be adopted. In order to further guarantee the actual wages of workers and staff, a new system of in-kind rationing should be adopted. This can be tried out in state-owned and public-owned factories, and after gaining experience, it can be promoted.

Fifth: The wage system of agricultural workers, handicraft workers, and shop assistants should follow their customs, but it should be based on essential commodities, and the actual wage should be guaranteed to be consistent with the nominal wage at the time of payment.

Sixth: State-owned and public-owned factories can also adopt a regular bonus method in addition to wages, which shall be stipulated or approved by the government. The habits of profit-sharing, gifts, and other rewards in workshops, shops, and private enterprises, which are beneficial to improving the labor enthusiasm and technical progress of workers and staff, must be preserved and popularized to all workers and staff.

Sixth: Regarding female workers, young workers, child laborers, and apprentices, the following regulations shall be implemented:

First: Male, female, young, and child workers shall receive equal pay for equal work.

Second: Female workers shall have a total of forty-five days of rest before and after childbirth; those with a miscarriage within three months shall have a total of fifteen days of rest, and those with a miscarriage after three months shall have a total of thirty days of rest, and wages shall be paid as usual.

Third: The industries in which child labor and female labor are prohibited, and the labor in which female and child labor are prohibited from working at night, shall be determined by the local governments of each liberated area by law. Labor that hinders physical development shall not employ child labor under the age of fourteen.

Fourth: The maximum learning period for apprentices shall not exceed three years. The treatment of apprentices shall be gradually increased according to their progress, with a minimum of enough to eat and a maximum of enough to eat and wear and a considerable allowance. The relationship between master and apprentice shall strictly observe the principle of respecting the teacher and loving the apprentice; apprentices must study diligently, work hard to produce, and masters must not abuse apprentices, and must especially teach skills wholeheartedly.

Seventh: Regarding labor protection and worker and staff welfare undertakings, because there is no foundation in China and it is in a time of war, we demand that it is difficult to handle a national systematic social insurance, and it should be handled according to the following points for the time being:

First: Improve factory health equipment and safety equipment as much as possible, and the government will send people to inspect regularly.

Second: Medical treatment, allowances, and compensation for injuries, illnesses, old age, and disability shall be handled by the factory for the time being, or jointly by the factory and the trade union. The methods shall be stipulated or approved by the government and supervised. In cities where factories are concentrated or where conditions are available, labor social insurance can be established.

Third: Worker and staff welfare undertakings (culture, education, cooperation, and relief for the poor, etc.) shall be handled jointly or separately by the factory and the trade union.

Fourth: The above-mentioned methods shall be applied to factory workers and staff. For other non-factory workers and staff labor protection and welfare undertakings, the trade union shall refer to the inherent habits and agree with the owners.

Fifth: Unemployment relief is mainly to help employment and organize production, and the government is responsible for handling it.

Eighth: The labor competition and labor hero movement in state-owned and public-owned enterprises have played a positive role in developing production, and this movement should continue to be advocated in the future, and be given correct leadership, so that it becomes utilitarianism aimed at reducing costs, improving production quality, and increasing production quantity, and becomes collective heroism that learns from each other, helps the minority, and motivates the majority; and the tendencies of crude and shoddy formalism and individual championshipism that are divorced from the masses must be resolutely corrected. In private factories and enterprises that have adopted the factory or enterprise management committee and worker and staff representative meeting system, labor competition and labor hero movement can also be promoted.

Ninth: Labor contracts and labor disputes should be handled according to the following points:

First: Labor must have a contract, and collective contracts should be used as much as possible in order to facilitate the fulfillment of both parties. Collective contracts should include the contents of labor conditions, employment, dismissal and reward and punishment of workers and staff, labor protection and worker and staff welfare, and the main points of factory regulations.

Second: The methods for handling labor disputes are negotiation, mediation, and arbitration. Arbitration is the final procedure, and appeals can be made to the court if one is dissatisfied with the arbitration.

Third: The local governments of each liberated area must promulgate collective contract regulations and methods for handling labor disputes, and must establish departments in charge of labor-related issues.

Section 5: The task of the trade union work in the liberated areas is to unite all workers and staff, actively work, abide by discipline, protect the daily interests of workers and staff, and educate workers and staff to improve their cultural level, especially to improve their technical ability and professional level under the general policy of developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital. In state-owned, public-owned, and joint venture enterprises, it should exert management ability; in private enterprises, it should realize a supervisory role; and in individual labor, it should promote technological improvement and production cooperation. Senior trade union organs have the responsibility to assist the government's labor legislation, and take concrete measures to ensure the reasonable implementation of the various provisions in the previous section. All male and female workers and staff who have legally obtained worker and staff status have the right to join the trade union; but the recruitment of members must be based on the principle of voluntariness. The trade union not only serves its members, but also serves non-members in the same way, and absorbs them to participate in activities, so that it can actually represent all workers and staff, and strive for all workers and staff to join the trade union. There must be a full democratic life within the trade union that can truly concentrate the opinions of the masses, there must be regular work that can truly solve the needs of the masses, and the bureaucratic style and formalistic style in the current trade union work must be thoroughly rectified, so that the trade union becomes a real organization of the workers and staff themselves.

Chapter Four: On the Restoration of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

In order to guarantee the implementation of this resolution, to guarantee that the Chinese working class can fully play its due role as a vanguard everywhere in the current great revolution, it is necessary to establish a unified national organization of the Chinese working class, so that it can constantly guide the actions of workers and staff masses in various places in the rapidly developing revolutionary movement. To this end, the Congress decided to restore the All-China Federation of Trade Unions of the First Great Revolution, and instructed the new executive committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to: continue the revolutionary traditions of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions during the First Great Revolution, and under the current new period and new conditions, quickly organize the workers and staff masses of the whole country, and unite with all democratic parties, people's organizations, and ethnic minorities of the whole country, to fight to the end to quickly overthrow the rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionary government in China, and to establish a unified new democratic people's republic.

　　关于中国职工运动当前任务的决议
    （一九四八年八月中国第六次全国劳动大会通过）
    第一章：中国职工运动的总任务
    第一节：在第二次世界大战结束以后，由于美国帝国主义代替日本帝国主义对中国实行横暴侵略，和国民党反动政府实行内战、独裁与卖国的政策，已经把全国人民陷入长期战争的痛苦之中；而中国的工人阶级，除开在解放区者业已得到民主解放以外，其所受的压迫和痛苦，则又最为严重。在这种情形下，全国人民，除开团结一致，坚决推翻国民党的反动统治，取消美国帝国主义在中国的特权，并从而建立各民主阶级联合的新民主主义的政权而外，就不能有任何其他的出路。而中国的工人阶级，如果不尽一切努力去完成现在反对美帝和国民党反动政府的新民主主义的革命，就不能使它自己目前所处的悲惨状况有所改善。因此，彻底推翻帝国主义及其走狗在中国的统治，建立新民主主义的人民共和国，乃是改善工人阶级及其他民主阶级人民目前状况的总前提，乃是工人阶级及其他民主阶级人民当前的最高利益与最高任务。在这个伟大斗争中，中国的工人阶级应该而且必须站在最前列，并使自己成为各民主阶级人民革命的领导者，只有中国的工人阶级在目前新民主主义革命的伟大斗争最紧张的年头，自己完全团结一致，充分表现了自己的革命能力和自我牺牲的奋斗精神，因而对于这个革命给以决定的贡献，成为人民公认的决无愧色的领袖时，工人阶级才能保持和巩固在这个革命中所取得的胜利，并在这种胜利的基础上去希望和准备较远的社会主义的前途。而社会主义则是能够彻底解放工人阶级和一切劳动人民的。
    第二节：由于中国共产党和毛泽东同志英明而正确的领导，由于中国人民解放军的英勇善战，由于解放区全体人民及国民党统治区广大人民群众不顾牺牲的努力和奋斗，已经使中国人民的革命战争取得了极其伟大的胜利。人民解放军在两年空前规模和空前激烈的战争中，已经消灭蒋介石的反动军队二百六十余万，连同在抗日时期被解放者在内共解放了一万万六千八百万人民。人民解放军不独是完全打退了美国援助的国民党反动政府向解放区的进攻，而且掌握了战争的主动权，向国民党统治区举行了强大的进攻，使敌人完全处于被动，使国民党反动政府的统治走到了摇摇欲坠和土崩瓦解的边缘。在这种形势下，为着保存美国帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动政府在中国的统治，为着保存现有的反动军队及地盘，获得喘息时间，休整补充，以利再战，并消灭人民解放军及中国一切民主力量之目的，美国帝国主义者正在准备策动和组织一个欺骗中国人民的“和平”阴谋，策动某些反动的军人、政客以及所谓中间派的右翼分子准备发动虚伪的和平运动，甚至不惜在表面上去掉蒋介石，以表示他们求“和平”中的“诚意”。目前中国工人阶级的首要任务，就是要尽一切的努力，紧密地团结全国人民，在各方面坚决的支援人民解放军，尽可能迅速地在全国范围内战胜美国帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动政府，解放全中国的人民，统一全中国。当着美帝国主义者及其走狗们发动虚伪的和平阴谋时，必须向人民揭露其欺骗性，击破任何假和平运动，将其转变为争取真和平的运动。本届劳动大会完全相信：经过中国工人阶级与全国人民团结一致的努力和人民解放军的继续奋战，这一个伟大目标的实现，已经是不很远了。
    第三节：大会在听了中共东北中央局代表报告之后，完全同意中共中央在目前革命中所采取的总路线和各种政策。这就是说：中国目前阶段的革命，是无产阶级领导的、人民大众的、反对帝国主义封建主义和官僚资本主义的、新民主主义的革命。这就是说：中国工人阶级必须首先团结自己，并团结农民、独立劳动者、自由职业者、知识分子、自由资产阶级及开明士绅，建立反对美国帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动政府的民族统一战线，建立所有各民主阶级联合战线，建立所有各民主阶级联合专政的人民民主共和国。这就是说：中国各民主党派、各人民团体及无党派的民主人士，应在适当时机召开没有反动派参加的反对美国帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动政府的革命的政治协商会议，讨论并实现召集人民代表大会，组织民主联合政府，支援人民解放战争，揭破敌人和平阴谋，争取战争的最后胜利，争取全国人民的真正的永久的和平。这就是说：在农村中实行土地改革，平分地主阶级与封建性富农的土地，在城市中没收官僚资本，保护民族工商业，并实行发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利的政策。大会号召全国一切职工及职工团体积极参加共产党所提议的这些革命活动、革命组织、革命政权和革命政策，并遵照上述路线和主张去进行工作。
    第二章：关于国民党统治区职工运动的任务
    第一节：为了实现上述目的，在国民党统治区的职工运动，应比以往任何时期都要更加善于联系群众，聚积力量，扩大队伍，以便迎接人民解放军的到来。同时，应尽一切可能，谨慎地支援和参加国民党统治区一切人民群众的革命运动，对蒋介石的军火制造与军事运输，给以可能的阻碍。
    第二节：国民党统治区职工们的生活状况及其所受压迫，比以往任何时期都更加悲惨和黑暗，这就逼得职工们不能不经常进行救死求生的斗争。应该有更加坚固和更加广泛的团结，并在策略上有高度的灵活性，才能使这种斗争获得更多的效果，使自己的生活得到更多一点出路。这是国民党统治区一切革命职工组织所必须讲求的。国民党统治区职工们在进行这种斗争时必须用不同的态度对待官僚资本家与民族资本家。因为国民党统治区的民族工商业，大多数也是处于帝国主义与官僚资本的压迫、损害或限制的情况之下，职工们首先应该主动地去联合这些受压迫、损害或限制的民族资本家，使她们和工人阶级一道共同反对帝国主义与官僚资本，保护这些民族工商业；然后，要求这些资本家适当地改善职工生活待遇，以达到劳资两利的目的。而在官僚资本及帝国主义特别是美帝国主义资本的企业中，则不应采取这种态度，因为官僚资本与美帝国主义资本，就是美帝及国民党赖以侵略中国和实行独裁内战政策的重要工具。职工们在这些企业中为改善自己生活的斗争常常和反抗统治者压迫的斗争联系起来。
    第三节：由于解放区的工商业正在发展和扩大中，国民党统治区的职工们和革命的职工团体应该派遣适当的熟练人员到解放区来参加新式工商业的建设。同时，国民党统治区职工们和革命职工团体应该十分注意保护一切公私企业的机器和设备，反对破坏、迁移和分散这些机器与设备，因为在不久的将来，一切官僚资本的企业都要转入人民手中，而原属民族工商业家所有者，则将继续为他们所有。特别在人民解放军到来时，职工们应当尽力保护一切公私企业及其工厂、机器和物资不受破坏和损毁，并应联合各界人民，监视反革命分子，维持社会秩序，以待新的秩序之建立。
    第四节：国民党统治区职工们在进行上述各种活动时，应十分注意方式和方法的适当，注意保护自己的团体和领袖，适当处理职工内部的关系，严防敌人的挑拨与离间。
    第三章：关于解放区职工运动的任务
    第一节：在解放区的职工运动，则是在一种完全新的条件之下进行。在这里，工人阶级已经在反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的斗争中，获得了解放，并已成为国家政权的领导阶级。在这里，已经没有官僚资本，但有新的国家企业与合作社企业的资本，这些企业是属于全体人民或部分人民所有，也是属于工人阶级所有；在这些企业中，没有劳资对抗，只有公私关系，职工们已经是工业的主人。在这里，工业和农业的发展，是直接加强人民革命战争与改善人民生活的物质基础，首先是改善职工生活的物质基础。在这里，私人企业中仍然有劳资对抗，职工们仍然处于被剥削地位，但职工们既是在政治上、社会上和国家政权中属于领导的主人的地位，就保障了职工们可以不致受到压迫和过分剥削，而一切有益于国民生计的私人资本生产事业的存在和发展，就加强了整个解放区的经济，因而也就有益于工人阶级。由于解放区这一切新的条件，所以解放区的职工运动，就应该在完全新的方针和政策之下来进行。
    第二节：首先，解放区的职工们必须很好地组织起来，并很好地进行学习，提高自己的觉悟，完全理解中国目前的形势及解放区上述一切新的条件，以便很有组织地并自觉地去积极参加新民主主义的国家政权、军队、经济、文化各方面的建设工作，并选派自己优秀的代表到国家的各种领导机关去，在这些机关中和各民主阶级的代表联合一致进行工作，并坚持无产阶级的、代表全体人民长远利益的方针和政策，反对各种自私自利的错误的方针和政策。
    第三节：发展解放区工业生产的任务，已被提到空前重要的地位，这是解放区职工们特别重要的任务。必须发展解放区的工业，才能保证革命战争的最后胜利；才能满足土地改革后农民的要求，特别是农业技术改进的要求；才能逐渐改善职工及其他劳动人民的生活。解放区工业，亦即新民主主义的工业，它的发展前途是无限的。因为这里有被解放了的广大的劳动力，有通力合作的人民大众，有解放了的商品市场，有丰富的资源，而人民解放军又将要解放更多的城市、工厂和机器，并逐步地将各解放区联成一片。这些发展工业的重要条件，都在逐日增多和增强。尤其重要的，是毛泽东同志提出了“发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利”的经济建设的总方针，这个方针正指引着我们的工业日益走上健全和广大发展的道路。由于解放区的工人阶级不但在政治上社会上居于主人地位，而且在国家政权中，首先在国家企业中，是居于领导地位，因此，解放区职工们就应当以领导阶级地位担负起发展工业的责任，就应当以主人翁的新的劳动态度对待自己所参加的劳动。在国营和公营企业中，职工既有权利参加工厂的管理，便有责任积极劳动，完成以至超过国家所要求于他们的生产任务。合作社企业中的职工地位和责任，也大体与这相同。在私人企业中的职工亦有责任完成资方的生产计划，遵守劳资双方所订立的契约，遵守政府保护私人工商业的政策，但同时有权利要求资方实行劳资两利原则，督促资方执行政府法令。这就是解放区的职工们在发展工业中所应采取的基本方针和基本态度。（⑴⑶）
    第四节：为使解放区的工业能够健全的发展，以下各项问题必须系统地加以解决：
    第一项：关于工业的计划性，这是今天需要提出并且可能解决的问题。首先从基本解放区做起，从国营、公营企业做起，经过调查研究，通盘筹划，使军火工业、重工业、轻工业之间的比重，机器调剂、厂址选择、动力分配、技术提高之间的关系，原料来源、成品推销、资金周转之间的结合，工业、农业、金融、贸易、交通各部门之间的合作，各工厂、企业之间的配合，都应有适当的计划，同时照顾到对合营、私营企业的调剂作用与领导作用。这种地方性和局部性的计划经济，在今天，能够发展社会生产力，特别是工业生产力，适应战争需要；对将来，则能够为逐步实现的全国性和全面性的计划经济取得经验和创造若干前提条件。必须肃清公营企业中某些缺乏计划、缺乏领导的无政府状态，使一切公营企业都能在统一领导统一计划之下进行生产，然后才能对私营与合营的企业实行有计划的领导与调剂。
    第二项：国营、公营企业必须切实改善经营和管理工作，才能达到原料足、成本低、质量好、数量多、销路广的目的。这个任务的解决，主要在于贯彻企业化原则和实行管理民主化。为了贯彻企业化原则就要制定周密的生产计划，实行从原料、生产到推销的全过程中的经济核算制度；就要以经营能力、劳动技术及尽忠职责为用人标准，推行考工制度，保证合理的劳动条件，做到机构合理，职工精干，各称其职；就要实行严格的个人负责制度，劳动纪律与赏罚制度，实行劳动检查与成品检验，做到人尽其责，功过分明，赏罚适当。为了实行管理民主化，需要在各企业各工厂中建立统一领导的工厂或企业管理委员会，由经理或厂长、工程师及生产中其他负责人和工会在工人职员大会上所选出的代表（相当于其他委员的数量）组成之。工厂或企业管理委员会在上级国家企业机关领导之下为工厂或企业中的统一领导机关，由经理或厂长任主席，讨论并决定有关工厂成企业管理和生产中的各种问题。在工厂或企业管理委员会多数通过的决议，如经理或厂长认为与该厂或该企业利益抵触或与上级指示不合时，经理或厂长有停止执行之权，并报告上级，请求指示；如工厂管理委员会多数委员认为经理或厂长的这种措施不适合或对其报告有异议时，亦可将自己的意见同时报告上级，一并请求指示，但在未得上级指示前，应执行经理或厂长的决定；如工厂管理委员会少数委员对多数通过的决议有不同意见时，亦可将自己的意见报告上级。在有紧急问题不及等待管理委员会开会时，经理或厂长有权处理之，但事后须将经过报告管理委员会，请求追认。此外在五百人以上的大工厂还可由各部门职工（包括学徒）代表组成工厂代表会议，在工厂管理委员会领导之下，传达和讨论工厂决定、生产计划与经验的总结，以便更多地吸收群众建议与批评。现在业已在许多工厂中通行的生产小组会议，亦应发挥其应有作用。只有经过这些集中领导下的民主形式和民主方法，才能培养职工管理能力，发扬厂内批评与自我批评，克服官僚主义作风，提高职工的责任感、劳动积极性与纪律自觉性，并发展正确的劳动竞赛和劳动英雄运动。
    在私人企业和工厂中，实行管理的民主化，实行工厂或企业管理委员会制与工厂职工代表会议制，对于保证劳资协力提高生产，保证劳资两利，公私兼顾及保证国家工商业政策和法令的执行，都有极大好处，应说服资本家并在资本家同意之下采用这种制度。私人企业和工厂中如组织工厂或企业管理委员会，厂长或经理有最后决定权。如职工代表认为该厂厂长或经理的决定与国民生计或劳资两利的方针有抵触时，职工代表得将不同的意见提交政府机关与劳动局请求仲裁。
    第三项：目前在工业中的技术干部很不够，管理干部更感缺乏，对于这个工业骨干问题必须有切实的解决办法。应从现任干部中提拔优秀分子逐步升级，帮助一切现任干部提高其智能。在工厂较多的地方，则开办职工学校。在工业以外的许多工作岗位上，有不少职工出身、或受过工业专门教育、或有过工业管理经历的干部，应征调一批来参加工业管理工作。对新解放企业中愿意继续服务的旧管理人员和技术人员，除查有证据的破坏分子外，必须尽量任用，必须很好地团结他们并帮助他们改变旧的劳动态度和管理方法，尤其是对待工人的态度，对自动来解放区服务的工业人材，应一律欢迎，使他们参加适当工作。此外，还须征调有相当文化水平的普通知识分子到工厂中学习管理工作。在学生、师资和设备等条件相当具备的地方，开办工业专门学校，以训练新的工业干部，也是很必要的。
    第四项：由于目前空前规模的战争环境，解放区农民们大量地出兵、出粮、出战勤，公教人员则坚持辛勤不懈的工作，解放区职工们更应当吃得苦，做得多。对于工时、工资、劳动保护和福利事业等，应当自觉地避免超过战时经济条件所许可的过高的要求。关于劳动时间，我们主张工厂工人一般实行八小时至十小时制度。对特殊企业或特殊情况，经当地政府批准，得延长或缩短之。但除战争紧急需要外，每日劳动时间连加工在内，最高不得超过十二小时。加工连续不得超过四天，全月不得超过四十八小时。农业工人、手艺工人及店员的劳动时间，可以按照习惯行之。
    第五项：关于工资的规定，必须保障任何普通职工的最低生活水准，即职工最低工资，连本人在内要够维持两个人的生活；同时，又必须保障职工的劳动热忱及技术的进步，而采取等级工资制及计时、计件工资制。但战时物价不可避免地会有波动，为保障职工最低生活水准，最低工资不能不因物价高涨而增加，而等级工资则因战时经济条件所限制却不能照此比例增加；因此，在规定战时工资时，不能不照顾这两者间的关联，并相当缩小等级工资各级间的距离。本此原则，我们主张依下列规定来调整职工的工资：
    第一点：工厂工人的工资，应采取交叉累进的等级制度。在此制度内，依据职工在生产过程中的分工与技术程度，规定等级，等数不限于三等，级数宜多，同级工资仍保留若干差别。评议工资时，对管理人员和技术人员，依其职责能力及学识经验；对工匠，依其技术；对熟练工人，依其熟练程度；对单纯体力劳动者，依其劳动程度；同时，照顾他们的工龄。应由各解放区地方政府，在工会同意之下给同种企业规定相对统一的工资标准，但不可对不同企业规定同一工资标准。再由各工厂根据政府颁布的工资标准，评议每个职工的具体工资（可在工厂或企业管理委员会之下组织工资评议委员会）。学徒待遇，不应列入工资系统，学徒亦不应参加工资评议。合理工资制度实行之后，个别有特殊技能的职工，需要给予特别优待者，须经高级管理机关批准。现时工资制度中存在着的过高或过低的偏向，本质上是一种平均主义。平均主义的发生，是受了供给制度及其他错误思想的影响。平均主义的实质，则在于不了解上述工资原则和等级制度的必要性和重要性，而或多或少地将被养人口、生活好坏、家庭出身、政治积极性、工人高于职员、学徒当作普通工人、不熟练工人当作学徒等等，作为评定工资的根据，并将各种工资等级排成非交叉、非累进、等级少、最高最低相距甚近的单一梯形，甚至对各种不同企业规定同一工资标准。这种平均主义严重地妨害了职工的生产积极性，尤其是努力提高技术的积极性，必须迅速纠正之。
    第二点：工资形式，计时或计件及其运用，应依劳动具体情况决定。计件制有刺激生产作用，应当推行；但在成品标准和成品检验方面还没有确切把握时，不可冒昧采用，同时还要防止原料浪费、工具损坏及损坏健康的过度劳动。
    第三点：在物价波动太大而工资调整发生困难的地方，还可采用职工生活补贴的办法，来调剂这种困难。生活补贴虽也应分为若干等级，但其差额不宜太大。
    第四点：工资计算应以几种必需品实物为工资计算基础（例如华北之“＠”、东北之“分”），并采用货币和实物混合的支付形式。为了进一步保证职工的实际工资，应采用新的实物配给制度。这可在国营、公营工厂中试行，取得经验后，再加以推广。
    第五点：农业工人、手艺工人及店员的工资制度，得从其习惯，但要以必需品实物为计算基础，并在支付时保证实际工资与名义工资一致。
    第六点：国营、公营工厂，除工资外，还可采用定时奖金办法，由政府规定或批准之。作坊、商店、私人企业中的分红、馈赠及其他奖赏习惯，凡对提高职工劳动积极性及技术进步有益者，均须予以保存，并须普及于全体职工。
    第六项：关于女工、青工、童工、学徒，应实行下列各点规定：
    第一点：男、女、青、童工，同工同酬。
    第二点：女工产前产后共休息四十五天；小产在三个月以内，共休息十五天，三个月以外，共休息卅天，均照给工资。
    第三点：禁用童工、女工的产业，及禁止女工、童工作夜工的劳动，由各解放区地方政府以法律定之。妨害身体发育的劳动，不得使用未满十四岁的童工。
    第四点：学徒最高学习期限，不得超过三年。学徒待遇，依其进度，逐步增加，最低够吃，最高除够吃够穿外给予相当津贴。师徒关系，应严守尊师爱徒原则；学徒必须尽心学习、努力生产、师傅不得虐待徒弟，尤须尽心传授技术。
    第七项：关于劳动保护和职工福利事业，因在中国从无基础，又处在战争时期，我们要求办理全国有系统的社会保险，还有困难，暂时应依下列各点办理：
    第一点：尽可能改善工厂健康设备和安全设备，政府定期派人检查。
    第二点：伤害、疾病、老残等等的医疗、津贴、抚恤，暂由工厂负责办理，或由工厂和工会共同负责办理，其办法由政府规定或批准，并监督实行。在工厂集中的城市或条件具备的地方，可以创办劳动的社会保险。
    第三点：职工福利事业（文教、合作及贫困的救济等），由工厂和工会共同负责或分别负责办理。
    第四点：以上办法适用于工厂职工，其他非工厂职工劳动保护和福利事业，由工会参照固有习惯与业主协定之。
    第五点：失业救济，主要为帮助就业、组织生产，由政府负责办理。
    第八项：国营公营企业中的劳动竞赛和劳动英雄运动，对发展生产起了积极作用，今后仍要提倡这种运动，并给以正确领导，使之成为以减低成本、提高生产质量，增加生产数量为目标的功利主义，成为互相学习、帮助少数、带动多数的集体英雄主义；而对那种粗制滥造的形式主义和脱离群众的个人锦标主义的偏向，则须加以坚决的纠正。在采用了工厂或企业管理委员会和职工代表会议制度的私人工厂和企业中，劳动竞赛和劳动英雄运动，也可以推行。
    第九项：劳动契约与劳动争议、应依下列各点办理：
    第一点：劳动须有契约，并尽可能采用集体契约形式，以便双方履行。集体契约应包括劳动条件、职工之任用、解雇与奖罚、劳动保护与职工福利、厂规要点等内容。
    第二点：劳动争议的处理方法，为协商、调解及仲裁，仲裁为最后程序，仲裁不服得向法院上诉。
    第三点：各解放区地方政府，须颁布集体契约条例及劳动争议处理办法，并须设立掌管有关劳动问题的部门。
    第五节：在解放区工会工作的任务，是在发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利的总方针下，团结全体职工，积极劳动，遵守纪律，保护职工的日常利益，教育职工提高他们的文化水平，尤其是提高他们的技术能力和业务水平。在国营、公营、合营企业中，发挥管理能力；在私营企业中，实现监督作用；在个体劳动中，促进技术改良和生产合作。高级的工会机关，有责任协助政府的劳动立法，并采取具体办法，以保证前节各项规定的合理实施。一切依法取得职工成份的男女职工，均有加入工会的权利；但会员征收，必须本自愿原则。工会不仅为会员服务，而且同样要为非会员服务，吸收他们参加活动，方能实际上代表全体职工，争取所有职工加入工会。工会内部须有充分的真正能集中群众意见的民主生活，须有切实的真正能够解决群众需要的经常工作，并须彻底整顿现在工会工作中的官僚主义作风和形式主义作风，做到工会名副其实地成为职工自己的组织。
    第四章：关于恢复全国总工会
    为了保障这个决议的实行，保障中国工人阶级在目前大革命中能够到处充分发挥其应有的先锋队的作用，必须成立中国工人阶级的统一的全国组织，以便在迅速发展的革命运动中能够经常指导各地职工群众的行动。为此，大会决定恢复第一次大革命时期的中华全国总工会，并训令全国总工会新的执行委员会：继续第一次大革命时期全国总工会的革命传统，在当前新的时期和新的条件之下，迅速组织全国的职工群众，并和全国各民主党派、各人民团体、各少数民族联合一致，为迅速推翻美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动政府在中国的统治，为建立统一的新民主主义的人民民主共和国而奋斗到底。　　　　　　　　　　　（完）
