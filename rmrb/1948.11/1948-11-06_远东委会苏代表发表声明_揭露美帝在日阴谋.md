　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 3rd: TASS, New York, October 29th: The Soviet representative to the Far Eastern Commission, Pan Youxin, delivered the following statement at a meeting held by the commission on October 28th: According to reports from various American news agencies, a secret military conference, chaired by General MacArthur, was held in Tokyo from October 12th to 14th. According to an Associated Press dispatch of October 15th, the conference discussed the issue of increasing the number of American occupation troops in Japan and measures to prevent a surprise attack on Japan, even though everyone knows that no one is threatening Japan. As pointed out in the dispatch, American military leaders expressed deep satisfaction with the conversion of the Japanese naval base Yokosuka into a modern naval base capable of serving a large number of naval vessels, which violates the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration, as well as the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission, regarding the disarmament and demilitarization of Japan. Pan Youxin asked the members of the Far Eastern Commission to pay attention to the above-mentioned news, and in discussing the Far Eastern Commission's decision of June 19, 1947, regarding the basic policy towards Japan after its surrender, stated that the Soviet delegation believes that the American representative to the Far Eastern Commission has a duty to inform the Far Eastern Commission of the essence of this matter.

　　远东委会苏代表发表声明
  　揭露美帝在日阴谋
    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社纽约十月二十九日讯：远东委员会苏联代表潘友新于十月二十八日在该委员会所举行的会议上发表下列声明：根据各美国通讯社的消息，以麦克阿瑟将军为主席的秘密军事会议，自十月十二日至十四日在东京举行。根据美联社十月十五日的消息，会议讨论了增加日境美占领军数目的问题以及预防日本遭受突袭的措施，虽然大家都知道没有谁威胁日本。如该消息中所指出的，美国军事领袖们对于将日本海军基地横须贺改变成为可供大量海军使用的现代化海军基地一点，深表满意，而这是违背关于日本解除武装及非军事化的开罗宣言和波茨顿宣言以及远东委员会决定的。潘友新请远东委员会委员们注意上述各消息，并在论及远东委员会一九四七年六月十九日关于对投降后的日本之基本政策的决定时称，苏联代表团认为，远东委员会美国代表有必要将这一问题的本质通知远东委员会。
