　　Shijiazhuang Liberation One Year
　　Great Development of Industry and Commerce
　　[Our Newspaper] In the past week (12th to 18th), 200,000 people in Shijiazhuang City commemorated their liberation anniversary with unparalleled joy, and vowed to greet the liberation of all of North China and the liberation of all of China with practical actions such as active production and enthusiastic participation in the war and army. In the year since the liberation of Shijiazhuang, under the leadership of the Communist People's Government, industry and commerce, as well as agricultural production in the suburbs, have greatly developed. Industry: From 543 factories in the Japanese occupation era to 725 under the Kuomintang, now there are 1,396. Commerce: From 1,249 households in the Japanese occupation era to 1,571 under the Kuomintang, now there are 2,136, transforming the commercial city, which mainly engaged in transit trade, into an industrial and commercial city. In addition, during this year, under the defense of the People's Liberation Army, the people of Shijiazhuang successfully thwarted the attempts of the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandits to launch sneak attacks in May and October, allowing them to live and work in peace and build their own city. The people of Shijiazhuang linked the anniversary of the liberation of their city with the liberation of the entire Northeast, the 31st anniversary of the October Revolution, and the victory of Shijiazhuang-Baoding, calling it "Fourfold Happiness." In order to solemnly commemorate this "Fourfold Happiness," the state-owned factories in Shijiazhuang successively launched a production emulation drive to strive for over-fulfilling the demobilization plan ahead of schedule and to make up for all losses during the preparedness period in a short period of time. All employees of the "Forward Factory," who completed two weeks of demobilization plan in 24 hours, recently unanimously approved the plan to complete ×× locomotives and ×× passenger and freight cars within a month and a half from the 15th of this month to the end of December. They also formulated specific requirements to shorten the time for repairing locomotives by 30% compared to before the preparedness period. One locomotive being repaired in the renovation workshop was originally scheduled to undergo water pressure testing on the 18th according to the new plan, but it was tested one day earlier on the 17th, and the effect was excellent. The Casting Workshop previously took three days to melt a furnace of copper, but now it only takes two days. The factory is now challenging all state-owned factories in Shijiazhuang. In the suburbs, the emancipated young peasants are launching a surge to join the security team to celebrate "Fourfold Happiness." Lei Shucheng, director of the agricultural association in Da’anshe Village, said: "I have carried on a pole and worked for others all my life with my eldest son. This year, I was given more than 20 mu of land. I want to let my son join the security team to protect our good times!" Yitang Village, Liuxinzhuang, Bajiazhuang, Donggucheng and other villages in the Fifth District have quickly over-fulfilled their tasks. The 79 primary schools and 4 middle schools in the city are also seizing the time to conduct teaching summaries and evaluations of model students to ensure that the teaching plan can be completed on time.

　　石市解放一年
  　工商业大发展
    【本报讯】近一周来（十二日至十八日）石家庄市二十万人民，以无比欢快的心情来纪念他们的解放周年，并誓以积极生产、踊跃参战参军等实际行动，来迎接全华北的解放与解放全中国。石家庄解放一年来，在共产党人民政府领导下，工商业与市郊区的农业生产都有很大的发展。工业：日寇时代五四三家，国民党时七二五家，现在一三九六家。商业：日寇时一二四九户，国民党时一五七一户，现在二一三六户，使当年主要营转运业的商业城市变为工商业城市。另外在这一年之内，石家庄群众在人民解放军的捍卫下，胜利地粉碎了蒋傅匪五月十月两次偷袭的企图，得以安居乐业和平建设自己的城市。石家庄人民把自己城市解放周年纪念、和东北全境解放、十月革命三十一周年纪念及石保之捷联在一起，叫做“四喜临门”。为了隆重地纪念这“四喜”，石家庄各公营工厂，先后开展一个争取超计划先期完成复员与争取在短时期内补足备战期中全部亏损的生产竞赛运动。二十四小时完成两个星期复员计划的“前进工厂”全体职工，最近又一致通过自本月十五日至十二月底一个半月内，完成××台机车和××个客货车的计划。他们并拟定具体要求，修机车的时间要比备战前缩短百分之三十。正在装修所修理的一部机车按新计划应该十八日才试水压，十七日即提前一天试验了，并且效果良好；铸工所以前化一炉铜得三天，现在只需两天。现在该厂正向全石家庄公营工厂挑战。市郊区，翻身的青年农民们正在掀起一个参加保安队的热潮，来庆祝“四喜”。大安舍村农会主任雷树成说：“我跟我大小子给人家扛了一辈子活，今年分了二十多亩地，我要让我小子参加保安队，保卫咱的好时光！”五区义堂村、柳辛庄、八家庄、东故城等村都迅速地超数完成任务。全市七十九处小学、四处中学，亦正抓紧时间进行教学总结评选模范学生。使教学计划能按时完成。
