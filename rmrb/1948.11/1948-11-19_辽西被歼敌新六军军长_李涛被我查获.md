Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th. Li Tao, commander of the Kuomintang's main force, the New Sixth Army, who was annihilated in the Liaoxi Campaign, has been captured. Li disguised himself as a beggar and fled to Beizhen after his entire army was wiped out at the end of last month, where he was captured by our forces. Li Tao is a native of Shaoyang, Hunan, and a graduate of the sixth class of the Whampoa Military Academy. He once served as the commander of the New 22nd Division. Li, like Liao Yaoxiang, who was identified a few days ago, was similarly declared by Chiang Kai-shek to have "died gloriously."
