    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: Paris dispatch: The Guy Mollet government, following the orders of its American masters, openly implemented bloody suppression against the miners who have been on strike for over twenty days. The heroic and unyielding miners' general strike continues. This nationwide strike of 350,000 miners in France began in early October. The reactionary Guy Mollet government, from the outset, used the pretext of so-called safety measures to dispatch military police for suppression. On the 22nd, they even issued orders to fire and continued to send large numbers of military police to attack various mines, arousing the miners' resolute resistance. In Saint-Étienne (central France), when government troops attacked the mines on the 21st, the coal miners immediately fought back bravely, repelling the invaders. The next day in Firminy (near Saint-Étienne), two workers were shot dead by government troops, and more than fifty were injured. On the same day at the Aroloyte mine (eighty miles north of Lyon), workers repelled government troops occupying the mine, capturing one colonel and one hundred soldiers, who were released the next morning. In the evening, government troops again attacked Aroloyte. On the 23rd, the French government illegally deployed its colonial troops into the mining areas, especially in the north.
    This frantic action aroused great indignation from the French working class and all the people. The General Confederation of Labour (CGT) Executive Bureau issued two consecutive statements on the 23rd, condemning the government's unconstitutional measures, pointing out that this was "an ugly provocation against the entire working class and the public," calling on workers in all industries across France to launch sympathy strikes, and appealing to miners and dockworkers in the United States and Britain to prevent coal shipments to the French government in support of the striking miners. It is reported that a general strike has begun in Firminy, and union leaders in the Saint-Étienne area have called for a general strike in the area. At the same time, the CGT in the industrially important Tarn department in southern France has ordered an indefinite general strike. Meanwhile, the French Communist Party issued a statement denouncing the French government for implementing the instructions of American imperialism and calling on workers in all industries to fully support the French miners.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: The French miners' general strike has gained widespread sympathy at home and abroad. According to the Electrical Communication Agency: Farmers around the mines are collecting food to send to the workers' families. Small business owners are selling products at lower prices. Work committees in industries, commerce, banks, or government agencies are raising funds on an unprecedented scale as a strike fund for the miners. Workers in the CGT and organizations outside the CGT are firmly demanding a strike until victory. Even the leaders of two unions led by reactionaries, namely "Workers' Force" and the Christian Workers' League, fully understand that their members are firmly standing with their CGT miner brothers, which is a characteristic of this strike. Abroad, TASS reports that the Romanian Miners' Union has telegraphed the French Miners' Union, expressing solidarity with the French miners' heroic struggle against the government's terrorist policies. The Dutch Confederation of Trade Unions "Eendracht Maakt Macht" telegraphed its support for the French miners, stating that the Dutch working people are ready to take care of 10,000 children for the French workers.

    法各地矿工坚决抵抗葛义挑衅
    击退进犯矿场的政府军
    农民、小商及各业工人广泛同情支援
    【新华社陕北廿八日电】巴黎消息：葛义政府秉承其美国主子的命令，向罢工二十余天的矿工公然施行血腥镇压，英勇不屈的矿工总罢工仍坚持中。这次全法卅五万矿工大罢工系在十月初罢起，葛义反动政府一开始就借口所谓安全措施，派遣军警进行镇压，至廿二日，竟下开枪令，并继续出动大批军警向各矿场进攻，引起煤矿工人的坚决抵抗。在圣德田（法国中部），当政府军队二十一日向矿场进攻时，煤矿工人立即英勇还击，将进犯者击退。次日在法尔明尼（圣德田附近）工人二人被政府军队枪杀，五十余人受伤。同日在阿洛伊特矿坑（里昂北八十哩），工人们将占领该矿坑之政府军队击退，并俘获上校一人及士兵百人，旋即于次晨将其释放。傍晚政府军队再向阿洛伊特进攻。二十三日法政府调用其殖民地部队违法开入矿区，特别是在北部。
    这种疯狂的行动激起了法国工人阶级和全体人民的伟大愤慨。总工会执行局二十三日连续发表两次声明，谴责政府此种违宪措施，指出这是“对整个工人阶级和公众的丑恶的挑衅”，号召全法各业工人发动同情罢工，并呼吁美英矿工及码头工人阻止运煤供应法国政府，以支持罢工矿工。据息，法尔明尼已开始总罢工，圣德田地区工会领袖已号召该地举行总罢工，在工业上重要的法国南部塔恩省总工会已下令无定期总罢工。同时，法共发表声明，痛斥法国政府执行美帝国主义的指示，并号召各业工人全力支持法国矿工。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】法国矿工的大罢工获得国内外的广泛同情。据电通社消息：矿场周围农民募集食品送给工人家庭。小商人以较低价格出卖产品。工业、商业、银行或政府机关等的工作委员会，都以一种从未有过的规模募集款项作为矿工罢工基金。总工会及总工会以外各组织中的工人们，都坚决要求罢工直到胜利为止，甚至两个在反动派领导下的工会，即“工人力量”与基督教工人联盟的领袖们也充分明白：他们的会员坚定地与总工会矿工兄弟站在一起，是这次罢工的特点。在国外，塔斯社电称：罗马尼亚矿工工会致电法国矿工工会，声援法国矿工为反对政府恐怖政策而进行的英勇斗争。荷兰职工会联合会“艾海德·瓦建拉尔”致电声援法国矿工，声明荷兰劳动人民已准备替法国工人照顾一万名儿童。
