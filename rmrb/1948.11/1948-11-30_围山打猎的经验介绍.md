Introduction to Hunting Experience by Surrounding a Mountain
    *Organized by Huonong*

    Based on the methods and experiences of the masses in hunting by surrounding mountains, we have compiled and introduced the following for reference by various regions:

    I. Wolves:

    A. Wolf Habits: Cunning and suspicious, hence the sayings "wolves fear waving hands, dogs fear crouching" and "wolves fear squatting." Although they forage at night and roam the mountains during the day, they usually do not have a fixed residence except when giving birth to wolf cubs, so the saying goes "constantly walking, slowly roaming, a thousand *li* in one night." They also "crawl when full, run when hungry," often crawling in one place for three to five days after eating their fill, mostly on the tops of large mountains during the day, where they can look around without obstruction. When they move, they prefer high ground to low ground, ridges to valleys, and run away when they see people, making them difficult to spot.

    B. Wolf Hunting Methods:

    (1) Sniping: Wolf hunting requires waiting, not chasing or surrounding. Hunters should first take a high vantage point to ambush them, then some people chase, and they will definitely run to higher ground, where they can be shot.

    (2) Netting Wolves: Use ropes as thick as fingers to make a large net, hang it on the surrounding wall. Young wolves born that year, eager to eat, will jump into the net, their legs will slip into the mesh, and they won't be able to jump out.

    (3) Trapping Wolves: Use iron traps, camouflaged well, with no trace visible. The procedure is more meticulous than planting landmines.

    (4) Wolf Boxes: On mountains where wolves often live, build wolf boxes in August and September, put dead pigs inside, feed them two or three times, and then install springs and tread sticks to trap them.

    (5) Carrying Wolves: First dig a large pit three *chi* long and two *chi* wide, leaving a door on one side, large enough for a person to crawl in. Weave a thorn branch covering, leaving a square hole of two to three *cun* long and wide in the middle. Catch a small pig and put it in the pit, cover the covering, cover with soil and rotten firewood. Then, a person wears an old sheepskin coat inside out (preferably a male sheepskin with a strong smell, because wolves won’t go near if they smell humans), crawls into the pit, and constantly makes the small pig cry. When the wolf grabs the pig with its paws, the person grabs its leg, stabs it horizontally, and then skewers it with an iron rod, so the wolf cannot escape. Sometimes people carry the covering on their backs while walking, so it is called carrying wolves.

    (6) Digging Wolf Pits: The pit is about one *zhang* and five *chi* deep, combined with a pigsty, set up at the edge of the village or on roads that wolves must pass. This method is the most effective way to catch wolves.

    II. Foxes:

    Foxes are also very cunning, often living in deep ditches where people don't go, and they don't enter dead dens, often entering live dens with several mouths, making it easy to escape. But they are extremely afraid of smoke. During the day, they don't walk on mountain ridges, but mostly on mountain saddles, running straight up and down slopes, hence the saying "flying foxes and running rabbits, unseen wolves." There are several ways to catch them:

    (1) After September, watch near water pits. When foxes come to drink, you can shoot accurately or chase them, or you can pre-place bait to poison them.

    (2) Propping Stone Traps: At the edge of pits where foxes often drink or on roads they must pass, use meat as bait, preferably fried in oil, and prop up a stone slab to press on them. The stone should weigh two to three hundred *jin* to hold them down.

    (3) Setting Iron Traps: Use iron rods about five *fen* thick, construct something similar to a rat trap. Use bait fried in sesame oil, or meat.

    (4) Organizing Encirclements: With three to seven or eight guns, organize an encirclement. Some people search and drive from ditches, stone ponds, and bank dens, while others specialize in guarding mountain saddles, and they can be caught. If you are shooting at running foxes, it will cost some gunpowder. Shoot them as soon as you see them. They will enter caves or stone ponds. Then, block the cave entrances and smoke them out. Listen for their coughing, then put out the fire and catch them. You can also set traps, *tiao gan* snares, or build stone boxes.

    III. Yellow Weasels and Wild Cats: They walk along flowing water ditches during the light snow season and along walls after heavy snow. This is the rule for catching them. Wooden boxes, ground boxes, or *tiao gan* can be used to catch them. Ground boxes are smooth holes three *chi* long and two *cun* thick, with oiled meat inside. The yellow weasel smells the scent and goes in to eat, and cannot get out.

    IV. Badgers and Badger Hairs: There are pig badgers and dog badgers, which are the most harmful to crops. In winter, they hibernate in caves, turning over every few times each "nine" period, coming out of the cave to gather grass and build nests. If hunters discover traces of them gathering grass and building nests, they can dig them out of the earthen caves or build stone boxes or hanging wooden boxes in stone caves. There are often seven or eight in one cave, and all can be caught.

    V. White-faced Musk Deer: They can climb trees and specialize in eating fruits, eating more than thirty *jin* in one night. In autumn, they eat a lot of small dates, and their actions are mostly at night. When discovered, they hang upside down on tree branches, and they don’t run when you shine a light on them, making them easy to catch.

    They also hibernate after the Beginning of Winter, and do not come out of the cave, so they can be caught by digging, using other methods similar to catching badgers.

    VI. Rabbits: Habits: "Standing guard in winter, standing in hollows in summer, climbing on the ground terraces in spring and autumn." "Thick grass, lie in thick grass, sparse grass, lie under a single tree." In autumn, they are at the base of slopes, in October they are on the mid-slope, and after the "nine" period they are at the mouth of the slope. When you spot them, you must pretend not to see them, otherwise the rabbit will run away. At this time, hunters must not panic, "When the rabbit leaves the nest, don't panic, shoot after three jumps, use an eagle to catch if you miss."

    When hunting rabbits, avoid shooting in a straight line. If you encounter a rabbit running towards you, shout, and the rabbit will veer to the side. Aim at the head and shoot. It is best to hunt after it snows in winter, as it is easy to track. Baby rabbits do not live in the same nest, often five *chi* to one *zhang* apart. If you find one, you can find more around it.

    VII. Leopards: There are three types: golden leopards, artemisia leopards, and earth leopards. Their habits are similar. Golden leopards are the fiercest, but the least brave. They like to occupy the highest places and run away when they see people from afar. "If people don't offend them, they don't offend people." But if you offend them, they are the fiercest. When first discovered, they don't bite people. At this time, you should shoot quickly and kill them with one shot, otherwise, they will definitely pounce back and bite people. Leopard hunting requires many people, mutual assistance. The person with the gun aims and shoots. If it doesn't die, the person with the *hu cha* goes out, and then the gun is fired again. It is best to have two people with guns and two with forks, forming an encirclement of four people.

    VIII. Squirrels, *li budai*, skunk cats, *bancang*, raccoon dogs, etc. are small animals that harm slope crops and are good at storing grain. They occupy stone holes in spring and autumn and earth caves in winter. The caves are mostly at the roots of banks. There are many branch caves, some for storing grain (often holding three to five *dou*), some for defecating, and some for resting. Catching methods: propping stones, digging caves, or using arsenic rice to poison them in spring.

    IX. Poisoning Methods for Foxes, Wolves, and Leopards: Eight-Step Intestine Severing Powder (nitric acid *shidinian*) is a special medicine for poisoning foxes, wolves, and leopards. The quality of the medicine can be tested by fire: if it burns quickly and has some explosiveness, it is good medicine; if it only smokes, it is poor.

    Pill Making Method: First, put mountain goat oil or paraffin wax into a copper spoon and heat it until it melts. Then, use a small stick the thickness of a cigarette to dip in the oil wax. The end of the stick dipped in oil should be shaved smooth, and the stick should be immersed in the oil for about seven *fen*. Dip in oil once and immerse in cold water once, so you can take off the oil cap, forming a pill shell. Then, use a stick slightly thicker than a cigarette, with one end shaved flat, dip in oil to make a pill cap. Put the medicine into the pill, cover it well, and then use a hot iron wire to weld it together.

    Dosage: Different wild animals require different amounts. For poisoning foxes, each *qian* of medicine can make twelve pills. For poisoning wolves and leopards, each *qian* of medicine can make six or seven pills. This medicine is highly poisonous. When loading the medicine, cover your mouth with a towel and avoid the medicine touching your hands directly. If you feel difficulty breathing while loading the medicine, drink some wine to detoxify. Foxes like to eat mice and grasshoppers the most. It is best to夹 this medicine in these baits, or in chunks of lamb. When poisoning wolves and leopards, put two or three pills in the necks of dead pigs and dead sheep. Wolves and leopards like to bite the neck first when eating these things.

    Foxes, wolves, and leopards often walk along the main road. The medicine should be placed on crossroads, or in deep mountains where foxes, wolves, and leopards often go, or on large stones where foxes often defecate. Foxes are very cunning. The bait should be kept clean and free of impurities, otherwise, they won’t eat it. If you use lamb as bait, you should also put some small pieces of meat next to it. If you only put one piece, they will often be suspicious and not eat it.

    Put out the medicine late and collect it early. If you find that the pill has been bitten open and the medicine powder is scattered on the ground, it is easy to find the poisoned vermin. Generally, you can find it within thirty to fifty steps of where the medicine was placed.

    Other issues such as shooting, aiming, mixing medicines, manufacturing small landmines, wild boar hunting, training hunting dogs in combination with eagles, etc., can be discussed at hunting seminars to exchange experiences. We won't introduce them here.

　　围山打猎的经验介绍
    活农整理
    现根据群众围山打猎的方法、经验，综合整理介绍如下，供各地参考：
    一、狼：
    甲、狼的习性：狡猾多疑，故有“狼怕摆手狗怕弯腰”及“狼怕古倒（蹲着）”之说。它虽晚上寻食，白天钻山，但除生狼羔时外，常无一定住处，所谓“紧走慢颠一夜一千”。它又是“饱爬饿跑”，吃饱以后常爬在一个地方，三五天不动，白天多爬在大山顶上，四面可以了望无阻的地方。行动起来，走高不走低，走梁不走凹，见人就跑，故较难发见它。
    乙、狼的打法：
    （一）抢打。打狼只有等而不能追，也不能围。猎人要先抢高点伏击它，然后一部分人追，它一定向高处跑，即可打上。
    （二）网狼：以手指粗的绳子，结成大网，悬挂在围墙上，当年生的小狼出来，急于吃东西，就向网内跳，四腿漏入网孔，再跳不出来。
    （三）夹狼：用铁夹子，伪装好，不能露一点痕迹，比埋地雷还要细致。
    （四）狼匣：在狼常住的山上，八、九月间垒上狼匣，里边放上死猪，喂它二、三次，然后再安簧和踏棍来关住它。
    （五）背狼：先挖一个长三尺、宽二尺的大坑，一边留一个门，能钻进人去就成。编一个荆拍子，当中留一个长宽二寸到三寸的方眼，捉一小猪放入坑内，把拍子盖上，上面盖上土和烂柴草，然后人反穿老羊皮袄（最好是公羊皮味大的，因狼嗅见人味就不去了），钻到坑内不断使小猪叫唤，等狼用脚抓猪，人就拉住它的腿，横扎一刀，再串上一个铁棍，狼就不能跑脱了。有时人背起拍子走，所以叫背狼。
    （六）挖狼阱：阱深一丈五尺左右，与猪圈结合起来，设于村边或狼必经之路。此法捉狼效力最大。
    二、狐狸：
    狐狸也很狡猾，经常住在人不去的深沟，又不入死洞，常入数口的活洞，便于逃走。但极怕烟熏。白天走路不走山梁，多走山鞍，上坡下坡直跑而过，故有“飞狐走兔，不见面的狼”之说。捕捉的办法有下面几种：
    （一）九月后在水坑附近了望，狐狸来喝水时，可以枪稳打或追打，也可豫置诱饵毒杀。
    （二）支石拍子：在狐狸经常喝水的坑边或必经之路上，以肉类为引，最好用油炸过，支石板压它，石重二三百斤，方可压住。
    （三）下铁夹子：用五分许的铁棍，构造与鼠夹相似。用香油炸过的食饵，肉类也可。
    （四）组织围场：以三支枪到七八支枪，组织一个围场，有人在沟里，石塘，岸洞各处搜赶，有人专在山鞍等站，即可打住。如果跑打，稍费药，可见面就打，必入洞或石塘，然后堵死洞口用烟熏，听它咳嗽，即可息火捉它。也可下夹子、挑杆套子、垒石匣。
    三、黄＠和野狸：小雪时走流水沟眼，大雪后走墙头，这是打它的规律。用木匣和地匣或挑杆都可捉，地匣是挖三尺长、二寸多粗的光滑窟窿，里面放上油炸的肉类，黄＠嗅味进去吃，就上不来了。
    四、獾和獾毫子。獾有猪獾狗獾之别，吃庄稼最厉害。冬天入洞蛰伏，每逢数一次九翻一次身，出一次洞口，搂草筑窝，猎人发觉它搂草筑窝的踪迹，如果是土洞可挖捉，石洞可垒石匣子、吊木匣子。一洞内常有七八个，都可打住。
    五、白脸獐。能上树，专吃果类，一夜可咬三十多斤。到秋后，多吃小枣，行动多在夜间，被人发觉后，两足倒挂在树枝上，用火光一照就不跑了，很容易捉住。
    立冬后也入蛰，不出洞口，挖洞可捉住，其他办法和打獾同。
    六、兔子：习性：“冬站岗，夏站凹，春秋两季地阶爬”。“草稠卧草稀，草稀卧独棵”，秋后在坡跟，十月站半坡，数九后站坡嘴，发觉后须装着没见它，不然兔子就跑了。这时猎人不能发慌，“兔出窝别发慌，跳三跳要打枪，打不住用鹰捉”。
    打兔子切忌打顺枪，如遇兔子向你跑来，喊一声，兔子向旁边一横，瞄准嘴头一枪就打住。冬天下雪后最好打，容易跟踪追迹。小兔羔不在一窝住，常隔五尺至一丈远，发觉一个，在四外都可找着。
    七、豹：有金钱豹，艾叶豹，土豹子三种，习性相类似，以金钱豹最凶猛，胆最小，爱占最高处，远远见人就遛了。“人不犯它它不犯人”。如果犯了它，它却是最凶猛。在刚发现时，它不咬人，这时应快开枪，一枪打死才行，不然，它一定反扑过来咬人。打豹必须人多，互相援助，拿枪人瞄准打一枪，如果不死，拿护叉的支出去，再端枪打。最好两个拿枪两个拿叉，四个人组成一个围。
    八、松鼠、狸布袋、骚猫子、搬仓、貉＠等都是为害坡地庄稼的小动物，善于贮藏粮食。春秋占石穴，冬天占地洞，洞多在岸根。支洞很多，有盛粮食的（常常装三、五斗），有拉屎的，有休息的。捕打的办法：支石压、挖洞、或于春季用信（砒）米毒杀。
    九、狐、狼、豹的毒杀法：八步断肠散（硝酸士地年）是毒杀狐、狼、豹的特效药。药质好坏可以火试验：如很快烧着并有些爆炸性为好药；光冒烟，则较差。
    药丸制法：先用山羊油或洋腊放入铜杓内加火使其溶化，然后用纸烟粗的小棍沾油腊，沾油的一端要削光，棍子入油约七分长即可。沾一次油浸一次冷水，即可将油帽脱下，成一个丸壳。再用一比纸烟稍粗的小棍，一端削齐，沾油即可制成丸盖。将药盛入丸内，盖好后用热铁丝烫合即成。
    药量：不同野兽用不同量，毒杀狐子每钱药可制十二个丸，毒杀狼豹则每钱药可制六七个丸。这药是剧毒，装药时要用手巾蒙住嘴，不要使药直接碰到手上，装药时如感到呼吸困难，喝些酒可解毒。狐子最喜欢吃老鼠及蚂蚱，毒杀狐子最好夹在这类食饵里，夹在羊肉块内也可以。毒杀狼、豹，要将药丸二、三个夹于死猪死羊的脖子上，狼豹吃这些东西喜欢先咬脖子。
    狐狸、狼、豹，往往顺着大道走，药要放在十字路上，或放在深山狐、狼、豹常到的地方，或狐狸常拉屎的大石头上。狐狸很狡猾，食饵上要保持干净，不要带有杂味，否则它就不吃了。如果以羊肉做食饵，旁边还要多放些小肉块，只放一块它往往多疑不吃。
    放药要晚放早收。如果发现药丸被咬破，药面撒在地上，即很好寻找毒死的害兽，一般距放药三几十步内即可找着。
    其他关于打枪、瞄准、配药、制造小地雷等问题，打野猪问题、训练猎狗与鹰结合等问题，可召集打猎座谈会交流经验，这里不多介绍。
