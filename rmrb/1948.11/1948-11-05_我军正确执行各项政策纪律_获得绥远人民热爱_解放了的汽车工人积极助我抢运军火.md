Xinhua News Agency, Suiyuan-Mongolia Front, 3rd. The various policies and strict discipline implemented by the People's Liberation Army in the vast newly recovered urban and rural areas of Suiyuan have been embraced and welcomed by the people everywhere. When a unit of the PLA recovered Qingshuihe County on September 25, most of the troops withdrew outside the city as soon as the battle ended, leaving only a few to restore order and sending inspection teams to patrol the streets and check discipline. Similarly, on September 27, when the unit captured Lama Bay in Tuoketuo County, it also withdrew outside the village after the battle. People were sent in first to check discipline and publicize policies before orderly borrowing of housing. Although the soldiers had marched for a day and a night and fought three consecutive battles, they actively cleaned the streets and courtyards for the masses as soon as they settled down. Propaganda teams carried out the work of comforting the people and publicizing the victories in the liberation of Jinan and Jining. The influence of the PLA's strict discipline spread rapidly throughout southern Suiyuan. When the PLA continued to advance to Heicheng, a ferry crossing on the Yellow River north of Lama Bay, residents opened their doors as soon as they saw our troops entering the city. Wherever the army passed, it was the autumn harvest season. The PLA's meticulous non-violation of the people's property led the farmers to praise, "If it were Fu Zuoyi's troops, let alone grain, they would even rob the grass." When the PLA camped and rested, they also helped the farmers thresh the grain. At the end of September, a unit was stationed in a village on the outskirts of Guihua city. The soldiers helped the farmers with the autumn harvest, threshing the grain and chatting with them, which was very harmonious. The farmers insisted on steaming pancakes and cakes to thank them, but we politely declined. A landlord insisted on giving the kang (heated brick bed) to the soldiers to sleep on, while he himself slept on the ground on straw. Soldier Hao Wencai put his bedding and cotton-padded clothes on the landlord, who said with emotion, "You are really too good, Fu Zuoyi is just spreading rumors." The PLA borrowed and returned the people's belongings, and compensated for any damage, which was praised by the people. In Liangcheng and nearby villages, the PLA's discipline inspection teams investigated door-to-door and found that only a few civilian workers had slightly damaged borrowed items, and they were compensated and apologized for at market prices. The people spread the word: "We have never seen a team that compensates the people for things and speaks kindly. This team is really hard to find even with a lantern."

    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui Border Region, 3rd. The People's Liberation Army's correct implementation of urban policies and discipline has won the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people in Suiyuan. The performance of the working class is even more active. The behavior of Duoxin Fang, an automobile worker in Jining, is a typical example of this. Duoxin Fang was originally a driver in Fu bandit's motorcade. He was liberated when the PLA recovered Jining on September 27 this year. He and sixty or seventy other automobile workers and more than fifty cars they drove were liberated at the same time. When the flames of war had not yet been extinguished, the PLA took great care of their lives and protected their safety. Therefore, they realized even more that the PLA was truly their liberator and asked to immediately join the PLA's work, and were allowed to continue driving their original cars. The day after Jining was recovered (September 28), the 35th Army, which Fu bandit had sent as reinforcements from Zhangjiakou, approached Jining. In order to find an opportunity to annihilate the enemy, the PLA temporarily withdrew from the city. Therefore, Duoxin Fang and the other drivers drove this batch of captured cars and sped through the fields day and night. They rushed the military supplies from the city to a certain place to unload them, and immediately returned to the city to rescue the second and third batches.... On September 29, after the enemy troops invaded Jining, they continued to transfer the rescued military supplies to the designated location. They had not slept for several days and could not eat hot meals, only eating the dry rations they carried on the cars. The PLA leaders advised them to rest, but they continued to work day and night, determined to perform meritorious service, until they successfully completed their tasks on October 24. During this period, a moving story of selflessness and devotion to the public occurred: Duoxin Fang's car was loaded with shells and was about to be transported from a certain place when the front of the car suddenly caught fire, and a large number of shells and gasoline were parked next to the car, creating an extremely dangerous situation. At this critical moment, Duoxin Fang showed the great spirit of the working class. He desperately pulled away the crowd (including a PLA leader), saying, "It is not necessary for everyone to sacrifice, I will die alone." Then, with quick movements, he wrapped his cotton-padded clothes and quilt around the front of the car and pounced on it. The fire was extinguished. Duoxin's right hand was burned by the fire, but he did not rest and continued to drive the car to transport the shells.

    我军正确执行各项政策纪律
    获得绥远人民热爱
    解放了的汽车工人积极助我抢运军火
    【新华社绥蒙前线三日电】在绥远广大新收复区城乡中，解放军所实行的各项政策和严明的纪律，到处受到人民的拥护和欢迎。九月二十五日解放军某部收复清水河县城时，战斗一结束，部队大部就撤出城外，只留少数在城内恢复秩序，并派出检查组在街上巡逻与检查纪律。同样的，九月二十七日该部打下托克托县喇嘛湾时，于战斗结束后也撤出村外，先派人检查纪律、宣传政策后，才又有秩序的借房住宿。战士们虽经一昼夜行军及连续三次作战，但一住下即积极地为群众打扫街道房院。宣传队就进行安民和宣传解放济南、集宁的胜利。解放军纪律严明的影响飞快地传遍了绥南。当解放军继续挺进至喇嘛湾以北黄河渡口黑城镇时，居民一见我军进城就都开了门。大军过处，正值秋收。解放军的秋毫无犯，使农民们连声称赞说：“如果是过傅作义的军队，不用说粮食、连草也抢光了。”解放军在宿营休息时，并帮助农民打场。九月底某部驻归绥城郊某村，战士们帮助农民秋收，与农民一块打场，一块谈天，非常融洽。农民们硬要蒸饼蒸糕来酬谢，我们均婉言谢绝。有一位房东硬要把炕让给战士们睡，自己在地下铺草睡。战士郝文才把自己的被套和棉衣给房东盖上，房东感动地说：“你们真太好了，傅作义尽是造谣。”解放军对老百姓的用具有借有还，损坏赔偿，受到人民的交口赞誉。在凉城及其附近村庄，解放军纪律检查逐户调查，仅发现少数民工对借物略有损坏，均照市价赔偿和道歉。人民传诵着：“历来没见过给老百姓赔东西，说好话的队伍。这队伍真是打上灯笼也难找。”
    【新华社晋绥三日电】人民解放军正确地执行城市政策纪律，获得了绥远广大人民的热烈拥护。工人群众的表现更为积极。集宁汽车工人朵新芳的行为就是这样的典型例子。朵新芳原来是傅匪汽车队的司机，今年九月二十七日解放军收复集宁时才被解放，与他同时被解放的有六、七十个汽车工人和他们所驾驶的五十余辆汽车。当战火尚未熄灭时，解放军就十分关照他们的生活，并保护他们的安全。他们因而更加体会到解放军真正是自己的解放者，要求立即参加解放军工作，当  允许仍然驾驶原来的汽车。收复集宁的第二天（二十八日），傅匪从张家口增援来的三十五军逼近了集宁。解放军为寻找歼敌机会，暂时撤出该城。于是朵新芳及其他的司机工友们便驾驶着这批被缴获的汽车在田野中不分昼夜地飞驰起来，他们从城市抢运军火物资至某地卸下，立刻又返城抢救第二批第三批……。二十九日，敌军侵入集宁后，他们又继续把抢救出来的军火物资转运到指定地点。他们好几天没有睡觉，也吃不上热饭，只在汽车上吃携带的干粮。解放军首长曾劝告他们休息，但他们仍夜以继日地工作，坚决立功，直到十月二十四日胜利完成任务。这期间曾发生一件舍己为公的动人故事：朵新芳的汽车满载了炮弹，正拟从某地起运，突然车头着火，而车旁又停放着大量炮弹和汽油，情况极端危险。朵新芳在这危急关头，表现出工人阶级的伟大气魄。他拼命拉开众人（其中有一位解放军首长），他说：“不必要大家牺牲，要死只死我一个人。”然后他以迅速的动作拿自己的棉衣和被子裹着黄土地车头猛扑过去。火扑灭了。朵的右手被火灼伤，但他并不休息，又继续驾着汽车转运炮弹去了。
