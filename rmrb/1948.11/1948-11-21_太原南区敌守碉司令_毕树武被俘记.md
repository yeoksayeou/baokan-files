The Capture of Bi Shuwu, Enemy碉 Commander of the Southern District of Taiyuan
    Ren Bingru, Tang Renjun

Our army captured the enemy stronghold of Beiying, and captured alive Bi Shuwu, the Yan bandit's 碉 commander of the southern district of Taiyuan, and Wang Zengfu, the commander of the Chunshuyuan Fortress, and others. To the east and west of Beiying are the Datong-Puzhou and Zhengding-Taiyuan Railways, making it the first station twenty miles south of Taiyuan. The Yan bandits painstakingly built twenty-five blue stone and cement碉s here, in addition to many brick碉s and bunkers. The intersecting firepower formed a so-called "solid defense" to protect the Wusu Airport eight miles to the south, and to act as a barrier for the walls of Taiyuan City. Bi Shuwu, the Yan bandit's 碉 commander of the southern district and deputy commander of the Provisional 45th Division, and Wang Zengfu, the commander of the Chunshuyuan Fortress, led the first regiment of the division and a heavy machine gun battalion, entrenched there. On October 8th, our army, with a swift move, first captured Huangling Village, a stronghold surrounding Beiying. At dawn on the 9th, two arrows of our army launched a general attack on Beiying from the southeast and southwest. The assault team of our army in the southeast broke through the enemy's forward position in just four minutes, and rushed straight to the Southeast Plum Blossom碉. Gao Wenxing, the squad leader of a certain company, took the demolition team and blew a hole in the碉. The enemy on the碉 still wanted to resist. Soldiers Liu Gui and Qin Haitang used the skills they had practiced in training to throw grenades from the top of the碉. With a loud bang, the enemy's ammunition was detonated, and the碉 was in a state of chaos. Comrade Liu Er immediately seized the opportunity and shouted, "Those who surrender their guns are our friends, those who don't will die!" The enemy quickly replied, "Surrender! Surrender!" Then, the enemy碉 company commander, with two heavy machine guns and thirteen surviving soldiers, came out of the black earth cave. Our army, attacking from the southwest, under the cover of fierce artillery fire, launched a fierce attack on the fortress碉 where Wang Zengfu, the commander of the Chunshuyuan Fortress, was located. Hao You'an, Xu Fengyi, and other sharpshooters aimed and fired, hitting the target every time. The explosion of the shells and the enemy's ammunition caused by the shells resulted in a deafening roar. Of the fifty or so Yan bandits who tried to hold on, only nine were left, six were wounded, and three were scared unconscious. The so-called fortress commander Wang Zengfu quickly stretched out the butt of his gun and waved it back and forth to show his surrender, and walked out of this "fortress" with a face full of dust. All the碉s were quickly cut off, surrounded, and resolved, leaving only a main碉 where Bi Shuwu retreated. At this time, Bi Shuwu still did not indicate his surrender, and our army issued the final attack order. Squad leader Ma Bingxiang and his soldiers of a certain company accepted the glorious assault mission. They摸ed to the front of the碉. Deputy squad leader Yang Shiping led the demolition team to immediately blow up an outer moat two fathoms wide and two fathoms deep. The brave men rushed along the road that had been blown out into the enemy's depth, and finally pushed aside the gun holes that the enemy had blocked with stones, bricks, and backpacks, and threw grenades and incendiary bombs in together. Soldier Xu Milin saw a few figures moving in the darkness, immediately ran to block them, and ordered loudly: "Stop! Where is your碉 commander?" A tall man raised both hands and answered tremblingly: "I am, I am." Bi Shuwu became a prisoner of the People's Liberation Army in this way. At this time, the Yan bandit soldiers in the two碉s at the station walked out with their guns. When our army went there, they said, "We have been waiting for you for a long time." The captured officer, the instructor of the Yan bandit's Provisional 45th Division's direct artillery battalion, said: "Good heavens, your (referring to the People's Liberation Army) shells are so numerous and accurate that our (referring to the Yan bandit) firepower cannot be deployed at all, and no matter how strong the碉s are, they cannot withstand the bombardment of your artillery and explosives!"

　　太原南区敌守碉司令
  　毕树武被俘记
    任冰如　唐仁均
    我军攻克北营据点，活捉阎匪太原南区守碉司令毕树武和椿树园要塞司令王增福等。北营东西两侧有同蒲、正太两条铁路，是太原城南二十里地第一个车站。阎匪在此苦心修筑了二十五个青石洋灰碉，另外还配搭上许多砖碉和地堡。火力交叉纵横，构成所谓“坚固防御地”，以掩护其南面八里的武宿飞机场，屏障太原城垣。阎匪南区守碉司令兼暂四十五师副师长毕树武和椿树园要塞司令王增福，率领该师第一团和一个重机枪营，困守于此。十月八日，我军以神速动为首先攻占北营周围据点黄陵村。九日拂晓，我军两个箭头从东南和西南向北营总攻。东南我军突击队，只四分钟就突破了敌人的前沿阵地，直扑东南梅花碉。某连三班长高文兴，带着爆破组，把碉堡炸了一个窟窿，碉楼上的敌人还想抵抗，战士刘贵、秦海堂拿出练兵中练就了的本领，把手榴弹从碉顶上投进去，轰然一声，把敌人的弹药引炸了，碉堡里哄隆隆的乱成一团。刘二同志马上抓紧机会喊道：“缴枪就是朋友，不缴枪死路一条！”敌人连忙回答：“缴枪！缴枪！”接着，敌守碉连长带着两挺重机枪，和十三个残存的士兵，从黑土洞里走了出来。由西南攻击的我军，在猛烈炮火掩护下，向着椿树园要塞司令王增福所在的要塞碉猛攻。郝有安、徐凤义等神炮手，瞄准射击，百发百中。炮弹以及炮弹所引起的敌人弹药的爆炸结果，一片天崩地裂的巨响，五十多个企图固守的阎匪只剩了九个，六个挂了彩，三个吓昏了。所谓要塞司令王增福，连忙伸出枪把来回摇摆，表示投降，并带着满脸灰尘走出了这个“要塞”。全部碉堡都迅速地被我割裂、包围、解决，只剩下毕树武退守的一个主碉了。这时，毕树武还不表示投降，我军即发出最后攻击令。某连马丙祥班长和他的战士们，接受了光荣的突击任务。他们摸到碉堡跟前，副班长杨世平带领爆破组把一道两丈宽两丈深的外壕立刻爆破了，勇士们顺着这条炸出来的道路冲到敌人的纵深，最后拨开敌人用石头砖块和背包堵塞了的枪眼，把手榴弹与燃烧弹一齐投进去。战士许米林在夜色中看见几个人影在移动，马上跑去堵住，高声命令：“站住！你们守碉司令在哪里？”一个大个子举起两只手，战战兢兢回答着：“我就是，我就是。”毕树武就这样当了人民解放军的俘虏。这时，车站上两个碉堡里面的阎匪士兵，拿着枪走出来。我军一去，他们就说：“我们早就在等你们了。”被俘军官阎匪暂四十五师直属炮兵营的指导员说：“老天爷，你们（指解放军）的炮弹又多又准，我们（指阎匪）的火力根本展不开，再多的坚强碉堡也经不住你们大炮和炸药的轰击！”
