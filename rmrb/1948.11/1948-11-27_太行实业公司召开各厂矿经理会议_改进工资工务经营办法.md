[Taihang Electric] Taihang Industrial Company convened a meeting of factory and mine managers on October 2nd, lasting nineteen days. The meeting conducted detailed research on several major issues, including wages, work, and business management, and formulated new work plans. The main issues are summarized as follows: (1) Wage policy: Connecting the current wage situation to historical development, the meeting clarified that the main errors in the past were threefold: (1) Egalitarianism was widespread. A serious example is the carpenters at the Dazhong Coal Mine, where regardless of skill level or labor input, each work unit received 7.2 jin of millet. (2) There was no unified wage standard in various factories and mines. In terms of wage levels, some had three grades and nine levels, some had four grades and twelve levels, some had five grades and fifteen levels, and some were on a fixed production contract system: regardless of grade, the requirement was how much coal was produced per person per day, without quality requirements or overproduction bonuses. Regarding future issues, six principles were uniformly stipulated for determining wages: First, based on the value of production; second, based on the changes in the war environment and productivity, not simply compared with the pre-war period; third, based on the size of responsibilities; fourth, based on the results of production, equal pay for equal work, treating child labor and female labor the same; fifth, based on the work conditions and the impact of work on health; and sixth, industrial wages should be slightly higher than rural wages. Based on the above six principles, a cross-progressive wage system was discussed as an implementation plan. It is now being submitted to higher authorities for review and approval. (2) Work management: There are two basic requirements for organizing and leading production: one is to improve efficiency, and the other is to reduce costs. Regarding improving efficiency, the past shortcomings were that there were few technical personnel, their role was not fully utilized, and the leadership lacked experience in business management, resulting in a state of anarchy in production and very low efficiency. After research, it was clarified that improving efficiency should start from three aspects: First, strengthen organization and maximize labor. Leaders must be familiar with the technical proficiency and output of each labor force, and must also understand all aspects of the production process and use labor reasonably and closely. Second, correctly implement the policy of uniting technical personnel. In the past, there was insufficient understanding of this, and many places did not unite technical personnel well. In some places, there was also blind accommodation, which affected the work. In the future, under the premise of the factory director responsibility system, technical personnel should be given certain powers to enable them to play a good role. At the same time, the understanding of employees should be improved to achieve enterprise, and in addition to policy errors, technology determines everything. Third, promote the use of more brains and create a research and improvement atmosphere. Emphasis should be placed on summarizing and improving the level of scientific knowledge. Regarding reducing costs, in the future, raw materials and equipment must be supplied on time and in quantity, the quality of raw materials must be good, and attention must be paid to overcoming waste and stipulating reward systems. Grasping cost accounting can reveal various problems in the production process. In the past, cost accounting was very chaotic, and even if the task was completed, it was blind. In order to avoid the impact of prices and adapt to the different business requirements of various factories and mines, after research, a new accounting unit was created, called "Ben" [Root, or Basis]. The "Ben" of something is based on the category of that thing, with a category character added next to it. For example, one jin of iron pot: charcoal 12 jin, ore 3.5 jin, crucible clay 15.56 liang, Xiantan charcoal 1 liang, coal fines 3.5 jin, wages 0.13 @. The cash of each factory and mine is converted into "Ben" according to the current price, and converted into currency according to "pot" and reported to the company. The company calculates the total "Ben" and calculates profit and loss according to "Ben". This is a new method, which can be researched and improved at any time during use. (3) Establish unified and centralized management. In July of last year, according to the conditions at the time, the policy of independent operation and using factories to support factories was proposed, which gave play to the enthusiasm and creativity of each factory and overcame many difficulties. Now, each factory not only has the conditions for production, but also accumulated considerable strength, which has the conditions for unification. In the future, production tasks will be uniformly stipulated, funds will be used uniformly, price policies will be unified, external equipment will be supplied uniformly, and accounting units will be unified using "Ben". Regarding future industrial production, the general policy and task of the district party committee is to improve business management, combine it with running worker welfare undertakings, adjust wages, and overcome egalitarianism. According to this instruction, after detailed research, a work plan for the ten months from October this year to July next year was formulated, and the production tasks and work improvement steps of each factory and mine were specifically stipulated.

　　太行实业公司召开各厂矿经理会议
  　改进工资工务经营办法
    【太行电】太行实业公司于十月二日召开各厂、矿经理会议，历时十九天，对工资、工务、经营管理等几个重大问题都有详细研究，并制订了新的工作方案。几个主要问题总结为（一）工资政策：从现行工资情况联系到历史发展，明确了过去的错误主要有三点：（１）普遍的存在着平均主义。比较严重的如大众煤矿的木工，不论技术高低，不分劳力支付多少，每工都是七斤二两小米。（２）各厂、矿均无统一的工资标准。工资等级上，有的三等九级，有的四等十二级，有的五等十五级，还有的是定产包工制：不分等级，而按人数一天要多少煤，没有质量要求，也没有超产奖励。关于今后问题，统一规定了确定工资的六条原则：一是根据生产价值大小；二是依据战争环境及生产力的变化，不能简单与战前比较；三是根据职责大小；四是根据生产结果实行同工同酬，对童工女工一样看待；五是根据工作条件好坏及工作对健康影响程度；六是工业工资应稍高于农村工资。从以上六个原则出发，讨论出以交叉累进工资制为实施方案。现正请示上级审查批准。（二）工务工作：组织领导生产有两个基本要求：一个是提高效率，一个是降低成本。关于提高效率方面，过去的缺点是技术人员少，发挥其作用也不够，领导上又缺乏经营管理的经验，致使生产中表现无政府状态，效率很低。经过研究，明确了提高效率应从三方面入手：一是加强组织，发挥劳力至最大限度。领导人必须熟悉每一劳力的技术熟练程度和产量多少，又须了解生产过程中的各个环节，合理的严密的使用劳力。二是正确执行团结技术人员政策。过去对此认识不够，不少地方没把技术人员团结好，个别地方也曾盲目的迁就过，都使工作受到影响。今后要在厂长负责制的前提下，给技术人员一定职权，使其能很好的发挥作用。同时要提高职工认识，达到企业化，除政策上不犯错误外，技术决定一切。三是提倡多用脑子，造成研究改良的风气。重视总结，提高科学知识水平。关于降低成本方面，今后要做到原料器材按期按数及时供给，原料质量要好，并注意克服浪费，规定奖励制度。抓住成本计算，就能发现生产过程中的种种问题。过去计算成本很混乱，即使完成任务，也是盲目的。为了不受物价影响和适应各厂、矿不同业务的要求，经大家研究，创造了一个新的核算单位，叫做“本”。什么东西的本，就按该物的类属，旁加一类属字。比如一斤铁的钵，炭十二斤，矿石三斤半，坩土十五斤五两六钱，宪炭十两，煤末三斤半，工资零点一三＠。各厂矿现金按当时物价折本，按“钵”折合货币报公司，公司计算出总本，根据本计算盈亏，这是个新方法，运用中可随时研究改进。（三）建立统一集中的经营工作。去年七月根据当时条件，提出单位经营，以厂养厂的方针，发挥了各厂里的积极性、创造性，克服了许多困难；现在各厂不仅有了生产条件，而并积蓄了相当力量，具备了统一的条件。今后生产任务统一规定，资金统一使用，价格政策统一，外来器材统一供给，核算单位统一用本。关于今后工业生产，总的方针和任务，区党委的指示是改善经营管理，结合举办工人福利事业，调整工资，克服平均主义。根据这个指示，经过详细研究，制定了今年十月至明年七月十个月的工作计划，各厂矿的生产任务和工作改进步骤，都有具体规定。
