Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Reports from various sources: The election to replace a large number of members in the French Republic's Senate, totaling 320 senators, took place on November 7th in mainland France and its overseas territories. In this election, the new cabinet's Minister of the Interior, Moch, and the well-known De Gaulle supporter, Jacquinot, painstakingly altered the electoral law, opposing the fair proportional representation system proposed by the French Communist Party (PCF). They formulated a complex and undemocratic electoral law, where the election was conducted in three stages, with voting based on a majority system to elect electors, instead of using proportional representation. This particularly favored the traditionally conservative agricultural regions, giving them a weight far exceeding their actual proportion. At the same time, the various parties of the "Third Force" closely cooperated with De Gaulle's "Rally of the French People" (RPF), "jointly nominating candidates with the De Gaulle's People's Alliance in places where there was a risk of being defeated by the Communist Party" (Agence France-Presse). This allowed De Gaulle's "Rally of the French People" to gain 55 seats in this Senate election, a number completely disproportionate to its actual strength. Although the French Communist Party suffered losses in agricultural areas due to this undemocratic electoral law, resulting in only 16 seats, the number of votes received by the PCF still steadily accounted for about one-third of the national total. Agence France-Presse quoted the opinion of the Paris Observer, stating that the strength of the PCF had not suffered significant losses, and in densely populated areas based on proportional representation, such as the Seine department (according to Agence France-Presse, the Seine department is the only province that has retained the proportional representation system unchanged), the PCF still maintains its position. In that province, the PCF obtained 39.5 percent of the total votes. (Note: The French Senate is the second chamber of the National Assembly. It can offer opinions on bills passed by the National Assembly, but the final decision-making power for bills rests with the National Assembly.)

The French Communist Party's official newspaper, L'Humanité, pointed out in its commentary on the election results on the 8th: Due to class hatred and anti-communist frenzy, the right-wing Socialist leaders once again demonstrated that they are in complete agreement with De Gaulle on the issue of Marshallizing France and attacking the working class. The PCF also issued a statement on the evening of the 9th, calling on all workers, Communists, Socialists, all republicans, Catholics, and patriots to be vigilant against the danger of fascism. It pointed out that only a broad coalition government, including the Communist Party but excluding the rebellious De Gaulle and his followers, could block the road to fascism for France. The statement, after pointing out that the new Republic's Senate does not represent the will of the French people, stated that the Communist Party is prepared to assume its responsibility in this broad coalition to strengthen the republican system threatened by the fascists.

　　法国新选出的参院不能代表人民意志
    【新华社陕北十六日电】各方报导：改选法国共和国参议会参院三百二十名议员中大量议员的选举，于十一月七日在法国本土及其海外属地举行。在这次选举中，新会党内政部长摩许和著名戴高乐分子贾科比处心积虑地篡改选举法，与法共所提公平的比例代表制的办法相对立，他们制订一套复杂的不民主的选举法。即选举分三个阶段进行，投票以多数票为基础选出选举人，而不是用比例代表制。特别偏袒向来保守的农业区域，给了它们远超过其实际比例的重量。同时，在选举中，“第三种力量”各党与戴高乐的“人民联盟”密切合作，“在有被共产党击败危险的地方，就和戴高乐人民联盟联合推出候选人”（电通社）。这样，就使戴高乐的“法兰西人民联盟”在这次参院选举中获得了与它的实际力量完全不相称的五十五席。法国共产党虽然因为这种不民主的选举法而在农业区域受到损失，致仅获得十六席，但法共所获得选民票数仍稳定地占了全国的约三分之一。法新社引巴黎观察家意见，法共力量并未受到重大损失，而在以比例代表制为基础的人口稠密区域，如塞纳省（据电通社称，塞纳省为仍保持比例代表制不变的唯一省份），法共今仍保持它的地位。该省法共所获为总票数的百分之三十九点五。（按：法国参院系国会之第二院，它对国民议会的议案可以提出意见，但议案之最后决定权仍国民议会。）
    法共机关报人道报在八日评选举结果时指出：由于阶级仇恨，由于反共的疯狂，右翼社会党领袖们又一次表现了：在使法国马歇尔化和进攻工人阶级问题上，他们与戴高乐完全一致。法共并于九日晚发表声明，号召一切劳动者、共产党员、社会党员、一切共和分子、天主教徒和爱国者警惕法西斯的危险。指出只有一个包括共产党在内，但排除谋叛作乱的戴高乐及其党徒的大联合政，才能阻断使法国通往法西斯主义的道路。声明在指出新的共和国参议会并不代表法国人民的意志后称；共产党准备担负起它在这种大联合中的责任，以加强被法西斯分子陷于危险中的共和政体。
