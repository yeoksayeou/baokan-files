    【Other News】After the An Guo civilian labor corps gloriously returned upon completing its mission, the county authorities held a celebration meeting on October 19th for the 257 meritorious individuals who had distinguished themselves. At the meeting, Corps Leader Du reported on the expedition, saying: "We went to 46 counties, climbed mountains and crossed rivers, marched day and night, traveled thousands of miles, and everyone was full of energy, not feeling tired, and not a single one deserted. The army called us the Steel Civilian Labor Corps. Why? Because we overcame all difficulties and completed the tasks assigned to us by our superiors." As he spoke, he asked the civilian laborers below the stage: "Next time, will we still go? Those who are willing to go, raise your hands!" With a bang, the civilian laborers below the stage all raised their hands and shouted: "I'll go, I'll go!" "Fight to Nanjing, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!" "Eliminate Fu Zuoyi! Capture Yan Xishan alive!" The mood at the meeting was extremely high.

    庆功会上齐欢呼：下次支前还要去！
    【又讯】安国民工团完成任务光荣胜利归来后，县各机关于十月十九日给立功的二百五十七个功臣开庆功会。会上杜团长报告远征经过说：“俺走到了四十六县，爬山过河，日夜行军，行程数千里，个个精神饱满，不感到辛苦，没一个逃亡。军队上称我们是钢铁民工团，为什么呢？因为我们克服了一切困难，完成了上级给予我们的任务。”说着，向台下的民工们问道：“下次咱还去，虽愿去举手？”轰一下子，台下民工们都举起了手来喊：“我去，我去！”“打到南京去，活捉蒋介石！”“消灭傅作义！活捉阎锡山！”会场上的情绪异常高涨。
