　　Cultivating Outstanding Elements of the Working Class
  　North China Workers' School Established
    [Our Newspaper] To cultivate outstanding elements from the working class and increase the number of working-class backbones in new democratic state organs and state-owned enterprises, the North China Workers' School, established in the North China Liberated Area, has been formally founded. The first phase of student enrollment will tentatively admit 300 students. The school will use the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism to enhance the proletarian consciousness and political and ideological level of the students. The curriculum includes five courses: workers' movement, a brief history of social development, new democracy, the Chinese Communist Party, and current affairs and politics. For those with particularly low levels of education, appropriate supplementary cultural education will be provided. Active members among skilled or semi-skilled modern industrial workers, or cadres with work experience in trade unions, will be transferred from the various enterprises under the Transportation Department, Enterprise Department, and Bank of the North China People's Government, as well as from the various public enterprises in Shijiazhuang, to study at the school. Admission will be subject to a certain examination. The duration of the study period is set at four to six months. Students will receive a salary during their studies, paid by the school at 75 to 80 percent of their original salary, and their families will continue to enjoy the welfare benefits of their original enterprise departments.
