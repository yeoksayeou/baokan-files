Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 6th: The latest issue of the Communist Information Bureau's organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy," was published in Bucharest on November 1st. This issue is a special commemorative issue for the 31st anniversary of the October Revolution, filled with essays written by leaders of Communist Parties from various countries for this great anniversary. The essay by Comrade Mao Zedong, leader of the Chinese Communist Party, is also published in this issue. These essays are overflowing with the spirit of proletarian internationalism and filled with confidence that the democratic camp worldwide has the strength to thoroughly defeat the international imperialist new war plans. The following is a summary of these essays as issued by Telepress:

　　Dimitrov (leader of the Bulgarian Workers' Party) wrote that if the bosses of Wall Street attempt to launch a new war, this war will end in the complete destruction of capitalism. Imperialist elements are plotting war mania for the sake of exclusively possessing capitalist interests. They cannot disturb peace for long, because there is a powerful Soviet Union, new democratic countries, and a constantly growing international democratic peace camp.

　　Piek (leader of the German Socialist Unity Party), in his article, discussed the Soviet army's defeat of the Hitler fascist bandits and the establishment of conditions for Germany's democratic development. He expressed gratitude on behalf of the German democratic forces.

　　Thorez (leader of the French Communist Party) reaffirmed in his article that the French people will not oppose the Soviet Union, and they will never do so.

　　Bierut (leader of the Polish Workers' Party) wrote that almost no country's development has been unaffected by the great October Revolution. In 1918 and 1945, peoples of all nationalities were liberated with the help of the October Revolution's strength.

　　Gottwald (leader of the Czechoslovak Communist Party) wrote that without the great October Revolution, there would be no independent Czechoslovakia. If it were not for the alliance with the Soviet Union and its fraternal help, Czechoslovakia would not have been able to escape Hitler's occupation and would not have been able to withstand the pressure of Western imperialism. Czechs and Slovaks would once again become oppressed people.

　　Pauker (leader of the Romanian Communist Party) pointed out that the people liberated from the chains of imperialism, along with the Soviet Union, the new democratic countries, democratic China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and others, now account for more than a quarter of the world's total population. Such powerful strength can only be achieved under the banner of international socialism.

　　Togliatti (leader of the Italian Communist Party) said that the enemy is reorganizing its forces. Facing the advance of socialism, they are planning to resort to war once again. The imperialist victors and their followers will repeat the adventures of Hitler and Mussolini. But we feel ourselves ten thousand times stronger than before, and the hysterical cries of the imperialist elements and social democratic leaders are a sign of their increasing weakness. Their doomsday is approaching.

　　Pollitt (leader of the British Communist Party) believes that every aspect of the imperialist crisis is concentrated in Britain, the oldest capitalist country in the world. Britain is also a typical country where right-wing social democracy is at work. The Labor government has not led to socialism, but to the blatant protection of monopoly capitalism, infringing on the wages of the working class, and providing record profits for capitalism. The sacrifices made by the people in the anti-fascist war have been betrayed, and the Third World War is being prepared. The British working class will see a country with a persistent and developing crisis of their tycoons, landlords, and profiteers, in sharp contrast to the Soviet Union. Pollitt, on behalf of the class-conscious workers of Britain, declared that socialism is the only way out and that bankrupt social democracy must be opposed and defeated.

　　The journal's editorial wrote that the Soviet Union has gloriously recovered after the Second World War. The industrial output in September has exceeded the level of 1940 by 26 percent, and the grain harvest has reached the pre-war level, while the yield per hectare has even exceeded the pre-war level. The reason this is possible is entirely due to the unprecedented increase in productivity under the socialist economy. The people of the new democratic countries are aware of the enormous assistance that the Soviet Union provides to their countries every day. They know that without the heroic Soviet army, they would not have been able to achieve national independence and build a free life. The editorial also stated that miserable traitors like the nationalist Tito have been condemned by the fraternal communist parties. Traitors cannot change the course of social development, and the advance of society will bury the betrayers in the dustbin of history.

### 情报局刊物出版纪念十月革命专号　各国共产党领袖撰文  洋溢着无产阶级国际主义的精神

　　情报局刊物出版纪念十月革命专号
  　各国共产党领袖撰文       
    洋溢着无产阶级国际主义的精神
    【新华社陕北六日电】共产党情报局机关刊物“争取持久和平与人民民主”的最近一期于十一月一日在布加勒斯特出版。这一期是十月革命三十一周年的纪念专号，满载着各国共产党领袖为这一伟大的纪念日所撰写的论文，中共领袖毛泽东同志的论文也刊载在该期上。这些论文洋溢着无产阶级国际主义的精神，并充满着对全世界民主阵营有力量彻底击败国际帝国主义新战争计划之信心。电通社所发关于这些论文的摘要如下：
    季米特洛夫（保加利亚工人党领袖）著文称，华尔街的老板们若图发动新战争，则这一战争将以资本主义的完全毁灭告终。帝国主义分子为了独占资本主义的利益策动战争狂，他们不可能长久扰乱和平，因为有着强大的苏联、新民主国家和不断长大的国际民主和平阵营。
    皮克（德国统一社会党领袖）的文章论及苏联军队之击败希特勒法西斯匪帮并建立了德国民主发展的条件，他代表德国民主力量表示感谢。
    多列士（法共领袖）的文章，重申法国人民不会反对苏联，他们决不这样做。
    贝鲁特（波兰工人党领袖）写道，几乎没有一个国家的发展不受伟大十月革命的影响。在一九一八年和一九四五年，都有各族人民借助于十月革命的力量获得了解放。
    哥特瓦尔德（捷共领袖）写道，若无伟大的十月革命，也不会有独立的捷克。若不是与苏联缔结同盟，得到它兄弟般的帮助，捷克就解脱不了希特勒的占领，就不会抵挡得了西方帝国主义的压力。捷克及斯洛伐克人会再一次地变成被压迫的人民。
    波克夫人（罗共领袖）指出，从帝国主义锁链下解放出来了的人民和苏联、新民主国家、民主中国、朝鲜人民共和国及其他等等，现在已占全世界总人口的四分之一以上。这样强大的力量，只有在国际社会主义的旗帜下，才有可能达到。
    托格里亚蒂（意共领袖）称，敌人正在重整旗鼓。他们面对着社会主义的挺进，计划再一次诉诸战争。帝国主义战胜者及他们的徒众将重复希特勒和墨索里尼的冒险。但我们感到我们自己比以前强壮十万倍，而帝国主义分子和社会民主党领袖们的歇斯底里的叫嚣，则是他们日益衰弱的表现。他们的末日已经接近。
    波立特（英共领袖）认为，帝国主义危机的每一方面，都集中在英国这个世界上最老的资本主义国家。英国也是右翼社会民主主义起作用的典型国家。工党政府没有导向社会主义，却导向了公然地保护独占资本主义，侵害工人阶级的工资，为资本主义提供创纪录的利润。人民在反法西斯战争中所付出的牺牲被叛卖了，第三次世界大战却在准备中。英国工人阶级将看到他们大亨们、地主们和投机发财者的具有持续不已和继续发展的危机的国家，而与苏联恰成尖锐对照。波立特代表英国有阶级觉悟的工人宣称，社会主义是唯一的出路，必须反对和击败破产的社会民主主义。
    该刊的社论写道，苏联在第二次大战后已光辉的恢复了。九月份的工业产量已超过一九四○年水平的百分之二十六，谷物的收获量亦达战前水平，而每公顷的产量还超过战前。所以有这种可能，完全是因为在社会主义经济下生产力空前的提高。新民主国家的人民，意识到苏联每天给予他们国家的巨大援助。他们知道，若无英勇的苏联军队，他们就会不能取得民族独立和建立自由的生活。社论又称，象民族主义者铁托这样可悲的叛徒，已为各兄弟共产党所谴责。叛徒改变不了社会发展的进程，社会的前进将把背叛分子埋葬于历史的垃圾堆中。
