　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: The Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) in Budapest reports: Mrs. Joliot-Curie, Secretary of the World Democratic Women's Federation, recently met with reporters here and stated that one of the main tasks of the Democratic Women's Federation Congress, scheduled to be held in Budapest from December 1st to 6th, will be to express the anti-imperialist warmongering stance of 100 million women. Women must play an important role in guarding peace. Those who suffered the most in the last war will use every means to prevent their brothers, husbands, and sons from sacrificing themselves again for the profits of monopoly capitalists.
