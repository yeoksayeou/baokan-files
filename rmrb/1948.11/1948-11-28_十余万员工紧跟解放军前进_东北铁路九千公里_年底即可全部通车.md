Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 25th: For more than a year, with the victorious advance of the Northeast People's Liberation Army to liberate the entire Northeast, the Northeast Railway has been approaching the stage of full restoration and opening to traffic thanks to the efforts of more than 100,000 railway employees. "Wherever the People's Liberation Army fights, the railway will be repaired!" This is the resounding slogan put forward by more than 100,000 railway employees in Northeast China since the People's Liberation Army launched the summer offensive last year. At the beginning of last year's summer offensive, the total length of railways open to traffic in the Northeast Liberated Area was 4,951.1 kilometers. With the victorious progress of our army, it had increased to more than 6,000 kilometers by the end of last December. The railways recovered during the winter offensive have also been fully restored during the spring and summer of this year. After the start of the autumn offensive to liberate the entire Northeast, the employees worked even harder, and the railways were quickly restored and opened to traffic each time a region was liberated. As of now, more than 70% of the railways recovered in the autumn offensive have been completely open, and the remaining sections are being repaired day and night. Coupled with the new lines built by the democratic government in the past two years, it is estimated that by the end of this year, the total length of railways in Northeast China will reach 9,000 kilometers.

The entire Northeast railway network is under the jurisdiction of four sub-bureaus under the Northeast Railway Administration. In North Manchuria, the main railways open to traffic are: Binzhou (Harbin - Manzhouli), Binbei (Harbin - Bei'an), Hasui (Harbin - Mudanjiang - Suifenhe), Binchang (Harbin - Changchun), Labin (Harbin - Lafa), Suijia (Suihua - Jiamusi), Qibei (Qiqihar - Bei'an), Ningnen (Ningnian Station - Nenjiang on the Qibei Line), etc., winding through the famous granary area of Northeast China, which is rich in soybeans, sorghum, and corn, and connecting important cities such as Harbin, Mudanjiang, Qiqihar, and Jiamusi. In East Manchuria, the main routes are: Mujia (Mudanjiang - Jiamusi), Lindong (Linkou - Dong'an), Mutu (Mudanjiang - Tumen), Tuchang (Tumen - Dunhua - Jilin - Changchun), etc., running through the nationally famous forest area and passing through famous coal mines such as Hegang and Jixi. In West Manchuria, the main routes are: Qiping (Qiqihar - Baichengzi - Zhengjiatun - Siping), Baichang (Baichengzi - Changchun), Baia (Baichengzi - Arxan), Datong (Zhengjiatun - Tongliao - Xinlitun - Dahushan), Liaore (Yixian - Yebaishou - Chifeng), etc. Along the line, in addition to the rich production of grain and famous coal mines such as Beipiao and Fuxin, there are also famous agricultural and pastoral areas, producing large quantities of fur, livestock, and medicinal materials. In South Manchuria, the main lines that have been opened to traffic are: Sili (Siping - Xi'an - Tonghua - Lian), Tonglin (Tonghua - Linjiang), Jihai (Yongji - Hailong), Shenhai (Hailong - Meihekou - near Fushun), Anxi (Andong - Benxi), the southern section of the Zhongchang Line (Siping - Tieling - Shenyang - Liaoyang - Anshan - Wafangdian - Pulandian, branch line Dashiqiao - Yingkou), etc., distributed in the central area of Northeast China's heavy industry. Along the line, in addition to famous industrial cities such as Shenyang, Xi'an, Fushun, Benxi, and Anshan, there are also rich plain areas, producing large quantities of cotton, flax, silk, fruits, and coastal fish and salt.

All the railways that have been opened to traffic have not only smoothly transported industrial products and local specialties from various places, but more importantly, they have directly and powerfully supported the front lines. The train departure times on each line are accurate, and passenger and freight transportation is also improving day by day. The people of Northeast China generally praise that the railways managed by the democratic government have surpassed any period in the history of Northeast China in many aspects. In the future, in addition to continuing to improve operations, each line will also train a large number of cadres to help with the transportation construction in the liberated areas within the customs.

　　十余万员工紧跟解放军前进
  　东北铁路九千公里  年底即可全部通车
    【新华社哈尔滨廿五日电】一年多以来，随着东北人民解放军的胜利进攻到解放全东北，东北铁路在十余万铁路员工的努力抢修下，已接近全部修复通车的阶段。“解放军打到哪里，铁路就抢修到哪里！”这是东北十余万铁路员工自去年人民解放军发动夏季攻势以后所提出的响亮口号。去年夏季攻势开始时，全东北解放区通车的铁路线计有四千九百五十一点一公里。随着我军的胜利进展，至去年十二月底止，已增加至六千余公里。冬季攻势中收复的铁路，在今年春夏两季间亦已全部修复。此次解放全东北的秋季攻势开始后，员工们更加努力，每解放一个地区，铁路即迅速修复通车。截至目前止，秋季攻势中所收复的铁路已有百分之七十以上完全畅通，其余若干处正日夜抢修中，加上民主政府两年来所添筑的新线在内，预计至本年底，东北全境铁路线将达九千公里。
    整个东北铁路网，在东北铁路总局下，设四个分局管辖。在北满方面：其主要通车钱路有：滨洲（哈尔滨——满洲里）、滨北（哈尔滨——北安）、哈绥（哈尔滨——牡丹江——绥芬河）、滨长（哈尔滨——长春）、拉滨（哈尔滨——拉法）、绥佳（绥化——佳木斯）、齐北（齐齐哈尔——北安）、宁嫩（齐北线宁年站--嫩江）等线，蜿蜒于盛产大豆、高粱、玉米的东北有名的谷仓地区，并连结着哈尔滨、牡丹江、齐齐哈尔、佳木斯等重要城市。东满方面：主要路线有：牡佳（牡丹江——佳木斯）、林东（林口——东安）、牡图（牡丹江——图们）、图长（图们——敦化——吉林——长春）等线，贯穿于著名全国的森林地带，并经过鹤岗，鸡西等著名煤矿。西满方面：主要路线有：齐平（齐齐哈尔——白城子——郑家屯——四平）、白长（白城子——长春）、白阿（白城子——阿尔山）、大通（郑家屯——通辽——新立屯——大虎山）、辽热（义县——叶柏寿——赤峰）等，沿线除盛产粮食及北票、阜新等著名煤矿外，并有著名之农牧区，大宗出产皮毛、牲畜、药材等。南满方面：已通车的主要线路有：四里（四平——西安——通化——里安）、通临（通化——临江）、吉海（永吉——海龙）、沈海（海龙——梅河口——抚顺附近）、安溪（安东——本溪）、中长南段（四平——铁岭——沈阳——辽阳——鞍山——瓦房店——普兰店，支线大石桥——营口）等线，网布于东北重工业中心地区。沿线除有沈阳、西安、抚顺、本溪、鞍山等著名工业城市外，并有富饶之平原区，大宗出产棉花、亚麻、蚕丝，果品，及沿海之鱼盐等。
    所有已畅通的铁路，不但舒畅地运销了各地工业品及地方特产，更重要的是直接有力的支援了前线。各线开车时间准确，客货运亦日趋改进。东北人民普遍称誉民主政府管理的铁路有许多方面已超过了东北有史以来的任何时期。今后各线除继续提高业务外，并大量培养干部，以帮助关内解放区的交通建设。
