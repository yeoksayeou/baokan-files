Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, October 30th: TASS Moscow, October 28th: Stalin's answer to "Pravda" reporter's questions, original text as follows:

Question: What is your opinion on the results of the Security Council's discussion of the Berlin situation and the behavior of the US, British, and French representatives in this matter?

Answer: I believe these events demonstrate the aggressive nature of the US, British, and French ruling groups' policies.

Question: Is it true that an agreement was reached between the four countries on the Berlin issue in August of this year?

Answer: Yes, it is true. As everyone knows, on August 30th of this year, the representatives of the four countries, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, reached an agreement in Moscow, namely: on the one hand, lifting transport restrictions, and on the other hand, using the German Mark of the Soviet occupation zone as the sole currency in Berlin, both measures to be implemented simultaneously. This agreement does not harm the prestige of any party, it takes into account the interests of all parties concerned, and guarantees the possibility of further cooperation. However, the United States and British governments rejected their representatives in Moscow and declared the agreement invalid. That is to say, they decided to submit the Berlin issue to the Security Council, where the US and Britain could guarantee a majority, thereby violating the agreement.

Question: Is it true that during the recent discussions on the Berlin issue in the Paris Security Council, even before the Security Council voted on the issue, an agreement was reached on the Berlin situation in informal talks?

Answer: Yes, it is true. The President of the Security Council, the Argentine representative Bramuglia, who represented other countries in informal talks with Comrade Vyshinsky, did indeed have a draft resolution on the Berlin situation agreed upon by all parties. However, the US and British representatives once again declared the agreement invalid.

Question: So, what's going on? Can you explain it?

Answer: The thing is this: those in the United States and Britain who advocate aggressive policies do not care about reaching agreements with the Soviet Union or cooperating with the Soviet Union. What they want is not agreement and cooperation, but to talk about agreement and cooperation, while hindering agreement, thereby blaming the Soviet Union, and thus "proving" that cooperation with the Soviet Union is impossible. The war instigators who are trying to launch a new war are most afraid of reaching agreements and cooperation with the Soviet Union, because a policy of harmony and unity with the Soviet Union undermines the position of the war instigators and deprives those gentlemen's aggressive policies of any purpose. For this reason, they sabotage agreements that have already been reached, reject representatives who have already drafted such agreements with the Soviet Union, and violate the UN Charter by submitting issues to the Security Council where they can guarantee a majority and arbitrarily "prove" anything. All of these actions are to "show" that it is impossible to cooperate with the Soviet Union, to "show" the necessity of a new war, thereby preparing the ground for the launching of a war. The current policies of the leaders of the United States and Britain are aggressive policies, policies of launching a new war.

Question: How should one view the actions of the representatives of the six Security Council members – China, Canada, Belgium, Argentina, Colombia, and Syria?

Answer: These gentlemen are clearly supporting aggressive policies, supporting policies of launching a new war.

Question: What could be the result of all this?

Answer: The result can only be the shameful failure of the instigators of a new war. Churchill, the main instigator of a new war, has already managed to lose the trust of his own people and the democratic forces of the world. The same fate awaits all other war instigators. The people of all countries still have vivid memories of the horrors of the last war. The power of the peace-loving masses of the people is so strong against the Churchill disciples who are carrying out aggression that they cannot overcome this power and cannot turn this power towards a new war.

    主张和平的人民大众力量强大美英发动新战争的政策必失败
    【新华社陕北三十日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日电：斯大林答真理报记者问，原文如下：
    问：对于安理会讨论柏林形势问题的结果和美英法代表在这件事情上的行为，你的看法如何？
    答：我认为这些事情表现了美英法统治集团政策的侵略性。
    问：今年八月，四国间曾在柏林问题上获得协议，此事是否确实？
    答：是的，是确实的。大家知道，今年八月三十日，苏、美、英、法四国代表，在莫斯科获得协议，即：一方面取消运输限制，另一方面以苏联占领区的德国马克为柏林的唯一货币，这两项措施同时实施。这一协议并不损害任何一方的威信，它照顾到有关各方的利益，并保证着进一步合作的可能性。但是，美国和英国政府批驳了它们在莫斯科的代表，并宣告这一协议无效。这就是说，它们决定将柏林问题提交美英方面可以保证得到多数的安理会，从而违反了协议。
    问：在巴黎安理会最近讨论柏林问题的时期中，甚至在安理会对这问题举行表决以前，关于柏林形势曾在非正式会谈中获得协议，此事是否确实？
    答：是的，是确实的。代表其他的国家与维辛斯基同志作非正式会谈的安理会主席、阿根廷代表布拉玛葛里亚确实有一个经各方协议的柏林形势问题决定草案在他手上。但是，美国和英国代表又再次宣告该协议无效。
    问：那么，这是怎么一回事呢？你能加以说明吗？
    答：事情是这样的：美英两国那些鼓吹侵略政策的人们，并不关怀他们与苏联取得协议，和与苏联合作。他们所要的不是协议与合作，而是谈论协议与合作，而又阻挠协议，借此责备苏联，从而“证明”与苏联合作是不可能的。正在力图发动一次新战争的战争鼓动者，他们所害怕的首先就是与苏联达成协议与合作，因为与苏联和谐一致的政策有损于战争鼓舞者的地位，使那些绅士们的侵略政策丧失任何目的。为此之故，他们就破坏业已达成的各项协议，批驳他们业与苏联一道草成这种协议的代表，并违反联合国宪章，把问题提交给他们保证可以得到多数、且能任意“证明”任何事情的安理会。这一切作法都是为了“表明”不可能与苏联合作，“表明”有新战争的必要，从而为战争的发动准备根据。美英两国当前领袖们的政策，就是侵略的政策，发动新战争的政策。
    问：对于安理会六个理事国——中、加、比、阿（根廷）、哥（伦比亚）、叙（利亚）——代表们的所为，应作如何看法？
    答：这些绅士们显然正在支持侵略的政策、支持发动新战争的政策。
    问：这一切的结果可能是什么呢？
    答：其结果只能是新战争鼓动者的可耻的失败。邱吉尔这个新战争的主要鼓动者，业已做到了使自己丧失其本国人民及全世界民主力量对他的信任。同一命运等待着其他的一切战争鼓动者。上次战争的惨象，各国人民的记忆犹新。主张和平的人民大众的力量，对进行侵略的邱吉尔门徒们来说是如此的强大，他们战胜不了这种力量，不能将这种力量转向新的战争去。
