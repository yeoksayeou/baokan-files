　　US Progressive Party National Committee Resolution
  　Demands End to Aid to Chiang
  　Resumption of Negotiations with the Soviet Union
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 21st: TASS reports: The National Committee of the US Progressive Party held its second plenary session in Chicago from the 12th to the 14th. The plenary session passed a resolution demanding an end to aid to Chiang Kai-shek and other reactionary governments. The resolution pointed out: "The bipartisan policy supports Chiang Kai-shek's corrupt dictatorship with US taxpayers' money. This completely rotten warlord system is collapsing under the dissatisfaction of the Chinese people." The resolution demanded "reopening negotiations with the Soviet Union to seek a peaceful Germany and Europe as the only way to end the Cold War worldwide." The resolution called for the abolition of the conscription law, reduction of military spending, and the use of military spending for domestic facilities to benefit American families. The resolution stated that the exchange of letters between Wallace and Stalin in May "rekindled the desire for peace in a world of darkness and terror." The resolution, after listing the failures of bipartisan foreign policy in China, Greece, Spain, and Palestine, stated that this policy "is facing serious tests all over the world." The resolution lashed out: "The real rulers of American foreign policy are still the military and Wall Street bankers, who are forming a Western European military alliance and rebuilding German industry as its arsenal. They are touting tens of billions of dollars for lend-lease bills to equip Europe. They are fully arming the United States with a military budget far exceeding the 15 billion dollars proposed by Truman himself. They are transferring the funds urgently needed for education, housing, healthcare, and security into the pockets of war contractors." In addition to enacting peacetime conscription laws, the war makers "have drafted a comprehensive security police system centered on the armed forces based on Nazi blueprints." Truman's promised domestic reforms are in conflict with the plans of the war makers everywhere. Therefore, the struggle for peace and progress is indivisible. The resolution finally firmly stated: "We use peaceful methods to create the most favorable conditions for progress and maintaining domestic freedom. The Progressive Party is willing to be a crusader dedicated to the cause of peace." The plenary session also passed the Progressive Party's legislative program. In addition to the issues already covered in the aforementioned resolution, the program also calls for: the repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act, the implementation of measures to control inflation, the improvement of living standards with "the excessive profits of today's companies," the implementation of rent control, the enactment of anti-poll tax laws and anti-lynching laws, the abolition of the Un-American Activities Committee, the defeat of the Mundt-Nixon Bill, the elimination of slums within ten years, and the implementation of a rural housing construction plan. This program will be submitted by Progressive Party Senator Taylor and Congressman Marcantonio to the Senate and House of Representatives of the new Congress to be convened in January next year.

　　美进步党全委会决议
  　要求停止援蒋
  　并与苏联重开谈判
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社报导：美国进步党全国委员会自十二日至十四日在芝加哥举行第二次全会。全会通过决议：要求停止援助蒋介石与其他反动政府。决议指出：“两党政策以美国纳税人的金钱支持蒋介石腐败的独裁，这种完全朽烂的军阀制度在中国人民的不满打击下，正在崩溃中。”决议要求“与苏联重开谈判，寻求一个和平的德国与欧洲，作为结束世界范围内冷战的唯一道路”。决议要求废除征兵法，缩减军费，把军费用于内政设施以造福于美国的各个家庭。决议称：五月间华莱士与斯大林的交换函电，是“在黑暗与恐怖的世界中重新燃起了和平的愿望”。决议在列举两党外交政策在中国、希腊、西班牙、巴勒斯坦执行的失败结果后称：这一政策“正在全世界各地面临严重的考验”。决议痛斥：“美国外交政策的真正统治者，仍旧是军人与华尔街银行家，他们正在缔订西欧军事联盟，并重建德国工业以为其军火库。他们正为数十亿元装备欧洲的租借法案而大肆宣传。他们以远超过杜鲁门自己所提出的一百五十亿元军事预算的数目来使美国全副武装。他们将教育、住宅、保健与安全所急需的款项转入到战争承办人的腰包里去”。战争制造者们除了制定和平时期的征兵法外，“又根据纳粹的蓝本草拟了以武装部队为中心的全面保安警察制度”。杜鲁门所许诺的内政改革，到处都和战争制造者的计划发生冲突。因此，争取和平与进步的斗争是不可分割的。决议最后坚决表示：“我们用争取和平的方法，为进步与保持国内自由建立最有利的条件。进步党愿为献身于和平事业的十字军。”全会并通过进步党立法纲领。纲领内容除上述决议所已涉及者外，并要求：废除塔夫脱——哈特莱法，实施管制通货膨胀措施，以“今天各公司的过分利润”来提高生活水平，实施房租管制，制定反人头税法与反对虐杀黑人法，取消非美活动委员会，击败蒙特——尼克逊法案，在十年内肃清贫民窟，实施建筑农村房屋计划。该纲领将由进步党参议员泰勒与众议员马肯托尼奥分别向明年一月召开的新国会参众两院提出。
