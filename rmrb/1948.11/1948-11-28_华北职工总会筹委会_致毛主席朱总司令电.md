　　Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions
　　Telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu

　　Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:
　　Under your leadership, the workers of North China have braved hardships and dangers, fought bravely, and obtained a free life, and have become masters of their own factories, land, and country. This is primarily due to your wise leadership and the arduous battles of the People's Liberation Army. Here, we extend our class's highest respect to you.

　　Now, in order to adapt to the needs of the unified situation in North China, we established the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions on October 23rd, calling on all workers in North China to, under the leadership of their class's vanguard—the Chinese Communist Party—and yourselves, diligently study, improve technology, increase production, and support the front lines. With the unity of our class, we will unite all the people of North China, cooperate with the People's Liberation Army, victoriously, cleanly, and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek-Fu Zuoyi bandit troops, in order to quickly overthrow the American imperialist lackey, Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang government, and establish an independent, free, and happy New China.
