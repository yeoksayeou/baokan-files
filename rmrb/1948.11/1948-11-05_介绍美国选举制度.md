    Introduction to the American Electoral System
            What positions are being elected this year?
    This year, November 2nd, is the American general election day that occurs once every four years. According to the American Constitution, this election will involve the reelection of the President and Vice President, who serve four-year terms, all 435 members of the House of Representatives, who serve two-year terms, and one-third of the 96 Senators, who serve six-year terms.
    The President is produced by each party's national convention nominating presidential candidates, and then each party nominates its "presidential elector" candidates in each state. What voters directly vote for on election day is not actually the President and Vice President, but the "electors." The number of "electors" is equal to the sum of the senators and representatives of each state, totaling 531 nationwide. These "electors," after being elected, elect the President and Vice President in the state capitals in December, and the votes are counted in Congress in early January of the following year. But in reality, as long as a party obtains more than half of the "electoral" votes (i.e., 266 votes) on election day, the winner of the presidency is completely determined.
    The election of representatives is determined by Congress based on the population of each state. New York State has the largest population and can elect 45 representatives. Each state elects two senators. The election methods for senators and representatives are generally that political parties nominate candidates, who are directly elected by participating voters.
            The Fraud of the "Two-Party System"
    For a century, American elections have been manipulated by the Republican and Democratic parties. These two parties, through their vast and corrupt "party machines" spread across the country, control the nomination of candidates and the conduct of elections, excluding the participation of new parties in the election. The "party machines" of the two parties in each state and county are mostly held by the loyal lackeys of a few big capitalists, the so-called "party bosses." These party bosses engage in bribery, patronage, and forging ballots in elections. They can make people who have been dead for a long time and people who never existed on earth vote for them. It is well known that Truman's rise as a senator was the result of the Kansas City Democratic Party boss, the gangster Pendergast, sending him to the Senate as a flunky in 1934. Truman received a total of 40,000 votes that year. But his district actually only had 25,000 eligible voters, and the remaining 15,000 votes were "copied votes" from Pendergast's pocket. This method of manipulating elections is called the "boss system" or the "invisible government" by Americans. In addition, there is a shameless system in American electoral politics called the "spoils system." The central slogan of this system is "To the victor belongs the spoils." This means that when a party's candidate is elected president or governor, other administrative positions are completely replaced, and are protected by the party. According to this system, after the new president is elected, in order to reward the party bosses, the lucrative position of Postmaster General is often offered to the chairman of the party's national committee.
    Such is the true content of the "two-party system," described by American bourgeois agents as a "sound democratic way."
    In order to make the two-party competition seem like a real event, the big capitalists often donate equal amounts of money to the Democratic Party and the Republican Party as their campaign expenses. As the saying goes, "He who pays the piper calls the tune." The so-called "two-party system" is just a deceptive puppet show played by the big capitalists. Lenin, in analyzing the wonders of the American two-party system, said: "Since the emancipation of the black slaves, the differences between the two parties have become increasingly blurred. This struggle has no meaning for the people. The people are blinded by the symbols and empty duels of these two bourgeois parties and ignore their own vital interests. The so-called two-party system is one of the most ingenious methods of preventing the rise of a working-class party."
            American-style "Democracy"
    The American Constitution stipulates that citizens over the age of twenty-one have the right to vote. In reality, this is just a piece of paper. Because each state has various restrictions on voter qualifications. Seventeen states in the United States stipulate that only those who can read and write English have the right to vote. This deprives two million adult illiterates of the right to vote. Seven southern states also have poll tax regulations, that is, each person must pay a poll tax of one to three dollars per year to have voter status. This prevents a large number of blacks and poor whites in the South from participating in elections. Under the barbaric racial discrimination system, the few blacks who participate in elections are either killed or insulted. Only one-tenth of the blacks, who account for one-tenth of the total population of the United States, are eligible to participate in elections.
    Due to various restrictions and voters' indifference to the two-party competition, the proportion of voters participating in elections in the United States is very low in each general election. For example, in 1940, only 49 million of the 80 million voters actually voted. In 1944, the voters who participated in the election accounted for only 55 percent of the total voters. In the midterm elections of 1946, only 38 percent of the voters participated. And among these voters who participate in elections, they are deceived daily by thousands of newspapers and thousands of radio stations, and cannot make independent choices.
            A Progressive Choice
    This year's American election is greatly different from the past in one respect. That is, the chains of the "two-party system" that monopolized elections have been broken by the establishment of a third party - the Progressive Party. The American people can be free from the shackles of the two-party system and elect candidates from the Progressive Party who represent their own interests. Although various states have stipulated various restrictions on the emergence of third parties and imposed various persecutions and insults on the members of the Progressive Party, the Progressive Party, which is full of new vitality, has finally broken through many obstacles and obtained the qualifications to participate in the election in 45 states. The Progressive Party is today an organization representing a broad united front of American workers, farmers, progressive intellectuals, and small and medium-sized capitalists. It has a clear policy of international peace and cooperation and a domestic policy of democracy and freedom. It gives the American people the opportunity to choose a progressive political party in this election. Under the political pressure of the American reactionaries and the slander of almost all reactionary newspapers and radio stations, people cannot expect the American Progressive Party to achieve a decisive victory in this election, but it can be predicted that it will win millions of votes in this election and attract millions of people who were indifferent to the election in the past to participate in voting, thereby laying a solid foundation for its future development.

### 介绍美国选举制度

    介绍美国选举制度
            今年选举些什么人
    今年十一月二日，是美国四年一次的大选日。依照美国宪法，这次应改选的是任期四年的总统与副总统、任期二年的众议员全体四三五名和任期几年的九十六名参议员的三分之一。
    总统的产生是先由各党全国代表大会提出总统候选人，然后各党再在各州提出它的“总统选举人”候选人。选民在大选那天所直接票选的，实际上不是总统及副总统，而是“选举人”。“选举人”的数目等于各州的参众议员的总和，全国共计五三一名，这些“选举人”当选后，于十二月份内在各州首府选举总统和副总统，翌年正月初在国会开票。但实际上，只要某一党在大选之日所得的“选举人”票数超过半数（即二六六票），总统属谁就已完全确定了。
    众议员的选举是由国会根据各州人口的多寡来确定其应出的席位。纽约州人口最多，可选众议员四十五名。参议员则每州皆选二人。参众议员选举的方法，一般均系由政党提出候选人，由参加的选民直接投票选举。
            “两党制度”的骗局
    百年以来，美国的选举即操纵在共和与民主两党的手中。这两党通过其遍布全国庞大而腐败的“党机器”，控制着候选人的提名和选举的进行，排斥新党的参加竞选。两党在各州县的“党机器”，大多是握在少数大资本家的忠实走狗所谓“党魁”的手里。这些党魁们在选举中从事卖官鬻爵、贿赂包办和伪造选票等舞弊行为他们能使死去很久和地球上根本没有过的人为他们投票。尽人皆知，杜鲁门之能以参议员起家，就是堪萨斯城民主党党魁、流氓彭德加斯特于一九三四年把他当作小喽罗送到参院去的结果。杜鲁门那年共获四万张选票。但他的选区实际上仅有二万五千人有选举权，其余一万五千票就是彭氏荷包里的“抄票”。这种操纵选举的办法，美国人称之为“党魁制度”，又叫作“无形政府”。此外，美国选举政治中还有一种无耻的制度，称为“分赃制度”。这一制度的中心口号是“赃物归胜利者所有”。这就是说：当某一党的候选人当选为总统州长之后，其他的行政官职就“一朝天子一朝臣”地完全换掉，改由该党包庇。根据这种制度，新总统在当选后，为了酬谢党魁，邮政总长的肥缺常是被奉送给该党的全国委员会主席。
    被美国资产阶级代理人描写为“健全民主方式”的“两党制度”，其真实的内容就是如此。
    大资本家们为了使两党竞选闹得象煞有介事，常常以数目相等的金元，一笔捐给民主党，一笔捐给共和党，作为它们的竞选费用。俗话说：“出钱的老爷点戏。”所谓“两党制度”，只是大资本家们所玩弄的一种骗人木偶戏而已。列宁在分析美国两党制的妙用时曾说：“自从黑奴解放以来，两党的区别已日益模糊。这个斗争对于人民没有任何意义。人民被这两个资产阶级政党的象征与空虚的决斗所蒙蔽而忽视了自己的切身利益。所谓两党制度，是阻止工人阶级政党崛起的最巧妙方法之一。”
            美国式的“民主”
    美国宪法规定年满二十一岁的公民都有选举权。实际上，这只是一纸具文。因为各州对选民资格均规定有种种限制。美国现有十七个州规定，只有能读能写英语的，才有选举权。这就使得二百万成年文盲被拨夺了选举权。南方七个州还有人头税的规定，即每人每年要缴纳一元至三元的人头税，才有选民人格。这就使得南方大量的黑人及穷苦白人无加选举。在野蛮的种族岐视制度下，少数参加选举的黑人，不是受到杀害，就是受到侮辱。占美国总人口十分之一的黑人，只有十分之一有资格能参加选举。
    由于各种限制和选民对两党竞选的冷淡，美国历次大选中参加选举的选民的比例很低。例如一九四○年，八千万选民中实际投票者仅四千九百万人。一九四四年参加选举的选民，只占全体选民的百分之五十五。一九四六年的中期选举，参加选民仅为百分之三十八，而在这些参加选举的选民中，他们又是天天在成千种报纸和成千座广播台的欺骗下，不能作自主的选择。
            进步的选择
    今年美国的选举，有一点是和过去大大不同的。这就是独占选举的“两党制度”的铁链，已因第三党——进步党的成立而被冲破。美国人民可以不受两党制度的束缚，而选举代表他们自己利益的进步党的候选人。虽然美国各州都订有种种限制第三党出现的规定，并对进步党人员横施种种迫害与侮辱，但富有新生命力的进步党，终于打破了许多阻碍，在四十五州取得了参加竞选的资格。进步党今天是代表美国工人、农民、进步知识分子和中小资本家的广泛的统一战线的组织。它有明白的国际和平合作政策和民主自由的对内政策。它使美国人民在这次选举中有了选择进步政党的机会。在美国反动派的政治高压和几乎全体反动报纸及广播的造谣中伤下，人们虽不能期望美国进步党能在这次选举中取得决定性的胜利，但可以预卜的是：它在这次选举中必将赢得成百万张选票并吸引成百万往年对选举抱冷淡态度的人去参加投票，从而为它今后的发展奠定坚固的基础。
