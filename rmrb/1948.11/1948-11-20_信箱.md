　　Comrade Huang Wu:
    You asked, after land ownership is determined, what to do when retired veterans return home. In preparation for settling retired veterans, the village can appropriately reserve a portion of land. This reserved land can be temporarily cultivated by poor farmers, without rent, only paying taxes.

　　Su Tingzi, Liù Qū (Sixth District), Huòlù County:
    You overpaid public grain last year, and it is still stored in the village. It can be used to offset this year's public grain. To ensure clear accounting procedures, you can negotiate with the finance and grain cadres and request an allocation.

　　Comrade Guo Qing'en:
    Your letter and a copy of the materials have been received. The self-criticism from Ping Shan's First District is indeed somewhat shallow, but we believe it is not necessary to publish it again. Because the return address was not clear, we were unable to reply by letter.

　　Zhang Beichen, Zhengtai Coal Mining Company:
    You suggested that North China should establish a correspondence school to solve the learning difficulties of on-the-job cadres and out-of-school youth. We have forwarded this to the Education Department of the North China People's Government for research.

　　Zhang Fan, Dacheng County:
    The situation you reflected regarding autumn public grain in the Qingxian Ninth District area has been forwarded to the Finance Department of the North China Government for research.

　　Feng Qinghua, Cishan Station, Guanshe Road:
    You asked about the difference in treatment between the supply system and the salary system. Please refer to the "Questions and Answers" column in the People's Daily on October 7th.

　　信箱黄武同志：
    你问权确定后，有荣退军人回家时怎办。为准备安置荣退军人，村中可适当留出一部分土地，此项留地可暂由贫苦农民耕种，不出租金，只纳负担。获鹿六区苏亭子君：
    你去年涨交了公粮，尚在村中保存，可顶今年公粮，为使帐目手续清楚可与财粮干部交涉，请求拨兑。郭庆恩同志：
    来信与材料一份均收到，平山一区的检讨，确实有些不深刻，但我们认为不必再登载了因来信地址不详，未能去信作复。正太煤矿公司张北辰君：
    你建议华北应设立函授学校，以解决在职干部与失学青年的学习困难，我们已转华北人民政府教育部研究。大城县张帆君：
    你所反映青县九区一带秋季公粮之情况，已转华北政府财政部研究。馆涉路磁山站冯庆华君：
    你问供给制与薪金制的区别和待遇，可参看人民日报十月七日询问与答复栏。
