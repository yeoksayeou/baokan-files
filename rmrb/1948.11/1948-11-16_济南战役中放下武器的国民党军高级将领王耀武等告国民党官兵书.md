To all officers and soldiers of the Nationalist forces:

　　Yaowu and others, due to political ignorance and a lack of understanding of domestic and international trends, stubbornly held onto Shandong, vainly attempting to survive. How could we have known that a war against the people would inevitably lead to widespread betrayal and ultimate demise? Recent examples such as the battles of Zibo, Changwei, and Yanzhou, despite thorough preparations, all resulted in complete annihilation and successive defeats. These are concrete proofs and certainly not accidental phenomena. Taking the Battle of Jinan as an example, we gathered over 100,000 well-equipped troops, a considerable force. We constructed multiple lines of deep fortifications, solid defenses. Our reserves of grain, ammunition, and supplies were sufficient for a major campaign, and our resources were abundant. However, because officers and soldiers abhorred the civil war and their morale was low, and because the lenient policy of the People's Liberation Army had deeply penetrated the hearts of the soldiers, even without Wu Huawen's uprising, it would have only delayed the inevitable fate of complete annihilation.

　　Yaowu and others bore military and political responsibility and thought that after liberation, we would certainly suffer humiliation. However, after meeting with leaders of the East China Military Region and other commanders, their words and attitudes were extremely sincere, and in terms of living conditions, we received preferential treatment. Moreover, they understood and forgave the crimes committed by Yaowu and others in the past due to errors in political understanding, and did not hold us accountable for the past. The Chinese Communist Party is consistent in word and deed, and there is absolutely no deception. As for the tens of thousands of officers and soldiers who were liberated, all were treated with a lenient policy. Those who wished to stay were accommodated, and those who wished to leave were sent away, with appropriate and reasonable arrangements made for each. In particular, for the families of the soldiers, those who wished to stay were settled, and those who wished to leave were given travel expenses. This made Yaowu and others feel infinitely grateful after receiving such kindness. Therefore, we dare to recount our experiences and offer a word of advice. You are not intentionally violating the people, but are merely being forced by circumstances, deceived by Chiang Kai-shek, and used as tools by the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen families. Who is truly for the nation and the people? You should distinguish between right and wrong, assess the advantages and disadvantages, accelerate your political awakening, and enhance your political understanding. Either revolt on the battlefield, or withdraw from the civil war as soon as possible. Even if you are forced by circumstances and cannot be independent, we hope that you will lay down your arms in time and not engage in hopeless resistance, resulting in unnecessary sacrifice. By shortening the duration of the civil war and reducing the suffering of the people, you will be pulling back from the precipice before it is too late; serving the people and achieving your ambitions. As the saying goes, "He who understands the times is a hero; he who is ignorant of opportunities is not wise." What to do and where to go, we hope you will choose for yourselves. We humbly present our views and respectfully request your consideration.

　　济南战役中放下武器的国民党军高级将领王耀武等告国民党官兵书国民党各部队官兵均鉴：
    耀武等于政治无知，不明国内外之趋势，负隅山东，妄图荀全，岂知反人民之战争，终必众叛亲离，招致最后灭亡之命运。近如淄博、昌潍、兖州诸役，虽均有充分准备，亦终全部被歼，先后失守。此皆具体事实之证明，确非偶然之现象。更以济南之战而言，集结装备优良之部队十万以上，兵力不为不大，构筑纵深据点之数带阵地，工事不为不坚，粮秣弹药之储存，足敷会战之用，物资不为不丰。乃因官兵厌恶内战，斗志消沉，解放军宽大政策，深入军心，纵无吴化文之起义，亦不过稍延时日，势难挽回全歼之命运。
    耀武等身负军政责任，自忖解放以后，必遭凌辱。乃至华东军区与各首长晤谈，其言语态度，俱极诚恳，生活方面，备受优待。且对耀武等过去因政治认识之错误而造成之罪行，并予谅解，不咎既往。中共言行一致，决非欺骗。至于被解放之数万官兵，俱本宽大政策，愿留者收容，愿去者欢送，分别予以合情合理之处置。尤其对于军人眷属，愿留者安置，愿去者资遣，更使耀武等受惠之余，感愧无穷。用敢缕陈经过，并献一言。君等实非有意违反人民，不过因环境所迫，致受蒋介石之欺骗，而为蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族之工具。究竟谁为国家民族？君等当明辨是非，审度利害，加速政治觉悟，提高政治认识。或于战场起义，或早日退出内战，纵属迫于环境，无法自主，亦望及时放下武器，不作绝望之抵抗，致遭无谓之牺牲。由是缩短内战之时日，减少人民之灾难，则君等勒马悬崖，尚非为晚；为民立功，有志竟成。语云：识时务者为俊杰，昧先机者非明哲，何去何从，愿君等自择。谨布区区，敬祈鉴纳。
