    The North China Bureau, the North China Government, and the Military Region
    Send a Congratulatory Message on the Success of the Northeast Liberation War
    Believing that the Liberation of All of North China Will Follow
    [Report from this newspaper] The North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the North China People's Government, and the North China Military Region jointly sent a telegram to Comrades Lin Biao, Luo Ronghuan, Gao Gang, and Chen Yun, and all comrades of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, congratulating them on the recovery of Shenyang. The telegram stated:
    "The recovery of Shenyang marks the great success of the Northeast Liberation War. The good news has greatly inspired the military and civilians of North China. Soon the People's Liberation Armies of the Northeast and North China will fight side by side on the North China battlefield to finally eliminate the remnant Chiang and Fu bandit troops in the north. We believe that the liberation of the entire North China will surely follow closely on the heels of the liberation of the Northeast, and the day of national victory will be greatly accelerated. We extend our warm greetings and condolences!"
