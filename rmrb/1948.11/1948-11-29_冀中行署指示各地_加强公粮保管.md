　　Jizhong Administrative Office Directs All Areas to Strengthen Public Grain Storage

　　[Jizhong Electric] In order to strengthen the storage of public grain, most villages in Jizhong had organizations of storage committees in the past, and some played a significant role in the storage of public grain. However, many areas failed to earnestly improve this organization, resulting in constant losses, spoilage, theft, unauthorized use, and borrowing of public grain. During this year's collection, the Jizhong Administrative Office, in order to properly store public grain, specifically instructed all areas: All villages storing public grain must establish public grain storage committees, those that already exist should be strengthened, and those that do not exist should be re-established. Grain storage landlords and neighbors should be organized into storage groups to jointly take responsibility and form a mass storage effort. The village storage committee organization should generally include major cadres and absorb three or four people who are responsible, enthusiastic, and experienced in storing public grain. The storage committee should establish meeting, reporting, and inspection systems, and be led by governments and grain depots at all levels. Governments and grain depots at all levels should strengthen their leadership over the village storage committees, solve their difficulties, and promptly reward those who have contributed to storage; those who are not responsible should be criticized.

　　冀中行署指示各地
  　加强公粮保管
    【冀中电】为了加强公粮保管，过去冀中一般村庄均有保管委员会的组织，有的且在保管公粮上起了不小作用。但很多地区未能认真健全这一组织，因而公粮损失、糜烂、偷盗动支、挪借等事，不断发生。今年征收当中，冀中行署为把公粮保管好，特指示各地：凡存有公粮村庄都要建立公粮保管委员会，过去已有者要加强，没有的要重新建立起来。存粮房东与四邻要编成保管小组，共同负责，形成群众性的保管。村保管委员会组织，一般要有主要干部参加，并吸收对保管公粮负责热心有经验的三、四人组成。保委会要建立会议、汇报、检查制度，受各级政府与粮库领导。各级政府与粮库对村保委会要加强领导，解决其困难，及时检查对保管有功者应进行奖励；不负责者进行批评。
