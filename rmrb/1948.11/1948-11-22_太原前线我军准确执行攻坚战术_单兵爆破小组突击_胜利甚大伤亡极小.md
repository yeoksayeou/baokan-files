[Taiyuan Front Dispatch] Our army on the Taiyuan front has accurately implemented the guiding ideology of siege tactics: "Firepower cover, single-soldier demolition, squad assault." In the battles on the outskirts of Taiyuan, we have already achieved brilliant examples of great victories with minimal or even zero casualties. On the morning of October 9th at 10:00 AM, the Third Company of a certain unit of our army received the task of capturing the enemy's North Camp Northwest Beiyang Cement Pillbox. The company commander ordered the first platoon to take the main assault. The platoon leader clearly assigned the tasks: Squad One for demolition, Squad Two for assault. Squad Leader Gěng Làcái led a group, using machine-gun firepower to block the enemy's gun ports. At the start of the battle, they first used three mortars and four heavy machine guns to suppress the enemy outside the fort, forcing them inside. Then they bombarded the enemy fort. Each machine gun was paired with two rifles, targeting one enemy gun port (a total of ten gun ports), making it impossible for the enemy to raise their heads. At that moment, Jin Haiyu, a demolition soldier from Squad One, took the opportunity to rush forward alone to plant explosives. However, it only destroyed the outer moat and was unsuccessful. Then they organized a second demolition. Jin Haiyu again ran up alone with explosives and finally collapsed the enemy's large cloverleaf pillbox. Squads One and Two immediately used half their strength to rush up and throw grenades. The enemy immediately surrendered. The battle was resolved in just forty-five minutes. In this operation, a total of twenty-eight enemies were captured, two were killed, one heavy machine gun, two light machine guns, two light cannons, and eleven rifles were seized. We suffered no casualties.

On October 10th, the Sixth Company of a certain unit of our army used the same tactics to eliminate the 218th Regiment, 3rd Battalion of the enemy's 73rd Division at Wusu Airport. During our army's attack, they first meticulously organized firepower, using concentrated and dense artillery fire to block, suppress, and destroy the enemy's firing points and fortifications, covering several three-person demolition squads and an assault squad. After six consecutive single-soldier demolitions, the enemy's battalion headquarters, a large temple, and a cement cloverleaf pillbox were blown to smithereens in twenty minutes, and the enemy's battalion commander and deputy battalion commander were captured alive. At midnight, they still used this method to capture the enemy's last pillbox. At 12:00 PM on the morning of the 11th, under our army's military pressure and political offensive, three hundred enemies who had stubbornly defended twenty-six cement main pillboxes and many small cement pillboxes at Wusu all laid down their weapons, while only four of our comrades suffered minor injuries. In the previous two battles, the First Platoon and the Sixth Company had successfully completed their tasks. The First Regiment Committee approved a collective merit award for the First Platoon and issued a circular commending them. The First Regiment Committee also awarded the Sixth Company a banner with the words "Created a Model of Single Soldier Demolition - Daring Hero." The common resolve of all comrades in the Sixth Company of a certain unit is: "No matter how fierce the enemy's attack, we must resolutely charge and use our wisdom." In the Nanpan battle, under the close coordination of infantry and artillery, they used dispersed formations to cross the open ground, break through the gap, and occupy the forward position without any casualties. When developing in depth, the Fifth Company rushed up, like a sharp knife, straight into the middle of the enemy's three defensive strong points, in front of the high pillbox where the enemy's regimental headquarters was located. Three young heroes (the oldest being nineteen years old), Liu Jiagui, Ke Maofeng, and Ma Yujin, successively completed four forced demolition missions. The third time, they not only destroyed the enemy's high pillbox but also blew up the enemy's regimental headquarters command post, quickly and completely annihilating the enemy together with fraternal units. When the Second Battalion of a certain unit cooperated in the battle to annihilate the enemy at Nanheiyao, it also captured more than two hundred enemies alive, with only two comrades suffering minor injuries, due to the close coordination of firepower cover, single-soldier demolition, and small-group movements. In the Xiaodian battle of a certain unit, when the "Assault Squad" of the Second Squad of the Eighth Company calmly passed through the enemy's blockade for the first time, Deputy Squad Leader Zhang Fengxian directed the entire squad to move forward individually, with greater distance and faster movements. But when they were about to reach the village, they had to pass through an east-west road, where the enemy's blockade was tight. Zhang Fengxian waved his hand and directed everyone to leap forward, and the entire squad passed through the enemy's second line of fire blockade. During the assault, he divided the entire squad into triangular formations and charged. A burst of grenades drove the enemy in the pillbox down, and they continued to develop in depth, smoothly completing the assault and annihilation tasks. From the beginning to the end of the battle, only one comrade was injured. The entire squad of six people captured fifty prisoners and seized many guns.

[Taiyuan Front Dispatch] In the battle of our army on the Taiyuan Front to capture the enemy's pillbox fortifications in Nanheiyao on the eastern mountains of Taiyuan and annihilate the Third Regiment of Yan's 72nd Division, we adopted small-group siege operations that closely combined demolition groups and combat groups. Because the soldiers were skilled, brave, and firepower cover was proper, twenty-three consecutive demolitions were carried out, with twenty-one successes and no casualties. In this battle, the unit did not have specialized engineers to cooperate. As long as they encountered enemy buildings or bunkers, demolition soldiers would automatically scramble to undertake the demolition tasks. Wang Xixiu, a soldier from the Second Company, Liu Jiagui, the deputy squad leader from the Fifth Company, Wang Houpin, the squad leader of the Sixth Squad from the Sixth Company, and Zhang Zhikuan, a soldier, all automatically undertook to carry out three or more consecutive demolitions. Wang Shengfu, a liberation soldier from Linfen in the Second Company, did not ignite the explosives in the first two demolitions. The third time, the squad leader did not let him go, but Wang said: "I have not completed my task yet." He immediately carried the explosives and rushed over, finally detonating the target designated by the superior. The demolition group of the Sixth Squad of the Sixth Company was divided into two groups, upper and lower, on the battlefield. They planned that if the upper group did not complete the task, the next group would follow closely. When they entered the battle, they checked the explosives and detonators. The two groups successively detonated the enemy's outer firing points, blew down the outer walls and the enemy's bunkers, and made an enemy battalion headquarters dizzy. Squad Leader Wang Houpin led the entire squad to rush up and eliminate the enemy in the battalion headquarters. Liu Jiagui's demolition group of the Fifth Company completed eight demolition tasks in a row. The activities of the demolition group were closely combined with the actions of the assault group. When Liu Jiagui's group demolished the large square pillbox of the enemy's regimental headquarters, the shrapnel and brick fragments had not completely fallen down, and the grenades from Wang Yiming's assault group had already been thrown in from the demolition opening. Immediately after, they rushed up and shouted: "Surrender!" The enemy was frightened by the explosives and only said: "Don't shoot, we surrender!" More than eighty enemies were captured in this way. Comrade Wang Yiming asked: Where is your regimental commander? A prisoner said: "Regimental Commander Liu Shiyuan was blown to death." The enemy's regimental headquarters and two battalion headquarters were completely eliminated by our army's demolition group in conjunction with the assault troops. Another battalion headquarters, under military pressure, combined with shouting, led to the entire surrender. (Huà Mín, Bīng Rú)

　　太原前线我军准确执行攻坚战术
    单兵爆破小组突击
  　胜利甚大伤亡极小
    【太原前线电】太原前线我军许多部队准确执行了“火力掩护、单兵爆破、小组突击”的攻坚战术指导思想，在太原城郊作战中，已获得胜利大、伤亡小、甚至无一伤亡的光辉范例。十月九日上午十时，我军某部三连接受了攻取敌人北营西北北洋灰梅花碉的任务后，令一排担任主攻，该排排长即明确的把工分好，一班爆破，二班突击。班长耿腊财带领一组，火力掩护用机枪封锁住敌人的枪眼。战斗一开始，他们先以三门迫击炮四挺重机枪将堡外敌人压入堡内，接着轰击敌堡，每一挺机枪配合两支步抢，对住敌人一个枪眼（共十个枪眼），把敌人打得抬不起头来时，一班爆破手金海鱼便单人乘机猛扑上去点炸药。但只炸了外壕，没有成功。接着他们便组织二次爆破。金海鱼又单人抱着炸药跑上去，终将敌人梅花碉大碉炸坍，一、二两班即刻各以一半兵力冲上去打手榴弹，敌人马上缴了枪，仅四十五分钟即解决了战斗。这次共俘敌二十八名，炸死二名，缴重机枪一挺，轻机枪两挺，轻炮两门，步枪十一支，我无一伤亡。
    十月十日，我某部六连以同样战法，将武宿飞机场敌人七十三师二一八团第三营消灭。我军攻击时，首先把火力周密的组织好，以集中浓密的炮火，封锁压制摧毁敌人的火力点与工事，掩护着几个三人组成的爆破小组和一个突击班突击，连续来了六次单兵爆破，二十分钟即把敌人营部驻地大庙和一座洋灰梅花碉炸得稀烂，敌人正副营长也被活捉。半夜时候，他们仍用这种办法把敌人最后一座碉堡攻下。十一日上午十二时，在我军军事压力与政治攻势下，固守武宿二十六个洋灰主碉和许多小洋灰碉的敌人共三百个人，全部放下武器，而我们仅有四个同志负轻伤。在上两次战斗中，由一排和六连很好的完成了任务，一团委会批准了给一排立集体功，下通令表扬。一团委并给六连奖了一面旗子，上面写着“创单兵爆破独胆英雄范例”。某部六连全体同志的共同决心是：“不管敌人打得怎么凶，要坚决冲锋，用智谋。”在南畔战斗中，他们在步炮密切配合下，用疏散的队形，冲过开阔地，突破缺口，占领前沿阵地，无一伤亡。在向纵深发展时，五连接上去了，象一把快刀，一直插向敌人三个防御支撑点中间，敌人团部驻地的高碉跟前。刘家贵、克茂风、马玉金三个小英雄（最大的十九岁），连继完成四次强行爆破任务。第三次不但将敌人高碉摧毁，并将敌人团部指挥所炸坍，共同和兄弟部队迅速的全部歼灭了敌人。某部二营配合作战歼灭南黑窑敌人时，也由于火力掩护、单兵爆破、小群动作密切配合，活捉敌人二百多，自己只有两个同志负轻伤。某部小店战斗中，八连二班“突击班”第一次沉着通过敌人的封锁时，副班长张凤先指挥全班各个前进，距离要大，动作要快。但快到村边时，要通过一条东西路，这里敌人封锁严密，张凤先摆着手，指挥大家跃进，全班又通过敌人二道火力封锁。当冲锋时，他把全班分成三角队形冲上去。一阵手榴弹把碉堡敌人打下去，继续纵深发展，顺利的完成了突击和歼敌任务。他们从战斗开始到结束，仅有一个同志负伤。全班六个人捉了五十个俘虏，还缴了很多枪支。
    【太原前线电】太原前线我军某部于太原东山攻取南黑窑敌碉堡工事，歼阎匪七十二师第三团战斗中，采用爆破组与战斗组紧密结合的小群攻坚作战，由于战士们动作熟练、勇猛，火力掩护得当，连续爆破二十三次，成功二十一次，无一伤亡。此次战斗中该部没有专门工兵配合，只要碰到敌人楼房地堡，爆破员就自动抢着担任爆破任务。二连战士王熙修，五连副班长刘家贵，六连六班长王候品，战士张志宽等，都自动担负连续爆破三次以上。二连临汾解放战士王胜福，二次爆破没拉响火，到第三次班长不让他去，王说：“我还没有完成任务哩。”他马上扛着炸药冲过去，终于爆炸开了上级所指定的目标。六连六班爆破组，在战场上分为上下两组，他们计划上组完不成任务，下一组紧跟上去。他们进入战斗把炸药雷管都作了检查，两个组先后爆炸了敌人外沿火力点，炸垮了外墙和敌人的地堡，把敌一个营部炸得昏头转向，班长王候品就带着全班冲上去解决了营部敌人。五连刘家贵的爆破组，一连完成八次爆破任务。爆破组的活动，都与突击组的动作紧密结合着，刘家贵小组爆破敌团部指挥所大方碉时，碎石砖片还未全部落下来，王义明突击组的手榴弹，就已经从爆破口中投进去了。紧接着冲上去喊叫：“缴枪！”敌人被炸药吓呆了，只说：“不要打，我们缴枪！”有八十多个敌人就这样当了俘虏。王义明同志问：你们团长呢？一个俘虏说：“刘士元团长被炸死了。”敌人的一个团部和两个营部，完全是由我军爆破组结合突击部队消灭的。另一个营部在军事压力下，结合喊话，带领全部投诚了。（化民、冰如）
