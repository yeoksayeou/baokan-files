　　Paying attention to protect livestock during wartime mobilization
    In order to support the war, transportation is busy everywhere. Wartime service leadership organs in various places should pay attention to the fact that livestock should not be mobilized haphazardly without a plan due to the busy support, causing damage to foals and mother animals. For example, in the Lingqiu Third District, with the task of transporting ×10,000 catties of grain, the Logistics Department of the county ordered the Third District to arrange it on the 12th and deliver it to a certain county on the 14th. In order to complete the urgent task, this is certainly correct; however, due to the lack of planning and distinction, regardless of whether they were mother animals, foals, or calves, they were mobilized together. As a result, a cow in Shangyewo Village and a donkey in Nanliang Village dropped their offspring on the way, almost costing the lives of the mother animals. In E'yachuan Village, a cow that had just calved a few days earlier was also mobilized, and the calf at home had no milk to eat for two days and almost starved to death. Also, the hooves of the cattle in Sanhedi Village were damaged during transportation and have not healed to this day, which has delayed autumn plowing. Due to the lack of careful planning, livestock have been so severely damaged. If attention is not paid to overcome this and it continues, the number of livestock will decrease day by day, which will create greater difficulties for wartime support transportation and production. The leadership in Lingqiu should conduct inspections and resolutely correct this in the future. All localities should also pay attention to protecting and rewarding the breeding of livestock, which is even more important for future wartime support and production.

### 战勤动员中　注意保护牲畜

　　战勤动员中
  　注意保护牲畜
    为了支援战争，各地运输繁忙，各地战勤领导机关应注意：不能因支前繁忙无计划的乱动员畜力，致使小驹和母畜受到损害。如灵邱三区在运粮×万斤的任务下，该县后勤部命令三区，十二号布置，十四号就要送到某县。为了完成紧急任务，这当然是对的；但因无计划无分别不管母畜、小驹、小犊一齐动员的结果，使上野窝村的一个母牛、南梁村的一个母驴，都在半道上落了驹，差一点没把母畜致命。鹅鸭川村有一刚下犊不多几天的母牛，也动员了去，小犊在家两天没乳吃，差一点饿死。还有三合地村的牛，去驼运，坏了蹄子，至今未好，秋耕也误了。由于工作缺乏周密的计划，而使牲畜这样严重地受到损害，如不加注意克服，仍继续下去，畜力就会一天一天的减少，这对支前运输及生产等工作就会增加更大困难。灵邱领导上应该进行检查，今后坚决纠正。各地也应注意保护，奖励繁殖牲畜，这对今后支前生产是更为重要的。
