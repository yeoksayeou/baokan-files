Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: The eastern part of Gansu divides the Northwest into two worlds. To the east is the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and eastward from there to the vast lands of the Bohai and Yellow Seas, all belong to the new democratic China. The regions to the west, north, and south remain under the rule of ancient, dark, feudal forces. According to an article in the Nanjing *Shiji Pinglun* (Century Review), Vol. 4, No. 8, entitled "Two Matters in Lanzhou," Zhang Zhizhong, the head of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the Northwest, admitted that "under the current land system, poor peasants, farm laborers, and tenant farmers are generally so poor that they do not even have a place to stand." The land irrigated by the Huanghui Canal near Lanzhou, which the Kuomintang government designated as a "land reform demonstration" area, has 46 percent of its land controlled by seven large landlords who engage in feudal exploitation. Feudal exploitation, like a venomous snake, is strangling the working people everywhere in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of Gansu. According to an article in the pro-Kuomintang *Xinlu Zhoukan* (New Road Weekly) of Peiping entitled "Hexi—A Peasant's Hell," 90 percent of the poor peasants in Hexi are suffering from the cruel exploitation of 10 percent of the landlords and rich peasants. Rampant usury is an important form of exploitation. The prevalent usurious loans in the area include five types: grain loans, advance grain, advance labor, cooperative farming, and wool shearing. The lightest is "grain loans," where one *dou* is borrowed in the spring and two *dou* are repaid in the autumn. The more severe is "advance grain," where rich peasants pre-purchase the autumn harvest of poor peasants at extremely low prices when food is scarce. In May of this year, the market price of one old *dou* (approximately three market *dou*) of wheat in the area was 3 million yuan, while the price of "advance grain" was generally only 700,000 yuan. In other words, the 700,000 yuan a poor peasant borrowed at this time could only buy a little over two *sheng* of wheat from the rich peasant, but after the autumn harvest, they would have to repay one *dou* to the rich peasant. The principal and interest amounted to approximately 4.3 times the original amount. There are two common sayings in Hexi: one is "After using the *gunzi* (threshing tool), the *zengzi* (grain container) is sold"; the other is "Wolves are not to be feared, tigers are not to be feared, but the bill collector's shout makes one stand askew." The article cites a survey of a village in Shandan County, Hexi: The village has more than 130 households. During the period of food scarcity in June of this year, only 11 or 12 households could eat their fill. The majority of the remaining households were hanging on to life with a small amount of grain and a large amount of wild grass. This is still the situation in a relatively wealthy village in a relatively wealthy county in the area. In other places, large numbers of people are starving to death. In Yongchang, Shandan, Minle, and other counties, there are very many peasants who are forced to sell their children due to hunger.

    甘肃蒋区农民困苦受着地富残酷剥削
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】甘肃的东部分开了西北的两个世界，在这以东是陕甘宁边区，由此往东直到渤海和黄海的广大土地，都属于新民主的中国。在这以西、以北和以南地区，仍然在古老的黑暗的封建势力统治下。据南京世纪评论四卷八期“兰州二事”一文中称：国民党反动派在西北的首脑张治中承认：在现在的土地制度下，一般贫农雇农佃农均贫无立锥。兰州附近湟惠渠灌溉的土地，是国民党政府作为“土地改革示范”区的，有百分之四十六的土地掌握在七家大地主手中，进行封建剥削。封建剥削在甘肃国民党统治区内，毒蛇般地到处绞缠着劳动人民。据亲国民党的北平新路周刊“河西——农民的地狱”一文报导：河西百分之九十的贫苦农民，受着百分之十的地主富农的残酷剥削。猖獗的高利贷，是重要的剥削形式。该区流行的高利贷，有借粮、支粮、支工、合种、剪毛五种。较轻的是春借一斗秋还二斗的“借粮”。较重的是“支粮”，即青黄不接的时候，富农以极低的代价预购了贫农的秋收。今年五月间，该区一老斗（约三市斗）小麦的市价为三百万元，而“支粮”的价格一般仅为七十万元。换言之，贫农这时候借得的七十万元，只能在富农处购得小麦二升多，在秋收后便要还富农一斗。本利约达原本的四点三倍。河西有两句俗语，一句是“住了滚子（打场用具），卖了甑了（装粮用具）”；后一句是“狼不怕，虎不怕，帐主张喊一声斜站下”。该文引河西山丹县一个村落的调查：该村拥有一百三十多户人家。今年六月间青黄不接的时候，只有十一、二户人家能吃饱肚子，其余大多数人家靠着少量的谷物和大量的野草，吊着一口断不了气的命。这还是该区比较富裕的县份中而又比较富裕的村落的情形，其他地方则饿死了大量的人。永昌、山丹、民乐等数县在饥饿中被迫出卖孩子的农民非常之多。
