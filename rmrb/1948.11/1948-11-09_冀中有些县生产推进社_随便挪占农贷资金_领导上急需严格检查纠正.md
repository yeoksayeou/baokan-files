[Hebei Central Electric] Production promotion cooperatives in various counties of Central Hebei have achieved preliminary results in enterprise-oriented operation and management in some counties, while others are doing poorly and urgently need improvement and strengthening. The Wuqi Production Promotion Cooperative has transferred out five unnecessary production units one after another, concentrating manpower and resources on promoting the sale of native cloth and transferring livestock. It has exchanged native cloth for livestock in Hunyuan, Quyang, and other places. From this spring to the end of September, it has transported livestock twelve times, exporting 10,080 bolts of native cloth and exchanging for 115 head of livestock. This has greatly promoted and organized agricultural and sideline production for farmers. The Gaoyang Production Promotion Cooperative pays more attention to the recovery and turnover of agricultural loans. This autumn, it centrally issued 200 million yuan in wheat planting loans in one go, exceeding about one-half of the wheat planting loans in general counties, greatly promoting the expansion of wheat planting. However, some county production promotion cooperatives arbitrarily occupy agricultural loan funds and cannot lend them out in time, affecting the support of mass production. For example, the Anping Production Promotion Cooperative once took more than 90 million yuan of agricultural loan funds to sell rice, and the Anguo Production Promotion Cooperative's iron factory occupied 230 million yuan. The iron factory in Suning also held up 70 million yuan. Other counties such as Boye, Li County, and Xinle have also occupied some agricultural loan funds for other productions, which cannot be withdrawn to this day, affecting the support of agricultural production. On the other hand, the loans that have been issued cannot be recovered on time, affecting the turnover of funds. For example, after the loans were issued in Xinle, Wuqi, and other counties, no one took the initiative to recover the loans when they were due. According to the statistics of six counties including Shenze and Ding County, by the end of September, 176.52 million yuan of loans should have been recovered, but only 59.3 million yuan was actually recovered, accounting for only one-third of the amount that should have been recovered. When the Suning Production Promotion Cooperative took over the county store, the total amount of grain, raw cotton, and saltpeter loans issued in the 36th year of the Republic of China, as well as outstanding sales debts, totaled more than 150 million yuan, which has not yet been cleared. There are also county-level organs or individuals who have misappropriated, used, or defaulted on production funds. For example, the Suning County Government, Logistics Department, Political Department, and other organs owe more than 5.9 million yuan. In May, the Anxin Promotion Cooperative transferred a pharmacy to the county government for operation. At that time, the price was more than 95.9 million yuan, which has been delayed until now. Some cadres of organs in Qingyuan County have misappropriated more than 5 million yuan of the Promotion Cooperative's funds. In addition, the governments of Anping and other counties have violated the administrative office's instructions that "the property of the Promotion Cooperative shall not be used by anyone," and have instead taken back some of the property of the original county store that had been returned to the Promotion Cooperative. In addition, some county production promotion cooperatives still retain the operating methods of organ stores, are divorced from farmers' production, and use some funds for unnecessary businesses. For example, the Anping Production Promotion Cooperative once transferred out retail sales, but not long ago, it was engaged in the wholesale of rice, porcelain, and other items. The leather factory in Anguo, the bookstore in Xinle, and the towel factory in Anping are all continuing to operate. The production promotion cooperatives are engaged in these businesses, which have little effect on driving mass production, and it is also urgent to change industries and concentrate their efforts on going deep into the countryside to support mass production.

　　冀中有些县生产推进社
    随便挪占农贷资金
  　领导上急需严格检查纠正
    【冀中电】冀中各县生产推进社在企业化的经营和管理上，有些县已获初步成绩，部分县做的还很差，急需改进与加强。无极生产推进社，把五个不必要的生产单位已先后转出去，集中人力、资力从事推销土布、调运牲口等业务，到浑源、曲阳等地以土布换回牲口。从今春到九月底共调运十二次，输出土布一万零八十匹，换回牲口一百一十五头。这对农民的农、副业生产都有很大组织推动作用。高阳生产推进社比较注意农贷的收回周转工作，今秋一次即集中发放种麦贷款两亿元，超过一般县份种麦贷款的二分之一左右，大大推动了扩大种麦工作。但有些县生产推进社随便占用农贷基金，不能及时贷出，影响扶植群众生产。如安平生产推进社，曾拿九千多万农贷款去贩大米，安国生产推进社的铁工厂就占用两亿三千万元，肃宁也被铁工厂压住七千万元，其他博野、蠡县、新乐等县都为搞别的生产占用着一部农贷款，至今抽不出来，影响扶植农业生产。另方面，已贷出的不能按期收回，影响资金的周转。如新乐、无极等县发下贷款后，到期根本没人去做收回工作。据深泽、定县等六个县的统计，到九月底应收回贷款一万七千六百五十二万元，实收回五千九百三十万元，仅占应收回数的三分之一。肃宁生产推进社在接收县商店时，有卅六年度贷出的谷子、皮棉、火硝贷款及销货外欠等总计达一亿五千多万元，至今尚未清理。还有县级机关或个人挪借、动用、拖欠着生产资金者。如肃宁县政府、后勤部、政治处等机关欠款即达五百九十多万元。安新推进社在五月间把一所药铺转给县政府经营，当时合价九千五百九十多万元，已拖延至今未还。清苑县有些机关干部挪借推进社款项达五百多万元。此外，安平等县政府竟违背行署规定的“推进社财产，任何人不能动用”的指示，反把原来县商店已归推进社的财产现又收回一部。另外有的县生产推进社仍残留着机关商店的经营作法，与农民生产脱节，把一部资金用在不必要的业务上。如安平生产推进社一度将门市销费转出，但不久前又经营大米、瓷器等的批发。安国的革厂，新乐的书店，安平的毛巾工厂等都在继续经营，生产推进社搞这些业务，对带动群众生产的作用不大，亦急需转业，集中力量深入农村扶植群众生产。
