[Jizhong Electric] The militia in the marginal areas of Qingyuan County have continuously killed and wounded Chiang bandits who came to harass from Baoding. The militia in Baituan, Biyangcheng and other villages 20 miles south of Baoding, repelled three attacks by enemies 39 times their strength in ten days, and created a brilliant record of one to one hundred. On October 16, two battalions of the Liu Huanan bandit troops of the Provisional 32nd Division of the New 2nd Army of the Chiang bandits in Baoding went to Biyangcheng, Dabaituan, Zhongran, Xiguzhuang and other villages to rob grain. When they reached about half a mile east of Biyangcheng Village, three of them were killed by the village militia. In the afternoon, the enemy used two battalions to surround the village in three routes, and another twelve were killed or wounded by the militia. On the morning of October 22, a regiment of the enemy's Provisional 32nd Division launched a surprise attack on these villages, and was resisted by militia from various places. After fierce fighting for about ten hours, 43 enemies were killed or wounded. Finally, the enemy concentrated all its strength to attack the northwest corner of Dabaituan Village, and bombarded the militia bunkers with artillery, but the militia had extremely high morale. While defending the high-rise bunkers, they also maneuvered to the streets, using grenades to kill and wound six enemies and destroy one enemy machine gun. On the 24th, the Liu Huanan bandits again attacked Dabaituan with two companies, and another 56 were killed or wounded by the militia. In the afternoon, a regiment and two other battalions of the enemy, under the cover of several machine guns, gradually destroyed the militia's tunnel bunkers from west to east along the street, and bombarded the village with five mortars. The militia moved from the house to the tunnel, and from the tunnel to the house, maneuvering flexibly and stubbornly resisting the enemy. Village cadre Li Jiexian killed or wounded six bandits by himself. County cadre An Daya also killed or wounded nine bandits successively. Militia member Liu Luohei was so tired that he vomited blood, but still stubbornly persisted. Yang Jinqing and Yang Daosheng worked from morning until sunset. Zhang Baoer, who was fifteen years old, peered through the dark gun hole. When the enemy approached, he pulled a landmine and killed two bandits. The battle lasted until 10 p.m., killing and wounding a total of 103 enemies. In the three battles, the enemy suffered more than 200 casualties, while the militia suffered only one wounded and one dead.

[Jizhong Electric] On October 30, when more than 130 Fu bandit cavalrymen (the previous report mistakenly stated 40 or 50) were fleeing eastward, the militia in Dingxian, Anguo, Qingyuan and other places rose up to kill the enemy. On the morning of that day, Wu Ruiqi, secretary of the Tenth District Committee, and Yang Dazhong, secretary of the Dongwangxi Village branch, led five or six militiamen to fight the enemy cavalry and captured a war horse alive. Li Jingzhi, another member of the district committee in the district, and Wang Jianqi, the village chief of Quanchiu Village, led six militiamen from the village and wounded an enemy horse, obtaining six backpacks and more than 300 bullets. At that time, a certain unit of our army stationed in Beiwang Village attacked the enemy, killing two and capturing one alive. Immediately, the enemy's horses scattered and fled. The Beiwang militia captured two, the Xisiwang captured one, and the Xiaozaitun militia killed two. On the same day, when the enemy窜 passed through Anguo County, they were also attacked by our militia everywhere. The Zhangjiaying militia in the county wounded one cavalry and one war horse each, and the Sifuluo militia captured one war horse alive. At that time, the cavalry was scattered again, and Boye Yudi captured five scattered war horses alive. The Qingyuan Zhangdengtun militia captain led the militia to disrupt the cavalry that had fled to the area, obtaining a war horse, a coat, and more than 200 bullets. On the 31st, a group of enemy cavalry invaded Nanjiao from Baoding via Nanxun. When they reached Linshui, the village militia and a certain working team launched a village battle against the enemy. From morning to 4 p.m., the enemy failed to enter the village, killing and wounding more than 20 people, obtaining two 38 guns. The enemy left four dead bodies, one dead horse, and fled in embarrassment. At noon on the same day, another group of enemies invaded Ranzhuang south of Baoding. The village militia fought until 5 p.m. The enemy launched two charges, both of which were repelled. The Ninth Prefectural Committee is preparing to reward the militia for their heroic killing of the enemy. The news of the militia fighting the enemy cavalry and capturing war horses alive has spread everywhere in the villages in this area. The masses are extremely excited, and the militia in each village are ready with their weapons. If the enemy dares to commit crimes again, they are all prepared to show their skills.

[Jizhong Electric] When the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu bandit troops窜 harassed both sides of the Tang River in Dingxian County last month, they committed atrocities of rape, arson, and murder. The masses in the area suffered terribly from the bandits' ravages. In Zhaicheng, Dongshiyi, Xinlizhuang, Luojiazhuang, Xijiazhuang, Lianzhong and other six villages alone, six people were killed and five were wounded by the bandits. Among the three people killed in Xinlizhuang, two were girls. An old lady in Xisiwang was burned alive. Wherever the Fu bandits passed, they rummaged through boxes and cabinets, and seized people and livestock along the way. More than a dozen young adults were seized in Xishiyi and Lianzhong villages, and six livestock were seized in Xishiyi and three horses were seized in Beiwang. The most hateful thing is that women were raped everywhere. A woman in her twenties in Xiwangxi was raped by bandits in Shiliang and could not walk. The masses were extremely angry at the atrocities of the bandits.

    【冀中电】蒋傅匪军上月三十日窜扰定县唐河两岸时，奸淫烧杀，该地群众惨遭匪徒蹂躏。仅翟城、东市邑、新立庄、罗家庄、西家庄、连仲等六村，即被匪杀死六人、打伤五人。新立庄被杀死的三个人，其中有两个女孩。西四旺一个老太太被活活烧死。傅匪所经之地，沿路翻箱倒柜，抓人抢牲口，西市邑、连仲二村均被抓走青壮年十余名，抢去西市邑牲口六匹，抢走北旺马三匹。最可恨的是到处强奸妇女，西王习一个二十多岁的妇女，在士良被匪徒强奸得不能走路。群众对匪徒们的暴行愤恨异常。
