　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd—The various reactionary measures taken by the Kuomintang government after the "currency reform" have brought endless disasters to private industries in its controlled areas. A large number of private industrial factories in Shanghai, including textiles, wool, and rubber products, had already begun to shut down or reduce production by mid-September. According to a report in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on September 24th, industries across Shanghai, including machine weaving, papermaking, paint manufacturing, oil pressing, soap making, leather making, enamelware, and condiments, are all facing the danger of suspension. The report also stated that most of the dyeing and weaving factories in Wuxi, Suzhou, Changzhou, Jiangyin, and Changshu counties have already suspended operations. Because their raw materials are mostly supplied by Shanghai, and the Kuomintang government prohibits merchants from freely purchasing and transporting materials away from Shanghai, they are unable to purchase cotton yarn and dyes. Even more than 3,000 pieces of cotton yarn waiting to be transported or already transported to stations and docks in Shanghai have been detained. In Tianjin, private yarn factories had already significantly reduced or stopped production in September. The Tianjin Ta Kung Pao reported on October 7th that factories such as Beiyang and Hengyuan had further reduced production by 15%; the opening of the Huaxin Yarn Factory was also abnormal. It is said that the price of cotton exceeds the price of yarn by about 100 "gold yuan" per bale, and yarn factories cannot afford the losses.

　　蒋区民间工业遭到无穷灾难
    【新华社陕北二日电】国民党政府“币改”后的种种反动措施，给其统治区内民营工业带来无穷的灾难。上海民间工业纺织、毛绒、橡胶制品等大批工厂于九月中旬即已纷纷停工、减工。据上海大公报九月二十四日消息：全上海市的机织、造纸、造漆、榨油、肥皂、制革、搪瓷、调味等工业，均已面临停工的险境。该报并称：无锡、苏州、常州、江阴、常熟等五县染织布厂，已大部停工。因其原料大都靠上海供应，而国民党政府却禁止商人自由购运物资离沪，致无法买进棉纱及染料。甚至在上海待运或已运到车站、码头的棉纱，也被扣达三千多件。天津民间纱厂，除九月份已大量减工、停工，津大公报十月七日载称：北洋、恒源等厂又减工百分之十五；华新纱厂开工亦不正常。据称棉价超过纱价每包在一百“金圆券”左右，纱厂赔累不起。
