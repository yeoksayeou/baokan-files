　　Fighting for Us
    Lin Shichai
    @Crossing rivers and climbing high mountains,
    Every road, big and small, leads to Taiyuan.
    Militia, laborers, stretcher
    teams,
    Mules carrying public grain form
    a long line.
    The moon is crescent, the stars twinkle,
    The marching troops never
    end.
    Young men carry Type 38 rifles on their shoulders,
    Gleaming bayonets are truly
    dazzling.
    Everyone who sees them cheers,
    Enemies tremble with fear.
    Golden public grain is loaded on
    mules' backs,
    Old men hold whips in their hands.
    Whips crack in the air,
    Wishing they could rush to the front
    line in one step.
    This team is long and long,
    Passing day after day.
    This team comes from afar,
    Traveling nearly a thousand miles.
    "We are from Shunde Prefecture, Hebei,"
    "We are from Pingding County, Shanxi."
    "We turned ourselves around the year before last,
    How can we not support the Liberation
    Army?"
    An old man is fifty-three,
    Leading his mule to the front line.
    He immediately sees the Liberation Army,
    His eyes smile into slits.
    He steps forward to hold a comrade's hand,
    You pull him over from head to toe:
    "My home is in Shouyang County,
    The bandit troops only rolled away last
    October.
    A mule was taken away,
    Three houses were all burned down.
    My son was taken away,
    No news for a year since he left home.
    Cold and hungry, no one cares,
    Endless suffering.
    Since the Liberation Army came,
    My days of suffering are over.
    This time, hearing about attacking Taiyuan,
    Taking the lead to join the war is only right.
    Grab old Yan and avenge our hatred,
    My son and I can finally reunite.
    The feudal roots must be dug out,
    Then peaceful days will last long.
    After taking Taiyuan, attack Beiping,
    Liberate North China and go down the Yangtze River.
    Then I will still join the war,
    Only capturing old Chiang will be the end.
    Remove the feudal roots of the whole country,
    Peaceful and happy for ten thousand years.
    I come to support the Liberation Army,
    The Liberation Army is fighting just for
    us."
    Before he could finish his heartfelt words,
    He was urged to hurry on the road.
    The old man spoke while smoking,
    Raising his whip and heading into the big team.
    Only the crack of the whip is heard,
    Following the marching troops towards
    Taiyuan City.

　　打仗为了俺
    林十柴
    ＠过大河翻高山，
    大路小路都通太原。
    民兵、民工、担架
    队，
    送公粮的毛驴连成
    一条线。
    月儿湾湾星闪闪，
    参战的队伍过不
    完。
    小伙子肩上扛三八，
    晶亮的刺刀真
    耀眼。
    人人看了都喝采，
    敌人见了心胆寒。
    金黄的公粮驴背上
    驮，
    老汉手里拿皮鞭。
    空中皮鞭“叭叭”
    响，
    恨不得一步赶到火
    线上。
    这支队伍长又长，
    过完一天又一天。
    这支队伍来得远，
    走的路程快上千。
    “咱是河北顺德府，”
    “咱是山西平定县。”
    “咱是前年把身翻，
    怎能不来支援解放
    军？”
    一个老汉五十三，
    赶着毛驴上火线。
    一下看见解放军，
    两眼笑成一条线。
    上前拉住同志的手，
    自头到尾你拉个遍：
    “俺家就住寿阳县，
    去年十月匪军才滚
    蛋。
    一头毛驴给拉走，
    三间房子都烧完。
    儿子被抓走，
    离家一年没有信。
    又冷又饿没人管，
    受苦受罪说不完。
    自从来了解放军，
    受罪的日子俺过完。
    这回听说打太原，
    带头参战理当然。
    抓住老阎雪仇恨，
    俺们父子才得团圆。
    封建老根要挖掉，
    安生的日子才长远。
    打完太原打北平，
    解放华北下江南。
    那时俺还要参战，
    捉住老蒋才算完。
    去了全国封建根，
    安生康乐万万年。
    俺来支援解放军，
    解放军打仗就是为
    了咱。”
    知心话儿没拉完，
    后面催他把路赶。
    老汉说吧着烟，
    扬起皮鞭往大队里
    钻。
    只听皮鞭“叭叭”
    响，
    随着大队人马奔向
    太原城。
