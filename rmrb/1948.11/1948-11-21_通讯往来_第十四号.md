Correspondence No. 14
    To the District Party Committees, County and Municipal Committees of all regions:

    Recently, this newspaper has received many work plans, work summaries, and other materials, which have been of great help to the newspaper. In particular, the Jingxing County Committee has continuously provided us with work summaries for this period, summaries of typical villages, and various work plans of the County Committee, enabling this newspaper to have a clearer understanding of the work in the county. This is worth learning by the local, county, and municipal committees. We hope that other organizations will also frequently provide the above-mentioned materials for the newspaper to adopt or study for reference.
