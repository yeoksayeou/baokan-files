Jinnan Third Administrative Office
　　Checks and Urges Collection of Old Loans

[Jinnan Electric Dispatch] In order to ensure that loans are repaid and truly play a role in organizing mass production, the Jinnan Third Administrative Office recently issued a circular urging the collection of old loans, stating: Since the deployment of the work to collect old loans after the wheat harvest, the work of Chengci and Qi counties has been relatively successful, but the work of other counties has not been good enough, and some counties have not even done it at all. The reasons for the inspection are: (1) The main reason is that leading cadres at all levels have a one-sided view of the poor and hired peasants and a point of view of bestowing favors, regarding loans as relief. Therefore, at the beginning of the collection, some counties followed a few masses in demanding that the leadership "be lenient and not collect" or "delay collection." Some cadres also believed that the work of collecting loans was offensive and were unwilling to work hard, adopting a passive and procrastinating attitude. Some even stood between the bank and the masses to mediate, regarding the collection of loans as the bank's business. In addition, some cadres did not clearly understand that the purpose of collecting loans was to further support production, so they were not firm in their implementation. Some districts in Chengci refused to do it under the pretext that "production is currently underway, and collecting loans will affect the morale of the masses." Some districts in Daming and Wei counties, where the floods were very light, also stopped collecting loans under the pretext of flooding. According to a survey in Xishanzhai, Yongnian, only three households in the entire village were unable to repay temporarily, and more than 90% of the households had no major problems in repaying the loans. Because the leadership in the third district of Chengci had a clear attitude and mobilized deeply, it collected all the loans in five days, proving that as long as the leadership is good at enlightening and explaining, so that the masses understand that collecting loans is for the purpose of better supporting production, the masses are willing and fully able to repay the old loans. Therefore, the failure to straighten out the thinking of leading cadres is the most important reason for the failure of the work of collecting loans. (2) In collecting loans, the leaders in some areas did not treat them differently according to the actual situation. For example, those who are old, weak, widowed, and have difficult lives and are unable to repay temporarily must be allowed to repay in installments or in stages. If those who eat, drink, waste, and do not engage in production are not resolutely collected their arrears, honest farmers will not sympathize, and at the same time, the significance of loans to support production will be lost. (3) The deployment was not timely, and the collection of loans missed the agricultural season. According to surveys in various counties, the masses dared to take out loans because they expected to repay them after the wheat harvest. However, some counties delayed the deployment of loan collection until before autumn, the masses had used up their wheat, and the autumn grain had not yet been harvested, so the collection of loans had to fail. In addition, some areas did not collect loans and clear accounts on time, and some households borrowed four or five times, accumulating to tens of thousands of yuan, making it difficult to repay at once. (4) No organization, no preparation. The county warehouse equipment is not sound, no one can identify the quality of the actual collection, and there is no special person to manage the transportation, storage, and various procedures. In the past, loans to villages were not organized in a certain way, and today it is difficult to collect loans, forming an unorganized and leaderless state of loan collection work from top to bottom. Secondly, the masses were not notified early before collecting loans, and the masses were not prepared. As soon as the loan collection started, the cadres immediately demanded payment, and the masses complained that we were forcing payment during the slack season. Except for Chengci and Yongnian, other counties had not notified the masses by the end of September, resulting in the failure to recover some loans that could have been recovered. Based on the above situation, the Third Administrative Office instructed its subordinates to redeploy the collection of loans in conjunction with the land reform and party rectification work, and resolutely implement the policy of fully recovering loans in non-disaster areas, recovering most loans in lightly disaster areas, and recovering some loans in disaster areas. First of all, it is necessary to thoroughly liquidate the one-sided mass viewpoint and the viewpoint of bestowing favors and relief, as well as the idea of simply requesting loans from higher levels without knowing how to organize and use the original funds. In the future collection of loans, we must learn from past lessons and pay close attention to: (1) According to the season and the production habits of the masses, regional conditions, adopt different methods for different situations, such as cotton-producing areas have not yet seen a harvest, it is necessary to wait. The key collection proposed by Feixiang is worth learning. (2) The regulations on the price of in-kind repayment should reward early repayment and restrict deliberate delays. In-kind repayment can be collected at a high price, but it should not exceed 10% of the market price. At the same time, the types of in-kind repayment should not be too many, and the quality should be guaranteed so that it is easy to sell and easy to store. (3) Oppose the single-handed style of work, and combine the collection of loans to understand the local autumn and winter production difficulties, and determine further plans to organize and assist mass production, especially in disaster areas and cities, and should pay more attention to lending as you collect. In the past, some counties stored in-kind items in order to preserve capital, and it was wrong not to adopt the method of investing in production for mobile turnover to achieve capital preservation. (4) Strengthen the leadership of loan collection. In the case of a lack of bank cadres, it is advocated that party and government cadres jointly take responsibility, and that strong cadres be assigned to work in the bank. In individual areas, if someone really cannot repay the loan temporarily, strict procedures and systems must be stipulated for rescheduling or in-kind repayment.

### 冀南三专署　检查催收旧贷工作

　　冀南三专署
  　检查催收旧贷工作
    【冀南电】为了使贷款有借有还，确实起到组织群众生产的作用，冀南三专署顷发出催收旧贷通报，内称：自麦收后布置了催收旧贷工作以来，除成磁、企之工作较有成绩外，其他县作的均不够好，甚至有的县根本未作。检查原因：（一）主要是各级领导干部存在着片面的贫雇观点与恩赐观点，视贷款为救济，因此在收款之初，某些县份尾随于少数群众，要求领导上“宽恩不收”或“缓收”，还有少数干部认为收贷工作是得罪人的事，不肯大力去作，采取消极拖延态度，有的甚至站在银行与群众之间来调和说情，把收贷看成是银行的事。另外部分干部，对收贷是为了进一步扶植生产认识不明确，因此执行中不坚决。成磁有的区以“现在正进行生产，收贷会影响群众情绪”为借口，拒绝不作。大名、魏县有些区本来水灾很轻，但也借口停收。据永年西善寨调查，全村只三户一时实在没法归还，百分之九十以上的户还款并没多大问题。成磁三区由于领导态度明确，动员深入，五天即全部收回，证明只要领导上善于启发解释，使群众了解收贷是为了更好的扶植生产，群众是愿意而且完全能够归还旧贷的。因此，领导干部思想未搞通，是收贷工作失败的最重要原因。（二）收贷中部分地区领导上没有根据实际情况分别对待。如老弱孤寡生活困难，一时确实还不起者，就必须缓期或分期归还。对吃喝浪费不事生产者，如不坚决设法收回欠款，老实农民亦不同情，同时失掉贷款扶植生产的意义。（三）布置不及时，收贷错过农业季节。据各县调查，群众敢贷款，就是指望麦后还。而有些县份拖延到秋前才布置收贷，群众的麦子用完了，秋粮也还没下来，收贷不得不落空。另外，有的地区没按时收贷清帐，有的户连贷四、五次，累到十几万元，以致一时难以还清。（四）无组织无准备。县仓库设备不健全，收实中的成色好坏无人鉴别，运送，保管及各种手续又无专人管理。过去贷款给村并未经一定组织，今日收贷发生困难，形成收贷工作从上而下的无组织无领导状态。其次，收贷前不及早声明，群众没准备。收贷一开始，干部就立逼交款，群众瞒怨我们在青黄不接时候逼帐。除成磁、永年外，其他县至九月底仍未通知群众，致使一些能够收回的款未能收回。根据以上情况，三专署指示所属，今后要结合土改整党工作，重新布置收贷，坚决贯彻非灾区全部收回、轻灾区收回大部、灾区收回一部的方针。首先要彻底清算片面的群众观点与恩赐救济观点，以及单纯向上级要求贷款，而不会组织使用原有资金的思想。在今后收贷中要接受以往教训，切实注意：（一）根据季节及群众生产习惯、地区条件，采取不同情况不同对待的方法，如产棉区现在尚未见收成，就需等待。肥乡提出的重点催收是应该学习的。（二）折实价格的规定，应奖励早还，限制故意拖延，可以高价收实，但以不超过市价百分之十为准。同时，收实种类不应过多，并保证成色好，以便容易出售，兼易保存。（三）反对单打一作风，应结合收贷了解当地秋冬生产困难，确定组织与扶助群众生产的进一步计划，特别在灾区与城市，更应注意随收随贷。过去有的县为了保本而收存实物，没有从投入生产机动周转来达到保本的做法是不对的。（四）加强收贷领导，在银行干部缺乏的情况下，提倡党政干部共同负责，并配备强有力干部到银行工作。个别地区如有人确实一时不能交回贷款，转期或折实都必须规定严格手续与制度。
