    “Advance on Taiyuan, capture Yan Xishan alive!”
    Laborers from Various Counties in Jinzhong Rush to the Front Lines Overnight
    [Jinzhong Electric Dispatch] “Advance on Taiyuan, capture Yan Xishan alive!” Over ten thousand enthusiastic laborers from various liberated counties in the Jinzhong region are rushing to the Taiyuan front lines overnight to participate in the war. During mobilization, the masses in the newly liberated counties launched movements to pour out grievances and seek revenge, stirring up hatred towards the bandit Yan, and enthusiastically volunteering to join the war. Liu Hongde from the Fourth District of Taigu tearfully recounted how Yan's bandits forced him to sell his tofu grinder, his livelihood for over a decade, to provide grain; he was then conscripted into the regular army, and upon his return, he spent his days building fortifications. He said, "Eliminating Yan Xishan is crucial to preventing a major disaster. I'll gladly participate in the war for the rest of my life. If I don't go to the front lines, I'm not worthy of my parents." An old man from Beishahe made two mistakes while writing his confession during Yan's bandits’ “self-confession and rebirth” campaign and was falsely accused of "pretending" and beaten half to death. He declared, "If we don't eliminate Yan Xishan, that dog, the next time (referring to Yan's bandits), he will still treat us as 'pretenders' and beat us to death." Women also actively encouraged their husbands and sons to join the war and offered to help the laborers with production. Many village chiefs and self-defense force members who had been forced to work for Yan's bandits also expressed their grievances, requesting to participate in the war and earn merit to atone for their sins and "capture old Yan alive to avenge our great hatred." Most of the laborers from Shouyang were refugees who had fled to the Meng County area when Yan's bandits created a no-man's land. After recounting how they were killed and robbed by Yan's bandits and left homeless, they proposed: "Remember this blood feud and make Yan's bandits repay their blood debt." At the mobilization rally in the Sixth District of the county to see off the laborers, Zheng Damao said, "We've been waiting anxiously for the chance to fight Taiyuan. I've become the leader of the stretcher-bearer team. I guarantee I won't violate discipline and will rescue the wounded on the front lines." The transport platoon leader said, "Yan Xishan has pushed us to the brink of starvation. The People's Liberation Army liberated Shouyang and then provided loans for grain and seedlings. What are we waiting for if we don't contribute?" Women recounted their past experiences as refugees and volunteered to form production guarantee groups to help the laborers harvest the autumn crops first. The masses in Hedong Village, Fourth District of Jiexiu, had eleven people killed and more than thirty houses destroyed by Yan's bandits, and the masses were forced to flee; out of thirteen hectares of land in the entire village, eight hectares were left uncultivated; when discussing the task of supporting the front, everyone said, "Fighting Taiyuan is our own business. We've been waiting anxiously for this moment. We'll contribute whatever we have!" Women in Dong Village, Second District of Xiaoyi, helped the laborers who were participating in the war harvest the autumn crops because their men were delivering equipment, and they worked through the night to make cotton clothes for the laborers. Various counties held grand rallies to see off the laborers, and made mutual guarantees: those going to the front would not return home until Taiyuan was taken, while those in the rear would guarantee the laborers’ autumn harvest. At the rally to see off the laborers in Xiaoyi, attended by over a thousand people, thousands of laborers and students held high portraits of Chairman Mao and shouted, "We won't go home until we smash the salt jar (referring to Yan's bandits)." The laborers marched with great enthusiasm. The laborers from Jiexiu traveled for five days and five nights without sleep to reach the front lines, without complaining about the rain along the way. Seven who had fallen behind found their way to the front three days later. The laborers from Xin County, after receiving orders, traveled to the front lines without eating for a whole day and night. They said, "If we don't take Taiyuan, that dog Yan Xishan will come again and demand three stones, five dou and two (referring to a portion of grain levied), and we'll starve to death again." Li Fangcheng, the vice squad leader of the laborers from Meng County in the old liberated area, said to everyone when they were tired, "We've finally made it to today to fight Taiyuan, let's hurry!" During the march, the laborers from Wutai took advantage of rest periods to help the masses along the way harvest the autumn crops, and the masses gave them dates as dry rations. The laborers from various units, upon arriving at the front lines, immediately threw themselves into intense work. The militia company from Xiaoyi and the laborers from Jiexiu, who had not yet been assigned tasks and were temporarily resting, wrote letters requesting assignments and demanding to participate in the war immediately.
