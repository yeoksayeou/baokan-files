Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Chiang Kai-shek's loyal lackey, Chen Bulei, committed suicide by taking sleeping pills in Nanjing on the 13th of this month. This is another symbol of the complete despair and impending demise of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Chen Bulei was a member of the Kuomintang Central Committee and the secretary-general of the Central Political Committee, the highest decision-making body of the Kuomintang. He was one of Chiang Kai-shek's most trusted lackeys and accomplices. However, Chiang Kai-shek today cannot even unite such lackeys, nor can he give them any confidence in the future. It is reported that Chen Bulei, who was extremely pessimistic about the Kuomintang's future, committed suicide after being severely scolded by Chiang Kai-shek. This is a typical picture of the end of all reactionaries. Chen's self-description in his suicide note as "running on empty" is a true reflection of the entire Kuomintang reactionary rule today.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Publications in the Kuomintang-controlled areas report on the pathetic state of Bai Chongxi and Fu Zuoyi before the victory of the People's Liberation Army. The "China News" magazine in Nanjing on October 16 stated: Bai Chongxi held a press conference in Hankou on September 17, "admitting the failure of the Kuomintang and the success of the Communist Party." He said: "The Communist Party is a political party with theory and organization, and it is united with the people." The Kuomintang "is no match for them in organization, nor is it a match for them in theory. To fight like this is simply digging our own graves!" The "News World" magazine published in Shanghai on September 1st revealed: Due to the deterioration of the military situation, Fu Zuoyi often "asked visitors, 'What should we do?' This sudden question baffled the visitors and they were unable to answer. He suddenly stood up from the sofa, walked back and forth with his head down and hands behind his back as if deep in thought, then suddenly sat down again and continued to say, 'What should we do? … What should we do? …', startling the visitors into quietly leaving."

　　国民党“油尽灯枯”
    蒋介石忠实走狗陈布雷自杀
  　白崇禧傅作义亦皆悲观绝望
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】蒋介石的忠实走狗陈布雷本月十三日在南京服安眠药自杀，这是国民党反动派完全绝望和即将灭亡的又一个象征。陈布雷是国民党中央委员和国民党最高决策机关中央政治委员会的秘书长，是蒋贼介石最亲信的奴才和帮凶之一。但是蒋贼在今天就是对于这样的奴才，也已经不能够团结，也已经不能够使其对前途有一点信心。据悉对国民党前途极端悲观的陈布雷，因被蒋介石大骂而自杀。这是一切反动派末日的典型景象。陈在遗书中自称“油尽灯枯”正是今天整个国民党反动统治的写照。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】国民党区的刊物报导着白崇禧与傅作义在解放军胜利前的狼狈相。十月十六日南京“中国新闻”杂志称：九月十七日白匪崇禧在汉口举行记者招待会，“承认国民党的失败，共产党的成功。”他说：“共产党是一个有理论有组织的政党，和人民结合在一起。”国民党“组织不敌于人，理论也不敌于人，如此作战，当然是自掘坟墓！”九月一日上海出版的“新闻天地”杂志披露：由于军事形势的恶化，傅匪即“常面向来宾问‘怎么办？’这句突如其来的话，使来宾摸不着头脑而无法回答。他忽的由沙发上站起，低额背手走来走去若有深思，忽的又坐下，又续说出几句‘怎么办？………怎么办？………’，使来宾惊诧得悄悄，退出。”
