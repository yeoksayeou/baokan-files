Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 4th: The Harbin Department Store has made significant contributions in the first half of this year to supporting industrial production, circulating goods, supplying civilian needs, and adjusting financial prices. Based on the principle that "all rear work must serve the interests of developing production," the company is now planning to expand the supply of raw materials needed by key factories and directly allocate a portion of cloth to public employees and the people, so that they can obtain more affordable necessities.

After the Harbin Department Store was formed in August of last year by the merger of the Second and Third Business Departments of the Northeast Trade Bureau and the Dongxing Department Store, its business has expanded daily. The average monthly sales amount this year is already ten times that of last year, equivalent to the value of more than three million catties of cotton yarn. Among these sales, 32% are sold to direct consumers in government agencies, troops, organizations, and the general public; 50% are sold to private industrial and commercial enterprises; 15% are sold to public enterprises; and 3% are sold to cooperatives. The company's turnover accounts for about one-third of the total company transactions in the city. Among the various daily necessities and light industrial factories in Harbin, 40% regularly engage in business dealings with the company, such as ordering, consignment sales, and processing. Of the cotton yarn raw materials sold by the company in the first half of the year, approximately 40% were directly purchased by various factories in Harbin. In addition, the company entrusted local factories with cotton yarn raw materials worth 14 million yuan to process into finished products, which played a significant role in supporting the development of various light industries in Harbin. Factories that have business dealings with the company have increased their production by more than one time, some by eight times, and some even by twenty times. Last year, the total cloth production of Harbin factories was only 80,000 bolts, while the company entrusted factories to process 63,500 bolts in the first half of this year alone. Last year, the factories' match production was 5,000 boxes, while the number ordered and already produced in the first half of this year reached more than 6,400 boxes. There are a total of 50,000 workers in Harbin who rely on the company's processing and orders to engage in production to maintain their livelihoods or supplement a large portion of their income. The total value of raw materials sold by the company to various factories, the goods ordered from various factories, and the processing fees paid to various factories accounts for one-third of the company's current cash business.

The company's operations still have many shortcomings. For example, because cooperative enterprises have not been widely developed, the company still cannot directly sell 40% of its goods to consumers, resulting in increased burdens on consumers due to repeated transfers. Furthermore, when implementing the principle of "everything serving the interests of developing production," the thinking is not clear enough, and not enough ways have been considered to realize this principle. In addition, the company's goods are too simple and the styles are not diverse enough, which cannot meet the needs of the people. In the future, in addition to continuing to supply factories with raw materials and strengthening consumer business, the company's business policy will also include taking over the Harbin Industrial Exhibition, expanding the scope of business, and handling the following three types of business: (1) displaying local industrial products; (2) selling products from local factories on consignment; and (3) acting as an agent for industrial loans.

  　扶助工业流通物资供应民需调剂物价
    【新华社哈尔滨四日电】哈尔滨百货公司本年上半年度在扶助工业生产、流通物资、供应民需、调剂金融物价上贡献巨大。根据“一切后方工作都必须服从于发展生产的利益”的方针，该公司现正拟扩大供应各重要工厂所需原料，并以一部分布匹直接配售给公教人员与人民，使他们得到更低廉的生活必需品。
    百货公司于去年八月由东北贸易总局第二、第三营业部与东兴百货公司合组而成后，营业逐日扩大，今年每月的平均售货金额，已十倍于去年，合三百万斤以上的棉纱的价值。其中百分之三十二售给机关、部队、团体及人民中的直接消费者，百分之五十售给私营工商业，百分之十五售给公营企业，百分之三售给合作社。该公司营业额约占全市公司交易总额的三分之一。哈尔滨市各种日用品轻工业工厂中，有百分之四十与该公司经常发生订购、代销、加工等业务往来。该公司上半年中出售之花纱原料，约有百分之四十直接由哈市各工厂买去；此外，该公司以价值一千四百万万元之棉纱原料，委托市内各厂加工制造成品，对哈市各种轻工业的发展，起了极大的扶助作用。与该公司有往来的工厂，生产都增加了一倍以上，有的增加八倍，有的甚至达二十倍。去年全年哈市各工厂产布仅八万匹，今年上半年该公司委托各厂的加工布匹即有六万三千五百匹；去年各厂火柴产量为五千箱，今年上半年定购并已出产的即达六千四百余箱。哈市职工中依靠该公司加工、定货从事生产以维持生活或补助大部生活者，共有五万人。该公司售给各工厂之原料，向各工厂订购之货物以及付给各工厂之加工费等总值，共合该公司现款营业的三分之一。
    该公司业务中尚有不少缺点，如由于合作事业未普遍开展，迄今该公司仍有百分之四十的物品不能直接售给消费者，而经过一再转手，增加消费者的负担。又如执行一切服从发展生产的利益这一方针时，思想上还不够明确，未多想办法实现这一方针。又加该公司货物种类过于简单，式样不多，还不能满足人民需求。今后该公司业务方针，除继续供应各厂生产原料及加强消费业务外，并决定接办哈尔滨工业展览会，扩大业务范围，办理下列三项业务：（一）陈列本市工业品；（二）代销本市工厂出品；（三）代理工业贷款。
