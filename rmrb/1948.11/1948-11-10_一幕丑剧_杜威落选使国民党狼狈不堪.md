　　An Ugly Farce
  　Dewey's Defeat Leaves the Kuomintang in a Terrible Plight
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. The failure of Dewey in the American election has left the Kuomintang bandit gang and its propaganda organ, the Central News Agency, in a terrible plight, as they had hoped for Dewey's election. According to a United Press report, Kuomintang figures "openly expressed alarm at Dewey's overthrow," and Kuomintang newspapers "reflected a general displeasure at Dewey's failure." Chiang Kai-shek himself made an utter fool of himself, having "designated his private secretary to pay attention to the radio news of the election all night," and Dewey's defeat "gave him a completely unexpected shock." Although the Truman government has already provided the Kuomintang with nearly $5 billion in aid since the war, and continues to implement a completely reactionary policy of aiding the Kuomintang reactionaries, due to the corruption, incompetence, and insatiable greed of the Chiang Kai-shek group, disputes are bound to arise between the Truman government and the Chiang Kai-shek group, like those between a father who controls the purse strings and his prodigal son. The gambler Chiang Kai-shek bet on the replacement of his old father, ingratiating himself with his anticipated new father, hoping that Dewey would be more generous with him. As early as June, Chiang Kai-shek sent Chen Lifu to the United States to pay homage to Dewey and conduct activities. Chen personally attended the Republican Party convention, saying he was "learning American democracy." According to a United Press report from Shanghai on October 25th, on the eve of the American election, when Chiang Kai-shek was staying in Beiping, hundreds of Kuomintang followers in Beiping held a "parade to strive for Dewey's election as president" on the 24th, behind a huge photo of Dewey and ten musicians dressed in Qing Dynasty princely robes. On the day of the American election (the 2nd), the Central News Agency's special dispatch from New York gave a detailed account of the Republican Party's cries for aid to Chiang from John Hay's Open Door Policy in China to Dewey's successive calls, falsely claiming that Dewey's coming to power would "indicate that the United States will restore its traditional (?) policy towards China," that this year's American aid bill to Chiang was due to Dewey's role, and that Marshall had "reluctantly agreed," and so on. The Central News Agency's hope for Dewey's coming to power was so urgent that it had pre-written two articles, "Dewey - The Master of the White House for the Next Four Years" and "Dewey's Foreign Policy," and distributed them to Kuomintang newspapers across the country in preparation for publication. When it saw that the situation was not right on the evening of the 3rd, it hurriedly notified them to withdraw the articles. For the Chinese people, Truman and Dewey are no different; they are equally reactionary and equally unable to prevent the victory of the Chinese people. But for the Kuomintang reactionaries, it is a different matter. The disillusionment of the Kuomintang's dreams of Dewey is occurring at a time when the Kuomintang has been completely annihilated in the Northeast, the gold yuan and price controls have collapsed, the Nanjing "cabinet" has resigned, and the various reactionary factions within the Kuomintang are in intense conflict with each other. Therefore, even a small matter like Dewey's defeat has become like the end of the world for them. The Kuomintang reactionaries are now still facing their old father, Truman. They hate each other, distrust each other, and know that no one can save anyone, but they still have to rely on each other until the victory of the Chinese people throughout the country ends this ugly farce.

### 一幕丑剧　杜威落选使国民党狼狈不堪

　　一幕丑剧
  　杜威落选使国民党狼狈不堪
    【新华社陕北七日电】美国大选中杜威之失败，使希望杜威当选的国民党匪帮及其宣传机关中央社狼狈不堪。合众社消息称：国民党方面人士“对杜威被颠覆公开地表示惊心”，国民党报纸“反映着一般对杜威失败的不悦”。而蒋贼本人，更是丑态百出，曾“指定其私人秘书彻夜注意竞选的无线电消息”，而杜威的挫败使之“顿受完全出乎意料的一惊”。虽然杜鲁门政府战后已援助国民党近五十亿美元的巨款，现在也继续执行着援助国民党反动派的完全反动的政策，但是由于蒋介石集团的腐败无能和贪得无厌，在杜鲁门政府与蒋介石集团之间，不能不发生管钱袋的爸爸和他的浪子之间的那种争吵。赌徒蒋介石把赌注押在他的老爸爸将要更换这几点上，对他所预期的新爸爸大献殷勤，指望杜威对他的手面可以更宽些。远在六月，蒋介石即派陈立夫赴美朝觐杜威，进行活动，陈匪亲自出席共和党大会，说是“学习美国民主”。据合众社上海十月二十五日电，在美国大选的前夕，当蒋介石滞留北平时，北平国民党徒数百名曾于二十四日在巨幅杜威像片和十个身穿满清王公礼服的乐师后面，举行了“争取杜威当选总统的游行”。在美国大选之日（二日），中央社纽约专电中把共和党从海约翰的中国门户开放宣言到杜威的历次援蒋叫嚣，详尽地介绍了一番，胡说什么杜威上台是“表示美国将恢复（？）传统（？）对华政策”，美国今年的援蒋法案是由于杜威的作用，而马歇尔则系“勉强同意”等等。中央社希望杜威上台如此急切，以致预先写好了“杜威——今后四年白宫的主人”及“杜威的外交政策”两文，分发各地国民党报纸，准备发表。到了三日晚上见势头不对，又慌忙通报撤销。对于中国人民来说，杜鲁门和杜威并无任何不同，他们是同样反动，并且同样不能阻止中国人民的胜利。但是对于国民党反动派却是另一种情形。国民党对杜威梦想的幻灭，正发生于国民党在东北全军覆没、金圆券和限价办法崩溃、南京的“内阁”辞职、国民党内各个反动派别互相激烈冲突的时候，因此象杜威落选的这样一件小事对于他们也成了世界末日似的打击。国民党反动派现在仍然是面对着老爸爸杜鲁门，他们互相讨厌，互相不信任，互相懂得谁也救不了谁，但是又仍旧不能不互相依靠，直到中国人民在全国胜利时来结束这幕丑剧为止。
