Reasons for An Guo's Laborers' Success:

An Guo County's laborers achieved such success due to the following key experiences: (1) Following the support provided to the Baoding-North battles last year, the County Party Committee convened a grand celebration rally. At the rally, it was solemnly stated that laborers who had contributed were infinitely honored, had made contributions to the people and the revolution, and were commended. A call was made for all laborers in the county to learn from the meritorious individuals and strive to contribute. It was also pointed out that laborers were the most important part of supporting the war, and everyone should value the task of laborers. This raised the people's political awareness, enlightened the political consciousness of the masses, and aroused enthusiastic support for the front lines. Therefore, during this year's first lunar month expedition, the vast majority of laborers volunteered and were in high spirits. Before departure, the county-level leaders personally gave earnest instructions, further strengthening the laborers' fighting spirit. (2) The production problems of laborers' families were appropriately resolved. Before the expedition, the New Farmers' Associations in each village specifically assigned responsibilities for plowing and managing households on behalf of the poor laborers' families. For laborers' families with manpower and livestock, some organized mutual assistance; many village New Farmers' Associations signed agreements for代耕 with laborers' families. After the laborers left, their families were ensured timely cultivation without耽误农时, which the laborers' families welcomed and appreciated. At the same time, the laborers' families frequently sent letters to the front lines, reporting on the pleasant production situation at home. Therefore, the laborers' concerns about their families were greatly stabilized and relieved. Li Jilin, a meritorious laborer who was too old to go to the front this time, continuously supervised and inspected the production situation of laborers' families in various villages, which also played a significant role. The main reason why no laborers in the county deserted this time was precisely this. (3) The high quality of the laborers and the exemplary leadership of Party members and meritorious individuals played a significant role. Half of the laborers in this expedition were Party members and backbone elements who had turned over to become masters of their fate, so they completed the tasks through their leadership and that of the meritorious individuals. For example, in the battle to support Huai'an in Chahar South, it was necessary to cross the Sanggan River that night. The river had just thawed, and ice floes were running and hitting each other. The ice was bitterly cold, and no one dared to cross. Party members Wang Wenhan, Cui Qingshan, and others were the first to cross the river, setting an example. Therefore, any difficulties encountered in performing tasks could be easily solved. (4) Timely ideological education was conducted. Whenever ideological problems were discovered, they were immediately resolved without delay. When living in Jiang's "no-man's land" in Rehe, because life was relatively difficult, individual laborers showed that they could not bear the hardship. After the leadership discovered this situation, they immediately conducted a review of the struggle against famine in the entire regiment and organized visits to poor households to hear their sufferings, transforming the idea of not being able to endure hardship. During the rest period in Chahar South, the ranks were reorganized, and a查思想 campaign was launched to eliminate the thought of deserting among individual laborers.

### 获得成绩的原因：  领导上注意提高群众政治觉悟适当解决了民工家中生产问题党员、功臣带头与困难作斗争

    获得成绩的原因：
    领导上注意提高群众政治觉悟适当解决了民工家中生产问题党员、功臣带头与困难作斗争
    安国民工所以获得这样成绩，有以下几点经验：（一）该县在去年支援保北战役之后，县委即召开了隆重盛大的庆功大会，会上郑重提出了立了功的民工是无上光荣，是对人民、对革命有供献，作了表扬。并号召全县民工要向功臣学习，争立功劳。又指明民工是支援战争中最主要的部分，人人要重视民工的任务。如此提高了人民的政治认识，启发了群众政治觉悟，激起了积极支前的情绪。所以在这次正月远征时，绝大多数民工是自动报名，情绪很高。临出发前，县级首长亲自谆谆嘱咐，进一步坚定了民工的斗志。（二）适当的解决了民工家中的生产问题。出征前，各村新农会对贫苦的民工家属，都具体分工负起了代耕管家的责任。对有人、畜力的民工家属，有的组织了互助；不少的村里新农会与民工家属立了代耕的字据。民工走后，对他们的家属作到了按时耕作不误农时，民工家属欢迎满意。同时民工家属时常给前方去信，报告家中生产愉快的情况。因此，大大安定与解除了民工顾家的思想。支前功臣李吉林因年岁太大，这次没到前方，但他不断到各村督促检查对民工家属的生产情况，亦起了很大作用。这次该县民工无一逃亡，其主要原因即在于此。（三）民工质量高，与党员功臣的模范带头起了很大作用。这次远征民工，半数是党员与翻身骨干，所以在执行任务中，就是通过他们与功臣的带头，完成了任务。如在察南支援怀安之役，当夜须过到桑乾河那边去，河冻刚解，冰块挤的“吃吃”的跑，寒冰刺骨，无人敢渡；党员王文汉、崔青山等即首先渡河，起了带头作用。因此，在执行任务中，有何困难均能迎刃而解。（四）及时进行思想教育。何时发现了思想情况，即马上解决，不拖延。在热河蒋造“无人区”住时，因生活较艰苦，个别民工表现着受不了苦，领导上发现此情况后，马上在全团进行了与灾荒斗争的回忆，并组织了访苦组，下户访苦，转变了不能吃苦的思想。在察南休整时，并进行整顿队伍，开展了查思想，肃清了个别民工企图开小差的思想。
