Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 10th: Our army continues to achieve victory on the western front of Xuzhou. On the 9th, at Lizhuang Station, east of Yangshan, we routed the enemy Fifth Army, which was fleeing east from Dangshan, killing and wounding many, and capturing over 1,200 alive. The transport battalion of the 45th Division of that army surrendered to us in its entirety. The 45th Division had already suffered hundreds of casualties and captures at the hands of our forces southeast of Dangshan on the 8th. The Fifth Army belongs to Qiu Qingquan's Second Army Group and is known as one of the "Five Main Forces" of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. It is the backbone of the four army groups of the Kuomintang army in Xuzhou. In this operation, the enemy only sought to escape, and its morale was extremely low.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 10th: The more than 1,100 members of the Kuomintang Security Police Force and Regular Force who revolted in Chaoyi on October 6th have now been reorganized into the Chaoyi Detachment of the Northwest Liberation Army. Yang Haichao and Wang Yanting, who led the uprising, continue to serve as commanders of the detachment. Since the uprising, the team has been warmly welcomed by the military and civilians of the Northwest. Deputy Commander Peng recently sent a telegram of congratulations and the Party, government, military, and civilians of the Huanglong Sub-district all visited to express their support, and over a hundred farmers voluntarily joined the team. The detachment has now moved to a certain location for reorganization and is undergoing policy and discipline education. The detachment has established a revolutionary soldiers' committee and launched a democratic grievance campaign to raise awareness. Prior to the uprising, the team had been discriminated against by the Hu Zongnan bandit gang. At the end of September, the bandit authorities transferred the team back from the border of Han and Zheng, plotting to eliminate it. As a result, the team took advantage of the opportunity when our Northwest Field Army annihilated the majority of the enemy's 17th and 28th Divisions and resolutely launched an uprising on the morning of October 6th to seek their own liberation. During the uprising, order in Chaoyi City was good, shops remained open as usual, and Chaoyi Middle School continued to hold classes as normal. At noon that day, when a deputy regimental commander of the enemy's 17th Division led three companies fleeing into the city, they were immediately disarmed and captured by the team.

　　徐州西线我军续获胜利
    俘匪第五军千余人
  　一个输送营全部向我投诚
    【新华社淮海前线十日电】徐州西线我军续获胜利。九日在杨山以东的李庄车站击溃由砀山东逃之敌第五军，除毙伤外，生俘其一千二百余名。该军四十五师之输送营全部向我投诚。该师八日在砀山东南曾被我毙伤俘数百人。第五军隶属邱匪清泉的第二兵团，号称蒋匪的“五大主力”之一，是徐州国民党军四个兵团中的骨干，在此次作战中，该敌只求逃脱，士气极度低落。
    【新华社西北十日电】前于十月六日在朝邑起义的国民党保警队、常备队一千一百余人，现已改编为西北解放军朝邑支队，领导起义之杨海朝、王彦亭仍任该支队首长。该队起义以来受到西北军民的热烈欢迎，彭副总司令日前曾去电慰勉，黄龙分区党政军民均往慰问，并有农民百余自动参加该队。现该队已移驻某地整训，进行政策纪律教育。该队已建立革命军人委员会，展开民主诉苦运动，提高觉悟。按该队起义前向受胡宗南匪帮歧视。九月底匪方将该队自韩、郑边境调回，阴谋解决。至此，该队即乘我西北野战军歼敌整十七师及整二十八师大部之际，于十月六日晨毅然举义，自求解放。起义时朝邑城内秩序良好，商店照旧开门营业，朝邑中学仍照常上课。是日午，敌整十七师一个副团长率三个连溃入该城时，立被该队缴械俘获。
