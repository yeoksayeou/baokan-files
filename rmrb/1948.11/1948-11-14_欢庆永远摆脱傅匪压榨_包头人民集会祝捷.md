Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 12th. The democratic social order in Baotou City has been completely established. By the 30th of last month, all schools in the city had resumed classes, factories had resumed work, and shops had opened for business. The Baotou Military Control Commission announced its dissolution on the 1st of this month, and all staff members of the Baotou Municipal Government have taken office and are performing their duties. On the afternoon of October 30th, the military and civilians of Baotou held an unprecedentedly grand victory celebration in the city. More than 20,000 men and women citizens attended the meeting excitedly, carrying lanterns and flags. The joyful citizens wrote on the lanterns and flags: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Celebrate the great victory of the People's Liberation Army!" The citizens of Baotou, who had long suffered under the Jiang-Fu bandit gang, saw Chairman Mao's portrait for the first time. They closely followed the propaganda vehicles, shouting "Support Chairman Mao!" with great enthusiasm. At the beginning of the victory celebration, Li Zhimin, director of the Baotou Military Control Commission, spoke amidst prolonged applause. He said that the Suiyuan People's Liberation Army is fully capable of liberating the entire Suiyuan, and the fate of Fu Zuoyi's bandit army, trapped in the isolated city of Gui Sui, will not last long. Erdeni, the representative of the Mongol banner, pointed out in his speech that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Mongolian people will surely gain freedom and liberation. When the merchant representative spoke, he deeply rejoiced that he would be forever free from the Fu bandit's extortionate taxes and levies. That night, illuminating fireballs were launched into the sky above Baotou, and the whole city was brightly lit, as bright as day. The jubilant citizens held a city-wide parade.
