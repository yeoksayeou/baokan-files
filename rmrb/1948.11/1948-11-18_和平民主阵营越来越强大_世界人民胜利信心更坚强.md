　　The Peace and Democracy Camp Grows Stronger
  　The World's People Have Greater Confidence in Victory
    As the world's people warmly celebrate the 31st anniversary of the Great October Revolution in the Soviet Union, they are filled with strong confidence in winning democratic peace.

    On November 7th, celebrations with lanterns, decorations, rallies and parades were held everywhere in the Soviet Union. Moscow held a grand military parade, demonstrating "the unwavering power of the Soviet armed forces to ensure the peaceful labor of the people and guard the interests of the country" (TASS). Countless motorized troops, invincible infantry, cavalry, and artillery rolled across Red Square, and formations of various aircraft swept through the sky; the sounds of artillery salutes, motors, and cheers merged into an iron torrent. At the Moscow celebration meeting on the 6th, Molotov delivered an extremely important lengthy speech, pointing out the increasing strength of the Soviet Union and the anti-imperialist camp, and the inevitable failure of the aggressive policies of the Anglo-American ruling clique. Molotov indicated that the Soviet Union "is in a new stage of rising," with industry exceeding pre-war levels, "this year proceeding at a level 17 percent higher than the pre-war year of 1940." Grain harvest has reached pre-war levels, the people's lives are continuously improving, and broad new achievements have also been obtained on the cultural and scientific fronts. Molotov pointed out that the various "alliances" and "groups" recently established by the Anglo-American ruling clique in Western countries "are aimed at preparing new aggression and promoting new wars." He affirmed: "The anti-Soviet conspiracies currently being carried out by various agents of the new war instigators are under the vigilant surveillance of the Soviet Union and the democratic forces of the world." "The era when the people were the blind tools of this or that ruling clique is over," "The international camp of supporters of peace and democracy is becoming increasingly strong, is becoming a huge and invincible force, and the Soviet Union is standing at the forefront of this camp."

    In Milan, Italy's largest industrial center, a massive demonstration of 500,000 people was held on the 7th under the slogan of "struggling for peace, socialism, and friendship between the Italian and Soviet peoples" to commemorate this festival. Democratic parties and groups in Germany, democratic groups in the capitals of Sweden and Belgium, as well as progressive groups and democrats in the United States, have all held meetings or sent telegrams to the Soviet Union, expressing their longing, love, and congratulations to the Soviet Union. American writer Howard Fast wrote in a telegram: "The flame of socialism burns ever brighter, it is the hope of all mankind, and the day will come when millions of Americans recognize this."

    Amidst the amazing victories of the People's Liberation Army's autumn offensive, the Chinese people commemorate this year's October Revolution Day with particularly joyful and encouraging feelings.

    Other relatively important international events in China during the past week are as follows:

    (1) Eight million workers in the U.S.-British joint occupation zone of West Germany held a one-day general strike on the 12th to protest the high cost of living. The chairman of the Joint Occupation Zone Trade Union Committee announced that if the German authorities in the Joint Occupation Zone do not meet the workers' demands, the trade union will take new actions.

    (2) The French Senate election has ended. As a result of the reactionaries' tampering with the election law, the number of seats obtained in the Senate by reactionary parties such as De Gaulle's Rally of the French People is disproportionate to their actual strength. The French Communist Party issued a statement, pointing out that the new Senate does not represent the will of the French people. (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th)

　　和平民主阵营越来越强大
  　世界人民胜利信心更坚强
    世界人民在热烈庆祝苏联伟大十月革命三十一周年纪念的时候，充满了赢得民主和平的坚强信心。
    十一月七月，全苏各地张灯结彩，集会游行，狂欢庆祝。莫斯科举行了盛大的阅兵典礼，表现了“保障人民和平劳动和警卫国家利益的苏维埃武装部队坚强不拔的威力”（塔斯社）。数不清的摩托部队、无敌的步、骑、炮兵，滚滚穿过红场，一队队的各式机群掠空而过；礼炮声、马达声和欢呼声汇成一支铁流。在六日莫斯科庆祝大会上，莫洛托夫发表了极其重要的长篇演说，指出苏联与反帝国主义阵营力量的更趋强大与美英统治集团侵略政策的必归失败。莫洛托夫指明：苏联“正处在一个新的上升阶段”，工业已超过战前水平，“今年正以高于战前一九四○年百分之十七的水平进行着”。谷物收获量已达到战前水平，人民生活不断提高，文化科学战线上亦获得了广阔的新成就。莫洛托夫指出：美英统治集团最近建立的西方各国的各种“联盟”与“集团”，“是以准备新的侵略与促成新的战争为目的”。他肯定地指出：“新战争鼓动者的各种代理人现正进行的反苏阴谋，已在苏联与全世界民主力量警觉的监视之下”。“人民是这个或那个统治集团的盲目的工具的时代已经过去了”，“和平与民主的支持者的国际阵营，正在愈来愈强大，正在变成一支巨大而不可战胜的力量，而苏联正站在这个阵营的前列。”
    在意大利最大的工业中心米兰市，在“为和平、社会主义及意苏两国人民之友谊而斗争”的口号下，在七日举行了五十万人的大示威游行，以纪念这一节日。德国各民主政党团体、瑞典与比利时首都的民主团体，以及美国的进步团体及民主人士，均纷纷集会或致电苏联，表示对苏联的憧憬、热爱和祝贺。美国名作家法斯特在电文中写道：“社会主义的火焰，燃烧得更加明亮了，它是全人类的希望，千百万美国人民认识这一点的日子将要来临了。”
    在人民解放军秋季攻势惊人胜利声中，中国人民则怀着特别欢欣鼓舞的心情，来纪念今年的十月革命节。
    过去一周中国际上其他较重要的事件如下：
    （一）西德美英联合占领区八百万工人，于十二日举行总罢工一日，以抗议生活费用的高涨。联占区职工会委员会主席宣布，如联占区德国当局不满足工人们的要求，则职工会将采取新行动。
    （二）法国参院选举已经结束。由于反动派窜改选举法的结果，戴高乐人民联盟等反动党派在参院所得的席位和它们的实际力量不相称。法共发表声明，指出新的参院并不代表法国人民的意志。（新华社陕北十六日电）
