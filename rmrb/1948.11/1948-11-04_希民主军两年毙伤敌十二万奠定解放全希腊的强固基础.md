In the nine months of this year, the number of killed or wounded in all Greek territories reached more than 75,000.

    【新华社陕北二日电】自由希腊电台在十月二十八日的广播中，庆祝马科斯将军率领的希腊民主军成立两周年，并引用材料说明这支正在英勇地为希腊自由与独立而战的军队之人员、建制与指挥的情形。广播力称：组织良好的民主军，胜利地抵住了由希腊、英国及美国反动的职业军官所统率的保皇法西斯军。马科斯说：只有象我们这样的军队，才能抵住而且坚毅地击退在人力与装备数量上占有巨大优势的敌人对格拉姆斯山七十天的一切进攻、并使敌人蒙受如下的损失：仅在格拉姆斯前线，被毙伤者即达二万五千名。本年九个月，在全希腊领土内被毙伤者达七万五千余名。据法新社讯：马科斯将军于三十日对民主军发布命令称：“两年战争中，在希腊全境进行战斗的民主军，已毙伤保皇法西斯军十二万人，奠定了从英美占领者及其雅典奴仆的统治下解放全希腊的强固基础。民主军的胜利日子已经不远，而且一天天地接近了。”
