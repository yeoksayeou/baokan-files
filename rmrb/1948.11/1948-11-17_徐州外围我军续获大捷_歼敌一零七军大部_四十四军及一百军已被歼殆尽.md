　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 15th: The enemy's 107th Army, under Sun Liangcheng, which was fleeing from Suining towards Xuzhou, was mostly annihilated by our forces on the 13th. On the 12th, the army headquarters and its 261st Division fled to the Gaoji area, 30 li northwest of Suining, and were surrounded and attacked by our forces. By the 13th, they had all surrendered to us. The 262nd Division of the army, after fleeing to Guanyintang, west of Shuanggou, northwest of Suining, was also largely surrounded and annihilated by our forces.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 14th: The encirclement and annihilation war against the Huang Baitao Corps by our army in the Nianzhuang area east of Xuzhou is continuing fiercely. Our army continued to attack and occupy the Nianzhuang Railway Station and strongholds south of Nianzhuangwei, such as Lizhuang, Caozhuang, and Wangjiazhuang. The enemy's 44th and 100th Armies have been almost entirely annihilated. The remaining enemy forces are now compressed within Nianzhuangwei and a few surrounding villages, with a diameter of only a few li. Although the enemy's Qiu Qingquan and Li @ Corps, which were providing eastern reinforcements from Xuzhou, launched a group charge with five main divisions on a 30 li front, and coordinated with more than ten tanks and a large amount of artillery, they only advanced five li in a day under our strong resistance. Their morale is low. Our powerful reinforcing blocking troops have killed or wounded several thousand enemy soldiers.

　　Furthermore, it is reported that our army shot down a Canadian-made Mosquito aircraft on the Nianzhuang front on the 13th.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 15th: The People's Liberation Army recovered the county seat about 60 li southwest of Xuzhou on the 13th. The defending enemy fled eastward.

　　徐州外围我军续获大捷
    歼敌一零七军大部
  　四十四军及一百军已被歼殆尽
    【新华社淮海前线十五日电】由睢宁向徐州逃跑之敌孙良诚部一零七军已于十三日大部为我歼灭。十二日该军军部及所属二六一师，逃至睢宁西北三十里高集地区，当被我包围攻击，至十三日全部向我投降。该军所属之二六二师逃至睢宁西北双沟以西的观音堂后，亦大部被我包围歼灭。
    【新华社淮海前线十四日电】徐州以东碾庄地区我军对于黄伯韬兵团的围歼战继续猛烈进行中。我军续猛攻占领碾庄车站及碾庄圩以南的李庄、曹庄、王家庄等据点。敌四十四军及一百军已被歼殆尽。残敌现被压缩于碾庄圩及其外围少数村庄内，直径仅数里。由徐州东援之敌邱清泉及李＠两兵团虽以五个主力师在三十里正面，作集团冲锋，并以十余辆坦克及大量炮兵配合，但在我坚强阻击下，一天仅进五里，军心沮丧，我强大阻援部队已毙伤敌数千人。
    又讯：碾庄前线我军，于十三日击落加拿大制蚊式飞机一架。
    【新华社淮海前线十五日电】解放军于十三日收复徐州西南约六十里的县城，守敌向东逃窜。
