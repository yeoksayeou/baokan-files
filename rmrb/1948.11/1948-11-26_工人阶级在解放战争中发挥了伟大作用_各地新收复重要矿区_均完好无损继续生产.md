　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd—The working class played a great role in the People's Liberation War. Just as transportation workers protected transportation vehicles and rapidly restored transportation, coal mine workers diligently protected coal mine equipment and enabled coal mine production to continue. In Fushun, China's largest coal capital, the 36,000 employees of the four major mines and twenty factories secretly organized mine protection committees before liberation, proposing slogans such as "Protecting the mines is protecting our lives," and strictly guarded against sabotage by the Kuomintang bandits. Employees of the rolling stock plant disassembled important parts from the cars, preventing the bandit army from taking away a single one. In addition to organizing round-the-clock guards, many power plant workers prepared hand grenades to resist the bandits' sabotage. When the People's Liberation Army entered Fushun City and the battle was still in progress, the miners continued to work. The well-known Jiaozuo Coal Mine area in northern Henan, as well as the water company, power plant, machine repair shop, and other facilities, were undamaged due to the workers' meticulous protection. The mine is now stepping up coal production to supply military and civilian needs. The Zaozhuang and Jiawang coal mines, liberated in the Huaihai Campaign, are continuing production despite being not far from the front line. The Jiawang Coal Mine, located about sixty li northeast of Xuzhou, was liberated for the first time. After the mine was liberated, because the mine police's weapons were all handed over to the People's Liberation Army, over a thousand employees voluntarily organized to maintain order, repair machinery and materials, and supply water and electricity as usual. The mine's machinery was undamaged, and more than 100,000 tons of coal and 3,000 bags of flour in storage were intact.

　　工人阶级在解放战争中发挥了伟大作用
    各地新收复重要矿区
  　均完好无损继续生产
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】工人阶级在人民解放战争中发挥了伟大作用。和交通工人保护交通工具并迅速恢复了交通一样，煤矿工人努力保护了煤矿的设备，并使煤矿生产得以继续进行。在中国最大的煤都抚顺，四大矿山与二十个工厂的三万六千职工，在解放前曾秘密组织护矿委员会，提出“保护矿山就是保护我们的生命”等口号，严密防范国民党匪帮的破坏。车轮厂职工拆掉车上重要零件，使匪军没有带走一辆车。发电厂职工除日夜组织看守外，很多工人准备了手榴弹，准备反抗匪军的破坏。当解放军攻入抚顺城，战斗尚在进行时，矿工仍继续工作。著名全国的豫北焦作煤矿区及自来水公司、发电厂、机器修理厂等，在工人周密保护下，未受破坏。现该矿正加紧出煤，供应军需民用。在此次淮海战役中解放的枣庄、贾汪煤矿，虽距前线不远，现仍继续生产。其中贾汪煤矿系首次解放，位于徐州东北约六十里。该矿解放后，由于矿警武装都缴给了解放军，千余名员工自动组织起来维持秩序，修置机器物资，照常供水发电。该矿机器均未损坏，库存煤十万余吨、面粉三千袋等物资完好无缺。
