Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhou Front, 8th: In the Jinzhou Campaign, our Jinan blocking forces, with seven days and nights of fighting, shattered Chiang Kai-shek's personally planned six-division rescue of Jinzhou. Blocking the enemy south of Tashan, only thirty to forty miles from Jinzhou Airport, they failed to advance even a single step, creating a glorious example of a blocking battle. When the Jinzhou Campaign began, Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly transferred nine divisions of troops, attempting to relieve the siege of Jinzhou from the northwest. Our powerful army quickly controlled the high ground along the Tashan, Gaoqiao, and Xihai Kou line south of Jinzhou, relying on the Bohai Sea to the left and the Hongluo Mountains to the right, building deep trenches and high fortifications to resolutely block the enemy's northern advance. On October 10th, the Chiang bandits, with six divisions of troops concentrated in Jinxi, including the Independent 95th Division, 198th Division, 157th Division, 8th Division, and Provisional 62nd Division, launched a fierce attack on our controlled Tashan positions under the cover of aircraft, warships, artillery, and tanks. At this time, our blocking forces conducted in-depth mobilization. All commanders and fighters deeply recognized the importance of this blocking battle and resolved to use offensive defense to prevent the enemy from advancing, ensuring that our main force could annihilate the enemy in Jinzhou without any worries. The political organs issued a decision to "Create Heroes of Defensive Warfare" and formulated award banners for "Defending Like Mount Tai" and "Attacking Like Fierce Tigers." Cadres and soldiers, in response to the slogans of Commanders Lin and Luo to "Create a Glorious Example of Unprecedentedly Stubborn Defensive Warfare," were filled with fighting spirit, made plans and resolutions, and engaged in mutual competition between platoons, companies, and squads to kill the enemy. They also launched military democracy, studying how to build fortifications, organize firepower, how to inflict heavy casualties on the enemy, and how to eliminate the enemy in counterattacks. In the battle, our brave soldiers engaged in a fierce struggle with the enemy, fighting for every inch of land, with the spirit of "men are in the position, the position is there," creating countless heroic examples. In the Battle of Dayu Mountain, an enemy battalion seized our prominent offshore position by taking advantage of a gap. Our army then eliminated an enemy ten times our size with an extremely small force and finally recaptured the position. Many combat teams defeated countless blind group charges by the enemy and, during counterattacks, bravely inserted themselves behind enemy lines, threatening the enemy's flanks. Many comrades were wounded multiple times but resolutely remained on the front line. Cadres went to the most critical positions to direct operations, inspiring the soldiers to fight bravely. After the cadres were killed or wounded, the soldiers automatically took over command and led the troops to kill the enemy. Propaganda and mobilization work on the front line was very active, greatly increasing combat morale. In the seven days of fierce fighting, the enemy launched three general offensives and countless small attacks, all of which were repelled by us. Under our heroic and valiant resistance, the six attacking enemy divisions suffered heavy casualties, and their corpses littered the field. In one area only a hundred meters wide, there were hundreds of enemy corpses. At the same time, our army actively launched a political offensive in front of the阵地, distributing leaflets and placing propaganda signs everywhere, shaking the enemy's morale. Five companies of the Independent 95th Division were forced to lay down their arms collectively within our abatis. When the 100,000 defending enemies in Jinzhou were completely annihilated on the 15th, the enemy who had come to rescue Jinzhou from the north, having suffered heavy losses, retreated from our Tashan position the following day. In this campaign, we annihilated a total of 7,700 enemy troops and captured a large number of various guns, artillery, and ammunition, gloriously completing the blocking mission. Our Northeast People's Liberation Army Commanders Lin, Luo, Liu, and Tan specially ordered commendations for all units.

　　锦南阻敌创光辉范例
  　奋战七昼夜敌未能前进一步
    【新华社锦州前线八日电】锦州战役中，我锦南阻击部队以七昼夜奋战，粉碎蒋贼介石亲自部署的六个师的援锦计划。阻敌于离锦州机场仅三四十里之塔山以南地区，始终未能前进一步，创造了阻击战的光辉范例。当锦州战役开始时，蒋贼慌忙调转九个师的兵力，企图从锦西北援以解锦州之围。我军强大兵团即迅速控制锦南之塔山、高桥以南西海口一线高地，左凭渤海，右以红螺山为倚托，深沟高垒，坚决阻击北援之敌。十月十日，蒋匪即以其集中锦西之独九十五师、一九八师、一五七师、第八师、暂六十二师等六个师兵力，在飞机、军舰及大炮、坦克掩护下，向我控制之塔山阵地猛犯。此时我阻击部队即进行深入动员，全体指战员均深刻认识到此一阻击战任务重大，决以攻势防御，阻敌前进，保证我主力毫无顾虑地全歼锦州敌人。政治机关颁发了“创造守备战英雄”的决定，制定“守如泰山”、“攻加猛虎”的奖旗。干部战士为响应林罗首长“创造空前顽强的防御战光辉范例”的口号，战意昂扬，纷纷订计划下决心，班、排、连队互相竞赛杀敌，并展开军事民主，研究如何构筑工事、组织火力，如何大量杀伤敌人及在反击中消灭敌人。在战斗中，我英勇战士和敌人进行寸土必争、人在阵地在的顽强搏斗，出现无数英勇范例。打鱼山之战，敌人一个营乘隙夺取我突出之海上阵地，我军则以极小部队消灭十倍于我之敌，终将阵地夺回。许多战斗小组打垮敌人无数次盲目集团冲锋，并在反击时，英勇插入敌后，威胁敌人翼侧。许多同志负伤多次，仍坚决不下火线。干部到最危急的阵地指挥作战，鼓舞了战士们英勇战斗。干部伤亡后，战士即自动代理指挥，率群杀敌。阵地上的宣传鼓动工作十分活跃，使战斗情绪倍加高涨。在七天的恶战中，敌人曾发动三次总攻及无数次的小攻击，均被我击退。在我英勇壮烈抗击下，进攻之敌六个师遭我重大杀伤，遗尸遍野，某一仅阔百米地带，敌尸即达数百具。与此同时，我军积极展开阵前政治攻势，散发传单，遍插宣传牌，动摇敌军士气。独九十五师之五个连，即在我鹿砦以内被迫集体放下武器。当十五日锦州十万守敌全部就歼后，翌日碰得头破血流的北上援锦之敌遂由我塔山阵地前缩回。是役我共歼敌七千七百余人，缴获各种枪、炮、弹药甚多，光荣完成阻击任务。我东北解放军林罗刘谭首长特传令各部表扬。
