Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 15th: A very important reform has recently been implemented in the railway management of the Northeast Liberated Areas. This is the change from the rotation system (i.e., the large shift system) to the responsibility system (i.e., the assigned engine system) for the use of locomotives. The rotation system involved all crew members (drivers and firemen) of the entire section taking turns using each locomotive in the section, while the inspection, oiling, and cleaning of the locomotive were done by other personnel. The responsibility system, on the other hand, assigns a specific locomotive to a fixed number of crew members (divided into two or three shifts) who are fully responsible for the inspection, oiling, and cleaning of the locomotive themselves. The advantages and disadvantages of these two management methods have been debated among railway management personnel since the Northeast Democratic Government began managing the railways. After more than a year of practical experimentation, the complete correctness of the responsibility system has been proven. Before August of last year, the Linkou Locomotive Depot in Mudanjiang implemented the responsibility system. Coupled with the emergence of a large number of labor heroes and model workers during the merit campaign at that time, the quality of locomotives generally improved, and all kinds of damage were fundamentally eliminated. After September of last year, the depot switched to the rotation system, and phenomena such as wear, damage, and overheating of locomotives increased significantly, and the loss of parts also became a common occurrence. In July of this year alone, among the twenty locomotives in operation at the depot, there were twenty cases of overheating accidents, resulting in an alarming record of consumption. Calculated at the current market price, the material loss caused by each locomotive overheating once amounted to 33.8 million yuan, and twenty times totaled a huge 676 million yuan. And the waste of other accidents, labor, and grease has not yet been calculated. At the end of July this year, under the personal guidance of the sub-bureau chief, the locomotive depot adopted the responsibility system again. As a result of two months of implementation, overheating accidents were quickly eliminated, and the quality of locomotives generally improved again.

Preliminary statistics from the Harbin Railway Bureau also proved that implementing the responsibility system could save one-third in maintenance materials compared to the puppet Manchukuo period. Compared to the rotation system, it can save one-tenth in materials and grease, and one-thirtieth in operating coal, which means that for every 5,000 kilometers, the two combined can save 27 billion yuan.

These practical experiences prove that the adoption of the rotation system greatly reduces the crew members' sense of responsibility and care for the locomotive. Most crew members believe that the locomotive is public property and do not know when they will get it next time. Therefore, they are not familiar with or concerned about the condition of the locomotive. If there is a problem, as long as no accident occurs during their use, they will deal with it until they reach the station. When factory workers repair locomotives, they also adopt a perfunctory approach due to the loss of locomotive parts, the crew members' incomplete filling of repair orders, and the difficulty of obtaining materials. Inspectors are often in the depot and do not understand the operating conditions of the locomotive. They rely on handover reports and inspections, which are difficult to be thorough. In addition, there are too few people and too many locomotives, making it even more difficult to thoroughly inspect and find locomotive problems, so they drag on and use them. As a result, no one is responsible, and wear, damage, and overheating phenomena follow one after another, increasing the failure rate of locomotives, reducing the life and efficiency of locomotives.

The responsibility system is a responsibility system built on the basis of workers' consciousness, which makes crew members very concerned about inspecting and repairing their own locomotives. Because they often use certain locomotives, they have experience in the consumption of grease and overheating of various parts, which makes it easy to prevent possible failures during operations. When taking over the locomotive, the previous shift can explain the details to the next shift; after arriving at the depot, they also write repair orders in detail and report to the inspectors, so that the locomotive can maintain a good condition, extend the life of the locomotive, and increase the tractive force and operating efficiency; the accessories and parts on the locomotive will also not be lost due to the increased sense of responsibility of the crew members. After the implementation of the responsibility system, the crew members are circulating the following saying: "The locomotive is our good friend, we must take care of it and make it beautiful."

### 东北铁路管理实行重要改革　改轮乘制为乘务负责制

　　东北铁路管理实行重要改革
  　改轮乘制为乘务负责制
    【新华社哈尔滨十五日电】东北解放区最近在铁路管理上实行了一个极为重要的改革。这就是将机车使用上的轮乘制（即大轮班制）改为乘务负责制（即包车制）。轮乘制是将全段的每台机车由全段的所有乘务员（开车的和烧火的）轮流使用，而对机车的检查、浇油、擦车等工作则由另外的人员去做。乘务负责制则是将一台车固定交给一定数量的乘务员（他们分成两班或三班）使用，并由他们自己对机车的检查、浇油、擦车等工作负全责。这两种管理方法的优劣问题，自东北民主政府开始管理铁路以来，就一直在铁路管理人员中争论着。经过一年多的实际的试验结果，证明了乘务负责制的完全正确。牡丹江林口机务段在去年八月以前是实行乘务负责制，加上当时立功运动中涌现了大批的劳动英雄及模范工作者，曾使机车质量普遍提高，各种损坏根本消除。去年九月后，该段改用轮乘制，各机车磨耗、破损、发热等现象大增，丢失零件也成为一种普遍现象。仅今年七月间，该段在运用的二十台机车中，发热事故就有二十件，造成了惊人的耗损纪录。按目前市价折算，每台机车发热一次而引起的材料损失值三千三百八十万元，二十次共达六亿七千六百万元之巨。而其他事故、人工、油脂的浪费还未计算在内。今年七月底，该机务段在分局长亲自指导下，再度采用乘务负责制。施行两个月的结果，发热事故迅速消灭，机车质量又普遍提高。
    哈尔滨铁路局的初步统计，也证明了实行乘务负责制比伪满时期可在检修材料上节省三分之一。比轮乘制时，可省材料、油脂十分之一，节省运用煤炭三十分之一，即每五千公里，两者合共节省二百七十亿元。
    这些实际经验证明，采用轮乘制的结果，大大减低了乘务员对机车的责任心和爱护心。乘务员们大多认为机车是公用的，下次不知何时才能轮到，因此对机车状况不熟悉、不关心，如有毛病，只要自己使用的这一次不发生事故，就对付到站完事。工厂员工在修理机车时也由于机车零件的丢失，乘务员填写修车单不具体，再加材料困难，也就采取了应付的办法。检点员经常在段内，对机车运行情况不了解，原凭交机报告和检查很难周到，再加人少车多，更难检查彻底，找不出机车毛病就拖下去使用。结果是无人负责，磨耗、破损、发热现象接踵而起，增加了机车的破损故障率，减低了机车的寿命和使用效率。
    乘务负责制则是建筑在工人自觉基础上的一种责任制，使乘务员非常关心对自己的机车进行检查和修理。他们因经常使用一定的机车，对各部油脂消耗、发热等都有经验，在乘务中易于防止可能发生的故障；接车时，上班能详细地交代给下班；到段后也详细地写修车单和向检点员报告，因而使机车保持良好状态，延长机车寿命，增加曳引力和运行效率；机车上的附属品和零件，亦由于乘务员责任心提高而不致丢失。实行乘务负责制后，乘务员就流行着这样的口头语：“机车是我们的好朋友，要爱护它，要使它漂漂亮亮的”。
