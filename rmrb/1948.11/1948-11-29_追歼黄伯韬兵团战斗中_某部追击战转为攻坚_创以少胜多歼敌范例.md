　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 26th. In the early stages of the Huaihai Campaign, a certain regiment of a certain column of the East China People's Liberation Army fiercely pursued and annihilated Huang Botao's Corps. On the 8th, at Chenlou Village, north of Pao Che, in Pi County, they annihilated four companies (missing two platoons) of the 324th Regiment of the 108th Division of Huang's rearguard 25th Army. At dawn on the 10th, they completely annihilated the entire 130th Regiment of the 44th Division of the 100th Army and parts of the 131st and 132nd Regiments, who were covering the crossing of the canal at Yunhe Station. They killed or wounded 1,200 enemy soldiers, captured more than 1,500 enemy soldiers, and seized 90 light and heavy machine guns, more than 30 mortars, and 60mm guns. The regiment only suffered 20 casualties, creating a brilliant example of fierce pursuit and continuous annihilation of the enemy, enabling our army to quickly cross the canal, track down and pursue the enemy, and rapidly form a complete encirclement of Huang Botao's Corps.
    The 9th Company of the regiment captured more than 250 enemy soldiers alone in the Battle of Chenlou. In particular, the 1st Platoon of the 9th Company quickly completed a breakthrough during the battle. Chen Shengwen, the squad leader of the 1st Platoon, led the entire squad in a fierce attack and achieved a victory of annihilating an enemy company and a heavy machine gun platoon single-handedly. In the Battle of Chenlou, the 9th Company was tasked with attacking from the north of the village. At that time, Chen Shengwen of the 1st Platoon mobilized the entire squad: "After the blasting, we must charge fiercely, maintain a good combat formation, take turns attacking the enemy, and not let the enemy catch their breath." When the attack began, demolition men Wang Fengchi and Mao Xiushi used five consecutive blasts to destroy the enemy's enclosure and courtyard walls. Another demolition man, Liu Zhaobin, braved the enemy's fierce artillery fire and rushed up to blow up the enemy's bunker, which they were stubbornly holding on to. At that time, the three groups of the entire squad immediately rushed up like three arrows, dodging left and right, and occupied four houses. Squad leader Chen Shengwen then ordered the machine gun to be set up in the front, and the third group blocked both sides of the alley where the enemy entered and exited, compressing the enemy into a house, while the first and second groups launched an attack, forcing an enemy company and a heavy machine gun platoon to lay down their weapons. The entire squad suffered no casualties. After the war, they were rated as a first-class collective meritorious service and awarded the title of "Flying Tiger First Squad." The main key to the regiment's victory in consecutive battles was summarized as maintaining a constantly full combat organization and high combat morale through the method of adjusting and reorganizing and evaluating during the war. For example, after the 9th Company of the regiment fought in Chenlou, they immediately conducted a merit evaluation in the gap between the wars, held a celebration meeting, adjusted the combat organization, promoted the deputy squad leader of the 1st Platoon, who had established combat merits, to squad leader, and promoted several acting squad leaders and three deputy squad leaders, maintaining the integrity of the establishment.
    The column headquarters issued a circular of commendation for the regiment's victory in fiercely pursuing and annihilating the enemy, praising it as "one of the paradigms of turning pursuit warfare into fortification warfare, and defeating the enemy with fewer troops." The commendation order pointed out that the main reasons why the regiment was able to achieve this victory were:
    1. In terms of command, they grasped the characteristics of the enemy's rout, were consistent from top to bottom, resolutely completed the task, overcame fatigue, and overcame difficulties. After crossing the Yi River, the regiment continued to pursue the enemy for eighty miles, learning about the situation while fighting, and especially demonstrated the vigorous spirit of attacking with no retreat, overcoming material difficulties, boldly encircling, and bravely attacking.
    2. The widespread development of revolutionary heroism competition and mass on-the-spot mobilization work, so the combat morale was always high, and the more they fought, the stronger they became. The regimental committee personally mobilized and distributed frontline leaflets in a timely manner. After the platoon leader of the "Li Gan Platoon" in the regiment died in battle, the heroic Wang @ping of the platoon immediately put forward the slogan of "Maintaining the glory of the Li Gan Platoon and avenging the heroic sacrifice of the platoon leader," and the entire platoon strove to be the first. After the end of the battle, the 2nd Battalion of the regiment conducted a merit evaluation that night and assigned special cadres to be responsible for collecting battlefield materials in an orderly manner for submission.
    3. Timely launch a frontline political offensive to force the enemy to surrender in batches.

### 追歼黄伯韬兵团战斗中　某部追击战转为攻坚  创以少胜多歼敌范例

　　追歼黄伯韬兵团战斗中
  　某部追击战转为攻坚  创以少胜多歼敌范例
    【新华社淮海前线二十六日电】华东人民解放军某纵队某团，于淮海战役开始时，猛勇追歼敌黄伯韬兵团中，于八日在邳县属之炮车以北陈楼村，歼黄匪后卫二十五军一零八师三二四团四个连（缺两个排）。十日拂晓，又在运河车站全歼敌掩护渡河的一百军四十四师一三○团全部及一三一、一三二团各一部，毙伤敌一千二百名，俘敌一千五百多名，缴轻重机枪九十挺，迫击炮、六零炮等三十余门。而该团仅伤二十人，创猛勇追击、连续歼敌的光辉范例，使我军得以迅速通过运河，跟踪追击敌人，迅速形成对黄伯韬兵团的完全包围。
    该团九连在陈楼之战中，单独俘敌达二百五十余名。特别是九连的第一班在作战中迅速完成突破，一班长陈圣文率全班猛打猛冲，获得单独歼敌一个连和一个重机枪排的胜利。陈楼之战九连担任从村北突击的任务。当时该连一班陈圣文就动员全班：“爆破后要猛冲，保持好战斗队形，轮番打击敌人，不让敌人喘气。”攻击开始，爆破员王凤池、毛秀实即以五次连续爆破，炸毁敌人围子与院墙。另一爆破员刘兆彬又冒敌猛烈炮火冲上去，炸倒了敌人凭据顽抗的碉楼。是时，全班三个组，立即象三支箭头似的轮番地左闪右闪地冲上去，攻占四处房屋。班长陈圣文乃命令把机枪架在正面，第三组堵住敌人出入的巷子两边，把敌人压缩在一座房子里，第一、二两组则进行突击，迫使敌一个连和一个重机枪排放下了武器。全班无一伤亡。战后被评为一等集体功，获得“飞虎第一班”的称号。该团总结连战获胜的主要关键，系由于在连续作战中，以随战随整、随打随评办法，保持了部队经常充实的战斗组织与高涨的战斗情绪。如该团九连在陈楼作战后，便立即在战争空隙中进行了评功，召开了庆功会，调整了战斗组织，把建立战功的一班副班长提升为班长，并提拔了几个代理班长和三个班副，保持了建制的健全。
    纵队司令部对该团猛勇追歼的胜利，特予通令嘉奖，誉之为“追击战又转为攻坚战，并又以少胜多的范例之一”。嘉奖令指出，该团所以能取得这一胜利，主要原因为：
    一、指挥上抓住敌人溃逃的特点，上下一致，坚决完成任务，克服疲劳，克服困难。渡过沂河后，该团复连续八十里追击敌人，边打边了解情况，特别表现有进无退、克服器材困难、大胆包围、勇猛攻击的旺盛突击精神。
    二、普遍开展革命英雄主义的竞赛和群众性的火线鼓动工作，因而战斗情绪始终旺盛，越战越强。团委亲自动员，及时散发火线传单。该团“李干排”排长在战斗中殉职后，该排英雄王＠平即提出“保持李干排的光荣，为英勇牺牲的排长复仇”的口号，全排即个个争先。该团二营于战斗结束后，当晚即进行评功，并派专门干部负责搜集战场物资，做到有秩序的上缴。
    三、及时进行火线政治攻势，迫使敌人成批投降。
