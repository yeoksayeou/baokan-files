Jinnan District Party Committee Notifies Local and County Committees
Emphasize Party Newspaper Criticism and Inquiries

[Jinnan Electric Dispatch] The Jinnan District Party Committee emphasizes Party newspaper criticism, pointing out: The Handan County Committee and the Third District Committee's attitude of ignoring the People's Daily's criticism and inquiries is wrong and must be corrected. It also notified all local and county committees and all work departments that they must, from now on, treat all criticisms and inquiries from Party newspapers with a serious, conscientious, and responsible attitude. The notice stated: From the People's Daily article of October 25th, "Please the Third District Committee of Jinnan to Inspect and Reply," it can be seen that the Handan County Committee and the Third District Committee adopted the erroneous attitude of ignoring the criticisms and inquiries of the Party newspaper. Regarding the problems of villages around Handan, if they have different materials and opinions from the People's Daily, they should provide the materials to the Party newspaper and express their attitude. If there are no different opinions, they should conduct in-depth investigations based on the Party newspaper's instructions and earnestly solve the problems. In addition to agreeing with the opinions raised by the People's Daily to the Third District Committee, we specifically notify all local and county committees and all work departments that in the future, when dealing with the criticisms and inquiries of Party newspapers (People's Daily, New Dazhong Daily, Jinnan Daily), they must work according to the following points: 1. All county Party committee members and heads of departments must treat all criticisms and inquiries from Party newspapers with a serious, conscientious, and responsible attitude, and oppose any negligent, dismissive, liberalistic attitude. 2. They must immediately conduct inspection work based on the points of criticism and inquiry, and with the spirit of Bolshevik self-criticism, correct mistakes, improve work, and reply to the Party newspaper. 3. If the Party newspaper's criticisms are inconsistent with the facts, or if the Party committee or department in question has opinions inconsistent with the Party newspaper, they should immediately provide the relevant materials to the Party newspaper to help the Party newspaper clarify the truth of the matter.
