　　Democratic Government Support
  　Anping Recovers Horsehair Gauze Industry
    [Jizhong Telegram] Anping's famous specialty, the horsehair gauze industry, is flourishing under the support of the democratic government, becoming one of the main sideline occupations for the county's flood-stricken areas to survive the famine. The county's horsehair gauze industry has a history of 160 years. Raw materials come from places such as Northwest Kou, Northeast, Shandong, Xuzhou, and Zhoukou in Henan. At that time, horsehair was sold in two ways: one was to process raw horsehair into finished products and transport them to Tianjin for sale abroad; the other was to weave horsehair into gauze bottoms and sell them to Shandong, Shanxi, Northeast, Northwest and other places. The horsehair gauze industry became even more developed between 1926 and 1927. In Wanghulin Village alone, there were five major firms such as Wandecheng (which were capitalist enterprises), each with a regular workforce of 100 workers. Large quantities of horsehair were often loaded onto ships and transported to Tianjin. In addition, no less than 70 households in the whole village did handicraft work. Wanghulin Village had four major firms such as Fuxinglong, and Shuangyixing alone had more than 200 handicraft workers. In villages such as Wanggezhuang, Qianchengan, and Zhangjiawo, there were many groups of three or five households doing handicraft work together. Some people opened horsehair shops in Harbin, Tianjin and other places. In more than 50 villages in the county, thousands of people went to horsehair shops to work as apprentices, and as many as 2,000 households engaged in the horsehair business, with huge incomes. The villages along the Hutuo River, such as Da Huiwo, Xiao Huiwo, Pengting, and Liting, suffered floods in nine out of ten years, and survived the floods of previous years by weaving gauze. After the July 7th Incident, the Japanese invaders occupied Anping County, traffic was cut off, and the Japanese and puppet authorities extorted money, causing the collapse of Anping's horsehair gauze industry. After the liberation of Anping County in 1945, with the support of the democratic government, Anping's horsehair gauze industry recovered again, mostly with small-scale weavers operated by three or five households jointly or individually. The county's cooperative set up a horsehair section to specialize in purchasing cow and horsehair, processing it into finished horsehair, and supplying it to weaving households in various villages. It also adopted a method of trading raw materials for finished products, exchanging one jin of gauze bottom for one jin of horsehair, plus a manual fee of six liang to half a jin of rice for each gauze bottom. In this way, the weaving industry in various villages has recovered. According to statistics in 1947, a total of 183,959 pieces of horsehair gauze and 16,200 bolts of corduroy gauze bottom were produced in nine months of the year, with a total profit of more than 30 million yuan. This year, in order to enable weaving households to turn around in time, the county promotion agency used the method of exchanging horsehair for gauze, in addition to sitting in government offices and going to the countryside to collect gauze bottoms, it mainly relied on going to market to trade. Fu Gezhuang market in the third district has long been a trading market for horsehair gauze bottoms. Now, women from various villages who weave gauze go to the market to exchange for horsehair. Usually, more than 60 jin of horsehair are exchanged for more than 2,000 gauze bottoms at each market. In more than 50 villages in the county, there were more than 1,800 weaving households (not including more than 300 households weaving silk gauze) and more than 2,000 looms. The county promotion agency has mobilized more than one-third of them, and the products are very high. There are five types of products: white big gauze, face gauze bottom, and Hua gauze, which are sold to Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Northeast, Northwest, and Southern Hebei. The weaving industry has become the main sideline occupation for women. Usually, each person can weave seven or eight pieces a day, and fast workers can weave eleven or twelve pieces. Xiao Huiwo, a poor village that has suffered floods in nine out of ten years, has not only survived the floods of previous years because of weaving gauze, but some have also become rich. For example, Yang Da Kui's family has two people, planting nine mu of barren land, producing little grain, and supporting six children, all relying on weaving gauze bottoms to make a living. Now they have added sixteen mu of land, and life is very good. Seventy percent of the eighty-two women in the village can weave gauze, and there are thirty-five looms in operation. Some have also been organized. According to statistics from the county promotion agency, as of the end of September, a total of 145,536 gauze bottoms have been collected. In order to turn around in time and expand sales, the county promotion agency set up a branch sales office in Linqing, Southern Hebei, and sent people to Changzhu in Wuding Prefecture, Shandong, to transport the gauze bottoms for sale. From the first month of this year to now, the Linqing branch sales office alone has sold more than 80,000 gauze bottoms. In order to overcome this year's famine, the county promotion agency is vigorously supporting the weaving industry for women in flood-stricken areas.

　　民主政府扶植下
  　安平恢复马尾罗业
    【冀中电】安平著名特产马尾罗业，在民主政府扶植下日益发达，成为该县水灾区渡荒的主要副业之一。该县马尾罗业有一百六十年的历史。原料来自西北口、东北、山东、徐州、河南周口等地。当时马尾出售分为两种：一是将生马尾做成熟货，运往天津销售国外；一是用马尾织成罗底，行销山东、山西、东北、西北等地。民国十五六年间，马尾罗业更加发达。只王胡林一村就有万德成等五家大字号（系资本主义企业性质），各号经常有工人一百名。大批马尾经常装船运往天津。另外全村做手工的不下七十多家。王胡林村有复兴隆等四大字号，只双义兴一号就有做手工工人二百多个。王各庄、前呈干、张家涡等村，三五家插伙做手工的也不少。有的到哈尔滨、天津等地开马尾号。该县五十余村，有数千人到马尾号做手工学徒，做马尾业的达二千余户，收入极大。沿滹沱河大、小会涡、彭町、李町等村十年九涝，以织罗渡过了历年的水灾。七七事变后，日寇侵占安平县城，交通断绝，加上日伪勒索，使安平的马尾罗业垮台。民国卅四年安平县城解放后，在民主政府扶植下，安平马尾罗业又恢复起来，多为三五家合股经营或单独经营的小规模织罗者。县联社单设一个马尾股，专门采买牛马尾，做成熟马尾，供给各村织罗户。并采用了原料换成品交易办法，一斤罗底换一斤马尾，另外给手工费，每一个罗底六两到半斤米。这样，各村织罗业恢复起来。据一九四七年统计，全年九个月共产马尾罗十八万三千九百五十九个，产绠子罗底一万六千二百匹，共得利三千多万元。今年该县为使织罗户及时周转，县推进社用马尾换罗的方式，除在机关座等和下乡收罗底外，主要是靠赶集交易。三区付各庄集早就是马尾罗底的交易市场，现在每集各村织罗的妇女都赶集去换马尾，平常一集就换出马尾六十来斤，换回罗底二千多个。全县五十多村，旧有一千八百多织罗户（未包括织绢罗的三百多户），二千多张机子，县推进社已带动起来了三分之一以上，产品都很高。共产白大罗、面罗底、华罗等五种，行销山东、山西、河南、东北、西北、冀南等地。织罗业已成为妇女的主要副业。平常每人每天能织七、八个，快的能织十一、二个。十年九涝的穷村小会涡，因为织罗不但渡过了历年的水灾，有的还发家致富了。如杨大奎家两口人，种九亩薄地，打粮食不多，弄着六个孩子，全凭织罗底过日子。到现在添了十六亩地，日子过的很好。该村八十二个妇女，会织罗的占十分之七，活动着机子三十五张。有的并已组织起来。据该县推进社统计，截至九月底，共收罗底十四万五千五百三十六个。为及时周转，扩大销路，县推进社在冀南临清设一分销处，又派人到山东无定府常驻，把罗底运去销售。从今年正月到现在，只临清分销处卖八万多罗底。为渡过今年灾荒，县推进社正大力扶植水灾区妇女织罗业。
