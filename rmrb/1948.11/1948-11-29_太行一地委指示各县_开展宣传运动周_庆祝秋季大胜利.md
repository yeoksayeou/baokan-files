Taihang First Prefecture Committee Directs All Counties to Launch Propaganda Campaign Week to Celebrate Great Autumn Victory

[Taihang News] In order to celebrate the great victory of the autumn offensive, the Taihang First Prefecture Committee issued instructions on the 20th, calling on all counties to launch a planned and organized propaganda campaign week. It requires all counties to, with the county party committee propaganda minister, county head, and education section chief as the lead, hold emergency meetings to formulate propaganda content based on the spirit of the instructions and make specific plans, which should be communicated at each level. Secondly, convene a mobilization meeting of propaganda and education cadres throughout the county, organize some comrades with writing skills to collectively create and write some allegros, ditties, lyrics, etc. suitable for the masses, for use in disguised propaganda, student recitations, wall writings, and blackboard broadcasts. Organize celebrations in various villages, communicate current affairs, focus on winter studies, organize discussions and forums, and resolve ideological problems of the masses. Junior normal schools and higher primary schools should organize various forms of propaganda teams to carry out propaganda in nearby villages and towns. Propaganda rallies must be held at county and district government residences, with responsible cadres attending to give reports.

Regarding the content: it should be basically based on the central government's comments on the fundamental overthrow of the Kuomintang government in about a year, and the instructions of the Propaganda Department of the Regional Party Committee, as well as the "Domestic Week" in the People's Daily since the autumn offensive, materials from each major battle, especially the news on the 16th of this month in the People's Daily "China's Last Autocratic Dynasty is on the Verge of Collapse," and the rapidly developing war situation. In short, it should explain the problem of about one year from the living facts of victorious development. In the propaganda, it can be loudly proposed that national victory is coming quickly, and all the people must actively join the army and participate in the war.

During the propaganda week, the Propaganda Department should pay attention to the collection and summarization of the masses' ideological materials and propaganda experience.

　　太行一地委指示各县
  　开展宣传运动周  庆祝秋季大胜利
    【太行讯】为庆祝秋季攻势的伟大胜利，太行一地委于廿号发出指示，号召各县开展一个有计划、有组织的宣传运动周。要求各县以县委宣传部长、县长、教育科长为首，召开紧急会议，以指示精神制定宣传内容，作出具体计划，逐级传达。其次召开全县宣教干部动员大会，组织部分有写作能力同志，集体创作，编写些适合群众口味的快板、小调、歌词之类的东西，以供化装宣传、学生宣唱、墙头涂写、板报广播之用。组织各村开庆祝大会，传达时事，抓紧冬学、组织讨论、座谈、解决群众思想问题。简师高小组织各种形式的宣传队，到附近村庄及较近集镇进行宣传，县区机关驻地，必须召开宣传大会，负责干部出席报告。
    关于内容问题：基本上以中央关于一年左右即可根本上打倒国民党政府的评论，及区党委宣传部的指示为主，并参考人民日报秋季攻势以来的“国内一周”，每个大战役的材料，特别是本月十六日人民日报“中国最后专制王朝濒临覆没”的一条消息，以及正在迅速发展着的战争情况等。总之应从活生生的胜利发展具体事实中来说明一年左右的问题。在宣传中可以响亮提出全国胜利迅速到来，全体人民必须积极参军、参战。
    在宣传周过程中，宣传部应注意群众思想材料与宣传经验的搜集总结。
