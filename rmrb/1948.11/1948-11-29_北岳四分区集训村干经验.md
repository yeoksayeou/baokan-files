Experience of Village Cadre Training in the Fourth Sub-district of the Northern Yue Region
    Research Office of the Fourth District Committee

    In order to carry out party rectification and conclude the land reform, the counties in the Fourth Sub-district of the Northern Yue Region successively held village cadre training classes. Qu Yang, Fu Ping and other five counties trained a total of 2,065 people and gained the following preliminary experience:

    At the beginning of the training, first understand the ideological situation of the trainees. Most party member cadres cannot correctly understand the policy of party rectification. For example, some believe that party rectification is of no benefit, some are dissatisfied with their superiors and think that party rectification is intended to "move stones," some come to the training with the attitude of "seeking redress" and "complaining," and a few party members and cadres with serious mistakes are afraid of being "rectified" in the training class. Some try to avoid coming, and some come with the idea of "sailing according to the wind."

    In short, the party member cadres who came to participate in the training were not only dissatisfied with the performance of having been "moved stones," but most of those who had not been moved emphasized that they could not understand it ideologically. And some of the cadres who had been reinstated still had negative or retaliatory emotions.

    Based on the above ideological situation, the following steps and methods were determined for the training:

    (1) First, report on current events and the principles of party rectification to stabilize everyone's emotions.

    Regarding the sequence of courses in the training classes in various regions, except for a few counties that put the issue of the situation last, most started by talking about the situation at the beginning of the training. This played a considerable role in boosting morale. At the same time, the party rectification course should be placed before the course on concluding land reform, in order to eliminate the initial dissatisfaction and suspicion of the students when they first arrive at the school. Experience has proved that only by first conducting situation reports and party rectification courses to stabilize everyone's emotions and improve their interest in learning, and then conducting courses such as concluding land reform, will it be easier to be accepted.

    (2) Leaders should conduct self-criticism to encourage everyone to offer opinions to their heart's content.

    When conducting the party rectification course, the county party committee should first conduct sincere self-criticism of certain deviations and errors in the land reform and party rectification, and encourage everyone to offer opinions and speak their minds. In this way, on the one hand, it eliminates prejudice and concerns about the leadership, and allows them to calmly recognize and discuss problems; on the other hand, it also exposes their thoughts, which is convenient for solving problems. Experience has proven that the more the leadership can make profound self-criticism and allow everyone to vent their grievances without reservation, the easier it is to transition to everyone's self-criticism. After this step, when calling on everyone to examine themselves humbly, they will generally be able to examine themselves willingly and sincerely.

    (3) Rely on backbone members to take the lead and set examples to carry out self-criticism.

    When the trainees were transitioning from venting their grievances to examining themselves, the leadership closely relied on the backbone members and better elements that had emerged to play a leading role. When a group in Qu Yang discussed "why work could not be completed," everyone initially only blamed the poor peasant leagues without any self-criticism. In this situation, the branch secretary of Zhongheli Village said: "I think the work in the village is not going well because our party members have not worked hard. I am like this myself, just standing on the big high hill watching the fun!" This led everyone to turn to self-criticism.

    Continue to discover pace-setting activists in the discussion and encourage them to make typical reflections at the general meeting. This has a very profound educational significance for some old cadres who have pessimistic, negative, and retaliatory emotions, and can effectively promote the development of criticism and self-criticism.

    (4) Ask questions from the side to provide enlightenment.

    In Ping Shan, when discussing the achievements of land reform and party rectification, most people remained silent. Some village cadres in the first district who were more literate copied and read from written notes. In this situation, the leadership flexibly asked questions from the side: Did the poor peasants get land and turn themselves around last year? Why do the peasants have so many opinions about our branch? Why did some of the retaliatory elements have the support of some of the masses at the beginning? After this enlightenment, the mood of the cadres became more lively, a large number of impure situations within the party were revealed, and the improved living conditions of the poor and hired peasants after the land distribution were discussed. Naturally, the correct conclusion was reached that last year's land reform and party rectification had achieved great results, refuting the fallacy that land reform and party rectification were "a complete mess."

    (5) Conduct specific analysis and mutual comparison to strengthen the unity of new and old cadres.

    In Ping Shan, when village cadres criticized and examined the leadership, many old cadres regarded the new cadres as "completely dark" and harbored retaliatory thoughts. The leadership guided them to conduct specific analysis and compare the May review led by the old cadres with this land reform implementation. This reversed everyone's thinking. Everyone unanimously realized that the new cadres had contributed to completing the tasks of equally distributing land, expanding the army, and providing stretchers for the expedition. New and old cadres should unite and work hard. This changed the view of hating new cadres and began to turn to self-examination.

    (6) Conduct more individual talks before and after meetings.

    In the development of the criticism and self-criticism movement, the responsible comrades of the county and district must also pay attention to conducting individual talks with those who were severely hit in the land reform and whose thinking is difficult to quickly reverse, and patiently help them to understand their thoughts. For example, the village chief of Zhanli Village in the Second District of Qu Yang did not say a word when he came to the training class, but after individual talks, his emotions became higher.

    (7) Organize forces to make a breakthrough in lagging groups.

    In the discussion process of the Fu Ping training class, the leadership participated in the groups with more complex problems and where ideological struggle could not be launched in a planned and focused manner, in order to untie ideological knots. Or use the method of combining groups, combining the lagging groups with the groups that spoke actively and correctly, in order to open up the cadres' thinking.

    (8) Commend model party members to encourage a forward-looking mood.

    The Ping Shan County Party Committee commended the model trainee Liu Baoshan in the training class and awarded him a red flag, praising him as a "model of upholding the truth and correcting mistakes," encouraging the cadres' enthusiasm for progress and enhancing their confidence in party rectification.

    (Editor's note: This article provides some experience in the methods and ways of training village cadres, but how to fundamentally correct certain wrong understandings of village cadres in order to improve their level of awareness and reach the level that a communist party member should have is not adequately addressed, and this is precisely the main and fundamental purpose of party rectification.)

　　北岳四分区集训村干经验
    四地委研究室
    为了进行整党与结束土改，北岳四分区各县先后举行了村干训练班，曲阳、阜平等五县，计共训了二○六五人，并获得初步经验如下：
    训练开始，首先了解学员思想情况，多数党员干部不能正确了解整党政策，如有的认为整党没一点好处，有的不满上级，认为整党是要“搬石头”，有的抱着“伸冤”“诉苦”的态度来受训，少数有严重错误的党员、干部，则怕到训练班“挨整”，有的企图逃避不来，有的来了则抱着“看风驶船”的思想。
    总之，来参加集训的党员干部，不但被搬过“石头”的表现不满，多数没被搬过的也强调思想上搞不通；而一部分已复职的干部也仍存在着消极或报复的情绪。
    根据以上思想情况，确定了训练的步骤方法：
    （一）首先报告时事与整党方针，安定大家情绪。
    各地训练班课程的序列，除个别县份把形势问题放在最后报告外，大多数是在训练一开始即先讲形势。这在鼓励情绪上起了相当大的作用。同时应把整党课程放在结束土改的课程之前，以便消除学员初到校时不满和怀疑的心理。经验证明：只有首先进行形势报告和整党的课程，使大家稳定了情绪提高了学习兴趣，然后再进行结束土改等课程，就会更容易被接受。
    （二）领导上自我检讨，启发大家尽情提意见。
    在进行整党课程时，县委首先将土改整党中的某些偏向与错误，进行诚恳的自我批评，启发大家提意见，说出内心的话。这样一方面消除了对领导上的成见和顾虑，能平心静气的认识和讨论问题，另一方面也暴露了他们的思想，便于解决问题。经验证明：越是领导上能做深刻的自我批评，并能让大家毫无保留的把牢骚发完，也越是容易过渡到大家的自我检讨。经过这一步骤，再号召大家虚心的检讨自己时，一般的都能够心悦诚服虚心检讨。
    （三）依靠骨干带头、典型示范，开展自我检讨。
    在学员尽情发牢骚过渡到他们检讨自己的时候，领导上紧紧依靠已涌现出来的骨干和较好分子起带头作用。曲阳一个小组在讨论“为什么工作不能完成”时，大家开始只责备贫农团，而无丝毫自我批评精神；在此种情况下，中河流村支书说：“我看村里工作闹不好，是咱们党员没使劲干，我个人就是这样儿，只站在大高岗上看笑话呢！”于是带动大家转入了自我批评。
    在讨论中继续发现培赛积极分子，鼓励他们到大会上做典型反省。这对存在着悲观、消极、报复情绪的某些老干部，有极深刻的教育意义，并能有力的推动批评与自我批评的开展。
    （四）从侧面提问题，进行启发。
    平山在开始讨论土改整党成绩时，多数人默不作声，一区有些识字较多的村干，就照抄写的笔记宣读，在这种情况下，领导上灵活的从侧面提出去年贫农分了地翻了身没有？农民为什么对我们支部有很多意见？为什么开始时报复分子还有部分群众拥护？经过这一启发，干部情绪转趋活泼，大量的揭发了党内不纯的情况，讨论了贫雇农分地后生活上升的情况，自然而然的得出了去年土改整党有很大成绩的正确结论，驳斥了土改整党“一团糟”的谬论。
    （五）具体分析与互相对比，加强新老干部团结。
    平山在村干批评、检查领导时，不少老干部把新干部视为“漆黑一团”，并存在着报复思想。领导上引导他们进行具体分析，并把老干部所领导的五月复查与此次土改实行比较，于是扭转了大家的思想。大家一致认识到：新干部完成平分土地、扩军、远征担架等任务，是有功劳的。新老干部应当团结一致，好好工作。于是转变了仇视新干部的观点，并开始转向检讨自己。
    （六）会议前后多做个别谈话。
    在批评与自我批评运动的开展中，对某些因在土改中被打击较重、思想一时难以迅速扭转者，县区负责同志还必须注意进行个别谈话，耐心帮助他们搞通思想。如曲阳二区占里村长，来训练班开始一言不发，经过个别谈话以后，情绪转高。
    （七）组织力量突击落后组。
    阜平训练班在讨论过程中，领导上有计划有重点的参加问题比较复杂、思想斗争开展不起来的小组，以求做到解开思想疙瘩。或者利用合组的办法，把落后的组与发言积极、正确的组合编起来，以此打通干部的思想。
    （八）表扬模范党员，鼓励前进的情绪。
    平山县委在训练班表扬了模范学员刘宝山，并奖给红旗一面，誉为“坚持真理，改正错误的模范”，鼓励了干部前进的热忱，增强了对整党信心。
    （编者按：此文在集训村干的方法方式上提供了一些经验，但如何从根本上纠正村干部的某些错误认识，以提高其觉悟程度，达到共产党员应有的水平，则说得极不够，而这恰是整党的主要的基本的目的。）
