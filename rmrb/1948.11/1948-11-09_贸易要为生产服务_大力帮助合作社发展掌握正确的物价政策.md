[North Yue Telegram] The North Yue District Trading Company convened a meeting of over 70 cadres, including managers, accountants, and section chiefs from its subordinate stores, in early last month to convey the resolutions of the North China Trade Conference, summarize the work of the past six months, and discuss and formulate business plans for the second half of the year. The meeting pointed out that various tasks within the trade system had begun a new transformation in the past six months, manifested in overcoming the capitalistic, purely profit-seeking viewpoint in business ideology, emphasizing the fostering and development of production, clarifying the interests of producers, distributors, and consumers, and affirming the leading role of public enterprises, achieving certain results. Public sector figures have increased unprecedentedly, with market sales of grain, salt, cotton, and oil reaching over 60 million jin, providing strong support for stabilizing the prices of major commodities. In supporting production, it actively promoted sideline and handicraft products, increasing people's income. In supporting the front lines, it directly dispatched large numbers of cadres with the army during each battle to supply non-staple food. In the past six months, it supplied over 410,000 jin of edible oil and over 470,000 jin of salt, with a total price subsidy of over 1.86 billion yuan, ensuring the quantitative supply of non-staple food for the troops. Secondly, through examining the shortcomings of past work, the meeting clarified many issues in the cadres' minds: First, it gained a more systematic understanding of the New Democratic economy, especially a deeper understanding of the relationship between public enterprises, cooperatives, and stores. The meeting considered that the relationship between public stores and cooperatives in the past was not good, criticizing the prejudice of some comrades against cooperatives and their lack of understanding that cooperatives are one of the best organizational forms for organizing and developing production. It decided that all public stores must establish normal and close business relationships with cooperatives in the future, and vigorously supporting the development of cooperatives is the task of state-owned stores, only in this way will state-owned stores not become capitalistic operations. On the issue of private merchants, it clarified the need to grasp the reasonable price difference between the two regions, so that legitimate merchants can make a profit, in order to achieve smooth flow of materials. It also clearly pointed out that speculative and hoarding illegitimate merchants should be cracked down on. Second, it clarified the correct view that trade serves production, examining and criticizing the relief, patronage, and purely profit-seeking views in supporting production; and emphasized that supporting production in the future must be based on sales and social needs. For products that lack sales and have no prospects, blind purchasing should not be carried out. When receiving goods, different prices should be set according to different grades to improve the quality of products. At the same time, it proposed that it is necessary to conduct in-depth investigation and research to open up sales channels for raw materials, and not to use "determining business according to sales" as an excuse for not supporting production and not actively finding sales channels for raw materials. Third, it implemented the enterprise-oriented thinking of precise planning and scientific management. Under the general policy of developing production and supporting the war, it strengthened business management and gradually moved towards enterprise orientation. The meeting summarized the experience of stabilizing prices in the past six months, opposing the blind and mechanical stabilization based on subjective wishes on the one hand, and the idea of fixing prices in the case of unbalanced income and expenditure in the war situation. On the other hand, it is also necessary to oppose the idea of allowing it to rise and fall, letting it go unchecked, and not controlling the market. In the future, it is necessary to grasp objective laws and regional differences, and based on market conditions, add subjective efforts, that is, the management and control of the market, to prevent drastic increases and decreases in prices. The meeting formulated a business plan from September to May next year based on current tasks and specific circumstances, and systematically stipulated accounting information and work report systems. It appropriately adjusted the organization to adapt to the development of the work.
On the work style of store cadres, the meeting made a more profound examination, cracking down on bureaucratic and institutionalized work styles, and proposed strengthening cadres, transforming work styles, and learning to do business. It also required cadres to strengthen the study of theory and policies, strengthen the cultivation of ideological consciousness, overcome the state of disorganization and indiscipline, and constantly improve themselves in their work to prepare themselves to undertake more important tasks.

　　贸易要为生产服务
  　大力帮助合作社发展掌握正确的物价政策
    【北岳电】北岳区贸易公司于上月上旬召集所属各商店经理、会计、股长等七十余干部开会，传达华北贸易会议的决议，总结半年工作，讨论与制定下半年的业务计划。会议指出：半年来贸易系统各项工作开始了新的转变：表现在经营思想上克服了资本主义式的单纯营利观点，重视了扶植与发展生产，明确了照顾生产者、运销者、消费者的三方面利益，及公营企业的领导作用，并获得一定成绩。公营数字已空前增大，仅市场销出粮、盐、棉、油即达六千余万斤，给稳定主要商品价格以有力支持。在扶植生产中，积极推销了副业及手工业产品，增加了人民收入。在支援前线上，历次战役均直接派出大批干部，随军前往供应副食。半年中共供给食油四十一万多斤，盐四十七万多斤，共赔价十八亿六千余万元，保证了部队定量的副食供给。其次，会议经过对过去工作中缺点的检查，使干部思想上明确了不少问题：一、对新民主主义经济有了比较系统的了解，特别是对公营企业与合作社、商店的关系有了比较深刻的认识。会议认为过去公营商店与合作社的关系是不好的，批评了某些同志对合作社带有成见的看法，不了解合作社是组织生产、发展生产最好的组织形式之一，决定今后各公营商店必须与合作社建立正常的密切的业务关系，大力扶植合作社的发展，是国营商店的任务，只有这样作，国营商店才不至变成资本主义式的经营。对私商问题上，明确了掌握两地物价合理差额，使正当商人有利可图，以达到物资畅流。并明确指出：对囤集居奇投机倒把的不正当商人，应给以打击。二、明确了贸易为生产服务的正确观点，检查与批判了扶植生产中的救济观点、恩赐观点及单纯营利观点；并强调指出今后扶植生产必须根据销路，根据社会需要，对缺乏销路、没有前途的产品，不能盲目地收买。在收货时要根据不同成色规定不同价格，以提高产品的质量。同时提出，必须深入调查研究，打开生产品的销路，不能把“根据销路决定业务”作为不扶植生产、不积极找生产品销路的借口。三、贯彻了精密计划、科学管理的企业化思想。在发展生产支援战争总的方针下，加强经营管理，逐步做到企业化。会议总结了半年来稳定物价的经验，一方面要反对从主观愿望出发的盲目的机械稳定，企图在战争情况收支不平衡的情况下，把物价固定起来的想法。一方面也要反对任其涨落，放任自流，而对市场不加管制的投降思想。今后必须掌握客观规律及地区差额，根据市场情况，加上主观努力，即对市场的管理控制，作到防止物价暴涨暴落。会议根据当前任务及具体情况，拟定了九月至明年五月份的业务计划，系统的规定了会计情报及工作报告等制度。适当调整了组织，以适应工作的发展。
    在商店干部作风上，会议作了比较深刻的检查，打击了官僚主义机关化的作风，提出加强干部、改造作风学会作生意的号召。并要求干部加强理论政策学习，加强思想意识的锻炼，克服无组织无纪律状态，在工作中不断提高自己，准备担负更重大的任务。
