　　Celebrating the Harvest in Shili Village and Xigou Village
　　Shili Village in Huguan County and Xigou Village in Pingshun County, both in the Taihang District, under the leadership of the well-known labor hero and Communist Party member Xiang Tishui and the active guidance of the village branches, have not only reached their planned yields this year but have far exceeded the target of increasing fine grain production by three sheng per mu. While extending our warm congratulations on their bountiful harvest, we hope that all localities will learn from these two villages in the following two aspects:

　　First, respond to the Party's call and actively promote that land reform is for developing production and Party rectification is for strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses, so as to dispel the masses' misgivings and stimulate the enthusiasm of Party members. This spring, Xigou and Shili villages, like other areas in Taihang, on the one hand, implemented land reform, eliminated the feudal exploitation system, and enabled landless and land-poor peasants to obtain land, all of whom wanted to work hard to become rich; on the other hand, due to erroneous infringements upon some middle peasants during the land reform, many doubts arose among the peasants. In response to this, in addition to making appropriate corrections, Comrades Li Shunda and Xiang Tishui emphatically told the peasants: "The Party wants us to get rich, not poor," and they led the peasants with their own exemplary behavior, so that the peasants could cultivate the land with peace of mind without delaying the season. Their in-depth publicity of the Party's policies enabled the peasants to improve their understanding of the Party and its policies. The same is true for Party rectification: Some comrades adopted a passive attitude of "being rectified," abandoning leadership. Comrades Li and Xiang actively explained to Party members, "Party rectification is for improvement, not for overthrow; it is to enable everyone to better serve the people, not to lie down and do nothing." Lying down is wrong, and finally the erroneous understanding of the Party members was transformed from passive to active. There are still many villages that are not working hard because the above-mentioned problems have not been resolved, and this experience should be learned.

　　Second, specifically lead the masses in production. This includes two aspects: one is to have a general plan for the whole year, and more specific short-term plans for each agricultural stage, so that each stage of production has a goal; the other is to specifically arrange life and organize the implementation of these plans. These two villages applied base fertilizer during the spring plowing, and then applied a large amount of topdressing in the summer. Shili Village generally applied 80 dan of manure per mu, and Xigou Village applied 100 dan per mu. Xiang Tishui applied 130 dan per mu. Weeding seedlings was generally done two to three times. Xigou Village universally promoted the techniques of large ridge planting of millet and sowing and weeding seedlings. Rescuing seedlings and pruning leaves in the event of hail disasters, as well as fighting against river water in the autumn, were all the result of quite meticulous organizational work. In order to enable the masses to be organized to overcome various difficulties, they had seriously cleaned up the problems left over from past mutual assistance, correctly implemented the Party's policy of voluntary equivalence (such as appropriately raising wages so that all households could accept), and overcame some unreasonable and inconvenient practices in past mutual assistance (such as overemphasizing collective cultivation), and replaced them with flexible methods that the masses were willing to implement (such as doing the whole work collectively and doing odd jobs separately). In this way, the peasants who had some misunderstandings about mutual assistance last year specifically recognized the benefits of mutual assistance, universally joined the organization, and solved the difficulties of each household.

　　There are still many areas that are not good at specifically organizing mass production, so that leadership remains at the level of general appeals; or some erroneous practices are used, which make the peasants feel troubled and even oppose organizing themselves. It is necessary to seriously learn from the experience and lessons here, correct errors and shortcomings, and further develop and enrich the experience of leading production in this year's winter production and next year's large-scale production.

### 庆贺十里村、西沟丰收

　　庆贺十里村、西沟丰收
    太行区壶关县的十里村与平顺县的西沟村，在著名劳动英雄共产党员向提水李顺达的带头与村支部的积极领导推动下，今年不仅达到了应产量，而且远远超过了每亩增产三升细粮的计划。庆获丰收，我们除致以热忱的祝贺外，并希望各地从以下两方面向这两村学习。
    第一、响应党的号召，积极宣传土改是为了发展生产，整党是为了密切党与群众联系，以消除群众错觉，启发党员积极性。今年春天，西沟和十里村也象太行其他地区一样，一方面是实行了土地改革，消灭了封建剥削制度，使无地少地农民获得土地，都想努力生产致富；另方面又因土改中错误地侵犯了一些中农，致使农民发生许多疑虑。对此，除适当纠偏外，李顺达与向提水二同志肯定地告诉农民：“党是叫咱们过富，不是叫过穷”，又以自己的模范行为去带动农民，这样使农民安心耕作，没有耽误季节。他们深入的宣传党的政策，使农民也提高了对党与党的政策的认识。对整党也是如此：有些同志抱着消极的“挨整”态度，放弃领导，李、向二同志则积极的向党员解释，“整党是为了整好，不是为了整倒；是要大家更好的为人民服务，不是躺倒不干”，躺倒是错误的，终于转变了党员的错误认识，由消极转为积极。现在还有不少村庄因上述问题没有解决，干得不起劲，应吸取这个经验。
    第二、具体领导群众生产。这又包括两方面：一是全年有总计划，在各个农事段落上又有更具体的短期计划，使各段生产都有目标；一是具体地安排生活，组织这些计划的实现。这两村春耕时上了底粪，夏季又大量追肥，十里村普遍达到每亩上粪八十担，西沟达到一百担，向提水每亩达到一百三十担；锄苗，一般都达到二遍至三遍；西沟普遍推广了大垄谷和下种、锄苗的各种技术；在遭受雹灾时进行扶苗剪叶，以及秋季与河水做斗争，都是经过相当细密的组织工作的。他们为使群众能组织起来克服各种困难，曾经认真的清理了过去互助中的遗留问题，正确实行了党的自愿等价政策（如适当提高工资使各户都能接受），克服了过去互助中某些不合理不方便的做法（如过分强调集体耕作），换上了群众都乐意实行的活便办法（如整活集体做，零活分散做等）。这样使去年对互助有些误解的农民，都具体认识了互助的好处，普遍加入组织，使各户困难都得到解决。
    现在还有不少地区不善于具体组织群众生产，使领导停留在一般号召上；或用了一些错误的做法，使农民感觉麻烦，甚至反对组织起来，这就需要认真从这里吸取经验教训，改正错误与缺点，并在今年的冬季生产与明年的大生产中更加发挥与丰富领导生产的经验。
