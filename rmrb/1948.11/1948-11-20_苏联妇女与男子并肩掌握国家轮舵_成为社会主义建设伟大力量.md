　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS reports: Since the October Revolution, Soviet women have played an increasingly important role in the political, economic, and cultural life of the country, and have become a great force in socialist construction. In the second year of the October Revolution, the first All-Russian Congress of Workers' and Peasants' Women was held in Moscow, which defined the tasks of Soviet women in socialist construction. Since then, millions of workers', peasants', and intellectual women have actively participated in socialist construction. Now, on the occasion of the 31st anniversary of the October Revolution and the 30th anniversary of the first All-Russian Congress of Workers' and Peasants' Women, the Soviet people proudly see that Soviet women are already equally shouldering the helm of the country alongside men. In 1922, only 45 female representatives participated in the First Congress of Soviets. But now, 277 of the most outstanding Soviet daughters are representatives to the Supreme Soviet, and more than 1,700 are representatives to the Supreme Soviets of various Union and Autonomous Republics. The total number of women working in local Soviets is over 450,000. Before the October Revolution, there were fewer than 1,000 female judges in all of Russia, but today, 20 percent of the judges in the Soviet Supreme Court are women, and women account for 35 percent of the people's judges. In 1940, women participating in national economic construction accounted for 40 percent of the total number of people, and now this percentage has greatly increased. In fact, half of the specialized professionals in the Soviet Union are women. Fifty years ago, there were only three women among the 848 engineers in Petersburg (now Leningrad), but in 1940, Leningrad already had 24,000 female engineers. There are 4,000 female workers in the scientific institutions of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. During the war, approximately 1,500 women received doctoral and master's degrees in science. Soviet women are playing an important role in completing Stalin's post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Soviet female workers, such as Maria Volkova, a textile worker who manages many textile machines, and lathe operator Anna Kushinova, are respected throughout the Soviet Union. Soviet rural women have created many world records for crop yields.

　　苏联妇女与男子并肩掌握国家轮舵
  　成为社会主义建设伟大力量
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社讯：自十月革命以来，苏联妇女在国家的政治、经济与文化生活中，日益起着重要作用，已成为社会主义建设中的伟大力量。在十月革命的第二年，莫斯科召开了第一届全俄工农妇女大会，大会规定了苏维埃妇女在社会主义建设中的任务。其后，千百万工农妇女和知识分子妇女就积极地参加了社会主义建设。现在，当十月革命三十一周年、第一届全俄工农妇女大会三十周年的时候，苏联人民骄傲地看到：苏联妇女已经平等地和男子并肩掌握着国家的轮舵。在一九二二年的时候，参加第一届苏维埃大会的，只有四十五名女代表。但现在，却有二百七十七名最优秀的苏联女儿是最高苏维埃的代表，一千七百余名是各加盟共和国与自治共和国的最高苏维埃的代表。在各个地方苏维埃里工作的妇女，总数达四十五万以上。十月革命以前，全俄国的女法官不到一千人，但今天，苏联最高法庭中的法官有百分之二十是妇女，人民法官中妇女占百分之三十五。一九四零年参加国家经济建设的妇女，占总人数的百分之四十，现在，这一百分比又有很大的增加。实际上，苏联专门职业者有半数是妇女。五十年以前，彼得堡（按即现在的列宁格勒）的八百四十八个工程师中只有三个妇女，但在一九四零年，列宁格勒已径有二万四千个女工程师。苏联科学院各科学机构中，有四千个女工作者。在战时，约有一千五百名妇女受科学博士与科学硕士的学位。在提早完成斯大林战后五年计划中，苏维埃妇女起着重要的作用。苏联女工，如管理许多纺织机的纺织工人玛丽亚·伏尔科娃，和车工安娜·库希诺娃等，在全苏联都受到尊敬。苏联的农村妇女，已创造了许多农作物收获量的世界纪录。
