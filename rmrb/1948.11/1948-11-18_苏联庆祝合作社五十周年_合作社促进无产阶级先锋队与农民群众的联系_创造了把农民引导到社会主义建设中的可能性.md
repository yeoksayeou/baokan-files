Xinhua News Agency, North Shaanxi, 15th: TASS reports: The Soviet people celebrated the 50th anniversary of the establishment of cooperatives on the 11th.

　　The Moscow Union of Consumer Cooperatives was founded on November 11, 1898. At that time, the union had only 18 member consumer cooperatives. Under the rule of the Tsar, the development of consumer cooperatives was very slow. Until 1917, it only absorbed six million members and opened 16,000 small shops.

　　The great October Socialist Revolution opened up broad avenues for the large-scale development of consumer cooperatives. Before the Patriotic War, the turnover of consumer cooperatives accounted for 26 percent of urban trade and 86 percent of rural trade. Now, the Central Union of Cooperatives of the Soviet Union has 28,000 cooperatives with more than 32 million members. Retail trade by consumer cooperatives accounts for more than 50 percent of the total retail trade in the Soviet Union. In the second half of 1947, in preparation for the abolition of rationing, consumer cooperatives greatly expanded the trade organization network, as dense as a spider web, in urban and rural areas, and the number of shops increased to nearly 200,000. In 1947, the trade volume of cooperative retail goods reached 70.4 billion rubles (including 24.4 billion rubles of urban trade), which was double that of 1945. This year, cooperatives have added another 20,000 shops, and the total trade volume has greatly exceeded that of last year. Cooperatives have also played a major role in the country's storage work. This year, cooperatives supplied more than 40 percent of the country's total potato storage, 37 percent of vegetables, and 70 percent of eggs. In terms of prices, since January of this year, food prices in cooperative stores have been reduced by 25 to 30 percent. This autumn, potato prices are two-thirds cheaper than last autumn, and meat and oil are half cheaper.

　　Cooperatives have also played a major role in production. According to the Management Office of the Central Production Cooperatives of the Soviet Union, the cooperatives of the Russian Federation alone united more than 30,000 enterprises and factories manufacturing various items. The production volume of the Russian Federation Production Cooperatives in the first nine months of this year increased by 20 percent compared with the same period last year, and 75 percent of the production was consumer goods. Since the war, cooperatives have spent more than 250 million rubles each year to expand and establish new factories. This year, nearly 1,000 new factories have already started operation.

　　Xinhua News Agency, North Shaanxi, 15th: TASS reports: The Pravda recently published an editorial celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives. The editorial writes: Stalin taught that when the dictatorship of the proletariat has been consolidated, cooperatives have special significance in the period of large-scale construction. It promotes the connection between the proletarian vanguard and the peasant masses, and creates the possibility of guiding the peasants into socialist construction. The Lenin cooperative plan, which includes all forms of agricultural cooperatives—from the lower stages (supply and sales) to the higher stages (production and collective farming)—has pointed out the broad road for the socialist development of the Soviet countryside. The strong development of cooperatives, especially agricultural cooperatives, has provided a psychological foundation among the peasants for approving collective farms. The greatest revolutionary change—the collectivization of the countryside and the victory of the collective farming system—is the true victory of the Lenin cooperative plan developed and supplemented under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and Stalin. After the complete victory of the collective farming system, the task of consumer cooperatives is to help collective farms further consolidate from an organizational and economic point of view, improve the cultural level of collective farmers, and increase the welfare of the working people.

　　The editorial pointed out that cooperatives provide an important channel for the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. The task of Soviet cooperative personnel is to improve rural trade in every possible way, purchase the surplus produce of farmers on a large scale, and at the same time, develop sales agencies for agricultural products as widely as possible in cities, towns, and workers' residential areas. Since the currency reform and the abolition of rationing, the purchasing power of the Soviet ruble has doubled. In this regard, the price reduction of cooperative trade and the reduction of state retail prices play an equally important role. In the future, Soviet cooperative personnel will achieve further victories in the struggle for a new upsurge in the Soviet economy and culture.

　　苏联庆祝合作社五十周年
    合作社促进无产阶级先锋队与农民群众的联系
    创造了把农民引导到社会主义建设中的可能性
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社讯：苏联人民于十一日庆祝合作社成立五十周年纪念。
    莫斯科消费合作社联合会成立于一八九八年十一月十一日，当时，联合会会员仅有十八个消费合作社。在沙皇的统治下，消费合作社的发展很缓慢，直到一九一七年止，只吸收了六百万社员，开设了一万六千家小商店。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命，给消费合作社的大规模发展开辟了广阔的道路。爱国战争前，消费合作社的贸易额，即占城市贸易的百分之二十六，占乡村贸易的百分之八十六。现在，苏联合作社中央联合会有合作社二万八千所，拥有三千二百余万会员。消费合作社的零售贸易，已占苏联全部零售贸易总额的百分之五十以上。一九四七年下半年准备取消配给时，消费合作社大大扩展了城乡中密如蛛网的贸易机构网，商店的数目增加到将近二十万家。一九四七年全年，合作社零售货物的贸易额达七百零四亿卢布（其中城市贸易额达二百四十四亿卢布），比一九四五年增加一倍。今年，合作社又增加了商店两万家，贸易总额又大大超过去年。合作社对国家的存储工作也起了很大作用，今年在国家的存储总量中，合作社供给的洋芋占百分之四十以上，蔬菜占百分之三十七，鸡蛋占百分之七十。物价方面，从今年一月以来，合作商店的粮食价格已减低了百分之二十五至三十。今年秋季，洋芋价格比去年秋季便宜三分之二，肉类和油类便宜一半。
    合作社在生产中间也起了很大的作用。据苏联中央生产合作社管理处宣称：仅俄罗斯联邦合作社，即团结了制造各种物品的企业及制造厂三万余家。俄罗斯联邦生产合作社今年头九个月的生产量，比去年同一时期增加百分之二十，生产的百分之七十五为消费品。自战争以来，合作社每年花费二亿五千余万卢布，用以扩充并建立新的制造厂。今年，将近有一千家新工厂与制造厂已经开工。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社讯：真理报顷发表社论，庆祝消费合作社中央联合会五十周年纪念。社论写道：斯大林教导说：当无产阶级专政已告巩固时，合作社在大规模建设的时期中，有特别的重大意义。它促进无产阶级先锋队与农民群众的联系，并创造了把农民引导到社会主义建设中来的可能性。包含有农业合作社之一切形式——从较低阶段（供给与销售）到较高阶段（生产与集体耕作）——的列宁合作社计划，已经指明了苏联农村社会主义发展的康庄大道。合作社、特别是农业合作社的强大发展，已经在农民中提供了赞同集体农场的心理基础。最伟大的革命性的改变——农村集体化、集体耕作制度的胜利，乃是在布尔什维克党及斯大林领导下所发展与补充了的列宁合作社计划的真正胜利。集体耕作制度完全胜利之后，消费合作社的任务，就是从组织与经济的观点上，帮助集体农场作进一步的巩固，提高集体农民的文化水平，并增进劳动人民的福利。
    社论指出，合作社给城乡之间的货物交换，提供了一个重要的途径。苏维埃合作社人员的任务，就是以各种可能的方法，改进农村的贸易，大规模购买农民的剩余生产品，并同时在城市、市镇及工人住宅区，尽量广泛地发展销售农产品的贸易机关。自从货币改革、取消配给以后，苏联卢布的购买力已增加两倍。在这方面，合作社贸易的减价，和国家零售价格的减低，同样起着重大的作用。今后，苏维埃合作社人员在争取苏联经济与文化之新高涨的斗争中，将取得进一步的胜利。
