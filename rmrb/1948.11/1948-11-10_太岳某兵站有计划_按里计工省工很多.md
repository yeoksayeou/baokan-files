　　Taiyue Telegram: A Certain Supply Station in Taiyue Has a Plan
  　Calculating Work by Distance Saves a Lot of Labor
    [Taiyue Electric] A certain supply station in Taiyue, when using civilian laborers, adopted the method of calculating work by distance and providing rewards, saving one-third of the originally planned manpower and increasing transportation speed. Secondly, 830 carts from Qin County and Tunliu County were used to transport supplies to the front lines. The supply station implemented a method of calculating diligent work by distance and rewarding extra loads. As a result, the tasks that were expected to take ten days for ox carts and eight days for mule and donkey carts were mostly completed in five and a half days, and the rest took a maximum of only eight days. A total of 1,869.5 man-days and 1,828.5 animal-days were saved. Rewards were given for exceeding the specified load weight. Previously, each cart averaged six pieces; now they carry seven. Carts that used to average seven and a half boxes now carry eight and a half, saving a total of 1,340 man-days and animal-days. This fact shows that in support of the front line, work must be recorded and points assigned to stimulate the enthusiasm of the civilian laborers and save manpower. At the same time, the supply station should have a plan and be prepared, making specific plans for the number of pieces, weight, and required labor and vehicles of all goods in advance. As soon as the carts arrive, the load-bearing capacity is divided into grades according to the specific conditions of the ox, mule, and donkey carts, and the weight of the goods to be loaded is determined. Load and go as soon as they arrive; those who arrive first do not have to wait, and those who arrive late do not have to stop, greatly increasing transportation speed.

　　太岳某兵站有计划
  　按里计工省工很多
    【太岳电】太岳某兵站，在使用民工上，采用按里计工与奖励办法，节省了原订计划三分之一的民力，又增加了运输速度。其次，沁县、屯留两县大车八百三十辆转运支前，该兵站实按里计勤工与奖励多载的办法，结果牛车十天的任务、骡马驴车八天的任务大部五天半完成，其余最多也只用了八天。共节省民工一千八百六十九个半，畜力一千八百二十八个半。凡超过规定载重量的给予奖励，从前每车平均拉六件，现在拉七件。过去每车平均拉七箱半的，现在拉八箱半，又节省了人力畜力共一千三百四十个。这一事实说明在支前勤务上，一定要记工记分，才能发挥民工的积极性，并能节省民力。同时兵站应有计划，有准备，事先把所有货物的件数、重量及需用的人工车辆作出具体计划，车子一来，即根据牛骡马车的具体条件，划分负重等级，确定载货重量；随到随载，随装随走，先到的不用等，迟到的也不用停，大大增加了运输速度。
