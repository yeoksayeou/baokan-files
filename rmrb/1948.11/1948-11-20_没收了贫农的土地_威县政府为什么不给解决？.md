　　Confiscated the Land of the Poor Peasants
　　Why Doesn't the Wei County Government Resolve It?
　　Editor:
　　I am a poor peasant from South Street in Wei County, Jinnan. I have a matter to request and ask you to forward it to the local government for investigation and resolution.
　　In the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), when the enemy occupied Wei County, because my two sons were participating in the anti-Japanese work (one is now in the Northwest People's Liberation Army, and one is teaching at Nangong Yang Middle School), the whole family, old and young, were afraid of persecution by the enemy and fled to Nanli Village in the second district of the county. At that time, we didn't have an acre of land and relied on pushing a small grocery cart and government preferential treatment grain to maintain our lives. The whole family saved every penny and bought fifteen and a half acres of land in the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943). When Nanli Village organized a farmers' association, I joined it. Last year, during the land reform, the farmers' association decided to distribute forty acres of land to me. Because I had no labor at home, I only kept fifteen acres. I was also given two chairs, a drawer table, a flat cabinet, a stool, a rake, a plot of land, a sieve, and a seed drill. Last winter, the whole family wanted to return to our old home. We discussed it with all the village cadres and the masses, and decided to return the fifteen acres of land and the rake and iron sieve among the additional properties to the farmers' association, and take all the remaining additional properties with us. When we moved, the village office also wrote a certificate (which I still have), and the cadres and the masses saw us off outside the village very amicably.
　　This year in May, my whole family went to Nanli Village to harvest my fifteen acres of wheat. After threshing the wheat, we borrowed a cart to transport it to the city. At this time, two newly replaced village cadres, Zhen Xiang and Li Wenkui, came. They said to me, "You have to return the fruits you were given in the past, otherwise, you won't be allowed to take your wheat away." At that time, I didn't understand this matter, so I went to ask the work team leader Yang Jingmin. Team leader Yang said, "If the masses want you to return it, what can you do?" I said, "I didn't get a second share in the city, I only got sixteen rooms (with a certificate from the village farmers' association). The additional properties I was given in Nanli Village were all taken away with the consent of the masses of the whole village, and they even wrote a certificate." Team leader Yang said, "That was arranged by the Party school cadres." I said, "Didn't Chairman Mao say that all the poor people in the world are one family?" Team leader Yang said, "You moved to the city, are you still one family?" Finally, he said, "I don't care, go ask the masses!" I went to find the village cadres again, and the village cadres said, "Go ask Team leader Yang!" Both sides kept pushing each other, and it was not resolved for several days, and the wheat was still being held and not allowed to be taken away. Under this kind of situation, I was forced to return the fruits. After the wheat harvest, it rained, and I went to plant the land again. When I got to the field, I saw that others were already sowing the land. Later, I asked and found out that the land had also been confiscated.
　　The land was bought with my own savings, and taking away the additional properties was agreed by all the village cadres and masses, and they even wrote a certificate. Besides, I didn't get a second share in the city, so why was my wheat held back and I was forced to return the fruits? My whole family of twelve people, with a total of fifteen and a half acres of land, why was it all confiscated? The Land Law Outline clearly states: "Confiscate the land of the landlords, requisition the surplus land of the rich peasants, and do not touch the land of the middle peasants." Why was the land of the peasants also confiscated? I have consulted the county and district governments on this matter, and Comrade Gao, the secretary of our district committee, also wrote a letter to the county explaining this matter, but it has been more than half a year and there has been no reply or resolution. Aren't the county and district governments working for the people? Why don't they care? I think the People's Daily listens to the opinions of the masses. I request that it be published in the newspaper and find a way to resolve it for me. If there is anything untrue, I will be fully responsible.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Gao Lüshi from Gao Family, South Street, Wei County

　　(Editor's note: According to the letters from Gao Lüshi of Wei County and Liu Wenxiu of Wei County, both families are poor peasants. One had their land confiscated and were forced to return additional properties, and their appeal to the government has not been resolved for half a year. The other was arbitrarily tied up and detained without asking about the circumstances, and has not been dealt with for two months. If the above situation is true, the attitude of Team Leader Yang Jingmin of Nanli Village, Wei County, of allowing and condoning the infringement of the interests of poor peasants, and the extremely bad style of the workers of Nanliugang Village, Wei County, of arbitrarily tying people up, should be strictly criticized. At the same time, Liu Xiaozhang has been detained for two months, and Gao Lüshi's appeal has not been dealt with for half a year. The county and district governments of the two counties have ignored them and failed to deal with them, which is also an irresponsible bureaucratic style. It is hoped that the responsible parties in the two counties will promptly check and deal with the matter after seeing the report, and publish the results of the handling in the newspaper. Currently, in some places, when arranging resettlement and compensation, they forcibly dig out the fruits that the poor and hired peasants have just obtained without any principle, and compensate all the households that have been struggled against indiscriminately. They are not concerned about the infringement of the legitimate interests of the poor and hired peasants and the impact on their emotions. This is a right-leaning deviation and a wrong manifestation, which should be paid attention to by all localities.)

### 没收了贫农的土地　威县政府为什么不给解决？

　　没收了贫农的土地
  　威县政府为什么不给解决？编辑同志：
    我是一个贫农，冀南威县城里南街人。有一件事情请求，并请转告当地政府调查解决。
    民国二十七年，敌人占据威县城时，我因有两个儿子参加抗日工作（一个现在西北人民解放军，一个现在南宫阳中学教书），全家老幼因怕敌人迫害，都逃到本县二区南里村居住。当时一亩地也没有，依靠推小杂货车，及政府优抗粮来维持生活。全家省吃俭用，于民国三十二年买了十五亩半地。南里村组织农会时，我便参加了农会。去年土改时农会决议分给了我土地四十亩，我因家中无劳动力只留了十五亩。分浮了两把椅子，一个抽屉桌，一座平柜，一个凳，一个耙，一个地。一个筛子，一个耧，去年冬，全家都愿意回老家住，和全村干部群众都商量好，除将分的十五亩地及浮财中的耙、铁筛子等三件农具退交农会外，其余浮财全部带走。搬家时，村公所还给写了证明信（现在还存着），干部及群众送到村外，都很和气。
    今年五月，我全家都去南里村割我自己那十五亩麦子，打下麦子后，便借车往城里运，这时来了两个新换的村干，贞祥和李文奎。他俩对我说：“过去你分的果实，都要退回来，不然你的麦子不让你拉走”。当时我对这件事情不明白，就去问工作组杨敬民组长，杨组长说：“群众要叫你退，那有什么办法呢？”我说：“俺在城里又没有分第二份，只是分了十六间房子（有村里农会的证明信），在南里村分的浮财是全村群众叫俺带走的，还给写了证明信”。杨组长说：“那是党校干部包办的”。我说：“毛主席不是说天下贫民是一家吗？”杨组长说：“你搬到城里去，还是一家吗？”最后他说：“我不管，你去问群众吧！”我又去找村干，村干就说：“找杨组长吧！”双方互相推脱，好几天没有解决，仍是扣着麦子不让拉走。在这种情况下，就逼着将果实退回去了。麦后下了雨，我又去种地，走到地里一看，别人正在耩地，后来一问才知道地也没收了。
    土地是我自己省吃俭用买下的，带走浮财是全村村干群众同意的，还给写了证明信，并且我在城里又没有分第二份，为什么扣住我的麦子，逼着退果实呢？我全家十二口人，共地十五亩半，为啥都给没收了呢？土地法大纲上写的明白：“没收地主的土地，征收富农多余的土地，中农土地不动。”为啥农民的土地也没收了呢？这个问题，曾经请示过县区政府，同时，我区委书记高同志也曾给县里写过信说明这个事情，但至今半年多了，始终没有得到答复与解决，县区政府不是为人民办事的吗？他们为什么不管呢？我想人民日报是听取群众意见的，请求在报上公布，并设法给我解决为盼，如有不实，我负完全责任。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　威县南街高家高吕氏
    （编者按：根据威县高吕氏，魏县刘文秀两人的来信，家庭成份都是贫农。一个被没收了土地，逼退了浮财，向政府申诉半年未见解决；一个被不问情由，捆绑扣押，至今两月未得处理。上述情况，如若属实，象威县南里村杨敬民组长那样对侵犯贫农利益采取放任纵容的态度，与魏县南刘岗村工作员那种随便捆人的极端恶劣的作风，都应受到严格批评，同时，刘孝章被押二月，高吕氏申诉半年，两县县区政府，不加理睬，不予处理，也是不负责任的官僚主义作风。希望两县负责方面见报后，迅速检查处理，并将处理结果在报纸公布。现在有些地方，在安置补赏时，毫无立场地、强迫命令地硬从贫雇农手中挖出刚刚得到的果实，不加区别地补赏给一切被斗户；对贫雇农应得利益被侵犯，情绪被打击，毫不关心，这是右的偏向和错误的表现，应引起各地注意。）
