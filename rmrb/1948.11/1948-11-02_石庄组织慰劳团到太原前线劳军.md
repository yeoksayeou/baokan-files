    [Shijiazhuang News] As the People's Liberation Army is fiercely attacking Taiyuan, four groups, including the Shijiazhuang Workers' Union, Youth League, Women's Federation, and Federation of Industry and Commerce, launched a campaign on the 20th of this month to support the army and organized a frontline慰劳团 to encourage and support all the soldiers to liberate the last isolated city in central Shanxi as soon as possible. After the announcement was published in the newspaper, the workers in the factories responded first, followed by dozens of representatives from the city's business community who launched fundraising campaigns. The cinemas held charity performances, and the municipal government's agencies, colleges, and primary and secondary school students sewed慰问袋, made錦旗, and wrote慰劳信. In four days, they received more than 5,000慰问信, 12.7 million Jiao of Hebei currency, 271 dozen towels, 50 boxes of soap, more than 100 cartons of cigarettes, 9錦旗, 772 notebooks, 56 dozen pencils, 480 bottles of various wines, and more than 1,000 various慰问袋. In addition, there were dozens of kinds of items such as toothpaste, sweaters, watches, books, etc., packed into boxes, totaling 95 pieces of various sizes. The排子车 union responded to the support for the front and sent eight workers and four vehicles to assist in loading and transporting. The慰劳团 departed on the afternoon of the 24th, with a total of thirteen participating agencies and groups, led by Comrade Li Bin, a "February 7th" worker. Before departing, they told reporters: "We are determined to bring the greatest efforts to convey the enthusiasm of the party, government, military leaders, and the citizens of the city to the front, and we will certainly enter the city soon to comfort all the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army."
