Tokyo dispatch: 35,000 Japanese government employees held protest demonstrations on the 18th, defying the reactionary government's ban, opposing the Yoshida Cabinet and the proposed anti-strike legislation. The 24-hour continuous strike by workers from the Kyushu, Honshu, and Hokkaido coal miners unions has entered its seventh day, with 60,000 strikers on the 16th. Hokkaido coal miners have even created a new tactic of "strike without tools," going to work without bringing any tools. The coal miners' union headquarters announced that it would persist with this short, continuous strike until its goals are achieved. According to TASS, citing statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Labor, there were 244 strikes in Japan this year, 140 of which occurred in August.

　　日矿工连续罢工
  　八月份罢工事件达百四十次
    【新华社陕北十九日电】东京讯：日本矿工正在进行全国性和连续性的二十四小时罢工斗争。煤矿工会工人于十日开始八万人罢工后，迄十五日止，每日均有二万至九万人罢工；十三日罢工者四万人，十五日罢工者五万人。继煤矿工会工人之后，铁矿、铜矿及其他金属矿工七万五千人，亦于十五日开始全国性的二十四小时罢工。煤矿与金属矿工两工会于十五日发表联合声明，要求吉田内阁辞职，立即解散国会，提高工资至每月一万二千日元以及改善矿内安全设备。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】东京讯：日本政府机关职工三万五千人，于十八日蔑视反动政府禁令，举行抗议性示威，反对吉田内阁及拟议中的反罢工立法。九州、本州、北海道三大煤矿工会工人二十四小时的连续性罢工斗争已进入第七日，十六日罢工者六万人。北海道煤矿工人更创造了“无工具罢工”的新策略，上工时不带任何工具。煤矿工会总部宣布：将坚持这种短促的连续性罢工，直到达到目标为止。据塔斯社引日本劳工省统计，今年日本发生了二百四十四次罢工，其中一百四十次在八月份。这些罢工主要原因为工资问题。
