　　Treatment and Prevention of Swine Fever
　　——Reply to Comrade Wang Fengxiang of the North China Party School
　　1. If a pig develops a cyan-edged, red star-shaped bruise the size of a melon seed at the corner of its eye, refuses to eat, has a dry nasal cavity, and has dull eyes, and dies within about three to four days, the condition is likely simple swine fever. Treatment: In the early stages of the disease, subcutaneous or intravenous injection of swine fever serum is effective. Dosage: small pigs 10CC-20CC, medium pigs 20CC-50CC, large pigs 50CC-100CC. Secondly, disinfectants such as salol 2-8.GM taken internally, mercuric chloride 0.01-0.02GM injected subcutaneously, or soapy water enemas can be tried, but the effect is not certain. In addition, attention should be paid to feed, cleanliness of the pigsty and air circulation.
　　2. If a pig's abdomen is swollen, it refuses to eat, has dry nostrils, and dies after five or six days, it may be suffering from constipation and colic. Treatment: First, administer an enema with soapy water and apply stimulating liniments such as turpentine oil to the abdomen. If the pig groans in pain, morphine 0.1-0.3 can be injected subcutaneously. A purgative such as calomel 3-4.GM can be used. Secondly, stepping back and forth on the pig's belly with a human foot can also be tried, and is often effective.
　　3. If a pig develops almond-sized lumps all over its body, the hair falls out in those areas, and the skin is white-red spotted, it refuses to eat, and dies within a few days, it may be swine erysipelas, a septicemic form of erysipelas. Treatment: Anti-swine erysipelas serum 20CC-50CC can be injected subcutaneously. For pigs with larger body weights, the dosage can be increased to 80CC. After the injection, another injection should be given after seven or eight hours, until the body temperature drops. Secondly, Prontosil is also effective, the dosage being 1.GM three times on the first day. After the second day, the dosage can be reduced appropriately. Also, in the early stages of the disease, calomel 0.2-0.4GM can be taken internally, or a 5% aqueous solution of creolin (lysol) can be given three times a day, one tablespoon each time, which is also effective.

　　Prevention Methods

　　Swine fever and swine erysipelas are both infectious diseases. The best way for us to deal with them is prevention. Prevention methods are as follows:

　　1. When a pig is found to be ill, the village government should be notified immediately so that prevention measures can be communicated to prevent the spread of the disease.

　　2. Healthy pigs should be separated from sick pigs.

　　3. Disinfection should be carried out. After the sick pig is removed, use physical methods or chemical drugs such as lime to disinfect. The utensils used and the people who have come into contact with the sick pig must also be disinfected.

　　4. Preventive injections, such as injections of swine fever or swine erysipelas serum vaccines, etc.

　　5. The feces and carcasses of sick pigs should be burned or buried deep underground. During epidemic periods, suspicious sick pigs should not be purchased. (Veterinary Group, North China Medical University)

　　猪瘟的治疗和预防法
    ——答华北党校王凤祥同志
    一、猪的眼角生了一个瓜子大小青边红星形的瘀肉，不吃食物，鼻腔发干，眼睛迟钝，约经三四天内即死亡。照这样看来，其病症可能是属于单纯性猪瘟。治疗的办法：当病发的初期应用猪瘟血清皮下或静脉内注射有效，用量：小猪１０ＣＣ—２０ＣＣ，中猪２０ＣＣ—５０ＣＣ，大猪５０ＣＣ—１００ＣＣ；其次用消毒剂如萨罗儿２—８．ＧＭ内服，升汞０．０１—０．０２ＧＭ皮下注射或肥皂水灌肠等皆可试用，唯效果不确实。此外宜注意饲料，猪舍清洁及流通空气等。
    二、猪的肚子发胀，不吃东西，鼻孔干燥，经过五、六天即死，这可能是属于猪便秘疝痛。其治疗的办法：先用肥皂水施行灌肠，腹部涂松节油等刺戟性擦剂。如疼痛呻吟时，可皮下注射吗啡０．１—０．３。下剂可用甘汞３—４．ＧＭ。其次用人足在猪肚子上来回蹬，亦可试用，往往有效。
    三、猪的全身生一种杏核大小的疙＠，该部皮肤的毛退掉，呈白红色斑，不吃东西，数日内死亡。这可能是猪丹毒，属于败血型之一种的丹毒。其治疗的办法：可皮下注射抗猪丹毒血清２０ＣＣ—５０ＣＣ。体重大的可增量至８０ＣＣ。注射之后，经过七、八小时再行注射，至体温下降时为止。其次用百浪多息亦有效，用量在第一日给三次，每次１．ＧＭ。第二日以后，可酌量减少。又病初时可应用甘汞０．２—０．４ＧＭ内服，或臭药水（苦列奥林）百分之五之水溶液每日三回，每回一食匙，灌下亦有效果。
    预防法
    猪瘟与猪丹毒都是一种传染病，咱们最好的办法，就是预防。预防办法如下：
    一、患猪发觉有病时，应速即报告村政府知道，以便传达预防，以免蔓延。
    二、健康的猪与患病的猪应隔离开。
    三、施行消毒。将患猪离开后，用理学的方法或化学的药物如石灰等消毒，所用之器具及接触病猪的人都要消毒。
    四、预防注射。如注射猪瘟或猪丹毒血清疫苗等。
    五、患猪的粪便及尸体施行焚烧或深埋于地下。在流行期中，有可疑的病猪不可购买。（华北医大兽医组）
