　　Self-Criticism Regarding the Report "The Entire Region's People Unite and Struggle, Overcoming Various Disasters"
Since its inception, this newspaper has reported on the glorious achievements of the People's Liberation Army's heroic struggle, inspiring the people of North China with confidence in victory. Following Chairman Mao's call to "increase production by an inch" and the instructions of the CCP Central Committee's North China Bureau to restore and develop production, it has reported on the great efforts of the people of North China to restore and develop production, as well as various related inventions and innovations, encouraging the masses' enthusiasm for production. It has reported on the situation of the people of North China vigorously supporting the front lines, on various construction efforts in politics, economy, culture, education, and democratic governance, and recently, it has continuously reported on the struggle of the people of North China to produce and provide disaster relief, criticizing the erroneous tendency to underestimate the achievements of land reform and party rectification. All of this is correct and necessary and should continue to be implemented. However, the report "The Entire Region's People Unite and Struggle, Overcoming Various Disasters," published on the first page of this newspaper on October 10th, violated the above reporting guidelines and committed a principled error.

　　Although this report is titled "The Entire Region's People Unite and Struggle, Overcoming Various Disasters," its content only shows a grim picture of disasters, without seeing how the people of the entire region united and struggled, or under what forces they were united and struggled to overcome these disasters. In fact, it is not that the people do not have the strength to overcome disasters. On the contrary, encouraged by the victory of the People's Liberation Army and supported by the victory of land reform, the people have sufficient strength to overcome disasters. In fact, it is not that the people have not yet overcome these disasters. On the contrary, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the vast number of Party, government, military, and civilian cadres, the people have already overcome the famine and achieved a harvest even better than last year's. The average harvest for the entire region is 70% of normal, and some areas have reached pre-war (pre-War of Resistance) levels, with individual areas exceeding pre-war levels. This achievement is great. These disasters, if they had occurred before the War of Resistance under the rule of the Kuomintang, would have been irreparable, and they are also irreparable in the Kuomintang-controlled areas today. So, where exactly does the problem lie? The problem lies in the minds of us reporters, who have not seen the great achievements of the North China liberated area in overcoming various disasters this year, and have not absorbed good experiences from here to encourage cadres and the people to continue their efforts on the production front. This report emphasizes not the positive aspects of overcoming disasters, but the negative aspects of heavy disasters. This can only lead readers to be crestfallen and lose confidence in the face of disasters that can be completely overcome and have already been overcome.

　　This report attributes the causes of various disasters to "protracted war" and "overly left-leaning policies in land reform." This report clearly does not distinguish between the evil and darkness caused by the Japanese invaders' aggression and the reactionary and counter-revolutionary war of plunder waged by the US-Chiang reactionaries, and the bright future created by the Chinese people's heroic and just war to save the nation from peril. Instead, it is generally shrouded in the anti-war sentiments of backward peasants and the petty bourgeoisie, viewing all wars as a source of all evil. It does not distinguish between the great historical task accomplished by the land reform movement, which liberated the vast number of peasants from the shackles of the feudal exploitation system, thereby greatly increasing the productive forces of the people's economy, and the certain left-leaning deviations that occurred during the land reform movement, which were serious but immediately corrected. It does not recognize that the relative peace we have in North China today, and our ability to carry out production and various construction projects in the context of a nationwide war, is precisely due to the victories of the People's Liberation Army on various battlefields. Without the victory of the People's Liberation Army, nothing could be discussed. Correcting left-leaning deviations in land reform is necessary. If this step is not taken, it will be impossible to demand rural stability and unity for production. But if one does not see the great achievements of land reform, and only dwells on certain left-leaning deviations that occurred during the land reform movement, as if land reform were superfluous, and does not link production and disaster relief with the great achievements of land reform, that is also wrong. Therefore, one will not realize that, as a result of the unity and heroic struggle of the Party, government, army, and people of North China to overcome severe disasters, we have finally achieved a 70% harvest. This means that we have achieved significant success on the production and disaster relief front. This achievement should first and foremost be attributed to the victory of the People's Liberation War and to the completion of land reform. Isn't this clear enough, and does it need any further proof? Comparing the severe droughts and locust plagues in the North China liberated area in 1942 and 1943 with the disasters this year, the advantageous situation today and the magnificent subjective strength to overcome disasters are beyond reason. It is true that the mobilization of manpower and materials for the protracted war has inevitably placed a great burden on the people. During land reform, in a certain period of time, "left-leaning" deviations that once occurred in some specific policies have also inevitably caused some damage to the people's production undertakings. However, inspired by the great goal of the People's Liberation Army's heroic struggle to win the liberation of the people of the whole country, and under the clean political appeal of opposing waste, practicing thrift, and implementing fair and reasonable burdens in our rear, the people have a very high level of awareness. They are willing to accept the burden of war without complaint. And the "left-leaning" deviations that once occurred during land reform were only temporary counter-current phenomena, not the mainstream, not fundamental phenomena, and were soon seriously corrected. The main and fundamental fact is that the completion of the historical task of land reform has opened up a broad road for the people of North China to develop production and build. Our task is to educate and encourage the broad masses to overcome temporary difficulties and move forward for permanent interests and final victory. Just imagine what the tragic fate of the Chinese people would be like without the People's Liberation War and land reform? Could they escape the darkness, oppression, hunger, and death? Would it be slightly better than this situation? The lives of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas today are a ready-made specimen, and the people there are eagerly looking forward to the light of new life that the People's Liberation War and land reform can bring them. It is from this perspective that we need to publicize the war and land reform.

　　So, what lessons should we draw from this report?

　　First, we should overcome the tendency of objectivism in propaganda work. The characteristic of objectivism is that it likes to list a large number of unrelated phenomena, prostrates itself before spontaneity, and often sings the praises of the feelings of backward peasants and the petty bourgeoisie. They cannot see through the surface of phenomena to find the essential internal connections, and therefore they lack active and dynamic power, and can only sit beside the mainstream and chew on and carp at the counter-current waves, succumbing to objective difficulties without the courage and strength to overcome them. In a word, it is to ignore the leading role of the proletarian vanguard in the revolutionary movement. Objectivists have no Party spirit. They do not educate the Party and the masses with the spirit of integrating the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, that is, the spirit of Mao Zedong Thought, but instead use the decadent atmosphere of the petty bourgeoisie to demoralize the Party and the masses. In terms of methodology, it is one-sidedness. The tendency of objectivism is not only seriously manifested in the report "The Entire Region's People Unite and Struggle, Overcoming Various Disasters," but also more or less in some other news items in our newspaper. Some news items are just dry and tasteless lists of many facts, without thought, without analysis, without purpose. Recently, many criticisms in the newspaper have been good and beneficial, but some criticisms often only involve negative accusations, without focusing on analyzing the causes of errors and the conditions under which they arise, and actively pointing out methods for correction and progress. Active encouragement and guidance should be the spirit that we must have in our propaganda work and in all criticism and self-criticism. Ignoring active encouragement and guidance is an unacceptable and harmful tendency of objectivism.

　　The main reason why we have the above-mentioned or similar shortcomings and errors in our reporting and work is that our theoretical level is not high. Therefore, we sometimes unconsciously lower the Party newspaper to the ideological level of the unawakened masses, and cannot give full play to the guiding role that the Party newspaper should have. After the lesson of this error, we will strive to strengthen our theoretical study and the study of policy viewpoints and strategic viewpoints, and improve our Party newspaper.

### 对“全区人民团结斗争，战胜各种灾害”报导的检讨

　　对“全区人民团结斗争，战胜各种灾害”报导的检讨
    本报创刊以来，报导了人民解放军英勇奋斗的辉煌战果，鼓舞了华北人民的胜利信心；本着毛主席“生产长一寸”的号召，及中共中央华北局恢复与发展生产的指示，报导了华北人民为了恢复与发展生产的巨大努力以及各种有关生产的创造发明，鼓励了群众的生产热情；报导了华北人民大力支援前线的情形，报导了政治、经济、文化教育、民主建政等各种建设工作，最近以来并不断地报导了华北人民生产救灾的斗争情形，批评了对土改整党成绩估计不足的错误偏向，这都是正确的必需的，仍应继续贯彻。但是十月十日本报第一版所发表的“全区人民团结斗争，战胜各种灾害”的报导，却违反了以上报导方针，犯了带有原则性的错误。
    这篇报导，虽然题为“全区人民团结斗争，战胜各种灾害”，而内容却只看到一幅阴森森的灾害图，并未看到全区人民如何团结斗争，在什么力量支持下使他们团结斗争，战胜这些灾害。事实上，并不是人民没有力量战胜灾害，恰恰相反，在人民解放军胜利的鼓舞下，在土改胜利的支持下，人民是有足够力量可以战胜灾害。事实上也不是人民还没有战胜这些灾害，恰恰相反，人民已经在共产党，在广大党政军民干部领导下，已经战胜了灾荒，获得了甚至优于去年的收成，全区平均年景为七成，有些地方已经达到战前（抗战以前）水平，个别地区超过了战前水平。这一成绩是伟大的。这些灾害，如果发生在抗战以前国民党统治时代，则曾是无可救药的，发生在现在国民党统治区，也是无可救药的。那末，问题究竟发生在什么地方呢？问题发生在我们这些报导工作者的头脑中，没有看见华北解放区今年战胜各种灾害的巨大成绩，没有从这里吸收好的经验，以鼓舞干部和人民在生产战线上继续努力。这篇报导强调的不是战胜灾害的积极方面，而是灾害重重的消极方面。这只能引导读者在完全可以克服而且已经克服的灾难面前垂头丧气，失掉信心。
    这篇报导把各种灾害的原因均归咎于“长期战争”与“土改中政策过左”。这篇报导显然没有把日寇的侵略和美蒋反动派所进行的非正义的掠夺的反动的反革命战争所造成的罪恶和黑暗的一方面与中国人民所英勇进行的正义的挽救国家民族于危亡之中的进步的革命战争所造成的光明前途的一方面加以区别，而是笼统地为落后农民和小资产阶级反战情绪所笼罩，不分什么战争，都看成是万恶的渊薮；没有把土地改革运动所完成的伟大历史任务，即：把广大农民从封建剥削制度束缚下解放出来，从而大大提高了人民经济的生产力所起的这一伟大作用的一方面和土地改革运动过程中所发生的曾是严重的但旋即被纠正的某些左的偏向的一方面加以区别。这是没有认识到，我们华北今天能有相对的和平环境，能在全国战争的情况下进行生产，进行各种建设，正是由于全国人民解放军在各个战场上的胜利所致，没有人民解放军的胜利，是一切都谈不到的。对于土地改革，纠正左的偏向，是必要的，如果不做这一步工作，要求农村安定、团结生产，就不可能。但如果看不见土地改革的伟大成绩，而仅仅对土地改革运动中所发生的某些左的偏向念念不忘，好象土地改革是多余的，而没有将生产救灾与土地改革的伟大成就相联系。那同样是错误的。所以也就不会认识到，由于全华北党政军民团结一致，英勇奋斗战胜严重灾荒的结果，我们终于获得了七成年景，这就是说，我们在生产救灾战线上获得了重大成绩。这个成绩之获得，首先而且主要地就应当归功于人民解放战争的胜利，就应当归功于土地改革的完成，难道这还不明白，而还需要加以什么证明么？试以华北解放区一九四二年及一九四三年的大旱灾和严重的蝗灾与今年的灾荒相比较，那末今天的形势之有利，与战胜灾害的主观力量之雄伟，就不可以道理计了。不错，长期战争人力和物力的动员，曾不能不给予人民以极大负担，土地改革中，在某一时间内，在若干具体政策上一度发生的“左”的偏向，又曾不能不给予人民生产事业以某些损害。但，在我人民解放军英勇奋斗争取全国人民解放的远大目标鼓舞下，在我后方反对浪费厉行节约，实行公平合理负担的廉洁的政治感召下，人民又有极高的觉悟，他们对战争的负担是乐意接受的，没有怨言的。而土地改革中间一度发生的“左”的偏向，也只是一时发生的逆流现象，并不是主流，并不是根本现象，而且不久即已经认真加以纠正。主要的、基本的事实，则是土地改革历史任务的完成，开辟了华北人民生产建设发展生产力的康庄大道。我们的任务，就在于教育与鼓励广大群众克服一时的困难，为永久利益与最后胜利而前进。试想如果没有人民解放战争与土地改革，中国人民的悲惨命运将是什么样子呢？难道还能脱出黑暗、压迫、饥饿、死亡的情况么？会比这种情况稍微好些么？今天国民党统治区的人民生活，就是现成标本，而那里的人民，正如饥如渴地盼望着人民解放战争和土地改革对他们所能带来的新生活的光明。我们对于战争和土地改革，正是需要从这样的观点去宣传的。
    那末，从这篇报导中，我们应得出什么教训呢？
    首先应该克服宣传工作中的客观主义倾向，客观主义的特征是喜欢把一大堆各不相属的现象，加以罗列，拜倒于自发论之前，常常是讴歌落后农民和小资产阶级的情感，他们不能透过现象的表面而找到本质的内在的联系，因而他们缺乏积极的能动的力量，只会坐在主流之旁对逆流浪花加以咀嚼和＠噪，屈服于客观困难之前，而没有勇气与力量去克服它。一句话，就是忽视革命运动中无产阶级先锋队的领导作用。客观主义者是没有党性的，他不是以马列主义的普遍真理与中国革命实践相结合的精神，即毛泽东思想的精神，去教育党和群众，而是以小资产阶级的颓废气氛沮丧志气来催眠党和群众；表现在思想方法上则是片面性的。客观主义倾向不仅在“全区人民团结斗争，战胜各种灾害”这篇报导中严重地表现出来，而且在我们报上其他某些新闻中也或多或少地表现着。有些新闻只是枯燥无味地罗列许多事实，没有思想，没有分析，没有目的。报纸上，近来许多批评是好的，有益的，但也有些批评往往只是消极的指摘，没有着重分析错误发生的原因，及其产生的条件，积极指出改正与前进的方法。积极鼓舞和指导，应该是我们宣传工作上以及一切批评与自我批评上所必需具备的精神。忽视积极的鼓舞和指导，是不能容许的有害的客观主义倾向。
    我们在报导中以及工作中所以发生上述或类似上述的缺点和错误，主要原因就是理论水平不高。因此有时就不自觉地把党报降低到不觉悟的群众的思想水平，不能很好发挥党报应有的指导作用。经过这次错误的教训以后，我们将努力加强理论学习与政策观点策略观点的学习，把我们的党报提高一步。
