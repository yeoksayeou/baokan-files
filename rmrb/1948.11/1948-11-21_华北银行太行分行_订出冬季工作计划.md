　　Taihang Branch of the North China Bank
　　Formulates Winter Work Plan
　　[Taihang Dispatch] The Taihang Branch of the North China Bank convened an enlarged meeting of managers of various special district offices in late September, during which the winter work plan for 1948 was discussed and formulated. The plan is divided into three parts. The first part is rural credit work, which includes two main components: 1. Handling winter production loans, requiring the following: (1) Genuinely support the masses in winter production and lay a solid material foundation for next year's large-scale production movement. On the basis of restoring and developing agricultural and sideline production, implement the principle of "benefiting both public and private sectors, and benefiting both labor and capital." To this end, 1.6 billion yuan has been earmarked for water conservancy projects and livestock breeding. Local authorities should create plans for this special fund, which will be allocated after approval by the administrative office and the branch. The remaining 2 billion yuan for agricultural and sideline production (including rural cooperatives and scattered handicraft workshops) will be managed by each county. However, it must be used in a concentrated manner based on the principles of restoring and developing production, combined with the specific production conditions of the county, and special attention should be paid to cultivating sheep flocks. The use of loans and regional allocation should be planned by each county and implemented after approval by the branch and the office. Oppose relief viewpoints, equal distribution, and tailism. (2) Fully implement the system of borrowing goods and lending real items, and repaying with real items, or converting loans into real terms. The main production materials of the borrower should be used as the calculation standard for in-kind loans. Continue to experiment with in-kind deposits. In addition to the branch continuing experiments in Wu'an and Licheng, each county can pilot in one village or one district. (3) Have lending and repayment, be flexible and accurate, and have flexible borrowing and repayment times. To this end, it is necessary to change the organizational form. Branches should set up business offices, taking economic zones as units, relying on a major town. In addition to being responsible for rural credit work in this area, they should also engage in market industry and commerce, and combine the two. Universal setup in Wu'an and Licheng, and other inland counties should first pilot a point and gradually promote it according to the conditions. 2. Combine with winter production to rectify credit cooperatives. The requirements are: (1) Strive for all or most credit cooperatives (departments) to resume business, and establish new cooperatives (departments) and cooperative credit businesses as appropriate. And strive for 10% to be consolidated. (2) Experiment with in-kind lending. Licheng and Wu'an universally implement it, and other counties should first do a good job in one village. (3) Before the end of November, make a registration and understanding of the overall situation of credit cooperatives in the entire region, and establish a rural credit investigation system and an interest rate investigation system.

　　华北银行太行分行
  　订出冬季工作计划
    【太行电】华北银行太行分行九月下旬召开的各专区办事处经理扩大会议中，讨论制定了一九四八年冬季工作计划。该计划共分三部分。第一部分是农村信贷工作。其中有两项主要内容：一、办理冬季生产贷款，要求做到：（一）确实扶助群众冬季生产，为明年大生产运动打下坚实的物质基础。在恢复与发展农副业生产基础上，贯彻“公私两利、劳资两利”原则。为此，确定十六亿元资金为兴修水利、繁殖牲口之专款。此项专款由各地作出计划，由行署及分行批准后拨给。其余农副业（包括农村合作社及分散的手工业作坊）贷款资金二十亿元，由各县自行掌握。但必须根据恢复与发展生产原则，结合该县生产具体条件，集中使用，并特别注意培植羊群。贷款用途及地区分配，各县作出计划，经分行及办事处批准执行。反对救济观点、平均分散与尾巴主义。（二）全部改为借物贷实，贷实还实，或贷款折实。实物贷款以贷款者主要生产物质为计算标准。继续试行实物存款，除分行在武安、黎城继续进行实验外，各县可试办一个村或一个区。（三）有收有放，活泼准确，借还时间灵活。为此，必须改变组织形式，支行设营业所，以经济区为单位，依托一个主要市镇。除负责本区农村信贷工作外，兼营市场工商业，并把两者结合起来。武安、黎城普遍设置，其他腹地各县首先试办一个点，根据条件逐步推广。二、结合冬季生产，整顿信用合作社。要求做到：（一）争取全部或大部信用社（部）恢复营业，并相机建立新社（部），和合作社信用业务。并争取百分之十做到巩固。（二）试行实物借贷。黎城、武安普遍试行，其他各县首先做好一个村。（三）十一月底以前，对全区信用社概况作一登记与了解，建立农村信用调查制度与利息调查制。
