　　Baoding Citizens Warmly Welcome Our Army
  　Revolutionary Order Quickly Established
    [Baoding Electric] Revolutionary order in Baoding City is being rapidly established. After our People's Liberation Army (PLA) garrison troops entered the city, order within the city immediately stabilized. Only five hours had elapsed since Liu Huanan's bandit troops were forced to flee in a panic. After the PLA entered the city, they immediately dispatched high-volume broadcasts and bicycle teams to reassure the city's merchants and residents and strictly prohibited citizens from looting enemy and puppet materials. Sentries were quickly dispatched to all major roads and enemy/puppet warehouses. Citizens, who have suffered for ten years, warmly welcomed the PLA. The city's Chamber of Commerce and other organizations sent representatives, and citizens gathered temporarily at the South Gate to warmly welcome the vanguard of the PLA entering the city. Citizens eagerly read the joint proclamation of the Jizhong Administrative Office and the Jizhong Military Region and attentively listened to the policy propaganda of the democratic government staff. Citizens and agency employees have a considerable understanding of our Party's urban policies. Several employees of the city's post office, after avoiding the enemy's forced evacuation, have now gathered and gone to the streets to find our troops, asking if the municipal government has entered the city and requesting to take over. A reporter interviewed the city's telephone bureau. A worker, Mr. Li, told the reporter: "Now (referring to the day our army liberated Baoding) there is only one person in the bureau. Today, I blocked the door tightly, fearing that the bureau's things would be messed up. There are also more than a dozen barrels of gasoline, which have been buried." He pointed to the machine and said, "This is our rice bowl, how can we destroy it? It will be useful in the future." He led the reporter to visit the machine room. The switchboard's transmitters and circuit plugs were still orderly hung up, as if the employees had just finished work. Liu, a worker at the Xiushui Hutong postal branch, said: "More than a dozen of us originally planned to gather at 10:00 tomorrow morning to await orders." The people of Baoding are now vigorously restoring their city with a new spirit.
    [Baoding Electric] After the Baoding City garrison troops and cadres entered the city, they conscientiously observed the entry discipline. Personnel from agencies and troops do not enter shops or residences without reason. Before the currency exchange rate is set, everyone refrains from buying things. The troops guarding the various warehouses are conscientious and responsible, and no one uses any of the assets casually. The soldiers of the Fourth Company of a certain unit, who were guarding a warehouse, preferred to sleep on the ground rather than use anything inside. The sentry personnel at each street entrance and city gate are not only responsible for checking pedestrians but also carry out propaganda and comfort at any time. Some soldiers are writing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention at their posts. Citizens deeply feel the strict discipline of the PLA, and some automatically boil water for them to drink.

　　保定市民热烈欢迎我军
  　革命秩序迅速建立
    【保定电】保定市革命秩序正迅速建立。我解放军卫戍部队进入城内后，城内秩序即已稳定。时距刘化南匪部被迫仓惶逃窜时间仅五小时。解放军入城后，马上派出高房广播及自行车队，对全市商民进行安抚，并严格禁止市民抢搬敌伪物资。各要道及敌伪仓库，均迅速派出岗哨。十年来饱受蹂躏之市民，亲切欢迎解放军。市商会等各机关，派出代表及临时汇集之市民，于南门内热烈欢迎解放军入城之先头部队。市民争阅冀中行政公署与冀中军区之联合布告，并专心听取民主政府工作人员的政策宣传。市民及机关职工，对我党城市政策，已有相当了解。市邮局之数名职工，在避过敌人之强迫撤退后，现已集合起来，到街上找我部队，询问市政府是否已入城，要求接管。记者访问了市电话局，工人李某告记者说：“现在（指我军解放保定那天）局里只有一个人，今天我把门堵的结结实实的，怕把局里的东西弄乱了。还有十几筒汽油，已经埋好了。”他指着机器说：“这就是我们的饭碗，我们怎能去破坏它呢？将来好用呀。”他领记者参观机房，排工的送话器及电路插上仍有秩序的排挂，象职员们才下了工一样。秀水胡同邮政支局工人刘某说：“我们十几个人，原定好了明天早十点集合，听候命令。”保定人民刻正以新的心情，大力恢复自己的城市。
    【保定电】保定市警备部队及干部入城后，认真遵守入城纪律。机关部队人员，都不无故进入商店或民宅。在货币比价没有规定前，大家都不购买东西。看管各种仓库的部队，都认真负责，没有一个人随便动用资财。某部四连看管仓库的战士们，宁愿睡在地上，却不动用一点东西。各街口与城门上的岗哨人员，不仅切实负责检查行人，且随时进行宣传、慰问。有的战士在自己岗位上书写着三大纪律和八项注意。市民深感解放军的纪律严明，有的自动给烧水喝。
