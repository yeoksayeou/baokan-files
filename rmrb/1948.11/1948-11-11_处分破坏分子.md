　　Punishing Saboteurs
    Striving for construction and developing production, "increasing production by an inch on the existing foundation," is a crucial link in defeating Chiang Kai-shek and striving for overall victory. Therefore, acts of sabotage against production must not be tolerated. However, the recent incidents of sabotage against the autumn harvest in the Jizhong and Jinnan areas of the North China Liberated Area are worthy of serious attention.
    According to reports from Jizhong and Jinnan, acts of sabotage against production can be divided into two categories: First, a small number of idlers and vagrants engage in theft. These people should be strictly controlled and punished by local governments, and at the same time, they should be supervised, educated, and reformed through the masses. Second, there are retaliatory acts by bad elements and sabotage activities by counter-revolutionary elements. For example, setting fire to crops and threshing grounds, pulling out crops, etc. This is clearly a serious criminal act of deliberate sabotage. Some of these are counter-revolutionary elements, and some are retaliatory acts, but all are acts of sabotage and must be severely punished. Local governments and public security departments must not be indifferent to these incidents of sabotage against production; they must be seriously vigilant and completely stop them. In the process of land reform, some places have experienced phenomena of wrongly struggling against middle peasants and excessive struggles against landlords and rich peasants. This deviation should be seriously corrected, on the one hand. But on the other hand, if there are some incorrigible bad elements who deliberately sabotage the fruits of the laboring people's production, this must not be allowed! Especially for some counter-revolutionary elements who are utilized and bought by Kuomintang agents to carry out sabotage against us, they must be severely punished. These saboteurs should be investigated and interrogated by judicial and public security organs respectively, and dealt with according to the severity of their circumstances. Those with particularly serious circumstances should be sentenced to death. Only in this way can we ensure the tranquility of the broad masses of people and the development of production.

　　处分破坏分子
    努力建设，发展生产，“把生产在现有的基础上提高一寸”，这是打垮蒋介石、争取全面胜利的重要环节。因此，决不能容许对于生产的破坏事件。但最近华北解放区的冀中区和冀南区发生了不少破坏秋收事件，是值得严重注意的。
    根据冀中、冀南的报导，对生产的破坏事件，可分为两类：第一、是少数不务正业的游民分子，进行偷盗。这种人，应由各地方政府严加管束，并给以处分，同时应经过群众加以监督、教育和改造。第二、是坏分子的报复行为，和反革命分子的破坏活动。例如放火烧毁庄稼和烧场，拔掉农作物等。这显然是一种故意破坏的严重犯罪行为。其中有些是反革命分子，有些则是报复行为，但都是破坏行为，都必须加以严厉的处分。各地方政府及公安部门对于这些破坏生产事件，决不应麻木不仁，必须严重警惕，完全制止。在土地改革过程中，某些地方曾发生过错斗中农，和对地主富农斗争过火的现象，对这种偏向应该认真地纠正，这是一方面。但另方面，假如有一些顽固不化的坏分子，故意破坏劳动人民的生产果实，则决定不能允许！尤其是对一些被国民党特务利用、收买，对我进行破坏的反革命分子，则必须严厉制裁。对于这些破坏分子应由司法、公安机关分别加以追究和审讯，按其情节轻重分别处办，其情节十分重大者则应处以极刑。只有如此，才能保障广大人民群众的安宁与生产的发展。
