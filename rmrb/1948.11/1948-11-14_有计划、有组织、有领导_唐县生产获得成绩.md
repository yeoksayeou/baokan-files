Planned, Organized, and Led
Tang County Achieves Production Success

[Our Newspaper's Report] This year, in the nine-month production campaign in Tang County, Beiyue District, significant achievements have been made in various aspects, including spring plowing, seizing the time to sow, eliminating wasteland, organizing women to work, repairing dikes and dredging canals, planting trees and afforestation, breeding livestock, developing sideline occupations, and eliminating pests.

After the land reform in the county, the County Committee convened a meeting at the beginning of March, quickly transitioning to spring plowing and production, launching a campaign to rush sowing and eliminate wasteland, and implementing field inspections to identify wasteland. As a result, mountainous and sloping land was sown before May, eliminating more than 4,300 mu of both cultivated and uncultivated wasteland. More than 9,000 jin of improved varieties of wheat such as "72" wheat and "81" millet were also promoted. Subsequently, women were organized on a large scale to participate in weeding, with more than 90 percent of farmland undergoing two or three weedings. In mid-August, armyworms infested the county, affecting 11,436 mu of farmland. The county and district immediately organized the affected areas to stop all other work, and cadres personally went to the fields to lead the masses in capturing and killing the pests, preventing a major disaster.

In terms of water conservancy construction, due to the great importance attached by the leadership and the establishment of the Tang River Beach Management Committee, the committee actively led and supervised the completion of nine-tenths (33) of the original plan of 37 dike repairs, four and a half times the original plan of nine dam repairs, three times the original plan of forty canal repairs, and twice the original plan of seven sluice gate repairs. The leadership implemented education on the public ownership of the Tang River and organized joint management among the masses. During this year's severe drought when the river dried up, the seven villages on the west bank of the upper reaches of the Tang River stopped using water for two days and one night, releasing the water to save more than 2,000 mu of rice seedlings in six villages including Zhanghezhuang. It also allowed three to four inches of fertile mud to be deposited on the beaches along the Tang River, guaranteeing 70% of the normal rice harvest this year. This summer, rescue operations were also organized in a timely manner. Although the Tang River rose to nearly the 1945 water level, the damage to the beach was minimal. In the well-irrigated areas, the county set up well-drilling and waterwheel installation teams, lending money to the masses to add more than 130 waterwheels, increasing irrigated land by nearly 2,000 mu. Thus, efforts were made to achieve 70% of the normal harvest for the entire county this year, with some areas even reaching 100%.

In terms of forestry and animal husbandry, nearly 90,000 trees were planted in spring and summer, exceeding the original plan by 180%, with a survival rate of over 95%. In terms of livestock breeding, all labor services and corvée duties were waived for livestock specifically used for breeding. Three mass livestock farms (non-collective feeding) were established in Chayezhuang, the first district, with 62 female donkeys specifically for breeding. They have already foaled or are pregnant. According to statistics from the three districts alone, 397 newborn foals were produced, achieving the county's plan of breeding 400 heads.

In terms of developing sideline production, the masses were organized to spin, weave, make shoes, dig for medicinal herbs, and engage in other sideline occupations, with an income of approximately 300,000 jin of millet. Thirty percent of women in mountainous areas participated in agricultural production, and 60% participated in sideline production. The income from women's sideline production even accounted for 60% to 100% of the total family income, greatly increasing the capital for agricultural production.

The main reasons for the above achievements are that the leadership paid special attention to leading production, and the County Committee served as the core, implementing unified leadership over production. Secondly, professional cadres with experience, interest, and confidence in completing the various tasks, such as dike and water repair, livestock breeding, etc., were organized to lead and carry them out. Thirdly, the government actively supported with grain and funds, and mobilized and organized private capital activities.

　　有计划、有组织、有领导
  　唐县生产获得成绩
    【本报讯】北岳区唐县今年九个月的生产运动，在春耕抢种灭荒，组织妇女劳动，修堤疏渠，植树造林，繁殖牲畜，开展副业，消灭虫害等各方面，都获得了相当成绩。
    该县在土改以后，三月初即召开区委会议，迅速转入春耕生产，突击播种，并发动灭荒运动，实行田间查荒。结果山地坡地均于五月前播种完毕，消灭了四千三百余亩生熟荒地。并推广优良品种“七二”小麦，“八一”谷等九千余斤。接着大量组织妇女参加锄苗，百分之九十以上的农田都进行了二锄、三锄。八月中旬，全县普遍发生黏虫，被灾农田一一四三六亩，县、区立即组织虫灾区停止一切工作，干部亲自下地，领导群众捕打，结果未使造成大的灾害。
    水利建设方面，由于领导上非常重视，并成立了唐河滩地管理委员会，积极领导督促，修理完成了原计划三十七条的十分之九（三十三条），修坝完成了原计划九条的四倍半，修渠完成了原计划四十条的三倍，修水闸完成了原计划七个的二倍。领导上对群众贯彻了唐河公有及组织起来共同管理的教育，在今年酷旱河干之时，停止了上游唐河西岸七个村两天一夜的使水，放下水来救活了张合庄等六村两千余亩的稻秧。又使唐河沿岸各滩都普遍淤上了三四寸的肥泥，保证了今年稻田的七成年景。今年夏季，并及时组织了抢险，在唐河上涨将近一九四五年的水位时，而滩地冲毁很少。在井浇地区，县里设了打井及装水车小组，共贷出与群众增添水车一百三十余辆，增加水地将近两千亩。这样争取今年全县达到七成收，有些地方并达到十成。
    在林木与牧畜方面，春夏两季共植树将近九万株，超过原计划的百分之一百八十，成活率在百分之九十五以上。繁殖牲畜方面，对专做繁殖之牲口免去一切勤务差役，在一区茶叶庄建立了三个群众性的牧畜场（非集体喂养），有六十二头母驴，专做繁殖之用，并已下驹或怀驹。仅三个区的统计，新生小驴小驹三百九十七头，达到了全县繁殖四百头的计划。
    开展副业生产方面，组织群众纺织做鞋，刨药材和开展其他副业，群众收入约在三十万斤小米左右。山地妇女百分之三十参加农业生产，百分之六十参加副业生产，妇女副业生产收入，甚至占到全家总收入的百分之六十到一百，大大增加了农业生产的资本。
    以上成绩获得的原因，最主要的是领导上特别注意领导生产，并以县委为核心，实行了对生产的统一领导。其次是根据各种不同事业，如修堤修水，繁殖牲畜等，组织对各该不同事业具有经验、兴趣与完成信心的专业干部去领导进行。第三是政府以粮款积极扶助，并动员与组织了私资活动。
