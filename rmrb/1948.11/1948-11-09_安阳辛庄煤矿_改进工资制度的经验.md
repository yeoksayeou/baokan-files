　　The Experience of Xinzhuang Coal Mine in Anyang in Improving the Wage System

　　After experimentation, the Xinzhuang Coal Mine in Anyang broke the egalitarian wage system and implemented piece-rate wages, which led to an improvement in quality. The experiment went through the following stages:

　　I. Wage and Production Situation Before Changing the Wage System

　　The old wage system of the mine was a collective piece-rate system, paying equal wages based on the number of workdays required for the amount of coal produced. In 1946, the county government uniformly stipulated seven jin of millet per workday, equivalent to sixteen jin in old weights, plus supplementary benefits of 150 jin of coal and one jin of steamed buns. After it was converted to public ownership in May of last year, this old system was also adopted. In July, the local area suffered a severe drought, and funds were tight. The higher authorities called for wage cuts. Due to the county trade union's insistence on high wages at the time, the mine was forced to stop production in early August. When work resumed in October, the wages were slightly reduced, stipulating fourteen jin of millet per workday, plus supplementary benefits of twenty jin of coal and one jin of steamed buns. The factory paid wages at an average of fourteen jin per person, with workers rating each other. The difference in points was very small, with the highest being ninety-eight to one hundred points and the lowest around ninety points. The wage difference between skilled workers and ordinary workers, strong and weak laborers, and skilled and unskilled workers was only about three jin of millet. The wage policy still reflected serious egalitarianism, which led to egalitarianism in production and the conservatism of skilled workers. Each person would stop digging after extracting three baskets of coal. They would rest underground before the end of the workday. A few people did not participate in the main labor underground but received the same wages, and there were even instances of people drawing wages for empty names. Because there were no rewards or punishments, many workers did not dig coal according to the rules of the coal seam, digging more where the coal was soft and leaving support pillars where the coal was hard. The coal seams were often uneven, affecting production and constantly threatening the safety of the workers.

　　II. Preparatory Work for Changing the System

　　Before the change, most workers did not understand what piece-rate wages were all about. Their attitude was "go along with the flow, do it if it suits me, quit if it doesn't," "no matter what, wages must be raised." During the period of discussion, the factory leaders went to the Fengfeng Mine for a week of observation. Combining the new problems discovered by the Fengfeng Mine in changing the system, we studied our conditions and the preparatory work for changing wages.

　　First, our conditions are different from those of the Fengfeng Mine. It is not a matter of wages being too high, but of rationalizing wages by breaking egalitarianism. We estimated that most able-bodied and skilled workers would support the new method as long as they understood it. Ordinary workers would be able to follow, and only a few unskilled or unwilling people might resist. We decided to unite 30 to 40 percent of active workers, strive for most workers to follow, persuade the few who might resist, and decided that trade union cadres would be responsible for educating the workers in depth.

　　Second, the labor standards, wage standards, product inspection, labor discipline, accounting methods, forms, and books must all be newly created or revised along with the change in the wage system. Considering the conditions of our engineering and technical cadres, mastering this complex system was a difficult new problem. After the Fengfeng Mine changed its system, it required twenty-seven people to leave production to work on this. Considering that the increase in the number of people leaving production due to the change in the system was not in line with the new spirit of management, we could only improve on the original basis and must study and create ways to solve this problem. Before August 20, the engineering department was responsible for completing the measurement and marking of the roadway distance, slope size, and designing and manufacturing various accounting tables and books, and the accountants were familiar with the calculation methods for various types of work.

　　Third, it was decided that the period from August 21 to August 31 would be the experimental period. During the experimental period, formal wages would be paid according to the new regulations and standards, and the new labor standards and wage standards would be implemented. Any unreasonable aspects would be modified.

　　III. Problems Encountered in the Experiment

　　After ten days of experimentation, we realized that changing the new system was a very complex matter. The problems encountered were as follows:

　　First, we did not fully understand the difficulties and resistance to changing the new system. The mobilization, education, and unity of workers were not carried out strongly enough. A few smart-aleck workers took advantage of the fact that most workers had not accepted the new system and carried out activities to resist, saying sarcastic things. For example, "Change it, and we'll earn less money. What are we going to eat if we don't eat gruel? They're experimenting, so let's experiment too!" So they deliberately went slow and didn't work hard. Those who could set up five or six timber supports only set up three, and those who could dig more than one meter only dug fifty or sixty centimeters. Under their pressure, the upright workers did not dare to speak up. In this situation, we decided that we must firmly support the honest workers and good cadres. However, some upright workers also reflected that the new labor standards were set too high. We convened a meeting of underground cadres, accepted the correct opinions of the masses, and re-examined and revised the standards. When the workers saw that their correct opinions were quickly accepted by the leadership, their morale stabilized, and the production effect also improved. Those smart-aleck workers who didn't work were not given credit for their work, and they realized that they couldn't get away with not working hard in the future, so they calmed down.

　　Second, when implementing piece-rate wages, quality inspection is the most important link. At the beginning, we did not organize this work well. The accountants were unfamiliar with underground work, and the technical instructors and production team leaders did not seriously take responsibility for checking quality, resulting in the use of old wood for timbering and not using props for the kiln. Therefore, at the end of the workday, the accountants, production team leaders, and technical instructors must combine to conduct quantity and quality inspections; otherwise, they will only pursue quantity.

　　Third, setting standards must be done carefully, and thorough investigation and research should be conducted beforehand to avoid the mistake of setting them too high or too low. At the beginning, the standards for extracting old props were set too high, and only a few people could meet them, causing most people to be disappointed. The standards for carpentry were set too low, and most people met or exceeded them. Later, when we raised them slightly, it caused ideological concerns among the workers, who were afraid that if they exceeded the standards, they would be raised again.

　　After twenty days of effort and exploration, the workers' morale has stabilized, the new system has been accepted and affirmed by the vast majority of workers, and output has begun to increase somewhat. For example, some old props used to pay no attention to producing lump coal. Since the wage policy rewarded the production of lump coal, several old props have produced 30 to 40 percent lump coal. Lump coal sells for twenty-four yuan per jin, which is twice as high as coal fines. Everyone feels that this is a good way to achieve mutual benefit for both the public and private sectors.

### 安阳辛庄煤矿　改进工资制度的经验

　　安阳辛庄煤矿
  　改进工资制度的经验
    安阳辛庄煤矿经过实验摸索，打破了平均主义的工资制，实行按件计资后，质量开始提高。其实验经过如下：
    一、改变工资制度前的工资情况与生产情况该矿旧的工资制度是集体计件制，按工数要煤数，按工数平均付给相等的工资。一九四六年县府统一规定每工七斤米，合老秤十六斤，外加附属待遇煤一百五十斤，馍一斤。去年五月改为公营后，也采用了这个旧制度。七月间当地旱灾严重，资金困难，上级号召减资。由于当时县工会坚持高工资政策，到八月初即被迫停工。十月间复工后，才把工资稍降低了一些，规定每工小米十四市斤，外加附属待遇煤二十斤、馍一斤。工厂支付工资按每人平均十四斤付给，由工人自己评分。工人评的分差额很小，最高九十八至一百分，最低也在九十分左右，所得工资最高不过十五斤，最低十三斤，技术工人与普通工人，劳力强的与劳力弱的，熟手与生手相差不过三斤米。工资政策上仍然表现着严重的平均主义，因此就产生了生产上的平均主义与技工的保守现象。每人出够三筐煤就再不多挖了。不到收工时间就在井下休息。少数人在井下不参加主要劳动，也不少得工资，甚至还有吃空名字的。由于没有奖惩，不少工人刨煤不按煤洞规矩，煤软就多刨，煤硬就留下行道，煤洞经常是左一个凹右一个凸，影响生产，并经常威胁着工人生命安全。
    二、改变制度的准备工作
    改变前大部分工人不了解按件计资是怎么一回事，态度是“随着走吧，合着就干，合不着就算”，“不管怎样，工资总得提高一些”。酝酿期间，工厂领导上到峰峰矿作了一星期的考察，结合峰峰矿在改变制度中发现的新问题，研究了我们的条件与改变工资的准备工作。
    第一、我们的条件与峰峰矿不同，不是工资过高的问题，而是打破平均主义使工资合理化。我们估计了大部分能劳动有技术的工人，只要他们了解了新办法，就会拥护的。一般工人能够跟上走，只有少数没技术或不愿劳动的人可能抵抗。我们确定团结百分之三四十积极工人，争取大部分工人跟上走，说服少数可能抵抗的工人，并决定由工会干部负责深入工人中作教育。
    第二、劳动标准与工资标准的鳌定，产品的检验，劳动纪律，计工办法，表报簿计等都得随工资制度的改变而新制或修改。研究我们工务干部的条件，对熟习与掌握这一套复杂的制度是个很困难的新问题。峰峰矿改变制度后，需要二十七个人脱离生产搞这一工作。我们考虑到脱离生产人员因改制度而增多与新的经营管理精神不合，因此只能在原有基础上提高，必须研究创造办法解决这个问题。八月二十日前，工务科负责完成行洞距离坡度大小的测量标计及设计制造各种记工表计工簿等，计工员熟练各种工的计算办法。
    第三、确定八月二十一日起到三十一日为实验期，在实验期内，正式工资按新规定标准，执行新的劳动标准与工资标准，发现不合理处予以修改。
    三、实验中遇到的问题
    经过十来天的实验，我们体验到改变新制度是非常复杂的事情，遇到的问题有以下几点：
    第一、我们对于改变新制度的困难与阻力认识不够，动员教育团结工人的工作进行的没有力量，少数俏皮工人趁大部分工人没有接受新制度的时候，在工人中进行活动抵抗，说怪话。如说“改稀哩，赚的钱少了，不吃稀吃啥。他们实验哩，咱也实验实验吧！”于是故意怠工不干，能下五六柱架木的只下三柱，能刨一米多只刨五六十公分。正派工人在他们的压力下不敢抬头。在这种情况下，我们研究非坚决给老实工人及好的干部撑腰不可。但有些正派工人也反映新的劳动标准订的高，我们召集了井下干部会议，接受群众正确意见，重新审查修正了标准。工人看到自己正确的意见很快就被领导接受，情绪就走上稳定，生产效果也随着提高。那些俏皮工人不劳动，就不给他们记工，他们感到以后不好好干吃不开了，才老实下去。
    第二、实行按件计资，质量检查是个最重要的环节。我们在开始时没有很好的组织这个工作，计工员对井下工作是生疏的，技术指导员与生产队长没有认真负起检查质量的责任，发生木工下棚子使用旧木头及不打柱窑的现象。因此在收工时候，计工员与生产队长技术指导员必须结合一致，进行数量质量检查，否则就会光追求数量。
    第三、定标准必须慎重，事先应进行周密调查研究，不犯过高或过低的毛病。我们在开始时，老＠的标准订的高了，只有个别人能达到，多数人都失望。木工的标准订的低了，大部分人都达到或超过标准。以后提高了一下，又引起工人思想上的顾虑，怕超过标准再给提高。
    经过二十天的努力摸索，工人情绪已经稳定，新制度已为绝大部分工人接受肯定下来，产量也开始有些提高。如一些老＠过去都不注意出炭块，自工资政策奖励出炭块后，有几个老＠都出到三成到四成炭块，炭块每斤售价二十四元，比煤面高一倍，都感到这样是达到公私两利的好办法。　（太行分社）
