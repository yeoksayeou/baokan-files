　　Clarify the Purpose, Dispel Concerns
    Inspire Party Members to Consciously Rectify the Party
  　Yicheng Summarizes the First Phase of Party Rectification
    The first batch of thirty-four basic-level villages in Yicheng County began preliminary party rectification around October 18th and had concluded by the 7th of this month. Most branches achieved the purpose of preliminary party rectification, consciously reviewed the mistakes of branch party members that violated the interests of the people, discovered many activists, purged individual alien elements, and the organization was generally consolidated. The vast majority of party members began to work vividly and actively, initially improving and strengthening their relationship with the masses. During this preliminary party rectification, the county party committee found that the reason most villages did a better job was that they clearly recognized that the central issue to be resolved in party rectification was to strengthen the relationship between the Party and the masses. On the one hand, according to the level of awareness of party members, different methods were adopted to gradually improve their understanding of the Party and to carry out criticism and self-criticism; on the other hand, activists were relied upon to promote the work, discover problems, and analyze problems, so that party members regarded party rectification as their own business. Previously, some party members who had concerns about party rectification also eliminated their doubts and began to check the work of the branch with the help of the work team, distinguishing between merits and demerits, right and wrong, the severity of the mistakes, and reviewing their own shortcomings in their work, as well as mistakes such as being lured by landlords and rich peasants, losing their stance, and embezzling or occupying more fruits of labor. In addition, in some villages where the work foundation was weak, the branches were all new. The work team only saw that the branches were complex, there were few party members, their awareness was low, and their understanding was poor, and they believed that relying on the branch to rectify the party would not work, so they implemented the erroneous practice of "the higher level rectifying the lower level," without focusing on inspiring party members' consciousness and relying on activists within the party to rectify the party. Some merely asked party members to reflect based on the materials they had collected, to see how many points the party members admitted; or based on the materials they had collected, they saw that the party members had reflected almost enough, and they thought that the rectification had been completed. This made the party members feel that party rectification was being carried out by the higher level, or misunderstood "party rectification" as "striking." Some comrades, although reflecting on many things, regretted it later, while others went through the order once and considered the preliminary party rectification completed. The reasons for these deviations are that, first, the cadres did not study the District Party Committee's party rectification report well and had a vague understanding of the party rectification's guiding principles and objectives, resorting to any means and being anxious for quick results. Second, when the county assigned the work, it also failed to formulate different work plans based on the different situations of new and old branches. After studying these situations, the county party committee has instructed its subordinate cadres to correctly accept these experiences and lessons and prepare conditions for the next step of work. The County Party Committee is currently studying the methods and steps for transitioning to the end of land reform in combination with party rectification.

### 弄清目的解除顾虑  启发党员自觉整党　翼城总结第一期整党

　　弄清目的解除顾虑
    启发党员自觉整党
  　翼城总结第一期整党
    翼城第一批三十四个基点村，自十月十八日前后开始进行初步整党，到本月七日已先后结束。大部分支部到了初步整党的目的，自觉的检讨了支部党员违反人民利益的错误，发现了不少积极分子，清洗了个别的异己分子，组织上一般的得到整顿，绝大部分党员开始生动的积极的工作，初步改善与密切了群众关系。在这次初步整党中，经县委研究，大部村庄搞得较好的原因，一个是明确认识了整党要解决的中心问题是密切党与群众的关系。一方面根据党员觉悟程度，采取不同的办法逐步提高他们对党的认识，开展批评与自我批评；另一方面是依靠积极分子推动工作，发现问题，分析问题，使党员把整党看成是自己的事情。以前有部分对整党有顾虑的党员，也消除了疑虑，开始在工作组帮助下检查支部工作，分别功过是非，错误的大小轻重，检讨自己工作中的毛病，以及受地主富农利诱，失掉立场贪污多占果实等错误。另外，在某些工作基础薄弱的村庄，支部都是新的，工作组只看见支部复杂、党员少、觉悟低、认识差等等，就认为依靠支部整党搞不成，便实行“上级整下级”的错误作法，不着重启发党员自觉，不依靠党内积极分子整党，有的仅根据自己收集的材料，让党员反省，看党员承认了几条；或者根据自己收集的材料，看见党员反省的差不多，便认为已经整好了。这样使党员感到整党就是上级来整，或把“整党”误解为是“打击”，有的同志虽然反省出许多东西，以后又懊悔了，有的是按着次序过一遍，便算完成初步整党。造成这些偏向的原因，一是干部对区党委的整党报告没有很好研究，对整党的方针目的认识模糊，不择手段，急于求成。二是县上布置工作时，也未能根据新老支部的不同情况定出不同的工作计划。县委研究了这些情况后，已指示所属干部正确接受这些经验教训，为下一步工作准备条件。现县委正在研究转入结束土改结合整党的方法与步骤。
