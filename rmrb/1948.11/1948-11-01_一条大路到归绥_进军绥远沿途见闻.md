Xinhua News Agency, Sui-Mongolian Front:
    Advancing into Suiyuan: On the road to Gui Sui

    Following the People's Liberation Army from the border of Jin-Sui, through the strategic pass of Sha Hu Kou, a gateway to the frontier, crossing the virtually non-existent Great Wall, we entered Suiyuan, advancing towards the lair of the bandit Fu Zuoyi.

    "The Eighth Route Army is back!" This heartening news quickly spread throughout the rural areas of southern Suiyuan. Contrary to the claims of "scorched earth" by the Fu bandit and the Central News Agency, the peasants were doing everything in their power to help the People's Liberation Army. One night, the troops groped their way forward in the mountainous terrain of southern Suiyuan. We were troubled by the pitch-black darkness. Suddenly, a faint light appeared ahead, growing closer and closer. I vaguely saw a figure and guessed it must be a robust peasant lighting the way for the People's Liberation Army. But as the figure adjusted the lamp, and the light brightened, I saw clearly that it was an old peasant woman. She kept warmly greeting the soldiers: "Go north! Comrades, a highway to Gui Sui!"

    There are many dogs in the rural areas of Suiyuan, which the peasants use to guard against sudden raids by Fu bandit at night to seize men and grain. Before this advance, the soldiers warned me to be careful of them. However, along the way, neither I nor the soldiers walking with me were bitten by dogs. It turned out that the peasants had tied up all the dogs upon seeing the People's Liberation Army.

    One day, in Yang Po Yao Zi Village in Liangcheng, I saw an old white-haired woman clutching the sleeve of a People's Liberation Army soldier, asking him: "Has Squad Leader Wang come?" "Which Squad Leader Wang?" "Tall, with a rectangular face, twenty years old this year. He stayed at my house this spring and was very diligent in helping me carry water and sweep the yard!" The soldier laughed and thanked the old woman on behalf of Squad Leader Wang for her remembrance.

    Along the way, I frequently saw peasants with broken legs and arms in the villages. They were either maimed by the Fu bandit or self-inflicted wounds to avoid being drafted by the Fu bandit. Many old men and women tearfully recounted to me how their sons had been seized by the Fu bandit and the incidents of those who were caught trying to escape and buried alive by the Fu bandit. Countless young men have already been assassinated by the Fu bandit, while their parents are still hoping for their sons to return!

    On the earthen walls of villages along the way, slogans of the Fu bandit were written everywhere: "Those who do not implement scorched earth will be killed!" "Those who do not provide information will be killed!" "Those who supply the enemy with materials will be killed!" "Those who hide enemy spies will be killed!" "Those who collaborate with the bandits will be killed!" Countless "kills," "reeking of killing intent" -- this is the true face of the "stable order" boasted by the Fu bandit in its controlled areas. The Fu Zuoyi bandit gang has so many enemies that the slogans are full of "enemies" and "bandits." These "enemies" and "bandits" are none other than the people of Suiyuan.

    Now, the propaganda teams of the People's Liberation Army are everywhere washing away the Fu bandit's "kill" slogans and rewriting them with: "All enemy personnel who do not resist this army with weapons will not be arrested as prisoners of war by this army."

### 一条大路到归绥  进军绥远沿途见闻

    一条大路到归绥
    进军绥远沿途见闻
    记者随解放军从晋绥边境的杀虎口这个与塞外交通的孔道，跨过实际上已不存在的万里长城，踏入绥远，向傅匪作义的老巢进军。
    “八路军打回来了。”这个令人欣喜的消息，很快地传遍了绥南农村。跟傅匪和中央社所宣称的“空室清野”完全相反，农民们尽一切努力帮助着解放军。一天夜里，部队在绥南山地中摸索前进。我们正为漆黑的天气所苦恼。突然，前面出现了一点微弱的灯光，越来越近，记者隐约地看见一个人影，猜想一定是一个壮健的农民为解放军照路了，可是，当那人影把灯拨了一下，灯光亮起了来，我看清楚了，那是一个年老的农妇。她不断亲切地招呼战士们：“向北走！同志们，一条大路到归绥！”
    绥远农村中狗很多，农民们用来提防傅匪夜间突然围村抓丁抢粮的。这次进军前战士们都以此告诫我要小心防范。可是，一路上我和同我一起走的战士们，没有一个人被狗咬着，原来农民们见解放军来，就都把狗拴起来了。
    一天，在凉城的阳坡窑子村，记者看见一个白发老姆攀着一个解放军战士的衣襟问他：“王班长来没来？”“哪个王班长？”“大个子，长方脸，今年二十岁。今年春天在我家里住过，帮我担水、扫院可勤快咧！”战士笑了，他代那位王班长谢了谢老人家的怀念。
    记者在沿路村庄中，经常看见断腿残臂的农民。他们或是被傅匪打断，或是怕傅匪抓丁而自残的。许多老汉和妇女向记者哭诉他们的儿子被傅匪抓去的情形，和因逃跑被傅匪抓回去活埋的事件。还不知有多少青年已被傅匪暗杀，而父母一直在盼望着他们的儿子归来呢！
    沿路村庄的土墙上，到处写着傅匪的标语：“不空室清野者杀！”“不通情报者杀！”“以物资供敌者杀！”“隐藏敌探者杀！”“通匪者杀！”数不尽的“杀”，“杀气腾腾”——这就是傅匪所吹嘘的其统治区内“秩序安定”的真象。傅作义匪帮的敌人是这么多，以致标语中尽是“敌”、“匪”，这些“敌”、“匪”不是别的，就是绥远人民。
    现在，解放军的宣传队，正到处洗去傅匪的“杀”字标语，改写上：“凡不持枪抵抗本军之敌方人员，本军一律不加俘虏逮捕。”
