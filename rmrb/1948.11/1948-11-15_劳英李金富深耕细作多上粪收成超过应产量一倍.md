　　【Taihang News】Labor hero Li Jinfu from Pingcheng, Lingchuan, achieved a harvest this year that more than doubled the expected yield through deep plowing, intensive farming, and applying more manure. The government rewarded his diligence and did not increase his burden. Li Jinfu, now the Party Branch Secretary of Nanjie, is very active in his work and is fifty-one years old this year. He was elected as a labor hero as soon as the democratic government arrived. The quality of the land he cultivates is no better than others, yet he harvests more grain from his land every year. This year's harvest is also a good one. The newly measured land, about fifteen mu and eight fen, yielded forty shi of grain, more than double the expected yield.
    On the morning of October 20th in the Gregorian calendar, he came to the district office and happily talked about his good harvest this year.
    He said: "I'm not afraid of bearing burdens, I'm just afraid of not moving. I have four and a half mu of land that is the worst. When I bought the land early on, others said I was truly blind. It's a hillside with wild bushes, four and a half mu, not producing grain, possibly delaying work. In the past, the four and a half mu yielded only two or three shi of grain each year. After I turned over, I made it into two plots. When assessing the burden, everyone agreed that the maximum yield per mu of that land was seven dou. This year, my four and a half mu yielded eleven shi and five dou of grain. Others said, you dare not report the truth. I said, more grain is produced with more labor and manure, and the government will not increase the burden. One plot of my land yields one shi and eight dou per mu, four mu and two fen; another plot yields one shi and six dou per mu, three mu and six fen; another plot yields one shi and five dou per mu, three mu and four fen. In total, fifteen mu and seven fen of land were assessed at a yield of twenty-one shi and five dou. This year, I harvested a total of more than forty shi of grain."
    He said: "Growing crops all depends on applying more manure. This year, I applied a total of three hundred and twenty-four dan of grass manure. I fertilized most of the crops once. For my millet fields, after hoeing twice, I applied fertilizer along the roots of the millet, taking great care to prevent the manure from flowing to the side."
    He added: "Farming requires diligent effort. Last autumn, all my land was autumn-plowed. This spring, my wife and two daughters completely hoed the land again. After planting, I cultivated the land evenly, so the millet grew without weeds. This year, I hoed all kinds of crops three times."
    "Even that piece of land with a yield of one shi and eight dou per mu, insects appeared in the middle, and I didn't figure out a good way to treat it, so the grain yield was lower. Otherwise, my grain yield would have been even higher."
    Finally, he said: "My wife is also very capable of labor. She is in the fields all the time. Sometimes, when I have to go to the village to work, she always tells me not to delay the work. If she has nothing to do, she always tells me to go to the fields." (Yue Tianyun, Hou Yaohua)

　　劳英李金富深耕细作多上粪收成超过应产量一倍
    【太行讯】陵川平城劳动英雄李金富深耕细作多上粪的结果，今年的收成超过应产量一倍，政府奖励勤劳并不叫他多出负担。李金富，现在南街的支部书记，工作很积极，今年五十一岁了，民主政府一来他就被选成劳动英雄。他种的地，并不比别人的质量好，年年数他地打的粮食多。今年又是好收成，新丈地好孬十五亩八分，收粮市斗四十石，超过应产量一倍。
    阳历十月二十日早上，他来到区署。高兴地谈了谈他今年的好收成。
    他说：不怕出负担，就怕不动弹。我有四亩半地最不好啦，在早买地的时候，别人说我真瞎了眼，山坡野圪条，四亩五，不打粮食，可能误了工。过去四亩半地年年收二石多、三石粮食，我翻身后把它做成两圪条，评负担时大家公议那地每亩产量最多七斗，今年我四亩半地市斗收了十一石五斗粮食。别人说，你可不敢实报，我说，加工、上粪多打粮食，政府不会加负担的。我种的地石八产量一处，四亩二分；石六产量一处，三亩六分；石五产量一处，三亩四分。一共十五亩七分地，评产量二十一石五斗，我今年共收粮市斗四十多石。
    他说：种地全凭多上粪，今年我一共上了三百二十四担茅粪，大部庄稼我都奶过一遍。我的谷地，是在拉过二遍以后溜着谷根上追粪，粪没流到一边，吃了很大劲。
    又说：种地要得勤造做。去年秋天我的地都秋耕过，今春我老婆和两个闺女又把地完全镢过一遍。种上后我把地整务的平平的，谷上来不芦心。今年各样庄稼我都锄过三遍。
    就是那块一石八斗产量的地，中间生了虫，没研究好治法，少打了粮食，不然我的粮食还要打的多哩。
    最后他说：我老婆也很能劳动，成天上地，有时我要到村办公，她总嘱咐我不要误了活，没事她就叫我到地动弹。　　　　　　（岳天云、侯耀华）
