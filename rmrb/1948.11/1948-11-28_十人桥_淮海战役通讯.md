　　Ten-Man Bridge
  　Communication from the Huaihai Campaign
    Liming

    West of Yantou Town (eighty li northwest of Suqian), the large river flowed swiftly. Across the river, the enemy was burning fiercely illuminating firewood. Across the three-zhang-wide water surface were arranged ten steel helmets, with an irregular wooden bridge built on top of them. Across the bridge, the People's Liberation Army was rapidly advancing to attack the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on the east bank.

    This was a large bridge supported by human bodies, created by the warriors of the Third Platoon of the Second Company of the "Weixian Regiment" of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army.

    After nearly a hundred li of forced march, the "Weixian Regiment" arrived in the vicinity of Yantou Town, where the rushing river blocked their path. Surrounded in the Yantou Town area were troops of the 63rd Army of Chiang Kai-shek's Huang Baitao Corps. The Second Company was ordered to launch an attack on Yantou Town.

    Under the enemy's desperate shooting blockade, the company commander ordered the Third Platoon to resolutely complete the bridge construction. Platoon Leader Ma of the Third Platoon, who was participating in the battle despite being ill, immediately led soldiers Pan Fuquan and Yang Yuai into the rapid current. Overcoming numerous difficulties, they finally used two wooden ladders to build an unstable pontoon bridge. But the enemy's firepower continued to fire densely. At this critical moment, Deputy Platoon Leader Fan Xuefu of the First Platoon called out: "If there are no bridge piers, we'll be the bridge piers!"

    "Okay!" The warriors of the First Platoon responded in unison and quickly jumped into the rapid current. When soldiers Pan Fuquan and Yang Yuai saw that supporting the bridge with their arms was too high, they placed one leg in the water and used the other leg to support the bridge. When soldier Sun Shuzan saw that the ladder was uneven, he immediately used both hands to level the ladder. Deputy Platoon Leader Fan and soldier Song Xiegui stood in the deepest part of the water to lift the bridge. A human-supported bridge was successfully built! They shouted to the assault team on the shore: "Cross boldly, comrades!" "Cross! We guarantee your safety."

    The attacking units, the First Company, Second Company, Third Company, and Machine Gun Company, quickly passed in succession. Some soldiers slipped and fell on the heads of the bridge-supporting men, who used their heads to hold them up and allow them to climb up. Someone stepped on Song Xiegui's neck, and Song stubbornly held his neck so that his comrade could pass safely. When soldier Lu Yuchai of the Third Company fell into the river, Song Xiegui asked Deputy Platoon Leader Fan to support both ends of the bridge alone while he rescued Lu Yuchai. While supporting the bridge, soldier Sun Kepan also used one hand to pull up comrades who had fallen into the water. The November cold current chilled their flesh and bones. As time went on, the bridge-building warriors' teeth chattered, the bridge body trembled constantly, and the bridge deck gradually lowered. Communist Party member Song Xiegui then said to everyone: "Close your mouths, clench your teeth, straighten your backs, and complete the mission!" Deputy Platoon Leader Fan also called on everyone: "Cheer up and let the whole battalion pass!" Comrade Song Xiegui loudly sang his favorite song: "The field army fears nothing, hardships and difficulties cannot scare us… We are not afraid of water reaching our waists, we can withstand it no matter how deep or large it is…” The singing inspired the warriors of the entire platoon. The slogans "Cheer up and resolutely complete the mission!" constantly came from the water. When First Company soldier Chen Guanghua passed the bridge, he discovered that Pan Fuquan, a soldier who had been promoted with him, was supporting the bridge in the water. “How are you, Lao Pan?” Pan Fuquan immediately recognized Xiao Chen's voice and replied: "Lift hard, let's have a challenge competition."

    The entire battalion, stepping on the bridge built by the warriors of the Third Platoon, victoriously crossed to the other side and, in coordination with fraternal units, annihilated the enemy in Yantou Town.

　　十人桥
  　淮海战役通讯
    黎明
    堰头镇（宿迁西北八十里）西面的大河湍急地流着。河对岸的敌人正燃烧着熊熊的照明柴。三丈宽的水面上排列着十顶钢盔，中间架着一座不整齐的木桥，桥上正迅速地通过着向河东蒋匪军进攻的解放军。
    这是一条由人的身体支撑着的大桥，是解放军某部“潍县团”二连三班勇士们的创造。
    “潍县团”经过近百里的长途迫击，到达堰头镇近郊时，这条急流的大河挡住了追路。被包围在堰头镇一带的，是蒋匪黄伯韬兵团六十三军的部队。二连受命向堰头镇发起攻击。
    在敌人拼命地射击封锁下，连长命令三班坚决完成架桥。带病参战的三班马班长受命后，立即率领战士潘福全、杨玉艾跳到急流里，克服重重困难，终于用两架木梯架起一座不稳固的浮桥。但敌人的火力继续绵密地射击着。在这紧急关头，一排排副范学福号召道：“没有桥腿，我们当桥腿！”
    “行！”一排的勇士们一致响应，并迅速跳下急流。战士潘福全、杨玉艾看见用臂膀抬桥太高了，就一腿踏在水里，一腿支桥。战士孙树赞一看梯子不平，即用双手把梯子抬平。范排副和战士宋协国立在水的最深处抬桥。一座人架的大桥成功了！他们便向岸边的突击队员们喊着：“大胆地过吧，同志们！”“过吧！我们保险。”
    进攻部队一连、二连、三连、机枪连迅速依次地通过。有的战士滑倒在架桥的人的头上，他们就使劲用头顶住，让滑倒的爬起来。不知是谁踩住宋协国的脖子，宋就硬挺着脖子那个战友安全通过。三连的战士鲁玉柴掉在河里，宋协国就叫范排副一个人抬着两个桥头，自己去救起鲁玉柴。战士孙克潘一面抬桥，一面还用一只手拉着掉在水里的同志。十一月的寒流，浸冷他们的肉骨。随着时间的延长，架桥勇士们的牙齿格格作响，桥身不住的颤抖着，桥板也渐渐的低下来。共产党员宋协国这时向大家说：“闭住嘴，咬紧牙，挺起腰来，完成任务！”范排副也号召大家：“振起精神来，叫全营通过！”宋协国同志响亮地唱起他最爱唱的歌：“野战军什么也不怕，艰苦和困难吓不倒咱………不怕水深来到腰，再深再大也抗得了………”歌声鼓舞了全班的勇士。“打起精神，坚决完成任务！”的口号声不断地从水面上传来。当一连战士陈光华通过大桥时，发现和他一起升级的战士潘福全正在水里撑桥囤。“怎么样，老潘？”潘福全立即辨别出是小陈的声音，便回答道：“使劲抬呀，咱们挑战竞赛。”
    全营踏着三班勇士们架的大桥，胜利跨上对岸，配合兄弟部队歼灭了堰头镇的敌人。
