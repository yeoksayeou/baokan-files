Xinhua News Agency, North China, 4th: The Water Conservancy Promotion Society established in Tangxian, Wanxian, Yixian, Mancheng, and Xushui areas of the North Yue region in the North China Liberated Area has achieved considerable success in restoring and developing waterwheels and wells. The Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government attaches great importance to this, considering it one of the most effective ways to improve agricultural production and plans to promote it greatly. In the areas along the Pinghan Railway in Hebei Province, the masses have traditionally used wells and waterwheels for irrigation. However, due to years of devastation by Japanese invaders and Kuomintang bandit troops, the number of waterwheels and wells has significantly decreased. For example, in Shulu County alone, 33% of the waterwheels and 44% of the wells were damaged and have not yet been fully restored. After the land reform, farmers universally demanded more waterwheels to develop production, saying, "Only with waterwheels can we truly turn ourselves around." Therefore, the former Jin-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee established the Water Conservancy Promotion Society in areas such as Tangxian, Wanxian, Yixian, Mancheng, and Xushui counties to gain experience before further promotion. The Society, on the one hand, supports the waterwheel industry, solving difficulties in raw materials, funds, and sales. On the other hand, it combines loans to organize farmers to repair or increase waterwheels and wells. From its establishment on March 15th to July 15th this year, in four months, it has sold and loaned a total of 872 various waterwheels and repaired 4,272 old waterwheels, thus increasing the irrigated area by 129,000 mu.

The Society's preliminary experience in the past six months is as follows: First, it is difficult to achieve results by relying solely on the Promotion Society to develop water conservancy. It must work with local cadres responsible for production to mobilize the masses and also cooperate with other relevant departments (especially trade departments) to solve the problem of raw material supply. Second, to massively promote this type of water conservancy, it is necessary to absorb a large amount of private capital from the masses, allowing farmers of all classes to raise cash to buy waterwheels. Third, waterwheel loans should be given entirely in kind, with a fixed term, and lent and recovered as needed to strengthen the effectiveness of the loans. Fourth, to promote water conservancy, it is necessary to support the waterwheel manufacturing industry. The best way to support is through ordering, because this method can guarantee planned production and promote increased production and improved quality. If loans are simply given, the effect on improving production will not be great. Direct investment, while easier to control production plans, has capital that is too fixed and difficult to circulate. Fifth, while supporting the waterwheel manufacturing industry, it is also necessary to support the iron and woodworking industries. While promoting well-digging among farmers, it is also necessary to support brick kilns. Only in this way can work be carried out smoothly. Sixth, in developing water conservancy, attention must also be paid to solving the lack of fertilizer and livestock after dry land is converted to paddy fields. For example, after Baijiazhuang in Wanxian County added waterwheels, the county production promotion society loaned 500,000 Jibi to support an oil mill, solving the farmers' fertilizer difficulties.

It is generally estimated that dry land can increase production by one-third to one time after being converted to paddy fields. The Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government attaches great importance to this, considering it one of the most effective ways for the drought-prone North China rural areas to overcome natural disasters and increase production. The Department has now sent people to investigate the specific situation in various regions and plans to establish water conservancy promotion societies in areas with conditions for promotion next spring to restore and develop waterwheels and wells. The Department also suggests that agricultural departments, trade departments, production promotion societies, cooperatives, etc., at all levels cooperate with the water conservancy promotion societies to promote this cause universally in next year's great production movement.

　　恢复与发展水车水井扩大浇地
  　水利推进社取得经验
    农业部已派人调查准备推广
    【新华社华北四日电】华北解放区在北岳区的唐县、完县、易县、满城、徐水一带创建的水利推进社，在恢复与发展水车水井事业上已获得相当成绩。华北人民政府农业部对此极为重视，认为这是把农业生产提高一寸的最有效的办法之一，准备大大提倡。河北省平汉沿线地区，群众历来是用打水井安水车办法浇地，但若干地区因连年遭受日寇及国民党匪军摧残破坏，水车水井大量减少，如束鹿一县水车即坏了百分之三十三，水井坏了百分之四十四，至今尚未完全恢复。土地改革后，农民普遍要求增加水车，发展生产，都说：“安上水车才能翻透身。”因此，前晋察冀边区行政委员会即在唐县、完县、易县、满城、徐水等县一带创办水利推进社，准备取得经验，再行推广。该社一面扶助水车业，解决其原料、资金、销售等困难，一面结合贷款，组织农民修理或增加水车水井。自今年三月十五日成立起，至七月十五日止，四个月中，共已售出及贷出各种水车八百七十二辆，修理旧水车四千二百七十二辆，因而增加了水浇地面积十二万九千亩。
    半年来该社的初步经验如下：第一，单靠推进社来发展水利是不易收效的，必须与当地负责生产工作的干部一道，动员群众，同时也要结合其他有关部门（尤其是贸易部门）解决原料供给问题。第二，要大量推广这种水利事业，必须吸收群众中的大批私资，让各阶层农民凑集现款购买水车。第三，水车贷款应完全贷给实物，且应有期限，随收随贷，以加强贷款实效。第四，要推进水利事业，必须扶助水车制造业，扶助的方法，以订货方式为最好，因为这种方式能保证有计划的生产，并对增产及提高质量上均有推动作用。如果单纯给予贷款，则对改进生产作用不大；而直接投资虽易掌握生产计划，但资金太固定，不易周转。第五，在扶植水车制造业同时，还须扶植铁木工业。与推动农民打井同时，又必须扶植砖窑。如此才能顺利开展工作。第六，在发展水利中，同时必须注意解决旱地变为水地后肥料牲口等的缺乏问题。如完县白家庄添了水车后，县生产推进社即贷出冀钞五十万元扶助油坊一座，解决了农民的肥料困难。
    一般估计，旱地变为水地后，可增产三分之一以至一倍。华北人民政府农业部对此极为重视，认为这是多旱的华北农村战胜天灾和增产的最有效的办法之一。现该部已派人调查各地具体情况，准备明春在具有推广条件的地区成立水利推进社，恢复与发展水车和水井。该部还建议各级农业部门、贸易部门、生产推进社、合作社等与水利推进社合作，使这种事业在明年大生产运动中普遍展开。
