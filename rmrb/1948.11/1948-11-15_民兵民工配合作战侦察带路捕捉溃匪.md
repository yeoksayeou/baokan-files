[Jinzhong Electric] The militia and laborers in the newly liberated and old areas participating in the Taiyuan Campaign actively cooperated with the People's Liberation Army in combat, reconnaissance, guiding the way, capturing fleeing bandits, and collecting weapons. When the People's Liberation Army attacked Taiyuan, the militia working team of the First District of Yuci (near Taiyuan) bravely blocked the Fourth Company of the Ninth Regiment of the Yan Xishan bandits stationed at Longwang Mountain on October 7th. The enemy was unable to withstand the attack and fled. The next day, taking advantage of the enemy's panic, the working team, under the cover of machine guns, bravely charged the bunker led by Guo Xier, the squad leader of the fourth squad. Seeing the fierce attack, the enemy fled in panic. The three bunkers of the bandit army at Longwang Mountain were occupied by the militia, killing and wounding four enemies, capturing one, seizing eleven boxes of shells, more than thirty bags of flour, and many landmines and grenades. Soon after, a company of the bandit "Struggle Regiment" stationed at Jijia Mountain, hearing the news, feared our army's attack and fled in a hurry. In Xiaoxigou and other villages in Yuci, which were newly liberated in Taiyuan, the masses voluntarily led the way and scouted the terrain as soon as the People's Liberation Army arrived. Si Huaier, a farmer in the village, led the troops to a bandit bunker, explaining in detail the appearance of the bandit fortifications and what kind of mines were buried around it, and personally removed the mines, greatly contributing to the army's actions. Yin Fugen, the village head of Chejia＠ village, went to the coal kiln next to the village to mine coal and encountered six fleeing Yan Xishan bandits. He vigilantly said, "There are many People's Liberation Army soldiers here. Taiyuan is tightly surrounded on all sides. Why don't you surrender?" He also explained the lenient policy of the People's Liberation Army. The six fleeing bandits then took a machine gun and four rifles and followed Yin Fugen back to the village to surrender to the People's Liberation Army. Zhang Fulin and Shang Mao Hai, communication officers of the Taihang old area Licheng Labor Support Detachment, went to the front line to deliver letters. On their way back, they encountered a vanguard platoon of the Independent Eighth Regiment of the Yan Xishan bandits. The bandits forced them to lead the way to Taiyuan. In a dangerous situation where they were outnumbered, Shang Mao Hai secretly hid the letter in his shoes and walked in front, pretending to lead the way. Zhang Fulin, who was walking behind, promoted the lenient policy of our army to the Yan Xishan bandits and persuaded three Yan Xishan bandits to carry three rifles and more than a hundred bullets and escape with him to our side. The remaining bandit soldiers were led by Shang Mao Hai to our army's position and became prisoners. In the Fengge Liang battle, the Meng County Labor Five Company braved fierce artillery fire to not only rescue thirty-seven wounded soldiers, but also cooperated with the troops to seize nine enemy rifles, one small cannon, three grenade launchers, five grenades, and one hundred and fifty rounds of ammunition.
