To the Editor:

We received the Party newspaper's criticism of us on October 25th today. After studying it, we believe the criticism is very accurate. The Prefectural Committee is responsible for the inadequate effort in the Handan rectification work. We failed to pay enough attention to and urge the Handan County Committee to conduct a serious self-examination regarding the Party newspaper's criticism of them. This was our mistake. In particular, the letter from readers in Handan calling for rectification, forwarded by the Party newspaper, was not submitted to the Prefectural Committee for study by the office because we were busy summarizing the land reform and Party consolidation work for the first half of the year. This led to a failure to promptly investigate and respond to the Handan issue, and this negligence and delay was an even greater error. We sincerely accept the criticism from the Party newspaper. Such a liberal attitude of failing to seriously examine the work in Handan and failing to pay attention to the Party newspaper's criticism shows that we have not been earnest enough in implementing the Party's policies, and this should be deeply examined and quickly corrected.

However, before this, and even when the second letter arrived, that is, when the Xin Dazhong Daily published its opinions on Handan, we began to pay attention to this issue. On October 9th, the Prefectural Committee sent an investigation team led by Comrade Zhao Shaozhou to Handan to investigate and ordered the Handan County Committee to conduct a deep self-criticism. The investigation team returned to the office on the 22nd. After studying the materials brought back from the investigation, we believe that the Party newspaper's reports and criticisms of the situation in Handan are basically correct. After the Prefectural Committee issued instructions on rectifying errors in Handan in May, the County Committee conducted a period of rectification work, but stopped due to erroneous thoughts such as "fear of chaos." As a result, the mule that was supposed to be compensated to Han the carpenter in Nan Su Cao was taken back, and the fruits stored in many villages were not distributed. The reader's letter stating that Zheng San of Bei Su Cao was paraded through the streets and Lu Shoushan of Lai Ma Tai was tied up are all facts. The Handan County Committee should conduct a strict investigation and publicly admit their mistakes in the Party newspaper. The previous self-criticism of Handan was extremely superficial. We are urging the Handan leading organs to conduct a deep self-criticism of the Party newspaper's criticism. The Prefectural Committee is also preparing to send people again to conduct a deeper and more comprehensive investigation in order to quickly resolve the Handan issue. After the investigation, we will send the complete and true situation, as well as the Handan County Committee's self-criticism, to you and the Xin Dazhong Daily for publication. Receiving the opinion today asking us to examine and respond to the Handan issue is a spur to us and is of great help to our work. We will definitely send you and the Xin Dazhong Daily the results of the investigation into the rectification of errors in the rural areas of Handan and the self-criticism of the Handan County Committee in the near future.

　　关于邯郸县纠偏问题
  　冀南三地委检讨答复
    已派人进行调查并督促县委检讨编辑同志：
    十月二十五日党报对我们的批评，今天见到了。经研究之后，我们认为对我们批评得很对。邯郸纠偏工作未认真进行，地委会是有责任的。党报对邯郸县委提出批评，我们未能重视并督促他们认真检查，这是我们的不对。尤其党报转来邯郸读者呼吁纠偏的信，因当时正在忙于总结上半年土改整党工作，办公室将信接着后未提交地委会研究，致未能及时将邯郸问题检查答复，这种疏忽拖延更是错误的。我们诚恳接受党报的批评。象这样对邯郸工作未认真检查，对党报批评不重视的自由主义的态度是说明我们贯彻党的政策还不够认真，这是应该深刻检讨迅速纠正的。
    不过在这以前及至第二封信来时，即当新大众报发表了对邯郸意见之时，我们对此问题已开始重视起来。地委于十月九日派调查组赵绍周等同志赴邯郸检查，并令邯郸县委作深刻的检讨。调查组是二十二号返回机关，我们当研究了检查来的材料之后，认为党报对邯郸情况的报导与批评意见基本上是正确的。邯郸县当地委五月作了纠偏指示后，曾作了一段纠偏工作，但由于“怕乱”等错误思想，就停下来，以至南苏曹将补偿给韩木匠的骡子又牵回来及许多村果实封存未分，读者来信说北苏曹郑三游街及来马台卢寿山被捆等都是实事，应该由邯郸县委进行严格的检查，并在党报上公开承认错误。上次邯郸的检讨极不深刻，我们已在督促邯郸领导机关对党报批评作深刻检讨。地委并准备再派人去作较深刻全面的检查，以便对邯郸问题的迅速解决。待检查后再将全部真实情况答复新大众及人民日报。今天接到要我们对邯郸问题检查答复的意见，这对我们是个督促，对我们的工作有很大帮助。我们于最近一定将调查邯郸农村纠偏的结果，以及邯郸县委会的自我检讨送给你们及新大众发表。
  　　　　　　　冀南三地委
  　　　十一月一日
