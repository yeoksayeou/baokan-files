Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Reports from various sources: The Far East International Military Tribunal's trial of 25 major Japanese war criminals, which had been delayed for two and a half years under the demands and urging of the people of the world, has announced its verdict. From the 4th to the 12th of this month, the court read out a 1,136-page judgment. The judgment pointed out that Japan's 90-year history was a period of continuous acts of aggression, confirmed that Japan was guilty of launching wars of aggression against China and similar wars against the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and other Allied countries, and declared that all 25 Japanese wartime leaders on trial for war crimes were guilty. In mentioning Japan's invasion of China, it considered the "September 18th Incident" as the fuse of World War II. Matsui Iwane, Mutō Akira, Hirota Kōki, Minami Jiro, Umezu Yoshijiro, and Kaya Okinori, among others, were held responsible for the brutal event in world history, the massacre of 200,000 Chinese people within six weeks after the Japanese army occupied Nanjing. The judgment showed a contradictory attitude to the aforementioned arguments regarding the handling of Emperor Hirohito and some major war criminals who should be held responsible for the war. The judgment actually said that Hirohito did not agree with the plan to invade China in order to exonerate Hirohito from war crimes. Seven war criminals were sentenced to death by hanging, but some other notorious war criminals were not sentenced to the death penalty. According to the final verdict: those sentenced to death by hanging were former head of the Manchurian Special Agency Doihara Kenji, former Prime Minister and Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army Tojo Hideki, former Minister of the Army and Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army Itagaki Seishiro, proponent of the "Hirota Three Principles" and former Prime Minister Hirota Koki, head of the Nanjing Massacre Matsui Iwane, former Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Army Ministry of the Tojo Cabinet Muto Akira, and former Vice-Minister of the Army Ministry of the Tojo Cabinet Kimura Heitaro; those sentenced to life imprisonment included former Minister of the Army and instigator of the "January 28th" war of aggression against China Araki Sadao, former Prime Minister and Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army Koiso Kuniaki, former Prime Minister and head of the Japanese fascist group "Kokuhonsha" Hiranuma Kiichiro, former Commander of the Kwantung Army and Chief of the General Staff who signed the He-Umezu Agreement Umezu Yoshijiro, former Commander of the Kwantung Army Minami Jiro, former Commander of the China Expeditionary Army ＠ Shunroku who implemented the Japanese army's Three Alls Policy, former Minister of the Navy Shimada Shigetaro, former Minister of the Imperial Household Kido Koichi, former Chief Secretary of the Tojo Cabinet and Chief of General Affairs of the puppet Manchukuo Hoshino Naoki, former Minister of Finance and President of the North China Development Company Kaya Okinori, former President of the Planning Board of the Tojo Cabinet Suzuki Teiichi, former Ambassador to Germany Oshima Hiroshi, former Ambassador to Italy Shiratori Toshio, former Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Army Ministry of the Tojo Cabinet Sato Kenryo, former Director of the Naval Affairs Bureau of the Naval Ministry of the Tojo Cabinet Tomioka Sadatoshi, leader of the Japanese fascist "Young Officers" and participant in the Nanjing Massacre Hashimoto Kingoro, etc., totaling sixteen people; former Minister of Foreign Affairs and Ambassador to the Soviet Union of the Tojo Cabinet Togo Shigenori was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment; former Minister of Foreign Affairs and Ambassador to the puppet Nanjing government Shigemitsu Mamoru, who presided over the Shanghai Truce Agreement, was sentenced to 7 years of imprisonment.
