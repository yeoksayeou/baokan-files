　　From the Huaihai Front, Xinhua News Agency, November 21st: A frontline reporter reports on the annihilation of Sun Liangcheng's enemy unit, the 107th Army, in Suining, stating: The enemy's 107th Army headquarters and its affiliated 260th Division, located in Suining City, southeast of Xuzhou, hastily fled Suining City towards Xuzhou on the 12th, under the pressure of our advancing frontline forces. As the fleeing enemy reached the vicinity of Gaoji, west of Suining City, they were immediately intercepted by our local armed forces of the Jianghuai region. The fleeing enemy attempted to break through several times, but to no avail. By midnight on the 12th, a unit of the rapidly advancing People's Liberation Army had completely surrounded the enemy in the area of Xingweizi and Dawangji, northwest of Suining. As the People's Liberation Army completed all attack deployments and various caliber artillery pieces were ready to bombard, our frontline command ordered the besieged and about-to-be-annihilated enemy to lay down their arms completely before 11:30 AM on the 13th, to avoid unnecessary sacrifice. After the order was issued, Sun Liangcheng, the army commander of the 107th Army, personally went to our frontline command, expressing his willingness to lay down arms and personally signing the order for his subordinates to lay down arms. When this news spread, the soldiers of the 107th Army immediately ran to the positions of the People's Liberation Army, inquiring about the victory news of the People's Liberation Army. At noon on the same day, the army headquarters, the army's directly subordinate special service battalion, engineer battalion, motor vehicle detachment, etc., and all more than 5,000 officers and soldiers of the 260th Division, laid down various light and heavy weapons, vehicles, and engineering equipment in an orderly manner according to the designated positions. After all the weapons were handed over, they each gathered in the large square outside the village, carrying their personal belongings. All the officers and soldiers of the army who laid down their weapons received generous treatment from the People's Liberation Army. The 261st Division of the army, which had fled earlier, was annihilated by another unit of our People's Liberation Army when it fled to the Guanyintang and Chenqiao area, forty li southeast of Xuzhou, on the morning of the 14th. Thus, Sun Liangcheng's 107th Army was completely destroyed.

　　睢宁敌孙良诚部
  　一零七军覆没经过
    【新华社淮海前线二十一日电】前线记者报导睢宁之敌孙良诚部一零七军覆没经过称：敌在徐州东南睢宁城之一零七军军部及所属之二六零师，在我前线大军进逼下，于十二日仓惶自睢宁城向徐州逃逸。该敌于逃至睢宁城西之高集附近时，即为我江淮地方武装当头截住。逃敌曾几度夺路，均归无效。于十二日午夜，神速急进的解放军某部即将该敌全部包围于睢宁西北之邢圩子、大王集一带。当解放军一切攻击布署停当，各种口径大炮待命轰炸时，我前线指挥所乃限令被围待歼之敌，于十三日上午十一时半以前全部放下武器，免遭无谓牺牲。命令发出后，该军军长孙良诚乃亲至我前线指挥所，表示愿意放下武器、并亲自签署了令所属放下武器的命令。当此项消息传出后，一零七军的士兵们立刻跑到了解放军的阵地上来，询问人民解放军的胜利消息。是日正午，该军军部、军直属特务营、工兵营、汽车大队等及二六零师全部五千余官兵，按照指定位置有秩序地放下了各种轻重武器、车辆和工兵器材。全部缴械完毕后，他们各自带着私人所有的行装，分头集合在圩外大广场上。该军所有放下武器的官兵均受到解放军宽大待遇。其先行逃窜的该军二六一师，则于十四日上午逃至徐州东南四十华里的观音堂、陈桥一带时，被我另部解放军歼灭。至此，孙良诚部一零七军即告覆灭。
