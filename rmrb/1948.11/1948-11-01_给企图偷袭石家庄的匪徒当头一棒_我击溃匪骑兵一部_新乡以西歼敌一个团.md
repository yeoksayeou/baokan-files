The Fu bandits' 94th Army, 121st Division, 5th Division, the New 2nd Army's Provisional 32nd Division, and the bandit E You San's reorganized 12th Cavalry Brigade, along with Liu Chunfang's New 4th Cavalry Division, advanced south from Baoding on the 28th and reached the Ding County area on the 30th. Their vanguard, bandit E You San's cavalry unit, crossed the Tang River in the area between Ding County and Anguo on the afternoon of the 29th and was immediately surrounded and defeated by our troops. The remnants fled in a northeasterly direction. The Fu bandits engaged in burning, killing, and looting wherever they went, behaving with extreme cruelty. The people along the Baoding-Shijiazhuang line and on both sides are now rising up to kill the enemy. Militia and guerrilla units in more than ten counties have now been mobilized to actively cooperate with the regular army in combat.
