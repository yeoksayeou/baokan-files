Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 15th: The massive amounts of money, arms, and material aid from US imperialism cannot save Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule from its ultimate demise.

According to revised statistics based on available materials, the United States provided Chiang Kai-shek with a total of $4,346,600,000 in monetary, material, and service assistance after Japan's surrender. This includes: (1) Five loans totaling $144,420,000. These include successive cotton loans of $67 million, a $15 million loan to improve seaports in June 1946, a $16.5 million ship loan in April 1947, a relief loan of $27.7 million under the Chiang-American "Relief Agreement" in October of the same year, and $18 million in "Temporary Aid" passed by the US Congress in December of the same year. (2) Nine material and service assistance items totaling $3,802,229,000, namely: $777,663,000 in post-war "Lend-Lease Aid" (Note: This figure was counted as $694 million in the "Preliminary Statistics on US Imperialist Aid to Chiang" published by this agency on March 15th, and is now corrected according to a Washington dispatch from the United States Information Service on March 1st. In addition, the "Defense Assistance" item listed in that statistic is actually this "Lend-Lease Aid", so that item should be deleted.), the cost of Pacific surplus materials sold in August 1946 at $837 million, the cost of aircraft and equipment and training expenses for the "Eighth and One-Third Air Force Program" in June of the same year at $300,775,000, the donation of 271 naval vessels and the estimated value of the sale of surplus US military supplies in China at $800 million (estimated by the US State Department), the transfer of fixed US military equipment in China at $84 million, surplus materials from the India-Burma theater at $500 million, the bargain sale of 130 million bullets in June 1947 at a reduced price of $5,909,931, the US portion of UNRRA relief materials at $485 million, and $5 million in post-UNRRA relief funds donated to the Chiang bandits (most of which was a US donation). The above loans and materials and services total $3,946,649,000. Adding the $400 million in aid to Chiang finally passed by the US Congress on June 19, 1948, US post-war aid for Chiang's civil war totaled $4,346,649,822.23. The assistance used by the US advisory group to train the Chiang army is not included in this amount.

In addition, during the war against Japan, the United States provided the Chiang Kai-shek government with eight loans totaling $697,800,000, plus $870 million in wartime "Lend-Lease Aid" deliveries, for a total of $1,567,800,000. Most of the loans granted by the United States to Chiang Kai-shek during the war of resistance were not used. For example, at the end of 1945, after the end of the war of resistance, the Chiang Kai-shek government still possessed $900 million in foreign exchange reserves, a significant portion of which was unused US financial loans. The vast majority of Lend-Lease materials were also not used in the War of Resistance against Japan. At that time, only Kuomintang troops equipped with American weaponry participated in small-scale wars against the Japanese invaders in the India-Burma theater and western Yunnan. These loans and material assistance were in fact also used for the war of massacring the Chinese people.

The above US aid to the Chiang Kai-shek government, both after and during the War of Resistance, totals $5,914,400,000. This is the enormous investment made by the United States in launching a civil war for Chiang Kai-shek in order to enslave the Chinese people. This is the vast civil war stake that Chiang Kai-shek exchanged for selling out China's land, sea, air, military, political, economic, and cultural sovereignty.

Now, the nationwide civil war has only been going on for two years and four months, and Chiang Kai-shek's stake is exhausted. Even the existence of the small Nanjing court feels precarious. On October 29, Chiang Kai-shek gave a written interview to a reporter from the New York Herald Tribune of the US Republican Party, once again frantically calling on the United States to save his life, "urgently relying on US material and moral assistance." But more than two years of facts have proven that US aid cannot save the Kuomintang reactionaries.

　　美援救不了蒋介石统治的死亡
    给蒋介石的浩大赌本
  　打了两年多就已输光
    【新华社陕北十五日电】美帝国主义的巨量金钱、军火、物资的援助，救不了蒋介石反动统治最后死亡的命运。
    根据现有材料的订正统计，日本投降以后，美国给予蒋介石的金钱、物资及服务援助，共达四十三亿四千六百余万美元。其中包括：（一）贷款五项，共计一亿四千四百二十万美元。计历次棉花贷款六千七百万美元，一九四六年六月改进海港贷款一千五百万美元，一九四七年四月船只贷款一千六百五十万美元，同年十月蒋美“救济协定”救济贷款二千七百七十万美元，同年十二月美国会通过“临时援助”一千八百万美元。（二）物资及服务援助九项，共计三十八亿零二百二十九万余美元，即：战后“租借援助”七亿七千七百六十三万美元（注：此数在本社三月十五日“美帝援蒋初步统计”中计为六亿九千四百万美元，现据美国新闻处三月一日华盛顿电改正。另该统计中所列“防务援助”一项，实即此项“租借援助”，故该项应删。），一九四六年八月让售太平洋剩余物资成本八亿三千七百万美元，同年六月“八又三分之一队空军计划”飞机、装备成本及训练费用三亿零七百七十五万美元，赠予海军舰只二百七十一艘及美军在华剩余军火让售估计价值八亿美元（美国务院估计数字），美军在华固定设备转让八千四百万美元，印缅战场剩余物资五亿美元，一九四七年六月廉售一亿三千万发子弹减价五百九十万九千九百三十一美元，联总救济物资美国部分四亿八千五百万美元，联总结束后赠予蒋匪善后救济经费五百万美元（其中绝大部分为美国赠款）。以上贷款及物资、服务合计共为三十九亿四千六百四十九万余美元。再加上一九四八年六月十九日美国会最后通过之援蒋款项四亿美元，则美国战后对蒋内战援助共为四十三亿四千六百四十九万八千二百二十三美元。而美国顾问团用于训练蒋军的援助尚未计算在内。
    此外，在对日战争时期中，美国给予蒋介石政府的贷款计有八项，共达六亿九千七百八十万美元，再加“租借援助”战时运交部分八亿七千万美元，合计为十五亿六千七百八十万美元。抗战时期美国给予蒋介石的贷款大多数均未使用，例如抗战结束后，一九四五年底蒋介石政府尚拥有外汇基金九亿美元，其中相当大一部分即系未使用的美国财政贷款。租借物资绝大部分亦未用于抗日战争，当时美械装备的国民党军仅在印缅战场及滇西参加了小规模的对日寇的战争。这些贷款及物资援助事实上也是用于屠杀中国人民的战争。
    以上抗战后及抗战中美国对蒋介石政府的援助共达五十九亿一千四百余万美元。这就是美国为了奴役中国人民而对蒋介石发动内战的庞大的投资。这就是蒋介石以出卖中国的地上、水上、空中、军事、政治、经济、文化主权为代价换得的浩大内战赌本。
    现在全国内战才打了两年另四个月，蒋介石的赌本输光了，甚至南京小朝廷的存在也已感到朝不保夕了。蒋介石于十月二十九日对美国共和党的纽约先驱论坛报记者发表书面谈话，再一次的向美国狂呼救命，“迫切依赖美国物资及道义之援助”。但是两年多的事实证明，美援救不了国民党反动派。
