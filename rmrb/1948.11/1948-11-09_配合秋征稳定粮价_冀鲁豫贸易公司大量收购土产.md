　　Coordinating with the Autumn Grain Collection to Stabilize Grain Prices
  　Ji-Lu-Yu Trade Company Massively Purchases Local Products
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Electric Dispatch] To coordinate with the autumn grain collection and stabilize grain prices, the Trade Company has decided to massively purchase local products. With the start of the autumn grain collection, farmers will inevitably bring a large quantity of autumn grain to the market in order to pay their grain quotas. If the government does not provide planned support, grain prices may fluctuate. Therefore, in addition to notifying all state-owned stores to cooperate with major market exchanges and private shops to absorb autumn grain in large quantities, a special order has been issued to Puyang Defengyu Store in the Fourth and Eighth Special Districts to absorb indigo, Xian Zhuang Tongfeng Braid Store to absorb straw hat braids in large quantities, and Lu Da Fur Store to absorb fur in the Second and Seventh Special Districts. This is to help and facilitate farmers in paying their grain quotas. The stores are currently conducting concrete research, discussion, and arrangement.

　　配合秋征稳定粮价
  　冀鲁豫贸易公司大量收购土产
    【冀鲁豫电】为配合秋征，稳定粮价，贸易公司决定大量收购土产。秋征开始，农民为缴纳粮款，一定有大批秋粮涌上市场。政府如不作有计划的支持，粮价可能发生波动。因此除通知各公营商店配合各大集市交易所及私人行店大量吸收秋粮外，并特令濮阳德丰玉商店在四、八专区吸收土靛，仙庄同丰辫庄大量吸收草帽辫，鲁大皮毛庄在二、七专区大量吸收皮毛。以便帮助和便利农民缴纳粮款。现各商店正在具体研究，讨论布置。
