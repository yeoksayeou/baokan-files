On the evening of October 17th, the People's Liberation Army poured into the eastern part of Changchun, taking over the defense areas that the 60th Army had evacuated after their uprising. The enemy's New 7th Army, defending the western part of the city, suddenly noticed the People's Liberation Army appearing from the east under the bright moonlight. Although the People's Liberation Army did not fire a single shot, the entire enemy army was thrown into panic. Clearly, there was only one path left for the enemy – to lay down their arms and surrender. Before long, the enemy's frontline troops began to surrender their weapons automatically. First, it was a squad, then a platoon, and soon after, a company and then a regiment. Many high-ranking officers, watching themselves become mere figureheads, had no choice but to comply with the will of their subordinates.

On the evening of the 17th, a section chief of the People's Liberation Army was inspecting the takeover when he suddenly noticed several people walking over from the enemy's position. He immediately shouted, "What are you doing?" The other side immediately replied, "We are here to invite the People's Liberation Army to collect our weapons." "How many people are there?" One of them said, "A whole regiment. I am the regimental commander. The troops are already assembled, and the brothers are waiting."

On the 18th, a battalion commander of the New 7th Army was preparing to surrender when the regimental commander sent a messenger to summon him. He sternly said, "What is there to summon me for at this time?!" He immediately led his troops directly to the People's Liberation Army to surrender.

The enemy's artillery regiment sent four representatives to negotiate the surrender with the People's Liberation Army. However, not long after they returned, two people hurriedly ran from the enemy's position, requesting to renegotiate, saying that they were old artillerymen from the former New 1st Army and had now been elected by the soldiers as representatives for the negotiation. They said, "Reporting to the comrades of the People's Liberation Army, 'surrender weapons, no fighting' has long been our idea. Now we don't want to be used as surrender gifts by others. We want to directly join the People's Liberation Army." That evening, they gathered forty artillerymen, escorted various heavy cannons and ammunition to the People's Liberation Army's position, and said to the People's Liberation Army soldiers, "If anyone is unwilling to surrender, please order us to bombard them."

With the enemy soldiers and lower and middle-ranking officers surrendering one after another, the number of figurehead officers within the New 7th Army rapidly increased. They rushed in a panic, unanimously heading towards the military headquarters and command headquarters, all asking, "What to do?" In fact, Zheng Dongguo, the highest commander of the defending enemy, was already in contact regarding the surrender. On the afternoon of the 18th, representatives of the New 7th Army went to the People's Liberation Army headquarters to discuss the terms of surrender. They first put forward two guarantees: (1) collective surrender of weapons; (2) no destruction of warehouses and weapons, while requesting the People's Liberation Army: (1) to protect the lives and property of all officers, including Zheng Dongguo; (2) to settle the old, weak, sick, and disabled; (3) to allow those who wish to return home to return home, and to provide jobs for those who wish to work; (4) not to treat them as prisoners of war. The People's Liberation Army granted their requests. Thus, the surrender proceeded more quickly and in a more organized manner. By the evening of the 19th, the New 7th Army had completely surrendered its weapons, and Changchun was completely liberated. On this day, the 19th, the Central Bank building, which served as the headquarters of the New 7th Army, was crowded with Kuomintang military officers and their families and attendants who had surrendered their weapons. This was the place where Zheng Dongguo was said by the Kuomintang's Central News Agency to have "shed the last drop of blood." (Xinhua News Agency, Changchun)

    长春敌军投降速写
    十月十七日晚，解放军源源开入长春城东部，接收六十军起义后撤出的防区。城西守敌新七军在皎洁的月光下发觉了人民解放军突然从东面出现。虽然解放军一枪未放，他们全军上下已惊慌万状。显然，摆在敌人面前的只有一条路——缴械投降。不多久，敌人前沿部队的自动缴枪就开始了。先是一班、一排地缴，不多时便是一营、一团地缴。许多高级军官眼看着自己变成一个光杆，也不得不遵从部下的意志了。

    十七日晚，解放军有一位股长正在视察接防情形，忽然发现有几个人从对面敌人阵地走过来。他马上大声问：“你们干什么的？”对方立即答道：“我们是来请解放军去缴枪的。”“有多少人？”其中的一个说：“一个整团，我就是团长，现在队伍已经集合起来了，弟兄们正在等着哩。”

    十八日，新七军的一个营长正在准备投降时，团长派传令兵来请他。他就厉声地说：“这个时候还有什么可请的！？”立刻带着队伍直接向解放军缴了械。

    敌人的炮兵团里派来了四个代表，向解放军谈判缴械的事。可是当他们回去没一会，敌人阵地里又匆匆跑来两个人，要求重新谈判，说他们是原新一军的老炮手，现在被士兵推举作谈判代表。他们说：“报告解放军同志，缴枪不打，这早是我们的主意。现在我们不愿被别人拿来做投降礼物，我们要直接加入解放军。”是晚，他们就集中了四十名炮兵，押运各种巨炮、弹药到了解放军阵地，并向解放军战士说：“如果谁不愿投降，请你们命令我们开炮轰他。”

    随着守敌士兵与中下级军官的纷纷投降，新七军内的光杆军官就迅速地增多起来了。他们慌乱地不约而同地向军部、司令部跑，大家在问：“怎么办？”其实，这时守敌的最高指挥官郑洞国也已在接洽投降。十八日下午，新七军的代表到解放军指挥部，商议投降条件。他们首先提出两项保证：（一）集体缴枪；（二）不破坏仓库武器，同时要求解放军：（一）保护所有军官的生命财产，包括郑洞国在内；（二）安置老弱残废；（三）愿回家的准许回家，愿工作的给予工作；（四）不当俘虏看待。解放军允许了他们的要求。于是投降便进行得更加迅速和有组织了。到了十九日晚，新七军已全部缴械完毕，长春完全解放。就在十九日这天，在那座作为新七军军部的中央银行大楼里，挤满了缴了械的国民党军军官和他们的家属、随从。这就是国民党中央社所谓郑洞国“流最后一滴血”的地方。                （新华社长春电）
