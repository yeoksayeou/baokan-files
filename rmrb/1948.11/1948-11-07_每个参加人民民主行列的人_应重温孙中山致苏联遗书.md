Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. To commemorate the 31st anniversary of the Soviet Union's October Socialist Revolution of 1917, we are re-publishing Sun Yat-sen's letter to the Soviet Union, mentioned in Comrade Mao Zedong's essay "Unite All Revolutionary Forces in the World to Combat Imperialist Aggression," at the same time as we publish this essay. The great wish expressed by Mr. Sun Yat-sen twenty-three years ago, "I hope that dawn will soon break, at which time the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally, and the two countries will join hands in the great battle for the freedom of the world's oppressed nations to achieve victory," is now increasingly close to being realized. During the Chinese Great Revolution from 1925 to 1927 and during the Anti-Japanese War from 1937 to 1945, China and the Soviet Union had already achieved cooperation in opposing imperialism. Now, because of the rapid development of the People's Liberation War led by the Chinese Communist Party and its increasing proximity to national victory, "dawn will soon break," which will enable the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union to cooperate more closely in opposing imperialist aggression, and the friendship between China and the Soviet Union will be further enhanced than in the past. The Kuomintang left behind by Mr. Sun in his will, however, has been abandoned by the Chinese people because the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government betrayed Mr. Sun's teachings, stood on the side of the imperialist camp, and opposed the Chinese people and China's good friend, the Soviet Union, which Mr. Sun did not foresee. Only those Kuomintang members and the democratic groups they organized who resolutely break with the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government and its various reactionary factions and reactionary elements, resolutely break with the imperialists, harbor no illusions about them, still advocate and implement uniting with the Soviet Union, opposing imperialism, opposing feudalism, opposing bureaucratic capitalism, and participate in the People's Liberation War camp with action, can conform to Mr. Sun's wishes. At this time, revisiting Mr. Sun's will and comprehending Mr. Sun's correct understanding and enthusiastic attitude towards Sino-Soviet friendship is very beneficial for every Chinese person participating in the ranks of people's democracy. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's letter to the Soviet Union is as follows:

　　To the Central Executive Committee of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Dear Comrades:
　　I am suffering from an incurable disease. My thoughts at this time turn to you, to my party, and to the future of my country. You are the leaders of the Union of Free Republics, this Union of Free Republics, is the true legacy of the immortal Lenin to the world of oppressed nations. Refugees under imperialism will use this to defend their freedom and seek liberation from the international system based on ancient slavery, war, and favoritism. I leave behind the Kuomintang, and I hope that the Kuomintang will work together with you in completing its historical task of liberating China and other invaded countries from the imperialist system. Fate has forced me to put down the unfinished business and hand it over to those who are truly my comrades, formed by adhering to the Kuomintang's doctrine and teachings. Therefore, I have instructed the Kuomintang to carry out the work of the national revolutionary movement, so that China can be freed from the shackles of the semi-colonial status imposed on China by imperialism. To achieve this goal, I have ordered the Kuomintang to maintain close ties with you. I firmly believe that your government will continue to provide assistance to our country as before. Dear comrades, as I bid farewell to you at this moment, I would like to express my fervent hope that dawn will soon break, at which time the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally, and the two countries will join hands in the great battle for the freedom of the world's oppressed nations to achieve victory. I wish you peace in brotherly friendship!

### 每个参加人民民主行列的人　应重温孙中山致苏联遗书

　　每个参加人民民主行列的人
  　应重温孙中山致苏联遗书
    【新华社陕北四日电】为了纪念苏联一九一七年十月社会主义革命节的三十一周年，我们在发表毛泽东同志的论文“全世界革命力量团结起来反对帝国主义的侵略”的同时，特将这篇论文中所提到的孙中山先生致苏联的遗书，重加发表。孙中山先生在二十三年前所表示的伟大愿望，“希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利”，现在已日益接近于实现。在一九二五年至一九二七年的中国大革命时期，在一九三七年至一九四五年的抗日战争时期中苏两国已经实现携手合作反对帝国主义。现在，因为中国共产党领导的人民解放战争的迅速发展和日益接近于全国胜利，“不久即将破晓”，将使中苏两大民族更进一步地携手合作，反对帝国主义的侵略，中苏两国的友谊将比过去更加增进。孙先生遗书中所指望的他所留下的国民党，则因南京国民党反动政府背叛孙先生的遗教，站在帝国主义阵线方面，反对中国人民，反对中国的良友苏联，而被中国人民所唾弃，这是孙先生所不及料的。只有和南京国民党反动政府及其各个反动派别和反动分子坚决地决裂和帝国主义者坚决地决裂，对于它们不存任何幻想，仍然主张并实行联合苏联，反对帝国主义，反对封建主义，反对官僚资本主义，并以行动参加到人民解放战争阵营中来的那些国民党人和他们所组织的民主团体，才能符合于孙先生的愿望。在这个时候，重温孙先生的遗书，领会孙先生对于中苏友谊的正确认识和热烈态度，对于每一个参加人民民主行列的中国人，都十分有益。孙中山先生致苏联的遗书如下：苏维埃社会主义共和国大联合中央执行委员会亲爱的同志：
    我在此身患不治之症。我的心念，此时转向于你们，转向于我党及我国的将来。你们是自由的共和国大联合之首领，此自由的共和国大联合，是不朽的列宁遗与被压迫民族的世界的真遗产。帝国主义下的难民，将借此以保卫其自由，从以古代奴役战争偏私为基础之国际制度中谋解放。我遗下的是国民党，我希望国民党在完成其由帝国主义制度解放中国及其他被侵略国之历史的工作中，与你们合力共作。命运使我必须放下未竟之业，移交于被谨守国民党主义与教训而组成我真正同志之人。故我已嘱咐国民党进行民族革命运动之工作，俾中国可免帝国主义加诸中国的半殖民地状况之羁缚。为达此项目的起见，我已命国民党长此与你们提携。我深信你们政府亦必继续前此予我国之援助。亲爱的同志，当此与你们诀别之际，我愿表示我热烈的希望，希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。谨以兄弟之谊祝你们平安！
