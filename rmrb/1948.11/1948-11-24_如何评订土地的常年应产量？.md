How to Evaluate the Normal Annual Yield of Land?
    Huang Zichun

The truthfulness of land yield assessment is the main key to determining the fairness and rationality of the burden on farmers. At present, the agricultural burden in the North China region varies greatly due to the inconsistency of yield assessment in various places and the imbalance of work progress. In terms of the assessment year, some are based on the general level before the War of Resistance against Japan, some are based on the level after the War of Resistance against Japan and before the Japanese surrender, some are based on the yield level of the last two or three years after land reform, and some are based on the equally divided yield at the time of land reform. Those based on the pre-war level, as well as some areas that assessed yields in order to weaken feudal burdens, have set the yields too high. But as far as the current situation is concerned, most villages, due to the selfishness of village cadres, generally set the yields too low.

Due to different natural conditions, the yield assessment is extremely inconsistent. Some are based on the quality of the land, and some are based on the distance of the land from the village. In other aspects such as water lands, some have high yields for river irrigation which saves labor, and some have low yields for well irrigation which requires labor; in terms of calculation units, some use millet as the standard, and some use corn, sorghum, and wheat as the standard; in terms of grain conversion, some use use value or exchange value for conversion; in terms of the calculation of several seasons of crops, some assess one year as one season, or assess as many seasons as are harvested; in terms of operating conditions, some who have abundant labor and apply more fertilizer and plant more have good yields and are assessed higher, while some who lack labor and apply less fertilizer and plant less have poor yields and are assessed lower, and some assess yields differently based on the prosperity or slackness of the environment; in terms of the year's harvest, some are based on the harvest of the years before or during the War of Resistance, and some are based on the harvest of the last two or three years. In short, the basis for setting yields is varied and extremely complex, and coupled with the selfishness of village cadres in some places, the yield assessment is not truthful enough and cannot be balanced. Because the yield assessment is not truthful and unbalanced, it affects the fairness and rationality of the burden on the people of the entire region, and it also hurts the enthusiasm of farmers for production.

Based on the yield assessment materials from various places, I would like to put forward some opinions on how to assess land yields, for everyone's reference and research.

I. When assessing yields, we must base our work on the spirit of encouraging and developing production in our region. This requires us to grasp the following principles in land yield assessment:

    1.  If yields are increased due to deep plowing, careful cultivation, more processing, and more fertilizer application, the yield should not be increased during assessment. This has a great encouraging effect on farmers' prosperity.

    2.  Rewarding the planting of special crops is because we have very few of these crops, or because they are needed for industrial raw materials and need to be developed in large quantities, such as indigo, hemp, and tobacco. If the yield is assessed by converting the price, it will hit the farmers' planting enthusiasm and affect industrial production.

    3.  Take care of some crops that are beneficial to people's livelihood, such as mountain products and fruits. Although these are not our daily necessities, they are a source of income for the people. In order to encourage development, we must take care of them because the annual income of these crops is not fixed.

    4.  According to the current production level conditions, fair and reasonable calculations should be implemented. For example, for yams and vegetables, if calculated according to use value, the yield will inevitably increase. At the same time, the planting area is not very common, so it should be calculated according to the local planting of major grains.

II. How to evaluate the normal annual yield of land?

    1.  The calculation unit for land yield shall be uniformly based on grain. All cultivated land shall be converted to grain based on the normal annual yield of the food crop with the largest planting area in the local area.

    2.  The determination of the normal annual yield can be based on the following conditions:

        a.  The natural conditions of the land are the main basis for yield assessment. Natural conditions include soil quality, water conservancy, wind direction, sunlight, etc. Soil quality refers to the quality of the land, water conservancy refers to whether it can be irrigated, well irrigation or river irrigation, etc., wind direction refers to whether it is prone to wind, and sunlight refers to sunny or shady (mountain land or village root land), etc.

        b.  The operating conditions of local farmers in recent years are also one of the main bases for yield assessment. Simply put, it is about fertilizer application and labor input on the land. During the assessment, we should distinguish between areas with dense population and little land, intensive cultivation, and areas with sparse population and extensive cultivation, based on the actual situation. In terms of operating conditions, we should follow the general operating conditions in recent years, not the operating conditions before the War of Resistance, nor the operating conditions during the most brutal era of the War of Resistance (1941-1943), but the operating conditions of the past four or five years (not the harvest of the year). Currently, the environment in most areas is stable, and this new condition should be added during the yield assessment. In addition, it should also be based on the operating conditions of general farmers, that is, according to the operating conditions of most farmers in the local area. If the harvest is reduced due to laziness in cultivation, less labor, and less fertilizer, it should not be reduced. Poor operation by households without labor can be taken care of in other aspects, but no special treatment should be given in terms of yield (care can be given through tax reduction or exemption. Because yield assessment is a relatively rigid thing, it should not be changed with other conditions, otherwise there will be deviations).

        c.  The standard should be the harvest volume in normal years in the local area. The so-called normal year does not refer to a bumper year with favorable weather, nor does it refer to a poor harvest year with drought, flood, insects, or hail, but refers to a general normal year in the local area that is neither good nor bad.

    3.  Calculation of crop planting: Land planted for more than one season should be registered according to the number of seasons planted, based on local soil quality, water conservancy, climate, labor, and planting habits. The yield should be assessed by converting grain according to its annual average yield. For example, for land with two seasons a year, the yield is the sum of the previous and subsequent seasons; for land with three seasons in two years, the yield is the total yield of three seasons divided by two; for land with five seasons in three years, the yield is the total yield of five seasons divided by three. The rest can be deduced by analogy. Secondly, grain conversion can be stipulated according to the principle of both use value and exchange value of local farmers, that is, how much grain produced by farmers is used for their own consumption according to local customs, and how much is exchanged? How much can the self-use portion be worth a pound of grain, and how much can the exchange portion be worth a pound of grain at the general average price? This method of conversion and calculation is reasonable. The yield of yam and vegetable land is relatively large. In order to encourage production, it should also be calculated according to the normal annual yield of the main grains planted locally.

    4.  For fruit trees, mountain products, mulberry gardens, bamboo gardens, lotus ponds, etc., the determination of the normal annual yield should take into account their bumper harvests, poor harvests, hanging branches, resting branches, and other situations, and be determined according to their average. In order to encourage the planting of fruit trees, calculate 50% of the general market price during the selling season, converted into grain. For reed and reed marshes, because they save labor and fertilizer, calculate the average annual yield according to the local market price converted into grain, without discount. Sandy land planted with willow branches, red jujube branches, should be calculated according to the general grain planted locally.

The above are some opinions on land yield assessment. They may not be completely reasonable. They are put forward for everyone to study, and different opinions can also be discussed.

　　如何评订土地的常年应产量？
    黄子纯
    土地产量订定的真实与否，是决定农民负担公平合理的主要关键。目前华北区的农业负担，由于各地产量评定的不统一，以及工作进度的不平衡，产量评定有很大差别。在评定年度上，有些根据抗战前一般水平，有些根据抗战以后日本投降以前的水平，有些根据土改以后近二三年的产量水平，有些根据土改时的平分产量。凡根据抗战前水平以及有些地区为了削弱封建挤负担而评定的，就有的把产量定高了。但就目前来说，大部村庄因村干部的本位自私，一般的把产量定低的多。
    由于自然条件的不同，产量评定的极不一致，有的依据土地质量好坏，有的根据土地离村远近而评定。其他如水地方面，有的河浇省工定产高，有的井浇费工定产低；在计算单位上，有以谷子作标准，有以玉菱高粱麦子作标准；在粮食的折合上，有以使用价值或交换价值折合的；在几季作物的计算上，有一年按一季或收几季按几季评定的；在经营条件上，有劳力大施肥多种的好而多定产的，有劳力缺施肥少种的坏而少定产的，也有根据环境的繁弛不同而定产的；在年景上，有的按抗战前或抗战期间的年景收成，有的按最近二三年的年景定收成。总之，定产的根据是五花八门，极其复杂，再加上有些地方村干部的本位自私，而产量订定也就不够真实，不能平衡。由于产量订定不真实不平衡，就影响全区人民负担的不公平与不合理，也就刺伤农民对生产的积极性。
    根据各地订产的材料，谨提出几点怎样订定土地产量的意见，供大家参考研究。
    一、在评订产量时，必须根据我区奖励与发展生产的精神，这就要我们在土地产量评订上，掌握下列的几个原则：
    １、如因深耕细作多加工，多施肥，增大产量，评订产量时，不应提高产量，这对农民发家致富有很大鼓励作用。
    ２、奖励种植特殊作物，是因为我们这种作物还很少，或为发展工业作原料，需要大量发展，如蓝靛、麻、烟等，如果评产时按价折合，就会打击农民的栽种，影响工业生产。
    ３、照顾一些有益于人民生计的作物，如山货果木等，这虽非我们日用必需品，但它是人民收入的一笔来源，加以这些作物平年收入不固定，为奖励发展，就必须照顾。
    ４、根据目前生产水平的条件，应实行公平合理的计算。如山药蔬菜，若按使用价值计算，势必提高其产量，同时种植地区不甚普遍，故应按当地种植主要谷物计算。
    二、怎样评订土地常年应产量？
    １、土地产量的计算单位，一律以谷为计算标准，各种耕地均以当地种植面积最多之粮食作物的常年应产量来折谷计算。
    ２、常年应产量的订定，可根据下列几个条件：
    子、土地的自然条件，它是订产的主要根据。自然条件包括土质、水利、风向、阳光等。土质是指地板的好坏，水利是指能否浇水、井浇或河浇等，风向，是说犯风不犯风，阳光是指向阳或背阴，（山地或村根地）等。
    丑、当地近年一般农户的经营条件，也是定产的主要根据之一。简单说，就是对土地的施肥和用工等，评产时应按当地的情况，即应把人稠地窄，精耕细作的地区，与地广人稀，种多薄收的地区按实际加以区别。在经营条件上，应按近年一般的经营情况，不按抗战前的经营条件，也不能按抗战时最残酷时代（一九四一——一九四三年）经营条件，要按近四五年来的经营条件（不是年景的收成）。目前广大地区环境安定，订产时这一新的条件应加进去。此外，还要根据一般农户的经营条件，即按当地大多数农民的经营条件，凡因怠于耕作，少用工少施肥而致减少收获，不应减低；无劳力户经营差，则可从其他方面照顾，在产量上不能特殊（从减免或除免税上照顾。因产量订定是比较硬性的东西，不宜随其他条件而有变更，否则就会出偏差）。
    寅、依当地平常年头下的收获量作标准，所谓平常年头不是指风调雨顺的丰收年，也不是指旱涝虫雹的歉收年，而是指当地不好不坏一般的平常年景而言。
    ３、种植作物的计算，种植一季以上的土地，按当地的土质及水利、气候、劳力等情况及种植习惯，种几季就按几季登记，依其每年平均产量折谷订定。如一年二季的土地，其产量就是前后两季的合计数；二年三季的土地，其产量则是以二除三季的总产量；三年五季的土地，则是以三年除五季的总产量。其余以是类推。其次是粮食折合，可根据当地农户的使用与交换两种价值的原则来规定，即是说农户生产出来的粮食，根据当地一般的习俗自用多少，交换多少，自用部分多少能抵一斤谷，交换部分在一般平均的价格上多少能折谷一斤？这样折合计算是合理的，种植山药蔬菜地产量比较大，为了奖励生产，亦要按当地种植主要谷物之常年应产量来计算。
    ４、果树、山货、桑园、竹园、藕池等，常年应产量的订定，应照顾到他的丰收歉收挂枝歇枝等情况，依其平均数订定。为了奖励种果木树，按出卖季节之一般市价，折谷五成计算。蒲苇、荻地因其省工省肥，依常年平均产量按当地市价折谷计算，不折扣。砂地种植柳条柳杈红荆条者，按种植当地一般谷物计算。
    以上几点土地产量评订的意见，不见得完全合理，提出来供大家研究，有不同的意见还可以讨论。
