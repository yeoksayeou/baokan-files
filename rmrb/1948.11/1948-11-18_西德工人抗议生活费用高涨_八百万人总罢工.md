Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Reports from various sources: To protest the high cost of living, eight million workers and employees in the U.S.-British joint occupation zone of West Germany staged a 24-hour general strike on the 12th. According to the United Press, this is the largest strike in West Germany since the end of the war, and this general strike has brought the recent series of regional strikes in the U.S.-British occupation zone to a climax. Regarding this general strike by German workers, although the U.S. and British military governors claimed that this was "entirely a German affair" (Agence France-Presse), they also issued a special warning stating: "The occupying authorities hope that there will be no demonstrations" (Domei News Agency).

Since the implementation of the so-called "currency reform" in June of this year, prices in West Germany have continued to rise. Recently, due to the actions of Marshall Plan executor Hoffman and others, who are preparing to implement "currency reform" again, resulting in a sharp decline in monetary credit, and the market's goods being heavily manipulated by speculators, prices have risen even further. The gap between prices and wages has therefore widened even further. Buckler, chairman of the Joint Occupation Zone Trade Union Committee, announced that if the German authorities in the Joint Occupation Zone do not meet the workers' demands, the trade union will take new actions. Buckler stated that the primary goal of the trade union is to lower prices and increase the purchasing power of workers.

　　西德工人抗议生活费用高涨
  　八百万人总罢工
    【新华社陕北十六日电】各方报导：为抗议生活费用的高涨，德国西部美英联合占领区之八百万工人雇员于十二日实行二十四小时总罢工。据合众社称，这是战争结束以来西德规模最大的罢工，这一总罢工使美英占领区近来不断发生之区域性罢工达到高涨。对德国工人的这次总罢工，美英军事总督虽一面声称这“完全是德国人的事”（法新社），但同时却提出特别警告称：“占领当局希望不会有任何示威游行”（电通社）。
    自本年六月实行所谓“币改”以来，西德物价即不断上涨。近来，由于马歇尔计划执行人霍夫曼等，准备再度实行“币改”从而造成货币信用急剧下跌，市场物资被投机商大量操纵，物价即更形高涨。物价与工资间之距离从而亦更形扩大，联合占领区职工会委员会主席巴克勒宣布：如果联合占区德国当局不满足工人的要求，则职工会将采取新行动。巴克勒称，职工会的首要目的，是压低物价和增加工人的购买力。
