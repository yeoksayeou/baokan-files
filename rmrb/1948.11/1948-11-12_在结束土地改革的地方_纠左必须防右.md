　　In Areas Concluding Land Reform
  　Correcting "Leftist" Errors Requires Guarding Against "Rightist" Errors
    Recently, in most villages of the old liberated areas, on the basis of the great achievements of land reform in the past two years, work is underway to conclude land reform. Many places have correctly resolved the problems left over from land reform, stabilized and improved the production enthusiasm of people from all strata in rural areas, and achieved results. Although some places have not thoroughly corrected certain "leftist" deviations and errors that were once prevalent in the land reform movement, resulting in some lingering "leftist" remnants in the work of concluding land reform, this phenomenon must continue to be corrected. However, in the old and semi-old liberated areas, the "leftist" deviations and errors in land reform have generally been stopped. Currently, in the work of concluding land reform and resolving the problems left over from past "leftist" errors, that is, in the follow-up work after stopping "leftist" deviations, some places have begun to develop "rightist" deviations or errors, such as the situations in Beiding Village in Yicheng County of the Taiyue District, Wanghua Village in Liaoyang County of the Jiluyu District, and Yutuo Village in Yi County of the Beiyue District. Although this "rightist" tendency has not developed into the current widespread and major danger, it has become the main deviation in individual villages. If it is not quickly corrected, it may become a common and major dangerous tendency. Any "rightist" deviation or error, like "leftist" deviations or errors, is unacceptable. If allowed to develop, it will become a countercurrent, seriously damaging the great achievements already obtained in land reform.

    In order to consolidate and develop the achievements of land reform and correctly conclude the work of land reform, all localities must continue to oppose "leftist" thinking and errors while being highly vigilant against the growth of "rightist" deviations and errors. We must recognize that the characteristic of this current "rightist" tendency is that it deviates from the Party Central Committee's basic policy of relying on poor and lower-middle peasants (including new middle peasants), uniting with middle peasants, confiscating feudal and semi-feudal land and property, and first satisfying the demands of poor and lower-middle peasants. In correcting "leftist" errors, it only one-sidedly focuses on compensating middle peasants and resettling landlords and rich peasants, regardless of the difficulties and opinions of poor and lower-middle peasants. In Beiding Village, Yicheng County, the working personnel forced the poor and lower-middle peasants, who accounted for 70 out of the 193 households in the village, and the 32 middle-peasant households to "return all" the land and property they had been allocated, "regardless of whether there were problems or not," to the 14 households that had been struggled against (11 of whom maintained a middle-peasant standard of living after being struggled against). As a result, 17 liberated peasants were reduced to abject poverty or poor peasants, while one landlord possessed twice the average amount of land, and the nine rich peasants obtained land that was half again as good as the poor peasants'. The fruits of struggle accumulated in the village were neither distributed to the poor peasants nor used to compensate the middle peasants. This is one of the most extreme examples of this "rightist" tendency. In addition, some places have not universally and thoroughly resolved the land problem but are unwilling to continue to earnestly address it. Some places hastily reclassified landlords as rich peasants, or old-style rich peasants as new rich peasants or middle peasants, and returned their feudal property. Some places are unwilling to satisfy the demands of poor and lower-middle peasants while taking care of the interests of middle peasants. Some places, regardless of the specific circumstances, vaguely stipulated that "all original items must be returned" to "households who were wrongly struggled" and forced all new cadres of poor and lower-middle peasant origin to "admit their mistakes." Accompanying these political errors are two forms of organizational errors: one is to abandon leadership in the work of concluding land reform; the other is to exceed the existing organization, not rely on the activists and better elements within the Party and among the masses, detach oneself from the masses, monopolize everything, and implement the so-called "conscious, top-down, forced, unconditional correction of deviations" by means of commandism. In places where such extreme political and organizational erroneous policies are implemented, the basic masses are dispirited, some poor peasants are even forced to flee, while landlords, old rich peasants, and some bad cadres and bad Party members who have been purged and removed from office are elated.

    Where does this "rightist" error come from? There are generally two different types of people who commit this "rightist" error: One type is conscious; they are landlord and rich peasant elements who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, or people with strong landlord and rich peasant ideologies. They actually oppose land reform, do not recognize the necessity of land reform and the great achievements of land reform, and obstruct the thorough implementation of land reform in every possible way. Others are elements who have committed serious selfish, commandist errors by detaching themselves from the masses, and some factionalists. They have been punished in the process of land reform and Party rectification, and perhaps some of these punishments were excessive, causing them to feel wronged and dissatisfied in the land reform. Some of them sympathize with the objects of struggle by the masses without principle and actually become captives of landlords, rich peasants, and truly incorrigible bad elements, obstructing the implementation of the Party's policies in the process of concluding land reform. The other type of people are unconscious; they either have extreme one-sidedness in their thinking, having committed serious "leftist" errors in the past and created many bad consequences, and now have deviated to the "right" after correcting "leftist" errors, or they do not know how to handle matters according to the situation and have indeed encountered difficulties in practical work. For example, in the case of so-called "large holes and small patches," they only know that they must complete the tasks of compensation and resettlement, so they force the masses to return the fruits without regard to the situation. Most of these people are still good comrades within our Party, but because their level of Marxist-Leninist theory is too low, their thinking is extremely one-sided, and the remnants of commandism in their work style have not been eliminated, they vacillate in the implementation of policies and deviations occur.

    Therefore, Party committees at all levels in areas concluding land reform must firmly grasp leadership, both correcting "leftist" errors and preventing "rightist" errors. On the one hand, it is necessary to continue to earnestly resolve the many leftover problems caused by the "leftist" deviations in the past land reform work, especially the handling of issues such as re-determining class status, compensating middle peasants, and dealing with cadres who were wrongly punished during Party rectification, and to overcome the lingering "leftist" tendencies in the work of concluding land reform. On the other hand, it is necessary to oppose and prevent "rightist" deviations. In concrete work, it means that we should rely on the consciousness of the activists and better elements in the Party branches, poor peasant leagues, and peasant associations in the villages, and based on the principle of both satisfying the demands of poor and lower-middle peasants and taking care of the interests of middle peasants, unite more than 90% of the masses, earnestly follow the mass line. Those whose class status has been wrongly determined must have it re-determined. At the same time, we must carry out the work of compensating middle peasants and resettling landlords and rich peasants in accordance with the Party's policies and the specific circumstances and possible conditions, that is, to carry out the work of correcting deviations and concluding land reform appropriately with leadership, the masses, conditions, and steps. We must seek truth from facts and handle matters according to the situation. If there is still undistributed land and other fruits or public property in the local area, or black land that has been uncovered, or the necessary materials that can be returned without affecting the production and life of those who have been distributed the fruits, these things should be used to appropriately compensate middle peasants or resettle landlords and rich peasants. If there is indeed no land or property as described above in the village and it is very difficult, then we should adopt the method of reducing the amount of public grain levied on wrongly struggled middle peasants over the years, or lend more agricultural loans to wrongly struggled middle peasants, or the government should allocate grain and funds to solve the problem of compensation and resettlement. We should absolutely not force liberated peasants to return the fruits that they should have been allocated and have already been allocated, or return them to the households that were struggled against, regardless of the circumstances. In short, we must first correct deviations and conclude land reform on the basis of consolidating the great achievements of past land reform. When resolving the problems left over from land reform and correcting "leftist" deviations, we must take care of the historical task of satisfying the demands of poor and lower-middle peasants in land reform, and we must still rely on poor and lower-middle peasants and unite with middle peasants to organize a strong mass force. For places where "rightist" deviations have occurred, they should be overcome in a timely manner, and ideological education and organizational handling should be carried out for those who have committed errors according to the nature of the errors, so as to achieve the goal of implementing the correct policies on land reform and Party rectification. Only in this way can we quickly and healthily conclude or complete the work of land reform, and consolidate the achievements of land reform and Party rectification, so that after liberating the productive forces, we can effectively unite the people of all strata, with the working people as the main body, and work together to restore and develop production, and more powerfully support the great people's liberation war.

### 在结束土地改革的地方　纠左必须防右

　　在结束土地改革的地方
  　纠左必须防右
    最近一个时期，在老解放区的大部乡村，在过去两年土地改革伟大成就的基础上，正进行着结束土地改革的工作。很多地方正确地解决了土地改革中所遗留的问题，稳定和提高了农村各阶层人民的生产情绪，获得了成绩。虽然有些地方，对于过去土地改革运动中一度流行的某些左的偏向和错误，纠正得还不够彻底，以致在结束土地改革工作中仍有一些左倾的残余存在，这种现象必须继续加以纠正。但是在老区半老区土地改革中左的偏向和错误，一般地早已经被停止了，而目前在结束土地改革工作和解决在过去犯左偏错误时所遗留下来的问题中，即在进行停止左偏以后的善后工作中，有些地方，又开始生长着一种右的偏向或错误，例如太岳区的翼城县北丁村、冀鲁豫区的聊阳县王化村和北岳区的易县鱼坨村等地的情形。虽然这种右倾并未发展成为当前普遍的主要的危险，但在个别乡村则已成为当前主要的偏向、如不加以迅速纠正，则亦有成为普遍的主要危险倾向之可能。任何右的偏向或错误，和左的偏向或错误同样，是不能容许的，如果任其发展，就会成为一股逆流，严重地损害土地改革所已得到的伟大成果。
    为了巩固与发展土地改革的成果，正确地结束土地改革工作，各地在继续反对左的思想和错误的同时，必须十分警觉地防止右的偏向和错误的生长，必须认识目前这种右倾的特点，是向右的方面离开了党中央在土地改革工作中依靠贫雇农（包括新中农）、团结中农、没收封建与半封建的土地财产，首先满足贫雇农要求的基本政策，在纠正左倾中只片面地注意补偿中农和安置地富，而不顾贫雇农的困难和意见。翼城县北丁村的工作人员，迫使在全村一百九十三户中占七十户的贫雇农和三十二户中农，将分得的土地财产“不管有无问题，一律全部退还”，给十四家被斗户（其中有十一户被斗以后仍保持着中农生活），以致十七家翻身农民降为赤贫或贫农，一家地主却占有一倍于平均数的土地，九家富农所得土地质量超过贫农半倍，而村中积存的斗争果实，却既未分给贫农，又未用以补偿中农。这就是这种右倾的极端例证之一。此外，有的地方，土地问题并未普遍彻底解决，却已不准备继续认真地解决土地问题；有的地方轻率地把地主又错算成富农，或把旧式富农又错算成新富农或中农，并退还其封建财物；有的地方不愿在照顾中农利益的同时，设法满足贫雇农要求；有的地方不问具体情况如何，笼统地规定对于“被错斗户”必须“全部退还原物”，强迫一切贫雇农成份的新干部必须“承认错误”。与这些政治上的错误相伴而来的，则有两种形式的组织上的错误：一种是在结束土改工作中放弃领导；一种是超过现有的组织，不依靠党内和群众中的积极分子和较好分子，脱离群众，包办代替，用命令主义的方法来实行所谓“自觉的由上而下的强迫无条件纠偏”。在实行这种政治上和组织上的极端错误政策的地方，基本群众垂头丧气，有的贫农甚至被迫逃跑，而地主、旧富农和某些被清洗、被撤职的坏干部、坏党员，却兴高彩烈。
    这种右的错误，是从何而来的呢？犯这种右的错误的，大体上有两种不同的人：一种人是自觉的，他们是混进革命队伍中的地主富农分子，或是具有浓厚地主富农思想的人们，他们实际上反对土地改革，不承认土地改革的必要和土地改革的巨大成绩，处处阻挠土地改革之彻底实行。或者是一些犯过严重自私自利强迫命令脱离群众错误的分子和一些宗派主义分子，他们在土改整党过程中，受过处罚，也许这些处罚有些过分，使他们在土改中受过委屈心怀不满，他们之中的某些人就无原则地同情被群众所斗争的对象，而在实际上成为地主、富农和真正不可救药的坏分子的俘虏，在结束土地改革的过程中，对党的政策的贯彻，也起了阻挠的作用。另一种人是不自觉的，他们或者是思想上有极大的片面性，过去曾经犯了严重的左的错误，造成了许多恶果，纠正左倾错误之后现在又偏到右的方面去了，或者是不会按情况办事，而在实际工作中又确实遇到困难，如在所谓“窟窿大，补绽小”的情形下，他们只知道必须完成补偿与安置的任务，就不问青红皂白，强迫群众退出果实。这些人的大部分，还是我们党内的好同志，但是由于他们的马列主义理论水平太低，思想上带有极大的片面性，作风上的命令主义残余未肃清，因而在执行政策中摇摆不定，发生了偏差。
    因此，各级党委在结束土地改革的地区，必须抓紧领导，既应纠左，又应防右。一方面必须继续认真解决由于过去土地改革工作中左的偏向所造成的许多遗留问题，特别是关于改定成份，补偿中农及整党中处分错了的一些干部问题的处理，并克服在结束土地改革工作中的左倾残余。但在另一方面，又必须反对和防止右的偏向。在具体工作上说，就是应该依靠乡村中党的支部、贫农团和农会中的积极分子与较好分子的自觉，根据既满足贫雇农要求，又照顾中农利益的原则，团结百分之九十以上的群众，认真走群众路线，真正错定成份者，必须改定，同时要按照党的政策及具体情况与可能的条件，来进行补偿中农和安置地富等工作，即是有领导、有群众、有条件、有步骤地恰当地进行纠偏和结束土改的工作。我们必须实事求是地按情况办事，如果当地还有未分配的土地及其他果实或公共财产，或查出的黑地，或是可以退出而又不影响分得果实者生产的和生活的必要资料，就应该用这些东西来适当地补偿中农或安置地富。如果本村确无上述各项土地财物，十分困难，那就应该采取分年减征被错斗中农的公粮，或多借一部分农贷给错斗的中农，或由政府拨给粮款来解决补偿和安置的问题，绝对不应该不问情况如何，强迫翻身农民吐出他们所应该分得和已经分得的果实，退还被斗户。总之，我们首先必须在巩固过去土地改革伟大成就的基础上，来纠正偏向，结束土改，而在解决土改所遗留的问题和纠正左的偏向时，我们必须要照顾土地改革中满足贫雇农要求的历史任务，仍然要依靠贫雇农、团结中农来组织强大的群众队伍。对于发生了右的偏向的地方，应该予以及时的克服，并且按照错误的性质，分别对于犯错误者进行思想上的教育和组织上的处置，以达贯彻关于土改和整党的正确政策之目的。只有这样，我们才能迅速而健康地结束或完成土地改革工作，并巩固土改、整党的成绩，以便在解放生产力之后，确实有效地以劳动人民为主体，团结各阶层人民，共同努力恢复与发展生产，更加有力地支援伟大的人民解放战争。
