　　American Economic Problems
    Question: Prices in the United States plummeted in February, and then it was said that prices in the United States rebounded. I wonder why? Why is the economic crisis in the United States characterized by a sharp drop in prices, while the economic crisis in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is characterized by soaring prices?
    Answer: The economic crisis in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is manifested by soaring prices mainly because:
    First, the main problem of the economic crisis in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is insufficient production. The bureaucratic bourgeoisie headed by the four major families, in combination with American imperialism and the Chinese landlord class, use their autocratic and dictatorial political power to cruelly oppress and exploit people of all strata, resulting in industrial bankruptcy and agricultural decline, and production is decreasing day by day. As a result, domestic production is far from sufficient to meet the needs of the market, which is completely different from the capitalist economic crisis caused by relative overproduction.
    Second, the Kuomintang reactionaries issued large amounts of paper money to supply the needs of the counter-revolutionary civil war. The fiscal deficit is often more than 80 percent of the total budget, and it all depends on the printing press to solve it. Inflation, coupled with shrinking production, are mutually causative, eventually leading to the skyrocketing of prices in the Kuomintang-controlled areas like wild horses running out of control. The current high prices in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the people's frantic rush to purchase goods are manifestations of the deepening economic crisis.
    As for the prices in the United States, they are still fluctuating. Since the price of agricultural products plummeted on February 4, grain prices stopped falling in March, and gradually returned to their original levels after April. This temporary rebound was mainly due to the fact that the Ministry of Agriculture purchased a large amount of wheat in April, May and June for export. However, this artificial method cannot fundamentally solve the sharp drop in prices. According to an Associated Press report on October 9, grain prices in the United States have fallen again. Prior to this, the agency had also successively revealed the fact that grain prices had continued to decline on July 21 and September 12. On October 1, the agency also reported news of production cuts in various factories. The cotton textile, shoemaking, and synthetic rubber industries have begun to reduce production. Even the "busy steel industry," which is closely related to military expansion, admits that steel production is catching up with demand, and even exceeding demand in some cases. " This shows that some commodities in the United States have formed a relative overproduction, and the shadow of economic crisis is gradually emerging.
    Why is the manifestation of the American economic crisis a sharp drop in prices? This is due to relative overproduction. This relative overproduction is mainly due to the profound contradiction between the huge productive forces and the shrinking market. Originally, the industrial productive forces in the United States had more than doubled during the war, and agriculture had also increased by 30 percent. At that time, because the government had 90 billion U.S. dollars in orders every year, there was no worry about sales. After the war, government orders were greatly reduced, and capitalists desperately raised prices in order to pursue excess profits, taking advantage of the shortage of consumer goods for the people during the war. Therefore, prices soared after price controls were lifted in June 1946. On the one hand, this has greatly increased the profits of capitalists. For example, last year's profits reached their peak. The profits of enterprises before tax were 21.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1946, and 12.5 billion after tax. In 1947, they increased to 28.2 billion before tax, and 17 billion after tax. However, on the other hand, the real wages of workers, the basic purchasers, have been sharply reduced. The Pravda newspaper said in March this year that the real wages of American workers have fallen by 15 percent compared with the highest level during the war. The low-wage class, which accounts for a quarter of the population, is already heavily in debt.
    Under such circumstances, the domestic market in the United States is shrinking day by day. What about the foreign market? Due to the economic difficulties in most countries after the war, purchasing power has been greatly reduced. In addition, the United States implements a one-sided trade policy (for example, last year's U.S. exports were 14.4 billion U.S. dollars, and imports were only 5.7 billion U.S. dollars), resulting in a widespread dollar panic in various countries. Britain had a trade deficit of 4.2 billion U.S. dollars in the past two years, and other countries such as Australia and Canada also restricted the import of American goods last fall due to the lack of U.S. dollars. This has created a shrinking foreign market. Even with the export of Marshall Plan "foreign aid" materials, exports in the first half of this year were only 6.7 billion U.S. dollars, a decrease of 17 percent compared with the same period last year. If price increases are taken into account, the decrease reaches 20 percent. Moreover, this is the result of the increase in U.S. imports by 20 percent compared with the same period last year.
    The shrinking domestic and foreign markets have resulted in mountains of American goods that cannot be sold. Taking U.S. grain as an example, the domestic wheat reserves in January this year reached 21.6 million tons, and the farm reserves reached 11.6 million tons, while in the ten years of the agricultural crisis before the war, the reserves were only 6 million tons. Even according to the announcement of the U.S. Department of Commerce, the inventory of industrial products reached 29.8 billion U.S. dollars in June this year, while in 1939 it was only 19 billion U.S. dollars, which is 10.8 billion U.S. dollars more.
    This relative overproduction caused by the shrinking domestic and foreign markets has led to a reduction in production, business closures, and a sharp increase in the number of unemployed. If this situation develops further, the great disaster of economic crisis will come.
    In order to save the impending economic crisis, American capitalists have implemented two measures: "foreign aid" and military expansion. The reason why some commodities, such as steel, have soared at one time is one of the reasons for this.
    However, the Marshall Plan's "foreign aid" loans can only have a temporary easing effect on the American economic crisis. The above-mentioned large-scale purchase of grain by the Ministry of Agriculture can only stabilize prices temporarily, which is one example. However, due to the American imperialists' "foreign aid" purpose, it is not really to promote the production of the recipient countries, but to maintain and expand the American goods market and enslave the people of various countries. Therefore, this aggressive plan that suffocates the economy of the recipient countries not only cannot increase the purchasing power of various countries, but also makes the economies of various countries more difficult, the U.S. dollar is becoming increasingly scarce, and the U.S. foreign market cannot be expanded. The aforementioned decrease in exports in the first half of this year is a clear proof. In addition, the total "foreign aid" loan from the United States this year is only 6 billion U.S. dollars, which is only a fraction of the generally estimated total output value of 246 billion U.S. dollars this year, which is a drop in the bucket and will not help.
    As for the other magic weapon of military expansion, due to the increase in military spending to 15 billion, accounting for more than 36 percent of the total annual budget (if the 500 million for atomic energy research and 600 million for strategic material storage are included, it will reach 40 percent of the total annual budget), it can naturally absorb part of the products, but it will not fundamentally avoid the overproduction. Because in today's situation where the democratic forces greatly exceed the imperialist forces, the reactionary conspiracy of American imperialism to incite war will inevitably be defeated by the people's democratic forces, making military expansion unable to continue indefinitely. Moreover, as a result of military expansion, military spending will increase greatly, making the people even poorer and purchasing power further reduced, thereby deepening the degree of the impending crisis.
    From this, we can see that the American economic crisis is bound to come and is unavoidable. The reason is that Chairman Mao pointed out in his report last December: "The economic power of American imperialism, which was strengthened during World War II, has encountered an unstable and shrinking domestic and international market. The further shrinking of this market will lead to the outbreak of an economic crisis."

　　美国经济问题
    问：美国二月间物价暴跌，以后又说美国物价回涨，不知是为什么？为什么美国的经济危机是物价暴跌，而国民党区的经济危机是物价暴涨？
    答：国民党区经济危机之所以表现为物价暴涨，其原因主要是：
    第一、国民党区的经济危机的主要症结是生产不足。以四大家族为首的官僚资产阶级与美国帝国主义及中国地主阶级结合起来，利用其专制独裁的强制政治权力，残酷的压榨与剥削各阶层人民，造成工业破产、农业衰弱，生产日益减少。致使国内生产远不足以供应市场的需要，这与资本主义经济危机的由于生产相对过剩，截然不同。
    第二、国民党反动集团大量发行纸币，以供应反革命内战的军需。财政赤字常在总预算百分之八十以上，全靠印钞机来解决。通货膨胀再加上生产萎缩，相互因果，终致促使国民党区物价如脱缰野马疯狂奔腾不可收拾。目前国民党区物价高涨，人民疯狂抢购物资，就是经济危机加深的表现。
    至于美国物价，至今仍处于波动中。自从二月四日以农产品为首的物价发生暴跌后，一直至三月，粮价始一度停止下跌，四月后则逐渐恢复原有水平。这种暂时的回涨，主要是由于当时农业部曾大量收购四、五、六三个月小麦向外输出的结果。但是这种人工的办法，是不能根本解决物价的暴跌的。据十月九日美联社报导：美国粮价又告下跌，而在此以前，该社七月二十一日及九月十二日亦曾相继透露粮价连续降跌的事实。十月一日该社又报导各工厂进行减产的消息，绵织、制鞋、人造橡皮等工业已开始减产，就连与扩军有极密切关系时“生产忙碌的制钢业，也承认钢产正赶上需要，而且在某些情况下甚至超过需要。”这表明美国某些商品已形成了相对的生产过剩，经济危机的阴影，正在逐渐地隐然出现中。
    美国经济危机的表现形态为什么是物价暴跌呢？这是由于生产相对过剩的缘故。这种生产的相对过剩，主要是由于庞大的生产力与日益缩小了的市场之间发生了深刻矛盾的结果。原来美国工业生产力，战时曾增加了一倍以上，农业也增加了百分之三十。那时因为政府每年有九百亿美元的定货，不愁销路。战后，政府定货大减，资本家为了追求超额利润，利用战时人民消费物资缺少的情况拼命抬高物价，因此物价管制在一九四六年六月撤销后百物飞涨。这一方面固然使资本家的利润大增，例如去年利润达到最高峰，企业公司的利润在纳税前，一九四六年为二百十一亿美元，纳税后为一百二十五亿，一九四七年纳税前增至二百八十二亿，纳税后增至一百七十亿。但另一方面却使基本购买者的工人实际工资因而锐减。今年三月真理报说，美国工人实际工资已较战时最高数目降低了百分之十五。占人口四分之一的低薪阶层，且已负债累累。
    在这种情况下，美国国内市场遂日趋缩小。国外市场呢？则又因大多数国家在战后的经济困难，购买力大大降低了。加之美国实行一面倒的贸易政策（例如去年美国输出为一四四亿美元，输入仅五十七亿），结果使各国普遍发生美元恐慌。英国过去两年入超四十二亿美元，其他如澳、加等国，亦莫不因美元缺乏而相继于去年秋季限制美货输入。这就造成了国外市场的日趋萎缩。甚至虽有马歇尔计划“援外”物资的输出，今年上半年的输出也只有六十七亿美元，比去年同期减少了百分之十七，如将物价上涨计入，则减少达百分之二十。而且这还是美国输入比去年同期增加了百分之二十的结果。
    国内外市场的日趋缩小，遂使美货堆积如山，卖不出去。以美国粮食为例，今年一月小麦国内存量已达二千一百六十万吨，农场存量达一千一百六十万吨，而在战前十年的农业危机的时期里，其存量亦不过六百万吨而已。工业品的存货，即使根据美商务部的公告，今年六月已达二百九十八亿美元，而一九三九年时则仅一百九十亿美元，即多了一百零八亿美元。
    这种因国内外市场日益缩小所招致的相对的生产过剩，引起了生产的缩减，企业倒闭与失业人数的剧增。这种情况如果进一步发展，经济危机的大灾难就会到来。
    美国资本家为了挽救行将到来的经济危机，曾实行“援外”与扩军两项措施，某些物品如钢铁等之一度暴涨，其原因之一即在于此。
    然而，马歇尔计划的“援外”贷款，对美国经济危机只能把暂时的缓和作用，上面所说农业部大批收购粮食仅能使价格暂趋平稳，即其一例。但由于美国帝国主义者的“援外”目的，并不是真的要促进受援国的生产，而是要维持并扩大美货市场，奴役各国人民。因此，这一窒息受援国经济的侵略计划，不仅不能提高各国的购买力，反而促使各国经济更加困难，美元日趋缺乏，美国的国外市场无法扩大。前面所说的今年上半年输出减少，即其明证。此外，美国今年全部“援外”贷款亦不过六十亿，仅为一般估计的今年生产总值二千四百六十亿的一个零头，杯水车薪，无济于事。
    至于另一个扩军的法宝呢，由于军费增加到一百五十亿，占了全年总预算的百分之卅六以上（如将原子能研究费五亿及战略原料储存费六亿计入，则达全年度总预算的百分之四十），自然可以吸收一部分产品，但决不能根本避免生产的过剩。因为在今天民主力量大大超过帝国主义力量的情势下，美国帝国主义煽动战争的反动阴谋，必将被人民民主力量所击破，使得扩军不能长期地无限制地持续下去。并且由于扩军的结果，军费大增，使人民越发贫穷，购买力更加降低，从而将加深行将到来的危机的程度。
    由此可知，美国经济危机是必然要到来的，不可避免的，这理由就是毛主席去年十二月报告中曾经指出的：“美国帝国主义在第二次世界大战期间所增强起来的经济力量，遇着了不稳定的日趋缩小的国内市场与国际市场，这种市场的进一步缩小，就要引起经济危机的爆发。”
