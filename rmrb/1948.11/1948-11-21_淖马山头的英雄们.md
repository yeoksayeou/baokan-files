　　The Heroes of Naoma Mountain

　　Shang Yi

　　The bandit Yan Xishan personally wrote to the core members of his 40th Division, saying, "Without Naoma, there is no Taiyuan—…".

　　The first and third regiments of the enemy's Eighth Column were defeated by our brother regiment. The two hilltops of Naoma Mountain were then occupied by us. On October 27th and 28th, Yan Xishan dispatched the first and third regiments of his 40th Division and a battalion of the 30th Division to launch eleven large and small counterattacks against our Naoma Mountain.

　　The enemy's organized artillery fire numbered at least a hundred guns. Each time they launched a counterattack, they bombarded half of the eastern mountain, filling the sky with smoke and dust. The forces used were at least a company, at most a regiment. Twice on the first day and nine times on the second day (four major counterattacks). Twice they broke through our front line but were beaten back. As a result, Naoma Mountain remained in the hands of the People's Liberation Army. The enemy died all over the mountain, Naoma Mountain was not recaptured, and the first and third regiments of the 40th Division were again defeated by our unit.

　　For several days, the enemy dared not launch any more crazy attacks to "recapture Naoma," only emitting sporadic artillery fire.

　　How did the soldiers of our unit hold this position firmly?

　　When the enemy launched small counterattacks against us, the soldiers did not expend much effort or consumption. Comrade Li Huaiyun discovered an enemy platoon approaching his position while eating breakfast on the morning of the 28th. Huaiyun told everyone to continue eating while he personally fought the enemy. On the 27th, Zhang Yong'an killed more than twenty enemies with a single rifle. Li Guichang had no grenades at hand, so he jumped out of the trench to pick up abandoned grenades and drove the enemy back.

　　When the enemy launched a major counterattack against us on the 27th, they used artillery fire to block our front line. Our soldiers, except for one or two specially assigned to monitor the enemy, mostly took cover. At this time, it seemed as if no one was on our position.

　　"Look! The enemy is approaching our position, why aren't we firing?" A certain artillery comrade said anxiously in the observation post to a certain unit's chief of staff.

　　"Don't worry!" the chief of staff replied with a smile.

　　When the enemy got close to the position, our Seventh Company used short bursts of machine guns, rifles, and grenades to kill and wound the enemy. Two enemy companies fell and rolled away in disarray.

　　Around 10 a.m. on the 28th, the enemy launched four counterattacks against us. Finally, Comrade Zhou Laicun, the second squad leader, was wounded and retreated, leaving a gap. At the same time, this was the junction of two companies, and the enemy came up from there, occupying our first trench. Forty or fifty enemies rushed up in an instant. Our soldiers engaged the enemy in trench warfare. Machine guns, rifles, and small cannons were of no use. In the winding trenches, the enemy was outside, and we were inside, engaging in grenade warfare. When the grenades ran out, Li Huaiyun (deputy platoon leader of the third platoon) rushed towards the enemy with a Japanese broadsword, chopping down an enemy like cutting turnips. Wen Zixin, a new comrade, made a lunge and stabbed an enemy in the chest with his bayonet, unable to pull the blade out. He even pulled the enemy down, frightening the enemy. Shen Hongxi, a bugler, was only seventeen years old, capable, quick, and with bright eyes, resembling a little tiger. He pounced on the enemy and snatched their rifles. At this time, our Battalion Commander Liu and Wang Taiyuan (company commander of the Ninth Company) were also throwing grenades. With a cry of "Charge!" everyone rushed out. Comrades like Jiang Sanlai came up with grenades. A burst of firepower like thunder drove the enemy rolling down the slope.

　　Yan Xishan's counterattacks were repeatedly crushed!

　　Many heroes emerged on Naoma Mountain!

　　淖马山头的英雄们
    尚毅
    阎匪王靖国亲自给他的四十师的基干们写信说：“没有淖马就没有太原－……”。
    敌八纵队的一团三团都被我弟兄团打垮了。淖马山上的两个山头遂被我们占领。十月二十七、廿八两天里，阎匪又调他的四十师一团三团和卅师一个营，向我淖马山头进行了大小十一次的反扑。
    敌人组织的炮火至少要有百余门，每次进行反扑，都要把半个东山，炮轰得烟土飞满天。所用的兵力，至少一个连，最多一个团，第一天两次、第二天九次（大反扑四次）。有两次已冲破我前沿都被打下去，结果淖马山头仍在人民解放军手里。敌人死了满山，淖马山没夺回，四十师的一团三团又被我某部打垮了。
    数天了，敌人再没敢作“夺回淖马”的疯狂进攻，只发出了稀落炮声。
    我某部的战士们是怎样坚守住这块阵地的呢？
    匪军向我们进行小反扑时，战士们并没花费很大的气力和消耗。李怀云同志在二十八号晨吃饭时发现敌人一个排向他的阵地前面上来了，怀云让大家吃饭，他个人一边吃一边打敌人。廿七日张永安一支步枪杀死了二十多个敌人，李桂昌手边没有手榴弹，挺身跳出壕外拣了地上遗弃了的手榴弹就把敌人打回去了。
    当敌人二十七日向我大反扑时，用炮火封锁我前沿，而我们战士除专派一二个人监视敌人以外，大部分都隐避起来。这时候，我阵地上好象没有人了。
    “瞧！敌人接近我阵地了，怎么也不见打呢？”某炮兵同志在观察所里和某部队的参谋长以担心的神态这样说着。
    “放心！”参谋长微笑地答复。
    敌人快进到阵地上了，我七连用短促火力机枪、步枪、手榴弹一齐向敌人杀伤，敌人两个连都倒的倒，滚的滚不成模样了。
    二十八日上午约十时向我反扑四次，最后，二班长周来存同志负伤下去，一时漏下空子，同时这里又是两个连的接合点，敌人从此上来，占了我第一道交通壕，霎时冲上来四五十个，我战士们便与敌人进行壕战，机步枪小炮都用不上，弯弯曲曲的战壕，敌人在外我们在里与敌人进行手榴弹战，手榴弹也用光了，李怀云（三排副排长）手拿日本洋刀向敌人扑去一砍，象削蔓菁似的砍倒了一个敌人；温自信是个新同志挽了个花子（箭步）用刺刀刺入一个敌人的胸膛抽不出刀来，连敌人拉倒回来，吓得敌人胆寒；申宏喜是司号员，年纪不过十七岁，精干迅速眼光炯炯，很象一只小老虎，扑上去和敌人撕夺步枪，这时候我刘营长、王太原（九连长）也都在投弹，一声“冲呀！”大家齐扑出去，姜三赖等同志上来用手榴弹，一阵火力如雷，把敌打得滚下了出坡。
    阎匪的一次一次反扑都这样被打垮了！
    淖马山头涌现出好多的英雄！
