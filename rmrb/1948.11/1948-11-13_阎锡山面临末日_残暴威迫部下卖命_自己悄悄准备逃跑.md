　　Yan Xishan Faces Doom
  　Brutally Coerces Subordinates to Fight to the Death
  　Secretly Prepares to Flee
    [Report from the Taiyuan Front by this newspaper] Frontline reporter Wu Xiang reports: As the old bandit Yan Xishan faces his day of reckoning, he is both brutally coercing his subordinates to fight to the death for him and cunningly preparing his own escape.
    The remnant defeated soldiers and generals of the Jiang-Yan bandit gang trapped in the besieged city of Taiyuan were terrified and demoralized during the Jinzhong Campaign, fleeing or surrendering from their positions one after another. Seeing that all deception and intimidation had failed, the brutal Yan bandits resorted to the most brutal means of slaughter. One deserter from the First Regiment of the 73rd Division was "executed by order" and stabbed to death on the spot with a hail of bullets. Four deserters from the Third Regiment of the 45th Division were "executed by order" all at once. The Yan bandits formed a "Suburban Patrol and Correction Team" from their 25th Gendarmerie Regiment to "monitor and prevent" desertions, and appointed Fu Cunhuai as the "Suiyuan Headquarters督战隊 Commander," specializing in killing people. Not thinking this was enough, he also appointed Yang Zhenji as the director of the "Law Enforcement Office" to implement a killing competition. On August 23, he issued a murderous "handwritten order" forbidding anyone to "retreat a single step" or "lose an inch of ground," threatening to kill anyone who disobeyed. If a "commander" at any level was unwilling to carry out the order, that commander would also be killed. Each company was issued a "law enforcement pistol," and each battalion was issued a "law enforcement saber," with elaborate ceremonies and mobilization rallies held to distribute the weapons. All levels of principal officers were required to fill out "oaths" and "blood pledges," guaranteeing their "loyalty to the end," or else "willing to accept extreme punishment." These vicious methods did prevent Yan bandit officers and soldiers from easily retreating, but they also shattered any illusions they had about Yan Xishan, leading them to more resolutely lay down their weapons and become prisoners, or to voluntarily surrender. This reporter met a recent group of Yan bandit soldiers who were pale and haggard from hunger and fatigue. When asked about the "August 23rd handwritten order," those sallow faces became even more unsightly with horrified memories. It is no wonder they paled at the mere mention of the matter, considering the number of headless ghosts who had fallen under Yan’s so-called "law enforcement saber," including Wang Xiushan, the regimental commander of the Second Regiment of the 45th Provisional Division, Duan Jixu, the commander of the Nie Jushan blockhouse, Xiao Lifeng, the regimental commander of the Infantry Heavy Artillery Regiment, and Hao Zhizhong, the regimental commander of the Seventh Regiment of the People's Defense Army. These four were all colonels, so who knows how many wronged souls there were among the lower-ranking officers and soldiers? Gao Guanwang, a private first class in the First Company of the First Regiment of the 49th Provisional Division, was on guard duty at midnight and was executed on the spot simply because he was too tired and drowsy. The dehumanized Yan bandit even issued a "circular praising the enforcers" for their conscientious adherence to orders. Yan said: "If I retreat from my position, the executors of the organization (referring to the Comrades Association) can also kill me. Only by thoroughly implementing the "handwritten order" can we guarantee the victory of defending Taiyuan, and then restore the province with the city, create miracles, and establish extraordinary achievements." Look at the intense bloodiness that is revealed in this ridiculous dream!
    Just as Yan's brutality is unsurpassed, so is his cunning. He thinks that his "far-sighted" arrangements for a way out are beyond anyone's comprehension. According to Zhao Chengshou, the captured deputy director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters and commander-in-chief of the Field Army, Yan's main assets have long been deposited in Japan and the United States. Last December, he sent Peng Shihong, the manager of the Northwest Industrial Company, to the United States on the pretext of "visiting" to collude directly with American imperialism. This spring, when Chennault came to Shanxi, he flattered and fawned over him, offering expensive ivory cucumbers (antiques) as a gift. After Linfen was liberated by our army, he and the families of some of his "senior cadres" fled to Beiping one after another. He is a "cunning rabbit with three burrows," and he has also established homes in Shanghai and Taiwan. His son, Yan Zhimin, and his brothers have already flown to Shanghai from Beiping with many people, and his niece Qu Xianchun was sent to Taiwan long ago to arrange everything. This last point is a secret even to his most trusted "senior cadres." Qu Xianchun once boasted to Zhao Chengshou's third concubine, inadvertently revealing the secret, but immediately regretted it and instructed her to keep it strictly confidential on his behalf. Zhao Chengshou, who had followed Yan for decades, could not help but feel resentful, feeling that the old bandit was not "loyal" enough. It must be pointed out that Yan will never be willing to give up his golden palace in Taiyuan until he is completely desperate. It must also be pointed out that Yan dares to be so brutal not because he has any determination or confidence to hold on to the city. On the contrary, it is precisely because he has prepared everything for his escape, thinking that he can simply board a plane and slip away at the last moment. He is deeply afraid that the airport outside the city is unreliable, so he is driving thousands of starving citizens with whips and bayonets to rush to repair the East Airport, which is close to the city wall. The old bandit Yan Xishan, who has scraped all the fat from the people of Shanxi, has been living luxuriously for sixty-six years. October 11 (the ninth day of the ninth lunar month) is his birthday, but precisely on the evening of the tenth, the shells of the powerful Liberation Army besieging Taiyuan fell into the Taiyuan city, where Yan’s Pacification Headquarters was located, and two-thirds of the city's lights went out immediately, scaring the old bandit so much that he didn't even dare to celebrate his birthday. These shells before his birthday are a death knell and a warning to Yan Xishan. Now, Wusu Airport has been occupied by us, and the airports in the south, east, and north of the city are all under our artillery fire. The doomsday of the local emperor has arrived. There is only one last opportunity for him to choose between Wang Yaowu, Fan Hanjie, and Zheng Dongguo. The Liberation Army has been impatiently awaiting the order to launch a general attack. Our heroic and invincible soldiers have nothing more to say: "If the enemy does not surrender, we will annihilate them all."

### 阎锡山面临末日　残暴威迫部下卖命　自己悄悄准备逃跑

　　阎锡山面临末日
  　残暴威迫部下卖命
  　自己悄悄准备逃跑
    【本报太原前线电】前线记者吴象报导：阎锡山老贼面临末日审判之时，一方面以惊人的残暴威迫他的部下为他卖命，另一方面却狡黠地悄悄准备自己单独逃跑。
    困守太原危城的蒋阎匪残兵败将，在晋中战役中，已经吓得丧魂失魄，纷纷从阵地上逃亡或投降。残暴的阎匪看见一切欺骗恫吓均归失败，就使出最残暴的惨杀手段，七十三师一团一个逃兵“奉谕”被当场乱枪刺死了。整四五师三团四个逃兵“奉谕”一次全部杀死了。阎匪以其宪兵二十五团组成“市郊巡回纠察队”，四出“监视防范”，又任命傅存怀为“绥署督战队司令”，专门杀人。他还觉得不够，又任命杨贞吉为“执法处”处长，实行杀人竞赛。八月二十三日，他还下了一道杀气腾腾的“手令”不准“退一步”，“失寸土”，“违者杀”。那一级“官长”不忍下手，就连那级官长都杀。每连发一支“执法手枪”，每营发一把“执法刀”，并且装腔作势举行隆重的授枪授刀典礼和动员大会。各级主官均须填写“誓词”“血书”，向他保证“忠实到底”，否则，“愿受极刑”。这种毒狠手段确曾使阎匪官兵不敢轻易后退，但同时也使他们断绝了对阎锡山的任何幻想，更坚决的放下武器做俘虏，或自动投诚。记者遇见最近过来的一批阎匪士兵，他们由于饥饿疲惫，脸色枯黄。当记者问到“八月二十三日手令”时，那些枯黄的脸，因惊恐的回忆而更加难看了。很难怪他们谈虎色变，在阎贼所谓“执法刀”下做了断头鬼的，已经有暂四十五师二团团长王秀山，聂具山守碉司令段继续，步兵重炮团团长萧利锋，民卫军第七团团长郝志忠。这四个都是上校，谁知道下级官兵的冤魂有多少呢？暂四九师一团一连一等兵高官旺午夜担任警戒，仅仅因为困乏过甚，打了瞌睡，也被就地处死了。失去人性的阎贼竟还“通令表扬执法者”的认真不苟。阎贼说：“我如退守阵地，组织（指为同志会）执行人也可把我打死。只有把“手令”贯彻到底才能保证保卫太原的胜利，进而以城复省，创造奇迹，建立奇功。”。请看在这可笑的梦想之中，透出了何等浓烈的血腥味呀！
    正如阎贼的残暴是绝顶的，他的狡黠也是绝顶的。他以为自己按排后路的“深谋远虑”没有人能够搞得清楚，据晋中被俘的阎匪太原绥署副主任兼野战军总司令赵承绶谈，阎贼的主要财产早已存到日本和美国，去年腊月，他又派西北实业公司经理彭士弘到美国去，借口“参观”直接与美帝国主义勾结。今春陈纳德一来井，他又曲意逢迎献媚，以名贵的象牙黄瓜（古玩）作进见之礼。临汾被我军解放后，他和他手下一些“高干”的眷属纷纷飞逃北平。他“狡兔三窟”，又另在上海和台湾安了家，他的儿子阎志敏兄弟已经带着不少人由北平飞到上海了，他的婊侄曲宪椿则早已派到台湾布置一切。这最后一点，对他最亲信的“高干”都是秘密的。曲宪椿一次向赵承绶的第三个小老婆吹牛，无意中泄漏了出来，但立即失悔万分，嘱咐她务须代为严守。曾经追随阎贼数十年的赵承绶，这时也不禁憝懑，他感到老贼太不够“朋友”。必须指出，阎贼不到完全绝望的时候，决不肯放弃太原的金銮宝殿。更必须指出，阎贼所以敢于如此残暴，绝非因为他有什么死守的决心和把握。相反的，恰恰因为他已经为逃跑准备好一切，以为最后独自坐上飞机就可以溜之大吉。他深恐城外的机场靠不住，于是又用皮鞭刺刀驱赶着成千上万饥饿的市民，为他赶修紧靠城墙的东机场。刮尽山西人民膏脂的老贼阎锡山，已经作威作福地活了六十六年了。十月十一（阴历九月初九）是他的生日，但是恰恰就在十日晚上，围攻太原的强大解放军的炮弹已经落到了太原城内阎贼的绥靖公署，全城电灯立时熄灭了三分之二，吓得老贼连生日也不好过了。这生日前的几颗炮弹，对阎锡山就是一个死兆，也是一个警告。现在，武宿机场已被我占领，城南、城东、城北各个机场亦均在我炮火控制之下，土皇帝的末日降临了。只有一个最后的机会让他在王耀武范汉杰与郑洞国之间作一选择。解放军等候总攻击令已经等得很不耐烦了。我们英勇无敌的战士没有多的话说：“敌人不投降就全部消灭它”。
