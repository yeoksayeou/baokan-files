　　Storing Public Grain Requires Careful Planning
Currently, all regions are collecting and storing public grain. Therefore, I suggest that responsible cadres in warehouses in all regions should have careful plans in advance to avoid wasting manpower and animal power. In the past, most warehouse departments in various regions lacked overall planning for the capacity of the warehouses, the manpower for receiving and storing, and the time involved. They often blindly notified all villages in the area to store public grain at a certain warehouse on a certain day. Due to the masses' enthusiasm for paying public grain, some villages got up in the middle of the night to load and transport it, resulting in grain transporters from all villages flocking together, crowding the area, with loud voices and congested vehicles. The masses rushed to be first, and the cadres were sweating profusely. As a result, either the collection could not be completed on the same day, or the warehouse capacity was too small, and the vehicles had to be transferred elsewhere. Therefore, some had to wait one or two days to deliver. In order to save manpower and animal power, when storing public grain this year, the responsible cadres must plan in advance, prepare well, know how many warehouses there are, how much capacity they have, how many cadres there are, and how much they can receive each day. Then, based on the amount of public grain in each village and the distance, they should notify which villages should come on the first day, which villages should come on the second day, and where each village should send the grain. In this way, with planning in advance and order in execution, both manpower and animal power can be saved, and it can be done quickly and accurately.

　　收存公粮要有周密计划
    目前各地都在征收与储存公粮；因此我建议各地仓库负责干部，在事先一定要有周密的计划，以免浪费人力畜力。在过去，各地大多数仓库部门，对仓库的容量，收存的人力、时间，缺乏通盘的计划，常盲目地通知全区所有村子于某日往某仓储存公粮。由于群众交纳公粮的积极，有的村半夜起来装运，结果各村运粮者蜂拥而来，挤在一处，人声嘈杂，车马挤塞，群众争先恐后，干部急的满头大汗。结果不是当天不能收完，就是仓库容量太小，车辆再往别处转运。因此，有等一天至两天而交不上的。为了节约人力畜力，在今年储存公粮时，负责干部一定要预先计划好，准备好，有几个仓子，容量多少，有多少干部，每天能收多少，然后再根据各村公粮数目，路程远近，通知哪几个村第一天来，哪几个村第二天来，哪几村往哪里送。这样事前有计划，执行中有秩序，既节省人力畜力，又迅速准确。
