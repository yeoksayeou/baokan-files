    Work Done Must Be Reported
    Fuping and Pingding Strengthen Communication Work
    [Our Newspaper News] In order to earnestly implement the policy of the whole party running newspapers and effectively strengthen communication and reporting work, Fuping, Pingding and other counties have all held meetings to review and formulate specific measures for the future. The Fuping County Party Committee believes that the main shortcomings of communication work during this period are: the county party committee leadership's thinking emphasizes organization and neglects propaganda, believing that organizational work must be done, while propaganda work can be delayed. Therefore, the allocation of propaganda cadres in counties and districts is not sound, which affects the leadership of communication work. In particular, the county party committee, under the pretext of being busy with work, did not organize reporting after completing the work. In order to overcome the shortcomings in communication work, first, each member of the county party committee guarantees to write one article per month, and also organizes a comprehensive work report. The leadership includes communication work as one of the daily tasks and appoints a county party committee to specifically lead this work, and restores and establishes communication organizations to strengthen leadership. At the same time, it is advocated that communication should be written after work is done, and if it is not written, it is not considered a complete completion of the work. The Propaganda Department of the Pingding County Party Committee also held a meeting of correspondents from county agencies on the 16th of this month to conduct criticism and self-criticism on communication work. Everyone unanimously agreed that the reason for not writing articles in the past was not a lack of material, but that everyone did not write. Those who did write were disappointed because their articles were not published and stopped writing. This attitude has caused great damage to communication work. Regarding how to improve communication and reporting work, everyone has researched the following points: (1) The Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee should strengthen the promotion of leading cadres in various agencies to personally write and lead, driving everyone to write. Each department should appoint a dedicated person to promote the work of the communication group in the leading department. (2) Hold correspondent meetings at regular intervals to review communication work. Communication groups are required to write according to a plan. (3) Correspondents are required to write more than two articles per month.

    做了工作一定报导
    阜平平定加强通讯工作
    【本报讯】阜平、平定等县为认真贯彻全党办报方针，切实加强通讯报导工作，均开会检讨，并定出今后具体办法。阜平县委认为这时期通讯工作的主要缺点是：县委领导思想上存在着重组织轻宣传，认为组织工作不做不行，宣传工作迟延些还可以。因此县区宣传干部配备不健全，影响对通讯工作的领导。特别是县委借口工作忙，做了工作不组织报导。为克服通讯工作中的缺点，首先县委每人每月保证写一篇稿，而且要组织一综合性的工作报导。领导上把通讯工作列入日常工作之一。并指定一县委专领导这一工作。并恢复与建立通讯组织加强领导。同时提倡做了工作写通讯，不写即不算全部完成了工作。平定县委宣传部于本月十六日亦召开了县机关通讯员会议，对通讯工作进行了批评与自我批评。大家一致认为过去不写稿并不是没有材料，而是大家不写。就是写的因没登出而失望不写了。这种态度对通讯工作受到很大损失。关于如何改进通讯报导工作问题，大家研究出以下几点：（一）县委宣传部应加强推动各机关负责干部亲自动手写稿与领导，带动大家写。各部门应指定专人来推动领导部门的通讯小组工作。（二）在一定时期召开通讯员会议，检查通讯工作。要求通讯小组要有计划的来写。（三）要求通讯员每月写两篇以上的稿子。
