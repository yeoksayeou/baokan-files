Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 30th: Public and private enterprises in Northeast China are paying attention to improving technology and cultivating talent, leading to continuous new creations in industry. The Northeast First Mining Area, due to improved coal mining methods, has surpassed its total output for the entire previous year in just nine months this year, with the same number of people and working hours. The Mudanjiang Middle-East Petroleum Research Institute, following its successful manufacturing of fuel oil, "Mao Bi Lu" oil (for lubrication), and machine cleaning oil in June, has, through continuous research in recent months, also successfully produced several types of oil, such as sewing machine oil and "Gu Li Si" oil, essential for machine ball bearings, with good results. Wang Mingshan, manager and technician of the Dongming Chemical Factory in Harbin, after six months of research, successfully manufactured acidified degreasing oil using soybean oil, salt, alkali, bittern, lime, etc. This oil can be used not only as electrical (transformer) heat-resistant oil, mechanical cleaning oil, drying oil, cylinder oil, etc., but also as edible oil and gun oil, with a wide range of uses. The Jilin Public Firecracker Factory and the private Jinhua and Taifeng factories recently jointly established a technical research association to analyze and study the technical shortcomings of each factory and, based on the research results, re-allocate raw materials, thereby improving product quality. Workers from several factories in Harbin and Hejiang have organized technical research classes or supplementary schools to study mechanical drawing, arithmetic, and other subjects, with high enthusiasm.

　　东北注意改进技术培养人材
  　工业上有许多新创造
    【新华社东北三十日电】东北各公私企业注意改进技术、培养人材，在工业上迭有新创造。东北第一矿区因改进了采煤方法，在同等人数、工时不变条件下，今年九个月的产量，超过了去年全年产量。牡丹江中东机油研究所，继六月间制造燃料油，毛必鲁油（滑润用）、擦机油成功后，经最近几月来连续研究，又制成缝纫机用油及机器滚珠必须使用的古利斯油等数种，成效均好。哈尔滨市东明化学厂经理兼技师王明山，经六个月研究，用豆油、食盐、土碱、卤水、石灰等，制造酸化脱脂油成功。该油不但可作电器（变电器）耐热油、机械清油、干油、汽缸油等，且可食用、擦枪，用途甚大。吉林公营火柴厂与私营金华、泰丰两厂，最近联合成立技术研究会，对各厂技术上的缺点加以分析研究，并按研究结果，重新配置原料，因之产品质量提高。哈尔滨与合江若干工厂工人，组织技术研究班或补习学校，学习机械制图、算学等课，情绪高涨。
