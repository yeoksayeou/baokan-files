Telegraphic Agency London, October 29th: British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt, in discussing the trial of twelve American Communist Party leaders scheduled to begin in New York on November 1st, wrote: The only crime of the American Communist Party is that they are Marxists. Now, American trusts are acting to seize world hegemony. Now, they are preparing to wage war against socialist and people's democratic countries. The first people they want to strike are those who, within the United States, lead the struggle for peace and democracy. The attack on the American Communist Party is only the first step in a further attack on communists, socialists, trade unionists, liberals, intellectuals, and people who love peace and democracy. These people, in any country, are blocking America's war plans. Pollitt recalled that twenty-three years ago, twelve leaders of the British Communist Party were thrown into prison under fabricated charges. Now it is publicly acknowledged that this was part of the Conservative Party's and capitalists' preparations to undermine labor in 1926. Today, the task facing the British working class and people is to demonstrate their solidarity with the twelve American Communist Party leaders; their struggle is our struggle, it is a struggle for living standards and peace.

    英共总书记波立特
    号召英国工人阶级团结支援美共斗争
    【新华社陕北二日电】电通社伦敦十月二十九日讯：英共总书记波立特在论订于十一月一日在纽约开始的对十二位美国共产党领袖的审讯时写道：美国共产党唯一的罪名，就是他们是马克思主义者。现在，美国托辣斯在为取得世界霸权而行动。现在，他们正在准备对社会主义和人民民主国家作战。他们首先要打击的是在美国国内领导争取和平与民主的斗争的人们和政党。对美国共产党的进攻，只是更进一步的进攻共产主义者、社会主义者、职工运动者、自由主义者、知识分子和爱好和平与民主的人们的第一步。这些人在任何一个国家里，阻挡着美国的战争计划。波立特追道，在二十三年以前，英国共产党的十二位领袖曾在捏造的罪名下被投入监狱。现在这件事情已被公的承认是保守党与资本家一九二六年为损毁工而作的准备工作的一部分。今天，英国工人阶级和人民面前的任务，是表现他们与十二位美共领袖的团结，他们的斗争就是我们的斗争，这是争取生活水准与和平的斗争。
