　　Technical Dissemination Issues in Saltpeter Boiling
    Kui Lin
    From April to the end of August, Xingtai produced more than 96,000 catties of saltpeter, and the masses earned 638,842 catties of millet. This not only supplied raw materials for munitions but also supported the sideline production of the masses. However, based on the saltpeter soil conditions in the saltpeter-producing areas and the needs of the masses, the development of saltpeter production is still far from sufficient. There is still a need to greatly develop it after autumn this year. In the development process, there are still many problems, such as the organizational forms and business management of saltpeter workshops or mass sideline production, the profit distribution system, and the contradictions among the masses in scraping saltpeter soil. These all need to be resolved well, but the most important issue is the dissemination of technology. According to the current situation, the First District has the most saltpeter pots and more technicians. Many villages in the Second and Fourth Districts have saltpeter soil, but no one knows how to boil it (although some villages in the Second District already have some foundation, they are still far behind). Many people want to learn how to boil saltpeter, but they are suffering from the lack of someone to teach them. Especially this year, after a drought followed by flooding, the harvest is not good, and the masses are even more eager for this production method. They are asking the government and the Saltpeter Bureau to solve the technical problems.

    The main reason why saltpeter boiling technology could not be smoothly disseminated in the past was that the technicians had old ideological awareness. They believed that "competitors are enemies" and that teaching others would encroach on their own interests, so they were unwilling to easily pass on the technology to others. But on the other hand, it was also due to the influence of certain biases in the organization of production work in the past, which made some people think that technicians should unconditionally and without any compensation teach them. Technicians wasted a lot of work in vain and were constantly attacked. For example, Shen Duan, from Xianyu Village, was a well-to-do middle peasant who had donated land during the land reform. He was willing to teach the masses. At first, he organized a saltpeter boiling group of nine people to teach everyone. Later, some people, in order to boil saltpeter themselves and learn the technique, disregarded Shen Duan's interests. They didn't consult with Shen Duan before boiling saltpeter and started boiling it themselves. Halfway through the boiling, they didn't understand it very well and were not sure, so they went to Shen Duan to watch the fire. Sometimes Shen Duan himself was boiling saltpeter, and if he didn't go to watch for others, they would come to his door. If he went, he would have to put down his own pot, which was very difficult. At the same time, because the beginners scraped poor saltpeter soil, the saltpeter produced was small and of poor quality, he was also blamed by the masses. Shen Duan felt that he had wasted his work in vain and was not appreciated, so he no longer took the initiative to teach others. The number of saltpeter boilers in Xianyu Village has not increased in the past six months, which is detrimental to both the public and private interests.

    Solving this problem should start from two aspects. On the one hand, educate the technicians, let them understand the important role of gunpowder in the People's Liberation War, improve their political consciousness, and recognize that disseminating technology is glorious. At the same time, ensure that the saltpeter boiling masses have a certain profit, so that they are not affected by development. Give different education to different people: for example, for ordinary liberated masses, in addition to mobilizing them from the perspective of supporting the war, mobilize them from the perspective of unity and development of production. For military dependents, explain that more saltpeter boiling means that the Kuomintang reactionaries will be defeated sooner, and their children will be able to return home sooner. For landlords and rich peasants who know how to boil saltpeter, also educate and reform them to develop together with the masses. This is one aspect. On the other hand, educate the masses to respect the technicians, humbly learn from them, and overcome some incorrect views on technicians in the past. In addition, we must also combine the following specific tasks: (1) Commend the positive aspects of technicians. For example, Guo Guifen from Dongjing'an Village is very willing to teach others. He led 20 households to boil saltpeter in the spring, and the masses supported him very much. Continuously commend and reward such people to educate those who are unwilling to teach others. (2) Mobilize and use the relationships between neighbors, relatives, and friends to teach each other. For example, Yang Zhai Lin from Dongwang Village knows how to boil saltpeter, and he teaches whoever he likes, which is also acceptable. If there is no one in the village who knows how to boil, it is also good to go to other villages to find relationships to learn how to boil. (3) Do not let technicians suffer losses in teaching apprentices. At a minimum, wages should be paid according to the profits earned from their own labor, so as to achieve equivalent exchange. (4) Use various forms such as technical seminars, mutual visits, and training to disseminate technology. (5) Carry out a movement to respect teachers and love apprentices. Apprentices should respect teachers and study hard. Teachers should explain the principles and methods to their apprentices very well.
    In short, solve various problems in various forms from all aspects to disseminate technology and launch a movement to take on apprentices in the autumn saltpeter production. By the end of the year, each of the existing 370 technicians will teach one apprentice, so that saltpeter production will develop.

　　熬硝中的技术传播问题
    奎林
    邢台硝磺生产自四月份至八月底，全县市共产硝九万六千多斤，群众赚得小米六十三万八千八百四十二斤。不仅供给了军火原料，并扶植了群众副业生产。但是根据产硝地区的硝土条件和群众要求，硝业生产发展还很不够，今年秋后还有大加发展的必要。在发展当中还存在着不少问题，如硝坊或群众性的副业生产中的组织形式和经营管理问题，分红制度，在刮硝土中群众间的矛盾问题等，都需要很好的解决，但最主要的问题是技术的传播问题。根据目前情况，一区硝锅最多，技术人员也较多，二区、四区，不少村庄有硝土而没人会熬（二区部分村庄虽已有些基础，但还差得很远）。不少群众都想学会熬硝，但苦于没有人教。特别是今年先旱后淹，年成不好，群众对这个生产门路就要求的更加迫切了，他们要求政府和硝磺局解决技术问题。
    过去熬硝技术不能顺利传播的主要原因，是技术人员存在着旧的思想意识，他们认为“同行是冤家”，教给别人就要侵占自己的利益，因此不肯轻易把技术传给别人。但另一方面也由于过去组织生产工作中的某些偏向的影响，使部分群众认为技术人员就应当无条件地、毫无代价地教给自己。技术人员白白误了很多工，还不断受到打击，如先于村沈端是个富裕中农，土改中曾献过田，他倒是愿意教群众。开始他组织了九个人的熬硝小组教大家，后来有的群众为了自己熬硝和学手，就不顾沈端的利益了。在熬硝以前不和沈端商量，自己就下手熬了。熬到半路自己又不很懂，没有把握，才去找沈端给看火。有时沈端自己也正在熬硝，不去给别人看吧，人家找到门上来了；去吧，自己的锅就得放下，非常作难。同时因为初学手刮的硝土不好，出的硝少又不好，他还受到群众埋怨。沈端觉得自己白误了工还落不是，以后就不主动的教别人了。先于村的熬硝人员半年来就没有增加。对公对私都是不利的。
    解决这个问题应从两方面入手。一方面教育技术人员，让他们了解火硝在人民解放战争中的重大作用，提高政治觉悟，认识传播技术是光荣的。同时保证熬硝群众一定的利润，使不因发展而受到影响。对各种不同的人给以不同的教育：如对一般翻身群众，除从支援战争上教育外，就是从大家团结发展生产上动员。对军属说明熬硝多了，早日打败国民党反动派，子弟就能早日回家团圆。对于地主富农中会熬硝的人员，也教育改造他们和群众一道发展，这是一方面。另一方面是教育群众要尊重技术人员，虚心向人家学习，克服过去对技术人员某些不正确的看法。此外还要结合以下几个具体工作：（一）表扬技术人员的积极面。如东静庵村郭贵芬很愿意教别人，一春天他就带领了二十户熬硝，群众对他很拥护。对这样的人不断给以表扬奖励，用以教育那些不愿教别人的。（二）发动利用邻家、亲戚、朋友等关系互相教学。如东汪村杨宅林会熬硝，谁和他好他就教给谁，这样也是可以的。如果本村没有会熬的，到外村去找关系学熬也好。（三）不让技术人员在教徒弟中吃亏。误了工最低限度要按自己劳动所得利润给工资，作到等价交换。（四）用各种形式如技术座谈会，互相访问，和训练等办法传播技术。（五）开展尊师爱徒运动，学徒要尊敬老师，要好好学习，教师要很好的给徒弟讲解道理，说明办法教给徒弟。
    总之，从各个方面用各种形式解决各种问题，使技术传播起来，在秋后的熬硝生产中掀起一个带徒弟运动。到年底以前，使现有的三百七十个技术人员每人带会一个徒弟，这样熬硝生产就会发展起来。
