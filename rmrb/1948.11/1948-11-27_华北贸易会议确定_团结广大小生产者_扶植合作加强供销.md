The North China Trade General Company convened a joint meeting of managers from subordinate districts, cities, and specialized companies in September. The meeting further specified the guiding principle of "vigorously supporting production and aiding the war" in trade work and determined to strengthen management, strictly implement and formulate various systems, and rapidly move towards enterprise management.

The meeting first pointed out the tasks of trade companies: to organize and develop material exchange, stabilize prices, and correctly allocate social products, thereby achieving the goals of supporting the war and aiding production. Small producers still occupy a major position in agricultural, industrial, and sideline production in our region. Their production is largely blind, and they must rely on commerce to supply raw materials and promote the sale of finished products. To avoid private merchants exploiting the weaknesses of small producers, state-owned stores must organize them through cooperatives to implement cooperation and mutual assistance, which is the only way to guarantee the future development of small producers.

Regarding the relationship between state-owned stores and private merchants, the meeting believed that private commerce could be divided into two different types: one type connects producers and consumers, engaging in legitimate operations that comply with national laws and benefit the national economy and people's livelihoods. This type of commerce is beneficial for regulating materials and stimulating production, and should be allowed to operate and be protected. The other type of merchant engages in speculation, manipulation, and hoarding in violation of national laws, and must be resolutely fought. Their capital must be forced to shift to legitimate industrial and commercial activities, and they must be forced to engage in supply and marketing operations that are conducive to production development under the leadership of state-owned stores. Therefore, the meeting called on all comrades in state-owned stores to learn how to fight against speculative merchants, correctly grasp price policies, and protect the reasonable profits of producers and legitimate merchants.

Regarding the relationship between state-owned commerce and cooperatives, the meeting clearly pointed out that state-owned stores must vigorously support the development of cooperatives and unite the broad masses of small producers through cooperatives to consolidate the leading position of state-owned commerce. The meeting believed that the relationship between state-owned stores and cooperatives should not be regarded as a simple business relationship, and their development should be strongly led. Before cooperatives are reorganized, under the same conditions, state-owned stores should first deal with cooperatives in purchasing finished products and supplying materials. Past disputes between state-owned stores and cooperatives should be actively resolved with local party and government and cooperatives. The erroneous idea of "preferring to deal with private merchants rather than cooperatives" must be resolutely opposed.

Regarding the issue of supporting industrial production, the meeting decided to help them solve the problem of large-scale imported raw materials, such as hardware materials and chemical raw materials, and to solve the purchase of large-scale raw materials from the interior. In terms of promoting the sale of finished products, it was decided to organize various specialized companies to closely integrate with cooperatives, rationally allocate and smoothly promote industrial products, and control the prices of industrial products.

In terms of business philosophy, the conference first sharply criticized the agricultural socialist thinking of some comrades and clearly pointed out that production with development prospects should be vigorously supported. The phenomenon of blindly supporting production regardless of whether it has development prospects, whether the products meet sales needs, or without distinguishing quality and setting prices according to quality, must be resolutely opposed. Some one-sided "poor peasant" viewpoints, such as only providing retail sales to poor peasants and hired laborers, and freight charges for ox carts being higher than those for horse-drawn carts, which ignored the support for the production of other classes, were corrected. This erroneous condescending viewpoint greatly hindered the development of production and must be overcome.

After clarifying the business philosophy, the meeting immediately put forward a business plan for September 1948 to May 1949. In terms of business methods, the meeting particularly pointed out that it is necessary to grasp key points, flexibly use funds, and flexibly buy and sell; to grasp seasonality, buy when necessary, and sell when necessary. On price policy, the meeting emphasized that it is necessary to oppose tailism of following private merchants, and to oppose the isolated thinking of rigidly suppressing and stabilizing prices. Correct price policies should be grasped based on market supply and demand and the laws of material circulation, and reasonable differences in various regions should be maintained.

In terms of enterprise management, the meeting believed that management must be enterprise-oriented, so that it can support production, ensure the capital is preserved in kind, strive to gradually accumulate capital, expand operations, and continuously develop the state-owned economy. Regarding the strictness of economic discipline, the reduction of all unnecessary personnel, the strengthening of business technology, and the system of commercial information reporting, and cadre education, discussions were held and unified regulations were made. In particular, regarding the significance of strictly implementing and formulating various systems, the conference pointed out that due to the complexity of our business, the vastness of the region, and the large amount of capital, there must be a unified, scientific, and strict system to strengthen business management and guidance. Therefore, a new accounting system, a situation reporting system, a work reporting and inspection system, etc., were announced. Finally, regarding the promulgation of the draft economic discipline, the meeting emphasized overcoming anarchy, disorganization, and lack of discipline in the work, ensuring that everyone acts in unison, and successfully completing our political tasks. The formulation of discipline is to improve the enthusiasm and creativity of each working comrade and give full play to a high degree of consciousness in serving the people's cause. Therefore, those with merit must be commended and rewarded, and those with faults must be educated and punished.

　　华北贸易会议确定
  　团结广大小生产者　扶植合作加强供销
    【本报讯】华北贸易总公司曾于九月间召开所属区、市、专业公司经理联席会议，进一步把贸易工作以“大力扶助生产与支援战争”的方针路线加以具体化；并确定加强经营管理，严格与制订各种制度，迅速走上企业化。
    会议首先指出贸易公司的任务：组织与发展物资交流，稳定物价，正确的分配社会生产品，从而实现支援战争与扶助生产的目的。小生产者在我区农、工、副业生产中仍占主要位置，他们生产上盲目性很大，又必须依靠商业供给原料与推销成品。但要避免私商利用小生产者的弱点进行剥削，因此，公营商店必须通过合作社把他们组织起来，实行合作互助，小生产者日益发展的前途才有保证。
    关于公营商店与私商的关系，会议认为：现在私人商业可分为两种不同的类型，一为联系生产者与消费者，进行正当的遵守国家法令的有益于国计民生的经营，他对调剂物资刺激生产有好处，应允许其经营，加以保护。另一种商人则是不守国家法令进行投机操纵、囤积居奇的奸商，必须进行坚决的斗争，迫使他们的资金转向正当的工商业，迫使他们在公营商店的领导下，从事有利于生产发展的供销业务。因此，会议号召公营商店的全体同志们，学会如何与投机商人作斗争，正确地掌握物价政策，并保障生产者与正当商人的合理利润。
    关于公营商业与合作社的关系，会议明确指出：公营商店必须大力扶助合作社的发展，通过合作社团结广大小生产者，以巩固公营商业的领导地位。会议认为：公营商店与合作社的关系，不应被认为是一个简单的业务关系，应大力领导其发展。在合作社还没有整理改造以前，在收买成品与供给物资上，在同样的条件下，应首先与合作社成交。过去公营商店与合作社相互间的争议，应主动的商同地方党政及合作社加以解决。坚决反对“宁与私商往来，不与合作社来往”的错误思想。
    关于扶助工业生产问题，会议决定：帮助他们解决大宗进口原料材料，如五金材料，化学原料等，并解决内地大宗原料之购买。在推销成品上，决定组织各种专业公司，以便与合作社密切结合，合理地分配与顺利地推销工业生产品，并掌握工业品价格。
    在经营思想上，大会首先尖锐地批评了某些同志的农业社会主义思想；明确指出：要大力扶助有发展前途的生产。坚决反对不问生产有无发展前途，生产品是否合乎销路，以及不区别质量与不按质量规定价格等的盲目扶助现象。纠正某些片面的“贫雇观点”，如只对贫雇办理零销，牛车运费高于骡马车等；而忽视了对其他阶层生产的扶助。这种错误的恩赐观点，大大阻碍了生产的发展。必须注意克服。
    在经营思想明确之后，会议随即提出一九四八年九月至一九四九年五月的业务经营计划。在经营方法上，会议特别指出：要掌握重点，资金机动运用，吞吐灵活；要掌握季节性，应买则买，应卖则卖。在物价政策上，会议着重指出：应反对跟着私商跑的尾巴主义，又要反对硬压硬稳裸体跳舞的孤立思想。要根据市场供求情况与物资流转规律，掌握正确的物价政策，保持各地合理的差额。
    在企业管理上，会议认为：必须使经营管理企业化，既能扶助生产，又能实物保本，争取逐渐积累资本，扩大经营，使国营经济不断的向前发展。关于严格经济纪律，减少一切非必要的人员，加强经营技术，及商情报告制度，干部教育等问题，也都做了讨论与统一的规定。特别关于严格与制定各种制度的意义上，大会指出由于我们经营业务的复杂，地区辽阔，资金庞大，必须要有统一的科学的严密制度，以便加强经营管理指导工作，因此就宣布了新的会计制度，在情报告制度，工作报告和检查制度等，最后关于经济纪律草案的颁布，会议更着重指出，克服工作中的无政府，无组织，无纪律状态，保证大家行动一致，胜利完成我们的政治任务，纪律的制定是为提高每个工作同志的积极性和创造性，发挥高度的为人民事业服务的自觉性，所以对有功绩者，必须表扬奖励，对有过错者，必须予以教育处罚。
