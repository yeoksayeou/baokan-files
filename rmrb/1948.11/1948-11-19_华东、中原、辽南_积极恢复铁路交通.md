　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 17th: The East China Railway Administration has smoothly taken over the Kuomintang "Jinpu Railway Administration" and is actively organizing former employees to rush to repair the railway. As soon as Jinan was liberated, the Military Control Commission's Transportation Department organized a railway takeover committee to first oversee all machinery and materials, and appointed active employees who protected materials to assist in the work. Therefore, most of the machinery, tools, materials, and archives taken over were intact. After the takeover work was completed, employee registration, resumption of work, and relief work were carried out. Employees were recruited in batches according to the urgency of the work tasks. Currently, the first and second batches of more than 3,400 workers and more than 900 staff members have resumed their posts one after another, including various talents in engineering, machinery, telecommunications, engineers, transportation, and dispatch management. In order to solve the employees' living difficulties, each re-employed employee was pre-borrowed 30,000 yuan of Beihai currency. Those who were on the job but not yet re-employed and registered were given 30 catties of wheat per person, and those who suffered special living difficulties due to the war were given relief of up to 60 catties of grain. More than 900 people have received relief grain successively, totaling more than 33,000 catties of grain. The Railway Bureau is now vigorously organizing repair and renovation work, striving to restore railway transportation as soon as possible.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 17th: After the liberation of Zhengzhou City, the order is good, and various restoration works are being actively carried out. Employees of Zhengzhou Station of the Pinghan Railway elected seven preparatory committee members on October 25th to form a new preparatory committee of the Pinghan Railway Bureau Trade Union to take over the old railway trade union formerly controlled by the Kuomintang. They are now conducting employee registration, organizing worker pickets, and actively restoring railway transportation. Representatives from various industries in the city's business community established a preparatory committee for the City Chamber of Commerce on the 2nd and resolved to quickly resume business and eliminate counterfeit currency. After the democratic government abolished the Kuomintang's price limit regulations and implemented a free transaction policy, many shops that had closed due to price limits resumed business as usual. All schools in the city were intact under the protection of the People's Liberation Army's city defense forces. As of the first of this month, Henan Provincial Senior Industrial Vocational School, Zhengzhou Middle School, Senior Normal School, as well as private Zhengzhou Women's Middle School, Shengde, Limin, Mingxin and other middle schools and primary schools in the city have successively resumed classes. Zhengzhou News was launched on the 25th of last month. More than 20 bookstores have opened for business, including the Commercial Press old hall, China Bookstore, and World Bookstore. Luo Gengchen and other 14 doctors from Zhengzhou County Hospital have transported the evacuated medicines back and resumed outpatient services. The railway hospitals affiliated to the Longhai and Pinghan railways have begun to provide medical treatment after being taken over by the Military Control Commission. Police, fire brigades, and scavengers who reported to the democratic government have also begun to work one after another.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th: Anshan, Liaoyang, Yingkou and other cities along the South Liaoning Middle-East Railway, which were once occupied by the enemy and recently liberated, have rapidly restored social order. When "Steel Capital" Anshan was liberated, citizens spontaneously organized self-defense forces, protecting public buildings and warehouses day and night, waiting for the democratic government to take over. All 33 primary and secondary schools resumed classes on the 5th, with no students or teachers missing. The citizens of Liaoyang welcomed the democratic government into the city along the streets. Many shops that had "Closed" and "For Sale" signs posted during the enemy occupation have now replaced them with signs indicating the resumption of business. Shops in Yingkou have been cleaning their storefronts and moving out various goods to meet the market demand. City traffic has been fully restored. The Middle-East Railway, which runs through the above three cities, is open to unobstructed train traffic. When the Kuomintang bandit army invaded and occupied the above-mentioned towns, it wantonly looted various businesses. More than 30 agency stores and gold stores in Anshan City were looted, including Fuqinghe, which was looted of 70,000 to 80,000 catties of various grains and other goods worth 1.7 billion Northeast currency.
