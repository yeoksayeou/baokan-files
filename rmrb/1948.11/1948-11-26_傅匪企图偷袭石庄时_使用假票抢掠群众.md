　　Fu Bandit Attempts to Attack Shijiazhuang
  　Uses Fake Currency to Plunder the Masses
　　[North Yue 16th Telegram] When the Chiang Kai-shek-Fu bandit troops attempted to sneak attack Shijiazhuang, they arrested, murdered, and looted property along the way on a large scale. They also deceived and paralyzed the masses by distributing a large number of "propaganda materials." Even more shamelessly, they distributed a large number of small Zhang's fake border currency notes worth 5,000 yuan each, using the fake currency to plunder the people's belongings. In Sanlipu, Wangdu Second District, they ate three large pigs, all paid for with fake border currency. It is estimated that the enemy left behind more than 100 million yuan in fake currency in Wangdu this time. Furthermore, on the 4th of this month, the Wangdu market confiscated 1.13 million yuan in small 5,000 yuan fake notes in a single day. Relevant departments in Wangdu recognized the seriousness of the fake currency problem and convened a joint conference of public security and economic departments on the 6th to organize forces to carry out the fight against fake currency. Specific decisions were made: the urban area would be jointly responsible by various departments, and in major market towns, cadres would be drawn from the bank to organize comparisons and inspections of fake currency. The difference between real and fake currency would be publicized in the markets, exposing the enemy's shameless deception of "public buying and selling," and registering the fake currency received for goods sold to the enemy. A small number of elements intentionally aiding the enemy would have their fake currency confiscated and be given severe punishment.
