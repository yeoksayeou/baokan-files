　　Record of Liao Yaoxiang's Capture
    Liao Yaoxiang was captured on November 6th, the ninth day after his army corps was completely annihilated by the People's Liberation Army in the Dahushan area of western Liaoning. However, even two days later, the bandit Chiang Kai-shek was still proclaiming that he had "died heroically."

    On the evening of November 6th, the logistics department of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, in Zhong'anbu, more than 30 li southwest of Dahushan, was investigating two "southern merchants" dressed in ragged clothes and draped in burlap sacks. One of them, a short, fat man with a slight eye problem and graying temples, speaking with a Hunan accent, could not escape the sharp eyes of the PLA soldiers.

    When questioned, the short, fat man sighed repeatedly and remained silent. After a long time, he claimed to be "Hu Qingxiang" from Dong'an, Hunan, doing business in Shenyang. He repeatedly pleaded: "Ah! Please let me go quickly, I still have an old mother and young children at home!" The PLA soldiers saw that his appearance matched the image of Liao Yaoxiang that they had memorized long ago, and repeatedly asked him to honestly admit it. But he always shook his head and said: "I don't know, how could I be Liao Yaoxiang?"

    After being sent to the guard company, he changed his story, saying his name was "Hu Changjiang," from Xiangtan, Hunan, and was a fellow villager of Xiong Shihui. After coming to the Northeast with Xiong, he worked as a clerk in the Political Committee. Later, he said he had been a traffic policeman for more than twenty years. The health worker of the company, who had been liberated from the Kuomintang army, had seen Liao before. Upon seeing him this time, he pointed at him and asked: "If you're not Liao Yaoxiang, who are you? At the military parade in Xi'an, wasn't it you, Liao 'Blind-eye', who told us about 'suppressing the rebellion and loving the country'?" He immediately turned red, stammered, but still would not admit it. He desperately denied it, saying: "I'm not, I'm not... Liao... I've seen him too, he's about the same as me... but Liao Yaoxiang has a bald head... I'm not fat, I'm stuffing cotton inside this clothes... I'm not, ah! I'm... I'm Hu Qingxiang."

    The matter was already very clear. The guard company decided to transfer him to higher authorities to have prisoners identify him.

    This time, Liao Yaoxiang panicked. He didn't dare to face the liberation soldiers, pulling his hat very low when marching, and blocking his mouth with his sleeves, revealing only a pair of eyes that were hard to see clearly, constantly calling out "It's so cold." On the way, he took advantage of the evening departure and tried to sneak away over the wall. But he was immediately discovered. Then he attempted to use his village kinship to ask the political instructor of the company to release him, saying: "You and I are both from Xiangtan, Hunan, we are fellow villagers, let me go! If you trust me, I guarantee to take a letter home for you."

    On the eleventh, he was transferred to the logistics department. In the evening, when the department's Political Commissar Duan personally questioned him, this "Hu Qingxiang" or "Hu Changjiang" who was sometimes a merchant and sometimes a clerk, obediently lowered his head and admitted,

    "I am Liao Yaoxiang." (Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 24th)

### 廖耀湘就擒记

　　廖耀湘就擒记
    廖耀湘就擒，是在他的兵团在辽西大虎山地区被解放军全歼后的第九天，即十一月六日。但是，两天以后，蒋匪介石还宣传他已“壮烈殉职”。
    十一月六日黄昏，解放军某部后勤部，在大虎山西南三十多里的中安堡，查护两名身穿破衣，肩披麻袋的“南方商人”。其中一个矮胖子，眼有点毛病，鬓发花白，操湖南口音的，首先逃不脱解放军战士的锐利眼睛。
    当被盘问时，矮胖子长吁短叹，一言不发。好久他才自称叫“胡庆祥”，湖南东安人，在沈阳经商。他连声要求：“唉！快放掉我吧，我家还有老母幼子呢！”解放军战士看出他的形象正符合于早就记熟了的廖耀湘的形象，再三要他老老实实地承认。他却总是摇头幌脑只说：“我不晓得，我哪是廖耀湘呢？”
    被送到警卫连后，他又改了口，说他叫“胡长江”，是湖南湘潭人，和熊式辉是乡亲，随熊来东北后，在政委会当办事员。后来又说他干过二十多年交通警察。该连的卫生员是从国民党军被解放过来的，他以前见过廖，这次一见之下，就指着鼻子问他：“你不是廖耀湘是谁？在西安阅兵时，对我们讲什么‘戡乱爱国’的，不就是你廖瞎子吗？”他顿时满脸通红，张口结舌，但还不承认。他胡乱抵赖说：“我不是，我不是，………廖………我也见过，他和我差不多，……但是廖耀湘是秃脑门………，我不是胖子，我这衣服里塞的是棉花，………我不是，唉！我是……我是胡庆祥。”
    事情已经很明显了。警卫连决定把他转送到上级机关去。让俘虏来认他。
    这一下廖耀湘可慌了。他不敢见解放战士，行军时把帽拉得很低，又用袖口堵住嘴，只露一对使人看不清楚的眼睛，连呼“天好冷”。半路上，他趁着晚间出发的机会，打算偷偷爬墙逃跑。但是立即被发觉了。于是他又企图以乡亲关系，要求该连政治指导员放他，说：“你我都是湖南湘潭人，咱是乡亲，放了我吧！你有信我保证给你捎到家。”
    十一日，他被转送到了后勤部。晚上，该部段政委亲自问他时，这个又是商人，又是办事员的“胡庆祥”或“胡长江”，乖乖地低头承认了。
    “我就是廖耀湘”。（新华社沈阳二十四日电）
