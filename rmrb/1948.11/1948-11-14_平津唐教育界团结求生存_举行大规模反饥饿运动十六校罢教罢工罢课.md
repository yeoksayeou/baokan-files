Xinhua News Agency, North China, December 12th. Comprehensive report: In late October, during the time when the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek lingered in Beiping, the education circles of Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan, disregarding the Kuomintang's "Emergency Financial and Economic Decree" of August 19th that prohibited strikes, launched a large-scale strike by teachers, workers, and students to oppose hunger and seek survival. According to statistics from newspapers in Beijing and Tianjin, sixteen colleges and universities, the Beiping Research Institute, and primary and secondary schools in Beijing and Tianjin were involved in this movement. The movement first started in Beijing. All the more than four thousand municipal primary school teachers in the city held a general strike for four days on October 20th, demanding winter coal distribution and the borrowing of two months' salary. Professors at Peking University also began a three-day strike on October 25th, demanding that two months' salary be borrowed within a week to maintain the lives of their families. Lecturers, teaching assistants, staff, graduate students, students, school workers, school police, and doctors from affiliated hospitals immediately responded by holding strikes by teachers, workers, researchers, and doctors. Subsequently, teachers from Tsinghua University, Normal University, Yenching University, Fu Jen University, Sino-French University, Beiping Higher Industrial School, National Beiping First Midwifery School, Beiping Mongolian-Tibetan School, Beiping Research Institute, and all sixteen municipal middle schools in Beiping also joined the struggle. At the same time, faculty and staff of Nankai University, Beiyang University, Institute of Physical Education, Hebei Institute of Technology, Women's Normal College, Aquatic Products College, Tangshan Institute of Technology in Tianjin and Tangshan, as well as middle school teachers in Tianjin, also put forward demands for coal distribution, food distribution, and borrowing of one to three months' salary, and held strikes lasting three to seven days. In addition to issuing declarations and striking to support the just demands of faculty and staff, students in various colleges and universities also established organizations such as "Anti-Hunger and Survival Committee" and "Striving for Warmth and Fullness Committee" to fight for improving their own lives. Students from Peking University, Yenching University, Beiyang University, and other schools have successively petitioned the pseudo-president Chiang Kai-shek, demanding full public funding for all students and food distribution. The "Professors' Association" and "Lecturers, Teaching Assistants, and Staff Union" of some universities in Beijing and Tianjin also conducted liaison with other schools, taking unified steps to fight for the common goal of opposing hunger and striving for survival.

This large-scale anti-hunger movement is the result of the Kuomintang government's policy of freezing the salaries of public employees and implementing a hunger policy after the currency reform. Professors at Peking University pointed out in their strike declaration: "After the currency reform, prices and our salaries have been frozen. Although prices are frozen, we can never buy what we need for food at the fixed price. Therefore, our monthly income can only maintain a few days of life." At a faculty meeting at Tsinghua University, a professor in the Department of Sociology, based on accurate statistics, stated that the average monthly income of all faculty and staff at the school was only eight yuan before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Calculated for a family of four, this could only sustain eight days of food, and the hunger was truly extreme. Students, school workers, and school police suffered even more from the soaring prices. Students at Normal University and other schools ate rice with salt water, and many schools were forced to stop providing meals due to the inability to buy food. School workers and police at Peking University stated that they would beg on the streets with their families.

This just anti-hunger movement in the education circles of Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan has a wider range of participants than previous movements in Beijing and Tianjin. It not only spread throughout the aforementioned colleges and universities in the three cities, but also involved many middle and primary schools. Schools that had not participated or rarely participated in previous anti-hunger movements, such as Beiping Mongolian-Tibetan School, Beiping First Midwifery School, Beiping Research Institute, and Hebei Aquatic Products College, also participated. In previous anti-hunger movements, professors, especially some politically conservative professors, usually took a bystander's attitude or were merely sympathetic. In this anti-hunger movement, they all participated. This shows that the Kuomintang government's reactionary policy of massive inflation and plunder after the currency reform is forcing the people of all strata in its controlled areas to unite for survival step by step.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi. The anti-hunger strikes by teachers, students, and workers in the education circles of Beijing and Tianjin to protest the Kuomintang's reactionary economic measures after the "currency reform" continue to expand. According to a United Press report on October 29th, after the strike by faculty and staff at Nankai University in Tianjin, local middle school teachers have also gone on strike to fight for improved living conditions. Students at Nankai University and Beiyang University began a strike on October 28th. In Beijing, in addition to the three strikes by more than four thousand primary school teachers and the faculty, students, and workers of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Normal University, teaching assistants and lecturers at Yenching University have also joined the strike. Faculty and staff at the Beiping Art School have also proposed demands for borrowing two months' salary and distributing flour and coal, and stated that if there are no results in the short term, they will hold a strike.

　　平津唐教育界团结求生存
    举行大规模反饥饿运动十六校罢教罢工罢课
    【新华社华北十二日电】综合报导：十月下旬，即匪首蒋介石逗留北平期间，平、津、唐山三教育界蔑视国民党八月十九日“财政经济紧急分令”禁止罢业的规定，举行大规模的反饥饿求生存的罢教、罢工、罢课运动。据平、津报纸材料统计，卷入这一运动的有十六个专科以上学校、北平研究院及平、津两地中小学。运动首先纵北平开始，该市全体市立小学教师四千余人，于十月二十日总罢教四天，提出冬季配煤、借薪两月等要求。北大教授亦于十月二十五日起罢教三天，要求在一周内借薪两月，维持家人生活。该校讲师、助教、职员、研究生、学生、校工、校警及附属医院医生立即响应，举行罢教、罢工、罢研、罢诊。接着清华、师大、燕京、辅仁、中法、北平高等工业学校、国立北平第一助产学校、北平蒙藏学校、北平研究院及北平十六个市立中学全体教员，也卷入这一斗争中。与此同时，天津唐山两地之南开、北洋、体专、河北工学院、女师学院、水产专科学校、唐山工学院教职员及津市中学教师，亦纷纷提出配煤、配粮、借薪一月至三月等要求，并举行为期三天至七天的罢教、罢工。各专科以上学校学生，除发表宣言、罢课支持教职员的正义要求外，并纷纷成立“反饥饿争生存委员会”、“争温饱委员会”等组织，为改善本身生活而斗争。北大、燕京、北洋等校学生，曾先后向伪总统蒋介石请愿，要求全校学生公费待遇、配给粮食。平津若干大学教职员工友的“教授会”、“讲师、助教、职工联合会”，亦进行与他校联络，采取一致步骤，为反饥饿争生存的共同目标而斗争。
    这一大规模的反饥饿运动，是国民党政府币改后冻结公教人员薪资实行饥饿政策的结果。北大教授在停课宣言中指出：“改革币制以后，物价和我们薪给被冻结了。物价虽被冻结，我们绝不能照限价购得我们食用所需，因此，我们每月收入不过维持几天的生活。”在清华教授会议上，社会学系某教授根据精确统计数字，调该校全体教职员每月的平均收入仅为抗战前的八元。以一家四口计算，只能维持八天的伙食，饥苦实属空。各校学生、校工校警在物价暴涨中生活尤为痛苦，师大等校学生以盐水下饭，许多学校则因买不到粮食而被迫停伙。北大校工校警表示要随家属沿街行乞。
    这次平、津、唐教育界反饥饿的正义运动，其参加成份较以前平津历次运动更为广泛。不只遍及上述三地的专科以上学校，很多中学、小学也参加了，以前没有参加过或很少参加的北平蒙藏学校、北平第一助产学校、北平研究院、河北水产专科等学校也参加了。在历次反饥饿运动中，教授，特别是一些在政治上比较保守的教授，他们通常是抱旁观或仅仅同情的态度的，在这一次反饥饿运动中，也都参加了。这说明了国民党政府币改后大膨胀、大掠夺的反动政策，一步紧一步地逼使其统治区各阶层人民团结求生。
    【新华社陕北电】平、津教育界为抗议国民党“币改”后反动经济措施的反饥饿罢教、罢课、罢工运动继续扩大。据合众社十月二十九日报导，天津方面继南开大学教职员罢教后，当地中学教师已为争取改善生活待遇而罢教。南开、北洋两大学学生已于十月二十八日开始罢课。北平方面除四千余小学教师及北大、清华、师大三大学教职员、学生、工友所举行的三罢尚在继续外，燕大助教、讲师亦已参加罢教。北平艺专教职员亦提出贷薪两月及配给面粉与煤等要求，并表示若短期无结果即举行罢教。
