Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 11th: Mr. Zeng Ciliang, a veteran educator from Henan and Director of the Henan Provincial Annals Compilation Committee, and his family arrived safely in a certain area of the Western Henan Liberated Area on October 14th. He was extremely happy that his long-cherished wish had been fulfilled and enthusiastically said to others: For more than 20 years, I have lived in an environment devoid of spiritual freedom, and my mind has never been as open and joyful as it is now. In the past, education in Henan Province suffered particularly severely from the fascist secret service's control. Young people were poisoned, and educational workers with a bit of conscience were subjected to rejection and surveillance. Now, the cultural and educational circles and young people in Henan Province urgently need democratic and free New Democratic culture for education and cultivation. Mr. Zeng highly praised the construction in various liberated areas and the various policies of the Chinese Communist Party, and put forward many suggestions for education work.

　　河南老教育家曾次亮抵豫西
    【新华社中原十一日电】河南老教育家、河南省通志编审委员会主任曾次亮先生及其家属，已于十月十四日安抵豫西解放区某地，他以素愿得偿，分外高兴，热情地对人说：我二十多年来生活在失去精神自由的环境里，胸襟从来没有象现在这样的开放和愉快过。河南省教育过去受法西斯特务统治特别凶狠，青年受毒化，稍有良心的教育工作者备受排斥、监视。现在河南省文化教育界和青年们，正需要民主自由的新民主主义的文化来教育和培养。曾先生盛赞解放区各地的建设和中共的各种政策，并对教育工作提出许多建议。
