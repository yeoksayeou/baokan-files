　　Cooperating with the Japanese Communist Party to Strive for the Realization of Socialism
  　The Japan Workers' and Farmers' Party Will Be Established
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th】Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Twenty members of the Japanese Diet who broke away from the Socialist Party or were expelled from the Socialist Party due to their left-leaning tendencies will continue to form the new Japan Workers' and Farmers' Party, which will be formally established here this month. Member of Parliament Makoto Hori stated: The new party will cooperate with the Communist Party through the recently organized League for the Defense of Democracy to strive for the realization of socialism in Japan and for world peace. The Japanese Communist Party, left-wing socialists, and many other progressive groups have joined the League for the Defense of Democracy. The Japanese Socialist Party has become increasingly reactionary due to its support for MacArthur's anti-labor measures and policies that support monopoly capitalists.
