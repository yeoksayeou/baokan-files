  　Recovers Tanghe and Biyang Southeast of Nanyang
    Kaifeng People Welcome Our Army with the Sentiment of Old Friends
    Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 8th: The important city of Shangqiu in eastern Henan was liberated by our army on the morning of the 6th. The defending enemy, the 181st Division of the 55th Army and security regiments, etc., abandoned the city and fled east. More than 1,000 fleeing enemies from the 5th Regiment of the 1st Security Brigade of the puppet Henan Province were routed by our army. At the same time, Zhu Ji, a station on the Longhai Railway 20 miles north of the city, and Mamuji, a station 50 miles northeast of the city, were also liberated. Before the enemy fled Shangqiu, they carried out large-scale looting, and the citizens hated them to the bone. When our army entered the city, the citizens held flags and lined the streets to welcome them. Shangqiu is located between Kaifeng and Xuzhou, with the city on the south side of the Longhai Railway, formerly known as Guide Prefecture. It is located at the intersection of the four provinces of Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui. In addition to the Longhai Railway running east-west, there are also highways connecting to Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Gunzhou, and Bengbu, making it an important military town in eastern Henan. The Second Corps Headquarters of Qiu Qingquan's bandit army and the Fourth Pacification Zone Headquarters of Liu Ruming's bandit army have both been stationed there. Since our army liberated Zhengzhou on the 22nd of last month, the two flanks of Xuzhou, the first important military center on the southern line of the Kuomintang, have been extremely panicked. Sun Yuanliang's army corps and Liu Ruming's 55th Army, 68th Army, and other bandit units fled east overnight. Our army recovered Kaifeng and Lanfeng on the 24th, and now has liberated Shangqiu. The enemy army is now centered on Xuzhou, extending north to Lincheng, south to Bengbu, west to Dangshan, and east to Xin'anzhen. In this narrow rhomboid area, four army corps are huddled together, including 20 armies, 46 divisions, and 350,000 people. In addition, several armies in the Hankou area are now being transferred towards the Xuzhou area.
    Sui Meng Front, 8th: (Delayed) A unit of the People's Liberation Army liberated Guyang County in western Sui on the 27th of last month. The defending enemy fled at the mere sight of our forces. Guyang is located 90 li south of Baotou, and is an important location for traveling north from Baotou to Bailingmiao, the former political and religious center of the Mongol banners. The county is traversed by the main line of the Daqing Mountains, and is believed to have mineral deposits such as asbestos and crystal.
    Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan, 8th: Simultaneously with the liberation of Nanyang, an important town in southwestern Henan, a unit of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army recovered the two county towns of Tanghe, 100 li southeast of the city, and Biyang, about 150 li southeast of the city, on the 3rd and 4th. Huang Wei's bandit army's three convoys fled eastward. Furthermore: On the 4th, when the Liberation Army pursued Wang Lingyun's fleeing enemy from Nanyang, they killed and wounded more than 500 of his troops in the Xixindian area of Wolonggang, southwest of Nanyang.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 8th: Delayed news from Kaifeng, October 30th: The people of Kaifeng, the re-liberated capital of Henan Province, warmly welcome the Liberation Army with the sentiment of old friends. After the Liberation Army entered the city on the 24th of last month, it immediately convened chambers of commerce, etc., to form a public security committee. The workers at the Kaifeng Station of the Longhai Railway immediately organized and began to resume work. Most of the students in secondary schools and above remained in school and will resume classes within days. The students are extremely affectionate towards the Liberation Army and have expressed their willingness to help the Liberation Army in various tasks. Professor Lu Feiran, MD, of the Medical College of Henan University, said that he had properly protected the valuable equipment and medicines of the college. People from all walks of life enthusiastically participated in various forums convened separately by the democratic government. Two-thirds of the police in the city, from the sub-bureau chief down, have reported to the democratic government and have been ordered to continue to maintain order.
