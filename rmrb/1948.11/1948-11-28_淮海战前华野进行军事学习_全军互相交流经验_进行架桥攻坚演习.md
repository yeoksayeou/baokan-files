Xinhua News Agency, Huaihai Front, 24th -- Before the Huaihai Campaign, under Chairman Mao’s great call to "Advance the Army Forward," the entire East China Field Army enthusiastically engaged in military training. The troops engaged in external operations learned from the troops who had persisted in internal operations in Shandong for the past year, focusing on experiences in fortification assault, communication, and infantry-artillery coordination. The internal troops learned from the external troops regarding field operations, village warfare, defensive warfare, and rapid response. The infantry and artillery also studied how to strengthen coordinated operations. The artillery further established the idea of serving the infantry. Infantry commanders further studied the performance of artillery and learned how to correctly use artillery. In the learning process, various units corrected some ideas lacking organization and discipline. A certain regimental commander reviewed his past mistake of complaining about the "sudden orders to enter battle" without prior notification from his superiors, recognizing the need to serve the entire campaign in the future, to be prepared for battle at all times, to be able to enter battle at any time, and to not be afraid of continuous operations. To specifically prepare for the Huaihai Campaign, the entire army also widely studied river warfare and river fortification assault warfare, and each company conducted exercises such as bridging and fortification assault. The Second Battalion of the Ninth Regiment of a certain column practiced attacking a watery village, with the assault squad jumping into a ditch one zhang deep and fifteen meters wide to cover the bridging. The bridging team erected a 17-meter-long pontoon bridge in a river with water too deep to touch the bottom in just four minutes. During the learning process, the various units greatly promoted military democracy, and tactics, technology, and command were greatly improved and innovated.

　　淮海战前华野进行军事学习
    全军互相交流经验
  　进行架桥攻坚演习
    【新华社淮海前线二十四日电】此次淮海战役前，华东野战军全军在毛主席“军队向前进”的伟大号召下，曾热烈进行军事学习。外线出击的部队这次都向一年来坚持山东内线作战的部队学习攻坚、通讯联络、步炮协同等经验。内线部队则向外线部队学习野战、村落战、防御战、迅速应战等经验。步兵与炮兵间也研究了如何加强协同作战。炮兵进一步树立了为步兵服务的思想。步兵指挥员也进一步研究了炮的性能，学习了如何正确地运用炮兵。各部队在学习中纠正了一些无组织、无纪律的思想。某团长即检讨了过去对上级指挥不预先通知“忽来命令投入战斗”表示埋怨的错误，认识了今后要服务整个战役的要求，平时应作好战斗准备，以便能随时投入战斗，不怕连续作战。为具体准备淮海战役，全军又曾普遍学习了河川战和河川攻坚战，每个连都进行了架桥，攻坚等演习。某纵队九团二营演习进攻水圩子，突击班跳入深一丈、宽十五米的河沟掩护架桥。架桥组在水深不及底的河上仅以四分钟就架好了一长十七米的浮桥。各部队在学习中大大发扬了军事民主，战术、技术和指挥都获得很多改进和创造。
