    To launch future literary and artistic work throughout the Taihang region, the Taihang District Party Committee convened a symposium on literary and artistic work on the 7th of this month. Participants included comrades from the Taihang Literary Federation such as Gao Muhong, Hong Huang, Wang Yutang, Ma Yinqiu, Zhao Fengchuan, and Han Sheng, as well as all staff members of the District Party Committee's Propaganda Department. Leading comrades of the Party Committee were present to give specific instructions. First, Comrade Hong Huang conveyed the spirit of the North China Literary and Artistic Symposium held in August and Comrade Zhou Yang's report. Subsequently, Comrade Gao Muhong, Director of the Literary Federation, spoke, reviewing the Literary Federation's policies and work over the past two years and proposing a work plan for the future. Following this, Comrade Lai Ruoyu, Secretary of the District Party Committee, gave instructions on the future direction and tasks of the entire region's cultural front, pointing out that the Taihang cultural work has achieved great success in the past few years. The literary magazines have been run well, producing many works and nurturing some new writers, all of which must be affirmed. Today, the revolutionary situation requires our writers and literary and artistic workers to shoulder even greater tasks, serving the current construction of the New Democratic state and the victory of the Liberation War. To this end, we must further strive to improve the political awareness of cadres and the masses through literary and artistic forms: (1) War education and current affairs education, so that cadres and the masses can see the future. (2) Democratic education: both opposing coercion and commandism, and opposing extreme democracy. (3) Encouraging mass production, especially organized production. Regarding methods, he pointed out that the Literary Federation must first vigorously lead the launch of a mass literary and artistic movement throughout the region, and creation should be carried out in the movement.

    During the symposium, Comrade Leng Chu, Deputy Secretary of the District Party Committee, and Comrade Tao Lujia, Minister of the Organization Department, also spoke. Comrade Tao Lujia believed that there are many mass creations and should be supported and helped. The masses need short pieces, and the content of the works should be lighter and more pleasant. Comrade Leng Chu pointed out that recently, old dramas have been on the rise, while new dramas have declined. The reason is that the drama movement is weak, and there are few new dramas, which cannot meet the needs of the masses. He called on literary and artistic workers to find typical examples from the production of a large number of works; if typical examples are not produced, it will limit oneself. The drama movement must seek quality from quantity. He finally encouraged everyone, saying: Creation must have a spirit of perseverance, and the tenacity of Lenin, and don't be afraid to revise it ten times.

    In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over the cultural movement, the District Party Committee decided to establish a Cultural Committee within the Party, rename the Literary Federation as the Literary Association, and divide the Literary Association into a Fine Arts Department, an Editorial Department, and a Drama Work Committee. The Fine Arts Department will establish a Fine Arts Factory, the Editorial Department will edit literary magazines, and the Drama Work Committee will lead the region's drama movement.

    开展群众性文艺运动
    太行召开文艺工作座谈会
    【太行电】太行区党委为开展今后全区文艺工作，特于本月七日召开文艺工作座谈会。到会有太行文联高沐鸿、洪荒、王玉堂、马印秋、赵枫川、寒声等同志暨区党委宣传部全体工作人员，党委诸同志均亲临具体指示。首由洪荒同志传达八月华北文艺座谈会的精神和周扬同志的报告。继由文联主任高沐鸿同志发言，检查两年来文联的方针和工作，并提出今后工作方案。随后区党委书记赖若愚同志对今后全区文化战线的方针任务提出指示。指出过去数年来太行文化工作是有很大成绩的，文艺杂志办得不坏，产生了不少作品，新生长了一些作家，这都是必须肯定的。今天革命形势要求我们的作家和文艺工作者担负起更大的任务，为当前的新民主主义国家建设和解放战争的胜利服务。为此，就必须进一步努力提高干部、群众的政治觉悟。通过文艺形式进行：（一）战争教育和时事教育，使干部群众看到前途。（二）民主教育：既反对强迫命令，又要反对极端民主。（三）鼓励群众生产。特别是组织起来生产。关于作法问题，指出：文联首先必须大力领导开展全区群众性的文艺运动，创作应在运动中进行。
    在座谈中，区党委副书记冷楚同志，组织部长陶鲁笳同志均曾发言。鲁笳同志认为：群众创作很多，应加以扶植与帮助。群众需要短篇东西，作品内容要轻松愉快一些。冷楚同志指出：近来旧剧抬头，新剧下降。其原因是剧运软弱，新剧少，不能满足群众要求。号召文艺工作者多从大量作品的产生中找到典型，如非典型不产，则会限制自己。剧运要从量上去求质。他最后勉励大家说：创作须要有坚持精神，要有列宁的顽强性，不要怕成十次的修正。
    为了加强党对文化运动的领导，区党委决定在党内成立文委会，文联改为文协，文协下分美术部、编辑部及戏剧工作委员会。美术部下设美术工厂，编辑部编辑文艺杂志，戏剧工作委员会领导全区戏剧运动。
