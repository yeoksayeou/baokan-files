Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th - Delayed news from Baotou: Influenced by the victorious momentum of the People's Liberation Army on all fronts, Qi Zhizhong, commander of the Jungar Banner Security Division of the Inner Mongolia Ikzhao League and concurrently Chairman of the Jungar Banner Affairs Committee, led 1,935 troops in an uprising on the 5th of this month at their garrison, joining the People's Liberation Army. They brought with them 830 mules and horses, 1,000 rifles, and 11 light machine guns. Qi himself has arrived in Baotou to meet with the leaders of the People's Liberation Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 14th - Qi Zhizhong's troops, who revolted in the Yi Meng, have issued a declaration of breaking away from the Kuomintang army and joining the People's Liberation Army. The original text is as follows: For more than 20 years, the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs have ruled the Yi Meng, forcibly establishing administrations and counties, reclaiming land and immigrating people, and dispatching special agents and henchmen to infringe on rights and seize power, and brutally killing progressives. They sowed discord, causing the Yi Meng banners to disintegrate, in order to carry out their heinous rule of Great Han chauvinism and extinguish the Mongolian policy. The Mongolian banners were originally barren and the people were poor. The harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies of the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandits were tantamount to squeezing the marrow from the bones, resulting in shrinking pastures and sparse livestock. Princes and nobles wandered, and the common people suffered from hunger and cold. Zhizhong and his subordinate Mongolian brothers witnessed the elders in the banner in dire straits, and everyone was heartbroken. In addition, they were treated cruelly by the Fu bandits, with meager clothing and food, and incomplete armaments. The lower-level officers and soldiers had long complained, and for several years, they hesitated and struggled without a way out. Fortunately, the Liberation Army launched an autumn offensive, sweeping across the land, and the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit army fled in panic. The people cheered, and Zhizhong and his subordinates demanded to break away from the rule of the Fu bandits and join the Liberation Army. Zhizhong and others also realized that following the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandits would not only obliterate their conscience and betray the hopes of our Mongolian compatriots, but also be accomplices, leading only to death. The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army are the saviors of the liberation of small and weak nations, which has long been deeply understood by our Mongolian people. Weighing the situation, today is truly a golden opportunity for the complete liberation of our Mongolian people and the rebirth of Zhizhong and others. Therefore, we obeyed the will of the people and decided to lead our troops in an uprising. From now on, under the leadership of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Chairman Yun of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, we will listen to the command of the North China People's Liberation Army, completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandits and their special agents and henchmen, and fight to the end for the liberation of the Mongolian nation and all Chinese compatriots. Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu! Long live Chairman Yun! Long live the liberation of the Mongolian and Han people!
   Qi Zhizhong and his troops kowtowed together, November 6th

Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 14th - Commander Qi Zhizhong, who revolted in the Jungar Banner of the Ikzhao League, recently came to Baotou from his garrison to meet with the responsible authorities of the People's Liberation Army. Qi made the following statement to reporters in Baotou: The Liberation Army is growing stronger every day, and its brilliant achievements have made us see the future of China more clearly. The officers and soldiers of my unit are all Mongolian, and they have all suffered discrimination from the Kuomintang. We are treated poorly. In name, it is a division, but we don't even have mortars or heavy machine guns. Fu Zuoyi claimed to give our troops firearms, but he wanted us to exchange them for horses. A rifle was one horse, and a machine gun was four horses. We didn't have horses, so we didn't get anything. The supplies for our troops and horses are entirely up to us to figure out. The Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gang is not responsible for anything. For military uniforms, no matter how many people there are, only 400 sets are issued each season. Not to mention anything else, just the "free ride" policy, the Kuomintang army can do it, but we are not qualified. Because of this, the lower-level officers and soldiers of my unit complained and demanded to break away from Fu Zuoyi and join the Liberation Army. I have realized that there is only one way out. If you want to straddle two boats, you will eventually have your legs split. From now on, I am determined to oppose Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi to the end under the leadership and command of the Liberation Army.

　　伊盟准噶尔旗保安司令　奇致中率部起义
    【新华社陕北十四日电】包头迟到消息：在人民解放军各线胜利声威影响下，内蒙伊克昭盟准噶尔旗保安师师长兼准噶尔旗旗务委员会主任委员奇致中司令率部一千九百三十五名，于本月五日在驻地起义，参加解放军。携来骡马八百三十匹，步枪一千支，轻机枪十一挺。奇本人已抵包头谒见人民解放军首长。
    【新华社包头十四日电】在伊盟起义之奇致中部，顷发表脱离国民党军投奔解放军的宣言，原文如下：蒋傅匪帮统治伊盟二十余年，强令设治、设县，垦地移民，并派遣特务爪牙，侵权夺政，惨杀进步人士；挑拨离间，使伊盟各旗分崩离析，以遂其大汉族主义灭蒙政策之罪恶统治。蒙旗本来地瘠民贫，蒋傅匪苛杂剥削，无异敲骨吸髓，以致牧野日蹙，牲畜稀零，王公流徙，庶民饥寒。致中等所部蒙旗子弟，目睹旗中父老处于水深火热之中，莫不痛心疾首，加之受傅匪虐待，衣单食寡，武备不全。下级官兵早已怨声载道，数年来，徘徊犹豫、苦无出路；幸解放大军展开秋季攻势，所向披靡，蒋傅匪军闻风逃窜，人民欢欣鼓舞，致中等所部纷纷要求脱离傅匪统治投奔解放军。致中等亦鉴于追随蒋傅匪徒，不仅泯灭良心，有负我蒙古同胞的厚望；且为虎作伥，只有死路一条；而中国共产党与人民解放军是弱小民族解放的救星，早为我们蒙人所深晓。权衡形势，今日实乃我蒙族彻底解放及致中等再生之千载良机。于是服从众意，决心率部起义。今后愿在共产党、毛主席、朱总司令、内蒙自治政府云主席的领导下，从听华北人民解放军的指挥，彻底消灭蒋傅匪徒及其特务爪牙，为蒙古民族及全中国同胞的解放事业奋斗到底。毛主席万岁！朱总司令万岁！云主席万岁！蒙汉人民解放万岁！
    奇致中率部同叩十一月六日
    【新华社包头十四日电】在伊克昭盟准噶尔旗起义的奇致中司令日前由驻地来包头谒见人民解放军负责当局。奇氏在包头对记者发表谈话如下：解放军天天壮大，战绩辉煌，使我们对于中国前途看得更清楚了。我部官兵，都是蒙旗人，同受国民党歧视，待自菲薄，名义上是一个师，却连迫击炮、重机枪都没有。傅作义口称发给我部枪械，却要我们拿马去换，步枪是一匹马一支，机枪是四匹马一挺。我们没有马，结果甚也没发。我军人马给养，完全由自己想办法，蒋傅匪帮概不负责，军衣不论多少人，每季只发四百套。不说别的，只说“免费乘车”这一点，国民党军可以办到，但我们却没资格。因之我部下级官兵，怨声载道，纷纷要求脱离傅匪，投奔解放军。我已认清，出路只有一条，如想脚踏两只船，终久要被劈烂腿的。今后决心在解放军的领导指挥下，反蒋反傅到底。
