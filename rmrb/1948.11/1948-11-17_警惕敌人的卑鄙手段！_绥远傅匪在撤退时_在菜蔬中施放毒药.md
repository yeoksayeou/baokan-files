　　Beware of the Enemy's Vile Tricks!
　　Fu Bandit Troops in Suiyuan
　　Poisoned Vegetables During Retreat
    [Sui-Mongol Front Dispatch] The frenzied Fu Zuoyi bandit troops actually ordered their subordinates to poison leftover food and vegetables during their retreat, plotting to harm our army and people with this vile method. On the 21st of last month, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, in the Dahei River and Jiajiaying area south of Guihua City, suffered over 130 cases of poisoning from eating white flour and cabbage left behind by the fleeing Fu bandit troops. One person died despite emergency treatment due to severe poisoning. This vicious behavior of the Fu bandit troops should arouse vigilance everywhere.

　　警惕敌人的卑鄙手段！
    绥远傅匪在撤退时
  　在菜蔬中施放毒药
    【绥蒙前线电】丧心病狂的傅匪作义，竟令其部下于撤退时，在遗留之食粮、菜蔬中施放毒药。阴谋以此种卑鄙手段毒害我军民。上月二十一日，解放军某部于归绥城南之大黑河、贾家营一带，因食吃傅匪逃窜时遗留之白面、白菜，有一百三十余人中毒，其中一人因中毒太深，赶治无效而牺牲。傅匪此种毒辣行为应引起各地警惕。
