　　Li Shunda Summarizes the Experience of Getting Rich
  　Renews the Second Five-Year Plan
    [Taihang News] Li Shunda, a first-class labor hero of Taihang in Xigou, Pingshun, has completed and exceeded the five-year production and construction plan through nearly three years of hard work. In order to summarize experience and continue to develop construction, Shunda and his family discussed it and invited more than 30 people, including the county head, branch secretary, district head, and labor heroes Guo Shuanglong and Guo Yu'en, to participate in the summary, exchange experiences, and study his second five-year plan.
    On the afternoon of November 2nd, heroes from various places arrived one after another. As soon as we entered Xigou, we saw Li Shunda's newly built three-room eastern building and new gate tower this spring. The gate tower was engraved with four eye-catching characters "Starting a Family Through Labor." The south shed was full of complete sets of farming tools for cultivating the land, including two-legged seed drills, three-legged seed drills, plows, harrows, hoes, rakes, and choppers. Shunda and his mother hurriedly welcomed the guests into the east building. In the middle of the building hung portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, with couplets on both sides that read "We owe our liberation entirely to Chairman Mao, and our victory entirely to Commander-in-Chief Zhu."锦旗banners given by the Taihang District Party Committee and other agencies, such as "Organize to Overcome Machines," "New Top Scholar of Getting Rich," "Top Scholar," and "The Direction of the People of Pingshun," covered the whole family, which was a summary of Shunda's achievements over the years. The west room also hung silk banners such as "Textile Hero" and "Textile to Get Rich," which were the achievements of Shunda's mother. Labor heroes from various villages praised Shunda's construction achievements and celebrated his completion of the five-year plan in three years. The Bayin Society of Yangwei Village also came to participate. The Pingshun County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the county government sent silk banners to celebrate. The county committee's congratulatory message wrote: "Firmly believe in the Party's policies, rely on long-term plans, have a democratic and harmonious family, and organize production. This is the direction for farmers." These few words succinctly summarized Shunda's experience in getting rich.
    On the morning of the 3rd, County Head Zhao arrived early to participate. Heroes and the entire masses participated in moving the plaque, and the "Labor Hero" gold plaque awarded by the Second People's Hero Congress was hung on the new gate tower. Then, everyone held a meeting to summarize Shunda's achievements and experiences in completing the plan ahead of schedule, and also discussed his second five-year production and construction plan. The main items of the plan are: Next year (1949), continue to complete the kiln repair. In 1950, build three more storage rooms, where crops can be stored on cloudy and rainy days. In 1951, build two mill sheds, so that men and animals can grind grain on rainy days. Also, build a toilet and repair a toilet. Take time to build a road under the village and plant ten acres of forest. Turn all the uncultivable slopes into trees. Develop the flock of sheep enough for one person to herd. Now there are two female donkeys. Exchange one for a female horse, and replace the other two with foals, and feed a pig every year.
    At the same time, a production plan for this winter was also formulated, mainly for coal transportation and weaving. Strive to transport 5,000 catties of coal this winter. In addition to burning it for ten months, strive to earn 60 catties of salt and 10 catties of cotton.
    The heroes discussed this plan and said it was very practical. With the experience of the previous plan and a solid foundation, as long as they worked hard, they would surely exceed it. Guo Shuanglong said: "Some people say that our place is not good, it is a poor mountain, but I say it is a treasure mountain, as long as you work hard, you can get rich." Zhang Jianfu said: "This is indeed a treasure, go back and promote it well, and lead the masses to follow Shunda's direction." (Chang Qun, Xiao Cheng)

　　李顺达总结发家经验
  　续订第二个五年计划
    【太行讯】平顺西沟太行一等劳动英雄李顺达，经将近三年的努力，完成并超过了五年生产发家建设计划。为总结经验继续发展建设，顺达和全家作了讨论，并请县长、分书、区长及劳动英雄郭双龙、郭玉恩等共三十余人，参加总结，交流经验，并研究他的第二个五年计划。
    十一月二号下午，各地英雄陆续到达。一进西沟，远远就瞧见了李顺达今春新盖起的三间东楼和新门楼，门楼刻着“劳动起家”四个鲜艳夺目的大字，南厦棚挂满了耕种土地的全套农具，有两条腿耧，有三条腿耧及犁耙耢锄钯砍等。顺达和他娘赶忙把客人迎进了东楼。楼正中间挂着毛主席朱总司令的像，像两边又贴着“翻身全凭毛主席，胜利全靠朱司令”的对联。太行区党委等机关赠给的“组织起来顶机器”、“发家致富新状元”、“头名状元”、“平顺人民的方向”等锦旗布满了全家，这是顺达几年来的功绩总结。西房里也挂着“纺织英雄”、“纺织致富”等锦旗，这是顺达母亲的功绩。各村来的劳英，都称赞顺达建设成绩，庆祝他五年计划三年完成。杨威村的八音会也赶来参加。中共平顺县委会和县政府送锦旗庆祝，县委的贺词中写着：“坚信党的政策，依托长期计划，家庭民主和睦，组织起来生产，这是农民的方向。”这几句话，扼要的总结了顺达发家的经验。
    三号的早上，赵县长起早赶来参加，英雄和全体群众参加移匾，把二届群英大会奖给的“劳动英雄”金字匾，悬挂在新门楼上。接着，大家开会，总结顺达提早完成计划的成绩与经验，又讨论了他第二个五年生产发家建设计划。计划的主要项目是：明年（四九年）继续完成修窑。五○年再盖三间场房，天阴雨能放庄稼，五一年盖碾棚两间，下雨天男人和畜力都能推碾，再打一个厕所，修理一个厕所，抽空在庄下修一条大路，要造十亩林。把不能种的坡地全部养成树，羊群发展够一个人放，现在有两头母驴，用一头倒换成一匹母马，两头替换下驹，年年喂猪一口。
    同时也订出了今年冬季生产计划，主要是驮煤纺织。争取一冬驮五千斤煤，除自己十个月烧燃外，争取赚盐六十斤，棉花十斤。
    各位英雄讨论了这个计划，都说很实际，有了前一个计划的经验，家又有了底垫，只要努力一定超过。郭双龙说：“有人说咱这地方不好，是穷山，我说是宝山，只要出力，就能发家”。张建福说：“眼见是宝，回去好好宣传，领导群众来走顺达方向。”（长群、效诚）
