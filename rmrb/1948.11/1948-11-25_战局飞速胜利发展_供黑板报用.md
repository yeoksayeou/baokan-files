　　Rapid and Victorious Development of the War Situation
  　For Blackboard Newspapers
    On November 6th and 7th, the People's Liberation Army launched an offensive in the Huaihai area, encircling Xuzhou from all sides. In just half a month, they have already annihilated eighteen divisions of the Chiang bandit army. Huang Botao's entire army corps of five armies has been completely wiped out. Many county towns and railway stations have also been liberated and recovered, occupying hundreds of miles of railway, and also seizing the important military port of Lianyungang. The rapid liberation of the entire Northeast has greatly accelerated the liberation of all of China; this battle of Xuzhou has been fought so well that it has a very significant impact on the entire war, and the victorious offensive is still continuing to develop. On the 12th, the Northeast recovered Chengde, the provincial capital of Rehe, and the entire province of Rehe was also liberated. On the 22nd, the North China People's Liberation Army occupied Baoding, the provincial capital of Hebei. Since the autumn offensive, the People's Liberation Army has occupied five provincial capitals. Taiyuan will also be captured soon. The several airports south, north, and west of the city are all under our army's control, and enemy planes dare not land. In the past few days, another Japanese army brigade and a regiment have surrendered to us. We are winning victories in many other places as well. The victorious day of liberating all of China is very near. A central person in charge of the Chinese Communist Party issued a very important commentary on the 14th, pointing out that the People's Liberation Army already has more than three million troops, and the number of troops is also more than Chiang Kai-shek's army; in no more than a year or so, the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang can be fundamentally overthrown. We in the rear should work hard to produce and do our jobs well, and good men should bravely join the army and support the front!

　　战局飞速胜利发展
  　供黑板报用
    十一月六、七号，解放军在淮海地区发动进攻，四面合围徐州。半月光景，已经消灭了蒋匪十八个整师，黄伯韬兵团全部五个军叫消灭了个净光。还解放和收复了许多县城、火车站，占了铁路几百里，还占了重要军港连云港。全东北的迅速解放，使全中国解放大大加速；徐州这一仗打得这么好，对整个战争影响也非常重大，胜利攻势还在继续发展中。东北在十二号收复了热河省城承德，热河全省也解放了。二十二号，华北解放军占领了河北省城保定。秋季攻势以来，解放军已占了五座省城。太原城也很快的就会打下来，城南城北城西几个飞机场，都被我军控制住，敌机不敢降落了。这些天，日军又有一个总队、一个团向咱投诚。别的很多地方，咱们都在打胜仗。解放全中国的胜利日子已经很近了。中国共产党中央负责人在十四号发表了一个很重要的评论，指出解放军已经有了三百多万，在人数上也比蒋介石军队多了；再有不过一年左右时间，就能把国民党的反动统治从根本上打倒了。我们在后方应该努力生产，做好工作，好男儿要勇敢参军支前！
