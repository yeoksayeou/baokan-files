Xinhua News Agency, East China, 2nd. Due to widespread propaganda of land policies, burden policies, and the current situation in various parts of the Jiaodong area, coupled with government assistance and the active leadership of district and village cadres, autumn cultivation and planting were largely completed by the Cold Dew solar term (October 8th); the land of military families and families of laborers were also mostly sown in a timely manner. The area sown with wheat in the entire region has surpassed last year and has reached pre-war levels. In mountainous areas, the area sown with wheat generally exceeds one-third of the cultivated land; Qixia County, which can represent the general mountainous area of Jiaodong, has 670,000 mu of cultivated land. Last year, over 140,000 mu were planted with wheat, and this year, more than 200,000 mu have been planted. In the plains of Nan'ye (County), Bei'ye (County), Northern Wei (County), Longkou, and Huangxian counties, more than one-half are sown. In Huatuan District of Northern Wei County, the area sown with wheat exceeds seven-tenths of last year's. In terms of intensive cultivation and fertilization, the situation is generally better than last year. This is particularly significant in the eastern coastal counties, where, generally, 20 cartloads of fertilizer are applied per mu, and even the lesser amount is 15 cartloads. Wheat fields have been universally hoed. In Pingdu West County, half of the 300,000 mu of wheat fields have been hoed, turned, or plowed twice.

This year, in most villages in the Jiaodong area, during the autumn harvest, from within the Party to outside the Party, education on land policies and burden policies was conducted extensively and deeply. The current victorious situation was also publicized, and erroneous ideas such as "poverty is glorious" were criticized, initially establishing in the minds of peasants the concept of becoming wealthy through labor and developing their families through production. At the same time, Party and government leading organs in most areas preemptively prevented cadres' and Party members' complacency and corrected the erroneous understanding that "production does not need leadership." Branches led peasants in cultivation with more planning and organization. Before the autumn cultivation and planting, the Jiaodong Administrative Office also lent 8 million jin of wheat seeds, 10 million jin of wheat fertilizer and farm tools, and North Sea currency worth 200 million yuan for livestock, partially resolving the difficulties faced by peasants in obtaining seeds, fertilizer, farm tools, and livestock during autumn planting. As a result, the peasants' enthusiasm for production greatly increased. They plowed while harvesting during the busy autumn harvest season, and many toiled diligently, under the stars and moon. In Qianliujia Village, Liangmu District, Pingdu County, six out of eleven mutual aid teams plowed the land under the moonlight. In Changle District, Ping (du) West County, more than 20,000 mu of wheat land were all sown 20 days before the Cold Dew solar term. After Han Shoujing's mutual aid team in Qiushandian Village, Penglai County, proposed a competition, team member Wang Yongxi got up in the middle of the night to deliver manure and had made thirteen trips by dawn. After conducting education on becoming wealthy through labor, Quan’guo District of that county, which originally planned to sow 31,980 mu of wheat, increased the sowing area by more than 800 mu. Fushui District of Lai (yang) East County increased the area sown with wheat by 10,000 big mu (equivalent to 30,000 mu) after receiving autumn loans. Seven hundred peasant households in Changle District of Ping (du) West County, lacking production materials, successfully sowed their land after receiving 15,000 jin of wheat seeds and 5,000 jin of bean cakes loaned by the government.

　　广泛宣传政策时局加强领导
  　胶东各地秋耕秋种寒露节已大体完成
    【新华社华东二日电】胶东区各地，由于广泛宣传土地政策、负担政策和目前时局，加上政府帮助与区村干部的积极领导，秋耕秋种至寒露节（十月八日）已大体完成；军工烈属和民工家属的地也都大部适时下种。全区种麦面积超过去年，并已达到战前水平。山区种麦一般都超过耕地面积的三分之一；可代表胶东一般山区的栖霞县，共有耕地六十七万亩，去年种麦十四万余亩，今年种了二十万亩以上。南掖（县）、北掖（县）、潍（县）北、龙口、黄县等县平原均种二分之一以上；潍北县华疃区一个区种麦面积即超过去年的十分之七。在精耕和施肥方面，一般也较去年好。东海各县尤为显著，每亩一般上粪廿驮，少的也有十五驮。普遍都刨过麦地。平（度）西全县三十万亩麦田中，半数刨过、翻过或耕过两遍。
    今年胶东区大部村庄在秋收中，从党内到党外，都广泛而深入地进行了土地政策和负担政策的教育，并宣传了目前胜利形势，批判了所谓“穷光荣”等错误思想，在农民中初步树立了劳动致富、生产发家的观念。同时大部地区党政领导机关预先防止了干部、党员的自满麻痹思想和纠正了以为“生产不用领导”的错误认识。支部更有计划、有组织地领导农民耕种。在秋耕秋种前，胶东行政公署又贷放麦种八百万斤、麦肥及农具一千万斤，牲畜贷款北海币二亿元，部分地解决了农民在秋种中种籽、肥料、农具和牲畜的困难。因此农民的生产积极性大增，在繁忙的秋收季节中边割边耕，且有很多披星戴月奋力耕作。平度县两目区前刘家村十一个互助组中，有六个组月下耕地。平（度）西县长乐区二万余亩麦地，寒露前廿天即全部种完。蓬莱县邱山店村韩守敬互助组提出竞赛后，组员王永喜半夜就起来送粪，到天亮已送了十三趟。该县全果区原计划种麦三万一千九百八十亩，在进行劳动致富的教育后，又增种八百余亩。莱（阳）东县富水区则在得到秋贷后增种小麦一万大亩（合三万亩）。平（度）西县长乐区七百户缺乏生产资料的农民因获得政府贷给的一万五千斤麦种和五千斤豆饼，乃顺利下种。
