　　Research on Leading the Masses in Production and Mutual Assistance
    Jizhong Branch
  　I. The masses have many naturally formed groups working together

    In rural areas throughout Jizhong, many naturally formed groups working together have begun to be noticed during the autumn harvest and wheat planting. For example, in Wenren Village West Street, Qingyuan, out of 210 households, there are 39 such groups, involving 159 households, accounting for over 75% of the total number of households. In Xiangguan Village, Anping, there are 41 production mutual aid teams, 20 of which existed among the masses previously. According to statistics from 59 villages in Jin County, there are 888 mutual aid teams, with 380 of them having been naturally formed by the masses. What forms do these naturally formed mutual aid groups take?

    The group of Tong Wangjin and Wang Xiaodiao in Xiyangbei, Shulu, started by sharing livestock. Wangjin is a perennial petty trader and doesn't know how to farm. His wife and children at home have no one to take care of them, so Xiaodiao automatically helps him. Wangjin earns money and constantly gives Xiaodiao some pocket money. Xiaodiao's family doesn't have land nearby, so he plants vegetables in Wangjin's nearby land for both families to eat. The two families get along very well. They also built a pigsty and raised pigs together. They have been working together since the Anti-Japanese War, for almost ten years now. – This is a long-term partnership of agriculture and sideline occupations.

    Wang Minghui, a military dependent in Zhangqiu, Shen County, farms 14 mu of land, while Wang Manxiang farms 17 mu. Each has a small donkey and they share a mill. They do other work individually, but now they have developed to agricultural partnership. – This is a partnership in sideline occupations.

    Zhao Hongliang in Wenren Village, Qingyuan, has twelve mu of land, a family of four, but no livestock or carts, and only one female laborer. Zhao Shounan has sixteen mu of land, a family of four, livestock and carts, but Shounan is young and doesn't know how to farm. The two families work together. Shounan learns farming from Hongliang, and Hongliang uses Shounan's livestock and carts. Shounan's family has more land but fewer laborers, but when Hongliang helps Shounan's family, Shounan's family provides meals. When Shounan helps Hongliang's family, no meals are provided. – This is mutual assistance between those with and without labor, with and without livestock and carts.

    Zhao Yuming, a bachelor in Wenren Village, Qingyuan, has five mu of land, no livestock and no carts. Zhao Yanchun's family has twenty mu of land, five people – two younger brothers, a younger sister and an old mother. Yanchun is fifteen years old, accounting for half a laborer, has half a livestock and an old cart. The two families work together. Yuming gets meals when he works for Yanchun, and Yanchun's family doesn't get meals when helping Yuming, and they also do sewing for Yuming. Yuming said: "In previous years, I did everything myself, and there was no surplus at the end of the year. This way, there is more than enough." – This is a mutual aid form combining male labor exchanging for female labor, child labor exchanging for full labor, and human power exchanging for animal power.

    Zhao Youer, Zhao Baoxiang, and Zhao Hongzhen in Wenren Village, Qingyuan, all have livestock and carts and also work together. They said: "It's faster to work this way." – This is a mutual aid group of middle peasants and middle peasants.

    In addition, there are brother groups (brothers who had previously separated the family and then worked together again, eating from the same pot); relative groups; some are based on households, with two or three families working together for a long time; some are based on individuals, working together temporarily according to agricultural seasons and crops, such as planting cotton, pressing yams, and digging peanuts.

    II. What problems can be seen from the naturally formed mutual aid groups of the masses?

    A. The eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the three years of the People's Liberation War, due to the plunder and destruction by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the masses lack manpower and livestock and urgently need to engage in mutual aid production. Some have already organized themselves naturally. Many people already have the habit of working together, but some of our cadres only see the peasants as individual economies, unwilling to organize them, and do not see that the peasants have the habit of working together and can be organized. They did not realize that the masses are unwilling to engage in mutual aid because we have problems in our leadership methods, we did not organize according to the opinions of the masses, and gradually improve on the original basis of the masses.

    B. The mutual aid among the masses is diverse. There are male labor exchanging for female labor, human power exchanging for animal power; those with livestock and those without livestock, those with many people and those with many people, those with few people and those with few people, some are long-term mutual assistance based on households, some are temporary mutual assistance based on individuals, poor peasants and middle peasants, middle peasants and middle peasants, from agriculture to sideline occupations to petty trade... the scope of mutual assistance is extensive. Some cadres believe that different conditions mean they cannot be organized, some believe that middle peasants have their own cattle and carts and do not need to be organized for mutual assistance, but the facts prove that this is wrong. According to the research of the Eleventh District Committee of Jizhong, most of the old mutual aid teams are middle peasants. According to the survey of seven natural mutual aid groups of the masses in Langli Village, Shen County, some have been working together for twenty years, and they are all middle peasants. This also shows that middle peasants also need mutual aid production, and they are experienced and should be learned from.

    III. What common characteristics are there in the natural mutual aid of the masses?

    A. Not restricted by form, free and voluntary. They say: "Willing to join, willing to leave", unwilling to call it a mutual aid team, fearing that the superiors will find out and interfere, and then they will not be free. Most are two families who get along well, the so-called "heart for heart, eight liang for half a jin", "emotion for emotion, righteousness for righteousness", this is their theory of working together.

    B. No work recording or work clearing has been found in all the natural mutual aid groups of the masses. They said: "Why record work, that seems so insincere", "Who doesn't have a little calculation in their heart, this is a matter of buying one good thing for two good things." But we cannot only look at the problem superficially. Although the masses are unwilling to record work openly, they have a number in their hearts. On closer analysis, there is a general equivalence, or not much difference. As mentioned above, Zhao Yuming and Zhao Yanchun in Wenren Village, Qingyuan, work together. Zhao Yuming is a strong laborer, one person, five mu of land, Zhao Yanchun has five laborers, five people, twenty mu of land. On the surface, the difference seems very large, but Yuming uses Yanchun's livestock and carts, and gets meals when working for Yanchun, and Yanchun's family does sewing for Yuming all year round. This combination is close to equivalence. Facts have proved that violating equivalence cannot last.

    C. The number of households in each group is generally two or three. According to statistics from 66 villages in five districts of Jin County, there are 636 old mutual aid groups of the masses, with 1,817 households participating, averaging 2.8 households per group. The newly organized 576 groups have 1,470 households participating, averaging 2.3 households per group.

    D. Many mutual aid teams start from raising livestock together, and develop step by step. As mentioned above, Tong Wangjin and Wang Xiaodiao in Xiyangbei, Shulu County, started from raising livestock together to working together, from agricultural cooperation to sideline occupation cooperation, gradually expanding the scope of mutual aid. After the autumn harvest, the number of people raising livestock together in rural areas is increasing day by day. This is a very good foundation for developing rural production mutual aid. We should seize this link and improve the scope of mutual aid among the masses. However, the number of families raising livestock together should not exceed two or three at most, otherwise problems will occur. For example, in the case of rotation feeding, everyone is unwilling to feed more fodder, and in the case of rotation use, they do not cherish it. After a long time, the livestock are greatly injured, even die. Some villages have eight or nine people raising one livestock, which should be resolved quickly.

    IV. How to organize mass production mutual aid?

    A. Do things according to the opinions of the masses, educate the masses with the creations of the masses, go deep into the naturally formed mutual aid groups of the masses, help them solve difficulties, take a step forward on the old basis, absorb their experience, spread the benefits of their mutual aid, drive others, generate new mutual aid teams, and repeat this education to gradually develop.

    B. In addition to leading cadres taking the lead, the backbone role of activists is very important in organizing mass mutual aid. There must be a large number of activists to have a comprehensive development. In the beginning, we can start from within the Party, mobilize Party members to take the initiative to drive the masses. We should also pay attention to finding the farming experts among the masses, those who have become rich through long-term labor together, and the production models recognized by the masses, cultivate and encourage them to become activists to drive the masses, which will have the greatest effect.

    C. Do it at any time, publicize it at any time, break the masses' worries at any time, discover the creations of the masses at any time and educate the masses. Pay attention to the busy farming season, do not delay the masses' production time, seize the natural time of the masses (after lunch, after dinner, during chatting), natural places (the T-shaped street where the masses chat, temple platforms, dining places, etc.), not restricted by form, talking and discussing at the same time, talking as many people as there are, publicizing and brewing to send it to the door. But there must be investigation and preparation in advance, and the masses like to hear about rewarding production, improving methods of service burdens, etc., and the real people and real things in the local village.

    D. We cannot be satisfied with the status quo of the natural groups of the masses, and abandon leadership, and not improve them. The natural groups of the masses have their convenience, but after all, they are still spontaneous, low-level forms, not the planned and organized mass production mutual aid that we require. For example, many are based on emotions, warmth and face-saving, sometimes they are unwilling to speak out when they have opinions, and they are bored in their hearts. After a long time, some collapse due to mutual suspicion. We should help them establish necessary systems, discuss everything, advocate opening the nose and speaking frankly, and promote democratic work style. Also, they are conservative in agricultural technology, stick to old ways, and are unwilling to accept new inventions and creations. Some also commit closed-doorism, limited to a small scope, unwilling to let anyone else join, etc., which must be helped by the leadership to overcome.

　　领导群众生产互助研究
    冀中分社
  　一、群众有很多自然形成的插伙做活组
    冀中各地农村中，有很多自然形成的插伙做活组，在秋收种麦工作中开始被人们注意了。如清苑温仁村西街共二百一十户即有插伙做活组三十九个，参加的一百五十九户，占总户数百分之七十五以上。安平香官村，有四十一个生产互助组，群众以前旧有的二十个。又据晋县五十九个村统计，共有八百八十八个互助组，以前群众自然形成的三百八十个。这些自然形成的插伙互助组，都是些什么形式呢？
    束鹿西阳北佟旺进和王小刁插伙组，先是从伙牲口起。旺进常年做小买卖，不会做庄稼活，家里老婆孩子无人照顾，小刁就自动给他帮忙。旺进赚了钱，也不断给小刁些零花。小刁家没近地，就在旺进家近地里种上菜，两家伙吃，两家越待越合适，又伙挖了猪圈伙喂猪，从抗日战争开始后就伙着，现在将近十来年。——这是农业和副业长期的合伙。
    深县张邱军属王明辉，种地十四亩，王满祥种地十七亩，各人喂着个小驴，伙着开磨房，别的活个人干个人的，现在发展到农业合伙了。——这是副业的合伙。
    清苑温仁村赵洪亮十二亩地，四口人，没有牲口和车，一个女劳动力。赵守南十六亩地四口人，有牲口有车，但是守南年青，不会做庄稼活，两家合伙做活，守南跟洪亮学做活，洪亮使守南的牲口、车，守南家地多劳动力少，但洪亮给守南家做活时，守南家管饭，守南给洪亮家做活时不管饭。——这是有劳动力和没劳动力、有牲口有车和没牲口的互助插伙。
    清苑温仁村赵玉明是个光棍汉，五亩地，没有牲口没有车，赵燕春家二十亩地五口人二弟一妹和老娘，燕春今年十五岁，顶半个劳动力，有半个牲口一个旧车，两家插伙做活。玉明给燕春做活时管饭，燕春家帮玉明做活时不管饭，并给玉明做针线活。玉明说：“往年光我自己做活，干一年来没剩头，这么着则有敷余。”——这是男工换女工、童工换整工、人力换畜力相结合的互助形式。
    清苑温仁村赵有二、赵保祥、赵洪振三家都有牲口有车也合伙做活，他们说：“这样做活快。”——这是中农和中农的插伙互助组。
    此外还有兄弟插伙组（以前兄弟分家，后又合伙做活，分锅吃饭）；亲戚合伙组；有以户为单位，三两家长期插伙的；有以人为单位按农业季节农作科目临时搭伙的，如种棉花、压山药、刨花生等。
    二、从群众自然的插伙互助组中，看出些什么问题。
    甲、八年抗日战争，三年的人民解放战争，由于日寇蒋匪的掠夺破坏，群众人力畜力缺乏，迫切需要插在互助生产，有的已经自然的组织起来，很多群众已有了插犋合伙生产习惯，但我们有的干部却只看见农民是个体经济，不愿意组织起来，而没有看见农民有合伙生产的习惯，是能够组织起来的；没有认识到群众不愿插伙互助，是我们在领导方法上有毛病，没有按群众意见去组织，并在群众原有基础上逐步提高。
    乙、群众的插伙互助是多种多样的。有男工换女工的，人力换畜力的；有牲口的和无牲口的，人多和人多的，人少和人少的，有以户为单位长期互助的，有以人为单位临时互助的，贫农和中农的，中农和中农的，从农业到副业到小买卖…………互助的范围是广泛的。有的干部思想上认为条件不一样就不能组织起来，有的认为中农自己有牛有车不需要组织互助，事实证明是不对的。据冀中十一地委研究，在旧的互助组中大多数是中农。又据深县郎里村七个群众自然互助组的调查，有插伙做活到二十年的，都是中农。这也说明中农同样需要互助生产，并且是有经验的，应该向他们学习。
    三、在群众自然插伙互助中有些什么共同特点呢？
    甲、不拘形式，自由自愿。他们说：“愿合就合，愿散就散”，不愿叫互助组的名称，怕上级知道了要管，就不自由了。多是两家不错，所谓“人心换人心，八两换半斤”，“情感情，义感义的事”，这就是他们的插伙理论。
    乙、在所有群众自然的互助组里还没有发现记工清工的。他们说：“记什么工，那显着多么薄气”，“谁心里没有个小九九，这是两好买一好的事。”但是我们不能只从表面上看问题，群众虽然不愿意明着记工，可是心里是有数的。仔细分析起来，都有个总的等价，或是相差不多。如前面所举清苑温仁村赵玉明和赵燕春两家插伙做活，赵玉明一个壮年劳动力、一口人五亩地，赵燕春五个劳动力，五口人二十亩地，表面看来相差很远，但是玉明使用燕春家的牲口和车，给燕春家做活时管饭，燕春家长年给玉明做针线活，这样一搭配便近于等价了。事实证明，违反了等价是不能持久的。
    丙、每个插伙组的户数一般都是两三家。根据晋县五个区六十六个村统计，旧有的群众互助组六百三十六个，参加的一千八百一十七户，平均每组二点八户强。新组织起的五百七十六组，参加的一千四百七十户，平均每组二点三户强。
    丁、很多互助组都是从伙养牲口开始，一步步发展起来的。如前面所说束鹿县西阳北佟旺进和王小刁从伙养牲口开始到伙做活，从农业合作到副业合作，逐步扩大互助范围。土收后，农村中伙养牲口的一天天增多，这是发展农村生产互助的很好基础，我们应抓住这个环节，把群众的互助范围，再提高一步。但伙养牲口，最多不应超过两三家，否则，会发生毛病的，如轮流喂养，大伙不愿多喂草料，轮流使用，不加爱惜，工夫长了，牲口受伤很大，以致死亡。有的村子，有八、九家伙养一个牲口的，应赶快解决。
    四、怎样组织群众生产互助？
    甲、按群众的意见办事，以群众的创造去教育群众，深入到群众自然组成的插伙互助组里去，帮助他们解决困难，在旧有基础上提高一步，吸取他们的经验，把他们插伙互助的好处传播出去，带动别人，产生新的互助组，这样反复教育，逐步发展。
    乙、除领导干部亲自动手外，在组织群众互助中，积极分子的骨干作用是非常重要的，必须有大批的积极分子，才能有面的开展。开始时可以先从党内着手，动员党员，主动的去带动群众，还要注意寻找群众的庄稼把式，常年插伙做活劳动发家的、群众所公认的生产上的模范，培养与鼓励他们成为积极分子去带动群众，收效最大。
    丙、随时做，随时宣传，随时打破群众的顾虑，随时发现群众创造又教育群众。要注意农忙季节，不要耽误群众生产时间、抓紧群众自然的时间（午饭后，晚饭后歇晌聊天的工夫），自然的场所（群众聊天的丁字街、庙台、饭场等），不拘形式，一面说一面讨论，有多少人谈多少人的，宣传酝酿送上门去。但事先要有调查有准备，群众爱听奖励生产，改进勤务负担办法等，和本地本村的真人实事。
    丁、不能满足群众自然插伙组的现状，而放弃了领导，不去提高一步。群众自然的插伙组，有它的便利处，但到底还是自发的，低级形态的，还不是我们所要求的有计划、有组织的群众生产互助。如很多是建立在感情的基础上，温情好面子，有时有意见不肯说，心里腻烦，时间长了，有的因互相猜疑而垮台。应该帮助他们建立必要的制度，有事大家商量，提倡打开鼻子说亮话，发扬民主作风。又如他们对农业技术上的保守，墨守成规，不愿接受新的发明创造，还有的犯关门主义，局限于小的范围，不愿再有人入伙等，这都要领导上帮助群众克服的。
