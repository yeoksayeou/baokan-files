According to reports in the Pingjin newspapers: simultaneously with the strikes by teachers and students in Ping, Tianjin, Tangshan, Qingdao, Chengdu, Nanjing, and Shanghai, anti-hunger movements have also erupted in Kunming and Hankou. Professors at Yunnan University in Kunming went on strike for three days starting November 1st to demand adjustments in their treatment. The Hankou Municipal Schools Staff Friendship Association submitted a request to the Kuomintang Municipal Government on the 3rd, asking for the issuance of November salaries and advance payment of December salaries, the allocation of one dan of rice, three dan of coal, three jin each of oil and salt, and the issuance of winter clothing expenses. They also stated that if there were no satisfactory results, they would all take "general leave" for three weeks. At the beginning of this month, the anti-hunger movement in Nanjing, Beiping, and Tianjin continued to expand. Following the "general leave" taken by professors from various universities and specialized schools in Nanjing to the puppet Executive Yuan, teachers from more than fifty municipal primary schools in Nanjing went on a general strike starting on the 4th, demanding improved treatment and the distribution of material goods. Municipal primary and secondary school teachers in Beiping resumed a general strike for one week starting on the 1st, and private middle school teachers went on strike for three days starting on the same day. On November 3rd, Tianjin private university, middle, and primary schools sent sixty representatives to the Kuomintang Municipal Government to petition, demanding that 10,000 bags of flour be borrowed first for relief. The schools participating in the petition included three university units, forty-seven middle school units, two hundred and five primary school units, and eighty-five vocational and supplementary schools.
