　　How Did Li Shunda Complete His Home-Building Plan Ahead of Schedule?
　　Li Shunda, a labor hero from Xigou, Pingshun, turned over and became prosperous after the rent reduction movement in 1944, and his life became richer day by day. In the spring of 1946, after several family meetings and discussions, he formulated a five-year construction plan. The main content was: build three west-facing rooms in 1946, build three east-facing rooms in 1947, build two south-facing rooms in 1948, repair three cave dwellings in 1949, and build a millstone and a well in 1950. Within five years, he would make two hand-operated weaving machines, five double-wheeled spinning wheels, each person would have a new quilt and a new set of long clothes, each kang (platform bed) would have a felt mat, feed a mule, and raise eighty sheep. After the plan was formulated, he researched and calculated the time, economic, and labor resources. Although the grain produced each year was sufficient for consumption, it was not enough for construction costs. The women proposed to spin and weave more, and the men guaranteed to increase grain production to complete the plan. After three years of hard work by the whole family, great achievements were made. The plan completion is as follows: built three east-facing buildings (the original plan was for single-story rooms), a gatehouse (not in the original plan), two south-facing rooms, three west-facing rooms, two earth sheds (not in the original plan), a millstone, a well, nine spinning wheels, three hand-operated shuttle weaving machines (the original plan was for two), each person has a new quilt, plus a guest quilt, six felt mats were made, and a set of small cabinets, tables, and stools were made. The original plan was to buy a mule, but because Xigou is a mountain valley with no major roads, the profit from feeding a mule was small, so a cow was bought instead. Currently, only the cave dwelling has not been repaired. In addition, due to lack of experience in raising sheep, more than thirty adult sheep died last year alone. Overall, the plan was not only completed but exceeded.
　　The main experiences summarized this time in completing the plan ahead of schedule are as follows: First, firmly believe in the Party's policies. Comrade Shunda was a landless tenant farmer in the past. Under the support of the Party's policies, he had land and a home through his own labor. Therefore, he was very enthusiastic about production and becoming prosperous. He did whatever the Party called for. He said, "As long as you follow the Party, you will never go wrong." The Party called for production and prosperity, so he formulated a construction plan for production and prosperity, always thinking about how to realize it. He said that he was a Party member, a hero, and a cadre. If we don't take the lead in implementing the Party's policies and set an example, the masses will not know what to do.
　　This spring, the ideology of cadres and the masses was confused and uneasy, and Shunda was also a little confused, but he did not lie down and do nothing. He actively sought out the higher authorities and visited the village where the Party was being rectified. He believed that the Party's policies would not be wrong, and he still actively repaired houses and built homes according to his plan.
　　Second, closely integrate long-term and short-term plans. A long-term plan is a goal to strive for, and there must also be a short-term plan for each season to ensure its realization. Comrade Shunda grasped the short-term plan very tightly. For example, after the autumn harvest and before the ground froze last year, he seized the time to make adobe bricks. After the ground froze, he specialized in winter production. He finished delivering fertilizer before the fifteenth day of the first lunar month this year. As soon as the ground thawed in the second lunar month, he started building walls. After sowing, he immediately laid tiles and slate on the house. After laying the tiles, the seedlings would be quickly weeded, and then concentrated efforts would be made to weed the seedlings. In the three years of construction, due to seizing the time, seasonal production and construction were closely combined. Production was not affected, and the house was built.
　　In the winter of 1946, because it was snowing and cold, and no other work could be done, he dug a well and reinforced the well at home, not letting a moment pass in vain. Due to careful planning, a lot of work was saved.
　　Third, the construction plan was flexibly changed. The original plan was to build the millstone and the well in the last year (1950), but because carrying water was very far, and a lot of effort was spent in building the east room, Shunda decided to build the well and the millstone first. Because there were very few mills originally (Xigou only had this one mill), not much could be ground each day. During the construction, even more had to be eaten. If the millstone was not built first, it would waste human and animal power. After the millstone and the well were built first, about one hundred and sixty workdays were saved in these two years for both household consumption and construction water. Saving labor and grain played a great role in the construction.
　　Fourth, the whole family, men and women, worked together. Because they had just turned over and had not yet taken root, it was limited to carry out such a large construction if only relying on the strength of men. Therefore, Li Shunda mobilized all the women in the family to work together and help the male laborers in production and construction. Women participated fully in sowing, weeding, harvesting, and other seasons. Women accounted for one-third of the total labor in agricultural production, saving a large number of male laborers for construction. In sideline production, since 1946, the whole family's spinning and weaving, in addition to their own use, also sold cloth to buy 9.5 shi of rice. Raising sows and piglets, they sold 27.7 shi of rice in three years. Sideline production accounted for 31.2% of the total agricultural production in three years, which played a decisive role in completing the construction ahead of schedule. The whole family worked together to complete the prosperity plan.
　　Shunda's family is a democratic family. Family problems are solved through family meetings. Shunda's mother always first examines herself at each family meeting and encourages everyone to examine themselves.
　　In doing work, it is decided according to each person's physical strength. For example, Guilan (Shunda's wife) is strong, so she helps more in the fields in agriculture; Buqiao (the fourth son's wife) is weak, so she burns more firewood and grinds more at home. In this way, everyone is very satisfied. Due to the efforts of the whole family, the construction plan was completed ahead of schedule and even exceeded in some parts.

### 李顺达是怎样提前完成建家计划的？

　　李顺达是怎样提前完成建家计划的？
    平顺西沟劳动英雄李顺达，经过四四年减租运动翻了身，四五年大生产运动发了家，生活一天天的富裕起来，在一九四六年春，经过数次家庭会议的讨论研究，订出了五年建设计划，主要内容是：四六年盖西平房三间，四七年盖东平房三间，四八年建南厦两间，四九年修补窑脸三孔，五零年建碾子一盘，水井一眼。在五年之内，做手拉机两架，双轮纺车五辆，每人要有一条新被子，每人有一套长余的新衣服，每个炕上有毡子，喂骡子一头，养羊八十个。订出这个计划以后，又根据时间和经济人工力量，作了研究和计算，每年打的粮食，吃用虽有余，加上建设费则不足，妇女们即提出多纺织，男人保证增产粮食来完成计划，经过全家三年努力，得到很大成绩。计划完成情形计：盖东楼三间（原计划是平房），街门楼一间（原计划没有），南厦两间，西平房三间，土棚两间（原计划没有），碾子一盘，水井一眼，纺车九辆，手拉梭织布机三架（原计划二架），每人有条新被子，另有客被子一条，赶毡六领，并做小柜桌凳一部。原计划买骡子一头，因为西沟是山沟不通大路，喂骡子利小，因此买牛一头。现在仅是窑没有补修好，另外在养羊上因没有经验，去年一年就死了大羊三十多只。总的算来，不但完成并超过了计划。
    这次总结提前完成计划的经验，主要有以下几点：首先是坚信党的政策。顺达同志过去是个无地无家的佃农，在党的政策扶植下，凭着自己劳动有了土地也有了家，因此他生产发家劲头很高，党号召什么他就做什么，他说：“只要跟上党走永无差路”。党号召生产发家，他就订出了生产发家的建设计划，时刻想着如何实现，他说自己是个党员，又是个英雄和干部，咱不首先执行党的政策做出个榜样，群众也会摸不着底。
    今春干部群众思想混乱不安，顺达也有点摸不着底，但他并没有躺倒不干，积极的找上级，到整党村访问，他相信党的政策不会错了，他仍然按着自己的计划积极的修房盖屋建设家务。
    第二是长短计划密切结合，长期计划是一个奋斗目标，还必须得有每个季节的短计划保证实现。顺达同志对短期计划抓的非常紧。如去年秋收后上冻前，抓紧时间砸坯，上冻后专搞冬季生产，在今年正月十五前将肥送完，在二月头刚开冻，即进行垒墙壁建设。播种以后，即往房子上铺瓦和片石，铺好后，田苗也就快锄，再集中力量进行锄苗。在三年的建设中，由于抓紧了时间，季节生产和建设密切的结合，生产上没有受了损失，房也盖起了。
    四六年冬，因下雪天冷不能做其他生活，即在家里打井，砸井，不叫白过一时，由于计划周到，省了很多工。
    第三是建设计划灵活变动。原计划碾子和水井在最后一年（五零年）建设，可是因担水很远，在建设东房时，多费了很多工夫，顺达即决定先建水井和碾子。因为原来的碾子很少，每天不碾多少东西（西沟就这一盘碾子），在建设中吃的更多，要不先建碾子，就要浪费人畜力。经先把碾子和水井建成以后，连自家吃带建设用水，在这二年中约省工夫一百六十多个。省工省粮食，对建设起了很大的作用。
    第四是全家男女一齐动手。因为刚翻了身，还没有扎下根，进行这样大的建设，如果光靠男人的力量，是有限的。因此李顺达便发动了全家妇女也一齐动手，帮助男劳力生产建设。在下种、锄苗、秋收等季节中，妇女都全部参加，妇女在农业生产上，占农业总用工三分之一，省出了大批男劳力用于建设。在副业生产上，自四六年起全家纺织除自用外还卖布进米九·五石，喂母猪养小猪，在三年内卖米二十七石七斗，副业生产占农业生产三年的总数三分之一点二，对建设提前完成起决定作用。全家齐心合力的为完成发家计划而努力。
    顺达的家庭是一个民主的家庭，家里问题都靠开家庭会解决。顺达娘在每次开家庭会时，总要首先检讨自己，启发每个人自我检讨。
    在做活上，是根据每人的体力来决定。如贵兰（顺达媳妇）体力强，在农业上多帮助做地里活；补巧（老四媳妇）体力弱，在家多烧火多推碾，这样大家都很满意。由于全家的努力，促使建设计划提前完成，并有部分超过。
