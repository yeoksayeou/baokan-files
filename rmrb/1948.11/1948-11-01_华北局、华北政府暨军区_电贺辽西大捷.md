    Telegraphic Greetings on the Great Victory of West Liaoning
    [This newspaper dispatch] The CCP Central Committee's North China Bureau, the North China People's Government, and the North China Military Region sent a telegram to Comrades Lin Biao, Luo Ronghuan, Gao Gang, and Chen Yun, and to all comrades of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, congratulating them on the great victory in West Liaoning. The telegram stated: "Following the great victories in Jinzhou and Changchun, you have once again annihilated twelve divisions of the main force of the enemy army in Northeast China in one fell swoop in West Liaoning. The battle achievements are astonishing and have shaken the world. All the soldiers and civilians in North China are urgently mobilizing to prepare to deal a severe blow to the Chiang Kai-shek-Fu Zuoyi bandit troops who dare to advance and harass the Shijiazhuang area, so that not a single soldier or troop of the frenzied and adventurous bandits can escape back to their lairs, in order to cooperate with your great final battle to liberate the Northeast and strive for the early arrival of the liberation of all of North China."
