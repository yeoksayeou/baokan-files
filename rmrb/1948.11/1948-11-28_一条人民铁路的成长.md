　　The Growth of a People's Railway
    Zhan Chao, Zhang Shen
  　I. The People's Train Sets Off
    At 8:00 PM on July 7th this year, two trains fully decorated with colorful lights and flowers departed simultaneously from Shijiazhuang Station, heading east and west. This was after the grand opening ceremony. Comrade Yang Xiufeng, then Vice Chairman of the North China Government, cut the red ribbon between the two facing locomotives, and the 300-kilometer people's railway, stretching from Yangquan in the west to Dezhou in the east, took on its mission. The brightly polished locomotive puffed steam, and the crowd on the platform cheered. The reporter sat in the exquisite reception car heading east, watching the men, women, old, and young who had come from all directions of the countryside to celebrate at every station passed. Under the bright red flags, drums were beating, and songs were loud and clear. On both sides were the lush green fields of crops... Infinite excitement, infinite joy.

    II. A New Record of 4 Kilometers and 300 Meters
    In history, the Kuomintang built roads at a rate of one kilometer per day. The Japanese used machines to build roads, but even they only managed three to four kilometers per day. However, in the restoration of the Yangde Railway under the leadership of the Communist Party, a new record of 4 kilometers and 300 meters was created in a single day. The average speed was also more than one and a half kilometers. How easy was this? During the war, the great people, in order to cut off the supply lines of the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, painfully and thoroughly destroyed the original three railways—Zhengtai, Shide, and Pinghan—that ran through Shijiazhuang. This was absolutely necessary. Only in this way could the enemy be eliminated and the railway turned into the people's own. With the liberation of Shijiazhuang, the restoration project began on November 17th last year (the fifth day after liberation). There were many difficulties. No sleepers could be seen on the railway line, and the rails were either missing or bent. Trenches were dug crisscrossing the roadbed. The Shide line had become farmland. The Shiyang line had four "mores": more bridges, more tunnels, more curves, and more slopes. Major bridge bodies were submerged in the river, and tunnels were collapsed and impassable. Shijiazhuang lacked materials and tools. All that was available was the ring road around the city, built by the enemy to "defend" the isolated island, and what people jokingly called the Shifu line (from the station to the entrance of the Rotary School, less than two kilometers).

    In such circumstances, how to repair the railway? The guiding principle of the railway bureau leadership was to concentrate efforts on restoring the line first, with other construction to come later. However, many of the newly liberated workers were shaking their heads, lacking confidence. Work started, but they doubted whether the Communist Party could repair the road. They couldn't figure out the policies, and they faced significant difficulties. They weren't hammering with much energy, doing pretty much the same "slow work" as when repairing roads in the past. Coupled with poor planning and lack of coordination, they were spiking only two to three hundred meters of track per day. Moreover, many people felt they simply couldn't stay here, thinking of going to Tianjin or Beijing...

    However, the peasants along the line mobilized like a tidal wave. In the vast countryside, they sawed sleepers and dug out the railway tracks that had been buried years ago. Thousands of carts and tens of thousands of people transported day and night from hundreds of miles away towards the winding line. Farmers in Leitou Village, Shulu County, dug out more than 300 railway tracks from ditches more than ten feet deep in seven days and nights. The Gaocheng material team could collect 3,000 tracks every day. Many women and children with bound feet in Pingding County also carried sleepers. On one of the sleepers in the pile in Dezhou, it was written: "Born and raised on the banks of the Zhulong (River), the master felled me to pad the road, materials from all directions are carried across, from now on, the border region has another day." Signed: "Li ××, Suning." From Hengshui to Dezhou, more than 60,000 civilians repaired the roadbed, repairing 63 kilometers in three days, and padding it with more than 300,000 cubic meters of material. In Yangquan, 300 blacksmiths participated in spiking rails... 700,000 sleepers and 70,000 railway tracks were thus returned to the railway line that had become the people's own.

    The workers became increasingly tense. Factories and sections rushed to manufacture materials—screws, spikes, fishplates... trainloads of them were transported to the track-laying engineering teams, which advanced in separate directions. The three pioneering teams were active in an atmosphere of democracy and unity. Work plans were discussed by everyone, and many people had thoughtful ideas. Work was carefully allocated to each department, often competing with each other to make breakthroughs. Leading cadres personally got involved, heroes and role models took the lead everywhere, local people provided support everywhere, and passing troops cheered slogans. The workers worked tirelessly, stripping to the waist even in the cold weather. Four people carried a rail, one person carried two sleepers, and the sound of their voices shook the mountains: "Brothers, put in a little more effort! Hey! We are the locomotive! Hey! We are not afraid of the sun! Resolutely repair it forward!"

    What power changed the initial lack of confidence and made everyone as fierce as tigers? They had study time every day. Cadres used examples to explain the Communist Party's policies and practically cared about the lives of the workers. The workers' associations, which were established one after another in March and April, united everyone. People personally witnessed the happy lives of the rural masses. Everyone began a new democratic life, electing role models, using stones to vote, and taking down the hats of many candidates as targets for illiterate workers to choose to vote. Thus, awareness was raised, and everyone democratically formulated labor discipline, learning the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention like soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, not stepping on the melons, vegetables, and seedlings by the roadside, sweeping and carrying water when staying in farmers' homes, compensating for damage, and helping families of revolutionary soldiers and poor people without labor to pull wheat... This new style greatly changed the feelings of the rural people. In the past, railway workers were seen as people eating Western food, and no one dared to provoke them; now, they were as close as family. Ji Fulai of the First Engineering Team lived in Yanfeng Village, and the landlord insisted on making him a pair of shoes.

    Everything was done to repair the railway. The workers' union educated and united thousands of employees throughout the railway. Veterans who had gloriously participated in the "February 7th" struggle were highly respected. Communist Party members everywhere played a exemplary role. Wages were gradually adjusted. In the initial months after liberation, the mistake of egalitarianism was made, with workers and technicians alike divided into only three grades of daily wages: three, four, or five catties of rice. Preliminary corrections were made in April. According to the pre-incident base salary converted to current prices, it was divided into three grades, with the lowest apprentice receiving a monthly salary of 120 catties of rice, and general workers and staff receiving over 210 catties. Engineers and technicians received special treatment. Some received monthly salaries of over 1,000 catties. It was adjusted once again later. The lowest was 390 catties, and the general was over 450 catties. Now, with the increase in transportation business income, another adjustment is being planned, and welfare work has also made great progress. The supply cooperative (formerly known as the cooperative), established with investment from the railway bureau, distributed government relief rice, helped workers exchange Chiang banknotes, and sold daily necessities for a period of time after its establishment immediately after liberation. In April, it began to purchase rice and coal in large quantities from outside the city and sell them to employees at low prices every month. Families with four or fewer people could buy 40 catties of rice per person per month; families with more than four people could buy 30 catties per person. Each catty of rice was, on average, 30-50 yuan (Ji banknotes) lower than the wage rice price and the market price, sometimes as much as 100 yuan lower. The allocation of coal was 200 kilograms per person per month (employees only, not including family members). This was 70% cheaper than the market price. To facilitate employees in the city and along the line, five branches were established in different regions. The needs of external stations were transported by train. As of the end of September, the supply cooperative had sold 2,260,694.12 catties of millet, nearly 100 million yuan lower than the wage rice price and the market price. It sold 5,504 tons and 310 kilograms of coal at a low price of 294,791,876 yuan. In this way, the actual goods received by employees were much higher than the amount of rice obtained from wages. In addition, the supply cooperative also attached electric mills, electric grinders, soap, soy sauce, vermicelli, sewing and other factories, making or purchasing all daily necessities and selling them to employees at low prices. In total, by the end of September, the total turnover was 1.36 million yuan. In addition, employees' families also organized production. In addition to doing odd jobs such as making shoe soles and spinning cotton thread in the spring, 587 women participated in sewing cotton military uniforms in the summer, sewing 27,429 sets and earning 57,460 catties of rice. Even elderly women in their seventies participated, earning an average of over 100 catties of rice per person, supplementing the family's livelihood. The administration and the trade union tried hard to find ways to settle the lives of employees so that they could settle down in production work. Democratic life is the key to improving everyone's production efficiency. Workers express their opinions as much as possible at various work discussion meetings. The railway is their own home, and everyone truly participates in leadership. In order to improve ideological awareness, culture, and technology, various forms of study classes have been organized in each unit under the leadership of the workers' union, ensuring 1-2 hours of study every day, reading newspapers, discussing issues, learning to read, learning to sing, and learning business. Peking opera research societies and Tieqing Drama Societies have been organized. On every festival, large-scale Yangko teams twist and sing, programs are performed on the stage, and ball games are held in the square... everywhere is filled with cheerful and healthy strength. Over the past year, all railway employees have done their best to engage in the construction of the people's own cause.

    The construction history of the people's railway will forever record these many amazing deeds and admirable model employees. The employees of the material factory picked up 20,000 spikes while dismantling the ring road in the snow. The First Engineering Team created two new records: In hot weather, narrow roadbed, and inconvenient transportation, 150 spiking workers spiked 1,870 meters of track in one day, and also finished spiking a turnout equal to spiking 230 meters of track. When repairing the Xiapan Stone Bridge, the bridge was 77 meters long and 15 meters high. In four hours, 120 workers buckled 108 twelve-meter steel rail beams. This can be said to be an unprecedented new record in the history of China's beam buckling work. They were not afraid of the cold and ice, and repaired the roadbed by wading stones in the river. The Second Engineering Team once reached 4 kilometers and 300 meters in one day during the assault track spiking. In the transport and repair of road materials near Dezhou, the Third Engineering Team came up with a clever way to repair and pave a 2-kilometer rail convenience road for transportation, without using large carts and boats, saving more than 1 million yuan (Ji banknotes) in transportation costs, and saving the labor of the masses who were busy with farming. In the engineering team with democratic life and study life, the workers were well organized and challenged each other. The roadbed workers said: "Where the roadbed is repaired, the sleepers will be laid there!" The steel rail workers said: "Where the sleepers are laid, the steel rails will be laid there!" No one wants to fall behind, and they don't leave the construction site when injured; heroes and role models take the lead everywhere: general workers carry road timbers, averaging 30-50 roots per day, one way trip of one li and 200 meters, each road timber weighs more than 170 catties; and labor hero Pan Chun averages 50-60 roots per day, and 80 roots during the assault, carrying a total of 13,600 catties and walking 100 li in one day. The sleeper captain Huo Yuhai has a democratic style, is hardworking and caring for workers, and is truly praised by everyone. The employees of the material factory are busy, the railway factory is constantly rushing to produce equipment, trains are urgently sending materials, and the workers of the telecommunications section are rushing to repair the power lines along the line. All units are closely coordinated, and all employees are fighting against difficulties with firm will. Model figures emerge in endlessly, and the line is extending day by day. The first and second phases of the project were completed more than ten days ahead of schedule. The opening ceremony was held victoriously. After that, with the victory of the People's Liberation Army in the Jinzhong Campaign, the restoration of the railway from Yangquan westward to the Yuci section began. In order to carry out this project, some employees of the railway factory conducted an unforgettable amazing steel saw race in August. The efficiency of hitting four-point iron bar saws increased from an average of 200 to a maximum of 300 per furnace every eight hours to 800, while the Wang Liansuo furnace, which hit three-point iron bars, created a record of 1,340 in ten hours. More than 20 of them completed the huge task of producing steel saws within three days of the advanced competition plan.

    The slogan "Repair to Taiyuan" and "Repair to Jinan" has become the sound of every railway worker's current practical action. To date, including the two branch lines on the Yangde Line and the ongoing Yangyu section, in the past year, this people's railway with Shijiazhuang as its center has restored a total of 454 kilometers and a total of 117 large bridges. The work of maintaining the road is carried out day and night, paving the line with stones along the line, inspecting and repairing the line, and the road class workers are as diligent and tirelessly patrolling this precious property of the people as the sentinels on the front line.

    The power of the people is great, and the power of democracy is great; this power is fully demonstrated under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the democratic government, and inspired by the heroic struggle of the frontline soldiers. At an exhibition that served as an epitome of the construction of this people's railway, the reporter saw a touching chart. It wrote: In the construction of the dangerous project on the Western Line, the French injured and killed 34 people, the Japanese 18 people, and the Kuomintang 28 people; but in this restoration under the leadership of the Communist Party, no one was injured or killed! The reason for this is self-evident. Of course, there are also shortcomings in the construction of the 300-kilometer railway. The plan is still lacking, and it was somewhat blind at the beginning. The preparation of materials was not timely enough, which sometimes delayed the work. For example, in engineering technology, some places have loose spikes and screws, few sleepers, sloppy construction, some piers or roadbeds are not solid, and most of the station buildings have not been repaired for a long time, and those that have been repaired are leaky, and it is only now that they are being repaired again, which is time-consuming. These are all reviewed and improved in the work.

    III. Build a Station and Open a Station
    Another guiding principle for railway construction at the beginning was: build and transport at the same time, and develop business. This principle also breaks history. Some people say that it is a layman's way of doing things, but without this method, there would be no today. Business started as early as February 5, and all 37 stations were opened for business by July 8, when the entire line was opened. The people along the line were extremely happy. When the train first arrived, many people surrounded it and said, "We must take a good look at the locomotive. Now it belongs to our own people. Who would have dared to approach it in the past!" Some old ladies came by ox cart from dozens of miles away. Women and children dressed in colorful clothes, twisting Yangko, and the crowds were like a sea of people, infinitely happy. In the passenger cars, neatly seated were crowds of people doing business and visiting relatives. Zhang Zhenfeng, the shopkeeper of Quanhe Grocery Store in Hengshui, was transporting a batch of edible oil and paint. He said: "This time it's great. It's a fortune to do business. It used to take ten days to go back and forth, but now it only takes two days." Over the past nine months, hundreds of thousands of tons of goods from public and private enterprises have been transported, and coal, grain, salt, iron, and other goods have been exchanged. Hundreds of thousands of passengers and small merchants have been transported. The freight revenue has subsidized the railway construction and employee salary expenditures, and it has been self-sufficient since June. The transportation policy was further clarified and the work was greatly improved after the section and station manager joint meeting in early September. At the meeting, the work of the previous seven months was summarized. Because of the concentration of efforts, the various equipment on the station was still lacking, and the station staff worked in the weather and heat in the wind and frost, which was extremely difficult, and the results were great. In May, military transport was carried out for several days to support the Jindong (Yushou) campaign. Before the rainy season, a month-long rush transport was carried out to fully accumulate materials and supply grain, salt, etc. to public and private enterprises and citizens. When the bridge and road were damaged during the rainy season, it was not difficult at all. However, the shortcomings were still very serious. In the early stage, there was no plan for transportation, especially the various systems and regulations were not clear, the transportation was not flexible, and there were many accidents. In August, there were 35 accidents in 25 days. Trains were often late and could not arrive on time. Some of the regulations on train use and freight rates were not appropriate. In addition, some station staff had a bad work attitude, and the handling of loading and unloading affected the work, and the local loading and unloading organization was not good, making things difficult for passengers and merchants, which affected the transportation of goods for small and medium-sized merchants. After detailed discussion, the meeting stipulated the general policy of "improving transport volume and facilitating passengers and merchants," streamlining personnel, improving work efficiency, inspecting, rewarding, and punishing, and station staff codes of conduct. In terms of transportation business, in order to welcome the autumn agricultural product exchange, increase less-than-carload shipments and stop along the station to facilitate passengers and merchants. Negotiate with local party, government, trade unions, and chambers of commerce to solve the problem of loading and unloading workers, rectify the organization, and especially emphasize that stations should provide passengers and merchants with convenience as much as possible within the scope of the system, and adopt a patient, kind, and responsible attitude. Various tasks have been significantly strengthened after the meeting. Especially at the end of last month, when the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs conspired to attack Shijiazhuang by surprise, the railway employees completed the task of evacuating and transporting day and night, and many moving deeds emerged.

    It's been a year, and the people's railway has grown up and played a major role. The employees also know a truth: the efforts of construction will accelerate the death of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit rule and improve their lives. They are united in their determination to make the people's own railway built more and extended longer. The people's train is moving forward, heading towards a happy people's society. 1948, 11, 15.

　　一条人民铁路的成长
    展潮　张深
  　一、人民的列车开动了
    今年七月七日下午八点钟，两列满挂彩灯花朵的火车，从石家庄车站同时向东西两面开动，这是在隆重的通车典礼礼成之后。现为华北政府副主席的杨秀峰同志在两个相对的车头的中间把红色的彩绸一剪断，西通阳泉东至德县的一条三百公里的人民铁路载负起了自己的使命。擦得亮亮的车头喷着气，月台上的人群欢呼着。记者坐在东行的精致的招待车上，看着每一个经过的站台上、从四面八方的乡村拥来庆祝的男女老幼，鲜红的旗帜下敲着锣鼓，歌声嘹亮。两面是遍地禾稼的青丛丛的大平原………。无限兴奋，无限快乐。
    二、四公里三百米的新纪录
    历史上，国民党修路是一天一公里。日本人用机器修路，一天也只三——四公里。而在共产党领导下阳德铁路的修复中，却创造过一天四公里三百米的新纪录。平均的速度也在一公里半以上。这谈何容易？战争当中，伟大的人民为了割断日寇和蒋匪军的输血管，是忍痛把原来纵横穿过石家庄的正太、石德、平汉三条铁路彻底的破坏了。这是十分必要的，只有经过这样，才能把敌人消灭，使铁路转成为人民自己的。而随着石家庄的解放，从去年十一月十七日（解放后的第五天），修复的工程就开始了。困难是多的。从铁路线上看不到枕木，铁轨间或有几根也是烧弯了的。路基上交错的挖着壕。石德线变成庄稼地。石阳线有四多：桥梁多，山洞多，弯路多，坡道多。重大的桥身陷在河里，山洞炸塌得不通气。石家庄缺乏器材和工具，有的只是敌人用以“保卫”孤岛的环市路，和人们苦笑着说的石扶线（从车站到扶轮小校门口，不到二公里）。
    在这样的情况下，怎么修法？路局领导上的一条方针是集中力量先修通路线，别的建设靠后点。而新解放的职工们却有不少的在摇头，没有信心。工是动了，却怀疑共产党能不能修成路？摸不着政策的底，眼看着重大的困难；铁锤轮起来劲头不大，和以往修路“磨洋工”差不多。加上计划不周和配合不够，一天钉道二、三百米。而又有不少的人，还根本觉得这里呆不下去，想着到平津去，……。
    但是，沿线的农民们象海潮一样的行动起来了。在广大的农村里，锯好了枕木，挖出了当年埋藏起来的铁轨。成千的大车，成万的人，从数百里之外，向着蜿蜒的线路上，每天运送，日夜运送。束鹿县垒头村的农民，七日夜从埋藏丈余的深沟中挖出三百多根铁轨送来了，藁城材料组每天能收三千根。平定县许多小脚妇女和儿童也扛送枕木，在德县的枕木堆中，有一根上面写道：“自幼生在潴龙（河）畔，主人伐来把路垫，四路物资载过去，从此边区又一天。”下署：“肃宁李××”。从衡水到德县，六万多民修路基，六十三公里三天修好，垫上三十余万方。在阳泉，三百盘烘炉参加打道钉…………。七十万根枕木，七万根铁轨，就是这样回到成为人民自己的铁路线上来的。
    职工们越来越紧张。各厂、段赶忙制造材料，螺丝、道钉、夹板…………一车车的运来钉道的工程队分头前进。三队开路先锋在民主团结的空气下活跃着。工作计划通过大家讨论，人多想的周到。细致地配备各部工作，常常是互相竞赛着往前突击。领导干部亲自下手，英雄模范处处带头，地方群众到处慰劳，过路的军队也欢呼口号。工人们干起来不顾一切，大冷的天也脱光膀子，四人抬一根铁轨，一人扛着两根枕木，吆号的声音震撼着山岳：“哥儿们加点油咧，哎哟！咱们是火车头来，哎哟！不怕它日头晒哟，坚决的往前修哟！”
    什么力量改变了最初缺乏信心的情绪，使大家变得象猛虎一样？他们每天有学习时间，干部们比着实例说明着共产党的政策，实际地关心着工友们的生活，在三、四月份，陆续成立起来的职工分会团结着大家，人们亲眼看着农村群众生活的愉快。大家开始着新鲜的民主生活，选举英模，用石子投票，把许多候选人的帽子搞下来，当作不识字工友投票选择的目标。于是，觉悟提高着，大家民主制定了劳动纪律，象解放军的战士一样，学会了三大纪律八项注意，不踩路边的瓜菜禾苗，住在农民家里扫地担水，损物赔偿，帮助无劳力的军干属和贫民拔麦子，……。这种新的作风大大改变了农村人们的感觉。从前看见铁路工人说是吃洋工的，不敢惹；现在却是亲若家人。第一工程队的纪福来在岩峰村住着，房东一定要给他做双鞋穿。
    一切为了修路而努力。职工会教育、团结着全路数千员工。光荣地参加过“二七”斗争的元老们受着崇高的敬重。共产党员到处起着模范作用。工资逐步地进行调整。解放后初期几个月是犯过平均主义的错误，不论工人、技师，只分日薪三、四、五斤米三等。四月份进行了初步纠正。按照事变前的底薪折合现在物价分为三等，最低的小工学徒月薪一二○斤米，一般工人职员在二一○斤以上。工程师、技师特别优待。有的月薪在千斤以上。后又调整过一次。最低三九○斤，一般在四五○斤以上。现在随着运输营业收入的增加，又在计划调整一次，福利工作也有很大成绩。路局投资成立的供应社（原称合作社）在刚解放时成立，转发政府救济米，帮助职工兑换蒋币及售卖过一个时期的日用必需品后，四月份开始从市外大批采购米、煤，每月低价配售给职工。每家四口人以下者，每月每人可买四十斤米；四口人以上的每人可购三十斤。每斤米较工资米价和市价平均低出三十——五十元（冀钞），有时低至百元以上。煤炭的配售是每人（职工本人，家属不计）每月二百公斤。比市价可便宜百分之七十。为了市内和沿线职工的方便，曾按地区先后设立过五个分社。外站所需是用火车载运送去。截至九月底，供应社共售小米为二、二六○、六九四斤十二两，比工资米价和市价平均低近亿元。售出煤炭五、五○四吨三一○公斤，低价二九四、七九一、八七六元。这样实际上职工所得实物还高于工资所得米数很多。另外，供应社还附设电磨、电碾、肥皂、酱油、粉条、缝纫等工厂，自制或采购一切日用必需品贱价卖给职工，总计至九月底，营业总额为十三亿零六百余万元。此外，职工家属又组织了生产，除春季做鞋底、纺棉线等零活外，夏季缝棉军装共有五八七名妇女参加，缝制二七四二九套，挣米五七四六○斤。七十多岁的老太太也参加了，平均每人得米百余斤，补助了家庭的生活。行政和工会，努力想办法安置职工的生活，使安心于生产工作。民主生活更是大家生产效率提高的主要关键。工人们在各种讨论工作的会议上尽量发表自己的意见，铁路是自己的家，大家真实地参加了领导。为了提高思想觉悟和文化、技术，在职工会的领导下，各单位都组织了各种不同形式的学习班，每天保证一——二小时的学习，读报纸，讨论问题，学识字，学唱歌，学习业务。组织了平剧研究社和铁青剧社，每逢节日，大规模的秧歌队，扭着唱着，戏台上出演着节目，广场里举行着球赛，…………处处充满着欢快健壮的力量。一年来，全体铁路职工克尽努力，从事于人民自己事业的建设。
    人民铁路的建筑史，将永远记载着这许许多多惊人的事迹，和可敬可爱的模范职工。材料厂的职工在拆掉环市路时，冒雪拾道钉两万个。第一工程队两次创造了新纪录：在天气炎热、路基狭窄、运送不便情况下，钉道工人一百五十名一天钉道一千八百七十米，还钉完等于钉道二百三十米的道岔子一付。在修下盘石桥时，桥长七十七米，高十五米，工人一百廿名，四小时内，扣好一百零八根十二米的钢轨梁。在中国的扣梁工作上，可说是历史上空前未有的新纪录。他们不怕天寒冰冷，在河水里涝石头修路基。第二工程队在突击钉道时一天曾达到四公里三百米。第三工程队在德县附近运修路材料中，大家想出巧办法，修铺轨便道二公里运回，不用大车和船运，节省运费百余万元（冀钞），又节省正在农忙的群众劳力。在有着民主生活、学习生活的工程队里，工人们组织好，互相挑着战，道木工人说：“路基修到那里，枕木就铺到那里！”钢轨工人说：“枕木铺到那里，钢轨就铺到那里！”谁也不甘落后，受伤不离开工地；英雄模范更是处处带头：一般工人扛道木，每日平均三十——五十根，往返一次一华里二百米，每根道木重一百七十多斤；而劳动英雄潘春每日平均扛五十——六十根，突击时扛过八十根，一天负重一万三千六百斤，走路一百里。枕木队长霍玉海作风民主，吃苦耐劳，关心工人，真是人人称赞。材料厂的职工忙碌着，铁路工厂不停地赶制器材，列车急送材料，电务段的工人随着路线赶修电线，检车段下雨也不住的修理车辆，各单位紧密地配合，全体职工坚决意志与困难搏斗，模范人物层出不穷，路线日益延伸着。一、二两期工程计划均提前十余天完成。胜利地举行了通车典礼。这之后，随着人民解放军晋中战役的胜利，开始了从阳泉西进至榆次段铁路的修复。为了进行这段工程，铁路工厂一部分员工在八月份进行了不可忘记的惊人的打扒锯竞赛。从以往每炉每八小时打四分铁棍扒锯平均二百个最多三百个的效率提高到八百个，打三分铁棍的王连锁炉则创造了十小时一千三百四十个的纪录。他们二十多个人在提前竞赛计划三天之内完成了巨大数量的扒锯生产任务。
    “修到太原去”，“修到济南去”的口号成为每一个铁路工人当前实际行动的号声。至目前止，连阳德线上的两条支线和正在进行的阳榆段在内，一年来，以石家庄为中心的这条人民铁路已共修复四百五十四公里，较大桥梁共一百一十七座。养路的工作日夜进行着，加铺着沿线的石子，检查整修着线路，道班工人象前线的哨兵一样勤劳无休止地巡逡着这条人民自己的宝贵财产。
    人民的力量是伟大的，民主的力量是伟大的；这种力量在共产党和民主政府的正确领导下，在前线将士的英勇奋战的鼓舞下就充分表现出来。在一次做为这条人民铁路修建缩影的展览会上，记者曾看到一张感人的图表。上面写着：西线险要工程的修建中，法国人修建时伤亡三十四人，日本人修建时十八人，国民党时二十八人；而在共产党领导下的这次修复中却没有一个人伤亡！这原因，是不言而喻的。当然，三百公里铁路修建也是有缺点的。计划性还欠缺，开始有些盲目，材料准备不够及时，有时便误了工作，如在工程技术上，有的地方道钉、螺丝不坚固、枕木少、工程潦草、有些桥墩或路基不坚固、站房长期大部没修、修的也都漏水、至今才再重修费工等。这些均在工作中检讨改进。
    三、修一站开一站
    铁路建设开头的又一条方针是：边修边运，开展营业。这方针也是打破历史的，有人说是外行干法，但没有这办法就不能有今天。远从二月五日就开始营业，至七月八日全线通车，三十七个站也便全部营业。沿线的人民高兴极了，列车刚开来时，许多人围上来，说：“要好好看看火车头，如今是自家的人，从前谁敢靠近一步！”有的老太太坐着牛车从数十里外赶来。妇女儿童们穿起彩衣，扭着秧歌，人山人海，无比的欢欣。在客车里，整齐地排坐着做生意、探亲戚的人群，衡水全和号杂货庄的掌柜张振峰输送着一批食油和油漆，他说：“这回可得了，做买卖发财，过去走着来回得十天，这回两天就够了。”九个月来，运输公私营企业货物数十万吨，煤粮盐铁东西交流着，旅客小商数十万人。运费收入补助了铁路修建和员工薪资开支，从六月份起即达到自给自足。运输方针的更加明确和工作大大改进一步，还是在九月初的段站长联席会议之后。会上，总结了前七个月的工作。因为集中力量，站上各种设备还差，站务人员以车皮当房屋在风霜炎热中工作，极端艰苦，成绩是很大的。五月份还实行数日军运，支援了晋东（榆寿）战役，雨季之前又进行月余抢运，充分地蓄存了物资，供给公私营企业和市民粮盐等。雨季桥、路损坏时毫不受困难。但缺点还很严重，初期运输无计划，特别是各种制度规章不明确，运输不灵活，事故出的多，八月份二十五天中即有三十五次，列车常常晚点，不能准时到达，列车使用和运费规定上有的地方不合适，加以部分站务人员工作态度不好，搞装卸影响工作和地方装卸组织不好，刁难客商，就都影响了中、小商人的运货，会议经过详细讨论，规定了“提高运量，便利客商”的总方针，精简人员，提高工作效率，检查、奖惩、考试等制度和站员守则，运输营业方面，为迎接秋后农产交流，增加零担车和沿站停车便利客商。与各地党、政、工会，商联会协商解决装卸工人问题，整顿组织，特别强调了车站要在制度范围内尽可能予客商方便，采取耐心和蔼负责的态度。会后各种工作已有显著加强。尤其在上月底蒋傅匪帮阴谋偷袭石家庄时，铁路职工夜以继日地完成了疏散运输的任务，出现了许多可歌可泣的事实。
    一年了，人民的铁路成长起来，起了重大的作用。职工们也知道了一条真理：建设的努力将使蒋匪统治加速死亡，将使生活随着改善。他们齐心一致，要使人民自己的铁路修得更多，伸延得更长。人民的火车在前进，朝向幸福的人民的社会在前进。一九四八、十一、十五。
