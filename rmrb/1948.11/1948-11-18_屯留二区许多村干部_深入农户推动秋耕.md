　　【Taiyue Electric】Many village cadres in the Second District of Tunliu went deep into each household to mobilize, help the masses with ideas, and solve difficulties, thus promoting autumn cultivation. For example, in Laojunzhuang Village, more than 30 households had no livestock, and because the accounts of mutual aid in the past were unclear, some people were in arrears with wages, so they could not exchange grass for livestock to plow the land. Some households with livestock said, "I would rather let the livestock lie in the pen than plow the land in this village." When the village chief heard this, he held separate meetings, appropriately criticized the phenomenon of wage arrears, and proposed that "this year, we must not hurt the livestock-owning households again, and we must truly implement equivalent exchange." The livestock-raising households felt that they had a guarantee and began to be willing to sell cattle to plow the land. Then, a method was formulated for exchanging labor for plowing in low-lying and flat areas, as well as a method for women to change labor. Making a pair of shoes would plow 3.4 mu of land; making a suit of clothes would plow 1 mu of land. Everyone was very satisfied with this method, and more than 100 mu were plowed in two days. Qin Sande, chairman of the Lucun Farmers' Association, found that 19 households in the village had not yet carried out autumn cultivation, so he gathered them together for a small meeting to study the issue. Among them, 11 households were old, weak, and unable to work, so he organized them to exchange labor with livestock-owning households. After mobilization, the cattle owners agreed to let them do odd jobs in exchange for cattle labor to plow the land. Yang Jinchang, a loafer, had parents who died of starvation in a famine year, but now he is planting 21 mu of good land, yet he still does not harvest the autumn crops or plow the land. The village cadres went to persuade him, saying, "How did your parents die? If you don't move today, do you still want to starve to death?" Yang Jinchang cried when he heard this sad story and began to voluntarily help each other with Yang Pianhai to actively plow the land. Chang Wenli did not work hard, so the village cadres went to mobilize his wife, saying, "Your land is next to Yin Shiquan's. He planted 8 mu of grain and harvested 24 bags, while your family planted 9 mu and only harvested 8 bags. If people deceive the land, it will deceive your stomach." She immediately brought Chang Wenli back and told him to plow the land. Dong Fengkui, chairman of the Wangzhuang Farmers' Association, mobilized mutual aid to dig the land in order to overcome the difficulty of livestock power, and organized a digging team of 14 people. Currently, of the 111,976 mu of autumn land in the entire district, excluding some flooded land, according to incomplete statistics, more than 45,000 mu have been plowed, which is nearly half. However, some village cadres still neglect the leadership of autumn cultivation. For example, Liu Laifa, a cadre in Quzhuang, made a plan at the district level but still took the lead in transportation when he returned. Qiansu Village had not yet started autumn cultivation by the 28th of last month. This urgently needs to be supervised and corrected.

　　屯留二区许多村干部
  　深入农户推动秋耕
    【太岳电】屯留二区许多村干部，深入各家户进行动员，帮群众出主意，解除困难推动了秋耕。如老军庄村有三十余户没有畜力，又因过去互助帐目不清，有人拖欠工资，所以拿上草也换不到牲口犁地。有些有牲口户说：“宁叫牲口卧到圈里，也不在本村犁地。”村长听到了，就分别召开会议，适当批评了拖欠工资的现象，并提出“今年一定不能再伤着有牲口户，要确实执行等价交换”，养牲口户觉得有了保障，开始愿意卖牛晌耕地。接着就订出洼地、平地换工出来办法，及妇女变工办法。做鞋一双，犁地三亩四分；做衣服一身，犁地一亩。大家对这个办法都很满意，两天就犁了一百多亩。路村农会主席秦三德，发现村里有十九户没有秋耕，就把他们召集起来开小会研究，内有十一户老弱无力，便组织他们与有牲口户变工。经过动员，取得牛户同意，由他们做零活换牛工犁地。二流子杨进昌的父母亲以前是在灾荒年饿死的，但他现在种着二十一亩好地，还是不去收秋，也不犁地。村干部便去劝说他：“你父母是怎样死的？你今天不动弹，还想饿死吗？”杨进昌听到伤心处就哭起来，开始和杨偏孩自愿互助，积极犁完地。常文礼不好好劳动，村干部去动员他老婆说：“你和人家尹实全的地在一块，人家种八亩谷打了二十四布袋，你家种九亩才打了八布袋。人哄了地皮，它就哄你肚皮。”她就马上把常文礼找回来叫他犁地。王庄农会主席董凤魁为克服畜力困难，动员互助刨地，组织起十四个人的刨地组。现全区十一万一千九百七十六亩秋地，除一部水淹地外，据不完全统计，已犁四万五千余亩，将近一半。但有些村干部仍忽视秋耕领导：如曲庄干部刘来法在区上订了计划，回去仍带头搞运输，前苏村到上月二十八日还未开始秋耕等，急待督促纠正。
