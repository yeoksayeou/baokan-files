Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 17th: How to solve the cadre problem in the rapidly developing national revolutionary situation? To answer this question, the Northeast Daily's recent editorial, "Vigorously Promote and Cultivate New Cadres," can be provided as a reference for all liberated areas. The editorial roughly stated:

The complete liberation of the Northeast has presented the Northeast Party with many huge new tasks, especially the task of economic construction, making the scope and nature of our work increasingly broad and complex, and thus we need more and more cadres. As a result, the difficulty of "lack of cadres" and "no cadres" is felt everywhere. How to solve the acute contradiction between the need for cadres and the supply of cadres has become a serious problem for promoting our work forward.

Due to the great victory of the national revolution, we cannot hope to send old cadres from inside the pass (Guannei). On the contrary, we must prepare to transfer a large number of cadres from the Northeast to help establish newly liberated areas inside the pass. At present, we can only strengthen the education of old cadres and further leverage their strength. However, the number of old cadres is so limited that it obviously cannot solve the problem of cadre shortage.

Only by vigorously promoting and cultivating new cadres can the problem of cadre shortage be solved.

Some comrades who are responsible for leadership only see the small number of old cadres, but not the large number of new cadres. They do not understand that the more favorable the political situation is for us, the more extensive and in-depth the mass movement is, the more talented people will emerge from the masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. Undoubtedly, old cadres were the leaders and backbones in the work of establishing the Northeast base, and they will continue to be so in the future. But without the help and support of thousands of new cadres, the establishment of the Northeast base is inconceivable. If we cannot see the existence of these thousands of new cadres and underestimate their role, we cannot correctly solve the problem of cadre shortage by promoting and cultivating new cadres.

Some old cadres who are responsible for leadership, when they select cadres, often only see the advantages of old cadres, but not the advantages of new cadres, and therefore tend to trust old cadres and not trust new cadres enough. Of course, it is right to trust old cadres and to see the advantages of old cadres. As Stalin said, "Old cadres possess something that young cadres do not have, namely, rich experience in leadership, the tempering of Marxist-Leninist principles, profound knowledge of affairs, and the ability to determine policies." Although this advantage is not the same in old cadres of different levels. However, new cadres also have the advantages of new cadres. As Stalin said, "They have a very sufficient perception of new things, which is a valuable quality of every Bolshevik worker." At the same time, it should also be seen that new cadres in the Northeast are more familiar with the local situation than old cadres from inside the pass, and they have close ties with the local masses. They have a high degree of enthusiasm and initiative in their work, and they have the spirit of hard work and endurance. As long as our old cadres can lead them well and boldly promote and cultivate them, they will quickly learn new revolutionary knowledge and new experiences and become powerful assistants and successors to the old cadres. For some stubborn, arrogant, and backward old cadres who hinder the progress of work, their work should be changed without hesitation, and excellent, energetic new cadres should be allowed to take over.

The main reason why some old cadres in leading positions dare not promote new cadres is that they say that new cadres are promoted too early and are afraid of making mistakes in their work, which will damage the work. This concern is specious. In the past three years, a large number of new cadres who have emerged in the Northeast War and land reform have undergone considerable training and cultivation. Therefore, it is time to further promote the outstanding elements among them on a large scale. As for the mistakes and shortcomings of new cadres in new jobs, it is inevitable. As long as we have the correct attitude towards the mistakes and shortcomings of new cadres in their work, we can educate and improve new cadres.

What all old cadres should pay special attention to here is that patient educational work must be carried out on new cadres in their work, rewarding achievements and advantages, pointing out errors and shortcomings, and telling them how to develop achievements and advantages and correct errors and shortcomings. If we can strengthen the education of new cadres well inside and outside the party in the future, carry out criticism and self-criticism correctly, and use various methods to closely link cadres with the masses, we believe that new cadres will definitely make rapid progress and be able to undertake their work happily.

We should overcome all tendencies to neglect and despise new cadres and not dare to promote new cadres. According to the decision of the Northeast Bureau, we should open party schools, training classes, and specialized schools on a large scale to cultivate new cadres in large numbers, improve them step by step, enable them to undertake more work, and transfer a large number of old cadres to newly recovered cities and rural areas to work and complete the new tasks put forward by the new situation.

### 适应革命形势急速开展的需要  要大量提拔培养新干部

　　适应革命形势急速开展的需要
    要大量提拔培养新干部
  　东北日报社论
    【新华社哈尔滨十七日电】在全国革命形势急速发展中，干部问题如何解决？为了答复这个问题，东北日报最近的社论“大量提拔与培养新干部”是可以供给各解放区参考的。该社论略称：
    东北的完全解放，在东北党面前提出许多巨大的新任务，尤其是经济建设的任务，使我们工作的范围与性质，愈来愈广大和复杂，因而我们需要的干部也就愈来愈多。于是到处感觉“缺乏干部”、“没有干部”的困难。如何解决干部的需要与干部的供给这一尖锐矛盾，已成为我们工作向前推进的一个严重问题了。
    由于全国革命的巨大胜利，我们不能希望从关内派来老干部，相反，我们还要准备从东北抽调出大批干部到关内帮助建立新解放区。我们目前只能做到加强老干部的教育，进一步发挥他们的力量。但老干部的数量是如此有限，显然不能解决干部缺乏的问题。
    只有大量提拔与培养新干部，才是解决干部困难问题的主要方法。
    有些担负领导工作的同志，只看到为数很少的老干部，而没有看到大量存在的新干部。他们不了解政治形势愈是对我们有利，群众运动愈是扩大与深入，从工人、农民与知识分子群众中涌现出来有才能的人也就愈来愈多。无疑的，老干部曾是建立东北根据地工作中的领导者与骨干，而且今后还是如此。但如果没有成千成万新干部的帮助与支持，东北根据地的建立是不能设想的。如果我们看不见这成千成万的新干部的存在，对他们的作用估计不足，就不能正确地从提拔与培养新干部中去解决干部的困难问题。
    还有些担负领导工作的老干部，当他们挑选干部时，往往只看到老干部的优点，而没有看到新干部的优点，因而偏于信任老干部，而不够信任新干部。当然，信任老干部是应该的，看到老干部的优点，也是对的。正象斯大林所说的，“老干部拥有年轻干部所没有的东西，即领导方面的丰富经验，马列主义的原则锻炼，深谙事理的知识，决定方针的能力。”虽则这种优点在不同程度的老干部中也不是一样的。但是新干部也有新干部的优点。这正如斯大林所说的，“他们具有很充足的对于新事物的知觉，而这是每一个布尔什维克工作者的宝贵品质。”同时还应该看到，东北新干部较之关内来的老干部更为熟悉当地的情形，他们与当地群众有密切的联系。他们在工作中有高度的热情与积极性，有刻苦耐劳的精神。只要我们老干部能很好的领导他们，大胆的去提拔与培养他们，那他们就会很快的学会革命的新知识与新经验，成为老干部的有力助手与接替者。对于妨碍工作进步的某些顽固不化、傲慢自大的落后的老干部，应该毫不迟疑地调换他们的工作，让优秀的朝气勃勃的新干部去接替他们。
    有些担任领导工作的老干部不敢提拔新干部的主要理由，说是新干部提拔早了，怕在工作中犯错误，使工作受到损害。这种顾虑，是似是而非的。三年来，在东北战争与土地改革中所涌现出来的大批新干部，已经过相当的锻炼与培养。因此，大量地进一步地提拔其中优秀分子，现在已经是时候了。至于新干部在新的工作岗位上发生错误与缺点，那是一定不能避免的。只要对新干部在工作中的错误与缺点有正确态度，就能教育与提高新干部。
    这里要提起所有老干部特别注意的，就是对新干部在工作中必须进行耐心的教育工作，既要奖励成绩优点，又要指出错误缺点，并告诉他们如何发扬成绩优点与纠正错误缺点的办法。如果我们今后在党内外能够很好加强新干部的教育，正确的进行批评与自我批评，用各种方法密切干部同群众的联系，我们相信新干部一定会进步很快，胜任愉快地担负他们的工作。
    应该克服一切忽视与轻视新干部、不敢提拔新干部的偏向，根据东北局决定，大规模开办党校、训练班、专门学校，大批地培养新干部，把他们提高一步，使他们能担负更多的工作，把大批老干部抽调出来，到新收复的城市及农村作工作，完成新形势向我们提出的新任务。
