[Taiyuan Frontline Dispatch] Reporter He Wei Yi reports: The Yan bandits are carrying out the most brutal destruction of Taiyuan, daily using bayonets to force tens of thousands of starving and freezing citizens to repair fortifications and new airports. Three thousand civilian houses around the city have been demolished. Puppet police or "People's Defense Army" personnel are constantly capturing people who evade labor service, using whips to subdue them. The Yan bandits’ current "National Identity Card" inspection is precisely a preparation for organizing and conscripting soldiers. Two thousand workers have already been compiled and threatened to be driven into the bandit army, forcing them to sacrifice their lives and "create miracles" during our army's general offensive. The plunder of property is even more meticulous. Any item on which citizens can rely for survival is listed in the Yan bandits' so-called "Total War Action Program," including: "Living items, issuing payments for purchases; savings items, issuing certificates for borrowing; discarded items, priceless appropriation," even to the point of money's "mobilization, donation, certificate borrowing," etc. The most vicious "ingenious plan" of the Yan bandits to squeeze the citizens is to use a "hand order" from the puppet Economic Management Bureau to force citizens to concentrate gold and silver to "exchange" for flour in Shanghai. According to the puppet People's Evening News, from September 29th to October 1st, in just three days, they plundered 30,368 taels of gold, more than 23,600 silver dollars, and more than 1,400 taels of silver. On the other hand, they secretly ordered their financial departments to seize grain from the citizens, causing prices to skyrocket. Wheat flour rose from 7 million in Chiang currency per catty to 20 million. Sorghum flour rose from 4.8 million per catty to 10 million. Corn flour rose from 5 million per catty to 11 million. Now the Yan bandits want to "take a few heads" to implement "price limits" on daily necessities. All the Yan bandits' measures are for the convenience of plunder.

Not only have the citizens not seen the "exchanged" flour, but now it is even difficult to buy bean cakes or wheat bran to satisfy their hunger. The puppet government and bureaucratic capitalist-run factories are laying off employees under various pretexts. Refugees are everywhere, and the starving are lying dead in the streets. Some poor people committed suicide by jumping into the lake at night, leaving a miserable suicide note by the lake, which read: "I am unfortunate to live in Taiyuan under the rule of Yan Xishan. He wants me to die, but also to die anonymously! To avoid disaster for my family after my death." Skinny abandoned babies are often seen on the lakefront, crying loudly, a tragic scene to hear. The once famous scenic spot, Wenying Lake, is now like a wilderness, eerily frightening.

Many citizens have neither houses nor food, and coal rationing is difficult. Water and electricity have become luxury items, costing fifteen times the original price. Garbage is thrown in gutters and streets, emitting a rotting stench. Manure and ashes are piled up like mountains. The once prosperous city of Taiyuan has become a dead city.

Taiyuan citizens have not been isolated from the liberated areas. The victories and policies of the People's Liberation Army have been flowing into the city. The Yan bandits' reactionary and deceptive propaganda has been secretly refuted by the broad masses of citizens. Everyone or everything that can enter Taiyuan has become a propagator of our policies. Citizens, and even some lower-ranking officers and soldiers, disregard the danger of the Yan bandits' "strict political atmosphere" suppression to inquire, and they are eager to know about the situation in the liberated areas. Recently, an elementary school teacher who escaped from the isolated island of Taiyuan to the liberated area spoke of the following situation: After people from all walks of life understood our urban policy, the fear created by the Yan bandits has calmed down, and they are enthusiastically looking forward to our army's rapid entry into Taiyuan to liberate them.

　　阎匪残酷搜刮掠夺太原市民亟盼解放
    【太原前线电】记者何微一报导：阎匪对太原正进行最残酷的毁灭，每日用枪尖逼着成万在饥寒交迫中的市民抢修工事和新机场，城周三千间市房被拆掉。伪警察或“民卫军”整日捕捉逃避劳役的人，用鞭挞去征服他们。现在阎匪“国民身分证”大检查，正是做编组抓兵的准备，已有两千工人被编遣威胁驱入匪军中去，要他们舍命捐躯，在我军总攻时“创造奇迹”。对于财物的掠夺，更是无微不至。凡市民可赖以生存的任何一种物品，都列到阎匪所谓“总体战行动纲领”中，包括：“生活的物品、发款征购，储蓄的物品、发证征借，废弃的物品、无价征用”。以至金钱的“动员、捐献、发证捐借”等。阎匪榨取市民最毒辣的一条“妙计”是，一面“手令”伪经管局强制市民集中金银向上海“换取”面粉。据伪民众晚报透露：在九月二十九日到十月一日三天中就搜刮了黄金三万零三百六十八两，白洋两万三千六百余元，白银一千四百余两。另一面密令其财经部门向市民夺取粮食，把物价弄得直线上涨，白面由蒋币七百万一斤，涨到两千万元。高粱面由四百八十万元一斤，涨到一千万元。玉茭面由五百万元一斤，涨到一千一百万元。现在阎匪又要“拿几颗人头”来施行日用品“限价”。阎匪一切措施无不为着掠夺的便利。
    市民不仅没有见到“换取”的面粉，现在连买豆饼或麦麸充饥都困难了。伪机关及官僚资本家经营的工厂，借故裁员编遣，难民比比皆是，饿殍横陈街头。有贫民深夜跳湖自杀，在湖边留下一张凄惨的绝命书，上面写的：“我不幸生存在阎锡山统治的太原，他要我死还得隐姓埋名死去！以免死后祸及家庭”。湖滨常见有面黄肌瘦的弃婴，厉声啼哭，惨不忍闻。昔日名胜的文瀛湖今日已如荒郊，阴森的可怕。
    不少市民既没有房子也没有吃的东西，煤的配给困难。水电都成了奢侈品，照原价增十五倍。杂物抛在阴沟和街道上，发出腐烂的臭味。粪便，滥灰渣如山。繁华的太原城变成一座死城。
    太原市民没有和解放区隔绝起来，解放军的胜利和政策，一直流入市区。阎匪的反动欺骗宣传，受到广大市民暗中的驳斥。能进入太原的每个人或事物，都成为我方政策的传播者。市民，甚至一些下级官兵不避阎匪“严密政治空气”镇压的危险来探听，他们急欲知道解放区的事情。最近从太原孤岛逃来解放区一小学教员谈到下面情形：各阶层对我城市政策了解后，被阎匪所制造的恐惧心情已镇静下来，热情期待我军迅速进入太原解放他们。
