Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 20th—The Zhengzhou Military Control Commission issued a proclamation on the third day after the city's liberation, announcing the dissolution of the Kuomintang, the Three People's Principles Youth League, and all their secret service reactionary organizations. It called on enemy and puppet personnel to immediately register with the municipal authorities, hand over weapons, radios, documents, archives, party membership cards, etc., and declare their withdrawal from these reactionary organizations. Ordinary personnel who are not guilty of heinous crimes will not be prosecuted by the People's Government. Those who continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities will be severely punished once discovered. As of October 27th, 163 people had registered within two and a half days. They not only handed over their own weapons but also secretly reported on the firearms buried in the city by the Kuomintang. They said during registration: "The Kuomintang is destined to fail, and running away is useless. Even if you escape to Xuzhou or Nanjing, won't those places be liberated the same way tomorrow?"

　　郑州宣布解散国民党反动组织
  　敌伪人员纷纷登记
    【新华社中原廿日电】郑州军管会在解放该城后第三日发出布告，宣布解散国民党、三青团及其一切特务反动组织，号召敌伪人员立即向市政当局登记交出武器、电台、文件、档案、党证等，并宣布退出此等反动组织。凡非罪大恶极之普通人员，人民政府将不予追究。如仍继续进行反革命活动者，一经查获，必予严惩。迄十月二十七日止，两天半内，已有一百六十三人报到登记。他们不仅交出了自己的武器，并密告国民党埋藏于本市的枪支。他们在登记时说：“国民党注定要失败了，跑也没用。即使逃到徐州、南京，那些地方明天还不是一样被解放？”
