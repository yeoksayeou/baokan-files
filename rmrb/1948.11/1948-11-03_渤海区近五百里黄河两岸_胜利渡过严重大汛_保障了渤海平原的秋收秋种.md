Xinhua News Agency, East China, 31st: A belated message: The Yellow River section in Bohai, Shandong, has successfully overcome the most severe flood since its return to its old course after more than ten days of intense rescue efforts. Starting from October 2nd, the water level of the Yellow River in this area rose by more than 2 "gongcun" (approx. 2cm) per day, reaching 13.184 meters on the 8th, forming the most severe water situation since the Yellow River returned to its old course. During the major flood, responsible cadres from the Party, government, and military in the counties along the river all went to the embankments to check the water situation, mobilize the masses, and personally participate in carrying straw and pushing soil and throwing stones. The stone dam of the Zhang Xiaotang dangerous section in Bin County collapsed, and most of the "saosao" (protective structures) fell into the river. After throwing more than a thousand cubic meters of stones and 100,000 catties of straw, the situation was turned from danger to safety. At the No. 16 "saoba" (another type of protective structure) of the Zhangjiatan dangerous section in Lijin, there were four major tremors in one day. Cadres from the County Party Committee and the county government and other departments persisted in rescue for four days and three nights before stabilizing it. At the sixteen-li "pinggong" (level embankment) at the estuary of Kenli, which had been repaired in the spring, more than 30 leaks and several small breaches appeared from the 5th to the 7th due to the loose soil. They were blocked and restored after the flood prevention team, cadres, and residents went into the water to rescue them. Beidianzi in Changqing, Gongjia in Lijin, and other places are well-known "bottlenecks," with a river surface width of about 500 meters and a narrow, winding riverbed with dangerous sections side by side. The embankment sections in the newly recovered areas of Jiyang, Qihe, Changqing, and Zhangli (newly established county, parts of Zhangqiu and Licheng), were damaged and riddled with holes by the Kuomintang bandit troops who had occupied the area and dug fortifications. All of the above-mentioned dangerous embankment sections have safely passed the severe test under the intense rescue efforts of the Party, government, military, and people throughout the region. During the rescue, the masses in various counties actively contributed stones and transported materials. Merchants and residents of Beizhen, Putai, contributed more than 300 cubic meters of stone materials overnight, and the masses of Bin County also rushed to transport 100,000 catties of straw in four days. After October 10th, the river water began to recede, and the large embankments on both sides of the 480-kilometer river section stood intact, ensuring the autumn harvest and planting on the Bohai Plain.

    保障了渤海平原的秋收秋种
    【新华社华东三十一日电】迟到消息：山东渤海段黄河，经十余天的紧张抢护，已胜利渡过自归故后最严重的一次大讯。自十月二日起，该处黄河水位每日上涨二公寸以上，至八日水位达十三点一八四公尺，形成黄河归故以来最严重水势。大汛中，沿河各县党政军负责干部，均上堤查看水情，动员民众并亲自参加担运秸料，推土抛石。滨县张肖堂险工石坝塌陷，扫埽大部掉蛰，经抛石千余方和秸料十万斤后，乃转危为安。利津张家滩险工十六号埽坝，一天动荡了四次，中共县委及县府等各部门干部坚持抢救达四天三夜，方才稳住。垦利入海处经过春修的十六里平工，因土质松散，五日至七日漏洞三十余处，决小口数处，经防汛队及干部、居民下水抢护，始行堵复。长清北店子、利津宫家等处均为著名“瓶颈”，河面宽五百公尺左右，河床狭窄多湾，险工比肩；济阳、齐河、长清、章历（新设县，章邱历城各一部）等县新收复区的堤段，均经曾盘据该地的国民党匪军破坏及挖工事，弄得百孔千疮；上述这些堤段险工，此次在全区党政军民紧张抢救下，亦已安全渡过严重考验。在抢护中，各县群众纷纷献石运料。蒲台北镇商民一夜献石料三百多方，滨县群众亦于四天中赶运秸料十万斤。至十月十日后，河水开始退落，四百八十公里河段的两岸大埝，均完整屹立，保障了渤海平原的秋收秋种。
