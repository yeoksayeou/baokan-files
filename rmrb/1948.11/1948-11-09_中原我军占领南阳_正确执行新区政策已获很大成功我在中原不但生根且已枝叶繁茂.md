Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 5th – Under the great victorious offensive of the People's Liberation Army, the enemy troops defending Nanyang, led by Wang Lingyun, abandoned the city and fled south on the afternoon of the 4th. Our army immediately occupied Nanyang. Nanyang was the ancient Wan County, where Cao Cao and Zhang Xiu fought a battle during the Three Kingdoms period. Liu Xiu, the Guangwu Emperor of the Later Han Dynasty, started his uprising against the Wang Mang Dynasty in this area, founding the Later Han Dynasty. The Twenty-Eight Mansions, as they are known in folklore, which were Liu Xiu's twenty-eight main cadres, were mostly born in the Nanyang area. In the past year, the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek attached great importance to Nanyang, establishing a so-called pacification zone with Wang Lingyun as commander, attempting to block the People's Liberation Army's southward advance. Last month, the White bandit Chongxi used the strength of three armies of the Huang Wei Corps, managing it for a whole month, attempting to open up the transportation route between Xinyang and Nanyang, but ultimately failed to achieve its goal. Recently, the Chiang bandits, due to the overall deterioration of the situation, were forced to concentrate nearly a hundred divisions of troops from the entire southern front in two areas centered on Xuzhou and Wuhan. Two weeks ago, they abandoned Kaifeng, and now they have abandoned Nanyang. From now on, the entire territory of Henan, except for Xinxiang and Anyang in northern Henan, Lingbao and Lushi in western Henan, and Queshan, Xinyang, Huangchuan, Guangshan, Shangcheng, and Gushi in southern Henan, where there are still remnants of the enemy, has been completely liberated by us. Since the South Line People's Liberation Army began its heroic advance into the enemy's rear in July last year, in more than a year, in addition to annihilating a large number of Kuomintang regular troops, the greatest achievement has been the restoration and establishment of solid base areas in the Dabie Mountains (Hubei-Henan Area), Western Anhui Area, Western Henan Area, Southern Shaanxi Area, Tongbai Area, Jianghan Area, and Jianghuai Area (i.e., the area around eastern Anhui), the creation of seven military districts, and the great expansion of the old base area of the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Military Region. Except for the Jianghuai Military Region, which is under the jurisdiction of the Northern Jiangsu Military Region, all other military districts are under the jurisdiction of the Central Plains Military Region. The Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Area, Western Henan Area, Southern Shaanxi Area, and Tongbai Area are now connected into one piece, without enemy obstruction. These four military districts are also connected to North China. Our armed forces, in addition to replenishing the losses of the field armies and local armies in more than a year of fierce fighting, have also increased by about 200,000 men, and will have even greater development in the future. The White bandit Chongxi often said, "I'm not afraid of the Communists being fierce, I'm only afraid of the Communists taking root." He was right to be afraid. In all the areas of the Jianghuai and Han rivers, we are not just trees, but forests. We have not only taken root, but have also grown luxuriantly. In a very short period in the second half of last year, we prematurely implemented the policy of land distribution in this area, committing some tactical leftist errors, but we immediately corrected them, universally using the experience of the Anti-Japanese War, and implemented the social policy of rent and interest reduction and the financial policy of reasonable burdens for all classes. In this way, all social strata that could be united or neutralized were united or neutralized, concentrating forces to oppose the Kuomintang reactionary ruling forces and the few local bullies who were most hated by the vast majority of the masses. This tactic has been clearly successful, and the enemy has been completely isolated. Under the coordinated attacks of our powerful field armies and local armies, the enemies trapped in isolated strongholds, such as Kaifeng and Nanyang, were forced to abandon their cities and flee. The troops led by Wang Lingyun, the enemy defending Nanyang, are the Second Army, the Sixty-fourth Army, and some militia groups, and are now fleeing towards Xiangyang. Xiangyang is also a so-called "pacification zone" of the Kuomintang. After the first commander, Kang Ze, was captured, Song Xilian, who was transferred from Xinjiang, took over. Recently, Song Xilian was promoted to deputy commander-in-chief of Xuzhou and director of the front-line command post to replace Du Yuming, the original incumbent. Du Yuming had just flown from Xuzhou to the Northeast, suffered a defeat in one battle, and fled to Huludao. Wang Lingyun's arrival in Xiangyang is probably to replace Song Xilian as commander. But from Nanyang to Xiangyang is not a long distance, Xiangyang is still an isolated stronghold, and if Wang Lingyun does not flee again, Kang Ze's fate is waiting for him.

　　中原我军占领南阳
    正确执行新区政策已获很大成功我在中原不但生根且已枝叶繁茂
    【新华社郑州五日电】在人民解放军伟大的胜利的攻势下，南阳守敌王凌云于四日下午弃城南逃，我军当即占领南阳。南阳为古宛县，三国时曹操与张绣曾于此城发生争夺战。后汉光武帝刘秀，曾于此地起兵，发动反对王莽王朝的战争，创立了后汉王朝。民间所传二十八宿，即刘秀的二十八个主要干部，多是出生于南阳一带。在过去一年中，匪首蒋介石极重视南阳，曾于此设立所谓绥靖区，以王凌云为司令官，企图阻遏人民解放军向南发展的道路。上月，白匪崇禧使用黄维兵团三个军的力量，经营整月，企图打通信阳、南阳间的运输道路，始终未能达到目的。最近蒋匪因全局败坏，被迫将整个南部战线近百个师的兵力集中于以徐州为中心和以汉口为中心的两个地区，两星期前已放弃开封，现又放弃南阳。从此，河南全境除豫北之新乡、安阳，豫西之灵宝、阅乡，豫南之确山、信阳、潢川、光山、商城、固始等地尚有残敌外，已全部为我解放。去年七月，南线人民解放军开始向敌后实行英勇的进军以来，一年多时间内，除歼灭了大量的国民党正规部队以外，最大的成绩，就是在大别山区（鄂豫区）、皖西区、豫西区、陕南区、桐柏区、江汉区、江淮区（即皖东一带）恢复和建立了稳固的根据地，创立了七个军区，并极大地扩大了豫皖苏军区老根据地。除江淮军区属于苏北军区管辖外，其余各军区，统属于中原军区管辖。豫皖苏区、豫西区、陕南区、桐柏区现已联成一片，没有敌人的阻隔。这四个军区并已和华北联成一片。我武装力量，除补上野战军和地方军一年多激烈战争的消耗以外，还增加了大约二十万人左右，今后当有更大的发展。白匪崇禧经常说：“不怕共产党凶，只怕共产党生根，”他是怕对了。我们在所有江淮河汉区域，不仅是树木，而且是森林了。不仅生了根，而且枝叶茂盛了。在去年下半年的一个极短时间内，我们在这一区域曾经过早地执行分配土地的政策，犯了一些策略上的左的错误，但是随即纠正了，普遍地利用了抗日时期的经验，执行了减租减息的社会政策和各阶层合理负担的财政政策。这样，就将一切可能联合或中立的社会阶层，均联合或中立起来，集中力量，反对国民党反动统治势力及乡村中为最广大群众所痛恨的少数恶霸分子。这一策略，是明显地成功了，敌人已经完全孤立起来。在我强大的野战军和地方军配合打击之下，困守各个孤立据点内的敌人，如象开封、南阳等处，不得不被迫弃城逃窜。南阳守敌王凌云统率的军队是第二军、第六十四军以及一些民团，现向襄阳逃窜。襄阳也是国民党的一个所谓“绥靖区”，第一任司令官康泽被俘后，接手的是从新疆调来的宋希濂。最近宋希濂升任了徐州的副总司令兼前线指挥所主任去代替原任的杜聿明。杜聿明则刚从徐州飞到东北，一战遂败，又逃到了葫芦岛。王凌云到襄阳，大概是接替宋希濂当司令官。但是从南阳到襄阳，并没有走得多远，襄阳还是一个孤立据点，王凌云如不再逃，康泽的命运是在等着他的。
