Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. Following the collapse of the "price control" policy, the Kuomintang government has been forced to publicly declare the complete failure of its "currency reform" plan. The puppet Executive Yuan passed two "amendment" measures on the 8th and 11th of this month, respectively, to replace the "Gold Yuan Coupon Issuance Measures" and "Measures for Handling Gold, Silver and Foreign Currencies Owned by the People," which were originally issued as "Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Disposal." The "amendment" measures explicitly admit the fact that the puppet Gold Yuan Coupon has depreciated sharply, reducing the ratio of Gold Yuan Coupon to the US dollar from four to one to twenty to one, and the ratio to silver dollars from two to one to ten to one, devaluing it by eighty percent. At the same time, the provisions in the original "Gold Yuan Coupon Issuance Measures" that "the amount of Gold Yuan Coupons issued shall be limited to 2 billion yuan" and that the amount of Gold Yuan Coupons issued shall be announced monthly have been revoked, opening the door for the wanton expansion of Gold Yuan Coupons in the future. The other "amendment" is that after robbing nearly 200 million US dollars of private gold, silver, and foreign currency, it was re-announced that "gold, silver, and foreign currency are allowed to be held by the people," and silver coins can be freely circulated for buying and selling.

The "currency reform" implemented by the Kuomintang government since August 19th, a major expansion, plunder, and fraud, has dragged the Kuomintang-controlled area's economy into a quagmire of real total collapse in just over two months. Due to massive over-issuance, the speed of the collapse of the pseudo-Gold Yuan Coupon's credit has far surpassed that of the old legal tender. In less than twenty days from mid-October to the end of October, the pseudo-Gold Yuan Coupon depreciated by eighty percent at once. The Kuomintang bandit gang's violent "price control" policy failed to prevent this rapid collapse of the pseudo-Gold Yuan Coupon. On the contrary, it further stimulated the rise in prices, and finally overwhelmed this violent "price control" policy, causing the prices in the Kuomintang area to skyrocket uncontrollably. Taking the price of rice in Shanghai as an example, when the price control was lifted on November 1st, the price per *shi* was 80 pseudo-Gold Yuan Coupons, but in less than ten days to the 9th, it had risen to 1,800 yuan, a sharp increase of more than 21 times. If calculated from the "August 19th price control," it has soared more than 84 times. This multiple increase in less than three months is 22 times higher than the total multiple increase of 62 times in the nearly eight months from the beginning of this year to the "currency reform" before August 19th. This shows the speed of the bankruptcy of the pseudo-Gold Yuan Coupon and the scale of the deterioration of the economic situation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and also shows the reasons why the Kuomintang bandit gang had to admit the failure of the "currency reform."

In this "amendment" measure of the Kuomintang government, it is stipulated that the Gold Yuan Coupon shall be pegged to the US dollar at a ratio of twenty to one. In fact, the black market for US dollars in Shanghai had exceeded this ratio on November 4th. The Kuomintang government is trying to salvage the increasingly bankrupt credit of its "Gold Yuan Coupon" by issuing "Gold Yuan" and spreading a false impression of implementing a gold standard currency, stipulating that "the Gold Yuan is the standard currency, which is cast by the government and issued by the Central Bank," and stipulating that "the value of the Gold Yuan" is equal to the "Gold Yuan Coupon." However, the "amendment" clause does not stipulate that holders of "Gold Yuan Coupons" can freely exchange "Gold Yuan" at a ratio of one to one. This exposes the falsity of the gold standard currency. The "Gold Yuan" fairy tale cannot support the credit of the pseudo-Gold Yuan Coupon.

This time the Kuomintang government's struggling action, as a British newspaper said, is "putting a band-aid on an earthquake." It cannot alleviate its economic collapse, but will only accelerate its collapse. The Kuomintang bandit gang can no longer find a way to escape this total financial and economic collapse.

### 国民党政府公开宣告　“币改”全盘失败

　　国民党政府公开宣告
  　“币改”全盘失败
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】紧随“限价”政策破产之后，国民党政府又不得不公开宣告其“改革币制”计划的全盘失败。伪行政院已于本月八日及十一日分别通过两项“修正”办法，以代替原来作为“财政经济紧急处分令”发布的“金圆券发行办法”和“人民所有金银外币处理办法”。“修正”办法中明白供认伪金圆券急剧贬值的事实，而将金圆券与美元的比率由四比一降为二十比一，与银圆的比率由二比一降为十比一，使其贬值百分之八十。同时并将原“金圆券发行办法”中“金圆券发行数额以二十亿元为限”和按月公告金圆券发行数额的规定撤销，为今后金圆券的肆意膨胀大开了方便之门。而另一“修正”，则是于抢劫了近二亿美元的民间金、银、外币之后，重新宣布“黄金、白银、外币准许人民持有”，银币可以自由流通买卖。
    八月十九日起国民党政府所实行的“改革币制”这个大膨胀、大掠夺和大骗局，仅仅两个多月，已经将国民党统治区经济拖入了真正总崩溃的泥坑。由于大量滥发的结果，伪金圆券信用崩溃的速度早已非旧法币时期所能比拟。从十月中旬到十月底的不到二十天中伪金圆券一下子贬值了百分之八十。国民党匪帮的暴力“限价”政策，既未能阻止住伪金圆券的这种迅速崩溃，相反地更刺激了物价的上涨，最后终于冲垮了这一暴力“限价”政策，并使国民党区的物价狂涨到不可收拾。以上海米价为例，十一月一日取消限价时，每石售价为伪金圆券八十元，而到九日的不到十天中，则已涨达一千八百元，猛涨二十一倍以上。如从“八一九限价”算起，则已飞涨了八十四倍以上。这个不到三个月中间的上倍数，较之本年初至八一九“币改”前的近八个月中的上涨总倍数六十二倍，尚高出二十二倍。这就可以看出伪金圆券破产的速度和国民党统治区经济情况恶化的规模，同时也可看出国民党匪帮不得不承认“币改”失败的原因。
    国民党政府这一次的“修正”办法中，规定将金圆券以二十比一的比价钉住美元，事实上十一月四日上海美金黑市便已超过这一比价。国民党政府又企图以发行“金圆”，散布一种实行金本位币的假象来挽救其日益破产的“金圆券”的信用，规定“以金圆为本位币，由政府铸造，交中央银行发行”，并规定“金圆”与“金圆券”的价值相等。但是“修正”条文中却并未规定“金圆券”的持有者可以按一比一的比价自由兑换“金圆”。这就暴露了金本位币的虚假。“金圆”的童话，决不能支持伪金圆券的信用。
    国民党政府这一次的挣扎举动，正如英国一家报纸所说是“地震上贴膏药”，它不仅不能缓和其经济的崩溃，相反地只有加速其崩溃。国民党匪帮现在是再也找不出逃脱这个财政经济总崩溃的办法了。
