　　Some Villages in Yuanshi
  　End Land Reform Simply and Roughly
  　County Party Committee Issues Circular Criticizing and Correcting
    [Taihang Electric] In Yuanshi, during the continued completion of land reform in the new areas and the conclusion of land work in the semi-old areas, erroneous work styles of simply completing tasks, being careless, and acting as substitutes and taking over were prevalent, causing detours in the work. For example, in the sixth district, the work groups in the Dongzhang and Songcao base points in the new area, after arriving in the villages, did not explain the work tasks to the masses. They set aside the village cadres, Party members, activists, and even cadres who had studied policies in the county, and delved into individual interviews with the masses. As a result, they caused panic among the middle peasants, suspicion among the cadres, and a lack of clarity among the poor and hired peasants. Many people reflected, "These people don't know what they're here to do." Therefore, they dared not approach them. The work groups also felt the work was difficult and lost confidence in mobilizing the masses. In the Chengguan district, at the Yuanzhuang base point, they also did not pay attention to cultivating backbones and activists at the beginning, and the work group worked alone. As a result, they spent a lot of effort but achieved little. The Beiyan base point (semi-old area) in the sixth district, on the pretext of short time and many tasks, did not conduct a good discussion of the policy of ending land reform in the branch, and then convened a village cadre meeting, and then forced the masses to hold a meeting to elect people's representatives. The election was not based on citizen groups, but a general meeting election. Because the masses were not sufficiently prepared ideologically, the elected representatives were not satisfied by the masses. In the first district, the Dongtaicheng and Kuangcun base points (semi-old areas), in order to win the election of Party members as representatives, the cadres in the citizen groups put forward the names that had been determined in advance, and everyone "agreed" to it, which was considered a representative, which was met with dissatisfaction from the masses. In addition, many people also believed that whoever was elected as a representative was "teasing" whomever, and some of the elected Party members said they would not do it. Based on the above situation, the County Party Committee Office issued a circular to all localities, criticizing these erroneous practices. The district committees have also begun to check this period of work and seriously correct it. The two base points such as Beiyan Village in the sixth district have re-elected people's representatives through careful discussion by the masses and re-election by the citizen groups. The Dongzhang Village and Songcao base points in the new district have also corrected the practice of separating from the backbone and separating from the masses, and applied the trained cadres and activists. Relying on the original foundation of poor and hired peasant organizations, they have carried out rectification and development. The First District Committee also reviewed the deviations that occurred at the meeting, and strengthened the education of the branch on contacting the masses, emphasizing that the resolutions of the branch should be transformed into the things of the masses, and the active work of Party members should be used to unite and educate the masses and lead the masses to complete the work.

　　元氏某些村庄
  　结束土改简单粗糙
  　县委通报批判纠正
    【太行电】元氏在新区继续完成土改及半老区结束土地工作中，发生了单纯完成任务、粗枝大叶、代替包办的错误作风，工作走了弯路。如六区在新区的东张、宋曹两个基点的工作组，到村后未向群众说明工作任务是什么，便把村干党员积极分子以至在县学习过政策的干部一律撇开，一头钻到群众中去，进行个别访问，结果引起中农恐慌，干部怀疑，贫雇农摸不清底。不少群众反映：“这伙人不知道来这里干什么来了”。因此不敢接近他们。工作组也感到工作棘手，丧失了发动群众的信心，城关区在原庄基点，开始也是没有注意培养骨干与积极分子，只是工作组独干，结果费力不小，成绩不大，六区北岩基点（半老区）借口时间短，任务多，结束土改政策未在支部作很好讨论，就召开村干部大会，后又强制群众开会选举人代会。选举不是以公民小组为单位，而是大会选举。因群众思想准备不够，结果选出的代表为群众不满。一区东台城与旷村基点（半老区）为争取党员选上代表，在公民小组内由干部把事先确定好了的名字提出来，大家“同意”一下就算成了代表，遭到群众不满。另外也有不少群众认为选上谁当代表就是“捉弄”谁，被选上的部分党员说啥也不干。根据以上情况，该县县委办公室特通报各地，批判了这些错误的做法。各区分委会也开始对这一段工作进行检查，认真纠正。六区北岩村等两基点都重新慎重的经过群众酝酿讨论，经公民小组重选了人民代表。新区的东张村及宋曹基点也纠正了脱离骨干、脱离群众的包办代替作法，把受过训的干部积极分子运用起来。依靠旧有的贫雇组织基础，进行了整顿与发展。一区分委会上也对所发生的偏向作了检讨，并对支部加强了联系群众的教育，强调了要由支部的决议变成群众的东西，以党员的积极工作来团结与教育群众，领导群众完成工作。（指方）
