Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 21st: TASS Berlin, November 18th: The leadership of the German Communist Party recently issued a statement regarding the 24-hour general strike held by workers in the Western Allied occupation zones of Germany on the 12th. The statement said that more than seven million workers responded to the call of the trade unions and resolutely and consistently participated in the 24-hour protest strike, which was the first time since 1933. This protest strike was against the anti-people price and wage policies pursued by Erhard (referred to as the chairman of the so-called State Council) and Pünder (referred to as the chairman of the so-called Administrative Council, i.e., the cabinet, of the Allied occupation zones), and against the bourgeois majority in the Economic Council (referred to as the lower house of the so-called parliament of the Allied occupation zones) and the Social Democratic ministers in the State Council (referred to as the upper house of the so-called parliament of the Allied occupation zones) who supported the policies of the Economic Council. The protest was also directed at the Marshall Plan and its consequences for the working people of Germany, and at the profiteers who made fortunes through war and monetary reform and who sought only profit at the expense of the country's economic recovery. The statement further pointed out that the consistency of this protest strike demonstrated the strength of the workers' movement. It first of all proved that the German working masses would no longer tolerate the policies of the monopoly capitalists and that they were prepared to fight against the reactionary economic policies. The statement concluded by calling on workers to persist in the struggle for an immediate increase in the wages of workers and low-paid employees.

　　西德总罢工的一致性
    证明职工运动力量强大
  　德共号召工人坚持斗争
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社柏林十八日讯：德国共产党领导机构顷就西德联合占领区工人于十二日举行二十四小时总罢工一事发表声明称：七百万以上的工人响应工会呼吁，坚决而一致地参加二十四小时抗议罢工，这还是一九三三年以来的第一次。这一抗议罢工是反对由艾哈德（按系所谓州委员会的主席）和普恩德（按系联合占领区所谓行政委员会亦即内阁的主席）所奉行的敌视人民的物价和工资政策的，是反对经济委员会（按即联合占领区所谓议会的下院）中资产阶级多数派和在州委员会（按即联合占领区所谓议会的上院）上支持经济委员会政策的社会民主党部长们的。抗议也是对着马歇尔计划及其带给德国劳动人民的后果，并对着借战争与货币改革而发财和唯利是图以致损害国家经济复兴的投机牟利者的。该声明进而指出，这一抗议罢工的一致性，证明了职工运动的力量。它首先证明德国劳动大众已不再容忍独占资本家的政策了，他们已准备对反动派的经济政策作斗争。声明最后号召工人坚持为立即增加工人及低薪雇员的薪资而斗争。
