    International Common Knowledge
　　Truman and Barkley
    Harry Truman, elected President of the United States in the November 2nd U.S. election, is a docile running dog of Wall Street financial magnates. Truman was born in 1884 in a rural area near Kansas City, Missouri, and is now 64 years old. He studied music as a teenager, but failed due to lack of talent. He was drafted into the army in 1917 and was a mediocre artillery captain. After being discharged, he opened a cloth and general store in Kansas City, which failed due to poor management and went bankrupt. After failing in business, he decided to engage in political activities, currying favor with Pendergast, a Democratic Party member in Kansas City. Pendergast successively appointed him as road inspector and local judge. In 1934, he was "elected" to the Senate through Pendergast's vote rigging. He remained mediocre and unknown for ten years. In July 1944, a fierce struggle occurred at the Democratic Party convention regarding the vice-presidential candidate. The progressive camp, led by Roosevelt, supported Wallace's re-election, while the reactionary faction, led by the Southern Democrats, supported Byrnes. As a result of the stalemate, both sides agreed to have the uncharismatic Truman serve as Vice President. In April 1945, Roosevelt passed away, and the position of President of the United States fell to Truman.
    As everyone knows, Truman is a mediocre person. The number of times he has been ridiculed is the highest of any U.S. president. But he has two "talents." The first is the "talent" of being docile to his masters and striving to satisfy Wall Street. To this end, he has repeatedly stated that he is a "warrior" in the anti-Soviet and anti-communist crusade. As everyone knows, the day after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, he told the press: "If Germany wins, we will aid the Soviet Union; if the Soviet Union wins, we will aid Germany, let them slaughter each other as much as possible." After the war, he abandoned Roosevelt's policy of international cooperation, abandoned international agreements, and actively promoted Wall Street's aggressive policies. The notorious Truman Doctrine, proposed last March, was an open declaration of American expansionism attempting to seize world hegemony after the war. He excluded all true successors to Roosevelt's policies, and appointed Wall Street bankers such as Forrestal, Lovett, and Draper, as well as military leaders such as Leahy and Marshall, to formulate and implement reactionary policies and laws such as "getting tough on the Soviet Union," "aiding" the Kuomintang reactionaries, "aiding" the Greek and Turkish royalists, and the "Marshall Plan," actively preparing for a new war. This policy has enabled Wall Street financial magnates, who make fortunes through war, to make huge profits. Truman's second "talent" is speculation and deception. He is the president in American history who has intervened in workers' strikes the most times, and he is overly zealous in implementing the Taft-Hartley Act, but during the election campaign, he pretended to sympathize with workers and oppose this anti-labor law. He actively trampled on human rights, frantically persecuted communists and progressives, and refused to end racial segregation in the military, but he pretended to support protecting human rights and oppose mistreating black people. Wallace made a very pertinent comment about him in his October 30th speech, saying: "When he was president, he frantically curried favor with Wall Street, and when he was a candidate, he frantically curried favor with the people."
    Barkley, who was elected Vice President at the same time as Truman, is from Kentucky, born in 1877 and is now 71 years old. He was elected as a member of the House of Representatives in 1913 and served for fourteen consecutive years. He was elected as a senator in 1927 and has served until now. He is the leader of the Democratic Party in the Senate and a politician who has been in the American political arena for many years, changing his position according to the situation. During the Roosevelt era, he was one of the "New Dealers." Now, when Truman is in power, he has become a supporter of Truman's "aid" to the Greek and Turkish bill and the bill restricting workers' strikes.

    国际常识
　　杜鲁门与巴克莱
    十一月二日在美国大选中被选为美国总统的哈利·杜鲁门，是华尔街财阀的一名驯服走狗。杜鲁门一八八四年生于密苏里州堪萨斯城附近的农村中，现年六十四岁。少年时曾习音乐，以才能不足，未成。一九一七年被召入伍。为一平庸的炮兵上尉。退伍后，在堪萨斯城开了一爿布匹杂货店，以经营无方，蚀本倒闭。经商失败后，他决定从事政治活动，巴结上了堪萨斯城民主党党员彭德加斯特。彭氏先后委他以道路监察员、地方法官等职。一九三四年，在彭氏伪造选票下，他被“选”入参院。十年间庸碌无闻。一九四四年七月，民主党大会上关于副总统候选人的问题曾发生激烈斗争。以罗斯福为首的进步阵营支持华莱士连任，以南方民主党为首的反动派支持贝纳斯，相持结果，双方同意由色彩不鲜明的杜鲁门出任副总统。一九四五年四月，罗斯福逝世，于是，美国总统的职位，就落到杜鲁门的头上。
    尽人皆知，杜鲁门是一个庸碌之徒。他受人嘘嗤的次数，为美国历届总统之冠。但是他有两种“才能”。第一种是对主子驯服，竭力使华尔街满意的“才能”。为此，他一再表示他是反苏反共十字军的“勇士”。大家知道，一九四一年六月德国侵苏战争爆发后的第二日，他曾向报界谈称：“如果德国胜利，我们即援助苏联，如果苏联胜利，我们即援助德国，让他们彼此尽量残杀。”战后，他背弃了罗斯福的国际合作政策，毁弃国际协议，积极推行华尔街的侵略政策。去年三月提出臭名远扬的杜鲁门主义，就是战后美国企图攫取世界霸权的扩张主义的公开宣告。他排斥了一切罗斯福政策的真正继承者，起用了福莱斯特尔、罗维特、德莱伯等华尔街银行家和李海、马歇尔等军阀，制订与执行着“对苏强硬”、“援助”国民党反动派、“援助”希土保皇党及“马歇尔计划”等反动政策与法案，积极准备新的战争。这一政策使靠战争发财的华尔街财阀，大发其财。杜鲁门的第二种“才能”是投机与欺骗。他是美国历史上干涉工人罢工次数最多的总统，执行塔夫脱——哈特莱法案唯恐不力，但他在竞选中却装成同情工人和反对这个反劳工法案的姿态。他积极蹂躏人权，疯狂地迫害共产党与进步人士，拒绝在军队中停止种族隔离制度，但他却装成赞成保障人权和反对虐待黑人。华莱士在十月三十日的演说中，对他作了很中肯的评语说：“他在做总统的时候，疯狂地巴结华尔街，而在做候选人的时候，则疯狂地巴结人民。”
    与杜鲁门同时当选为副总统的巴克莱，是肯塔基州人，生于一八七七年，现年七十一岁。一九一三年当选为众议员，连任十四年。一九二七年当选为参议员，以迄于今。他是参院民主党的领袖，是一个在美国官场混了多年的看风转舵的政客。罗斯福时代，他曾是“新政派”之一。现在，当杜鲁门执政时，他又成为杜氏的“援助”希土法案和限制工人罢工法案的拥护者了。
