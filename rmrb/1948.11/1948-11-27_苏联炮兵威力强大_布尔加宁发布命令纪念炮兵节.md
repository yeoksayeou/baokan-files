Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. TASS, Moscow, 20th. Soviet Minister of Armed Forces Bulganin issued the following order for Artillery Day:

Comrades artillerymen and artillery industry workers! Comrades soldiers and non-commissioned officers of the Army and Navy! Comrades officers and generals of the Army and Navy!

Today, the Soviet people and their armed forces commemorate Artillery Day and celebrate the achievements of artillerymen and artillery industry workers in strengthening the combat power of the motherland's armed forces. On this festive occasion, I extend my respects and congratulations to you. I hope that all artillery personnel in the armed forces, men and women workers in the artillery industry, designers, technicians, and engineers will achieve new successes in further developing and strengthening the combat power of Soviet artillery.

In commemoration of Artillery Day, I order: Today, November 21st, a 20-gun salute will be fired in the capital of the motherland, Moscow, in the capitals of the allied republics, and in the cities of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sevastopol, Odessa, Khabarovsk, Novosibirsk, Sverdlovsk, Gorky, Molotov, and Tula.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. Moscow Dispatch: Soviet Artillery Lieutenant General Prochko wrote an article for TASS stating: During the Patriotic War, artillery played a significant role in the brilliant victories of the Soviet armed forces. The achievements of Soviet artillery in World War II are an indicator of the overall Soviet military power and the growth of the technical equipment of its armed forces. It is enough to point out that in the last three years of the war, Soviet industry supplied the army with as many as 120,000 cannons and 100,000 mortars each year. During the war, artillery was the main attacking force of the Soviet army and a powerful firearm on which the Soviet army relied to destroy the enemy's most fortified fortifications and annihilate its manpower and military equipment. The Battle of Stalingrad was a victory for the power of Soviet artillery. There, Soviet artillery personnel destroyed nearly 1,600 German tanks. At Kursk and Belgorod, at Kharkov and Kiev, at Leningrad and Minsk, at Kishinev and Iasi, artillery was the force that ensured victory over the German army. During the Battle of Berlin, 22,000 cannons and mortars joined the battle in a small area of the front. Never in history has artillery been so concentrated. In all military operations of the Soviet army, artillery personnel cooperated closely and effectively with infantry, cavalry, tanks, and aircraft at all stages of the battle. The principle of using Soviet artillery in the last war was to concentrate firepower. The assault and anti-tank artillery units established during the war in accordance with Stalin's instructions were powerful tools in the hands of the Soviet command in organizing strong and impenetrable anti-tank defenses. The power of assault and anti-tank artillery grew day by day, and even the densest German tanks could not withstand it. By the end of the war against fascist Germany and imperialist Japan, Soviet artillery had increased more than fivefold compared to peacetime. Soviet artillery accurately fulfilled their duty to the country in the fierce war against the enemy. The Soviet government highly valued their courageous achievements. More than 1,600 artillery soldiers, officers, and generals were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, and more than 1.2 million artillery personnel were awarded various Soviet medals and awards. Many large and small artillery units were incorporated into the Guards.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. TASS dispatch: On the eve of Soviet Artillery Day, Lieutenant General Boganov, the president of the Academy of Artillery Science, gave an interview to a reporter from Literature Gazette, pointing out the important role and great achievements of Soviet artillery in the last war. According to materials from the Soviet Information Bureau, Germany lost a total of 70,000 tanks by the end of the third year of the last war. All of these were destroyed by Soviet artillery. Under the leadership of the brilliant strategist Stalin, Soviet artillery had already won the last battle. All kinds of war instigators and aggressors should remember this. The success of Soviet artillery in the last world war is proof of the continuous progress of Russian artillery science. Since the October Revolution, Russian artillery science has reached a higher level. Soviet scientists Drozdov and Academician Krylov solved the most complex problems regarding artillery. During the several Stalin Five-Year Plans, artillery designers such as Grabin, Krupchanikov, Petrov, and Ivanov, who won the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, emerged. We started developing rockets at the same time as Germany and Britain. German designers adopted the policy of designing long-range aggressive strategic weapons, but the fact proved that all these "V" weapons did not play a decisive role in the war. Britain paid attention to rockets during the aerial blockade of London. But their attempts to invent anti-aircraft rockets were rarely effective. Soviet scientific thought was active in a decisive direction. We invented military rockets that directly affected the outcome of the war. Our powerful mobile rocket mortar known as "Katyusha" was truly a terror to the enemy. Throughout its history, artillery has always had countermeasures when encountering new weapons of the enemy, which is a characteristic of artillery. With armor, there are armor-piercing shells. With the air force, there are anti-aircraft guns. To deal with tanks, there are anti-tank guns. Soviet science has created irresistible new types of artillery. Mr. Boganov concluded that Soviet designers have made great achievements in anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft guns.

　　苏联炮兵威力强大
  　布尔加宁发布命令纪念炮兵节
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：苏联武装部队部部长布尔加宁发布炮兵节命令如下：
    炮兵及炮兵工业工人同志们！陆海军战士及士官同志们！陆海军校尉及将军同志们！
    今天，苏维埃人民和他们的武装部队纪念炮兵节，并庆祝炮兵及炮兵工业工人们在加强祖国武装部队作战力量上的成就。值此节日，我谨向你们致敬并表庆贺。我盼望武装部队中的全体炮兵人员，炮兵工业中的男女工人、设计家、技师及工程师们，在进一步发展与加强苏维埃炮兵作战力量上获得新的成就。
    为纪念炮兵节，我命令：今天，十一月二十一日，在祖国首都莫斯科、在各加盟共和国首都、在列宁格勒、斯大林格勒、悉瓦斯托波尔、敖德萨、伯力、新西伯利亚、斯维尔德罗夫斯克、高尔基、莫洛托夫及图拉等城各鸣礼炮二十响。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】莫斯科讯：苏联炮兵中将普罗契科为塔斯社撰文称：在爱国战争期间，炮兵在苏联武装部队的辉煌胜利中起了显著的作用。苏维埃炮兵在第二次世界大战中的成就，是整个苏维埃的军事威力及其武装部队技术装备增长的指标。只要指出这点就够了：在战争最后三年中，苏维埃工业每年以十二万门那样多的大炮和十万门那样多的迫击炮供给军队。战争期间，炮兵是苏军的主要攻击力量，而且是强大的火器，苏军就靠这种火器来摧毁敌人最强固的工事，歼灭其有生力量及军事装备。斯大林格勒之战，是苏维埃炮兵威力的胜利。在那里，苏维埃炮兵人员摧毁了几达一千六百辆德国坦克。在库尔斯克及比尔哥罗德，在哈尔科夫及基辅，在列宁格勒及明斯克，在基什涅夫及雅西，炮兵是确保战胜德军的力量。柏林之战时，在前线的一个小地带，就有二万二千门大炮与迫击炮加入作战。在历史上，炮兵从未有过这样的集中。在苏军的一切军事行动中，炮兵人员都紧密地、有效能地与步兵、骑兵、坦克和飞机在战役进展的一切阶段中合作。上次战争中，使用苏维埃炮兵的原则就是集中火力。遵照斯大林训令在战争中成立的攻坚与反坦克的炮兵部队，是苏维埃统帅部在组织强固的、不可通过的反坦克防御时所掌握的强有力的工具。攻坚与反坦克炮兵的威力逐日增长，而且甚至德国最密集的坦克都敌不过它。反对法西斯德国及帝国主义日本的战争将近结束时，苏维埃炮兵已比和平时期增加五倍多。苏维埃炮兵在对敌人的猛烈战争中，确切地完成了他们对国家的天职。苏联政府极其珍视他们勇猛的功绩，有一千六百余名炮兵士兵、校尉及将军们荣获苏联英雄的称号，一百二十余万名炮兵人员荣获苏联各种勋章和奖章，许多大小炮兵部队被编警卫部队。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社讯：在苏联炮兵节日的前夕，炮兵科学院院长勃冈拉伏夫中将对文学报记者发表谈话，指出苏联炮兵在上次战争中的重要作用和伟大功绩。根据苏联情报局的材料，上次战争至第三年末德国共损失坦克七万辆。这都是苏联炮兵所毁的。在天才战略家斯大林的领导下，苏联炮兵已在上次决斗中取得胜利。各种各样的战争鼓动者和侵略者应该记住这一点。在上次世界战争中，苏联炮兵的成功就是俄罗斯炮兵科学不断进步的证明。自十月革命以来，俄罗斯炮兵科学达到了更高的水平。苏联科学家德罗兹多夫和科学院会员克里洛夫解决了关于大炮的最复杂的问题。在几个斯大林五年计划当中，出现了如格拉宾、克鲁普查尼科夫、比特罗夫、荣获社会主义劳动英雄称号的伊凡诺夫等大炮设计家。我们与德国、英国同时开始发展火箭。德国的设计家，采取了设计长射程侵略性战略武器的方针，但事实证明，所有这一切“Ｖ”式武器在战争中起不了决定的作用。英国在伦敦空中封锁期间曾注意火箭。但他们发明防空火箭的企图很少收效。苏维埃科学思想则在决定性的方向上进行活动。我们发明了随军火箭，直接影响了战争的结果。我们的强有力的机动的称号“喀秋莎”的火箭迫击炮，确是名符其实地是敌人的恐怖。炮兵在其整个历史上，在遇到敌方的新武器时，它总是有对抗的办法，这是炮兵的特点。有了装甲，就有穿甲炮。有了空军，就有高射炮。对付坦克，就有反坦克炮。苏联科学已创造了无可抵抗的新型炮。勃氏结语称，苏联设计家，在反坦克炮和高射炮方面有伟大成就。
