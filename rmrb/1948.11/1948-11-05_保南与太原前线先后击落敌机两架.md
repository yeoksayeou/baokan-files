    [Jizhong Front Dispatch, 1st] On October 28th, when our army was blocking the enemy advancing south from Baoding, we shot down an enemy fighter plane at Fangshun Bridge, 25 miles southwest of Baoding. The fuselage was destroyed and fell near Dagudian, southwest of Baoding.
    [Report from this newspaper] On the afternoon of the 2nd, a P-51 aircraft of the U.S. imperialists aiding Chiang Kai-shek was shot down by the ground forces of the People's Liberation Army on the Taiyuan front and crashed in a certain area of our North China Liberated Area. Second Lieutenant pilot Wang Shurong has been captured. The plane was equipped with six machine guns and a radio. The aircraft number is 2294, belonging to the First Detachment of the 22nd Squadron of the 4th Air Force Group of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Beiping. It had just been withdrawn from Shenyang to Beiping on the 29th of last month. The pilot, Wang Shurong, is 28 years old, lives in Beiping, and is originally from Damazizhuang, Yongqing County, Hebei Province. He was trained at the U.S. Army Aviation School for one year. After returning to China in 1946, he was incorporated into the 4th Air Force Group of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and used by the Kuomintang reactionaries to attack the people of Northeast China.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 31st] Yang Peiguang (formerly mistakenly reported as Yang Peiguang), a captain of the 23rd Squadron of the Kuomintang Air Force's 4th Group, who flew a P-51 aircraft from Beiping to the Northeast Liberated Area on September 24th, said that the People's Liberation Army had shot down as many as 18 aircraft of the Kuomintang Air Force's 4th Group, 23rd Squadron in the past two years. He recently broadcast to the Kuomintang Air Force through Xinhua Broadcasting Station, saying that among the Kuomintang Air Force personnel captured by the People's Liberation Army that he was familiar with were Wan Kezhuang, Yang Enping, Cao Shipeng, Yang Zhifei, Guo Fenglin, and Zhu Anqi. Those who were hit by the People's Liberation Army during bombing and destroyed with their planes included He Jiayan, Zhang Guanying, He Tongcang, and Wu Qixian. Taking the 23rd Squadron of the 4th Group as an example, since fighting in the Northeast in 1946, it has replenished 37 aircraft, and 18 aircraft have been shot down by the People's Liberation Army in more than two years. These include numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 22, 25, 26, 29, 30, 32, and 34. Yang Peiguang said in his concluding remarks of the broadcast: "From the situation of our squadron described above, it can be seen very clearly that the Kuomintang Air Force has had many aircraft destroyed and many people captured by the People's Liberation Army in the past two years. Recently, the People's Liberation Army has achieved great victories, and there will be even greater victories in the future. Therefore, the fate of our air force can be imagined in the future. The number of those shot down, killed, and captured will inevitably increase greatly. Therefore, we should make plans early. Facts have proved that the path I took is correct."
    Also reported: Li Shixi, a captain and section chief of the 4th Group of the Kuomintang Air Force, who was shot down and captured near Tongliao on October 15th while flying a plane, is currently studying at the PLA Officers' Group in Harbin. On that day, he flew a P-51 fighter plane from Shenyang to reconnaissance between Zhengjiatun, Tongliao, and Zhangwu. He was hit by the People's Liberation Army over the Bahuta Railway Station south of Tongliao and was forced to land on a sandy land in Yangjiawopeng, southwest of Dongkehou Banner, where he was captured by local people. According to him, when the plane was hit and about to catch fire and forced to land, he felt extremely sad and hopeless. After the plane landed, his head was slightly injured. He quickly ran out of the fuselage and walked forward, dizzy. Before long, he met an old man working in the fields, who stopped him and asked him what he was doing. He replied, "I am a pilot and was shot down." Then many more people came, one of whom said to him, "Don't be afraid, we don't kill prisoners." So he was sent to the district office and then transferred to Harbin.

    保南与太原前线先后击落敌机两架
    【冀中前线一日电】十月二十八日，我军阻击由保定南犯之敌时，于保定西南二十五里之方顺桥，击落敌战斗机一架，机身焚毁，坠于保定西南之大固店附近。
    【本报讯】二日下午，美帝援蒋之Ｐ五十一式飞机一架，在太原前线被解放军地面部队击伤，坠于我华北解放区某地。少尉驾驶员王树容，已被俘获。机中装有机枪六挺，电台一部。该机号码为二二九四，隶属北平蒋匪空军第四大队二十二中队第一分队，系上月二十九日甫自沈阳撤至北平者。驾驶员王树容现年二十八岁，家居北平，原籍河北省永清县大麻子庄，他曾在美国陆军航空学校受训一年，一九四六年返国后，即被编入蒋匪空军第四大队，被国民党反动派用来进攻东北人民。
    【新华社东北三十一日电】国民党空军第四大队二十三分队两年来被解放军先后击落的飞机有十八架之多，这是九月二十四由北平驾Ｐ五一式飞机一架飞来东北解放区的国民党空军四大队二十三分队杨培光（前误为杨配光）上尉所说的。他日前经新华广播电台向国民党空军广播说，被解放军所俘获的国民党空军人员据他所熟悉的，就有万克庄、杨恩平、操式鹏、杨志飞、郭凤林、朱安淇等。轰炸时为解放军击中而人机俱毁的有何家彦、张冠英、何同苍、吴启先等。以四大队二十三分队来说，从一九四六年到东北作战以来，先后补充过三十七架飞机，两年多被解放军击落就有十八架。计为第一号、二号、三号、四号、十号、十二号、十四号、十五号、十六号，十七号、二十号、二十二号、二十五号、二十六号、二十九号、三十号、三十二号、三十四号。杨培光于广播结语中说：“由上述我们分队的情形，就可以看得很清楚，两年来国民党很多飞机被解放军击毁了，很多人被俘了。最近解放军获得了伟大的胜利，将来还有更大的胜利。所以我们空军的命运今后更可以想象到的。被击落、击毙、俘获的将必然大量增加。因此我们应早作打算。事实证明我走的路是对的。”
    又讯：十月十五日在通辽附近驾机被击落就俘的国民党空军第四大队上尉课长李式熹，刻已在哈尔滨解放军官团学习。他当日驾了一架Ｐ五一式战斗机由沈阳起飞，至郑家屯、通辽、彰武间侦察，在通辽南巴胡塔车站上空为解放军击中，被迫降落于东科后旗西南杨家窝棚沙丘地上，为当地人民俘获。据他说，当飞机中弹势将起火被迫降落时，他心中感到万分悲哀绝望。飞机着陆后他头部被碰伤了一点，他很快从机身中跑出来，晕头晕脑地向前走，没有多远，就碰到一位下地的老百姓，拦住了他，并且问他是作什么的。他回答说：“我是飞机驾驶员，被打下来的。”接着又来了许多人，其中的一个对他说：“你不要害怕，我们是不杀害俘虏的。”于是他就被送到区公所去，以后，又辗转送至哈尔滨。
