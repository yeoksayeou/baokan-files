Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. In the socialist competition to accelerate the completion of the post-war Five-Year Plan, the mass invention and production improvement movement launched by millions of engineers and workers in Soviet industry continues to achieve brilliant results. A recent remarkable example is the widespread application of a new method for high-speed metal cutting. Previously, the speed of cutting metal was 30 to 40 meters per minute. Through the efforts of workers, it was initially accelerated to 250 meters per minute, and later to 542 meters per minute. This year, Leningrad's Stakhanovite lathe workers Paulkevich and Bilykov, and machine worker Savich, further improved this new method. When manufacturing complex parts, they increased the speed of metal cutting to 1,000 meters per minute. This new method is now widely used throughout the country. TASS claims that this new method is a major revolution in technology. Izvestia wrote that if all Soviet factories apply this method, they can save 70 million work hours, more than 130 million rubles in wages, 300 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, and many machines annually. Including other benefits, the total annual savings will reach 700 million rubles. In addition, a group of machine manufacturing engineers recently invented a method for controlling automatic lathes using mathematical charts. When cutting machine parts, the automatic lathe can automatically adjust according to precise charts, preventing deviations and damage to manufactured goods. This new method can save a large number of calculators, several thousand tons of metal, and tens of millions of rubles annually.
    
    The number of creations, inventions, and suggestions similar to the above by Soviet workers and engineers is increasing daily. The number of suggestions they made last year increased by 26 percent compared to the previous year, with an average of 145 suggestions and inventions per thousand people. This number has continued to increase this year. In the first half of this year alone, the machine industry put forward 12,000 suggestions. Many valuable suggestions have been widely adopted and have greatly accelerated production and saved costs.
    
    The Presidium of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union made an important decision in August this year to encourage mass inventions and suggestions, suggesting that the trade union committees of various factories further systematically help inventors and suggestors by organizing seminars for them and providing books, laboratories, and workshops for their use. The Presidium of the Trade Union also suggested to various trade unions that they conduct public inspections in the fourth quarter of this year jointly with relevant government departments on the adoption of all inventions and suggestions in industry, in order to more widely adopt these inventions and suggestions and stimulate the development of mass creativity.

　　苏联工业中千百万工程师和工人
  　掀起群众性发明运动
    【新华社陕北十日电】在加紧完成战后五年计划的社会主义竞赛中，苏联工业中千百万工程师和工人所掀起的群众性的发明及改善生产方法的运动，不断获得光辉成果。最近一个卓越的例子是高速度切割金属的新方法已经广泛应用。以前切割金属的速度原为每分钟卅至四十公尺，经过工人的努力，最初加速到每分钟二百五十公尺，后来又加速到五百四十二公尺。今年列宁格勒的斯塔哈诺夫运动者旋盘工人包尔克维奇、比利柯夫、机器工人萨维奇，将这一新方法加以进一步的提高，他们在制造复杂的零件时，切割金属的速度增加到每分钟一千公尺。现在这一新方法已在全国广泛应用。塔斯社称：这一新方法是技术学上的一大革命。消息报著文称：苏联一切工厂应用这一方法，每年可节省七千万个工时、一亿三千万以上卢布的工资、三亿千瓦时的电力和许多机器，加上其他利益，每年节省总数将达七亿卢布。此外，最近又有一批机器制造工程师发明了一种用数学图表管制自动车床的办法。自动车床在切割机器零件时，能依照精确的图表自动调整，防止发生偏差毁坏制造品。这一新方法可以节省大量计算员，每年可以节省几千吨金属和几千万卢布。
    苏联工人与工程师类似上述的创造、发明与建议，日益增多。他们去年所提的建议比前年增加了百分之二十六，平均每一千人就提供了一百四十五件建议与发明。这个数字今年又继续增多。今年上半年，仅机器工业一项即提出了一万二千种建议。许多宝贵的建议已作广泛采用，并大大地加速了生产和节省了成本。
    苏联职工会中央委员会主席团在今年八月间作了鼓励群众性发明及建议的重要决定，建议各工厂的职工委员会进一步有系统地帮助发明者与建议者，为他们组织座谈，供给图书、实验室与工作间，任他们使用。职工会主席团并向各职工会建议，在今年第四季与政府各主管部门共同对一切发明与建议在工业中采用的情况进行公开检查，以便更广泛的采用这些发明与建议，并刺激群众创造性的发展。
