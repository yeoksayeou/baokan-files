　　The Tree Planting Association of Zhaolanzhuang, Jin County
　　Huang Shu
　　Zhaolanzhuang Village in the First District of Jin County has 526 households and a total of 11,450 mu of land, of which sandy land accounts for 40%. Before the July 7th Incident, there were four tree planting associations in the village, which planted peach, pear, willow and other trees to the northwest, southwest and west of the village. When the Japanese devils came, they dug up all the trees, leaving behind a large expanse of white sand. The wind and sand blew into the good land in the south of the village, greatly reducing the lives of the villagers.
　　After the village was liberated in 1943, Zheng Luoxi, who was enthusiastic about planting trees, consulted with four like-minded neighbors, pointing out that there was a lot of barren sandy land in the west of the village, which was suffering from sandstorms; if they planted trees together, they would benefit quickly and block the sand. Everyone agreed. That spring, the five families pooled money to buy tree saplings and contributed labor equally, planting one qing of willow poles. The wasteland of the five families was not enough, so they also planted some land belonging to others. It was stipulated that the land counted as half a share, and the tree saplings and labor counted as half a share. For the sake of easy calculation, the old, strong, and young were counted as the same share, regardless of the size of their labor.
　　This one qing of willow poles has been well protected every year, and seedlings are replanted when they are missing. Last year was the fifth year, and some poles and willow branches had already been harvested. This year's harvest of poles, in addition to expanding the planting by one qing, can also sell 7,000 roots, which can bring in more than 1 million Jichaobi. In addition, a large number of branches were harvested to supply the five households in the village for basket weaving.
　　Zheng Luoxi's tree planting association attracted the attention of the village, and everyone felt that his method was good and profitable. The second year, they were organized one after another. Now there are 17 tree planting associations in the village, large and small, with the smallest having three households and the largest having twenty-four households, all led by a chairman. Large tree planting associations are also divided into groups, led by a manager. Households participating in tree planting associations account for 60% of the total number of households in the village. Households that have not joined have also started planting trees. The trees in the village are well protected.
　　In the past six years, this village has afforested 16 qing of land, with willow poles and red osier each accounting for half, and fruit trees are also being developed. Forty percent of the sandy wasteland in the village has been eliminated, and the wind and sand are gradually being suppressed; the village's production and people's lives are gradually rising.

　　晋县赵兰庄的树会
    黄舒
    晋县一区赵兰庄全村五二六户，共有地一一四五○亩，沙地就占了四成。七七事变前，村里有四个树会，把村子西北、西南和西面都栽满了桃梨和杨柳树。日本鬼子来了，把树全刨走，留下一片大白沙。风沙一直刮到村南的好地里，老乡的生活大大的降低了。
    民国三十二年这村解放后，热心栽树的郑洛喜，找了四家合得来的地邻商量，指出村西的沙荒地很多，荒着刮沙尽遭害；如果伙着栽树，得利又快又挡沙，大家谁也赞成。这年春天，五家便摊款买树秧，平均出劳力，栽了一顷柳杆子。五家的荒地不够，又栽了别人一点地。规定：地算一半股，树秧和劳动力共算一半股。为了计算方便，老头、壮年和青年不分劳力大小，一样算股。
    这一顷柳杆子，年年都被保护的很好，缺了苗便补上。去年是第五年，已经收了一部分杆子和柳条。今年所收的杆子，除扩大多栽一顷以外，还能卖出七千根，可得冀钞一百多万元。另外，又收割了大量条子，供给本村五户编筐的使用。
    郑洛喜的树会，引起村里注意，大家都觉得他的办法好，得利多。第二年便陆陆续续的组织起来。现在全村共有十七个树会，大小不等，小的有三户，大的有二十四户，都有会长领导。大的树会还分小组，由管事领导。参加树会的户，占了全村户数的六成。没入会的户，也跟着栽起树来。村里的树木都保护的很好。
    六年来，这村已造林十六顷，柳杆和红荆各占一半，还正在发展果木树。全村里沙荒已经消灭了四成，风沙逐渐的被压制下去了；村里的生产和人们的生活正渐渐地在上升。
