　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, November 7th dispatch from Moscow: Since the October Revolution, Soviet collective farms and state farms have greatly increased the planting of protective forests, with a total area of 300,000 hectares, equivalent to thirteen times that of the Tsarist era before the revolution. The Soviet Union currently has a fairly extensive network of farms implementing "crop and pasture rotation systems" and has already obtained significant benefits, with yields increasing by 50 to 100 percent. For example, in the "Zaporozhye" collective farm in the Stalino Oblast of Ukraine, the wheat yield per hectare on land without protective forests was 21 centners, while the yield per hectare on land with protective forests increased to 40 centners (each centner equals 100 catties).
    Now, on the 31st anniversary of the October Revolution, collective farmers and agricultural workers in the Dnipro, Don, Volga, and Kuban river basins, Ukraine, the North Caucasus, Crimea, the Salsk Steppe, and Central Asia, which still sometimes suffer from drought, are intensifying afforestation efforts, and working to implement the plan formulated by the Party and the government to overcome drought and guarantee bumper harvests every year. Collective farms in various regions have now cultivated nearly 100,000 hectares of land in preparation for afforestation, and are cultivating various seedlings on tens of thousands of hectares of land.
    At the same time, under the leadership of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, scientists are working actively. Various experts from the Soil Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Forest Amelioration Institute, and the Department of Geological Soil Science of Moscow University have drafted specific instructions on afforestation and the implementation of crop and pasture rotation systems, and have designed various new types of machinery for afforestation, sowing tree seeds, pasture seeds, and building irrigation projects, which have been handed over to mechanical factories for mass production. Expedition teams organized by various experts are setting off to various regions to carry out work one after another, and experts have also gone to the largest afforestation area in the largest desert in Central Asia to guide afforestation work. Agricultural operators will also be sent to various collective farms. This winter, collective farmers will receive special training on afforestation and sowing pasture. The Ministry of Agriculture has decided to publish a large number of books and pictures to promote experience.

### 苏联集体农民和科学家　实施战胜旱灾计划加紧进行造林工作

　　苏联集体农民和科学家
  　实施战胜旱灾计划加紧进行造林工作
    【新华社陕北七日电】莫斯科讯：自十月革命以来，苏联集体农场和国家农场大量增植防护森林，总面积已达三十万公顷，相当于革命前帝俄时代的十三倍。苏联目前已有一部分颇为广大的、实行“农作物与牧草轮种制”的农场网，并已获得显著的利益，收获量增加了百分之五十至一百。例如乌克兰斯大林诺州的“萨波罗什”集体农场，未种防护森林的田地每公顷产小麦二十一生丁纳，而种了防护森林的田地每公顷产量则增加到四十生丁纳（每生丁纳合一百市斤）。
    现在，当十月革命三十一周年之际，德聂伯河、顿河、伏尔加河、库班河流域、乌克兰、北高加索、克里米亚、萨尔克斯草原及中亚细亚有时还遭受旱灾之苦的集体农民和农业工人，都加紧造林，着手实现党和政府所制订的战胜旱灾保证年年丰收的计划。各地集体农场现已耕种了近十万公顷的土地准备造林，并以成万公顷的土地栽培各种树苗。
    同时，在苏联农业部的领导下，科学家们正积极工作。苏联科学院土壤研究所、森林改良研究所、莫斯科大学地质土壤系的各种专家们，草拟了关于造林及实行农作物与牧草轮种制的具体指示，并设计了用于造林、播种树木种子牧草种子及建设灌溉工程的各种新型机械，交给机械工厂大批制造。各种专家组织的远征队，正陆续出发到各个地区去进行工作，中亚细亚最大沙漠的大造林区也已有专家们去指导造林工作。农业经营家们也将被派到各集体农场去。今冬集体农民们将受到关于造林和播种牧草的特别训练。农业部已决定出版大量的书册和图片，以推广经验。
