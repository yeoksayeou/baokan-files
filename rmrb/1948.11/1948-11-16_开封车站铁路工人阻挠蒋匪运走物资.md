Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 12th: Before the liberation of Kaifeng, just as the Kuomintang bandit troops were in a state of panic and fleeing towards Xuzhou, the Kuomintang Railway Administration in Kaifeng issued a work stoppage order to the Longhai Railway workers, and demanded that the workers register according to one of the following three options: (1) Retreat to Xuzhou with the Kuomintang army. (2) Disperse locally. (3) Remain on duty at the factory. They also deceived the workers by saying, "The Eighth Route Army kills anyone wearing a uniform," and "If you go to Xuzhou, you'll have work and rice to eat," and so on. The results of the registration greatly disappointed the Kuomintang officials. Of the seven or eight hundred workers, except for a very few, all wrote their names under the "Remain on duty at the factory" option.

　　On the afternoon of October 22nd, the People's Liberation Army gradually approached the city of Kaifeng. The Kuomintang army, in a panic, fully loaded over forty train cars with military uniforms, bullets, vehicles, grain, and other supplies, and the train was just waiting to depart. At this time, the driver Zhang Mingzhen feigned illness and hid. Other workers also dispersed. The railway section chief, Fu Guoxiang, jumped from car to car, unable to find anyone to drive the train. Before long, more than one hundred workers gathered from all directions to ask Fu for severance pay. Some sat on the tracks, while others negotiated with Fu. In short, they would not let the train leave. Fu deceived them, saying, "As long as the train reaches Shangqiu, I will definitely send the money back," while also anxiously saying, "You guys hurry up and drive the train!" But the workers continued to pester him...

　　When the People's Liberation Army rushed to the station, the over forty train cars, fully loaded with supplies, were still parked there. The workers welcomed the People's Liberation Army, recounting the story of these forty-plus train cars, and laughing, "To hell with them... We don't even want the money now."

　　开封车站铁路工人阻挠蒋匪运走物资
    【新华社开封十二日电】开封光复前，正当国民党匪军兵慌马乱向徐州逃命的时候，开封国民党铁路管理处给陇海铁路工人下了停工的命令，并且要工人照以下三条中选择一条进行登记：（一）随着国民党军退往徐州。（二）就地疏散。（三）在厂留守。他们还欺骗工人说：“八路来了见穿制服的人就杀”。“到徐州去有工做，有大米吃”等等。登记结果国民党官员们大失所望。七八百工人中，除极少数外，都在“在厂留守”项下写上了自己的名字。
    十月二十二日下午，解放军渐渐逼近开封城。国民党军惶恐地把军装、子弹、汽车、粮食等，满满的装了四十多节车厢，火车只等着开动了。这时，司机张明振装病躲开了。其他工人也走散了。铁路段长傅国祥从这车跳到那车，找不着一个人开车。不一会，有一百多工人自四处集拢来向傅要遣散费，他们有的坐在铁轨上，有的和傅办交涉。总之，不让火车开走。傅一边欺骗说：“只要火车到了商邱，我一定把钱寄来。”一边又着急地说：“你们快开车吧！”但工人却始终把他纠缠着。………
    当解放军冲到车站时，满装物资的四十多节车厢，依然停在那里。工人们迎着解放军，讲述着这四十多节车厢的故事，笑着说：“去他们的吧………现在咱也不要钱了。”
