　　To Comrade Ma Lin of the Changzhi Agricultural and Forestry Bureau:
    Your suggestions regarding the planting of Golden Queen corn, along with the investigated materials, have been forwarded to the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government for research.
    To the Service Group of the Ji-Lu-Yu Newspaper:
    Regarding the seven rubber-wheeled carts and nineteen head of livestock borrowed from the masses of the First District of Changyuan by the troops last winter when fighting in Changyuan, which have not yet been returned, we have forwarded the matter to the North China Military Region for investigation.
    To Ms. Li Xiulan of Wuxiang:
    After you joined the revolutionary work and got married, your family should enjoy the treatment of revolutionary family members (but cannot enjoy it in both places). If the village cadres do not recognize this due to lack of understanding, you can ask the district and county government to write a letter of certification to resolve the matter.
    To Mr. Li Fuchang of the North China Military Region:
    Regarding your reflection that Pang Su, a teacher at the Nan Town Village Elementary School in the Sixth District of Quyang, has been absent from school and not teaching for a long time, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses, we have forwarded this situation to the Quyang Education Section to let them inspect and correct it.
    To Mr. Kang Xi of Xiguan, Xingtang:
    The agricultural tax regulations once stipulated that the tax exemption point for poor and labor-free military dependents and widowers/widows should be appropriately raised by two to five *shi* (市) *dou* (斗). If your family meets the above conditions, the amount of deduction can be decided through mass discussion.
