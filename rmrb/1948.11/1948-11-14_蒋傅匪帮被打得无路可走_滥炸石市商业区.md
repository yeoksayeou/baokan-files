　　Jiang-Fu Bandit Gang Driven to Dead End
  　Indiscriminate Bombing of Shijiazhuang Commercial District
    [This Newspaper] The Jiang-Fu bandit gang's conspiracy to raid Shijiazhuang has been completely crushed. Like a mad dog being beaten and chased to a dead end by people, it still jumps up to bite before dying. At 3:00 PM on the 5th, two American-made B-24 heavy bombers indiscriminately bombed the commercial district of Shijiazhuang, dropping 22 heavy bombs, killing and wounding 34 innocent merchants, civilians, and their families (most of whom were women and children), and destroying more than 80 shops, factories, and civilian houses. After the enemy planes dropped their bombs, the reporter immediately rushed to the disaster area to inspect and witnessed the security and protection corps rescuing the wounded and searching for the bodies of the compatriots who had been killed, responsibly and busily. The district and street governments also rushed to comfort the disaster-stricken people.

　　蒋傅匪帮被打得无路可走
  　滥炸石市商业区
    【本报讯】蒋傅匪帮偷袭石家庄的阴谋完全被粉碎了。象被人们赶打得无路可走的疯狗一样，临死还要跳起来咬人一口。五日下午三时，以美造Ｂ２４式重轰炸机两架滥炸石市商业区，投重磅炸弹二十二枚，死伤无辜商民及其家属三十四人（其中大部分是妇孺），毁商店、工厂、民房八十余间。记者在敌机投弹后即赶赴被灾区域视察，目睹治安防护团在救护伤者，寻觅被难同胞的尸体，负责而忙碌。区街政府亦赶往安抚灾胞。
