Xinhua News Agency, North China, 10th. Due to the correct policies implemented by the democratic governments in the liberated areas towards refugees and enemy personnel, the number of refugees returning to the Taihang border areas and enemy military and political personnel coming over to surrender is increasing daily. The Taihang District Party Committee has therefore stipulated specific handling measures, the main points of which are as follows:

　　(1) Landlords and rich peasants who fled to enemy areas and return shall be resettled appropriately, but they must be ordered to formally register with the district and village governments, acknowledge their past mistakes, guarantee to abide by the law in the future, and sever private contacts with the enemy areas. If they disobey government orders after returning, or spread rumors and cause trouble, disrupting social order, they must be dealt with according to law and must not be allowed to do as they please.

　　(2) Village cadres and militiamen who compromised with the enemy out of fear and fled to enemy areas must be ordered to register with the district and village governments, admit their mistakes, and be given the same treatment as other farmers in terms of economy. Those who returned after defecting to the enemy shall be given due punishment according to the severity of their circumstances. Such personnel shall not be allowed to serve as militiamen or cadres again.

　　(3) Enemy military and political personnel who surrender to us and enemy personnel captured by us shall be handed over to the political department of the military sub-district for handling. Leading organs of counties and districts, as well as militia district cadre teams, work teams, etc., shall not handle them on their own.

　　敌军政人员来归者日众
  　太行订出具体处理办法
    【新华社华北十日电】由于解放区民主政府对于逃亡户与敌方人员执行了正确的政治，太行边沿地区逃亡户回来者及敌方军政人员前来投诚者日渐增多。太行区党委为此规定具体处理办法，其要点如下：
    （一）逃亡敌区之地主富农回来者一律酌情予以安置，但必须令其向区村政府正式登记，承认过去错误，保证今后奉公守法，断绝与敌区之私自来往。如回来后不服从政府命令，或造谣生事，破坏社会治安者，必须依法处置，不得放任。
    （二）因惧怕敌人，与敌妥协，逃往敌区之村干部民兵回来者，必须令其向区村政府登记，承认错误、经济上给与和其他农民同等待遇。若系投敌回来者，应按其情节轻重，予以应得的处分，此项人员，一律不得再当民兵或干部。
    （三）向我投诚之敌军政人员及被我捕捉之敌方人员，一律交分区政治部处理，县区领导机关及民兵区干队武工队等不得自行处理。
