Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhou, 29th: The headquarters of the People's Liberation Army Northeast Field Army has now released Zhang Zuoxiang, who was captured in the Jinzhou campaign. Zhang Zuoxiang, the current advisor to the Kuomintang government and deputy director of the Northeast "Suppression General" Political Affairs Committee, was captured in Jinzhou city on the 15th. When our soldiers found him in a cellar, he obediently immediately asked someone to take out ten short guns from the floorboards and hand them over. He was the most neatly dressed among the enemy prisoners in Jinzhou, with a round face, wearing a woolen overcoat, a top hat, and carrying a cane. This old soldier, who is nearly seventy years old, was brought out by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits as a so-called "Northeast Elder" to "maintain the hearts of the people in the Northeast" when the Chiang bandits' regime in the Northeast was on the verge of collapse. When General Lin Biao summoned him on the 21st, he滔滔不绝 (tao tao bu jue, talked on and on without stopping) about his "difficulties." He said with infinite desolation, "More than twenty years, it's a long story." Then he repeatedly explained that Chiang Kai-shek gave him the title of "Deputy Director," and there was really no other way. He said that seventy members of his family lived in Tianjin, and the situation was difficult. He came to Jinzhou because he had some fields here to maintain his family's life. He also recounted, "A trip to Nanjing cost over a hundred thousand. This time, flying to Shenyang cost more than two billion in circulating currency. In Shenyang, it was difficult to advance or retreat, and there was nothing I could do. Back in Jinzhou, I even cooked my own meals for more than forty days." He said, "Those who follow Chiang Kai-shek, not to mention the old ones, even the young ones are like this. The Northeast Army, following Chiang Kai-shek, is finished. Wang Tiehan, Zhou Fucheng, and Huo Shouyi's troops rolled around and only a little bit was left. Wang Tiehan became a bachelor after returning to the Northeast. Huo Shouyi was captured in Shandong long ago." General Lin Biao mildly instructed him: "Old people should preserve some reputation. Among the people of the Northeast, people like Mo Dehui and Ma Zhanshan; following Chiang Kai-shek, shouting and screaming, opposing communism and opposing the people, on the one hand, they are being used, greedy for high positions and generous salaries, and on the other hand, they cannot see the rights and wrongs, advantages and disadvantages. If they continue to be reactionary, they will surely reap the consequences. Today, Chiang Kai-shek's collapse is inevitable. People who understand the truth should do things beneficial to the people, and at the very least, not assist villains in doing evil. Otherwise, it is unjust and unwise, and it is not good for the country, the people, or oneself. Even those who have done bad things in the past, as long as they have not reached the point of being hated by the broad masses of the people and can turn over a new leaf and stop doing bad things, the people may give them leniency." Zhang Zuoxiang repeatedly said "yes" after hearing this. Speaking of American imperialism's aid to Chiang, he said, "It won't work no matter how much aid the United States provides; you still have to win the hearts of the people. Deviating from the hearts of the people will inevitably lead to failure." When answering General Lin Biao's advice of "don't be fooled again," he repeatedly said, "Commander can rest assured about this, I won't be fooled again. It doesn't matter whether I am an official of Chiang Kai-shek, I am almost seventy years old, what else can I do." Finally, General Lin Biao told him that he was preparing to send someone to protect him out of the country and send him back to Tianjin. Zhang Zuoxiang said gratefully, "Thank you very much for the Commander's kindness. I will do whatever the Commander instructs. Personally speaking, I would like to stay in the liberated area and do not want to go back, only because my family is in Tianjin and there is no one to take care of them. After I go back, I still want to settle my family in Jinzhou, and I will have to ask you to worry about it." General Lin Biao replied to him: "You can come back to Jinzhou. The democratic government will handle your family's property reasonably and according to law." At the end of the conversation, Zhang Zuoxiang took his leave.

    我释放张作相
    林彪将军晓谕他以后不要反人民
    【新华社锦州二十九日电】人民解放军东北野战军司令部，现已释放在锦州战役中被俘之张作相。现任国民党政府顾问及东北剿总政务委员会副主任委员张作相，是十五日在锦州城内被俘的。当我军战士从地窖中将他搜出时，他很顺从地马上叫人从楼板上取出十支短枪交上。他是锦州敌俘中穿戴顶整齐的一个，团团面孔，身着呢大衣，头戴着礼帽，手扶手杖。这个年纪已近七十的旧军人，当东北的蒋匪天下摇摇欲坠之时，以所谓“东北元老”的身份，被蒋匪找出来“维系东北人心”。当林彪将军二十一日传见他时，滔滔不绝地诉述着“苦衷”。他无限凄凉地说：“廿余年，一言难尽”。接着反复解释，蒋介石给他一个“副主任委员”的名义，实在是没有办法。家里有七十多口人住在天津，境况为难。住到锦州来，是因为这里有些田业，借以维持家庭生活。又诉述“去南京一趟，化了十几万。这次飞沈阳，又化了流通券二十多亿。在沈阳进退两难，无可如何。回到锦州，还自己作了四十多天的饭。”他说：“跟随蒋介石的人不要说老的，就是年青的也是如此。东北军跟着蒋介石的，都光了。王铁汉，周福成，霍守义的部队滚来滚去，都只剩得一点点。王铁汉回东北后，变成了一个光棍。霍守义则在山东早就被俘了”。林彪将军温和地晓谕他：“上了年纪的人要留些名誉，东北人中象莫德惠，马占山之流；追随蒋介石大喊大叫，反共反人民，一方面是被人利用，贪图高官厚禄，一方面也是由于看不清楚是非利害。假若他们继续反动，必将自食其果。今天蒋介石塌台的局面，已经定了。明白事理的人要做些有益于人民的事情，最低限度也不要助杰为虐。否则，便是不义与不智，对国家，对人民，对自己，都没有好处。就是从前做过坏事的人，只要他们尚未弄到为广大人民群众所切齿痛恨的程度，并能幡然改图，停止做坏事，则人民就可能给以宽大”。张作相听了这一席话，连连称是。谈到美帝国主义援蒋，他说：“美国援助再多也不行，总得要得民心，背离民心就必然要失败的。他答复林彪将军所劝告的‘不要再去上当’时，诺诺连声的说：‘这一点，司令可以放心，再也上不了当。蒋介石的官当不当没有什么，我快七十岁了，还能做什么事情。”最后，林彪将军告诉他准备派人保护他出境，送他回天津。张作相感激地说：“多承司令的厚谊，司令怎样吩咐就怎样。拿我个人来说，倒是愿意留在解放区，不想回去，只因家在天津，无人照料，我回去后还是想把家里安顿到锦州来，还要请多费心。”林彪将军答复他：“你可回到锦州来。你家里的财产，民主政府将依法合理办理”。谈话结束，张作相乃告辞退。
