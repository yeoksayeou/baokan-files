　　To Zhong Huijun, First District, Xingtang:
    It is good that the masses in your village of Kou Touzhen have formed a drama troupe and are engaging in cultural entertainment after the liberation. However, the situation you describe: hiring specialists to teach opera, extravagant waste, affecting production, affecting primary school education, and drawing upon the fruits of the masses' struggle, collecting grain from the masses, this is not what the masses want, absolutely not acceptable. The county and district leaders should correct this and check whether other areas have this phenomenon.

    To Wang Youxin, Fourth District, Wutai, Beijian Village:
    Your bicycle was borrowed by cadre Zhang Huanming and has not been returned to this day, nor is its whereabouts known. We have forwarded your letter to the Wutai County Committee. You can go there in person to inquire.

    To Chen Dengke, Sixth District, Wutai, Weiwan Village:
    Regarding the land dispute between Weiwan Village in the Sixth District and Gengjia Zhuang in the Third District, the description in your letter is not detailed enough to provide a response. Please ask the Third District Public Office to resolve the matter reasonably through consultation based on the specific circumstances.

    To Taiyue Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory and Yu Xiangjun:
    Regarding the issue that many villages do not recognize the revolutionary soldier status for the cadres working at your factory in Changzhi and Huo counties, please ask your direct superior authority to write an official letter of certification, and then go to negotiate, which should resolve the matter.

    To Yao Ping Village, Fifth District, Xingtai City:
    Regarding the matter that the farmers' association in your village confiscated a landlord's house in Xingtai City during the land reform, and then the city government confiscated it again, we do not understand the reason why the city government confiscated it, whether there are other circumstances involved? Therefore, we have forwarded the letter to the Xingtai City Government for inquiry, awaiting a reply.

    To Wang Jingxiang, West Bank Village, Second District, Jianping:
    Regarding the issue that you are three brothers who bought nine mu and four fen of land through hard work as hired laborers, and then were allocated two mu and one fen of land from the landlord. Your family of five, during the land reform last year, took out the two mu of land allocated to you, and even the two mu of land you originally bought, for equal distribution. Because the letter did not explain the reason and process, we cannot give a specific answer. We have informed the Jianping Second District and requested the district government to investigate and handle the matter.

　　信箱行唐一区忠惠君：
    你村口头镇，群众于翻身后成立剧团，开展文化娱乐是很好的。但是象你所说的情况：请专人教戏，铺张浪费，影响生产，影响小学教育，并抽动群众斗争果实，向群众征集粮款，这不是群众的要求，万万要不得的，县区领导方面，应予纠正，并检查其他地区是否有此现象。五台四区北涧村王有信君：
    你的自行车被干部张焕明借去，至今未还，亦无下落。我们已将来信转五台县委会，你可亲自前往查询。五台六区维湾村陈登科君：
    六区维湾与三区耿家庄的土地纠纷事件，来信叙述不详，无法作复，可请三区区公所，根据具体情况，协商合理解决。太岳新华药厂和毓祥君：
    长治、霍县对你厂工作干部仍以革命军人待遇问题，很多村不予承认，可请你们直属上级机关正式写信证明，再前往交涉当可解决。邢台市五区姚平村：
    土改中你村农会在邢台市没收你村地主房子一处，后又被市府没收之事，我们不明白市府没收原因，是否其中还有其他情节？故将来信已转邢台市府询问，候复。建屏二区西岸村王景祥君：
    你兄弟三人，靠当长工短工省吃俭用，买了九亩四分地，后又分了地主的二亩一分地，全家五口人，在去年土改时将你分的二亩地，连你原先买的二亩地也拿出平分问题，因来信未说明原因和经过，不能具体作答，我们已将来函转告建屏二区请区政府调查处理。
