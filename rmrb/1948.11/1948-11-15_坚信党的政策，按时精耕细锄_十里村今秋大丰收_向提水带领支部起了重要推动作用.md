[Taihang News] The people of Ten-Li Village in Huguan County, due to their firm belief in the Party's policies, active response to the Party's call, timely cultivation, meticulous farming, and increased fertilization throughout the year's production movement, have achieved a great bumper harvest this autumn. The village has a total of more than 1,720 mu of land, with an expected yield of 2,425 shi, 9 dou, and 6 sheng. The actual harvest was 3,197 shi, 2 dou, and 5 sheng (including wheat land), exceeding the expected yield by more than 770 shi. Because the mutual aid farming organization was well-managed, nine households exceeded their expected yield. All eleven military dependents' households in the village, which lacked labor and livestock, also enjoyed abundant harvests of grain, with every household having rice and wheat in their granaries. Half of the villagers had surplus grain. On the 19th of this month, the villagers summarized by team, unanimously acknowledging that the reason for this year's bumper harvest was mainly due to the heroic and exemplary leadership and promotion by labor hero Comrade Xiang Tishui (branch secretary) and all party members and cadres, who closely integrated with the masses and worked together. In particular, the constant explanation of the Party's policies and the removal of the masses' ideological concerns ensured that production work was not hindered and could develop smoothly, which was one of the main reasons for this year's bumper harvest. They recalled that during the democratic party rectification in the spring, everyone's thinking was once confused. Party members were "undergoing trials," poor and hired peasants (including new middle peasants) were dividing equally, and middle peasants were fearing struggle (afraid of being struggled against). Seeing that the Qingming festival had passed, and the "Grain Rain" and "Mangzhong" seasons were approaching, but very few people were seen working in the fields. At this time, Comrade Xiang Tishui and others went separately to persuade the masses. They explained to the poor and hired peasants that they should not just wait for equal distribution and forget about production; to turn over and divide the land, they still had to rely on their own hard work. They explained to the middle peasants that the Communist Party is the party of the broad working people, protecting the interests of the working people, and that as long as something is earned through one's own labor, it will never be struggled against. They proposed to party members and cadres that actively leading the masses in production is the basic direction, that party rectification is to correct shortcomings, and that whatever should be done should still be done. This stabilized everyone's emotions, and production in the village began to become active. Comrade Xiang Tishui took the lead in actively working in the fields, influencing the masses with his practical actions and promoting the completion of sowing throughout the village. During the period of transplanting seedlings, summer weeding, and applying topdressing fertilizer, it was discovered that a few people were engaging in extreme democracy, and some cadres were acting as "good old men," relaxing their leadership, and the application of topdressing fertilizer and weeding could not be well implemented. To this end, Comrade Tishui convened a branch meeting to carry out ideological mobilization, making party members and cadres clearly understand that there would be difficulties in doing work, that some people would not be willing to do it, and that we should patiently carry out persuasion and education; it is wrong to give up leadership because of fear of difficulties. At the same time, he carried out correct democratic education among the masses. The masses' thinking gradually returned to normal, and the topdressing and weeding movement was carried out enthusiastically. The more than 1,400 mu of autumn crops in the village were generally hoed twice, and half reached three times. An average of 18 dan of topdressing fertilizer was applied per mu, for a total of 80 dan including base fertilizer. The results of this movement laid a solid foundation for this year's bumper harvest. Xiang Tishui applied 400 dan of base fertilizer to his 4.2 mu of flat land in the spring, and another 400 dan of topdressing fertilizer in the summer; he applied 170 dan of pen manure and 25 dan of night soil to his 7.7 mu of mountain land; he had more than 14 mu of land in total, with an average of 130 dan of fertilizer applied per mu. He hoed three times overall. This autumn, he harvested 32 shi and 3 dou of grain, exceeding the expected yield by more than 13 shi and 8 dou. Xiang Laixing, a newly liberated middle peasant, continued to hoe his seedlings every day during the summer drought when others had stopped. He said to others: "The county committee calls for an increase of 3 sheng of grain per mu; I must achieve that!" His land was hoed three times, and an average of 100 dan of fertilizer was applied per mu. This autumn, he harvested 5 shi and 4 dou from 1.6 mu of paddy field. He happily said to others: "Chairman Mao called on us to turn over and obtain land. Tishui educated me to work hard and harvest more grain. I really benefited a lot this year!" Military dependent Xiang Shengzhen only had one female laborer at home, but because she worked actively, she did her work on time every season. The corn was hoed three times, the millet was hoed twice, and 80 dan of fertilizer was applied per mu. Her 7.9 mu of land yielded more grain than expected, by 1 shi and 2 dou. Rich peasant Xiang Yingquan worked actively after the end of the land reform, and his 14 mu of land yielded more grain than expected, by 2 shi and 4 dou. However, there were also a few individuals who did not believe in the Party's policies and did not work actively, and they harvested less grain. Xiang Shuze always relied on turning over to divide the fruits and did not work. He planted good land, but applied less than 10 dan of fertilizer per mu. As a result, his six mu of paddy field only yielded 2 shi and 8 dou of grain. Middle peasant Xiang Ruzhang also planted good land near his home, but was afraid of struggle and did not actively produce, so his 2.5 mu of paddy field yielded 2 shi and 5 dou, not reaching the expected grain yield. These practical examples vividly educated those who did not believe in the Party's policies and did not work actively. Xiang Shuze regretfully said to people: "I didn't work hard all year, and I suffered a big loss in the autumn. No matter how much fertilizer I apply now, I won't be able to catch up this year!" Now he is rushing to plow autumn land and carry corn stalks, preparing to participate in mining in the mine kiln to make up for the poor harvest, and preparing to collect a circle of sheep manure to apply more fertilizer next year and work hard in production. Now the villagers are all involved in the movement to plow land and accumulate fertilizer, preparing for the development of a larger production movement next year. (Zhao Jingguo, Gui Suo)

　　坚信党的政策，按时精耕细锄
  　十里村今秋大丰收
    向提水带领支部起了重要推动作用
    【太行讯】壶关十里村群众，在全年生产运动中由于坚信党的政策，积极响应党的号召，按时耕作，精耕细锄，多上肥料，使今年秋禾大大丰收。全村共土地一千七百二十余亩，应产量二千四百二十五石九斗六升，实收粮三千一百九十七石二斗五升（包括麦地在内），超过应产量七百七十余石；因代耕组织得好，有九户超过应产量。全村十一户缺乏劳畜力的军干属，也家家五谷丰登，户户米麦成仓，二分之一的群众有了余粮。本月十九日，全村群众分队进行总结，一致承认：今年丰收的原因，主要是由于劳动英雄向提水（支书）同志及全体党员干部英雄模范的积极带头领导与推动，和群众紧紧结合在一起，共同努力的成果。特别是随时解说党的政策，扫除群众思想顾虑，使生产工作没有受到阻碍，得以顺利发展，更是今年丰收的主要原因之一。他们回忆春天民主整党时，大家思想曾一度混乱，党员等“过关”，贫雇（包括新中农）等平分，中农等斗争（怕斗）。眼看清明已过，“谷雨”“芒种”季节将到，但地里却很少见到有人做活。这时，向提水等同志便分头说服群众。向贫雇解释，不要光等平分，忘了生产，翻身分上土地，还得靠自己好好劳动。向中农说明：共产党是广大劳动人民的党，是保护劳动人民利益的，只要是自己劳动得来的东西，绝不会斗争。向党员干部提出：积极带领群众进行生产是基本方向，整党是为了改正毛病，该搞什么还应搞什么。这样才稳定了大家的情绪，全村生产开始活跃起来。向提水同志首先上地积极劳动，以实际行动影响群众，推动全村完成下种。到拔苗、夏锄、上追肥时期，又发现有几个人闹极端民主，部分干部当老好人，放松领导，追肥锄苗不能很好贯彻，提水同志为此一面召开支部会议，进行思想动员，使党员干部明确认识：做工作就会有困难，有人不愿干，我们应耐心进行说服教育，怕困难放弃领导是不对的。一面在群众中普遍进行正确的民主教育。群众思想渐复正常，追锄运动才热烈开展起来。全村一千四百余亩秋禾，普遍锄耨二次，二分之一达到三次。每亩平均上追肥一十八担，连底肥共上到八十担。这一运动的成绩，打下了今年丰收的坚实基础。向提水四亩二分平地，春天上底肥四百担，夏季又上追肥四百担；七亩七分山地，上了圈肥一百七十担，圊肥二十五担；他共有十四亩多地，每亩平均上肥一百三十担。普遍锄耨了三次。今秋打粮三十二石三斗，超过应产量十三石八斗多。向来兴是一个新翻身的中农，夏季天旱时，别人都停止了锄苗。他每天扛着锄到地里锄，并向别人说：“县委号召每亩增产三升粮，我非达到不可！”他的土地都锄够了三次，每亩平均上肥一百担，今秋一亩六分谷地，即打了五石四斗。他高兴的对别人说：“毛主席叫咱翻身，得到了土地，提水教育我好好劳动，多打了粮食，今年我真沾光不少！”军属向生珍，家里只有一个女劳力，但因积极劳动，每季都按时做好生活，玉茭锄了三次，谷子锄了两次，每亩上肥八十担，七亩九分地多打粮食一石二斗。富农向应全，结束土改后积极劳动，十四亩地多打粮食二石四斗。但也有个别人，由于不相信党的政策，不积极劳动，都少打了粮食，向书则一向依赖翻身分果实，不劳动，种的都是好地，每亩上不到十担肥，结果六亩多谷地只打粮二石八斗。中农向如章，种的也是近地好地，但怕斗争，不积极生产，二亩五分谷打了二石五斗，达不到应产粮数。这些实际例子，活生生的教育了不相信党的政策、不积极劳动的人。向书则后悔的对人说：“一年里自己不好好劳动，秋天吃了大亏，这就再上多少肥，今年也赶不上了！”现在他正赶忙＠秋地、担玉茭秆，准备到矿窑参加打矿补歉收，并准备踩一圈羊粪，明年多上肥，好好闹生产。现全村群众都卷入了＠地积肥运动，为开展明年更大的生产运动作好一切准备。（赵靖国、贵锁）
