　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Reports from various sources indicate that the American and British occupation zone governors in West Germany signed an agreement on the 9th of this month, announcing the return of the Ruhr industrial region to Nazi monopoly capitalists. This is yet another illegal action by American imperialism, violating the four-power decision to jointly handle the German question, and refusing to hand over this German heavy industry center to international joint management with Soviet participation. The revival of German aggression forces will directly threaten the security of France. After the announcement of this agreement, it immediately aroused widespread opposition from the French people. Under the pressure of the people, and also because their own interests were disregarded, the Queuille government had to formally protest the signing of this agreement to the American and British governments, declaring that the French government did not recognize this agreement. Vyshinsky, the head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, gave a speech to the Political Committee of the General Assembly on the 13th, condemning the world's reactionaries for systematically preparing for a new war. Vyshinsky pointed out that while the French representatives were violating the four-power agreements on Germany and Berlin together with the American and British representatives, the American and British governments finalized an agreement to return the Ruhr to German capitalists who had collaborated with Hitler. This is a fact that stirs the entire French nation, but it is also the punishment for France helping the American and British governments violate international agreements.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: TASS Moscow, 21st: Pravda's international observer wrote, in discussing the event of the American and British governments returning the Ruhr to Nazi monopoly capitalists, that the United States and Britain had taken a new divisive action in their policy aimed at restoring the rule of West German monopoly capital. The authorities of the American and British joint occupation zones issued a decree on the 10th of this month, announcing the so-called "dissolution" of the former German Konzerns. However, the assets of the old Konzerns were handed over to new Konzerns, and the shareholders retained their past rights unchanged. Thus, the so-called "reorganization" was merely a change of signboard. Another similar monopoly organization has also been established in the steel industry. In this way, the road has been paved for Wall Street and the Ruhr tycoons to cooperate further. The American and British ruling groups presented a fait accompli to France, Belgium and Luxembourg. The French government, in an extremely difficult situation, issued a protest to the American and British authorities against the decree of the 10th of this month in order to "save face." French Foreign Minister Schuman told the American and British ambassadors that this decree "violates the French view that the final decision on the question of who should own the Ruhr assets must be made by the relevant Allied countries through negotiation." However, restoring the rights of the former Ruhr tycoons is the logical conclusion of subordinating French interests to the interests of the dollar. This meeting is the most recent illegal meeting convened in violation of the Allied agreements on the German question. Needless to say, the decisions of this meeting, like other unilateral actions of the Western occupation countries, have no legal force. The course of events clearly proves that the interests of world peace and the security of all countries require the establishment of four-power joint control over the Ruhr industrial area, as agreed upon by the Allied countries.

　　英美违背四强共同处置德国问题原则
  　竟把鲁尔交还纳粹大亨
    真理报谴责美英反动派非法分裂行动
    【新华社陕北廿三日电】各方报导：西德美英两国占领军总督于本月九日签立协定，宣布将鲁尔工业交还纳粹独占资本家。这是美帝国主义再一次违背四强共同处置德国问题决定，拒绝把这一德国重工业中心交给有苏联参加的国际共管的非法行动。由于德国侵略势力的复活，将直接威胁到法国的安全，在该项协定宣布以后，立即引起了法国人民的普遍反对。法国反动派在人民压力之下，同时，也由于他们自身利益遭到了忽视，葛义政府不能不向美英政府正式抗议这一协定的签订，宣布法国政府不承认这一协定。苏联出席联合国大会代表团团长维辛斯基，十三日在联大政治委员会上演说，谴责世界反动派在有系统地准备新战争。维辛斯基指出：正当法国代表在与美英代表一道违反四强对德国与柏林问题协议的时候，美英两国却在法国最后签订了将鲁尔交还曾与希特勒合作的德国资本家的协定。这是一个激动全法国的事实，但这也正是对法国帮同美英两国违反国际协定的惩罚。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：真理报国际观察家在论及美英政府以鲁尔交还纳粹独占资本家的事件时写道，美英在以恢复西德独占资本统治为目标的政策上，又作了一次新的分裂行动。美英联合占领区当局本月十日颁布法令，宣布所谓“解散”以前的德国康采仑。但是，老康采仑的资产却交给了新的康采仑，而股东们则仍然保持其过去的权利不变。这样，所谓“改组”就只是换了换招牌。钢铁业也建立起另一个同样的独占组织。这样，就给华尔街与鲁尔大亨们铺平了更进一步合作的道路。美英统治集团将既成事实摆在法国与荷比卢面前。陷于极度困难境地的法国政府，为“保留脸面”起见向美英当局发出了对本月十日法令的抗议。法外长舒曼告美英大使说，这一法令“违背了法国的观点，法国的观点是鲁尔资产应归谁属的问题，其最后决定，必须由有关诸盟国协议制订”。但是，恢复前鲁尔大亨们的权利，是把法国利益从属于美元利益的逻辑的结论。这个会议是违反盟国间关于德国问题的协议而召集的最近一次的非法会议。不用说，这一会议的决定，也正象其他西部占领国家的单独行动一样，是没有合法力量的。事变的进程十分清楚地证明，世界和平以及各国安全的利益，要求按照盟国间所协议的那样，建立对鲁尔工业区的四强共管。
