Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th -- Under the shock of the People's Liberation Army's powerful offensive in the Huaihai area, the Chiang and American reactionaries have fallen into a state of panic. According to Central News Agency reports: Simultaneously with the Nanjing Garrison Area (east to Shanghai, west to Anqing, south to Hangzhou, north to Bengbu) declaring martial law on the 10th of this month, the Chiang bandit has already removed Sun Lianzhong, of the original Northwest Army system, from his position as Kuomintang "Capital Garrison Commander" and replaced him with his trusted confidant, Chen Jicheng. On the 13th, the Chiang bandit again dismissed Chen and replaced him with another close associate, Zhang Zhen, the former Commander of the Kuomintang Logistics and Military Police. The families of Nanjing Kuomintang government officials are rushing to obtain passports to flee to the United States, with "plane tickets to the United States already booked until February of next year" (United Press). The Kuomintang's "Capital Garrison Headquarters" had already ordered the police department at the end of last month to investigate all transportation in the city in preparation for requisition. Outside the Jiangwan and Dachang airfields in Shanghai, preparations are underway to build fortifications. In Shanghai and Hankou, Kuomintang bandits dispatched tens of thousands of police and military police on the nights of the 8th and 9th respectively to conduct fascist "total household registration checks." The Shanghai side is also preparing to force a large number of citizens to leave the city by stopping the issuance of ration cards. According to Tianjin newspapers, Bengbu, located 360 miles north of Nanjing on the Jinpu Railway line, issued an emergency evacuation order on October 18th, and the Kuomintang Engineering School there has fled in a sorry state to Nanjing. On the 4th of this month, an editorial in the Nanjing Central Daily News admitted that popular support had been lost and lamented retreating south of the Yangtze River. On the 12th, an editorial by the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department admitted that "defeatism" and "surrenderist toxins" are being "spread" within the Kuomintang reactionaries.

    At the same time, according to a US Information Service report from Nanjing on the 10th: The families of the US Joint Military Advisory Group stationed in various locations will be concentrated in Shanghai and Qingdao starting from the 11th in preparation for evacuation. According to an Associated Press report from Nanjing on the 5th: The US Embassy notified American citizens on the 5th to leave the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, announcing that before this decision, "US Embassy military personnel had stated that the Kuomintang government no longer had the material ability to keep the war away from the capital."

　　在我淮海攻势震撼下
    蒋美反动派大慌乱
  　中央日报哀鸣退守长江以南
    【新华社陕北十五日电】在人民解放军淮海地区强大攻势震撼下，蒋、美反动派已陷于一片慌乱。据中央社电讯透露：与本月十日南京卫戍区（东至上海、西至安庆、南至杭州、北至蚌埠）宣布戒严的同时，蒋贼已将原西北军系统之国民党“首都卫戍总司令”孙连仲撤职，而代之嫡系心腹陈继承。十三日，蒋贼又将陈免职，代之以另一亲信前国民党后勤宪兵总司令张镇。南京国民党政府大官的眷属，正纷纷领取护照逃亡美国，“赴美飞机票已登记到明年二月”（合众社）。国民党的“首都卫戍司令部”早已于上月底下令警察厅调查全市交通工具，以备征用。上海江湾大场两飞机场外围上准备修筑工事。沪、汉两地国民党匪帮分别于八日及九日深夜出动警察、宪兵数万名，进行法西斯的“户口总清查”。上海方面并准备以停发配给证强迫大量市民离境。据天津报纸披露：位于南京以北三百六十里津浦线上的蚌埠，已于十月十八日发出紧急疏散令，该地国民党工兵学校已狼狈迁往南京。本月四日南京中央日报社论承认人心已失，哀鸣退守长江以南。十二日国民党中宣部社论承认国民党反动派内部正“传播”着“失败主义”与“投降主义毒素”。
    与此同时，据美新闻处南京十日消息：美国联合军事顾问团驻各地眷属，于十一日起集中上海青岛，准备撤退。据美联社南京五日电称：美国大使馆于五日通知侨民离开京、沪地区，宣布该决定之前，“美大使馆军事人员曾提出，国民党政府已不再有使战争远离首都的物质能力了。”
