　　Canadian Port of Vancouver Students
  　Demonstrate Against Military Aid to Chiang Kai-shek
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd—The crimes of the Canadian government, the running dog of American imperialism, in continuing to aid Chiang Kai-shek with military supplies, have aroused righteous protests from Canadian students. According to a Vancouver dispatch from the 18th: Students at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver declared that they were prepared to set up picket lines in the area of the Post Office (a federal agency managing postal, transportation, and shipping affairs) to prevent the Canadian ship "Island Side" from loading and departing with military supplies for Chiang. They also stated that they had decided to protest to the Canadian government's port authority. According to an Associated Press report: The Canadian ship "Island Side" is docked in the port of Vancouver, preparing to load 5,000 tons of military supplies and thirty "Mosquito" bombers to sail to Shanghai.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd—Vancouver, 19th—Seventy students from the University of British Columbia held a demonstration in the port on the 18th against the Canadian government's aid to Chiang Kai-shek with aircraft and military supplies. Forty of the students formed a picket line at the local federal agency, the Post Office, while the remaining thirty picketed the "Island Side" ship, which was scheduled to sail on the 22nd carrying military supplies. The demonstrating students held up signs that read, "You should not kill the Chinese people!" "Not a single plane, not a single gun for Wall Street's Chiang Kai-shek!" "Do not interfere in China!" "We, the youth, protest the slaughter!"
