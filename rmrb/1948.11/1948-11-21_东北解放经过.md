Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 18th: A correspondent from our branch has summarized the liberation of Northeast China, stating that the liberation of the entire Northeast region took more than three years. Militarily speaking, it can be roughly depicted in four diagrams showing the changing situations of the enemy and ourselves:

On the first map, the markings that must be noted are: After the Japanese surrendered, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, with the help of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, gathered a superior force and first invaded along the Beining Railway from October 27th to November 29th, 1945, successively occupying Qinhuangdao, Shanhaiguan, Suizhong, Jinxi, and the strategic point of Jinzhou. Following that, from December 23rd of the same year to March 20th of the following year (1946), they divided their forces into three routes: attacking Fuxin and Zhangwu in the north, directly threatening Shenyang; occupying Yingkou and Panshan in the south, controlling coastal fortresses; and fiercely attacking the Jin-Cheng Railway in the west, capturing towns along the line. At the same time, an elite force invaded large areas of Rehe and Liaoning. On March 13th, the enemy entered Shenyang and then quickly expanded outwards, on one hand opening up the southern section of the Changchun Railway, and on the other hand moving north to seize Kaiyuan, Changtu, Faku, and other places, and began attacking Siping. Our army launched a heroic defense of Siping for more than a month starting in early April, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. On May 18th, we proactively withdrew from the area, and then withdrew from Changchun and Jilin. The enemy then invaded the above-mentioned areas and controlled the Shenyang-Jilin section of the Shenyang-Jilin Railway, the Hailong-Jilin section, and the Siping-Meihekou section of the Siping-Meihekou Railway. After several months of rest and reinforcement, the enemy began a frantic invasion in early October: the enemy first used part of its forces to open up the Fushun-Meihekou section of the Shenyang-Jilin line, then occupied Andong and the Liaonan area with heavy forces, then turned eastward to seize Tonghua, Huanren, and Jian. The western forces adopted a nibbling and leaping posture, relying on Zhengjiatun, and invaded Tongliao, Kailu, and Changling in various directions. The enemy advancing northward on the main front adopted small-scale harassment and espionage activities to coordinate the entire campaign. For about two months thereafter, our South Manchuria Liberated Area was divided piece by piece, leaving only Linjiang at the foot of Changbai Mountain. Du Yuming, the leader of the Northeast Chiang Kai-shek bandits, repeatedly claimed that he would completely seize the Northeast. However, in the course of over a year, our army adopted an offensive defense, mainly to weaken the enemy's strength and maintain and develop our own strength, winning the annihilation of more than 60,000 enemies, and winning the uprising of Pan Shuoduan's troops, dispersing the arrogant enemy in more than 50 large and small cities and 3,000 kilometers of railway lines, laying the seeds for an irreparable defeat.

Therefore, on the second map, a different scene appeared, that is, from January to April 1947, there were several large spearheads pointing to the enemy's hinterland, the most striking of which were our army's four crossings of the Songhua River in North Manchuria and our army's four defenses of Linjiang in South Manchuria. At that time, the enemy still adhered to the policy of attacking the south and defending the north, gathering all the forces it could gather, attempting to occupy the narrow area of the Changbai Mountains, eliminate our main force in South Manchuria, and then attack North Manchuria. However, our army unexpectedly, when they attacked Linjiang each time, the North Manchurian forces took the initiative to advance into the south of the Songhua River, threatening Jilin and Changchun, so that South Manchuria could continuously crush their attacks and recover Liuhe, Huinan, Jian, Huanren and other places. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits lost sight of the beginning and the end, and completely disrupted their operational deployment. We basically stopped the enemy's strategic offensive and forced them to adopt "mobile defense."

Then, the third map changed to another situation - what is most obvious on it is that from May of last year to March of this year, our army launched three consecutive powerful offensives in summer, autumn and winter, causing the enemy to lose more than 300,000 troops, and shrinking the enemy's occupied area, which accounted for about 30% of the total area of ​​the Northeast, to 2%. The enemy was isolated and divided, while we were connected from east to west and north to south. The emergence of this situation is due to the fact that under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau, all party, government, army, and people have worked hard for more than a year, carried out land reform, and strengthened their own strength, especially the heroic and good fighting of the Northeast People's Liberation Army under the brilliant command of General Lin Biao. After the summer offensive opened in mid-May last year, our army launched simultaneous offensives from all battlefields in the southeast, northwest, with the momentum of thunder, and captured 42 small and medium cities in more than 50 days, cut off the strategic transportation lines between Jilin and Shenyang, surrounded Sipingjie, disrupted the enemy's entire defense system, and roughly restored the enemy's occupied Siping, Jilin-Changchun and previous situations. Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly replaced Du Yuming with his Chief of Staff Chen Cheng. But as soon as Chen Cheng took office, our army's autumn offensive was launched in mid-September. First, in the three battles and three victories in the Liaoxi area, we gave the enemy's 49th Army and other main forces that had been transferred from within the passes a devastating blow, cut off the Beining Road, then cut off the Changchun Road, and then returned to the north to capture Jiutai, Nong'an, Dehui and other places, making the two cities of Jilin and Changchun completely isolated, making the entire enemy shrink into the 24 cities in the narrow area of ​​the Beining and Changchun Road south sections, completely exposing their awkward situation of being beaten. The winter offensive started on December 15. Our army braved the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius and carried out a series of fortification operations, capturing the important towns of Zhangwu, Xinlitun, Liaoyang, Anshan, and Siping, which had strong fortifications, and annihilating all the defending enemies in these areas, recovering the important port of Yingkou, and forcing the enemy in North Manchuria to withdraw from Jilin, and Chiang Kai-shek again dismissed Chen Cheng and replaced him with Wei Lihuang. As a result of this offensive, only 12 isolated strongholds, including Changchun, Shenyang and its surrounding areas, and Jinxi and Jinzhou on the Beining Line, were left on the map of the nine provinces of the Northeast. We completely grasped the initiative of the war and made the entire Northeast advance to the eve of liberation of the entire territory.

By September of this year, the fourth more magnificent map was unfolded. After the winter offensive, the People's Liberation Army launched a huge offensive on September 12 after more than four months of new-style reorganization and training, first attacking the enemy's only lifeline, the Beining Road, dividing, encircling, and removing the strongholds along the line, and then capturing Yixian on October 1 and capturing the strategic point of Jinzhou City on the 15th, annihilating 100,000 enemies and capturing Fan Hanjie, the deputy commander-in-chief of the enemy's Northeast "Suppression Headquarters." The victory in Jinzhou directly promoted the uprising of the 60th Army in Changchun, which had been besieged for several months, and the surrender of another deputy commander-in-chief, Zheng Dongguo, with his troops. The city was declared liberated without bloodshed on the 19th. On the 28th of the same month, our army annihilated five armies of the fleeing enemy Liao Yaoxiang Corps in the Liaoxi area, and went straight to the bandit's nest of Shenyang. On the 2nd of this month, the city was completely captured, and at the same time, the remaining enemies who fled south were cleared and Yingkou was recovered. At this point, the Northeast People's Liberation Army has completed its great cause; 34 million people celebrate the liberation of the entire territory. There will be no more wars on this map in the future. What will replace war will be large-scale economic construction, especially the restoration and development of industry. The Northeast will become an important base for supporting the national liberation war and national economic construction, and will forever shine in the upper right corner of the map of New China.

　　东北解放经过
    【新华社哈尔滨十八日电】分社记者综述解放东北经过称：东北全境的解放先后经过了三年多的时间，从军事上说，大致可画四幅敌我形势变化图：
    在第一幅地图上，必须标明的记号是：日寇投降以后，蒋匪在美国太平洋舰队帮助下集结了优势兵力，首先于一九四五年十月廿七日至十一月二十九日间，以十万之师沿北宁路进犯，连占秦皇岛、山海关、绥中、锦西、及战略要点锦州等。继即于同年十二月二十三日至次年（一九四六年）三月二十日分兵三路：北攻阜新、彰武直逼沈阳，南占营口、盘山，控制沿海要塞，西向锦承路猛犯，攻陷沿线各城镇。同时并以精锐一部侵占热辽大片地区。三月十三日敌进入沈阳，其后即迅速向外围扩展，一面打通中长路南段，一面北上夺取开源、昌图、法库等地，并开始进攻四平。我军于四月上旬起进行了一个多月的英勇的四平保卫战，予敌以重大打击后，于五月十八日主动撤离该地，继又撤出长春、吉林，敌于是侵入上述各地，并控制了沈（阳）吉（林）路海（龙）吉（林）段，四（平）梅（河口）路之四梅段城镇。至此敌经数月休整增援后，又于十月初起开始了疯狂的进犯：敌先以一部兵力打通沈吉线之抚（顺）梅（河口）段，复以重兵进占安东及辽南地区，再折向东，夺取通化、桓仁及辑安等地，其西线部队则以蚕食跃进姿态，依托郑家屯，分途侵入通辽、开鲁及长岭各地。其正面向北满推进之敌，采取小股扰袭及特务活动，以配合整个战役行动。此后约两个多月，我南满解放区遭其逐块分割，仅存长白山麓之临江。东北蒋匪首领杜聿明曾一再扬言要全部霸估东北。然而我军在此年余时间中，采取了攻势防御，以削弱敌人的有生力量，保持与发展自己的有生力量为主，赢得了歼灭敌人六万余，并争取潘朔端部的起义，将骄傲之敌分散于五十余座大小城市及三千余公里的铁路线上，使其埋下了难以挽回的失败种子。
    因此，在第二幅地图上，就出现了另一种情景，那就是一九四七年一月至四月间有着几支大矛头指向敌人的腹地，其中最为醒目的是北满我军的四下江南与南满我军的四保临江。当时敌仍以南攻北守的方针，集结其能够集结的兵力，企图占据长白山脉的狭小地带，消灭我南满主力，再攻北满。可是我军却出其不意，当其每次进攻临江时，北满部队即主动挺进松花江南，威逼吉长各地，使南满得以连续粉碎其进攻，并收复柳河、辉南、辑安、桓仁等地。蒋匪首尾失顾，完全紊乱了作战部署。我则基本上停止了敌人的战略进攻，并迫使其采取了“机动防御”。
    于是第三幅地图，就回然改变了另一种局势——在这上面最为显明的是去年五月至今年三月间，我军连续发动夏秋冬三次强大攻势，使敌人的有生力量损失三十余万，使敌人约占全东北面积百分之三十左右的占领区，缩小到百分之二。敌人陷于孤立分割，我则东西南北连成一片。这个局面的出现，由于在中共中央和东北局的领导下，全体党政军民经过了年余的艰苦奋斗，进行了土地改革，壮大了自己力量，特别是东北解放军在林彪将军的英明指挥下英勇善战的结果。当去年五月中旬，夏季攻势揭幕之后，我军即以雷霆万钧之势，从东南西北各个战场上同时进攻，于五十余天内，连克中小城市四十二座，切断了吉沈两地的战略交通线，包围了四平街，打乱了敌人的整个防御体系，大体上恢复了敌占四平、吉（林）长（春）以前的态势。蒋介石急忙用他的参谋总长陈诚来代替杜聿明。但陈诚刚一上任，我军的秋季攻势即于九月中旬发动，先于辽西地区的三战三捷中，予关内增来之敌四十九军主力等以歼灭性的打击，切断北宁路，再斩中长路，然后回兵北上，攻占九台、农安、德惠等地，使吉长两城完全孤立，使整个敌人龟缩入北宁及中长路南段狭小地带的二十四个城市内，完全裸露其挨打的窘态。冬季攻势由十二月十五日开始，我军冒零下三十余度严寒，进行了一连串的攻坚作战，打下了有强固工事设备的彰武、新立屯、辽阳、鞍山、四平等重镇，并全歼各该地守敌，收复要港营口，迫使北满之敌撤出吉林，并使蒋介石又将陈诚撤职，换来卫立煌。由于这一次攻势的结果，在东北九省的版图上就只余下了长春、沈阳及其周围与北宁线上的锦西、锦州等十二个孤立据点，我即完全掌握了战争的主动权，使整个东北迈进了全境解放的前夜。
    到了今年九月，第四幅更壮观的地图展开了。人民解放军继冬季攻势后，经四个多月的新式整训，于九月十二日发起巨大攻势，首先奔袭敌人唯一生命线北宁路，将沿线各据点分割、包围、拔除，然后于十月一日攻克义县，十五日攻克战略要点锦州城，歼敌十万，活捉敌东北“剿总”副总司令范汉杰。锦州的胜利直接促成了被围数月的长春六十军的起义，及另一个副总司令郑洞国的率部投降。城遂于十九日兵不血刃宣告解放。同月二十八日，我军再于辽西地区全歼逃敌廖耀湘兵团五个军，直捣匪巢沈阳，本月二日，完全攻克该城，并于同时扫清南窜残敌，收复营口。至此，东北人民解放军大功乃告完成；三千四百万人民欢庆全境解放。今后在这幅地图上再没有战争了，代替战争的将是大规模的经济建设，特别是工业的恢复与发展。东北将成为支援全国解放战争和全国经济建设的重要基地，永远辉耀于新中国版图上的右上角。
