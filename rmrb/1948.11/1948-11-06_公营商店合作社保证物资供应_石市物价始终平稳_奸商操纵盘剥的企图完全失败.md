　　State-Owned Stores and Cooperatives Guarantee Supply of Goods
  　Shijiazhuang's Commodity Prices Remain Stable
    The Enemy's Attempt to Manipulate and Exploit Fails Completely
    [Report from this newspaper] The Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit troops who attempted to sneak attack Shijiazhuang have been repelled by the People's Liberation Army, and the people's city of Shijiazhuang is gradually returning to normal. This reporter witnessed the orderly preparations for war in Shijiazhuang, and the most commendable aspect was the democratic government's efforts to stabilize the market and commodity prices. During the war preparations, citizens actively stored grain, and some unscrupulous merchants, driven by profit, took the opportunity to raise prices. On the morning of the 27th, the grain market fluctuated briefly. Millet rose from 370 yuan per catty to 600 yuan, and white flour rose from 500 yuan per catty to nearly 1,000 yuan. State-owned stores and grain shops immediately sold large quantities of grain, supplying citizens without restriction, and by 11:00 am that day, grain prices had completely returned to their pre-war levels. The municipal authorities convened a city-wide meeting of state-owned enterprises, stipulating that state-owned enterprises and stores should guarantee the supply of essential living materials for 200,000 citizens during the war preparations, stand firm in their positions, and fight against unscrupulous merchants. All state-owned stores extended their business hours and supplied essential goods such as grain, cloth, oil, salt, and coal at regular prices. The government helped various production cooperatives to switch to wartime supply and marketing operations, so that the cooperatives would not have to suspend operations due to war preparations and could become a strong assistant to state-owned stores. From the 26th to the 29th, 32 production cooperatives evacuated their production tools and raw materials, went to the city promotion agency to handle supply and marketing procedures, purchased necessities from the trade company at normal prices, and sold them to citizens at prices lower than the market price. State-owned enterprises and factories all advanced half a month or twenty days' wages to their employees, and supplied them and their families with necessities at the market prices of the first half of the month, depriving unscrupulous merchants of a large target for exploitation. At the same time, the municipal authorities held a forum for private industrialists and businessmen, explaining the war situation, pointing out that price fluctuations were also harmful to industrialists and businessmen, and hoping that everyone would voluntarily rise up to oppose the illegal acts of a few people who hoarded and speculated, seeking exorbitant profits. These effective measures ensured that Shijiazhuang's commodity prices remained stable. Citizens said, "The democratic government is really thoughtful. In the most tense times, they are even more concerned about the common people."

　　公营商店合作社保证物资供应
  　石市物价始终平稳
    奸商操纵盘剥的企图完全失败
    【本报讯】妄图偷袭石家庄的蒋傅匪军已被人民解放军打退了，人民城市石家庄逐渐恢复常态。记者目睹石市此次备战，有条不紊，最足称道者，为民主政府安定市场、平稳物价所作的努力。在备战期间，市民纷纷储备粮食，某些不法商人唯利是图，乘机高抬物价，二十七日上午，粮食市场一度波动。小米由每斤三百七十元涨至六百元，白面由每斤五百元涨至近千元。公营商店、粮店立即抛售大批粮食，无限制的供应市民，当日十一时粮价完全恢复备战以前状态。市政当局召开了全市公营企业会议，规定公营企业和商店在备战期间，保证廿万市民生活资料的供应，坚守自己的岗位，和奸商作斗争。各公营商店都延长了营业时间，按常价供应粮食、布匹、油盐、煤炭等必需品。政府帮助各种生产合作社转营战时供销业务，合作社既可不因备战停顿经营，又能成为公营商店有力的助手。从二十六日至二十九日，有三十二个生产合作社疏散了生产工具和原料，到市推进社办理供销手续，按平常价格到贸易公司批购必需品，以低于市价的价格售给市民。公营企业、工厂均预借给职工半月或二十天的工资，并按上半月市价供给职工及其家属必需品。使不法商人失却一大盘剥对象。市政当局同时召开了私营工商业者座谈会，阐明战争形势，说明物价波动对工商业者也有害处，希望大家自动起来反对少数人的囤集居奇、食图暴利的不法行为。这些有效措施，保证了石市物价始终平稳，市民们说：“民主政府想的真周到。在最紧张的时候，更是关心老百姓。”
