Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 29th. Under the slogans of "No sand, no chaff" and "Support the front lines in fighting Chiang Kai-shek," the masses in various parts of the Hebei-Shanxi region are competing to pay public grain. As soon as the autumn grain was harvested and brought home by the masses in the Zhengding border area, every household busied themselves sewing cloth bags, baking dry rations, and preparing travel expenses. Some families did not have pockets, so the old women temporarily sewed door curtains and bundles into cloth bags. One village delivered the vast majority of the village's public grain to the designated location overnight. A district office received more than 500 carts of public grain, totaling more than 250,000 jin, on the evening of September 30th. The masses in the third district of Tang County paid grain money overnight, completing more than 15 million yuan in three days. For example, villages such as Beizhuangzi, Yangjiazhuang, and Wanggezhuang completed 4,526,200 yuan in one night.

　　冀晋区群众争先缴公粮
    【新华社晋察冀二十九日电】在“没有砂子没有糠”及“支援前线打蒋贼”的口号下，冀晋各地群众争先缴纳公粮。正定边沿区群众秋粮刚收至家中，家家户户即忙碌缝制布袋、烙干粮、备路费。有些人家没有口袋，老太太们即把门帘包袱等临时缝成布袋。某村一夜工夫将全村公粮绝大部分送缴指定地点。某区区公所即在九月三十日晚上收到交纳的公粮五百余车，总计二十五万余斤。唐县三区群众连夜交纳粮款，三日内即完成一万五千余万元。如北庄子、杨家庄、王各庄等村一夜即完成四百五十二万六千二百元。
