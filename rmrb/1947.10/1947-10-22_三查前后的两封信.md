　　Two Letters Before and After the Three Checks
    Taiyue Branch

    Comrade Liu Zucheng was a doctor at the First Direct Hospital of the Health Department of the Taiyue Military Region. He was from Chengguan, Wuxiang, and came from a landlord-bureaucrat family. Although he had joined the People's Liberation Army for seven or eight years, his landlord ideology was still very serious. He took a completely antagonistic attitude towards the masses' struggle against his family, and even wrote to threaten the Wuxiang County Head and County Committee, saying, "When we meet in the future, I will revolutionize the lives of my own comrades." Recently, after the speak bitterness movement, his thinking has begun to change. He wrote to the District Head to apologize, and hoped that the masses would thoroughly struggle against his family. Here are his two letters before and after.

    First Letter: To County Head Li and Political Commissar Li: I am originally from Xuetao Lane in Chengnai, this county. In 1939, I joined our army in Qin County and have been working in the Health Department of the Taiyue Military Region for eight years. I am still working at the First Direct Hospital of this Health Department. The last time I went back, I met County Head Li and talked about my family situation. County Head Li wrote to the Fifth District Office, asking them to resolve the matter according to the specific actual situation. I felt very satisfied, so I happily returned to my original unit. However, not long after I left, I heard that the responsible comrades of the district and village offices not only did not manage this matter much, but instead found fault in many ways and carried out repeated struggles. I tried to get my mother to forcibly retain more than 10,000 yuan of public funds at home. They tried to buy some grain, but as a result, the masses struggled and ran away with it. Can the masses really be unreasonable? Alas! Soldiers are really a bit...

    Originally, I shouldn't have asked the government to help. This principle is the party's policy in land reform, and I understand it somewhat, but when the actual problem comes, it is really a bit difficult to bear. If there is really a crime or a local tyrant, it should be beaten to death. The current problem is not the case, it is deliberately like this, then I will have to revolutionize the lives of my own comrades when we meet in the future. This is a last resort, but it may be possible to take it when it is really unbearable. ...

    Please, County Head and Political Commissar of the County Government, take a look at the specific actual situation and resolve it. This is my hope. I will talk more later. I wish County Head, Political Commissar, and other responsible comrades good health, and extend my respects.

    　　　　　Liu Zucheng, August 27th

    Second Letter: The District Head's letter has been received, don't worry. I hope you are all in good health, and that your work is going smoothly. I wish you all the best, and hope that you will bravely and vigorously advance forward to complete the party's historical task (land reform), standing on the position of serving the people. ... Just as our troops were vigorously carrying out a speak bitterness movement in which everyone hated the landlord Chiang Kai-shek and everyone shed tears, I received a letter from Comrade District Head on September 23rd. After receiving the letter, I read it three times in order, and after reading it, I felt very happy and also felt sorry.

    Indeed, for a long time, my understanding of the peasant struggle issue was not clear enough, especially the issue of standpoint. Today, looking back, it is very scary to stand with the landlords. I have been revolutionizing for seven or eight years, and this kind of revolution is detrimental to the peasants, and it also cannot make the work better. After reading Comrade District Head's letter, I am very grateful to the cadres of the District Government for this attitude of being responsible to comrades and being responsible to the party, which is worthy of my study bit by bit in my future work. This is also the direction (standpoint issue) that I should rapidly strive to improve in the future. Since my unit launched the speak bitterness movement, there has also been a thorough reckoning in my personal thoughts. The problems that I did not understand clearly before, I understand today. The problems that I recognized vaguely before, I recognize clearly today. Therefore, in this letter, I would like to explain to you that what I said before about taking care of the problem was entirely standing on the landlord's standpoint and giving the landlord a bomb shelter, fearing that the landlord's tail would be completely cut off (this refers to my family). Therefore, I will no longer let the government take care of it.

    Regarding my family's problem, I don't know the specific situation now, and I don't know anything about the internal property issues. Please understand it slowly in the future. If the struggle is not thorough enough, it can continue until the landlord remnants are completely eliminated. I would like to explain to the government now that from today onwards, not only am I not afraid of the peasants struggling against my family, but I also advocate that the peasants actively struggle, and I will be even happier this way. I will not talk about any so-called care problems today.

    Please, District Head, after seeing this letter, forward it to County Head, Political Commissar, and cadres of Chengguan Village Office, and talk again. With revolutionary greetings.

    　　　　Liu Zucheng, September 17th

### 三查前后的两封信

　　三查前后的两封信
    太岳分社
    刘祖成同志是太岳军区卫生部直属一所的医生，武乡城关人，家庭是地主官僚，参加解放军虽已七八年之久，但地主思想仍很严重。他对于群众斗争他家，完全采取对立的态度，甚至写信威胁武乡县长、县委说：“待以后能见面时，自己革自己同志的命吧。”最近经过诉苦运动，他的思想已开始转变，写信给区长赔不是，并希望群众彻底斗争他家。这里就是他前后两封信。
    第一封信：李县长、李政委台鉴：敝人是本县城内原学道巷人，于一九三九年由沁县参加我军，在太岳军区卫生部工作，已八年之久，现仍在本卫生部直属一所工作。上次我回去时，曾见李县长，谈了我家情况，李县长写信给五区区公所，让按具体实际情况予以解决。我觉得很满意，于是高兴地转回我原部队工作。可是我走后不久，听说该区及村公所各负责同志，对此事不但不多管，反而在多方面找些岔子，进行反复斗争。我在家中想法将公款给我母强留一万元之多，她们设法买了些粮食，结果亦被群众斗争跑了，群众真的还能不说理吗？唉！当兵的人可真有些那个。
    本来，我是不该当提让政府想法帮助之事。这道理在土改中是党的政策，我亦了解些，但实际问题来了，可是真有些难过。如果真有罪，有恶霸，就打死也是应当。现在问题则不然，故意这样，那只好待以后能见面时自己革自己同志的命吧。这是不得已的一条错路子了，可是到真正难忍的时候，也许可能走。……
    请贵县政府县长、政委首长看一下具体实际情况，予以解决，是我之盼。余言再谈，祝贵县长政委等各负责同志身体健康，致以敬礼。
    　　　　　刘祖成八月廿七日
    第二封信：区长来信收阅，希勿念。近来各位贵体健康，工作顺利，祝你一切安好，并望各位为完成党的历史任务（土地改革），站在为民服务的立场上，勇敢大踏步的向前推进……。正当我们部队轰轰烈烈的开展着人人痛恨地主蒋介石，个个落泪的诉苦运动之际，我于九月二十三日接见区长同志来信一封。接信后，即顺序阅读三回，读后我自己觉得很高兴，又觉得对不起。
    我的确好长时间了，对农民斗争问题是了解不够清楚的，特别是立场问题。在今天，检讨起来，是很可怕的与地主站在一块儿。革命了七八年，这样革命是对农民不利的，这样也不能把工作做的更好。我阅读区长同志之信后，我非常感谢区政府各干部这种对同志负责，对党负责的态度，是值得我以后在工作中点滴学习的。这也就是我今后所应当急速努力改进的方向（立场问题）。从我部队开展诉苦运动以来，在我个人思想上也有了一个彻底清算，以前所了解不清楚的问题，今天也了解了，以前认识模糊的问题，今天也认识清楚了，所以我在这信中向各位说明以前所说照顾问题，那完全是站在地主立场上给地主造防空洞的意思，怕把地主尾巴完全割掉（这是指我家说）。因而，再不让政府照顾。
    关于我家问题，现在具体情况我不了解，内产问题，我亦都不清楚，请你们日后慢慢了解吧。如果斗争还不够彻底，还可继续斗下去，一直到把地主残余斗光。我现在向政府说明，从今天以后，我不但不怕农民斗争我家，而且主张农民积极的斗争，这样我才更高兴，所谓什么照顾问题，今天都不谈。
    请区长见信后，转县政府县长、政委及城关村公所各干部同志，再谈。致以革命的敬礼。
    　　　　刘祖成九月十七日
