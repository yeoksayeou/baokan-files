Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: TASS special correspondent reports: On September 26th, Vyshinsky held a grand press conference at Lake Success UN Headquarters, elaborating on his speech to the General Assembly on the 18th. Seven hundred people attended, lasting two and a half hours. The audience was deeply impressed by Vyshinsky's speech, and repeatedly responded with approving laughter due to his vivid criticisms. Vyshinsky first refuted the recent sophistry and denials of American warmongers Dulles, Ohr, etc.; and also pointed out the names of other warmongers such as Bullitt, Winchell, and other reactionary remarks. Vyshinsky believed that the speech of British representative McNair at the General Assembly was strange, and condemned him for defending Churchill and denying the possibility of disarmament on the pretext that "collective security has no basis." Vyshinsky said that McNair refused to punish instigators of a new war, but people would wonder why trafficking in women and children could be imprisoned, while the crime of trafficking in war, which most hinders freedom, progress, and human welfare, should be an exception. Vyshinsky stated: It has been eight days since my speech at the General Assembly on the 18th. Has anyone opposed our proposal against warmongers? No. What have warmongers used to refute the facts we have listed? Nothing either. Although Dulles stated that he had not made propaganda instigating a new war, Dulles's article published in Life magazine on January 17th this year said: "Because the Soviet Union's 'aggressiveness' has caused a 'resistance' from the United States and Britain that is stronger than the Soviet leaders are willing to see, in those countries public opinion is rapidly becoming tougher, supporting measures to rebuild military institutions, military institutions are not allowed to disintegrate, the United States is showing its naval and air power in the Mediterranean, and if the Soviet Union continues on its original path, it seems that it will cause a major war." By analyzing this statement, people can easily come to the conclusion I made: Dulles's demands on Soviet foreign policy increase the danger of war. In answering a question from Robert Manning of the Associated Press about how to improve US-Soviet relations, Vyshinsky said: The four suggestions made by the Soviet Union to the General Assembly against instigators of new wars are one of the ways to improve Soviet-American relations. If the United States abandons its attempts to undermine the UN Charter and abandons its attempts to establish a "Provisional Committee on Peace and Security" and a "Little Assembly" that block the road to cooperation, it will make cooperation between the two countries possible and lasting. Vyshinsky criticized those who pay lip service to international cooperation, saying: Do you want cooperation like the relationship between a rider and his horse? But we oppose this kind of cooperation. The Soviet Union will never act as a horse. Perhaps some countries like this kind of "cooperation," especially those that have been seduced by the so-called "Marshall Plan." Maybe they like the horse owner riding on their backs, then let them. Reporters from the Christian Science Monitor, the Chicago Daily News, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, CBS, the New York Daily News, and the New York Times jointly asked some questions, especially asking whether the Soviet Union would participate if the "Provisional Committee on Peace and Security" had been established. Vyshinsky replied: "When certain other things happen, I don't answer questions about what will happen. The Soviet delegation insists that this committee should not exist and makes every effort to prevent its establishment." The six reporters then asked what policy the Soviet Union would adopt if negotiations on atomic energy control and universal disarmament failed. Vyshinsky believed that the six reporters were obviously infected with pessimism, and he said, "I don't want to join their group." The six reporters also asked whether the news organizations and individuals who incited war sentiment represent the attitude of the entire American people towards the Soviet Union. Vyshinsky replied: "The Soviet delegation would be pessimists if they compared warmongers with the American people in the slightest! Dear six reporters, put your pessimistic ideas on the shelf!" In answering questions about the Korean issue, Vyshinsky pointed out: The General Assembly should remove this agenda because the Assembly has nothing to do with this issue and is in conflict with the Charter. This issue should be resolved by correctly implementing the obligations of the three powers, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The reporter group then raised a question: Are you condemning the US government for privately engaging in war propaganda? Vyshinsky replied: "We are talking about the reactionaries in certain countries, especially individuals, private institutions, private newspaper publishers, capitalists, and individual representatives of the US government in the United States who are engaged in war propaganda."
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Reports from all sides: The shock and confusion caused by Vyshinsky's righteous and stern speech at the UN General Assembly on the 18th among American reactionaries has not disappeared to this day. Even US officials admit: "Vyshinsky's speech seriously disrupted American public opinion" (United Press International, 29th). According to a report by the Soviet Labor Newspaper's correspondent stationed at the United Nations, according to American newspapers, the American delegation had spent a long time preparing its so-called "offensive" before the opening of this General Assembly. Marshall's speech was rewritten at least five times, and finally revised by the notorious Dulles. But Vyshinsky's speech destroyed all their tricks. The Soviet proposal became the center of the General Assembly and public opinion. The representatives of large monopoly capital and newspapers have been forced to defend themselves with clumsy and unfounded denials. The reporter revealed that the chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the reactionary leader Vandenberg, dared not show his face and refused to participate in the work of the US delegation, "because he had predetermined that if he participated in the US delegation to the General Assembly, it would reduce his chances in the next presidential election."

### 在联合国总部记者招待会上　维辛斯基再斥战争贩子

　　在联合国总部记者招待会上
  　维辛斯基再斥战争贩子
    【新华社陕北二日电】据塔斯社特派记者报导：上月二十六日维辛斯基于成功湖联合国总部举行盛大之记者招待会，阐释其十八日在联大的演讲。到会者七百人，历时两小时半，会众对维氏谈话印象极深，且因其批评生动，不断报以赞同的笑声。维氏首对美国战争贩子杜勒斯、欧尔等近日来的诡辩和否认，予以驳斥；并又指出另一些战争贩子布立特、温契尔等之名字及其他反动言论。维氏认为英代表麦克纳尔在联大会上的演说是奇怪的，并谴责其为邱吉尔辩护及借口“集体安全没有基础”而否认裁军的可能。维氏说麦克纳尔拒绝处罚新战争的挑拨者，但人们会奇怪为什么贩卖妇女儿童可以受到监禁，而贩卖战争这种妨碍自由进步与人类福利最甚的罪行则应例外。维氏称：我十八日在联大演说后已经八天了，有谁反对我们反战争贩子的建议没有？没有。战争贩子们用什么反驳我们所列举的事实？也没有。虽然杜勒斯声明他没有作过新战争挑拨的宣传，然而今年一月十七日在生活杂志上发表的杜勒斯的论文说：“因为苏联的‘侵略性’引起了比苏联领袖所愿意的更强硬的美英两国的‘抵抗’，在那些国家中舆论迅趋强硬，支持重建军事机构的措施，军事机构是不容许瓦解的，美国在地中海表现它的海空军力量，假若苏联继续走着原定的道路，那似乎就要引起大战。”将这言论作一分析，人们很容易得出我所作的结论：杜勒斯这种对苏外交政策的要求，增涨了战争的危险。维氏在答复合众社记者罗伯特·曼宁关于如何改进美苏关系的问题时称：苏联向联大所提反对新战争煽动者的四项建议，是改进苏美关系方法之一。美国如果放弃破坏联合国宪章的企图，放弃建立堵塞合作道路的“和平安全临时委员会”及“小型大会”的企图，则将使两国合作成为可能而且是持久的。维氏抨击空谈国际合作的人们说：你们是要骑马的人和他的马之间的关系那样的合作吗？但是我们反对这种合作，苏联决不充当马。可能有些国家喜欢这种“合作”，尤其可能为那些被所谓“马歇尔计划”所诱惑的国家喜欢，也许他们喜欢马主骑在他背上，那就由他们好了。基督教科学箴言报、芝加哥日报、圣路易斯邮报、哥伦比亚广播公司、纽约新闻和时代的记者们联合询问了某些问题，特别问到假如“和平安全临时委员会”已经建立，苏联是否参加？维氏答称：“当某些另外事情发生的时候，我不答复什么将要发生的问题。苏联代表团坚持这一委员会不应存在，并且尽各种努力阻止它的建立。”该六记者又询以设若原子能管制和普遍裁军的商谈失败，苏联将采何种方针？维氏认为：该六记者显然沾染了悲观主义，他说：“我不愿意参加他们这一伙。”该六记者并问煽动战争情绪的新闻机关与个人，表示美国全体人民对苏联的态度吗？维氏答称：“苏联代表团如有一丝一毫的把战争贩子与美国人民相提并论，便是悲观主义者！亲爱的六位记者，把你们的悲观意念束诸高阁好了！”维氏在答复关于朝鲜问题的询问时指出：联大应该撤消这一议程，因为大会与此问题无关，且与宪章相抵触。此问题应正确实行苏美英三强所负的义务来谋得解决。记者群中又复提出问题称：你以私人从事的战争宣传谴责美政府吗？维氏答称：“我们谈论的是某些国家的反动派，特别是美国的个人、私人机构、私人报纸出版商、资本家、和美国政府的个别代表所从事的战争宣传。”
    【新华社陕北一日电】各方报导：维辛斯基十八日在联大义正词严的演说在美国反动派中所造成的惊愕与紊乱，迄今仍未消失。甚至美官人士亦承认：“维辛斯基的演说，严重地搅乱了美国的舆论”（合众社二十九日电）。据苏联劳动报驻联大记者报导，根据美国报载，美国代表团在此次联大开会之前，曾经长时准备其所谓“攻势”。马歇尔之演说至少改写了五次，最后并由臭名远扬的杜勒斯加以校订。但维辛斯基的一篇演说，破坏了他们的全部把戏。苏联的建议案成了联大与舆论的中心。大独占资本的代表与报纸已被迫不得不以笨拙与无根的否认，来为自己辩护了。该记者透露，美参院外委会主席反动头子范登堡，竟不敢露面，并拒绝参加美代表团工作，“因为他已预先断定，如果参加美国出席联大代表团，将减少他在下次总统竞选中的机会。”
