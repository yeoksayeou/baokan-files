　　【This Dispatch from Taihang, 18th】The masses in Yan's rear in the Taigu Plain have launched a large-scale movement to divide the autumn harvest land. Currently, they have recovered over 15,000 mu of autumn fields and 342 head of livestock. The masses are engaged in the autumn harvest struggle. Under the policy of "The enemy advances, we advance; the enemy does not advance, we still advance; satisfy the local masses' demands for land and food, destroy the rule of the Yan bandits and landlords, and push the autumn harvest land distribution movement to the enemy's rear," each district, after preliminary deliberation, grievance airing, and class division, relying on the poor and hired peasants to conduct investigations, on the 25th of last month, the county's independent regiment and the armed turnaround teams of each district and village, coordinated with the local poor peasants, went deep into the villages along the railway line in the enemy's rear in the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh districts to carry out guerrilla warfare and political offensives, capturing landlords and local bullies to distribute the autumn harvest land. For a time, within the Yan bandits' controlled area of over eighty li east to west, gunshots rang out everywhere, and the Yan bandits panicked and dared not act. The masses in the deeply enemy-controlled areas, who had long hoped for our rescue, were extremely excited and immediately took action, launching a fierce movement to distribute the autumn harvest land and grain and seek revenge. Although the Yan bandits have recently arrested farmers and carried out counter-settlements in a state of panic and fear, the broad masses who have suffered cruel oppression from the Yan bandits and their feudal landlords have realized the truth that "we cannot live without struggle" and have put forward the slogan "Having started the struggle, we must continue the struggle." The masses have successively demanded arms, guns, and landmines, combined with armed turnaround teams, to carry out guerrilla warfare, adhere to the struggle for the distribution of autumn harvest land, and strike at counter-settlement elements.

　　太谷平原阎后农民分秋分田
    【本报太行十八日电】太谷平原阎后群众，掀起了大规模的分秋分田运动，现已收回秋田一万五千余亩，牲口三百四十二头，群众正在进行秋收斗争中。该县在“敌进我进，敌不进我也进，满足当地群众要土地要粮食的要求，摧毁阎匪地主统治，把分秋分田运动，推向敌后”的方针下，各区经过初步的酝酿诉苦划阶级，依托贫雇进行调查后，于上月二十五日，该县独立团及各区村武装翻身队，配合当地贫苦农民，深入四、五、六、七区敌后之铁路沿线村庄，开展游击战争和政治攻势，捕捉地主恶霸，进行分秋分田。一时东西八十余里的阎匪统治区内，枪声四起，阎匪慌作一团，不敢动作，早已热望我们前去解救的深敌区群众却兴奋异常，立即行动起来，掀起了猛烈的分秋分田分粮食复仇运动。阎匪最近虽在张慌恐惧的情况下，大肆逮捕农民，进行倒算，但饱受阎匪及其封建地主残酷压榨的广大群众，已经认识到“不斗争不能活”的道理，提出“已经斗起来，就要斗下去”的口号。群众纷纷要求武装，要枪、要地雷，结合武装翻身队，进行游击运动，坚持分秋分田斗争，打击倒算分子。
