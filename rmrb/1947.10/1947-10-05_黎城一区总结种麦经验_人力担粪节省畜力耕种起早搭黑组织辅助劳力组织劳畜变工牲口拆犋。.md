[Reported by this newspaper from Li Cheng] The wheat planting work in the first district, after an all-out effort, has now been successfully completed. The district is converting over 27,000 mu of wheat land, and has now completely sown it. In particular, it has ensured the early sowing and sufficient fertilization of the land belonging to military families, revolutionary martyrs' families, and those of cadres participating in the southern expeditions. The "169" method has been widely promoted, applying seed soaking and spot sowing techniques. In planting, over 19,000 mu have been completely planted with wide ridges and spot sowing, or with two-legged seed drills, and universal attention has been paid to early sowing. Under the slogan of striving for early planting, the district originally planned to complete wheat planting by September 24th, but in fact, it was completed on the 21st (three days ahead of schedule), and the following experiences were gained: First, save animal power to speed up planting, with human labor carrying manure and animal power plowing. Due to cloudy and foggy weather and flooding, at the beginning of wheat planting, many villages had not finished plowing the wheat fields twice. The fertilizer had not been completely transported to the fields, and the third plowing and planting was imminent. If we still followed the past practice of sweeping up the tail end of the second plowing, transporting fertilizer, and third plowing for planting, relying entirely on livestock, it would be impossible to complete the task. Under these circumstances, each village, after accurate calculation, proposed the slogan of "human labor carrying manure, animal power plowing, saving animal power to speed up planting." The Guihua Gao Tu team, after accounting, found that the team's twenty laborers extracted eight people to specialize in carrying manure, four teams of livestock to specialize in plowing and sowing, and the eight people carried 650 loads of manure in four days. Under the influence of his team, the whole village completed wheat planting three days ahead of schedule. Second, carry out an early start movement, organize auxiliary labor, saving 9,090 workdays. Labor hero Wang Fengqi from Xia Zhuang said: This year's wheat planting has faced rain, floods, and multiple tasks. We must aim for early tightness and later ease, and avoid early looseness and later tightness. Wang Jinming proposed that wheat planting should start early and end late. He himself plowed and planted his three and a half mu of wheat behind the village, which used to take a day and a half to complete, but this year, starting early, he completed the plowing and planting in one day, promoting the village to carry out an early start and late end movement. In organizing auxiliary labor, the district organized 712 children and women to help with planting, saving 9,090 workdays in ten days. For example, Xi Shuiyang organized 75 women to carry out late-stage fertilization and help plant more than 100 mu, freeing up men to specialize in wheat planting, saving 210 male workdays. Women's Rescue Secretary Cheng Jing'e said: Men and women divide labor, freeing up men to plant wheat. Do you think our women are up to it? Third, organizing labor exchange and exchanging animal-drawn farm implements has promoted the movement. Due to the varying amount, strength, and weakness of labor and livestock in different teams, labor and livestock exchange and the sharing of animal-drawn farm implements were carried out during wheat planting. For example, in Xi Wu Village, teams exchanged labor for wheat planting. After labor hero Sun Aiting's team finished planting their own wheat, they helped Hua Shuikuan's team exchange labor for planting, which promoted the whole village to exchange labor for planting 102 mu, and dismantled 19 mules and horses to create 15 more livestock for wheat planting, saving 148 animal workdays.

　　黎城一区总结种麦经验
  　人力担粪节省畜力耕种起早搭黑组织辅助劳力组织劳畜变工牲口拆犋。
    【本报黎城讯】一区的种麦工作，经过全力突击，现已胜利完成，全区正改麦地二万七千余亩，现已完全下种，并已改麦七千六百四十四亩，特别是保证了军烈属南征干部地的早下种与肥饱，并普遍的推广了“一六九”进行了浸种点种技术。在种作上有一万九千余亩，完全是宽垄点种与两条腿耧种的，并普遍的注意了提前下种。全区在早在直麦的口号下，原计划到九月二十四号完成种麦，结果于二十一号（提前三天）已完成了，并获得下列几点经验：一、节省畜力来赶种，人力担粪畜力耕。由于阴雾雨涝，种麦一开始有好多村二犁麦地未耕完，肥没完全运在地里，三犁种麦又迫在眼前，如仍照过去那样扫二犁尾巴运肥三犁种麦，完全由牲口来做，是怎也完不成的，在这种情况下，各村即经过精确计算，提出人力担粪畜力耕，节省畜力来赶种的口号，下桂花高秃组经过算帐，全组二十个劳力，抽出八人专门担粪，四犋牲口专门耕地下种，八人四天担粪六百五十担。在他组影响下，全村提前完成三天种麦。二、开展起早运动，组织辅助劳力，省工九千零九十个。霞庄劳英王逢奇说：今年种麦雨涝生活多，能叫先紧后松，不叫先松后紧。王金明提出种麦要起早搭黑干，他自己寨后种的三亩半麦，过去总是一天半才能耕种完，今年起了个早，连犁带种一天即完了，推动了全村开展了起早搭黑运动。在组织辅助劳力上，全区组织儿童妇女辅助劳力七百一十二人上地帮种，十天节省工九千零九十个。如西水洋组织起妇女七十五人，进行打晚花帮种一百多亩，腾出男人专门种麦，节省男劳力二百一十个。妇救秘书程景娥说：男女劳力大分工，腾出男人把麦种，你看咱妇女中不中。三、组织变工，进行拼犋，推动了运动。由于组与组队与队劳畜力的多寡强弱不一，种麦中进行了劳畜力的变工与牲口的拆犋。如西仵村组与组变工种麦，劳英孙爱廷组种完自己的麦后，即帮助华水宽组变工种，即推动全村变工种麦一百零二亩，并将骡马十九头进行拆犋，多拆出十五头牲口进行种麦，节省畜力一百四十八头。
