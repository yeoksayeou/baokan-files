　　Daming Six Villages Jointly Blocked Breaches and Redirected Water
  　Expanding Wheat Planting Area by Sixty Hectares
    [Our Jinnan Dispatch, 27th] The six villages including Yizhuang in the fifth district of Daming jointly blocked breaches and redirected water, expanding the wheat planting area by more than sixty hectares. Although the villages of Yizhuang, East and West Zhao Village, Wangzha Village, Yanqiao, and Xing Village inside the Daming levee have a small protective dike and have been repaired year after year, the water force is too strong, often causing breaches and disasters. Last year, due to flooding, wheat could not be planted. This year, the river discharged water lightly, and the breach repair project was not large (a total of eight breaches of various sizes, totaling no more than fifty zhang, the larger one being west of Yizhuang Village, 13.5 zhang wide and about three chi deep, and the smallest being no more than three zhang, with water depth mostly more than two chi), after the flood, the masses actively requested to block the breaches and plant wheat. The district then convened a joint meeting of the six villages in Wangzha Village on September 3. After the meeting, each village immediately mobilized to block the breaches, and successively completed eight breach blocking tasks. Currently, except for some water accumulation along the small dike and in individual low-lying areas, most of the submerged land has been exposed, and the masses are actively helping each other to plant wheat, and the expanded wheat planting area has reached more than sixty hectares.

　　大名六村联合堵口顺水
  　扩大种麦地六十顷
    【本报冀南二十七日电】大名五区迤庄等六村联合堵口顺水，扩大种麦面积六十余顷。该区大堤内迤庄、东西赵庄、王乍村、阎桥、邢村等，虽有一道护田小堤，又经年年修补，但水势过大，常溃决成灾。去年因闹水灾，麦子就没有种上。今年大河泄水较轻，同时决口工程不大（共计大小八处，总计不过五十丈，其中较大者在迤庄村西口，宽十三丈五尺，水深三尺许，最小者不过三丈，水深多至二尺余），大水过后，群众即积极要求堵口种麦。该区遂于九月三日假王乍村召开了该六村联席会。会后各村立即动员堵口，先后完成八处堵口任务。现该地除沿小堤及个别洼地尚有积水外，绝大部分淹地已露出地面，群众正积极互助种麦，扩大之种麦面积，已达六十余顷。
