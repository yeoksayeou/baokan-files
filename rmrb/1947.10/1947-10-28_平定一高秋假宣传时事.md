Pingle First High School Autumn Holiday Propaganda on Current Events
[This newspaper dispatch] To combine the current affairs propaganda with the Great Counter-Offensive, the school specifically designated the propaganda of our army's Great Counter-Offensive in various places as the main content of the holiday homework before the holiday. The teachers selected and excerpted the news of the People's Liberation Army's large-scale counter-offensive published in the newspapers and studied it again. Everyone studied enthusiastically and determined the methods of propaganda back home: (1) Master the changing and writing of mass blackboards, (2) Personally go to people's schools to promote current events to the masses, (3) Cooperate with village cadres to do central work, (4) Carry out mealtime and street propaganda anytime and anywhere. More than 80 students from the entire school were divided by region to form autumn holiday propaganda groups. (Yuzhen)

    【本报讯】平定一高为了结合大反攻的时事宣传，学校在放假前，校部专门将宣传我军在各地大反攻，定为假期作业的主要内容，教员将报纸上登的人民解放军大举反攻的消息，选摘出来，又来了一次学习，大家都热情学习，确定了回去宣传的方法：（一）掌握换写大众黑板，（二）亲至民校给群众宣传时事，（三）配合村干部做中心工作，（四）随时随地开展饭场、街头宣传。将全校八十余同学，以地区划分，组成秋假宣传组。（玉珍）
