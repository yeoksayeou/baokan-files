　　Mother Stoyan
    Alexander Dovzhenko Translated by Zhang Zesun
    Who is running through the enemy's corpses, on the burning village street?
    Whose short and tired breathing sounds like a groan? Whose heart is beating so hard it's about to jump out of their chest?
    Who is carrying a Thompson submachine gun and grenades?
    That is Vasily Stoyan—Mother Stoyan’s child.
    But near the burnt ruins of the stove, whose body is hanging in the open air?
    That is Mother Stoyan’s body—the body of Vasily Stoyan’s mother.
    Vasily walked quickly, sweating profusely from the fever of prolonged fighting. He ran, worried and frightened. How he had fought for his own village! It was he who was acting as a guide, and it was his grenade that destroyed the bunker, which used to be his uncle's house. The enemy had transferred and fled, and our people were closely following and chasing.
    Vasily ran all over the village. The houses were still engulfed in flames, the orchards were only piles of burnt rubble; bullet marks covered the ground everywhere, and the enemy corpses lay in their own blood.
    "Mother, where are you? It's me, Vasily! I told you, I will definitely come back again. Poor Ivan has sacrificed, mother, but I am still alive and fighting... I made them pay for Ivan's blood debt, mother, I eliminated more than two hundred of them... But where are you?"
    Vasily turned to the garden in front of the house at the foot of the mountain.
    "Mother! Where are you? Dear, why don't you come out to meet me? Why can't I hear your sweet voice? My dear old mother, where are you?"
    Vasily stopped for a while. The place that used to be his little cottage was gone. He turned to the courtyard, but there was no courtyard; he turned to the orchard, but there was no orchard. Only a knotty pear tree was still alive, and hanging on it was his old mother's body.
    "God!... Alas, if only I had not seen this tragic moment!..."
    One stormy winter night, when Mother Stoyan was still alive, and the cottage was still in its old place of many years, there was a knock on the door. It was long after the evening bell.
    "Who?"
    "Please let us in! We're frozen."
    "But who are you? Where are you from? What country are you from?"
    "We are Russians, friends. Airmen—that's us. Our plane broke down."
    "Oh dear! Come in quickly, I'll bolt the door for you... I hope no one sees you! There are Germans everywhere in the village."
    Two young men limped into the house—both were cripples.
    They had only crossed the threshold when they fell asleep on the floor, as if they had fallen into a bottomless abyss. They slept for a whole day. Mother Stoyan thought they would never wake up.
    She washed their feet with hot water, and then lit a fire in the stove. Three times, when she thought they were about to wake up, she warmed up the meal, but they were still sleeping. As soon as she saw them, recalling her two sons—Ivan and Vasily, tears of grief flowed down her cheeks. Who would give her children something to eat? Who would give them a place to live, or give them some convenience in these terrible and difficult days? Where are they now? Maybe they are already lying stiff and straight on the snow, and the cold wind is blowing their fluffy hair? Maybe they have already been hanged on the gallows somewhere in the German-occupied area, and crows are pecking at their eyes in the ice and snow. No one would pity them, ask who they are, or shed a tear of sympathy! When death has passed through this vast land, what will become of you! My children!
    Shenize and Liabov were both from the Urals. They belonged to the young generation of Russia. They were candid and ordinary children of the Urals, received ordinary education, and worked honestly and actively. They were both members of the Communist Youth League, from the working class, and they volunteered to go to the front line in order to fight the enemy in close combat as soon as possible and drive them out.
    They soon became pilots.
    "At first, we let the Germans experience our excellent heavy bombs for a rather long time, mother, but then we turned to civilized and educational work. We were not flexible enough for this transformation. But we had to do so, this is the order!"
    "What kind of work is this!" One evening, when they were chatting idly in the dark house, Mother Stoyan asked:
    "We often drop leaflets in Ukraine, mother," Shenize explained, "so that the people know the truth about the war."
    "Oh, my children, you are doing such a solemn work!" Mother Stoyan said, "Yes, a truly solemn work. No one in this area knows how things are going. The Germans are trying to fill our minds with some nonsense, which is so disgusting that it seems meaningless to live on, it seems that everything is over, just thinking about it... So, that is your..."
    Therefore, only this time when they were forced to stay in this occupied area and heard Mother Stoyan’s simple words, did Liabov and Shenize truly understand the great mission entrusted to them for the first time. It was in this old cottage, sitting in the darkness behind the closed shutters, as a foil to the blizzard outside and the terrifying rumble of artillery fire in front, that they learned how the people were copying their leaflets by hand, reciting them word by word, and spreading the news from village to village, igniting the fire of hope in the hearts of the people. These words of truth shone like lighthouses in the surrounding darkness, they saved millions of people who were confused by the web of rumors and were so desperate that they hardly dared to plan actions.
    Shenize and Liabov sat in contemplation for a long time, and then they told Mother Stoyan how their plane crashed in the forest one night, how they escaped their lives, but their arms, tendons and heads were injured, how they crawled and stumbled all the way east through dense forests and dark ravines, and how they hid from the Germans in depressions, snowdrifts and valleys. As they narrated their dangerous encounters, even they were amazed at their invincible power to survive.
    "Where is this?" Mother Stoyan asked.
    "Far away, several miles away from here."
    "Long ago?"
    "Yes, more than a month ago. You see, in this time, our bones have been able to grow back in the original broken places." They showed Mother Stoyan the terrible scars that had crippled them.
    "Oh dear! God!" she exclaimed in fright.
    "Don't take it to heart, mother," they said, trying to comfort her, "Soon they will recover, don't worry. We are people who can endure anything, all we need is to rest for a while and regain our strength. After that, we will cross the front line—even if we have to crawl under the snow."
    "I know nothing can stop you. My own children are just like that..."
    For two weeks, this cottage became a comfortable hiding place for the children. Mother Stoyan looked after them, fed them, and acted as their guardian angel. When she took out all her food, she asked for relief from house to house. Although everyone must have been guessing why she was doing this, no one refused her, and no one asked her any questions, because Mother Stoyan's nature was that she would not ask for relief for herself.

　　史托杨妈妈
    亚力山大·多夫钦柯  张则孙译
    是谁穿过敌人的尸骸，在燃烧着的村街上奔跑着？
    是谁的短促而疲乏的喘息听起来好像在呻吟？是谁的心脏跳荡得几乎就要从胸膛里跳出来了。
    是谁背着一枝汤姆枪和手榴弹？
    那是伐西利·史托杨——史托杨老妈妈的孩子。
    但是在灶炉的烧焦了的废墟附近，那是谁的身体在露天下吊着？
    那是史托杨老妈妈的身体——伐西利·史托杨的母亲的身体。
    伐西利急促地走着，由于长期打仗发热而满身大汗。他一面跑，一面忧虑着，惊怕着。他是怎样地为他自己的村庄而战斗的啊！正是他在当着向导，正是他的手榴弹炸毁了那掩蔽部，而这掩蔽部过去曾是他叔叔的房子。敌人已经转移逃窜，而我们的人则紧紧地跟踪追击。
    伐西利跑遍了全村。房子仍旧陷于大火当中，果园只剩了一堆烧焦了的残垣；弹痕布满了地面各处，敌人的尸骸躺在他们自己的血泊中。
    “妈妈，你在那里？这是我，伐西利！我曾告诉你，我一定还要再回来。可怜的伊凡已经牺牲了，妈妈，但我还活着，而且正在斗争着……我叫他们偿还了伊凡的血债，妈妈，我消灭了他们二百多人……但你在那里呢？”
    伐西利转向那山脚下的房子前面的花园。
    “妈妈！你在那里？亲爱的，你为什么不出来迎接我？为什么我不能听见你那甜蜜的声音？我亲爱的老妈妈，你在那里啊？”
    伐西利停了一会儿。过去曾经是他的小茅房的地方，那茅房已经没有了。他转向那个庭院，但那里已经没有庭院；他转向那个果园，但那里已经没有了果园。只有一个有节的梨树还活着，而在那上面吊着的，就是他老母亲的身体。
    “天啊！……唉我，我要是在这里看到这悲惨的一瞬那！……”
    一个暴风雨的冬日的夜里，当史托杨老妈妈还活着，而茅房也还在它那多年以来的老地方，门上传来了敲门的声音。时间已是晚钟以后很久了。
    “谁？”
    “请你让我们进来吧！我们冻坏了。”
    “但你们是谁呢？你们是从那里来的？你们是那一国的？”
    “我们是俄国人，朋友。航空员——这就是我们。我们的飞机跌坏了。”
    “啊唷！进来吧，快些，我给你们闩上门……但愿没有人瞧见你们！村里到处都是德国人。”
    两个年轻人跛着脚进了屋子——两个都是拐子。
    他们才跨进了门槛，就倒在地板上熟睡了，好像是陷入了无底的深渊似的。他们睡了整整一天。史托杨妈妈以为他们是永远不会醒了。
    她用热水给他们洗了脚，然后在火炉上生了火。三次了，当她以为他们要醒来的时候，她热好了饭，但他们却还在继续睡。她一看到他们，回忆到她的两个儿子——伊凡和伐西利，悲痛的热泪就顺着两颊流下。谁会给她的孩子吃一些东西呢？谁会给他们住的地方，或是在这些可怕的困难的日子里给他们一些方便呢？他们现在什么地方？也许他们早已僵硬挺直地躺在那里的雪地上，而寒风却在吹拂着他们的蓬松的头发？也许他们早已吊在德国占领区某处的绞架上，而乌鸦正在冰雪中啄食着他们的眼睛。没有人会在可怜他们，问一下他们是谁，或是一洒同情之泪！当死亡进行过这大块土地的时候，你们究竟怎样了！我的孩子们！
    谢尼泽和李雅波夫都是乌拉尔人。他们属于俄国的年轻的一代。他们是坦白的平凡的乌拉尔的孩子，受过普通教育，诚实而积极工作。他们都是共产青年团团员，出身于劳动阶级，他们是自愿上前线，以便尽可能快地与敌人肉搏，并把它驱逐出去。
    他们很快成了驾驶员。
    “起先，我们让德国人在一个相当长时期中领略着我们精良的重炸弹，妈妈，但随后我们就转变到文明而有教育意义的工作了。对于这种转变，我们是不够灵活的。但我们必须如此做，这是命令！”
    “这是什么样的工作呢！”一个黄昏，当他们在黑漆漆的房子里闲谈的时候，史托杨妈妈问道：
    “我们常常在乌克兰掷下传单妈妈，”谢尼泽解释说：“以便让人民知道战争的真相。”
    “我，我的孩子们，你们是干着多么庄严的工作啊！”史托杨妈妈说：“是的，真正庄严的工作。在这一带没有人知道，世事是怎样了。德国人企图用他们的一些废话，来填塞我们的头脑，这简直是令人嫌恶到似乎活下去都没有意思了，似乎什么都完了，只要想一想……所以，那就是你们的……”
    于是，只有这次当他们被迫停留在这被侵占区，并且听到史托杨妈妈的朴实的话句的时候，李雅波夫和谢尼泽才第一次真正懂得了他们所赋与的伟大使命。这是，在这老旧的茅房里，坐在关了百叶窗后面的黑暗中，作为外面暴风雪和前方可怕的隆隆炮声的陪衬，他们知道了人民是如何用手来抄录他们的传单，一个字一个字地背诵着，并且将这些消息从一个村到一个村地传播出去煽起了人民心中的希望之火。这些直理的字句在周围的黑暗里像灯塔似地闪耀着，他们挽救了千万的人民，这些人民被谣言网所迷惑，绝望到几乎不敢计划行动。
    谢尼泽和李雅波夫坐着凝思了好长时候，然后，他们告诉史托杨妈妈，一夜他们的飞机是如何在森林里撞坏了，他们是如何逃出了他们的生命，但臂膀，筋骨和头却受了伤，他们是如何蠕蠕爬行和跌跌倒倒地一直向东走过了浓密的森林和黑暗的沟壑，他们是如何在洼地里，雪堆里和山谷里躲避着德国人。当他们叙述他们危险的遭遇时，连他们也惊奇自己的那种为了求生的不可征服的力量。
    “这是在什么地方呢？”史托杨妈妈问。
    “很远，离这里有好几哩路。”
    “很久以前了？”
    “是的，一个多月以前。你看，在这个时间里，我们的骨头都已经能在原来折断的地方长起来了。”他们给史托杨妈妈看那使他们成了残废的可怕的伤痕。
    “啊唷！天啊！”她惊怕地叫了起来。
    “不要把它放在心上妈妈”，他们说，尽力安慰她，“不久，它们就将复原的，你别耽心。我们是任何事情都能支持得住的人，我们所需要的，只是休息一个时间，恢复我们的力量。以后，我们就要穿过前线——那怕我们必须要从雪底下爬行过去。”
    “我知道没有东西能阻挡得住你们的。我自己的孩子也正是这样……”
    两星期来，这茅房成了孩子们舒适的隐藏所。史托杨妈妈看护着他们，喂着他们，并且作着他们的护卫天使。当她拿出了，她所有的食物，他又一家一家的要求赈济。虽然大家一定在揣测着她为什么这样做，但没有人拒绝她，没有人问她任何问题，因为，史托杨妈妈的天性是不会为她自己要求赈济的。（未完）
