　　Neihuang, Weihe and Other Counties
    Dredge Waterways and Rush to Plant Mud-Drilled Wheat

    [Reported by our newspaper from the Jiluyu area on the 28th] After Neihuang and Weihe counties drained the waterlogged areas, approximately 150 hectares of land became available, and the masses are rushing to plant mud-drilled wheat. The area originally had the Xiao River (also known as Yongping Canal), running north-south through the borders of the two counties. Over the years, it gradually became silted up. The east bank of the river, along the old Yellow River embankment, was a large depression with deep water, more than one meter deep and as wide as five *li*. The masses in the two counties had conflicting interests and different opinions, which led to serious contradictions among the masses. On August 2nd, Comrade Zhang from the Administrative Office went to assist in resolving the issue, and worked with the cadres of the two counties to survey the river. Both sides resolved to dredge the downstream section of the Xiao River for more than ten *li* north and south of Dianji (Neihuang), and to dig a new ditch 12 *li* long, two *zhang* wide, and one *chi* deep. Work began on October 8th and was completed on the 12th, with a total of 21,300 workdays mobilized (Neihuang accounted for three-quarters, and Weihe for one-quarter). Water was released on the evening of the 12th, and by the next morning, the water level had dropped by more than one *chi*. When the masses saw the water receding so quickly and most of the good land exposed, they were all smiles, happily saying, "Wheat can be planted with mud drills, and it will be sown very quickly." Sun Changyin, director of the Jicun Farmers' Association in the Fifth District of Neihuang, said, "Great, the boil that has plagued us for generations has been lanced!" Because of the river dredging, the problem that had caused lawsuits and fights among ancestors, and had never been resolved, was now solved. Now the masses are busy preparing "mud drills," organizing manpower to rush to plant mud-drilled wheat.

    [Another report] The low-lying area centered on Qijimahu in the Third and Second Districts of Qingfeng and the Fourth District of Guancheng, actively occupies an area of 400-500 hectares of land, with a north-south length of 15 *li* and a water surface width of up to 5 *li*. After inspection by both parties (cadres from Qingfeng, Guancheng, and the Prefectural Office), it was decided to dig a channel from Gongzhuang in Guancheng east to the Dasha River. (Qingfeng, Guancheng) Organized forces from both sides and started work on October 9th and completed it on the 11th, using more than 2,000 workdays, digging 400 *zhang* long, two *zhang* wide, and three *chi* deep. The water receded quickly, dropping half a *chi* overnight. The masses were in high spirits while digging the river, happily saying: "Not only have people turned over, but the land has also turned over. The Eighth Route Army's methods are really good, and we Qijimahu will never forget it!" It is estimated that the land in this depression can be saved, and now the masses are busy planning how to plant mud-drilled wheat, how to organize manpower, and how to prepare mud drills. The enthusiasm for production has been greatly developed, and the truth that "Man will conquer nature" has been recognized by the masses. The First and Tenth Districts of Zhuxian County dug ditches to drain water, saving 180 hectares of fertile land. In the Tenth District, more than 70% of the villages had their land flooded, and most of the autumn crops were submerged. Therefore, the masses were very anxious. After the district party committee called for digging rivers to drain water and expanding the area for wheat planting, the masses in the Tenth District, under the active leadership of the district cadres, completed the water diversion project on the 10th of this month. A ditch seven or eight *li* long was dug from the Liaotang Highway to Shiying, allowing 169 hectares of land to be planted with wheat. The masses are now vigorously helping each other to rush to plant. In Songdikou, First District, more than ten hectares of land were flooded due to heavy rain this year and a breach in the Xiaohou River. After the breach was used to release water, all of it can be sown.

　　内黄卫河等县
    疏水抢种泥耧麦
    【本报冀鲁豫二十八日电】内黄卫河两县疏水后，约有百五十顷地，群众正抢种泥耧麦。该地原有硝河（亦名永平渠），横贯两县境南北，年深日久，渐积淤塞，该河东岸沿黄河旧堤，是积水大洼，水深三尺多，水面宽达五里。两县群众因利害关系不同，彼此意见分歧，酝酿了一个多月，没得到适当解决，致成群众性的严重矛盾。八月二日，有行署张同志前往协助解决，并配合两县干部沿河勘察，双方决议，疏浚硝河下游店集（内黄）南北十余里，挖通新沟渠长十二里、宽两丈、深三尺。十月八号动工，至十二号完成，共计动员用工二万一千三百个（内黄担任四分之三，卫河四分之一），十二号晚放水，次日上午积水就流下一尺多，群众见到水下去这样快，好地大部露出，个个都喜笑颜开，高兴着说：“麦子用泥耧，很快就耩上了。”内黄五区吉村农会主任孙长印说：“好了，我们几辈子的疮出脓了！”因为疏河害得祖辈子打官司拼架，一直未得解决的问题解决了。现群众正忙着准备“泥耧”，组织人力抢种泥耧麦。
    【又息】以清丰三区、二区及观城四区七季马为中心的洼坷，积极约占土地面积四、五百顷，南北十五里长水面宽达五里，经过双方察看（清丰、观城及专署干部），决定于观城弓庄东至大沙河挖通。（清丰、观城）于双方组织力量，于十月九日动工，十一号完成，共用二千余工，挖四百丈长、两丈宽，三尺深，王永很快，一夜水下去半尺。群众在挖河时，兴高采烈，愉快的说：“不只人翻身地也翻身了，八路军办法真正好，咱们七季马一辈子不能忘掉！”估计该坷内的地都能救出来，现群众忙着计划如何耩泥耧麦、如何组织人力、如何预备泥耧，生产情绪高度发扬起来，“人定胜天”这个真理已为群众所认识。筑先县一、十两区挖沟顺水，救出良田一百八十顷。十区百分之七十以上的村，地都被水淹没，秋庄稼大部被淹，因此，群众很着急，在区党委号召，挖河顺水扩大种麦面积之后，十区群众由于区干的积极领导，已于本月十号完成疏水工程，计从聊堂公路到十营挖成七、八里长的一道沟，一百六十九顷地得以种麦。现群众正在大力互助抢种中，一区宋堤口，因今年雨水大，又经小河开口子，淹了十多顷地，经决口放水后，全部都可耩种。
