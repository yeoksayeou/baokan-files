　　Kaocheng Local Armed Forces Conduct Land Reform Education
  　Clarifying That Fighting Is to Protect Land
    [Report from this newspaper, Jilu Yu, 17th] In the guerrilla area of Kaocheng, a certain unit of the local armed corps is carrying out land reform education while "holding a gun in one hand and distributing land in the other." Soldiers have gone from not believing in land reform to actively participating in it, recognizing that fighting is to protect their own land. This has raised the class consciousness of the troops, reduced desertions, and greatly strengthened combat effectiveness. In February of this year, land reform had already been carried out in the Hebei area, but most of the soldiers in a certain unit of the Kaocheng local armed corps in the guerrilla area still did not fully understand it. Some comrades said, "The poor are destined to be like this," while others thought, "Land reform is good, but it can't be implemented here." After Cai Hao, who was hospitalized in Hebei, returned to the team, he told everyone about the land reform he had witnessed in Hebei, and everyone made a partial turn. At this time, the leadership also seized the opportunity to carry out "speaking bitterness" sessions. Wang Xicheng said, "My family farmed the landlord's land for decades. We worked hard, ate pig swill, and worked like oxen. My mother was forcibly taken by the landlord, and my father died of anger. We lived a poor life of hunger and starvation!" Through speaking bitterness, everyone recognized the crimes of the landlords and understood that it was not "destiny." In March, the troops were inserted into the Erqu of Qibin. At this time, Erqu was carrying out land reform and distributing floating wealth, which gave everyone a further understanding of implementing land reform in guerrilla warfare. After the Tianji battle, the environment in Kaocheng temporarily stabilized. With the strong support of the leadership, the morale of the soldiers rose, and they asked, "Can the soldiers take revenge?" At this time, the family of soldier Ma Fa came and said: The puppet property landlord fined and wanted to borrow some money to pay for it. The brigade headquarters immediately pointed out that the puppet property should be returned with double the amount, which made the soldiers even more energetic. When the troops were stationed in Luo'an Village, the village was engaged in distributing floating wealth. The leadership immediately seized the opportunity to educate them. In order to prevent bias, they specifically stipulated that squads and platoons should collect public opinion. If they found ideological problems among the soldiers regarding the implementation of land reform, they would correct them in a timely manner. A young messenger saw a landlord hiding a red packet in a chicken coop and quickly told the masses, who searched out a lot of silverware. The landlord of the Er'er squad's landlord hid two packages in his house. The soldiers told him that he could not hide the landlord's things, so that the masses would not become air-raid shelters, and at the same time, each soldier would not become an air-raid shelter. For the very few "backward" elements, in addition to education, strict discipline was imposed. The groom, Lao Li, lived in his sister's house (a landlord). When the masses were distributing floating wealth, he used a large pot to boil a pot of water, saying it was for the troops, thus covering up. After investigation, in addition to educating him, he was also punished. After land reform and land reform education, the number of desertions of soldiers was greatly reduced. Some family members came to see their children wearing new clothes that had been distributed, talked about the new scenery behind them, and told the soldiers to fight with peace of mind. Sanpai Deputy Xin sent a letter to the instructor saying, "Now I know why I'm doing this. Before, the instructor said to do it for myself, but I didn't understand. Now I believe what the instructor said." He led the guerrillas in the Sanqu of Kaocheng to cover the land reform, and said to the comrades, "We have been allocated land. Can we not beat the enemy in order to protect the land? In the past, I fought to get a gun, but now I know that fighting is also to protect the land." They won many battles. In the land reform education, the class consciousness of the soldiers of this unit was improved, and discipline was very strict, becoming a strong force of the local armed forces.

　　考城地方武装进行土改教育
  　明确打仗为了保田
    【本报冀鲁豫十七日电】游击区考城地方兵团某部，在“一手拿枪，一手分田”中，进行土改教育。战士从不相信土改走向亲自动手，认识到打仗就是为了自己保田，提高了部队的阶级觉悟，减少了逃亡，战斗力大大加强。在今年二月间，河北地区已经进行土改，游击区考城地方兵团某部的战士们，还有大部认识不够，有个别同志说：“穷人是命该如此”，也有人认为“土改就是好，但咱这里也实行不了”。在河北住院的彩号归队后，把河北亲眼见的土改情形说给大家听，大家才转了半个弯子，这时领导上又抓紧了诉苦，王喜成说：“俺家以前种了地主几十年的地，千辛万苦吃猪食出牛力，母亲叫地主强占啦，父亲气死了，过的是忍饥挨饿的穷日子！”经过诉苦使大家认识地主的罪恶，不是“命运如此”。三月间部队插到齐滨二区，这时二区正在进行土改分浮财，这使大家对游击战争中实行土改有了进一步的认识。田集战斗后，考城环境暂时稳定，在领导上大力撑腰下，战士情绪高起来，提出“战士能报仇吗？”这时战士马法家属来说：伪属地主罚款要借些钱去顶。大队部当即指出伪属要加倍送回，这样战士们的劲头更大了。部队住到罗安村时，村上正搞浮财，领导上即抓紧教育，为防止偏向特规定班排搜集群众言论，发现战士中对实行土改的思想毛病，及时纠正，小通讯员看到地主藏到鸡窝里一个红包袱，便赶快告诉群众搜出了很多银器，二二班的房东是个穷人，地主藏到他家两个包袱，战士告诉他不能藏地主东西，使群众不当防空洞，同时每个战士也不当防空洞。对极少数“落后”分子，除教育外，予以严格纪律，马夫老李住到他姐家（地主），在群众搞浮财时，他用大锅烧了一锅水，说是替部队烧的，这样打掩护。经查出除教育他外，还受到处分。经过土改和土改教育后，战士的逃亡大大减少。有些家属都穿着分的新衣服来看自己的子弟，谈谈身后的新光景，叫战士安心作战。三排副馨送信对指导员说：“现在我才知道自己为啥干，以前指导员说为我自己干，我打不通，这会我才相信了指导员的话。”他领导游击队在考城三区掩护土改，对同志们说：“咱分到地啦，为保护土地，打不过敌人能中？过去我打仗是为了得枪，现在才知道打仗也是为了保田。”他们打了很多胜仗，在土改教育中，该部战士阶级觉悟提高，纪律很严明，成了地方武装的一支坚强队伍。
