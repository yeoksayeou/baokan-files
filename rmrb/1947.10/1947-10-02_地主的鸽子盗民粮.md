　　Landlord's Pigeons Steal People's Grain
    Wang Wanquan, a landlord in Baozeyu, Tenth District, Lin County, Jin Sui, had more than 200 mu of land, two large oxen, hired three long-term laborers, and ran a winery and a business.
    From the 20th to the 30th year of the Republic of China, he raised about 1,000 pigeons, feeding them under the eaves of his courtyard. Every year from June to August, when the masses were harvesting summer and autumn crops, the landlord Wang Wanquan would release the pigeons to eat the people's grain. After the pigeons flew back, he would give them lime water to drink. After drinking the lime water, the pigeons would spit out the grain they had eaten. Calculating five qian of grain spit out by each pigeon every day, he could get more than twenty jin per day. For more than ten years, no one knows how much grain the landlord stole from the masses using pigeons! At the same time, each pigeon could also excrete three qian of droppings every day, and the price of pigeon droppings was equal to that of miscellaneous grains. The masses, on the other hand, not only suffered losses in their fields, but also the crops trampled by the large flock of pigeons could not fully mature.
    Landlord Wang Wanquan sent the sorghum stolen by the pigeons to his winery to distill liquor, which he sold to the masses to drink. In this way, without investing any capital, he exploited the masses once again. Don't you think the landlords are shrewd and ruthless?!

　　地主的鸽子盗民粮
    晋绥临县十区堡则峪地主王万全，有二百多亩土地，养着大牛两条，雇着三个长工，并经营着一座酒坊和一个商号。
    民国二十年到三十年，他养了一千只左右的鸽子，喂在他院内的廊檐下，当每年六月到八月，正是群众夏秋收获时，地主王万全就把鸽子放出去让吃老百姓的粮食。鸽子飞回来后，他就给鸽子喝石灰水。鸽子喝了石灰水，就把所吃的粮食吐了出来，每天每个鸽子吐五钱粮食计算，每天即可得二十余斤，十几年来，不知道地主利用鸽子盗了群众多少粮食！同时每个鸽子每天又能拉三钱粪，鸽子粪的价钱等于杂粮。群众呢，不但地里的粮食受损失，而且还被大群鸽子糟踏过的庄稼也就不能完全成熟了。
    地主王万全把鸽子盗回来的高粮送他的酒坊蒸下酒，卖给群众喝，就这样不化本钱，又把群众剥削了一次，你说地主们精不精、狠不狠？！
