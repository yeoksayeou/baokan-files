　　Gang of Foxes and Hounds Argue Without Result
  　Chiang Bandit's "National Assembly" Spurious Election Postponed
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th] According to the Central News Agency, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's "National Assembly" spurious election, which had repeatedly declared "no postponement," was decided on the 26th by the Chiang bandit's "State Council" to be "postponed by one month," that is, the "voting date" was postponed from October 21st-23rd to November 21st-23rd. According to the Associated Press on the 27th, the reason for the postponement of this farcical democratic farce was that the political beggar Youth Party failed to obtain administrative power in certain provinces and a certain number of "National Assembly representatives," and refused to submit a list of spurious National Assembly representatives. Since April of this year, when the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party joined the Chiang government and formally became Chiang Kai-shek's followers, they have only obtained a few "empty ministerial titles." Because they could not change the original team and could not place their gang of foxes and hounds, the Youth Party's thugs who failed to become officials had already quarreled messily at the "Central Executive" meeting secretly held in Shanghai in mid-June, causing Chen Qifu and Zuo Shunsheng to be "extremely distressed" (see Qingdao Da Zhong Daily). And Hu Haimen, the "Government Committee" of the Democratic Socialist Party, also sighed "bored" (Tianjin Yishibao, May 13th). This time, the Chiang bandit's spurious democratic farce needed to rely on these lackeys as supporting roles. The Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party believed they had an opportunity and made demands on the Chiang bandit for several provincial chairmen, committee members, and provincial "senators," and advocated that the number of spurious National Assembly representatives be distributed according to the "one, one, one, two" ratio (that is, the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, and the so-called social elites each occupy one seat, and the Chiang Party occupies two seats—Tianjin Dagong Daily, July 7th), attempting to use hooligan tactics to grab a few more bones. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang also used hooligan tactics to deal with hooligan tactics, saying that they wanted to implement "free elections," meaning that the Kuomintang party hacks would completely monopolize the situation and refuse their lackeys' demands to give up seats and jobs. With the master and servant arguing and no result reached, the National Assembly's spurious election was "postponed."

　　狐群狗党争吵无结果
  　蒋匪“国代”伪选延期
    【新华社陕北廿九日电】据中央社透露，蒋家匪帮一再声明“决不展期”的“国大”伪选，已于二十六日由蒋匪“国务会议”决定“延期一月”，即“投票日期”由十月二十一日至二十三日延至十一月二十一日至二十三日。此一伪装民主丑剧延期原因，据美联社二十七日消息，系由于政治乞丐青年党未能获得某些省的行政权及“国大代表”的一定数目，拒绝提出伪国大代表名单所致。按自本年四月间，民、青两党参加蒋政府正式成为蒋介石跟班后，仅获得几个“部长空衔”。因不能变动原来班底无法安插其狐群狗党，青年党做官不成的喽罗早已于六月中旬在沪秘密召开的“中执”会中吵得一榻糊涂，因此使陈启伏、左舜生“苦恼不堪”（见青岛大中报）。而民社党的“府委”胡海门亦大叹“无聊”（五月十三日天津益世报）。此次蒋匪伪装民主丑剧的伪选，要借重这些奴才当配角，民、青两党认为有机可乘，遂向蒋匪提出若干省府主席、委员、省“参议员”等要求，并主张伪国大代表名额依照“一、一、一、二”比例分配（即民、青两党及所谓社会贤达各占一名、蒋党占两名——七月七日天津大公报），企图以流氓手段多抢几块骨头，蒋家匪帮亦以流氓手段对付流氓手段，说什么要实行“自由选举”，意即由国民党党棍们完全包办，而拒绝其奴才们让出议席和饭碗之要求。主奴争吵尚无结果，国大伪选遂告“延期”。
