　　Several Points of Experience
    [Another Dispatch] The printing factory of this newspaper has gained some experience in this Three Check-Ups campaign, as follows: (1) In the early stage of the Three Check-Ups, the masses' ideological concerns were: what attitude would the leadership take towards the destructive actions of several feudal landlords in the factory? They thought that our factory had always adopted patient education methods such as persuasion and waiting for the mistakes of employees. How would we deal with individual feudal landlords who stubbornly refused to confess? Song Fugen, who let go of his father, a secret agent, had been reflecting on his mistakes for two months but had not revealed the true situation. If resolute measures were taken, would the leadership agree? Therefore, they dared not boldly question him. After the leadership learned of this situation, they immediately explained to everyone that dealing with the destructive events of feudal landlords in the factory could not be done in the same way as dealing with the mistakes of ordinary comrades. Only then did everyone adopt a resolute struggle attitude towards the saboteurs. (2) This Three Check-Ups campaign was conducted separately in each department. After the sabotage element Fu Zihe (landlord) was first investigated and found out in the typesetting department, a typical report was immediately organized to talk about the typesetting department's experience in criticizing Fu Zihe's thinking at the employee congress, in order to promote the inspection in each department and break the attitude of waiting and watching in individual departments. Laborer and peasant activists such as comrades Qiao Fuyuan and Tian Zhongyuan recounted at the congress the facts of their being provoked and oppressed by Fu Zihe. Qiao Fuyuan said: "Once Fu Zihe damaged the screws of the machine, he didn't say a word and put them back in the original place. I only found out it was broken when I moved it later. What kind of thinking is this, pushing the blame onto others?" After the congress, everyone's class consciousness was greatly raised. (3) When investigating Song Fugen in the typesetting department, Wang Ren in the department was a little worried, feeling that there were few people and the work was busy, and wondered if he could be kept. At this time, the leadership, in response to this kind of conciliatory thinking, proposed that for such technical workers with serious crimes, it is better to have none than to have someone who is not good enough. This strengthened the determination of the comrades in charge of the department. (4) When discussing Du Fuyao's mistakes in the machine department, many comrades did not speak, because most of them were machine apprentices and manual laborers, who were usually directed by Du in their work. At the meeting, they were concerned about saving face and unwilling to speak up. Later, a joint struggle was organized, and activists from other departments also came to participate, which broke down the "saving face" barrier. (Wei, Lin)

### 几点经验

　　几点经验
    【又讯】本报印刷厂在这次三查中，获得一些经验如下：（一）在三查初期，群众的思想顾虑是：对几个封建地主破坏工厂的行为，不知领导上采取啥态度？以为我们工厂一向对职工错误采取说服等待等耐心的教育，对个别死不坦白的封建地主，不知如何处理？放走特务父亲的宋福根，对其错误已反省两月，并未谈出真实情况，如用坚决手段，是否领导上同意？所以不敢大胆追问。领导上知道此情形后，即给大家解释，说明处理封建地主破坏工厂的事件，不能和对一般同志的错误采取同一方式，大家才对破坏分子采取了坚决斗争的态度。（二）这次三查是在各部分别进行，首先在打版部清查出破坏分子傅子和（地主）后，即组织典型报告，在职工大会上谈打版部批判傅子和思想经过，以此推动各部门的检查，打破了个别部等待观望的态度。工农积极分子乔福元、田中元等同志在大会上诉说了他们受傅子和的挑拨和欺压的事实，乔福元说：“有一次傅子和损坏了机器螺丝，他不吭声，又按在原来的地方，以后我一动才发现坏了，这种把错误推到别人身上，是什么思想？”经过大会，大大提高了大家的阶级认识。（三）在清查排字部宋福根时，部里王任就有点顾虑，觉得人少工作忙，是否可以留下。这时领导上针对此种姑息思想，提出对这样有严重罪过的技术工人，宁缺勿滥。这样才坚定了部里负责同志的决心。（四）机器部里讨论杜福尧错误时，好多同志不发言，因为大多是机器学徒和劳力工人，平时都受杜指挥工作，开会时爱情面，不愿提。以后组织了联合斗争，其他部门积极分子亦赶来参加，才打开了“情面”障碍。（威、霖）
