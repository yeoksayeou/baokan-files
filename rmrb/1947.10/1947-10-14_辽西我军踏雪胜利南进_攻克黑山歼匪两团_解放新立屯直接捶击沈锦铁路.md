　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 12th. On the tenth, the Northeast Front saw its first snowfall. General Lin Biao's troops, after capturing Zhangwu, advanced south in the rain and snow. One unit captured Black Mountain county town and the important town of Xinlitun (both places are 200 li west of Shenyang) on Double Ten Day. Two regiments (minus one battalion) of Chiang's army's Provisional 57th Division, as well as the 4th Cavalry Brigade and a part of the security forces, were annihilated. Black Mountain is the tenth county town captured by our army in the autumn offensive. The capture of Xinlitun and Black Mountain this time represents another leap forward in the battle situation on the west side of the Beining Railway after our army recovered Faku and Zhangwu. Thus, the Democratic Allied Army not only severed the railway connection between Shenyang and Yixian, but will also directly strike the Shenyang-Jinzhou section of the bandit Chiang's Beining Road with powerful forces, forming a line of operations with our army in the central section of the Beining Road between Jinzhou and Shanhaiguan. The bandit chief Chen Cheng, as our army increasingly closes in on his bandit nest in Shenyang from all sides, still drives miscellaneous troops to their deaths. In the two battles in Zhangwu and Black Mountain, the Provisional 57th Division, reorganized from the puppet security forces, was once again completely annihilated. The 184th Division of Yunnan troops, which had been annihilated twice, fled in panic as soon as they came into contact with our army in the Baqibao and Liuhe East Station (southwest of Xinmin) area, and is now trapped in the northwest town area of ​​Black Mountain in despair.

    【新华社东北前线十二日电】东北前线十日初度飞雪，林彪将军所部大军继克彰武后，于雨雪中向南推进，某部当于双十节日连克打虎山至通辽铁路线上之黑山县城及重镇新立屯（二地均在沈阳以西二百里）。歼蒋军暂五十七师两个团（缺一个营），及骑兵第四旅与保安部队一部。按黑山乃我秋季攻势中攻克之第十座县城。此次新立屯与黑山之攻克，为我军收复法库、彰武后，北宁西侧战局之又一跃进。至此，民主联军不仅剪断沈阳与义县间之铁路连系，而且将更直接的以强大兵力捶击蒋匪北宁路之沈（阳）锦（州）段，并与北宁路中段锦州、山海关间我军形成一线作战。匪首陈诚于我军日益四面逼近其匪巢沈阳时，仍驱使杂牌军送死，此次彰武、黑山一带两次作战中，其由伪保安队改编之暂五十七师又被全部歼灭；两度被歼的云南部队一八四师，则于白旗堡及柳河东站（在新民西南）一带，与我军一经接触，即仓惶逃奔，现已陷于绝望之黑山以西北镇地区。
