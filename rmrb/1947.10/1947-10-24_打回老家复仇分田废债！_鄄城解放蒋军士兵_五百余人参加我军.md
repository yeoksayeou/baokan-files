　　Return to Our Hometowns to Avenge, Divide Land, and Abolish Debts!
  　More Than 500 Liberated Kuomintang Soldiers from Juancheng Join Our Army
    Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Su, Lu, Yu, and An, 22nd: More than 500 soldiers of the 355th Regiment of the 119th Brigade of the 68th Division of the Kuomintang army, who had been liberated for less than half a month during the Battle of Juancheng in western Shandong on the 2nd of this month, held an accusation meeting a few days ago. After exposing Chiang Kai-shek's crimes and recognizing that the People's Liberation Army is the savior of the poor, under the common demands of "Down with Chiang Kai-shek," "Return to our hometowns" (note: most of them are from Henan), "Avenge and wipe out the humiliation," and "Divide land and abolish debts," they unanimously requested to join the People's Liberation Army and immediately set off to the counter-offensive front.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 22nd: In the Jin-Cha-Ji area, the morale of the Chiang Kai-shek-Fu Zuoyi troops is low, and desertions are rampant under our political offensives. A certain unit of the 4th Military Sub-district of Ji-Jin has accommodated more than 70 Kuomintang soldiers who deserted from Shijiazhuang within a week. In the Yanbei area, the 31st Division of Fu Zuoyi's Provisional Third Army has seen more than 30 officers and soldiers desert in the past half month. According to Wang Fake, a soldier of the 6th Division (formerly the Third Army) of the Chiang bandits who escaped from Shijiazhuang, on the evening of August 14th, when the 94th Regiment of the division was transferring from Twenty Li Pu, Zhengding, to the southwest barracks, the 6th Company of the 2nd Battalion alone saw more than 40 people desert in one night. According to soldiers from Fu Zuoyi's main force, the 17th Division, the New 31st Division, and the 101st Division, who escaped to the Chahar-Suiyuan Liberated Area, in August, the 17th Provisional Division of Fu Zuoyi had no fewer than 150 deserters every day. Of the more than 1,200 newly recruited soldiers from Suiyuan and Chahar, only about 400 remain. The 91st Regiment of the New 31st Division originally had a strength of 120 men per company, but due to large-scale desertions, the average strength of each company is now 60 men.
