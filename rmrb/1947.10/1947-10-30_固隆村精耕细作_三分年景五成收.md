　　【Taiyue Dispatch, This Newspaper, 28th】 "Human Power Conquers Heaven." Gulong Village in Yangcheng County, due to intensive farming and drought prevention, achieved a five-tenths harvest in a three-tenths year. This year, there was spring drought and autumn flooding, resulting in a poor harvest. According to general estimates, this year would only yield a three-tenths harvest. However, due to organization, early planting, more weeding, more fertilization, carrying water to plant, watering seedlings, and planting various melons and vegetables, Gulong Village harvested 1355.5 shi and dou of grain from 1800 mu of land, averaging more than 7.5 dou per mu. Wang Jinman's ten mu of millet was planted early, with more fertilizer and good weeding, yielding 19.6 shi, or 1.96 dou per mu, which is 1.21 dou more than the usual yield per mu. Ma Shang's one mu of corn, watered once during the drought, yielded 7 dan, while the unwatered corn only yielded 3 dan. After the rain, following the government's call to plant more melons and vegetables, the whole village replanted north gourds and vegetables in the gaps of the grain fields, bean fields, and stubble fields. The entire village of over one hundred households, in addition to eating for more than two months, each family picked more than 1000 jin of gourds. Wei Duicang's family picked more than 5000 jin, which is equivalent to more than 1700 jin of refined grains. In addition to the harvest of cabbage and radishes, the whole village achieved a five-tenths harvest in a three-tenths year.
