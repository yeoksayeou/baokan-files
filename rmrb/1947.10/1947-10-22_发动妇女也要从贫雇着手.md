　　Mobilizing Women Must Start with the Poor and Hired Laborers
    Liu Di
    In the first half of the year, Nan × Village in Yicheng experienced a period of vigorous movement, but the women, who accounted for half of the village's population, were not mobilized at all. It was not until this reinvestigation that the mobilization of women began. When the reinvestigation movement was launched, the leadership proposed mobilizing women to participate in the struggle at the poor and hired laborers' meeting, but everyone felt that this issue was unimportant. Some said, "A thorn in the hand isn't a door, a wife isn't a person, it doesn't matter whether they're mobilized or not." Others said, "With a father, the son is not prominent; with a husband, the wife is not prominent. If there are men, the women won't stand out." In response to these incorrect ideas, the leadership proposed, "Not mobilizing women is leaving air-raid shelters for the landlords," and asked everyone to discuss it thoroughly. At this time, a member of the Farmers' Association committee realized and said, "Last time I said at the general meeting that the poor in our village hadn't completely turned over, and the landlord Su Guang lived better than the poor, eating white flour, oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar, everything. The landlord's wife heard this and ran to my house to explain to my wife that she ate white flour to entertain guests. When I got home, my wife criticized me for not expressing my opinion of others. Isn't this the landlord using our wives to hold us back? It's true that not mobilizing women leaves air-raid shelters for the landlords." Then the leadership asked whether women had hardships and whether they should turn over. Everyone agreed that women suffered more than men. Each person began to speak on behalf of their wives. A poor peasant said, "Our family can't harvest any grain due to the disaster. My wife eats the thin gruel so I can eat the thick gruel. She suffers even more than I do." Another person said, "We owe the landlord money and can't repay it, forcing us to dare not stay at home. My wife stays at home to resist, enduring their scolding and bullying, so wives should also speak out and turn over." But at this time, someone interjected, "Wives don't know how to do things, they only know how to argue." Immediately, everyone opposed, saying, "Didn't the landlords and rich men also say that we poor fellows didn't know how to do things in the past? But after we turned over, what can't we do? Aren't women the same as men?" After a heated discussion, everyone cleared their minds, and everyone decided to play a model role, first mobilizing their wives, and then promoting other women.
    In the report on mobilizing women among the poor and hired laborers, it was said: "Women suffer a lot, but they have two things in their minds. One is that they think they are useless, and the other is that they think their family is poor and can't afford to miss work. It's enough for men to turn over." According to these reflections, the leadership let the women discuss. As a result of their discussion, they believed that turning over meant improving their lives. It was fine to ask the landlord to return the debts he owed, and everyone was willing to do it. They were afraid of missing work, so they prepared some light work, discussing and working at the same time. Others cannot replace the matter of turning over. In addition, they requested that meetings not interfere with cooking, as late meals would cause children to cry and the elderly to fuss, causing discord in the family. They also requested more small meetings and fewer large meetings. The leadership took care of these special circumstances one by one. In this way, they guided women into the struggle. At the first meeting, everyone was surprised. Why are they all poor people wearing tattered clothes? So everyone traced their poverty back to the roots from these tattered clothes. Some said, "We don't have land and can't grow cotton." Others said, "We only spin thread for others every day, and we can't afford to wear it ourselves." With the leadership's guidance, they realized that the spinning and weaving were all given to the landlords. Our land was taken away by the landlords. From then on, everyone unanimously demanded to speak out and vent their anger. Nine backbone poor women connected with thirty-six women to join the Farmers' Association, promoting all the women in the village to participate in the struggle. At the seven struggle meetings, thirty women spoke out. (Taiyue Branch)

　　发动妇女也要从贫雇着手
    刘迪
    前半年翼城南×村曾经过一段轰轰烈烈的运动，但占其村人口一半的妇女却根本未动，直至此次复查时才开始发动妇女。复查运动一开展，领导上在雇贫会议中提出发动妇女参加斗争，但大家都对此问题感到无关重要。如有的说：“剌手门不算门，老婆家不算人，发动不发动没啥关系。”有的说：“有父不显子，有夫不显妻，有男人就显不着女人了。”领导上针对着这种不正确的思想，提出：“妇女不发动是给地主留防空洞”，让大家好好讨论。这时有个农会常委觉悟了说：“我前次在大会上说咱村穷人没翻透身，地主苏广比穷人活得好，吃的白面油盐酱醋五味俱全。这话叫地主老婆知道了，她就跑到我家里，给我老婆解释说，她吃白面是待客哩。我回家后，老婆批评我不该提人家的意见，这不是地主利用咱老婆拉咱的后腿吗？真是不发动妇女就给地主留下防空洞。”接着领导上又提出妇女是否有苦，应不应翻身，大家都一致认为：妇女所受痛苦比男人还大，你一言他一语就代替自己老婆诉开苦来。有个贫农说：“咱家灾荒打不下一点粮食，老婆吃稀的，让咱吃稠的，比咱还苦。”又有人说：“欠下地主的钱，无力偿还，逼的咱不敢在家停。老婆在家顶挡着，受人家的骂，受人家的欺，所以老婆家是应该一样的诉苦翻身。”但这时有人插了一句：“老婆家不会办事，光会吵。”立刻就被大家反对说：“从前地主老财不是也说咱这穷小子不会办事吗？可是咱翻身后啥不能干？妇女不是和男人一样吗？”大家热烈的讨论后，打通了思想，每个人都决心起模范作用，先发动自己的老婆，然后再推动其他妇女。
    在雇贫发动妇女的汇报中说：“妇女苦是多哩，可是她们脑子里存着在两个问题，一个认为自己不顶事，一个是认为自己家里穷，误不起工，男人闹翻身就行啦。”领导上根据这些反映，让妇女们讨论。她们讨论结果，认为闹翻身就是闹光景，地主欠了咱的债，向他要回来，这事谁也愿办。怕误工，准备些轻便活，开会时一面讨论，一面做活，翻身的事别人代替不了。另外她们要求开会不误做饭，迟了小的哭老的吵，引起家庭不和，并要求多开小会，少开大会，领导上一一照顾了这些特殊情形。这样便引导妇女卷入了斗争。第一次开会时，大家很惊讶。为什么都是咱这穷的穿破衣服的人呢？于是大家就从这破衣服上追起自己的穷根来。有的说：“没地，种不上棉花。”有的说：“咱每天只是给人家纺线，自己穿不上。”再加领导上的诱导，才明白纺花织布都是给了地主。咱的地都是叫地主夺走了。从此，大家一致要求诉苦出气。便以九个雇贫妇女骨干串通了三十六个妇女参加农会，推动了全村妇女参加斗争。七次斗争大会上，即有三十个妇女诉苦。（太岳分社）
