　　Go to the most glorious work post!
　　Village cadres in Yangcheng enthusiastically go south
　　Militia in the Fifth District of Qin County are reviewed and prepared for expedition
　　[Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 2nd] Yangcheng has transferred a large number of cadres to go south, to work in areas north of the Yangtze River. Since the county government decided to transfer cadres from the county's districts and villages to go south, cadres from all districts and villages have signed up, requesting to undertake this glorious task. At a meeting of village cadres in the Fourth District on the 29th, 22 cadres eagerly signed up. Comrade Wu Dexing from the sub-committee said, "This is glorious. When I participated in the war in southern Shanxi, I often thought about returning and wanted to help the masses there to stand up. "He also said, "Many people in our district have already taken up arms and fought across the Yellow River. I have fallen behind, and I want to catch up with them!" Tian Hanzhong, a teacher from the Fourth Senior Primary School, arrived, covered in sweat, and said with a smile, "I'll go, I'll go! I don't have any other burdens, just a package of experience in standing up. I will go south of the Yellow River to help the masses stand up, and I have no other concerns." A district correspondent repeatedly wanted to go, and the district chief allowed it. He immediately went back to tell his parents. His father was very happy, but his mother would not let him go. His father said, "You have a stubborn mind. Haven't you seen how many people have joined the army? Who doesn't have a family? Are you the only one with a family?" His wife, Ruan Xiang, said, "Go ahead. I won't live with my parents anymore. I will stay at home and work hard to produce and take care of my parents!" Bao Manfu, the deputy instructor of Shahe, kept sighing because he was not allowed to go, and said, "I want to go out. If I am not allowed to go this time, I will sign up now and I must go next time!" The district and village cadres who remained behind promised to do a good job and take care of the families of the cadres who went south.
　　[Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 29th] The Fifth District of Qin County organized forces to prepare to participate in the great counter-offensive. On September 10th, it reviewed the militia and civilians in the entire district, totaling 302 people from eight joint villages including Houzhuang, Xikou, Heshanggou, Xinzhuang, Liyu, Guyi, and Beihe. The inspection results showed that Houzhuang and Liyu were the best, with perfect organization and sufficient preparations. The militia of Chaoren Village was the best, with complete uniforms, and each person had shoes, a food bag, a bullet bag, a rice bag, and a grenade bag. In formulating merit plans, Wu Jinsheng, a retired soldier and machine gun shooter, guaranteed that he would kill 12 Chiang bandits in this expedition. Man Sheng, a representative of the militia from Houzhuang Village, proposed that they would capture five Chiang bandits alive in the war mission. Du Qingxiao, a civilian from Xizhuang, automatically changed his business trip number from the fourth to the first, striving to depart first. All villages have successively formulated expedition plans, awaiting departure.
