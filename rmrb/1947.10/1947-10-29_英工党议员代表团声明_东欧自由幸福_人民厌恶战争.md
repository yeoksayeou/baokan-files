Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: London Dispatch: An informal delegation of British Labour Party Members of Parliament, after visiting Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and Poland, returned to London on the 21st and immediately issued a written statement to the press, denouncing "talk of an Iron Curtain as dangerous nonsense." They firmly stated that in these four countries, the people indeed enjoy full freedom, including complete religious freedom. The statement emphasized: "The people of the four countries do not want to see a Third World War again," and in each of these countries, "we did not find any signs of aggression." "The extraordinary progress and construction strength of the four countries deeply impressed us." The delegation finally suggested strengthening the current Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. According to a US News Agency London dispatch, the head of the delegation, Zilliacus, said on the 23rd, regarding his impressions of visiting Eastern Europe: "There is no evidence of preparation for another war anywhere in Eastern Europe." However, the governments and people of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Poland maintain a high degree of vigilance regarding the possibility of the United States launching a Third World War. Zilliacus said that Stalin, when receiving the delegation on the 14th, told them that the Soviet Union is always prepared to improve political and economic relations with all countries, first and foremost with Great Britain and the United States. If these countries are willing to promote relations with the Soviet Union, they will be welcomed. If these countries are unwilling to improve relations with the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union can continue to move forward without their cooperation until these countries regain their rationality and understand the necessity of international cooperation.

　　英工党议员代表团声明
  　东欧自由幸福　人民厌恶战争
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】伦敦讯：英国国会工党议员非正式代表团，于遍访捷、南、苏、波四国后，已于二十一日返抵伦敦，即对报界发表书面声明，指斥“谈论铁幕乃危险的胡说”；并坚称：在此四国中，人民确实享有充分自由，包括宗教之完全自由。声明力称：“四国人民均不愿再睹第三次世界大战”；而在各该国中“我人并未发现任何侵略性之迹象”。“四国之非凡进步与建设力量，使我人深受感动。”该团最后建议增强目前之英苏友好条约。另据美国新闻处伦敦电该团团长齐里亚库斯于二十三日谈访问东欧观感称：“在东欧任何地方均无准备另一次战争之证据”。然苏联及捷、南、波三国官方与人民对美国可能发动第三次世界大战一事，均保有高度警惕。齐氏称：斯大林在十四日接见该团时，曾告该团：苏联始终准备改善与一切国家之政治经济关系，首先即为改善与英美两国之关系，如此等国家愿意促进对苏邦交，必受欢迎，如此等国家不愿改善对苏关系，苏联亦可无需其合作而继续前进，直至此等国家恢复其理性，而了解国际合作之必要时为止。
