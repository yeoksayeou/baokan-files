　　Lincheng County Town
  　Overcomes Complacency
  　Cherishes Turnip Greens
    [Report from our Lincheng correspondent] During the autumn harvest and sowing, the residents of Lincheng County Town discovered large quantities of white turnip greens discarded in the fields and along the roadsides. The base of the city walls was littered with them. A mass meeting was convened on the evening of the 17th to discuss this, focusing on the following issues: Everyone felt busy during the autumn harvest and didn't have time to deal with the turnip greens after planting the white turnips. More specifically, complacency was a factor, with people saying, "We won't even be able to finish eating all the white turnips this year, so why bother with the greens!" Another reason was the lack of jars for pickling vegetables, especially near the county town, where most of the jars had been destroyed during the years of enemy occupation. After everyone recalled and considered the past few months, when even wild vegetables and toon leaves were hard to find, they further realized that this autumn harvest was not guaranteed, and they would still have to rely on vegetables. Although the vegetable harvest was good this year, they could not be complacent and still had to prepare for the spring famine next year. After discussion, it was decided to first distribute the jars stored from the fruits of struggle according to the needs of each household, then find the jars that had been hidden during the previous clearing of the fields. If that was still not enough, they would cook the vegetables in pots and dry them. Everyone would bring back all the turnip greens from their fields to compensate for the poor harvest. (Gen Nan)

　　林县城关
  　克服自满
  　珍惜菜缨
    【本报林县讯】在秋收下种中，林县城关发现了大批白萝卜缨菜，都扔在野地路边，城墙根到处倒的都是，当于十七号晚召开群众大会讨论，主要有以下问题：秋收中都觉得很忙，种了白萝卜，顾不上弄菜缨；特别是自满思想，说：“今年光白萝卜还吃不完哩，菜缨不要吧！”再一个原因是没有缸沤菜，特别是城关附近，在敌人统治下几年来，大部缸被摧毁。经过大家回忆、酝酿，前几个月，采野菜，椿叶还找不到，更认识了今年秋景不行，还得指望菜，今年虽好收菜，也不能自满，还得准备明年春荒。经讨论后，决定先把斗争果实所存的缸，按家里多少，照顾需要，分配下去，再把以前空荒清野所放的缸找出来，再不够用就用锅煮了晒开，各人把地里的菜缨一律拿回来，以补歉收。（根南）
