Mobilize Mutual Aid and Loans to Allocate Livestock and Wheat Seeds
　　Lincheng First District Pays Attention to Solving Difficulties for Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers
　　[Reported by this newspaper] In Mengcun, Yangquan Village, and other places in the first district of Lincheng, in response to the county party committee's call for a concentrated autumn harvest and wheat planting, mutual aid was vigorously launched to expand wheat fields, and manpower and livestock were organized to rush the harvest and cultivation. Many poor people in Mengcun wanted to plant more wheat but lacked wheat seeds. After discussions, they mobilized mutual aid and loans among middle and poor peasants. Zhao Liancheng, a liberated peasant, was the first to say, "The county party committee is calling on us to plant more wheat. This year the fields are full, don't let the lack of wheat seeds prevent us from planting. I will take out one shi of wheat for everyone to plant." Then the chairman of the farmers' association also took out two dou, and fifteen households took out two shi and seven dou of wheat, enabling poor people and military families to plant an additional ninety-eight mu of wheat. The district leaders immediately called on the entire district to launch the Zhao Liancheng movement, mobilizing the masses to widely borrow and aid each other in planting a large amount of wheat. Li Eryin, the political director of Dongguan, seeing that the late crops were not ripe and the wheat on the sandy land had already been planted, with good fields everywhere, decided to take advantage of the time to find wasteland to reclaim. He and four others in his group found a piece of wasteland in the city. They dug with manpower and plowed with livestock, working it eight times in a row, opening up four mu of land, and planted wheat while it was still fertile, hoping for a bumper harvest next year. The cadres of Yangquan Village are getting up early and working late to catch up, striving to plant wheat early. Each cadre leads a group of people to compete in harvesting during the day and transporting manure to the fields and grain to the threshing ground at night. In particular, the public security officer, he and his wife personally pulled the stone roller to thresh the grain, taking out livestock to let the masses plow the land. Under his influence, fourteen people took out their livestock used for threshing and lent them to others for plowing, and many who felt that their work was not important also lent their livestock to households without livestock to speed up plowing.

　　[Reported by this newspaper in Xingtai] At the meeting of village cadres in the fourth district, during the discussion on expanding wheat fields, some village cadres believed that there were no difficulties after the liberation and did not actively help the masses solve problems such as the lack of wheat seeds and farm tools. Some also believed that it was better to plant less wheat well than to plant more. Some proposed: "Take it slow, even goats have to be driven into the mountains!" After discussion, the above ideas were broken down, and a unified method for planting more wheat was determined: late crops such as corn and sorghum can be dug up with the stalks when they are eighty percent ripe, without significantly reducing the harvest, and wheat fields can also be expanded. Intercropping is implemented for late millet, with each household planting one more mu. After specific calculations in each village, Tan Village has 6,500 mu of land and needs to plant 4,500 mu of wheat. Zhao Gu Village, after a practical inspection of the difficulties in planting wheat, found that thirteen poor households lacked wheat seeds, and eleven households lacked wheat seeds. The cooperative solved the problem by lending out 444 jin. After discussion, all villages unanimously agreed to strive to expand wheat fields by 70 percent, harvest more wheat to shorten the famine, vigorously support the front lines, and proposed to strive to plant all wheat fields by the end of the eighth lunar month.

　　发动互剂互借调剂牲畜麦种
  　临城一区注意解决贫雇困难
    【本报讯】临城一区孟村、羊泉村等地，响应县委突击秋收种麦号召，大力展开互剂扩大麦田，组织人畜力赶收赶耕。孟村很多贫苦群众想多种麦没有麦种，经开会商讨，发动中贫农互剂互借，翻身农民赵连成第一个说：“县委号召咱多种麦子，今年地里满垧，别因麦种缺少种了麦子，我拿出一石麦子让大家种”。接着农会主席也拿出二斗，十五户拿出麦子二石七斗，使贫苦群众军属多种麦子九十八亩。区负责同志当即号召全区展开赵连成运动，发动群众广泛互借互剂大量种麦。东关政治主任李二印，看到晚庄稼不熟，沙地麦子已种上，遍地好垧，就决心趁空找荒地开荒，就和本组四人找到城里荒地一块，他们人刨牲口耕，连弄了八过，开出四亩地，趁垧种上麦子，只盼明年一个丰收。羊泉村的干部正起早搭黑向前赶活，争取早种麦，每个干部带一伙群众争先的白天收割，晚上向地里送粪、场里运谷子。特别是公安员，自己和老婆人拉石滚打场，抽出牲口让群众耕地，在他的影响下，十四个群众都把轧场的牲口抽出借给别人耕地，又有许多觉得自己活不要紧的也都把牲口借给无牲口户加紧耕种。（树桐）
    【本报邢台讯】四区村干部会上，在讨论扩大麦田中，有个别村干部，认为翻身后没有什么困难，不主动给群众解决麦种农具困难等问题，还有的认为多种麦不如好好的少种些，有的提出：“慢慢来，有羊都要赶在山里！”经过讨论，打破以上思想，一致定出多种麦办法：晚庄稼玉茭高粱，到八成时候可以连秆刨回，不少收粮食，也能扩大麦田。晚谷实行串种，每户多种一亩。各村具体算帐后，谈村六五○○亩地，要种麦田四五○○亩，赵古庄经过实际检查种麦困难，发现十三户贫苦群众没有麦种，十一户缺麦种，由合作社解决借出四百四十四斤。各村在讨论后，一致要争取扩大麦田百分之七十，多打麦子缩短灾荒，有力支援前线，并提出阴历八月底要争取都种上麦田。（砚良、登柯）
