Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Comprehensive report: The education crisis in primary and secondary schools in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas is deepening, with an increasing number of young people dropping out of school, and those still in school are trapped in the abyss of hunger. According to a report in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, student life in Beiping, known as the "City of Culture," is extremely difficult, and many young male and female students are going to the Peking University Affiliated Hospital to sell blood in order to continue their studies. Very few students at private middle schools are paying their fees after the start of the term. For example, at Yiwenzhong Middle School, out of the original 778 students, only 284 have managed to pay their tuition and attend classes, and two-thirds of the students have been forced to drop out. Tianjin, with a population of more than 1.6 million, has only five dilapidated municipal middle schools. According to a report by a representative of the municipal middle schools at the Chiang Kai-shek municipal government's second anniversary celebration of its recovery, "The current municipal middle schools are not like schools at all, but like beggar's yards. School buildings, books, and equipment are all problematic. The school buildings have no doors, the students have no beds, and there is no food for meals." A representative of the central primary schools also pointed out at the meeting: "There are 210,000 school-age children in Tianjin, but less than one-third are enrolled" (Tianjin Yishibao, this month's 4th). The students in the training class set up by the Chiang Kai-shek Ministry of Education in Jinan often run out of food due to insufficient funds. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, the students had no money to buy meat for the holiday, so they went to the suburbs to hunt wild dogs for food. In Sichuan, known as the "Land of Abundance," the problem of young people dropping out of school is also very serious. When a private middle school enrolled students, only six people applied, and only one actually took the exam. Most schools have held enrollment five times in a row, but still cannot fill their quotas. In Nanyang, only nine students reported to a private middle school one week after the start of classes. In Fujian Province, more than one million children are out of school, and more than four million adults are out of school.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Hebei, 20th. Tianjin Newspaper reports: Facing the severe winter, faculty and staff of universities and colleges in the Northeast Chiang Kai-shek occupied area are without food or clothing, and are suffering from hunger and cold. They sent a telegram calling for improved living conditions, which stated: "Salaries are not enough to buy rice. The Northeast is bitterly cold, and it is difficult enough to eat, let alone get coal for heating and clothes to keep warm. Looking to the future, we cannot help but shudder!" The telegram requested "to follow the example of Beijing and Shanghai last year, and issue each faculty and staff member 1 million (Chiang) circulating coupons for the purchase of leather clothing, and issue two tons of coal per month at no cost." Furthermore, professors at Peking University held a meeting on the 23rd of last month to discuss improving the living conditions of professors, and decided to make two demands: 1. The next adjustment of treatment should be at least no lower than the actual purchasing power obtained during the February adjustment this year, and continue to adjust according to this principle in the future. 2. An additional academic research fee should be issued to full-time professors, based on 5% of the base salary of faculty and staff, and issued monthly according to the local price index.

　　蒋区教育危机日深
  　物价高昂学生被迫失学
  　大学教授职员饥寒交迫
    【新华社陕北二十日电】综合报导：蒋管区中小学校教育危机深重，青年失学者日多，在学青年陷于饥饿深渊。据天津大公报报导，向以“文化城”见称的北平，学生生活困苦万状，不少青年男女学生赴北大附属医院卖血，以继续维持学业。各私立中学开课后交费者寥寥，例如艺文中学原有学生七百七十八人，勉力交足学费上学者仅二百八十四人，三分之二的学生已被迫失学。人口一百六十余万的天津，仅有简陋的市立中学五所，据市中代表在蒋记市府复员两周年纪念会上报告称：“目前市立中学简直不象学校，象个叫化子院。校舍、图书仪器设备均成问题，学舍无门，学生无床，吃饭无菜。”中心小学代表亦在会上指出：“津市学龄儿童二十一万人，就学者不及三分之一”（本月四日津益世报）。蒋记教育部在济南所设立的进修班，因经费不足学生时常断炊，中秋节日学生无钱买肉过节，乃群趋郊外打野狗作菜。向称：“天府之国”的四川，青年失学问题亦至为严重，某私立中学招生时只有六人报名，实际参加考试的仅有一人。大多数学校接连招生五次之多，亦无法招足学额。南阳某私立中学开课一周后，只有学生九人报到。福建全省失学儿童达百余万，成年人失学者愈四百万。
    【新华社冀中二十日电】津报讯：面临严冬之东北蒋占区各大学及专科学校教职员，无食无衣，饥寒交迫，通电呼吁改善生活待遇，原电称：“薪水不足购米之需，东北苦寒，食且惟艰，更何论取暖之煤，御寒之衣。瞻望前途不寒而栗！”该电请求“援去年京沪例，每一教职员发购皮衣费（蒋）流通卷百万元，并按月无价发煤二吨。”又北京大学教授上月二十三日举行会议，讨论改善教授生活事宜，决议提出两项要求：一、下次调整待遇，至少不低于本年二月份调整时所得实质购买力，以后依此原则继续调整。二、加发专任教授学术研究费，以教职员底薪百分之五作基数。每月按当地物价指数加成发给。
