    Linhe Unit One
    Confiscated Landlord's Silver Ingots
    Returned to the Local Masses
    [Our Paper, Taiyue, 22nd Dispatch] Linhe Unit One of the Taiyue Local Corps, in the Fencheng battle, searched out 47 silver ingots, one gold bracelet, some gold and silver jewelry, and five boxes of clothing from Nanjiacun belonging to the fugitive struggle target of Xiawucun, Quwo. After bringing them back, they were immediately handed over to the Xiawucun peasants through the local CPC County Committee. The peasants of the village excitedly said: "This is truly our own army! They shed blood and sweat to retrieve the things the struggle target took, and returned them to us. They are truly the People's Liberation Army who protect the fruits of our liberation!" The grateful masses immediately offered 17 silver ingots as a reward, but the comrades of Unit One declined, saying: "These things are the blood and sweat of the masses extracted by feudal landlords. We are a revolutionary army, an army that protects the thorough liberation of the people, and we absolutely cannot accept them."

    临河部一连
    缴获地主元宝
    送还原地群众
    【本报太岳二十二日电】太岳地方兵团临河部一连，汾城战斗中曾在南贾村搜出曲沃下坞村逃亡斗争对象元宝四十七个，金镯一只，金银首饰一部，衣物五箱。拿回来后，立即通过该县中共县委机关，全部归还下坞村农民。该村农民兴奋的说：“真是咱们的子弟兵！流血流汗搞回斗争对象的东西，还交给咱们，真是保卫群众翻身果实的人民解放军！”感动的群众当即拿出十七个元宝作为酬谢，但一连同志谢绝说：“这些东西是封建地主榨取的群众血汗，我们是革命的队伍，是保卫人民彻底翻身的队伍，我们万万不能要。”
