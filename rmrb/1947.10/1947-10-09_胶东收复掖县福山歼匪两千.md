　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 7th (Urgent Telegram) A unit of the East China People's Liberation Army recovered Yexian city in Jiaodong on the 4th. The defending enemy was completely annihilated, and the results of the battle are being tallied.

　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 7th The Chiang Kai-shek's 25th Division and 54th Division, which invaded north along the Yantai-Qingdao Road to Fushan, continued to suffer heavy blows from our army, with more than 2,000 casualties. One part of the enemy was forcefully blocked by our army at Cishan (fifty-plus li northwest of Fushan city) and Mashan (thirty-plus li west of Fushan city) on September 30th. The enemy launched several attacks, but they were all repelled, with over a thousand killed or wounded. Another part of the enemy, the 198th Brigade of the 54th Division, was also severely attacked by our army at Gongjia and Weiyu (under Haiyang County), seventy-plus li east of Laiyang city, on the 3rd of this month, annihilating nearly a thousand enemies.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 7th The Chiang Kai-shek troops invading Jiaodong are encountering continuous attacks from our army and people everywhere, and they are extremely fearful. Desertion and surrender to our army are increasing daily. According to Li Zhang, a deserter from a company of the 107th Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's 54th Division, four fears are circulating among Chiang's soldiers: "First, they fear that the weather is getting colder and there are no cotton clothes to wear; second, they fear that landmines are exploding everywhere in the liberated areas and they will lose their lives; third, they fear being annihilated if they penetrate deep into the liberated areas; fourth, there are no civilians and no food to eat everywhere." He said, "The civilians have hidden all their belongings, and the people have all run away. Every village is eerily frightening, so the brothers are deserting one after another." According to preliminary investigations, in Pingdu South and Pingdu East counties alone, from September 3rd to September 14th, in the eleven days, more than 400 deserters and prisoners were received and captured.
