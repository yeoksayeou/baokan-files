  　Bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek flies to Beiping
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st] Chiang Kai-shek, the chieftain of the internal war bandits, flew to Beiping again on the 19th. Reuters reported: Chiang will hold a military conference in Ping and may go to Shenyang to continue holding meetings. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Beiping, the Northeast internal war strongholds of the Chiang bandits, Changchun and Jilin, are now completely isolated. The agency described the development of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army's offensive as follows: "The war is moving very quickly from area to area, so that even on a very good map, it is practically impossible to keep track of each one." Chiang's flight to Ping this time shows that it is related to the critical situation of the Chiang bandits in Northeast China caused by the rapid victory of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army.

  　匪首蒋介石飞北平
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】内战匪首蒋介石于十九日又飞北平。路透社称：蒋将在平召开军事会议，并可能前往沈阳继续举行会议。据美联社北平消息，蒋匪东北内战据点长春、吉林现已完全孤立。该社形容东北民主联军攻势发展情形称：“战事逐区移动极迅速，以致即使在标准很好的地图上，实际也不能逐一注意。”蒋贼此次飞平，显示东北民主联军迅速胜利所造成之东北蒋匪此种危急形势有关。
