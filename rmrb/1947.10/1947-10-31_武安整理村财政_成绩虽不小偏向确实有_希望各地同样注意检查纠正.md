To the Editor:

Regarding the issue of village financial rectification in our county, although the achievements are considerable, the inspection of deviations is indeed insufficient. Recently, after reading the opinions of Comrades Xiang Ming and Qing Yu in the newspaper, it aroused our attention. To this end, the county conducted a special inspection when convening a meeting of financial and grain assistants from various districts. According to reports from various districts, out of the 382 administrative villages in the county, 180 villages are self-sufficient, 104 are semi-self-sufficient, and 98 are not self-sufficient. However, many of these self-sufficient villages use the fruits of struggle as a fund, which is even more serious in the new districts. According to statistics, the county's village financial fund is 150 million, of which 30 million comes from the fruits of struggle. Although we have this figure, we cannot completely trust it and should conduct a more thorough and in-depth inspection. Comrade Xiang Ming's opinion is very good and is of great help to the work in Wu'an. We humbly accept it! With best regards.

Wu'an Second Section Office

Editor's Note: Originally, Comrade Xiang Ming wrote an article on the rectification of village finances in Weisushan, Wu'an. He added a few sentences to the end of the article, stating that "two-thirds" of the villages in Wu'an that are moving towards self-sufficiency in production are using the fruits of struggle as a fund. The purpose was to allow the editor to understand the deviations existing in the current financial rectification. In order to attract the attention of all parties, the editor extracted and published it. Recently, we received another letter from Comrade Xiang Ming, explaining that his understanding of "two-thirds" was: "At the Wu'an District Financial and Grain Assistants Conference in early September, according to the report of Meng Fansheng, the financial and grain assistant of the Third District, the 29 villages in the district with production funds in the village public had 4,510,200 yuan, the 28 villages with production funds for the militia had 3,934,200 yuan, and the 22 villages with funds for schools had 1,573,000 yuan, cultivating 506 mu of land, totaling 10,017,400 yuan. Two-thirds of the source is the fruits of struggle, and one-third is the auctioned public property." At that time, we believed that the deviation of using the fruits of struggle as a production fund was worthy of attention. According to letters from all parties, it has been proven that the existence of deviations is indeed true, especially in the new districts. The letters from the Wu'an Office and the Second Section believe that Comrade Xiang Ming's opinion is very good, and they immediately paid attention to the inspection, which is necessary for the future work of financial rectification. We hope that all localities will also pay attention to checking and correcting any similar situations.

　　武安整理村财政
  　成绩虽不小偏向确实有
    希望各地同样注意检查纠正编辑同志：
    关于我县的整理村财政问题，虽然成绩不小，但对偏向确实是检查的不够，最近在报纸上看到向明同志和庆余同志的意见以后，引起了我们的重视，为此县里在召开各区财粮助理员会时，专门作了检查，根据各区的汇报，全县三百八十二个行政村，自供自给的村有一百八十个，半自供自给的一百零四个，不能自供自给的九十八个，但是这自供自给的村，还有不少的村子是用斗争果实作基金，新区更为严重，据统计全县村财政基金一万五千万，而斗争果实占三千万，虽然有这个数目字。但是我们还不能完全相信，还应该再认真的去深入检查，向明同志提的意见是很好的，是对武安工作有很大帮助，我们虚心的接受！即致敬

    编者按：原来向明同志写了一篇武安魏粟山整理村财政一稿，在稿后附带了几句，说明武安村财政走向生产自给的村有“三分之二”是用斗争果实作基金，其目的是让编者了解目前整财中存在的偏向。编者为引起各方注意起见，将其摘出刊登。最近又接向明同志来信，说明对“三分之二”的了解是：“九月初在武安各区财粮助理员会议上听的报告，据三区财粮助理员孟繁生同志汇报，该区村公所有生产基金的二十九个村四、五一○、二○○元，民兵有生产基金的二十八个村三、九三四、二○○元，学校有基金的二十二个村一、五七三、○○○元，种地五○六亩，以上合计一○、○一七、四○○元，其来源三分之二是斗争果实，三分之一是拍卖的公产。”当时我们认为用斗争果实充作生产基金的偏向是值得注意的，现据各方来信，都已证明偏向的存在是确实的，尤其在新区是更为严重。武安办公室和二科来信，对向明同志的意见认为很好，而且即注意检查，这对今后整财工作都是必要的。我们希望各地也同样注意检查一下，如有类似情形，也应注意加以纠正。
