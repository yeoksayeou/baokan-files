To the Editor:

　　We often see the term "Chiang Kai-shek's 'Five Main Forces'" in the newspapers. We only know that one of them is the reorganized 74th Division, which was annihilated by our army in the Menglianggu campaign in Mengyin in mid-May. What are the other four unit numbers? What is their actual combat effectiveness? We hope to know. Can you answer this?

　　Changzhi, Ge Nan, Ming Xin

Comrades Ge Nan and Ming Xin:

　　Due to the reactionary nature of the Chiang army, none of its units has strong combat effectiveness. The first condition for being called a "main force" is being particularly trusted by Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, he is willing to equip these units with as much American weaponry as possible. These units can also receive more and faster replenishment than other units when they suffer losses in combat. That is why they can still be called a "main force." This "main force" is not really that amazing. The reorganized 74th Division, originally a Nanjing garrison unit, was completely wiped out by our army in the Menglianggu campaign. That is the best proof. The other four of the so-called "Five Main Forces" have also suffered serious blows from our army:

　　(1) Reorganized 11th Division: Originally the 18th Army, it was cultivated by Chen Cheng. The army commanders were Luo Zhuoying, Peng Shan, Fang Tian, Luo Guangwen, etc. In March 1945, it was fully equipped with American weaponry, and the treatment of officers and soldiers far exceeded that of other units. Because it constantly annexed other units, its vacancies were not as large as those of other units, and there were more veteran soldiers. The current division commander is Hu Lian (from Huaxian, Shaanxi). It has three brigades under its command: the 11th, 18th, and 118th, among which the 11th Brigade has stronger combat effectiveness. In October last year, its 32nd Regiment also suffered a devastating blow from our army in the Longfeng campaign in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area. After Chiang Kai-shek suffered repeated defeats in Jiangsu and Anhui, it was hastily transferred to northern Jiangsu in December last year. In the large-scale encirclement battle northeast of Suqian, its 11th and 18th Brigades were each partially annihilated by us. When Chiang Kai-shek deployed a key offensive to invade southern Shandong in February this year, he replenished it and used it as the left wing. In August, it suffered heavy firepower in the Nanma blocking battle in central Shandong, with more than 5,000 casualties. Later, our counter-offensive army went south, and it was completely passively transferred to western Shandong and is now hesitating on the Longhai Railway line.

　　(2) Reorganized 5th Division (i.e., 5th Army, renamed division in May this year): It was Chiang Kai-shek's earliest mechanized unit. Its predecessor was the "Army Armored Corps," established in May 1937, with Du Yuming as the major general commander. In 1939, its designation was changed to the 5th Army, and Du was promoted to army commander. In 1942, it was reorganized and equipped with American weaponry in ＠明. In the winter of 1945, Chiang Kai-shek eliminated the Yunnan local forces of Long Yun, which was done by this unit. After Du Yuming was transferred to the Northeast, he took away the affiliated armored corps and motor vehicle corps, so it is no longer a mechanized corps, and its combat effectiveness is not very strong. It now belongs to Wang Jingjiu's group, and the division commander is Qiu Qingquan (from Fujian, a German student, proud and boastful, people call him Qiu the Madman.) It has three brigades under its command: the 200th, 96th, and 45th, among which only the 200th Brigade is still relatively capable. In September last year, when it invaded western Shandong, it was severely attacked by us in Longdongji on the Heze-Ju Highway. Hu Changqing, the commander of the 45th Division, was killed, and more than 5,000 people were lost. In December last year, Chiang Kai-shek vainly attempted to open the Pinghan Railway, and the army fled west to the Qingfeng and Nanle areas. When our army went south to the Longhai Railway for the second time, it was hurriedly transferred south. In February this year, it fled to Dawenkou in central Shandong. In April, it ventured to invade Laiwu. After we captured Tai'an and annihilated the enemy's 72nd Division, the enemy's transportation line was greatly threatened, and it had to rush back. In July, our army's major victory in southern Shandong forced it to march urgently for eight days to aid western Shandong, but before it reached western Shandong, it was annihilated by us for over 1,000 men on the side of the Jinpu Railway. In August and September, it was annihilated for over 3,000 men by our Chen and Su armies in western Shandong. Now it is still wandering in the area south of Yuncheng, dragging on and being beaten everywhere, running around.

　　(3) New 1st Army (unreorganized): It was Chiang Kai-shek's earliest American-equipped unit, had been trained by the US for a longer time, and was highly valued by Chiang and the US. The army commander was originally Sun Liren, and is now Pan Yu＠. It belongs to the Second Corps of Chen Cheng of the Northeast Headquarters, Chen Mingren's unit, and has under its command the 50th Division, the New 30th Division, and the New 38th Division. In February last year, it was transported by US ships from Kowloon to Qingdao, and then to the Northeast. It suffered heavy losses in our army's summer offensive in the Northeast and is still trapped in the Changchun, Jilin, and Siping areas. Recently, its 150th Regiment of the 50th Division attacked from Siping and was completely annihilated by us.

　　(4) New 6th Army (unreorganized): Like the New 1st Army, it was one of the earliest bandit armies to receive American equipment and American training, and was most favored by the US and Chiang. The food was better than that of ordinary Chiang bandit troops. In August 1944, many American devils participated in the work of this unit, led by Colonel Phillips, the chief liaison officer. At that time, there were American officers and soldiers of all levels in the New 6th Army. The army commander was formerly Liao Yaoxiang (from Baoqing, Hunan; had apprenticed in the German fascist army around the time Hitler came to power), and is now Li Tao. It has under its command the 14th Division, the 207th Division, and the New 22nd Division; it belongs to the Fourth Corps (Commander-in-Chief Liao Yaoxiang) under the Chiang bandit Northeast Headquarters. In September of the year before last, after the Japanese devils surrendered, it was airlifted by American imperialists from Zhijiang to Nanjing to "accept the surrender." In January last year, it was airlifted by American planes from Shanghai to Qinhuangdao and transferred to the Northeast to fight the civil war. After invading the Northeast, in the battles of Benxi, Fushun, and Siping last year, the four counter-attacks in the Linjiang area this year, and the summer offensive, it was constantly taught by the iron fist of our Democratic Allied Army. Three regiments have been annihilated by us and has become a shrinking army that can only be trapped in isolated cities. It is now trapped in the Shenyang-Tieling area.

　　Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "Five Main Forces" are just so-so. One of them has already been finished, and the other four are also incomplete and in a state of extreme embarrassment. They will eventually be completely and thoroughly annihilated by our army.

### 蒋介石的所谓“五大主力”

　　蒋介石的所谓“五大主力”编辑同志：
    在报纸上常看到蒋介石“五大主力”字样，我们只知道其中之一是五月中旬在蒙阴孟良崮被我军歼灭的整七十四师，其余四个番号是什么？战斗力究竟如何？我们希望知道，可不可以解答一下？
    长治葛南、铭新葛南、铭新同志：
    由于蒋军的反动本质，它没有一个部队是有坚强的战斗力的。所谓“主力”，它所具备的第一个条件乃是为蒋介石所特别亲信，因此才肯把美国给他的军械尽量装备这些部队，这些部队在作战中受到损失也能比别的部队得到较多较快的补充；所以还能被称为“主力”。这“主力”决不是怎么了不起的，原为南京卫戍部队的整七十四师被我军在孟良崮一次战役就打得全军覆没，就是最好的证明。所谓“五大主力”中的其他四个，也都经受过我军的严重打击：
    （一）整编第十一师：原为第十八军，是陈诚一手培植起来的，历任军长为罗卓英、彭善、方天、罗广文等。四五年三月全部装备美械，官兵待遇远超过其他部队，因为不断吞并其他部队，所以缺额还不象别的部队大，老兵也较多一些。现任师长为胡琏（陕西华县人），下辖十一、十八、一一八等三个旅，其中以十一旅战斗力较强，而在去年十月在冀鲁豫龙凤战役中其三十二团也遭到了我军的歼灭性打击。后蒋介石在苏皖连吃败仗，于去年十二月被匆匆调到苏北。在宿迁东北的大围歼战中，其十一、十八两旅又各被我歼灭一部。今年二月蒋介石布置重点攻势进犯鲁南时，把它补充了一下，充当左翼。八月在鲁中南麻阻击战中又遭我强烈火力打击，死伤五千余。以后我反攻大军南下，又完全被动地调到鲁西，现正踟蹰于陇海线上。
    （二）整编第五师（即第五军，今年五月改师）：是蒋介石最早的机械化部队，前身为“陆军装甲兵团”，成立于一九三七年五月，以杜聿明任少将团长。三九年改番号为第五军，杜升军长。四二年在＠明整训装备美械。四五年冬蒋介石消灭云南地方势力龙云部，就是这个部队干的。杜聿明调东北后，把所属的装甲兵团、汽车兵团都带走了，它已不成为机械化兵团，战斗力并不怎样强。现在属王敬久集团，师长为邱清泉，（福建人，德国留学生，骄傲好吹，人家称他邱疯子。）辖二○○、九十六、四十五等三个旅，其中只二○○旅还比较能打。去年九月进犯鲁西，在菏巨公路上龙垌集遭我痛击，四十五师师长胡长清被击毙，损失五千多人。去年十二月，蒋介石妄想打通平汉路，该军又西窜清丰、南乐一带。当我大军第二次南下陇海路时，它又仓惶南调，今年二月又窜向鲁中大汶口，四月冒险进犯莱芜，我克泰安歼敌第七十二师后敌运输线大受威胁，它又不得不赶快回窜。七月我军南下鲁西大捷，它又被调以八天的急行军驰援鲁西，还没到鲁西就在津浦路侧被我歼灭千余。八、九月间在鲁西又被我陈粟大军歼灭三千多人。现在它还徘徊在郓城以南地区，拖来拖去，到处挨打，疲于奔命。
    （三）新一军（未经整编）：是蒋介石最早的美械化部队，受美方训练时间较长，极受蒋美重视。军长原为孙立人，现为潘裕＠，属东北行辕（陈诚）之第二兵团陈明仁部，下辖五十师、新三十师、新三十八师。去年二月从九龙由美舰海运至青岛，转至东北，在东北我军夏季攻势中迭受重创，现仍困踞长春、吉林、四平一带。最近其五十师一五○团由四平出犯，被我全歼。
    （四）新六军（未经整编）：与新一军同为最早受美国装备美国训练的匪军，也最受美蒋宠爱，伙食比一般蒋匪军好。一九四四年八月就有很多美国鬼子参加这个部队工作，以总联络官费利浦斯上校为首。那时新六军中，各级的美国官兵都有。军长过去是廖耀湘（湖南宝庆人；希特勒登台前后，在德国法西斯军队中见习过），现为李涛，下辖十四师、二○七师及新二十二师；属于蒋匪东北行辕下第四兵团（廖耀湘总指挥）。前年九月日寇投降后，为美帝国主义者由芷江空运到南京“受降”，于去年一月又由上海用美机空运到秦皇岛，转到东北打内战。侵入东北后，在去年的本溪、抚顺、四平诸役，今年四次临江地区反击战及夏季攻势中，不断受到我民主联军铁拳的教训，已有三个团被我歼灭，成为只能困守孤城的缩头军了。现困踞沈阳铁岭一带。
    所谓蒋介石的“五大主力”，也不过这么松。其中一个早已完蛋，别的四个也都残缺不全狼狈不堪了，终必会被我军干净彻底歼灭的。
