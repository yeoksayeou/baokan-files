　　Some Bad Village Cadres in Daming
　　Obstruct the Poor and Hired Peasants from Taking Power

　　[Our newspaper, Jinnan, 16th dispatch] In Daming and other places, in the process of establishing the leadership of the poor and hired peasants, resistance and obstacles are constantly encountered. The village cadres in Jiucheng Village, Third District, are of very bad composition. When they heard that the poor peasant groups could take power, they organized fake poor peasant groups to deceive their superiors and cope with the masses. Most of those they organized were bad elements above the middle peasant level, and people who thought the same way as them. The village head appointed all the group leaders. At the group leader meetings, the village head openly said: This time it is a "struggle session." If you have any opinions about the households in our village that are being struggled against, big opinions should be turned into small opinions, and small opinions should be turned into no opinions. When the leadership discovered this, they disbanded the groups and removed several village cadres from their posts. Zhao Xigao and Zhao Yuxiang, the chairman and member of the Farmer's Association in Zhao Village, Fourth District of Wucheng, protected local landlords last year and also embezzled many fruits from the masses. This time, during the review and establishment of the backbone leadership of poor peasants, they were very surprised when poor peasants were linked up and organized. They were afraid that the poor peasants would settle accounts with them, so they began to organize middle peasants and win over rich peasants and bankrupt landlords to attack the poor peasants. When the poor peasants went to meetings at night, Zhao Xigao and others used loudspeakers to announce a curfew, shouting, "Whoever comes out will die for nothing." They also stood guard to control the activities of the poor peasants. Later, with the district firmly supporting the poor peasants, the middle peasants who had been organized by bad elements gradually disintegrated. Wu Weicheng, a village cadre sitting in Daming Third District, did not conduct thorough investigations and allowed Xing Zhenya, a bad element who had been a traitor, to connect with the poor peasants and organize "poor peasant groups." As a result, he connected with more than ten people, including a landlord's wife. Xing also adopted the tone of the village cadre and said that the activist militia captain was a bad egg and had him detained. As a result, the masses did not attend meetings or speak. Later, he detained nine group leaders of the Farmers' Association. The masses could not bear it any longer and detained Xing Zhenya. Only then did the village cadre realize that he had been tricked.

　　大名有些坏村干
  　阻碍贫雇当家
    【本报冀南十六日电】大名等地在树立贫雇领导中，不断遇到抵抗和障碍，三区旧城村干成份很坏，他们听说贫农小组能掌权，就组织假贫农小组，瞒了上级，应付群众。他们组织的多是中农以上的坏蛋，和他们一鼻孔出气的人，各组长全由村长指定，组长会上，村长公开的说：这次是“武斗”，您对咱村被斗户提意见，大意见要变成小意见，小意见要变成没意见。领导上发觉解散，将几个村干撤职。武城四区赵庄农会主任赵希皋和赵玉祥，去年他们掩护本族地主，还贪污群众很多果实。这次复查，树立贫农领导骨干，以贫农串连组织，他们很吃惊，恐怕贫农和他算帐，也就开始组织中农，拉拢富农和破落地主，来进攻贫农。晚上贫农去开会时，赵希皋等就用喇叭筒广播戒严，喊着：“谁要出来打死白死。”并站岗控制贫农的活动。后经区坚决予贫农撑腰作主，被坏分子利用而组织的中农，就慢慢的分化了。大名三区吴未城坐村干部，不深入调查，让过去当过汉奸的坏分子邢振雅去串连贫农，组织“贫农小组”，结果串连了十多个人，其中还有地主妇女，邢并讨了坐村干部的口气，说积极分子民兵队长是坏蛋，给扣起来，于是群众开会也不到会，也不发言了。以后，又扣起农会九个小组长，群众实忍不住了，群起将邢振雅扣起。坐村干部才恍悟了自己是上了当。
