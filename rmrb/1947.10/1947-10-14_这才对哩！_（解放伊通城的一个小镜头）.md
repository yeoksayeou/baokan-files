　　"That's Right!"
    (A brief glimpse of the liberation of Yitong City)
    Liu Zhentang, Wang Ying
    Even before the gunfire had ceased, residents were already running into the streets. A child of about ten years old was automatically taking an ash basin to scrub the reactionary slogans off the walls, getting his small hands completely black. As prisoners of war were marched through the street, people pointed and said, "These guys were oppressing us just yesterday; the Eighth Route Army has finally avenged us today!" Merchants said, "If these bad elements aren't driven away, we won't be able to escape the 'Mid-Autumn Festival tax' again."
    The liberated people immediately poured out their grievances to the Democratic Allied Army, saying, "It's unbearable! These 'calamity troops' have made a mess of things. Feeding a pig requires a tax of seven thousand yuan!" When a propaganda worker from our unit was about to paint over a reactionary slogan, a resident in his forties immediately brought out a basin of black ash and handed it to him, saying with resentment, "Look at what those guys wrote on the wall! You change it!" After the propaganda worker changed the reactionary slogan to "Settle accounts with traitors and local tyrants," the onlookers happily said, "That's right!"

　　“这才对哩！”
    （解放伊通城的一个小镜头）
    刘振堂　王英
    枪声还没有停止，居民都跑到街上来了，一个十来岁的孩子，自动拿着烟灰盆洗刷墙上的反动标语，把两只小手弄得漆黑，街上走过俘虏时，人们都指手划脚的说：“这群家伙在昨天还压迫我们，今天八路军总算给我们出气了”，商人们说：“要不把这些坏东西打跑，我们‘中秋税’又免不了”。
    被解放的人民一看到民主联军就诉苦说：“过不得，叫这些‘遭殃军’闹得不象样了，喂一口猪就得要七千元的税。”我某部一个宣传员正想涂改反动标语时，一个四十多岁的居民已端出一盆黑灰来递给他，愤恨地说：“你看那些家伙在墙上写些啥，你改吧！”待宣传员把这条反动标语改成“清算汉奸恶霸”，旁观的群众都高兴的说：“这才对哩！”
