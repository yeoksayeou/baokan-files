　　Three Friends (Conclusion)
　　Wei Junyi
　　Afterward, I went to see Luo Ping again. But, after spending a long time with Liu Jinkuan, I found that those foreigners and love entanglements seemed distant. At the same time, his grinning and casual mannerisms once again aroused my aversion. Whether I had difficulties at work or problems in life, I preferred to discuss them with Liu Jinkuan. Because Liu Jinkuan could really help me solve them, while talking to Luo Ping was too circuitous. Whenever I was with Lao Liu, I felt that my eyes brightened and my courage returned. I once used him as my backing and vented my frustration in front of that landlord friend.
　　Now it's time to talk about that landlord friend, who was Liu Jinkuan's master, Fourth Master Huang, named Huang Zonggu. His home was in Liu Family Village. I met him when I was previously attending the city's assembly. To be honest, in the past, I was always a bit apprehensive when I saw him, because that guy had a famous temper and loved to test people. No matter which staff member saw him, he would always bring out his whole set of knowledge. Things like the Zuo Zhuan and Tang poetry, making many cadres in the county afraid to see him. Those old men had organized a poetry society, and the county called them the "cultural circles." Luckily, my parents sent me to school for those few years, so I could barely manage to answer them. Huang Zonggu deliberately treated me as a confidant, and whenever we met, he would say "we scholars," "us people," show me the poems he had written, insisted that I criticize them, and even wanted me to write a few in response. You know, my old learning was just a few Chinese textbooks and a few poems I flipped through for fun. Naturally, I was afraid of exposing my ignorance in front of him, and every time I met him, I was worried that he would laugh at me. Originally, not to mention that communist ideology and Huang Zonggu were completely unrelated, even my ten years of capitalist education made it difficult for me to approach this set of examination-style poetry elegance. But the comrades in the county all said, "Thanks to Lao Wu for saving us face, otherwise our united front work would be embarrassing." This made me vaguely feel that others couldn't get close to them, but only I could, and that we could talk to each other and be called friends, which was an ability. I once felt secretly proud of this.
　　This time when I arrived at Liu Family Village, I naturally knew that I was there to do grassroots work and should spend more time with the farmers and less time approaching the landlords. However, I also felt that, for example, a street performer, when arriving at a dock, should always first visit the important figures of the area so that the scene can be held up. Therefore, I still went to see Huang Zonggu and received his very warm hospitality. It wasn't until I became friends with Liu Jinkuan and the others that I began to realize that this Huang Zonggu was a two-faced person, showing one face to our county cadres and another face to Liu Jinkuan and the others. Only when I ran into him on the road in the village, everyone was still very polite. He would always have some newly blossoming peach blossoms to invite me to admire and write about, still like a good friend. As usual, whenever I heard him talk about poetry and essays, I would still feel a little uneasy.
　　This continued until the county launched the rent reduction campaign, requiring landlords to return the rent they had collected in excess last autumn. Liu Jinkuan was the leader of the Liu Family Village rent reduction association, leading the tenants with sacks and bags to Huang Zonggu's house. That afternoon, when I rushed to Huang's house, his courtyard, more than fifty steps wide and paved with bluestone slabs, was already full of farmers. Even the brick flowerbeds were occupied by people squatting. The noisy voices could be heard even in the street. From the main gate all the way to the third gate were open. Exceptionally, there were no vicious dogs barking, and no old maids welcoming guests. I quietly sneaked in and saw Huang Zonggu standing on the central steps, still holding his three-foot-five white copper opium pipe. But his thin yellow face was as swollen as his purple copper silk robe, red within purple, and bright within purple. I saw him open his mouth and make "ah, ah" sounds a few times, unable to say anything further, which I found very amusing. I wanted to hide behind people and watch him for a while, but before I could settle down, he had already seen me. His narrow eyes immediately lit up, as if he had found a savior. He took three steps and two steps to walk down the steps and rushed to me, shouting repeatedly, "Lao Wu, Lao Wu! Comrade Lao Wu!" While shouting, he came to shake my hand. At that time, I had no way to retreat, so I had to nod and squeeze out from behind the people. The farmers in the yard suddenly saw this scene and stared at me and him with wide eyes. Everyone stopped making noise. The yard was suddenly quiet, and everyone slowly moved to both sides. Huang Zonggu's face was full of strange smiles, leading me to walk along the veranda, loudly shouting toward the main room, the side room, and all corners of the courtyard: "Zhang Ma! Chunzi! Zhang Ma! We have a guest! Pour tea!" Immediately, the yard was filled with his voice. Turning back, he said to me with a beaming face, "Please come in! Please come in! I have something I want you to correct! We haven't had a chat for a long time..." As he spoke and smiled, it was as if he had suddenly completely forgotten that there were these farmers in the yard. --How could I not see those more than a hundred pairs of familiar eyes? I knew very well that they were all whispering about me! --Liu Jinkuan was standing at the entrance of the steps. When he saw me approaching, he called out, "Lao Wu!" As soon as I responded, Huang Zonggu personally lifted the felt door curtain of the main room and repeatedly called "Lao Wu, Lao Wu!" He insisted on letting me sit in the room. When I didn't go in, he personally carried a stool out and placed it on the veranda, casually saying to me, "Outsiders don't know, but you understand, Lao Wu! I have always been lazy and don't care about family affairs, haha! I don't like asking about fields and houses. The people in my family are also really confused and don't understand the law, haha! You and I are close friends, so you will naturally forgive me..." I was both angry and annoyed. His adoption of this attitude was simply deliberately undermining me. I waved my hand to tell him to stop, but he was so eloquent, as if he was reciting lines from a script, that I didn't even have a chance to interrupt. --Luckily, Liu Jinkuan helped me out of the predicament!
　　While Huang Zonggu was speaking, Liu Jinkuan, who was standing at the entrance of the steps, suddenly stepped forward and solemnly called me again, "Lao Wu! What did we come here for?" I shuddered, my face flushed, and quickly stamped my foot and stood up from Huang Zonggu's stool. Oh dear! Liu Jinkai, Wang Xiangru, and eight or nine others standing in front of the steps rushed onto the veranda. The crowd in the center of the yard moved chaotically. People in the middle shouted, "We're hungry!" "Don't be sentimental!" ... Many children also squeezed in through people's legs, shouting "Check the grain!" "Check the grain!" Some shouted, "Take off your cotton pants and use them as sacks, we have to check the grain today!" The Huang family's old maid had just taken two cups of tea on a Western-style porcelain tray and showed half of her body from the doorway of the main room. When she saw this scene, she immediately shrank back behind the felt door curtain. I quickly turned around and stood in front of Liu Jinkuan and his group. Liu Jinkuan said behind me, "We'll settle the score with him." I said, "Right!" Huang Zonggu was a little flustered and hurriedly came to grab my hand, saying, "Lao Wu, give me some face..." When I looked up, I saw his small eyes on his thin yellow face, looking around the courtyard with confusion, a smile barely forced on his face. I suddenly felt that this guy acting familiar and trying to be friends with me in front of this courtyard full of farmers was simply my greatest shame! The fear and respect I had for him on weekdays suddenly disappeared like spring snow meeting the sun. The concept in my mind was exceptionally clear -- Hey! What am I afraid of you for? What are you? You are just a stubborn landlord who illegally exploited people! I immediately pushed his hand away forcefully.
　　The following doesn't need to be said, Liu Jinkuan and the others' rent reduction was naturally victorious. Although Huang Zonggu later wrote a poem about this matter, saying that he was like the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove because he didn't manage production and mistakenly collected some rent, all the cadres in the county who were afraid to see him couldn't help but clap their hands and laugh when they saw this poem.
　　Now you naturally understand that the good teacher and helpful friend I'm referring to is one of those three friends. --Being with Liu Jinkuan is truly better than reading books for ten years! You outsiders always excessively praise those of us who can wield a pen. Actually, don't you know after listening to me? We still have so many past attachments, loneliness, and dreams. It's really embarrassing, often unable to distinguish who our friends are, and confusedly forgetting where our feet are standing. But, as soon as I am in front of Liu Jinkuan, these various broken things are stripped away layer by layer. If you ask about my change, this is the change, learned from this good teacher and helpful friend.
　　You may not be satisfied? But I said earlier that I can't tell you anything rare. This is just a common story that happens everywhere in our area. (Reprinted from: Jicha Jin Daily)

　　三个朋友（续完）
    韦君宜
    以后我还去找过罗平。但是，和刘金宽处久了，倒觉得那些外国人和恋爱纠纷之类，到了耳朵里反而生疏。同时，他那嘻嘻嘻哈哈哈的应酬作风，重新引起了我的反感。我无论工作有困难或生活有问题，都更爱和刘金宽商量。因为刘金宽真能帮我解决，而和罗平说话太绕弯子。我一和老刘在一起，就觉得眼睛也亮了，勇气也来了。我曾经拿他作仗腰子、在那地主朋友面前吐出了一口窝囊气。
    现在该说那个地主朋友了，他就是刘金宽的东家黄四爷，名字叫黄宗谷，他家住在刘家庄，我认识他是以前在城里开参议会的时候，老实说，过去我见了他心里常有点兢兢业业的，因为那家伙有一个出名的脾气，专爱考人。不论那个工作人员见了他，他总是说来说去就把肚里那一套般出来了。什么左传呀唐诗呀，弄得县上许多干部都怕见他。他们几个老头子组织了一个诗社，县上都称他们做“文化界”。我亏着爹娘供我念那几年书，还可以凑合着和他们对答。那个黄宗谷就故意把我当成知己似的，一见面就“咱们念书人”“咱们这些人”，把他做的诗给我看，硬要我批评，甚至要我同他唱和几首。你知道我那旧学，不过是几本国文课本和自己翻着玩的几首诗，我自然害怕在他面前露马脚，一见面就提心吊胆的惟恐被他笑话了去。本来，莫说共产主义思想和黄宗谷风马牛不相及，就是我那十几年的资本主义教育也使我难以接近这套试帖诗式的风雅，但是县上的同志都说：“亏了老吴给咱挣面子，不然咱这统战工作可要丢脸。”这使我又隐约的觉得，别人没法和他们攀交，独有我能，而且能谈得来，能称为朋友，这却是一桩能耐。我曾为这感到暗暗的得意。
    这次到了刘家庄，我自然知道自己是为做下层工作来的，该多和农民在一起，少去接近地主。但是，又觉得譬如一个走江湖卖艺的人，到一个码头，也总该先去拜望当地的要紧人物，场面才能撑得开。因此我还是去看了看黄宗谷，受了他满够交情的招待，直到我和刘金宽他们成了朋友，我才开始觉着这黄宗谷是两面两国的人，拿给我们县上干部看的是一张脸，拿给刘金宽他们看的却是另一张脸。只是在村里路上碰见他，大家都还是满客气，他总又是有什么新开的桃花请我去吟咏，还象好朋友。我照例还是一听见他谈诗论文，就又有些心虚。
    这一直继续到县里发动查租的时候，要地主把去年秋天长收的租退出来。刘金宽是刘家庄减租会的首领，领着租户伙子带着麻袋布袋，到黄宗谷家去了，那天下午我赶到黄家，他家那五十多步宽的青石板大院早都站满了农民，连水磨砖的花台上也蹲着人。吵吵嚷嚷的声音连街上也听见了。从大门一直到三门都敞开着，例外的没有恶狗咬，也没有老妈子应门待客，我悄悄的溜进去，望见黄宗谷站在正中的台阶上，手里还拿着那三尺五的白铜旱烟袋，只是那张瘦黄脸却涨的象他身上的紫铜色绸袍一样，红里透紫，紫里透亮。我看他张着嘴“啊啊”了几声，说不出个下文来，觉得很有趣。本想躲在人背后多看他一会，不料我还没站住，他已经看到了我，细眼睛里立刻发了光，好象抓到救星似的，三脚两步就走下台阶，赶到我面前来，嘴里连声嚷着：“老吴老吴！老吴同志！”一面叫一面就来拉我的手。我那时无可退缩，只得点一点头，从人背后挤出来，满院的农民忽然看见这一幕，都睁大了眼睛看着我和他。都不吵嚷了，院里突然静悄悄的，大家慢慢的向两面闪开。黄宗谷满脸全是奇怪的笑，引着我向廊沿上走，嘴里高声向上房，向厢房，向全院子所有各角落喊叫：“张妈！春子！张妈！来客了！倒茶呀！”立刻院里全充满了他的声音。回头又满面春风的让我：“快请！快请！我正有点东西要请你教正啦！咱很久没有叙一叙啦……”说着笑着，倒好象突然完全忘了有这一院子农民存在似的。——我可怎么能看不见那一百多双熟悉的眼睛？我清清楚楚知道，他们低声咕哝的全是我！——刘金宽正在台阶口上，见我走近，叫了一声：“老吴！”我刚答应一声，黄宗谷又亲手掀起堂屋的毡门帘，又呵着腰连叫“老吴老吴！”一定要让我屋里坐，我不进去，他就亲手把凳子端出来放在廊沿上，嘴里还若无其事的跟我直套交情：“外人不知道，老吴你明白啊！我一向是稽生疏懒，不问家事，呵呵！不爱那求田问舍，家里这些人也实在糊涂，不懂法令，呵呵！你我知交，自然能原谅……”我心里又气又恼，他采取这种态度，简直在故意拆我的台。我直挥手叫他停止，他即滔滔不绝，好象可伶工背台词一样，使我连开口的空子都没有。——亏的是刘金宽替我解了围！
    黄宗谷正说着，台阶口的刘金宽突然上前一步，很严正的又叫我一声：“老吴！咱做甚来了？”我矍然的满脸通红，赶快一跺脚从黄宗谷的凳子上站起来。嗳呀！台阶前面站的刘金开王相如他们八九个一拥上了廊沿，院子中心的人群乱动。人们中间发出呼叫：“肚里饿呀！”“不要骚情呀！”……许多小孩子也从人腿缝里挤进来，喊着“盘粮！”“盘粮！”有的叫：“棉裤脱下顶口袋，今天也得盘粮！”黄家的老妈子刚拿洋磁茶盘托着两杯茶，从上房门口露出半身，一看这景象，马上又缩回那毡门帘里去了。我疾忙一扭身，站在刘金宽他们这一群的前面。刘金宽在我背后说：“咱和他算帐。”我说：“对！”黄宗谷才有点慌了，连忙着来拉我的手，嘴里说：“老吴看我薄面……”我一抬头，看见他那张瘦黄脸上的小眼睛，正向满院子惶惑的张望，脸上勉强堆出笑容。我突然感到，这家伙当着这一院子的农民和我套交情拉朋友，简直是我莫大的耻辱！平日我对他那些胆怯敬畏的意思此时忽然象春雪见太阳一样消灭干净。脑子里的观念异常明确——咦！我怕你什么呢？你是什么？你不过是一个违法盘剥的顽固地主！我立刻用力把手一推。
    下文不用说了，刘金宽他们的减租自然是胜利了的。虽然黄宗谷以后为这件事还做了一首诗，说自己好象竹林七贤。因为不治生产，误收了些租。但是我和县上所有那些怕见他的干部，这回看了这首诗，都忍不住拍手打掌哈哈大笑起来。
    现在你自然懂得了，我所说良师益友，是指的三个朋友中间那一个。——和刘金宽一起，真是胜读十年书！你们外边人老爱过份称赞我们这些会摇摇笔杆的人；其实，你听我说说还不知道？我们还不是照样有这么多往昔的依恋、寂寞、梦幻，真丢人，常常分不清谁是自己的朋友，糊里糊涂忘掉了自己的脚站在什么地方。只是，我一到了刘金宽跟前，这各种破桌西就被他一层一层剥掉了。你要问我的改变，这就算改变，是跟着他这良师益友学来的。
    你也许不满意？但是我早说过我讲不出稀奇东西，这只是在我们这地方，到处都发生过的平平常常的故事。（转载：冀察晋日报）
