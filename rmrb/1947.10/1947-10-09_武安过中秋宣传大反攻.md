　　【This newspaper, Wu'an News】The Wu'an County Committee, two or three days before the Mid-Autumn Festival, issued a notice to all districts to combine the Mid-Autumn Festival with organizing the masses to celebrate the counter-offensive, strengthen current affairs education, and enhance the enthusiasm of the masses for production and thrift to support the front lines. The situation in each district is roughly as follows: 1. Hold celebration meetings, talk about current affairs, recall the emancipation, make vows, and encourage each other's victorious emotions: Boyan in the Third District held a meeting of a thousand people, and the masses who attended the meeting all wore new clothes (the fruits of the distribution) to celebrate. The Eighth District held meetings based on key points. Many of the masses who attended the meeting, encouraged by the victory news, eagerly spoke out their vows. For example, a peasant representative from Chenggang said, "Our whole village will guarantee that 75% of the land is planted with wheat." A military family member from Liuzhuang said, "If my man joins the army, I won't ask the village to do odd jobs at home. I'll save labor to support the front line!" 2. Hold small discussion meetings to check current work and make specific plans to celebrate the counter-offensive with practical actions. In Yangyi, Seventh District, military family members and the masses mutually elected models; first, military family members selected 14 models of preferential treatment for military families, such as Yan Jingxiu, and then the masses selected model military family members. For example, Zhang Mi, a special-class model martyr's family member, sent his son to the army. After his son's sacrifice, he was not pessimistic and still actively led six women's textile factories and twenty-eight textile groups, actively producing and saving, determined to lead the work well, and cooperate between the front and rear to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and avenge his son. Six mutual aid teams in Rushan competed in production during the Mid-Autumn Festival to celebrate the great counter-offensive. In two days, they harvested a total of 108.4 mu of grain, stubbled 47.5 mu; plowed 43.5 mu, harvested 28 mu of mung beans, and planted 27 mu of wheat, turning the Mid-Autumn Festival into a Labor Day. 3. Twisting Yangko, telling allegro, entertainment combined with propaganda for the counter-offensive: There are universal Yangko entertainment class activities throughout the county. Through these entertainment ditties and Yangko, everyone knows that the great counter-offensive has begun. For example, one section of the "Thirty-Four Heads" compiled by Jiujie, Chengguan, is "The national counter-offensive has begun, Liu and Deng's army has arrived in the south; The peasants in the Jiang-controlled area have hope, The struggle for emancipation is about to begin; From the north, to the south, The counter-offensive will be victorious to the end; Kill the traitor Chiang thief; The whole country will have a good year!"

　　【This newspaper, Handan News】In order to support the counter-offensive, Lihua Soap Factory saves one and a half catties of rice per person per day. In terms of materials, only caustic soda can save 75,000 yuan per month. A surge of enthusiasm has also formed among the staff and workers to voluntarily support the front lines. Carpenter Zhang Cunlian said: "I only have one wife at home, and three mu of land, which can take care of her. I don't have much use for money. If I send it to the front, I can buy some bullets to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek!" He voluntarily handed over 400 yuan of his daily wages to the public. Purchasing agent Chen Rongqi also voluntarily handed over 30,000 yuan to the public. Comrade Ma Xuechao said: "I voluntarily contribute all my salary for September, October, and November to support the front." In addition, all employees are actively implementing savings in raw materials, utensils, food, and miscellaneous expenses. In addition to commending the exemplary behavior of the comrades, the leadership also turned this upsurge into the study of land reform.

    【本报武安讯】武安县委会，在中秋节前两三天向各区发出了结合中秋节组织群众庆祝大反攻，加强时事教育，增强群众生产节约支援前线的积极性之通知，各区进行情况大致如下：一、开庆祝大会、讲时事、忆翻身、发誓愿，互相鼓励胜利情绪：三区伯延召开千人大会，参加会的群众都穿着翻身新衣（分的果实）庆祝。八区是以基点为单位开大会，很多参加大会的群众都在胜利消息的鼓舞下争先说出自己誓愿，如城岗一农民代表讲：“我们全村要保证百分之七十五的土地种上麦子。”刘庄军属讲：“男人参军，家里零活我不叫村上代做，省下劳力支援前线！”二、举行小的座谈会，检查当前工作，订具体计划，以实际行动庆祝反攻。七区阳邑，军属群众互选模范；首由军属评选了阎精秀等十四个代耕优军模范，次由群众评选模范军属。如特等模范烈属张密的，送子参军，儿子牺牲后自己不悲观仍积极领导妇女纺织工厂六个，纺织小组廿八组，积极生产节约决心把工作领导好，前后方配合打倒蒋介石为儿报仇。儒山六个互助组在中秋竞赛生产庆祝大反攻，计二天共割谷一○八．四亩，刨茬四十七亩半；犁地四十三亩半，割绿豆廿八亩，种麦二十七亩，变中秋节为劳动节。三、扭秧歌、说快板，娱乐结合宣传大反攻：全县普遍有秧歌娱乐班活动，经过这些娱乐小调秧歌作到人人知道大反攻已经开始。如城关九街编的“三十四个头”中有一段是“全国反攻已开头，刘邓大军到南头；蒋管区农民有盼头，翻身斗争要开头；从北头，到南头，反攻要胜利打到头；杀掉蒋贼卖国头；全国都过好年头！”

    【本报邯郸讯】利华肥皂厂，为了支援反攻，每人每天节约食米一斤半，材料上，只火碱每月可省七万五千元。各职工自愿支援前线也形成热潮，木工张存连说：“我家只有一个老婆，还有三亩地，可以顾住她，我要钱无多的用处，送到前方，可买些子弹，消灭蒋介石！他自愿将每日工资交公四百元。采买员陈荣耆也自愿交公三万元，马学超同志说：“我自愿将九、十、十一三个月的全部薪金支援前方。”此外，各职工均积极在原料、用具、伙食、杂用各方面实行节约。领导上除对各同志模范行为给以表扬外，并以这种热潮转入学习土地改革。
