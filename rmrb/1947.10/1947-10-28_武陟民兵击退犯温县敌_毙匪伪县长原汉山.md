    Wuzhi Militia Repulses Enemy Invading Wen County
    Bandit-Puppet County Chief Yuan Hanshan Killed
    [This Dispatch from Taihang, 25th] On the 13th, our Wuzhi First District militia, in coordination with a unit of camp soldiers, repelled over 200 enemies attempting to infiltrate our Wen County, killing or wounding 15, including the puppet Wen County Chief Yuan Hanshan. At midnight on the 12th, Yuan Hanshan, the puppet Wen County Chief, personally led approximately 200 members of the puppet security regiment and local despotic landlords from Wuzhi, attempting to once again intrude upon our Wen County town. On the morning of the 13th, they passed through Beigu, Gaozhuang, Liucun, and the East and West Tangguo areas, looting like hungry wolves. Even four cornbread buns a child from Dong Tangguo village was taking to the fields were snatched and eaten. In Yangzhao, Dong Tangguo, and West Tangguo villages, a total of 120 items of clothing were stripped from the masses, over 25 *shi* of grain, over 1,000 *jin* of yams, over 10 head of livestock, over 100 pairs of shoes, and over 400 *zhang* of cloth were looted. Upon receiving this information, the Wuzhi First District militia rushed to set up an ambush near Jiaguo village. When the enemy advanced to Jiaguo, our militia launched a three-pronged counterattack. One group engaged the enemy in a fierce battle at Sima Gang, repelling an attack by over 20 enemy soldiers. Another group repelled two enemy attacks at Xiao Jiaguo. A third group blocked the enemy's advance at Dongyan, and in coordination with a squad from our Wen County Public Security Bureau police station, engaged the enemy in fierce fighting, killing or wounding two enemy soldiers. Just as a unit of our camp soldiers arrived, launching an all-out assault on the enemy, the enemy, unable to withstand the attack, fled in panic. We immediately pursued them, killing six people including the puppet county chief Yuan Hanshan, wounding seven, and capturing eight family members of despotic landlords, seizing one bent gun, and recovering three carts of yams, as well as some grain and other supplies. When the masses learned that the puppet county chief had been killed, they were overjoyed. An old man from Dong Tangguo said to others, "Those whoresons are truly evil. I didn't dare to join the peasant association before, fearing they would rob or kill me. This time, they stripped me of all my clothes and shoes. From now on, I will join the peasant association and settle accounts with those whoresons!"
