Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th: A certain unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, advancing from the Huanglong Mountains towards the Guanzhong area under Chiang's control, liberated Hancheng County Town, the headquarters of Chiang's Yellow River defense, in one fell swoop on the 11th. On the 9th, our army first captured Zhichuan, an important town 20 miles south of the city on the highway, and captured more than 80 enemy soldiers in the suburbs of the town, seizing three trucks loaded with coking coal and ten carts from the logistics company of the 158th Regiment of the 53rd Brigade. The enemy entrenched in the town, the Second Battalion of the 158th Regiment and the field artillery company of the 90th Division, fled back to the city in a panic. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue them to the suburbs of the city and immediately occupied the south, west, and north gates of the city, capturing more than 300 Chiang's soldiers and rifles. The Chiang bandits defending the city, the directly subordinate team and two battalions of the 158th Regiment, and the field artillery company of the 90th Division that had fled back, were terrified. On the 11th, they abandoned the city and fled. We are currently in pursuit. Hancheng has been liberated.
　　
Taiyue News, 13th: The Chiang bandits besieged in Yuncheng by our People's Liberation Army are extremely frightened, and desertion has become rampant in recent days. Lower-ranking officers have also surrendered to us. In addition to Wang Tingzhen, the company commander of the 247th Regiment, who escaped from Yuncheng with his pistol and family members to surrender to us, from the 7th to the 9th, Zhao Zhiguo, the deputy squad leader of the 7th squad of the 1st company of the 369th Regiment, Li Liangfu, Li Gao, Dang Zhao, Chen Zhonghui, and others from the machine gun company of the 3rd battalion surrendered. Among them, Wang Wenjun, the squad leader of the 5th squad of the 4th company, felt that it was worthless to work for Chiang Kai-shek, so he organized a collective surrender. Furthermore, due to the rising prices in Yuncheng, the soldiers' lives are extremely miserable. Chinese cabbage has risen from 2,000 yuan per kilogram to 4,500 yuan, and pork has risen from 7,000 yuan per kilogram to 20,000 yuan. Chiang's soldiers receive 1,100 yuan per day for food expenses, but they cannot even eat five liang of Chinese cabbage. The food for soldiers in local security police units is even worse, and the soldiers complain to their superiors: "We've suffered enough, why don't we surrender?"

　　黄龙山区我军东进解放韩城县城
    【新华社西北十三日电】由黄龙山区向蒋管区大关中挺进之西北人民解放军某部，于十一日一举解放蒋记黄河河防指挥部所在地之韩城县城。九日，我军首先攻占该城以南二十里公路线上之芝川重镇，并于该镇近郊俘敌八十余，缴获载焦煤之汽车三辆，及五十三旅一五八团之辎重连大车十辆。盘踞该镇之敌，一五八团第二营及九十师野炮连仓惶逃回城内，我军乘胜追至城郊，当即攻占该城南西北三关，俘获蒋军人枪各三百余，守城蒋匪一五八团团直属队及二个营与逃回之九十师野炮连恐慌万状，于十一日乘隙弃城逃窜，我正追击中；韩城遂获解放。
    【本报太岳十三日电】被我人民解放军围困于运城的蒋匪由于恐惧万分，日来逃风甚炽，下级军官亦向我投诚。除二四七团连长王庭珍携带手枪及眷属逃出运城向我投诚外，七日至九日三天中就有三六九团一营一连七班副班长赵治国、三营机枪连李良甫、李高、党钊、陈忠辉等七人投诚，其中有四连五班班长王文俊感到为蒋介石卖命无丝毫价值，因此组织集体投诚。又因运（城）物价一日数涨，士兵生活苦不堪言，白菜每斤由两千元涨至四千五百元，猪肉每斤由七千元涨至两万元，蒋匪士兵每天伙食费一千一百元，还吃不到五两白菜。地方保警队等士兵的伙食更为恶劣，士兵们都埋怨他们的长官：“这样罪受够了，为什么不投降？”
