Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 26th: The famous Yangji Embankment, north of Yuncheng on the south bank of the Yellow River, has overcome Chiang Kai-shek's manifold obstructions and sabotage during the summer and autumn, and has safely withstood five major floods through round-the-clock emergency repairs. This spring, when Chiang Kai-shek's bandits invaded and occupied the area, they even dug trenches and built碉堡 [diāobǎo, pillboxes] on the堤 [dī, embankment], attempting to breach the embankment and release the water. Fortunately, the bandits were soon driven out by our army, and our Third Repair and Defense Office immediately rushed to carry out emergency repairs. The project was successfully completed under the cover of our armed forces, allowing us to safely weather the first major flood. During the second major flood in August, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits again invaded and occupied places such as Liulou, ten miles away from Yangji. At that time, the坝埽 [bàsào, embankment aprons] of that section were scoured by the floodwaters. On August 19th, the first坝 [bà, dike] was destroyed, half of the second坝 [bà, dike] was twisted off by the floodwaters, the base of the third坝 [bà, dike] was submerged by two公寸 [gōngcùn, approx. 2 cm], and the embankment between the third, fourth, and fifth坝 [bà, dike] was also scoured by more than three公尺 [gōngchǐ, meters], creating an extremely dangerous situation and imminent breach. The Third Repair and Defense Office rushed to the rescue, but Chiang's troops frequently harassed and obstructed the construction. Disregarding any danger, the Repair and Defense Office carried out emergency repairs under armed cover. Director Meng Xiaodong personally participated in making埽 [sào, fascines], and five hundred nearby civilians spontaneously came to participate in driving piles and throwing stones, working tirelessly for eight days and nights in the wind, rain, and blazing sun, finally turning the crisis into safety. Afterwards, Chiang's bandits frequently harassed, and the construction of additional埽坝 [sàobà, fascine dikes] had to be carried out at night. During the fourth major flood on September 9th, the fourth坝 [bà, dike] was again scoured, with five公尺 [gōngchǐ, meters] of its entire body being torn away. The Repair and Defense Office immediately used large ropes to cable the embankment, and after tense round-the-clock emergency repairs, they were able to escape danger. During the fifth major flood in mid-September, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits from Yuncheng invaded the riverbank as far as Zhudian, only one里 [lǐ, approx. 0.5 km] away from Yangji, firing their guns to obstruct the work, causing the project to be intermittent, but the scoured parts were still repaired one after another.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 26th: The Shandong River Affairs Bureau recently published a report on the achievements of our army and people in the Bohai area in repairing the Yellow River from last year to mid-July of this year, stating that there were 43 dangerous sections on the 690里 [lǐ, approx. 0.5 km] long river堤 [dī, embankment] east of the Jinpu Railway. Last year, emergency repairs were carried out on 26 critical dangerous sections. This year, Chiang's bandits violated the agreement and blocked the breach, and after the Yellow River suddenly returned to its old course, our Party, government, army, and people again concentrated their efforts on emergency repairs. The masses enthusiastically contributed bricks and materials, and braved the炮击 [pàojī, shelling] and bombing by Chiang's bandits to repair the critical dangerous sections amidst the raging waves. From the beginning of last year to mid-July of this year, a total of 20,320,000 cubic公尺 [gōngchǐ, meters] of earthwork were completed, using 46,200,700 civilian labor days. Material costs amounted to 4,599,211,295 North China currency. At present, the dangerous sections such as Yuangaojia are still being repaired. During the Yellow River management period, 205 embankment repair workers were killed and 100 were injured by Chiang's aircraft bombing, and 45 were captured by Chiang's troops.

　　战胜蒋匪百般阻挠破坏
  　杨集险工五次安渡大泛
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十六日电】黄河南岸郓城以北之著名杨集险工，夏秋间战胜蒋匪百般阻挠破坏，昼夜抢修已安渡五次大泛。今春蒋匪侵踞该地时，竟在堤上挖壕建碉，企图决堤放水，幸该匪不久即为我军驱逐，我第三修防处当即赶往抢险，工程在我武装掩护下顺利完成，始得安然渡过了第一次大泛。八月第二次大泛到来，蒋匪又侵踞距杨集十里之刘楼等地。当时该段坝埽被洪水掏刷，八月十九日第一坝掉蛰，第二坝被洪水扭掉一半，第三坝基被淹没二公寸，三、四、五坝之间大堤亦被掏去三公尺多，危险万状，即将决口。第三修防处急往抢救，而蒋军则经常出扰，阻挠施工。修防处不顾任何危险，在武装掩护下抢修，该处孟晓东主任亲自参加做埽，附近五百群众自动赶来参加打桩抛石，在风雨烈日下八昼夜未停，始转危为安。其后蒋匪出扰频繁，增修埽坝被迫在夜间进行。九月九日第四次大泛，第四坝又被掏刷，全身被撕去五公尺，修防处即以大绠将堤缆住，连夜紧张抢修，始克脱险。九月中旬五次大泛时郓城蒋匪曾侵至河边距杨集仅一里之朱店，鸣枪阻挠，使工程时断时续，但被掏刷部分仍经先后修复。
    【新华社华东二十六日电】山东河务局日前发表渤海区我军民自去年至今年七月半之修黄成绩称：津浦线东长达六百九十里的河堤有险工四十三处，去年赶修急要险工二十六处，今年蒋贼违约堵口，黄水突然归故后，我党政军民复集中全力抢险，群众踊跃献砖献料，并冒蒋匪之炮击与飞机轰炸，在狂浪翻腾中将急要险工修好。从去年开始至今年七月半止，共完成二千零卅二万方公尺土，用民工四千六百二十万零七百个。用去材料费北币四十五亿九千九百二十一万一千二百九十五元。刻源高家等处险工仍均在修补中。治黄期间修堤员工被蒋机炸毙者达二百零五人，负伤者一百人，被蒋军捕去的四十五人。
