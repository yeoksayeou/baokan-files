　　Great Counter-Offensive News Reaches Qi-Yu
　　Masses Volunteer to Carry Stretchers
　　[Our Newspaper] The turned-over peasants of Qi-Yu, hearing the news of the start of the national counter-offensive, were overjoyed and extremely excited. The masses in all districts competed to volunteer to go to the front lines to carry stretchers and drive carts. Those who could not go vowed to work hard in production at home and take care of the families of those who went on the expedition. The masses in various villages in the Fifth District launched enthusiastic challenges and volunteered to sign up. At a mass meeting in Deng Village, Zhang Dazeng, Wu Xisheng, Deng Huaishan, Deng Huailing, and four others volunteered to go as laborers. Those who could not go were unhappy, so they voluntarily donated travel expenses to show their enthusiasm and stated that they would lead the re-examination, production, and autumn harvest at home. Su Jingang from Sulu in the Sixth District said, "I used to suffer from poverty and hunger. Now Chairman Mao has led me to turn over. Now I hear that our army is going south for the counter-offensive, and I am also volunteering to go to the front line. If we don't defeat Old Chiang, the turn-over is not thorough, and the rice bowl is not secure. I will not return home until the task is completed." After he said this, all the stretcher team members vowed with righteous indignation. Gao Da Niang from Tangfang in the Second District was very poor in the past and had three sons. This year, after re-examination, she got land. She often said, "I have lived a life of poverty for half my life, and today I can finally eat a full meal and wear a whole piece of clothing. It's all thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership." This time, when she heard that General Liu Bocheng had won a victory in the south, she volunteered at a mass meeting in the village to send her eldest son and said, "I won't come back until I defeat Old Chiang, that good-for-nothing." After the masses at home heard this, they all said, "When you go to the front, we will work hard in production at home and take care of you."

  　群众自报出担架
    【本报讯】齐禹翻身农民，听到全国大反攻开始的消息，欢欣鼓舞兴奋异常，各区群众都争先恐后的自报上前线抬担架、赶大车。去不了的，都盟誓在家好好生产，照顾出征人员的家庭。五区各村群众掀起热烈的挑战，自动报名。邓庄群众大会上，张大曾、武希圣、邓怀山、邓怀岭等六人自动报名出夫，不能去的，都不高兴，后来他们自动献路费，表示个人的热心，并表明在家领导复查、生产、秋收。六区宿楼宿金刚说：“先前我受穷受饿，于今毛主席领导我翻了身，现在听说咱大军南下反攻了，我也自报上前线，不打倒老蒋，翻身总是不彻底、饭碗总是不牢靠；完不成任务，我是不回家的。”他这样一说，全体担架队员都很义愤的盟了誓。二区塘坊高大娘，过去很穷，有三个儿子，今年复查得了地，她常说：“我过了半辈子穷日子，今天才能吃顿饱饭，穿件囫囵衣裳，这都是毛主席领导的。”这次她听到刘伯承将军南下胜利，她在全村群众大会上，自报叫她大儿子去，并说：“不打倒老蒋这个孬种，不回来。”在家群众听了后，都说：“你们到前方，我们在家好好生产，照顾你们。”
