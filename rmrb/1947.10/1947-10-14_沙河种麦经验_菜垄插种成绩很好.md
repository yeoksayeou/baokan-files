Shahe Wheat Planting Experience
　　Vegetable Ridge Interplanting Achieves Great Results
    [This newspaper dispatch] In the large-scale wheat planting, Shahe has gained a simple fertilization experience: Select the good wheat seeds, soak them in warm water first, then mix them with sesame oil (four or five taels of oil per mu of land), dry them in the sun before planting, which is equivalent to applying base fertilizer once. In addition, there are many late vegetables this year, so they also promoted vegetable ridge interplanting, and the results are very good. Now the wheat seedlings have grown to one inch high and are very vigorous. Due to the general lack of fertilizer this year and the abundance of late vegetables, Shahe's innovation should be widely promoted to increase the sown area and harvest.

　　沙河种麦经验
  　菜垄插种成绩很好
    【本报讯】大量种麦中沙河得出简易施肥经验：将选好的麦种，先用温水浸了，然后再用香油拌拌（每亩地的种用四、五两油），晒干后种上，等于上一次底粪。另外今年晚菜多，他们又提倡了菜垄插种，成绩都很好。现在麦苗都长出一寸高，很旺。由于今年普遍缺乏肥料，晚菜也多，沙河的这种创造，应该普遍推广，以增加播种面积及收成。（太行一专署）
