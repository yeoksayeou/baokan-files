Along the Border of Hebei, Shandong and Henan Provinces
　　Liberated Peasants Arm Themselves to Protect Grain and Fields
    The Linze Third District Work Team Achieves Three Victories in Three Battles Against Grain Robbery
[Our Newspaper Hebei, Shandong and Henan Dispatch, 10th] “Strengthen the struggle in the marginal areas, and actively strike at the Chiang bandits who are robbing grain and conscripting soldiers!” This is the slogan of action in the marginal areas of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan; under this slogan, significant achievements have been made in various places. In Fengqiu Third District, the landlord restoration corps, in conjunction with small groups of enemies, robbed grain and harassed the people everywhere. In Gezhao Village, seven poor peasant families who had been liberated were robbed, and one woman was beaten to death. Enraged, the masses demanded the establishment of grain protection teams to implement home defense and self-defense. After Gezhao Village was robbed three times, the masses spontaneously armed themselves and formed a self-defense team of more than ninety people, and developed a district grain protection team of fifteen people. On the night of August 10th, three enemy "guerrilla" groups came to the village for the fourth time to rob grain. The self-defense team sentries discovered them and used drums as a signal. The team members rose up and surrounded and chased the enemy from all directions, driving them out of the village for ten miles, and seizing back a large cart and three livestock that the enemy had pulled away from Xihuang Village. Since then, the enemy has not dared to easily move out to rob grain. The militia grain protection team of Junxian Sixth District, in coordination with the county brigade, chased the Chiang Kai-shek army that was robbing grain to the Qi River on September 10th, capturing two enemies and seizing two guns. On the same day, our grain protection team ambushed outside Junxian city, capturing five enemies, seizing five guns, and arresting thirty fleeing landlords. In Qihe city, more than 300 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, carrying six light machine guns, went to Yangfang, Shimen, and Zhang Dayinzhuang areas in Qihe Fifth District on September 10th to rob grain and conscript soldiers. A certain unit of our Sixth Sub-district local corps, in order to maintain the autumn harvest of the masses, dispatched troops to attack in separate routes. The enemy was unable to resist and collapsed. We followed and pursued, chasing the enemy back into the city, seizing eleven rifles, capturing twelve enemies alive, and killing and wounding eighteen enemies. In addition, the militia in Qiyu Fifth District fought the grain-robbing enemies twenty-three times in twenty days. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang Wang Erzhuaji (Wang Zhaotai) and his troops, in coordination with more than a thousand local landlord restoration corps, constantly harassed the Fifth District to rob grain. Almost every day, they used two or more companies of troops to rob grain from villages, and the masses were unable to harvest their crops. In order to defend the autumn harvest, the militia scattered in the border area for more than ten miles to guard against the enemy. The rear organized more than 300 large carts to collectively help the masses in the guerrilla area with the autumn harvest. The militia in the district fought extremely bravely. In addition to a rifle for each person, they also had a red-tasseled spear, ready to use when fighting the enemy in close combat. In the Doufuwo war, they waded through waist-deep mud to attack the enemy fiercely, and finally repelled the enemy. In the twenty-three battles, more than twenty enemies were killed and wounded, and only one militiaman was slightly injured. After a very short period of land reform in Yanjin Second District, the masses partially obtained land. The enemy frequently harassed them, robbing the masses of their fruits (i.e., the crops in the fields). In order to defend the autumn harvest, the masses organized joint defense and cooperated with the district team to strike at the enemy. The enemy went to Macun three times and was repelled each time. In the last time, three enemies were killed, two were captured alive, and four steel guns, one short gun, and one horse were seized. At present, joint defense has been generally organized in the border area of Yanjin, and the morale of the masses has been unprecedentedly high. Men are rushing to cut sorghum and millet, women and children are picking cotton. Macun harvested one-third of the crops in one day.

[Our Newspaper Hebei, Shandong and Henan Dispatch, 10th] The Bian Luji Work Team of Linze Third District, armed to strike the enemy robbing grain and conscripting soldiers, defended the autumn harvest and wheat planting of the masses, achieving three victories in five days, with twenty enemies killed or wounded, and no casualties on our side. On August 22nd, Guo Yongxiu, the enemy in the eastern district of Heze territory, led more than 300 people to rob grain in the southern area of Linze Third District. Upon hearing this news, our Bian Luji Work Team, in order to protect the interests of the masses, led twelve team members to launch a surprise attack on the enemy, who outnumbered us by more than ten times. The enemy was panicked and routed. We captured an enemy scout alive, and the five carts of wheat that the enemy had robbed were also intercepted by us and sent to the masses. On the 24th, the enemy Guo Yongxiu again led his troops to rob grain in the Zhoulou area of the Third District. Our work team immediately inflicted casualties on them with firepower, killing one enemy and wounding three. The enemy did not rob the masses of a single grain of food. After the enemy's two grain-robbing plans were smashed by us, Guo Yongxiu's troops, under the pressure of hunger and poverty, combined with Liu Xihua's troops from the northern district of Heze city, totaling more than 500 people, and on the 25th, they robbed grain in the Wumiao, Li Matang, and Shaozhuang areas of our Sixth and Third Districts. Our Bian Luji Work Team rushed from a certain place more than ten miles away, and with the force of divine soldiers descending from the sky, inserted themselves into the enemy's flanks. After an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered fifteen casualties, leaving behind two corpses, and fled in the direction of Heze. Later, we captured an enemy scout alive. Under the pressure of an enemy force that outnumbered us by more than ten times, we suffered no casualties, smashed the enemy's three grain-robbing plans, and defended the interests of the masses, which won the deep love and support of the masses. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, the masses sent gifts one after another, but all were declined.

  　翻身农民武装保粮保田
    临泽三区武工队反抢粮三战三捷
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】“加强边缘区斗争，积极打击蒋匪抢粮抓丁!”这是冀鲁豫边缘区行动口号；在这口号下各地屡获显著成绩。封邱三区地主还乡团结合小股敌人，到处抢粮骚扰，葛召村翻身贫农，曾被抢七户，并被打死妇女一人，群众激愤之下，纷纷要求成立保田队，实行保家自卫。葛召村被三次抢劫后，群众自动成立武装，组成自卫队九十余人，并发展区保田队十五人。八月十日夜，敌三个“游击队”小组，第四次到该村抢粮，自卫队岗哨发觉后，以鼓为号，队员奋起四面包围、追赶，遂将敌逐出十里路外，并夺回敌在西黄庄拉走之大车一辆及牲口三头。自此以后，敌不敢轻易出动抢粮。浚县六区民兵保田队，配合县大队于九月十日追逐抢粮蒋军至淇河，俘敌二名，缴枪二支。同日，我保田队设伏于浚县城外，俘敌五名，缴枪五支，并捕逃亡地主三十人。齐河城内，蒋军三百余人，携轻机枪六挺，于九月十日到齐河五区杨坊、石门、张大尹庄一带抢粮抓丁，我六分区地方兵团某部，为维护群众秋收，当分路出动袭击，敌不支溃退，我跟踪追击，将敌撵回城内，计缴获步枪十一支，生俘敌十二名，毙伤敌十八名。又齐禹五区民兵二十天内，与抢粮敌人战斗达二十三次。蒋家匪帮王二抓鸡（王照台）部，配合该地还乡团地主千余人，不断向五区出扰抢粮，差不多每天要用两个连以上的兵力向各村庄抢粮，群众庄稼不能收割。为保卫秋收，民兵散布在边沿区十余里之地带，警戒敌人，后方组织了三百余辆大车集体帮助游击区群众秋收，该区民兵作战极为勇敢，他们除每人一支大枪外，并有一支红缨枪，准备与敌人肉搏时用。在豆腐窝战争中，他们曾淌着腰多深的泥水，向敌人猛攻，终将敌人击退。在二十三次战斗中，毙伤敌二十余名，民兵仅一人负轻伤。延津二区经过很短时间的土地改革，群众部分得到土地，敌人经常出扰，抢群众的果实（即地里的庄稼），群众为保卫秋收，组织联防配合区队打击敌人，敌人连去马村三次，均被击退，最后一次打死敌三名生俘二名，缴钢枪四支，短枪一支，马一匹。现延津边沿区已普遍组织了联防，群众情绪空前提高，男人抢割高粱、谷子，妇女儿童摘花，马村一天内即抢收庄稼三分之一。
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】临泽三区边鲁吉武工队，武装打击敌人抢粮抓丁，保卫群众秋收种麦，五天三捷，敌死伤二十名，我无伤亡。八月二十二日，菏泽境东区敌郭永修，率领三百余人到临泽三区南部一带抢粮，我边鲁吉武工队闻讯，为着保卫群众利益，率领十二名队员，在敌多于我十余倍兵力下，出敌不意时给以猛冲，敌一时恐慌万状，溃不成军，我活捉敌侦探一名，敌抢的五车麦子，也为我截下送交群众。二十四日敌郭永修又率部到三区周楼一带抢粮，我武工队即给与火力杀伤，击毙敌一名，伤三名，敌未抢去群众一粒粮食。敌两次抢粮计划被我粉碎后，郭永修部在饥困之下，便结合菏泽城北区敌刘锡华部共五百余人，于二十五日又向我六区吴庙、李马堂、三区邵庄一带抢粮，我边鲁吉武工队由十多里之某地迅速赶来，以神兵天降之势，插进敌侧背，激战一小时，敌伤亡十五名，遗尸两具，向菏泽方向逃窜，后又被我活捉敌探一名。在敌多于我十余倍的兵力下，我毫无伤亡，粉碎敌三次抢粮计划，保卫了群众利益，深得群众的爱戴与拥护，中秋节时，群众纷纷送礼，均为谢绝。
