(This dispatch from our Taiyue office, dated the 29th) In order to resolutely implement the land reform policy and enable peasants to completely liberate themselves, and to completely block the "air raid shelters" of the landlord class, the Taiyue Administrative Office has issued further instructions to all counties to launch a campaign to investigate and squeeze out feudalism. The following is a summary: 1. The purpose of the investigation and squeeze out campaign is to enable government cadres to clarify and strengthen their class stance, to rescue and educate certain cadres from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds to reform their thinking and improve their awareness. Therefore, it is necessary to resolutely rectify the class ranks and thoroughly cleanse the targets of struggle. The investigation and squeeze out campaign is a mass movement within government organs, and all levels should act in unison without exception. 2. Open up the minds of cadres and miscellaneous staff to eliminate concerns. All attitudes of only investigating others and not oneself, hearsay, conjecture, deceit, hypocrisy, and lack of sincerity should be corrected. Squeezing out feudalism means recognizing feudalism in the investigation of thought, raising awareness, and washing away the feudal forces in every department and corner of governments at all levels. 3. According to known materials, the Administrative Office, the First, Second, and Fourth Administrative Offices, and the county governments of Changzi, Tunliu, Jiexiu, Hongdong, Qingshui, Zhaocheng, Gaoping, and others, as well as some district offices, have launched a high tide of investigation and squeeze out campaigns. However, many counties and districts have not yet been involved in this movement. Therefore, it is required that governments at all levels of special districts, counties, districts, and villages immediately take action to thoroughly eliminate the "air raid shelters" of the landlord class. Finally, several key points for the investigation and squeeze out campaign are put forward: (1) Promote the movement with poor and hired peasants as the backbone. (2) Start with telling grievances, pouring out all the bitterness, and exposing the crimes of the landlord class. (3) Start from the urgent demands of the masses, strengthen ideological leadership, enlighten cadres from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds to reflect and confess frankly, and educate them to abandon their original positions and serve the peasants. (4) Those who have been identified as targets of struggle should be quickly cleansed and handed over to the masses for disposal. (5) For those who have been in the revolution for many years, but whose ideology and work style are not good, their ideological reflection should be strengthened, and mass ideological struggle should be launched, and they should not be treated the same as the targets of struggle.

　　坚决整顿阵容更好服务群众
  　太岳行署再指示查挤封建
    【本报太岳二十九日电】此间行署为坚决贯澈土改政策，使农民彻底翻身；并完全堵死地主阶级的“防空洞”，再指示各县掀起查挤封建运动，现摘要如下：一、查挤运动的目的，在于使政权干部明确坚定自己的阶级立场，挽救与教育某些地主富农出身的干部改造思想提高觉悟，因此必须坚决整顿阶级阵容，彻底清洗斗争对象。查挤运动是政府机关中的群众运动，应该上下一致毫无例外的行动起来。二、打通干部杂务人员的思想消除顾虑，一切单查别人不查自己，道听途说捕风捉影，欺诈虚伪缺乏诚意的态度都应纠正。挤查封建，在查思想中认识封建，提高觉悟，洗刷各级政府的每一部门及每个角落的封建势力。三、据已知材料，行署、第一、二、四专署，长子、屯留、介休、洪洞、沁水、赵城、高平等县政府及某些区公所已掀起了查挤运动的高潮，但仍有许多县区未卷入这一运动，所以要求专县区村各级政府立即行动起来彻底消灭地主阶级的“防空洞”。最后并提出查挤运动的几个要点：（一）以贫雇为骨干推进运动。（二）从诉苦入手倒尽苦水，揭发地主阶级的罪恶。（三）从群众迫切要求出发，加强思想领导，启发地主富农出身的干部反省坦白，教育其放弃原来立场，为农民服务。（四）已经发现了的斗争对象，迅速予以清洗，交群众处理。（五）对革命多年，但思想作风不好的人，则应加强其思想反省，展开群众性的思想斗争，不能与斗争对象同等看待。
