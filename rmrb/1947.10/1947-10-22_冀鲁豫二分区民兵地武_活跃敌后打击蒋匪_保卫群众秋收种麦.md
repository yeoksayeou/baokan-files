　　[Report from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 19th] The militia and local armed forces in the enemy-occupied Second Military District, including the counties of Juancheng, Yuncheng, and Linze, are actively fighting against enemies who are seizing grain, protecting the masses' autumn harvest and wheat planting. On September 30th (before Juancheng was recovered), the enemy county brigade in Juancheng, combined with district teams, numbering over a thousand, set out to seize grain from more than ten villages, including Dianzishang and Yilou in northern Juancheng, harassing the masses' autumn harvest and wheat planting. Upon hearing this, our militia and armed forces immediately attacked the enemy. After three hours of fierce fighting, the enemy, unable to withstand the assault, fled in a panic. Our militia pursued the enemy for fifteen *li*, intercepted the five large carts of wheat that the enemy had seized, and returned them to the masses. When an old woman from Dianzi got back her wheat seeds that had been seized by Chiang's army, she said with great joy, "I have to hurry up and plant the land tomorrow, or I won't be able to plant wheat this year." The Linze work team militia also repeatedly defeated grain-grabbing enemies, recovering more than 7,000 *jin* of grain. In Yuncheng's third district, in order to oppose conscription and grain seizure, and to carry out the autumn harvest and wheat planting, the masses voluntarily organized a mass intelligence network, enabling the guerrillas to launch attacks at any time after receiving information. In mid-September, we won six battles in six engagements, thwarting the enemy's grain-grabbing plan, and the morale of the masses was extremely high. Currently, under the cover of our militia and guerrillas, the three counties have completed the autumn harvest and are launching a concentrated effort to plant wheat.

　　冀鲁豫二分区民兵地武
  　活跃敌后打击蒋匪
  　保卫群众秋收种麦
    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】敌后二分区鄄城、郓城、临泽等县民兵地方武装，积极打击抢粮敌人，保卫群众秋收种麦。九月三十日（鄄城收复前），鄄城敌县大队结合各区队约千余人，向我鄄北店子上、仪楼等十余村出发抢粮，骚扰群众秋收种麦。我民兵武装闻讯后，即向敌人出击，经激战三小时，敌不支狼狈逃窜。我民兵追敌十五里，把敌抢走整五大车麦子截回，交还群众。当店子一位老大娘又得回她已被蒋军抢去的麦种时，欣喜万分说：“明天得赶快耩地了，不然今年的麦就种不上。”临泽武工队民兵亦屡败抢粮敌人，抢回粮食七千余斤。郓城三区群众为反抓丁抢粮及秋收种麦，自动组织大众情报网，使游击队接到情报后，能随时出击。九月中我曾六战六捷，粉碎敌抢粮计划，群众情绪极为高涨。现三县在我民兵游击队的掩护下，已秋收完毕，正突击种麦中。
