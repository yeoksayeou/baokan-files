Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Comprehensive report: The UN Trusteeship Council Committee has held meetings for more than three weeks since the 24th of last month. Throughout the meeting, countries occupying colonies were in an extremely embarrassing situation; and the Soviet Union's opinions often received the support of the majority of countries. When discussing the five proposals of the Special Committee on Non-Self-Governing Territories, the Soviet delegation proposed, in the case of "trust territories should provide more reference materials for the Secretary-General's use," that countries occupying colonies must submit comparative figures on the living standards of the people in the colonies and the suzerain states. The United States, Britain, France and other countries feared that this supplementary opinion would expose the cruel exploitation of the colonial people by the countries occupying colonies, and therefore resolutely opposed it. As a result, with the support of the majority of countries such as Iraq and India, the Soviet opinion was adopted. The Soviet delegation also requested that in the case of "trust territories providing information on the local people's participation in local administrative bodies," an item on political information should be added to prevent them from deceiving the world and concealing the fact that the colonial people could not obtain legal protection in politics. The majority of countries, including Colombia, Iraq, India and Byelorussia, immediately supported it, defeating the sophistry of the countries occupying colonies. When the conference discussed the proposal to "establish a special UN committee to study information on non-self-governing territories," the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and other countries occupying colonies opposed it, but the original proposal was finally passed by a vote.

　　联大托管小组会议中
  　苏提案得广大拥护
  　英美法等国无法招架
    【新华社陕北十九日电】综合报导：自上月二十四日迄今，联大托管小组委员会举行了三周多的会议。整个会议中，各占有殖民地的国家处境极为狼狈；而苏联的意见，则常常获得大多数国家的拥护。在讨论非自治领特别委员会的五项提案时，苏联代表团提议在“被托管国应提供更多的参考材料供秘书长应用”一案中，要求各占有殖民地的国家，必须提出殖民地与宗主国人民生活水准的比较数字，美英法等害怕这一补充意见会暴露各占有殖民地国家对于殖民地人民之残酷压榨，因而坚决加以反对；结果终因伊拉克、印度等大多数国家的支持，苏联意见获得通过。苏联代表团又要求在“被托管国提供当地人民参加地方行政机蒂的情报”一案中，增加各被托管国应提出政治方面的情报一项，以防他们欺骗世人，遮盖殖民地人民在政治上不能得到法律保障的事实。哥伦比亚、伊拉克、印度及白俄罗斯等大多数国家，也立即予以拥护，击败了各占有殖民地的国家诡辩。当大会讨论至“成立一联合国特别委员会以研究非自治领之情报”一提案时，美、英、法、荷、比等各占有殖民地国家虽群起反对，但投票结果终通过了原建议案。
