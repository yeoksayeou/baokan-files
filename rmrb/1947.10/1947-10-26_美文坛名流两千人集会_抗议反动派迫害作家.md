Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: New York dispatch: Prominent figures in the American literary world recently held a grand gathering here, unanimously resolving to demand the abolition of the House Un-American Activities Committee; and to pay tribute to the victimized writers Howard and Fast. The latter was sentenced to three months in prison for refusing to hand over the documents of the "Committee to Aid Victims of Fascist Persecution" for review by the Un-American Activities Committee. The conference was sponsored by the editorial departments of the weekly "New Masses" and the literary quarterly "Mainstream," and was attended by 2,000 famous writers, poets, painters, professors, journalists, and musicians. Fast's lawyer, former Assistant Attorney General Rogge, stated: "The current persecution of communists is the most vicious in American history." He said: America is heading down the road to a fascist police state and called on the broad masses to support the victims of reactionary persecution. In his speech, Fast denounced the thugs of the "Un-American Activities Committee" as "the number one most vicious enemy of America"; and urged writers to fight for democracy. Many celebrities delivered speeches or sent telegrams to the conference. Among them was a joint message of condolence from more than 50 people in the French cultural circles, signed by Aragon, secretary of the French Writers Association, and others. Note: Fast, who was sentenced to three months in prison, is a well-known young left-wing American writer in his early thirties, and is the author of the historical novels "Citizen Paine" and "Freedom Road," among others. The former has already been translated into Chinese.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: New York dispatch: The American "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People" recently submitted a memorandum to the United Nations, condemning American discrimination against black people and its imperialist aggression policy towards the world. The association is the largest black organization in the United States, with 500,000 members. The memorandum pointed out: The United States shows no sympathy for colored people and small and weak nations. After detailing the deprivation of basic democratic rights of black people in the United States, the memorandum strongly stated: The attitude of the United States towards black people is completely contrary to the spirit of the Declaration of Independence. The memorandum believes that the United Nations has the responsibility to study and protect the basic freedoms and rights of all mankind. Therefore, the black problem is not only a domestic problem of the United States, but also an international problem within the United Nations.

  　抗议反动派迫害作家
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】纽约讯：美国文坛名流顷于此间举行盛大集会，一致决议要求解放众院非美活动委员会；并向被害之名作家荷瓦德、费斯特致敬，后者因拒绝将“援助遭法西斯迫害的受难者委员会”之文件交给非美活动委员会审查而被判处徒刑三月。大会系由“新群众”周刊及文学季刊“主流”之编辑部主催，到有名作家、诗人、画家、教授、记者，及音乐家二千人。费氏之律师前助理司法部长罗格称：“目前对共产党的迫害，在美国历史上是最凶恶的。”他说：美国正朝着法西斯警察制的道路上走，并要求广大群众支持遭受反动派迫害的受难者。费斯特在其演说中指斥“非美活动委员会”的恶棍们，是“美国第一号的最凶恶敌人”；并敦促作家们为民主而奋斗。很多名流都在大会上发表演说，或致电大会。其中有法国文化界五十余人的联名慰问电一件，签字者有法作家协会书记阿拉贡等人。按：被判三月徒刑之费斯特为年仅三十余岁之美国著名青年左翼作家，著有历史小说“公民潘恩”及“自由之路”等书，前者已有中文译本。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】纽约讯：美“全国有色人民福利促进会”顷向联合国提出备忘录，谴责美国对黑人之歧视，及其向世界之帝国主义侵略政策。该会为美国最大之黑人组织，拥有会员五十万人，备忘录指出：美国对有色人种及弱小民族丝毫不表同情。备忘录在详述美国剥夺黑人基本民主权利后，力称：美国对黑人之态度，完全与独立宣言之精神背道而驰。备忘录认为联合国有责任研究并保护全人类的基本自由和权利，因此黑人问题不仅是美国国内问题，且亦为联合国中的国际问题。
