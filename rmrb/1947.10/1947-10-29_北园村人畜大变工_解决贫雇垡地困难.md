　　North Garden Village's Human and Livestock Labor Exchange
  　Solving the Difficulties of Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers in Clearing Land
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, October 27th] The Wang Chang mutual aid team in North Garden Village, Qinyuan, discovered during the organization of a concentrated autumn land clearing effort that 58 poor peasant and hired laborer households and impoverished military family members lacked livestock and were unable to clear their land in the autumn. The village had 1,854 mu of land to be cleared in the autumn, but only 19 head of livestock. Each head of livestock could plow an average of five mu per day. From October 16th until the ground froze around November 10th, they could only plow 1,425 mu, leaving 459 mu unplowed. More than 440 mu of this belonged to the 58 poor peasant and military family households, meaning they would not be able to plow their land. Even those households with livestock were short of labor to plow due to supporting the front lines and participating in the war. If this was not organized and adjusted, the village's autumn land clearing would be problematic. The village's mutual aid team convened a mass meeting on the 16th to discuss and resolve this issue. Everyone decided to plow the 108.25 mu of land belonging to the 15 most impoverished peasant and military family households without compensation, with all labor used calculated as preferential treatment for military families. For the remaining 43 households without livestock, they would use human and livestock labor exchange or pay wages to clear the land. It was decided to pay 18 labor points per mu plowed or 9 sheng of millet. Starting on the 16th, all 19 head of livestock in the village were organized to plow the land piece by piece, regardless of whose land it was. After harvesting the crops, all 109 able-bodied men in the village (including 89 semi-able-bodied who were equivalent to 44 full able-bodied) were organized to concentrate on digging the land, averaging 0.7 mu per person per day, which would allow them to dig 76.25 mu in one day. In this way, the more than 450 mu of land that could not be plowed by livestock could be dug in six days with manpower. Even if not all people could participate fully, it could be dug and plowed before the ground froze in mid-November.
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, October 27th] After Qinyuan District One harvested more than 50,000 mu of crops, they began organizing more than 300 head of livestock to clear the land on the 15th. In five days, they had cleared more than 3,500 mu of autumn land. According to the district head, they could complete all the land clearing by the end of the ninth lunar month. Why were they able to harvest and clear the land so quickly? First, they organized all the women, children, and elderly men, assigning specific tasks and maximizing their strength. In the Luerhui base point of eight villages, over one hundred mutual aid groups were organized during the autumn harvest and planting, totaling 1,471 people, more than double the number in the spring. Although 26 civilian laborers from Luerhui Village went to the front lines, the 30 women in the Li Yulong team and the Wang Aiyuan group completed the harvesting of all crops in ten days. The elderly and widowed in the Hu Sheze group also participated in the mutual aid group. A 55-year-old woman in Huodeng Village took turns with her daughter-in-law to participate in the mutual aid group. In each village, the elderly men steered the plows and did manual labor, the women and children harvested, and the young people carried, with each person appropriately using their strength. Second, they conducted on-site inspections. District cadres cooperated with village cadres, and villages conducted timely mutual evaluations, promoting advantages and making preliminary assessments of grades, which greatly promoted the autumn harvest and land clearing. The inspections revealed that Muhuayuan harvested quickly, with the land cleared and the fields empty in half a month. The Wangjiayuan followed harvesting with plowing, having already cleared 300 mu of land. The Wang Chang team in North Garden Village saved livestock power to plow the land, organized all and half able-bodied labor to dig the land, and solved the difficulties of poor peasants and impoverished military families who lacked livestock for autumn land clearing. The Xuemeng Village organized all the village's human and livestock power, clearing the land piece by piece from the edge of the village outwards, regardless of whose land it was, and recorded labor points and made evaluations every night, which everyone said was a good method. After the district-wide inspection, these villages were rated as first-class, and their advantages were introduced to other villages, which promoted the lagging Hexi, Dongjia, Nansi, and other villages. For example, Dongjia had five head of livestock clearing land the day after the inspection. Third, the scores for semi-able-bodied laborers were gradually increased in the evaluation, and the labor enthusiasm of semi-able-bodied laborers was commended and encouraged. Liu Meiying and Xu Lihua in Wangjiayuan were originally rated at 7 points, but later increased to 9 points. After Wang Yingzhen was commended on the blackboard newspaper in Yanzhai, all the women in the village organized themselves. On the 20th, the cadres of each base point area held a meeting to summarize their experiences and called on all villages to learn: 1. Organize livestock to adjust to each other; 2. Organize manpower to dig the land to overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor; 3. All livestock should be used for plowing, and livestock should not be used for carrying or milling, and in the autumn land clearing, attention should be paid to discovering the various difficulties of poor peasants and impoverished military families and ways to solve them.

　　北园村人畜大变工
  　解决贫雇垡地困难
    【本报太岳二十七日电】沁源北园村王昌互助大队，在组织突击秋垡当中，发现五十八户贫雇和贫苦军干属缺乏畜力，无法秋垡。该村有一千八百五十四亩秋垡地，只有十九犋牲口，每犋牲口平均每天犁五亩，从十月十六日开始，到十一月初十地冻时，只能犁一千四百二十五亩，还有四百五十九亩秋地就不能秋垡，五十八户贫雇和军干属就有四百四十多亩，这样就轮不到犁，就是有牲口户，也因支前参战缺人犁地，假如不加以组织调剂，该村秋垡是成问题的。该村互助大队遂于十六日召开群众大会，讨论解决这一问题，大家议定把其中最困难的十五户贫雇和贫苦军属的一百零八亩四分秋地，无代价的犁过，所用的工，统统以优军工计算，其余四十三户无畜力的，用人畜变工或出工资的办法，也要垡过，决定犁一亩地还十八分工，或出九升小米。于十六日开始把全村十九犋牲口组织起来，收一块犁一块，不管谁家的地，挨着犁过去。另外，在打完庄稼后，组织全村一百零九个（内有八十九个半劳力已折合四十四个全劳力）男全劳力突击刨地，平均每人每天刨七分，一天即可刨七十六亩三分，这样，牲口犁不了的四百五十多亩地，用人力六天就可刨完，即使人数不能完全参加，在十一月中旬地未冻前也可刨完犁完。
    【本报太岳二十七日电】沁源一区收完五万余亩庄稼后，十五日开始组织三百余犋牲口垡地，五天内已垡秋地三千五百余亩，据该区区长谈：阴历九月底即可全部垡完。他们为什么能收的快垡的早呢？首先是把一切妇女儿童老汉都组织起来了，具体分工，发挥了力量。鹿儿回基点八个村，秋收秋种时，组织起一百个互助组，共一千四百七十一人，比春季扩大一倍多。鹿儿回本村虽走了二十六个参战民工，但在李玉龙大队及王爱源组的三十个妇女参加抢收下，十天割完所有庄稼。胡舍则之组孤寡还参加了互助组。霍登村五十五岁的老太太，与儿媳轮流参加互助组。各村都是老汉掌犁做手头活，妇女儿童割，青年人担，适当的各人发挥了各人的力量。其次是实地检查，区干部配合村干部，村与村及时进行互相评判，发扬优点，初步评了等级，大大推动了秋收秋垡。在检查中发现牧花园收的快，半月地净场光。王家园随收随犁，已垡地三百亩，北园村王昌大队节省畜力犁地，组织全半劳力刨地，解决贫雇及贫苦军属无畜力秋垡的困难。学孟村组织全村人畜力，由村边向外，不管谁家，挨一块垡一块，每晚记工评分，大家都说是好方法。全区经检查后，即把这些村子评为一等，并将优点介绍给各村，这样推动了落后的河西、董家、南祀等村，如董家在检查后，第二天就有五犋牲口垡地。再次是在评分上逐渐提高了半劳力的分数，表扬鼓励了半劳力，巩固了半劳力的劳动情绪。王家园刘美英、续里花等原评七分，后增加为九分；阎寨在黑板报上表扬了王英贞后，全村妇女就都组织起来了。二十日各基点区干部开会，总结经验后，号召各村学习：一、组织畜力互相调剂；二、组织人力刨地，克服劳力不足的困难；三、所有畜力全部犁地，牲口不作驮脚、碾面等工作，并在秋垡中注意发现贫雇及贫苦军属各种困难，设法予以解决。
