Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. Moscow Radio broadcast an article by commentator Ma Xinu on October 10th entitled "On the Double Tenth Festival." The text is as follows:

	Thirty-six years ago, a revolution broke out in China, and the Republic of China was established and produced. Since then, every year on the Double Tenth Festival, the Chinese people routinely summarize the path they have traveled. The Xinhai Revolution was a democratic movement of great significance, its purpose being to overthrow the autocratic Qing Dynasty and to overthrow the rule of imperialism (while the Qing Dynasty was essentially a running dog of imperialism). If the Xinhai Revolution could not achieve this goal, the Chinese people could not obtain independence and freedom. Although the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, the rule of feudal forces continued to exist, and the imperialists were still preserved. However, the direct goal of the Xinhai Revolution was considered achieved. The Qing Dynasty system, which ruthlessly devastated the Chinese people for two hundred and sixty-seven years, was overthrown. Although this system had the active support of Chinese feudal lords and the extensive help of imperialist powers, they finally came to a dead end. The overthrow of the Qing government was a matter of great significance. A year ago, the Liberation Daily wrote: The people who were cursed as "bandits" and "rebels" by the Qing Dynasty were victorious. The newspaper also said: The celebration of Double Tenth will forever strengthen our confidence that all invaders and their running dogs of the Chinese nation are bound to fail, and the movement for China's independence and freedom is bound to triumph. Thirty-six years have passed since then, which has been a period of continuous struggle for patriotic and democratic forces against internal reactionary forces and resistance against foreign invaders. The Chinese reactionaries who overthrew the Qing Dynasty and seized power actually continued to implement the Qing Dynasty's policies, that is, the policy of destroying democracy and betraying national interests. In addition to the Northern Warlords who replaced Wu Sangui, Zeng Guofan, and Li Hongzhang, there was later a Wang Jingwei. They lived in different eras, but they had one thing in common: they hated their own people and surrendered to the Japanese invaders in exchange for help in destroying China's democracy. The foreign invaders (i.e., Japanese imperialism) extensively used traitors. They had decided to re-establish their rule in China after the Qing Dynasty. They believed that they could achieve their goal by using the method of "controlling China with Chinese." Previously, Wu Sangui and other feudal warlords opened the gates of China for the Qing Dynasty and helped them seize vast territories of China empty-handed. The Japanese invaders believed that among the Kuomintang reactionaries, there were people like Wu Sangui who would open the gates of China for them and help them seize China empty-handed. Their calculation on the Kuomintang reactionaries was accurate.

	However, Japan miscalculated the Chinese people. Japanese imperialism was much stronger than the Qing Dynasty, and their running dogs in China were more numerous than before; but at this time, major changes had taken place in China, and the development of the Chinese people's national awakening consciousness produced and consolidated their patriotic forces. However, the most important thing is that the patriotic and democratic forces of the Chinese people have gained a strong pillar - the establishment of the Communist Party of China. The CPC ascended the stage of history at a time when the powerful Japanese imperialism threatened China's survival. From the first day of its birth twenty-six years ago, the CPC has expressed that they are the vanguard in the struggle for freedom and independence for the Chinese people, the encourager and organizer of this struggle. Sun Yat-sen, the great teacher of the Xinhai Revolution and the Chinese people, encouraged communism and its role. Although the CPC was very young when he was alive, he saw that the CPC was a fighter for the cause of peace and democracy, the main force of the national revolution, and the vanguard of the workers and peasants. Therefore, he formed a new alliance with the CPC and instructed the Kuomintang he founded to sacredly preserve this alliance. The CPC realized Sun Yat-sen's hopes for them. When the leadership of the Kuomintang was seized by reactionaries and his doctrine was abandoned, the CPC took the cause of implementing the Three People's Principles into their own hands. The reason why the CPC took this step was because they believed that this doctrine was suitable for the people's demands and suitable for completing the cause of the national revolution. Sun Yat-sen's proposition is in line with the struggle for national liberation and the struggle to destroy feudal oppression. The establishment of a civil rights system is in line with the patriotic movement and the democratic movement. The CPC specifically implemented all of this. They raised the patriotic and democratic movement to an unprecedented level, united all patriotic forces into a united front, carried out a war of resistance against the Japanese invaders, carried out a broad democratic revolution, and at the same time implemented Sun Yat-sen's principle of land to the tillers. All of this bankrupted the imperialists' plans. It took the Chinese people two hundred and sixty-seven years to overthrow the oppression of the Qing Dynasty; and in the struggle against the oppression of the powerful Japanese invaders, it only took fourteen years (of which eight years were during the large-scale war of resistance), and Japan collapsed. But before the Chinese people could gain freedom and independence, a new force of aggression appeared, namely, the ambitious expansionists of the United States. They also intend to rule China by means of "controlling China with Chinese." In order to achieve this goal, they are using the Kuomintang reactionaries to provoke civil war and oppose the patriotic movement, as has happened repeatedly in the past. The Kuomintang reactionaries have once again opened the gates of China for the ambitious people of foreign bosses, and have exchanged their help in stubbornly resisting the democratic forces, so as to present national sovereignty to their foreign bosses and sell all of China's underground wealth to them.

	But now the situation in China has changed greatly. When the United States expanded in China, the Chinese people's level of awakening was even higher than before. The efforts to consolidate, unite, and organize democratic forces have been incomparably improved compared with the time of the Japanese invasion. The Chinese patriotic forces that have increased to this point have gained a strong pillar, the powerful armed force of the anti-imperialist liberation struggle, the People's Liberation Army. The situation of opposing foreign aggressors has undergone fundamental changes. Since the United States began to expand in China, it has only been two years, and the Chinese people's armed forces have smoothly launched a major counteroffensive against the Kuomintang reactionary army armed and trained by the United States. The Kuomintang recently clamored for the so-called "final stage of the national revolution." Indeed, the Chinese democratic national revolution is completing its final stage. China's national rejuvenation is the elimination of the final external threat to the ambitious expansionists of the United States. Objective factors are favorable to the democratic forces striving for peace, independence, and freedom. The banner of defending national independence and national sovereignty is firmly grasped in the strong hands of the Communist Party of China, which has been tested for twenty-six years. Under this banner, all democratic and patriotic people are being mobilized and united. Chinese patriotic forces are showing their advantage everywhere in the vast areas of Central China, Northwest China, and Northeast China, showing an advantage over the anti-democratic and reactionary forces supported by the American bosses. The defeat of the reactionary army is the defeat of the ambitious expansionists of the United States, and it is also the guarantee of the victory of the democratic cause that is about to come.

　　评双十节
    马西努
    【新华社陕北十五日电】莫斯科广播电台于十月十日广播评论员马西努“评双十节”一文，原文如下：
    三十六年前在中国爆发了革命，并成立与产生了中华民国。自从那时起，每年双十节中国人民照例总结自己所走过的道路。辛亥革命是有着重大意义的民主运动，他的目的是推翻满清专制，和打倒帝国主义的统治（而满清实质上是帝国主义的走狗）。辛亥革命若不能达到这种目的，中国人民就不能得到独立与自由。满清虽被推翻，但封建势力的统治还在继续存在，而帝国主义者也还保存着。然而，辛亥革命直接的目的算是达到了的，在二百六十七年内无情摧残中国人民的满清制度被推翻了。这个制度虽然有中国封建主积极拥护与帝国主义列强广泛的帮助，但是他们终于走向了死路。终于推翻满清政府，这件事情有着非常重大的意义。一年前解放日报曾经这样写道：被满清咒骂作“匪类”和“乱党”的人民，却获得了胜利。该报又说：双十的庆祝，永远坚定我们的信心，即对中华民族的一切侵略者及其走狗必然失败，而中国的独立自由运动必然胜利。从那时起，已过去了三十六年的光阴，这曾是爱国民主力量反对内部反动势力和反抗外寇侵略不断斗争的年代。推翻满清而把握政权的中国反动派，实际上曾继续实行满清的政策，即摧残民主与叛卖民族利益的政策。除了代替吴三桂、曾国藩、李鸿章等的北洋军阀外，以后又来了一个汪精卫，他们曾在不同的时代生活，但他们有一个共同点，即仇视本国人民，向日寇投降，以换得帮助来摧残中国的民主。外寇（即日本帝国主义）曾广泛的利用了汉奸，他们曾经决定再行继满清之后，在中国建立自己的统治权。他们认为利用“以华制华”的方法，就能够达到目的。以前吴三桂曾与其他封建军阀替满清打开了中国门户，并帮助他们空手占领了中国广大的国土。日寇曾认为在国民党反动派中，有和吴三桂同样的人来替他们打开进入中国的门户，和帮助他们空手来夺取中国。他们对国民党反动派所打的这样算盘，是被看准了的。
    可是，日本对中国人民却打错了算盘。日本帝国主义要比满清强大得多，而他们在中国的走狗也比以前的数目多得多；但在这时，中国已发生了重大的变动，中国人民民族觉醒意识的发展，产生了与巩固了他们的爱国力量。然而，最主要的就是中国人民爱国的民主力量，已得到了强大的支柱——成立了中国共产党。中共在登上历史舞台之时，恰好是强大的日本帝国主义威胁中国生存的危急关头。中共自二十六年前诞生的头一天起，就表示出他们是为中国人民争取自由与独立斗争中的先锋，是这种斗争的鼓励者和组织者。辛亥革命和中国人民伟大的导师——孙中山先生，曾鼓励了共产主义及其作用，虽然他在世时中共很年轻，但他曾看出了中共是保卫和平与民主事业的战士，是国民革命的主力，是工农群众的先锋。因此他和中共缔结了新同盟，并嘱咐了他所创立的国民党神圣的保存这个同盟。中共实现了孙中山对他们所抱的希望，当他逝世后，国民党领导机关被反动分子夺取，和他的学说被放弃时，中共曾把执行三民主义的事业，拿到了自己的手中。中共之所以采取这种步骤，就是因为他认为这个主义适合于人民要求，适合于完成国民革命事业。孙中山的主张，是和民族解放斗争与摧毁封建压迫斗争相符合的。建立民权制度，是与爱国运动和民主运动相符合的。中共具体的实行了这一切。他们将爱国民主运动提高到空前未有的程度，将一切爱国力量团结成统一战线，对日寇实行了反侵略的战争，实行了广泛的民主革命，同时实行了耕者有其田的孙中山的原则。这一切，使帝国主义的计划破产了。中国人民需要二百六十七年的工夫以便推翻满清压迫；而在反对强大的日寇压迫斗争中，只需要十四年（其中八年是在进行大规模抗战时期），日本就垮台了。但未及为中国人民获得自由与独立，便出现了新的侵略势力，即美国扩张势力的野心家。他们同样打算以“以华制华”的手段来统治中国。为达到这个目的，他们就利用国民党反动派挑起内战，反对爱国运动，正如从前屡次发生过的一样。国民党反动份子，重新替外洋老板的野心家打开了中国门户，并换得了其对民主力量顽抗的帮助，以便将民族主权呈交给其外洋老板，将中国一切地下财富卖给他们。
    但是现在中国局势已大大的改变了。在美国在华扩张时，中国人民的觉醒程度已更加比以前提高了。巩固、团结与组织民主力量的努力，和日寇侵略时相比，已不可比拟的提高了。增涨到这时的中国爱国力量，已得到了强大的支柱，反帝国主义解放斗争的强大武装力量人民解放军，反对外国侵略者的局势已起了根本变化。自从美国在华开始扩张以来，只经过两年工夫，而中国人民武装力量就顺利的展开了大反攻，反对美国武装起来与训练出来的国民党反动军队。国民党于不久以前曾经叫嚣所谓“国民革命最后阶段”。的确，中国民主民族革命正在完成其最后阶段。中国民族复兴，即是对美国扩张势力野心家们的最后的外部威胁的清除。客观因素是对争取和平、独立、自由的民主力量有利的。保卫民族独立和国家主权的旗帜，牢牢的把握在经过二十六年考验的中国共产党强有力的手中。在这个旗帜下，正在动员与团结一切民主爱国的人民。中国爱国力量在华中、西北、东北广大的地区内，到处都表示出自己的优势，表示出超过美国老板所拥护的反民主的反动军队力量之上的优势。反动军的失败，就是美国扩张势力野心家的失败，也正是将要到来的民主事业获得胜利的保障。
