　　Troops and Merchants Contribute Labor and Livestock
  　Helping the Masses Harvest and Plant
    [This Newspaper News] The Garrison Regiment of the Military Region stopped speaking bitterness, drills, and office work. All commanders and fighters were mobilized to launch a harvest assistance campaign in their garrison area. Before dawn, Liu Liangui, the village anti-Japanese war support director, shouted into the loudspeaker: "Tell everyone the good news, comrades are helping us with the autumn harvest! Quickly eat breakfast, and participating households and military families should take sickles and carrying poles to the cooperative entrance to pick up people!" After breakfast, people asking for help and those offering help crowded the cooperative entrance. Mother Yu, a military family member, proudly held six sickles and said: "Little Yu joined the army alone, look, how many people are coming to help. You must write a letter to tell him to settle down and fight against Old Chiang!" An old man saw Director Gao also going to cut grain and asked, "Director Gao, are you also going to produce?" Gao said, "I'm cutting it for myself. Our food and clothing all come from the masses, why shouldn't I go?" The old man had nothing to say. With enthusiastic help, all the grain in the village was cut down. According to statistics from one unit of the Sixth Company, in three days, 140 laborers participated, helping to harvest 210 mu. They are now preparing to rush to harvest corn.

    [This Newspaper Taihang News] The First Sub-district Transportation Team saw that the masses in the village were planting wheat and lacked livestock, while their own livestock were resting. They could draw some out to help the masses plant wheat, so they announced to the masses: Whoever lacks it can come and lead them. The masses welcomed this very much. Some used them for plowing, some for planting wheat, and some for hauling manure. With livestock, the masses were more motivated to cultivate and plant, and they quickly planted the wheat. Now, except for the land where crops are still growing, most of it has been planted. Old man Liu Laoxiang said: "If it weren't for this livestock, our village's wheat wouldn't be planted by the end of the month." (Du Siyuan)
    [This Newspaper Neiqiu News] Under the call of the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, merchants in the entire town voluntarily signed up to help military families in the four streets of the town with autumn harvest and wheat planting. In four days, they provided 115 laborers, harvested 34 mu of grain, dug up 44 mu of sorghum, dug up 23 mu of grain stubble, pulled 3 mu of sesame, dug up 14 mu of corn, cut 6 mu of kidney beans, planted 20 mu of wheat on flat land, and trimmed 4 mu of sorghum, spreading manure on more than 3 mu, for a total of 151 mu.

　　部队商人抽出劳畜力
  　帮助群众收种
    【本报讯】军区警卫团停止诉苦、操课、办公，指战员一齐出动，在驻地展开助收运动。天不亮，村抗勤主任刘连贵便在喇叭筒子里叫着：“告诉大家个好消息，同志们帮咱秋收哩！赶快吃了清早饭，参战户和军属都拿镰担，到合作社门口领人哩！”一到早饭后，合作社门口要人的、帮收的挤成一堆。军属小余的娘，拿着六把镰刀洋洋得意的说：“小余的一个人参军了，瞧，有多少人来帮助，可要写信告诉他，要安心打老蒋哩！”一个老汉看见高主任也去割谷，问：“高主任，你也去生产？”高说：“我是给自己割哩，吃穿都是群众的，为啥不去呢？”老汉没啥说了。在热烈的帮助下，全村的谷子，全部割倒了。据六连一个单位的统计，三天参加劳力一百四十个，助收二百一十亩，现在正准备突击收玉茭。
