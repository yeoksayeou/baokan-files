Hinterland Supports Border Areas
  Jiaozuo Rushes to Harvest and Plant
  [Report from this newspaper, Jiaozuo] The Jiaozuo militia armed to protect the autumn harvest, achieving successive victories. On the afternoon of the 27th, an enemy machine gun squad came to Nan Gou Village to seize grain, but militia captain Liu Wang led two militiamen, holding out for half an hour, repelling the enemy, and recovering a livestock animal. On the 26th, over three hundred enemies went to the Yang Zhuang area to seize grain; upon pushing open a door, two were blown up. They dared not enter Qi Xin Village. On the 27th, over a thousand enemies prepared to go up the mountain to seize grain; in Xu He, upon seeing a grain jar, they went to lift it, but the landmine under the jar went off, and two more fellows were blown up. Preliminary statistics show that in three days, the enemy stepped on twenty-nine landmines, killing four and wounding nineteen. The masses happily said, "Landmines are fiercer than a company of men; it fears no number of enemies."
  Furthermore, regarding the hinterland's support of the border areas, Da Xiaozhai in the first district helps Da Bei Zhang and Li Wan villages on the border to rush the harvest, with militiamen standing guard and providing cover in the villages. The masses of each village have temporarily organized large-scale mutual aid. Da Bei Zhang has organized an autumn harvest cover team, a rush harvest team, and a rush transport team, and the entire village is operating like a machine, harvesting one hundred and forty mu in a single day.
  The main experience in the movement is resolving the masses' ideological concerns and uniting to work together. For example, in the border village of Li Wan, at the beginning of the autumn harvest, the masses worried that letting people from other villages transport the grain would cause chaos. After discussion, it was explained that people from other villages were helping with the harvest, and whoever transported grain for whom would issue a slip, so there would be no chaos. The masses then happily said, "The world has changed greatly now; in the past, even if we asked for money to hire people, they wouldn't work for us." Ji Zhang Village in the first district used specific accounting and organization to resolve the four fears of the women (fear of the enemy seizing it, fear of not getting it back, fear of not having enough to eat, fear of no one taking care of sick children), and then they started to help each other. (Zhipeng)
  [Report from this newspaper, Bo'ai] The liberated Xiaqicheng militia, under the leadership of Captain Wang Chang'an, armed to protect grain and fields. The enemy attempted to sneak past our sentry posts three times in the deep of night, but were fiercely repelled by our brave militiamen. The resourceful militia captain Wang Chang'an, anticipating that the enemy would continue to launch sneak attacks, patrolled and laid ambushes every night. Around ten o'clock on the night of October 9th, over a hundred members of the Bai Shan Township miscellaneous troops, wearing black clothing, entered the village to seize grain. Upon seeing someone enter the village, Comrade Wang Chang'an immediately asked, "Which unit is this?" and told them to stand still. But they didn't stop and continued to advance. Comrade Chang'an, leading the militiamen, charged forward with their guns, bravely engaging the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, with the clang of knives and guns ringing out. In this tense situation, the enemy seized Wang Chang'an's bayonet. Wang forcefully thrust forward, and then shot the enemy. The enemy was finally repelled by our brave and staunch militiamen.
  One enemy was killed, and two bayonets were seized. Wang Chang'an and Comrade Zhu Baishu suffered only minor injuries. That night, the entire village went to express their sympathy and regards. (Li Ping, Fa Rong, Yu Wen, Wang Jin)

　　腹地支援边地
  　焦作抢收抢种
    【本报焦作讯】焦作民兵武装保秋，连获胜利。二十七日下午敌一个机枪班来南苟村抢粮，被我民兵队长刘旺带领两个民兵，坚持半小时，将敌击退，并夺回牲口一头。二十六日敌三百余人，到杨庄一带抢粮，一推门，炸倒二个，到启心村就不敢进村。二十七日敌千余人准备上山抢粮，在许河见一瓦缸粮就去端，缸下地雷开了花，两个家伙又被炸。初步统计，三日敌踏响雷二十九个，炸死敌四个，伤敌十九个，群众高兴的说：“地雷比一连人还凶，多少敌人它也不怕。”
    另在腹地支援边地上，一区大小寨帮助边沿大北张、李万二村抢收，民兵在村上放哨掩护。各村群众都临时组织大互助，大北张组织了掩护秋收队、抢收队、抢运队，全村象一盘机器似的动起来，一天就收一百四十亩。
    运动中的主要经验是解决群众思想顾虑互助起来干。如边地李万村，在秋收开始，群众怕外村运要乱了，经讨论说明外村人来帮助收，给谁运开谁条，不会乱，群众才高兴的说：“如今世道大变了，过去讨钱用人家也不给咱干。”一区冀张村用具体算帐与组织解决了妇女们的四怕思想（怕敌抢走，怕弄不回来，怕吃不上饭，怕小孩病了没人管）后，才互助起来。（志鹏）
    【本报博爱讯】翻了身的下期城民兵，在队长王长安同志的率领下，武装保粮保田。敌人曾三次深夜偷摸我岗哨，都被我英勇的民兵猛烈击退，机智的民兵队长王长安，预料敌人还会偷袭，每天晚上巡查埋伏，十月九号夜里，十点钟左右，有柏山乡杂牌队百余人，身着黑服，进村抢粮，王长安同志见到有人进村，即问“是那一部分？”叫他站着，他也不站，直往前来，长安同志带领着民兵，迎头端枪而上，英勇的与敌人肉搏起来，刀枪叮当。在此紧张的情况下，敌人夺住了王长安的刺刀，王吃力的往前一送，顺手给了他一枪，敌终被我英勇坚强的民兵而击退。
    计击毙敌人一名，夺得刺刀两把，王长安与朱柏树同志，仅负轻伤，当夜全村群众纷纷前往慰问。（李平、发荣、玉温、王金）
