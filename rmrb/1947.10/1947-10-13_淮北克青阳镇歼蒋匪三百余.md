　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 11th: Late-arriving news: On the evening of September 30th, the Huaibei Jiang anti-Japanese troops, in a seven-hour battle, captured Qingyang, an important town in Sixian County (70 li east of Sixian County). The local Chiang Kai-shek forces were mostly annihilated, and over 300 people were captured alive, including Chiang's District Chief Hou Duxiu and Su Weichuan. Eleven heavy machine guns were seized. On the same day, taking advantage of the victory, the enemy in four strongholds between Sixian and Suqian counties - Jin Suo Town, Gui Renji, and Chen Dazhuang in Siyang County, and Magongdian south of Sixian County, were forced to retreat. Another unit of our army east of Hongze Lake also cooperated with each other, forcing the enemy in Jiangba Town, an important stronghold of the Chiang Kai-shek army between Huaiyin and Baoying, to flee. The above five towns should now have been recovered by us.
