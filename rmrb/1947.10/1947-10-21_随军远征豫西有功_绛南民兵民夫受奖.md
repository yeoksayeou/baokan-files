[Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 14th Dispatch] The Jiangnan militiamen and civilians in the new Jinan district of Jiangnan followed a certain brigade of the Chen-Xie army on their southern expedition and resolutely completed their tasks. In addition to receiving a banner from a certain brigade with the inscription "Rendered Meritorious Service in the Expedition to Western Henan," the brigade also sent a special letter to the county to commend and thank them: "This time, the masses of your county who participated in the war left their hometowns and joined our unit in the great counter-offensive, embarking on an expedition to Western Henan. Along the way, they transported ladders and ammunition, and rescued the wounded on the front lines with utmost responsibility. They played a significant role in the great combat mission of liberating Western Henan. Now that they have victoriously completed their tasks and gloriously returned to their hometowns, in addition to presenting the banner of 'Rendered Meritorious Service in the Expedition to Western Henan,' we would like to extend our gratitude to all the cadres and masses of your county."
