　　Significant Progress in Telecommunications Work in the Past Six Months
  　Military Region Three Bureau Celebrates Achievements with Enthusiasm
  　Deputy Commander Teng Encourages Continuous Improvement of Skills
    [Our Dispatch] The Military Region Telecommunications Bureau Three recently held a celebration meeting for all directly affiliated units. The bright red Party flag fluttered on the rostrum. Red papers with the names of meritorious personnel, congratulatory letters, and stories of their deeds were displayed on the surrounding walls. Amidst enthusiastic applause, Comrade Lin Wei, Director of the Three Bureau, summarized the communications work since the start of the merit campaign. He said, "Thanks to everyone's efforts and the leading role of the 202 meritorious comrades, the work of the Three Bureau has made significant progress in the past six months. Our Materials Assembly Section and factory, with everyone's continuous processing, averaged more than thirteen hours of work per day. Some comrades created a record of working continuously for 31 hours, exceeding the work plan by 100 percent. The Communications School created a '100 percent movement,' making all faculty and students active and engaged, exceeding the education plan and requirements. Each radio station established a merit book, and they were universally responsible and conscientious in their work. Comrade Chu Songqing often worked the night shift without any fatigue. Comrade An Zhensheng showed infinite patience in educating trainees. Many communications soldiers shortened the nine-day journey to five days, with a highest record of traveling 18 li per hour. Comrades Song Yuhou and others from the Communications Telephone Team went to the deep lines near Anyang. In addition to completing their tasks on time, they also automatically collected more than 500 jin of wire near the original Chiang Kai-shek bunkers. Quartermaster Jia Genquan traveled an extra 40 li to buy cheaper vegetables in order to save money, saving 40,000 yuan in one month. Almost all comrades completed a production task of 10,000 yuan in half a year." He especially mentioned, "Special-class meritorious Comrade Wang Shiguang and his partners were all very weak, but they insisted on working more than 13 hours a day. They showed infinite creativity in the establishment of the broadcasting station, the assembly of new machines, and the successful assembly of certain military equipment. Under extremely difficult material conditions, they achieved special-class achievements." He concluded, "This merit evaluation was generated through careful democratic elections. Meritorious comrades should not be complacent, but strive to add merit upon merit. Comrades who have not received merit should strive to achieve great merit next time. We must strive towards the direction of universal merit." After speaking, he announced the list of meritorious personnel, including special-class meritorious Comrade Wang Shiguang, first-class meritorious personnel Qian Wenji, Ding Gu, Chu Songqing, An Zhensheng, Xu Jinlin, Wang Sheng, Zhang Guangsheng, Ma Yugui, Chen Shiqing, and seventy-six others, and one hundred and twenty-six second-class meritorious personnel. Flowers were presented to the meritorious comrades amidst melodious music, and they were awarded "People's Meritorious Service" medals. At the same time, respect was paid to the comrades who had gone through the 25,000-li Long March, and flowers were also presented to them.
    Deputy Commander Teng, who attended in the midst of his busy schedule, and Minister Ren Baige of the Military Region Political Department and Propaganda Department also took the stage to speak. Deputy Commander Teng first extended cordial greetings and high respect to the meritorious comrades. He said, "Our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu People's Liberation Army has achieved brilliant results in the year and two months of self-defense warfare. In this process, our comrades on the communications front have completed their tasks, ensuring the smooth flow of communication for the troops and facilitating command. Whether it is wired or wireless communications work, as well as personnel from various departments related to communications, and the establishment of the Handan Broadcasting Station, all have played a very significant role and made great contributions to the self-defense war." Recalling the development process of the entire communications construction, Deputy Commander Teng pointed out, "After the Red Army crushed the enemy's encirclement for the first time in Jiangxi in 1929, we did not have a radio station at that time. Later, we kept a good one from the nearest radio stations, and then we began to establish wireless radio. Today, the communications troops in our district have developed to over tens of thousands of people, and the telephone network covers the entire region, with a total length of over 20,000 li. Hundreds of radio stations are working day and night. Although we are in a rural war environment, we can be proud of such great achievements. Our telegraphers are former soldiers and students who can go to work after a period of study. Some comrades have been serving in the communications department from the Red Army until today, and their contribution to the people is great. Especially under such difficult conditions today, being able to assemble such a large broadcasting station relies on the efforts of the assembly section comrades headed by Comrade Wang Shiguang. You have scientific knowledge, you have technology, we should learn from you, we thank you. Some bourgeois people know that we have no 'culture' and no 'knowledge,' but as long as the military equipment that the bourgeoisie can create, we can also create most of it, and it is no worse than them. Of course, we are not satisfied and must continue to work hard and improve." After praising the department's amazing production achievements in the past six months, Deputy Commander Teng encouraged everyone to improve their skills and step up their studies. He said, "Precisely because we are a scientific army, we must constantly improve our technology, strengthen politics, improve science, clarify our obligations, improve the quality of our work, complete the tasks assigned to each of you, and stand firmly on the position of serving the people, to meet the light, to meet victory!" Minister Ren Baige also gave the meeting encouragement and valuable instructions. Finally, representatives of the guests and meritorious personnel delivered speeches before the meeting adjourned.

　　半年来电信工作有显著进步
  　军区三局热烈庆功
  　滕副司令员勉励不断提高业务
    【本报讯】军区电讯三局直属各单位日前召开庆功大会，鲜红的党旗飘扬在主席台上，功臣名单、贺功信、功臣事迹的红纸招展在四周的墙壁上，在热烈的掌声中，三局局长林伟同志总结立功运动以来的通信工作。他说：“三局的工作由于大家努力及二百零二位功臣同志们的带头推动作用，半年来工作上有了极显著的进步，我们的材料装配科及工厂以大家不间断的加工，平均每天工作在十三小时以上，有的同志创造了连续卅一小时的工作纪录，超过工作计划百分之一百。通讯学校创造百分运动，使得全校员生个个积极紧张，超过了教育计划与要求。各电台建立了功劳簿，对工作普遍的负责认真，褚松青同志常常整夜值班毫无倦容，安振声同志对见习员教育更表现了无限的耐心。许多通讯员同志过去九天的路程缩短为五天，最高纪录每小时走十八里。通讯电话队宋玉厚等同志去安阳附近深线，除了按时完成了任务以外，还自动在原蒋匪碉堡附近收集了电线五百多斤。司务长贾根全同志为了节约，多跑四十里路去买便宜一点的菜，一个月便节约了四万元。全体同志差不多都半年完成了一万元的生产任务。”他特别说到“特等功臣王士光同志及其伙伴们身体都非常衰弱，而每天坚持十三小时以上的工作，对广播电台的建立、新式机器的装配及某种军事器械的装配成功，表现了无限的创造性，在物质条件十分困难的情形下，是有了特等成就的。”他最后说：“这次评功是经过慎重的民主选举的方式而产生的，功臣同志不要自满，要功上加功，没有立到功的同志要争取下次立大功，我们要向全体立功的方向去努力。”讲完后便宣布功臣名单，计有特等功臣王世光、大功钱文极、丁古、褚松青、安振声、徐金林、王生、张广升、马玉贵、陈士青等七十六人，及小功一百二十六人。在悠扬的乐声中向功臣同志们献花，赠“人民功臣”奖章；同时还向经过两万五千里长征的同志致敬，也向他们献花。
    在百忙中莅临的滕副司令员及军区政治部、宣传部任白戈部长也先后登台讲话。滕副司令员首先向功臣同志们致以亲切的慰问和崇高的敬礼。他说：“我晋冀鲁豫人民解放军在一年又两个月的自卫作战中，已取得光辉的战果，在这当中，我们通信战线上的同志们是完成了任务，保证了部队通信工作的顺畅，指挥如意，不论有线电、无线电等通讯工作，以及与通信部门有关的各部门人员，以及邯郸广播电台的成立，都起了非常重大的作用，对自卫战争的贡献很大。”回忆全部通信建设的发展过程，滕副司令员指出：“在一九二九年红军第一次在江西粉碎敌人的围剿后，当时我们还没有无线电台，以后从最近的电台中留下一部好的，那时我们才开始建立了无线电。今天我们这一个区的通讯部队已发展到×万余人，电话网密布了全区，全长达两万余华里。×百部电台中夜不停的工作着，虽然我们处在农村战争环境，我们能有这样大的成绩，是值得自豪的。我们的报务员是过去的战士、学生，经过一定时期的学习，就能上班了。有的同志，从红军一直到今天，都服务于通信部门，他们对人民的贡献是很大的。特别在今天这样的困难条件下，能够装配这样大的广播电台，就是依靠以王世光同志为首的装配科同志的努力。你们有科学知识，你们有技术，我们应向你们学习，我们感谢你们。若干资产阶级知道我们没有‘文化’，没有‘知识’，但是只要资产阶级能够造出来的军事器材，我们大部也可以造，并且不比他们坏。当然，我们还不满足，还要继续努力与提高。”滕副司令员于表扬半年来该部惊人的生产成绩之后，即勉励大家，提高技术，加紧学习。他说：“正因为我们是科学的部队，因而我们在技术上还要不断的提高，加强政治，提高科学，明确从义务从工作质量上提高，完成你们各人所负担的任务，并坚定的站在为人民服务的立场上，迎接光明，迎接胜利！”任白戈部长也给大会以鼓励及宝贵的指示，最后来宾代表及功臣代表分别致词后散会。
