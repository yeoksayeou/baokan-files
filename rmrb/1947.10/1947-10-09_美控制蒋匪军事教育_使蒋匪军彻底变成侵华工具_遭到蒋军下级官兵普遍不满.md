　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Comprehensive reports indicate that US imperialism is further expanding its control and "Americanization" of Chiang Kai-shek's military education institutions, as one of the main steps in the US's complete control and enslavement of Chiang's troops. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek, in accordance with US wishes, reorganized his highest military education institution, the Army University, in the style of the US "West Point Military Academy," which is a significant example. In addition, new Chiang Kai-shek military education institutions directly run by Americans are also being established. A Shanghai dispatch from the Associated Press on August 9th has confirmed this point, citing "Nanjing military sources" as saying that US military advisors in China are planning to establish a coastal defense school in Taiwan and a cavalry school in Tianshui, Gansu. According to Shanghai newspaper reports, while large-scale training of Chiang Kai-shek's army is underway in Taiwan, plans for US and Japanese officers to jointly train Chiang Kai-shek's air force and navy are also actively being pursued.

　　As early as during the Anti-Japanese War, the United States began its work of assisting Chiang Kai-shek in establishing Americanized military education institutions, in order to gradually gain control over Chiang's troops. It is known that the institutions established at that time included a staff training school, an infantry school, a Sino-American mixed air force school, two Sino-American joint army training schools, and five Sino-American special training classes. After the Japanese surrender, these schools continued to operate, and more new schools were established, including the Nanjing Automobile Training School, the Qingdao Naval Training School, the Kunming Signal Corps Training School, parachute training schools in Kunming, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Hengyang, the Chongqing Special Technician Training School, the Hangzhou Air Force Training School, the Chengdu Air Force School, and the Suzhou Mechanized School. In addition, according to General Lucas, head of the US Military Advisory Group in China, schools for training air force instructors and military technicians were also established in Hankou, Shanghai, Xuzhou, and other places. Lucas claimed that the infantry and artillery schools and mechanized schools in Nanjing and Suzhou had graduated 120 Kuomintang officers by the end of June this year. According to US Navy Admiral Barbey, the Qingdao Naval Training School had graduated three classes, each with 1,000 people, by December 1945. According to reliable sources, in the year from the Japanese surrender to September of last year, the United States trained a total of 140,000 to 150,000 military personnel for Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang on Chinese soil, including naval, air force, infantry, artillery, engineering, transportation, automobile, communications, paratrooper, secret service, traffic police, staff, military doctor, and quartermaster personnel. The US's work in assisting Chiang Kai-shek in establishing various military schools in China is closely coordinated with its plan to plunder Chinese military bases. The locations of most of the Americanized military schools are also the places where the US military has built or plans to build US military bases. For example, the recent US plan to establish schools in Tianshui and Taiwan to train Chiang Kai-shek's military personnel is precisely after Chiang Kai-shek agreed to sell Tianshui and Keelung and Taipei to the United States as military bases. The reorganized "Army University" was moved by Chiang to Shanghai, which is said to have the same intention.

　　In addition to training Chiang's military personnel on the ground in China, the United States also transferred a large number of Chiang's military officers and soldiers to the United States for training in the form of "studying in the United States." According to materials published by the "American Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy," 1,000 Chiang's naval officers and soldiers were trained in the United States from the Japanese surrender to July 1946. According to Shanghai newspaper reports, 960 naval personnel who had been trained in the United States returned to China last July with the "toy fleet" donated by the United States. According to Chiang Kai-shek's naval authorities, 2,000 air force personnel were sent by the Chiang government to the United States for training from the Japanese surrender to February 1946. According to recent reports in the Chiang area newspapers, Chiang Kai-shek's military personnel are continuing to be sent to the United States for training. At the beginning of last month, Chiang Kai-shek's naval headquarters recruited 70 naval officers in Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin, and Guangzhou to study in the United States; in early July, Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense recruited a large number of army officers of various services from all over the country to go to the United States for training (Tianjin Republic Daily, July 22); on August 4, 206 Chiang Kai-shek's military officers who were sent to the United States last year returned to Nanjing from the United States, and Chen Cheng said that they would be assigned to the front lines to participate in the work of slaughtering the Chinese people (Shanghai Central Daily, August 5); in April, 40 Chiang Kai-shek police officers arrived in the United States, 13 of whom were trained in the Detective Bureau of the Philadelphia Police Department, and the rest went to various specialized schools to study "police science." Up to now, the vast majority of officers and technical services in Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops have been trained in American technology and American spirit. US imperialism has actually initially completed the work of "Americanizing" Chiang Kai-shek's troops. The reason why US imperialism does not hesitate to spend huge sums of money and personnel to engage in the complex work of training Chiang Kai-shek's military personnel is, in addition to the purpose of controlling Chiang Kai-shek's army, originally hoped to help Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war, which serves the US's aggressive interests. However, after more than a year of civil war, these "Americanized" Chiang Kai-shek military personnel have largely become prisoners of the People's Liberation Army along with their troops, and many of them, after ideological awakening and changing their positions, are using their technology from the United States to serve the cause of the Chinese people's liberation against US imperialism and its running dogs. Even within Chiang Kai-shek's army, dissatisfaction with Chiang Kai-shek's "Americanization" policy has begun to emerge, especially the dissatisfaction of lower-ranking officers and soldiers, who are ashamed to wear American-style military caps, which is a manifestation of this feeling. According to a Ta Kung Pao report, in April of this year, when Chiang Kai-shek's Military Medical Department, in accordance with the intentions of the US Military Advisory Group, implemented the so-called "Military Medical Center Plan" and planned to merge the Shanghai Jiangwan Military Medical School into the "National Defense Medical College," it encountered resistance from the school's students and graduates, who organized a "School Protection Association" to resist the Chiang Kai-shek authorities' shameless plan to "Americanize" the school.

### 美控制蒋匪军事教育　使蒋匪军彻底变成侵华工具　遭到蒋军下级官兵普遍不满

　　美控制蒋匪军事教育
  　使蒋匪军彻底变成侵华工具
  　遭到蒋军下级官兵普遍不满
    【新华社陕北四日电】综合报导：美帝国主义正进一步展开控制和“美化”蒋匪军事教育机构的工作，作为美国彻底控制和奴化蒋匪军队的主要步骤之一。最近蒋介石按照美国愿望，仿效美国“西点军校”型式改组其最高军事教育机关陆军大学，即为一显著例子。此外，新的直接由美人主持的蒋匪军事教育机构亦在建立中，合众社八月九日上海消息已证实此点，该消息引证“南京军界人士”的谈话说，美国驻华军事顾问，正计划在台湾设立岸防学校，在甘肃天水设立骑兵学校。另据上海报纸消息，与在台湾大规模训练蒋匪陆军同时，由美国军官与日本军官共同训练蒋匪空军和海军的计划亦在积极进行中。
    远在对日战争期中，美国即开始其协助蒋介石建立美化军事教育机构的工作，借以逐渐取得对蒋匪军队的控制权。据知当时所建立的，包括参谋训练学校，步兵学校，中美混合空军学校，两个中美联合陆军训练学校，及五个中美特别训练班，日寇投降后，这些学校继续办下去，并建立更多新的学校，计有南京汽车训练学校，青岛海军训练学校，昆明信号部队训练学校，昆明、南京、广州和衡阳等地降落伞部队训练学校，重庆特别技师训练学校，杭州空军训练学校，成都空军学校，苏州机械化学校，南京步炮学校。此外，据驻华美军事顾问团团长鲁克斯称，在汉口、上海、徐州等地亦设有训练空军教官与军事技术人员的学校。鲁克斯宣称：南京与苏州的步炮学校和机械化学校，截至今年六月底，已有国民党军官一百二十人毕业。另据美海军上将巴贝尔称：青岛海军训练学校，至四五年十二月即已毕业了三班，每班一千人。据可靠方面材料，自日本投降，到去年九月的一年间，美国在中国地面即为蒋家匪帮训练了海、空、步、炮、工、辎、汽车、通讯、伞兵、特务、交通警察、参谋、军医、军需等军事人员，共计十四万到十五万人。美国协助蒋匪在华建立各种军事学校的工作，与其掠夺中国军事基地的计划密切配合，大多数美化军事学校的所在地，亦就是美军已建为或准备建为美军事基地的地方。例如最近美军计划在天水和台湾设立训练蒋匪军事人员的学校，即恰恰在蒋介石答应出卖天水和基隆、台北给美国作军事基地之后。改组后之“陆军大学”蒋移设上海，据云亦有此用意。
    美国除在中国地面就地训练蒋军人员外，并以“赴美留学”形式，将大批蒋军士官调至美国受训。据美国“民主远东政策委员会”发表材料，自日本投降起至一九四六年七月止，蒋党海军士官有一千人在美受训。据上海报纸消息，在美受训海军人员九百六十人已于去年七月随美国赠送之“玩具舰队”归国。另据蒋匪海军当局宣布，自日本投降至四六年二月止，蒋政府派往美国受训之空军人员达二千人。最近据蒋区报纸消息披露，蒋匪军事人员被遣赴美受训者正继续不断。上月初蒋匪海军总部即在京、沪、平、津、穗等地，招考留美海军军官七十名；七月上旬蒋匪国防部在各地招考大批陆军各种兵种军官赴美受训（七月二十二日天津民国日报）；八月四日蒋匪去年所派留美军官二百零六人由美返抵南京，陈诚表示即将彼等分派前线参加屠杀中国人民工作（八月五日沪中央日报）；四月间曾有蒋家警官四十名抵达美国，其中十三名在费城警务部侦探局受训，其余分赴各专门学校研究“警察学”。截至目前为止，蒋匪嫡系部队中士官及技术兵种，绝大部分已经受过美国技术和美国精神的训练，美帝国主义实际上已初步完成“美化”蒋匪军队的工作。美国帝国主义之所以不惜花费巨金和人员，从事训练蒋匪军事人员的复杂工作，除为控制蒋介石军队之目的外，原希望有助于为美国侵略利益服役的蒋介石反人民内战。但经过一年多的内战，这些“美化”蒋军人员已大批地随着的他们的部队成为人民解放军的俘虏，不少且经过思想觉悟和改变立场的，以其来自美国之技术，转而为反对美国帝国主义及其走狗为中国人民解放事业服务。甚至在蒋军内部亦已开始不满于蒋匪之“美化”方针，尤以下级官兵之不满更为显著，他们之耻于戴美式军帽，即为此一感情之流露。据大公报消息，今年四月间，蒋记军医署遵照美国军事顾问团意旨，实施所谓“军医中心计划”，拟裁并上海江湾军医学校为“国防医学院”时，即遭遇该校学员及所属毕业生之反抗，他们曾组织“护校会”，对抗蒋匪当局“美化”该校之无耻计划。
