Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Anhui-Hubei Front, 19th: The people of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei love the People's Liberation Army. Wherever the PLA went in counties such as Huangchuan, Shangcheng, and Gushi, the common people recalled the beautiful life of the Land Revolution era eighteen years ago. Men and women in their forties and fifties, upon seeing PLA soldiers, would talk endlessly about the agricultural associations and women's associations of the past. They were very familiar with the distribution of grain, land, and confiscated wealth, and the principle of "land to the tiller." After a certain PLA unit camped and slept peacefully in Fanyingzi Village, Gushi, Fan Shugui's mother (who was a member of the women's association during the Land Revolution) was so excited that she couldn't sleep all night. She quietly killed her beloved hen and asked the soldiers to eat it when they woke up. When the soldiers politely declined, she said with tears in her eyes: "Comrades, eat it! Our lives are connected! As long as we defeat these Chiang Kai-shek's yellow dogs, not to mention a chicken, the whole of China will be ours! For more than ten years, you've been gone so far away, and the poor people here have been oppressed to death by the yellow dogs!" A large number of forced laborers captured by Chiang Kai-shek's 58th Division in Gushi County fled in groups under the intense artillery fire on the battlefield, helping the PLA to carry the wounded and transport grain. Wang Sanhui, a 50-year-old laborer, patted his chest and said: "I am willing to die of exhaustion to carry for our own comrades; but I am not willing to carry a single liter of grain for them (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's army)." Zhu Da, a 19-year-old laborer, cried and said: "I have been working as a farmhand for others for five or six years, and the shopkeeper didn't pay me. He said that I used his coffin when my mother died, but even the neighbors didn't know about it. I want to help our army quickly defeat Chiang Kai-shek and go back to settle accounts with the shopkeeper."

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 19th: Hankou News: Amidst the victorious advance of the southward People's Liberation Army, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Wuhan are panicking. A curfew has been imposed in the city every night from 8:00 PM. Bunkers have been built on all streets, and obstacles such as sandbags and barbed wire are everywhere. Chiang Kai-shek's officials and all wealthy merchants have sent their families to the south bank in order to escape alone at any time. Funds are fleeing to Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and other places. Prices have soared to unprecedented levels. White rice has risen from around 200,000 yuan (Chiang currency, same below) per shi to 350,000 yuan. Even the cheapest Chinese cabbage sells for 1,200 yuan per catty. Gold has risen from 2.3 million yuan per tael to 3.5 million yuan. The prices of other daily necessities have doubled or increased by 1.5 times. The people are trapped in a desperate situation. According to the bandit side's statistics, the number of unemployed people in the city has reached 420,000, and the actual figure is over 600,000.

　　回忆土地革命时代美满生活
  　中原人民热爱解放军
    【新华社鄂豫皖前线十九日电】鄂豫皖人民热爱解放军。在潢川、商城、固始等县解放军所到之处，老百姓便回忆起十八年前土地革命时代的美满生活。四五十岁的男女们，一见解放军战士，便滔滔不绝谈起从前的农会和妇会的故事。他们对分粮、分田、分浮财、耕者有其田都很熟悉。解放军某部在固始范营子村，于夜半宿营安睡之后，范书贵的母亲（她在土地革命时代是妇会会员）兴奋的彻夜不眠，并悄悄杀了自己心爱的母鸡，叫战士们醒来吃，当战士们婉言谢绝时，他含着眼泪说：“同志们吃吧，咱们的命是在一条线上串着的呀！只要把蒋介石这些黄狗们搞垮，不要说一只鸡，就是全中国也是咱的呀！十几年啦，你们走的老远老远，咱们这里的穷人可叫黄狗压迫死了！”蒋匪五十八师在固始们县抓的大批的民工，在战场上激烈的炮火下成群的逃跑过来，帮助解放军抬伤员，运粮食，五十岁的民工王三会拍着胸膛说：“抬咱们自己的同志，我情愿累死也不怨；可是我不愿替他们（指蒋匪军）扛一升粮食。”十九岁的民工朱达哭着说：“我给人家当长工五六年啦，掌柜不给我工钱，他说我娘死的时候用了他的棺材，但这件事连邻居也不知道呀。我要帮助咱队伍赶快打垮蒋介石，回去和掌柜的算帐。”
    【新华社中原十九日电】汉口消息：在南下解放军胜利进军之中，武汉蒋匪慌张。每晚八时起全市即实行戒严，各街头广筑碉堡，并满布沙袋及铁丝网等障碍物，蒋匪各机关官员以及一切富商巨贾均纷纷将眷属送往南岸，以便随时只身逃跑。资金纷纷逃避京沪及广州、香港等地。物价则空前暴涨，白米已由每市石二十万元（蒋币、下同）左右上涨至三十五万元，即连最便宜的小白菜每斤亦卖到一千二百元，黄金更由每两二百三十万元上涨至三百五十万元，其他生活必需品均上涨一倍至一倍半不等，人民陷于生活绝境。据匪方统计，全市失业人数已达四十二万，实际数字在六十万以上。
