  　In Some Villages of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region,
  　Village Cadres Are Undemocratic and Farmers Are Greatly Dissatisfied
    [Report from this newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 8th] After three re-examinations and major movements in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region, a vigorous mass movement has taken shape in most areas. However, in some villages, the poor and lower-middle peasants have not truly turned over, and the countryside is controlled by a few village cadres. Farmers dare not speak, and democracy and freedom are nominal. In Baimawai Village, Qingfeng Fourth District, the masses are not very enthusiastic about struggling against landlords, but they have many opinions about the cadres. The reason for this is that the village cadres are undemocratic and divorced from the masses. They believe that they have contributed to the struggle in the village and are dissatisfied with the poor peasants holding power. They are unreasonable in the distribution of fruits of victory and cannot meet the demands of the poor peasants. For example, when the village distributed the fruits of victory, it was auctioned at a discounted price according to three classes and nine grades. The discounted price was very high, and the poor peasants could not afford it, so the good things fell into the hands of the middle peasants. Yang Xinyue, a poor peasant in the village, had to beg for food at the age of twelve and remained a bachelor all his life. He only received more than three dou of wheat and two stalks of grain in the spring. The poor peasant Yin Yu was ranked as a second class and only received a piglet in the spring. Village cadres embezzled the fruits of victory, gave them away, and made arbitrary decisions on village affairs, without adopting the opinions of the masses. The landlords took advantage of the lackeys to sow discord, which made the poor peasants even more dissatisfied with the village cadres, and the village cadres became more and more isolated. The cadres of Liuzhuang Village in Changyuan collectively embezzled, secretly distributing the grain owned by the masses at night. The money and grain from the struggle against the landlords were worth about 100,000 yuan, but they were not distributed to the masses. The masses of Tunzhuang Village in Kunwu Seventh District proposed: "Last time we recovered eight qing of land from the landlords, everyone harvested the crops and threshed the grain, but we didn't get any of it. We don't know where it went." The above phenomena must arouse the serious vigilance of the leadership and require in-depth examination. Only then can the re-examination movement truly penetrate the masses and further improve the re-examination movement. Letting go of democracy and truly letting the masses be masters of their own affairs is the central key to the current work.

　　冀鲁豫部分村庄
  　村干不民主农民大不满
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】冀鲁豫经三次复查大动之后，大部地区已形成轰轰烈烈的群众运动，但尚有部分村庄贫苦群众并未真正翻身，农村在少数村干的控制下，农民不敢说话，民主自由有名无实。清丰四区白马歪村群众对斗地主劲头不大；而对干部却意见很多。检查原因，即为村干部不民主，脱离群众，认为自己在本村坚持斗争有功，对贫农掌权不满，在分果实上不合理，不能满足贫农要求。如该村在分果实时，按三等九级折价拍卖，折价很高，贫农买不起，好的东西都落到了中农手里。该村贫农杨新月十二岁就要饭，打一辈子光棍汉，一春天只分了三斗多麦，两条槁，贫农银浴列了个二等，一春天只分了个小猪；村干贪污果实，将果实送人，对村里工作独断，不采纳群众意见，地主即利用狗腿从中挑拨，以致造成贫农对村干更加不满，而村干则愈形孤立。长垣刘庄村干部则集体贪污，将群众所有的谷子偷偷地在夜间私自分了，斗争地主的款和粮食约值十万元，也没有分给群众。昆吾七区屯庄群众提出：“上次收回地主八顷地，大家下手收的庄稼，打的粮食没分到，不知弄到那里去了。”以上现象，必须引起领导上的严重警惕，深入检查，则复查运动才能真正深入群众，将复查运动更加提高一步，而放手民主，真正让群众自己当家，则是目前工作的中心关键。
