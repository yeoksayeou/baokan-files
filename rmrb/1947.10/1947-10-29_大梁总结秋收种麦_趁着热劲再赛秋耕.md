　　Daliang Sums Up Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting
　　Capitalizing on Momentum to Compete in Autumn Plowing Again
    [Report from Neiqiu by our newspaper] In Daliang Village, Fifth District, since the meeting on the evening of August 22nd (lunar calendar), discussing wheat planting, thanks to the leadership of the poor peasants and hired laborers, and the cadres and activists taking the lead and grasping it tightly, and the appropriate and rational allocation and organization of labor, they launched night plowing, night carrying, and night manure pushing, and proposed using threshing machines instead of oxen, and people pulling the seed drill while livestock plowed. By the 27th, they had completed the planting of wheat on all 1,099 mu of the village's land, and the autumn harvest, and the task of 10 jin of dried wild vegetables per person. On the 28th, a mass meeting was convened to summarize the village's autumn harvest and wheat planting, and more than ten active poor peasant and hired laborer backbones emerged, such as Hao Guizi and Tian Laoxin. Taking advantage of the masses' enthusiasm, the chairman of the farmers' association asked, what should we do after completing the wheat planting task? Fan Huqun proposed: "This year the rainfall is heavy, and the land is good. We must seize the time to plow the autumn fields and organize the 'chuan guo gai' (a major winter production activity in the village - making pot lids)." Cheng De, vice chairman of the farmers' association, said: "I agree with this idea. As they say, 'Autumn plowing scratches the skin, better than spring plowing with one plow.'" Group leader Fan Desheng said: "Early autumn plowing is as good as applying fertilizer. If autumn plowing is done early, every blade of grass will be buried in the ground. Even without applying fertilizer during the New Year, it's as good as a small application. This is the experience I've gained from working all my life." Tian Xiaocheng said: "Anyway, going through it once is refining it once. Whether or not the land is autumn plowed makes a big difference. In the 33rd year, on the same piece of land, my brother Changchun and I separated it. We planted it after a rain, and did the same work, except I didn't do autumn plowing. The next year, after plowing and planting in the spring, the seedlings didn't grow strong, and they weren't all there. As a result, when harvesting grain in the autumn, I got four dou per mu, while Changchun got eight dou per mu." Everyone unanimously recognized the importance of autumn plowing, clarified the division of labor, assigned special personnel to hold the plow, and freed up labor to make "chuan guo gai". Then they discussed how to combine autumn plowing with "chuan guo gai". Fan Laohan said: "There are few livestock and many people. We must select a skilled plowman for each usable livestock to hold the plow (the village has 35 usable livestock), and organize the remaining labor to make 'chuan guo gai' if they can, and sell 'chuan guo gai' and scrape Mao grass if they can't." Fan Desheng proposed to ensure that livestock and people are not idle. After everyone passed the above opinions, the village's 18 groups, with a total of 211 laborers, raised competition between groups. The conditions were: to see who could complete it the earliest, and make the most "chuan guo gai" based on people, livestock, land, and technology. Poor peasant and hired laborer Tian Huagui, in order to strive to complete it the fastest, started autumn plowing on the second night, and plowed four mu in one night before dawn. Taking advantage of the enthusiasm for wheat planting and the leadership of the poor peasants and hired laborers, a hot autumn plowing and "da fan guo gai" (making and selling pot lids) movement has been formed throughout the village. As of the summary on September 7th (lunar calendar), of the village's 2,130 mu of land, besides the 1,099 mu planted with wheat, the remaining 1,011 mu, excluding the radish, vegetables, red yam, and cotton that could not be harvested, 450 mu had been plowed, and only 110 mu had not been plowed. Their slogan is: "Guarantee to finish plowing before the big freeze, leaving no stubble field." (Neiqiu Joint Office)

　　大梁总结秋收种麦
  　趁着热劲再赛秋耕
    【本报内邱讯】五区大梁村自阴八月二十二日晚上开会，讨论种麦，由于贫雇领导，干部积极分子带头抓的紧，和适当合理的配备与组织使用了劳力，开展了夜耕、夜担、夜推粪，提出了套碾拉场不用牛，牲口耕地人拉耧，截至二十七日已完成全村一千零九十九亩的种麦，和秋收与每个人十斤干野菜任务。二十八日即召开了群众大会，总结了全村的秋收与种麦，涌现出郝贵子、田老欣等十余个积极贫雇骨干。农会主席趁着群众的热劲，又提出完成种麦任务后应当干些啥？范虎群提出：“今年雨水大，垧好，要抓紧秋耕地，和组织串锅盖（串锅盖是该村一种主要冬季生产）。”农会副主席成德说：“这个意见我赞成，常说：秋天刮破皮，赛过春天耕一犁。”组长范德胜说：“秋天早耕顶上粪。秋耕耕的早，叶叶草草都掩到地里了，过年不上粪，也顶个小遍垧，这是我做了一辈子活的经验。”田小诚说：“反正经一经，精一精，地秋耕不秋耕可有大关系，三十三年时同样一块地，我和俺长春（他兄弟）一下分开，一场雨种上，同样做作，就差我没秋耕，第二年春一犁种上以后，苗出来不发实，也不全苗，结果到秋天打粮食，我一亩合四斗，俺长春一亩就合八斗。”大家一致认识了秋耕的重要，明确分工，专人掌犁，腾出劳力串锅盖。接着又讨论了秋耕地与串锅盖怎样结合，范老汉说：“牲口少人多，把每一个能使的牲口要选出一个耕地把式掌犁（全村三十五个能使的牲口），下余劳力组织起来能串锅盖的串锅盖，不能串锅盖的贩锅盖，刮毛草。”范德胜提出要作到牲口不闲，人不闲手。大家通过了以上意见后，全村十八个组，正半辅共计二百一十一个劳力，组与组提出了竞赛，条件是：按人、按牲口、按土地、按技术看谁完成的早，串的锅盖多。贫雇田华贵，为了争取最快完成，第二夜里就秋耕起来，一夜耕完四亩天还不明。全村趁着种麦的热劲和贫雇的带头领导，已形成了热火朝天的秋耕打贩锅盖运动，截至九月初七总结，全村土地二千一百三十亩除种麦一千零九十九亩外下余一千零十一亩除去萝卜菜、红山药、棉花腾不下茬外，已耕完四百五十亩，只有一百一十亩未耕完，他们的口号是：“保证大冻前耕完，不留一亩茬地。”（内邱联合办公室）
