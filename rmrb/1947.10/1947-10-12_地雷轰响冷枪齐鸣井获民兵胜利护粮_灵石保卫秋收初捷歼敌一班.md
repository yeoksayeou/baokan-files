　　[This newspaper's report from Huolu] More than 200 members of the stubborn puppet forces and returning landlord "homecoming corps" from Nantongye, with more than 20 carts, came to our Sanzhai to loot grain on October 1st. The militia joint defense of our Sanzhai, Liangjiazhuang, and Shangquanliang villages in Jingxing resolutely defended the autumn harvest of the masses, repelling the enemy with cold shots and landmine warfare. Before the enemy arrived, the village cadres and militia of Shangzhai village organized the masses in advance to retreat in a planned manner when the enemy came, and then laid the mines. When the enemy entered Shangzhai village to loot, as soon as they entered the door of the militia team headquarters, the mine hanging there exploded, wounding one enemy soldier. When the enemy went to the well to draw water with buckets, the mine under the bucket exploded again, wounding two people.
　　Feng Guobing, a member of the "homecoming corps" from Nanzhai village, went home to move his saddle, and the mine blew his stomach open. Another stubborn soldier moved a white flour jar belonging to the common people, and the mine blew the jar and the man to pieces, and the white flour was covered with blood. Some fleeing landlords in Beizhai were still cutting grain in the field, and as soon as the landmine exploded, the villagers and militia launched cold-shot shooting, shouting "Charge!" The supporting militia from Shangquanliang village in Jingxing also arrived, creating an even greater momentum. Seeing the situation was not good, the enemy fled in panic, and the carts they brought also fled empty.
　　The main experiences of the victory are: understanding the enemy's situation and movement patterns in advance, organizing the masses to retreat in a planned manner, and then laying the mines, combined with cold-shot warfare, can lead to victory. (Xu Ting, Cong De)
　　[This newspaper's dispatch from Taiyue, October 10th] Lingshi achieved its first victory in armed defense of the autumn harvest, annihilating one enemy squad. Under the call of the county party committee, "Not allowing the enemy to rob a single grain," our 29th unit and the basic company's armed work team militia rotation team concentrated their forces and launched a war to defend the autumn harvest against the enemy. On the 24th, a battalion of Yan bandit's Provisional 45th Division and a special agent team in the city advanced towards the Shuiyu area in three routes, attempting to loot grain, but were severely attacked by our ambushing troops and fled in panic. We annihilated one enemy squad, capturing one small cannon, one machine gun, three rifles, and more than 70 rounds of ammunition.

　　地雷轰响冷枪齐鸣井获民兵胜利护粮
  　灵石保卫秋收初捷歼敌一班
    【本报获鹿讯】南铜冶的顽伪结合逃亡地主还乡团二百多人，带大车二十多辆，于十月一日到我三寨抢粮，我三寨、梁家庄及井陉上全梁等村的民兵联防，坚决保卫群众秋收，以冷枪地雷战，打退了敌人。在敌未来以前，上寨村干部及民兵预先组织群众，敌来时有计划的退却，然后将雷下上，敌人到上寨村里抢东西，刚入民兵队部的门，挂的雷响了，炸伤敌人一名；敌人到井台上提桶打水，桶下雷又响了，炸伤两人。
    南寨村的还乡团冯过兵到家搬鞍子，雷把他肚子也炸开了，又一顽军搬老百姓的白面缸，雷把面缸连人都炸碎了，白面上都是鲜血。北寨有的逃亡地主，还在地里割谷子，地雷一响，各村民兵展开冷枪射击，大喊冲锋，井陉上全梁村支援民兵也赶到，声势更大，敌人见势不好，仓惶逃窜，带来大车，也都空着逃窜了。
    斗争胜利的主要经验是：预先了解敌人情况和出动规律，组织群众有计划的退却，然后再按上雷，结合冷枪战，即能致胜。（绪亭、从德）
    【本报太岳十日电】灵石武装保卫秋收首次获胜，歼敌一个班。在县委“不让敌人抢走一颗粮”的号召下，我二九部队及基础连武工队民兵轮战队，即集中力量，与敌展开保卫秋收战争。二十四日，城内阎匪暂编四五师一个营与特务队，分三路向我水峪一带进犯，企图抢粮，当被我预伏部队予以严重打击，仓惶而逃。我共歼敌一个班，缴获小炮一门，机枪一挺，步枪三支，子弹七十余发。
