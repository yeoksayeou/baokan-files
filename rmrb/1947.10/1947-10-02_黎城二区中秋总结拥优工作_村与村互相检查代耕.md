[Reported by our newspaper from Licheng] On the ninth day of the eighth lunar month, all base points in the district held a civil affairs director meeting to review the work of supporting the army. First, the civil affairs director of each village introduced the situation of supporting the army in the village. Then, district cadres, in coordination with the civil affairs directors participating in the meeting, adopted the method of mutual inspection between villages, personally visiting the families of military personnel to inquire about the details of preferential treatment and how it should be carried out. As a result of this inspection, it was found that in the whole district, there were 13 households of military dependents with more than two plots farmed for every one plot of their own, 57 households with one plot farmed for every one plot of their own, 76 households with one plot farmed for every two plots of their own, 8 households with two plots farmed for every three plots of their own, 225 households with one plot farmed for every three plots of their own, 3 households with one plot farmed for every four plots of their own, and 42 households with no surplus plots farmed (belonging to landlord class); however, there were still individual villages that did not provide sufficient care for military dependents. For example, the wheat stubble of Zhang Futang, a cadre's family member in Zhangjiashan, was still growing in the field during the White Dew season, and in Dongbei Village, the wheat field of Comrade Song Weizhen, a cadre who went south, was only plowed twice by the Autumn Equinox. There were also many models of supporting the army. In Fengtuo Village this year, each family of military dependents applied an average of 30 loads of fertilizer per mu, and before each season, the entire youth self-defense force and militia would cut firewood for the military dependents. Zhang Yuxiang, a liberated farmer in Yannan, said: "There can be no rear without the front. Comparing others to oneself, neglecting military dependents is forgetting our roots." Now, the cadres of each village have made guarantees (covenants) to the military dependents: 1. In the future, they will guarantee that the military dependents' harvesting, plowing, and sowing will be done first, and the land will be deeply plowed and meticulously cultivated with more fertilizer applied; 2. If the land of military dependents is barren and the harvest is reduced, the substitute farming households will compensate them. Finally, all the cadres of each village will specifically divide the work and be responsible for taking care of several families of military dependents. Everyone decided to write letters to the soldiers at the front during the Mid-Autumn Festival, reporting on the liberation and preferential treatment of their families and soliciting the opinions of the soldiers at the front. Wang Yunpeng, a disabled veteran from Baogaojiao, said: "The counter-offensive is in full swing. I want to be self-reliant and refuse substitute farming." Li Haiwen, a 57-year-old military dependent from Taipei, said: "I can't forget the pain after the wound is healed. Chairman Mao told me to have good weather, but Chiang Kai-shek won't let us have good weather. No, not only will I not ask everyone to give me preferential treatment, but I will also give preferential treatment to the militia participating in the war, so that they can fight with peace of mind, kill Chiang Kai-shek, and have our good weather." (Written by Wang Huaibi, Central Communications Group of the Second District)

[Reported by our newspaper from Licheng] In order to further improve the work of supporting the army and truly ensure that military dependents have no difficulties in their lives, the Shiban base point in the Fourth District convened a meeting of village chiefs and civil affairs directors on the 21st to discuss and thoroughly summarize and review the military work of the past year. The discussion resulted in the following practices: (1) Through the Mid-Autumn Festival's support-the-army activities, combined with the start of the great counter-offensive, the 13th, 14th, and 15th days of the lunar month are designated as the week for supporting the army and resistance against Japan propaganda and education, extensively mobilizing the masses to recognize the importance of supporting the army and resistance against Japan work from the perspective of class consciousness. (2) Summarize the situation of farming three plots and leaving one for the military dependents household by household. The living standard cannot be lower than that of ordinary peasants. Conduct a mass inspection to determine whether the seedlings are hoed well, whether enough fertilizer is collected, and whether the autumn seedlings are growing well. Compare the grain yield per mu with that of ordinary peasants. The wheat field should be expanded to the same extent as ordinary peasants, or even exceed it. If fertilizer is lacking, organize fertilizer accumulation to make up for it, and conduct accounting to establish the idea that "production is automatic, and others are helpers." (3) Check whether the substitute farmed land can achieve the expected grain yield. If it cannot, the substitute farming groups and households should be held responsible and compensate for the original amount of grain (except for natural disasters) through mass discussion. (4) Respect military dependents and check whether there are cases of bullying and corruption involving the families of military cadres. If so, conduct democratic discussion and education based on the historical, behavioral, and degree of the offense, distinguishing between minor and major cases. (5) Convene separate forums for farmers and military dependents to solicit opinions on whether there are any difficulties in their lives and solve them if there are. If there is a relationship with landlords, they should be enlightened with class consciousness to separate from the landlord class. Convene forums for landlord family members who resist Japan to make them realize the past crimes of the landlord class in oppressing peasants and to thoroughly bow their heads to the peasants. Through summary and inspection, various models are selected and various banners are established. Currently, each village is conducting in-depth inspections. (Chongqi)
