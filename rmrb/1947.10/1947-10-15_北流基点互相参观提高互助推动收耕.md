Beiliu Base Points Visit Each Other to Improve Mutual Assistance and Promote Autumn Harvesting
[Our newspaper, Licheng News] On October 2nd, the Beiliu Base Point in the Second District held an expanded cadre hero meeting for the entire base point. Heroes from various villages proposed organizing visiting teams to exchange labor, share experiences, and improve mutual assistance. For example, the eight people from Lubao who attended from Beiliu Village were all heroes and active in production. They participated in mutual aid groups in other villages, one person per group, to learn through practical work. Each group of eight selected a leader and deputy leader to exchange information at night. The content of the visits mainly included exchanging labor for equal value, deep plowing and meticulous work, agricultural techniques, the combination of agricultural and sideline production with war support, leadership in carrying out movements, and care for the families of soldiers and martyrs. After the visits, they tried their best to summarize and learn from the experiences through the masses, and put forward suggestions for improving the future work of other villages. Lu Jianghe, a hero from Lubao Village, said: "The people in Beiliu have great enthusiasm for their work, like a fire being stoked. Every movement is based on the masses defining accurate plans from the bottom up, not cadres doing everything themselves. For example, the group of hero Li Wendu truly achieves working according to the task, rationally using labor and livestock, rewarding good labor in a timely manner, and summarizing and commending according to the season. We must learn this approach when we go back." A summary of the 21 mutual aid groups in Beiliu Village, especially the eight model mutual aid groups such as those of heroes Li Wendu and Zhao Jiliang, showed they were able to provide mutual assistance year-round, and the combination of agricultural and sideline production with war support was also good. The exchange of labor for equal value was based on the task, and deep plowing and meticulous work were achieved. Whenever it was time to sow, weed, or fertilize, they always prioritized the families of soldiers and martyrs in everything. The nine general groups, such as that of Liu Lantian, were very good at agricultural mutual assistance, but the combination of the three aspects was relatively poor. There were also four formalistic mutual aid groups, such as that of Duan Shusheng, who met together, but only exchanged labor for a few days when they were too busy. Generally, they took care of their own affairs. Duan Fude's group had participated in mutual aid work for only one and a half days since the spring. Liu Tucheng's group cultivated wasteland for Li Piye, a cadre who went south, and the land was neglected. Zhang Liankui, chairman of the Beiliu Farmers' Association, said: "Lubao Village, in the wheat planting, the cooperative leadership collectively soaked the seeds, saving labor and disinfecting, but Lu Gengchen's group valued each work day at seven catties of rice, while other groups valued it at five catties, which somewhat affected the combination of the three aspects and large-scale labor exchange." Zhangjiashan pointed out to Chengjiashan: They did a better job in combining cotton repair with agricultural and sideline production, but in the rush to plant wheat, they only focused on speed, hindering deep plowing and meticulous work. For example, Zhang Zhouyuan did not repair the field ridges when planting wheat, and did not plow the second furrow. Also, many households had fertilizer but did not bother to move it to the fields. After two days of in-depth participation in mutual assistance and meticulous and patient learning by 84 people, the mutual aid groups in various villages improved a step further, promoting the autumn harvesting work.

　　北流基点互相参观提高互助推动收耕
    【本报黎城讯】二区北流基点，于十月二号开全基点扩干英雄会，各村的英雄提出组织参观队互相变工，交流经验，提高互助。如路堡到北流村出席八人均是英雄、生产积极分子，参加他村互助组分别一人一组，在做活中来访问，八人中选正副组长各一人，夜间一块交流，参观内容主要是变工等价深耕细作、农业技术、农副战勤三大结合、领导开展运动的经验与对三属照顾等。参观后，尽量通过群众，总结学习经验，并提出对他村今后工作改进意见。路堡村英雄路江河说：“人家北流工作劲头就是大，好似底火吹一样，每个运动都是从下到上群众自定精确计划，不是干部包办。比如英雄李文犊组，真是做到按活计工，合理使用劳畜力，及时奖励好劳力，按季节又能总结表扬，咱回去一定要学习这一点做法”。总结北流全村二十一个互助组，特别英雄李文犊、赵记良等八个模范互助组，能常年互助，农副战勤结合上也好，等价变工按活计工，做到了深耕细作，每逢播种锄苗上肥，总是三属样样在先。刘兰田等九个一般组，在农业互助很好，就是三结合上较差。还有段树声等四个形式互助组，开会在一块，如忙不过来变上几天工，一般的是各顾各，段夫德组从春天即互助现在才参加过一天半互助组做活，刘土成组给南下干部李丕业代耕荒了地。北流农会主席张连魁说：“路堡村在种麦中合作社领导集体浸种省工又消毒，但有路庚辰组等价每工七斤米，其他组五斤，有些影响三结合与大变工”。张家山对程家山提出：在修理棉花上与农副结合做的较好，但在突击种麦只图快，防碍了深耕细作，如张周员种麦连边堰都未修，二犁也未耕，还有不少户有肥没顾搬到地。经过两天八十四人深入参加互助细致耐心学习，使各村的互助组都提高一步，促进了收耕工作。
