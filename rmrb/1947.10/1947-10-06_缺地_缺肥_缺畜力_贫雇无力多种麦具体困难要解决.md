[Report from the *Shahe* Correspondent] In Nanwang Village, the Sixth District, Comrade Gao, the Land Reform Cadre, discovered while mobilizing the masses to expand wheat planting areas that newly emancipated households were unable to plant more wheat. For example, the Geng family had 29.5 *mu* of land but only planted 12 *mu* of wheat. They wanted to plant more but lacked the labor force. Cui Shuanwang's family of three had only three *mu* of land and could plant at most two *mu*. Liu Pang, one person, had only one *mu* of land. Wen Chou Niang, one person, had only 1.5 *mu* of land, with half a *mu* planted with buckwheat (which grew poorly). She pulled up the buckwheat and wanted to plant all of it with wheat. These households all wanted to plant more wheat, but they had no land (because they were considered "backward" during land reform and received little land). After discovering this problem, a thorough household-by-household inspection was organized throughout the village. More than 20 newly emancipated households have now been identified who want to plant more but are unable to do so due to a lack of land, labor, draught animals, or wheat seeds. Comrade Gao immediately convened a meeting of village cadres in the district, explained the seriousness of the problem, and proposed that each village conduct a census, land survey, and wheat planting survey during wheat planting, focusing on families of soldiers and those without labor, to help them solve their difficulties and plant more wheat.

[Report from the *Gaoyi* Correspondent] In Sunjia Village, during the calculation of annual harvests, the masses recognized that the most fundamental way to shorten the period of natural disasters is to plant more wheat. During the discussion on wheat planting, many difficulties faced by emancipated peasants were discovered. The first is the lack of fertilizer, so everyone discussed launching a crash program to accumulate fertilizer. The masses proposed the slogan: "Earth that has been away from the ground for three years is *yang* earth (such as wall earth, *kang* earth, collapsed house earth), earth for earth will yield five *shi* per *mu*." Everyone composted collapsed house earth and *kang* earth. To accumulate more fertilizer, a wave of sweeping streets and courtyards was launched. The slogan was, "Raising pigs not in pens doesn't pay off," and "Don't leave the barn without chaff, don't leave the house without a basket," so now some people even carry manure baskets to meetings. According to statistics, one *mu* of wheat land in the village can now receive two large cartloads of fertilizer. After solving the fertilizer problem, it was discovered that emancipated peasants wanted to plant wheat but had no livestock or wheat seeds. The village purchased twelve new livestock to help the masses plant wheat. The village cooperative prepared 28 *shi* and 7 *dou* of wheat seeds and distributed them to 195 households using several methods: relief, exchange, and loans, depending on the amount of wheat planted by each household. The enthusiasm of the masses for planting wheat is even higher. Households and groups have challenged each other to plant wheat. After calculation, Zhang Da Hong's group will ensure that 80% of their land is planted with wheat. Each mutual aid group has made a plan. The whole village has 1,400 *mu* of land and 72 draught animals. Now that there is fertilizer and seeds, there is a guarantee that 900 *mu* will be planted with wheat. In order to complete the wheat planting plan 100%, it was decided to sow in three periods. All wheat fields will be sown by the end of the eighth month of the lunar calendar. Now the fertilizer and seeds have all been prepared, and the land where crops have been harvested has also been plowed. Now the masses are proceeding according to their own plans.

[Report from the *Xiyang* Correspondent] The masses in Ziping discussed wheat planting, and in the discussion, they raised three major difficulties: wheat seeds, fertilizer, and draught animals. Then everyone came up with solutions: (1) Regarding wheat seeds: First, everyone reported how much wheat seed they were short. After calculation, the total shortage was 2 *shi*, 7 *dou*, and 5 *sheng*. Then Hao Furu proposed: "Farmers all over the world are one family, we should adjust with each other. I will take out 8 *dou* of wheat to solve the wheat seed difficulty in our village," which influenced Kang Duobiao and others to voluntarily adjust 1 *shi* and 8 *dou* and 5 *sheng*. The rest was solved by the government providing a loan of 30,000 yuan. (2) Regarding fertilizer: The masses discussed that they should make another effort to scrape the base of the field and dig the edges to improve the wheat land, which can also replace fertilizer. 4,637 *zhang* have been scraped and over 4,000 *zhang* of edges have been dug. It was also proposed that each *mu* should be guaranteed to have 15 loads of household manure. (3) Regarding draught animals: Everyone discussed that draught animals should be adjusted throughout the village. The shady slopes should be planted first, and then the sunny slopes (delaying the shady slopes will reduce the harvest), so that they can be transferred. Now all the land in the village has been plowed, and a crash sowing is underway, with each person guaranteed to plant 2 *mu*. (Xin Ying)

　　缺地·缺肥·缺畜力
  　贫雇无力多种麦具体困难要解决
    【本报沙河讯】六区高分书在南汪村发动群众扩大麦田中，发现新翻身户无人多种麦子，如耿＠家二十九亩半地，只种十二亩麦子。再想多种但是缺乏劳力，不能多种。崔拴枉三口人，只有三亩地，最多能种二亩。刘胖的一口人，也只有一亩地，文丑娘一口人，只一亩半地，还有半亩种了荞麦（长的很赖），她把荞麦拔掉要全数种上麦子。这些户都要求多种麦子，但是没地就没办法（翻身中被认为“落后”，分得的地少）。发现此问题后，即组织全村挨门挨户大检查，现已查出二十多个新翻身户，因地少或缺乏劳畜力、麦种等，想多种而不能多种。高分书当即召开全区村干部会，说明这个问题的严重性，并提出各村在种麦中都要进行查人口、查土地、查种麦数，并着重查抗属和无劳力户，帮助他们解决困难多种麦子。（奎林）
    【本报高邑讯】孙家庄在算年成算家当中，群众认识缩短灾荒最基本的办法是多种麦子。在讨论种麦中又发现翻身农民有好多困难，首先是没肥料，所以大家商量要突击积肥，群众提出口号是：“离地三年为阳土（如墙土、炕土、落房土）土换土一亩地打石五”。大家将落房土、炕土都沤了粪。为了多积肥，又开展了扫街院的热潮，把猪都圈到圈里，口号是“养猪不在圈，结果不上算”，又提出“吃饭不离糠，走路不离筐”，所以现在有些人开会也背着粪筐。现在统计该村一亩麦地可以上到二大车肥料。肥料解决后，发现翻身群众想种麦子没牲口，也没麦种，村里又新买了十二个牲口，帮助群众种麦，村合作社已准备了二十八石七斗麦种，按各户种麦多少分别以救济的、换给的、借给的几种办法，分发了一百九十五户。群众种麦情绪更高，户与户组与组提出了种麦挑战，张大红组经计算后要保证百分之八十的地种上麦子。各互助组都订了计划，全村共有地一千四百亩，七十二个畜力，现在已经有了粪、有了种子、保证种上麦子的，即有九百亩，为了百分之百的完成种麦计划，决定分三个时期下种，旧历八月底要将所有的麦田下完种。现在肥料种子已全部准备好，收了庄稼的地也都耕了，现在群众都在按照自己的计划进行着。（维民、金魁、文彦）
    【本报昔阳讯】紫坪群众讨论种麦，在讨论中提出了麦种、肥料、畜力三大困难，接着大家来想办法：（一）在麦种方面：首先让大家逐户报了谁短多少麦种，计算后共短二石七斗五升，当有郝福如提出：天下农民是一家，咱们应互相调剂，我要拿出八斗麦解决咱村麦种困难，影响了康夺彪等自动调剂一石八斗五升，其余政府给贷了三万元款，解决了麦种困难。（二）在肥料方面：群众讨论要再努一把力刮桩刨边，修好麦地，也能顶粪，现已刮桩四千六百三十七丈，刨边四千余丈，并提出每亩保证还上家粪十五担。（三）在畜力方面：大家讨论畜力要进行全村大调剂，先种背坡地，后种阳坡地（背坡地迟了要减低收成），这样就能抽调开。现全村土地已经翻了，正在突击播种，每人保证种二亩。
