　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 6th. The military and civilians of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces are cooperating with the Chen-Su Army in throwing themselves into the wave of a major counter-offensive. On the Chen-Su Army's southern advance, farmers along the way repaired bridges and roads, enabling the army to advance rapidly. When a unit of the People's Liberation Army, chasing the enemy, reached the Wo River and Sha River, local farmers had already built pontoon bridges within a few hours after the fleeing of the Chiang troops, allowing the PLA to cross smoothly. Whenever the troops entered an encampment, the masses came out of the villages to welcome them, automatically prepared beds, boiled water, and competed to slaughter pigs and sheep to comfort and entertain them, treating them like family. After the recovery of Xiayi, thousands of farmers immediately went out to clear the Chiang army's fortifications on the city walls. The 2.5 million soldiers and civilians of the Third Military Sub-district wrote in a letter of appreciation to the Chen-Su counter-offensive army: "We are willing to use all our strength to support the counter-offensive army, help our loved ones, and work together to eliminate the traitorous and calamitous Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang!"

　　陈粟大军南下途中群众修桥补路迎接
    【新华社华东前线六日电】豫皖苏军民配合陈粟大军投入大反攻浪潮。大军南下途中，沿路农民修桥补路，使大军迅速前进。追击敌人之解放军某部进抵涡河、沙河时，当地农民已于蒋军逃遁后数小时内将浮桥架好，使解放军顺利渡过。每当部队进入宿营地，群众即出庄欢迎，并自动准备好床铺、烧好开水，争相杀猪宰羊，慰劳款待，亲如家人。夏邑收复后。数千农民立即出动扫除城垣之蒋军工事。第三军分区二百五十万军民在致陈粟反攻大军的慰问信中写道：“我们愿用一切力量支援反攻大军，帮助我们的亲人，共同努力消灭卖国殃民的蒋家匪帮！”
