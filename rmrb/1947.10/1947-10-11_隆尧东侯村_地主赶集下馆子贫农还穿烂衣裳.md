　　Longyao East Hou Village
  　Landlords Go to Market and Eat in Restaurants, Poor Peasants Still Wear Rags
    [Report from this newspaper] At the Peasant Association's review conference in East Hou Village, Longyao District One, two points were identified: First, although there had been a major upheaval last year, the poor peasants had not truly turned over. For example, poor peasants Hu Yiwan and Wang Ertao still wore tattered clothes, relying on weaving sieves and patching walls for income, owning little land, no furniture, and no livestock. Wang Ertao said, "It's all talk about 'turning over,' all we got was a few acres of land, but many families don't have livestock, and the landlords haven't been thoroughly dealt with. For example, landlord Hu Laoqian still eats well, always eating in restaurants when he goes to market or meetings, always saying 'Eat something, drink something, it's a waste to not eat and drink in these times.' He's smug and putting on airs, and still ignores the poor." After review, everyone raised their class consciousness and unanimously recognized that village cadres and the masses had not been ruthless enough last year, so the landlords weren't thoroughly dealt with. Therefore, it was decided: to eliminate all pity, to dig out all landlord air-raid shelters, and to thoroughly eliminate the landlords and ensure a complete turning over.
    Another report: At the village cadre and hired peasant meeting in Ninging District Three, it was reviewed that the landlords had not been thoroughly turned over in the past. Discussions were conducted at the village level, and it was found that there were still 422 landlord and rich peasant households in the district who had not been thoroughly dealt with. For example, Zhao Qingkai, a local tyrant landlord from Cui Guan Village, still strutted around showing off his foreign airs. When the reasons were examined, it was said that some village cadres had been bought off and used by the landlords, and that the masses had feelings of pity. After finding the root of the problem, everyone said painfully, "We must deal with them thoroughly in the future."

　　隆尧东侯村
  　地主赶集下馆子贫农还穿烂衣裳
    【本报讯】隆尧一区东侯村农会员翻身检查大会上，检查出两点：一、去年虽经大动，但贫农都未翻身。如贫农胡一万王二桃还是穿破烂衣裳，靠编笊篱墙口，种地少家具没牲口。王二桃说：“光说翻身翻身，光有了几亩地，很多家里没牲口，地主没斗彻底。如地主胡老千还是净吃好的，赶集上会就是下馆子，常说吃点吧喝点吧，这年头不吃不喝也是白。洋洋得意摆着臭架子，见了穷人还是不理。经检查大家提高了阶级觉悟，一致认识了去年村干和群众都没下狠心，所以没斗透。遂决定：肃清怜悯心，挖净地主防空洞，彻底消灭地主翻透身。
    又讯：宁南三区在村干、雇贫大会上检查过去未翻透身，以村为单位进行讨论，查出全区尚有四百二十二户地主、富农未斗透，如崔官庄恶霸地主赵庆凯还是大摇大摆抖洋劲。当检查原因时，都说有些村干被地主收买利用，以及群众的怜悯思想。找出病根后，大家都很痛心的说：“以后非斗彻底不行。“
