Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: TASS, Moscow: The Pravda published an editorial on the 10th, pointing out that the communiqué of the Nine-Nation Communist Party Representatives Conference, which was announced on the 6th, has the most important political significance. The editorial stated: The representatives of the Communist Parties of some Central and Southeastern European countries attended this conference. These Communist Parties have rich experience in leading the working class and all democratic forces in the victorious struggle against fascism and reactionary forces. Moreover, they are the vanguards of those countries that have broken free from the clutches of foreign imperialism and laid a strong foundation for the development of new democracy. Representatives of the French and Italian Communist Parties also attended the conference. France and Italy are currently subject to particularly strong pressure from American imperialism. These two parties enjoy high prestige among the masses. Representatives of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) also attended the conference. For thirty years, the All-Union Communist Party has led the world's first great socialist country. Analyzing the main points of the conference's declaration on the international situation, Pravda pointed out: As a result of World War II, the forces of democracy and socialism have greatly developed. As a result of the First World War, the imperialist chain suffered its first major break, and the powerful socialist Soviet Union emerged on one-sixth of the earth's land. As a result of the Second World War, the capitalist world suffered another serious blow. Not only have two thoroughly armed militarist imperialist countries, which were planned by international reactionaries to attack the Soviet Union, collapsed, but also new democratic countries were born from the flames of anti-fascist struggle, shaking off imperialist enslavement and laying the foundation for their socialist development. Pravda then refuted the clamor of the press in the imperialist camp that the "Communist International has been revived," stating: The documents we have published clearly indicate that the established Information Bureau of the Nine-Nation Party (formerly translated as "Liaison Bureau," should be corrected) does not specify the re-establishment of a worldwide communist organization—with centralized leadership, like the former Communist International. As everyone knows, the Communist International was dissolved as early as 1943. Since the dissolution of the Communist International, the parties of various countries have greatly developed, their strength has increased, and their influence among the masses has also grown. Therefore, the dissolution of the International was completely correct and played a positive role in the development of the workers' movement. The Communist International, which played a positive role in cultivating leaders of the working class, has long become a historical relic in the development of the international workers' movement. To restore it now would be a regression rather than a progress. Warmongers like Churchill, who are deathly afraid of the restoration of the Communist International, cannot understand this. But it is easy to understand for those who are eager to consolidate peace and cooperation between countries, consolidate the independence and democracy of countries, and consolidate socialism and democracy.
    Pravda pointed out: The Nine-Nation Communist Party Representatives Conference was held under new circumstances—when the imperialist reactionaries are launching an offensive against the sovereignty, freedom, and independence of all countries. It once again proves to the world that Communists have always been and still are the most reliable and loyal fighters for freedom, for national sovereignty, for democracy, and for peace. Pravda ridiculed the squeals of those bourgeois newspapers (such as the New York Times of the United States, the Manchester Guardian of the United Kingdom, the Daily Mail, and the French Figaro, etc.) about the so-called "danger" and "conspiracy" of the Communist Party, saying: Gentlemen, what's the matter? Why are you making such a fuss? Recently, socialists and labor party members from a dozen or so countries held two meetings together and re-established their International as the international leadership center of these parties. So why can't the Communist Parties hold their party meetings and at least organize an information bureau to exchange experiences? Gentlemen, if you are friends of peace, you must welcome the peaceful desire of the Communists to decide to organize resistance to the instigators of war and prevent them from provoking a new war. Gentlemen, haven't you realized that when you are alarmed by the decisions of the Nine-Nation Communist Party Representatives Conference, you inadvertently expose yourselves as the initiators of war and enemies of peace? You are indignant that the Communist Party's conference decided to organize resistance to the American plan to enslave Europe. Do you intend to support the enslavement of European countries? Are you against the sovereignty and independence of European countries?

### 九国共产党成立情报局　是保卫各国独立民主  防止国际反动派威胁欧洲和平

　　九国共产党成立情报局
  　是保卫各国独立民主
    防止国际反动派威胁欧洲和平
    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报十日发表社论，指出六日所公布的九国共产党代表会议公报具有最重大的政治意义称：出席此次会议的有中欧与东南欧一些国家的共产党代表，这些共产党具有领导工人阶级及一切民主力量以反对法西斯主义及反动势力的胜利斗争之丰富经验，而且它们是那些挣脱了外国帝国主义统治的魔爪，并奠立了新民主发展的强固基础之国家的先锋队。出席会议的还有法、意两国共产党代表，法、意两国是美帝国主义目前正施以特别强大压力的对象，这两党在群众中则享有高度的威信。出席会议的并有联共（布）代表，三十年来，联共领导着世界上第一个伟大的社会主义国家。在分析会议对国际形势宣言之要点时，真理报指出：由于第二次世界大战的结果，民主与社会主义的力量已经有了极其巨大的发展。第一次大战结果，帝国主义环节遭受了第一次重大的破坏，地球的六分之一土地上出现了强大的社会主义苏联。第二次大战结果，又使资本主义世界受到另一次严重打击，不仅两个彻底武装的为国际反动派计划用来进攻苏联的黩武帝国主义国家已经垮台，而且新民主主义国家从反法西斯斗争火焰中诞生，摆脱了帝国主义奴役，并奠立了它们社会主义发展的基础。真理报继批驳帝国主义阵营中报界所谓“共产国际复活了”的叫嚣称：我们所发表的文件，明白地表示设立的九国党的情报局（前曾译为“联络局”，应改正）却并未指明要重新设立一个世界范围的共产机构——有集中的领导权，象过去共产国际一样。众所周知，共产国际早于一九四三年解散了。自共产国际解散以来，各国党已有大大的发展，力量增强了，在群众中的影响也增长了，因此国际的解散是完全正确的，并在工人阶级运动的发展中起了积极的作用。在培养工人阶级领袖方面起过积极作用的共产国际，早就成为国际工人阶级运动发展历史上的陈迹了，现在恢复它，将会是退步而不是进步。像邱吉尔之流对共产国际恢复怕得要死的战争贩子们，是不可能了解这点的。但是对那些亟欲巩固各国间的和平与合作、巩固各国的独立与民主、巩固社会主义与民主的人来说，这是很容易了解的。
    真理报指出：九国共产党代表会议是在新的情况下——在帝国主义反动派正对各国主权、自由与独立发动攻势的情况下召开的。它再次向全世界证明：共产党人曾经是而且仍然是争取自由、争取国家主权、争取民主与和平的最可靠与最忠实的战士。真理报嘲笑那些资产阶级报纸（如美国纽约时报，英国曼彻斯特卫报，每日邮报及法国费嘉罗报等）尖叫所谓共产党的“危险”“阴谋”之类的嘁嘁喳喳称：先生，是什么事情？为何这么大惊小怪？最近十几个国家的社会党人与工党党员一起举行了两次会议，并且还重新设立了他们的国际，以作为这些政党的国际领导中心。那么为什么共产党不能召开它们党的会议而且至少要组织情报局借以交换经验呢？先生们，假如你们是和平之友，你们就必须欢迎共产党人决定组织对战争挑拨者的抵抗及防止他们挑起新战争的这种和平愿望。先生们，你们还未发觉当你们对九国共产党代表会议的决定大惊小怪时，就无意中暴露了你们自己是战争的发起人与和平的敌人吗？你们对共产党会议决定必须对美国奴役欧洲的计划组织抵抗一事表示愤慨，难道你们打算拥护奴役欧洲各国吗？你们反对欧洲各国的主权与独立吗？
