Taihang Farmers Overcome Disaster, Autumn Harvest Expected to Average 50%
[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 7th] The emancipated farmers of Taihang have overcome a severe disaster, and the average autumn harvest in the entire region is expected to reach 50% (the highest is 70%, the lowest is 15%, mostly in border areas affected by natural and man-made disasters), and harvesting is now actively underway. From the beginning of spring until late July this year, the entire region suffered from a widespread drought, which caused great difficulties for planting. In May, June, and July, many areas were also hit by severe hailstorms and some areas by insect plagues, damaging the small seedlings that had been painstakingly planted, making the disaster even more serious. The drought affected more than two million people, and the hailstorms affected 631 villages in 19 counties, damaging more than 377,800 mu of crops, reducing grain production by more than 241,960 shi. In the face of the severe disaster, the farmers were not intimidated, but actively organized themselves to wage a tenacious battle against the disaster. This was first manifested in the first, second, and third rounds of replanting; because of the prolonged drought, even when it rained, it was mostly in patches, only two or three fingers wide, and with the addition of hailstorms, the seedlings were generally only caught after three (or even four or five) plantings. To this end, the farmers created many methods, mainly carrying water to plant and taking advantage of the damp soil to plant, watering (filling with water) to plant, dry planting, borrowing damp soil to plant (taking wet soil from other places), and finding damp soil to plant (removing dry soil to expose wet soil) were also very common. In Neiqiu County alone, more than 25,500 mu were planted by carrying water, 61,684 mu were planted by watering, and 300,600 mu were planted by seizing the opportunity. These methods account for 84% of the total autumn land. Secondly, they tried every means to protect the small seedlings. When the seedlings emerged and were subjected to various disasters, the masses organized a campaign to protect the seedlings. The methods included: (1) Watering, such as in the villages near the river in Zuoquan, where they watered one bucket and one scoop at a time, and each person could water half a mu per day; (2) Cultivating and hoeing more often, most places hoed three times, implementing the slogan "Hoeing in dry weather, the hoe has water"; (3) Covering the seedlings with tree branches or grass, in Shexian County, more than 900 people in Chengguan covered 1,500 mu in one day; (4) After the hailstorms, they tried to prop up the small seedlings as much as possible, such as Yuan Shulin, the village head of Yuanzhuang Village in Zuoquan, who led the masses to prop up 256 mu of seedlings in two days. For insect pests, all localities carried out locust control and insect extermination. Again, to meet the requirements of spot planting and watering seedlings, small-scale water conservancy construction has also been greatly developed. According to statistics from more than 900 villages in 22 counties, more than 500 large and small canals were repaired, 1,071 wells were dug and dredged, and 1,029 ponds were dug and dredged, increasing the area of irrigated land by 280,000 mu, which can increase grain production by 120,000 shi, enough for 240,000 people to survive the famine year. In the construction of water conservancy, the masses not only gave full play to their creativity (such as using mountain gully water, underground water, coal mine water, etc.), but also clarified the long-term nature of water conservancy construction in their thinking. The basic reason for overcoming the disaster is that the farmers have a high degree of awareness after the land reform, have a leadership backbone of poor and hired peasants, have a foundation of being organized for several years, and have the experience of fighting the disaster in 1942 and 1943, thus ensuring that the struggle is carried out from beginning to end.

　　太行农民战胜灾荒秋禾平均可收五成
    【本报太行七日电】太行翻身农民战胜了严重的灾荒，全区秋禾平均达到五成收（最高的七成，最低的一成半，多系天灾人祸的边地），现正积极进行收割。今年从开春直到七月下旬，全区普遍亢旱，下种遭到了极大困难。五、六、七月，许多地区又加上了严重的雹灾与部分地方的虫灾，一些地区勉强捉住的小苗，又被损害，致灾情更形严重。旱灾受灾人口在二百万以上，雹灾危及十九县六百三十一村，遭害庄稼三十七万七千八百余亩，减收粮二十四万一千九百六十余石。在严重的灾荒面前，农民并未被吓倒，而是积极地组织起来，与灾荒进行了顽强的决斗。首先表现在一次、二次、三次的抢种补种；因久旱不雨，即使落雨，亦多是一片一片的，三指二指的，加之冰雹袭击，所以一般是三次（甚至有四次五次的）下种才捉住了苗。为此农民创造了许多办法，主要是担水抢种与趁垧抢种，润（灌满水）种，寄种（干种），借垧下种（从别处取湿土），找垧下种（除去干土露出湿土）等办法也很普遍。仅内邱一县，即担水点种二万五千五百余亩，润种六万一千六百八十四亩，抢种三十万六千亩。共占全部秋地百分之八十四。其次是想尽办法保护了小苗。当小苗出土遭到种种灾害时，群众又组织了保苗斗争。做法上有：（一）用水浇，如左权沿河近水各村，曾一桶一杓的浇水，每人每日能浇半亩；（二）加工多锄，大部地方锄过三遍，实行了“天旱锄苗，锄头有水”的口号；（三）用树枝或草盖苗，涉县城关九百余人一天即盖了一千五百亩；（四）冰雹打过的小苗，尽可能的扶苗，如左权原庄村长原树林领导群众，两天即扶苗二百五十六亩。对于虫害，各地都进行了打蝗、灭虫。再次适应点种与浇苗的要求，小型的水利建设也有极大的发展。据二十二县九百余村统计，修复大小渠五百余条，打井掏井一千零七十一眼，打池掏池一千零二十九个，新增水地二十八万亩，可增产粮十二万石，足够二十四万人渡荒年。兴修水利中，群众不仅高度的发挥了创造性（如利用山沟涧水、地下层水、煤井水等），而且在思想上亦明确了水利建设的长期性。战胜灾荒的基本原因，是土改后农民有了高度的觉悟，有了贫雇的领导骨干，有好几年组织起来的基础，有四二、四三年与灾荒斗争的经验，因此，使斗争贯彻始终。
