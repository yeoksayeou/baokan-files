Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. Reports from various sources: The economic report of the sixteen European countries, which was twice difficult to produce, was signed in Paris on the 22nd. Abstracts of the report were also released on the same day in Washington and the capitals of the sixteen countries. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Italian Foreign Minister Sforza and others delivered brief speeches before the signing, striking a low note, on the one hand, "emphasizing the seriousness of the financial and economic situation in Europe," and on the other hand, expressing not very optimistic views on American aid. The report stated: "Before American aid arrives, maximum efforts should be made to seek self-recovery." (Agence France-Presse, 23rd) According to the summary of the report released by the US Information Service, the most important points, apart from listing a bunch of utopian production targets, are two: First, it exposes the extreme severity of the economic situation in Western European countries. The report, after listing Western Europe's "shrinking industrial production, shortage of food, coal, and materials, rising prices, and depletion of foreign exchange," openly admitted that "by the summer of 1947, the hope of rapid recovery had disappeared, and the depth of the crisis was far more serious than expected." Second, the report also reveals the irreconcilable economic contradictions between the United States and Western European countries. The report emphasized that the primary task of recovery is to "increase production" and "intensify the expansion of exports," "but unless the markets of the American continent allow the large-scale dumping of goods from Europe and other parts of the world, it will be of no avail." To ask the United States, which is trying to monopolize the American market and expand into the European and Asian markets, to do this is like asking a tiger for its skin.

　　欧十六国经济报告显示
  　西欧经济形势严重
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】各方报导：两度难产之欧洲十六国经济报告，已于二十二日在巴黎签字，报告之摘要亦于同日在华盛顿及十六国京城公布。英外相贝文与意外相史佛卓等在签字前发表简短演说，弹唱低调，一面“强调欧洲财政与经济形势之严重”，一面则对美国援助表示不甚乐观。报告称：“在美国援助到来以前，应作最大努力，以谋自行恢复。”（法新闻社廿三日电）另据美新闻处公布之该报告摘要，其中除在列举一大堆乌托邦式的生产目标之数字外，最重要者有二：第一，它暴露出西欧各国经济形势之极端严重。该报告列举西欧“工业生产缩小，粮食煤斤与物资缺乏、物价多涨、外汇枯竭”之后，公开承认“至四七年夏季，迅速复兴之希望，业已消逝，危机之深重远远预料者为甚。”第二、该报告复透露美国与西欧各国经济矛盾之不可调和。该报告强调复兴之首要工作是“必须增加生产”，“加紧扩充输出，”“但除非美洲大陆之市场允许欧洲及世界其他部分之货物大量倾销，否则无补于事。”以此要求力图独占美洲市场并向欧亚市场扩张的美国，无异与虎谋皮。
