　　【Benbao Taiyue, 3rd dispatch】 Jincheng military families of martyrs and honored retired soldiers, in order to perform meritorious service in the great counter-offensive, have voluntarily declined assistance with farming. Since Jincheng launched the enthusiastic campaign of rushing to plant "counter-offensive wheat" and rushing to harvest "victory grain," men, women, and children have been mobilized, busy in the fields and threshing grounds. All military families of martyrs and honored retired soldiers are also competing to perform meritorious service, declining assistance with farming from the masses. In the Third District, there are 717 military families and 49 honored retired soldiers who declined assistance. In the Second District, there are 53 families of martyrs, including Zhao Yaocheng, 106 honored retired soldiers, including Guo Shijun, and 206 military families, including Li Sangu, who declined assistance. In the Seventh District, there are 220 military families who declined assistance. Some military families of martyrs even voluntarily offered to help others. Honored retired soldiers requested to participate in the war effort like the masses, undertaking the glorious task of supporting the great counter-offensive. Military families of martyrs and honored retired soldiers in other areas have similarly declined assistance with farming in the same spirit. The masses, with enthusiasm and excitement, besides accepting this request and reporting their merits and setting an example for them, have dissuaded military families of martyrs and honored retired soldiers who need assistance with farming with tactful words and continued to provide help. Due to the development of this movement, a large number of laborers can be saved to support the front lines.

　　晋城军烈属荣誉军人
  　自耕自种支援反攻
    【本报太岳三日电】晋城军烈属荣退军人为在大反攻中立功，纷纷自动谢绝代耕。晋城自展开抢种“反攻麦”抢收“胜利粮”的热潮运动后，男女老少个个动手，场里地里忙成一团，所有军烈属及荣退军人，亦争相立功，向群众谢绝代耕，三区有七百一十七户军属，四十九位荣退军人，二区有烈属赵尧成等五十三家，荣退军人郭士俊等一百零六位，军属李三古等二百零六家，七区有二百二十户军属，均谢绝代耕。甚至有些军烈属自动提出要帮助别人。荣退军人要求和群众一样参战担负起支援大反攻的光荣任务。其他各地军烈属与荣退军人，都以同样精神谢绝代耕，群众在热情激动下，除接受这一要求为他们报功表模外，对必需代耕之军烈属及荣退军人加以婉词劝阻，继续予以帮助。由于这一运动的开展，可省出大批劳力支援前线。
