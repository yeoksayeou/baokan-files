　　Old Qin Yi, the Master of Quick Clapper Propaganda
    Hou Zhennan

    Qin Yi is from Nan Jingse Village, Eighth District, Lin County. He is forty-nine years old this year. His family was very poor since he was a child. At the age of twelve, he herded sheep for others until he was twenty-eight. He recalled that when he was herding sheep, no one looked up to him. He stayed on the mountains all day long, and no one would help him in wind or rain. It was always like this all year round. He got drenched in the rain in summer and suffered from the cold in winter. The sheep inevitably ate some field seedlings on the hillside, but even if they didn't, people would scold him for no reason from afar. He was beaten and scolded by the sheep owner at home and suffered other people's sarcasm in the fields. It was very difficult, not to mention that no one wanted to marry him. The women said when they saw Qin Yi, "Whoever marries a shepherd will be widowed for three years and two and a half years, and will have to guard the sheepfold in the coldest winter months." He said to the women, "Whoever marries a shepherd will get to eat mutton and fried rice." But no one paid attention to him. Later, as time went on, Qin Yi felt hopeless. So he went home at the age of twenty-nine and started selling willow wares. He sold them for four or five years. Although he couldn't make a living, he felt better than before, at least he wasn't beaten and scolded by others. He had a place to live in when it rained or the wind blew. Later, he became a wool broker in a workshop, bought a spinning wheel himself and went home, spinning some thread. In 1943, the Eighth Route Army came, and he joined the farmers' association, settled accounts with the landlords, struggled against them, and led the masses to turn themselves over. Now there are four people in his family, who have been allocated seven mu of land, more than ten shi of grain, two thousand five hundred yuan, and various furniture. He is active in various tasks in the village and has won the support of the broad masses. He leads production and is very happy. Below is his propaganda and mobilization work in various tasks:

    I. During Weeding of Wheat
    When weeding wheat, he organized mutual aid teams. At that time, some village cadres said, "We have struggled against the landlords for several years, and the land is also small. We have no energy to produce. The superiors just ask us to produce, and there is already a production director, so why should we manage?" Qin Yi said: Our cadres' task is first to lead everyone to turn themselves over, and second to lead production. After his mobilization and persuasion, the village cadres' enthusiasm also increased. They also discussed how to do mutual aid well. He compiled a quick clapper for everyone:

    Village cadres, want to develop,
    Promote village's great production.
    How to run mutual aid teams,
    Listen to me talk about it once.
    First, be democratic,
    Second, be voluntary.
    Third, be equivalent,
    Fourth, exchange.
    Fifth, be active,
    Sixth, select models.

    After this propaganda, he organized fifty-two mutual aid teams in his administrative village within a few days. He also went to various teams and places to inspect and broadcast the good ones everywhere. If there were problems, everyone discussed solutions. For the good teams, he also compiled a quick clapper to commend them. It was:

    ×× team is doing well,
    Work point method is done.
    Evaluate work according to strength,
    Open a ticket every day.
    The good ones should be broadcast,
    Everyone knows.
    Mutual aid can save labor,
    Everyone gets benefits.
    Do it well, do it beautifully, (meaning pretty)
    The county government can report it in the newspaper.
    Models get rewards,
    Everyone knows the glory.

    After such mobilization, everyone's enthusiasm for mutual aid became greater and greater. Some said that they would get up early and work late to compete for a model, but some individual teams also collapsed. The main reason was that they did not settle accounts for a long time. In order to reorganize these teams, he compiled another quick clapper:

    Some teams have collapsed,
    No one comes to participate in mutual aid.
    What to do if no one comes,
    The team leader calls a meeting to settle accounts.
    You calculate, I calculate,
    No penny is owed.
    Settle the accounts, no debts,
    Our mutual aid will be improved.

    After this, those who had collapsed quickly cleared their accounts, reorganized, and all recovered. Some individuals were selfish, which affected the consolidation of the mutual aid team. He also compiled a quick clapper:

    Some people can't say,
    Participate in mutual aid without awareness.
    He complains that it is too little to weed for him,
    He says there is too much in other people's fields.
    This kind of person talks nicely,
    Sooner or later, their mouth and heart will not match.
    You flatter me, I flatter you,
    Never want them in the mutual aid team.

    After his quick clapper propaganda, those selfish people all became aware. Within three or four days, two to three thousand mu of wheat fields in the whole village were weeded.

    II. Promoting Everyone to Plant Cotton
    When it was time to plant cotton, it was dry and there was no rain. The government asked each village to plant a large amount of cotton. Qin Yi told everyone everywhere that it was not enough to only plant grain without planting cotton. He called for early planting to harvest more, convened a meeting to mobilize, and called on women and children to carry water to plant. Before dawn, he went to the temple to ring the bell to rouse the whole village. Some carried, some carried on poles. In order to boost the morale of women and children, he said in a quick clapper:

    Carry water, run fast,
    Production catches up with ×××,
    You run, I run,
    Guarantee to exchange for new clothes in autumn.
    You don't run, I don't move,
    Guarantee to freeze in the autumn.

    He went to various places to inspect and promote, which increased everyone's enthusiasm. Children were also singing everywhere. He said to the women:

    Women's team, want to get rich,
    Organize to plant cotton.
    Soak the seeds to sprout,
    Carry the hoe and plant them.
    Want to plant cotton well,
    First, strive to sow early.
    The depth of planting is the most difficult,
    The elderly group comes with mutual aid.
    The elderly group says it once,
    The deepest is no more than two and a half fingers.

    Under his propaganda and encouragement, everyone also knew how to plant, and the whole village was involved in planting, planting a total of one hundred and thirty-four mu of cotton fields.

    III. Promoting the Combination of Production and Participation in the War
    The laborers in the village all went to Tangyin to participate in the war, and the village was left with women, children, and the elderly. The elderly also sent rice and flour to the front line every day. He helped the families of soldiers carry water and plant vegetables at home, and called on them to ensure that the families of the participants in the war planted vegetables. His propaganda slogan was:

    The production director can run on the streets,
    Production and support for the military must be done well.
    Plow the land and plant flowers,
    Plant sweet potatoes and pumpkins.
    Spring seedlings are neatly arranged,
    Catch up with the little donkey to send manure.
    How much manure is sent,
    Catch up with the little donkey to the front.
    Send rice and flour to the front,
    The army eats and works harder,
    The front has great victories,
    Production in the rear is not difficult.

    IV. Saving for Disaster Preparedness
    A drought was forming. The government called on villages to organize production, prevent drought, and prepare for famine, and called on everyone to save. But the people ate and drank heavily, saying: The Eighth Route Army won't let people starve to death, it doesn't matter. Qin Yi called on people everywhere, using various meetings in the dining market and people's school to ask everyone to calculate how much grain their families had and how long they could eat it. After such mobilization, the masses were afraid and worried. When mobilized, his quick clapper was:

    It hasn't rained for more than half a year,
    The prices of various grains have risen.
    Rice prices rise, wheat prices rise,
    The rise makes the old and young afraid.
    Prevent famine and prepare for drought,
    Weaving and transportation work together.
    Dig wild vegetables for long-term calculations,
    Saving and thrift should be done immediately.

    V. Promoting Everyone to Plant Vegetables in Large Quantities After the Rain
    It rained, and the solar term was already late. The government called for planting a large number of vegetables. Old Qin said: This year's harvest is not good, so we must plant more vegetables to make a living. The quick clapper he compiled was:

    The rain is late, don't give up,
    Plant red and white radishes in large quantities.
    Each person plants a third of an acre, the government has regulations,
    Cadres come to inspect, the team leader is responsible.
    Raise seedlings, apply manure,
    Guarantee to make a living in autumn.
    Red radish with side dishes,
    It's not bad to have this to eat.

    After this propaganda, everyone in the village completed a third of an acre of vegetable land.

    VI. Accumulating Fertilizer to Plant Wheat
    The land has been weeded. It's time to plant wheat, and the government called for seizing the time to plant. So he promoted the accumulation of fertilizer throughout the village. Because this year is a bad year, the autumn harvest is not good, and the people are looking forward to a good May harvest next year. Only more fertilizer, the quick clapper he compiled was:

    After the Autumn Equinox, hang up the hoe,
    Sharpen the sickle and go up the mountain ditch.
    Cut yellow artemisia and cut black artemisia,
    Cut them into big loads and carry them home.
    Carry them home and use a knife to chop them,
    Water is splashed, and soil is pressed,
    It turns white in ten days.
    Some carry, some carry on their backs,
    Apply fertilizer in time for the "May."
    No need to look forward to it, no need to calculate it,
    Eat white noodles in May.
    Willing to rush, finely cut,
    Spring girl, willow leaves.
    Willing to push, willing to knead,
    Willing to steam, willing to bake,
    Casual "Conscious."

    This mobilization village on the road, on the edge of the manure field, are full of manure piles, everyone is ready to plant wheat well.

    VII. Mobilizing Children and Women to Go to School
    Qin Yi is not only active in production propaganda, but also has significant achievements in helping schools mobilize children to enroll and breaking through parents' thoughts.

    His brother's woman has a child named Zengji, who wanted to study, but her mother didn't let her, wanting her to pick up firewood. He mobilized her several times, saying, you work harder, get up early to sell cloth and buy coal, but she didn't listen. Old Qin compiled a quick clapper for her:

    Zengji's mother doesn't change,
    Doesn't let the child study.
    Always asks her to pick up firewood every day,
    This path must be planned.
    Can't write, can't count,
    Children will say you are a fool when they grow up.

    This persuaded and mobilized his mother, and Zengji became a regular student. All the children in the village went home talking about his quick clapper, and in a few days the school increased to seventy or eighty regular students. He constantly went to the school to encourage children to study, and participated in children's activities every meeting, and sent children home. Because the villages were scattered, he saw the weaving team when he arrived at the school and said to them:

    The Eighth Route Army is the best,
    Men and women go to school at will.
    Girls carry the cart,
    Boys take the inkstone.
    If there is paper, write imitation,
    If there is no paper, do it on the ground.
    Everyone gets a card,
    Learn it and come to exchange it.

    But some families were not very happy, and the women were unwilling to go to school. He compiled another quick clapper:

    Mutual aid teams rely on voluntariness,
    Fathers and mothers are willing to carry carts to spin thread.
    Weave cloth and spin cotton,
    Don't want to go home when at school.
    Spin more, spin beautifully,
    Sooner or later, there will be no shortage of paper money, and also learn to read and write.

    In this way, if the women's families didn't let them come, they had to come. Their enthusiasm was even greater, and they went to school early.

    VIII. Promoting Cadre Learning
    The cadres in his village were illiterate, and he called on them to become literate. The cadres said, "We are too old, it won't work." He said, "Chairman Mao is so capable and still studies, why don't we study." In this way, the village cadres competed with him, and in less than a month the village chief could write letters of introduction, and the political director could write road passes. In this way, a total of five or six people achieved results. Twenty-three militiamen and women also made learning plans and notebooks.

    There was a dining market at his door, and he asked everyone to learn to read every day, but many people were useless. One day it rained, and he ran to the school before dawn, asking the teacher to write him a road pass. He learned it in half a day, wrote it back and said to everyone on the street, whoever wants to open a pass can come to me. Some said: You are putting on airs, you herded sheep all your life, how can you open a pass? He immediately took out a piece of white lime and wrote on the ground for everyone to read. From then on, these people said, it is still useful, and the idea that it was useless was completely broken, and a literacy plan was drawn up. Qin Yi took a large door panel from his home and hung it at the door to write on, which became a classroom for farmers.

    Qin Yi worked so hard that even his family was affected. Three of the four people in his family are models. His daughter, Eighteen, is studying in middle school, and his son, Zhou Shan, is a model in school. Therefore, the people said, Old Qin Yi is really capable, three of the four people in his family are models, and his woman is sick every other day, otherwise she would also be a model.

    Why is it that no matter what Old Qin Yi compiles, it suits everyone's taste and achieves remarkable achievements? In terms of methods, and composition, he never uses strikes, but enlightenment, not administrative style, but touches the hearts of the masses, solves problems ideologically, and comes up with solutions. No matter where they go, they are willing to approach him. No matter where they go, everyone competes to ask Qin Yi to say quick clappers, and he has become the people's master of quick clapper propaganda.

　　快板宣传家老秦易
    侯振南
    秦易是林县八区南景色村人，今年四十九岁，从小家很贫苦，十二岁上给人家放羊，一直放到二十八岁。他回忆在放羊时到处没有人看得起，成天在山上下不来，刮风下雨也没得人替自己，一年四季总是这样，夏天挨雨淋，冬天挨冻，羊到山坡上难免吃些田苗，但有没吃，别人远远望见也要白白骂一顿，在家里受羊主打骂，到地里也受别人的闲气，非常难过这不用说，想找一个对象也没人愿意，妇女们见了秦易说：“谁嫁给放羊汉，三年守寡二年半，十冬腊月还得守羊圈。”他对妇女们说：“谁嫁给放羊汉，光得吃羊肉抄干饭。”也没人理他，后因时间太长，秦易觉得没熬头。于是二十九岁回家，卖起柳货来，一直卖了四五年，虽维持不了生活，但总觉得比以前强，先不先不受别人打骂。下雨刮风有个住处。后来到作坊当了羊毛经纪，自己买了一个纺车回到家，纺些线，民国三十二年，八路军过来了，入了农会，和地主算帐、斗争、领导群众翻了身，现在家里四口人，分得七亩地，十几石粮，二千五百元，还有各样家具，在村上各种工作都积极，取得了广大群众拥护，领导生产，非常愉快，下面便是他在各种工作中的宣传和鼓动工作：
    一、在锄麦中
    在锄麦时组织互助组，当时有些村干部说：“我们斗争了几年地主土地也少，没心劲去生产，上边就叫生产，又有生产主任何必我们来管。”秦易说：我们干部的任务第一步领导大家翻身，第二步是领导生产，经他动员说服后，村干部的情绪也高起来，又讨论如何互助才能弄好，他给大家编了一段快板：
    村干部，要发展，
    推动全村大生产。
    互助组怎样办，
    大家听我谈一遍。
    一条要民主，
    二条要自愿。
    三条要等价，
    四条要交换。
    五条要积极，
    六条选模范。
    经过这个宣传，他这个行政村几天内组织了五十二个互助组。他又到各组各地检查把好的到处广播，有问题大家商量解决，好的组，他又编了个快板表扬，编的是：
    ××组搞的好，
    折工办法都做到。
    按力来评功，
    一天一开票。
    好的要广播，
    大家都知道。
    互助能省工，
    利益都得到。
    搞的好，搞的漂，（漂亮的意思）
    县政府能登报。
    模范得奖励，
    光荣都知道。
    经过这样的鼓动，大家的互助情绪劲头也越来越大。有的说起早搭黑也要争一个模范，但有的个别组也垮了台，主要的原因是时间长没算帐，他为了把这些组从新整顿起来，他就又编出了个快板：
    有的组垮了台，
    参加互助都不来。
    都不来怎样办，
    组长召集把帐算。
    你也算，我也算，
    分厘毫丝都不欠。
    把帐算，都不欠，
    咱这互助有改善。
    经过了这样，有垮了的，赶快清算帐目，重新组织，都恢复起来了，有个别的人自私，影响了互助组不巩固，他又给编的快板：
    有号人不可说，
    参加互助他不自觉。
    给他锄光嫌少，
    人家地里他说多。
    这号人说的漂，
    迟早嘴和心不照。
    你打套我打套，
    互助组里永不要。
    经过了他的快板宣传，那些自私人，都觉悟起来了，在三四天内全村二三千亩麦地都锄过来了。
    二、推动大家点种棉花
    正该点种棉花时，天旱没雨，政府叫各村大量种棉，秦易到处给大家说光种粮不种棉不行，叫早种能多收，召开大会进行动员，叫妇女儿童抬水点种，天不明就上庙打钟把全村轰动起来了，抬的抬，担的担，他为了鼓动妇女儿童情绪，说的快板是：
    抬着水，快快跑，
    生产赶上×××，
    你也跑我也跑，
    保险秋后换新袄。
    你不跑我不动，
    保管秋天要受冻。
    他到各处检查推动，提高了大家情绪，儿童也是到处唱，他见了妇女说的是：
    妇女队，要发家，
    组织起来种棉花。
    泡上种叫出芽，
    背起镢把种下。
    种棉想种好，
    第一争取下种早。
    种花深浅最作难，
    互助来了老年团。
    老年团说一遍，
    最深不过二指半。
    在他这样宣传鼓舞下，大家也知道了如何种，全村都卷入了点种，共点种了一百三十四亩棉田。
    三、推动生产与参战结合
    村上劳力都到汤阴参战，村里剩的是妇女儿童老年，老年还每天往前线送米面，他在家里帮助军属担水种菜，号召动员保证参战人员家里都种上菜。他的宣传鼓动口号是：
    生产主任可街跑，
    生产优军要搞好。
    犁过地种上花，
    栽红薯种南瓜。
    春苗等等按的净，
    赶上小驴去送粪。
    多少粪送的光，
    赶上小驴上前方。
    上前方送米面，
    军队吃了加劲干，
    前方大胜利，
    后方生产不困难。
    四、节约备荒
    旱灾将形成，政府号召各村组织生产防旱备荒叫大家节约，但老百姓大吃二喝，说：八路军不叫饿死人不要紧，秦易每到各地号召，饭市上民校里利用各种会议，叫大家计算家里有多少粮食能吃到什么时候。经过了这样的动员，群众害了怕，发了愁。动员起来了，他的快板是：
    多半年天不下，
    各样粮食都涨价。
    米涨价麦涨价，
    涨的老少都害怕。
    又防荒又备旱，
    纺织运输一齐干。
    揄野菜长期算，
    俭省节约马上办。
    五、雨后推动大家大批种菜
    下了雨，气节已经晚了，政府号召叫大量种菜，老秦说：今年年景不好，得多种菜顾命，编的快板是：
    下雨迟，莫泄劲，
    红白萝卜大批种。
    一人种三分政府有规定，
    干部来检查组长负责任。
    养出苗，上清粪，
    保险秋后能顾命。
    红萝卜配小菜，
    有这吃，也不赖。
    经过这个宣传，全村每人完成了三分菜地。
    六、积肥种麦
    地都锄过来。该种麦，政府号召叫抓紧种，他便推动全村积肥。因为今年是孬年景，秋收不行，老百姓都盼着明年好收五月，只有多上粪，他编的快板是：
    立了秋挂锄钩，
    磨磨镰上山沟。
    割黄蒿割黑蒿，
    割成大担往家挑。
    挑到家使刀铡，
    水又泼，土又压，
    十天发的白不得。
    担的担，驮的驮，
    按茬粪好“五月。”
    不用盼不用算，
    到在五月吃白面。
    愿赶哩，细切哩，
    春姑姑柳叶哩。
    愿推哩愿捏哩，
    愿蒸哩愿烙哩，　
    随随便便“自觉哩”
    这一动员村上的路口上，路边粪场里，都是满满的粪堆，大家准备要好好的种麦子了。
    七、动员儿童妇女上学
    秦易不仅是对于生产宣传积极，对于帮助学校动员儿童入学，打通家长思想，也有显著的成绩。
    他兄弟女人一个孩子叫增吉，想去学念书他娘不叫，要叫孩子拾柴，他动员了几次说，你多努力一下，起早卖布买煤她不听，老秦给他编了个快板：
    增吉他娘不转变，
    不叫孩把书念。
    天天光叫去拾柴，
    这个道路得打算。
    不会写，不会算，
    儿童长大了说你一辈糊涂蛋。
    这样说服动员了他娘，增吉成了一个经常生，全村儿童都回到家里说着他的快板，不到几天学校增加到七八十个经常生。他不断去学校鼓励儿童学习，每开会都参加儿童活动，送儿童回家，因村庄分散，他到了学校见了纺织组就给他们说：
    八路军最好干，
    男女上学都随便。
    女生搬着车，
    男生取着砚。
    有纸就写仿，
    没纸地下干。
    每人领个牌，
    学会就来换。
    但是有些家不很高兴，妇女都不愿到学校学习，他又编了个快板：
    互助组靠自愿，
    爹也愿娘也愿搬着车子来纺线。
    又织布又纺花，
    到在学校不想家。
    纺的多纺的漂，
    迟早不缺纸洋票，认字写字也学到。
    这样一来，妇女们家里不叫来，非来不行，她们劲头更大，早早就去了学校了。
    八、推动干部学习
    他村上干部不识字，他号召都识字，干部们说：“年纪大了，不行。”他说：“毛主席那样大的本事还学习啦，为什咱们不学习。”这样一来村干部就和他比赛起来，不到一个月村长会写介绍信，政治主任会开路条，这样共有五六个人学到了成绩，民兵妇女二十三人，也订学习计划订了笔记本。
    他的门口有个饭市，他每天叫大家学习识字，有很多人都不顶事，一天下了雨，他天不明跑到学校里，叫教员给他写个路条，半天学会了，写回去到街上给大家说，谁开条来找我就行，有的说：你出洋像，放了一辈羊，还能开条哩，他马上掏出白石灰块往地下写给大家念，从此后，这些人说，还是顶事，把不顶事想法彻底打破了，订出了识字计划。秦易从家里拿出一个大门扇挂在门口写上字，成了农民的课堂。
    秦易这样努力，连他家里的人也影响好了，他家里四口人就有三口人是模范，女子十八在中学习，儿子叫周山，在学校念书两个都是模范，所以老百姓说，老秦易真能干，一家四口人，三个是模范，女人三天两头病，不然也是个模范。
    老秦易为什么不论编出什么，却句句合乎大家口味，并取得了显著的成就呢？他在方式方法上，编作上，从来不是用打击的，而是启发的，不是行政作风，而摸群众心事，从思想上解决问题，想出办法，他们不管到那里都愿意接近他。不论到那里都一见了秦易谁都争叫说快板，他就成了群众的快板宣传家了。
