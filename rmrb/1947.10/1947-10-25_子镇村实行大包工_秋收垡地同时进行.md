　　Zizhen Village Implements Large-Scale Contracting
  　Autumn Harvest and Land Preparation Conducted Simultaneously
    [This newspaper, Licheng News] In order to complete the autumn harvest and autumn plowing and catch up with wheat planting ahead of schedule, Zizhen Village first convened a meeting of poor and tenant farmers to discuss how to start and how to save time. Everyone immediately suggested, "If we want to save labor and complete the work early, we should implement large-scale land contracting. First, according to the number of mu of land, the quality of the crops, and the distance from home, we should evaluate the labor points. Then, we should organize labor to carry out a concentrated effort, so that we can work on one piece of land in exchange for another." The leadership seized on this conclusion and then convened a mass meeting to let everyone discuss this method. At first, the liberated farmer Yang Jinshui did not understand, saying: "If land is entered as labor, the grain must be handed over to public custody, and we can only eat one grain at a time, which is not as good as using labor tickets as before." The cadres immediately explained the benefits of labor entry to him, and explained that the harvested grain would not be handed over to public custody, and only then did he believe that it was for his own benefit. After his thinking was straightened out, the masses deliberated and matured, and the cadres returned to the groups and teams they originally participated in to take the lead in evaluating the points. First, each group found a standard plot of land (general), and evaluated the points according to the labor time. At the beginning, in the darkness of night, the mutual aid groups reported their own labor figures. Everyone discussed and evaluated the specific figures based on the standards, comparing the quality of the crops, and whether it was labor-saving or labor-intensive, and then let everyone provide opinions. The cadres listened to the reflections from all parties and then conducted a re-evaluation. After the points were determined, the mutual aid organizations were reorganized. Harvesting teams, plowing teams, manpower and animal power coordination teams, technical leadership teams (specializing in leading auxiliary labor), and carrying teams were organized according to the strength of their abilities. On the 20th day of the eighth lunar month, the work officially began. It was proposed that animal power should not be used for transporting crops and threshing, and livestock should be used solely for plowing. It was calculated that harvesting, clearing land, stubble cultivation, and carrying all used human labor, and it was also calculated that livestock was used for plowing. It was discovered that there was not enough livestock power to be distributed, and the harvest and cultivation could not be completed simultaneously. It was necessary to organize human labor to dig the land. The labor for harvesting was completed twelve days earlier than plowing. Each laborer dug 0.4 mu per day. It was planned to organize labor, and digging could reduce livestock power by six days. In this way, the harvesting and cultivation work could be completed by the 14th day of the ninth month.

    [This newspaper] On the 13th night, a meeting of cadres, heroes, poor farmers, and activists was convened in Nancun, Licheng, to specifically discuss the intensive autumn plowing. First, a review was conducted of the leadership's failure to grasp the situation well last autumn, with disorganized division of labor and work recording. For example, Wang Yueqin said: "Last autumn, we didn't divide the work of plowing well, and as a result, the households that finished plowing first couldn't engage in transportation, and the groups that weren't actively plowing then changed their labor to plow, which affected the early completion of autumn plowing and the start of sideline production. We must correct this problem this year." Yuan Laohu said: "Accepting the lessons of last autumn, I think we should evaluate the quality of the livestock, the distance of the land, and whether it's easy or difficult to plow, and organize contracting for plowing, which will not only plow the land quickly, but also not delay transportation after the autumn harvest." After discussion, a method of contracting for plowing according to the land and the distance was established: those within 1.5 li plow 1 mu and record 13 work points, those between 1.5 li and 2.5 li plow 1 mu and record 17 work points, those between 2.5 li and 3.5 li plow 1 mu and record 18 work points, those between 3.5 li and 4 li plow 1 mu and record 20 work points, and those beyond 4 li are recorded according to the actual labor (including manual labor). For small plots of land less than 1 mu, an additional 2 work points are added for each mu plowed (1 work point is deducted for each mu of corn plowed, because corn land is easy to plow without stubble). The village has 1,620 mu of autumn land (including 120 mu of rapeseed land). In order to complete the autumn plowing early, prevent the ground from freezing, and give full play to the enthusiasm of livestock for autumn plowing, the village's 29 pairs of livestock were divided into first, second, and third grades according to the quality and strength of the mules, horses, donkeys, and cattle. The tasks of each pair of livestock were discussed by the households with livestock and the plowmen. First-grade livestock was required to plow 3 mu per day, second-grade 2.5 mu, and third-grade 2 mu. Each pair of livestock competed with each other to plow quickly and well.

　　子镇村实行大包工
  　秋收垡地同时进行
    【本报黎城讯】子镇村为了提前完成秋收秋耕赶麦，首先召开贫雇农会议，讨论如何着手，怎样节省时间，大家当即提出“要想省工早完成，实行土地大包工，首先根据土地亩数，庄稼好坏，距家远近，评出用工分数，然后组织劳力突击，这样可以一块换一块的动手”。领导上抓紧这个结论，接着召开群众会，让大家讨论这个办法，首先就遇到翻身农民杨金水思想不通，说：“土地入工，粮食一定要交公保管，吃一颗领一颗，不如照旧用工票好。”干部即给他解释入工的好处，并说明打下粮食不交公保管，他才相信是为了自己。经打通思想，群众酝酿成熟后，干部各自回到自己原参加的组与队去带头，领导评分，首先各组找下标准地（一般的），根据用工时间评定分数。开始黑夜在互助组自报用工数目，大家根据标准，对比庄稼好坏，省工费工，讨论评议出具体数目，再让大家提供意见，干部从各方听反映，再进行复评。分数确定后，接着整顿了互助组织。又以能力强弱，组织收割股，犁地股，人畜调剂股，技术领导股（专门领导辅助劳力），扁担队。阴八月二十日正式开始动手，提出运庄稼打场一概不用畜力，抽出牲口单纯耕地。计算收割、腾地、打茬、担全用人力，又计算畜力耕地，发现畜力不够分配，收耕不能一致完成，必须组织人力刨地，劳力收割比耕地早完成十二日，每一劳力每日刨地四分，计划组织劳力，刨能减少畜力六天，这样，收耕工作于九月十四日可全部完成。（双贤）
    【本报讯】黎城南村十三日夜召开干部英雄贫农积极分子会议，专门讨论突击秋垡地。首先检讨了去年秋领导没有掌握好，分工记工零乱，如王月芹说：“去年秋天咱垡地没分好工，结果先耕完地的户也不能搞运输，不积极耕地的组再变工耕，结果影响了提前完成秋耕，和开始搞副业。今年必须纠正这毛病”。原老虎说：“接受去秋教训，我觉着咱是将牲口好坏，地远近，好垡不好垡，都进行评议，组织包工垡地，又能快垡地，也不误秋后搞运输。”大家讨论，订出了按地按里包工垡茬办法：一里半以内者耕一亩记十三分工，一里半至二里半者耕一亩十七分，二里半至三里半者十八分，三里半至四里者二十分，四里以外者是以工记工（人工在内），一亩以下小块者，每耕一亩增加二分工（玉茭每耕一亩扣一分，玉茭因地没茬好耕）。全村秋地一千六百二十亩（内有一百二十亩油菜地），为了秋耕早完成，防止地上冻，发挥畜力积极秋耕，又将全村二十九犋牲口按骡马驴牛畜力的好坏强弱分为一、二、三等，分工耕地，一等牲口有十二犋，二等六犋，三等十一犋，经各户有牲口和掌犁人又讨论出各犋牲口的任务，头等每犋每天要耕到三亩，二等二亩半，三等二亩。各犋与各犋提出竞赛，要做到耕的快，耕的好。（黎城小报）
