　　Taihang First Special District Directive:
  　Vigorously Organize the Masses to Survive the Famine
    [This Dispatch] Due to various disasters such as drought, insects, locusts, hail, wind, and rain in the Taihang First Special District, a famine has formed throughout the district, except for a few areas where the situation is relatively mild. The most severely affected is Jingxing, where the average harvest is only 15% of a normal year. With burdens not counted, the average autumn harvest per person is 3.6 *dou* (市斗) of coarse grains. Currently, 10,000 people are already starving, and by the end of the year, 50,000 people will have nothing to eat. Other areas, such as Zan, Lin, and the old liberated areas of Yuanshi, are also quite serious. In total, the entire district will be short of 900,000 to 1,000,000 *shi* of grain until next summer. Based on this situation, the Special Commissioner's Office has made the following decisions: 1. Currently, we should seize the opportunity of "one season equaling three autumns," using poor peasants and farm laborers as the backbone, to solve their difficulties and plant wheat on a large scale, striving to plant one-third to one-half of the land, and in some areas, striving to plant three-fifths to two-thirds. We must also seize the opportunity to collect substitute foods and store bran and vegetables. Even in areas with milder famine, we must seize the opportunity. We call on Xingtai, Gao, Nei, and the border areas of Yuanshi to launch a campaign to support Jingxing with 1.5 million *jin* of bran and vegetables. 2. Vigorously organize two 100-day textile movements this winter and next spring, and strive to complete 6 million *jin* of homespun cloth to solve the problem of 550,000 *shi* of famine relief grain. 3. Organize winter transportation to facilitate the exchange of goods, and strive to transport 400,000 *shi* of famine relief grain. Each county should, based on local and surrounding conditions, specifically help the masses to study and organize ways to find work, and should focus on solving the difficulties of the disaster areas. Economic departments should pay attention to opening up roads and taking the lead in transportation. In order to coordinate with other districts, we plan to set up warehouses in other districts. After the autumn harvest, we must universally repair major roads and determine the construction of the Zan-Xi and Xing-He highways to facilitate transportation. We should universally establish and transform small roadside shops with stoves to facilitate lodging for the masses, providing complete fodder. We should promote the sale of yellow steamed bread and mixed noodles, and the shops in the markets should also be transformed in accordance with this spirit. 4. The leadership should, based on local conditions and the habits of the masses, start from specific situations and concentrate on promoting mass creativity, and should not carry out general arrangements. For mountainous areas, we can organize charcoal burning; in eastern Xingtai, we can organize the masses to weave mats, etc. (Wang Yi)

　　太行一专指示
  　大力组织群众渡荒
    【本报讯】太行一分区由于旱、虫、蝗、雹、风、雨各种灾情，除个别地区较轻外，全区灾荒已经形成，最重的是井陉，全县平均一成半年景，负担不计，每人平均秋收三斗六升（市斗）粗粮，目前已有一万人饿肚，年底即有五万人没得吃。其他如赞、临，及元氏老区也相当严重，总计全区约有四十万至五十万灾民到明夏尚缺九十万至一百万石粮。根据这样情况，专署特作如下决定：一，当前应抓紧“一季三秋”，以贫雇为骨干，解决他们的困难大量种麦，争取种到三分之一至二分之一，个别地区争取种到五分之三至三分之二。采集代食品及储蓄糠菜，在灾荒较轻地区也要抓紧，号召邢、高、内，及元氏边地，发动一个支援井陉一百五十万斤糠菜运动。二、大力组织今冬明春两个百日纺织运动，为完成六百万斤土布解决五十五万石渡荒粮而斗争。三、组织冬季运输沟通有无，为四十万石渡荒谷而努力。各县要根据当地及周围条件具体帮助群众研究组织给劳力找出路，并应抓住重点解决灾区困难，经济部门应注意开辟道路带头运输。为了和外区配合计划在外区设立货栈。秋收后要普修大路，确定兴修赞、昔及邢、和两条大路便利运输在路上普遍建立改造便于群众住宿的起火小店要草料俱全，提倡卖黄蒸、杂面，集市上的店房也要依此精神改造。四、领导上应根据各地条件和群众习惯，从具体情况出发集中发扬群众创造，不应一般的进行布置。为山地可组织烧木炭，邢台东可组织群众编席等。（王毅）
