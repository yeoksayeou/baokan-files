　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Following the Weidemaier [Wedemeyer] mission, which was extremely insulting to China in its aggression and aid to Chiang Kai-shek, another group of American imperialists, a Congressional military delegation, has arrived in China for a "visit." This delegation, composed of members of the Military Subcommittee of the US House of Representatives, according to the US Information Service, includes the chairman of the committee, Republican Congressman Kerberston [Keberston] of Massachusetts, Republican Congressman Charles [Cha'er] of New York, Republican Congressman Hesluyi [Hesluyi] of Ohio, Democratic Congressman Heberson [Heberson] of Louisiana, and Democratic Congressman Nobula [Nobula] of Oregon. Republican Congressman Skrili Shina [Shikelishi Na] of the House Appropriations Committee and Brigadier General Blisse [Bulisi], Surgeon General of the US Army, are also accompanying them. It is said that their "visit" locations include not only Beiping [Peiping], but also Qingdao, Nanjing, Shanghai, etc. The delegation is scheduled to fly to Qingdao today (the 8th). According to Reuters, the purpose of the delegation's "visit" to China is to inspect "the equipment of the US Army and Navy" in China. The US Information Service claims that it is "to visit the US Army and Navy Advisory Group," but also mentions that the delegation inspected the US "Army and Navy equipment" there during its stay in Seoul. This indicates that the delegation's visit to China is related to the affairs of US military bases in China. Since Japan's surrender until Weidemaier [Wedemeyer]'s arrival in China, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek has sold to the United States or the United States has actually controlled naval and air force bases in Qingdao, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Tianshui, Chengdu, Dihua [Urumqi], Taipei, Keelung, Kaohsiung, Huangpu, Shanghai and other places. Recently, the Chiang bandit [Chiang Kai-shek] authorities, who do not hide their traitorous face of "fighting for the United States," plan to immediately hand over the port of Yantai, which the People's Liberation Army has just withdrawn from, to their American masters to make it a US military base for aggression against China.

　　美国会军事考察团来华
  　视察侵华基地
    【新华社陕北八日电】继侵华援蒋极端侮辱中国的魏德迈使团来华之后，美国帝国主义另一派来中国“访问”之国会军事考察团，已于六日由朝鲜汉城到达北平。该团由美国众院军事小组委员会人员所组成，据美国新闻处公布，包括该委员会主席马萨诸塞州共和党众议员克伯逊，纽约共和党议员查尔、俄亥俄州共和党众议员赫斯鲁易、西安那民主党议员赫伯逊及奥勒冈、民主党众议员诺布拉，另有众院度支委员会共和党议员史克利失纳及美陆军总医官布利斯少将亦同来。据称，彼等“访问”地点，除北平外，尚有青岛、南京、上海等。该团定今（八）日飞青岛。该团“访”华目的，据路透社透露，系考察在华“美国陆军与海军之设备”，美国新闻处则宣称“为访问美国海陆军顾问集团”，但亦提到该团停驻汉城时曾视察美国在该地之“陆军与海军设备”。此表示该团之来华当与美国在华军事基地事务有关。按自日本投降以来至魏德迈来华期间，卖国贼蒋介石出卖给美国或已为美国实际控制之海空军基地已有青岛、西安、兰州、天水、成都、迪化、台北、基隆、高雄、黄埔、上海等地。最近毫不掩饰其“为美国而战”的卖国贼面目的蒋匪当局，并打算将人民解放军刚刚撤出的烟台港口，立即送给其美国主子，做美国侵略中国之军事基地。
