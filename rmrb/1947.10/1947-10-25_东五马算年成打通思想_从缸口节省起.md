　　Dongwuma Village Calculates the Harvest and Unifies Thought: Starting with Saving from the Granary
    [This newspaper, Pingshun dispatch] The masses of Dongwuma Village in the Fifth District knew that this year's autumn harvest was not good, but most felt that regardless of the harvest, they would still eat through the autumn. Therefore, when harvesting grain, they used coarse bran to fertilize the fields. Noticing this paralysis, a mass meeting of the entire village was immediately convened to discuss whether this year's autumn harvest was better than usual. Everyone believed that this year's autumn was a deceptive one. Wang Dafa said, "This spring, we rushed to plant the seedlings, but later there was hail that destroyed the crops. The bad harvest was already determined. This autumn can only yield 60% of last year's." When they calculated that their autumn harvest would not last even half a year, everyone began to worry. Wang Laiquan said, "I used to be a farmhand for more than ten years. I didn't care whether the harvest was good or bad. But since I became a landowner, I am afraid of starving to death when the harvest is bad. This year's harvest is truly bad, so we must save from the granary! Storing coarse bran can also help us overcome the famine. Saving a handful of grain every day is a long-term plan. Women at home should eat sparingly. Men should transport goods to earn rice to compensate for the poor harvest. Women should spin and weave while gathering wild vegetables, apricot leaves, and hemp leaves. Men should plow the land one more time to ensure a good seedling catch next spring." Wang Laiquan enlightened everyone's thinking, and broke the paralysis of "eating through the autumn regardless of the harvest." An old lady said, "I won't eat cornmeal for breakfast, I'll fill up with a handful of bran instead, to save grain for the future famine." After everyone's discussion, they collectively stored 150 *shi* of coarse bran. The benefit of collective storage is that it prevents the bran from rotting and spoilage. They selected a bran storage director to manage it. During the rush to harvest, the whole village changed 160 *mu* of wheat stubble in five days for an early harvest next year. Everyone said, "If we can plant more wheat, we can overcome the famine next year!" Each household planted an average of one *mu* of wheat. (Hai Zhong)

　　东五马算年成打通思想
  　从缸口节省起
    【本报平顺讯】五区东五马村群众，知道今年秋景不好，但大部分都感到收不收吧，总要吃一秋。所以收谷时就把粗油糠沤了粪。发现这些麻痹现象，就即时召开了全村群众会，讨论今年秋景是否比平常年强？大家认为今年的秋是假秋，王大法说：“今春抢垧下种捉住了苗，到后来又有冰雹，把庄稼打光了，坏年景已早就定了，今年秋只能顶去年六成收。”当计算了自己的秋收粮食吃不上半年时，大家在思想上才着了慌，王来全说：“过去住长工十几年，收秋不管他好和坏，自翻身后收秋不好心里就怕饿死，今年秋是真不好，缸口就得节省哩！存下粗油糠也能渡灾荒，每天节余一把粮，长期打算过时光，家里妇女吃时要细水长流，男人运输赚米补歉收，妇女纺织结合把野菜杏叶大麻叶子打，男人多耕一遍地，对明春捉苗也把稳。”王来全启发了大家思想，才打破了“收不收吃一秋”的麻痹思想。有一老太太说：“早上不吃黄疙瘩，早填一把糠，省的将来荒。”经大家讨论后，就集体积存粗谷糠一百五十石，集体存的好处是不怕沤了粪，也不怕烂，选了糠库主任专保管。全村在突击收秋时，为明年早接嘴，五天改茬麦子一百六十亩，大家说：“有垧多赶麦，明年能渡荒！”每户平均改了一亩麦。（海忠）
