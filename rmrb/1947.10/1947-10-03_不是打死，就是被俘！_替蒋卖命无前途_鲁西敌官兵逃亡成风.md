　　Either Killed or Captured!
　　Serving Chiang Kai-shek Offers No Future
　　Desertion Becomes Rampant Among Enemy Officers and Soldiers in Western Shandong
　　[Report from this newspaper] The weapons laid down by the Chiang Kai-shek army in the battles of Yangshanji and other areas in western Shandong further prove the low morale of the Chiang Kai-shek army. The Chiang Kai-shek army generally recognizes the truth that they will "either be killed or captured." This pessimistic, weary, and fearful mentality has caused Chiang Kai-shek's officers and soldiers to desert in droves. Bao Jintang, a lieutenant platoon leader of the guard company of the 280th Regiment of the 70th Division, said: "When we set off for the front this time, seven communication officers from our regiment's service company ran away, and Chen Shiyan, the deputy company commander of the Fourth Company, also deserted. Everyone knows that going to the front means either being killed or captured. The company commander didn't dare to go to the front during this battle, and as expected, he collapsed as soon as the fighting started." Yue Zhenhua, a lieutenant military doctor of the 553rd Regiment of the 185th Brigade of the 66th Division, said: "Desertion is most rampant among the soldiers in our unit, and many officers are also deserting. Yuan Chufan, the lieutenant colonel deputy regimental commander of our regiment, ran away before even reaching the front line this time. Everyone wants to ask for leave to go home, but it's not allowed." Yang Yuzhen, a lieutenant reconnaissance platoon leader of the 413th Regiment of the 141st Brigade of the 32nd Reorganized Division, also said: "No one there (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek army) wants to be a company commander because they are afraid of being killed in battle. Now many officers are deserting and changing careers. When we were transferred from northern Henan to western Shandong this time, not to mention the soldiers who ran away on the way, two platoon leaders from our regiment alone ran away, one being Shi Delong, a second lieutenant platoon leader of the Seventh Company, and the other being Cui Kezhen, a lieutenant platoon leader of the Ninth Company. On April 3rd this year, when fighting the People's Liberation Army in Jixian, Zhao Weixin, the company commander of the Second Company, was killed, but the superiors didn't even provide a coffin. Who would want to continue working there? Because desertion has become rampant, the junior officers there are already feeling the lack of personnel." Furthermore, the fact that some Chiang Kai-shek army officers have been captured twice further illustrates this truth. Lieutenant Bao Jintang of the 70th Division was liberated once in Shandong in January of this year. At that time, he was a lieutenant platoon leader of the 506th Regiment of the 169th Brigade of the 26th Division. He was liberated again after only half a year. Su Ming, who was liberated in northern Henan, was the squad leader of the Second Machine Gun Company of the 595th Regiment of the 199th Brigade of the 66th Division. He returned to the Chiang-controlled area on June 27th, and on July 22nd, the People's Liberation Army released him from detention for the second time in Yangshanji. These facts further prove that the Chiang Kai-shek army cannot escape the fate of being annihilated, and that the officers and soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek army are unwilling to die for the Chiang gang, and its internal disintegration is not far off.

### 不是打死，就是被俘！　替蒋卖命无前途　鲁西敌官兵逃亡成风

　　不是打死，就是被俘！
  　替蒋卖命无前途
  　鲁西敌官兵逃亡成风
    【本报讯】从鲁西羊山集等战役放下武器的蒋军军队口令中益发证明了蒋军士气的低落。蒋军中普遍的认识到他们“不是打死，就是被俘”的真理，这是悲欢厌恶恐惧的心理，造成蒋军官兵的纷纷逃亡。七十师一四○旅二八○团警卫中尉排长鲍锦堂便说：“这次出发到前线上来，我们团里勤务连就跑了七个管通讯的官，四连副连长陈世燕也开了小差。谁都晓得，到前面来，不是打死，就是被俘，这次打仗当连长部不敢上前头去，果然也就一打就垮了。”六十六师一八五旅五五三团上尉军医岳振华说：“在我们部队士兵逃的最凶，官逃的也不少，我们团的中校副团长袁楚藩，在这次没开到前线就跑了。谁都想请假回家，就是不准假。”整三十二师一四一旅四一三团中尉搜索排长杨裕祯也说：“那边（指蒋军）谁都不想干连长，原因是怕战死。现在当官的逃亡转业的多得很。我们这次从豫北调鲁西，半路上跑的士兵就不说，只我们团里的排长就跑了两个，一个是七连少尉排长师德龙，一个是九连中尉排长崔克镇。今年四月三日，在汲县和人民解放军作战时，二连连长赵维新打死了，上级连个棺材都不给，谁还愿意干下去？因为逃亡成风，那边的下级军官已经感到缺乏。”再从一些蒋军军官的二次被俘事实当中，更能说明这一真理，七十师鲍锦堂中尉便是今年元月在山东被解放过一次的，那时他是二十六师一六九旅五○六团的中尉排长，仅只半年时期又获解放，在豫北解放的苏明是六十六师一九九旅五九五团机二连的班长，他六月二十七日回到蒋管区，七月二十二日便被人民解放军在羊山集把他从拘押中二次释放过来，这些事实益证明，蒋军逃脱不了被歼的命运，蒋军官兵均不愿为蒋贼效死，其内部的分崩离析就在不远了。
