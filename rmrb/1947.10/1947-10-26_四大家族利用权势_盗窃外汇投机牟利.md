Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. A broadcast by the Central News Agency from the 5th to the 11th stated that the "Report on the Use of Foreign Exchange and the Business Conditions of Various Companies" issued by the Chiang Kai-shek's Control Yuan once again exposed the despicable acts of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in relying on special privileges to speculate and make a fortune. The report announced that the Chiang government "originally had six million ounces (approximately equivalent to six million taels of gold in China, and more than 900 million US dollars. From the time of Japan's surrender to November of last year, most of it was consumed by the import of non-constructive materials, and it was wasted by the former Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen alone in approving its use." It also cited that Song Ziwen, during his tenure as Executive Yuan President, not only casually issued hand notes to waste foreign exchange funds, but also telegraphed the Central Trust Bureau in July of last year, when automobile imports were prohibited, to purchase 190 automobiles with 500,000 US dollars in foreign exchange, allocating two-fifths to private individuals in order to obtain more than ten times the profit and embezzle the money (the report stated that the purchase price of each automobile was only around 10 million Chiang Kai-shek currency, while the market price was more than ten times higher). The report also stated that Song Ziliang's (Song Ziwen's brother) Fuzhong Company obtained a huge amount of foreign exchange, more than 50 percent of which was used to order automobiles in the United States. Among the 780 automobiles ordered, 738 were imported after the ban on imports on April 29, 1946, and 580 were ordered after the ban on imports. The company also used the name of its New York branch to evade taxes, hide profits, and conceal the true nature of its business. In addition to having similar fraudulent relationships with its American branch, Kong Lingkan's (Kong Xiangxi's son) Yangzi Jianye Company also illegally purchased prohibited imports such as powder, perfume, and other cosmetics. The heads of these two companies, such as Song Ziliang, the current general manager of Fuzhong Company, went abroad in July 1940 under the guise of being a special envoy to the United States to study transportation; Shen Henian, the current associate manager of the company, went abroad in April 1942 under the guise of being Song Ziwen's attendant secretary; and Song Zi'an, the current general manager of the Construction Bank Company, went abroad in November 1941 under the guise of being a secretary in Chiang Kai-shek's Military Affairs Commission's attendant office, all using their obtained diplomatic passports to engage in commercial activities in the United States and have not yet returned. The Chiang's Four Families' private property China Trust Bureau and the Material Supply Bureau, World Trade Corporation, etc., used their access to foreign exchange and transportation, or took advantage of the fact that they did not have to go through certain customs declaration procedures to purchase prohibited items such as automobiles and refrigerators. The report finally revealed that Chiang's bureaucrats participating in the Chiang Kai-shek government's National Economic Commission engaged in speculation by taking advantage of insider information. For example, "In August, when the committee decided to change the official foreign exchange rate policy, some of the bureaucrats attending the meeting massively purchased US dollar short-term treasury bills before the foreign exchange rate was revised, in order to obtain huge profits." According to the report, the above-mentioned facts of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's private profit-making speculation have been constantly criticized by Chinese and foreign public opinion since March of this year. For example, in March of this year, the Associated Press accused the China Trust Bureau, Yitong Company, China Supply Bureau, and other Chiang family private companies of importing luxury goods such as automobiles, radios, and refrigerators, while the legitimate requests of private businesses were ignored by the Chiang Kai-shek authorities. The aviation industry claimed that most of the luxury goods purchased were sold through the Chiang family officials' commercial firms in order to line their own pockets. In July of this year, when Wedemeyer came to China, the CC Clique also dredged up the scandals of the Fuzhong and Yangzi companies stealing foreign exchange funds in order to attack Kong and Song. Secondly, the Associated Press pointed out when the Control Yuan's "report" was published: This summer, some people had accused certain "privileged companies" of obtaining more foreign exchange than they deserved and importing luxury goods that other companies were prohibited from importing.
    After the above-mentioned Control Yuan "report" was published, Zhang Qun, the Chiang Kai-shek's Executive Yuan President, publicly expressed dissatisfaction with it because the "report" excessively exposed the history of corruption of the Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique. During his "policy report" at the参政会 on the 19th, he said, "The soaring of the black market for foreign exchange" was "because the Control Yuan's report only mentioned the expenditure of foreign exchange, but not the income of foreign exchange," and also said, "The publication of the Control Yuan's report on the use of foreign exchange is also one of the reasons for stimulating price increases." This "accusation" aroused anger from the Control Yuan, and four members of the Control Yuan issued a written statement on the 24th, launching a counterattack against Zhang, saying: "The origin of this kind of rumor (referring to the point that the black market for foreign exchange and price increases were caused by the Control Yuan's report) should be that bureaucratic capitalists and their accomplices are deeply afraid that the Control Yuan and public opinion from all sides will be unfavorable to them, so they are using this smoke screen trick to create a false impression and continue to carry out their activities of obtaining illegal and excessive profits." The "statement" pointed to "the inevitable periodic phenomenon of currency inflation stimulating price increases" as the "main reason for the current soaring prices."

　　四大家族利用权势
  　盗窃外汇投机牟利
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】中央社五日至十一日广播，蒋匪监察院发表之“外汇使用及各公司营业情形报告书”，又一次暴露了蒋匪集团依仗特权投机发财之卑鄙勾当。该报告书宣布蒋政府“原存有六百万盎斯（约合中国六百万两黄金，与九亿以上之美金。在日本投降后至去年十一月间，大半消耗于非建设性物资之进口，且系由（蒋匪）前行政院长宋子文一人核准使用所浪费”。并举出宋子文在行政院长任期内，不仅随便开手条浪费外汇基金，且于去年七月间禁止汽车入口时期曾电令中央信托局，以外汇五十万美元购进汽车一百九十辆，以五分之二分配与私人，以取得十倍以上之厚利而中饱私囊（该报告书统计购进之汽车每辆只合蒋币一千万元上下，而市价较之高出十倍以上）。该报告书又称：宋子良（按系宋子文之弟）之孚中公司获得巨量外汇，百分之五十以上均用于在美订购汽车，所订之七百八十辆汽车中，有七百三十八辆系在一九四六年四月二十九日禁止入口以后进口者，且有五百八十辆系于禁止入口后所订购。该公司并利用纽约分公司之名义，逃避税捐，隐藏利润及营业的真情。孔令侃（孔祥熙之子）之扬子建业公司除与美国扬子分公司间也有同样舞弊关系外，也违法购进禁止入口之脂粉香水等化装品。该二公司之负责人，如孚中公司现任总经理宋子良，以派赴美国考察交通专使名义于一九四○年七月出国；该公司现任协理沈鹤年以宋子文侍从秘书名义于一九四二年四月出国；以及建设银行公司现任总经理宋子安，以蒋匪军委会侍从室秘书名义于一九四一年十一月间出国，均利用其所得之外交护照在美从事商业活动，至今未归。而蒋四大家族私产中信局及物资供应局，世界贸易公司等则利用拥有外汇及交通之便，或借不必经一定手续报关查验之便而购进汽车，冰箱等被禁物品。报告书于最后又泄露：参加蒋匪政府全国经济委员会之蒋家官僚，借消息之灵便从事投机。例如“八月间该会决定外汇官价政策之变更，若干参加会议之官僚，便于外汇改订前大量搜购美金短期库券，以获巨利。”按据该报告揭露：上述蒋匪集团营私投机之事实，自今年三月以来，即不断被中外舆论所指责。如今年三月间合众社指责中信局、一统公司、中国供应局等蒋家私产公司，均进口大│奢侈品汽车，无线电，冰箱之类，私人商行之正当请求，蒋匪当局却置之不理。航业界称，上述购进之奢侈品，大半由蒋家官员之商行经手出售，以饱私囊。今年七月间魏德迈来华时期，ＣＣ二陈为攻击孔宋也曾翻出孚中、扬子二公司盗窃外汇基金之黑幕。其次，合众社曾于监察院“报告书”发表时指出：今年夏季若干人即曾控告若干“特权公司”获得比他们应得的更多量的外汇，并输入其他公司被禁止输入的奢侈品。
    上述监察院“报告书”发表后，由于该“报告书”对蒋匪统治集团贪污丑史暴露过甚，蒋匪行政院长张群曾公开对之表示不满，彼于十九日在参政会作“施政报告”时说：“外汇黑市之暴涨”即“因监察院报告书中只提到外汇之支出，而不提外汇收入”，又说“监察院外汇使用报告书之公布，亦为刺激物价上涨原因之一”。此项“指责”引起监察院方面震怒，监察委员四人于二十四日发表书面谈话，向张施行反击，说：“此种谣言（指外汇黑市及物价上涨系由监院报告引起一点）之由来，当系官僚资本家及其爪牙，深恐监院及各方舆论有不利于彼等之处，故施此烟幕伎俩，以求发生错觉，而图继续进行其获取非法过份利润之活动”。该“谈话”将“目前物价暴涨之主要原因”指为“通货膨胀刺激物价上涨之必然周期现象”。
