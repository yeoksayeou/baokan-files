    Taihang Second Special District Studies Methods
    Helping Worker-Peasant Cadres Learn Culture
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Taihang Second Special District held a meeting of cadres and section members from various counties last month to study the issue of cultural learning for worker-peasant cadres. After the land reform, a large number of worker-peasant cadres participated in the work. Their political quality is very good, and they are active and responsible in their work, but because their cultural level is too low, it affects their work and progress. For example, worker-peasant cadres in Heshun × District received a notice in the township (mainly important documents). They couldn't understand it themselves and didn't dare to ask others to read it, so they had to run more than ten *li* back to the district to ask. Some could not summarize their work after they had done it, and some could not exchange experiences. This has caused distress for worker-peasant cadres and losses in their work. Some reflected that if they are illiterate, they have no future and will eventually collapse and return home. Some want to learn, but they don't have the ability to self-study, and they have no solution when they encounter difficulties. Therefore, they pessimistically say: Learning is useless; one is too old to learn after thirty. Some have acute impatience, wanting to learn everything, but learning nothing. Based on this situation, methods were studied: the leadership should focus on the district, take youth as the core, create models, establish banners for cultural learning, and conduct regular inspections and summaries. Educate intellectual cadres to help worker-peasant cadres learn, so that they recognize that helping workers and peasants improve culturally is also one of the revolutionary tasks. On the other hand, educate worker-peasant cadres to consciously make personal plans, such as recognizing one or two characters a day, adhering to the principle of learning whatever is needed for work, combining work and learning, and recognizing that learning is also for work. At the same time, overcome impatience and pessimism in learning. Based on their different cultural levels, make different learning plans, such as writing diaries, writing ordinary letters, and making simple work reports. In addition, each county should provide worker-peasant cadres with learning materials according to the actual cultural level of its cadres. (Qing Feng, Xiu De, Zai Qing)

    太行二专署研究办法
    帮助工农干部学文化
    【本报讯】太行二专署，上月召开各县干部科员会议，研究工农干部文化学习问题。土地改革后，大批工农干部参加了工作，政治质量很好，工作积极势负责，但因文化程度太低，以致影响工作和其进步。如和顺×区工农干部在乡接到通知后（主要文件），自己认不通，又不敢找别人认，只得大远十余里跑回区上问。有些做了工作总结不了，有经验交流不了，因此造成工农干部的苦恼和工作上的损失。有的反映咱不识字的没前途，将来还不是垮台回家；有的想学习，没有自学能力，一遇到困难就没办法了。于是悲观的说：学也不顶事啦，人过三十不学艺。有的害急性病，啥也想学，啥也学不会。根据这情况，研究出办法：领导上以区为重点，以青年为核心，创造典型树立学习文化旗帜，造成学习文化运动，按期检查总结。教育知识分子干部帮助工农干部学习，使其认识帮助工农在文化上提高，也是革命任务之一。另一方面教育工农干部自觉订出个人计划，如一天识一个字或二个字，本着做啥学啥的原则：把工作学习结合起来，认识学习也是为了工作，同时克服学习上的急性病和悲观情绪等。根据自己不同文化程度，订出不同学习计划，如写日记写普通信，作简单的工作汇报等。此外由各县根据其干部文化程度的实际情况，供给工农干部学习材料。（青风、修德、再青）
