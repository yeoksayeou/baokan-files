Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the United Press on the 2nd, citing mainland newspaper reports, market observers believe that the rising price trend in Shanghai is once again facing an "uncontrollable" situation. The newspaper reported: In the recent period, the average retail price of general commodities has increased by 60%, far exceeding the increase in foreign exchange rates. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the United Press on the 29th of last month: After the Chiang government raised the official market price of US dollars to 49,500 yuan on the 29th, the black market price of US dollars immediately surged from 61,000 yuan on the 27th to 63,000 yuan. At the same time, various public utilities in the Chiang area have successively increased their prices. According to a Reuters Shanghai dispatch on the 1st, starting from the 3rd, railways, shipping, postal and telecommunications, and other public utilities have all greatly increased or will increase their prices. Among them, train prices have increased by 100%, water transport fares have increased by 45% from the 1st, freight rates have increased by 25% to 30%, and postal and telecommunications have increased by 200%. In addition, although airline passenger and freight rates had already increased by 150% at the end of August after the implementation of the new foreign exchange measures, due to the continuous rise in gasoline prices, freight rates will now be increased again. At the same time, the prices of various goods in Shanghai have soared. The retail price of rice reached 660,000 yuan per dan on the 28th, and the price increase of daily necessities is also intense. Vegetable oil reached 1.2 million yuan per dan, 40-count Blue Phoenix yarn has broken through the 27 million yuan mark, and rayon per dan is approaching 50 million yuan. Chinese and foreign stocks have also risen across the board, showing a "completely red" phenomenon.

　　蒋区物价上涨不可收拾
  　美钞黑市达六万三
    【新华社陕北三日电】据合众社上海二日电引大陆报消息，市场观察家认为上海物价涨风又已面对“不可收拾”的局面。该报报导：最近一个时期。一般商品零售价格平均已上涨百分之六十，远超过外汇的提高。据合众社上月廿九日上海讯：在蒋政府于廿九日提高美汇公开市场价格为四万九千五百元之后，黑市美钞价格立即又由二十七日之六万一千元猛涨为六万三千元。同时蒋区各公用事业纷纷加价。据路透社上海一日报导，自三日起，铁路、船运、邮电及其他各种公用事业都已大大涨价或将涨价。其中火车价增加百分之百，水运票价已自一日起增加百分之四十五，运费增加百分之廿五至三十，邮电增加百分之二百；此外航空公司客货运价虽自外汇新办法实施后于八月底即已加价百分之一百五十，但由于汽油价格不断上涨，现又将再度提高运价。同时沪中各物价格暴涨，二十八日大米零售每担已达六十六万元，日用品涨风亦炽，菜油每担达一百二十万元，四十支蓝凤纱每价已突破二千七百万元之大关，人造丝每担已迫近五千万元；中外股票亦一致上涨，呈“满堂红”现象。
