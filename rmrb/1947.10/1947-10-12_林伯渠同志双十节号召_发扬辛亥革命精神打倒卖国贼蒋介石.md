Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 10th. On the eve of the 36th anniversary of the Double Tenth Day, our reporter paid a special visit to Comrade Lin Boqu, Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, at the front. This veteran member of the Tongmenghui, who personally overthrew the Qing Dynasty with Sun Yat-sen, is in better health than before the evacuation from Yan'an. Chairman Lin said in an excited tone: "It is particularly significant to commemorate the Double Tenth Day when our border region's military and civilians have achieved continuous victories in the self-defense war, and in coordination with the victories of other liberated areas, have entered a full-scale counter-offensive. Thirty-six years ago, the corrupt and decaying Qing Dynasty was externally selling out the country and internally being brutal and corrupt. The Chinese people, living in dire straits, could no longer endure its dark rule. Therefore, the Wuchang Uprising was launched, and the whole country responded, quickly ending the Qing Dynasty and the thousands of years of imperial autocracy in China. However, the Tongmenghui program advocated by Sun Yat-sen before the 1911 Revolution: 'Restore China' and 'Equalize Land Ownership,' the goal for which the Chinese people have sacrificed and struggled for nearly a century, has not only failed to be realized in the 1911 Revolution and during Sun Yat-sen's lifetime, but has not even been half realized after the Kuomintang's dictatorship." Chairman Lin said indignantly: "The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang group, nominally carrying Sun Yat-sen's banner, fundamentally betrayed Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit, inherited the mantle of the Qing Dynasty imperial system and the Northern Warlords Yuan Shikai and Duan Qirui. They are an unprecedented traitorous group, a bandit gang of semi-colonial dictators. They have consistently sold out China and concentrated land ownership. After the Chinese people shed blood and sacrificed to defeat the Japanese invaders in the eight-year War of Resistance, they seized the fruits of victory, and in the past two years, they have even been wagging their tails under the pants of American imperialism, engaging in the traitorous, dictatorial, and civil war schemes to maintain their dark and bloody rule." Chairman Lin affirmed: "Only with the emergence of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, has the Chinese people's revolutionary movement had correct leadership. The unfinished cause of the 1911 Revolution has been thoroughly realized in the areas led by the Chinese Communist Party. The patriotic self-defense war and the land reform movement of equal land distribution carried out in our border region and fraternal liberated areas are not the most thorough 'Restoration of China' and 'Equalization of Land Ownership'? Today, the degree of corruption and decay of the Chiang Dynasty has far exceeded that of the Qing Dynasty imperial family, and the people's awakening and the strength of their armed forces are far beyond what the 1911 Revolution could compare with. The people have laid a solid foundation for victory. With the expansion of the recovered areas and the development of the newly liberated areas, the great liberation of the Northwest people is not far off. The light of the Yellow River basin and beyond Shanhaiguan has illuminated the whole country. Therefore, to commemorate the Double Tenth Day, all cadres and people in our border region should fully carry forward the spirit of the 1911 Revolution, actively carry out the work of recovering the areas, thoroughly distribute land equally, organize and accumulate strength, strive to support the front, completely eliminate the Chiang-Hu bandit gang, liberate the Great Northwest, cooperate with the full-scale counter-offensive of the liberated areas, and strive for the early arrival of a new 1911 Revolution-like national revolutionary situation." When talking about the situation of the old Tongmenghui members, Chairman Lin said: "Many of the people from the Tongmenghui era who are still alive have long been attached to the Chiang family bandit gang, while those who truly maintain the revolutionary spirit of the Tongmenghui, such as Ms. He Xiangning and Mr. Liu Yazi, have either suffered the oppression and jealousy of the Chiang family bandit gang, or have been expelled from the party by the Chiang Party; and General Zhao Shoushan, for example, was forced to come to the border region after many twists and turns, to jointly shoulder the great cause of liberating the people of the Northwest. And those who are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and banner, such as Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Comrade Dong Biwu, and Comrade Wu Yuzhang, have long joined the Chinese Communist Party and thoroughly realized Sun Yat-sen's true revolutionary Three People's Principles. At this time when the general trend that the Communist Party will surely prosper and Chiang Kai-shek will surely perish has been clearly determined, all Tongmenghui members and Kuomintang members in the Chiang-controlled areas, who truly inherit Mr. Zhongshan's revolutionary cause, in order to save themselves and save the country, should, in the revolutionary spirit of Mr. Zhongshan who overthrew the Qing Dynasty, resolutely break away from the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, and unite with the people in the Chiang-controlled areas to rise up and demand peace, democracy, freedom, and food from Chiang Kai-shek, cooperate with the full-scale counter-offensive of the military and civilians in the liberated areas, and jointly overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, expel American imperialism, and strive for the complete realization of a New Democratic China."

### 林伯渠同志双十节号召　发扬辛亥革命精神打倒卖国贼蒋介石

　　林伯渠同志双十节号召
  　发扬辛亥革命精神打倒卖国贼蒋介石
    【新华社西北十日电】双十节三十六周年纪念前夕，本社记者特走访陕甘宁边区政府林伯渠主席于战地。这位亲身与孙中山共同推翻满清的同盟会老人，精神健旺胜于撤离延安之前。林主席以兴奋的语调称：“当我边区军民在自卫战争中获得连续胜利，又配合其他解放区胜利进入全面反攻的时候来纪念双十节，是特别有意义的。三十六年前腐败溃烂的满清皇朝，外则丧权卖国，内则残暴贪污，水深火热的中国人民，已再不能忍受其黑暗统治，所以武昌举义，全国响应，很快就结束了满清和中国数千年来的皇帝专制。但是孙中山在辛亥革命前所倡导的同盟会纲领：‘恢复中华’与‘平均地权’，这个中国人民近百年来前仆后继牺牲奋斗的目标，却不仅在辛亥、在孙中山的生前未能实现，而且到了国民党专政之后，也半点都未实现。”林主席愤慨的说：“名义上打着孙中山的招牌的蒋介石匪帮集团，他们根本背叛孙中山的革命精神，承受了满清帝制和北洋军阀袁世凯、段琪瑞们的衣钵，他们是空前未有的汉奸集团，是半殖民地独裁者的匪帮，他们一贯出卖中华，集中地权。八年抗战中国人民流血牺牲打败日寇之后，他们则攫取胜利果实，两年来更夹着尾巴依在美帝国主义的裤裆下，进行卖国独裁内战的勾当，维持其黑暗血腥的统治。”林主席肯定地说：“只有出现了中国共产党和毛主席，百年来中国人民的革命运动才有正确的领导，辛亥革命的未竟事业，也就在中国共产党所领导的区域得到彻底的实现，我们边区与兄弟解放区所进行的爱国自卫战争和平分土地的土地改革运动，不正是最彻底的‘恢复中华’与‘平均地权’吗？而今蒋记皇朝腐败溃烂的程度，已远远超过满清皇室，而人民的觉醒及其武装力量的强大，则远非辛亥革命所能比拟。人民已奠定了胜利基础。随着收复区的扩大和新解放区的发展，西北人民的大翻身已为期不远。黄河流域和山海关外的光明已普照全国。因此，纪念双十节，我全边区干部和人民，应充分发扬辛亥革命的精神，积极进行收复区工作，彻底平分土地，组织与积蓄力量，努力支援前线，彻底消灭蒋胡匪帮，解放大西北，配合各解放区全面反攻，争取新的辛亥之全国性革命形势的早日到来。”当谈及老同盟会会员的情况时，林主席说：“现在还活着的同盟会时代的人物，有许多早已依附于蒋家匪帮，而真正保持同盟会革命精神的，如何香凝、柳亚子先生等，有的遭受蒋家匪帮的压迫嫉视，有的已被蒋党开除党籍；又如赵寿山将军，则被迫辗转来到边区，共肩解放西北人民的大业。而服膺于毛泽东思想和旗帜下的如朱总司令、董必武同志、吴玉章同志等，则早已加入中国共产党，彻底实现孙中山的真正革命三民主义。当此共产党必兴、蒋介石必亡大势已经判明的时候，一切处在蒋管区的同盟会员、国民党员，凡是真正继承中山先生革命事业的，为了救己救国，应本中山先生推翻满清的革命精神，坚决脱离卖国贼蒋介石，与蒋管区人民一致奋起向蒋介石要和平、要民主、要自由、要饭吃，配合解放区军民的全面大反攻，共同打倒蒋介石匪帮，驱逐美帝国主义，为新民主主义中国的完全实现而奋斗。”
