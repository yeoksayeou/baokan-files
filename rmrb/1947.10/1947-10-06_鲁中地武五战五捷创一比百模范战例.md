Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 2nd: Local armed forces in the Jiang-occupied areas of Luzhong achieved five victories in five battles in just four days. They annihilated over 200 enemies at the cost of only two lightly wounded soldiers. On September 19th, a unit of the local armed forces took the initiative to attack the pseudo-security team of Cai Dagu in Xiguozhuang, Yidu, capturing over ten enemies and more than sixty members of the "Homecoming Corps." On the 22nd, the same unit ambushed Zhao Zhongnuo's pseudo-Linshuo security team at Tangjiahe on the border of Changle and Linshuo, killing or wounding more than thirty enemy soldiers including the squad leader. They captured Major Instructor Zhang Hengji, squad leaders, and more than twenty members of the "Homecoming Corps." On the same day, another unit ambushed the enemy invading from Mingshui at Langgou, Zhangqiu, killing, wounding, and capturing over thirty of them. At the same time, another unit counterattacked over 200 puppet troops invading from Laiwu at Majiamiao, Laiwu, killing, wounding, and capturing thirty-two of them. Another unit attacked the Dakunlun stronghold on the Zhangdian-Boshan road, capturing eight enemies. In total, in four days, they killed, wounded, and captured over 120 Jiang troops and security team members, as well as over 70 members of the "Homecoming Corps," and seized three machine guns.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 3rd: As a certain People's Liberation Army unit of the Luzhong Military Region launched a large-scale counter-offensive, it expanded its political offensive, striving to bring back over a thousand people who had been deceived and forced to flee by the Jiang troops, and disintegrate 500 Jiang-puppet "Homecoming Corps" members. Cadres from Yedian and Dachan districts in Mengyin formed armed propaganda teams and widely publicized the victory of the People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive in over sixty newly recovered villages. Within a few days, the majority of the two thousand or so people in the area who had been deceived and coerced by the enemy to flee with them returned home. Zhao ×, a "Homecoming Corps" member near Qingtuo Temple (north of Linyi), along with fifteen people arrested by the Jiang troops, jointly killed the Jiang-puppet squad leader, broke out of prison, and returned to surrender to the democratic government. Poor and landless peasants in Wozhuang, Tao Tuo District, Yi (South), "swept out the door" the feudal landlord families in the village who had participated in the "Homecoming Corps," and at the same time distributed land to the poor puppet families who had been forced and deceived to participate. The impact was such that within ten days, over 140 "Homecoming Corps" members in the vicinity returned and surrendered. Yi (Shui), Dongheyang, Shuangquan, and other counties also won over over 200 "Homecoming Corps" members. In the suburbs of Laiwu, on September 1st alone, seventy "Homecoming Corps" members and Jiang-puppets repented and surrendered to the democratic government.
