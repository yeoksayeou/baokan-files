　　Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S. Collude to Persecute Democratic Figures
  　CCP Spokesperson Sternly Reveals
    Mr. Du Bin-cheng of the China Democratic League Has Been Murdered by Chiang's Bandits
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th] The CCP spokesperson today pointed out to reporters the murder of Mr. Du Bin-cheng, a well-known educator in the Northwest, indicating that Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang wants to maintain its tottering rule by expanding the massacre of democratic figures. The spokesperson pointed out: Chiang Kai-shek shamelessly says that the democratic figures he massacres are communists. When Chiang Kai-shek's bandits shot Mr. Du Bin-cheng in Xi'an on the 7th, they announced that Du was the person in charge of the CCP's Guanzhong Prefectural Committee. In fact, Mr. Du was the Northwest head of the Democratic League, dedicated his life to the cause of democracy, and was respected by the people of the Northwest. He was not a member of the CCP. The spokesperson said that in order to suppress the workers' strike movement in Shanghai, and to arrest and massacre striking workers, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits fabricated so-called CCP documents, saying that the CCP wanted to sabotage Shanghai's power plants. In order to persecute the Democratic League, the bandits created rumors that the Democratic League had taken over the CCP's underground work. The bandits arrested many dissatisfied elements in Beiping, including some senior officials. Some officials of the US government and American intelligence agencies have in the past and are now acting as detectives for Chiang Kai-shek, pointing out to Chiang Kai-shek's bandits who are these democratic figures and dissatisfied people, so that Chiang Kai-shek can arrest and slaughter them. Many of those who are now being persecuted are people who, without taking precautions, have clearly expressed their positions to the bloody butcher Wedemeyer and certain American officials who pretended to sympathize with the Chinese democratic movement. The spokesperson said that Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang is now carrying out a large-scale and brutal persecution of the democratic movement in the Chiang-controlled areas, which shows that Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang has lost confidence in its ability to rule. Because the People's Liberation Army has entered the counter-offensive on all battlefields, including the Shandong battlefield, it has caused panic among the bandits, so they are eager to find excuses to kill, so that the people dare not resist Chiang Kai-shek. But the slaughter will only expand the anti-Chiang movement. When the dictator becomes more and more crazy and bloodthirsty, it is when he is closer and closer to death. Chinese and foreign history have proved this truth thousands of times.

　　蒋美勾结行凶迫害民主人士
  　中共发言人严正揭露
    民盟杜斌丞先生已遭蒋匪杀害
    【新华社陕北十二日电】中共发言人今日向记者指出西北著名教育家杜斌丞先生的被害，表示蒋介石匪帮欲以扩大对民主人士屠杀的方法，维持其摇摇欲倒的统治。发言人指出：蒋介石在屠杀民主人士时，无耻地说他们是共产党。蒋介石匪徒于七日在西安枪毙杜斌丞先生时，宣布杜是中共关中地委负责人。实则杜先生为民主同盟的西北负责人，一生为民主事业奋斗，为西北人民所敬仰，并非中共党员。发言人说，蒋介石匪徒在上海为了要镇压工人的罢工运动，并为了要逮捕与屠杀罢工工人，伪造了所谓中共文件，说中共要破坏上海的电厂。匪徒们为了要迫害民主同盟，造出谣言说什么民盟接收了中共的地下工作，匪徒们在北平逮捕了许多表示不满的分子，包括若干高级官员在内。美国政府若干官员和美国的特务机关过去和现在，都替蒋介石当侦探，指示给蒋介石匪徒，谁是这种民主人士和不满的人士，使蒋介石逮捕和屠杀他们。现在被迫害的人们中，不少是曾经没有防备的对血腥屠夫魏德迈之流以及某些假装同情中国民主运动的美国官员明白表示过他们的立场的人们。发言人说，蒋介石匪帮现在对蒋管区民主运动实行大规模的惨酷迫害，说明了蒋介石匪帮对自己的统治能力业已丧失信心，因为人民解放军在一切战场上，包括山东战场在内，都已进入反攻，引起了匪徒们的惊慌失措，所以急于找寻杀人的借口，使人民不敢反抗蒋介石。但是屠杀将只会使反蒋运动扩大，独裁者愈加疯狂好杀的时候，就是他愈加接近死亡的时候，中外历史已经千百次证实了这个真理。
