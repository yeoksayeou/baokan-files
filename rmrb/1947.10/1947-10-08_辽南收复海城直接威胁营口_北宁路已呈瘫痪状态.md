Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 6th: A unit of General Lin Biao's forces, composed of assault cavalry, advanced towards Haicheng from Liaonan on the 3rd. The Chiang bandits dared not resist and fled in panic. Our army recovered the city at 3 PM that afternoon. This is the eighth city recovered in the three days of our autumn offensive. Yingkou, another maritime transportation and supply port for the Chiang bandits in the Northeast, is now under serious threat from our army. Note: Haicheng is where General Pan Shuoduan's 184th Division gloriously revolted in May of last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 6th: While bandit chief Chen Cheng is anxiously running around like a cat on a hot tin roof, constantly issuing orders to "restore" the Beining Railway, this lifeline of the bandit army has become completely paralyzed. Currently, our army has thoroughly disrupted the land-based communication between inside and outside Shanhaiguan for the Chiang bandits, making it increasingly difficult for the US imperialists to transport military supplies to the Chiang bandits in the Northeast. From Juliuhe, northwest of Shenyang, to Shanhaiguan in the south, the People's Liberation Army has occupied nearly ten important strongholds and stations between Shanhaiguan and Suizhong, including Zhongqian Suo and Qianwei, between Xingcheng and Suizhong, including Baimiaozi, Shahousuo, Wanghaidian, and Dongxinzhuang, and south of Juliuhe and Xinmin, including Baiqibao, Raoyanghe, and Gaoshanzi. We have completely dismantled this supply and transportation line used by the Chiang bandits to attack the people. At the same time, the Chiang bandits, attempting to delay our pursuing army, also frantically blew up bridges and stations while fleeing. As a result, this narrow corridor of the Chiang bandits has completely lost its function. Armored trains of the Chiang bandits patrol at risk between some sections, frequently suffering derailments. The bandit army is either completely annihilated or captured, or flees in disarray during our sabotage operations, abandoning countless ammunition and supplies. The amount of salt alone reached 500,000 catties. Our army has already distributed all the captured salt to the local residents.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 6th: This agency's reporter Yang Geng reported on the panic-stricken state of the Chen Cheng bandit gang under the shock of the People's Liberation Army's rapid offensive: In the long battle line over the four days, one unit of our army completely routed the enemy's 2nd Cavalry Division at Jianshanzi (south of Changchun) in Fanjiatun, killing over fifty bandits, including bandit cavalry Major General Division Commander Jin Zansong and Regiment Commander Wang Qizhen, giving a great lesson to the bandits who willingly serve as the Chiang bandits' lackeys to attack the people. Bandit chief Chen Cheng at this time truly displayed his incompetence in command and the extremely ridiculous plight of being utterly frightened and demoralized. According to prisoners of war, when our army had already reached Shuangchengz, Chen Cheng was still ordering the Chiang bandit 52nd Army's 195th Division to flee from Bamiancheng to Shuangmiaozi. The next day, the enemy suddenly discovered that a unit of our main force was already pursuing them. That night, they abandoned ammunition and supplies and fled south in a hurry. When the enemy reached Yushubao, south of Kaiyuan, to rest, they were suddenly attacked by our army, and another part of them was annihilated and captured. The prisoner of war praised our army with great admiration, repeatedly saying: "The Democratic Allied Army is truly a divine army. Once you set up a dragnet, it's impossible for us to escape. And our (referring to the Chiang bandits') command is so useless. Chen Cheng doesn't even understand the situation and just boasts with his eyes closed. How can we not be defeated!"

　　辽南收复海城直接威胁营口
  　北宁路已呈瘫痪状态
    【新华社东北前线六日电】林彪将军所部大军一部三日自辽南突击骑兵，向海城挺进，蒋匪未敢应战，即仓惶逃遁，我军当于是日下午三时收复该城。此为我秋季攻势三日中收复之第八座城市。东北蒋匪之另一海上运输补给港口——营口又处我军严重威胁之下。按：海城为去年五月潘朔端将军所部一八四师光荣起义之地。
    【新华社东北前线六日电】当匪首陈诚急得象火烧屁股，不断下命令要“恢复”北宁路的时候，而此一匪军输血管，已是完全成了瘫痪状态了。目前我军已彻底破坏了蒋匪的关内外陆上联络，使美帝国主义援助东北蒋匪之军火物资运输日益困难。北起沈阳西北之巨流河，南至山海关，解放军已占领山海关至绥中间之中前所、前卫，兴城至绥中间之白庙子、沙后所、望海店、东辛庄、与巨流河、新民以南之白旗堡、绕阳河、高山子等重要据点、车站近一十处，并已彻底拆毁此一蒋匪进攻人民之补给运输线。同时，蒋匪企图阻延我追击大军，彼等逃窜时亦慌乱炸毁桥梁车站。因此蒋匪这一狭隘之走廊，已完全失去作用，若干部分间之蒋匪铁甲列车冒险巡逻，时遭颠覆。匪军每于我破击中，或全部被歼俘，或狼狈逃窜。遗弃弹药物资无数，仅食盐一项即达五十万斤。刻我军已将缴获之食盐，悉数分给当地居民。
    【新华社东北前线六日电】本社记者杨赓报导陈诚匪徒在民主联军神速攻势震慑下之狼狈慌乱情形称：四日中长线战事中，我军一部于范家屯之尖山子（长春之南），一举击溃敌骑兵第二师，毙匪骑兵少将师长金赞松、团长王其枕以下五十余人，给予甘心为蒋匪鹰犬进攻人民之匪辈一大教训。而匪首陈诚此时则实足表现其指挥无能及丧胆落魄极其可笑之窘态。据俘虏称：当我军已兵临双城子时，陈诚还在命令着蒋匪五十二军一九五师从八面城向双庙子逃命，翌日该敌突发现我大军一部已追蹑其后，当晚即遗弃弹药辎重向南急窜，而方抵昌图附近时，又遇见敌五十三军之溃兵正抱头鼠窜，知昌图已被我包围（已于三日收复），乃又绕道奔命。当该敌一九五师于黄昏窜至开原以南之榆树堡准备稍停喘息时，却被我军突至，又歼俘其一部。该俘虏以极其钦佩的口吻连连称赞我军：“民主联军真是神兵天降，你们一摆下天罗地网，真是叫我们飞也飞不掉，而我们（指蒋匪）的指挥部却是那末不中用，陈诚连情况都搞不清楚，只闭着眼睛吹牛皮，怎能不打败仗！”
