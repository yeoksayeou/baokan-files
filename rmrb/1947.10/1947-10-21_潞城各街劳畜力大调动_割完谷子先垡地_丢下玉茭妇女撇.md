　　Big Mobilization of Labor and Livestock in Various Streets of Lucheng
  　Plow the Land Immediately After Harvesting Millet
  　Women Set Aside Corn
    [Our Newspaper Lucheng News] When the autumn harvest and autumn plowing began in the city of District One, the masses in each street said, "We can only plow the land after the threshing ground is clear and the land is clean." There was also a shortage of labor and livestock, and the autumn harvest and autumn plowing would not be completed until the tenth day of the tenth lunar month. After discovering this idea, a meeting of cadres above the level of group leaders in the entire city was held. Yuan Gui proposed: "This year there has been a lot of autumn rain and the soil is wet. What will happen if the ground freezes after the harvest!" After cadres from each street precisely calculated all the land, labor, livestock, and weather, they realized that if they wanted to complete both the autumn harvest and autumn plowing without delay, they had to organize a large-scale mobilization of labor and livestock, which would allow them to complete the work twenty days earlier. In the entire city, excluding wheat fields, there were 5,320 mu of autumn land. The entire city had 64 yokes of livestock. If 60 yokes of livestock were used to plow the land every day, in addition to the four yokes of livestock serving the threshing ground, 240 mu of land could be plowed each day. It would still take more than 20 days to complete the autumn plowing. After calculation, the slogan "Men plow the land immediately after harvesting millet, women set aside the corn!" was proposed. The liberated hero Wang Erze proposed the slogan: "There is a lot of autumn rain and early freezing, so organize the autumn harvest and autumn plowing well. Plow the land immediately after harvesting the millet. Organize women to set aside the corn. Autumn plowing turns over the grass, making it easier to plant seedlings next spring." The West Street also proposed: "Laborers thresh and grind, livestock only plow millet land, women set aside corn, male laborers use small carts to transport the corn home. After the corn land is cleared, the millet land is also plowed, and the livestock can plow the corn land at any time. We will definitely complete the work ahead of schedule by the 20th of the ninth month." After this arrangement, ideological obstacles were broken, and everyone was very enthusiastic and immediately started working. (Jing Tang, Fu Ze)
    [Our Newspaper Pingshun News] In the Guangwu Sub-district of District Five, seven villages convened a sub-district meeting on October 9th to inspect the autumn harvest and promote autumn plowing. The sub-district originally planned to harvest 5,743 mu of millet and sow 1,674 mu of wheat as a catch crop in seven days. In leading the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, each village democratically established an Autumn Harvest and Autumn Plowing Committee to be responsible for leading the living arrangements. Work points were calculated using work tickets, and the labor and livestock were precisely calculated. There were a total of 273 head of livestock and 9,874 mu of autumn land. One yoke of livestock could plow three mu of land per day, which would not be completed in twenty days, and the ground would freeze. Immediately, the slogan of seizing the day to harvest autumn and seizing the day to plow the land was put forward, mobilizing men and women to work hard, starting early and working late. Women harvested, men carried, and livestock were used to sow wheat and plow the autumn land. After three days of inspecting the plan, more than 800 mu of wheat and 574 mu of millet were harvested. Women harvested half of the millet and also realized the distribution by mu and by work. The remaining male laborers and livestock sowed 7,812 mu of wheat. For example, in Hebei Village, every work was completed ahead of schedule. The slogan "One step ahead, every step ahead" was put forward. Labor heroes led the way in carrying more than 200 mu of millet at night, and the distribution was made according to the distance and the number of trips. For example, women cutting millet at night were distributed according to the amount of millet cut, which promoted the entire sub-district. (Zhang Jian)

　　潞城各街劳畜力大调动
  　割完谷子先垡地
  　丢下玉茭妇女撇
    【本报潞城讯】一区城内秋收秋耕开始时，各街群众都说：“场光地净才能垡地。”劳畜力又少，秋收秋耕到阴十月初十日才能完成。发现这个思想后，就召开全城小组长以上干部会议，元贵提出：“今年秋雨多，地根湿，收后地上了冻怎办！”经各街干部把全部土地，劳畜力，天气数，精确计算一下，秋收秋耕想两不耽误，必须组织劳畜力大调动，这样能提前二十天完成。全城除麦地外，还有秋地五千三百二十亩，全城畜力六十四犋，每天除牲口四犋服勤外，以六十犋牲口来垡地，每天能垡地二百四十亩，还得二十多天才能完成秋耕。经过计算后，提出口号：“男人割谷就垡地，丢下玉茭妇女撇！”翻身英雄王二则提出口号：“秋雨多，上冻早，秋收秋耕组织好，割了谷，就垡地，玉茭组织妇女撇，秋垡地，翻下草过年春天好捉苗。”西街又提出：“劳力打场推碾，牲口光垡谷地，妇女撇玉茭，男劳力用小车往家运，玉茭地撇完，谷地也垡完，牲口随时就能垡玉茭地，到九月二十日一定能提前完成。”经这样安排，打破了思想障碍，大家劲头很高，立即下手就做。（景堂、福则）
    【本报平顺讯】五区广武小区，七个村在十月九号召开了小区会议，检查秋收推动秋垡地。小区原订七天计划，割谷五千七百四十三亩，种赶茬麦一千六百七十四亩，在秋收秋耕领导上，各村民主成立了秋收秋耕委员会，负责领导生活安排。计工使用工票，把劳畜力做了精确计算，共畜力二百七十三头，共秋地九千八百七十四亩，一犋牲口一天犁三亩，二十天还犁不完，地就冻了，当即提出抢天收秋，抢天犁地的口号，发动男女总动员，起早搭黑，妇女割，男人背，抽出畜力种麦秋犁地。三天检查计划，赶麦八百余亩，割谷五百七十四亩，妇女割了半数，并实现了按亩按活折分，余出男劳力牲口种了麦七千八百一十二亩。如河北村每一工作是在前完成，提出“一步在前，步步在前”的口号，劳动英雄领导黑夜担谷二百多亩，按远近遭数折分，如妇女黑夜切谷，按谷个折了分，这样推动了全小区。（张健）
