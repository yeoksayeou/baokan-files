Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd -- Athens Dispatch: On the sixth anniversary of the founding of the Greek National Liberation Front, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front issued a letter to the Greek people, denouncing the conspiracy of American and British imperialism to support Greek reactionaries in order to enslave the Greek people. The letter declared: "In a short period of time, the National Liberation Front has developed into a powerful force, but the Greek people have not obtained the fruits of victory they deserve. The reactionary forces, with the armed intervention and support of Britain, established a bloody fascist rule in Greece, cruelly persecuting all progressive elements, first and foremost the fighters of the national resistance movement. But Britain could not suppress the people's movement and ceded its place to the United States. Now American imperialism is forcefully continuing its policy of enslaving the Greek people, trying to make the Greek people serve its interests. The Greek people are once again under foreign occupation. We are determined to continue to fight to the end for the independence and freedom of our motherland, no matter the cost. The National Liberation Front will continue this struggle together with the people of the whole country. At the same time, we are still willing to work together with the people of the whole country to end the civil war through an agreement sufficient to guarantee the independence and freedom of the motherland."

　　希腊民族解放阵线决为独立自由斗争
    【新华社陕北二日电】雅典讯：希腊民族解放阵线成立六周年，民解中委会发表告希腊人民书，痛斥美英帝国主义美者扶植希腊反动派以奴役希腊人民的阴谋。文中宣称：“民解在短暂的时期中，已发展成为一支强大的力量，然而希腊人民没有得到他们应有的胜利果实。反动势力借英国的武装干涉与支持，在希腊建立起血腥的法西斯统治，残酷地迫害一切进步分子，首先是迫害民族抵抗运动战士。但英国镇压不了人民运动，乃让位给美国，现美帝国主义正强力继续进行奴役希腊人民的政策，力图使希腊人民为其利益而服役。希腊人民再度处在外国占领之下。我们已决心不惜一切牺牲，继续为祖国的独立与自由而奋斗到底。民解将和全国人民一起，继续这个斗争。同时仍愿经由足以保证祖国独立与自由之协定，与全国人民同心协力终止内战。”
