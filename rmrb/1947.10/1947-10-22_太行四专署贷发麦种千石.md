[Reported by this newspaper from Taihang] In order to increase production, eliminate the wastelands created by stubborn pseudo-elements in the new district, and expand wheat fields, the Fourth District Office of Taihang has decided to implement measures to reward the elimination of wasteland and the planting of more wheat: 1. For fallow land that has been uncultivated for more than three years, if the original owner is unable to cultivate it, any collective or individual may carry out reclamation and enjoy three years of usage rights. During this period, no burdens or taxes will be levied. Whether it will be taken back after the period expires will be decided by both parties through negotiation. 2. Fallow land that has been uncultivated for less than three years should be cultivated by the original owner as much as possible through mutual aid. If the original owner is unable to cultivate it, it may be allowed to be reclaimed by others on a voluntary basis, and the reclaimer will enjoy two years of usage rights, with no burdens or taxes levied during these two years. 3. To address the difficulty of obtaining wheat seeds for turned-over households, in addition to mutual adjustment, the District Office will specially lend out 1,000 shi of wheat seeds, distributed to various counties to solve the seed shortage, to be returned after the wheat harvest next year. 4. The District Office will allocate a bonus of 1,000,000 yuan specifically to reward labor heroes and models.
