Xinhua News Agency, Yuxi Front, 11th: Our army has recaptured Song County. The city was initially liberated by us on September 5th, but was invaded by the enemy again on the 19th. On the night of the 5th of this month, one of our units attacked the city, and the defending enemy fled eastward in panic. Our army seized over 20,000 rounds of ammunition, 900 artillery shells, and over 200 bags of rice.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yuxi Front, 11th: Our guerrilla corps is active in the outskirts of Luoyang. On the 7th, they liberated Gushui Town, an important stronghold on the Longhai Railway 20 miles west of Luoyang, annihilating all the local reactionary forces guarding the town, and capturing over 200 prisoners. On the 5th, another unit launched a surprise attack on Yanqiu, a key Chiang Kai-shek stronghold on the Luo (yang)-Yi (yang) highway 40 miles southwest of Luoyang. All 30-odd enemy soldiers defending the area were captured alive, and the area was occupied. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Luoyang are now in a state of extreme panic due to these successive blows.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, 10th: The main results of the Chen-Su counter-offensive forces' capture of Juancheng on the 2nd: The complete annihilation of the 355th Regiment of the 119th Brigade of the Kuomintang 68th Division defending the city; the annihilation of a unit directly under the 119th Brigade and a supply company at Linpuji, southwest of the city; a total of over 1,600 prisoners including Wei Dianxiang, the deputy regimental commander of the 355th Regiment, and over 600 members of the "Homecoming Corps" captured alive; and over 300 enemy soldiers killed or wounded. Over ten artillery pieces, over one hundred light and heavy machine guns, and many other military supplies were seized. Note: The 119th Brigade was completely annihilated by General Liu Bocheng's troops in the Juancheng campaign last October and was subsequently rebuilt by conscripting new soldiers.

　　豫西再克嵩县
  　鄄城之捷歼蒋匪二千
    【新华社豫西前线十一日电】我军再克嵩县。该城于九月五日经我初次解放，十九日复为敌侵陷。本月五日夜，我某部进袭该城，守敌仓惶向东遁去。我军缴获子弹两万余发，炮弹九百发，大米二百余包。
    【新华社豫西前线十一日电】洛阳外围我游击兵团活跃。七日解放洛阳西二十里陇海路上重要据点谷水镇，歼灭守敌土顽全部，生俘二百余人。又五日另部奔袭洛阳西南四十里洛（阳）宜（阳）公路要冲蒋匪据点延秋，守敌三十余名尽被生俘，并将该地占领。洛阳蒋匪经此连续打击，现已恐慌万状。
    【新华社华中前线十日电】陈粟反攻大军二日攻克鄄城之役，主要战果：全歼守城蒋军整六十八师一一九旅三五五团，在城西南临濮集歼一一九旅直属队一部及其一个辎重连，共生俘三五五团副团长魏殿香以下一千六百余人，及“还乡团”六百余人，毙伤三百余人。缴获各种炮十余门，轻重机枪百余挺，其他军用品甚多。按：一一九旅曾为刘伯承将军所部于去年十月鄄城战役全部歼灭后又抓丁凑成。
