　　Turned-Over Teacher and Landlord Teacher
    Li Wenshan
    Zhang Minglin was a native-born worker-peasant intellectual who had a rudimentary knowledge of writing. After the liberation of Wu'an two years ago, he became a teacher in Fifteenth Street, Chengguan. During the land reform movement, his family was turned over, and he was very enthusiastic about his teaching.

    This year, after being trained in the county in the first lunar month, he felt that his cultural level was low and his teaching experience was lacking. At that time, he asked the higher authorities for a teacher with a higher cultural level to teach with him, because he thought that this would help him learn on the one hand, and on the other hand, it would not delay the children's learning progress. Later, the schools of Third Street and Fifteenth Street merged, and the higher authorities assigned Jia Jicai, a landlord teacher who originally taught in Third Street, to teach with Zhang Minglin.

    After the school started, Zhang Minglin was so busy teaching every day that he couldn't even eat. However, Jia Jicai consistently worked passively and perfunctorily regarding the children's learning. He lived in Chengguan, more than a mile away from the school, and he always left early and arrived late for his meals at home. Zhang Minglin did not understand his background at the time and sincerely advised him several times, but not only did he not change, but he also formed personal prejudices.

    In the spring, parents asked their children to engage in production, and students were scattered and did not come to school. Zhang Minglin summoned all the children and, in response to the parents' requests, explained to the children the new educational policy of "both production and learning are not neglected." According to the needs of the masses in Chengguan, he also set up a production plan for the students to carry a load of water every three days and carry coal and soil once a week. The children were very happy to hear this and arrived in full numbers the next day.

    Jia Jicai fundamentally opposed this unsophisticated Zhang Minglin. While the children were engaged in production, he cultivated landlord children such as Li Runzhen and Liu Yue'e from Third Street to become cadres, and suggested to Zhang Minglin that the children from Third Street had not had labor training and could not participate in labor. Furthermore, during this period, he arranged for the landlord children to challenge the turned-over children. The landlord children had studied for many years, while the turned-over children had not. As a result, the turned-over children lost and had to carry water for the landlord children's families. If the turned-over children could not recite, he would beat them with a board, causing the children to complain secretly but dare not say anything in person, and gradually they did not dare to come to school anymore.

    Zhang Minglin felt that his cultural level was low. Every time he compiled textbooks and folk rhymes, he would always ask him to take a look, correct the words, and smooth the sentences. However, Jia Jicai always said on the surface, "Good, good." But when he wrote it on the blackboard, facing many students and the masses, he would loudly point out that this was wrong and that was wrong, making Zhang Minglin feel very embarrassed. He opposed mass movements and land reform. He was always dissatisfied with the fact that his family was struggled against. He did not participate in mass movements and did not allow the children to participate. Zhang Minglin compiled a "Masses Turned-Over Song," but he said it was inappropriate and did not allow the children to sing it.

    Zhang Minglin endured various blows. He never bowed his head in the face of these difficulties, but instead worked more actively. Later, he personally went to the cooperative to establish a good relationship with the manager and brought back forty-eight spinning wheels to teach the girls to spin. Later, the girls' groups all learned to spin, which greatly helped their family life. During drought prevention and famine preparation, he also personally participated in the children's mutual aid group, carrying water and planting flowers, uniting all the turned-over masses and turned-over children around himself. The facts that Jia Jicai had opposed mass movements, evaded labor, wandered around, attacked turned-over children, and sabotaged everywhere were soon discovered by the masses one by one. In addition to mobilizing the masses and children to speak out their grievances and struggle against him, he was also detained. Zhang Minglin's spirit of hard work and fearlessness of difficulties finally succeeded. During the county training, everyone elected him as a special model for the entire county.

　　翻身教员和地主教员
    李文珊
    张鸣林是个土生土长粗通文字的工农知识分子，前年武安解放后，他就到城关十五街当教员，在土地改革运动中，他家庭翻了身，他教学干的很有劲。
    今年正月他在县里集训后，感到自己文化低，教学经验少，当时向上级要求一个文化比他高的教员和他一同教学，他想这样一方面好帮助他学习，另一方面不耽误儿童们的学习进步。后来三街和十五街的学校合并，上级就让一个原在三街教学的地主教员贾积财和张鸣林一同教学。
    开学以后，张鸣林每天上课忙得顾不上吃饭。但贾积财却一贯的是消极怠工，对儿童的学习是应付公事。他家就在城关住，离学校一里多地，每天回去吃饭都是早退晚到。张鸣林当时不了解他的成份，几次好意的劝他，不但没改，反而结成私人成见。
    春天家长要求儿童生产，学生七零八落的不到学校。张鸣林召集全体儿童，针对着家长们的要求，给儿童们说明了现在“生产学习两不误”的教育新方针。根据城关群众的需要，又给学生们订下了三天抬一担水，一星期抬一次煤土的生产计划。儿童们听了很高兴，第二天到的齐齐的。
    贾积财根本就反对这个土头土脑的张鸣林，趁儿童们进行生产的时候，他把三街的地主儿童李润珍、刘月娥等培养起来当干部，给张鸣林提出三街儿童没有劳动锻炼，不能参加劳动。并且在这个期间，给地主儿童布置了向翻身子弟挑战。地主子弟念书多年，翻身子弟没念过书，结果翻身子弟输了还得给地主儿童家里抬水。翻身子弟念不会，他就用板子打，制的儿童们背地光叫苦，当面不敢吭，慢慢的都不敢来学校了。
    张鸣林感到自己文化程度低，每次编好了教材快板歌子时，总要先叫他看看，改改字，顺顺句，但贾积财总是表面上说：“不错、不错”，及至写到黑板上，对着很多学生和群众，他才大声指出这个错了，那个不对，闹的张鸣林脸上很难看。他反对群运，反对土地改革。他家里挨了斗，他心里总是不服气。他不参加群运，也不让儿童们参加。张鸣林编了个“群众翻身歌”，他说不合适，不叫童儿们唱。
    张鸣林忍受了各种打击。在这种困难下从没有低过头，反而干的更加积极了。后来他又亲自到合作社，给经理搞好关系，搬来四十八辆纺花车，教女生们学纺花。后来女生们小组都学会了纺花，对家庭生活上也有了很大帮助。防旱备荒时又亲自参加儿童互助小组，担水种花，把所有的翻身群众，翻身子弟都团结在自己的周围。贾积财所做的反对群运，逃避劳动，东游西串，打击翻身子弟，到处破坏的事实不久也一件一件被群众所发现，除发动群众和儿童诉苦斗争外，又把他扣起来。张鸣林这样艰苦实干，不怕困难的精神终于得到了成功，县里集训时大家选他为全县特等模范了。
