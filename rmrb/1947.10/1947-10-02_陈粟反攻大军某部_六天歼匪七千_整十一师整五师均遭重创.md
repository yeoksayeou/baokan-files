Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 30th: A unit of the Chen Su counter-offensive army fiercely attacked various Chiang Kai-shek troops reinforcing in southwestern Shandong, annihilating over 7,000 enemies in six days from September 20th to 25th. This included intercepting three brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's Reorganized 11th Division in the Tushanji, Dayiji, and Huoshentai areas south of Cao County, killing or wounding over 4,000 of them. Intercepting two brigades of the Reorganized 75th Division in the Shanglong＠ji area of Juye, killing or wounding over 1,000 of them. And fiercely attacking the Reorganized New 5th Division (formerly the 5th Army) in the Zhangfengji area east of Chengwu, killing or wounding over 2,000 of them. The main forces of Chiang Kai-shek's troops that had infiltrated into southwestern Shandong, after suffering repeated and heavy blows, have seen their elite forces greatly weakened, their combat effectiveness diminished, and desertions increasing daily. Currently, each company averages only eighty or ninety men, and morale is particularly low. Military observers comment that the People's Liberation Army's strategy is to inflict annihilation blows on the elite main forces of Chiang Kai-shek's troops (the New 5th Division and the 11th Division are two of Chiang Kai-shek's five main forces), creating a foundation for completely annihilating Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the future, just as the elite main force of Chiang Kai-shek's 74th Division was repeatedly weakened in the past, and finally completely annihilated at Menglianggu.

　　陈粟反攻大军某部
  　六天歼匪七千
  　整十一师整五师均遭重创
    【新华社华东前线三十日电】陈粟反攻大军一部于鲁西南痛击各路增援蒋军，于九月二十至二十五日六天中，共歼敌七千余。计在曹县南土山集、大义集、火神台地区截击蒋军整编十一师三个旅，毙伤其四千余。在巨野商龙＠集地区截击整编七十五师两个旅，毙伤其千余。在城武东张凤集地区痛击整编新五师（前第五军）毙伤其两千余，窜入鲁西南之蒋军主力，经历次惨重打击后，精锐大损，战力下降，逃亡日众，现每连平均仅八、九十人，而士气尤为沮丧。据军事观察家评称：解放军战略即在予蒋军精锐主力（按新五师，十一师为蒋军五大主力之二）以歼灭性打击，造成今后尽歼蒋军之基础，正如过去屡次削弱蒋军精锐主力七十四师而最后全歼该师于孟良崮的范例一样。
