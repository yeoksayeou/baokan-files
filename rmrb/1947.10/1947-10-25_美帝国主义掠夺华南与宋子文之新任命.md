Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. Moscow Broadcasting commentator Ma Xinu published an article on the 13th, commenting on "American Imperialism's Plunder of South China and Song Ziwen's New Appointment." The article is as follows:

According to Chinese newspapers, the newly appointed Chairman of Guangdong Province, Song Ziwen, consulted with American advisor Yang Ge, who arrived in Guangdong, before formally taking office. This news did not arouse surprise in Chinese public opinion, because everyone knows that Song Ziwen's new appointment is related to a new transaction between the Kuomintang (Chiang Kai-shek bandit group) and American monopoly capital regarding making South China the main base for American political, economic, and military control.

This kind of transaction is not the first time. Kuomintang financial groups, landlords, and warlords often sell out their country in exchange for the support of foreign capital to devastate the Chinese people and steal their wealth. Foreign capital also often provides them with political and economic assistance in order to plunder the wealth and sovereignty of all Chinese people. During the war against Japan, especially after the war, American bankers secured their monopoly position in the Kuomintang-controlled areas; during the same period, the four major families of China also became monopolists in various economic sectors within their controlled areas. Such as banking, import and export trade, industry and agriculture...etc., are all concentrated in the hands of the four major families. Of course, this further consolidated their connection with American capitalists, and also strengthened the Kuomintang's dependence on American capitalists. This has created the current situation of using foreign forces to support the Kuomintang monopoly capital that is extremely hated by the people.

As early as the war against Japan, the Kuomintang and American monopoly capitalists stipulated a large transaction, that is, American financial groups guaranteed the Kuomintang's preparations for and conduct of a civil war against democratic forces after Japan's surrender. The Chinese financial groups guaranteed to help American capital establish great power in China. The local task was to open the door to American goods and capital, grant American companies freedom of action, grant them the same rights as Chinese companies, and allow American monopoly enterprises to participate in the Kuomintang's monopoly organizations. In short, it has been accomplished to provide greater guarantees to American financial capital in plundering the Chinese people than before.

When Japan surrendered, the four major families seized Japanese enterprises and materials worth 400 billion US dollars as their own. And established eight huge so-called state-owned enterprises. Namely, China Textile Construction Corporation (capital of 100 billion US dollars, owning half of the country's spindles). China Textile Machinery Company, China Silk Company, China Petroleum Company, China Central Shipbuilding Company, China Aquatic Products Company, and Central Electrical Equipment Company; in addition, Song Ziwen's sugar company was established in Taiwan, Northeast China, and North China, owning 42 factories. According to the materials cited by the famous Chinese political commentator Chen Boda in his book "The Four Big Families of China," 80 percent of the capital of these enterprises is nominally owned by the state, but in reality belongs to the four big families and American capitalists who participate in the shares. Later, various new comprador combinations were established, and contracts were signed with American companies to allow them to purchase Chinese raw materials at low prices and plunder Chinese farmers. For example, Yangzi Company, headed by Kong Lingkan, son of Kong Xiangxi, signed contracts with 16 American companies; China Import and Export Company (i.e. Fuzhong Company), headed by Song Ziliang, brother of Song Ziwen, signed contracts with 11 American companies; Taiping Xingye Company, headed by Chen Guofu, one of the leaders of the Chinese "CC" group, signed contracts with 23 American companies. In addition, openly Sino-American joint ventures have been established. Such as Sino-American Industrial Company (capital of 100 billion US dollars), jointly established by American Chennault and Song Meiling, and Sino-American Shipping Company. Therefore, just one year after Japan's surrender, American companies had become the masters of the Chinese market. For example, 115 American firms in Shanghai manipulated the market; 75 companies manipulated 90 percent of the goods exported to China and the goods imported by the United States from China. They sold cheap goods on the Chinese market and obtained high profits. For example, a ton of newspaper is worth 130 US dollars in the United States, but it sells for 700 US dollars in China.

However, this large difference in profit did not satisfy the ambitions of American monopoly capitalists, but only increased their greed. With the expansion of the civil war and the incompetence of the Kuomintang rule, their dependence on American support and assistance increased. American bankers used this to bargain with the Kuomintang. Just as the Kuomintang sold China to the United States in order to obtain this assistance.

What dissatisfied American capitalists was that parasitic banks (i.e., central banks and other so-called "national banks") were not completely transferred to the United States. This parasitic bank is the general organ by which the Kuomintang preserves its comprador banks and sucks the blood of the Chinese people. Therefore, Wedemeyer proposed this time to hand over these organs that plunder the Chinese people directly to the hands of American monopoly capital combinations and their representatives. And install American advisors and chiefs, so that most of the looted property will no longer fall into the hands of the Kuomintang, but into the pockets of American capitalists, as one of the conditions for assisting the Kuomintang. They want to openly and secretly jointly run Sino-American enterprises, so that they will gradually become completely subordinate to the United States, and Chinese bankers will only play a subservient role. Such as requiring all enterprises and sovereignty in South China to be handed over to American bankers and industrialists. This is the new condition put forward by the United States.

The Kuomintang has implemented all of this one by one. In the Kuomintang's four major family camps and the central bank, American advisors have a prominent status, and representatives of American bankers have controlled the Kuomintang's construction rights (referring to the development of economic resources in the Kuomintang-controlled areas). Industrial and commercial entrepreneurs have also established branches of large American companies and signed agreements to control all resources and investments above and below ground in South China. The Americans know that not only in North China, but also in Central China, the end of the rule of American and Kuomintang capitalists is coming, so they are eager to invade and completely control South China, trying to gain a foothold in South China. Therefore, they demanded that Song Ziwen, one of the four major families and who has had close relations with the United States for a long time, be the chairman of Guangdong Province instead of other small warlords. That's why Yang Ge, Song Ziwen's backstage boss, went to Guangdong to help him.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. Chiang Kai-shek's corrupt king Song Ziwen, after taking office as Chairman of Guangdong Province, has launched a fierce squeeze on the forces of the former Chairman Luo Zhuoying's faction in the Guangdong economic system in the name of the "anti-corruption movement." According to a report from United Press Hong Kong on the 19th, quoting Guangdong news: Song Ziwen has ordered an "investigation" of the activities of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Shunde (transliteration) Sugar Factory affiliated to the "Guangdong Enterprise Company," which are still controlled by Luo's personnel. Luo Zhuocai (transliteration), the general manager of the sugar factory, has been arrested in the name of "misappropriation of public funds," and Liu Yulun (transliteration), the director of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, will also be replaced. The news revealed that Song Ziwen will use the "Guangdong Enterprise Company" as the main tool to complete his "South China Construction" (ie American colonization). The company has a capital of 100 billion yuan. In addition to textile, brewing, flour and rice mills, it also operates sugar cane, ice making and alcohol factories, and has wholesale and retail outlets in Guangzhou.

### 美帝国主义掠夺华南与宋子文之新任命

　　美帝国主义掠夺华南与宋子文之新任命
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】莫斯科广播评论员马西努十三日发表论文，评述“美帝国主义掠夺华南与宋子文之新任命”。文如下：
    据中国报纸载称：新任广东省主席宋子文在正式视事以前，曾与抵达广东的美国顾问杨格会商。此消息并未引起中国舆论的奇怪，这是因为大家都知道宋子文的新委任，是和国民党（蒋匪集团）与美国独占资本之间关于使华南变成为美国在政治、经济、军事上统治的主要基地的新交易有联系的。
    这种交易已非第一次，国民党财阀、地主和军阀，经常出卖自己的国家，以换取外国资本的支持，来摧残中国人民和盗窃其财富。外国资本也经常给予他们政治、经济上的援助，以便换取剥夺全中国人民的财富及主权。在对日战争时期，特别是战后，美国银行家在国民党统治区域内，保证了自己的独占地位；同一时期，中国四大家族在其统治区内，也成了经济各部门的独占者。如银行业、出入口贸易、工农业……等，都集中在四大家族手中。当然这更加巩固了他和美国资本家的联系，同时也加强了国民党对美国资本家的依赖。而造成了目前用外力来支持被人民极端憎恨的国民党独占资本。
    还在对日作战时期，国民党与美国独占资本家，就曾规定了一项大宗买卖，即美国财阀们替国民党保证了在日本投降后，准备和进行反对民主力量的内战。中国的财阀则保证帮助美国资本在中国建立大权。局部的任务为对美国商品和资本打开大门，给予美国公司以行动自由，给与和中国公司同样的权利，让美国独占企业参加国民党的独占组织。总而言之，使美国财政资本在掠夺中国人民上得到较前更大的保证这一点是已经完成了。
    当日本投降时，四大家族将价值四十万万美元的日本企业和物资霸为己有。而建立了八个巨大的所谓国营企业。即中国纺织建设公司（资本十万万美元，拥有全国纱锭的半数）。中国纺织机械公司、中国蚕丝公司、中国石油公司、中国中央造船公司、中国水产、司及中央电工器材公司；另在台湾、东北、华北建立了宋子文的糖业公司，拥有工厂四十二处。据中国著名政论家陈伯达在其“中国四大家族”一书中所引证的材料，这些企业资本的百分之八十在名义上是属于国家的，而实际上属于四大家族、及参与股本的美国资本家。以后又建立了各种新的买办组合，并与美国公司之间签订合同，以便让他们以低价购买中国的原料、掠夺中国农民。如孔祥熙儿子孔令侃为首的扬子公司，与十六家美国公司签订了合同；宋子文之弟宋子良的中国出入口公司（按即孚中公司），与十一家美国公司签订了合同；中国“ＣＣ”领袖之一陈果夫为首的太平兴业公司，与二十三家美国公司签订了合同。此外又已建立了公开的中美合办企业。如美国陈纳德与宋美龄合股建立的中美实业公司（资本为十万万美元），及中美航业公司。因此在日本投降后刚刚过了一年，美国大公司便已成了中国市场上的主人。如在上海有一一五家美国商号操纵了市场；七十五家公司操纵了对中国的出口货及美国由中国的入口货百分之九十。以廉价的商品在中国市场上出售，而获得了高额利润。如一吨报纸在美价值一百三十美元，而在中国卖七百美元。
    可是这种大量差额利润，并未满足美国独占资本家的野心，而只是增加了他们的贪欲。随着内战的扩大与国民党统治的无能，更增加了他们对美国支持与援助的依赖性。美国银行家就利用这一点来向国民党讨价。正如国民党为取得这种援助而出卖了中国向美国讨价一样。
    使美国资本家不满意的是寄生性的银行（按即中央银行等所谓“国家银行”）未完全转让给美国。而这种寄生性的银行是国民党借以保存其买办银行及向中国人民吸血的总机关。因此魏德迈此次便提出将这些掠夺中国人民的机关直接交给美国独占资本组合及其代表之手。并安置上美国的顾问与长官，以使掠夺来的绝大多数财产不再落到国民党手中，而进入美国资本家的钱袋里，作为援助国民党的条件之一。他们想公开和秘密的合办中美企业，以逐渐使其完全从属于美国，而中国银行家只担任服从的角色。如要求华南一切企业与主权都交给美国银行家及工业家。这便是美国提出的新条件。
    国民党对这一切都一一执行了。在中国四大家族营垒中及中央银行中，美国顾问已有显著的身份，美国银行家的代表们已控制了国民党的建设权（按指开发国民党统治区的经济资源）。工商企业家也建立了美国大公司的分公司，并签订了控制华南地上地下所有一切资源及投资的协定。美国人知道不仅在华北，而且在华中美国与国民党资本家的统治末路就要到来了，遂急于侵略并完全控制华南，企图在华南站稳脚步。因此他们要求四大家族之一并与美国早就有密切关系的宋子文为广东省主席以代替其他小军阀。正为此，宋子文的后台主人杨格才去广东帮助他。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】蒋匪贪污大王宋子文出任广东省主席后，已在“反腐化运动”名义下，对前任主席罗卓英一派在广东经济系统中的势力展开激烈排挤。据合众社香港十九日电引广东消息：宋子文已下令“调查”仍被罗派人员控制之省政府农林局及“广东企业公司”所属顺德（译音）糖厂之活动。该糖厂总经理罗卓才（译音）已在“滥用公款”名义下而被捕，农林局长刘毓伦（译音）也将被撤换。该消息透露宋子文将利用“广东企业公司”作为完成其“华南建设”（即美国殖民地化）的主要工具。该公司拥有资金千亿元，除纺织、酿酒、面粉及碾米工厂外，尚经营蔗糖、制冰及酒精等工厂，并在广州市区有批发与零售处。
