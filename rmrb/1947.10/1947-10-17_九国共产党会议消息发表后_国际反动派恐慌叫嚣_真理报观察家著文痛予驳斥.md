Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. Moscow Dispatch: A Pravda observer wrote on the 12th: The news of the Nine-Party Communist Conference has been universally cheered by the democratic masses of the world. But it has aroused the rage of reactionaries and right-wing socialists. In the United States and Britain, in France and Turkey, in Australia and Franco's Spain, the consistent theme of bourgeois newspaper commentaries is provocative and panicky clamoring about the so-called "Communist threat." The warmongers are seeking a final excuse to undermine the United Nations. Churchill is urging the destruction of the United Nations, and the New York Times is advocating a separate peace treaty with Germany. The enemies of international cooperation and peaceful democracy are chanting clichés, desperately trying to shift the responsibility for dividing the world onto the Communists, but the responsibility for the division lies precisely with the expansionist actions of the American reactionaries and their endless desires for new conquests and new wars.

　　九国共产党会议消息发表后
  　国际反动派恐慌叫嚣
    真理报观察家著文痛予驳斥
    【新华社陕北十五日电】莫斯科讯：真理报观察家十二日写道：九国共产党代表会议的消息，得到全世界民主大众的普遍欢呼。但却引起了反动派与右派社会党人的狂怒。在美、英，在法、土，在澳洲与佛朗哥西班牙，资产阶级报纸评论的一致基调，都是所谓“共产党威胁”之类的挑拨而又恐慌的叫嚣。战争贩子们则觅取最后破坏联合国的口实。邱吉尔催促毁坏联合国，纽约时报主张单独与德签订和约。国际合作与和平民主的敌人，都唱着陈腔滥调，竭力想把分裂世界的责任转嫁共产党身上，但分裂的责任却正是由于美国反动分子的扩张行动，由于他们无穷的新征服新战争欲望所引起的。
