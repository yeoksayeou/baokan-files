Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 19th: The large army under General Lin Biao, within fourteen hours from the afternoon of the 17th to the morning of the 18th, successively captured Jiutai (i.e., Xia Jiutai, northeast of Changchun) and Nongan in a salient area north of Changchun. On the Jilin front, it also captured important strongholds such as Kouqian (south of Jilin), Jiuzhan (west of Jilin), and Wulajie (north of Jilin). The battle to capture Jiutai on the afternoon of the 17th ended in only two hours, with part of the defending enemy annihilated and captured by our forces. Another unit of our army launched a general offensive on Nongan at 4:00 AM on the 18th and captured the city at 8:30 AM, with most of the defending enemy annihilated. The results of the battle are still being investigated. Jiutai and Nongan are the 12th and 13th cities recovered in our autumn offensive. After the recovery of these two cities, only the isolated stronghold of Dehui remains on the periphery of Changchun. On the Jilin front, after our army captured Qipan Street and Huapi Factory, it captured the important Kouqian station south of Jilin on the 18th, capturing more than 600 enemy soldiers below the rank of battalion commander. On the same day, it captured Wulajie and Jiuzhan Station. In the battle of Wulajie, more than 1,000 enemies were annihilated, and the prisoners included Chiang's army Major General Chief Commander Xiang Chengxin and Deputy Chief Commander (name to be verified). In the battles of Jiuzhan and Huapi Factory, our army annihilated three battalions of the bandit's Provisional 52nd Division. Preliminary statistics show that more than ten bandits were killed or wounded, 546 enemy soldiers below the rank of battalion commander were captured, and a large number of supplies were seized. Our army is continuing to expand its gains.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th: After the two arteries of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's Northeast civil war nest, Shenyang – the Beining Road and the southern section of the China Changchun Railway – were cut off by the People's Liberation Army, the Chiang bandits in the city were extremely panicked. Chen Cheng ordered his henchmen to prepare for a "fight to the death" and strictly ordered "household registration checks." A large number of starving and freezing citizens were forced to go to the suburbs to dig fortifications. The whole city was under "suppression of rebellion martial law" from 9:00 PM to 5:00 AM every night. Sentries stood guard on the streets, and shouts continued all night. The wives of Chiang's bandit officials, big and small, were vying to buy "black market" plane tickets in order to escape to Peiping, Nanjing, and other places as soon as possible. Prices were soaring day by day. Sorghum rice had risen from 400 yuan (circulating currency, same below) per catty to 800 yuan, and firewood had risen from 20 yuan per catty to more than 60 yuan. In order to suppress the "wavering morale" in the city, the bandit leader Chen Cheng announced ten "execution orders," such as "rumor-mongers will be shot" and "those who disobey sentry commands will be shot," which made the whole city even more panicked. Another piece of information: soldiers of the New First Army who escaped from Changchun said that the Chiang army in Changchun is now playing an "empty city strategy." Since the New 38th and 50th Divisions of the New First Army were transferred south to Siping for reinforcements, the Chiang bandit city defenses in Changchun have become increasingly empty. The Chiang bandit infantry and artillery are blindly firing artillery towards Mengjiatun, which is more than ten miles south of the city and occupied by our forces, to embolden themselves. The Chiang bandit army in the city is implementing martial law and "household registration checks" all night. On the 5th, as many as 1,000 innocent people were arrested.

    【新华社东北十九日电】蒋家匪帮东北内战巢穴沈阳两条动脉——北宁路及中长路南段，被解放军斩断以后，市内蒋匪极为慌张。陈诚下令喽罗们准备“决死”，并严令“检查户口”，大批饥寒交迫的市民被迫驱往郊外赶挖工事，全市每晚自九时起至晨五时实行“戡乱戒严”。街上步哨林立，吆喝声终夜不断。蒋匪官员的大小太太们，为求早日逃往北平、南京等地，均纷纷争买“黑市”飞机票。物价一日千里，高粱米已由每斤四百元（流通券，下同）涨至八百元，柴每斤已由二十元涨至六十元以上。匪首陈诚为镇压市内“人心浮动”，公布了“造谣者枪决”、“不听岗哨指挥者枪决”等十条“枪决令”，使全市更为恐慌。另息：由长春逃出之新一军士兵称：长春蒋军现正扮演“空城计”，自新一军之新三十八师及五十师南调四平增援后，长春蒋匪城防益形空虚，蒋匪步炮兵向城南十余里为我占领之孟家屯方向胡乱开炮壮胆。市内蒋匪军澈夜实行戒严及“检查户口”，五日被逮捕无辜群众即达千人。
