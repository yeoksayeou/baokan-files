　　Solving the Difficulty of Poor Peasants' Livestock
  　Qi Haizhong's Poor Peasants Change Work to Plant Wheat
    [Report from this newspaper, Jilu Yu, 20th] The problem of poor peasants not thoroughly turning over, and the many difficulties in planting wheat, has been resolved in the Third District of Guancheng. Comprehensive materials from various places show that in the wheat planting campaign, poor peasants have difficulties such as distant land, lack of labor, lack of animal power, lack of farming tools, and lack of seeds, etc. This shows that in the past land reform review in our district, the basic masses have not been thoroughly liberated. Some people who were allocated land found it a burden. For example, Wang Wenxing's mother in Meizhongji, Fifth District of Nanfeng, was allocated four mu of distant land (four li away from home) during the land reform. Because of the lack of labor, almost all of it was left uncultivated in the autumn. Now there is not enough food, and she only eats one or two meals a day. She has not eaten salt for a long time. She has nothing like animal power or seeds. She lets her children sell cigarettes and peanuts to earn some money to buy wheat seeds. She is willing to give away the four mu of land she was allocated for two dou of wheat. The district is now trying to solve this problem. Tian Jinbao, a poor peasant in Dongmeizhong Village, was allocated five mu of land during the land reform. Because it was far from home and there was no labor, it was left uncultivated in the spring, and wheat has not yet been planted. Liang Xiguang, a 60-year-old man in the village, uses a small cart to push manure to the fields because he has no livestock. He said: "It was difficult before I had land. I didn't expect it to still be difficult without livestock after I was allocated land! I'm so old, I'm out of breath pushing the cart!" In order to solve the problem of poor peasants not being able to plant wheat due to lack of livestock, Qi Haizhong Village in the Third District of Guancheng, after discussion at a mass meeting, middle peasants voluntarily helped poor peasants to plant wheat, and the difficulty of poor peasants without livestock was solved. The middle peasants said: "Middle and poor peasants are one family, and middle peasants must help them when they have difficulties." Some asked the village cadres: "See who has not planted how much? What are the difficulties? Tell us." The poor peasants then raised the difficulties of planting wheat. Some said that three mu had not been planted, and some said that they had one and a half mu that had not been planted. There were a total of fourteen households with difficulties in planting wheat, and there were eighteen head of livestock in the village, who voluntarily planted wheat for the households with difficulties. In the voluntary assignment, both parties expressed their attitudes. Those with cattle said: "I will plant a little later, but I have to plant for the poor peasants." Poor peasants without cattle said: "If you have any urgent work, go and work with them." A woman who had neither cattle nor people said: "I have no man, if anyone has needlework that is not finished, just tell me." In such mutual assistance, fourteen poor peasant households planted wheat. In addition, our local governments have provided loans, and the masses have carried out mutual assistance to solve the difficulties of poor peasants in planting wheat.
    [Report from this newspaper, Jilu Yu, 21st] The poor peasants in Dongwangzhuang, Fan County, and Wanglaofan Village, Kaocheng, have organized mutual aid teams and have completed their wheat planting plans. Under the leadership of the poor peasant cadres, Dongwangzhuang completed the wheat planting plan on the first day of the ninth lunar month. Except for those who are often engaged in business, 45 households in the village have organized four mutual aid teams. Under the slogan of "Everyone works together to plant more wheat and harvest more grain," the masses are very enthusiastic. The second group was the earliest, and it was completed on the 27th day of the eighth lunar month. The four groups have a total of 850 mu of land. Except for soybeans, sweet potatoes, and hawthorns, all the land has been planted with wheat, with a total of 670 mu, or more than 83 percent. Now the wheat seedlings one inch high have grown all over the fields. Wanglaofan Village, Fifth District of Kaocheng, has seven extremely poor households. Originally, they had no ridge land. The village head, Xie Wanzhu, used to make a living by drying salt. Xie Wanbao is blind and makes a living by selling playing cards. Sun San and Wang Er both sell manure and beg for food. In the land reform, they actively participated in the struggle and were allocated 80 mu of land and a small donkey. As soon as these poor people got land reform, they had a particularly strong enthusiasm for production. They cooperated with the small donkey to pull the plow very early, plowing five mu every day, for a total of more than 60 mu of land. Before the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, other places had not yet finished plowing the land, but they planted wheat early.
    [Report from this newspaper, Lincheng] Wangjiazhuang responded to the call of the county party committee, thoroughly inspected the difficulties of poor peasants and hired laborers in planting wheat, and found that there were seven poor peasants and hired laborers with little wheat land. For example, the Wang Shanlai family has six people and only planted five mu of wheat. After discussion by the cadres, a total of 34 mu of school land and undivided fruit land were taken out and appropriately distributed to the seven poor peasants and hired laborers with little wheat land, which solved their difficulties.

　　解决贫农牲口困难
  　齐海中贫农变工种麦
    【本报冀鲁豫廿日电】贫农翻身不彻底，种麦中的许多困难，在观城三区已获得解决。综合各地材料，在种麦运动中，发现贫农存在着地远、没劳力、没畜力、没耕具、没种子等等困难，说明我区在过去的土改复查中，基本群众还没得到彻底翻身，有的分了地，倒成了包袱。如南峰五区妹冢集王文兴他娘，土改中分了四亩远地（离家足有四里），因无劳力，秋季几乎全荒了，现在粮食不够吃，每天只吃一顿或两顿饭，很长时间没有吃盐，畜力、种子等，什么都没有，让小孩卖烟卷、花生，赚点钱籴麦种，分的那四亩地，情愿带二斗麦子让出去。现在区里正设法解决。东妹冢村贫农田进宝，土改时分了五亩地，因离家远，没劳力，春天即荒了，现在麦子还没种上。该村梁锡广六十多岁了，因没牲口，自己用小车往地里推粪，他说：“没有地以前是个难，想不到分了地没有牲口还是难！我这大年纪了，推起小车来，光发喘！”为了解决贫农没牲口不能种麦的困难，观城三区齐海村在群众大会上经过讨论，中农自动帮助贫农种麦，贫农没牲口的困难解决了。中农说：“中贫农是一家，他有困难咱中农得帮助。”有的问村干：“看谁有多少没种上？有啥困难？提吧。”贫农便提种麦的困难，有提有三亩没种上，有的说我有亩半没种上，种麦困难的共十四户，而村子里就有十八犋牲口，自认给困难户种麦。在自认中，双方都表示了态度，有牛的说：“我晚种一晌，也得给贫农种上。”没牛力的贫农说：“有当紧的活，都去与你们作。”一个妇女又没牛又没人，他说：“我没男人，谁家有针线活作不完就说一声。”在这样互助中，十四户贫农种上了麦。此外，我各地政府进行贷款，群众中则进行了互助，以解决贫农种麦困难。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十一日电】范县东王庄，考城王老樊村贫农组织互助组，已完成种麦计划。东王庄在贫农干部带头下，于旧历九月初一日，已全部完成了种麦计划，全村除常做买卖者外，四十五户组织了四个互助组，在“大家齐动手，多种麦，多收粮”的口号下，群众情绪非常高涨，二组最早，旧历八月二十七日就完了工。四个组共地八百五十亩，除豆子、红薯、花楂外，已全部种上麦子，共种了六百七十亩，即百分之八十三强。现满地里已长出一寸高的麦苗来。考城五区王老樊村，有七户赤贫，原来都是垄地没有，村长谢万柱原先靠晒盐过活，谢万保是个瞎子，靠卖牌糊口，孙三、王二都是卖粪要饭，在土改中他们积极参加了斗争，分到八十亩地，一头小驴，这几家穷人一得到土改，生产劲头特别大，很早就配合小驴拉犁，每天犁五亩，共犁了六十多亩地。在旧历八月十五以前，别处还没有犁完地，他们却提早种上了麦子。
    【本报临城讯】王家庄响应县委号召，深入检查贫雇种麦困难，发现有七户麦地少的贫雇，如王山来家有六口人，只种了五亩麦子，经干部研究讨论后，拿出了校田及未分果实地共三十四亩，适当的分给了七户麦地少的贫雇，解决了他们的困难。（福广、李珍、开玉）
