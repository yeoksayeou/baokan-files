During this week, good news has been frequently reported from all the counter-offensive armies across the country.

	Jiaodong Battlefield: From the 3rd to the 9th of this month, the People's Liberation Army, after six days and nights of fierce fighting in the Changyi southern region, achieved a great victory by annihilating over 12,000 enemies. The entire four regiments of the 159th Brigade of the 64th Division of the Chiang bandits, the entire 211th Brigade of the 45th Division, and two battalions of the reorganized 9th Division were wiped out. Besides the killed and wounded, over 8,000 people, including the commander of the 211th Brigade, Zhang Zhongzhong, were captured alive. Taking advantage of the victory, the Jiaodong Liberation Army recovered Changyi, Qixia, and Weihaiwei City. Yexian was also recovered after the annihilation of the 5th Regiment (minus one battalion) of the Independent Brigade of the 8th Division, the transport battalion of the 42nd Brigade of that division, and the entire Yexian Brigade and Changyi "Homecoming Corps." The Liberation Army now completely controls the Yantai-Weixian Highway and the Yexian-Weixian section. The Jiaodong victory marks that our army in this area has not only completely smashed the enemy's key offensive but also entered a counter-offensive. Chiang bandit Fan Hanjie has led his troops to attack Jiaodong for over a month, losing nearly 30,000 soldiers, while gaining only a few empty cities. Now the People's Liberation Army has tightly closed the Jiaodong gateway, and the remnant bandits are in a dilemma, facing the doom of even greater annihilation. To cooperate with the Jiaodong operation, our Bohai army captured Qidong County on the 3rd, and our Lunan army captured the important town of Lanling, east of Yixian County, on the 4th, annihilating over 500 enemies and directly approaching the outskirts of Yixian County.

	Yu-Wan-Su Battlefield: After annihilating 5,000 enemies last week, our Chen-Su army cleared out the remnant bandits on the 800-li front from Weichuan in eastern Henan to Sixian in northern Anhui between the 8th and 12th, successively liberating and recovering the twelve towns and cities newly and formerly occupied by the enemy, including Linquan (9th), Shenqiu, Tongxu (9th), Zhuxian Town, Weishi, Weichuan (10th), Lingbi (11th), Sixian, Fuyang, Xincai, Fugou, and Yanling (12th). The Yu-Wan-Su Liberation Army also cooperated in the battle, recovering Suixian County on the 8th, and annihilating over 1,400 enemies.

	E-Yu-Wan Battlefield: The Liu-Deng Eastern Route Army captured Huoshan County again on the 3rd, and on the 8th, they annihilated a part of the directly subordinate units of the Chiang bandit 88th Division and the entire 62nd Brigade in the northeast of Huoshan, killing, wounding, and capturing over 5,000 enemies below the deputy brigade commander of the 62nd Brigade, and recovering the important stronghold of Shucheng again. The Western Route Army continued to liberate Huang'an City, liberated Luotian on the 5th, and from the 8th to the 9th, successively annihilated the New 17th Brigade of the 56th Division and the 33rd Brigade of the 52nd Division in the area south of Huang'an and east of Huangpi, killing, wounding, and capturing a total of over 1,800 enemies, and capturing important strongholds such as Songbu, Zhongguan Post, and Hekou Town. Another part of our army captured the important town of Tuanfeng on the northern bank of the Yangtze River, only 130 li by waterway west of Wuhan, on the 9th, shocking the Chiang bandits in Wuhan.

	Northwest Battlefield: Echoing the victory in Jiaodong, the Northwest People's Liberation Army captured Qingyuan County, an important communication point on the Xianyang-Yulin Highway in northern Shaanxi of the Chiang-Hu army, on the 11th. The defending enemies in the city, the headquarters of the 76th Division, the headquarters of the reorganized 24th Brigade, the 70th Regiment of that brigade, and one regiment of the 72nd Regiment, were all wiped out, and thousands of enemies, including the commander of the reorganized 76th Division, Liao Ang, the chief of staff of the division, Liu Xuechao, and the commander of the 24th Brigade, Zhang Xin, were captured. The capture of this city by us has made the situation of the Chiang army trapped in Yan'an and Suide City on the northern front even more precarious. In addition, the Eastern Route Liberation Army, which advanced into the rear of Chiang and Hu to fight, after meeting in the famous military stronghold of Huanglong Mountain area in northern Shaanxi at the beginning of this month, successively liberated the vast area south of Luochuan and Yichuan, north of Yaoxian and Chaoyi, between the Xianyang-Yulin Highway and the Yellow River from the 30th of last month to the 4th of this month, and continued to sweep south. Wherever the army went, the Chiang bandits collapsed at the sight of it. On the 8th, Ganjiang Town in the northwest of @yang was liberated, and the entire battalion of local reactionaries was annihilated. On the 11th, Hancheng, where the Chiang-controlled Yellow River Defense Headquarters was located, was liberated in one fell swoop, annihilating the 158th Regiment of the 53rd Brigade of the 90th Division of the Hu army and its two battalions, as well as two companies of the field artillery battalion of the 78th Brigade of the First Division, and two battalions of local reactionaries, killing and capturing a total of over 2,300 people. The Chiang army's retreat has been completely cut off by our army. The fate of the Chiang and Hu bandits trapped in various strongholds in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is even closer to destruction.

	The Chen-Xie army, which advanced into southern Shaanxi to liberate Shangnan, has victoriously joined forces with the nine local guerrilla units that have been fighting tenaciously behind enemy lines for over a year. At the moment, the guerrilla units are actively cooperating with the main force to fiercely attack the stubborn bandits. The masses in Shangxian, Luonan, and other places were encouraged by the news of our army's liberation of Shangnan, and they rose up to resist grain, resist taxes, and resist conscription, taking active actions to strike at the rule of the Chiang bandits and welcome the liberating army. Our guerrilla corps, active near Luoyang, successively liberated the important strongholds of Gushui and Yanqiu, west and southwest of Luoyang, from the 5th to the 7th. The defending local reactionaries were completely annihilated. Another part of the Liberation Army captured Songxian County in western Henan again on the night of the 5th.

	Northeast Battlefield: Since the autumn offensive of the Democratic Allied Army, the offensive has continued to develop with a sweeping force, after annihilating more than 30,000 enemies in succession. On the 7th, it captured Zhangwu City, northwest of Shenyang, in one fell swoop. By this time, Shenyang was under the pincer attack of our army. The Chiang bandits in the city were greatly panicked, "prices have been rising continuously, there is no market for grain, and rich people have left here one after another" (United Press, Shenyang, 13th). Another part of the Democratic Allied Army, with rapid action, captured Heishan and Xinlitun on the Dahushan-Tongliao Railway on the 9th, completely annihilating the headquarters of the Provisional 57th Division and the remaining two regiments of that division, a total of 3,500 people, and cutting off the Jinzhou-Yixian and Shenyang-Jinzhou sections of the railway, forming a line of operations with our army between Jinzhou and Shanhaiguan in the middle section of the Beining Railway.

	A part of the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army launched an offensive towards the area west of Shouyang City in the western section of Zhengtai on the 4th, and immediately captured the important town of Zong'ai and more than ten strongholds such as Zhoujia'nao and Guangshan, annihilating over 1,500 Chiang soldiers.

　　我紧闭胶东门户残匪进退两难陈谢与九支游击队在陕南会师
    本周间，全国各路反攻大军捷报频传。
    胶东战场：人民解放军于本月三日至九日，在昌（邑）南地区经六昼夜激战，造成歼敌一万二千余之大捷。全歼蒋匪六十四师一五九旅之四个团，四十五师之二一一旅全部及整九师二个营，除毙伤外，生俘二一一旅旅长张中忠以下八千余人，胶东解放军乘胜收复昌邑、栖霞与威海卫市，掖县亦于歼敌第八师独立旅第五团（缺一个营）及该师四十二旅之输送营与掖县大队及昌邑“还乡团”全部后，为我收复。现解放军完全控制烟（台）潍（县）公路掖（县）潍（县）段。胶东大捷标志该地区我军不仅完全粉碎敌之重点进攻，而且进入了反攻，蒋匪范汉杰率部进攻胶东为时月余，损兵折将已近三万人，而所得仅几座空城。刻人民解放军已紧闭胶东门户，残匪进退两难，正面临更大歼灭性打击的厄运。为配合胶东作战，渤海我军三日攻克齐东县城，鲁南我军于四日攻克峄县东之兰陵重镇，歼敌五百余，直逼峄县城郊。
    豫皖苏战场：我陈粟大军于上周歼敌五千之后，又于八日至十二日间，于西迄豫东之洧川，东至皖北之泗县，长达八百里战线上肃清残匪，先后解放并收复新旧被敌侵陷之临泉（九日）、沈邱、通许（九日）、朱仙镇、尉氏、洧川（十日）、灵璧（十一日）、泗县、阜阳、新蔡、扶沟、鄢陵（十二日）等十二座城镇；豫皖苏解放军并配合作战，于八日收复睢县，共歼敌一千四百余名。

    西北战场：与胶东胜利遥相辉映，西北人民解放军于十一日一举攻克蒋胡军咸（阳）榆（林）公路陕北段重要联络点之清原县城，该城守敌七十六师师部，整二十四旅旅部，及该旅之七十团及七十二团之一个团，无一漏网，歼俘敌整七十六师师长廖昂、师参谋长刘学超，二十四旅旅长张新等以下数千人。该城之被我攻克，使困守延安及北线绥德城内之蒋军，处境更为危殆。另我挺进蒋胡后方作战之东路解放大军，于本月初会师于陕北著名军事要地黄龙山地区后，上月三十日至本月四日，相继解放洛川、宜川以南，耀县、朝邑以北，咸榆公路与黄河间之广大地区，并继续向南扫荡。大军所至，蒋匪望风披靡。八日，解放＠阳西北甘井镇，土顽一营全部被歼。十一日又一举解放蒋记黄河河防指挥部所在地之韩城。歼灭胡军九十师五十三旅一五八团团直及其两个营，与第一师七十八旅野炮营之两个连。以及地方土顽两个营，共毙俘二千三百余人。蒋军退路已完全被我军切断。困守陕甘宁边区各据点内之蒋胡匪，其覆灭的命运已更为逼近。
    挺进陕南解放商南之陈谢大军，已与孤悬敌人后方、坚持斗争年余之当地九支游击队胜利会师，刻该游击队正积极配合主力痛击顽匪。商县、雒南等地群众，为我军解放商南消息所鼓舞，纷起以抗粮、抗款、抗丁，积极行动，打击蒋匪统治，迎接解放大军。活跃于洛阳附近之我游击兵团，五日至七日则先后解放洛阳以西及西南蒋军重要据点谷水、延秋等重镇。守敌土顽全部被歼。另部解放军于五日夜再度攻克豫西之嵩县城。
    东北战场：民主联军秋季攻势以来，以席卷之势，连续歼敌三万余后，攻势继续发展。七日一举攻占沈阳西北之彰武城，至此沈阳即处于我大军钳击之下，该城蒋匪已大起恐慌，“物价连续上涨，粮食已无市场，有钱的人纷纷离此他去”（合众社沈阳十三日电）。另部民主联军于九日以神速动作，攻克打（虎山）通（辽）铁路线上之黑山及新立屯，全歼暂五十七师师部及该师残剩之两个团，共计三千五百人。并截断锦（州）义（县）及沈（阳）锦（州）段铁路。与北宁路中段锦州，山海关间我军形成一线作战。
