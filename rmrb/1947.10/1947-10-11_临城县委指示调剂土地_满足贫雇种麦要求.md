　　Lincheng County Party Committee Directs Adjustment of Land
  　To Meet the Wheat Planting Requirements of Poor and Hired Peasants
    [Report from this newspaper, Lincheng] At the Lincheng county-level expanded cadre meeting in mid-September, a wheat planting plan was proposed, aiming for all the irrigated land and one-third of the dry land to be cultivated. This plan primarily focuses on the standards for poor and hired peasants, ensuring they meet these criteria. Currently, the county has completed two-thirds of the autumn harvest, with partial statistics showing over 32,000 mu of wheat planted. To further examine the wheat planting situation among poor and hired peasants, the County Party Committee convened a meeting on the 1st of this month to assess their progress. It was discovered that some poor and hired peasants who had not yet turned over still faced significant shortages in wheat planting land or had poor soil quality. For example, Zhao Jidong (a poor peasant) from within the city had a family of five but only two mu of dry land and twenty-six mu of irrigated land suitable for wheat planting. Zheng Lao Si's family of four had only three mu of land suitable for wheat planting, and he requested an additional four mu to be able to plant (the average land per person within the city is four mu). Similar situations were not uncommon. To truly meet the wheat planting needs of poor and hired peasants, ensure they can overcome the famine, and completely escape poverty, the County Party Committee has decided on the following solutions to address the wheat planting issue: 1. Village school land and public land can be temporarily allocated to poor and hired peasants for planting; 2. If the village lacks public or school land, farmers can mutually adjust land among themselves to resolve this issue; 3. For poor and hired peasants without wheat seeds, the village cooperative should allocate wheat seeds and lend them at low interest. Additionally, a portion can be temporarily borrowed from public grain or exchanged within mutual aid teams. The goal is to genuinely ensure that poor and hired peasants can cultivate all their irrigated land and one-third of their dry land with wheat. (Fu Guang, Feng Ze)

　　临城县委指示调剂土地
  　满足贫雇种麦要求
    【本报临城讯】临城在九月中旬县扩干会上，提出水地全部、旱地三分之一的种麦计划，这个计划主要是以贫雇为标准，也就是说一定要使贫雇农达到这个标准。现全县秋收已完成三分之二，部分统计，已种麦三万二千余亩，县委为了更深刻的检查贫雇的种麦情况，于本月一号召开县委会，研究贫雇种麦的程度，发现还有一部未翻身的贫雇，种麦地缺额很大或地质不强，如城内赵计东（贫农）家有五口人，能种麦子的地仅旱地二亩、水地二十六亩。郑老四家有四口人，能种麦子地仅三亩，他提出再有四亩也能种上（城内地亩平均每人四亩）。类似这样的情况还不少。为了使贫雇真正满足种麦要求，顺利渡过灾荒，彻底摆脱贫困，县委会特决定解决贫雇种麦问题办法如下：一、村有校田和公地可以暂调剂给贫雇种；二、如村中没公地校田，在农民中间可以互相调剂来解决这个问题；三、无麦种的贫雇，村合作社要调剂麦种，低利贷给他们，另外可以暂从公粮上借一部分或是在互助组内进行互助交换，真正要使贫雇达到水地全部，旱地三分之一种上麦子。（福广、凤泽）
