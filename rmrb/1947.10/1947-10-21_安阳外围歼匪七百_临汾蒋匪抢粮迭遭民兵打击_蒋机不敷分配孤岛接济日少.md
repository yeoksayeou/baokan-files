Xinhua News Agency, Jinnan, 19th: Chiang Kai-shek's bandits' 40th Division and local bandits in Anyang have been looting northeast of the city for days. On the 6th, their 117th Regiment (missing one battalion) and some local bandits occupied Cuijiaqiao. On the 7th, our army counterattacked and annihilated 250 enemies outside Cuijiaqiao, seizing 11 light machine guns. On the 8th, our army detoured to Xishan澗 southwest of Cuijiaqiao to intercept another unit of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits' 40th Division and local bandits Guo Qing, Wang Ziquan, and others coming from Anyang for reinforcement. They attacked us six times from Huangjiaying and Xilianggong, but were all repelled by us. More than 500 bandits were killed or wounded. Cuijiaqiao was recovered by us, and the remaining enemies fled towards Anyang city and nearby strongholds.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyue, 19th: The Hongtong militia and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits are engaged in a fierce struggle to defend the autumn harvest on the outskirts of Linfen. On September 19th, more than 100 members of the puppet Baojing team from Luqu, under the cover of darkness, attacked Houjianzhuang through Fujing and Zhongyang Village to loot grain. They were immediately discovered by three sentries of the Houjianzhuang self-defense force, and the militia immediately responded. Upon hearing the news, Lan Shihuang, assistant of our Third District, immediately dispatched more than ten armed village public offices from ×× Village, ×× Village, and ×× Village to reinforce Houjianzhuang in two routes. During the fierce battle, another three villagers heard the gunfire and automatically reinforced, penetrating deep into the bandits' rear to launch a surprise attack. The bandits panicked and fled towards Linfen, without any losses to the masses. After this battle, the morale of our militia was even higher, and they took the initiative to attack north. The Huangdao militia team and Shang Qingfu explosion team, originally active in the Ganting area, led by hero Ji Hengyuan, took the initiative to attack within Linfen. Hero Hou Tongyi led ×× militiamen and stayed in the Houjianzhuang area, monitoring the bandits from Yingqu and Hexi. Lu Chenggong led the militia to stay in the Chengguan district, responsible for joint defense, and often set out for Hexi. On September 27th, the puppet Baojing team stationed in the Lu district braved the rain and raided our Beiyang, Ganting, and Beidu villages in the middle of the night, but were defeated by the militia led by Hou Tongyi. On September 30th, the bandits stationed in Kangzhuangpu again divided into two routes to loot grain from Dongzhang and Xizhang villages. The militia of Ji Hengyuan and Shang Qingfu cooperated with the Linfen rotation team to attack the grain-looting bandits with superior force, recovering most of the looted materials and killing one bandit, who then fled back to their lair in panic. On October 7th and 8th, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits still used more than 100 troops to loot grain from Dongzhang and Xizhang villages, but were all severely attacked and driven back by us. Now Shang Qingfu and others are strengthening mine blockades on one hand and helping the masses with the autumn harvest on the other, in order to launch a greater defense war.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 19th: Chiang's troops besieged in isolated islands such as Anyang, Linfen, and Yuncheng are all facing their final days. Because Chiang's aircraft are insufficiently allocated, the airborne aid received by the above-mentioned isolated islands is decreasing daily. Before the liberation of Yongnian, Chiang's bandits trapped there only had five liang of grain per person per day. Unable to bear the hunger, they risked their lives to break through, but were eventually completely annihilated. The enemy in Anyang has recently risked their lives to leave the city to loot grain, but has been repeatedly severely attacked by our local armed forces and militia. Linfen and Yuncheng, on the other hand, are in a state of constant panic because the airport is under our control. Yuncheng is under curfew all day, and the city gates are completely closed. The Chiang Kai-shek's special commissioner's office in the city has arrested more than 2,000 merchants, students, and strong young men in the city to form a "self-defense force" to serve as cannon fodder, and occasionally fires artillery randomly at the suburbs to embolden themselves.

　　安阳外围歼匪七百
  　临汾蒋匪抢粮迭遭民兵打击
    蒋机不敷分配孤岛接济日少
    【本报冀南十九日电】安阳蒋匪四十师一部及土顽连日向城东北外出抢掠，六日其一一七团（缺一个营）及土顽一部进占崔家桥，七日我军予以反击，在崔家桥外围歼敌二百五十余，缴轻机枪十一挺。八日我军绕道崔家桥西南之西山涧，阻击安阳来援之蒋匪四十师另一部及土顽郭清、王自全等部，由黄家营、西梁公向我进攻六次，均被我击退，毙伤匪顽五百余人，崔家桥被我收复，残敌向安阳城及附近据点逃窜。
    【本报太岳十九日电】洪洞民兵与蒋匪在临汾外围展开激烈的保卫秋收斗争。九月十九日，鲁曲之伪保警队百余人，黑夜经夫井、中羊村向我侯建庄袭击抢粮，当被我侯建庄自卫队三个哨兵发觉，民兵们即马上应战。这时我三区助理员兰室黄闻讯，立即调来××村民兵及××村、××村中之武装村公所十余人，分两路增援侯建庄。在激战中，另一村民兵三人听到枪声，又自动增援，深入到匪军屁股后面，予以奇袭，匪即惊慌向临汾逃窜，群众毫无损失。经此次战斗后，我民兵情绪更为高涨，主动向北出击，原活动于甘亭附近一带的我黄道民兵队及尚清富爆炸队，由英雄吉恒元率领，主动出击临汾境内，英雄侯同义率民兵××人，住侯建庄一带，监视莺曲与河西之杂匪，芦成功率民兵住城关区，担任联防，并经常出发河西。九月二十七日，驻鲁区之伪保警队冒雨于半夜出扰我北羊、甘亭、北杜等村，当被侯同义所率领的民兵击溃。九月三十日，住康庄堡之匪军又分两路向东西张村抢粮，吉恒元尚清富的民兵配合临汾轮战队以优势兵力向抢粮之匪攻击，将抢去之物资大部夺回，并毙匪一人，该匪即仓慌窜回老窠。十月七、八两日，蒋匪仍然以百名以上兵力向东西张村抢粮，均为我痛击收回，现尚清富等为展开更大的保卫战，一面加强地雷封锁，一面帮助群众秋收。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十九日电】困守安阳、临汾、运城等孤岛蒋军均已面临末日。因蒋机不敷分配，上述各孤岛所获空运接济已日趋减少。永年解放前，困守该地蒋匪每人每日仅食五两粮食，饥不可忍始冒死突围，终被全部歼灭。安阳敌近日亦冒死出城抢粮，迭遭我地方武装与民兵痛击。临汾、运城则因机场为我控制，守敌更惶惶不可终日。运城终日戒严，城门完全封闭，该城蒋记专署搜捕城内商民、学生、壮丁二千余人，编“自卫队”充炮灰，并不时向城郊胡乱放炮借以壮胆。
