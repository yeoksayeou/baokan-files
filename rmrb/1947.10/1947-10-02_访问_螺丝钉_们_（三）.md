Visiting the “Screws” (Three)
　　Yù Míng
　　The Flying Squad Communication Platoon
　　“Communication soldier, communication soldier, running errands all day long.” Is being a communication soldier a tough job? With this in mind, I visited the comrades of the communication platoon, but the impression I got was quite the opposite.
　　Their room was clean and tidy, with self-made huqin, guns, and ammunition belts hanging on the wall. The platoon only had the platoon leader, Mèng Débǎo, and Wú Néngyún, both energetic young fellows, who greeted me into the room with smiles. They chatted with me without any restraint, as intimate as old friends who hadn't seen each other for years, as if they had been holding back their words for years and couldn't stop talking once they started.
　　"Our platoon originally had fourteen people," Mèng Débǎo said, "This year, to support the front line, half were reduced, but the work is still just as much - delivering letters to forty units. But the work hasn't been done poorly, it's even more energetic than before. When there are letters, everyone competes to deliver them. Almost everyone can walk one hundred and twenty *li* a day, and two hundred and forty *li* can be done in two days round trip. Sixty *li* can be done in one day. We would rather let people wait for letters than let letters wait for people." If there were books and newspapers, and the animals weren't home, they would carry thirty or forty *jin* on their backs and deliver them. More people would carry them together. "We won't let people wait for letters, but we won't let letters wait for people."
　　Why so energetic? Comrade Mèng Débǎo said that the comrades in his platoon are all liberated peasants, and their families now have enough to eat and drink. Fighting Chiang Kai-shek is to protect the land, houses, and property they have been given. The better the work is done, the faster Chiang Kai-shek will be defeated. Because they have such a clear purpose and firm belief, they have inexhaustible strength and amazing stories. Mèng Débǎo and Wú Néngyún both have young wives at home, and they are not far from home, but they have not been home for a year or two. Lǐ Rúbǎo received two or three letters from his family urging him to go back and get married, but he ignored them. Later, his father ran to call him back, but he sent his father back with kind words. He said that fighting Old Chiang is a big deal now, and it won't be too late to go back and get married after defeating Old Chiang in two or three years!
　　Their learning progress is even more amazing. When they were at home, in their words, "White paper, black characters, he knows me, I don't know it," but after joining the army for two or three years, they can now write ordinary letters and diaries. On their desk, there is a paper-pasted letter holder, with a not-so-good portrait of Chairman Mao, like a drawing by a primary school student, hanging with two not-very-good fountain pens, and "Lǐ Yǒucái Teahouse." They are very enthusiastic about learning, and when they are not delivering letters or producing, they climb on the desk to read or write diaries. Sometimes, after running one hundred and twenty *li*, they don't even bother to eat, and run to cultural classes or listen to political classes.
　　I read five of their diaries. In these diaries, there is a burning of their high working enthusiasm, revealing their happy life, and a strong desire to improve. Mèng Débǎo wrote in his diary on August 25th: "After eating lunch, I braved the rain to send a letter to Niútóu. I took 77,100 *Jì* currency from the secretary's office. On the way back, I found that I didn't have a receipt. I thought for a while and ran back to ask for a receipt. In the kitchen of the Niútóu family factory, I sat with Old Luó for a while, who was liberated from the last battle. He said that it was wrong for the village to beat a deserter. I felt that Old Luó's thinking was wrong. The masses have great vision, and the masses said that he brought back a Browning pistol when he ran back. Where did the gun come from? We are the people's army and should help the masses to turn themselves over. He is a good person and a basic mass, and the masses will not beat him."
　　Their diaries attracted me to read for a long time, and then I talked to them about the methods of keeping diaries before walking out.

　　访问“螺丝钉”们　（三）
    毓明
  　飞毛腿的通讯班
    “通讯员，通讯员，一天跑腿不得闲。”通讯员是一个苦差使吧？为了这个，我去访问了通讯班的同志，但给我的印象却恰恰相反。
    他们的房子里，干净整洁，墙上挂着自己造的胡琴、枪和子弹带。班里只有班长孟德保和吴能云，都是朝气勃勃的青年小伙子，笑着把我迎进房里。他们和我拉话，毫不拘束，好象多年不见的老朋友一般亲切，想说的话，好象蹩了多少年没说话似的滔滔不绝的说也说不完了。
    “我班原先共有十四个人”，孟德保说道：“今年为了支援前线，减去了一半，工作还是一般般多——送四十个单位的信。但工作没有做坏，比从前还带劲了。有了信，你争我夺，抢着去送。差不多每个人一天都能走一百二十里，二百四十里的地方两天可以来回。六十里的地方，一天就可回来。”如果有了书报，牲口不在家，三四十斤，一个人就背着送走了。多了两人伙抬。能叫人等信，不叫信等人。”
    为什么这样带劲呢？孟德保同志说，他班的同志都是翻身农民，家里现在都有了吃喝，打蒋介石是为了保住自己分得的土地、房屋、财产。工作越做得好，打垮蒋介石越快。因为他们有了这样明确的目的和坚强的信念，就产生了用不尽的力量，产生了惊奇的故事。孟德保、吴能云家里都有年轻的老婆，离家也没有多远，然而他们一两年没有回过家。李如保，他家给他来了两三封信，催他回去结婚，他没有理睬。后来他爹又跑来叫他，但他又用好话把他爹打发回去了。他说现在打老蒋事大，再熬两三年打垮老蒋回去结婚也不迟！
    他们的学习进步，更是惊人。他们在家时拿他们的话说，白纸上字黑道，他认识我，我不认识它，可是参军后二三年内，已能写普通信件及日记了。他们办公桌上，贴了一个纸糊的信插子，信插上画着毛主席不象张肖像，象小学生画的一样，挂着两支不很好的水笔，还有“李有才茶话”。他们学习热情很高，不送信、不生产时，即爬在桌上看书或写日记。有时候，跑了一百二十里路回来，连饭也顾不得吃，就跑去上文化课，或听政治课。
    我看了他们五本日记。在这几本日记里，燃烧着他们高度的工作热情，流露着他们愉快的生活，强烈的上进心。孟德保，八月二十五日的日记上这样写到：“吃了下午饭，我冒看雨去牛头送信去，在秘书处拿了冀钞七万七千一百元，回到半路上，发现没有打回收条，自己思想了一阵，又跑回去要回收条。在牛头家属工厂伙房里，和老罗坐了一阵，他是上当战役解放过来的。他说村上打一个逃亡军人不对。我感到老罗的思想不对。群众眼光大，群众说他跑回时带着一支驳壳枪。枪是那里来的？我们是人民军队，应该帮助群众翻身，他是好人，是基本群众，群众不会打他。”
    他们的日记把我吸引住看了半天，又和他们谈了些记日记的方法，然后才走出来。
