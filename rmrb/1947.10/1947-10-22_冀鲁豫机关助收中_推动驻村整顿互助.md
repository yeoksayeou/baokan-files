　　Ji-Lu-Yu Organs Assist in Autumn Harvest
  　Promoting Mutual Assistance in Stationed Village Rectification
    [Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 20th Dispatch] To enrich the foundation for the counter-offensive victory, all organs, troops, and schools in the Ji-Lu-Yu region are combining with the masses and plunging into the upsurge of autumn harvest and wheat planting. The district party committee organs send an average of 239 cadres and miscellaneous personnel every day, totaling 3,130 mu of mung beans, soybeans, and corn harvested, 272 mu of crops transported, 339 mu of corn shucked, 200 mu bound, and 6 mu of irrigation, in addition to many other tasks such as threshing, transporting sorghum stalks, and loading carts. Everyone's enthusiasm is extremely high. The guard battalion headquarters and × company participated with a total of 80 people, 75 of whom developed blisters on their hands, but they continued to work persistently. Comrade Jia Jianhua of the mimeograph section went to the autumn harvest during the day and cut stencils at night. While assisting in the harvest, everyone paid attention to understanding the concerns and demands of the masses. The organs also issued production bulletins, commending models, and exchanging experiences, especially promoting mutual assistance and work point recording among the villagers stationed in the village, because the original mutual aid was not well organized, and the masses thought the mutual aid group was a "muddled group." After we helped implement work point recording, everyone felt that it was not troublesome and had many benefits. Currently, the village is rushing to plant wheat, preparing to complete it before the 15th day of the ninth lunar month. All employees of the Ji-Lu-Yu Printing Bureau are working hard pulling plows, harrows, and seeders, planting 214 mu of wheat in a single day on the 12th. Female comrades who were physically weaker participated in cooking and delivering water. The Minyou Drama Troupe, which was transformed from an old opera troupe, was very active in participating in the autumn harvest and wheat planting. Originally, it was stipulated that female comrades should not go, but they protested. Comrades from the Yuncheng County Working Group and the Armed Forces Committee, due to being in a Henan environment, were particularly busy, but still extracted most of the comrades to help with the autumn harvest and wheat planting, which was very well received by the masses.
    [Another Dispatch] The Ji-Lu-Yu Special Service Battalion summarized their mass work over the past month, with 128 people participating, carrying more than 17,570 loads of water, carrying more than 1,500 loads of corn and millet, and turning over 264 mu of sweet potato seedlings. When helping with the autumn harvest, they organized and planned the autumn harvest with the masses. All 1,129 mu of crops in the village were harvested in three days, and they are now helping the masses plant wheat. Many comrades wore out their shoulders pulling the seed drills, but their enthusiasm remained high.
    [Our Newspaper] Under the slogan of "Achieving Merits in Autumn Harvest," the companies of the Military Region Guard Regiment launched an enthusiastic competition to assist in the harvest and planting. Gao Yifang, the third squad leader of the third company, was covered in scabies and had difficulty walking, but he still led his squad to actively harvest. When the comrades asked him to rest, he insisted on continuing. The first platoon of thirty-four people "blitzed" fifteen mu of millet in fifteen minutes. The second platoon helped two elderly grandmothers in their sixties plow and plant seven mu of wheat. Deputy Political Instructor Feng Bing was also particularly tense, personally investigating which families had no labor force, thoroughly ensuring "no family left behind." The company stationed in the village had eleven qing of land, which they harvested 809 mu of. (Photo)
    [Our Newspaper] The Third Brigade of the Peking University Medical College specially suspended classes for three days from October 14th, and all teachers and students helped the families of Southern Expeditionary soldiers and poor farmers stationed in the village with the autumn harvest. Patients and physically weak female students also participated, developing blisters on their hands, but their spirit remained consistent. They also carried out propaganda for the great counter-offensive during the autumn harvest, making the masses realize that Chiang Kai-shek had reached the stage of decline. In three days, 338 people harvested 599 mu of millet, 26 mu of beans, and dug 6 mu of yam. (Geng Fu, Chao Hai)

    【本报讯】军区警卫团各连在“秋收中也要立功”的口号下，展开了热烈的助收助种竞赛运动。三连三班长高义方满身长着疥，走起路来很不方便，但仍率领全班积极收割，同志们让他休息一下，他还是坚持。一排三十四个人，十五分钟“闪击”了十五亩谷子。二排帮助两个六十余岁的老太太人拉耧犁种了七亩麦子，副政指冯冰同志也分外紧张，亲自调查谁家无劳力，彻底作到“不漏一家”。该连驻村有地十一顷，他们就给收割了八百零九亩。（影）
