Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, October 26th: In the Qingfengdian Campaign, the enemy military officers above the rank of colonel captured by us have now been identified as follows: Luo Lirong, Lieutenant General and Commander of the Third Army; Yang Guangyu, Lieutenant General and Deputy Commander of the Third Army; Li Yongzhang, Major General and Commander of the 7th Division; Ke Minsheng, Commander of the 19th Regiment of the 7th Division; Cao Xueyuan, Commander of the 20th Regiment; Shen Zhongwen, Commander of the 21st Regiment; Wu Wenlin, Commander of the 66th Regiment of the 22nd Division of the 16th Army, and others. The rest are still being verified.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, October 26th: Frontline reporters report: The unprecedented great victory of annihilating over 10,000 enemy troops in Qingfengdian is as follows: While the Chiang bandit troops defending the Pingjin-Baoding triangular area were suffering heavy blows from our northern counter-offensive forces, the Hu bandit's direct line Third Army, holed up in Shijiazhuang, finally ventured north on October 16th after being strongly urged by the Baoding Pacification Headquarters to reinforce them. Luo Lirong and Yang Guangyu, the commander and deputy commander of the Third Army, personally led more than 10,000 men and horses, and hurriedly left the landlocked island of Shijiazhuang, where they had been trapped for nearly two years. More than 200 trucks clumsily carried their families across the Hutuo River and headed north. Luo Lirong fully understood that crossing the more than 200 *li* of free land belonging to the people from Shijiazhuang to Baoding was a very risky gamble. Therefore, even before starting, he had made a four-day marching plan, drawn up detailed marching charts, and made defensive preparations, huddling together like ants moving house. On the 18th, all the troops scurried to more than 20 villages in the Qingfengdian and Wangjing area. Chiang's officers faced the "blue sky" and prayed that as long as they got through the next day, they could escape the dragnet of the Liberated Area's soldiers and civilians. However, on the same day, the Jin-Cha-Ji counter-offensive forces unexpectedly appeared around the Chiang bandits, blocking their path and surrounding the enemy layer by layer. On the 19th, our northern troops severely attacked their outposts in Qilipu. The next day (the 20th), at dawn, a large-scale annihilation battle began. Luo Lirong and his more than 10,000 men and horses were immediately frightened and panicked. In the fierce battles that lasted for two consecutive days, our troops compressed them village by village day and night, and the enemy had shrunk from five villages to three villages, building fortifications and holding on. On the 21st, in order to save his demoralized morale, Luo Lirong posted a notice on a dilapidated wall: "Commander's Order: I have received a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief (Li Wen): The southern army has been transported to Wangdu by automobile tonight, and our current predicament will be resolved by tomorrow (the 22nd)." However, on the same day, our troops launched a fierce attack from all directions at the same time. Despite the enemy planes taking turns to help, under our heroic encirclement and suppression, all of Luo Lirong's troops had to squeeze into the Southwest He Village with less than 400 households. At 4:00 a.m. on the 22nd, our army launched a general offensive against the enemy. Artillery roared, smoke filled the air, and the earth shook. Two battalions of a certain unit, which were responsible for attacking the village, stormed into the village from the southwest and stubbornly repelled several enemy counterattacks, consolidating the breakthrough. Several armies poured into the village like a huge tide in the morning light. After a fierce street battle, groups of Chiang bandits laid down their weapons. A small number of remnant bandits who broke through and fled were also captured by our ambush troops. More than 10,000 Chiang bandit troops, just as Luo Lirong had expected, finally escaped their "predicament" on the 22nd and were completely wiped out. Luo Lirong, Commander of the Third Army, Yang Guangyu, Deputy Commander, and Li Yongzhang, Commander of the Seventh Division, were all in the long line of prisoners. As for the hundreds of followers of the pseudo-army Liu Huanan's Provisional 32nd Division, on whom they had pinned their hopes, although they had come out to put on a show for more than 20 *li*, they had already tucked their tails and retreated back to Baoding under the continuous attacks of our army.

    清风店大歼灭战中
    活捉匪军长罗历戎
    副军长及师团长等无一漏网
    【新华社晋察冀前线二十六日电】清风店歼灭战中，我所俘获之敌军校级以上军官，现已查明者计有：第三军中将军长罗历戎、中将副军长杨光钰、第七师少将师长李用章、第七师十九团团长柯民生、二十团团长曹学渊、二十一团团长沈仲文、十六军二十二师六十六团团长吴文霖等人。其他尚在继续清查中。
    【新华社晋察冀前线二十六日电】前线记者报导：清风店歼敌万余人空前大捷经过如下：当防御平津保三角地带的蒋匪正遭受我北线反攻大军沉重打击时，困守石家庄的胡匪嫡系第三军，在保定绥署力促北上增援后，终于十月十六日战战兢兢的冒险北窜。第三军正副军长罗历戎、杨光钰亲率万余人马，慌慌张张的离开了他们困守将近两年的陆上孤岛——石家庄，二百余辆卡车笨重的载着眷属渡过滹沱河向北开行。罗历戎完全懂得，要越过由石庄到保定二百余里人民的自由土地，是一件万分冒险的赌柱。于是，还在出发之前，便做好了四天的行军计划，绘出了行军详图，做了防御的准备，一路紧缩一团，象蚂蚁搬家似的拥挤前进。十八日全部人马匆匆的窜至清风店、王京一带的二十几个村庄。蒋家官员面向“青天”祈祷，只要渡过明日一天，就可以逃出解放区军民的天罗地网。然而，就在当天，晋察冀反攻大军出于他们意料，突然的出现在蒋家匪徒们的周围，扼住去路，层层包围了敌人。十九日，北路我军在七里铺痛击其前哨部队后，第二天（二十日）拂晓，大规模歼灭战就开始了。罗历戎及其万余人马顿时落魂丧胆，慌做一团。连续两日的猛烈战斗，四周我军昼夜逐村压缩，敌人已由五个村缩到三个村，构筑工事困守。二十一日，罗历戎为挽救其颓丧的士气，在残破的墙壁上贴出通报：“军长谕：奉总司令（李文）电：南下大军，已于本日晚，用汽车输送到望都，我当前之困境，即至西（二十二日）可解。可是，同日我军已从四面八方同时发动猛攻，尽管敌机轮番助战，在我英勇的围击下，罗历戎的全部人马，只好拥塞在不满四百户的西南合村了。二十二日上午四时，我军乃向敌发动总攻，排炮轰鸣，烟雾弥漫，震天动地。担任攻击该村的某部两个营，自西南攻入村内，并顽强的击退敌人几次的反扑，巩固了突破口，几路大军在晨曦中即如巨潮汹涌般的卷入村内，一阵激烈巷战，成群蒋匪纷纷放下武器，少数突围逃窜残匪，亦为我伏军俘获，蒋匪万余人马，正如罗历戎所预料的一样，终于在廿二日解除“困境”，全军覆没了。第三军军长罗历戎、副军长杨光钰、第七师师长李用章都排在漫长的俘虏行列里。至于他们所寄托的由保定南下的伪军刘化南暂编三十二师的几百罗喽，虽曾支应门面的出来走了二十几里路，但在我军连续的打击下，早已夹着尾巴缩回保定去了。
