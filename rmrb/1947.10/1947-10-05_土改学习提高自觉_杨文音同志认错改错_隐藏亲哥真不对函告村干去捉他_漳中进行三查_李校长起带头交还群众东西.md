　　【Our Newspaper Reports】Comrade Yang Wenyin, Deputy Instructor of the Second Detachment of the Second Field Hospital of the Ministry of Health, after studying land reform, personally wrote to the responsible cadres of the district and village, requesting that his own elder brother, who had evaded struggle, be arrested and handed over to the people for processing. Comrade Yang Wenyin's family was a landlord family and was struggled against during the mass movement last year. His elder brother, Yang Wenhuan, was unwilling to bow his head to the masses and came to Yang Wenyin at the Second Field Hospital last year. Comrade Yang, due to his ideological ambiguity at the time, did not stand firm and gave his elder brother a travel permit, allowing him to go outside to do business. Yang Wenhuan took this travel permit and fled to Wangjia Village, Changcun Town, Tunliu, Shanxi to hide. In the land reform study, Comrade Yang Wenyin made a deep self-criticism of this matter, and then wrote a letter to the responsible cadres of the district and village, expressing his attitude.

　　【Our Newspaper's Cixian News】In early September, leading cadres of Zhangbin Middle School conducted "Three Checks" study sessions, recognizing their own positions. Comrades from petty-bourgeois and landlord backgrounds all examined their still existing countless connections with landlords. When the masses were hanging and beating landlords and landlords were being swept out of their homes, they all felt pity for the landlords and could not take the perspective of the poorest peasants' liberation as the starting point for viewing problems, emphasizing taking care of them. They also reviewed that after last year's mass movement, they actively tried to help the children of landlords continue their studies, and there was a lack of necessary struggle and criticism against teachers who had not been reformed. After the self-criticism, they all resolved to serve the people wholeheartedly. Principal Li Juchuan also resolved to "thoroughly cut off" his feudal tail, writing to village cadres, stating: "I have long wanted to put down my feudal baggage so that I can serve the people wholeheartedly. This feudal tail cannot be removed; it is not only harmful to others but also harmful to myself. I have a total of thirteen mu of paddy fields (excluding the four mu given to the masses last year), fourteen mu of dry land, as well as houses and floating assets, all to be handed over to the masses for disposal. The above is my opinion. Please announce it to the masses. After the masses raise their opinions, please notify me, and I will immediately return to the village to confess to the masses and bow my head. I will never dare to be arrogant in front of the masses..." This action influenced other faculty members to also express their determination to cut off their feudal tails. (Gong)

　　土改学习提高自觉
  　杨文音同志认错改错
  　隐藏亲哥真不对函告村干去捉他
  　漳中进行三查
  　李校长起带头交还群众东西
    【本报讯】卫生部第二野战医院第二所副指导员杨文音同志，经过这次土地改革的学习后，亲自给区、村负责干部写信，要求将自己逃避斗争的亲大哥捉回来交给人民处理。杨文音同志，家庭是个地主，去年群运时被斗，他的大哥杨文焕不愿向群众低头，在去年便找到了第二野战医院杨文音这里来，杨同志因当时思想上的模糊没站稳立场，给他大哥开了一张路条，让他到外边去作生意。杨文焕拿上这路条，便跑到了山西屯留常村镇王家庄躲避起来了。杨文音同志在土改学习中，对这件事情作了一个深刻的检讨，随后便给区、村负责干部写了一封信表明态度。（王建国）
    【本报磁县讯】漳滨中学各领导干部九月初进行了三查学习，认识自己立场，小资产阶级、地主出身的同志，都检查出对地主还有千丝万缕的联系，当群众吊打地主，地主扫地出门时，都对地主有怜悯心，不能以最贫苦农民的翻身为看问题的出发点，强调照顾。又检讨出去年群运后，积极想办法帮助地主子弟继续求学，对没有改造的地主教员也少必要的斗争与批评。检讨后都下定决心，全心全意为人民服务，李巨川校长并决心把自己的封建尾巴“彻底割掉”，致信村干部，略谓：“我早就想把我的封建包袱放下，使我一心一意为人民服务。这个封建尾巴，去不掉，不但有害别人，而且有害自己。我共有水地十三亩（除去年给群众四亩外）旱地十四亩，以及房屋浮财等完全交群众处理。以上我的意见，请大家向群众宣布，群众提出意见后，请你们通知我一声，我即回村向群众坦白低头，我决不敢在群众面前自高自大。……”这一行动影响其他教职员也纷纷表示割掉封建尾巴。（巩）
