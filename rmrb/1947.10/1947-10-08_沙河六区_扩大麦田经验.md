　　Shahe Sixth District
  　Expanding Wheat Field Experience
    [This newspaper, Shahe News] In the Shahe Sixth District, villages competed with each other under the district's leadership. The planned wheat planting area was more than 43,000 mu (the entire district has 74,000 mu of land). During plowing and planting, encouraged by the competition for merit and the propaganda of the counter-offensive victory, and with the leadership's in-depth inspection and assistance in solving the practical difficulties of poor farmers, and specific calculation of benefits, the masses' enthusiasm for expanding wheat fields greatly increased. According to statistics from 18 of the 32 villages in the district, the area has increased by more than 3,700 mu compared to the original plan. Because the organization this year resulted in faster autumn harvests and earlier plowing, and there are still many sorghum and bean stubble fields, the plan is to continue planting wheat, which will exceed the above number. The following are some experiences in expanding wheat fields:
    1. Merit-based competition is implemented throughout: From the beginning of the district-wide competition for autumn harvest to plowing and planting, the merit-based competition movement has been implemented throughout. Not only did villages challenge villages, but groups also carried out widespread and enthusiastic competitions. Every village and every group wanted to compete for merit. When the masses in Xi Cui went to the Dalian Town market, the masses in Dalian Town said, "Aren't you plowing at home? Do you want to lose to our village!" Xi Cui was two days late in starting plowing because they were applying more fertilizer to the fields. The masses pushed manure to the fields on rainy days, and plowed during the day and leveled the ground and dug field edges at night, all for fear of falling behind other villages. Groups in Dong Cui competed with each other, saying, "Our group will finish plowing and planting in a few days. How much land does your group still have to plow? You can't catch up with our group!" This stimulated the slower groups to work actively. The masses in each group in Xi Cui also proposed planting more, faster, and better wheat as a comparative condition. Just being fast is not enough.
    2. Seize past achievements, calculate benefits, and enlighten the masses: Last spring, people were called on to plant more indigo. Those who planted it became rich. Every mu of indigo was worth five or six mu of grain. In the summer, wasteland was reclaimed to plant more buckwheat. This year, the buckwheat grew particularly well. Those who did not plant indigo and buckwheat, or planted less, all regretted it. This time, everyone learned from past lessons when planting wheat. The masses in Ge Village, Dong Cui, said, "We suffered a great loss by not planting indigo. We didn't seize the opportunity to plant more buckwheat. This time we must seize the opportunity to plant wheat." Some people did not have fertilizer and were unwilling to plant more. Ge Village, Ji Village and other villages also calculated accounts for the masses, saying, "If we don't grow grain, we won't have manure. If we plant one more mu of wheat this year, we can buy manure for three mu of land next year. If we don't plant this year, we still won't be able to buy manure next year." The households in Zhao Si Shui who did not plant wheat last year did not eat white steamed buns this year. The leadership proposed slogans such as "Don't plant a thousand acres of land, don't harvest ten thousand stones of grain," "One autumn equals three autumns," and "If you plow well this year without watering, you are guaranteed a good harvest next year." The masses understood the benefits of planting more wheat, which further stimulated the demand for expanding wheat fields.
    3. Conduct in-depth inspections, discover problems, and solve practical difficulties: The leadership first conducted in-depth inspections of each household in Nan Wang Village, and immediately launched an inspection movement throughout the district, checking the population, land, and wheat planting area, and helping honest poor farmers, and military dependents and widows to solve their difficulties. The Zhang Qing Sheng group in Xi Cui, after plowing their own group's land, helped Cha's mother, Li Tong Zhen and other households without labor to plow and plant wheat, generally by paying wages or exchanging labor for textiles. Nan Wang Village made adjustments to the land, and Chang Zhuang distributed the land that had not been distributed in the past. According to inspections in Xi Cui, Putongdian, and Nan Wang villages, 69 households lacked labor and land. After helping them solve the problems, they increased wheat fields by 113 mu.
    4. Publicize the victory of the counter-offensive, and expand wheat fields and compete with the front line: In publicizing the news of the victory of the counter-offensive, the current plowing and planting of wheat was combined to encourage the masses' enthusiasm for planting wheat. Each village held mass rallies at dusk on the fifteenth day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar, using the practical actions of expanding wheat planting and giving preferential treatment to military families to celebrate the victory on the front line. The slogans were: "The front expands the liberated area, and the rear increases the wheat planting area," "If you want a quick victory, you must plant more wheat," and "The front liberates a city, and the rear plants one more mu of wheat." The masses in Xi Cui Village used expanding wheat fields and supporting the military as conditions for competition with the victory on the front line, planting 70 mu more than the original plan. At the same time, the propaganda of the victory news gave a serious blow to the idea of ​​changing the world, and directly supported the honest farmers. For example, ××× in Nan Wang Village, with five people, only planted five mu of wheat. After the propaganda, he said, "We are about to hit Nanjing, and the dog days can't come to us here." They adjusted for him another four mu of good land and planted wheat.
    Each village has generally started drilling since August 16 (lunar calendar) (the rain in the past few days has delayed things). The 17th and 18th were the most tense periods of sowing. By the 18th, 25,000 mu had been planted in the district. The district estimates that 50,000 mu of wheat will be planted this year, reaching nearly 70% of the total land area (74,000 mu), and it can be completed by August 20. At present, each village is preparing to carry out a district-wide merit evaluation and model selection movement after the 20th.

　　沙河六区
  　扩大麦田经验
    【本报沙河讯】沙河六区，各村在区上竞赛，订的种麦计划是四万三千多亩（全区七万四千亩地）。在犁地种麦中，由于竞赛立功和宣传反攻胜利的鼓舞，又加领导上的深入检查帮助贫苦农民解决实际困难，与具体计算利益，群众扩大麦田的情绪大为高涨，全区三十二个村庄，据十八个村的统计，比原订计划增多三千七百多亩，因为今年组织起来，收秋快、犁地早，还有不少的高粱、豆茬地，还准备继续种麦，还要超过以上的数目。扩大麦田中有以下几点经验：
    一、立功竞赛贯彻始终：从秋收开始全区的大竞赛起，直到犁地种麦，都贯串了竞赛立功运动，不但村与村挑了战，组与组也都进行了普遍的热烈的竞赛，每村每组都想争先立功，西崔群众到褡裢镇赶集，褡裢镇群众说：“你们不在家犁地，想输给俺村了吧！”西崔因为往地里上肥多，犁地下手迟了两天，群众在下雨天就往地里推粪，晴了天白天犁地夜间平地、刨地头，都怕落在别村后边，东崔组与组互相竞赛说：“俺组再有几天就犁完种上了，你组还有多少地没犁，怎样也赶不上俺组了！”刺激了慢组也积极干起来。西崔各组群众又提出种的麦子多、快、好，作为比较条件，光图快还不算。
    二、抓住过去成绩，计算利益，打通群众思想：春天号召多种靛，谁种上就发了财，每亩靛能顶五、六亩谷，夏天又开荒多种荞麦，今年荞麦又长的特别好，没种靛和荞麦，或种少的户都后悔了。这次种麦都接受了过去教训，东崔葛村群众说：“靛没种上，吃了大亏，荞麦种的少也没抓住，这次种麦可要捉住哩。”有的没肥，不愿多种，葛村、冀庄等村也给群众算帐说：“咱们打不下粮食就闹不下粪，现在多种一亩麦子，明年就能多买三亩地的粪。今年不种，明年还是没法买粪。”赵泗水去年没种麦的户，今年就没吃上白馍馍。领导上提出：“不种千顷地，不打万石粮”，“一秋顶三秋”，“今年垧好不用浇，明年保险收的好”等口号，群众算清了多种麦的好处，更启发了扩大麦田的要求。
    三、深入检查，发现问题，解决实际困难：领导上先在南汪村深入挨户检查，发现问题马上就在全区掀起了检查运动，查人口、查土地、查种麦数，而向老实的贫苦农民，和军属孤寡，帮助他们解决困难。西崔张庆生等组，犁完本组的地，就帮助茶的娘、李同振等没劳力户犁地种麦，一般是出工资或纺织还工，南汪村把土地做了调剂，常庄分配了过去未分的土地。根据西崔、普通店、南汪三村，检查出缺少劳力土地的有六十九户，帮助解决了问题后，他们就增加了一百一十三亩麦田。
    四、宣传反攻胜利，扩大麦田和前方竞赛：在宣传反攻胜利消息中，结合了当前的犁地种麦鼓舞了群众的种麦情绪，各村在八月十五日黄昏又都召开了群众大会，用扩大种麦和优待军属的实际行动，庆贺前线的胜利，口号是：“前方扩大解放区，后方增加种麦地”，“要想胜利快就得多种麦”，“前方解放一座城，后方多种一亩麦”。西崔村群众用扩大麦田和优军作为与前线胜利的竞赛条件，比原订计划多种七十亩。同时宣传胜利消息给了变天思想以严重的打击，直接给老实农民撑了腰，如南汪村×××，五口人只种五亩麦，经过宣传以后，他说：“咱们快打到南京呀，狗日的们可来不了咱这了”。又调剂给他四亩好地都种上麦子。
    各村自八月十六（阴历）已普遍开始插耧，（前几天下雨误了事），十七、十八是下种的最紧张时期，到十八日止全区已种上的有二万五千亩，全区估计今年种麦五万亩，达到总地亩（七万四千亩）百分之七十弱，到八月二十日就可全部完成。现各村正在准备二十号后，进行全区性的评功选模运动。
