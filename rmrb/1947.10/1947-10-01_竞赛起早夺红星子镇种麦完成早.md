　　[From our newspaper in Licheng] Zizhen Township has achieved great results in wheat planting this year. The entire village completed planting the regular crop of wheat four days ago, and the replanting is in progress. The experience is as follows: 1. Before planting, the leadership put forward the slogan of expanding wheat fields to make up for the poor harvest. First, a meeting of poor peasants and hired laborers was convened to mobilize them. Party members, heroes, and cadres went deep into the mutual aid teams to persuade everyone by calculating accounts and explaining the situation, expanding the wheat fields. 2. In order to ensure that planting was completed on schedule, Ying Yang Caifeng mobilized seven women to form a water-carrying team to carry water for the men (the well is twenty zhang deep, and regular work cannot proceed without it) and feed the livestock. Yan Yinge led five women and three daughters to carry water themselves, promoting the organization of sixty-four women and thirty-three boys and girls to carry water, cut sesame, and help plant wheat, saving 153 male labor days. 3. The masses in this village used to leave home when the sun was a pole high. At a cadres' meeting, Wang Baoer said: "Ren Shuying's team arrives in the field when the sun rises, and can plow one more mu a day. If our village wants to complete wheat planting early, we must start early." The leadership then put forward the slogan "Three earlies equal one work day, guaranteeing early completion of wheat planting," launching a Red Star seizing movement throughout the village to compete to start early in the fields. The old men were the first to agree. The young people thought that it was okay to start early to seize the Red Star, but they were afraid of falling asleep and not waking up. Ren Tingxiang, a sixty-year-old man, said: "As long as the young people can get up early, leave it to me!" He took the initiative to be responsible for waking people up early. The Chikou Brigade asked the old landlord Sun Xiaotu to get up early and knock on doors to wake people up. As a result, all the labor and livestock in the village were in the fields at daybreak, saving 2,550 work days in three days. The competition method was to hang a large Red Star, an airplane, and a car on the propaganda pavilion. Each team had a wooden stake. As soon as the people and animals of a team set off, they would hang their team's flag on the Red Star, then on the airplane, and finally on the car. After the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, a summary was made, and the team that seized the most Red Stars was called the Red Star Brigade, thus earning merit.

　　竞赛起早夺红星子镇种麦完成早
    【本报黎城讯】子镇今年种麦成绩很大，全村正茬麦于前四天下了种，改茬正进行中，经验如下：一、下种前领导上就提出扩大麦田弥补歉收的口号，首先召开贫雇户会议动员，党员英雄和干部就深入到互助组用算帐和解释打通大家思想，扩大了麦田。二、为了使下种不出节，提前完成了，英杨彩凤就动员七个妇女组织担水组，替男人担水（井深二十丈非误正工不行）、喂牲口，阎引蛾领导五个妇女三个女儿来亲自担＠，推动组织起六十四个妇女，三十三个男女儿童担水，割芝麻、帮助栽麦，节省男劳力一五三个工。三、本村群众每天是太阳上来一竿多高，人马才出门，干部会上王保儿说：“任树英组太阳出山就到了地，一天就能多耕一亩，咱村要想早完成种麦，非起早不行。”领导上便提出“三早顶一工，保证种麦早完成”的口号，掀起了全村竞赛起早上地的夺红星运动。老汉们首先赞成，青年们认为夺红星起早到可以，就是怕睡着醒不了，六十岁老汉任廷祥说：“只要年轻人能起早，叫人归我”！自动负责起早叫人。池口大队叫老地主孙小秃起早挨门叫人。这样一来全村劳畜力天明便都到了地，三天省工二五五○个。竞赛办法是宣传亭上挂着一个大红星，一个飞机，一个汽车，各队一个木桩，那一队人畜都出发了，便把本队的旗挂在红星上，第二挂在飞机上，第三挂在汽车上。秋收秋耕后总结，那队夺红星多就称为红星大队，以此立功。
