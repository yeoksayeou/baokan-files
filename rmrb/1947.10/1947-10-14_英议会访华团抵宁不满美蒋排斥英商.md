Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: The British Parliamentary Delegation arrived in Nanjing by plane from Hong Kong on the evening of the 9th. The delegation includes six members of the British House of Commons and House of Lords, and the leader is Labour Party Member of Parliament Lord Ammon. It is said that the delegation will stay in China for a month, visiting Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, Tamsui, Hankou, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and other places, and will visit industrial and cultural institutions in the Chiang-controlled areas. According to sources in Nanjing, Lord Ammon hosted Chinese and foreign journalists at the British Embassy in Nanjing on the morning of the 10th, expressing the urgent desire of the United Kingdom to conclude a "trade agreement" with the Chiang bandit authorities, and expressing considerable dissatisfaction with the Chiang bandit authorities' ban on foreign ships entering ports, which was stipulated to facilitate its American masters' monopoly of Chinese port interests. Mr. Ammon said: "The British industrial and commercial circles that have invested in China are eager to prepare for resumption of business, but are often restricted by the current Chinese ban on foreign merchant ships entering ports. The reason why the Sino-British trade agreement has been delayed is this." He also said that this "method" "not only excludes people from outside, but also prohibits itself from within (referring to the impact on Chinese exports)." Mr. Ammon declared: During the delegation's stay in China, "it is happy to discuss issues between China and the United Kingdom with anyone, but has no right to make any agreements." He also reiterated the United Kingdom's "concern for Far Eastern issues." British Ambassador to China, Sir Stevenson, who accompanied Mr. Ammon to the reception, said that the Chiang side's proposed Sino-British trade agreement "counter-proposal" is being "considered in turn" by relevant British departments.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Nanjing News: Hong Kong Governor Alexander Grantham, accompanied by his Financial Secretary Farrell and other consultants, flew from Hong Kong to Nanjing on the 1st for a "formal visit" to the Chiang government. After staying for four days, he flew back to Hong Kong yesterday morning. According to a Central News Agency report from Hong Kong on the 29th, the purpose of Mr. Grantham's "visit" was mainly to discuss "preventing smuggling activities in South China" and "improving business relations between Hong Kong and mainland China," and to discuss how to implement the "Financial and Economic Cooperation Agreement" signed by the Chiang and Hong Kong sides in Hong Kong on August 15. However, as a result of the discussions, the two sides have not yet reached an agreement on these issues. According to the Chiang-Hong Kong "Financial and Economic Cooperation Agreement," it was originally intended to allow American forces to extend into Hong Kong under the guise of Chiang's "anti-smuggling" and increase Chiang's foreign exchange income in US dollars, which is what Mr. Grantham actually meant when he said that "this agreement is very beneficial to China (referring to the Chiang government)." The agreement has suffered setbacks since it was signed under American pressure. The full text of the agreement was originally scheduled to be announced on August 23, but was "delayed" at the "request" of the British side. Since then, negotiations between the Chiang and Hong Kong sides on this matter have never been interrupted. Grantham's trip to Guangzhou on August 27 and Sun Ke's stay in Hong Kong in early September were clearly related to this.

　　英议会访华团抵宁不满美蒋排斥英商
    【新华社陕北十二日电】英议会访华团已于九日晚由港飞抵南京。该团包括英上下两院议员六人，团长为工党议员亚蒙勋爵。据称，该团在华将停留一月，访问北平、天津、上海、淡水、汉口、重庆、广州等地，并参观蒋区工业及文化机构。据南京消息，亚蒙勋爵曾于十日晨在南京英国大使馆招待中外记者，表明英国与蒋匪当局缔结“商约”之急切愿望，并对蒋匪当局为便利其美国主子独占中国港口利益规定之禁止外国船进口办法，颇表不满。亚氏称：“英国曾在华投资之工商界均渴望准备复业，惟每为中国目前实施之禁止外国商船入口办法所限制，中英商约之迟迟未能缔结，原因即在于此。”并说该“办法”，“其结果中国非仅拒人于外，且亦禁已于内（指影响中国出口）”。亚氏宣称：该团防华期间，“乐于与任何人士商讨中英间之问题，然无权作任何协议。”并重申英国“对远东问题之关切。”陪同亚氏出席招待会之英大使施谛则称：蒋方所提中英商约“对案”正由英国有关部门“辗转考虑中。”
    【新华社陕北五日电】南京消息：香港总督葛量宏偕其财务司长法乐士及其他顾问于一日由港飞赴南京，作对蒋政府之“正式访问”，逗留四日后，已于昨日晨飞返香港。葛氏此次“访问”目的，据中央社二十九日香港消息披露，主要为商谈“防止华南走私活动”与“改善香港与中国内地商务关系”问题，及讨论如何实施八月十五日蒋港两方在港签订之“金融经济合作协定。”但商谈之结果，对此等问题两方仍未获得协议。按蒋港“金融经济合作协定”，原为有利于美国势力借助蒋“缉私”名义伸入香港及增加蒋方美元外汇收入者，此即葛量宏声明中“此一协定对中国（指蒋政府）甚为有利”一语实际所指。协定自在美国压力下签订以来，几遭顿挫。协定全文原定八月二十三日公布，继因英方之“请求”乃行“延缓”。此后蒋港两方关于此事之谈判一直未曾中断，八月二十七日葛量宏之赴广州，九月初孙科之逗留香港，显皆与此有关。
