Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 21st: Correspondent Lan Yu reported on the Southwest Qingjian Blocking Battle, stating: As Qingjian was in distress, Liu Kan hastily led the First Division and five or six brigades of the Ninetieth Division from Yan'an to provide reinforcements, sternly ordering each unit to "advance bravely, regardless of sacrifice, to accomplish the mission of rescuing friendly forces." His telegraph numbered 609 even stipulated that "(1) units achieving reinforcement will receive double rewards based on their combat achievements at the time; (2) reinforcing units that allow friendly forces to fall into unfavorable situations due to hesitation will be punished according to the 'Bandit Suppression Handbook' through joint liability." However, this "mobile force" of Hu Zongnan had long been demoralized and fearful in the various battles in northern Shaanxi. Under the blocking actions of a small number of People's Liberation Army troops, they were apprehensive and walked on eggshells, with no one daring to risk rash advances. On the 7th, when Liu Kan supervised his troops departing from Qinghuabian, a unit of the People's Liberation Army advanced parallel to them and preemptively occupied the Caishenmiao position, more than twenty li north of Qinghuabian, bringing its firepower to bear. The enemy was caught off guard by the sudden interception and fell into disarray. Liu Kan had planned to arrive in Qingjian on the 9th, but that day he was stuck circling around Yongping. The enemy's four-column advance along the highway only progressed thirty li in one day. On the 10th, the enemy still attempted to advance along the highway towards Qusijiao Village, but a unit of the People's Liberation Army had already preemptively occupied Shicun, five li from the village, blocking their path. The enemy's vanguard regiment fought from 3 p.m. until dark but still could not break through. After halting for half a day, the enemy's follow-up troops had no choice but to change their route, leaving the highway and delving into the rugged mountains north of Shicun to find a way through. The journey Liu Kan had estimated would take two days took him until the fourth day to finally reach a point thirty li southwest of Qingjian, but he was once again blocked by a unit of the People's Liberation Army. The enemy's five or six brigades were all crowded into a narrow mountain range twenty li long from Huanjiahe to Liujiahe. Their vanguard troops unleashed all their artillery fire, trying to reach the Qingjian city that was in sight but unattainable, while the follow-up troops were exhausted, collapsing and lying haphazardly on the hillsides, panting and sunbathing. At this time, the more than four thousand Chiang bandits and local bullies led by Liao Ang inside Qingjian city, who were dreaming of "reinforcements" arriving, had all surrendered.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 22nd: According to soldiers from the Chiang army's First Brigade of the First Division, the Forty-seventh Brigade of the Twenty-seventh Division, and the Sixty-first Brigade of the Ninetieth Division, who were captured in the Southwest Qingjian Blocking Battle: This time, Liu Kan led his troops in a hasty rescue of Qingjian and suffered successive blocking attacks from the People's Liberation Army along the way, leaving them battered and exhausted. Not only were they unable to rescue their "friendly forces," but their own troops also experienced the "three great hardships" of "the hardship of running, the hardship of hunger, and the hardship of cold." The Forty-seventh Brigade was originally scheduled to return to southern Shaanxi to guard Hu Zongnan's old nest. After arriving in Ganquan and resting for only five days, they suddenly received orders to move north to reinforce Qingjian. They departed on the 7th, traveling one hundred and twenty li to Guaiwan in one day and night, eating only one meal. Before they could catch their breath, they were urged to proceed to Yongping. The First Brigade, starting from the fourth day, was both tired and hungry, traveling only fifteen li in two days and nights. Soldiers Yang Dechao from the Forty-seventh Brigade and Liu Zhongyu from the Sixty-first Brigade excitedly said, "Fortunately, we were captured and finally got a full meal." In the cold season of the northern Shaanxi plateau, the Chiang army soldiers were still wearing only thin clothes and no socks, and most of their feet were frostbitten and swollen. When they were captured, they were still draped in colorful blankets, cloth sheets, and quilts.

　　刘戡亲率匪众妄图增援清涧
  　沿路遭我军惨重打击
    没有救上廖昂反而饱吃苦头
    【新华社西北二十一日电】分社记者蓝钰报导清涧西南阻击战经过称：清涧告急，刘戡慌忙亲率第一师及九十师所属五、六个旅，由延安出援，并严令各部“应奋勇向前，不顾牺牲达成救援友军之任务”。其六零九号代电中且规定“（一）达成增援之部队即按当时之战绩加倍奖；（二）增援部队因观望致陷友军于不利者则按‘剿匪手本’中连座法议处。”可是这支胡宗南的“机动兵力”，在陕北诸役中早已被打得丧魂失魄，人人自危，在解放军少数部队的阻击下，心惊胆战，如履薄冰，谁也不敢冒险妄进。七日刘戡督军由青化砭出发时，解放军一部即与之并行前进，且抢先占领青化砭以北二十余里之财神庙阵地，施展火力。敌遭突然截击，乱成一堆。刘戡预定九日抵达清涧，但那天却陷在永坪附近团团转，敌沿公路前进的四路纵队，一天只前进了三十里。十日敌仍图沿公路向曲思教村前进，但解放军一部已先敌占领距该村五里之史村，挡住去路。敌前卫团从下午三点直打到天黑，还是通不过。敌后续部队停滞半天后，只得改变路线，离开公路，钻入史村以北的重山峻岭探寻通路。刘戡预计两天的路程，直到第四天好容易才进到清涧西南三十余里之处，但又被解放军一部阻住了去路。敌五、六个旅全部拥塞在焕家河至刘家河一线二十里之狭窄山岭地带，其前卫部队展开全部炮火猛轰想冲到可望而不可及的清涧城，而后续部队已拖得疲惫不堪，东倒西歪，横躺在山坡上喘息晒太阳。而这时清涧城内梦想“救兵”到来的廖昂以下四千余蒋匪土顽，都已个个俯首就擒了。
    【新华社西北二十二日电】据清涧西南阻击战中就俘的蒋军第一师第一旅、二十七师四十七旅及九十师六十一旅等部士兵称：这次刘戡率部仓促援救清涧，沿路遭解放军节节阻击，被打得焦头烂额，不说“友军”没有救上，自己部队可饱尝了“跑得苦、饿得苦、冻得苦”的“三大苦处”。四十七旅原定调回陕南去守胡宗南的老巢，开到甘泉刚休整五天，突然奉命又北调增援清涧；七日出发，一昼夜赶到拐弯，跑了一百二十里只吃一顿饭。喘息未定，又催着开往永坪。第一旅由第四天起拖得既累且饿，一天两夜中只走了十五里路。四十七旅士兵杨德超、六十一旅士兵刘钟毓等都兴奋地说：“幸亏当了俘虏才吃上饱饭。”在陕北高原寒冷季节里，蒋军士兵还都穿着单衣、没有袜子，大部分士兵脚都冻裂发肿。他们在被俘时，身上还披着五颜六色的毯子、布单和棉被。
