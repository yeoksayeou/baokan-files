　　Local Armed Forces in Southwestern Shandong Valiantly Attack
  　Foil Chiang Kai-shek's 5th Division's Attempt to Flee South
    Eliminating Nearly 100 Enemies and Destroying Three Vehicles Between Shanxian and Dangshan
    [Report from this newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan-Anhui Front, 19th] After the main force of the Shandong-Hebei-Henan-Anhui People's Liberation Army advanced into Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu, the enemy's 75th and 5th Divisions also fled south in a panic, and were repeatedly attacked by our local armed forces along the way, making them extremely embarrassed. On October 2nd, the enemy's 5th Division motorcade, under the cover of heavy troops, moved south along the Shanxian-Dangshan Highway. A part of our local armed forces took the opportunity to valiantly attack, intercepting and burning three enemy vehicles, capturing nine enemies including a company commander and motorcade captain, killing and wounding thirty-six enemies, and seizing seven American-style light machine guns, two submachine guns, sixteen rifles, three pistols, two pairs of binoculars, more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition, and many other military supplies such as shells. The Chengwu 6th District Working Group, in coordination with the county brigade, captured 15 enemies (including two warrant officers) in Nanluji, and also intercepted a large cart of enemy rice, military uniforms, etc. The 4th detachment intercepted a cart of enemy shells, one horse and one mule, and captured two enemies. The 8th detachment captured an enemy company commander. When the enemy's 5th Division fled south along the Shanxian-Dangshan Highway, our Hua-Dang Armed Work Team formed guerrilla groups of three to five people, inserted themselves into villages along the highway to harass the enemy and capture stragglers. They captured three enemy stragglers in Huanglou, seizing one rifle. The Zhanglou Working Group relied on tunnels to harass the enemy, also capturing one straggler. These small victories, in addition to delaying the enemy's movement and powerfully cooperating with our main force in combat, greatly boosted the fighting spirit of the local masses. Under the slogan of defending the autumn harvest and wheat planting, the local militia actively mobilized, cooperating with the local armed forces to strike at bandits and secret agents who were plundering grain everywhere. On the 7th of this month, the Jinxiang enemy county brigade, in coordination with two puppet Bao-Xiang public offices, advanced to Lizhai, west of Grain Store, to plunder grain and conscript men, disrupting the masses' wheat planting. Our Mapiao District Protection Team first bravely resisted, and our county brigade, upon hearing the news, immediately took the initiative to insert itself behind the enemy. After an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy was completely defeated, with eight enemies killed or wounded. Two carts that the enemy had looted from the masses, four sets of cotton clothes, and four quilts were recovered and immediately returned to the masses. In addition, a part of our Third Sub-district local armed forces, in coordination with the Zhao Zhuang Guo Tang District militia, attacked the Zhao Zhuang Ji pseudo-township public office on the night of September 27, annihilating most of the puppet bandits, capturing one pseudo-township head, four Bao chiefs, and more than 100 "Homecoming Corps" members, seizing one Mauser pistol, nine rifles, two bicycles, and some ammunition.
