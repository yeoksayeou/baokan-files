Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 5th: Our army, advancing into southern Shaanxi, liberated Shangnan County on the 3rd at 1:00 AM after capturing Long. The defending enemy fled in panic, and we captured more than 30 prisoners and seized a large amount of supplies. This city is an important town in southern Shaanxi, located on the vital Xi'an-Jingzi highway, guarding the throat of Hubei and Shaanxi. As Hu Zongnan is being battered by our army and fleeing in disarray, the Liberation Army's wedge into the Hu bandit's flank, backed by the Funiu Mountains and facing Hanzhong, forms a mutual strategic position with the Liberation Army advancing into Hanzhong, echoing each other from afar. This will cause the Hu bandits to suffer setbacks on both sides and be unable to attend to both ends.
    Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan Front, 5th: The Liberation Army pursued and routed the enemy scattered at Xiaodian, Yiyang, annihilating two companies of the enemy's 51st Division and occupying villages such as Yushuyuan. After being severely attacked by our army in Xiaodian, Yiyang, on the 29th, Chiang bandit's 13th Brigade, 51st Regiment, and a regiment of the Youth Army fled in a northeast direction. Our army pursued and dealt them a heavy blow in the area north of Linru Town at 1:00 PM on the 2nd, annihilating part of them.

　　陕南续克商南
  　胡匪老巢背腹受威胁
    【新华社豫西前线五日电】挺进陕南我军，继克龙之后复于三日一时解放商南县城。守敌仓惶逃窜，被我生俘三十余人，缴获甚多。按该城为陕南重镇，地当西（安）荆（紫）公路要冲，扼住鄂陕咽喉。正值胡宗南正遭军击，狼奔豕突之际，解放大军目此楔入胡匪侧翼，背依伏牛，面对汉中，且与挺进汉中之解放军互为犄角，遥相呼应。将使胡匪腹背受挫，首尾不能相顾。
    【新华社豫西前线五日电】解放大军追击伊阳小店溃散，歼灭敌五十一师之两个连，并占领榆树园等村。蒋匪十三旅五十一团及青年军一个团，二十九日在伊阳小店被我痛击后，即向东北方向溃逃，我军尾追，于二日下午一时在临汝镇以北地区予以痛击，歼灭其一部。
