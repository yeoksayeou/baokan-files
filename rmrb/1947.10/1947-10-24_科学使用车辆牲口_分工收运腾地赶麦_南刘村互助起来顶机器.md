　　Scientific Use of Vehicles and Livestock
  　Division of Labor for Harvesting and Transportation, Clearing Land for Wheat Planting
  　Nanliu Village Cooperates to Replace Machines
    [This Dispatch from Jinan, Hebei, 22nd] After solving the difficulties of vehicles and livestock in the cooperative wheat planting in Nanliu Village, Qiuxian County, autumn harvesting, wheat planting, and threshing were not delayed, and two more qing of wheat were planted. The village only had two large carts, which made them feel very difficult during the autumn harvest and wheat planting. They unified the use of the carts, using them day and night, going to deliver fertilizer and returning to pull crops, to be fast and save labor. Labor hero Yuan Zhaolin's group harnessed the cart to pull fertilizer after dinner (two cows and six people working together), and finished pulling eleven carts of fertilizer before midnight, equaling one and a half days of work. Dong Huiwen's group pulled fertilizer from the fifth watch (around 3-5 AM), and pulled twelve carts of fertilizer by dawn, and also brought back twelve carts of crops, solving the difficulty of the lack of large carts. Secondly, the difficulty of animal power was solved. Large cattle were exchanged for small cattle, and the groups adjusted and used them mutually. Large cattle are slow but have strength, suitable for pulling fertilizer and plowing the land. Large cattle can plow one mu more land per half-day than small cattle (large cattle can plow three mu per half-day, small cattle can plow two mu), small cattle are faster and have less strength, when planting, small cattle can plant two mu more land per half-day than large cattle (small cattle can plant ten mu per half-day, large cattle plant eight mu). According to the above situation, each group proposed exchanging cattle according to the size and weight of the work. Li Xuecheng and Yuan Zhaolin exchanged cattle. Zhaolin's cattle were large, and he plowed one mu more land for Xuecheng in half a day. When it was overcast and rainy, Zhaolin used Xuecheng's small cattle to grind flour, grinding one small dou more grain per half-day (large cattle only grind two small dou per half-day). With this method, the labor rate was strengthened, and wheat planting, autumn harvest, and threshing were not delayed. Because of the heavy rain this autumn, the crops that had been harvested in the fields were afraid of being damaged by the rain, so it was necessary to seize the opportunity to thresh. Therefore, the whole village implemented a division of labor, with able-bodied men concentrating their efforts on rushing to plant and harvest; semi-able-bodied laborers picked cotton, shaved grain ears, and threshed at home. Because of the good coordination and the proper use of labor, all the crops in Nanliu Village, except for peanuts, cotton, and sweet potatoes, have now been harvested and threshed, and the wheat fields have also been cleared. The village originally planned to plant six qing of wheat, but now they have planted eight qing. If it doesn't rain anymore, two more qing can be planted in the low-lying areas, reaching a huge quantity of ten qing of land. Everyone saw this situation and felt the benefits of mutual assistance. If there was no mutual assistance, with so few agricultural implements and only two large carts, there would be no way to cultivate eight qing of wheat land. Labor hero Li Xuekui said: "This is what it means to cooperate and replace machines!"

  　分工收运腾地赶麦
  　南刘村互助起来顶机器
    【本报冀南二十二日电】邱县南刘村互助种麦，大车牲口等困难得到解决后，收秋种麦打场三不误，多种了麦子两顷。该村仅有两辆大车，秋收种麦中很感困难，他们便把大车统一使用，昼夜不闲，去时送粪回来拉庄稼，来回送的办法，做到又快又省工。劳动英雄袁兆林组吃罢晚饭套车拉粪（二头牛和六个人一齐上），不到半夜就拉完了十一车粪，顶白天一晌半。董会文组起五更拉粪，到天明就拉了十二车粪，回来又捎了十二车庄稼，解决了大车缺乏的困难。其次是解决了畜力困难，大牛换小牛，各组互相调剂使用，大牛慢有劲，适合拉粪犁地，大牛一晌比小牛多犁一亩地（大牛一晌能犁三亩，小牛犁二亩），小牛较快劲头小，耩地时，小牛比大牛一晌能多耩二亩地（小牛一晌耩十亩，大牛耩八亩）。各组根据以上情形，提出根据活的大小轻重，互相换牛使用。李学成与袁兆林换牛，兆林的牛大，一晌给学成多犁了一亩地，阴天下雨时，兆林使用学成小牛推磨，一晌多磨了一小斗粮食（大牛一晌只磨二小斗）。用这样的办法，加强劳动速率，做到种麦、秋收、打场三不误。因今秋雨多，怕已收到场里的庄稼被雨淋坏了，必须抓紧时机打场，于是全村实行分工，男整劳力集中力量抢种、抢收；半劳力在家拾花、削谷穗、打场。因配合的好，劳力运用得当，南刘村除了落花生、棉花、红薯外，其他庄稼现都收净，打完了场，麦地也都已腾好了。该村原计划种六顷麦，现已种了八顷。如再不下雨，凹地还能种二顷，即达到十顷地的巨大数量。大家看到这种情况，都感觉到互助的好处，如果不互助，农具这样少、大车只二辆，啥法也弄不出八顷麦地。劳英李学魁说：“这才是互助起来能顶机器哩！”
