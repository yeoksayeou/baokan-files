　　Women Send Husbands to Counter-Attack, Voluntarily Enrolling as Militia

　　[This Newspaper News] Jin Yuying and Wang Yulan, two women from Zhaibuchang, Bo'ai, were originally extremely poor. They were emancipated when the Eighth Route Army first liberated Bo'ai. Last year, after the Chiang bandit landlords invaded Bo'ai, their legitimate struggle fruits were completely reversed. They suffered great oppression and could barely survive. After this liberation, they said, "Poor people have seen the light of day again, have been emancipated again, have food to eat, clothes to wear, and land to cultivate. The landlords and despots have been eliminated, our anger has been vented, and our grievances have been aired. It is Chairman Mao and the Communist Party who led us to be emancipated. We must protect the fruits of our emancipation struggle, protect our country. We voluntarily signed up to join the militia." Under their leadership, five more young women voluntarily signed up to join the militia. The women in the first district sent their husbands to join the army, and they themselves signed up to join the militia. Bi Shu from Fifth Street said when sending her husband to join the army, "Go and join the army to fight Chiang Kai-shek! I will join the militia in the rear to protect our country." Ninety-nine women in the entire district have joined the militia. Zhang Xiulian, a woman from Sanyi Township in the first district, voluntarily sent her husband, Shuangshan, to join the army. She said, "I cannot join the army, so I will send my husband to protect everyone. I will also join the militia. My husband is killing the enemy on the front lines, and I am leading the emancipation in the village. After we defeat Chiang Kai-shek, husband and wife will be reunited."
