"I'll get you some steamed buns!"
  A Story of How the Child Miao Deqiu Cleverly Captured the Enemy
    Ping Yuan
    When our Chen-Su Army captured Cao County, the enemy's defeated soldiers scattered and fled everywhere. The Qi Bin militia captured enemy soldiers everywhere, and the people also helped them shout:
　“Hey, don't let them run away, don't let them run away!”……
    Miao Deqiu from Miao Village was only thirteen years old. He was watching the millet in the field when four scattered enemy soldiers, not far from the edge of the field, sneaked into the millet field, looking around with mournful faces, trying to find a chance to escape.
    At this moment, someone outside was shouting, "Don't let them run away!" Deqiu had already seen those four guys, but he felt he was too small, and it wouldn't be easy to capture four enemies. What should he do? He finally came up with a plan. He ran up to the enemies and said with a smile:
    "Old General, are you hungry? I'll get you some steamed buns. Would you like a drink? I'll fetch you some water."
    The enemy said, "Go get them, we haven't eaten for a whole day and night! We've been chased by the *Tu Balu* and haven't eaten for a whole day and night."
    When Miao Deqiu heard the enemy's words, he was both happy and anxious. He ran back to Miao Village in a big hurry and found the head of the farmers' association at his home, and said breathlessly:
    "Head of the association, quickly..."
    "What's wrong! Er Xiao, look at your excitement, you can't even speak!"
    "Quickly call people to go, four damned soldiers are waiting in the field!"
    "Where are they, Er Xiao, tell me quickly!" The head of the farmers' association was beaming:
    "In the Zheng Nan millet field!" Deqiu pointed with his finger. As soon as the head of the farmers' association heard this, he didn't bother to ask for details. He immediately gathered more than twenty people and set off with rifles and homemade guns.
    "Head of the association, it's still far away, I'll lead you there!"
    Deqiu led everyone and quickly surrounded that millet field.
    "Damn it, don't you hurry up and hand over your guns!" The militiamen twisted their guns and fired a few shots, bang bang. The four enemies knew that the militia had arrived, and they were so scared that they peed their pants. They knelt on the ground, holding their guns with both hands, wearing their hats askew, and shouted: "Sir, I... surrender... my guns!"... The militiamen confiscated four rifles and one pistol, and escorted the four prisoners. Deqiu followed them happily back.

*Tu Balu* was a derogatory term used by the Nationalists to describe the Communist Eighth Route Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

　　“给你拿馍馍去！”
  　儿童苗德秋巧计捉敌记
    平远
    当我陈粟大军攻克曹县时，敌人的残兵败将四处逃窜，齐滨民兵到处捕捉敌兵，老百姓也帮着他们叫喊：
　“吓，不让他们跑了，不让他们跑了！”……
    苗庄苗德秋才十三岁，正在地里看谷子，四个敌人的散兵，在离地不远的地方，偷偷的钻到谷地里，哭丧着脸，东张西望，企图找个空子逃走。
    这时外边正有人叫：“可别叫他们跑了！”德秋早已看见了那四个家伙，可是他又觉的自己太小，捉四个敌人可不容易，怎么办呢？他终于想出了一个办法，跑到敌人跟前去满带着笑容的说：
    “老总，您饿不，我给您拿馍去，您喝，我给您端水。”
    敌人说：“拿去吧，俺一天一夜没吃啦！叫土八路撵俺饿了一天一夜了。”
    苗德秋听了敌人的话，心里又喜又急，大步小跑的回了苗庄，找到农会长家里，气喘喘的说：
    “农会长，快……”
    “干啥啦！二小，看你那个劲头，话也说不上来啦！”
    “快叫人去吧，四个遭殃军在地里等着哩！”
    “那里呀，二小，快给我说！”农会长眉飞色舞了：
    “正南谷地里！”德秋用手指着。农会长一听也顾不得详细问了，马上集合了二十多个人，扛着钢枪和土枪出发了。
    “农会长，还远哩，我领着您去！”
    德秋领着大家，把那块谷地神速的围起来了。
    “他妈的，还不赶快交枪！”民兵们把枪一扭，砰砰的打了几枪。四个敌人知道是民兵上来了，吓得屁滚尿流，跪在地上，两手托着枪，歪戴着帽子高喊：“老爷，我……交……枪！”……民兵们缴了四支步枪一支匣枪，押着四个俘虏，德秋跟着他们高高兴兴的回来了。
