The Taiwanese Brothers Being Strangled
    Méi Cūn
    Xie Shuixiu, Huang Qingwang, and Liu Yicheng are all from Hsinchu County, Taiwan. Last year, after Chen Yi went to Taiwan, they were tricked into joining the 70th Division, 107th Brigade (later renamed 140th Brigade), 180th Regiment, and 127th Regiment as soldiers. They were liberated during the Jin Yu battle in January this year. The following is a record of their grievances.

    "...What Use Are Pigs?!"
    Before the Japanese devils surrendered, they seized the food of every family in Taiwan and stored it, preparing for a long-term war. According to insiders, "The food stored by the Japanese devils is enough for 200,000 people to eat for five years!"
    After the Japanese devils surrendered, Chiang Kai-shek's running dog, Chen Yi, went to Taiwan and first "took over" the food stored by the Japanese devils, transported it, and sold it to the Japanese, engaging in speculative business and making a fortune. Then, he went from Bao to Jia, door to door, demanding food and money. Those who couldn't afford it were tied up, hung, beaten, and fined! The Taiwanese compatriots, who had been half-killed by the Japanese devils, not only did not receive any relief but were forced to live in a state worse than death.
    Therefore, the Taiwanese compatriots composed a folk song and gave it to the Chiang family court: "Dogs can guard the door, pigs only eat; dogs can guard the door, what use are pigs?!" (Note: Dogs refer to the Japanese, and pigs are compared to Chiang's officials).

    Fooled
    When people were starving and unable to survive, the Chiang family authorities raised the banner of recruiting soldiers.
    Their deceptive slogans were: "Serve the motherland, defend Taiwan...; 3,000 yuan (Taiwan dollars) salary per month as a soldier; return home after two years; after returning home, all living expenses will be subsidized by the government; one day off per week, everyone can go home to see;...study every day; guaranteed superior living conditions...etc."
    Some young people, on the one hand, felt it was glorious to "defend Taiwan..."; on the other hand, they were lured by material benefits and signed up to be soldiers.

    "...It's Not Like That At All!"
    After we joined the 70th Division, 107th Brigade (before the reorganization), the material treatment was not like that at all. Monthly salary: 200 yuan for upper class soldier; 160 yuan for first class soldier; 130 yuan for second class soldier. Two meals of coarse rice a day, eating it felt like swallowing chaff. The food allowance, in name, was ten yuan per person per day - at this amount, it would be enough to eat pork. But in fact, we could only eat "boiled radish strips in clear water" every day, without a trace of oil, bland and tasteless. We were never full. Where did the food allowance go? The officials embezzled it. As for studying and taking vacations, it was all lies. During the day, every move was watched by veteran soldiers, and at night we were locked in a small room, with a guard standing outside the door, and we didn't even have the freedom to relieve ourselves...

    "...Had to Suck Up to the Squad Leader"
    There was no emotion between the soldiers and the officers. The soldiers regarded the officers as King Yama, not daring to look them in the eye. Seeing their faces was like a mouse seeing a cat. The officers often beat and scolded the soldiers. Not to mention the big officers, even a small-dick squad leader would beat soldiers as a matter of routine. If you sucked up to him, he would treat you a little better. If you didn't suck up to him, he would just find fault with you. Therefore, everyone had to suck up to him. At mealtimes, we would compete to serve him rice; when washing his face, we would compete to pour him water; when marching and camping, we would compete to get him bath water and foot washing water; when he took off his dirty clothes, we would compete to wash them for him... It's not that we soldiers were willing to serve people. In such an army, what could you do if you didn't do this?...

    Desertion Became a Trend
    Soon, the team moved from Hsinchu County to Keelung County. The superiors didn't tell us where we were going or what we were going to do. After arriving in Keelung, we heard that we were going to be transferred to the mainland. We speculated about what we would do on the mainland: It wouldn't be anything good!
    The trend of desertion became even more fierce when moving from Keelung to the mainland. Some jumped off the train while sitting on the train; some jumped off the car while sitting in the car; some fell to their deaths! Those who didn't die ran for their lives; those who were on the ship jumped into the sea, simply drowning themselves... Drowning was better than serving Chiang Kai-shek!
    In order to prevent escape, on the train, the company commander, platoon leader, and squad leader guarded the door and windows; in the car, officers and veteran soldiers sat around, encircling the Taiwanese soldiers; on the ship, machine guns were set up at both ends...
    Those who were caught after running away were sometimes shot; some were buried alive; some were beaten to death with sticks; some were beaten half to death. After a soldier from the third battalion of the 180th Regiment deserted and was caught, the entire company was assembled, his clothes were stripped off, he was pressed to the ground, and everyone beat him three times, knocking the flesh off his buttocks, exposing the bones. Before the whole company had finished beating him once, he died... Originally, we were all brothers with the same fate. Who would want to beat him? But what could you do if you didn't beat him?! If you beat him lightly, the officers would say that you were of one mind with him and also wanted to run away, and would immediately press you down and beat you up!...
    Even so, it still couldn't stop the large-scale escape. On the road from Keelung to Shanghai, more than half of the sixth company of the third battalion of the 187th Regiment ran away, more than 30 soldiers from the third company of the third battalion of the 180th Regiment ran away, and two-fifths of the first company of the first battalion also ran away...

　　被绞杀着的台湾兄弟
    梅村
    谢水秀、黄清旺、刘益程，都是台湾新竹县人。去年，陈仪到台湾后，他们被骗参加七十师一○七旅（后改一四○旅）一八○团，及一二七团当兵，今年一月金鱼战役中，被解放过来。现在军大学习。下面是他们诉苦的纪录。
    “……猪来何用！？”
    日寇没投降前，在台湾，把每一家老百姓的粮食，都抢了去，储藏起来，准备长期作战用。据了解内情的人传说：“日寇储藏的粮食，足够二十万人吃五年！”
    日寇投降，蒋介石的走狗陈仪去到台湾，首先把日寇储藏的粮食“接收”过去，运去卖给了日本人，作了投机生意，发了洋财。接着，又挨保挨甲，挨门挨户，要粮食，要款子，出不起，就捆起来，吊、打、罚！被日寇压榨得半死的台湾同胞，不但没得到丝毫救济，反而被逼得死活不得。
    所以，台湾同胞就编了一首歌谣，赠给蒋家朝廷：“狗可守门，猪一味吃；狗可守门，猪来何用！？”（按：狗系指日本人，猪比作蒋家官吏）。
    上当
    人们正在饥饿中，无法活下去的时候，蒋家当局揭出招兵旗帜，招兵了。
    他们的欺骗口号是：“为祖国服务，保卫台湾……；当了兵一月三千元（台币）薪饷；两年期满回家；回家后，一切生活费用，统由公家优待；一礼拜放假一次，大家可回家看看；……每天读书；生活保证优裕，……等等。”
    一些青年人，一方面觉得“为了保卫台湾……”是光荣的；另方面受了物质待遇的诱惑，就报名当了兵。
    “……完全不是那末回事！”
    我们参加七十师，一百零七旅（整编前）后，物质待遇，完全不是那末回事。每月薪饷：上等兵，二百元；一等兵一百六十元；二等兵一百三十元。一天两顿糙米饭，吃起来，像吞糠一样。菜金名义上，是每人一天十块——按这个数目，光吃猪肉也够了。而事实上，每天只能吃到“清水煮萝卜条”，看不见一星油，淡而无味。顿顿吃不饱。菜金那去了？当官的贪污了。至于念书、放假，完全是骗人。白天一举一动，都被老兵监视着，夜晚关在一间小屋里，门外站上岗，连出大小便的自由也没有……。
    “……不得不巴结班长”
    当兵的和当官的没一点感情。当兵的把官长看做阎王爷，不敢正视他一眼。见他的面，就像老鼠见了猫。当官的，动不动就打骂当兵的。不要说大官，就是个小鸡巴班长，打兵也是家常便饭。你要巴结他，他对你还稍微好一些，你要不巴结他，他就光找你的岔子。因此，谁都不得不巴结他。吃饭时候，争着给他盛饭；洗脸时候，争着给他倒洗脸水；行军宿营，争着给他打洗澡水，洗脚水；脏衣服脱下来，争着给他洗衣服……。并不是我们当兵的甘愿侍候人，在那样的军队里，你不这样作有什么办法呢？……
    开小差成了风气
    不久，队伍从新竹县往基隆县开了，上面也不告诉我们上那去，干什么？等到基隆后，才听说要调到国内去，到国内干什么，我们推猜：反正没好事！
    开小差的风气，从基隆往国内走时，更加凶了。坐在火车上，跳火车；坐在汽车上，跳汽车；有的跳下去，摔死了！没死的，就拼命跑；坐在轮船上，就跳船，干脆跳到海里淹死……淹死也比为蒋介石服务强！
    为了防止逃亡。在火车上，连长、排长、班长，把住门口，守住窗子；在汽车上，军官和老兵坐在周围，把台湾兵圈在中间；在轮船上，两头架上机关枪……。
    逃跑被捉回来，有的枪毙了；有的活埋了；有的活活用棍子打死了；有的被打得半死。一八○团三营一个兵，开小差被抓回后，全连集合，把他衣服剥光，按倒在地，每人打三棍，把他屁股上的肉都打掉了，露出骨头，没等全连人打够一遍，就断了气……本来都是同命兄弟，谁愿意打他？但是，不打怎么行？！你打的轻了，当官的还说你和他一心，也想逃跑，马上按倒，揍你一顿！……
    就这样，仍制止不住大批的逃亡。从基隆到上海的路上，一八七团三营六连，跑了一多半，一八○团三营三连，跑了三十多名，一营一连，还跑了五分之二……。
