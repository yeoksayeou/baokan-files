　　Washing Bastards in the Clear Water River
　　Cao Xin
　　In the former Kang prisoner of war camp, there was a captured military officer named Zhao Gaizheng. He did not cherish the leniency and freedom given to him by the people of the liberated areas. He still firmly believed in everything Chiang Kai-shek taught him: as long as you have money, you can do anything.
　　One day, after eating the millet grown with the blood and sweat of the people, instead of reflecting on his past crimes of oppression against the people, he patted the banknotes in his pocket, attempting to go out and seduce women.
　　Women who grow up in a new democratic society are not to be bullied. They have truly gained liberation, and they all know how to respect themselves.
　　At that time, he was severely rejected by the woman he harassed, and the woman immediately reported to her organization, the "Women's Association." The "Women's Association," through the village cadres, immediately convened a mass meeting of the whole village and invited all the prisoners to participate, to reason with him and severely educate him.
　　At the meeting, another liberated officer listened for a long time, spat, and said fiercely to Zhao Gaizheng: "In the past, we were confused bastards, because everyone there was a confused bastard, so it didn't stand out. Now that you've come to the Clear Water River, you should wash away this stink and change your ways to be a good person! Continuing to be a confused bastard in the Clear Water River will be seen through at a glance.”
　　Indeed, facts prove that those who are so confused are precisely the disciples and grandchildren of Chiang Kai-shek, and they are not allowed to exist in our liberated area, this Clear Water River.

　　清水河里洗混蛋
    曹欣
    在原康俘虏收容所里，有一个俘虏军官，名叫赵改正，他不懂得珍爱解放区人民对他的宽大和给他的自由，而仍然深信蒋介石教导他的一切：只要有钱，什么都能办到。
    一天，他吃饱了人民用血汗种植出来的小米之后，不好好反省自己过去对人民种种欺压的罪行，却拍打着他口袋里的钞票，企图出去诱惑女性了。
    在新民主主义社会里生长起来的女性，不是好欺侮的，她们真正得到了解放，她们都懂得尊重自己。
    当时，他便遭到那个被调戏的妇女的严厉拒绝，而且那个妇女马上去报告了自己的组织“妇女会”。“妇女会”通过了村干部，立即召集了全村的群众大会，并请所有俘虏参加，来给他说理，严厉地教育他。
    在会上，另一个被解放的军官听了半天，吐了一口唾沫，狠狠地对着赵改正说：“过去我们混帐王八蛋，因为我们那里人都混帐王八蛋，所以显不出来。如今到了清水河边上了，你应该洗洗这身臭气，改头换面作个好人！在清水河里还要混帐忘八蛋，是马上会被人家一眼看到底的。”
    的确，事实证明，那样混帐的正是蒋介石的徒子徒孙，而在我们解放区这一条清水河里是不允许他们存在的。
