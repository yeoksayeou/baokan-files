　　A Village in the Jilu Yu Guerrilla Area
  　Recognizes the Victorious Situation
  　Actively Demands Land Distribution
    [Jilu Yu News, 18th of This Month] The masses in the guerrilla area, recognizing the current situation of the great counter-offensive, have actively risen up to demand land distribution. ×× Village, in the first district of Linze, is carrying out a review of land reform. Because it is constantly in a guerrilla and turbulent environment, the land reform in some villages is very incomplete. The struggles in the past were mostly false. Landlords casually took out some inferior or remote land and gave it to the masses, while keeping the good and nearby land for themselves, or giving it to their close relatives. The reform was superficial, and secretly, rent was still paid to the landlords. In the past, the masses did not understand the situation and were hesitant, so they did not dare to openly propose the idea of ​​distributing land or reasonably distributing land. Since the Liu-Deng army fought to the Yangtze River and the national counter-offensive began, the masses have recognized the counter-offensive situation and know that Old Chiang will be finished sooner or later. Even if there is a tug-of-war again, he (referring to the Chiang bandits) will not occupy it for long, so ideological concerns have been reduced. The county government work team understood the masses' demands for land distribution and went deep into the village to specifically help the masses reasonably distribute the land. There are a total of seventy households in the village, with eight landlord and rich peasant families, forty-seven poor peasant families, and the rest are middle peasants. In the past, landlords, rich peasants, and hooligans were in power, controlling the village administration. They once took out a portion of the worst land and gave it to the masses. When the district asked them if they had distributed the land, they replied: "We did." After the work team arrived in the village, they brought out the burden registers of other villages, and statistically calculated the land area ratio of landlords and poor peasants. All were calculated according to standard land. Landlords each had more than 1.5 mu of land, while poor peasants had a total of 0.2 mu. Immediately, a poor peasant association was convened, and the masses complained: "I have participated in the peasant association for several years, but I haven't received anything. The things that were fought for were all eaten and drunk by the chairman. In the past, the landlord was the chairman, and later he was replaced by a landlord's lackey hooligan; at that time, when things were distributed, we didn't dare to be in charge, we couldn't get involved, and the land that was distributed was broken land that didn't grow crops." Everyone actively demanded a reasonable distribution of land. On the spot, the masses elected their own evaluation committee members to preside over the land distribution. When distributing the land, the landlords were also called to the venue to face the demands. Everyone picked the good land they wanted, and gave the worst land to the landlords. In the past, the landlords gave good land to their close relatives, and according to the situation, it was also reasonably exchanged. In the exchange of land, there was such a problem: the inferior land that the landlords gave to the masses in the past, because the masses cultivated diligently and applied more fertilizer, this year's crops grew even better than the landlords' good land, so everyone decided that the exchange of land would not include the exchange of crops. In the past, the entire village of masses had distributed a total of 20 mu of landlord land. After this review, 60 mu (standard land) were distributed. Now the village's peasant association has been restored, and the membership has expanded to fifty.

　　冀鲁豫游击区某村
  　认清胜利形势
  　积极要求分田
    【本报冀鲁豫十八日电】游击区群众认识了目前大反攻形势，积极起来要求分土地。临泽一区××庄，展开土改复查，由于经常处在游击动荡的环境中，某些村庄的土地改革很不彻底，过去的斗争半是假的，地主随便拿出一部分孬地或远地给了群众，好地近地，一部自己留下，一部分给自己的近门子，明改暗不改，暗地里仍给地主交租。群众过去因对时局不摸底，思想上有愿意，所以不敢公开提出要分地或合理分地的意见。从刘、邓大军打到长江，全国大反攻开始后，群众认识了反攻形势，知道老蒋早晚得完蛋，就算再拉锯，他（指蒋匪）也不会占长，因此思想上减少了顾虑，县府工作组了解了群众的分地要求，即深入到庄，具体帮助群众合理的分配土地，该庄一共七十户人家，地主和富农有八家，贫农有四十七家，其他为中农，过去是地主富农流氓当道，掌握村政权，曾把最孬的地拿出来一部分给群众。区里问他们分地了没有，他们回答说：“分了”，工作组到该庄后，搬出来他村的负担册子，统计了一下地主与贫农的地亩比例数，统统按标准地算，地主每人合地一亩半以上，贫农共合二分地。当即召开了贫农会，群众诉苦说：“参加了几年农会啦，没有分到一点东西，斗的东西都叫会长吃喝了。以前是地主当会长，后来又换了个地主狗腿流氓；那时候分东西，咱不敢当家，插不上手，分给了点地也是破地，不长庄稼。”大家纷纷要求合理的分配土地。当场群众选出了自己的评议委员，主持分地。分地时把地主也叫到会场上，对面要地，大家拣那块好要那块，把最坏的地给地主。过去地主把好地给了近门子，根据情形也合理的换过来。在换地中，有这样的问题：以前地主给群众的孬地，由于群众勤耕锄多上粪，今年的庄稼长的比地主的好地还好，所以大家决定了换地不换庄稼。过去，全村群众共分地主土地二十亩，这次复查后分得了六十亩（标准地）。现在村的农会恢复起来了，会员扩大到五十名。
