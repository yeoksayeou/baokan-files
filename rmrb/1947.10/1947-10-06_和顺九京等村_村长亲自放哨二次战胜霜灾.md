He Shun, Jiu Jing and Other Villages
　Village Chief Personally Stands Guard, Twice Victorious Against Frost Damage
　　[Our He Shun Dispatch] Under the leadership of the Frost Prevention Command of the Fourth District of Qingcheng, scouting for frost prevention, and preparing sentry squads and firewood were all done in advance. On the night before White Dew, at dawn, a burst of bugle calls, and more than one hundred emancipated farmers from the whole village rushed to the frost prevention area. Fires started everywhere, with dense smoke connecting together, like clouds and mist covering the sky, resisting the severe frost. When dawn broke, and they looked at the areas that had not been able to avoid frost in the past (where there were no fire platforms and the smoke didn't reach), there was frost. The masses all happily said, "Frost prevention can indeed conquer nature, otherwise the crops would have been killed by the frost." In Jiu Jing Village, Second District, under the leadership of Village Chief Li Baolong, more than two thousand mu of autumn seedlings were saved in the whole village. A total of twenty-seven fire platforms were set up in the whole village, each with six large loads of firewood. On the second day of the eighth lunar month, the weather was bad, and the village chief led the militia to stay up all night. On the third day, they persevered for another day, and when it was almost dawn at the fifth watch, they fired cannons and lit the fires. As a result, when they looked at it at dawn, the crops in Jiu Jing Village were not even killed in the leaves, as if there had been no frost at all. Everyone was happy and said, "Our village chief is really serving the masses." In Hebei, the Taocun cadres did not personally lead the sentry duty, and did not even come out to see from home. When they heard the cannons being fired in Jiu Jing, they ignored it, and only lit the fires when it was almost dawn, and frost had already formed, and the buckwheat and corn were also killed by the frost. Like Dongguan, they did a very good job in frost prevention, and have conquered nature several times in a row.

　　和顺九京等村
  　村长亲自放哨二次战胜霜灾
    【本报和顺讯】四区青城在防霜指挥部的领导下，侦察防霜，放哨小组柴火等事先就有了准备。在白露前一天晚上，黎明一阵号声，全村一百多翻身农民涌上防霜区，四处火起，浓烟相接，如云雾遮天，抵抗了严霜，天明看时，过去不好停霜的地区（没焚火台烟未到），有了霜，群众都笑喜喜的说：“防霜就是能战胜天，不然庄稼就要霜死哩。”二区九京村在村长李宝龙的领导下，全村秋苗二千余亩救活，全村共设了二十七个焚火台，每台有六大担柴，在阴历八月初二日，天气不好，村长就带领民兵一夜不睡，初三日又坚持一天，到五更时就打炮点火，结果天明一看，九京村的庄稼都连叶子也没死了，就象是没有下霜的样子，人人高兴，都说：“咱这村长真是为群众服务哩。”河北桃村干部不亲自领导站岗，在家也不出来看，九京打了炮听见也不理，天快明才点火，结下了霜，荞麦玉茭也都霜死。如东关在防霜上做的很好，连霜几次都战胜了天。
