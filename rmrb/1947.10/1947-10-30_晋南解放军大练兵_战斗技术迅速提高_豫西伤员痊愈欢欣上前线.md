　　Jinnan People's Liberation Army Conducts Large-Scale Military Training
  　Combat Skills Rapidly Improve
  　Convalescing Wounded Soldiers in Western Henan Cheerfully Return to the Front Lines
    [This Dispatch from Our Taiyue Correspondent, 28th] The Jinnan People's Liberation Army is universally engaged in a "sharpening the blade" training upsurge at the front lines. Their slogan is: "Sharpen the blade that isn't sharp enough." Each battalion of the Zhongtiao Detachment and each artillery company are learning from each other and exchanging experiences in a competitive spirit. They have mastered four major skills in five days: (1) Constructing fortifications. Twelve people can complete one in four hours. (2) Aiming and firing within fortifications. The artillery company of the Third Battalion can hit three out of four shots. The artillery of the First Battalion fired at a pile of earth 800 meters away, hitting five out of eight shots. (3) They can fire in unison under unified command and at unified targets. (4) Manufacturing primers using discarded bullets. Duan Fuxiang, a platoon leader of the Sixth Company of a certain unit, and Wang Renyi, carried a 250-jin ladder across a springboard twice, covering a distance of 400 meters each way in the "sharpening the blade" process. Comrade Lang Shan of the Fifth Company of the Fourth Battalion of the Jinnan Detachment said, "Seize the time to train the new recruits well, so they can be as useful as veteran soldiers in combat." Therefore, whenever he has time, he takes the entire squad to train near the fortifications. At the same time, he also educates the new soldiers in the essentials of aiming and firing within the fortifications, never letting time pass in vain.
    [This Dispatch from Our Taiyue Correspondent, 28th] Sixty-five wounded soldiers of the Western Henan People's Liberation Army, having recovered from their injuries, are returning to the front lines. Through the careful treatment at the × unit for the wounded soldiers who marched south, 65 were able to recover and be discharged from the hospital in a very short period of time, and return to the front lines. All staff members and patients convalescing in the hospital held a meeting on the 20th to bid them farewell. Sun You'an, the representative of those discharged, said, "We are extremely grateful for the doctors' and nurses' thoughtful treatment and care, which enabled us to quickly return to the front lines to kill the enemy and perform meritorious service." He then suggested to those still receiving treatment in the hospital: "Comrades who remain in the hospital should recuperate in peace, recover completely as soon as possible, and catch up quickly." Wei Xueren, the representative of the comrades still in the hospital, also said, "It is an honor for you to go to the front lines. We will recuperate well and definitely catch up with you." The local masses also came to see them off.

　　晋南解放军大练兵
  　战斗技术迅速提高
  　豫西伤员痊愈欢欣上前线
    【本报太岳廿八日电】晋南人民解放军在前线普遍卷入“磨刀”练兵热潮中。他们的口号是：“那把刀不快就磨那把刀”。中条支队各大队，各炮兵连均以竞赛精神互相学习，交流经验，五天中学会四大本领：（一）构筑掩体，十二个人，四个钟头即可挖成。（二）在掩体内瞄准射击，三大队炮兵连四发可命中三发，一大队炮兵向距八百公尺之土堆射击，连打八发，命中五发。（三）能在统一指挥、统一目标下齐射。（四）制装底火，利用废弹。某部六连排长段福祥和王仁义，在“磨刀”中抬了二百五十斤重的梯子过跳板，四百米的距离往返过了两次。晋南支队四大队五连郎善同志说：“抓紧时间练好新兵，战斗中能顶老兵用”，所以他一有时间，就把全班带到工事附近练，同时在工事中也教育新战士瞄准射击要领，始终不让时间白白过去。
    【本报太岳二十八日电】豫西人民解放军伤员战士六十五位，伤愈再上前线。南征伤员经×所悉心治疗，得在极短期内即治愈六十五位出院，再上前线，全体工作人员及留院休养员于二十日开会欢送，出院代表孙友安说：“我们对医生看护员同志们的用心治疗招呼，使我们能很快再上前线杀敌立功，是十分感激的”。接着向还留院治疗的提出来：“留院同志要安心休养，早日全愈，快赶上来”，留院同志代表卫学仁亦说：“你们到前线是光荣的，我们要好好休养，一定赶上你们”。驻地群众亦来欢送。
