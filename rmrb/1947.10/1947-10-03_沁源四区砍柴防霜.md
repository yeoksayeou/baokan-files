Qin Yuan Fourth District Chops Firewood to Prevent Frost
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 29th] Last year in Qin Yuan, the harvest was reduced by half due to early frost. This year, in order to combat frost damage, the district convened 130 village cadres from 31 villages to discuss frost prevention work. They unanimously agreed that the first half of this year was dry and the second half was flooded, and the crops are growing slowly. The millet and corn are still green, and if they encounter frost, they will definitely be affected. However, when it came to how to prevent it, some cadres were somewhat superstitious. One cadre from Weijiazhuang said: "People can hide from people killing people, but there's no hiding from heaven killing people!" After discussion, the ideas of leaving things to fate and superstitious beliefs in the years were broken down. It was recognized that there is a reason for frost. As long as preparations are made in advance and fires are lit everywhere, the smoke will prevent the crops from frosting. Last autumn, Tian Peiyan of Shihuiwan was afraid that wild boars would eat corn, so he lit two piles of fire on the ground. When the frost came, the five mu of corn did not get frosted. It was decided to mobilize both men and women to chop pine needles, divide them into piles in advance, and cover them with soil. When frost is about to fall, they will be lit, which can prevent frost and accumulate fertilizer. The meeting also decided that each village should be jointly defended. A bundle of firewood should be placed on the mountain top of each village. When preventing frost, lighting this pile of fire will serve as a signal, and every household in every village will light a fire together. After the meeting, the villages immediately took action. According to incomplete statistics, more than ten villages, including Lianziyu, mobilized more than 80 percent of men and women to chop pine needles, and have now cut down more than 250,000 jin, divided into 575 piles. This movement is now being promoted throughout the area.

　　沁源四区砍柴防霜
    【本报太岳二十九日电】沁源去年因下霜过早，以致收成减去一半。今年为战胜霜灾，区上召集了卅一村一百三十余位村干部，讨论防霜工作。一致认为今年前半年旱，后半年涝，庄稼上的慢，谷子玉茭还是绿颜颜的，如遇下霜一定受影响，但谈到如何提防时，有的干部有些迷信，卫家庄一个干部说：“人杀人有躲处，天杀人没躲处！”经讨论后，才把听天由命和迷信天年的思想打通，认识了下霜的道理，只要事先有准备，到处点火，烟一薰庄稼就着不了霜，石会湾田培言去年秋天怕山猪吃玉茭，在地点了两堆火，下霜时五亩玉茭就没霜了。决定男女总动员砍松毛、预先分堆各地，用土蒙住，将下霜时燃着，既能防霜，又能积肥。会上又决定要各村联防，在每村的山头上放一捆干柴，防霜时以点这堆火为号，村村户户一齐把火点着。会后，各村即行动起来，据不完全统计，联子峪等十余村，动员了百分之八十以上的男女砍松毛，现已割下二十五万余斤，分成五百七十五堆，这一运动现正推行各地。
