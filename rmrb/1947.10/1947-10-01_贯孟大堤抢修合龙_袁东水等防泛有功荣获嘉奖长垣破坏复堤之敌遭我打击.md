Xinhua News Agency, Jìn Jì Lǔ Yù, 29th: The bandit Chiang Kai-shek, on the 17th of last month, breached the Guàn Mèng Dam with a 150-meter gap. After the democratic government mobilized more than 5,000 people from Chángyuán, Huá County, Qūhé, and Wèinán counties, and coordinated with local armed forces for protection and active repairs, expending more than 300,000 workdays, the breach has now been completely closed. Currently, work continues to heighten and thicken the repaired area, which will be completed soon.

This newspaper, Jì Lǔ Yù, 29th: During the peak of the Yellow River flooding season, Pú County flood prevention personnel and civilians Yuán Dōngshuǐ, Shǐ Xiù'é, and others bravely participated in disaster relief and made great contributions. The Yellow River Commission has issued a commendation order to commend them. At 11:00 AM on August 2nd, just as the Yellow River was experiencing its first surge, a breach suddenly appeared in the embankment near Shǐ Wángzhuāng, District 3, Pú County. It was discovered by Shǐ Xiù'é, the women's affairs officer of Shǐ Wángzhuāng, who urgently called for help. Yuán Dōngshuǐ, upon hearing the alarm, immediately led several people to the scene, jumped into the water, felt for the mouth of the breach, and used his own wheat straw piles to block the opening. At that time, the floodwaters had already reached the base of his village, and his wife called him to move his household, but he disregarded his family and resolutely blocked the breach. After the breach was plugged, he led people in ramming the earth. Although it was raining heavily and Chiang's planes were circling overhead, he never retreated a step. Residents of nearby villages, upon hearing the news, rushed to help. People from villages as far as 18 li away, such as Dàtún, Mǎqiáo, Mǎchǎng, and Lín Wángzhuāng, also came upon hearing the news, totaling more than a thousand people from 26 villages. After 29 hours of courageous rescue efforts, they finally blocked the breach, repaired the embankment, and averted the crisis. At noon on August 16th, during the second flood surge, a breach appeared on the outer side of the Ní Nánwáng embankment. It was immediately discovered and plugged by nearby flood prevention personnel. On the night of the 17th, a breach appeared at the base of the embankment at Dà Wángzhuāng. It was discovered by Jiāng Xiāngchuán, who was patrolling the embankment with a lantern, and he immediately called nearby flood prevention personnel, Chén Jìguì, Liú Jīndǒu, Chén Shàngbīn, Xíng Shànruì, and others, who rushed to the scene, jumped into the water, and used firewood and earth to block it. At the end of August, when the masses in Wǔxiángtún, District 6, were repairing the revetment, they also demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm. These heroes of disaster relief, regardless of all dangers and difficulties, fought resolutely against the floodwaters to protect millions of people, truly writing a glorious page in history. The Yellow River Commission has issued commendations and rewards of 50,000 yuan to encourage them.

This newspaper, Jì Lǔ Yù, 29th: After Chiang's bandits breached the Guàn Mèng Dam, in order to hinder the masses from repairing it, they dispatched a battalion of the 380th Regiment of the Sichuan Army from Chángyuán city on August 24th to harass the area. At 3:00 PM that afternoon, this unit advanced to Yúlínzhuāng and was severely attacked by a unit of the local armed forces of the Fourth Military Sub-district protecting the dam repairs. The enemy left behind more than 20 bodies and fled back to Chángyuán city.

Xinhua News Agency, Jìn Chá Jì, 28th: The Jìzhōng Administrative Office and Jìzhōng people's organizations recently jointly denounced the atrocities of Chiang's bandit troops in breaching the Dàqīng River embankment and causing floods, and pointed out: "If the Chiang bandits are not eliminated, the disasters will not end." They called on the people to fight stubbornly and eliminate the Chiang bandits. Within Xióng County, the Dàqīng River overflowed, and the floodwaters inundated more than 21,000 mu of mature autumn crops in the low-lying areas north of Bái Yángdiàn Lake. In addition to a section of the south bank's embankment near Gāojiāchǎng being breached by Chiang's bandits, Chiang's bandits also breached the Tūwěigōu embankment last month. At that time, the water was low and there was no breach. Chiang's bandits then used the flood prevention materials prepared by the Xióng County democratic government along the river to build dams three times to block the water. By the beginning of this month, the water was forced out again, pouring into the low-lying areas between the Dàqīng River and Bái Yángdiàn Lake, such as Zhīxínggōngwā and Bǎicǎowā, creating a vast expanse of water, two chi deep. Only high-yield crops can still be harvested. Before the recovery of Xióng County, farmers wading in the water to harvest crops were shot and captured eight times by Chiang's bandits.
