　　Taihang Administrative Office Directive
  　Resolve Difficulties for Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers in Autumn Plowing
  　Demanding That Not a Single Mu of Stubble Field Be Left
    [Our Newspaper, Taihang, 23rd Dispatch] Autumn harvesting and wheat sowing are nearing completion in various parts of Taihang. Furthermore, due to excessive rain and early frost after autumn, some higher ground has frozen. In order to ensure the widespread launch and rapid completion of autumn plowing, the Administrative Office has issued directives to various regions, the content of which is as follows: In this year's fight against drought, farmers have deeply understood the direct benefits of autumn plowing for ensuring seedling survival and density. Fields that were autumn-plowed last year have fuller seedlings and are more drought-resistant this year. All regions should recall this experience with concrete and vivid examples to illustrate the importance of autumn plowing, so as to achieve universal autumn plowing and leave not a single mu of stubble field. At the same time, due to attacks from drought, hail, wind, and frost over the past year, as well as heavy wartime service tasks and intense production struggles, farmers may experience feelings of fatigue after the autumn harvest. The directive calls on heroes, model workers, and activists in all regions to play an exemplary role, leading the masses to launch a fervent autumn plowing campaign. The following points should be noted during the autumn harvest: (1) Rectify mutual aid, establish leadership cadres from among poor peasants and hired laborers, and solve the problems of livestock power, farming tools, and various other difficulties faced by emancipated poor peasants and hired laborers; (2) In areas where there is a lack of labor and livestock power but abundant wasteland, inter-village and inter-county mutual support should be launched, and various contracting and labor-selling arrangements should be organized; (3) Carry forward the experiences of adjusting labor and livestock power and rationally calculating and arranging livelihoods from the summer harvest, so as to avoid wasting a single person or animal.
    [Our Newspaper, Zuoquan News] Since the beginning of autumn, there have been continuous drizzling rains, the soil roots are excessively wet, and freezing temperatures have appeared very early. If autumn plowing is not carried out quickly, stubble fields will inevitably be left, which will greatly affect next year's increased production. The Sixth District Committee, District Office, and Relief Association have issued urgent instructions to all villages, pointing out the characteristics of this year's climate and the urgency of autumn plowing. In terms of methods, during the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, except in special circumstances, the movement of people and livestock can generally be restricted. The crops of those who are in charge of plowing should be harvested on time to alleviate their concerns, so that they can plow the land with peace of mind and at a faster pace. All villages should further study and mobilize based on the instructions, organizing in a planned way, so that autumn plowing can be stepped up! Finally, the slogan is put forward: "Early freezing this year, intensify autumn plowing, keep livestock and plows busy!" "Overcome paralysis and waiting, get started as soon as possible!" "Guarantee that not a single mu of stubble field is left!" (Zhong Fu, Zi Wen, Qing Lin, Chong Zhang)
    [Our Newspaper, Xiyang News] Now that Cold Dew has passed, autumn harvesting and autumn plowing can no longer be delayed, especially with the raging winds causing great losses to mature grain, a swift and concentrated effort should be launched. However, some villages have egalitarianism in their work and unclear priorities, which affects the rapid completion of autumn harvesting and autumn plowing, leading to losses. Based on the above situation, the County Committee has issued instructions: Reviewing and rectifying village finance and other work should be temporarily suspended, and all efforts should be concentrated on autumn harvesting and autumn plowing. This year, universal plowing must be carried out once.

　　太行行署指示
  　解决贫雇秋耕困难
  　要求不留一亩茬地
    【本报太行二十三日电】太行各地秋收种麦已近结束，又因秋后雨多、霜早，部分高地上冻，行署为使秋耕普遍展开与迅速完成，特指示各地，其内容谓：农民在今年的抗旱斗争中，已深刻体会到秋耕对保垧按苗的直接利益，凡去年秋耕过的地，今年既苗全又耐旱，各地应以具体生动事例回忆这一经验，说明秋耕的重要性，做到普遍秋耕，不留一亩茬地。同时，一年来由于旱、雹、风、霜的袭击，和繁重的战勤任务与紧张的生产斗争，农民在秋收后，可能产生倦怠心理。指示中号召各地英雄、模范和积极分子起模范作用，带领群众，展开热烈的秋耕运动。在秋收中应注意：（一）整顿互助，树立贫雇领导骨干，解决翻身贫雇畜力、耕具与各种困难：（二）劳畜力缺乏而荒地又多的地方，应展开村与村、县与县的相互支援，并组织各种包工、卖工等；（三）发扬夏收中调剂劳畜力与合理计算，安排生活经验，做到不浪费一人一畜。
    【本报左权讯】入秋以来，阴雨连绵，地根过湿，冻气很早即已产生，若不很快秋耕，势必留下茬地，这对明年的增产，将要受到很大影响。六区区委会、区公所、救联会，特给各村发出紧急指示：指出今年气候的特点，与秋耕的紧急性。在办法上，在秋耕秋收当中，除特殊情形外，一般的人与牲口，可以限制出外，对掌犁人的庄稼，要给他按时收割，使他无顾虑，又安心、耕地又快。各村要根据指示，再研究动员，有组织，有计划，务使秋耕进一步加油干起来！最后提出口号：“今年早冻，加紧秋耕，牲口不闲犁不闲！”“克服麻痹等待，及早动手！”“保证不留一亩茬地！”（中富、子文、清林、崇章）
    【本报昔阳讯】现在寒露已过，秋收秋耕不容再拖，特别是大风狂起，对成熟之谷损失极大，应迅速突击。但有些村工作上平均主义，重心不明，影响秋收秋耕迅速完成，致受损失。根据以上情况县委会特发指示：复查与整顿村财政等工作，一律暂且不搞，集中全体精力秋收秋耕，今年一定要普耕一次。
