Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 28th: According to news from the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas: The people's armed forces and mass self-salvation movement in the Yixing area of southern Jiangsu are developing rapidly, and they are controlling rural political power. The people's guerrillas in areas such as @亭 and Heqiao near Yixing have grown from 200-300 people to nearly 1,000 due to the active participation of local young peasants. At the end of August, they captured Dingshan Town on the west bank of Taihu Lake in one fell swoop, annihilated a company of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit security team, and seized three machine guns and a large number of shells. In a certain battle, they also captured Chen Qingfeng, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit @亭 town head, causing the local Chiang Kai-shek bandits to be terrified. After the great victory of the People's Liberation Army Ye Ting (formerly Yancheng) in northern Jiangsu in August, Chiang Kai-shek bandits transferred half of the county security team's only eight companies from the county to northern Jiangsu. Chiang Kai-shek officials in Yixing became even more panicked. The south gate of the city is often closed all day long, with strict inspections of pedestrians. After 4:00 p.m., all four gates are closed, cutting off traffic. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit self-defense forces in various villages, fearing being defeated one by one by the people's army, concentrated near the Chiang Kai-shek bandit district office. As a result, the political power of several villages and towns was controlled by the people's guerrillas. Under the protection of their own armed forces, the local people launched a rent reduction movement and are now preparing to pay only one-fifth of the original rent, and they are even more eager for the People's Liberation Army to cross the river south as soon as possible and implement "land to the tiller." On September 14, a struggle broke out in Heqiao and Zhangqiao districts in which more than a thousand peasants confiscated reeds from landlords. Because the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were afraid of the people's guerrillas, they ordered the Taihu reed landlords to cut all the reeds. The landlords forced the tenant farmers to work without pay, and the peasants rose up in resistance and confiscated the reeds. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit security team opened fire to suppress them, killing and wounding two peasants, and the masses became even more indignant, carrying the bodies to the bandit village head's home, demanding punishment for the murderers and compensation for the victims. The situation is now expanding.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: People's militias in various parts of Guangdong are launching widespread attacks against Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. According to a compilation of news from the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao in August: On August 3, the Yangchun County militia in southeastern Guangdong captured Tangkeng Town in one fell swoop, seizing all the firearms and more than a hundred dan of rice from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit police team. On August 19, the Huiyang militia learned that Chiang Kai-shek's county magistrate Liang Guocai was about to pass through the area, so they laid mines and ambushed him at Zhuyang坑 on the highway between Huiyang and Longgang. Liang Guocai led more than 30 county government soldiers and officials in a truck, and the landmine exploded at the rear of the vehicle, causing the vehicle to stop due to severe vibration. The militia, who had been lying in ambush on the mountains on both sides, took the opportunity to rush down and fired intensively with machine guns and rifles, killing more than a dozen people on the spot. Liang escaped death by swimming. All the weapons and materials in the truck were seized by the militia. The militias in Xinfeng, Longchuan in northern Guangdong, and Jiang and Yangchun counties in southern Guangdong also launched attacks one after another, all achieving victories.

　　宜兴农民抗蒋自救
  　匪极惊恐紧闭城门
    【新华社华中二十八日电】据蒋区消息：苏南宜兴一带人民武装及群众自救运动日益发展，并控制乡村政权。宜兴附近山区＠亭、和桥等地人民游击队由于当地青年农民之积极参加，已由二三百人发展近千人，八月底一举攻克太湖西岸之丁山镇，歼灭蒋匪保安队一个连，缴获机枪三挺及大量炮弹。某次战斗中并俘获蒋匪＠亭镇长陈庆凤，使当地蒋匪心胆皆寒。八月苏北人民解放叶挺（原名盐城）大捷后，蒋匪又从该县仅有的县保安队八个连中抽调一半赴苏北，宜兴蒋匪官吏愈形恐慌，该城南门常整日紧闭，严密检查行人。下午四时后，四门皆闭，断绝交通。各乡蒋匪自卫队恐被民军各个击破，集中于蒋匪区署附近，于是若干乡镇政权遂为人民游击队控制。当地人民在自己的武装维护下，发动减租运动，现准备只缴原租额五分之一，更热望人民解放军早日南渡，实行耕者有其田。九月十四日和桥、章桥两区爆发了千余农民没收地主芦柴的斗争，因蒋匪慑于人民游击队活动，命令太湖芦地主将芦柴全部割光，地主即强迫佃农无偿劳动，农民纷起反抗，将芦柴没收。蒋匪保安队开枪镇压，死伤农民二人，群情更加激愤，将尸体抬至匪乡长家中，要求惩凶抚恤。现事态正扩展中。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】广东各地民军广泛出击蒋匪。综合沪大公报八月份消息：粤东南阳春县民军八月三日一举攻克汤坑镇，缴获蒋匪警队全部枪械及米谷百余石。八月十九日惠阳民军得悉蒋匪县长梁国材将过境，即于惠阳、龙冈间公路上之猪阳坑埋雷设伏，梁国材率领县府官兵三十余人乘卡车行经该地，地雷在车尾轰然爆炸，车受剧烈震动而停驶，预伏两边山上之民军乘势冲下，以机步枪密集射击，当场毙其十余人，梁泅水逃命，仅免于死。车中武器物资悉为民军缴获。粤北之新丰、龙川、粤南之江、阳春等县民军亦纷纷出击，均获胜利。
