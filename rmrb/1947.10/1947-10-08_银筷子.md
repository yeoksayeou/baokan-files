　　Silver Chopsticks

　　Comrade Yan Guodong's family was a landlord. Once, when he returned home, it was during a time of mass struggle. His grandmother told him, "You must leave quickly, people are going to struggle against us! Here are three silver dollars, take them to spend!" Since the silver dollars came into Comrade Guodong's hands, he was both happy that the three silver dollars could be exchanged for Jichaopiao (currency used in the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region) and worried about what he would say if he was discovered with them, and afraid he might lose them. Sure enough, he was discovered by a comrade, who asked him, "Where did you get the silver dollars?" He had no choice but to stammer embarrassedly, "A friend gave them to me." From then on, Comrade Guodong became more vigilant and worried about saving the silver dollars. Finally, he came up with a solution: to have the silver dollars made into chopsticks, so he wouldn't be afraid of losing them or being questioned. Thus, the three silver dollars became a pair of beautiful silver chopsticks.

　　After July, Comrade Guodong went to the training corps for training. After studying current affairs and land reform, and after reading many stories and communications about investigating class, investigating standpoints, and investigating thoughts in the newspapers, his thoughts began to struggle fiercely. He thought to himself, "Whose are these silver chopsticks, after all?" After a painful ideological struggle, he suddenly realized: these three silver dollars were obtained by the landlord exploiting the peasants; they were the peasants' blood and sweat, and should be returned to the peasants. But I had them made into silver chopsticks, wasn't this preserving feudalism, or even embezzling the fruits of the peasants' struggle? Finally, Comrade Guodong made up his mind. On the evening of August 29th, he explained the story of the chopsticks to the Party's responsible comrade and happily handed them over to the Party. At that time, he said, "I am a Communist Party member. I should and must stand with the peasants, thoroughly eliminate feudalism and eliminate the landlord class. I will not only hand over these silver chopsticks to the Party, so that they can play their role in the great counter-offensive, but I have also written to my family, asking them to hand over the land and houses to the peasants. If my family does not listen to me and does not do this, I will declare that I am breaking off relations with my family!" Now Comrade Yan Guodong is happily and joyfully studying.

　　银筷子
    严国栋同志的家庭是个地主。有一次他回了家，正是群众斗争的时候，他祖母告他说：“你快快走，人家要斗争咱啦，这是三块银元，你拿去化吧！”自从银元到了国栋同志的手里之后，他一方面喜欢三块银洋可以换冀钞化，一方面发愁如果被人发现了该怎样说呢，况且不小心还会丢掉。果然不久被一个同志发现了，便问他“你那里来的现洋呢”？他只得很难为情的支吾道：“是朋友送我的”。从此以后，国栋同志对现洋的保存更警惕更发愁了，最后才想出个办法，把银元打成筷子，既不怕丢，又不怕别人追究，于是三块现洋便成了一双漂亮的银筷子了。
    七月以后，国栋同志到了教导队受训，经过学习时事和土改，经过自己从报纸上看到了许多关于查阶级查立场查思想的故事和通讯，于是思想便尖锐的斗争起来了，自己想：“究竟我这双银筷子是谁的？”经过思想苦斗后，才恍然大悟的想通了：原来这三块银洋是地主剥削农民的，是农民的血汗，应该归还农民；但是我却把他打成了银筷子，这岂不是保存了封建，或说是贪污了农民的斗争果实吗？最后国栋同志下了决心，在八月二十九日的晚上，他对党的负责同志说明了筷子的经过，愉快的把他交给了党，当时他说：“我是共产党员，我应该而且必须和农民站在一起，彻底消灭封建消灭地主阶级，我不但要向党交出这双银筷子，使他在大反攻中起他能起的作用，而且我给家里去了信，让他们把内产房屋出地交给农民处理。如果家里人不听我的话，不这样做，我将宣布和家庭脱离关系！”现在严国栋同志正在高兴愉快的学习着。（太岳分社）
