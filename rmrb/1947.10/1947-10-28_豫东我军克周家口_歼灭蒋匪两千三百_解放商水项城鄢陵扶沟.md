Xinhua News Agency, Front Lines of Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui, October 26th: The People's Liberation Army, operating in eastern Henan, liberated Zhoujiakou, an important stronghold of the Chiang bandits, at 3:00 AM on the 23rd. That evening, they also liberated Shangshui County. The entire garrison of Chiang's Henan Provincial Security Regiments 3 and 4, the 7th Administrative District Office, and the "Homecoming Corps" entrenched in Zhoujiakou were annihilated. When the People's Liberation Army suddenly approached both banks of the Ying River at 2:00 PM on the 22nd, launching a pincer attack on Zhoujiakou, the defending enemy panicked and were unable to escape. Within two hours of the People's Liberation Army's entry into the city, the enemy soldiers were captured one after another. According to preliminary statistics, more than 1,500 Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers were killed or captured, and a large number of weapons and supplies were seized. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army defeated Chiang's bandit cavalry 1st Brigade, which was reinforcing Zhoujiakou from Shangshui County, in the area of Baliwan, Jiazhuang, and Zhoujiazhuang, south of Zhoujiakou, on the 23rd, annihilating and capturing more than 800 men, and seizing some horses and ammunition. The People's Liberation Army pursued the victory and liberated Shangshui County that evening. The remaining enemy troops defending the city fled southwest. Zhoujiakou is an important commercial and transportation center in eastern Henan, spanning both banks of the Ying River. Its seventy-two streets are lined with shops and companies. Agricultural products from Huaiyang, Xihua, Shangshui, and other counties, as well as along the Ying River, are collected and distributed here. The city is only 60 kilometers west of Luohe in Yancheng, a key location in central Henan, and is also the terminal for the Ying River, the largest tributary of the Huai River. From the city, ships can travel southeast directly to Bengbu. There are also highways to Huaiyang, Xihua, Shangshui, and Luohe.

Xinhua News Agency, Front Lines of Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui, October 26th: The People's Liberation Army liberated Xiangcheng in eastern Henan on the morning of the 21st. The defending enemy fled upon hearing the news.

Xinhua News Agency, Front Lines of Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui, October 26th: The People's Liberation Army, in coordination with local armed forces in Yu, Wan, and Su, recovered Fugou and Yanling counties in eastern Henan for the third time on the 18th. The remnants of the enemy's security police fled upon hearing the news. The People's Liberation Army pursued the victory and continued to capture Chiang bandit strongholds such as Zhangzhuji, Zhileji, and Shunyangji between Fugou, Yanling, and Weishi, as well as vast areas west of the Yellow River flood area. Currently, the local masses, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, are enthusiastically launching the anti-Chiang Kai-shek revenge and land redistribution movement to stand up and be masters of their own land.

Xinhua News Agency, Front Lines of Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui, October 26th: A unit of the People's Liberation Army ambushed a Chiang Kai-shek military train and an armored car near Jiagou Station on the Jinpu Railway south of Xuzhou on the 18th, destroying both and seizing some military uniforms.
