Zhang Jing Organizes the Entire Village's Labor Force to Harvest, Plant, and Plow Simultaneously

[From Our Correspondent in Pingshun] Zhang Jing Village, in the First District, held a mass meeting on the night of the 6th of this month to discuss the integration of harvesting, plowing, and wheat planting. First, they organized all labor and animal power, specifically divided tasks, and clarified responsibilities. Everyone first studied the difficulties in this year's harvesting and plowing: a shortage of labor, bad weather, heavy autumn rains, and early frost, and a particular lack of labor. This year is the year of the counter-offensive, and we must also harvest well, plow all the land twice, plant more wheat, and harvest more grain. The autumn rains are heavy, and the frost comes early, so we can't drag it out for too long. Some said that plowing the land twice in our village is no problem, showing a nonchalant attitude. A mass calculation was then launched. The whole village has 2,002 mu of land. In addition to the 314 mu already planted with wheat, there are still 2,188 mu. There are a total of 59 yokes of livestock. On average, each yoke plows 2 mu per day, so plowing everything twice would take nearly 40 days. Because the autumn rains are heavy and the frost comes early, it may freeze by the beginning of winter and be impossible to plow. There is just over a month left. If we can plow by the first day of the tenth lunar month, that's a total of one month and five days. There is a difference of 418 mu that cannot be plowed twice. What should we do? Yue Fangqi, the political director, said: "This year, plowing can no longer be like hoeing three times, leaving a tail. We put in the effort, but get the name of not finishing the hoeing. This year, we must resolutely plow everything clean, leaving not a single sliver. Quickly finish the autumn harvest and organize manpower well." Li Gaosheng said: "We worked hard from dawn till dusk for a year, and we must harvest well this autumn. After a good harvest, we must plow all the land twice, and plant another 240 mu of wheat after the harvest. There will be many difficulties." After everyone's discussion, it was concluded that all the village's men, women, old and young, labor and animal power must be completely organized. Everyone who can work a little should work a little. No one in the village should be idle. Temporary contracting, according to work points, specific division of labor, and clear responsibilities. They then selected skilled plowmen to be in charge of plowing, skilled harvesters to be in charge of harvesting, and also established an Autumn Harvest and Plowing Committee, publicly electing the village head and political director as the director and deputy director, respectively, and selecting harvest and plowing captains and technical committee members to lead the harvesting, plowing, and wheat planting separately. They also organized 96 young and strong people into five shock brigades to temporarily rush to harvest and thresh grain at night, etc. After the fixed workers were assigned specific tasks, the whole village universally implemented the method of cutting, carrying, harvesting during the day and carrying at night, plowing immediately after the harvest, and planting while harvesting. Zhang Chengfa worked hard at night, carrying back 55 bundles of grain in two hours, earning 11 work points (contracting according to distance). Second, calculate the yield and practice strict economy, not wasting a handful of grain, not scattering a handful of chaff, not dropping a single vegetable. Actual experiments showed that the yield was at most 60%, breaking the original estimates of 80% or 90%. After budgeting, this year is the year of the counter-offensive, with large consumption, so we must produce more grain for the counter-offensive. There is much participation in the war, large expenses, and if we are not frugal, we will end up short. However, the common habit of the masses is "whether we harvest or not, we eat for the whole autumn." Duan Quan said: "My Chen family's field yielded seven shi last year, but only four shi this year. This year is a bad year!" Liu Cai said: "This summer's call for frugality started from the bottom of the jar, now we must save from the mouth of the jar." In this way, breaking the wasteful habit of "whether we harvest or not, we eat for the whole autumn," the slogan "Don't forget the famine during the autumn harvest, don't waste a handful of grain, don't scatter a handful of chaff, don't drop a single vegetable, chaff and vegetables are half a year's food" was put forward. Everyone also set out standards for meritorious service in harvesting and plowing: Men who plow all the autumn land twice will receive one merit, those who plow all the edges of the fields will receive one merit (in the past, most did not plow the edges), those who harvest cleanly, without losing a handful of grain, a handful of chaff, or a single vegetable, and who are not wasteful will receive one merit, and those who harvest and plow well for military families, southbound cadres' families, and participating militia will receive one merit. Women who personally go to the fields and harvest to the end will receive one merit, those who can lead a group to implement work points and harvest to the end will receive one merit, those who plow one mu of stubble will receive one merit, those who can spin one jin of cotton (per month) during the autumn harvest will receive one merit, and those who are not wasteful, do not lose a handful of grain, a handful of chaff, or a single vegetable will receive one merit. After setting out the standards for meritorious service, the five brigades (totaling 290 households) in the whole village challenged each other, guaranteeing that all the autumn land in the whole brigade would be plowed twice, the autumn harvest would be good, no grain would be lost, and no chaff or vegetables would be scattered. If they lost, they would buy two pots, and the captain would lead the whole brigade to deliver them. Now the entire village, old and young, is completely involved in the autumn plowing movement, all with the determination to win a victory and make great contributions. (Han Qing)

　　张井组织全村劳力
  　收种耕一齐干
    【本报平顺讯】一区张井村本月六日夜召开群众大会，讨论收耕种麦结合问题。一、组织一切劳畜力，具体分工，明确责任。大家首先研究了今年收耕中的困难，是劳力缺，天不好，秋雨多，上冻早，劳力又特别缺乏。今年是反攻年，又得把秋收好，地全犁下两遍，多种麦子多收粮食，秋雨多，上冻早，又不能拖长时间，有的说咱村犁两遍地不成问题，表现着满不在乎思想，即展开了群众性的精确计算，全村共地二千○二亩，除已种麦三百一十四亩外，还有二千一百八十八亩，共有五十九犋牲口，平均每犋一天犁二亩，全犁两遍就得近四十天，因为秋雨多，上冻早，一到立冬就可能上冻不能犁，还有一月多时间，如能犁到十月初一日，共一月零五天，相差四百一十八亩犁不下二遍，该怎办？政治主任岳方其说：“今年耕地再不能像锄三遍那样，留下个尾巴，力也出啦，落个未锄完的名，今年坚决犁光不留一厘，赶快收完秋，组织人力好”。李高生说：“搭黑起早受了一年，这个秋可得收好哩，收好秋还得全犁下两遍地，再种二百四十亩改茬麦，困难就多了。”经大家讨论结果，必须把全村男女老少劳畜力完全组织起来，能干一点干一点，全村不闲一个人，临时包工，按活折工，具体分工，明确责任。便选择了犁地能手专管犁地，收割能手专管收秋，还成立了秋收秋耕委员会，公推村长、政治主任等为正付主任，并选出收耕正副队长，技术委员，分别领导收耕种麦，并组织了青壮年九十六人为五个突击队，临时突击收割，黑夜打谷打场等。当固定把式具体分工后，全村普遍实行了割的割，扛的扛，白天割黑夜扛，前头收后头犁，一面收一面种的办法，张成法黑夜突击，两个钟头扛回五十五捆谷，赚回十一响工票（按远近包工）。二、计算年成厉行节约，不丢一把粮，不撒一把糠，不掉一颗菜。实际试验了年成，顶大六成，打破了原来八成九成的估计。又预算了一下，今年是反攻年，消耗大，得多出反攻粮，参战多，开支大，如不节约就会弄个后不接，而群众普遍习惯是“收不收吃一秋”。段全则说：“我陈家一处地去年打了七石，今年才打了四石，今年是个赖年景！”刘才则说：“今年夏天号召节约是从缸底哩，现在要从缸口省起”。这样，打破“收不收吃一秋”的浪费习惯，即提出“秋收不要忘灾荒，不丢一把粮，不撒一把糠，不掉一颗菜，糠菜半年粮”的口号，大家又订出了收耕中的立功标准：男人是全部秋耕两遍者立一功，全盘下地头者立一功（往年多不盘地头），秋收净，不丢掉一把粮，一把糠、一颗菜，不浪费者立一功，给军属、南下干属、参战民兵收耕好者立一功。妇女是亲自上地，收秋到底者立一功，能带领一组实行折工，秋收到底者立一功，盘一亩茬子者立一功，在秋收中能捎带纺一斤花（一月）者立一功，不浪费，不丢掉一把粮、一把糠、一颗菜者立一功。经分别订出立功标准后，全村五个大队（共二百九十户），互相提出挑战，保证全队秋地全部翻下两遍，秋收好，不丢掉粮食，不撒掉糠菜，输了买两口，队长带领全队送。现在全村老小完全卷入秋耕运动，都抱着争取打胜仗立大功的决心。（汉卿）
