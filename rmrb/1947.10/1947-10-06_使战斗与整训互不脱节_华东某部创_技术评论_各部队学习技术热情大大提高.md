Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 4th: Following the "Assessment of Casualties," the Yang Xie Regiment of a certain unit of the East China People's Liberation Army has taken a further step by creating "Technical Review," greatly increasing the enthusiasm of various units for learning technology. "Technical Review" is applicable both during wartime and peacetime, and its content is broader than "Assessment of Casualties," including casualties, actions, utilization of terrain and features, coordination of firepower and movement, command skills, earthwork operations, and field services. The regiment used "Technical Review" during training in March of this year, replacing the past educational methods that were divorced from actual combat. Recently, it has been reapplied to post-battle reviews, earning everyone's welcome and attention. In the "Technical Reviews" of the Fourth Company of the regiment, many soldiers automatically studied the use of submachine guns after examples were given of casualties resulting from not knowing how to use captured submachine guns. After typical "Technical Review" demonstrations were conducted in each company, a summary mobilization was carried out, using examples to illustrate the role of "Technical Review." The regimental leadership also convened key personnel to study the leadership methods for class and platoon "Technical Review" meetings, so that "Technical Review" penetrated to the class and platoon level. Currently, the Yang Xie Regiment has initially summarized four methods of "Technical Review": individual review, central discussion, comparative review, and practical review. To further promote "Technical Review," the regiment has specifically decided: A, the company's "Technical Review" should be combined with practice. After the company conducts a "Technical Review" of its central issues, it should immediately conduct exercises, then review and practice again, so that a problem is repeatedly "reviewed" and "done" to achieve thorough understanding and mastery of the technology, making combat and training inseparable. B, "Technical Review" should be combined with the commendation movement. Use the commendation movement to promote technical learning, and at the same time, through "Technical Review," make the commendation more profound and accurate.

　　使战斗与整训互不脱节
  　华东某部创“技术评论”
  　各部队学习技术热情大大提高
    【新华社华东前线四日电】继“评定伤亡”之后，华东解放军某部杨谢团更进一步创造“技术评论”，大大提高了各部队学习技术热情。“技术评论”无论战时平时均通用，且内容比“评定伤亡”广泛，包括伤亡、动作、利用地形地物、火力与运动配合、指挥艺术、土工作业及野外勤务等。该团在今年三月整训中即已用“技术评论”，代替了过去脱离战斗实际的教育方法，最近复用于战后检讨，博得大家欢迎与重视。该团四连战士在“技术”中发，因缴到冲锋枪后不会使用致反遭伤亡的例子，很多战士便自动学习冲锋枪使用法。开始各连经过典型“技评”示范后，复进行总结性的动员，以实例说明“技评”作用，团领导上又召集骨干分子研究班、排“技评”会议之领导方法，于是“技评”便深入到了班、排。现杨谢团初步总结出“技评”的四种方法，即：各个评论、中心论、对比评论和实习评论。为进一步开展“技评”，该团特决定：甲、连的“技评”与实习相结合。连进行其中心问题“技评”后，应立即演习，再评再演，使一个问题反复“评”“做”，达到彻底了解与熟练技术，使战斗与整训互不脱节。乙、“技评”与评功运动结合。运用评功运动推动技术学习，同时经过“技评”也使评功更深刻正确。
