　　Su Village Discovers in Inspection:
　　Qingjia Village Only Focused on Transportation;
　　Not a Single Mu of Autumn Land Plowed
　　[Our newspaper Changzhi news] The Second District Su Village held a connection meeting, deciding to inspect each other, exchange experiences, learn from each other, and promote the early completion of autumn plowing in each village. On October 19th, each village selected inspectors, along with district cadres, to inspect each village. Ten people participated, including hero district village cadres. The inspection found that villages such as Tianhe, Su Village, and Beidong, due to good division of labor and living arrangements, autumn plowing had become a mass movement; women and children were organized. Qingjia Village is a natural village of Jiaojia Village, with more than 80 households in the whole village and more than 60 livestock, but not even one mu of land had been plowed. The main reasons are emphasizing sideline occupations while neglecting agriculture and having paralyzing thoughts of waiting. The livestock were all making money in Handan, and the people at home were doing odd jobs, waiting for the livestock to come back and plow, without the need for people to do it themselves. They were afraid they wouldn't be able to finish it when the ground froze? They did not recognize that this year is a leap month year, with excessive autumn rain, and the ground will freeze early. Some groups in Shantou Village also had livestock going to transport goods, so they were not fully mobilized. Based on the above situation, the better villages have mastered the "four haves" and applied them, which are having a plan, having arrangements, having inspections, and having summaries, so they have achieved greater results. After summarizing, there are the following points of experience: 1. Cadres should lead by example, play a leading role, and promote the masses. For example, Tianhe is doing well because Cao Linshui personally raised the issue. He is both the political director and a labor hero. Su Village's Bi Eryun is a labor hero and chairman of the farmers' association, while the leader of the Da Chou group in Beidong does not go to the field, and the group members do not move in the field. 2. Poor and hired peasants should be masters of their own affairs and play a backbone and leading role. 3. Launch a mass labor ticket grabbing movement. For example, Wang Changshui of Cao Linshui's brigade in Nantianhe is very capable of labor, but before the work was assigned according to the job, he would either sit or sleep whenever he worked in the field. After Linshui discovered this problem, he implemented the labor ticket grabbing movement. Now he is always ahead of others and can do the work of one and a half people. 4. Organize women to help with most of the work. In the past, it was thought that women were not capable, but this time in the inspection, the facts in Beidong proved that their strength is great. 5. Appropriate living arrangements ensure that all work is not delayed. The living arrangements of mutual aid groups are the most important. If they are not done well, everything will be delayed; if they are done well, nothing will be delayed. For example, in Cao Linshui's brigade, women grind public grain and men dig the ground, which is well arranged. 6. Start early, break the paralyzing waiting and the idea of emphasizing sideline occupations while neglecting agriculture. All surprise work should be started early. As the saying goes, "The early bird catches the worm." Especially autumn plowing, if you start late, the land cannot be plowed, and there is no need to wait for anything. You cannot be paralyzed, but only draw out the surplus labor force to engage in sideline occupations. If you cannot draw it out, do not force it, and you should not put down the central work to do other work. 7. Newly established villages only need to become mass movements, and then slowly use accounting methods to get through the masses' thinking before going deeper. For example, Beidong was lagging behind in all work in the past, but this time the enthusiasm for autumn plowing is very high. It is just that a mass movement was launched first, and then equal value exchange and work-based accounting methods were carried out. Finally, everyone pointed out the direction of the next inspection and what each village should do when they return. First of all, it was decided that the land that has not been plowed in each village should be marked with signs, stating "The stubble field of ×× village ×× group ×× person." When inspecting, there is no need to ask to know. Then each village will give opinions, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, and do the work better. (Huai Yong)

　　苏店小区检查发现
  　青家庄只顾运输
  　秋地一亩都没犁
    【本报长治讯】二区苏店小区召开接头会议，决定互相检查，也能交流经验，互相学习，还能促进各村提前完成秋耕。十月十九号各村抽出检查员，协同区干部到各村检查，参加者有英雄区村干部共十人，检查发现天河、苏店、北董等村，因分工安排生活好，秋耕已成了群众性的运动；妇女儿童都组织起来了。青家庄是焦家庄的一个自然村，全村八十多户，就有牲口六十来个，可是连一亩地也没有犁，主要是重副轻农及等待麻痹思想，牲口都到邯郸赚钱花，在家的人作零碎生活，等待着牲口回来再犁，用不着人动手，到地冻还怕完不成哩？就没有认清今年是闰月年，秋雨过多，地冻要早。山头村也有部分组的牲口去运输了，所以没有全部动开。根据以上情况，比较好的村掌握了四有，并且也应用了他，就是有计划，有布置，有检查，有总结，所以成绩较大，经过总结有以下几点经验：一、干部要以身作则，起带头作用，推动群众，如天河搞的好，是曹林水亲自提的，他既是政治主任，又是劳动英雄，苏店毕二云是劳动英雄，农会主席，而北董大臭组组长不去地，组员们在地里不动了。二、贫雇要当家，起骨干和代头作用。三、开展群众抢工票运动。如南天河曹林水大队的王长水很能劳动，可是在没有按活计工前，他每逢作到地头，不是坐就是睡，当林水发现这问题后，实行了抢工票运动，他现在总在人前头，能顶一个半人劳动。四、组织妇女帮大半，从前都认为妇女不顶事，这次在检查中，北董的事实证明了，她们的力量就是大。五、生活安排适当，一切工作才不误。互助组的生活安排是最主要的，闹不好就是都耽误，闹好了，是都不误。如曹林水大队，妇女碾公粮，男人刨地，安排很好。六、要即早动手，打破麻痹等待和重副轻农思想，凡是突击性的工作，就应当早些着手，俗话说：“先下手为强，后下手遭殃。”特别是秋耕，下手迟了，地就不能犁，用不着再等待什么，更不能麻痹，只能抽出剩余劳力去干副业，抽不出来也不要勉强，更不应放下中心工作去做别的工作。七、新起来的村，只是成为群众性的运动就行了，然后再慢慢的用算帐办法打通群众思想，再来深入。如北董从前一切工作都落后，这次秋耕的劲头很大，就是先轰轰烈烈的成了群众性的大运动，再来进行等价交换，按活计工法。最后大家又指出下期检查的方针和各村回去应该怎样办，首先决定各村没有犁的地要插牌子，写明××村××组××人的茬地，到检查时不用问就知道了，接着各村都提意见，取长补短互相学习，把工作搞的更好。（怀永）
