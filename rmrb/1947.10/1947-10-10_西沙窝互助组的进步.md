　　The Progress of the Xishawo Mutual Aid Team
　　Zhu Bo
　　Xishawo Village in the Xingtai New District has a total of 3,400 mu of cultivated land. During last year's autumn harvest and wheat planting, under the slogan of "not leaving a single mu uncultivated," everyone in the village was forced to join mutual aid teams according to their street. Village cadres and those without labor benefited, while well-off middle peasants and newly turned-over peasants suffered losses. No one knew exactly who lost how much or who benefited how much. The peasants called this kind of mutual aid team a "muddle-headed team," and it barely managed to survive until wheat planting before collapsing completely.
　　The forced organization of mutual aid caused many misunderstandings among the villagers. The well-off middle peasants believed that "mutual aid is meant to take care of village cadres and households without labor." Some newly turned-over peasants also had this "taking care of" view. The village cadres believed that "we耽误 (dānwù) [delay, hold-up] so much work for the sake of our jobs, it's only right for the mutual aid team to do some work for us." Households without labor developed the idea that "anyway, they won't let a single mu be left uncultivated, the government is calling for mutual aid, which means those with labor should do the work for us."
　　This spring, after understanding the above situation, the district cadres, addressing the above thoughts, proposed "mutual aid should be voluntary and based on equivalent exchange, especially requiring village cadres to let go." The peasants were stirred by these slogans. They asked each other, "Is it really going to be voluntary?" But the village cadres saw "voluntary and letting go" as meaning they couldn't interfere at all, and felt that being a village cadre was unlucky anyway, doing work would delay their own work, and delaying their work would mean they couldn't plant their land.
　　For several days, the mutual aid work made no progress. The leadership held another meeting of village cadres, explaining that "voluntary and letting go does not mean letting things drift," and calling on "village cadres to perform meritorious service for the people." Hou Yulin, an activist in the turn-over movement, thought after the meeting: what the district leader said is right, being an activist during the turn-over is not enough, now that it's production time, we must also strive to be an activist. Some village cadres and activists began to understand.
　　The leadership then called on everyone to connect individually and combine freely, and strive to make the entire family voluntary. The six families connected by activist Hou Yulin truly achieved family-wide voluntarism. Lu Junying's family in that group mobilized their family members, saying: "Our family is forming a mutual aid with the six families of Yulin and Hongye, do you have any objections to those families?" His wife thought for a moment and said: "Our family has always had dealings with their families, and we have never argued." This group truly organized with mutual consent. The leadership used this group as an example for education. Within seven or eight days, seventy-eight households were organized, forming ten mutual aid teams.
　　As the mutual aid movement initially took off, the village chief and deputy village chief Lu Qifan and others, who had been too detached from the masses last year, were isolated and stayed at home sleeping. The village chief's wife said to him: "How did you mess this up? What a waste of your being the village chief, they don't even want us in the mutual aid team!" The village chief was speechless. They slept for two days straight before taking the initiative to find the district cadres, reflected on the forced organization of mutual aid last year, and admitted that it was wrong not to participate in labor themselves last year, expressing their determination to organize a good mutual aid team. The village chief and deputy village chief mobilized separately, but were rebuffed. As a result, the village chief found his uncle, and the deputy village chief found his elder brother, repeatedly assuring them that mutual aid would not be disadvantageous and that they would never not participate in labor themselves like last year. The group elected Wen Qide (the deputy village chief's elder brother) as the group leader.
　　Before this year's wheat harvest, only Lu Hongye's group implemented work points, and they were able to hold a meeting every night to settle the day's work accounts and plan the work to be done the next day. At the beginning of the wheat harvest, the leadership seized upon Hongye's group and conducted an education for all the mutual aid teams in the village, reiterating that it was necessary to achieve equivalent exchange and not just talk about generosity. Wen Qide's group achieved looking at the work, not the person. Men, women, and children in the mutual aid team all participated in harvesting, and after harvesting for a day, they conducted a democratic evaluation of work. The village chief's wife, Wang Quanzhi, and Wen Qide harvested the fastest, and everyone agreed that they should each be credited with twelve work points. Hu Yugui was assessed at eight work points, and he disagreed, saying: "I'm worth more than ten work points as a carpenter, and now you're only crediting me with eight work points!" The group leader found his home in the evening and explained to him: "Harvesting wheat is calculated according to harvesting wheat, and weeding seedlings will be calculated according to weeding seedlings. You are now worth eight work points, but when it comes to weeding seedlings, you may be worth more than anyone else." Hu Yugui listened and said: "I'm just not good at harvesting wheat, I have to have someone take over every time I finish a row. If it's carpentry, I'll definitely be worth more than them!"
　　Immediately after the wheat harvest, there was a major inspection of mutual aid. When Hu Weigui's group reported, Hu Weigui said: "Our group has nothing to say, anyway, we've helped each other, and the wheat has been harvested!" Lu Qinggui from the group said: "What does our group have to say?" Others said: "No matter what, you have to talk about how to improve?" Lu Qinggui then said: "Some people in our group can't even keep up with half of what I do, and they're still getting ten work points. Every time I harvest to the end of the row, I still get ten work points anyway, who wants to put in that kind of foolish effort." Finally, the group members proposed to re-evaluate the work and settle the accounts after the meeting, and only then was the problem resolved.
　　The result of the inspection after the wheat harvest was that the whole village saved one hundred and thirty-two workdays. At that time, there were a total of twenty-two mutual aid teams, with a total of one hundred and five households participating in mutual aid. Among them, there were still three "muddle-headed teams" (these three muddle-headed teams were all organized by fathers-in-law and sons-in-law, and older brothers and younger brothers). The only people in the village who did not participate in mutual aid were those without labor and some well-off middle peasants whose thinking had not been straightened out. After sowing and weeding, the number of households participating in mutual aid teams expanded to one hundred and sixteen, and the new participants were all looking for model teams.

　　西沙窝互助组的进步
    朱波
    邢台新区西沙窝村，共种地三千四百亩。去年秋收与种麦时，在“不荒一亩地”的口号下，全村不论是谁，都强迫按街道入了互助组。村干及无劳力的沾了光，有劳力的老中农及新翻身农民吃了亏。究竟谁吃了多少亏，沾了多少光，谁也不知道。农民将这种互助组叫做“糊涂组”，勉强维持到种麦，就全部垮台了。
    强迫组织的互助，使该村农民产生了许多误解，老中农认为“互助是叫照顾村干及无劳力户”；部分新翻身农民，也有这种“照顾”的看法。村干部认为“我们为工作不知误了多少工，互助组给做些活是应该的”。无劳力户在思想上产生了“反正不叫荒一亩地，政府叫互助，就是要你们有劳力的给俺做活”。
    今春区干在该村了解以上情况后，针对着上述的思想，提出“互助要自愿等价，特别要求村干部大放手”。农民听到这几个口号，都酝酿起来了。见面后都互相询问“真的叫自愿了吗？”而村干部把“自愿、放手”看成丝毫也不能过问了，觉得当村干反正倒霉，做工作就要误工，误了工不能种地。
    互助工作几天都没有什么进展，领导上又召开村干部会，说明“自愿放手，不是任其自流”，号召“村干为人民立功”。翻身运动中的积极分子侯玉林在会后思想着：区长说的就是对，翻身是积极分子，不能光翻身呀，现在生产，也要争个积极分子，部分村干部积极分子开始想通了。
    领导上这时号召大家个别串连，自由结合，并争取做到全家都自愿，积极分子侯玉林串连的六家，就真正做到全家自愿。该组陆军营动员他家里的人说：“咱家里和玉林洪业他六家成立互助，你们对他几家有意见不”？他老婆想了想说：“咱和他几家都有来往，从没有抬过杠，（吵嘴的意思）”，这组真正心同意合的组织起来了。领导上以此组为例，进行教育。七、八天内，组织起来七十八户，组成十个互助组。
    互助运动初步搞起来，去年脱离群众太甚的正副村长积极分子陆起范等，被孤立起来，闲在家里睡觉。村长老婆说他：“你怎么混的？亏了你当村长哩，连互助组里都不要咱？”说的村长不吭气。他们直睡了两天，才主动的去找区干部，对去年强迫组织互助，做了反省，检讨去年互助组自己不参加劳动是不对的，表示决心组织搞好一个互助组。正副村长分头动员，都碰了钉子，结果村长找到他叔父，副村长找到了他哥哥，再三保证互助不吃亏，决不象去年一样自己不参加劳动。该组推选温起德（副村长哥哥）为组长。
    今年麦收前，全村仅有陆洪业组实行工票，能每天晚上开接头会，清算当天的工帐，计划明天应做的活。开始麦收时，领导上抓紧了洪业组，对全村互助组进行了一次教育，再次提出要做到等价，不能只讲涵厚。温起德组做到了看活不看人，互助组男女儿童都参加割，割了一天便进行民主评工。村长老婆王全芝、温起德割的最快，大家同意他俩顶十二分工。胡玉贵被评成八分工，他不同意说：“我当木匠顶十分工还多哩，现在才叫我顶八分工！”组长晚上找到他家里，给他解释：“现在割麦是按割麦算，将来锄苗按锄苗算，你现在是八分工，锄苗时说不定比谁也顶的多。”胡玉贵听了说：“割麦咱就是不行，每割一趟，都得叫别人接。要做木工，我一定比他们顶的多！”
    麦收后紧接着互助大检查，胡为贵组汇报时，胡为贵说：“俺组里没有啥说的，反正是互助起来啦，麦子也割完啦！”该组陆庆贵说：“俺组有啥说的？”别人说：“不管怎样也得说说看怎么能改进？”陆庆贵紧接着说：“俺这个组里有的人连我一半都赶不上，也顶十分工。我每一趟割到头，反正都是十分工，谁愿意出那些憨力气。”最后组员提出散会后重新评工算帐，问题才解决了。
    麦收后检查的结果，全村省一百三十二个工，当时互助组共二十二个，参加互助的共一百零五户，其中仍有三个“糊涂组”（这三个糊涂组都是丈人和女婿，亲哥和亲弟组织起来的），全村没有参加互助的，仅剩下无劳力的和一些未打通思想的老中农。经过下种锄苗，参加互助组的户数扩大到一百一十六户，新参加的都是找模范组。
