    I. Market Conditions and Prices:
    Grains: Grain prices generally rose in the region, and the upward trend was particularly strong after the 10th; the rise was slower in Taihang and Taiyue, and the most significant in Jinnan and Hebei-Shandong-Henan. In Jincheng, Taiyue, millet rose from 1360 yuan per market dou at the beginning of the month to 1600 yuan on the 5th, corn rose from 800 yuan to 850 yuan, and wheat was stable at 1500 yuan. In Xin District, Pinglu, wheat was 1000-1100 yuan per market dou on the 5th. In Shan County, western Henan, millet was 1500 yuan per market dou on the 5th, wheat was 1400 yuan, and corn was 1000 yuan. In Changzhi, Taihang, sales were fast and prices were stable in the first ten days, with millet (per market dou) at 1500 yuan, wheat at 1600 yuan, and corn at 750 yuan. In Yangyi, from the 4th to the 15th, millet gradually rose from 115 yuan to 140 yuan per market jin, wheat was 135 yuan, reaching 142 yuan on the 6th, and now it is back to 135 yuan.

In Xingtai, millet rose from 127 yuan to 148 yuan per ping jin on the 5th, wheat rose from 140 yuan to 144 yuan, corn was 96 yuan, and soybeans were 146 yuan. On the 13th, millet returned to 138 yuan, wheat to 137 yuan, and corn to 93 yuan. In Handan City, from the 3rd to the 15th, rice first rose and then fell, while coarse grains first fell and then rose, and wheat remained stable. Rice reached 160 yuan per jin on the 6th, then fell to 158 yuan after the 7th, and continued to fall to around 140 yuan on the 14th. Corn was 85 yuan before the 7th, and sorghum was 65 yuan, but later corn rose to around 90 yuan, and sorghum to 75 yuan. Wheat remained stable at 135 yuan, and lower quality at 125 yuan. In Nangong, Jinnan, millet rose from 138 yuan to 165 yuan per jin from the 5th to the 13th, wheat rose from 150 yuan to 165 yuan, and sorghum rose from 96 yuan to 100 yuan. In Xiajin, millet rose from 75 yuan to 77 yuan per jin from the 1st to the 10th, wheat remained stable at 120 yuan, and sorghum rose from 45 yuan to 55 yuan. In Linqing, millet rose from 105 yuan to 123 yuan from the 4th to the 9th, wheat rose from 102 yuan to 108 yuan, and sorghum rose from 56 yuan to 67 yuan. In Hebei-Shandong-Henan: In Puyang, from the 5th to the 15th, grain prices soared and then leveled off. Millet suddenly reached 3000 yuan per double market dou on the 7th from 1800 yuan, then fell to 2100 yuan, wheat rose from 1600 yuan to 2100 yuan, and sorghum rose from 600 yuan to 1250 yuan. The characteristics of grain prices in the past half month: rice and coarse grains rose, wheat was stable, and grain prices fluctuated greatly in border areas and war-affected areas, while prices were stable in inland areas.
    Cotton: Since the beginning of October, cotton sales have been brisk - exports from Linqing and Puyang on the eastern front are smooth, and cotton prices have risen sharply. The rise is significant in Jinnan and Hebei-Shandong-Henan, while prices are stable in Taihang and Taiyue. In Puyang, the price of rang cotton per jin (plus three on the scale) soared from 700 yuan to 1040 yuan from the 7th to the 12th, and returned to 800 yuan on the 15th. In Linqing, the price rose from 560 yuan to 630 yuan per jin from the 9th to the 12th. In Handan, the price rose sharply from 460 yuan to 550 yuan from the 6th to the 15th, and then continued to rise to 640 yuan on the 15th. In Xingtai, the price was 600 yuan at the beginning of the month, dropped to 560 yuan on the 10th, and then rose to 730 yuan on the 13th. In areas west of the Pinghan Railway, prices were stable, with 550-600 yuan in Yangyi from the 1st to the 15th. In Changzhi, the price was around 600 yuan in the first ten days. In Jincheng, the price was 700 yuan on the 5th. In southern Shanxi, prices were generally lower at 500-600 yuan. In Pinglu, the price was high due to being an export area, at 700-650 yuan in the first ten days. In the Jiang area, cotton prices soared in October: in Jinan, the price rose from 1.9 million yuan to 4 million yuan from the 1st to the 12th, in Tianjin the price also reached 3 million yuan in the first ten days, in Beiping the price was 3.2 million yuan on the 1st, in Xuzhou the price was 2.65 million yuan in early October, and in Shanghai the price was 3.4 million yuan (all in Jiang currency per hundred jin).
    Homespun Cloth: Homespun cloth was generally stable (after the 6th and 7th), but was also showing a trend of rising due to the influence of rising cotton and grain prices. In Puyang, the price was 240 yuan per double foot from the 12th to the 15th. In Jinnan in the first ten days, the price of Guangping cloth was 25 yuan per square foot (same below), 105 yuan in Quzhou, 106 yuan in Nangong, 105 yuan in Hengshui, and 100 yuan in Linqing. In Handan, the price rose from 260 yuan to 270 yuan per double market foot from the 7th to the 15th, and the price of lower quality cloth rose from 210 yuan to 230 yuan. In Xingtai, the price rose from 210 yuan to 230 yuan per foot (1.6 chi) on the 13th. In Yangyi, the price was around 1700 yuan (per market jin) in the first half of the month. In Changzhi, the price was stable at around 240 yuan per foot (1.6 chi) in the first ten days. In Jincheng, the price was 155 yuan per market foot for high quality cloth and 130 yuan for lower quality cloth on the 5th. In Xin District, Pinglu, the price was particularly high at 260 yuan per market foot on the 5th. Homespun cloth is still the most sluggish commodity among all goods, with prices the same compared to last month, but sales are faster. As the harsh winter approaches, cloth may continue to be active.
    Salt: Salt was slightly the same as last month, generally stable, but some places slightly increased prices due to the rising prices of cotton and grain. In Puyang, the price was 150 yuan from the 7th to the 15th, in Linqing the price was 100-90 yuan before the 9th, and then rose to 120 yuan. In Nangong, the price was 150 yuan from the 5th to the 13th. In Handan, the price was around 130 yuan before the 6th, and then rose to 136 yuan, and the price of high-quality goods rose to 148 yuan after the 14th. In Xingtai, the price rose from 145 yuan on the 5th to 155 yuan on the 13th. In Yangyi, the price of rice remained unchanged for half a month, at 155-160 yuan. In Changzhi on the 10th, sea salt was 202 yuan and Lu salt was 190 yuan. In Jincheng, Lu salt was 210 yuan on the 5th. In Jiyuan at the beginning of the month, sea salt was 250 yuan and Lu salt was 220 yuan. In various counties in southern Shanxi, the general price of Lu salt was 50-60 yuan (all per jin).
    Foreign Goods: In the past half month, sugar, matches, and fast indigo declined, paper rose sharply, and all goods were selling quickly. In Hebei-Shandong-Henan, sugar imports from the Yujiakou port flooded in, causing prices to fall in various places. In early October, the price of white sugar at Daokou was 1300-1200 yuan per jin. In Linqing, the price of white sugar fell from 2100 yuan to 1500 yuan since the beginning of October. In Handan, the price of white sugar fell from 1980 yuan to 1600 yuan from the 3rd to the 5th, and the price of red sugar (per jin) fell from 1950 yuan to 1200 yuan. The price of Nanjing matches (per basket) in Handan fell from 74,000 yuan to 70,000 yuan on the 5th, and continued to fall to 66,000 yuan on the 14th. In Linqing, the price fell from 63,000 yuan to 62,000 yuan on the 9th. The price of Qianxin fast indigo (per 5-jin bucket): In Handan, the price fell from 175,000 yuan to 170,000 yuan after the 14th. In Xingtai, the price fell from 220,000 yuan to 185,000 yuan on the 5th. The price of Guangzhi paper (per ream): In Handan, the price rose from 49,000 yuan to 52,000 yuan on the 5th, and rose to 70,000-72,000 yuan on the 15th. In Xingtai, the price rose from 47,000 yuan to 52,000 yuan on the 5th. In Changzhi, the price was 53,000 yuan on the 10th. The price of Fenlian paper (per ream): In Linqing, the price was 46,000 yuan on the 4th and 47,000 yuan on the 9th. In Yangyi, the price rose from 50,000 yuan to 54,000 yuan on the 6th. In Changzhi, the price was 53,000 yuan on the 10th, and the price of newspaper was 150,000 yuan. The largest trading volume of foreign goods was sugar and matches, followed by pigments. The reason for the rise in paper prices is due to the soaring prices in the enemy area. In Tianjin, the price of Fenlian paper had already reached 280,000 yuan on September 15th, rose to 320,000 yuan on October 1st, and the price of newspapers from our factory rose from 450,000 yuan to 600,000 yuan on October 1st.
    II. Import and Export Trade
    Since mid-September, import and export trade in the border area has become active. Trade with Tianjin and Jinan via Linqing and Hengshui is still the most common. In Linqing, in the second half of September, the total value of six kinds of export goods in the first week (September 15-21) was 1,425,530 yuan, with cotton being the largest, with a total export of 103,725 jin, a fourfold increase compared to the previous week, accounting for more than 80% of the total export value, followed by fur, black melon seeds, daylily, and Luo Di. The total value of 18 kinds of import goods was 1,074,080 yuan, with sugar, alkali, and matches being the largest, with more than 11,000 jin of sugar, more than 15,000 jin of alkali, 144 baskets of matches, followed by Fenlian paper, stationery, Chinese and Western medicines, and tea. In the second week (September 22-27), the total export value was 2,055,800 yuan, an increase of about 50% compared to the previous week, with cotton as the main product, with a total export of 129,535 jin, accounting for 79% of the total export value, followed by black sheepskin, and exports of mountain miscellaneous goods, black melon seeds, daylily, etc. also gradually increased. The total import value was 1,438,790 yuan, an increase of about 40% compared to the previous week. Imports were mainly sugar and tea, with these two items accounting for about 30% of the total import value, followed by more than 20,000 jin of alkali. In the first week of October (September 29-October 4), the total export value was 2,312,520 yuan, an increase of about 15% compared to the previous week. Exports were mainly cotton, with a total of 112,230 jin, followed by black melon seeds, etc. The total import value was 1,218,710 yuan, a decrease of about 10% compared to the previous week. Imports were still mainly sugar, matches, and alkali, with sugar accounting for 26% of the total value and matches accounting for 25%. In Hengshui, the main export in late September was melon seeds, accounting for 78% of the total value. Imports were mainly sugar and tea, with sugar accounting for 54% of the total import value and tea accounting for 24%. In addition, the 6th Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan Qiyu traded with Jinan, Puyang, Fengqiu, and Yanjin, and Taihang and Taiyue Ji (Yuan) Meng (County) Baobi traded with Xin (Xiang) Zheng (Zhou). Pingyao Yu (Ci) Tai (Gu) traded with Jiang Yan District, all with trade exchanges, but all were extremely sporadic. In addition to the initial opening of trade between Yong (Ji) Ping (Lu) Yuan (Qu) and the new area of western Henan in southern Shanxi, there is no new development in trade with the Jiang area. In the southern Henan area of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, which is in a guerrilla situation, trade is mainly for daily supply for the military and civilians, and it is difficult to develop foreign trade for a while.
    III. Financial Situation
    Exchange Rate: In the past half month, prices in the Jiang area have continued to soar, and cotton exports from Jinnan have been smooth, which has also rapidly increased the foreign exchange rate. Taking the transaction situation of the Jinnan Linqing Foreign Exchange Exchange as an example, the ratio of the local currency to the Jiang currency was 1:23.8 yuan on October 1, rose to 26.6 yuan on the 5th, rose again to 28.5 yuan on the 10th, and reached 1:31.2 yuan on the 15th. If calculated with the exchange rate of Linqing City on September 30 as the base period, the value of the local currency has increased by about 34.5% in half a month. If compared with the exchange rate on September 16, the value of the local currency has increased by 100% in a month, and the transaction volume of foreign exchange is also huge. In Linqing, the average daily transaction volume in the past half month is about 800 million, but it is still in short supply, so the foreign exchange balance has increased to 1.5 billion to 2 billion. Based on this situation analysis, the future may still rise. Nangong is the second largest foreign exchange market in our region after Linqing. The exchange rate in this area has also gradually declined in the past half month. The ratio of the local currency to the Jiang currency was still 1:20.08 yuan on October 1, and rose to 1:25 on the 5th. Although it once fluctuated and fell back on the 9th, it continued to rise to 27 yuan on the 10th, and as of the 15th, it still hovered around 1:30 yuan, and still showed a rising trend. Hengshui has also risen to over 1:25 yuan since October 10. Comprehensively considering the situation in the entire region, as of October 15, the average exchange rate in the entire region was between 1 yuan of local currency to 20 to 25 yuan of Jiang currency.
    At the same time, the area of circulation of the local currency is also expanding. First of all, in the newly liberated areas of western Henan, such as Xin'an, Mianchi, and Shanzhou, according to the latest reports, the Ji banknotes have been circulating unimpeded and are very popular. The masses automatically devalued the Jiang currency, and the current exchange rate between Jiang currency and Ji banknotes in this area is mostly between 12 yuan and 12.5 yuan to 1. In addition, as our People's Liberation Army crossed the Longhai Railway and went south to Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, the local currency has also begun to circulate in the market and has a very high reputation.
    Gold and Silver Market: The prices of gold and silver yuan have not changed much in the inland market. In Handan, the listed price of gold on the 15th was still 130,000 yuan per tael, and silver yuan was 600; in Nangong, the listed price of gold on the 15th was 160,000 yuan, and silver yuan was 700; in Jincheng, the listed price of gold on the 15th was 120,000 yuan, and silver yuan was 1,000; in Zhangqiu, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the listed price of gold in early October was 100,000 yuan, and silver yuan was 1,000. However, the prices of gold and silver in the border and new areas are higher. In Xinjiang, Ronghe, and Jishan in southern Shanxi, the black market price of gold in early October was around 300,000 yuan, and the black market price of silver yuan was also around 2,000; in Juye and Yuncheng in the 2nd and 7th districts south of the Yellow River in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the market price of silver yuan was mostly between 2,000 and 2,500.
    Exchange Rate between Local Currency and Neighboring Currencies: Bianbi (short for Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Banknote) has become stable. The average price in Hengshui from October 1st to 10th was 1:11 yuan. The listed price in Gaoyi on the 13th was 1:10, and it was also 11 yuan in Nangong on the 15th. Beibi (short for East China Bohai Banknote) is still weak. Except for Linzhang, which once fell to 8.5 jiao per Beibi due to some reason in the previous ten days, it rose back to 1:1 after the 9th. Xibinbi (short for Jin-Sui Northwest Farmer Banknote) remained stable. The price in Qin County, Anze, Changzi, and Tunliu in Taiyue on October 10 was 1:20, and the price in Qinyuan and Pingjie during the same period was 1:16 yuan.
    Counterfeit tickets have also been continuously discovered in Anyang, Yuanshi, Xiajin, and Xinji in central Hebei. According to investigations, most of them come from Shijiazhuang, followed by Jinan and Anyang. However, the printing technology is poor, and the authenticity can be identified if attention is paid.

    棉花：自入十月来棉花销路畅——东线临清濮阳出口顺利，棉价大抬头，冀南冀鲁豫涨势猛，太行太岳尚平。濮阳七日至十二日穰花每斤（加三秤）由七○○元猛升为一○四○元，十五日回到八○○元。临清九日至十二日，每斤由五六○元升为三○元。邯郸六日至十五日大涨，由四六○元升为五五○元，十五日即继升六四○元。邢台月初六○○元，十日降为五六○元，十三日则升为七三○元。在平汉线以西各地均平稳，阳春一日至十五日均为五五○——六○○元。长治上旬六○○元左右。晋城五日七○○元之谱。晋南各地价廉一般则在五○○——六○○元。平陆因系出口地区价昂，上旬七○○——六五○元。蒋区十月来棉价飞腾：济南一日至十二日由一九○万元涨至四○○万元，天津上旬亦达三○○万元之谱，北平一日为三二○万元，徐州十月初二六五万元，上海三四○万元。（以上百斤蒋币计）
    土布：土布一般平稳（六七日以后），因受棉粮价涨之影响、亦逞挺快。濮阳十二日至十五日双尺二四○元平。冀南上旬，广平布每方尺（以下同）二五元，曲周一○五元，南宫一○六元，衡水一○五元，临清一○○元。邯郸七日至十五日每双市尺由二六○元升为二七○元，次布由二一○元升为二三○元。邢台十三日每尺（尺六码）由二一○元升为二三○元。阳邑上半月均为（市斤）一七○○元左右。长治上旬平每尺（尺六码）二四○元左右。晋城五日每市尺高价一五五元，次一三○元。新区平陆价特昂，五日每市尺二六○元。土布在各物中仍为最疲之货，与上月比较，价格相同，惟销路较快。严冬渐临，布可能继续活跃。
    食盐：食盐略同上月，一般平稳，但因受棉粮上升影响，个别地方亦微上提。濮阳七日至十五日一五○元，临清九日前为一○○——九○元，以后升为一二○元。南宫五日至十三日均为一五○元。邯郸六日前为一三○元左右，后升为一三六元，十四日后上等货提到一四八元。邢台十三日由五日之一四五元升为一五五元。阳邑半月米价未变，为一五五——一六○元。长治十日，海盐二○二元，潞盐一九○元。晋城五日潞盐二一○元。济源月初海盐二五○元，潞盐二二○元。晋南各县潞盐一般价在五○——六○元。（均斤计）
    外货：半月来，糖、火柴、快靛下降，纸张猛升，各货均快。冀鲁豫，余家口岸，糖入口涌，故使各地价落。十月初道口白糖每斤一三○○——一二○○元。临清入十月来白糖由二一○○元落到一五○○元。邯郸三日至五日，由一九八○元跌为一六○○元，赤糖（斤）由一九五○元跌为一二○○元。南京火柴（篓）邯郸五日由七四○○○元降为七○○○○元，十四日续跌为六六○○○元。临清九日由六三○○○元，跌为六二○○○元。谦信快靛（五斤桶）：邯郸十四日以后由一七五○○○元降为一七○○○○元。邢台五日由二二○○○○元降为一八五○○○元。有光纸（领）：邯郸五日由四九○○○元，涨为五二○○○元，十五日升为七○○○○——七二○○○元。邢台五日由四七○○○元升为五二○○○元。长治十日五三○○○元。粉连纸（领）：临清四日四六○○○元，九日四七○○○元。阳邑六日由五○○○○元升为五四○○○元。长治十日五三○○○元，报纸一五○○○○元。外货成交量最大者糖、火柴，其次颜料。纸张上升原因是受敌区飞涨影响。天津九月十五日粉连纸已二八○○○○元，十月一日升为三二○○○○元，本厂报纸四五○○○○元，十月一日升为六○○○○○元。
    二、出入口贸易
    九月中旬以来边区出入口贸易见活跃。仍以临清衡水之对（天）津、济（南）贸易为多。临清九月后半月第一周（九月十五——二十一日）六种出口货总值为一四二．五五三万元，以棉为大宗，共出一○三．七二五斤，较前周出口骤增加四倍，占出口总值百分之八十以上，次为皮毛、黑瓜籽、黄花菜、罗底等。入口十八种总值一○七．四○八万元，以糖、碱面、火柴为大宗，糖入口一万一千余斤，碱面一万五千余斤，火柴一四四篓，粉连纸、文具、中西药品、茶叶等次之。第二周（九月廿二——二十七日）出口总值二○五．五八○万元，较上周增加约百分之五十，棉花为主，共出一二九．五三五斤，占出口总值百分之七十九，黑羊皮次之，山杂货、黑瓜籽、黄花菜等出口亦渐增。入口总值一四三．八七九万元，较上周增加约百分之四十。入口以糖、茶叶为大宗，两项占入口总值约百分之三十，其次碱面入口两万余斤。十月第一周（九月二十九——十月四日）出口总值二三一．二五二万元，较上周增加约百分之十五左右。出口以棉花为大宗，共一一二．二三○斤，黑瓜籽等次之。入口总值一二一．八七一万元，较上周减约百分之十，入口仍以糖、火柴、碱面为大宗，糖占总值百分二十六，火柴占百分之二十五。衡水九月下旬出口以瓜籽为大宗，占总值百分之七十八。入口以糖、茶叶为大宗，糖占入口总值百分之五十四，茶叶占百分之二十四。次如冀鲁豫六分区齐禹之向济南、濮阳、封邱、延津与太行太岳济（源）孟（县）薄壁之对新（乡）郑（州），平遥榆（次）太（谷）之对蒋阎区，均有贸易往来，惟均极零星。晋南新区除永（济）平（陆）垣（曲）对豫西新区之贸易初步打通外，对蒋区贸易尚无新的发展。冀鲁豫黄河南则处游击情况下，贸易上以军民日常供应为主，对外贸易一时亦难开展。
    三、金融情况
    汇价：近半月来，蒋区物价继续猛涨，我冀南棉花出口顺利，影响外汇价格亦急速上升。以冀南临清外汇交易所成交行情为例，十月一日本币与蒋币之比为一比二十三元八角，五日升至二十六元六角，十日再升至二十八元五角，十五日更达至一比三十一元二角。若以临清市九月三十日之汇价为基期计算，则半个月中本币币值即上升约百分之三十四点五，试再以九月十六日汇价作比，则一个月来本币币值提高已达百分之一百之谱，外汇成交额亦巨。临清半月来平均每天成交约八亿左右，但仍供过于求，故外汇结存已经增至十五亿至二十亿，据此情况分析，前途恐仍看涨。南宫为我区仅次于临清之第二外汇市场，该地汇价在近半月来亦逐步回旋下降中，十月一日本币与蒋币之比尚为一比二十元零八角，五日即升至一比二十五，九日虽曾一度波动回跌，但十日又续涨至二十七元，至十五日为止，犹徘徊于一比三十元左右，且仍呈挺势。衡水自十月十日起亦已升至一比二十五元以上。综合全区情况，截止十月十五日止，全区平均汇价为本币一元比蒋币二十至二十五元之间。
    同时，本币流通区域亦日益扩大，首先如豫西新解放区新安、渑池、陕州等地，据最近所获报告，冀钞已通行无阻，且极受欢迎，群众自动贬低蒋币币值，现该地以蒋币兑冀钞者多为十二元至十二元五角比一之行情。此外，随着我解放军跨越陇海，南下至豫皖苏以后，本币亦已开始在市面流通，信用甚高。
    金银行情：黄金银元价格在内地市场无大变化。邯郸十五日黄金市平每两挂牌仍为十三万元，银元六百；南宫十五日黄金挂牌十六万，银元七百；晋城十五日黄金挂牌十二万，银元一千；冀鲁豫张秋十月上旬黄金挂牌十万，银元一千。唯边沿与新区金银价较高，晋南之新绛、荣河、稷山十月初黄金黑市均在三十万上下，银元黑市亦两千左右；冀鲁豫黄河南二、七分区钜野、郓城等地银元市价亦多在二千至二千五百之间。
    本币与邻区货币之比价：边币（晋察冀边区钞之简称）转稳，衡水十月一日至十日均一比十一元。高邑十三日挂牌一比十，南宫十五日亦十一元。北币（华东北海钞之简称）仍疲、除临漳前旬因故一度跌至北一比本八角五分，至九日后又回升至一比一。西农币（晋绥西北农民钞之简称）持平，太岳之沁县、安泽、长子、屯留十月十日均本一比二十，沁源、平介同期为一比十六元。
    假票在安阳、元氏、夏津及冀中之辛集等亦续有发现，据查多系来自石家庄，次为济南与安阳，唯印制技术低劣，若加注意即可辨识真假。
