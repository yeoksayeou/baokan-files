Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th. A front-line reporter reports on the battle of Qingjian, stating: After capturing Yanchuan and Yanchang, a unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army turned north, encircling the Kuomintang bandit 76th Division, which was entrenched in Qingjian city. The surrounding mountains, spanning over twenty square kilometers around the city, were dotted with fifty-seven large and small bunkers. At 4:00 PM on the 6th, our army began its assault on these bunker complexes. Despite the continuous autumn rain that night and the next day, our troops captured twenty bunkers in succession. By the 9th, the outer bunkers were almost completely cleared, leaving only the Bijiashan bunker complex, standing to the west of the city, which controlled the entire city. This mountain had extremely difficult cliffs to climb, and enemy reinforcements had already arrived from Yan'an. Therefore, on the morning of the 10th, our army launched a fierce attack on Bijiashan, with the artillery team concentrating its firepower from all sides for cover. After an hour of intense fighting, Bijiashan was captured, and the defending enemy of two companies was taken prisoner. The enemy reinforcements were also met with our successive interceptions, preventing them from advancing. At 9:40 PM that night, our besieging army launched a general assault, breaking through the east and west city walls seventy minutes later, pouring into the city. Street fighting continued throughout the night, and at 5:00 AM the next morning, the enemy division headquarters was captured, and its commander, Liao Ang, and over a thousand others were captured alive. Before dawn, another unit of our army also broke into the city from the northwest, engaging in street fighting. As dawn broke, the defeated enemy soldiers scurried in all directions, seeking places to hide. Our brave soldiers pursued and captured the remaining enemies street by street, alley by alley. The participating masses, active around the city and on the walls, witnessed this eagle-catching-chickens style search and could not help but applaud and cheer. The battle ended victoriously at 6:00 AM. At this time, the enemy reinforcements were still thirty miles away from the city, within sight but out of reach, but Liao Ang no longer needed "reinforcements." Qingjian city fell on March 31st of this year. The enemy 76th Division, which had invaded and occupied the city, was originally stationed in Baoji and had "pacified" the people's guerrillas in the Linyou mountain area, and had intruded into our Longdong sub-district. Last year, when General Wang Zhen's troops broke through from the Central Plains, detoured through southern Shaanxi and returned to the border area via Longdong, this enemy was responsible for blocking them, but was repeatedly defeated by our army. In February of this year, Liao Ang was the chief commander of the attack on our border area, and the 76th Division he led was the first to attack the Guanzhong and Longzhong sub-districts, occupying our Malan, Qingyang, and other places. In March, when the enemy launched a large-scale attack on Yan'an, the division invaded Yanchuan, Yanchang, Qingjian, and Wayaobao from the Jinpenwan line southeast of Yan'an. Wherever the beastly army went, it burned, killed, looted, and committed all kinds of evil, earning the people's deep hatred. This time, the prisoners, including Liao Ang, were escorted along the way, and the masses cursed them with gnashing teeth. The New 1st Brigade of the division was nearly wiped out during the attack on Yan'an. Later, it was transferred to western Henan for replenishment. On the 17th of last month, it was completely annihilated by our Chen-Xie army in Lingbao. The 430th and 431st regiments of the 144th Brigade of the division were successively defeated in battles south of Jiaxian and in Penkou. Now the brigade has been reorganized. With the annihilation of the division headquarters and its 24th Brigade this time, Hu Zongnan's direct line, the 76th Division, is finished.

　　攻克清涧战斗经过
    【新华社西北十六日电】前线记者报导攻克清涧战斗经过称：西北人民解放军一部在攻克延川、延长后，挥戈北指，将龟缩清涧城之蒋匪七十六师团团包围。该城四周二十余方公里的重重山峦上，满布着五十七个大小碉堡。六日下午四时我军开始向这些碉堡群进行攻击战。是夜及次日虽秋雨绵绵，我军仍连克碉堡二十个。至九日外围碉堡几全扫清，仅余矗立于城西按制全城之笔架山碉堡群。此山悬崖绝壁攀登极难，而敌援兵已由延安赶来，我军乃于十日晨强攻笔架山，神炮队亦由四面集中火力猛轰掩护。经一小时激战，攻下笔架山，守敌两连全部就俘，而敌援军亦遭我节节阻击，不能前进。是夜九时四十分，围城我军发动总攻，于七十分钟后突破城东西墙垣，涌入城内，巷战彻夜，于翌晨五时攻入敌师部，活捉其师长廖昂以下千余人。拂晓前，另部我军亦由城西北突入城内，展开巷战。当黎明来到时，敌溃兵向四处乱窜，寻觅躲藏之所，我健儿即逐街逐巷追捕残敌。活动于城周及墙垣上之参战群众，目睹此老鹰捉小鸡式的搜索战，莫不拍手叫好，呐喊助威，六时战斗胜利结束。此时敌援兵尚离城三十余里，可望而不可及，但廖昂已不需要“援”了。清涧城系于今年三月三十一日沦陷，侵踞该城之敌七十六师原驻宝鸡，曾“清剿”麟游山区人民游击队，进扰我陇东分区。去年我王震将军所部由中原突围经陕南绕道陇东回边区时，该敌曾负责阻击，屡为我军所败。今年二月廖昂为进攻我边区之首届指挥官，其率领之七十六师首先进攻关中、陇中分区，占我马栏、庆阳等地。三月敌大举进攻延安时，该师由延安东南金盆湾一线侵陷延川、延长、清涧及瓦窑堡等地。兽军所到，烧杀劫掠，无恶不作，人民恨之入骨。此次廖昂等俘虏在押送途中，沿路群众莫不切齿痛骂。该师之新一旅在进攻延安时被我歼灭近一个团，后调至豫西补整，上月十七日在灵宝被我陈谢大军完全歼灭。该师一四四旅之四三○及四三一两个团先后于葭县以南及盆口战斗中被我击溃，现该旅已被改编。此次该师师部及其二十四旅被歼后，胡宗南的嫡系七十六师就此完蛋。
