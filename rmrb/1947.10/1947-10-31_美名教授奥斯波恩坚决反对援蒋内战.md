　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. New York dispatch: Professor Osborne of the Teachers College of Columbia University published a lengthy letter in the New York Times on the 26th, opposing the U.S. military and economic aid to Chiang as requested by warmonger Bullitt, Mr. Cole, the head of the U.S. Congressional inspection group who recently visited China, and Mr. Hotson, the President of the American Theological Seminary. Mr. Osborne had lived in China for ten months as a child welfare consultant. Mr. Osborne pointed out that "Chiang Kai-shek should bear the primary responsibility for the civil war and the current situation in China. Chiang Kai-shek's rule has turned China (referring to the KMT-controlled areas) into a police state." There is no possibility of improving the situation as long as Chiang Kai-shek remains the head of state. We (referring to the United States) supporting the current Chinese (Chiang) regime is supporting a reactionary and dictatorial government. Mr. Osborne said: "American aid with strict supervision (meaning aid with the condition of destroying China) will not be accepted by the Chinese people." Mr. Osborne pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek launched the civil war and is unpopular. "The Kuomintang is being defeated by the Communist Party. As long as the masses of people in the Communist-controlled areas feel that they benefit more from being under Communist control than under the Kuomintang control, the Kuomintang army will not be able to win."

　　美名教授奥斯波恩坚决反对援蒋内战
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】纽约消息：美哥伦比亚大学教育学院教授奥斯波恩二十六日于纽约时报发表长信，反对战争贩子布立特，最近来华之美国会考察团团长柯尔及美国神学院院长候森等人所要求的美国军事经济援蒋。奥氏曾在中国留住十月，担任儿童福利顾问。奥氏指出“蒋介石应负内战及目前中国情况的主要责任，蒋介石统治已将中国（指蒋管区）变为警察国家”，只要蒋介石仍旧是国家的首脑，便无改善情况的可能。我们（指美国）支持目前中国的（蒋）政权，便是支持一个反动独裁的政府。奥氏说：“有严密监督（按即附有灭华条件）的美国援助将非中国人民所愿接受”。奥氏指出：蒋介石发动内战不得人望，“国民党正为共产党所败。只要共产党地区的人民大众感觉着他们从共产党控制下得的好处多于国民党控制，国民党的军队将不能取胜”。
