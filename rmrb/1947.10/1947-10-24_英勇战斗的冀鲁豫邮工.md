　　Heroic Battle of the Jilu Yu Postal Workers
　　Su Tang
　　After the fall of the counties south of the Yellow River in Jilu Yu, the enemy completely blockaded the natural barrier of the Yellow River and the village roads. Postal work suffered greatly. Dozens of postal workers were captured and killed, including Director Lu of the Jining Bureau, Section Chief Lin Zhenghua of the Seventh Branch Bureau's business section, and postal worker He Dengkui from Jiaxiang. Comrade Wang Dezhou of the Second Station was even buried alive. In such a difficult environment, our postal workers relied closely on the masses and persisted in their fighting posts.
　　Comrade Wang Dongliang of the District Bureau crossed the Yellow River three times to establish contact for the postal route of the Third and Fifth Sub-districts. Inspector Shan Rongzhi traveled at night and rested during the day. He had just returned from contacting Shandong and, without resting for a minute, crossed the Yellow River again to find the First Sub-district. He couldn't ride his bicycle, fearing the enemy would hear, so he carried documents on his back, shouldered the bicycle, climbed over four mountains, and didn't close his eyes for two days and nights. Li Tongxuan, a postal worker from Yuncheng and Juye, encountered the enemy in the Seventh District. Fearing being heard, he took off his shoes and ran barefoot to complete his mission. Han Shide of the Third Branch Bureau delivered express mail, covering 220 li back and forth in one day and night. Li Mingzhen from Ningyang, fearing he would not arrive on time because he left late, ran so fast that he became dizzy and blacked out, falling to the ground and only waking up after an hour. This shows their dedication to punctuality and care for the mail.
　　It became commonplace for postal workers to set out in the rain and to set out continuously, and they all traveled at night. Postal workers in Juye set out continuously four times in a row. Zhao Fu'en, a postal worker from the Second Station, traveled 280 li in two nights, breaking the record for breaking through the blockade. Comrade Zhang Qiji insisted on setting out even while suffering from diarrhea, and he also ran 140 li through the blockade line in one night. Under the feet of our brave and tenacious postal workers, the enemy's so-called blockade line has been trampled into ruins.
　　In the guerrilla environment, postal workers were mostly equipped with weapons, because each time they set out, it was a struggle for life and death. It was rare for them not to encounter the enemy on the way. Li Xue and others from the Fifth Branch Bureau encountered the enemy on the way to Caoxian. They rushed forward and dispersed the enemy with a volley of gunfire, capturing a machine gun and two prisoners. Meng Fan and Peng Yunmin, postal workers from Jiaxiang, encountered the enemy on the way to the county government. After the assault, they captured five prisoners and one gun. In addition, Zhang Qifeng of the Second Station broke through three times to complete his mission, braving machine gun fire to deliver documents; wartime postal service persisted and developed in this life-and-death struggle.
　　They are not only postal workers, but also armed work teams and experts in psychological warfare to disintegrate the enemy. Yan Xizhen and Sun Yongchang from Ningyang accompanied the army to the enemy-occupied area, and they had to reach the county connection 90 li every day. In their busy schedule, they paid attention to propaganda and investigation, writing blackboards and spreading news of victory. When the night march passed through enemy-occupied villages, they wrote slogans and posted good news along the villages. Postal workers in Feicheng often followed the armed work teams to be active in enemy strongholds, posting leaflets and newspapers to disintegrate the enemy, and even posting newspapers on the south gate of the city to conduct psychological warfare.
　　In the struggle, they relied closely on the masses and always thought of the people. For example, postal workers in Caoxian, like the troops, proposed the "three not leaving" movement. In Dingtao, they not only dug tunnels themselves to persist in the struggle, but also helped the masses dig when they had time. In Feicheng, they helped the masses push 40 carts of soil in one afternoon. Helping to carry water and rush to harvest and plant was even more common. Director Ma of Dingtao, Director Li of Fucheng, and others, led all the staff to repel the enemy, selflessly protect the masses, and cover the transfer of the organs. Therefore, the masses also risked their lives to protect them. For example, Chen Lianfa, a postal worker from Linze, was captured by the enemy. He pretended to be visiting relatives, but the enemy didn't believe him. Fortunately, an old lady firmly believed that he was her nephew, so he was able to escape. When Comrade Du Tongjie, a postal worker from Yanjin, was surrounded by the enemy, he lost all his personal belongings, but pulled out the bureau's mule, believing that personal belongings didn't matter, but revolutionary wealth could not be lost. This spirit of hard struggle has been constantly praised by the District Party Committee, the Prefectural Party Committee, and the counties. For example, the Second Prefectural Committee praised: "Our postal service has gone from isolation to being opened up, from being opened up to being rapid... The quality of wartime transportation has a great relationship with leadership... Even the persistence of the guerrilla war in Henan is directly related...".

　　英勇战斗的冀鲁豫邮工
    苏塘
    冀鲁豫黄河南各县沦陷之后，敌人即将天险黄河及村庄道路完全封锁，邮务工作也遭受到极大的迫害与摧残，邮务人员前后被俘及枪杀者，即有济宁鹿局长、七分局业务科长林征华、嘉祥邮工何登坤等数十人，二站王得周同志更惨遭活埋。我邮政员工在这样艰苦的环境中，紧紧依靠群众坚持着自己的战斗岗位。
    区局王东亮同志，曾为三五分区邮线，三下黄河打通联系。巡视员单荣芝夜行昼宿，刚从山东联系回来，一分钟未休息即又东渡黄河去找一分区，自行车不能骑，怕敌人听见，就身背文件，肩扛自行车，爬过四座山，两昼夜未合过眼。郓、钜邮工李同选到七区遇敌，怕听见，脱鞋赤足飞奔，完成任务。三分局韩世德送快信，二百二十里，一天一夜打来回。宁阳李明振因出发晚了怕不能按时到达，快跑如飞，头晕眼黑，栽倒在地，一句钟方醒来。丰县师宗海送文件昼夜奔跑，梦中还大声说：“快看看文件对不对，别丢了”。遵守时间爱护邮件之情可见一斑。
    邮工们冒雨出发、连续出发已成常事，而且都是夜行。钜野邮工一次连续出发四回之多。二站邮工赵福恩两夜连走二百八十华里，打破冲过封锁线的最高纪录，张其江同志一面泻肚一面还坚持出发，而且一夜也跑了一百四十里的封锁线，在我英勇顽强的邮工脚下，敌人的所谓封锁线，已被踏的残缺破烂。
    在游击的环境中，邮工们大都配有武器，因他们每次出发，都是一个生死的斗争，中途不遇敌人时候太少了。五分局李学等二人到曹县途中遇敌，他们冲上去一排枪将敌击散，缴机枪一、俘敌二。嘉祥邮工孟繁、彭云民到县府，中途遇敌，冲击结果，俘敌五、缴枪一。此外如二站张其峰三次突围完成任务，迎着机枪弹雨钻进去送文件；战时邮政即在此生死斗争中，坚持并开展起来。
    他们不仅是邮工，而且是武工队、是攻心战瓦解敌军的能手。宁阳阎西真、孙永昌随军出发敌占区，与县连系九十里每天要到，他们在百忙中注意宣传调查写黑板报传播胜利消息，夜行军过敌占村则沿村写标语、贴捷报。肥城邮工更经常随武工队活跃敌据点中，张贴传单报纸瓦解敌人，甚至一直把报纸张贴到城南门上，进行攻心战。
    在斗争中他们紧紧依靠群众，处处为人民着想，如曹县邮工与部队一样的提出三不走运动。定陶不但自己挖地道坚持了斗争，而且有空即帮助群众挖。肥城一下午即帮群众推土四十车。帮助挑水抢收抢种更是普遍。定陶马局长、复程李局长等，都曾率领全局员工，击退敌人，奋不顾身保护群众掩护机关转移，因此群众也舍生忘死地掩护他们，如临泽邮工陈连法遇敌被俘，假装看亲戚，敌不信，亏一老太太坚认为自己外甥才得脱险。延津邮工杜同杰同志被敌包围时，私人东西丢光，却将局内骡子拉出，他认为私人东西没关系，革命财富不能丢。这种艰苦奋斗的精神，受到区党委、地委、各县的不断表扬。如二地委表扬说：“我们的邮政是由隔绝到打通，由打通到迅速。……战时交通好坏对领导关系很大……甚至对河南游击战争的坚持都是有直接关系的……”。
