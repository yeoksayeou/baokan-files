Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Committee and Other Organizations
  Enthusiastically Help the Masses with Harvesting and Planting
    [Report from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan office on the 16th] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Committee, the Administrative Office, the Yellow River Committee, and other organizations, all cadres and staff, are working intensively to assist the masses in the villages where they are located with the autumn harvest and planting. Cadres and staff of the District Party Committee organs set aside appropriate time each day to help with the autumn harvest, especially in the afternoon, when everyone goes to the fields to help with the urgent harvesting and planting. The Administrative Office held a meeting of production team leaders on the 4th of this month, and initially summarized the production situation of the past ten days. Everyone was in high spirits. In the past few days, when chopping corn stalks and cutting mung beans, they could not find sickles, so they pulled them out by hand. When it rained and they could not work in the fields, they went to the homes of the common people to husk corn. According to incomplete statistics, during the four days of rain, a total of 133 workdays were contributed, harvesting 55 mu of crops. In recent days, they have been helping the masses deliver manure, dig land, and plow the fields. In addition to using the organs' livestock to help plow the land, they also organized digging teams and plowing teams, which set off every day to work for military dependents, revolutionary martyrs' families, and poor people. The masses are very happy. Like Zhang Lao Wu said, "If you hadn't helped me, I would have planted three mu less wheat this year!" An old man surnamed Ma, when the comrades finished working for him, grabbed them and wouldn't let go, affectionately saying, "No one can leave, come to my house for soup!" Aunt Zhang insisted on stuffing dates into the comrades' arms, saying, "You are really my loved ones!" An old lady whose family was helped by the guards said, "You only eat two meals a day, but you put in so much effort, all for us poor people!" Saying that, she shed tears. The entire 27 members of the Cultural Work Troupe helped the village where they were stationed harvest 34 mu of mung beans, 36 mu of corn, and more than 10 mu of millet. In addition, they did some odd jobs such as hauling manure. On the 7th and 8th, they pulled seeders and rollers to help the masses plant wheat, planting more than 100 mu of wheat in two days. The Yellow River Committee also helped the local masses with the autumn harvest a month ago. The autumn crops around its驻地 have been mostly harvested. During the autumn harvest, even Directors Wang and Zhao, in their extremely busy work, took time to go to the fields to harvest. The cadres responsible for the autumn harvest find the village cadres every day to discuss how to help military dependents who lack labor and lonely elderly people. The organs' livestock also help the masses plow the land. The CPC Puyang County Committee, the County Government, the Finance Committee, and the Public Security Bureau cadres and staff helped the families of those supporting the front with the autumn harvest and wheat planting. County Secretary Sun got up at dawn to cut beans for the Shen Chao Xing family, who was supporting the front. He didn't rest for a moment except for eating. He and two communication officers cut six mu in one day, and stacked it in the field when it got dark. Comrade Wang Shichun, secretary of the County Party Committee, also went to cut beans for the Shen Chao Xing family who supported the front, even though he was ill. A group from a certain department of the county government, together with women and children from Zhang You Tou Village, led by Women's Section Chief Liu Yumei, worked together. The women and children cut while shouting and making noise, and their morale was extremely high. A wide piece of land was quickly finished. In the evening, it was counted that 52 cadres and staff of the organs cut 71.5 mu of beans in one day, pulled seeders to plant 2.3 mu of wheat, pulled rollers for 4.5 mu, raked bean leaves for 16.5 mu, delivered four carts of manure, and helped pull 12 carts of beans, stacking beans on 5 mu. Now, everyone is still enthusiastically helping the masses with the autumn harvest and wheat planting.
