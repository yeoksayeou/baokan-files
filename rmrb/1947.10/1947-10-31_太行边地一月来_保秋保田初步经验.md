　　Taihang Border Region in the Past Month
　　Initial Experiences in Protecting Autumn Harvest and Farmland
　　Wang Boying
　　Based on the victory of the summer harvest struggle, the guerrilla warfare for protecting autumn harvest and farmland in our border region's new districts is getting more and more vigorous. From the beginning of September to the beginning of October, in eleven counties including Taigu, Qixian, Yuci, Yuanshi, Huolu, Anyang, Tangyin, Qixian, Jiaozuo, and Xiuwu, according to incomplete statistics, the militia fought no less than two hundred battles, killing and wounding 934 Chiang and Yan bandits, capturing 101, seizing 7 machine guns, 7 small cannons, 120 rifles, 5 short guns, 1 submachine gun, 3,232 rounds of ammunition, 179 hand grenades, 6 boxes and 60 rounds of artillery shells, 2 pairs of binoculars, 8 bayonets, recovering 20 livestock and more than 500 *shi* of grain for the masses, and covering the masses to harvest more than 7,000 *mu*, This fire of guerrilla warfare for protecting autumn harvest and farmland is burning vigorously behind enemy lines, smashing the Chiang bandits' ruling order to pieces, undermining the bandits' grain grabbing plan, and victoriously kicking off the prelude to the autumn distribution and land distribution. The achievement of this result mainly comes from the following experiences:

　　(1) The enemy advances, we advance; the enemy does not advance, we also advance. Actively attacking the enemy, satisfying the local people's demands for grain and land, destroying the ruling order of Chiang and Yan, and pushing the autumn distribution and land distribution movement behind enemy lines are the main keys to carrying out the guerrilla war for protecting autumn harvest and farmland. Because the masses behind enemy lines in the new districts have been cruelly oppressed by the Chiang and Yan bandits for a long time, the lives of the peasants are extremely sad, so their desire for land and grain is the most urgent; but they have concerns (fearing that the situation will change, fearing retaliation and sneak attacks from landlords). As long as their concerns are eliminated, they will work bravely and directly. Various localities seized this link, with company soldiers as the backbone, combined with militia work teams, and a large number of activists, formed armed turn-over teams, adopted the form of "stars all over the sky" armed activities, and pushed into the enemy's rear. Military activities and political offensives were carried out simultaneously, scaring the enemy. The enemy hid in the bunkers and dared not move. Then, spies were captured, the enemy's eyes and ears were eliminated, and the autumn and land distribution movement was launched vigorously.

　　(2) Closely combining protecting autumn harvest and farmland with the autumn distribution and land distribution. Judging from the autumn harvest struggles in eleven counties including Anyang, Qixian, Qixian, Jiaozuo, and Yuanshi, to do a good job in rushing harvest, it is necessary to combine it with the autumn distribution and land distribution. This is the main feature of this year's autumn harvest struggle. Where this link is grasped, the autumn harvest and farmland protection movement will be vigorously launched. When the rush harvest began, various localities adopted the policy of "first strike wins", put forward the slogan "Rather eat one less bite, than lose a whole mouthful", and mobilized cadres and the masses. On the basis of everyone clarifying the idea that grain is the lifeline, they rushed to harvest and distributed autumn grain and land. For example, in Shangzhuang and Xiyuke villages in Yuanshi, on the one hand, the fruits of the struggle were distributed well, and on the other hand, they cooperated with the armed turn-over team to rush harvest in Mochi, and the two villages distributed 300 *mu* of land, and recovered more than 60 *mu* of autumn crops under artillery fire. Dazhaiji and Zhengsi villages in the Third District of Ye County, on the one hand, rushed to harvest, on the other hand, distributed more than 50 *shi* of grain and more than 300 packages, and Bijicun Village gathered all the poor households and distributed more than 80 *shi* of millet, and the enthusiasm for doing things immediately increased. Twenty-four villages east of Shahe, in addition to distributing autumn grain and farm tools, also distributed 3,695 *mu* of autumn fields. The masses were extremely excited. Immediately, 29 poor hired workers joined the militia and actively worked to protect the autumn harvest and farmland, fighting with the enemy day and night.

　　Because the people's demand for grain and land was met, the people's enthusiasm for rushing to harvest was extremely high. Generally speaking, the organization and form of rushing to harvest are divided into three types according to the region: The first type is the area under the enemy's bunkers. In this area, a lean and small armed force is organized to rush to harvest at night; the second type of area is one or two *li* away from the enemy's strongholds or places where the enemy often comes out to disturb. In this type of area, the armed forces protect the rush harvest, and the young and middle-aged are organized into a rush harvest team to rush to harvest day and night; the third type of area is farther away from the enemy's strongholds. In this type of area, the whole village of men, women, old and young form a large rush harvest team, scientifically dividing the labor, with women and children cutting, young and middle-aged carrying, and the elderly threshing, and carts transporting to the rear; the second is to absorb the past masses or family members and local masses to form a mutual aid rush harvest team, and the harvested grain is divided according to three-seven or four-six; the third is that the rear organizes a rush harvest team (manpower and animal power) to support the front-line areas. For example, Zhao Village and four or five other villages in Yuanshi organized a rush harvest team of 100 young adults and 89 carts to participate in rushing to harvest the autumn crops of landlords in the Silianzhuang village near the railway. They recovered more than 410 *shi* of grain in two days. No matter what kind of area, it is carried out under armed cover.

　　(3) Carrying out mass explosions everywhere is the best tactic to defeat the enemy. To attack the Chiang and Yan grain grabbing teams, in addition to hitting their heart and eliminating their eyes and ears, it is more important to carry out a mass explosion movement, making it appear real and unreal, burying mines everywhere in the fields, road intersections, streets, doorways, windows, and boxes, which not only inflicts heavy casualties on the enemy, but also threatens them spiritually, making the enemy's morale even lower. For example, the Chiang bandits in Huolu went to our Sanzhai and Liangjiazhuang to grab grain. They stepped on a landmine on the well platform in Shangzhai and wounded an enemy. There was a mine on the door of Liangjiazhuang, and the enemy dared not enter the house. They used a two-zhang long pole to detonate six of them, scaring the enemy so much that they dared not do anything and retreated in a hurry. The enemy said in fear: "I am afraid of eating black eggs (referring to landmines) when I set out." For example, the Yan bandits in Yuci twice raided Yuchengping to grab grain. The masses studied the enemy's law of grabbing grain, and set up landmines in places such as the doorway, the grain location, under the urn, and fake grain storage cellars. They killed 46 enemies in two times. The Zhuangzi village estimated that the enemy would rummage through boxes and cabinets, so they buried a mine under the box. They also estimated that the enemy would use a mat to roll up the body after being killed, so they hung a mine under the mat. Sure enough, an enemy was killed under the box, and two people came to use the mat, and two more were killed. After that, they never dared to grab grain again. After the landmine exploded and killed the enemy, it was widely spread to carry out a propaganda offensive, creating an enemy phobia of mines, not only making the enemy explode wherever they go, but also making the enemy fear landmines in their dreams.

　　(4) Under the centralized leadership of one yuan, we must unify our strength, unify our organization, and strive for unity in thought and action. Especially the turn-over and autumn protection team composed of battalion soldiers, militiamen, work teams, and activists should be a trinity, support each other, and solve difficulties for each other. In this way, a powerful iron fist to defeat the enemy is formed.

　　太行边地一月来
  　保秋保田初步经验
    王伯英
    在夏收斗争的胜利基础上，我边地新区保秋保田的游击战争越搞越起劲。从九月初至十月初的一个月中，太谷、祁县、榆次、元氏、获鹿、安阳、汤阴、淇县、焦作、修武等十一县，据不完全统计，民兵作战不下二百次，毙伤蒋、阎匪九百三十四名，俘一百零一名，缴获机枪七挺，小炮七门，步枪一百廿枝，短枪五枝，冲锋枪一枝，子弹三千二百三十二发，手榴弹一百七十九颗，炮弹六箱又六十发，望远镜两付，刺刀八把，夺回群众牲口二十头，粮食五百多石，掩护群众抢收七千多亩，这一保秋、保田游击战争的烽火如火如荼的燃烧到敌后，把蒋匪的统治秩序打得个七零八落，摧垮了匪徒们的抢粮计划，胜利的揭开了分秋分田的序幕，这一成绩的获得，主要有如下几点经验：
    （一）敌进我进，敌不进我也进，主动打击敌人，满足当地群众要粮、要土地的要求，摧垮蒋、阎统治秩序，把分秋分田运动推向敌后，是开展保秋保田游击战争的主要关键。由于新区敌后群众长期受蒋、阎匪帮的残酷压榨，农民的生活是极其悲痛的，所以他们要地、要粮的心情最迫切；但有顾虑（怕变天、怕地主报复打黑枪），只要剔除其顾虑，他们便勇猛直前的干起来。各地抓住这一环节，以营兵为骨干，结合民兵武工队，以及大批极积分子，组成武装翻身队，采取了满天星武装活动形式，推向敌后，在军事活动和政治攻势双管齐下，吓怕了敌人，敌人藏在碉堡里动都不敢动，接着就捕捉奸特，打掉了敌人的耳目，分秋、分田的运动，就猛烈的开展起来。
    （二）保秋、保田和分秋分田紧密相结合，从安阳、祁县、淇县、焦作、扎元氏等十一个县的保秋斗争来看，要想抢收搞得好，必需要与分秋分田结合起来，这是今年秋收斗争中的主要特点，那里掌握了这一环节，那里的保秋保田运动就会猛烈的开展起来。当抢收一开始，各地都采取了先下手为强的方针，提出“宁叫少吃一口，不叫满口都丢”的口号，动员了干部群众。在大家明确了粮食是命根的思想基础上，一面抢收，一面分秋分田。如元氏上庄、西于科两村，一面把斗争果实分配好，一面配合武装翻身队到墨池抢收，两村分了三百亩地，并在炮火下抢回六十多亩秋禾。邺县三区大寨集、正寺等村一面抢收，一面分了粮食五十多石，包袱三百多个，壁集村召集了所有的贫户分了八十多石谷子，马上干的劲头就大起来。沙河以东二十四个村分了秋粮、农具外，还分了三千六百九十五亩秋田，群众的情绪异常兴奋，马上有二十九个贫雇参加了民兵积极的为保秋保田，白天黑夜的与敌人干起来了。
    由于满足了群众的要粮、要地的要求，所以群众的抢收情绪极其高涨。一般说来，抢收的组织与形式根据地区划为三种：第一种是敌碉堡下的地区，在这一地区是组织精干的小型武装，夜晚突击抢收；第二种地区是距敌据点一、二里或敌人经常出扰的地点，在这种地区，是以武装掩护抢收，把青壮年组成抢收队，日以继夜抢收；第三种地区是距敌据点稍远的地区，在这种地区，组成全村男女老少的抢收大队，科学的分工，妇女、儿童割、青壮年担，老年人打场，大车向后方运送；其次是吸收过去的群众或家属和当地群众互助组成抢收队，收回之粮食按三七或四六分，再者是后方组织抢收队（人力畜力）支援前沿区。如元氏赵村等四、五个村组织了一百青壮年和八十九辆大车的抢收队，到铁路边的四联庄等村参加抢收地主的秋禾，两天便收回四百一十多石粮食，不论那种地区都是在武装掩护下进行的。
    （三）到处开展群众性的爆炸，是制胜敌人的最好战法，打击蒋、阎抢粮队，除挺向其心脏打掉其耳目外，更重要的是开展群众性的爆炸运动，虚虚实实，田里、道口、街上、门头、窗户上、箱柜里到处埋雷，不但予敌人杀伤大，并且在精神上的威胁，使敌士气更加不振。如获鹿蒋匪到我三寨、梁家庄抢粮，走到上寨井台上踏响一颗地雷炸伤一敌，梁家庄门上有雷，敌不敢进家，用两丈长的杆子撞响六颗，吓得敌人不敢动手，慌忙退走，吓的敌人说：“出发就怕吃了黑鸡蛋（指地雷）。”又如榆次阎匪两次突击榆城坪抢粮，群众研究了敌人抢粮的规律，就在门口，粮食地点、瓮底下，假造的藏粮窑等处大设地雷，两次就炸死敌四十六人。庄子村估计敌人要翻箱倒柜，就在箱下埋上雷，又估计敌人炸死后，要用席卷尸体，就在席下挂雷，果然箱下炸死一敌，两人来用席，又炸死二名，以后再不敢来抢粮，当地雷炸敌后，就广为传播，开展宣传攻势，造成敌人恐雷病，不仅使敌走到那里雷炸到那里，并且要使敌人在睡梦中也是惧怕地雷。
    （四）要在一元化的领导下，统一力量、统一组织、思想上行动上求得一致，特别在营兵民兵武工队以及积极分子组成的翻身保秋队，应是三位一体的、互相支援、互相解决困难，这样便形成了痛击敌人的一有力铁拳。
