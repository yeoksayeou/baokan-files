Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. The Canadian reactionary government, acting as a running dog for U.S. imperialism by selling 150 bombers to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to slaughter the Chinese people, has aroused strong opposition within Canada. According to a TASS report from Ottawa on the 26th, the Toronto branch of the Canadian Social Democratic Party has lodged a serious protest with the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs regarding this matter. The protest stated: The Canadian government's unilateral aid to the Kuomintang government constitutes interference in China's civil war, undermining the foundation of peace in Asia and the world, and running counter to the United Nations Charter. The Toronto branch of the party also firmly advocated that the Canadian government's action be brought before the United Nations Security Council. Furthermore, Dr. Endicott of Canada recently denounced the Canadian government's policy of aiding the Kuomintang government and interfering in China's civil war at a rally in Toronto.

  　反对以飞机售蒋
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】加拿大反动政府甘做美国帝国主义的走狗，以轰炸机一百五十架售与蒋家匪帮屠杀中国人民一举，已在加拿大国内激起强烈反对。据塔斯社渥太华二十六日电报导，加社会民主党多伦多区分部已为此向加政府外交部长提出严重抗议。该抗议书内称：加政府这种片面援助国民党政府的行动，构成了对中国内战的干涉，破坏亚洲与全世界和平的基础，与联合国宪章背道而驰。该党多伦多区分区并坚决主张将加政府此一行动向联合国安全理事会提出。又，加拿大恩地科特博士日前曾在多伦多集会上，痛斥加政府援助国民党政府干涉中国内战政策。
