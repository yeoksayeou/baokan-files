  　How Can Such a Bandit Army Not Be Annihilated?
  　A Glimpse of the End of the 57th Division
    During the continuous rains of August, the 57th Division paraded through the mud. They wrapped themselves in all the cotton clothes and bedding they could find from the common people, even wearing women's "leather covers" for making shoes, with one eyelet around their necks. As soon as they entered a village, they drove the common people into the courtyard to stand in the rain, while they relieved themselves indoors, defecating in pots and flour vats. When warming themselves by the fire, they specifically chose tables, chairs, chests, and cabinets to burn. Other farming tools and clothing that they could carry, they took away; those they could not, they completely destroyed. What the common people resented most was rape; in every village they stayed in, young women were rarely spared. All of this was done under the instructions and condoning of their superiors. As for the men, they were all taken away; some had their civilian clothes torn off and were immediately forced into military uniforms. The number of people captured is truly impossible to count. In the Shatuji campaign, more than 1,600 conscripts from Yunju Sixth District alone were liberated by our army. The conscripts who were captured, under the enemy's brutal behavior, devised various ways to resist. Some wanted military uniforms, stole things, and ran back; those who could not run back even rose up to help our army fight in the Shatuji battle. Ma Yi, a peasant from Liuzhuang in Yunju First District, carried bullets to our position when the enemy retreated. Yu ×× from Yulou in the Sixth District carried a machine gun back to our army on the front line. His left arm was also injured. In addition, seven nameless heroes took advantage of the situation in a courtyard to capture three enemies and seize a machine gun. The enemy's brutality aroused unstoppable anger in the local area. When the masses saw our cadres, they all complained bitterly and demanded revenge. Cases of the masses killing individual Chiang soldiers were also common. An ×× from Luozhuang in Yunju Sixth District used a pole to knock an enemy unconscious and take back a stolen donkey. With the coordinated actions of our army and the people, the 57th Division was completely annihilated in Shatuji, truly venting a grievance for the people of the entire district. When the long line of prisoners passed through Yunju Sixth District again, the masses, seeing that these were the very guys who had ravaged them, were all red-eyed and demanded to pull out the criminals who had committed atrocities in their villages to take revenge; it was only after the explanation of our escorting troops that they were allowed to pass. Xu Hai, an old lady from Fangzhuang, grabbed a prisoner wearing a woman's jacket and refused to let go, wanting to get her own jacket back. An old man from Fangzhuang said, "The day I was captured, walking with him for two li, I saw that this team was about to be finished!"

　　冀鲁豫通讯
  　这样的土匪队伍怎么能不被歼灭
  　五十七师末日小景
    在八月的连日霪雨中，五十七师在泥泞中大游行。他们把从老百姓那里所能找到的棉衣被套都裹在身上，甚至把女人做鞋用的“革被”也穿一个眼套在脖子上。一进村，先把老百姓赶到院子里去在雨中淋着，他们却大小便都不用出屋门，屙在锅里、面缸里。烤火时就专找些桌、椅、箱、柜等来烧，其余农具衣服等物能带的带走，不能带的完全捣毁。最叫老百姓恼恨的是奸淫，凡住过的村庄，青年妇女很难幸免。这都是在其长官指示纵容下做出来的。对男人则是全部带走，有的当即将便衣撕坏换上军装；被抓的数目真是无法统计。沙土集战役中，仅郓巨六区被我军解放的壮丁就有一千六百多人。被抓去的壮丁在敌人如此残暴行为下想出各种办法进行抵抗，有的要军装穿上偷些东西跑回来，不能跑回来的在沙土集战斗中还起来帮助我军作战。郓巨一区刘庄农民马义，在敌退却时担着子弹跑到我们阵地中来。六区于楼于××在火线上扛回一挺机枪交给我军。他左臂也负了伤。另有七位无名英雄，在一个院子内乘势拢跑三个敌人，夺了一挺机枪。敌人的残暴，给当地更激起不可抑止的愤怒。群众见了我们干部都沉痛诉苦，要求报仇。群众中杀死个别蒋军人员的事亦屡见不鲜。郓巨六区罗庄安××用杠子打晕敌人，夺回被抢的驴子。在我军民协同动作下，五十七师在沙土集被全部歼灭了，真是为全区人民出了一口冤气。当长长的俘虏行列又经过郓巨六区时，群众看到这些就是曾经蹂躏过他们的家伙，都眼红了，纷纷要求拉出曾经在本村行凶的罪犯报仇；在我押送部队解释下，才通过了。六区徐海一个老太太抓住了一个穿女人褂子的俘虏，死也不放，要把自己的褂子要回来。房庄一个老头说：“那天把我抓去时，跟他二里地，我就看到这个队伍快完蛋了！”
