　　Yangcheng Masses Show Comfort to Military Families During Mid-Autumn Festival
　　[This article was] transmitted by Taiyue [Correspondent] on the 3rd. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, men and women in front of the homes of military families in Yangcheng are busy. The Mid-Autumn Festival comfort activities in Chengguan Town have changed the old routine, focusing on preferential treatment, so as to ensure that military families live better. The masses in Dongguan Village gave 200 jin of coal to each of the 54 military martyrs' families and honorably discharged soldiers. Shunxing Village provided one day of manure hauling for 31 military martyrs' families. The mutual aid groups of cadres in Xiguan visited military martyrs' families and honorably discharged soldiers, and wrote labor guarantee letters to the families. The families happily said, "This is good, this is good?!" In addition, the masses voluntarily brought gifts, like visiting relatives, to the homes of military martyrs' families to deliver coal, or invited military families to their homes for dumplings and reunion wine. Gao Tianfu, a man in his fifties or sixties, enthusiastically held a plate full of persimmons and red fruits and personally delivered gifts to the family of military member Song Dexi. The two old men met and couldn't stop smiling. Dexi hesitated for a long time before saying, "You all come to give me gifts, where am I going to put them!" Wang Hongyou, a chef, made four plates of fragrant dishes and sent them to a military family. He said with a smile: "In the past, we offered sacrifices to the moon, but now we have overthrown superstition and no longer offer sacrifices to the moon. But military families are our 'living moon'. If there were no children of military families fighting Chiang Kai-shek, how could we have these bright days? Today we will offer sacrifices to this 'living moon'!" After this enthusiastic comforting of the troops, military family member Mao Tianyuan said with emotion: "Although I am sixty years old, I can still do the work of a full laborer. I don't need everyone's preferential treatment, I want to help others!" Many military families busily wrote letters to their children or husbands on the front line. Yu Jinlai said in his letter to his son Yu Ming: "In the past, we picked up sheep manure to make a living, endured hunger and starvation. Now we have turned over, we have land, the golden millet has been threshed for us by the masses, and it has filled three or four large jars. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, people came to give us labor guarantee letters to plant wheat for us! I am really happy, you fight Lao Jiang well! If Chiang Kai-shek is not killed, our good days will not be guaranteed!" At the same time, various places comforted the troops on the front line. Wang Zhenfu, a primary school student in the Fifth District, said: "I can't join the army, I will send 500 yuan to the soldiers at the front, to capture Chiang Kai-shek alive as soon as possible!" Female student Ma Furan (a military family member) donated a pair of shoes and 800 yuan. Eleven teachers and students donated a total of five pairs of shoes and 6,700 yuan. Female student Wei Lanying said: "Although there are not many things, it is like sending goose feathers from a thousand miles away, the gift is light but the affection is heavy!"
