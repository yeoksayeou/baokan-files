Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 27th: After the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang openly shot and killed Mr. Du Bin-cheng, a famous educator and leader of the Democratic League in Northwest China, people from all walks of life in the Northwest were filled with grief and indignation upon hearing the news. General Zhao Shoushan, a friend of Mr. Du during his lifetime, recently issued a statement to reporters, saying, "Chiang's spokesperson, Dong Xian-guang, said that Mr. Du instigated General Kong Congzhou's uprising. I can say with certainty that General Kong's uprising was not instigated by Mr. Du, but was the result of Chiang's despicable means of eliminating miscellaneous troops." General Zhao continued to analyze the reasons for General Kong Congzhou's uprising, saying, "In March of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), Chiang employed the tactic of nominally promoting but actually demoting General Kong, transferring him from the commander of the 50th Division to the empty title of deputy commander of the 38th Army, while transferring his subordinates to Gongxian, western Henan, and in May, Chiang again dispatched eighteen trucks to forcibly transport his soldiers to various places for piecemeal assimilation. He even attempted to force General Kong to lead all officers to the Officers' Training Corps for training, in the hope of wiping them out in one fell swoop, thus arousing General Kong Congzhou's uprising." At this point, General Zhao rose angrily and asked rhetorically, "Isn't Chiang Kai-shek's rumor-mongering trick too naive and ridiculous? When Congzhou revolted in Gongxian, Mr. Du was being monitored in Xi'an by Chiang's secret agents. How could they communicate with each other? It is clear that this is Chiang's excuse for killing democrats, a habitual trick to confuse the public, and not worth refuting." General Zhao continued, "I have known Mr. Du for many years. Mr. Du was simple and upright, the typical embodiment of the people of Northwest China. He never even smoked a cigarette, yet Chiang's bandits slandered him as smoking and selling opium. The shamelessness and baseness of the rumors have reached this point!" General Zhao pointed out that Chiang had been plotting to kill Mr. Du for a long time, and had attempted to assassinate him twice in the 34th and 35th years of the Republic of China (1945 and 1946), but failed. Now that the people of Shaanxi are rising up in resistance under Chiang's traitorous, dictatorial, and internal war tyranny, Chiang killed Mr. Du with the aim of strengthening the suppression of the Shaanxi people's resistance, vainly attempting to maintain his collapsing rule. Finally, General Zhao said firmly and confidently, "Mr. Du's death is a powerful call to the people of Northwest China: only by fighting to Nanjing and capturing Chiang Kai-shek alive will the people of Northwest China have the freedom and security to survive. Mr. Du is dead, and his relatives and friends, including myself, will rise up to avenge him. The people of Northwest China will also rise up to seek justice for him."

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 27th: Mr. Yang Mingxuan, a famous educator in Northwest China and former Director of the Education Department of Shaanxi Province, expressed deep grief and indignation over the murder of his classmate and old friend, Mr. Du Bin-cheng, and issued a statement on the matter. Mr. Yang first revealed Chiang's persecution of Mr. Du over the years, saying, "As early as the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), when Mr. Du was a member of the Kuomintang Shaanxi Provincial Government, he was considered 'problematic' by Chiang because he was close to young students. Chiang secretly instructed secret agents to search his residence and arrested his orderly, Du Liangming, and subjected him to torture in an attempt to fabricate charges against Mr. Du as a cruel excuse, but the result was not as desired. From then on, Mr. Du voluntarily resigned from his post and had no relationship with the Chiang Party. However, Chiang knew that Mr. Du had a high reputation among the people of Northwest China, and thus vainly attempted to use Mr. Du as a tool to harm the people of Northwest China. Chiang first instructed Chiang Dingwen and Hu Zongnan, the Chiang bandits' chairmen of Shaanxi Province, to win him over, and even personally took action to play tricks, but Mr. Du was never exploited, and sternly criticized Chiang and Hu's crimes. Seeing that the attempts to win him over had failed, Chiang turned to thoughts of murder. In the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), Chiang instructed secret agents in Xi'an to secretly arrest and kill him, but the plot failed because it was discovered by Mr. Du. This time, he adopted the most despicable and vicious means to kill Mr. Du." At this point, Mr. Yang said with indignation, "Mr. Du's spirit will forever live in the hearts of the people of Northwest China. The death of one Du Bin-cheng will result in the emergence of thousands and tens of thousands of Du Bin-chengs. We will continue to fight to the end with a firm and unyielding spirit for the liberation of the Great Northwest, and we must give Chiang the justice he deserves to comfort Mr. Du's heroic soul."

　　蒋家匪帮诬杀民盟杜斌丞氏
  　赵寿山氏等痛斥蒋贼
    指出不除蒋贼西北人民无生存保障
    【新华社西北二十七日电】西北名教育家民盟西北负责人杜斌丞先生被蒋介石匪帮公开枪杀后，西北各界人士闻耗，莫不悲愤万分。杜氏生前友好赵寿山将军顷向记者发表谈话称：“蒋贼代言人董显光说杜先生煽动孔从周将军起义，我可断言孔将军之起义并非杜先生所煽动，而是蒋贼消灭杂牌军卑劣手段逼迫的结果。”赵将军继分析孔从周将军起义原因称：“民国三十五年三月，蒋贼采用明升暗降手段，蒋孔将军从五十师师长调任三十八军空头副军长，而将其部下调至豫西巩县，五月蒋贼复派遣十八辆卡车强将其士兵分运各地各个蚕食。并图迫孔将军率领所有军官至军官训练总队受训，以期一网打尽，遂激起孔从周将军起义。”至此赵将军愤然起立反问说：“蒋介石的造谣伎俩未免太幼稚可笑，当从周在巩县起义时，杜先生被蒋匪特务监视于西安，怎么可以互通消息呢？由此可见此乃蒋贼杀害民主人士之借口，混淆世人耳目之惯技，不值一驳。”赵将军继称：“我和杜先生相处多年，杜先生为人朴直，是西北人民典型的化身，从来纸烟都不吸一口，而蒋匪却诬蔑其吸食与贩卖鸦片，造谣之无耻卑劣，一至于此！”赵将军指出蒋贼蓄意杀害杜氏为时已久，在民国三十四年及三十五年曾两度企图加以暗杀未遂，目前蒋贼在陕西人民不堪其卖国独裁内战虐政下纷起反抗之际杀害杜氏，目的显在加强镇压陕西人民反抗，妄图维持其行将灭亡的统治。最后赵将军坚定而充满信心地说：“杜先生的被害对于西北人民是一个有力的号召：只有打到南京去活捉蒋介石，西北人民才会有生存的自由与保障。杜先生死了，他的亲朋连我在内，都会起来为他报仇，西北人民亦将奋起为他伸冤。”
    【新华社西北二十七日电】西北著名教育家、前陕西省教育厅长杨明轩老先生，对其同学及其老友杜斌丞氏被害深表悲愤，并特就此事发表谈话。杨老先生首揭露数年来蒋贼压害杜氏经过称：“远在民国三十一年杜氏任国民党陕西省政府委员，即因接近一般青年学生被蒋贼认为‘有问题’，而暗中指使特务搜查其住宅，并将勤务员杜梁明捕去严刑拷打，企图捏造杜先生罪状，作为残酷借口，结果未逞所欲。从此杜先生即自动辞去职务，不与蒋党发生关系。但蒋贼深知杜先生在西北人民中威信甚高，从而妄图利用杜氏为其残害西北人民的工具，曾先后授意蒋匪陕西省主席蒋鼎文、胡宗南进行拉拢，甚至亲自出马大耍手段，但杜氏始终不受利用，并以严正态度指责蒋胡罪恶。蒋贼见拉拢失败，乃转萌杀机。民国三十四年蒋贼曾指使西安特务暗中捕杀，因被杜氏发觉，阴谋未逞，这次竟采取最卑鄙恶毒手段将杜先生杀害”。杨老先生至此愤激的说：“杜先生的精神永远活在西北人民心中，杀死一个杜斌丞将会有成千成万个杜斌丞出现，我们将继续以坚毅不屈的精神，为大西北的解放事业奋斗到底，一定要给蒋贼以正义的惩办，以告慰杜先生的英灵。”
