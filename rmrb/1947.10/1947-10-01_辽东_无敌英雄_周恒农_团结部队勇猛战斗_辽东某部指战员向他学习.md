Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 29th -- In the midst of intensive military training and land reform education, a unit of the Liaodong Democratic Allied Army is carrying out a "Invincible Hero" Zhou Hengnong campaign, calling on everyone to learn from Zhou Hengnong's combat style. In the "Zhou Hengnong's Deeds" booklet printed and distributed by the unit, it emphasizes Zhou Hengnong's three major strengths: his idea of serving the people and his spirit of heroic combat; uniting fraternal troops, implementing policies, and conducting political work on the battlefield. This movement is now developing among all commanders and fighters.

"Invincible Hero" Zhou Hengnong is from Gaotang, Shandong, and is currently 23 years old. At the age of 18, he was forced into the puppet army by the puppet Baochang and suffered all kinds of abuse. After our army liberated Gaotang the year before last, Zhou immediately joined the People's Liberation Army, determined to seek revenge. He is usually brave and courageous in combat and has extremely friendly enthusiasm towards the soldiers. In the Tangshuntun battle in February last year, Zhou rescued two wounded comrades and the platoon leader under intense enemy artillery fire, ensuring that not a single comrade was lost on the battlefield. In the battle to defend Xiaohuangou, near Linjiang, the company was responsible for defending the high ground. At that time, the cold wind was biting, and food supplies were difficult, so the soldiers had complaints. He explained to the soldiers, "Comrades, don't we often say that we must persist in fighting under difficult circumstances? Now is the time of hardship, and this is glorious. Without hardship, there would be no great victory." Then he said, "If we don't hold this hill, we won't be able to eliminate the enemy." After his repeated explanations and encouragement, the soldiers' fighting morale was improved, and they finally completed the task victoriously. After the Democratic Allied Army annihilated the 272nd Regiment of the enemy's 195th Division in the area, the enemy fled in panic. The troops took advantage of the victory to pursue, ordering Zhou Hengnong's squad to serve as the vanguard. He led his squad sixty li overnight on both water and dry roads. When he arrived near Yimianjie, he found that there were enemies in the nearby mountains and villages. Zhou was not afraid at all and bravely led his brothers into the village, immediately capturing more than thirty enemies. During the continued pursuit, when attacking another village, Zhou Hengnong, under the cover of the platoon leader's machine gun, bravely rushed towards the enemy with another soldier, grabbed the enemy's abandoned machine gun, and swept the street, forcing the enemy to flee into the courtyard. Finally, he captured more than 120 enemies, killed the deputy commander of the enemy's 195th Division, and seized a 60mm mortar, six machine guns, and more than thirty rifles. The next day, the squad was assigned the task of demolition. As soon as the battle started, they destroyed the enemy's blockhouse. The defending enemies fled in panic around the breach. Zhou Hengnong surrounded the wall and shouted: "Those who surrender their weapons will not be killed!" More than thirty enemies then raised their guns and surrendered. The unit immediately awarded him a special merit and a silver five-star invincible medal. From then on, Zhou Hengnong won the glorious title of "Invincible Hero."

  　团结部队勇猛战斗
  　辽东某部指战员向他学习
    【新华社东北二十九日电】辽东民主联军某部在紧张练兵与土改教育中，开展“无敌英雄”周恒农运动，号召大家学习周恒农的战斗作风。该部在印发的“周恒农事迹”小册子中，着重指出周恒农为人民服务的思想与英勇战斗精神；团结兄弟部队，执行政策与在战场上进行政治工作等三大优点，这个运动现正在全体指战员中发展着。
    “无敌英雄”周恒农为山东高唐人，现年廿三岁，十八岁时被伪保长逼迫送入伪军，受尽各种虐待，前年我军解放高唐后，周即加入解放军，决心报仇。他平时作战果敢英勇而且对战士有极高的友爱热情，去年二月唐山屯战役中，周在敌猛烈炮火下，抢救负伤的战友与班长两名，保证战场上不丢一个彩号。在保卫临江小荒沟战斗中，该连担任高山防守，当时寒风入骨，粮食供应困难，战士都有牢骚，他便向战士们解释说：“同志们，我们不是常说在艰苦情况下要坚持战斗吗？现在正是艰苦的时候，这是光荣的，没有艰苦就没有大的胜利”紧接着又说：“我们要不守住这个山头，就不能消灭敌人”。经过他的反复解释与鼓励，战士们的战斗情绪提高了，终于胜利的完成任务。民主联军在该地歼敌一九五师二七二团之后，敌狼狈逃窜，部队乘胜追击，命令周恒农这一班担任尖兵，他带了他这个班一夜赶了六十里水旱路，到了一面街附近，发现附近山上与村内都有敌人，周毫不畏怯，勇敢的率领全班弟兄打打入该村，当即俘敌三十余名。在继续追击中攻入另一个村庄时，周恒农在排长机枪掩护下，与另一个战士勇猛的冲向敌人，抢起敌人丢落的机枪顺街扫射，压逼敌人逃入院子，最后俘敌一百二十余人，击毙敌一九五师副师长一名，并缴获六零炮一门，机枪六挺和步枪三十余支。次日该班担任爆炸任务，战斗开始即炸毁了敌人炮楼，守敌狼狈地围绕缺口逃窜，周恒农少敏的包围了围墙，并进行喊话：“交枪不杀”，三十多敌人便举枪投降了。该部当即记他特功一次，并授银质五星无敌奖章一枚，从此周恒农就获得了“无敌英雄”的光荣称号。
