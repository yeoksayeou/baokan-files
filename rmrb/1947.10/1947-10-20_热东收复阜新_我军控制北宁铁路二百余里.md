　　Eastern Rehe Recaptures Fuxin
　　Our Army Controls Over 200 Li of the Beining Railway
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 18th] After capturing Xinlitun, a stronghold in western Liaoning, a unit of the Democratic Allied Army continued its offensive on the 17th and captured Fuxin County, an important industrial center in eastern Rehe, and the important stronghold of Xinqiu in one fell swoop. It annihilated a regiment of the remnant of the 50th Division (reorganized from the Security Zone Brigade) of the Chiang bandits' local army, and a portion of other troops. The battle results are still being verified. Note: Fuxin City is the eleventh city recovered by us in the autumn offensive.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 16th] Since the People's Liberation Army launched a major sabotage campaign on the Beining Railway, the Chiang bandits' lifeline for the civil war, in late last month, this blood vessel for the Chiang bandits' civil war in the Northeast has been completely paralyzed. At present, our People's Liberation Army has controlled over 200 li of railway lines between Shanhaiguan and Suizhong, Suizhong and Xingcheng, and Dahushan and Xinmin. We have captured more than ten important railway station strongholds between Shanhaiguan and Suizhong, including Qianwei, Wanghutun, Qiansuo, Huangdi, Gaoling, Wanjiatun, Lijiapu (20 li northeast of Shanhaiguan), Qiantunweizhen, and Shiheqiao; nearly ten important stations between Suizhong and Xingcheng, such as Shahousuo, Dongxinzhuang, and Baitangsi; and several places between Xinmin and Jinzhou, such as Baiqibao, Raoyanghe, and Gaoshanzi. In total, we have captured 40 station strongholds from Shanhaiguan to Xinmin, annihilated and captured all of the No. 204 train of the 3rd Battalion of the Iron Armored Train Corps of the Chiang bandits' Ministry of National Defense, and more than 1,000 members of the puppet security police. We have destroyed more than 100 bunkers along the line, more than 20 iron bridges, burned 156,000 railway sleepers and 16,000 railway tracks, and seized countless field guns, mountain guns, supplies, ammunition, food, and other materials. The sabotage campaign is still developing.
