　　[Report from our newspaper in Huguan] In Huguan City, among the 85 shops and 485 workers and shop assistants, there are 92 feudal elements, big and small. For example, the big secret agent Qu Taishan is the manager of the Zhixingcheng shop of the Production Department of the county government. Therefore, the masses are afraid, feeling that he has connections in the county government. They fear that they cannot squeeze him out, and they fear that the county government production will collapse. Some say: "If we want to squeeze him, we must first get through to the government." Also, Ma Quanxing, Zhang Quanzhong, and others are managers and accountants in the Veterans' Wood Factory and the Cultural Society. People are afraid that squeezing them out will harm the veterans and others. Under these circumstances, the comrades leading the work in the city gave the masses support, saying: "Only when our workers and shop assistants unite can we squeeze out the feudal elements wherever they are hiding. Public and private shops belong to our people, and we cannot let secret agents and feudal elements control them." County Magistrate Wang also personally came out to express his attitude and support the masses, saying: "The government and the masses will work together to squeeze out the feudal elements." In this way, the masses became bold and vigorous in their actions ideologically.

　　At the beginning, they seized upon the turned-over peasants among the workers and shop assistants as the backbone, enlightened their class consciousness, and asked: "Have we completely turned ourselves over? Have we completely eliminated feudalism?" Let everyone discuss it. For example, coal worker Wang Zhanyuan said: "We must draw a clear line with the feudal elements and resolutely not be middlemen." Then the workers and shop assistants launched a movement to tell their sufferings and state the facts. For example, textile workers of Zhixingcheng said: "Qu Taishan deducted workers' wages. The organization originally stipulated that we should weave more than two zhang of cloth per day, earning four and a half cun of cloth (wages) for each zhang. If we weave more than three zhang of cloth, we would earn five cun of cloth per zhang. We were very enthusiastic, and we could weave more than three zhang with a wooden machine and more than four zhang with an iron machine every day, but he calculated our wages at an average of four cun of cloth per zhang, and he also provoked the relationship between our workers and the government. At the same time, during the land reform movement, he hid two landlords and secret agents, Guo Shuize and others, and sent them to Xinxiang, and kept 44 jin of landlord cotton and 114 jin of flavored salt, preventing the masses from turning over." For example, the workers of the Veterans' Wood Factory said: "Secret agent Ma Quanxing said that workers are born to be oppressed. Even good mules and horses have to be beaten. If any worker makes trouble, hand him over to me. He also deducts our food expenses, recording one jin when we eat half a jin, and only gives us 18 workdays when we work for 20 days. Workers are also restricted from attending meetings, such as scolding: 'A stinking worker goes to meetings every day,' etc...." After enlightenment and telling of sufferings, the masses raised their awareness, and finally squeezed out the feudal landlords.

　　壶关城内挤封建
    王志献
    【本报壶关讯】壶关全城大小商店八十五户，工人店员四百八十五人中藏有大小封建九十二人，如大特务璩太山在县府生产部商店志兴成任经理，因此群众害怕，觉着人家在县府吃的开，怕挤不掉又怕把县府生产挤垮台，如说：“咱要想挤，得先给政府弄通”。又如马全兴、张全中等都在荣军木工厂和文化社任经理会计等职，挤了人家又怕荣军等不行。在这种情况下，领导该城关工作的同志给群众撑腰说：“只有咱们工人店员团结起来，封建钻在那里咱们就挤在那里，公私商店都是咱老百姓的，不能让特务封建掌握”。王县长也亲自出来表明态度，给群众撑腰，说：“政府群众一齐动手把封建挤清。”这样群众在思想上才胆大而猛烈的干起来。
    开始抓住工人店员中在农村的翻身群众为骨干，启发他们阶级觉悟，提出：“咱们翻透身了没有，封建消灭透了没有？”让大家讨论，如煤工王占元说：“咱们要和封建划清界线，坚决不能当中间人。”接着工人店员展开诉苦摆事实运动，如志兴成纺织工人诉说：“璩太山克扣工人工资，机关原定我们每天织二丈布以上，每一丈赚布（工资）四．五寸，织三丈布以上每丈赚布五寸，我们情绪很高，每天用木机能织三丈多，用铁机能织四丈多，但他却把每丈布给我们平均按四寸算了，并挑拨我们工人和政府的关系。同时在土改运动中，隐藏郭水则等地主特务两名放往新乡，保藏地主棉花四十四斤，味盐一百一十四斤，不让群众翻身。”又如荣退军人木工厂工人说：“特务马全兴说，工人是天生受压迫的东西，好骡好马还要打过来哩，那个工人捣蛋交给我管，并克扣火食，我们吃半斤他就记一斤，做工二十天只给十八工，工人去开会也得受限制，如骂：‘一个臭工人每天去开会’等……。”经过启发诉苦，群众提高觉悟，终于才把封建地主挤掉了。
