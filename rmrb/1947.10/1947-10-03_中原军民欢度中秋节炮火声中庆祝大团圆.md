Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 1st. The military and civilians in the Dabie Mountains celebrated the Mid-Autumn Festival amidst the sounds of gunfire. That morning, the troops stationed in various villages were busy grinding flour, milling rice, and purchasing wine, meat, vegetables. During the meal, they invited local people to celebrate the festival with them according to the food unit, eating reunion dinners. In the evening, military-civilian get-togethers were held, and everywhere was filled with the close unity of the military and civilians celebrating the festival together. Many villagers stationed in the villages even rushed to grind the newly harvested glutinous rice to make glutinous rice dumplings and soup to comfort the wounded. When the villagers who had been stationed by the Central Plains Military Region troops last year sent glutinous rice to the troops to celebrate the festival, they said: "Last year, the New Fourth Army and the Eighth Route Army helped us plant seedlings here, without even smoking a cigarette. By the time of harvest, they had already left. This year, the troops have returned to counterattack and fight the reactionaries, and also helped the common people harvest rice. Our sending this little gift is just a small token of our appreciation." At a party, Old Man Liu, who had been a land commissioner fifteen years ago, said excitedly: "Since you left, we haven't had a good festival once. It's been more than ten years, and this is the first time. Now the Old Fourth Army, the Red Twenty-seventh Army, the New Fourth Army, and the Eighth Route Army have all returned. This is truly a great reunion. From now on, the common people will always have good festivals."

　　中原军民欢度中秋节炮火声中庆祝大团圆
    【新华社中原前线一日电】大别山区军民于炮火声中欢度中秋佳节。该日午前，各村驻军均忙着磨面碾米，采买酒肉蔬菜，会餐时按伙食单位请驻地群众过节，吃团圆饭。晚间并举行军民联欢会，到处洋溢着军民一家共度佳节的亲密团结气象。好多驻村群众，并赶碾新收下的糯米作成糍粑汤丸，慰劳伤员。去年曾驻过中原军区部队的村庄，群众于送糯米给驻军过节时说：“去年新四军、八路军在这里帮我们插下了秧，连烟都没吸一支，到收割时已走了。今年队伍回来反攻打反动派，还帮忙老百姓割稻子，我们送这点礼物算是一点小意思。”在一个联欢会上，十五年前当过土地委员的刘老汉，异常兴奋的说：“自从你们走后，我们没有过过一次好节气，十几年了，今年是第一次，现在老四军、红二十七军、新四军、八路军都回来了，真个是大团圆。今后老百姓将永远过好节气了”。
