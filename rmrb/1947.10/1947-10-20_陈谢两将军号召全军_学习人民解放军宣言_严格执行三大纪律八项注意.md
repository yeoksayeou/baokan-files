　　Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E, 18th -- Generals Chen Geng and Xie Fuzhi have recently signed an order calling on the entire army to deeply study the Chinese People's Liberation Army Headquarters' Double Tenth Declaration, and to strictly enforce the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. The order begins by stating: The Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention are one of Chairman Mao's fundamental principles for building a people's army, and are one of the main markers distinguishing the people's army from all Kuomintang troops. A special call is made for in-depth study and thorough implementation in order to further strengthen ourselves, unite the masses, and strive for victory. The order then specifies three key points for study: First, all army cadres, in addition to memorizing them, should engage in discussion, deeply reflect, and correct any tendencies towards warlordism that detach them from the masses, tendencies towards departmentalism that disregard the overall situation, and tendencies towards liberalism that are careless and perfunctory. Second, all soldiers, participating militia, and laborers should be given in-depth education, memorizing the content, learning the songs, understanding each point, and treating it as the main content of the squad's review meetings. New soldiers should memorize and understand the content within ten days of enlistment, and liberated soldiers should do so within fifteen days of enlistment. Third, military and political leaders and political organs, in addition to setting an example and resolutely implementing these rules, should regularly test and check the degree of implementation among their subordinate cadres, soldiers, participating militia, and laborers. Those who resolutely implement them will be rewarded, while those who do not memorize them or violate them will be criticized and punished. The order concludes by issuing five temporary regulations based on the situation of the troops after operations in newly liberated areas: (1) Latrines must be dug at residences, and urination and defecation must not be done arbitrarily. (2) Doors should be put back on, straw should be laid on the beds, and cleaning should be done. (3) Temples must not be demolished, and schools must be protected. (4) Propaganda should be carried out when entering and exiting. (5) No errands may be requested without the approval of the political organs.
