　　Overcoming Procrastination and Waiting
  　Shangguan Zhongyou's Joint Brigade Rushes to Plant Counter-Offensive Wheat
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 22nd] The Yan'shan, Jide, and other six-village joint brigade, led by Yangcheng labor hero Shangguan Zhongyou, overcame ideological obstacles to changing stubble wheat and vigorously changed stubble, planning to finish planting before the frost season. Initially, everyone had the following negative thoughts about planting wheat: that after the rain, there were a few days of wind and cold weather, and some people thought that planting would not be possible, showing slackness; some areas were delayed and waited because the stream water was high and they could not enter the fields; others were eager to "get by immediately" due to this year's poor harvest, planning to solve the difficulties through transportation, and were indifferent to planting wheat. Therefore, the leaders of each village held meetings of mutual aid team leaders successively on the 11th to discuss that planting more "counter-offensive wheat" was a political task, as important as fighting a war. Ensuring that everyone has food to eat means that they can fight a war. Therefore, everyone's enthusiasm and creativity were improved, and they proposed guarantees for planting more "counter-offensive wheat." The Lin Zhizhong team of Jide Village immediately guaranteed to plant 45 mu more, and the old man Li Yuhang went into the field barefoot and opened a ten-zhang-long ditch to divert the stream water, so that plowing and planting could be advanced. Under the personal leadership of Shangguan Zhongyou in Yan'shan, they started early and worked late, rushing to plant with all their strength. The Shang Xiaozhen team busily delivered manure from morning till night, sending three more loads than usual. Yuanxing Village planted one mu of wheat more per person, planting 700 mu in the whole village, Hujia planted 300 mu more, and Jide planted 200 mu more. All other villages planted more than last year.

　　克服拖延等待思想
  　上官中有联合大队抢种反攻麦
    【本报太岳二十二日电】阳城劳动英雄上官中有领导的岩山、吉德等六村联合大队，克服改茬麦的思想障碍，大力改茬，计划霜降前全部种完。开始大家对种麦有这几种消极思想：即雨后刮了几天风，气候很冷，有些人认为种不成了，表现松懈；部分地区则因涧水大，不能进地，拖延等待；又有的因今年歉收，急于“现过现”，计划从运输中解决困难，对种麦冷淡。因此各村领导上便于十一日，先后召开互助组长会议，讨论出多种“反攻麦”是政治任务，和打仗一样重要，保证大家有吃，就能打仗，因此提高了大家的积极性与创造性，纷纷提出多种“反攻麦”的保证。吉德村林智中队当场保证多种四十五亩，李玉行老汉，赤脚进地开了十丈长的水濠，把涧水引出，可以提前犁种。岩山在上官中有亲自带头下，起早搭黑，全力抢种，上小真组紧张的从早到晚一直送粪，比平常多送三回，元兴村每人多种一亩麦，全村种七百亩，护驾多种三百亩，吉德多种二百亩。其他各村，都比去年多种。
