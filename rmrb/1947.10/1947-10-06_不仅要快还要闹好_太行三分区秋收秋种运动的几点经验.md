　　Not Only Fast, But Also Do It Well
  　Some Experiences in the Autumn Harvest and Planting Campaign in the Third District of Taihang
    Su Bo, Pang Hong
  　(1) Launching Ideological Mobilization Combined with Rectification of Mutual Aid to Carry out a Full-Scale Assault:
    According to materials from various regions, the development of the autumn harvest and planting campaign in the Third District has yielded the following experiences:
    First, it is necessary to conduct widespread ideological mobilization from top to bottom and from bottom to top. In this regard, we should start from two aspects. First, we should carry out ideological mobilization based on the masses' experience of surviving the famine, so that the masses can establish the idea of getting rich and preventing famine from recalling the famine and understanding the current disaster situation. They should break the historical tradition of planting less wheat or not planting wheat, and plant a large amount of wheat. For example, in Lujiazhuang, First District of Changzhi, which suffered from ice and wind disasters, the autumn crops suffered heavy losses. After mobilization, everyone said, "In 1943, planting wheat saved people's lives," and the whole village expanded wheat fields by more than 800 mu. Su'dian Village broke the idea of ​​despising wheat planting such as "one mu of garden is equal to ten mu of field" and "Changzhi does not grow wheat", and expanded wheat fields by more than 1,000 mu. Secondly, based on the masses' idea of ​​expanding wheat fields, we should guide the masses to understand the urgency of this year's farming season, the busyness of life, and the current disaster situation (especially the recent wind and hail disasters). Through life arrangements and precise calculations, the masses can clearly realize that autumn harvest and autumn planting must be not only fast, but also done well. For example, after ideological mobilization in Changzhuang Village, Fourth District of Lucheng, it will be a busy month. We must rush to do the autumn plowing in one breath.”
    Second, on the basis of ideological mobilization for the autumn harvest and planting campaign, various regions have universally carried out rectification of mutual aid and labor organization. First, the original mutual aid was rectified, mainly in the following types: 1. The mutual aid groups that were organized by coercion were boldly dissolved, and the hands were freed to combine voluntarily. For example, Licun Gouliang Madou in Lucheng called on everyone: "Talk about conditions and meet minds." Truly make mutual aid based on free and voluntary combination. 2. For those whose mutual aid collapsed due to the accumulation of problems, the work and accounts were cleared, and the current debts were paid, and the legacy issues were resolved, and the principle of equivalence was implemented. For example, in a large group in Machang Village, Lucheng, because the wages were unclear, everyone was dissatisfied and unwilling to cooperate again. After a large calculation, 59 laborers all started working together again. 3. Appropriately arrange life, scientifically divide labor, and rationally use strength. For example, in Beiliu Village, Licheng, after discussions in various groups, nine life arrangement and division of labor methods were formulated, and labor and livestock were appropriately divided, which greatly exerted the intensity of labor. The life that originally required 13 days was completed in 9 days. 4. Mobilize the experience of drought resistance and sowing, break through the scope of the group, and implement large-scale work changes. For example, Nanmazhuang in Lucheng, after rectifying the foundation of group mutual aid, implemented large-scale work changes to overcome labor difficulties. In addition, various regions have also organized a large number of semi-auxiliary labor forces into production with mutual aid as the core. Experience has proved that only by organizing semi-auxiliary labor forces in large numbers can the land be planted faster. As the masses in Beiliu, Licheng, said: "One woman can't do it, but two women are equal to a man." Women, children, and old men have all been involved in production, greatly exerting the power of organization. Linghou Village, Third District of Lucheng, organized men, women, old and young to work together, and 473 mu of regular wheat were all planted within 4 days. In short, only by closely combining the rectification of mutual aid and the organization of semi-auxiliary labor can the difficulty of insufficient labor be overcome.
    Through in-depth ideological mobilization and labor organization, the current autumn harvest and planting campaign has entered a tense stage. In addition to planting the regular wheat, most areas have quickly turned to assault the autumn harvest and a large amount of catching up with wheat. For example, Licheng proposed "planting regular crops, planting replanting crops, harvesting and planting together, harvesting and plowing together." Lucheng proposed: "Cut and harvest as you go, harvest and plant as you go, and make every effort to突击 (tu ji) without leaving a single idle person." Changzhi proposed: "Carry out the three-over-fire movement of cutting one piece when it turns yellow and planting one piece as it is cut."
    (2) Grasp Tightly, Do It Quickly, and Do It Well.
    Through ideological mobilization and labor organization, the autumn harvest and planting campaign has quickly developed in various regions. After the campaign has started, how to correctly grasp and lead the campaign is a very important issue. In this regard, according to our experience in突击 (tu ji) planting wheat, we propose the following two points for the current autumn harvest and wheat-catching campaign:
    First, at the beginning of the campaign, our leaders and the masses must clearly recognize that this year's autumn harvest and planting campaign is in a situation of early frost and early freezing, tight farming season, and busy life. Therefore, the autumn harvest and planting campaign itself must be closely integrated. In the leadership's grasp and the development of the campaign, it is necessary to require "grasping tightly and doing it quickly." Otherwise, a little slack will not only delay both the autumn harvest and catching up with wheat, but also the accumulation of life will inevitably affect the timely development of autumn plowing and winter production, and will also cause serious difficulties for next year's spring plowing production. Therefore, it is very necessary for various regions to closely combine the autumn harvest and wheat-catching campaign and carry out a full-scale突击 (tu ji).
    Second, the second issue that leaders and the masses must clearly understand is that the purpose of the autumn harvest and planting is not only to "not miss the farming season," but also mainly to "increase production." Therefore, when the campaign reaches its climax, our leaders should not only be satisfied with "fast," but more importantly, they should grasp the link of "not only fast, but also doing it well." The so-called "good" is to pay attention to the improvement of the quality of the campaign. Specifically speaking, it is not only necessary to "harvest quickly, plant quickly, and plow quickly, but also harvest well, plant well, and plow well." The three special counties have achieved remarkable results in this regard, especially in the technology of wheat planting and intensive cultivation, which has been universally noticed. For example, at the beginning of the campaign, Lucheng held a county-wide technical meeting to study wheat planting technology and exchange experiences, and launched the Liu Jubao movement in wheat planting technology to implement the guidance of wheat planting technology. The masses in Renzhuang, Xiazhuang, and other villages in Licheng have researched a complete set of technologies for land preparation, fertilization, and seed soaking, and selected the most skilled operators when sowing. After the wheat planting campaign reached its climax in Xiwu Village, the masses proposed "people fool the land, and the land fools the belly," which greatly paid attention to technical issues, making the wheat planting fast and good. Secondly, in order to implement technical guidance, counties such as Changzhi, Pingshun, and Huguan compiled technical issues into快板 (kuai ban, a kind of folk art performance), which were widely publicized.
    In short, in our autumn harvest and planting campaign this year, on the one hand, the campaign itself must be closely integrated and implemented to the end; on the other hand, in grasping the campaign, it must also be "grasping tightly, doing it quickly, and also doing it well." "Fast" and "good" should be implemented throughout the entire campaign.

　　不仅要快还要闹好
  　太行三分区秋收秋种运动的几点经验
    苏波　庞洪
  　（一）思想发动结合整顿互助进行全力突击：
    三分区秋收秋种运动的开展，根据各地材料，取得以下几点经验：
    第一、必须由上而下，由下而上进行普遍的思想发动。在这方面，应从两方面入手，首先从群众渡荒基础上，进行思想发动，使群众从回忆灾荒与认识当前的灾情中，树立发家防荒思想，打破少种麦与不种麦的历史传统，进行了大量种麦。如长治一区鹿家庄，连遭冰灾风灾，秋禾损失惨重，经过了发动，大家说：“四三年就是种麦救过人来”，全村扩大麦田八百余亩。苏店村打破了“一亩园十亩田”的轻视种麦与“长治不长麦”等思想，扩大麦田千余亩。其次，基于群众扩大麦田的思想基础上，又引导群众从认识今年农时的紧迫与生活的繁忙以及当前的灾情中（特别是最近的风灾与雹灾），并通过生活安排与精确计算的办法，使群众明确认到秋收秋种，不仅要快，还要闹的好。如潞城四区常庄村，经过思想发动后，一忙就是个忙月，要一口气抢的干到秋垡地”。
    第二、在秋收秋种运动思想发动的基础上，各地普遍进行了整顿互助与劳力组织。首先对原有互助进行了整顿，主要有以下几种类型：一、对带有强制性组织起来的互助组，实行了大胆解散，放手自愿结合。如潞城李村沟梁马斗号召大家：“拿条件，碰心思”。真正使互助建立在自由自愿结合的基础上。二、因问题积累，使互助垮台的，进行了清工清帐，现过现，解决遗留问题，贯彻了等价政策。如潞城马厂村一个大组，因工资不清，大家不满意不愿再互助，经过大算帐，五十九个劳力又都一起干起来了。三、适当的安排生活，科学分工，合理使用力量。如黎城北流村，经过各组讨论，订出了九项生活安排与分工办法，对劳畜力都有适当的分工，大大发挥了劳动强度，原需十三天的生活，九天就做完了。四、发动了抗旱下种的经验，突破小组范围，实行大变工。如潞城南马庄，经过整顿小组互助的基础，实行了大变工，克服了劳力困难。此外各地又以互助为核心，大量的组织了半辅劳力投入生产。经验证明，只有大批组织半辅劳力，才能把地种得更快，如黎城北流群众这样说：“一个妇女不能干，两个妇女顶个汉。”妇女儿童老汉都卷入了生产，大大发挥了组织起来的力量。潞城三区岭后村，组织了男女老少齐动手，四百七十三亩正茬麦，四天内全部种完。总之，整顿互助与组织半辅劳力二者紧密结合起来，才能克服劳力不足的困难。
    经过了深入的思想发动与劳力组织，已使目前的秋收秋种运动进入了紧张阶段，大部地区除种完了正茬麦以外，并很快的转上了突击秋收与大量的赶麦，如黎城提出“种完正茬，种改茬，连收带种，连收带耕”。潞城提出：“随到随割，随收随种，全力突击不留一个闲人”。长治提出：“开展黄一块割一块，割一块种一块的三过火运动”。
    （二）抓的紧，闹的快，还要闹的好。
    各地经过思想发动与劳力组织，使秋收秋种运动很快的开展起来。当运动开展起来之后，对运动如何正确的掌握与领导，即是一个极重要的问题。在这方面根据我们突击种麦的经验，对目前秋收赶麦运动提出以下两点：
    第一、在运动一开始，我们领导与群众思想上，必须明确认识今年的秋收秋种运动是处在早霜早冻，农时紧迫与生活繁忙的情况下，因此要求秋收秋种运动的本身必须密切结合。在领导的掌握与运动的发展上，必须要求“抓的紧，闹的快”。否则，稍有松懈，不仅会使秋收赶麦两耽误，而且生活积累下来，势必影响秋耕垡地以及冬季生产的及时开展，同时对明年的春耕生产，亦将会造成严重的困难，因此目前各地把秋收赶麦运动紧密的结合起来，进行全力突击，这是非常必要的。
    第二、领导与群众思想，必须明确的第二个问题即是：秋收秋种的目的，不仅是为了“不误农时”，而且主要的是为了“增加产量”。因此，要求我们当运动走上高潮时，我们领导上即不应仅仅满足于“快”，而特别重要的应当掌握“不仅要快，而且还要闹好的”环节，其所谓好，就是要注意运动质量的提高，分开来说：不仅要“收的快、种的快、耕的快，而且还要收的好、种的好、耕的好。”三专各县在这方面已取得了显著的成绩，特别是在种麦技术与精耕细作上，普遍的注意了这一点。如潞城在运动一开始，即召开全县技术会议，研究了种麦技术，交流了经验，在种麦技术上开展了刘聚保运动，贯彻了种麦技术的指导工作。黎城的仁庄、霞庄等村群众研究出整地、施肥、浸种的全套技术，下种时并选出掌耧把式。西仵村当种麦运动走上高潮以后，群众提出“人哄地皮，地哄肚皮”，大大注意了技术问题，使麦子种的又快又好。其次，如长治、平顺、壶关等县为了贯彻技术指导，把技术问题编为快板，广为宣传。
    总之，我们今年的秋收秋种运动，一方面要求运动的本身，必须密切结合贯彻到底；另方面，在运动的掌握上，亦必须是“抓的紧闹的快，还要闹得好，”“快”与“好”，应贯彻整个运动。
