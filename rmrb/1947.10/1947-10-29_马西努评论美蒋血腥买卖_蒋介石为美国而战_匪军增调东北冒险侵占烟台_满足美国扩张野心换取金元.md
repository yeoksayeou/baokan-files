Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. Moscow broadcasted Massey's commentary on "Wang Shijie's Efforts" on the 18th, giving a comprehensive review of the recent "loan" transaction negotiations between Chiang and the United States. The article reads: The "aid" from the United States to the Kuomintang has been resolved in principle. To obtain this aid, the Kuomintang has been crying for five months. Zhang Qun complained at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee on September 10 that the United States did not aid the Kuomintang as it did Turkey and Greece. A month later, after Cole, the head of the U.S. military investigation mission, consulted with Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, he claimed that China, like Greece and Turkey, had the same basis for obtaining U.S. military and other assistance. This made the Kuomintang extremely happy.

In this month, the Kuomintang and its American protectors intensified their activities in China and the United States. While Wang Shijie was constantly negotiating with the U.S. government in Washington, the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing also maintained contact with Chiang's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The news from the newspapers clearly shows that such negotiations were not on principles, but on the timing and conditions of granting loans. The collapsing Kuomintang could not wait until the U.S. Congress convened next spring, so it actively lobbied. Foreign usurers took advantage of the Kuomintang's desperation to propose harsh conditions, demanding even more than the proposals brought by Wedemeyer. In order to make foreign usurers trust the bankrupt customers again, they gave the independent status of their banks and monopoly groups to American representatives, handing over the supervision of foreign exchange, finance, taxation, and the party and government power to them, and directly commanding the training of the army and even senior military institutions (including the Ministry of National Defense and its General Staff Headquarters). They also allowed them to control the entire property of South China.

Not only that, but the senior rulers of the Kuomintang also obeyed the command of American usurers and carried out certain activities. In the situation where the People's Liberation Army was launching a major counteroffensive and the Kuomintang fundamentally lacked reserve forces, they actually drove eighteen brigades to the northeastern corner of Shandong, with the aim of allowing American expansionists to obtain another naval base in China. Similarly, the Kuomintang, regardless of its collapse risks in the Northwest, North China, and Central China, has been increasing its troops to the Northeast since August in an attempt to seize Manchuria from the people, so that American bankers may be able to turn Manchuria into a base for American expansion in China and Asia. Their plan did not succeed. However, they have not given up on this plan. According to a Reuters dispatch from New York on October 13, Wang Shijie conveyed Chiang Kai-shek's views on the Manchuria issue to Truman during negotiations on a new U.S. loan. It was no accident. The reporter claimed that as a result of Wang Shijie's trip to the United States, the U.S. government deeply understood the attitude of the Chinese (Chiang) government on the Manchuria issue.

When reporters from Chinese and American newspapers talked about what Wang Shijie would bring back, they wrote: The Americans are not at ease lending the current loan to the Kuomintang authorities all at once. The new loan will be given to the Kuomintang in installments according to the American plan, and the use of the loan will be entirely decided by the Americans. Part of the loan will be used as funding for the Kuomintang to train new soldiers, and another part will be invested in Chinese enterprises, mainly in South China, making South China a special sphere of influence for the United States. The new soldiers are limited to training ten (note: some say twenty) divisions, and these divisions will be used to guard the U.S.'s aggressive territories and U.S. assets in China. The purpose of the new loan is that American expansionist labor elements intend to consolidate their position in China, fuel the Chinese civil war, in order to continue to obtain huge profits, and hinder China's unification and China's democracy and rejuvenation.

  　蒋介石为美国而战
    匪军增调东北冒险侵占烟台
  　满足美国扩张野心换取金元
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】莫斯科十八日广播马西努评“王世杰的奔波”一文，对最近蒋美间的“贷款”交易谈判加以综合评述。该文写道：美国对国民党的“援助”，原则上已获解决。为取得这种援助，国民党已哭叫了五个月。张群曾在九月十日的国民党四中全会上埋怨美国未像对土耳其、希腊一样援助国民党。经过了一个月以后，美国会军事考察团团长柯尔在南京与蒋介石会商后，声称：中国也如希、土一样，有同样的根据获得美国军事的和其他的援助。这使国民党异常高兴。
    在这一个月内，国民党人与其美国保护者在中国及在美国曾加紧活动。当王世杰在华盛顿与美国政府不断进行谈判的时候，美国南京大使馆也与蒋外交部保持联系。由报纸传出的消息明显看出，这样的谈判，不在原则方面，而是在给予贷款的时间和条件。处于崩溃的国民党不能等到明春美国会开会的时候，故积极活动，外国的高利贷主就利用国民党的绝望提出严厉的条件，比魏德迈带来的提案要求的更多。为使外国高利贷者再去信任已经破产了的顾客，他们把自己的银行和独占组合的独立地位让给了美国代表，把对外汇、财政、税收的监督及党政大权交给他们，把训练军队甚至把高级军事机构（其中包括国防部及其参谋总部）亦都交给了他们直接指挥。又将整个华南的财产叫他们支配。
    不仅如此，国民党高级执政者且服从美国高利贷者指挥，进行某些活动。在人民解放军大反攻和国民党根本缺乏后备军的情形下，他们竟将十八个旅赶到山东东北角去，其目的只是为了使美国扩张者在中国再得到一个海军根据地。同样，国民党曾不顾其在西北、华北和华中的崩溃危险，自八月起将军队增调到东北去，企图夺取人民手中的满洲，以便美国银行家有可能将满洲变成为美国在华与在亚洲的扩张根据地。他们这种计划并没有得到成功。可是他们没有放弃这一计划。据十月十三日中央社纽约记者消息：王世杰在进行关于美国新贷款的谈判时，曾经将蒋介石对满洲问题的观点传达给杜鲁门，这并不是偶然的。该记者称：王世杰赴美的结果，美政府深刻的明白了中国（蒋）政府对满洲问题的态度。
    中美报纸的记者在谈到王世杰将带回一些什么东西时写道：美国人不放心把现在的贷款一下借给国民党当局，新贷款将按照美国的计划，分期交给国民党，贷款的使用则全由美国人决定，一部分贷款将作为国民党训练新兵的经费，而另一部分则投资于中国主要是华南的企业，使华南变成美国的特别势力范围。新兵只限于训练十个（按：一说二十个）师团，这些师团并将用于守卫美国在华侵略的领土及美国在华资产。新贷款的目的，就是美国扩张劳力分子打算在中国巩固他们的地位，助长中国内战，以便继续取得大量利润，和阻碍中国的统一及中国的民主和复兴。
