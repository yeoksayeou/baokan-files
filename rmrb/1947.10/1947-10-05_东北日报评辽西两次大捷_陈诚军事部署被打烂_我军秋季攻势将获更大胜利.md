　　Northeast Daily Comments on Two Major Victories in Western Liaoning
    Chen Cheng's Military Deployment Shattered
  　Our Army's Autumn Offensive to Achieve Greater Victory
Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 3rd. The "Northeast Daily" recently commented on the two major victories in western Liaoning in an editorial titled "Salute to the People's Liberation Army of Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning." The newspaper stated: After the bandit Chiang Kai-shek sabotaged the truce agreement and the Political Consultative Conference, our Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning Liberated Area suffered serious attacks and divisions by the Chiang bandits. However, the people of Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning persevered through the difficulties, and in the summer of this year launched an offensive, successively recovering cities such as Weichang, Qian'an, Chifeng, Funing, Ningcheng, Zunhua, Jianping, Pinggu, Ji County, Lingyuan, and Beipiao, and controlling the Ye (Baishou) - Chi (feng) line and the eastern section of the Jin (zhou) - Cheng (de) line, making the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning Liberated Area connected and gradually expanded.

　　After the summer offensive, the People's Liberation Army of Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning became stronger and stronger. In the battles before this offensive, they could only annihilate one enemy regiment at a time, but in this counter-offensive, they were able to annihilate one enemy division and two divisions at a time. Secondly, the editorial pointed out: The Chiang bandits' insufficient troop strength, low morale, and empty rear areas are fatal wounds that they cannot save. Even if they increase troops from within the customs, they cannot save the Chiang bandits' failure in the Northeast. This time, the Chiang bandits dug into their own flesh to replenish the wound by transferring the 49th Army, but in less than two months, they became prisoners of the Liberation Army, greatly supplementing the Liberation Army's weapons and personnel. During the summer offensive, both the Chiang bandits and their master, American imperialism, blamed Du Yuming for the Chiang bandits' failure in the Northeast and kicked him out. After the Chiang bandits flattered their master's intentions and replaced him with Chen Cheng in the Northeast, the American imperialist propaganda machine vigorously promoted Chen Cheng and placed great hopes on him, believing that "after Chen Cheng arrived in the Northeast, the morale of the Kuomintang army would be greatly improved," and that the "government army (Chiang bandits) had confidence in winning the upcoming war." The flattered Chen Cheng bandits also expressed "determination to be loyal," boasting that they would "recover all lost territory in the Northeast from the 'communist bandits' (falsely accusing the People's Liberation Army) regardless of the difficulties and costs," and even said that "it would only take six months to restore the advantage in the Northeast." However, the boast of this defeated "general" who was battered and bloodied by Generals Chen Yi and Su Yu on the East China battlefield was shattered. The two major victories in western Liaoning by the People's Liberation Army are a manifestation of Chen Cheng's initial strategic plan in the Northeast going bankrupt. At the same time, it also shows the incompetence of Chen Cheng's bandit command, the uselessness of Chiang Kai-shek's "replacement," and the fact that American imperialism's so-called "hope" and "confidence" in Chen Cheng will be smashed to pieces by the iron hammer of the People's Liberation Army. From then on, Chen Cheng, who sighed that he was "unlucky," will only sigh that he is "unlucky."

　　The victory in western Liaoning hit the Chiang-Chen bandit army's transportation nerves so hard that the Chiang bandits' supply line, the Beining Railway, would completely lose its function, and Huludao, an important supply transportation port of the Chiang bandit army relying on American imperialism, was also exposed to the huge iron fist of the People's Liberation Army, causing the Chiang-Americans to exclaim in alarm: "The situation is developing seriously." Finally, in addition to pointing out how Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning should overcome difficulties and complete greater tasks in the future, and to guard against complacency and arrogance, the editorial also stated: The two major victories in western Liaoning disrupted Chen Cheng's military deployment, mobilized the enemy, and frightened the enemy, and the Democratic Allied Army's autumn offensive, which the enemy feared, will achieve greater results.

### 东北日报评辽西两次大捷  陈诚军事部署被打烂　我军秋季攻势将获更大胜利

　　东北日报评辽西两次大捷
    陈诚军事部署被打烂
  　我军秋季攻势将获更大胜利
    【新华社东北三日电】“东北日报”顷在题为“向冀察热辽人民解放军致敬”之社论中评论此次辽西两次大捷。该报称：在蒋贼破坏停战协定及政协后，我冀察热辽解放区曾遭受蒋匪严重的进攻和分割，然而我冀察热辽人民坚忍不拔的渡过了困难，而于今年夏季发动了攻势，先后收复围场、迁安、赤峰、抚宁、宁城、遵化、建平、平谷、蓟县、凌源、北票等城市，并控制叶（柏寿）赤（峰）线与锦（州）承（德）线东段，使冀察热辽解放区连成一片并日渐扩大。
    夏季攻势后，冀察热辽人民解放军愈战愈强，在这次攻势前的作战中一次还只能歼敌一个团的力量，而在这次反攻作战中却能一次歼灭敌人一个师及两个师。其次社论指出：蒋匪兵力不足，士气低落，后方空虚乃是其无法挽救的致命伤，即使从关内再增加兵力，也无法挽救蒋匪在东北的失败。这次蒋匪挖肉补疮的调来四十九军，可是不到两个月却又成了解放军的俘虏，大大的补充了解放军的武器和人员。夏季攻势中蒋贼及其主子美帝国主义都把蒋匪在东北的失败归罪于杜聿明，而把他一脚踢出去，蒋贼奉承其主子的意旨换陈诚到东北来后，美帝国主义的宣传机关曾大力的替陈诚打气和捧场，并寄予极大的希望，认为“陈诚到东北后，国民党军队的士气将大大提高，”并对“政府军（蒋匪）有赢得行将到来的战争的信心”，而受宠若惊的陈诚匪徒也表示“决心效忠”，大吹牛皮要“不管困难与代价多大”，一定要从“共匪”（诬指人民解放军）手中收回一切东北失地”，甚至还说“只需要六个月就可恢复在东北的优势，”可是这个在华东战场被陈毅、粟裕诸将军打得头破血流的常败“将军”的牛皮是吹炸了，人民解放军的辽西两次大捷是陈诚在东北战略计划初步破产的表现。同时，也说明了陈诚匪徒指挥的拙劣，说明了蒋贼“撤换”的无用，也说明了美帝国主义在对陈诚的所谓“希望”与“信心”。必将在人民解放军的铁锤下打得粉碎。从此自叹“命苦”的陈诚将只有长叹“命苦”了。
    辽西的胜利是如此沉重的打在蒋陈匪军的运输神经上，使得蒋匪的补给线北宁路将完全失去作用，而蒋匪军依赖美帝国主义的重要补给运输港葫芦岛也暴露在人民解放军巨大的铁拳之前，使得蒋美不得不连忙惊呼：“事态在严重发展”中。最后社论除指出冀察热辽此后应如何克服困难完成更大任务，要力戒自满骄傲之外。又指称：辽西两次大捷破坏了陈诚的军事部署，调动了敌人，吓得敌人惊惶失措，敌人所惧怕的民主联军秋季攻势将要获得更大的战果。
