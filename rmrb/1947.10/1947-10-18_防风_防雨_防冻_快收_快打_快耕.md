　　[Report from Our Correspondent in Heshun] Each village in the First District has launched an autumn harvest competition. Over 1,900 children and 4,600 women throughout the district have participated in the autumn harvest, reaping more than 48,000 mu in five days. The masses' slogan is "Three Quicks and Three Prevents": quick harvest to prevent grain damage by wind, quick threshing to prevent rotting, and quick plowing to prevent freezing. At the same time, nine methods for achieving the "Three Quicks" have been identified: (1) In spring and autumn, even embroidery girls leave their beds to have women and children go to the fields; autumn harvesting can replace men; (2) Rectify mutual aid and conduct organized autumn harvesting; (3) Villages and teams launch challenges against each other. For example, Liu Kun's team and Du Dahe's team in Xiren Village challenged each other to clear the fields in twenty days; (4) Broadcast daily praises of good teams, groups, and individuals, as well as heroic deeds, so that everyone strives to make contributions. For example, Yang Wubao from Baiquan made contributions in weeding, and is determined to make contributions in the autumn harvest movement; (5) Specific division of labor, some harvesting, some carrying; (6) Plow the land with cattle, donkeys, and mules together, changing half-day plowing to full-day plowing. This has two advantages: first, more land is plowed; second, plowing a full day after sunrise prevents frost damage, which is good for planting seedlings next year; (7) Specialized plowing leads to good and fast plowing, without exhausting the animals; (8) Organized women and children to reclaim wasteland, reducing the burden on livestock. One animal could originally plow three mu, and this way it can plow four mu; (9) Quick threshing can only be achieved by building more threshing grounds. Three households built a threshing ground together, which made threshing very fast. (Zhiyuan, Xiqun, Taolin, Xuesheng)
　　[Report from Our Correspondent in Xiyang] The Seventh District has recently experienced two or three days of light rain, causing some anxiety among the masses. Some said, "We haven't had a thorough rain all year, and now we're going to have cloudy days in the fall." Then a strong wind blew, clearing the sky. In order to prevent rain and wind, cadres in each village generally took the lead in organizing the masses for a rush harvest. For example, Li Mingyu, the village head of Dingyu Village, got up in the middle of the night to gather all the village cadres and team leaders to discuss the rush harvest, organizing four rush harvest teams. The cadres personally went to each team to lead, and before dawn, more than 300 men, women, and children in the village were mobilized. In two days, a total of 201 mu were harvested, 19 mu of grass were cut, and 5.5 mu of wheat were sown. In particular, the Hongxi Juan team has now completed harvesting early crops and helped the Wang Huaguo team harvest three mu. In Zhushipu, in order to prevent wind and rush the harvest, labor hero Zhang Shifu actively took the lead, organizing the villagers to mobilize in the middle of the night to harvest 180 mu. Other villages are also actively taking action. (Mangxiao, Xinying, Guanyin, Zhaorong)

　  【本报昔阳讯】七区日前连下了两三天小雨，群众有些着急，有的说：“一年没下一场透雨，到秋还要来个不晴天”。接着一次大风刮起，将天刮晴。为了防雨防风，这时各村干部普遍带头，领导群众突击抢收。如丁峪村长李明玉等为了抢收半夜便爬起来，召集全村干部及拨工队长，研究抢收，组织了四个抢收大队，干部亲身深入各队领导，不到天明，全村三百余男女老少都出动了。两天内，共收二百零一亩，割草十九亩，种麦五亩半。特别是洪喜卷队，现已将早庄稼收完，又帮助王化国队收了三亩。朱石铺为了防风抢收，劳英张士富积极亲身带头，组织全村群众半夜出动抢收一百八十亩。其它各村也都在积极行动中。
