　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Folk Artists
　　Undergo Transformation and Go to the Countryside for Internship
　　[Report from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Office on the 5th] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region's transformation of folk artists has achieved remarkable results, and they have been dispatched to various places for internship. The Folk Art Department of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles was renamed the Folk Art Federation in September and is directly led by the Propaganda Department of the Regional Party Committee. The folk artists transformed by the association have been going down for internship in four groups since the beginning of August this year. The first is the Yanggu music class, led by Li Yushu, director of the Sheng and Flute Research Association, and Jin Shilian, deputy director, to conduct activities in the Yanggu area, organize small-scale evening parties or participate in various district and village meetings. The second group is the Yangqin class, led by the class leader Guo Yuancheng, to Guancheng, touring and performing at the 18th branch of the rear hospital's fifth branch to comfort the wounded. The third group went to Liaocheng, and the fourth group is the magic class, which went to Yangcheng and was assigned work by the county government to carry out publicity in specific coordination with the central work of review, war service, and production. In addition, there are also circus, magic, and shadow play classes being trained and preparing to go down. There are also more than forty old artists who are transforming their thinking. In order to plant seedlings and blossom in every village in the future and universally transform folk artists, the Art Federation plans to cultivate and promote cadres from existing artists, and at the same time, it is also preparing to help Guancheng County run a folk artist training class. In addition, in terms of New Year picture improvement, it is being actively carried out and has achieved initial results. According to past folk art, the vast majority promoted feudal superstition, obscenity, and eulogized the feudal ruling class, but its skills were popular with the masses, deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and folk artists were everywhere. If they are not transformed, they are poisonous everywhere. Therefore, the transformation of folk art to gradually transition to mass art is extremely important.

　　冀鲁豫民间艺人
  　改造后下乡实习
    【本报冀鲁豫五日电】冀鲁豫艺人改造民间艺人，获得显著成绩，已分赴各地实习工作。冀鲁豫文联民间艺术部，于九月改名为民间艺术联合会，直接由区党委宣传部领导，该会所改造的民间艺人，自今年八月初到现在，已有四个班下去实习工作。一是阳谷的音乐班，由笙笛研究会主任李玉书、副主任金世连率领，到阳谷一带活动，组织小型晚会或参加区村各种会议；第二组是洋琴班，由班长郭元成率领，到观城，在后方医院五分院十八所巡回演唱，慰劳伤员；第三组到聊城，第四组是魔术班，到阳城，由县府分配工作，具体配合复查战勤生产等中心工作进行宣传。此外，尚有正在受训的马戏班、魔术、洋片班也准备下去。还有四十多个旧艺人，正在改造思想。为了将来村村插苗开花，普遍改造民间艺人，艺联拟从现有艺人中，培养与提拔干部，同时并准备帮助观城县开办民间艺人训练班。另外年画改进方面，正在积极进行中，也有初步成绩。按过去的民间艺术，绝大部分是宣扬封建迷信、淫荡，替封建统治阶级歌功颂德，但其技巧则为广大群众喜见乐闻，深入人心，而民间艺人遍地皆是，如不改造则遍地皆毒，因此，民艺的改造，使民间艺术逐渐过渡到大众艺术，极为重要。
