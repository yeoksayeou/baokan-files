Xinhua News Agency, East China, 29th. The military and civilians of five counties in central Jiangsu—Nantong, Rugao, Taixing, Taixian, and Jingjiang—fought heroically for three days and crushed the seven-pronged "mopping-up" operation by Chiang Kai-shek's entire 21st Division and security forces, totaling over 4,000 men. After the large-scale offensives by the people's armed forces in August and September, which recovered large areas of lost territory, Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly transferred the 21st Division from as far away as Taiwan. After many days of deployment, they launched a seven-pronged attack on the 16th of this month. Three routes departed from Rugao, Taixian, and Huangqiao, attempting to converge and attack the Taixian people's armed forces. Another route attacked the central part of Nantong, while the others set out from Baipu, Jingjiang, Taixing, and other places in three routes for coordination. The people's armed forces of our counties coordinated to annihilate the enemy. On the 17th, in central Nantong, they annihilated over a hundred enemies at a ratio of one to twelve casualties; then, they turned back to fiercely attack the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who invaded from Baipu, killing over a hundred men, including Ding Wufeng, the battalion commander of the 146th Brigade's transportation battalion. On the 18th, the people's armed forces of Liangtai (two Tais) and Jingjiang also separately defeated the enemy, annihilating nearly two companies of Chiang's county security forces. By this point, the enemy's converging "mopping-up" plan was completely bankrupt. According to preliminary statistics, a total of over 470 enemy soldiers at the battalion commander level and below were annihilated.

　　苏中五县军民奋战三天
  　粉碎蒋匪七路“扫荡”
    【新华社华东二十九日电】苏中南通、如皋、泰兴、泰县、靖江等五县军民三天中，粉碎蒋匪整二十一师、保安队等部四千余人的七路反扑“扫荡”。自八、九两月人民武装大举出击，收复大块失地后，蒋匪慌忙远自台湾将廿一师调来，经多日布署，于本月十六日开始七路出动，除三路由如皋、泰县、黄桥出动，图合击泰县人民武装外，另一路进击南通中部，其他并由白蒲、靖江、泰兴等地分三路策应配合。我各县人民武装协同歼敌，十七日首于（南）通中以一与十二伤亡之比，歼敌百余；继迂回猛击自白蒲出犯蒋匪，毙敌一四六旅辎重营营长丁五风以下百余名。十八日两泰及靖江人民武装亦分路将敌击溃，歼蒋记县保安队等近两个中队。至此敌合击“扫荡”计划即全部破产。据初步统计，共歼敌营长以下四百七十余人。
