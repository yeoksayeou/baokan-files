　　Democratic Government Persists in its Positions
　　Sharing Life and Death, Prosperity and Hardship with the Masses
[This newspaper's dispatch from Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 29th] After Liu Deng's army marched south into the Dabie Mountains, Chiang's New Fifth Army, like a cat chasing a mouse, scurried to the southern Hebei-Shandong-Henan Yellow River region, attempting to destroy our rural positions and carry out "netting" sweeps from north to south. However, because we shared weal and woe with the masses and resolutely persisted in the struggle in the hinterland, our rural positions remain solid. After the enemy scurried away, we vigorously launched revenge movements, and the masses' emotions were even more heightened. From August 7th, the New Fifth Army began in the Taihang Mountains, passing through Nanwang, Yuncheng, Juye and other counties towards Nanzhuang, "sweeping" and "suppressing" every village. Our local democratic governments always led the soldiers and civilians to persist in their positions. Cadres in Pengze District of Juye County expressed to the masses: "We live together and die in the same place." They resolutely relied on the masses and did not leave the area. The enemy held meetings in a village during the day, and they would insert themselves into that village at night to hold meetings, exposing enemy rumors and boosting the masses' confidence in victory. In the sandy soil area around Guantun, two miles away from the enemy's stronghold, land distribution, grain distribution, and livestock distribution were carried out. When the enemy was in Nanzhuang, Zhandai District avoided the worst of it, detoured back to its own district, and immediately convened a meeting of all district cadres to deploy various struggle tasks against the enemy, resolutely supporting the masses, controlling landlords and launching anti-enemy activities, combining these with destroying roads, using guerrilla warfare to blockade the enemy in the city. Since the New Fifth Army entered Junan County on August 21st, cadres in each district immediately dispersed to persist. The enemy focused on sweeping Changyi and Shunhe districts. After our cadres in these two districts avoided the worst of it, they immediately concentrated to form armed work teams, reconnaissance teams, and combat teams, resolutely confronting the enemy. After a work group in a certain village learned about the enemy's situation at night, the next morning they divided into two groups to capture the enemy's telephone operators and cut the enemy's telephone lines, capturing two enemy telephone operators alive and cutting dozens of pounds of telephone wire, earning commendation from the county party committee. In the counties and districts where the enemy arrived, our cadres relied on the masses and always persisted. After the enemy scurried away, we made big moves to launch revenge movements. After recovering Shan County, it was proposed: "Turn grief and indignation into strength!" calling on the masses to oppose Chiang and seek revenge. According to extremely incomplete statistics, the losses suffered by the county when the New Fifth Army pressed down on it were: up to 400 livestock were looted, countless chickens, pigs, sheep, and grain, and up to 7,000 young men were conscripted (most of whom escaped back). Everywhere the enemy went, women were generally raped. The masses suffered such an unprecedented catastrophe and were extremely grieved and resentful. After the recovery, our county and district governments immediately conducted condolences, supported the masses, and thoroughly liquidated Chiang's roots and teeth – the landlord "Returning Home Corps." Currently, the masses' emotions are unprecedentedly high, and the anti-Chiang and revenge movement is developing in full swing.

  　与群众同生死共甘苦
    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】刘邓大军南征大别山区后，蒋新五军如猫走老鼠出，忽忙窜至冀鲁豫黄河以南地区，企图摧毁我农村阵地，由北到南实行“拉网”式扫荡。但由于我与群众同甘苦，坚决坚持腹地斗争，农村阵地依然巩固。敌窜走后，我则大力开展复仇运动，群众情绪更加高涨。新五军在八月七日起，由太行山开始，经南旺、郓城、巨野等县往南庄，村村“扫荡”“清剿”，我当地民主政府则始终率领军民坚持阵地，巨野县彭泽区干部向群众表示：“生在一起，死在一处。”坚决依靠群众，没离开地区。敌人白天在那个村庄开会，他们夜晚就也插到那个村庄开会，揭破敌人谣言，鼓舞群众胜利信心。在离敌据点官屯二里地周围沙土的一带，进行了分地、分粮分牲口工作，盏台区在敌人南庄时避了风头，绕道插回本区后，立刻召开全区干部会议，布置对敌各种斗争工作，坚决给群众撑腰，控制地主与展开反资敌，实行结合破坏道路，以麻雀战封锁敌人于城内。巨南县自新五军八月二十一日进入县境后，各区干部立即分散坚持，敌采取以昌邑、顺河两区为重点扫荡，我该两区干部避过风头后，立即集中组成武装工作队、侦察队、战斗队，坚决与敌周旋。某村工作组于夜间了解敌情后，次日早晨即分两组捕捉敌电话员与收割敌电线，生俘敌电话员二名、收割电线数十斤，获得县委表扬。敌所到之县区，我干部依靠群众，始终坚持，敌窜走后，我则大动，开展复仇运动。山县收复后，提出：“变悲愤为力量！”号召群众反蒋复仇。该县在新五军压境时遭受之损失，仅据极不完全统计：抢走之牲口即达四百头，鸡、猪、羊与粮食无数，被拉走壮丁达七千人（约大批逃回）。敌所到之处，妇女普遍被奸淫。群众遭受如此空前浩劫，悲愤痛恨至极，收复后，我县区政府，立即进行慰问，给群众撑腰，彻底清算蒋根、蒋牙——地主“还乡团”。目前群众情绪空前高涨，反蒋复仇运动正如火如荼开展中。
