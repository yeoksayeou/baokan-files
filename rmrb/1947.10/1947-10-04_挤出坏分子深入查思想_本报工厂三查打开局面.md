　　[This Newspaper's News] In the "Three Checks" campaign at this newspaper's factory, the situation initially failed to open up. After the leadership understood the ideology, they declared that they would not tolerate those struggle targets who had infiltrated and caused extreme damage to the work. Then, they mobilized and enlightened proactive workers, peasants, and comrades of other backgrounds, explaining that those with unstable positions and mistakes could solve and correct their positions ideologically during the study of the land reform movement. After more than ten days of mobilization and support for the masses, various departments successively exposed the destructive crimes of infiltrated landlords. Song Fugen, a landlord in the typesetting department, had a father (Song Huaiyi) who made his fortune by colluding with bandits in the past, and served as a special agent during the War of Resistance Against Japan. He was struggled against by the masses in the land reform movement and secretly fled. The village government tried to capture him many times without success. Song Fugen even issued a false travel permit for his father, fabricating the reason that the People's Daily sent him to Pengcheng, Cixian, Dongchangfu, and other places to buy materials, stamping it with a fake official seal and filling in a deadline. He also released his uncle and landowner special agent ×××. After these crimes were exposed, all employees decided to send him back to the village government for the masses to handle. Du Fuyao, a landlord in the machine department, was dissatisfied with the land reform movement after his family was struggled against. He worked passively and even sabotaged, misprinting the People's Daily three times. Fortunately, it was discovered before distribution, and no political damage was caused. The saboteur has been handed over to the local masses for handling. Fu Zihe, a landlord in the platemaking department, sabotaged tools three times, often feigned illness to rest, provoked disunity between superiors and subordinates, attacked proactive workers and peasants, and worked in a careless manner, making several mistakes with the title characters. He has been cleared out of the factory. Currently, the trade union is rectifying its organization, and the leadership has proposed: This squeezing out of feudalism should serve as a guide for studying the land reform movement in the future, strictly examining our ideology, class, and position.

　　挤出坏分子深入查思想
  　本报工厂三查打开局面
    【本报讯】本报工厂在三查中，开始打不开局面，领导上了解思想后，声明对混入的斗争对象对工作有极大破坏者，决不宽容，然后动员启发工农积极分子和其他成份的同志，说明因立场不稳有错误，可在学习土改运动中从思想上解决端正立场。经过十来天动员给群众撑腰后，各部纷纷揭发混入地主破坏罪行；排字部地主宋福根，他父亲（宋怀义）过去是和土匪勾结发家，在抗战中作过特务，在土地改革运动中被群众斗争，偷跑外出，村公所多次捕捉未获，宋福根竟给他父亲开上假路条，捏造理由是人民日报派赴彭城、磁县、东昌府等地买材料，盖上假公章，填上期限。又把他叔父及×××地主特务放走。这些罪行经揭发后，全体职工决定送回村公所交群众处理。机器部地主杜福尧，他家被斗以后，对土改运动不满，工作消极怠工以至破坏，印错三次人民日报，幸在发行前被发觉，未造成政治上损失，该破坏分子业已送交当地群众处理。打版部地主傅子和，破坏工具三次，经常装病休息、挑拨上下级团结，打击工农积极分子，工作上吊儿郎当，错了好几次题目字，已清除出厂。现工会正整顿组织，领导上提出：这次挤封建应作为今后学习土改运动之引线，严格检查我们的思想、阶级、立场。
