Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. According to United Press and Agence France-Presse reports: The Nanjing Chiang bandit military authorities are shocked by the north-south offensives of the People's Liberation Army in the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu area and the Northeast. Xuzhou extended its curfew on the evening of the 30th, and Chiang bandit Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi hurriedly flew to Xuzhou on the 2nd to arrange the city's "defense." Nanjing also instructed the Jiangsu Provincial Government to take "defensive measures." Chiang party officials have even talked about the threat to the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway. In the Northeast, Shenyang has declared martial law because the People's Liberation Army's "threat to Shenyang has become increasingly serious," and the Shenyang market is fluctuating sharply. Agence France-Presse reported: The People's Liberation Army "has advanced to strongholds a few kilometers from Changchun, and the Manchurian (Chiang) government area has been divided into several pieces." Chiang bandit Northeast Deputy Director Zheng Dongguo was forced to admit: "The Communist army's current offensive is stronger than the summer offensive and may last longer" because the current military situation is very "critical." Chiang Kai-shek flew from Nanjing to Beiping on the afternoon of the 4th and will rush to Shenyang because "the situation in Shenyang has become tense since the Communist Party launched the Northeast offensive."

　　蒋介石仓惶飞东北徐州沈阳同时戒严
    【新华社陕北五日电】据合众社法新社消息：南京蒋匪军事当局正因人民解放军在豫皖苏地区及东北地区的南北攻势而震惊。徐州已于三十日晚延长戒严时间，蒋匪国防部长白崇禧二日仓惶飞往徐州，布置该城之“防守”。南京并训令江苏省政府采取“防御手段”。蒋党官员甚至已谈到京沪铁路的被威胁问题。东北方面，沈阳业已宣布戒严，因人民解放军“对沈阳的威胁已日益严重”，沈阳市场在激剧波动中。法新社称：人民解放军“已进抵距长春数公里的据点，满洲（蒋）政府地区已被分割成若干块”。蒋匪东北端副主任郑洞友被迫承认：“共军现在的攻势比夏季攻势更强大而且可能为期更长。”因为目前军用处情势甚为“危急”。蒋介石已于四日午后由南京飞北平，即将赶赴沈阳。因“自共产党发动东北攻势后，沈阳形势已形紧张。”
