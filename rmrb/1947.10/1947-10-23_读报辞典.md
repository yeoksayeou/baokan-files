　　Reading the Newspaper Dictionary
　　CIO – that is, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, founded in November 1935, is a labor union of workers in American capital industries (such as hardware, electrical materials, etc.). It has about six million members and is a relatively progressive and influential labor union in the United States. It also has many Communist Party members, and the chairman is also a democrat. However, some of the upper-level leaders are relatively reactionary and bow to the monopoly capitalists.
　　AFL – that is, the American Federation of Labor, founded in 1881, was composed of various independent handicraft unions at that time. Now most of its members are also light industry, construction industry, and handicraft unions, with about six million members. But because it is more conservative and romantic, its influence is not as great as the CIO. Its负责人 are reactionary, betray the working class, and act as agents of the monopoly capitalists. Therefore, internal struggles are very fierce, and the democrats inside it often struggle to overthrow the leaders.

    产联——即产业职工联合会，成立于一九三五年十一月，是美国资本工业工人（如五金、电料等）的工会，会员有六百万左右，是美国较进步的、影响最大的工会，其中还有许多共产党员，主席也是民主人士。不过上层领导分子中也有一部分是比较反动的，向独占资本家低头的。
    劳联——即美国劳工联合会，成立于一八八一年，是由当时各个独立的手工工会组成的，现在会员也大部是轻工业、建筑工业及手工业工会，会员也有六百万左右。但因较保守、较浪漫，影响不如产联大。它的负责人是反动的，是叛卖工人阶级的，做了独占资本家的代理人。所以内部斗争很厉害，它里面的民主份子常作推翻领导人的斗争。
