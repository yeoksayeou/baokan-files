　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 2nd: Our army continues to expand its offensive on the Beining Railway, the vital supply line for Chiang's bandits. On the night of September 29th, we captured Xingcheng Station (over 120 li southwest of Jinzhou) and also captured Baimiaozi Station southwest of Xingcheng. The defending enemy fled in panic. We captured a great many supplies and destroyed three railway bridges.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 2nd: Chiang's troops are deserting in increasing numbers along the Chiang-occupied Chinese Changchun Railway. Since the bandit chieftain Chen Cheng replaced Du Yuming more than 40 days ago, the desertion of Chiang's bandits trapped along the Chinese Changchun Railway has not stopped for a single day. On the "name roster" of every unit, from its main force, the New 1st Army, to its local bandit puppet teams, the number of desertion reductions accounts for a large proportion. The 184th Regiment of the 50th Division of the New 1st Army, stationed in the Gongzhuling area, had only one company in its second battalion. It originally had over a hundred soldiers, but now only half remain. Each squad, apart from the machine gun group, has only one or two riflemen. The 1st Regiment of the 2nd Independent Division of Chiang's bandits originally had more than 1,300 soldiers. After days of fleeing, now there are only 800 people, with deserters accounting for more than 30% of the original number. The 5th Company of the 380th Regiment of the 130th Division of the 53rd Army, stationed on the Siping front, originally had more than 150 soldiers, but now only half remain. The 14th Regiment of the 5th Detachment of the Chiang puppet Northeast Security Force originally had 500 soldiers, but now only has more than 300 people. Before being annihilated, the 314th Regiment of the 105th Division of Wang Tiehan's 49th Army, newly transferred from within the pass, had 150 soldiers in one company, but as a result of desertions, it had less than 60 people. In an attempt to salvage the situation, Chen Cheng and his other lackeys intensified their brutal rule, such as "prohibiting soldiers from approaching the people," "not allowing contact with family members," "implementing strict surveillance and joint responsibility," and "exterminating the entire family of deserters," etc. However, the result did not remedy the increasing number of soldiers fleeing. Recently, even among middle and lower-ranking officers, deserters are increasing daily. For example, Tao Yi, the deputy head of the 2nd Regiment of the 207th Division, Luo Gui, the battalion commander of the 1st Battalion of the 42nd Regiment of the 14th Division, and Liu Yingjie, the company commander of the 3rd Company of the same unit, as well as the company commanders of the 7th and 8th companies of the 346th Regiment of the 53rd Army, have all successively resigned or deserted on the grounds of illness. Soldiers of Chiang's bandit Independent 12th Division stationed at Beishangtaizi in Shenyang, even under extremely tight surveillance and blockade, still used bandages to connect and lower themselves one by one from the second floor, and eighteen escaped in one night. The reason why Chiang's soldiers act in this way is, as Wang Gengui, a soldier of the 195th Division who escaped from Bamiancheng, said, because "escaping is escaping for their lives." And this is precisely an escape route for Chiang's bandit soldiers and their middle and lower-ranking officers, who are deeply suffering, to avoid becoming cannon fodder in the civil war.

### 辽西我军向东发展攻势　攻克北宁路兴城站　中长沿线蒋军逃亡数目日增

　　辽西我军向东发展攻势
  　攻克北宁路兴城站
  　中长沿线蒋军逃亡数目日增
    【新华社东北前线二日电】我军在蒋匪输血管北宁线继续扩展攻势，于九月二十九日夜攻入兴城车站（锦州西南一百二十余里），并攻克兴城西南之白庙子车站，守敌狼狈溃逃。我缴获极众，并破坏铁桥三座。
    【新华社东北二日电】蒋占中长路沿线蒋军逃亡日众。自匪首陈诚代替杜聿明四十多天以来，困据中长沿线的蒋匪逃亡没有一天停止过，从其主力新一军到他的地方匪伪团队的每一个部队“花名册”上，逃亡减员的数字都占了很大的比例。驻公主岭一带的新一军五十师一八四团仅二营一个连，原有士兵百余名，现已只剩一半。每班除去机枪组外，就只有一两个步枪兵。蒋匪独立师二师一团原有士兵一千三百余人。连日逃跑后，现在只有八百人，逃亡的占原有人数百分之三十以上。驻四平一线的五十三军一三○师三八○团第五连，原有士兵一百五十余名，现亦只剩一半。蒋伪东北保安第五支队十四团原有士兵五百人，现只有三百余人。新从关内调来的王铁汉四十九军一○五师在被歼之前，其三一四团一个连原有士兵一百五十名，逃亡结果已不足六十名。陈诚和其他的奴才们为图挽救，更加紧其残暴统治，如“禁止士兵与百姓接近”，“不许接触家属”，“实行严格监视、连座活动”与“逃亡者灭全家”等等办法，但结果无补于其士兵逃风的增多，最近以来即中下级军官群中，逃亡者亦日众，如二○七师二团副团长陶义，十四师四二团一营营长罗规及同部三连连长刘英杰，以及五十三军三四六团七八两连的连长等，都已相继称病辞职或逃亡。驻沈阳北上台子蒋匪独立第十二师士兵虽在极端严密的监视与封锁下，仍以绑带连接从二楼一个一个的吊下来，一夜就逃跑了十八个。蒋军士兵之所以如此，就如八面城逃出的一九五师士兵王亘桂所谈的，乃是因为“逃跑就是逃命”。而这也正是深受苦难的蒋匪士兵和其中下级军官避免当内战炮灰的一条出路。
