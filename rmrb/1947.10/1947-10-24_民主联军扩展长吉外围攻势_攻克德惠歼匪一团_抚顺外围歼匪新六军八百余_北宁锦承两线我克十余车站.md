Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 22nd: A unit of the Democratic Allied Forces captured Dehui County, the only remaining stronghold of the Chiang bandits in the salient area north of Changchun, on the 20th. Our army launched a general attack and broke into the city in ten minutes, ending the battle in two hours. The entire local army of the Chiang bandits, the 53rd Provisional Division, one regiment of over a thousand men including the regimental commander, were annihilated. The results of the battle are being cleared. Dehui is the fourteenth city recovered by us in the autumn offensive.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 22nd: A large unit of the Democratic Allied Forces has continuously annihilated one battalion and five additional companies of the enemy on the outskirts of Fushun since the 16th. On the 16th and 17th, Guanmenshan, Sanjiazi, Erhuoluo and other places northeast of Fushun were recovered, annihilating one battalion and two companies of the Chiang bandit "Youth Army" 207th Division (under the command of the New Sixth Army). On the 20th, a bandit mountain artillery company, a machine gun company, and an infantry company were annihilated at Ajibaozi, northeast of Fushun. In order to rescue the annihilated enemy, the Chiang bandits dispatched large numbers of troops from Fushun for several consecutive days, aided by aircraft and armored vehicles, carrying out repeated bombings and strafing, all of which were repelled by our forces. One American-made B-25 enemy aircraft was shot down at Xia Hada, northeast of Fushun, and its pilot, Guo Fenglin, was captured alive. This is the fourth aircraft shot down by us in the autumn offensive. According to preliminary statistics, over a hundred enemies have been killed or wounded in the past few days, and over seven hundred enemy officers and soldiers below the rank of battalion commander have been captured. Eleven mountain guns and anti-tank guns, and fifty-seven various machine guns were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 22nd: A unit of the People's Liberation Army on the southern front continued to carry out sabotage operations on the Beining and Jincheng lines. Since the Double Tenth Festival, in the past ten days, they have successively captured many stations on the Beining Line south of Jinzhou and north of Xingcheng, such as Gaoqiao, Yingpan, Chenjiatun, and Hanjiagou, and stations on the Jinzhou-Chaoyang section of the Jincheng Line, such as Jinlingsi, Chaoyangsi, Liuheqiao, Zoujiatun, Yilihezi, Xiajitai, and Xuejiatun. On the night of the 15th, our army also simultaneously raided the outskirts of Chaoyang and Beipiao, and troops approached Yixian City. The Chiang bandits in various places shrank into the cities, daring not to fight. When our army attacked Jinlingsi Station, the division headquarters, two regimental headquarters, and four battalions of the bandit 174th Division fled in panic at the first sound of gunfire, and a part of them were annihilated by us. According to incomplete battle statistics, over 70 li of roads were destroyed between Jinzhou and Yingpan on the Beining Line, and between Jiuguantai and Sifangtai on the Jincheng Line. Over 420 bandits were killed or captured, and hundreds of guns and over 60,000 rounds of ammunition were seized.
