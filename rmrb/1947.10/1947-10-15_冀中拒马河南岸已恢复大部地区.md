Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 13th: The military and civilians of Rong (Cheng) Ding (Xing) (newly established county) in the northwest of Daqing River have fought bravely against the "mopping-up" bandits and puppets for two months. Now most of the area south of the Juma River has been recovered by us. Since the beginning of the "mopping-up" of the tenth district by Chiang's army on August 6, the Chiang's army in the Rongding area south of the Juma River has built bunkers and highways on a large scale, and built the Rong (Cheng) Ding (Xing) line, Rong (Cheng) Xiong (County) and other three blockade lines. More than 20 strongholds were built in the villages of Hucun, Wangzhuang, and Shahe belonging to the above-mentioned lines, in an attempt to divide and blockade. The local military and civilians insisted on working and carrying out struggles despite the enemy's artillery fire. The militia of Rongding County fought more than 20 times, killing, wounding and capturing more than 20 enemies. Thanks to the persistent struggle of the military and civilians throughout the county and the heroic attacks of our army, the main force of Chiang Kai-shek bandits was forced to withdraw completely from the Rongding area on September 7. The local military and civilians immediately flattened the eight bandit-occupied strongholds in Bailong, Xiniu, and Liucun, and the Rong (Cheng) Xiong (County) highway was also brought under our control. Our army then launched guerrilla warfare and political offensives. On the night of the 9th of last month, the militia of a certain district attacked the Shahe stronghold, set fire to the sentry tower and destroyed most of it. Militia cadres from a certain district advanced to the banks of the Juma River and the banks of the Daqing River, blocking and intercepting the bandits and puppets crossing the river. More than 30 Baojia organizations were also completely destroyed by us.

　　冀中拒马河南岸已恢复大部地区
    【新华社晋察冀十三日电】大清河西北容（城）定（兴）（新设县）军民两月来与“扫荡”匪伪英勇斗争，现拒马河南大部地区为我恢复。自八月六日蒋军对十分区开始“扫荡”后，拒马河南容定地区蒋军大修碉堡、公路，并修筑容（城）定（兴）线，容（城）雄（县）等三道封锁线，在上述各线所属之胡村、王庄、沙河等村修起二十余座点碉，企图分割封锁，当地军民则冒着敌人炮火坚持工作，开展斗争，容定全县民兵共作战二十余次，毙伤俘敌廿余人。由于全县军民坚持斗争与我大军英勇出击，迫使蒋伪匪主力于九月七日由容定地区全部撤退，当地军民即将白龙、西牛、刘村等八处匪占点碉平毁，容（城）雄（县）公路亦为我控制。我军继即展开游击战争与政攻，上月九日夜某区民兵袭入沙河据点，火烧岗楼毁其大部，某区民兵干部挺进拒马河畔与大清河畔，封锁阻击过河匪伪，三十余处保甲组织，亦为我全部摧毁。
