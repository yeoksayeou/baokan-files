　　Old Granny Gen
  　A Story of Persevering in Guerrilla Warfare in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region
    When the enemy began to establish puppet organizations in Linze District and Township, comrades from the county and district who were persisting in guerrilla warfare often came to × Village in the evenings, and the home of Old Granny Gen, the women's association leader, became a secret home for the working comrades. In the village, many people called Old Granny Gen "Grandma" out of respect.

    One day, it was raining lightly. Old Granny Gen gathered the women of the whole village for a meeting, calling on everyone to keep secrets. Everyone remembered Old Granny's words, "We are one family with the Eighth Route Army." However, the landlords reported this to the enemy. That day, the puppet township office arrested Old Granny Gen. The news of Old Granny Gen's arrest reached the ears of every woman, and they all came out of their homes, some even holding their children, to go to the puppet township office and demand the release of Grandma. The enemy took Old Granny Gen out of the village towards the stronghold, and the women followed the enemy out of the village, arguing and shouting for the release of Grandma. The enemy refused to release her and used sticks to beat the women who were catching up. But they were not afraid of the beating and almost surrounded the enemy. The enemy forced a path with their sticks and took Grandma away.

    After Old Granny Gen was captured and taken to the enemy stronghold at Gao Hai, the enemy locked her in a room and began to interrogate her: "You have a cellar in your house, right? How many Eighth Route Army soldiers are hiding inside?"

    "There is a cellar, but it's for storing sweet potatoes, not for hiding people. You can go and see if you don't believe me," said Old Granny Gen.

    "You buried eleven guns and a rickshaw on Miaodong Mountain, and you led people to bury them."

    "If you know there are guns and a rickshaw there, why don't you go and dig them up? Why are you asking me?"

    "Isn't your house storing public grain for the Eighth Route Army, and fifty pairs of shoes?"

    "There is public grain and shoes, but the Eighth Route Army left long ago."

    "Wasn't Section Chief Wu from the county often staying at your house? Where is he now?"

    "I don't know Section Chief Wu, and I don't know where he is."

    A total of four enemies questioned her with that same set of questions until late at night, but they were all disappointed.

    The enemy became angry and called Old Granny Gen to another room. Without saying two words, they put handcuffs on her, pulled her handcuffed hands behind her back, hung her up with ropes, beat her with wooden sticks, and lit incense sticks to burn her armpits. The oil and blood from her burning armpits dripped down with a sizzling sound... Old Granny Gen did not scream; she remained steadfast and unyielding, saying, "I have nothing to say. I cannot betray my conscience. Even if I die, I will have a good name. Beat me, pull me, burn me to death. The meat is yours, but the bones are mine!..."

    Gao Xiaoshun, the puppet township head, stared with his wolf eyes: "You really have an iron mouth and a steel tongue. Everyone knows that if we catch you, we can get guns and bullets!"

    Old Granny Gen said: "As long as you don't cut off my tongue or tear out my heart, I will always reason with you. My house is not a gun and cannon factory, so where would the guns and bullets come from?"

    "Don't deny it, a hundred fingers are pointing at you!" said Gao Xiaoshun.

    "If anyone says I do, tell them to come and confront me!" said Old Granny Gen. But the vicious and poisonous landlords were afraid of the masses taking revenge on them, so no one dared to confront Old Granny Gen.

    Old Granny Gen fainted from the enemy's brutal beatings and incense burns. The enemy then loosened the ropes a little. After Old Granny Gen woke up from her unconsciousness, the enemy began her physical torture again: pulling, beating, and burning, continuing until the third crow of the rooster. Old Granny Gen died three times in one night, but the enemy did not get half a word of truth from her mouth.

    The next day, there was another night of torture, still with no results. They carried Old Granny Gen to an ordinary family's home and used soft tactics to try to reason with her, offering her cigarettes. Old Granny Gen hadn't eaten a grain of rice from the enemy in five days. Since Old Granny Gen was captured by the enemy, the adults and children of × Village were worried day and night, looking everywhere for people to bail her out. Later, they gave 1,500 catties of rice to rescue Grandma from the enemy's hands. Old Granny Gen's injuries were very serious, and she was recuperating in bed. Thanks to the care of the masses and the comrades from the county and district, her injuries quickly improved, and now she has started working with everyone in the village again. To avenge herself, she can never forget the enemy's crimes.

　　老根嫂
  　冀鲁豫坚持游击战争的故事
    敌人开始在临泽建立区乡伪组织，县区坚持游击战的同志们晚上常到×庄上来，妇会长老根嫂家成了工作同志的秘密家庭。老根嫂在村里论辈来说很多人都叫她老奶奶。
    一天下着小雨，老根嫂召集全村妇女开会，号召大家要保守秘密，大家都想着老奶奶的话“咱跟八路是一家人。”地主们却向敌人作了报告。这天伪乡公所把老根嫂抓住。老根嫂被敌人抓住的消息传到了每个妇女的耳朵里，她们都往家里走出来，还有的抱着孩子，到伪乡公所去要求放回老奶奶。敌人抓着老根嫂出村往据点里去，妇女们也跟随着敌人出了村，与敌人吵着、叫喊着放开老奶奶。敌人不放，用棒子打追赶上来的妇女们。但她们不怕打，几乎把敌人包围起来。敌人用棒子硬打开条路带去了老奶奶。
    老根嫂被抓到高海敌据点后，敌人把她关在屋里，于是就开始审问她：“你家有个地洞吧？那里边藏着几个八路军？”
    “有个洞，那是藏红薯用的，没藏过人，你不信就去看看。”老根嫂说。
    “你在庙东山埋着十一颗枪还有一辆洋车子也是你领着人埋的。”
    “你知道那里有枪、有车子为什么不去扒，还问我干啥？”
    “你家不是存着八路的公粮，还有五十双鞋子？”
    “公粮、鞋子都有，可是八路军早就起走了。”
    “县里吴科长不是常住你家，现在他在那里？”
    “俺不认得吴科长，也不知道他在那里。”
    一共四个敌人都问了她那一套，直问到深夜，但以后都失望了。
    敌人恼火了，把老根嫂叫到另一间房里，二句话没说，就给她带上手铐把带铐的双手拉到背后，用绳子吊起来，用木棍打，又点着一把火香烧她的两腋，腋下烧着的油和血水嗤嗤往下流……。老根嫂没有喊叫，她依然坚强不屈的说：“我没啥说，我不能坏良心，我死了也落个名，你打吧，拉吧，烧死我，肉是你的，骨头是我的！……”
    伪乡长高小顺在一旁瞪着两只狼眼睛：“你真是铁嘴钢舌头，谁都知道捉住你就有枪有子弹！”
    老根嫂说：“只要你割不了我的舌头，扒不了我的心，张嘴总要跟你讲理。我家没按着造枪炮厂，枪、子弹从那里来？”“不要不承认，有一百个指头指到你身上！”高小顺说。
    “谁说我有，叫他来跟我对对口！”老根嫂说。但凶恶狼毒的地主们，因为怕群众向他们复仇，谁也不敢跟老根嫂对口。
    老根嫂被敌人毒打香烧的昏过去了。敌人于是松了松绳子。老根嫂从昏迷中醒来以后，敌人又再次开始了对她的肉刑：拉、打、烧，闹到鸡叫三遍。老根嫂一夜死过去三次，敌人从她嘴里没得半句实话。
    第二天又是一夜的拷打，依然毫无结果。他们把老根嫂背到一家老百姓家，用软办法去找她说好话，给她点烟吸。老根嫂五天没吃敌人一粒米。自从老根嫂被敌人抓走后，×庄的大人小孩日夜胆心，到处找人去保她，后来出了一千五百斤米把老奶奶从敌人手里救了出来。老根嫂的伤很重，休养在床上。由于群众及县区同志们的爱护，她的伤势很快就好起来，现在又开始在村里和大伙儿一起工作起来了。为了复仇，她永远不能忘记敌人的罪行。
