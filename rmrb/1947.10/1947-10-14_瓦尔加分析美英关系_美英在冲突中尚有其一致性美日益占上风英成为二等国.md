Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: TASS Moscow, 2nd: In the latest issue of "World Economy and World Politics" magazine, Varga analyzes the contradictions between the US and the UK, stating: The current stage of US-UK relations is characterized by a combination of conflict and cooperation, with the United States increasingly gaining the upper hand and pushing the UK to a second-rate power position, after the US and the Soviet Union, in economic and political aspects. The United States now holds the same position in the capitalist world economy that Britain held in the 19th century, but the United States is different from 19th century Britain; it opposes the free import of foreign goods into its market. During the war, US industrial productivity increased; it is now unable to sell its products on the domestic market. The United States must drastically increase exports to avoid long-term stagnation of more than half of its industry and the formation of ten million permanently unemployed soldiers. Germany, Italy, and Japan have not yet participated in competition in the world market, and European countries can only purchase goods by relying on US credit loans. Therefore, the target of US capital competition is primarily aimed at Britain, especially at those conditions that guarantee preferential rights within the British Empire, such as the Sterling Area. The goal of the United States is to inherit the British Empire on a global scale. The change in the economic position of the United States has caused its foreign policy to change accordingly. The United States is trying to use its military power to make all countries in the world subordinate to it. Varga further pointed out: Although there are all these contradictions, US and UK foreign policy still has its consistency, that is, the US and the UK strive to jointly maintain the capitalist social system in order to deal with the Soviet Union's influence in various parts of the world. The special relationship between conflict and cooperation between the US and the UK has been demonstrated by the development surrounding the "Marshall Plan." On the one hand, this plan is beneficial to the UK, and the UK wants to obtain much-needed credit loans from the United States through it. On the other hand, the "Marshall Plan" deeply affects British interests. Based on this plan, the Western European group will exist under the dominance of the United States rather than the sole dominance of the UK. Therefore, its nature is purely anti-Soviet, and it cannot be used as a tool to defend the British Empire and imperial priorities from US encroachment. The restoration of the economic war potential of the western occupied zones of Germany will imply that the United States will replace Britain as the master of the Ruhr. The implementation of the Marshall Plan is undoubtedly a very important step in further turning Britain into a satellite state of the United States.

　　瓦尔加分析美英关系
  　美英在冲突中尚有其一致性美日益占上风英成为二等国
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社莫斯科二日讯：瓦尔加在最近一期之“世界经济与世界政治”杂志上分析英美矛盾时称：现阶段英美关系之特点，表现在冲突与合作之结合，而美国日益占了上风，且在经济政治诸方面把英国推到次于美苏两国的二等列强之地位。美国现今握有英国十九世纪占有资本主义世界经济的同样地位，但美国与十九世纪的英国不同；它是反对外货自由输入其市场的。战争期间，美国工业生产力提高了；现已不能在国内市场上售出其产品。美国必须急剧提高输出，才能避免一半多工业之长期停顿及一千万永久失业军之形成，德、意、日三国迄今未参加竞争世界市场，而欧洲各国又只有依靠美国信用贷款方能购买货品。因此，美国资本的竞争对象，首先就是针对着英国，特别是针对着那些保证大英帝国内部优先权的条件，如英镑集团等等。美国的目的在于继承不列颠在全世界范围的帝国。美国经济地位的改变，使它的外交政策也随着改变。美国正试图利用其军事力量，使世界上一切国家都隶属于它。瓦尔加进而指出：虽然有这一切矛盾，可是英美间的外交政策尚有其一致性，即美英力求共同维持资本主义的社会制度，以对付苏联在世界各地的影响。英美间冲突与合作之特殊关系，已由围绕着“马歇尔计划”的发展表现出来了。一方面这计划对英国有利，英国想通过它自美国获取其所急需之信用贷款。另一方面“马歇尔计划”深深地影响到英国利益。基于这一计划，西欧集团会在美国而非在英国独霸下生存。因此其性质是纯粹反苏的，而它不可能被用作防卫不列颠帝国及帝国优先权免受美国侵害之工具。德国西部占领区经济战争潜力的恢复将暗示：美国会取英国而代之，成为鲁尔之主人。马歇尔计划的实现，无疑是进一步变英国为美国的卫星国的一个非常重要之步骤。
