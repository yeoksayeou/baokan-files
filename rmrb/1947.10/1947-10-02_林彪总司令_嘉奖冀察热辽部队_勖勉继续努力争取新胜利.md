Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 30th: Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army recently commended and慰勉the meritorious troops and commanders of Ji-Cha-Re-Liao for annihilating the main force of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit 49th Army and achieving an unprecedented victory, saying: "Congratulations on your great victory in annihilating the main force of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit 49th Army. I hope you will continue your efforts to achieve new victories!"

Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Cha-Re-Liao, 30th: To celebrate the two great victories in western Liaoning, annihilating 16,000 enemies, the CPC Central Committee Ji-Cha-Re-Liao Sub-Bureau, Ji-Cha-Re-Liao Military Region, Rehe Provincial Government, and the Rehe Provincial Construction Association, etc., sent a message to all the officers and soldiers at the front line, saying: "At this time of the national counter-offensive, our Ji-Cha-Re-Liao People's Liberation Army has won two consecutive great victories. The news of the triumph is encouraging to both the military and the people. Now, inside and outside the Great Wall, north and south of the Great River, between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, and the Yellow River, our mighty army is sweeping across Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in the provinces of Qin, Jin, Yu, and Lu, saving the people. The bright future is getting closer and closer, and the destruction of Chiang Kai-shek is getting faster and faster. We will see the banner of liberation planted all over the country. We hope you will continue your efforts to annihilate the enemy in large numbers and strive for greater victories. Our entire region's people are determined to redouble their efforts, step up production, carry out land reform, and fully support you!"

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 30th: This agency's reporter Yang Geng commented on the annihilation of the main force of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit 49th Army, saying: The bandit leader Chen Cheng has been in office for less than a month, and the first achievement under his direct deployment and command was the annihilation of the main force of the 49th Army. This is truly worse than the last.

It is also pathetic to say that Chen Cheng, putting on an act, came to the Northeast, vainly attempting to reorganize the "foundation" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in the Northeast. However, the 49th Army, which he added as capital for selling his life, was so useless. At that time, Wang Tiehan, who had been captured by the People's Liberation Army in the Rugao battle last July and had luckily escaped, shamelessly said when he led his troops to the Northeast this time: "This time, the 49th Army was transferred to support the Northeast in order to encourage the morale of the defeated troops in the Northeast and to recover the loss of the military spirit of the Northeast troops" (I seized Wang bandit's speech to the bandit army on August 28 in a captured enemy officer's diary). However, history is a ruthless witness. Any clown who betrays the people of the Northeast and joins the traitor Chiang Kai-shek will eventually be severely punished by the people of the Northeast. This time, nearly 10,000 of the 49th Division were captured, which shows that these soldiers are unwilling to sell their lives for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Therefore, in the battle of Yang Zhangzi, they collectively laid down their weapons. This also shows that Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to use their old Northeast Army as cannon fodder is not only futile, but will also fail more miserably!

  　嘉奖冀察热辽部队
  　勖勉继续努力争取新胜利
    【新华社东北三十日电】东北民主联军林总司令顷嘉奖并慰勉冀察热辽歼灭蒋匪四十九军主力，获得空前大捷之有功部队和指战员称：“庆祝你们歼灭蒋匪四十九军主力的伟大胜利，望继续努力，争取新的胜利！”
    【新华社冀察热辽三十日电】为庆贺辽西两次大捷，歼敌一万六千人，中共中央冀察热辽分局冀察热辽军区暨热河省政府、热河省建联会等驰骋前线全体将士称：值此全国反攻之际，我冀察热辽人民解放军连获两次大捷，凯音传来，军民振奋，现在长城内外，大河南北，江淮河汉之间秦晋豫鲁诸省我雄师横扫蒋匪，拯救人民，光明前途愈近，蒋贼覆灭益速，行见解放大旗即将插遍全国，望再接再厉，大量歼灭敌人，争取更大胜利，我全区人民决以百倍之努力，加紧生产，进行土改，全力支援你们！”
    【新华社东北前线三十日电】本社记者杨赓评蒋匪四十九军主力的被歼灭称：匪首陈诚走马上任不到一个月，在他的直接部署和指挥之下的第一个建树，便是四十九军主力的歼灭。这真是一蟹不如一蟹。
    说来也很可怜，装模作样的陈诚来到东北后，妄想重整东北蒋家匪帮的“基业”，而其添加起来的卖命本钱四十九军，却是那样的不顶事。那时候被人民解放军去年七月在如皋战役中俘获侥悻偷跑了的王铁汉，这次率领部队到东北来的时候，还在死不要脸的说：“这次四十九军调援东北是为了鼓励东北受挫部队的士气，是为了挽回东北部队军风的丧失”（我缴获敌军官日记中所有王匪在八月二十八日对匪军的讲话）。然而历史是无情的证人，出卖东北人民投靠卖国匪首蒋介石的任何小丑终于受到了东北人民的严惩。四十九师这回就俘的就将近一万，就说明这些士兵是不甘心替蒋家匪帮卖命的，所以杨仗子的一战，他们集合的放下了武器。这又说明了蒋介石妄想利用他们旧东北军，当炮灰其结果不是徒劳，而且要失败得更惨！
