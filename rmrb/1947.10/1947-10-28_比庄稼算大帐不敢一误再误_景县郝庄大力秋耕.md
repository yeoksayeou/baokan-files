　　【Jinan News, Hebei Province, 26th Dispatch】Under the slogan "Resting the Land is Like Resting a Horse," Haozhuang Village in the Third District of Jingxian County is vigorously engaged in autumn cultivation. On the 12th of this month, the village production committee convened a meeting of all mutual aid teams to discuss the autumn harvest. The masses had various opinions on autumn cultivation, such as: "What's the hurry? Isn't it easy to cultivate?" "Making money in business is readily available." "Let's talk about it after the threshing is done." "The animals should rest." The leadership immediately proposed the slogan "Resting the land is like resting a horse" and "Early autumn cultivation, late spring cultivation," and divided everyone into groups to enlighten them and start discussions, comparing the land cultivated last year with the land cultivated this spring. Liu Honggang said, "My mutual aid did not disband last year, and all seven mu of land were cultivated. This spring, my land produced full seedlings, and the crops were much stronger than theirs." Hongzhang said, "I didn't cultivate two mu of land, and it was dry when sowing this year. I sowed three times and nothing came out. Later, the land became barren." Jin Ting said, "Four mu of land in the northeast of our village were only cultivated this spring. The land was dry and the clods were large. Nothing grew after planting, and some ridges were eaten by mole crickets. There are many mole crickets in newly cultivated land." Another person surnamed Liu said, "I only cultivated the land this spring. No seedlings came out after sowing, and those that did were blown away by the wind." Liu Jinsheng only cared about doing business and delayed the land, so the crops were planted poorly. Everyone spoke enthusiastically. In total, 170 mu of land in 30 households in the village were not cultivated in the autumn last year; each mu yielded 30 jin less than the autumn-cultivated land, for a total loss of 4,500 jin of grain. After this comparison, the households that did not cultivate in the autumn felt they had suffered a great loss. They then further discussed how to complete the autumn cultivation this year. It was calculated that there were still 490 mu of autumn land in the village, and each mutual aid team immediately formulated plans based on the number of animals and land area. For example, Liu Hongzhang's team had 25 mu of autumn-cultivated land (including six mu of yam and cotton land), and one draft animal. They decided: 1. To cultivate the existing stubble land in seven days, and cultivate the six and a half mu of yam and cotton land after digging it up. 2. To ensure deep and careful cultivation, not exceeding three mu of land per day. 3. To use noontime for threshing, and continue plowing the land in the afternoon; to use human power for grinding. Other teams also made their own plans. Now, the masses in the village are threshing while engaging in autumn cultivation, and more than 50 mu have been cultivated.

　　【Jinan News, Hebei Province, 26th Dispatch】Li Xiaozhuang in the Seventh District of Wuyi County expanded mutual aid to plant wheat and cultivate in the autumn. In addition to the five old mutual aid teams such as Li Weiyi's, 20 new mutual aid teams were temporarily formed for wheat planting. A total of 76 households and 147 people participated in the new and old mutual aid. They divided labor specifically by team and livestock power; they further divided labor according to the size of the work and the size of the labor force and the urgency of the work, which was very effective. For example, Li Fengqi's team, with only one animal for three families and 61 mu of land, planted 42 mu of wheat. When planting wheat, the animal only managed the cultivation, and all the odd jobs were done by manpower. Each team also planted wheat on 119 mu for elderly, weak, widowed, and orphaned households who were not in the teams. "Before the White Dew Festival, the whole village had planted 1,574 mu of wheat, with an average of more than 2.5 mu of wheat planted per person. The masses all said, "If we plant, we will harvest, and there will be no difficulty in getting through the spring famine next year." On October 10th, village cadres and mutual aid team leaders held a meeting to summarize wheat planting and discuss seedling protection and autumn cultivation. Everyone unanimously felt that without mutual aid, there would be a shortage of people or animals, and no one could plant so quickly. Li Guozhen said, "There are a lot of locusts this year, and seedling protection is still a concern." Li Shiting said, "As long as the land is clean (referring to the crops being harvested and the land cultivated), the locusts will have nowhere to hide. Even if they don't die, they will be easy to catch." Li Weiyi said, "Early autumn cultivation, late spring cultivation. This year is wet, and the weather is getting cold early. Early cultivation will make it easier to sow next spring." Everyone immediately made new plans for seedling protection and autumn cultivation. Seventy-six animals and forty plows in the village immediately began autumn cultivation, cultivating the black soil first and then the white soil (because the black soil dries easily). They guaranteed to cultivate 1,308 mu of land in half a month. At the same time, the remaining labor force and women and children were also mobilized to participate in threshing and other odd jobs.

    比庄稼算大帐不敢一误再误
    景县郝庄大力秋耕
    【本报冀南二十六日电】在“歇地如歇马”的口号下，景县三区郝庄大力秋耕。本月十二日，该村生产委员会召开全体互助组会议讨论秋收时，群众对秋耕有各种说法，如：“慌啥，还不好耕吗？”“做买卖赚个钱是现成的。”“场打完了再说。”“牲口该歇歇了。”领导上当即提出：“歇地如歇马”，“早秋耕晚春耕”的口号，并分组启发大家，展开讨论，把去年耕的地和今春耕的地做对比。刘洪刚说：“我去年互助没有散，七亩地都耕过来，今春我的地出的都是满苗，庄稼比他们强的多。”洪章说：“我有二亩地没耕，今年耩时干了，耩了三回也没出，后来地荒了。”金廷说：“我村东北四亩地，今春才耕，地干坷拉大，种上也没出，有几垄也叫蝼蛄吃了，新耕的地蝼蛄多。”又一个姓刘的说：“我今春才耕地，耩上没苗，出来的也给风刮死了。”刘金声光顾做买卖，把地耽误了，庄稼种的二郎八旦。大家你一言我一语说的很热烈。总计去年全村有三十户的地一百七十亩没有秋耕；一亩地比秋耕地要少收三十斤，共少收四千五百斤粮食。经过这一对比，没秋耕的户觉得吃了大亏。随又进一步讨论今年如何完成秋耕。合计全村尚有秋地四百九十亩，各互助组即根据牲口地亩纷订计划。如刘洪章组秋耕地二十五亩（山药、棉花地六亩在内），一犋牲口，他们决定：一、在七天把现有的茬子地耕完，六亩半山药、棉花地刨了就耕。二、保证深耕细做，一天不超过三亩地。三、打场利用晌午，下午仍然犁地；推碾推磨用人力。其他各组也都订出自己计划。现该村群众一面打场，一面秋耕，已耕好了五十余亩。
    【本报冀南二十六日电】武邑七区李小庄扩大互助种麦秋耕。该村种麦中除李维一等五个老互助组外，又临时结合了二十个新互助，参加新老互助的共七十六户，一百四十七人。他们以组为单位，人畜力具体分工；根据活大小及劳动力大小及活的紧慢再具体分工，收效很大。如李凤歧组，三家只有一个牲口，六十一亩地，就种了麦子四十二亩。种麦子时牲口光管耕地，做杂活全用人力。各组并给不在组的老弱孤寡户种麦一百一十九亩。“白露节前，全村已种麦一千五百七十四亩，每人平均种麦二亩半多。群众都说：“得种得收，渡过明年春荒没有困难了。”十月十日村干及互助组长开会总结种麦，并讨论保苗、秋耕，大家一致感觉要不互助起来，不是缺人就是缺牲口，谁家也种不了这么快。李国贞说：“今年蚂蚱不少，保苗还是个事。”李石廷说：“只要净了地（指庄稼收完，地耕好）蚂蚱没处藏了，就是不死也好逮。”李维一说：“早秋耕，晚春耕，今年湿，天冷早，早耕过来明春好下种。”大家随即订新的保苗秋耕计划。全村七十六条牲口，四十张犁，立即开始秋耕，先耕黑土地，后耕白土地（因黑土地好风干）。一千三百零八亩地，保证半月耕完。同时剩余的劳力和妇女小孩，也一齐动员，参加打场及做其他零活。
