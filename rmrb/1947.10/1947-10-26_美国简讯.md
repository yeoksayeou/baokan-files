　　American Briefs
    New York late dispatch: American political commentator Staurobin, in the American Communist Party's publication "Political Affairs," analyzed the attitude of the American bourgeoisie towards the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, stating that the American bourgeoisie can be divided into two parts. One part is the oil industry and the war industry, which can immediately obtain huge profits from the expansionist policy, and therefore supports the Truman Doctrine. The second part is small and medium-sized enterprises, which bear the main cost of American foreign expenditures, but now get nothing in return, and therefore oppose it.
    The majority of the American people, the so-called birthplace of the "Marshall Plan," have no idea what it is. According to the conservative Gallup "Public Opinion Measurement Institute," recently published, 51 percent of Americans have never heard of it, and those who have previously known little about this plan, upon hearing that ten billion dollars (note: far more than ten billion!) would be used to aid Europe, almost completely oppose this plan.
    A recent survey conducted by U.S. Newsweek reflects that more than half of the reporters (mainly American reporters) covering the UN General Assembly believe that American policy is not helpful to the United Nations. Of the forty-five interviewees, only five believe that the current U.S. policy in the UN General Assembly "strengthens" the United Nations.

　　美国简讯
    纽约迟到消息，美政论家斯塔罗滨在美共出版的“政治问题”杂志上分析美国资产阶级对杜鲁门主义及马歇尔计划的态度时称：美国资产阶级中可分为两部分，一部分是石油工业与战争工业，它们能立刻从扩张政策中获得厚利，因此支持杜鲁门主义；其次是中小企业，他们分担美国对外支出之主要费用，但现在却一无所得，因此持反对态度。
    所谓“马歇尔计划”策源地之美国大部人民根本不知有这回事。据保守的盖洛普“民意测念所”最近公布，美人中有百分之五十一从未听见过、从前很少知道这计划的人听说要拿十亿元（按：何止十亿！）援欧，几乎根本反对这一计划。
    美国新闻周刊最近所举行的测验反映，采访联大消息的记者（主要是美国记者）中有一半以上认为美国政策对联合国没有帮助。在被测验的四十五个访员中，只有五人认为美国目前在联大中的政策是“加强了”联合国。
