　　Pay Attention to Organizing Semi-Auxiliary Labor
  　Finish Harvesting Crops in Ten Days
  　Zhang Jiuming Brigade Assigns Special Personnel to Start Sod-Turning
    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 22nd] The Zhang Jiuming Mutual Aid Brigade in Zhangma Village, Qinshui, led by the core of hired poor peasants, organized all full and semi-labor forces of women and children to participate in the autumn harvest. In ten days, they completed the harvesting of 2,700 mu of millet and corn in the entire village. Before the autumn harvest, the Zhang Jiuming Brigade paid attention to the leading role of the poor and hired peasants, adjusted the cadres, and among the 32 mutual aid group leaders, 5 joint group leaders, and 5 inspectors, except for 5 middle peasants, the rest were all poor and hired peasants. This year's autumn grain is the result of supporting the self-defense war and fighting arduously against natural disasters such as drought, locust plagues, and floods. Therefore, they attached great importance to the autumn harvest from the outset. In order to overcome the difficulty of a large number of laborers supporting the war, Zhang Jiuming, the brigade leader, and Shang Mingzhi, the village head, convened a meeting of cadres above the group leader level on September 20th to study the organization of semi-labor forces and proposed, "Women should get out of bed during the spring and autumn busy seasons," "Only women who cultivate and weave are heroes!" Zhang Jiuming also called on cadres to organize meritorious services. Subsequently, after the core of hired poor peasants conducted in-depth mobilization and individual talks, they organized 244 full-labor women, 187 semi-labor women, 154 children, and 24 old men in two days, achieving 100% organization. In order to prevent various material shortages from affecting the autumn harvest, the brigade also proposed, "If you want the autumn harvest to be stress-free, prepare everything properly." Starting on September 22nd, they transported more than 200 carts of charcoal and repaired 95 granaries in two days. They also repaired the grain transport roads and prepared sickles, baskets, and furniture. The entire brigade started the autumn harvest on September 25th. Except for rainy days, in the ten days up to October 12th, they completed the harvesting of all 1,246 mu of millet and 1,472 mu of corn in the entire village. During the harvest, the morale of the masses was very high. Their slogans were: "Harvest quickly, harvest well, work in the dark, get up early." Each group went to the fields to harvest before the roosters crowed. For example, Zhang Jiujin's group of nine people finished cutting more than ten mu of corn before dawn, doing half a day's work. Zhang Xuezhou's group of five people cut four mu of corn at night; Zhang Jiumu's group cut more than ten mu. During the day, they formed groups everywhere along the rivers and ridges, burying themselves in cutting millet, with cattle pulling and people carrying, creating a lively scene. In particular, for the families of militiamen, laborers, military cadres, and revolutionary martyrs who participated in the war, everyone shouted, "The army and laborers are working on the front lines, and we are models in the rear." Each group challenged and competed with each other. On September 25th alone, they cut all 500 mu of millet for the 76 households of military cadres, revolutionary martyrs, militiamen, and laborers in the entire village; on October 7th, they harvested another 600 mu of corn. Women, old men, and children played a significant role, bearing nearly seven-tenths of the workload. As joint group leader Wang Xuezhou said, "If it weren't for the women's participation in our group, we wouldn't have finished cutting by now." The group he led planted a total of 50 mu of millet, 47 mu of corn, and some miscellaneous fields. All four full laborers in the group participated in the war for a long time, and two of them were gone. The remaining two were also constantly on short assignments. They relied entirely on the eleven women and children in the group to complete the harvesting of millet and cutting of corn in nine days. During the harvest, many women models emerged, such as Cheng Xiuying, Wang Wan, and Gao Fu, who carried corn alongside the men and never lagged behind. Cai Guixiang, Liu Zhenqi, and others cut millet and corn faster than the men. Now, they continue to divide the work, with young people carrying grain to the threshing ground, women and children cutting beans and harvesting late autumn crops, and organizing old men to plow the land, striving to have all the autumn land completely sod-turned this year.

　　注意组织半辅劳力
  　十天就把庄稼收完
  　张九铭大队抽出专人开始垡地
    【本报太岳廿二日电】沁水张马村张九铭互助大队，在雇贫骨干带领下，组织了妇女儿童所有全半劳力投入收秋，十天已将全村二千七百亩谷、玉茭收割完毕。在秋收以前，张九铭大队，即注意了贫雇的领导作用，调整了干部，在三十二个互助小组长、五个联合组长、五个检查员中，除五个中农以外，其余都是贫雇农。他们今年的秋粮，是经过支援自卫战争，并与旱、蝗、涝等天灾作艰苦斗争的成果。因此，他们对于秋收，事前就非常重视，为了克服大批劳力支援战争的困难，大队长张九铭、村长尚明智等，在九月二十日，即召开小组长以上干部会议，研究组织半劳力，提出“春忙秋忙，妇女下床”，“女耕女织才是英雄”！张九铭并号召各干部组织立功。随后又经过雇贫骨干，深入动员，个别谈话，两天组织起妇女全劳力二百四十四人，半劳力一百八十七人，儿童一百五十四人，老汉二十四人，百分之百组织起来。为使秋收中不遭受到各种物件缺乏的影响，大队又提出：“要想秋收不着慌，一切准备作停当。”于九月廿二日开始，两天中运炭二百余车，修好粮仓九十五个，又修好运粮车路，镰筐家具都准备停当，全大队自九月二十五日开始收秋，除下雨外，至十月十二日的十天中，即将全村一千二百四十六亩谷、一千四百七十二亩玉茭全部收完。在收割中，群众情绪非常高涨，他们的口号是：“收快、收好，摸黑、起早。”各组鸡不叫即上地收割。如张九金小组九个人，在天明以前即刹完十余亩玉茭，顶做半天的活。张学周小组五人，黑夜刹玉茭四亩；张九隅小组刹了十余亩。白天沿河沿岭到处结伙成群埋头割谷，牛拉、人担，闹的热火朝天。特别是为参战民兵、民夫、军干烈属收割，大家喊出：“军队民夫前方干，咱们后方为模范。”各组互相挑战竞赛，九月二十五日一天，即将全村七十六户军干烈属、民兵、民夫家庭的五百亩谷子割完；十月七日，又将六百亩玉茭收完。妇女、老汉、儿童，起了很大作用，她们差不多负担了十分之七的工。正如联合组长王学周说：“我组要不是妇女动手，到现在还割不完。”他所领导的那个小组，共种谷五十亩，玉茭四十七亩，还有些杂田，全组四个全劳力，长期参战的即去了两个，其余两个也是短差不断，全靠组内十一个妇女、儿童，九天完成了收谷刹玉茭。在收割中，涌现出许多妇女模范，如程秀英、王万、高福，担玉茭随上了男人，一回也不落后。蔡桂香、刘珍期等，割谷子、玉茭比男人还做的快。现在，他们仍继续分工，青年担谷打场，妇女儿童割豆打晚秋，并组织老汉掌犁垡地，争取今年秋地完全垡光。
