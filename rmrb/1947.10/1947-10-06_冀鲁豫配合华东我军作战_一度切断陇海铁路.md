　　Ji-Lu-Yu Coordinates with East China Our Army in Operations
 　　Once Cutting Off the Longhai Railway
    [This Dispatch from Ji-Lu-Yu, 4th] To actively coordinate with the East China Field Army in operations, the local armed forces of the Fifth Sub-district of Ji-Lu-Yu launched a full-scale attack, sabotaging the civilian labor sections of the Longhai Railway to cut off the enemy's supply lines and create favorable conditions for annihilating the Chiang troops. Before the East China Field Army annihilated Chiang’s reorganized 57th Division, the local armed forces of our Fifth Sub-district advanced to the Longhai Railway on the evening of September 7th, destroying fifteen *li* of the railway between Xiaodianpu and Zhaozhuang, between Minquan and Liuhe. They also harvested all the electrical wires in that section. On the 11th, they destroyed the Minquan and Yejigang stations, as well as nine *li* of the railway near Wangzhuang, cutting off most of the electrical wires. In total, 24 *li* of the railway were destroyed, preventing enemy traffic for several days and completely cutting off the Xu-Bian supply line. After completing the sabotage mission, the Eighth Regiment, with one of its companies, cleverly and bravely swiftly penetrated the enemy's solid stronghold in the Neihuang district headquarters, annihilating all the defending enemy forces, injuring 15 enemy soldiers, capturing 5 enemy soldiers, and seizing 16 rifles and pistols and 600 rounds of ammunition. To expand the results of the battle, the regiment took advantage of the victory and used one of its companies to attack the puppet district headquarters in Hongmiao, north of Lanfeng, capturing 4 enemy soldiers, seizing 12 rifles and 5 mules and horses, while suffering no casualties. The armed forces of Dongming and Nanhua counties, coordinating with the sabotage of the Longhai Railway and striking the enemy entering and exiting the hinterland, also captured prisoners on the 14th. In an ambush at Beixiaoying, they completely resolved the enemy forces emerging from Baimao in just five minutes, seizing 14 rifles. The Kaocheng Brigade attacked the Sanying Village stronghold north of Lanfeng on the 4th, and then attacked the Shaogang stronghold southeast of Kaocheng on the 9th, capturing a total of 21 enemy soldiers, killing 23 enemy soldiers, and seizing one light machine gun and five rifles. The area of fifty *li* in length and width from Minquan to Kaocheng is now completely under our control. The military region headquarters believes that the local armed forces of the Fifth Sub-district actively coordinated with the main forces in operations, attacking the enemy on the Longhai Line, and achieved significant results, and specially commended them.
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 3rd] Delayed news: A part of the Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "Liberation Army" southeast of Xuzhou, north of Huai, fiercely attacked more than 300 Chiang's security forces and others who disturbed Guan Town on September 13 in the area south of Sixian, annihilating a part of them. Our army then took advantage of the victory and captured Guan Town and Baoji in one fell swoop on the 14th, capturing nearly 100 Chiang’s Sixian Security Corps platoon leaders and below, seizing one small cannon, five light machine guns, and one hundred rifles.
