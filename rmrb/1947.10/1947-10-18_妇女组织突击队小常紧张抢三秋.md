　　Women's Organized Shock Brigade in Xiaochang Tensely Rushes the Three Autumn Harvests
    [This Dispatch from Lucheng] In Xiaochang Village, Fourth District, leading cadres conducted a Three Rushes mobilization, proposing "Autumn harvest is like fighting a war, men, women, old, and young all go into action together." At the meeting, a woman named Shi Aiying suggested: Let's organize the women to help the men with the autumn harvest. The active woman Liu Guoxian launched the organization of a women's shock brigade, organizing a total of 26 women. They divided into two groups, and in addition to working for themselves, they went to other people's homes to sell their labor. In seven days, they harvested a total of 365 mu of grain. Each woman harvested an average of 1.8 mu of grain per day. Everyone automatically set appropriate wages while harvesting: one and a half sheng of millet with meals provided per mu, and two sheng of millet per mu without meals provided. They earned a total of seven point three shi of millet in wages. The village has 842.5 mu of grain land. The number of mu of grain harvested by women selling their labor accounted for 40 percent of the entire village. This influenced the male semi-labor force (children and the elderly) to become active as well, proposing "Children and the elderly pick hemp, striving to turn over the autumn land early." Military dependent Li Jinshan said: "I am 61 years old this year. I participated in the mutual aid group to plant wheat, and I am not worried about the autumn harvest. The wheat has already been planted, and I guarantee that I will not need anyone else to farm for me." The male full-labor force is currently rushing to plant wheat on one hand and formulating autumn plowing plans on the other. The village has 1,850 mu of autumn land and 48 head of livestock. Each plow turns four mu of land per day, for a total of 96 mu of land plowed per day. They will complete the autumn plowing in 20 days. The men, women, old, and young of the village are vigorously rushing to harvest and preparing to rush to plow. (Shen You, Duan Lang)
