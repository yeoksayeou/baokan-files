　　Lingdong Base Point Inspects Autumn Plowing
  　Groups Go to the Fields to See Which Village is Best
    [This newspaper Changzhi News] The Lingdong Base Point in the Second District held a meeting of village cadres and activists on October 19th to study autumn plowing and autumn storage. During the casual conversation, the former village head of Yuan Village proposed: "Today, let's divide up and go to eight villages to inspect and study to see which village is well-organized and does a good job in the fields." Everyone agreed that the inspection was to promote the work, and immediately divided into four groups, each group selected a leader to lead the way, starting the inspection at 8 am and concentrating at the height of the sun in the afternoon. The former village head of Yuan Village, covered in sweat, said: "Inspection can really open up thinking. At the meeting, they talked about how good the Juyou Group was in Guguan. I never believed it. Today, I saw with my own eyes that the whole group had twelve women, four children, two unmarried girls, three young people, two old men, and an old woman, all digging with great effort. Wang Haiyu's mother is over sixty years old and digging with sweat all over her head." The chairman of the Langjia Farmers' Association said: "The Juyou Group's wage determination is really fair. Livestock households, in order to finish plowing the land early, engage in transportation, drawing a portion of the rice earned by the livestock to reward women, rewarding two points for digging one mu, and dividing the profits by two or eight with the family. The whole village has two big flags and forty towels, with a three-day plan and one concentration. For each red flag won, five towels are awarded, promoting the whole village's nine groups of one hundred and twenty-one women to go to the fields completely." The director of the Yuan Village Women's Rescue Association said: "The Juyou Group erected a big red flag in the field. I asked the daughters-in-law if their hands hurt? Everyone stretched out their hands, covered with countless blisters. The women all said: 'To earn rice, our hands don't hurt.' Inspecting their whole group of more than four qing of land, only one qing and twenty mu have not been plowed, and they will be able to complete it before the tenth of the month." After everyone communicated, they unanimously agreed to learn from the Juyou Group. On the spot, the lagging village cadres made a four-day plan, promising to fully organize and complete it before the tenth of the month, with a major inspection on the eleventh to see who is better.
