Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Shanghai News: The American agricultural invasion plan to turn China into a raw material supply base is now being actively implemented by the Chiang bandit Nanjing government. The Chiang bandit "National Economic Commission" passed a "1948 Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Program" on the 2nd, allowing American capital and American technology to directly control Chinese agriculture, in order to facilitate American plunder of Chinese agriculture.

It is reported that the plan was formulated entirely in accordance with the "Raw Material China" plan formulated after the American "Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group" came to China twice last June and this February for "investigation." When the "Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group" arrived in China last June, the head of the group, Mr. H.H. Hazen, announced that the purpose of his visit to China was to study the increased production of Chinese wool, tung oil, silk, and tea needed by American industry and daily use. The group traveled to fifteen provinces in the hinterland of our country. After returning to Nanjing in October, it published a "Sino-American Agricultural Cooperation Plan" (or "China Agricultural Construction Plan"). The main content was to develop raw material products needed by the United States with American "technology," the so-called "export products." It also advocated that the "Farmers Bank" and "Cooperative Treasury" of the four major families should be merged and reorganized into an "Agricultural Bank" to manipulate rural finance. Furthermore, an "Agricultural Control Bureau" should be established under the Chiang family's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to control production and sales, in order to facilitate America's low-price plunder of these raw materials. The group returned to the United States in November and sent the report to the US-Chiang government. According to a Washington dispatch from the US News Agency on February 25 this year, the US government has approved the report, and the Chiang bandit government also expressed its acceptance and welcomed American "experts" to China for "assistance." On February 22 this year, nine members of the group came to China again under the name of "American Agricultural Investigation Group" to make further arrangements for their invasion plan. On August 26, this group of "experts" published a "China Agricultural Plan" in Washington, the content of which was roughly the same as the previous plan. The method of "encouraging the production of Chinese agricultural exports" was determined as establishing fertilizer factories, developing irrigation, improving varieties, adjusting foreign exchange, reducing transportation costs, and reiterating the proposal to establish an "Agricultural Bank." All of these nakedly exposed the American imperialists' eagerness to invade Chinese agriculture by directly intervening in Chinese agricultural production. The "Program" passed by the Chiang bandit "National Economic Commission" on the 2nd is to completely and gradually realize this invasion plan of its American masters without any changes.

As early as November 1945, in the "International Trade Proposal" submitted by the United States to the United Nations, the United States had determined the policy of taking China as a "raw material commodity exporting country" and at the same time began its steps to directly intervene in Chinese agriculture. Since the surrender of Japan, the "land reclamation" and "joint ventures" carried out by the Chiang bandit authorities in agriculture through large-scale plunder of farmers' land are actually carried out under the control of American capital and American technology. The so-called "Chinese agricultural mechanization" is, in fact, "Americanization." The United States, through the joint establishment of the "Agricultural Reclamation Office" controlled by American capital by the Chiang bandit Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Executive Yuan, and the "Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Committee" composed of the four ministries of Agriculture and Forestry, Food, Transportation, and Economy of the Chiang bandits, with the American side of the "United Relief" as the main body, plus the assistance of the so-called "Agricultural Voluntary Service Corps" of the American Christian Brotherhood in China, the United States has made great progress in directly controlling Chinese agriculture. The "Agricultural Machinery Factory" directly under the "Agricultural Reclamation Office," whose technology is controlled by Americans, is set up in various provinces and cities of the Chiang-controlled areas. Members of the "Agricultural Voluntary Service Corps" are scattered throughout the Chiang-occupied areas of Northeast China and Guizhou, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu and other provinces. The "Cooperative Farms" formed by the "Yellow River Flood Committee" with more than 4 million mu of farmland "concentrated" by the Chiang bandit authorities in three counties in northern Anhui, the operating capital and tools are also completely planned and responsible by the United States. The scale and depth of the progress of American control of Chinese agricultural work can be seen from this. After the Chiang bandit authorities formulated the "Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Program," this situation will intensify.

　　蒋贼出卖中国农业
  　奉迎美国鬼子吮吸农民膏血
    【新华社陕北八日电】上海消息：美国沦中国为原料供应地之农业侵略计划，现正为蒋匪南京政府积极奉行中。蒋匪“全国经济委员会”已于二日通过一“三十七年度中美农业技术合作计划方案”，允许由美国资本与美国技术直接控制中国农业，以便利美国对中国农业之掠夺。据悉，该方案系完全依照美国“中美农业技术合作团”去年六月及今年二月两度来华“考察”后，所拟定之“原料中国”计划而订定。去年六月“中美农业技术合作团”到达中国，该团团长赫契生曾宣布其来华目的即为研究美国工业及日用所需的中国羊毛、桐油、丝、茶之增产。该团遍游我国腹地十五省，十月回到南京后，发表一“中美农业合作计划”（或称“中国农业建设计划”）主要内容为以美国“技术”发展美国所需的原料产品，即所谓“外销产品”，并主张由四大家族之“农民银行”及“合作金库”合并改组“农业银行”，以操纵农村金融，再于蒋家农林部下设“农业管制局”控制产销，以便利于美国对该项原料之贱价掠夺。该团十一月返美，将该报告书分送美蒋政府，据今年二月二十五日美新闻处华盛顿电：美政府已批准该报告书，蒋匪政府亦表示接受，欢迎美国“专家”来华“协助”。今年二月二十二日，该团团员九人又以“美国农业考察团”之名来华，对其侵略计划作更进一步的布署。至八月二十六日该批“专家”又在华盛顿发表一“中国农业计划”，其内容与前一计划大致相同，将“鼓励中国农业输出品生产”之办法确定为建立肥料工厂，发展灌溉，改良品种，调整外汇，减低运输费用，并重申建立“农业银行”之主张。所有这些，皆赤裸裸地暴露了美国帝国主义急于以直接插足中国农业生产的方式侵略中国农业的野心。蒋匪“全国经济委员会”二日所通过之“方案”，即为将其美国主子此一侵略计划完全不变地逐步实现起来。按早在一九四五年十一月美国向联合国所作之“国际贸易建议书”中，美国即已确定将中国作为“原料商品输出国的方针，同时即开始其直接插足中国农业之步骤。自日本投降以来蒋匪当局借大规模掠夺农民土地在农业上所进行之“屯垦”“合营”实际皆系在美国资本与美国技术控制下进行者，所谓“中国农业机械化”，事实上就是“美国化”。美国通过蒋匪农林部与行总合组由美国资本控制之“农垦处”，与以“联总”美国方面为主体而由蒋匪农林、粮食、交通、经济四部组成之“黄泛区复兴委员会”两机构，加上美国基督教兄弟会在华会员组织之所谓“农业义务服务团”的协助，美国在直接控制中国农业上已获得极大进展，仅“农垦处”直辖技术上由美人控制之“农械厂”即遍设蒋区各省市，“农业义务服务团”团员更遍布东北蒋占区及桂、豫、鄂、苏等省，“黄泛复委会”经蒋匪当局在皖北三县强迫“集中”农田四百余万亩组成之庞大“合作农场”，经营资本与工具亦系完全由美方统筹和负责。美国控制中国农业工作进展之规模与深度，于此可见一斑。蒋匪当局此次拟定“中美农业技术合作计划方案”后，此种情形势将变本加厉。
