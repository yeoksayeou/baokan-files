[News from Shexian from this newspaper] The First District held a production director meeting on October 6th to study the technical guidance for autumn harvest, wheat planting, and seed selection. According to everyone's feedback, due to continuous autumn rains in recent days, the masses are very worried about the autumn harvest rotting and not being able to plant wheat. The production director of Henan Dian said during the discussion: "If we are afraid of the harvest rotting, we can tell the crops to grow and sow the wheat in between, and clean it up when the weather clears." Later, the production director of Kuanzhang said: "Our village, when it was raining, the masses calculated that if they didn't hurry, they wouldn't be able to plant before the frost, so the masses were busy. The Third Detachment (Third Technical Team) was still sowing in the field yesterday while it was raining, sowing 9.4 mu in half a day, using straw hats to cover the seed drill." Zhuang Shang proposed: "The crops have been harvested from the paddy fields, and if it rains again, we can use an 'off-drill' sowing method (specially for very wet land), and dry land can be planted by spot sowing." Yantou proposed: "If it's too wet to cover the spot sowing, you can use a sieve to take some drier soil and put a small handful in each hole. We've used this method before, and it's quite effective." After such discussions, each village decided that for the crops that could not be harvested, they should still focus on inter-sowing, and if the weather clears, quickly plow and sow, and if the weather doesn't clear, follow the above methods and not wait any longer. Regarding preventing the autumn harvest from rotting, everyone initially advocated "Inter-sow the wheat first, and the crops can be harvested later whenever." After discussion, everyone proposed: "No! The crops will drop their seeds when they are ripe, they can’t keep growing in the field, and they will sprout if there is too much rain." In this way, past experiences were recalled, and it was decided that when the rain stops, millet ears could be cut from the field and spread on the ground to dry. If it is too wet, it can be placed on a heated kang. Sorghum can be threshed wet and the seeds dried. Corn can be husked, tied up, and wrapped around pillars. Soybeans will have to wait a few more days, not much was planted this year, it can be taken home. After this study, it was decided to go back and introduce this method, and create better methods among the masses. (Zhi Sheng)

[News from Lincheng from this newspaper] After the County Committee proposed the task of planting all the paddy fields and one-third of the dry land with wheat, each district and village challenged each other and made plans for the autumn harvest and wheat planting. Under the leadership of heroic cadres, an autumn harvest and wheat planting campaign was launched. Under the leadership of the political director Li Eryin of the First District Dongguan, they cultivated land and planted wheat during the day and delivered manure at night, and proposed to compare, to see, and not to sleep until the moon was down. On the evening of the ninth day of the lunar month, militiamen and members of farmers' associations carried 140 loads of manure for military families and cultivated 3 mu of land. The next night, under the leadership of the chairman of the farmers' association, 27 people carried 170 loads of manure to the Dagui Kiln four miles east of the village and cultivated 5 mu of land. From the sixth to the eleventh day of the lunar month, they completed the planting of 650 mu of wheat in six days. Qicun organized a women's autumn harvest team, responsible for cutting crops, freeing up male labor to plant wheat; the militia organized a night battle team to carry manure to the fields and grain to their homes at night; those with good farming techniques organized a land cultivation team, which only managed land cultivation and wheat planting, cultivating 724 mu and planting 381 mu in three days. Jiaonigou and Shigenyou teams in the Second District have now completed the planting of 130 mu for the entire team, with only 27 mu unplanted. Currently, in the entire Lincheng County, according to the situation in only three villages in the First District (Dongguan, Dongjie, Qicun), the Xiji Dian in the Second District, and most of the Third District, all have been mobilized, and a warm wheat planting movement has been formed. Statistics show that 32,941 mu of wheat have been planted. (Zhen Wen)

[News from Xingtai from this newspaper] The Sixth District of Xingtai held a conference of cadres from all base points in the district to study wheat planting. Some believed that in the past, there was little experience in spot sowing of millet, the millet grew tall, and they were afraid of damaging the millet. Some said: "The wheat land is still not compact after plowing it twice, spot sowing of millet is even worse." Some said: "This year's spot sowing of wheat is compact, mainly because the soil is loose and the millet roots are small. After planting, cut the millet and use a hoe to level the stubble, and it will be the same as plowing it once. If you are afraid of grinding the millet, we can have children use long poles to hold the millet down and then sow, so it won't grind." After such discussions, everyone unanimously decided to go back and immediately mobilize the masses to plant by spot sowing. Villages such as Xizhangma harvest crops at night and plant by spot sowing during the day, planting 35 mu of wheat in one day on the 3rd. Women in Dongyangwo Village cut millet, men carry millet at night, and cultivate and plant during the day. Xiqingshan plows the land at night, and Wen Nuanhe Li Chunhui (military family) digs the land at night. A hot and enthusiastic movement has been formed throughout the district.

　　宽漳雨中串种东关深夜送粪
  　各地紧张抢收抢种
    【本报涉县讯】一区于十月六日召开生产主任会，研究秋收种麦选种的技术指导，根据大家反映，近日因秋雨连绵，群众非常耽心烂秋和种不上麦子，研究中河南店生产主任说：“收回怕烂，可以叫庄稼长着把麦子串上，天晴了再收拾。”后宽漳生产主任说：“我村在下雨时群众计算了一下，如果抓不紧霜降也种不上，这样群众着了忙，三分队（第三技工队）昨天下着雨还在地串，半天串了九亩四，用草帽盖着耧斗。”庄上提出：“水地都收了庄稼，再要下雨可用离耧种（专供很湿地用的），旱地可以点种。”沿头提出：“点种太湿不好盖时，可用箩头拿些较干土，每窑少放一把就行，这法我们用过，出来还很肥。”经这样的圪扯后，各村决定回去不能收的庄稼还是以串种为主，天开了就赶紧犁种，天不开就照以上办法种，决不能再等了。在不烂秋方面，开始都主张“先串麦庄稼随后啥时也能收。”经研究后，大家提出：“不行！庄稼熟了就要落籽，不能一直在地长，雨太多了长着也要生芽。”这样又回忆了过去的经验，才决定谷子天一住雨可到地切穗，担回去亮在地上，如果太湿了，可放烧火炕上，黍子割回来可以湿捶下籽来亮籽，玉茭带皮撇回来结起来缠在柱上，豆子还待几天，今年种的不多，割回来拿家也行。这样研究后，决定回去一面介绍这个办法，另外再到群众中创造些更好的办法。（志胜）
    【本报临城讯】在县委会提出水地全部旱地三分之一种麦的任务后，各区、村互相挑战订出了秋收种麦计划，在英雄干部的带头领导下，开展了秋收种麦运动。一区东关在政治主任李二印的领导下，白天耕地种麦，夜间送粪，并提出了比一比、看一看，月不落不睡觉。阴历初九日晚，民兵农会员给军属担粪一百四十担，耕地三亩，第二天晚上，在农会长的带领下，二十七人往村东四里地远的大灰窑，担粪一百七十担，耕地五亩，旧历初六至十一日六天中，即完成种麦六百五十亩。祁村组织了妇女秋收队，专管割庄稼，腾出男劳力种麦；民兵组织了夜战队，黑夜往地里担粪，往家担谷子；耕种技术好的，组织了耕地队，光管耕地种麦，在三天内即耕地七百二十四亩，种麦三百八十一亩。二区胶泥沟、石根友组现已完成全组下种一百三十亩，只剩二十七亩没有种上。现全临城县，仅据一区三个村（东关、东街、祁村）、二区西基点、三区大部的情况，都动员起来，现已形成热烈的种麦运动；统计已种麦三万二千九百四十一亩。

    【本报邢台讯】邢台六区召开全区各基点干部大会，研究种麦，有些认为过去谷地点种经验少，谷子长的高，又怕磨坏谷子。有的说：种麦地耕两遍还不沾，谷子地点种更不行。有的说：今年点种麦子沾，主要是今年地虚谷子根小，种后割了谷子，再用锄把茬榜了，就和耕一遍一样；如怕磨谷子，咱叫儿童用长杆子把谷按住再点，这样不磨。经这样研究，大家一致决定回去马上动员群众点种。西张马等村，晚上收庄稼白天点种，在三号一天内即点种麦子三十五亩，东羊卧村妇女割谷子，男人晚上担谷子，白天耕种，西青山晚上耕地，温暖河李春会（军属）晚上刨地，全区已形成热火朝天的运动。
