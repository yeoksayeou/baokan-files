Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 29th: General He Long, Commander of the Northwest Allied Defense Forces, granted an audience to Liao Ang, Lieutenant General and Commander of the 76th Division of the Chiang army, who had laid down his arms in the Qingjian battle. During the meeting, Liao stood with his hands at his sides, bowing and appearing uneasy. General He Long shook hands with him. When discussing the reasons for the failure of this operation, Liao sighed, "It was due to strategic errors. The commander (referring to Hu Zongnan) was incompetent in commanding, and he went deep into the enemy's territory alone. He made a fatal move and set up a posture of being beaten." He also said, "In the past ten years, our (referring to the Chiang side) army has not made any progress, but has become more and more corrupt and degenerate. This time, when defending Qingjian, I, a division commander, couldn't even command a battalion commander." General He Long immediately pointed out: "That is not simply a strategic error. War is the continuation of politics; Chiang Kai-shek's fundamentally erroneous anti-people political strategy, how can the strategy be correct? The soldiers were all captured and tied up, who would be willing to sell their lives for the four big families? Besides, your Commander Hu is just a slave of Chiang Kai-shek. Under Hu Zongnan's manipulation, he has no authority within his power and no freedom." Liao lowered his head, looked at the tips of his shoes, rubbed his hands, and repeatedly said: "Yes, yes, Commander He's words are very profound." The topic turned to the achievements of the People's Liberation Army's strategy and tactics, Liao gradually returned to normal, and stated his feelings: "First, the number of your army's soldiers has increased, and the soldiers we (referring to the Chiang army, same below) trained have been supplemented to your army; second, your army's weapons are better. The weapons we equipped have equipped your army; third, your army is not only good at mobile warfare, but also better at offensive battles and positional warfare. In a word, your army is growing stronger every day." General He affirmed: "The battle of Shanchengpu ended the first civil war (Note: In December of the 25th year of the Republic of China, Liao Ang led the 232nd Brigade to pursue the Red Army going north to resist Japan, and was completely annihilated by General He Long in Huanchi County, Longdong, Liao Ang escaped with his life. Soon after the Xi'an Incident, the KMT and the Communist Party ceased fighting). Soon there will be a second Shanchengpu, and Chiang Kai-shek will be completely eliminated, ending the second and last civil war." Liao said with emotion: "I never thought that in the era of the Northern Expedition, we went to revolutionize the warlords vigorously, and now the people are vigorously revolutionizing us (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang)." General He Long said sternly: "The main reason is that Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the people and sold out national sovereignty and national interests, which is even worse than the reactionary warlord Yuan Shikai. He is swallowing the evil consequences he cultivated. When you arrive in the liberated area, please rest assured that your life will be absolutely guaranteed. Go to the rear to study for a period of time, and it is up to you to decide whether to work or go home." Liao frequently said yes and bowed to bid farewell.

　　贺龙将军告诫廖昂
  　蒋介石的失败是由于反人民
    【新华社西北二十九日电】西北联防军司令员贺龙将军赐见清涧战斗放下武器的蒋军七六师中将师长廖昂，会面时廖垂手鞠躬，局促不安。贺龙将军与之握手。谈到这次作战的失败原因，廖叹息：“是由于战略错误，长官（指胡宗南）指挥无能，孤军深入，下了一着死棋，摆开了挨打架式”。并谓：“十年来，我们（指蒋方）的军队没有一点长进，反而一天天腐化堕落。这次守清涧，我一个师长连一个营长也指挥不动”，贺龙将军当即指出：“那不是单纯战略错误，战争是政治的继续；蒋介石反人民的政略根本错误，战略怎么会正确？士兵都是抓来绑来的，谁愿意为四大家族卖命？再说你们胡主官的不过是蒋介石的奴隶，在胡宗南的操纵下，没有职权以内的权能和自由”。廖俯首望着鞋尖，搓动双手，连称：“是的，是的，贺司令说得很深刻”。话题转入解放军战略战术的成果，廖逐渐恢复常态，申述其观感：“第一，贵军战士多了，我们（指蒋军，下同）训练的士兵补充了贵军；第二，贵军武器好了。我们配备的武器装备了贵军；第三，贵军不但善于运动战，而且更善于攻坚战阵地战。一句话，贵军是一天天发展壮大了。”贺将军肯定地说：“山城堡一战结束了第一次内战（按：民国二十五年十二月廖昂率二三二旅追击北上抗日红军，被贺龙将军全歼于陇东环县山城堡，廖昂仅以身免。不久双十二事变，国共停战）。不久将会有第二次山城堡到来，就要彻底消灭蒋介石，结束第二次也是最后一次内战”。廖不胜感慨地说：“想不到在北伐时代轰轰烈烈去革军阀的命，现在人民又轰轰烈烈的来革我们（指蒋家匪帮）的命了”。贺龙将军义正词严的说：“主要的还是蒋介石背叛了人民，出卖了国家主权、民族利益，比反动军阀袁世凯更有过之，自己吞食自己所培植的恶果。到了解放区，请放心，生命是得到绝对的安全保障。到后方去学习一个时期，工作或回家由你自愿”。廖频称是，鞠躬告退。
