　　Ronghe Cadres' Self-Criticism on Taking the Poor and Hired Peasant Line
　　Zhao Long
　　[This Dispatch from Taiyue, 20th] During the second cadre expansion meeting in Ronghe, all cadres recognized that the line of relying on poor and hired peasants is the class line in the land reform movement. The unity of poor and hired peasant backbones with middle peasants is the fundamental key to thoroughly eliminating feudalism and realizing land to the tillers. From the work before the autumn harvest, it was deeply felt that land reform went well in villages that relied on poor and hired peasants; otherwise, it was stagnant and full of difficulties. Dongsiya Village relied on poor and hired peasants and reformed the leadership, giving the movement new development. Shashi and Fan Villages relied on poor and hired peasants and quickly launched spontaneous struggles in all base villages. Rongzhang Village relied on poor and hired peasants and avoided clan struggles. In short, each district has vivid facts proving the importance of relying on poor and hired peasants. During the meeting, everyone also examined their thoughts on taking the line of relying on poor and hired peasants in the work before the autumn harvest: (1) Standing on the middle peasant's position to mobilize poor and hired peasants, believing that middle peasants would speak up, that it was easy to mobilize them, and that one could mobilize three middle peasants in a day, but not one poor or hired peasant in three days, so they used middle peasants to struggle and "resolve" the problems of poor and hired peasants. (2) Despising poor and hired peasants and being detached from them. When visiting their homes, they found them too dirty and had no place to sit, and the food was not good. In short, they disliked poor and hired peasants for being unclean and could not approach them. (3) Not believing that poor and hired peasants were capable. Asking them a question was like asking a blank wall, how could they be village chiefs or chairmen to lead everyone? Secondly, using the excuse that there were few poor and hired peasants, and that they were old or young, to cover up the idea of ​​underestimating the poor and hired peasant class. These are all the evils of the landlord ruling class's thoughts. (4) Some places relied on active poor and hired peasant activists to carry out work, but were only satisfied with this point, and did not mobilize the ordinary poor and hired peasants. As a result, they lost a large number of loyal and reliable basic masses, and gradually unconsciously stood on the side of the middle peasants, acting according to the opinions of the middle peasants.

　　In addition, the meeting also discovered and summarized some experiences in mobilizing poor and hired peasants in the previous period of work: (1) Finding poor and hired peasants in the village, going to ancestral halls, temples, and dilapidated courtyards to find sufferers. After finding a sufferer, they would connect with other sufferers, uniting all the sufferers. Then, they would convene a meeting of poor and hired peasants to pour out their grievances. In short, once the thinking is clear, there are naturally many methods. (2) Mobilizing poor and hired peasants to pour out their grievances and dig out the roots of poverty. In the past, Jincheng had a slogan: "If you don't thoroughly pour out your grievances, you won't be able to turn over." This is a very good experience. In the previous period of work in the Second District, the district took a detour because it did not universally encourage speaking bitterness. Other districts and villages carried out speaking bitterness, but it was still limited to speaking about the bitterness of the targets and simple suffering, not yet deeply and universally, and had not yet grasped the main method of mobilizing poor and hired peasants. Therefore, to take the line of relying on poor and hired peasants, it is necessary to mobilize poor and hired peasants to pour out their grievances and dig out the roots of poverty, so as to raise their class consciousness, promote their intelligence and wisdom, and lead everyone to thoroughly eliminate feudalism. (3) Cultivate leading cadres from among the poor and hired peasants. The leadership power in land reform must be handed over to the poor and hired peasants. (4) Establish separate organizations for poor and hired peasants within the peasant association to ensure the leading role of poor and hired peasants and establish the prestige of poor and hired peasants.

　　荣河干部走贫雇路线的思想检查
    赵龙
    【本报太岳廿日电】荣河在第二次扩干会议中，全体干部已认识了雇贫路线便是土改运动中的阶级路线，贫雇骨干团结中农，是彻底消灭封建实现耕者有其田的基本关键，从秋前的一段工作中，已深切的感觉到凡是依靠雇贫的村子，土地改革就搞的好，否则，便是沉寂与困难重重。东思雅村依靠了雇贫，改造了领导，使运动有了新发展。沙石、范村依靠了雇贫，很快的开展了全基点村的自发斗争。荣张村依靠了雇贫，避免了宗派斗争。总之，各区皆有活的事实，证明依靠雇贫的重要。会议中，大家也对秋前一段工作中走雇贫路线的思想作了检查：（一）站在中农立场上去发动雇贫，认为中农会说，发动容易，一天能发动起三个中农，而三天却发动不起一个雇贫农，所以便利用中农斗争，“解决”雇贫问题。（二）鄙视雇贫，脱离雇贫，到了他们家里，嫌太脏，没有坐的地方，吃的饭又不好。总之，嫌雇贫不干净，不能接近。（三）不相信雇贫农能干。一问三不知，还能当村长、主席来领导大家？其次，借口雇贫人数少，并且还是老的老，小的小，以掩护轻视雇贫阶级的思想。这都是地主统治阶级的思想作祟。（四）有些地方依靠了雇贫积极分子进行工作，但仅满足于此点，而未将雇贫层普通的发动起来。因此，失掉了大批忠实可靠的基本群众，又逐渐不自觉的站到中农方面去，根据中农的意见作。
    另外也发现与总结前一段工作中发动雇贫的点滴经验：（一）找寻雇贫到村里走向祠堂庙室破院中去找苦人，发现一个苦人，再以苦人联络苦人，就团结起全体苦人来，接着召开雇贫诉苦会。总之，思想明确了，方法也自然很多。（二）发动雇贫诉苦挖穷根。过去晋城有个口号：“诉不透苦、翻不透身”这是很好的经验。二区前一段工作未经普遍的诉苦，走了弯路，其它区村进行了诉苦，但还限于诉对象苦，简单的熬煎苦，还未深入普遍，还没有把握发动雇贫的主要方法。因此，走雇贫路线，必须发动雇贫诉苦，挖穷根，才能提高其阶级觉悟，发扬其聪明智慧，领导大家彻底消灭封建。（三）培养雇贫领导干。土改中的领导大权，一定要交给雇贫。（四）在农会中建立雇贫的单独组织，以保证雇贫领导作用，树立雇贫。（太岳分社）
