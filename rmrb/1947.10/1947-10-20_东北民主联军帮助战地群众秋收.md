　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 17th: The Northeast Democratic Allied Army is universally helping the masses near the war zone with the autumn harvest during lulls in the fighting. Since our army swept across the south bank of the Liao River and liberated large areas of land, the season has turned cold, and frost has fallen several times, but autumn crops still remain in the fields. Our troops are both ready for battle and universally engaged in assisting with the harvest in the war zone. Heroes who were bravely killing the enemy on the battlefield not long ago are now actively wielding knives in the fields to cut grain. The commander and political commissar of the unit also took time out from their busy military affairs to go to the fields and harvest alongside the soldiers. In just over a day, the directly subordinate units of the division helped the masses harvest more than 200 hectares, and also helped the masses bundle the crops and transport them to the threshing ground by cart. After the assistance with the harvest and the propaganda work were combined, the rumors spread by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents to frighten the masses have been completely shattered. Now, men and women are working together, and the people and the military are on excellent terms. At present, the villages have gradually returned to normal and are entering into a heated rush harvest campaign.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jidong, 16th: After continuously carrying out struggles to protect the fields from Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and overcoming water and hail disasters, the farmers of Jidong are now happily celebrating their first autumn harvest since their liberation. Soldiers at the front are also assisting the people in harvesting during intense fighting. Xianghe, Wuqing, Tongxian and other places have had bumper harvests, which are rare in nearly a hundred years. Rainfall was consistent on both banks of the Bei Canal, and within a radius of eighty li, the sorghum stalks are as high as nine chi, and the ears are one chi to one chi two or three cun long. The best of the thousand qing of fertile land on both banks of the Tongxian Canal can yield three dan and five dou of grain per mu (150 jin per dan). Baodi and Ninghe have suffered from flooding nine years out of ten, but this year they have an average harvest of 70%. Although the triangular area of Ping, Jin, and Tong has repeatedly suffered from Chiang Kai-shek's armed forces forcibly cutting green seedlings, as well as hail and floods, the average harvest this year has reached 90% due to the arduous struggle of the army and people throughout the region. Armed protection of the autumn harvest is being universally carried out in the border areas. On the 17th of last month, a regiment of the enemy from Chengde invaded Xiabancheng, an important station on the Jin-Cheng Railway, but was defeated by us, and its landlord armed deputy battalion commander, Cheng Linping, was killed. Chiang Kai-shek's bandits who invaded the Changli and Lening areas to loot grain were also annihilated by us, with more than 320 people killed. Nearly two companies of Chiang Kai-shek's Fifth and Sixth Divisions' grain looting troops were also annihilated in Nandaxinzhuang, Fengrun. Xianghe has launched a landmine offensive during the autumn harvest to strictly block the enemy. From the 20th of last month to the 10th of this month, the county has reaped 180,000 mu under armed protection. In the Yutian and Sanhe areas, twenty-four autumn protection battles were carried out this month, killing and capturing more than 600 Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Soldiers at the front, despite being engaged in intense fighting, also took the opportunity to actively help the masses with the autumn harvest. The directly subordinate units of the Fifteenth Military Subdistrict alone helped harvest more than 3,000 mu in five days. The liberated farmers in various places have unanimously put forward the slogan "Fight well for the autumn grain and send it to the front as soon as possible."
