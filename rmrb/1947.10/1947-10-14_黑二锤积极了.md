Black Second Hammer is a hired poor peasant from Lizhuang, Yongnian Third District, over forty years old, and very capable in farm work, having suffered a lifetime of hardship. In farm work, he is most skilled at hoeing, hoeing in one day what an ordinary person can hoe in two days. Therefore, the landlords of the past very much wanted to hire him, and in order to get him, they would sometimes even lend him livestock.

In the autumn of 1945, the farmers' association was established, and Black Second Hammer joined. He initially showed enthusiasm for fighting the landlords, but gradually became passive. This June, Black Second Hammer participated in a peasant training class. While others showed great enthusiasm for turning the tables, Black Second Hammer alone was emotionally low, and said in front of everyone: "There are no landlords in our village, so there's no need to fight." He also said: "If we fight the landlords, my rice bowl will be kicked away. Even if I want to do work, no one will hire me. Even if I want to borrow livestock, there's nowhere to borrow it from." Everyone explained many reasons to him, but it didn't move him at all. Some became discouraged, blaming each other: "Why did we call him to be trained? He can't accomplish anything and will only mess things up." So some estimated: "He has been doing good work his whole life, and he is very popular with the landlords. He doesn't want to fight the landlords, he must be a mole!" Thus, they became suspicious of him. Other peasants in Lizhuang severely reprimanded and threatened him: "If news is leaked this time, you will be responsible. If the poor can't turn the tables, you will be responsible." Black Second Hammer became somewhat anxious, angrily saying: "The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army have been calling for the poor to turn the tables for several years, why haven't the poor turned the tables yet? I am not responsible." Everyone was disappointed in him.

After the training class ended, the district cadre responsible for leading the work in his village had a knot in his heart! "Black Second Hammer is a poor peasant, why isn't he enthusiastic?" One night, he had a detailed conversation with Black Second Hammer, asking him: "You are a poor person, why don't you want to turn the tables?" "I can't live without the landlords." "Can't you live after fighting the landlords and dividing the land?" Black Second Hammer suspiciously asked: "After dividing the land, who will give us the land?" The district cadre said: "This struggle is different from the past. We will guarantee that the fruits are distributed to the poor farmers." Black Second Hammer disbelievingly said: "Even if we fight, we won't get anything." The district cadre firmly told him: "As long as you are a poor farmer, you can get a share. If you don't get a share, come to me. If you get less than your share, I will not ignore you." Only then did Black Second Hammer's heart stir, and he said: "To tell you the truth, the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army came and called for us to turn the tables, but actually we were harmed. Last year, we fought for more than half a year, wasting so much time, and only got a peck of wheat. The village cadres ate more than twenty watermelons, without paying for them. When confiscating the landlord's things, if we were slow, we would be scolded by the village cadres. The things we fought for, we poor people couldn't even touch." The district cadre asked: "What did you fight for in the past?" Black Second Hammer became somewhat resentful, saying: "Everyone wanted to fight, but the village cadres drank the landlords' wine. The two landlord families only voluntarily gave fifteen stone of sorghum. The village cadres divided it up, one stone at a time, two stones at a time. The money from selling the trees in the temple was spent by two or three village cadres. Later, we fought again, holding meetings continuously, and after more than two months, we fought for less than twenty stone of grain. When it came time to distribute the grain, each of our twenty-plus poor families only got a dipper of sorghum. Do you think that's infuriating! But we fought for twenty mu of bad land, and they insisted that the poor people plant it. No one wanted to plant it, and no one dared to say anything. If anyone said they didn't want to plant it, the village cadres would say they were 'afraid of death and had reactionary thoughts.' Everyone had to swallow their anger and plant the bad land. Speaking of it, there were so many tricks in the village in the past." After listening to Black Second Hammer's words, the district cadre realized that Black Second Hammer didn't not want to turn the tables. So, he became even more interested in talking: "Why didn't you tell the district cadres about these opinions earlier?" Black Second Hammer straightforwardly said: "I was afraid that the district cadres would be in cahoots with the bad village cadres and wouldn't stand up for the poor people." Hearing this criticism, the district cadre solemnly said: "This year will be completely different from previous years. We will definitely support the poor people, so be bold and do it! We won't let your village's former village chief and director continue to do their jobs." At this point, Black Second Hammer became excited and happy, and continued: "If you really want the poor farmers to turn the tables, and the things can be distributed to the poor, then the poor people won't want to be bossed around by the landlords!" Later, during the struggle, Black Second Hammer completely brought up his opinions about the bad village cadres in the meeting. Under the strength of the masses, the bad village cadres also lowered their heads. From then on, Black Second Hammer became a very good activist, fighting very bravely, speaking very correctly, and being serious and responsible for everything. Everyone elected him as the custodian, responsible for keeping the undistributed fruits of the struggle. Under his custody, no one, regardless of who they were, could touch a needle or thread of the fruits of the struggle, and he was highly praised by everyone. Soon after, he was elected as the village farmers' association minister. Now, his eldest child has also joined the militia and is working even harder. (Jinan Branch)

　　黑二锤积极了
    黑二锤是个雇贫农，永年三区李庄人，四十多岁了，很能做庄稼活，受了一辈子苦。在庄稼活上，他锄地最拿手，一天锄的，能顶平常人两天锄的。因此，过去的地主很想找他做活，并为了再觅他，有时还借给他牲口用。
    四五年秋季成立农会，黑二锤参加了，开始对地主斗争还有劲，但慢慢消极起来了。今年六月，黑二锤参加了农民训练班，别人翻身的劲头很大，独有黑二锤情绪低，并当着大家说：“俺村没有地主，不用斗了。”又说：“斗了地主，就把我的饭碗子踢了，想做活也没人觅了，想借个牲口也没处借了。”大家给他讲了好多道理，没打动他一点，有些泄气了，互相埋怨着：“为什么叫他来受训？不能成事还要坏事哩。”于是有人估计：“他一辈子做好活，在地主跟前很吃香，他不愿意叫斗地主，一定是走里分子！”这样就对他怀疑起来。李庄别的农民就向他进行了严厉的责备与威胁：“这回斗争走漏了消息，你要负责任，穷人翻不了身你要负责任。”黑二锤有些发急了，气愤的说：“共产党八路军叫穷人翻身，过来几年了，穷人怎么还没翻身？我才不负责哩。”大家都对他失望了。
    训练班结束了，负责领导他村工作的区干，心上结了个疙瘩！“黑二锤是贫农，为啥不起劲呢？”一天晚上，与黑二锤详细交谈，问他：“你是穷人，到底为啥不愿意翻身？”“我离了地主过不了。”“斗了地主分了地还过不了吗？”黑二锤怀疑的问：“分了地，谁分给地？”区干说：“咱这次斗争和过去不同，果实要保证分到穷苦农民手里。”黑二锤不相信的说：“斗争了也分不了啥。”区干肯定的告诉他：“只要是贫苦农民就能分，你分不了果实，冲着我来说，你分的少了我也不见你。”黑二锤这才心里活动说了话：“实话告你说吧，共产党八路军过来叫翻身，实际上俺被了伤了。去年斗争了多半年，耽误了多少工夫，只分了一斗麦子，村干部吃了二十多个西瓜，没给钱。没收地主东西时，一时慢了，还得挨村干的骂，斗争了的东西，咱们穷人都摸不着分。”区干问：“过去都斗了些啥？”黑二锤有些愤恨了，说：“大家要斗争，村干喝了地主的酒，两家地主只自动了十五石高粱，村干一石的一石，两石的两石的分了。庙上的树卖的钱，两三个村干花了。后来又斗争，一连不断的开会，两个多月又斗出不到二十石粮食，到分粮时，俺二十多家贫农，每人只分了斗把高粱。你看气人不气人！但斗出二十亩坏地，硬要给穷人种，大家都不愿种，谁也不敢吭，如谁说不种，村干就说谁：“怕死，有变天思想。”大家只有忍气种了坏地。说起来，过去村中一桩一桩的鬼道多呢。”区干听了黑二锤这一番话，才知道黑二锤不是不愿翻身。于是谈的兴趣就更高了：“你这些意见，早先为什么不给区干说呢？”黑二锤很直爽的说道：“怕区干和坏村干一劲，不给穷人做主。”区干听到这个批评，用严肃态度表示说：“今年与往年绝不相同，我们一定给穷人撑腰，你大胆干吧！你村去年的村长、主任都不让他们干了。”谈到这里，黑二锤兴奋愉快起来，接着说：“要真正叫穷苦农民翻身，东西能分到穷人手里，穷人还有愿意受地主的气哩！”后来斗争时，黑二锤在会议上把对过去坏村干的意见完全提出来了，在群众力量下，坏村干也低了头。从此，黑二锤就变成很好的积极分子了，斗争很勇敢，说理很正确，对于一切事情都认真负责，大家就选他当保管员，负责保管未分去的斗争果实。在他保管下，不论任何人，对斗争果实一针一线也不能动，很受大家称赞。不久，又被选为村农会部长。现在，他的大孩子也参加了民兵，干的劲头更大。（冀南分社）
