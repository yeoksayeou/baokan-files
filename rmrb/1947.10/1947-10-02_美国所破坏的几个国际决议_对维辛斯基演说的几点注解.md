The United States' Violation of Several International Resolutions
    —Some Notes on Vyshinsky's Speech

    Recently, Vyshinsky, the head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations, delivered a speech denouncing the American reactionaries for instigating war, failing to make peaceful efforts in accordance with resolutions decided upon at previous international conferences, creating terror everywhere, actually preparing for war, and making baseless accusations against the Soviet Union. If we examine the international resolutions and the provisions of the UN Charter, which the United States also participated in and signed, mentioned in Vyshinsky's speech, we can better understand how the United States disregards good faith and undermines peace.

    (1) In the second paragraph of Vyshinsky's speech, "The US and Britain Oppose Disarmament," the reference to "the UN General Assembly's decision on universal disarmament on December 14, 1946" refers to the following resolutions passed by the UN General Assembly at the time: 1. The General Assembly recognizes the necessity of a general resolution on the reduction of armaments and military forces; 2. The General Assembly recommends to the Security Council that it immediately decide on various plans and measures to achieve the goals of adjusting and reducing armaments (including the control of atomic energy); 3. The Assembly recommends that the Security Council draft one or more treaties providing for the prohibition and elimination of atomic energy for military purposes, and the establishment of an international control and supervision system for atomic energy for peaceful purposes, to ensure that member states complying with the treaty are not threatened by violators; 4. The General Assembly instructs member states to gradually withdraw their troops stationed abroad. The above four points were passed amidst cheers from UN member states at the time. However, what the United States has done in the past six months is a series of heinous actions that violate the above four resolutions. This can be most clearly judged by our experience of American imperialist aggression and the continued presence of American troops in China. In addition, the activities of American troops around the world can be seen almost daily, and American officials are vigorously promoting war and expanding and training troops, all of which are actions that violate the decision on universal disarmament.

    (2) In the third paragraph of Vyshinsky's speech, "The United States Opposes the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons," it is mentioned that "the Atomic Energy Commission has been working for a year and a half, but none of the tasks stipulated in the UN General Assembly resolution of January 24, 1946, have been completed, and there has been no progress in implementing this resolution." What did this resolution stipulate? This was the agreement reached by the three foreign ministers in Moscow at the end of December 1945, and then submitted to the UN General Assembly in January 1946 for approval. The important points were: The resolution established a committee. A. The committee must submit its reports and recommendations to the Security Council, unless the Security Council, in the interests of peace and security, keeps them secret, in which case it may forward these reports to the United Nations Organization, the General Assembly, other member states of the United Nations, and the Economic and Social Council. B. According to the UN Charter, the Security Council's primary responsibility is to maintain international peace and security, so the Security Council should issue various instructions on security issues to the committee. The committee may report its work to the Security Council on these issues. Regarding the committee's powers: 1. Expanding the international exchange of basic scientific information for peaceful purposes; 2. The committee must control atomic energy to ensure that it is only used for peaceful purposes; 3. Eliminating atomic weapons from national armaments and abolishing the use of other weapons of mass destruction; 4. Through investigation and other methods, effectively ensuring that countries are not threatened by the atomic weapons and other secret weapons of treaty violators; 5. The committee's work should be carried out in stages, and the successful completion of each stage will generate confidence in the world before proceeding to the second stage... However, this resolution, as Vyshinsky said, has been in effect for a year and a half, but because the United States is attempting to monopolize atomic weapons, this extremely important committee for maintaining world peace has accomplished nothing.

    (3) What are the inconsistencies mentioned in Vyshinsky's speech in the section "Inconsistencies between the Trusteeship Agreements and the Charter"? Originally, the trusteeship system was a major effort in this war to correct the shortcomings of the mandate system. The Soviet Union and other countries proposed to the United Nations that the colonies of Germany, Japan, and Italy, as well as the former mandated territories, be managed by the UN Trusteeship Council to prevent the intrusion of another imperialism and to gradually enable these colonies to achieve self-government. This trusteeship system is a reasonable system that enables colonies to truly achieve independence and freedom. However, the United States wants to place the former Japanese mandated islands currently occupied by the US military under its own trusteeship and says unreasonably, "If the US trusteeship proposal is opposed, the United States will maintain its rule over the islands." In addition, the Charter stipulates that one of the main types of UN trusteeship is the former League of Nations mandated territories, involving eight countries, namely Britain, France, Belgium, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and the United States. The Charter stipulates that the trusteeship of territories must be realized after direct consultations and the conclusion of a sufficient number of trusteeship agreements by the countries directly concerned; if this procedure cannot be completed, the Trusteeship Council cannot be established. However, the trustee countries (US, Britain, etc.) are obstructing the work of the Trusteeship Council, demanding to establish military bases in the trustee territories without the approval of the Security Council, and strongly opposing the creation of any mandatory decisions to amend their "trusteeship agreements." At the UN General Assembly on December 13, 1946, the Soviet representative criticized this colonial policy as being contrary to the provisions of the UN Charter (to grant independence and freedom to the people of the trust territories) and was supported by South, India, Iraq and other countries, but because the United States and other countries manipulated the vote, the "trusteeship agreement" that oppresses the people of the colonies was passed.

　　美国所破坏的几个国际决议
    ——对维辛斯基演说的几点注解
    最近联合国苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发表演说，斥责美国反动派挑拨战争，不依照历次国际会议所商决的议案作和平的努力，反而到处制造恐怖，实际准备战争，并对苏联发出毫无根据的狂吠。若把维氏演说中所指美国也曾参与并且签字的历次国际决议及联合国宪章的规定提出来研究一番，将更可使我们了解美国是如何的不顾信义破坏和平。
    （一）在维氏演说第二段“美英反对裁军”中，其所指“一九四六年十二月十四日联合国大会实施普遍裁军决定”一点，在当时联大的决议案是：一、联大承认裁减军队与军备一般决议案之必要性；二、联大向安全理事会建议立即决定各项计划及措施，以调整及裁减军备（包括原子能管制在内）之目标得以实现；三、大会建议安理会草拟一种及多种条约，规定禁止及取消原子能作为作战用途，以及为和平用途之原子能创立国际管制及监督制度，保障遵守条约之会员国不受违反条约者之威胁；四、联大责成各会员国逐渐撤退其国外驻军。以上四点，当时在联合国会员国齐声欢呼中通过。但是，美国半年来所做的却正是违反以上四项决议的一连串罪恶行动。这由我们身受美帝国主义侵略及美军仍驻军中国等事就可作最明确的判断。此外，几乎每日都可见到美军在世界各地的活动，美官方并大加鼓吹战争及扩军练军，都是违反普遍裁军决定的行动。
    （二）在维氏演说第三段“美国反对禁止原子武器”中说到：“原子能委员会工作已达一年半，但一九四六年一月二十四日联合国大会决议中所规定的任务，没有一件完成，而且在执行这一决议中毫无进展。”这一个决议规定了什么？这就是在一九四五年十二月底三外长在莫斯科所得协议，然后提交一九四六年一月联合国大会所通过的议案，其重要的是：决议设立一委员会。Ａ、该委员会须将其报告与建议提交安全理事会，除非安全理事会为了和平及安全之利益保守秘密时，在必要时，得把这些报告转交经联合国组织、全体大会、联合国其他委员国及经济社会问题理事会。Ｂ、根据联合国宪章，安全理事会之主要责任，原为维持国际之和平与安全，故安全理事会应对委员会颁发有关安全问题的各种指示。关于这些问题，委员会得向安全理事会报告自己的工作。关于该委员会的职权：一、扩大国际间交换以和平为目的之基本科学情报；二、委员会须控制原子能，保证了只运用于和平之目的；三、从国家的军备中消除原子武器，取消使用大规模毁灭性的其他武器；四、以调查及其他方法，以便有效保证使各国不受违约国原子武器及其他秘密武器破坏的威胁；五、委员会的工作应分段进行，每一阶段之顺到完成，将引起世人之信仰，然后进行第二阶段……。但是，这个决议，正如维氏所说，已经成立一年半了，但因为美国企图独占原子武器的结果，这个维持世界和平极端重要的委员会竟是一事无成。
    （三）在维氏演词“托管协议与宪章不符之处”一段中所说不符之处是什么呢？原来托管制是这次大战役为纠正委任统治的缺点，苏联等国家向联合国提出：将德、日、意三国的殖民地及过去的委任统治地，由联合国托管委员会负责管理，以禁止另一帝国主义的侵入，而使这些殖民地逐渐获得自治的能力。这种托管制是使殖民地真正获得独立自由的合理制度。但是，美国却要将现由美军占领的前日本委任统治各岛屿置于自己托管之下，并蛮横无理的这样说：“反对美国之托管建议，则美国将保持对各岛的统治权。”比外，宪章中规定，联合国托管之下，主要的一种是前国联的委任统治地，牵涉八个国家，即英、法、比、澳、南非、新西兰和美国等，宪章规定托管领土须由直接有关各国经过谈判并订立充分数目之托管协定后，始能实现；如果这种程序不能完成，则托管理事会便不能成立。而各托管国家（美英等）却阻碍托管委员会的工作，要求在各托管地区建立军事基地，而无须经安全理事会批准，并极力反对制成任何修改他们所订的“托管协议”中的强制性决定。一九四六年十二月十三日联合国大会上苏联代表曾抨击这种殖民地政策与联合国宪章的规定（使托管区人民获得独立自由）相违背，并受南、印、伊拉克等国支持，但因美国等国玩弄票数，压迫殖民地人民的“托管协议”竟被通过。（本报资料室）
