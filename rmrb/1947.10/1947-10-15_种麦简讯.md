    Neiqiu County Party Committee Instructs Guaranteeing Poor and Hired Peasants Plant Wheat
    [Report from this newspaper in Neiqiu] According to the results of the autumn harvest inspection, the Neiqiu County Party Committee specifically instructed cadres in various districts to further recognize the seriousness of the disaster areas, seize the time to plant a large amount of wheat, ensuring that every poor and hired peasant can plant enough wheat. The whole county should reach a wheat field area of one-half of the total land. It is necessary to break the masses' waiting mentality and distrust of the organization's strength, organize a scientific division of labor, overcome difficulties with labor and livestock, and create experiences for timely promotion. It is imperative to pay attention to the practical difficulties of emancipated peasants (especially poor and hired peasants who have not completely turned over) in wheat planting (such as seeds, livestock, fertilizer, etc.), call on emancipated peasants to carry out mutual aid movements, call on and organize village cadres and party members to play a leading role, and loudly propose "Everyone plants more wheat, to overcome the disaster together, and the whole village will not go hungry next spring."

      Wuan Third District Launches Second Wheat Interplanting Movement
    [Report from this newspaper in Wuan] The new district of Wuan Third District had three replantings this year. The first two times were in early July, after which it rained twice, and 70,000 mu of major crops were planted. There were missing seedlings in 30,000 mu. The third time, in some villages at the Shannan base point and the Yehe base point, it rained on July 28th and 29th, planting more than 40,000 mu. Now the first two rounds of major crops are being harvested and autumn plowing is underway. The Shannan minor crops have matured later due to a few cold days, and most have been interplanted with wheat. In order to expand the wheat fields, a second wheat interplanting movement has recently been launched. (Dingguo, Yuchang, Yaoqing, Jianzhong, Sun Jing)
