　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Santiago dispatch: In Chile, 18,000 miners went on strike on the 4th due to demands for wage increases. Although they have suffered large-scale arrests and military suppression from the beginning, they have persisted for eight days, threatening the coal supply for Chilean power plants and railways, and factories are also facing closure. The Chilean government has been forced to implement fuel rationing and use fuel reserves from the military. On the evening of the 8th, Chilean President Videla made a preposterous statement, falsely accusing two Yugoslavian envoys stationed in Chile of "directing the sabotage activities of the Chilean Communist Party" and expelling them from the country, and spreading rumors that "South American Communist Parties are under the command of the Belgrade Communist International and have established centers in Buenos Aires and Rosario." This is to create a pretext for the barbaric suppression of domestic democratic movements, to please American imperialism (U.S. officials publicly praised the Chilean government's actions as "courageous" on the 9th), and to collude with countries such as Argentina and Uruguay to launch anti-people movements. However, Videla's provocation has aroused indignation at home and abroad. The South government announced on the 11th that it was severing diplomatic relations with Chile, and accused it of being directed by foreign forces and adopting a hostile attitude towards the South. The Argentine Communist Party issued a statement on the 10th, expressing indignation and "demanding that evidence be presented." The Chilean Communist Party has requested the United Nations to consider the situation in Chile since the 8th, and has requested that a committee be organized by well-known figures to investigate the truth.

　　智利万八千矿工罢工
  　智总理诬称南国策动
  　南政府宣布与智绝交
    【新华社陕北十五日电】圣地牙哥讯：智利一万八千矿工因要求增资而于四日实行大罢工。虽一开始就遭受政府之大逮捕与军事镇压，但已坚持八日，威胁了智利发电厂与铁路的煤源，工厂亦将关闭。智利政府已被迫实行燃料配给；并动用军队的燃料储备。智总统魏德拉于八日晚竟发表荒诞之声明，诬陷南斯拉夫驻智利使节二人“指导智利共产党的破坏活动”予以驱逐出境，并造谣“南美共产党受贝尔格莱德共产国际之指挥，已在布宜诺斯艾利斯及罗萨利俄两城设立中心。”以此制造野蛮镇压国内民主运动之借口，取悦美帝国主义（美官方人士于九日公开称赞智利政府之行动为“勇敢”）并拉拢阿根廷与乌拉圭等国掀起反人民的运动。但魏氏此种挑拨，已引起国内外之义愤。南政府已于十一日宣布与智利绝交，并指斥其受外国势力的指挥对南采取敌视态度。阿根廷共产党十日发表声明，表示愤慨，并“要求提出证据。”智利共产党要求联合国考虑智利自八日以来之形势，并要求以知名之士组织一委员会，以调查事实真象。
