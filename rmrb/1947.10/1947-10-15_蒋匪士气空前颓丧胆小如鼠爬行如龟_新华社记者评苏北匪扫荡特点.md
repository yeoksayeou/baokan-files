Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 13th—Our correspondent from the Northern Jiangsu Branch commented on the fact that the military and civilians in the Huai’an, Lianshui, and Funing triangle area crushed Chiang’s army's third large-scale "mopping-up" operation in mid-to-late September, stating: This "mopping-up" operation by Chiang's army was a desperate struggle in the face of the People's Liberation Army's large-scale counter-offensive, and its nature was completely different from the first and second "mopping-up" operations in January-February and June of this year. Since the victory of the People's Liberation Army in Yancheng in August, Chiang's troops in Northern Jiangsu have shifted from persistence to a new stage of counter-attack. Chiang's army was extremely shocked by this important strategic area connecting Southern Shandong in the north and bordering the Jinpu Railway in the west. Therefore, it scraped together more than 10,000 people from important defense lines such as the Shuyang-Huaiyin highway to carry out a barbaric "mopping-up" operation on both sides of the silted Yellow River between Huai'an, Lianshui and Funing, in order to hinder the powerful counter-offensive of the People's Liberation Army. However, the area where Chiang's army devoted all its efforts to "mopping-up" only accounted for one-eighth of the entire Northern Jiangsu. The reporter continued: During the second "mopping-up" operation by Chiang's army in June, it still attempted to open the Lianshui-Funing highway and build strongholds in order to occupy it for a long time. However, this time, it roamed around and looted everywhere, and even the important town of Yilin was occupied and evacuated twice, daring not stay for long. Finally, the People's Liberation Army launched a slight attack on the enemy's empty Shuyang-Huaiyin Road, and immediately controlled 80 miles of the road, forcing Chiang's army to turn back for rescue, and the "mopping-up" operation was quickly crushed by us. The reporter also stated: Another characteristic of this "mopping-up" operation was a desperate struggle. Chiang's army's morale was depressed, and its combat effectiveness was at an all-time low. Although it gathered tens of thousands of people, it was still as cowardly as mice and crawled like turtles. It took three days to travel 30 miles from Xuji in eastern Lianshui to Sujiao in Huai'an, and the overnight villages were no more than five miles apart. At the first sound of gunfire, they shrank their turtle heads and dared not move. Chiang's army occupying Donggou lit gasoline lamps high at night, illuminating the surrounding fields to embolden themselves. This "mopping-up" operation by Chiang's army lasted a total of 20 days (September 11th to 30th), which was much shorter than the first "mopping-up" operation of 40 days and the second of 25 days. On the other hand, our military and civilians are full of confidence in victory. While resisting the enemy, they continue to carry out land reform. Three women from Guanjigou captured a soldier of Chiang's army, and other militiamen and unarmed masses captured more than 20 bandits and puppets. The rapid change in the enemy's situation can be seen from this.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 13th—Late news: In Rudong, Taixing, Zishi (new county located north of Rugao) and Haian-Taizhou line's newly recovered Shizhuang District in Central Jiangsu, 20,000 people launched a powerful political offensive against the enemy on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival (September 29th). On that night, torchlight parades were held in the above-mentioned areas, with the parade marching mightily straight to the foot of the Chiang puppet strongholds and bunkers, and slogans resounded through the sky. The enemy at Chedangkou in Rudong was so frightened that they fled to Matang in a panic, and the stronghold was immediately recovered. The enemies in other strongholds were also so frightened that they did not make a sound and hid in the bunkers, daring not to show their heads. When the Taixing parade team reached the Huijiaduo stronghold, the masses angrily surrounded the stronghold and dragged the local tyrant Chen Xianyou to the bunker and executed him on the spot; at this time, the family members of the local Chiang puppets rushed into the stronghold, embracing their relatives and crying bitterly, urging their errant husbands and sons to repent and rehabilitate themselves during the Mid-Autumn Festival and return home for reunion. Many local Chiang's wrote letters asking their families to bring them to the masses, requesting to atone for their crimes, and more than ten people, including Lin Guangran and Tao Huakuan, returned with their weapons. Farmers in Zishi held a mass meeting to preliminarily try the key members of the "Home-Returning Corps" and win over the coerced followers. More than 30 people from the Shizhuang enemy stronghold in Rugao were also won over and returned with their weapons.

　　蒋匪士气空前颓丧胆小如鼠爬行如龟
  　新华社记者评苏北匪扫荡特点
    【新华社华中十三日电】苏北分社记者评述淮（安）涟（水）阜（宁）三角地区军民，于九月中下旬第三次粉碎蒋军之大“扫荡”称：此次蒋军“扫荡”，是在解放军大反攻面前的绝望挣扎，与今年一、二月首次，及六月二次“扫荡”性质完全不同。自八月解放叶挺（盐城）大捷后，苏北蒋后已由坚持转入反攻新阶段。蒋军对此北接鲁南，西临津浦重要战略地区之反攻极为震恐，乃自沭（阳）淮（阴）公路等重要防线东拼西凑一万余人，对淮涟阜间淤黄河两岸作野蛮“扫荡”，以期阻扰解放军之强大反攻。但蒋军倾全力“扫荡”地区，亦仅及全苏北八分之一而已。记者继称：六月间蒋军二次“扫荡”，尚图打通涟（水）阜（宁）公路，构筑据点，以期久占。但此次则到处流窜抢劫，即重镇益林亦两占两撤，不敢久驻。最后解放军向敌兵力空虚之沭淮路略加攻击，即控制该路八十里，迫使蒋军回头救援，“扫荡”即迅速被我粉碎。记者又称：此次“扫荡”之另一特点，乃绝望挣扎。蒋军士气颓丧，战斗力空前低落，虽集结万人之众，仍胆小如鼠，爬行如龟，自涟（水）东徐集至淮安苏咀三十里，就走了三天，宿营庄子相距不敢超过五里，一闻枪声。即紧缩龟头不敢动弹。占东沟蒋军，夜间高燃汽油灯，照亮四野，借以壮胆。此次蒋军“扫荡”前后共二十天（九月十一日至三十日），较之首次“扫荡”四十天，二次二十五天均大为缩短。反观我军民则充满胜利信心，一面抗击敌人，一面仍继续进行土改。管计沟妇女三人即俘获蒋军一名，其他民兵与徒手群众俘获匪伪达二十余人之多，敌我形势之急剧变化于此可见。
    【新华社华中十三日电】迟到消息：苏中如（皋）东、泰县、紫石（新县位于如皋以北）及海（安）泰（州）线南新恢复之石庄区，两万群众于中秋节（上月二十九）之夜对敌展开强大政治攻势。是夜上述各地举行火炬游行，游行行列浩浩荡荡直逼蒋伪据点碉堡脚下，口号声响澈云霄。如东车挡口敌吓得狼狈逃往马塘，该据点当即收复。其他据点敌人亦吓得一声不响，缩在碉堡里不敢露头。泰县游行队伍进至回家垛据点时，群众怒将该据点包围，并把恶霸陈宪有拖至碉堡下正法；这时，土著蒋伪家属纷纷踊进据点拉着自己亲人抱头痛哭，要失足的丈夫、儿子乘中秋佳节悔过自新，回家团圆。土蒋多写信叫家属带给群众，要求戴罪立功，并有林光然、陶画宽等十人携械回归。紫石农民开大会预审“还乡团”首要分子，争取胁从分子。如皋之石庄敌据点也有三十余人被争取携械归来。
