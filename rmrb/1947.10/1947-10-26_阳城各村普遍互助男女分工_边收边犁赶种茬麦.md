    [This Newspaper Taiyue 24th Dispatch] "Sowing wheat after the Frost's Descent wastes seeds and yields a poor harvest." Yangcheng villages are making every effort to rush-sow stubble wheat. Local experience shows that stubble wheat should be sown before the Frost's Descent, but continuous autumn rains have delayed the autumn harvest and sowing. With the Frost's Descent approaching, the stubble wheat has not yet been sown. In addition to mobilizing all men, women, and children, each village has devised various methods to speed up sowing and make a breakthrough in stubble wheat production: (1) Expanding mutual aid groups, harvesting, plowing, and sowing simultaneously. Villages in the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Districts are universally practicing mutual aid and labor exchange between groups and villages, harvesting and plowing simultaneously. After completing the sowing of their own wheat, the Li Wenlian mutual aid group in Beiciciying sent five people to Ciciyingpo to help with sowing. (2) Clearly defining the division of labor between men and women. Hetou Village adopted the "five specialized" method: First, women specialize in reaping; second, young people specialize in carrying and threshing; third, old men specialize in plowing and sowing; fourth, children specialize in herding livestock and picking up stubble; fifth, wives specialize in taking care of children and cooking. Starting the next day, priority was given to families of soldiers and civilian laborers participating in the war. In four days, they carried 1,200 loads of manure (excluding smoked manure), and reaped 43.7 mu of grain and 50.07 mu of black beans. (3) Working early and late to seize the time. The Li Wenlian group in Beiciciying spread 900 loads of manure in one night. The Jiangli Production Committee in the First District stipulated that stubble should be pulled at night and the fields irrigated at dawn. All work must be done early and late. Starting on the 10th, inspections were carried out every night, and the amount of work done in one day was more than one and a half days' worth in the past. Shangmen Natural Village planted more than 200 mu of wheat in one day. (4) Organizing non-agricultural production personnel and livestock to participate in agricultural production. The Xiling Village government and cooperative in the Second District merged their offices. Two cadres insisted on working, while the remaining cadres, coal miners, sieve-weaving workers, and other 93 people all participated in mutual aid and rushed to sow stubble wheat. (5) Changing to use sheep manure and oil cake fertilizer to save labor on carrying manure. Qinchi Village used oil cake to plant 426 mu of wheat, saving 978 labor days. Jiangli also saved labor on carrying manure by buying oil cake and sheep manure for the fields. Under these active actions, each village has full confidence in completing sowing around the time of the Frost's Descent. The First Joint Village in the Fourth District has already planted more than 11,890 mu, and the remaining 3,333 mu are guaranteed to be completed before and after the Frost's Descent.

　　阳城各村普遍互助男女分工
  　边收边犁赶种茬麦
    【本报太岳二十四日电】“霜降种麦费籽收成淡”，阳城各村全力赶种茬麦。当地改茬麦经验，都在霜降前，可是秋雨连绵，误了秋收秋种，眼看霜降将到，茬麦还未种上，各村除男女老少齐动手外，又想出各种赶种办法，突击茬麦：（一）扩大互助组，边收边犁种。二、四、五区各村，普遍进行组与组村与村互助变工，一面收割，一面犁种。北次营李文练互助组，把本组的麦子种完后，就派五个人去次营坡帮助种麦。（二）男女明确分工。河头村用“五专”办法，一、妇女专门割，二、青年专门担，带打场，三、老汉专门犁种，四、小孩专门挡牲口，拾圪渣，五、老婆专门看娃做饭。第二天就开始，先给军属参战民夫干，在四天内担粪一千二百担（没统计薰粪），割完谷四十三亩七分，黑豆五十亩零七分。（三）起早摸黑抢作。北次营李文炼组，一夜匀粪九百担。一区匠礼生产委员会，订出黑夜拔谷茬，五更灌圪垠，一切工作都要起早摸黑干，十日开始，当天晚上检查，一天的活就顶过去一天半做的多。上门自然村，一天种了二百多亩麦。（四）组织非农业生产人畜，参加农业生产。二区西岭村公所与合作社合并办公，两个干部坚持工作，其余干部、煤窑工人、织罗底工人等九十三人，都参加了互助，抢种茬麦。（五）改用卧羊、油饼肥料，节省担粪劳力。芹池村用油饼种麦四百二十六亩，省出劳力九百七十八个；匠礼买油饼、卧羊上地，也省出了担粪的劳力。各村在这样积极行动下，有充分信心在霜降前后种完，四区一联村已种了一万一千八百九十余亩，其余三千三百三十三亩，保证在霜降前后全部完成。
