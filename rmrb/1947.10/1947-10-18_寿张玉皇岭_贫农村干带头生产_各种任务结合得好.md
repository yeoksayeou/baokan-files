　　Yu Huangling in Shou Zhang
  　Poor Peasant Cadres Lead Production
  　Integrating Various Tasks Well
    [This dispatch from our newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu office, dated the 16th] In Yu Huangling Village, District One, Shou Zhang, poor peasant cadres are leading production, organizing mutual aid, and effectively integrating the four major tasks of war support, production, flood prevention, dike protection, and land review. The village has 167 households, with 25 military dependents and martyrs' families needing care. When tasks piled up, they mobilized 107 laborers in a single day. Labor is a major problem in production. Furthermore, poor peasants account for two-thirds of the village. After receiving land, they faced difficulties with production tools and livestock. 128 households had no cattle. Therefore, only by organizing could they solve the difficulties in this year's production. Under these circumstances, Yu Huangling Village created a mutual aid organization integrating war support, flood prevention, dike protection, production, and land review. As a result, the beans and corn were hoed two or three times, ensuring that not a single plot of land was left uncultivated in any household. The crops also grew better than in other villages. The land review turned up a large amount of landlords' silverware, clothing, and furniture. War support and dike protection work were also successfully completed. The method involved organizing four large groups according to street divisions, with each large group divided into three smaller groups. If a small group couldn't handle the work, the large group would adjust. Priority was given to doing work for those on assignment and for military families. When the village had tasks, men, women, old, and young all pitched in. The autumn harvest is now complete, and they are rushing to plant wheat. The reason for the village's good organization is the establishment of poor peasant backbone elements and the leadership's adherence to the mass line. The village instructor, village head, militia squad leader, and self-defense captain are all poor peasants. They are extremely enthusiastic about production, working in the office during the day and watering gardens at night. The model squad leader chopped two mu of sorghum in one day and also led the militia to work actively. Under their influence, everyone became active and happily said, "Without mutual aid, it would be impossible to do this year's work well."

  　贫农村干带头生产
  　各种任务结合得好
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】寿张一区玉皇岭村，贫农村干带头生产，组织互助，战勤、生产、防泛、护堤、复查四大任务结合好。该村一百六十七户，要照顾的军工烈属二十五户，任务紧到一块时，一日曾出劳力一百零七人，生产中劳力是大问题；另外该村贫农占三分之二，得到土地后生产工具畜力都困难，一百二十八户没牛，因此只有组织起来，才能解决今年生产中的困难。玉皇岭村就在这种情形下，创造了战勤、防泛、护堤、生产、复查结合的互助组织，结果豆子、棒子均锄了二、三遍，作到家家户户没荒一分地，庄稼也比外村长得好，复查搞出地主银器、衣服、家具甚多，战勤及护堤工作，均胜利完成。其办法是按街道组织四大组，每个大组分三个小组，如小组的活做不过来，以大组为单位调剂，先给出差的人及军属作活，村里有任务时，男女老少齐动手。现秋收已完，正在突击种麦。该村组织好的原因是树立了贫农骨干，领导走了群众路线，村干以身作则带头干。村指导员、村长、民兵班长自卫队长都是贫农，他们生产的积极性极高，白天办公夜里浇园，模范班长一天砍了二亩高粱，还领导民兵积极干，在他们的影响下，大家都积极起来，很高兴说：“今年的活不互助，没法作好。”
