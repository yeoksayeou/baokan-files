Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Various sources: The two largest labor organizations in the US—the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and the American Federation of Labor (AFL)—recently held their annual meetings. The CIO annual meeting opened in Boston on the 13th, with 600 delegates attending. During the meeting, when foreign policy was discussed, "sharp debates and even open quarrels occurred between those who denounced American diplomacy as a tool of Wall Street and those who defended American foreign policy." (United Press International, 16th) Finally, on the 16th, both sides passed a middle-ground foreign policy resolution, calling on "all countries" to stop talking about war, universally disarm, not interfere in the national independence of other countries, and internationally manage and supervise atomic energy. On domestic issues, the conference decided on the 16th to conduct a door-to-door "labor election campaign" in next year's election, mobilizing 65 million to 70 million voters to register (note: the number of registered voters in the 1946 election was 59 million) to participate in the election. Although the proposal did not mention supporting any particular candidate, when a union leader mentioned former Vice President Wallace at the time, he was greeted with cheers from the delegates. On the 17th, former Chairman Murray, in his speech after being elected for the eighth time as Chairman of the CIO, fiercely attacked the infamous Taft-Hartley anti-labor law, denounced the reactionary forces currently controlling the United States, and demanded the restoration of price controls. Meanwhile, the 66th annual meeting of the AFL was held in San Francisco. Under the control of AFL President Green, Vice Presidents Woll and Hutcheson, and other labor movement bureaucrats who were loyal servants of American monopoly capital, the conference passed reactionary resolutions on domestic and foreign policies. However, this policy of surrender and betrayal by the upper echelons of the AFL will only further expose their reactionary faces and lead to isolation among their lower-level unions and workers, thereby deepening their internal divisions. The fierce debate and disagreement caused by the conservative United Mine Workers President Lewis's firm opposition to the "non-Communist affidavit" in the Taft-Hartley Act is one example. In the "election" on the 16th, Green was re-elected as President of the AFL for the 24th time, and Meany was re-elected as Treasurer.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Moscow dispatch: On the eve of the annual meetings of the AFL and CIO in the United States, the Soviet newspaper Labor commented: Foreign policy issues are bound to occupy a prominent place in the two meetings. The AFL leaders will undoubtedly support the reactionary line of Truman and Marshall without reservation. AFL President Green, Vice Presidents Woll, Hutcheson, and others have long been loyal lackeys of American imperialism. American warmongers have assigned them specific tasks in implementing the "Truman Doctrine" and the "Marshall Plan," namely, to undermine the unity of the world's trade unions, subvert the World Federation of Trade Unions, and slander the Soviet trade union movement. However, all their attempts to split the trade union movements in Europe and Latin America have been countered by the trade unions, and even the leaders of the AFL cannot boast of any achievements. The CIO will also pay attention to foreign policy issues. Although last year's CIO conference unanimously condemned the Truman government's foreign policy, there are also supporters of the "Truman Doctrine" within the CIO. Not long ago, some reactionary CIO leaders in New York attempted to have CIO local unions pass resolutions supporting the "Truman Doctrine," but this move was opposed by the majority. They will certainly make the same attempt at this CIO conference.

　　美两大劳工组织同时召开年会
  　产联呼吁终止战争叫嚣
    劳联仍为独占资本奴仆所把持
    【新华社陕北十九日电】各方讯：美国两大劳工组织——产业工会联合会与美国劳工联合会，最近分别召开年会。产联年会十三日于波斯顿开幕，到有代表六百人。会议当中讨论到外交政策时，“斥责美国外交为华尔街工具的人与为美国外交政策辩护人之间，发生了尖锐的辩论，甚至公开的争吵。”（合众社十六日电）最后，双方于十六日通过中间性的外交政策决议，即呼吁“各国”终止谈论战争、普遍裁军、不干涉他国民族独立、国际共管及监督原子能等。在内政问题上，大会于十六日决定于明年大选中挨家挨户“进行劳工竞选运动，”动员六千五百万至七千万选民前往登记（按：四六年大选中之登记选民为五千九百万），参加选举。议案中虽未提出赞成何种候选人，但当时某工会领袖提及前副总统华莱士时，博得了到会代表的欢呼。十七日前主席莫莱在其第八次当选为产联主席后之演说中，更猛烈攻击臭名远扬的塔虎脱——哈特莱反劳工法，痛斥现正控制美国的反动势力，要求恢复物价管制。同时，劳联之六十六届年会则在旧金山举行。会议在美国独占资本忠实奴仆劳联主席格林、副主席合尔、胡契逊等工运官僚的把持下，通过了反动的内外政策决议。但劳联上层分子这种投降叛卖政策，只会在其下层工会及工人中更加暴露其反动面貌而陷于孤立，从而加深其内部的分裂。保守的矿工联合会主席路易士，在会上因坚决反对实行塔虎脱法案中“无共产党人誓约”所引起的剧烈的争论与分歧，即是一例。会议于十六日之“选举”中，格林第二十四次连任劳联主席，梅尼连任司库。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】莫斯科讯：在美劳联与产联召开年会前夕，苏联劳动报评称：外交政策问题势必在两会议中占显著地位。劳联领袖们无疑将无保留的支持杜鲁门——马歇尔的反动路线。劳联主席格林、副主席伍尔、胡契逊等人，早就是美帝国主义的忠实奴才。美国战争贩子在实现“杜鲁门主义”与“马歇尔计划”中，已给他们指定了确定的任务，即破坏世界联运的团结，颠覆世界职工联盟，诽谤苏联职工运动等。然而，他们一切分裂欧洲、拉丁美洲职工运动的企图，都遭到职工会的反击，连劳联的领袖也不能吹嘘他们有什么成就。产联亦将注意外交政策问题。去年产联会议虽一致谴责杜鲁门政府的外交政策，但产联内亦有“杜鲁门主义”的拥护者。不久前，纽约一些产联反动领袖曾企图使产联地方工会通过支持“杜鲁门主义”的决议，然此举遭到大多数人的反对。他们在这次产联会上，一定会作同样的尝试。
