Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: Comprehensive reports: The renewed rise in commodity prices in Shanghai since the Mid-Autumn Festival has caused extreme panic within the Chiang government. Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen is fearing the arrival of new rice riots amidst the soaring rice prices. Chiang bandit Shanghai Garrison Commander Xuan TieWu confessed: "Due to the deep economic crisis, crime, begging, and suicide rates have surged in Shanghai. The entire city is in a state of anarchy, and the whole situation has entered a critical period." The Chiang bandit clique, in order to salvage this grave situation, has been frantically trying its best to deal with commodity prices. The Chiang National Economic Commission held a special meeting on the 9th to discuss countermeasures and sent Shi Kuiling and two others to Shanghai to investigate. Chiang's Minister of Food Yu Feipeng rushed to Shanghai on the 13th to hold an "emergency meeting" with the Chiang authorities in Shanghai. The so-called "major officials" of the Chiang government held a meeting all night on the 14th at Chiang Kai-shek's private residence to discuss "emergency and strict measures" to deal with commodity prices. Chen Qitian, the political beggar and Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, also hastily drafted various "Measures for Banning Illegal Trade and Controlling" which were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Shanghai Police Chief Yu Shuping also ran back and forth between Nanjing and Shanghai. Xuan Tiewu and Wu Guozhen jointly formulated rice and cotton monopoly "rationing methods" and so-called "economic suppression measures." Chiang Kai-shek, amidst this unprecedented defeat in the civil war and the great chaos in the economic system, was even more restless, holding continuous meetings with his senior officials in Nanjing on the 18th to discuss solutions, and on the 21st, he personally flew to Shanghai to "inquire" about the commodity price situation. The reactionary measures taken by the Chiang bandit authorities for this purpose are to further implement their bloody terrorist policies against the private business community by mobilizing their "economic agents" again, and taking the opportunity to extort large sums of money. Since the 9th, the Shanghai Chiang Police Bureau and the Garrison Headquarters have been constantly dispatching large numbers of "economic police" to search the market, supervise market transactions, and invade various large and small shops to investigate and register properties such as rice, grain, cotton, yarn, textiles, fuel, as well as foreign currency and gold. Compulsory purchase of merchants' cotton reserves at the original price to achieve the purpose of extortion. They even arrested merchants in large numbers under the pretext of "speculation" and "hoarding," and the Garrison Headquarters declared that all arrested merchants would be "tried by military law" and "can be killed at any time." However, all the methods of the Chiang bandit clique cannot save the continued development of its economic crisis. Even with a large number of police dispatched to arrest people, rice prices still rose to a new high of 900,000 yuan per dan on the 16th. Even on the very day that Chiang Kai-shek, the bandit leader, personally flew to Shanghai to suppress, cotton prices continued to rise, according to the Associated Press. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Associated Press on the 21st, Shanghai economists believe that as a result of the Chiang government's abuse of terror, even if commodity prices fall slightly temporarily, the issuance of large denomination banknotes will inevitably cause fluctuations again.

    上海物价狂涨
    蒋匪镇压无效
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】综合消息：自中秋以来的上海物价之再度上涨，已使蒋政府极度慌张。上海蒋家市长吴国桢在米价飞涨之下，已在惧怕新的米骚动之到来。蒋匪沪警备司令宣铁吾供认：“由于经济危机深刻，上海犯罪、讨饭及自杀率激增，全市已处于无政府状态，整个局势已进入非常时期。”蒋匪集团为挽救此严重局面，近日正手忙脚乱倾其全力以对付物价。蒋匪全国经济委员会于九日特开会讨论对策，并派施奎龄等三人赴沪调查。蒋粮食部长俞飞鹏于十三日急忙赴沪，与沪市蒋当局举行“紧急会议”。蒋政府中所谓“主要官员”，十四日整夜在蒋介石私邸举行会议，讨论对物价的“紧急严厉措施”。蒋经济部副部长政治乞丐陈启天亦慌忙拟出“取缔非法贸易管制办法”多种，送行政院批准。沪警察局长俞叔平也于南京、上海间跑来跑去，宣铁吾与吴国桢一连拟出米棉专卖“配给办法”及所谓“经济戡乱办法”。蒋介石于此内战空前失利及经济体系大混乱之下，更是坐卧不安，十八日在南京与其高级官员举行连续会议商讨办法，并于二十一日亲自飞沪“垂询”物价情形。蒋匪当局对此所采取之反动措施，为又动员其“经济特务”对民间商业界，进一步实行其血腥恐怖政策，并乘机大批勒索。自九日起，上海蒋记警察局及警备司令部即不断派出大批“经济警察”搜察市场，监督市场交易，侵入各大小商店，调查登记大米、粮食、棉、纱、纺织品、燃料以及外币、黄金等类财产。按原价强迫收购商人之棉花存底，以达勒索目的。甚至在“投机”“囤积”名义下，大批逮捕商人，警备部并宣称：一切被捕商人均“依军法审判”，且“随时可杀。”然蒋匪集团之一切办法，均挽救不了其经济危机之继续发展。纵令大批警察出动捕人，十六日米价仍然上涨至每担九十万元之新高峰。甚至当蒋介石匪首亲自飞到上海镇压之当日，据合众社报导，棉花价格仍继续上涨。据合众社上海二十一日消息，沪经济家相信，蒋政府滥施恐怖的结果，物价即使暂时略有下降，但大票面钞之发行，势必再度引起波动。
