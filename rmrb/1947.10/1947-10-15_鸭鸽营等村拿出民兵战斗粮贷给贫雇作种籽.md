　　Ya Ge Ying and Other Villages Provide Militia Combat Grain as Seed Loan to Poor and Hired Peasants
　　[Report from Lin Cheng by Our Newspaper] In order to solve the wheat seed difficulties for poor and hired peasants who have just been emancipated or not thoroughly emancipated, the militia of Dongxi Ya Ge Ying and Bei Gao Villages took out 4,350 catties of combat grain wheat and lent it to the poor and hired masses at low interest, to be repaid when the wheat is harvested next year. This solved the wheat seed problem for 435 mu of land. Other villages, such as Shankou, Li Jia Zhuang, and Yan Jia Zhuang, also successively provided one dan and three dou of wheat seeds to help solve the wheat seed difficulties of poor and hired peasants in Zhao Jia Zhuang (Zhao Jia Zhuang did not have militia combat grain). (Zhen Wen)
　　[Another Dispatch] Tian Qingli, a labor hero from the fifth district of Weichang, returned to his village after attending a meeting in the district. He first convened an enlarged meeting of the production committee and cadres to discuss how to harvest autumn crops and plant wheat. After repeated discussions by all the cadres, everyone decided to complete the irrigation of paddy fields by August 15th, harvest all mature crops, plow all stubble fields once, and organize forces to carry out fertilizer transportation in order to prepare for wheat planting at any time (because wheat planting in the fifth district is later than in other districts). He proposed that "not planting one hundred mu cannot yield one hundred shi." Following Tian hero's example, he took out five dou of wheat seeds to give to the poor masses who had just been emancipated and had no wheat seeds. The next night, mutual aid teams were used as units to deliberate and formulate plans. According to statistics from just two days, the entire village has already planted sixty-five mu.

　　鸭鸽营等村拿出民兵战斗粮贷给贫雇作种籽
    【本报临城讯】为了解决才翻身或翻身不透的贫雇农麦种困难，东西鸭鸽营、北高村民兵拿出战斗粮麦子四千三百五十斤，低利贷给贫雇群众，到明年打下麦子再还。这样解决了四百三十五亩的麦种困难，其他山口、李家庄、阎家庄，亦先后拿出了一石三斗麦种，帮助解决赵家庄的贫雇农麦种困难问题（赵家庄没有民兵战斗粮）。（振文）
    【又讯】五区围场劳动英雄田清力在区参加开会回到村里，首先召开生产委员会及干部扩大会，商量如何秋收种麦，经全体干部反复讨论后，大家决定在八月十五日前完成水地润种，熟庄稼全部收回，茬地全部耕一遍，组织力量突击运肥，准备随时种麦（因五区种麦较其他区晚）。提出了“不种百亩不能打百石”，随着田英雄又拿出了五斗麦种给才翻身无麦种的贫苦群众种，次日晚上又以互助组为单位，进行酝酿，订计划，现仅据两天统计，全村已种六十五亩。
