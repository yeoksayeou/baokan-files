　　Seriously Inspect and Solve the Difficulties of Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers in Wheat Planting
　　From the wheat planting inspection in the Wu'an area, a significant problem is the genuine in-depth understanding of the poor peasants and hired laborers, and the solving of their wheat planting difficulties. We cannot simply rely on the statistical figures in the reports, but must genuinely inspect to make it work. For example, in the thirteen villages of the Nan Da Cooperative in the Third District, there are 36,700 mu of land, and 21,225 mu of wheat have been planted, completing 58 percent. From the perspective of the task, it has already exceeded the goal. However, inspecting village by village reveals that it is extremely uneven, and inspecting household by household shows even greater disparities. Take Nan Da Cooperative as an example: the whole village has 6,000 mu of land, and 3,000 mu have been planted. The village cadres developed a sense of complacency and relaxed their leadership in wheat planting. Later, after inspecting each household, it was found that 57 households had not planted even one-third of their land. Those who planted the most were the village cadres, activists, and middle-peasant households, while most of these 57 households were poor peasants and hired laborers who had just been liberated. The main difficulties were wheat seeds and livestock. He Laishan's wife said: "My family of seven has 39 mu of land. Because my husband was sick in the summer, we borrowed wheat from the Farmers' Association to feed him. During the intercropping of wheat, we had no seeds, so we only intercropped eight mu. We wanted to intercrop a few more mu, but we couldn't because we didn't have wheat seeds, and we didn't dare to borrow from the village cadres again." Zhang Shufang also only planted ten mu out of 35 mu due to difficulties with wheat seeds and livestock. After the leadership inspected this problem, they solved it specifically, and immediately planted another 287 mu of wheat. Take Shucun as another example: the whole village has 5,530 mu of land, but only 2,503 mu have been planted. Eighty households have only planted 20 percent, and seventeen households have not planted a single mu. These seventeen households are poor peasants who have just been allocated land, lacking livestock, farm tools, and wheat seeds, and struggling with their livelihoods, busy with gathering and chopping. The village cadres of Shaozhuang Village reported to the district that they had planted 2,000 mu of wheat, but after inspecting each household, it was found that only 1,500 mu had been planted. The result of the household-by-household inspection in Rushan Village of the Second District was that the liberated poor peasants and hired laborers lacked 4,000 jin of wheat seeds. After the cooperative solved this difficulty, they all planted 50 percent.

### 认真检查解决贫雇种麦困难

　　认真检查解决贫雇种麦困难
    从武安这一段生产种麦检查来看，真正深入贫雇，解决他们的种麦困难是一个很大问题。我们不能光看汇报上的统计数字，而必须真正去检查才能行。如三区南大社基点十三个村，有地三万六千七百亩，种麦子二万一千二百二十五亩，已经完成了百分之五十八，从任务上说，是已经超过了，但是从一个村一个村来检查是极不普遍的，一个户一个户来检查更是相差太远，就拿南大社说：全村六千亩地，种上了三千亩，村干部自满情绪就产生了，便放松种麦领导，后来经一户一户检查，还有五十七户未种到三分之一，种的最多的是村干部积极分子，和中农户，而这五十七户大半是刚翻身的贫雇。主要的困难是麦种牲口，何来山的老婆说：我家七口人有地三十九亩，因俺男人夏天生病，借了农会的麦子给病人吃了，在串麦时没有籽种，只串了八亩，还想串几亩，因没有麦种不能串，也不敢再向村干部借，张树芳也因为麦种牲口困难，三十五亩地只种了十亩。当领导上检查这问题以后，便分别具体解决，当即又种麦二百八十七亩。再拿淑村来看，全村土地五千五百三十亩，才种了二千五百零三亩，有八十户才种到百分之二十，十七户根本没种一亩，这十七户是刚分到土地的贫农没牲口、没农具、没麦种、生活困难，忙于拾砍。邵庄村村干部在区上汇报说：种麦二千亩，经一户一户检查后，才种到一千五百余亩。二区儒山村挨户检查的结果，翻身贫雇，缺麦种四千斤，合作社把这个困难解决后，才都种到百分之五十。
