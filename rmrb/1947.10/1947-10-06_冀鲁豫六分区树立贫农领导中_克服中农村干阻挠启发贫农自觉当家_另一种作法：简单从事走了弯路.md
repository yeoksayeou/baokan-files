[This report from our newspaper in Ji-Lu-Yu on the 4th] Since the Sixth District Party Committee's activist conference in May, most cadres have grasped the spirit of the District Committee regarding the issue of establishing a leading core of poor peasants and have boldly mobilized the poor peasants and united with the middle peasants. However, due to an inadequate and inconsistent understanding of poor peasants, two different approaches have emerged in the work. For example, in Boping, after a party member training class, they found the key to ideological mobilization. Each district convened a poor peasant congress (including middle and rich peasant cadres), conducted grievance meetings, carried out turn-over examinations, commended model individuals, and identified activists. The leadership promptly supported them boldly, allowing the poor peasants to return to their activities and organize turn-over examination groups. In each village, the poor peasants engaged in face-to-face grievance sessions. The middle peasants acknowledged that the poor peasants suffered more and were more aggrieved, expressing their willingness not to share the fruits of struggle. On the other hand, the poor peasants, through grievance sessions, enhanced their class consciousness, realized that they must take the lead to thoroughly turn the tables, and demanded to take charge. When middle peasant cadres said, "We've been working for so long, and now you want the poor peasants to take charge; it's like killing the donkey after it's done its work," the poor peasants said, "You don't understand how much suffering and how many pits the poor peasants have. We are taking charge to fill the poverty pits." The middle peasants said, "If you take charge, we won't work anymore." The poor peasants responded, "Isn't your leadership in turning the tables for the sake of the suffering poor? Why don't you listen to us?" The middle peasants finally said, "In the future, we'll discuss and come to an understanding." The middle peasants' demands were: not to be bullied and not to be overthrown (through struggle). The leadership supported the middle peasants, unified the opinions of the middle and poor peasants, and confronted the landlord class. At this time, party members with middle peasant backgrounds also asked, "Will the Party be in charge in the future? If it's not in charge, what's the point of the Party?" The leadership explained, "Whom does the Party serve? Who is the master? Listening to the master is being in charge." The poor peasants also said, "It's about gathering the opinions of the poor peasants and taking the lead." After this debate, the thinking of both the middle and poor peasants was greatly elevated. This shows that the poor peasants have the ability and capacity to lead themselves and unite with the middle peasants. It also proves that only when the poor peasant class is truly mobilized can it lead the broad masses in a thorough struggle. This was also the case in Wang Haizhu and other villages in the Third District of Dong'a. Another approach in the work was to adopt simple methods, such as simply assigning a few poor peasants to leadership positions. For example, in some areas, at peasant or poor peasant congresses, the leadership proposed establishing a leading core of poor peasants, simply deliberated, and then let the poor peasants voluntarily become the core. Or, at the poor peasant representatives' meeting, they simply held elections. Or, the issue of establishing a leading core of poor peasants was conveyed among the cadres, and then the work team went to the village to convene a congress and elected poor peasants as the core on behalf of the masses. There were even areas where they wrote an order, telling each village to quickly establish a core and submit a list to the district within a few days. The result of this simplistic approach was either to completely discard the old organization, even squeezing out heroes and model individuals, or to make the old village cadres unenthusiastic and the new village cadres unable to rise. Even if new cadres were forcibly installed, they often became puppets, with the old cadres still controlling everything and obstructing the work. The new cadre of Zhuxian × village said to the district cadre, "I won't take charge unless you come." Facts prove that establishing a leading core of poor peasants should focus on ideological mobilization, raising the poor peasants ideologically, consciously and automatically grasping leadership, and mobilizing the entire poor peasant class to support their leadership. Only in this way can they have strength, and the middle peasants will follow, uniting to confront the landlord class. If orders are issued and everything is done on their behalf, it may seem lively on the surface, but in reality, the poor peasants cannot be mobilized and lack strength. The middle peasants hesitate and stand by to see which way the wind blows, contacting the landlord class. The landlords take the opportunity to exploit loopholes, spread rumors, and undermine the effort, leaving the poor peasants isolated. We should be very vigilant against this in our work.

　　冀鲁豫六分区树立贫农领导中
  　克服中农村干阻挠启发贫农自觉当家
  　另一种作法：简单从事走了弯路
    【本报冀鲁豫四日电】六地委自五月活动分子会后，在树立贫农领导骨干问题上，大部分干部掌握了地委会的精神，大胆的发动了贫农，联合了中农；但由于对贫农认识不深刻，不一致，在工作中产生了两种不同的作法。如博平经过党员训练班，摸着思想发动的门路，各区都召开了贫农大会（包括中农村干在内），经过诉苦，进行翻身检查，表扬了模范，发现了积极分子，领导上及时撑腰大胆放手，让贫农回去活动，组织翻身检查团。在各村中贫农面对面的诉苦比苦中，中农承认了贫农受苦多，吃气大，向贫农表示不分果实；另一方面，贫农从诉苦中提高了自己阶级觉悟，体会到自己要彻底翻身，必须自己领着干，要求当家。当中农成份村干说“俺干了多时又叫贫农当家是卸磨杀驴”时，贫农说：“你们不了解贫农有多大的苦，多大的坑，我们才当家填穷坑的。”中农说：“你当家俺不干了。”贫农说：“你们领导翻身还不是为了受苦受难的穷人吗？为什么不听我们的话呢？”中农最后表示：“今后有意见，咱们商量打通才行。”中农的要求是：今后不受气，不垮台（被斗）。领导上给中农撑一下腰，统一中贫农意见，面对地主阶级。这时中农成份的党员也提出：“今后党是否当家？不当家要党干啥？”领导上说明：“党是给谁服务的？谁是主人，听主人的话，就是当家。”贫农也说：“就是把贫农意见集中起来，带头干的。”经过这一番争论，中贫农思想都大大提高，这说明贫农是有本领有能力来领导自己，并联合中农的；同时也证明只有贫农阶层真正发动起来，才能带领广大群众进行彻底斗争。这在东阿三区王海注等村也是这样情形。另一种作法是在工作中采取简单从事的，按上几个贫农到领导机关中去的办法。如个别地区在农民或贫农大会上，领导上提出树立贫农骨干，简单酝酿就让贫农自主勇当骨干或在贫农代表，简单选举或是把树立贫农骨干问题在干部中传达了，就由工作员到村召开大会，代群众选举贫农当骨干；甚至还有的地区写一道命令，叫各村赶快树立骨干，限几天把名册汇送到区。这种简单作风的结果，不是把老组织完全踢开不要，甚至英雄模范也被挤掉，就是老村干不起劲，新村干起不来，即便是硬按上的新干部，也往往当傀儡，老干部仍然把持一切，障碍工作。筑先×村新干对区干说：“你不来俺就不当家了。”事实证明，树立贫农骨干，应是抓住思想发动，把贫农从思想上提高，自觉自动的掌握领导权，并将整个贫农阶层发动起来，支持了自己的领导权，这样才有力量，中农也就会跟着走，团结一致，面对地主。如果命令包办代替，表面上好象是轰轰烈烈，实际上贫农动不起来，没力量，中农犹豫旁观，站在一边看风头，与地主阶级联系，地主更趁机会钻空子，造谣破坏，贫农就会孤立，在工作中是应十分警惕的。
