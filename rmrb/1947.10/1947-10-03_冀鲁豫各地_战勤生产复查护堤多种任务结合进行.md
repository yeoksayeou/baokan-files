Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Provinces
Combined War Support, Production Review, and Levee Protection

[Report from our Hebei, Shandong, and Henan correspondent on the 1st] According to reports from various locations, war support tasks are currently heavy, and the autumn harvest and wheat planting are also urgent. In northern Hebei, there is a review underway; in southern Henan, there is guerilla warfare and land redistribution; and some counties along the Yellow River need to protect the levees. Many regions are combining these multiple tasks well. For example, the women of Asongji, seeing that the sorghum was ripe and the men had left on missions, automatically organized to cut the sorghum. Ten people formed a group, with seven cutting and three stripping the heads. One group could cut ten mu per day, and they finished cutting all the sorghum in the village in three days. Then they bundled, threshed, and the elderly class used carts to pull the sorghum stalks home. Not only was production good, but they also held meetings every night to conduct reviews. The women of Quzhuang recognized the importance of river management work. In order not to affect the men's river management work, they held their own meetings to establish a review and production plan: (1) Be even more thorough than the men at home; (2) Ensure that not a single grain is left in the fields; (3) Guarantee sentry duty and ensure that landlords cannot escape; (4) Guarantee the supply of anti-offensive shoes, anti-offensive grain, and flour for river defense during the autumn harvest. After discussion, all the women were very confident in completing the plan and have already begun to take action. In Taizhuang, Second District, many young men could not produce at home due to river management work, and the autumn harvest was approaching. In addition to the organization of large mutual aid by all the villagers, young and old, Shen Minglin, the director of the Armed Forces Committee, also organized the village's children's sister group into an autumn harvest brigade, divided into thirty small teams, with teachers as brigade commanders and college students as team leaders. Each team set competitive conditions, and meetings were held every night to review progress. Production enthusiasm was high, and they, fifty-four people, turned over 64 mu of sweet potato seedlings. The mutual aid group in Dongwangzhuang, Fifth District of Fan County, was established before the wheat dam construction. The whole village was divided into four groups, and military families and the elderly and weak with no labor were assigned to each group. In order to accommodate those with more or less land, it was stipulated that each mu would contribute ten jin of grain, and military families would contribute five jin, to be shared by those participating in labor. Poor military families and the elderly and weak did not contribute. All village cadres were also assigned to each group and were required to review the plan every night, praising those who were active in work and production and criticizing those who were not. Now the whole village is very enthusiastic. They feel that mutual aid saves labor and are preparing to pool shares to do business. All four groups in the village plan to establish a consumer cooperative. Since the review in Zhang Gutun, Third District, the fruits of labor have not yet been distributed, and the masses are dissatisfied. However, it is currently the busy season for autumn harvest and wheat planting. Village cadres convened a mass meeting, and after everyone collectively expressed their opinions, it was decided to carry out both the distribution of the fruits of labor and production at the same time. During the day, the production headquarters leads collective production, and during breaks, everyone discusses ways to distribute the fruits of labor. Meetings are held at night to carry out the distribution, and everyone is in high spirits.
After the enemy occupied Chengwu, the Goucunji working group received a letter from the district, requiring the combination of mass movements, guerrilla warfare, war support, and production. The cadres of the group held a joint meeting with the village cadres to discuss how to combine these four major tasks. The result of the discussion was that the original Emancipation Committee was responsible for implementing land investigation and developing the organization. The headquarters was responsible for preparing war support, and the president of the Farmers' Association (i.e., the chairman of the Emancipation Committee) concurrently served as the instructor. The Land Protection Team and the Self-Defense Forces concentrated daily on launching attacks near Chengguan to cover various tasks. When they discussed production, everyone believed that a production committee should be organized, divided into youth groups, elderly groups, youth groups, and women's groups, under the leadership of the headquarters. Everyone said, "With this combination, no matter how much work there is, it doesn't matter." Some also said, "Although everyone is in charge of a part, every aspect is important, and we must work together." Each village in the Third District of northern Yuncheng is preparing all labor and materials to prepare for plowing and sowing wheat. Qishengmiao Village, with more than 350 households, contributed 29 stretchers, 160 laborers, and two large carts, as well as 107 large and small livestock, estimated to be able to sow more than 21 qing of wheat land, divided into 45 groups, each group responsible for more than 40 mu, decided to first plow and sow for military families and those on war support missions.

　　冀鲁豫各地
  　战勤生产复查护堤多种任务结合进行
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】综合各地报导，现因战勤任务繁重，秋收种麦又是刻不容缓，河（黄河）北复查，河南分田游击战，还有些靠黄河的县份要护堤，这多种任务，许多地区都结合的很好。如果阿宋集妇女，看到高粱熟了，男人都出了差，便自动组织起来砍高粱，十人一组，每组七个人砍，三个人截穗，一个组一天能砍十亩，三天工夫全庄高粱就砍完了。接着她们又捆的捆，砸的砸，老年班用车把秫秸拉到家去。不光生产好，每天晚上还开会进行复查，曲庄妇女认识治河工作的重要，为了不影响男人治河工作，自己开会订立了复查生产计划：（一）比男人在家里还彻底；（二）保证地里庄稼一颗不落下；（三）保证站岗放哨，经常控制地主跑不了；（四）在秋收中，保证反攻鞋、反攻粮及河防用面的供给。讨论后，全体妇女都很有信心去完成，并已开始行动。在二区泰庄为了治河，很多青壮年不能在家生产，马上要秋收，除了全庄老少班组织大互助外，武委会主任沈名林，又把全庄儿童姊妹团组织了个秋收大队，下分三十个小队，每小队十八人，教员任大队长，大学生任小队长，各小队订下竞赛条件，每天晚上开会检讨，生产情绪很高，他们五十四人翻红薯秧子六十四亩。范县五区东王庄的互助组，从麦前打堤时就建立了，全村分四组，军属和孤寡无劳力的均到各组，为了有地多的地少的，又规定每亩拿十斤粮食、军属拿五斤，由参加劳动的人共同分，贫苦军属和孤寡不拿，所有村干也分到各组，规定每天晚上检讨计划，工作生产积极的表扬，不积极的批评，计划明天干啥。现在全村情绪很高，他们感到互助起来劳力节余，准备集股作买卖，全村四个组，并计划成立一个消费合作社。三区张顾屯自复查以来，果实还没有分，群众都不满，但目前又值秋忙种麦，村干召开群众大会，经大家集体发表意见，决定分果实和生产一齐搞，白天由生产指挥部领导集体生产，休息时，大家就酝酿分果实的办法，晚上开会进行分，大家情绪很高。
    敌人占领了城武，苟村集工作组接到区的来信，要把群运、游击战争、战勤、生产四大任务结合起来，小组的干部，就同村干召开一个联席会，讨论这四大任务如何结合？讨论的结果是原来的翻身委员会，负责贯彻查田，发展组织。指挥部负责准备战勤，农会长（即翻身会主席）兼指导员，保田队及自卫队，每日集中向城关附近出击，掩护各种工作。他们讨论生产时，大家认为要组织生产委员会，下分青壮组、老年组、少年组及妇女组，归指挥部领导，这样结合法，大伙都说：“这样工作再多也不要紧啦。”也有的说：“虽然各管一段，那一样当紧了，还得下把力一齐干。”郓北三区各村，正准备一切劳力物力，准备犁地种麦。七圣庙村三百五十多户，出担架二十九付，民夫一百六十人，还出两辆大车，下余大小牲口一百零七头，统计能种麦地二十一顷余，划分了四十五组，每组负责四十余亩，决定先给军属及出战勤的犁种。
