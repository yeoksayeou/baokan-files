　　Fan County Third District Solves Poverty and Hired Labor Difficulties
　　Organizing Mutual Aid for Harvesting and Sowing
　　[Our newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 11th dispatch] Cui＠＠ in the Third District of Fan County is rushing to sow wheat and earnestly solving the difficulties of poor farmers. Under the heavy war service tasks, Cui＠＠ organized ten production mutual aid groups, with ten or twelve households in each group, all freely formed. The eleven households of widowed, orphaned, and childless people, and the four households of blind people, were assigned two households to each group. The elderly, children, and women were calculated based on their labor capacity, with some counted as one work unit or half a work unit. Large cattle were counted as two work units, medium-sized cattle as one and a half work units, and small cattle as one work unit. Regarding the issue of feed for the livestock, poor farmers contributed 20 catties of grass and half a catty of feed per mu. When there were war service tasks, each group would dispatch strong young people, while the elderly, children, women, and semi-laborers would all participate in production. The production mutual aid in Cui＠＠ is a relatively good example. When organizing, they first convened a poor farmers' meeting to allow them to boldly raise their difficulties. For example, Fan Mingxiu said: "We four people divided four mu of land, totaling twelve mu. Now we don't have much to eat, and the land we divided is not good, so we didn't harvest much grain this year!" Others said they lacked plows, harnesses, and cattle, among other difficulties. After discussions among the masses, they freely combined based on the availability of farm tools, livestock, and labor, solving the difficulties in production, and the masses were highly motivated. Based on the experience of organizing production mutual aid in Cui＠＠, whenever attention is paid to organizing mutual aid with poor farmers as the mainstay, solving difficulties in production, and truly following the mass line, the enthusiasm of the masses is very high. Conversely, some cadres simply aim to complete the tasks assigned by higher authorities, convening mass meetings in the villages and ordering the masses to establish mutual aid organizations. They repeatedly exhausted the masses with meetings, and later the number of people attending the meetings was very small, and even those who attended remained silent, not daring to express their opinions. For example, the cadres of Lin Zhuang Village subjectively stipulated that several households should form a group, with a certain number of livestock, people, and land in each group. After announcing the arrangements at a mass meeting, the masses had objections, and the goal of rushing to harvest and sow was not achieved.

　　范县三区解决贫雇困难
  　组织收种互助
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】范县三区崔＠＠突击种麦，认真解决贫农困难。在繁重的战勤任务下，崔＠＠组织了十个生产互助组，每十户或十二户为一组，都是自由结合的，鳏寡孤独的十一户、瞎子四户，每组分两户，老头小孩妇女根据劳力的大小，有的算一个工或半个工，大牛为两个工、半大牛算一个半工，小牛算一个工，牲口的草料问题，贫农每亩拿草二十斤、料斤半。有战勤任务时，由各组抽调壮年人，老头小孩妇女半劳力都参加生产。崔＠＠的生产互助是比较好的典型，开始组织时，先召开贫农大会，让贫农大胆的提出自己的困难，如范明修说：“我四人分了四亩地，一共十二亩地。现在就没啥吃了，分的地又不好，今年收的粮食不多！”还有的说没有犁、没有套、没有牛等等困难，经群众酝酿，按农具畜力劳力的有无，自由结合，解决了生产中的困难问题，群众生产情绪都很高。根据崔＠＠组织生产互助的经验，凡注意以贫农为主的组织互助解决生产中的困难，真正走了群众路线，群众情绪就很高。相反的，有的干部单纯为完成上级任务，到村里召开群众大会，命令群众成立互助组织，一次又一次的把群众开疲塌了，后来开会到的人数很少，即是到会的也不哼声，有意见也不敢说。如林庄村干主观规定几家为一组，每组几个牲口、几个人，多少地，大会宣布完事，结果群众有意见，也没达到抢收抢种的目的。
