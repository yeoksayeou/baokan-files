　　“Brigade Commander, Get Up!"
    ——A Record of Wily Capture of Zhang Zhongzhong
    ·Xiao Li·
    During the Changnan Campaign, when Chiang Kai-shek's army's 211th Brigade was bombarded by the Liberation Army from all directions, and each of them fled for their lives, Brigade Commander Zhang Zhongzhong, seeing that his officers and soldiers were laying down their weapons in large numbers and could no longer escape the hands of the Liberation Army, hurriedly hid in a ditch, pretending to be dead. However, Ma Xihe, a soldier from a heavy machine gun company of our unit, captured one of his guards. After Ma Xihe's enthusiastic comfort and explanation, he told Ma the truth:
    "Our brigade commander is hiding in that ditch over there!"
    Upon hearing this, Ma Xihe immediately ran over with his gun. He saw a man lying in the muddy ditch, a foreign-returned type, wearing a good shirt, but already covered in mud, resembling an officer. He shouted loudly:
    "Hey, get up!"
    But Zhang Zhongzhong didn't move. Ma Xihe poked him a few times with his gun, but Zhang Zhongzhong still clenched his teeth, pretending to be dead. Ma Xihe left him and looked around, but there was still no movement. So, he came up with a plan, ran to Zhang Zhongzhong's ear, and whispered:
    "Brigade commander, brigade commander! Get up quickly!"
    Zhang Zhongzhong thought it was one of his own men calling him, and turned over and got up. But when he looked up, he realized he was standing in front of a Liberation Army soldier. He was so frightened that he trembled all over and sat on the ground, refusing to move. Ma Xihe explained to him very sincerely:
    "It doesn't matter that you are a brigade commander. We have plenty of your army commanders and division commanders here, and we treat you well!"
    Zhang Zhongzhong had no choice but to drag his mud-covered body, with a look of surprise and doubt, and followed the Liberation Army soldier Ma Xihe.

　　“旅长，快起来吧”！
    ——智擒张中忠记
    ·萧里·
    昌南之役中，当蒋军二一一旅遭受解放军四面八方轰击，各自逃命之际，旅长张中忠眼看自己部下的官兵大批的放下了武器，已无法逃出解放军之手，就仓惶地钻在一条水沟里装死。但我某部重机枪连战士马西河捉到了他的一名卫士，经过马西河的热情安慰与解释以后，他对马说了实话：
    “我们旅长藏在那边那条水沟里的！”
    马西河听说后立即持枪跑去，看见污泥沟里躺着一个留洋头、穿着好衬衣，但是已经混身泥水的军官模样的人，他就大声叫道：
    “喂，起来吧！”
    但张中忠动也不动，马西河用枪拨了几下，张中忠仍然咬紧牙齿装死。马西河离开他到旁边看看，仍然没有动静，于是想了个计策，跑到张中忠耳朵旁边悄声说：
    “旅长，旅长！快起来吧！”
    张中忠以为是自己人叫他，一转身爬了起来，但抬头一看，原来自己正站在一位解放军战士面前，他吓得浑身发抖，坐在地上不肯走。马西河十分诚恳的向他解释：
    “你是旅长也没有关系，我们这里你们的军长、师长多得很，还优待你们哩！”
    张中忠只好拖着满身泥水，带着惊疑的神情，跟着解放军战士马西河走了。
