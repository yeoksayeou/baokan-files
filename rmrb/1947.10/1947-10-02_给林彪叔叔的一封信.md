　　A Letter to Uncle Lin Biao
　　Dear Uncle:
　　It's been over a year since we parted. Are you doing well in all aspects? Is Aunt doing well too? Are the little brothers and sisters healthy? I'll tell you: my grandfather and the whole family, because of Hu Zongnan's attack in March, were evacuated from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region to ×× Town, × County, Shanxi Province. They are still receiving various preferential treatments from the government in terms of living arrangements, and are safe and sound. My sister, brother, and I also went there with our family and lived in a school there for more than a month. In July, the school we originally attended also crossed the river. Grandfather agreed to my request to go with the school. Since then, we have been living a collective life with the school. Now we have reached our destination and have already started classes. Living conditions are all good, so please don't worry!
　　Thinking back to the situation when we were refugees in the Kuomintang area, when we were surrounded by the Japanese and oppressed by the Kuomintang, my aunt froze to death, and two young sisters starved to death. My dear grandmother and mother were separated from us and died of illness. The old and the young cried, and the family could not be reunited, which makes my heart ache and tears flow....
　　But now it's different, Uncle! We can say that we have arrived in paradise and seen the bright sun. Everything is much better than before. You can imagine how happy I am! My heart is so happy that tears are about to fall from my eyes....
　　Now I am very healthy, growing up in the embrace of the Communist Party, making progress day by day, knowing that I will serve the people in the future, be a new teenager of the Mao Zedong era, avenge my suffering family, and have learned a lot of things and acquired some small skills.
　　Ever since you went to the Northeast to lead the people of the Northeast in their liberation and emancipation movement, I have kept my eyes wide open, always wanting to see the news of victory there. Sure enough, I saw in the newspaper some time ago that battles were often won there. Recently, I heard that you are preparing for a larger-scale counter-offensive to liberate the few cities still ruled by the Kuomintang, such as Shenyang and Changchun. I was extremely happy to learn this! I couldn't help but jump for joy when I walked.
　　Recently, the Liu-Deng army crossed Henan on an expedition, liberating twenty or thirty cities and vast rural areas. The news of these victories filled my ears, and I was even more excited. Now we are going to hold a celebration rally to announce the good news to the people of the whole country. I think: Soon, I will hear the news of your victory. Uncle: You know how happy I will be when I hear that news. I wish the people of all China an early liberation!
　　　　　　　　　And wish you good health!
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Nephew, Cong Ji, September 25th

　　给林彪叔叔的一封信
    从吉叔叔：
    分别一年多了，你各方面都好吗？婶娘也好吗？小弟弟小妹妹们都健康吧？我告诉你：祖父及全家人，因为三月间胡匪宗南的进攻，都从陕甘宁边区，疏散到了山西×县××镇，仍受着政府生活上种种的优待，平安无事，我和姐姐弟弟也随着家里人到过那里，并在那里住过一个多月的学校，七月间我们原先上的学校也过河来了，祖父答应了我和学校一起走的要求，从此以后，我们就跟着学校又过起集体生活来了，现在我们已到了目的地，并已经开始上课，生活条件一切都好，请不要挂念！
    想起以前在国民党地区逃难时的情形，那时被日本包围，国民党压迫，弄得咱家里我婶婶冻死了，两个年幼的妹妹饿死了，亲爱的祖母和妈妈被冲散后病死了。老小哭哭啼啼，一家不能团圆，不禁使我心酸流泪……。
    现在可不一样了，叔叔！我们可说到了天堂，见到光明太阳了，各种各样都比从前好得多了，你想想我该是多么的高兴啊，我心里喜欢得眼里也要掉泪了……。
    如今我很健康，在共产党的怀抱里生长着，一天一天在向前进步着，知道将来要为人民服务，要做毛泽东时代的新少年，为咱受难的家人报仇，还知道了不少事情，学到了些小小的本领。
    自从你去东北，领导东北人民进行解放翻身运动，我就睁大眼睛常想看到那里胜利消息，果然不错，在前些时报上看到那里常打胜仗，最近听说你们又准备作一次更大规模的反攻，解放那还被国民党统治的几个城市象沈阳、长春等，我知道这些后，高兴极了！走路时禁不住要跳着走。
    最近刘邓大军过河南征，解放了二三十个城市，及广大乡村，这些胜利消息传进耳朵里，我更是兴奋呵，现在我们要开庆祝大会，要向全国人民告捷，我想：不久，就会听到你们的胜利消息，叔叔：你知道我听到那些消息会多么高兴呵，祝全中国人民早日解放！
    　　　　　　　　　并祝你身体健康！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　侄儿从吉　九月二十五日
