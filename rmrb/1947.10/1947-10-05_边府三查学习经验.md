　　Bianfu Three Check Learning Experience

　　The Bianfu Three Check learning has been going on for more than three months since mid-June, and now it has come to an end. From everyone checking class and checking ideology to mid-August, learning was slow to progress due to shortcomings in the learning leadership. After Chairman Yang made an enlightening report on thorough learning on August 24, the Learning Committee, based on Chairman Yang’s report and the previous stage of learning, made a review. It was believed that the main problem was that the development of free thinking was not enough, and individual cases adopted the method of "chasing ideology." Some "chased" too hard, and the discussion could not continue. Comrades who were "chased" felt flustered because their thinking could not be resolved for a while. Some comrades talked in their sleep, "Don't chase me, I will turn around and solve the problem." Some comrades were very pessimistic and frustrated because their class background and history were very bad, and they felt that they had no future. Some comrades were also hindered by the fact that their personal lives had specific difficulties that had not been resolved. Some comrades felt that the learning time was too long and expressed boredom. At that time, the thinking of most comrades was that after more than two months of learning, it was clear that some hidden landlords in the organization were evading the struggle. It was necessary to deal with these elements to purify the organization and deepen the learning. However, because the Learning Committee did not promptly understand and grasp these ideological situations, it could not achieve ideological leadership, but instead focused on organizational leadership, which caused a slowdown in learning. Based on this research, it was decided to re-develop free thinking, boldly let go, and say whatever you want, to truly consciously solve the problem. At the same time, a clearing of the organization's air-raid shelters was carried out to prepare for squeezing out feudalism. In the free-thinking process of saying whatever you want, some comrades expressed their opinions and personal difficulties. After discussion, they calmly examined and distinguished right from wrong. For example, some comrades originally believed that the leadership did not take care of family difficulties, but after calculating, it was clear that under the current difficult conditions, the public had indeed done its best to take care of them, while they themselves had unreasonable demands. At this time, the administration also made appropriate solutions for those who really had practical difficulties. After the obstacles were resolved, they turned to examining their thinking, and the learning entered a climax.

　　On September 10, a typical report meeting was held, selecting two comrades with different ideological types. One believed that his father was enlightened in the past, and the other believed that his family should not be involved in the struggle, and his father was a cadre during the eight-year war of resistance. They made demonstration self-criticisms. In addition, the situation of a person from unit ×× who insisted on a stubborn and domineering landlord stance and finally committed suicide was introduced, making a clear comparison between ideological transformation and adherence to the landlord stance. On September 11, the General Affairs Office team automatically detained Cheng @gang, a landlord who was evading the struggle. The next day, the entire organization, together with the villagers, held a struggle meeting. At the struggle meeting, Cheng @gang still attempted to resist stubbornly, arousing everyone's anger. He was beaten severely, and it was finally decided to revoke his job and send him to the masses in his village for handling. This struggle to squeeze out feudalism further clarified class boundaries and defined positions and viewpoints. Each group, based on this struggle, continued to squeeze out feudalism on one hand, and on the other hand, connected it with themselves, re-examined their past thoughts, and further improved themselves ideologically.

　　During the three months of land reform learning, we have gained the following main achievements: The main point is that our position is much clearer than it was three months ago, and our class awareness has been raised. We have recognized ourselves and clarified our class background. Counting only the cadres (excluding miscellaneous personnel). Of the original 54 cadres, excluding those who went to the countryside for work and did not participate in the study, 41 participated in the study. In the class check, 19 people's class status did not change. Three people who originally considered themselves middle peasants were found to be rich peasants, and one was found to be a landlord. One person who originally considered himself a rich peasant was found to be a landlord, two were feudal landlords, one was a bankrupt landlord, and one was a landlord and commercial capitalist. Four people who originally considered themselves landlords were found to be feudal landlords. One person who was originally a landlord was found to be a bureaucratic landlord, and one was a bureaucratic capitalist. Four people who originally considered themselves poor peasants were found to be middle peasants. And one landlord (namely Cheng @gang) was found among those who considered themselves poor peasants. One person who originally considered himself a small merchant was found to be a middle merchant. One person who originally considered himself an ordinary merchant was found to be a commercial capitalist. Of the 41 cadres, 29 were from landlord or rich peasant families. After this check, everyone had the feeling that their current views were very different from what they were three months ago. After learning, the mass viewpoint and organizational viewpoint have been improved. The complaints and grievances against the leadership in the past have been overcome through learning. After ideological reflection, some comrades felt relaxed and happy after their thoughts were clarified, and the relationship between cadres became harmonious and united. The organization has a new atmosphere, work efficiency has improved, the combat style has grown, and they do not bargain when accepting tasks. The camp within the organization has been clarified, and hidden landlords who evaded the struggle have been cleared out (a total of five people have been purged). The relationship with the villagers has also become closer. After struggling against Cheng @gang, each group automatically checked mass discipline and compensated and returned the things to the masses.

　　In the three months of learning, we have also gained the following experiences: 1. Class checking cannot be cleared up in one go, and ideological checking cannot be solved in one go. It must be checked time and time again, and studied three or four times before it can be clarified. In the class check, some were rich peasants in the first check, but landlords in the second check; some had to be overturned in the end and re-discussed to determine the class. In the ideological check, it is necessary to study repeatedly, have time to turn around, and give everyone full consideration. You can't chase or force it, this will not solve the problem; this method sometimes affects the depth of reflection. Be patient and guide and inspire, if it doesn't work once, try again the second time, if it doesn't work temporarily, put it down and discuss others; continue to deepen the reflection from the reflection and inspiration of other comrades. But the real clear understanding comes during actual feudalism squeezing. After squeezing feudalism, ideology deepens, and awareness improves. 2. Start with typical cases, grasp key points, and first solve the more obvious landlord thoughts to open up the situation, and other comrades will also be inspired in the discussion and connect their own understanding of thoughts. If one or two comrades in a group can solve their thoughts, the group's learning will be developed. One or two typical inspirations in each period of the organization can also promote the progress of learning. If every comrade is treated equally and their thoughts must be resolved at the same time, the result will be that the time is prolonged and learning cannot be developed. We made this mistake in the middle of learning, which also caused the slowdown in ideological checking. 3. Learning emotions are high and low, and the movement is also high and low. When it is high, it is of course the normal development of thinking. When it is low, there must be problems; the problems must be checked out and solved in order to continue to make the movement climax. In a period of ideological checking, there were two main problems at that time: One was that some comrades' thoughts were frozen due to the inability to solve specific problems such as family difficulties and personal life difficulties. The other was that after two months of learning, it was necessary to solve the air-raid shelter of the organization to clarify the camp and draw a line. The immediate solution was to solve some specific problems appropriately and to recognize them ideologically. After the obstacles were resolved, the learning was high, and then feudalism squeezing was carried out, and the movement quickly entered a climax. 4. Letting go and ideological leadership: Ideological checking and feudalism squeezing must be let go, and there must be no worries. Thinking that this is a cadre of the eight-year war of resistance, or thinking that if he leaves his job, no one will replace him, etc., is an idea of protecting the landlord. When struggling against Cheng @, we managed to let go, that is, everyone did it. Because he stubbornly resisted, it aroused everyone's hatred, but everyone's request was not to beat him to death here, but to revoke his job and hand him back to his village for handling. This is because the masses in his village have long-term direct rule and exploitation of hatred. To be responsible to the masses, they must be handed back to the villagers for handling, and mobilize the masses to liquidate him. Everyone's speeches and actions at the meeting started from the position and from the masses, which was consistent with the leadership's thinking at the time. From the leadership's point of view, it is the combination of leadership and the masses. We had such a struggle after three months of learning. 5. Transforming ideology and squeezing feudalism: In the three check learning, the landlord elements who evade the struggle should be separated from the cadres. Landlord elements who evade the struggle, whether the family has been liquidated or not, cannot be considered to have completely solved the problem before the review, and should be resolutely purged and sent to the masses for handling. For ordinary cadres, with a long history of work, who have established the concept of serving the people, but are influenced by landlord ideology or have remnants, the basic goal should be to transform their ideology, eliminate the landlord class consciousness, and resolutely stand on the position of serving the peasants in the struggle between landlords and peasants, and serve the masses wholeheartedly. However, there are cadres of various compositions, and worker-peasant cadres should clarify their positions and improve their awareness. Intellectual cadres from landlord and rich peasant families should change their positions, ideologically separate from their feudal families, separate from landlord ideology, cut off their feudal tails, and work as a long-term worker for the masses. Some, although they have a long history of work, have also had alienated emotions for a long time, should resolutely transform, and if family problems are not resolved, they should resolutely stand on the position of the masses and deal with their own problems with the masses. They should resolutely obey the opinions of the masses. If they do not transform, the organization should resolutely and actively hand them over to the masses for handling. (Jiang Dong)

　　边府三查学习经验
    边府三查学习自六月中旬开始到现在三个多月，现已告一段落。自大家常查阶级查思想进行到八月中旬，因学习领导上有缺点，学习呈现迟滞不前。八月二十四日杨主席作了贯澈学习的启发报告之后，学习委员会根据了杨主席的报告，与前一阶段的学习情况，作了一次检查，认为主要是开展自由思想不够，个别的有采用“追思想”的方式，有的“追”顶了，讨论不下去。被“追”的同志因思想一时打不通，感觉追得慌。有的同志晚上说梦话，“不要追了，我回头就回去解决问题”。有的同志因成份历史都很坏，表现了十分悲观懊丧，觉得没有前途。有些同志因自己个人生活上有具体困难没有解决，也障碍了思想的发展。有些同志则认为学习时间太长了，表示厌倦。而当时大部分同志的思想，则是经过了两个多月的学习，对于机关内某些隐藏的逃避斗争的地主分子，已经认识明确，需要对这些分子作处理，使机关纯洁，并将学习深入一步。但因学委会对这些思想情况没有及时了解及时掌握。因此也就不能实现思想领导，却偏重了组织领导，造成了学习上的迟滞现象。根据这一研究，于是决定重新开展自由思想，大胆放手，有啥说啥，以达到真正自觉的解决问题。同时进行清查机关防空洞，准备挤封建。在自由思想有啥说啥中，有的同志将自己的意见和个人的困难都说了出来，又经过讨论，冷静的检查，辨明是非。如有的同志原认为领导上对家属困难不照顾，但一算帐，在目前困难条件下，公家确是做到了最大限度的照顾，而自己则却有不合理的要求。行政上这时对于真有实际困难的，又作了适当的解决。障碍解决后，又转入检查思想，学习走上了高潮。
    九月十日召开了一次典型报告会，选择了两个思想类型的同志，一是认为过去父亲开明；一是认为家庭该不着斗争，父亲又是八年抗战的干部。作了示范反省。另外又介绍了××单位一个坚持顽固恶霸地主立场的人，最后走上自杀的情况，作了一个改造思想与坚持地主立场的明显对照。九月十一日总务处小组自动扣起逃避斗争的地主程＠岗，第二天全机关即联合驻村群众，开斗争大会。斗争大会上，程＠岗还企图顽强抵抗，激起了大家愤怒，将他痛殴一顿，最后决定撤消其工作，送给其本村群众处理。从这一次挤封建斗争中，更划清了阶级界限，明确了立场观点。各小组即根据这一斗争，一面继续挤封建，一面联系自己，将过去思想重新作检查，从思想上把自己再提高一步。
    在三个多月的土改学习中，我们得到了这样几个主要收获：主要一点是立场比三个月以前明确了一大步，阶级认识提高了。认识了自己，查清了阶级成份。光就干部计算（杂务人员未计）。原干部五十四人，除下乡工作未参加学习者外，参加学习的四十一人。查阶级中，成份未变动者十九人。原自认为中农，查出为富农者三人，查出为经营地主者一人。原自认为富农，查出为经营地主者一人，封建地主者二人，破落地主者一人，地主兼商业资本家一人。原自认为经营地主，查出为封建地主者四人。原为地主，查清为官僚地主者一人，官僚资本家一人。原自认为贫农，查清为中农者四人。并在自认为贫农者查出地主一人（即程＠岗）。原自认为小商人，查出为中等商人者一人。原自认为普通商人，查出为商业资本家者一人。四十一个干部，地主富农以上家庭者共二十九人。经过这一查，大家都有这样一个感觉，现在的看法比三个月以前大大不同了。学习后群众观念组织观念提高了。以前对领导上有埋怨牢骚情绪的，经过学习有了克服。经过思想反省，有些同志思想打通后，精神轻松愉快，干部关系融洽团结了。机关内有了新气象，工作效率提高，战斗化作风增长，接受任务不大讲价钱。机关内阵营明确了，隐藏的逃避斗争的地主分子清除了出去（共清洗了五人）。与驻村群众关系也更密切了。斗争程＠岗后，各小组自动检查群众纪律，赔偿与归还群众的东西。
    三个月学习中，我们也得到了这样一些经验：一、查阶级不能一次查清，查思想不能一次解决。要一次一次检查，三翻四复的研究，才能明确。查阶级中，有第一次检查是富农，第二次检查乃是地主；有的到最后还要推翻，再要重新讨论确定阶级。查思想中，要反复研究，要有回旋的时间，给大家充分考虑。不能硬追硬迫，这样不能解决问题；凡用这一方式的，有时反而影响反省的深入。要耐心诱导启发，一次不行，第二次再来，暂时不行，放下另讨论别人；从别的同志的反省启发诱导地继续深入反省。但真正会有比较清楚明确的认识，还是在实际挤封建斗争中才明确。挤封建后，思想深入，觉悟提高。二、从典型入手，抓重点，先解决地主思想比较明显的，打开局面，其他同志也在讨论中得到启发，联系自己认识思想。一个小组中能解决一两个同志的思想，小组的学习就会开展。机关内每一时期有一二个典型启发，也能推动学习的前进。如果每个同志平列的都要同时解决思想，结果时间拉长，学习也不能开展。我们在学习中段，是犯有这一毛病，这也造成查思想中迟滞不前的原因之一。三、学习情绪时高时低，运动也就有高有低，高时当然是思想的正常发展，低时一定存在着有问题；必须将问题检查出来加以解决，才能使运动继续高涨。我们在查思想中一个时期，当时即主要存在着两个问题：一是有些同志思想凝结在家属困难个人生活困难等具体问题的不能解决。一是学习了二个来用，需要解决机关内部的防空洞，以明确阵营，划清界限。当即将一些具体问题适当解决，并从思想上加以认识。障碍解决后，学习即形高涨，接着进行挤封建，运动即很快进入高潮。四、放手与思想领导：查思想挤封建必须放手，不能有任何顾虑，认为这是八年抗战的干部，或者认为走了工作没人替代等等，这是一种掩护地主的思想。在斗争程＠之时，做到了放手，即是大家干。因他顽强抵抗，激起了大家的仇恨，但大家的要求，并不是要在这里加以打死，而是撤消其工作，交回其本村，由群众处理。这是因他本村的群众，有为其长期直接统治剥削的仇恨。要向群众负责，必须交回由本村群众处理，发动群众对他作清算。大家在会上的发言行动，都从立场出发，从群众出发，这是与当时领导思想一致的。从领导上讲，也就是领导与群众结合。我们学习了三个月，才有这样一次斗争。五、改造思想与挤封建：三查学习，应将逃避斗争的地主分子与干部分开。逃避斗争的地主分子，无论家庭已清算或未清算，在没有复查以前，都不能算是彻底解决问题，应该坚决清洗，一律送父群众处理。对于一般干部，有长期工作历史，已树立起为人民服务的观念，但有地主思想影响或残余，基本上应是改造思想，肃清地主阶级意识，在地主与农民之间的斗争中，坚决站在为农民服务的立场上，全心全意为群众服务。但干部有各种不同成份的干部，工农干部应是明确立场，提高觉悟。出身于地主富农家庭的知识分子干部，应该转变立场，从思想上与封建家庭分家，与地主思想分家，割掉封建尾巴，为群众作一个长工。有些虽然有长期工作历史，但也长期存在有异己情绪的，应该坚决转变，家庭有问题未解决，应坚决站在群众立场上，与群众一起，处理自己的问题，自己应该坚决服从群众的意见。如果不转变，机关也应坚决主动的送交给群众，由群众处理。（江东）
