Transmitted by this newspaper from the Jilu Yu area on the 5th:

The District Party Committee Propaganda Team, based on the spirit determined by the August Propaganda and Education Conference regarding communication and reporting work, issued instructions to further improve communication and reporting work. The instructions pointed out the achievements of the past year and the origins of those achievements: Great progress has been made in the past year. Writing movements have been widely carried out in various counties. There are now eight branch offices and forty-nine county stations, as well as forty-seven types of local and county party committee newspapers, which have helped leaders at all levels to gather opinions, experiences, and creations from the grassroots, transmit them to various places, exchange them with each other, and serve the central tasks. Furthermore, thanks to the leadership strengthening the mass viewpoint and the leadership guiding principles of the mass line, the masses were motivated, and these achievements were obtained. However, this movement is still extremely unbalanced. Hereafter, to further implement the mass viewpoint and the mass line and improve communication and reporting work, attention should be paid to the following issues: First, authenticity and accessibility. Everyone who writes must clearly understand that writing is to serve the masses. Examining one's position and ideology is specifically examining and reflecting on one's mass viewpoint. Second, improve quality. Those who have already started writing should pay attention to quality, not just quantity. Write typical examples, pay attention to typical, continuous authenticity, and when writing about achievements, don't just clumsily list numbers, but write about how you reached this point. Leaders should drive and guide correspondents to improve the quality of their manuscripts. Third, combine the universality of workers and peasants with the front lines. In areas where work has already begun, pay attention to going deeper. After land reform, the masses demand cultural emancipation and can combine this with learning to read—using writing-based teaching methods. In addition, north of the Yellow River, quality must be improved, and Henan should also pay attention to this. Party committees at all levels should strengthen the leadership of communication work and newspaper work in the future. Therefore, it is decided that party newspaper committees should be established at all levels to be responsible for political guidance, and the propaganda department will be responsible for day-to-day leadership. If there are not enough personnel in the branch offices and stations, they can be added, along with business research, especially implementing position checks and ideological checks, and implementing the mass viewpoint and the mass line.

　　冀鲁豫区党委指示
  　发展工农通讯注意真实通俗
    【本报冀鲁豫五日电】区党委宣传队根据八月宣教大会关于通讯报导工作确定的精神、发出了进一步提高通讯报导工作的指示。指示中指出一年成绩和成绩的由来：一年来成绩很大，各县的写作运动都普遍开展起来，现已有八个支社，四十九个县站，各地委县委报纸四十七种，帮助了各级领导，从下层集中意见、经验和创造，传达各地，互相交流，为中心工作服务。更由于领导上加强了群众观念，和群众路线的领导方针，群众动了劲来，才取得这些成绩。但此一运动，还极不平衡。此后为进一步贯澈群众观念，群众路线，提高通讯报导工作，应注意以下几个问题：第一、真实与通俗，每个写人都要明确写，是为群众服务，查立场查思想也就是具体检查反省自己的群众观念。第二、提高质量。已经写起来的人，要注意质量，不要只写多，要写典型，注意典型连续真实，写成绩不是笨拙的光罗列数目字，要是写怎样到达这一步的。领导上要带动与指导通讯员提高稿件质量。第三、普遍农工与前方结合，已开展地方，注意深入。土改以后，群众要求文化翻身，可以和学识字——用写话的教学法相结合。另外黄河以北，更要提高质量，河南还应重视之。各级党委今后要加强通讯工作和报纸工作的领导，因此决定各级要建立党报委员会，负责政治方针上领导，宣传部负责日常的领导。各支社各站人员不足，可加添，加上业务研究、特别贯彻查立查思想，贯彻群众观念群众路线。
