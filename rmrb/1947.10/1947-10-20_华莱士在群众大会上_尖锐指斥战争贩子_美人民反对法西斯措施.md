Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Reports from various sources: The policies of the American warlords and Wall Street to "dominate the world" have become the subject of unanimous criticism at the mass meetings of various American mass organizations. At a mass meeting of more than 8,000 people hosted by the American Progressive Citizens Association in Baltimore on the evening of the 15th, and at a subsequent press conference, Wallace sharply denounced U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal as the head of the warmongering clique in Washington; and said that Forrestal, along with Secretary of Commerce Harriman and Undersecretary of State Lovett, formed a "control company" of Wall Street bankers. Wallace declared: "Forrestal and his Wall Street dynasty are emerging to attempt to dominate the world. They demand huge defense expenditures because their profits depend on the size of the army and navy orders." Senator Taylor, at a Oregon Federation of Labor meeting in Portland, vehemently attacked the U.S. foreign policy of "supporting reactionary forces around the world." Taylor rebuked the U.S. State Department for being subservient to the military and Wall Street. He also stated that the governments supported by American reactionaries are "paper tiger governments" and cannot represent the people. Senator Pepper, at a banquet of the "American Slav Congress" on the 12th, also criticized the U.S.'s betrayal of the Potsdam Agreement and its imperialist policy of rebuilding Germany, and demanded that Americans remove the reactionary elements in Congress and the government and replace them with progressive and truly democratic forces.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. New York dispatch: The U.S. "Civil Rights Congress" recently convened a conference here. The conference was attended by 300 representatives of writers, artists, trade unions, and progressive organizations. The conference decided to demand that the House of Representatives disband the House "Un-American Activities Investigation Committee" (previously translated as the House "Committee to Investigate Actions Violating American Interests"), because the committee is an enemy of democracy and the United States, "suppressing progressive forces and protecting fascists." The conference also demanded the repeal of the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law and demanded that Truman revoke his so-called "loyalty order."

    【新华社陕北十八日电】各方讯：美国军阀及华尔街“统治世界”的政策，在美国各群众团体的大会上，成为一致抨击的主题。华莱士十五日晚在巴尔的摩美进步公民协会所主持的八千余人群众大会及会后之招待记者中，尖锐地指斥美国防部长福莱斯特为华盛顿好战集团的头子；并称：福氏与商务部长哈立曼及副国务卿罗维持，形成了华尔街银行家的“控制公司”。华氏宣称：“福氏及其华尔街皇朝，正出而企图统治世界，他们要求庞大的国防经费，因为他们的利润仰赖于陆海军定货的大小。”参议员泰勒于奥勒冈州波特甘产联会议上猛烈攻击美国“支持全世界反动势力”之外交政策。泰氏斥责美国务院之隶属于军人及华尔街。并称：美国反动派所支持的政府是“纸糊的政府”，不能代表人民。参议员泼贝尔十二日在“美国斯拉夫人大会”宴会上，亦抨击美国之背叛波茨顿协定及重建德国的帝国主义政策，并要求美人扫除国会及政府中之反动分子，而代以进步与真正民主之力量。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】纽约讯：美“维护人权大会”顷在此间召开大会。会议到有作家、艺术家、职工会与进步团体之代表三百人，大会决定要求众院解散众院“非美活动调查委员会”，（前曾译为众院“违反美国利益行动调查委员会”）因为该委员会为民主及美国之敌人，“镇压进步势力，袒护法西斯。”大会同时要求废除塔虎脱——哈特莱反劳工法，要求杜鲁门撤消其所谓“忠诚令”。
