　　Strive for a Good Harvest Next Year by Eliminating Wasteland and Expanding Wheat Planting
　　Masses in the First District of Southern Hebei Actively Reclaim Land
　　[From our newspaper in Southern Hebei, 30th] The First District is actively reclaiming wasteland to expand the wheat planting area and strive for a good harvest next year. In Qiu County, the Fourth District, Zhengzhuang in Linqing's Seventh District, the Second Sub-district of the Eighth District, Qiandong Village in Yuanchao's First District, Niantou Village in the Fifth District, and Lizhuang and other places in Guan County's Sixth District, a total of 3,972 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed one after another. In Matou Village in Qiu County's Fourth District, 533 mu of virgin land have been reclaimed. Together with villages such as Huoxinzhuang, Mengjie, and Damingzhuang, a total of 1,680 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed. The masses in Matou said, "The wheat we harvest from this wasteland next year will be enough for all of us in the village to eat for two months." Sun Xingjia and Sun Defeng, labor heroes in Xiaotun in the First District, reclaimed 20 mu of wasteland in ten days after buying an ox together. Under their call, the whole village reclaimed a total of 158 mu of land. In the Second Sub-district of Linqing's Ninth District, cadres and the masses competed in reclaiming wasteland. Eleven villages, including Xiduan Village and Dumatang, reclaimed a total of 149 mu of virgin land and 275 mu of cultivated wasteland, and eliminated 1,101 mu of alkaline land. In Zhengzhuang, in the Third District, the village cadres took the lead in organizing wasteland investigation teams, finding a total of 300 mu of wasteland, of which 154 mu have now been eliminated. Niantou Village in Yuanchao's Fifth District seized the gaps in the busy autumn season to actively reclaim wasteland. Village Chief Deng Yinwu, Martial Arts Director Zhao Hongquan, and Instructor Zhao Hongzi personally took the lead, reclaiming 41 mu of wasteland. Of the 140 mu of wasteland in the whole village, 83 mu have been reclaimed. Sun Jiyun, the director of the Farmers' Association in Jizhuang in Guan County's Sixth District, led the masses in the whole village to reclaim 300 mu of wasteland in one month. Furthermore, a county-wide meeting of district and village cadres was held in Feixiang on the second of this month to discuss wasteland reclamation and wheat planting. The first, second, and fifth districts have a total of more than 9,000 mu of wasteland. Everyone firmly stated that they would turn this wasteland into wheat fields. At a yield of two dou per mu, 1,800 shi of wheat can be harvested next year. Villages are actively mobilizing to launch shock reclamation efforts.
　　[From our newspaper] The masses in Lingchuan are currently carrying out a vigorous campaign to reclaim wasteland and plant wheat. Some villages have never planted wheat before, but this year they are preparing to plant wheat to prepare for famine. For example, Yun’gutu Village has never planted wheat. In this year’s “Save and Prepare for Famine” campaign, the masses in the whole village discussed that in addition to hoarding some bran and vegetables, they should break with old habits and plant wheat. Mutual Aid Group leaders Li Erwen and Wang Laiqiu proposed, "We must be determined to plant more wheat to help next year, and we cannot rely solely on the autumn harvest." This was immediately supported by the masses, and each household made a wheat planting plan. In addition to planting all the cultivated wasteland, the whole village also reclaimed 22.8 mu of virgin land. The masses in Yangzhai Village launched a merit-making competition in the large-scale reclamation of wasteland and planting of wheat, and decided to make a large red flag, with a summary every seven days. The group that reclaims and plants the most wheat will win the flag. In this way, all the mutual aid groups in the village were involved in the wasteland reclamation and wheat planting campaign. There are a total of 265 laborers in the village. With 145 people used for war and production, only 120 people (full and half) participated in wheat planting. The original plan was to reclaim 314 mu of wasteland, but with only half the number of people, 350 mu of wasteland were reclaimed in just seven days, exceeding the plan by 36 mu. Preparations are now being made for fertilizer to be sown, and there are plans to continue reclaiming wasteland. (New Life Daily)
　　[From our newspaper in Jincheng] In Jincheng Chengguan, citizens who are peddlers, transporters, and handicraft workers account for almost 80% of the total population. They regard farming as the "least worthwhile" activity, so much of the land is barren. Dong Street alone has more than 67 mu of wasteland. The district called on everyone to eliminate all virgin and cultivated wasteland this year, eliminate wasteland, plant more wheat, support the front line to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, and strive to plant six-tenths of the wheat fields to eight-tenths. After the wheat harvest in May next year, corn and black beans can also be planted, turning one season of harvest a year into two seasons of harvest a year. After the meeting, the masses themselves brewed and proposed: "Eat enough, plant wheat early." Xiao Tutou, chairman of the Farmers' Association, said: "We city people 'look down on' farming, so we don't have enough grain for half a year and have to buy rice and flour. If we can turn the land from one season to two seasons, I think our Dong Street's food will be almost enough. Then we can invest the surplus profit from doing small business in the road to reproduction, so that every household will have surplus grain." A farmer named Heshang from Beichenggen said: "Get rich with business, support the family with land." Everyone unanimously recognized the benefits of farming. After the meeting, Qin Laoer wanted to plant the land on Nancheng. In recent days, men and women, old and young, in Dong Street have been going to the countryside to plant wheat. Also, Jia Guiying, a woman from Miao Xiang, personally went to the field to pull two mu of grass to plant wheat because there were no laborers in her family. Many people said: "In previous years, Chengguan planted six-tenths of wheat, but this year we must plant eight-tenths of the damned land."

　　争取明年多收灭荒扩大种麦
  　冀南一专区群众积极开荒
    【本报冀南卅日电】一专区积极开荒，扩大种麦面积，争取明年多收。邱县四区，临清七区郑庄、八区二小区，元朝一区前东村、五区念头村，冠县六区李庄等地，先后共开荒土地三千九百七十二亩。邱县四区马头一村开生荒五百卅三亩，加上霍辛庄、孟街、大名庄等村，共开荒一千六百八十亩，马头群众说：“咱开这些荒，明年收了麦子，够咱全村老少吃两个月。”一区小屯劳英孙兴甲与孙德凤，伙买牛后，十天开荒二十亩，在他们号召下，全村共开荒地一百五十八亩。临清九区二小区干、群竞赛开荒，西段村、大马堂等十一村共开生荒一百四十九亩、熟荒二百七十五亩，消灭硷地一千一百零一亩。三区郑庄以村干为主，组织了查荒组，共查出荒地三百亩，现已消灭一百五十四亩。元朝五区念头村抓紧秋忙空隙，积极开荒，村长邓印武、武会主任赵洪全、指导员赵洪子亲自带头，开荒四十一亩，全村一百四十亩荒地，已开起八十三亩。冠县六区冀庄农会主任孙吉运，领导全村群众，一月开荒三百亩。又：肥乡本月二日全县区村干部集会，讨论开荒种麦，统治一、二、五三个区，共有荒地九千多亩，大家坚决表示要把这些荒地变成麦田，每亩按二斗收成，明年可多收麦子一千八百石，各村正纷纷动员突击开荒。
    【本报讯】陵川群众目前正在开展热火朝天的开荒种麦运动，有些村子历来就没种过麦，今年也准备种麦备荒。如云谷图村向来就没种过麦，在今年“节约备荒”运动中，全村群众讨论除囤集些糠菜外，要打破旧习惯，种麦子。互助组长李二文、王来秋提出：“咱们要下决心多种小麦，来接济明年，不能死靠一季秋了。”当即得到群众拥护，各家都订了种麦计划。全村除把所有熟荒种完外，还开生荒二十二亩八分。杨寨村群众在大量开荒种麦中开展了立功竞赛，决定作一面大红旗，七天一总结，那组开荒种麦多，就夺旗，这样一来，全村互助组都卷入了开荒种麦运动。该村共有劳力二百六十五人，除参战搞生产用去一百四十五人外，只有一百二十人（全半）参加种麦，原计划开荒三百十四亩，就此一半人数，在短短七天中，就开了三百五十亩荒地，超过计划三十六亩，现正在搞粪准备下种，并计划继续开荒。（新生报）
    【本报晋城讯】晋城城关市民做摊贩、捣运输、作手工业的几乎占全人口总数百分之八十强；把种地看成了是“最不上算”的活，因此土地多荒芜，只东街一街就有荒地六十七亩多，区上号召今年要把生熟荒消灭干净，消灭荒地多种麦，支援前线打倒蒋介石，六成麦地争取种到八成，明年五月麦毕还能种玉茭和黑豆，一年一季收成，变成为一年两季收成，会后由群众自己酝酿，提出：“饭要吃饱，麦要种早”，农会主席小秃说：“我们城里人，因对种地‘看不上眼’粮食就有半年不够吃用，买米买面；咱们如果能把地来变一季为两季，我想咱东街食粮，就差不多够吃了，那咱做小买卖余下的利钱，投到再生产的路上，就做到户户有余粮了”，北城根后农民名叫和尚说：“发财生意，养家土地”，大家一致认识种地好处，会后秦老二，就想种南城上的地。在最近几天，东街男女老少，纷纷下乡种麦。又，庙巷妇女贾桂英，因为家中没有劳力，亲自下地拔了二亩草要种上麦，许多群众说：“往年城关种麦六成，今年非种他狗日的八成不行”。
