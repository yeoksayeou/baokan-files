Cooperative Hero Li Jiakui Leads the Whole Village
　　Helping Military Families and Veterans Accumulate Fertilizer and Expand Wheat Planting
    [Our newspaper, Licheng News] During the expansion of wheat fields in Beiliu this year, most of the masses lacked fertilizer, especially military cadres and families of martyrs, veterans, and newly turned-over farmers. Cooperative hero Li Jiakui proposed that the cooperative had a stock of flower seeds. Oil should be pressed out of them and the oil cakes should be used to help poor military cadres, families of martyrs, veterans, and newly turned-over farmers solve the fertilizer problem and expand their wheat fields. Village cadres agreed. Jiakui organized the oil press to press the flowers. Civilian labor was organized to survey the village and found that there were a total of 44 military cadres, families of martyrs, and veterans. After discussion, it was determined that 27 households should be helped, requiring a total of 3,100 catties of flower seeds. For example, 11 households including Liu Mantian and others, collectively improved more than 30 mu of wheat fields, and were helped with 1,600 catties of flower seeds. Eighteen newly turned-over farmers collectively improved 25.5 mu of wheat fields, and were helped with more than 2,000 catties of flower seeds. In total, 38 households of military cadres, families of martyrs, veterans, and newly turned-over farmers were helped to improve 61 mu of wheat fields.
    After this assistance, the masses, military cadres, families of martyrs, and veterans were all very happy. This not only saved labor, but also completed the task of improving wheat fields, freeing up labor and livestock, so that they can harvest the stubble fields earlier during the autumn harvest.

    [Our newspaper, Lincheng News] In Qijiazhuang, three large teams were organized during the autumn harvest and wheat planting, and four night-time autumn carrying teams (within the three large teams). Men and women divided the work, with men cultivating and women harvesting. Women harvest during the day without using livestock, and each person is guaranteed to plant 2.5 mu of wheat. Priority is given to helping families of soldiers with harvesting and cultivation. Each person harvests 100 catties of wild vegetables, and no wine, meat, or mooncakes are bought for the Mid-Autumn Festival. Starting on the 26th, the men, led by the village cadres, voluntarily carried crops for the military families, carrying for 12 military families' 41 mu of land in one night. (Shi Ying)
