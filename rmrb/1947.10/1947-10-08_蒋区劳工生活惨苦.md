Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: According to news from the Northeast and Chahar: Under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the lives of employees in Benxi Lake, Northeast, and workers on the Ping Sui Railway are becoming increasingly miserable, and they have recently been subjected to massive layoffs. The original Benxi Lake Chiang Kai-shek Coal and Iron Company had more than 10,000 employees, but recently only 3,600 remain. Workers are forced to work 12 hours a day, and the wages they receive can only be exchanged for just over a catty of sorghum rice. Coupled with repeated deductions and arrears, employees are unable to maintain even the most basic living standards. However, the factory is engaged in large-scale exploitation, embezzling the workers' hard-earned money for its own enjoyment. The general manager of the company, Zhang Songling, spends more than 200,000 yuan on food alone each day, which is about the daily wage of more than 500 employees. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities on the Ping Sui Railway have been laying off employees since April. In Zhangjiakou's Dachan and the machinery section, and the vehicle inspection personnel, about 400 people have been laid off. At other stations and supervisor offices, an average of five or six out of 20 people have been laid off, and the Zhangjiakou police force has been completely replaced by the Chiang Kai-shek special agent system's "traffic police team." A large number of unemployed workers have successively fallen into miserable living conditions. Some rely on small businesses to temporarily make a living, while others have fled outside the city to find other ways out. The lives of employed workers who have not been dismissed are also equally difficult. According to the current grain prices, the extremely low wages earned by each person per month, after deducting the "membership fee" according to the "28%" system, plus the forced "treating and gift-giving," are difficult to maintain even for one person's living expenses, let alone taking care of the family. The workers said in their letters: "When our people's forces (referring to Zhangjiakou being taken by the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit army from the previous democratic government) come, we will settle the old scores with them (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang)."

　　蒋区劳工生活惨苦
    【新华社陕北四日电】据东北及察哈尔消息：在蒋家匪帮统治下，东北本溪湖员工，及平绥铁路工人生活惨苦日甚，近更被大量裁减。本溪湖蒋家煤铁公司原有员工万余人，而最近只剩三千六百人。工人每日被迫工作十二小时，所得工资仅能换得斤余高粱米，加之一再克扣拖欠，员工均无法维持最低生活。而厂方则大肆剥削，侵吞工人血汗钱，供其享受。该公司总经理张松龄每天仅伙食费一项即达二十余万元，约为五百余人的每日工资。平绥路蒋匪当局自四月份以来，即行裁员，仅张家口大厂及机务股和检车人员等，被裁者即达四百人左右，其他各站监工处，在二十人中平均有五六人被裁，且张家口警务股又全由蒋匪特务系统的“交警队”代替。大量失业工人均相继陷入生活惨境，有些依靠小买卖暂时糊口，有些已逃出市外，另谋出路，未被开除的在职工人生活，亦同样困迫，按目前粮价计算，每人每月所得极低工资，除去按“二八”扣掉“会费”，再加上被迫的“请客送礼”，连一个人的生活也难维持，家口更难照顾。工人们信中说：“等咱们的天系指张市被蒋傅匪军（前民主政权）来了，清算他们（指蒋家匪帮）老帐。
