　　On the American Bourgeoisie and Foreign Policy
　　Chairman of the American Communist Party Foster
　　　　What is the Purpose of the Marshall Plan?
Now we have the so-called "Marshall Plan," which aims to further the Truman Doctrine, and if possible, to create a large loan plan for the whole of Europe, so that the democratic people can be more accepting of the Truman Doctrine. According to this plan, the US government will inevitably spend billions of dollars on European governments. Obviously, if Wall Street succeeds, this plan will only become another more effective way for the reactionaries to打击打击 the democratic forces. Such a grand financial aid plan should be planned and supported by strong political leaders. This fact itself shows that within the bourgeoisie camp, there is a deep feeling that the US imperialist policies currently being pursued in Europe are unsuccessful and must be greatly strengthened. Behind this view lies a great fear of the stability of European capitalism. The Marshall Plan hopes for a plan to economically and politically subordinate the entire Europe to the United States. This has been made very clear by the statements of those who support this plan. Behind this plan also lurks Churchill's reactionary plan to establish an anti-Soviet Western European group, the so-called "European Federation." This is a conspiracy to divide the world into two armed and hostile camps. Of course, our party supports financial loans, but these loans must be given to the impoverished democratic countries of Europe, and the more such loans the better. Perhaps our party should formulate a massive aid program for Europe, in which the main part must be to resolutely oppose the reactionary political conditions attached to the loans by Wall Street imperialists, and insist that these loans must conform to the interests of the European and American people. We must recognize that the so-called Marshall Plan is not a substitute for the reactionary Truman Doctrine, but rather its expansion and reinforcement. The outcome of the Marshall Plan will depend on how the European people resist the political terms imposed on them by Wall Street for financial assistance. This war-mongering foreign policy of American imperialism is mainly for the following purposes: First, it is a weapon to extort economic and political concessions from weak countries, and also a weapon to reduce weak countries to the status of American dependencies; Second, it is a way to strengthen the reactionary forces in Europe, giving them some hope for their expected US-Soviet war; Third, the atmosphere of war created by this ideological terror at home is actually a smokescreen, used to implement the reactionary policies and fascism of the big bourgeoisie at home; Fourth, this planned war terror creates a seemingly good excuse for the unprecedentedly huge peacetime military spending of 16 billion yuan maintained by the United States.
　　　　War Crisis Not to Be Ignored
Behind all these immediate goals of the American warmongers, there is in fact a real war crisis. Therefore, it is obvious that the Truman Doctrine, which supports the reactionary parties of various countries in fighting civil wars, is a threat to world peace. For example, if a civil war breaks out in France or Italy, this crisis, which is actually due to the intervention and sabotage of American imperialism, may very well escalate into an international war tragedy. When the world's strongest capitalist country is frantically strengthening its armaments, as the United States is doing today, while at the same time conducting diplomatic, economic, and propaganda offensives against the Soviet Union, and is accompanied by increasingly undisguised military threats, a real war crisis exists under such circumstances. From all this, it would be too foolish for us to ignore the existence of this actual war crisis. Neglecting this crisis would be a disastrous ostrich policy. The only conclusion we can draw from this whole situation is that if it is not resisted, Truman's foreign policy will lead to war. Therefore, we treat it as a war policy and fight it. When deciding the degree of depth of this existing war crisis, we must never reduce it to a theoretical abstraction, nor should we portray it as making people feel that war is imminent. We must especially oppose all ideas that war is inevitable.
　　　　Analysis of the Bourgeoisie
For the current situation, we must make a prudent Marxist analysis, and dialectically weigh all the factors that support and oppose war. In this analysis, there is one argument that has been neglected by us all along, that is, to analyze the composition of the bourgeoisie in foreign policy, and the social forces attached to it. This analysis is fundamentally necessary, because since the bourgeoisie is the ruling class today, their words and deeds and policies have a decisive importance in the current issue of war and peace. On this point, I would like to reiterate that the most important point in Browder's (former Chairman of the American Communist Party, who was expelled from the party in 1945 for implementing opportunist policies that caused serious errors - translator) reformism was that they made a serious error in their estimation of the composition of the American bourgeoisie. He saw the extreme right wing, and he also saw the Roosevelt faction, but he did not see the most important faction in the class that existed between these two extremes. He also made the ridiculous mistake of dividing the main part of financial capital into the Roosevelt faction. This unprincipled statement completely undermined all his estimations. Therefore, when we analyze the situation of the bourgeoisie today, we must never make such a mistake again, neither being right nor left.
　　　　Three Major Groups in Foreign Policy
On the issue of foreign affairs, the American bourgeoisie can be roughly divided into three groups: The first is the absolutely warmongering group. In the bourgeoisie camp, it is a minority. Among them are both Republicans and Democrats. This warmongering group is composed of the most fascist elements in the country. Their central idea is: they believe that only after the Soviet Union is militarily defeated can the American imperialist peace be tightly integrated with the whole world. The representatives of these warmongers are the likes of Hearst, Patterson, McCormick (the above three are all the most reactionary newspaper magnates in the United States, who control hundreds of newspapers, radio stations, magazines and news agencies throughout the United States, so most of the public opinion in the United States is influenced and controlled by them - translator), Bullitt, Earl, MacArthur and other figures. They believe that war against the Soviet Union is inevitable, and the sooner the better. They fill our newspapers and broadcasts with crazy war propaganda. They are almost all openly advocating a "preventive" war against the Soviet Union. They demand that, as they say, they use atomic energy to deal with the Soviet Union while the United States still monopolizes it. They are extreme militarists and barbaric supporters of the "tough on the Soviet Union" policy. They are now demanding a policy of rupture with the Soviet Union. Many top labor leaders, such as Matthew Woll (Vice President of the "American Federation of Labor", one of the most reactionary labor leaders - translator) and Dubinsky (Chairman of the "International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union", one of the most reactionary union leaders - translator) must be included in this absolutely warmongering faction. Also, the right-wing Social Democrats, the communist traitors, and some prominent Catholic priests also belong to this warmongering group.
　　　　Hesitant Capitalists
The second group is the most powerful group in the American bourgeoisie. They have very contradictory concepts about what route American foreign policy should take, especially on the issue of war. With considerable reservations, they mainly believe that a war against the Soviet Union may be inevitable. In a general direction, they support the "tough on the Soviet Union" policy. They support the Truman Doctrine, which adopts direct intervention against the democratic forces of various countries; At the same time, they are also loyal supporters of the current so-called "bipartisan foreign policy," which involves obscuring the hoarding of grain and imposing financial loans with reactionary political conditions on war-torn countries. They support large-scale anti-Soviet propaganda and government military plans, including the three major anti-Soviet air force outposts being built far in the Arctic through the Japanese islands and the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and the establishment of war bases around the world. Although there is a prospect of war in front of it, this most powerful and decisive group in the bourgeoisie becomes hesitant as it approaches the actual issue of war. These capitalists understand that spreading too much power is absolutely not suitable for launching another war. Therefore, they are troubled by many doubts and fears. Many of them are hesitant about the future of the Truman Doctrine. Many people are hesitant about the huge funds needed to plan the Marshall Plan, and advocate the abolition of the reactionary political conditions for this assistance. At the same time, they also doubt the effect of the atomic bomb as a decisive military weapon. They fear that Britain will not participate in the anti-Soviet war. They are alarmed by the anti-war psychology of the European people, especially the anti-war spirit of the American people. They fear the strength of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries. They hold a doubtful attitude as to whether they can defeat the Soviet Union, and they fear that such a war may instead lead to the entire end of capitalism and the victory of socialism throughout the world. Therefore, they feel shaken and hesitant about the policy of truly going to war. Due to the contradictory relationship between the Democratic and Republican parties, these contradictions and hesitations in this vast bourgeoisie are even more serious. Sometimes this largest group of bourgeoisie tends towards the openly pro-war faction, dangerously strengthening anti-Soviet and anti-democratic policies. For example, the policy of the United States unilaterally concluding a treaty with Germany advocated in the Hoover Proposal. But on the other hand, they still have lingering hopes, hoping to deceive the Soviet Union and other parts of the world with their imperialist peace without war and through negotiations. Their leaders in the government even occasionally reach some agreements with the Soviet Union on certain important issues, although this is achieved with a lot of pain, which indicates that some disputes are possible regarding the issue of the upcoming November Foreign Ministers' Conference. The agents of this decisive bourgeois group are the likes of Hoover, Vandenberg, Truman, Marshall, Luce, Dewey, and Connally. This group is the main group that formulates the current US foreign policy. Most top labor leaders follow the line of this group in international policy.
　　　　A Faction Deeply Supported by the People
The third group is also a minority in the bourgeoisie, among which there are outstanding spokesmen like Wallace. This is the remnant of the Roosevelt part of the bourgeoisie, which represents mostly the smaller bourgeoisie, among which there are few large financial capitalists (if any). This group follows the line of international peace, advocating friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union and the unity of the three powers. This group has few reinforcements in the bourgeoisie, but it has the solid support of lower-level trade union cadres and the broad masses of the people.

　　论美国资产阶级与外交政策
    美共主席  福斯特
    　　　　马歇尔计划目的何在？
    现在我们有了所谓“马歇尔计划”，这计划的目的是想进一步进行杜鲁门主义，而且如果可能的话，以对整个欧洲创作一个大贷款的计划，好让民主的人民对杜鲁门主义可以接受一点。依照这一个计划，美国政府势必将以数十亿元的金元化在欧洲各国政府身上。很明显的，如果华尔街得心应手的作下去的话，这个计划只会成为反动派更有效的打击民主力量的另一条道路。象这样宏大的一个财政援助计划，应由强有力的政治领袖所策划与支持。这事实本身即说明了：在资产阶级阵营里深深的感到目前在欧洲所推行的美帝国主义政策是不成功的，必须予以大大的加强。在这看法的后面，也蕴藏着对于欧洲资本主义的稳定性所怀的极大的恐惧。马歇尔计划希望要一个在经济和政治上把整个欧洲依附于美国的方案，这已经为支持这计划者的言论说得很清楚了。在这计划的背后，同时也潜藏着建立反苏西欧集团所谓“欧洲联邦”的邱吉尔反动计划。这是一种阴谋，企图把世界分裂为两个武装敌对的阵营。当然，我们党是支持财政贷款的，然而这贷款必须是给予欧洲贫困的民主国家，而且这样的贷款越多越好，或许我们党应当制成一个庞大的援欧方案，在这个方案里，主要的部分必须是坚决反对华尔街帝国主义者对于贷款所附加的反动政治条件，并坚持这些贷款必需符合欧洲及美国人民的利益。我们必须认清所谓马歇尔计划，并不是反动的杜鲁门主义的一个替身，而是他的扩大和援军。马歇尔计划的结果如何，将决定于欧洲人民对于华尔街为财政援助，所加于他们的政治条款的抵抗如何。美帝国主义的这种叫嚣战争的外交政策，主要的是为了以下几个目的：第一、这是骗取弱国在经济和政治上让步的一个武器，同时也是使弱国降为美国附庸地位的一个武器；第二、这是加强欧洲反动力量的一个方式，对他们期待中的美苏之战给予一些希望；第三、这种已造成国内意识上的恐怖现象来形成的好战气氛，实际上是一种烟幕，利用他来在国内施行大资产阶级的反动政策和法西斯主义；第四、这种有计划性制造出来的战争恐怖，对美国目前所维持每年一百六亿的空前庞大的平时军费，造成了一个似是而非的好借口。
    　　　　不容忽视的战争危机
    在美国好战分子所有这些眼前目标的背后，事实上却存在着一个真正的战争危机，所以很明显的，支持各国反动派打内战的杜鲁门主义，对于世界和平是一个威胁。比如如果在法国或意大利发生内战，实际上因为美帝国主义的干涉和破坏，这个危机是存在的，很可能就扩大为一个国际性战争的悲剧。当全世界最强的资本主义国家在狂热的加强武装，就如同美国今天的作法，同时还针对苏联进行外交上的经济上的和宣传上的攻势，并且配合着日益无庸掩饰的军事威胁，在这种情形之下一个真正的战争危机是存在的。从所有这些看来，如果忽视这个实际战争的危机的存在，那我们就太愚蠢了。对这危机的忽视，将是导向灾难的驼鸟政策。从这整个局面我们所能得出唯一的一个结论，就是如果不加以抵制的话，杜鲁门的外交政策将走向战争。因此，我们把它当做一个战争的政策来与他决斗。再在决定这个存在战争危机的程度深浅时，我们决不能把他降低到一种理论化的抽象观念，同样我们也不应该把他描绘成使人觉得战争迫在眉睫，我们必须特别的反对一切认为战争不可避免的思想。
    　　　　对资产阶级的分析
    对于当前的局势，我们必须做一个持重的马克思观点的分析，辩证的衡量一下所有拥护和反对战争的因素。在这个分析当中，有一个一直为我们所忽视的论点，那就是分析资产阶级在外交政策上的组合，以及与其相依附的社会力量。这个分析是基本上所必要的，因为既然资产阶级在今天是统治阶级，他们的言行和政策，在当前的战争与和平问题上，就有着决定的重要性。在这一点上，我愿重提一下，在白劳德（前美共主席因实行机会主义政策造成严重错误，而于一九四五年被开除党籍——译者）的改良主义里最重要的一点，就是他们对美国资产阶级的组合的估计，犯了严重错误。他看见了极右派，他也看见了罗斯福的一派，但是他却没有看见生存于这两个极端之间的阶级中最主要的一派。也曾经犯过可笑的错误，竟把财政资本的主要部分划分在罗斯福这一派里，这个违背原则的说法，就完全破坏他的一切估计。所以我们在今天分析资产阶级的形势时，就决不能再犯象这样的错误，既然不右又不能左。
    　　　　外交政策上的三大集团
    在外交问题上，粗略地说，美国的资产阶级可以分成三个集团：第一个是绝对的好战集团。在资产阶级阵营里，它是一个少数派，他们当中既有共和党，又有民主党，这一个好战的集团，是由国内最法西斯的分子所组成。他们的中心思想是：他们相信只有苏联在军事上被击溃了以后，美国帝国主义式的和平才能够紧紧的与全世界相结合。这些好战分子的代表，就是赫斯特之流、柏特逊之流、麦考米克之流（以上三人，均为美国最反动的报阀，在他们手里掌握全美数百家报纸、广播电台、杂志和通讯社，所以美国大部分的舆论都受他们的影响，在他们的控制之下——译者），布立特之流（布立特为最反动头子之一，曾任美驻苏驻法大使，七八月间曾来华，代表“生活”及“时代”杂志作长期调查回美后，鼓吹以十三亿五千万美元援蒋内战——编者），依尔之流，麦克阿瑟之流等等人物。他们认为对苏作战是不可避免的，而且愈早愈好。他们以疯狂的好战宣传，充斥于我们的报纸和广播中。他们差不多都是公开主持对苏进行“预防性”战争的分子。他们要求如他们所说的趁美国还独占着原子能的时候，即行使用它来对付苏联。他们都是极端军国主义者以及“对苏强硬”政策的蛮横的拥护者。他们现在正要求实行对苏破裂的政策。许多劳工上层领袖，诸如马修乌尔（为“美国劳工联合会”副主席，最反动劳工领袖之一—译者）及杜宾斯基（为美国“国际妇女服装工人联合会”主席，为最反动工会领袖之一——译者）都必须列入这个绝对好战派里。同样应当列入这派的，还有右翼的社会民主党员、叛党的共产党员，一些著名的天主教派牧师，也是属于这个好战集团的。
    　　　　傍徨不定的资本家
    第二个集团是美国资产阶级中最强大的一个集团，他们对于美国外交政策应走什么路线，特别是对于战争的问题有着非常矛盾的概念。在相当的保留之下，主要的他们相信对苏一战，或许是不可避免的。在一般方向上，他们拥护“对苏强硬”政策，他们支持采取直接干涉方式反对各国民主力量的杜鲁门主义；同时他们也是目前所谓——“两党外交政策”的忠诚拥护者，而这种外交政策所做的，是蒙混粮食的贮额，以及将带有反动政治条件的财政贷款加诸于为战争所蹂躏了的国家。他们支持大规模的反苏宣传，以及政府的军事计划，包括远在北极通过日本岛屿和地中海、中东一带正在建造中的三大反苏空军前哨站，以及在全世界建立战争的基地等等。虽然在它的面前有一个战争的远景，然而这个资产阶级中最强大的而且最起决定作用的集团，一接近到实际的战争问题，就模棱傍徨起来了。这一批资本家们懂得散布太广泛的力量，是绝不适于发动另一次战争的。因此他们为许多怀疑与恐惧所困惑了。他们之中许多人对于杜鲁门主义的前途，傍徨不定。许多人又对于筹划马歇尔计划所需要的巨额基金，犹豫不前，而主张取消对这援助的反动政治条件。他们同时也怀疑原子弹作为一个决定性军事武器所生的效果。他们恐惧英国将不参加反苏的战争。他们对于欧洲人民的厌战心理，特别是对于美国人民的反战精神，感到惊慌。他们惧怕苏联以及新民主国家的力量。对于他们是否能战胜苏联，他们抱着怀疑的态度，而他们却恐惧着这样的一个战争，反而可能造成了资本主义整个的结束，和社会主义在全世界的胜利。因此对于真正走向战争的政策，他们就感到动摇与傍徨了。由于民主与共和两党的矛盾关系，这个广大资产阶级里的这些矛盾与傍徨，就显得更加严重。有时候这种资产阶级的最大集团，倾向于公开主战派，危险的加强着反苏反民主的政策。比如在胡佛建议书里所主张的美国单独对德缔约政策。但是在另一方面，他们却依然存着缠绵的希望，希望不用战争用谈判的方式，以他们的帝国主义式的和平来欺骗苏联以及其他世界各地。他们在政府中的领袖们，甚至也不时在某些重要问题上和苏联成立一些协议，虽然这都是带着许多痛苦的心情而达成的，这就表示出对未来十一月外长会议的问题发生某些争执是可能的。这一个决定性的资产阶级集团的代理人，有胡佛之流，范登堡之流，杜鲁门之流，马歇尔之流，勒斯之流，杜威之流以及康纳利之流等等。这个集团，就是制定当前美国外交政策的主要集团。大多数劳工最上层领袖，在国际政策上都是追随着这个集团的路线。
    　　　　深得人民拥护的一派
    第三个集团也是资产阶级中的少数派，其中有像华莱士这样杰出的代言人。这是罗斯福这一部分的资产阶级的残余，它所代表的，大多数是较小的资产阶级，在这当中很少有大的财政资本家（如果还有的话）。这个集团追随的，是国际和平的路线，所主张的，是与苏联友好合作和三强团结。这个集团在资产阶级里的援军很少的，但是它却有工会下层干部以及广大人民作它坚实的后盾。（原载七月十一日纽约工人日报，新华社十月二十二日译播）
