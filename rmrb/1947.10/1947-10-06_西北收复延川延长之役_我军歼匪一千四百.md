Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 4th: The Northwest People's Liberation Army Headquarters has announced the results of the recovery of Yanchuan and Yanchang, stating that in this battle, the entire Second Battalion of the 35th Regiment of the 12th Brigade of the reorganized 17th Division of the Chiang bandits, attached with the mortar platoon of the regiment, and the entire Second Battalion of the 70th Regiment of the 24th Brigade of the reorganized 76th Division, as well as all the Chiang-affiliated Baojing (security) teams of the two counties, were completely annihilated. In addition, the baggage train of the 76th Division was routed. A total of over 1,200 people, including the Chiang-appointed magistrate and deputy magistrate of Yanchuan and two battalion commanders, were captured alive, and over 200 people, including two battalion commanders, were killed or wounded. The main spoils of war (excluding the results of local armed forces) included 12 mortars and 60mm guns, 69 light and heavy machine guns, over 400 rifles, and one radio station.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 3rd: Correspondent Ge Bizhou reports: When reporters followed the People's Liberation Army into the Yulin-Hengshan Chiang-controlled area, it was as if they had stepped into a living hell. The villages were desolate and gloomy, and there was no sound of chickens or dogs. The people were sallow and emaciated, and their clothes barely covered their bodies. The jars and basins in the cave dwellings were filled with bran and wild vegetables, and there was not a single grain of food. When the troops were cooking in Fengcun, the hostess pointed to her pot and said, "This pot was only used to cook a meal of rice during the New Year." We stayed overnight in a restaurant, and all the dry food was taken away by the villagers. All the grain that the farmers here worked hard to obtain throughout the year was plundered by the Chiang bandits. Zhao Diansi and three other families in Duileiang Village harvested a total of nine dou and three sheng of grain, but the Chiang bandits extorted twelve shi. In order to pay the levies and grain, Zhao Diansi sold his daughter the year before last and his donkey last year. This year, the bandits ransacked his house, looting everything including oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, melons, vegetables, potatoes, and even shoes, socks, needles, and thread. Zhao Diansi's wife, with tears in her eyes, pointed to her ragged clothes with layers of patches and said, "I was married at the age of fourteen, and this is the dowry that my old man got me when he married me. Now I am in my fifties, and I am still wearing this old ragged jacket."

　　西北收复延川延长之役
  　我军歼匪一千四百
    【新华社西北四日电】西北人民解放军总部顷公布光复延川、延长战果称：此役全歼蒋匪整编十七师十二旅三十五团第二营、附该团迫击炮排，与整编七十六师二十四旅七十团第二营及两县蒋记保警队全部，另击溃七十六师之辎重营。计生俘蒋记延川正副县长及两名营长以下一千二百余人，毙伤两名营长以下二百余人，主要缴获（不包括地方武装战果）有迫击炮及六○炮十二门，轻重机枪六十九挺，步枪四百余支，电台一部。
    【新华社西北三日电】分社记者戈壁舟报导：当记者随解放军进入榆（林）横（山）蒋区时，宛如踏入人间地狱，村庄凄凉阴森，鸡犬不闻；老百姓面黄肌瘦，衣不蔽体。窑洞里大缸小盆尽装糠皮和野菜，没有一颗粮食。部队在冯村做饭时，房主妇指着她的锅子说：“这锅是过年时才作过一顿米饭。”我们在饭店里住了一夜，干粮都被老乡拿走。这里农民们终年辛勤所得的粮食全部被蒋匪刮光了，堆儿梁村赵佃四等四家共打粮九石三斗，蒋匪却勒索了十二石。赵佃四为了缴款纳粮，前年卖了女儿，去年卖了毛驴，今年胡匪翻箱倒柜将油、盐、酱、醋、瓜、菜、洋芋甚至连鞋袜针线都洗劫一空。赵佃四老婆含着眼泪指她层层补钉的破衣衫说：“我是十四岁出嫁的，这是我老汉娶我时的嫁奁衣，现在我活到五十几岁了，还是穿着这套烂裤袄”。
