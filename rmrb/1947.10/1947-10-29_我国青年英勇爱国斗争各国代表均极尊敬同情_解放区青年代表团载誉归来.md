　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: The Chinese Liberated Areas Youth Delegation, which attended the World Youth Festival in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and other international conferences, returned to the country in late September after completing its mission. Representatives of the delegation recently spoke to reporters about their experiences and observations, stating: The delegation departed in mid-July and arrived in Prague in August. They attended the World Youth Festival, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the International Union of Students, and other meetings, and were warmly welcomed by delegations from various countries and the people of Prague. Representatives from various countries highly valued the growing strength of the Chinese people and expressed great respect and concern for the heroic performance of the youth in the liberated areas under the leadership of Chairman Mao in the patriotic self-defense war, as well as the heroic resistance of students in the KMT-controlled areas under the oppression of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. They also expressed indignation at the collusion between the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek in slaughtering Chinese youth. The World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students both passed numerous resolutions condemning the crimes of Chiang and the U.S. and supporting the just struggle of the Chinese youth (see the original text of the resolutions). The former also prevented the KMT's Three People's Principles Youth League from engaging in activities at the conference, while the latter decisively expelled the bogus representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from membership. In front of the democratic youth of the world, this gave the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek, who is guilty of treason, dictatorship, and anti-people civil war, a severe political blow.
　　In international diplomatic relations, although Chiang Kai-shek still temporarily has a "legal" signboard, in international people's diplomacy, his treason, dictatorship, slaughter of youth, and other bloody crimes are well known to the people of various countries. Therefore, his so-called "legal" status has long been abandoned and declared bankrupt by the people of various countries. In various gatherings and parades, the Chinese people's leader Mao Zedong was warmly loved by the youth of various countries, which is in stark contrast to the contempt and ridicule that Chiang Kai-shek received from the youth of various countries. The name of Chairman Mao is not only a brilliant banner for us Chinese youth, but also a brilliant and great symbol recognized by the democratic youth and the broad masses of people all over the world.
　　The delegation paraded in Prague, holding high the Chinese national flag and giant portraits of the people's leaders Mao Zedong and Zhu De, which received cheers and salutes from representatives of various countries and the Czech people. They also screened "Democratic Northeast" and opened an exhibition of liberated areas. In receptions, forums, and public lectures, they exposed the crimes of Chiang and the U.S. in betraying and destroying China and slaughtering the Chinese people, which gained the deep attention and sympathy of representatives from various countries and the Czech people.
　　This is the first time that the Chinese Liberated Areas have sent youth mass representatives to participate in international conferences. Due to our lack of experience and ability, we have not been able to do our work very ideally, but in this trip, we have established good contacts with democratic youth organizations from various countries and laid a foundation for the originally deep friendship.

　　我国青年英勇爱国斗争各国代表均极尊敬同情
    解放区青年代表团载誉归来
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】出席捷京布拉格世界青年节大会等国际会议的中国解放区青年代表团，完成任务后，已于九月下旬返国。该团代表近向记者畅谈此行经过及观感称：本团于七月中旬出国，八月间抵达布拉格，曾先后出席世界青年节大会、世界民主青年联盟国际学联等会议，备受各国代表团及捷京人民的热烈欢迎。各国代表对中国人民力量日益壮大极表重视，对毛主席领导下的解放区青年在爱国自卫战争中的英勇表现，及蒋管区学生在蒋匪压迫下的壮烈反抗，极表尊敬与关怀，对美蒋勾结屠杀中国青年则同表愤慨。世界民主联盟及国际学联，均通过谴责蒋美罪行及声援中国青年斗争的正义决议案多项（见决议原文），前者并制止了蒋匪三青团在会上活动的企图，后者则断然开除了蒋匪伪代表的会员资格。在全世界民主青年面前，给予卖国、独裁、反人民内战的匪首蒋介石以严重的政治打击。
    在国际外交关系上，蒋介石虽然暂时还有一块“合法”的招牌，但在国际人民外交上，由于他的卖国、独裁、屠杀青年等种种血腥罪行，已为各国人民所深悉，因此他的所谓“合法”的地位，早已为各国人民所唾弃而宣告破产。在各种集会和游行中，中国人民领袖毛泽东受到各国青年的热烈爱戴，正与蒋介石所受到各国青年的鄙视和嘲笑形成强烈的对照。毛主席的名字，不但是我们中国青年的光辉旗帜，而且已成为全世界的民主青年和广大人民所公认的光辉伟大的象征。
    本团曾在布拉格高举中国国旗及人民领袖毛泽东、朱德巨像游行，获得各国代表和捷克人民的欢呼和致敬。并曾放演“民主东北”、开创解放区展览会，在招待会、座谈会及公开讲演会中，揭露蒋美卖国亡华，屠杀中国人民的罪行，获得各国代表及捷克人民的深切注意与同情。
    中国解放区派遣青年群众性的代表参加国际会议，这还是初次。由于我们经验能力的不足，还没有能把工作干得很理想，但在此行中，已经和各国民主青年团体取得很好的联系，并已为本来的深厚的友谊奠定基础。
