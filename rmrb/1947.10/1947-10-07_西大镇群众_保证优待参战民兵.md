　　Xida Town Residents
  　Guarantee Preferential Treatment for Militia Participating in the War
    [This newspaper, Changzhi News] On the morning of the 26th, Xida Town, Fourth District, broadcast news of the victorious counter-offensive over the radio. In the afternoon, more than 500 men and women from the entire village spontaneously gathered to discuss the victorious counter-offensive by the Liu-Deng-Chen-Xie armies, the recovery of nearly 40 county towns, and the complete elimination of the Chiang bandits from the 500-mile railway line from Luoyang in the east to Tongguan in the west. South to the Yangtze River, the masses were filled with sky-high enthusiasm. When they talked about the militia and self-defense forces crossing the river to participate in the war, Li Xiaogou of the Armed Forces Committee, Yang Yixi, the manager of the cooperative, and others bravely volunteered on the spot, all wanting to fight across the river several times, to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, dig up the old roots, and completely transform themselves by not being selfish, not falling behind, and resolutely completing the tasks. Model group leaders Li Sanfu, Wang Chenzhi, and more than a dozen others said at the meeting: "We will definitely guarantee to harvest your crops and plow the land for you first!" Women's Chairman Wang Shuzhen said: "I am determined to lead the women to participate in mutual aid to solve your family's petty difficulties." The masses were very excited, and unanimously shouted: "It is most glorious to participate in the war! Everyone must participate in the war! Support Chairman Mao! Support the Liu-Deng armies to make persistent efforts!"
