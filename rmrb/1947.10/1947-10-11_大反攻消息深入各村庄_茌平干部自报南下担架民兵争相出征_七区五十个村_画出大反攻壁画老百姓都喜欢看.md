The news of the great counter-offensive has deeply penetrated every village, and cadres and masses are all involved in the counter-offensive wave. At a meeting in Chiping's Seventh District, 41 cadres volunteered to go south, and in the Eighth District, 78 volunteered. In Balizhuang village, in the Second District, nine village cadres volunteered to go south for the counter-offensive. In the Third District, 15 district cadres alone volunteered to go south. A village cadre from Haoji in the Seventh District said: "Unless General Liu Bocheng orders me to, I will never return. I will definitely work hard and win the title of Counter-Offensive Champion! Before I leave, I will still handle the village work well." All the stretcher teams in the Second and Third Districts were self-nominated. When 120 stretchers from the Seventh District went to the front, representatives of the people from the entire district went to Tucheng to welcome them in formation, with cannon salutes, flower offerings, wine offerings, and Yangko dances. The masses in Haoji gave each stretcher team member two pears and a cigarette, while the masses in Wanzhuang and other places gave the stretcher teams clothes and shoes. District and village cadres immediately expressed that they would take good care of the stretcher team members' families. The moved stretcher team members all swore: "We will definitely complete the task well at the front. As long as the higher-ups need us, we can stay for three years. Anyone who says they want to come back is not his mother's son!" In Zhouji, in the Eighth District, 12 stretcher bearers were supposed to go, but 16 signed up, all vying to go. In Wangtun, in the Fifth District, a poor peasant fought to carry a stretcher, saying: "I have no wife or children, no burdens, let me go for you!" The Chiping Militia Regiment returned victoriously from the front. Passing through San Shilipu in the Sixth District, the masses requested that the seven machine guns won as spoils of war be exhibited, and hearing vivid stories of victory from them greatly encouraged the militiamen and self-defense forces at home, who eagerly wanted to go to the front line. Young people in Cuihezhuang, Haoji, and other villages in the Seventh District volunteered to be militiamen, willing to go to the front line. On September 21st, when the militia company of the Eighth District returned after completing its mission, two to three thousand people's representatives from the Eighth District lined up outside Shelang Village to welcome them, clapping, setting off cannons, and performing Yangko dances, which was very lively. The militiamen spoke freely about the situation of our army annihilating the enemy's 57th Division. In the evening, they also performed "The White-Haired Girl," which they had learned at the front, for everyone. After hearing the report, the people at home clamored to go to the front to fight old Chiang. When the × Battalion of the East China Field Army arrived in Nanbeizhang in the Third District, the masses said, "Our own troops have arrived!" They automatically found all the bowls and chopsticks needed by the entire battalion and delivered them to the soldiers' hands. They also took the soldiers' clothes to wash and slaughtered a pig to comfort the army. An old lady, a military dependent, said to the battalion commander: "Seeing you is like seeing my son!" When the battalion left, the whole village lined up to see them off, shouting: "Wish you more victories!" The troops also cheered: "We are the people's soldiers, resolutely overthrow Chiang Kai-shek!" When Caozhuang in the First District heard that the troops were coming to the village, the elementary school Yangko team went to welcome them, dancing the Yangko. When the children's corps in Haoji in the Seventh District heard about the counter-offensive, they automatically cut counter-offensive grass to prepare for military use, and they have already dried more than 3,000 catties. Women in the Seventh District automatically donated 1,500 pairs of counter-offensive shoes. Women in Juying village alone rushed to make 110 pairs of counter-offensive shoes day and night, and voluntarily did not want any compensation. The district cadres immediately praised them, and in order to take care of the masses' production, they still gave them the compensation they deserved. The masses in various districts rushed to send counter-offensive noodles day and night. Yu Kechang, a 69-year-old man from Zhouji in the Eighth District, volunteered to send counter-offensive noodles to the front, saying: "Young people carry stretchers, women produce, and it is right for us old men to send noodles!" The counter-offensive propaganda work is also very active. In the Seventh District, all fifty villages in the district have counter-offensive murals. Meng Fanzhen, an elementary school teacher, and others created colorful murals using brick powder, locust branches, and red soil in eleven villages including Haoji, Juying, and Wanzhuang in the Seventh District. They are bright and eye-catching, and the people all like to watch them. In Ershilipu in the Sixth District, the struggle stories of the village were drawn into comic strip murals, which were especially welcomed by the masses. The counter-offensive colored banners in Sujizhuang in the Fourth District wrote down the victories of the year, and there was a continuous stream of people watching. Now, the celebration of the counter-offensive has gradually spread to every village. After hearing the news of the great counter-offensive, all the cadres in the Third District of Puyang were excited and jubilant, guaranteeing to complete the rear service support task 100%, and held celebrations of the counter-offensive in various villages, so that the masses had a full understanding of the current situation. After studying the new situation, the cadres in the Second District of Fanxian all smiled happily, and all expressed that they had no objection to being transferred south. If they were not transferred, they would work hard to deepen their work. In this season with the most rain, the comrades went out to work in the rain.
