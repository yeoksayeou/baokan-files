[Reported by our newspaper in Anyang] During the Mid-Autumn Festival, meetings were held in various districts and villages to celebrate the victory of the counter-offensive. Villages staged operas, performed Yangko dances, and held lantern parades in the evening. Amidst the joyous celebrations of the masses, farmers in various places shouted slogans such as: "Celebrate the Great Counter-Offensive, Join the Great Counter-Offensive Army!" "If you want to completely emancipate yourself, join the counter-offensive army!" "Overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, and the peasants will rule the world!" Under such slogans, a wave of enthusiasm for joining the army swept across the county. According to reports from the 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th districts in one day and night on the 30th, 744 people had joined the army, exceeding expectations. Emancipated farmers and district and village cadres were in high spirits. The 6th district proposed a competition to the 3rd and 7th districts. Guo Limin, a Communist Party member from Xishangzhuang in the 8th district, and Li Baozi, a Communist Party member from the 4th district, took the lead in joining the army at the conference. Hou Damao from Dazhengji joined the army to avenge his father (who was killed by the landlord's "Homecoming Corps"). Li Panghai, the militia captain from Dujiagang in the 3rd district, led 17 cadres and militiamen to collectively join the army. Following this, 28 village cadres, including the director of the Farmers' Association from Xihejiafen and the militia team from Wulijian, signed up to join the army on the spot. Cadres from Nanshanzhuang village in the 7th district, after returning from a meeting in the district, immediately convened the masses to discuss expanding the army without even eating. Six people joined overnight, and eight villages had 48 young people join the army overnight. (Yu Ming, Wen Zhi, Jian Ye, Zhu Yan, Wang Qixing, Xin Fa)

[Reported by our newspaper in Bo'ai] The emancipated farmers of Bo'ai demonstrated a high degree of class consciousness in this recruitment, shouting slogans with magnificent spirit such as "Seize the world, rule the country, join the victorious army, and protect the treasure bowl!" At a mass rally of over a thousand people held by the 3rd district on the 19th of last month to celebrate the great counter-offensive, 58 young people joined the army, led by Communist Party member Cui Daming. When the chairman finished his report and asked what we should do, the emancipated farmers answered fluently: "Have we completely emancipated ourselves?" "We have!" "Are we ruling the world?" "We are!" "Is it stable?" "Not very stable!" "Why?" "Because there is still Chiang Kai-shek!" "How can we make it stable?" "Join the victorious army and uproot the old root!" The masses in Baishan village, only five miles away from the enemy, all moved to the mountain × village. After hearing about the great counter-offensive, they immediately launched a vigorous wave of joining the army. Liu Baofu, 19, was the first to sign up, saying: "I want to play the role of a locomotive, open up Jiaozuo, liberate Xinxiang, and eliminate Chiang Kai-shek!" He alone mobilized 16 young people to join the army. Old farmer Liu Jiuyou sent his third son to join the army, saying: "My second son has gone to Henan to fight. The enemies in Jiaozuo are harassing us every day. I want my third son to join the army to recover Jiaozuo." Old meritorious worker Chen Yuanhong from Sujiazhai couldn't sleep all night when he heard that the new soldiers were leaving. He went to see them off at dawn and repeatedly urged them: "Everyone should always think about how time came about? Who are we working for?" The soldiers replied loudly: "Grandpa Yuanhong, don't worry, we will never return until we overthrow Chiang Kai-shek!"

[Reported by our newspaper in Zuoquan] On the evening of the second day of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Getdao village in the 5th district held a forum for poor peasants, hired laborers, and the masses. At the meeting, everyone discussed the current victorious situation. Encouraged by this news of victory, the poor peasants and hired laborers Chen Xiaoma and Chang Erchou said excitedly: The great victory at the front is to completely uproot the old feudal roots, and this requires strengthening our People's Liberation Army to uproot them faster. Therefore, the two of us are signing up to join the army and await orders to move out. Influenced by them, 35 more people signed up. Everyone unanimously said: We will leave whenever the higher authorities dispatch us. If the higher authorities do not dispatch us, we will participate in mutual aid teams at home, produce well, and properly control Little Chiang (the landlord). (Wang Zisheng, Yuan Qing)

[Reported by our newspaper in Jiexiu] In Shangliang Village, the first district, tenant farmers and militiamen are enthusiastically joining the army. From September 6th to the 15th, 18 people registered to join the army in ten days. Together with four tenant farmers and two members of the emancipation team from Xialiang, a total of 24 heroes initially formed the "Three Tigers Company," becoming a model village for joining the army in Jiexiu. Shangliang is a key village in Jiexiu, where the struggle between the enemy and us is sharp, and the situation is unstable. Cadres and villagers transfer outside the village every day, and collective deliberation and mobilization are not easy. However, due to the in-depth land reform work in the village in the past, which was the best in the county for the "two-in-one movement," the peasants have been more thoroughly emancipated than in other villages, and their class consciousness is high. Therefore, the situation of this army recruitment movement quickly broke out. Under the banner of Zhang Sanhu, an emancipation hero who killed the enemy, 24 young people joined the army within ten days.

Their experience is: 1. Carry out systematic and organized recruitment mobilization work, propose competitions between units, and ensure that preferential treatment is given to military families. In the land reform, let the military families be completely emancipated first. 2. There must be a leading core for joining the army, but it should not be exposed too early. It must appear during the period of heated brewing and near maturity, and its role will be greater. 3. Give more praise, more encouragement, and carry out current affairs education and enlightenment to improve class consciousness in a concrete and prominent manner. (Jiali)

[Reported by our newspaper on the 7th from Taiyue] "Join the counter-offensive army and uproot the old source of calamity!" Eight counties including Linfen, Qinshui, and Fushan in Taiyue have been swept by a huge wave of joining the army. Communist Party members are taking the lead everywhere, with dozens or hundreds of people joining the counter-offensive army. After Wu Jianguang, a Communist Party member from Nanciying, Yangcheng, signed up, 53 young people followed suit. Another Communist Party member, Liang Jinke, also led 60 young militiamen to join the counter-offensive army. Wang Huairen, secretary of the Linfen CCP branch, made a guarantee to the party and personally led 120 outstanding party members and young people to sign up and join the counter-offensive front. Many elderly people have sent their sons to the army more than once. After receiving the news of the great counter-offensive, they excitedly sent their last children to the counter-offensive front. Zhao Maiwang from Jia Village, Tunliu, is over 60 years old and had already sent two children to the People's Liberation Army in the past. The eldest child has already gloriously sacrificed. This time, he sent his last child to the counter-offensive army. After receiving the news of the great counter-offensive in Yangjiahe, Qinshui, Li Guisheng, Niu Haiquan, Zhao Tianyin, Wang Zhengsi, and Ma Changshan immediately signed up. Han Xiaoji was anxious to join but couldn't because he was too old. He quickly found his brother Han Xuewen and said: "Brother, I am too old and don't count! What about you?" His brother immediately replied: "Let's do it!" Kang Baoxun, a worker at the Fushan Hancun Prefectural Commissioner's Farm, saw that 300 people in the county had signed up to join the counter-offensive army and said: "Workers are the basic people of the Communist Party. Who will take the lead if the workers don't?" He rushed to sign up.

　　共产党员及翻身贫雇带头
  　太行太岳卷起参军潮
  　支援大反攻，参加胜利军！打倒蒋介石，拔掉老祸根！
    【本报安阳讯】在中秋节各区村都开会庆祝反攻胜利，各村唱戏、扭秧歌，晚上还有提灯会。在群众欢天喜地的庆祝胜利中，各地农民喊出了：“庆祝大反攻，参加大反攻！”“想要翻透身，参加反攻军！”“打倒蒋介石，农民坐天下！”在这样的口号下，全县掀起了参军热潮，在三十日的一天一夜中，据三、五、六、七、八五个区报告，已有七百四十四人参军，超过了预计。翻身农民和区村干部情绪都很高涨，六区向三、七区提出竞赛，八区西上庄共产党员郭里民，四区共产党员李豹子都在大会上带头参军，大正集侯大茂为父报仇（父亲被地主“还乡团”害了）参军，三区杜家岗民兵队长李胖孩带领十七位干部民兵集体参军，接着有西何家坟农会主任、五里涧民兵队等二十八位村干部当场报名参军，七区南善庄村干部从区上开会回去顾不上吃饭就召集群众商量扩军，一夜六名，有八个村一夜就有四十八位青年参军。（玉明、文智、建业、朱炎、王启星、新法）
    【本报博爱讯】博爱翻身农民在此次参军中，表现了高度的阶级自觉，喊出“夺天下，坐江山，参加胜利军，保卫聚宝盆”等气魄宏伟的口号。三区于上月十九日召开庆祝大反攻的千余群众大会上，在共产党员崔大名带头下五十八位青年参军。当主席报告完时而提出我们该怎么办时，翻身农民对答如流：“咱们翻透身了没有”？“翻透了”！“咱坐天下了没有”？“坐了”！“坐的稳不稳呀”？“不大稳”！“为什么呀”？“还有蒋介石”！“怎样才能坐稳呀”？“参加胜利军，刨倒老根”！距敌仅五里的柏山村群众，全部转移到山上×村，听说大反攻后，立掀起轰轰烈烈的参军浪潮，十九岁的刘宝富首先报名说：“我要起火车头作用，打开焦作、解放新乡，消灭蒋介石”！一人即动员了十六位青年参军。翻身老农刘九友又送三儿参军说：“我二儿到河南参战去了，焦作敌人天天扰乱，我要叫三儿参军收复焦作。”苏家寨老功臣陈元洪听说新战士要走，一夜睡不着，天明去送别，再三叮咛说：“大家要常想时光是怎样来的？我们是给谁干的？”……战士们大声的回答说：“元洪爷，你放心，不打倒蒋介石，誓不回还！”

    【本报左权讯】五区圪道村在中秋节的第二天晚上召开了贫雇和群众座谈会，在这会上大家讨论了现在的胜利情况，在这胜利消息鼓舞下，有贫雇陈小马、常二丑等二人激动的说：前方这样大的胜利就是为了彻底刨封建老根，这得壮大我们解放军才能刨得更快。所以我二人报名参军，待令出动。在他二人影响下，又三十五个人都报了名。大家一致说：上级啥时候调咱就啥时候走，上级不调咱就在家参加互助组，好好生产，好好把小蒋（地主）管制起来。（王子胜、元庆）
    【本报介休讯】一区上梁村，翻身佃户、民兵，踊跃参军；从九月六号起至十五日，十天内报名参军者达十八名，再加上下梁四名参军佃户与翻身队战士两名，共二十四名英雄，初步成立了“三虎连”，成为介休参军典型村庄。上梁为介休焦点村，敌我斗争尖锐，情况不稳，干部、村民每日转移村外宿息，集体性进行酝酿、动员不易。可是由于以往该村土改工作深入，为全县“两位一体运动”之冠，农民翻身较其他村彻底，阶级觉悟高，所以此次参军运动局面迅速突开，在翻身杀敌英雄张三虎插旗号召，带头参军下，十天内二十四名青壮年参了军。
    他们的经验是：一、要有系统、有组织地进行参军动员工作，各单位间提出竞赛，保证做到切实优待军属，土改中先让参军户翻透身。二、参军要有带头核心，可是不宜过早暴露，出现必须在酝酿热烈与将近成熟期，作用就更大。三、多表扬、多鼓舞、具体、突出地进行时事教育与启发与提高阶级自觉。（加里）
    【本报太岳七日电】“参加反攻军，拔掉老祸根！”太岳临汾、沁水、浮山等八个县，已卷起巨大的参军浪潮，到处是共产党员带头，几十个上百个的参加了反攻军。阳城南次营共产党员武建光报名后，接着就是五十三个青年人争先恐后的报名；另一位共产党员梁进科，也带领六十个青年民兵参加了反攻军。临汾中共分委书记王怀仁向党提出保证，亲自带领一百二十位优秀党员与青年报名，投奔反攻前线。更有不少老年人，已经不止一次的送子参军了，此次得到大反攻消息后，兴奋的把最后的孩子也送到反攻前线去了。屯留贾村赵脉旺，有六十多岁过去已将两个孩子送进了解放军，大孩子且已经光荣牺牲，这次他又把最后一个孩子送到反攻大军里去了。在沁水杨家河得到大反攻消息后，马上就有李桂生、牛海全、赵天银、王正思、马常山报名，把韩小吉看的急了，但因自己年纪太大，不能参军，赶紧去找他兄弟韩学文说：“兄弟，我年纪大了不算话！你怎样？”他兄弟随即回说：“干！”浮山韩村专署农场工人康宝埙，看到全县一下有三百人报名参加反攻军，就说：“工人是共产党的基本人，工人不带头谁带头？”抢着报了名。
