Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st. Warsaw dispatch: After visiting Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union, a delegation of British Labour Party members of Parliament arrived in Poland recently. On the 16th, the delegation held a press conference here and issued a statement summarizing their impressions after visiting the four countries. The statement first vehemently denounced the so-called "Iron Curtain" as absurd, stating: "After 'touring' the four countries, we are fully capable of refuting this dangerous and ridiculous slander." The statement continued: "It is extremely important to oppose the propaganda of the so-called 'Iron Curtain' because we are deeply convinced that Eastern Europe and Britain can complement each other economically. We believe that those who oppose the establishment of trade relations with Eastern European countries are intentionally or unintentionally placing Britain under the control of American capital. Labour Party members believe that most British workers are deeply convinced of the necessity of close cooperation between the Allies in peacetime, because they fully understand that the close cooperation of the Allies during the war guaranteed the victory over fascism."

When answering reporters' questions, the head of the delegation, Zilliacus, criticized the Marshall Plan, saying: "This is a sign of the United States' attempt to establish its hegemony in Europe and rule Western Germany." Zilliacus expressed doubt as to whether the U.S. Congress would actually pass the loans to Europe, and said, "Even if the loans are passed, the harsh conditions of the loans will be unacceptable to various countries." "Attempts to use loans to achieve political oppression will cause disaster." Zilliacus continued to discuss the conference of the nine European communist parties, saying: "The agreements reached at the conference are a positive factor; in the interests of the Labour Party, the Labour Party should revise its policies." When answering questions about the British cabinet reshuffle, delegation member Lee said, "As I see it, the new cabinet is more right-leaning, not left-leaning." Delegation member Chiang Pin pointed out: "The Labour Party left wing is committed to strengthening cooperation with the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland." "If Britain falls into the economic sphere of influence of the United States, we will have to share the serious consequences of the looming economic panic in the United States." Delegation member Thomas believed that if the United States does not change its attitude towards Europe, Britain may change its policies. The British people generally believe that since the United States is the only Allied country that has become richer from this war, some of its wealth must be distributed to other Allied countries that have suffered great sacrifices, as compensation. Thomas finally emphasized: "Germany must never become a base for American capital aggression."

It is reported that the delegation has already embarked on its return journey to Britain. In addition to the above-mentioned members, the delegation also includes Parkin, Wyatt, Allen, Hughes, Bannister, and others.

　　英工党议员代表团发表声明
  　深信英与东欧能够合作
    痛斥美国图独霸和奴役欧洲
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】华沙讯：英国国会工党议员代表团在遍访捷、南、苏三国后，于日前抵达波兰在该团并于十六日在此间记者招待会上发表声明，总结他们访问四国后的观感。声明首先痛斥所谓“铁幕”的无稽之谈称：“我们‘周游’四国以后，已足能驳倒这种危险而无聊的谰言。”声明继称：“反对所谓‘铁幕’的宣传极端重要，因为我们深信东欧与英国是能够在经济上互相补足的。我们相信，我们那些反对与东欧国家建立贸易关系的人，都有意无意地置英国于美国资本控制之下。工党议员们认为大多数英国工人深信盟国在和平时期密切合作的必要，因为他们完全了解盟国战时的密切合作曾保证了对法西斯主义的胜利。”
    该团团长齐里亚库斯在答复记者询问时，批评马歇尔计划称：“这是美国力图建立其欧洲霸权与统治德国西部的标志。”齐氏对于美国国会究竟能否通过对欧贷款表示怀疑，并称：“即使贷款被通过，但贷款条件的苛刻亦为各国所不能接受。”“为达到政治压迫而运用贷款的企图，将造成灾祸。”齐氏继论述欧洲九国共产党会议称：“该会议已达成的协议是积极的因素；就工党利益来说，工党应修正它的政策。”团员李氏在回答关于英阁改组的询问时称：“据我看来，新阁已更加右倾而并非左倾。”团员蒋宾指出：“工党左派把加强与苏、南、捷、波的合作为己任。”“如英国陷入美国经济势力范围之内，我们就要分担美国迫在眉睫的经济恐慌之严重后果。”团员汤姆士认为：如美国不改变其对欧态度，英国即可能改变政策。英国人民普遍认为：美国既然是唯一从这次大战中变得更富的盟国，则其财富就必须分配一部给其他蒙受极大牺牲的盟国，以为补偿。汤姆士最后力称：“德国决不应成为美国资本侵略的基地。”
    据悉：该团已首途返英，团员除上述诸人外，尚有派金、惠特、艾伦、休士、班氏等。
