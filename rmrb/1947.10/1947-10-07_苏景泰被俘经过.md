Xinhua News Agency, Frontline, Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan-Liaoning, 5th: Delayed news: Reporter Xie Wenqing reported the capture of bandit Su Jingtai, deputy commander of the 93rd Army's Provisional 22nd Division, and his Chief of Staff, Ning Jian: After the People's Liberation Army (PLA) controlled the fortresses on all sides of Yangzhangzi Mountain, Su Jingtai and his Chief of Staff were still directing the logistics units to retreat quickly from the telephone. The PLA arrived with the force of a heavenly army. PLA soldiers, holding guns, rushed into a foreign-style house, and saw a fat, tall man with a beard, wearing an American army garrison cap, sitting at a table. On the bed lay a bearded fellow of about forty years of age, with two young lads resembling grooms standing beside him. Yu Dechun, a nineteen-year-old PLA soldier, raised his bayonet and shouted, "Surrender your weapons or not! Hands up!" All four obediently raised their hands. The fat man feigned composure and said, "What are you doing, kid?" Yu Dechun took a step forward and scolded, "Why are you putting on airs! Behave yourself. The PLA treats prisoners well." After a search, one of the lads standing beside pointed to the fat, tall man and said, "This is our deputy division commander," and then pointed to the bearded man, "This is our chief of staff." Yu Dechun then tightened his grip on the bayonet and ordered them, "Follow me!"

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 5th: The people's local armed forces and militia, deeply penetrating the enemy's rear in the Daqing River, Tianjin-Baoding triangle area, are constantly active between the enemy's points and lines, persist in fighting, and constantly achieve victories. In Zhuoxian, Daxing, Wanping, Liangxiang, and other counties, the local armed forces, in September alone, killed or wounded more than 80 enemy bandits and policemen, including a company commander of the 14th Engineering Regiment, and captured seven alive. In the anti-"mopping-up" campaign, the Tianjin (Tianjin) Wuqing (Wuqing) militia company was mobile and flexible, using tactics such as explosions, sniping, ambushes, and attacks. In mid-August, the militia of this company fought fiercely with the puppet Zhai Wuqiong and others, numbering over seventy, for two days and nights at Xiaozhuangzi, repelling the enemy. On the 18th, over a hundred enemies from Wangqingtuo, sixty miles southwest of Tianjin, sneaked into Taohe Village and were ambushed by the militia, resulting in two enemy casualties. Militia member Song Shenlin single-handedly captured an enemy soldier.
