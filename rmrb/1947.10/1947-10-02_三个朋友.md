　　Three Friends
    Wéi Jūnyí
    "Old friend! Did you just come from Beiping? Eight years apart, if we met on the street, we really wouldn't recognize each other. Don't be surprised, look at me, don't I look like a street cleaner from your place?
    You ask me about the changes in the past ten years? That's truly a twenty-four history, where do I even begin?
    Don't praise us people from the liberated areas too highly, it makes me blush. Back then, weren't we all the same? Everyone changes little by little. I wouldn't dare to say learn from me. – You want to ask about my good teachers and helpful friends? I don't have any great people's amazing deeds to tell you. My friends are also ordinary people, the changes are also ordinary changes, alright, I'll just casually tell you a story.
    In '43, I had just gone to the countryside and lived in the home of Liu Jinkuan, the newly selected labor hero in Liu Village. I had three friends in this village, three people who were all different: one intellectual, one gentleman, and one farmer.
    Let's talk about my farmer friend first, my landlord Liu Jinkuan. At first, naturally, I couldn't call him a friend. Living there, I felt like the Tang Sanzang going to the Western Paradise to obtain scriptures. In order to achieve enlightenment, I had to grit my teeth and endure suffering, to get through those eighty-one tribulations. Every day, I tried my best to find ways to integrate into their lives, to make them not see me as an outsider. Besides doing work, I went to the mountains with them every day, trying to understand what "straight valley," "Zhi valley," "An Zhong valley" was... Since going to the countryside, I hadn't shaved for several months. When Liu Jinkuan's wife went back to her parents' home, I lay down and slept with him on the same kang. When the Liu family ran out of donkey grass, I helped them chop grass. When their yard got dirty, I swept it for them. Before going to the countryside, I deliberately didn't dare to bring even a single literary book. I even noticed that Liu's old woman looked at me brushing my teeth with surprise every day, and I didn't even dare to brush my teeth anymore.
    You can't say I was just like someone in exile there all day. I also joked and laughed with them. When Liu's old woman's hen started brooding, I held the first chick and ran and laughed to show it to them. If the donkey ate too much grass, I could happily discuss it with them all evening. For a period of time, even I almost believed that I had completely changed. – But it didn't work! I wasn't afraid of digging soil and carrying manure, I could do it by gritting my teeth. Only one thing I couldn't deceive myself about: there always seemed to be a small, inviolable gap in my heart. As soon as I stopped working, as soon as I put down the hoe, that gap slowly expanded, turning into a real sense of loneliness. I couldn't stand even a little external stimulation, like a primary school student who cheated and got 100 points on the exam, and was exposed as soon as they were tested in class.
    Just take one time, I received a letter from a distant friend. The letter said: Chengdu's mood is like Beiping, hearing the sound of flower selling in the deep alleys. She asked, "What about you?" The days after receiving the letter made my loneliness reach its peak. One afternoon, I squatted alone by the stone trough in Liu's yard, watching the gradually hazy treetops outside the wall, trying to listen – the stone roller in the yard made an extremely heavy creaking sound, as Liu's old woman pulled the roller to press black bean coins, a coarse hemp rope around her shoulders. Then Liu Jinkuan's wife stood in the center of the yard and let out a long roar: "Erláoláoláoláo..." Immediately, a big black sow led a group of piglets straight to the stone trough beside me to eat, the big pig calling out "@ @ @" and the piglets calling out "Squeak squeak"! This real environment and that letter were simply an extremely ironic contrast. I couldn't help but gently "@" ! Liu Jinkuan was walking over and happened to hear it. He said, "Old Wu, what are you worried about – oh! You must be worried about that piglet we lost." So he told me that in the afternoon they found it, it had fallen into the outhouse and was suffocated into a pile of excrement. He didn't know if it could still live. Liu's old woman and Liu Jinkuan's wife also chimed in. That evening, their whole family was just talking about the piglet that fell into the outhouse, talking about it while eating, talking about it while working. I knew that I should be talking along with them, but that loneliness had come and didn't want to leave, expanding larger and larger, pressing down on my mind like a grindstone. I ate in silence, even eating very little. Putting down my bowl, I walked to the center of the yard with my hands behind my back. Under this attack of loneliness, I forgot all the other principles at once. My heart was blocked with the thought that "Even Tang Sanzang had to rest his legs on the way to get scriptures. Just let me wander around somewhere!" Just then, the village chief suddenly ran in to greet me, saying that the special district had sent another intellectual cadre to Liu Village today.
    That person was called Luo Ping, he did economic work. I knew him in the city, but not very well. To be honest, I still found a bit of that guy’s “hee hee hee ha ha ha” set of perfunctory polite ways annoying. But for some reason, hearing that he was coming made me so happy, as if I had met my closest relatives in a distant and lonely foreign land, as if he were the only confidant I had been looking forward to for more than a month. Hearing the news, I immediately jumped up and ran all the way to the entrance of the village to welcome him, carrying his bag and luggage, pulling his hand and running into the village. I greeted him to eat, drink water, wash his feet. That night, I especially ran to the village cooperative to sleep with him, asking him about the situation in the city. I told him everything I knew about Liu Village, cadres, labor heroes, customs, and even my personal life. He told me about the recent art exhibition in the city, the new foreigners, and even someone's love affairs, etc. I felt that these things sounded so familiar and smooth to my ears, as if these were the things in my own world. Unconsciously, we talked until the rooster almost crowed before closing our eyes.
    I was very happy when I was chatting with him, my mind was unobstructed and I didn't think about anything. Until after closing my eyes, dimly, a thought suddenly jumped into my consciousness. That evening's scene suddenly made me think of the vague feeling I had when I was in exile in Hankou in 1937 - friend! Do you remember that time watching a movie, the sentence I told you, I said: "As soon as I entered this movie theater with light blue walls, the lights dimmed, the screen flashed, and the jazzy tunes in front of the music stand clanged, I felt an indescribable familiar atmosphere, as if I had left this hot and unfamiliar Hankou and returned to my original familiar, beautiful, and comfortable world." This old saying emerged in the middle of the night in Liu Village. I suddenly felt as if someone was standing in a dark place gesturing mockingly at me, that person was laughing: "Haha! Hehe! You're still the same!" I really felt like there was nowhere to hide from his ridicule.
    Am I really still the same? – Of course! At this time, the loneliness was also dispelled. Sleeping in this strange place, thinking about how Liu Jinkuan's family must be waiting for me and looking for me, I felt like a deserter, feeling uncomfortable all night, unable to sleep on that bed in the cooperative. Early the next morning, I ran back to Liu Jinkuan's house with a red face, and I worked extra hard for them that day.
    I went to the mountain with Liu Jinkuan's work exchange group to plant millet. Liu Jinkai and Wang Xiangru were in one group, and Liu Jinkuan and I were in one group. He plowed the rows, and I followed behind with manure and seeds. The spring wind after Grain Rain floated around on the mountain. One hill connected to another, like big waves stirred by the wind. The wheat seedlings next to the millet field were already three or four inches high, rippling with a layer of emerald green ripples, one wave chasing another. I took a deep breath with my nose, and my lungs were immediately filled with fresh air. Then I exhaled a long breath. Liu Jinkuan heard it in front and turned around to ask me: "Old Wu, what's wrong? Why are you sighing again?" I said: "It's nothing? I think this place is very beautiful, the scenery is so good!" He said: "Yes! The soil is really good this year. Look at that wheat field, Qi Ge Peng Peng is full of green on the mountain, I guarantee you Old Wu will eat good noodles!" I quickly changed the subject and talked about the crops. He plowed very deeply, and the black soil containing moisture turned up, burying over my feet. The soil seemed to have a full, warm fragrance, which was also turned out, smelling very comfortable. The sun rose higher, and I sweated. The feeling of unease gradually disappeared. I asked myself: "Am I not happy in this world of red sun and green wheat fields? This is also my world, why do I always miss that world with light blue walls? Why can't I take Liu Jinkuan as my confidant friend? Why..." - While sweating and thinking, the two of us plowed faster and faster, and soon caught up with Wang Xiangru and Liu Jinkai in front. I heard Wang Xiangru and Liu Jinkai discussing that Liu Jinkuan really drives the plot, unlike Chen Faxing, who falsely reports the number of plots, and he is nominally reducing rent, but actually not reducing it.
    Liu Jinkuan suddenly stood up straight with great emotion and said loudly: "Who doesn't know that? He rented seven plots of Huang's land from others, and now it has become five plots. Is this to deceive the people in his own village, or to deceive Old Wu? Look at how Old Wu gets up early and goes to bed late to plan for us, goes to the land with us to suffer, and his heart is all for us! Last night, because my piglet fell into the outhouse, Old Wu was so worried that he couldn't even eat. Even one's own parents, one's own brothers, I don't know if they can treat us as kindly as Old Wu?"
    My face suddenly flushed. His words hit the self-pitying thoughts in my heart. You know, I went there to educate them, and although I was with Liu Jinkuan every day, eating together and living together, his position in my heart was just a work object, one of many objects, like a sorghum stalk in a mountain of sorghum. But he felt exactly the opposite about me. He really regarded me as a confidant. Or say, one level higher than a confidant. When I first arrived, Liu's old woman once told me that Liu Jinkuan was forty-six years old that year, and his family had a total of fifteen plots, including rented land and self-owned land, but Liu Jinkuan later told me that he was actually only thirty-seven years old, and there were still seven plots more of land. He said his mother lied, she was too backward, believed in other people's rumors, was afraid of everything, was afraid that we would take it over and make it public property. She also believed that the landlord Huang Siye was a benefactor and didn't want to reduce rent. In addition, I also learned from him several strange and great humiliations of his life. – Huang Siye's nineteen-year-old young wife slapped him in the face, the young master used him as a horse to ride...etc. I had long seen that Liu Jinkuan was a very strong person who wouldn't bow his head. He probably rarely talked about such things with people, but he talked about them with me, a person he had only known for two months and whose past life was very different. This made me very confused, especially that night when I ran to Luo Ping to escape loneliness, and the next day I heard Liu Jinkuan praising me on the mountain (and saying I was worried about him!). I really felt that he was more powerful than scolding me. From this, I was reminded of the ways Liu Jinkuan had treated me on weekdays. I secretly evaluated myself in my heart: If my mother was also in the liberated area, if she was unwilling to reduce rent, or secretly complained about the revolution, etc., could I tell these things to someone like Liu Jinkuan? – I couldn't! It was simply unimaginable! I had always prided myself on being the most pure-hearted person, only suffering losses myself and never doing anything to let people down. But, at this time in front of Liu Jinkuan, I suddenly felt that I was a bit like the unrighteous people written in old novels, who treated him as heavy as a mountain, entrusting his wife and children to him, but he looked down on this sworn brother and went to make connections with the prime minister and the book family.
    I looked at him from behind. He stood on the hillside covered with sunshine, the land blooming piece by piece under his paddle, his tall back set against the blue space, particularly clear. Like a big thick pillar, supporting the blue sky and the earth. This comparison made me so small!
    From that morning, I desperately made up my mind to truly be friends with Liu Jinkuan and the others, and to truly be happy with them and not be lonely anymore. Actually, after that, I felt much more relaxed in Liu Village. Eating, talking, washing my face, and brushing my teeth no longer felt like carrying a heavy burden. You know, a charity giver and a poor person receiving charity cannot become friends. When I started to feel like one of them in Liu Village, I started to be happy. (To be continued)

　　三个朋友
    韦君宜
    “老朋友！你刚从北平来吗？八年不见，如果在街上碰见，真是彼此都不敢认了，不要惊奇，你看我这副样子，象不象你们那里的清道夫？
    你问我这十年来的变化吗？那真是一部二十四史，从何说起？
    也别把我们解放区人捧得太高，叫我脸红，当初咱们谁还不是一样？谁都是一点一点变。说跟我学可不敢当。——要你问我的良师益友么，我可没有什么伟大人物的惊人事迹可以告诉你，我的朋友也是平凡的人，变也是平凡的变，也好，我就随便说一段。
    四三年我刚刚下乡，住在刘家庄新选的劳动英雄刘金宽家。我在这村庄里有过三个朋友，三个人三样，一个知识分子，一个绅士，还有一个是农民。
    先说这农民朋友，就是我的房东刘金宽。一开始去，我和他自然说不上朋友，住在那里，自己当觉着好象上西天取经的唐三藏似的，为了要成正果，只好咬着牙去受罪吃苦，去熬过那九九八十一难。我每天尽我所能的想办法和他们在生活上打成一片，想使他们不看外我。除了做工作，我天天跟他们上山，用心去了解什么“直谷”、“志谷”、“安种谷”……。自从下乡，几个月就没剃过胡子。刘金宽女人回娘家去了，我就躺着和他住到一个炕上：刘家的驴草完了，我帮他们铡草，他家院子脏了，我替他们扫院。临下乡以前，故意连一本文艺书也不敢带。甚至因为刘老太婆天天用诧异的眼睛看我刷牙，我觉察了，就连牙都不敢刷了。
    你也不能说我在那里整天都象充军似的，我也和他们一起说说笑笑，刘老太婆的母鸡开始抱窝，我拿着第一只小鸡，跑着笑着去送给他们看。驴子吃草忽然吃多了，我也能高兴的和他们谈论一整晚上，有一个时期，连我自己也几乎相信我真的完全改变了。——但是不行！挖土担粪我全不怕，只有咬牙就能成，只有一点终归骗不了自己，心里总好象有一块不能侵犯的小小空隙，一放开工作，一丢下锄头，那空隙就慢慢扩大起来，变成一股真正的寂寞，更禁不住外界一点刺激。好象靠抢替考了一百分的小学生，一当堂试验就露了马脚。
    就说有一回，我接到一个远方女友的信。信上说：成都的情调象北平，深巷里听到卖花声。她问：“你呢？”接信以后的几天，使我的寂寞感达到了最高度。一个下午，我独自蹲在刘家院里的石槽旁边，望着墙外那渐渐朦胧的树梢，试听听看吧——院子里的石碾子发出极沉重的吱唔吱唔声音，那是刘老太婆拉着碾子在压黑豆钱钱，粗麻绳套在她肩膀上，接着刘金宽的女人站在院心发出一声长吼：“尔唠唠唠唠……”立刻一口大黑母猪带着一群小猪直冲到我身边的石槽上来吃食，大猪叫道：“＠＠＠”小猪叫道“吱吱吱”！这现实环境和那信简直是个极具讽刺性的对比。我禁不住轻轻的“＠”了一声！刘金宽正走了过来，偏偏听见了。他就说：“老吴你愁什么——噢！一定又愁咱们少下的那只猪娃子了。”于是他就告诉我。后晌她们寻着了它，原来它跌在毛坑里，闷成了一个屎圪蛋。不知还能活不。刘老太婆和刘金宽女人也都接过口来，这一个黄昏，她们全家老小就只在谈论那掉在毛坑里的小猪，吃饭也在谈，做活也在谈，我本来知道，我应该随着一起谈的，但是那寂寞既经来了，就不肯去，越扩越大，象一块石磨一样压住我的心思，我一言不发的吃饭，连饭都吃得很少。放下饭碗，背着手走到院心，在这阵寂寞的袭击之下，我把别的道理一下子都忘了。心里堵着一个念头“即使是唐三藏取经，路上也得歇歇腿。就随便有个什么地方让我散荡散荡也好啊！”真真凑巧，正在这时候，村长忽然跑进门来招呼我，说专署今天又派了一个知识分子干部到刘家庄来了。
    那个人叫罗平，是做经济工作的，我在城里认识他，但是一点也不熟。老实说，我还有点那家伙“嘻嘻嘻哈哈哈”一套敷衍应酬的作风。但是不知道什么缘故，这一下我听到他来，高兴得好象孤身一人在遥远寂寞的异乡遇见了至亲骨肉，好象他是我专心盼望了一个多月的唯一知己。听到消息，我立刻跳起来就一直跑到村口去欢迎他，替他背挂包，扛行李，拉着手跑进村来。我招呼他吃饭啊，喝水啊，洗脚啊，当天晚上我特别跑到村合作社去和他睡在一起，东问西问城里的情形。我把我自己所知道的刘家庄情形，干部、劳动英雄、风俗人情，甚至我个人的生活情况全都告诉了他。他跟我讲讲城里最近开的美术展览会，新来的外国人以至某某人的恋爱纠纷等等。我觉得这些东西到了我的耳朵里真惯熟真滑溜，好象这些才是我自己那个世界里的东西。不知不觉就谈到快鸡叫才合眼。
    和他扯的时候我很高兴，脑子里无障无碍什么也没想，一直到合上眼以后，朦朦胧胧，突然一个念头跳到我的意识中间，这晚上的情景忽然使我联想到三七年流亡在汉口，曾有过依稀相象的感觉，——朋友！你还记得吗？那一次看电影，我告诉你的一句话，我说：“一进了这淡蓝色墙壁的电影院，电灯一暗，银幕一闪，音乐台前爵士乐的调子铿铿锵锵奏起来，我就感觉一种说不出的熟悉的气氛，好象脱离了这个酷热而生疏的汉口，回到自己原来熟惯的一个优美安适的世界。”这句旧话在刘家庄半夜里涌现出来。我猛然觉得好象有一个人站在黑暗地方比着手势嘲讽我，那个人在笑：“哈哈！嘿嘿！你原来还是老样子！”我真觉得没有地方可以躲开他的嘲笑。
    我真还是老样子吗？——可不是！到了这时候，寂寞也排遣完了。自己睡在这个生地方，想起刘金宽家不定怎么等我找我呢，倒觉得自己好象一个开小差的兵似的，难受了整整一夜，在合作社那床上怎样也睡不着。第二天一大早，我红着脸跑回刘金宽家去，这一天帮他们做活做得格外卖力。
    我跟刘金宽的变工组上山去种谷子。刘金开和王相如一组，我和刘金宽一组，他耕行子，我跟在后面拿粪点籽。谷雨过后的小春风，在山上荡来荡去。一个山峁接一个山峁，象被风掀动的大浪。谷子地旁边的麦苗已经有三四寸高，漾起一层翠绿的小波纹，一波赶着一波。我鼻子使劲一吸，肺里立刻充满了旁无清新的大气。再长长的呼出一口去。刘金宽在前边听见了，回头问我：“老吴怎么了？为甚又长出气？”我说：“没什么？我觉着这地里怪美的，景致多好！”他说：“是啊！今年地里壤气实在好。你看那片麦地，齐格蓬蓬满山绿，保险请你老吴吃好面啦！”我赶紧也转过话头谈起庄稼来，他耕得很深，含着湿气的黑土翻起来，埋过我的脚面。土里好象有一股饱满温热的香味，也给翻了出来，闻着很舒服。太阳升高了，我出了汗，一上来那份不安才渐渐消失下去。我自己问自己：“我在这个红太阳绿麦田的世界里不也很快乐吗？这也是我的世界，为甚么总留恋那个淡蓝色墙壁的世界呢？为什么不能拿刘金宽当做我的知心朋友呢？为什么……”——一面出汗一面想，两人越耕越快，一会儿就赶上了前面的王相如和刘金开。听见王相如刘金开正在议论着刘金宽赶的地垧数实在，不象陈发兴虚报垧数，对减租又是明减暗不减。
    刘金宽忽然大有感触的挺起胸来，大声说：“那谁还不知道？他从别人手里租黄家七垧地，现在又成了五垧，这是图瞒哄自己庄上人，还是图瞒哄老吴？看人家老吴起早晚睡替咱谋虑，跟咱上地受苦，心眼里全是为咱嘛！昨晚上因为我的猪娃子跌在毛坑里，老吴愁得饭都吃不下，就是自家老人，自家亲兄弟，看能不能赶上老吴这样待咱们亲？”
    我脸上猛然一发烫。他这句话正撞上我心里自怨自艾的念头。我不说你自然也知道，我到那里本是专为去向他们进行教育的，尽管和刘金宽天天在一起，吃在一起，住在一起，但他在我心里的地位，只是我的一个工作对象，是许多对象中间的一个，犹如满山高粱中间的一根。但是，他对于我却正相反。他真把我当成知心朋友看。或者说比知心朋友还要高一层。我刚到时候，刘老太婆曾经告诉过我，刘金宽那年是四十六岁，他家连租地带自地一共十五垧，但是刘金宽后来却对我说：他其实只有三十七岁，地亩也还多着七垧，他说他妈谎报，她太落后，相信别人的造谣，怕前怕后，怕我们要拔过去做公家人，她又相信地主黄四爷是恩人，不愿意减租。此外，我还从他嘴里知道了他一辈子的几件奇耻大辱。——黄四爷十九岁的小老婆打过他的嘴巴，小少爷拿他当过马骑……等等。我早就看得出刘金宽是一个很要强不低头的人，这样事怕很少和人谈过吧，但是却拿来和我这个相识只有两个月，过去生活大差地远的人来谈。他这样曾使我很惶惑，特别是那晚上我为了逃避寂寞跑去找了罗平，第二天反倒在山上听见刘金宽这些夸我的话（还说我为他愁呢！）我真觉得他比骂我还利害。从这一个由头，勾起我想到刘金宽平日待我那些情形。我在自己心里暗暗评量：假如我妈也在解放区，她若是不愿意减租，或偷偷埋怨革命等等，我能把这些事都告诉刘金宽这样的人不能？——不能够！这简直不可想象！我一向自负是心地最纯厚的人，只会自己吃亏，没做过亏负人的事。但是，这时在刘金宽的面前，突然使我感觉到，自己有点象旧小说里写的那种负义之徒，人家待他义重如山，向他托妻寄子，他却看不起这八拜之交，另外去和宰相尚书家里攀结亲眷了。
    我从后面看着他。他站在铺满阳光的山坡上，土地在他的浆子底下一片片开花，高大的背影衬在碧青的空间，格外显明。好象一根大粗柱子，在青天和大地中间撑着。这一比，比得我多小啊！
    从那早上，我拼命的下了决心，要真心和刘金宽他们做朋友，和他们在一起要真能快乐，不再寂寞。实在的，以后我在刘家庄觉着心上轻松多了。吃饭说话洗脸刷牙，不再觉得象背着一个重担，你知道，一个施粥的慈善家和受施舍的穷人，是没有办法成为朋友的。我在刘家庄，开始觉得自己是他们中间的一个的时候，我就开始快乐起来了。（未完待续）
