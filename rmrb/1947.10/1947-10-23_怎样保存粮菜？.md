　　How to Preserve Grain and Vegetables?
    To prevent stored grains and vegetables from fermenting, rotting, being eaten by insects, or losing their original flavor, the following points must be observed:
    Taking millet as an example for grain, the millet itself must be dry, dry enough to break easily when bitten with teeth, and not sticky. The storage place must be dry, waterproof, and not prone to dampness. Dark cellars should be baked with a stove (people should not be in the cellar during baking to avoid suffocation). When storing, use water-absorbent materials such as ash, sand, artemisia, and stalks to protect it. The millet to be stored should be carefully selected, without insect damage or impurities, and should not be stored with old grain. The storage place should be cool and well-ventilated. After storage, check it every one or two months. If it is damp, dry it in the sun. If it is rotten, take it out. If insects appear, freeze the grain overnight. To avoid further losses, cooking and frying the grain that is about to spoil to make fried noodles is also a good solution.
    Taking potatoes as an example for vegetables, after harvesting, the potatoes should be dried in the shade for four to five days, until the surface feels dry to the touch. A cellar is the best storage place, although it does not need to be too dry, but it cannot be too wet either. A well-drained, sunny slope is suitable. The size of the cellar depends on the amount of potatoes. Surround the potatoes with dry artemisia stalks and dry sand, and cover the top with more than a foot of soil to prevent freezing. The potatoes to be stored must be strictly selected, and those with wounds, insect damage, blackened skin, or soft, rotten interiors cannot be stored. These problematic potatoes should be cut into slices and dried in the sun for storage, or ground into flour and stored after drying, otherwise the losses will be greater. The storage place should not be too cold or too hot, especially for those kept as seeds. If it is too hot, they will sprout. To test the temperature in the cellar, place a basin of water at the entrance of the cellar. When checking, if you see the water freezing, it proves that it is too cold and you should try to keep it warm. If you are sweating while working in the cellar wearing cotton clothes, it proves that it is too hot. If you find any of the above-mentioned abnormal potatoes during inspection, you should also take them out immediately. In addition, rodents such as house mice and yellow rats are also harmful to stored grain and vegetables, so the storage place must be sealed. (Ma Lin)

　　怎样保存粮菜？
    储存的粮食、蔬菜，要他不发酵不腐烂，不虫吃不失原来味道，必须注意下列几件事：
    粮食以小米举例来说，本身要干燥，要干到用牙一咬就碎，不发勒皮的程度。储藏地方要干燥不透水不反潮的地方。暗窖要炉烤（炉烤时人不要在窖里，以免被窒息死）。储藏时用灰、砂、蒿、杆等吸水的东西保护起来，储存的小米要加以选择，有虫伤的不要，不干净的也不要，并且不要同陈粮食存在一起。储存地方要冷，要通空气。存后要隔一两个月检查一次，潮湿了晒干，有烂了的取出，若生了虫，把粮食拿出来冻一夜。为了避免损失扩大，把将坏的粮食取出炒熟做炒面，也是办法。
    蔬菜以山药蛋举例来说，收获以后的山药蛋要阴干四五天，干到用手摸表皮不觉有潮湿气的程度。储藏地方以地窖最好，虽然不必太干，但也不能太湿，排水好向阳的坡地适宜，地窖大小要看山药蛋多少来定，四周用蒿杆干砂围起来，顶上要覆一尺多的土，以免结冻。要存的山药蛋须严格选择，有创伤的、有虫伤的，皮发黑的，内部发软已经腐烂的，都不能存。这些有毛病的山药蛋，应赶紧切成片晒干储藏，或晒干后磨成面储藏，不然损失更大。储存地方太冷与太热都不相宜，尤其对留作种籽的，太热了便生芽了。测验地窖中的温度，可在地窖入口放一盆水，去检查时，若见水结冰，证明太冷了，应想法保温。若在窖内穿着棉衣工作而流汗，证明太热了。检查时发现上述不正常山药蛋，也应赶紧取出。此外，危害存粮与蔬菜的，还有家鼠，黄鼠等动物，储藏地方要严密。（马琳）
