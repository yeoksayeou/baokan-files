　　Women's Mutual Aid Group in Zhengzhao Village
　　Kuí Lín
　　Women in Shahe's Zhengzhao Village began organizing mutual aid groups in May, but at the time, the women were afraid that mutual aid would restrict their freedom and that they wouldn't be able to withdraw. Some said that if they engaged in mutual aid, they wouldn't be able to do their housework; others said that if they engaged in mutual aid, they wouldn't get enough to eat. The chairman, Li Biàn de, the captain, Ma Yínzhī, and the squad leader, Qí Quē de, first formed a cadre group, and began mutual aid in the fields, watering seedlings and fighting locusts. The weather was hot, and after watering the fields twice and weeding once in just a few days, Ma Yínzhī fell ill. After the locust fight, women like Xiǎo Duō, Xìngzhī, and Zàn de received awards, and the chairman and Qí Quē de decided to lead a group. Quē de and her grandmother planted three mu of paddy fields, and only planted wheat on the day before the Beginning of Winter last year, which only yielded four dou this year, making their lives very difficult. Because of the lack of labor for farming, her need for mutual aid was most urgent. She first approached Luo Lián de and said, "Your husband is not at home, and we don't have male labor in my family either. Others can still manage without mutual aid, but if we don't have mutual aid, we'll have even more trouble farming." Subsequently, the chairman also approached Xiǎng de and Fèng de, and the five of them formed a group (Xiǎng de and Biàn de were both military dependents). At that time, it was very dry, so they engaged in mutual aid to water and weed the seedlings. All the wells and waterwheels were constantly in use. Quē de's and Mí de's fields couldn't be watered during the day, so their group watered them at night. Mí de and Quē de also watered their fields during the day or night. At first, they watered slowly, not as well as the men, and the men laughed and said, "Look at the way they are, they really can't stand being idle, just wasting effort!" But they ignored the men's laughter and kept working. One night, they used a waterwheel and two windlasses to water the fields. The water was too much, and the ditch collapsed, and the water flowed into a pit where a tree had been dug up by the side of the ditch. Biàn de went to block the opening and her foot got stuck in a foot-deep hole. It was dark, and she was scared, so Biàn de started to cry. Quē de helped her pull her foot out, and then went to help her block the water, and they continued to water. In nine days, they watered for seven whole nights. One day, the five of them used four windlasses to water six mu of land in a day and a night. They never lost heart, watering at night and weeding during the day. This is how they worked all summer. Mí de's five mu of paddy fields and Quē de's three mu of paddy fields didn't cost them any wages from watering to weeding. Fèng de and Biàn de had more land and didn't need any short-term labor. During this period, they exchanged labor, without distinguishing between the quality of labor. After calculating the accounts, in addition to compensating for labor, Mí de owed Quē de three and a half days of work, and Fèng de owed one and a half days. At the same time as her group, there was only Kūn de's group, with Xìn de, Xiāng de's mother, and others, who also often helped each other water and weed the seedlings.
　　After the summer's weeding and watering, the people in the two groups talked more and more to each other, and they were more familiar with doing work together. During the autumn harvest, their mutual aid was even better than before. They assessed labor for reaping grain and gathering stubble, and set wages for threshing grain according to the amount. Quē de had the best labor, and was faster than men in reaping grain and gathering stubble. Everyone assessed that she earned six and a half jin a day (men only earned six jin). Quē de only wanted six jin, Biàn de and Mí de each earned five or five and a half jin, and Fèng de and Xiǎng de earned four or four and a half jin. It was also a flexible application of rigid rules. The daily work was arranged by the heads of the families (those with elderly people, such as Biàn de and Fèng de), and the village constantly praised her group. Pán Yúnniáng (also a military dependent) was envious and said to the chairman, "Everyone says your group is good, I don't know if it will work for me to join?" Quē de and the chairman immediately accepted her. She and Quē de steamed the dry rations every evening, and the next day the children or neighbors brought some soup, and they still went to the fields with the others. Mí de said, "We just have so much work, we won't feel relieved until we've finished it." Quē de said, "It's the same whether we earn wages or not, so I say we should work harder." After they finished the autumn harvest, they also reaped beans for Guì de, exchanging labor for her to plow the fields. This autumn, Quē de harvested more than four bags of corn and one stone of grain, because the seedlings were watered well and weeded well. She also planted buckwheat on three mu of dry land, which grew very well. She said, "This winter, I'll do a good job of spinning and weaving, and I won't be afraid of anything in life next year." Mí de also harvested enough grain to eat.
　　During the autumn harvest campaign, the women in each street challenged each other, and mutual aid groups were universally established. After Ma Yínzhī recovered from her illness, she led another group herself. She slept with the women's chairman, and in order to catch up with the chairman's group, she got up before dawn without waking the chairman, and quietly went to the fields. Zhāng Shě de in Wáng Duō's group was from a poor family in the past and had been constantly working in the fields, but at that time she worked for herself, and also did a lot of work for others, and she constantly cried. Now she said to Wáng Duō, "In the old society, I suffered every day, and still didn't have enough to eat. Now that we have it, the grain we harvest is put into our own circle, it can't be the same as before!" Now she is even happier to engage in mutual aid, working in the fields during the day and weaving cloth at night. Hóu Sù de's group, four women and two children, were just as good as full laborers in reaping grain and gathering stubble. They reaped in the morning, ate lunch, and the men went to thresh. The stubble reaped in the morning was threshed in the afternoon, so the men, women, laborers, and children were all very satisfied. The whole village only planted thirteen qing of wheat last year, but this year it will plant more than thirty-one qing. They planted in time and did a good job, and everyone said, "We'll be able to eat more white steamed buns next year!"

　　正招村的妇女互助组
    奎林
    沙河正招村在五月间就开始组织妇女互助，但当时妇女们怕互助起来不自由，不能退出。有的说互助起来，俺家里的活就不能做了；有的说互助起来，俺就吃不到嘴里饭了。主席李便的、队长马银枝和分队长齐缺的就先成起了一个干部小组，先上地里互助浇苗，又打蝗虫，天又热，不几天浇了两次地锄了一次苗，马银枝就病了。在打蝗以后，小多、杏枝、赞的等妇女得了奖，主席和齐缺的就决心带领一个组。缺的和他奶奶种三亩水地，去年立冬前一天才种上麦，今年只打了四斗，生活很困难，种地没劳力要求互助最迫切，她先找见罗连的说：“你男人不在家，我家也没男劳力，人家不互助吧还能干，咱不互助，种地可就更发愁了。”随后主席又找了想的、凤的，五个人便成了组（想的、便的都是军属）。当时天很旱，她们就互助浇苗和锄苗，那时候全部的井和水车都不住的浇，缺的、迷的的地，白天轮不着浇，她们小组就夜里给她浇，迷的和缺的白天或夜里也给她们浇，浇了地又锄苗。开头她们浇的慢，不如男人，男人们就笑话说：“看她们那样子，真是闲不住了，光白误工哩！”但是她们不管男人们的笑话，一直的干。有一晚上，用了一辆水车和两个辘辘浇，水大了，水沟崩了，水流在水沟边一个刨过树的土坑里，便的去挡口子，把脚一下子陷进一尺多深，天又黑，心里又害怕，便的就哭起来，缺的帮助她拔出脚来，又去和她把水挡好，还是浇。九天内，就浇了七个整夜。有一天五个人用了四个辘辘，一天一夜浇了六亩地。他们一直没有灰过心，晚上浇了，白天就锄，就这样干了一夏天，迷的的五亩水地和缺的的三亩水地连浇带锄都没出工资。凤的、便的地多，也没用过短工。这一时期她们是工换工，劳力不分好歹，算了算帐，除顶了工以外，迷的欠缺的三天半工，凤的欠一天半。和她组同时搞起来的只有坤的组，有信的、香的娘等几个人，也是经常的互助浇地锄苗。
    经过夏天的锄苗浇地，她们两组的人在一起更说到一块了，做活也熟悉的多了，在秋收中她们互助的就更比前好了。割谷、搂茬都按劳力评了工，切谷按数规定工资，缺的劳力最好，割谷、搂茬比男人还快，大家评他一天赚六斤半（男人才六斤），缺的只要六斤，便的、迷的两人五斤或五斤半，凤的、想的四斤或四斤半，又是死分活用，每天的活是家长们给安排（有老人的如便的、凤的），村里不断的表扬她组。盘云娘（也是军属）眼气了向主席说：“人家都说你组好，俺参加不知行不行？”缺的和主席马上就吸收了她，她和缺的每天黄昏先把干粮蒸好，第二天由小孩或邻家带做点汤，还是和别人一起下地。迷的说：“咱就是这么些活，几时能做完了咱才能心净哩。”缺的说：“多做点赚点工资也是一天，咱不干出些工资也是一天，叫我说咱就干急些才好。”他两人收完秋后，又给贵的割了豆子，换下工给她们犁地。缺的今年秋天，因苗子浇的到，锄的好，打了四布袋多玉茭一石谷子，还有三亩旱地种了荞麦，长的也很好，她说：“今年冬天再好好纺织，明年生活就啥也不怕了。”迷的打的粮食也够吃了。
    秋收运动中，各街妇女们互相挑战，互助组就普遍成立起来。马银枝病好以后，自己又带领了一个小组，她和妇女主席在一起睡，为了赶上主席组，她五更起来不叫主席，悄悄就往地里走了，王多的组内张舍的，过去穷家出身，就不断下过地，但那时光自己干，又是多给人家做活，自己也不断的哭，现在她和王多的说：“咱在旧社会里，每天受个死，还是没吃的，现在咱有了，收下粮食就打到咱的自己圈里，还能和过去一样哩！”现在又互助起来干，更高兴了，白天下地，夜里还要织布。侯素的组，四个妇女两个儿童，割谷、搂茬一样顶住整劳力，她们割一早晨，吃了饭，男人们就去＠，午前割的又供上午后＠，第一天＠了茬第二天就犁，因此男女劳力和儿童都很满意。全村去年只种了十三顷麦，今年要种三十一顷多。又应时、又垧好，都说：“明年可多吃白馍馍吧！”
