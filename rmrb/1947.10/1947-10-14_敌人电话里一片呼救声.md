　　Celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival by Seizing Cities and Eliminating Enemies
  　Enemy Telephone Filled with Cries for Help
    Yue Qiao
    On the night of September 28th, precisely the Mid-Autumn Festival according to the lunar calendar, taking advantage of the bright moonlight, our army began a courageous advance on the Beining Railway, a hundred miles east of Shanhaiguan. The soldiers agreed that they would celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival on the Beining Railway. At about 10 o'clock at night, the sound of artillery fire rang out. Our army captured and annihilated the enemies in Gaoling Village in one fell swoop, occupying the enemy's company headquarters. The company political instructor picked up the enemy's telephone, and it was filled with cries for help, a truly lively scene.
    "Hello: Telephone squad! Telephone squad! Connect the line..." Before he could finish speaking, another shouted: "Connect the line! Connect to Shanhaiguan! We are the advance detachment, the deputy commander is wounded, we can't hold on..." Another location anxiously said: "What's going on! Hurry up!" Another seemed to reply: "We are under heavy fire here, there's no one..."
    The political instructor deliberately said into the phone: "Telephone squad: Connect the line quickly! Gaoling station can't be defended, the Eighth Route Army has already entered the street! Hurry!" A flustered reply came from the phone: "Don't rush, there are too many, we can't manage..." Suddenly, with a "scratch" sound, the telephone line was cut off. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

　　夺城歼敌欢度中秋
  　敌人电话里一片呼救声
    岳桥
    九月二十八日的夜晚，正是旧历中秋节，趁月光如昼，我军开始向山海关东侧百里的北宁线上勇猛进军，战士们相约一定在北宁路上欢度中秋。夜十点钟左右，炮声响了，我军一连一举歼俘了高岭村内的敌人，占领敌人中队部，连指导员拿起敌人的电话机一听，里面一片呼救声真是热闹。
    “喂：电话班！电话班！接线……”这一个没说完，那一个就喊：“接线！接山海关！我们是前所大队，大队副负伤了，顶不住了……”又一处着了急说：“怎么回事！赶快吧！”另一处似乎回答：“我们这边打的紧，没有人……”
    指导员还故意在电话里说：“电话班：快接线！高岭站守不住了，八路军已经进了街！要快！”电话里发出慌忙的回答：“不要忙，太多了，来不及……”忽然刮的一声，电线断了。（新华社电稿）
