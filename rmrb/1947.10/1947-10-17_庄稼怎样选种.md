　　II. How to Identify Good and Bad Seeds
　　II. Corn kernels should be long, deep yellow in color, with thin skin. The cob should be eight inches or more in length, with a thin core. The difference between the top and bottom of the cob should not be too large. The tip of the cob should not expose the core. The entire cob should have around seventeen or eighteen rows of kernels, with each row neatly arranged. The part of the cob closest to the root is the earliest maturing variety and should be free from smut disease.
　　III. Golden Queen Corn. Rows and kernels should be neatly arranged with narrow row grooves. The kernels should be free from insects and disease, flat and long with a deep groove on top, light yellow in color. The cob should be roughly the same thickness at both ends, with a red and thin tassel.
　　IV. Sorghum. Grains should be large, with a small outer husk that is easy to thresh. Stalks should be long and upright, without "red spots." The head should be large with heavy grains, free from mold, and the grain color should be bright.
　　V. Soybeans (black, yellow, and green varieties). Grains should be round, with each pod containing at least three grains of uniform size. The entire plant should produce eighty or more pods, all maturing at the same time.
　　VI. Potatoes. The skin color should be correct, bright purple for purple varieties and pure white for white varieties, with sparse eyes and a regular oblong shape. Avoid oddly shaped or clustered small pieces. Each plant should have five or six potatoes of roughly the same size, each weighing about four ounces. Avoid rotten potatoes or those with "fire dragon" disease.
　　VII. Pumpkins. Should be flat and round with ridges, with clear and shallow grooves between the ridges. The skin color should be earthy yellow, and the stem should be recessed. The flesh should be deep yellow, firm, and thick, with small seeds. Pumpkins that set closer to the root are the earliest maturing varieties.

    二、如何识别好坏种籽
    二、玉茭籽粒长，颜色深黄，皮薄，穗长八寸以上，穗轴细，穗头穗尾差别不太大，穗尖不露穗轴，全穗籽粒在十七八行左右，各行排列整齐，轴穗部分愈靠近根部愈是早熟种，没有乌霉病。
    三、金皇后玉茭。行粒整齐，行沟窄，没虫没病，籽粒扁长顶上有深圪道。粒浅黄，穗两头粗细差不多，骨朵红而细的。
    四、高粱。粒籽大，外谷小容易脱粒。秆长而直立，没有“红斑”，穗大粒重，没霉，粒色鲜明。
    五、大豆（黑黄青豆三种）。籽粒圆，每个荚至少有三粒籽实并且大小一律。全棵结八十个荚以上，并且成熟期一律。
    六、山药蛋。皮色正，紫的鲜紫，白的洁白，芽眼稀，形状成正规长圆形。不要奇形怪状与连生零星小块的。每株有五六个差不多一般大的，每个重四两左右，不要烂的，也不要生“火龙”病的。
    七、南瓜。扁圆有楞，楞与楞中间有明鲜沟浅，皮色土黄，瓜柄向下陷。肉色深黄坚厚，籽粒小。结瓜部位愈靠近根部愈是早熟种。
