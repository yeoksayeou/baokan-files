　　Border Region Government Organs Squeeze Out Feudalism
  　Unite with Village Residents to Struggle Against Hidden Landlords

　　[Reported by our newspaper] The class investigation, thought investigation, and feudalism squeezing movement in the Border Region government organs has entered a climax. On the 12th of last month, government personnel and resident villagers jointly convened a meeting to struggle against Cheng Kungang, a landlord who had infiltrated the production store of the Border Region government. He was removed from his position and handed over to the villagers of his village for handling. Cheng Kungang was one of the notorious local bullies and landlords in Pingxiang County, Southern Hebei. Because his family had lived in the yamen (government office) for three generations and had money and power, the Cheng family was "well-known" in Pingxiang County. During the enemy and puppet regime, Cheng served as a puppet army administrator, using his power to forcibly marry a good woman from a disaster-stricken family as his second wife. During the counter-offensive, Cheng fled with the enemy and was captured by us on the way. After the liberation of Pingxiang, Cheng was struggled against by the masses three times, and later infiltrated the production organ of the Border Region government. In his work, he consistently showed procrastination and perfunctoriness. He was polite to cadres but bad-tempered towards miscellaneous workers, most of whom were from poor backgrounds, which caused dissatisfaction among the miscellaneous workers who said, "Poor people can't get ahead." When Cheng's second wife gave birth, he had the landlord serve him and do the cooking and laundry without compensation, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. During the land reform study in the organs, Cheng Kungang avoided talking about the crimes of his family and said that he was a "good person," that his father's coercion of a civilian woman was because the "woman was bad," and that his two wives were "mutually willing." He believed that the struggle against him by the masses was "unjust" and "excessive," that he was a "poor peasant" and should be compensated. He said that the crimes of his family were a "social problem." At the meeting, Cheng continued to use cunning methods to evade responsibility. The women of the village residents pointed at Cheng Kungang and said, "Why do you have two wives?! Isn't it because you have money to oppress people!" Cheng argued, "I exchanged five dou of rice for them!" This aroused the crowd, who beat him. Finally, it was decided to squeeze Cheng out of the government and hand him over to the masses for handling. After the meeting, the resident villagers discussed that the government belongs to us poor people, and landlords cannot hide anywhere. (Xiu Shan)

　　[Reported by our newspaper] Wu Xusheng, a landlord from Longquan, Wu'an, evaded the struggle of the masses and infiltrated the organs of the Border Region government. During the land reform last year, he dared not return home to be liquidated due to his guilt, and secretly transported several bundles of belongings from his home for sale. Before this Three Check-ups movement, Wu Xusheng used his illness as an excuse, and took advantage of the fact that the masses in Wu'an were busy planting wheat to return home to evade the Three Check-ups. After returning home, he was immediately detained and struggled against by the masses. Upon hearing this, the Border Region government immediately sent a letter to the villagers, announcing the dismissal of Wu Xusheng and detailing his various behaviors in the Border Region government. His shares deposited in the store were also handed over to the masses for handling. After receiving the letter, the masses held a village-wide meeting to announce the government's attitude, and the masses were extremely excited. (Xiu Shan)

　　边府机关挤查封建
  　联合驻村群众斗争隐藏地主
    【本报讯】边府机关查阶级查思想挤封建运动进入高潮。上月十二日机关人员与驻村群众联合召集大会，斗争混入边府机关生产商店地主程昆岗，革除其职务送交本村群众处理。程昆岗系冀南平乡城内有名恶霸地主之一，因其家庭三辈住衙门，有钱有势，所以程家在平乡县“赫赫有名”。敌伪统治时程曾任伪军管理员，仗势强娶灾民良女为二老婆。在反攻时，程随敌逃跑，中途被我俘获。平乡解放后，程曾被群众斗争过三次，后混入边府生产机关。在工作中一贯表现推诿、敷衍，对干部客气，对杂务人员发脾气，而杂务人员绝大部分出身贫苦，引起杂务人员不满说：“穷人吃不开”。程之二老婆生孩子时，无代价的让房东侍候，做饭洗裤子，引起群众不满。机关土改学习时，程昆岗对于家庭罪恶成份，避而不谈，说自己是“好人”，父亲霸占民女是“女人坏”，个人两个老婆是“双方情愿”。对于群众的斗争，他认为“冤屈”“过火”，自己是“贫农”应该给他填补。说家庭有罪是“社会问题”。大会上程仍以狡猾手段推卸责任，驻村群众妇女指着程昆岗说：“你凭什么两个老婆？！还不是有钱压迫人！”程狡辩“我五斗米换的！”致群情激昂，群起殴打。最后决定将程挤出政府交群众处理。会后驻村群众纷纷议论，政府是我们穷人的，地主跑到那里也躲不了。（秀山）
    【本报讯】武安龙泉地主武序盛，躲避群众斗争，混入边府机关，在去年一年的土改中，畏罪不敢回去被清算，并偷偷的将家里包袱数个运出拍卖。此次三查前武序盛借身体有病，又趁武安群众忙于种麦生产时节回家躲避三查，回家后即被群众扣留斗争。边府闻讯，当即致函该村群众，宣布革除武序盛职务，并将其在边府之各种表现，详细介绍，其存放于商店之股金也交群众处理。群众接信后，曾召开全村大会，宣布政府态度，群众兴奋万分。（秀山）
