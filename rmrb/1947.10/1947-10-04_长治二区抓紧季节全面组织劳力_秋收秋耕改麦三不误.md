　　Changzhi Second District Grasps the Season to Comprehensively Organize Labor Force
  　Autumn Harvest, Autumn Planting, and Wheat Conversion Without Delay
    [This newspaper Changzhi News] The Second District held an emergency mobilization meeting of village cadres on the 21st of last month to arrange for the autumn harvest and autumn planting. Guo, the branch secretary, pointed out: There has been excessive rainfall this autumn, and the frost and ground freeze will come early. We should be vigilant and start early to fight against the seasonal natural disasters, comprehensively organize, and fully carry out the autumn harvest, autumn planting, and wheat conversion movement. We must achieve the three "no delays": harvest as soon as it ripens, plow as soon as it's harvested, and convert to planting immediately. He also emphasized that we must overcome the habitual ideas of emphasizing sideline occupations over agriculture and the paralysis of harvesting before plowing. Then, the following three questions were raised: (1) How to get through ideologically? During the discussion, two different ideas were discovered: Some had positive ideas such as: The government's call is correct, this work is very intense, seize the autumn and grab the wheat, diligence makes the land not lazy, and autumn harvest is like snatching food from a tiger's mouth. However, some had paralyzed and waiting ideas such as: "Eighty percent of the harvest depends on good weather, snatching planting but not snatching harvest" and "Don't worry about planting as long as there's wheat at home, regardless of when the stars fall or the ground freezes." After repeated debates, the actual experience of the masses overcame negative ideas. For example, Dongxiahao Village stated: This year, our village suffered losses from not listening to the district's call and being paralyzed. We harvested one day late, and the crops were hit by "cold eggs" (a local term for a type of frost), and we didn't even dare to report the disaster to the district. One "cold egg" incident broke through the ideological barriers of the masses in our village. Bi Eryun said: Autumn plowing is very important. Someone said: This year, an ox's footprint is equivalent to ten strokes of a hoe next year. After discussion, everyone agreed that those incorrect sayings from habit must be overcome. (2) How to comprehensively organize and fully carry out the autumn harvest and autumn planting? The main issue is how to specifically organize all full, semi, and auxiliary laborers. Villages exchanged experiences and further studied specific methods such as scoring points for work performed, recording work by piece, and coordinating women's work at home cooking and taking care of children with work in the fields. (3) How to achieve the three "no delays" of autumn harvest, autumn planting, and wheat conversion? The conclusion of the discussion was to harvest, plow, and convert to planting one patch at a time, without delaying any of them, and to specifically allocate tasks according to the strength of the labor force. Pay attention to the northwest wind, don't let the crops fall over and be unable to harvest, freeze and be unable to plow, or delay planting. For example, some said: Last year, autumn harvest and autumn planting were arranged in a row, and the masses were dissatisfied. But with this arrangement, the crops were not fully harvested, the wheat fields were not planted, and the land was not plowed, resulting in a "three no rush" situation. This further attracted everyone's attention. After discussion, everyone was in high spirits, and each village set out an autumn harvest plan to achieve clean fields throughout the district by September 5th, with autumn land generally plowed once. Then, small districts and villages proposed challenges and competitions, inviting the district secretary and district head to be judges, and comparing achievements at the summary meeting.

　　长治二区抓紧季节全面组织劳力
  　秋收秋耕改麦三不误
    【本报长治讯】二区上月二十一日召开全区村干部紧急动员会议布置秋收秋耕，郭分书指出：今秋雨水过多，霜打地冻要早，应警惕起来及早动手，与季节天灾作斗争，全面的组织起来，全力开展秋收秋耕改麦运动，一定要做到黄了就割，割了就犁和即时改种的三不误，并着重提出，必须克服习惯上存在着重副轻农和收了再耕的麻痹思想。接着提出以下三个问题：（一）如何打通思想？在讨论时发现两种不同思想：如有的是：政府号召就是对，这段工作很紧张，抢秋夺麦，人勤地不懒，秋收如同虎口夺食等积极思想。但有的是：十分庄稼八分收，抢种不抢收和“星不落地不冻，家里有麦只管种”等麻痹等待思想。经反复争论，以群众实际经验战胜消极思想。如东下郝村提出：今年秋收不听区号召吃亏麻痹亏，迟割了一天，让冷蛋打了，也不敢来区报灾，一场冷蛋打通了俺村群众思想。毕二云说：秋耕地很重要。有人说：今年老牛踏一脚，等于明年掘十镢。经讨论大家一致认为习惯上那些不正确说法必须克服。（二）如何全面组织起来，全力开展秋收秋耕？主要是如何把全半劳力辅劳力，具体组织，各村交流经验，进一步研究了按活评分按件记工，与妇女在家做饭看小孩和上地做活等具体办法。（三）怎样做到秋收秋耕改麦三不误？讨论结果是，黄一块割一块犁一块，那个也不能误了，并按劳力强弱具体分工。注意西北风，不要倒了割不了，冻了耕不完，误了种不上，如有的说：去年秋天秋耕排着干，群众都不满，但这一打，庄稼没有收完，麦地没有种上，地也没犁完，结果弄了个三不赶。更引起大家的注意，经过讨论大家情绪很高，各村定出秋收计划，于九月五日全区做到场光地净，秋地普遍犁一遍。接着小区与小区，村与村提出挑战竞赛，聘请区书区长作评判，总结会上见高低。（果行、振华、度五、晓光）
