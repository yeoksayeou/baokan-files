　　Door-to-door Inspections in Nanwang and Other Villages
　　Adjust Land and Expand Wheat Fields
　　[Our Newspaper, Shahe] The Sixth District, in conjunction with the Great Counter-Offensive propaganda, has stirred up a surge of production enthusiasm among the masses. The masses in various villages are demanding to plant more wheat. The masses in Ge Village said, "If we want a quick victory, we must plant more wheat." Others said, "Our fight with Chiang Kai-shek is like two people fighting; if we are fat and have strength, we can knock him down. If we want strength, we must plant more wheat." Zhengzhao Village planted 13 qing last year and wants to plant 33 qing this year. In order to universally expand wheat planting, the leadership organized an inspection in Nanwang Village to see what problems still exist in expanding wheat fields. Initially, the village cadres said, "Except for the five households of entirely female laborers who have no way, no one else in our village has difficulties. We know it without investigating." But after door-to-door inspections, the cadres were shocked. A total of 22 households of anti-Japanese orphans and widows with no labor force, totaling 76 people, were found to have 146.5 mu of land, with an average of 1.92 mu of land per person. They planted a total of 69.3 mu of wheat, accounting for 47 percent of the total land, with an average of 0.89 mu of wheat planted per person. Last year, there were six households, totaling 17 people, who did not ask for more land during the land reform because they were considered "unwilling to ask for more" and had 41 mu of land, with an average of 2.4 mu of land per person. They planted a total of 21.6 mu of wheat, accounting for 52 percent of the land, with an average of 1.28 mu of wheat planted per person. There were also 17 households who gained a lot of land during the struggle last year, totaling 42 people, with 388 mu of land, with an average of 8.4 mu of land per person. This year, they planted a total of 165 mu of wheat, accounting for 42 percent of their land, with an average of 4 mu of wheat land per person. Other ordinary people planted an average of 2 mu of wheat per person. From the above figures, although the amount of land varies, the amount of wheat planted has not reached 60 percent of the land. Some lacked labor and livestock and wanted to plant more but couldn't. For example, the family member of a soldier × did not do well in the land reform last year, so he could not plant more wheat this year. He said, "I have no livestock and no waterwheel. I can't do anything even if you give me these two mu of land." Immediately, the share of a waterwheel of a fleeing household was given to him, and he asked to plant more wheat. Some could not plant more because they had too little land. For example, Gao Shuangxi's family of nine only planted four mu of wheat, and there was no more land to plant more. Immediately, six mu of land were adjusted and given to him, and he planted five more mu of wheat. In addition, 15 households with more land could not plant it all, so they automatically adjusted 73 mu of land and gave it to households with less land to plant wheat. The whole village of 84 households planted 240 mu more wheat than originally planned. After inspection, Ge Village found that half of the land of ordinary people was plowed twice (because there were many livestock in the village). Zhang Jingxin, a family member of a soldier, had only two mu of his seven mu of wheat land plowed twice. Zhang Zhengyue had only one mu of his eight mu of wheat land plowed twice, and the family members of soldiers were not very happy. Putongdian found that seven households could not plant more because they had too little land. They reflected, "In the future, we can't live without land." Xi Cuicha had no labor force and did not participate in mutual aid. He wanted to hire short-term labor but couldn't. He had no way to plant his 4.7 mu of wheat land. Yang Sen could not plant more because of a shortage of fertilizer. Zhongwang, Zhouzhuang, Pengcui, and other villages also had such problems. The masses in Ge Village said in the discussion, "If the land has no fertilizer, we will plow and harrow it better and spend more labor. If we don't plant this year, we won't harvest next year, and we still can't afford to buy fertilizer." A widow and orphan household could not afford to hire labor, so they decided to spin cotton after planting wheat. The whole village planted 100 mu more than originally planned. In Zhongwang Village, 40 mu of land were not distributed last year and were raised by the cooperative. Now the masses are vying for it, but there is no time to distribute it, so let the cooperative unify it first. The number of workers used and the amount of wheat seeds are recorded, and whoever distributes it later will pay. The sheep and cattle fertilizer of the Changwang Village Cooperative helped the family members of soldiers and households with no labor force. Some wheat seeds were bought at the Yongnian Liuguji market, and the cooperative also solved the problem of one part and distributed the 60 mu of land (originally planted by the cooperative) that had not been distributed in the spring to households with less land, so that the masses could rush to plant wheat. After such specific solutions to difficulties, six villages, including Ge Village, Zhouzhuang, Changzhuang, Xi Cui, Nanwang, and Zhongwang, planted a total of 729 mu more than originally planned. Now, each village is still conducting in-depth door-to-door inspections and quickly solving various difficulties so that the masses can plant enough wheat. (Zheng Min, Gao Meng, Kui Lin)

　　南汪等村挨门检查
  　调剂土地扩大麦田
    【本报沙河讯】六区结合大反攻宣传，鼓起群众生产热潮，各村群众都要求多种麦子，葛村群众说：“要想胜利快，得多种麦”。又有人说：“咱和蒋介石打仗，就和两个人打架一样，咱胖，有了劲就可把他打倒，要想有劲就得多种麦子”。正招村去年种了十三顷，今年要种三十三顷。领导上为了普遍扩大种麦，特在南汪村组织检查，看扩大麦田中到底还有些什么问题。开始村干部说：“俺村除了五个全妇户没办法外，别人都没困难，不用调查也知道。”但经过挨门挨户的检查后，干部大吃了一惊。共计查出没劳力的抗敌孤寡二十二户，七十六口人，共地一百四十六亩半，每人平均土地一亩九分二，共种麦子六十九亩三，占总地亩数百分之四十七，每口人平均种麦八分九。去年翻身中因为被认为“不愿多要”地而没多要地的六户，十七口人，地四十一亩，每口人平均土地二亩四分，共种麦二十一亩六，占种地亩数百分之五十二，每口人平均种麦一亩二分八。还有十七户去年斗争厉害，得的地多，四十二人，地三百八十八亩，每人平均土地八亩四分，今年共种麦一百六十五亩，占其地亩数百分之四十二，每人平均麦地四亩。其他一般群众平均每口人种麦二亩。从以上这些数字看，虽然土地数目多少不一，种麦的数都没达到种地亩百分之六十。有的是因为劳畜力缺乏，想多种而不能，如×军属去年翻身没翻好，今年就不能多种麦，他说：“俺没牲口没水车，光给俺这二亩地俺也没办法。”当即把一户逃亡户的水车股分给了他，他就要求多种麦。有的是土地少更不能多种，如高双喜九口人只种四亩麦子，再想多种没地了，马上调剂给了他六亩地，他就多种五亩麦子。另有十五户因地较多，种不过来，自动把地调剂出来七十三亩，给了少地的户种麦。全村八十四户，多种二百四十亩麦，超过原计划。葛村经过检查后，发现一般群众的地都有一半用二犁（因该村牲口多），军属张景心的七亩麦地，只二亩无二犁，张正月八亩麦地只一亩翻二犁，军属不大痛快。普通店发现七户因地少不能多种。他们反映说：“往后没点地就是不能过。”西崔茶的原因没劳力，未参加互助，想用短工也没有，四亩七分麦地还没办法。杨森的因肥料短少不能多种。中汪、周庄、朋崔等村也都有这样的问题。葛村群众在讨论中说：“地没肥，咱犁耙好些多费点工。今年种不上，明年收不下，还是不能买肥。一孤寡户还不起工，决定种麦以后纺花。全村比原计划多种一百亩。中汪村去年四十亩地没分配下，合作社养着。现在群众都争着要，但没时间分配，就先让合作社统一，用的工数和麦种数都记上帐，等以后谁分下归谁就出。常汪村合作社的羊牛肥料帮助了军属和没劳力户，麦种在永年刘固集土买些，合作社还有一部已解决了问题，并把春天未分配了的六十亩地（原合作社种着）也分配了少地的户，让群众赶种麦子。经过这样具体的解决困难，让葛村、周庄、常庄、西崔、南汪、中汪等六村，共比原计划多种七百二十九亩。现各村仍在深入的挨户检查，并迅速解决各种困难问题，使群众都能把麦子种足。（政民、高孟、奎林）
