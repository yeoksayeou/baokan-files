Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 4th: In the great victory of the Jicha-Rehe-Liao People's Liberation Army at Yangzhangzi, Jinxi, wiping out the enemy's 49th Army, another high-ranking Kuomintang bandit officer captured has been identified as Yu Zelin, commander of the 105th Division of that army.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 4th: Frontline reporters commenting on the significant changes in enemy and our forces during the two battles of Yangzhangzi stated: In the first battle, our Liberation Army, at a cost of one-to-seven casualties, annihilated and captured over 4,300 Kuomintang bandits from the Provisional 22nd Division, part of the Provisional 50th Division, and division direct units, already breaking the Jicha-Rehe-Liao area's past ratio of enemy annihilation; while in the second battle of Yangzhangzi, our army, at a cost of less than one-to-ten, wiped out an entire army headquarters, two division headquarters, and four regiments of the Kuomintang 49th Army, totaling over 12,000 men, and successively captured high-ranking Kuomintang bandit officers such as Yu Zelin, commander of the 105th Division, Su Jingtai, deputy commander of the Provisional 22nd Division, Ning Jian, division chief of staff, Wu Zhian, director of staff of the 105th Division, Tao Huanyu, commander of the 3rd and 5th Regiments, and Dong Bochou, deputy commander of the 23rd Regiment of the 79th Division, and many other high-ranking officers. During the battle, seven scouts from one of our units captured over 400 bandits, demonstrating the increasing strength of our Jicha-Rehe-Liao People's Liberation Army. Chen Cheng's delusional attempt to use the 49th Army to "boost" the morale of the defeated Kuomintang bandits in the Northeast turned out to be a dud.

Xinhua News Agency, Jicha-Rehe-Liao, 3rd: Belated news: The Red East Sub-district, together with the detachments of Cheng, Jiandong (newly established county), Lingnan counties, and an independent regiment, cooperated with the main force in the battle of Yangzhangzi on September 16th, completing the guard duty, capturing 600 enemies, seizing 12 light and heavy machine guns, over 130 rifles, and two 60mm mortars and heavy mortars.

　　杨仗子大歼灭战中我俘匪师长于泽霖
    【新华社东北前线四日电】冀察热辽人民解放军锦西杨仗子歼敌四十九军大捷中，被俘蒋匪高级军官近又查出该军一○五师师长于泽霖一名。
    【新华社东北前线四日电】前线记者评述锦西杨仗子两战役敌我力量发生显著变化称：首次战役中，我解放军以一比七的伤亡代价，歼俘蒋匪暂二十二师、暂五十师一部及师直属队四千三百余人，即已打破了冀察热辽区过去的歼敌比率；而再战杨仗子之役，我军却以少于一比十的代价，一举歼灭蒋匪四十九军一个军部、两个师部和四个团共达一万二千余人，并先后俘获蒋匪一○五师师长于泽霖、暂二十二师副师长苏景泰、师参谋长宁坚、及一○五师参谋主任吴稚庵、三、五团团长陶寰宇、七十九师二十三团副团长董伯踌等高级军官多人。战斗中，我某部七名侦察员即俘匪四百余名，这说明了我冀察热辽人民解放军的日益强大。陈氏妄想拿出四十九军来作东北蒋匪失败的军心“打气，”然而他的这张所谓“王牌，”一摊出来却是个“憋气”。
    【新华社冀察热辽三日电】迟到消息：热东分区与城、建东（新设县）、凌南等县支队及独立某团配合主力作战，在九月十六日杨仗子歼灭战中完成警戒任务，并俘敌六百名，缴轻重机枪十二挺，步枪一百三十余支，六○炮、迫击炮两门。
