    I. Killed or wounded 934 enemies, captured 101 enemies, arrested 2,503 traitors and local tyrants, totaling 3,538 enemies, stubborn elements, traitors, and local tyrants killed, wounded, or captured.
    II. Confiscated: 7 machine guns, 7 small cannons, 1 submachine gun, 120 rifles, 5 pistols, 3,232 rounds of ammunition, 179 hand grenades, 6 boxes and 60 rounds of cannonballs, 2 binoculars, 8 bayonets, 20 head of livestock, 1 pig, 504 shi of grain, 4 large carts, 948,000 yuan in legal currency, 7 pillboxes burned, and other miscellaneous items not yet calculated.
    Looking at the main achievements of each sub-district, the Fifth Sub-district performed the best: killing, wounding, or capturing 650 enemy puppets, and arresting 1,080 traitors and local tyrants.  Sixty-five rifles were confiscated. The Second Sub-district also performed well: killing, wounding, or capturing a total of 240 enemies, and arresting 1,396 traitors and local tyrants. Five machine guns, 7 small cannons, 50 rifles, and 4 pistols were confiscated. First Sub-district: killed, wounded, or captured 120 enemy stubborn elements, confiscating 1 rifle. Fourth Sub-district: eliminated 51 enemies, confiscating 1 machine gun and 4 rifles.
    The tactical successes in September were: good coordination between the troops and the militia. For example, the Qitai Militia cooperated with the troops to eliminate one enemy battalion; the Tangyin Battalion and Militia cooperated to eliminate 42 enemies; the Taigu Militia, Work Teams, and Armed Turn-Over Teams cooperated with the troops to fight in the Yan control area, which stretched eighty li east to west, captured more than 1,000 traitors and landlords, and distributed more than 1,500 mu of autumn fields. They achieved the great task of closely combining guerrilla warfare with the distribution of the autumn harvest and land, and the cracking down on traitors and local tyrants. On the other hand: they succeeded in severely punishing the grain-grabbing enemies and completed the task of covering the masses' rush harvesting, autumn distribution, and land distribution. For example, the Xiuwu Militia troops covered the Liyuan and Nanzhuang masses in harvesting 400 mu of rice in two days. Jiao Zuo exploded to protect the autumn harvest, killing 18 enemies in three days; Ji Erwa from Taigu killed seven enemies alone, all demonstrating unparalleled heroism in the battle to protect the autumn harvest.

    【本报讯】太行区武委会公布全区民兵九月份单独与配合部队作战战绩如下（据不完全统计）：
    一、毙伤敌人九百三十四名，俘敌人一○一名，捉奸霸二千五百零三人，共毙伤俘敌顽奸霸三千五百三十八人。
    二、缴获：机枪七挺，小炮七门，冲锋枪一枝，步枪一百二十枝，短枪五枝，子弹三千二百三十二发，手榴弹一百七十九颗，炮弹六箱又六十发，望远镜两付，刺刀八把，牲口二十头，猪一口，粮食五百零四石，大车四辆，法币九十四万八千元，烧炮楼七座，其他零星东西尚未计算。
    如以各分区主要战绩来看，五分区最好：毙伤俘敌伪六百五十名，捉奸霸一千零八十名。缴步枪六十五枝。二分区也好：共毙伤俘敌人二百四十名，捉奸霸一千三百九十六名，缴机枪五挺，小炮七门，步枪五十枝，短枪四枝。一分区：毙伤俘敌顽一百二十名，缴步枪一枝。四分区：歼敌五十一名，缴机枪一挺，步枪四枝。
    九月份战术上成功的地方是：部队和民兵配合作战好。如祁太民兵配合部队歼敌一营，汤阴营、民兵配合歼敌四十二名，太谷民兵、武工队、武装翻身队配合部队，打到东西八十余里的阎管区，捉回奸霸地主一千余人，分了秋田一千五百余亩。做到了游击战争与分秋分田、打击奸霸，紧密结合伟大任务。另一方面是：做到了痛歼抢粮敌人，完成了掩护群众抢收、分秋、分田的任务。如修武民兵部队，两天掩护理源、南庄群众收稻四百亩。焦作爆炸保秋，三天毙敌十八名，太谷冀二娃一人杀七敌，都表现了保秋战斗的英勇无比。
