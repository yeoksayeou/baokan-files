Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Moscow dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Marshall on the 9th, requesting the United States to express its attitude towards the Soviet Union's proposal for the simultaneous withdrawal of Soviet and American troops from Korea. The letter pointed out: "The position of the American delegation to the Soviet-American Joint Commission has made it impossible to establish a temporary democratic government in Korea in accordance with the Moscow Agreement. Therefore, the Soviet government has ordered the Soviet delegation to propose the simultaneous withdrawal of Soviet and American troops from Korea, giving the Korean people the opportunity to organize their own government. However, the American delegation has not yet responded to this proposal. This delay is hindering the resolution of the Korean issue."

Note: Soviet Representative to the Korean Soviet-American Joint Commission, General Shtykov, issued a statement on the commission on September 26, proposing that the Soviet Union and the United States simultaneously withdraw their troops from Korea in early 1948, allowing the Korean people to organize their own government. After the statement was issued, it received unanimous support from Korean democratic and progressive人士, causing the American imperialists and Korean traitors to be at a loss. All North Korean newspapers published the full text of the Soviet representative's statement, emphasizing the importance of this proposal. The People's Party, representing the working masses of Korea, issued a statement saying: "The Soviet delegation's proposal is a new and brilliant endeavor. Our party fully supports this proposal and hopes that this issue can be resolved." However, Washington official public opinion exclaimed: "The simultaneous withdrawal of Soviet and American troops from Korea will cause a red coup, making Korea the Bulgaria of Asia," revealing its ambition to refuse to withdraw troops and enslave the Korean people. Korean traitors Syngman Rhee and Kim Koo were extremely worried. They openly admitted that the withdrawal of U.S. troops would undermine the influence of the Korean reactionaries on the people and begged their American masters to "stay in Korea permanently."

　　苏联对朝鲜问题提出新建议
  　主张苏美同时撤兵
    苏外长促美方对此表示态度
    【新华社陕北十六日电】莫斯科讯：苏外长莫洛托夫于九日致函美国务卿马歇尔要求美国对苏关于苏美共同自朝鲜撤兵建议表示态度。该函指出：“苏美联合委员会美代表团的立场，已使遵照莫斯科协议成立朝鲜临时民主政府一事成为不可能。因此苏政府特令苏代表团建议苏美同时自朝鲜撤军，予朝鲜人自行组织其政府之机会。但美代表团对此建议迄未答复，此种拖延，实有碍朝鲜问题之解决。”
    按：朝鲜苏美联合委员会苏代表西地科夫将军，于九月二十六日在该委员会上发表声明，建议苏美两国于一九四八年初同时自朝鲜撤军，听任朝鲜人民自己组织其政府。该声明发表后，获得朝鲜民主进步人士的一致支持，使美帝国主义者及韩奸手足无措。北鲜各报均刊载苏代表的声明全文，并着重指出这一建议的重要性。代表朝鲜劳苦大众的人民党，特发表声明称：“苏联代表团的建议，是一种新的辉煌的工作。本党全力支持这一建议，并希望这一问题得以解决。”但华府官方舆论则惊呼：“苏美同时自朝鲜撤军，将引起红色政变，使朝鲜沦为亚洲的保加利亚，”其拒不撤军及奴役朝鲜人民之野心毕露。韩奸李承晚与金九则极为忧虑，他们公开承认：美军撤退，将破坏朝鲜反动派对人民的影响，并乞求其美国主子“长驻朝鲜。”
