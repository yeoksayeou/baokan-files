　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 3rd: Frontline reporter Zhang Tiefu reports: Liu and Deng's southward counter-offensive army has had a tremendous impact on the internal workings of Chiang's army. More significantly: Firstly, the fighting will of their internal officers and soldiers is even lower, the mood of defeat is generally growing, and desertions are increasing daily; secondly, mass discipline is even more corrupt, and they are hated and opposed by the people everywhere. According to Yuan Fake, a soldier of the 4th company, 1st battalion, 26th regiment, 82nd brigade, 52nd division of Chiang's army who has now come over to the People's Liberation Army: "This unit was forced to go south this time to 'tail' the Liberation Army, and most of the lower-level officers and all the soldiers are extremely panicked, and dare not fight Liu Bocheng's troops again, so they deserted along the way. It is said that the battalion had more than 600 people when it was transferred north from Hankou in March, and now there are less than 300 left. On the evening of August 22nd, near Runan, a company deserted more than 20 people, leaving only 18 people. He escaped at night with three other people from his squad, "Because fighting for Chiang's army means only death; if you don't fight, you will be dragged to death." When they first escaped, they were severely beaten by the squad leader who was chasing them. His foot was injured and his right eye was swollen, but they were not discouraged. They crawled at night and finally found the Liberation Army. Another soldier, Li Tiancai, who was captured in the battle in which we annihilated the 29th regiment of the 58th division of Chiang's bandits in Zhongpu, west of Shangcheng, said: "In Shandong, we heard that the 66th division had been wiped out by the Eighth Route Army, and we were all very scared. This time, the higher-ups told us to go south. At first, we didn't dare to say that we were fighting the Eighth Route Army. Later, when the soldiers found out, they all discussed: the sooner we fight, the sooner we're done; the later we fight, the longer we can live. When our company left Shandong, there were more than 120 people, but only 50 or so were left after deserting all the way. Chen Wu, the company commander of the 7th company of the regiment, said: "Because there were too many deserters, there were only 32 people, including the cooks, after arriving here. The other companies also only had 40 or 50 people left, so they collapsed after one battle." Huang Tianzun, the deputy captain of the Huangchuan County Self-Defense Force who was captured by us, used a fact to expose the corruption of Chiang's army discipline. He said: Chiang's army's 7th division crossed Huangchuan City on August 30th and looted most of the materials and goods from the shops. They grabbed laborers everywhere. After grabbing men, they broke into various households to rape women. The mother, wife, and younger sister of Wang Daorong, the deputy town chief of Chiang's bandit gang, were all raped by Chiang's army. Wang hanged himself out of shame. A merchant in Huangchuan City was shot dead by Chiang's army for refusing to allow Chiang's bandits to rape his family. A thirteen-year-old girl named Chen Silonghujun in the city was raped to death by six soldiers of Chiang's army. Chang Zhengxue, the团 commander of the 29th regiment of the 58th division, also admitted in his order to the battalion commanders on September 15th that his troops were "raping women, turning boxes and cabinets upside down, grabbing chickens and ducks, and stealing vegetables, doing everything."

　　刘邓南征大军震慑敌胆
    蒋匪官兵斗志低落
    【新华社中原前线三日电】前线记者张铁夫报导：刘邓南下反攻大军，对蒋军内部震动极大。较显著者：一为其内部官兵战斗意志更加低落，失败情绪普遍滋长，逃亡日众；二为群众纪律更加败坏，到处遭到人民的仇恨和反对。据目前投奔解放军之蒋军五十二师八十二旅二十六团一营四连战士袁发科称：“该部此次被迫南下“尾追”解放军，多数下级军官及全体士兵均恐慌异常，不敢再与刘伯承部队交手，故沿途纷纷开小差。据称：该营于三月间由汉口北调时共六百余人，现余不到三百。八月二十二日晚在汝南附近，一个连就逃跑了二十余名，只剩下十八个人。他于夜晚会同本班三个人一同逃跑，“因为替蒋军打仗，只有送命，不打仗也要拖死。”他们刚逃出时，曾遭追捕他们的班长的痛击，他的脚被打伤，右眼被打肿，但他们仍不灰心，乃于夜间爬行，终于找到了解放军。另据在商城西中铺我歼灭蒋匪五十八师二十九团战役中所俘士兵李天才称：“在山东我们就听说六十六师被八路军消灭了，都吓的不得了，这回上边叫南下，开头不敢说打八路军，后来当兵的知道了，都纷纷议论说：早打早完蛋，晚打还能活几天。我们一个连从山东出发时一百二十多人，一路逃跑只剩了五十多人。该团七连连长陈武称：“该连因逃亡过众，到此地后连火夫等共三十二人，其他各连，亦只剩下四五十人，故一战即溃。被我俘获之潢川县自卫队分队长黄天樽，用一件事实揭露蒋军军纪之败坏。他说：蒋军第七师于八月三十日越过潢川城，将各商店之物资货品大部抢去。彼等到处抓夫，将男人抓走后，即闯进各住户强奸妇女，蒋匪帮之付镇长王道荣之母亲、老婆及妹子，皆遭蒋军奸淫，王乃羞愧吊死。潢川城某商人不愿蒋匪奸辱其家人，遭蒋军击毙。城四龙虎隽有一十三岁之女孩，遭六名蒋军之轮奸而毙命，五十八师二十九团团长常正学，九月十五日给各营长的命令中，亦招认其部队“强奸妇女、翻箱倒柜、抓鸡打鸭、偷窃小菜，无所不为。”
