　　Eastern Hubei Front Continues to Achieve Major Victory
  　Our Army Annihilates Two and a Half Bandit Brigades
  　The Yangtze River Area is Shaken; Chiang Kai-shek Announces Martial Law
    【Xinhua News Agency, Eyuwan Front, 28th】After the People's Liberation Army occupied Wuxue and controlled more than 300 miles of the Yangtze River coastline, Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Nanjing were greatly shaken. They urgently transferred the entire 40th Division (minus one regiment) and the entire 82nd Brigade of the 52nd Division, totaling one division headquarters, two brigade headquarters, and five regiments, from Huanggang to reinforce Guangji. On the 26th, they were surrounded by a unit of our People's Liberation Army in the narrow area of Jieling and Gaoshanpu, less than ten miles away, northeast of Qichun and west of Guangji. Our army launched a general offensive again at dawn on the 27th. After eight hours of fierce fighting, the battle was resolved at 2 p.m. The entire enemy was annihilated, and the results of the battle are being checked.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th】According to continuous reports from the Associated Press and United Press, after General Liu Bocheng's People's Liberation Army captured the important town of Wuxue on the 22nd, controlling a large section of the Yangtze River coastline, Chiang Kai-shek bandits were extremely panicked. All ports along the Yangtze River from Hankou to Jiujiang have announced martial law. Gui Yongqing, the acting commander-in-chief of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit navy, went to Jiujiang on the 26th to personally direct the "Yangtze River Battle." The Chiang Kai-shek bandit navy's toy fleet was dispatched one after another to escort the armed forces for its civil war between Nanjing and Hankou. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly established a "Special Self-Defense Force" in Sichuan to prevent the People's Liberation Army from attacking. According to the Shanghai English-language North China Daily News on the 26th, people's guerrillas continued to be active in Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha and other areas in the suburbs of Shanghai. A spokesman for the Shanghai Garrison Command lamented the "mopping up" of the above-mentioned areas. The newspaper stated that Shanghai will implement "winter defense" from November 1st. The entire "defense measures" are the responsibility of Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, who may announce a martial law order or a night curfew. Martial law will be implemented simultaneously in Shanghai's urban area and ten suburban districts.
