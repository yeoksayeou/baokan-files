From our newspaper's report from Licheng: Xi Wu Village, learning from last year's autumn experience, where attention to cotton planting techniques was lacking, leading to delayed boll opening and picking, resulting in the failure to prepare the fields for subsequent planting, which in turn affected the spring planting, not achieving a full stand of seedlings. Therefore, they are emphasizing cotton techniques and dealing with delayed boll opening as a key factor in promoting the completion of autumn cultivation. Currently, the entire village has organized 111 women, and 210 mu of cotton fields have been treated to address late boll opening. Due to the rainy and cold weather this autumn, in order to prevent frost and ground freezing from hindering land preparation, the technical committee, led by Han Xingwang, convened a meeting of technicians, mutual aid team leaders, and team captains on the night of October 7th to specifically study autumn cultivation techniques. Political Director Sun Laohu said: The main reason we didn't get a full stand of seedlings in the valley fields this spring was the failure to prepare the cotton fields last autumn. As the ancients said, "Early silkworms straighten wheat, autumn land preparation is key." This autumn, there is a lot of rain, the ground is wet, and frost is expected early, so we must seize the time to prepare the land. Old Hero Zhang Wanghu said: "Autumn plowing breaks the skin, equivalent to three spring plows; failure to plow in autumn leads to great losses!" Technician Liu Shouguo said: "Farming a thousand acres is not as good as a skilled hand on the plow. The quality of plowing makes a big difference. We must select skilled plowmen to specialize in plowing." Based on the characteristics of this autumn, they researched and developed the following autumn cultivation methods: (1) Select skilled plowmen to specialize in plowing. The village has 92 head of livestock and 46 teams. Each team should have a dedicated plowman. A total of 52 people, including Liu Manhe and Zhang Hetang, were selected from the village's 17 teams to specialize in plowing. (2) Plow the south-facing, low-lying, and wet land first, then plow the sunny land. The village has over 210 mu of autumn land that is south-facing, which should be plowed first, followed by the sunny land. (3) Deep plowing with fertilizer, covering the stubble with manure. According to the Technical Committee's research, plowing the autumn stubble once can decompose the crop stalks and leaves, equivalent to applying a season's worth of fertilizer. It was decided to completely plow all 783.4 mu of valley land, 672 mu of corn land, and 477 mu of miscellaneous land, covering the stubble as we go. (4) Do not harrow grassland or land with pests, eliminate pests and weeds. (Fan Renqing)

From our newspaper's report from Changzhi: After the last mobilization for autumn harvesting and cultivation in Su Dian, Second District, there was no action for more than ten days. The reason was that cadres and activists had a sense of complacency and waited, not regarding autumn land preparation as important. For example, Guo Genshun said: "It doesn't matter whether the autumn land is prepared or not. As long as we apply more fertilizer and till it more in the spring, we can catch up." Shen Quangui said: "Su Dian doesn't have time for land preparation. We have to go to the vegetable gardens after harvesting the autumn crops." Upon discovering this idea, the leadership proposed to discuss whether frost was expected after several days of rain and a northwest wind, and whether the ground would freeze early. Wang Tianshui said: "Relying solely on vegetable gardens is not enough. We're about to eat the autumn harvest. It's not okay to eat only vegetables without harvesting the autumn crops. If we don't harvest the autumn crops, what will the army eat? If the army doesn't have enough food, they won't be able to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, and we will suffer too." Huang Quanshui said: "We must harvest the autumn crops and plow the land. The ground is wet and freezing early this year. Plowing this year will give us productive land next year and enable us to get a full stand of seedlings. As the saying goes: Seize autumn, seize summer, snatch food from the tiger's mouth; an eighty-year-old man never forgets autumn land preparation." Everyone's enthusiasm was high, and slogans were proposed: See the crops growing strong; don't consider it grain until it's brought home; an eighty-year-old never forgets autumn land preparation; autumn plowing is better than spring plowing; an autumn kick is better than a spring hoe. Under these slogans, enthusiasm for autumn harvesting and cultivation was even higher. After mass meetings were held in each street at night, the masses' thinking was straightened out, and they took action the next day.

　　雨多天寒地冻早西仵抓紧秋垡地
    【本报黎城讯】西仵村接受去年秋天经验，由于种花没注意技术进行打晚花，结果到立冬还没摘完花，以致全村花地没有垡下茬，影响今春没有捉齐小苗，因此提出抓紧棉花技术，修理打晚花，是推动秋耕完成的一个主要关键。现全村已组织起妇女一百一十一人，已将二百一十亩棉花进行了打晚花。由于今秋雨涝天气冷，为了及早防止风霜地冻垡不下茬，技术委员会韩兴旺等，于十月七号夜召开技术员互助组长队长会议，专门进行了秋耕技术的研究，政治主任孙老虎说：今春谷地没捉齐苗儿，主要是去年秋花地没有垡下，古人说：“早蚕直麦秋垡茬”，今年秋雨多地湿下霜早肯早冻，咱们可得捉紧垡茬才是。老英雄张王虎说：“秋天垡地犁破皮，顶住春天犁三犁，秋天垡不下地吃亏可大哩”！技术员刘守国说：“家种千顷地，不如扶手一张犁，耕地把式好坏耕好耕不好可有很大差别，咱们必须选出犁地把式专门犁地”。根据今秋的特点，并研究出秋耕的办法是：（一）选出犁地把式专门进行犁地，全村九十二头牲口四十六犋，每犋牲口要选一个专人撑犁，全村十七个组共选出刘满河、张河堂等五十二人专门掌犁。（二）先耕南背下湿地，后耕＠道向阳地，全村有二百一十余亩秋地是南背地，要先耕完，然后再耕＠道地。（三）带垧深耕地，垡茬顶上粪，根据技委会的研究，是秋垡茬翻一犁，能将庄稼枝叶腐烂，足顶上一季粪，决定将全村七百八十三亩四分谷地，六百七十二亩玉茭地，和四百七十七亩杂地，完全带垧翻下。（四）草地虫地不耢，消灭害虫除杂草。（范任卿）
    【本报长治讯】二区苏店，上次动员秋收秋耕后，有十几天时间毫无行动，原因是干部积极分子，存在着麻痹等待思想，对秋垡地也不当大事，如郭根顺说：“秋地垡不垡不要紧，只要春天多上粪，多做一遍，就把垡地活赶出来了。”申全贵说：“苏店就没有垡地时间，收着秋就得去园地。”发现这种思想，领导上提出，下了好几天雨，刮一场西北风，是否要有霜，地是否要早冻，大家酝酿讨论，王天水说：“光指园地不算话，秋眼看吃到嘴里了，不收秋光吃蔬菜不行，如果收不上秋，军队吃啥？军队吃不上粮食，打不倒老蒋，咱们也要遭殃。”黄全水说：“收秋还得犁地，今年地根湿冻的早，今年犁下地，明年有垧地，能捉住小苗，古语：抢秋夺夏，虎口夺食，八十老汉不忘秋垡地。”大家情绪高涨，提出口号是：看见庄稼长的强，收不到家里不顶粮，八十老不忘秋垡地，秋天铧皮，胜过春天犁一犁，秋天踢一脚，超过春天掘一镢。在这口号下对秋收秋耕情绪更高。经过各街黑夜召开群众大会，打通了群众思想，第二天便行动起来。
