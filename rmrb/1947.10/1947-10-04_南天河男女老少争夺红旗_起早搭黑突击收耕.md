　　Nantianhe, Men and Women, Old and Young, Compete for Red Flags
  　Starting Early and Working Late to Rush the Harvest
    [This newspaper Changzhi news] After completing the regular wheat harvest, Nantianhe Village in the Second District established a plan for autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and wheat replanting. The valley land must be harvested by the 15th, and the corn stalks must be cleared by the 20th. By the first day of September, all 1,920 mu of crops in the village must be harvested, ensuring that the fields are cleared and the land is plowed. On the night of the 22nd, the village branch held a meeting. Comrade Cao Linshui, the branch secretary, called on Party members to take the lead in this great movement and strive for the entire village to complete the plan on time, ensuring that harvesting, plowing, and planting are not delayed. The slogans were: "Rush the harvest like seizing from the summer, rush the harvest in wind and frost, ten parts of effort for ten parts of harvest," "Cut each yellow patch as it appears, plow and sow each mu as it's cleared." Then, the whole village held a mass mobilization meeting. The village production committee proposed making two model flags, and after the autumn harvest, evaluations and awards would be given to models. This further encouraged everyone's enthusiasm. The fields were divided into dozens of groups, and a challenge competition was launched between groups and teams to strive for early harvest and win the red flag. On the 24th, before dawn, Comrade Cao Linshui and the group leaders of his team ran around in the streets, calling everyone in the village. By the time it was light, men and women, old and young, from the entire village were in the fields. Seven young women in the first team formed a line, rolling their sleeves up to their elbows. They said as they cut: Let's see who cuts faster. Linshui's mother, who was over sixty years old, said: "In the autumn, a working woman who gets out of bed is worth two people. We worked hard all year for the food on our plates, and we can't let the wind and frost ruin it." Wang Nianhao, who was fourteen years old, ran from the east side to the west side after finishing cutting. He was so busy that he didn't even bother to wipe his nose, and he just grabbed and cut at the waist. At breakfast, the work of each group was evaluated at the field, and each male full laborer received four points in the morning, while Wang Nianhao received three points, equivalent to one and a half jin of rice. Wang Meihua, a thirteen-year-old girl, also received two points. The team had ten male full laborers, seven female full laborers, eight boys and girls, one old lady, and one old man, totaling twenty-seven people, who harvested seventeen mu of grain in the morning. In the rush to harvest wheat, Yang Hei＠, from the sixth group, had his family of four, old and young, cut, plow, and plant simultaneously. The livestock was dedicated to plowing. During planting, the strong men pulled the seed drill, the old man shook the seed drill, and the old woman spread the fertilizer. Yang Quangui, who had a disabled leg, was also busy in the field digging at the corners of the field and repairing the borders. In less than a morning, the four of them also replanted two mu of valley land with wheat. Under the leadership of Comrade Cao Linshui and activists such as Wang Qihao, who started early and worked late, the entire village, men and women, old and young, worked together, harvesting 373.5 mu of grain and plowing and replanting 63 mu of land with wheat in one day.

    [This newspaper Changzhi news] Jia Juyou's group in Guxian Village, Second District, resolutely implements the principle of cutting and plowing each yellow patch, and strives to plant more replanted wheat, fully organizing to rush. Forty-one production activists, such as Fan Laibao and Jing Baoliang, emerged on the spot and volunteered to do heavy work. Fan Laibao said: "Grain in the granary, wheat in the vat, remember to seize food from the tiger's mouth." Jing Baoliang said: "Men must not forget autumn plowing, women must not forget night spinning." Everyone agreed that to ensure that the three tasks are not delayed, it is necessary to accurately calculate the labor force and make specific divisions of labor in order to complete the task early and save labor. In short, rewards are given for exceeding standards in work. After detailed calculation and scientific division of labor, everyone began to make plans on the 13th and challenge each other. Jia Juyou, the group leader, proposed: Clean the fields by the 27th, conduct inspections, and prepare twenty towels as awards for production activists.
