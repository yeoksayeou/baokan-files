Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 8th. Two major armies of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, which have penetrated deep into the Kuomintang-controlled areas of Shaanxi, have now victoriously joined forces in the Huanglong Mountain area, liberating vast areas south of Luochuan and Yichuan, and north of Yaoxian and Chaoyi, between the Xianyang-Yulin Highway and the Yellow River, echoing the Chen-Xie army advancing into southern Shaanxi. One unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army that entered east of Luochuan continued to sweep the Huanglong Mountain area, a famous military stronghold in Shaanxi, from the 30th of last month to the 4th of this month, engaging in eight battles. In addition to liberating Jiuxian and Guanfu, as previously reported, they also liberated Shifuzhen (80 li northwest of Taiyang County), the seat of the Huanglong Administrative Bureau, and Luoshengzhen and Huaibaizhen, more than 40 li east of Luochuan, as well as Tujizhen, more than 70 li east of中部 (中部). The defending enemy fled at the sight of our forces. Nearly 300 enemies were captured, and two mortars, five light machine guns, and 224 rifles were seized, along with over 1,000 bags of flour, 700 shi of grain, and some other military supplies. Another unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, which liberated the Baishui area, cooperated in sweeping the southern part of the Huanglong Mountain area, and successively liberated Qinguanzhen, more than 50 li southeast of 中部 (中部), Beiyuanzhen, 90 li east of Yijun, and important strongholds such as Shitouzhen and Huanglong Street, from the 3rd to the 4th. They have now victoriously joined forces with our army moving south. Note: The Huanglong Mountain area faces the natural barrier of the Yellow River's Yumenkou to the east, is separated by the Luo River from the Qiao Mountain range to the west, connects to the northern Shaanxi mountains to the north, and faces the Guanzhong Plain to the south. During the Anti-Japanese War, when the 胡匪 (a derogatory term for Nationalist soldiers) repeatedly attempted to attack the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, they stationed heavy troops here. The local people, unable to bear the oppression of the Chiang-Hu匪 (Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist army) bandit regime, frequently launched armed uprisings. In order to further intensify the exploitation and oppression of the people, the Chiang-Hu匪 (Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist army) regime, in addition to establishing the Huanglong Mountain Garrison Headquarters, also established an "Administrative Bureau" here, located in Shifuzhen, 60 kilometers southeast of Luochuan, under the jurisdiction of nine townships and sixty-four bao (an administrative unit), with a population of more than 35,000. The administrative area of the "Administrative Bureau" was bordered by Hancheng, Luochuan, Chengcheng, and Yichuan counties in the east, west, south, and north, respectively, covering an area of approximately 9,000 square kilometers. The local area produces coal, petroleum, fur, and medicinal materials. The people in the area are jubilant and have held meetings to celebrate the recapture of Shifuzhen and other places by the Northwest People's Liberation Army.

　　咸榆路东广大地区获得解放
  　我会师黄龙山
  　与陕南陈谢大军遥相呼应
    【新华社西北八日电】西北人民解放军深入陕西蒋管区之两部大军，现已胜利会师于黄龙山地区，并解放洛川、宜川以南，耀县、朝邑以北，咸榆公路与黄河间之广大地区，与挺进陕南之陈谢大军遥相呼应。进入洛川以东之西北人民解放军某部，于上月三十日至本月四日继续扫荡陕西著名军事要地黄龙山地区，共作战八次，除解放旧县、关抚已志前报外，又解放黄龙设治局所在地之石辅镇（邰阳县西北八十余里）与洛川东四十余里之洛生镇、槐柏镇，中部东七十余里之土基镇等市镇多处。守敌望风而逃，计俘敌近三百人，缴获迫击炮二门，轻机枪五挺，步枪二百二十四支。面粉千余袋，粮食七百石及其他军用品一部。解放白水地区之另部西北人民解放军，则配合扫荡黄龙山地区南部，于三日至四日相继解放中部东南五十余里之秦关镇、宜君东九十里之北原镇及石头镇、黄龙街等重要据点。现已与南下我军胜利会师。按：黄龙山区东望黄河天险禹门口，西隔洛河与乔山山脉对峙，北连陕北山地，南向关中平原。抗日期间胡匪历次企图进攻陕甘宁边区时，即于此地驻扎重兵。当地人民由于不堪蒋胡匪暴政之压榨，民变武装时起。而蒋胡匪为更强疯狂压榨人民计，除设黄龙山警备司令部外，复设“设治局”于此，地址设于洛川东南六十公里之石辅镇，下辖九乡六十四保，人口三万五千余，“设治局”行政区域东西南北分与韩城、洛川、澄城、宜川各县为界，面积约为九千方公里，当地出产煤炭、石油、皮毛、药材等。此次石辅镇等地被西北人民解放军克复，该区人民欢欣鼓舞，纷纷开会庆祝。
