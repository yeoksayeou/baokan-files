Liberated Peasants in Various Regions
Prioritize Harvesting and Planting for Families of Servicemen

[This Newspaper Combined Dispatches] During the rush to harvest autumn crops and plant wheat, liberated peasants in various regions are prioritizing the care of military families. In Wangbao Village, Second District of Gaoping, 36 disabled veterans from the Rongjiao First Institute harvested 34 mu of autumn crops for military families and conscripted laborers. Even comrades with only one arm volunteered to carry loads, refusing to drink the masses' water or eat their food. After the masses in Shitangou Village finished cutting the rice during a break in the weather, they worried about rain and first carried back the 43 mu of rice belonging to 12 military families and conscripted laborers. The family members of those serving said, "Now we won't be afraid even if we serve for a year, truly not worrying about planting or harvesting!" Under the leadership of village chief Jin Yuzhong, the masses in Miao'ergou harvested 86 mu of autumn crops for military families and conscripted laborers. In Beinao Village, Lingchuan, all six military and conscripted laborer families were liberated masses. With no one at home to harvest, the masses and primary school children cleaned the six households' fields of rice in a single day on the eighth day of the month. In Dianxiyu, Lincheng, under the leadership of farm association chairman Guo Xiangzi and others, they harvested 6.2 mu of rice for military families in one night and also carried 48 loads of manure for one mu of land. The women's clearing teams of Dianshang, Zhaozhuang, and Dianxiyu helped military families cut rice and thresh. The five members of Liu Qiuxiang's group in Dianxiyu cut 130 rice stalks for military families in one day. Bai Ge and Zhao Menglan voluntarily planted 13 mu of wheat for military families. In Shutan, Fourth District of Neiqiu, cadres led three substitute farming teams, cutting over 6,000 jin of artemisia and mixing it with soil to make 120 loads of green manure, which has been distributed to four military families. In Xinzhuang, Cixian, Liu Chunbao's mutual aid team had a militiaman who went to serve, so they first finished planting the wheat for this militiaman's family.

[This Newspaper Jinan 18th Dispatch] Congshanlou, First District of Yuanchao, bid farewell to stretcher-bearers heading south, guaranteeing the military families' wheat would be planted well. Before the stretcher-bearers left, the village's self-defense team assigned specific people based on the amount of land each stretcher-bearer's family owned and selected team leaders. Village cadres checked each household on a regular basis (every five days). Some immediately plowed the land and cut rice. The school and the director of the women's association, in order to take care of those who left in a hurry, fearing they wouldn't have enough clothes, shoes, and socks, mobilized all the women's association members and elder sisters to help make shoes and clothes for each family. The school created teaching materials, calling on all students to be responsible for making fertilizer and doing odd jobs for the families of the stretcher-bearers. When the stretcher-bearers were about to leave, the entire village held a grand farewell meeting, performing Yangko dances, and beating gongs and drums to the village head. Everyone asked them: "You must make contributions on the front lines and strive to be model stretcher-bearers. Ensure that production at home is done well, and please rest assured." Amidst enthusiastic applause and slogans, each stretcher-bearer was extremely excited.

　　各地翻身农民
    先给参战家属收种
    【本报综合讯】在突击秋收种麦中，各地翻身农民首先照顾军属。高平二区王报村荣教第一所卅六位残废军人为军属及参战民夫收秋卅四亩，一条臂膊的同志也自报担运，不喝群众的水、不吃群众的饭。石堂沟村群众趁天晴割完谷子后，看见天阴了怕下雨，首先把十二家军属及参战民夫的四十三亩谷子担回，参战家属们说：“这样就参战一年也不怕，真是种也不愁收也不愁！”庙儿沟群众在村长靳玉忠领导下，为军属及参战民夫秋收八十六亩。陵川北脑村六户军属民夫都是翻身群众。家里无人收秋，初八日群众和小学儿童，一天便把这六户的谷子割净。临城店西峪在农会长郭祥子等领导下，一晚上给军属割谷子六亩二分，还担一亩地的粪四十八担。店上、赵庄、店西峪妇女清场队，帮助军属切谷打场，店西峪刘秋香小组五人一天给军属切谷子一百三十个。白鸽并赵孟兰自动给军属种上麦子十三亩。内邱四区的树滩干部带领了三个代耕组，割蒿六千余斤，掺土沤成绿肥一百二十担，已分给四家军属。磁县辛庄柳春保的互助组，组内有一个民兵去参战，他们就先将这民兵家里的麦子种完。（高平大众报、陵川生产发家报、临城生产小报、内邱大众报、磁县生产通讯报）
    【本报冀南十八日电】元朝一区从善楼欢送南征担架，保证军属麦子种好。在担架未走以前，村的自卫队员即根据担架家中土地多少，具体分人，并选出组长，村干按期（五天一次）分户检查。有的就马上犁地、割谷子。学校与妇会主任为了照顾他们走的仓促，怕没有衣服鞋袜，就动员所有妇会员与大姐妹们到各家帮助做鞋做衣。学校编出教材，号召全体学生负责给担架家属造粪做零活。担架临走时，全村群众开大会欢送，扭秧歌，锣鼓喧天，送至村头，大家要求他们：“要在火线立功，争取模范担架。家中生产，保证做好，请放心吧。”在热烈的掌声和口号下，各担架员情极兴奋。
