　　Our Troops Launch Continuous Attacks on Both Southern and Northern Fronts; Chiang Kai-shek's Troops Lack Manpower and Are in a Frenzy
    From the 24th to the 30th of last month, the People's Liberation Army on all fronts, both inside and outside the Great Wall, and both north and south of the Yellow River, launched continuous attacks on Chiang Kai-shek's troops.

    On the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia battlefield, after Chiang Kai-shek's troops were defeated by our Northwest People's Liberation Army in the Chakou battle, with four brigades routed, the remnants fled south from Yan'an. Our Liberation Army pursued them, and one unit captured major military locations such as the Big and Small Laushan and Sujiahe on the Xian-Yan'an highway, 30 kilometers south of Yan'an, on the 22nd, seriously threatening Yan'an's flank and cutting off Hu Zongnan's retreat route. On the 25th, another unit of the Liberation Army suddenly appeared behind Chiang's forces in Guanzhong, briefly liberating Baishui County, 100 kilometers northeast of Xi'an. On the same day, they also blew up the large stone bridge at Jin Suoguan northwest of Yanguan County, cutting off the important supply line Xian-Yulin highway for Hu Zongnan's troops in northern Shaanxi. Hu Zongnan's troops, huddled in Yan'an and northern Shaanxi, are increasingly trapped in a desperate situation with no way to advance or retreat, suffering from hunger and fatigue, and desertions are increasing daily. The offensive in Guanzhong is a powerful coordinated move, coinciding with the advance west along the Longhai Railway by our Chen-Xie army, which is shaking the Hukou Pass. After these continuous attacks, Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's troops are in a frenzy, transferring troops and generals, but they can only attend to one thing at the expense of another. The result is only robbing Peter to pay Paul, and the more they try to fix it, the worse it gets.

    After occupying ten cities and annihilating 25,000 enemy troops, the Chen-Xie army, on the one hand, took advantage of the victory to wave its spears westward, chasing directly to Tongguan; on the other hand, it consolidated its forward positions and established twelve democratic county governments, including Xin'an, Mianchi, Shaanxian, and Guobin, in the newly liberated areas, implementing various democratic measures. The people of western Henan, who have suffered from the four calamities of water, drought, the Yellow River, and Tang Enbo, have risen up to settle accounts with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and completely destroy the roots of feudal rule.

    After our Liu-Deng army in the Central Plains victoriously entered the Dabie Mountains, the current situation is, as commented by our correspondent, that "we can cross the Pinghan Railway westward into the Tongbai Mountains at any time, or cross the Yangtze River southward to gain a foothold in Hunan and Jiangxi, or move eastward into central Anhui to knock on the door of Nanjing, or return north to cross the Yellow River again." We are in such a key position, while Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops are passively beaten everywhere, unable to advance or retreat, and unable to hold their ground. On September 19, we annihilated the 29th Regiment of the 58th Division near Shangcheng, and on the 26th, we routed two brigades of the 85th Division, led by Wu Shaozhou, coming to reinforce, southeast of Huangchuan. On the 22nd, we captured Gushi again. On the 24th, we captured Sanhejian, a key point on the supply line from Bengbu to Shangcheng for Chiang Kai-shek's troops, seizing large amounts of ammunition and military supplies.

    The Chen-Su army in southwestern Shandong moved freely. After completely annihilating the 57th Division at Shatukou, the enemy's two main forces, namely the 5th Division and the 11th Regiment, hurriedly came to reinforce, but were heavily surrounded by our army in the Cao County, Juye, and Chengwu areas. From September 20th to 25th, we killed and wounded a total of more than 7,000 men from the 5th Division and the 11th Division. As a certain military observer said, the great significance of this is to annihilate the main elite forces of Chiang Kai-shek's army and create a favorable foundation for completely annihilating Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops.

    In East China, just as Chiang Kai-shek's troops were making great fanfare, they were constantly subjected to our powerful blows, with about 7,700 men being annihilated. Since August 30, the enemy has invaded with 40 divisions of troops in three routes. On September 18, they were effectively blocked by a unit of our army at Daotou, creating a major victory in the Jiaodong blocking operation. Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Jiaodong will face increasingly difficult circumstances. Even though they can currently invade several empty cities that our army has withdrawn from, they will eventually disperse their forces and lose sight of the other, creating favorable conditions for us to annihilate them in large numbers. The victory of the Daotou blocking operation has proven that the Jiaodong Liberation Army can block strong enemies at any time and achieve victory.

    The Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 700 Chiang Kai-shek troops in Ziya Town on September 24. On the same day, the defending enemy fled upon hearing the news, and we recovered Qing County, threatening Jinghai. The enemy on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway was already panic-stricken. In the past month, the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army has annihilated parts of the 16th Army, the 94th Army, and the 62nd Army, totaling more than 5,000 men, in various battles north of the Daqing River and on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. By September 20, Luan County, southeast of Shijiazhuang, which had been captured by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, was recaptured on the 24th. The enemy and puppet troops who set out from north of Baoding to seize grain were also heavily damaged by us, with more than 1,500 men below the rank of deputy regiment commander being annihilated. Another unit of our army took the initiative to attack the areas around Xinxian and Dingxiang in the northern section of the Pu Railway from September 16 to 18, recovering dozens of villages and towns and annihilating more than 1,500 Yan Xishan troops.

    On the Northeast battlefield, after our Ji-Cha-Re-Liao Liberation Army annihilated the Provisional 22nd Division and the Provisional 50th Division of the 93rd Army in Jinxi, the 79th Division and the 105th Division of the enemy's 49th Army came to reinforce from Jinzhou, but the entire army was wiped out in the same area, and another 12,000 were annihilated and captured by us. After being heavily attacked by the Democratic Allied Army and seasonally, Chiang Kai-shek's troops dug up the 93rd Army from northern Jiangsu in late August to aid the Northeast battlefield, but just one month later, they followed in the footsteps of the 93rd Army. If annihilating the 93rd Army was like kicking the enemy in the butt, then this time it was an even more vicious and heavier kick. This great victory shocked Chiang Kai-shek and the United States. The Northeast is now full of panic, with the "sixth attack of the Manchurian Communist Army seemingly begun" (excerpt from the United Press dispatch from Peiping on the 25th, quoted from the Peiping Xinmin Daily) wailing, and also exclaiming that "the current war seems to have the potential for a general offensive" (same day's dispatch). After this battle, the land supply route, the Beining Railway, of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the Northeast has been severely damaged, and the Huludao unloading point, which was immediately supplemented by Chiang Kai-shek and the United States, is also under the direct threat of our army.

### 南线北线我军连续出击蒋匪兵力不足手忙脚乱

专栏：一周综合战报

　　南线北线我军连续出击蒋匪兵力不足手忙脚乱
    自上月二十四日至三十日一周间，长城内外，黄河南北，各线人民解放军给予蒋匪军以连续打击。
    陕北战场上蒋匪自岔口战斗被我西北人民解放军击溃四个旅之后，残部由延安向南溃逃，我解放军跟踪追击，一部于二十二日攻克延安正南三十公里咸（阳）延（安）公路上之大小劳山及苏家河等军事要地，严重地威胁着延安侧背，斩断了胡匪退路。二十五日另部解放军又突然出现于关中蒋后，一度解放了西安东北一百公里的白水县城，同日又炸毁了阎官县西北金锁关的大石桥，切断了陕北胡匪的重要补给线咸（阳）榆（林）公路。蜷缩在延安及陕北的胡军愈益陷于进退维谷之绝境，饥饿困顿，逃亡日众。而当我陈谢大军沿陇海西进、威震沪关之际，关中的出击更是一个有力的配合。蒋胡匪经此连续打击后，手忙脚乱，调兵遣将，但是顾得了东却顾不了西，其结果只是剜内补疮，越补越烂。
    陈谢大军于占领十城、歼敌二万五千之后，一面乘胜挥戈西指，直追至薄；一面巩固了前进阵地，在新解放的区域建立新安、渑池、陕县、果宾等十二个民主县政府，实行了各项民主措施。饱经水、旱、黄、汤（恩伯）四灾的豫西人民已经纷纷起来清算蒋家匪帮的罪恶，彻底摧毁封建统治的根子。
    中原我刘邓大军胜利进入大别山区后，目前的局势正如本服记者所评述的，“随时可以西越平汉进入桐柏山区，或南渡大江插足湘赣，或东出皖中，而叩京都之门，或回师北上，再渡黄河。”我处于如此机要之地位，蒋伪匪们则处处被动挨打，进退不得，驻守又不得。九月十九日，我在商城附近歼灭五十八师第二十九团，二十六日又在潢川东南击溃由吴绍周率领来援的八十五师两个旅，二十二日再克固始。廿四日攻克蒋匪军由蚌埠至商城的补给线要点三河尖，缴获了大量弹药和军用品。
    陈粟大军在鲁西南地区纵横自如，沙土口全歼五十七师之后，敌五大主力之二即第五师及十一团恐忙来援，被我大军于曹县、巨野、城武地区重重包围，自九月二十日至二十五日内，杀伤第五师及十一师等总共七千余人。其大义正如某军事观察家所说的，是在歼灭蒋军主力精锐，造成完全歼灭蒋匪军的有利基础。
    在华东方面，正当蒋匪大吹大擂的时候，不断遭到了我有力的打击，先后被歼约达七千七百名。自八月三十日起，敌以四十师兵力分三路进犯，于九月十八日遭我军一部于道头有力阻击，造成了胶东阻击战的一大胜利。蒋匪在胶东的处境将日益困难，即如目前虽能侵入我军撤离的几座空城，但终将分散兵力，顾此失彼，为我造成大量歼灭的有利条件。遒头阻击战的胜利，即已证明胶东解放军随时可以阻击强敌，并取得胜利。
    晋察冀人民解放军于九月二十四日歼灭蒋匪军七百余于子牙镇，当日守敌闻风逃窜，我收复青县，威胁静海，津浦北段之敌已经惊惶失措。月来，晋察冀解放军在大清河北及津浦北段各战役中，已歼敌十六军、九十四军及六十二军各一部共五千余名。至九月二十日，被蒋军攻陷之石家庄东南之栾县城又于二十四日再度收复，由保定北出发抢粮之敌及伪匪，也遭我重大杀伤，被歼副团长以下一千五百多人。我军另部于九月十六日至十八日主动出击向蒲北段忻县、定襄周围，克复村镇数十，歼阎匪一千五百余名。
    在东北战场，我冀察热辽解放军于锦西歼灭九十三军暂二十二师及暂五○师后，敌四十九军七十九师及一○五师由锦州来援，就在同一地区全军覆没，又被我歼俘一万二千之众。经民主联军及季节性的沉重打击之后，八月下旬蒋匪自苏北将九十三军挖去援东北的战场，然而刚到一月，就蹈了九十三军的覆辙。如果说歼灭九十三军的意义，就等于在敌人屁股上踢了一脚，则这一次又毒更狠更重的一脚。这一伟大的胜利震惊了蒋美，东北现已草木皆兵地出“满洲共军第六次攻击似已开始”（美联驻北平二十五日电摘北平新民报语）的悲鸣，而且惊呼“目前的战事似将有总攻势之妙”（即日电）。这战役后，东北蒋匪的陆上补路线北宁路已经破碎不堪，而蒋美马上补上的卸地葫芦岛也在我军的直接威胁下。
