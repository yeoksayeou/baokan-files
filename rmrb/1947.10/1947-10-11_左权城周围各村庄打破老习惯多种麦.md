　　Villages Around Zuoquan City Break Old Habits and Plant More Wheat
　　[This dispatch from Zuoquan] The Taihang Second Special District Agricultural and Forestry Bureau and the Zuoquan County Government specially convened a meeting of production cadres from ten villages around the city, including Hama Tan and Henan, on the 24th to inspect wheat planting. According to statistics, these ten villages have already sown 815 mu of wheat fields. Last year, these ten villages only planted 453 mu of wheat. This year, they plan to plant 960 mu, more than double last year's amount. The three villages of Chengguan, Hama Tan, and others have never planted wheat since ancient times. This year, the masses broke old habits and planted 140 mu of wheat. Cao Jianglin from Henan Village planted one sheng and six jiu of wheat last year on four fen of land and harvested five dou this year. The old folks happily said, "I've never seen such good wheat. This year, we'll save good seeds and plant more next year." After finishing planting the main crop of wheat, Wuli Hou is now "digging beans and hoeing yams, rushing to plant the second crop of wheat." Qili River is almost finished planting wheat, and the masses are sharpening sickles and threshing to seize the autumn harvest. Chengguan hasn't started planting wheat yet and has only started preparing wheat seeds. After the leadership discovered the problem, they immediately proposed, "Each village should inspect wheat planting and launch a concentrated effort to plant wheat." Chengguan panicked. Everyone discussed and quickly finished the "second crop of wheat" in a concentrated effort. Some said, "Plow deep, apply enough fertilizer, and the seeds must be good." They also proposed various field management plans. (Li Qing)
　　[Another Dispatch] The Third District convened a meeting of key cadres from twenty-seven villages to study the autumn harvest and autumn planting. Everyone discovered several confused ideas: First, people think that since the Cold Dew and Frost's Descent solar terms are approaching, the autumn harvest is still early. Second, it’s believed that plowing the plains is better than plowing the ridges, and plowing the ridges isn’t worth the effort. It is assumed that three plows, six harrows, and nine hoes are not as good as one plow for seedling growth. Third, it's thought that the masses aren't used to doing the harvest and planting at the same time. District Secretary Zhang Wenyu pointed out that the overall goal of this year's autumn harvest is to harvest quickly, cut quickly, and plow quickly. We must act first to prevent wind and frost. Men and women should work together, and everyone should be involved. We must not lose the grain at our doorstep. This clarified the minds of the village cadres. After returning to their villages, the cadres first worked to dispel the masses' old conservative ideas. This year, we will implement large-scale mutual aid for grain harvesting.

　　左权城周围各村庄打破老习惯多种麦
    【本报左权讯】太行二专农林局，左权县政府于二十四日特召开城周蛤蟆滩河南等十村生产干部会检查种麦。据统计十村已下种麦田八一五亩，该十村去年种麦仅四五三亩，今年要种九六○亩，超过去年一倍。城关蛤蟆滩等三村，自古至今未种小麦，今年群众打破老习惯，种麦一四○亩。河南村曹江林去年种升半一六九，四分地今年打了五斗，老汉们高兴的说：“没见过这样好麦，今年少也留好籽，明年得多种些。”五里候种完正茬麦，正“挖豆刨山药，赶种回茬麦”。七里河种麦快完啦，群众正磨镰碾场下手抢秋。城关种麦还没动手，才开始搞麦籽。领导上发现问题之后，即提出：“各村都检查种麦，突击种麦”，城关着了慌。大家讨论迅速突击完“回茬麦”。有的说：“犁深粪饱，还要籽好”，又提出田间各种等计划。（李青）
    【又讯】三区召开了二十七个个村主要干部会议，研究秋收秋耕，大家发现几种糊涂思想：一、割寒露打霜降以为秋收还早哩。二、耕平不耕岭耕岭不够本，三犁六耙九锄，不如一犁好捉苗。三、收耕一齐干群众没习惯等思想，区书张文毓指出今年秋收总目的是收快割快耕快，要先下手为强，防止风霜，男女齐动手，大小没闲人，不要去掉嘴边粮。清醒了村干部头脑，各村干部回村后，先打通群众守旧老规矩思想，今年打谷实行大变工。
