　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 13th: The Liu-Deng Army annihilated the entire 62nd Brigade of the KMT bandit 88th Division in the Huoshan area of western Anhui on the 8th. The Liu-Deng Headquarters recently issued the sixth communique since the counter-offensive, stating: Just as a part of our army annihilated a regiment and a battalion of the KMT army west of Huangpi, a certain unit of our army on the eastern front, on the 8th of this month near Zhangjiadian, 60 li northeast of Huoshan County, annihilated a part of the 88th Division's directly subordinate units and its entire 62nd Brigade in a few hours of fierce fighting. Preliminary statistics from this battle show that more than 600 enemies were killed below the rank of deputy regimental commander and artillery battalion commander, and more than 4,700 officers and soldiers below the deputy brigade commander of the 62nd Brigade, Tang Jiazhen, were captured. The captured materials included one mountain gun (the enemy only carried one mountain gun due to light equipment), 45 mortars and 60mm small cannons, 30 grenade launchers, more than 120 light and heavy machine guns, more than 1,500 rifles, thousands of large and small shells, more than 100,000 rounds of ammunition, 7 radio stations, and many other spoils of war. (Editor's note: The 88th Division was originally a Sichuan army unit, later annexed and reorganized by the Chiang bandit, with the infamous surrenderer Fang Xianjue as its commander. In the Jinxiang-Yutai battle in January of this year, the entire 186th Regiment of its 62nd Brigade and most of the 184th Regiment were annihilated by us.)
