　　I Met Comrade Dimitrov
　　Liu Ningyi
　　The name Comrade Dimitrov made a very deep impression on me. That was ten years ago, when I had just walked out of Chiang Kai-shek’s prison in rags. A female comrade from the Eighth Route Army office settled me in Xiliu County, Nanjing, and gave me Dimitrov’s report at the Seventh Congress of the Communist International as the first book to read. That book was called “The Anti-Fascist United Front,” which clearly pointed out that “Fascism is war,” and called on the people of the world to unite against it. It has been ten years. I have read this book three or four times, and I can almost recite some parts of it. His words were very accurate. Because the Socialist Party of France and the like of Chiang Kai-shek in China insisted on destroying unity, being anti-people, and pro-fascist, they shot themselves in the foot, and war finally became inevitable. The people defeated the German, Italian, and Japanese fascist bandits with the power of unity, but 70 to 80 million lives and countless assets were sacrificed. How tragic! If Dimitrov’s proposal had been adopted to prevent it in advance with the power of the people’s united front, the scourge of Hitler and other demons would not have been unavoidable. The lesson is too profound!
　　I have always thought this way. Dimitrov is truly a genius, a pragmatic revolutionary. Later, I learned that he had been in prison and had been tested by criminal law. This is how he was trained. Time flies so fast! In a blink of an eye, ten years have passed, and the world has changed.
　　One morning, in the South Slav Federation of Trade Unions in Belgrade (the capital of Yugoslavia), the white-haired old chairman held a telegram and said kindly: “A telegram came from Sofia (the capital of Bulgaria). The Federation of Trade Unions—you know the honorary chairman Dimitrov—invites you to go there. A grand mass meeting has been prepared to welcome you. If the comrades agree, I will reply to the telegram immediately.”
　　The memories of the past ten years flooded into my mind. Although I still had many things to do and needed to return to Paris immediately, I finally couldn't help but accept this invitation.
　　“Okay, we are willing to go to Bulgaria to see Dimitrov and his workers. Let’s leave on July 11th!”
　　Bulgaria is east of Yugoslavia, with a population of more than six million. The Balkan Mountains run through the center. The land is not very fertile. The ancient Roman Empire and Turkey occupied this country for a long time, and Nazi Germany ravaged it. For many years, plagued by floods, droughts, and terrifying tyranny, the Bulgarian people were left with only poverty and famine. This time, the Allied forces of Britain and the United States sent troops to fight Germany in the so-called second battlefield, but the army was slow to advance, and swarms of aircraft randomly dropped bombs in Bulgarian territory, killing not fascists but kind people who opposed Germany; destroying not fascist fortifications but workers’ residences. A look at Sofia reveals a scene of ruins and rubble, and one can imagine the fierce burning and terrifying scenes at the time. In addition, the German army carried out destruction when they retreated. Thus, this great war left Bulgaria with scars all over its body.
　　The population of Bulgaria decreased from seven million to six million, and poverty was compounded by destruction. A clever, passionate, and lovely nation unfortunately went through so many disasters, but finally stood up, standing up under the leadership of this giant.
　　Dimitrov formulated a two-year plan to develop industry and agriculture simultaneously. The first priority was to ensure that everyone had food and clothing. On the evening of July 16th, we arrived at a forest in the western suburbs of Sofia, where the home of this sixty-year-old man was located. Upon entering, we met his wife, who was very stout and truly a kind mother. She was so affectionate when she saw me. She asked, “Are Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in good health?” “Where is Kang Sheng?” “Where is Comrade Zhou Enlai?” “Are your wife and children safe?” Then she called out a Chinese child, the daughter of a comrade, who was unattended and raised by her side. At this moment, Comrade Dimitrov came out, shook hands with us warmly, and led us into their house. He was very tall and thin, but his complexion was ruddy and his spirit was full. We started talking. He is a great theorist, the first prime minister of the cabinet, and an intimate friend. We talked about Bulgaria, our country, and China.
　　“Although our country is small and our experience is limited, our two-year plan is to build our own country with the power of the Bulgarian people themselves. The United States wants to use its dollars to control the world and turn the world into its colony. This is the so-called Marshall Plan for European aid. We don’t need its assistance.”
　　Indeed, the Bulgarian people are capable of self-reliance. The land of the Bulgarian traitors has been distributed to the farmers. Middle peasants, poor peasants, rich peasants, and small landlords have united to form agricultural cooperatives, and cattle, furniture, manpower, and land have been put into shares. Not only are vast farms connected into one piece, but there are also factories for manufacturing tools, canals have been dug, wells have been drilled, and groups of men and women are harvesting wheat in the fields. The peppers and watermelons in the vegetable gardens have also ripened. Young girls are picking fruits and singing mountain songs, children are herding cattle and sheep while holding books, and little babies are lying in rows of small beds in newly built houses, sleeping soundly during their afternoon nap. They don’t need a single dollar to help.
　　The youth of Bulgaria have organized themselves. Teachers, students, workers, and farmers, men and women, have formed railway teams, set up tents in the mountains and forests, rolled up their sleeves, walked barefoot, pushed carts, and sweated while building railways. A large river in the north, the Poliferna, has been flooded for years. Four thousand Bulgarian youths have made up their minds to conquer it and plan to build a large dam within five years, called the Dimitrov Dam, which will generate 50,000 kilowatts of electricity and irrigate thousands of acres of farmland. They also don’t need a single dollar to help.
　　Bulgarian workers can repair and manufacture locomotives themselves, they can mine coal and make steel themselves, they can spin their own country's cotton and wool into yarn and weave it into cloth, and they can produce a lot of cigarettes and rose perfume for sale to foreign countries. They don't need a single dollar to help.
　　"American imperialists are covering up fascism with new names. 'Fascism is war.' They still want to create a third world war. Is it possible? This only shows their panic and fragility, and it is actually impossible!"
　　On the eve of World War II, the communist parties of various countries pointed out that as long as the people could unite well and unanimously oppose fascism, war could be avoided. It is a pity that some people did not do this. The current situation is different.
　　“After World War II, the people of all countries have made progress, and socialist countries and new democratic countries have become more powerful. The people of all countries have good unified organizations, but there are many contradictions within the reactionary forces. We, the people of all countries, must step up the completion of the work that was not completed last time. Expose the conspiracies of American imperialism everywhere and form a worldwide united front for peace. These conditions are fully available, and we are fully capable of preventing a third world war and ensuring world peace.”
　　He stated this issue in a firm tone. After we had tea and snacks, he happily asked about the situation in China. I talked about the Chiang government’s betrayal of the country, dictatorship, and civil war, and the patriotic great alliance of the Chinese people. We will surely defeat the reactionary demon, the four big families. Dimitrov expressed his deep admiration and said: “Comrade Mao Zedong’s proposal is very correct. The people of all countries must learn from them! Unite all the power of the people to oppose the minority of reactionaries. This method is very correct!”
　　“We know that the Chinese Communist Party has many well-trained and knowledgeable comrades—Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai... They understand the demands of the Chinese people and are so closely connected with the people. This is an invincible force!” “China’s task is very important!”
　　We also talked about learning and rectification. He looked around and said: “Although the revolution in our country has come to an end, we must intensify our studies! Study!”
　　He also asked about the Chinese workers’ movement. I talked about the free and happy life of the workers in the liberated areas, the war of self-defense, and the anti-hunger and anti-civil war movement in the Kuomintang areas. The two are unified wars. He said happily: “Very good, very good!” “The workers of the world must also unite regardless of nationality or belief. In order to ensure the peace of mankind, we must have more exchanges and exchange more experiences and lessons, so that everyone’s feelings and thoughts become more intimate and consistent!”
　　When he heard that we were about to leave Bulgaria, he said with regret: “You are leaving after only a few days. You could stay a few more days, right?” This made me deeply feel that the workers of the world are truly like brothers, sisters, family members, fathers, and sons.
　　Before parting, he said: “Greetings to the Chinese workers! I wish Chairman Mao good health! Our Bulgarian people pay tribute to the people who are fighting for independence, democracy, and peace!” August 14th, in Paris

　　我会见了季米特洛夫同志
    刘宁一
    季米特洛夫同志，这个名字对于我，印象是非常深的。那是十年前的时候，我刚刚从蒋介石监狱里穿着一件破衣走出来，八路军办事处的一位女同志，把我安顿在南京的西流县，第一本书就给我共产党国际第七次大会上季米特洛夫的报告，那书名叫“反法西斯统一战线”，明确的指出：“法西斯就是战争”，号召全世界的人们团结起来反对它。已经十年了，这本书我曾读了三四次，有些地方简直背也背得出。他的话很应验，由于法国的社会党、中国的蒋介石之流偏偏破坏团结，反人民，亲法西斯，搬起石头打自己的脚，战争终于不可避免的到来。人民以团结的力量，打败了德意日法西斯匪徒，但是已经牺牲七八千万人的生命，无数的资产，这是多么惨痛！若是采纳了季米特洛夫的主张，以人民统一战线的力量预为防止，希特勒等恶魔之为祸，并非不可避免的。这教训是太深了！
    我一直这样想着。季米特洛夫，真是一位天才，是实事求是的革命家，后来我又知道他坐过监狱，受过刑法的考验，是这样锻炼出来的。光阴过得好快呀！转瞬十年了，世界都变了。
    一天早上，在贝尔格莱德（南斯拉夫首都）南国总工会里，白发苍苍的老主席拿着一张电报和蔼地说道：“索菲亚（保加利亚首都）来了一个电报，总工会——你们知道的名誉主席季米特洛夫——请你们去一趟，那里已经准备开一个盛大的群众大会，欢迎你们，如果同志们同意的话，我立刻回一个电报。”
    这十年来的记忆，又涌现到我的脑海里，虽然我还有很多事情，需要马上回巴黎，终于使我不能自己的答应了这一邀请。
    “好，我们愿到保加利亚，看看季米特洛夫和他的工人们，就在七月十一日出发吧！”
    保加利亚是在南斯拉夫的东方，人口有六百多万、巴尔干山横贯中央，土地并不很肥美，古罗马帝国和土耳其，很长的时间侵占了这一国家，德国纳粹又蹂躏她，多少年来，闹着水旱天灾和恐怖的虐政，给保加利亚人留下来的只有贫困、饥荒。这次盟国英美出兵打德国的所谓第二战场，陆军迟迟不进，成群的飞机却在保国境内乱丢炸弹，炸死的不是法西斯，而是善良的反德的人民；破坏的不是法西斯的工事，而是工人的住宅。到索菲亚一看，一片残垣断壁，可以想象到当时猛烈燃烧恐怖的情景，再加上德军败走时的破坏，于是这次大战又给保国遗下了遍体伤痕。
    保国的人民，从七百万减到六百万，从贫困再加上了破坏。有一个聪明的、热情的、可爱的民族，不幸经过了这许多灾难，却终于站立了起来，在这一位巨人领导下站立起来了。
    季米特洛夫拟定了一个两年计划，工业与农业同时发展，首先是要大家有吃有穿。七月十六日晚上，我们到了索菲亚西郊一个树林里，这里是这位六旬老人的家，一进门见到了他的太太，身体很胖，真是一位慈祥的母亲。她见了我，是那样的亲热。她问过“毛主席、朱总司令的身体好吧？”“康生在那儿？”“周恩来同志在那儿？”“你们太太和孩子平安吗？”之后，她喊出了一位中国的小朋友，这是一位同志的女儿，无人照管，养在她的身旁。正在这时候，季米特洛夫同志出来了，和我们热烈的握过手，引到他们房子里去。他的身体很高很瘦，但是面色却很红润，精神充沛。我们开始了谈话，他是一位伟大的理论家，是一位第一任的内阁总理，更是一位知己的朋友，我们谈到了保国、安国和中国。
    “虽然我们的国家很小，经验也不多，我们的两年计划，是以保国人民自己的力量，建设自己的国家。美国想以他们的金元，控制世界，把世界变为他们的殖民地，这就有所谓马歇尔援欧计划，我们用不到他的援助。”
    的确，保国的人民是能够自力更生的，保奸的土地分配给农民了，中农、贫农、富农和小地主都联合起来，组织了农业合作社，耕牛、家具、人力、土地都入了股。不但有广大的农庄联成一片，而且有制造工具的工厂，挖了运河，凿了水井，成群结队的男男女女，在田野间收割着麦子，菜园里的辣椒、西瓜，也长熟了，青年的姑娘们，采着果子唱着山歌，儿童们赶着牛羊，拿着书本，小娃娃们在新造的房子里，躺在一排排的小床上，甜蜜的睡着午觉。他们用不到一个金元来帮助。
    保国的青年们，组织起来了，教员、学生、工人、农民，男男女女编成了铁道队，在山林里搭起了帐蓬，挽着袖子赤着脚，推着车子流着汗，在修造铁路。北方的一条大河，横在波利弗那，连年闹大水，保国四千青年已经下了决心，开始征服它，计划五年之内造一个大水闸，名叫季米特洛夫大水闸，使这河发出五万千瓦的电力，灌溉千百亩的田园。他们也用不到一个金元来帮助。
    保国的工人们，能自己修理和制造火车头，能自己挖煤炼钢，能自己把本国的棉花、羊毛，纺成线，织成布，能生产很多的香烟和玫瑰花的香水，销到外国，他们用不到一个金元帮忙。
    “美国帝国主义者，用新的名目掩盖法西斯主义，‘法西斯就是战争’，他们还想制造第三次世界大战，可能吗？这只是说明他们的恐慌、脆弱，实际上不可能的！”
    当第二次世界大战的前夜，各国的共产党已经指出，只要是人民能很好的团结起来，一致反对法西斯主义，战争是可以避免的，可惜的很，有些人是没有这样作。现在的局面不同了。
    “第二次世界大战以后，各国人民进步了，社会主义的国家，新民主主义的国家，有了更强大的力量。各国人民，有了很好的统一组织，反动势力的内部却是矛盾很多。我们各国人民，加紧完成上一次所未完成的工作。到处揭穿美帝国主义的阴谋，形成全世界的和平统一战线，这些条件完全具备了，我们完全有可能阻止第三次世界大战，确保世界的和平。”
    他是以坚强的语调，说明了这一问题。待我们吃过茶点，他又很高兴的问到了中国的情况。我谈起了蒋政府的卖国独裁和内战，中国人民的爱国大联合，我们一定能击溃了反动的魔王四大家族的。季米特洛夫深表赞扬的说：“毛泽东同志的主张，是十分对的，各国人民，要向他们学习！团结一切人民的力量，反对少数反动派，这个办法是非常正确的！”
    “我们知道中国共产党，很多久经锻炼的有学问的同志——毛泽东、朱德、周恩来……。他们懂得中国人民的要求，是那样的和人民结合着，这是一个不可战胜的力量！”“中国的任务，是十分重大的！”
    我们又谈到了学习，谈到了整风，他左右看了一下又说：“我们的国家，虽然是革命告一段落，我们还要加紧学习！学习！”
    他又问起中国的工人运动，我讲解放区工人的自由幸福的生活，自卫战争以及国民党区反饥饿反内战的运动，二者是统一的战争。他高兴的说：“很好，很好！”“世界的工人们，也要不分国籍，不分信仰，一致团结，为了确保人类的和平，我们要多多来往，多多交换经验教训，使大家的感情思想更加亲密和一致！”
    他听见我们就要离开保国了，他惋惜的说：“来了几天就要走了，多留几天也来得及吧？”使我深深感觉到，世界的工人，真有如兄弟姐妹家人父子一般。
    临别他说：“问候中国的工人！祝毛主席的健康！我们保国的人民，向你们为独立民主和平斗争的人民致敬！”八月十四日于巴黎
