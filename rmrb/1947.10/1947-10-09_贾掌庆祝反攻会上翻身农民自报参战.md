Jiazhang Celebrates Counter-Offensive with Liberated Peasants Voluntarily Enlisting
[This Dispatch from Changzhi] On the 28th, Jiazhang Village in the Second District held a meeting of over a thousand villagers. First, they reported the victorious news of the overall counter-offensive to everyone, and then reported the three reasons for Chiang Kai-shek's inevitable defeat. In this upsurge, they put forward the slogan "Fully launch the great counter-offensive, voluntarily enlist to dig up the old roots!" Wang Hushan was the first to speak: "I am twenty-four years old this year, right in my prime. My family has been liberated, and the village has overturned the small stone slab. I think we must continue to overturn the big stone slab and help the peasants in the Chiang-controlled areas to be liberated and wipe out Chiang Kai-shek's lair!" Meng Shuangquan said: "There are three brothers in my family. My eldest brother and my third brother have already joined the Eighth Route Army for seven or eight years. They have already made meritorious contributions. Today, I voluntarily sign up to join the army to dig up the old roots and strive to make meritorious contributions." Wang Baozhi said: "My family used to be very poor, and no one looked up to us. Now that we have been liberated, we have food and clothing. We must continue to fight Old Chiang to protect our rice bowls." His brother, Baocai, said: "You are voluntarily enlisting today to protect our own rice bowls. I hope you return with meritorious service; then we will be happy!" At present, eighteen people have voluntarily signed up. Hao Jihai said: "Enlisting in the army is to dig up the old roots. This time, you go ahead, and next time, we will follow." Many women also competed to say they would help solve the daily difficulties at home, saying that the front and rear should have great work exchanges, and prioritize harvesting and cultivating the land of those who are fighting in the war.

　　贾掌庆祝反攻会上翻身农民自报参战
    【本报长治讯】二区贾掌村二十八日召开了全村千余人会议，首先给大家报告了全面反攻的胜利消息，又报告了蒋介石的三大败亡原因，在这热潮中提出“全面发动大反攻，自愿参战刨老根”的口号，王虎山首先发言：“我今年二十四岁啦，正在青年时候，我家已翻身，村里揭了小石板，我想还得继续揭大石板，帮助蒋管区的农民翻身，剿蒋介石的老窝！”孟双全说：“我家里弟兄三个，我大哥和我三弟早已参加八路军七八年啦，他们已立了功，今天我自愿报名参战，要刨老根，还要争取立功。”王保只说：“以前我家很穷，没人看的起，现在翻了身，有吃有穿啦，还要继续打老蒋保饭碗。”他哥保才说：“你今天自愿参战，为了保咱自己的饭碗，我希望你立功回来，咱才高兴呀！”当下有十八名群众自动报名。郝鸡孩说：“参战为了刨老根，这次你们头前走，再次我们随后跟。”许多妇女也争说要帮忙解决家中经常困难，都说前后方大变工，先收先耕参战人的地。
