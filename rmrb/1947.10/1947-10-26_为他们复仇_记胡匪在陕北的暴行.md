Avenge Them
    ——Remember the Atrocities of the Bandit Hu in Northern Shaanxi
    Liu Hong
    This article contains records that the author personally heard on the front lines of Northern Shaanxi. He sent the manuscript to us from distant northwestern Shanxi, requesting that readers in faraway places understand the enemy's brutality. Now, as the national counter-offensive is in full swing, Northern Shaanxi has also entered the counter-offensive phase. The soldiers and civilians of Northern Shaanxi are demanding retribution from the bandit Hu for their blood debts. In addition to expressing our gratitude to the author, we firmly stand with all readers to avenge our suffering parents, brothers, and sisters.

    　　　　"Kill him!"
    At noon, the People's Liberation Army passed through Lian Dao Wan (Sickle Bay) in Ansai County, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. As soon as the troops reached the village entrance, they saw two girls lying by the roadside. The ground and their trousers were stained with fresh red blood, and they were crying hoarsely. Hearing the sound of the troops, they immediately turned their heads and cried out, "Come and save us!" The company commander and soldiers went over and asked painfully, "What happened to you?" They said sadly, "We were ravaged by the die-hard troops and can't move!" The company commander and soldiers immediately helped them up and put their trousers back on.
    Then, they recounted their ordeal. One girl was named Li Qiao'er, eighteen years old; the other was Shi Gaihua, seventeen years old. After breakfast this morning, more than a dozen Chiang soldiers grabbed them and gang-raped them until noon before running away. Shi Gaihua also mentioned that last night, an entire company of Chiang soldiers gang-raped two daughters-in-law and three daughters of Li Shengde's family, the beasts raping them all night until they could no longer move.
    After hearing this, the company commander said indignantly, "We'll capture them, and you can kill them!"
    "Kill them!" they said through gritted teeth.
    "Good! You can't move now, so we'll send you home to recuperate first, and then you can take revenge later!" The company commander then sent two donkeys to take them home. Before leaving, they firmly stated, "When we're well, we'll personally kill them!"
    　　　　"Comrades! My sheep have all been slaughtered!"
    Old Man Zhou sat on the ground at the village entrance, his brow furrowed and tears streaming down his face. Seeing our troops walking on the road, he cried out loudly, "Comrades! My sheep have all been slaughtered!"
    Crying, he walked up to the soldiers and complained, "Wherever the die-hard troops go, there's no way for people to live! They implement the 'seven all' policy: looting all the food and property, burning all the houses and timber, taking all the young people, eating all the grain and livestock, raping all the women, digging up everything buried, and slaughtering livestock and people! Look! Roads, rivers, wells, and mountain ridges are full of intestines and stomachs, blood flows like a river, and there are too many flies! All the chickens, dogs, cattle, donkeys, and sheep in this village are gone! The land reform gave me sheep, and I had two hundred of them, all slaughtered!"
    　　　　"Cow dung @ in the vegetable vat!"
    Old Man Zhou asked our soldiers to go to his house to take a look. Walking into the courtyard, the first thing they saw was that the jujube trees had been chopped down, and the doors and windows were burned clean. The Chiang soldiers mixed the millet they couldn't take away into the manure pile.
    Entering the cave dwelling, they couldn't see any wooden furniture, not a single piece of cloth, and the mat on the bed had also been burned. Only half a woman's shoe, burned, was left on the bed. Pots, basins, bowls, bottles, lamps, kettles, etc., were smashed into pieces, covering the ground.
    There was only one vegetable vat placed in the rear right corner. Old Man Zhou pointed and said, "Comrades! Look!"
    The soldiers crowded around the vat and saw a layer of human excrement floating inside. Old Man Zhou said angrily:
    "Cow dung and excrement @ in the vegetable vat!"
    　　　　"They call abuse love!"
    On the walls of the Lian Dao Wan village, our soldiers also saw large character slogans that read: "The National Army loves the people," "The National Army doesn't scold or beat people," "The National Army treats the people who return home to live in peace favorably," and so on.
    The soldiers then asked local villager Shi Yongsheng about the "National Army's love for the people." Shi Yongsheng said that when the Chiang soldiers arrived in the village, the people all fled. To lure the people back, the Chiang soldiers began to implement a trick in early July, using small favors to buy off the temporarily confused masses. Whoever returned home would receive 10,000 Chiang currency and five feet of cloth. Shi Yongsheng returned to the village, and the Chiang soldiers in this village went to the West River Estuary to rob the people of grain and cloth, and returned to give each of the villagers in Lian Dao Wan 10,000 yuan and five feet of cloth. However, the next night, the Chiang soldiers from the West River Estuary came to Lian Dao Wan to rob again. Shi Yongsheng's 10,000 yuan and five feet of cloth were robbed, and two buckets of millet and half a catty of salt that he had dug out of the cellar were also robbed. Shi Yongsheng knew he had been deceived and was very angry. He went with the villagers to report to the Chiang army regiment commander, who said, "I'll investigate. If I find out, I'll execute him!"
    That night, the regimental commander ordered the soldiers to grab a villager from Gaoqiao. The soldiers arrested the farmer Gao Erhu, dressed him in a military uniform, and painted his face with a big clown face. At dawn, they dragged him to the big field for execution, calling all the people to watch. When Gao Erhu was shot dead on the ground, the regimental commander feigned, "Look how strict the National Army's discipline is. You must know that the National Army loves the people!" Finally, Shi Yongsheng waved his fist and said, "Damn it! They call abuse love!"
    　　　　"Grandpa! Chiang Kai-shek killed you!"
    When our troops were advancing on the hills near Lian Dao Wan, the soldiers pinched their noses and exclaimed, "It stinks!" Their eyes really couldn't bear to look! The hills were covered with piles of Chiang army soldiers who had starved to death, and crows stood densely all over the hills.
    At this moment, everyone heard crying again. Upon closer inspection, several villagers were crying on the opposite hill.
    Everyone walked over and saw an old man tied to a tree. His wife, daughter-in-law, and little grandson knelt on the ground, crying their hearts out. The twelve-year-old grandson kept shouting, "Grandpa! Chiang Kai-shek killed you!" The old man's abdomen was cut open, his intestines spilled onto the ground, and his head, body, and legs were covered with bayonet wounds.
    The soldiers' eyes blazed with anger, and they clenched their fists, listening to the old woman's sobbing account of the old man's tragic death: After the Chiang soldiers captured the old man, they asked him, "Where is the grain buried in the village?" He replied, "I don't know!" The Chiang soldiers tied him to a tree, and the old man spat saliva on the Chiang soldiers' faces, cursing loudly, "You beasts! You deserve to be cut into a thousand pieces!" The Chiang soldiers cursed, "Beat you, you old donkey!" and beat him with rifle butts. Then they asked, "Where do the Eighth Route Army live?" The old man glared at them, shouting with all his might, "There are many of them! They are everywhere!" Thereupon, the bayonets of the brutal bandits pierced the old man's abdomen.
    Now, his wife, daughter-in-law, and grandson are mourning this steadfast old man. The soldiers comforted them, "Don't cry, we will wipe out the Chiang army and avenge the old man!"

　　为他们复仇
    ——记胡匪在陕北的暴行
    刘洪
    这篇文章，是作者在陕北前线，亲眼听见的一些纪录，他老远的从晋西北给我们寄来了稿子，并来信说要求远方的读者了解那里敌人的残暴，现在全国大反攻击中，陕北亦进入了反攻，陕北军民正向胡匪讨还血债，我们除向作者遥致谢意外，并坚决和一切读者们站在一起，为我们一切受难的父母、兄弟、姐妹复仇。

    　　　　“打死他！”
    晌午的时候，人民解放军经过陕甘宁边区安塞县镰刀湾。部队一走到村头，就看见两个女孩子躺在路旁，地上和她们的裤子都是鲜红的血，嘴里嘶哑地哭着。她们听到人马的声音，立时转过头，疾呼：“快来救命呀！”连长和战士们走拢去，痛心地问：“你们怎么成了这个样子？”她们伤心地说：“顽固军糟蹋的我们不能动弹了呀！”连长和战士们立刻把她们拉起来，给穿好裤子。
    接着，她们叙述受害的经过。这两个女孩子，一个叫李巧儿，十八岁；另一个叫史盖花，十七岁。今天早饭后，十几个蒋军抓住了她们，一直轮奸到晌午才逃走了。史盖花又谈到昨天晚上蒋军一连人轮奸了李生德家两个儿媳三个女儿，野兽们整夜轮奸到她们不能行动。
    连长听后，愤慨地说：“我们把他们抓来，你们打死他！”
    “打死他！”她们咬紧牙根说。
    “好！现在你们不能动弹，先送你们回去休养，以后再报仇吧！”连长便派了两个毛驴送她们回家。临走时，她们坚决地表示：“等休养好了，我们要去亲手打死他们！”
    　　　　“同志！我的羊给杀光了！”
    周老汉坐在村口的地边上，愁眉不展地流着眼泪。看见我军在路上走，便大声哭叫：“同志！我的羊给杀光了！”
    他一边哭，一边走到战士们跟前，诉苦说：“顽固军到了那里，那里就没有人活的路！他们实行七光政策：把粮食财物抢光，房子木料烧光，年青人拉光，粮食牲口吃光，女人奸光，埋了的东西挖光，牲口和人杀光！你们看！路上、河里、井里、山峁上，到处是肠肠肚肚，血流成河，苍蝇更是多的太呀！这村里的鸡、狗、牛、驴、羊没有一个了！土地革命给我分的羊，揽到迩刻一满是二百只，都给杀光了！”
    　　　　“牛屎＠到菜缸里！”
    周老汉叫我军战士到他家里去看。走到院里，第一眼看见的是枣树被砍光了，门窗烧的一干二净，蒋军把带不走的小米搅到粪堆里。
    进了窑，看不见一样木头家具，没有一块布，铺的席子也被烧了，炕上只丢着一个烧的剩下半截的女人鞋子。锅、盆、碗、瓶子、灯、壶等，打成碎片，铺了一地。
    仅仅有一个菜缸放在右后角里，周老汉手一指说：“同志！你们看吧！”
    战士们挤在缸跟前，看见里面浮着一层人的粪便。周老汉气呼呼地说：
    “牛粪屎＠到菜缸里了！”
    　　　　“他们把糟踏叫爱护！”
    镰刀湾村庄的墙壁上，我军战士还看见那大字的标语，写着：“国军爱护老百姓”“国军不骂人不打人”“国军优待回家安居的老百姓”如此等等。
    战士们便找史永盛老乡询问“国军爱护老百姓”的情形。史永盛说，蒋军一到村里，老百姓都逃跑了。为着把老百姓骗了回去，蒋军于七月初便开始实行一种骗术，用小恩小惠来收买一时糊涂的群众，谁回家就给谁一万元蒋币和五尺布。史永盛回到村里来，这村的蒋军便到西河口去抢老百姓的粮食、布匹，回来给镰刀湾的老百姓一人一万元五尺布。可是，第二天晚上，西河口的蒋军又来镰刀湾抢劫，史永盛的一万元和五尺布给抢走了，并把他从地窖里挖出来的两斗小米、半斤盐也抢去了。史永盛知道受了骗，很气忿，便和村里人去报告蒋军团长，团长说：“我查一查，查出来枪毙他！”
    当天晚上，团长命令士兵到高桥去抓个老百姓，士兵即将农民高二虎抓去，给穿上军装，脸上抹成个大花脸。天一明，拉到大场子里执行枪毙，叫老百都去看。当高二虎打死在地上的时候，团长装腔作势地说：“你们看国军的纪律多严格，要晓得国军是爱护老百姓的！”最后，史永盛挥着拳头说：“狗日的！他们把糟踏叫做爱护！”
    　　　　“爷爷！蒋介石杀了你呀！”
    我军在镰刀湾附近的山头上行进的时候，战士们捏住鼻子叫：“真臭呀！”眼睛也实在不忍看啊！山头上各处堆着饿死的蒋军士兵，乌鸦也黑压压的站满了山头。
    这时，大家又听到哭声，留神一看，对面山头上几个老百姓在哭着。
    大家走过去，瞧见树上绑着一个老头。老婆婆、媳妇、小孙儿跪在地上哭成泪人儿，十二岁的小孙儿直叫着：“爷爷！蒋介石杀了你呀！”那老头的腹部被剖开，肠肚流到地上，头部、身上、腿上布满了刺刀眼。
    战士们眼睛里放出怒火，捏紧拳头，听着老婆婆上气不接下气地哭诉老汉惨死的经过：蒋军抓到老头以后，问他：“村里粮食埋在那里？”他回答：“不知道！”蒋军便把他绑在树上，老头子用力把唾沫吐到蒋军的脸上，大骂道：“你们这些野兽！应该千刀万剐的东西！”蒋军一面骂：“打死你老驴日的！”一面就是一顿枪托的乱打。随后又问：“八路军住在哪里？”老头子怒目而视，声嘶力竭地喊：“多的很！到处都是！”于是，残暴的匪徒们的刺刀穿入了老汉的腹部。
    现在，他的老婆婆、儿媳、孙儿，在痛哭着这位坚贞的老人，战士们安慰他们：“不要哭了，我们要把蒋军消灭干净，为老汉报仇！”
