　　Xia County First District
　　Poor and Hired Peasants Unite to Pour Out Grievances, Promoting Spontaneous Struggle
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 4th] The promotion of spontaneous struggle in the First District of Xia County has developed from points to the whole area. The comrades working in the First District, in their visits to hear grievances, went through a difficult struggle process, entering homes when doors were open and visiting ancestral temples, seeking out the most aggrieved people. Then, the aggrieved people were connected with other aggrieved people in the same village and outside villages, or the seeds of united struggle were sown, pushing the struggle to the whole area. After Shima Village organized three to four thousand people on August 20th to jointly struggle against the great local tyrant Wang Xisheng and the assassination团长姚文新 [head of the assassination group Yao Wenxin], it promoted Taijiabao, Xiqin, Xinnan and other villages to brew and launch struggles. Furthermore, united struggles were continuously launched. Yan Zhao Village organized more than a thousand people, Li Village organized a united struggle of three natural villages, and Sanxianzhuang organized a visiting struggle of seven villages, rapidly expanding the movement to all directions. The most effective promotion of spontaneous struggle was the joint grievance pouring meeting of poor and hired peasants from fourteen villages on August 21st. More than three hundred and forty hired and poor peasants participated in the meeting. At the meeting, advanced villages promoted backward villages, and aggrieved people mobilized aggrieved people. The flood of grievances poured out, continuing for two days, becoming more and more bitter as they poured out, and the momentum of the struggle grew stronger. For example, Zhao Yu of Xiqin said, "The meat eaten by landlords is the meat of the poor, and the wine drunk by landlords is the blood of the poor." Old Dong of Li Village said, "We must overthrow the landlords and local tyrants, even if they are like Mount Tai." On September 2nd, the aggrieved people of each village went back to seize the objects of struggle and start struggles. By the 8th, all villages in the district had automatically launched struggles.

　　夏县一区
  　贫雇联合诉苦推动自发斗争
    【本报太岳四日电】夏县一区推动自发斗争，已由点发展到面。一区工作同志在访苦中，经过一段艰苦奋斗的过程，见破门就进，见家庙就访，访见最苦的人，再由苦人串通本村苦人与外村苦人，或采用联合斗争播下种子，将斗争推向全面。师马村于八月二十日，三四千人联合斗争大恶霸王喜圣与暗杀团长姚文新后，推动了泰家堡、西秦、辛南等村也酝酿搞开斗争，并且接连的推开联合斗争，阎赵村组织了千余人，李庄组织了三个自然村的联合斗争，三贤庄组织了七个村的参观斗争，迅速将运动向四外纵横扩展。推动自发斗争最有效的为八月二十一日十四个村的贫雇联合诉苦大会，参加此会的雇贫有三百四十余人，会中先进村推动落后村，苦人动员苦人，苦水涌来，一直诉了两天，越诉越苦，斗争劲气也越大。如西秦赵玉说：“地主吃的肉，是穷人的肉，地主喝的酒，就是穷人的血。”李庄村老董说：“地主恶霸就是泰山也要把他推倒。”九月二日各村苦人都回去抓斗争对象，搞斗争，至八日，全区各村都自动搞开了斗争。
