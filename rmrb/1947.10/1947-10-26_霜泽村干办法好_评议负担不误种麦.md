　　Shuangze Village Cadres Have Good Methods
  　Assessing Burdens Does Not Delay Wheat Planting
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch on the 20th] Tunliu's Shuangze Village created the experience of assessing burdens within mutual aid groups. On the first day of the eighth lunar month, the director of finance of Shuangze Village conveyed the methods for calculating and deducting this year's burdens at a cadre meeting. Comrade Hao Shuangjin, chairman of the Farmers' Association, proposed: "To save manpower and ensure that the burden assessment is done well without affecting wheat planting, our village cadres must go deep into the mutual aid groups." Everyone agreed that this was correct. Therefore, the extremely scarce land and standard yields of the entire village were determined. Cadre members then participated in mutual aid group activities. They used their rest time to chat about burden calculation and deduction methods. During the midday break, they reported their population, land, and yields. The mutual aid group leader was the leader of the yield assessment group. Committee members connected with each other every night to exchange opinions. In exchanging experiences and studying problems, they did not hold mass meetings but mainly small meetings. If a decision needed to be made, they would take turns announcing it from one group to another. Each committee member and cadre listened to the masses' feedback within the group. If there were any opinions, they were corrected in a timely manner, and the people's opinions were gathered to calculate scores and solve problems. As a result, the entire village saved more than 500 workdays and was able to plant 250 mu of wheat, achieving the goal of not delaying both the burden assessment and wheat planting work.

　　霜泽村干办法好
  　评议负担不误种麦
    【本报太岳二十日电】屯留霜泽村，创造互助组内评负担经验，阴历八月初一日，霜泽村财政主任在干部会上，传达了今年负担计算与扣除的办法后，农会主席郝双金同志提出：“要节省民力，做到把负担办好，又不影响种麦，咱村干部必须深入到互助组。”大家认为很对，于是确定了全村的极罕地与标准产量，干部委员就分别参加互助组动弹，利用休息时间，闲谈负担计算和扣除办法，歇晌吃饭时，自报人口、土地产量，互助组长即是评议产量小组长，委员们每天黑夜接头交换意见，在交流经验与研究问题上，不开群众大会，以小会为主，如有决定问题，便轮流公布，从一组到一组，各委员干部在组内听群众的反映，如有意见，及时纠正，集中群众意见计算分数，解决问题。全村因此省工五百多，能种麦二百五十亩，做到办负担与种麦工作两不误。
