　　【Gaoyi News from this Newspaper】In Gaoyi County, in order to strive for the early planting of 140,000 mu of wheat, the leadership is paying attention to solving the three major difficulties in wheat planting. Many villages, while planting wheat, discovered the lack of wheat seeds, livestock, and fertilizer. In order to solve the seed problem, all villages made statistics of wheat seeds in advance. For example, Mofang Village, in order to help hired laborers and poor people plant wheat, proposed "Everyone will not go hungry next year; let's help each other with wheat seeds now." Under this slogan, the village needed nine dan and five dou of wheat seeds, and eight dan and five dou were collected in one day to lend to the poor and hired laborers who lacked seeds, solving the difficulty of planting wheat. The Sunjiazhuang Cooperative purchased 28 dan and seven dou of wheat seeds and loaned them to the poor and hired laborers for planting wheat. Regarding the solution of animal power, some villages organized women and children to push the mill to grind flour, and all livestock were used to crash plant wheat. Sunjiazhuang Village loaned some of its funds to the masses to buy twelve head of livestock. In solving the fertilizer problem, in addition to some villages preparing to topdress in the coming spring, they also came up with various fertilization methods. The masses in Lijiazhuang Village exchanged the fruits of the struggle, oil, for the cooperative's damaged sesame cakes (inedible for humans), and according to the principle of dividing the fruits, divided them into five grades among the hired laborers and poor people, distributing the sesame cakes to each household, solving the fertilizer problem. Before planting wheat in Beijiao, the whole village launched a three-day crash fertilizer accumulation campaign (scraping grassland), solving the fertilizer problem for wheat planting in the whole village, applying four large carts of manure per mu. Sunjiazhuang Village applied the soil from collapsed houses and kang soil to the fields, and the whole village launched a street sweeping campaign to collect fertilizer, achieving the plan of two carts of manure per mu. After solving the three major difficulties, the masses in various villages were all involved in the upsurge of wheat planting. In order to crash plant, some villages in the Second District organized rush planting teams. In Xiqiu Village, men, women, old and young participated in the rush planting. The whole village organized three squadrons, with cadres participating in the leadership separately, specifically dividing the work according to the strength of the labor force, such as men plowing and hauling manure, and women raking the stubble. During the crash planting, the masses put forward the slogan "No visiting relatives, no going to market, no missing a day's work." Under the crash planting in the whole village, six qing and five mu were planted in four days. In Sijiazhuang, the masses went to the fields every day before dawn. Now the masses in the whole county are nervously rushing to plant according to the plan, and the whole county has full confidence in completing the planned 140,000 mu of wheat.

　　解决贫雇困难高邑突击种麦
    【本报高邑讯】高邑全县为争取十四万亩麦及早下种，领导上注意解决种麦三大困难。不少村在种麦当中，发现没麦种、没牲口、没肥料，为了解决种子困难，各村事先都将麦种作了统计，如磨房村为帮助雇佃贫都种上麦子，提出“明年大家不挨饿，现在互剂麦子种”，在这口号下，全村缺的九石五斗麦种，在一天中就调剂出八石五斗麦子，借给缺种贫雇，解决了种麦困难。孙家庄合作社，购买了二十八石七斗麦种贷给贫雇种麦子。在畜力解决上，有些村庄组织了妇女儿童推碾磨面，牲口全部突击种麦，孙家庄村将存的一部款贷给群众买了十二头牲口。在解决肥料上，除一部村庄准备明春上追肥外，也想出了各种施肥办法。李家庄群众将斗争果实油换了合作社的坏麻饼（人不能吃），以分果实的原则，在雇佃贫中分为五等，将麻饼发给各个户，解决了肥料困难。北焦在种麦前，全村突击积肥三天（刮草地），解决了全村种麦的肥料，每亩上粪四大车。孙家庄将落房土炕土等上到地里，全村又开展了扫街集肥运动，达到了一亩地两车粪的计划。解决三大困难以后，各村群众即全部卷入种麦高潮。为了突击下种，二区一部村庄组织了抢种突击队。西邱村男女老少参加了抢种，全村组织了三个中队，干部分头参加领导，按劳力强弱具体分工，如男人耕种拉粪，妇女搂茬子。在突击抢种中群众提出“不走亲、不赶集、不误一天工”的口号，在全村突击下，四天下种六顷五亩。寺家庄每天天不明群众便上了地。现在全县群众，都在紧张的按计划抢种着，全县对完成预定的十四万亩麦子计划，有充分信心。
