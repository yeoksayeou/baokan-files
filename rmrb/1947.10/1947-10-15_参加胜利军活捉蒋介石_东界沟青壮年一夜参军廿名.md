　　Joining the Victory Army to Capture Chiang Kai-shek Alive
　　Twenty Young People from Dongjiegou Enlist Overnight
　　[Our Newspaper] Before the conscription mobilization meeting in the Third District of Bo'ai County had even concluded, Dongjiegou had already successfully completed its quota of twenty men overnight. At the meeting of activists and people's meritorious workers, the chairman of the farmers' association said: "Our liberation depends on ourselves. We must seize and defend our own land." How do we defend our land? To defend it, we must rise up ourselves to protect it. How do we protect it? Everyone answered: "Enlist!" And shouted: "Many people make great strength, enlist and seize the world!" They also shouted: "If we take Jiaozuo, we will have coal to burn, and we won't have to cut firewood and burn stalks!" He then asked: If we can't eliminate the bad guys, can we live in peace? No! What do we do? Everyone said in unison: "Enlist!" Who goes? "Good young men!" Which young men go? On the spot, twenty-one men rushed forward to sign up. The masses shouted: "Defend the treasure bowl, good young men join the Victory Army!" "To truly turn over, enlist and dig up the old roots!" One young man said: "After I leave, please take care of my family." Everyone said: "Don't worry, we will definitely take good care of them." Then, two brothers happily signed up with guns, saying: "We want to join the Victory Army!" Under the influence of the Dongjiegou "locomotive," the cadres of Shuitun Village returned overnight and completed their quota of ten men overnight. On the morning of the 20th, the masses in Dongjiegou celebrated the new soldiers with gongs and drums, with a big red flag in the front, which read "Victory Army of the Counter-Offensive." Seeing that the situation was not right, the cadres of Shuitun Village, fearing falling behind Dongjiegou, rushed back without eating, called the new soldiers from their village, and crowded into the meeting place together, comforting them and saying: "We were not prepared in advance, so you have to endure a little hardship. When you leave, we will give you a good send-off!" The Victory Army comrades, wearing white towels and big red flowers on their chests, entered the meeting place, and the masses welcomed them onto the platform of honor, shouting: "Young comrades have good spirit, kill the enemy on the front line and protect the home!" "You make great contributions on the front line, and we will take care of everything at home!"
　　[Another News Item] Luo Chi, a hired farm worker from Yanfenzhuang in the Second District, went to Xuliang to the market. He heard that a conscription meeting was being held in Xiasuimo. He recalled that after working as a farmhand for more than ten years, he still had no house or land. Now that he had turned over and had a house and land, he had to protect it. So, he ran from Xuliang to Xiasuimo and rushed to the meeting to sign up, saying: "I have worked as a farmhand for more than ten years and suffered for more than ten years. Now the Eighth Route Army is leading me to turn over. I am determined to enlist and fight Jiaozuo, so that everyone has coal to burn. I also want to fight Xinxiang, cross the Yellow River, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and bring him back for everyone to see!" (Bo'ai Great Turn-Over Newspaper)
