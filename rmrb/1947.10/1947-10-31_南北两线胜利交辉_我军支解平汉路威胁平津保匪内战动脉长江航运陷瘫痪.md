　　Victories on Northern and Southern Fronts Shine Brightly
　　Our Army Dissects the Pinghan Railway, Threatening the Beiping-Tianjin-Baoding Bandit Internal War Artery; Yangtze River Shipping Paralyzed
    In the past week (October 23rd to 29th), great victories have been frequently reported on both the northern and southern fronts, especially the two great victories in the Qingfengdian area southwest of Baoding on the northern front and the Qi (Chun) Guang (Ji) area on the north bank of the Yangtze River on the southern front.

    Jinchaji Battlefield: In order to powerfully coordinate with the Northeast offensive, our People's Liberation Army launched a strong counter-offensive on the Pingbao section of the Pinghan Railway. With a stunning victory, on the 20th to 22nd, near Qingfengdian, ninety miles southwest of Baoding, they annihilated the entire Third Army Headquarters of the Chiang bandits, including the entire Seventh Division under its command, and the entire 66th Regiment of the 16th Army, totaling more than 13,000 people, including the captured Third Army Lieutenant General Commander Luo Lireong, Lieutenant General Deputy Commander Yang Guangyu, Major General Commander of the Seventh Division Li Yongzhang, and all officers and soldiers below, totaling 10,465 people, setting a new record for the Jinchaji battlefield of resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and massively annihilating the enemy. This victory began just the day after the Chiang bandit convened a military meeting in Beiping (October 19th), no less than a loud and heavy slap in the face to the Chiang bandit. During the same period, in the offensive in the Beiping-Tianjin-Baoding triangle area, the People's Liberation Army successively captured the four cities of Rongcheng, Xiongxian, Baxian, and Xinzhen, as well as many stations such as Songlindian and Caohe, dissecting the northern section of the Pinghan Railway and recovering the vast area north of the Daqing River, posing a serious threat to Ping, Tianjin, and Baoding, making Chiang bandit's wishful thinking of drawing troops from here to rescue the Northeast a pipe dream.

    Northeast Battlefield: The Democratic Allied Army continued to expand its offensive and annihilate the enemy with a calm and mobile pace. In the battle to capture Dehui on the 20th, the Northern Route Allied Army annihilated more than 1,000 Chiang local troops, including a regimental commander and below. In the Jilin-Changchun area, between the 15th and 18th, more than 3,800 Chiang troops from the 52nd Division and other units were annihilated. On the Eastern Front, between the 16th and 20th, the Allied Army annihilated more than 800 Chiang Youth Army 207th Division and other units on the outskirts of Fushun, and repelled a large number of Chiang bandits who came to aid from Fushun with airplanes and armored vehicles. On the Southern Front, the Jireliao People's Liberation Army captured Chaoyang City on the 23rd, annihilating a total of more than 1,700 Chiang Fu troops, controlling more than 500 miles between Pingquan and Yixian on the Jin-Cheng Railway, and the vast area on both sides, forcing Chen Cheng to shrink into a small number of data points between Shenyang and Jilin, not daring to engage. The Chiang troops trapped in Changchun, Siping, and Fushun had to rely on air transport for relief. The rear of the Allied Army is carrying out a enthusiastic movement to join the army and train soldiers, constantly strengthening and improving combat effectiveness.

    Hubei-Henan-Anhui Battlefield: The People's Liberation Army swept through the eastern Hubei and western Anhui areas. On the 20th, part of our army annihilated more than 600 Chiang Youth Army 203rd Division west of Guangji. Between the 20th and 22nd, they successively liberated Wangjiang, recovered the five cities of Yingshan, Guangji, Huangmei, and Susong, and captured the two important river defense strongholds of Huayang Town southeast of Wangjiang and Wuxue Town southeast of Qichun, controlling more than 300 miles of river defense on the north bank of the Yangtze River, ready to cross the river south at any time and attack the Chiang bandit's lair directly. It also paralyzed the Yangtze River shipping, the artery of the Chiang bandits' internal war, causing the Chiang family bandit gang to panic. They hurriedly adjusted all of the 40th Division (missing one regiment) and all of the 82nd Brigade of the 52nd Division, totaling one division headquarters, two brigade headquarters, and five regiments, from Gangxiang to Guangji for reinforcement. They were surrounded by the People's Liberation Army in the area bordering Qi (Chun) and Guang (Ji). After two days of fierce fighting, they were all annihilated on the 27th, creating an unprecedented victory in the Hubei-Henan-Anhui area with a large number of enemy annihilated. Frightened, the Chiang bandit hurriedly announced simultaneous martial law at all ports between Hankou and Jiujiang, and sent Chiang's Navy Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing to Jiujiang to direct escort (United Press). The Chiang bandit also panicked and flew to Guling on the 27th to personally direct the battle (Reuters).

    Northwest Battlefield: A part of the People's Liberation Army, which had wedged into the rear of the Chiang Hu army, captured Yichuan County, a military and transportation stronghold on the border of Shaanxi and Shanxi, on the 21st, annihilating all of the defending Chiang Yichuan Command, one regiment of the Sichuan Army, one regiment and one company of the Hu Army, and more than 4,000 Chiang Sanxian police teams, including important officials such as Chiang's Lieutenant General Commander Xu Yongxiu and Yichuan Major General County Chief Xu Pei. This victory posed a great threat to the Chiang Hu isolated army trapped in northern Shaanxi.

    Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Battlefield: The People's Liberation Army moved back and forth to capture the Chiang bandits, and continued to expand its positions. On the 18th, it entered Fugou and Yanling in eastern Henan for the third time. On the 21st, it liberated Xiangcheng. The defending enemies of the three cities were all large Chiang ground troops, who did not dare to confront and fled upon hearing the news. On the 23rd, the People's Liberation Army captured Zhoujiakou, a military, transportation, and commercial town in eastern Henan, with a surprise attack. All of the defending Chiang two security regiments, police stations, and "Homecoming Corps," totaling more than 1,120 people, were annihilated. On the same day, another unit south of Zhoujiakou defeated the Chiang bandit 1st Cavalry Brigade, which came to aid from Shangshui City, annihilating and capturing more than 800 of them. Taking advantage of the victory, Shangshui City was liberated. On the 22nd and 23rd, part of our army once again recovered Xuefeng (Yongcheng) and recovered Taihe for the second time. Another unit captured Chenliu County, forty-five miles southeast of Kaifeng, on the 26th, annihilating all of the defending Henan Province Bao Yi and Bao Er regiments.

    East China Battlefield: The People's Liberation Army launched widespread attacks, and the Chiang bandit army was beaten everywhere. The Jiaodong People's Liberation Army captured Sunshou southwest of Laiyang and Dongxiagezhuang on the 16th, annihilating 1,600 Chiang officers and soldiers below the regimental commander. The enemy's counterattack on Weishi was repeatedly frustrated. As of the 14th, more than 700 people had been killed or injured, and Weishi remained unmoved. The Lunan People's Liberation Army and local armed forces recovered Zaozhuang, a famous coal area and military stronghold, on the 24th, annihilating more than 500 enemies. The Northern Jiangsu People's Liberation Army recovered Wulizhuang and Dingjiaji on the Huai (yin) Shu (yang) Highway on the 25th, annihilating more than 600 enemies and controlling more than 120 miles of the Huai-Shu Highway. For "discussing the deteriorating military situation in Shandong" (Associated Press), the Chiang bandit flew to Qingdao to hold a meeting of senior generals. In order to cover up the defeat of the Chiang army in East China, even the news from Qingdao by the Associated Press reporter was withheld.

    Yu-Shaan Battlefield: In the newly liberated areas along the Longhai Railway, the Chiang bandits have been largely eliminated. The local people have established organizations to turn over and defend themselves. The People's Liberation Army and the democratic government are using the gap between battles to help the people stabilize the democratic order and carry out the anti-Chiang revenge and food distribution movement. The Taiyue District has also sent 800 cadres to the area to help with construction.

    In addition to assisting the main force in combat, the local armed forces in various battlefields have also achieved repeated victories in independent attacks. Parts of the Taiyue and Lvliang local corps annihilated more than 800 Yan troops from the 15th to 18th and recovered Xiangling City. The Luzhong Backbone Corps recovered Linqu City on the 20th and annihilated part of the enemy. The Binhai Local Corps captured Shahe Town, northwest of Donghai, on the 21st, annihilating more than 500 enemies.

专栏：一周综合战报

　　南北两线胜利交辉
  　我军支解平汉路威胁平津保匪内战动脉长江航运陷瘫痪
    本周（二十三日至二十九日）来，南北战线频告大捷，尤以北线保定西南清风店地区与南线长江北岸蕲（春）广（济）地区之两大胜利，最为辉煌。
    晋察冀战场：我解放军为有力配合东北攻势，于平汉线平保段发动强大反攻，以一鸣惊人之胜利，于二十至二十二日，在保定西南九十里之清风店附近，一举聚歼由石家庄北调救援保垣之蒋匪第三军军部及所辖第七师全部，与十六军二十三师六十六团全部，共计一万三千余人，内生俘第三军中将军长罗历戎、中将副军长杨光钰、第七师少将师长李用章等以下全部官佐及士兵一万零四百六十五人，创晋察冀战场坚决彻底干净大量歼敌之新纪录。此一胜战，恰好开始于蒋贼在北平召开军事会议（十九日）之次日，不啻给蒋贼打了一记响亮而沉重的耳光。同一时期，解放军在平津保三角地区攻势中，先后克容城、雄县、霸县、新镇四城及松林店、漕河等车站多处，将平汉北段加以支解，并收复大清河北广大地区，予平、津、保以严重威胁，使蒋贼原拟由此抽兵救援东北之如意算盘，成为泡影。
    东北战场：民主联军以沉着机动的步调继续扩展攻势，歼灭敌人。北线联军于二十日攻克德惠之役，全歼蒋地方军一个团团长以下千余人。吉长地区十五至十八日间，先后歼蒋五二师等部三千八百余名。东线联军十六日至二十日间，在抚顺外围歼蒋青年军二○七师等部八百余名。并击退由抚顺配以飞机、装甲车出援之大股蒋匪。南线冀察热辽解放军，于二十三日攻克朝阳城，歼蒋傅军共一千七百余名，控制锦承路平（泉）义（县）间五百余里，及两侧广大地区，迫使陈诚龟缩沈吉间少数据点内，不敢交锋。困踞长春、四平、抚顺之蒋军，只得仰赖空运救济。联军之后方，正开展热烈参军与练兵运动，不断壮大与提高战斗力。
    鄂豫皖战场：解放军横扫鄂东皖西地区，二十日我军一部于广济以西歼蒋青年军二○三师六百余名，于二十至二十二日间，先后解放望江，收复英山、广济、黄梅、宿松五城，并攻克望江东南之华阳镇与蕲春东南之武穴镇两江防要地，控制长江北岸江防三百余里，随时可渡江南下，直捣蒋匪巢穴。并使蒋匪内战动脉之长江航运瘫痪，蒋家匪帮惊恐万状，忙调整四十师（缺一个团）全部及五十二师之八二旅全部，共计一个师部、两个旅部及五个团的兵力，由冈向广济增援，被解放军包围于蕲（春）广（济）交界地区，经两日激战，于二十七日将其全部歼灭，创鄂豫皖地区大量歼敌之空前胜利。吓得蒋匪急忙宣布汉口九江间各口岸同时戒严，并派蒋记海军总司令桂永清亲至九江指挥护航（合众社），蒋贼亦慌惶于二十七日飞牯岭，亲自指挥作战（路透社）。
    西北战场：楔入蒋胡军后方之解放军一部，于二十一日一举攻克陕晋边军事与交通要地宜川县城，全歼守敌蒋记宜川指挥部、川军一个团、胡军一个团又一个连，及蒋记三县保警队等四千余，蒋记中将指挥官许用修宜川少将县长徐沛等重要官员全部就俘。此一胜利，给困守陕北之蒋胡孤军以莫大威胁。
    苏鲁豫皖战场：解放军往来机动捕捉蒋匪，并继续扩张阵地，十八日第三次进驻豫东之扶沟、鄢陵，二十一日解放项城，三城守敌均为蒋地大部队，不敢当锋，闻讯逃逸。二十三日解放军以奇袭攻克豫东军事交通与商业重镇周家口，守敌蒋记两个保安团、警察所及“还乡团”等一千一百二十余人，全部就歼。同日，另部在周家口以南击溃由商水城出援之蒋匪骑一旅，歼俘其八百余。乘胜解放商水城。二十二、二十三日，我军一部再度光复雪枫（永城），二次收复太和。另部二十六日一举攻克开封东南四十五里之陈留县城，全歼守敌河南省保一保二两个团。
    华东战场：解放军广泛出击，蒋匪军处处挨打。胶东解放军于十六日攻克莱阳西南之孙受、东夏格庄之役，歼蒋团长以下官兵一千六百余名。反扑威市之敌，连遭挫败，迄十四日止，已死伤七百余人，威市屹然未动。鲁南解放军与地方武装于二十四日一举收复著名煤区与军事要地枣庄，歼敌五百余。苏北解放军于二十五日收复淮（阴）沭（阳）公路上之五里庄、丁家集两地，歼敌六百余，控制淮沭公路一百二十余里。为“讨论已呈恶化的山东军事形势”（美联社语），蒋贼曾飞青岛召开高级将领会议。为掩盖华东蒋军之败迹，连美联社记者由青岛发出的新闻，亦遭到扣押。
    豫陕战场：陇海沿线新解放地区，蒋匪已大体肃清，当地群众纷纷建立翻身与自卫组织，解放军与民主政府正利用战斗间隙，帮助群众安定民主秩序，开展反蒋复仇与分粮分田运动。太岳区又派八百干部前往该地帮助建设。
    各战场地方武装除协助主力作战外，在单独出击中，亦迭获胜利。太岳、吕梁地方兵团各一部，于十五至十八日歼阎军八百余，收复襄陵城。鲁中基干兵团于二十日收复临朐城，歼敌一部。滨海地方兵团于二十一日攻克东海西北之沙河镇，歼敌五百余。
