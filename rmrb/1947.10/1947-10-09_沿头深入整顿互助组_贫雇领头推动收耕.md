Penetratingly Rectify Mutual Aid Teams at Yantou
Poor and Hired Peasants Lead the Drive to Harvest and Plant

[Reported by this newspaper from Shexian] Yantou Village in Shexian's First District, through thoroughly rectifying mutual aid teams with poor and hired peasants, is launching a concentrated effort in the autumn harvest and wheat planting, and preparing for a major review after the autumn harvest. Yantou is a production base in Shexian. During land reform review, poor and hired peasants were not established as leaders, landlords were not thoroughly struggled against, and the class line in mutual aid during production was not clear enough. This spring, when organizing the New Democratic Mutual Aid Society, village cadres thought: "Poor people have a bad history, are prone to stealing and causing trouble, and are not active in production." They excluded them, but seeing that the landlord Zhang Yongde was poorly dressed, they absorbed him into the mutual aid team. The New Democratic Mutual Aid Society had a total of 187 households, including 172 middle peasant households (including 70 new middle peasant households), 15 poor peasant households, and 6 landlord households. Landlords in the mutual aid society owned 984,600 yuan in shares. Of the 38 women in the textile department, 10 were landlords. Landlords even brought land into the team for cultivation, earning wages and also receiving dividends equivalent to their land contribution. The team fertilized and hoed their land, and landlords still exploited peasants by taking half of the harvest. Poor peasants lacked necessary farm tools, and village cadres did not take charge of this issue. Therefore, only some middle peasants were active on the production front, while landlords benefited, and poor and hired peasants were resentful. Based on the above situation, leaders went deep among the poor and hired peasants to talk with them and understand their thoughts. The poor peasant Zhang Yukun said: "In the past, poor people couldn't survive. Taking someone's melon, eggplant, or gourd would lead to a lifelong debt. Now that we have turned over, cadres constantly say that we have a bad history and exclude us." Liu Zhongyi reflected: "I used to be quick-tongued, and when I said Zhang Sanyuan shouldn't be allocated fruit, the cadre asked me to confess and write a self-criticism. I'm only forty years old this year, but I have a beard. Luckily, when I speak, touching my beard reminds me of the consequences of being quick-tongued." Encouraged and supported, the poor peasants exposed the facts of the disguised landlord cadre (Director of the Armed Committee) Zhang Sanyuan encroaching on fruit, and the landlord Zhang Yanfa using 180,000 yuan in shares to treat the mutual aid society as an air-raid shelter. Leaders used the opinions and demands raised by poor peasants to encourage cadres to reflect. The director of civil education, after ideological struggle, began to reflect: "Last winter during land reform, I listened to the middle peasants who didn't want to struggle, and thought that it was better to get rich through production, so why continue the struggle? I then focused on mutual aid and side occupations, abandoning the task of helping people turn over." The cooperative leader said: "When I mobilized poor peasants to participate in mutual aid, they were unwilling to actively participate, so I thought they were naturally unsupportable. Later, I only united with middle peasants and excluded poor and hired peasants." The public security officer confessed: "I once beat up a military family member for stealing a watermelon, and if an honest peasant said something unsatisfactory, I would accuse him of 'sabotage.' This made the poor and hired peasants further away from us." The chairman of the peasant association and the production director also confessed to their "consistent contempt for poor peasants" and other erroneous ideas. After examining their positions, all cadres began to turn around and make self-criticisms to the masses. At a family meeting of cadres and poor peasants, they expressed their attitude and admitted that they had taken the wrong path. The peasants immediately proposed to remove the director of the Armed Committee, Zhang Sanyuan, from his post and demanded the return of all the fruit he had received. The landlords' funds in the mutual aid society were confiscated and handed over to the masses. The landlords' tobacco and indigo were harvested by the peasants. Poor and hired peasants Zhang Siming, Liu Zhongyi, and Zhang Dejin were elected to form a management committee to register and manage the funds, to be distributed uniformly during the major review after the autumn harvest. With poor and hired peasants as the backbone, a public security team was established to monitor and control the landlords. Finally, everyone proposed that in order to welcome the major review after the autumn harvest, they should accelerate the completion of the autumn harvest and wheat planting, setting a plan to strive for a clean harvest in twenty days.

　　沿头深入整顿互助组
  　贫雇领头推动收耕
    【本报涉县讯】涉县一区沿头村，深入贫雇整顿互助突击秋收种麦，并给秋后大复查作了准备。沿头是涉县生产基点，土改复查中，都没有树立贫雇领导，地主没斗透，生产中互助的阶级路线也不够明确，今春组织新民主主义互助社，村干部认为：“贫苦群众历史不好，好偷的惹事，生产不积极”。排斥他们，反而看见地主张永德穿的坏，便吸收参加互助组。新民主主义互助社共一百八十七户，内有中农一百七十二户（包括新中农七十户）贫农十五户，还有六户地主。互助社中地主拥有股金九十八万四千六百元。纺织部三十八个妇女有十个是地主。地主并把土地带到组内耕种，除赚工资还等价分红，组内给他上粪锄地，收获半分，依然剥削农民。贫农缺乏必要农具，村干也不给作主，因之活跃在生产战线的只有一部分中农，地主沾光，贫雇闷气。根据以上情况，领导上便深入贫雇谈心思话。贫农张玉昆说：“以往穷人没法过，拿人家个瓜茄葫芦，就成了一辈子短病，如今翻了身，干部动不动就说咱历史不好，把咱撇在门外”。刘中义反映：“平时我嘴快，说了声张三元不该分果实，干部就叫我坦白写悔过书。咱今年只四十岁就留下胡子，好在说话时一摸胡子，就能想起嘴快受过制”。在对贫农撑腰启发下，大家揭发化形地主干部（武委会主任）张三元侵夺果实，及地主张言法入股十八万把互助社当防空洞等事实。领导上把贫农提出的意见和要求，来启发干部反省，民教主任经过思想斗争开始反省：“去冬土改时，我听了中农说不愿斗争，就想到生产能发家，何必再斗争。我便抓紧互助搞副业，放弃搞翻身”。合作社长说：“我动员贫农参加互助，他不肯积极参加，我就想天生扶不起来，以后便只团结中农，把贫雇关在门外了。”公安员检讨：“曾因偷一颗西瓜吊打军属，对老实农民说句不满的话，便追他‘破坏’，这样贫雇农便离咱越远了。”农会主任生产主任也检讨了：“一贯看不起贫农”等错误思想。全体干部经过检查立场，开始回过头来向群众检讨。在干部与贫农召开的一家人会上，表明了态度，承认自己走错了路线。农民当场提出罢免武委会主任张三元，并将他分得的果实全部要出，互助社里地主的资金没收交群众，地主的烟、靛由农民收割，并选出贫雇张思明、刘中义、张德金等成立保管委员会，登记保管，待秋后大复查时统一分配，并以贫雇为骨干，成立了治安小组，监视管制地主。最后大家提出为了迎接秋后大复查，要加紧完成秋收种麦，订了计划，争取二十天场光地净。
