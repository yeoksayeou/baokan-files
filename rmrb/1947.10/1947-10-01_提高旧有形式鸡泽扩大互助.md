　　Improving Old-Style Mutual Aid to Expand Cooperation in Jize
　　[Our Correspondents' Group, 29th] In Jize, a considerable number of mutual aid groups automatically formed by the masses in the old style have been discovered. Generally, there are three forms: first, jointly buying livestock and working together; second, jointly buying livestock and engaging in sideline occupations together; and third, jointly buying livestock and dividing the work. Their characteristics are small groups, few people, and no record of work points. They are mostly formed by close relatives, friends, or neighbors, and mostly occur among lower-middle peasants and poor peasants. The masses call them "sharing a plow," "pooling shares," or "bumping," which is an inherent low-level form of mutual aid among the masses, and is extremely common in Jize. In Old City Camp village, out of 180 households, 150 households are organized under this mutual aid. Out of 55 livestock in the entire village, 43 are organized, averaging over 80 percent. This kind of mutual aid is not promoted by any administrative force, but is based on the absolute willingness of the masses and develops from daily life to production mutual aid. It does not have precise recording or conversion of work points, but "a mute person eats dumplings, he knows how many he ate," no one can take advantage of anyone else, and no one suffers a loss. This spring, the government called for buying cattle. Old City Camp relied on this mutual aid, in the form of "sharing a plow," to increase from 24 livestock to 55, surpassing all other villages. This form of mutual aid has existed in the folk for a long time, but it has never developed as universally as it does today. The reporter and the leading comrades of Jize studied the reasons, and there are the following three points: (1) The new rural environment prompts the scattered peasants to gradually move towards collectivism. Peasants' participation in war, transporting grain, and carrying stretchers are collective activities. Participating in the militia and farmers' associations at home and living an organized life all make peasants increasingly experience the power of collective life. Ji Hongbin and other five households in Old City Camp were originally a substitute farming team, doing work for military families together. Over time, they understood each other and felt that the mutual aid method was good, so they automatically formed such a mutual aid group. (2) After the land reform, poor peasants were allocated land. They wanted to become rich, but there were not enough耕牛耕牛 for distribution, so the "sharing a plow" form of three to five families buying one ox together appeared. At first, they were not used to recording and calculating work, so they adopted the method of working in shifts. (3) Jize is the area most severely affected by the great famine of 1942, and it has not yet fully recovered. Generally, middle peasants also need "sharing a plow" shares. (4) Many villages in Jize need to rely on sideline occupations for subsidies. Sideline occupations often require collective efforts, and many have shifted from sideline mutual aid to agricultural mutual aid. According to the county party committee, although this is an old-style mutual aid, it is produced under new historical conditions and becomes a stage for transitioning to higher-level forms. Its advantage is voluntariness; its disadvantage is the lack of work point calculation. As long as the leadership pays attention to improvement, it will quickly become a high-level and consolidated mutual aid group. (Lin Li)
　　[Our Correspondent in Taiyue, 29th] After the overthrow struggle in Qiu Village, Wenxi, Southern Shanxi, labor production was organized. After the wheat harvest, Qiu Village organized more than 30 plows with all the livestock and all or half of the labor force in the village. More than 800 mu of wheat land in the village were divided equally among the groups for plowing. All the wheat land in the village has now been plowed three times. The masses reflected that "If we were not organized, 800 mu of land would take at least five days to plow. Now it only takes four days. It is good to be organized. Everyone works, and there is no wasteland in the village."

　　提高旧有形式鸡泽扩大互助
    【本报记者团廿九日电】鸡泽发现群众以旧有形式，自动组成的互助组，为数颇多。一般有三种形式：一是伙买牲口，伙做活。二是伙买牲口，伙闹副业。三是伙买牲口，分做活。其特点是组小人少不记工，多由知亲好友或邻居组成，又多产生在下中农和贫农之间，群众称之为“搁犋”“兑股”或“碰撞”，是一种群众中固有的低级互助形式，在鸡泽极为普遍。旧城营全村一百八十户，在这种互助下，组织起来一百五十户，全村五十五头牲畜中，组织起来四十三头，平均占百分之八十以上。这种互助，不经任何行政力量的督促，基于群众的绝对自愿，由日常生活发展到生产互助。它没有精细的记工折工，但“哑吧吃扁食，肚里有数”，谁也沾不了谁，谁也亏不了谁。今春政府号召买牛，旧城营依靠这种互助，以“搁犋”形式，由二十四头牲畜，增加到五十五头，超过了各村。这种互助形式，在民间存在已久，但从未象今天这样普遍的发展，记者同鸡泽领导同志研究原因有一下三点：（一）新的农村环境，促使着涣散的农民，逐渐走向集体。农民们参战、运粮、抬担架是集体活动，在家参加民兵、农会，过组织生活，都使农民日益体验到集体生活的力量。旧城营季洪斌等五户，原是一个代耕小组，一块给军属做活，日久天长，相互了解感到互助的方式好，乃自动组成一个这样的互助组。（二）土地改革后，贫苦农民都分到了土地，他们想发家致富，但耕牛不够分配，于是出现了三家至五家伙买一牛的“搁犋”形式，最初组织起来，对记工计工尚不习惯，于是采用了碰班做活的方式。（三）鸡泽是四二年大灾荒最严重的地区，至今尚未完全恢复元气。一般老中农，对“搁犋”股也很需要。（四）鸡泽不少村子，要依赖副业补助。副业多需集体闹，由副业互助！转向农业互助的也不少。据县委谈，这虽是一种旧式互助，但它产生在新的历史条件下，成为过渡到高级形式的一个阶段，它的好处，是自愿；缺点是没有计工。只要领导上注意提高，就会迅速的成为高级巩固的互助组。（林里）
    【本报太岳二十九日电】晋南闻喜邱村，经过翻身斗争后，组织起来劳动生产。邱村在麦收后，即把全村牲口和全半劳力组织了三十多犋犁，全村麦地八百余亩，平均分给各组进行犁地，全村麦地现已犁过三遍，群众反映说：“如果不组织起来，八百亩地至少五天才能犁完，现在四天就犁完了，组织起来就是好，人人劳动，全村没荒地”。
