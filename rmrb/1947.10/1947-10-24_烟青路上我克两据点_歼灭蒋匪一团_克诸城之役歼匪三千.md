Xinhua News Agency, Shandong Front, 22nd - A unit of the East China People's Liberation Army launched a surprise attack at dawn on the 15th on two strongholds, Sunshou (60 *li* southwest of Laiyang) and Dongxiagezhuang (80 *li* southwest of Laiyang), along the vital communication artery of the Yantai-Qingdao Highway. After fierce fighting lasting until the 16th, they completely annihilated the defending enemy, the 170th Regiment (missing two companies) of the 57th Brigade of Chiang's 74th Division (newly formed by merging the 2nd and 3rd Qingdao Garrison Brigades), and one battalion of the 17th Engineer Regiment. The local despots and "Home Returning Corps" in nearby villages were also captured. The strongholds of Sunshou and Dongxiagezhuang were also recovered by our forces. During the battle, the 171st Regiment of Chiang's 57th Brigade, under the cover of six aircraft, rushed to reinforce from Zekou, more than 100 *li* north of Jimo City. Their repeated fierce attacks were repelled by the People's Liberation Army, and a part of them was annihilated. The results of the battle are still being verified. Currently, the enemy in Laiyang City and Shuigoutou southwest of it are extremely panicked. The 54th Division of Chiang's army, which attempted to "suppress" the Laiyang-Haiyang area, had no choice but to flee back to the area west of the Yantai-Qingdao Highway, including Tianjingshan and Dianbu (both more than 90 *li* southwest of Laiyang) on the 10th, and their "suppression" scheme was thus foiled.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Shandong Front, 22nd - The Xu (Shiyou) Tan (Zhenlin) Headquarters issued a communique on the 19th on the victory of capturing Zhucheng, stating: A part of our East China People's Liberation Army, in coordination with the Weixian North Local Corps, began to encircle and attack Zhucheng on the evening of the 9th, and completely annihilated and captured all the defending enemies by the morning of the 15th. The total results were: 1. 562 enemy soldiers, including Liang Bingxin, battalion commander of the Transportation Battalion of Chiang's 64th Division, 156th Brigade, and his deputy battalion commander Pan Dinding, were captured alive. More than 140 enemies were killed or wounded. More than 2,450 members of the "Home Returning Corps" and others, including the puppet Zhucheng County Chief Nie Jinchen, were captured alive. 2. The following were seized: 5 mortars, 6 grenade launchers, 23 light and heavy machine guns, 676 rifles and pistols, and more than 75,000 rounds of ammunition.
