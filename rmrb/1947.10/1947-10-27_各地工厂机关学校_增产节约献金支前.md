    Factories, Government Offices, and Schools in Various Locations
    Increase Production, Practice Economy, Contribute Funds to Support the Front
    [Reported by our Newspaper] To support the great counter-offensive, military factories in the border regions have made many achievements in improving technology, increasing production, and saving materials. Comrade Li Guangting of the Second Branch of the First Military Factory modified a set of artillery shell large buckle threading machine, saving manpower by one and a half to two times. Comrade Liu Dianyuan modified a detonator eye-punching machine, increasing output by more than two times. Comrade Wang Jinyuan of the Third Branch of the First Factory researched and experimented to produce a flash box, saving sand casting, greatly increasing artillery shell production, and also saving the trouble of cleaning the furnace by turning the box every month, saving about two-thirds of the value compared to using iron boxes in the past, equivalent to 70,000 yuan. Comrades Wang Zhanyuan and Ye Housheng of the power plant, etc., researched and repaired the water leakage of the fire-tube boiler flower plate tube holes, so that the furnace did not have to be shut down. Comrades Wang Xirui, Tian Fuan, Wang Qishou, etc., of the military region's bomb institute, collectively researched and developed a firing machine. In the past, two people loaded and punched, producing about 3,000 pieces a day. Now using this punching machine, two people can produce 20,000 pieces a day, increasing efficiency by more than six times. Many factories have greatly increased production. For example, the number of people in the Second Factory increased by less than three-tenths compared to January, but the output exceeded more than double. Many factories automatically increased working hours; for example, the completion department of the Second Factory automatically changed to a ten-hour work system, and the carpentry department worked overtime every day except for Sundays and holidays. Workers of the First Factory automatically proposed to work overtime for half an hour every day, and some furnaces started operating before the work bell rang. In terms of savings: one group of the Eighth Factory saved 1,660 jin of crude saltpeter in one month, and also recovered 225 jin of nitric acid from waste acid; two groups saved more than 130 jin of caustic soda in one month by making degreased cotton, and three groups of the @ chemical shift saved 322 jin of Yi Tuo in one month, saving a total of more than 3.38 million yuan.

    [Reported by our Newspaper] The great victory news of our People's Liberation Army advancing into the Dabie Mountains reached Northern University. The whole school was excited. In addition to holding meetings to celebrate, sending telegrams to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Generals Liu and Deng, and paying tribute to the heroic commanders and fighters, each college conducted propaganda to the masses near the驻地, and launched a labor army movement in the school. According to preliminary statistics from the school headquarters and the four colleges of literature and education, finance and economics, medicine, and engineering (excluding the College of Art and the College of Agriculture), the labor army items totaled 400,3920 yuan in Hebei currency, plus soap, towels, shoes, consolation bags, clothes, bed sheets, scarves, stationery, paper, etc., with a minimum total value of 141,700 yuan.

    [Reported by our newspaper from Jincheng] Jincheng County government cadres economize on production to support the front. Except for formal notices and orders using white paper, the rest are replaced by waste paper. Lamp oil is three liang per lamp per month. In the past, each section had two pens and one ingot of ink per month, but from now on, all will be halved, and it is guaranteed not to affect work. According to statistics, a total of 14,900 yuan is saved per month in three items. In terms of personal savings, the original county magistrate, Secretary Liu, and others did not receive clothes until Chiang Kai-shek was overthrown; the general affairs section proposed: to open a mill and grind their own flour, and equip themselves with miscellaneous grains to adjust their lives. Cook Liu Xiaogui proposed: From now on, cooking should not exceed, waste, or eat raw food. Finally, the head of affairs also proposed: From now on, in affairs, we must achieve precise calculations, weigh rice and flour, and not waste a single bit of oil and salt, and calculate accounts once a month and issue a list. (Wang Yi)
    [Reported by our Newspaper] Encouraged by the news of the great counter-offensive, all personnel of the Xing City Yuxing Bank economized and donated money. Originally, each person had four jin of millet per day, but they automatically reduced it to three jin and twelve liang. The thirteen people in the bank saved a total of 368 jin of grain in three months, equivalent to more than 170,000 yuan in foreign currency according to the Xing City rice price. In addition to public support for the front, Comrade Zhan Kui volunteered to donate 10,000 yuan. Among the thirteen people, Huo Qingchun and Cao Jintang, among others, donated more than 10,000 yuan. Others donated 10,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, and so on, totaling 77,000 yuan in foreign currency. (Zhan Kui, Zhan Yuan)
    [Reported by our Newspaper] Workers from various departments of Dashing Company donated money to support the front. Yang Jichang, a worker from the second large group of the machine rolling department, said: "In order to defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible, we must respond to the call of the trade union!" Wang Yupuo specifically proposed to reduce wages by 20 percent, and the whole group unanimously agreed. The next morning, it was broadcast throughout the factory, and the workshops responded in unison. The first large group of the machine rolling department held an emergency meeting. First, Liu Chouzi said: "The Liu-Deng army has attacked the rear of the Chiang bandit, and the war consumption will be supplied by us." Li Maodan interjected: "Everyone should solve the difficulties together, everyone should shoulder the burden together, the front fights the war and the rear saves more, so that we can win." Twenty-three comrades once again dedicated their labor and money, and cadres also dedicated their clothing expenses and subsidies to the front until Chiang Kai-shek was defeated. Everyone unanimously passed: From September, reduce wages by 20% to support the counter-offensive front.
