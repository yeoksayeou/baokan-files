　　Huguan's Propaganda Counter-Offensive: The Masses are More Energetic in Harvesting and Planting
    [Report from our newspaper in Huguan] Various villages, while mobilizing for the autumn harvest and planting, combined this with publicizing the victory news of the great counter-offensive, inspiring the morale of the masses. For example, when mobilizing for the autumn harvest and planting in Suizhuang, after reporting the news of the People's Liberation Army's major counter-offensive, Wu Jinchang excitedly said: "The army is winning battles at the front, and we must also win a victory in the rear. Men and women, young and old, should organize and make a concentrated effort on the autumn harvest and planting, and give priority to helping the military families with their land." Wu Tianfu said: "I guarantee to do a good job in one group and complete the autumn harvest and planting ahead of schedule." Zhou Libao, a military family member from E'wu, also proposed: "Winning the autumn harvest this year is a double blessing. We must hurry up with the harvest and planting, and not let the wind blow away the grain or the ground freeze." Militia member Li Hushan also said: "Let's finish the harvest and planting quickly and give Jiang Thief a good thrashing. I have already prepared my shoes, and I know that four or five other militiamen are also ready. They have even sewn bags." The masses in Jidian proposed: "Only with victories at both the front and the rear can we have good times." Cheng Chengbao, chairman of the Farmers' Association, has prepared dry rations and asked his wife to make shoes. After a concentrated effort on the autumn harvest and planting, he will definitely go to participate in the war to uproot the old roots. In this way, inspired by the victory news, a revolutionary competition was launched between teams. The whole village started harvesting on the afternoon of the 7th. There were 104.5 male laborers and 185 female laborers. In three and a half days, all 1,119.7 mu of grain in the village were cut down, completing the five-day plan in three and a half days. Now, with the full force of men, women, and auxiliary laborers, under the slogan of "making a final决斗 with the wind disaster," 337 villages completed the harvesting of all 135,956 mu of millet in five days, achieving fast and good harvesting.

　　壶关宣传大反攻　群众收种更带劲
    【本报壶关讯】各村在动员秋收秋耕时结合着宣传大反攻胜利消息，鼓舞群众情绪，如睢庄动员秋收秋耕时，先将人民解放军大举反攻消息报告后，吴进昌即兴奋着说：“军队在前方打胜仗，咱们在后方也打个胜仗，男女老少组织起来，突击秋收秋耕，并先给军属把地做好。”吴天富说：“我保证搞好一个组，提前完成秋收秋耕。”鹅屋军属周李保也提出：“今年秋收打胜仗是双喜进门，咱们赶快收耕；不要叫风刮了谷，地上了冻。”民兵李虎山也说：咱们快收耕完，给蒋贼干一下，我已准备好鞋了，我还知道有四、五个民兵也准备好了，还缝上了袋子，集店群众提出：“只有前后方两胜利，才能过好时光。”农会主席程成保，已准备好干粮，并叫他媳妇做好鞋，突击秋收秋耕后，一定去参战刨老根。这样，在胜利消息鼓舞下，展开了队与队的革命竞赛，全村于七日下午开镰，男劳力一百零四个半，女劳力一百八十五个，三天半即将全村一千一百一十九亩七分谷全部割倒，五天计划三天半完成。现在在男女全半辅全力突击，与“向风灾作最后决斗”的口号下，三百三十七村，在五日内即将十三万五千九百五十六亩谷子全部割完，作到了收的快，收的好。（良弼、德富）
