　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Reuters reported on the 20th, citing the Shanghai Continental News, that the Chiang government is about to issue new banknotes with a face value of 50,000 yuan. The newspaper estimates that the new banknotes may be issued within the week. In addition, according to a United Press report from Shanghai on the 13th, the Chiang government had already printed large denomination customs gold units (equivalent to 50,000 legal tender) of 2,500 yuan, which will be issued in late December. Since the beginning of this year, Chiang Kai-shek bandits have desperately issued new banknotes. According to a study by Chinese statisticians and experts cited in an article in the May issue of the *Millard's Review* entitled "Chinese Hyperinflation," the total amount of banknotes, including those with denominations of 5,000, 2,500, 2,000, 10,000, and customs gold units of 250 and 500, reached more than 23 trillion yuan. In addition, economist Zhang Naiqi estimated that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government issued 100 billion to 150 billion yuan in paper money every day.
