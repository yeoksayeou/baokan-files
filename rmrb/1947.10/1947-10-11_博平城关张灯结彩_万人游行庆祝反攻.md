(This dispatch from Ji-Lu-Yu on the 9th of this month) Bo Ping City Gate is festooned with lanterns and decorations: Ten thousand people parade to celebrate the counter-offensive. The news of the victorious arrival of Liu Deng's counter-offensive army in the Central Plains immediately caused a sensation in the entire city of Bo Ping. Staff from government offices and schools ran around telling each other about the news in the papers, while merchants and the masses were even more overjoyed. Slogans such as "Celebrate the Counter-Offensive and Welcome Victory," "Liu Deng's Army Enters the Central Plains," and "Celebrate Victory, All Goods Reduced in Price" were brewing everywhere and plastered all over the city. All store entrances were hung with colorful lanterns. In the evening, more than ten thousand people in the Chengguan district held a rally to celebrate the victory and counter-offensive. When Minister Sun of the County Committee Propaganda Department explained the overall war situation, the audience applauded like thunder and cheered deafeningly. Representatives from workers, farmers, youth, and women also spoke one after another, all filled with confidence in the victory of the army's counter-offensive. Immediately afterwards, a lantern parade began. There were old men in their sixties and seventies, toddlers who could barely run, young men and women, all writing "Celebrate the Counter-Offensive" on various colorful lanterns. The sound of gongs and drums filled the air, and the masses in the city celebrated wildly. After the parade returned to the venue, the amateur drama club performed the play "Nanjing Seeks Reinforcements," which lasted until 12 o'clock before it ended.
