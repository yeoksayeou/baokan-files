Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Comprehensive reports: The Labor Party cabinet, which is intensifying the exploitation of labor to salvage the economic crisis, has recently been met with counterattacks from trade unions. At a cabinet meeting on the 25th, Fuel Minister Shinwell announced that negotiations between the National Coal Board and the miners' union regarding increased work had failed. Although 60,000 miners in Yorkshire have resumed work, they refuse to increase their workload, and a new wave of miners' strikes is spreading. According to an Associated Press report, the week-long strike in the Scottish mining area had expanded to three mines on the 25th, with 13,000 strikers. In addition, the Labor Party authorities' economic policies have also been condemned within the British Trade Union Congress (Trades Union Congress), the Labor Party's political foundation. On the 27th, the Trades Union Congress passed a resolution proposed by the Amalgamated Engineering Union, denouncing the government for asking workers to endure hardships while allowing factory owners to increase profits. Amalgamated Engineering Union representative Haikin stated at the meeting: "Every statement issued by a responsible minister indicates that the poor must pay, while the rich are not harmed." Haikin pointed out that the way to break the shackles of dollar imperialism is to use national planning to implement social service plans, raise living standards, and modernize basic industries. Haikin finally demanded that the government reduce the army by 500,000 troops, sign longer-term trade agreements with the Soviet Union and other European democratic countries and autonomous territories of the empire, and reduce the income of the wealthy through capital taxes and control of profits and prices. On the 22nd, the Executive Committee of the British Association of Building Technicians also passed a resolution opposing the government's decision to halt new construction projects (which aims to transfer 250,000 construction workers to other industries) and demanding a reduction of the army by 500,000.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: London dispatch: The British economic crisis continues to develop. According to a Reuters report on the 19th, British exports in August were valued at 374.44 million US dollars, 66.8 million US dollars less than in July, and 129.6 million US dollars lower than the monthly export target announced by Cripps on the 12th. At the same time, imports in August were 696 million US dollars, 20.08 million US dollars less than the import figure for July. However, in terms of the amount of excess imports, August increased by 48.4 million US dollars compared to July. Due to the freezing of the last 400 million US dollars of the American loan, the British Treasury announced on the 14th that, in order to pay for its excess imports, it had sold a portion of its last gold reserves (totaling 2.4 billion US dollars), which were stored to prevent economic collapse, to the United States in exchange for 80 million US dollars in foreign exchange. This move shocked the British press. The Daily Telegraph stated: "The gold reserve represents Britain's last line of defense, and the general surprise is that the sale began so quickly." The Daily Express stated: "The decision to sell gold shows the seriousness of Britain's financial and economic situation."

  　总工会斥责政府反动经济政策
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】综合报导：加强榨取劳工以挽救经济危机的工党内阁，最近连遭工会方面的反击。二十五日内阁会议上，燃料大臣辛威尔宣布，国家煤矿局与矿工工会间关于增加工作的谈判，已告失败。约克郡六万矿工虽已复工，但拒绝增加工作，而新的矿工工潮又在蔓延。据美联社电称，持续一周的斯各兰矿区的罢工，二十五日已扩大至三个矿坑，罢工者达一万三千人。另外工党当局的经济政策，在工党的政治基础英国总工会（职工大会）内亦受到谴责。总工会于廿七日通过混合工程工会所提之决议，斥责政府要工人忍耐负重而听任厂主增加利润。混合工程工会代表海金在会上称：“每一负责大臣所发表的声明，都表示穷人必须偿付，而富人则不受损伤。”海金指出：击破美元帝国主义钳制的方法，是利用国家计划实现社会服务计划，提高生活水准，将基本工业现代化。海金最后要求政府减少五十万军队，与苏联及欧洲其他各民主国和帝国各自治领签订较长期的贸易协定，并以资本税及管制利润与物价的方法，减少富豪的收入。二十二日英建筑技师工会执委会亦通过决议，反对政府停止新建筑计划的决定（按该决定企图以二十五万建筑工人转入其他工业）而要求裁减军队五十万。
    【新华社陕北廿一日电】伦敦讯：英国经济危机继续发展中。据路透社十九日电称：英国八月份出口值三亿七千四百四十万美元，比七月份少六千六百八十万元，比克利浦斯十二日所宣布的出口计划每月出口目标低一亿二千九百六十万元。同时，八月份入口为六亿九千六百万元，比较七月份之入口数字少两千零八十万元。但在货物入超的数额上，八月份则较七月份增加四千八百四十万元。由于美国贷款最后四亿元的被冻结，英国为支付其入超，财政部十四日宣布，已将其所存以防经济崩溃的最后黄金储备（总值二十四亿美元）的一部分售予美国，换取八千万元的美元外汇。此举曾引起英伦报界的震惊，每日电讯报称：“黄金储备代表英国的最后防线，一般的惊异是出售的开始竟这么快。”每日快报称：“出售黄金的决定，显示英国财政与经济形势的严重”。
