　　[Reported from Taiyue on the 21st] The Taiyue and Lüliang local military corps jointly defeated Yan's bandit troops harassing Xiangling, eliminating over 800 of them and recapturing Xiangling city. Jiang's bandit 30th Division, besieged in Linfen, instigated Yan's bandits to harass Fenxi in early October, attempting to open a land escape route. They reorganized the remnants of the county exile governments, security police, police stations, the 5th Security Regiment, and the 15th Security Regiment, which had gathered in Linfen, into seven detachments. On the 8th, they occupied Xiangling city and then harassed villages south of the city such as Gucheng, Xindian, and Fuchou (over 20 li south of the city). The Taiyue local military corps and the Lüliang ×× sub-district local armed forces counterattacked Yan's bandits on the 15th, completely eliminating one of Yan's bandit detachments and part of the sixth detachment in Fuchou that evening. The bandits in Xiangling abandoned the city and fled in panic on the evening of the 16th upon hearing the news. Our army pursued and annihilated them, encircling them on the 17th. By 12:00 on the 18th, we had completely annihilated the 3rd, 2nd detachments and the entire 2nd battalion of the 5th detachment. The bandits who had ventured out only had a remnant of the 5th detachment which fled in a panic to Ludao Village (10 li northwest of Linfen), attempting to cross the Fen River eastward and flee back to Linfen. As their boats reached the middle of the river, they were suddenly intercepted by Yan's bandit 15th Security Regiment, which was guarding the east bank of the river in a state of panic, capsizing two boats and drowning over 100 bandits. In four days of fighting, our army completely annihilated Jiang and Yan's bandit 1st, 2nd, and 3rd detachments and the entire 2nd battalion of the 5th detachment, and part of the 6th detachment, killing and wounding over 160 bandits, including Deputy Commander and 1st Detachment Leader Diao Peilin. We captured over 720 bandits, including deputy detachment leaders, seized 25 light machine guns, two small cannons, two grenade launchers, one submachine gun, 14 pistols, over 660 rifles, and over 4,000 rounds of ammunition.

　　[Reported from Taihang on the 19th] The YU (ci) Tai (gu) Qi (county) Western Guerrilla Team, active west of the Tongpu Railway, has repeatedly achieved victories within the grid network dotted with Yan's bandit strongholds. On the night of September 6th, the team used the tactic of attacking from within to break through the enemy's blockade and lay an ambush near the Shang'erying Village stronghold, about 40 li southeast of Taiyuan and 15 li west of Yuji city. The next day, as soon as the sun rose, they launched a surprise action and captured all eleven Yan's bandits in the stronghold alive without firing a shot, and returned safely. They also seized two small cannons, nine rifles, over 30 shells, over 70 grenades, and over 200 rounds of ammunition. On the evening of the 22nd of this month, they secretly concealed themselves in the Bait Village Temple, 10 li north of Taigu city. On the morning of the 23rd, 24 members of Yan's bandit self-defense force from Shuixiu Township entered the village, and the guerrilla team quickly surrounded the village, compressing the enemy into a courtyard. The battle lasted ten minutes, and the enemy was eliminated. A total of three were killed and sixteen were captured. One light machine gun, one small cannon, eleven rifles, one submachine gun, and over 500 rounds of ammunition were seized. We suffered no casualties.
