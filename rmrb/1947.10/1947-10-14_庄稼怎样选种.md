    Why Select Seeds?
    As the saying goes, "A strong mother makes a fat foal." This is true for livestock, and it's also true for crops. Good seeds are essential for growing good crops. In a field of crops, there are distinctions between good and bad plants, and within a single plant, there are distinctions between good and bad seeds. Therefore, seeds should be improved through selection, and planting with carefully selected seeds year after year will certainly lead to better crops. For example, if there are two fields of rice with the same soil quality, the same amount of fertilizer, and the same level of cultivation and management, but the seeds used are different, the yield of one field might be higher, or the quality of the grain might be better. This is due to the seeds; some seeds can produce more grain, while others can produce better grain, and some can produce both more and better grain. The purpose of seed selection is to select seeds with high yield and high quality, capable of producing more and better grain.
    Seed selection can also reduce pests and diseases. Generally, crops in the field suffer from pests and diseases every year, but some are affected lightly, some severely, and some suffer no loss at all. This is also related to the seeds. Some seeds have natural resistance to pests, and this resistance varies in strength. For example, "bitter root millet is not afraid of walnut root worms," and "Xiao Chong Chou millet" can prevent sparrows from eating the ears. In our region, the loss from pests each year is at least 10 to 15 percent of the total harvest. Therefore, we must vigorously encourage and organize the masses to select seeds in the fields. Every comrade working in rural areas should pay attention to this task, and, through labor heroes, model workers, mutual aid teams, and the organization of technical committees, thoroughly study and implement this seed selection method among the masses.
      What Conditions Should Be Considered When Selecting Seeds?
    In addition to paying attention to high yield and high quality, it is important to consider the local climate and soil conditions. When selecting seeds, it is essential to investigate these conditions. For example, seeds from Henan, even if they are good, might not grow well in Shanxi due to differences in climate and soil. Generally, seeds can be mutually selected between places with similar climate and soil conditions. Seeds from colder regions can usually be planted in warmer regions without much problem. However, if you reverse this and plant seeds from warmer regions in colder regions, they might not grow well.
    Second, pay attention to the maturity period. Seed selection should be carried out in the field when the majority of the crops are ripe. Select the earliest maturing crops, as they occupy the land for a shorter period and make it easier to plant two crops in a season. Do not wait until all the crops are ripe to select seeds, as it will then be difficult to distinguish between early and late maturing ones.
    Third, pay attention to the purity of the variety. For the convenience of cultivation, management, and harvesting, the crops in the field must be uniform. For example, when selecting "Chai Gan Lai Wu Xian millet," do not mix it with "Bai Gan Lai Wu Xian millet." Therefore, seed selection must be done in the field.
    Fourth, pay attention to plumpness and strong germination ability. Small and light seeds should definitely be avoided, and excessively large seeds should also not be selected. Choose relatively large seeds from the common seeds, with the main purpose of ensuring plumpness. The largest seeds are not necessarily the best. For example, planting a large pumpkin seed does not guarantee that it will produce a large pumpkin.
    Fifth, pay attention to bright color. Do not select seeds that have been soaked in water, are diseased, infested with insects, are not fully mature, or have dull outer skins.
    Sixth, pay attention to strong resistance. Good varieties should be able to withstand drought, not rot in continuous rain, not fall over in strong winds, and not be damaged by spring frost. In our region, special attention should be paid to selecting drought-resistant varieties. This aspect also requires seed selection in the field.
    Seventh, pay attention to the absence of pests and diseases. This not only requires attention to the seeds themselves, but also requires inspecting the entire plant. Any plant with insects or diseases on its roots, stems, leaves, or ears should not be selected for seed.
      How to Identify Good Seeds
    1. Millet. The seeds should be of moderate size, deep yellow in color, with thin husks, thick and large ears, tightly packed spikelets, long awns, erect stalks, drooping ears, and free from diseases such as "Kang Gu Lao" (chaffy grain), "Wu Mei" (black mold), and "Fan Qing" (re-greening).

　　庄稼怎样选种
    马琳
    （农业知识）
    为什么要选种
    俗语说：“母壮驹肥”，牲畜是这样，庄稼也是如此。种籽好才能长好庄稼。一块地里的庄稼有好坏的分别，一颗庄稼上的籽粒也有好坏的分别。所以种籽是愈选愈好，年年用选好的种籽种地，庄稼就一定一年比一年好。比如有两块谷地，土地一样上粪一般多，耕种管理的工夫也一般多，只是种的种籽不一样，到了收获的时候，也许这块地比那块多打粮食，也许这块地比那块地的粮食成色好一些，这就是种籽的问题，有的种籽能多打粮有的种籽能打好粮食，更有些种籽能打又多又好的粮食。选种的目的就是要选出产量大品质高的种籽，能多打好粮食。
    选种还可以减少病虫害。一般地里的庄稼那一年也生虫生病的，但有的轻有的重有的就完全不损失，这也与种籽有关系，原来有些种籽对受虫害有天然的抵抗力，这种抵抗力有的强有的弱，“苦根谷不怕核桃虫咬根”，“小虫愁谷”能防麻雀吃穗。我区的庄稼每年受虫害的损失至少要有总收获量的百分之十到十五。因此我们要大力号召与组织群众到地里选种。在农村工作每个同志重视这件工作，通过劳动英雄模范、互助队、组织技术委员会把这个选种办法加以很好的研究贯澈到群众中去。
      选种应注意些什么条件
    除注意产量大品质高以外，要注意适合当地风土。在选种的时候必须调查风土。比如河南的种籽拿到山西来种，虽然是好种，但因气候土质不同不一定就能长好庄稼。一般的说两个地方风土差不多籽才能互助选种。寒地种，种到比较暖的地方还没有什么妨碍。要是倒过来，把暖地种到较寒地区就有长不好的可能。
    二、要注意成熟期，在庄稼成熟一多半的时候就到地里进行选种。选成熟最早的，成熟期早的庄稼，占地的日期短，容易赶种两季。不要等全部成熟再选种，因为全成熟了以后，就分不出早晚了。
    三、要注意种类纯粹。为了耕种管理收获便利，地里种的庄稼必须一律。比如选“柴杆来五县谷”就不能搀混“白杆来五县谷”。这样选种就非到地进行不可。
    四、要注意饱实，发芽力强。小的轻的籽粒当然不要，特别大的也不要选。要从普通的种实里选比较大的，主要目的是要求饱实，最大的不一定是好种。比如选出一个大南瓜种籽种上不一定能结大南瓜。
    五、要注意色泽鲜明。受水泡、长病、生虫、没成熟、外皮全没有光彩的都不要选。
    六、要注意抵抗力强。旱天干不死，连阴雨不烂叶，刮大风不倒苗，春寒冻不坏，这才是好品种。在我区来说要特别注意选抗旱力。要注意这方面也得到地里选种。
    七、要注意没病虫害。这不单单注意种籽，还要检查全棵，不论是根茎叶穗那一处生虫有病全不要选做种。
      如何识别好种籽
    一、谷。籽粒大小适中，颜色深黄，糠皮薄，穗粗大，马子（小穗）紧密，刚毛长，杆直立，穗头下垂，没有“糠谷老”“乌霉”“返青”等病。
