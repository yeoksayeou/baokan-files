　　Finished in Eight Days This Year, Compared to a Month in Previous Years
　　Men and Women in Tu Po Village Compete in Plowing on the Slope

　　[This newspaper's Ping Shun dispatch] In order to avoid the ground freezing, Tu Po Village in the Fifth District launched a crash autumn plowing campaign. At a mass meeting of the whole village on the evening of the fourth day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar, model group leader Liu Huze and others proposed: "If we want to complete the autumn plowing ahead of schedule, we must organize people to pull plows. This way, we can complete it all by the twelfth day." Spinning heroine Duan Gaiying proposed: "This year during the autumn harvest, our women challenged the men and did no less work than them. We will challenge the men again during the autumn plowing (pulling plows)!" Their speeches influenced men and women, young and old, throughout the village. Groups and individuals, men and women, challenged each other to compete. They began the next day. Statistics from just one day showed that sixteen livestock plowed thirty-six and a half mu of land, men pulling plows plowed eight mu with twelve people, and women pulling plows plowed twelve mu with eighteen people. The women surpassed the men. Each group had seven people, six pulling the plow and one managing the plow. The women also managed the plows themselves, without men. Through this crash campaign, a total of 499 mu of land were plowed: 340 mu were plowed once, and 159 mu were plowed twice. In addition, 47.5 mu of wheat were harvested during the autumn plowing. Model deeds were praised and broadcast in a timely manner during the crash campaign, and many models emerged. In particular, Cao Shuangxi, a sixty-year-old man, Duan Qiuxiang, a fifteen-year-old girl, and Niu Xinkai, a thirty-seven-year-old elderly woman, pulled plows just like able-bodied workers. Military dependents Guo Fengze and Yang Kaisong also played a model role in this. The entire village, except for 50 mu of cotton land and 10 mu of hemp land, was completely plowed. What used to take a month in previous years was finished in eight days this year. (Wang Bao)
