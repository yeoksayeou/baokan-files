Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. The People's Liberation Army Headquarters spokesman today spoke to reporters about the Jiaodong war situation, pointing out that our army has already turned to the counter-offensive on this battlefield, and predicted that the People's Liberation Army will annihilate more enemies in the future than in the past. The spokesman said that since our three armies of Liu Deng, Chen Su, and Chen Xie marched to the area between the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to draw a large number of troops from the Shandong battlefield to deal with the situation in a hurry, which changed the situation in Shandong. However, Chiang Kai-shek still has six divisions in Jiaodong, and still wants to maintain his desperate offensive. Since the beginning of September, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army, under the command of Fan Hanjie, advanced side by side from the line of Changyi, Gaomi, and Jiaoxian with the 8th Division, 9th Division, 25th Division, and 54th Division, invading our Jiaodong; the 45th Division and 64th Division were responsible for the defense of Changyi, Gaomi, Jiaoxian, Zhucheng and other areas. The above forces totaled six divisions and eighteen brigades, all of which belonged to Chiang bandits' elite. The bandit army's 28th Division, 83rd Division, 44th Division, and 12th Division, which were responsible for the defense in the area south of Yishui and Juxian and west of Zi (chuan) Bo (shan), are not within the scope of Jiaodong. Chiang bandits' attempt was to occupy the key points of our Jiaodong, cut off the connection between Northeast China and Shandong and North China, which was said to be able to control our army's lifeline. American imperialism placed great hope on this action of the Chiang bandits and gave it practical assistance. An Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on September 27 said: The US Navy and Marine Corps held an amphibious landing exercise in Qingdao on September 24, "with a 'considerable' number of landing ships participating." "Qingdao is crowded with all kinds of ships." The Associated Press said that this exercise was only a week away from the landing of Chiang bandits' navy in Yantai on American-made warships. The purpose was to embolden Chiang bandits and complete the invasion mission. Under the combined offensive of Chiang and the United States, our Shandong People's Liberation Army carried out skillful operations. On September 18 and 19, our powerful Jiaodong troops annihilated parts of the 8th and 9th Divisions of Chiang bandits at Daotou Town, southwest of Zhaoyuan, totaling more than 3,000, and then took advantage of the victory to turn from east to west into the enemy's rear, meeting another powerful troop. This heroic action changed the Jiaodong war situation. On September 24, Chiang bandit's 9th Division retreated from Zhaoyuan to Pingdu due to the threat to its rear. From September 26 to 28, it was blocked by us in the Dazeshan area at the junction of Pingdu, Yexian, Zhaoyuan, and Laiyang counties, and more than 2,000 were annihilated. Then, in the area between Pingdu, Yexian, Changyi, and Gaomi counties, that is, the Jiahe River Basin, it met with another powerful troop that crossed the Jiaoji Railway to the north from the area south of the Jiaoji Railway, and launched fierce battles with the bandit army in this area. On the 3rd of this month, our army surrounded the main force of the bandit 64th Division in Fanjiaji, west of Pingdu, and fought with the four bandit armies that came to rescue in the outer area of Fanji. Chiang bandits were completely passive. From the 3rd to the 9th, the bandit army that was forced to mobilize and fight with our army included two main brigades of the 64th Division, another brigade of the division that came to reinforce from the south of the Jiaoji Railway, the entire 9th Division, and the 211th Brigade and 212th Brigade of the 45th Division. In six days and nights of fierce fighting, our army defeated the bandit army. In addition to those who were defeated, we annihilated four regiments of the main force of the 64th Division, the entire 211th Brigade of the 45th Division, and two battalions of the 9th Division, totaling more than 12,000 enemies. Among them, more than 8,000 were captured alive, including Zhang Zhongzhong, the brigade commander of the 211th Brigade. At the same time, our army recovered Yexian, Changyi, and Qixia. Yexian was captured by our army, annihilating the 5th Regiment (missing one battalion) of the Independent Brigade of the 8th Division, the transport battalion of the 42nd Brigade of the division, and the Yexian Brigade and the "Homecoming Corps." The bandit army in Changyi and Qixia counties, shocked by our victory in the Jiahe River, abandoned the city and fled south.

After the victory of the Jiahe River, only two of the four divisions of Chiang bandits who penetrated into the Jiaodong Peninsula, namely the 25th Division and the 54th Division, remained in strongholds such as Laiyang, Longkou, Fushan, Penglai, and Yantai. The 9th Division had already fled south, and the 8th Division has now fled south to cooperate with the remnants of the 64th and 45th Divisions to maintain the Jiaoji Line. The entire military situation of the Chiang bandits in Jiaodong is extremely dangerous, and they are bound to repeat the mistakes of the Chiang bandits in northern Shaanxi.

The spokesman pointed out: After the People's Liberation Army launched a large-scale counter-offensive in August and September, Chiang Kai-shek had only a local Jiaodong offensive left. Chiang Kai-shek was still dreaming, hoping to succeed in Jiaodong and transfer some of the Jiaodong Chiang army to other battlefields to reverse the decline. In particular, Chen Cheng hoped that Chiang Kai-shek would give him a few divisions to save his life. This dream has now been shattered. Chiang Kai-shek and his master, the Americans, measured the People's Liberation Army with their own standards, believing that it would be impossible to fight if the rear was cut off; believing that our army in Shandong and even North China was supplied by the Northeast. Indeed, the People's Liberation Army does need a steady stream of supplies every month and every day. Without supplies, it cannot fight. On this point, Chiang Kai-shek and the Americans are not wrong. However, they guessed the direction of the supply wrong. The People's Liberation Army's supply does not come from any other direction, but from Washington and Nanjing. The senior officials responsible for transportation are none other than Truman and Chiang Kai-shek. People can confirm from the next few months that after Chiang Kai-shek occupied Longkou and Yantai, the People's Liberation Army on all fronts in Shandong and the whole country will annihilate more Chiang bandit troops than before. If, in the past fifteen months, an average of eight brigades of Chiang's troops were annihilated each month, then this will greatly increase in the future. This is because the People's Liberation Army has adopted the correct strategic policy, launched a large-scale counter-offensive, and attacked Chiang Kai-shek's rear, thus dispersing Chiang's army, putting Chiang's army in a passive position, being beaten everywhere, coping everywhere, and unable to avoid the fate of being annihilated in larger quantities than in the past.

The spokesman said: The advantages and disadvantages of cutting off the Jiaodong transportation line are actually the opposite of what Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang imagined. From a certain point of view, cutting off is beneficial to the People's Liberation Army and disadvantageous to the Chiang bandits. This is because Chiang bandits foolishly dispersed their little army that was already insufficient. On our side, the temporary abandonment of some strongholds in Jiaodong restrained 18 brigades of Chiang bandits, making it impossible for them to be used elsewhere. On the Chiang bandits' side, not only that, but they will also lose these six divisions, because they are also dispersed in Jiaodong, and they will be annihilated one by one in Jiaodong, just like in northern Shaanxi. Thanks to Chiang Kai-shek, the deeper his army goes, the easier it is to be annihilated. In northern Shaanxi, 11 brigades of Chiang's army have been annihilated and suffered annihilation blows in seven months, making Hu Zongnan crestfallen, and the ghost of total annihilation follows him every day. The annihilation battle in Jiaodong has already begun this month, and its obvious effect and great test will be in the future.

　　总部发言人纵谈战局
  　胶东我军转入反攻
    各线大军将更大量歼灭蒋匪
    【新华社陕北十五日电】人民解放军总部发言人今日向记者谈胶东战局，指出在这个战场上我军已经转入反攻，并预言人民解放军将在今后较之过去时期更要大量的歼灭敌人。发言人说，自我刘邓、陈粟、陈谢三路大军打到黄河长江之间以后，蒋介石被迫从山东战场抽了大批军队仓卒应付，使山东局势起了变化。但蒋介石在胶东方面尚有六个师，尚欲维持其绝望的攻势。九月初旬起，蒋介石匪军在范汉杰指挥下，以第八师、第九师、第二十五师、第五十四师，由昌邑、高密、胶县之线齐头并进，犯我胶东；以四十五师及六十四师任昌邑、高密、胶县、诸城一带的守备。以上兵力共计六个师十八个旅，均属蒋匪精锐。在沂水、莒县一带以南、淄（川）博（山）以西任守备之匪军第二十八师、第八十三师、第四十四师、第十二师等部，不在胶东范围之内。蒋匪企图是占领我胶东要点，切断东北与山东及华北的联系，据说是可以制我军的死命。美国帝国主义对于蒋匪这一行动，寄以极大希望，并给以实际协助。美联社上海九月二十七日电讯说：美国海军及陆战队曾于九月二十四日在青岛举行两栖登陆战演习，“参加者有‘可观’数量的登陆舰”。“青岛挤满了各种船只”。美联社所说的这种演习，距乘着美造军舰的蒋匪海军登陆烟台不过一星期，其目的是给蒋匪壮胆，完成侵占任务。在蒋美配合进攻下，我山东人民解放军进行了巧妙的作战。九月十八、十九两日，我胶东有力兵团在招远西南之道头镇歼灭蒋匪第八、第九两师各一部，共三千余以后，乘胜由东向西转入敌人后方，会合另一有力兵团，这一英勇行动转变了胶东战局。九月二十四日，蒋匪第九师因其后方受到威胁，由招远向平度回窜，二十六日至二十八日，被我阻击于平度，掖县、招远、莱阳四县交界之大泽山地区，歼其二千余。接着即在平度、掖县、昌邑、高密四县中间地区，即胶河流域，与由胶济路以南地区，越过胶济路向北之另一有力兵团会合，并在该地区与匪军展开了激战。本月三日，我军在平度以西之范家集，包围匪六十四师主力，并在范集外围地区与赶来救援的四路匪军作战，蒋匪完全处于被动。从三日至九日，被迫调动与我军作战者，计有六十四师主力两个旅，及从胶济路南赶来增援之该师另一旅，第九师全部，四十五师之二一一旅及二一二旅。我军在六昼夜激战中，将匪军击败，除被击溃者外，被我歼灭者有六十四师主力四个团，四十五师二一一旅全部，第九师两个营，共计歼敌一万二千余。其中被我活捉者，有二一一旅旅长张中忠以下八千余。在同一时间，我军收复掖县、昌邑、栖霞三城。掖县为我攻占，歼敌第八师独立旅第五团（缺一个营）、该师四十二旅之输送营，及掖县大队与“还乡团”。昌邑、栖霞两县匪军则因受我胶河胜利所震撼，弃城南窜。
    胶河胜利后，蒋匪深入胶东半岛之四个师，仅有两个师，即第二十五师第五十四师留在莱阳、龙口、福山、蓬莱、烟台等据点，第九师早已南窜，第八师现已南窜协同第六十四、第四十五两师残部维持胶济线。蒋匪在胶东之整个军事形势极为危险，势将重踏蒋匪在陕北之覆辙。
    发言人指出：八九两月人民解放军开始了大举反攻之后，蒋介石手里只剩下一个地方性的胶东攻势，蒋介石还在做梦，希望在胶东得手后，把胶东蒋军调出几部到其他战场挽回颓势。特别是陈诚希望蒋介石给他几个师救命，这个梦现在业已幻灭。蒋介石和他的主子美国人拿了自己的尺度测量人民解放军，认为断了后方接济即不能作战；认为山东甚至华北我军，是受东北方面接济的。真的，人民解放军确需要每月每日源源不断的接济，无接济则不能作战，在这点上，蒋介石及美国人并没有猜错。可是，接济的方向他们猜错了，人民解放军的接济不是从任何别的方向来的，而是从华盛顿和南京来的，负责运送的大员不是别人，就是杜鲁门和蒋介石。人们可以从今后数月中得到证实，即是从蒋介石占了龙口、烟台之后，山东及全国各线人民解放军将要较之以前更多地歼灭蒋匪军。如果说过去十五个月中，平均每月歼灭蒋军八个旅，则今后必将大为增加。这是因为人民解放军采取了正确的战略方针，大举反攻，打到蒋介石后方去，因而分散了蒋军，使蒋军处于被动地位，处处挨打，处处应付，无法避免较之过去更大量地被歼的命运。
    发言人说：对于切断胶东交通线的利害，实际上和蒋介石匪帮所设想的相反，从某一点上说来，切断对于人民解放军有利，对于蒋匪不利，这是因为蒋匪将自己早已不够用的一点军队愚蠢地分散了。在我们方面，以胶东若干据点的暂时放弃，钳制了蒋匪十八个旅，使其无法用于别处。在蒋匪方面，则不但如此，且将送掉这六个师，因其在胶东也是分散的，势将各个被歼灭在胶东，正如在陕北一样。要谢谢蒋介石，他的军队愈深入就愈易被歼，陕北蒋军在七个月内被歼灭及受歼灭性打击者已达十一个旅，打得胡宗南垂头丧气，全军覆灭的幽灵天天跟着他。胶东方面的歼灭战本月业已开始，其明效大验还在将来。
