A Correspondence from the Border Region of Hebei, Shandong, Henan: A Disaster Brought by the Chiang Bandit
    Wen Yuan

[Our correspondent from the border region of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, 23rd] The day after the Mid-Autumn Festival, I moved with the army to Xiewan Village in Kaocheng. The old couple who owned the house were extremely warm and friendly to us. That night, they were already outside binding sorghum stalks under the moonlight. I went up to them, and as soon as we started talking, they began pouring out their grievances. The old man was called Xie Tongling. When the family divided the property years ago, he only got two mu of land. He worked as a tenant farmer for the landlord his whole life, but in his old age, he only ended up with a consumptive cough. In the past few years, he couldn't even farm much land anymore, so he tried to sell fried dough balls, carry a sesame seed cake basket, collect manure, and dry salt. He tried everything he could think of, but in the end, he still had to beg for food for several years.

The old man had three sons and two daughters. The second son died when he was only two or three years old. Two years ago, the eldest son, Jinshu, joined the Kaocheng County militia. He received preferential treatment from the government and received a sack of grain and a sack of sorghum, which improved their lives a little. But since the summer of last year, when the civil war started, the old man's family and property have undergone new changes in the flames of war.

Last year, when Chiang's troops invaded the north, it brought two misfortunes to Xie Tongling. One was that the fleeing landlord came back and forced him to pay the rent for the past few years. Xie Tongling also farmed a few mu of the landlord's land. The landlord demanded two or three sacks of grain per mu, and he barely managed to scrape together two sacks, but the landlord was still chasing after him. The other misfortune was that his eldest son, Jinshu, came home from the brigade and ran into Chiang's troops, who captured him. Just like that, they lost him. The old woman's eyes were red as she remembered her eldest son, saying, "Jinshu was excellent at everything he did in the brigade. He was smart and clever. Even now, when colleagues from the brigade come, they still ask if Jinshu has returned, but we haven't heard a word from him."

Once Chiang's troops passed, our guerrilla warfare started, and we arrested the landlords, forcing them to return the grain they had extorted. As a result, Xie Tongling received 40,000 Chiang banknotes. Then, during the guerrilla war, we implemented land reform and distributed another four mu of land. Now, he has already harvested mung beans and corn millet, which, together with his original two mu, makes a total of six mu of land. This is something that the old man had never experienced in his life.

After the wheat harvest this year, Chiang's troops and local bandits launched one mopping-up operation after another. The old woman described the scene after the wheat harvest, saying, "They searched every corner of our two rooms. Early in the morning, the old couple of us had just helped each other push a small vat of wheat flour, which we hid in the broken stove, blocked it from the outside, and covered it on top. But even that was found by those bastards. I tried to grab it back, saying that it was earned by the old couple of us picking one ear of wheat at a time. When I grabbed it, he knocked me down and I fainted on the spot. At that time, my daughter had just given birth. I bought half a catty of brown sugar, but the bastards took it, along with the eggs and a string of garlic. That time, it added up to more than ten thousand yuan." But the most unfortunate thing was that her third child died at the hands of Chiang's troops. When Chiang's troops came, the third child ran to the east field. Chiang's troops shot him in the face, and he died instantly. The old woman lowered her head and said, "After the eldest son was captured, we were only counting on this little third one. The little third one was eleven years old this year. That child was so sensible that he would rather be hungry than take other people's things, and he never fought or argued with other children..." At this point, she was already sobbing. "What kind of life are we old couple living? In the past, we had two daughters and two sons, so lively. Now that both daughters are married and both sons are gone, what's the point of living?" She added, "Now that you're here, I don't want you to leave. It's like you're one of my children." I stayed there, also lowered my head, and couldn't think of anything to say to comfort these two old people. I just suppressed my own tears so they wouldn't flow out. I have traveled through more than ten counties in Henan. None of the villages I have stayed in has been spared the brutal trampling of Chiang's bandit troops. I have seen the funeral of a young peasant who was beaten to death by Chiang's bandits, his wife crying so hard under the coffin that she was about to go crazy; I have seen many villages where it is impossible to find a single pot; I have seen the women who were raped gritting their teeth with hatred.... This is the general situation after Chiang's bandits rampaged through the area.

    冀鲁豫河南通讯：蒋匪带来的灾难
    文远
    【本报冀鲁豫二十三日电】中秋节后的第二天，我随军移驻考城谢湾村。房东老两口子对我们亲热极了。当天夜里，他们就在日光下捆秫楷，我跑上去，一说起话来，他们就倒开了苦水。老汉叫谢同领。当年分家时就只分了二亩地，给地主当了一辈子佃户，但到老来只落得一个痨病腔子。前几年地也不能多种了，就抽空卖油炸丸子，提烧饼篮子，拾粪，晒盐，什么法子都想到了，但终于还要了几年饭。
    老汉曾有三儿二女。二儿在三两岁上就死了。在前二年，大儿进书参加了考城县基干队，受政府优待，曾领到过一布袋谷子，一布袋高粱，生活才好了一点。但从去年夏天，内战开始，老头家的人和财产在战火中开始了新的变化。
    去年蒋军北犯，给谢老汉带来了两个不幸。一个是逃亡地主随着回来了，逼着要这几年的租子。谢老汉也种了地主几亩地。每亩即要两三布袋粮食，想尽办法才七凑八凑拿上两布袋粮食，但地主还在追着。另一件不幸的事，大儿进书在大队回家来，正巧碰上蒋军，被抓去了，就这样失去了。老太太眼睛红红的想起他大儿说：“进书在大队里，干什么都是好样的，又聪明，些伶俐，到现在大队那又同事来了，还老是问进书回来没有，可是到现在连个信也没有。”
    蒋军风头一过，我们的游击战争开展了，把地主抓起来，迫他倒出倒算去的粮食，这样谢老汉就要回来四万块蒋票。接着在游击战中实行了土地改革，又分了四亩地。现在已经收到家绿豆和玉茭黍了，连自己原有的二亩，共是六亩地。这在老汉一辈中是没有过的。
    今年麦后，蒋军土顽的扫荡一次又一次来了。老太太述说麦后那次情景说：“俺两个屋里什么都给翻遍了。俺老两口儿早上刚扶着棍推了一小缸麦子面，藏到破锅灶里，外面堵上，上边盖上，可是这也叫那些孬孙翻出来了。我给他夺，我说这是俺老两口一穗麦一穗麦拾来的，这一夺，他一下子把我碰倒了，当时就昏过去了。那时俺闺女正月子了，我买了半斤红糖，孬孙拿了，还有鸡子，一辫蒜，都拿走了。那一次算起来就是一万多块钱。”可是最不幸的是她的三孩子又死在蒋军手里。那时蒋军一来，他三小跑到东地里，蒋军一枪打在脸上，马上就死了。老太太低下头去说：“大儿被捉去以后，光指望着俺这个小三过了。小三今年十一，那小孩子多听说，他饿着也不要人家东西吃，从不给别的小孩打架、闹气、……”说到这里，已泣不成声。“俺老两口子这还过什么日子。过去有两个闺女，两个儿，多热闹，现在两个闺女都娶了，二个儿没有了，还有什么过头？”她又说：“您这来了，就不愿叫您走，就象俺的孩子一样。”我呆在那里，也低下头，想不出什么话可以安慰这两个老人家，只是抑制住自己的眼泪，好不流出来。在河南走过十多个县份了。所住过的村子，没有一个是幸免于蒋匪兽蹄的残踏的。我曾看见过被蒋匪打死的一个青年农民的出丧，他老婆倒在棺材下哭的快要疯了；我看到过许多村庄找不到一口锅；看到过妇女被污辱后的切齿痛恨……。这是蒋匪窜扰过的一般情景。
