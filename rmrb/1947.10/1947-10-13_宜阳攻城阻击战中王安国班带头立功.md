　　【This Dispatch from Taiyue on the 8th】Yu Xi News: Wang Anguo's Squad, a well-known hero squad under General Chen Geng, took the lead in capturing Yiyang City and achieved a brilliant record of zero casualties to sixty enemy casualties. After crossing the Luo River, Wang Anguo's Squad was ordered to hold the West Gate position to prevent Chiang bandit troops from escaping from the city. At that time, two groups of local reactionary landlords in the city attempted to break through the West Gate but were blocked by Wang Anguo's Squad, suffering heavy casualties. They also learned from a prisoner that the enemy intended to escape, so they bravely and calmly attacked Yiyang City. When the enemy's three breakthroughs were repelled, Wang Anguo took the lead with his entire squad in pursuing them. The follow-up troops outside the city heard the news and immediately entered the city, thus capturing Yiyang. Wang Anguo's Squad alone captured one 60mm mortar, three heavy machine guns, more than 200 rifles, one telephone switchboard, twelve telephones, and captured more than 60 enemy soldiers. Wang Anguo's Squad suffered no casualties.
　　【This Dispatch from Taiyue on the 11th】Yu Xi News: A propaganda team of a certain brigade of the southward army is spreading our Party's policies and visiting the masses to learn about their hardships everywhere. After the liberation of this township, the propaganda team immediately carried out propaganda in the city, first visiting households one by one, and then holding a merchants' and residents' meeting to publicize the policies on industry, commerce and trade, and giving street lectures to explain the announcements, etc. Another group of comrades conducted investigations, registered the poor, and distributed relief grain. Of the 400 households in the city, 365 households received relief, totaling 200 *shi* of grain. As a result, the masses quickly raised their awareness, regarding the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government as their own army and their own government, and immediately voluntarily reported to the government the ammunition and guns buried by the Chiang bandits. When they heard that our army needed stretchers, the masses volunteered to go, saying, "This is our own business."

　　宜阳攻城阻击战中王安国班带头立功
    【本报太岳八日电】豫西讯：陈赓将军所部著名英雄班王安国班，带头攻占宜阳城并获得零比六十的辉煌战果。王安国班在渡过洛水后，奉命坚持西关阵地阻击城内蒋匪逃窜。当时城内土顽即有两股向西门突围，当被王安国班阻击，死伤很大。又从一个俘虏口中知道了敌人企图逃跑时便以勇敢沉着的动作攻击宜阳城。当敌三次突围被打退时，王安国就带头全班跟迹追击，城外后续部队闻讯，当即攻入城去，就此占领了宜阳。仅王安国班缴获六○炮一门，重机枪三挺，步枪二百余支，电话总机一部，电话机十二部，俘敌六十余名，王安国班无一伤亡。
    【本报太岳十一日电】豫西讯：南下大军某旅宣传队，到处宣传我党政策，访问群众疾苦。这乡解放后，该宣传队即在城内进行宣传，首先挨户访问，后又召开商民大会，宣传工商贸易政策，并作街头讲演，解释布告等。另一部分同志又进行调查，登记贫苦，发放救济粮。全城四百余户，有三百六十五户获得救济，共发出粮食二百石。由此群众觉悟很快提高，把人民解放军和民主政府当作自己的军队和自己的政府，立即自动向政府报告了蒋匪埋藏的弹药与枪支。当听到我军要担架时，群众就自报奋勇的去了，并说：“这是咱们自己的事情。”
