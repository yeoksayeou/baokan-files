Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, August 8th: Late news: As the South Line People's Liberation Army launched a large-scale counter-offensive, marching mightily towards the Yangtze River, Yang Fa, a former Kuomintang army 41st Brigade artillery battalion captain and company commander, Ye Yu, a 26th Division field artillery battalion political office captain cadre, Wang Xunrong, a 274th Regiment transportation company captain, and Li Hanming, a 160th Brigade signal corps battalion radio platoon first-class station chief, along with forty-two other liberated army officers from Guangdong and Guangxi in the Coastal Shandong Military Region Officer Training Corps, jointly sent a telegram to the entire country in mid-September, declaring their withdrawal from the Chiang Kai-shek's Three People's Principles Youth League. They also firmly requested to join the Guangdong-Guangxi Column to fight for the liberation of their hometown compatriots from their suffering. The telegram stated: "We were originally a group of passionate youths from Guangdong and Guangxi. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, we volunteered or enlisted in the army to resist the Japanese invaders. After the victory, the traitorous bureaucrat government headed by Chiang Kai-shek coerced and enticed us, preventing us from demobilizing and forcing us to join the Kuomintang Three People's Principles Youth League. In July of last year, we were ordered to go to the civil war battlefield in North China to attack the people and serve as cannon fodder for the civil war. Fortunately, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army successively rescued us in northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong. Under the CCP's generous treatment and nearly a year of education, we have deeply realized Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of recognizing thieves as fathers, betraying the motherland, and slaughtering the people, and have become aware of the shame of being his pawns. Therefore, we hereby declare our withdrawal from the Kuomintang Three People's Principles Youth League, which has betrayed the nation and the country. We have requested to join the People's Liberation Army's Guangdong-Guangxi Column, determined to follow the PLA's counter-offensive army southwards, return to South China, and liberate our millions of fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters."

　　滨海两广籍被解放军官
  　要求参加两广纵队
  　通电脱离蒋介石三青团
    【新华社山东八日电】迟到消息：当南线人民解放军大举反攻，浩浩荡荡直奔长江之际，滨海解放军官训练处两广籍前蒋军四一旅炮兵营上尉连长杨发，二十六师野炮营政治室上尉干事叶玉，二七四团输送连上尉连长王勋荣及一六○旅通信兵营无线电排一级台长李汉明等四十六名被解放军官，于上月中旬联名通电全国，声明脱离蒋党三青团，并坚决要求参加两广纵队，为解放水深火热中的家乡同胞而奋斗。通电称：“我们原是两广的一群热血青年，抗战期中，抱着为抗击日寇而志愿或应征参军，胜利后，以蒋介石为首的卖国官僚政府，威迫利诱，不准我们复员，强迫我们加入国民党三青团。去年七月命令我们开赴华北内战战场，进攻人民，充当内战炮灰，幸蒙中共领导之人民解放军先后在苏北、鲁南把我们解救出来，在中共的宽大优待与将近一年的教育下，深切认识到蒋介石认贼作父，出卖祖国，屠杀人民的罪恶并觉悟到与之充当爪牙的耻辱。故特声明脱离背叛民族国家的国民党三青团。我们已请求参加人民解放军的两广纵队，决心追随解放军反攻大军南下；打回华南，解放我千万父老兄弟姊妹。”
